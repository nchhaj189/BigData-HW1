I GOT A DRUM AND WENT OVER TO THE POTATO FARM AND SPRINKLED IT ON THE VINES WITH A POT
AT THE TIME HE CABLED FOR ME EDISON WAS STILL AT MENLO PARK BUT WHEN I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK THE FAMOUS OFFICES OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY HAD BEEN OPENED AT 65 FIFTH AVENUE AND EDISON HAD MOVED INTO NEW YORK WITH THE IDEA OF ASSISTING IN THE EXPLOITATION OF THE LIGHT COMPANY'S BUSINESS
INDEED THE STORIES WOVEN AROUND HIS CASUAL SUGGESTIONS ARE TAME AND VAPID ALONGSIDE HIS OWN ESSAYS IN FICTION PROBABLY NEVER TO BE PUBLISHED BUT WHICH SHOW WHAT A REAL INVENTOR CAN DO WHEN HE CUTS LOOSE TO CREATE A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH UNRESTRAINED BY ANY FORMAL RESPECT FOR EXISTING CONDITIONS OF SERVITUDE TO THREE DIMENSIONS AND THE STANDARD ELEMENTS

I WAS UP AT 65 FIFTH AVENUE ONE AFTERNOON
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST THE CONCLUSION THAT THE INVENTION OF THE SLENDER THREAD OF CARBON AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE BURNERS PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED OPENED THE PATH TO THE PRACTICAL SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AN APPEAL WAS TAKEN IN THE ABOVE SUIT TO THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AND ON OCTOBER 4 1892 THE DECREE OF THE LOWER COURT WAS AFFIRMED
THE EDISON PHONOGRAPH INDUSTRY THUS ORGANIZED IS HELPED BY FREQUENT CONVENTIONS OF THIS LARGE COMMERCIAL FORCE
BEFORE HIM WAS SOMETHING REAL--WORK TO BE ACCOMPLISHED--A PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED
THE WHOLE TROUBLE IS AIR-BUBBLES
CRUDE AS THIS FIRST MODEL APPEARS IN COMPARISON WITH MACHINES OF LATER DEVELOPMENT AND REFINEMENT IT EMBODIED THEIR FUNDAMENTAL ESSENTIALS AND WAS IN FACT A COMPLETE PRACTICAL PHONOGRAPH FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF ITS OPERATION
THE SPIRIT OF PROGRESS SO PERVASIVE IN EDISON'S CHARACTER LED HIM HOWEVER TO RENEW HIS INVESTIGATIONS FURTHER AFIELD BY SENDING OUT TWO OTHER MEN TO EXAMINE THE BAMBOO AND SIMILAR GROWTHS OF THOSE PARTS OF SOUTH AMERICA NOT COVERED BY MR BRAUNER
IT CONTINUED TO BE A THEME OF CURIOUS INTEREST TO THE IMAGINATIVE AND THE SUBJECT OF MUCH FICTION WHILE ITS NEGLECTED COMMERCIAL POSSIBILITIES WERE STILL MORE OR LESS VAGUELY REFERRED TO
HE KNEW A TELEGRAPH OPERATOR HERE AND ON HIM HE DEPENDED FOR A LOAN TO TIDE HIM OVER UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HE SHOULD SECURE A POSITION
OF THE WHOLE MASS WOULD PASS THROUGH A 200-MESH SCREEN
IN THOSE DAYS NO USE WAS MADE OF THE SMOKING-COMPARTMENT AS THERE WAS NO VENTILATION AND IT WAS TURNED OVER TO YOUNG EDISON WHO NOT ONLY KEPT PAPERS THERE AND HIS STOCK OF GOODS AS A CANDY BUTCHER BUT SOON HAD IT EQUIPPED WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY VARIETY OF APPARATUS
NOT ONLY TO HIS WORK AND INGENUITY IS DUE THE PRESENT MAGNITUDE OF THESE ARTS AND INDUSTRIES BUT IT IS ATTRIBUTABLE ALSO TO THE SPLENDID WORK AND NUMEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS OF OTHER GREAT INVENTORS SUCH AS BRUSH BELL ELIHU THOMSON WESTON SPRAGUE AND MANY OTHERS AS WELL AS TO THE FINANCIERS AND INVESTORS WHO IN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS HAVE FURNISHED THE VAST SUMS OF MONEY THAT WERE NECESSARY TO EXPLOIT AND PUSH FORWARD THESE ENTERPRISES
THIS ELECTRICIAN APPEARED TO WANT GLORY MORE THAN MONEY SO IT WAS AN EASY TRADE
IF I EVER HAD ANY CONCEIT IT VANISHED FROM MY BOOTS UP
IF WE WERE NOT THERE HE COULD COME DOWN TO THE SLUMS AT GOERCK STREET AND WOULD PLAY FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AND TALK PHILOSOPHY
THE ANSWER TO THIS IS DECIDEDLY IN THE NEGATIVE FOR THE FACT IS THAT HE LAID SOME OF THE FOUNDATION AND ERECTED A BUILDING THEREON AND IN THE NATURAL PROGRESSIVE ORDER OF THINGS OTHER INVENTORS OF MORE OR LESS FAME HAVE LAID SUBSTRUCTURES OR ADDED A WING HERE AND A STORY THERE UNTIL THE RESULTANT GREAT STRUCTURE HAS ATTAINED SUCH PROPORTIONS AS TO EVOKE THE ADMIRATION OF THE BEHOLDER
THE NIGHT WAS INTENSELY WARM
THEY SAW I WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SELL IT AND THEY WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY NECESSITY
THE LITTLE GLASS-KNOB INSULATORS MADE SEDUCTIVE TARGETS FOR IGNORANT SPORTSMEN
ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
IN THE SECOND PLACE THE COMING OF THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT RAISED THE STANDARD OF ILLUMINATION IN SUCH A MANNER THAT MORE GAS THAN EVER WAS WANTED IN ORDER TO SATISFY THE POPULAR DEMAND FOR BRIGHTNESS AND BRILLIANCY BOTH INDOORS AND ON THE STREET
BUT THE COURSE OF CIVILIZATION HAS BEEN MARKED BY AN ARTIFICIAL LENGTHENING OF THE DAY AND BY A CONSTANT STRIVING AFTER MORE PERFECT MEANS OF ILLUMINATION
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO THE MODERN ELECTRICIAN TO NOTE THAT WHEN THIS PIONEER STATION WAS STARTED AND IN FACT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME AFTERWARD THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENT IN THE WHOLE STATION--NOT A VOLTMETER OR AN AMMETER
THIS SYSTEM WAS EXPLOITED THROUGH THE USE OF A MODERATELY PAID CLERICAL FORCE
CO
BYLLESBY AND THE LATE LUTHER STIERINGER WAS COMPLETED AND IN OPERATION WITHIN SIX WEEKS AFTER THE PLACING OF THE ORDER
IN THIS CASE THE IRON PINS MARK THE PAPER TAPE BUT THE TELLURIUM PINS MAKE NO MARK
THE DEALINGS IN GOLD DURING THE CIVIL WAR AND AFTER ITS CLOSE HAD BROUGHT GOLD INDICATORS INTO USE AND THESE HAD SOON BEEN FOLLOWED BY STOCK TICKERS THE FIRST OF WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN NEW YORK IN 1867
IN ENGLAND FOR EXAMPLE THE MICROSCOPIC COMPANY PAID $7500 DOWN AND AGREED TO A ROYALTY WHILE ARRANGEMENTS WERE EFFECTED ALSO IN FRANCE RUSSIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES
THE LOYALIST MOVEMENT THAT TOOK TO NOVA SCOTIA SO MANY AMERICANS AFTER THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE CARRIED WITH IT JOHN THE SON OF THIS STALWART CONTINENTAL
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THE PHONOGRAPH LAY DORMANT COMMERCIALLY SPEAKING FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS AFTER IT CAME INTO BEING AND THEN LATER INVENTION REDUCED IT TO A DEVICE CAPABLE OF MORE POPULAR UTILITY
SEWARD AND GROSVENOR P
WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE DEPOT MR ROBERTS WAS THERE AND INSISTED ON CARRYING MY SATCHEL FOR ME
THIS BROUGHT THE CORPORAL ALONG THE HALF MILE ONLY TO FIND THAT HE WAS FOOLED
THIS PRESSURE WAS APPLIED IN A MOST INGENIOUS MANNER
THE CONDITIONS WERE PECULIAR
WHEN THE KEY IS RELEASED THE CYLINDER CONTINUES IN MOTION
AFTER THE RAILROAD HAD BEEN OPENED A SHORT TIME THEY PUT ON AN EXPRESS WHICH LEFT DETROIT IN THE MORNING AND RETURNED IN THE EVENING
CARBON TETRACHLORIDE NOW MADE ELECTRICALLY AT NIAGARA FALLS IS VERY CHEAP AND WOULD BE IDEAL FOR THE PURPOSE EDISON HAS NEVER PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO WARFARE AND HAS IN GENERAL DISDAINED TO DEVELOP INVENTIONS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF LIFE AND PROPERTY
AN ICE-JAM HAD BROKEN THE LIGHT TELEGRAPH CABLE LAID IN THE BED OF THE RIVER ACROSS TO SARNIA AND THUS COMMUNICATION WAS INTERRUPTED
AND THIS BROKE UP THE SALES IT HAS GENERALLY BEEN SUPPOSED THAT EDISON DID NOT TAKE UP WORK ON THE STOCK TICKER UNTIL AFTER HIS ARRIVAL A LITTLE LATER IN NEW YORK
IT SHOWS A LITTLE SOLENOID ARRANGEMENT WITH ONE END OF THE PLUNGER ATTACHED TO THE DIAPHRAGM OF A SPEAKING OR RESONATING CHAMBER
GOULD SEEMED TO BE IN CHARGE FISK BEING THE EXECUTIVE DOWN-TOWN
THE PHILOSOPHY OF THIS INVENTION HAVING ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED IN CHAPTER XXI IT WILL BE UNNECESSARY TO REPEAT IT HERE
YOUNG MAN I WANT YOU TO WORK THE LOUISVILLE WIRE NIGHTS
IT IS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT EDISON WAS GREETED WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC HOMAGE OF THE WHOLE FRENCH PEOPLE
NOW I REPLIED I WAS THEN TOLD TO RETURN AT 5.30 P.M AND PUNCTUALLY AT THAT HOUR I ENTERED THE MAIN OPERATING-ROOM AND WAS INTRODUCED TO THE NIGHT MANAGER
THERE WERE THREE ROOMS ON THE GROUND FLOOR AT THAT TIME
AND ANDREW CARNEGIE THE GREATEST IRONMASTER THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN AS WELL AS ITS GREATEST PHILANTHROPIST
WITH THIS HE APPLIED TO THE ORIGINAL RECORD A FILM OF GOLD PROBABLY NO THICKER THAN ONE THREE-HUNDRED-THOUSANDTH OF AN INCH OR SEVERAL HUNDRED TIMES LESS THAN THE DEPTH OF AN AVERAGE WAVE
EDISON CAME FIRST TO NEW YORK IN 1868 WITH HIS EARLY STOCK PRINTER WHICH HE TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO SELL
HE WAS TO PAY ME $2000 A YEAR FOR THE RENT OF THE MACHINERY AND KEEP IT IN GOOD ORDER
WITH A SIMPLE CIRCUIT THEREFORE BETWEEN TWO STATIONS AND WHERE AN INTERMEDIATE BATTERY IS NOT NECESSARY A RELAY IS NOT USED
PLANS TO THAT END WERE NOW RAPIDLY MATURING
EIGHT FORMS OF ELECTRIC LAMPS USING INFUSIBLE EARTHY OXIDES AND BROUGHT TO HIGH INCANDESCENCE IN VACUO BY HIGH POTENTIAL CURRENT OF SEVERAL THOUSAND VOLTS
HE HAD DISCOVERED THE HIDDEN PASSAGE AND HELD THE CLEW WHICH HE HAD SO INDUSTRIOUSLY SOUGHT
EDISON'S PREVIOUS DISCOVERY OF DIFFERENTIAL FRICTION OF SURFACES THROUGH ELECTROCHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION WAS NOW ADAPTED BY HIM TO PRODUCE MOTION AT THE END OF A CIRCUIT WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF AN ELECTROMAGNET
THESE INCLUDED THE CHIEF CITIES ON THE SEABOARD BUFFALO CHICAGO AND OMAHA
TO ENTER INTO ANY DESCRIPTION OF THE ALMOST INNUMERABLE EXPERIMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS THAT WERE MADE WOULD ENTAIL THE WRITING OF SEVERAL VOLUMES FOR MR EDISON'S CLOSE-WRITTEN NOTE-BOOKS COVERING THESE SUBJECTS NUMBER NEARLY TWO HUNDRED
THE OFFICE EMPLOYEES WERE THE CARMAN BROTHERS AND THE LATE JOHN F
SO I ASKED HIM TO MAKE ME AN OFFER
FINALLY IT DISTURBED THESE COMMITTEES SO MUCH AND RAISED SO MANY DOUBTS IN THEIR MINDS THAT ONE OF MY CHIEF ASSOCIATES SAID
THE SERIES SYSTEM IT WILL BE SEEN PRESENTS ONE CONTINUOUS PATH FOR THE CURRENT
IN TALKING WITH ME ONE DAY ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES UNDER WHICH WE WERE WORKING AND CONTRASTING THEM WITH THE PHONOGRAPH EXPERIMENTATION EDISON SAID
HE SAID HE WAS A JEW BUT THERE WAS NO DISTINCTIVE FEATURE TO VERIFY THIS ASSERTION
A TWO MONTHS INVESTIGATION OF THE LATTER ISLAND REVEALED A VARIETY OF BAMBOO GROWTHS OF WHICH A GREAT NUMBER OF SPECIMENS WERE OBTAINED AND SHIPPED TO MENLO PARK
ON THE ARRIVAL AT MOUNT CLEMENS STATION ITS NEXT STOP EDISON AND HIS ENTIRE OUTFIT LABORATORY PRINTING-PLANT AND ALL WERE PROMPTLY EJECTED BY THE ENRAGED CONDUCTOR AND THE TRAIN THEN MOVED OFF LEAVING HIM ON THE PLATFORM TEARFUL AND INDIGNANT IN THE MIDST OF HIS BELOVED BUT RUINED POSSESSIONS
MARCH 8 1881 248,419 ELECTRIC LAMP
BUT IT WAS NOT VERY NOTICEABLE
8 HAVING A CURRENT OF RELATIVELY HIGH PRESSURE TO CONTEND WITH IT WAS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A CARBON BURNER WHICH AS COMPARED WITH WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SUGGESTED SHOULD HAVE A VERY GREAT RESISTANCE
ANOTHER SERIOUS DIFFICULTY CONFRONTING EDISON AND HIS ASSOCIATES WAS THAT NOWHERE IN THE WORLD WERE THERE TO BE PURCHASED ANY OF THE APPLIANCES NECESSARY FOR THE USE OF THE LIGHTING SYSTEM
HIS ELECTROLYTIC METER WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND WAS OF WIDESPREAD USE IN AMERICA AND IN EUROPE UNTIL THE PERFECTION OF MECHANICAL METERS BY ELIHU THOMSON AND OTHERS BROUGHT THAT TYPE INTO GENERAL ACCEPTANCE
THE FAILURE OF AN EXPERIMENT SIMPLY MEANT TO HIM THAT HE HAD FOUND SOMETHING ELSE THAT WOULD NOT WORK THUS BRINGING THE POSSIBLE GOAL A LITTLE NEARER BY A PROCESS OF PAINSTAKING ELIMINATION
EACH LAMP IS PLACED IN A SEPARATE CIRCUIT ACROSS THESE TWO CONDUCTORS LIKE A RUNG IN THE LADDER THUS MAKING A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT PATH FOR THE CURRENT IN EACH CASE
THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS UTTER NEGLECT OF THE CLOCK
AFTER WE GOT IN THE ORE DID COME DOWN AND THERE WERE FOURTEEN TONS OF IT ABOVE US
WELL COLONEL HOW DID YOU COME OUT ON THAT EXPERIMENT?'--REFERRING TO SOME SUGGESTIONS HE HAD MADE AT THEIR LAST MEETING A YEAR BEFORE
THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT CENTURY FOUND HIM AT HIS POINT OF NEW DEPARTURE
MANY THERE WERE WHO STOOD READY TO FURNISH AFFIDAVITS THAT THEY OR SOME ONE ELSE WHOM THEY CONTROLLED HAD REALLY INVENTED THE LAMP BUT WOULD OBLIGINGLY WITHDRAW AND LEAVE EDISON IN POSSESSION OF THE FIELD ON PAYMENT OF MONEY
BEFORE THE INCANDESCENT LAMP WAS PERFECTED THE ONLY ILLUMINATION WAS FROM GASOLINE GAS
BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHER INTERESTING POINTS THAT MAY BE TOUCHED ON NOW IN REGARD TO A FEW OF EDISON'S FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL VENTURES NOT GENERALLY KNOWN OR APPRECIATED
THE FIGURES MARKED L REPRESENT EIGHT LAMPS OF 110 VOLTS EACH IN MULTIPLE SERIES OF TWO IN FOUR DERIVED CIRCUITS
IT HAS BEEN A ROMANCE OF POPULAR BIOGRAPHERS BASED UPON THE FACT THAT EDISON BEGAN HIS CAREER AS A NEWSBOY TO ASSUME THAT THESE EARLIER YEARS WERE SPENT IN POVERTY AND PRIVATION AS INDEED THEY USUALLY ARE BY THE NEWSIES WHO SWARM AND SHOUT THEIR PAPERS IN OUR LARGE CITIES
NO ATTEMPT IS MADE TO INCLUDE FIGURES OF COLLATERAL INDUSTRIES SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS COPPER WHICH IS VERY CLOSELY ALLIED WITH THE ELECTRICAL ARTS AND THE GREAT BULK OF WHICH IS REFINED ELECTRICALLY
THE DIALS OR WHEELS BEING ARRANGED IN A ROW HORIZONTALLY OVERLAPPING EACH OTHER AS IN MODERN FARE REGISTERS WHICH ARE NOW SEEN ON MOST TROLLEY CARS
IN THAT ONE DAY'S DESIGNING PROVISION WAS MADE NOT ONLY FOR ALL IMPORTANT PARTS BUT MINOR DETAILS SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS THE CARRYING OF ALL STEAM WATER AND AIR PIPES AND ELECTRICAL CONDUCTORS IN A LARGE SUBWAY RUNNING FROM ONE END OF THE PLANT TO THE OTHER
AS AN OPERATOR HE HAD NO SUPERIORS AND VERY FEW EQUALS
MARCH 30 1882 274,576 TRANSMITTING TELEPHONE MARCH 30 1882 274,577 TELEPHONE
THE MOVE WAS DUE TO TROUBLE I HAD ABOUT RENT
HE WAS SIX FEET IN HEIGHT OF GREAT BODILY VIGOR AND OF SUCH PERSONAL DOMINANCE OF CHARACTER THAT HE BECAME A CAPTAIN OF THE INSURGENT FORCES RALLYING UNDER THE BANNERS OF PAPINEAU AND MACKENZIE
A WORD OR TWO MAY BE DEVOTED TO THE VISITORS RECEIVED AT THE LABORATORY AND TO THE CORRESPONDENCE
THE YEARS OF HARDSHIP AND STRUGGLE ARE THUS PROLONGED THE CHAGRIN OF POVERTY AND NEGLECT TOO FREQUENTLY EMBITTERS THE INVENTOR'S SCANTY BREAD
WITH HER HE FOUND STUDY EASY AND PLEASANT
IN HIS TRACTION WORK HE HAD A CLOSE SECOND IN ROBERT DAVIDSON OF ABERDEEN SCOTLAND WHO IN 1839 OPERATED BOTH A LATHE AND A SMALL LOCOMOTIVE WITH THE MOTOR HE HAD INVENTED
THE UNINJURED JUMBO NO
WHEN MR EDISON FIRST DECIDED TO GO INTO THE CEMENT BUSINESS IT WAS ON THE BASIS OF HIS CRUSHING-ROLLS AND AIR SEPARATION AND HE HAD EVERY EXPECTATION OF INSTALLING DUPLICATES OF THE KILNS WHICH WERE THEN IN COMMON USE FOR BURNING CEMENT
THE DATA SECURED BY THE UNITED STATES CENSUS OFFICE IN 1902 SHOWED THAT THE WHOLE INDUSTRY HAD MADE GIGANTIC LEAPS IN EIGHT YEARS AND HAD 2,371,044 TELEPHONE STATIONS IN SERVICE OF WHICH 1,053,866 WERE WHOLLY OR NOMINALLY INDEPENDENT OF THE BELL

AND HENCE THAT BUSTLING HOME OF SHOE MANUFACTURE WAS SPARED THIS INFLICTION OF MORE OVERHEAD WIRES
SUCH FIRE ALARMS CAN BE EXCHANGED AUTOMATICALLY OR BY OPERATORS AND ARE SOMETIMES ASSOCIATED WITH A LARGE FIRE-ALARM BELL OR WHISTLE
BOTH WERE GENERATORS OF ELECTRICAL CURRENT BUT SO DIFFERENT IN CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION THAT RULES APPLICABLE TO THE PRACTICAL USE OF THE ONE DID NOT APPLY WITH PROPER COMMERCIAL EFFICIENCY TO THE OTHER

WHEN I CAME OPPOSITE THE TWO YOUNG MEN ONE OF THEM SAID
MR SAMUEL INSULL DESCRIBES THE BUSINESS METHODS WHICH PREVAILED THROUGHOUT THE EARLIER MENLO PARK DAYS OF STORM AND STRESS AND THE CURIOUS CONDITIONS WITH WHICH HE HAD TO DEAL AS PRIVATE SECRETARY

ON LEAVING THE GIANT ROLLS THE ROCKS HAVING BEEN REDUCED TO PIECES NOT LARGER THAN FOURTEEN INCHES PASSED INTO THE SERIES OF INTERMEDIATE ROLLS OF SIMILAR CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION BY WHICH THEY WERE STILL FURTHER REDUCED AND AGAIN PASSED ON TO THREE OTHER SETS OF ROLLS OF SMALLER DIMENSIONS
THIS DECISION WAS REACHED ONLY AFTER THE MOST CAREFUL INVESTIGATIONS AND CALCULATIONS AS MR EDISON WAS JUST AS FULL OF FIGHT AND AMBITION TO MAKE IT A SUCCESS AS WHEN HE FIRST STARTED
INSULATED WIRES WERE WOUND UPON REELS TWO MEN AND A MULE DETAILED TO EACH REEL

ARGENTINE
STRANGE TO SAY HOWEVER THE TRUE IMPORT AND PRACTICAL APPLICABILITY OF THESE PHENOMENA DID NOT OCCUR TO HIS MIND
ALL THESE WERE SUBSTANTIALLY BUILT OF BRICK
ONE NIGHT I GOT AN ORDER TO HOLD A FREIGHT TRAIN AND I REPLIED THAT I WOULD
AS I WAS QUITE ALONE IN THE WORLD--POOR--I HAD FOUND A FRIEND WHO KNEW WHAT HE WANTED AND EXPLAINED IT CLEARLY
THIS CONSISTS OF AN ELECTROMAGNET T OPERATED BY A KEY K AND SEPARATE BATTERY
EDISON HAD HIMSELF MORE THAN ONE NARROW ESCAPE
VILLARD HAS OFTEN BEEN BLAMED AND SEVERELY CRITICISED BUT HE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE TO BLAME
IT ALWAYS RECALLED TO ME WHAT I VENTURE NOW SINCE MY FRIEND BREAKS IN UPON ME IN THIS RUDE MANNER TO TELL THE COURT AS WELL ILLUSTRATIVE OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE
INSTEAD OF USING A DISK I DESIGNED A LITTLE MACHINE USING A CYLINDER PROVIDED WITH GROOVES AROUND THE SURFACE
TRY THIS ONE OVER IN EVERY CASE THE SECOND TEST PROVED THAT HE WAS RIGHT
MR EDISON DOES NOT REMEMBER THAT HE EVER RECURRED TO THIS VERY INTERESTING TEST
IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF THIS LUBRICATING SYSTEM THERE OCCURRED ANOTHER INSTANCE OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MATERIALS AND INTUITIVE INSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF THINGS
I SAID I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY SO WE WENT UP INTO THE BILLIARD-ROOM OF THE HOUSE
THIS CONTINUED ALL WINTER AND MANY WERE THE OCCASIONS WHEN I WAS NEARLY FROZEN IN THE ELIZABETH WALK THIS DOCTOR BRADLEY APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST IN THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PRECISION WITH THE GALVANOMETER BUT WAS AN OLD-SCHOOL EXPERIMENTER WHO WOULD WORK FOR YEARS ON AN INSTRUMENT WITHOUT COMMERCIAL VALUE
WE MAKE NO CRITICISM OF OUR FEDERAL JUDGES
OF COURSE IT CAUGHT FIRE
EVEN ADMITTING THAT THE SIZE AND WEIGHT OF HIS LOW-TENSION CONDUCTORS NECESSITATED PUTTING THEM UNDERGROUND THIS ARGUES NOTHING AGAINST THE PROPRIETY AND SANITY OF HIS METHODS
HE WAS ALSO EXTREMELY IRASCIBLE AND WHEN ON ONE OCCASION THE CONNECTING WIRE WOULD NOT COME OUT OF ONE OF THE BINDING POSTS OF A NEW AND COSTLY GALVANOMETER HE JERKED THE INSTRUMENT TO THE FLOOR AND THEN JUMPED ON IT
AND THERE WAS THE DEVIL TO PAY
EXISTING MACHINERY FOR THIS PURPOSE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ON THE BASIS OF MINING METHODS THEN IN VOGUE BY WHICH THE ROCK WAS THOROUGHLY SHATTERED BY MEANS OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES AND REDUCED TO PIECES OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS OR LESS
AMONG THE INTERESTING PAPERS FILED AT THE ORANGE LABORATORY IS A LITHOGRAPH THE SIZE OF AN ORDINARY PATENT DRAWING HEADED FIRST TELEPHONE ON RECORD THE CLAIM THUS MADE GOES BACK TO THE PERIOD WHEN ALL WAS WAR AND WHEN DISPUTE WAS HOT AND RIFE AS TO THE ACTUAL INVENTION OF THE TELEPHONE
IT WAS THE PRACTICE OF THE PRESS OPERATORS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME WHEN A LULL OCCURRED TO START IN AND SEND JOKES OR STORIES THE DAY MEN HAD COLLECTED
FOR INSTANCE IN THE VERY EARLIEST DAYS OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING THE SAFE INSULATION OF TWO BARE WIRES FASTENED TOGETHER WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT WAS SOLVED BY HIM
THE MIRROR AS IT MOVES THROWS A BEAM OF LIGHT UPON A SCALE AND THE INDICATIONS ARE READ BY THE SPOT OF LIGHT
THIS WAS INTERPRETED TO MEAN
STILL THE EXPLANATIONS WERE MADE IN GERMAN
THIS GOEBEL CLAIM WAS THEN INVESTIGATED BY THE LEADING COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE MR CURTIS
THE CARBON FILAMENT WHICH CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NEW PART OF THE COMBINATION OF THE SECOND CLAIM OF THAT PATENT DIFFERS FROM THE EARLIER CARBON BURNERS OF SAWYER AND MAN ONLY IN HAVING A DIAMETER OF ONE SIXTY-FOURTH OF AN INCH OR LESS WHEREAS THE BURNERS OF SAWYER AND MAN HAD A DIAMETER OF ONE-THIRTY-SECOND OF AN INCH OR MORE
THE RESULT WAS HIS AUTOMATIC ROMAN LETTER SYSTEM THE BASIS FOR WHICH INCLUDED THE ABOVE-NAMED GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PERFORATED TRANSMISSION TAPE AND ELECTROCHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION
THE BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT OF PRIVATE TELEGRAPH LINES WAS ALSO ENTERED UPON
AFTER ATTAINING A HIGH DEGREE OF PERFECTION WITH THESE LAMPS HE RECOGNIZED THEIR IMPRACTICABLE CHARACTER AND HIS MIND REVERTED TO THE OPINION HE HAD FORMED IN HIS EARLY EXPERIMENTS TWO YEARS BEFORE--VIZ THAT CARBON HAD THE REQUISITE RESISTANCE TO PERMIT A VERY SIMPLE CONDUCTOR TO ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECT IF IT COULD BE USED IN THE FORM OF A HAIR-LIKE FILAMENT PROVIDED THE FILAMENT ITSELF COULD BE MADE SUFFICIENTLY HOMOGENEOUS
AT THE VARIOUS TOWNS THERE WERE CORRESPONDING CROWDS
WE ENJOYED THE SPORT IMMENSELY IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THIS WAS OVER FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS NO POPULAR INSTRUCTION IN ELECTRICITY AND WHEN ITS POSSIBILITIES FOR PRACTICAL JOKING WERE KNOWN TO VERY FEW
DURING THE MANY YEARS OF LAMP EXPERIMENTATION BATCHES OF LAMPS WERE SENT TO THE PHOTOMETER DEPARTMENT FOR TEST AND EDISON WOULD EXAMINE THE TABULATED TEST SHEETS
HE COULD WORK CONTINUOUSLY AS LONG AS HE WISHED AND HAD SLEEP AT HIS COMMAND
THE DEMONSTRATION WAS HOWEVER SUFFICIENTLY SUCCESSFUL TO IMPEL JAY GOULD TO CONTRACT TO PAY ABOUT $4,000,000 IN STOCK FOR THE PATENTS
THE MORAL RISK IS TOO GREAT ALL RIGHT
NOT ONLY IN RELATION TO HIS ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER INVENTIONS HAS THE PROGRESS OF EDISON AND HIS ASSOCIATES BEEN ATTENDED BY LEGAL CONTROVERSY ALL THROUGH THE YEARS OF THEIR EXPLOITATION BUT ALSO IN RESPECT TO OTHER INVENTIONS NOTABLY THOSE RELATING TO THE PHONOGRAPH AND TO MOTION PICTURES
THE NEEDLE IN PASSING RAPIDLY IN CONTACT WITH THE RECORDED WAVES WAS VIBRATED UP AND DOWN CAUSING CORRESPONDING VIBRATIONS OF THE DIAPHRAGM
I HAD TO DEVISE A WAY OF RAISING THE VOLTAGE WITHOUT CHANGING THE MACHINE WHICH I DID BY ADDING EXTRA MAGNETS
THESE BEGINNERS WERE ALSO INSTRUCTED IN GENERAL ENGINEERING PROBLEMS UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF MR C
NOTE IS MADE OF AN ARTICLE IN APRIL 1879 PUTTING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GAS INVESTMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD AT THAT TIME AT $1,500,000,000
THE CARBON DISK IS REPRESENTED BY THE BLACK PORTION E NEAR THE DIAPHRAGM A PLACED BETWEEN TWO PLATINUM PLATES D AND G WHICH ARE CONNECTED IN THE BATTERY CIRCUIT AS SHOWN BY THE LINES
BUT THERE IS A SATISFACTORY RATIONAL EXPLANATION WHICH I BELIEVE CAN BE MADE PLAIN TO PERSONS OF ORDINARY INTELLIGENCE
I SIGNED WITHOUT READING IT EDISON WAS THEN HANDED THE FIRST CHECK HE HAD EVER RECEIVED ONE FOR $40,000 DRAWN ON THE BANK OF NEW YORK AT THE CORNER OF WILLIAM AND WALL STREETS
31 1888 435,690 MAKING ARMATURES FOR DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINES AUG
AS TO THE STORAGE BATTERY THE PLANT AT SILVER LAKE IS RESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS NICKEL-HYDRATE AND IRON OXIDE WHICH ENTER INTO ITS CONSTRUCTION
TO WHICH HE REPLIED LAUGHINGLY
I WAS AFRAID HE WOULD HEAR MY HEART BEAT
I ASKED ONE OF THE WAITERS CONCERNING THE BOAT ITSELF AND WAS TAKEN TO SEE THE ENGINEER AND WENT DOWN TO LOOK AT THE ENGINES AND SAW THE CAPTAIN
THESE WERE CARRIED THROUGH A LONG SERIES OF CHARGES AND DISCHARGES UNDER STRICT TEST CONDITIONS
THEREFORE THE CRUCIAL POINT WAS THE PRODUCTION OF A HAIR-LIKE CARBON FILAMENT WITH A RELATIVELY GREAT RESISTANCE AND SMALL RADIATING SURFACE CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING MECHANICAL SHOCK AND SUSCEPTIBLE OF BEING MAINTAINED AT A TEMPERATURE OF OVER TWO THOUSAND DEGREES FOR A THOUSAND HOURS OR MORE BEFORE BREAKING
THE NEXT STEP IN THE LINE OF DEVELOPMENT WAS TO FORM THE NECESSARY UNDULATIONS ON THE STRIP AND IT WAS THEN REASONED THAT ORIGINAL SOUNDS THEMSELVES MIGHT BE UTILIZED TO FORM A GRAPHIC RECORD BY ACTUATING A DIAPHRAGM AND CAUSING A CUTTING OR INDENTING POINT CARRIED THEREBY TO VIBRATE IN CONTACT WITH A MOVING SURFACE SO AS TO CUT OR INDENT THE RECORD THEREIN
THE DOG WAS WHIRLED AROUND FORTY OR FIFTY TIMES AND A LITTLE FLAT PIECE OF LEATHER CAME OUT--AND THE LADIES FAINTED A VERY INTERESTING PERIOD ON THE SOCIAL SIDE WAS THE VISIT PAID BY EDISON AND HIS FAMILY TO EUROPE IN 1889 WHEN HE HAD MADE A SPLENDID EXHIBIT OF HIS INVENTIONS AND APPARATUS AT THE GREAT PARIS CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION OF THAT YEAR TO THE EXTREME DELIGHT OF THE FRENCH WHO WELCOMED HIM WITH OPEN ARMS
THE LITERATURE OF THE ART IS FULL OF BETTER LAMPS ALL OF WHICH ARE HELD NOT TO ANTICIPATE THE EDISON PATENT
WHEN IT IS STATED HOWEVER THAT A STOCK CLERK IS KEPT EXCEEDINGLY BUSY ALL DAY ANSWERING THE NUMEROUS AND VARIOUS DEMANDS UPON HIM THE READER WILL APPRECIATE THAT THIS COMPREHENSIVE ASSORTMENT IS NOT MERELY A FAD OF EDISON'S BUT STANDS RATHER AS A SUBSTANTIAL TRIBUTE TO HIS WIDE-ANGLED VIEW OF POSSIBLE REQUIREMENTS AS HIS VARIOUS INVESTIGATIONS TAKE HIM FAR AFIELD
4 ARE ALL MADE OF NICKEL-PLATED STEEL--A MATERIAL IN WHICH LIGHTNESS DURABILITY AND MECHANICAL STRENGTH ARE MOST HAPPILY COMBINED AND A MATERIAL BEYOND SUSPICION AS TO CORROSION IN AN ALKALINE ELECTROLYTE
MAREY OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY WHO IN 1874 HAD PUBLISHED A WELL-KNOWN TREATISE ON ANIMAL MOVEMENT WAS ABLE BY THE USE OF DRY PLATES TO CARRY FORWARD THE EXPERIMENTS OF MUYBRIDGE ON A GREATLY REFINED SCALE
IT HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF BACKING EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS
WOOD WILL ROT STONE WILL CHIP AND CRUMBLE BRICKS DISINTEGRATE BUT A CEMENT AND IRON STRUCTURE IS APPARENTLY INDESTRUCTIBLE
SUCH A LINE WOULD BE LONG OR SHORT ACCORDING TO THE DURATION OF THE ELECTRIC IMPULSE
I HAVE BEEN TO LUNCH WITH YOU SEVERAL TIMES
I HAD HIM THERE TO HELP IN EXPERIMENTING AND THE HEART-DISEASE DID NOT SEEM TO BOTHER HIM AT ALL
AT THE SAME TIME SUCH A LAMP MUST REQUIRE A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF CURRENT IN ORDER THAT COMPARATIVELY SMALL CONDUCTORS COULD BE USED AND ITS BURNER MUST BE CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING THE NECESSARILY HIGH TEMPERATURES WITHOUT DISINTEGRATION
IN OTHER WORDS A VERY SLIGHT DROP IN VOLTAGE MEANS A DISPROPORTIONATELY GREAT LOSS IN ILLUMINATION
12 1889 406,570 PHONOGRAPH FEB
THE CONSTANT OUTPOURING OF PRODUCTS IN SUCH LARGE QUANTITIES BESPEAKS THE UNREMITTING ACTIVITIES OF AN EXTENSIVE AND BUSY SELLING ORGANIZATION TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
THE AMOUNT OF HEAT LOST BY A BODY IS IN PROPORTION TO THE RADIATING SURFACE OF THAT BODY
EDISON'S METHOD IN INVENTING XXV
NOW I'M GLAD I HELD ON FOR WE'VE GOT A GREAT FUTURE THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING GOOD ELECTRICAL CONTACT IN THE POSITIVE ELEMENT WAS INDEED EDISON'S CHIEF TROUBLE FOR MANY YEARS
HE WENT TO THE HOOK GRABBED THE BUNCH AND LOOKED AT IT AS A WHOLE WITHOUT EXAMINING IT IN DETAIL FOR WHICH I WAS THANKFUL
EVERY HOISTWAY TO WHICH AN ELECTRIC MOTOR COULD BE APPLIED
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-SEVEN IN EDISON'S LABORATORY WAS A VERITABLE CARBON YEAR FOR IT WAS CARBON IN SOME SHAPE OR FORM FOR INTERPOLATION IN ELECTRIC CIRCUITS OF VARIOUS KINDS THAT OCCUPIED THE THOUGHTS OF THE WHOLE FORCE FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
IT WAS FOR ME TO MEET MR JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN
SO INSISTENT WAS HE ON THIS THAT IF ANY AUTOMOBILE SHOULD RUN SEVERAL DAYS WITHOUT BURSTING A TIRE OR BREAKING SOME PART OF THE MACHINE HE WOULD ACCUSE THE CHAUFFEUR OF PICKING OUT EASY ROADS
I WISH YOU WOULD TAKE MY LUNG EXPANSION TOO THE DOCTOR TOOK IT AND HIS SURPRISE WAS VERY GREAT AS IT WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST ON RECORD
HE WAS IMPLORED FOR BATTERIES BUT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT GOOD RESULTS HAD BEEN OBTAINED FROM THE 18,000 OR 20,000 CELLS SOLD SOME YEARS AGO HE ADHERED FIRMLY TO HIS DETERMINATION TO PERFECT THEM TO A STILL HIGHER STANDARD BEFORE RESUMING AND CONTINUING THEIR MANUFACTURE AS A REGULAR COMMODITY
MRS VANDERBILT BECAME HYSTERICAL AND WANTED TO KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM
THIS HEAVY CONSTRUCTION MORE FAMILIAR NOWADAYS AND NOT UNLIKE THE SUPPORTING METAL STRUCTURE OF THE MANHATTAN ELEVATED ROAD WAS ERECTED INDEPENDENT OF THE ENCLOSING WALLS AND OCCUPIED THE FULL WIDTH OF 257 PEARL STREET AND ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF ITS DEPTH

INASMUCH HOWEVER AS THERE IS NOTHING TO HINDER CURRENT WOULD FLOW FROM BATTERY C THROUGH WIRE B AND THE BAR WOULD THEREFORE BE MAGNETIZED
BUT IT WAS ALL HELPFUL AND SUGGESTIVE TO ONE WHOSE OPEN MIND REFUSED NO HINT FROM ANY QUARTER

HE WAS NOT FAR FROM STARVING

HOW DIFFERENT THE VIEW OF SO EMINENT A SCIENTIST AS LORD KELVIN WAS MAY BE APPRECIATED FROM HIS REMARK WHEN IN LATER YEARS IN REPLY TO THE QUESTION WHY SOME ONE ELSE DID NOT INVENT SO OBVIOUS AND SIMPLE A THING AS THE FEEDER SYSTEM HE SAID
THE RECEIVING STATIONS ALONG THE LINE OF THE RAILWAY WERE SIMILARLY EQUIPPED AS TO APPARATUS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING THE OPERATIONS OF SENDING AND RECEIVING MESSAGES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS ABOVE DESCRIBED

IT WAS THIS EXPERT AND THIS COMPANY WHO PIONEERED HIGH-CONDUCTIVITY COPPER FOR THE ELECTRICAL TRADE NOR IS IT GENERALLY APPRECIATED IN THE INDUSTRY THAT THE ADOPTION OF WHAT IS NOW REGARDED AS A MOST OBVIOUS PROPOSITION--THE HIGH-ECONOMY INCANDESCENT LAMP--WAS THE RESULT OF THAT CHARACTERISTIC FORESIGHT WHICH THERE HAS BEEN OCCASION TO MENTION FREQUENTLY IN THE COURSE OF THIS NARRATIVE TOGETHER WITH THE COURAGE AND HORSE-SENSE WHICH HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DISPLAYED BY THE INVENTOR IN HIS PERSISTENT PUSHING OUT WITH FAR-REACHING IDEAS IN THE FACE OF PESSIMISTIC OPINIONS
THIS IT WILL BE SEEN IS PARTLY EXPLAINED BY HIS WORK FOR YEARS AS A PRESS REPORTER
THE POWER STATION WAS PLACED AT THE CENTRE OF THE SQUARE
THUS A NEW ENTERPRISE MAY BE PRESENTED BEFORE THE WORLD BY ITS PROMOTERS IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY ARE STRONGLY FORTIFIED BY PATENT RIGHTS WHICH WILL PROTECT THEM IN A DEGREE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISKS THEY HAVE ASSUMED
IF ONE WERE ALLOWED ONLY TWO WORDS WITH WHICH TO DESCRIBE EDISON IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF THE ENTIRE DICTIONARY WOULD DISCLOSE ANY OTHERS MORE SUITABLE THAN EXPERIMENTER--INVENTOR THESE WOULD EXPRESS THE OVERRULING CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS EVENTFUL CAREER
EACH MAN WAS ALLOWED FROM FOUR TO SIX HOURS SLEEP
HE THUS BECAME A MANUFACTURER WITH CAPITAL RAISED BY HIMSELF AND THE STOCK THAT HE RECEIVED LATER ON THE FORMATION OF THE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY WAS NOT FOR HIS ELECTRIC-LIGHT PATENTS BUT WAS IN PAYMENT FOR HIS MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENTS WHICH HAD THEN GROWN TO BE OF GREAT COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE EARLY DAYS I WAS EXPERIMENTING WITH METALLIC FILAMENTS FOR THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT AND SENT A CERTAIN MAN OUT TO CALIFORNIA IN SEARCH OF PLATINUM
DURING HIS ROUNDS IN THE NIGHT SWANSON WOULD FIND TIME TO COLLECT FROM THE CHIMNEYS THE SOOT THAT THE LAMPS GAVE
SELL OUT WHAT WHY I SAID MY INTEREST IN THE MACHINERY THEY SAID

THE RESULTS OF THIS TRIAL WERE EXCEEDINGLY SUCCESSFUL FAR BETTER THAN WITH ANYTHING ELSE THUS FAR USED
EDISON HIMSELF KNEW NOTHING OF DUCOS OR THAT THE SUGGESTIONS HAD ADVANCED BEYOND THE SINGLE CENTRALLY LOCATED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MUYBRIDGE AND MAREY
WE CAN READILY SEE HOW THESE CHANGES IN POLARITY WILL OPERATE THE POLAR RELAY AT THE DISTANT STATION BUT WHY WILL THEY NOT ALSO OPERATE THE NEUTRAL RELAY AT THE DISTANT STATION AS WELL
A SMALL PLANT USING THE PAPER-CARBON FILAMENT LAMPS WAS FURNISHED BY EDISON AT THE EARNEST SOLICITATION OF MR HENRY VILLARD FOR THE STEAMSHIP COLUMBIA IN 1879 AND IT IS AMUSING TO NOTE THAT MR UPTON CARRIED THE LAMPS HIMSELF TO THE SHIP VERY TENDERLY AND JEALOUSLY LIKE FRESH EGGS IN A MARKET-GARDEN BASKET
IN THE PROSPECTUS BOOK AMONG THE SERIES OF FAMOUS NOTE-BOOKS ALL THE REFERENCES AND DATA APPLY TO GAS
AND THIS IN ITS TURN HAVING GONE TEN REVOLUTIONS ADVANCED THE NEXT WHEEL AND SO ON
MANY A NIGHT IT IS A QUESTION OF GETTING EDISON TO BED FOR HE WOULD MUCH RATHER PROBE A PROBLEM THAN EAT OR SLEEP
THE FINANCIAL HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF THE WORLD AS SHOWN BY THE PRICES OF GOVERNMENT BONDS AND GENERAL SECURITIES HAS BEEN TOLD DAILY FOR FORTY YEARS ON THESE NARROW STRIPS OF PAPER TAPE OF WHICH THOUSANDS OF MILES ARE RUN YEARLY THROUGH THE TICKERS OF NEW YORK ALONE
THEN WE DISCHARGED THE OFFICE-BOY

IN REALITY THEY WERE TOO FEW FOR THE DEMANDS THAT REACHED EDISON FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF HIS SYSTEM
FOR THIS ONE BOY WAS WHIPPED
HOWEVER I KEPT THIS UP FOR A LONG TIME AND IN ADDITION BOUGHT BUTTER FROM THE FARMERS ALONG THE LINE AND AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF BLACKBERRIES IN THE SEASON
THE CONGRATULATIONS OF THE PRESIDENTS OF SEVERAL NATIONAL ELECTRIC BODIES AND A NUMBER OF VOCAL AND INSTRUMENTAL SELECTIONS OF OPERATIC NATURE
ANGER WITH HIM HOWEVER IS A GOOD DEAL LIKE THE STORY ATTRIBUTED TO NAPOLEON
THE SEQUEL SHOWED THE VALUE OF EDISON'S CAUTIOUS METHOD IN STARTING THE STATION BY OPERATING ONLY A SINGLE UNIT AT FIRST
BUT CONSIDERING THE SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED HIS METHODS WILL BE ACCEPTED AS THOSE ECONOMICALLY WISE AND EXPEDIENT A CURSORY GLANCE AT THESE PROBLEMS WILL REVEAL THEIR IMPORT

FOR PICTURESQUE DETAIL IT WOULD NOT BE EASY TO FIND ANY STORY EXCELLING THAT OF THE EDISON FAMILY BEFORE IT REACHED THE WESTERN RESERVE
FOR A LONG TIME SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WAS TRICKERY
SUCH A MOTOR WAS DESIGNED AND IS NOW USED ON ALL PHONOGRAPHS EXCEPT ON SUCH SPECIAL INSTRUMENTS AS MAY BE MADE WITH ELECTRIC MOTORS AS WELL AS ON THE SUCCESSFUL APPARATUS THAT HAS MORE RECENTLY BEEN DESIGNED AND INTRODUCED FOR STENOGRAPHIC USE
THE PROCESS IS HEROIC BUT COSTLY
AND THE COMPETITION OF OIL FROM THE GROUND WITH OIL FROM THE SEA AND WITH COAL-GAS HAD MADE THE ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION OF LIGHT CHEAPER THAN EVER BEFORE WHEN UP TO THE MIDDLE OF THE CENTURY IT HAD REMAINED ONE OF THE HEAVIEST ITEMS OF DOMESTIC EXPENSE
AS A PURELY MANUFACTURING BUSINESS THE GENERAL CEMENT INDUSTRY IS ONE OF EVEN REMOTE ANTIQUITY AND IF EDISON HAD ENTERED INTO IT MERELY AS A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE BY FOLLOWING PATHS ALREADY SO WELL TRODDEN THE FACT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF EVEN PASSING NOTICE
I THINK HE WAS POSSIBLY DISAPPOINTED AT MY BEING SO YOUNG A MAN

I WELL REMEMBER HOW GREATLY HE WAS PLEASED IN SPEAKING OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEGATIVE ELEMENT OF THE BATTERY MR AYLSWORTH SAID
THE RESULT IS I HAVE NEVER ENJOYED ANY BENEFITS FROM MY LAMP PATENTS ALTHOUGH I FOUGHT FOR MANY YEARS THE GOEBEL CASE WILL BE REFERRED TO LATER IN THIS CHAPTER

I WENT ON THE STAGE SAID SOMETHING AND WE DID SOME TELEGRAPHING OVER THE LINE

WHEN THE CIRCUS COMMENCED THE GANG THAT WAS STANDING AROUND RAN OUT PRECIPITATELY AND I GUESS SOME OF THEM KEPT RUNNING FOR A BLOCK OR TWO
AMONG THEM WAS ONE WHICH WAS ISSUED SOME YEARS AFTERWARD AS PATENT NO
IT WAS A SMALL PART OF THIS VERY THING
HERE KRUESI WE DON'T WANT YOU TO COME TO THESE MEETINGS ANY LONGER
HUNDREDS OF PIECES ARE NECESSARY FOR THE COMPLETE SET
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS WERE SPENT PLEASANTLY AND PROFITABLY BY THE YOUTH IN THIS COURSE OF STUDY AND EDISON TOOK TO IT ENTHUSIASTICALLY GIVING IT NO LESS THAN EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY
TO WHICH THE CUSTOMERS REPLIED THAT THEY WERE ENTIRELY SATISFIED AND READY AND WILLING TO PAY FOR MORE BATTERIES OF THE SAME KIND

A FEW YEARS LATER CAME THE CONSOLIDATION WITH THE THOMSON-HOUSTON INTERESTS IN THE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY WHICH UNDER THE BRILLIANT AND VIGOROUS MANAGEMENT OF PRESIDENT C
TO-DAY THE PLACE AND REGION HAVE GONE BACK TO THE INSIGNIFICANCE FROM WHICH EDISON'S GENIUS LIFTED THEM SO STARTLINGLY

MANY PEOPLE NOW CHARGE THEIR OWN BATTERIES BECAUSE OF LACK OF FACILITIES
IT WILL BE NOTED THAT THERE ARE REALLY TWO SETS OF MOLDS AN INSIDE AND AN OUTSIDE SET LEAVING A SPACE BETWEEN THEM THROUGHOUT
IMPROVEMENT OF THE LAMP WAS CONSTANTLY IN HIS MIND ALL THOSE YEARS AND BESIDES THE VAST AMOUNT OF DETAIL EXPERIMENTAL WORK HE LAID OUT FOR HIS ASSISTANTS HE CARRIED ON A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH PERSONALLY
CONSEQUENTLY WITH THE EARLY TYPES OF COMMERCIAL PHONOGRAPHS IT WAS FIRST NECESSARY TO SHAVE OFF THE BLANK ACCURATELY BEFORE A RECORD WAS FORMED THEREON IN ORDER THAT AN ABSOLUTELY TRUE SURFACE MIGHT BE PRESENTED

ON MONDAY SEPTEMBER 4 1882 AT 3 O'CLOCK P.M EDISON REALIZED THE CONSUMMATION OF HIS BROAD AND ORIGINAL SCHEME
I SAW A LARGE NUMBER OF PERSONS BEING INOCULATED AND ALSO THE WHOLE MODUS OPERANDI WHICH WAS VERY INTERESTING
THE MOST AVAILABLE MEN FOR THE PURPOSE WERE OF COURSE THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO WIRING FOR THE SIMPLER ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS THEN IN VOGUE--TELEPHONES DISTRICT-MESSENGER CALLS BURGLAR ALARMS HOUSE ANNUNCIATORS ETC AND A NUMBER OF THESE WIREMEN WERE ENGAGED AND INSTRUCTED PATIENTLY IN THE RUDIMENTS OF THE NEW ART BY MEANS OF A BLACKBOARD AND ORAL LESSONS

THE CONTROVERSY THAT ONCE WAGED WITH GREAT EXCITEMENT OVER THE INVENTION OF THE MICROPHONE BUT HAS LONG SINCE DIED AWAY IS SUGGESTIVE OF THE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN TRYING TO DO JUSTICE TO EVERYBODY
CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS A CONSTANT ENDEAVOR ON THE PART OF A COUNTLESS HOST OF MEN POSSESSING SOME DEGREE OF TECHNICAL SKILL AND INVENTIVE ABILITY TO WIN FAME AND MONEY BY ENTERING INTO THE ALREADY OPENED FIELDS OF ENDEAVOR WITH DEVICES AND METHODS OF THEIR OWN FOR WHICH SUBSIDIARY PATENTS MAY BE OBTAINABLE

GO AND SEE THE PRESIDENT OF THE BANK WHICH PAID THE FORGED CHECKS
TO READ SOME NEW YORK LAW REPORTS
LARGE INTERESTS WERE AT STAKE AND THE MAIN DEFENCE TO THE EDISON PATENT WAS BASED ON PRIOR INVENTIONS
THUS WE FIND NUMEROUS INSTANCES THROUGHOUT THE LAST CENTURY OF EXPERIMENTS ALONG THIS LINE
BUT THEY OPERATE UNDER A SYSTEM OF PROCEDURE THAT STIFLES ABSOLUTELY THE DEVELOPMENT OF INVENTIVE GENIUS
THE TORPEDO IS CONTROLLED FROM THE SHORE OR SHIP THROUGH AN ELECTRIC CABLE WHICH IT PAYS OUT AS IT GOES ALONG AND ALL OPERATIONS OF VARYING THE SPEED REVERSING AND STEERING ARE PERFORMED AT THE WILL OF THE DISTANT OPERATOR BY MEANS OF CURRENTS SENT THROUGH THE CABLE
CLARKE LABORATORY ASSISTANT AT MENLO PARK 1880-81
OF ONE EXPERIENCE HE SAYS
UNTIL THAT SYSTEM IS CHANGED AND AN OPPORTUNITY OFFERED FOR A FINAL SWIFT AND ECONOMICAL ADJUDICATION OF PATENT RIGHTS AMERICAN INVENTORS MAY WELL HESITATE BEFORE OPENLY DISCLOSING THEIR INVENTIONS TO THE PUBLIC AND MAY SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE ADVISABILITY OF RETAINING THEM AS TRADE SECRETS CHAPTER XXIX THE SOCIAL SIDE OF EDISON THE TITLE OF THIS CHAPTER MIGHT IMPLY THAT THERE IS AN UNSOCIAL SIDE TO EDISON

SUCH A CONVERSION IS CALLED WORK AS DISTINGUISHED FROM DROP ALTHOUGH A FALL OF INITIAL ELECTRICAL PRESSURE IS INVOLVED IN EACH CASE
IT WAS OCCASIONALLY WORTH THE PROFIT TO CONVINCE A MAN THAT HE DID NOT ACTUALLY OWN THE MACHINE WHICH HAD BEEN PLACED IN HIS OFFICE
I KNEW IT TO BE RICH IN MANY VARIETIES OF THE BAMBOO FAMILY WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED THE KING OF THE GRASSES
THE WORKS SOLD FOR $1,085,000 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEMS BROUGHT TO EDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AN IMPORTER IN THE CHINESE TRADE WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER
OF COURSE HE FELL IN THE CANAL AND WAS NEARLY DROWNED
BUT THEY OCCUR RARELY THERE IS A CALM SENSE OF DETACHMENT ABOUT THIS DESCRIPTION THAT HAS BEEN POSSESSED BY THE NARRATOR EVEN IN THE MOST ANXIOUS MOMENTS OF HIS CAREER
I FOUND THAT THE COVER OF THE MANHOLE WEIGHING ABOUT 200 POUNDS HAD ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED BUT EVERYTHING INSIDE WAS INTACT
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO ART BUT THERE HAD BEEN A NUMBER OF SPORADIC AND VERY INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS MADE
AN IRON BAR WAS ALSO USED POLISHED AND WITH A MAN STANDING ON IT TO INSURE SOLID CONTACT
THE NEXT STEP WAS TO USE A NUMBER OF RESISTANCE-BOXES IN SERIES WITH THE ARMATURE SO THAT THE LOCOMOTIVE COULD START WITH THOSE IN CIRCUIT AND THEN THE MOTORMAN COULD BRING IT UP TO SPEED GRADUALLY BY CUTTING ONE BOX OUT AFTER THE OTHER
HIS SERVICES WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS GROW LESS VALUABLE AS HE ADVANCES IN AGE AND NERVOUS STRAIN BREAKS HIM DOWN

I NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT MUCH OF THIS NOISE AND CONFUSION MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH AND THAT THE PRICES MIGHT BE FURNISHED THROUGH SOME SYSTEM OF TELEGRAPHY WHICH WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE EMPLOYMENT OF SKILLED OPERATORS
MOREOVER AND WHAT WAS THE HEAVIEST BLOW OF ALL HE HAD TIME THUS UNMOLESTED TO GET A GOOD START
THESE RESULTS ACCOUNT FOR THE ENORMOUS TEMPERATURE OF THE ELECTRIC ARC WITH ONE HORSE-POWER
HE KNEW THAT HE HAD REACHED THE GOAL
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT ALL THE CAVEATS ARE NOT QUITE SO FULL OF PLUMS BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY A WONDER
BUT HE IS ONLY INTENSELY IN EARNEST IN PRESENTING HIS OWN SIDE
AFTER LEAVING MY FIRST JOB AT STRATFORD JUNCTION I GOT A POSITION AS OPERATOR ON THE LAKE SHORE MICHIGAN SOUTHERN AT ADRIAN MICHIGAN IN THE DIVISION SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD FIND BEARING UPON THE COUNTER ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE OF THE ARMATURE AND THE EFFECT OF THE RESISTANCE OF THE ARMATURE ON THE WORK GIVEN OUT BY THE ARMATURE
A VERY BRIEF EXAMINATION INTO THEIR MERITS HOWEVER SUFFICED TO DEMONSTRATE MOST EMPHATICALLY THAT GOEBEL HAD NEVER MADE A PRACTICAL INCANDESCENT LAMP NOR HAD HE EVER CONTRIBUTED A SINGLE IDEA OR DEVICE BEARING REMOTELY OR DIRECTLY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ART
THEN YOU COME ALONG AND ABOUT THE FIRST THING YOU DO AFTER LOOKING THE GROUND OVER IS TO START OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY PROVES TO BE THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY TO REACH THE GOAL
A VERY BAD STORM CAME UP ABOUT 10 O'CLOCK AND MY WIRE WORKED VERY BADLY

FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS EDISON WAS AVOWEDLY AN INVENTOR FOR PURELY COMMERCIAL PURPOSES
LITTLE IS KNOWN OF THE EARLY MANHOOD OF THIS FATHER OF T
INDEED FAR FROM OTHERWISE FOR IN THE TEN YEARS THAT HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE TIME HE SET HIMSELF AND HIS MECHANICS CHEMISTS MACHINISTS AND EXPERIMENTERS AT WORK TO DEVELOP A PRACTICAL COMMERCIAL CELL THE OLD STORY OF INCESSANT AND PERSISTENT EFFORTS SO MANIFEST IN THE WORKING OUT OF OTHER INVENTIONS WAS FULLY REPEATED
BUT TO MENTION THESE INVENTIONS SEPARATELY WOULD TRESPASS TOO MUCH ON OUR LIMITED SPACE HERE

ALWAYS STRENUOUS IN HIS EXPERIMENTATION AND THE LIVING EMBODIMENT OF THE SPIRIT OF THE SONG I WANT WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT IT EDISON HAD KNOWN FOR YEARS WHAT IT WAS TO BE OBLIGED TO WAIT AND SOMETIMES LACK FOR SOME SUBSTANCE OR CHEMICAL THAT HE THOUGHT NECESSARY TO THE SUCCESS OF AN EXPERIMENT
AND THE SAME SWIFT ALMOST HEADLONG TRIAL OF ANYTHING THAT COMES TO HAND WHILE THE FERVOR OF A NEW EXPERIMENT IS FELT HAS BEEN NOTED AT ALL STAGES OF THE INVENTOR'S CAREER
SAME CHARACTER AS IMPINGEMENT OF X-RAYS ON OBJECT IN BULB
HE WAS PROUD OF HIS INCANDESCENT LAMPS AND WAS PLEASED TO TALK ABOUT THEM WITH ANYBODY WHO WOULD LISTEN

THIS MAN HAD A LENGTH OF INSULATED NO
THE FIRST THREE MONTHS I HAD HIM GO OVER THE BOOKS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH WE HAD MADE
BY A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE ANOTHER OF THE MEN HAD BEEN STABBED IN A KENO-ROOM AND WAS ALSO IN HOSPITAL WHILE THE THIRD OPERATOR HAD GONE TO CYNTHIANA TO SEE A MAN HANGED AND HAD GOT LEFT BY THE TRAIN I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT LINE OF INVESTIGATION IS THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY DIRECT FROM CARBON
THAT ARTICLES WITH EDISON'S NAME AS AUTHOR HAVE BEEN WIDELY CIRCULATED ALTHOUGH HE NEVER SAW THEM
AFTER THE SUPPER-HOUR WAS OVER HOWEVER HE AGAIN BECAME THE SERIOUS ENERGETIC INVENTOR DEEPLY IMMERSED IN THE WORK AT HAND
A SIREN WORKED BY EXPLOSION OF SMALL QUANTITIES OF OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN MIXED
IT SEEMS ALMOST INCREDIBLE THAT ONLY A LITTLE OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO THE SUM OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IN REGARD TO DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINES WAS SO MEAGRE THAT THE EXPERTS OF THE PERIOD SHOULD SETTLE UPON SUCH A DICTUM AS THIS BUT SUCH WAS THE FACT AS WILL PRESENTLY APPEAR
OSMIUM FROM A VOLATILE COMPOUND OF SAME THUS DEPOSITED MAKES A FILAMENT AS GOOD AS CARBON WHEN IN VACUO IN 1888 LONG BEFORE THERE AROSE THE ACTUAL NECESSITY OF DUPLICATING PHONOGRAPH RECORDS SO AS TO PRODUCE REPLICAS IN GREAT NUMBERS EDISON DESCRIBED IN ONE OF HIS CAVEATS A METHOD AND PROCESS MUCH SIMILAR TO THE ONE WHICH WAS PUT INTO PRACTICE BY HIM IN LATER YEARS
HE WAS VERY THIN AND SMALL
EDISON'S ELECTRIC RAILWAY AS NARRATED IN CHAPTER XVIII THERE WERE TWO ELECTRIC RAILROADS INSTALLED BY EDISON AT MENLO PARK--ONE IN 1880 ORIGINALLY A THIRD OF A MILE LONG BUT SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASED TO ABOUT A MILE IN LENGTH AND THE OTHER IN 1882 ABOUT THREE MILES LONG
THAT SUCH A VIEW OF HIS WORK IS CORRECT THE HIGHEST CRITERION--COMMERCIAL EXPEDIENCY--BEARS WITNESS
IT WILL BE SEEN FROM THIS SKETCH THAT THERE ARE TEN LAMPS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AND TWELVE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE
BY THUS MANIPULATING THE VARIOUS SOLVENTS YOU WILL BE ENABLED PROBABLY TO SEPARATE THE CRUDE ASPHALT INTO SEVERAL DISTINCT HYDROCARBONS

I BELIEVE THAT THIS CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT WAS UNKINDLY NAMED THE DESTRUCTION DEPARTMENT IT SERVED ITS PURPOSE
GAS HAD BECOME FAMILIAR AS A MEANS OF ILLUMINATION IN LARGE CITIES
FINALLY JUST AS A FAINT GLEAM OF DAYLIGHT ARRIVED WE ENTERED THE CAPTAIN'S YARD AND DELIVERED THE MESSAGE
IT WAS OUR CUSTOM TO LEAVE ORANGE ABOUT 11 A.M AND ON ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK TO GET OUR LUNCH BEFORE KEEPING THE APPOINTMENTS WHICH WERE USUALLY MADE FOR TWO O'CLOCK

ONE OF THESE SAMPLES TESTED OUT POORER THAN A PREVIOUS LOT FURNISHED FROM THE SAME FACTORY
THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE SOCIAL LIFE OF ANY KIND POSSIBLE UNDER THE STRENUOUS CONDITIONS PREVAILING AT THE LABORATORY WHERE IF ANYWHERE RELAXATION WAS ENJOYED AT ODD INTERVALS OF FATIGUE AND WAITING
THE ELECTROMOTOGRAPH IN SOLVING A PROBLEM THAT AT THE TIME WAS THOUGHT TO BE INSURMOUNTABLE AND IN THE ADAPTABILITY OF ITS PRINCIPLES TO THE SUCCESSFUL OVERCOMING OF APPARENTLY INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTIES SUBSEQUENTLY ARISING IN OTHER LINES OF WORK THIS INVENTION IS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE OF THE MANY THAT EDISON HAS MADE IN HIS LONG CAREER AS AN INVENTOR
INCIDENTALLY A NOTE REMARKS
EATON THE LEADING MEMBER OF A VERY PROMINENT LAW FIRM IN NEW YORK TO ACCEPT THE POSITION OF VICE-PRESIDENT AND GENERAL MANAGER OF THE COMPANY IN WHICH AS ALSO IN SOME OF THE SUBSIDIARY EDISON COMPANIES AND AS PRESIDENT HE CONTINUED ACTIVELY AND ENERGETICALLY FOR NEARLY FOUR YEARS A CRITICAL FORMATIVE PERIOD IN WHICH THE SOLIDITY OF THE FOUNDATION LAID IS ATTESTED BY THE MAGNITUDE AND SPLENDOR OF THE SUPERSTRUCTURE
I CAN WELL RECALL WHEN EDISON DRIFTED IN TO TAKE A JOB
IT WOULD PERHAPS BE INTERESTING TO SPECULATE UPON WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE GROWTH OF THE TELEGRAPH AND THE RESULTANT BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY HAD EDISON'S AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH INVENTIONS BEEN ALLOWED TO TAKE THEIR LEGITIMATE PLACE IN THE ART BUT WE SHALL NOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO INDULGE IN FLIGHTS OF FANCY AS THE VALUE OF THIS CHAPTER RESTS NOT UPON CONJECTURE BUT ONLY UPON ACTUAL FACT

IN MAY 1889 AT A MEETING OF THE INSTITUTION OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS IN LONDON DR NOW SIR OLIVER LODGE REMARKED IN A DISCUSSION ON A PAPER OF HIS OWN ON LIGHTNING CONDUCTORS EMBRACING THE HERTZIAN WAVES IN ITS TREATMENT
SOMMERS WAS A VERY WITTY MAN HE SAYS AND FOND OF EXPERIMENTING
ONE DAY I GOT HOLD OF BOTH ELECTRODES OF THE COIL AND IT CLINCHED MY HAND ON THEM SO THAT I COULDN'T LET GO
IN JUNE 1879 WAS PUBLISHED THE ACCOUNT OF THE EDISON DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINE THAT SURVIVED IN THE ART
FARADAY HAD A POWERFUL MACHINE WORKING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD GIVING ALL VARIETIES OF GRADUAL WORKING-UP AND DISCHARGES BY IMPULSIVE RUSH
IN 1909 I GOT BACK $6.40 WITH A CHARGE FOR $1.75 FOR LAW EXPENSES
THESE ENTERPRISES ARE THE NATIONAL PHONOGRAPH COMPANY THE EDISON BUSINESS PHONOGRAPH COMPANY THE EDISON PHONOGRAPH WORKS THE EDISON MANUFACTURING COMPANY THE EDISON STORAGE BATTERY COMPANY AND THE BATES MANUFACTURING COMPANY
EDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST-TUBE AND GALVANOMETER
THE NOISES WERE SO GREAT THAT NOT A WORD COULD BE HEARD WITH THE BELL RECEIVER WHEN USED AS A TRANSMITTER BETWEEN NEW YORK AND NEWARK NEW JERSEY
SLAPPING HIS HANDS DELIGHTEDLY ON HIS KNEES HE ROCKS BACK AND FORTH AND FAIRLY SHOUTS HIS PLEASURE
HAID HAD CHARGE OF NEXT TO THE LABORATORY IN IMPORTANCE WAS THE MACHINE-SHOP A LARGE AND WELL-LIGHTED BUILDING OF BRICK AT ONE END OF WHICH THERE WAS THE BOILER AND ENGINE-ROOM

ALL THE OTHER ENGINEERING PROBLEMS HAVE RECEIVED STUDY IN LIKE MANNER AND HAVE BEEN OVERCOME UNTIL AT THE PRESENT WRITING THE WHOLE QUESTION IS PRACTICALLY SOLVED AND HAS BEEN REDUCED TO ACTUAL PRACTICE
SO THAT A HUMAN MOUTH USES A PEN AND INSCRIBES ITS SIGN VOCAL
NOT SO HOWEVER
IT WAS BUT A SHORT TIME THEREAFTER THAT HE SOLVED THE KNOTTY PROBLEM BY AN INVENTION MENTIONED IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER
BUT AS WE ARE CONSIDERING SYSTEMS OF EXTENDED DISTRIBUTION EMPLOYING VAST NUMBERS OF LAMPS AS IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE MILLIONS ARE IN USE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT SUCH A METHOD WOULD LEAD TO INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION AND THEREFORE BE ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION

EVERYBODY TITTERED AND I WAS TOLD THAT MR CONKLING WAS DISPLEASED

IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT AS THE EARLIER STAFF BROKE UP EDISON BECAME THE CENTRE OF ANOTHER LARGE BODY EQUALLY DEVOTED BUT MORE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF HIS IDEAS
THE ELECTRICAL WORK HAD TO BE DONE IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS
THERE NEVER WAS A MONOPOLY IN THE PHONOGRAPH
I PULLED OFF MY COAT SHOES AND HAT AND LAID THEM ON THE CHEST
ONE EXAMPLE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO CONVEY TO THE READER AN IDEA OF THE OPERATION OF THE APPARATUS
FINALLY I GOT POSSESSION OF THE WIRE AND SENT THE MESSAGE
BELL INVENTED THE FIRST TELEPHONE WHICH CONSISTED OF THE PRESENT RECEIVER USED BOTH AS A TRANSMITTER AND A RECEIVER THE MAGNETO TYPE IT WAS ATTEMPTED TO INTRODUCE IT COMMERCIALLY BUT IT FAILED ON ACCOUNT OF ITS FAINTNESS AND THE EXTRANEOUS SOUNDS WHICH CAME IN ON ITS WIRES FROM VARIOUS CAUSES
THIS WAS NOT A NEW SUGGESTION BECAUSE I HAD MADE A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS ON ELECTRIC LIGHTING A YEAR BEFORE THIS
INDEED IT IS IN TWO PARTS THE ONE CONTAINING THE LIGHTING ARRANGEMENTS AND CONDENSING LENS AND THE OTHER EMBRACING THE MECHANISM AND OBJECTIVE LENS
AND IN DEVELOPING THIS INVENTION TO A SUCCESSFUL ISSUE HAD PREFERRED THE USE OF CARBON AND HAD EMPLOYED IT IN NUMEROUS FORMS ESPECIALLY IN THE FORM OF CARBONIZED PAPER
DIXEY THEN AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS ADONIS POPULARITY WOULD COME IN IN THOSE DAYS AFTER THEATRE HOURS AND WOULD ENTERTAIN US WITH STORIES--1882-84
I ALSO HAD AN ORGAN WHICH I PROCURED FROM HILBOURNE ROOSEVELT--UNCLE OF THE EX-PRESIDENT--AND WE HAD A MAN PLAY THIS ORGAN WHILE WE ATE OUR LUNCH
THE BEST LAID PLANS O MICE AND MEN GANG AFT AGLEY THE DISCOVERY OF GREAT DEPOSITS OF RICH BESSEMER ORE IN THE MESABA RANGE OF MOUNTAINS IN MINNESOTA A YEAR OR TWO PREVIOUS TO THE COMPLETION OF HIS WORK HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY THE OPENING UP OF THOSE DEPOSITS AND THE MARKETING OF THE ORE
WE TESTED WHAT WE CONSIDERED A VERY SMALL QUANTITY BUT THIS PRODUCED SUCH TERRIBLE AND UNEXPECTED RESULTS THAT WE BECAME ALARMED THE FACT DAWNING UPON US THAT WE HAD A VERY LARGE WHITE ELEPHANT IN OUR POSSESSION
EDISON'S NEW STORAGE BATTERY GENERICALLY CONSIDERED A BATTERY IS A DEVICE WHICH GENERATES ELECTRIC CURRENT
WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT THE BASIC PATENT OF EDISON ON THE PHONOGRAPH HAS LONG SINCE EXPIRED THUS THROWING OPEN TO THE WORLD THE WONDERFUL ART OF REPRODUCING HUMAN SPEECH AND OTHER SOUNDS
WHEN THESE FIBRES ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES THEY WERE CAREFULLY TESTED AND A FEW OF THEM FOUND SUITABLE BUT NOT SUPERIOR TO THE JAPANESE BAMBOO WHICH WAS THEN BEING EXCLUSIVELY USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF COMMERCIAL EDISON LAMPS
WHEN THE OPERATOR RELEASES THE PRESSURE ON HIS KEY THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN CURRENT DOES NOT FLOW THE MAGNETIC EFFECT CEASES AND THE ARMATURE IS DRAWN BACK BY ITS SPRING
THE THOUGHT OF LOSING ALL HIS POSSESSIONS WAS THE CAUSE OF SO MUCH ARDENT DISTRESS THAT HIS MOTHER RELENTED BUT INSISTED THAT HE MUST GET A LOCK AND KEY AND KEEP THE EMBRYONIC LABORATORY CLOSED UP ALL THE TIME EXCEPT WHEN HE WAS THERE
BY MEANS OF THE BRILLIANCY OF THE LAMPS MARINE ANIMALS IN THE LOWER DEPTHS WERE ATTRACTED AND THEN EASILY ENSNARED
BUT THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY OPEN EVEN TO THE HIGHEST TALENT
ALSO EVERY CONSUMER OF POWER AND THE QUANTITY USED
I TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO GET OFF WHAT SEEMED TO ME A FUNNY STORY BUT HE FAILED TO SEE ANY HUMOR IN THEM
IT IS STATED THAT THE INTERNAL RESISTANCE OF THE ARMATURE OF THIS MACHINE IS ONLY 1/2 OHM ON THIS FACT AND THE DISPROPORTION BETWEEN THIS RESISTANCE AND THAT OF THE EXTERNAL CIRCUIT THE THEORY OF THE ALLEGED EFFICIENCY OF THE MACHINE IS STATED TO BE BASED FOR WE ARE INFORMED THAT WHILE THIS GENERATOR IN GENERAL PRINCIPLE IS THE SAME AS IN THE BEST WELL-KNOWN FORMS STILL THERE IS AN ALL-IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE WHICH IS THAT IT WILL CONVERT AND DELIVER FOR USEFUL WORK NEARLY DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF FOOT-POUNDS THAT ANY OTHER MACHINE WILL UNDER LIKE CONDITIONS THE WRITER OF THIS CRITICAL LETTER THEN PROCEEDS TO QUOTE MR UPTON'S STATEMENT OF THIS EFFICIENCY
THE STORY OF ANY ONE YEAR IN THIS PERIOD IF TREATED CHRONOLOGICALLY WOULD BRANCH OFF IN A GREAT MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SOME GOING BACK TO EARLIER WORK OTHERS FORWARD TO ARTS NOT YET WITHIN THE GENERAL SURVEY
THE PLATEN HAD A SPIRAL GROOVE ON ITS SURFACE LIKE THE DISK
WE ALL KNOW HOW FARADAY MADE HIMSELF A CAGE SIX FEET IN DIAMETER HUNG IT UP IN MID-AIR IN THE THEATRE OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTION WENT INTO IT AND AS HE SAID LIVED IN IT AND MADE EXPERIMENTS

IF WE WANT TO KEEP THE MEN HERE WE MUST MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE FOR THE WOMEN--SO LET US BUILD SOME HOUSES THAT WILL HAVE RUNNING WATER AND ELECTRIC LIGHTS AND RENT AT A LOW RATE HE SET TO WORK AND IN A DAY FINISHED A DESIGN FOR A TYPE OF HOUSE
THIS WAS MY INTRODUCTION TO EDISON
MOTT WHO DEVOTED THEIR TIME CHIEFLY TO COMMERCIAL AFFAIRS
AT A MEETING OF THE INSTITUTION OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS HELD IN LONDON ON MAY 16 1889 AT WHICH THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ON THE CELEBRATED PAPER OF PROF SIR OLIVER LODGE ON LIGHTNING CONDUCTORS HOWEVER
HIS JUMBO MACHINES OF 175 HORSE-POWER SO ENORMOUS FOR THEIR TIME HAVE SERVED AS PROTOTYPES AND HAVE BEEN SUCCEEDED BY GENERATORS WHICH HAVE CONSTANTLY GROWN IN SIZE AND CAPACITY UNTIL AT THIS TIME 1910 IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO EMPLOY SUCH GENERATING UNITS OF A CAPACITY OF 14,000 KILOWATTS OR ABOUT 18,666 HORSE-POWER
BUT WITH THIS MACHINE SEVERAL HUNDRED WORDS WERE POSSIBLE
JUNE 11 1900 759,358 MAGNETIC SEPARATING APPARATUS
WHEN THE FIRST LAMP-WORKS WERE STARTED AT MENLO PARK ONE OF MY EXPERIMENTS SEEMED TO SHOW THAT HOT MERCURY GAVE A BETTER VACUUM IN THE LAMP THAN COLD MERCURY
UPON IT WAS MOUNTED A BROAD RATCHET-WHEEL WITH A CRANK WHILE INTO THE TEETH OF THE WHEEL THERE PLAYED A STOUT ELASTIC SLAB OF WOOD
THERE HE DID VERY WELL BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG AS IT ALWAYS DOES TO A NOMAD SO HE WENT TO THE TRANSVAAL AND RAN A PANORAMA CALLED PARADISE LOST IN THE KAFFIR KRAALS

IT CAN READILY BE CONCEIVED THAT AT SUCH AN EXTREME DISTANCE FROM THE SOURCE OF SUPPLY OF APPARATUS THE PLANT WAS SUBJECT TO MANY PECULIAR DIFFICULTIES FROM THE OUTSET OF WHICH MR STEWART SPEAKS AS FOLLOWS
WHEN HE DECIDES ON ANY MODE OF PROCEDURE HE GIVES HIS NOTES TO THE EXPERIMENTER AND LETS HIM ALONE ONLY STEPPING IN FROM TIME TO TIME TO LOOK AT THE OPERATIONS AND RECEIVE REPORTS OF PROGRESS THE HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TELEPHONE TRANSMITTER PHONOGRAPH INCANDESCENT LAMP DYNAMO ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTING SYSTEMS FROM CENTRAL STATIONS ELECTRIC RAILWAY ORE-MILLING CEMENT MOTION PICTURES AND A HOST OF MINOR INVENTIONS MAY BE FOUND EMBEDDED IN THE LABORATORY NOTE-BOOKS
LET US QUOTE ONE OR TWO PIQUANT PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS OF A MORE SPECIFIC NATURE AS TO THE ODD CHARACTERS EDISON DREW AROUND HIM IN HIS EXPERIMENTING
9 1890 457,343 MAGNETIC BELTING SEPT
LEAVING THE TELEPHONE LET US NOW TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE TELEGRAPH AND ENDEAVOR TO SHOW AS BEST WE CAN SOME IDEA OF THE MEASURE TO WHICH IT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY EDISON'S INVENTIONS
WE WENT TO THE TOP WHERE THERE WAS AN EXTENSION AND A SMALL PLACE IN WHICH WAS EIFFEL'S PRIVATE OFFICE
IN HIS AUTOMOBILE HE HAS MADE LONG TOURS AND WITH HIS FAMILY HAS PARTICULARLY INDULGED HIS TASTE FOR BOTANY
THE PASSENGERS DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THE TRANSACTION
COLOMBO AND HIS FRIENDS ORGANIZED THE ITALIAN EDISON COMPANY AND ERECTED AT MILAN THE FIRST CENTRAL STATION IN THAT COUNTRY
ONLY ONCE WAS I IN DANGER WHEN THE LOCOMOTIVE STRUCK AN ANIMAL ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL CUB BEAR--WHICH I THINK WAS A BADGER
WHILE EDISON WAS CARRYING ON HIS SHOP AT NEWARK NEW JERSEY THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT IN ELECTRICAL CIRCLES OVER THE PAYNE MOTOR IN REGARD TO THE ALLEGED PERFORMANCE OF WHICH GOVERNOR CORNELL OF NEW YORK AND OTHER WEALTHY CAPITALISTS WERE QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC
UNDER TEMPORARY RULINGS HOWEVER A VAST AMOUNT OF WORK HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE BUT IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT AS THE INDUSTRY GREW THERE WOULD BE LESS AND LESS POSSIBILITY OF SUPERVISION EXCEPT THROUGH SUCH REGULATIONS INSISTING UPON THE USE OF THE BEST DEVICES AND METHODS
THESE TWO MEN WERE FRANK MCGOWAN AND C
I HAD SEVERAL CAR-LOADS OF DIFFERENT PLACER SANDS SENT TO ME AND PROVED I COULD DO IT
THIS MINE ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS OF SEVERAL MINING ENGINEERS MADE IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE RICHEST PLACER DEPOSITS IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS SCHEMES HAD BEEN PUT FORWARD TO BRING WATER FROM THE MOUNTAINS FORTY MILES AWAY TO WORK THOSE IMMENSE BEDS
TO 12 PER CENT
HE HAS NEVER ASSUMED TO BE A PHILOSOPHER OR PURE SCIENTIST IN ORDER THAT THE READER MAY GRASP AN ADEQUATE IDEA OF THE MAGNITUDE AND IMPORTANCE OF EDISON'S INVENTION OF THE INCANDESCENT LAMP IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO REVIEW BRIEFLY THE STATE OF THE ART AT THE TIME HE BEGAN HIS EXPERIMENTS ON THAT LINE
THEY SHOW HIM TO BE A PLAIN EASY-GOING PLACID AMERICAN WITH NO SENSE OF SELF-IMPORTANCE AND READY AT ALL TIMES TO HAVE HIS MIND TURNED INTO A LIGHTER CHANNEL
3 1880 242,897 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP DEC
THAT NO PRACTICAL MACHINERY COULD BE BUILT TO STAND THE TERRIFIC IMPACT AND STRAINS
A MODIFICATION OF THIS WAS AFTERWARD USED ON THE FRENCH ATLANTIC LINES FOR MAKING AN ARTIFICIAL HORIZON TO TAKE OBSERVATIONS FOR POSITION AT SEA
BUT WHAT OF HIS POSITION IN THE AGE IN WHICH HE LIVES
TO ONE SO MECHANICAL IN HIS TASTES AS EDISON IT WAS QUITE EASY TO LEARN THE RUDIMENTS OF THE PRINTING ART AND THUS THE WEEKLY HERALD CAME INTO EXISTENCE OF WHICH HE WAS COMPOSITOR PRESSMAN EDITOR PUBLISHER AND NEWSDEALER
HE HAD BEEN BITTEN IN THE FACE AND WAS TAKING THE TREATMENT
I THEN CONCLUDED IT WOULD NOT DO AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE A VERY POPULAR KIND OF LIGHT
HE THEN WENT TO NEWARK AND SAT UP ALL NIGHT WITH THE MONEY FOR FEAR IT MIGHT BE STOLEN
MAGNETIC ORE MILLING WORK XX
THERE WERE OF COURSE ONLY FOUR PINS AT THE RECEIVING INSTRUMENT
THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED OUT AS SOON AS IT IS COMPLETED
MALLORY UNTIL FINALLY HE SAID TO THE LATTER
XXXII PAGES 409 AND 419 THE TELEGRAPHIC JOURNAL AND ELECTRICAL REVIEW LONDON VOL
THE EXPLORATION OF THE GLADES AND SWAMPS OF FLORIDA BY THREE MEN EXTENDED OVER A PERIOD OF FIVE MONTHS IN A MINUTE SEARCH FOR FIBROUS WOODS OF THE PALMETTO SPECIES
HENCE THE INCANDESCING CONDUCTORS IN ALL CARBON-FILAMENT LAMPS OF THE PRESENT DAY ARE MADE IN THAT WAY
THAT IS TO SAY LONG BEFORE A SINGLE SOUND WAS INTELLIGIBLY TRANSMITTED IT WAS RECOGNIZED THAT SUCH A THING MIGHT BE DONE BY CAUSING A DIAPHRAGM VIBRATED BY ORIGINAL SOUNDS TO COMMUNICATE ITS MOVEMENTS TO A DISTANT DIAPHRAGM BY A SUITABLY CONTROLLED ELECTRIC CURRENT
GENERAL GRANT IN HIS MEMOIRS DESCRIBING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC LAYS STRESS ON THE SERVICE OF HIS TELEGRAPH OPERATORS AND SAYS
HE SAID THAT SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO A SUIT WAS SENT TO HIM FROM ORANGE AND MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE FROM IT AND THAT EVERY SUIT SINCE HAD BEEN MADE FROM THESE MEASUREMENTS
CONFRONTED BY THE NECESSITY OF SENDING IN THIS WATCHMAN'S SIGNAL AS EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS AWAKE AND ON DUTY HE CONSTRUCTED A SMALL WHEEL WITH NOTCHES ON THE RIM AND ATTACHED IT TO THE CLOCK IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE NIGHT-WATCHMAN COULD START IT WHEN THE LINE WAS QUIET AND AT EACH HOUR THE WHEEL REVOLVED AND SENT IN ACCURATELY THE DOTS REQUIRED FOR SIXING THE INVENTION WAS A SUCCESS THE DEVICE BEING INDEED SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE MODERN DISTRICT MESSENGER BOX
IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS EXPERIMENTATION HE HAD MADE THE CONDITIONS OF TEST VERY SEVERE BY THE CONSTRUCTION OF FORMS SIMILAR TO THAT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH BELOW
THE DIAPHRAGM OF THE PHONOGRAPH MOUTHPIECE IS ACTUATED BY AN ELECTROMAGNET IN THE SAME WAY AS THAT OF AN ORDINARY TELEPHONE RECEIVER AND IN THIS MANNER A RECORD OF THE MESSAGE SPOKEN FROM A DISTANCE CAN BE OBTAINED AND TURNED INTO SOUND AT WILL
THE GIANT ROLLS WERE BELT-DRIVEN IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THROUGH FRICTION CLUTCHES ALTHOUGH THE BELT WAS NOT DEPENDED UPON FOR THE ACTUAL CRUSHING
THE IMPORTANT CHANGES MADE FROM THAT TIME UP TO 1890 CONVERTED THE PHONOGRAPH FROM A SCIENTIFIC TOY INTO A SUCCESSFUL INDUSTRIAL APPARATUS
MR INSULL WAS THEN MY BUSINESS MANAGER RUNNING THE WHOLE THING
THE STORY WAS MET BY THE EDISON INTERESTS WITH COUNTER-AFFIDAVITS SHOWING ITS UTTER IMPROBABILITIES AND ABSURDITIES FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MEN OF SCIENCE AND OTHERS VERSED IN THE HISTORY AND PRACTICE OF THE ART
19 1875 171,273 TELEGRAPH APPARATUS
PERHAPS QUARRYING WOULD BE A BETTER TERM THAN MINING IN THIS CASE AS EDISON'S PLAN WAS TO APPROACH THE ROCK AND TEAR IT DOWN BODILY
PRIDE
ABOUT 11 O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WORD WAS RECEIVED FROM PRESIDENT HAYES THAT HE WOULD BE VERY MUCH PLEASED IF I WOULD COME UP TO THE WHITE HOUSE
ELIMINATING ALL PURELY FORENSIC ELOQUENCE AND EXPARTE STATEMENTS THE ADDRESSES OF COUNSEL IN THIS CELEBRATED SUIT ARE WORTHY OF DEEP STUDY BY AN EARNEST STUDENT FOR TAKEN TOGETHER THEY COMPRISE THE MOST CONCISE AUTHENTIC AND COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE PRIOR STATE OF THE ART AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INCANDESCENT LAMP THAT HAD BEEN MADE UP TO THAT TIME
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHY HORSES SHOULD BE ALLOWED WITHIN CITY LIMITS
STANTON SAID THAT THE USUAL LIVE-STOCK ACCOMPANIMENT OF OPERATORS BOARDING-HOUSES WAS ABSENT
WHEN EDISON TAKES UP ANY PROPOSITION IN NATURAL SCIENCE HIS PERCEPTIONS SEEM TO BE ELEMENTALLY BROAD AND ANALYTICAL THAT IS TO SAY IN ADDITION TO THE KNOWLEDGE HE HAS ACQUIRED FROM BOOKS AND OBSERVATION HE APPEARS TO HAVE AN INTUITIVE APPREHENSION OF THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS AS THEY MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO EXIST IN NATURAL RELATION TO EACH OTHER

AND SO ON THROUGH THE ALPHABET
HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FELLOW
THE POLICY OF THE COMPANY IS TO DISPOSE OF ITS WARES THROUGH REGULAR TRADE CHANNELS RATHER THAN TO DEAL DIRECT WITH THE PUBLIC TRUSTING TO LOCAL ACTIVITY AS STIMULATED BY A LIBERAL POLICY OF NATIONAL ADVERTISING

THE BLOW BROKE THE GLASS CARBOY AND THE ACID RAN DOWN UPON THE FIELD MAGNETS OF THE DYNAMO DESTROYING THE WINDINGS OF ONE OF THE TWELVE MAGNETS
THE ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE HOWEVER TO INDICATE THE COURSE OF EVENTS AND DEAL FAIRLY WITH THE FACTS
BEFORE FINALLY DISMISSING THE QUADRUPLEX AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE INQUIRING READER WHO MAY VAINLY PUZZLE OVER THE INTRICACIES OF THE CIRCUITS SHOWN IN FIG
HE WAS A WONDERFUL MECHANIC
ONE DAY SOON AFTER HE WAS MISSING
HE SECURED THIS PRIVILEGE OF DISTRIBUTION AND RESIGNING FROM THE EXCHANGE DEVOTED HIS EXCLUSIVE ATTENTION TO THE GOLD REPORTING TELEGRAPH WHICH HE PATENTED AND FOR WHICH AT THE END OF 1866 HE HAD SECURED FIFTY SUBSCRIBERS
HE WAS THEN LESS THAN FOURTEEN YEARS OLD
AS HORSES RAN WILD AND THERE WAS NO PROTECTION IT MEANT DEATH TO STEAL ONE THIS WAS ONE INTERLUDE AMONG OTHERS
FOR A SIX-HOUR RUN OF THE PLANT ONE-QUARTER OF A CORD OF WOOD WAS REQUIRED AT A COST OF TWENTY-FIVE CENTS PER CORD
EDISON HAS BEEN SEEN SOMETIMES ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF WITH ANGER AT A STUPID MISTAKE OR INEXCUSABLE OVERSIGHT ON THE PART OF AN ASSISTANT HIS VOICE RAISED TO A HIGH PITCH SNEERINGLY EXPRESSING HIS FEELINGS OF CONTEMPT FOR THE OFFENDER
FIRST A STOLID ALMOST PHLEGMATIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH TAKES ABSOLUTELY NO NOTICE OF ENNUI--A SYSTEM LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE IVORY-CARVER WHO WORKS DAY AFTER DAY AND MONTH AFTER MONTH ON A PIECE OF MATERIAL NO LARGER THAN YOUR HAND

AND ONLY ONCE DID I HEAR HIM MAKE ANY REFERENCE TO THE FINANCIAL LOSS WHICH HE HIMSELF MADE AND HE THEN SAID
WHEN SO ARRANGED A MOISTENED PIECE OF PAPER HELD SEVERAL FEET AWAY WILL CAUSE A MINUTE EXPANSION OF THE GELATINE STRIP WHICH EFFECTS A PRESSURE ON THE CARBON AND CAUSES A VARIATION IN THE CIRCUIT SUFFICIENT TO THROW THE SPOT OF LIGHT FROM THE GALVANOMETER MIRROR OFF THE SCALE
THE JURY OF AWARDS IN PRESENTING FOUR MEDALS TO THE EDISON COMPANY TOOK OCCASION TO PAY A HIGH COMPLIMENT TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM
SO FAR LITTLE HAD COME OF X-RAY WORK BUT IT ADDED ANOTHER LETTER TO THE SCIENTIFIC ALPHABET
TOWARD ITS LIGHT-BRINGERS THE RACE HAS ASSUMED AN ATTITUDE OF VENERATION THOUGH IT HAS FORGOTTEN IF IT EVER HEARD THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO FIRST BRIGHTENED ITS GLOOM AND DISSIPATED ITS DARKNESS
EDISON STATES THAT WHILE THE DEVICE IS CRUDELY CAPABLE OF USE AS A MAGNETO TELEPHONE HE DID NOT INVENT IT FOR TRANSMITTING SPEECH BUT AS AN APPARATUS FOR ANALYZING THE COMPLEX WAVES ARISING FROM VARIOUS SOUNDS
31 NORWAY 16 ORANGE FREE STATE
IT WAS ALSO FROM THE BROCKTON CENTRAL STATION THAT CURRENT WAS FIRST SUPPLIED TO A FIRE-ENGINE HOUSE--ANOTHER DISPLAY OF REMARKABLY EARLY BELIEF IN THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THE SERVICE UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE CONTINUITY OF LIGHTING WAS VITAL
I NOTICED ONE FEATHER WHOSE WEIGHT WAS AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIGRAMS RISE PERPENDICULARLY TO THE TOP OF THE FENCE WHERE IT FLOATED AWAY ON THE WIND
ALSO GAITER TOPS
ADAMS WAS ONE OF A CLASS OF OPERATORS NEVER SATISFIED TO WORK AT ANY PLACE FOR ANY GREAT LENGTH OF TIME
HE WOULD ALWAYS RELAX AND HELP TO MAKE A GOOD TIME AND ON SOME OCCASIONS I HAVE SEEN HIM FAIRLY OVERFLOW WITH ANIMAL SPIRITS JUST LIKE A BOY LET OUT FROM SCHOOL
THE GREAT PAPER AT THAT TIME WAS THE DETROIT FREE PRESS
IN THIS CONNECTION IT MAY BE WELL TO QUOTE AN ARTICLE THAT APPEARED AT THE TIME OF MR LOWREY'S DEATH IN 1893
HE WAS THE FIRST TO MAKE A CARBON OF MATERIALS AND BY A PROCESS WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY DESIGNED TO IMPART HIGH SPECIFIC RESISTANCE TO IT
THE MAN AT THE SCALES MIGHT GET TO THINKING OF THE OTHER FELLOW'S BEST GIRL SO FIFTY OR A HUNDRED POUNDS OF ROCK MORE OR LESS WOULDN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE TO HIM THE EDISON CHECKING PLAN EMBRACES TWO HOPPERS SUSPENDED ABOVE TWO PLATFORM SCALES WHOSE BEAMS ARE ELECTRICALLY CONNECTED WITH A HOPPER-CLOSING DEVICE BY MEANS OF NEEDLES DIPPING INTO MERCURY CUPS
WHY DID NOT HIS SON TAKE THIS LAMP TO MR BULL'S OFFICE IN 1892 WHEN HE TOOK THE OLD FIDDLE-BOW LAMPS 1 2 AND 3
WE CANNOT CLOSE THIS CHAPTER HOWEVER WITHOUT MENTION OF THE FATE OF THE PEARL STREET STATION WHICH CONTINUED IN SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIAL OPERATION UNTIL JANUARY 2 1890 WHEN IT WAS PARTIALLY DESTROYED BY FIRE
IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT INVENTION COMMENCED IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A CONCRETE MIXTURE WHICH WOULD OVERCOME THIS CRUCIAL DIFFICULTY
I HAVE BEEN MANY YEARS IN THE BUSINESS BUT HAVE NEVER SEEN AN OPTIC NERVE LIKE THAT OF THIS GENTLEMAN
WE ALSO KNEW THE WIDTH LENGTH AND APPROXIMATE DEPTH OF EVERY ONE OF THESE DEPOSITS WHICH WERE ENORMOUS
I REMEMBER DISTINCTLY WHEN MR EDISON GAVE ME THE PROBLEM OF PLACING A MOTOR IN CIRCUIT IN MULTIPLE ARC WITH A FIXED RESISTANCE
I WAS IN THE DARK-ROOM WHERE I HAD A LOT OF CHLORIDE OF SULPHUR A VERY CORROSIVE LIQUID
ONE OF THESE CONSISTS OF THE CRUSHING AND GRINDING MACHINERY AND THE OTHER OF THE LONG KILNS
U
HE WANTED ME TO SELL OUT MY ASSOCIATES IN THE ELECTRIC LIGHTING BUSINESS AND OFFERED ME ALL I WAS GOING TO GET AND $100,000 BESIDES
ONCE AWARE OF ITS POSSIBILITY SOME OF THE CEMENT MANUFACTURERS PROCEEDED TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE INNOVATION AT FIRST WITHOUT MR EDISON'S CONSENT AND TO-DAY MORE THAN ONE-HALF OF THE PORTLAND CEMENT PRODUCED IN THIS COUNTRY IS MADE IN KILNS OF THE EDISON TYPE
M AND THE PRESS REPORT READ PERFECTLY WHICH SURPRISED ME GREATLY
AND YET IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE TOILFUL CONQUEST OF A SUBTLE AND INTRICATE ART
ELLSWORTH POSSESSED IN A REMARKABLE DEGREE THE SKILL OF IMITATING THESE PECULIARITIES AND THUS HE DECEIVED THE UNION OPERATORS EASILY
6 1880 239,373 ELECTRIC LAMP
RESULTS WORSE THAN NIL
I SYMPATHIZED WITH HIM AND WE BECAME CLOSE COMPANIONS
A FEW DAYS BEFORE HE HAD HELD UP A UNION PACIFIC TRAIN AND ROBBED ALL THE PASSENGERS
ALONG IN THE LATTER PART OF THE NINETIES WHEN THE WORK ON THE PROBLEM OF CONCENTRATING IRON ORE WAS IN PROGRESS IT BECAME NECESSARY WHEN LEAVING THE PLANT AT EDISON TO WAIT OVER AT LAKE HOPATCONG ONE HOUR FOR A CONNECTING TRAIN
IN DECEMBER 1888 MR W
BUT NONE WAS EVER MORE EXTRAORDINARY THAN THAT REFERRED TO HERE AS ARISING FROM THE TRANSFER OF THE AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY TO MR JAY GOULD AND THE ATLANTIC PACIFIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY
IF A LARGE CITY AREA WERE TO BE LIGHTED FROM A CENTRAL STATION BY MEANS OF COPPER CONDUCTORS RUNNING DIRECTLY THEREFROM TO ALL PARTS OF THE DISTRICT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO INSTALL LARGE CONDUCTORS OR SUFFER SUCH A DROP OF PRESSURE AT THE ENDS MOST REMOTE FROM THE STATION AS TO CAUSE THE LIGHTS THERE TO BURN WITH A NOTICEABLE DIMINUTION OF CANDLE-POWER
SO MANY FATALITIES OCCURRED THAT THE INSULATED WIRE USED CALLED UNDERWRITERS BECAUSE APPROVED BY THE INSURANCE BODIES BECAME JOCULARLY KNOWN AS UNDERTAKERS AND EFFORTS WERE MADE TO IMPROVE ITS PROTECTIVE QUALITIES
AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF PAINSTAKING AND HIGHLY INGENIOUS EXPERIMENT PRECEDED EDISON'S SUCCESSFUL RESULT
INDEED AS EDISON SENT THE DARK-BOX APPARATUS TO THE PARIS EXPOSITION IN 1881 AND LET BATCHELOR REPEAT THERE THE PUZZLING EXPERIMENTS IT SEEMS BY NO MEANS UNLIKELY THAT EITHER DIRECTLY OR ON THE REPORT OF SOME FRIEND HERTZ MAY THUS HAVE RECEIVED FROM EDISON A MOST VALUABLE SUGGESTION THE INVENTOR AIDING THE PHYSICIST IN OPENING UP A WONDERFUL NEW REALM
THEN HIS KINDLY GOOD-NATURE REBELLED
IN OTHER WORDS HE INVENTED A TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENT HAVING A VIBRATOR CONTROLLED BY ELECTROCHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION TO TAKE THE PLACE OF A VIBRATING ARMATURE OPERATED BY AN ELECTROMAGNET AND THUS OPENED AN ENTIRELY NEW AND UNSUSPECTED AVENUE IN THE ART

HERTZ PROVING THE EXISTENCE OF ELECTRIC WAVES IN FREE SPACE THAT EDISON REALIZED THE FACT THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF AERIAL TELEGRAPHY HAD BEEN WITHIN HIS GRASP IN THE WINTER OF 1875
FURTHER INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT THE EXPECTED LARGE LEAKAGE OF CURRENT FROM THE RAILS IN WET WEATHER DID NOT MATERIALIZE
FOR ALTHOUGH THE WORK OF HERTZ WAS MORE PROFOUND AND MATHEMATICAL THAN THAT OF EDISON THE PRINCIPLE INVOLVED AND THE PHENOMENA OBSERVED WERE PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL--IN FACT IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT SOME OF THE METHODS AND EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS WERE QUITE SIMILAR ESPECIALLY THE DARK BOX WITH MICROMETER ADJUSTMENT USED BY BOTH IN OBSERVING THE SPARK
EVERYTHING AT THAT TIME WAS WIDE OPEN DISORGANIZATION REIGNED SUPREME
WHEN I GOT THERE I FOUND THAT INSTEAD OF BEING A MACHINE SHOP IT WAS A HOTEL
THE ELECTROMAGNETS AND OTHER ACTUATING MECHANISM CANNOT BE SEEN PLAINLY IN THIS FIGURE BUT ARE PRODUCED DIAGRAMMATICALLY IN FIG
BUT NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT MONEY TO PURCHASE THAT NUMBER I DETERMINED IN MY DESPERATION TO SEE THE EDITOR HIMSELF AND GET CREDIT
AFTER HE HAD CONCEIVED THE BROAD PLAN HIS AMBITION WAS TO CREATE THE INITIAL PLANT ON MANHATTAN ISLAND WHERE IT WOULD BE CONVENIENT OF ACCESS FOR WATCHING ITS OPERATION AND WHERE THE DEMONSTRATION OF ITS PRACTICABILITY WOULD HAVE INFLUENCE IN FINANCIAL CIRCLES
THE BEST SHORTHANDERS AND THE HOLDERS OF GOOD POSITIONS ARE THOSE WHO CAN TAKE A LOT OF RAMBLING INCOHERENT STUFF AND MAKE A RATTLING GOOD SPEECH OUT OF IT GOING BACK TO CINCINNATI AND BEGINNING HIS SECOND TERM THERE AS AN OPERATOR EDISON FOUND THE OFFICE IN NEW QUARTERS AND WITH GREATLY IMPROVED MANAGEMENT
I ORGANIZED A COMPANY AND STARTED CEMENT-WORKS WHICH HAVE NOW BEEN RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY FOR SEVERAL YEARS
IT IS THE CHEAPEST TRANSPORTATION IN THE WORLD
IN THE EFFORTS OF THE PRESENT DAY TO ECONOMIZE SPACE BY USING A MINIMUM LENGTH OF FILM PICTURES ARE FREQUENTLY TAKEN AT TOO SLOW A RATE AND THE REPRODUCTIONS ARE THEREFORE OFTEN OBJECTIONABLE BY REASON OF MORE OR LESS JERKINESS
EDISON DID NOT STAY LONG IN INDIANAPOLIS HOWEVER RESIGNING IN FEBRUARY 1865 AND PROCEEDING TO CINCINNATI
AND ALL THESE LETTERS WERE TURNED OVER TO THE LIGHTING COMPANY BY EDISON FOR ATTENTION
ALL THE MECHANICAL PARTS THE NICKEL PLATING THE MANUFACTURE OF NICKEL FLAKE THE ASSEMBLING AND TESTING ARE CARRIED ON AT THE ORANGE WORKS IN TWO OF THE LARGE CONCRETE BUILDINGS ABOVE REFERRED TO
WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE LABORATORY MR EDISON WHO HAD BEEN UP ALL NIGHT EXPERIMENTING WAS ASLEEP ON THE COT IN THE LIBRARY
AT THIS MOMENT A GREAT DEAL OF EXAGGERATED TALK WAS CURRENT AS TO THE SUNNY LIFE AND EASY WEALTH OF LATIN AMERICA AND UNDER ITS INFLUENCES MANY UNRECONSTRUCTED SOUTHERNERS MADE THEIR WAY TO MEXICO BRAZIL PERU OR THE ARGENTINE
HE STANDS FIVE FEET NINE AND ONE-HALF INCHES HIGH WEIGHS ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE POUNDS AND HAS NOT VARIED AS TO WEIGHT IN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY ALTHOUGH AS A YOUNG MAN HE WAS SLIM TO GAUNTNESS
HE THEN REPUDIATED THE CONTRACT WITH THE AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH PEOPLE AND THEY NEVER RECEIVED A CENT FOR THEIR WIRES OR PATENTS AND I LOST THREE YEARS OF VERY HARD LABOR
I WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS ACQUISITION AND THOSE VERY STRIPS AND THE REWORKED SCRAP ARE USED TO THIS DAY IN MY LABORATORY OVER FORTY YEARS LATER IT WAS AT STRATFORD THAT EDISON'S INVENTIVENESS WAS FIRST DISPLAYED
THIS PATIENT OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF THE OUTCOME OF EXPERIMENTS HAS REMAINED PART OF HIS CHARACTER DOWN TO THIS DAY JUST AS HIS PAINSTAKING MINUTE INCISIVE METHODS ARE STILL UNCHANGED
THIS DEVICE BEING A RELAY ITS PURPOSE IS TO REPEAT TRANSMITTED SIGNALS INTO A LOCAL CIRCUIT AS BEFORE EXPLAINED
THERE WAS OFTEN PLENTY OF WORK FOR BOTH IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE WAR WHEN THE NEWS OF BATTLE CAUSED INTENSE EXCITEMENT AND LARGE SALES OF PAPERS
8 A HINT AS TO AN ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEUTRAL RELAY AS USED IN THE DUPLEX AND AS USED IN THE QUADRUPLEX MAY BE GIVEN
HE OCCUPIED THREE ROOMS AND THERE WERE 300
NIGHT EDITORS INCLUDING HORACE GREELEY AND HENRY RAYMOND OF THE NEW YORK TIMES TOOK THEIR MIDNIGHT LUNCH THERE
EDISON CONCENTRATED HIS POWERS ON THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS TROUBLE AND FOUND THAT THE CHIEF CAUSE LAY IN THE GRAPHITE
I WOULD THEN GO OUT AND GET EACH ONE OUT OF ORDER IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY CUTTING THE WIRES OF ONE SHORT-CIRCUITING ANOTHER DESTROYING THE ADJUSTMENT OF A THIRD PUTTING DIRT BETWEEN THE ELECTRODES OF A FOURTH AND SO ON
WE ARE INDEBTED TO MR INSULL FOR A GRAPHIC SKETCH OF EDISON AT THIS PERIOD AND OF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WORK WAS DONE AND PROGRESS WAS MADE
THESE THEN MAY BE TAKEN AS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF EDISON THAT HAVE ENABLED HIM TO ACCOMPLISH MORE THAN MOST MEN--A STRONG BODY A CLEAR AND ACTIVE MIND A DEVELOPED IMAGINATION A CAPACITY OF GREAT MENTAL AND PHYSICAL CONCENTRATION AN IRON-CLAD NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT KNOWS NO ENNUI INTENSE OPTIMISM AND COURAGEOUS SELF-CONFIDENCE
248,430 EACH CAR AXLE HAD A LARGE IRON DISK MOUNTED ON AND REVOLVING WITH IT BETWEEN THE POLES OF A POWERFUL HORSESHOE ELECTROMAGNET
THE USE OF LIGHTNING-RODS
IN THIS TYPE THE CELL CONTAINING THE ELEMENTS WAS FILLED WITH SAND WHICH WAS KEPT MOIST WITH AN ELECTROLYTE THE TEST UNDER THESE MORE FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES WAS A SUCCESS
WHILE THE FRICTIONAL APPLIANCE IS STILL EMPLOYED IN MEDICINE IT RANKS WITH THE FLINT AXE AND THE TINDER-BOX IN INDUSTRIAL OBSOLESCENCE
THAT HAS ALWAYS PREJUDICED ME AGAINST THAT KIND OF CEREMONIAL AND FOLLY IT IS CERTAINLY INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT IN LATER YEARS THE PRINCE FOR WHOM EDISON ENDURED THE IGNOMINY OF A BLACK EYE MADE GENEROUS COMPENSATION IN A GRACEFUL LETTER ACCOMPANYING THE GOLD ALBERT MEDAL AWARDED BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS
I GUESS THAT QUESTION OF CONDUCTIVITY OF THE POSITIVE POCKET BROUGHT LOTS OF GRAY HAIRS TO HIS HEAD

AFTER DISCUSSING AFFAIRS WITH JOHNSON--WHO WAS RECEIVING HIS FINAL INSTRUCTIONS FROM EDISON--FAR INTO THE NIGHT AND GOING DOWN TO THE STEAMER TO SEE JOHNSON ABOARD I FINISHED MY FIRST NIGHT'S BUSINESS WITH EDISON SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE IN THE MORNING FEELING THOROUGHLY IMBUED WITH THE IDEA THAT I HAD MET ONE OF THE GREAT MASTER MINDS OF THE WORLD
THE TELEGRAPH OPERATING-ROOM WAS IN A DEPLORABLE CONDITION
AND HOW IT WAS RE-ESTABLISHED IN HIS HOME WHERE HE CONTINUED STUDIES AND EXPERIMENTS UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER AS A TELEGRAPH OPERATOR
POPE THE YOUNG TELEGRAPH ENGINEER THEN ASSOCIATED WITH DOCTOR LAWS AND AFTERWARD A DISTINGUISHED EXPERT AND TECHNICAL WRITER WHO BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS IN 1886
THE COST OF HIS SYSTEM MR EDISON PLACED AT FROM $30,000 TO $100,000 PER MILE OF DOUBLE TRACK IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOCAL CONDITIONS AND IN THIS RESPECT COMPARING VERY FAVORABLY WITH THE CABLE SYSTEMS THEN SO MUCH IN FAVOR FOR HEAVY TRAFFIC
THE NEXT MORNING THE FARMER CAME IN VERY EXCITED AND REPORTED THAT THE STUFF HAD KILLED THE VINES AS WELL
THIS SHOWS WHAT A NICE GENIAL GENEROUS LOT OF PEOPLE THEY HAVE OVER IN WALL STREET
A RELAY THUS WOUND IS KNOWN AS A DIFFERENTIAL RELAY--MORE GENERALLY CALLED A NEUTRAL RELAY
9 1906 850,881 COMPOSITE METAL
AS A MATERIAL FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF OFFICE BUILDINGS FACTORIES AND DWELLINGS IT HAS LATELY ENJOYED AN EXTRAORDINARY VOGUE
BUT HE WHO WOULD IMPROVE MUST EXPERIMENT
HE SHOWED EDISON THE WORK HE HAD ALREADY DONE ON THE SUBJECT AND TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD VERY SOON FINISH CALCULATING IT
THEN I WAS COMPELLED TO CHANGE MY PLANS AND GO UPWARD IN THE AIR WHERE REAL ESTATE WAS CHEAP
UP AND DOWN WINDING IN AND OUT TURNING CORNERS DELIVERING MATERIAL FROM ONE TO ANOTHER MAKING A NUMBER OF LOOPS IN THE DRYING-OVEN FILLING UP BINS AND PASSING ON TO THE NEXT WHEN THEY WERE FULL THESE CONVEYORS IN AUTOMATIC ACTION SEEMINGLY PLAYED THEIR PART WITH HUMAN INTELLIGENCE WHICH WAS IN REALITY THE REFLECTION OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND INGENUITY THAT HAD ORIGINALLY DEVISED THEM AND SET THEM IN MOTION
THE TOWN BEING SITUATED IN THE COAL REGION OF PENNSYLVANIA GOOD COAL COULD THEN BE OBTAINED THERE AT SEVENTY-FIVE CENTS A TON
DISTINGUISHED SCIENTISTS FROM EVERY PART OF EUROPE SEEK HIM EAGERLY
IT WAS LITERALLY LOADED WITH COCKROACHES WHICH LIVED BETWEEN THE WALL AND THE BOARD RUNNING AROUND THE ROOM AT THE FLOOR AND WHICH CAME AFTER THE LUNCH

THIS WAS A BOLD STEP TO BE TAKEN BY A NEW-COMER BUT HIS JUDGMENT BACKED BY A FULL CONFIDENCE IN ABILITY TO LIVE UP TO THIS STANDARD HAS BEEN FULLY JUSTIFIED IN ITS CONTINUED MAINTENANCE DESPITE THE EARLY INCREDULITY OF OLDER MANUFACTURERS AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF ATTAINING SUCH A HIGH DEGREE OF FINENESS
SO WE MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE TAMMANY LEADER AND THROUGH HIM WITH THE POLICE TO CLEAR THE STREET--ONE OF THE NEW YORK CROSSTOWN STREETS--AND LINE IT WITH POLICEMEN AS WE PROPOSED TO MAKE A QUICK PASSAGE AND DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME IT WOULD TAKE
HE WHO WAS TO HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE MODERN ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE WAS FASCINATED BY THE MECHANISM OF THE STEAM LOCOMOTIVE
IN BURMAH THE GIANT BAMBOO AS ALREADY MENTIONED IS FOUND INDIGENOUS
COME AROUND IN THREE DAYS AND SIGN IT AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE MONEY I ARRIVED ON TIME BUT HAD BEEN DOING SOME CONSIDERABLE THINKING ON THE SUBJECT
IN THE EARLY PART OF 1873 AND FOR SOME TIME AFTERWARD THE SYSTEM INVENTED BY JOSEPH STEARNS WAS THE DUPLEX IN PRACTICAL USE
IN OPERATION THE MATERIAL PASSED FIRST THROUGH THE UPPER AND MIDDLE ROLLS AND THEN BETWEEN THE MIDDLE AND LOWEST ROLLS
IN OPERATION THE MATERIAL PASSED FIRST THROUGH THE UPPER AND MIDDLE ROLLS AND THEN BETWEEN THE MIDDLE AND LOWEST ROLLS
I HAVE HEREIN GIVEN A VERY BRIEF RESUME OF MY SEARCH FOR FIBRE THROUGH THE ORIENT
AS I HAD ALSO BEEN WORKING ON A TELEGRAPH SYSTEM EMPLOYING TUNING-FORKS SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH BOTH BELL AND GRAY I WAS PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH THE SUBJECT
HUNDREDS OF BOYS WERE RUSHING IN PAYING CHECKS ALL CHECKS BEING PAYABLE TO BELDEN COMPANY
A PROFUSION OF RETORTS ALEMBICS FILTERS AND OTHER CHEMICAL APPARATUS ON NUMEROUS TABLES AND STANDS GREET THE EYE WHILE A CORPS OF EXPERIMENTERS MAY BE SEEN BUSY IN THE PREPARATION OF VARIOUS COMBINATIONS SOME OF WHICH ARE BOILING OR OTHERWISE COOKING UNDER THEIR DEXTEROUS MANIPULATION
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH
HERE AGAIN EDISON REVERSED PRIOR PRACTICE BY DISCARDING ROTARY SCREENS AND DEVISING A FORM OF TOWER SCREEN WHICH BESIDES HAVING A VERY LARGE WORKING CAPACITY BY GRAVITY ELIMINATED ALL POWER EXCEPT THAT REQUIRED TO ELEVATE THE MATERIAL
AN ADDITIONAL ILLUSTRATION APPEALING TO THE EYE IS PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING SKETCH IN WHICH THE COMPARATIVE MASSES OF COPPER OF THE TREE AND FEEDER SYSTEMS FOR CARRYING THE SAME CURRENT ARE SHOWN SIDE BY SIDE
AFTER A SHORT CONVERSATION JOHNSON HURRIED ME OFF TO MEET HIS FAMILY AND LATER IN THE EVENING ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK HE AND I RETURNED TO EDISON'S OFFICE
I HAD BEEN OVER THE OCEAN THREE TIMES AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT SEASICKNESS WAS SO FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED MYSELF
BOTH FOX AND I WERE SO NERVOUS WE DIDN'T SLEEP ANY THAT NIGHT
HE WAS MADE AN OFFICER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR AND PROF GEORGE F
IF NOW THE MOTORS WERE MADE TO RUN DYNAMOS CONVEYING LOW-PRESSURE CURRENTS TO THE PUBLIC THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY WHEREBY THIS HIGH-PRESSURE CURRENT COULD GET TO THE PUBLIC IN OTHER WORDS EDISON MADE THE SHARP FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIGH PRESSURE ALTERNATING CURRENT FOR TRANSMISSION AND LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR DISTRIBUTION
22 22 THE ARGUMENT ON APPEAL WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE DIGNITY AND DECORUM THAT CHARACTERIZE SUCH A PROCEEDING IN THAT COURT

THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE WAS THAT THIS OPERATOR WAS DOING THE BEST HE COULD NOT TO BREAK BUT BEING COMPELLED TO OPENED HIS KEY AND FOUND HE COULDN'T

THE STATUE MOUNTED ON A BASE THREE FEET HIGH IS AN ALLEGORICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE SUPREMACY OF ELECTRIC LIGHT OVER ALL OTHER FORMS OF ILLUMINATION CARRIED OUT BY THE LIFE-SIZE FIGURE OF A YOUTH WITH HALF-SPREAD WINGS SEATED UPON THE RUINS OF A STREET GAS-LAMP HOLDING TRIUMPHANTLY HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AN ELECTRIC INCANDESCENT LAMP
DE LONG WHO HAD AN EARNEST AND PROTRACTED CONVERSATION WITH EDISON OVER THE ARCTIC EXPEDITION HE WAS UNDERTAKING WITH THE AID OF MR JAMES GORDON BENNETT OF THE NEW YORK HERALD
THE FRONT ONE WAS USED AS A KIND OF RECEPTION-ROOM
A MOST CASUAL GLANCE OVER THESE NOTE-BOOKS WILL ILLUSTRATE THE FOLLOWING REMARK WHICH WAS MADE TO ONE OF THE WRITERS NOT LONG AGO BY A MEMBER OF THE LABORATORY STAFF WHO HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTING THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS
THE TOOLS AND APPLIANCES ARE KEPT INTACT FOR EDISON CALLS OCCASIONALLY FOR THEIR USE IN SOME OF HIS LATER EXPERIMENTS AND THERE IS A SUSPICION AMONG THE LABORATORY STAFF THAT SOME DAY HE MAY RESUME WORK ON INCANDESCENT LAMPS
IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION AND CONSIDERED BY THE EDISON COMPANY IN 1882
HE BECAME THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH THE INTRICACIES OF FIRE-BOX BOILER VALVES LEVERS AND GEARS AND LIKED NOTHING BETTER THAN TO HANDLE THE LOCOMOTIVE HIMSELF DURING THE RUN
ON OCTOBER 21 1879 AFTER MANY PATIENT TRIALS HE CARBONIZED A PIECE OF COTTON SEWING-THREAD BENT INTO A LOOP OR HORSESHOE FORM AND HAD IT SEALED INTO A GLASS GLOBE FROM WHICH HE EXHAUSTED THE AIR UNTIL A VACUUM UP TO ONE-MILLIONTH OF AN ATMOSPHERE WAS PRODUCED
THE SURFACE HOWEVER WAS NOT AT FIRST SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE TO ADMIT OF SHARPLY DEFINED PICTURES BEING SECURED AT THE NECESSARILY HIGH RATES
IT IS IN REALITY A MINUTE RECTIFIER OF ALTERNATING CURRENT AND ANALOGOUS TO THOSE WHICH HAVE SINCE BEEN MADE ON A LARGE SCALE
DR NORVIN GREEN THE WELL-KNOWN PRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY WAS PRESIDENT ALSO OF THE EDISON COMPANY BUT THE PRESSING NATURE OF HIS REGULAR DUTIES LEFT HIM NO LEISURE FOR SUCH CLOSE RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT AS WAS NOW REQUIRED
I THOUGHT I WAS ENTITLED TO A PASS WHICH THEY CONCEDED
WHERE IS THE STEAMER THAT GOES ACROSS THE CHANNEL THIS IS THE BOAT THERE HAD BEEN A STORM IN THE NORTH SEA THAT HAD CARRIED AWAY SOME OF THE BOATS ON THE GERMAN STEAMER AND IT CERTAINLY LOOKED AWFUL TOUGH OUTSIDE
SEVENTH--TO INVENT DEVICES THAT WOULD PREVENT THE CURRENT FROM BECOMING EXCESSIVE UPON ANY CONDUCTORS CAUSING FIRE OR OTHER INJURY
SAY I HAVE BEEN MIXED UP IN A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS HAVEN'T I CHAPTER XXVIII THE BLACK FLAG THROUGHOUT THE FORTY-ODD YEARS OF HIS CREATIVE LIFE EDISON HAS REALIZED BY COSTLY EXPERIENCE THE TRUTH OF THE CYNICAL PROVERB THAT A PATENT IS MERELY A TITLE TO A LAWSUIT IT IS NOT INTENDED HOWEVER BY THIS STATEMENT TO LEAD TO ANY INFERENCE ON THE PART OF THE READER THAT HE STANDS PECULIARLY ALONE IN ANY SUCH EXPERIENCE FOR IT HAS BEEN AND STILL IS THE COMMON LOT OF EVERY SUCCESSFUL INVENTOR SOONER OR LATER

WITH THOSE ENGAGED ON NIGHT DUTY HE GOT MIDNIGHT LUNCH FROM AN OLD IRISHMAN CALLED THE CAKE MAN WHO APPEARED REGULARLY WITH HIS WARES AT 12 MIDNIGHT
AT AN APPOINTED HOUR EDISON WENT TO THE OFFICE OF THE MOTOR COMPANY AND FOUND THERE THE VENERABLE PROFESSOR MORSE GOVERNOR CORNELL GENERAL LEFFERTS AND MANY OTHERS WHO HAD BEEN INVITED TO WITNESS A PERFORMANCE OF THE MOTOR
THE HEAT FROM THIS LAMP WOULD PREVENT THE LIQUID FROM FREEZING SO THAT THE METER COULD GO ON DOING ITS DUTY
THE FIRST EDISON CENTRAL STATION XVII
AFTER BEING ON THE TRAIN FOR SEVERAL MONTHS I STARTED TWO STORES IN PORT HURON--ONE FOR PERIODICALS AND THE OTHER FOR VEGETABLES BUTTER AND BERRIES IN THE SEASON
AT THIS TIME AND FOR SOME YEARS PREVIOUSLY THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD HAD BEEN WORKING ON THE SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AS IT WAS THEN TERMED
FOR INSTANCE THE COMPLEX PROBLEM OF A PRACTICAL TELEPHONE TRANSMITTER GAVE RISE TO A SERIES OF MOST EXHAUSTIVE EXPERIMENTS
MY LABORATORY WAS THE HEADQUARTERS FOR THE MEN AND ALSO OF TOOLS AND SUPPLIES FOR THOSE PRIVATE LINES
ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS AT THE WORKS EDISON SAT DOWN AND WROTE ON A SHEET OF PAPER FIFTEEN SEPARATE PREDICTIONS OF THE GROWTH AND FUTURE OF THE ELECTRICAL BUSINESS
5 1882 282,287 MAGNETIC ELECTRIC SIGNALLING APPARATUS
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT WITHIN ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF ACTIVE PATENT LITIGATION THERE HAD BEEN SPENT BY THE OWNERS OF THE EDISON LIGHTING PATENTS UPWARD OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN PROSECUTING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED LAWSUITS BROUGHT AGAINST PERSONS WHO WERE INFRINGING MANY OF THE PATENTS OF EDISON ON THE INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP AND COMPONENT PARTS OF HIS SYSTEM
FORREST AND JOHN MCCULLOUGH WERE PLAYING AT THE NATIONAL THEATRE AND WHEN OUR CAPITAL WAS SUFFICIENT WE WOULD GO TO SEE THOSE EMINENT TRAGEDIANS ALTERNATE IN OTHELLO AND IAGO
THESE SUITS WERE BROUGHT ON THE BERLINER PATENT WHICH IT WAS CLAIMED COVERED BROADLY THE ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION OF SPEECH BY VARIATIONS OF PRESSURE BETWEEN OPPOSING ELECTRODES IN CONSTANT CONTACT
AND HE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT EUROPEAN TELEPHONE SECURITIES WERE MOST SALABLE AS HE WISHED TO RAISE THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO PUT ON THEIR FEET THE INCANDESCENT LAMP FACTORY THE ELECTRIC TUBE WORKS AND THE NECESSARY SHOPS TO BUILD DYNAMOS
THE LOCOMOTIVE WEIGHED THREE TONS WAS TWELVE FEET LONG FIVE FEET WIDE AND MADE A SPEED OF NINE MILES AN HOUR WITH A TRAILER CAR FOR PASSENGERS
A FURTHER STEP IN THIS LINE BROUGHT EDISON TO THE AEROPHONE AROUND WHICH THE FIGARO WEAVED ITS FANCIFUL DESCRIPTION

EACH LAMP MUST BE INDEPENDENT OF EVERY OTHER LAMP
THE SUPERINTENDENT OF TELEGRAPH WHO THEN LIVED IN ADRIAN AND WENT TO HIS OFFICE IN TOLEDO EVERY DAY HAPPENED THAT DAY TO BE IN THE WESTERN UNION OFFICE UP-TOWN--AND IT WAS THE SUPERINTENDENT I WAS REALLY STRUGGLING WITH
MRS GLADSTONE ASKED THE MAN OVER THE TELEPHONE WHETHER HE KNEW IF A MAN OR WOMAN WAS SPEAKING
ONE WAS SIGMUND BERGMANN FOR A TIME PARTNER WITH EDISON IN HIS LIGHTING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND NOW HEAD AND PRINCIPAL OWNER OF ELECTRICAL WORKS IN BERLIN EMPLOYING TEN THOUSAND MEN
IN ONE INSTANCE THE RESENTMENT OF THE VICTIM OF SUCH UNSOUGHT PUBLICITY WAS SO INTENSE HE LAID HANDS ON EDISON AND PITCHED THE STARTLED YOUNG EDITOR INTO THE ST CLAIR RIVER
AND EVEN HIS APPARATUS SUCH AS THE DARK BOX FOR MAKING THE TINY SPARKS VISIBLE AS THE WAVES IMPINGED ON THE RECEIVER BEARS CLOSE ANALOGY WITH SIMILAR APPARATUS EMPLOYED BY HERTZ
FOR A LONG PERIOD THE ARC WAS DOMINANT AND SUPREME IN THE LIGHTING BRANCH OF THE ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES IN ALL RESPECTS WHETHER AS TO INVESTMENT EMPLOYEES INCOME AND PROFITS OR IN RESPECT TO THE MANUFACTURING SIDE
THIS WAS BY NO MEANS THE RESULT OF MERE PUBLIC CURIOSITY BUT ATTESTED THE VALUE OF THE SHEET AS A GENUINE NEWSPAPER TO WHICH MANY PERSONS IN THE RAILROAD SERVICE ALONG THE LINE WERE WILLING CONTRIBUTORS
WHILE MANY INSTANCES COULD BE DEFINITELY NAMED A TYPICAL ONE RELATED BY MR J
1 IN EACH CASE BEING KNOWN AS THE MAIN-LINE COIL AND 2 AS THE ARTIFICIAL-LINE COIL THE LATTER IN EACH CASE HAS IN ITS CIRCUIT A RESISTANCE R TO COMPENSATE FOR THE RESISTANCE OF THE MAIN LINE SO THAT THERE SHALL BE NO INEQUALITIES IN THE CIRCUITS
IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY TO DELIVER THE MATERIAL AT THE TOP OF THE CHAMBERS AND DURING ITS NATURAL DESCENT IT WAS SCREENED OR DRIED AS THE CASE MIGHT BE
BUT ROVING HAS NEVER BEEN FAVORABLE TO THE FORMATION OF STEADY HABITS
AND THE FIELD-CURRENT

LATER ON EDISON SENT OUT AN EXPEDITION TO EXPLORE THE WILDS OF CUBA AND JAMAICA
274,290 APPLIED FOR NOVEMBER 27 1882 AND IS KNOWN AS THE THREE-WIRE PATENT
DIFFICULTIES SEEM TO HAVE A PECULIAR CHARM FOR EDISON WHETHER THEY RELATE TO LARGE OR SMALL THINGS
THE PICKEREL DOUBTLESS ATTRIBUTED TO THE ROACH ALL THIS SHAKING THE REBUFF WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF EDISON'S DISCOVERY OF ACTIVE MASETIALS FOR AN ALKALINE STORAGE BATTERY WAS THE PREPARATION OF THESE MATERIALS
BOATS WERE PROPELLED BY IT CARS WERE HAULED AND EVEN PAPERS PRINTED
I MIX A LITTLE SENTIMENT WITH BUSINESS AND I WILL GIVE YOU AN ORDER FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS AND HE SAT RIGHT DOWN AND GAVE ME THE ORDER THE EDISON CONCENTRATING PLANT HAS BEEN SKETCHED IN THE BRIEFEST OUTLINE WITH A VIEW OF AFFORDING MERELY A BARE IDEA OF THE GREAT WORK OF ITS PROJECTOR

WHILE IT IS ONLY IN USE DURING HIS SOJOURN THERE AND CARRIES NO EXTENSIVE CORPS OF ASSISTANTS THE WORK DONE IN IT IS NOT OF A PERFUNCTORY NATURE BUT IS A CONTINUATION OF HIS REGULAR ACTIVITIES AND SERVES TO KEEP HIM IN TOUCH WITH THE PROGRESS OF EXPERIMENTS AT ORANGE AND ENABLES HIM TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THEIR VARIATION AND CONTINUANCE AS THEIR SCOPE IS EXPANDED BY HIS OWN INVESTIGATIONS MADE WHILE ENJOYING WHAT HE CALLS VACATION WHAT EDISON IN FLORIDA SPEAKS OF AS LOAFING WOULD BE FOR MOST OF US EXTREME AND HEALTHY ACTIVITY IN THE COOLER FAR NORTH
MR MORGAN WAS EXULTANT WHILE MR EDISON WAS STILL CONFIDENT AND SUGGESTED A CONTINUATION OF THE TEST
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE SUMMER OF 1909 THAT EDISON WAS WILLING TO PRONOUNCE THE FINAL VERDICT OF SATISFACTION WITH REGARD TO THIS IMPROVED FORM OF STORAGE BATTERY
AND THE WELL-KNOWN UNIVERSAL TICKER IN WIDE-SPREAD USE IN ITS DAY WAS ONE RESULT
JUNE 10 1897 1898 713,209 DUPLICATING PHONOGRAMS FEB
IN ENGLAND WHEATSTONE AND COOKE HAD INTRODUCED A PONDEROUS MAGNETIC NEEDLE TELEGRAPH
THIS TYPEWRITER PROVED A DIFFICULT THING SAYS EDISON TO MAKE COMMERCIAL
ALSO GIVE BOTTLE A NUMBER AND DESCRIBE EVERYTHING FULLY IN NOTE-BOOK DESTRUCTIVELY DISTIL THE FOLLOWING SUBSTANCES DOWN TO A POINT JUST SHORT OF CARBONIZATION SO THAT THE RESIDUUM CAN BE TAKEN OUT OF THE RETORT POWDERED AND ACTED ON BY ALL THE SOLVENTS JUST AS THE ASPHALT IN PREVIOUS PAGE
HE CHEWED THIS UP AND DISAPPEARED
NEW POLES WERE PUT UP AND THE LIGHTING CIRCUITS ON THEM WITH BUT A SLIGHT INSULATION OF COTTON IMPREGNATED WITH SOME WEATHER-PROOF COMPOUND STRAGGLED ALL OVER THE CITY EXPOSED TO WIND AND RAIN AND ACCIDENTAL CONTACT WITH OTHER WIRES OR WITH THE METAL OF BUILDINGS
THROUGH HIS EXTRAORDINARY ENERGY AND ENTERPRISE THE BUSINESS MADE ENORMOUS STRIDES AND MR RATHENAU HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST CONSPICUOUS INDUSTRIAL FIGURES IN HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
CHANDLER PRESIDENT OF THE POSTAL TELEGRAPH AND CABLE COMPANY
THE STREETS AND BRIDGES OF HOLBORN VIADUCT WERE LIGHTED BY LAMPS TURNED ON AND OFF FROM THE STATION AS WELL AS THE FAMOUS CITY TEMPLE OF DR JOSEPH PARKER THE FIRST CHURCH IN THE WORLD TO BE LIGHTED BY INCANDESCENT LAMPS--INDEED SO FAR AS CAN BE ASCERTAINED THE FIRST CHURCH TO BE ILLUMINATED BY ELECTRICITY IN ANY FORM
MECHANICAL GENERATORS OF ELECTRICITY WERE COMPARATIVELY NEW AT THAT TIME
IN THIS WAY SOUND-WAVES SIMILAR TO THOSE CAUSED BY THE ORIGINAL SOUNDS WOULD BE SET UP IN THE AIR THUS REPRODUCING THE ORIGINAL SPEECH
12 1882 271,613 MANUFACTURE OF INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
BUT WHOSE INTENSE ACTIVITY REMARKABLE GRASP OF ELECTRICAL PRINCIPLES AND UNUSUAL POWERS OF EXPOSITION LED TO HIS FREQUENT DETACHMENT FOR LONG TRIPS INCLUDING THOSE WHICH RESULTED IN THE INTRODUCTION OF THE TELEPHONE PHONOGRAPH AND ELECTRIC LIGHT IN ENGLAND AND ON THE CONTINENT
HE KNEW ENGLISH VERY WELL ALTHOUGH BOHM AND DREYER CONVERSED WITH HIM IN GERMAN
THAT THESE QUALITIES IN EDISON ARE SUPERABUNDANT IS WELL KNOWN TO ALL WHO HAVE WORKED WITH HIM AND INDEED ARE APPARENT TO EVERY ONE FROM HIS MULTIPLIED ACHIEVEMENTS WITHIN THE PERIOD OF ONE GENERATION
IN OTHER CLASSES EDISON HAS DEVISED AN EXCELLENT FORM OF MAGNETIC BRIDGE BEING AN INGENIOUS APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE FAMILIAR WHEATSTONE BRIDGE USED SO EXTENSIVELY FOR MEASURING THE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF WIRES
THE FIRST TRACK WAS ABOUT A THIRD OF A MILE IN LENGTH STARTING FROM THE SHOPS FOLLOWING A COUNTRY ROAD PASSING AROUND A HILL AT THE REAR AND CURVING HOME IN THE GENERAL FORM OF THE LETTER U THE RAILS WERE VERY LIGHT
EACH DYNAMO HAD ITS OWN INDIVIDUAL CONTROL SWITCH
ABOUT THAT TIME WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO RUN SEVERAL DYNAMOS IN PARALLEL IN THE PEARL STREET STATION I GOT HOLD OF GARDINER C
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS RELAY CONSISTS OF A SWINGING PERMANENT MAGNET C WHOSE POLARITY REMAINS FIXED THAT END BETWEEN THE TERMINALS OF THE ELECTROMAGNET BEING A NORTH POLE
MARSHALL JEWELL WAS POSTMASTER-GENERAL OF PRESIDENT GRANT'S CABINET AND DANIEL LAMONT WAS SECRETARY OF STATE IN PRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S
HE IS NOT WHAT I HAVE CALLED IN THE ARGUMENT BELOW AN EXPERT IN THE ART OF TESTIFYING LIKE SOME OF THE OTHERS HE HAS NOT YET BECOME EXPERT
I HAVE GOT SIXTY CENTS AND I AM GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO AND HE DID GO
LODYGUINE KONN KOSLOFF AND KHOTINSKY BETWEEN 1872 AND 1877 PROPOSED VARIOUS INGENIOUS DEVICES FOR PERFECTING THE JOINT BETWEEN THE METAL BASE AND THE GLASS GLOBE AND ALSO PROVIDED THEIR LAMPS WITH SEVERAL SHORT CARBON PENCILS WHICH WERE AUTOMATICALLY BROUGHT INTO CIRCUIT SUCCESSIVELY AS THE PENCILS WERE CONSUMED
THE NET RESULT OF THIS WORK WAS THE GENERAL TYPE OF MACHINE OF WHICH THE WELL-KNOWN PHONOGRAPH OF TODAY IS A REFINEMENT EVOLVED THROUGH MANY YEARS OF SUSTAINED EXPERIMENT AND IMPROVEMENT
NO ONE WHO HAS CAREFULLY FOLLOWED THE COURSE OF THIS NARRATIVE CAN DENY HOWEVER THAT EDISON IS THE FATHER OF SOME OF THE ARTS AND INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED AND THAT AS TO SOME OF THE OTHERS IT WAS THE MAGIC OF HIS TOUCH THAT HELPED MAKE THEM PRACTICABLE
EDISON WITH NATIVE SHREWDNESS ALREADY SO STRIKINGLY DISPLAYED WOULD TELEGRAPH THE STATION AGENTS AND GET THEM TO BULLETIN THE EVENT OF THE DAY AT THE FRONT SO THAT WHEN EACH STATION WAS REACHED THERE WERE EAGER PURCHASERS WAITING
HENCE EDISON WAS ENABLED TO FOLLOW HIS NATURAL BENT IN BEING SURROUNDED DAY AND NIGHT BY HIS RESPONSIBLE CHOSEN ASSOCIATES WITH WHOM HE WORKED UNINTERRUPTED BY OUTSIDERS FROM EARLY MORNING AWAY INTO THE LATE HOURS OF THE EVENING
IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO SLAM THE GATE OPEN AND SHUT
B IS CONNECTED TO THE VIBRATOR AND E TO POINT IN DARK BOX THE OTHER POINT TO GROUND
THESE MOVEMENTS GIVE RISE TO THE CLICKING SOUNDS WHICH REPRESENT THE DOTS AND DASHES OF THE MORSE OR OTHER ALPHABET AS TRANSMITTED BY THE OPERATOR
METALLIC POWDER OF IRON AND NICKEL OR EVEN OXIDES OF THESE METALS PREPARED IN THE ORDINARY WAY ARE NOT CHEMICALLY ACTIVE IN A SUFFICIENT DEGREE TO WORK IN A BATTERY
THIS LEADING PHYSICIST OF HIS AGE AFTERWARD LORD KELVIN WAS AN ADEPT IN TELEGRAPHY HAVING MADE THE OCEAN CABLE TALK AND HE SAW IN EDISON'S AMERICAN AUTOMATIC AS EXHIBITED BY THE ATLANTIC PACIFIC COMPANY A MOST MERITORIOUS AND USEFUL SYSTEM
HIS PHONOGRAPHS AND HIS MOTION PICTURES HAVE MORE AUDIENCES IN A WEEK THAN ALL THE THEATRES IN AMERICA IN A YEAR
BUT WHEN WE NOTICED IT ON THIS VIBRATOR IT SEEMED SO STRONG THAT IT STRUCK US FORCIBLY THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING MORE THAN INDUCTION
AS I HAD HAD SOME PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH THE STATEMENTS OF MINING MEN I CONCLUDED I WOULD JUST SEND DOWN A SMALL PLANT AND PROSPECT THE FIELD BEFORE PUTTING UP A LARGE ONE
REP
EVIDENTLY SUCH A PROCESS IS REVERSIBLE AND THE PHONOGRAPH CAN SEND A MESSAGE TO THE DISTANT RECEIVER
YET WITHOUT DESIRING TO TAKE ANYTHING FROM THE CREDIT OF THE BRILLIANT AMERICAN HUGHES WHOSE TELEGRAPHIC APPARATUS IS STILL IN USE ALL OVER EUROPE IT MAY BE POINTED OUT THAT THIS PASSAGE GIVES EDISON THE ATTRIBUTION OF AT LEAST TWO ORIGINAL FORMS OF WHICH THOSE SUGGESTED BY HUGHES WERE MERE VARIATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS
12 1899 648,935 APPARATUS FOR DUPLICATING PHONOGRAPH RECORDS
AT THAT TIME MOTORS WERE CURIOSITIES
VAN DUZER WAS SO LENIENT THAT IF AN OPERATOR WERE DISCHARGED ALL THE OPERATOR HAD TO DO WAS TO WAIT THREE DAYS AND THEN GO AND SIT ON THE STOOP OF VAN DUZER'S OFFICE ALL DAY AND HE WOULD BE TAKEN BACK
I WENT UP THERE WITH A GENTLEMAN TO SEE THE COMMISSIONER H
ON $600,000 I WOULD GIVE HIM $10,000 OUT OF MY OWN POCKET
IN CONSIDERING THE PHONOGRAPH IN ITS COMMERCIAL ASPECT AND ENDEAVORING TO ARRIVE AT SOME IDEA OF THE WORLD'S ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE OF THIS INVENTION WE FEEL THE GROUND MORE FIRM UNDER OUR FEET FOR EDISON HAS IN LATER YEARS CONTROLLED ITS MANUFACTURE AND SALE
ONE OF THEM WAS THE SUPPER-HOUR WE ENJOYED WHEN WE WORKED NIGHTS
WHILE THE HISTORY OF THIS VAST ARRAY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS POSSESSES A FASCINATING INTEREST FOR THOSE INVOLVED AS WELL AS FOR PROFESSIONAL MEN LEGAL AND SCIENTIFIC IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD EXCITE ANY SUCH FEELING ON THE PART OF A CASUAL READER
A FEW DROPS OF WATER OR PERFUME THROWN ON THE FLOOR OF A ROOM ARE SUFFICIENT TO GIVE A VERY DECIDED INDICATION ON THE GALVANOMETER IN CIRCUIT WITH THE INSTRUMENT
ONE OF THE LADIES HAD A LITTLE POODLE LED BY A STRING
THEY DO NOT INVOLVE ANY WANT OF THE HIGHER BUSINESS ACUMEN THAT GOES TO THE PROPER CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS
MR WALKER TRIED TO GET MY FATHER TO APPRENTICE ME AT $20 PER MONTH BUT THEY COULD NOT AGREE
AT THE TIME IT WAS A TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE AS I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
LET MR MALLORY GIVE AN INSTANCE
AN INCIDENT OF THE TIME IS IN POINT
THOSE COMING UP FROM THE RANKS ARE A DARNED SIGHT BETTER THAN THE OTHERS
AT THE PRESENT TIME THERE ARE OVER 6000 CENTRAL STATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRIC CURRENT FOR LIGHT HEAT AND POWER WITH CAPITAL OBLIGATIONS AMOUNTING TO NOT LESS THAN $1,000,000,000
AROUND 1873 THE OWNERS OF THE AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY COMMENCED NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAY GOULD FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE WIRES BETWEEN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON AND THE PATENTS FOR THE SYSTEM THEN IN SUCCESSFUL OPERATION
THIS CHAPTER WOULD NOT BE COMPLETE IF IT FAILED TO INCLUDE SOME REFERENCE TO A FEW OF THE EARLIER ISOLATED PLANTS OF A HISTORIC CHARACTER
AND THERE FINDING NO SAMPLES GIVING MORE EXCELLENT TESTS IN THE LOWER REACHES OF THE IRRAWADDY I ASCENDED THAT RIVER TO MANDALAY WHERE THROUGH BURMESE BAMBOO WISEACRES I GATHERED IN FROM ROUND ABOUT AND TESTED ALL THAT THE UNUSUALLY RICH BURMESE FLORA COULD FURNISH
WHEN THE SKIPS ARRIVED AT THE GIANT ROLLS THEIR CONTENTS WERE DUMPED AUTOMATICALLY INTO A SUPERIMPOSED HOPPER
THEY HAD ONE IN THE JAIL AND FOX AND I WENT OVER TO SEE HIM
AND SOME IDEA OF THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY THEM IN SO DOING MAY BE REALIZED FROM THE FACT THAT ONE BRIEF CHAPTER FOR EXAMPLE,--THAT ON ORE MILLING--COVERS NINE YEARS OF MOST INTENSE APPLICATION AND ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF THE INVENTOR
A FALLACY IS CONCEALED IN IT HE THEN GOES ON TO PROVE HIS CASE MATHEMATICALLY TO HIS OWN SATISFACTION FOLLOWING IT SADLY BY CONDOLING WITH AND A WARNING TO EDISON

THAT HIS REASONINGS AND DEDUCTIONS WERE CORRECT IN THIS CASE HAVE BEEN INDUBITABLY PROVEN BY SOME YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE LONG KILN IN ITS ABILITY TO PRODUCE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND BARRELS OF GOOD CLINKER EVERY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS WITH AN EXPENDITURE FOR COAL PROPORTIONATELY EQUAL TO ABOUT ONLY 20 PER CENT
WHEN WE WENT OVER IT WE MUST HAVE BEEN GOING FORTY MILES AN HOUR AND I COULD SEE THE PERSPIRATION COME OUT ON HENDERSON
AT THE CLOSE OF THE EPOCH OF DISCOVERY IT IS SEEN THAT MANKIND AS A WHOLE HAS MADE ONE MORE GREAT ADVANCE
OF THE ROCK TAKEN FROM THE VEINS OF ORE SO THAT EVERY FOUR TONS OF CRUDE RAW LOW-GRADE ORE WILL HAVE YIELDED ROUGHLY ONE TON OF HIGH-GRADE CONCENTRATE AND THREE TONS OF SAND THE LATTER ALSO HAVING ITS VALUE IN VARIOUS WAYS THIS SAND WAS TRANSPORTED AUTOMATICALLY BY BELT CONVEYORS TO THE REAR OF THE WORKS TO BE STORED AND SOLD
BUT ASIDE FROM THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THOSE ENTERTAINING PUPPETS ALL ELSE IS GAIN IN THE CREATION OF THIS NEW ART
THE FIRST IN 1865 FOR A SEWING-MACHINE HEMMER AND THE LAST IN 1882 FOR AN IMPROVEMENT IN INCANDESCENT LAMPS
4 1882 365,465 VALVE GEAR OCT
A WICKED PARTNER
IT IS QUITE NATURAL THEREFORE THAT THE IDEA OF MAGNETIC SEPARATION SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO MANY INVENTORS
FOUR OLD MICHIGAN CENTRAL CARS WITH ROTTEN SILLS COLLAPSED IN THE DITCH AND WENT ALL TO PIECES DISTRIBUTING FIGS RAISINS DATES AND CANDIES ALL OVER THE TRACK AND THE VICINITY
SIR W
THIS WILL DO THE BUSINESS BROAD AND LARGE AS A CONTINENT IN HIS IDEAS IF EVER THERE WAS A MAN OF FINICAL FUSSINESS IN ATTENTION TO DETAIL IT IS EDISON
KENNELLY NOW PROFESSOR OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY TO WHOSE ENERGETIC AND CAPABLE MANAGEMENT WERE INTRUSTED MANY SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS DURING HIS LONG SOJOURN AT THE LABORATORY
SO FAR AS THE WRITERS CAN ASCERTAIN THIS IS THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF FIELD TELEPHONY ANOTHER NAUTICAL EXPERIMENT THAT HE MADE AT THIS TIME SUGGESTED PROBABLY BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ARCTIC EXPEDITION WAS A BUOY THAT WAS FLOATED IN NEW YORK HARBOR AND WHICH CONTAINED A SMALL EDISON DYNAMO AND TWO OR THREE INCANDESCENT LAMPS
IN A FEW MOMENTS HE ASKED FOR THE HEAD MAN AND I WAS BROUGHT FORWARD
13 1902 802,631 APPARATUS FOR BURNING PORTLAND CEMENT CLINKER
AGAIN HE WAS ASSAILED AND RIDICULED BY THE TECHNICAL PRESS FOR HAD NOT THE FOREMOST ELECTRICIANS AND PHYSICISTS OF EUROPE AND AMERICA WORKED FOR YEARS ON THE PRODUCTION OF DYNAMOS AND ARC LAMPS AS THEY THEN EXISTED
USING NO NAMES I ASKED THE LATTER TO EXAMINE THE GENTLEMAN'S EYES
HENCE AFTER SUPPLYING AN ALL-NIGHT CUSTOMER WHOSE LAMPS WERE ON ONE SIDE OF THE CIRCUITS THE COMPANY MIGHT BE FOUND TO OWE HIM SOME THING SUBSTANTIAL IN THE MORNING
THERE ISN'T A MAN IN THE UNITED STATES WHO COULD RECITE THOSE NAMES WITH THE SAME RAPIDITY THE PHONOGRAPH WAS NOW FAIRLY LAUNCHED AS A WORLD SENSATION AND A REFERENCE TO THE NEWSPAPERS OF 1878 WILL SHOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT AND EDISON WERE THEMES OF UNIVERSAL DISCUSSION
THIS BROUGHT THE STORAGE BATTERY AT ONCE INTO USE AS A PRACTICAL MANUFACTURED PIECE OF APPARATUS
IN OTHER WORDS MR EDISON WAS AT LEAST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AHEAD OF THE TIMES IN THE WORK NOW TO BE CONSIDERED
THE OFFICE WAS LOCATED IN A JEWELRY STORE WHERE NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS WERE ALSO SOLD
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT UPON THE CYLINDER THERE ARE AS MANY PINS AS THERE ARE CHARACTERS ON THE TYPE-WHEELS OF THE TICKER AND ONE OF THE SEGMENTAL WHEELS W HAS A LIKE NUMBER OF METALLIC SEGMENTS WHILE UPON THE OTHER WHEEL W THERE ARE ONLY ONE-HALF THAT NUMBER
IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR FORCE THERE WAS AN EXTRA FORCE OF TWO OR THREE OPERATORS AND SOME STRANDED ONES WHO WERE A BURDEN TO US FOR BOARD WAS HIGH
SPARKS IDENTICAL IN ALL RESPECTS WITH THOSE DISCOVERED BY HERTZ HAD BEEN SEEN IN RECENT TIMES BOTH BY EDISON AND BY SYLVANUS THOMPSON BEING STYLED ETHERIC FORCE BY THE FORMER
IN MY WHOLE LIFE I NEVER SPENT SUCH A NIGHT OF HORROR AS THIS BUT I GOT A GOOD LESSON AN AMUSING INCIDENT OF THIS PERIOD IS TOLD BY EDISON
I TOLD HIM OF MY ARRANGEMENT WITH THE ELECTRICIAN AND SAID I COULD NOT SELL IT AS A WHOLE TO ANYBODY
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD MAKE CLINICAL THERMOMETERS
AND 4 THE FERRIC CYANIDE OF IRON SOLUTION
THIS KIND OF APPLICATION I WAS LOOKING FOR
I GUESS IT WAS SATISFACTORY
I DID WHATEVER HE TOLD ME AND LOOKED AFTER ALL KINDS OF AFFAIRS FROM BUYING HIS CLOTHES TO FINANCING HIS BUSINESS
THIS REQUIRES THREE OR FOUR DAYS
AND IT CAME DOWN AGAIN JUST WITHIN AN INCH OF MY NOSE AND WENT CLEAR THROUGH A TWO-INCH PLANK
THE PRESERVATION OF LANGUAGES BY EXACT REPRODUCTION OF THE MANNER OF PRONOUNCING
HE REQUESTED THAT I GIVE HIM SOME SO I GOT THE MORPHINE SULPHATE
WITH THE FIRST YEAR OF THE NEW CENTURY CAME VOLTA'S INVENTION OF THE CHEMICAL BATTERY AS A MEANS OF PRODUCING ELECTRICITY
FOR INSTANCE HE HAD GONE TO BED THE NIGHT BEFORE EXACTLY AT TWELVE AND HAD ARISEN AT 4.30 A
IT WILL BE CLEAR THEREFORE THAT IF TWO EQUAL CURRENTS BE PASSED AROUND A BAR IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS FIG
HERE AFTER THE FILM HAS BEEN PASSED UPON BY A COMMITTEE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF POSITIVE COPIES ARE MADE BY INGENIOUS PROCESSES AND AFTER EACH ONE IS SEPARATELY TESTED OR RUN OFF IN ONE OR OTHER OF THE THREE MOTION-PICTURE THEATRES IN THE BUILDING THEY ARE SHIPPED OUT TO FILM EXCHANGES IN EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY
THE LURE OF 1878 WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY THE ABILITY OF HIS DELICATE TASIMETER DURING THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN JULY 29
THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE CHICAGO EDISON COMPANY NOW ONE OF THE LARGEST OF THE SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD
A SAVING OF POWER
THE MANUFACTURE OF THE PROJECTING MACHINES AND ACCESSORIES TOGETHER WITH THE REPRODUCTION OF FILMS IS CARRIED ON AT THE ORANGE VALLEY PLANT AND FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE MOTION-PICTURE BUSINESS TO THE PRESENT TIME THERE HAVE BEEN MADE UPWARD OF 16,000 PROJECTING MACHINES AND MANY MILLION FEET OF FILMS CARRYING SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS OF MOVING OBJECTS
4 1879 222,881 MAGNETO ELECTRIC MACHINES
THE STATION EQUIPMENT AT BROCKTON CONSISTED AT FIRST OF THREE DYNAMOS ONE OF WHICH WAS SO ARRANGED AS TO SUPPLY BOTH SIDES OF THE SYSTEM DURING LIGHT LOADS BY A BREAKDOWN SWITCH CONNECTION
THUS SUPPORTING HIMSELF HE FELT ENTITLED TO SPEND ANY OTHER PROFIT LEFT OVER ON CHEMICALS AND APPARATUS
I'LL GIVE HIM THAT AND HE'LL GET THERE ALL RIGHT THIS WAS IN THE EARLY DAYS OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING
EDISON'S MOTHER WAS AN ATTRACTIVE AND HIGHLY EDUCATED WOMAN WHOSE INFLUENCE UPON HIS DISPOSITION AND INTELLECT HAS BEEN PROFOUND AND LASTING
THAT ADVERSE DECISION AT ST LOUIS WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MADE IF THE COURT COULD HAVE SEEN THE MEN WHO SWORE FOR GOEBEL
BUT IT IS ONLY PROPER HERE TO NOTE IN PASSING THE CURIOUS FACT THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY PRODUCED A DEVICE THAT COULD TALK PRIOR TO 1876 AND WAS THEREFORE VERY CLOSE TO BELL WHO TOOK THE ONE GREAT STEP FURTHER
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT NEARLY FORTY YEARS AGO NOT A GREAT WHILE AFTER HE HAD EMERGED FROM THE RANKS OF PERIPATETIC TELEGRAPH OPERATORS HE WAS THE OWNER OF A LARGE AND PROFITABLE BUSINESS AS A MANUFACTURER OF THE TELEGRAPHIC APPARATUS INVENTED BY HIM THE CALL OF HIS NATURE WAS TOO STRONG TO ALLOW OF PROFITS BEING LAID AWAY IN THE BANK TO ACCUMULATE
JUST WHAT ALL THIS MEANS IT IS HARD FOR THE PRESENT GENERATION TO IMAGINE
14 1883 297,586 ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR SEPT
A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS WERE WITNESSED IN ARC LIGHTING AND EDISON SECURED A SMALL WALLACE-FARMER DYNAMO FOR HIS OWN WORK AS WELL AS A SET OF WALLACE ARC LAMPS FOR LIGHTING THE MENLO PARK LABORATORY
WE GOT THE MONEY WHICH WAS THE MAIN POINT TO US EDISON TELLS THE STORY IN A SIMILAR MANNER BUT INSISTS THAT IT WAS HE WHO SAVED THE SITUATION
WHILE THE PREPARATION OF DATA FOR THIS CHAPTER WAS GOING ON ONE OF THE WRITERS IN DISCUSSING WITH HIM THE VAST ARRAY OF UNEXPLOITED THINGS SAID
IT WENT INTO SERVICE AUGUST 15 1882 ABOUT THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE PEARL STREET STATION
THE WIRE AT THE TIME WAS VERY BUSY AND I ASKED IF I SHOULD BREAK IN
A GOOD STIFF DIFFICULTY--ONE WHICH MAY PERHAPS APPEAR TO BE AN UNSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE--ONLY SERVES TO MAKE EDISON CHEERFUL AND BRINGS OUT VARIATIONS OF HIS METHODS IN EXPERIMENTING
THIS IS A GREAT DISCOVERY FOR ELECTRIC LIGHT IN THE WAY OF ECONOMY THIS PERIOD OF RESEARCH ON NICKEL ETC WAS EVIDENTLY A TRYING ONE FOR AFTER NEARLY A MONTH'S CLOSE APPLICATION HE WRITES ON JANUARY 27 1879
AT THAT TIME I WAS VERY SHORT OF MONEY AND NEEDED IT MORE THAN GLORY
23 1872 126,530 PRINTING TELEGRAPHS
A GIVEN STRAIGHT WIRE HAVING 1 OHM RESISTANCE AND CERTAIN LENGTH IS BROUGHT TO A GIVEN DEGREE OF TEMPERATURE BY GIVEN BATTERY
SUCH MACHINES WERE CONFESSEDLY INEFFICIENT ALTHOUGH REPRESENTING THE FARTHEST REACH OF A YOUNG ART
TWOMBLY VANDERBILT'S ABLEST SON-IN-LAW WHO MADE A SUCCESS OF IT
HE DID NOT TRY THE EFFECT OF SOUND-WAVES PRODUCED BY THE HUMAN VOICE UNTIL BELL CAME FORWARD A FEW MONTHS LATER
AND WHILE IT CONTINUES THERE WILL BE NEW ACHIEVEMENT
I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE LOSS OF THESE SEVENTY-EIGHT INVENTIONS HAS LEFT A SORE SPOT IN ME THAT HAS NEVER HEALED
HE HAS ALSO PROVIDED FOR ORNAMENTATION OF A HIGH CLASS IN DESIGNING THE DETAILS OF THE STRUCTURE
THE CROWD WAS THERE AND I RAISED THE PRICE
IT IS A FAR CRY FROM THE CRUDE STRUCTURE OF EARLY DAYS--THE BLACK MARIA OF 1891 SWUNG AROUND ON ITS PIVOT IN THE ORANGE LABORATORY YARD--TO THE WELL-APPOINTED EDISON THEATRES OR PANTOMIME STUDIOS IN NEW YORK CITY
THEY ARE AS SOLID AS WHEN THEY WERE BUILT WITH SUCH CONVICTIONS AND THE VAST FUND OF PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE HE HAD GAINED AT EDISON IN THE CRUSHING AND MANIPULATION OF LARGE MASSES OF MAGNETIC IRON ORE DURING THE PRECEDING NINE YEARS IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT ON THAT HOMEWARD RAILWAY JOURNEY MENTIONED AT THE CLOSE OF THE PRECEDING CHAPTER HE SHOULD HAVE DECIDED TO GO INTO THE MANUFACTURE OF CEMENT ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE ENORMOUS GROWTH OF ITS USE FOR STRUCTURAL PURPOSES DURING RECENT TIMES
TWO WERE OF IRON AND TWO OF TELLURIUM IT BEING THE GIST OF EDISON'S PLAN TO EFFECT THE MARKING OF THE CHEMICAL PAPER BY ONE METAL WITH A POSITIVE CURRENT AND BY THE OTHER METAL WITH A NEGATIVE CURRENT
IN THIS CONNECTION IT MAY BE NOTED THAT WITH REMARKABLE PRESCIENCE EDISON SAW THE COMING OF THE MODERN LAMPS OF TO-DAY WHICH BY REASON OF THEIR SMALL CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY TO PRODUCE A GIVEN CANDLE-POWER HAVE DISMAYED CENTRAL-STATION MANAGERS
AFTER THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE FACT IT WOULD SEEM TO BE THE OBVIOUS THING TO USE A SINGLE LENS AND MOVE THE SENSITIZED FILM WITH RESPECT TO IT INTERMITTENTLY BRINGING THE SURFACE TO REST THEN EXPOSING IT THEN CUTTING OFF THE LIGHT AND MOVING THE SURFACE TO A FRESH POSITION

IT TOOK A LITTLE TIME TO ACQUIRE THE KNACK OF TURNING THE CRANK STEADILY WHILE LEANING OVER THE RECORDER TO TALK INTO THE MACHINE
BUT THE STAKE WAS WORTH THE EFFORT
HENCE BY MEANS OF THIS LEAK POWERFUL CURRENTS WERE PASSING THROUGH THIS THIN LAYER OF MOIST EARTH
I MANAGED TO SAY THAT I WOULD WORK THE APPARATUS AND MR ADAMS WOULD MAKE THE EXPLANATIONS
EACH BLOCK HAD SIXTEEN CONSUMERS USING FIFTEEN LIGHTS EACH
I THUS KEPT POSTED AND KNEW FROM THEIR ACTIVITY EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND WHAT COMMITTEES THEY WERE ON
THIS PUT MY RIVAL ON HIS METTLE AND HE PUT ON HIS BEST POWERS WHICH HOWEVER WERE SOON REACHED
THE STORY OF THE PHONOGRAPH AS AN INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE FROM THIS POINT OF DEPARTURE IS ITSELF FULL OF INTEREST BUT EMBRACES SO MANY DETAILS THAT IT IS NECESSARILY GIVEN IN A SEPARATE LATER CHAPTER
19 1881 251,548 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
THIS PRINCIPLE AND ITS APPLICATION IN PRACTICE WERE QUITE CORRECT AS REGARDS CHEMICAL BATTERIES BUT NOT AS REGARDS DYNAMO MACHINES
IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS THE KINETIC ENERGY OF THE ROLLS THAT CRUMBLED UP THE ROCKS WITH PILE-DRIVER EFFECT
IT WAS HIS OPINION THAT IT WAS CHEAPER TO QUARRY AND CONCENTRATE LEAN ORE IN A BIG WAY THAN TO ATTEMPT TO MINE UNDER ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED BODIES OF HIGH-GRADE ORE
FINALLY THE JEW GOT UP TO $800
19 1881 248,422 SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING
AFTER THAT EXHIBITION WE HAD A HOUSE-CLEANING AT THE LABORATORY AND THE METALLIC-FILAMENT LAMPS WERE STORED AWAY WHILE PREPARATIONS WERE MADE FOR OUR EXPERIMENTS ON CARBON LAMPS THUS THE WORK WENT ON
THE FIRST WAS TO LORD KELVIN THE NESTOR OF PHYSICS IN EUROPE FOR HIS WORK IN SUBMARINE-CABLE TELEGRAPHY AND OTHER SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENT
HE SAYS OF THIS
7 1881 263,146 DYNAMO MAGNETO ELECTRIC MACHINES NOV
EVEN SUPPOSING THAT THERE BE A SLIGHT INTERVAL OF TIME DURING WHICH THE SAME OBJECT WAS NOT SHOWN THE PERSISTENCE OF THE LUMINOUS IMPRESSION UPON THE EYE WILL FILL THIS GAP
MR BERGMANN NOW I KNOW WHERE MY POWER GOES TO POINTING TO THE DYNAMO
THEY COULD FIND NO PRAISE WARM ENOUGH FOR THE MAN WHO HAD ORGANIZED THE ECHOES AND TAMED THE LIGHTNING AND WHOSE CAREER WAS SO PICTURESQUE WITH EVENTFUL AND ROMANTIC DEVELOPMENT
FARMER IN 1852 HAD BEEN ELABORATED BY MANY INGENIOUS INVENTORS NOTABLY IN THIS COUNTRY BY STEARNS BEFORE EDISON ONCE AGAIN APPLIED HIS MIND TO IT
JUNE 2 1892 485,842 MAGNETIC ORE SEPARATION
IN FACT HE REALIZED AS NO ONE ELSE DID AT THIS STAGE THE TREMENDOUS IMPORT OF THIS NOVEL AND COMPREHENSIVE SCHEME FOR GIVING THE WORLD LIGHT
24 1884 438,304 ELECTRIC SIGNALLING APPARATUS
BUT EDISON THOUGH DEAF COULD NOT MAKE TOO HURRIED A RETREAT FROM NEWARK TO MENLO PARK WHERE AS IF TO JUSTIFY HIS CHANGE OF BASE VITAL INVENTIONS SOON CAME THICK AND FAST YEAR AFTER YEAR
IT WAS AN IDEAL COMBINATION THAT OF EDISON BATCHELOR AND KRUESI
THE DIRECTORS OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY COULD NOT BE INDUCED TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY AND MR INSULL STATES THAT THE MONEY ADVANCED WAS TREATED BY MR EDISON AS A PERSONAL LOAN AND REPAID TO MR VILLARD FOR WHOM HE HAD A HIGH ADMIRATION AND A STRONG FEELING OF ATTACHMENT
AND THE LINE BATTERY AND INSPECTING MEN ALL SCATTERED THROUGH THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT TO SET THE INSTRUMENTS
THE FRAMES HAVING SERVED THEIR PURPOSE NOW GO BACK TO THE SCENE-PAINTER FOR FURTHER USE
A YEAR LATER THEY SAID
DON'T WANT ANY ONE WHO YEARNS TO ENTER A LABORATORY AND EXPERIMENT
AMONG THESE MANY THOUSANDS OF EXPERIMENTS ANY THAT SHOWED EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS WERE AGAIN ELABORATED BY STILL FURTHER SERIES OF TESTS UNTIL EDISON WAS SATISFIED THAT HE HAD OBTAINED THE BEST RESULT IN THAT PARTICULAR LINE
THIS SCHEME WAS OBJECTED TO ON THE GROUND THAT PARTICLES OF GRAPHITE WOULD FILL THESE AIR-SPACES AND CAUSE A SHORT-CIRCUIT
THE ENGLISH COMPANY I NEVER GOT ANYTHING FOR BECAUSE A LAWYER HAD ORIGINALLY ADVISED DREXEL MORGAN CO
EDISON ALWAYS ENJOYED OTHELLO GREATLY
THUS THE POSITIVE PLATE BECOMES OXIDIZED AND THE NEGATIVE PLATE REDUCED
STEAM IS HALF AN ENGLISHMAN SAID EMERSON
HENCE A DIAGRAM SHOWING A SECTIONAL VIEW OF A SIMPLE FORM OF SUCH A CAMERA IS PRESENTED BELOW
JUNE 1 1883 287,511 ELECTRIC REGULATOR JUNE 25 1883 287,512 DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE
UPON OPENING THE DOOR A TALL HANDSOME MAN WITH FLOWING HAIR DRESSED IN WESTERN STYLE ENTERED THE ROOM
GLENMONT IS A RATHER ELABORATE AND FLORID BUILDING IN QUEEN ANNE ENGLISH STYLE OF BRICK STONE AND WOODEN BEAMS SHOWING ON THE EXTERIOR WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF GABLES AND BALCONIES
HEREIN THEN ARE SET FORTH IN BRIEFEST SPACE THE PRELIMINARIES OF A CIRCUIT OF THE GLOBE IN QUEST OF FIBRE
BUT IN THE MEAN TIME EDISON HAD LEARNED MANY LESSONS AS TO THIS PRACTICAL SIDE OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WERE NOT FORGOTTEN WHEN THE RENASCENCE OF THE PHONOGRAPH BEGAN A FEW YEARS LATER LEADING UP TO THE PRESENT ENORMOUS AND STEADY DEMAND FOR BOTH MACHINES AND RECORDS
THIS CONSISTED OF A HOLLOW WOODEN FORM OF THE DIMENSIONS INDICATED
AND THE WORD MEGAPHONE IS UNIVERSALLY APPLIED TO THE SINGLE SIDE-FLARING HORN
EDISON'S REMARKABLE PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE IN DEALING WITH THIS TRYING PROBLEM AND IN FINALLY SOLVING IT SUCCESSFULLY WON FOR HIM MORE THAN ORDINARY ADMIRATION FROM HIS ASSOCIATES
I WAS HANDLING THE TELEPHONE AT THE BURLINGTON HOUSE END
WITH AN IDEA OF SECURING CURRENT CHEAPLY EDISON APPLIED THE LITTLE THAT HE KNEW ABOUT STATIC ELECTRICITY AND ACTUALLY EXPERIMENTED WITH CATS WHICH HE TREATED VIGOROUSLY AS FRICTIONAL MACHINES UNTIL THE ANIMALS FLED IN DISMAY AND EDISON HAD LEARNED HIS FIRST GREAT LESSON IN THE RELATIVE VALUE OF SOURCES OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY
10 1891 1892 491,993 STOP DEVICE
IN FACT IT IS THIS VERY REVERSAL OF USUAL PROCEDURE THAT RENDERS IT DIFFICULT FOR THE AVERAGE MIND TO INSTANTLY GRASP THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRINCIPLES INVOLVED AND THE RESULTS ATTAINED
4 1887 382,462 PHONOGRAM BLANKS DEC
AND THE LOSS 82 PER CENT EDISON REVERSED THESE FIGURES AND IN HIS THREE-HIGH ROLLS PRODUCED A WORKING EFFICIENCY OF 84 PER CENT THUS REDUCING THE LOSS OF POWER BY FRICTION TO 16 PER CENT
AFTER TALKING OVER OLD ACQUAINTANCES I ASKED HIM IF THERE WAS ANY GAME AROUND
THIS MACHINE SHOP IS WELL EQUIPPED AND IN IT IS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED A LARGE FORCE OF MECHANICS WHOSE TIME IS OCCUPIED IN CONSTRUCTING THE HEAVIER CLASS OF MODELS AND MECHANICAL DEVICES CALLED FOR BY THE VARIED EXPERIMENTS AND INVENTIONS ALWAYS GOING ON
AT THE PEARL STREET STATION HOWEVER THE MACHINES WERE SUPPORTED UPON LONG IRON FLOOR-BEAMS AND AT THE HIGH SPEED OF 350 REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE CONSIDERABLE VERTICAL VIBRATION WAS GIVEN TO THE ENGINES
I HAD BEEN CONNECTED WITH EDISON'S AFFAIRS IN ENGLAND AS PRIVATE SECRETARY TO HIS LONDON AGENT FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS
WE SPENT A DAY AT MEUDON AN OLD PALACE GIVEN BY THE GOVERNMENT TO JANSEN THE ASTRONOMER
INTRODUCTION TO THE APPENDIX THE READER WHO HAS FOLLOWED THE FOREGOING NARRATIVE MAY FEEL THAT INASMUCH AS IT IS INTENDED TO BE AN HISTORICAL DOCUMENT AN APPROPRIATE ADDENDUM THERETO WOULD BE A DIGEST OF ALL THE INVENTIONS OF EDISON
ON TWO PEDESTALS STAND RESPECTIVELY TWO OTHER MEMENTOES OF THE WORKS ONE A FIFTEEN-LIGHT DYNAMO OF THE EDISON TYPE AND THE OTHER AN ELABORATE ELECTRIC FAN--BOTH OF THEM GIFTS FROM ASSOCIATES OR EMPLOYEES
BUT THE ASSISTANT AT THE OTHER END COULD NOT BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING NOTWITHSTANDING I HAD WRITTEN OUT A VERY MINUTE DESCRIPTION OF JUST WHAT TO DO
IN 1875 BELL WHO AS A STUDENT AND TEACHER OF VOCAL PHYSIOLOGY HAD UNUSUAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR DETERMINING FEASIBLE METHODS OF SPEECH TRANSMISSION CONSTRUCTED HIS FIRST PAIR OF MAGNETO TELEPHONES FOR SUCH A PURPOSE
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DID ANYTHING IN ELECTRICITY WERE THE TELEGRAPHERS AND THE OPTICIANS MAKING SIMPLE SCHOOL APPARATUS TO DEMONSTRATE THE PRINCIPLES ONE OF THESE FIRMS WAS PALMER HALL WHOSE CATALOGUE OF 1850 SHOWED A MINIATURE ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE MADE BY MR THOMAS HALL AND EXHIBITED IN OPERATION THE FOLLOWING YEAR AT THE CHARITABLE MECHANICS FAIR IN BOSTON
WE WILL TRY THAT FIRST
LATER ON ANOTHER CHEMICAL LABORATORY WAS INSTALLED NEAR THE PHOTOMETER-ROOM AND THIS DR A
OH SAID ADAMS I WANT MEN'S SIZE WELL SIR WE DO NOT PERMIT ONE TO PICK SIZES FOR THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THE CROWD ROARED
EDISON'S CONCRETE HOUSE HOWEVER INVOLVES TWO MAIN CONSIDERATIONS FIRST OF WHICH WAS THE CONCEPTION OR CREATION OF THE IDEA--VAST AND COMPREHENSIVE--OF PROVIDING IMPERISHABLE AND SANITARY HOMES FOR THE WAGE-EARNER BY MOLDING AN ENTIRE HOUSE IN ONE PIECE IN A SINGLE OPERATION SO TO SPEAK AND SO SIMPLY THAT EXTENSIVE GROUPS OF SUCH DWELLINGS COULD BE CONSTRUCTED RAPIDLY AND AT VERY REASONABLE COST
IN THIS CONNECTION A SHORT ANECDOTE MAY BE QUOTED FROM EDISON AS INDICATIVE OF ONE OF THE INFLUENCES TURNING HIS THOUGHTS IN THIS DIRECTION
25 1882 287,518 MANUFACTURE OF INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
25 FOOTNOTE 25
PERHAPS IT IS NOT SURPRISING THEN THAT THE DYNAMO WAS LOOSELY REGARDED BY ELECTRICIANS AS THE PRACTICAL EQUIVALENT OF A CHEMICAL BATTERY
THE FAMOUS NOTE-BOOKS TO WHICH REFERENCE WILL BE MADE LATER WERE NOT BEGUN AS A REGULAR SERIES AS IT WAS ONLY THE PROFUSION OF THESE IDEAS THAT SUGGESTED THE VITAL VALUE OF SUCH SYSTEMATIC REGISTRATION
HE HAD TO WAIT A FEW DAYS AND DURING THIS TIME HE SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THE INDICATORS AND THE COMPLICATED GENERAL TRANSMITTER IN THE OFFICE CONTROLLED FROM THE KEYBOARD OF THE OPERATOR ON THE FLOOR OF THE GOLD EXCHANGE
THE MOMENT TROOPS WERE IN POSITION TO GO INTO CAMP THE MEN WOULD PUT UP THEIR WIRES
AND THE DOWAGER QUEEN ALEXANDRA--AND THE PRINCESS RECEIVED FROM MR JOHNSON AS A SOUVENIR A TINY ELECTRIC CHANDELIER FASHIONED LIKE A BOUQUET OF FERN LEAVES AND FLOWERS THE BUDS BEING SOME OF THE FIRST MINIATURE INCANDESCENT LAMPS EVER MADE
SPEAKING OF TELLING STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAMP FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
MAY 21 1881 264,657 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
ON TURNING THE MAIN SHAFT OF THE CAMERA THE SPROCKET G IS MOVED INTERMITTENTLY AND ITS TEETH CATCHING IN THE HOLES IN THE SENSITIZED FILM DRAWS IT DOWNWARD BRINGING A NEW PORTION OF ITS LENGTH IN FRONT OF THE LENS THE FILM THEN REMAINING STATIONARY FOR AN INSTANT
FINALLY THEY SAID THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK
VILLARD WAS A VERY AGGRESSIVE MAN WITH BIG IDEAS BUT I COULD NEVER QUITE UNDERSTAND HIM
IT HAD NOT BURST INTO FLAME AND DIED OUT IMMEDIATELY
IN ONE OF THE LARGER ALCOVES IS A LARGE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE PIVOTED IN ITS SPECIAL STAND TOGETHER WITH A RELIEF MAP OF THE UNITED STATES
WHEREAS TWO SIMILAR LAMPS IF INTRODUCED IN PARALLEL OR MULTIPLE ARC GAVE THE LIGHT OF ONLY 6 1/2 BURNERS IN ALL
THE REASONS FOR SUCH PRODIGIOUS RESEARCH ARE NOT APPARENT ON THE FACE OF THE SUBJECT NOR IS THIS THE OCCASION TO ENTER INTO AN EXPLANATION AS THAT ALONE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO FILL A FAIR-SIZED BOOK
MAY 9 1872 131,342 PRINTING TELEGRAPHS
EVEN THE COMMENT OF A CYNIC IN REGARD TO ELECTRICAL DEVELOPMENT MAY BE ACCEPTED
ANY ACCOUNT OF EDISON'S WORK ON THE DYNAMO WOULD BE INCOMPLETE DID IT OMIT TO RELATE HIS CONCEPTION AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE GREAT DIRECT-CONNECTED STEAM-DRIVEN GENERATOR THAT WAS THE PROTOTYPE OF THE COLOSSAL UNITS WHICH ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO-DAY
IT WAS IN HIS MACHINE ALSO THAT MICA WAS USED FOR THE FIRST TIME AS AN INSULATING MEDIUM IN A COMMUTATOR
SOON AFTER THEY ENTERED THE WATER THE OTHER BOY DISAPPEARED
AFTER I BECAME A TELEGRAPH OPERATOR HE SAYS I PRACTICED FOR A LONG TIME TO BECOME A RAPID READER OF PRINT AND GOT SO EXPERT I COULD SENSE THE MEANING OF A WHOLE LINE AT ONCE
IT IS ONLY WHEN SPECIALLY PREPARED IRON OXIDE OF EXCEEDING FINENESS AND NICKEL HYDRATE CONFORMING TO CERTAIN PHYSICAL AS WELL AS CHEMICAL STANDARDS CAN BE MADE THAT THE ALKALINE BATTERY IS PRACTICABLE
THE CONTRAST IN THIS RESPECT BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR EUROPEAN COLLEAGUES IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT
SO THIS MAN--IT WAS I--WAS SENT FOR TO COME TO NEW YORK AND ASSUAGE THEIR GRIEF IF POSSIBLE
FROM THIS FACT IT IS QUITE APPARENT THAT THEY PLACED NO CREDENCE ON ITS BONA FIDES
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR A MAN OF SUCH MERCURIAL RESTLESS TEMPERAMENT TO STAY CONSTANT TO ANY ONE OCCUPATION
THIS SLENDER FRAGILE TENUOUS THREAD OF BRITTLE CARBON GLOWING STEADILY AND CONTINUOUSLY WITH A SOFT LIGHT AGREEABLE TO THE EYES WAS THE TINY KEY THAT OPENED THE DOOR TO A WORLD REVOLUTIONIZED IN ITS INTERIOR ILLUMINATION
HE WAS VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT THE SUBJECT
THE TELEGRAPH WAS STILL UNDER MILITARY CONTROL NOT HAVING BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE ORIGINAL OWNERS THE SOUTHERN TELEGRAPH COMPANY
THE TRAIN REACHED MONTREAL FOUR DAYS LATE
HERE STRENUOUSNESS IS EXPECTED
AT THE SAME TIME MR EDISON ANNOUNCED THE COMMERCIAL NECESSITY OF HAVING THE ARMATURE OF THE DYNAMO OF LOW RESISTANCE AS COMPARED WITH THE EXTERNAL RESISTANCE IN ORDER THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY DEVELOPED SHOULD BE UTILIZED IN THE LAMPS AND ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE LOST IN THE ARMATURE ALBEIT THIS PROCEDURE REDUCED THE TOTAL GENERATING CAPACITY OF THE MACHINE
A FEW YEARS LATER IN 1878 EDISON WENT TO WYOMING WITH A GROUP OF ASTRONOMERS TO TEST HIS TASIMETER DURING AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN AND SAW THE LAND WHITE TO HARVEST
IN THE BULLETIN OF THE BERLIN ELECTRICITY WORKS FOR MAY 1908 IT IS SAID WITH REGARD TO THE EVENTS THAT LED UP TO THE CREATION OF THE SYSTEM AS NOTED ALREADY AT THE RATHENAU CELEBRATION
CERTAINLY LESS
BUT THE BUSINESS WAS FORTUNATELY SMALL AT THE OUTSET UNTIL THE NEW DEVICE PATRONIZED CHIEFLY BY LOTTERY-MEN HAD PROVED ITS UTILITY
UPON DEPRESSING ANY ONE OF THESE KEYS THE MOTION OF THE CYLINDER IS ARRESTED WHEN ONE OF ITS PINS IS CAUGHT AND HELD BY THE DEPRESSED KEY
I USED TO OPEN THE CORRESPONDENCE AND ANSWER IT ALL SOMETIMES SIGNING EDISON'S NAME WITH MY INITIAL AND SOMETIMES SIGNING MY OWN NAME
IT WAS PROPOSED TO EMPLOY POLE-LINE CONSTRUCTION WITH OVERHEAD WIRES AND A PARTY OF EDISON ENGINEERS DROVE ABOUT THE TOWN IN AN OPEN BAROUCHE WITH A BLUE-PRINT OF THE CIRCUITS AND STREETS SPREAD OUT ON THEIR KNEES TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH TREE-TRIMMING WOULD BE NECESSARY
EDISON LAUGHED AND SAID THAT HE WOULD ASSUME THE RISK AND ANOTHER POINT WAS SETTLED
A CHALK CYLINDER MOISTENED WITH A CHEMICAL SOLUTION WAS REVOLVED BY HAND OR A SMALL MOTOR
IN AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL ARTICLE IN THE ELECTRICAL WORLD OF MARCH 5 1904 HE SAYS
NEVERTHELESS IN WRITING A BIOGRAPHY OF EDISON THE MAIN OBJECT IS TO PRESENT THE FACTS AS THEY ARE AND LEAVE IT TO THE INTELLIGENT READER TO CLASSIFY APPLY AND ANALYZE THEM IN SUCH MANNER AS APPEALS MOST FORCIBLY TO HIS INTELLECTUAL PROCESSES
TOWARD THE END OF MY STAY IN BOSTON HE SAYS I OBTAINED A LOAN OF MONEY AMOUNTING TO $800 TO BUILD A PECULIAR KIND OF DUPLEX TELEGRAPH FOR SENDING TWO MESSAGES OVER A SINGLE WIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY
1 THERE IS ILLUSTRATED PARTLY IN SECTION THE FORM OF TASIMETER WHICH EDISON TOOK WITH HIM TO RAWLINS WYOMING IN JULY 1878 ON THE EXPEDITION TO OBSERVE THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN
THEY LACKED CONFIDENCE OR DID NOT CARE TO INCREASE THEIR INVESTMENTS
THE MATERIAL HAVING THUS BEEN GREATLY RAISED IN TEMPERATURE BEFORE REACHING THE COMBUSTION ZONE WOULD HAVE PARTED WITH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ITS CARBON DIOXIDE AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT INTRODUCE INTO THE COMBUSTION ZONE SUFFICIENT OF THAT GAS TO DISTURB THE PERFECT CHARACTER OF THE COMBUSTION
AND ALL ABOUT THE TOPICAL DOINGS AS WELL AS THE PRICES OF BREADSTUFFS IN ALL THE PRIMARY MARKETS
WHEN HE HAD COMPLETED HIS EXPERIMENT ALL INTEREST IN IT WAS LOST AND THE JARS AND WIRES WOULD BE LEFT TO ANY FATE THAT MIGHT BEFALL THEM
AT JERSEY CITY A POKER GAME WAS STARTED BY ONE OF THE DELEGATES
THE NEXT MAN THAT DOES IT I WILL KILL HIM THEY PAID NO ATTENTION TO THIS AND NEXT DAY ONE OF THEM MADE SOME SARCASTIC REMARK TO HIM
THENCE HANINGTON WENT BY STEAMER TO MONTEVIDEO AND BY SIMILAR CONVEYANCE UP THE RIVER DE LA PLATA AND THROUGH URUGUAY ARGENTINE AND PARAGUAY TO THE SOUTHERNMOST PART OF BRAZIL COLLECTING A LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS OF PALMS AND GRASSES
CHLOROFORM NITROUS OXIDE GAS AND ETHER HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE SERVICE OF THE PHYSICIAN IN SAVING LIFE AND THE REVOLVER GUNCOTTON AND NITROGLYCERINE ADDED TO THE AGENCIES FOR SLAUGHTER
HE DOESN'T GET MAD WHEN HE MISSES THEM BUT JUST KEEPS ON SMILING AND FIRING AND USUALLY BRINGS THEM INTO CAMP
THESE IMPULSES ACCORDING TO BELL'S THEORY CORRESPOND IN FORM TO THE SOUND-WAVES AND PASSING OVER THE LINE ENERGIZE THE MAGNET COIL AT THE RECEIVING END AND BY VARYING THE MAGNETISM CAUSE THE RECEIVING DIAPHRAGM TO BE SIMILARLY VIBRATED TO REPRODUCE THE SOUNDS
HE WAS A HIGHLY INTELLECTUAL MAN AND I LOVED TO TALK TO HIM
AFTER CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE WE STARTED TO INTERVIEW THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR AT THIS MOST LONELY AND DESOLATE SPOT
HE GOT A QUART OF ETHER AND STARTED TO BOIL IT OVER A NAKED FLAME
MANY OF THESE PIONEER STUDENTS AND WORKMEN BECAME AFTERWARD LARGE AND SUCCESSFUL CONTRACTORS OR HAVE FILLED POSITIONS OF DISTINCTION AS MANAGERS AND SUPERINTENDENTS OF CENTRAL STATIONS

THE ORANGE LABORATORY AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED CONSISTED OF A MAIN BUILDING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET LONG AND THREE STORIES IN HEIGHT TOGETHER WITH FOUR OTHER STRUCTURES EACH ONE HUNDRED BY TWENTY-FIVE FEET AND ONLY ONE STORY IN HEIGHT
THESE FIGURES PROVE THAT THE YIELD OF THE FURNACE IS CONSIDERABLY INCREASED
THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE STARTED A LITTLE SMALLER UNTIL HE WAS SURE
THE SEWING-MACHINE HAD BROUGHT WITH IT LIKE THE FRICTION MATCH ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND INFLUENCES IN MODIFYING DOMESTIC LIFE AND MAKING IT DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ALL PRECEDING TIME
THE EQUIPMENT OF AN OPERATOR ON A CAR WAS QUITE SIMPLE CONSISTING MERELY OF A SMALL LAP-BOARD ON WHICH WERE MOUNTED THE KEY COIL AND BUZZER LEAVING ROOM FOR TELEGRAPH BLANKS
BLAINE'S NIECE GAIL HAMILTON
IN EUROPE THE TELEGRAPH SYSTEMS ARE ALL UNDER GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT THE OPERATORS HAVE STRICTLY LIMITED SPHERES OF PROMOTION AND AT THE BEST THE TRANSITION FROM ONE KIND OF EMPLOYMENT TO ANOTHER IS NOT MADE SO EASILY AS IN THE NEW WORLD
IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE INCANDESCENT LAMP WHICH WAS ACCEPTED AT THE TIME AS A STANDARD AND HAS SO REMAINED TO THE PRESENT DAY WAS A LAMP OF 110 VOLTS OR THEREABOUTS

1 AND 2 ARE MAIN CONDUCTORS FROM WHICH 110-VOLT LAMPS L ARE TAKEN IN DERIVED CIRCUITS
22 1900 1901 700,136 REVERSIBLE GALVANIC BATTERY
AND TO SOME READERS IT MAY SEEM INCOMPLETE IN ITS REFERENCES TO THE WORK OF OTHER MEN THAN EDISON WHOSE INFLUENCE ON TELEPHONY AS AN ART HAS ALSO BEEN CONSIDERABLE
IN THIS MANNER A GOOD DEAL OF CAPITAL AND THE ENERGIES OF MANY PROMINENT MEN IN POLITICS AND BUSINESS HAD BEEN RALLIED DISTINCTIVELY TO THE SUPPORT OF ARC LIGHTING
THE RED LAVA OF DEEP REVOLUTIONARY FIRES OOZED UP THROUGH MANY GLOWING CRACKS IN THE POLITICAL CRUST AND ALL THE SOCIAL STRATA WERE SHAKEN
IN SOME MANNER TWO WIRES HAD GOT CROSSED WITH THIS TINSEL WHICH BECAME RED-HOT AND THE WHOLE MASS WAS SOON AFIRE
IT IS DIFFICULT TO GIVE ANY COMPLETE IDEA OF THE ACTIVITY MAINTAINED AT THE NEWARK SHOPS DURING THESE ANXIOUS HARASSED YEARS BUT THE STATEMENT THAT AT ONE TIME NO FEWER THAN FORTY-FIVE DIFFERENT INVENTIONS WERE BEING WORKED UPON WILL FURNISH SOME NOTION OF THE INCANDESCENT ACTIVITY OF THE INVENTOR AND HIS ASSISTANTS
COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGES OF LIGHT WEIGHT
MR MCGOWAN TO EXPLORE ON FOOT AND BY CANOE IN PERU ECUADOR AND COLOMBIA WHILE MR HANINGTON RETURNED BY THE AMAZON RIVER TO PARA
WITH OTHERS WHO HAVE GIVEN MUCH ATTENTION TO THIS REMARKABLE REED I BELIEVE THAT IN ITS MANIFOLD USES THE BAMBOO IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST DENDRAL BENEFACTOR
THIS WAS BASED UPON THE PRINCIPLE THAT A SOUND PRODUCED IN THE PRESENCE OF A REED OR TUNING-FORK RESPONDING TO THE SOUND AND ACTING AS THE ARMATURE OF A MAGNET IN A CLOSED CIRCUIT WOULD BY INDUCTION SET UP ELECTRIC IMPULSES IN THE CIRCUIT AND CAUSE A DISTANT MAGNET HAVING A SIMILARLY TUNED ARMATURE TO PRODUCE THE SAME TONE OR NOTE
EDISON NOT ONLY RECOGNIZED AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE PRINCIPLES HE HAD DISCOVERED BUT IN ADAPTING THEM FOR COMMERCIAL USE DEVELOPED MOST INGENIOUS PROCESSES AND MECHANICAL APPLIANCES FOR CARRYING HIS DISCOVERIES INTO PRACTICAL EFFECT
THE PRINCIPAL USE THAT EDISON HAS HAD IN MIND FOR HIS BATTERY IS TRANSPORTATION OF FREIGHT AND PASSENGERS BY TRUCK AUTOMOBILE AND STREET-CAR
BEING THE TEACHER TO WHOM REFERENCE IS MADE I AM NOW QUITE WILLING TO CONFESS THAT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THAT AFTERNOON LESS THAN A PROBLEM IN EUCLID WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO DISQUALIFY ME FOR THE REMAINING SCHOLASTIC DUTIES OF THE HOUR
BY REASON OF ITS VIBRATIONS THIS DIAPHRAGM INDUCES VERY WEAK ELECTRIC IMPULSES IN THE MAGNETIC COIL
IT WAS AS THOUGH A ROCK OF THIS SIZE HAD GOT IN THE WAY OF TWO EXPRESS TRAINS TRAVELLING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AT NEARLY SIXTY MILES AN HOUR
VAIL FORMERLY ONE OF THE MENLO PARK STAFF
APPARENTLY OBLIVIOUS TO EVERYTHING ELSE HE WILL LISTEN WITH CONCENTRATED MIND AND CLOSE ATTENTION AND THEN POUR FORTH A PERFECT TORRENT OF IDEAS AND PLANS AND IF THE OCCASION CALLS FOR IT WILL TURN AROUND TO THE TABLE SEIZE A WRITING-PAD AND MAKE SKETCH AFTER SKETCH WITH LIGHTNING-LIKE RAPIDITY TEARING OFF EACH SHEET AS FILLED AND TOSSING IT ASIDE TO THE FLOOR
THERE WAS NO SCENERY TO RENDER GAY THIS LUGUBRIOUS ENVIRONMENT BUT THE BLACK INTERIOR SERVED AS THE COMMON BACKGROUND FOR THE PERFORMERS THROWING ALL THEIR ACTIONS INTO HIGH RELIEF
I FELT IT OF COURSE TO BE NO SMALL HONOR FOR A HUMBLE TEACHER TO BE CALLED TO THE SANCTUM OF THOMAS A
NOT TO HIM EVEN WHO DROPS AN ORIGINAL SUGGESTION BUT TO HIM WHO FIRST MAKES THAT SUGGESTION FRUITFUL OF RESULTS
HARRINGTON AND REIFF WHO OWNED WITH EDISON THE FOREIGN PATENTS FOR THE NEW AUTOMATIC SYSTEM ENTERED INTO AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE BRITISH POSTAL TELEGRAPH AUTHORITIES FOR A TRIAL OF THE SYSTEM IN ENGLAND INVOLVING ITS PROBABLE ADOPTION IF SUCCESSFUL

SO LONG AS THE ACTION IS CONTINUED THESE MOVEMENTS ARE REPEATED RESULTING IN A SUCCESSION OF ENORMOUSLY RAPID EXPOSURES UPON THE FILM DURING ITS PROGRESS FROM REEL H<1S> TO ITS AUTOMATIC REWINDING ON REEL H<2S> WHILE THE FILM IS PASSING THROUGH THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE MACHINE IT IS GUIDED AND KEPT STRAIGHT BY VARIOUS SETS OF ROLLERS BETWEEN WHICH IT RUNS AS INDICATED IN THE DIAGRAM
WHILE HIS ACHIEVEMENT IN ITS PRESENT STATUS WILL BRING ABOUT SUBSTANTIAL AND IMMEDIATE BENEFITS TO WAGE-EARNERS HIS THOUGHTS HAVE ALREADY TRAVELLED SOME YEARS AHEAD IN THE FORMULATION OF A STILL FURTHER BENEFICIAL PROJECT LOOKING TOWARD THE INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP OF THESE HOUSES ON A BASIS STARTLING IN ITS PRACTICAL POSSIBILITIES
THE COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF SEPARATE EXPERIMENTS RECORDED EXHIBIT THE OPERATIONS OF A MASTER MIND SEEKING TO SURPRISE NATURE INTO A BETRAYAL OF HER SECRETS BY ASKING HER THE SAME QUESTION IN A HUNDRED DIFFERENT WAYS
THE HOURS OF WORK OF A NIGHT OPERATOR ARE USUALLY FROM 7 P.M
IN PRACTICE THE CHALK DRUM WAS ELECTRICALLY CONNECTED WITH ONE POLE OF AN INCOMING TELEGRAPH CIRCUIT AND THE VIBRATING ARM AND PAD WITH THE OTHER POLE
SLOWLY BUT SURELY THE RESULTS OF THE LAST FEW THOUSANDS OF HIS PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS HAD POINTED INEVITABLY TO A NEW AND FRUITFUL REGION AHEAD
IT MAY BE RETARDED
MR EDISON'S OWN WORDS MAY BE QUOTED AS TO THE MEN WITH WHOM HE SURROUNDED HIMSELF HERE AND UPON WHOSE SERVICES HE DEPENDED PRINCIPALLY FOR HELP IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HIS AIMS
IT MAY BE OCCASIONALLY THAT THE EXIGENCIES OF THE OCCASION REQUIRE THE WORK OF A PERFORMING HORSE DOG OR OTHER ANIMAL
I PUT ON A FRESH FOIL AND TOLD HIM TO GO AHEAD
LOWREY HENRY VILLARD ROBERT L
POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTIMISM AS REVEALED IN INVENTION--THE SEEKING A HIGHER GOOD--NEEDS SOME CHECK
IN HIS CENTRAL-STATION WORK EDISON HAS HAD VERY MUCH THIS KIND OF EXPERIENCE
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF ELECTRICITY IS USED FOR LIGHT OR FOR POWER
THE POSITIVE FILM IS MOVED INTERMITTENTLY BUT SWIFTLY THROUGHOUT ITS LENGTH BETWEEN THE OBJECTIVE LENS AND A BEAM OF LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE CONDENSER BEING EXPOSED BY THE SHUTTER DURING THE PERIODS OF REST
THERE WERE ALSO TO BE REGARDED AS DETACHED MEMBERS OF IT THE BERGMANN BROTHERS MANUFACTURING FOR MR EDISON IN NEW YORK AND INCESSANTLY EXPERIMENTING FOR HIM
PASSING NOW TO THE TOP FLOOR THE VISITOR FINDS HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF A BROAD HALL RUNNING ALMOST THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE BUILDING AND LINED MOSTLY WITH GLASS-FRONTED CABINETS CONTAINING A MULTITUDE OF EXPERIMENTAL INCANDESCENT LAMPS AND AN IMMENSE VARIETY OF MODELS OF PHONOGRAPHS MOTORS TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE APPARATUS METERS AND A HOST OF OTHER INVENTIONS UPON WHICH EDISON'S ENERGIES HAVE AT ONE TIME AND ANOTHER BEEN BENT
BERGMANN MAINTAINED THAT HE MUST BE MISTAKEN
MARCH 13,1908 947,806 AUTOMOBILES
EVEN THE CALL-WORD OF THE TELEPHONE HELLO SENT TINGLING OVER THE WIRE A FEW MILLION TIMES DAILY WAS TAKEN FROM MENLO PARK BY MEN INSTALLING TELEPHONES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD MEN WHO HAD JUST LEARNED IT AT THE LABORATORY AND THUS MADE IT A UNIVERSAL SESAME FOR TELEPHONIC CONVERSATION
AMONG THE COMPLEX AND NUMEROUS PROBLEMS THAT PRESENTED THEMSELVES IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE BATTERY WAS THE ONE CONCERNING THE INTERNAL CONDUCTIVITY OF THE POSITIVE UNIT
I ASKED HIS ADVICE AS TO WHAT I SHOULD ORDER TO WHICH HE REPLIED
HIS DRESS IS ALWAYS OF THE PLAINEST
THERE WAS ONLY ONE LITTLE INN NEAR BY FREQUENTED BY LONGSHOREMEN AND EMPLOYEES FROM THE SOAP-WORKS AND CEMENT-FACTORIES--A ROUGH LOT--AND THERE AT DAYBREAK THEY WENT AS SOON AS THE OTHER CUSTOMERS HAD LEFT FOR WORK
EDISON'S PHONOPLEX NORMALLY DOUBLED THE CAPACITY OF TELEGRAPH LINES WHETHER EMPLOYED ON WAY BUSINESS OR THROUGH TRAFFIC BUT IN ACTUAL PRACTICE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN MORE THAN DOUBLE SERVICE
THE ELECTRICAL GENIUS OF NEWARK IS EDWARD WESTON WHO HAS THRIVEN AMID ITS TURMOIL AND THERE HAS DEVELOPED HIS BEAUTIFUL INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION
ABOUT EVERY BOY INCLUDING MYSELF WENT OVER TO SEE THE AFFAIR
ALL OF THE TECHNICAL EXPERT AND PROFESSIONAL SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE THAT MONEY COULD PROCURE OR EXPERIENCE DEVISE WERE AVAILED OF IN THE BITTER FIGHTS THAT RAGED IN THE COURTS FOR MANY YEARS

I DON'T LIVE WITH THE PAST
IN ALL THIS THE EDISONS SHARED ON EQUAL TERMS
BY USING AN INCISOR OF THIS SORT THE RECORD IS FORMED OF A SERIES OF CONNECTED GOUGES WITH ROUNDED SIDES VARYING IN DEPTH AND WIDTH AND WITH WHICH THE REPRODUCER AUTOMATICALLY ENGAGES AND MAINTAINS ITS ENGAGEMENT
THE SAME WINTER OF 1863-64 WHILE AT PORT HURON EDISON HAD A FURTHER OPPORTUNITY OF DISPLAYING HIS INGENUITY
ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS NEVER MORE ACTIVE THAN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WORK WE HAVE SUMMED UP AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CHAPTER
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO HE WOUNDED HIS DAUGHTER AND SHOT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD BECOME RUINED FINANCIALLY
THE SANCTIMONIOUS HYPOCRITE THE SLEEK SPECULATOR AND OTHERS WHOM HE HAS PROBABLY ENCOUNTERED IN LIFE ARE DONE TO THE QUEEN'S TASTE ONE VERY COLD WINTER'S DAY HE ENTERED THE LABORATORY LIBRARY IN FINE SPIRITS DOING THE DECAYED DANDY WITH IMAGINARY CANE UNDER HIS ARM STRUGGLING TO PUT ON A PAIR OF TATTERED IMAGINARY GLOVES WITH A SELF-SATISFIED SMIRK AND LEER THAT WOULD HAVE DONE CREDIT TO A REAL COMEDIAN
THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPHY ARE BASED UPON THE PHENOMENA WHICH WE HAVE BRIEFLY OUTLINED IN CONNECTION WITH THE NEUTRAL RELAY AND THE POLAR RELAY
IN THIS PEARL STREET INSTANCE THE BUILDING ERECTED ORIGINALLY FOR COMMERCIAL USES WAS QUITE INCAPABLE OF SUSTAINING THE WEIGHT OF THE HEAVY DYNAMOS AND STEAM-ENGINES TO BE INSTALLED ON THE SECOND FLOOR
IN LOOKING BACK ON THOSE DAYS AND SCRUTINIZING THEM THROUGH THE YEARS I AM IMPRESSED BY THE GREATNESS THE SOLITARY GREATNESS I MAY SAY OF MR EDISON
HAVING TRAVELLED AROUND THE WORLD I HAD CULTIVATED AN INDIFFERENCE TO ANY SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES OF THAT KIND
IN THE FIELD MAGNETS OF HIS DYNAMO HE CONSTRUCTED THE CORES AND YOKE OF FORGED IRON HAVING A VERY LARGE CROSS-SECTION WHICH WAS A NEW THING IN THOSE DAYS
I REMEMBER ONE TIME THINGS LOOKED SO DARK TO ME THAT I HAD JUST ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND TO THROW UP MY JOB BUT SOME GOOD TURN CAME JUST THEN AND I DIDN'T
HE WAS AN ENGLISHMAN AND CAME TO THIS COUNTRY TO SET UP THE THREAD-WEAVING MACHINERY FOR THE CLARK THREAD-WORKS
POSSIBLY THE ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY MAY NOT NOW ATTRACT AS MUCH ADVENTUROUS GENIUS AS IT DID THEN FOR AUTOMOBILES AERONAUTICS AND OTHER NEW ARTS HAVE COME TO THE FRONT IN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY TO ENLIST THE ENTHUSIASM OF A YOUNGER GENERATION OF MERCURIAL SPIRITS
I HELD HIS POWER OF ATTORNEY AND SIGNED HIS CHECKS
EDWARD LAUTERBACH WAS CONNECTED WITH THE THIRD AVENUE RAILROAD IN NEW YORK--AS COUNSEL--AND I TOLD HIM HE WAS MAKING A HORRIBLE MISTAKE PUTTING IN THE CABLE

THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE WITNESSED A REMARKABLE ADVANCE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF INCANDESCENT LAMPS IN THE SUBSTITUTION OF METALLIC FILAMENTS FOR THOSE OF CARBON
A DEVICE FOR SEALING TOGETHER THE INSIDE PART AND BULB OF AN INCANDESCENT LAMP MECHANICALLY
BUT THE POOL PERSEVERED IN ITS EFFORT TO CORNER GOLD WITH A PROFIT OF MANY MILLIONS CONTINGENT ON SUCCESS
THAT IS WHAT I GET FOR PUTTING SO MUCH MONEY IN A NEW SUIT WAS THE LACONIC REMARK OF THE YOUTH WHO WAS MORE THAN DELIGHTED TO PICK UP A COMPLETE SET OF FARADAY'S WORKS ABOUT THE SAME TIME
THAT WHICH THE UBIQUITOUS STOCK TICKER HAS DONE IS TO GIVE INSTANTANEITY TO THE NEWS OF WHAT THE STOCK MARKET IS DOING SO THAT AT EVERY MINUTE THOUSANDS OF MILES APART BROKERS INVESTORS AND GAMBLERS MAY LEARN THE EXACT CONDITIONS
SO I WENT THERE AND SPENT TWO OR THREE DAYS TELLING HIM STORIES
I GOT UP A SLOT CONTACT FOR STREET RAILWAYS AND HAVE A PATENT ON IT--A SLIDING CONTACT IN A SLOT
AT THE PHILADELPHIA CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION OF 1876 WALLACE-FARMER DYNAMOS BUILT AT ANSONIA CONNECTICUT WERE SHOWN WITH THE CURRENT FROM WHICH ARC LAMPS WERE THERE PUT IN ACTUAL SERVICE
HOW EXTENSIVE THIS BUSINESS HAS BECOME MAY BE APPRECIATED WHEN IT IS STATED THAT AT THE ORANGE PLANT THERE ARE PRODUCED AT THIS TIME OVER EIGHT MILLION FEET OF MOTION-PICTURE FILM PER YEAR
WITH AN ICONOCLASM THAT HAS OFTEN SEEMED RUTHLESS AND BRUTAL HE DID NOT HESITATE TO SACRIFICE OLDER DEVICES THE MOMENT A NEW ONE CAME IN SIGHT THAT EMBODIED A REAL ADVANCE IN SECURING EFFECTIVE RESULTS
IN OTHER WORDS HE BECOMES AN INVENTOR BY PROFESSION
HIS REASONING LED HIM TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS RESULT COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF A KILN OF COMPARATIVELY GREAT LENGTH AND HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ENABLED HIM TO DECIDE UPON A LENGTH OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET BUT WITH AN INCREASE IN DIAMETER OF ONLY SIX INCHES TO A FOOT OVER THAT OF THE SIXTY-FOOT KILN
BUT AMONG ALL THE BAMBOOS OF CHINA I FOUND NONE OF SUPEREXCELLENCE IN CARBONIZING QUALITIES
HE WENT HOME AND SHORTLY HIS MOTHER APPEARED AT THE LABORATORY WITH A HORSEWHIP WHICH SHE PROPOSED TO USE ON THE PROPRIETOR
THE ONLY APPEARANCE THEY MADE WAS TO DRAW THEIR PAY SATURDAY AFTERNOON JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS IN 1880--DECEMBER 17--AS AN ITEM FOR THE SILK STOCKING OF FATHER KNICKERBOCKER--THE EDISON ELECTRIC ILLUMINATING COMPANY OF NEW YORK WAS ORGANIZED
THESE WERE ARRANGED CAREFULLY ON SHELVES AND ALL LABELLED POISON SO THAT NO ONE ELSE WOULD HANDLE OR DISTURB THEM
TO ATTRIBUTE DISHONESTY OR CUPIDITY AS THE ROOT OF THE DEFENCE IN ALL PATENT LITIGATION WOULD BE AIMING VERY WIDE OF THE MARK FOR IN NO CLASS OF SUITS THAT COME BEFORE THE COURTS ARE THERE ANY THAT PRESENT A GREATER VARIETY OF COMPLEX FINELY SHADED QUESTIONS OR THAT REQUIRE MORE DELICACY OF INTERPRETATION THAN THOSE THAT INVOLVE THE CONSTRUCTION OF PATENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO ELECTRICAL DEVICES
BUT IT STOOD SERIOUSLY IN THE WAY OF SATISFYING THE EVER-PRESENT CRAVING FOR A LABORATORY
VANDERBILT CAME TO 65 SAW THE LIGHT AND DECIDED THAT HE WOULD HAVE HIS NEW HOUSE LIGHTED WITH IT
OR THAN THE INCREASE IN ITS MANUFACTURE HERE
IT WILL REQUIRE A GREATER INITIAL BATTERY TO BRING AN IRON WIRE OF THE SAME SIZE AND RESISTANCE TO A GIVEN TEMPERATURE THAN IT WILL A PLATINA WIRE IN PROPORTION TO THEIR SPECIFIC HEATS AND IN THE CASE OF CARBON A PIECE OF CARBON THREE INCHES LONG AND ONE-EIGHTH DIAMETER WITH A RESISTANCE OF 1 OHM WILL REQUIRE A GREATER BATTERY POWER TO BRING IT TO A GIVEN TEMPERATURE THAN A CYLINDER OF THIN PLATINA FOIL OF THE SAME LENGTH DIAMETER AND RESISTANCE BECAUSE THE SPECIFIC HEAT OF CARBON IS MANY TIMES GREATER
PREECE ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT ELECTRICIANS IN ENGLAND WHO AFTER DISCUSSING THE QUESTION MATHEMATICALLY SAID
THE RIVER IS THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE WIDE AND COULD NOT BE CROSSED ON FOOT
BESIDES THE ABOVE-NAMED 41,000,000 INCANDESCENT LAMPS CONNECTED TO THEIR MAINS THERE ARE ABOUT 500,000 ARC LAMPS AND 150,000 MOTORS USING 750,000 HORSE-POWER BESIDES COUNTLESS FAN MOTORS AND ELECTRIC HEATING AND COOKING APPLIANCES
YOU MUST ALLOW FOR MY YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM BUT YOU MUST ALSO BEAR IN MIND EDISON'S PECULIAR GIFT OF MAGNETISM WHICH HAS ENABLED HIM DURING HIS CAREER TO ATTACH SO MANY MEN TO HIM
HE ALSO OWNED A GOOD FARM NEAR THAT TOWN AND DURING THE ILL-HEALTH AT THE CLOSE OF HIS LIFE WHEN COMPELLED TO SPEND MUCH OF THE TIME INDOORS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF ALMOST ENTIRELY TO SKETCHING
FIFTH--TO DEVISE MEANS FOR MAINTAINING AT ALL POINTS IN AN EXTENDED AREA OF DISTRIBUTION A PRACTICALLY EVEN PRESSURE OF CURRENT SO THAT ALL THE LAMPS WHEREVER LOCATED NEAR OR FAR AWAY FROM THE CENTRAL STATION SHOULD GIVE AN EQUAL LIGHT AT ALL TIMES INDEPENDENT OF THE NUMBER THAT MIGHT BE TURNED ON
HIS INQUIRIES WERE DIRECTED ALONG ALL THE VARIOUS ROADS LEADING TO THE DESIRED GOAL FOR LONG BEFORE HE HAD COMPLETED THE INVENTION OF A PRACTICAL LAMP HE REALIZED BROADLY THE FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL SYSTEM OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION AND HAD GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MAKING OF A GREAT VARIETY OF CALCULATIONS WHICH ALTHOUGH FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE TIME WERE CLEARLY FORESEEN BY HIM TO BE VITALLY IMPORTANT IN THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION OF THE COMPLICATED PROBLEM
ON BLACK FRIDAY HE SAYS WE HAD A VERY EXCITING TIME WITH THE INDICATORS
BEING ASKED WHETHER HE DID NOT GET IMPOSED UPON WITH BAD BANK-BILLS HE REPLIED THAT HE SUBSCRIBED TO A BANK-NOTE DETECTOR AND CONSULTED IT CLOSELY WHENEVER A NOTE OF ANY SIZE FELL INTO HIS HANDS
THIS IS A DIRIGIBLE SUBMARINE TORPEDO OPERATED BY ELECTRICITY
THIS INCLUDED THE DEDICATORY SPEECH OF GOVERNOR HUGHES OF NEW YORK
I PUT THE LARGE BULK OF IT IN THREE FILTERS AND AFTER IT HAD BEEN WASHED AND ALL THE WATER HAD COME THROUGH THE FILTER I OPENED THE THREE FILTERS AND LAID THEM ON A HOT STEAM PLATE TO DRY WITH THE STUFF
THE SYSTEM EMPLOYED WAS NATURALLY THE TWO-WIRE AS AT THAT TIME THE THREE-WIRE HAD NOT BEEN THOUGHT OF
IN VIEW OF THIS IMMENSE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT AND LABOR MY SYMPATHY GOT THE BETTER OF MY JUDGMENT AND I SAID
HAMMER WHO SUPPLIES SOME VERY INTERESTING NOTES ON THE INSTALLATION SAYS
EDISON'S CONNECTION WITH THIS PARTICULAR DEVICE WAS VERY CLOSE WHILE IT LASTED
162,633 APRIL 27 1875 THE QUADRUPLEX WAS THE TEMPTING GOAL TOWARD WHICH EDISON NOW CONSTANTLY TURNED AND AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR'S STRENUOUS WORK HE FILED A NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS IN THE LATE SUMMER OF 1874
THE OTHER LAD PROPOSED SEEKING SAFETY UP A TREE BUT EDISON DEMURRED ON THE PLEA THAT BEARS COULD CLIMB AND THAT THE MESSAGE MUST BE DELIVERED THAT NIGHT TO ENABLE THE CAPTAIN TO CATCH THE MORNING TRAIN
THEY WERE IN NO PROPER SENSE THE PRACTICAL COMMERCIAL LAMP OF EDISON
WHILE THIS SYSTEM OF OILING IS NOT UNIQUE IT WAS THE FIRST INSTANCE OF ITS ADAPTATION ON SO LARGE AND COMPLETE A SCALE AND ILLUSTRATES THE FAR-SIGHTEDNESS OF HIS PLANS
OF COURSE WE ALL REMEMBER HOW THE BATTERY WAS COMPLETED AND PUT ON THE MARKET
NO SIR
THIS PROVISION EVEN INCLUDED THE DETAILS OF THE PACKING-HOUSE AND HIS PERSPICACITY IN THIS CASE IS WELL SUSTAINED FROM THE FACT THAT NINE YEARS AFTERWARD IN ANTICIPATION OF BUILDING AN ADDITIONAL PACKING-HOUSE THE COMPANY SENT A REPRESENTATIVE TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO EXAMINE THE SYSTEMS USED BY MANUFACTURERS IN THE PACKING OF LARGE QUANTITIES OF VARIOUS STAPLE COMMODITIES INVOLVING SOMEWHAT SIMILAR PROBLEMS AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS NONE BETTER THAN THAT DEVISED BEFORE THE CEMENT PLANT WAS STARTED
THE SAME JOURNAL IN ITS ISSUE OF APRIL 1 1896 SHOWS AN EDISON FLUOROSCOPE IN USE BY AN OBSERVER IN THE NOW FAMILIAR AND UNIVERSAL FORM SOMEWHAT LIKE A STEREOSCOPE
THEN WENT TO ENGLAND TO RAISE MONEY FOR A RAILROAD IN CAPE COLONY
THE PRESS MATTER CAME RIGHT ALONG AND HE COULD NOT STOP IT
DU MONCEL A DISTINGUISHED ELECTRICIAN WHO HAD WRITTEN CYNICALLY ABOUT EDISON'S WORK AND DENIED ITS PRACTICABILITY
EDISON WAS TO BE FOUND AT THE OFFICE BOTH DAY AND NIGHT SLEEPING THERE
HENCE IT REQUIRES A COMPLETE REARRANGEMENT OF MENTAL CONCEPTIONS TO APPRECIATE EDISON'S PROPOSAL TO BUILD A HOUSE FROM THE TOP DOWNWARD IN A FEW HOURS WITH A FREELY FLOWING MATERIAL POURED INTO MOLDS AND IN A FEW DAYS TO TAKE AWAY THE MOLDS AND FIND A COMPLETE INDESTRUCTIBLE SANITARY HOUSE INCLUDING FOUNDATION FRAME FLOORS WALLS STAIRWAYS CHIMNEYS SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS AND ROOF WITH ARTISTIC ORNAMENTATION INSIDE AND OUT ALL IN ONE SOLID PIECE AS IF IT WERE GRAVEN OR BORED OUT OF A ROCK
THIS PROBLEM HAD A TWOFOLD ASPECT ALTHOUGH EACH SIDE WAS INSEPARABLY BOUND UP IN THE OTHER
THE NEXT ILLUSTRATION SHOWS A PAIR OF SUCH TELEPHONES CONNECTED FOR USE THE WORKING PARTS ONLY BEING DESIGNATED BY THE ABOVE REFERENCE LETTERS
BUT AS TO ITS IMMEDIATE USE THE INVENTOR SAYS
8 BEARING ALWAYS IN MIND THAT BY REASON OF THE DIFFERENTIAL WINDING OF THE POLAR AND NEUTRAL RELAYS NEITHER OF THE RELAYS AT ONE STATION WILL RESPOND TO THE HOME BATTERY AND CAN ONLY RESPOND TO THE DISTANT BATTERY--THE POLAR RELAY RESPONDING WHEN THE POLARITY OF THE CURRENT IS REVERSED WHETHER THE CURRENT BE STRONG OR WEAK AND THE NEUTRAL RELAY RESPONDING WHEN THE LINE-CURRENT IS INCREASED REGARDLESS OF ITS POLARITY
EACH TUBE IS 1/4 INCH IN DIAMETER BY 4 1/8 INCHES LONG ADD HAS EIGHT OF THE REINFORCING RINGS
THE NEED FOR THEM UNDER MANY CONDITIONS REMAINED AS FOR EXAMPLE IN PLACES IN GREATER NEW YORK WHERE THE OVERHEAD TROLLEY WIRES ARE FORBIDDEN AS OBJECTIONABLE AND WHERE THE GROUND IS TOO WET OR TOO OFTEN SUBMERGED TO PERMIT OF THE CONDUIT WITH THE SLOT
IN THIS WAY WE STUDIED ARMATURE-WINDING AND HAD MATCHES WHERE EACH OF US HAD A CORE WHILE BETS WERE MADE AS TO WHO WOULD BE THE FIRST TO FINISH PROPERLY AND CORRECTLY A CERTAIN KIND OF WINDING
NIGHT CAME BUT THE UNIONISTS WERE CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR ABSENCE ALTHOUGH MORE CIRCUITS THAN ONE WERE INTOLERANT OF DELAY AND CLAMOROUS FOR ATTENTION---EIGHT LOCAL UNIONISTS BEING AWAY
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT HAS BEEN THE BASIS OF MANY INACCURATE STORIES BUT IS DRAMATIC ENOUGH AS TOLD IN MR EDISON'S OWN VERSION

EDISON'S SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM INVOLVED THE PRODUCTION OF A KODAK IN WHICH FROM TWENTY TO FORTY PICTURES SHOULD BE TAKEN IN EACH SECOND AND WITH SUCH FINENESS OF ADJUSTMENT THAT EACH SHOULD EXACTLY COINCIDE WITH ITS PREDECESSORS EVEN WHEN SUBJECTED TO THE TEST OF ENLARGEMENT BY PROJECTION
IT WAS AT SOME CELEBRATION OF ONE OF THE ROYAL SOCIETIES AT THE BURLINGTON HOUSE PICCADILLY

CURIOUSLY ENOUGH WHILE HITHERTO EDISON HAD SOUGHT TO DISSOCIATE HIS EXPERIMENTING FROM HIS MANUFACTURING HERE HE DETERMINED TO DEVELOP A LARGE INDUSTRY TO WHICH A THOROUGHLY PRACTICAL LABORATORY WOULD BE A CENTRAL FEATURE AND EVER A SOURCE OF SUGGESTION AND INSPIRATION
THE OTHER PRINCIPAL FEATURES NECESSARY TO SUBDIVIDE THE ELECTRIC CURRENT SUCCESSFULLY WERE
THUS FOR INSTANCE A JAPANESE HOUSE INTERIOR MAY BE SEEN CHEEK BY JOWL WITH AN ORDINARY PRISON CELL FLANKED BY A MINING-CAMP WHICH IN TURN STANDS NEXT TO A DRAWING-ROOM SET AND IN EACH A SET OF APPROPRIATE CHARACTERS IN PANTOMIMIC MOTION
THE OBJECT OF MY INVENTION IS TO PRODUCE A METHOD FOR THE BREAKING OF ROCK WHICH WILL BE SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE WILL NOT REQUIRE THE HAND-SLEDGING OR BLASTING OF THE ROCK DOWN TO PIECES OF MODERATE SIZE AND WILL INVOLVE THE CONSUMPTION OF A SMALL AMOUNT OF POWER WHILE THIS QUOTATION REFERS TO THE METHOD AS SIMPLE THE PATENT UNDER CONSIDERATION COVERS ONE OF THE MOST BOLD AND DARING PROJECTS THAT EDISON HAS EVER EVOLVED

AND UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE GREAT FARADAY IN 1858 PROTECTING BEAMS OF INTENSE ELECTRIC LIGHT FROM THE VOLTAIC ARC WERE SHED OVER THE WATERS OF THE STRAITS OF DOVER FROM THE BEACONS OF SOUTH FORELAND AND DUNGENESS
CERTAINLY IT IS TOO EASY FOR ME TO UNDERTAKE
IT WAS HOPELESS--AN APPEAL BASED ON SENTIMENT
THEY HAVE NAMED SOME OF THEM
NOTHING EVER CAME OF DUCOS SUGGESTIONS AND THOSE OF THE EARLY DREAMERS IN THIS ESSENTIALLY PRACTICAL AND COMMERCIAL ART AND THEIR IDEAS HAVE MADE NO GREATER IMPRESS UPON THE FINAL RESULT THAN JULES VERNE'S NAUTILUS OF OUR BOYHOOD DAYS HAS DEVELOPED THE MODERN SUBMARINE

ALTHOUGH NOT A STEAM OR MECHANICAL ENGINEER HIS QUICK GRASP OF PRINCIPLES AND OMNIVOROUS READING HAD SOON SUPPLIED THE LACK OF TRAINING
ANOTHER DIFFICULTY ENCOUNTERED IN THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PHONOGRAPH WAS THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE RECORDING STYLUS SO AS TO ENTER THE WAX-LIKE SURFACE TO A VERY SLIGHT DEPTH AND OF THE REPRODUCER SO AS TO ENGAGE EXACTLY THE RECORD WHEN FORMED

CHAPTER XVII OTHER EARLY STATIONS--THE METER WE HAVE NOW SEEN THE EDISON LIGHTING SYSTEM GIVEN A COMPLETE CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION IN PARIS LONDON AND NEW YORK
THE FIRST NECESSITY WAS NATURALLY TO OBTAIN THE BEST AND PUREST COMPOUNDS FOR ACTIVE MATERIALS
MR HUGHES CONDUCTED MOST OF THIS WORK AND LATER ON TOOK A PROMINENT PART IN EDISON'S ELECTRIC-RAILWAY EXPERIMENTS
THE UNDERGROUND SYSTEM THERE WAS LIMITED TO THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE LABORATORY AND WAS SOMEWHAT CRUDE AS WELL AS MUCH LESS COMPLICATED THAN WOULD BE THE NETWORK OF OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND LINEAL FEET WHICH HE CALCULATED TO BE REQUIRED FOR THE UNDERGROUND CIRCUITS IN THE FIRST DISTRICT OF NEW YORK CITY
AND THAT WAS USED LATER FOR INCANDESCENT-LAMP GLASS-BLOWING WHICH WAS DONE IN ANOTHER SMALL BUILDING ON ONE SIDE OF THE LABORATORY
THIS HORSESHOE OF CARBONIZED PAPER SEEMED INCAPABLE TO RESIST MECHANICAL SHOCKS AND TO MAINTAIN INCANDESCENCE FOR ANY CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME
WHY DOES HE SAY SUCH THINGS AS THESE
WE NEED NOT WONDER THAT PROFESSOR TYNDALL IN WORDS IMPLYING GRAVE DOUBT AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SOLUTION OF THE VARIOUS PROBLEMS SAID PUBLICLY THAT HE WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE MATTER IN EDISON'S HANDS THAN IN HIS OWN
FIELD JOHN BURRY--AND REMAINS IN EXTENSIVE USE AS AN APPLIANCE FOR WHICH NO SUBSTITUTE OR COMPETITOR HAS BEEN FOUND
FROM THE BEGINNING EACH PHASE OF ELECTRICAL DEVELOPMENT--INDEED EACH STEP IN MECHANICS--HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY THE WELL-KNOWN PHENOMENON OF INVENTION
THE IRREPRESSIBLE SPIRIT OF HUMOR IN THE OLD DAYS ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT STRENUOUS AT TIMES CAUSED MANY A MOMENT OF HILARITY WHICH SEEMED TO REFRESH THE BOYS AND ENABLED THEM TO WORK WITH RENEWED VIGOR AFTER ITS MANIFESTATION MR UPTON REMARKS THAT OFTEN DURING THE PERIOD OF THE INVENTION OF THE INCANDESCENT LAMP WHEN UNDER GREAT STRAIN AND FATIGUE EDISON WOULD GO TO THE ORGAN AND PLAY TUNES IN A PRIMITIVE WAY AND COME BACK TO CRACK JOKES WITH THE STAFF
IN THIS GREAT CROWD WERE MANY PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND MEN OF PROMINENCE IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE WHO WERE ENTHUSIASTIC IN THEIR PRAISES
THE FIRST MILL PLANT WAS PLACED IN THE WOOLLEN FACTORY OF JAMES HARRISON AT NEWBURGH NEW YORK ABOUT SEPTEMBER 15 1881
UNTIL OCTOBER 21 1879 THERE WAS NOTHING IN EXISTENCE RESEMBLING OUR MODERN INCANDESCENT LAMP
THE ORE-BEARING ROCK HOWEVER MUST FIRST BE GROUND TO POWDER BEFORE IT CAN BE SEPARATED
I THEREUPON STARTED TO HEAT IT
IS IT CONCEIVABLE UNDER ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HE SHOULD HAVE HAD THIS ALL-IMPORTANT LAMP IN HIS POSSESSION FROM 1872 TO 1893 AND YET NO ONE HAVE HEARD OF IT OR SEEN IT EXCEPT HIS SON
THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF THIS DROP WOULD BE A LOSS OF ILLUMINATION IN THE LAMPS AS WE GO FARTHER AWAY FROM THE SOURCE OF ENERGY
ONE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THIS EARLY STUDY OCCURRED WHEN JIM CORBETT WAS ASKED TO BOX A FEW ROUNDS IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA WITH A DARK UN TO BE SELECTED LOCALLY
HE HAD HAD HIS LIGHTS BURNING FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS
11 1880 351,855 ELECTRIC LAMP
SOME OF THE OFFICE EMPLOYEES WOULD ALSO DROP IN ONCE IN A WHILE AND AS EVERYBODY PRESENT WAS ALWAYS WELCOME TO PARTAKE OF THE MIDNIGHT MEAL WE ALL ENJOYED THESE GATHERINGS
HE DECIDED AFTER MATURE DELIBERATION THAT THE MAGNETIC SEPARATION OF LOW-GRADE ORES ON A COLOSSAL SCALE AT A LOW COST WAS THE ONLY PRACTICAL WAY OF SUPPLYING THE FURNACE-MAN WITH A HIGH QUALITY OF IRON ORE
HUGHES WAS IN CHARGE OF THE TRACK CONSTRUCTION AT MENLO PARK
IN THIS INSTANCE IT WAS OF MORE THAN USUAL IMPORT AND SERIOUSNESS AS EDISON WAS VIRTUALLY HIS OWN BACKER PUTTING INTO THE COMPANY ALMOST THE WHOLE OF ALL THE FORTUNE HIS INVENTIONS HAD BROUGHT HIM
I TOLD THE OTHER OPERATOR TO DO NOTHING
AT 8 O'CLOCK HE APPEARED WALKED AROUND WENT INTO THE BATTERY-ROOM AND THEN CAME TO ME SAYING
OUR LIGHTING PLANT WAS IN DUPLICATE AND ABOUT 12.30 OR 1 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AT THE CLOSE OF THE SUPPER-HOUR A CHANGE WOULD BE MADE FROM ONE PLANT TO THE OTHER INVOLVING THE GRADUAL EXTINCTION OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS AND THEIR SLOWLY COMING UP TO CANDLE-POWER AGAIN THE WHOLE CHANGE REQUIRING PROBABLY ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS
MOST OF THE TIME HE WAS MONKEYING WITH THE BATTERIES AND CIRCUITS AND DEVISING THINGS TO MAKE THE WORK OF TELEGRAPHY LESS IRKSOME
MANY ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE IN BY-GONE DAYS TO CONCENTRATE THE IRON IN SUCH ORES BY WATER PROCESSES BUT WITH ONLY A PARTIAL DEGREE OF SUCCESS
IT IS NOT THE ONLY TIME I HAVE KNOWN THIS SORT OF THING TO HAPPEN IN SPEAKING OF EDISON'S METHOD OF EXPERIMENTING ANOTHER OF HIS LABORATORY STAFF SAYS
THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF THE EDISON-LALANDE PRIMARY BATTERY CONDUCTED BY THE EDISON MANUFACTURING COMPANY AT THE ORANGE VALLEY PLANT IS A BUSINESS OF NO MEAN IMPORTANCE
SOME YEARS AGO A CERTAIN APPLICATION WAS MADE AND CONTAINED THE FOLLOWING TERSE AND MODEST SENTENCE
BUT IT IS WHEN WE TURN TO ELECTRICITY THAT THE RICH VIRGIN CONDITION OF AN ILLIMITABLE NEW KINGDOM OF DISCOVERY IS SEEN
THE REFERENCE FIGURES ARE USED AS BEFORE EXCEPT THAT THE HORIZONTAL LINES EXTENDING FROM SQUARE MARKED G REPRESENT THE MAIN CONDUCTORS
NO MATTER WHAT THE OBJECT REQUIRED MAY BE WHETHER ANIMATE OR INANIMATE IF IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE PLAY IT IS FOUND AND PRESSED INTO SERVICE
IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND OF THE ARTS TO WHICH THE WORLD HAS OWED ITS CONTINUED PROGRESS FROM YEAR TO YEAR THERE IS DISCLOSED ONE REMARKABLE FACT AND THAT IS THAT WHENEVER ANY IMPORTANT DISCOVERY OR INVENTION HAS BEEN MADE AND ANNOUNCED BY ONE MAN IT HAS ALMOST ALWAYS BEEN DISCLOSED LATER THAT OTHER MEN--POSSIBLY WIDELY SEPARATED AND KNOWING NOTHING OF THE OTHER'S WORK--HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING UP THE SAME GENERAL LINES OF INVESTIGATION INDEPENDENTLY WITH THE SAME OBJECT IN MIND
NO ONE SEES MORE VIVIDLY THAN HE THE FACT THAT IN THE INTERPLAY OF THE ARTS ONE INDUSTRY SHAPES AND HELPS ANOTHER AND THAT NO INVENTION LIVES TO ITSELF ALONE
HENCE THE COMING INTO BEING OF A TYPE THAT ANY ORDINARY PERSON COULD HANDLE WAS SUFFICIENT OF ITSELF TO INSURE A MARKET
TO WHAT EXTENT THE MOTION-PICTURE BUSINESS MAY GROW IN THE NOT REMOTE FUTURE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONJECTURE FOR IT HAS TAKEN A PLACE IN THE FRONT RANK OF RAPIDLY INCREASING ENTERPRISES
IN THE MEAN TIME AS I KNEW ALL THE WIRES COMING THROUGH TO THE SWITCHBOARD I RIGGED UP A TEMPORARY SET OF INSTRUMENTS SO THAT THE NEW YORK BUSINESS COULD BE CLEARED UP AND WE ALSO GOT THE REMAINDER OF THE PRESS MATTER
WITH REGARD TO THE CONDITIONS ATTENDANT UPON THE MANUFACTURE OF THE LAMPS EDISON SAYS
ONE WILL EXACTLY OFFSET THE OTHER AND NO MAGNETIC EFFECT WILL BE PRODUCED
IT WAS SAWN ASUNDER BY HAND THEN SPLIT AND SHAVED
I WOULD NOT GIVE UP
HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER
CHAPTER XXIV EDISON'S METHOD IN INVENTING WHILE THE WORLD'S PROGRESS DEPENDS LARGELY UPON THEIR INGENUITY INVENTORS ARE NOT USUALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ADOPTED INVENTION AS A DISTINCT PROFESSION BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING ARE OTHERWISE ENGAGED IN VARIOUS WALKS OF LIFE
AND AFTER GRADUALLY MAKING IMPROVEMENTS ALONG THIS LINE HE DEVELOPED FINALLY A TYPE OF HIGH-ECONOMY LAMP WHICH WOULD INTRODUCE A MOST RADICAL CHANGE IN EXISTING CONDITIONS AND LEAD ULTIMATELY TO HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS RESULTS
THE PATH TO THE QUADRUPLEX LAY THROUGH WORK ON THE DUPLEX WHICH SUGGESTED FIRST BY MOSES G
AND THEN WE SHALL HAVE DECENT STREETS INSTEAD OF STABLES MADE OUT OF STRIPS OF COBBLESTONES BORDERED BY SIDEWALKS
FOR A SHORT WHILE THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF MENLO PARK HELD EDISON'S CLAIMS IN DERISION
I FIRST MET EDISON ON MARCH 1 1881
BESIDES SUCH DETAILS WOULD FILL A BIG VOLUME
THEN WE TRIED TO GET IT BY ALL KINDS OF ROUNDABOUT WAYS BUT IN NO CASE COULD ANYBODY GET THEM AT THAT OFFICE
BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE-WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY SEEN FROM YET ANOTHER ANGLE THE WORRIES OF THIS EARLY WORK WERE NOT MERELY THOSE OF THE MEN ON THE FIRING LINE MR INSULL IN SPEAKING OF THIS PERIOD SAYS
YOUR OIL LOSSES ARE NOW GETTING LOWER I SEE THEN AFTER SUGGESTING SOME CHANGES TO REDUCE THEM STILL FURTHER HE WENT ON TO SAY
IT IS SINGULAR TO SAY THE LEAST TO NOTE HOW EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS PARALLELED AND PROVED IN ADVANCE THOSE THAT CAME LATER
SO WE GAVE HIM A JOB AS A MUCKER IN CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS
I SAW IT--ONE HUNDRED CELLS--AND GETTING THE PRICE--ONE HUNDRED GUINEAS--HURRIED TO GOURAUD
IT MUST HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
WHEN WE ARRIVED AT CALAIS TO CROSS OVER EVERYBODY MADE FOR THE RESTAURANT
PASTEUR INVITED ME TO COME DOWN TO THE INSTITUTE AND I WENT AND HAD QUITE A CHAT WITH HIM
MERCHANT BANKING SEEMS TO BE DIFFERENT AS A GENERAL THING EDISON HAS HAD NO TROUBLE IN RAISING MONEY WHEN HE NEEDED IT THE REASON BEING THAT PEOPLE HAVE FAITH IN HIM AS SOON AS THEY COME TO KNOW HIM
THE LACK OF SUCH A PLACE NEVER PREVENTED EXPERIMENTATION HOWEVER AS LONG AS HE HAD A DOLLAR IN HIS POCKET AND SOME AVAILABLE HOLE IN THE WALL WITH THE TURNING OF THE TIDE OF FORTUNE THAT SUDDENLY CARRIED HIM IN NEW YORK IN 1869 FROM POVERTY TO THE OPULENCE OF $300 A MONTH HE DREW NEARER TO A REALIZATION OF HIS CHERISHED AMBITION IN HAVING MONEY PLACE AND SOME TIME STOLEN FROM SLEEP FOR MORE SERIOUS EXPERIMENTING

A REPORT OF THIS TO EDISON BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING NOTE
ALTHOUGH THIS BRINGS THE READER UP TO THE YEAR 1879 ONE MUST TURN BACK TWO YEARS AND ACCOMPANY EDISON IN HIS FIRST ATTACK ON THE ELECTRIC-LIGHT PROBLEM
AND IF THE CORPORATION GOT BACK BY SECURING SOME PRIVILEGE WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT THE PUBLIC WAS READY TO CONDONE IF NOT APPLAUD
REPORTS MADE IN THE DISCUSSION AT THE MEETING BY ENGINEERS SHOWED THE SIMPLICITY AND SUCCESS OF THE METER
IF ALL THE LAMPS WERE LIGHTED THE CURRENT WOULD FLOW ALONG P AND THROUGH EACH PAIR OF LAMPS TO N AND SO BACK TO THE SOURCE OF ENERGY
THIS WAS THE PLAN THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PUT INTO PRACTICE IN THE GREAT WORKS AT EDISON NEW JERSEY

STILLWELL AND WAS NOW ABLE TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF COMFORTABLY WITH HIS WIFE AND FAMILY WHILE ENJOYING IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO THE NEW LABORATORY
IT WILL HAVE BEEN NOTED BY THE READER THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO INDICATE RASHNESS IN STARTING UP THE STATION AS ONLY ONE DYNAMO WAS PUT IN OPERATION
ALTHOUGH THE MOTION-PICTURE BUSINESS AS A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE IS STILL IN ITS YOUTH IT IS OF SUFFICIENT MOMENT TO CALL FOR THE ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF THOUSANDS OF MACHINES AND MANY MILLION FEET OF FILMS IN EDISON'S SHOPS HAVING A SALE VALUE OF NOT LESS THAN $750,000
EDISON'S DYNAMO WORK AT THE PRESENT WRITING WHEN AFTER THE PHENOMENALLY RAPID ELECTRICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THIRTY YEARS WE FIND ON THE MARKET A GREAT VARIETY OF MODERN FORMS OF EFFICIENT CURRENT GENERATORS ADVERTISED UNDER THE NAMES OF DIFFERENT INVENTORS NONE HOWEVER BEARING THE NAME OF EDISON A YOUNG ELECTRICAL ENGINEER OF THE PRESENT GENERATION MIGHT WELL INQUIRE WHETHER THE GREAT INVENTOR HAD EVER CONTRIBUTED ANYTHING TO THE ART BEYOND A MERE TYPE OF MACHINE FORMERLY MADE AND BEARING HIS NAME BUT NOT NOW MARKETED EXCEPT SECOND HAND
WHILE HE HAS FELT THAT IF IT MUST BE WRITTEN IT WERE BEST DONE BY THE HANDS OF FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES OF LONG STANDING WHOSE JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION HE COULD TRUST AND WHOSE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS WOULD SAVE HIM FROM MISREPRESENTATION
EDISON'S SECOND ELECTRIC RAILROAD OF 1882 WAS MORE PRETENTIOUS AS REGARDS LENGTH CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT
ALL THROUGH THE INTERVIEW I WAS TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSED WITH EDISON'S WONDERFUL RESOURCEFULNESS AND GRASP AND HIS IMMEDIATE APPRECIATION OF ANY SUGGESTION OF CONSEQUENCE BEARING ON THE SUBJECT UNDER DISCUSSION

IT WAS GREETED AT ONCE WITH SCIENTIFIC ACCLAIM AND ENTHUSIASM AS A DISTINCTLY NEW AND GREAT INVENTION ALTHOUGH AT FIRST IT WAS REGARDED MORE AS A SCIENTIFIC TOY THAN AS A COMMERCIALLY VALUABLE DEVICE

223,898 ISSUED TO EDISON ON JANUARY 27 1880 FOR AN INCANDESCENT LAMP WAS OF SUCH FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTER THAT IT OPENED UP AN ENTIRELY NEW AND TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT ART--THE ART OF INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTING
IN MY FIRST EXPERIMENTS WITH THIS SYSTEM I TRIED IT ON THE STATEN ISLAND RAILROAD AND EMPLOYED AN OPERATOR NAMED KING TO DO THE EXPERIMENTING
ABOUT THREE YEARS AFTERWARD IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT HEARD AT ALL FROM THE MAN WHO HAD RENTED THIS MACHINERY SO I THOUGHT I WOULD GO OVER TO NEWARK AND SEE HOW THINGS WERE GOING

FOUR FORMS OF ARC LIGHT WITH SPECIAL CARBONS
IN JULY 1859 HE LIT UP ONE OF THE ROOMS OF HIS HOUSE AT SALEM MASSACHUSETTS EVERY EVENING WITH SUCH LAMPS USING IN THEM SMALL PIECES OF PLATINUM AND IRIDIUM WIRE WHICH WERE MADE TO INCANDESCE BY MEANS OF CURRENT FROM PRIMARY BATTERIES
ON THIS SUBJECT OF THE VALIDITY OF THIS PATENT A VAST AMOUNT OF CONFLICTING TECHNICAL PERPLEXING AND ALMOST HYPERCRITICAL DISCUSSION AND OPINION HAS BEEN INDULGED BOTH IN THE TESTIMONY AND IN THE ABLE AND EXHAUSTIVE ARGUMENTS AND BRIEFS OF COUNSEL
IT HAS BEEN THE PRIVILEGE OF THE WRITERS TO BE PRESENT AT SOME OF THESE CONFERENCES NOT ONLY AS PARTICIPANTS BUT IN SOME CASES AS LOOKERS-ON WHILE AWAITING THEIR TURN
SUBSEQUENT EXPERIENCE HAS AMPLY PROVEN THE VALUE OF EDISON'S PRESCIENCE AT THIS TIME
THIS HAND-WHEEL WAS LOCATED IN THE CAB WHERE IT WAS EASILY ACCESSIBLE
HE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF THE MANAGER OF THE OFFICE
A GREAT MANY PERSONS WANT AUTOGRAPHS AND SOME WOULD LIKE PHOTOGRAPHS
BY WORKING NIGHT AND DAY A NEW CRANK-SHAFT WAS PUT IN AND WE ONLY HAD THREE DAYS LEFT FROM THAT TIME TO GET IT ON BOARD THE STEAMER
AFTER TESTING SOME TIME TWO LEAD-PENCILS FOUND MORE REGULAR AND VERY MUCH MORE VIVID
HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN GETTING $80 A MONTH AND HAD EKED THIS OUT BY COPYING PLAYS FOR THE THEATRE
EDISON REVERTED TO HIS INGENIOUS LIGHTING PLAN OF YEARS EARLIER AND THUS SETTLED ON A METHOD BY WHICH CURRENT SHOULD BE CONVEYED FROM THE POWER PLANT AT HIGH POTENTIAL TO MOTOR-GENERATORS PLACED BELOW THE GROUND IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE RAILS
REMAINS CHEERFUL AND TRIES SOMETHING ELSE
AT FIRST FEW VISITORS PANTED UP THE LONG FLIGHTS OF STEPS TO THE BREEZY PLATFORM
I CONCLUDED IT WAS EITHER LEAKAGE OF GAS INTO THE MANHOLE OR ELSE THE ACID USED IN PICKLING THE CASTING HAD GIVEN OFF HYDROGEN AND AIR HAD LEAKED IN MAKING AN EXPLOSIVE MIXTURE
THE SUBJOINED SKETCH SHOWS AN EXTERIOR VIEW OF SEVERAL OF THESE MOLDS AS THEY APPEAR WHEN BOLTED TOGETHER THE INTERSECTING CENTRAL PORTIONS REPRESENTING RIBS WHICH ARE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE CASTING FOR PURPOSES OF STRENGTH AND RIGIDITY
ONE STORE PUT UP A PAPER SIGN IN THE DISPLAY WINDOW WHICH SAID
UPON THE EVIDENCE HERE PRESENTED I AGREE WITH THE FIRST IMPRESSION OF MR CURTIS AND WITH THE OPINION OF MR DICKERSON THAT WHATEVER GOEBEL DID MUST BE CONSIDERED AS AN ABANDONED EXPERIMENT
THE LITTLE SYSTEM HAD PERFORATING APPARATUS OPERATED BY ELECTROMAGNETS
GENTLEMEN HE SAID I HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM A PLEASURE TRIP TO THE LAND BEYOND THE MISSISSIPPI
I AFTERWARD FOUND THAT HE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY MIXED UP WITH A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR CROOKED JOB IN CONNECTION WITH TELEPHONE PATENTS
THE GREAT NECESSITY FOR MORE DURABLE CARBONS BECAME A DESIDERATUM SO URGENT THAT THE TIRELESS INVENTOR DECIDED TO COMMISSION ANOTHER EXPLORER TO SEARCH THE TROPICAL JUNGLES OF THE ORIENT
THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME WAS RATHER NEW
REQUIRING THE SERVICES OF ONLY TWO MEN FOR THE ENTIRE WORK
ALWAYS AT HAND WILL BE FOUND ONE OR TWO OF THE LABORATORY NOTE-BOOKS WITH FREQUENT ENTRIES OR COMMENTS IN THE HANDWRITING WHICH ONCE SEEN IS NEVER FORGOTTEN

HE REQUESTED THE PROPER PERSON ON HIS ENGINEERING STAFF TO THINK THIS MATTER UP AND SUBMIT A FEW SKETCHES OF WHAT HE WOULD PROPOSE TO DO
29 1887 382,415 SYSTEM OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION
IT IS POSSIBLE ONLY TO A BROAD COMPREHENSIVE MIND WELL STORED WITH KNOWLEDGE AND BACKED WITH RESISTLESS BOUNDLESS ENERGY THAT SUCH A DIVERSIFIED SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS COULD BE CARRIED ON SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ASSIMILATED EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD RELATE TO A CLASS OF PHENOMENA ALREADY UNDERSTOOD AND WELL DEFINED
THESE CARS AND EQUIPMENTS EARNED OVER $425,000,000 IN 1907 IN GIVING THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AT A COST INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF A LITTLE OVER THREE CENTS PER PASSENGER FOR WHOM A FIFTEEN-MILE RIDE WOULD BE POSSIBLE
THE PATENT IS A PIONEER IN THE SENSE OF THE PATENT LAW
ONE OF THESE SURFACES CONSISTED OF A SMALL DRUM OR CYLINDER OF CHALK WHICH WAS KEPT IN A MOISTENED CONDITION WITH A SUITABLE CHEMICAL SOLUTION AND ADAPTED TO REVOLVE CONTINUOUSLY BY CLOCKWORK
AND THE RESULTANT PUBLIC SENSATION WAS GREAT
INDEED WITHOUT THIS TIRELESS MINUTIAE AND METHODICAL SEARCHING SPIRIT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE PRODUCED MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE INVENTIONS

ITS LOWER END FITS INTO A SLOT IN A METAL PLATE C WHICH IN TURN RESTS UPON A CARBON BUTTON
IT IS NOT TO BE DENIED HOWEVER THAT SUBSTANTIAL ADVANTAGES HAVE ACCRUED TO THEM MORE OR LESS DIRECTLY THROUGH THE NUMEROUS FAVORABLE DECISIONS OBTAINED BY THEM AS A RESULT OF THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF LITIGATION IN THE PROSECUTION OF WHICH SO GREAT A SUM OF MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT AND SO CONCENTRATED AN AMOUNT OF EFFORT AND TIME LAVISHED
HIS GREATNESS WAS ALWAYS TO BE CLEARLY SEEN WHEN DIFFICULTIES AROSE
AGAIN DESCENDING TO THE PLAINS I PASSED EASTWARD TO THE BRAHMAPUTRA RIVER WHICH I ASCENDED TO THE FOOT-HILLS IN ASSAM
HE GIVES A GRAPHIC PICTURE OF HIS FIRST METHODS AS A MANUFACTURER
THE VALUE OF HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ART OF LIGHTING COMPRISED IN THIS WORK HAS NEVER BEEN FULLY UNDERSTOOD OR APPRECIATED HAVING BEEN SO GREATLY OVERSHADOWED BY HIS INVENTION OF THE INCANDESCENT LAMP AND OF A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF DISTRIBUTION
THERE IS ONE INCONTROVERTIBLE FACT--NAMELY THAT HE WAS THE FIRST MAN TO DEVISE CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE FROM A CENTRAL STATION A PRACTICABLE LIFE-SIZE ELECTRIC RAILROAD WHICH WAS CAPABLE OF TRANSPORTING AND DID TRANSPORT PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT AT VARIABLE SPEEDS OVER VARYING GRADES AND UNDER COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE OPERATOR
ALSO THAT HE INVENTED APPROPRIATE INSTRUMENTS AND DEVICES THROUGH WHICH HE ACCOMPLISHED THIS RESULT ALTHOUGH NOT TO THAT EXTENT WHICH GAVE PROMISE OF ANY GREAT COMMERCIAL PRACTICABILITY FOR THE TELEPHONE AS IT THEN EXISTED
IT WILL BE READILY CONCEDED THAT TO MOST MEN THIS ALONE WOULD BE AN ENTERPRISE OF A LIFETIME AND SUFFICIENT IN ITSELF TO SATISFY A MODERATE AMBITION

THEY WERE DIMINISHING THE OUTPUT AND IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO MANAGE THE WORKS
WHEN ALL WAS READY HE FILLED THE CELLS WITH WHISKEY CONNECTED THE BATTERY LOCKED THE DOOR OF THE SMALL ROOM IN WHICH THEY WERE PLACED AND GAVE POSITIVE ORDERS THAT NO ONE SHOULD ENTER

HE HAD A WONDERFUL ABILITY IN POINTING OUT THE WEAK POINTS OF AN AGREEMENT OR A BALANCE-SHEET ALL THE WHILE PROTESTING HE WAS NO LAWYER OR ACCOUNTANT
IT OFTEN HAPPENED THAT WHILE WE WERE ENJOYING THE CIGARS AFTER OUR MIDNIGHT REPAST ONE OF THE BOYS WOULD START UP A TUNE ON THE ORGAN AND WE WOULD ALL SING TOGETHER OR ONE OF THE OTHERS WOULD GIVE A SOLO
THE MOST THAT COULD BE SAID OF THE CONDITION OF THE ART WHEN EDISON ENTERED THE FIELD WAS THAT IT HAD BEEN RECOGNIZED THAT IF A SERIES OF INSTANTANEOUS PHOTOGRAPHS OF A MOVING OBJECT COULD BE SECURED AT AN ENORMOUSLY HIGH RATE MANY TIMES PER SECOND--THEY MIGHT BE PASSED BEFORE THE EYE EITHER DIRECTLY OR BY PROJECTION UPON A SCREEN AND THEREBY RESULT IN A REPRODUCTION OF THE MOVEMENTS
THIS CREATED A SERIOUS SCARCITY AND A NOMADIC OPERATOR GOING TO ANY TELEGRAPHIC CENTRE WOULD BE SURE TO FIND A PLACE OPEN WAITING FOR HIM

655 MR VILLARD AS PRESIDENT OF THE EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY REQUESTED MR EDISON AS ELECTRICIAN OF THE COMPANY TO DEVISE A STREET-RAILWAY SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD BE APPLICABLE TO THE LARGEST CITIES WHERE THE USE OF THE TROLLEY WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED WHERE THE SLOT CONDUIT SYSTEM WOULD NOT BE USED AND WHERE IN GENERAL THE DETAILS OF CONSTRUCTION SHOULD BE REDUCED TO THE SIMPLEST FORM

YOU HAD BETTER GET OUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF CROOKED PEOPLE WAS SMALLER WHEN I WAS YOUNG
ON THURSDAY MAY 13 1880 AT 4 O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THIS HISTORIC LOCOMOTIVE MADE ITS FIRST TRIP PACKED WITH AS MANY OF THE BOYS AS COULD POSSIBLY FIND A PLACE TO HANG ON
BESIDES THESE THERE ARE THE COMPENSATING RESISTANCES AND CONDENSERS
DURING THE EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD AND UP TO THE EARLY PART OF 1889 THE KODAK FILM WAS BEING SLOWLY DEVELOPED BY THE EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY
NOT A SINGLE ENGINE WAS EVEN WITHIN GUNSHOT OF THE STANDARD THUS SET UP BUT THE EMERGENCY CALLED FORTH ITS MAN IN GARDINER C
HE IS WONDERFULLY HANDY WITH THE PENCIL AND WILL SOMETIMES AMUSE HIMSELF WHILE CHATTING WITH MAKING ALL KINDS OF FANCY BITS OF PENMANSHIP TWISTING HIS SIGNATURE INTO CIRCLES AND SQUARES BUT ALWAYS WRITING STRAIGHT LINES--SO STRAIGHT THEY COULD NOT BE RULED TRUER
THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY INTRODUCING THE PLATINUM WIRE INTO AN ALL-GLASS GLOBE COMPLETELY SEALED AND HIGHLY EXHAUSTED OF AIR AND PASSING A CURRENT THROUGH THE PLATINUM WIRE WHILE THE VACUUM WAS BEING MADE
HENCE IN THE CASE OF INCANDESCENT CONDUCTORS IF THE RADIATING SURFACE BE TWELVE INCHES AND THE TEMPERATURE ON EACH INCH BE 100 OR 1200 FOR ALL IF IT IS SO COILED OR ARRANGED THAT THERE IS BUT ONE-QUARTER OR THREE INCHES OF RADIATING SURFACE THEN THE TEMPERATURE ON EACH INCH WILL BE 400
THESE AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENTS WERE MAINTAINED EVEN THOUGH THE BLANK OR RECORD MIGHT BE SO MUCH OUT OF TRUE AS AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH EQUAL TO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED TIMES THE MAXIMUM DEPTH OF THE RECORD GROOVE
OF THE QUANTITY OF CLINKER PRODUCED EVEN ASSUMING THAT ALL THE CLINKER WAS OF GOOD QUALITY
THE OWNERS OF THE CANAL SOON HAD OCCASION TO REGRET THAT THEY HAD DISDAINED THE OVERTURES OF ENTERPRISING RAILROAD PROMOTERS DESIROUS OF REACHING THE VILLAGE AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF COMMERCIAL ISOLATION RAPIDLY MADE THEMSELVES FELT
SUCH AS PRESERVING THE EXPLANATIONS MADE BY A TEACHER SO THAT THE PUPIL CAN REFER TO THEM AT ANY MOMENT AND SPELLING OR OTHER LESSONS PLACED UPON THE PHONOGRAPH FOR CONVENIENCE IN COMMITTING TO MEMORY
ALL THIS INFORMATION WAS EMBODIED GRAPHICALLY IN LARGE MAPS OF THE DISTRICT BY ANNOTATIONS IN COLORED INKS
BEYOND THE STOCK-ROOM AND OCCUPYING ABOUT HALF THE BUILDING ON THE SAME FLOOR LIE A MACHINE SHOP ENGINE-ROOM AND BOILER-ROOM
THIS NEW BATTERY WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO PASS A POWERFUL CURRENT THROUGH THE MAGNET WITHOUT MATERIALLY DIMINISHING THE STRENGTH OF THE LINE CURRENT FOOTNOTE 4
IN PRACTICE AND FOR MEASUREMENTS OF A VERY DELICATE NATURE THE TASIMETER IS INSERTED IN ONE ARM OF A WHEATSTONE BRIDGE AS SHOWN AT A IN THE DIAGRAM FIG
IT DESERVES TO BE POINTED OUT THAT THE PHONOGRAPH HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN THE INTERVENING YEARS FROM THE FIRST CRUDE INSTRUMENTS OF 1877-78
THUS EQUIPPED THE LOCOMOTIVE WAS FOUND QUITE SATISFACTORY AND LONG DID YEOMAN SERVICE
MY ROOM-MATE WAS FOX THE CORRESPONDENT OF THE NEW YORK HERALD
I HAD A SET OF QUADRUPLEX OVER IN MY SHOP 10 AND 12 WARD STREET NEWARK AND HE ARRANGED TO BRING HIM OVER NEXT EVENING TO SEE THE APPARATUS
I TOLD HIM TO JAB A PENFUL OF INK ON THE PLATINUM POINTS AS THERE WAS SUGAR ENOUGH TO MAKE IT SUFFICIENTLY THICK TO HOLD UP WHEN THE OPERATOR TRIED TO BREAK--THE CURRENT STILL GOING THROUGH THE INK SO THAT HE COULD NOT BREAK
WALLACE WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST PIONEERS IN ELECTRICAL MATTERS IN THIS COUNTRY
I SOON FOUND IT WAS A PRIVATE WIRE BETWEEN NEW YORK AND PHILADELPHIA AND I HEARD AMONG A LOT OF STUFF A MESSAGE THAT SURPRISED ME
AND THE SEMI-RETIREMENT OF EDISON AT A DISTANCE OF AN HOUR BY TRAIN FROM NEW YORK STANDS AS A MEANS OF PROTECTION TO HIM AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD CERTAINLY PRESENT THEIR RESPECTS IN PERSON IF HE COULD BE GOT AT WITHOUT TROUBLE
AND HE FILLED IT WITH SOAP BUBBLES UP TO THE BRIM
WE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS

FOR YEARS PAST I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PERFECT A STORAGE BATTERY AND HAVE NOW RENDERED IT ENTIRELY SUITABLE TO AUTOMOBILE AND OTHER WORK
LOWREY WE ARE INDEBTED FOR A SIMILAR REMINISCENCE UNDER DATE OF JUNE 5 1880
ALL THE FACES WERE BLANK AND EVERY MAN SAID HE HAD NOT TAKEN A WORD ABOUT THE SHOOTING
THIS NEUTRALIZED THE TAILING EFFECT BY CLEARING THE LINE BETWEEN PULSATIONS THUS ALLOWING THE TELEGRAPHIC CHARACTERS TO BE CLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY OUTLINED UPON THE TAPE
AND HENDERSON BECAME SO DISCONCERTED HE HAD TO GIVE IT UP
BUT THE PURSUIT WAS NOT ABANDONED
FROM THE FIRST EDISON HAS DECLARED THAT IT WAS NOT HIS INTENTION TO BENEFIT PECUNIARILY THROUGH THE EXPLOITATION OF THIS PROJECT
DON'T YOU FEEL A SENSE OF REGRET IN BEING OBLIGED TO LEAVE SO MANY THINGS UNCOMPLETED TO WHICH HE REPLIED
I TOLD HIM THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SUGGESTED THAT HE HAD BETTER CIPHER SUCH COMMUNICATIONS OR PUT ON A SECRET SOUNDER
THESE LAMPS AND MANY OTHERS OF SIMILAR CHARACTER INGENIOUS AS THEY WERE FAILED TO BECOME OF ANY COMMERCIAL VALUE DUE AMONG OTHER THINGS TO THE BRIEF LIFE OF THE CARBON BURNER

ANOTHER YOUNG AMERICAN ENLISTED INTO EUROPEAN SERVICE WAS MR E
THE INCIDENT IS CURIOUSLY REVELATORY OF THE CHARACTER OF THE MAN FOR IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT WHILE LITERARY TELEGRAPHERS ARE BY NO MEANS SCARCE THERE ARE VERY FEW WHO WOULD SPEND SCANT SAVINGS ON BACK NUMBERS OF A PONDEROUS REVIEW AT AN AGE WHEN TRAGEDY BEER AND PRETZELS ARE FAR MORE ENTICING
ONE WAS USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPELLING LEVER WHICH WAS PROVIDED WITH A PAWL TO FIT INTO THE TEETH OF THE REVERSED RATCHET WHEEL ON ITS FORWARD MOVEMENT
THEY FOUND PLENTY TO DO IN THE VARIOUS DEVELOPMENTS OF THE ART AND AS I NOW LOOK BACK I SOMETIMES WONDER HOW WE DID SO MUCH IN SO SHORT A TIME MR JEHL IN HIS REMINISCENCES ADDS ANOTHER NAME TO THE ABOVE--NAMELY THAT OF JOHN W
IN FACT AS A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE I USED MORE OFTEN TO GET AT HIM AT NIGHT AS IT LEFT MY DAYS FREE TO TRANSACT HIS AFFAIRS AND ENABLED ME PROBABLY AT A MIDNIGHT LUNCHEON TO GET A FEW MINUTES OF HIS TIME TO LOOK OVER HIS CORRESPONDENCE AND GET HIS DIRECTIONS AS TO WHAT I SHOULD DO IN SOME PARTICULAR NEGOTIATION OR MATTER OF FINANCE
THE STORY OF THE INVENTION OF THE PHONOGRAPH HAS BEEN TOLD
THE SCREENING PROCESS ALLOWED THE FINEST PART OF THE CRUSHED ROCK TO PASS ON BY CONVEYOR BELTS TO THE MAGNETIC SEPARATORS WHILE THE COARSER PARTICLES WERE IN LIKE MANNER AUTOMATICALLY RETURNED TO THE ROLLS FOR FURTHER REDUCTION
BY THE RATIONAL COMPROMISE WITH ENGLAND IN THE DISPUTE OVER THE OREGON REGION PRESIDENT POLK HAD SECURED DURING 1846 FOR UNDISTURBED SETTLEMENT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF FOREST FERTILE LAND AND FISHERIES INCLUDING THE WHOLE FAIR COLUMBIA VALLEY
HE SUCCEEDED IN WHAT HE HAD SET OUT TO DO AND IT IS NOW TO BE NOTED THAT THE PRODUCT HE HAD STRIVEN SO SEDULOUSLY TO OBTAIN WAS A HIGHLY COMMERCIAL ONE FOR NOT ONLY DID THE BRIQUETTES OF CONCENTRATED ORE FULFIL THE PURPOSE OF THEIR CREATION BUT IN USE ACTUALLY TENDED TO INCREASE THE WORKING CAPACITY OF THE FURNACE AS THE FOLLOWING TEST QUOTED FROM THE IRON AGE OCTOBER 28 1897 WILL ATTEST
I STARTED IMMEDIATELY MAKING SEVERAL LARGER AND BETTER MACHINES WHICH I EXHIBITED AT MENLO PARK TO CROWDS
FOR WHEN THE BELL PATENT EXPIRED IN 1893 THE TOTAL OF TELEPHONE SETS IN OPERATION IN THE UNITED STATES WAS ONLY 291,253
ON THE COST OF THE MOLDS AND 4 PER CENT
SO WHEN I AM AFTER A CHEMICAL RESULT THAT I HAVE IN MIND I MAY MAKE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF EXPERIMENTS OUT OF WHICH THERE MAY BE ONE THAT PROMISES RESULTS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
AND WHEREVER THEY ARE THOSE BOOKS ARE READ
IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT MR EDISON WAS NOT VERY PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED WITH THE DESIRE ENTERTAINED IN THAT QUARTER TO UTILIZE ANY IMPROVEMENT FOR HE REMARKS
IN THIS AS WELL AS IN THE PHONOGRAPH BUSINESS THERE ARE MANY OTHER MANUFACTURERS IN THE FIELD
THEY ARE CONSTRUCTED ENTIRELY OF REINFORCED CONCRETE WITH EDISON CEMENT INCLUDING WALLS FLOORS AND STAIRWAYS THUS ELIMINATING FIRE HAZARD TO THE UTMOST EXTENT AND INSURING A HIGH DEGREE OF PROTECTION CLEANLINESS AND SANITATION
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE UNNECESSARY LABOR AND A FRUITLESS TASK FOR ME TO ENTER INTO ANY FURTHER TECHNICAL DISCUSSION OF THE MECHANICAL PROBLEMS INVOLVED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEEKING TO CONVINCE EITHER SIDE OF ITS ERROR
THE 8000 OR SO MOTION-PICTURE THEATRES OF THE COUNTRY EMPLOY NO FEWER THAN 40,000 PEOPLE WHOSE AGGREGATE ANNUAL INCOME AMOUNTS TO NOT LESS THAN $37,000,000
AND FINALLY IN THIS RECITAL OF PERPLEXING CONDITIONS CONFRONTING THE INVENTOR THERE MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THE COMMERCIAL SHARK WHOSE PREDATORY INSTINCTS ARE EVER KEENLY ALERT FOR TENDER VICTIMS

WHAT DID HE PROMISE YOU I REPLIED
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT EVER CAME ABOUT AS IT IS NOT IN MY LINE BUT I SEEMED TO BE DELEGATED TO SHOW THEM AROUND
A FEW YEARS OF RATHER UNSATISFACTORY COMMERCIAL EXPERIENCE BROUGHT ABOUT A REORGANIZATION THROUGH WHICH EDISON RESUMED POSSESSION OF THE BUSINESS
ON THE CONTRARY ALL OF THE FEW TYPES THEN OBTAINABLE WERE UNECONOMICAL INDEED WASTEFUL IN REGARD TO EFFICIENCY

I SAID TO THE MAN
WITH THE FORMER THE SOUND VIBRATIONS IMPINGE UPON A STEEL DIAPHRAGM ARRANGED ADJACENT TO THE POLE OF A BAR ELECTROMAGNET WHEREBY THE DIAPHRAGM ACTS AS AN ARMATURE AND BY ITS VIBRATIONS INDUCES VERY WEAK ELECTRIC IMPULSES IN THE MAGNETIC COIL

THIS IS PATENT NO
TWO VERY SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES LAY IN THE WAY OF ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENT HOWEVER--FIRST THE PRODUCTION OF A SENSITIVE SURFACE IN SUCH FORM AND WEIGHT AS TO BE CAPABLE OF BEING SUCCESSIVELY BROUGHT INTO POSITION AND EXPOSED AT THE NECESSARILY HIGH RATE
IN MANY PLANTS THIS MIXTURE IS MADE BY BARROW OR LOAD UNITS AND MAY BE MORE OR LESS ACCURATE

WHAT OTHER FACTORS ARE THERE TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION TO EXPLAIN THIS PHENOMENON
MR GOULD PERSONALLY BOUGHT UP AND GAVE MONEY AND BONDS FOR ONE OR TWO INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS ON THE ABOVE BASIS INCLUDING THAT OF HARRINGTON WHO IN HIS REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY EXECUTED ASSIGNMENTS TO MR GOULD
JUNE 17 1901 692,507 REVERSIBLE GALVANIC BATTERY
A TRACE OF THE CANADIAN ENVIRONMENT IS SEEN IN THE FACT THAT EDISON'S ELDER BROTHER WAS NAMED WILLIAM PITT AFTER THE GREAT ENGLISH STATESMAN
ARDUOUS YEARS IN THE CENTRAL WEST VI
AFTER THAT THEY WERE SHOWN THE METERS BY WHICH THE CONSUMPTION OF CURRENT WAS MEASURED
ON ASSURANCE OF MY FATHER WHO SAID THAT THERE WAS NOT HE SAID IT WAS MOST EXTRAORDINARY
THE EARLY ARC LAMPS WERE RATED TO REQUIRE 9 TO 10 AMPERES OF CURRENT AT 45 VOLTS PRESSURE EACH RECEIVING WHICH THEY WERE ESTIMATED TO GIVE 2000 C.P WHICH WAS ARRIVED AT BY ADDING TOGETHER THE LIGHT FOUND AT FOUR DIFFERENT POSITIONS SO THAT IN REALITY THE ACTUAL LIGHT WAS ABOUT 500 C.P
THE RANKS ARE WELL FILLED EVERYWHERE AND OF LATE YEARS THE TELEGRAPH AS AN ART OR INDUSTRY HAS SHOWN RELATIVELY SLIGHT EXPANSION OWING CHIEFLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TELEPHONY
AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR A MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE TWO OPPOSED ARMIES REMAINED AT THE KEY UNDER MORE PEACEFUL SURROUNDINGS BUT THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL AND RAILROAD SYSTEMS FOSTERED A NEW DEMAND AND THEN FOR A TIME IT SEEMED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TRAIN NEW OPERATORS FAST ENOUGH
WHEN THE TRANSMITTING INSTRUMENT WAS IN OPERATION THE PERFORATED TAPE WAS PASSED OVER THE DRUM IN CONTINUOUS PROGRESSIVE MOTION
HE HAD A GOOD GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF MACHINERY AND VERY SOON ACQUIRED SUCH FAMILIARITY WITH THE DYNAMOS THAT HE COULD SKIP ABOUT AMONG THEM WITH ASTONISHING AGILITY TO REGULATE THEIR BRUSHES OR TO THROW ROSIN ON THE BELTS WHEN THEY BEGAN TO SQUEAL
HER SCHOOL-ROOM WAS ABOUT TWENTY BY TWENTY FEET NOT INCLUDING A SMALL PLATFORM
AND THERE WAS SOME DEFTNESS REQUIRED ALSO IN FASTENING DOWN THE TINFOIL ON THE CYLINDER WHERE IT WAS HELD BY A PIN RUNNING IN A LONGITUDINAL SLOT
ON COMPARISON WITH THE COMPANY'S BILL RENDERED ON THE METER-READING THE METER CAME WITHIN A FEW CENTS OF THE AMOUNT COMPUTED FROM THE CARD RECORDS AND MR MORGAN WAS COMPLETELY SATISFIED OF THE ACCURACY OF THE METER IT IS A STRANGE BUT NOT EXTRAORDINARY COMMENTARY ON THE PERVERSITY OF HUMAN NATURE AND THE LACK OF CORRECT OBSERVATION TO NOTE THAT EVEN AFTER THE PEARL STREET STATION HAD BEEN IN ACTUAL OPERATION TWENTY-FOUR HOURS A DAY FOR NEARLY THREE MONTHS THERE SHOULD STILL REMAIN AN ATTITUDE OF CAN'T BE DONE THAT SUCH A SCEPTICISM STILL OBTAINED IS EVIDENCED BY THE PUBLIC PRINTS OF THE PERIOD

ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
THE WORLD NEVER SAW A MAN MORE DEEPLY AND DESPERATELY CONVINCED THAT NOTHING IN IT APPROACHES PERFECTION
KINETOGRAPH AND PROJECTING KINETOSCOPE ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE ARTS IN WHICH EDISON HAS BEEN A PIONEER HAVE BEEN ENRICHED BY HIS NUMEROUS INVENTIONS AND PATENTS WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENT TO THOSE OF A FUNDAMENTAL NATURE THE SO-CALLED MOTION-PICTURE ART IS AN EXCEPTION AS THE FOLLOWING TOGETHER WITH THREE OTHER ADDITIONAL PATENTS 30 COMPRISE ALL THAT HE HAS TAKEN OUT ON THIS SUBJECT
THERE WERE REGULAR DAILY STOCK-MARKET REPORTS IN LONDON NEWSPAPERS IN 1825 AND NEW YORK SOON FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE
IN THIS RESPECT OF COLLABORATION EDISON HAS ALWAYS ADOPTED A POLICY THAT MUST IN PART BE TAKEN TO EXPLAIN HIS MANY SUCCESSES
HE SAID TO THE DOCTOR
THEN HOW ABOUT THE SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT ELECTRIC CURRENT CORRECTED EDISON
THESE TWO STUDIOS WHILE SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN PLANT ARE UNDER THE SAME GENERAL MANAGEMENT AND THEIR ORIGINAL NEGATIVE FILMS ARE FORWARDED AS MADE TO THE ORANGE WORKS WHERE THE LARGE COPYING DEPARTMENT IS LOCATED IN ONE OF THE CONCRETE BUILDINGS
ON THE CONTRARY EDISON'S MIND WELCOMED ALMOST ANY NEW SUGGESTION AS A RELIEF FROM THE REGULAR WORK IN HAND
BUT THE EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR WALLS ARE SMOOTH AND MAY BE PAINTED OR TINTED IF DESIRED
SOME OF THESE HAVE PASSED INTO THE SLANG OF THE DAY 73 BEING WELL KNOWN AS A TELEGRAPHER'S EXPRESSION OF COMPLIMENTS OR GOOD WISHES WHILE 23 IS AN ACCIDENT OR DEATH MESSAGE AND HAS BEEN GIVEN BROADER POPULAR SIGNIFICANCE AS A GENERAL SYNONYM FOR HOODOO ALL OF THIS CAME EASILY TO EDISON WHO HAD MOREOVER AS HIS HERALD SHOWED AN UNUSUAL FAMILIARITY WITH TRAIN MOVEMENT ALONG THAT PORTION OF THE GRAND TRUNK ROAD
TO THE FACES OF THESE ROLLS WERE BOLTED A SERIES OF HEAVY CHILLED-IRON PLATES CONTAINING A NUMBER OF PROJECTING KNOBS TWO INCHES HIGH
THUS THERE HAS BEEN INITIATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW AND IMPORTANT INDUSTRY WHOSE POSSIBLE ULTIMATE PROPORTIONS ARE BEYOND THE RANGE OF PRESENT CALCULATION
TWO METHODS OF SPACE TELEGRAPHY AT SEA
HE WAS CONVINCED HOWEVER THAT THE GREATEST FIELD OF LIGHTING LAY IN THE ILLUMINATION OF HOUSES AND OTHER COMPARATIVELY ENCLOSED AREAS TO REPLACE THE ORDINARY GAS LIGHT RATHER THAN IN THE ILLUMINATION OF STREETS AND OTHER OUTDOOR PLACES BY LIGHTS OF GREAT VOLUME AND BRILLIANCY
EDISON HAD OBSERVED THE TENDENCY OF THIS FORCE TO DIFFUSE ITSELF IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS THROUGH THE AIR AND THROUGH MATTER HENCE THE NAME ETHERIC THAT HE HAD PROVISIONALLY APPLIED TO IT
WHILE EDISON WAS IN CINCINNATI A DELEGATION OF FIVE UNION OPERATORS WENT OVER FROM CLEVELAND TO FORM A LOCAL BRANCH AND THE OCCASION WAS ONE OF GREAT CONVIVIALITY

TURNING OUR ATTENTION NOW TO THE TELEPHONE WE AGAIN MEET A CONDITION THAT CALLS FOR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION BEFORE WE CAN PROPERLY APPRECIATE HOW MUCH THE GROWTH OF THIS INDUSTRY OWES TO EDISON'S INVENTIVE GENIUS
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE EDISON IN A STIFFLY FORMAL HOUSE AND THIS BIG COZY THREE-STORY RAMBLING MANSION HAS AN EASY FREEDOM ABOUT IT WITHOUT AND WITHIN QUITE IN KEEPING WITH THE GENIUS OF THE INVENTOR BUT REVEALING AT EVERY TURN TRACES OF FEMININE TASTE AND CULTURE
THAT WAS LEFT TO OTHERS AND TO THE APPLICATION OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT WHICH HAS ENABLED ENGINEERS TO HARNESS REMOTE POWERS AND WITHIN THOROUGHLY ECONOMICAL LIMITS TRANSMIT THOUSANDS OF HORSE-POWER AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED MILES AT PRESSURES OF 80,000 AND 100,000 VOLTS
IN ADDITION THERE MUST BE INCLUDED MR SAMUEL INSULL WHOSE ACTIVITIES FOR MANY YEARS AS PRIVATE SECRETARY AND FINANCIAL MANAGER WERE DEVOTED SOLELY TO MR EDISON'S INTERESTS WITH MENLO PARK AS A CENTRE AND MAIN SOURCE OF ANXIETY AS TO PAY-ROLLS AND OTHER CONSTANTLY RECURRING OBLIGATIONS

THE PHILOSOPHY OF REPRODUCTION IS VERY SIMPLE AND IS ILLUSTRATED DIAGRAMMATICALLY IN FIG
EDISON IS THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION INCARNATE APPLIED TO MECHANICS
AND THEY CAME DOWN AND PUT A STREAM THROUGH THE WINDOW
THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD AT THAT TIME WAS ENGAGED IN A CONTROVERSY REGARDING THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL RESISTANCE OF A CIRCUIT IN WHICH A GENERATOR WAS SITUATED
THIS WAS A DAY JOB AND HE DID NOT LIKE IT

IN PRIVATE LIFE THEY SHOW HIM TO BE A GOOD CITIZEN A GOOD FAMILY MAN ABSOLUTELY MORAL TEMPERATE IN ALL THINGS AND OF GREAT CHARITABLENESS TO ALL MANKIND
INDEED HIS COMPARATIVELY UNKNOWN ENTERPRISE OF SEPARATING MAGNETICALLY AND PUTTING INTO COMMERCIAL FORM LOW-GRADE IRON ORE AS CARRIED ON AT EDISON NEW JERSEY PROVED TO BE THE MOST COLOSSAL EXPERIMENT THAT HE HAS EVER MADE
A FURTHER LARGE PART IS BASED UPON THE PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF MANY LOYAL ASSOCIATES
HIS NAME WAS ADAMS
I WENT ONE NIGHT HE SAYS INTO THE BATTERY-ROOM TO OBTAIN SOME SULPHURIC ACID FOR EXPERIMENTING
ONE OF THESE WAS THE TELEPHONOGRAPH A COMBINATION OF A TELEPHONE AT A DISTANT STATION WITH A PHONOGRAPH
UNDER THE INVENTIVE LEADERSHIP OF SUCH BRILLIANT MEN AS BRUSH THOMSON WESTON AND VAN DEPOELE--THERE WERE SCORES OF OTHERS--THE INDUSTRY HAD MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS AND THE ART HAD BEEN FIRMLY ESTABLISHED
GENTLEMEN SAID HE YOU SEE BEFORE YOU AN OPERATOR WHO HAS REACHED THE LIMIT OF IMPECUNIOSITY NOT FAR FROM THE LIMIT OF IMPECUNIOSITY WAS EDISON HIMSELF AS HE LANDED IN BOSTON IN 1868 AFTER THIS WINTRY ORDEAL
HERE A PATENT HAVING ONCE BEEN SUSTAINED SAY IN BOSTON MAY HAVE TO BE LITIGATED ALL OVER AGAIN IN NEW YORK AND AGAIN IN PHILADELPHIA AND SO ON FOR ALL THE FEDERAL CIRCUITS
WE WERE DRIVEN BY CARRIAGE FROM MILAN OHIO TO A RAILROAD THEN TO A PORT ON LAKE ERIE THENCE BY A CANAL-BOAT IN A TOW OF SEVERAL TO PORT BURWELL IN CANADA ACROSS THE LAKE AND FROM THERE WE DROVE TO VIENNA A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY
IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE MAIN BUILDING AND THE FOUR SMALLER STRUCTURES CONSTITUTING THE LABORATORY PLANT WERE GRASS MEADOWS THAT STRETCHED AWAY FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND AT ITS BACK DOOR SO TO SPEAK DUCKS PADDLED AROUND AND QUACKED IN A POND UNDISTURBED

THE ROCK IS BROKEN DOWN AND THEN GROUND TO A FINENESS OF 80 TO 90 PER CENT
THIS WAS DONE
THEY COULD NOT BE USED FOR DOMESTIC PURPOSES
IN HIS EARLIEST CONSIDERATION OF THE PROBLEM OF SUBDIVIDING THE ELECTRIC CURRENT HE HAD DECIDED THAT THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION LAY IN THE EMPLOYMENT OF A LAMP WHOSE INCANDESCING BODY SHOULD HAVE A HIGH RESISTANCE COMBINED WITH A SMALL RADIATING SURFACE AND BE CAPABLE OF BEING USED IN WHAT IS CALLED MULTIPLE ARC SO THAT EACH UNIT OR LAMP COULD BE TURNED ON OR OFF WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH ANY OTHER UNIT OR LAMP

EDISON ONLY ASKED FOR THE EARTH THE LATE JACOB HESS A FAMOUS NEW YORK REPUBLICAN POLITICIAN WAS A MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION APPOINTED TO PUT THE WIRES UNDERGROUND IN NEW YORK CITY IN THE EIGHTIES HE STATED THAT WHEN THE COMMISSION WAS STRUGGLING WITH THE PROBLEM AND EXAMINING ALL KINDS OF DEVICES AND PLANS PATENTED AND UNPATENTED FOR WHICH FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN ASKED THE BODY TURNED TO EDISON IN ITS PERPLEXITY AND ASKED FOR ADVICE
IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY AND SO GREAT WAS THE POWER DEVELOPED APPARENTLY FROM THE SMALL BATTERY THAT MORSE EXCLAIMED
TO THE LAY MIND A STORAGE BATTERY PRESENTS ITSELF IN THE ASPECT OF A DEVICE IN WHICH ELECTRIC ENERGY IS STORED JUST AS COMPRESSED AIR IS STORED OR ACCUMULATED IN A TANK

IN THE EARLY DAYS OF WORK ON THE INCANDESCENT LAMP ALSO THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE WITH MERCURY
FIELD TOOK CURRENT FROM A CENTRAL RAIL BETWEEN THE TWO OUTER RAILS THAT WERE THE RETURN CIRCUIT THE CONTACT BEING A RUBBING WIRE BRUSH ON EACH SIDE OF THE THIRD RAIL ANSWERING THE SAME PURPOSE AS THE CONTACT SHOE OF LATER DATE
A RETROSPECTIVE SURVEY SHOWS THAT HAD THE MEN IN CONTROL OF THE AMERICAN GAS-LIGHTING ART IN 1880 BEEN SUFFICIENTLY FAR-SIGHTED AND HAD THEY TAKEN A BROADER VIEW OF THE SITUATION THEY MIGHT EASILY HAVE REMAINED DOMINANT IN THE WHOLE FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING BY SECURING THE OWNERSHIP OF THE PATENTS AND DEVICES OF THE NEW INDUSTRY
ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR POOR BUSINESS CAPACITY AND LACK OF PRACTICALITY THEY CONVEYED UNDER THE PATENTS ALL RIGHTS TO DIFFERENT CORPORATIONS BUT IN SUCH A WAY AND WITH SUCH CONFUSED WORDING OF THE CONTRACTS THAT I NEVER GOT A CENT
SHOULD THE MIXTURE BE POURED INTO A HORIZONTAL MOLD LIKE THE FLOOR OF A HOUSE THE STONE AND SAND SETTLE FORMING AN UNUNIFORM MASS

AMONG ALL THE MEN I HAVE HAD ASSOCIATED WITH ME HE HAD THE COMMERCIAL INSTINCT MOST HIGHLY DEVELOPED ONE NEED NOT WONDER AT EDISON'S REMINISCENT REMARK THAT IN ANY TRADE ANY OF MY BOYS MADE WITH BERGMANN HE ALWAYS GOT THE BEST OF THEM NO MATTER WHAT IT WAS
I TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT WAS SO VERY SIMPLE BUT THE RESULTS WERE SO SURPRISING THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS PROBABLY THAT THEY NEVER WOULD UNDERSTAND IT--AND THEY DIDN'T
AS HE EXPRESSED IT
THIS WAS THE GREAT MACHINE KNOWN AS JUMBO NO
THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING ENGINEERS IN THOSE DAYS TO RUN THE HIGH-SPEED ENGINES THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE IS WELL ILLUSTRATED BY AN AMUSING INCIDENT IN THE VERY EARLY HISTORY OF THE STATION

THE QUAINT OLD MORAVIAN MISSION AND QUONDAM INDIAN SETTLEMENT OF ONE HUNDRED INHABITANTS FOUND ITSELF OF A SUDDEN ONE OF THE GREAT GRAIN PORTS OF THE WORLD AND BIDDING FAIR TO RIVAL RUSSIAN ODESSA
THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING A RECORD OF ANIMATE MOVEMENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY REPRODUCING IT WAS PREDICTED LONG BEFORE THE ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENT
AS EARLY AS 1845 THE RESULTS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF WHEN STARR A TALENTED AMERICAN WHO DIED AT THE EARLY AGE OF TWENTY-FIVE SUGGESTED IN HIS ENGLISH PATENT OF THAT YEAR TWO FORMS OF SMALL INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS ONE HAVING A BURNER MADE FROM PLATINUM FOIL PLACED UNDER A GLASS COVER WITHOUT EXCLUDING THE AIR
IF YOU WILL GO UP TO THE HOUSE HIS PALATIAL HOME NOT FAR AWAY AND LOOK BEHIND THE SOFA IN THE LIBRARY YOU WILL FIND A JOINT OF BAMBOO A SPECIMEN OF THAT FOUND IN SOUTH AMERICA
ALL RIGHT I SAID
THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY NEXT CLAIMS OUR CONSIDERATION BUT WE ARE IMMEDIATELY CONFRONTED BY A DIFFICULTY WHICH SEEMS INSURMOUNTABLE WHEN WE ATTEMPT TO FORMULATE ANY DEFINITE ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE AND INFLUENCE OF EDISON'S PIONEER WORK AND INVENTIONS
ANOTHER VITAL TEST WAS MADE AT THIS TIME--NAMELY OF THE STRENGTH OF THE IRON STRUCTURE ITSELF ON WHICH THE PLANT WAS ERECTED
NOT THE LEAST OF THE MECHANICAL QUESTIONS WAS SETTLED BY EDISON'S DECISION TO MAKE THIS TREMENDOUSLY LONG KILN IN SECTIONS OF CAST-IRON WITH FLANGES BOLTED TOGETHER AND SUPPORTED ON ROLLERS ROTATED BY ELECTRIC MOTORS
IN VIEW OF THE FACTS THAT A FINAL INJUNCTION ON THE LAMP PATENT WAS NOT OBTAINED UNTIL THE LIFE OF THE PATENT WAS NEAR ITS END AND NEXT THAT NO DAMAGES IN MONEY WERE EVER PAID BY THE GUILTY INFRINGERS IT HAS BEEN GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT MR EDISON SACRIFICED THE INTEREST OF HIS STOCKHOLDERS SELFISHLY WHEN HE DELAYED THE PROSECUTION OF PATENT SUITS AND GAVE ALL HIS TIME AND ENERGIES TO MANUFACTURING
WHILE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF THIS INVENTION WAS TO ACCOMPLISH THE REPETITION OF SIGNALS WITHOUT THE AID OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC RELAY THE INSTRUMENT DEVISED BY EDISON WAS CAPABLE OF USE AS A RECORDER ALSO BY EMPLOYING A SMALL WHEEL INKED BY A FOUNTAIN WHEEL AND ATTACHED TO THE VIBRATING ARM THROUGH SUITABLE MECHANISM
BUT THE CROOKED ROADS WITHOUT IMPROVEMENTS ARE ROADS OF GENIUS THE PRODUCT OF EDISON'S BRAIN MAY BE DIVIDED INTO THREE CLASSES
THEY UTTERLY DESPISED THE ARTFULLY SLOW BRITISH WORKMAN WHO DID AS LITTLE FOR HIS WAGES AS HE POSSIBLY COULD
IN THE COURSE OF HIS ADDRESS TO THE COURT MR LOWREY SAID
CONNECTED WITH ITS LINES WERE APPROXIMATELY 85,000 CUSTOMERS WIRED FOR 3,813,899 INCANDESCENT LAMPS AND NEARLY 225,000 HORSE-POWER THROUGH INDUSTRIAL ELECTRIC MOTORS CONNECTED WITH THE UNDERGROUND SERVICE
ONE OF MY LABORATORY ASSISTANTS WENT OUT WITH ME AND WE VISITED MANY OF THE MINES OF NEW JERSEY BUT DID NOT FIND DEPOSITS OF ANY MAGNITUDE
IT WILL BE NECESSARY FIRST TO DISSOLVE EVERYTHING OUT BY SAY HOT TURPENTINE THEN SUCCESSIVELY TREAT THE RESIDUE WITH BISULPHIDE CARBON BENZOL ETHER CHLOROFORM NAPHTHA TOLUOL ALCOHOL AND OTHER PROBABLE SOLVENTS
HE COULD NOT START AND DEVELOP THE NEW AND HARD BUSINESS OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING AND YET SPARE ONE HOUR TO PURSUE INFRINGERS
130 GREAT BRITAIN
MR EDISON ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THE SHOT BUT MISSED IT AND SAID PUT THE BALLS BACK SO I PUT THEM BACK IN THE SAME POSITION AND HE MISSED IT THE SECOND TIME
IN PASSING IT MAY BE MENTIONED THAT IN ENGLAND FRANCE AND GERMANY ALSO THE EDISON FUNDAMENTAL LAMP PATENT WAS STUBBORNLY FOUGHT IN THE JUDICIAL ARENA AND HIS CLAIM TO BE THE FIRST INVENTOR OF PRACTICAL INCANDESCENT LIGHTING WAS UNIFORMLY SUSTAINED IN ALL THOSE COUNTRIES
THIS WAS DONE AND THUS WITH THE TELEPHONE MONEY I RECEIVED $12,000 YEARLY FOR THAT PERIOD FROM THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY A YEAR OR TWO LATER THE MOTOGRAPH CROPPED UP AGAIN IN EDISON'S WORK IN A CURIOUS MANNER
THIS WAS MR CHINNOCK WHO WAS THEN SUPERINTENDENT OF THE METROPOLITAN TELEPHONE COMPANY OF NEW YORK
ONE OF THE GREATEST WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF A MINORITY TO PREVENT BAD LEGISLATION IS FILIBUSTERING ON VOTES AND THIS INSTRUMENT WOULD PREVENT IT I SAW THE TRUTH OF THIS BECAUSE AS PRESS OPERATOR I HAD TAKEN MILES OF CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS AND TO THIS DAY AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME IS WASTED DURING EACH SESSION OF THE HOUSE IN FOOLISHLY CALLING THE MEMBERS NAMES AND RECORDING AND THEN ADDING THEIR VOTES WHEN THE WHOLE OPERATION COULD BE DONE IN ALMOST A MOMENT BY MERELY PRESSING A PARTICULAR BUTTON AT EACH DESK
WHAT WE NEED HE HAS SAID ARE MEN CAPABLE OF DOING WORK
THE MARKET WAS PRACTICALLY AS FREE AND OPEN AS IF NO PATENT EXISTED
WHILE OTHER RARE METALS WERE THE SUBJECT OF CASUAL TRIAL
THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER WAS HELD ON THE HEAD WITH A SPRING THE FLEXIBLE CONNECTING WIRE BEING ATTACHED TO THE LAP BOARD THUS LEAVING THE OPERATOR WITH BOTH HANDS FREE
CHAPTER XII MEMORIES OF MENLO PARK FROM THE SPRING OF 1876 TO 1886 EDISON LIVED AND DID HIS WORK AT MENLO PARK
AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APPARATUS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
BY REASON OF MORE OR LESS INHERENT NATIVE GENIUS THEY EITHER MAKE IMPROVEMENTS ALONG LINES OF PRESENT OCCUPATION OR ELSE EVOLVE NEW METHODS AND MEANS OF ACCOMPLISHING RESULTS IN FIELDS FOR WHICH THEY MAY HAVE PERSONAL PREDILECTIONS
IN A GRAPHIC LETTER FROM MENLO PARK TO MR GOULD DATED FEBRUARY 2 1877 EDISON MAKES A MOST VIGOROUS AND IMPASSIONED COMPLAINT OF HIS TREATMENT WHICH ACTING CUMULATIVELY WAS A LONG UNBROKEN DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME
BUT HE DEVOTED HIS ENERGIES CHIEFLY TO THE MAKING OF SHINGLES FOR WHICH THERE WAS A LARGE DEMAND LOCALLY AND ALONG THE LAKE
BEFORE BOTH TRIBUNALS THE CAUSE HAD BEEN FULLY REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL CHOSEN FROM AMONG THE MOST EMINENT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BAR AT THAT TIME THOSE REPRESENTING THE EDISON INTERESTS BEING THE LATE CLARENCE A
THIS MAY ANSWER PERHAPS IN A SMALL PLACE WHERE THE MANAGER CAN GAUGE PRETTY CLOSELY FROM ACTUAL OBSERVATION WHAT EACH CUSTOMER DOES
EDISON ALSO FURNISHED DE LONG WITH A SET OF TELEPHONES PROVIDED WITH EXTENSIBLE CIRCUITS SO THAT PARTIES ON THE ICE-FLOES COULD GO LONG DISTANCES FROM THE SHIP AND STILL KEEP IN COMMUNICATION WITH HER
THIS ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE FACT THAT EDISON'S LAMP WAS ONE HAVING A HIGH RESISTANCE AND RELATIVELY SMALL RADIATING SURFACE WHILE KONN'S LAMP WAS ONE HAVING A VERY LOW RESISTANCE AND LARGE RADIATING SURFACE CONTINUING THE DIGRESSION ONE STEP FARTHER IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THE TERM MULTIPLE ARC IT MAY BE STATED THAT THERE ARE TWO PRINCIPAL SYSTEMS OF DISTRIBUTING ELECTRIC CURRENT ONE TERMED SERIES AND THE OTHER MULTIPLE ARC THE TWO ARE ILLUSTRATED DIAGRAMMATICALLY SIDE BY SIDE THE ARROWS INDICATING FLOW OF CURRENT
I KNEW IT WAS A COMMERCIAL PROBLEM TO PRODUCE HIGH-GRADE BESSEMER ORE FROM THESE DEPOSITS AND TOOK STEPS TO ACQUIRE A LARGE AMOUNT OF THE PROPERTY
WHEN THE TYPE-WHEELS HAVE ARRIVED AT THE PROPER POINT THE ROCKING-LEVER HAS BEEN CARRIED TO A POSITION WHERE ITS LOWER ARM IS DIRECTLY OVER ONE OF THE PINS ON THE ARM EXTENDING FROM THE PLATEN OF THE PRESS-LEVER
IF FOR INSTANCE A SERIES OF IDENTICAL PORTRAITS WERE RAPIDLY PRESENTED TO THE EYE A SINGLE PICTURE WOULD APPARENTLY BE VIEWED OR IF WE PRESENTED TO THE EYE THE SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF A MOVING OBJECT EACH ONE REPRESENTING A MINUTE SUCCESSIVE PHASE OF THE MOVEMENT THE MOVEMENTS THEMSELVES WOULD APPARENTLY AGAIN TAKE PLACE
THE ORIGINAL EDISON PHONOGRAPH THUS BUILT BY KRUESI IS PRESERVED IN THE SOUTH KENSINGTON MUSEUM LONDON
BUT THE REAL TRUTH IS THAT WHILE GIFTED WITH UNUSUAL IMAGINATION EDISON'S MARCH TO THE GOAL OF A NEW INVENTION IS POSITIVELY HUMDRUM AND MONOTONOUS IN ITS STEADY PROGRESS
IT WAS THE COMMON PRACTICE TO TWINE THE ELECTRIC WIRES AROUND THE DISUSED GAS-FIXTURES FASTEN THEM WITH TAPE OR STRING AND CONNECT THEM TO LAMP-SOCKETS SCREWED INTO ATTACHMENTS UNDER THE GAS-BURNERS--ELABORATED LATER INTO WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE COMBINATION FIXTURE AS A RESULT IT WAS NO UNCOMMON THING TO SEE BRIGHT SPARKS SNAPPING BETWEEN THE CHANDELIER AND THE LIGHTING WIRES DURING A SHARP THUNDER-STORM
MAREY LIKE MUYBRIDGE PHOTOGRAPHED ONLY ONE CYCLE OF THE MOVEMENTS OF A SINGLE OBJECT WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REPRODUCED OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THE CAMERA WAS IN THE FORM OF A GUN WHICH COULD FOLLOW THE OBJECT SO THAT THE SUCCESSIVE PICTURES WOULD BE ALWAYS LOCATED IN THE CENTRE OF THE PLATES

IT MIGHT BE INJUDICIOUS TO GAUGE THE GREATNESS OF A MAN BY THE NUMBER OF HIS CALLERS OR HIS LETTERS
INASMUCH AS UNLIKE POLES OF MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER AND LIKE POLES REPELLED IT FOLLOWS THAT THIS NORTH POLE WILL BE REPELLED BY THE NORTH POLE OF THE ELECTROMAGNET BUT WILL SWING OVER AND BE ATTRACTED BY ITS SOUTH POLE
AND AT THIS STAGE OF THE NARRATIVE MIDWAY IN THAT INTERESTING AND EVENTFUL PERIOD IT IS APPROPRIATE TO OFFER A FEW NOTES AND JOTTINGS ON THE PLACE ITSELF AROUND WHICH TRADITION IS ALREADY WEAVING ITS FANCIES JUST AS AT THE TIME THE OUTPOURING OF NEW INVENTIONS FROM IT INVESTED THE NAME WITH SUDDEN PROMINENCE AND WITH THE GLAMOUR OF ROMANCE
BUT I BELIEVE CENTRAL STATIONS WILL FIND IN THIS WORK VERY SOON THE LARGEST PART OF THEIR LOAD
THE IMPROVED EDISON MEGAPHONE FOR LONG-DISTANCE WORK COMPRISED TWO HORNS OF WOOD OR METAL ABOUT SIX FEET LONG TAPERING FROM A DIAMETER OF TWO FEET SIX INCHES AT THE MOUTH TO A SMALL APERTURE PROVIDED WITH EAR-TUBES
AND AN ELECTROLYTE FURTHERMORE WHICH ALTHOUGH DECOMPOSED BY THE ACTION OF THE BATTERY IS IMMEDIATELY RE-FORMED IN EQUAL QUANTITY

AND IT WILL BE SO SOME NEAR DAY CHAPTER XXIII MISCELLANEOUS INVENTIONS IT HAS BEEN THE ENDEAVOR IN THIS NARRATIVE TO GROUP EDISON'S INVENTIONS AND PATENTS SO THAT HIS WORK IN THE DIFFERENT FIELDS CAN BE STUDIED INDEPENDENTLY AND SEPARATELY
IT WAS DURING EDISON'S WINTER STAY IN FLORIDA IN MARCH 1909
THROUGH ALL HIS TRAVELS EDISON HAS PRESERVED THOSE BOOKS AND HAS THEM NOW IN HIS LIBRARY AT LLEWELLYN PARK ON ORANGE MOUNTAIN NEW JERSEY
AS A MATTER OF FACT AS MANY AS THREE THOUSAND COPIES HAVE BEEN MADE FROM A SINGLE MIMEOGRAPHIC STENCIL OF THIS CHARACTER
ITS ATTRACTIVE POWER DRAWS THE ARMATURE TOWARD THE POLES

IN AMERICA IN 1840 MORSE HAD TAKEN OUT HIS FIRST PATENT ON AN ELECTROMAGNETIC TELEGRAPH THE PRINCIPLE OF WHICH IS DOMINATING IN THE ART TO THIS DAY
AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND NOTABLE PEOPLE OF THAT CITY CAME ALL DAY LONG UNTIL LATE IN THE EVENING
JOHNSON WHO REPRESENTED EDISON THERE WENT TO ENGLAND FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF THIS TELEPHONE ENTERPRISE MR CHARLES EDISON A NEPHEW OF THE INVENTOR
EDISON'S FIRST MODEL OF THE PHONOGRAPH IS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATION
AT SUCH A MOMENT THIS GIFT OF DESPOILED ITALY TO THE WORLD WAS A NOBLE REVENGE SETTING IN MOTION INCALCULABLE BENEFICENT FORCES AND AGENCIES
IT IS BELIEVED THAT FROM THE OTHER CHAPTERS OF THIS BOOK THE READER CAN FORMULATE HIS OWN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
WE WATCHED PATIENTLY FOR THOSE INSPECTORS TO APPEAR
WHEN THE WIRES FROM THE VIBRATOR AND THE GAS-PIPE WERE CONNECTED SLIGHT CONTRACTIONS WERE NOTED SOMETIMES VERY PLAIN AND MARKED SHOWING THE APPARENT PRESENCE OF ELECTRICITY WHICH FROM THE HIGH INSULATION SEEMED IMPROBABLE
IT HAS BEEN IN PRACTICAL USE FOR MANY YEARS ON SOME OF THE LEADING RAILROADS OF THE UNITED STATES
IN A NARRATIVE NOT INTENDED TO BE STRICTLY TECHNICAL IT WOULD PROBABLY TIRE THE READER TO FOLLOW THIS MATERIAL IN DETAIL THROUGH THE NUMEROUS STEPS ATTENDING THE MAGNETIC SEPARATION
THE ARTIFICIAL LINE AS WELL AS THAT TO WHICH THE TWO COILS ARE JOINED ARE CONNECTED TO EARTH
ONE DAY WHILE I WAS CARRYING ON MY WORK IN NEWARK A WALL STREET BROKER CAME FROM THE CITY AND SAID HE WAS TIRED OF THE STREET AND WANTED TO GO INTO SOMETHING REAL
WHEN I MISSED UNDERSTANDING A WORD THERE WAS NO TIME TO THINK WHAT IT WAS SO I MADE AN ILLEGIBLE ONE TO FILL IN TRUSTING TO THE PRINTERS TO SENSE IT
APRIL 25 1890 437,428 PROPELLING DEVICE FOR ELECTRIC CARS
THE TUBE ITSELF SHOULD HAVE A THIN COATING
WHAT
HE SEEMED ONLY TOO PLEASED TO DO THIS AND IT WAS CLOSED
EVEN THE SCENERY IS AUSTERE
ON THE FACE OF IT HE WAS SEEMINGLY GIFTED WITH MORE THAN HUMAN PRESCIENCE FOR IN AT LEAST ONE OF HIS EXHIBIT LAMPS SAID TO HAVE BEEN MADE TWENTY YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE CLAIMED TO HAVE EMPLOYED PROCESSES WHICH EDISON AND HIS ASSOCIATES HAD ONLY DEVELOPED BY SEVERAL YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN MAKING THOUSANDS OF LAMPS
IF WE TAKE THAT FOR THE DEFENDANT THE CENTRAL GLASS COMPANY MACHINE AND ESPECIALLY THE KUNY KAHBEL MACHINE BUILT AND OPERATED YEARS BEFORE THIS PATENT ISSUED AND NOT PATENTED ARE JUST AS GOOD JUST AS EFFECTIVE AND PRACTICAL AS THIS ONE AND CAPABLE OF TURNING OUT JUST AS PERFECT WORK AND AS GREAT A VARIETY OF IT
IT WAS FURTHER INQUIRED INTO IN 1892 IN THE CASE AGAINST THE SAWYER-MAN COMPANY
EDISON WAS OFF IN A MINUTE JUMPING AND LAUGHING AND DECLARING IT A MOST BEAUTIFUL ACCIDENT
THESE PIECES WERE THEN CRUSHED BY POWER DIRECTLY APPLIED
THIS EPOCHAL STORY WILL BE TOLD IN THE NEXT CHAPTER
ANY OTHER MAN THAN EDISON WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE WHOLE THING UP A THOUSAND TIMES BUT NOT HE
IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THIS INVENTION THE HIGHEST STATE OF THE ART OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION WAS REPRESENTED BY EDISON'S FEEDER SYSTEM WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED AS A STRAIGHT PARALLEL OR MULTIPLE-ARC SYSTEM WHEREIN ECONOMY OF COPPER WAS OBTAINED BY USING SEPARATE SETS OF CONDUCTORS--MINUS LOAD--FEEDING CURRENT AT STANDARD POTENTIAL OR ELECTRICAL PRESSURE INTO THE MAINS AT CENTRES OF DISTRIBUTION
MR CALLAHAN REMOVED THE TWO DIALS AND SUBSTITUTING TYPE WHEELS TURNED THE MOVEMENTS FACE TO FACE SO THAT EACH TYPE WHEEL COULD IMPRINT ITS CHARACTERS UPON A PAPER TAPE IN TWO LINES
THE STANDARD KILNS THEN IN USE WERE ABOUT SIXTY FEET IN LENGTH WITH AN INTERNAL DIAMETER OF ABOUT FIVE FEET
THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT ABOUT IT AND TWO VOTES HAD BEEN TAKEN IN THE CONVENTION ON THE TWO DAYS
BUT THIS RESULT DID NOT LEAVE THE VALUE OF THE DEVICE IN DOUBT
AT MENLO PARK ONE DAY A FARMER CAME IN AND ASKED IF I KNEW ANY WAY TO KILL POTATO-BUGS
IT ALSO HAD A MEASURING SYSTEM FOR THE CURRENT EMPLOYING THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METER
THESE CORES WERE THEN ALLOWED TO RUN IN AN EXCITED FIELD AND AFTER A GIVEN TIME THEIR TEMPERATURE WAS MEASURED AND NOTED

AND THEY WERE ARRANGED IN BATTERIES OF VARIED MAGNETIC STRENGTH IN ORDER THAT THE INTERMINGLED MASS OF CRUSHED ROCK AND IRON ORE MIGHT BE MORE THOROUGHLY SEPARATED BY BEING PASSED THROUGH MAGNETIC FIELDS OF SUCCESSIVELY INCREASING DEGREES OF ATTRACTING POWER
EDISON HATES NOTHING MORE THAN TO BE DUBBED A GENIUS OR PLAYED UP AS A WIZARD
THE THOUGHT THEN OCCURRED TO EDISON THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THE FROG WAS DUE TO MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS FROM THE VIBRATOR WHICH GIVES PROBABLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY VIBRATIONS PER SECOND PASSING THROUGH THE WIRES AND IRRITATING THE SENSITIVE NERVES OF THE FROG
CHAPTER XIX MAGNETIC ORE MILLING WORK DURING THE HUDSON-FULTON CELEBRATION OF OCTOBER 1909 BURGOMASTER VAN LEEUWEN OF AMSTERDAM MEMBER OF THE DELEGATION SENT OFFICIALLY FROM HOLLAND TO ESCORT THE HALF MOON AND PARTICIPATE IN THE FUNCTIONS OF THE ANNIVERSARY PAID A VISIT TO THE EDISON LABORATORY AT ORANGE TO SEE THE INVENTOR WHO MAY BE REGARDED AS PRE-EMINENT AMONG THOSE OF DUTCH DESCENT IN THIS COUNTRY
THE BUILDING WAS SIX STORIES HIGH
THE THREE-WIRE SYSTEM THIS INVENTION IS COVERED BY UNITED STATES PATENT NO
THIS I INVENTED AS WELL.--T
THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WHEN ONE OF THE RECEIVING OPERATORS IS COMPELLED TO BREAK THE SENDING OPERATOR FOR ANY REASON THE BREAK CAUSES THE INTERRUPTION OF THE WORK OF EIGHT OPERATORS INSTEAD OF TWO AS WOULD BE THE CASE ON A SINGLE WIRE
THE AGGLOMERATED PRODUCT MUST BE POROUS SO AS TO AFFORD ACCESS OF THE FURNACE-REDUCING GASES TO THE ORE
THIS NIGHT JOB JUST SUITED ME AS I COULD HAVE THE WHOLE DAY TO MYSELF
THUS CONTRARY TO THE STORIES THAT HAVE BEEN SO WIDELY PUBLISHED THE EDISONS WHILE NOT RICH BY ANY MEANS WERE IN COMFORTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH A WELL-STOCKED FARM AND LARGE ORCHARD TO DRAW UPON ALSO FOR SUSTENANCE
UNDOUBTEDLY IN THE DAYS TO COME EDISON WILL NOT ONLY BE RECOGNIZED AS AN INTELLECTUAL PRODIGY BUT AS A PRODIGY OF INDUSTRY--OF HARD WORK
OF THE MOTIVE WORK PRODUCED AFTER DEDUCTION IS MADE FOR FRICTION AND THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIR THEY REPORTED ALSO THAT THE BRUSH ARC LIGHTING MACHINE PRODUCES IN THE LUMINOUS ARC USEFUL WORK EQUIVALENT TO 31 PER CENT
AT THAT TIME I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF ELECTRICITY
THUS THE PAPER PASSED BETWEEN THE DRUM AND THE TWO SMALL WHEELS AND AS DRY PAPER IS A NON-CONDUCTOR CURRENT WAS PREVENTED FROM PASSING UNTIL A PERFORATION WAS REACHED
THE READER WILL SEE FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THIS LIST THAT THE YEARS 1880 1881 1882 AND 1883 WERE THE MOST PROLIFIC PERIODS OF INVENTION
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE MUCH SHOW
AND DURING MY CONNECTION WITH THAT MISSION I WAS AT ALL TIMES NOT LESS ASTONISHED AT MR EDISON'S QUICK PERCEPTION OF CONDITIONS AND HIS INSTANT DECISION AND HIS BIGNESS OF CONCEPTIONS THAN I HAD ALWAYS BEEN WITH HIS PRODIGIOUS INDUSTRY AND HIS INVENTIVE GENIUS
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECT EDISON INTRODUCED ANOTHER AND DISTINCT FEATURE--NAMELY THE USING OF THE SAME CURRENT BUT ALSO VARYING ITS DIRECTION OF FLOW
THE QUADRUPLEX HOWEVER HAS OTHER MATERIAL ADVANTAGES BUT HOW FAR THEY AND THE NATURAL GROWTH OF THE BUSINESS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INVESTMENT AND EARNINGS OF THE TELEGRAPH COMPANIES IS BEYOND PRACTICABLE COMPUTATION

AND SECOND THE PRODUCTION OF A CAMERA CAPABLE OF SO TAKING THE PICTURES
TO SHOW WHAT THEY MEAN HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE NOTED THAT NEW YORK CITY ALONE HAS 3000 STOCK TICKERS CONSUMING 50,000 MILES OF RECORD TAPE EVERY YEAR
THEY CHASED ME TO THE HOUSE
BUT THE SPIRIT OF COAL HAD DEMONSTRATED ITS USEFULNESS CONVINCINGLY AND A COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT BEGAN WHICH FOR EXTENT AND RAPIDITY WAS NOT INFERIOR TO THAT MARKING THE CONCURRENT ADOPTION OF STEAM IN INDUSTRY AND TRANSPORTATION
AT THE PRESENT TIME THE ANNUAL SALES OF THE BUSINESS PHONOGRAPHS AND SUPPLIES CYLINDERS ETC ARE NOT LESS THAN $350,000
IF THE DIRECTION IS REVERSED THE POLARITY WILL ALSO BE REVERSED
THE OLD MAN SAID TO HIM ONE DAY
AND THE WORK THEN EXECUTED HAS HELD ITS OWN EVER SINCE FROM THE BEGINNING OF HIS EXPERIMENTS ON ELECTRIC LIGHT MR EDISON HAD A WELL-DEFINED IDEA OF PRODUCING NOT ONLY A PRACTICABLE LAMP BUT ALSO A SYSTEM OF COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC LIGHTING
GELATINE 4 LBS
THE STEAM PRESSURE WAS LIMITED TO SEVENTY-FIVE POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH
MOTT AND CHARLES T
SIMPLY BECAUSE IF ICE SANK TO THE BOTTOMS OF RIVERS LAKES AND OCEANS AS FAST AS IT FROZE THOSE PLACES WOULD BE FROZEN UP AND THERE WOULD BE NO WATER LEFT
THUS HE WAS NOT CONFUSED BY THE AMOUNT OF WIRE AND THE THOUGHT OF DISTANCE THE IMMENSE DIFFICULTIES OF REDUCING SUCH A SYSTEM TO PRACTICE MAY BE READILY CONCEIVED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED THAT THE LINE ITSELF RUNNING ACROSS HUNDREDS OF MILES OF COUNTRY IS SUBJECT TO ALL MANNER OF ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AND VARIES FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT IN ITS ABILITY TO CARRY CURRENT AND ALSO WHEN IT IS BORNE IN MIND THAT THE QUADRUPLEX REQUIRES AT EACH END OF THE LINE A SO-CALLED ARTIFICIAL LINE WHICH MUST HAVE THE EXACT RESISTANCE OF THE WORKING LINE AND MUST BE VARIED WITH THE VARIATIONS IN RESISTANCE OF THE WORKING LINE
WE NOW CONNECTED A WIRE TO X THE END OF THE VIBRATING ROD AND WE FOUND WE COULD GET A SPARK FROM IT BY TOUCHING A PIECE OF IRON TO IT AND ONE OF THE MOST CURIOUS PHENOMENA IS THAT IF YOU TURN THE WIRE AROUND ON ITSELF AND LET THE POINT OF THE WIRE TOUCH ANY OTHER PORTION OF ITSELF YOU GET A SPARK
HE HAD MADE A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS THROUGHOUT THESE VARIOUS TRIALS HOWEVER AND AS WE CONTINUED TO OPERATE WE LEARNED ADDITIONAL POINTS IN HANDLING AND WERE ABLE TO GET THE OUTPUT UP TO NINE HUNDRED BARRELS THEN ONE THOUSAND AND FINALLY TO OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED BARRELS PER DAY THUS MORE THAN REALIZING THE PREDICTION MADE BY MR EDISON BEFORE EVEN THE PLANS WERE DRAWN
VILLARD MADE HIS GREAT RALLY
ITS HIGH PRACTICAL EFFICIENCY
WE BORED A HOLE THROUGH THE ROOF AND COULD SEE THE MEN AS THEY CAME IN
A DYNAMO WAS INSTALLED IN BERGMANN'S SHOP TO PERMIT HIM TO TEST THE VARIOUS SMALL DEVICES WHICH HE WAS THEN MAKING FOR THE SYSTEM
ALL THESE INVENTIONS AND DEVICES AS WELL AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL ABOVE EXCEPT MAGNETIC SEPARATORS AND MIXING AND BRIQUETTING MACHINES ARE BEING USED BY HIM TO-DAY IN THE MANUFACTURE OF PORTLAND CEMENT AS THAT INDUSTRY PRESENTS MANY OF THE IDENTICAL PROBLEMS WHICH PRESENTED THEMSELVES IN RELATION TO THE CONCENTRATION OF IRON ORE
THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MR EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
THESE FORMED A FOUNDATION
FOOTNOTE 29
I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH FAITH THAT IT WOULD WORK EXPECTING THAT I MIGHT POSSIBLY HEAR A WORD OR SO THAT WOULD GIVE HOPE OF A FUTURE FOR THE IDEA
AS IT IS DESIRED TO PRINT FROM ONLY ONE TYPE-WHEEL AT A TIME IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO SHIFT THEM BACK AND FORTH FROM TIME TO TIME IN ORDER TO BRING THE DESIRED CHARACTERS IN LINE WITH THE PAPER TAPE
IF HE WANTED MATERIAL HE ALWAYS MADE IT A PRINCIPLE TO HAVE IT AT ONCE AND NEVER HESITATED TO USE SPECIAL MESSENGERS TO GET IT
BOTH CONTRIBUTING TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRY
MEANWHILE THE TYPE-WHEELS ARE ROTATING CARRYING WITH THEM THE ROCKING-LEVER AND CURRENT IS PULSATING OVER BOTH CIRCUITS
IN THE EARLY PART OF 1881 THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY LEASED THE OLD BISHOP MANSION AT 65 FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FOURTEENTH STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW-ROOMS
AND HIS PLANS WERE LAID WITH A VIEW TO EXERCISING THE UTMOST ECONOMY IN THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE PLANT IN WHICH HE CONTEMPLATED THE AUTOMATIC HANDLING OF MANY THOUSANDS OF TONS OF MATERIAL DAILY
WE NOW FOUND THAT IF WE TOUCHED ANY METALLIC PART OF THE VIBRATOR OR MAGNET WE GOT THE SPARK
HE WAS GETTING $21.50 PER WEEK AND WAS ALSO PAID FOR OVERTIME
TAR FROM PASSING CHLORINE THROUGH ANILINE OIL 2 LBS
WE HAD A MAN WITH US AT MENLO CALLED SEGREDOR
IN ONE OF THE LARGER ALCOVES AT THE SUNNY END OF THE MAIN HALL IS EDISON'S OWN DESK WHERE HE MAY USUALLY BE SEEN FOR A WHILE IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS LOOKING OVER HIS MAIL OR OTHERWISE BUSILY WORKING ON MATTERS REQUIRING HIS ATTENTION
THE DEPARTMENT IS OF CONSIDERABLE EXTENT INCLUDING A NUMBER OF RESIDENT AND OTHER ASSOCIATE COUNSEL AND A GENERAL OFFICE STAFF ALL OF WHOM ARE CONSTANTLY ENGAGED FROM DAY TO DAY IN PATENT LITIGATION AND OTHER LEGAL WORK NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE EDISON INTERESTS
THIS DIFFERENCE IN WEIGHT IS A VERY EXACT MEASURE OF THE QUANTITY OF ELECTRICITY OR NUMBER OF AMPERE-HOURS THAT HAVE SO TO SPEAK PASSED THROUGH THE CELL AND HENCE OF THE WHOLE CONSUMPTION IN THE CIRCUIT
IF EXPERIMENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL VILLARD TO PAY ACTUAL OUTLAY IN EXPERIMENTS AND TO TREAT WITH THE LIGHT COMPANY FOR THE INSTALLATION OF AT LEAST FIFTY MILES OF ELECTRIC RAILROAD IN THE WHEAT REGIONS MR EDISON IS AUTHORITY FOR THE STATEMENT THAT MR VILLARD ADVANCED BETWEEN $35,000 AND $40,000 AND THAT THE WORK DONE WAS VERY SATISFACTORY
HAVING DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THE MOUNTAIN REGIONS OF NEW JERSEY I CONSTRUCTED A VERY SENSITIVE MAGNETIC NEEDLE WHICH WOULD DIP TOWARD THE EARTH IF BROUGHT OVER ANY CONSIDERABLE BODY OF MAGNETIC IRON ORE
IT WAS TAKEN BY THE OPERATOR ON THE OTHER TABLE DIRECT FROM THE WAR DEPARTMENT
ON SUCH OCCASIONS AN INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY IS OFFERED TO STUDY EDISON IN HIS INTENSE AND CONSTRUCTIVE MOODS
THE AMERICAN WHALING FLEET WHICH AT THE TIME OF EDISON'S BIRTH MUSTERED OVER SEVEN HUNDRED SAIL HAD DWINDLED PROBABLY TO A BARE TENTH WHEN HE TOOK UP THE PROBLEM OF ILLUMINATION
ACHESON AND HIPPLE AND ONE OR TWO OTHER ASSISTANTS AT THE CLOSE OF THE EXPOSITION TRANSFERRED THEIR ENERGIES TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT OF MACHINE-SHOPS AND LAMP FACTORIES AT IVRY-SUR-SEINE FOR THE COMPANY AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE INSTALLATION OF PLANTS BEGAN IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES--FRANCE ITALY HOLLAND BELGIUM ETC
A VERY NOVEL LITERARY FEATURE OF THE WORK WAS THE ISSUANCE OF A BULLETIN DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO THE EDISON LIGHTING PROPAGANDA
EDISON HAD A NUMBER OF SMALL WOODEN CORES MADE AT BOTH ENDS OF WHICH WE INSERTED LITTLE BRASS NAILS AND WE WOUND THE WOODEN CORES WITH TWINE AS IF IT WERE WIRE ON AN ARMATURE
I WENT THERE AND FOUND OVER EIGHTY CELLS OF THE WELL-KNOWN GROVE NITRIC-ACID BATTERY
THE FINANCIAL FORTUNES OF THE BATTERY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC WERE AS VARIED AND AS DISASTROUS AS ITS INDUSTRIAL
HENCE THE NEXT FIGURE 4 WITH ITS ACCOMPANYING EXPLANATION WILL PROBABLY MAKE THE MATTER CLEAR
THE YOUNG OPERATORS THEREFORE VISITED ANOTHER SHIPPING-OFFICE TO MAKE INQUIRIES AS TO VESSELS FOR BRAZIL AND ENCOUNTERED AN OLD SPANIARD WHO SAT IN A CHAIR NEAR THE STEAMER AGENT'S DESK AND TO WHOM THEY EXPLAINED THEIR INTENTIONS
1 WIRE THAT I WORKED IN BOSTON THERE WAS AN OPERATOR NAMED JERRY BORST AT THE OTHER END
THE BATTERY-ROOM WAS FILLED WITH OLD RECORD-BOOKS AND MESSAGE BUNDLES AND ONE HUNDRED CELLS OF NITRIC-ACID BATTERY ARRANGED ON A STAND IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM
IN THIS DIAGRAM A REPRESENTS AN OUTER LIGHT-TIGHT BOX CONTAINING A LENS C AND THE OTHER NECESSARY MECHANISM FOR MAKING THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EXPOSURES H<1S> AND H<2S> BEING CASES FOR HOLDING REELS OF FILM BEFORE AND AFTER EXPOSURE F THE LONG TAPE-LIKE FILM G A SPROCKET WHOSE TEETH ENGAGE IN PERFORATIONS ON THE EDGES OF THE FILM SUCH SPROCKET BEING ADAPTED TO BE REVOLVED WITH AN INTERMITTENT OR STEP-BY-STEP MOVEMENT BY HAND OR BY MOTOR AND B A REVOLVING SHUTTER HAVING AN OPENING AND CONNECTED BY GEARS WITH G AND ARRANGED TO EXPOSE THE FILM DURING THE PERIODS OF REST
BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO IDEA OF SETTING FORTH VARIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS OR OF ASCRIBING DISTINCTIVE MERITS
RESTING ON THE CYLINDER WAS A PALLADIUM-FACED PEN OR SPRING WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO A MICA DIAPHRAGM IN A RESONATOR
ON LAND THIS EARTH CONNECTION WOULD BE ONE OF USUAL CHARACTER IN TELEGRAPHY
THIS GROUND MATERIAL PASSES THROUGH KILNS AND COMES OUT IN CLINKER THIS IS GROUND AND THAT PART OF THIS FINELY GROUND CLINKER THAT WILL PASS A 200-MESH SCREEN IS CEMENT
IT WAS ALL IN VAIN HOWEVER FOR THE DECISION OF THE COURT WAS IN FAVOR OF EDISON AND HIS LAMP PATENT WAS SUSTAINED NOT ONLY BY THE TRIBUNAL OF THE FIRST RESORT BUT ALSO BY THE APPELLATE COURT SOME TIME AFTERWARD
WAGONS WERE ALSO LOADED WITH LIGHT POLES SUPPLIED WITH AN IRON SPIKE AT EACH END TO HOLD THE WIRES UP
I HAD SOLD ALL I HAD
A GREAT DEAL OF THIS NARRATIVE IS GIVEN IN MR EDISON'S OWN LANGUAGE FROM ORAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENTS MADE IN REPLY TO QUESTIONS ADDRESSED TO HIM WITH THE OBJECT OF SECURING ACCURACY
SUCH SINCERE ADVICE AS THIS COULD NOT BE DISDAINED AND EDISON MADE HIS WAY NORTH AGAIN
HENCE IF WE CONNECT ONE POLE OF A BATTERY WITH THE EARTH AND FROM THE OTHER POLE RUN TO THE EARTH TWO WIRES OF EQUAL RESISTANCE AS ILLUSTRATED IN FIG
SUPPOSE A MAN SPEAKS NEAR A MOVABLE DISK SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE TO LOSE NONE OF THE VIBRATIONS OF THE VOICE
SUCH A RECONNAISSANCE LIKE THAT OF A COMING FIELD OF BATTLE WAS INVALUABLE AND MAY HELP GIVE A FURTHER IDEA OF THE MAN'S INVETERATE CARE FOR THE MINUTIAE OF THINGS
BUT HE DIDN'T REACH THE RED ROACH

A DAY OR TWO LATER MR EDISON INQUIRED
EDISON'S MODESTY HAS ALLOWED US BUT ONE REMARK ON THE SUBJECT
AS THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EXPERIMENTS SHOWN BY THESE EXTRACTS MAY NOT BE APPARENT TO A LAY READER IT MAY BE STATED BY WAY OF PREMISE THAT ORDINARILY A CURRENT ONLY FOLLOWS A CLOSED CIRCUIT
WHEN THE DRUM ROTATED THE FRICTION OF THE PAD CARRIED THE VIBRATING ARM FORWARD BUT AN ELECTRICAL IMPULSE COMING OVER THE LINE WOULD DECOMPOSE THE CHEMICAL SOLUTION WITH WHICH THE DRUM WAS MOISTENED CAUSING AN EFFECT SIMILAR TO LUBRICATION AND THUS ALLOWING THE PAD TO SLIP BACKWARD FREELY IN RESPONSE TO THE PULL OF ITS RETRACTILE SPRING

THE COMPARATIVELY SHORT LENGTH OF THE SIXTY-FOOT KILN NOT ONLY LIMITED THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THAT COULD BE FED INTO IT BUT THE LIMITATION IN LENGTH OF THE COMBUSTION ZONE MILITATED AGAINST A THOROUGH CLINKERING OF THE MATERIAL THIS OPERATION BEING ONE IN WHICH THE ELEMENTS OF TIME AND PROPER HEAT ARE PRIME CONSIDERATIONS
WHEN IT GOT VERY COLD THE METAL WOULD CONTRACT AND CLOSE A CIRCUIT AND THROW A LAMP INTO CIRCUIT INSIDE THE METER
BUT SUCH OCCASIONAL INCIDENTS TEND IN NO WISE TO LESSEN EDISON'S WARM ADMIRATION OF THE PRESS OR HIS READINESS TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF IT WHENEVER A REPRESENTATIVE GOES OVER TO ORANGE TO GET THE TRUTH OR THE REAL FACTS IN REGARD TO ANY MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE
EDISON AND HIS COMPANY THEREFORE REJECTED THE OFFER UNCONDITIONALLY AND DECLINED TO ENTER INTO ANY ARRANGEMENTS WHATEVER WITH GOEBEL
BUT EDISON PROMISED NOT TO BRING IN ANYTHING OF A DANGEROUS NATURE
NEW FORCE.--THE FOLLOWING VERY CURIOUS RESULT WAS OBTAINED WITH IT
WHEN I WENT WITH BORST AND ANOTHER OPERATOR THEY POINTED OUT TWO OR THREE MEN WHO WERE THEN CELEBRATED IN THE NEWSPAPER WORLD
AGAIN IN EXPERIMENTING ON THE TELEPHONE I HAD TO IMPROVE THE TRANSMITTER SO I COULD HEAR IT
THEY WANTED ME TO PUT UP A LITTLE MONEY AND START THEM IN A SHOP IN NEW YORK TO MAKE REPAIRS ETC
BUT IN THE AUTOMATIC THE AIM WAS TO DEAL WITH IMPULSES FOLLOWING EACH OTHER FROM TWENTY-FIVE TO ONE HUNDRED TIMES AS RAPIDLY AS IN MORSE LINES AND TO ATTEMPT TO RECEIVE AND RECORD INTELLIGIBLY SUCH A LIGHTNING-LIKE SUCCESSION OF SIGNALS WOULD HAVE SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
AS THIS WAS A PRETTY SERIOUS PROBLEM AND AS WE HAD A GOOD MANY OF THE MANHOLES IT WORRIED ME VERY MUCH FOR FEAR THAT IT WOULD BE REPEATED AND THE COMPANY MIGHT HAVE TO PAY A LOT OF DAMAGES ESPECIALLY IN DISTRICTS LIKE THAT AROUND WILLIAM AND NASSAU WHERE THERE ARE A GOOD MANY PEOPLE ABOUT
EDISON HAS STRONG CONVICTIONS ON THE LIBERAL USE OF LUBRICANTS BUT ARGUED THAT IN THE ORDINARY OILING OF MACHINERY THERE IS GREAT WASTE WHILE MUCH DIRT IS CONVEYED INTO THE BEARINGS

I FOUND HIM AT A BENCH ABOUT THREE FEET WIDE AND TWELVE TO FIFTEEN FEET LONG ON WHICH THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF LITTLE TEST CELLS THAT HAD BEEN MADE UP BY HIS CORPS OF CHEMISTS AND EXPERIMENTERS
IN 1896 AT THE ELECTRICAL EXHIBITION IN THE GRAND CENTRAL PALACE NEW YORK CITY GIVEN UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WITH THE USE OF THIS APPARATUS IN EDISON'S PERSONAL EXHIBIT WERE ENABLED TO SEE THEIR OWN BONES
I FOUND SEVERAL BEAUTIFUL DIAMONDS BUT THEY SEEMED A LITTLE LIGHT WEIGHT TO ME WHEN I WAS PICKING THEM OUT
WHEN EDISON WAS PREPARING TO GO INTO THE CEMENT BUSINESS HE LOOKED THE GROUND OVER THOROUGHLY AND AFTER CONSIDERABLE INVESTIGATION AND EXPERIMENT CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT PREVAILING CONDITIONS AS TO KILNS WERE FAR FROM IDEAL
THE SLEEPERS WERE LAID UPON THE NATURAL GRADE AND THERE WAS COMPARATIVELY NO EFFORT MADE TO BALLAST THE ROAD
THE CIRCUITS WERE OPENED AND CLOSED BY MEANS OF ABOUT HALF A DOZEN ROUGHLY MADE PLUG-SWITCHES
THE BOX WOULD BE PLACED ON THE TABLE WHERE THE SNORER WAS SLEEPING AND THE CRANK TURNED RAPIDLY
THE TOTAL WEIGHT OF COPPER FOR THE FOUR QUARTER DISTRICTS BY THE TREE SYSTEM WAS 803,250 POUNDS BUT WHEN THE FEEDER SYSTEM WAS USED IT WAS ONLY 128,739 POUNDS
THE OFFICE WAS NEVER CLEANED
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE EVENT WE ALL GOT TOGETHER AND OBTAINING AN ENGINE AND CAR WENT TWELVE MILES FARTHER WEST TO VISIT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ASTRONOMERS AT A PLACE CALLED SEPARATION THE APEX OF THE GREAT DIVIDE WHERE THE WATERS RUN EAST TO THE MISSISSIPPI AND WEST TO THE PACIFIC
THE RELAY IS ADJUSTED TO THE WEAKER CURRENTS LIKELY TO BE RECEIVED BUT THE SIGNALS REPRODUCED ON THE SOUNDER BY THE AGENCY OF THE RELAY ARE OF COURSE ALL OF EQUAL STRENGTH AS THEY DEPEND UPON THE LOCAL BATTERY WHICH HAS ONLY THIS STEADY WORK TO PERFORM
SOMETIMES THE SUBJECT MAY BE SUCH AS TO CALL FOR A LONG LINE OF FREQUENT TESTS WHICH NECESSITATE PATIENT AND ACCURATE ATTENTION TO MINUTE DETAILS
THE IDEA OF THE TICKER DID NOT ORIGINATE WITH EDISON AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN CHAPTER VII OF THE PRECEDING NARRATIVE BUT AT THE TIME OF HIS EMPLOYMENT WITH THE WESTERN UNION IN BOSTON IN 1868 THE CRUDITIES OF THE EARLIER FORMS MADE AN IMPRESSION ON HIS PRACTICAL MIND AND HE GOT OUT AN IMPROVED INSTRUMENT OF HIS OWN WHICH HE INTRODUCED IN BOSTON THROUGH THE AID OF A PROFESSIONAL PROMOTER
WHATEVER KNOWLEDGE I MAY HAVE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER INDUSTRY I FEEL I OWE IT TO THE TUITION OF EDISON
SOME PARTIES HEARING I HAD SUCCEEDED IN DOING SUCH A THING WENT TO WORK AND GOT HOLD OF WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE ORTIZ MINE GRANT TWELVE MILES FROM SANTA FE NEW MEXICO
IT IS THE COMMON EXPERIENCE OF ANY VISITOR TO THE LABORATORY THAT THERE ARE USUALLY SEVERAL PERSONS AHEAD OF HIM NO MATTER WHAT THE HOUR OF THE DAY AND SOME WHOSE BUSINESS HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY VITAL TO GET THEM INSIDE THE PORTER'S GATE OR EVEN INTO THE BIG LIBRARY AND LOUNGING-ROOM
IT WAS THUS MADE IMPOSSIBLE FOR EITHER DIAL TO GO BY MOMENTUM BEYOND ITS LIMIT
FROM 1880 TO 1885 WHILE STILL VERY BUSY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS ELECTRIC-LIGHT SYSTEM EDISON FOUND OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN CRUSHING AND SEPARATING MACHINERY
THE PLACE HAD A BAR AND SIX BARE TABLES AND WAS SIMPLY INFESTED WITH ROACHES
TO THE SAME END HE INTENDED TO SUPPLY STEAM TO THE ENGINE UNDER A MUCH HIGHER BOILER PRESSURE THAN WAS CUSTOMARY IN STATIONARY-ENGINE DRIVING AT THAT TIME THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FIRST ONE OF THESE LARGE MACHINES WAS COMMENCED LATE IN THE YEAR 1880
AND WHILE THEIR CONVERSATION PROCEEDED EDISON SLIPPED QUIETLY OUT OF THE ROOM HURRIED TO THE GRAND TRUNK FREIGHT DEPOT FOUND A CONDUCTOR HE KNEW TAKING OUT A FREIGHT TRAIN FOR SARNIA AND WAS NOT HAPPY UNTIL THE FERRY-BOAT FROM SARNIA HAD LANDED HIM ONCE MORE ON THE MICHIGAN SHORE
WHILE THE HUGE OPEN FIREPLACE SURMOUNTED BY A GREAT CLOCK BUILT INTO THE WALL AT ONE END OF THE ROOM THE LARGE RUGS THE ARM-CHAIRS SCATTERED AROUND THE TABLES AND CHAIRS IN THE ALCOVES GIVE A GENERAL AIR OF COMFORT COMBINED WITH UTILITY
THE INVESTORS IN THE ENTERPRISE WERE READY AND ANXIOUS TO MEET THE EXTRA COST OF PUTTING THE WIRES UNDERGROUND
OTHERS WERE GLADLY WELCOMED LIKE LORD KELVIN THE GREATEST PHYSICIST OF THE LAST CENTURY WITH WHOM EDISON WAS ALWAYS IN FRIENDLY COMMUNICATION
976 ET SEQ BELL'S PATENT OF 1876 WAS OF AN ALL-EMBRACING CHARACTER WHICH ONLY THE MAKE-AND-BREAK PRINCIPLE IF PRACTICAL COULD HAVE ESCAPED
AND EDISON'S CONVICTIONS ARE GRANITIC
A LITTLE INCIDENT BEARS ON THIS POINT
IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP MECHANICS ON ACCOUNT OF INDIFFERENT RESIDENTIAL ACCOMMODATIONS AFFORDED BY THE TINY VILLAGE REMOTE FROM CIVILIZATION AMONG THE CENTRAL MOUNTAINS OF NEW JERSEY

A STRONG CHARACTERIZATION OF THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK DONE BY EDISON IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARBON TRANSMITTER WILL BE FOUND IN THE DECISION OF JUDGE BROWN IN THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS SITTING IN BOSTON ON FEBRUARY 27 1901 DECLARING VOID THE FAMOUS BERLINER PATENT OF THE BELL TELEPHONE SYSTEM
TWOMBLY CLOSED THE CONTRACT WITH US FOR A PLANT
AT THESE NEW WORKS OUR ORDERS WERE FAR IN EXCESS OF OUR CAPITAL TO HANDLE THE BUSINESS AND BOTH MR INSULL AND I WERE AFRAID WE MIGHT GET INTO TROUBLE FOR LACK OF MONEY
IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT BESIDES THE SYSTEM ILLUSTRATED IN FIG

HOWEVER THE CONTRACT WAS HANDED TO ME
IN SHARP CONTRAST TO HIM WAS THE EARNEST SERIOUS ROWLAND OF JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY AFTERWARD THE LEADING AMERICAN PHYSICIST OF HIS DAY
THERE ARE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY LAYERS OF EACH KIND OF MATERIAL IN A 4 1/8-INCH TUBE EACH LAYER OF NICKEL HYDRATE BEING ABOUT 0.01 INCH THICK
THENCE THROUGH THE EARTH AT THE RECEIVING END UP TO THE OTHER DRUM AND BACK TO THE BATTERIES VIA THE TELLURIUM PINS 2 OR 4 AND THE LINE WIRE
WE STARTED TO COLLECT SOME BILLS
THEN HE JABBED IT BACK ON THE HOOK AND I KNEW I WAS ALL RIGHT
IN ANY EVENT IT WAS A RIFLE WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ADOPTED BY THE BRITISH ARMY
IT IS TRUE THAT THERE WERE EXPLOSIONS AND DISTINGUISHED MEN LIKE DAVY AND WATT OPINED THAT THE ILLUMINANT WAS TOO DANGEROUS
WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY ASSEMBLED THERE WILL BE A HOLLOW SPACE IN THE INTERIOR REPRESENTING THE SHAPE OF THE HOUSE
SINCE THAT DATE THE INDUSTRY HAS DEVELOPED VERY RAPIDLY AND AT THE PRESENT TIME 1910 ALL OF THE PRINCIPAL AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS OF MOTION PICTURES ARE PAYING A ROYALTY TO EDISON UNDER HIS BASIC PATENTS
AFTER WAITING AN HOUR I WAS TOLD TO COME OVER TO A SPECIAL TABLE AND TAKE A SPECIAL REPORT FOR THE BOSTON HERALD THE CONSPIRATORS HAVING ARRANGED TO HAVE ONE OF THE FASTEST SENDERS IN NEW YORK SEND THE DESPATCH AND SALT THE NEW MAN
A SINGLE DIAMOND PRISMATICALLY FLASHING FROM ITS MANY FACETS THE BEAUTIES OF REFLECTED LIGHT COMES WELL WITHIN THE LIMITS OF COMPREHENSION OF THE HUMAN MIND AND APPEALS TO APPRECIATION BY THE FINER SENSIBILITIES
AS BUSINESS INCREASED HE PUT ON A NIGHT FORCE AND WAS HIS OWN FOREMAN ON BOTH SHIFTS
I HAVE OFTEN BEEN SURPRISED AT EDISON'S WONDERFUL CAPACITY FOR THE INSTANT VISUAL PERCEPTION OF DIFFERENCES IN MATERIALS THAT WERE INVISIBLE TO OTHERS UNTIL HE WOULD PATIENTLY POINT THEM OUT
PUT THAT TOGETHER AND LET ME KNOW WHEN IT'S RUNNING I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS BUT RECEIVED A LIBERAL EDUCATION IN FINDING OUT
THEY WERE ABOUT THE SIZE OF THOSE SEEN IN OLD-FASHIONED COUNTRY HOTELS FOR HOLDING THE WASH-BOWL AND PITCHER
I GENERALLY TRIED TO TURN THEM LOOSE

NO FEWER THAN SIX HUNDRED WAGONS CAME CLATTERING IN AND AS MANY AS TWENTY SAIL VESSELS WERE LOADED WITH THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND BUSHELS OF GRAIN DURING A SINGLE DAY
THE INDUSTRY THRIVED UNDER COMPETITION AND THE ABSENCE OF IT NOW HAD A DECIDED EFFECT IN CHECKING GROWTH
I WAS FORTUNATELY ABSENT AND SHE WAS MOLLIFIED SOMEHOW BY MY OTHER ASSISTANTS
BUT AFTER ALL NOTHING SHORT OF A COMPLETE SYSTEM COULD GIVE REAL VALUE TO THE LAMP AS AN INVENTION
IN FACT HAD HE BEEN LESS VISIONARY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PROSPEROUS BUT MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD A SON SO GIFTED WITH INSIGHT AND IMAGINATION
THE MODERN MEGAPHONE NOW USED UNIVERSALLY IN MAKING ANNOUNCEMENTS TO LARGE CROWDS PARTICULARLY AT SPORTING EVENTS IS ALSO DUE TO THIS PERIOD AS A PERFECTION BY EDISON OF MANY ANTECEDENT DEVICES GOING BACK PERHAPS MUCH FURTHER THAN THE LEGENDARY FUNNELS THROUGH WHICH ALEXANDER THE GREAT IS SAID TO HAVE SENT COMMANDS TO HIS OUTLYING FORCES
THE INSURANCE UNDERWRITERS OF NEW YORK AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY GAVE A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AND STUDY TO THE QUESTION THROUGH THEIR MOST EXPERT REPRESENTATIVES WITH THE AID OF EDISON AND HIS ASSOCIATES OTHER ELECTRIC-LIGHT COMPANIES COOPERATING

THE PRACTICAL INCANDESCENT LAMP WAS BORN
ONE IS THAT THEY MAY BE SPUN OUT ALMOST INTERMINABLY EVEN POSSIBLY TO THE END OF THE LIFE OF THE PATENT
THE FARTHER THEY WENT THE MORE APPREHENSIVE THEY BECAME AND EVERY STUMP IN THE RAVISHED FOREST LOOKED LIKE A BEAR
THIS MIXTURE DESCENDS BY GRAVITY AND GRADUALLY FILLS THE ENTIRE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO SETS OF MOLDS
STILL IT HAD BEEN AN EASY JOB AND ONLY REQUIRED A FEW MONTHS AND I FELT A LITTLE SHAKY AND UNCERTAIN
ITS PRINCIPLE DEPENDS UPON THE VARIABLE RESISTANCE OF CARBON IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DEGREE OF PRESSURE TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECTED
THIS CAPTAIN HAD RETIRED TAKEN UP SOME LUMBER LAND AND HAD CLEARED PART OF IT
THERE IS A TENDENCY TO DENY TO THE CAPITAL THAT THUS TAKES DESPERATE CHANCES ITS FULL REWARD IF THINGS GO RIGHT AND TO INSIST THAT IT SHALL HAVE BARELY THE LEGAL RATE OF INTEREST AND FAR LESS THAN THE RETURN OF OVER-THE-COUNTER RETAIL TRADE
HE HAS ALREADY INVENTED AND PATENTED A NUMBER OF VALUABLE AND USEFUL INVENTIONS AMONG WHICH MAY BE MENTIONED THE BEST INSTRUMENT FOR DOUBLE TRANSMISSION YET BROUGHT OUT NOT BAD FOR A NOVICE OF TWENTY-TWO
AS AN OFFSET THEN TO ANY TENDENCY TO DEPRECIATE THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF EDISON'S LIGHTING WORK LET THE CLAIM BE HERE SET FORTH MODESTLY AND SUBJECT TO INTERFERENCE THAT HE WAS THE FATHER OF UNDERGROUND WIRES IN AMERICA AND BY HIS EXAMPLE OUTLINED THE POLICY NOW DOMINANT IN EVERY CITY OF THE FIRST RANK
WHEN IT IS STATED THAT THE GROSS EARNINGS OF THESE CENTRAL STATIONS APPROXIMATE THE SUM OF $225,000,000 YEARLY THE SIGNIFICANT IMPORT OF THESE STATISTICS OF AN ART THAT CAME SO LARGELY FROM EDISON'S LABORATORY ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE APPARENT

THE FAITH THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS HAD A NEW OPPORTUNITY
IT IS SAID THAT THIS LAMP SHOWS NO TRACES OF MERCURY IN THE BULB BECAUSE THE MERCURY WAS DISTILLED BUT GOEBEL SAYS NOTHING ABOUT DISTILLED MERCURY IN HIS FIRST AFFIDAVIT AND TWICE HE SPEAKS OF THE PARTICLES OF MERCURY CLINGING TO THE INSIDE OF THE CHAMBER AND FOR THAT REASON HE CONSTRUCTED A GEISSLER PUMP AFTER HE MOVED TO 468 GRAND STREET WHICH WAS IN 1877
AND AN IMMEDIATE COMMENCEMENT OF INVESTIGATION AND PROMPT REPORT ARE REQUIRED
ACTUAL TESTS LONG CONTINUED UNDER VERY SEVERE CONDITIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE CONSTRUCTION IS RIGHT AND FULFILS THE MOST SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS MR HOLLAND IN HIS ARTICLE THEN GOES ON TO EXPLAIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NICKEL FLAKES AS THE CONDUCTING FACTOR IN THE POSITIVE ELEMENT BUT AS THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED IN CHAPTER XXII WE SHALL PASS ON TO A LATER POINT WHERE HE SAYS
I RAN TO THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE AND REPORTED THAT I COULD NOT HOLD HER
ABOUT A WEEK AFTERWARD HE WAS FOUND DEAD IN A BARN AT PERTH AMBOY RETURNING TO THE WORK ITSELF NOTE OF WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE IN THIS AND PRECEDING CHAPTERS WE FIND AN INTERESTING AND UNIQUE REMINISCENCE IN MR JEHL'S NOTES OF THE REVERSION TO CARBON AS A FILAMENT IN THE LAMPS FOLLOWING AN EXHIBITION OF METALLIC-FILAMENT LAMPS GIVEN IN THE SPRING OF 1879 TO THE MEN IN THE SYNDICATE ADVANCING THE FUNDS FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS
IN THE CONTROVERSY WHICH APPEARED IN THE COLUMNS OF THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN MR UPTON EDISON'S MATHEMATICIAN TOOK UP THE QUESTION ON HIS SIDE AND ANSWERED THE CRITICS BY FURTHER ELUCIDATIONS OF THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH EDISON HAD FOUNDED SUCH REMARKABLE AND RADICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ART
THESE CONSIDERATIONS TOGETHER WITH HIS LONG-SETTLED PRINCIPLE OF STRIVING ALWAYS TO MAKE THE BEST INDUCED HIM AT THE OUTSET TO STUDY METHODS OF PRODUCING THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF PRODUCT
THE EXCESS ACID POURED THROUGH AND ATE UP THE ACCOUNT-BOOKS
AND TO USE HIS OWN CRITICISM OF HIMSELF HE HAD TOO SANGUINE A TEMPERAMENT TO KEEP MONEY IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT WITH QUIET SELF-POSSESSION HE SEIZED HIS OPPORTUNITY BEGAN TO BUY MACHINERY RENTED A SHOP AND GOT WORK FOR IT
AFTER THE SHORT DISTASTEFUL PERIOD DURING THE INTRODUCTION OF HIS LIGHTING SYSTEM WHEN HE SPENT A LARGE PART OF HIS TIME AT THE OFFICES AT 65 FIFTH AVENUE NEW YORK OR ON THE ACTUAL WORK CONNECTED WITH THE NEW YORK EDISON INSTALLATION HE SETTLED BACK AGAIN IN MENLO PARK ALTOGETHER

THE COLLISION OF SHIPS IN FOGS CAN BE PREVENTED BY THIS CHARACTER OF SIGNALLING BY THE USE OF WHICH ALSO THE SAFETY OF A SHIP IN APPROACHING A DANGEROUS COAST IN FOGGY WEATHER CAN BE ASSURED
THE TRACK CURVED SHARPLY AT EITHER END ON A RADIUS OF FIFTY-SIX FEET AND THE LENGTH WAS ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF A MILE
MY AMBITION WAS ABOUT FOUR TIMES TOO LARGE FOR MY BUSINESS CAPACITY AND I KNEW THAT I WOULD SOON SPEND THIS MONEY EXPERIMENTING IF I GOT IT ALL AT ONCE SO I FIXED IT THAT I COULDN'T
THE LAST OF THESE ORIGINAL BUILDINGS NO
IF FOR EXAMPLE A SCENE OCCUPYING THIRTY SECONDS IS REPRODUCED IN TEN SECONDS THE MOVEMENTS WILL BE THREE TIMES AS FAST AND VICE VERSA
IT WAS NOT INDEED UNTIL A YEAR LATER IN MAY 1881 THAT THE FIRST REGULAR ROAD COLLECTING FARES WAS PUT IN OPERATION--A LITTLE STRETCH OF ONE AND A HALF MILES FROM BERLIN TO LICHTERFELDE WITH ONE MINIATURE MOTORCAR
AMERICAN YOUTHS TO-DAY ARE GIVEN IF OF A MECHANICAL TURN OF MIND TO AMATEUR TELEGRAPHY OR TELEPHONY BUT SELDOM IF EVER HAVE TO MAKE ANY PART OF THE SYSTEM CONSTRUCTED
COMMENT HAS BEEN MADE BY PERSONS OF ARTISTIC TASTE ON THE MONOTONY OF A CLUSTER OF HOUSES EXACTLY ALIKE IN APPEARANCE BUT THIS CRITICISM HAS BEEN ANTICIPATED AND THE MOLDS ARE SO MADE AS TO BE CAPABLE OF PERMUTATIONS OF ARRANGEMENT
IT MADE A REPORT LIKE A PISTOL AND WE ALL JUMPED UP STARTLED
IT WILL BE APPARENT THEREFORE THAT ANY MATERIAL WHICH PASSED IN BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE MIDDLE ROLLS AND THE MIDDLE AND BOTTOM ROLLS COULD BE GROUND AS FINE AS MIGHT BE DESIRED DEPENDING ENTIRELY UPON THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE APPLIED TO THE LOOSE ROLLS
IT WILL BE APPARENT THEREFORE THAT ANY MATERIAL WHICH PASSED IN BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE MIDDLE ROLLS AND THE MIDDLE AND BOTTOM ROLLS COULD BE GROUND AS FINE AS MIGHT BE DESIRED DEPENDING ENTIRELY UPON THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE APPLIED TO THE LOOSE ROLLS
THE DETAILS CIRCUMSTANCES AND TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ARE OF COURSE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE RELATING TO OTHER CLASSES OF INVENTIONS AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN NO CAUSE CELEBRE CONCERNING THE PHONOGRAPH AND MOTION-PICTURE PATENTS THE CONTENTION IS AS SHARP AND STRENUOUS AS IT WAS IN THE CASES RELATING TO ELECTRIC LIGHTING AND HEAVY CURRENT TECHNICS
THINGS WENT FAIRLY WELL FOR A TIME ON THAT MEMORABLE THURSDAY AFTERNOON WHEN ALL THE LABORATORY FORCE MADE HIGH HOLIDAY AND SCRAMBLED FOR FOOTHOLD ON THE LOCOMOTIVE FOR A TRIP
A VERY LARGE PROPORTION OF THE PRESIDENTS AND LEADING OFFICIALS OF THE GREAT RAILROAD SYSTEMS ARE OLD TELEGRAPHERS INCLUDING MESSRS
INTERESTING AS IT MIGHT BE TO FOLLOW AT LENGTH THE NUMEROUS PHASES OF INGENIOUS AND RESOURCEFUL DEVELOPMENT THAT TOOK PLACE DURING THOSE BUSY YEARS THE LIMIT OF PRESENT SPACE FORBIDS THEIR RELATION
THE LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED INTO EXISTENCE BY THE CONCENTRATING WORKS WAS OF THE MOST PRIMITIVE NATURE AND OFFERED NOTHING IN THE WAY OF FRIVOLITY OR AMUSEMENT
RELIEF WAS INSTANTANEOUS THE CORNER WAS BROKEN BUT THE HARM HAD BEEN DONE
THE MOTOR HAD ITS FIELD-MAGNET CIRCUIT IN PERMANENT CONNECTION AS A SHUNT ACROSS THE RAILS PROTECTED BY A CRUDE BARE COPPER-WIRE SAFETY-CATCH
THE BELT WAS RUNNING SO SMOOTHLY AND EVENLY THE POODLE DID NOT NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT AND THE FLOOR AND GOT INTO THE BELT BEFORE WE COULD DO ANYTHING
TO THOSE WHO HAVE PERHAPS GROWN WEARY OF SEEING EDISON'S NAME IN ARTICLES OF A SENSATIONAL CHARACTER IT MAY SOUND STRANGE TO SAY THAT AFTER ALL JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN DONE TO HIS VERSATILE AND MANY-SIDED NATURE
IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD OF COURSE THAT EVEN THESE FIGURES DO NOT REPRESENT THE FULL MEASURE OF ACTUAL INVENTION AS IN EVERY PROCESS AND AT EVERY STEP THERE WERE MANY DISCOVERIES THAT WERE NOT BROUGHT TO PATENT REGISTRATION BUT REMAINED TRADE SECRETS AND FURTHERMORE THAT IN PRACTICALLY EVERY CASE THE ACTUAL PATENTED INVENTION FOLLOWED FROM ONE TO A DOZEN OR MORE GRADUALLY DEVELOPING FORMS OF THE SAME IDEA
EDISON THEREFORE UNDERTOOK THE TASK OF DEVISING AN IMPROVED SYSTEM WHEREBY THE MESSAGE WHEN RECEIVED WOULD NOT REQUIRE TRANSLATION AND REWRITING BUT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY APPEAR ON THE TAPE IN PLAIN LETTERS AND WORDS READY FOR INSTANT DELIVERY
TOGETHER WE TOOK PRESS FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS MY COMPANION KEEPING THE APPARATUS IN ADJUSTMENT AND I COPYING
THE ACTION IS INCESSANT FOR IN ANY DRAMATIC REPRESENTATION INTENDED FOR THE MOTION-PICTURE FILM EVERY SECOND COUNTS
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR MAINTAINING THIS HIGH VACUUM WERE ONLY MADE POSSIBLE BY HIS INVENTION OF THE ONE-PIECE ALL-GLASS GLOBE IN WHICH ALL THE JOINTS WERE HERMETICALLY SEALED DURING ITS MANUFACTURE INTO A LAMP WHEREBY A HIGH VACUUM COULD BE RETAINED CONTINUOUSLY FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
BY CONNECTING ALL THESE SPRINGS IN CIRCUIT WITH A GALVANOMETER AND REVOLVING THE SHAFT RAPIDLY A NOTABLE DEFLECTION IS OBTAINED OF THE GALVANOMETER NEEDLE INDICATING THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY
THIS IS SIMPLY WONDERFUL AND A GOOD PROOF THAT THE CAUSE OF THE SPARK IS A TRUE UNKNOWN FORCE NOVEMBER 23 1815
INDEED THE HIGHEST RESULTS OBTAINABLE FROM THE BEST WERE 18 PER CENT
ONE DAY FRANK THOMSON THE PRESIDENT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD CAME OUT TO SEE THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY IN OPERATION
AND THE MOVABLE ROOF WAS OPENED SO THAT THE ACCENTUATING SUNLIGHT COULD STREAM IN UPON THE ACTOR WHOSE GESTICULATIONS WERE BEING CAUGHT BY THE CAMERA
THIS PROHIBITION MEANT LITTLE TO EDISON WHO HAD ACCESS TO NO OTHER INSTRUMENTS EXCEPT THOSE OF THE COMPANY
ABOUT AUGUST HE HAD OBTAINED A PUMP THAT WOULD PRODUCE A VACUUM UP TO ABOUT THE ONE-HUNDRED-THOUSANDTH PART OF AN ATMOSPHERE AND SOME TIME DURING THE NEXT MONTH OR BEGINNING OF OCTOBER HAD OBTAINED ONE THAT WOULD PRODUCE A VACUUM UP TO THE ONE-MILLIONTH PART OF AN ATMOSPHERE
FOOTNOTE 8
I TELL YOU GENIUS IS HARD WORK STICK-TO-IT-IVENESS AND COMMON SENSE YES SAID JOHNSON I ADMIT THERE IS ALL THAT TO IT BUT THERE'S STILL MORE
AT THE TIME I SELECTED TUNGSTATE OF CALCIUM BECAUSE IT WAS SO FLUORESCENT I SET FOUR MEN TO MAKING ALL KINDS OF CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS AND THUS COLLECTED UPWARD OF 8000 DIFFERENT CRYSTALS OF VARIOUS CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS DISCOVERING SEVERAL HUNDRED DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES WHICH WOULD FLUORESCE TO THE X-RAY
TO GLANCE AT AN INTERESTING CHILDHOOD AND A YOUTHFUL PERIOD MARKED BY A CAPACITY FOR DOING THINGS AND BY AN INSATIABLE THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE
WITH THE AID OF MESSRS
WHEN I CAME TO NEW YORK I PUT $30 INTO A SAVINGS-BANK UNDER THE NEW YORK SUN OFFICE
A RECEIVING DIAPHRAGM IS PLACED IN ANOTHER AND NEAR-BY CHAMBER WHICH IS PROVIDED WITH VERY SENSITIVE STETHOSCOPIC EAR-PIECES BY WHICH THE MORSE CHARACTERS SENT FROM ANOTHER VESSEL MAY BE RECEIVED
ITS VIBRATIONS WERE BROKEN BY MEANS OF A TELEGRAPH KEY INTO LONG AND SHORT PERIODS REPRESENTING MORSE CHARACTERS WHICH WERE TRANSMITTED INDUCTIVELY FROM THE TRAIN CIRCUIT TO THE POLE LINE OR VICE VERSA AND RECEIVED BY THE OPERATOR AT THE OTHER END THROUGH A HIGH-RESISTANCE TELEPHONE RECEIVER INSERTED IN THE SECONDARY CIRCUIT OF THE INDUCTION-COIL
THEN THERE CAME A THREAT OF LITIGATION FROM THE OWNERS OF THE BELL PATENT AND GOURAUD FOUND HE COULD NOT PUSH THE ENTERPRISE UNLESS HE COULD AVOID USING WHAT WAS ASSERTED TO BE AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE BELL RECEIVER
MR MCGOWAN FOUND IN THESE REGIONS A GREAT VARIETY OF BAMBOO SMALL AND LARGE SOME SPECIES GROWING SEVENTY-FIVE TO ONE HUNDRED FEET IN HEIGHT AND FROM SIX TO NINE INCHES IN DIAMETER
OF COURSE WHEN LIGHT IS RADIATED IN GREAT QUANTITIES NOT QUITE THESE TEMPERATURES WOULD BE REACHED
BEFORE EDISON'S INVENTION INCANDESCENT LAMPS HAD BEEN SUGGESTED AS A POSSIBILITY BUT THEY WERE PROVIDED WITH CARBON RODS OR STRIPS OF RELATIVELY LOW RESISTANCE AND TO BRING THESE TO INCANDESCENCE REQUIRED A CURRENT OF LOW PRESSURE BECAUSE A CURRENT OF HIGH VOLTAGE WOULD PASS THROUGH THEM SO READILY AS NOT TO GENERATE HEAT
HE HAS CONFRONTED MANY A SERIOUS PHYSICAL RISK AND COUNTS HIMSELF LUCKY TO HAVE COME THROUGH WITHOUT A SCRATCH OR SCAR
AT THIS POINT PLAUSIBLY COMES IN A SUGGESTION THAT THE INTERNAL PART OF THE CIRCUIT BE MADE VERY SMALL AND THE EXTERNAL PART VERY LARGE
THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE MACHINE AS A MECHANICAL STENOGRAPHER WHICH FIELD HAS BEEN TAKEN UP ACTIVELY ONLY WITHIN THE PAST FEW YEARS
THE FIRST TRIAL WAS HAD BEFORE JUDGE WALLACE IN THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND THE APPEAL WAS HEARD BY JUDGES LACOMBE AND SHIPMAN OF THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
WHAT I DID NOT KNOW AT THE TIME WAS THAT A COILED CABLE OWING TO INDUCTION WAS INFINITELY WORSE THAN WHEN LAID OUT STRAIGHT AND THAT MY SPEED WAS AS GOOD AS IF NOT BETTER THAN WITH THE REGULAR SYSTEM
THERE WERE THE LION-HUNTERS AND CELEBRITIES OF WHOM SARAH BERNHARDT MAY SERVE AS A TYPE
JAY GOULD AT THAT TIME CONTROLLED THE ATLANTIC PACIFIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY AND WAS COMPETING WITH THE WESTERN UNION AND ENDEAVORING TO DEPRESS WESTERN UNION STOCK ON THE EXCHANGE
13 1883 280,727 SYSTEM OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION
THIS WAS IN REALITY THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF RAILROAD TRAINS MOVED BY TELEGRAPH SIGNALS A PRACTICE NOW SO COMMON AND UNIVERSAL AS TO ATTRACT NO COMMENT
INCIDENTAL MENTION HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE OF THE LABORATORY AT EDISON'S WINTER RESIDENCE IN FLORIDA WHERE HE GOES ANNUALLY TO SPEND A MONTH OR SIX WEEKS
HE KNEW OF A YOUNG FELLOW WHO WAS DOING SOME GOOD WORK FOR MARSHALL LEFFERTS AND WHO IT WAS SAID WAS A GENIUS AT INVENTION AND A VERY FIEND FOR WORK
IMPROVEMENT MAKES STRANGE ROADS
IT HAS SIMPLY BEEN REFINED AND MADE MORE PERFECT IN A MECHANICAL SENSE
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THERE ARE TWO ELECTROMAGNETS ONE OF WHICH TM IS KNOWN AS THE TYPE-MAGNET AND THE OTHER PM AS THE PRESS-MAGNET THE FORMER HAVING TO DO WITH THE OPERATION OF THE TYPE-WHEELS AND THE LATTER WITH THE PRESSING OF THE PAPER TAPE AGAINST THEM
OCT 8 1891 476,532 ORE-SCREENING APPARATUS
AFTER BEING IN BOSTON SEVERAL MONTHS HE SAYS WORKING NEW YORK WIRE NO
AND FOR SOME YEARS THE PIONEERS HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY ESPECIALLY IN THIS COUNTRY IN RAISING MONEY FOR THEIR EARLY MODEST EXPERIMENTS
THE SYSTEM IS A COMBINATION OF TELEGRAPHIC APPARATUS AND TELEPHONE RECEIVER ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE THE LATTER INSTRUMENT IS NOT USED IN THE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD MANNER
IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD OF COURSE THAT THE ELECTROMOTOGRAPH IS A RECEIVING AND RELAYING INSTRUMENT
THE FEEDER AND THREE-WIRE SYSTEMS ARE AT THIS DAY USED IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD NOT ONLY IN CENTRAL-STATION WORK BUT IN THE INSTALLATION AND OPERATION OF ISOLATED ELECTRIC-LIGHT PLANTS IN LARGE BUILDINGS
HE ENCOUNTERED BOTH IN UNSTINTED MEASURE BUT KEPT ON GOING FORWARD UNTIL AFTER LONG TRAVEL HE HAD FOUND ALL THAT HE EXPECTED AND ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING MORE BESIDE
BOTH THE PRIMARY AND THE STORAGE BATTERY EMPLOY CERTAIN CHEMICAL PRODUCTS AS ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THEIR ELEMENTS AND INDEED OWE THEIR VERY EXISTENCE TO THE PECULIAR PREPARATION AND QUALITY OF SUCH PRODUCTS AS EXEMPLIFIED BY EDISON'S YEARS OF EXPERIMENTATION AND RESEARCH
THE VERTICAL BOUNDING WALLS ARE EDGES OF THE PERFORATED METAL CONTAINING TUBE
WE HAD NOT MUCH FRONTAGE
IV
IN FACT THE LABORATORY ON WHEELS SOON BECAME CROWDED WITH SUCH EQUIPMENT MOST COSTLY CHEMICALS WERE BOUGHT ON THE INSTALMENT PLAN AND FRESENIUS QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS SERVED AS A BASIS FOR CEASELESS TESTING AND STUDY
FROM FIRST TO LAST EDISON HAS BEEN AN EXPONENT AND ADVOCATE OF THE CENTRAL-STATION IDEA OF DISTRIBUTION NOW SO FAMILIAR TO THE PUBLIC MIND BUT STILL VERY FAR FROM BEING CARRIED OUT TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION
THIS CONTINUED UNTIL THE CROWD GOT SO SERIOUS THAT THE POLICEMAN HAD TO CLEAR IT OUT
STUDENTS FROM THE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WERE ALSO EAGER RECRUITS FOR HERE WAS SOMETHING THAT PROMISED A CAREER AND ONE THAT WAS ESPECIALLY ALLURING TO YOUTH BECAUSE OF ITS NOVELTY
AND IN THE EMERGENCY THE MEN NEAREST TO HIM AND MOST TRUSTED WERE THOSE UPON WHOM HE COULD BEST DEPEND FOR SUCH MISSIONARY WORK AS WAS NOW REQUIRED
I AT ONCE REPORTED TO MR EDISON WHOSE MANNER OF GREETING MY RETURN WAS AS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN AS HIS SUMMARY AND MATTER-OF-FACT MANNER OF MY DISPATCH
THIS WAS THE SEALING ON OF THE PART CARRYING THE FILAMENT INTO THE GLOBE WHICH WAS RATHER A DELICATE OPERATION IN THOSE DAYS AND REQUIRED SEVERAL MONTHS OF TRAINING BEFORE ANY ONE COULD SEAL IN A FAIR NUMBER OF PARTS IN A DAY
IT TOOK ONLY FIVE MINUTES FOR EDISON TO GET THE JOB FOR SUPERINTENDENT MILLIKEN A FINE TYPE OF TELEGRAPH OFFICIAL SAW QUICKLY THROUGH THE SUPERFICIALITIES AND REALIZED THAT IT WAS NO ORDINARY YOUNG OPERATOR HE WAS ENGAGING
THERE WAS A POINT WHERE IT WOULD NOT PAY TO RAISE IT AT ALL
APPARENTLY NOT A SINGLE STEP OF THAT KIND WAS UNDERTAKEN NOR PROBABLY WAS THERE A GAS MANAGER WHO WOULD HAVE AGREED WITH EDISON IN THE OPINION WRITTEN DOWN BY HIM AT THE TIME IN LITTLE NOTE-BOOK NO
AS MUCH AS $600 WAS TURNED OVER TO MRS EDISON IN ONE YEAR FROM THIS SOURCE
THE OLD ABSOLUTIST SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT WAS FAST BREAKING UP AND ANCIENT THRONES WERE TOTTERING
I GAVE A SUPPER TO SOME OF MY MEN TO CELEBRATE THIS ONLY TO BE TOLD TWO DAYS AFTERWARD THAT HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE AND THAT WE HAD LOST $500
HOURS PASSED BEFORE IT COULD BE FOUND
JUST WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS AS TO THE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT OF THE CORPORATION IT IS HARD TO DETERMINE A QUARTER OF A CENTURY LATER
THE ARROWS INDICATE THE FLOW OF CURRENT
JENKS WHO AS MANAGER OF THIS PLANT HERE MADE HIS DEBUT IN THE EDISON RANKS
THIS SOLVED THE DIFFICULTY
ONE OF THE COMPANIES STARTED WAS THE GERMAN EDISON NOW THE GREAT ALLGEMEINE ELEKTRICITAETS GESELLSCHAFT
IF THE LAMP EXTINGUISHED HAD BEEN ONE OF THOSE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE SYSTEM RESULTS OF A SIMILAR NATURE WOULD OBTAIN EXCEPT THAT THE CENTRAL CONDUCTOR WOULD FOR THE TIME BEING BECOME THE POSITIVE OF THAT SIDE AND THE EXCESS OF CURRENT WOULD FLOW THROUGH THE NEGATIVE N BACK TO THE SOURCE OF ENERGY
THIS PLACE WAS THE SCENE OF THE FURTHER EXPERIMENTS TO DEVELOP THE VARIOUS CHEMICAL FORMS OF NICKEL AND IRON AND TO DETERMINE BY TESTS WHAT WOULD BE BEST ADAPTED FOR USE IN CELLS MANUFACTURED ON A COMMERCIAL SCALE
THE ROPE SHOULD ALSO HAVE A COATING
AT THE END OF THE SECOND DAY THE ROACH WAS TAKEN OUT

FOUR INSTANCES OF PERSONAL DANGER MAY BE NOTED IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE
MY WIFE HAD ME WEAR THE LITTLE RED BUTTON BUT WHEN I SAW AMERICANS COMING I WOULD SLIP IT OUT OF MY LAPEL AS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD JOLLY ME FOR WEARING IT NOR WAS THIS ALL
AS SOON AS I LEARNED MY NEW TRADE WHICH I ACCOMPLISHED IN A FEW DAYS MR EDISON DIRECTED ME TO THE LIBRARY OF THE LABORATORY TO OCCUPY A FEW DAYS IN STUDYING THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE ORIENT AND PARTICULARLY IN DRAWING MAPS OF THE TRIBUTARIES OF THE GANGES THE IRRAWADDY AND THE BRAHMAPUTRA RIVERS AND OTHER REGIONS WHICH I EXPECTED TO EXPLORE
GENERALLY SPEAKING THIS CONSISTS OF A MOTOR-DRIVEN CYLINDER HAVING METALLIC PINS PLACED AT INTERVALS AND ARRANGED SPIRALLY AROUND ITS PERIPHERY
ALL THESE TESTS WERE VERY CLOSELY WATCHED BY EDISON WHO DEMANDED RIGOROUSLY THAT THE VARIOUS TRIALS OF THE BATTERY SHOULD BE CARRIED ON WITH ALL STRENUOUSNESS SO AS TO GET THE UTMOST RESULTS AND DEVELOP ANY POSSIBLE WEAKNESS
PHONOGRAPHIC BOOKS WHICH WILL SPEAK TO BLIND PEOPLE WITHOUT EFFORT ON THEIR PART
AND WHILE THE UPRIGHT STRUCTURE ON THE RIGHT IS INTENDED TO REPRESENT A SET OF MOLDS IN POSITION TO FORM A THREE-STORY HOUSE WITH CELLAR NO REGULAR DETAILS OF SUCH A BUILDING SUCH AS WINDOWS DOORS STAIRWAYS ETC ARE HERE SHOWN AS THEY WOULD ONLY TEND TO COMPLICATE AN EXPLANATION
THE ALIGNMENT OF THE LETTERS WAS AWFUL

THE ORIGINAL PHONOGRAPH AS BRIEFLY NOTED ABOVE WAS ROTATED BY HAND AND THE CYLINDER WAS FED SLOWLY LONGITUDINALLY BY MEANS OF A NUT ENGAGING A SCREW THREAD ON THE CYLINDER SHAFT

THE EDISON DYNAMO WITH ITS LARGE MASSES OF IRON WAS A VIVID CONTRAST TO THE THEN EXISTING TYPES WITH THEIR MEAGRE QUANTITIES OF THE FERRIC ELEMENT
AS THESE IRON MOLDS ARE NOT EPHEMERAL LIKE THE WOODEN FRAMING NOW USED IN CEMENT CONSTRUCTION BUT OF PRACTICALLY ILLIMITABLE LIFE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THEY CAN BE USED A GREAT NUMBER OF TIMES

HITCH YOUR WAGON TO A STAR SAID EMERSON
I HAVE RIDDEN AT FORTY MILES AN HOUR ON MR EDISON'S ELECTRIC RAILWAY--AND WE RAN OFF THE TRACK
AND THE EASY INVETERATE GOOD-NATURE OF EDISON TOWARD REPORTERS IS PROVERBIAL IN THE CRAFT
FOR FIVE YEARS HE HAD LIVED AND WORKED STEADILY AT EDISON LEAVING THERE ONLY ON SATURDAY NIGHT TO SPEND SUNDAY AT HIS HOME IN ORANGE AND RETURNING TO THE PLANT BY AN EARLY TRAIN ON MONDAY MORNING
WE WERE AT THE MACHINE WORKS GOERCK STREET

THERE IS A VARIETY OF TESTIMONY TO THE EFFECT THAT NOT ONLY MUSICAL SOUNDS BUT STRAY WORDS AND PHRASES WERE ACTUALLY TRANSMITTED WITH MEDIOCRE CASUAL SUCCESS
EDISON UNTIL WE FIND HIM KEEPING A HOTEL AT VIENNA MARRYING A SCHOOL-TEACHER THERE MISS NANCY ELLIOTT IN 1828 AND TAKING A LIVELY SHARE IN THE TROUBLOUS POLITICS OF THE TIME
THIS CHAPTER HAS RUN TO UNDUE LENGTH BUT IT MUST NOT CLOSE WITHOUT ONE CITATION FROM HIGH AUTHORITY AS TO THE SERVICE OF THE MILITARY TELEGRAPH CORPS SO OFTEN REFERRED TO IN IT
WHEREUPON THEY STRUCK AT A TIME THAT WAS CRITICAL
IT WAS NOT REALIZED UP TO SUCH A COMPARATIVELY RECENT DATE AS 1879 THAT THE SOLUTION OF THE GREAT PROBLEM OF SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT WOULD NOT HOWEVER BE FOUND MERELY IN THE PRODUCTION OF A DURABLE INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP--EVEN IF ANY OF THE LAMPS ABOVE REFERRED TO HAD FULFILLED THAT REQUIREMENT
DURING NOVEMBER 1883 A LITTLE OVER ONE YEAR AFTER THE STATION WAS STARTED BILLS FOR LIGHTING AMOUNTING TO OVER $9000 WERE COLLECTED
THIS WOULD INDEED OBVIATE THE TROUBLE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD GIVE RISE TO A MUCH MORE SERIOUS DIFFICULTY--NAMELY THE ENORMOUS OUTLAY FOR COPPER
WITHIN THE EXCHANGE THE FACE COULD EASILY BE SEEN HIGH UP ON THE WEST WALL OF THE ROOM AND THE MACHINE WAS OPERATED BY MR MERSEREAU THE OFFICIAL REGISTRAR OF THE GOLD BOARD
NO MATTER HOW LONG FIND IT HE CONTINUED
12 1880 263,132 ELECTRO MAGNETIC ROLLER
PAINTER OF WASHINGTON ABOUT ME IN THE FALL OF 1880
THE SLIM BARE COPPER WIRE SNAPPED ON THE LEAST PROVOCATION AND THE CIRCUIT WAS DOWN FOR THIRTY-SIX DAYS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS
THE RIGHTS WERE SECURED FOR THE PENINSULA
THIS SEEMED SO UNJUST THAT I DETERMINED TO GET OUT OF A PLACE THAT PERMITTED SUCH INJUSTICE FOR SEVERAL SUNDAYS HE WALKED THROUGH DIFFERENT PARTS OF NEW JERSEY WITH TWO OF HIS ASSISTANTS BEFORE HE DECIDED ON MENLO PARK
I RETURNED WITH THE ILLUSTRATED PAPERS AND MAGAZINES
THE FIELD-MAGNET HAD EIGHT SOLID CYLINDRICAL CORES 8 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND 57 INCHES LONG UPON EACH OF WHICH WAS WOUND AN EXCITING-COIL OF 3.2 OHMS RESISTANCE CONSISTING OF 2184 TURNS OF NO
SO I ASSUMED A RATHER LARGE LIBERAL AMOUNT OF IT TO PLAN MY STATION ON
THE INSTRUMENT IS SO SENSITIVE THAT WITH A DELICATE GALVANOMETER IT WILL SHOW THE IMPINGEMENT OF THE HEAT FROM A PERSON'S HAND THIRTY FEET AWAY
AT FIRST WE USED TO SHUT OUR EYES AND RUN THE HORSE PAST THIS GRAVEYARD AND IF THE HORSE STEPPED ON A TWIG MY HEART WOULD GIVE A VIOLENT MOVEMENT AND IT IS A WONDER THAT I HAVEN'T SOME VALVULAR DISEASE OF THAT ORGAN
THERE WAS A LOWER STATION NEAR THE JUNCTION WHERE THE DAY OPERATOR SLEPT
HE WANTED A LARGE EXTERNAL RESISTANCE AND A LOW INTERNAL ONE
SUPPOSE ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED TO EDISON
NEARLY ALL MY MEN WERE ON PIECE WORK AND I ALLOWED THEM TO MAKE GOOD WAGES AND NEVER CUT UNTIL THE PAY BECAME ABSURDLY HIGH AS THEY GOT MORE EXPERT
THE FAMILY RECORD'--A REGISTRY OF SAYINGS REMINISCENCES ETC BY MEMBERS OF A FAMILY IN THEIR OWN VOICES AND OF THE LAST WORDS OF DYING PERSONS
UPON SUCH OCCASIONS I HAD TO SUPPLY IN SOME CASES ONE-FIFTH OF THE WHOLE MATTER--PURE GUESSING--BUT I GOT CAUGHT ONLY ONCE

ENGINEERS TO WHOM EDISON COMMUNICATED HIS IDEAS WERE UNANIMOUS IN DECLARING THE THING AN IMPOSSIBILITY

THE EARLY WORK ON A METALLIC CONDUCTOR FOR LAMPS GAVE RISE TO SOME VERY THOROUGH RESEARCH ON MELTING AND ALLOYING METALS THE PREPARATION OF METALLIC OXIDES THE COATING OF FINE WIRES BY IMMERSING THEM IN A GREAT VARIETY OF CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS
IN HIS FIELD AS INVENTOR AND MAN OF SCIENCE HE STANDS AS CLEAR-CUT AND SECURE AS THE LIGHTHOUSE ON A ROCK AND AS INDIFFERENT TO THE TUMULT AROUND
FURTHER ON THE WRITER MR UPTON GIVES US ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS MODE OF REASONING WHEN EMBOLDENED AND SATISFIED WITH THE ABSURD THEORY ABOVE EXPOSED HE ENDEAVORS TO PROVE THE CAUSE OF THE INEFFICIENCY OF THE SIEMENS AND OTHER MACHINES
THIS SUDDEN STRAIN MIGHT HAVE TENDED TO STOP THE ENGINE DRIVING THE ROLLS
HE SOON DISCOVERED IT

I NOTICED THAT HE WORKED PRETTY NEAR THE WHOLE OF THE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
28 1906 964,221 SOUND RECORDS
IN THIS WARFARE THE POSSESSION OF A GOOD BATTERY TRANSMITTER COUNTED VERY HEAVILY IN FAVOR OF THE WESTERN UNION FOR UPON THAT THE REAL EXPANSION OF THE WHOLE INDUSTRY DEPENDED
THE WORLD WAS NOT SLOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT HENCE THERE ARE IN THE FIELD NUMEROUS OTHER CONCERNS IN THE SAME BUSINESS
THE NAMES OF YET OTHER ASSOCIATES OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME IN THIS NARRATIVE--"EDISON MEN WHO HAVE BEEN VERY PROUD OF THEIR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO THE INVENTOR AND HIS WORK AT OLD MENLO
SEVERAL OTHER IMPORTANT PATENTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO EDISON FOR CRUSHING AND GRINDING ROLLS SOME OF THEM BEING FOR ELABORATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS OF THOSE ABOVE DESCRIBED BUT ALL COVERING METHODS OF GREATER ECONOMY AND EFFECTIVENESS IN ROCK-GRINDING
THEIR THEORY AND PRACTICE WERE VERY IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD
THERE IS BUT ONE EDISON AND JOHNSON IS HIS PROPHET AS THE PLANT CONTINUED IN OPERATION VARIOUS DETAILS AND IDEAS OF IMPROVEMENT EMERGED AND MR HAMMER SAYS
HE SAID HE HADN'T
HE SAID HE WORE ONE OF SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT CALIBER WAS HONEST JOHN KRUESI WHO FIRST MADE HIS MARK AT MENLO PARK AND OF WHOM EDISON SAYS
CIPHER WHICH MEANT THAT THERE WAS A CIPHER MESSAGE FROM THE WAR DEPARTMENT AT WASHINGTON AND THAT IT WAS COMING--AND HE YELLED OUT LOUISVILLE I STARTED IMMEDIATELY TO CALL UP THAT PLACE
AT THE OUTSET THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF THE TELEPHONE WAS LITTLE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC AND BELL HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN SECURING CAPITAL
ON MANY OF THESE OCCASIONS THE LABORATORY WAS THE RENDEZVOUS OF JOLLY AND CONVIVIAL VISITORS MOSTLY OLD FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES OF MR EDISON
HE HAD RATHER A HARD ROW TO HOE
ONE OF THESE APPLICATIONS 23 EMBRACED AN INVENTION BY WHICH TWO MESSAGES COULD BE SENT NOT ONLY DUPLEX OR IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AS ABOVE EXPLAINED BUT COULD ALSO BE SENT DIPLEX"--THAT IS TO SAY IN ONE DIRECTION SIMULTANEOUSLY AS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT MESSAGES OVER THE ONE LINE
THIS INVENTION OF MR EDISON HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE LARGER CEMENT MANUFACTURERS AND THERE IS EVERY PROSPECT NOW THAT THE ENTIRE TRADE WILL TAKE LICENSES UNDER HIS KILN PATENTS WHEN HE DECIDED TO GO INTO THE CEMENT BUSINESS EDISON WAS THOROUGHLY AWAKE TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS PROPOSING TO BUTT INTO AN OLD-ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE PRINCIPAL MANUFACTURERS WERE CONCERNS OF LONG STANDING
THE CAPTAIN OF THEIR LARGEST BOAT HAD DIED SUDDENLY AND THEY WANTED A MESSAGE TAKEN TO ANOTHER CAPTAIN WHO LIVED ABOUT FOURTEEN MILES FROM RIDGEWAY STATION ON THE RAILROAD
I SAID TO SADLER
IT WAS ABOUT THREE MILES LONG OF NEARLY STANDARD GAUGE AND SUBSTANTIALLY CONSTRUCTED
HE WANTED TO MAKE A GIGANTIC GYROSCOPE WEIGHING SEVERAL TONS TO BE RUN BY AN ELECTRIC MOTOR AND PUT ON A SAILING SHIP
LETTER WRITING AND ALL KINDS OF DICTATION WITHOUT THE AID OF A STENOGRAPHER
OF COURSE THIS SYSTEM WAS INTENDED TO BE APPLIED IN EVERY PART OF A DISTRICT TO BE SUPPLIED WITH CURRENT SEPARATE SETS OF FEEDERS RUNNING OUT FROM THE STATION TO THE VARIOUS CENTRES
THERE WAS ALSO MR CHARLES L
HE TRIES EVERYTHING AND NEVER LETS UP EVEN THOUGH FAILURE IS APPARENTLY STARING HIM IN THE FACE
I GOT ORDERS TO DO SO AND ACTING UNDER THOSE ORDERS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT I BROKE IN AND TRIED TO SEND THE DESPATCH
AN INCREDIBLE QUANTITY OF LUMBER WAS MADE THERE YEARLY UNTIL THE FORESTS NEAR-BY VANISHED AND THE INDUSTRY WITH THEM
THE SECOND INCLUDES DEVICES LIKE THE TASIMETER PHONOMOTOR ODOROSCOPE ETC AND OTHERS NOW TO BE NOTED
BOTH WIRE AND BATTERIES WERE POOR AND ONE OF THE MEN DETAILED BY THE AUTHORITIES TO WATCH THE TEST REMARKED QUIETLY IN A FRIENDLY WAY
HE DID NOT KNOW THAT WE HAD ALREADY WORKED OUT THE SAFETY-FUSE AND THAT EVERY GROUP OF LIGHTS WAS THUS PROTECTED INDEPENDENTLY
NEITHER AS REGARDS THE LOSS DUE TO RESISTANCE NOR AS REGARDS THE NUMBER OF LAMPS PER HORSE-POWER IS THERE THE SLIGHTEST TROUBLE OR DISAPPOINTMENT ON THE PART OF OUR COMPANY AND YOUR CORRESPONDENT IS ENTIRELY IN ERROR IS ASSUMING THAT THERE IS
THE REAL GIST OF PATENT SUITS IS GENERALLY VERY SIMPLE AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT ANY JUDGE OF FAIR INTELLIGENCE ASSISTED BY ONE OR MORE SCIENTIFIC ADVISERS COULD IN A COUPLE OF DAYS AT THE MOST EXAMINE ALL THE NECESSARY WITNESSES
TRANSFERRED FROM THE PHONOGRAPH TO AN EDISON CARBON TRANSMITTER AND BY THAT DELIVERED TO THE EDISON MOTOGRAPH RECEIVER IN THE ENTHUSIASTIC LECTURE-HALL WHERE EVERY ONE COULD HEAR EACH SOUND AND SYLLABLE DISTINCTLY
I THINK PENDER WAS INTERESTED
ONE NIGHT HE ASKED ME IF I COULD TELL HIM HOW TO FIX A KEY SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BREAK EVEN IF THE CIRCUIT-BREAKER WAS OPEN AND ALSO SO THAT IT COULD NOT BE EASILY DETECTED
THEN THEY SENT TO REID MY DECORATION AND THEY TRIED TO PUT A SASH ON ME BUT I COULD NOT STAND FOR THAT
THE TRAIN WAS MADE UP OF THREE COACHES--BAGGAGE SMOKING AND ORDINARY PASSENGER OR LADIES THE BAGGAGE-CAR WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS--ONE FOR TRUNKS AND PACKAGES ONE FOR THE MAIL AND ONE FOR SMOKING
I HAVE A NEW CUSTOMER I SAID
EDISON AT SIXTY-THREE HAS A FINE PHYSIQUE AND BEING FREE FROM SERIOUS AILMENTS OF ANY KIND SHOULD CARRY ON THE TRADITIONS OF HIS LONG-LIVED ANCESTORS AS TO A VIGOROUS OLD AGE
EDISON SUBSEQUENTLY MADE STILL FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS DIRECTION BY WHICH HE REDUCED THE NUMBER OF CONDUCTING WIRES TO ONE BUT THE PRINCIPLES INVOLVED WERE ANALOGOUS TO THE ONE JUST DESCRIBED
A THOUSAND AND ONE INSTANCES COULD BE QUOTED IN ILLUSTRATION
BUT WHEN I GOT THE PRICE I FOUND THAT THEY WANTED $75,000 FOR ONE AND $80,000 FOR THE OTHER
BUT HIS ATTENTION WAS IN REALITY CONCENTRATED CLOSELY ON THE SUPPLY OF GREAT CENTRES OF POPULATION A TASK WHICH HE THEN FELT MIGHT WELL OCCUPY HIS LIFETIME
10 1899 643,764 REHEATING COMPRESSED AIR FOR INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES
AFTER HAVING FINISHED EVERYTHING TO HIS SATISFACTION HE LEFT
AFTER THE MONEY HAD BEEN IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS THE BANK BUSTED
HE HAS A SHARP EYE AND CAN PICK OUT OF THOUSANDS A SINGLE PLANT THAT HAS PROMISE OF WHAT HE WANTS

WORK AND INVENTION IN BOSTON VII
THE SITUATION WAS GALLING TO THE BUSY HIGH-SPIRITED YOUNG INVENTOR WHO MOREOVER HAD TO LIVE
AS A TELEGRAPH ENGINEER AND AS A LECTURER ON MINES AND EXPLOSIVES TO NAVAL CLASSES AT NEWPORT

HE WAS THE MASTER EXPERIMENTER
JUNE 15 1872 131,338 PRINTING TELEGRAPHS
I WAS MAKING SOME STUFF TO SQUIRT INTO FILAMENTS FOR THE INCANDESCENT LAMP
I SAW A CROWD AHEAD ON THE PLATFORM AND THOUGHT IT SOME EXCURSION BUT THE MOMENT I LANDED THERE WAS A RUSH FOR ME
FROM THE TABULATED RESULTS OF HUNDREDS OF TESTS THERE WERE SELECTED THREE THAT SHOWED THE BEST RESULTS
28 1891 471,268 ORE CONVEYOR AND METHOD OF ARRANGING ORE THEREON
AT THE PARTICULAR TIME THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED MRS EDISON AND HER FAMILY WERE AWAY FOR THE SUMMER AND I WAS STAYING AT THE GLENMONT HOME ON THE ORANGE MOUNTAINS
IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT THAT IMMERSED IN BUSINESS AND PREOCCUPIED WITH SCHEMES OF THIS CHARACTER MR EDISON WAS TO BLAME FOR THE NEGLECT OF HIS SON'S EDUCATION
THEN THE PARTY SEPARATED AT THE ANN STREET DOOR OF THE RESTAURANT AFTER MAKING PLANS TO SECURE THE NARRATIVE IN MORE DETAILED FORM FOR SUBSEQUENT USE--AND MCGOWAN HAS NOT BEEN SEEN FROM THAT HOUR TO THIS
EDISON ALSO IMPROVED THE ARMATURE BY DIVIDING IT AND THE COMMUTATOR INTO A FAR GREATER NUMBER OF SECTIONS THAN UP TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN THE PRACTICE
MR EDISON'S STORAGE BATTERY AND THE POURED CEMENT HOUSE HAVE NOT YET REACHED THE STAGE OF GREAT COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES AND THEREFORE HAVE NOT YET RISEN TO THE DIGNITY OF PATENT LITIGATION
THIS TOUR DE FORCE NEVER ATTEMPTED BEFORE WAS MERELY AN EXEMPLIFICATION OF THE VALUE OF THE PHONOGRAPH NOT ONLY IN ESTABLISHING AT FIRST HAND THE FACTS OF HISTORY BUT IN PRESERVING THE HUMAN VOICE
HE STARTED IN AND THE RESULTS WERE SURPRISING
PUTTING THE SUM AT $175,000 AND THE INTEREST AT 6 PER CENT
IT IS TRUE THAT EVEN DOWN TO THE PRESENT TIME THE FLAT RATE IS APPLIED TO A GREAT DEAL OF INCANDESCENT LIGHTING EACH LAMP BEING CHARGED FOR INDIVIDUALLY ACCORDING TO ITS PROBABLE CONSUMPTION DURING EACH MONTH
IT WILL HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED FROM THE FOREGOING CHAPTERS THAT FROM THE TIME OF BOYHOOD WHEN HE FIRST BEGAN TO RUB AGAINST THE WORLD HIS COMMERCIAL INSTINCTS WERE ALERT AND PREDOMINATED IN ALMOST ALL OF THE ENTERPRISES THAT HE SET IN MOTION

IF HOWEVER THE EXPERIENCE OF PAST YEARS IS ANY CRITERION THERE WILL PROBABLY COME A TIME IN THE FUTURE WHEN DESPITE PRESENT WIDELY EXPRESSED INCREDULITY AND CONTEMPTUOUS SNIFFS OF UNBELIEF IN THE PRACTICABILITY OF HIS IDEAS IN THESE DIRECTIONS ULTIMATE SUCCESS WILL GIVE RISE TO A SERIES OF HOTLY CONTESTED LEGAL CONFLICTS SUCH AS HAVE SIGNALIZED THE PRACTICAL OUTCOME OF HIS PAST EFFORTS IN OTHER LINES
LEAVING THE MAIN BUILDING WITH ITS CORPS OF BUSY EXPERIMENTERS AND COMING OUT INTO THE SPACIOUS YARD ONE NOTES THE FOUR LONG SINGLE-STORY BRICK STRUCTURES MENTIONED ABOVE
I ARRANGED THAT IF A STORM OCCURRED AND THE BAD SIDE GOT SHAKY THEY SHOULD DO THE BEST THEY COULD AND DRAW FREELY ON THEIR IMAGINATIONS
WHEN ALL IS READY THESE MOLDS WHICH ARE OF CAST IRON WITH SMOOTH INTERIOR SURFACES ARE TAKEN TO THE PLACE WHERE THE HOUSE IS TO BE ERECTED
2 1885 378,044 TELEPHONE TRANSMITTER
SO I GOT THE DIRECTORS TO PERMIT ME TO HIRE A MAN TO RUN THE STATION
IT WILL AFFORD A CLEARER IDEA OF THE EXTENT OF THE INDUSTRIES CLUSTERED IMMEDIATELY AROUND THE LABORATORY WHEN IT IS STATED THAT THE COMBINED FLOOR SPACE WHICH IS OCCUPIED BY THEM IN ALL THESE BUILDINGS IS EQUIVALENT IN THE AGGREGATE TO OVER FOURTEEN ACRES
THE PUBLIC WAS GRADUALLY EDUCATED TO A MORE CORRECT VIEW OF THE TRUE MERITS OF CONFLICTING CLAIMS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING THE BUSINESS HAS BEEN GREATLY UNIFIED AND BROUGHT WITHIN WELL-DEFINED AND CONTROLLABLE LINES
THEY WERE TOLD TO GO DOWN-STAIRS AND WAIT THE COMING OF THE MANAGER
I THEN PUT MEN ON IT I COULD TRUST AND MADE THE PRELIMINARY MACHINERY
EACH WHEEL OF THE LOCOMOTIVE WAS MADE WITH METALLIC RIM AND A CENTRE PORTION MADE OF WOOD OR PAPIER-MACHE
SUCH CIRCUITS NECESSARILY IMPLY THE EXISTENCE OF CENTRAL STATIONS WITH THEIR EQUIPMENT
THREE-HIGH ROLLS
NOTHING OF AN EVENTFUL NATURE OCCURRED DURING THIS TRIP BUT ON ARRIVAL AT IQUITOS THE TWO MEN SEPARATED
THE EXTENT OF PRODUCTION AND SALE OF SUPPLIES FOR THE MIMEOGRAPH MAY BE APPRECIATED WHEN IT IS STATED THAT THEY BRING ANNUALLY AN EQUIVALENT OF THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT REALIZED FROM SALES OF MACHINES
AND THE THIRD A BOX-CAR FAMILIARLY KNOWN AS THE PULLMAN THIS LATTER CAR HAD AN INTERESTING ADJUNCT IN AN ELECTRIC BRAKING SYSTEM COVERED BY EDISON'S PATENT NO
AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF STRENUOUS ACTIVITY IN THE EIGHTIES THE PHONOGRAPH AND ITS WAX RECORDS WERE DEVELOPED TO A SUFFICIENT DEGREE OF PERFECTION TO WARRANT HIM IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEIR MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCIAL INTRODUCTION
IT WAS MOUNTED ON A 6-INCH SHAFT
THE GOLD STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY WAS PROMPTLY ORGANIZED TO SUPPLY TO BROKERS THE SYSTEM WHICH WAS VERY RAPIDLY ADOPTED THROUGHOUT THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AT THE SOUTHERN TIP OF MANHATTAN ISLAND
APRIL 23 1873 150,846 TELEGRAPH RELAYS APRIL 23 1873 160,405 ADJUSTABLE ELECTRO MAGNETS FOR RELAYS ETC
SOON AFTER STARTING THE LARGE SHOP 10 AND 12 WARD STREET NEWARK I RENTED SHOP-ROOM TO THE INVENTOR OF A NEW RIFLE
BUT SUPPOSING IT INFUSIBLE THE FURTHER CONCENTRATION TO ONE-EIGHTH ITS SURFACE IT WOULD REACH A TEMPERATURE OF 16,000 DEGREES AND TO ONE-THIRTY-SECOND ITS SURFACE WHICH WOULD BE ABOUT THE RADIATING SURFACE OF THE ELECTRIC ARC IT WOULD REACH 64,000 DEGREES FAHR
IN THE SAME LIST WILL ALSO BE FOUND A LARGE NUMBER OF EDISON'S PATENTS ON APPARATUS AND METHODS OF SCREENING DRYING MIXING AND BRIQUETTING AS WELL AS FOR DUST-PROOF BEARINGS AND VARIOUS TYPES AND GROUPINGS OF SEPARATORS ALL OF WHICH WERE CALLED FORTH BY THE EXIGENCIES AND MAGNITUDE OF HIS GREAT UNDERTAKING AND WITHOUT WHICH HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE ATTAINED THE SUCCESSFUL PHYSICAL RESULTS THAT CROWNED HIS LABORS
TO THIS CLAIM IF IT BE SERIOUSLY ENTERTAINED THE OBVIOUS REPLY IS THAT THOUSANDS OF PERSONS PROBABLY HAD SEEN THIS SPARK BEFORE IT WAS DISCOVERED BY MR EDISON
THE PRINCIPAL PART OF THE OUTFIT WAS THE ELECTRIC MOTOR
R

THE RAILROAD SYSTEM OF OHIO WAS STILL IN THE FUTURE BUT THE WESTERN RESERVE HAD ALREADY BECOME A VAST WHEAT-FIELD AND HUGE QUANTITIES OF GRAIN FROM THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN COUNTIES SOUGHT SHIPMENT TO EASTERN PORTS
THE EXCITEMENT WAS PRODIGIOUS
MR SPRAGUE COMPARED THE RELATIONS THUS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN ELECTRICITY AND THE HIGH-SPEED ENGINE NOT TO THOSE OF DEBTOR AND CREDITOR BUT RATHER TO THOSE OF PARTNERS--AN INDUSTRIAL MARRIAGE--ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THE ENGINEERING WORLD

CHARLIE STARTED IN AND IN A BEAUTIFUL LARGE ROUND HAND COPIED THAT MESSAGE
AND THESE WIRES IN ALL CONDITIONS OF SAG OR DECAY RAMIFIED AND CRISSCROSSED IN EVERY DIRECTION OFTEN HANGING BROKEN AND LOOSE-ENDED FOR MONTHS THERE BEING NO OFFICIAL COMPULSION TO REMOVE ANY DEAD WIRE
NEED I ADD THAT THEY WERE CONTEMPTUOUSLY WONDERED AT BY THIS SAME BRITISH WORKMAN AS A PARCEL OF OUTLANDISH ADULT BOYS WHO SWEATED THEMSELVES FOR THEIR EMPLOYER'S BENEFIT INSTEAD OF LOOKING AFTER THEIR OWN INTEREST
AND NOW BEING ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE SERIES OF EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS THAT LED UP TO THE BASIC INVENTION WE INTERPOLATE A BRIEF EXPLANATION IN ORDER THAT THE READER MAY COMPREHEND THE LOGICAL REASONING AND WORK THAT IN THIS CASE PRODUCED SUCH FAR-REACHING RESULTS
SOCIALLY THE EDISON FAMILY STOOD HIGH IN PORT HURON AT A TIME WHEN THERE WAS RELATIVELY MORE WEALTH AND GENERAL ACTIVITY THAN TO-DAY
THE LOCOMOTIVE NAMED THE JUDGE AFTER JUSTICE FIELD AN UNCLE OF STEPHEN D
THIS BOOK IS THEN PASSED ON TO THAT MEMBER OF THE EXPERIMENTAL STAFF WHOSE SPECIAL TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE ARE BEST ADAPTED TO THE WORK
AN OPERATOR ON THE SARNIA SHORE WAS QUICK ENOUGH TO CATCH THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STRANGE WHISTLING AND MESSAGES WERE THUS SENT IN WIRELESS FASHION ACROSS THE ICE-FLOES IN THE RIVER
NO JAR BREAKAGE
A MOVEMENT OF THE NEEDLE IN ONE DIRECTION DENOTING EXPANSION AND IN THE OTHER CONTRACTION
IT WAS NOT SUFFICIENT HOWEVER TO DISCOURAGE HIM AND HE IMMEDIATELY TRIED AGAIN AND HE CONTINUED TO TRY FOR THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR
EDISON AT ONCE SUGGESTED USING THE STEAM WHISTLE OF THE LOCOMOTIVE AND BY MANIPULATING THE VALVE CONVERSED THE SHORT AND LONG OUTBURSTS OF SHRILL SOUND INTO THE MORSE CODE
IF HE MADE MORE THAN THE WAGES HE KEPT IT
THROUGHOUT THE EDISON STAFF THERE WAS A MINGLED FEELING OF PRIDE IN THE WORK RESENTMENT AT THE DOUBTS EXPRESSED ABOUT IT AND KEEN DESIRE TO SHOW HOW EXCELLENT IT WAS
I EXPECT IT TO BE FOUND IN THE PALM OR BAMBOO FAMILY
BUT THE MEN HAVING GOT A LITTLE MORE WAGES THOUGHT THEY WOULD TRY COERCION AND GET A LITTLE MORE AS WE WERE CONSIDERED SOFT MARKS
IT IS OF MUCH INTEREST HOWEVER TO REMEMBER THE FACT THAT IT WAS BY REASON OF HIS NOTABLE WORK IN CONNECTION WITH THIS DEVICE THAT HE FIRST BECAME KNOWN AS AN INVENTOR
THUS A COMPLETE SEPARATION IS EFFECTED
AN ADDITIONAL LOSS OF EFFICIENCY AROSE FROM THE FACT THAT THE MATERIAL MOVED SO RAPIDLY TOWARD THE COMBUSTION ZONE THAT IT HAD NOT GIVEN UP ALL ITS CARBON DIOXIDE ON REACHING THERE
AT MENLO PARK NO EFFORT WAS MADE FOR PERMANENCY
BUT I KEPT MOSTLY IN THE SMOKING-ROOM
WHILE EACH SET CONSTITUTES VIRTUALLY A SEPARATE STAGE THEY ARE ALL ON THE SAME FLOOR WITHOUT WINGS OR PROSCENIUM-ARCHES AND SEPARATED ONLY BY A FEW FEET
NO LOSS OF ACTIVE MATERIAL HENCE NO SEDIMENT SHORT-CIRCUITS

MR J
ACCEPT MY CONGRATULATIONS
THIS ARRANGEMENT TENDS TO OBVIATE ANY MISLEADING DEFLECTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE THROUGH CHANGES IN THE BATTERY
HE REALIZED THIS FULLY BUT HE ALSO KNEW THAT TO GO ON WOULD SIMPLY BE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DEFECTIVE BATTERIES IN CIRCULATION WHICH WOULD ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A PERMANENT CLOSURE AND REAL FAILURE
EDISON THOUGHT HIS RESISTANCE-BOXES AN EQUALLY SUPERFLUOUS DISPLAY AND THEREFORE INGENIOUSLY WOUND SOME COPPER RESISTANCE WIRE AROUND ONE OF THE LEGS OF THE MOTOR FIELD MAGNET WHERE IT WAS OUT OF THE WAY SERVED AS A USEFUL EXTRA FIELD COIL IN STARTING UP THE MOTOR AND DISMISSED MOST OF THE BOXES BACK TO THE LABORATORY--A FEW BEING RETAINED UNDER THE SEAT FOR CHANCE EMERGENCIES
WHAT KIND OF COPY DOES HE MAKE WAS THE CAUTIOUS RESPONSE
THESEUS OR SIEGFRIED OR ANY KNIGHT OF THE FAIRY BOOKS MIGHT ENVY THE VICTORIES OF EDISON'S IRRESISTIBLE LIEUTENANT
AND THAT AT MENLO PARK HE LAID OUT AND OPERATED SUCH A SYSTEM WITH ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE LAMPS
5 WHICH SHOWS A FRONT ELEVATION WITH THE CASINGS HOPPER ETC REMOVED AND ALSO SHOWS ABOVE THE ROLLS THE ROPE AND PULLEYS THE SUPPORTS FOR WHICH ARE ALSO REMOVED FOR THE SAKE OF CLEARNESS IN THE ILLUSTRATION
IS IT GENERALLY REALIZED THAT NO MATTER HOW FLAGRANT THE INFRINGEMENT NOR HOW BAREFACED AND IMPUDENT THE INFRINGER NO FEDERAL COURT WILL GRANT AN INJUNCTION UNTIL THE PATENT SHALL HAVE BEEN FIRST LITIGATED TO FINAL HEARING AND SUSTAINED
GRIM AND UNCOMPROMISING AS THE DESCRIPTION READS IT WAS TYPICAL OF THE EQUIPMENT IN THOSE REMOTE DAYS OF THE TELEGRAPH AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR
A LARGE NUMBER OF THE WORDS AND PHRASES IN MODERN ELECTRICAL PARLANCE OWE THEIR ORIGIN TO HIM
FOUR YEARS LATER THE MEMORABLE MESSAGE WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT WAS SENT BY YOUNG MISS ELLSWORTH OVER HIS CIRCUITS AND INCREDULOUS WASHINGTON WAS ADVISED BY WIRE OF THE ACTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN BALTIMORE IN NOMINATING POLK
FROM THAT DAY TO THIS THE EDISON CAMERA HAS BEEN THE ACCEPTED STANDARD FOR SECURING PICTURES OF OBJECTS IN MOTION AND SUCH CHANGES AS HAVE BEEN MADE IN IT HAVE BEEN PURELY IN THE NATURE OF DETAIL MECHANICAL REFINEMENTS
EDISON'S ATTITUDE TOWARD IT EVEN AS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENT TO HIS LIGHTING SYSTEM WAS ALWAYS ONE OF SCEPTICISM AND HE REMARKED CONTEMPTUOUSLY THAT THE BEST STORAGE BATTERY HE KNEW WAS A TON OF COAL
EDISON WHO WAS ALWAYS READY TO EARN SOME EXTRA MONEY FOR HIS EXPERIMENTS AND WAS ALREADY KNOWN AS THE BEST-INFORMED OPERATOR IN THE OFFICE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
ANOTHER SPECIAL INSTRUMENT IS A DEAD BEAT GALVANOMETER WHICH DIFFERS FROM THE ORDINARY FORM OF GALVANOMETER IN HAVING NO COILS OR MAGNETIC NEEDLE
ONE DAY HOWEVER AS WE DROVE OVER A MOUNTAIN RANGE NOT KNOWN AS IRON-BEARING LAND I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT THE NEEDLE WAS STRONGLY ATTRACTED AND REMAINED SO
NATURALLY IMPATIENT AT ANY DELAY WHICH INTERPOSED IN HIS INSISTENT AND SEARCHING METHODS AND REALIZING THE NECESSITY OF MAINTAINING THE INSPIRATION ATTENDING HIS WORK AT ANY TIME HE DETERMINED TO HAVE WITHIN HIS IMMEDIATE REACH THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE WORLD
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST SERIOUS DRAWBACK LAY IN THE HIGH-RESISTANCE ARMATURE BASED UPON THE HIGHEST SCIENTIFIC DICTUM OF THE TIME THAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF WORK FROM A MACHINE THE INTERNAL RESISTANCE OF THE ARMATURE MUST EQUAL THE RESISTANCE OF THE EXTERIOR CIRCUIT ALTHOUGH THE APPLICATION OF THIS PRINCIPLE ENTAILED THE USELESS EXPENDITURE OF AT LEAST 50 PER CENT
BUT THE THIRD NIGHT THEY WERE WATCHING AND CAUGHT THE LITTLE DUTCH BOY TOOK HIM TO THE LOCK-UP AT THE FORT AND SHUT HIM UP
THIS ACTION OF THE POLE-CHANGER IS EFFECTED BY MOVEMENTS OF THE ARMATURE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET THROUGH THE MANIPULATION OF AN ORDINARY TELEGRAPH KEY BY AN OPERATOR AT THE HOME STATION AS IN THE OPERATION OF THE TRANSMITTER ABOVE REFERRED TO

FOR PURPOSES OF ECONOMY IN INVESTMENT AND MAINTENANCE EDISON DEVISED SUBSEQUENTLY A PLAN BY WHICH THE NUMBER OF CONDUCTING LINES WAS REDUCED TO TWO INSTEAD OF FIVE
THEY APPEARED TO BE INTERESTED AND I PROCEEDED TO ENTER UPON A COMPARISON OF COAL MADE INTO GAS OR BURNED UNDER A BOILER TO BE CONVERTED INTO ELECTRICITY
IN A SUIT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ELECTRIC LIGHTING COMPANY UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK JULY 14 1891 JUDGE WALLACE SAID IN HIS OPINION
WHEN WE STARTED THE STATION AT PEARL STREET IN SEPTEMBER 1882 WE WERE NOT VERY COMMERCIAL
THE OLD HOUSE IN WHICH EDISON WAS BORN IS STILL OCCUPIED IN 1910 BY MR S
MEANTIME THE TELEPHONIC ART IN AMERICA WAS UNDERGOING VERY RAPID DEVELOPMENT
IN THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES WHEN THE COUNTRY IS SETTLED AND COMMERCIALISM IS DIMINISHED THERE WILL BE TIME FOR THE LITERARY MEN
HENCE ASSUMING THAT THE RELAY IS TO BE ACTUATED FROM THE DISTANT END D IT IS IN A SENSE IMMATERIAL WHETHER THE BATTERIES CONNECTED WITH WIRE A ASSIST OR OPPOSE EACH OTHER AS IN EITHER CASE THE BAR WOULD BE MAGNETIZED ONLY THROUGH THE OPERATION OF THE DISTANT KEY
PERHAPS THE
3 HAS A DOUBLE MISSION--THE FARTHER HALF BEING PARTITIONED OFF FOR A PATTERN-MAKING SHOP WHILE THE OTHER HALF IS USED AS A STORE-ROOM FOR CHEMICALS IN QUANTITY AND FOR CHEMICAL APPARATUS AND UTENSILS
OF COURSE I VISITED THE LOUVRE AND SAW THE OLD MASTERS WHICH I COULD NOT ENJOY
CONTRARY TO THE GENERAL NOTION VERY FEW OF THE GREAT MODERN INVENTIONS HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF A SUDDEN INSPIRATION BY WHICH MINERVA-LIKE THEY HAVE SPRUNG FULL-FLEDGED FROM THEIR CREATORS BRAIN
IT IS FAIR TO OFFER TRIBUTE HERE TO HER BRAVERY AS WELL AS TO HER WISDOM FOR AT TIMES SHE WAS IN MORTAL TERROR LEST THE PRECOCIOUS EXPERIMENTER BELOW SHOULD IN HIS INEXPERIENCE MAKE SOME AWFUL COMBINATION THAT WOULD EXPLODE AND BRING DOWN THE HOUSE IN RUINS ON HIMSELF AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY
THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT TOOK ENTIRE CHARGE OF THE INSTALLATION OF THE PLANT AND THE FORMAL OPENING WAS ATTENDED ON OCTOBER 1 1883 BY MR EDISON WHO THEN REMAINED A WEEK IN CEASELESS STUDY AND CONSULTATION OVER THE CONDITIONS DEVELOPED BY THIS INITIAL THREE-WIRE UNDERGROUND PLANT
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PROBLEM IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THIS QUESTION OF HIGH SPEED WAS APPARENTLY REGARDED BY ALL EDISON'S PREDECESSORS AS THE CRUCIAL POINT
NOTE HAS BEEN MADE OF THE PRESENCE OF ELLSWORTH IN THE CINCINNATI OFFICE AND HIS SERVICE WITH THE CONFEDERATE GUERRILLA MORGAN FOR WHOM HE TAPPED FEDERAL WIRES READ MILITARY MESSAGES SENT FALSE ONES AND DID SERIOUS MISCHIEF GENERALLY
ONE PARTICULAR SET OF EXPERIMENTS RELATING TO SUCH WORK WAS MADE ON BEHALF OF VISITORS FROM SOUTH AMERICA AND WERE DOUBTLESS THE FIRST TESTS OF THE KIND MADE FOR THAT CONTINENT WHERE NOW MANY FINE ELECTRIC STREET AND INTERURBAN RAILWAY SYSTEMS ARE IN OPERATION
THIS WAS PROBABLY A UNIQUE ACHIEVEMENT IN ITSELF AMONG RAILWAY OPERATORS OF THAT DAY OR OF LATER TIMES
FOR FILIBUSTERING PURPOSES HOWEVER THE PRESENT METHODS ARE MOST ADMIRABLE EDISON DETERMINED FROM THAT TIME FORTH TO DEVOTE HIS INVENTIVE FACULTIES ONLY TO THINGS FOR WHICH THERE WAS A REAL GENUINE DEMAND SOMETHING THAT SUBSERVED THE ACTUAL NECESSITIES OF HUMANITY
3 THEY WILL TEND TO PRODUCE EXACTLY OPPOSITE POLARITIES AND THUS NEUTRALIZE EACH OTHER
1 THE INITIAL VOLTAGE WOULD HAVE TO BE SO HIGH IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE PROPER CANDLE-POWER AT THE END OF THE CIRCUIT THAT THE LAMPS NEAREST THE GENERATOR WOULD BE DANGEROUSLY OVERHEATED
IN APPEARANCE IT IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT
IT IS TRUE THAT THE MODERN ELECTRICAL ARTS HAVE BEEN A GREAT STIMULATOR OF COPPER PRODUCTION NOW TAKING A QUARTER OF ALL MADE
BETWEEN NEW YORK AND BOSTON TWO THOUSAND WORDS A MINUTE HAVE BEEN SENT
MAY 21 1881 263,137 ELECTRIC CHANDELIER
HE CONFIRMED MY VIEWS OF THE AUTOMATIC SYSTEM
THUS FROM THE LITTLE CELLAR AT PORT HURON FROM THE SCANT SHELVES IN A BAGGAGE CAR FROM THE NOOKS AND CORNERS OF DINGY TELEGRAPH OFFICES AND THE GRIMY LITTLE SHOPS IN NEW YORK AND NEWARK HE HAD NOW COME TO THE PROUD OWNERSHIP OF AN ESTABLISHMENT TO WHICH HIS FAVORITE WORD LABORATORY MIGHT JUSTLY BE APPLIED
HE PRODUCED THE FIRST PRACTICAL INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP
WHILE THE PHILOSOPHY OF POURING OR CASTING A COMPLETE HOUSE IN ITS ENTIRETY IS APPARENTLY QUITE SIMPLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENGINEERING AND MECHANICAL QUESTIONS INVOLVES THE SOLUTION OF A VAST NUMBER OF MOST INTRICATE AND COMPLICATED PROBLEMS COVERING NOT ONLY THE BUILDING AS A WHOLE BUT ITS NUMEROUS PARTS DOWN TO THE MINUTEST DETAIL
THE NEXT DAY HE WAS TOLD OFF TO LIFT A CERTAIN PIECE AND IF THE MAN COULD NOT LIFT IT HE WAS DISCHARGED
UPTON WHO WAS EARLY EMPLOYED BY MR EDISON AS HIS MATHEMATICIAN FURNISHES A PLEASANT VIVID PICTURE OF HIS CHIEF ASSOCIATES ENGAGED ON THE MEMORABLE WORK AT MENLO PARK
THE HEIGHT OF THIS INVENTIVE ACTIVITY WAS ATTAINED ABOUT 1882 IN WHICH YEAR NO FEWER THAN 141 PATENTS WERE APPLIED FOR AND SEVENTY-FIVE GRANTED TO HIM OR NEARLY NINE TIMES AS MANY AS IN 1876 WHEN INVENTION AS A PROFESSION MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY THIS PROLIFIC GENIUS
IN THIS BRIEF OUTLINE REVIEW OF THE FLOURISHING AND EXTENSIVE COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES CENTRED AROUND THE ORANGE LABORATORY THE FACTS IT IS BELIEVED CONTAIN A COMPLETE REFUTATION OF THE IDEA THAT AN INVENTOR CANNOT BE A BUSINESS MAN
AS BEFORE EDISON WAS ALLOTTED TO PRESS REPORT AND REMEMBERS VERY DISTINCTLY TAKING THE PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE AND VETO OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BILL BY PRESIDENT JOHNSON
MANY IRRESPONSIBLE AND PURELY PIRATICAL CONCERNS WERE CLOSED ALTOGETHER
IN PRACTICE THIS BUZZER WAS CONTINUOUSLY OPERATED AT HIGH SPEED BY A BATTERY
THEN BECAUSE HE WAS DISSATISFIED WITH IT HE STOPPED THE SALES AND COMMENCED A NEW LINE OF INVESTIGATION WHICH HAS RECENTLY CULMINATED SUCCESSFULLY
TABLES AND FORMULAE
HE RENTED A ROOM IN THE TOP FLOOR OF AN OFFICE BUILDING BOUGHT A COT AND AN OIL-STOVE A FOOT LATHE AND SOME TOOLS
THE FAULT RESTS IN MY JUDGMENT ALMOST WHOLLY WITH THE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH TESTIMONY TO THE EXTENT OF THOUSANDS OF PAGES BEARING ON ALL CONCEIVABLE SUBJECTS MANY OF THEM HAVING NO POSSIBLE CONNECTION WITH THE INVENTION IN DISPUTE IS PRESENTED TO AN OVER-WORKED JUDGE IN AN HOUR OR TWO OF ARGUMENT SUPPORTED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES OF BRIEFS

SPRAGUE SAYS IN AN ARTICLE IN THE CENTURY MAGAZINE OF JULY 1905 ON THE CREATION OF THE NEW ART
I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE COLD
A PERSON TALKING INTO THE CARBON TRANSMITTER IN NEW YORK HAD HIS VOICE SO AMPLIFIED THAT HE COULD BE HEARD ONE THOUSAND FEET AWAY IN AN OPEN FIELD AT MENLO PARK
WITH EDISON IN THIS INTRODUCTION OF HIS LIGHTING SYSTEM THE METHOD WAS RUTHLESS BUT NOT RECKLESS
THE ADVANCE IN THE ART WAS DUE TO THE CARBON ELECTRODE OF EDISON
IT IS NATURAL THEREFORE AFTER HIS INTERVENING WORK ON INDICATORS STOCK TICKERS AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHS AND TYPEWRITERS TO FIND HIM HARKING BACK TO DUPLEX TELEGRAPHY IF INDEED HE CAN BE SAID TO HAVE DROPPED IT IN THE INTERVAL
DICKSON JAN
EDISON HIMSELF SAYS
JUNE 3 1891 475,493 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE
AND THEY DIDN'T RELISH IT AT ALL
HE REASONED THAT THE ADVANTAGES THUS OBTAINED WOULD BE FOURFOLD
A VERY REAL DIFFICULTY IN THE INTRODUCTION OF HIS LAMP AND LIGHTING SYSTEM BY EDISON LAY IN THE ABSOLUTE IGNORANCE OF THE PUBLIC AT LARGE NOT ONLY AS TO ITS MERITS BUT AS TO THE VERY APPEARANCE OF THE LIGHT SOME FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD GONE OUT TO MENLO PARK AND HAD THERE SEEN THE LAMPS IN OPERATION AT THE LABORATORY OR ON THE HILLSIDES BUT THEY WERE AN INSIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE UNITED STATES
EDISON FINALLY DECIDED TO APPLY A PRELIMINARY METALLIC COATING OF INFINITESIMAL THINNESS AND ACCOMPLISHED THIS OBJECT BY A REMARKABLE PROCESS KNOWN AS THE VACUOUS DEPOSIT
GREAT ATTENTION WAS ALSO PAID TO ALL THE JOINTS WHICH WERE SMOOTHED DOWN SO AS TO MAKE A PERFECT MAGNETIC CONTACT
JEHL HIPPLE AND FORCE ASSISTED MR BATCHELOR TO INSTALL THE LAMP-WORKS OF THE FRENCH EDISON COMPANY AT IVRY-SUR-SEINE
HE WAS ALSO NATURALLY IN A POSITION TO ASSUME THE TASK HE SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH OF UNDERTAKING TO PLAN AND-BUILD AN IMPROVED TYPE OF MACHINE THAT SHOULD BE COMMERCIAL IN HAVING AN EFFICIENCY OF AT LEAST 90 PER CENT
ALL HAD THE COMPLEXION OF CADAVERS
HOW FAR IS IT FROM HERE TO LAWRENCE
THE OPERATOR PUTS THE RECEIVER TO HIS EAR AND LISTENS FOR THE MESSAGE WHICH THE TELEPHONE RENDERS AUDIBLE IN THE MORSE CHARACTERS
BUT EDISON WAS BACK IN HIS LABORATORY AND HARD AT WORK BEFORE THE END OF AUGUST GATHERING UP MANY LOOSE ENDS AND TRYING OUT MANY THOUGHTS AND IDEAS THAT HAD ACCUMULATED ON THE TRIP
IT IS EQUALLY TRUE THAT IN EDISON AND THE MANY MEN WHO HAVE GRADUATED FROM HIS STERN SCHOOL OF ENDEAVOR AMERICA HAS HAD ITS FOREMOST SEAT OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
I HAD VERY LITTLE FAITH IN HIS ABILITY TO GET ANY BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE HIM A CHANCE AS HE FELT CERTAIN OF HIS ABILITY TO SUCCEED
AN EVIDENCE OF THE ACTIVITY IN THIS DIRECTION IS FURNISHED BY THE FACT THAT SIX REVENUE CUTTERS WERE LAUNCHED AT THIS PORT IN THESE BRISK DAYS OF ITS PRIME
PINS 1-2 AND 3-4 ARE ELECTRICALLY CONNECTED TOGETHER IN OTHER PAIRS AND THEN EACH OF THESE PAIRS IS CONNECTED WITH ONE OF THE MAIN LINES THAT RUN RESPECTIVELY TO THE MIDDLE OF TWO GROUPS OF BATTERIES AT THE TRANSMITTING END
EDISON DROPPED HIS PAPERS AND HIS GLAZED CAP AND MADE A DASH FOR THE CHILD WHOM HE PICKED UP AND LIFTED TO SAFETY WITHOUT A SECOND TO SPARE AS THE WHEEL OF THE CAR STRUCK HIS HEEL
A DIAGRAMMATIC SKETCH OF THIS REMARKABLE MACHINE IS SHOWN IN FIG
THESE ACTIVE ELEMENTS ARE NOT PUT IN THE PLATES AS METALS
HE HAD FORESEEN THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR SPECIAL DEVICES TO PREVENT FIRES FROM OCCURRING BY REASON OF ANY EXCESS OF CURRENT FLOWING IN ANY CIRCUIT
MENLO PARK HAS HITHERTO BEEN ASSOCIATED IN THE PUBLIC THOUGHT WITH THE TELEPHONE PHONOGRAPH AND INCANDESCENT LAMP
IF HE WANTED PERSONALLY TO SEND A COMMUNICATION TO ANYBODY IF IT WAS ONE OF HIS CLOSE ASSOCIATES IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A PENCIL MEMORANDUM SIGNED EDISON I WAS A SHORTHAND WRITER BUT SELDOM TOOK DOWN FROM EDISON'S DICTATION UNLESS IT WAS ON SOME TECHNICAL SUBJECT THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND
AT SEVENTY FIVE I EXPECT TO WEAR LOUD WAISTCOATS WITH FANCY BUTTONS
THIS RELEASES THE LAYERS OF NICKEL SO THAT EACH OF THESE SMALL SQUARES BECOMES ONE HUNDRED TINY SHEETS OR FLAKES OF PURE METALLIC NICKEL SO THIN THAT WHEN THEY ARE DRIED THEY WILL FLOAT IN THE AIR LIKE THISTLE-DOWN
THE CONVERSATIONS WITH EDISON THAT ELICITED THESE STORIES BROUGHT OUT SOME DETAILS AS TO PERIL THAT ATTENDS EXPERIMENTATION
MARIE MR C
THUS MATTERS CONTINUED UNTIL AT ABOUT THE AGE OF TWENTY-TWO EDISON'S INVENTIONS HAD BROUGHT HIM A RELATIVELY LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND HE BECAME A VERY BUSY MANUFACTURER AND LESSEE OF A LARGE SHOP IN NEWARK NEW JERSEY
THE BRASS CONNECTIONS ON IT WERE BLACK WITH AGE AND WITH THE ARCING EFFECTS OF LIGHTNING WHICH TO YOUNG EDISON SEEMED PARTICULARLY PARTIAL TO LOUISVILLE
CLOSE AT HAND IS A MICROSCOPE WHICH IS IN FREQUENT USE BY HIM IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS
THE STORY EPITOMIZES AMERICAN IDEALISM RESTLESSNESS FREEDOM OF INDIVIDUAL OPINION AND READY ADJUSTMENT TO THE SURROUNDING CONDITIONS OF PIONEER LIFE
THE OTHER EFFECTS ARE PERHAPS OBVIOUS AND THE FIELD AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE ABSOLUTELY UNLIMITED
ABOUT TWO HOURS AFTERWARD WHEN THE MISSING BOY WAS BEING SEARCHED FOR A MAN CAME TO THE EDISON HOME TO MAKE ANXIOUS INQUIRY OF THE COMPANION WITH WHOM HE HAD LAST BEEN SEEN
ITS DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT EXTENDED AREAS AND ITS DIVISION AND SUBDIVISION INTO SMALL UNITS CONVERTED INTO LIGHT AT INNUMERABLE POINTS IN EVERY DIRECTION FROM THE SOURCE OF SUPPLY EACH UNIT TO BE INDEPENDENT OF EVERY OTHER AND SUSCEPTIBLE TO IMMEDIATE CONTROL BY THE USER
I WAS TWENTY-ONE AND VERY DUDISH
THIS DISCOVERY DID AWAY ENTIRELY WITH SLUGGISHNESS AND MADE IT POSSIBLE TO SECURE HIGH SPEEDS OVER LINES OF COMPARATIVELY GREAT LENGTHS
INTRODUCTION OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT XVI
THE LITTLE BOOK IS THE ONLY KNOWN INCURSION OF ITS AUTHOR INTO LITERATURE IF WE EXCEPT THE BRIEF ARTICLES HE HAS WRITTEN FOR TECHNICAL PAPERS AND FOR THE MAGAZINES
SITTING BULL AND FIFTEEN SIOUX INDIANS CAME TO WASHINGTON TO SEE THE GREAT FATHER AND THEN TO NEW YORK AND WENT TO THE GOERCK STREET WORKS
BRIEFLY STATED THE PRINCIPLE INVOLVED IN THE THREE-WIRE SYSTEM IS TO PROVIDE MAIN CIRCUITS OF DOUBLE THE STANDARD POTENTIAL SO AS TO OPERATE STANDARD LAMPS OR OTHER TRANSLATING DEVICES IN MULTIPLE SERIES OF TWO TO EACH SERIES
MY WIRE WAS CONNECTED TO THE BLIND SIDE OF A REPEATER AT CINCINNATI SO THAT IF I MISSED A WORD OR SENTENCE OR IF THE WIRE WORKED BADLY I COULD NOT BREAK IN AND GET THE LAST WORDS BECAUSE THE CINCINNATI MAN HAD NO INSTRUMENT BY WHICH HE COULD HEAR ME
TWOMBLY WHO WAS THEN IN CHARGE OF THE TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT OF THE WESTERN UNION
REDPATH FAMOUS AS A FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER OF JOHN BROWN AS A CIVIL WAR CORRESPONDENT AND AS FOUNDER OF THE CELEBRATED REDPATH LYCEUM BUREAU IN BOSTON DIVIDED THE COUNTRY INTO TERRITORIES EACH SECTION BEING LEASED FOR EXHIBITION PURPOSES ON A BASIS OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE GATE MONEY TO 203 BROADWAY FROM ALL OVER THE UNION FLOCKED A SWARM OF SHOWMEN CRANKS AND PARTICULARLY OF OLD OPERATORS WHO THE SEEDIER THEY WERE IN APPEARANCE THE MORE INSISTENT THEY WERE THAT TOM SHOULD GIVE THEM FOR THE SAKE OF AULD LANG SYNE THIS CHANCE TO MAKE A FORTUNE FOR HIM AND FOR THEMSELVES
ASSOCIATED WITH GENERAL PALMER WAS ONE COL
5 1881 264,650 MANUFACTURING INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
FROM SUCH WORK CAME AN EARLY FAMILIARITY WITH THE NATURE OF ELECTRICAL BATTERIES AND THE PRODUCTION OF CURRENT FROM THEM
WE WENT DOWN TO THE ANSONIA BRASS AND COPPER COMPANY AND TOLD MR COWLES JUST HOW WE STOOD
THE WORK AT THE EDISON LABORATORY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOTION PICTURE WAS AS USUAL INTENSE AND CONCENTRATED AND AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED MANY OF THE EARLY EXPERIMENTS WERE QUITE PRIMITIVE IN THEIR CHARACTER UNTIL COMMAND HAD BEEN SECURED OF RELATIVELY PERFECT APPARATUS
THUS BY COMBINING INSTRUMENTS THAT RESPOND ONLY TO VARIATION IN THE STRENGTH OF CURRENT FROM THE DISTANT STATION WITH INSTRUMENTS THAT RESPOND ONLY TO THE CHANGE IN THE DIRECTION OF CURRENT FROM THE DISTANT STATION AND BY GROUPING A PAIR OF THESE AT EACH END OF THE LINE THE QUADRUPLEX IS THE RESULT
EXILE TO BERMUDA WITH OTHER INSURGENTS WAS NOT SO ATTRACTIVE AS THE PERILS OF A FLIGHT TO THE UNITED STATES
THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY KEENLY CURIOUS AND CEASELESSLY ACTIVE IN THIS FASCINATING FIELD OF INVESTIGATION HAD NOT AFTER ALL LEFT MUCH OF A LEGACY IN EITHER PRINCIPLES OR APPLIANCES
AFTER SOME DESULTORY WANDERINGS FOR A YEAR OR TWO ALONG THE SHORES OF LAKE ERIE AMONG THE PROSPEROUS TOWNS THEN SPRINGING UP THE FAMILY WITH ITS CANADIAN HOME FORFEITED AND IN QUEST OF ANOTHER RESTING-PLACE CAME TO MILAN OHIO IN 1842
THE FIRST EMISSARY CHOSEN FOR THIS PURPOSE WAS THE LATE WILLIAM H
NOW THE ENERGY CONVERTED IS DISTRIBUTED OVER THE WHOLE RESISTANCE HENCE IF THE RESISTANCE OF THE MACHINE BE REPRESENTED BY 1 AND THE EXTERIOR CIRCUIT BY 9 THEN OF THE TOTAL ENERGY CONVERTED NINE-TENTHS WILL BE USEFUL AS IT IS OUTSIDE OF THE MACHINE AND ONE-TENTH IS LOST IN THE RESISTANCE OF THE MACHINE AFTER THIS THE CRITIC GOES ON TO SAY
THUS IN A FEW MINUTES LONGER TIME THAN IT TOOK A MULE TO WALK THE LENGTH OF ITS COIL TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION WOULD BE EFFECTED BETWEEN ALL THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY
WHILE THE PRINCIPLE INVOLVED THEREIN INDUCTION WAS NOT PRECISELY ANALOGOUS TO THE ABOVE OR TO THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY IT WAS A STEP FORWARD IN THE PROGRESS OF THE ART
WE HAD TWO-WIRE UNDERGROUND FEEDERS SENT WITHOUT ANY PLANS OR SPECIFICATIONS FOR THEIR INSTALLATION
THESE ELECTROSTATIC IMPULSES ARE TRANSMITTED INDUCTIVELY TO THE ELEVATED CONDENSING SURFACE AT THE DISTANT POINT AND ARE MADE AUDIBLE BY THE ELECTROMOTOGRAPH CONNECTED IN THE GROUND CIRCUIT WITH SUCH DISTANT CONDENSING SURFACE THE ACCOMPANYING ILLUSTRATIONS ARE REDUCED FACSIMILES OF THE DRAWINGS ATTACHED TO THE ABOVE PATENT NO
I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY
FOR WHAT TIME WAS NOT SPENT IN PERSONAL INTERVIEWS WAS REQUIRED FOR THE MASSES OF LETTERS FROM EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN ALL MAKING INQUIRIES OFFERING SUGGESTIONS PROPOSING TERMS
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER MORE INTELLECTUAL SIDE IN THE CONTACT AFFORDED WITH JOURNALISM AND ITS LEADERS AND THE INFORMATION TAKEN IN ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY AS TO THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS OF THE TIME
THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF THIS INVENTION MAY BE APPRECIATED FROM THE FACT THAT BY THE APPLICATION OF ITS PRINCIPLES THERE IS EFFECTED A SAVING OF 62 1/2 PER CENT
EDISON RECEIVED SOME STOCK FROM THE PARENT LIGHTING COMPANY BUT AS THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THAT COMPANY WAS INCREASED FROM TIME TO TIME HIS PROPORTION GREW SMALLER AND HE ULTIMATELY USED IT TO OBTAIN READY MONEY WITH WHICH TO CREATE AND FINANCE THE VARIOUS SHOPS IN WHICH WERE MANUFACTURED THE VARIOUS ITEMS OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING APPARATUS NECESSARY TO EXPLOIT HIS SYSTEM
INVESTIGATION OF THESE CASES HOWEVER REVEALED INVARIABLY THE PURELY FRAUDULENT NATURE OF ALL SUCH OFFERS WHICH WERE UNIFORMLY DECLINED
WHEN HE LEFT BOSTON AND DECIDED TO COME TO NEW YORK HE HAD ONLY MONEY ENOUGH FOR THE TRIP
IN PRACTICAL USE THE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM IS AS FOLLOWS
THE MACHINE WOULD GO AS FAST AS A HORSE COULD WALK EDISON HAS ALWAYS TAKEN A KEEN INTEREST IN AERIAL FLIGHT AND HAS ALSO EXPERIMENTED WITH AEROPLANES HIS PREFERENCE INCLINING TO THE HELICOPTER TYPE AS NOTED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS FROM TIME TO TIME
CRITICISM AND ARGUMENT WERE AGAIN AT THEIR HEIGHT WHILE UPTON AS EDISON'S DUELLIST WAS KEPT BUSY REPLYING TO PRIVATE AND PUBLIC CHALLENGES OF THE FACT
HE GOT A COPY OF PARKER'S SCHOOL PHILOSOPHY AN ELEMENTARY BOOK ON PHYSICS AND ABOUT EVERY EXPERIMENT IN IT HE TRIED
THUS WAS SWEPT AWAY THE POSSIBILITY OF REAPING THE REWARD SO RICHLY EARNED BY YEARS OF INCESSANT THOUGHT LABOR AND CARE
SOME NOTION OF HIS CEASELESS ACTIVITY MAY BE FORMED FROM THE FACT THAT HE STARTED NO FEWER THAN THREE SHOPS IN NEWARK DURING 1870-71 AND WHILE DIRECTING THESE WAS ALSO ENGAGED BY THE MEN WHO CONTROLLED THE AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY OF NEW YORK WHICH HAD A CIRCUIT TO WASHINGTON TO HELP IT OUT OF ITS DIFFICULTIES
CHAPTER XIV INVENTING A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF LIGHTING IN BERLIN ON DECEMBER 11 1908 WITH NOTABLE ECLAT THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY WAS CELEBRATED OF EMIL RATHENAU THE FOUNDER OF THE GREAT ALLGEMEIN ELEKTRICITAETS GESELLSCHAFT
HE WAS FULL IN FACE AND FIGURE ALTHOUGH BY NO MEANS AS STOUT AS HE HAS GROWN IN RECENT YEARS
FOR EDISON IN ADDITION TO INVENTING THE APPARATUS HAS OFTEN HAD TO COIN THE WORD TO DESCRIBE IT
AT THE AWARD OF THE JOHN FRITZ GOLD MEDAL IN APRIL 1909 TO CHARLES T
INDEED IT IS QUITE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF TRUTH TO SAY THAT THE CORRECT PRINCIPLES WERE BEFOGGED BY REASON OF THE LACK OF PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR ACTUAL USE
THIS DEVICE IS TOO WELL KNOWN TO REQUIRE A FURTHER DESCRIPTION
WHILE THE TERM WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY AS NOW APPLIED TO THE MODERN METHOD OF ELECTRICAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DISTANT POINTS WITHOUT INTERVENING CONDUCTORS IS SELF-EXPLANATORY IT WAS ALSO APPLICABLE STRICTLY SPEAKING TO THE PREVIOUS ART OF TELEGRAPHING TO AND FROM MOVING TRAINS AND BETWEEN POINTS NOT GREATLY REMOTE FROM EACH OTHER AND NOT CONNECTED TOGETHER WITH WIRES
A COMPANY WAS FORMED A LARGE NUMBER OF INSTRUMENTS WERE MADE AND SENT TO GOURAUD IN LONDON AND PROSPECTS WERE BRIGHT
IT WAS SAID THAT VEHICLES WITH IRON WHEELS PASSING OVER THE TRACKS AND SPANNING THE TWO RAILS WOULD SHORT-CIRCUIT THE CURRENT CHEW THEMSELVES UP AND DESTROY THE DYNAMOS GENERATING THE CURRENT BY CHOKING ALL THAT TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY BACK INTO THEM
SECOND THEY WILL ALMOST FIT
I THREW OUT HINTS OF THIS DESIRE
I WANT TO SEE YOU ABOUT MY ELECTRIC-LIGHT BILL CHINNOCK WENT UP TO SEE HIM
THE REASON FOR THE DELAY IN BEGINNING AND PUSHING SUITS FOR INFRINGEMENTS OF THE LAMP PATENT HAS NEVER BEEN GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD
SPEAKING OF THAT TIME MR ADAMS SAYS
IT SECURED FURTHER 40 PER CENT
I WENT TO THE INDICATOR AND HAVING STUDIED IT THOROUGHLY KNEW WHERE THE TROUBLE OUGHT TO BE AND FOUND IT
THE DARK HORIZONTAL LINES ARE LAYERS OF NICKEL FLAKE WHILE THE LIGHT-COLORED THICKER LAYERS REPRESENT THE NICKEL HYDRATE
YOU HAVE NO PAPERS TO SHOW ANYTHING
5 1872 135,531 CIRCUITS FOR CHEMICAL TELEGRAPHS NOV
WHEN HE STOPPED A BREATHLESS POLICEMAN GRABBED HIM BY THE THROAT AND ORDERED HIM TO DROP HIS PARCEL AND EXPLAIN MATTERS AS A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER
NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
THEY SAID THE GRADES WERE EXCESSIVE AND IT WOULD COST TOO MUCH TO DO IT WITH STEAM LOCOMOTIVES EVEN IF THEY COULD CLIMB THE GRADES
THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I WAS WITH EDISON HE SPENT MOST OF THE TIME IN THE OFFICE AT 65 FIFTH AVENUE
THEY WERE WELL-TO-DO HOWEVER AND REMOVING IN 1854 TO PORT HURON MICHIGAN OCCUPIED A LARGE COLONIAL HOUSE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN OLD GOVERNMENT FORT RESERVATION OF TEN ACRES OVERLOOKING THE WIDE EXPANSE OF THE ST CLAIR RIVER JUST AFTER IT LEAVES LAKE HURON
AS OUR BUSINESS INCREASED ENORMOUSLY OUR QUARTERS BECAME TOO SMALL SO WE SAW THE DISTRICT TAMMANY LEADER AND ASKED HIM IF WE COULD NOT STORE CASTINGS AND OTHER THINGS ON THE SIDEWALK
AND AS THE CROSS-SECTION OF A CONDUCTOR DEPENDS UPON THE QUANTITY OF CURRENT CARRIED SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT AS THE ABOVE WOULD ALLOW THE USE OF CONDUCTORS OF ONLY ONE-FOURTH THE CROSS-SECTION THAT WOULD BE OTHERWISE REQUIRED
AMONG HIS INVENTIONS MAY BE MENTIONED A MACHINE FOR MAKING FUEL FROM WHEAT STRAW AND A SMOKE-CONSUMING DEVICE
ON THE OTHER HAND SUCH STUDY WOULD REVEAL MANY CASES OF UNDOUBTED FRAUDULENT INTENT AS WELL AS MANY BOLD ATTEMPTS TO DEPRIVE THE INVENTOR OF THE FRUITS OF HIS ENDEAVORS BY THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT TO EVADE THROUGH SUBTLE TECHNICALITIES OF THE LAW THE PENALTY JUSTLY DUE THEM FOR TRICKERY EVASION OR OPEN CONTEMPT OF THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS
ON GOING TO THE BANK AND PASSING IN THE CHECK AT THE WICKET OF THE PAYING TELLER SOME BRIEF REMARKS WERE MADE TO HIM WHICH IN HIS DEAFNESS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
IF A PERSON QUALIFIED TO JUDGE WERE ASKED TO ANSWER CATEGORICALLY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT ENTERPRISE WAS A FAILURE HE COULD TRUTHFULLY ANSWER BOTH YES AND NO
ALL HIS LIFE HE HAS HAD A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH FINANCE AND COMMERCE AND AS ONE LOOKS AT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE VAST INDUSTRIES HE HAS HELPED TO CREATE IT WOULD NOT BE AT ALL UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT HIM TO BE AMONG THE MULTI-MILLIONAIRES
MOREOVER THE NEW YORK CENTRAL STATION HAD GONE INTO OPERATION STARTING AT 3 P.M
AND THE DECISION HE THEN ARRIVED AT WAS PREDESTINED TO BE THE TURNING-POINT THAT LED HIM ON TO ULTIMATE SUCCESS
TO THEM IT SEEMED BETTER TO LET ILL ALONE AND SEEK SOME OTHER CLIME WHERE CONDITIONS WOULD BE LESS ONEROUS
JAPAN CAME NEXT IN THE SUCCESSION OF COUNTRIES TO BE EXPLORED BUT THERE THE WORK WAS MUCH SIMPLIFIED FROM THE FACT THAT THE TOKIO MUSEUM CONTAINS A COMPLETE CLASSIFIED COLLECTION OF ALL THE DIFFERENT SPECIES IN THE EMPIRE AND THERE SAMPLES COULD BE OBTAINED AND TESTED
THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPHS HAD BEEN TAKEN
THE USEFUL RESULTS OBTAINABLE PREVIOUSLY FROM THE CURRENT OF A FRICTIONAL MACHINE WERE NOT MUCH GREATER THAN THOSE TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FLIGHT OF A ROCKET
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED SUBSCRIBERS
IT IS ONLY FAIR TO SAY HOWEVER THAT PROLONGED EXPERIENCE HAS LED US TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE MAXIMUM ECONOMY IN CONTINUOUS OPERATION OF THESE KILNS IS OBTAINED BY WORKING THEM AT A LITTLE LESS THAN THEIR MAXIMUM CAPACITY
THESE ARE THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS IN ALL ELECTRIC RAILROADING OF THE PRESENT DAY
THE LATTER WAS THEN ABOUT A MILE LONG
BUT EACH OF THEM HAD OR INTENDED TO HAVE ON THE BRINK OF COMPLETION AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE TELEPHONE USUALLY A NEW TRANSMITTER
HE PICKED IT UP AND LOOKING IT OVER OBSERVED THAT IT HAD A BINDING RIM MADE OF BAMBOO CUT FROM THE OUTER EDGE OF THE CANE
WHILE THE BENEFITS DERIVED WERE NOT DIRECTLY PECUNIARY IN THEIR NATURE THEY WERE SUCH AS TENDED TO STRENGTHEN COMMERCIALLY THE POSITION OF THE RIGHTFUL OWNERS OF THE PATENTS
HATING TO SEE SO MUCH WASTE EDISON TRIED TO SAVE ALL HE COULD BY EATING IT ON THE SPOT BUT AS A RESULT OUR FAMILY DOCTOR HAD THE TIME OF HIS LIFE WITH ME IN THIS CONNECTION AN ABSURD INCIDENT DESCRIBED BY EDISON THROWS A VIVID LIGHT ON THE FREE-AND-EASY CONDITION OF EARLY RAILROAD TRAVEL AND ON THE SOUTHERN EXTRAVAGANCE OF THE TIME
IT IS AS AN INVENTOR THAT HE SETS HIMSELF DOWN IN THE MEMBERSHIP LIST OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS
REFERRING TO FIG
WHILE EDISON HAS NOT FOR A LONG TIME PAST INTERESTED HIMSELF PARTICULARLY IN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER INVENTIONS THE BUREAU WHICH WAS INITIATED UNDER THE OLD REGIME IN 1889 STILL CONTINUES ENLARGED IN SCOPE DIRECTED BY ITS ORIGINAL CHIEF BUT NOW CONDUCTED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF SEVERAL ALLIED COMPANIES WHOSE GREAT VOLUMES OF COMBINED PATENTS INCLUDING THOSE OF EDISON COVER A VERY WIDE RANGE OF THE ELECTRICAL FIELD
ALL THAT MILLIONS KNOW OF MUSIC AND DRAMA HE FURNISHES
XIV
THE STORY OF THE KILN AS TOLD BY MR MALLORY IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF EDISON'S TENDENCY TO UPSET TRADITION AND MAKE A RADICAL DEPARTURE FROM GENERALLY ACCEPTED IDEAS
I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ORDER AN EXTRA TOP SINCE THAT EPISODE WHICH WILL PROBABLY BE APPRECIATED BY MOST AUTOMOBILISTS EDISON HAS TAKEN UP THE ELECTRIC AUTOMOBILE AND IS NOW USING IT AS WELL AS DEVELOPING IT
I TOLD HIM I WAS GOING TO RECORD TALKING AND THEN HAVE THE MACHINE TALK BACK
FOOTNOTE 15
ELECTRICITY TO-DAY REIGNS SUPREME IN THE FIELD OF ILLUMINATION BUT EVERY OTHER KIND OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT THAT HAS EVER BEEN KNOWN IS STILL IN USE SOMEWHERE
HANINGTON BOTH OF WHOM HAD BEEN FOR NEARLY SEVEN YEARS IN THE EMPLOY OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY IN NEW YORK
FOR THE LOCOMOTIVE A FOUR-WHEEL IRON TRUCK WAS USED AND UPON IT WAS MOUNTED ONE OF THE LONG Z TYPE 110-VOLT EDISON DYNAMOS WITH A CAPACITY OF 75 AMPERES WHICH WAS TO BE USED AS A MOTOR
ON ENTERING THE MAIN BUILDING THE FIRST DOORWAY FROM THE AMPLE PASSAGE LEADS THE VISITOR INTO A HANDSOME LIBRARY FINISHED THROUGHOUT IN YELLOW PINE OCCUPYING THE ENTIRE WIDTH OF THE BUILDING AND ALMOST AS BROAD AS LONG
NEVER BEFORE WAS SUCH A COLLECTION OF THE LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD MADE
8 WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE DIFFERENTIAL PRINCIPLE THE QUADRUPLEX WAS ALSO ARRANGED TO OPERATE ON THE WHEATSTONE BRIDGE PRINCIPLE
THE DARK BOX HAD MICROMETER SCREWS FOR DELICATE ADJUSTMENT OF THE CARBON POINTS AND WAS THEREAFTER LARGELY USED IN THIS SERIES OF INVESTIGATIONS FOR BETTER STUDY OF THE SPARK
EDISON WAS IMMENSELY IMPRESSED WITH ITS POSSIBILITIES AND GREATLY INCLINED TO WORK UPON IT BUT THE COMING OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPELLED HIM TO THROW ALL HIS ENERGIES FOR A TIME INTO THE VAST NEW FIELD AWAITING CONQUEST
AND I ATTENDED THE DINNER CELEBRATING THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DISCOVERY OF PHOTOGRAPHY
IMPRESSED WITH WHAT HE CONSIDERED THE SERIOUS INHERENT DEFECTS OF BATTERIES MADE OF THESE MATERIALS AND THE TREMENDOUSLY COMPLEX NATURE OF THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS TAKING PLACE IN ALL TYPES OF SUCH CELLS HE DETERMINED BOLDLY AT THE START THAT HE WOULD DEVISE A BATTERY WITHOUT LEAD AND ONE IN WHICH AN ALKALINE SOLUTION COULD BE USED--A FORM WHICH WOULD HE FIRMLY BELIEVED BE INHERENTLY LESS SUBJECT TO DECAY AND DISSOLUTION THAN THE STANDARD TYPE WHICH AFTER MANY SETBACKS HAD FINALLY WON ITS WAY TO AN ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF MANY THOUSANDS OF CELLS WORTH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
THERE ARE TYPICAL BRONZE VASES FROM THE SOCIETY OF ENGINEERS OF JAPAN AND A STRIKING DESK-SET OF WRITING APPARATUS FROM KRUPP ALL THE PIECES BEING MADE OUT OF TINY BUT MASSIVE GUNS AND SHELLS OF KRUPP STEEL
THE QUADRUPLEX HAS NOT AS A RULE THE SAME WORKING EFFICIENCY THAT FOUR SEPARATE WIRES HAVE
WHAT STRUCK ME ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE WAS THE WONDERFUL INTELLIGENCE AND MAGNETISM OF HIS EXPRESSION AND THE EXTREME BRIGHTNESS OF HIS EYES
HOW IS IT NOW HE REPLIED
IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD BE COMMERCIALLY IMPRACTICABLE WHERE SMALL UNITS SIMILAR TO GAS JETS WERE EMPLOYED
HE WAS NOT LAZY IN ANY SENSE
THIS COMBUSTION EFFECTS A CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION OF THE CHALK AND CAUSES IT TO ASSUME A PLASTIC CONSISTENCY AND TO COLLECT TOGETHER IN THE FORM OF SMALL SPHERICAL BALLS WHICH ARE KNOWN AS CLINKER KILNS ARE USUALLY ARRANGED WITH A SLIGHT INCLINE AT THE UPPER END OF WHICH THE CHALK IS FED IN AND GRADUALLY WORKS ITS WAY DOWN TO THE INTERIOR FLAME OF BURNING FUEL AT THE OTHER END
THEY BOUGHT TICKETS FOR PORT HURON THE TERMINAL POINT FOR THE TRAIN
JOHNSON WHOSE WORK WITH MR EDISON LAY CHIEFLY HOWEVER OUTSIDE THE LABORATORY TAKING HIM TO ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND TO EUROPE
THE PERIODS OF WEARY STRUGGLE THE DARING ADVENTURE ALONG UNKNOWN PATHS THE CLASH OF RIVAL CLAIMANTS ARE CLOSELY SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH MARK THE REVELATION AND SUBJUGATION OF A NEW CONTINENT
ONE OF THE LABORATORY ASSISTANTS WAS TOLD TO MAKE SOME OF THIS MIXTURE KNEAD IT AND ROLL SOME FILAMENTS
THE WORKING EFFICIENCY OF THE QUADRUPLEX THEREFORE WITH THE APPARATUS IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION DEPENDS ENTIRELY UPON THE SKILL OF THE OPERATORS EMPLOYED TO OPERATE IT
BUT IT STILL REMAINS TO ELUCIDATE THE ACTUAL THING DONE
HE WAS IN A GENIAL HUMOR AND PLAYED THE VIOLIN FOR ME FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS--$2000 WORTH

IT WILL BE SEEN AT ONCE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TWO KINDS OF PLATE IS RADICALLY DIFFERENT
AND HE SUCCEEDED IN PRODUCING THE LAMPS WHICH WE NOW BEHOLD EXHIBITED AT THE EXPOSITION AND ARE ADMIRED BY ALL FOR THEIR PERFECT STEADINESS THE COMPETITIVE LAMPS EXHIBITED AND TESTED AT THIS TIME COMPRISED THOSE OF EDISON MAXIM SWAN AND LANE-FOX
IT HAS BEEN SAID OF EARL DURHAM WHO PACIFIED CANADA AT THIS TIME AND ESTABLISHED THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT THAT HE MADE A COUNTRY AND MARRED A CAREER
SUCH AN OCCURRENCE WILL START HIM THINKING WHICH SOON GIVES RISE TO A LINE OF SUGGESTIONS FOR APPROACHING THE TROUBLE FROM VARIOUS SIDES
MAY 14 1897 672,616 BREAKING ROCK
IT WAS DURING THE TIME THAT I WAS DEVELOPING MY ELECTRIC-LIGHTING SYSTEM AND I WAS WORKING AND THINKING VERY HARD IN ORDER TO COVER ALL THE NUMEROUS PARTS IN ORDER THAT IT WOULD BE COMPLETE IN EVERY DETAIL
THIS MAY BE ILLUSTRATED BY A SIMPLE DIAGRAM IN WHICH G IS A GENERATOR OR SOURCE OF ENERGY FURNISHING CURRENT AT A POTENTIAL OR ELECTRICAL PRESSURE OF 110 VOLTS
LIKE THE BOXES THIS COIL WAS IN SERIES WITH THE ARMATURE AND SUBJECT TO PLUGGING IN AND OUT AT WILL BY THE MOTORMAN
GOULD HAD ONE IN HIS HOUSE OFFICE WHICH HE WATCHED CONSTANTLY
MILLIKEN IF HE DID NOT WANT AN OPERATOR WHO LIKE YOUNG LOCHINVAR CAME OUT OF THE WEST
ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT SOUTHERN EUROPE WAS THUS OPENED UP TO THE NEW SYSTEM SOUTH AMERICA CAME INTO LINE AND THE FIRST EDISON CENTRAL STATION THERE WAS INSTALLED AT SANTIAGO CHILE IN THE SUMMER OF 1883 UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF MR W
SO THE NEXT MORNING ECKERT CAME OVER WITH JAY GOULD AND INTRODUCED HIM TO ME
THIS PRODUCED A MOMENTARY RESPITE TO HIS LABORS
SOME DAY THE NOVEL MAY BE FINISHED BUT EDISON HAS NO INCLINATION TO GO BACK TO IT AND SAYS HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANY MAN IS ABLE TO MAKE A SPEECH OR WRITE A BOOK FOR HE SIMPLY CAN'T DO IT
WE ARE NOW LIGHTING ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY-THREE BUILDINGS WIRED FOR FORTY-FOUR HUNDRED LAMPS OF WHICH ABOUT TWO-THIRDS ARE IN CONSTANT USE AND WE ARE ADDING ADDITIONAL HOUSES AND LAMPS DAILY
THE LINES WERE STARTED AND THE WHOLE WAS SOLD OUT TO THE GOLD STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY
I HAD SO LITTLE MONEY LEFT THAT I NEARLY STARVED AT DECATUR ALABAMA AND HAD TO STAY THREE DAYS BEFORE GOING ON NORTH TO NASHVILLE
WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID A SMALL SUM DOWN AND THE BALANCE ON MORTGAGE
THE BOYS DID NOT TAKE TO HIM CHEERFULLY AND HE WAS LONESOME
IT IS SPLENDID
THE TABLE HEREWITH GIVEN SUMMARIZES THE FIGURES THAT HAVE JUST BEEN PRESENTED AND AFFORDS AN IDEA OF THE TOTALS AFFECTED BY THE GENIUS OF THIS ONE MAN
ALTHOUGH EDISON HAD SUCCESSFULLY OPERATED SEVERAL DYNAMOS IN MULTIPLE ARC TWO YEARS BEFORE--I.E ALL FEEDING CURRENT TOGETHER INTO THE SAME CIRCUITS--THERE WAS NOT AT THIS EARLY PERIOD OF EXPERIENCE ANY ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY AS TO WHAT PARTICULAR RESULTS MIGHT OCCUR UPON THE THROWING OF THE CURRENT FROM TWO OR MORE SUCH MASSIVE DYNAMOS INTO A GREAT DISTRIBUTING SYSTEM

A PIECE OF COAL HELD TO THE WIRE SHOWED FAINT SPARKS
JOHNSON HE MADE EXHAUSTIVE TESTS CARRYING AWAY WITH HIM TO GLASGOW UNIVERSITY THE SURPRISING RECORDS THAT HE OBTAINED
HE ALSO EXTENDED HIS SEARCHES FAR INTO THE REALMS OF NATURE IN THE LINE OF GRASSES PLANTS CANES AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND IN THESE EXPERIMENTS AT THAT TIME AND LATER HE CARBONIZED MADE INTO LAMPS AND TESTED NO FEWER THAN SIX THOUSAND DIFFERENT SPECIES OF VEGETABLE GROWTHS
WE SAY THIS NOT IN THE WAY OF AN APOLOGY FOR THE EXTENT OF EDISON'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE MOTION-PICTURE ART BECAUSE THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT HE WAS AS MUCH THE CREATOR OF THAT ART AS HE WAS OF THE PHONOGRAPHIC ART
EATON
EATON
AND THENCE TO THE TABLELAND OF BANGALORE AND THE WESTERN GHAUTS TESTING MANY KINDS OF WOOD AT EVERY POINT BUT PARTICULARLY THE PALM AND BAMBOO FAMILIES
THE LANDLORD KEPT GOING AMONG HIS TENANTS AND FINALLY DISCOVERED THE DYNAMO
IN FACT IF IT WERE NOT FOR EDISON'S PECULIAR MENTALITY THAT REFUSES TO RECOGNIZE ANYTHING AS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL INDUBITABLY DEMONSTRATED TO BE SO THE PRODUCTION OF MOTION PICTURES WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN DELAYED FOR YEARS IF NOT FOR ALL TIME
THE AGGLOMERATION OF THE CONCENTRATES HAVING BEEN DECIDED UPON TWO OTHER CONSIDERATIONS NOT MENTIONED ABOVE WERE OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE--FIRST TO FIND A SUITABLE CHEAP BINDING MATERIAL
NOVEMBER 22 1875
ANY ONE HAVING THESE CAPACITIES DEVELOPED TO THE SAME EXTENT WITH THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES FOR USE WOULD PROBABLY ACCOMPLISH AS MUCH
THUS THE DEMAND FOR THE NEW MACHINES AND WAX RECORDS GREW APACE AS THE CORPORATIONS ORGANIZED TO HANDLE THE BUSINESS EXTENDED THEIR LINES
WHAT HAS NOW BEEN MADE CLEAR BY ACCURATE NOMENCLATURE WAS THEN VERY FOGGY IN THE TEXT-BOOKS
I MADE A GREAT MANY INVENTIONS
THIS OF ITSELF WAS A SUBJECT OF MUCH IMPORTANCE AND A VAST AMOUNT OF RESEARCH AND LABOR WAS EXPENDED UPON IT

METHOD OF DISTILLING LIQUIDS BY INCANDESCENT CONDUCTOR IMMERSED IN THE LIQUID
HE WAS AN AUSTERE MAN AND I WAS AFRAID OF HIM
IT IS ALL ONE PIECE OF SOBER CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND STUBBORN SUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON THE PROBLEM
I CAN NEVER FORGET THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS FIRST VIEW OF THE ELECTRIC-LIGHTING INDUSTRY PRODUCED ON ME
BY REFERRING TO THE DIAGRAM IT WILL BE SEEN THAT EACH SERIES OF TWO FORMS ONE CONTINUOUS PATH BETWEEN THE MAIN CONDUCTORS AND IF THIS PATH BE BROKEN AT ANY ONE POINT CURRENT WILL IMMEDIATELY CEASE TO FLOW IN THAT PARTICULAR SERIES
EDISON'S CARBON TRANSMITTER OVERCAME THIS VITAL OR LIMITING WEAKNESS BY PROVIDING FOR INDEPENDENT POWER ON THE TRANSMISSION CIRCUIT AND BY INTRODUCING THE PRINCIPLE OF VARYING THE RESISTANCE OF THAT CIRCUIT WITH CHANGES IN THE PRESSURE
NO ONE EVER GOES AWAY FROM EDISON IN DOUBT AS TO WHAT HE THINKS OR MEANS BUT HE IS EVER SHY AND DIFFIDENT TO A DEGREE IF THE TALK TURNS ON HIMSELF RATHER THAN ON HIS WORK
SAWDUST OF BOXWOOD 3 LBS
AFTER SOME CONSIDERATION OF THE GEARING QUESTION IT WAS DECIDED TO EMPLOY BELTS INSTEAD OF THE FRICTION-PULLEYS ACCORDINGLY EDISON INSTALLED ON THE LOCOMOTIVE A SYSTEM OF BELTING INCLUDING AN IDLER-PULLEY WHICH WAS USED BY MEANS OF A LEVER TO TIGHTEN THE MAIN DRIVING-BELT AND THUS POWER WAS APPLIED TO THE DRIVEN AXLE
INDEED IS STILL IN USE THERE
BUT FOR MANY YEARS ONE NEVER SAW AN EDISON INSTALLATION WITHOUT EXPECTING TO FIND ONE OR MORE ARMINGTON SIMS HIGH-SPEED ENGINES PART OF IT
TWO OF THE Z TYPE DYNAMOS WERE USED FOR GENERATING THE CURRENT WHICH WAS CONVEYED TO THE TWO RAILS OF THE ROAD BY UNDERGROUND CONDUCTORS
WHY SAID EDISON I WOULD SIMPLY TAKE THAT BULB AND FILL IT WITH MERCURY AND WEIGH IT
THROUGHOUT THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE SEARCH FOR A PRACTICAL ELECTRIC LIGHT WAS ALMOST WHOLLY IN THE DIRECTION OF EMPLOYING METHODS ANALOGOUS TO THOSE ALREADY FAMILIAR
EVERY LAMP THE WORLD HAD EVER KNOWN DID THIS IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
HE HAD SEVERAL COTS PLACED IN THE ADJOINING BUILDING AND HE AND A FEW OF HIS MOST STRENUOUS ASSISTANTS WORKED DAY AND NIGHT LEAVING THE WORK ONLY FOR HURRIED MEALS AND A SNATCH OF SLEEP
BUT TO THE OPERATORS OF LONG TRUNK LINES IT MUST HAVE SEEMED UTTERLY INSIGNIFICANT AND EXCELLENT FOOLING SPEAKING OF THIS SITUATION MR EDISON SAYS
I HADN'T ANY PARTICULAR WORK TO GIVE HIM BUT I HAD A NUMBER OF SMALL INDUCTION COILS AND TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO DO I TOLD HIM TO FIX THEM UP AND SELL THEM AMONG HIS SAILOR FRIENDS
THE PRESENT CHAPTER ESSENTIALLY TECHNICAL IN ITS SUBJECT-MATTER IS PERHAPS AS SIGNIFICANT AS ANY IN THIS BIOGRAPHY BECAUSE IT PRESENTS EDISON AS THE MASTER IMPRESARIO OF HIS AGE AND MAYBE OF MANY FOLLOWING AGES ALSO
IT IS GOING TO BE A MOST VALUABLE PRACTICAL AFFAIR--AS VALUABLE AS WATER-CISTERNS TO PEOPLE WHETHER THEY HAD OR HAD NOT SYSTEMS OF WATER-PIPES AND WATER-SUPPLY INDEED IN ONE OUTBURST OF PANEGYRIC THE SHREWD PHYSICIST REMARKED THAT HE SAW IN IT A REALIZATION OF THE MOST ARDENTLY AND INCREASINGLY FELT SCIENTIFIC ASPIRATION OF HIS LIFE--AN ASPIRATION WHICH HE HARDLY DARED TO EXPECT OR TO SEE REALIZED A LITTLE LATER HOWEVER SIR WILLIAM ALWAYS CAUTIOUS AND CANNY BEGAN TO DISCOVER THE INHERENT DEFECTS OF THE PRIMITIVE BATTERY AS TO DISINTEGRATION INEFFICIENCY COSTLINESS ETC AND THOUGH OFFERED TEMPTING INDUCEMENTS DECLINED TO LEND HIS NAME TO ITS FINANCIAL INTRODUCTION
DURING THE FIRST TWO MONTHS EDISON'S FATHER TOOK IN THREE DOLLARS AND FELT EXTREMELY BLUE OVER THE PROSPECT AND TO YOUNG EDISON AND HIS RELATIVES WERE LEFT THE LONELY PLEASURES OF THE LOOKOUT AND THE ENJOYMENT OF THE TELESCOPE WITH WHICH IT WAS EQUIPPED
IT UTILIZES IN THE ARC FROM 38 TO 41 PER CENT
OF HIM EDISON SAYS
WHEN THAT OBJECT HAS BEEN ATTAINED HOWEVER AND IT PASSES FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL TO THE COMMERCIAL STAGE EDISON'S MONETARY VIEWS AGAIN COME INTO STRONG PLAY BUT THEY TAKE A DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE POSITION FOR HE THEN BEGINS IMMEDIATELY TO PLAN THE EXTREME OF ECONOMY IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE ARTICLE
SOME PERSONS WILL BE CONTENT IF THEY ARE TOLD SIMPLY THAT IT IS A WAY WHICH ELECTRICITY HAS OF BEHAVING

THE SAME CAUTIOUS FORESIGHT EXERCISED BY EDISON IN PROVIDING A SAFETY DEVICE--THE FUSE--TO PREVENT FIRES IN HIS ELECTRIC-LIGHT SYSTEM WAS AGAIN DISPLAYED IN THIS CONCENTRATING PLANT WHERE TO SAVE POSSIBLE INJURY TO ITS EXPENSIVE OPERATING PARTS HE DEVISED AN ANALOGOUS FACTOR PROVIDING ALL THE CRUSHING MACHINERY WITH CLOSELY CALCULATED SAFETY PINS WHICH ON BEING OVERLOADED WOULD SHEAR OFF AND THUS STOP THE MACHINE AT ONCE

THE PAUCITY OF CONTROLLING CLAIMS OBTAINED IN THESE EARLY PATENTS IS REMARKABLE IT IS NOTORIOUS THAT EDISON DID NOT THEN ENJOY THE SKILFUL AID IN SAFEGUARDING HIS IDEAS THAT HE COMMANDED LATER
A MINIMUM OF MACHINERY AND PARTS
ONLY TWO DAYS COULD I GET ON DECK AND ON ONE OF THESE A GENTLEMAN HAD A BAD SCALP WOUND FROM BEING THROWN AGAINST THE IRON WALL OF A SMALL SMOKING-ROOM ERECTED OVER A FREIGHT HATCH ARRIVED IN LONDON EDISON SET UP HIS APPARATUS AT THE TELEGRAPH STREET HEADQUARTERS AND SENT HIS COMPANION TO LIVERPOOL WITH THE INSTRUMENTS FOR THAT END
BUT ONCE THE FEED ROLL DIDN'T SAVE IT AND THE FLAME WENT THROUGH AND EXPLODED THE WHOLE ROLL AND KICKED UP SUCH A BAD EXPLOSION I ABANDONED IT
EVIDENTLY THE PUBLIC DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE ECCENTRIC ARTIST BLAKE IN HIS MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN AND HELL WHEN HE SAID
HE MADE MONEY OUT OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT

THE WAY OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD
INJUNCTIONS WERE OBTAINED AGAINST MANY OLD OFFENDERS AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE EDISON INTERESTS WERE ABOUT TO COME INTO THEIR OWN FOR THE BRIEF UNEXPIRED TERM OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PATENT WHEN A NEW BOMBSHELL WAS DROPPED INTO THE EDISON CAMP IN THE SHAPE OF AN ALLEGED ANTICIPATION OF THE INVENTION FORTY YEARS PREVIOUSLY BY ONE HENRY GOEBEL

THE POLE-PIECES OF THE MAGNET WERE MOVABLE AND WOULD BE ATTRACTED TO THE REVOLVING DISK WHEN THE MAGNET WAS ENERGIZED GRASPING THE SAME AND ACTING TO RETARD THE REVOLUTION OF THE CAR AXLE INTERESTING ARTICLES ON EDISON'S FIRST ELECTRIC RAILROAD WERE PUBLISHED IN THE TECHNICAL AND OTHER PAPERS AMONG WHICH MAY BE MENTIONED THE NEW YORK HERALD MAY 15 AND JULY 23 1880
IN THIS CASE HIS LABORS WERE DIRECTED TOWARD IMPROVING THE PHONOGRAPH SO AS TO PUT IT INTO THOROUGHLY PRACTICABLE FORM CAPABLE OF ORDINARY USE BY THE PUBLIC AT LARGE
A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THE CORRECTNESS OF THIS PROPOSITION IS AFFORDED IN THE PRESENT CASE WHEN IT IS BORNE IN MIND THAT THESE VARIOUS INDUSTRIES ABOVE DESCRIBED WHOSE ANNUAL SALES RUN INTO MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OWE NOT ONLY THEIR VERY CREATION EXCEPT THE BATES MACHINE AND EXISTENCE TO EDISON'S INVENTIVE ORIGINALITY AND COMMERCIAL INITIATIVE BUT ALSO THEIR CONTINUED GROWTH AND PROSPERITY TO HIS INCESSANT ACTIVITIES IN DEALING WITH THEIR MULTIFARIOUS BUSINESS PROBLEMS
IT IS WORTHY OF NOTE AS TO THE PROMPTNESS WITH WHICH THE EDISON STATIONS BECAME PAYING PROPERTIES THAT FOUR OF THE METERED STATIONS WERE EARNING UPWARD OF 15 PER CENT

YOUNG GOEBEL TRIED TO SELL IT
AFTER STOPPING AT HOME FOR SOME TIME I GOT RESTLESS AND THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE TO WORK IN THE EAST
HE WAS A YOUTH OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS DECIDEDLY UNPREPOSSESSING IN DRESS AND RATHER UNCOUTH IN MANNER
HAD HE THEN REALIZED THE FULL IMPORT OF HIS DISCOVERY ALL HE NEEDED WAS TO INCREASE THE STRENGTH OF THE WAVES AND TO PROVIDE A VERY SENSITIVE DETECTOR LIKE THE COHERER IN ORDER TO HAVE ANTICIPATED THE PRINCIPAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT CAME MANY YEARS AFTERWARD
DOCTOR BEARD WAS PRESENT WHEN THIS WAS TRIED DECEMBER 5 1875
THE STRIP A IS FIRST PUT UNDER A SLIGHT PRESSURE DEFLECTING THE NEEDLE A FEW DEGREES FROM ZERO
THE STUDY OF APPARATUS FOR OBTAINING MORE PERFECT VACUA WAS UNCEASINGLY CARRIED ON FOR EDISON REALIZED THAT IN THIS THERE LAY A POTENT FACTOR OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS
INVENTORS OF PRACTICAL DEVICES MAY BE BROADLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES--FIRST THOSE WHO MAY BE SAID TO HAVE MADE TWO BLADES OF GRASS GROW WHERE ONLY ONE GREW BEFORE
I HAVE VERY PLEASANT RECOLLECTIONS OF MR EDISON AT THESE TIMES
I NEVER WAS ASKED TO PAY FREIGHT AND TO THIS DAY CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT THAT I WAS SO SMALL AND INDUSTRIOUS AND THE NERVE TO APPROPRIATE A U
CARBON AS A MATERIAL DETERMINED AFTER PATIENT SEARCH APPARENTLY OFFERED THE GREATEST HOPE BUT EVEN WITH THIS SUBSTANCE THE NECESSARY HIGH RESISTANCE COULD BE OBTAINED ONLY BY MAKING THE BURNER OF EXTREMELY SMALL CROSS-SECTION THEREBY ALSO REDUCING ITS RADIATING SURFACE

I WAITED AWHILE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING TO OCCUR AND THEN WENT INTO THE SMOKING-COMPARTMENT
I THINK IT WAS EXHIBITED BEFORE A COMMITTEE THAT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE CAPITOL
I DO NOT THINK HE WEIGHED OVER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE POUNDS
BUT IT MAY BE SERIOUSLY QUESTIONED WHETHER IN THE AGGREGATE EDISON'S VISITORS ARE LESS NUMEROUS OR LESS TIME-CONSUMING THAN HIS EPISTOLARY BESIEGERS
MR CRAIG BROUGHT WITH HIM AT THIS TIME--THE EARLY SEVENTIES--FROM MILWAUKEE A MR SHOLES WHO HAD A WOODEN MODEL OF A MACHINE TO WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN THE THEN NEW AND UNFAMILIAR NAME OF TYPEWRITER CRAIG WAS INTERESTED IN THE MACHINE AND PUT THE MODEL IN EDISON'S HANDS TO PERFECT
THE LABORATORY NOTE-BOOKS OF THE PERIOD BEAR ABUNDANT EVIDENCE OF THE SYSTEMATIC AND SEARCHING NATURE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS IN THE HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF NOTES SKETCHES CALCULATIONS AND TABLES MADE AT THE TIME BY EDISON UPTON BATCHELOR JEHL AND BY OTHERS WHO FROM TIME TO TIME WERE INTRUSTED WITH SPECIAL EXPERIMENTS TO ELUCIDATE SOME PARTICULAR POINT
THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE INDUSTRIES WILL BE APPARENT WHEN IT IS STATED THAT AT THIS PLANT THE MAXIMUM PAY-ROLL SHOWS THE EMPLOYMENT OF OVER 4200 PERSONS WITH ANNUAL EARNINGS IN SALARIES AND WAGES OF MORE THAN $2,750,000
EACH ROLL HAD ALSO TWO ROWS OF FOUR-INCH KNOBS INTENDED TO STRIKE A SERIES OF HAMMER-LIKE BLOWS
OF THE ORE CHARGE
YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS REMENYI
THE MAGIC OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS AND THE RUMORS OF WHAT IS BEING DONE HAVE CAUSED A WILD DROP IN GAS SECURITIES AND A SENSATIONAL RISE IN HIS OWN ELECTRIC-LIGHT STOCK FROM $100 TO $3500 A SHARE
THIS IDEA WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ADOPTED BY A GREAT MANUFACTURER OF GENERATORS
HAVING MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN HIS GRINDING AND SCREENING APPARATUS AND BELIEVING THAT IN THE FUTURE ENGINEERS BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS WOULD EVENTUALLY REQUIRE A HIGHER DEGREE OF FINENESS HE DETERMINED IN ADVANCE OF MANUFACTURING TO RAISE THE STANDARD TEN POINTS SO THAT AT LEAST 85 PER CENT
NATURAL PRODUCTS SUCH AS WOODS BARKS ROOTS LEAVES NUTS SEEDS HERBS GUMS GRAINS FLOURS MEALS BRAN
SIX MONTHS LATER AS WE HAVE SEEN HE HAD ALREADY MADE HIS MARK AND THE SAME JOURNAL IN OCTOBER 1869 COULD SAY

BY FAR THE MOST PERPLEXING OF THESE NEW MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS WAS THE LAMP

MEANTIME LITTLE MILAN HAD REACHED THE ZENITH OF ITS PROSPERITY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF ITS FLOURISHING GRAIN TRADE BY THE NEW COLUMBUS SANDUSKY HOCKING RAILROAD
AS I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND OR SPEAK A WORD OF FRENCH I WENT TO SEE OUR MINISTER MR WHITELAW REID AND GOT HIM TO SEND A DEPUTY TO ANSWER FOR ME WHICH HE DID WITH MY GRATEFUL THANKS
THIS APPARATUS AS INVENTED BY EDISON CONSISTS OF A FLARING BOX CURVED AT ONE END TO FIT CLOSELY OVER THE FOREHEAD AND EYES WHILE THE OTHER END OF THE BOX IS CLOSED BY A PASTE-BOARD COVER
THIS I DID AND I SENT TWO OF MY ASSISTANTS WHOM I COULD TRUST DOWN TO THIS PLACE TO ERECT THE PLANT
THUS IN AN INCONCEIVABLY BRIEF TIME HAD EDISON PASSED FROM POVERTY TO INDEPENDENCE
UP IN THE TOP LOFT OF THE FACTORY WE STORED THOSE MACHINES AND AT NIGHT WE PUT UP THE BENCHES AND GOT EVERYTHING ALL READY
INASMUCH AS THERE WERE SEVERAL PROPOSED SYSTEMS OF RAPID AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHY IN EXISTENCE AT THE TIME EDISON ENTERED THE FIELD BUT NONE OF THEM IN PRACTICAL COMMERCIAL USE IT BECOMES A MATTER OF INTEREST TO INQUIRE WHEREIN THEY WERE DEFICIENT AND WHAT CONSTITUTED THE ELEMENTS OF EDISON'S SUCCESS
WHAT HAS ALWAYS PUZZLED ME SINCE IS THAT I DID NOT THINK OF USING THE RESULTS OF MY EXPERIMENTS ON ETHERIC FORCE THAT I MADE IN 1875
ON ONE OCCASION WE GOT OUTSIDE SANDY HOOK ON THE BANKS AND ANCHORED
IT IS NOT TO BE IMAGINED FOR ONE MOMENT THAT EDISON PERFORMED ALL THE EXPERIMENTS WITH HIS OWN HANDS
DURING THIS HALF REVOLUTION THE SEGMENTAL WHEELS HAVE ALSO BEEN TURNING AND THE BRUSHES HAVE TRANSMITTED A NUMBER OF CURRENT IMPULSES TO TM WHICH HAVE CAUSED IT TO OPERATE THE ESCAPEMENT A CORRESPONDING NUMBER OF TIMES THUS TURNING THE TYPE-WHEELS AROUND TO THE LETTER M
DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE MAIN DOOR IS A BEAUTIFUL MARBLE STATUE PURCHASED BY EDISON AT THE PARIS EXPOSITION IN 1889 ON THE OCCASION OF HIS VISIT THERE
ON ACCOUNT OF THE POSITION OF THE CORRESPONDING PIN THE CYLINDER WOULD MAKE NEARLY HALF A REVOLUTION BEFORE BRINGING THE PIN TO THE KEY
EDISON SEPTEMBER 19 1882
HE SEEMED TO THINK HIS PARTY WOULD AGREE TO THIS
THE NEGATIVES SO OBTAINED ARE DEVELOPED IN THE REGULAR WAY AND THE POSITIVE PRINTS SUBSEQUENTLY MADE FROM THEM ARE USED FOR REPRODUCTION
THEY TOOK HIM UP TO THE HOSPITAL--A PORTUGUESE ONE--WHERE HE COULD NOT SPEAK THE LANGUAGE AND THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH
FIVE HAD REFERENCE TO INVENTIONS OF PARTS SUCH AS MOTORS SOCKETS ETC
HE NOW RECANTED PUBLICLY IN THIS LANGUAGE WHICH IN ITSELF SHOWS THE STATE OF THE ART WHEN EDISON CAME TO THE FRONT
THE NEXT DAY MR EDISON MR INSULL AND THE CHIEF ENGINEER OF THE CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT APPEARED ON THE SCENE AND WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED
THE METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING VOCAL OR OTHER SOUNDS TELEGRAPHICALLY AS HEREIN DESCRIBED BY CAUSING ELECTRICAL UNDULATIONS SIMILAR IN FORM TO THE VIBRATIONS OF THE AIR ACCOMPANYING THE SAID VOCAL OR OTHER SOUNDS SUBSTANTIALLY AS SET FORTH IT WAS A LONG TIME HOWEVER BEFORE THE INCLUSIVE NATURE OF THIS GRANT OVER EVERY POSSIBLE TELEPHONE WAS UNDERSTOOD OR RECOGNIZED AND LITIGATION FOR AND AGAINST THE PATENT LASTED DURING ITS ENTIRE LIFE

BUT I FOUND THAT IN THE MIRROR FACTORIES WHERE MERCURY WAS USED EXTENSIVELY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT MADE THE GIVING OF IODIDE OF POTASSIUM COMPULSORY TO PREVENT SALIVATION
AND WHEN SHE WAS GOOD SHE WAS VERY VERY GOOD BUT WHEN SHE WAS BAD SHE WAS HORRID IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT SENATOR ROSCOE CONKLING THEN VERY PROMINENT HAD A CURL OF HAIR ON HIS FOREHEAD
I REMEMBER ONE TIME WE WERE GOING UP ON THE HUDSON RIVER BOAT TO INSPECT THE WORKS AND WITH US WAS MR HENDERSON OUR CHIEF ENGINEER WHO WAS CERTAINLY THE BEST RACONTEUR OF FUNNY STORIES I EVER KNEW
WE RIGGED UP THE LINE BETWEEN THE TWO ENDS OF THE ROOM EDISON TAKING THE STAGE WHILE I WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
25 1897 637,327 ROLLS
BUT ONLY ONE THOUSAND AMPERES PASSED THROUGH IT--I.E THE AMOUNT REQUIRED BY A SINGLE CAR AND OF COURSE MUCH LESS THAN THE CAPACITY OF THE GENERATORS ABLE TO OPERATE A SYSTEM OF SEVERAL HUNDRED CARS
SMALL WONDER THEN THAT WHEN HE WAS PREPARED TO MARKET HIS INVENTION HE SHOULD FIND OTHERS ENTERING THAT MARKET AT HOME AND ABROAD AT THE SAME TIME AND WITH SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR MERCHANDISE
HERE ALSO ARE OTHER CABINETS CONTAINING OLD PAPERS AND RECORDS WHILE FURTHER ALONG THE WALL ARE PILED UP BOXES OF HISTORICAL MODELS AND INSTRUMENTS
LET'S RUN UP-STAIRS BERGMANN AGREED AND RAN UP
FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER THE FISHING WAS VERY POOR
THE PEARL STREET STATION WAS OFFICIALLY STARTED BY ADMITTING STEAM TO THE ENGINE OF ONE OF THE JUMBOS CURRENT WAS GENERATED TURNED INTO THE NETWORK OF UNDERGROUND CONDUCTORS AND WAS TRANSFORMED INTO LIGHT BY THE INCANDESCENT LAMPS THAT HAD THUS FAR BEEN INSTALLED
BUT THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ARC LIGHT BROUGHT AN ENTIRELY NEW MENACE IN THE USE OF PRESSURES THAT WERE EVEN WORSE THAN THE BULLY OF THE WEST WHO KILLS ON SIGHT BECAUSE THIS KINDRED PERIL WAS INVISIBLE AND MIGHT LURK ANYWHERE
IN THE FOLLOWING DIAGRAM WHICH SHOWS THE THEORY OF THIS ARRANGEMENT IT WILL BE SEEN THAT BOTH THE TRANSMITTING ROLLERS AND THE RECEIVING PINS ARE ARRANGED IN PAIRS ONE PAIR IN EACH CASE BEING SLIGHTLY IN ADVANCE OF THE OTHER
HE ASKED ME HOW I KNEW OF ANY MESSAGE
MR THOMSON MADE THE OBJECTION THAT IT WAS IMPRACTICABLE AND THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPLANT STEAM
31 THE LOWEST ROLL WAS SET IN A FIXED BEARING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME AND THEREFORE COULD ONLY TURN AROUND ON ITS AXIS
DETECTION AND A REPRIMAND CAME IN DUE COURSE BUT WERE NOT TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY
IT OUGHT TO BE KNOWN TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE MAKING OR USING MACHINES
ON THE CONTRARY HE PROSPERED IN BOTH HIS ENTERPRISES UNTIL PERSUADED BY THE PRINTER'S DEVIL IN THE OFFICE OF THE PORT HURON COMMERCIAL TO CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF HIS JOURNAL ENLARGE IT AND ISSUE IT UNDER THE NAME OF PAUL PRY A HAPPY DESIGNATION FOR THIS OR KINDRED VENTURES IN THE DOMAIN OF SOCIETY JOURNALISM
AN IDEA OF THE CONDITIONS INSIDE A LOADED TUBE CAN BEST BE HAD BY MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION
INVESTIGATOR THIS WAS ONE OF THE MANY ANONYMOUS LETTERS THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN TO THE NEWSPAPERS ON THE SUBJECT AND THE FOLLOWING REPLY BY THE EDISON COMPANY WAS PRINTED DECEMBER 3 1882
SINCE EDISON COMPLETED HIS FINAL SERIES OF INVESTIGATIONS ON HIS STORAGE BATTERY AND BROUGHT IT TO ITS PRESENT STATE OF PERFECTION THE COMMERCIAL VALUES HAVE INCREASED BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS
YES THAT'S IT
I WAS TAKEN THERE AND FOUND MR HAYES AND SEVERAL OTHERS WAITING
WHEN THE RAGMAN HEARD THIS HE TOOK THAT SIDE AT ONCE
THEY ARE NOT NEEDED
WE HAD AN INDEX LIKE A STEAM-GAUGE CALLED AN AMPERE-METER TO INDICATE THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT GOING OUT
I AM WILLING TO HELP YOU
I DECIDED THAT INSTEAD OF THE USUAL ONE HUNDRED PAPERS I COULD SELL ONE THOUSAND
THE ILLUSTRATION HERE PRESENTED IS COPIED FROM THE DRAWING FORMING PART OF THIS PATENT
THE CROWDS ARE PATIENT HOWEVER AND IN ONE EDISON PICTURE INVOLVING THE BLOWING UP OF A BRIDGE BY THE VILLAIN OF THE PIECE AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF A PONTOON BRIDGE BY A COMPANY OF ENGINEERS JUST IN TIME TO ALLOW THE HEROINE TO PASS OVER IN HER AUTOMOBILE MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE STOOD AROUND FOR ALMOST AN ENTIRE DAY WAITING FOR THE TEDIOUS REHEARSALS TO END AND THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE TO BEGIN
SOME OF THE FIRST IF NOT THE VERY FIRST OF THE INSULATED FIXTURES WERE USED IN THIS PLANT AND MANY OF THE FIXTURES WERE EQUIPPED WITH BALL INSULATING JOINTS ENABLING THE CHANDELIERS--OR ELECTROLIERS'--TO BE TURNED AROUND AS WAS COMMON WITH THE GAS CHANDELIERS
IN ABOUT TWO HOURS THINGS WERE WORKING AGAIN
WHAT YOU WANT IS A PARTNER I FELT VERY MUCH CRESTFALLEN
WHAT I NEEDED WAS PASTRY
HE COLLECTED EVERY KIND OF INFORMATION AND STATISTICS ABOUT HIS SCHEMES AND HAD ALL THE DATA
THE CURRENT PRESSURE WAS REGULATED BY A GALVANOMETER
SINCE THE BULK OF ONCOMING MATERIAL WAS SMALL THE GASES WERE NOT CALLED UPON TO PART WITH MUCH OF THEIR HEAT AND THEREFORE PASSED ON UP THE STACK AT VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM 1500 DEGREES TO 1800 DEGREES FAHR
FIRST ONE LANTERN WENT OUT THEN THE OTHER

THIS SILENT GROUP OF BUILDINGS COMPRISES THE FAMOUS OLD LABORATORY AND WORKSHOPS OF MR EDISON HISTORIC AS BEING THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE CARBON TRANSMITTER THE PHONOGRAPH THE INCANDESCENT LAMP AND THE SPOT WHERE EDISON ALSO WORKED OUT HIS SYSTEMS OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION HIS COMMERCIAL DYNAMO HIS ELECTRIC RAILWAY HIS MEGAPHONE HIS TASIMETER AND MANY OTHER INVENTIONS OF GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE
HE REALIZED HOWEVER THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE OPERATION OF AN ENTIRELY NOVEL PLANT THERE WAS AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR UNEXPECTED CONTINGENCIES ALTHOUGH THE GREATEST CARE HAD BEEN EXERCISED TO MAKE EVERYTHING AS PERFECT AS POSSIBLE

THE COMPETITION WAS MOST SALUTARY IN THE STIMULUS IT GAVE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN PROCESSES FOR MAKING DISTRIBUTING AND USING GAS SO THAT WHILE VAST ECONOMIES HAVE BEEN EFFECTED AT THE GAS WORKS THE CUSTOMER HAS HAD AN INFINITELY BETTER LIGHT FOR LESS MONEY
BUT WHEN HE DID ARRIVE I MISTOOK THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE FOR HIM THE DUKE BEING A FINE-LOOKING MAN
INDEED ONCE STARTED THIS STATION WAS OPERATED UNINTERRUPTEDLY FOR EIGHT YEARS WITH ONLY INSIGNIFICANT STOPPAGE
BUT HE AND HIS CHUM HAD A LINE BETWEEN THEIR HOMES BUILT OF COMMON STOVE-PIPE WIRE
ON RETURNING TO THE STATION I PASSED AWAY THE TIME SHOOTING AT CANS SET ON A PILE OF TINS
BUT THE TROLLEY HAD ITS WAY EXCEPT ON A FEW LINES WHERE THE CONDUIT-AND-SHOE METHOD WAS ADOPTED
BUT NEXT DAY I LEARNED THAT INSTEAD OF THERE BEING A VOTE THE CONVENTION HAD ADJOURNED WITHOUT ACTION UNTIL THE DAY AFTER IN LIKE MANNER IT WAS AT LOUISVILLE THAT MR EDISON GOT AN INSIGHT INTO THE MANNER IN WHICH GREAT POLITICAL SPEECHES ARE MORE FREQUENTLY REPORTED THAN THE PUBLIC SUSPECTS
AT THIS JUNCTURE OTHER SCHEMES WERE FERMENTING IN HIS BRAIN
THE PHONOGRAPH OF TO-DAY EXCEPT FOR THE PERFECTION OF ITS MECHANICAL FEATURES IN ITS BEAUTY OF MANUFACTURE AND DESIGN AND IN SMALL DETAILS MAY BE CONSIDERED IDENTICAL WITH THE MACHINE OF 1889 WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT WITH THE LATTER THE ROTATION OF THE RECORD CYLINDER WAS EFFECTED BY AN ELECTRIC MOTOR
NUMEROUS INGENIOUS INVENTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BY EDISON PROVIDING FOR A VARIETY OF RAPID AND ECONOMICAL METHODS OF DUPLICATION INCLUDING METHODS OF SHRINKING A NEWLY MADE COPY TO FACILITATE ITS QUICK REMOVAL FROM THE MOLD
AT OTHER TIMES THE UNSETTLED CONDITION PERSISTS AND HIS SPLEEN IS VENTED NOT ONLY ON THE ORIGINAL INSTIGATOR BUT UPON OTHERS WHO MAY HAVE OCCASION TO SEE HIM SOMETIMES HOURS AFTERWARD
I TOLD HIM AND HE ASKED ME TO COME TO HIS PRIVATE OFFICE THE FOLLOWING DAY
DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE STORAGE BATTERY INVESTIGATIONS AFTER THE FORM OF POSITIVE ELEMENT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UPON IT BECAME NECESSARY TO ASCERTAIN WHAT DEFINITE PROPORTIONS AND WHAT QUALITY OF NICKEL HYDRATE AND NICKEL FLAKE WOULD GIVE THE BEST RESULTS
BY THIS TIME THREE MORE JUMBOS HAD BEEN ADDED TO THE PLANT
WITH THE CLOSE OF MR MCGOWAN'S AND MR RICALTON'S EXPEDITIONS THERE ENDED THE HISTORIC WORLD-HUNT FOR NATURAL FIBRES
THOSE WHO WERE GATHERED AROUND HIM IN THE OLD MENLO PARK LABORATORY ENJOYED HIS CONFIDENCE AND HE THEIRS
AS AN EXAMPLE OF EDISON'S FERTILITY AND THE ENDLESS VARIETY OF SUBJECTS ENGAGING HIS THOUGHTS THE FOLLOWING LIST OF MATTERS COVERED BY ONE CAVEAT IS GIVEN
IT IS TRUE THAT MANY OF THESE FACTORIES ARE OPERATED BY OTHER THAN THE INTERESTS WHICH CAME INTO CONTROL OF THE EDISON PATENTS GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY BUT THE 150,000,000 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS NOW ANNUALLY MADE ARE BROADLY COVERED IN PRINCIPLE BY EDISON'S FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS AND PATENTS
THIRD THEY DO NOT FIT AND CAN'T BE MADE TO FIT FOOTNOTE 2
THE CURRENT FROM A SMALL BATTERY SUFFICES TO ENERGIZE THE PEN AND WITH THE STENCIL THUS MADE HUNDREDS OF COPIES OF THE DOCUMENT CAN BE FURNISHED
AND THIS IS EQUALLY TRUE AS APPLIED TO MANY SCORES OF OTHERS WORKING IN COMPANIES BEARING THE EDISON NAME OR ORGANIZED UNDER EDISON PATENTS
ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED WAS TO KEEP THE GATE CLOSED AND RATTLE THE LATCH SOFTLY
I WAS INTERESTED AS A TELEGRAPHER IN JOURNALISM AND STARTED THE TELEGRAPH JOURNAL AND GOT OUT ABOUT A DOZEN NUMBERS WHEN IT WAS TAKEN OVER BY W
IN THIS DIAGRAM G<1S> AND G<2S> REPRESENT TWO GENERATORS EACH PRODUCING CURRENT AT A POTENTIAL OF 110 VOLTS
THE LESSON HE THEN LEARNED WAS TO DEVOTE HIS INVENTIVE FACULTIES ONLY TO THINGS FOR WHICH THERE WAS A REAL GENUINE DEMAND AND THAT WOULD SUBSERVE THE ACTUAL NECESSITIES OF HUMANITY
THE HOTEL IS SITUATED AT AN ELEVATION OF THIRTY-FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND WAS AT THAT TIME FORTY MILES FROM THE RAILROAD
A LAMP SO CONSTRUCTED AND MADE BEFORE 1872 WAS WORTH A LARGE SUM OF MONEY TO THOSE INTERESTED IN DEFEATING THE EDISON PATENT LIKE THE AMERICAN COMPANY AND GOEBEL WAS NOT A RICH MAN
THE REFERENCE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE PRECEDING DIAGRAM AND ALL CONDITIONS ARE ALSO ALIKE EXCEPT THAT A CENTRAL COMPENSATING OR BALANCING CONDUCTOR PN IS HERE INTRODUCED
TURNING NOW TO OTHER IMPORTANT ARTS AND INDUSTRIES WHICH HAVE BEEN CREATED BY EDISON'S INVENTIONS AND IN WHICH HE IS AT THIS TIME TAKING AN ACTIVE PERSONAL INTEREST LET US VISIT ORANGE NEW JERSEY
THE MANAGER WOULD SEE HIM STUDYING SOMETIMES AN ARTICLE IN SUCH A PAPER AS THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN AND THEN DISAPPEARING TO BUY A FEW SUNDRIES FOR EXPERIMENTS
ONE OF THE MEN REFUSED IT BUT THE OTHER TOLD THE FIRST SPOKESMAN TO LET ME HAVE THEM
228,329 ISSUED JUNE 1 1880
THESE I WOULD TAKE HOME AND LAY AT THE FOOT OF MY BED
IN ENGLAND THE FIERCE FERVOR OF THE CHARTIST MOVEMENT WITH ITS VIOLENT RHETORIC AS TO THE RIGHTS OF MAN WAS SOBERING DOWN AND PASSING PERVASIVELY INTO NUMEROUS PRACTICAL SCHEMES FOR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL AMELIORATION CONSTITUTING IN THEIR ENTIRETY A MOST PROFOUND CHANGE THROUGHOUT EVERY PART OF THE NATIONAL LIFE
THE MERE FACT THAT EVEN WITH THE SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTION OF THE ELECTRIC LAMP THE ASSAULT ON THE COMPLETE PROBLEM OF COMMERCIAL LIGHTING WOULD HARDLY BE BEGUN DID NOT DETER HIM IN THE SLIGHTEST
IF ONE WERE TO ASK EDISON HE WOULD PROBABLY SAY HARD WORK NOT TOO MUCH SLEEP AND FREE USE OF THE IMAGINATION WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR THE AVERAGE MORTAL TO ARRIVE AT SUCH PERFECTION OF GUESSING BY FAITHFULLY FOLLOWING THIS FORMULA EVEN REINFORCED BY THE EDISON RECIPE FOR STIMULATING A SLOW IMAGINATION WITH PASTRY IS OPEN FOR DEMONSTRATION
I AM SATISFIED NOW
MILLIKEN READ IT AND A LOOK OF SURPRISE CAME OVER HIS COUNTENANCE AS HE ASKED ME IF HE COULD TAKE IT OFF THE LINE LIKE THAT
WHILE AT FOOT'S CRAY I MET SOME OF THE BACKERS OF FERRANTI THEN PUTTING UP A GIGANTIC ALTERNATING-CURRENT DYNAMO NEAR LONDON TO SEND TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND VOLTS UP INTO THE MAIN DISTRICT OF THE CITY FOR ELECTRIC LIGHTING
THAT OF THE EVOLUTION OF MOTION PICTURES FOLLOWS
ALL THROUGH 1881 JOHNSON WAS VERY BUSY FOR HIS PART IN ENGLAND
DURING THAT PERIOD HE WAS GRANTED ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-NINE OTHER PATENTS ON THE LAMP AND ITS MANUFACTURE
BUT NOW HE WAS A GREAT INVENTOR AND FAMOUS A WELCOME ADDITION TO THE BAND OF ASTRONOMERS AND PHYSICISTS ASSEMBLED TO OBSERVE THE ECLIPSE AND THE CORONA
HE WROTE BACK THAT IF I CAME ON IMMEDIATELY HE COULD GET ME IN THE WESTERN UNION OFFICE
HIS FACE WAS ALSO EXTREMELY IRREGULAR
IN 1879 AT THE BERLIN EXHIBITION THE DISTINGUISHED FIRM OF SIEMENS TO WHOSE INGENUITY AND ENTERPRISE ELECTRICAL DEVELOPMENT OWES SO MUCH INSTALLED A ROAD ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF A MILE IN LENGTH OVER WHICH THE LOCOMOTIVE HAULED A TRAIN OF THREE SMALL CARS AT A SPEED OF ABOUT EIGHT MILES AN HOUR CARRYING SOME TWENTY PERSONS EVERY TRIP
TO OTHERS THIS DIVERSION WAS BOTH MYSTERIOUS AND MEANINGLESS BUT HE HAD SOON BECOME FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE CHEMICALS OBTAINABLE AT THE LOCAL DRUG STORES AND HAD TESTED TO HIS SATISFACTION MANY OF THE STATEMENTS ENCOUNTERED IN HIS SCIENTIFIC READING
BUT IT DIDN'T
WITHIN ITS FIRST YEAR THE CAPITAL WAS AGAIN INCREASED TO $1,000,000 AND DIVIDENDS OF 10 PER CENT
IT WAS HARD WORK AND LONG HOURS BUT STILL THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT MADE LIFE PLEASANT
THEY HAD NO FAITH IN ELECTRIC LIGHTING AND REJECTED ALL OUR OVERTURES TO INDUCE THEM TO TAKE UP THE NEW BUSINESS OF MAKING ELECTRIC-LIGHT FIXTURES
AFTER HAVING GONE OVER THIS MATTER SEVERAL TIMES HE SAID
APRIL 11 1898 661,238 MACHINE FOR FORMING PULVERIZED MATERIAL IN BRIQUETTES APRIL 11 1898 674,057 CRUSHING ROLLS APRIL 11 1898 703,562 APPARATUS FOR BRICKING PULVERIZED MATERIAL APRIL 11 1898 704,010 APPARATUS FOR CONCENTRATING MAGNETIC IRON ORES
THE RAILS WERE INSULATED FROM THE TIES BY GIVING THEM TWO COATS OF JAPAN BAKING THEM IN THE OVEN AND THEN PLACING THEM ON PADS OF TAR-IMPREGNATED MUSLIN LAID ON THE TIES
MR EDISON REMARKS THE FACT THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TELEGRAPH OF THAT TIME AND OF TO-DAY EXCEPT THE GENERAL USE OF THE OLD MORSE REGISTER WITH THE DOTS AND DASHES RECORDED BY INDENTING PAPER STRIPS THAT COULD BE READ AND CHECKED LATER AT LEISURE IF NECESSARY

THE HOME POLE-CHANGER MAY DO LIKEWISE AND THE HOME TRANSMITTER MAY INCREASE AND DECREASE THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE OF THE HOME BATTERY REPEATEDLY
THE ONLY THING HE REQUIRED FOR THIS WAS THAT WHEN A MAN WAS SENT WITH A NOTE FROM HIM ASKING US TO GIVE HIM A JOB HE WAS TO BE PUT ON
772,647 ISSUED OCTOBER 18 1904 THERE IS NOTHING SURPRISING IN THIS HOWEVER AS THE POSSIBILITY OF PHOTOGRAPHING AND REPRODUCING ACTUAL SCENES OF ANIMATE LIFE ARE SO THOROUGHLY EXEMPLIFIED AND RENDERED PRACTICABLE BY THE APPARATUS AND METHODS DISCLOSED IN THE PATENTS ABOVE CITED THAT THESE BASIC INVENTIONS IN THEMSELVES PRACTICALLY CONSTITUTE THE ART--ITS DEVELOPMENT PROCEEDING MAINLY ALONG THE LINE OF MANUFACTURING DETAILS
HE TOLD ME I WOULD NEVER GET ANOTHER CENT BUT THAT HE KNEW A MAN WHO WOULD BUY IT
THE POSITION CARRIED A SALARY OF $25 PER MONTH
NO NEW CUSTOMERS WERE TO BE CONNECTED FROM TIME TO TIME TO THE MAINS AND NO REPAIRS WERE WITHIN CONTEMPLATION
BUT IF THE CARBON IS SQUEEZED TOGETHER THE CONDITIONS CHANGE WITH LESS RESISTANCE TO ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT
HERE THERE HAS BEEN PROVIDED A SOLID CONCRETE CELLAR FLOOR TECHNICALLY CALLED FOOTING THE MOLDS ARE THEN LOCKED TOGETHER SO THAT THEY REST ON THIS FOOTING
IN THIS WHICH WAS A NEW AND RADICAL INVENTION WE SEE THE FIRST STEP TOWARD THE MODERN INCANDESCENT LAMP
BUT BEFORE HE HAD COMPLETED ALL THE BUILDINGS AND PUT IN MACHINERY SOME COMPROMISE WAS MADE AND THE WORKS WERE FOR SALE
AND IT WAS SOON FOUND THAT THE ROSEATE DREAMS OF SUCCESS ENTERTAINED BY THE SANGUINE PROMOTERS WERE NOT TO BE REALIZED
THIS IN TURN BRINGS ANY DESIRED LETTERS OR FIGURES ON THE TYPE-WHEELS TO A CENTRAL POINT WHERE THEY MAY BE IMPRESSED UPON THE PAPER TAPE
THE APPARENT INTRICACY OF THE PROBLEM BEING SO GREAT THAT THE MEANS FOR ACCOMPLISHING THE DESIRED END WERE SEEMINGLY BEYOND THE GRASP OF THE IMAGINATION OR THE MASTERY OF INVENTION
MARCH 13 1908 944,481 PROCESSES AND APPARATUS FOR ARTIFICIALLY AGING OR SEASONING PORTLAND CEMENT
GREAT AS HAS BEEN THE GENIUS BROUGHT TO BEAR ON ELECTRICAL DEVELOPMENT THERE IS NO OTHER MAN TO WHOM SUCH A COMPREHENSIVE TRIBUTE COULD BE PAID
AT THE DISTANT END THESE SIGNALS ARE RECEIVED SOMETIMES ON AN INK-WRITING RECORDER AS DOTS AND DASHES OR EVEN AS TYPEWRITING LETTERS
BUT WHO OTHER THAN EDISON WOULD ASSUME THAT SUCH A DEVICE COULD BE MADE TO REPEAT THESE MOVEMENTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT THE RATE OF TWENTY TO FORTY PER SECOND
NO WONDER THEY SAT UP ALL NIGHT FIXING AND ADJUSTING IT SO AS TO GET BETTER AND BETTER RESULTS--RECITING AND SINGING TRYING EACH OTHER'S VOICES AND THEN LISTENING WITH INVOLUNTARY AWE AS THE WORDS CAME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN JUST AS LONG AS THEY WERE WILLING TO REVOLVE THE LITTLE CYLINDER WITH ITS DOTTED SPIRAL INDENTATIONS IN THE TINFOIL UNDER THE VIBRATING STYLUS OF THE REPRODUCING DIAPHRAGM
IN NOTING THESE VARIOUS OBJECTS OF INTEREST ONE MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THIS PART OF THE BUILDING IS PRIMARILY A LIBRARY IF INDEED THAT FACT DID NOT AT ONCE IMPRESS ITSELF BY A GLANCE AT THE WELL-FILLED UNGLAZED BOOK-SHELVES IN THE ALCOVES OF THE MAIN FLOOR
WHILE SMALL MOTORS IT IS OBSERVED CAN BE USED NIGHT OR DAY AND SMALL STEAM-ENGINES ARE INCONVENIENT
GOEBEL'S CLAIMS WERE NOT UNKNOWN TO THE EDISON COMPANY FOR AS FAR BACK AS 1882 THEY HAD BEEN OFFICIALLY BROUGHT TO ITS NOTICE COUPLED WITH AN OFFER OF SALE FOR A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS
ONCE IN A WHILE HE FELT IT HIS DUTY TO GO OVER THE GROUND WITH SCIENTIFIC VISITORS MANY OF WHOM WERE FROM ABROAD AND DISCUSS QUESTIONS WHICH WERE NOT SIMPLY THOSE OF TECHNIQUE BUT RELATED TO NEWER PHENOMENA SUCH AS THE ACTION OF CARBON THE NATURE AND EFFECTS OF HIGH VACUA
THE NEXT STEP TOWARD THE EVOLUTION OF THE IMPROVED PHONOGRAPH OF TO-DAY WAS ANOTHER FORM OF TIN-FOIL MACHINE AS SEEN IN THE ILLUSTRATION
BEING COVERED BY PATENT NO
A KEEN APPRECIATION OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS IN THE PRODUCTION OF A FINE QUALITY OF CEMENT LED EDISON TO PROVIDE VERY CAREFULLY IN HIS ORIGINAL SCHEME FOR THOSE DETAILS THAT HE FORESAW WOULD BECOME REQUISITE--SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS AMPLE STOCK CAPACITY FOR RAW MATERIALS AND THEIR AUTOMATIC DELIVERY IN THE VARIOUS STAGES OF MANUFACTURE AS WELL AS MIXING WEIGHING AND FREQUENT SAMPLING AND ANALYZING DURING THE PROGRESS THROUGH THE MILLS
ACHESON FORMERLY ONE OF HIS STAFF
FOR THIS PURPOSE THERE ARE PROVIDED AT D AND E A CONTACT AND A BACK STOP THE FORMER OF WHICH IS OPENED AND CLOSED BY THE SWINGING PERMANENT MAGNET THUS OPENING AND CLOSING THE LOCAL CIRCUIT
WHY DOESN'T HE TRY IT AND SEE MR E
ACCORDINGLY A NEW AND DISTINCT CORPORATION WAS FORMED CALLED THE EDISON COMPANY FOR ISOLATED LIGHTING TO WHICH WAS ISSUED A SPECIAL LICENSE TO SELL AND OPERATE PLANTS OF A SELF-CONTAINED CHARACTER
I CAN ONLY ACCOUNT FOR IT BY HIS REMARKABLE INSIGHT AND WONDERFUL NATURAL SENSE OF THE PROPORTION OF THINGS IN ADDITION TO WHICH HE SEEMS TO CARRY IN HIS HEAD DETERMINING FACTORS OF ALL KINDS AND HAS THE ABILITY TO APPLY THEM INSTANTLY IN CONSIDERING ANY MECHANICAL PROBLEM WHILE THIS MYSTERIOUS INTUITIVE POWER HAS BEEN OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE IN CONNECTION WITH THE VAST NUMBER OF TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO HIS LIFE-WORK THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REMARKABLE INSTANCES IN WHICH IT HAS SEEMED LITTLE LESS THAN PROPHECY AND IT IS DEEMED WORTH WHILE TO DIGRESS TO THE EXTENT OF RELATING TWO OF THEM
BUT THAT IS ALL
A BUILDING WAS RENTED ON WASHINGTON STREET WHERE MACHINERY AND TOOLS WERE PUT IN SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR MAKING THE UNDERGROUND TUBE CONDUCTORS AND THEIR VARIOUS PARAPHERNALIA
OBVIOUSLY AT EACH STEP THE PERCENTAGE OF FELSPAR AND PHOSPHORUS IS LESS AND LESS UNTIL IN THE FINAL CONCENTRATES THE PERCENTAGE OF IRON OXIDE IS 91 TO 93 PER CENT
THEIR PRICE IS STILL VERY HIGH HOWEVER AS COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE CARBON LAMP WHICH HAS BEEN VASTLY IMPROVED IN METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION AND WHOSE AVERAGE PRICE OF FIFTEEN CENTS IS ONLY ONE-TENTH OF WHAT IT WAS WHEN EDISON FIRST BROUGHT IT OUT
BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER THAT RELATE TO INVENTIONS ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL AND ORIGINAL IN THEIR NATURE
FLATTERED BY THEIR SUCCESS MESSRS
IT MIGHT THEREFORE BE NATURAL TO ASK HOW FAR EDISON OR HIS COMPANIES HAVE BENEFITED PECUNIARILY BY REASON OF THE MANY BELATED VICTORIES THEY HAVE SCORED IN THE COURTS
SOON AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BIG DYNAMO MACHINE THE LANDLORD APPEARED IN THE SHOP AND INSISTED THAT BERGMANN WAS USING MORE POWER THAN HE WAS PAYING FOR AND SAID THAT LATELY THE BELT ON THE ENGINE WAS SLIPPING AND SQUEALING

I THINK HE MUST HAVE LIVED AMONG A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE VERY SOLEMN BECAUSE I WENT OUT RIDING WITH HIM IN THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE AND STARTED IN TO TELL HIM AMERICAN STORIES
WHEN I WAS RUNNING MY ORE-MINE HE SAYS AND GOT UP TO THE POINT OF MAKING SHIPMENTS TO JOHN FRITZ I DIDN'T HAVE CAPITAL ENOUGH TO CARRY THE ORE SO I WENT TO J
IT WILL BE OBVIOUS THEREFORE THAT AS THE ROLLERS ARE SET SO AS TO ALLOW OF CURRENTS OF OPPOSITE POLARITY TO BE ALTERNATELY AND RAPIDLY SENT BY MEANS OF THE PERFORATIONS THE MARKS UPON THE TAPE AT THE RECEIVING STATION WILL OCCUPY THEIR PROPER RELATIVE POSITIONS AND THE AGGREGATE RESULT WILL BE LETTERS CORRESPONDING TO THOSE PERFORATED IN THE TRANSMISSION TAPE

BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY HE CERTAINLY SHOWED INGENUITY AND RESOURCE IN APPLYING SUCH A METHOD TO MEET THE NECESSITY
THIS CYLINDER WAS MOUNTED ON A SHAFT SUPPORTED ON TWO STANDARDS

AT MIDNIGHT WE HAD LUNCH BROUGHT IN AND SERVED AT A LONG TABLE AT WHICH THE EXPERIMENTERS SAT DOWN
FIELD TO THE LATTER OF WHOM THE PRACTICAL WORK OF ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT WAS CONFIDED AND IN JUNE OF THE SAME YEAR AN EXHIBIT WAS MADE AT THE CHICAGO RAILWAY EXPOSITION WHICH ATTRACTED ATTENTION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND DID MUCH TO STIMULATE THE GROWING INTEREST IN ELECTRIC-RAILWAY WORK
THE ADVENTURES OF MR MCGOWAN AFTER LEAVING IQUITOS WOULD FILL A BOOK IF RELATED IN DETAIL
SOME OF THE RESIDENTS ARE ENGAGED IN LOCAL BUSINESS
IN DESCRIBING HIS ENTERPRISING ACTION THAT DAY EDISON SAYS THAT WHEN HE REACHED DETROIT THE BULLETIN-BOARDS OF THE NEWSPAPER OFFICES WERE SURROUNDED WITH DENSE CROWDS WHICH READ AWESTRICKEN THE NEWS THAT THERE WERE 60,000 KILLED AND WOUNDED AND THAT THE RESULT WAS UNCERTAIN
TO THOSE WHO LIKE THE AUTHORS HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF EXAMINING THE VOLUMINOUS RECORDS WHICH SHOW THE FLIGHTS OF HIS IMAGINATION THERE COMES A FEELING OF UTTER INADEQUACY TO CONVEY TO OTHERS THE FULL EXTENT OF THE STORY THEY REVEAL
THE COURSE OF ELECTRICAL HISTORY HAS BEEN VARIEGATED BY SOME VERY REMARKABLE LITIGATION
ONE TEASPOONFUL OF THAT STUFF WOULD PUT ME TO SLEEP MR EDISON THROWS ALSO A CURIOUS SIDE-LIGHT ON THE ORIGIN OF THE COMIC COLUMN IN THE MODERN AMERICAN NEWSPAPER THE TELEGRAPH GIVING TO A NEW JOKE OR A GOOD STORY THE UBIQUITY AND INSTANTANEITY OF AN IMPORTANT HISTORICAL EVENT
HE WAS BADLY HURT AND BRUISED AND NO SMALL QUANTITY OF ARNICA WAS NEEDED FOR HIS WOUNDS
AS A MATTER OF FACT CURRENT FLOWS OVER BOTH CIRCUITS AS THE CYLINDER IS ROTATED BUT THE PRESS-MAGNET IS PURPOSELY MADE TO BE COMPARATIVELY SLUGGISH AND THE NARROWNESS OF THE SEGMENTS ON WHEEL W TENDS TO DIMINISH THE FLOW OF CURRENT IN THE PRESS CIRCUIT UNTIL THE CYLINDER COMES TO REST WHEN THE CURRENT CONTINUOUSLY FLOWS OVER THAT CIRCUIT WITHOUT INTERRUPTION AND FULLY ENERGIZES THE PRESS-MAGNET
THERE WERE ARCHES ETC
SUCH EVIDENCE IS TO BE RECEIVED WITH GREAT CAUTION AND THE PRESUMPTION OF NOVELTY ARISING FROM THE GRANT OF THE PATENT IS NOT TO BE OVERCOME EXCEPT UPON CLEAR AND CONVINCING PROOF
EDISON BY COUNTLESS EXPERIMENTS SUCCEEDED IN ADVANCING THE ART
THE COPYING FROM A SINGLE MASTER OF MANY MILLIONS OF EXCESSIVELY MINUTE SOUND-WAVES HAVING A MAXIMUM WIDTH OF ONE HUNDREDTH OF AN INCH AND A MAXIMUM DEPTH OF ONE THOUSANDTH OF AN INCH OR LESS THAN THE THICKNESS OF A SHEET OF TISSUE-PAPER
THESE QUALITIES TOGETHER WITH HIS PERSISTENCE AND PERSEVERANCE AND FACULTY OF INTELLIGENT DISCRIMINATION IN THE MATTER OF FIBRES HELPED TO MAKE HIS MISSION SUCCESSFUL AND GAVE TO HIM THE HONOR OF BEING THE ONE WHO FOUND THE BAMBOO WHICH WAS ADOPTED FOR USE AS FILAMENTS IN COMMERCIAL EDISON LAMPS
AT THE RECEIVING END THE TAPE WAS TAKEN BY OTHER CLERKS WHO TRANSLATED THE MORSE CHARACTERS INTO ORDINARY WORDS WHICH WERE WRITTEN ON MESSAGE BLANKS FOR DELIVERY TO PERSONS FOR WHOM THE MESSAGES WERE INTENDED
THE DAILY NEWSPAPERS AND TECHNICAL JOURNALS LOST NO TIME IN BRINGING THE ROAD TO PUBLIC ATTENTION AND THE NEW YORK HERALD OF JUNE 25TH WAS SWIFT TO SUGGEST THAT HERE WAS THE LOCOMOTIVE THAT WOULD BE MOST PLEASING TO THE AVERAGE NEW YORKER WHOSE HEAD HAS ACHED WITH NOISE WHOSE EYES HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH DUST OR WHOSE CLOTHES HAVE BEEN RUINED WITH OIL A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THE DAILY GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATED AND DESCRIBED THE ROAD AND PUBLISHED A SKETCH OF A ONE-HUNDRED-HORSE-POWER ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE FOR THE USE OF THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD BETWEEN PERTH AMBOY AND RAHWAY
THROUGH ALL THIS VAST AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THERE HAD BEEN NO PREVIOUS SIGNS OF THE ELECTRICAL ACTION HE WAS LOOKING FOR
IT INVOLVED MECHANICAL COMPLICATIONS THAT SEEMED TO BE INSURMOUNTABLE AND UP TO THE TIME EDISON INVENTED HIS PERFORATING MACHINE NO REALLY GOOD METHOD WAS AVAILABLE
AFTER A WHILE THERE WAS A DAILY IMMIGRANT TRAIN PUT ON
UNTIL I GET AT THE PROPER METHOD OF POURING AND GETTING RID OF THE AIR-BUBBLES IT WILL BE WASTE OF TIME TO EXPERIMENT WITH OTHER ASPHALTS
THIS POINT I FAILED TO NOTICE
TWO OR THREE OF THE DEVICES WERE MADE AND TESTED BY THE COMPANY'S EXPERT
IF THE RIGHT THUS GRANTED IS INVADED APPLY TO A FEDERAL COURT AND THE INFRINGER WILL BE ENJOINED AND REQUIRED TO SETTLE IN DAMAGES FAIR AND FALSE PROMISE
THE DECISIONS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE FALLEN WIDE OF THE MARK
THE PRACTICAL RESULTS ARE TOO WELL KNOWN TO CALL FOR FURTHER COMMENT
SHE WOULD NOT LIVE OVER A BOILER
THE REASON FOR THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN DETERMINED
HUGHES WHO WENT WITH EDISON IN 1879 AND WAS IN CHARGE OF MUCH OF THE WORK STATES THAT THEY WERE SECOND STREET-CAR RAILS INSULATED WITH TAR CANVAS PAPER AND THINGS OF THAT SORT--"ASPHALT THEY WERE SPIKED DOWN ON ORDINARY SLEEPERS LAID UPON THE NATURAL GRADE AND THE GAUGE WAS ABOUT THREE FEET SIX INCHES
AT THE END OF THAT TIME THE LAMP-HOURS WERE TO BE ADDED TOGETHER BY ONE OF THE CLERKS AND FIGURED ON A BASIS OF A DEFINITE AMOUNT PER LAMP-HOUR AND COMPARED WITH THE BILL THAT WOULD BE RENDERED BY THE STATION FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD
I WELL REMEMBER THE ASTONISHMENT OF DOCTOR PARKER AND HIS ASSOCIATES WHEN THEY NOTED THE DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERATURE AS COMPARED WITH GAS
AND ROBERT J
I FELL A VICTIM TO THE SPELL AT THE FIRST INTERVIEW EVENTS MOVED RAPIDLY IN THOSE DAYS
A NIGHT SCHOOL WAS THEREFORE FOUNDED AT FIFTH AVENUE AND WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF MR E
NEXT WOULD COME INVENTORS WHOSE VALUE TO THE WORLD AS AN ASSET COULD BE READILY ESTIMATED FROM AN INCREASE OF ITS WEALTH RESULTING FROM THE ACTUAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF THESE RESOURCES INTO ITEMS OF CONVENIENCE AND COMFORT THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF THEIR INVENTIVE INGENUITY
YOU ARE PUTTING DOWN THESE TUBES
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SERVICES WHICH MR LOWREY HAS EVER PERFORMED WAS IN FURNISHING AND PROCURING THE NECESSARY FINANCIAL BACKING FOR THOMAS A
IT WAS AT THIS JUNCTURE THAT EDISON REACHED NEW YORK AND ACCORDING TO HIS OWN STATEMENT FOUND SHELTER AT NIGHT IN THE BATTERY-ROOM OF THE GOLD INDICATOR COMPANY HAVING MEANTIME APPLIED FOR A POSITION AS OPERATOR WITH THE WESTERN UNION
EDISON TOLD ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH A PAINFUL SENSE OF BEING IN SOME WAY IMPLICATED
10 1889 430,276 PHONOGRAPH JAN
THE WANDERINGS LED TO THE OLD ORE-MILLING PLANT AT EDISON NOW PRACTICALLY A MASS OF DESERTED BUILDINGS ALL GOING TO DECAY
THROUGH THESE INVENTIONS THERE CAME INTO BEING AN ENTIRELY NEW ART COMPLETE IN ITS PRACTICABILITY EVOLVED BY EDISON AFTER PROTRACTED EXPERIMENTS FOUNDED UPON MOST PATIENT THOROUGH AND ORIGINAL METHODS OF INVESTIGATION EXTENDING OVER SEVERAL YEARS
NOW HOWEVER AFTER THESE MANY MONTHS OF ARDUOUS TOIL IN WHICH HE HAD EXAMINED AND TESTED PRACTICALLY ALL THE KNOWN ELEMENTS IN NUMEROUS CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS THE ELECTRIC ACTION HE SOUGHT FOR HAD BEEN OBTAINED THUS AFFORDING HIM THE FIRST INKLING OF THE SECRET THAT HE HAD INDUSTRIOUSLY TRIED TO WREST FROM NATURE
THE VOLUME OF SOUND WAS VERY GREAT
ONE OF THE GREAT CASES IN WHICH HE THUS TOOK A LEADING AND DISTINGUISHED PART WAS THAT OF THE QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPH
IT WAS ONLY AS ONE MIGHT STAND IN THEIR VICINITY AND HEAR THE THUNDEROUS ROAR ACCOMPANYING THE SMASHING AND RENDING OF THE MASSIVE ROCKS AS THEY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW THAT THE MIND WAS OVERWHELMED WITH A SENSE OF THE MAGNIFICENT PROPORTIONS OF THIS OPERATION
FREQUENTLY LARGE BODIES OF MEN ARE USED IN PICTURES SUCH AS TROOPS OF SOLDIERS AND IT IS AN OPEN SECRET THAT FOR WEEKS DURING THE BOER WAR REGULARLY EQUIPPED BRITISH AND BOER ARMIES CONFRONTED EACH OTHER ON THE PEACEFUL HILLS OF ORANGE NEW JERSEY READY TO ENACT BEFORE THE CAMERA THE STIRRING EVENTS TOLD BY THE CABLE FROM THE SEAT OF HOSTILITIES
WHILE THE FIRST MOTION PICTURE WAS NOT ACTUALLY PRODUCED UNTIL THE SUMMER OF 1889 ITS REAL BIRTH WAS ALMOST A CENTURY EARLIER WHEN PLATEAU IN FRANCE CONSTRUCTED AN OPTICAL TOY TO WHICH THE IMPRESSIVE NAME OF PHENAKISTOSCOPE WAS APPLIED FOR PRODUCING AN ILLUSION OF MOTION
ON THE THIRD DAY OF MY ARRIVAL AND WHILE SITTING IN THE OFFICE THE COMPLICATED GENERAL INSTRUMENT FOR SENDING ON ALL THE LINES AND WHICH MADE A VERY GREAT NOISE SUDDENLY CAME TO A STOP WITH A CRASH
HE CULTIVATED THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MR SOMMERS SUPERINTENDENT OF TELEGRAPH OF THE CINCINNATI INDIANAPOLIS RAILROAD WHO GAVE HIM PERMISSION TO TAKE SUCH SCRAP APPARATUS AS HE MIGHT DESIRE THAT WAS OF NO USE TO THE COMPANY
AS REGARDS LOSS DUE TO RESISTANCE THERE IS A WELL-KNOWN LAW FOR DETERMINING IT BASED ON OHM'S LAW
AT THE TIME WE WERE PROMOTING AND PUTTING UP ELECTRIC-LIGHT STATIONS IN PENNSYLVANIA NEW YORK AND NEW ENGLAND THERE WOULD BE DELEGATIONS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO PROPOSED TO PAY FOR THESE STATIONS
ONCE AGAIN HE WENT TO THE CUSTOMER'S METER TO LOOK AROUND WHEN A SMALL PIECE OF THICK WIRE ON THE FLOOR CAUGHT HIS EYE
THESE EXPERIMENTS AND MANY OTHERS WERE TRIED IN A GREAT VARIETY OF WAYS UNTIL AS THE RESULT OF ALL THIS WORK EDISON ARRIVED AT THE PRINCIPLE WHICH HAS REMAINED IN THE ART TO THIS DAY
HE DROPPED OUT OF THE BUSINESS AT THE TIME OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE THOMSON-HOUSTON COMPANY WITH THE EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY
BUT IT WILL PROBABLY SURPRISE MANY PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT HE WAS THE INVENTOR OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR BEFORE HE PERFECTED HIS INCANDESCENT LAMP
ALVA BRADLEY AN OLD FRIEND OF HIS FATHER AND A CELEBRATED SHIP-OWNER ON THE LAKES
STOREY WHO SUBSEQUENTLY FOUNDED THE CHICAGO TIMES AND BECAME CELEBRATED IN THE NEWSPAPER WORLD
SO I WENT DOWN TO QUOGUE WITH ONE OF MY ASSISTANTS AND SAW THERE FOR MILES LARGE BEDS OF BLACK SAND ON THE BEACH IN LAYERS FROM ONE TO SIX INCHES THICK--HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TONS
THEN SUDDENLY POINTING TO A WEATHER-VANE ON THE FREIGHT DEPOT HE PULLED OUT A COLT REVOLVER AND FIRED THROUGH THE WINDOW HITTING THE VANE
THE ABOVE EXTRACTS ARE GOOD ILLUSTRATIONS HOWEVER OF SCIENTIFIC OPINIONS UP TO THE END OF 1879 WHEN MR EDISON'S EPOCH-MAKING INVENTION RENDERED THEM ENTIRELY UNTENABLE

NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN IN DIRER POVERTY THAN HE WHEN THE STEAMBOAT LANDED HIM IN NEW YORK IN 1869
HE PUT THIS JUMPER SLYLY IN CONTACT WITH THE WIRES--AND JUST FOUR LAMPS WENT OUT ON THE SECTION HE TAMPERED WITH
JOHN ELLIOTT A BAPTIST MINISTER AND DESCENDANT OF AN OLD REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIER CAPT
ANDREWS SKIPPED FROM UNDER
SO THAT THE REAL PURCHASE PRICE WAS NOT LESS THAN $1,000,000 IN CASH
HIS BUSINESS ABILITY WAS ON A HIGH LEVEL WHILE HIS PERSONAL CHARACTER ENDEARED HIM TO US ALL AMONG OTHER NOW WELL-KNOWN MEN WHO CAME TO US AND ASSISTED IN VARIOUS KINDS OF WORK WERE MESSRS
AND THE RESULTS WERE THEN PLACED ON THE MAP
IN THE END HOWEVER THE COMPLAINANT HAD NOTHING TO SHOW FOR ALL HIS STRUGGLE AS THE MASTER WHO MADE THE ACCOUNTING SET THE DAMAGES AT ONE DOLLAR
VERY SOON AFTER HE HAD DECIDED UPON THE USE OF NICKEL AND IRON AS THE ELEMENTAL METALS FOR HIS STORAGE BATTERY EDISON ESTABLISHED A CHEMICAL PLANT AT SILVER LAKE NEW JERSEY A FEW MILES FROM THE ORANGE LABORATORY ON LAND PURCHASED SOME TIME PREVIOUSLY
IN ADDITION TO THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF MONEY INVOLVED THIS SPECIALIZED INDUSTRY REQUIRED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF EXPERIMENT AS IT CALLED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENTIRELY NEW ART
ONLY TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO A FLATTERING INVITATION CAME FROM ONE OF THE GREAT ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES TO RECEIVE A DEGREE BUT AT THAT MOMENT HE WAS DEEP IN EXPERIMENTS ON HIS NEW STORAGE BATTERY AND NOTHING COULD BUDGE HIM
INSTEAD OF THE TWO SMALL CONTACT WHEELS HOWEVER A PROJECTING ARM CARRIED AN IRON PIN OR STYLUS SO ARRANGED THAT ITS POINT WOULD NORMALLY IMPINGE UPON THE PERIPHERY OF THE DRUM
IF ANOTHER BATTERY D BE INTRODUCED AT THE DISTANT END OF THE WIRE A THE DIFFERENTIAL OR NEUTRAL RELAY BECOMES ACTIVELY OPERATIVE AS FOLLOWS
FOURTH--TO ELABORATE A SYSTEM OR NETWORK OF CONDUCTORS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED UNDERGROUND OR OVERHEAD WHICH WOULD ALLOW OF BEING TAPPED AT ANY INTERVALS SO THAT SERVICE WIRES COULD BE RUN FROM THE MAIN CONDUCTORS IN THE STREET INTO EACH BUILDING
EVERYBODY WAS ASTONISHED
EQUALLY WELL REMEMBERED IS A DANGEROUS ENCOUNTER WITH A RAM THAT ATTACKED HIM WHILE HE WAS BUSILY ENGAGED DIGGING OUT A BUMBLEBEE'S NEST NEAR AN ORCHARD FENCE
SOON AFTER THE STATION WENT INTO OPERATION THIS INGENIOUS PLAN WAS CHANGED AND THE THIRD DYNAMO WAS REPLACED BY TWO OTHERS
EDISON WAS SENT TO ENGLAND TO MAKE THE DEMONSTRATION IN 1873 REPORTING THERE TO COL
EDISON HAD PERFECT CONFIDENCE IN HIS METERS AND ALSO IN THE ULTIMATE JUDGMENT OF THE PUBLIC AS TO THE SUPERIORITY OF THE INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHT AS AGAINST OTHER ILLUMINANTS
I HADN'T GONE TWENTY MILES BEFORE BLACK DAMP MUD BLEW OUT OF THE STACK AND COVERED EVERY PART OF THE ENGINE INCLUDING MYSELF
THESE MEN ALL HAD COMPLETE FAITH IN HIS ABILITY AND STOOD BY HIM AS ON A ROCK GUARDING THEIR WORK WITH THE SECRETIVENESS OF A BURGLAR-PROOF SAFE
WHILE ALL THIS STUDY OF A POSSIBLE LAMP WAS GOING ON MR UPTON WAS BUSY CALCULATING THE ECONOMY OF THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM AND MAKING A GREAT MANY TABLES TO DETERMINE WHAT RESISTANCE A LAMP SHOULD HAVE FOR THE BEST RESULTS AND AT WHAT POINT THE PROPOSED GENERAL SYSTEM WOULD FALL OFF IN ECONOMY WHEN THE LAMPS WERE OF THE LOWER RESISTANCE THAT WAS THEN GENERALLY ASSUMED TO BE NECESSARY
WON'T YOU LOOK NO HE WOULDN'T LOOK
A GREAT VARIETY WAS FOUND AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED BOXES OF SPECIMENS WERE SHIPPED TO THE LABORATORY FROM TIME TO TIME BUT NONE OF THEM TESTED OUT WITH ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY RESULTS
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ADVERTISEMENT ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE TELEGRAPHER AND APPEARING FREQUENTLY WAS NOT PAID FOR AT FULL RATES AS THE PUBLISHER MR J
VARIOUS REASONS MAY BE CITED SUCH AS THE GROWING SCARCITY OF WOOD ONCE THE FAVORITE BUILDING MATERIAL IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THE INCREASING DEARNESS OF BRICK AND STONE
IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED HOWEVER THAT THE EDISON TUBE SYSTEM HAD THEN REACHED A FINALITY OF PERFECTION IN THE EYES OF ITS INVENTOR
AND A CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF THE EDISON INSTALLATIONS
THE INSTRUMENT IN ITS COMMERCIAL FORM IS SHOWN IN FIG
TO SAY THAT THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM LAY MERELY IN REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE CARBON BURNER TO A MERE HAIR IS TO STATE A HALF-TRUTH ONLY
HEAR ALL THE NECESSARY ARGUMENTS AND ACTUALLY DECIDE AN ORDINARY PATENT SUIT IN A WAY THAT WOULD MORE NEARLY BE JUST THAN CAN NOW BE DONE AT AN EXPENDITURE OF A HUNDRED TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AND MONTHS AND YEARS OF PREPARATION
THE MECHANISM OF SUCH A CAMERA AS NOW USED CONSISTS OF MANY PARTS ASSEMBLED IN SUCH CONTIGUOUS PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER THAT AN ILLUSTRATION FROM AN ACTUAL MACHINE WOULD NOT HELP TO CLEARNESS OF EXPLANATION TO THE GENERAL READER
BECAUSE SAID THE EMPEROR I NEVER ALLOW IT TO RISE ABOVE THIS LINE DRAWING HIS HAND ACROSS HIS THROAT
THE INCREASING ENDEAVORS OF INFRINGERS TO DIVERT INTO THEIR OWN POCKETS SOME OF THE PROCEEDS ARISING FROM THE MARKETING OF THE DEVICES COVERED BY EDISON'S INVENTIONS ON THESE LATTER LINES NECESSITATED THE INSTITUTION BY HIM SOME YEARS AGO OF A LEGAL DEPARTMENT WHICH AS IN THE CASE OF THE LIGHT INVENTIONS WAS DESIGNED TO CONSOLIDATE ALL LAW AND EXPERT WORK AND PLACE IT UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF A GENERAL COUNSEL
WE HAD THE LAMPS EXHIBITED IN A LARGE ROOM AND SO ARRANGED ON A TABLE AS TO ILLUSTRATE THE REGULAR LAYOUT OF CIRCUITS FOR HOUSES AND STREETS
THE BATTERY AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY PUT OUT SOME YEARS AGO MADE FOR ITSELF AN ENVIABLE REPUTATION
TO NOTHING DOES HE CLING MORE TENACIOUSLY THAN TO HIS DEVICES FOR FURNISHING LIGHT
JUST ABOUT THAT TIME EDISON MADE A TRIP TO CANADA AND WHEN HE CAME BACK WE HAD MADE SUCH GOOD PROGRESS THAT THE FIGURES HAD CREPT UP TO ABOUT 1000
EDISON HAS SAID THAT SOMETIMES HE HAS WONDERED HOW IT WAS HE DID NOT BECOME AN ANALYTICAL CHEMIST INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATING ON ELECTRICITY FOR WHICH HE HAD AT FIRST NO GREAT INCLINATION
I RECITED MARY ETC AND ANOTHER DITTY
THE MOMENT MR ORTON HEARD THIS HE SENT FOR ME AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AND WANTED ME TO GO TO WORK IMMEDIATELY AND SEE IF I COULDN'T EVADE IT OR DISCOVER SOME OTHER MEANS THAT COULD BE USED IN CASE GOULD SUSTAINED THE PATENT
PLATINUM EVEN IN THOSE DAYS WAS VERY EXPENSIVE COSTING SEVERAL DOLLARS AN OUNCE AND I OWNED ONLY THREE SMALL STRIPS
IN PRACTICE HOWEVER NO SUCH PERFECT CONDITIONS CAN OBTAIN HENCE THE NECESSITY OF THE PROVISION FOR BALANCING IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE PRINCIPLE OF INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF EACH UNIT
BUT THE WORK IS DONE BY THE GREAT MOMENTUM AND KINETIC ENERGY OBTAINED BY SPEEDING UP THESE TREMENDOUS MASSES OF METAL AND THEN SUDDENLY OPPOSING THEIR PROGRESS THE ENGINE BEING RELIEVED OF ALL STRAIN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE SLIPPING FRICTION-CLUTCHES
WITH HIS HEAD TURNED DOWNWARD AND THAT CONSPICUOUS LOCK OF HAIR HANGING LOOSELY ON ONE SIDE HE LOOKED LIKE NAPOLEON IN THE CELEBRATED PICTURE ON THE EVE OF A GREAT BATTLE
WITH THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THE TELEPHONE THE PREDICTION INCLUDED NOT ONLY THE RESULT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BUT IN A ROUGH AND GENERAL WAY THE MECHANISM ITSELF
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO APPRECIATE THE ENORMOUS DIFFICULTIES THAT HAVE BEEN OVERCOME FROM A BEGINNING WHICH WAS MADE PRACTICALLY IN THE DARK IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HAD COMPLETED MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND EXPERIMENTS THAT HE OBTAINED ANY POSITIVE PRELIMINARY RESULTS WHATEVER
THIS IS A FITTING STAGE AT WHICH TO REVIEW BRIEFLY WHAT HAD BEEN DONE IN ELECTRIC TRACTION UP TO THAT DATE
IT MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN ALTOGETHER BETTER FOR EDISON FROM THE FINANCIAL STANDPOINT IF HE HAD NOT IDENTIFIED HIMSELF SO COMPLETELY WITH ONE KIND OF CURRENT BUT THAT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM AS IT WAS A MATTER OF CONVICTION
THE VOICE INSTEAD OF FURNISHING ALL THE POWER AS WITH THE PRESENT RECEIVER MERELY CONTROLLED THE POWER JUST AS AN ENGINEER WORKING A VALVE WOULD CONTROL A POWERFUL ENGINE
SCHEFFLER WHO DESIGNED THE PASSENGER LOCOMOTIVE FOR THE 1882 ROAD THROW AN INTERESTING LIGHT ON ITS TECHNICAL DETAILS
BUT EDISON FORESAW THE SITUATION AND WARNED AGAINST IT LONG AGO
HE TURNED ME DOWN AND WOULD NOT DO IT
A SERIES OF THREE-INCH HOLES TWENTY FEET DEEP WERE DRILLED EIGHT FEET APART ABOUT TWELVE FEET BACK OF THE ORE-BANK AND INTO THESE WERE INSERTED DYNAMITE CARTRIDGES
THE INDICATOR WAS COMPOSED OF SEVERAL WHEELS
THIS WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE IF THE IRON COULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE SAND
BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT NO DISCOVERY OF ANY REAL VALUE IS EVER ENTIRELY LOST
I TOLD HIM IF THAT WAS THE CASE HE WOULD HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL AROUND THE LABORATORY
OTHER TESTS FOLLOWED IN DUE COURSE
THIS TIME THE CARBON STRIP BURNED AT INCANDESCENCE FOR ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES
IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT THE DEEPEST CUT OF THE RECORDING TOOL IS ONLY ABOUT ONE-THIRD THE THICKNESS OF TISSUE-PAPER
MR KRUESI WAS THE SUPERINTENDENT A SWISS TRAINED IN THE BEST SWISS IDEAS OF ACCURACY
EDISON HAS ALWAYS MANIFESTED A STRONG OBJECTION TO OVERHEAD WIRES IN CITIES AND URGED PLACING THEM UNDERGROUND
BY REASON OF THE EXPERIENCE GAINED AT THIS STATION THROUGH THE USE OF THESE CRUDE PLUG-SWITCHES MR EDISON STARTED A COMPETITION AMONG A FEW OF HIS ASSISTANTS TO DEVISE SOMETHING BETTER
IN PRACTICE THE NUMEROUS HOPPERS MAGNETS AND BINS WERE MANY FEET IN LENGTH
ONE NIGHT AFTER RECEIVING A SATISFACTORY REPORT OF PROGRESS FROM MR MASON SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CEMENT PLANT HE SAID
TITLE OF PATENT DATE EXECUTED DATE EXECUTED 90,646 ELECTROGRAPHIC VOTE RECORDER OCT
AND I HAD TO WORK OUT THE PROBLEM ENTIRELY AS I COULD FIND NO PRIOR SOLUTION
IT READS AS FOLLOWS
DISCLOSE YOUR INVENTION TO US IN A PATENT SO THAT WE MAY KNOW HOW TO PRACTICE IT AND WE WILL AGREE TO GIVE YOU A MONOPOLY FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AFTER WHICH WE SHALL BE FREE TO USE IT
AFTER HAVING DEVOTED SEVERAL MONTHS TO EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS OF CARBON AT THE END OF 1878 AS ALREADY DETAILED HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE PLATINUM GROUP OF METALS AND BEGAN A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH HE USED CHIEFLY PLATINUM WIRE AND IRIDIUM WIRE AND ALLOYS OF REFRACTORY METALS IN THE FORM OF WIRE BURNERS FOR INCANDESCENT LAMPS
I HAD AN OUNCE OF THE SULPHATE
THEY DESERVE IT AND BESIDES IT COSTS NO MORE AFTER THE PATTERN IS MADE TO GIVE DECORATIVE EFFECTS THAN IT WOULD TO MAKE EVERYTHING PLAIN THE PLANS HAVE PROVIDED FOR A TYPE OF HOUSE THAT WOULD COST NOT FAR FROM $30,000 IF BUILT OF CUT STONE
THE BELL COMPANY OF BOSTON ALSO STARTED AN EXCHANGE AND THE FIGHT WAS ON THE WESTERN UNION PIRATING THE BELL RECEIVER AND THE BOSTON COMPANY PIRATING THE WESTERN UNION TRANSMITTER
SOME OF THEM WERE CONSPICUOUS FOR THEIR SKILL AND VERSATILITY
NONE OF THE OTHER LAMPS IS AFFECTED THEREBY BUT THE SYSTEM IS IMMEDIATELY THROWN OUT OF BALANCE AND ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE IS AN EXCESS OF CURRENT TO THIS EXTENT WHICH FLOWS ALONG OR THROUGH THE CENTRAL CONDUCTOR AND RETURNS TO THE GENERATOR THE CENTRAL CONDUCTOR THUS BECOMING THE NEGATIVE OF THAT SIDE OF THE SYSTEM FOR THE TIME BEING
AT THE STATION AT MILAN ITALY THE FIRST JUMBOS OPERATED IN MULTIPLE ARC WERE DRIVEN BY PORTER-ALLEN ENGINES AND DASH-POTS WERE APPLIED TO THE GOVERNORS
I OBVIATED THIS BY USING SEVERAL RELAYS EACH WITH A DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENT WORKING SEVERAL SOUNDERS ALL CONNECTED WITH ONE SOUNDING-PLATE
ABOUT 9 O'CLOCK THE SUPERINTENDENT HANDED ME A DESPATCH WHICH HE SAID WAS VERY IMPORTANT AND WHICH I MUST GET OFF AT ONCE
I KNEW THAT IF THE SAME EXCITEMENT WAS ATTAINED AT THE VARIOUS SMALL TOWNS ALONG THE ROAD AND ESPECIALLY AT PORT HURON THE SALE OF PAPERS WOULD BE GREAT
IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THAT WITH MATTER RECEIVED AT A RATE OF FORTY WORDS PER MINUTE AND WORKED OFF AT TWENTY-FIVE WORDS PER MINUTE A SERIOUS CONGESTION OR DELAY WOULD RESULT AND THE NEWSPAPERS WERE MORE ANXIOUS FOR THE NEWS THAN THEY WERE FOR FINE PENMANSHIP
EDISON'S OWN ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT IS VERY LAUGHABLE
PRACTICALLY IT SERVED AS THE BASIS OF SOME REAL TELEGRAPHIC WORK BUT IS NOT NOW IN USE
AFTER COMPLETING THE MALAY PENINSULA I HAD PLANNED TO VISIT JAVA AND BORNEO
THIS ENTERPRISE IS CARRIED ON BY A CORPORATION CALLED THE EDISON PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY IN WHICH HE IS VERY LARGELY INTERESTED AND OF WHICH HE IS THE ACTIVE HEAD AND GUIDING SPIRIT
AMONG THESE WAS THE ONE COVERING THE CELEBRATED FEEDER INVENTION WHICH HAS BEEN OF VERY GREAT COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE ART ITS OBJECT BEING TO OBVIATE THE DROP IN PRESSURE RENDERING LIGHTS DIM IN THOSE PORTIONS OF AN ELECTRIC-LIGHT SYSTEM THAT WERE REMOTE FROM THE CENTRAL STATION
HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT IT COULD BE DONE AND SAID HE WOULD TRY IT HIMSELF
AT A LIGHT-RED HEAT IRON BECOMES NON-MAGNETIC SO THAT A STRONG MAGNET EXERTS NO INFLUENCE OVER IT
JULY 27 1880 239,372 TESTING ELECTRIC LIGHT CARBONS--EDISON AND BATCHELOR
AFTER ABOUT FIFTEEN MONTHS OF EXPLORATION ATTENDED BY MUCH HARDSHIP AND PRIVATION DESERTED SOMETIMES BY TREACHEROUS GUIDES TWICE LAID LOW BY FEVERS OCCASIONALLY IN PERIL FROM INDIAN ATTACKS WILD ANIMALS AND POISONOUS SERPENTS TORMENTED BY INSECT PESTS ENDANGERED BY FLOODS ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN DAYS WITHOUT MEAT NINETY-EIGHT DAYS WITHOUT TAKING OFF HIS CLOTHES MR MCGOWAN RETURNED TO AMERICA BROKEN IN HEALTH BUT HAVING FAITHFULLY FULFILLED THE COMMISSION INTRUSTED TO HIM
IT MATTERS NOT THAT OTHERS WERE WORKING IN THE SAME DIRECTION EDISON WAS LEGALLY ADJUDICATED TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO SUCCEED IN POINT OF TIME AND HIS INVENTIONS WERE PUT INTO ACTUAL USE AND MAY BE FOUND IN PRINCIPLE IN EVERY ONE OF THE 7,000,000 TELEPHONES WHICH ARE ESTIMATED TO BE EMPLOYED IN THE COUNTRY AT THE PRESENT DAY
AFTER A FEW DAYS OF FURTHER EXPERIMENT AND OBSERVATION HOWEVER HE CHANGED IT TO ETHERIC FORCE AND THE FURTHER RECORDS THEREOF ALL IN MR BATCHELOR'S HANDWRITING WERE UNDER THAT HEADING

BUT WE GOT AROUND TO THE POINT WHERE THE BOARD DECLARED A DIVIDEND EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT
PUTTING AT THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION THE MAN WHO MAKES HIS APPEAL TO PUBLIC ATTENTION SOLELY BECAUSE OF THE BRILLIANCY OF HIS PLUMAGE AND PASSING DOWN THE RANKS THROUGH THE MULTITUDES HAVING A GRADUALLY DECREASING SENSE OF VANITY IN THEIR PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT EDISON WOULD BE PLACED AT THE VERY END

WE SHOULD HOWEVER DEEM OUR PRESENTATION OF MR EDISON'S WORK TO BE IMPERFECTLY EXECUTED IF WE NEGLECTED TO INCLUDE AN INTELLIGIBLE EXPOSITION OF THE BROADER THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES OF HIS MORE IMPORTANT INVENTIONS
THE FRICTIONAL MOVEMENTS OF THE PAD WITH THE DRUM WERE COMPARATIVELY LONG OR SHORT AND CORRESPONDED WITH THE LENGTH OF THE IMPULSES SENT IN OVER THE LINE

ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE TRAIN AT 10.40 IN THE MORNING HE WENT TO THE MILL AND WITH MR MASON THE GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT STARTED AT THE CRUSHER AT ONE END AND EXAMINED EVERY DETAIL ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE PACKING-HOUSE AT THE OTHER END
AT ANOTHER TIME THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE WITH SOME OF THE DETAILS OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE DYNAMOS AND EDISON SPENT A LOT OF TIME AT GOERCK STREET WHICH HAD BEEN RAPIDLY EQUIPPED WITH THE IDEA OF TURNING OUT BI-POLAR DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINES DIRECT-CONNECTED TO THE ENGINE THE FIRST OF WHICH WENT TO PARIS AND LONDON WHILE THE NEXT WERE INSTALLED IN THE OLD PEARL STREET STATION OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC ILLUMINATING COMPANY OF NEW YORK JUST SOUTH OF FULTON STREET ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE STREET
THE COMPANY NEEDED NOT ONLY OFFICES BUT EVEN MORE SUCH AN INTERIOR AS WOULD DISPLAY TO ADVANTAGE THE NEW LIGHT IN EVERYDAY USE
AND WAS PERHAPS EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT JUST THEN THE ABILITY OF THE PHONOGRAPH AS A MONEY-MAKER WAS MUCH MORE EASILY DEMONSTRATED THAN WAS THAT OF THE TELEPHONE STILL IN ITS SHORT RANGE MAGNETO STAGE AND AWAITING DEVELOPMENT WITH THE AID OF THE CARBON TRANSMITTER
THE CHAIN OF EDISON SHOPS WAS THEN CREATED
THE MIXED TRAIN ON WHICH EDISON WAS EMPLOYED AS NEWSBOY DID THE WAY-FREIGHT WORK AND SHUNTING AT THE MOUNT CLEMENS STATION ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEING USUALLY SPENT IN THE WORK
IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT EDISON DID NOT CONFINE HIMSELF TO THE WORKING OF THE ELECTROMOTOGRAPH BY THE SLIPPING OF SURFACES THROUGH THE ACTION OF INCOMING CURRENT BUT BY VARYING THE CHARACTER OF THE SURFACES IN CONTACT THE FRICTIONAL EFFECT MIGHT BE INTENSIFIED BY THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT
OF ALL THE TELEPHONE EARNINGS OF THE BELL SYSTEM WHILE THE BELL PATENTS RAN
IMPROVEMENT IN ELECTRIC LIGHTS IN AFTER YEARS DISCUSSING THE WORK OF WALLACE WHO WAS NOT ONLY A GREAT PIONEER ELECTRICAL MANUFACTURER BUT ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE WIRE-DRAWING AND BRASS-WORKING INDUSTRY EDISON SAID
IN A CONVERSATION DURING 1909 HE REMARKED AS THOUGH IT WERE NOTHING OUT OF THE WAY THAT UP TO SEVEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY HIS AVERAGE OF DAILY WORKING HOURS WAS NINETEEN AND ONE-HALF BUT THAT SINCE THEN HE FIGURED IT AT EIGHTEEN
IN THAT ONE DAY'S PLANNING EVERY PART WAS CONSIDERED AND PROVIDED FOR FROM THE CRUSHER TO THE PACKING-HOUSE
WHETHER ONE APPROVES OR NOT IT IS AT LEAST ADMIRABLE STOICISM OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS TOO LITTLE
THEN AS NOW THE PROPOSITIONS BROUGHT TO EDISON RANGED OVER EVERY CONCEIVABLE SUBJECT BUT THE YEARS HAVE TAUGHT HIM CAUTION IN GRAPPLING WITH THEM

IT WILL BE OBVIOUS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT IF IT WERE ATTEMPTED TO SUPPLY THE GREAT ENERGY NECESSARY FOR THIS OPERATION BY DIRECT APPLICATION OF STEAM-POWER AN ENGINE OF ENORMOUS HORSE-POWER WOULD BE REQUIRED AND EVEN THEN IT IS DOUBTFUL IF ONE COULD BE CONSTRUCTED OF SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO WITHSTAND THE TERRIFIC STRAINS THAT WOULD ENSUE
WE HAD AN OPEN LAMP AND WHEN WE OPENED THE PEDESTAL IT BLEW THE DOORS OFF AND BLEW OUT THE WINDOWS AND KNOCKED ME DOWN AND THE OTHER MAN FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS 65 WAS A VERITABLE BEEHIVE DAY AND NIGHT
HERE EDISON THROWING HIMSELF DOWN SOMETIMES SEEKS A SHORT REST DURING SPECIALLY LONG WORKING TOURS
VAST INTERESTS WERE AT STAKE
IN FACT TOOLS OF ALL DESCRIPTIONS SO THAT ANY APPARATUS HOWEVER DELICATE OR HEAVY COULD BE MADE AND BUILT AS MIGHT BE REQUIRED BY EDISON IN EXPERIMENTING
BUT IN PURSUING IT HE LEAVES ALL UNCERTAINTY BEHIND AND TRUSTING NOTHING TO THEORY HE ACQUIRES ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE

AND VERY SOON WOULD COME A LINE OF SUGGESTIONS WHICH WOULD NOT END UNTIL THE DIFFICULTY WAS MET AND OVERCOME OR FOUND INSURMOUNTABLE
IN THIS WAY BY STRAINING THE WHOLE OUTFIT UP TO ITS ELASTIC LIMIT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE TORSION WAS PRACTICALLY ELIMINATED AND AFTER THAT THE GOVERNORS RAN TOGETHER ALL RIGHT EDISON REALIZED HOWEVER THAT IN COMMERCIAL PRACTICE THIS WAS ONLY A TEMPORARY EXPEDIENT AND THAT A SATISFACTORY PERMANENCE OF RESULTS COULD ONLY BE ATTAINED WITH MORE PERFECT ENGINES THAT COULD BE DEPENDED UPON FOR CLOSE AND SIMPLE REGULATION

THE DYNAMOS SUPPLYING CURRENT TO THE ROAD WERE ORIGINALLY TWO OF THE STANDARD SIZE Z MACHINES THEN BEING MADE AT THE LABORATORY POPULARLY KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE EDISON RANKS AS LONGWAISTED MARY ANNS AND THE CIRCUITS FROM THESE WERE CARRIED OUT TO THE RAILS BY UNDERGROUND CONDUCTORS
HE SEEMS TO BE CONSCIENTIOUSLY AFRAID OF APPEARING INDOLENT AND IN CONSEQUENCE SUBJECTS HIMSELF REGULARLY TO UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP
WITH THE BEST VACUUM THAT HE COULD THEN GET BY MEANS OF THE ORDINARY AIR-PUMP THE CARBONS WOULD LAST AT THE MOST ONLY FROM TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES IN A STATE OF INCANDESCENCE
WE ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH
THE STATION HAD NEITHER VOLTMETER NOR AMMETER
ADAMS SAID THAT AT ONE TIME HE WAS ABOARD A COFFEE-SHIP IN THE HARBOR OF SANTOS BRAZIL
WHEN WE ARRIVED AT DOVER NEW JERSEY WE GOT A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER AND I CALLED HIS ATTENTION TO THE QUOTATION OF THAT DAY ON GENERAL ELECTRIC
HE TOOK ENOUGH TO KILL A HORSE AND ASSERTED IT HAD AS GOOD AN EFFECT AS MORPHINE
WHERE DOES HE RANK IN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE OF GREAT AMERICANS
I WAS SMALL AND THIN AND THE LAYER REACHED ABOVE MY HEAD AND WAS ALL I COULD POSSIBLY CARRY
AND THIS DESCENDANT OF THOSE WHO HAD LEFT THE UNITED STATES FROM DISAPPROVAL OF SUCH A DOCTRINE FLUNG HIMSELF HEADLONG INTO ITS SUPPORT
ON THEIR CAPITAL STOCK
THUS THE QUANTITY OF GOOD CLINKER OBTAINABLE WAS UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED
LUTHER STIERINGER AN EXPERT GAS ENGINEER AND INVENTOR WHOSE SERVICES WERE EARLY ENLISTED ONCE SAID THAT EDISON KNEW MORE ABOUT GAS THAN ANY OTHER MAN HE HAD EVER MET
FOR BREAKAGE TOGETHER WITH 6 PER CENT
A METHOD OF TESTING A MAGNET TO ASCERTAIN THE EXISTENCE OF FLAWS IN THE IRON OR STEEL COMPOSING THE SAME
DUCOS FOR EXAMPLE EXPENDED A GREAT DEAL OF USELESS INGENUITY IN DEVISING A CAMERA BY MEANS OF WHICH A TAPE-LINE FILM COULD RECEIVE THE PHOTOGRAPHS WHILE BEING IN CONTINUOUS MOVEMENT NECESSITATING THE USE OF A SERIES OF MOVING LENSES
THIS JUST SUITED ME AS I PREFERRED NIGHT-WORK
I SOON BECAME THE POSSESSOR OF A SECOND-HAND RUHMKORFF INDUCTION COIL WHICH ALTHOUGH IT WOULD ONLY GIVE A SMALL SPARK WOULD TWIST THE ARMS AND CLUTCH THE HANDS OF A MAN SO THAT HE COULD NOT LET GO OF THE APPARATUS
FINALLY THE OPERATOR SAID TO FOX
THE DRILL OF THE STUDENT INVOLVED CHIEFLY THE ACQUISITION OF THE SPECIAL SIGNALS EMPLOYED IN RAILWAY WORK INCLUDING THE NUMERALS AND ABBREVIATIONS APPLIED TO SAVE TIME
JAMES GORDON BENNETT CAME TO ME AND ASKED THAT I TRY SOME PRIMARY EXPERIMENTS TO SEE IF AERIAL NAVIGATION WAS FEASIBLE WITH HEAVIER-THAN-AIR MACHINES
THE GREAT DRAWBACK TO THE TAKING OF PICTURES OUT-OF-DOORS HOWEVER IS THE INEVITABLE CROWD ATTRACTED BY THE NOVELTY OF THE PROCEEDINGS WHICH MAKES THE CAMERA MAN'S LIFE A TORMENT BY GETTING INTO THE FIELD OF HIS INSTRUMENT
YET SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE AND SUCCESS WAS ULTIMATELY ACCOMPLISHED BY EDISON ONLY AFTER PERSISTENT EXPERIMENTING ALONG LINES THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PREDICTED INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF APPARATUS FOR THE PURPOSE WHICH IF IT HAD NOT BEEN MADE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE CONSIDERED IMPOSSIBLE
I BELIEVE I ALSO DESIGNED A BELL AND SUPPORTS
BUT IF I GOT ENOUGH FOR IT I WOULD SELL ALL MY INTEREST IN ANY SHARE I MIGHT HAVE
THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY REMARKS EDISON WHEREBY THIS PATENT COULD BE EVADED AND ITS POSSESSOR WOULD EVENTUALLY CONTROL THE USE OF WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE RELAY AND SOUNDER AND THIS WAS VITAL TO TELEGRAPHY
ONE OF THE MOST CONSPICUOUS FEATURES OF THE ROOM IS A PHONOGRAPH EQUIPMENT ON WHICH THE LATEST AND BEST PRODUCTIONS BY THE GREATEST SINGERS AND MUSICIANS CAN ALWAYS BE HEARD BUT WHICH EDISON HIMSELF IS EVERLASTINGLY EXPERIMENTING WITH UNDER THE INCURABLE DELUSION THAT THIS DOMESTIC RETREAT IS BUT AN EXTENSION OF HIS LABORATORY
TO THIS THE READER'S ATTENTION WILL NOW BE DRAWN
AND ALWAYS BROUGHT TO BEAR ON WHAT HE WAS AT THE GREATEST SKILL WHILE EDISON DEPENDED UPON UPTON FOR HIS MATHEMATICAL WORK HE WAS WONT TO CHECK IT UP IN A VERY PRACTICAL MANNER AS EVIDENCED BY THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT DESCRIBED BY MR JEHL
SAMPLES TESTED AT SEVERAL POINTS ON THE MALAY PENINSULA SHOWED NO NEW SPECIES EXCEPT AT A POINT NORTH OF SINGAPORE WHERE I FOUND A SPECIES LARGE AND HEAVY WHICH GAVE A TEST NEARLY EQUAL TO THAT OF THE GIANT BAMBOO IN CEYLON
BUT WHEN THERE ARE MORE THEY RADIATE SOME UNKNOWN FORM OF INFLUENCE WHICH PARALYZES MY VOCAL CORDS
THE OFFICE OF THE MEMPHIS AVALANCHE WAS IN THE SAME BUILDING
THE RAILS WERE LIGHT AND WERE SPIKED TO ORDINARY SLEEPERS WITH A GAUGE OF ABOUT THREE AND ONE-HALF FEET
NOR IS HE ALONE
AFTER THE PAPER HAD GONE TO PRESS PRENTICE WOULD GENERALLY COME OVER TO TYLER'S OFFICE AND START TALKING
ALTHOUGH THE GRAPHITE APPARENTLY DID THE WORK DESIRED OF IT HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFIED WITH ITS PERFORMANCE AND MADE EXTENDED TRIALS OF OTHER SUBSTANCES BUT AT THAT TIME FOUND NOTHING THAT ON THE WHOLE SERVED THE PURPOSE BETTER
BY MARCH 1881 THERE WERE IN THE UNITED STATES ONLY NINE CITIES OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND INHABITANTS AND ONLY ONE OF MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND WITHOUT A TELEPHONE EXCHANGE
HAMMER F
AND NOT ONLY SO BUT THE LAMP AFTER ITS DESIGN MUST NOT BE A MERE LABORATORY POSSIBILITY BUT A PRACTICAL COMMERCIAL ARTICLE CAPABLE OF BEING MANUFACTURED AT LOW COST AND IN LARGE QUANTITIES
THEN I MADE OUT THE WORDS MINOR BOTTS THE NEXT WAS A NEW YORK ITEM
DURING THE WHOLE OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND UNTIL LATE IN THE SUMMER OF 1877 HE HAD BEEN WORKING WITH CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM ON THE TELEPHONE
IT IS NOT SURPRISING THEREFORE THAT IN SEPTEMBER OF THAT YEAR WHEN EDISON TURNED HIS THOUGHTS ACTIVELY TOWARD ELECTRIC LIGHTING BY INCANDESCENCE HIS EARLY EXPERIMENTS SHOULD BE IN THE LINE OF CARBON AS AN ILLUMINANT
WHEN THE KEY IS DEPRESSED CURRENT FLOWS THROUGH THE RELAY COILS AT A BUT NO MAGNETISM IS PRODUCED AS THEY OPPOSE EACH OTHER
IF ANY OPERATOR TRIED TO RECEIVE FROM BORST HE COULDN'T DO IT SO BORST AND I ALWAYS WORKED TOGETHER
THE NITRIC ACID SOON BEGAN TO COMBINE WITH THE PLASTER IN THE ROOM BELOW WHICH WAS THE PUBLIC RECEIVING-ROOM FOR MESSENGERS AND BOOKKEEPERS
IT DOES HOWEVER SEEM ENTIRELY ALLOWABLE TO SAY THAT WHILE AT THE PRESENT WRITING THE TESTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE EXTEND OVER A FEW YEARS ONLY THEIR RESULTS AND THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THIS CHARACTERISTIC EDISON INVENTION ARE OF SUCH A SUBSTANTIAL NATURE AS TO POINT TO THE INEVITABLE GROWTH OF ANOTHER GREAT INDUSTRY ARISING FROM ITS MANUFACTURE AND TO ITS WIDE-SPREAD APPLICATION TO MANY USES
SOME LEADING AUTHORITIES PRONOUNCED IT ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE OF ACHIEVEMENT ON ANY EXTENDED SCALE WHILE A VERY FEW OTHERS OF MORE OPTIMISTIC MIND COULD SEE NO GLEAM OF LIGHT THROUGH THE DARKNESS BUT CONFIDENTLY HOPED FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS BY SUCH WORKERS AS EDISON
AFTER SOME CHANGES DICTATED BY EXPERIENCE THIS ARTIFICIAL FILAMENT WAS ADOPTED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF LAMPS
AND THUS IT OCCURRED AS A MATTER OF FACT AND THE TROUBLE WAS REMEDIED
I LEARNED THAT THIS PARTICULAR CAR WAS THE ONLY ONE IN EASTON
THE INVENTOR EMPLOYED A TOOL-MAKER WHO WAS THE FINEST AND BEST TOOL-MAKER I HAD EVER SEEN
24 1906 914,372 MAKING THIN METALLIC FLAKES
TO WHICH IT MAY BE ADDED THAT NOT LESS EQUALLY HAVE THE NATURE OF INHERITANCE AND THE QUALITY OF ATAVISM BEEN EXHIBITED IN HIS EXTRAORDINARY PREDILECTION FOR THE MILLER'S ART
ROBERT C
WHEN WE FIRST PUT THE PEARL STREET STATION IN OPERATION IN NEW YORK WE HAD CAST-IRON JUNCTION-BOXES AT THE INTERSECTIONS OF ALL THE STREETS
1 1890 609,268 PHONOGRAPH DEC
MAY 21 1881 251,543 ELECTRIC LAMP
I WOULD GO DOWN TO ORANGE AND REPORT WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SATISFACTION THE INCREASE IN OUTPUT BUT MR EDISON WOULD APPARENTLY BE VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED AND OFTEN SAID TO ME THAT THE TROUBLE WAS NOT WITH THE KILN BUT WITH OUR METHOD OF OPERATING IT
HE SHOWED ME A GYROSCOPE HE HAD GOT UP WHICH MADE THE INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF 4000 REVOLUTIONS IN A SECOND
I TOOK THEM TO RAILROAD BUILDINGS ELECTRIC-LIGHT PLANTS FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND SHOWED THEM A GREAT VARIETY OF THINGS
SITTING AROUND THE ROOM WERE ABOUT A DOZEN FINE-LOOKING MEN
MEANS FOR REGULATING EQUALIZING THEIR LOADS AND ADJUSTING THE NUMBER OF DYNAMOS TO BE USED ACCORDING TO THE FLUCTUATING DEMANDS ON THE CENTRAL STATION
MR SPRAGUE REALIZED THE TROUBLE QUICKLY THREW OFF THE CURRENT AND STOPPED THE ENGINE
26 1882 317,632 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
THE NON-TECHNICAL READER MAY WONDER WHAT USE CAN POSSIBLY BE MADE OF AN APPARENTLY NON-OPERATIVE PIECE OF APPARATUS
IT IS AT SUCH TIMES AS THESE THAT HIS UNFAILING PATIENCE AND TREMENDOUS RESOURCEFULNESS ARE IN EVIDENCE
IN HIS NOTES MR JEHL SAYS
THE REASON WHY THOSE LITTLE PRELIMINARY EXPLOSIONS TOOK PLACE WAS THAT A LITTLE HAD SPATTERED OUT ON THE EDGE OF THE FILTER PAPER AND HAD DRIED FIRST AND EXPLODED
THINKING PERSONS KNOW THAT BLATANT MEN NEVER ACCOMPLISH MUCH AND EDISON'S MARVELLOUS BREVITY OF SPEECH ALONG WITH HIS MIRACULOUS ACHIEVEMENTS SHOULD DO MUCH TO PUT BORES AND GARRULITY OUT OF FASHION ALTHOUGH EDISON HAD INSTITUTED SUCH A COSTLY AND EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH THROUGHOUT THE WORLD FOR THE MOST PERFECT OF NATURAL FIBRES HE DID NOT NECESSARILY FEEL COMMITTED FOR ALL TIME TO THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THAT MATERIAL FOR HIS LAMP FILAMENTS
RECOGNIZING THIS FACT EDISON ALWAYS SOUGHT FOR A VERY HIGH SPEED SO AS TO GIVE SMOOTH AND NATURAL REPRODUCTIONS AND EVEN WITH HIS EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS OBTAINED UPWARD OF FORTY-EIGHT PICTURES PER SECOND WHEREAS IN PRACTICE AT THE PRESENT TIME THE ACCEPTED RATE VARIES BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY PER SECOND
DURING THE ROTATION OF THE CYLINDER A CURRENT WOULD PASS THROUGH WHEEL W AND ACTUATE TM DRAWING DOWN THE ARMATURE AND OPERATING THE ESCAPEMENT WHICH WOULD BRING THE TYPE-WHEEL TO A POINT WHERE THE LETTER A WOULD BE CENTRAL AS REGARDS THE PAPER TAPE WHEN THE CYLINDER CAME TO REST CURRENT WOULD FLOW THROUGH THE BRUSH OF WHEEL W TO PM AND ITS ARMATURE WOULD BE ATTRACTED CAUSING THE PLATEN TO BE LIFTED AND THUS BRINGING THE PAPER TAPE IN CONTACT WITH THE TYPE-WHEEL AND PRINTING THE LETTER A
AFTER I HAD BEEN AN HOUR AT THE PLAY THE MANAGER CAME AROUND AND ASKED ME TO GO UNDERNEATH THE STAGE AS THEY WERE PUTTING ON A BALLET OF 300 GIRLS THE FINEST BALLET IN EUROPE
CASTOR OIL 5 LBS THE EMPIRICAL NATURE OF HIS METHOD WILL BE APPARENT FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THE ABOVE ITEMS
AND EXCEPT IN REGARD TO FURNISHING ISOLATED PLANTS HE DID NOT PURSUE FURTHER THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYDRO-ELECTRIC STATIONS
I HAD TO TAKE WHAT CAME
IT NEVER AFFECTED ME IT IS WORTH PAUSING JUST A MOMENT TO GLANCE AT THIS MAN TAKING A FITFUL REST ON A PILE OF IRON PIPE IN A DINGY BUILDING
CITRIC ACID 5 LBS
IT WAS FOR GENERAL THOMAS AT NASHVILLE
HE WOULD GO DOWN TO THE LABORATORY AND EXPERIMENT ONLY STOPPING FOR A SHORT TIME AT NOON TO EAT A LUNCH SENT DOWN FROM THE HOUSE
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER SEEN HIM
THIS PROVED TO BE A MOST KNOTTY AND INTRICATE PUZZLE--TRICKY AND EVASIVE--ALWAYS LEADING ON AND PROMISING SOMETHING AND AT THE LAST SLIPPING AWAY LEAVING THE WORK UNDONE
THESE ALSO WERE INVENTED BY EDISON BUT ANTEDATED THOSE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED
BUT WITH CHARACTERISTIC INSIGHT MR RATHENAU HERE PLACED HIS FINGER ON THE GREAT MERIT THAT HAS OFTEN BEEN FORGOTTEN
HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT AT THE FRENCH EXPOSITION OF 1867 MR PORTER INSTALLED TWO PORTER-ALLEN ENGINES TO DRIVE ELECTRIC ALTERNATING-CURRENT GENERATORS FOR SUPPLYING CURRENT TO PRIMITIVE LIGHTHOUSE APPARATUS
ON ONE OCCASION RECEIVING A MEDAL IN NEW YORK EDISON FORGOT IT ON THE FERRY-BOAT AND LEFT IT BEHIND HIM
IT BECAME KNOWN IN SCIENTIFIC PARLANCE AS THE EDISON EFFECT SHOWING A CURIOUS CURRENT CONDITION OR DISCHARGE IN THE VACUUM OF THE BULB
HE DOUBLED THE PRODUCTION INSIDE THREE MONTHS WITHOUT MATERIALLY INCREASING THE PAY-ROLL BY INCREASING THE CUTTING SPEEDS OF TOOLS AND BY THE USE OF VARIOUS DEVICES
ON THE CONTRARY MEN ENGAGED IN OTHER PROFESSIONS FIND AS A RULE THAT THEY IMPROVE AND ADVANCE WITH EXPERIENCE AND THAT AGE BRINGS LARGER REWARDS AND OPPORTUNITIES
ON LOOKING UP UNDER THE SECOND GALLERY AT THIS END IS SEEN A GREAT ROLL RESTING IN SOCKETS PLACED ON EACH SIDE OF THE ROOM
HE WILL SEE THE GENERAL NATURE OF A RESULT LONG BEFORE IT CAN BE REACHED BY MATHEMATICAL CALCULATION THIS WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY ONE OF HIS ENGINEERING STAFF WHO REMARKED
GROUPED ABOUT HIS FEET ARE A GEAR-WHEEL VOLTAIC PILE TELEGRAPH KEY AND TELEPHONE
INSTEAD OF TIN-FOIL A WAX CYLINDER IS EMPLOYED THE RECORD BEING CUT THEREON BY A CUTTING-TOOL ATTACHED TO A DIAPHRAGM WHILE THE REPRODUCTION IS EFFECTED BY MEANS OF A BLUNT STYLUS SIMILARLY ATTACHED
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU MAKE HERE THE BROCKTON STATION WAS FOR A LONG TIME A SHOW PLANT OF THE EDISON COMPANY AND HAD MANY DISTINGUISHED VISITORS AMONG THEM BEING PROF ELIHU THOMSON WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE OPENING AND SIR W
THEY WORKED WITH A FEROCIOUS ENERGY WHICH WAS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE ACTUAL RESULT ACHIEVED
IN PHONOGRAPHIC WORK WE CAN USE OUR EARS AND OUR EYES AIDED WITH POWERFUL MICROSCOPES
IN ONE OF THE MANY EXPERIMENTAL-ROOMS LINING THE SIDES OF THE SECOND FLOOR MAY USUALLY BE SEEN HIS YOUNGER BROTHER FRED OTT WHOSE SKILL AS A DEXTEROUS MANIPULATOR AND INGENIOUS MECHANIC HAS FOUND AMPLE SCOPE FOR EXERCISE DURING THE THIRTY-TWO YEARS OF HIS SERVICE WITH EDISON NOT ONLY AT THE REGULAR LABORATORIES BUT ALSO AT THAT CONNECTED WITH THE INVENTOR'S WINTER HOME IN FLORIDA
A FAMOUS CONTRACT BEARING DATE OF NOVEMBER 10 1879 SHOWED THAT UNDER THE EDISON AND OTHER CONTROLLING PATENTS THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY HAD ALREADY SET GOING SOME EIGHTY-FIVE EXCHANGES AND WAS MAKING LARGE QUANTITIES OF TELEPHONIC APPARATUS
I HAD PICKED THE BEST OPERATORS IN NEW YORK AND THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE APPARATUS
BUT IT WILL BE APPROPRIATE BEFORE PASSING ON TO NOTE THAT ON JANUARY 17 1908 WHILE THIS BIOGRAPHY WAS BEING WRITTEN MR EDISON BECAME THE FOURTH RECIPIENT OF THE JOHN FRITZ GOLD MEDAL FOR ACHIEVEMENT IN INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS
WITH SOMMERS ON ONE OCCASION HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO INDULGE HIS ALWAYS STRONG SENSE OF HUMOR
HOW CAN SUCH A TRAIT--AND SCORES OF SIMILAR EXPERIENCES COULD BE GIVEN--BE EXPLAINED EXCEPT BY THE FACT THAT EVIDENTLY HE FELT THE NEED OF SPECIAL SCHOOLING IN INDUSTRY--THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MUST HE ALLOW A THOUGHT OF INDOLENCE TO ENTER HIS MIND
AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS NEW ATTEMPTS EDISON RETURNED TO HIS EXPERIMENTS WITH CARBON AS AN INCANDESCENT BURNER FOR A LAMP AND MADE A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF TRIALS ALL IN VACUO
ROYALTY
I WOULD GO TO THE BOX FOUR OR FIVE TIMES TO GET A CIGAR BUT AFTER IT GOT CIRCULATED ABOUT THE BUILDING EVERYBODY WOULD COME TO GET MY CIGARS SO THAT THE BOX WOULD ONLY LAST ABOUT A DAY AND A HALF
I REMEMBER FOR INSTANCE OUR INTERVIEWS WITH MESSRS
THESE ROLLS WERE OF CAST IRON THREE FEET IN DIAMETER HAVING CHILLED-IRON SMOOTH FACE-PLATES OF CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS
HE FOUGHT ALL THROUGH THE LONG WAR OF INDEPENDENCE--SEVEN YEARS--AND THEN APPEARS TO HAVE SETTLED DOWN AT STONINGTON CONNECTICUT
GEORGE PULLMAN WHO THEN HAD A SMALL SHOP AT DETROIT AND WAS WORKING ON HIS SLEEPING-CAR MADE EDISON A LOT OF WOODEN APPARATUS FOR HIS CHEMICALS TO THE BOY'S DELIGHT
IT WOULD STRIKE ON THE WIRES HE SAYS WITH AN EXPLOSION LIKE A CANNON-SHOT MAKING THAT OFFICE NO PLACE FOR AN OPERATOR WITH HEART-DISEASE AROUND THE DINGY WALLS WERE A DOZEN TABLES THE ENDS NEXT TO THE WALL
NOT INFREQUENTLY HE IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE MANIPULATION OF SOME COMPOUND OF SPECIAL INTRICACY WHOSE RESULTS MIGHT BE ILLUMINATIVE OF OBSCURE FACTS NOT PATENT TO OTHERS THAN HIMSELF
BUT DOWN TO THE PRESENT MOMENT THE PEREGRINATIONS OF THIS VERSATILE GENIUS OF THE KEY HAVE NEVER CEASED IN ONE HEMISPHERE OR THE OTHER SO THAT AS MR ADAMS HIMSELF REMARKED TO THE AUTHORS IN APRIL 1908
FOR THE FIRST TIME MAN HAD COMMAND OF A STEADY SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY WITHOUT TOIL OR EFFORT
A WEEK AFTER THAT I HAD OCCASION TO GO TO NEW YORK AND VISITING THE OFFICE OF THE LESSEE OF THE WIRE I ASKED HIM IF HE HADN'T SENT SUCH AND SUCH A MESSAGE
WHY IS IT THAT WHEN WE HAVE PRODUCED THE ELECTRICITY HALF OF IT MUST SLIP AWAY
1 AUSTRALIA
SOON ALL THE MEN GOT SALIVATED AND THINGS LOOKED SERIOUS
THERE NEVER WAS A MONOPOLY IN INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTING AND EVEN FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS COMPETITORS AND INFRINGERS WERE IN THE FIELD REAPING THE BENEFITS AND THOUGH DEFEATED IN THE END PAYING NOT A CENT OF TRIBUTE
THE ABSENCE OF ANY VITIATING EFFECT ON THE ATMOSPHERE THE OBVIOUS SAFETY FROM FIRE
IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE ENTRANCE DOOR AND THIS STATUE HAS LONG STOOD A MAGNIFICENT PALM BUT AT THE PRESENT WRITING IT HAS BEEN SET ASIDE TO GIVE PLACE TO A FINE MODEL OF THE FIRST TYPE OF THE EDISON POURED CEMENT HOUSE WHICH STANDS IN A MINIATURE ARTIFICIAL LAWN UPON A SPECIAL TABLE PREPARED FOR IT
THIS WAS ALSO ACCOMPLISHED
THE PERFORATIONS OF THE CONTAINING TUBE THROUGH WHICH THE ELECTROLYTE REACHES THE ACTIVE MATERIAL ARE ALSO SHOWN IN FIG
RECOGNIZING AT ONCE THE ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE CHARACTER OF THE PHENOMENA HE CONTINUED HIS INVESTIGATIONS ENTHUSIASTICALLY OVER TWO MOUTHS FINALLY ARRIVING AT A CORRECT CONCLUSION AS TO THE OSCILLATORY NATURE OF THE HITHERTO UNKNOWN MANIFESTATIONS

THE IDEAS AND METHODS OF MURDOCH AND LEBON SOON TOOK DEFINITE SHAPE AND COAL SMOKE WAS PIPED FROM ITS PLACE OF ORIGIN TO DISTANT POINTS OF CONSUMPTION
AND THE CROWD YELLED THE POLICEMAN YELLED
PHILIPP REIS A SIMPLE PROFESSOR IN GERMANY UTILIZED THIS PRINCIPLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF APPARATUS FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF SOUND
I NOW HAD FIVE SHOPS AND WITH EXPERIMENTING ON THIS NEW SCHEME I WAS PRETTY BUSY
THE FUNCTION OF THE FLOATING WEIGHT IS TO AUTOMATICALLY KEEP THE STYLUS IN CLOSE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE RECORD THUS INSURING ACCURACY OF REPRODUCTION
WHEN ONE OF THE TAMMANY ASPIRANTS APPEARED HE WAS TOLD TO GO RIGHT TO WORK AT $1.50 PER DAY
HENCE WE SHALL CONFINE OURSELVES TO A FEW ITEMS OF PREDOMINATING IMPORTANCE ALREADY REFERRED TO IN THE NARRATIVE COMMENCING WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL MAGNETIC ORE SEPARATOR WHICH WAS COVERED BY UNITED STATES PATENT NO
EDISON REVELLED IN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDY AND EXPERIMENT GIVEN HIM BY HIS LONG HOURS OF FREEDOM IN THE DAYTIME BUT NEEDED SLEEP JUST AS ANY HEALTHY YOUTH DOES
ONE DAY I ASKED HIM HOW LONG IT WAS SINCE HE HAD BEEN TO SEA AND HE REPLIED TWO OR THREE YEARS
THE FIRST ELECTRICAL ENGINEER GRADUATED FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY NEW YORK FOLLOWED UP HIS STUDIES WHILE A NIGHT OPERATOR AND CAME OUT BRILLIANTLY AT THE HEAD OF HIS CLASS
THE EXUBERANT WIT AND FANCY OF THE FEUILLETONISTS SEIZED UPON HIS VARIOUS INVENTIONS EVOLVING FROM THEM OTHERS OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY NATURE WITH WHICH TO BEDAZZLE AND BEWILDER THE READER

MAIL BUT FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS NOT USED
THAT SHOWS THE BEAUTY OF NEW YORK RECEIVERSHIPS IT IS HARDLY TO BE WONDERED AT THAT EDISON IS RATHER FRANK AND UNSPARING IN SOME OF HIS CRITICISMS OF SHADY MODERN BUSINESS METHODS AND THE MENTION OF THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT ALWAYS PROVOKES HIM TO A FINE SCORN

WHY MANKIND SHOULD SLEEP THROUGH SEVERAL HOURS OF SUNLIGHT IN THE MORNING AND STAY AWAKE THROUGH A NEEDLESS TIME IN THE EVENING CAN PROBABLY ONLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO TOTAL DEPRAVITY

IN THE TWO END PIECES OF A HEAVY IRON FRAME WERE SET THREE ROLLS OR CYLINDERS--ONE IN THE CENTRE ANOTHER BELOW AND THE OTHER ABOVE--ALL THREE BEING IN A VERTICAL LINE
THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD A LITTLE CURL RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF HER FOREHEAD
NOT ONLY WAS IT A NEW INDUSTRY ONE WITHOUT SHADOW OF PROTOTYPE BUT THE MECHANICAL DEVICES FOR MAKING THE LAMPS AND TO SOME EXTENT THE VERY MACHINES TO MAKE THOSE DEVICES WERE TO BE INVENTED
THOSE WHO WERE NOT GOT A PIECE OF RANCID SALT PORK FROM THE SKIPPER AND CUT A LARGE THICK SLICE OUT OF IT
EDISON WITH CHARACTERISTIC THOROUGHNESS TOOK UP A LINE OF INVESTIGATION AND AFTER A PROLONGED SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS SUCCEEDED IN INVENTING A MIXTURE THAT UPON HARDENING REMAINED UNIFORM THROUGHOUT ITS MASS
AND IF THE RELAY IS ACTUATED BY A WEAK CURRENT THE ARMATURE WILL BE ATTRACTED BUT FEEBLY

DECEMBER 26 1875
DOCTOR BEARD IN HIS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TREATISE REFERS ON PAGE 27 TO THE VIEWS OF OTHERS WHO HAVE REPEATED EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVED THE PHENOMENA AND IN A FOOT-NOTE SAYS
IT WAS AT FIRST HEATED BY MEANS OF OPEN COAL GRATES WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ALTOGETHER ADEQUATE IN SEVERE WINTERS OWING TO THE ALTITUDE AND THE NORTH-EASTERN EXPOSURE BUT A LARGE FURNACE IS ONE OF THE MORE MODERN CHANGES
HERE HE COULD EXPERIMENT TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND INVENT ON A LARGER BOLDER SCALE THAN EVER--AND HE DID
HE HAD BEEN LONG IMPRESSED BY THE DESIRABILITY OF THE RAPID PRODUCTION OF COPIES OF WRITTEN DOCUMENTS AND AS WE HAVE SEEN BY A PREVIOUS CHAPTER HE INVENTED THE ELECTRIC PEN FOR THIS PURPOSE ONLY TO IMPROVE UPON IT LATER WITH A MORE DESIRABLE DEVICE WHICH HE CALLED THE MIMEOGRAPH THAT IS IN USE IN VARIOUS FORMS AT THIS TIME
THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF THE KILN HOWEVER PROVED THEIR CRITICISMS TO BE UNWARRANTED
HE ASKED ME IF IT COULD BE DONE
IN PRACTICE A SMALL AMOUNT OF POWER IS APPLIED TO RUN THE GIANT ROLLS GRADUALLY UP TO A SURFACE SPEED OF SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET A MINUTE
THE PRESENTATION OF THE CASE TO THE COURTS HAD IN BOTH INSTANCES BEEN MARKED BY MASTERLY AND ABLE ARGUMENTS ELUCIDATED BY EXPERIMENTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS TO EDUCATE THE JUDGES ON TECHNICAL POINTS
SOME YEARS LATER HE WAS INFORMED THAT BOTH HIS COMPANIONS HAD GONE TO VERA CRUZ MEXICO AND HAD DIED THERE OF YELLOW FEVER
TAKING ONE OF THE LABORATORY NOTE-BOOKS HE WILL WRITE IN IT A MEMORANDUM OF THE EXPERIMENTS TO BE TRIED ILLUSTRATED IF NECESSARY BY SKETCHES
THUS FAR WE HAVE CONCERNED OURSELVES CHIEFLY WITH THOSE FIGURES WHICH EXHIBIT THE EXTENT OF INVESTMENT AND PRODUCTION BUT THERE IS ANOTHER AND HUMANLY IMPORTANT SIDE THAT PRESENTS ITSELF FOR CONSIDERATION NAMELY THE EMPLOYMENT OF A VAST INDUSTRIAL ARMY OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO EARN A LIVING THROUGH THEIR CONNECTION WITH SOME OF THE ARTS AND INDUSTRIES TO WHICH OUR NARRATIVE HAS DIRECT REFERENCE
PRESIDENT CLEVELAND WAS BORN IN THAT QUIET HAMLET
FROM THIS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE LOCOMOTIVE HAD ALL THE ESSENTIAL PARAPHERNALIA TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A STEAM LOCOMOTIVE
BUT WITH EDISON'S INVENTIVE FERTILITY--IF EVER THERE WAS A CROSS-FERTILIZER OF MECHANICAL IDEAS IT IS HE--AND WITH MR KRUESI'S NEVER-FAILING PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE APPLIED TO EXPERIMENT AND EVOLUTION RAPID PROGRESS WAS MADE
WE LEANED UP AGAINST A TREE AND CRIED
BUT THE RESULTS OBTAINED WERE POOR AND IN THEIR NECESSITY THE PARTIES IN INTEREST TURNED TO EDISON
IN FACT I HAVE OFTEN BEEN IMPRESSED STRONGLY WITH THE FACT THAT DURING THE DARK DAYS OF THE CONCENTRATING PROBLEM MR EDISON'S DESIRE WAS VERY STRONG THAT THE CREDITORS OF THE CONCENTRATING WORKS SHOULD BE PAID IN FULL

CALLING ON HIS NEAREST FRIEND THE NEXT MORNING FOR EVEN A PAIR OF SUSPENDERS MR ANDREWS WAS MET WITH REGRETS OF INABILITY BECAUSE THE BURGLARS HAD ALSO BEEN THERE
THERE WILL BE AS IT WERE A LIVING REPRESENTATION OF NATURE AND THE SAME SCENE WILL BE REPRODUCED UPON THE SCREEN WITH THE SAME DEGREE OF ANIMATION
BUT I HAVE OFTEN FELT THAT MR EDISON NEVER COULD COMPREHEND THE LIMITATIONS OF THE STRENGTH OF OTHER MEN AS HIS OWN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL STRENGTH HAVE ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE WITHOUT LIMIT

ON EACH SIDE OF THE HALLWAY ABOVE MENTIONED ROOMS ARE PARTITIONED OFF AND USED FOR EXPERIMENTAL WORK OF VARIOUS KINDS MOSTLY PHONOGRAPHIC ALTHOUGH ON THIS FLOOR ARE ALSO LOCATED THE STORAGE-BATTERY TESTING-ROOM A CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL ROOM AND EDISON'S PRIVATE OFFICE WHERE ALL HIS PERSONAL CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS ARE CONDUCTED BY HIS PERSONAL SECRETARY MR H
THEY TOLD STORIES ALL THE AFTERNOON AND THAT NIGHT THEY LEFT FOR CHICAGO

ON COMING TO INVESTIGATE IT APPEARED THAT THE BOX OF CIGARS HAD BEEN DELIVERED AND HAD BEEN PUT IN MY DESK AND I HAD SMOKED THEM ALL

OF COURSE IN THIS WORK MANY OTHER THINGS WERE DONE THAT MAY STILL BE FOUND ON THE PERFECTED PHONOGRAPH AS IT STANDS TO-DAY AND MANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE WHICH WERE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY ADOPTED BUT WHICH WERE LATER ABANDONED
BY ONE OF THESE TWO SYSTEMS A SINGLE WIRE COULD BE USED FOR SENDING TWO MESSAGES IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND BY THE OTHER IN THE SAME DIRECTION OR IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
THE DISKS ARE COMPRESSED BY MEANS OF AN ADJUSTABLE SCREW
AT THE FORMER PRICE HE COULD HAVE SUPPLIED THE MARKET AND EARNED A LIBERAL PROFIT ON HIS INVESTMENT BUT AT $3.50 PER TON HE WAS LEFT WITHOUT A REASONABLE CHANCE OF COMPETITION
SUCH RESULTS WERE EVIDENTLY NOT OF COMMERCIAL VALUE
BUT THE UNFORTUNATE GENERAL WHO IS STILL AN EMPLOYEE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL AND EVEN NOW TWELVE YEARS AFTERWARD HE SAYS WITH A GRIN THAT WHENEVER HE HAS A MOMENT OF LEISURE HE TAKES THE TIME TO PICK A FEW PIECES OF GLASS FROM HIS PERSON

AT EIGHTY-FIVE I EXPECT TO WEAR A FULL-DRESS SUIT EVERY EVENING AT DINNER AND AT NINETY--WELL I NEVER PLAN MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AHEAD THE REFERENCE TO CLOTHES IS INTERESTING AS IT IS ONE OF THE FEW SUBJECTS IN WHICH EDISON HAS NO INTEREST

HE HAD RESIGNED THAT POSITION IN 1885 AND HAD SPENT THE INTERVENING PERIOD IN EXPLOITING THE EDISON MUNICIPAL SYSTEM OF LIGHTING AS WELL AS TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN VARIOUS OTHER BRANCHES OF THE EDISON ENTERPRISES
STILL CONSIDERING HIS INFLUENCE ON OTHER STAPLES AND COLLATERAL TRADES LET US ENUMERATE BRIEFLY AND IN A GENERAL MANNER SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT AND ADDITIONAL ONES THAT HAVE BEEN NOT MERELY STIMULATED BUT IN MANY CASES THE BUSINESS AND SALES HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY INCREASED AND NEW ARTS ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE INVENTIONS OF THIS ONE MAN--NAMELY IRON STEEL BRASS ZINC NICKEL PLATINUM $5 PER OUNCE IN 1878 NOW $26 AN OUNCE RUBBER OILS WAX BITUMEN VARIOUS CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS BELTING BOILERS INJECTORS STRUCTURAL STEEL IRON TUBING GLASS SILK COTTON PORCELAIN FINE WOODS SLATE MARBLE ELECTRICAL MEASURING INSTRUMENTS MISCELLANEOUS MACHINERY COAL WIRE PAPER BUILDING MATERIALS SAPPHIRES AND MANY OTHERS

BY CONNECTING X TO THE GAS-PIPE WE DREW SPARKS FROM THE GAS-PIPES IN ANY PART OF THE ROOM BY DRAWING AN IRON WIRE OVER THE BRASS JET OF THE COCK
REMEMBERING THIS I SUBSTITUTED A PIECE OF CHALK ROTATED BY A SMALL ELECTRIC MOTOR FOR THE MAGNET AND CONNECTING A SOUNDER TO A METALLIC FINGER RESTING ON THE CHALK THE COMBINATION CLAIM OF PAGE WAS MADE WORTHLESS
THE PLATES ARE PREPARED AND FORMED IN VARIOUS WAYS AND THE CHEMICAL ACTIONS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE ABOVE STATED THE POSITIVE PLATE BEING OXIDIZED AND THE NEGATIVE REDUCED DURING CHARGE AND REVERSED DURING DISCHARGE THIS TYPE OF CELL HOWEVER HAS MANY SERIOUS DISADVANTAGES INHERENT TO ITS VERY NATURE
NOBODY KNEW WHERE IT WAS
THE VOICE-ENGINE OR PHONOMOTOR CONVERTS THE VIBRATIONS OF THE VOICE OR OF MUSIC ACTING ON THE DIAPHRAGM INTO MOTION WHICH IS UTILIZED TO DRIVE SOME SECONDARY APPLIANCE WHETHER AS A TOY OR FOR SOME USEFUL PURPOSE
WE THEN WENT TO THE DYNAMO-ROOM WHERE I POINTED OUT THE MACHINES CONVERTING THE STEAM-POWER INTO ELECTRICITY APPEARING LATER IN THE FORM OF LIGHT IN THE LAMPS
HENRY OBSERVED THINGS OF THE KIND AND EDISON NOTICED SOME CURIOUS PHENOMENA AND SAID IT WAS NOT ELECTRICITY BUT ETHERIC FORCE THAT CAUSED THESE SPARKS
A GLANCE FROM THE CAR WINDOWS REVEALS ONLY A GENTLY ROLLING LANDSCAPE DOTTED WITH MODEST RESIDENCES AND UNPRETENTIOUS BARNS
BEFORE SETTING OUT ON THE PREPARATION OF A PICTURE THE BOOK IS FIRST WRITTEN--KNOWN IN THE BUSINESS AS A SCENARIO--GIVING A COMPLETE STATEMENT AS TO THE SCENERY DROPS AND BACKGROUND AND THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS DIVIDED INTO SCENES AS IN AN ORDINARY PLAY
ONE NIGHT TO TEST HIS ALLEGED FEARLESSNESS A MAN STATIONED HIMSELF BEHIND A TREE AND ENVELOPED HIMSELF IN A SHEET
BUT SURPRISE IS OFTEN EXPRESSED AT HIS FUND OF MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION
IT SEEMED TO TAKE AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF MATHEMATICS
BELOW THE EIGHT-INCH MAGNETS THE DUST IS BLOWN OUT OF THE PARTICLES MECHANICALLY AND THEY THEN GO TO THE FOUR-INCH MAGNETS FOR FINAL CLEANSING AND SEPARATION
WHEN EVENING CAME ON AND THE LAST RAYS OF THE SETTING SUN PENETRATED THROUGH THE SIDE WINDOWS THIS HALL LOOKED LIKE A VERITABLE FAUST LABORATORY
I WAS IN THE CONDITION OF SAM HOUSTON THE PIONEER AND FOUNDER OF TEXAS WHO IT WAS SAID KNEW NO FEAR

SOME EVEN IGNORE OR DENY THE FACT TO BE EXPLAINED HERE FOLLOWS HIS EXPLANATION AFTER WHICH HE GOES ON TO SAY
THUS A MAN CAN ACTUALLY TALK A HOLE THROUGH A BOARD
THE REFERENCE LETTERS IN EACH CASE INDICATE IDENTICAL PARTS
FOLLOWS HIM THROUGH A SERIES OF INNUMERABLE EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED METHODICALLY REACHING OUT LIKE RAYS OF SEARCH-LIGHT INTO ALL THE REGIONS OF SCIENCE AND NATURE AND FINALLY EXHIBITS HIM EMERGING TRIUMPHANTLY FROM COUNTLESS DIFFICULTIES BEARING WITH HIM IN NEW ARTS THE FRUITS OF VICTORIOUS STRUGGLE
AFTER I HAD MADE A GREAT NUMBER OF INVENTIONS AND OBTAINED PATENTS THE GENERAL SEEMED ANXIOUS THAT THE MATTER SHOULD BE CLOSED UP
A LOOSE ROAD WITH A FEW INCHES OF DUST OR PEBBLES ON IT OFFERS APPRECIABLE RESISTANCE TO THE WHEELS OF VEHICLES TRAVELLING OVER IT
THESE INSTRUMENTS WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN MADE WITH INTERCHANGEABLE PARTS
HE HAS JUST BEEN DECORATED AND AWARDED HIGH HONORS BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT
I FELT THAT THIS WAS RUNNING HOSPITALITY INTO THE GROUND SO I PULLED THEM OUT AND LEFT THEM ON THE FLOOR TO COOL OFF FROM THEIR ALCOHOLIC TRANCE EDISON SEEMS ON THE WHOLE TO HAVE BEEN FAIRLY COMFORTABLE AND HAPPY IN LOUISVILLE SURROUNDING HIMSELF WITH BOOKS AND EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS AND EVEN INDITING A TREATISE ON ELECTRICITY

AND THE EFFECT OF SUCH TREATMENT WOULD BE CONFUSING
I THINK THE MACHINE IS STILL RUNNING 1907 THE STATION WENT INTO OPERATION SOON AFTER WITH AN EQUIPMENT OF EIGHT EDISON K DYNAMOS WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS INIMICAL TO EFFICIENCY BUT WHICH HAVE NOT HINDERED THE SPLENDID EXPANSION OF THE LOCAL SYSTEM
THEY ARE THEREFORE COMMUNICATED TO THE DIAPHRAGM
ONE IS REMINDED OF PALISSY'S RECKLESSNESS WHEN IN HIS EFFORTS TO MAKE THE ENAMEL MELT ON HIS POTTERY HE USED THE VERY FURNITURE OF HIS HOME FOR FIREWOOD
THAT ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN APPLIED UNDER ONE FORM OR ANOTHER IN SOME TWENTY-TWO PREVIOUS PATENTS AND IN TWO OTHER MACHINES NOT PATENTED TO-WIT THE CENTRAL GLASS AND KUNY KAHBEL ONES
ONE OF THE PECULIARITIES I HAVE NOTICED IS THAT I HAVE NEVER KNOWN HIM TO BREAK INTO A CONVERSATION GOING ON AROUND HIM AND ASK WHAT PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT
THIS PAPER WHILE STILL IN A DAMP CONDITION WAS PASSED BETWEEN THE DRUM AND STYLUS IN CONTINUOUS PROGRESSIVE MOTION
ENCYCLOPAEDIAS OF VARIOUS KINDS
APRIL 29 1890 437,429 PHONOGRAM BLANK
BUT TO-DAY NEARLY THIRTY-FIVE YEARS LATER TELEGRAPHY IN AMERICA IS STILL PRACTICALLY ON A BASIS OF HAND TRANSMISSION
THIS SYSTEM WAS PUT IN COMMERCIAL OPERATION BUT THE COMPANY NOW ENCOURAGED WAS QUITE WILLING TO ALLOW EDISON TO WORK OUT HIS IDEA OF AN AUTOMATIC THAT WOULD PRINT THE MESSAGE IN BOLD ROMAN LETTERS INSTEAD OF IN DOTS AND DASHES
AT THE TABLE SAYS EDISON THERE WERE NEVER MORE THAN TEN OR TWELVE PEOPLE
THESE CHEMICAL ACTIONS RESULT IN THE GENERATION OF AN ELECTRIC CURRENT AS IN A PRIMARY BATTERY
WE HAD TO CALL OUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
THE GREAT EXCITEMENT OVER THE GOLD DISCOVERIES WAS THUS FELT IN MILAN AND THESE WAGONS LADEN WITH ALL THE WORLDLY POSSESSIONS OF THEIR OWNERS WERE WATCHED OUT OF SIGHT ON THEIR LONG JOURNEY BY THIS FASCINATED URCHIN WHOSE OWN DISCOVERIES IN LATER YEARS WERE TO TEMPT MANY OTHER ARGONAUTS INTO THE AURIFEROUS REALMS OF ELECTRICITY
IN OPERATING THE MACHINE THE RECORDING DIAPHRAGM WAS ADVANCED NEARLY TO THE CYLINDER SO THAT AS THE DIAPHRAGM WAS VIBRATED BY THE VOICE THE NEEDLE WOULD PRICK OR INDENT A WAVE-LIKE RECORD IN THE TIN-FOIL THAT WAS ON THE CYLINDER
FOR EXAMPLE IT IS QUITE DEMONSTRABLE THAT DURING THE MAKING OF A SIMPLE DASH OF THE MORSE ALPHABET BY THE NEUTRAL RELAY AT THE HOME STATION THE DISTANT POLE-CHANGER MAY REVERSE ITS BATTERY SEVERAL TIMES
THAT THE WHOLE MACHINE IS ONLY AN AGGREGATION OF WELL-KNOWN MECHANICAL ELEMENTS THAT ANY SKILLED DESIGNER WOULD BRING TO HIS USE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH A MACHINE THIS CERTAINLY UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS WOULD SETTLE THE MATTER BEYOND PERADVENTURE
THIS MACHINE WAS LAID ON ITS SIDE WITH THE ARMATURE END COMING OUT AT THE FRONT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE AND THE MOTIVE POWER WAS APPLIED TO THE DRIVING-AXLE BY A CUMBERSOME SERIES OF FRICTION PULLEYS

AS A MATTER OF FACT THE FIRST EDISON COMMERCIAL STATION TO BE OPERATED IN THIS COUNTRY WAS THAT AT APPLETON WISCONSIN BUT ITS ONLY SERIOUS CLAIM TO NOTICE IS THAT IT WAS THE INITIAL ONE OF THE SYSTEM DRIVEN BY WATER-POWER
I THOUGHT IT VERY STRANGE BUT HAD NO SUSPICIONS UNTIL I BEGAN TO SEE MY INVENTIONS RECORDED IN THE PATENT OFFICE GAZETTE AS BEING PATENTED BY OTHERS
38 NEW ZEALAND
IT IS EASY AFTER AN IMPORTANT INVENTION HAS GONE INTO PUBLIC USE FOR PERSONS TO COME FORWARD WITH CLAIMS THAT THEY INVENTED THE SAME THING YEARS BEFORE AND TO ENDEAVOR TO ESTABLISH THIS BY THE RECOLLECTION OF WITNESSES AS TO EVENTS LONG PAST
THOSE WERE THE DAYS WHEN NO ONE BUILT A NEW EDIFICE FOR STATION PURPOSES
THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF THE FEEDER AND THREE-WIRE INVENTIONS WILL BE APPARENT WHEN IT IS REALIZED THAT WITHOUT THEM IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER ELECTRIC LIGHT COULD BE SOLD TO COMPETE WITH LOW-PRICED GAS ON ACCOUNT OF THE LARGE INVESTMENT IN CONDUCTORS THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY
THE LEVER WHICH THREW THE FORMER FRICTION GEAR INTO ADJUSTMENT WAS MADE TO OPERATE AN IDLER PULLEY FOR TIGHTENING THE AXLE-BELT
MAILLOUX A TRACK AND LOCOMOTIVE WERE CONSTRUCTED FOR THE COMPANY BY MR FIELD AND PUT IN SERVICE IN THE GALLERY OF THE MAIN EXHIBITION BUILDING
WALKER THAT YOUNG EDISON COULD FILL THE POSITION
COMBINATIONS IN ALMOST INFINITE VARIETY INCLUDING GUMS CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS OILS MINERALS AND METALS WERE SUGGESTED BY EDISON
THIS TESTING-TABLE WAS CONNECTED BY MEANS OF WIRES WITH ALL PARTS OF THE LABORATORY AND MACHINE-SHOP SO THAT MEASUREMENTS COULD BE CONVENIENTLY MADE FROM A DISTANCE AS IN THOSE DAYS WE HAD NO PORTABLE AND DIRECT-READING INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS NOW EXIST
IN THE CASE OF THE CRANE TRIAL THERE WAS A REDUCTION FROM 30 PER CENT
PRESCOTT'S ELEMENTS OF THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH A STANDARD WORK IN ITS DAY DESCRIBED A METHOD OF SIMULTANEOUS TRANSMISSION INVENTED BY T
AT 6 A.M
LATER ON HOWEVER HE CHANGED OVER TO A TWO-WIRE CIRCUIT SUCH AS SHOWN IN FIG
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MANY OTHER MEN AND MANY OTHER INVENTIONS HAVE BEEN NEEDED FOR THE PERFECTION OF THESE ARTS
AND PERMISSION WAS ALWAYS GRANTED
SOME APPRECIATION OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS CASE MAY BE GAINED FROM THE FACT THAT THE ARGUMENT ON ITS FIRST TRIAL EMPLOYED A GREAT MANY DAYS AND THE MINUTES COVERED HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF CLOSELY TYPEWRITTEN MATTER WHILE THE ARGUMENT ON APPEAL REQUIRED EIGHT DAYS AND WAS SET FORTH IN EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY PAGES OF TYPEWRITING
SOLUTION OF POTASSIUM HYDRATE HAVING IN ADDITION A SMALL AMOUNT OF LITHIUM HYDRATE
ANDREWS DETAILED FROM THE CENTRAL STAFF SAYS
THE SUGGESTION TO EMPLOY SUCH AN APPARATUS IN ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS OCCURS AT ONCE AND IT MAY BE NOTED THAT IN ONE INSTANCE THE HEAT OF RAYS OF LIGHT FROM THE REMOTE STAR ARCTURUS GAVE RESULTS

WHAT IS THAT I DON'T KNOW HE SAID AND WE PAID NO ATTENTION
THE ENGLISH CHANNEL IS A HOLY TERROR ALL RIGHT BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME
HE CARRIED IT ALONG FOR YEARS BOTH THESE PAPERS ARE STILL IN PROSPEROUS EXISTENCE PARTICULARLY THE ELECTRICAL WORLD AS THE RECOGNIZED EXPONENT OF ELECTRICAL DEVELOPMENT IN AMERICA WHERE NOW THE PUBLIC SPENDS AS MUCH ANNUALLY FOR ELECTRICITY AS IT DOES FOR DAILY BREAD

IT WOULD HOWEVER BE DENYING THE JUSTICE THAT IS EDISON'S DUE TO OMIT ALL MENTION OF TWO HITHERTO UNNAMED ITEMS IN PARTICULAR THAT HAVE ADDED TO THE WORLD'S STORE OF USEFUL DEVICES
BUT AS THE CONDITIONS CREATING HIM CEASED TO EXIST THE TRAMP OPERATOR ALSO PASSED INTO HISTORY
CLARKE WHO DEVOTED HIMSELF MAINLY TO ENGINEERING MATTERS AND LATER ON ACTED AS CHIEF ENGINEER OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY FOR SOME YEARS
I THOUGHT THAT WAS FINAL AND WOULD END THE MATTER BUT ANOTHER FEDERAL JUDGE OUT IN ST LOUIS DID NOT SUSTAIN IT
HIS RATING WAS THAT OF A PLUG OR INFERIOR OPERATOR
THIS HOWEVER WAS FINALLY ACCOMPLISHED AND IN THE SUMMER OF 1889 THE FIRST MODERN MOTION-PICTURE CAMERA WAS MADE
THE CONCENTRATING WORKS HAD BEEN IN OPERATION AND WE HAD PRODUCED A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF THE BRIQUETTES AND HAD BEEN ABLE TO SELL ONLY A PORTION OF THEM THE IRON MARKET BEING IN SUCH CONDITION THAT BLAST-FURNACES WERE NOT MAKING ANY NEW PURCHASES OF IRON ORE AND WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY TO RECEIVE AND CONSUME THE ORES WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CONTRACTED FOR SO WHAT SALES WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE WERE AT EXTREMELY LOW PRICES MY RECOLLECTION BEING THAT THEY WERE BETWEEN $3.50 AND $3.80 PER TON WHEREAS WHEN THE WORKS HAD STARTED WE HAD HOPED TO OBTAIN $6.00 TO $6.50 PER TON FOR THE BRIQUETTES
IF FOR INSTANCE FIVE PICTURES PER SECOND WERE TAKEN HALF OF THE TIME BEING OCCUPIED IN EXPOSURE AND THE OTHER HALF IN MOVING THE EXPOSED PORTION OF THE FILM OUT OF THE FIELD OF THE LENS AND BRINGING A NEW PORTION INTO ITS PLACE AND THE SAME RATIO IS OBSERVED IN EXHIBITING THE PICTURES THE INTERVAL OF TIME BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE PICTURES WOULD BE ONE-TENTH OF A SECOND
JOHNSON HAD HAD A FEW EDISON LAMPS IN LONDON LIT UP FROM PRIMARY BATTERIES AS A DEMONSTRATION
AND ALSO TO NOTE THE INTERESTING VARIETY OF TRADES REPRESENTED IN THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS IN WHICH ARE INCLUDED CHEMISTS ELECTRICIANS ELECTRICAL MECHANICIANS MACHINISTS MECHANICS PATTERN-MAKERS CARPENTERS CABINET-MAKERS VARNISHERS JAPANNERS TOOL-MAKERS LAPIDARIES WAX EXPERTS PHOTOGRAPHIC DEVELOPERS AND PRINTERS OPTICIANS ELECTROPLATERS FURNACEMEN AND OTHERS TOGETHER WITH FACTORY EXPERIMENTERS AND A HOST OF GENERAL EMPLOYEES WHO BY CAREFUL TRAINING HAVE BECOME SPECIALISTS AND EXPERTS IN NUMEROUS BRANCHES OF THESE INDUSTRIES
IT HAD MANY MECHANICAL DEFECTS WHICH PREVENTED ITS USE AS A PRACTICAL APPARATUS
EACH WHEEL OF THE LOCOMOTIVE HAD A METAL RIM AND A CENTRE WEB OF WOOD OR PAPIER-MACHE AND THE CURRENT PICKED UP BY ONE SET OF WHEELS WAS CARRIED THROUGH CONTACT BRUSHES AND A BRASS HUB TO THE MOTOR
I WAS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE LAID IN ANOTHER STOCK OF MORPHINE TO KEEP HIM AT THE LABORATORY
SUDDENLY THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN WITH GREAT VIOLENCE DISLODGING IT FROM ONE OF THE HINGES
HE WOULD LISTEN STROKE HIS BEARD AND SAY NOTHING
AN INTIMATION OF SOME OF THE TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS MACHINE HAS ALREADY BEEN GIVEN IN PRECEDING PAGES HENCE WE SHALL NOT NOW ENLARGE ON THE SUBJECT EXCEPT TO NOTE IN PASSING THAT THE TERRIBLY DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF THE SPARK OF SELF-INDUCTION AND THE ARCING FOLLOWING IT WERE FIRST MANIFESTED IN THIS POWERFUL MACHINE BUT WERE FINALLY OVERCOME BY EDISON AFTER A STRENUOUS APPLICATION OF HIS POWERS TO THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM
FOR THIS REASON THE USE OF CARBON FILAMENTS ONE-SIXTY-FOURTH OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER OR LESS INSTEAD OF CARBON BURNERS ONE THIRTY-SECOND OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER OR MORE NOT ONLY WORKED AN ENORMOUS ECONOMY IN CONDUCTORS BUT ALSO NECESSITATED A GREAT CHANGE IN GENERATORS AND DID BOTH ACCORDING TO A PHILOSOPHY WHICH EDISON WAS THE FIRST TO KNOW AND WHICH IS STATED IN THIS PARAGRAPH IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM AND ASPECT AND WHICH LIES AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTING OF THE WORLD NO SOONER HAD THE TRUTH OF THIS NEW PRINCIPLE BEEN ESTABLISHED THAN THE WORK TO ESTABLISH IT FIRMLY AND COMMERCIALLY WAS CARRIED ON MORE ASSIDUOUSLY THAN EVER
THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF THESE ENTERPRISES IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED AND FORGOTTEN
A NUMBER OF CONTUMELIOUSLY DEFIANT INFRINGERS IN VARIOUS CITIES BASED FOND HOPES OF IMMUNITY UPON THE SUCCESS OF THIS GOEBEL EVIDENCE BUT WERE DEFEATED
SHUNT AND SERIES FIELD-WINDINGS WERE ADDED TO THE MOTOR AND THE SERIES WINDINGS COULD BE PLUGGED IN AND OUT OF CIRCUIT AS DESIRED

HIS MEMORY WAS PRODIGIOUS CONVERSATION LACONIC AND MOVEMENTS RAPID
THE FEEDERS MIGHT BE OPERATED AT ANY DESIRED PERCENTAGE OF LOSS THAT WOULD REALIZE ECONOMY IN COPPER SO LONG AS THEY DELIVERED CURRENT TO THE MAIN CONDUCTORS AT THE POTENTIAL REPRESENTED BY THE AVERAGE VOLTAGE OF THE LAMPS
THE NAME IS DERIVED FROM THE GREEK THE USE OF THE APPARATUS BEING PRIMARILY TO MEASURE EXTREMELY MINUTE DIFFERENCES OF PRESSURE
AND HE WOULD REITERATE HIS FIRST STATEMENT THAT IT WOULD MAKE ONE THOUSAND BARRELS IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
BUT THE INTEREST OF THE MAN IN THE THING NEVER DIES OUT
THERE IS THIS DIFFERENCE HOWEVER
PROFESSOR BELL ALSO SUGGESTED HOW THIS COULD BE DONE BY THE EMPLOY OF A MAN IN EACH CENTRAL OFFICE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONNECTING THE WIRES AS DIRECTED HE ALSO INDICATED THE TWO METHODS OF TELEPHONIC TARIFF--A FIXED RENTAL AND A TOLL
THE PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT WE MADE WAS DROPPED BECAUSE WE WENT INTO OTHER THINGS
IN CASES OF SUCH PERPLEXITY AS THIS GENERALLY SOME INCIDENTS APPEAR THAT SPEAK MORE UNERRINGLY THAN DO THE TONGUES OF THE WITNESSES AND TO SOME OF THESE I PURPOSE TO NOW REFER MR BERNARD SHAW THE DISTINGUISHED ENGLISH AUTHOR HAS GIVEN A MOST VIVID AND AMUSING PICTURE OF THIS INTRODUCTION OF EDISON'S TELEPHONE INTO ENGLAND DESCRIBING THE APPARATUS AS A MUCH TOO INGENIOUS INVENTION BEING NOTHING LESS THAN A TELEPHONE OF SUCH STENTORIAN EFFICIENCY THAT IT BELLOWED YOUR MOST PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS ALL OVER THE HOUSE INSTEAD OF WHISPERING THEM WITH SOME SORT OF DISCRETION SHAW AS A YOUNG MAN WAS EMPLOYED BY THE EDISON TELEPHONE COMPANY AND WAS VERY MUCH ALIVE TO HIS SURROUNDINGS OFTEN ASSISTING IN PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE APPARATUS IN A MANNER WHICH I AM PERSUADED LAID THE FOUNDATION OF MR EDISON'S REPUTATION THE SKETCH OF THE MEN SENT OVER FROM AMERICA IS GRAPHIC
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE SUBSTANCE WATER THAT FORMS THE CRYSTALS KNOWN AS ICE
E THIS EARLY SHOP AFFORDS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE MANNER IN WHICH EDISON HAS MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON THE PERSONNEL OF THE ELECTRICAL ARTS
I MIGHT ALMOST SAY HEART-BREAKING TOO FOR OF ALL THE ELUSIVE DISAPPOINTING THINGS ONE EVER HUNTED FOR THAT WAS THE WORST
AT THE TIME HE TOOK UP THE MATTER HOWEVER NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE REALIZED THE FULL MEANING OF THE TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS INVOLVED
FRANKLIN'S ARRIVAL IN PHILADELPHIA FINDS ITS PARALLEL IN THE VERY MODEST DEBUT OF ADAMS'S FRIEND IN BOSTON
THE DANGERS OF THE EXPEDITION WERE PICTURED TO HIM IN GLOWING COLORS BUT SPURNING PROPHECIES OF DIRE DISASTER HE ENGAGED SOME NATIVE INDIANS AND A CANOE AND STARTED ON HIS EXPLORATIONS REACHING QUITO IN EIGHTY-SEVEN DAYS AFTER A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE COUNTRY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE NAPO RIVER

ONE ASKED ME WHAT I HAD
IN A FEW YEARS HOWEVER THE TELEPHONE SPRANG INTO VIGOROUS EXISTENCE DATING FROM 1876 DRAWING OFF SOME OF THE MOST ADVENTUROUS SPIRITS FROM THE TELEGRAPH FIELD
1 AND BATTERY WERE PLACED ON INSULATED STANDS
AFTER A GREAT AMOUNT OF WORK AND EXPERIMENTATION HE DECIDED UPON A CERTAIN FORM OF GRAPHITE WHICH SEEMED TO BE SUITABLE FOR THE PURPOSE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO THE COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURE OF THE BATTERY AT A SPECIAL FACTORY IN GLEN RIDGE NEW JERSEY INSTALLED FOR THE PURPOSE
THE FIRST TIME I SAW LORD KELVIN HE CAME TO MY LABORATORY AT MENLO PARK IN 1876 HE REPORTED MOST FAVORABLY ON EDISON'S AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH SYSTEM AT THE PHILADELPHIA EXPOSITION OF 1876 I WAS THEN EXPERIMENTING WITH SENDING EIGHT MESSAGES SIMULTANEOUSLY OVER A WIRE BY MEANS OF SYNCHRONIZING TUNING-FORKS
FIRST--TO CONCEIVE A BROAD AND FUNDAMENTALLY CORRECT METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING THE CURRENT SATISFACTORY IN A SCIENTIFIC SENSE AND PRACTICAL COMMERCIALLY IN ITS EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY
THIS LATTER DESERVES SPECIAL MENTION NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF ITS ARRANGEMENT FOR THOROUGH LUBRICATION BUT ALSO ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESULTANT ECONOMY AFFECTING THE COST OF MANUFACTURE

THIS HAPPENED ON A SATURDAY
AND IN THE SUMMER OF 1880 SWAN HAD HAD A FEW SERIES LAMPS BURNING IN LONDON
SOON AFTER THE BUSINESS HAD GROWN SO LARGE THAT E
FROM THE INCEPTION OF THIS BUSINESS THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY AND RAPID DEVELOPMENT RESULTING IN THE PRODUCTION OF A GRAND TOTAL OF OVER 7,300,000 BARRELS OF CEMENT UP TO THE PRESENT DATE HAVING A VALUE OF ABOUT $6,000,000 EXCLUSIVE OF PACKAGE
CHAPTER XX EDISON PORTLAND CEMENT NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN MORE STRIKING THAN THE GENERAL ADOPTION OF CEMENT FOR STRUCTURAL PURPOSES OF ALL KINDS IN THE UNITED STATES
AFTER A YEAR OR SO BERGMANN GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO START A SMALL SHOP IN WOOSTER STREET NEW YORK AND IT WAS AT THIS SHOP THAT THE FIRST PHONOGRAPHS WERE MADE FOR SALE
19 1874 180,858 DUPLEX TELEGRAPHS
SAYS EDISON ON THIS POINT
HE CALLED ME INTO HIS OFFICE AND SAID
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY ANY MORE HAVING TAKEN A SOMEWHAT SUPERFICIAL SURVEY OF THE GREAT ENTERPRISE UNDER CONSIDERATION
IT IS CONTEMPLATED THAT THESE HOUSES SHALL BE BUILT IN INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY CAN BE PUT UP IN GROUPS OF SEVERAL HUNDRED
THIS BATCH OF MATERIAL GOES BACK FOR ANOTHER CRUSHING SO THAT EVERYTHING IS SUBJECTED TO AN EQUALITY OF REFINING
AND THE BUILDING HARDLY EVER CLOSED ITS DOORS TILL MIDNIGHT
I SIGNED AND I NEVER GOT A CENT BECAUSE THERE WAS A CLAUSE IN IT WHICH PREVENTED ME FROM EVER GETTING ANYTHING A CERTAIN EASY-GOING BELIEF IN HUMAN NATURE AND EVEN A CERTAIN CARELESSNESS OF ATTITUDE TOWARD BUSINESS AFFAIRS ARE HERE REVEALED
BUT ALMOST EVERYTHING HAS TROUBLE CONNECTED WITH IT
THE MODERN MEGAPHONE NOW EMPLOYS THE RECEIVER FORM THUS INTRODUCED AS ITS VERY EFFECTIVE TRANSMITTER WITH WHICH THE OLD-FASHIONED SPEAKING-TRUMPET CANNOT POSSIBLY COMPETE
12 1884 391,596 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP SEPT
BY THE APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES THE INEVITABLE BUT USELESS LOSS OR DROP REQUIRED BY ECONOMY MIGHT BE INCURRED BUT WAS LOCALIZED IN THE FEEDERS WHERE IT WOULD NOT AFFECT THE UNIFORMITY OF ILLUMINATION OF THE LAMPS IN ANY OF THE CIRCUITS WHETHER NEAR TO OR REMOTE FROM THE STATION BECAUSE ANY VARIATIONS OF LOSS IN THE FEEDERS WOULD NOT GIVE RISE TO SIMILAR FLUCTUATIONS IN ANY LAMP CIRCUIT
ONE OF THE EARLIEST STORIES ABOUT HIS BOYHOOD RELATES TO THE INCIDENT WHEN HE INDUCED A LAD EMPLOYED IN THE FAMILY TO SWALLOW A LARGE QUANTITY OF SEIDLITZ POWDERS IN THE BELIEF THAT THE GASES GENERATED WOULD ENABLE HIM TO FLY
THERE WAS A PRIVATE ARRANGEMENT IN WRITING WITH MR GOULD THAT HE WAS TO RECEIVE ONE-TENTH OF THE RESULT TO THE AUTOMATIC GROUP AND A TENTH OF THE FURTHER RESULTS SECURED AT HOME AND ABROAD
CHINNOCK HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE GETTING THE CUSTOMERS STRAIGHTENED OUT
19 1882 273,485 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
EDISON'S TASIMETER THIS INTERESTING AND REMARKABLE DEVICE IS ONE OF EDISON'S MANY INVENTIONS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE CHIEFLY BECAUSE THE RANGE OF ITS APPLICATION HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF SCIENCE
THE OBJECT OF THE INVENTION WAS TO PROVIDE FOR INCREASED ECONOMY IN THE QUANTITY OF COPPER EMPLOYED FOR THE MAIN CONDUCTORS IN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER INSTALLATIONS OF CONSIDERABLE EXTENT AT THE SAME TIME PRESERVING SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF EACH LAMP MOTOR OR OTHER TRANSLATING DEVICE UPON ANY ONE OF THE VARIOUS DISTRIBUTION CIRCUITS
THE GIANT ROLLS DESCRIBED BY EDISON IN THE ABOVE-NAMED PATENT AS HAVING BEEN BUILT AND OPERATED BY HIM HAD A COMBINED WEIGHT OF 167,000 POUNDS INCLUDING ALL MOVING PARTS WHICH OF THEMSELVES WEIGHED ABOUT SEVENTY TONS EACH ROLL BEING SIX FEET IN DIAMETER AND FIVE FEET LONG
IN THE MOST LUCID AND EVEN FASCINATING WAY HE DISCUSSES ALL THE PARTS OF THIS MACHINE COMPARES IT WITH THE OTHERS DRAWS DISTINCTIONS POINTS OUT THE MERITS OF THE ONE IN CONTROVERSY AND THE DEFECTS OF ALL THE OTHERS CONSIDERS THE TWENTY-ODD PATENTS REFERRED TO BY OSBORN AND IN THE POLITEST BUT NEATEST MANNER IMAGINABLE SHOWS THAT EXPERT OSBORN DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT AND SUMS THE WHOLE MATTER UP BY DECLARING THIS INVENTION OF MR SCHRADER'S AS EMBODIED IN THE PATENT IN SUIT A RADICAL AND WIDE DEPARTURE FROM THE KAHBEL MACHINE ADMITTED ON ALL SIDES TO BE NEAREST PRIOR APPROACH TO IT A DISTINCT AND IMPORTANT ADVANCE IN THE ART OF ENGRAVING GLASSWARE AND GENERALLY A MACHINE FOR THIS PURPOSE WHICH HAS INVOLVED THE EXERCISE OF THE INVENTIVE FACULTY IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE THUS A MORE RADICAL AND IRRECONCILABLE DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN EXPERTS TOUCHING THE SAME THING COULD HARDLY BE FOUND

ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND STRIKING INVESTIGATIONS MADE BY EDISON IN THIS CONNECTION IS WORTHY OF NOTE AND MAY BE RELATED IN HIS OWN WORDS
HE DEMANDED OF THE MAN THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE BUT THE MAN WAS SPEECHLESS
HE COPIED OUT PAINSTAKINGLY THE ENTIRE PAPER IN LONG HAND EMBODYING THE CORRECTIONS AS HE WENT ALONG AND PRESENTED THE RESULT OF HIS WORK THE FOLLOWING MORNING

THE MODEST REMARKS OF MR EDISON AS PRESIDENT
EDISON YOUNG EDISON REMAINED IN LOUISVILLE FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS QUITE A LONG STAY FOR ONE WITH SUCH NOMADIC INSTINCTS
THE WORKMAN WHO GOT THE SKETCH WAS JOHN KRUESI
MANY OF THE EFFECTS I HAVE SHOWN--SPARKS IN UNSUSPECTED PLACES AND OTHER THINGS--HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BEFORE
AFTER THESE TESTS HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME AND SOME THOUSANDS OF CELLS HAD BEEN SOLD AND WERE GIVING SATISFACTORY RESULTS TO THE PURCHASERS THE TEST SHEETS AND EXPERIENCE GATHERED FROM VARIOUS SOURCES POINTED TO THE FACT THAT OCCASIONALLY A CELL HERE AND THERE WOULD SHOW UP AS BEING SHORT IN CAPACITY
TO REMEDY THIS EDISON ADDED AN ATTACHMENT WHICH IS CALLED A FLOATING WEIGHT AND IS SHOWN AT A IN THE ILLUSTRATION ABOVE
1 LIGHT BEING BETTER AND CHEAPER THAN GAS AND ABSOLUTELY SAFE AS TO FIRE THE FIRST STEAM-YACHT LIGHTED BY INCANDESCENT LAMPS WAS JAMES GORDON BENNETT'S NAMOUNA EQUIPPED EARLY IN 1882 WITH A PLANT FOR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY LAMPS OF EIGHT CANDLEPOWER WHICH REMAINED IN USE THERE MANY YEARS AFTERWARD
IF YOU ARE A MAN YOU CAN'T HURT ME
WE KNEW INSTANTLY WHICH LAMP HAD FAILED AND BATCHELOR REPLACED THAT BY A GOOD ONE HAVING A FEW IN RESERVE NEAR BY
NOT ONLY SO BUT I BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE WIRES WILL UNITE THE HEAD OFFICES OF TELEPHONE COMPANIES IN DIFFERENT CITIES
FOR IF THEY HAVE NO ACTUAL MISSION OF INQUIRY THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE OF A GOOD STORY BEING SECURED OFFHAND
THIS IS THE ONLY INSTANCE SHOWING ANY INDICATION OF IMPATIENCE THAT THE AUTHORS HAVE FOUND IN LOOKING THROUGH THE ENORMOUS MASS OF LABORATORY NOTES
TO A VISITOR COMING ON THE FLOOR OF SUCH A THEATRE FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE IS A SENSE OF CONFUSION IN BEHOLDING THE HETEROGENEOUS SETS OF SCENERY AND THE MOTLEY ASSEMBLAGE OF CHARACTERS REPRESENTED IN THE VARIOUS PLAYS IN THE PROCESS OF TAKING OR REHEARSAL
THE WESTERN UNION THEN PUT THEM ON PRIVATE LINES
THIS METHOD WAS IN SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIAL USE FOR SOME TIME IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES GIVING A SPEED OF FROM THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND WORDS A MINUTE OVER A SINGLE LINE BUT LATER ON WAS SUPERSEDED BY EDISON'S ROMAN LETTER SYSTEM ABOVE REFERRED TO
HE ALSO EXPECTED TO REALIZE STILL FURTHER GAINS IN ECONOMY FROM THE USE OF A LARGE DYNAMO IN PLACE OF SEVERAL SMALL MACHINES BY A MORE THAN CORRESPONDINGLY LOWER ARMATURE RESISTANCE LESS ENERGY FOR MAGNETIZING THE FIELD AND FOR OTHER MINOR REASONS
GETTING ANOTHER BOY WITH DIFFICULTY TO VOLUNTEER HE LAUNCHED OUT ON HIS ERRAND IN THE PITCH-BLACK NIGHT
THIS ACCIDENT DEMONSTRATED THAT SOME OTHER METHOD OF CONNECTING THE ARMATURE WITH THE DRIVEN AXLE SHOULD BE ARRANGED
IF HE MADE LAMP NO
LATER ON MESSRS
BRIEFLY STATED THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BELL'S TELEPHONE AND EDISON'S IS THIS
4 1906 923,633 SHAFT COUPLING SEPT
I WALKED OUT AND TRIED TO FIND THE BOAT
THE FEEDER INVENTION OVERCAME THIS TROUBLE AND MADE IT POSSIBLE TO USE CONDUCTORS ONLY ONE-EIGHTH THE SIZE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THE SAME RESULTS
WHEN THE X-RAY CAME UP I MADE THE FIRST FLUOROSCOPE USING TUNGSTATE OF CALCIUM
8 AND REFER THE READER TO THE ABOVE OR OTHER TEXT-BOOKS IF HE DESIRES TO MAKE A CLOSE STUDY OF ITS INTRICATE OPERATIONS
THEN HE ASKED IF HE COULD HAVE STRYCHNINE
IF IT WILL DO THAT IT WILL DO ANYTHING ELSE I STARTED AT 45 PER CENT
I FOUND THAT THE VERTICAL STYLE WITH EACH LETTER SEPARATE AND WITHOUT ANY FLOURISHES WAS THE MOST RAPID AND THAT THE SMALLER THE LETTER THE GREATER THE RAPIDITY
THE READER WILL UNDOUBTEDLY SEE QUITE CLEARLY FROM THE ABOVE SYSTEM WHICH RESTS UPON VARYING THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT THAT TWO MESSAGES COULD NOT BE SENT IN THE SAME DIRECTION OVER THE ONE LINE AT THE SAME TIME
ON ARRIVAL IN THE EAST HE QUICKLY LEFT THE CITIES BEHIND AND PROCEEDED INTO THE INTERIOR EXTENDING HIS SEARCH FAR INTO THE MORE REMOTE COUNTRY DISTRICTS COLLECTING SPECIMENS ON HIS WAY AND DEVOTING MUCH TIME TO THE STUDY OF THE BAMBOO AND IN ROUGHLY TESTING THE RELATIVE VALUE OF ITS FIBRE IN CANES OF ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND FIVE YEAR GROWTHS
TO MY MIND THE OLD MASTERS ARE NOT ART AND I SUSPECT THAT MANY OTHERS ARE OF THE SAME OPINION
NEEDLESS TO SAY MASTERY OF ITS LITERATURE IS REGARDED BY HIM AS A MOST IMPORTANT PRELIMINARY IN TAKING UP ANY LINE OF INVESTIGATION
BEFORE THE PHOTOGRAPHING OF A SCENE A LONG SERIES OF REHEARSALS TAKES PLACE THE INCIDENTS BEING GONE OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL THE ACTORS ARE LETTER PERFECT SO PERSISTENT ARE THE PRODUCERS IN THE MATTER OF REHEARSALS AND THE REFINING AND ELABORATION OF DETAILS THAT FREQUENTLY A PICTURE THAT MAY BE ACTUALLY PHOTOGRAPHED AND REPRODUCED IN FIFTEEN MINUTES MAY REQUIRE TWO OR THREE WEEKS FOR ITS PRODUCTION

THE RAILWAY COMPANY THEN WENT INTO VOLUNTARY DISSOLUTION A SAD EXAMPLE OF FAILURE TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY AT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MOMENT AND ON THE PART OF THE INVENTOR TO SECURE ANY ADEQUATE RETURN FOR YEARS OF EFFORT AND STRUGGLE IN FOUNDING ONE OF THE GREAT ARTS

EDISON RECEIVED ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO CRITICISE THE DESIGN OR CONSTRUCTION OF THE MACHINE NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT OPEN TO CRITICISM AS I AM NOW AND HAVE BEEN FOR MANY YEARS ENGAGED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF ELECTRIC MACHINES BUT RATHER TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF OBTAINING THE DESCRIBED RESULTS WITHOUT DESTROYING THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION AND CORRELATION OF FORCES
WALLACE AT THIS TIME WAS EXPERIMENTING ON SERIES ARC LIGHTING
NOW THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF COMBINATIONS THAT FORM CRYSTALS AND EVERY ONE OF THEM SAVE ICE SINKS IN WATER

THUS TWO SETS OF MORSE SIGNALS CAN BE TRANSMITTED BY TWO OPERATORS OVER ONE LINE AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH EACH OTHER AND NOT ONLY BETWEEN TERMINAL OFFICES BUT ALSO BETWEEN A TERMINAL OFFICE AND ANY INTERMEDIATE OFFICE OR BETWEEN TWO INTERMEDIATE OFFICES ALONE
THE RESULT WOULD BE THAT THESE CURRENTS WOULD OPPOSE AND NEUTRALIZE EACH OTHER AND THEREFORE NONE WOULD FLOW IN WIRE A
GODDARD AND I HAVE SPENT A PART OF THE DAY AT MENLO AND ALL IS GLORIOUS
SO UNPLEASANT IS THE EFFECT OF THE PRODUCTS OF GAS THAT IN THE NEW MADISON SQUARE THEATRE EVERY GAS JET IS VENTILATED BY SPECIAL TUBES TO CARRY AWAY THE PRODUCTS OF COMBUSTION IN SHORT THERE IS NO ASPECT OF THE NEW PROBLEM TO WHICH EDISON FAILED TO APPLY HIS ACUTEST POWERS
I MADE SUGGESTIONS OF EVERY KIND TO GET AROUND THIS PHENOMENON
SMUGGLERS LANDING LACES AND SILKS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO WIND THEM AROUND THEIR BODIES AS BEING LESS OSTENTATIOUS THAN CARRYING THEM IN A TRUNK
THEY COMPRISED ALSO AN ENTIRE SYSTEM OF CENTRAL STATIONS
POPE LATER EDISON'S PARTNER FOR A TIME
WHILE IT SEEMS A PITY TO DESTROY THIS ERRONEOUS IDEA SUGGESTIVE OF A HEROIC CLIMB FROM THE DEPTHS TO THE HEIGHTS NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH
STIMULATED BY THE EXAMPLE OF HIS UNCLE THIS BRILLIANT YOUTH HAD ALREADY MADE A MARK FOR HIMSELF AS A STUDENT AND INVENTOR AND WHEN ONLY EIGHTEEN HE SECURED IN OPEN COMPETITION THE CONTRACT TO INSTALL A COMPLETE FIRE-ALARM TELEGRAPH SYSTEM FOR PORT HURON
HENCE THE IRON AND STEEL MILLS EAST OF THE ALLEGHANIES--COMPELLED TO RELY ON LIMITED LOCAL DEPOSITS OF BESSEMER ORE AND UPON FOREIGN ORES WHICH WERE CONSTANTLY RISING IN VALUE--BEGAN TO SUSTAIN A SERIOUS COMPETITION WITH WESTERN MILLS EVEN IN EASTERN MARKETS
THE SOUND-WAVES IMPINGING UPON THE DISTANT TRANSMITTER VARIED THE RESISTANCE OF THE CARBON BUTTON THEREIN THUS CAUSING CORRESPONDING VARIATIONS IN THE STRENGTH OF THE BATTERY CURRENT
HE THEN OPENED HIS COAT AND REVEALED THE FACT THAT HE HAD NOTHING BUT THE BARE SKIN
IN A LAWSUIT IN WHICH I WAS A WITNESS I WENT OUT TO LUNCH WITH THE LAWYERS ON BOTH SIDES AND THE LAWYER WHO HAD BEEN CROSS-EXAMINING ME STATED THAT HE HAD FOR A CLIENT A FIFTH AVENUE TAILOR WHO HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD MADE ALL OF MR EDISON'S CLOTHES FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM

ANOTHER STORY MAY ALSO BE INTERPOLATED HERE AS TO THE UNDERGROUND WORK DONE IN NEW YORK FOR THE FIRST EDISON STATION
A GREAT MANY TELEGRAMS WERE SENT AND RECEIVED WHILE THE TRAIN WAS AT FULL SPEED INCLUDING A DESPATCH TO THE CABLE KING JOHN PENDER
I VISITED ALL THE THINGS OF INTEREST IN BERLIN
AND THERE IS NOTHING IN SIGHT BY WAY OF MEMORIAL TO SUGGEST THAT FOR NEARLY A DECADE THIS SPOT WAS THE SCENE OF THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND FRUITFUL INVENTIVE ACTIVITY THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN
HE WANTED SOME KIND OF A JOB TO KEEP HIS MIND OFF WALL STREET
AND THE KNOWLEDGE THUS GAINED WAS EMBODIED IN INSURANCE RULES TO GOVERN WIRING FOR ELECTRIC LIGHTS FORMULATED DURING THE LATTER PART OF 1881 ADOPTED BY THE NEW YORK BOARD OF FIRE UNDERWRITERS JANUARY 12 1882 AND SUBSEQUENTLY ENDORSED BY OTHER BOARDS IN THE VARIOUS INSURANCE DISTRICTS
BUT IT IS NOT DEEMED NECESSARY TO ENTER INTO ITS DETAILS
19 1881 248,433 VACUUM APPARATUS JAN
TO THIS UNFRUITFUL PERIOD BELONGED HOWEVER THE CRUDE IDEA OF TAKING THE CURRENT FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE OF POWER BY MEANS OF AN OVERHEAD CONTACT WHICH HAS FOUND ITS PRACTICAL EVOLUTION IN THE MODERN UBIQUITOUS TROLLEY
A SHORT TIME AFTER THAT A SYNDICATE TOOK UP A MAN NAMED GOEBEL AND TRIED TO DO THE SAME THING BUT AGAIN OUR DETECTIVE-WORK WAS TOO MUCH FOR THEM
AFTER MAKING TWO OR THREE SHOTS I MISSED AND A LONG CAROM SHOT WAS LEFT FOR MR EDISON THE CUE BALL AND OBJECT BALL BEING WITHIN ABOUT TWELVE INCHES OF EACH OTHER AND THE OTHER BALL A DISTANCE OF NEARLY THE LENGTH OF THE TABLE
THERE WAS NO NARROWNESS IN HIS VIEWS IN DESIGNING THESE BUILDINGS BUT ON THE CONTRARY GREAT FAITH IN THE FUTURE FOR HIS PLANS INCLUDED NOT ONLY THE PHONOGRAPH INDUSTRY BUT PROVIDED ALSO FOR THE COMING DEVELOPMENT OF MOTION PICTURES AND OF THE PRIMARY AND STORAGE BATTERY ENTERPRISES
CLARKE ALONG WITH THAT OF THOMAS A
ALL THE PAPERS HAD DISAPPEARED HOWEVER AND WHAT HE HAD EVIDENTLY DONE WAS TO SELL THEM TO OTHERS WHO HAD SIGNED NEW APPLICATIONS AND PROCEEDED TO TAKE OUT PATENTS THEMSELVES ON MY INVENTIONS
3 1880 263,878 ELECTRIC LAMP
I BELIEVE THAT MR EDISON'S SUCCESS AS AN EXPERIMENTER WAS TO A LARGE EXTENT DUE TO THIS HAPPY VIEW OF ALL EXPERIMENTS EDISON HAS FREQUENTLY REMARKED THAT OUT OF A HUNDRED EXPERIMENTS HE DOES NOT EXPECT MORE THAN ONE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND AS TO THAT ONE HE IS ALWAYS SUSPICIOUS UNTIL FREQUENT REPETITION HAS VERIFIED THE ORIGINAL RESULTS
IF THERE IS ONE THING MODERN GERMANY IS PROUD AND JEALOUS OF IT IS HER LEADERSHIP IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND INVESTIGATION
WHILE IN PARIS IN 1889 HE WORE THE DECORATION OF THE LEGION OF HONOR WHENEVER OCCASION REQUIRED BUT AT ALL OTHER TIMES TURNED THE BADGE UNDER HIS LAPEL BECAUSE HE HATED TO HAVE FELLOW-AMERICANS THINK HE WAS SHOWING OFF AND ANY ONE WHO KNOWS EDISON WILL BEAR TESTIMONY TO HIS UTTER ABSENCE OF OSTENTATION
THE SAME LOOSE METHODS APPLIED TO THE EARLY ATTEMPTS TO USE ELECTRIC MOTORS ON ARC-LIGHTING CIRCUITS AND CONTRACTS WERE MADE BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE MOTOR THE WIDTH OF THE CONNECTING BELT OR THE AMOUNT OF POWER THE CUSTOMER THOUGHT HE USED--NEVER ON THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY FURNISHED HIM
WHO IS HE IT HAS CERTAINLY REQUIRED GREAT BODILY VIGOR AND PHYSICAL CAPACITY TO SUSTAIN SUCH FATIGUE AS EDISON HAS ALL HIS LIFE IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF TO THE EXTENT ON ONE OCCASION OF GOING FIVE DAYS WITHOUT SLEEP
19 LIKE ENGLAND'S DRUMBEAT THE VOICE OF THE EDISON PHONOGRAPH IS HEARD AROUND THE WORLD IN UNDYING STRAINS THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
THE ENGINEERING FORCE HAS A GREAT RESPECT FOR THE ACCURACY OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF EVERY PART OF THE PLANT FOR HE REMEMBERS THE DIMENSIONS AND DETAILS OF EACH ITEM OF MACHINERY SOMETIMES TO THE DISCOMFITURE OF THOSE WHO ARE AROUND IT EVERY DAY

WE COULD THUS TAKE CARE OF A SNOW-STORM BY DIMINISHING THE BULK OF MATERIAL TO BE HANDLED
EVEN THE EXPERIMENTAL WORK IMPOSES NO SLIGHT BURDEN ON IT
AT THE TIME EDISON WAS DOING THIS WORK ON ECONOMIZING IN CONDUCTORS MUCH OF THE CRITICISM AGAINST HIM WAS BASED ON THE ASSUMED EXTRAVAGANT USE OF COPPER IMPLIED IN THE OBVIOUS TREE SYSTEM AND IT WAS VERY NATURALLY SAID THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH COPPER IN THE WORLD TO SUPPLY HIS DEMANDS
A GREAT VARIETY OF LAMPS WAS MADE OF THE PLATINUM-IRIDIUM TYPE MOSTLY WITH THERMAL DEVICES TO REGULATE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BURNER AND PREVENT ITS BEING MELTED BY AN EXCESS OF CURRENT
I CAN TALK TO TWO OR THREE PERSONS
DURING THE PROSECUTION OF THE SUITS IN 1893 IT TRANSPIRED THAT THE GOEBEL CLAIMS HAD ALSO BEEN INVESTIGATED BY THE COUNSEL OF THE DEFENDANT COMPANY IN THE PRINCIPAL LITIGATION ALREADY RELATED BUT ALTHOUGH EVERY CONCEIVABLE DEFENCE AND ANTICIPATION HAD BEEN DRAGGED INTO THE CASE DURING THE MANY YEARS OF ITS PROGRESS THE ALLEGED GOEBEL ANTICIPATION WAS NOT EVEN TOUCHED UPON THEREIN
INDEED HIS EXPERIMENTS HAD LED HIM SO FAR AS TO ANTICIPATE IN 1875 WHAT ARE NOW KNOWN AS FLAMING ARCS THE EXCEEDINGLY BRIGHT AND GENERALLY ORANGE OR ROSE-COLORED LIGHTS WHICH HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND ARE NOW SO FREQUENTLY SEEN IN STREETS AND PUBLIC PLACES
DID YOU EVER REALIZE THAT PRACTICALLY ALL INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY IS COLLOIDAL IN ITS NATURE
EDISON'S CONVICTIONS WERE STRONG HOWEVER AND HE PERSISTED
WHEN SOME OF THE BILLS FELL DUE AND I COULDN'T DELIVER TICKERS TO GET A SUPPLY OF MONEY I GAVE A NOTE
IN THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWED HE SUGGESTED SEVERAL KINDS OF WORK WHICH HE HAD IN HIS MIND AND WHICH MIGHT PROVE PROFITABLE
21 1873 139,129 PRINTING TELEGRAPHS
BUT WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS HE DECIDED TO RETIRE FROM THAT FIELD SO FAR AS NEW INVENTIONS WERE CONCERNED AND TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENT IN THE LEISURE HOURS THAT MIGHT REMAIN AFTER CONTINUING TO IMPROVE HIS EXISTING DEVICES
ONE OF THE BEST SPECIMENS TESTED DURING THE ENTIRE TRIP AROUND THE WORLD WAS FOUND FIRST IN CEYLON ALTHOUGH LATER IN BURMAH IT BEING INDIGENOUS TO THE LATTER COUNTRY
IT WAS ALSO ASSERTED THAT THE FILING OF THE GRAY CAVEAT ANTEDATED BY A FEW HOURS THE FILING OF THE BELL APPLICATION
THE COW AND THE PIG HAVE GONE AND THE HORSE IS STILL MORE UNDESIRABLE
HIS QUESTIONS WERE SO CEASELESS AND INNUMERABLE THAT THE PENETRATING CURIOSITY OF AN UNUSUALLY STRONG MIND WAS REGARDED AS DEFICIENCY IN POWERS OF COMPREHENSION AND THE FATHER HIMSELF A MAN OF NO MEAN INGENUITY AND ABILITY REPORTS THAT THE CHILD ALTHOUGH CAPABLE OF REDUCING HIM TO EXHAUSTION BY ENDLESS INQUIRIES WAS OFTEN SPOKEN OF AS RATHER WANTING IN ORDINARY ACUMEN
SEVERAL YEARS LATER THIS SAME MAN ATTEMPTED TO DEFRAUD A LEADING FIRM OF MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS IN NEW YORK AND WAS SENT TO STATE PRISON
I HAD GIVEN THE BOY CONSIDERABLE IODIDE OF POTASSIUM TO PREVENT SALIVATION BUT IT DID NO GOOD IN THIS CASE
MISCELLANEOUS INVENTIONS XXIV
IT HAD BRIGHT BRASS BANDS ALL OVER THE WOODWORK BEAUTIFULLY PAINTED AND EVERYTHING HIGHLY POLISHED WHICH WAS THE CUSTOM UP TO THE TIME OLD COMMODORE VANDERBILT STOPPED IT ON HIS ROADS
TOWARD THE LATTER PART OF 1875 IN THE NEWARK SHOP I INVENTED A DEVICE FOR MULTIPLYING COPIES OF LETTERS WHICH I SOLD TO MR A
I HAD CAUSED A PRINTER'S COMPOSING CASE TO BE SET UP WITH THE IDEA THAT IF WE COULD GET EDITORS AND PUBLISHERS IN TO SEE IT WE SHOULD SHOW THEM THE ADVANTAGES OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
LONGITUDINAL EXPANSION AND THRUST WERE ALSO IMPORTANT FACTORS TO BE PROVIDED FOR AS WELL AS SPECIAL DEVICES TO PREVENT THE PACKING OF THE MASS OF MATERIAL AS IT PASSED IN AND OUT OF THE KILN
SUCH AN APPARATUS WAS NECESSARILY UNDEVELOPED AND WAS INTERESTING ONLY FROM A SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE PROPERTY WAS A SMALL BUILDING IN WHICH LAMPBLACK WAS CRUDELY BUT CAREFULLY MANUFACTURED AND PRESSED INTO VERY SMALL CAKES FOR USE IN THE EDISON CARBON TRANSMITTERS OF THAT TIME
IT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO ANY INSTRUMENT USING TWO INDEPENDENTLY MOVING TYPE-WHEELS
REFERENCE TO THE FOLLOWING DIAGRAMS WILL ELUCIDATE THIS PRINCIPLE MORE CLEARLY THAN WORDS ALONE CAN DO
WE HAD NEVER DECLARED A DIVIDEND WHEN CUTTING BOUGHT HIS SHARES AND AFTER GETTING HIS DIVIDENDS FOR THREE WEEKS IN SUCCESSION HE CALLED UP ON THE TELEPHONE AND WANTED TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF A CONCERN THIS WAS THAT PAID A WEEKLY DIVIDEND
EXPERIMENTATION WAS INCESSANTLY GOING ON WITH THIS IN VIEW AND IN THE PROCESSES OF EVOLUTION CHANGES WERE MADE HERE AND THERE THAT RESULTED IN A STILL GREATER MEASURE OF PERFECTION
IN THE AGGREGATE THERE ARE TWELVE STRUCTURES INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING OF WHICH SIX ARE OF IMPOSING DIMENSIONS RUNNING FROM 200 FEET LONG BY 50 FEET WIDE TO 440 FEET IN LENGTH BY 115 FEET IN WIDTH ALL THESE LARGER BUILDINGS EXCEPT ONE BEING FIVE STORIES IN HEIGHT
THE RESIDUE ON A 200-MESH SCREEN IS USELESS IF EDISON MEASURED HIS HAPPINESS AS MEN OFTEN DO BY MERELY COMMERCIAL OR PECUNIARY REWARDS OF SUCCESS IT WOULD SEEM ALMOST REDUNDANT TO STATE THAT HE HAS CONTINUED TO MANIFEST AN INTENSE INTEREST IN THE CEMENT PLANT
THE NICKEL FLAKE WHICH IS EDISON'S INGENIOUS SOLUTION OF THE CONDUCTIVITY PROBLEM IS OF ITSELF A MOST INTERESTING PRODUCT INTENSELY PRACTICAL IN ITS APPLICATION AND FASCINATING IN ITS MANUFACTURE
THIS GERMAN WATCHMAKER GOEBEL LOCATED IN THE EAST SIDE OF NEW YORK CITY HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN INTERESTED IN A DESULTORY KIND OF WAY IN SIMPLE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA AND A FEW TRIFLING EXPERIMENTS MADE BY HIM SOME FORTY OR FORTY-FIVE YEARS PREVIOUSLY WERE MAGNIFIED AND DISTORTED INTO BRILLIANT AND ALL-COMPREHENSIVE DISCOVERIES AND INVENTIONS

BUT WHO DARE PROCLAIM THE PROCESS INTRINSICALLY WASTEFUL IF THE LOSSES OCCUR IN THE INITIAL STAGES AND THE ECONOMIES IN ALL THE LATER ONES
HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF AS TEXAS JACK'--JOE CHROMONDO--AND SAID HE WANTED TO SEE EDISON AS HE HAD READ ABOUT ME IN THE NEWSPAPERS
EDISON SUMS UP THIS CHAPTER OF HIS LIFE VERY PITHILY
AT THAT TIME IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE COULD BE SEEN AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER MULTIPLE ARC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM THE OPERATION OF WHICH SEEMED AS SUCCESSFUL TO MY YOUTHFUL MIND AS THE OPERATION OF ONE OF THE LARGE METROPOLITAN SYSTEMS TO-DAY
I EVEN HELPED HIM GET UP TOOLS UNTIL IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS WAS TOO RAPID A PROCESS OF GETTING RID OF MY MONEY AS I HADN'T THE HEART TO CUT THE PRICE WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY FAIR

AND TO CARRY A CURRENT OF LOW PRESSURE THROUGH WIRES WITHOUT LOSS WOULD REQUIRE WIRES OF ENORMOUS SIZE
IN ABOUT HALF A MINUTE THERE WAS A SHARP CONCUSSION AND SADLER SAID
ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT WEIGHT OF THE HEAVY LOAD IN A LONG KILN THERE WOULD RESULT THE FORMATION OF A CONTINUOUS PLASTIC COATING ON THAT PORTION OF THE INNER SURFACE OF THE KILN WHERE TEMPERATURES ARE HIGHEST
THE ARMATURE AND THE CARBON-TIPPED POLES OF THE ELECTROMAGNET FORM PART OF THE LOCAL CIRCUIT
AS A PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATION OF THESE FACTS IT WAS CALCULATED BY PROFESSOR BARKER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AFTER EDISON HAD INVENTED THE INCANDESCENT LAMP THAT IF IT SHOULD COST $100,000 FOR COPPER CONDUCTORS TO SUPPLY CURRENT TO EDISON LAMPS IN A GIVEN AREA IT WOULD COST ABOUT $200,000,000 FOR COPPER CONDUCTORS FOR LIGHTING THE SAME AREA BY LAMPS OF THE EARLIER EXPERIMENTERS--SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS THE LAMP INVENTED BY KONN IN 1875
AN EXAMINATION OF THE NEWSPAPER FILES OF THE YEARS 1888 1889 AND 1890 WILL REVEAL THE GREAT EXCITEMENT CAUSED BY THE BRINGING OUT OF THE NEW PHONOGRAPH AND HOW FREQUENTLY AND SUCCESSFULLY IT WAS EMPLOYED IN PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENTS EITHER FOR THE WHOLE OR PART OF AN EVENING
HOLLAND WHO FOR MANY YEARS HAS BEEN CLOSELY IDENTIFIED WITH THE INVENTOR'S WORK ON THIS CELL THE ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED IN THE ELECTRICAL WORLD NEW YORK APRIL 28 1910
AS THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT BEGAN TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY IN PUBLIC FAVOR THE IMMENSE PROPORTIONS OF THE FUTURE MARKET BECAME SUFFICIENTLY OBVIOUS TO TEMPT UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS TO ENTER THE FIELD AND BECOME MANUFACTURERS
EDISON HOWEVER HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THERE WERE VARIOUS WAYS OF ACCOMPLISHING THE TASK AND HAD DETERMINED THAT THE CURRENT SHOULD BE MEASURED ON THE PREMISES OF EVERY CONSUMER
THE JUDGES LACOMBE AND SHIPMAN IN A LONG OPINION REVIEWED THE FACTS AND THE ART AND SAID INTER ALIA
THIS SHOWS HOW WHISKEY IS THE MORE DANGEROUS OF THE TWO

HERE THEN IS AN INDUSTRY THAT DOUBLED IN FIVE YEARS
IN THIS HE IS AIDED BY THE GREAT POWERS OF A MIND THAT IS ABLE TO FREE ITSELF FROM ABSORBED CONCENTRATION ON THE DETAILS OF ONE PROBLEM AND INSTANTLY TO SHIFT OVER AND BECOME DEEPLY AND INTELLIGENTLY CONCENTRATED IN ANOTHER AND ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ONE
23 1879 227,229 ELECTRIC LIGHTS
WE HAD A PAPER-WEIGHT AT THE TRANSMITTER TO SPEED IT UP AND BY ONE O'CLOCK REACHED THE RIGHT QUOTATION
THEY ARE OVERWHELMINGLY RICH IN BIOGRAPHIC MATERIAL BUT ANALYSIS WOULD BE A PROHIBITIVE TASK FOR ONE PERSON AND PERHAPS INTERESTING ONLY TO TECHNICAL READERS
IT WAS OBSERVED THAT WHEN THE STRIP WAS MOVED VERY RAPIDLY THE VIBRATION OF THE LEVER RESULTED IN THE PRODUCTION OF AN AUDIBLE NOTE
OF THE APPLIED MECHANICAL ENERGY INGENUOUSLY REMARKING
EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
HE EXAMINED THIS AND THEN GAVE IT TO ONE OF HIS ASSISTANTS TELLING HIM TO CUT IT UP AND GET OUT OF IT ALL THE FILAMENTS HE COULD CARBONIZE THEM PUT THEM INTO LAMPS AND TRY THEM
THIS INVOLVED SOME SLIPPING AND CONSEQUENT BURNING OF BELTS
THE WORK OF EDISON ON INCANDESCENT LAMPS DID NOT STOP AT THIS FUNDAMENTAL INVENTION BUT EXTENDED THROUGH MORE THAN EIGHTEEN YEARS OF A MOST INTENSE PORTION OF HIS BUSY LIFE
HENCE THE NET RESULT IS AN EXCESS OF CURRENT EQUAL TO THAT REQUIRED BY TWO LAMPS FLOWING THROUGH THE CENTRAL OR COMPENSATING CONDUCTOR WHICH IS NOW ACTING AS POSITIVE TO GENERATOR G<2S> THE ARROWS SHOW THE ASSUMED DIRECTION OF FLOW OF CURRENT THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM AND THE SMALL FIGURES AT THE ARROW-HEADS THE VOLUME OF THAT CURRENT EXPRESSED IN THE NUMBER OF LAMPS WHICH IT SUPPLIES
HE MAY BE QUOTED AS TO WHAT HAPPENED

HAVING AT LAST OBTAINED APPARENTLY THE PROPER MATERIAL UPON WHICH TO SECURE THE PHOTOGRAPHS THE PROBLEM THEN REMAINED TO DEVISE AN APPARATUS BY MEANS OF WHICH FROM TWENTY TO FORTY PICTURES PER SECOND COULD BE TAKEN
THE FACT WAS THEY HAD DONE THEIR WORK SO WELL THEY MUST NOW DISPERSE TO SHOW THE WORLD WHAT IT WAS AND ASSIST IN ITS INDUSTRIAL EXPLOITATION
THE MAIN LABORATORY WAS A SPACIOUS WOODEN BUILDING OF TWO FLOORS
20 1888 390,462 MAKING CARBON FILAMENTS
THE REMARKABLE SUCCESS OF THOSE EARLY YEARS WAS INDEED ONLY ACHIEVED BY FOLLOWING UP WITH CHINESE EXACTNESS THE MINUTE AND INTIMATE METHODS INSISTED UPON BY EDISON AS TO THE USE OF THE APPARATUS AND DEVICES EMPLOYED
OF USELESS MATERIAL WOULD BE PROHIBITIVE
HE SAID YES I WENT IMMEDIATELY TO APPS ON THE STRAND AND ASKED IF HE HAD A POWERFUL BATTERY
SOME OF MY ASSISTANTS IN THOSE DAYS WERE VERY GREEN IN THE BUSINESS AS I DID NOT CARE WHETHER THEY HAD HAD ANY EXPERIENCE OR NOT
EDISON'S DIVERSIONS IN CINCINNATI WERE CHIEFLY THOSE ALREADY OBSERVED
I MODIFIED AND IMPROVED ON THIS FORM AND HAD A NUMBER OF POLE PIECES PLACED ALL AROUND THE RING WITH A MODIFIED FORM OF ARMATURE WINDING
HE REALIZED AT ONCE THAT THE HEAT GENERATED IN A SOLID CORE WAS A PROLIFIC SOURCE OF LOSS
AFTER WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IN PREVIOUS CHAPTERS IT WILL NOT SEEM SO STRANGE THAT EDISON SHOULD HAVE HUNDREDS OF DORMANT INVENTIONS ON HIS HANDS
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS AND WHEN HE GOT THROUGH AND I HAD COPIED ABOUT THREE COLUMNS I ASKED HIM WHY THOSE CHANGES IF HE READ FROM NOTES
GRIFFIN AN OLD TELEGRAPH FRIEND OF EDISON ACTED AS HIS SECRETARY AND HAD CHARGE OF A VOLUMINOUS AND AMAZING CORRESPONDENCE
NOTWITHSTANDING THESE OBJECTIONS THE ORIGINAL PHONOGRAPH CREATED AS ALREADY REMARKED AN ENORMOUS POPULAR EXCITEMENT AND THE EXHIBITIONS WERE CONSIDERED BY MANY SCEPTICAL PERSONS AS NOTHING MORE THAN CLEVER VENTRILOQUISM
HE WAS NOT SATISFIED THAT THE BATTERY WAS A COMPLETE SUCCESS SO HE SHUT DOWN AND WENT TO EXPERIMENTING ONCE MORE
IT WAS INTENDED MORE ESPECIALLY FOR IMPORTERS AND EXCHANGE BROKERS AND WAS FURNISHED AT A LOWER PRICE THAN THE INDICATOR SERVICE
EVERYTHING IS RED-HOT AND THE AMPERE-METER HAS MADE SEVENTEEN REVOLUTIONS IN 1883 NO SUCH FITTINGS AS FIXTURE INSULATORS WERE KNOWN

IN VIEW OF ITS PRESENT STATUS THIS COLOSSAL ENTERPRISE AT EDISON MAY WELL BE LIKENED TO THE PROLOGUE OF A PLAY THAT IS TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY ENACTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF FUTURE GENERATIONS BUT BEFORE RINGING DOWN THE CURTAIN IT IS DESIRABLE TO PRESERVE THE UNITIES BY QUOTING THE WORDS OF ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL ACTORS MR MALLORY WHO SAYS
THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN
IT WAS TO BE LEFT UNTIL THE MIXTURE WAS HARD AND THE REQUIREMENT OF THE TEST WAS THAT THERE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE UNIFORMITY OF MIXTURE AND MASS THROUGHOUT
HIS CONNECTION WITH MEN PROMINENT IN OFFICIAL LIFE OF WHICH I WAS AWARE WAS SURPRISING TO ME
BUT ALAS
I WOULD TAKE A WIRE WITH SIMILAR APPARATUS AT BOTH ENDS AND WOULD THROW IT OVER ON ONE SET OF INSTRUMENTS TAKE IT AWAY AND GET IT BACK SO QUICKLY THAT YOU WOULD NOT MISS IT THEREBY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE RAPIDITY OF ELECTRICITY TO PERFORM OPERATIONS
ACCORDINGLY MR BRAUNER WAS SENT FOR AND DISPATCHED TO BRAZIL IN DECEMBER 1880 TO SEARCH FOR AND SEND SAMPLES OF THIS AND SUCH OTHER PALMS FIBRES GRASSES AND CANES AS IN HIS JUDGMENT WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR THE EXPERIMENTS THEN BEING CARRIED ON AT MENLO PARK

THE CLOSE OF THE SAME DECADE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT SAW THE ELECTRIC LIGHT BROUGHT TO PERFECTION SAW ALSO THE REALIZATION IN PRACTICE OF ALL THE HOPES OF FIFTY YEARS AS TO ELECTRIC TRACTION
THEN THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE WITH THE LIFE OF THE LAMPS THERE AND HE DISAPPEARED FROM THE OFFICE AND SPENT HIS TIME LARGELY AT MENLO PARK

IN FACT FOR WEEKS TOGETHER IT SEEMED AS THOUGH NO PARISIAN PAPER WAS CONSIDERED COMPLETE AND UP TO DATE WITHOUT AN ARTICLE ON EDISON
ON THE CONTRARY ITS TERRITORIAL BOUNDARIES HAVE BEEN INCREASING STEP BY STEP WITH THE ENLARGEMENT OF ITS LABORS UNTIL NOW IT HAS BEEN OBLIGED TO GO OUTSIDE ITS OWN PROPER DOMAINS TO OCCUPY SOME SPACE IN AND ABOUT THE GREAT EDISON INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS AND SPACE IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT
IT CONSISTED GENERALLY SPEAKING OF AN ELECTROMAGNET WITH RELAYS CONNECTING WITH A RED AND A BLUE LAMP
IT WILL BE QUITE OBVIOUS THEREFORE THAT THE ADVENT OF ANY USEFUL INVENTION OR DISCOVERY GREAT OR SMALL IS FOLLOWED BY A CLASHING OF MANY INTERESTS WHICH BECOME COMPLEX IN THEIR INTERPRETATION BY REASON OF THE MANY CONFLICTING CLAIMS THAT CLUSTER AROUND THE MAIN PRINCIPLE

MR EDISON HAS SPARED NEITHER THOUGHT INGENUITY LABOR NOR MONEY IN THE EFFORT TO MAKE IT THE MOST COMPLETE AND EFFICIENT STORAGE CELL OBTAINABLE AND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT HIS SKILL JUDGMENT AND FORESIGHT HAVE LOST NOTHING OF THE POWER THAT LAID THE FOUNDATION OF AND BUILT UP OTHER GREAT ARTS AT EACH EARLIER STAGE OF HIS CAREER

AND LEST THE READER THINK THAT THE WORD INNUMERABLE MAY HAVE BEEN CARELESSLY OR HASTILY USED ABOVE WE WOULD QUOTE THE REPLY OF ONE OF THE LABORATORY ASSISTANTS WHEN ASKED HOW MANY EXPERIMENTS HAD BEEN MADE ON THE EDISON STORAGE BATTERY SINCE THE YEAR 1900
HE DOESN'T EVEN SUSPECT ANYTHING ONE DAY CHINNOCK CAME TO ME AND SAID
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO ROUSE HIM FROM HIS DESPAIR AND APATHY BUT I TALKED ABOUT THE ELECTRIC LIGHT TO HIM AND ITS DEVELOPMENT AND TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD HELP HIM WIN IT ALL BACK AND PUT HIM IN HIS FORMER POSITION
I HAD OBTAINED FROM THE STATION AGENT A SMALL ROOM AND HAD ESTABLISHED A LITTLE SHOP OF MY OWN
THUS EDISON AND HIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATES HAVE BEEN FORCED INTO A VERITABLE MAELSTROM OF LITIGATION DURING THE MAJOR PART OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS IN THE EFFORT TO PROCURE FOR THEMSELVES A SMALL MEASURE OF PROTECTION FOR THEIR INTERESTS UNDER THE NUMEROUS INVENTIONS OF NOTE THAT HE HAS MADE AT VARIOUS TIMES IN THAT PERIOD
WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT
SUCH A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE WOULD NOT MAKE AN APPRECIABLE VARIATION IN THE CANDLE-POWER OF THE LAMPS
IF THE TALLOW CANDLE HITHERTO UNKNOWN WERE NOW INVENTED ITS CREATOR WOULD BE HAILED AS ONE OF THE GREATEST BENEFACTORS OF THE PRESENT AGE

IT WAS IN THE EVENING AND WE WENT IN BY THE SERVANTS ENTRANCE AS ECKERT PROBABLY FEARED THAT HE WAS WATCHED
AND IN THE LOWER SKETCH SIMILARLY ENLARGED A REPRESENTATION OF THE STYLUS TRAVELLING OVER THE RECORD THUS MADE IN THE ACT OF EFFECTING A REPRODUCTION
THIS WILL WAKE THEM UP EDISON'S EXAMINATIONS ARE NO JOKE ACCORDING TO MR J

IT OCCURRED TO ME ONE DAY THAT BEFORE I WENT TOO FAR WITH MY PLANS I HAD BETTER FIND OUT WHAT REAL ESTATE WAS WORTH
WHEN I REPORTED TO MR EDISON HE SAID
IN NEW YORK THE QUESTION OF PERMANENCY WAS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE AND THE OTHER CONTINGENCIES WERE SURE TO ARISE AS WELL AS CONDITIONS MORE EASY TO IMAGINE THAN TO FORESTALL
THE METER WAS CHEAP TO MANUFACTURE AND INSTALL AND NOT AT ALL LIABLE TO GET OUT OF ORDER
FROM THESE NEGATIVES WHEN DEVELOPED POSITIVE PRINTS WERE MADE WHICH WERE LATER MOUNTED ON A MODIFIED FORM OF ZOETROPE AND PROJECTED UPON A SCREEN
THE MINUTE PROPORTIONS OF THESE DEVICES WILL BE APPARENT BY A GLANCE AT THE ACCOMPANYING ILLUSTRATIONS IN WHICH THE OBJECT ON THE LEFT REPRESENTS A COMMON PIN AND THE OBJECTS ON THE RIGHT THE CUTTING-TOOL AND REPRODUCING STYLUS ALL ACTUAL SIZES
THE PLAN SEEMS TO HAVE HAUNTED HIM AND HE HAD NO SOONER WORKED OUT A GENERATOR AND MOTOR THAT OWING TO THEIR LOW INTERNAL RESISTANCE COULD BE OPERATED EFFICIENTLY THAN HE TURNED HIS HAND TO THE PRACTICAL TRIAL OF SUCH A RAILROAD APPLICABLE TO BOTH THE HAULAGE OF FREIGHT AND THE TRANSPORTATION OF PASSENGERS
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I FELT THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY TO BE EMINENTLY PRACTICAL WAS THAT HENRY VILLARD THE PRESIDENT OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC SAID THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE WOULD BE TO BUILD RIGHT-ANGLE FEEDERS INTO THE WHEAT-FIELDS OF DAKOTA AND BRING IN THE WHEAT TO THE MAIN LINES AS THE FARMERS THEN HAD TO DRAW IT FROM FORTY TO EIGHTY MILES
SOMETHING HAD GOT TO BE DONE
THE FIRST BILL FOR LIGHTING BASED UPON THE READING OF ONE OF THESE METERS AMOUNTED TO $50.40 AND WAS COLLECTED ON JANUARY 18 1883 FROM THE ANSONIA BRASS AND COPPER COMPANY 17 AND 19 CLIFF STREET
THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE ENGLISH RAILROAD OWNING THIS LINE WAS FORBES WHO HEARD I WAS COMING OVER AND PLACED THE PRIVATE SALOON AT MY DISPOSAL
THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE SYSTEM THE POSITIVE SIDE BEING REPRESENTED BY THE CONDUCTORS P AND PN AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE BY THE CONDUCTORS PN AND N
THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THESE GREAT MACHINES LATER ON AND THEIR EXTENSIVE PRACTICAL USE ARE WELL KNOWN AND NEED NO FURTHER COMMENT EXCEPT IN PASSING IT MAY BE NOTED THAT SUBSEQUENT MACHINES HAD EACH A CAPACITY OF 1200 LAMPS OF 16 CANDLE-POWER AND THAT THE ARMATURE RESISTANCE WAS STILL FURTHER REDUCED TO 0.0039 OHM
AND IT WAS IN THIS POSITION THAT MY LONG INTIMACY WITH JOHN KRUESI STARTED AT THIS JUNCTURE A LARGE PART OF THE CORRESPONDENCE REFERRED VERY NATURALLY TO ELECTRIC LIGHTING EMBODYING REQUESTS FOR ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION CATALOGUES PRICES TERMS ETC
SEVEN YEARS LATER JOHN EDISON WHO AS A LOYALIST OR UNITED EMPIRE EMIGRANT HAD BECOME ENTITLED UNDER THE LAWS OF CANADA TO A GRANT OF SIX HUNDRED ACRES OF LAND MOVED WESTWARD TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THIS PROPERTY
WITH THE EVER-INCREASING SIMPLIFICATION AND EFFICIENCY OF THE MACHINE AND A BROADENING OF ITS APPLICATION THE RESULTS OF THIS POLICY WERE MANIFESTED IN A STILL MORE RAPID GROWTH OF THE BUSINESS THAT NECESSITATED FURTHER ADDITIONS TO THE MANUFACTURING PLANT
UP TO THE TIME OF THE EDISON AWARD THREE OTHERS HAD BEEN MADE
14 1874 1875 168,242 TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER FOR AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH
SOME OF THE PRESS NOTICES OF THE PERIOD WERE MOST AMAZING--AND AMUSING
COMMENT IS MADE ON KEROSENE AND ITS COST AND ALL KINDS OF GENERAL STATISTICS ARE JOTTED DOWN AS DESIRABLE
ONE OF THE EXCEPTIONS PROVING THE RULE MAY PERHAPS BE MET IN EDISON THOUGH ALL DEPENDS ON THE POINT OF VIEW
ONE-STORIED WITH ROOMS FINISHED ON THE ATTIC FLOOR
IF WE ASSUME AS LOW A WAGE AS $10 PER WEEK FOR EACH OF THESE HELPERS WE MUST ADD TO THE FOREGOING AN ADDITIONAL SUM OF OVER $17,000,000 PAID ANNUALLY FOR WAGES ALMOST ENTIRELY IN THE ISOLATED INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTING FIELD
THE CONCEPTION OF THE STOCK TICKER DATES FROM THIS INCIDENT MR CALLAHAN'S FIRST IDEA WAS TO DISTRIBUTE GOLD QUOTATIONS AND TO THIS END HE DEVISED AN INDICATOR IT CONSISTED OF TWO DIALS MOUNTED SEPARATELY EACH REVOLVED BY AN ELECTROMAGNET SO THAT THE DESIRED FIGURES WERE BROUGHT TO AN APERTURE IN THE CASE ENCLOSING THE APPARATUS AS IN THE LAWS SYSTEM
IN CEMENT-MAKING GENERALLY SPEAKING CEMENT ROCK AND LIMESTONE IN THE ROUGH ARE MIXED TOGETHER IN SUCH RELATIVE QUANTITIES AS MAY BE DETERMINED UPON IN ADVANCE BY CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
THE FIRST 9000 WORDS WERE TRANSMITTED IN FORTY-FIVE MINUTES
BUT AS THE READER HAS ALREADY LEARNED THE METALLIC FILAMENT WAS SOON LAID ASIDE IN FAVOR OF CARBON AND WE FIND IN THE LABORATORY NOTES AN AMAZING RECORD OF RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED IN THE MINUTE AND SEARCHING MANNER PECULIAR TO EDISON'S METHOD
I REPLIED THAT I THOUGHT HE WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND TOLD HIM TO GET BUSY WITH HIS TALK ON DOTS AND DASHES
APRIL 18 1872 128,131 PRINTING TELEGRAPHS
EARLY IN 1880 WHEN THE TREMENDOUS RUSH OF WORK INVOLVED IN THE INVENTION OF THE INCANDESCENT LAMP INTERMITTED A LITTLE HE BEGAN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A STRETCH OF TRACK CLOSE TO THE MENLO PARK LABORATORY AND AT THE SAME TIME BUILT AN ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE TO OPERATE OVER IT
THE LANGUAGE OF THE CLAIM IS
A VULCANITE OR OTHER STRIP IS EASILY AFFECTED BY DIFFERENCES OF TEMPERATURE EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING BY REASON OF THE MINUTEST CHANGES
BUT BY AN INGENIOUS CLUTCH ARRANGEMENT THE BELT WAS RELEASED AT THE MOMENT OF RESISTANCE IN THE ROLLS BY REASON OF THE ROCKS FALLING BETWEEN THEM
PREECE F.R.S REMARKED
THE STEAM-SHOVEL DID NOT DISCRIMINATE BUT PICKED UP HANDILY SINGLE PIECES WEIGHING FIVE OR SIX TONS AND LOADED THEM ON THE SKIPS WITH QUANTITIES OF SMALLER LUMPS
SO IMPORTANT AN INVENTION AS THE QUADRUPLEX COULD NOT LONG GO BEGGING BUT THERE WERE MANY DIFFICULTIES CONNECTED WITH ITS INTRODUCTION SOME OF WHICH ARE BEST DESCRIBED IN MR EDISON'S OWN WORDS
HE WHISPERED TO THE GENERAL TO PUT HIS HAND ON THE FRAME OF THE MOTOR WATCH THE EXHAUST AND NOTE THE COINCIDENT TREMOR
IT WAS FILED IN THE PATENT OFFICE A FEW DAYS LATER BUT WAS NOT ISSUED AS A PATENT UNTIL AUGUST 30 1887
NO MODERN TELEPHONE SYSTEM IN USE TO-DAY LACKS THESE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES--THE VARYING RESISTANCE AND THE INDUCTION COIL THE PRINCIPLE OF THE ELECTROMOTOGRAPH WAS UTILIZED BY EDISON IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE FIRST OF ALL IN TELEGRAPHY AT THIS JUNCTURE
THEY ALSO BEAR ABUNDANT EVIDENCE OF THE COMPATIBILITY OF THESE TWO WIDELY DIVERGENT GIFTS EXISTING EVEN TO A HIGH DEGREE IN THE SAME PERSON
MORGAN WHOSE FIRM WAS ONE OF THE FIRST CUSTOMERS EXPRESSED TO MR EDISON SOME DOUBT AS TO THE ACCURACY OF THE METER
THESE METALS HAVE VERY HIGH FUSING-POINTS AND WERE FOUND TO LAST LONGER THAN THE CARBON STRIPS PREVIOUSLY USED WHEN HEATED UP TO INCANDESCENCE BY THE ELECTRIC CURRENT ALTHOUGH UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS AS WERE THEN POSSIBLE THEY WERE MELTED BY EXCESS OF CURRENT AFTER THEY HAD BEEN LIGHTED A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME EITHER IN THE OPEN AIR OR IN SUCH A VACUUM AS COULD BE OBTAINED BY MEANS OF THE ORDINARY AIR-PUMP
BUT IF THE SURFACE IS KEPT HARD AND SMOOTH THE EFFECT IS QUITE DIFFERENT
IN THE NEW YORK FIRST DISTRICT THE NEAREST PROPERTY AVAILABLE WAS A DOUBLE BUILDING AT NOS
THIS GREAT AND NOTABLE PLANT REPRESENTING A VERY LARGE OUTLAY OF MONEY BROUGHT TO COMPLETION READY FOR BUSINESS AND EMBRACING SOME OF THE MOST BRILLIANT AND REMARKABLE OF EDISON'S INVENTIONS AND METHODS MUST BE ABANDONED BY FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH HE HAD NO CONTROL AND WITH IT MUST DIE THE HIGH HOPES THAT HIS PROGRESSIVE CONQUERING MARCH TO SUCCESS HAD LEGITIMATELY ENGENDERED
AT HIS COURT STREET WORKSHOP EDISON WAS A FREQUENT VISITOR
DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH EDISON EXHIBITED HIS LIGHTING SYSTEM AT THE PARIS EXPOSITION IN 1881 HIS REPRESENTATIVE MR CHARLES BATCHELOR REPEATED EDISON'S REMARKABLE EXPERIMENTS OF THE WINTER OF 1875 FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GREAT NUMBER OF EUROPEAN SAVANTS USING WITH OTHER APPARATUS THE ORIGINAL DARK BOX WITH MICROMETER ADJUSTMENT THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE AUTHORS TO DETRACT IN THE LEAST DEGREE FROM THE BRILLIANT WORK OF HERTZ BUT ON THE CONTRARY TO ASCRIBE TO HIM THE HONOR THAT IS HIS DUE IN HAVING GIVEN MATHEMATICAL DIRECTION AND CERTAINTY TO SO IMPORTANT A DISCOVERY
IN ADDITION TO THESE TWELVE CONCRETE STRUCTURES THERE ARE A FEW SMALLER BRICK AND WOODEN BUILDINGS ON THE GROUNDS IN WHICH SOME SPECIAL OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED
THE FACTS IN EACH CASE SO FREQUENTLY CREATE AN EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE THAT SUCH RULE MUST BE HONORED RATHER IN ITS BREACH THAN IN ITS OBSERVANCE
JULY 18 1905 950,227 APPARATUS FOR MAKING METALLIC FILMS OR FLAKES
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ECONOMY OF INVESTMENT SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE HIGHLY DESIRABLE BUT CONSIDERED COMMERCIALLY IT IS IMPRACTICABLE BECAUSE THE PRINCIPLE OF INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF EACH UNIT WOULD BE LOST AS THE TURNING OUT OF A LAMP IN ANY SERIES WOULD MEAN THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF ITS COMPANION ALSO
EDISON ALSO TRIED HARD CARBON WOOD CARBONS AND ALMOST EVERY CONCEIVABLE VARIETY OF PAPER CARBON IN LIKE MANNER
THEY CONSTITUTE A CHEAP CLEAN FORM OF AMUSEMENT FOR MANY PERSONS WHO CANNOT SPARE THE MONEY TO GO TO THE ORDINARY THEATRES OR THEY MAY BE EXHIBITED IN TOWNS THAT ARE TOO SMALL TO SUPPORT A THEATRE
EDISON TACKLED THE OBJECTION SQUARELY AND SHORT-CIRCUITED HIS TRACK WITH SUCH A VEHICLE BUT SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ONLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AMPERES THROUGH THE WHEELS THE LOW VOLTAGE AND THE INSULATING PROPERTIES OF THE AXLE-GREASE BEING SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR SUCH A RESULT
BY ROTATING THE CYLINDER AND BY CAUSING THE DIAPHRAGM TO VIBRATE UNDER THE EFFECT OF VOCAL OR MUSICAL SOUNDS THE NEEDLE-LIKE POINT WOULD FORM A SERIES OF INDENTATIONS IN THE FOIL CORRESPONDING TO AND CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SOUND-WAVES
AND THE MACHINE-SHOP IS IN TOTAL DARKNESS
162,633 AND WAS KNOWN AS THE DIPLEX SYSTEM ALTHOUGH IN THE PATENT REFERRED TO EDISON SHOWED AND CLAIMED THE ADAPTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE TO DUPLEX TELEGRAPHY
IF HOWEVER THE OBJECT IS MOVING RAPIDLY ACROSS THE FIELD OF VIEW ONE PICTURE WILL BE SEPARATED FROM ITS SUCCESSOR TO A MARKED EXTENT AND THE RESULTING IMPRESSION WILL BE JERKY AND UNNATURAL
ONE AUGUST MORNING IN 1862 WHILE THE SHUNTING WAS IN PROGRESS AND A LADEN BOX-CAR HAD BEEN PUSHED OUT OF A SIDING EDISON WHO WAS LOITERING ABOUT THE PLATFORM SAW THE LITTLE SON OF THE STATION AGENT MR J
THE OBSERVER WILL BELIEVE THAT HE SEES ONLY ONE IMAGE WHICH CHANGES GRADUALLY BY REASON OF THE SUCCESSIVE CHANGES OF FORM AND POSITION OF THE OBJECTS WHICH OCCUR FROM ONE PICTURE TO THE OTHER
THESE WORKS WERE OWNED BY ME AND MY ASSISTANTS UNTIL SOLD TO THE EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY
THIS WAS BY NO MEANS ALL AND AS A FITTING CLOSE TO THIS CHAPTER HE MAY BE QUOTED AS TO SOME OTHER WORK AND ITS PERILS IN EXPERIMENTATION
6 1879 224.665 AUTOGRAPHIC STENCILS FOR PRINTING
AS REGARDS OUR GETTING ONLY THREE LIGHTS PER HORSE-POWER OUR STATION HAS NOW BEEN RUNNING THREE MONTHS WITHOUT STOPPING A MOMENT DAY OR NIGHT AND WE INVARIABLY GET OVER SIX LAMPS PER HORSE-POWER OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS WE DO IN OUR ISOLATED PLANTS
I WENT OVER TO A BANK IN NEWARK--THE MERCHANTS'--AND TOLD THEM WHAT I WANTED
AND OBVIOUSLY IN A LARGE CITY SUCH A METHOD WOULD SOON BE LIKELY TO RESULT IN FINANCIAL DISASTER TO THE PLANT
I THEN LEARNED THAT HE HAD THUS MADE OVER NINE THOUSAND EXPERIMENTS IN TRYING TO DEVISE THIS NEW TYPE OF STORAGE BATTERY BUT HAD NOT PRODUCED A SINGLE THING THAT PROMISED TO SOLVE THE QUESTION
APRIL 5 1883 354,310 MANUFACTURE OF CARBON CONDUCTORS APRIL 6 1883 370,123 ELECTRIC METER APRIL 6 1883 411,017 CARBONIZING FLASK
BUT THE FACTS RENDER IT EASY TO DISPEL THIS FALSE BELIEF
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT WHEN EDISON WENT BOLDLY OUT INTO NEW TERRITORY AFTER SOMETHING ENTIRELY UNKNOWN HE WAS QUITE PREPARED FOR HARD WORK AND EXPLORATION
IN USING THE WORD STANDARD THEREFORE IT IS INTENDED THAT THE SAME SHALL APPLY TO LAMPS OF ABOUT THAT VOLTAGE AS WELL AS TO ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS OF THE APPROXIMATE POTENTIAL TO OPERATE THEM
SUCH A METHOD OF INVESTIGATING MUST CERTAINLY BE MORE SATISFACTORY TO ONE HONESTLY SEEKING KNOWLEDGE THAN THAT OF FIRST ASSUMING AN ERROR AS THE BASIS OF A QUESTION AND THEN DEMANDING AN EXPLANATION
SO I DID NOT SEND A SUBSTITUTE ANOTHER THUMB-NAIL SKETCH MADE OF ONE OF HIS ASSOCIATES IS THIS
INGENUITY HAS BEEN SHOWN ALSO IN THE INVENTION OF TALKING-MACHINES LIKE FABER'S BASED ON THE REED ORGAN PIPE
THERE MUST ALSO BE MEANS FOR THUS REGULATING AT THE POINT WHERE THE CURRENT WAS GENERATED THE QUALITY OR PRESSURE OF THE CURRENT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE LIGHTING AREA WITH DEVICES FOR INDICATING WHAT SUCH PRESSURE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE AREA
THE REPRODUCING MACHINE OR AS IT IS CALLED IN PRACTICE THE PROJECTING KINETOSCOPE IS QUITE SIMILAR SO FAR AS ITS GENERAL OPERATIONS IN HANDLING THE FILM ARE CONCERNED
OF THE POWER APPLIED TO THIS MACHINE IN EXTERNAL WORK PERHAPS THE WRITER IS A HUMORIST AND HAD IN HIS MIND COLONEL SELLERS ETC WHICH HE COULD NOT KEEP OUT OF A SERIOUS DISCUSSION
HE LOOKED ME OVER AND SAID
THE COMPENSATING RESISTANCES AND CONDENSERS NECESSARY FOR A DUPLEX ARRANGEMENT ARE SHOWN IN THE DIAGRAM
OTT WHO HAS BEEN EDISON'S DESIGNER OF MECHANICAL DEVICES FOR OVER FORTY YEARS
SOON AFTER THE BROCKTON MASSACHUSETTS CENTRAL STATION WAS STARTED IN OPERATION MANY YEARS AGO HE WROTE A NOTE TO MR W
NO THEORY OF EDUCATION THAT AGGRAVATES THIS DANGER IS CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL WELL-BEING EDISON IS SLOW TO DISCUSS THE GREAT MYSTERIES OF LIFE BUT IS OF REVERENTIAL ATTITUDE OF MIND AND EVER TOLERANT OF OTHERS BELIEFS

ECKERT WHO HAD BEEN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF WAR WITH STANTON ECKERT WAS SECRETLY NEGOTIATING WITH GOULD TO LEAVE THE WESTERN UNION AND TAKE CHARGE OF THE ATLANTIC PACIFIC--GOULD'S COMPANY
HERE LURKED HOWEVER VERY VIGOROUS ELEMENTS OF OPPOSITION FOR EDISON PREDICTED FROM THE START THE SUPERIORITY OF THE SMALL ELECTRIC UNIT OF LIGHT AND DEVOTED HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO ITS PERFECTION AND INTRODUCTION
AVALANCHES OF AFFIDAVITS OF HIMSELF HIS SISTERS AND HIS COUSINS AND HIS AUNTS PRACTICALLY ALL PERSONS IN ORDINARY WALKS OF LIFE AND OF OLD FRIENDS CONTRIBUTED A HOST OF RECOLLECTIONS THAT SEEMED LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS IN THEIR DETAILED ACCOUNTS OF EVENTS OF A SCIENTIFIC NATURE THAT WERE SAID TO HAVE OCCURRED SO MANY YEARS BEFORE

FINALLY I MADE HIM A PROMISE THAT I WOULD GO TO HIS COUNTRY HOUSE AT FOOT'S CRAY NEAR LONDON
I DON'T THINK THERE WERE MANY COPIES OF FARADAY'S WORKS SOLD IN THOSE DAYS
AS TO THE RELATIONS OF THAT TIME MR POPE REMARKS
VAIL AND W
AFTER TWO MONTHS OF VERY HARD WORK I GOT A DETAIL AT REGULAR TIMES OF EIGHT OPERATORS AND WE GOT IT WORKING NICELY FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER OVER A WIRE WHICH RAN TO ALBANY AND BACK
THIS APPLICATION MET WITH SOME MERELY MINOR TECHNICAL OBJECTIONS IN THE PATENT OFFICE AND SEEMS TO HAVE PASSED INTO THE ABANDONED CLASS FOR WANT OF PROSECUTION PROBABLY BECAUSE OF BEING OVERLOOKED IN THE TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ARISING FROM HIS DEVELOPMENT OF HIS ELECTRIC-LIGHTING SYSTEM
VIEWED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF INVENTIVE PROGRESS THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HAD PASSED VERY PROFITABLY WHEN EDISON APPEARED--EVERY YEAR MARKED BY SOME NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENT IN THE ARTS AND SCIENCES WITH PROMISE OF ITS EARLY AND ABUNDANT FRUITION IN COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY
UNTIL EDISON MADE HIS WONDERFUL INVENTION IN 1877 THE HUMAN RACE WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT MEANS FOR PRESERVING OR PASSING ON TO POSTERITY ITS OWN LINGUISTIC UTTERANCES OR ANY OTHER VOCAL SOUND
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ALTHOUGH MR EDISON HAS TAKEN NO ACTIVE PART IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MORE MODERN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY AND HIS NAME HAS NOT OCCURRED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH THE UNDERLYING PHENOMENA HAD BEEN NOTED BY HIM MANY YEARS IN ADVANCE OF THE ART AS WILL PRESENTLY BE EXPLAINED
IN THE YEAR 1900 WHEN EDISON UNDERTOOK TO INVENT A STORAGE BATTERY HE DECLARED IT SHOULD BE A NEW TYPE INTO WHICH NEITHER SULPHURIC NOR ANY OTHER ACID SHOULD ENTER
THE LEADING ELECTRICIANS PHYSICISTS AND EXPERTS OF THE PERIOD HAD BEEN STUDYING THE SUBJECT FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AND WITH BUT ONE KNOWN EXCEPTION HAD PROVEN MATHEMATICALLY AND BY CLOSE REASONING THAT THE SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AS IT WAS THEN TERMED WAS PRACTICALLY BEYOND ATTAINMENT
WITH REGARD TO THIS MATTER MR EDISON HIMSELF REMARKS
IN THE MEAN TIME I HAD INTRODUCED THE APPARATUS ON THE LINES OF THE COMPANY WHERE IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL

I WONDERED AT THE TIME HOW IT COULD PAY TO RUN AN OCEAN STEAMER WITH SO FEW PEOPLE
AMONG THE REST HE PUT A PICKEREL INTO A TANK CONTAINING WATER AND SEPARATED ACROSS ITS MIDDLE BY A TRANSPARENT GLASS PLATE AND ON THE OTHER SIDE HE PUT A RED ROACH
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT WOULD BE A VERY EASY MATTER TO CONCENTRATE THIS AND I FOUND I COULD SELL THE STUFF AT A GOOD PRICE
IT IS SET IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF WOODS AND SWEEPS OF LAWN FLANKED BY UNUSUALLY LARGE CONSERVATORIES AND ALWAYS BRIGHT IN SUMMER WITH GLOWING FLOWER BEDS
NONE OF THE EXUBERANT VERSIONS OF THINGS EDISON HAS NOT DONE COULD ENDURE FOR A MOMENT WITH THE SIMPLE NARRATIVE OF WHAT HE HAS REALLY DONE AS THE WORLD'S NEW PURVEYOR OF PLEASURE
I GUESS EDISON WAS TIRED ALSO BUT HE TOOK IT VERY PHILOSOPHICALLY THIS WAS APPARENTLY THE FIRST PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION OF THE X-RAY TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
AND HE WOULD NOT LET GO EVEN IF BUSY TO THE BREAKING-POINT
EDISON REALIZED FROM THE START THAT THE TRUE SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM LAY IN THE CONTINUOUS TREATMENT OF THE MATERIAL WITH THE MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT OF NATURAL FORCES AND THE MINIMUM OF MANUAL LABOR AND GENERATED POWER
A NUMBER OF THESE BOOKS WERE AND ARE NOW ALWAYS TO BE FOUND SCATTERED AROUND IN THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE LABORATORY AND IN THEM HAVE BEEN NOTED BY EDISON ALL HIS IDEAS SKETCHES AND MEMORANDA
AND A HOST OF MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES REVEALED ON LOOKING AROUND THE SHELVES AS WELL AS AN INTERMINABLE COLLECTION OF CHEMICALS INCLUDING ACIDS ALKALIES SALTS REAGENTS EVERY CONCEIVABLE ESSENTIAL OIL AND ALL THE THINKABLE EXTRACTS
THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REALLY SERIOUS PRACTICAL PROBLEM AND THE WRITERS CAN TESTIFY THAT AT THE MOMENT WHEN HIS DECISION WAS REACHED WORK STOPPED AND THE LONG VISTA AHEAD WAS PEERED INTO EDISON WAS AS LITTLE CONCERNED AS IF HE HAD CONCLUDED THAT AFTER ALL PERHAPS PEACH-PIE MIGHT BE BETTER FOR PRESENT DIET THAN APPLE-PIE
THIS FIGURE WOULD ALSO REST ON THE BASIS OF USING IN THE MIXTURE THE GRAVEL EXCAVATED ON THE SITE
EVERY INVENTOR KNOWS HOW LARGELY HIS FATE LIES IN THE HANDS OF A COMPETENT AND ALERT PATENT ATTORNEY IN BOTH THE PREPARATION AND THE PROSECUTION OF HIS CASE
MENLO PARK MUST ALWAYS BE LOOKED UPON AS THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER INDUSTRY

THE VARIOUS ACTORS ARE SELECTED PARTS ARE ASSIGNED AND THE SCENE-PAINTERS ARE SET TO WORK ON THE PRODUCTION OF THE DESIRED SCENERY
IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN SUCH A COURSE CAN BE FOLLOWED WITH RELATIVE IMPUNITY
HIS FATHER WAS WITH HIM
THE EDISON INVENTION INVOLVES THE USE OF AN ENTIRELY NEW VOLTAIC COMBINATION IN AN ALKALINE ELECTROLYTE IN PLACE OF THE LEAD-LEAD-PEROXIDE COMBINATION AND ACID ELECTROLYTE CHARACTERISTIC OF ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL STORAGE BATTERIES
THE IDEA OF ATTRIBUTING GREAT SUCCESSES TO GENIUS HAS ALWAYS BEEN REPUDIATED BY EDISON AS EVIDENCED BY HIS HISTORIC REMARK THAT GENIUS IS 1 PER CENT
THE STOCK PRINTER IN THESE MODERN DAYS WHEN THE STOCK TICKER IS IN UNIVERSAL USE ONE SELDOM IF EVER HEARS THE NAME OF EDISON COUPLED WITH THE LITTLE INSTRUMENT WHOSE CHATTERINGS HAVE SUCH TREMENDOUS IMPORT TO THE WHOLE WORLD
THE GEARING ORIGINALLY EMPLOYED CONSISTED OF A FRICTION-PULLEY UPON THE ARMATURE SHAFT ANOTHER FRICTION-PULLEY UPON THE DRIVEN AXLE AND A THIRD FRICTION-PULLEY WHICH COULD BE BROUGHT IN CONTACT WITH THE OTHER TWO BY A SUITABLE LEVER
THE ENGINES THAT WERE MADE PART OF THE FIRST THREE JUMBOS PLACED IN THE STATION WERE THE VERY BEST THAT COULD BE OBTAINED AT THE TIME AND EVEN THEN HAD BEEN SPECIALLY DESIGNED AND BUILT FOR THE PURPOSE

SOME IDEA OF THE RAPIDITY OF AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHY MAY BE OBTAINED WHEN WE CONSIDER THE FACT THAT WITH THE USE OF EDISON'S SYSTEM IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES IT WAS COMMON PRACTICE TO TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE FROM THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND WORDS A MINUTE OVER A SINGLE LINE BETWEEN NEW YORK AND PHILADELPHIA
HAD EVERYTHING BEEN NORMAL A FEW HOURS WOULD HAVE SUFFICED FOR COMPLETION OF THE WORK BUT ON COMING TO TEST THE BIG COIL IT WAS FOUND TO BE ABSOLUTELY OUT OF COMMISSION HAVING BEEN SO SERIOUSLY INJURED AS TO NECESSITATE ITS ENTIRE REWINDING
ALL OF THE LARGER PRODUCERS OF PICTURES IN THIS COUNTRY AND ABROAD EMPLOY REGULAR STOCK COMPANIES OF ACTORS MEN AND WOMEN SELECTED ESPECIALLY FOR THEIR SKILL IN PANTOMIME ALTHOUGH AS MOST OBSERVERS HAVE PERHAPS SUSPECTED IN THE ACTUAL TAKING OF THE PICTURES THE PERFORMERS ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY ON AN ANIMATED AND PREPARED DIALOGUE WITH THE SAME SPIRIT AND ANIMATION AS ON THE REGULAR STAGE
THE SAME SPEECHES WERE USED AGAIN PHONOGRAPHICALLY AT THE ELECTRICAL SHOW IN CHICAGO IN 1909--AND NOW THE RECORDS ARE PRESERVED FOR REPRODUCTION A HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE
ONE OF THEM HAD GONE OVER TO JEFFERSONVILLE AND HAD FALLEN OFF A HORSE AND BROKEN HIS LEG AND WAS IN A HOSPITAL
IT SHOULD BE FIRST UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ABOVE SKETCH IS IN BROAD OUTLINE WITHOUT ELABORATION MERELY TO ILLUSTRATE THE WORKING PRINCIPLE
THESE PROBLEMS WERE ALL ATTACKED IN A RESOLUTE THOROUGHGOING MANNER AND ONE BY ONE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION OF NEW AND UNPRECEDENTED DEVICES THAT WERE ADEQUATE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE TIME AND WHICH ARE EMBODIED IN APPARATUS OF SLIGHT MODIFICATION IN USE UP TO THE PRESENT DAY
THE SECOND ITEM WAS THE INGENIOUS AND VARIED FORMS OF CONVEYOR BELT DEVISED AND USED BY EDISON AT THE CONCENTRATING WORKS AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEVELOPED INTO A SEPARATE AND EXTENSIVE BUSINESS BY AN ENGINEER TO WHOM HE GAVE PERMISSION TO USE HIS PLANS AND PATTERNS
WHILE THIS OF ITSELF IS ALSO A BUSINESS OF CONSIDERABLE MAGNITUDE IN ITS AGGREGATE YEARLY TRANSACTIONS IT CALLS FOR NO SPECIAL COMMENT IN REGARD TO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION EXCEPT TO NOTE THAT A CORPS OF EXPERIMENTERS IS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED REFINING AND PERFECTING DETAILS OF THE MACHINE
EDGAR OF THE BOSTON EDISON SYSTEM STATED THAT HE HAD 800 OF THE METERS IN SERVICE CARED FOR BY TWO MEN AND THREE BOYS THE LATTER EMPLOYED IN COLLECTING THE METER CELLS

RESTING UPON THE PERIPHERY OF THESE TWO SEGMENTAL WHEELS THERE ARE TWO BRUSHES TO WHICH ARE CONNECTED THE WIRES WHICH CARRY THE BATTERY CURRENT TO THE TYPE-MAGNET AND PRESS-MAGNET RESPECTIVELY AS THE BRUSHES MAKE CIRCUIT BY COMING IN CONTACT WITH THE METALLIC SEGMENTS
NOT ONLY MUST HE BE PREPARED TO FIGHT IN THE PATENT OFFICE AND PURSUE A REGULAR COURSE OF PATENT LITIGATION AGAINST THOSE WHO MAY HONESTLY DEEM THEMSELVES TO BE PROTECTED BY OTHER INVENTIONS OR PATENTS OF SIMILAR CHARACTER AND ALSO PROCEED AGAINST MORE PALPABLE INFRINGERS WHO ARE OPENLY DEFIANTLY AND ILLEGITIMATELY ENGAGED IN COMPETITIVE BUSINESS OPERATIONS BUT HE MUST AS WELL ENDEAVOR TO PROTECT HIMSELF AGAINST THE ASSAULTS OF IMPUDENT FRAUD BY EDUCATING THE PUBLIC MIND TO A POINT OF INTELLIGENT APPREHENSION OF THE TRUE STATUS OF HIS INVENTION AND THE CONFLICTING CLAIMS INVOLVED
HIS PROPOSITION WAS AGAINST ALL PRECEDENT
BOTH UTILIZATIONS DEPENDED UPON THE SUPPLY OF CURRENT NOW CHEAPLY OBTAINABLE FROM THE DYNAMO
AND IN DECEMBER IT WAS A PORTLY MAGAZINE OF FORTY-EIGHT
BUT IT IS EQUALLY TRUE THAT AS ALREADY NOTED SOME OF THESE INDUSTRIES ARE DIRECTLY THE CREATION OF EDISON WHILE IN EVERY ONE OF THE REST HIS IMPRESS HAS BEEN DEEP AND SIGNIFICANT

WITH EDISON'S TELEPHONE THERE IS USED A CLOSED CIRCUIT ON WHICH A BATTERY CURRENT CONSTANTLY FLOWS AND IN THAT CIRCUIT IS A PAIR OF ELECTRODES ONE OR BOTH OF WHICH IS CARBON
A LITTLE MORE IS THE COMMAND AGAIN AND THEN ONE OF THE LAMPS EMITS FOR AN INSTANT A LIGHT LIKE A STAR IN THE DISTANCE AFTER WHICH THERE IS AN ERUPTION AND A PUFF
IT WAS NOT A FACT AT ANY TIME THAT THE PUBLIC WAS OPPOSED TO THE IDEA OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
ANOTHER OF THE BOYS HAD A VOICE THAT SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING BETWEEN THE RING OF AN OLD TOMATO CAN AND A PEWTER JUG
THE HOME AT PORT HURON THUS SAW THE FIRST EDISON LABORATORY
WE USED TO NUMBER OUR EXPERIMENTS CONSECUTIVELY FROM 1 TO 10,000 AND WHEN WE GOT UP TO 10,000 WE TURNED BACK TO 1 AND RAN UP TO 10,000 AGAIN AND SO ON
AT ANY RATE THE PEOPLE INVITED TO DINNER WERE VERY MUCH INTERESTED AND THEY QUESTIONED ME AS TO WHAT I THOUGHT OF THE PROPOSITION
IF EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS INVESTIGATIONS AND WORK ON THIS STORAGE BATTERY WERE ALL THAT HE HAD EVER DONE I SHOULD SAY THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A NOTABLE INVENTOR BUT ALSO A GREAT MAN
NOR COULD THE CABLE BE REPAIRED
CORES WERE MADE OF CAST IRON OTHERS OF FORGED IRON
PUT EACH IN A BOTTLE AFTER IT HAS BEEN DRIED AND LABEL THE BOTTLE WITH THE PROCESS ETC SO WE MAY BE ABLE TO DUPLICATE IT

AN ACCURATE ILLUSTRATION OF THIS MACHINE AS IT STOOD IN THE ENGINE-ROOM AT MENLO PARK IS GIVEN IN VAN NOSTRAND'S ENGINEERING MAGAZINE VOL
ITS INVENTION HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE DISCOVERY THAT A POINT ATTACHED TO A TELEPHONE DIAPHRAGM WOULD UNDER THE EFFECT OF SOUND-WAVES VIBRATE WITH SUFFICIENT FORCE TO PRICK THE FINGER
THE CONDITION OF THE TEST WAS THAT HE WAS TO SEND FROM LIVERPOOL AND RECEIVE IN LONDON AND TO RECORD AT THE RATE OF ONE THOUSAND WORDS PER MINUTE FIVE HUNDRED WORDS TO BE SENT EVERY HALF HOUR FOR SIX HOURS
THE NECESSITY FOR THIS INVENTION AROSE OUT OF THE PROBLEM OF INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF TELEGRAPH LINES EMPLOYED IN THROUGH AND WAY SERVICE SUCH AS UPON RAILROADS
ALL PERSONS WHO MAKE INVENTIONS WILL NECESSARILY BE MORE OR LESS ORIGINAL IN CHARACTER BUT TO THE MAN WHO CHOOSES TO BECOME AN INVENTOR BY PROFESSION MUST BE CONCEDED A MIND MORE THAN ORDINARILY REPLETE WITH VIRILITY AND ORIGINALITY
THIS PAD WAS CARRIED ON THE END OF A VIBRATING ARM WHOSE LATERAL MOVEMENT WAS LIMITED BETWEEN TWO ADJUSTABLE POINTS

BUT SOCIETY HAS NEVER CEASED TO SEEK HIM AND TO-DAY AS EVER THE PRESSURE UPON HIM TO GIVE UP HIS WORK AND RECEIVE HONORS MEET DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE OR ATTEND PUBLIC FUNCTIONS IS INTENSE
THE DISTILLATION SHOULD BE CARRIED TO SAY 600 DEGREES OR 700 DEGREES FAHR BUT NOT CONTINUED LONG ENOUGH TO WHOLLY REDUCE MASS TO CHARCOAL BUT ALWAYS RUN TO BLACKNESS
THEY HAD BEEN LAID ASIDE FOR THE PHONOGRAPH
BUT IT WAS THERE EQUALLY THAT THE EDISON DYNAMO AND SYSTEM OF DISTRIBUTION WERE CREATED AND APPLIED TO THEIR SPECIFIC PURPOSES
I DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WOULD DECOMPOSE BY WATER

AS EDISON HAD DETERMINED UPON TREATING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TONS OR MORE PER HOUR HE DECIDED TO DEVISE AN ENTIRELY NEW TYPE OF GREAT CAPACITY REQUIRING A MINIMUM OF POWER FOR ELEVATING THE MATERIAL AND DEPENDING UPON THE FORCE OF GRAVITY FOR HANDLING IT DURING THE DRYING PROCESS

WITH THIS DISTINCTION BEFORE HIM THE READER WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN FOLLOWING THE CIRCUITS OF FIG
UNTIL THE TIME OF EDISON'S INVESTIGATIONS OF 1875 NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION ELECTRICITY HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO MANIFEST ITSELF EXCEPT THROUGH A CLOSED CIRCUIT
IT HAS BEEN SEEN BY MY FRIEND PROF J
STRANGE TO SAY THAT ALTHOUGH EDISON'S EARLY EXPERIMENTS IN ETHERIC FORCE CALLED FORTH EXTENSIVE COMMENT AND DISCUSSION IN THE PUBLIC PRINTS OF THE PERIOD THEY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN GENERALLY OVERLOOKED WHEN THE WORK OF HERTZ WAS PUBLISHED
OTHERS NEED SPECIAL KEYS
DYER
THE STORES AND PLACES OF PUBLIC RESORT ARE GATHERED ABOUT THE SQUARE WHERE THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR HITCHING WHEN THE SATURDAY TRADING IS DONE AT THAT POINT AT WHICH PERIODS THE FITFUL BUSTLE RECALLS THE OLD WHEAT DAYS WHEN YOUNG EDISON RAN WITH CURIOSITY AMONG THE SIX AND EIGHT HORSE TEAMS THAT HAD BROUGHT IN GRAIN
AND EVER A PROOF OF THE FACT THAT ONCE A MAN HAS BECOME ESTABLISHED AS A PERSONALITY IN THE PUBLIC EYE AND MIND NOTHING CAN STOP THE TIDE OF CORRESPONDENCE THAT WILL DELUGE HIM
THEY KEPT ME AT IT UNTIL THE CROWD GOT SO GREAT MR BEACH WAS AFRAID THE FLOOR WOULD COLLAPSE
THE COMMUTATOR HAD 73 SECTIONS
THE GOULD AND FISK CROWD HAD CORNERED GOLD AND HAD RUN THE QUOTATIONS UP FASTER THAN THE INDICATOR COULD FOLLOW
IT SEEMS THAT SOME TIME AGO ONE OF THE HELPERS IN THE CHEMICAL DEPARTMENT AN EXCITABLE FOREIGNER BECAME DISSATISFIED WITH HIS WAGES AND AFTER MAKING AN UNSUCCESSFUL APPLICATION FOR AN INCREASE RUSHED IN DESPERATION TO EDISON AND SAID EEF I NOT GET MORE MONEY I GO TO TAKE ZE CYANIDE POTASSIA EDISON GAVE HIM ONE QUICK SEARCHING GLANCE AND DETECTING A BLUFF REPLIED IN AN OFFHAND MANNER
THESE IMPULSES ACCORDING TO BELL'S THEORY CORRESPOND IN FORM TO THE SOUND-WAVES AND PASSING OVER THE LINE ENERGIZE THE MAGNET COIL AT THE RECEIVING END THUS GIVING RISE TO CORRESPONDING VARIATIONS IN MAGNETISM BY REASON OF WHICH THE RECEIVING DIAPHRAGM IS SIMILARLY VIBRATED SO AS TO REPRODUCE THE SOUNDS
THEY HAD A VERY FINE INSTALLATION OF MACHINERY
WITH THE DUPLEX AS WE HAVE SEEN THE CURRENT ON THE MAIN LINE IS CHANGED IN STRENGTH ONLY WHEN BOTH KEYS AT OPPOSITE STATIONS ARE CLOSED TOGETHER SO THAT A CURRENT DUE TO BOTH BATTERIES FLOWS OVER THE MAIN LINE
BUT IT IS CERTAINLY DUE TO THE SUBJECT TO PRESENT THE FACTS IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO SHOW THAT THIS GREAT INVENTION WAS NEITHER THE RESULT OF IMPROVING SOME PROCESS OR DEVICE THAT WAS KNOWN OR EXISTING AT THE TIME NOR DUE TO ANY UNFORESEEN LUCKY CHANCE NOR THE ACCIDENTAL RESULT OF OTHER EXPERIMENTS
IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A PARTICULARLY ACUTE PROPHETIC VISION TO SEE FLOWER TOWNS OF POURED HOUSES GOING UP IN WHOLE SUBURBS OUTSIDE ALL OUR CHIEF CENTRES OF POPULATION
THE BOYS IN THOSE DAYS HAD EXTRAORDINARY FACILITIES FOR TRAVEL
TILL 4 A.M WHEN GOT TO SLEEP WITH A BIG DOSE OF MORPHINE
BUT WE FOUND THAT OUR BOOKS WERE KEPT BADLY AND THAT THE PERSON IN CHARGE WHO WAS NO BUSINESS MAN HAD NEGLECTED THAT PART OF IT
YOU MAY HAVE AT A DISTANCE ANOTHER DISK WHICH WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY EXECUTE THE SAME VIBRATIONS
THE MECHANICAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE BATTERY AS A WHOLE IN ITS PRESENT FORM COMPELS INSTANT ADMIRATION ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BEAUTY AND COMPLETENESS

IN NOVEMBER 1875 EDISON WHILE EXPERIMENTING IN HIS NEWARK LABORATORY DISCOVERED A NEW MANIFESTATION OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH MYSTERIOUS SPARKS WHICH COULD BE PRODUCED UNDER CONDITIONS UNKNOWN UP TO THAT TIME
HIS FACE WAS AT THAT TIME AS IT IS NOW CLEAN SHAVEN
WHEN MY WIFE AND I ARRIVED AT THE TOP WE FOUND THAT GOUNOD THE COMPOSER WAS THERE
IT IS AN ABSOLUTE FACT THAT THE GREAT ELECTRICAL INVENTORS AND THE MEN WHO STOOD BEHIND THEM HAVE HAD LITTLE RETURN FOR THEIR FORESIGHT AND COURAGE
THE FLOW OF CURRENT WILL CAUSE TWO EQUAL OPPOSING ACTIONS TO BE SET UP IN THE BAR
XIX
THE ANALYSIS OF SOUND WHICH OWES SO MUCH TO HELMHOLTZ WAS ONE STEP TOWARD RECORDING
UNDER THAT PLAN RESEMBLING THE METHODS OF 1878 THE MACHINES AND BLANK CYLINDERS WERE MANUFACTURED BY THE EDISON PHONOGRAPH WORKS WHICH STILL RETAINS ITS FACTORIES AT ORANGE NEW JERSEY
ALL NIGHT LONG THE STREETS WERE FULL OF PEOPLE
A LITTLE LATER EDISON AND GILLILAND JOINED FORCES WITH LUCIUS J
WE HAVEN'T GOT A CENT I FELT VERY HAPPY BECAUSE WE WERE POOR
I TOLD HIM TO LET THE CABLE STAND STILL AND SEND ELECTRICITY THROUGH IT AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO MOVE HUNDREDS OF TONS OF METAL ALL THE TIME
EVERYTHING WORKED SATISFACTORILY IN THE MAIN
A GRIMLY HUMOROUS INCIDENT AS RELATED BY ONE OF THE LABORATORY STAFF ATTACHES TO NO
THE FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY WAS PECULIAR AND WORTHY OF ATTENTION
THAT MANY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PERFORMANCE OF THE CHEMICAL CELL WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO IT AND THAT IF THE MAXIMUM WORK COULD BE GOTTEN OUT OF A SET OF BATTERIES WHEN THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL RESISTANCES WERE EQUAL AND THIS WAS COMMERCIALLY THE BEST THING TO DO SO MUST IT BE ALSO WITH A DYNAMO
SAMUEL EDISON LEFT BEHIND HIM HOWEVER IN CANADA SEVERAL BROTHERS ALL OF WHOM LIVED TO THE AGE OF NINETY OR MORE AND FROM WHOM THERE ARE DESCENDANTS IN THE REGION
WE FOUND AN IMMENSE CROWD OF MEN AND BOYS THERE AND IN THE ADJOINING STREETS--A PERFECT JAM

HERE JUMBOS WERE INSTALLED FROM TIME TO TIME UNTIL AT LAST THERE WERE NO FEWER THAN TEN OF THEM
A CONTINUOUSLY OPERATIVE PRIMARY BATTERY
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE ELECTRIC-LIGHT FUROR WHICH SOON ROSE TO SENSATIONAL HEIGHTS

DURING THE FORMATIVE PERIOD OF THE MARCONI COMPANY ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO INFLUENCE EDISON TO SELL THIS PATENT TO AN OPPOSING CONCERN BUT HIS REGARD FOR MARCONI AND BELIEF IN THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF HIS WORK WERE SO STRONG THAT HE REFUSED FLATLY BECAUSE IN THE HANDS OF AN ENEMY THE PATENT MIGHT BE USED INIMICALLY TO MARCONI'S INTERESTS
IN OTHER WORDS EDISON'S REAL WORK HAS SELDOM BEEN SERIOUSLY DISCUSSED
AS FOR PAPER THERE IS EVERYTHING IN WHITE AND COLORED FROM THINNEST TISSUE UP TO THE HEAVIEST ASBESTOS EVEN A FEW NEWSPAPERS BEING ALWAYS ON HAND
IT WILL BE GRANTED THAT THIS WAS A REMARKABLE ENGINEERING FEAT ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT EDISON WAS THEN A NEW-COMER IN THE CEMENT BUSINESS AND ALSO THAT IF THE PLANT WERE TO BE REBUILT TO-DAY NO VITAL CHANGE WOULD BE DESIRABLE OR NECESSARY
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE LAYERS OF FLAKE NICKEL EXTEND PRACTICALLY UNBROKEN ACROSS THE TUBE AND MAKE CONTACT WITH THE METAL WALL AT BOTH SIDES
WHEN IN A TELEGRAPH OFFICE I COULD ONLY HEAR THE INSTRUMENT DIRECTLY ON THE TABLE AT WHICH I SAT AND UNLIKE THE OTHER OPERATORS I WAS NOT BOTHERED BY THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS
HE WAS AGAIN PUT ON NIGHT DUTY MUCH TO HIS SATISFACTION
A CLUE TO HIS ACTIVITY IS FURNISHED IN THE FACT THAT IN 1872 HE HAD APPLIED FOR THIRTY-EIGHT PATENTS IN THE CLASS OF TELEGRAPHY AND TWENTY-FIVE IN 1873
EDISON'S INGENUITY ENGINEERING ABILITY AND INVENTIVE SKILL WERE EQUAL TO THE TASK HOWEVER AND WERE DISPLAYED IN A SYSTEM AND VARIETY OF CONVEYORS THAT IN PRACTICE SEEMED TO ACT WITH ALMOST HUMAN DISCRIMINATION
HENCE BY REASON OF THIS EXTENSIVE WORK AND KNOWLEDGE EDISON WAS NATURALLY IN A POSITION TO REALIZE THE UTTER COMMERCIAL IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE THEN BEST DYNAMO MACHINE IN EXISTENCE WHICH HAD AN EFFICIENCY OF ONLY ABOUT 40 PER CENT AND WAS CONSTRUCTED ON THE CUT-AND-TRY PRINCIPLE
HE WAS CONVINCED FROM THE FIRST THAT THE TRUE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM LAY IN A LAMP WHICH SHOULD HAVE AS ITS ILLUMINATING BODY A STRIP OF MATERIAL WHICH WOULD OFFER SUCH A RESISTANCE TO THE FLOW OF ELECTRIC CURRENT THAT IT COULD BE RAISED TO A HIGH TEMPERATURE--INCANDESCENCE--AND BE OF SUCH SMALL CROSS-SECTION THAT IT WOULD RADIATE BUT LITTLE HEAT
HE IS A VERY WELL-INSTRUCTED MAN IN HIS PROFESSION
THE NUMBER OF OPERATORS WAS SMALL AND THEY WERE IN DEMAND EVERYWHERE IT WAS IN THIS WAY EDISON MADE HIS WAY SOUTH AS FAR AS MEMPHIS TENNESSEE WHERE THE TELEGRAPH SERVICE AT THAT TIME WAS UNDER MILITARY LAW ALTHOUGH THE OPERATORS RECEIVED $125 A MONTH
IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY EDISON WOULD HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY RECEIVED SIGNAL HONORS
THE BIG LIBRARY--SEMI-BOUDOIR--UP-STAIRS IS ALSO VERY EXPRESSIVE OF THE HOME LIFE OF EDISON BUT AGAIN TYPICAL OF HIS NATURE AND DISPOSITION FOR IT IS DIFFICULT TO OVERLAY HIS MANY TECHNICAL BOOKS AND SCIENTIFIC PERIODICALS WITH A SUFFICIENTLY THICK CRUST OF POPULAR MAGAZINES OR CURRENT LITERATURE TO PREVENT THEIR OUTCROPPING INTO EVIDENCE
IT WAS IN BOSTON I BOUGHT FARADAY'S WORKS
A WAX CYLINDER HAVING WALLS LESS THAN ONE-QUARTER OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS COULD BE USED FOR RECEIVING A LARGE NUMBER OF RECORDS SINCE THE MAXIMUM DEPTH OF THE RECORD GROOVE IS HARDLY EVER GREATER THAN ONE ONE-THOUSANDTH OF AN INCH
MUYBRIDGE SECURED ONLY ONE CYCLE OF MOVEMENT BECAUSE A SEPARATE CAMERA HAD TO BE USED FOR EACH PHOTOGRAPH AND CONSEQUENTLY EACH CYCLE WAS REPRODUCED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THAT LET ALL THE FUMES AND CHEMICALS OUT AND OVERCAME THE FIREMEN
FROM CEYLON I PROCEEDED TO INDIA TOUCHING THE GREAT PENINSULA FIRST AT CAPE COMORIN AND CONTINUING NORTHWARD BY WAY OF PONDICHERRY MADURA AND MADRAS
THIS IDEA THE GERM OF WHICH CAME FROM THE LITTLE TOY CALLED THE ZOETROPE AND THE WORK OF MUYBRIDGE MAREY AND OTHERS HAS NOW BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SO THAT EVERY CHANGE OF FACIAL EXPRESSION CAN BE RECORDED AND REPRODUCED LIFE-SIZE
BURBANK AND HIS TRIBE REPRESENT IN THE VEGETABLE WORLD EDISON IN THE MECHANICAL
YOU HAVE DISTANCED ALL COMPETITORS AND OBTAINED A DIPLOMA OF HONOR THE HIGHEST AWARD GIVEN IN THE EXPOSITION
BUT SOONER OR LATER THE NOTE-BOOKS OR THE PATENT OFFICE WILL BEAR TESTIMONY TO THE REMINISCENT OUTCROPPING OF LATENT THOUGHT ON THE MATTER
EACH TRIAL BEARING SOME TERSE COMMENT EXPRESSIVE OF RESULTS
ALSO SWITCHES FOR TURNING THE CURRENT ON AND OFF
NO ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO CONFORM WITH STRICTLY SCIENTIFIC TERMINOLOGY BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GENERAL READER WELL-UNDERSTOOD CONVENTIONAL EXPRESSIONS SUCH AS FLOW OF CURRENT ETC HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED
OBVIOUSLY THIS HEAT WAS ENTIRELY LOST
FINALLY EPSTEIN WAS SO PERSISTENT THAT BERGMANN CALLED AN ASSISTANT AND TOLD HIM TO GO AND SEE IF HE HAD ANY CHIPS
AND THEIR LANGUAGE WAS FRIGHTFUL EVEN TO AN IRISHMAN
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STORAGE BATTERY HAS BEEN NO EXCEPTION

ALTHOUGH POSSESSING IN NO SMALL DEGREE THE MECHANICAL AND MANIPULATIVE SKILL OF THE FAMILY HE HAS CHOSEN CHEMISTRY AS HIS SPECIAL DOMAIN AND MAY BE FOUND WITH THE OTHER CHEMISTS IN ONE OF THE CHEMICAL-ROOMS
THIS YIELDED GOOD PRACTICE NIGHTLY LASTING UNTIL 12 AND 1 O'CLOCK AND WAS MAINTAINED FOR SOME TIME UNTIL MR EDISON BECAME WILLING THAT HIS SON SHOULD STAY UP FOR A REASONABLE TIME
FOR MAKING DUPLICATES IT WAS OBVIOUSLY NECESSARY TO FIRST SECURE A MOLD CARRYING THE RECORD IN NEGATIVE OR REVERSED FORM
AT FIRST THE INSTRUMENTS WERE LEASED
IF THEY WERE PLACED IN SERIES THE LIGHT VARIED INVERSELY AS THE SQUARE OF THE NUMBER OF LAMPS IN CIRCUIT
WHAT PUZZLED THE OLD POLITICIAN WAS THAT EDISON WOULD ACCEPT NOTHING FOR HIS ADVICE
HE WAS STILL BUSILY ENGAGED ON THE TELEPHONE ON ACOUSTIC ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION SEXTUPLEX TELEGRAPHS DUPLEX TELEGRAPHS MISCELLANEOUS CARBON ARTICLES AND OTHER INVENTIONS OF A MINOR NATURE
ALL THE WORK PRIOR TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DYNAMO AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT WAS SPORADIC AND SPASMODIC AND CANNOT BE SAID TO HAVE LEFT ANY TRACE ON THE ART THOUGH IT OFFERED MANY SUGGESTIONS AS TO OPERATIVE METHODS
THE CEREMONY OF IDENTIFICATION PERFORMED WITH THE PAYING TELLER WHO WAS QUITE MERRY OVER THE INCIDENT EDISON WAS GIVEN THE AMOUNT IN BUNDLES OF SMALL BILLS UNTIL THERE CERTAINLY SEEMED TO BE ONE CUBIC FOOT UNAWARE THAT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF A PRACTICAL JOKE EDISON PROCEEDED GRAVELY TO STOW AWAY THE MONEY IN HIS OVERCOAT POCKETS AND ALL HIS OTHER POCKETS
THE SAME LITTLE SPACE A FEW FEET SQUARE WAS SOON CONVERTED BY THIS PRECOCIOUS YOUTH INTO A NEWSPAPER OFFICE
OVER THIS WAS PLACED A CIRCULAR DISK OF PAPER
I REMEMBER THE VISIT OF ONE EXPERT A WELL-KNOWN ELECTRICIAN A GRADUATE OF JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY AND WHO THEN REPRESENTED A BALTIMORE GAS COMPANY
THE REMARK IS AN EVIDENCE OF THE KIND OF PREPARATION EDISON GAVE HIMSELF FOR HIS NEW TASK
HENCE HE COULD NOT BE RUSHED OR BROKEN IN RECEIVING WHILE HE COULD TURN OUT COPY THAT WAS A MARVEL OF NEATNESS AND CLEARNESS
A SMALLER BUT PERHAPS MORE COMFORTABLE HOME WAS THEN BUILT BY EDISON'S FATHER ON SOME PROPERTY HE HAD BOUGHT AT THE NEAR-BY VILLAGE OF GRATIOT AND THERE HIS MOTHER SPENT THE REMAINDER OF HER LIFE IN CONFIRMED INVALIDISM DYING IN 1871
WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR ALL THE PASSENGERS ROARED WITH LAUGHTER
THE OPERATOR AT THE KEYBOARD WOULD DEPRESS THE LETTER A WHEREUPON THE CYLINDER WOULD IN ITS REVOLUTION BRING THE FIRST-NAMED PIN AGAINST THE KEY
NOT OF COURSE THE PHONOGRAPH OF THE PRESENT DAY WITH ALL OF ITS MECHANICAL PERFECTION BUT AS AN INSTRUMENT CAPABLE OF RECORDING AND REPRODUCING SOUND
I DID ALL THE TALKING
IF HE HAD NOT BEEN SO INTENT ON INVENTING HE WOULD HAVE MADE MORE OF HIS GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GETTING RICH
AND THE POLICEMAN REMARKED APOLOGETICALLY THAT IT WAS FORTUNATE FOR EDISON HE WAS NOT A BETTER SHOT
AMONG OTHERS WHO WERE ADDED TO MR KRUESI'S STAFF IN THE MACHINE-SHOP WERE MESSRS
THE PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION OF THIS APPARATUS HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO A VERY BRIEF AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION BUT IT IS BELIEVED TO BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE SCOPE OF THIS ARTICLE
THE PAPERS NEXT MORNING CONTAINED COLUMNS
HIS VERY FIRST QUESTION WAS
FOR MANY YEARS A SUIT WAS USED AS A MEASUREMENT
STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THEREFORE AND CONTRARY TO THE GENERAL BELIEF THE PHONOGRAPH WAS DEVELOPED BACKWARD THE PRODUCTION OF THE SOUNDS BEING OF PRIOR DEVELOPMENT TO THE IDEA OF ACTUALLY RECORDING THEM
EDISON SAYS OF THESE SCHOLARS THAT THEY PARADED THEIR KNOWLEDGE RATHER FREELY AND THAT IT WAS HIS DELIGHT TO GO TO THE SECOND-HAND BOOK STORES ON CORNHILL AND STUDY UP QUESTIONS WHICH HE COULD SPRING UPON THEM WHEN HE GOT AN OCCASION
SO IT WAS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT THE EXPERIMENTS AND THEIR RESULTS SHOULD BE KEPT A SECRET UNTIL EDISON HAD SECURED THE PROTECTION OF THE PATENT OFFICE WITH THIS STAFF WAS ASSOCIATED FROM THE FIRST MR E
INDEED IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE INVENTION OF AN ENORMOUS VARIETY OF NEW MACHINES AND MECHANICAL APPLIANCES RENDERED NECESSARY BY EACH CHANGE DURING THE VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE BATTERY FROM FIRST TO LAST STANDS AS A LASTING TRIBUTE TO THE RANGE AND VERSATILITY OF HIS POWERS
IT HAD ONE MAIN ENTRANCE FROM THE STREET TO A HALLWAY FROM WHICH ENTRANCE TO THE OFFICES OF TWO PROMINENT BROKER FIRMS WAS OBTAINED
THEY WERE PUT UP CHEAPLY AS I USED THE ROOFS OF HOUSES JUST AS THE WESTERN UNION DID
AND THEREFORE IN EFFECT IS A CONSTANT ELEMENT NOT CHANGING IN DENSITY OR IN CONDUCTIVITY
TO INCREASE THE VOLTAGE OR PRESSURE MATERIALLY WHILE PERMITTING SOME SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS WOULD ENORMOUSLY INCREASE THE DIFFICULTIES OF MAKING A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH RESISTANCE CONDUCTOR TO SECURE LIGHT BY INCANDESCENCE

OMITTING THE LABORATORY STRUCTURES IT HAD ONLY ABOUT SEVEN HOUSES THE BEST LOOKING OF WHICH EDISON LIVED IN A PLACE THAT HAD A WINDMILL PUMPING WATER INTO A RESERVOIR
BUT IT DID NOT END AT THAT TIME IN ANY PRACTICAL RESULTS AS THE NORTHERN PACIFIC WENT INTO THE HANDS OF A RECEIVER AND MR VILLARD'S ABILITY TO HELP WAS HOPELESSLY CRIPPLED
BY 1878 THE ARC-LIGHTING INDUSTRY HAD SPRUNG INTO EXISTENCE IN SO PROMISING A MANNER AS TO ENGENDER AN EXTRAORDINARY FEVER AND FUROR OF SPECULATION
BEING FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS A WAY OUT HE PUSHED ASIDE A MASS OF OTHER WORK AND SETTLED DOWN TO THIS PROBLEM WITH THE RESULT THAT ON NOVEMBER 20 1882 ONLY TWO MONTHS AFTER CURRENT HAD BEEN SENT OUT FROM PEARL STREET HE EXECUTED AN APPLICATION FOR A PATENT COVERING WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE THREE-WIRE SYSTEM IT HAS BEEN UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE INVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF THE LIGHTING ART
OTHER DREAMERS CONTEMPORARIES OF DUCOS MADE SIMILAR SUGGESTIONS

I WENT DOWN ONCE WITH MY FATHER AND TWO ASSISTANTS FOR A LITTLE FISHING INSIDE SANDY HOOK
AFTER THE BREAKING OUT OF THE WAR THERE WAS A REGIMENT OF VOLUNTEER SOLDIERS QUARTERED AT FORT GRATIOT THE RESERVATION EXTENDING TO THE BOUNDARY LINE OF OUR HOUSE
AS A PREMISE TO AN EXPLANATION OF THE PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE TRANSMISSION OF TELEGRAPH MESSAGES BY HAND AT A RATE OF FIFTY WORDS PER MINUTE IS CONSIDERED A GOOD AVERAGE SPEED
RESIN OIL DISTILS OFF EASILY
FOR INSTANCE WHEN EDISON WAS INVESTIGATING A CERTAIN PROBLEM OF IMPORTANCE MANY YEARS AGO THE NOTE-BOOKS SHOW THAT ON THIS POINT ALONE ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND EXPERIMENTS AND TESTS WERE MADE BY ONE OF HIS ASSISTANTS
AND THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE NEW SYSTEM WAS WORKED OUT AND INTRODUCED WAS SIMPLY DUE TO HIS INITIAL MASTERY OF ALL THE FACTORS IN THE OLDER ART
FOR A TIME I THOUGHT I WAS FOOLISH TO IMAGINE SUCH A THING BUT I COULD NEVER GET AWAY FROM THE IMPRESSION THAT HE REALLY APPEARED HAPPY WHEN HE RAN UP AGAINST A SERIOUS SNAG
ON THE LATTER DATE A FULL-PAGE ARTICLE APPEARED IN THE NEW YORK HERALD WHICH SO INTENSIFIED THE EXCITED FEELING THAT MR EDISON DEEMED IT ADVISABLE TO MAKE A PUBLIC EXHIBITION
GARDINER G
AMONG THE LATTER THE PHONOGRAPH MAY BE SPECIALLY MENTIONED AS IT WAS INVENTED IN THE LATE FALL OF 1877
THE LATTER SYSTEM DESCRIBED IN CHAPTER XXIII AND IN A SUCCEEDING ARTICLE OF THIS APPENDIX WAS BASED UPON THE PHENOMENA OF ELECTROMAGNETIC OR ELECTROSTATIC INDUCTION BETWEEN CONDUCTORS SEPARATED BY MORE OR LESS SPACE WHEREBY ELECTRIC IMPULSES OF RELATIVELY LOW POTENTIAL AND LOW FREQUENCY SET UP IN
SUCH IN BRIEF WERE THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH EDISON BASED HIS CONCEPTION AND INVENTION OF THE LONG KILN WHICH HAS SINCE BECOME SO WELL KNOWN IN THE CEMENT BUSINESS
SUCH A MAN IS EDISON
2 THE CONTACT-MAKER
OF THESE TWO BROCKTON REQUIRED THE LARGER PLANT BUT WITH THE CONDUCTORS PLACED UNDERGROUND
EDISON WAS OFFERED $15 BY MR WARD TO GO AND FETCH HIM BUT AS IT WAS A WILD COUNTRY AND WOULD BE DARK EDISON STOOD OUT FOR $25 SO THAT HE COULD GET THE COMPANIONSHIP OF ANOTHER LAD
IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY BUSY YEAR FOR MR EDISON AND HIS WHOLE FORCE WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME WAS INCREASED IN NUMBER
EDISON WHO DID THIS I TOLD HIM THAT BILLY L
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE
MY FAITH IN HUMAN NATURE GOT A SLIGHT JAR EDISON THEN WENT TO TOLEDO AND SECURED A POSITION AT FORT WAYNE ON THE PITTSBURG FORT WAYNE CHICAGO RAILROAD NOW LEASED TO THE PENNSYLVANIA SYSTEM
BUT IN THIS INSTANCE THERE WERE SOME ADVANTAGES ATTACHED TO THE SACRIFICE FOR THE CROWDS OF LION-HUNTERS AND PEOPLE SEEKING BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS WOULD ONLY HAVE GONE OUT TO MENLO PARK

I TAUGHT THE NIGHT-YARDMAN MY CALL SO I COULD GET HALF AN HOUR'S SLEEP NOW AND THEN BETWEEN TRAINS AND IN CASE THE STATION WAS CALLED THE WATCHMAN WOULD AWAKEN ME
NEVERTHELESS AS PUBLIC PATRONAGE IS THE ELEMENT VITALLY REQUISITE FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS AND AS THE PUBLIC IS NOT USUALLY IN FULL POSSESSION OF ALL THE FACTS AND THEREFORE CANNOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE GENUINE AND THE FALSE THE LEGITIMATE INVENTOR MUST AVAIL HIMSELF OF EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS OF PROCLAIMING AND ASSERTING HIS RIGHTS IF HE DESIRES TO DERIVE ANY BENEFIT FROM THE RESULTS OF HIS SKILL AND LABOR
THESE BOYS HAD A HORSE AND SMALL WAGON INTRUSTED TO THEM AND EVERY MORNING IN THE SEASON THEY WOULD LOAD UP WITH ONIONS LETTUCE PEAS ETC AND GO THROUGH THE TOWN
A VERTICAL IDLER-PULLEY WAS MOUNTED IN A FRAME OVER THE BELT FROM MOTOR TO COUNTER-SHAFT TERMINATING IN A VERTICAL SCREW AND HAND-WHEEL FOR TIGHTENING THE BELT TO INCREASE SPEED OR THE REVERSE TO LOWER SPEED
MANY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE CARRIED ON THIS ROAD DURING 1882 THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF EDISON'S ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE OF 1882 IS SHOWN IN THE ILLUSTRATION OPPOSITE PAGE 462 OF THE PRECEDING NARRATIVE
HE SAID PLENTY OF JACK-RABBITS THESE JACK-RABBITS ARE A VERY PECULIAR SPECIES
JUNE 22 1870 114,657 RELAY MAGNETS FOR TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENTS
HIS REPUTATION AS A SCIENTIST INDEED IS SMIRCHED BY THE NEWSPAPER EXAGGERATIONS AND NO DOUBT HE WILL BE MORE CAREFUL IN FUTURE
THE ENGINEERING METHODS PURSUED FORMED THE BASIS OF SIMILAR INSTALLATIONS IN LAWRENCE MASSACHUSETTS IN NOVEMBER 1883
THERE IS PERHAPS MORE THAN ORDINARY COINCIDENCE IN THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON WITH TWO SUCH ACTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF PROGRESS
BUT THE OLD FOUNDATION AND THE FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING STILL REMAIN TO SUPPORT OTHER PARTS
JOHNSON WHOM I HAD KNOWN IN LONDON AND WHO WROTE TO MR U
AND OTHERS ARE NOTED OPPOSITE THE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS AS THEY WERE TRIED
WE COULD ONLY GET THE WIRE AFTER ALL BUSINESS WAS CLEARED USUALLY ABOUT MIDNIGHT AND FOR MONTHS IN THE QUIET HOURS THAT WIRE WAS SUBJECTED TO MORE ELECTRICAL ACROBATICS THAN ANY OTHER WIRE EVER EXPERIENCED
EVERY MORNING I HAD TWO LARGE BASKETS OF VEGETABLES FROM THE DETROIT MARKET LOADED IN THE MAIL-CAR AND SENT TO PORT HURON WHERE THE BOY WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE STORE
THE EXPERIMENT CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY
EDISON AND I WERE VERY FOND OF TRAGEDY
IT IS NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS NARRATIVE TO ENTER INTO ANY DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATIVE MERITS OF THE EDISON STORAGE BATTERY THAT BEING THE PROVINCE OF A COMMERCIAL CATALOGUE

I TOOK IT UP AND IT HAD SOLVED THE ENGINE-OILING PROBLEM--AND MY WALK TO LAWRENCE LIKE A TRAMP ACTOR'S WAS OFF
2 IT WAS A CRUDE AND UNSATISFACTORY PIECE OF MECHANISM AND NECESSITATED DOUBLING OF THE BATTERY IN ORDER TO BRING IT INTO ACTION
DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINES OF A PRIMITIVE KIND HAD BEEN INVENTED AND WERE IN USE TO A VERY LIMITED EXTENT FOR ARC LIGHTING AND ELECTROPLATING FOR SOME YEARS PRIOR TO THE SUMMER OF 1819 WHEN EDISON WITH AN EMBRYONIC LIGHTING SYSTEM IN MIND CAST ABOUT FOR A TYPE OF MACHINE TECHNICALLY AND COMMERCIALLY SUITABLE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL CARRYING OUT OF HIS PLANS
AS TIME PASSED I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME ACTION OF THE PATENT OFFICE AS USUAL BUT NONE CAME
PRESIDENT DIAZ OF MEXICO VISITED THIS COUNTRY WITH MRS DIAZ A HIGHLY EDUCATED AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
HE WAS HOWEVER READY FOR ANYTHING NEW OR NOVEL AND NO RECORD CAN EVER BE MADE OR PRESENTED THAT WOULD DO JUSTICE TO A TITHE OF THE THOUGHTS AND FANCIES DAILY AND HOURLY PUT UPON THE RACK
THEN WE STARTED ANOTHER ENGINE AND THREW THEM IN PARALLEL
DEPRIVED OF THE USE OF A LARGE PART OF HER CELLAR TIRING OF THE MESS ALWAYS TO BE FOUND THERE AND SOMEWHAT FEARFUL OF RESULTS HIS MOTHER ONCE TOLD THE BOY TO CLEAR EVERYTHING OUT AND RESTORE ORDER
IT IS TRUE THAT MANY IMPORTANT INVENTIONS OF OTHERS HAVE A DISTINGUISHED PLACE IN THE ART AS IT IS EXPLOITED TODAY BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT THE BROAD ESSENTIALS SUCH AS THE INCANDESCENT LAMP SYSTEMS OF DISTRIBUTION AND SOME IMPORTANT DETAILS ARE NOT ONLY UNIVERSALLY USED BUT ARE AS NECESSARY TO-DAY FOR SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIAL PRACTICE AS THEY WERE WHEN EDISON INVENTED THEM MANY YEARS AGO
HENCE ALTHOUGH HIS CEMENT ENTERPRISE REACHED THE COMMERCIAL STAGE A LONG TIME AGO HE HAS BEEN FIRMLY CONVINCED OF HIS OWN ABILITY TO DEVISE STILL FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS AND ECONOMICAL PROCESSES OF GREATER OR LESS FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE AND HAS THEREFORE MADE A CONSTANT STUDY OF THE PROBLEM AS A WHOLE AND IN ALL ITS PARTS
IN THE BASEMENT HE HAD AN OFFICE
I HAD TWO HOOKS
QUOTING FROM THE SPECIFICATION ATTACHED TO THIS PATENT WE FIND THAT EDISON SAID
STARCH 5 LBS
MY FRIEND ADAMS WAS WORKING IN THE FRANKLIN TELEGRAPH COMPANY WHICH COMPETED WITH THE WESTERN UNION
BUT IF THROUGH THE SAME CIRCUIT BY MEANS OF ANOTHER KEY SUITABLY CONNECTED THERE IS SENT THE RAPID CHANGES IN CURRENT FROM AN INDUCTION-COIL IT WILL CAUSE A SERIES OF LOUD CLICKS IN THE TELEPHONE CORRESPONDING TO THE SIGNALS TRANSMITTED

IN ALL ROTARY KILNS FOR BURNING CEMENT THE TRUE CLINKERING OPERATION TAKES PLACE ONLY WITHIN A LIMITED PORTION OF THEIR TOTAL LENGTH WHERE THE HEAT IS GREATEST
UPTON IN FIFTEEN YEARS YOU WILL BE MAKING FORTY THOUSAND LAMPS A DAY NONE OF THOSE PRESENT VENTURED TO MAKE ANY REMARK ON THIS ASSERTION ALTHOUGH ALL FELT THAT IT WAS MERELY A RANDOM GUESS BASED ON THE SANGUINE DREAM OF AN INVENTOR
ALTHOUGH MR MOORE DID NOT MEET WITH THE EXCITING ADVENTURES OF SOME SUBSEQUENT EXPLORERS HE ENCOUNTERED NUMEROUS DIFFICULTIES AND NOVEL EXPERIENCES IN HIS MANY MONTHS OF TRAVEL THROUGH THE HINTERLAND OF JAPAN AND CHINA
WHEN THERE'S NO EXPERIMENTING THERE'S NO PROGRESS
OF THIS EPISODE EDISON GIVES THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT
THE PATH THROUGH THE TRACKLESS FOREST HAD BEEN BLAZED AND NOW EVERY ONE COULD FIND THE WAY
FROM THIS HE GETS THE SEED AND USES HIS SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE IN PRODUCING FROM IT A NUMBER OF NEW PLANTS WHICH ON DEVELOPMENT FURNISH THE MEANS OF PROPAGATING AN IMPROVED VARIETY IN LARGE QUANTITY
IT WAS TAKEN HOME TO GLENMONT
AFTER A TIME HE BROUGHT THE MASS TO EDISON AND SAID
SPEAKING OF THE PROBLEM INVOLVED EDISON SAID SOME YEARS LATER TO MR UPTON HIS MATHEMATICAL ASSISTANT THAT HE ALWAYS CONSIDERED HE WAS ONLY WORKING FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER
IT IS HERE THAT DIRECTORS MEETINGS ARE SOMETIMES HELD AND ALSO WHERE WEIGHTY MATTERS ARE OFTEN DISCUSSED BY EDISON AT CONFERENCE WITH HIS CLOSER ASSOCIATES
FERGUSON HAVE ALL BEEN AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER IN THE EDISON EMPLOY
NOW AND THEN HOWEVER THERE ARISES A MAN SO GREATLY ENDOWED WITH NATURAL POWERS AND ORIGINALITY THAT THE CREATIVE FACULTY WITHIN HIM IS TOO STRONG TO ENDURE THE HUMDRUM ROUTINE OF AFFAIRS AND MANIFESTS ITSELF IN A LIFE DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO THE EVOLUTION OF METHODS AND DEVICES CALCULATED TO FURTHER THE WORLD'S WELFARE
UP TO AND INCLUDING HIS TELEPHONE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH ENTERED INTO ALREADY EXISTING ARTS HAD BEEN MOSTLY PURCHASED BY THE WESTERN UNION AND OTHER COMPANIES AND WHILE THERE WAS MORE OR LESS CONTESTING OF HIS CLAIMS ESPECIALLY IN RESPECT OF THE TELEPHONE THE EXTENT OF SUCH LITIGATION WAS NOT SO CONSPICUOUSLY GREAT AS THAT WHICH CENTRED SUBSEQUENTLY AROUND HIS PATENTS COVERING INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTING AND POWER SYSTEMS
ARRIVED IN THAT CITY I WENT TO THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE GOT MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY A LITTLE SOLID FOOD AND SECURED A PASS TO LOUISVILLE
HE WAS BITTEN TOO NEAR THE TOP OF THE SPINAL COLUMN AND CAME TOO LATE EDISON HAS NO OPINION TO OFFER AS AN EXPERT ON ART BUT HAS HIS OWN STANDARD OF TASTE
AND IN ONE OF THE OPERATIONS WE USED TO TAKE THE LENGTH OF TUBING OUT OF THE WINDOW IN ORDER TO TURN IT AROUND
BUT AT THAT JUNCTURE A SERVANT-GIRL WHO HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARS WITH A FAMILY ON THE HEIGHTS IN BROOKLYN WENT MAD SUDDENLY AND HELD AN AGED WIDOW AND HER DAUGHTER AS HELPLESS PRISONERS FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER

AS THE WAR PROGRESSED THE DAILY NEWSPAPER SALES BECAME VERY PROFITABLE AND I GAVE UP THE VEGETABLE STORE THE HOURS OF THIS OCCUPATION WERE LONG BUT THE WORK WAS NOT PARTICULARLY HEAVY AND EDISON SOON FOUND OPPORTUNITY FOR HIS FAVORITE AVOCATION--CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTATION
WE HAD A TELEPHONE LINE RUNNING ACROSS THE ROOFS TO THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING

A MERITORIOUS EXCEPTION TO THE RULE OF THE LAST SECTION IS INVOLVED IN THE ADJUDICATED VALIDITY OF THE EDISON INCANDESCENT-LIGHT PATENT
AT THE TIME THIS ADJUNCT TO THE PLANT WAS REQUIRED THE BEST DRYER ON THE MARKET WAS OF A ROTARY TYPE WHICH HAD A CAPACITY OF ONLY TWENTY TONS PER HOUR WITH THE EXPENDITURE OF CONSIDERABLE POWER

TAKING THE ELECTRIC LIGHT INTO CONSIDERATION FIRST WE FIND THAT IN THE CENTRAL STATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE NOT LESS THAN AN AVERAGE OF 50,000 PERSONS EMPLOYED REQUIRING AN AGGREGATE YEARLY PAYROLL OF OVER $40,000,000
I COLLECTED TOO QUITE A LARGE SCRAP-BOOK OF IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY HAVE LOST IT EDISON TELLS AN AMUSING STORY OF HIS OWN PURSUITS AT THIS TIME
HE DESCRIBES THE BOY OF SIXTEEN AS ENGROSSED INTENSELY IN HIS EXPERIMENTS AND SCIENTIFIC READING AND SOMEWHAT INDIFFERENT FOR THIS REASON TO HIS DUTIES AS OPERATOR
THAT IS TO SAY ALTERNATELY REVERSING THE POLARITY OF THE BATTERIES AS APPLIED TO THE LINE AND THUS PRODUCING CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN THE POLARITY OF ANOTHER SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED TYPE OF RELAY CALLED A POLARIZED RELAY
NEWS IS VITAL TO WALL STREET AND THERE IS NO LIVING MAN ON WHOM THE DOINGS IN WALL STREET ARE WITHOUT EFFECT
THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP AHEAD OF THE PROCESSION IS TO EXPERIMENT
THE FIRST FLOOR IS DIVIDED OFF INTO TWO LARGE ROOMS--PARLOR AND LIVING-ROOM--AND THE UPPER FLOORS CONTAIN FOUR LARGE BEDROOMS A ROOMY BATH-ROOM AND WIDE HALLS

AND LATER HE ACTED AS LEGAL ADVISER TO HENRY VILLARD IN HIS NUMEROUS GRANDIOSE ENTERPRISES
AMONG OTHER FREQUENT VISITORS WAS MR EDISON'S FATHER ONE OF THOSE AMIABLE PATRIARCHAL CHARACTERS WITH A HORACE GREELEY BEARD TYPICAL AMERICANS OF THE OLD SCHOOL WHO WOULD SOMETIMES COME INTO THE LABORATORY WITH HIS TWO GRANDCHILDREN A LITTLE BOY AND GIRL CALLED DASH AND DOT HE PREFERRED TO SIT AND WATCH HIS BRILLIANT SON AT WORK WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SATISFACTION ON HIS FACE THAT INDICATED A SENSE OF HAPPINESS AND CONTENT THAT HIS BOY BORN IN THAT DISTANT HUMBLE HOME IN OHIO HAD RISEN TO FAME AND BROUGHT SUCH HONOR UPON THE NAME
APRIL 6 1883 370,124 MANUFACTURE OF FILAMENT FOR INCANDESCING ELECTRIC LAMP
THE MAGNET WIRE WAS WOUND WITH RAGS FOR INSULATION AND PIECES OF SPRING BRASS WERE USED FOR KEYS
HIS COMMERCIAL STRENGTH MANIFESTS ITSELF RATHER IN THE OUTLINING OF MATTERS RELATING TO ORGANIZATION AND BROAD POLICY WITH A SAGACITY ARISING FROM A SHREWD PERCEPTION AND APPRECIATION OF GENERAL BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS TO WHICH SHOULD BE ADDED HIS INTENSELY COMPREHENSIVE GRASP OF MANUFACTURING POSSIBILITIES AND DETAILS AND AN UNCEASING VIGILANCE IN DEVISING MEANS OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND INCREASING THE ECONOMY OF THEIR MANUFACTURE
IN THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK WHICH HAS SINCE MADE SUCH A PROFOUND IMPRESSION ON CONTEMPORARY LIFE

WE OWE TO MR MALLORY A CHARACTERISTIC STORY OF THIS PERIOD AS TO AN INCIDENTAL UNBENDING FROM TOIL WHICH IN ITSELF ILLUSTRATES THE EVER-PRESENT DETERMINATION TO CONQUER WHAT IS UNDERTAKEN
BESIDES HIS LEISURE HOURS IN DETROIT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEND AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
BUT THE TROUBLE WAS THAT THE BATTERY TOOK A LONG TIME TO FORM ONE SHEET BECOMING COATED WITH LEAD PEROXIDE AND THE OTHER WITH FINELY DIVIDED OR SPONGY METALLIC LEAD THEY WOULD RECEIVE CURRENT AND THEN EVEN AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF INACTION FURNISH OR RETURN AN ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE OF FROM 1.85 TO 2.2 VOLTS
HE REPORTED $3000
AND IN THIS FAMILY HAD I MOST HOPE OF FINDING THE DESIRED FIBRE

AS ONE OF THE AMERICAN JUDGES SAID IN DECIDING AN EARLY LITIGATION OVER THE INVENTION OF THE TELEPHONE A HUNDRED YEARS OF REIS WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THE WORLD THE TELEPHONIC ART FOR PUBLIC USE
TO ONE OF EDISON'S ENTHUSIASTIC SELF-CONFIDENCE THE LONG VISTA OF DIFFICULTIES AHEAD--WE SAY IT IN ALL SINCERITY--MUST HAVE BEEN ALLURING
THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS LITIGATION BECAME SO EXTENSIVE AND COMPLEX AS TO RENDER IT NECESSARY TO INSTITUTE A SPECIAL BUREAU OR DEPARTMENT THROUGH WHICH THE IMMENSE DETAIL COULD BE SYSTEMATICALLY SIFTED ANALYZED AND ARRANGED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE NUMEROUS EXPERTS AND COUNSEL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE VARIOUS CASES
AND THEN DISCOVERED THAT CALCULATIONS AS TO QUANTITY HAD BEEN THROWN OUT BECAUSE THE BOXES HAD ALL BEEN SCREWED DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND MOSTLY FILLED WITH BOARDS WITH A VENEER OF BRASS CHIPS
IT IS DESIGNED IN THESE PAGES TO BRING THE READER FACE TO FACE WITH EDISON
THE RATIO OF YIELD TO CONSUMPTION IS THE EXPRESSION OF THE EFFICIENCY OF THE MACHINE
THE ELECTRICIAN ON ACCOUNT OF THE TESTIMONY INVOLVED LOST HIS GLORY
NOWADAYS THE HOUSE ORGAN AS IT IS CALLED HAS BECOME A VERY HACKNEYED FEATURE OF INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CONFUSING IN ITS VARIETY AND VOLUME AND A SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL ADJUNCT TO A HIGHLY PERFECTED WIDELY CIRCULATING PERIODICAL TECHNICAL PRESS
THE GRIZZLY WAS KILLED IN FIVE MINUTES AND SO THE SCHEME DIED
I COULD UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I NEVER COULD GET IT THROUGH ME WHAT WENT THROUGH THE DOG OR OVER THE WIRE TO-DAY MR EDISON IS JUST AS UNABLE TO SOLVE THE INNER MYSTERY OF ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION
BELT-DRIVEN GENERATORS AND ENGINES WERE SPEEDILY INSTALLED AND THE STATION WAS AGAIN IN OPERATION IN A FEW DAYS

IT WAS ON THE SECOND STORY OF A DILAPIDATED BUILDING ON THE PRINCIPAL STREET OF THE CITY WITH THE BATTERY-ROOM IN THE REAR
EDISON'S INVENTION WAS PRACTICALLY MADE WHEN HE ASCERTAINED THE THERETOFORE UNKNOWN FACT THAT CARBON WOULD STAND HIGH TEMPERATURE EVEN WHEN VERY ATTENUATED IF OPERATED IN A HIGH VACUUM WITHOUT THE PHENOMENON OF DISINTEGRATION
STATED VERY BRIEFLY EDISON'S PRINCIPAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE AUTOMATIC WAS BASED ON THE OBSERVATION THAT IN A LINE OF CONSIDERABLE LENGTH ELECTRICAL IMPULSES BECOME ENORMOUSLY EXTENDED OR SLUGGISH DUE TO A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS SELF-INDUCTION WHICH WITH ORDINARY MORSE WORK IS IN A MEASURE CORRECTED BY CONDENSERS
TWO OR THREE THOUSAND OF THE FIRST EXPERIMENTS FOLLOWED THE LINE OF HIS WELL-KNOWN PRIMARY BATTERY IN THE ATTEMPTED EMPLOYMENT OF COPPER OXIDE AS AN ELEMENT IN A NEW TYPE OF STORAGE CELL

WITH EDISON'S TELEPHONE THE BATTERY CURRENT DOES NOT FLOW ON THE MAIN LINE BUT PASSES THROUGH THE PRIMARY CIRCUIT OF AN INDUCTION-COIL FROM THE SECONDARY OF WHICH CORRESPONDING IMPULSES OF ENORMOUSLY HIGHER POTENTIAL ARE SENT OUT ON THE MAIN LINE TO THE RECEIVING END
SOME INVENTORS OF THE GREATEST ABILITY DEALING WITH IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS OF IMPORTANCE HAVE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ORGANIZE OR EVEN TO TOLERATE A STAFF OF CO-WORKERS PREFERRING SOLITARY AND SECRET TOIL INCAPABLE OF TEAM WORK OR JEALOUS OF ANY INTRUSION THAT COULD POSSIBLY BAR THEM FROM A FULL AND COMPLETE CLAIM TO THE RESULT WHEN OBTAINED

THEN THEY WOULD GO AS FAR AS THEY LIKED
HE SAID HE WAS SUFFERING VERY MUCH AND ASKED IF I HAD ANY MORPHINE
OH YES HE SAID I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUARTS MORE UP AT THE HOUSE ALL THIS SOUNDS LIKE LACK OF APPRECIATION BUT IT IS ANYTHING ELSE THAN THAT
ITS TRANSMITTING MACHINE WAS DRIVEN BY A SMALL ELECTROMAGNETIC MOTOR
GAME WAS IN GREAT ABUNDANCE AND COULD BE SEEN ALL DAY LONG FROM THE CAR WINDOW ESPECIALLY ANTELOPE
OTHER PEOPLE ABROAD ASK HELP IN LOCATING LOST RELATIVES
FIX IT

THAT HE DID NOT GO WAS CERTAINLY BETTER FOR SCOTTISH VERSE TO WHICH HE CONTRIBUTED LATER SO MANY IMMORTAL LINES
BUT THE LOCALITY IN WHICH THESE SPECIMENS WERE FOUND WAS LOST IN THE LIMITLESS REACHES OF THOSE GREAT RIVER-BOTTOMS
1 AND ITS EXPLANATION FROM WHICH IT APPEARS THAT THE POLARITY OF A SOFT-IRON BAR IS DETERMINED NOT BY THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT FLOWING AROUND IT BUT BY THE DIRECTION THEREOF
AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURING INDEPENDENT INDIVIDUAL CONTROL OF EACH UNIT TO DIVIDE EACH MAIN CIRCUIT INTO ANY DESIRED NUMBER OF DERIVED CIRCUITS OF STANDARD POTENTIAL PROPERLY BALANCED BY MEANS OF A CENTRAL COMPENSATING CONDUCTOR WHICH WOULD BE NORMALLY NEUTRAL BUT DESIGNED TO CARRY ANY MINOR EXCESS OF CURRENT THAT MIGHT FLOW BY REASON OF ANY TEMPORARY UNBALANCING OF EITHER SIDE OF THE MAIN CIRCUIT
SOME YEARS AGO MR W
THUS THE MODERN EDISON PHONOGRAPH MADE ITS MODEST DEBUT IN 1888 IN WHAT WAS THEN CALLED THE IMPROVED FORM TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE ORIGINAL STYLE OF MACHINE HE INVENTED IN 1877 IN WHICH THE RECORD WAS MADE ON A SHEET OF TIN-FOIL HELD IN PLACE UPON A METALLIC CYLINDER
HE REPORTED RESULTS EVERY DAY AND RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS BY MAIL
IN THE LABORATORY NOTE-BOOKS THERE ARE RECORDED THOUSANDS OF EXPERIMENTS SHOWING THAT EDISON'S INVESTIGATIONS NOT ONLY INCLUDED AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF CHEMICAL SALTS AND COMPOUNDS BUT ALSO AN EXHAUSTIVE VARIETY OF PLANTS FLOWERS ROOTS HERBS AND BARKS
WE WORKED CONTINUOUSLY ALL THROUGH THAT SATURDAY NIGHT AND ALL DAY SUNDAY UNTIL EVENING WHEN WE FINISHED THE JOB
AS A BASIS OF COMPARISON A DISTRICT OF THIRTY-SIX CITY BLOCKS IN THE FORM OF A SQUARE WAS ASSUMED
AN INCANDESCENT LAMP IS SUCH A SIMPLE-APPEARING ARTICLE--MERELY A FILAMENT SEALED INTO A GLASS GLOBE--THAT ITS INTRINSIC RELATION TO THE ART OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING IS FAR FROM BEING APPARENT AT SIGHT
IT HAS NO COUNTERPART IN THE WORLD
IN A CONVERSATION WITH TWO OLD ASSOCIATES RECENTLY APRIL 1909 HE REMARKED
THEY TREATED HIM FOR TWO WEEKS FOR YELLOW FEVER
THE SAND BATTERY IS NOW OBSOLETE
A YEAR OR DOUBLING EVERY TEN YEARS
IN REPLY TO THIS PERTINENT CRITICISM IT MAY BE POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS A LIFE OF EDISON AND NOT OF ANY ONE ELSE
SPECIFICATIONS HAD BEEN DRAWN AND I HAD SIGNED AND SWORN TO THE APPLICATION FOR PATENTS FOR THESE SEVENTY-EIGHT INVENTIONS AND NATURALLY I SUPPOSED THEY HAD BEEN FILED IN THE REGULAR WAY
DEPRECIATION ON MACHINERY THE PLANT CHARGE IS APPROXIMATELY $140 PER HOUSE
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED A FANTASTIC EXTRAVAGANCE
THE NATIVE SIMPLICITY OF THE MAN THE ABSENCE OF POSE AND CEREMONY DO MUCH TO STRENGTHEN THIS NOTION
THE DILEMMA IS ENCOUNTERED BY CENTRAL STATIONS IN A BEWILDERED WAY AS A NOVEL AND UNEXPECTED EXPERIENCE
AND IN ENGLAND WHEN A CASE IS ONCE FINALLY DECIDED IT IS SETTLED FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY WHILE HERE IT IS NOT SO
AND THIS FACT ALSO WAS OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE IN MAKING SUCCESSFUL THE FINAL USE OF CARBON BECAUSE WITHOUT THE SUBJECTION OF THE CARBON TO THE HEATING EFFECT OF CURRENT DURING THE FORMATION OF THE VACUUM THE PRESENCE OF OCCLUDED GASES WOULD HAVE BEEN A FATAL OBSTACLE
APPLICATION FILED AUGUST 24 1891
NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION WAS A SMALL SALOON KEPT BY AN OLD SCOTCHMAN NAMED DAVIS WHERE BILLIARDS WERE PLAYED IN IDLE MOMENTS AND WHERE IN THE LONG WINTER EVENINGS THE HOT STOVE WAS A CENTRE OF ATTRACTION TO LOUNGERS AND STORY-TELLERS

THESE WERE SEIZED AND THROWN OUT OF THE WINDOW AND I WAS TOLD TO GET MY MONEY OF NICODEMUS
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS INSTALLATION WAS NOT COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL AS THERE WERE A GREAT MANY TROUBLES
THE MERE FACT THAT EDISON SPENT YEARS OF HIS LIFE IN DEVELOPING THAT PROCESS COUNTED FOR NOTHING
ROTTEN
THIS INSTRUMENT WAS VERY SIMPLE AND PRACTICAL AND ANY ONE COULD WORK IT AFTER A FEW MINUTES EXPLANATION

I BELIEVE MY MILL WAS THE FIRST LIGHTED WITH YOUR ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THEREFORE MAY BE CALLED NO
THE WHOLE STRUCTURE WAS SET ON A PIVOT SO THAT IT COULD BE SWUNG AROUND WITH THE SUN
AND THE FAITHFUL JOHN KRUESI WAS GIVEN CHARGE OF THAT BRANCH OF PRODUCTION
I CONSTRUCTED AN INSTRUMENT THAT WOULD RECORD THE SOUND AND SET OUT TO MAKE A PRELIMINARY REPORT BUT I FOUND THAT THEY NEVER INTENDED TO DO ANYTHING BUT LET THE PEOPLE COMPLAIN IT WAS UPON THE CO-OPERATION OF VILLARD THAT EDISON FELL BACK AND AN AGREEMENT WAS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THEM ON SEPTEMBER 14 1881 WHICH PROVIDED THAT THE LATTER WOULD BUILD TWO AND A HALF MILES OF ELECTRIC RAILWAY AT MENLO PARK EQUIPPED WITH THREE CARS TWO LOCOMOTIVES ONE FOR FREIGHT AND ONE FOR PASSENGERS CAPACITY OF LATTER SIXTY MILES AN HOUR

TRULY A PRODIGIOUS UNDERTAKING IN THOSE DARK DAYS WHEN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF EDISON'S LARGE EXPERIENCE THE MOST PRACTICAL AND CORRECT ELECTRICAL TREATISE WAS CONTAINED IN THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA AND IN A GERMAN PUBLICATION WHICH MR UPTON HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AFTER HE HAD FINISHED HIS STUDIES WITH THE ILLUSTRIOUS HELMHOLTZ
NOTWITHSTANDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGULAR ROUTINE OF MANUFACTURE AND SALE EDISON DID NOT CEASE TO EXPERIMENT FOR IMPROVEMENT
THE WHOLE LOT RODS AND ROPE WHEN READY FOR TUBE SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER COAT AND THEN BE PLACED IN TUBE AND FILLED
IN 1887 HIS TIME WAS COMPARATIVELY FREE AND THE PHONOGRAPH WAS THEN TAKEN UP WITH RENEWED ENERGY AND THE EFFORT MADE TO OVERCOME ITS MECHANICAL DEFECTS AND TO FURNISH A COMMERCIAL INSTRUMENT SO THAT ITS EARLY PROMISE MIGHT BE REALIZED
HIS PERSISTENCE AND PROFOUND CONVICTION OF THE ULTIMATE RESULTS WERE SO STRONG AND HIS ARGUMENTS SO SOUND HOWEVER THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS ENTERED UPON
BY-AND-BY AFTER AN ANXIOUS SEARCH HIS FATHER FOUND HIM SITTING IN A NEST HE HAD MADE IN THE BARN FILLED WITH GOOSE-EGGS AND HENS EGGS HE HAD COLLECTED TRYING TO HATCH THEM OUT
THESE MANY ADVANTAGES COMBINED WITH LOFTY CEILINGS ON EVERY FLOOR PROVIDE IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF WORKING PEOPLE ENGAGED IN THIS IMMENSE PLANT
IN THIS CASE THERE IS ALSO A TRANSLATION OF THE ENERGY BUT HERE IT ACCOMPLISHES A USEFUL PURPOSE AS THE ENERGY IS CONVERTED INTO THE FORM OF LIGHT THROUGH THE INCANDESCENCE OF THE FILAMENT

IN THE SKETCH FIG
EDISON HAS ALWAYS BEEN DEEPLY INTERESTED IN CONSERVATION AND MUCH OF HIS WORK HAS BEEN DIRECTED TOWARD THE ECONOMY OF FUEL IN OBTAINING ELECTRICAL ENERGY DIRECTLY FROM THE CONSUMPTION OF COAL
HE DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE WISE TO MAKE THE TRIAL OPERATION OF A SECOND JUMBO ON A SUNDAY WHEN BUSINESS HOUSES WERE CLOSED IN THE DISTRICT THUS OBVIATING ANY DANGER OF FALSE IMPRESSIONS IN THE PUBLIC MIND IN THE EVENT OF ANY EXTRAORDINARY MANIFESTATIONS

PLEASE CUT IT UP INTO LENGTHS AND TEST EACH ONE AND SEND RESULTS TO ME IMMEDIATELY POSSIBLY THE ELECTRICAL FRATERNITY DOES NOT REALIZE THAT THIS EARNEST WORK OF EDISON TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS AGO RESULTED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HIGH QUALITY OF COPPER WIRE THAT HAS BEEN THE RECOGNIZED STANDARD SINCE THAT TIME
IN OTHER WORDS THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE IS THAT WITH BELL'S TELEPHONE THE SOUND-WAVES THEMSELVES GENERATE THE ELECTRIC IMPULSES WHICH ARE THEREFORE EXTREMELY FAINT
BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT THE INSTANCES IN WHICH THESE PARTS WOULD FIT WERE VERY FEW
AND THE WRITER IS INCLINED TO THE OPINION THAT THIS VIBRATION ACTING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE ACTION OF GRAVITATION WHICH WAS ONE OF THE TWO CONTROLLING FORCES IN THE OPERATION OF THE PORTER-ALLEN GOVERNOR WAS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE HUNTING IN THE ARMINGTON SIMS ENGINE THE CONTROLLING FORCES IN THE OPERATION OF THE GOVERNOR WERE THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE OF REVOLVING WEIGHTS AND THE OPPOSING FORCE OF COMPRESSED SPRINGS AND NEITHER THE ACTION OF GRAVITATION NOR THE VERTICAL VIBRATIONS OF THE ENGINE COULD HAVE ANY SENSIBLE EFFECT UPON THE GOVERNOR THE PEARL STREET STATION AS THIS FIRST LARGE PLANT WAS CALLED MADE RAPID AND CONTINUOUS GROWTH IN ITS OUTPUT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT
AND HE SOON LONGED FOR THE LARGER TELEGRAPHIC OPPORTUNITY OF NEW YORK
I SHUT MY EYES AND PULLED BUT THE NITRIC ACID SPLASHED ALL OVER MY FACE AND RAN DOWN MY BACK
NO REAL SUCCESS WAS ATTAINED IN THAT DIRECTION AND FOR MANY YEARS THE CARBON-FILAMENT LAMP REIGNED SUPREME
IN THE DEMONSTRATING PLANT INSTALLED AND OPERATED BY HIM AT MENLO PARK IN 1880 TEN DYNAMOS OF EIGHT HORSE-POWER EACH WERE DRIVEN BY A SLOW-SPEED ENGINE THROUGH A COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF COUNTER-SHAFTING AND TO QUOTE FROM MR CLARKE'S HISTORICAL REVIEW IT WAS FOUND THAT A CONSIDERABLE PERCENTAGE OF THE POWER OF THE ENGINE WAS NECESSARILY WASTED IN FRICTION BY THIS METHOD OF DRIVING AND TO PREVENT THIS WASTE AND THUS INCREASE THE ECONOMY OF HIS SYSTEM MR EDISON CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF SUBSTITUTING A SINGLE LARGE DYNAMO FOR THE SEVERAL SMALL DYNAMOS AND DIRECTLY COUPLING IT WITH THE DRIVING ENGINE AND AT THE SAME TIME PRESERVE THE REQUISITE HIGH ARMATURE SPEED BY USING AN ENGINE OF THE HIGH-SPEED TYPE
THE TIES THAT BIND ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM IN TWINSHIP OF RELATION AND INTERACTION WERE DETECTED AND FARADAY'S WORK IN INDUCTION GAVE THE WORLD AT ONCE THE DYNAMO AND THE MOTOR
THIS APPARENT DULNESS IS HOWEVER A QUITE COMMON INCIDENT TO YOUTHFUL GENIUS
BOILERS ENGINES DYNAMOS MOTORS DISTRIBUTION MAINS METERS HOUSE-WIRING SAFETY-DEVICES LAMPS AND LAMP-FIXTURES--ALL WERE VITAL PARTS OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM
AFTER RUNNING ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES THE FIREMAN COULDN'T KEEP HIS EYES OPEN THIS EVENT FOLLOWED AN ALL-NIGHT DANCE OF THE TRAINMEN'S FRATERNAL ORGANIZATION AND HE AGREED TO PERMIT ME TO RUN THE ENGINE

EDISON'S WHOLE METHOD OF WORK WOULD UPSET THE SYSTEM OF ANY OFFICE
ON THE RECEIPT OF THE NEWS OF HIS DEATH HALF A DOZEN OF THE MEN WANTED HIS JOB BUT MY SEARCHER IN THE ASTOR LIBRARY REPORTED THAT THE CHANCES OF FINDING THE RIGHT KIND OF BAMBOO FOR LAMPS IN CUBA WERE VERY SMALL
THIS HE SOON GOT TIRED OF AND I LOST SIGHT OF HIM ADAMS IN SPEAKING OF THIS EPISODE SAYS THAT WHEN HE ASKED FOR TRANSPORTATION EXPENSES TO ST LOUIS EDISON PULLED OUT OF HIS POCKET A FERRY TICKET TO HOBOKEN AND SAID TO HIS ASSOCIATES

COAL-TAR OR PITCH 10 LBS
AND WHO AFTERWARD AS AN ASSOCIATE OF ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL ENJOYED THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE FIRST MANUFACTURER IN THE WORLD OF TELEPHONES
WHEN HE REACHED THIS PERIOD I GAVE ORDERS FOR THE ENGINE-WORKS TO RUN NIGHT AND DAY UNTIL WE GOT ENOUGH ENGINES AND WHEN ALL WAS READY WE STARTED THE ENGINES
NO PLASTER IS USED ANYWHERE
EDISON'S LIGHTING WORK FURNISHED AN EXCELLENT BASIS--IN FACT THE ONLY ONE--FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT NOW SO GENERALLY EMPLOYED IN CENTRAL-STATION WORK IN AMERICA
2 1888 382,418 PHONOGRAM BLANK
THE FACTORY WORK AT THIS TIME RELATED CHIEFLY TO STOCK TICKERS PRINCIPALLY THE UNIVERSAL OF WHICH AT ONE TIME TWELVE HUNDRED WERE IN USE
BUT IF WE PAUSE TO CONSIDER THAT THE COMMERCIAL SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT WHICH WAS VIRTUALLY AN INVENTION MADE TO ORDER INVOLVED THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS SO UNPRECEDENTED THAT EVEN THEY THEMSELVES HAD TO BE CREATED WE CANNOT BUT CONCLUDE THAT THE AFFLATUS OF INNATE GENIUS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE UNIQUE METHODS OF INVESTIGATION INSTITUTED BY EDISON AT THAT AND OTHER TIMES
THE MOMENT THE HORSE STRUCK THE ELECTRIFIED SOIL HE STOOD STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR AND THEN REARED AGAIN
I FELT LIKE ALEXANDER THE GREAT!--I HAD NO MORE CHANCE
IT APPEARS FROM THE PAPER THAT TWENTY-THREE EDISON STATIONS WERE THEN EQUIPPED WITH 5187 METERS WHICH WERE RELIED UPON FOR BILLING THE MONTHLY CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF 87,856 LAMPS AND 350 MOTORS OF 1000 HORSE-POWER TOTAL
SOME ARE OCCUPIED IN FARMING AND GRAPE CULTURE
THIS WAS IN 1863
SHEPARD READ A PAPER ON THE METER PRACTICE OF THE NEW YORK EDISON COMPANY GIVING DATA AS TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF EDISON METERS IN USE AND THE TRANSITION TO OTHER TYPES OF WHICH TO-DAY THE COMPANY HAS SEVERAL ON ITS CIRCUITS
THE PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED WAS TO MARKET AN AGGLOMERATED MATERIAL SO AS TO AVOID THE DRAWBACKS OF FINE ORE
THE MACHINERY FOR ACCOMPLISHING THIS RESULT REPRESENTS ANOTHER INTERESTING AND RADICAL DEPARTURE OF EDISON FROM ACCEPTED USAGE
TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH EDISON ON TELEPHONE APPARATUS AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALTIES IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WOOSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METERS SAFETY FUSES AND NUMEROUS OTHER DETAILS
THE PATENT IS ABOUT AS BROAD AS A PATENT CAN BE BEING REGARDLESS OF SPECIFIC DEVICES AND LAYING A POWERFUL GRASP ON THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA OF MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION FROM A NUMBER OF GENERATORS THROUGHOUT A METALLIC CIRCUIT MR EDISON MADE A NUMBER OF OTHER APPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS ON ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION DURING THE YEAR 1880
A VISITOR TO THIS UPPER FLOOR OF THE LABORATORY BUILDING CANNOT BUT BE IMPRESSED WITH A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE INCESSANT EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING MADE TO IMPROVE THE REPRODUCING QUALITIES OF THE PHONOGRAPH AS HE HEARS FROM ALL SIDES THE SOUNDS OF VOCAL AND INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC CONSTANTLY VARYING IN VOLUME AND TIMBRE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE EXPERIMENTAL DEVICES UNDER TRIAL

BUT NOTHING OF SUFFICIENT MOMENT TO INTERFERE WITH THE STEADY AND CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF CURRENT TO CUSTOMERS AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY AND NIGHT
TO SOME EXTENT THERE HAS BEEN A POPULAR NOTION THAT MANY OF EDISON'S SUCCESSES HAVE BEEN DUE TO MERE DUMB FOOL LUCK--TO BLIND FORTUITOUS HAPPENINGS NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH FOR ON THE CONTRARY IT IS OWING ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE COMPREHENSIVE SCOPE OF HIS KNOWLEDGE THE BREADTH OF HIS CONCEPTION THE DARING ORIGINALITY OF HIS METHODS AND MINUTENESS AND EXTENT OF EXPERIMENT COMBINED WITH UNWAVERING PERTINACITY THAT NEW ARTS HAVE BEEN CREATED AND ADDITIONS MADE TO OTHERS ALREADY IN EXISTENCE
THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THE PATENTS AND INVENTIONS COVERING HIS ELECTRIC-LIGHTING SYSTEM THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY IN WHICH EDISON WAS LARGELY INTERESTED AS A STOCKHOLDER THUS FOUND AT THE OUTSET THAT ITS COMMERCIAL POSITION WAS IMPERILLED BY THE ACTIVITY OF COMPETITORS WHO HAD SPRUNG UP LIKE MUSHROOMS
ABOUT TEN FEET AWAY WE APPLIED THE WIRE TO THE BACK OF THE NECK AND IT GIVES A HORRIBLE SENSATION SHOWING THE VIBRATIONS CONDUCTED THROUGH THE WIRE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT ILLUSTRATES NOTABLY THE MOVEMENT OF THE ELECTRIC WAVES THROUGH FREE SPACE
REFERENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE TO THE WORK ABROAD IN PARIS AND LONDON
WE ALL THOUGHT SOMETHING HAD GOT INTO HIS WHISKEY-ROOM AND DIED

ALTHOUGH THE LARGEST OF THE CONCRETE BUILDINGS WHERE ITS MANUFACTURE IS CARRIED ON IS OVER FOUR HUNDRED FEET LONG AND FOUR STORIES IN HEIGHT IT HAS ALREADY BECOME NECESSARY TO PLAN EXTENSIONS AND ENLARGEMENTS OF THE PLANT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BATTERIES TO FILL THE PRESENT DEMANDS
ONE DAY I EXHIBITED AND WORKED A SUCCESSFUL DEVICE WHEREBY IF A TICKER SHOULD GET OUT OF UNISON IN A BROKER'S OFFICE AND COMMENCE TO PRINT WILD FIGURES IT COULD BE BROUGHT TO UNISON FROM THE CENTRAL STATION WHICH SAVED THE LABOR OF MANY MEN AND MUCH TROUBLE TO THE BROKER
EDISON THEREFORE STARTED FIRST OF ALL A LAMP FACTORY IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS AT MENLO PARK EQUIPPED IT WITH NOVEL MACHINERY AND APPARATUS AND BEGAN TO INSTRUCT MEN BOYS AND GIRLS AS THEY COULD BE ENLISTED IN THE ABSOLUTELY NEW ART PUTTING MR UPTON IN CHARGE

IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE WAS AT WORK AND WAS ABLE TO LIVE IN A NORMAL MANNER DURING THE CIVIL WAR WITH ITS ENORMOUS INCREASE IN THE NATIONAL DEBT AND THE VOLUME OF PAPER MONEY GOLD HAD GONE TO A HIGH PREMIUM
THE TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS OF HEAT AND THE PROHIBITIVE QUANTITIES OF COPPER THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR CONDUCTORS FOR SUCH LAMPS WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION IN COMMERCIAL PRACTICE
IT WAS ONLY DURING THE PAST SUMMER 1910 THAT ONE OF THE WRITERS SPENT A SUNDAY WITH HIM RIDING OVER THE BEAUTIFUL NEW JERSEY ROADS IN AN AUTOMOBILE EDISON IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS AND POINTING OUT WITH THE KEENEST ENJOYMENT THE MANY BEAUTIFUL VIEWS OF VALLEY AND WOOD
IT WAS JUST AT THE CHANGE OF SHIFT IN THE OFFICE
THE SECOND NIGHT HE WAS THERE HE COULD NOT STAND THE LONG HOURS AND FELL ASLEEP ON A SOFA
AND ALL THE LETTERS WANTED TO WANDER OUT OF LINE
ELECTRIC MACHINES CONVERT MECHANICAL INTO ELECTRICAL ENERGY
IT MAY ALSO BE SAID THAT ONCE ENTERING IT MR EDISON HAS NEVER ABANDONED ANY FIELD OF WORK
AN EXPERT CLERK COULD PERFORATE SUCH A TAPE AT THE RATE OF FIFTY TO SIXTY WORDS PER MINUTE

HE WOULD USE SEVERAL VOLUMES OF WATTS'S DICTIONARY OF CHEMISTRY FOR A PILLOW AND WE FELLOWS USED TO SAY THAT HE ABSORBED THE CONTENTS DURING HIS SLEEP JUDGING FROM THE FLOW OF NEW IDEAS HE HAD ON WAKING SUCH INCIDENTS AS THESE SERVE MERELY TO ILLUSTRATE THE LIGHTER MOMENTS THAT STAND OUT IN RELIEF AGAINST THE MORE SOMBRE BACKGROUND OF THE STRENUOUS YEARS FOR OF ALL THE ABSORBINGLY BUSY PERIODS OF EDISON'S INVENTIVE LIFE THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE STORAGE-BATTERY ERA WAS ONE OF THE VERY BUSIEST OF THEM ALL
THIS IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST COMPOUND WIRE MADE FOR TELEGRAPHIC OR OTHER SIGNALLING PURPOSES THE OBJECT BEING TO SECURE GREATER LIGHTNESS WITH TEXTILE STRENGTH AND HIGH CONDUCTIVITY
BUT IN HIS DAILY TOURS THROUGH THE LABORATORY KEEPS IN TOUCH WITH ALL THE WORK THAT IS UNDER THE HANDS OF HIS VARIOUS ASSISTANTS SHOWING BY AN INSTANT GRASP OF THE PRESENT CONDITIONS OF ANY EXPERIMENT THAT HE HAS A FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF ITS MEANING AND ITS REFERENCE TO HIS ORIGINAL CONCEPTION
FINALLY WHEN I THOUGHT THE FUN HAD GONE FAR ENOUGH AND HAVING ABOUT COMPLETED THE SPECIAL I QUIETLY OPENED THE KEY AND REMARKED TELEGRAPHICALLY TO MY NEW YORK FRIEND

NOT ONLY WERE THE ORDINARY STRIP PAPER CARBONS TRIED AGAIN BUT TISSUE-PAPER COATED WITH TAR AND LAMPBLACK WAS ROLLED INTO THIN STICKS LIKE KNITTING-NEEDLES CARBONIZED AND RAISED TO INCANDESCENCE IN VACUO
BUT WITH THE PASSING OF YEARS AND ENLARGEMENT OF HIS INTERESTS IT BECAME THE PRACTICE TO MAKE ALL ORIGINAL LABORATORY NOTES IN LARGE UNIFORM BOOKS
I NOTICED HE SAYS AN IMMENSE CROWD GATHERING IN THE STREET OUTSIDE A NEWSPAPER OFFICE
THIS INCIDENT LED TO AN EXTENSION OF THE PROTECTIVE IDEA AND VERY SOON A SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED IN BROOKLYN WITH ONE HUNDRED SUBSCRIBERS
IN FACT HE DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE STATION ANYWAY
EDISON'S ASSERTIONS WERE TREATED WITH SCEPTICISM BY THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD WHICH WAS NOT THEN READY FOR THE DISCOVERY AND NOT SUFFICIENTLY FURNISHED WITH CORROBORATIVE DATA

THIS AUTOMATIC ELECTROCUTING DEVICE ATTRACTED SO MUCH ATTENTION AND GOT HALF A COLUMN IN AN EVENING PAPER THAT THE MANAGER MADE ME STOP IT THE READER WILL REMEMBER THAT A SIMILAR PLAN OF CAMPAIGN AGAINST RATS WAS CARRIED OUT BY EDISON WHILE IN THE WEST
HIS VOLUMINOUS NOTE-BOOKS ARE A MASS OF SKETCHES

EDISON'S MAIL LIKE THAT OF MOST WELL-KNOWN MEN IS EXTREMELY LARGE BUT COMPOSED IN NO SMALL DEGREE OF LETTERS--THOUSANDS OF THEM YEARLY--THAT CONCERN ONLY THE WRITERS AND MIGHT WELL GO TO THE WASTE-PAPER BASKET WITHOUT PROLONGED CONSIDERATION
HIS STUDY OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT HIM TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN SUBSTATION ALTHOUGH THE TWISTS THAT LATER EVOLUTIONS HAVE GIVEN THE IDEA HAVE LEFT IT SCARCELY RECOGNIZABLE
IT WAS A VERY COMMON THING FOR EDISON TO WRITE THE WORDS YES OR NO AND THIS WOULD BE ALL I HAD ON WHICH TO BASE MY ANSWER

ALTHOUGH HE HAS NOT GIVEN ANY ATTENTION TO THE SUBJECT OF GENERATORS FOR MANY YEARS AN INTERESTING INSTANCE OF HIS INCISIVE METHOD OF OVERCOMING MINOR DIFFICULTIES OCCURRED WHILE THE PRESENT VOLUMES WERE UNDER PREPARATION 1909 CARBON FOR COMMUTATOR BRUSHES HAS BEEN SUPERSEDED BY GRAPHITE IN SOME CASES THE LATTER MATERIAL BEING FOUND MUCH MORE ADVANTAGEOUS ELECTRICALLY
THE CHALK TELEPHONE WAS FINALLY DISCARDED IN FAVOR OF THE BELL RECEIVER--THE LATTER BEING MORE SIMPLE AND CHEAPER
IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT ELECTROMAGNETS WERE THE TICKER'S ACTUATING AGENCY
ANOTHER NOTABLE USE OF THE ELECTROMOTOGRAPH PRINCIPLE WAS IN ITS ADAPTATION TO THE RECEIVER IN EDISON'S LOUD-SPEAKING TELEPHONE ON WHICH UNITED STATES PATENT NO
THE INSTRUCTION-BOOK PREPARED FOR THE USE OF INSPECTORS STATED THAT THE PARTS SHOULD NOT BE TINKERED NOR BENT AS THEY ARE ACCURATELY MADE AND INTERCHANGEABLE THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN FITTING THEM PROPERLY DOUBTLESS GAVE RISE TO A STORY THAT MR EDISON HAD STATED THAT THERE WERE THREE DEGREES OF INTERCHANGEABILITY
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT
SOME TIME PRIOR TO 1877 EDISON HAD BEEN EXPERIMENTING ON AN AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH IN WHICH THE LETTERS WERE FORMED BY EMBOSSING STRIPS OF PAPER WITH THE PROPER ARRANGEMENT OF DOTS AND DASHES
IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE MANY VISITS TO DISCOVER THAT IN THIS ROOM ALSO EDISON HAS A FAVORITE NOOK
WE MOVED THE LAMP WORKS FROM MENLO PARK TO HARRISON
HE CALLED ME ON THE LINE AND ASKED ME TO COME TO THE STAGE AND EXPLAIN THE MYSTERIES OF THE MORSE SYSTEM
AND LARGE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY WERE THUS OF NO VALUE
THAT HIS EFFORTS WERE NOT LIMITED IN EXTENT MAY BE INFERRED FROM THE FACT THAT SINCE THE FALL OF 1887 TO THE PRESENT WRITING HE HAS BEEN GRANTED IN THE UNITED STATES ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR PATENTS RELATING TO THE PHONOGRAPH AND ITS ACCESSORIES
EVERY ITEM BEARS TESTIMONY TO THE RAPID PROGRESS BEING MADE
ON THE TRAIN THE MATTER OF THE FUTURE WAS DISCUSSED AND MR EDISON SAID THAT INASMUCH AS WE HAD THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE CONCENTRATING PROBLEM WE MUST IF POSSIBLE APPLY IT TO SOME PRACTICAL USE AND AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST WORK OUT SOME OTHER PLANS BY WHICH WE COULD MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY OFF THE CONCENTRATING COMPANY'S INDEBTEDNESS MR EDISON STATING MOST POSITIVELY THAT NO COMPANY WITH WHICH HE HAD PERSONALLY BEEN ACTIVELY CONNECTED HAD EVER FAILED TO PAY ITS DEBTS AND HE DID NOT PROPOSE TO HAVE THE CONCENTRATING COMPANY ANY EXCEPTION
BUT IN THE GRASP OF THE IDEA HE WAS PRECEDED BY CHARLES BOURSEUL A YOUNG FRENCH SOLDIER IN ALGERIA WHO IN 1854 UNDER THE TITLE OF ELECTRICAL TELEPHONY IN A PARISIAN ILLUSTRATED PAPER GAVE A BRIEF AND LUCID DESCRIPTION AS FOLLOWS
BROADLY DESCRIBED IN OUTLINE THE SYSTEM CONSISTED OF AN INDUCTION CIRCUIT OBTAINED BY LAYING STRIPS OF TIN ALONG THE TOP OR ROOF OF A RAILWAY CAR AND THE INSTALLATION OF A SPECIAL TELEGRAPH LINE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE TRACK AND STRUNG ON POLES OF ONLY MEDIUM HEIGHT
I REMEMBER SOME LARGE PIPES AND ESPECIALLY A MOLASSES JUG A TRUNK AND SEVERAL OTHER THINGS THAT CAME FROM HOLLAND JOHN EDISON WAS LONG-LIVED LIKE HIS FATHER AND REACHED THE RIPE OLD AGE OF 102 LEAVING HIS SON SAMUEL CHARGED WITH THE CARE OF THE FAMILY DESTINIES BUT WITH NO GREAT BURDEN OF WEALTH

UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER FOR THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF EDISON'S ELABORATE PLANS HE HAD NOT BEEN MANY YEARS ESTABLISHED IN THE LABORATORY BEFORE A TROLLEY ROAD THROUGH WEST ORANGE WAS PROJECTED AND BUILT THE LINE PASSING IN FRONT OF THE PLANT AND WITHIN SEVENTY-FIVE FEET OF THE GALVANOMETER-ROOM THUS MAKING IT PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO USE IT FOR THE DELICATE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED

SO EACH OF US INCLUDING EDISON TOOK TURNS REVOLVING THE LATHE BY PULLING ON THE BELT WHILE THE OTHER TWO ATTENDED TO THE WINDING OF THE WIRE
IN MY OFFICIAL POSITION AS PRESIDENT OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY I BECAME THE TARGET ALONG WITH MR EDISON FOR CENSURE FROM THE STOCKHOLDERS AND OTHERS ON ACCOUNT OF THIS DELAY AND I WELL REMEMBER HOW DEEP THE FEELING WAS
HERE THE MATERIAL WAS AUTOMATICALLY DELIVERED TO THE GIANT ROLLS
I HAD USED AMMONIA AND BROMINE
WITHIN A MONTH HE HAD PROCURED TWO HUNDRED SUBSCRIBERS AND THE COMPANY WAS A SUCCESS
ONE OF THESE DERELICTS WAS A GREAT SOURCE OF WORRY TO ME PERSONALLY
THROUGH THEIR LABORS THE OLD STORY IS REITERATED IN THE CONTESTING OF APPROXIMATE BUT CONFLICTING CLAIMS THE NEVER-ENDING EFFORT TO SUPPRESS INFRINGEMENT AND THE DESTRUCTION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE OF THE COMMERCIAL PIRATES WHO SET SAIL UPON THE SEAS OF ALL SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISES
A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THIS REMARKABLE MACHINE WILL PROBABLY INTEREST THE READER
THE TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING DRUMS ARE RESPECTIVELY CONNECTED TO EARTH
HENCE THE ORDER WAS GIVEN TO BUILD THE NEW PACKING-HOUSE ON LINES SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE OLD ONE
INDEED THEY ARE DESCRIBED AND ILLUSTRATED IN EDISON'S FUNDAMENTAL LAMP PATENT NO
IN LIKE MANNER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EDISON LIGHTING SYSTEM FOLLOWED SEVERAL CONCURRENT SIMULTANEOUS LINES OF ADVANCE
AS ALREADY SEEN HE CAME EARLY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ONLY SOLUTION LAY IN THE USE OF A LAMP OF HIGH RESISTANCE AND SMALL RADIATING SURFACE AND WITH CHARACTERISTIC FERVOR AND ENERGY HE ATTACKED THE PROBLEM FROM THIS STANDPOINT HAVING ABSOLUTE FAITH IN A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME
AS THE MOVING PART REVOLVES THEREFORE CURRENTS OF ELECTRICITY ARE SET UP IN THE WIRES OF THE ARMATURES AND ARE COLLECTED BY A COMMUTATOR AS IN AN ORDINARY DYNAMO PLACED ON THE UPPER END OF THE CENTRAL SHAFT
AND THE ALERT INFRINGER GREW STRONG IN COURAGE AND CAPITAL
SOME OF THE STORIES WERE TOLD FOR THIS VOLUME
ABOUT 1 O'CLOCK THE OPERATOR AT THE INDIANAPOLIS OFFICE GOT HOLD OF AN OPERATOR ON A WIRE WHICH RAN FROM INDIANAPOLIS TO LOUISVILLE ALONG THE RAILROAD WHO HAPPENED TO COME INTO HIS OFFICE
A VISITOR TO THE LABORATORY WITH ONE OF THESE MEDALLIC AWARDS ASKED EDISON IF HE HAD ANY OTHERS
EDISON WAS INCLINED TO CONCUR IN THE PREVAILING OPINION AS TO THE EASY DESTRUCTIBILITY OF CARBON BUT WITHOUT ACTUALLY SETTLING THE POINT IN HIS MIND HE LAID ASIDE TEMPORARILY THIS LINE OF EXPERIMENT AND ENTERED A NEW FIELD
I HAD TWO MEN WORKING FOR ME--ONE A GERMAN THE OTHER A JEW
THIS SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE PRINCIPLE WAS THE ONE EMPLOYED BY EDISON IN HIS GREAT CONCENTRATING PLANT ALREADY DESCRIBED
THE SPARK WAS NOW TESTED IN DARK BOX AND FOUND TO BE VERY STRONG
SOME DINNERS HE HAD TO ATTEND BUT A MAN WHO ATE LITTLE AND HEARD LESS COULD DERIVE PRACTICALLY NO PLEASURE FROM THEM
I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A CIGAR
THE CARBOY TIPPED OVER THE ACID RAN OUT WENT THROUGH TO THE MANAGER'S ROOM BELOW AND ATE UP HIS DESK AND ALL THE CARPET
THIS LATTER AND THE METAL PLATE ARE CONNECTED IN AN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT WHICH INCLUDES A BATTERY AND A SENSITIVE GALVANOMETER
THEY WERE ALL SICK
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING EDISON IS EASY TOLERANCE ITSELF WITH A PECULIAR WEAKNESS TOWARD THOSE WHO HAVE THE LEAST RIGHT TO MAKE ANY DEMANDS ON HIS TIME
A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC-LIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISES FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR STREET LIGHTING
EDISON SAYS OF THIS PERIOD
SEVERAL OF US EXPRESSED OUR BELIEF THAT A PRINCE WASN'T MUCH AFTER ALL AND SAID THAT WE WERE THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED
ACCORDING TO MR FRANCIS JEHL OF BUDAPEST THEN ONE OF THE STAFF TO WHOM THE WRITERS ARE INDEBTED FOR A GREAT DEAL OF VALUABLE DATA ON THIS PERIOD
THE FOLLOWING FIGURES ARE BASED UPON THE SPECIAL REPORTS OF THE CENSUS BUREAU 1902 AND 1907 WITH ADDITIONS COMPUTED UPON THE INCREASE THAT HAS SUBSEQUENTLY TAKEN PLACE
HE OPENED IT AND WAS NEARLY OVERCOME

THIS LAMP TO MY MIND ENVELOPS WITH A CLOUD OF DISTRUST THE WHOLE GOEBEL STORY
THE ORDINARY ROUTINE OF DAILY FAMILY LIFE IS OF COURSE OFTEN INTERRUPTED BY RECEPTIONS AND PARTIES VISITS TO THE BILLIARD-ROOM THE ENTERTAINMENT OF VISITORS THE DEPARTURE TO AND RETURN FROM COLLEGE AT VACATION PERIODS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND MATTERS RELATING TO THE MANY SOCIAL AND PHILANTHROPIC CAUSES IN WHICH MRS EDISON IS ACTIVELY INTERESTED
CONCLUDING WITH THE REMARK THAT IT WAS NOW TIME TO ENGAGE ENGINEERS TO LAY OUT THE PLANT
SAID SIR WILLIAM
IT WAS FOUND HOWEVER IN THEIR EXPERIMENTS THAT THE CONTRARY EFFECT WAS PRODUCED FOR WITH EVERY ADDITIONAL LAMP INTRODUCED IN THE CIRCUIT THE TOTAL CANDLE-POWER DECREASED INSTEAD OF INCREASING
SHE WAS A TERRIFIC RUBBERNECK SHE JUMPED ALL OVER THE MACHINERY AND I HAD ONE MAN ESPECIALLY TO GUARD HER DRESS
REIS HIMSELF DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED IN THE MARVELLOUS POSSIBILITIES OF THE IDEA TO FOLLOW IT UP--REMARKING TO THE MAN WHO BOUGHT HIS TELEPHONIC INSTRUMENTS AND TOOLS THAT HE HAD SHOWN THE WORLD THE WAY

SO FAR AS IS KNOWN BOURSEUL WAS NOT PRACTICAL ENOUGH TO TRY HIS OWN SUGGESTION AND NEVER MADE A TELEPHONE
THE VOYAGE WAS ROUGH AND THE LITTLE JAVA JUSTIFIED HER REPUTATION BY JUMPING ALL OVER THE OCEAN
CHAPTER XV INTRODUCTION OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER ON THE INVENTION OF A SYSTEM THE NARRATIVE HAS BEEN CARRIED ALONG FOR SEVERAL YEARS OF ACTIVITY UP TO THE VERGE OF THE SUCCESSFUL AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATION OF EDISON'S IDEAS AND DEVICES FOR INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTING
THE ABOVE EXPERIMENT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR O'CLOCK ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND WITHIN A FEW HOURS HE HAD GATHERED HIS SUPERINTENDENT AND MEN OF THE MACHINE-WORKS AND HAD THEM AT WORK ON A SHAFTING DEVICE THAT HE THOUGHT WOULD REMEDY THE TROUBLE
HIS EXECUTIVE ABILITY WAS GREATER THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER MAN I HAVE YET SEEN
HIS BRAIN IS HIGHLY ORGANIZED
IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN HOW TO VULCANIZE RUBBER AND HOW TO GALVANIZE IRON
AND SECOND TO FEED CURRENT AT A CONSTANT POTENTIAL TO CENTRAL POINTS IN SUCH MAIN CONDUCTORS BY MEANS OF OTHER CONDUCTORS CALLED FEEDERS WHICH WERE TO BE CONNECTED DIRECTLY WITH THE SOURCE OF ENERGY AT THE CENTRAL STATION
HE WAS TOLD IT WAS DONE AT NIGHT BY THE JANITOR WHO WAS SENT FOR AND UPON BEING INTERROGATED AS TO WHAT LIGHT HE USED SAID THAT HE TURNED ON A CENTRAL FIXTURE CONTAINING ABOUT TEN LIGHTS
FOR MANY YEARS GOERCK STREET PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN EDISON'S AFFAIRS BEING THE CENTRE OF ALL HIS MANUFACTURE OF HEAVY MACHINERY
THE NEXT MAN ADJACENT WAS JOHN KRUESI AFTERWARD ENGINEER OF THE GREAT GENERAL ELECTRIC WORKS AT SCHENECTADY
A STRIP OF HARD RUBBER WITH POINTED ENDS RESTS PERPENDICULARLY ON A PLATINUM PLATE BENEATH WHICH IS A CARBON BUTTON UNDER WHICH AGAIN LIES ANOTHER PLATINUM PLATE
THE DEVICE SHOWN MADE BY EDISON IN 1875 WAS ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN A CAVEAT FILED JANUARY 14 1876 A MONTH BEFORE BELL OR GRAY
FURTHERMORE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SCIENTIFIC DISPUTES SHOULD BE DECIDED BY SOME COURT CONTAINING AT LEAST ONE OR TWO SCIENTIFIC MEN--MEN CAPABLE OF COMPREHENDING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF AN INVENTION AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT--IF JUSTICE IS EVER TO BE GIVEN TO AN INVENTOR
I HAD MY LABORATORY AT THE TOP OF THE BERGMANN WORKS AFTER MOVING FROM MENLO PARK
CHAPTER XXVI EDISON IN COMMERCE AND MANUFACTURE AN APPLICANT FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE ENGINEERS CLUB OF PHILADELPHIA IS REQUIRED TO GIVE A BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE PROFESSIONAL WORK HE HAS DONE
IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT BY MANY THAT THE MAGNIFICENT SUCCESS OF THIS PLANT DID MORE TO STIMULATE THE GROWTH OF THE INCANDESCENT LIGHTING BUSINESS THAN ANY OTHER EVENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE EDISON COMPANY
I THEN ADVANCED TO WITHIN TEN FEET AND SHOT AGAIN--THE RABBIT WAS STILL IMMOVABLE
HENCE IT WILL BE OBVIOUS THAT THESE TOYS PRODUCED MERELY AN ILLUSION OF THEORETICAL MOTION
APPARENTLY LITTLE OR NO LIGHTING SERVICE WAS OBTAINED FROM THE WALLACE-FARMER ARC LAMPS SECURED FROM ANSONIA CONNECTICUT
A VISIT TO THIS PART OF THE PLANT REVEALS AN AMAZING FERTILITY OF RESOURCEFULNESS AND INGENUITY IN THE DEVISING OF THE SPECIAL MACHINES AND APPLIANCES EMPLOYED IN CONSTRUCTING THE MECHANICAL PARTS OF THESE CELLS FOR IT IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FASHION THEM BY MEANS OF MACHINERY AND TOOLS TO BE FOUND IN THE OPEN MARKET NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMMENSE VARIETY THAT MAY BE THERE OBTAINED
SOLUTIONS OF POTASSIUM IODIDE WERE FREQUENTLY USED FOR THIS PURPOSE GIVING A SHARP BLUE RECORD BUT FADING AWAY TOO RAPIDLY
IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND SAID
I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY PHILADELPHIA BUT PERHAPS THIS FURTHER STORY IS A BETTER INDICATION OF DEVELOPED HUMOR AND SHREWDNESS
THERE WAS AN AVERAGE COST PER LAMP FOR METER OPERATION OF TWENTY-TWO CENTS A YEAR AND EACH METER TOOK CARE OF AN AVERAGE OF SEVENTEEN LAMPS
HE FINALLY THOUGHT THAT A GOOD STORAGE BATTERY WAS A GREAT REQUISITE AND DECIDED TO TRY AND DEVISE A NEW TYPE FOR HE DECLARED EMPHATICALLY HE WOULD MAKE NO BATTERY REQUIRING SULPHURIC ACID
FOR THIS PURPOSE TWENTY-TWO HUNDRED MILES OF BRAZILIAN CABLE THEN STORED UNDER WATER IN TANKS AT THE GREENWICH WORKS OF THE TELEGRAPH CONSTRUCTION MAINTENANCE COMPANY NEAR LONDON WAS PLACED AT HIS DISPOSAL FROM 8 P.M
IN THE EQUIPMENTS OWNED BY SUCH COMPANIES THERE ARE INCLUDED 68,636 ELECTRIC CARS AND 17,568 TRAILERS AND OTHERS MAKING A TOTAL OF 86,204 OF SUCH VEHICLES

WHAT TO DO WITH A HOST OF OTHERS IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO DECIDE EVEN WHEN WRITTEN BY CRANKS WHO IMAGINE THEMSELVES SUBJECT TO STRANGE ELECTRICAL AILMENTS FROM WHICH EDISON ALONE CAN RELIEVE THEM

I STARTED FOR IT ON FOOT

THE GENERAL DID SO AND IN ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS HE SAID
THEY WERE DIAMONDS FOR EXHIBITION PURPOSES PROBABLY GLASS THIS DID NOT ALTOGETHER COMPLETE THE EUROPEAN TRIP OF 1889 FOR EDISON WISHED TO SEE HELMHOLTZ
WHILE MR EDISON AND HIS ASSOCIATES WERE WORKING ON THE PROBLEM OF CHEAP CONCENTRATION OF IRON ORE AN ADDED DIFFICULTY FACED THEM IN THE PREPARATION OF THE CONCENTRATES FOR THE MARKET

HE ALSO ADDED A MINOR IMPROVEMENT HERE AND THERE AND NOW WE HAVE A FINER BATTERY THAN WE EVER EXPECTED IN THE INTERIM WHILE THE EXPERIMENTATION OF THESE LAST FIVE YEARS WAS IN PROGRESS MANY CUSTOMERS WHO HAD PURCHASED BATTERIES OF THE ORIGINAL TYPE CAME KNOCKING AT THE DOOR WITH ORDERS IN THEIR HANDS FOR ADDITIONAL OUTFITS WHEREWITH TO EQUIP MORE WAGONS AND TRUCKS
SIMILAR EFFECTS WOULD BE PRODUCED FROM B TO A IF THE BATTERY AND KEY WERE PLACED AT THE B END
IF I HADN'T SOLD ANY OF MINE WHAT WOULD IT BE WORTH TO-DAY AND AFTER SOME FIGURING I REPLIED
BUT IN THIS RESPECT HE IS SINGULARLY FREE AND HIS SPELLS OF ANGER ARE REALLY FEW
HARD WORK NOTHING TO DIVERT MY THOUGHT CLEAR AIR AND SIMPLE FOOD MADE MY LIFE VERY PLEASANT
HERE AGAIN EDISON BEGAN TO INVENT AND IMPROVE ON EXISTING APPARATUS WITH THE RESULT OF HAVING ONCE MORE TO MOVE ON THE STORY MAY BE TOLD IN HIS OWN TERSE LANGUAGE
THESE CAVEATS SERVED THEIR PURPOSE THOROUGHLY IN MANY INSTANCES BUT THERE HAVE REMAINED A GREAT VARIETY OF PROJECTS UPON WHICH NO DEFINITE ACTION WAS EVER TAKEN
I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING UNREAL ABOUT IT
FROM BEING A NEW-COMER IN THE CEMENT BUSINESS HIS CORPORATION IN FIVE YEARS HAS GROWN TO BE THE FIFTH LARGEST PRODUCER IN THE UNITED STATES WITH A STILL INCREASING CAPACITY
THEN THE CALLER NO MATTER HOW IMPORTANT OR WHAT HIS MISSION IS LIKELY TO REALIZE HIS UTTER INSIGNIFICANCE AND BE SENT AWAY WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHING HIS OBJECT
PUSHING EACH OTHER TO GET INTO THESE NARROW QUARTERS YELLING OUT THE PRICES AT THE DOOR AND PUSHING BACK FOR LATER ONES THE HUSTLE MADE THIS DOORWAY TO ME A MOST UNDESIRABLE REFUGE FROM AN APRIL SHOWER

HE FOUND THEM ALL GREATLY LACKING IN ECONOMY OF OPERATION
A THERMOSTATIC MOTOR
HOWEVER I GOT AROUND THE DIFFICULTY BY PUTTING A LITTLE BOTTLE OF CHLOROFORM IN EACH BOX CORKED UP WITH A SLIGHT HOLE IN THE CORK
BUT WHILE EDISON'S ORIGINAL BROAD IDEAS ARE EMBODIED IN PRESENT PRACTICE THE PERFECTION OF THE MODERN ELECTRIC RAILWAY IS GREATLY DUE TO THE LABORS AND INVENTIONS OF A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER WELL-KNOWN INVENTORS
ONE CAN WATCH THE DANCING LITTLE FLAMES OF KOENIG AND SEE A VOICE EXPRESSED IN TONGUES OF FIRE

A COLUMN CAME OUT IN THE MORNING ABOUT IT
IT PROVED TO BE A DYNAMO WHICH I FINALLY SUCCEEDED IN ASSEMBLING AND RUNNING
OUR EXPLANATION HAS MERELY AIMED TO SHOW THE UNDERLYING PHENOMENA AND PRINCIPLES IN BROAD OUTLINE WITHOUT ENTERING INTO MORE DETAIL THAN WAS DEEMED ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
JENKS MADE A COMPARATIVE CALCULATION WHICH SHOWED THAT SUCH A SYSTEM OF CONDUCTORS KNOWN AS THE TREE SYSTEM TO SUPPLY 8640 LAMPS IN A TERRITORY EXTENDING OVER SO SMALL AN AREA AS NINE CITY BLOCKS WOULD REQUIRE 803,250 POUNDS OF COPPER WHICH AT THE THEN PRICE OF 25 CENTS PER POUND WOULD COST $200,812.50
I AM GRIEVED TO OBSERVE THAT MANY PERSONS WHO TALK AND WRITE GLIBLY ABOUT ELECTRICITY DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT
EDISON TELLS OF HIS FREQUENT VISITS TO THE SHOPS AT NIGHT WITH THE ESCORT OF JIM RUSSELL A WELL-KNOWN DETECTIVE WHO KNEW ALL THE DENIZENS OF THE PLACE

THERE WAS ABOUT $10,000 WORTH OF MACHINERY
IMPROVED FACTORY FACILITIES WERE INTRODUCED
HIS CONCEIT WAS SO ENORMOUS LIFE WAS MADE A BURDEN TO HIM BY ALL THE BOYS AROUND THE LABORATORY
MR EDISON WAS CONSULTING ELECTRICIAN FOR THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY COMPANY BUT NEITHER A DIRECTOR NOR AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER
IF THE ANGULAR MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT ACROSS THE FIELD IS VERY SLOW AS FOR INSTANCE A DISTANT VESSEL THE SUCCESSIVE POSITIONS OF THE OBJECT ARE SO NEARLY COINCIDENT THAT WHEN REPRODUCED BEFORE THE EYE AN IMPRESSION OF SMOOTH CONTINUOUS MOVEMENT IS SECURED

AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I CAN ANY TIME GET A JOB AT $75 PER MONTH AS A TELEGRAPHER AND THAT WILL AMPLY TAKE CARE OF ALL MY PERSONAL REQUIREMENTS AS ALREADY STATED HOWEVER HE STARTED IN WITH THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ENTHUSIASM AND AMBITION AND IN THE COURSE OF ABOUT THREE YEARS WE SUCCEEDED IN PAYING OFF ALL THE INDEBTEDNESS OF THE CONCENTRATING WORKS WHICH AMOUNTED TO SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

IT WAS A CURIOUS EXAMPLE OF ESTABLISHING STANDARD PRACTICE WHILE CHANGING WITH KALEIDOSCOPIC RAPIDITY ALL THE ELEMENTS INVOLVED
MY FRIEND PROFESSOR VON REISENBERG OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GHENT PURSUED A SERIES OF INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CAPACITY OF VARIOUS ANIMALS TO RECEIVE IDEAS
THE EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO AVOID TECHNIQUE AND ABSTRUSE PHRASES BUT SOME DEGREE OF EXPLANATION HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN REGARD TO EACH GROUP OF INVENTIONS
BEGINNING ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO WITH A BATTERY THAT WITHOUT POLARIZING WOULD FURNISH LARGE CURRENTS SPECIALLY ADAPTED FOR GAS-ENGINE IGNITION AND OTHER IMPORTANT PURPOSES THE BUSINESS HAS STEADILY GROWN IN MAGNITUDE UNTIL THE PRESENT OUTPUT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT 125,000 CELLS ANNUALLY
MANY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS OF A MINOR AND MECHANICAL NATURE BUT WHICH WERE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN HIS SOLUTION OF THIS DIFFICULT PROBLEM ARE WORTHY OF STUDY BY THOSE INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH OR INTERESTED IN THE ART
THESE WERE THE PROTOTYPES OF THE LIGHTED BUOYS WHICH HAVE SINCE BECOME FAMILIAR AS IN THE CHANNEL OFF SANDY HOOK
THERE WAS NO LACK OF BUYERS BUT ON THE CONTRARY THE FACTORY WAS UNABLE TO TURN OUT BATTERIES ENOUGH
THAT IS TO SAY EVERY CELL OF BATTERY OF ANY KIND CONTAINS AT LEAST TWO ELEMENTS OF DIFFERENT NATURE IMMERSED IN A MORE OR LESS LIQUID ELECTROLYTE OF CHEMICAL CHARACTER

SO THIN ARE THE LAYERS THAT THIS SHEET IS ONLY ABOUT THE THICKNESS OF A VISITING-CARD AND YET IT IS COMPOSED OF TWO HUNDRED LAYERS OF METAL
MR EDISON WAS A LITTLE DISTURBED BUT INSISTED THAT THERE WAS A MISTAKE SOMEWHERE
EDISON WAS THE FIRST TO MAKE APPARATUS IN WHICH CARBON WAS USED AS ONE OF THE ELECTRODES
ANOTHER QUOTATION FROM MAJOR EATON IS OF INTEREST IN THIS CONNECTION
THE READER WILL QUITE READILY UNDERSTAND THEREFORE THAT A MULTIPLE-ARC SYSTEM IS THE ONLY ONE PRACTICALLY COMMERCIAL WHERE ELECTRIC LIGHT IS TO BE USED IN SMALL UNITS LIKE THOSE OF GAS OR OIL
A LARGE SHOP WAS RENTED IN NEWARK EQUIPPED WITH $25,000 WORTH OF MACHINERY AND EDISON WAS GIVEN FULL CHARGE

AND THE UTILIZATION OF THE DEVICE FOR THE TEACHING OF LANGUAGES FOR WHICH PURPOSE IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED FOR EXAMPLE BY THE INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOLS OF SCRANTON PENNSYLVANIA FOR SEVERAL YEARS
MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE LEGAL FRATERNITY IS THAT SCIENTIFIC SUBJECTS ARE DISTASTEFUL TO THEM AND IT IS RARE IN THIS COUNTRY ON ACCOUNT OF THE SYSTEM OF TRYING PATENT SUITS FOR A JUDGE REALLY TO REACH THE MEAT OF THE CONTROVERSY AND INVENTORS SCARCELY EVER GET A DECISION SQUARELY AND ENTIRELY IN THEIR FAVOR

HE BUILT A FIRE IN A BARN BUT THE FLAMES SPREAD SO RAPIDLY THAT ALTHOUGH HE ESCAPED HIMSELF THE BARN WAS WHOLLY DESTROYED AND HE WAS PUBLICLY WHIPPED IN THE VILLAGE SQUARE AS A WARNING TO OTHER YOUTHS
CHAPTER XVIII THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY EDISON HAD NO SOONER DESIGNED HIS DYNAMO IN 1879 THAN HE ADOPTED THE SAME FORM OF MACHINE FOR USE AS A MOTOR
MALLORY ONE OF HIS CLOSEST ASSOCIATES FOR MANY YEARS IS THE AUTHORITY FOR THE FOLLOWING
BUT EDISON'S WORK ON THE AUTOMATIC DID NOT STOP WITH THIS BASIC SUGGESTION FOR HE TOOK UP AND PERFECTED THE MECHANICAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE INSTRUMENTS AS WELL AS THE PERFORATORS AND ALSO SUGGESTED NUMEROUS ELECTROSENSITIVE CHEMICALS FOR THE RECEIVERS SO THAT THE AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH ALMOST ENTIRELY BY REASON OF HIS INDIVIDUAL WORK WAS PLACED ON A PLANE OF COMMERCIAL PRACTICABILITY
I BUILT ONE OF THESE MACHINES AND RAN IT SUCCESSFULLY IN OUR EARLY DAYS AT THE GOERCK STREET SHOP
THE FIRST EDISON PLANT IN A HOTEL WAS STARTED IN OCTOBER 1881 AT THE BLUE MOUNTAIN HOUSE IN THE ADIRONDACKS AND CONSISTED OF TWO Z DYNAMOS WITH A COMPLEMENT OF EIGHT AND SIXTEEN CANDLE LAMPS
FOR EXAMPLE THE EARLY FILAMENT MADE OF A MIXTURE OF LAMPBLACK AND TAR IS MERELY A SUGGESTION IN THE NOTES BUT ITS MAKING AFFORDED AN EXAMPLE OF EDISON'S PERTINACITY
AFTER A WHILE WE GOT THE ENGINES AND BOILERS AND WIRES ALL DONE AND THE LIGHTS IN POSITION BEFORE THE HOUSE WAS QUITE FINISHED AND THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE AN EXHIBIT OF THE LIGHT
A FEW WEEKS AFTERWARD I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM ONE OF MY LONDON FRIENDS WHO WAS A DOUBTING THOMAS UPBRAIDING ME FOR COMING SO SOON UNDER THE SPELL OF THE YANKEE INVENTOR IT WAS TO CONFRONT AND DEAL WITH JUST THIS ELEMENT OF DOUBT IN LONDON AND IN EUROPE GENERALLY THAT THE DISPATCH OF JOHNSON TO ENGLAND AND OF BATCHELOR TO FRANCE WAS INTENDED
AND HIS VIEWS WERE EXPRESSED IN VERY FEW WORDS BUT IN A CHARACTERISTIC AND EMPHATIC MANNER
THE LAYING OF OVER SIX MILES OF STREET MAINS IN NEW YORK
WHY DID NOT HIS SON TAKE THIS LAMP TO MR EATON'S OFFICE IN 1882 WHEN HE TRIED TO NEGOTIATE THE SALE OF HIS FATHER'S INVENTIONS TO THE EDISON COMPANY
AND SECOND ITS NATURE MUST BE SUCH THAT VERY LITTLE WOULD BE NECESSARY PER TON OF CONCENTRATES
12,037 UNDER DATE OF SEPTEMBER 30,1902 AND NO
THE TWO ARE SHOWN IN THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN OF OCTOBER 18 1879 AND ARE ALIKE EXCEPT THAT THE DYNAMO IS VERTICAL AND THE MOTOR LIES IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION THE ARTICLE REMARKING
THERE WAS A DAY WHEN THE ART OFFERED A DISTINCT CAREER TO ALL OF ITS PRACTITIONERS AND YOUNG MEN OF AMBITION AND GOOD FAMILY WERE EAGER TO BEGIN EVEN AS MESSENGER BOYS AND WERE READY TO UNDERGO A SEVERE ORDEAL OF APPRENTICESHIP WITH THE BELIEF THAT THEY COULD ULTIMATELY ATTAIN POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND PROFIT
WATT CORLISS AND PORTER BROUGHT FORWARD STEAM-ENGINES TO A HIGH STATE OF PROFICIENCY YET IT REMAINED FOR MR EDISON TO FORCE BETTER PROPORTIONS WORKMANSHIP DESIGNS USE OF METALS REGULATION THE SOLVING OF THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS OF HIGH SPEED AND ENDURANCE AND THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SHAFT GOVERNOR
ALTHOUGH VERY MANY OF THESE INVENTIONS WERE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND VALUE WE CANNOT ATTEMPT TO OFFER A DETAILED EXPOSITION OF THEM IN THIS NECESSARILY BRIEF ARTICLE BUT MUST REFER THE READER IF INTERESTED TO THE PATENTS THEMSELVES A FULL LIST BEING GIVEN AT THE END OF THIS APPENDIX
THE STATISTICS OF 1908 FOR AMERICAN STREET AND ELEVATED RAILWAYS SHOW THAT WITHIN TWENTY-FIVE YEARS THE ELECTRIC-RAILWAY INDUSTRY HAS GROWN TO EMBRACE 38,812 MILES OF TRACK ON STREETS AND FOR ELEVATED RAILWAYS OPERATED UNDER THE OWNERSHIP OF 1238 SEPARATE COMPANIES WHOSE TOTAL CAPITALIZATION AMOUNTED TO THE ENORMOUS SUM OF $4,123,834,598
RAILWAYS WERE GROWING AT THE RATE OF NEARLY ONE THOUSAND MILES ANNUALLY
THE WEATHER BEING COLD AND BEING CLOTHED POORLY MY PECULIAR APPEARANCE CAUSED MUCH MIRTH AND AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED THE NIGHT OPERATORS HAD CONSULTED TOGETHER HOW THEY MIGHT PUT UP A JOB ON THE JAY FROM THE WOOLLY WEST I WAS GIVEN A PEN AND ASSIGNED TO THE NEW YORK NO
IF THERE ARE NO FACTORIES HE SAID TO MAKE MY INVENTIONS I WILL BUILD THE FACTORIES MYSELF
IN TWO DISTINCT DIRECTIONS THE GAS ART WAS IMMEDIATELY HELPED BY EDISON'S WORK
AS THE MATTER WAS RECEIVED OVER THE WIRE HE PARAGRAPHED IT SO THAT EACH PRINTER HAD EXACTLY THREE LINES THUS ENABLING THE MATTER TO BE SET UP VERY EXPEDITIOUSLY IN THE NEWSPAPER OFFICES
ONE OF THESE WORKERS RELATING THE STRENUOUS EXPERIENCES OF THESE FEW YEARS SAYS
HE TAKES EXTREMELY LITTLE EXERCISE ALTHOUGH HIS GOOD COLOR AND QUICKNESS OF STEP WOULD SUGGEST TO THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW BETTER THAT HE IS IN THE BEST OF TRAINING AND ONE WHO LIVES IN THE OPEN AIR
REALIZING THAT TO NEW YORK HE MUST LOOK FOR FURTHER SUPPORT IN HIS EFFORTS EDISON DEEP IN DEBT FOR HIS EMBRYONIC INVENTIONS BUT WITH HIGH HOPE AND COURAGE NOW MADE THE NEXT MOMENTOUS STEP IN HIS CAREER
BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT AT THE PERIOD OF WHICH WE WRITE EDISON HIMSELF STILL UNDER THIRTY-FIVE WAS THE CENTRE OF AN EXTRAORDINARY GROUP OF MEN FULL OF EFFERVESCING AND ASPIRING TALENT TO WHICH HE GAVE GLORIOUS OPPORTUNITY
26 1886 490,954 MANUFACTURE OF CARBON FILAMENTS FOR ELECTRIC LAMPS NOV
IT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO THE READER TO NOTE SOME PARTS OF THE GLOBE TO WHICH SHIPMENTS OF PHONOGRAPHS AND RECORDS ARE MADE
IT MUST BE WATERPROOF TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BECAUSE CONSIDERATIONS CONNECTED WITH SECURING LOW RATES OF FREIGHT MAKE IT NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO SHIP THE CONCENTRATES TO MARKET IN OPEN COAL CARS EXPOSED TO SNOW AND RAIN
THIS APPARENTLY REMOTE CONSIDERATION WEIGHT OF COPPER USED--WAS REALLY THE COMMERCIAL KEY TO THE PROBLEM JUST AS THE INCANDESCENT BURNER WAS THE SCIENTIFIC KEY TO THAT PROBLEM
YES PAIRFECKLY SAFE FORTUNATELY NO OTHER HURTS WERE SUFFERED AND IN A FEW MINUTES WE HAD THE TRAIN ON THE TRACK AND RUNNING AGAIN ALL THIS ROUGH-AND-READY DEALING WITH GRADES AND CURVES WAS NOT MERE HORSE-PLAY BUT HAD A SERIOUS PURPOSE UNDERLYING IT EVERY TRIP HAVING ITS RECORD AS TO SOME FEATURE OF DEFECT OR IMPROVEMENT
493,426 ISSUED MARCH 14 1893
THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST MONTH'S TEST SHOWED AN APPARENT OVERCHARGE BY THE EDISON COMPANY
THE GOEBEL CASE EMPHASIZES TWO DEFECTS IN THE COURT PROCEDURE IN PATENT CASES
THE INTERIOR WINDING OF THE SUNBURY STATION INCLUDING THE RUNNING OF TWO THREE-WIRE FEEDERS THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE BUILDING FROM BACK TO FRONT THE WIRING UP OF THE DYNAMOS AND SWITCHBOARD AND ALL INSTRUMENTS TOGETHER WITH BUS-BARS ETC.--IN FACT ALL LABOR AND MATERIAL USED IN THE ELECTRICAL WIRING INSTALLATION--AMOUNTED TO THE SUM OF $90
NAMELY THE ATTEMPT OF THE MANY TO PERFECT AND REFINE AND EVEN RE-INVENT WHERE ONE OR TWO DARING SPIRITS HAVE LED THE WAY
THIS SEARCHING METHOD IS FOLLOWED NOT ONLY IN CHEMICAL OR OTHER INVESTIGATIONS INTO WHICH COMPLEXITIES MIGHT NATURALLY ENTER BUT ALSO IN MORE MECHANICAL QUESTIONS WHERE SIMPLICITY OF CONSTRUCTION MIGHT NATURALLY SEEM TO PRECLUDE POSSIBILITIES OF UNCERTAINTY
IT WAS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST THINGS I EVER WITNESSED TO SEE HIM CRAWL INTO AN ORDINARY ROLL-TOP DESK AND CURL UP AND TAKE A NAP
NEITHER OF THESE MEN WAS SQUELCHED BY SUCH A CALAMITOUS RESULT BUT IF THERE WERE NOT SOMETHING OF BITTERNESS IN THEIR FEELINGS AS THEY SURVEY WHAT HAS COME OF THEIR WORK THEY WOULD NOT BE HUMAN
A MAN BY THE NAME OF EPSTEIN HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF BUYING BRASS CHIPS AND TRIMMINGS FROM THE LATHES AND IN SOME WAY BERGMANN FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN CHEATED
HENCE THE AVAILABILITY OF A TELEGRAPH LINE AS THUS OPERATED IS LIMITED TO THIS CAPACITY EXCEPT AS IT MAY BE MULTIPLIED BY TWO WITH THE USE OF THE DUPLEX OR BY FOUR WITH THE QUADRUPLEX
THE TASIMETER HAS BEEN USED TO DEMONSTRATE HEAT FROM REMOTE STARS SUNS SUCH AS ARCTURUS
THIS METHOD OF GIVING NOTES FOR MY ACCOUNTS AND HAVING ALL NOTES PROTESTED I KEPT UP OVER TWO YEARS YET MY CREDIT WAS FINE
EXPERT OSBORN FOR DEFENDANT AFTER SETTING FORTH MINUTELY HIS SUPERIOR QUALIFICATIONS MECHANICAL EDUCATION AND GREAT EXPERIENCE TAKES UP IN DETAIL THE PATENT CLAIMS AND SHOWS TO HIS OWN ENTIRE SATISFACTION THAT NONE OF THEM ARE NEW
I GAVE THEM A GOOD TRAINING AS TO WORKING HOURS AND HUSTLING SAYS THEIR QUONDAM MASTER
THESE ARTS WERE INDEED TWINS FEEDING AT INEXHAUSTIBLE BREASTS
AT THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE ELECTRIC-LIGHTING ART IS THE ESSENTIALLY COMMERCIAL CONSIDERATION THAT ONE CANNOT SPEND VERY MUCH FOR CONDUCTORS AND EDISON DETERMINED THAT IN ORDER TO USE WIRES OF A PRACTICABLE SIZE THE VOLTAGE OF THE CURRENT I.E ITS PRESSURE OR THE CHARACTERISTIC THAT OVERCOMES RESISTANCE TO ITS FLOW SHOULD BE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN VOLTS WHICH SINCE ITS ADOPTION HAS BEEN THE STANDARD
MOREOVER JUST ABOUT THE TIME THAT EDISON TOOK UP INCANDESCENT LIGHTING WATER-GAS WAS BEING INTRODUCED ON A LARGE SCALE AS A COMMERCIAL ILLUMINANT THAT COULD BE PRODUCED AT A MUCH LOWER COST THAN COAL-GAS
LOOK OVER YOUR FILES SAID THE BOSS TO THE MAN HANDLING THE PRESS STUFF
WE TOLD HER WE HAD THE PLANT IN THE CELLAR AND WHEN SHE LEARNED WE HAD A BOILER THERE SHE SAID SHE WOULD NOT OCCUPY THE HOUSE
WHEN A HORSE WENT TO PASS OVER IT HE WOULD GET A VERY SEVERE SHOCK
THE LOCAL TRAIN FROM PORT HURON TO DETROIT A DISTANCE OF SIXTY-THREE MILES LEFT AT 7 A.M
THE OFFICE BOY HAD PUT THE INK IN A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WHEN THE OPERATOR HAD TURNED HIS HEAD DURING A LULL
NEITHER SOCKETS SWITCHES FUSES LAMP-HOLDERS NOR ANY OF THE OTHER ACCESSORIES NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION WERE WANTING
THE TWO LAST NAMED K AND L ARE SHOWN TO MAKE THE SKETCH COMPLETE BUT IN PRACTICE WOULD BE AT THE TRANSMITTING END WHICH MIGHT BE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY
THESE FEW ACRES ALONE CONTAINED SUFFICIENT ORE TO SUPPLY THE WHOLE UNITED STATES IRON TRADE INCLUDING EXPORTS FOR SEVENTY YEARS GIVEN A MOUNTAIN OF ROCK CONTAINING ONLY ONE-FIFTH TO ONE-FOURTH MAGNETIC IRON THE BROAD PROBLEM CONFRONTING EDISON RESOLVED ITSELF INTO THREE DISTINCT PARTS--FIRST TO TEAR DOWN THE MOUNTAIN BODILY AND GRIND IT TO POWDER
AS ONE IS ABOUT TO PASS OUT OF THE LIBRARY ATTENTION IS ARRESTED BY AN INCONGRUITY IN THE FORM OF A COT WHICH STANDS IN AN ALCOVE NEAR THE DOOR
AT THE TIME OF THIS WRITING THE RATE OF PRODUCTION IS OVER 8000 BARRELS OF CEMENT PER DAY OR SAY 2,500,000 BARRELS PER YEAR HAVING AN APPROXIMATE SELLING VALUE OF A LITTLE LESS THAN $2,000,000 WITH PROSPECTS OF INCREASING IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO A DAILY OUTPUT OF 10,000 BARRELS
IT HAPPENS HOWEVER THAT THE PROCESS HAS LEFT A VAST MASS OF DISCOVERY AND INVENTION WHOLLY UNTOUCHED AND RELEGATES TO A CONCLUDING BRIEF CHAPTER SOME OF THE MOST INTERESTING EPISODES OF A FRUITFUL LIFE
BUT IT WAS NOT IN A DESIRABLE NEIGHBORHOOD AND OWING TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE BUSINESS SOON BECAME DISADVANTAGEOUS FOR OTHER REASONS
THE MERIT WAS TOO OBVIOUS TO REMAIN UNRECOGNIZED
HE DID NOT CEASE THE PUBLICATION OF THE WEEKLY HERALD
FOR ALTHOUGH ALL HIS INVENTIONS HAVE BEEN EVOLVED THROUGH EXPERIMENT MANY OF HIS NOTABLE EXPERIMENTS HAVE CALLED FORTH THE EXERCISE OF HIGHLY INVENTIVE FACULTIES IN THEIR VERY INCEPTION
17 1882 271,614 SHAFTING OCT
HE RAN OVER EVERY ITEM OF THE TABULATIONS RAPIDLY AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY CALCULATION WHATEVER WOULD CHECK OFF ERRORS AS FAST AS HE CAME TO THEM SAYING
EDISON CONFESSES THAT HE HAS NEVER MADE A CENT OUT OF HIS PATENTS IN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER--IN FACT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN AN EXPENSE TO HIM AND THUS A FREE GIFT TO THE WORLD
ONE NIGHT HE BUILT A FIRE IN THE GRATE AND STARTED TO THROW PISTOL CARTRIDGES INTO THE FLAMES
13 1883 459,835 MANUFACTURE OF INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
THIS SHOP CONTAINED LIGHT AND HEAVY LATHES BORING AND DRILLING MACHINES ALL KINDS OF PLANING MACHINES
AND ANY SIGNALS GIVEN THROUGH THE MAGNETS WERE EMBOSSED ON THE DISK OF PAPER
HE HAD NOTED A GOOSE SITTING ON HER EGGS AND THE RESULT
IF THEREFORE LIKE INSTRUMENTS ARE PLACED AT EACH END OF THE LINE AS IN FIG
MOVING QUICKLY INTO A LARGER SHOP NOS
ACTING AS JUDGES INVENTORS WOULD NOT BE VERY APT TO CORRECTLY DECIDE A COMPLICATED LAW POINT

AT THE TIME OF EDISON'S INVENTION AS RELATED IN CHAPTER IX OF THE PRECEDING NARRATIVE THERE EXISTED NO OTHER KNOWN METHOD THAN THE ONE JUST DESCRIBED FOR THE REPETITION OF TRANSMITTED SIGNALS THUS LIMITING THE APPLICATION OF TELEGRAPHY TO THE PLEASURE OF THOSE WHO MIGHT OWN ANY PATENT CONTROLLING THE RELAY EXCEPT ON SIMPLE CIRCUITS WHERE A SINGLE BATTERY WAS SUFFICIENT
17 1883 287,522 MOLDS FOR CARBONIZING
THEY WERE NOT ONLY MORE SURLY
THEY WERE SO PLACED THAT WHEN A RAT PASSED OVER THEM THE FORE FEET ON THE ONE PLATE AND THE HIND FEET ON THE OTHER COMPLETED THE CIRCUIT AND THE RAT DEPARTED THIS LIFE ELECTROCUTED SHORTLY AFTER EDISON'S ARRIVAL AT CINCINNATI CAME THE CLOSE OF THE CIVIL WAR AND THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN
THE REPORTS STATED THAT THE MEXICANS HAD BEEN PANNING GOLD FOR A HUNDRED YEARS OUT OF THESE DEPOSITS
WAX BEING A NON-CONDUCTOR CANNOT BE ELECTROPLATED UNLESS A CONDUCTING SURFACE BE FIRST APPLIED
ANY ONE WITH A SHEET OF PAPER CAN ASCERTAIN THE YEARLY INTEREST ON THE INVESTMENT AS A FIXED CHARGE TO BE ASSESSED AGAINST EACH HOUSE ON THE BASIS THAT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FOUR HOUSES CAN BE BUILT IN A YEAR WITH THE BATTERY OF SIX SETS OF MOLDS
JUST AS BRUSH WORKED OUT HIS ARC-LIGHTING SYSTEM IN CLEVELAND

POSSIBILITY OF QUICK DISCONNECTION OR REPLACEMENT OF ANY CELL WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT OF SKILLED LABOR
THAT THE HEAVY PARTS OF THE MIXTURE COULD NOT BE HELD IN SUSPENSION BUT WOULD SEPARATE OUT BY GRAVITY AND MAKE AN UNEVENLY BALANCED STRUCTURE
THE RELAY AT A WOULD BE UNRESPONSIVE BUT THE CORE OF THE RELAY AT B WOULD BE MAGNETIZED AND ITS ARMATURE RESPOND TO SIGNALS FROM A
THE TOTAL COST BEING PERHAPS $2500 A YEAR
SO IN PRESENTING THE MASS OF STATISTICS CONTAINED IN THIS CHAPTER WE FEAR THAT THE RESULT MAY HAVE BEEN THE BEWILDERMENT OF THE READER TO SOME EXTENT
WHEREUPON I WAS VERY MUCH EMBARRASSED
HOWEVER WE DID SHOOT A NUMBER OF LIVE ONES UNTIL FOX RAN OUT OF CARTRIDGES
AS THE READER WILL OBTAIN A FULLER COMPREHENSION OF THIS IDEA AND OF EDISON'S METHODS BY CONCRETE ILLUSTRATION RATHER THAN BY GENERALIZATION THE AUTHORS HAVE THOUGHT IT WELL TO SELECT AT RANDOM TWO TYPICAL INSTANCES OF SPECIFIC INVESTIGATIONS OUT OF THE THOUSANDS THAT ARE SCATTERED THROUGH THE NOTEBOOKS
THE TELEPHONE WAS BEING DEVELOPED IN ENGLAND AND EDISON HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH COLONEL GOURAUD HIS OLD ASSOCIATE IN THE AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH TO REPRESENT HIS INTERESTS
IF THE OPERATOR PRESSES ONE OF THESE DOT KEYS IT IS ENGAGED BY AN APPROPRIATE PIN ON THE REVOLVING CYLINDER
FROM FIRST TO LAST EDISON HAS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE--IN ADDITION TO MORE THAN 1400 APPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS--SOME 120 CAVEATS EMBRACING NOT LESS THAN 1500 INVENTIONS
WE MUST LET EDISON TELL THE STORY OF SOME OF HIS EXPERIENCES
INDEED WITH THE AID OF THE RAILWAY TELEGRAPH EDISON WAS OFTEN ABLE TO PRINT LATE NEWS OF IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL ORIGIN THAT THE DISTANT REGULAR PAPERS LIKE THOSE OF DETROIT WHICH HE HANDLED AS A NEWSBOY COULD NOT GET
NO ORDERS EVER HAD TO BE GIVEN TO ESTABLISH THE TELEGRAPH CHAPTER VI WORK AND INVENTION IN BOSTON MILTON ADAMS WAS WORKING IN THE OFFICE OF THE FRANKLIN TELEGRAPH COMPANY IN BOSTON WHEN HE RECEIVED EDISON'S APPEAL FROM PORT HURON AND WITH CHARACTERISTIC IMPETUOSITY AT ONCE MADE IT HIS BUSINESS TO SECURE A POSITION FOR HIS FRIEND
IT WAS A PERIOD OF HIS LIFE CORRESPONDING TO THE WANDERJAHRE OF THE GERMAN ARTISAN AND WAS AN EASY WAY OF GRATIFYING A TASTE FOR TRAVEL WITHOUT THE RISK OF PRIVATION
AND THE MERE FACT THAT IN THIS SEARCH YEARS MIGHT BE TAKEN WOULD NOT LESSEN HIS ENTHUSIASM TO THE SLIGHTEST EXTENT
THAT HE WAS IN THIS INSTANCE A TRUE PIONEER AND CREATOR IS EVIDENT AS WE CONSIDER THE SUBJECT FOR THE UNITED STATES PATENT NO
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER SEEMS TO BE THAT MRS EDISON A TEACHER OF UNCOMMON ABILITY AND FORCE HELD NO VERY HIGH OPINION OF THE AVERAGE PUBLIC-SCHOOL METHODS AND RESULTS AND WAS BOTH EAGER TO UNDERTAKE THE INSTRUCTION OF HER SON AND AMBITIOUS FOR THE FUTURE OF A BOY WHOM SHE KNEW FROM PEDAGOGIC EXPERIENCE TO BE RECEPTIVE AND THOUGHTFUL TO A VERY UNUSUAL DEGREE
WHILE WORKING AT STRATFORD JUNCTION HE SAYS I WAS TOLD BY ONE OF THE FREIGHT CONDUCTORS THAT IN THE FREIGHT-HOUSE AT GOODRICH THERE WERE SEVERAL BOXES OF OLD BROKEN-UP BATTERIES
AND BY THE GIVING OFF OF LARGE QUANTITIES OF THAT GAS WITHIN THE COMBUSTION ZONE PERFECT AND ECONOMICAL COMBUSTION OF COAL COULD NOT BE EFFECTED
AT THAT OCCASION IT WAS POINTED OUT TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD MAKE EVERY POSSIBLE SACRIFICE TO GO THAT THE COMPLIMENT WAS GREAT AND THAT BUT FEW AMERICANS HAD BEEN SO RECOGNIZED
IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE KILLED ME IF IT HAD NOT MISSED
IN FACT THOSE WHO KNOW HIM BEST ARE CONTINUALLY SURPRISED AT HIS MODERATION AND PATIENCE OFTEN WHEN THERE HAS BEEN GREAT PROVOCATION

THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN REMARKED
THERE IS IN EACH CASE AN OPEN WIRE CIRCUIT WHICH IS CLOSED BY PRESSING THE BUTTON OR TURNING THE SWITCH THUS MAKING A COMPLETE AND UNINTERRUPTED PATH IN WHICH THE CURRENT MAY TRAVEL AND DO ITS WORK
I FINALLY GOT IT DOWN TO TWENTY-TWO CENTS AND SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS
HE WORE A RATHER SEEDY BLACK DIAGONAL PRINCE ALBERT COAT AND WAISTCOAT WITH TROUSERS OF A DARK MATERIAL AND A WHITE SILK HANDKERCHIEF AROUND HIS NECK TIED IN A CARELESS KNOT FALLING OVER THE STIFF BOSOM OF A WHITE SHIRT SOMEWHAT THE WORSE FOR WEAR
THE EDISON COMPANIES SOON NUMBERING ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FORMED THEIR OWN ASSOCIATION--STILL MAINTAINED AS A SEPARATE AND USEFUL BODY--AND THE LINES WERE TENSELY DRAWN IN A WAY THAT MADE IT NONE TOO EASY FOR THE EDISON SERVICE TO ADVANCE OR FOR AN IMPARTIAL MAN TO REMAIN FRIENDLY WITH BOTH SIDES
AT LAST EDISON WAS OVERPERSUADED AND ALL DIRTY AND PERSPIRING AS HE WAS RECEIVED THE MEDAL RATHER THAN CAUSE THE VISITOR TO COME AGAIN
ON THIS COMBINATION I OBTAINED A PATENT WHICH IS NOW UNIVERSALLY USED IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT IN DUE COURSE THE ENGINE BUILDERS OF THE UNITED STATES DEVELOPED A VARIETY OF EXCELLENT PRIME MOVERS FOR ELECTRIC-LIGHT AND POWER PLANTS AND WERE GRATEFUL TO THE ART FROM WHICH SUCH A STIMULUS CAME TO THEIR INDUSTRY
YOU WANT TO ALLOW HIGH PRESSURE WHEREVER THE CONDITIONS ARE SUCH THAT BY NO POSSIBLE ACCIDENT COULD THAT PRESSURE GET INTO THE HOUSES OF THE CONSUMERS

ALL HIS ASSISTANTS AGREE THAT EDISON IS THE MOST PATIENT TIRELESS EXPERIMENTER THAT COULD BE CONCEIVED OF
THE EUROPEAN COMPANY WITH 3,500,000 FRANCS SUBSCRIBED
PRODUCED BY CHARLES KELLER AND DAVID WIDGER EDISON HIS LIFE AND INVENTIONS BY FRANK LEWIS DYER GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE EDISON LABORATORY AND ALLIED INTERESTS AND THOMAS COMMERFORD MARTIN EX-PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS CONTENTS INTRODUCTION I
IN CASE HE RETIRED OR FAILED HE COULD TRANSFER HIS RIGHT AND EMPLOYEES WERE CONSTANTLY ON THE ALERT FOR PURCHASABLE RIGHTS WHICH COULD BE DISPOSED OF AT A PROFIT
ALL THE WORLD KNOWS THAT HE LOST
3 SOME WERE MADE AND USED IN THE OFFICE OF THE AUTOMATIC COMPANY
WORK WAS SOON RESUMED AT LOUISVILLE WHERE THE DILAPIDATED OLD OFFICE OCCUPIED AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR ONE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE AND LUXURIOUS IN ITS EQUIPMENT
MR DREYER ASKED GOEBEL TO PRODUCE AN OLD LAMP AND WAS ESPECIALLY ANXIOUS TO FIND ONE PENDING HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EDISON COMPANY FOR THE SALE OF GOEBEL'S INVENTIONS
GENERALLY PEOPLE WAIT TO HAVE THE NEW THING BROUGHT TO THEM
THROUGH A 200-MESH SCREEN
BUT THIS WAS NOT AT ALL IN ACCORD WITH MR EDISON'S IDEA WHICH WAS TO PROVE BY ACTUAL EXPERIENCE THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF THE SYSTEM AND THEN TO LICENSE CENTRAL-STATION COMPANIES IN LARGE CITIES AND TOWNS THE PARENT COMPANY TAKING A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR CAPITAL FOR THE LICENSE UNDER THE EDISON PATENTS AND CONTRACTING ALSO FOR THE SUPPLY OF APPARATUS LAMPS ETC
WHEN I GOT IT ALL READY HE HAD ALL HIS DIVISION ENGINEERS COME ON TO NEW YORK AND THEY CAME OVER HERE
THESE VARIOUS INVENTIONS WERE MOSTLY IN THE LINE OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE ART AS IT PROGRESSED DURING THOSE EARLY YEARS BUT OUT OF IT ALL CAME THE EDISON UNIVERSAL PRINTER WHICH ENTERED INTO VERY EXTENSIVE USE AND WHICH IS STILL USED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND IN SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT AT THIS VERY DAY
THE RECEIVING INSTRUMENT AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE WAS CONSTRUCTED UPON MUCH THE SAME GENERAL LINES AS THE TRANSMITTER CONSISTING OF A METALLIC DRUM AND REELS FOR THE PAPER TAPE
ALTOGETHER THERE WERE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY OF THESE IMMENSE MAGNETS IN THE PLANT DISTRIBUTED IN VARIOUS BUILDINGS IN BATTERIES AS ABOVE MENTIONED THE CRUSHED ROCK CONTAINING THE IRON ORE BEING DELIVERED TO THEM BY CONVEYORS AND THE GANGUE AND ORE BEING TAKEN AWAY AFTER SEPARATION BY TWO OTHER CONVEYORS AND DELIVERED ELSEWHERE
SHORTLY AFTER THIS HE WAS INVITED TO CONSTRUCT FOR THE EDISON PEARL STREET STATION THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF ENGINES FOR SO-CALLED STEAM-DYNAMOS EACH INDEPENDENTLY DRIVEN BY A DIRECT-COUPLED ENGINE
THAT WAS A POSER TO ME FOR A FIVE-HOURS RUN WAS ABOUT ALL THAT HAD BEEN REQUIRED UP TO THAT TIME
HENCE PROVISION WAS MADE FOR CARRYING A LARGE STOCK OF OIL AND FOR GIVING A CERTAIN PERIOD OF REST TO THAT ALREADY USED
HE RETURNED TO HIS WORK
IF HE IS ONLY SQUARE HE IS BOUND TO GET BACK ON HIS FEET
THIS PROBLEM WAS OF MOST DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED KIND AND I BENT ALL MY ENERGIES TOWARD ITS SOLUTION
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT BOY I SAID
A SHORT TIME BEFORE PAY-DAY OUR TREASURER CALLED ME UP BY TELEPHONE AND SAID

THE ORIGINAL TIN-FOIL MACHINE HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO ILLUSTRATE THE FACT THAT THE HUMAN VOICE AND OTHER SOUNDS COULD BE RECORDED AND REPRODUCED BUT SUCH A TYPE OF MACHINE HAD SHARP LIMITATIONS IN GENERAL USE
IN THE LIST OF EDISON'S PATENTS AT THE END OF THIS WORK MAY BE NOTED MANY OTHER OF HIS MISCELLANEOUS INVENTIONS COVERING ITEMS SUCH AS PRESERVING FRUIT IN VACUO MAKING PLATE-GLASS DRAWING WIRE AND METALLURGICAL PROCESSES FOR TREATMENT OF NICKEL GOLD AND COPPER ORES
IT WAS RENEWED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN INNUMERABLE WAYS UNTIL SUCCESS HAD BEEN ATTAINED
THE FIREMAN HID BEHIND THE BOILER AND THE ENGINEER JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW
A GREAT VARIETY OF ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN EDISON'S INVENTIONS MANY OF THESE IN FUNDAMENTAL OR EARLIER FORMS BEING DEVISED FOR HIS SYSTEMS OF LIGHT AND POWER AS NOTED ALREADY
HENCE IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THEM FAR ASTRAY FROM THE CORRECT THEORY OF SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT

IF THE KEY IS DEPRESSED THE ARMATURE IS ATTRACTED AND ITS BENT END IS MOVED UPWARD DEPRESSING THE SPRING WHICH MAKES CONTACT WITH THE UPPER SCREW WHICH PLACES THE BATTERY TO THE LINE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY BREAKS THE GROUND CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SPRING AND THE UPTURNED END OF THE LEVER AS SHOWN AT THE LEFT
AS THOUGH THE REAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS YOUNG MAN BARELY THIRTY WERE NOT TANGIBLE AND SOLID ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ADMIRATION OF HIS GENIUS THE YELLOW JOURNALISTS OF THE PERIOD BEGAN BUSILY TO CREATE AN EDISON MYTH WITH GROSS ABSURDITIES OF ASSERTION AND ATTRIBUTION FROM WHICH THE MODEST SUBJECT OF IT ALL HAS NOT YET CEASED TO SUFFER WITH UNTHINKING PEOPLE

THE NEW-COMERS LIKE EDISON BERLINER BLAKE HUGHES GRAY DOLBEAR AND OTHERS BROUGHT A WEALTH OF IDEAS A FUND OF MECHANICAL INGENUITY AND AN INVENTIVE ABILITY WHICH SOON MADE THE TELEPHONE ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE GAINS OF THE CENTURY AND ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE ADDITIONS TO HUMAN RESOURCES

AS A MATTER OF FACT A GREAT MANY OF THE EDISON MEN HAVE MADE NOTABLE INVENTIONS OF THEIR OWN WITH WHICH THEIR NAMES ARE IMPERISHABLY ASSOCIATED
DID MR BLANK HAVE CHARGE OF THIS STATION YES DID HE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RUNNING A STATION LIKE THIS CHINNOCK SAID
BUT FOR SOME REASON HE COULD SEND MESSAGES ALL RIGHT WHEN THE TRAIN WENT IN ONE DIRECTION BUT COULD NOT MAKE IT GO IN THE CONTRARY DIRECTION

IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT IN THE EDISON FAMILY THE PRONUNCIATION OF THE NAME HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH THE LONG E SOUND AS IT WOULD NATURALLY BE IN THE DUTCH LANGUAGE
THAT IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OUT OF THOUSANDS THAT TO ME PROVE BEYOND THE POSSIBILITY OF A DOUBT THAT SOME VAST INTELLIGENCE IS GOVERNING THIS AND OTHER PLANETS A FEW WORDS AS TO THE DOMESTIC AND PERSONAL SIDE OF EDISON'S LIFE TO WHICH MANY INCIDENTAL REFERENCES HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE IN THESE PAGES
HOWEVER IN PASSING A WHOLESALE TEA-HOUSE HE SAW A MAN TASTING TEA SO HE WENT IN AND ASKED THE TASTER IF HE MIGHT HAVE SOME OF THE TEA
INFRINGEMENT WAS NOT HOWEVER CONFINED TO THE LAMP ALONE BUT IN AMERICA EXTENDED ALL ALONG THE LINE OF EDISON'S PATENTS RELATING TO THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRIC LIGHT INCLUDING THOSE ON DYNAMOS MOTORS DISTRIBUTING SYSTEMS SOCKETS SWITCHES AND OTHER DETAILS WHICH HE HAD FROM TIME TO TIME INVENTED
EDISON ARRANGED ACCORDING TO DATES OF EXECUTION OF APPLICATIONS FOR SUCH PATENTS
THESE HOWEVER SHOWED ONLY THE SUPERIORITY OF CERTAIN PROPORTIONS OF THE MATERIALS
AS WILL HAVE BEEN GATHERED FROM THE ABOVE THE PRINCIPLE EMBODIED IN THE QUADRUPLEX IS THAT OF WORKING OVER THE LINE WITH TWO CURRENTS FROM EACH END THAT DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER IN STRENGTH OR NATURE SO THAT THEY WILL AFFECT ONLY INSTRUMENTS ADAPTED TO RESPOND TO JUST SUCH CURRENTS AND NO OTHERS
WHILE HE HAD BEEN PURSUING HIS INVESTIGATIONS OF THE GENERATOR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EXPERIMENTS ON THE INCANDESCENT LAMP HE GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO THE QUESTION OF DISTRIBUTION OF THE CURRENT OVER LARGE AREAS REVOLVING IN HIS MIND VARIOUS PLANS FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THIS PURPOSE AND KEEPING HIS MATHEMATICIANS VERY BUSY WORKING ON THE VARIOUS SCHEMES THAT SUGGESTED THEMSELVES FROM TIME TO TIME
QUOTATIONS WERE TRANSMITTED BY THE MORSE TELEGRAPH FROM THE FLOOR OF THE STOCK EXCHANGE TO THE CENTRAL AND THENCE DISTRIBUTED TO THE SUBSCRIBERS
IT SEEMS INEXPLICABLE AT FIRST VIEW THAT A SYSTEM OF TELEGRAPHY SUFFICIENTLY RAPID AND ECONOMICAL TO BE PRACTICALLY AVAILABLE FOR IMPORTANT BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO DISUSE

HENCE JUST PRIOR TO THE LATTER-NAMED PERIOD THE INSTRUMENT WAS STILL IN ITS TIN-FOIL AGE
THERE HE MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF PROFESSOR TYNDALL EXHIBITED THE TELEPHONE TO THE LATE KING OF ENGLAND
THE LIST OF MR EDISON'S PATENTS SEE APPENDICES IS NOT ONLY A MONUMENT TO HIS LIFE'S WORK BUT SERVES TO SHOW WHAT SUBJECTS HE HAS WORKED ON FROM YEAR TO YEAR SINCE 1868
MR BATCHELOR'S JUDGMENT AND GOOD SENSE WERE ALWAYS IN EVIDENCE
AND A WIRE CONNECTED TO X TRIED BOTH COPPER AND IRON CARRIED OVER TO THE STOVE ABOUT TWENTY FEET DISTANT
THE WHOLE INTELLECTUAL ATMOSPHERE OF BOSTON WAS FAVORABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BROODING GENIUS IN THIS SHY AWKWARD STUDIOUS YOUTH UTTERLY INDIFFERENT TO CLOTHES AND PERSONAL APPEARANCE BUT READY TO SPEND HIS LAST DOLLAR ON BOOKS AND SCIENTIFIC PARAPHERNALIA
AT A POINT A LITTLE BEYOND ITS CENTRE IS A SMALL PIECE OF INSULATING MATERIAL TO WHICH IS SCREWED A STRIP OF SPRING METAL S
MR EDISON DEMONSTRATED PERSONALLY THE DETAILS AND MERITS OF THE SYSTEM TO THEM
17 1890 460,123 PHONOGRAM BLANK CARRIER
THIS CRITIC CONCLUDES WITH A GENTLE REBUKE TO THE INVENTOR FOR ILL-TIMED JESTING AND A SUGGESTION TO FURNISH AUTHENTIC INFORMATION
BUT IT DID AT LAST EMERGE AND MADE GOOD BY 1905 THE PRODUCTION OF LEAD-LEAD STORAGE BATTERIES IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE HAD REACHED A VALUE FOR THE YEAR OF NEARLY $3,000,000 AND IT HAS INCREASED GREATLY SINCE THAT TIME
THIS WAS AGREED TO AND A CELEBRATED BRUISER WAS BROUGHT OVER FROM NEWARK
THIS DIFFICULTY WAS SOLVED BY DIVIDING THE BATTERY AT EACH STATION INTO TWO UNEQUAL PARTS THE SMALLER BATTERY BEING ALWAYS IN CIRCUIT WITH THE POLE-CHANGER READY TO HAVE ITS POLARITY REVERSED ON THE MAIN LINE TO OPERATE THE DISTANT POLAR RELAY BUT THE SPRING RETRACTING THE ARMATURE OF THE NEUTRAL RELAY IS MADE SO STIFF AS TO RESIST THESE WEAK CURRENTS
ON THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF EACH WHEEL WERE THE NUMERALS
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOCAL CIRCUIT WAS PERMANENTLY CONNECTED TO AN INSULATED BLOCK ON THE VIBRATOR
THE LAMP PATENT WAS SUSTAINED IN THE NEW YORK FEDERAL COURT
IN THE MONTH OF MAY THREE OF THESE MACHINES EACH WITH A CAPACITY OF TWELVE HUNDRED INCANDESCENT LAMPS WERE DELIVERED AT PEARL STREET AND ASSEMBLED ON THE SECOND FLOOR
THIS IS WELL ILLUSTRATED IN A STORY RELATING TO HIS INVENTION OF THE TYPE OF STORAGE BATTERY BEARING HIS NAME
HOLDING THE END OF A SKATE-STRAP FOR ANOTHER LAD TO SHORTEN WITH AN AXE HE LOST THE TOP OF A FINGER
AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE PRACTICE THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED IN ALL THE GREAT CITIES OF THE COUNTRY TO-DAY
BUT EVEN THEN THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF RISK AND WASTE
I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK ON THE CITY OF CHESTER ABOUT FIVE OR SIX IN THE EVENING AND WENT DIRECT TO 65 FIFTH AVENUE
465,971 WAS NOT ISSUED UNTIL DECEMBER 29 1891
THEY WERE A TYPICAL EAST SIDE LOT--IGNORANT GENERALLY STUPID INCAPABLE OF LONG MEMORY BUT READY TO OBLIGE A NEIGHBOR AND TO TURN AN EASY DOLLAR BY PUTTING A CROSS-MARK AT THE BOTTOM OF A FORTHCOMING FRIENDLY AFFIDAVIT
HE WOULD FREQUENTLY CHANGE WORDS ALWAYS TO THE BETTERMENT OF THE SPEECH
TARTARIC ACID 5 LBS
THIS WAS AFTERWARD WORKED OUT AND MADE PRACTICAL BY FRANK SPRAGUE
BUT IT WAS EQUIPPED WITH ALL ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS TO DOMINATE AN ART IN WHICH AFTER ITS FIRST EFFORTS IT REMAINED PRACTICALLY SUPINE AND USELESS WHILE OTHER INTERESTS FORGED AHEAD AND REAPED BOTH THE PROFIT AND THE GLORY

IF THIS DISK WAS REMOVED FROM THE MACHINE AND PUT ON A SIMILAR MACHINE PROVIDED WITH A CONTACT POINT THE EMBOSSED RECORD WOULD CAUSE THE SIGNALS TO BE REPEATED INTO ANOTHER WIRE
BUT I NEVER HAD ANY GRUDGE AGAINST HIM BECAUSE HE WAS SO ABLE IN HIS LINE AND AS LONG AS MY PART WAS SUCCESSFUL THE MONEY WITH ME WAS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION
SUCCESS WITH THE STOCK NEWS SYSTEM WAS INSTANTANEOUS

HE CONFRONTED HOUSTON SUDDENLY AND SAM STOPPED AND SAID
ANOTHER IMPORTANT CHANGE WAS IN THE NATURE OF A REVERSAL OF THE ORIGINAL ARRANGEMENT THE CYLINDER OR MANDREL CARRYING THE RECORD BEING MOUNTED IN FIXED BEARINGS AND THE RECORDING OR REPRODUCING DEVICE BEING FED LENGTHWISE LIKE THE CUTTING-TOOL OF A LATHE AS THE BLANK OR RECORD WAS ROTATED
LONG BEFORE THIS SITUATION AROSE IT HAD BEEN RECOGNIZED BY EASTERN IRON-MASTERS THAT SOONER OR LATER THE DEPOSITS OF HIGH-GRADE ORE WOULD BE EXHAUSTED AND IN CONSEQUENCE THERE WOULD ENSUE A COMPELLING NECESSITY TO FALL BACK ON THE LOW-GRADE MAGNETIC ORES
FROM THIS POINT HE SET OUT ON FOOT TO EXPLORE THE CAUCA VALLEY AND THE CORDILLERAS
A VILLAGE SCHOOLMASTER IS NOT UNACCUSTOMED TO DOOR-RAPPINGS
WHEN SUCH A FIT IS ON HIM THE WORD IS QUICKLY PASSED AROUND AND BUT FEW OF HIS ASSOCIATES FIND IT NECESSARY TO CONSULT WITH HIM AT THE TIME
3 1882 274,294 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP NOV
THIS WAS THE PLANT AT SILVER LAKE ABOVE REFERRED TO
24 1900 671,316 APPARATUS FOR SCREENING FINE MATERIALS FEB
I GOT UP A MOTOR AND PUT IT ON THE SCALES AND TRIED A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND CONTRIVANCES CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR TO SEE HOW IT WOULD LIGHTEN ITSELF ON THE SCALES
I PASSED EDISON'S LETTER THROUGH THE WINDOW FOR HIS INSPECTION
HOWEVER WE WERE SHORT OF MONEY FOR PAY-ROLLS
AND MEANTIME OTHER WORK HAD BEEN ADVANCED
AND THE ITEMS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AN INTERVIEW
ONE NIGHT I HEARD A KNOCK AT THE OFFICE DOOR AND ON OPENING IT SAW TWO WELL-DRESSED LADIES WHO ASKED IF THEY MIGHT BE SHOWN THROUGH
20 FOOTNOTE 20
ONE OF THE WORKMEN I HAD AT MENLO PARK WAS JOHN KRUESI WHO AFTERWARD BECAME FROM HIS EXPERIENCE ENGINEER OF THE LIGHTING STATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY ENGINEER OF THE EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC WORKS AT SCHENECTADY
HIS SLEEP WAS ALWAYS INSTANT PROFOUND AND RESTFUL
THE ONLY THING I CAN BE PROUD OF IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLANT IS THE FACT THAT I DID NOT DESIGN IT THAT ONCE IN A WHILE WE MADE OUT TO PAY ITS OPERATING EXPENSES AND THAT OCCASIONALLY WE COULD RUN IT FOR THREE MONTHS WITHOUT A TOTAL BREAKDOWN IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1885 THAT THE FIRST EDISON STATION IN GERMANY WAS ESTABLISHED
THE ARMATURE CIRCUIT HAD A SWITCH IN IT WHICH PERMITTED THE LOCOMOTIVE TO BE REVERSED BY REVERSING THE DIRECTION OF CURRENT FLOW THROUGH THE ARMATURE
EACH RECOGNIZED THE SPECIAL ABILITY OF THE OTHER AND BARELY A WEEK AFTER THE FAMOUS EVENTS OF BLACK FRIDAY THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THEIR PARTNERSHIP APPEARED IN THE TELEGRAPHER OF OCTOBER 1 1869
CALLAHAN MADE THE FURTHER INNOVATION OF INSULATING HIS CIRCUIT WIRES ALTHOUGH THE COST WAS THEN FORTY TIMES AS GREAT AS THAT OF BARE WIRE
AFTER MANY MONTHS OF UNREMITTING TOIL AND RESEARCH AND THE TRIAL OF THOUSANDS OF EXPERIMENTS THE GOAL WAS REACHED IN THE COMPLETION OF A SUCCESSFUL FORMULA FOR AGGLOMERATING THE FINE ORE AND PRESSING IT INTO BRIQUETTES BY SPECIAL MACHINERY THIS WAS THE FINAL PROCESS REQUISITE FOR THE MAKING OF A COMPLETED COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
THERE IS NOTHING OF THE HELTER-SKELTER SLAP-DASH STYLE IN EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS
WASHINGTON PEOPLE TELEGRAPHED ME TO COME ON
THE FIRST PRACTICAL USE OF THE SYSTEM TOOK PLACE ON A THIRTEEN-MILE STRETCH OF THE STATEN ISLAND RAILROAD WITH THE RESULTS MENTIONED BY EDISON ABOVE
SECURING ITS IMPORT DUTIES IN THE PRECIOUS METAL AND THUS ASSISTING TO CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL STRINGENCY IN THE GOLD MARKET THE GOVERNMENT HAD MADE IT A PRACTICE TO RELIEVE THE SITUATION BY SELLING A MILLION OF GOLD EACH MONTH
IT WAS A TRIUMPHANT VINDICATION OF EDISON'S REASONING POWERS HIS CLEAR PERCEPTIONS HIS INSIGHT INTO POSSIBILITIES AND HIS INVENTIVE FACULTY ALL OF WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN PRODUCTIVE OF SO MANY STARTLING PRACTICAL AND EPOCH-MAKING INVENTIONS
THE PURPOSE OF THIS PARTICULAR DEVICE WAS TO PERMIT A VOTE IN THE NATIONAL HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO BE TAKEN IN A MINUTE OR SO COMPLETE LISTS BEING FURNISHED OF ALL MEMBERS VOTING ON THE TWO SIDES OF ANY QUESTION MR EDISON IN RECALLING THE CIRCUMSTANCES SAYS
INCREASED RAPIDITY OF TRANSMISSION MAY HOWEVER BE ACCOMPLISHED BY AUTOMATIC METHODS BY MEANS OF WHICH THROUGH THE EMPLOYMENT OF SUITABLE DEVICES MESSAGES MAY BE STAMPED IN OR UPON A PAPER TAPE TRANSMITTED THROUGH AUTOMATICALLY ACTING INSTRUMENTS AND BE RECEIVED AT DISTANT POINTS IN VISIBLE CHARACTERS UPON A SIMILAR TAPE AT A RATE TWENTY OR MORE TIMES GREATER--A SPEED FAR BEYOND THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE HUMAN HAND TO TRANSMIT OR THE EAR TO RECEIVE
IT IS DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN THE APPENDIX

I SAID TO PASTEUR WILL HE LIVE NO SAID HE THE BOY WILL BE DEAD IN SIX DAYS
I TRIED THIS SEVERAL TIMES FOR TWO DAYS
WITH THE UTILIZATION OF HEAVY CURRENTS AT LOW VOLTAGE IT BECAME NECESSARY OF COURSE TO DEVISE APPARATUS WHICH SHOULD BE ABLE TO PICK UP WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY ONE THOUSAND AMPERES OF CURRENT AT THIS PRESSURE THROUGH TWO INCHES OF MUD IF NECESSARY
OVER THIS WAS TO BE PLACED TINFOIL WHICH EASILY RECEIVED AND RECORDED THE MOVEMENTS OF THE DIAPHRAGM
SEVEN PARTS HYDRATE TO THREE OF FLAKE AND SO ON THROUGH VARYING PROPORTIONS
HENCE THEIR TRAJECTORY IS ALTERED AND THEY FALL ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE PARTITION IN THE BIN WHILE THE NON-MAGNETIC PORTION OF THE STREAM CONTINUES IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND FALLS ON THE OTHER SIDE THUS EFFECTING A COMPLETE SEPARATION
IN EVERY INSTANCE AS IN THIS COUNTRY THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT HAD TO WAIT SEVERAL YEARS FOR IN THE MEAN TIME ANOTHER GREAT ART HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE DEMANDING EXCLUSIVE ATTENTION AND EXHAUSTIVE TOIL
THE REVIEW ABOVE GIVEN AS BRIEFLY AS POSSIBLE COMPRISES SUBSTANTIALLY THE SUM OF THE WORLD'S KNOWLEDGE AT THE TIME THE PROBLEM OF RECORDING AND REPRODUCING ANIMATE MOVEMENT WAS FIRST UNDERTAKEN BY EDISON
THE FREIGHT-LOCOMOTIVE HAD SINGLE REDUCTION GEARS AS IS THE MODERN PRACTICE BUT THE POWER WAS APPLIED THROUGH A FRICTION-CLUTCH THE PASSENGER-LOCOMOTIVE WAS VERY SPEEDY AND NINETY PASSENGERS HAVE BEEN CARRIED AT A TIME BY IT
ONE MORNING ABOUT 2.30 THE LATE CHARLES BATCHELOR ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS TIRED AND WOULD GO TO BED
EMINENT MEN IN SCIENCE WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED THEIR DISBELIEF IN THE STATEMENTS MADE AS TO THE EDISON SYSTEM WERE NOW FOREMOST IN GENEROUS PRAISE OF HIS NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS AND ACCORDED HIM FULL CREDIT FOR ITS COMPLETION
AND NOW WHEN THE EDISON COMPANY AFTER YEARS OF LITIGATION LEAVING BUT A SHORT TIME FOR THE PATENT TO RUN HAVE OBTAINED A FINAL ADJUDICATION ESTABLISHING ITS VALIDITY THIS CLAIM IS AGAIN RESURRECTED TO DEFEAT THE OPERATION OF THE JUDGMENT SO OBTAINED
THE RESULT OF THE DROP IN SUCH A CASE WOULD BE THAT WHILE THE TWO LAMPS OR GROUPS NEAREST THE GENERATOR WOULD BE BURNING AT THEIR PROPER DEGREE OF ILLUMINATION THOSE BEYOND WOULD GIVE LOWER AND LOWER CANDLE-POWER SUCCESSIVELY UNTIL THE LAST LAMP OR GROUP WOULD BE GIVING ONLY ABOUT TWO-THIRDS THE LIGHT OF THE FIRST TWO
WE SAID ALL RIGHT AND BACK THEY WENT
THESE COARSE PARTICLES OR CLINKERS ABSORB WATER VERY SLOWLY ARE PRACTICALLY INERT AND HAVE VERY FEEBLE CEMENTING PROPERTIES
MORE THAN THIS THE MECHANISM FOR OPERATING THE FILM WAS SO CONSTRUCTED THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THE FILM TOOK PLACE IN ONE-TENTH OF THE TIME REQUIRED FOR THE EXPOSURE GIVING THE FILM AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO REST PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE SHUTTER
I HAVE TO MENTION THE NAME OF ONE EXPERT WHOSE TESTIMONY WILL I BELIEVE BE FOUND AS ACCURATE AS SINCERE AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS IF IT WERE THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL
DISMISSING FROM HIS MIND QUICKLY THE COMMERCIAL IMPOSSIBILITY OF USING ARC LIGHTS FOR GENERAL INDOOR ILLUMINATION HE ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT AN ELECTRIC LAMP GIVING LIGHT BY INCANDESCENCE WAS THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM
AFTER I SENT ONE OF MY MEN OVER TO LONDON ESPECIALLY TO SHOW PREECE THE CARBON TRANSMITTER AND WHERE HUGHES FIRST SAW IT AND HEARD IT--THEN WITHIN A MONTH HE CAME OUT WITH THE MICROPHONE WITHOUT ANY ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHATEVER
ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE LENGTH TO WHICH TELEGRAPHERS COULD GO AT A TIME WHEN THEY WERE SO MUCH IN DEMAND EDISON TELLS THE FOLLOWING STORY
I WAS TAKING PRESS REPORT AND THE OTHER MAN WAS WORKING THE NEW YORK WIRE
THE RABBIT PAID NO ATTENTION
THESE HOWEVER ARE FEW IN NUMBER AND AT SOME FUTURE TIME WILL BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE OR MORE ADDITIONAL CONCRETE BUILDINGS
WITHOUT THESE THERE MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN THE ROMANCE OF COPPERS AND THE RISE AND FALL OF COUNTLESS FORTUNES
THE RECORD IS CONSTANTLY ROTATED UNTIL ITS ENTIRE SURFACE IS COATED
WITHOUT THESE MODERN TELEPHONY WOULD NOT AND COULD NOT EXIST
TO SHUT DOWN THE FACTORY MEANT GREAT LOSS AND APPARENT FAILURE
SOUNDS OF ALL KINDS AND VARIETIES WERE HEARD IN EVERY DIRECTION
THE NET RESULT WILL BE THAT THOSE WHO CARE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE PRIVILEGE MAY SOONER OR LATER FORSAKE THE CROWDED APARTMENT OR TENEMENT AND BE COMFORTABLY HOUSED IN SANITARY SUBSTANTIAL AND ROOMY HOMES FITTED WITH MODERN CONVENIENCES AND BEAUTIFIED BY ARTISTIC DECORATIONS WITH NO OUTLAY FOR INSURANCE OR REPAIRS

I THOUGHT IF I EVER GOT OUT OF THAT SCRAPE ALIVE I WOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT THE HABITS OF ANIMALS AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND BE PREPARED FOR ALL KINDS OF MISCHANCE WHEN I UNDERTOOK AN ENTERPRISE
ATTEMPTS TO INSULATE THE LINE WIRE WERE LIMITED TO COATING IT WITH TAR OR SMEARING IT WITH WAX FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL THE BEES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THESE ARE TOO NUMEROUS TO SPECIFY IN DETAIL AS THEY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE VARIOUS RAMIFICATIONS OF THE PLANT BUT THE PRINCIPAL ONES ARE WORTHY OF MENTION SUCH AS
ELECTROPLATING BECAME AN ART AND TELEGRAPHY SPRANG INTO ACTIVE BEING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC
FROM THIS COULD BE MOLDED OR CAST POSITIVE COPIES WHICH WOULD BE IDENTICAL WITH THE ORIGINAL
REGULAR CROPS TOOK THE PLACE OF HAPHAZARD GLEANINGS FROM BRAKE OR PRAIRIE
WHILE THE ENGINES WERE NOT DIRECTLY COUPLED TO THE DYNAMOS IT WAS A CURIOUS FACT THAT THE PISTON SPEEDS AND NUMBER OF REVOLUTIONS WERE WHAT IS COMMON TO-DAY IN ISOLATED DIRECT-COUPLED PLANTS
JOHNSON WAS BROUGHT ON FROM THE DENVER RIO GRANDE RAILWAY TO ASSIST IN THE PRACTICAL INTRODUCTION OF AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHY ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS AND ABOUT THIS TIME IN 1872 I JOINED THE ENTERPRISE

MR EDISON NARRATES IT AS FOLLOWS
THE DEMONSTRATION OF THIS INITIAL CAR HAS BEEN WATCHED WITH INTEREST BY MANY RAILROAD OFFICIALS AND ITS PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN OF SO SUCCESSFUL A NATURE THAT AT THE PRESENT WRITING THE SUMMER OF 1910 IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE AND EQUIP A PRELIMINARY FACTORY IN WHICH TO CONSTRUCT MANY OTHER CARS OF A SIMILAR TYPE THAT HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY OTHER STREET-RAILWAY COMPANIES

I GOT UP A METHOD SAYS EDISON OF SEPARATING PLACER GOLD BY A DRY PROCESS IN WHICH I COULD WORK ECONOMICALLY ORE AS LEAN AS FIVE CENTS OF GOLD TO THE CUBIC YARD
IN LATER LIFE EDISON HAS BEEN MORE CIRCUMSPECT BUT THROUGHOUT HIS EARLY CAREER HE WAS CONSTANTLY GETTING INTO SOME KIND OF SCRAPE
THIS IS SUFFICIENT TO NOT ONLY NEUTRALIZE THE MAGNETISM WHICH THE CURRENT IN WIRE B WOULD TEND TO SET UP BUT ALSO--BY REASON OF THE EXCESS OF CURRENT IN WIRE A--TO MAKE THE BAR A MAGNET WHOSE POLARITY WOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOW OF CURRENT AROUND IT

WEEKS WERE SPENT IN THIS PARADISIACAL ISLE
THE IMPOSSIBLE SO CALLED HAD BEEN ATTAINED
INDEED IT MUST BE STATED HERE THAT ONCE IN A WHILE THIS CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN ABUSED
IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY IS THE FAMOUS STOCK-ROOM ABOUT WHICH MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND INVENTED
FRANK J
EDISON SAYS WITH REGARD TO THIS WORK
INDEED IT WAS NOT UNTIL MORE THAN TWELVE YEARS AFTERWARD IN 1887 UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THE NOTABLE WORK OF PROF H
IMMEDIATELY NEW PROCESSES OF INESTIMABLE VALUE REVEALED THEMSELVES
HE RODE ON IT
BY THE TIME I HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE APPARATUS TO WORK ELLSWORTH SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
EXTENSIVE AS THIS INDUSTRY MAY BECOME HOWEVER EDISON IS FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT THE GREATEST FIELD FOR HIS STORAGE BATTERY LIES IN ITS ADAPTATION TO COMMERCIAL TRUCKING AND HAULING AND TO PLEASURE VEHICLES IN COMPARISON WITH WHICH THE STREET-CAR BUSINESS EVEN WITH ITS GREAT POSSIBILITIES--WILL NOT AMOUNT TO MORE THAN 1 PER CENT
HIS EYES WERE BLOODSHOT AND HE WAS SOMEWHAT INEBRIATED
HE COMMENCED TO RECITE BIBLICAL NAMES WITH IMMENSE RAPIDITY
SO THAT EVEN WITH THE AID OF SPEAKING-TUBES AND TRUMPETS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXCEED SOMEWHAT NARROW LIMITS
THIS STUDY WAS SO EXHAUSTIVE THAT ONE CAN ONLY COMPARE IT TO THE CAREFUL INVESTIGATION MADE IN ADVANCE BY ANY COMPETENT WAR STAFF OF THE ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS ON BOTH SIDES IN A POSSIBLE CAMPAIGN
I LEFT AT 3.30 A.M
ON THE PRECEDING FRIDAY ALL THE APPARATUS WHICH INCLUDED A LARGE INDUCTION-COIL WAS SHIPPED FROM ORANGE TO NEW YORK AND ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON EDISON ACCOMPANIED BY FRED OTT ONE OF HIS ASSISTANTS AND MYSELF WENT OVER TO INSTALL IT SO AS TO HAVE IT READY FOR MONDAY MORNING
THE MOMENT THEY GOT THEIR LEGS ACROSS BOTH STRIPS THERE WAS A FLASH OF LIGHT AND THE COCKROACHES WENT INTO GAS
WHEN THEY GOT TO CLEVELAND IT DAWNED UPON THEM THAT THEY HAD NOT DONE ANY BUSINESS SO THEY HAD TO COME BACK ON THE NEXT TRAIN TO NEW YORK TO TRANSACT IT
AND SPENT IT WAS FOR WITH ACCESS TO DETROIT AND ITS LARGE STORES WHERE HE BOUGHT HIS SUPPLIES AND TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY WHERE HE COULD QUENCH HIS THIRST FOR TECHNICAL INFORMATION EDISON GAVE UP ALL HIS SPARE TIME AND MONEY TO CHEMISTRY
THE OTHER INSTANCE REFERRED TO OCCURRED SHORTLY AFTER THE EDISON MACHINE WORKS WAS MOVED UP TO SCHENECTADY IN 1886
AND HE AGREED TO TAKE THE JOB ON ONE CONDITION--NAMELY THAT JOHNSON WOULD STAY AND HELP AS HE WAS A MAN WITH IDEAS MR JOHNSON WAS ACCORDINGLY GIVEN THREE MONTHS LEAVE FROM COLORADO RAILROAD-BUILDING AND HAS NEVER SEEN COLORADO SINCE APPLYING HIMSELF TO THE DIFFICULTIES WITH WONTED ENERGY EDISON DEVISED NEW APPARATUS AND SOLVED THE PROBLEM TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE AND HIS ASSISTANTS SUCCEEDED IN TRANSMITTING AND RECORDING ONE THOUSAND WORDS PER MINUTE BETWEEN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON AND THIRTY-FIVE HUNDRED WORDS PER MINUTE TO PHILADELPHIA
IF SUCH A MIXTURE BE POURED INTO DEEP MOLDS THE HEAVY STONE AND SAND SETTLE TO THE BOTTOM
THE VERTICALS OF THE LETTERS WERE PERFORATED ONLY FOUR HOLES HIGH AND THE FOUR ROLLERS WERE ARRANGED IN PAIRS ONE PAIR BEING SLIGHTLY IN ADVANCE OF THE OTHER
THE LIGHTING SYSTEM THAT EDISON CONTEMPLATED IN THIS ENTIRELY NEW DEPARTURE FROM ANTECEDENT METHODS INCLUDED THE GENERATION OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY OR CURRENT ON A VERY LARGE SCALE
BUT THEY TOOK WHATEVER WAS NEEDED FROM HIS SYSTEM AND HE HAS NEVER HAD A CENT FROM THEM ARDUOUS WORK WAS AT ONCE RESUMED AT HOME ON DUPLEX AND QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPHY JUST AS THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN NO INTERMISSION OR DISCOURAGEMENT OVER DOTS TWENTY-SEVEN FEET LONG
IN ANOTHER PLACE THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN TOLD THE STORY OF THE TELEPHONE FROM WHICH WE HAVE SEEN THAT TO ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL IS DUE THE BROAD IDEA OF TRANSMISSION OF SPEECH BY MEANS OF AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT
WHILE THOSE BATAVIAN ANCESTORS ON THE LOW SHORES OF THE ZUYDER ZEE DEVOTED THEIR ENERGIES TO GRINDING GRAIN HE HAS BEEN NOT LESS ASSIDUOUS THAN THEY IN REDUCING THE ROCKS OF THE EARTH ITSELF TO FLOUR
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WHOLE WORLD THAT IN ANY WAY APPROXIMATED A SOLUTION ALTHOUGH THE MOST BRILLIANT MINDS IN THE ELECTRICAL ART HAD BEEN ASSIDUOUSLY WORKING ON THE SUBJECT FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY PRECEDING
IT IS JUST FIFTY YEARS SINCE ANOTHER FRENCHMAN NAMED PLANTE DISCOVERED THAT ON TAKING TWO THIN PLATES OF SHEET LEAD IMMERSING THEM IN DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID AND PASSING AN ELECTRIC CURRENT THROUGH THE CELL THE COMBINATION EXHIBITED THE ABILITY TO GIVE BACK PART OF THE ORIGINAL CHARGING CURRENT OWING TO THE CHEMICAL CHANGES AND REACTIONS SET UP
CONTEMPORANEOUSLY HE AND HIS FORCE OF MEN WERE VERY BUSILY ENGAGED DAY AND NIGHT ON OTHER IMPORTANT ENTERPRISES AND INVENTIONS
THAT THE WILD OUTBURSTS OF INSURRECTION MIDWAY IN THE FIFTH DECADE FAILED AND DIED AWAY WAS NOT SURPRISING FOR THE SUPERINCUMBENT DEPOSITS OF TRADITION AND CONVENTION WERE THICK
THE THREE-WIRE SYSTEM IS IN UNIVERSAL USE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AT THE PRESENT DAY
THIS STIRRED UP A GREAT DEAL OF AMBITION AMONG THE BOYS TO PUSH THE FIGURES UP
IF IT FAILS ON ITS MERITS HE DOESN'T WORRY OR FRET ABOUT IT BUT ON THE CONTRARY REGARDS IT AS A USEFUL FACT LEARNED
AS THE GENERAL CONCEPTION AND THEORY OF A LAWSUIT IS THE RECOVERY OF SOME MATERIAL BENEFIT THE LAY MIND IS APT TO CONCEIVE OF GREAT SUMS OF MONEY BEING AWARDED TO A COMPLAINANT BY WAY OF DAMAGES UPON A FAVORABLE DECISION IN AN IMPORTANT PATENT CASE
THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT THIS EXPLANATION WILL REVEAL A STATUS OF EDISON IN RELATION TO THE SUBJECT THAT HAS THUS FAR BEEN UNKNOWN TO THE PUBLIC
SUNBURY WAS ALSO PROVIDED WITH THE FIRST ELECTRO-CHEMICAL METERS USED IN THE UNITED STATES OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY SO THAT IT SERVED ALSO TO ACCENTUATE ELECTRICAL PRACTICE IN A MOST VITAL RESPECT--NAMELY THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY SUPPLIED TO CUSTOMERS
THESE ALCOVES ARE FORMED BY RACKS EXTENDING FROM FLOOR TO CEILING FITTED WITH SHELVES EXCEPT ON TWO SIDES OF BOTH GALLERIES WHERE THEY ARE FORMED BY A SERIES OF GLASS-FRONTED CABINETS CONTAINING EXTENSIVE COLLECTIONS OF CURIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL MINERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS AMONG WHICH IS THE NOTABLE TIFFANY-KUNZ COLLECTION OF MINERALS ACQUIRED BY EDISON SOME YEARS AGO
AT THE CENTRE OF THE ROOF THERE WILL BE NOTED A FUNNEL-SHAPED OPENING
HE TOOK A TRAIN FOR HOME AT 5.30 IN THE AFTERNOON AND ON ARRIVING AT HIS RESIDENCE AT ORANGE GOT OUT SOME NOTE-BOOKS AND BEGAN TO WRITE ENTIRELY FROM MEMORY EACH ITEM CONSECUTIVELY
AT THE SAME TIME I WAS ORDERED TO SEND TWENTY YOUNG MEN AFTER TEACHING THEM TO BECOME EXPERT
WHAT HE SOUGHT WAS A PERFECTLY UNIFORM AND HOMOGENEOUS CARBON ONE LIKE THE ONE-HOSS SHAY THAT HAD NO WEAK SPOTS TO BREAK DOWN AT INOPPORTUNE TIMES
THE CHARACTERS WHICH HE WAS THUS FORMING ON THE PAPER WERE HIGH ENOUGH IN RELIEF TO BE LEGIBLE TO THE DELICATE TOUCH OF A BLIND MAN'S FINGERS AND WITH SIMPLE APPARATUS LETTERS COULD BE THUS WRITTEN SENT AND READ
SIXTH--TO DESIGN EFFICIENT DYNAMOS SUCH NOT BEING IN EXISTENCE AT THE TIME THAT WOULD CONVERT ECONOMICALLY THE STEAM-POWER OF HIGH-SPEED ENGINES INTO ELECTRICAL ENERGY TOGETHER WITH MEANS FOR CONNECTING AND DISCONNECTING THEM WITH THE EXTERIOR CONSUMPTION CIRCUITS
NOR IS THE CONFUSION LESS CONFOUNDED THROUGH EFFORTS MADE ON THE PART OF DISHONEST PERSONS WHO LIKE VULTURES FOLLOW CLOSELY ON THE TRAIL OF SUCCESSFUL INVENTORS AND SOMETIMES THROUGH INFORMATION DERIVED BY UNDERHAND METHODS OBTAIN PATENTS ON ALLEGED INVENTIONS CLOSELY APPROXIMATING THE REAL ONES SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF HARASSING THE ORIGINAL PATENTEE UNTIL THEY ARE BOUGHT UP OR ELSE WITH THE INTENT OF COMPETING BOLDLY IN THE NEW BUSINESS TRUST IN THE DELAYS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO OBTAIN A SURE FOOTHOLD IN THEIR QUESTIONABLE ENTERPRISE
WRITING IN 1878 IN THE NORTH AMERICAN-REVIEW MR EDISON THUS SUMMED UP HIS OWN IDEAS AS TO THE FUTURE APPLICATIONS OF THE NEW INVENTION
VILLARD COULD NOT SEE A SINGLE POINT AND SCARCELY LAUGHED AT ALL
I POURED IN A BEAKERFUL OF WATER AND THE WHOLE THING EXPLODED AND THREW A LOT OF IT INTO MY EYES
THE COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURE OF BUILT-UP SHEETS OF MICA FOR ELECTRICAL PURPOSES WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED AT THE EDISON MACHINE WORKS GOERCK STREET NEW YORK IN 1881 ELEMENTARY AS THESE PRINCIPLES WILL APPEAR TO THE MODERN STUDENT OR ENGINEER THEY WERE DENOUNCED AS NOTHING SHORT OF ABSURDITY AT THE TIME OF THEIR PROMULGATION--ESPECIALLY SO WITH REGARD TO EDISON'S PROPOSAL TO UPSET THE THEN SETTLED DICTUM THAT THE ARMATURE RESISTANCE SHOULD BE EQUAL TO THE EXTERNAL RESISTANCE
A STATEMENT OF WHAT HAD TO BE DONE IN THOSE DAYS OF ACTUAL AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC ELECTRICAL DARKNESS IS QUITE SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN TYNDALL'S ATTITUDE OF MIND IN PREFERRING THAT THE PROBLEM SHOULD BE IN EDISON'S HANDS RATHER THAN IN HIS OWN
NOW THE LAST OF THE IMPORTANT BAMBOO-PRODUCING COUNTRIES IN THE GLOBE CIRCUIT HAD BEEN DONE AND THE HOME-LAP WAS IN ORDER
I NOTICED THAT THEY ALL WENT TO ROOST JUST BEFORE TOTALITY
I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
VERITY WHOSE FIRM BUILT MANY OF THE FIXTURES FOR THE EDISON COMPANY AND CONSTRUCTED THE NOTABLE ELECTROLIERS SHOWN AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE EXPOSITION OF 1882 WE HAVE MADE A SWIFT SURVEY OF DEVELOPMENTS FROM THE TIME WHEN THE SYSTEM OF LIGHTING WAS READY FOR USE AND WHEN THE STAFF SCATTERED TO INTRODUCE IT
ETHERIC FORCE.--CHARLEY EDISON HUNG TO THE GAS-PIPE WITH FEET ABOVE THE FLOOR AND WITH A KNIFE GOT A SPARK FROM THE PIPE HE WAS HANGING ON
WEIR COOLLY ASKED FOR A PEN AND WHEN HE SAT DOWN THE SENDER WAS JUST ONE MESSAGE AHEAD OF HIM WITH DATE ADDRESS AND SIGNATURE
TO A CASUAL VISITOR THE FIRST VIEW OF THIS HETEROGENEOUS COLLECTION IS QUITE BEWILDERING BUT ON MORE MATURE EXAMINATION IT RESOLVES ITSELF INTO A NATURAL CLASSIFICATION--AS FOR INSTANCE OBJECTS PERTAINING TO VARIOUS ANIMALS BIRDS AND FISHES SUCH AS SKINS HIDES HAIR FUR FEATHERS WOOL QUILLS DOWN BRISTLES TEETH BONES HOOFS HORNS TUSKS SHELLS
THE GREAT MODERN ART OF TELEPHONY HAS HAD THUS IN ITS BEGINNINGS ITS EVOLUTION AND ITS PRESENT STATUS AS A UNIVERSAL MEDIUM OF INTERCOURSE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF SURPRISE MYSTERY SWIFT CREATION OF WEALTH TRAGIC INTERLUDES AND COLOSSAL BATTLE THAT CAN APPEAL TO THE IMAGINATION AND HOLD PUBLIC ATTENTION
THEN THEY SAID THE CURVES WERE VERY SHORT
PROFESSOR HOUSTON OF PHILADELPHIA AMONG OTHERS HAS REPEATED SOME OF THESE PHYSICAL EXPERIMENTS HAS ADOPTED IN FULL AND AFTER BUT A PARTIAL STUDY OF THE SUBJECT THE HYPOTHESIS OF RAPIDLY REVERSED ELECTRICITY AS SUGGESTED IN MY LETTER TO THE TRIBUNE OF DECEMBER 8TH AND FURTHER CLAIMS PRIORITY OF DISCOVERY BECAUSE HE OBSERVED THE SPARK OF THIS WHEN EXPERIMENTING WITH A RUHMKORFF COIL FOUR YEARS AGO
THE ACTIVITIES OF EDISON HAVE BEEN OF SUCH GREAT RANGE AND HIS CONQUESTS IN THE DOMAINS OF PRACTICAL ARTS SO EXTENSIVE AND VARIED THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE WITH ANY SATISFACTORY DEGREE OF ACCURACY THE MONEY VALUE OF HIS INVENTIONS TO THE WORLD OF TO-DAY EVEN AFTER MAKING DUE ALLOWANCE FOR THE WORK OF OTHER GREAT INVENTORS AND THE PROPULSIVE EFFECT OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL THROWN INTO THE ENTERPRISES WHICH TOOK ROOT WHOLLY OR IN PART THROUGH THE PRODUCTIONS OF HIS GENIUS AND ENERGIES
TO THIS QUERY HE HAS INVARIABLY REPLIED
25 1907 876,445 ELECTROLYTE FOR ALKALINE STORAGE BATTERIES MAY 8 1907 914,343 MAKING STORAGE BATTERY ELECTRODES
BUT THE OTHER OPERATOR WOULD NOT PERMIT IT AND THE STRUGGLE CONTINUED FOR TEN MINUTES
AS THEY WERE FILED IN THE PATENT OFFICE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THE POSSIBILITY OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY WAS SUSPECTED IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE OF INTEREST TO GIVE THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT THEREFROM
I KEPT AT IT FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES LONGER AND NOTIFIED THEM THAT THERE WAS STILL NO ANSWER FROM LOUISVILLE
IN ADDITION THERE WAS A TRANSMITTING DEVICE IN THE SHAPE OF A MUSICAL REED OR BUZZER
IT IS HARD TO DETERMINE WHERE TO BEGIN WITH EDISON'S MISCELLANEOUS INVENTIONS BUT PERHAPS TELEGRAPHY HAS THE RIGHT OF LINE AND EDISON'S WORK IN THAT FIELD PUTS HIM ABREAST OF THE LATEST WIRELESS DEVELOPMENTS THAT FILL THE WORLD WITH WONDER
I SAID TO CHINNOCK

HIS WAS THE CREDIT OF FIRST ACTUALLY CARRYING PASSENGERS--TWO AT A TIME OVER A ROUGH PLANK ROAD--WHILE IT IS SAID THAT HIS WAS THE FIRST MOTOR TO BE TRIED ON REAL TRACKS THOSE OF THE EDINBURGH-GLASGOW ROAD MAKING A SPEED OF FOUR MILES AN HOUR
ONE DAY AS A JOKE I FILLED THREE OR FOUR SHEETS OF FOOLSCAP PAPER WITH A JUMBLE OF FIGURES AND TOLD BERGMANN THEY WERE CALCULATIONS SHOWING THE GREAT LOSS OF POWER FROM BLOWING THE FACTORY WHISTLE
I REMEMBER THE BEST EXPLANATION I GOT WAS FROM AN OLD SCOTCH LINE REPAIRER EMPLOYED BY THE MONTREAL TELEGRAPH COMPANY WHICH OPERATED THE RAILROAD WIRES
IT IS A GIGANTIC TREE-GRASS OR REED GROWING IN CLUMPS OF FROM ONE TO TWO HUNDRED OFTEN TWELVE INCHES IN DIAMETER AND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET HIGH AND KNOWN AS THE GIANT BAMBOO BAMBUSA GIGANTIA THIS GIANT GRASS STOOD THE HIGHEST TEST AS A CARBON AND ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EXTRAORDINARY SIZE AND QUALITIES I EXTEND IT THIS SPECIAL MENTION
PERHAPS HYPNOTISM WOULD ACCOUNT FOR IT
AT THE PRESENT TIME THE STUDIOS IN WHICH MOTION PICTURES ARE TAKEN ARE EXPENSIVE AND PRETENTIOUS AFFAIRS
MRS-TANNIE EDISON BAILEY THE SISTER HAD ON THE OTHER HAND A GREAT DEAL OF LITERARY ABILITY AND SPENT MUCH OF HER TIME IN WRITING
THE SYSTEM AS SHOWN IN THE SKETCH AND ELUCIDATED BY THE TEXT REPRESENTS THE OPERATION OF TRAIN TELEGRAPHY IN A SIMPLE FORM BUT COMBINING THE MAIN ESSENTIALS OF THE ART AS IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY AND COMMERCIALLY PRACTICED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AFTER EDISON AND GILLILAND ENTERED THE FIELD
IN JOURNALISM THERE HAVE BEEN LEADERS LIKE EDWARD ROSEWATER FOUNDER OF THE OMAHA BEE
A SKETCH WAS MADE AND THE PIECE-WORK PRICE $18 WAS MARKED ON THE SKETCH
14 1873 160,403 SOLUTIONS FOR CHEMICAL TELEGRAPH PAPEROCT
THE NEXT YEAR THEY COST US ABOUT SEVENTY CENTS AND WE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY
HE PARTIALLY PROMISED BUT NEVER TOOK TIME TO ATTEND TO IT
THE FIRST SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO SECURE AN ILLUSION OF MOTION BY PHOTOGRAPHY WAS MADE IN 1878 BY EDWARD MUYBRIDGE AS A RESULT OF A WAGER WITH THE LATE SENATOR LELAND STANFORD THE CALIFORNIA PIONEER AND HORSE-LOVER WHO HAD ASSERTED CONTRARY TO THE USUAL BELIEF THAT A TROTTING-HORSE AT ONE POINT IN ITS GAIT LEFT THE GROUND ENTIRELY
IT IS A HUMAN IMPOSSIBILITY NO MATTER HOW ABLE AND FAIR-MINDED THE JUDGE MAY BE
I ALWAYS WISHED I COULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD SIEMENS'S EXPLANATIONS OF THE POINTS OF THOSE STORIES
APRIL 27 1903 754,756 PROCESS OF TREATING ORES FROM MAGNETIC GANGUE MAY 25 1903 775,600 ROTARY CEMENT KILNS
IT IS TOO BAD THE MONEY IS GONE BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO
THE WELL-KNOWN PAGE PATENT WHICH HAD LINGERED IN THE PATENT OFFICE FOR YEARS HAD JUST BEEN ISSUED AND WAS CONSIDERED A FORMIDABLE WEAPON
HE TAKES GREAT DELIGHT IN IMITATING THE LINGO OF THE NEW YORK STREET GAMIN
I HAD THE FACULTY OF SLEEPING IN A CHAIR ANY TIME FOR A FEW MINUTES AT A TIME
I CLEARED OUT THE BUILDING ENTIRELY TO THE WALLS AND BUILT MY STATION OF STRUCTURAL IRONWORK RUNNING IT UP HIGH INTO THIS CONVERTED STRUCTURE WAS PUT THE MOST COMPLETE STEAM PLANT OBTAINABLE TOGETHER WITH ALL THE MECHANICAL AND ENGINEERING ADJUNCTS BEARING UPON ECONOMICAL AND SUCCESSFUL OPERATION
ONE DAY THE DAY OPERATOR WANTED TO GET OFF AND I WAS ON DUTY
HE WAS A QUEER KIND OF FELLOW
THE GRAND TRUNK RAILROAD MACHINE-SHOPS AT PORT HURON WERE A GREAT ATTRACTION TO THE BOY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF HIS TIME THERE
ONE ENGINE WOULD STOP AND THE OTHER WOULD RUN UP TO ABOUT A THOUSAND REVOLUTIONS AND THEN THEY WOULD SEE-SAW
HENCE HE TOOK THE COURSE WHICH ONE WOULD EXPECT OF EDISON'S COMMON SENSE AND DIRECTNESS OF ACTION
SOMEWHAT WEARY OF ALL THIS WORK AND EXCITEMENT AND NOT HAVING ENJOYED ANY CESSATION FROM TOIL OR PERIOD OF REST FOR TEN YEARS EDISON JUMPED EAGERLY AT THE OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED HIM IN THE SUMMER OF 1878 OF MAKING A WESTWARD TRIP
THE SCALES ARE SET ACCORDING TO THE CHEMIST'S WEIGHING ORDERS AND THE MATERIAL IS FED INTO THE SCALES FROM THE HOPPERS
THEN EDISON CAN SHOW WHAT IT IS FOR A STRONG MAN TO GET DOWNRIGHT MAD
THE MEN OUTSIDE KNEW WE WERE IN THERE AND THEY HAD A GREAT TIME DIGGING US OUT AND GETTING AIR TO US SUCH INCIDENTS BROUGHT OUT IN NARRATION THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE MEN WORKING WITH HIM HAD BEEN LESS FORTUNATE PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAD EXPERIMENTED WITH THE ROENTGEN X-RAY WHOSE RAVAGES LIKE THOSE OF LEPROSY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MUTILATION AND DEATH OF AT LEAST ONE EXPERT ASSISTANT
BUT WHEN THE OPERATOR TOOK THE $800 AND THEN SENT THE MESSAGE DEADHEAD HE COULDN'T STAND IT AND HE WOULD NEVER RELENT A THIRD TYPICAL STORY OF THIS PERIOD DEALS WITH A CIPHER MESSAGE FOR THOMAS
EDISON ARRIVED AT RIDGEWAY AT 8.30 P.M WHEN IT WAS RAINING AND AS DARK AS INK
ON THIS SAME FLOOR IS THE VACUUM-PUMP ROOM WITH A GLASS-BLOWERS ROOM ADJOINING BOTH OF THEM HISTORIC BY REASON OF THE STRENUOUS WORK DONE ON INCANDESCENT LAMPS AND X-RAY TUBES WITHIN THEIR WALLS
IN EDISON'S BOYISH DAYS IT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT AND TELEGRAPHIC SUPPLIES WERE HARD TO OBTAIN
EACH TIME I WOULD RETURN TO THE PLANT WITH THE DETERMINATION TO INCREASE THE OUTPUT IF POSSIBLE AND WE DID INCREASE IT TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THEN TO EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY BARRELS
I LEARNED AFTERWARD THAT HE GOT SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON WHILE THE HORSE-THIEF WAS HANGED
THE OTHER SURFACE CONSISTED OF A SMALL PAD WHICH RESTED WITH FRICTIONAL PRESSURE ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE DRUM
200,251
NOT ONLY THIS BUT EACH CAR BECOMES AN INDEPENDENTLY MOVING UNIT NOT SUBJECT TO DELAY BY REASON OF A GENERAL BREAKDOWN OF THE POWER PLANT OR OF THE LINE

ANOTHER AND SECOND CHARACTERISTIC OF EDISON'S PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTING SO STRONGLY TO HIS ACHIEVEMENTS IS AN INTENSE NOT TO SAY COURAGEOUS OPTIMISM IN WHICH NO THOUGHT OF FAILURE CAN ENTER AN OPTIMISM BORN OF SELF-CONFIDENCE AND BECOMING--AFTER FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE MORE AND MORE A SENSE OF CERTAINTY IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SUCCESS
LONG EXPERIENCE PROVED THAT THERE WERE GREAT DRAWBACKS FOUND GENERALLY BEFORE THEY COULD BE GOT COMMERCIAL
HE THOUGHT THE INTENSE COLD HAD CAUSED THEM TO HIBERNATE
HE WAS CERTAINLY THE MOST PROFANE MAN WE EVER HAD AROUND THE LABORATORY
THE TAKING CAMERA MUST HAVE ITS PARTS ENCLOSED IN A LIGHT-TIGHT BOX BECAUSE OF THE UNDEVELOPED SENSITIZED FILM BUT THE PROJECTING KINETOSCOPE USING ONLY A FULLY DEVELOPED POSITIVE FILM MAY AND FOR PURPOSES OF CONVENIENT OPERATION MUST BE ACCESSIBLY OPEN
1 JOB AND A NO
I HOPE IT WILL NEVER REACH PAR TO WHICH LUGUBRIOUS EPISODE SO PROVOCATIVE OF CYNICISM EDISON ADDS
WITHIN A FEW MONTHS AFTER ESTABLISHING HIMSELF AT THE PRESENT LABORATORY IN 1887 EDISON ENTERED UPON ONE OF THOSE INTENSELY ACTIVE PERIODS OF WORK THAT HAVE BEEN SO CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS METHODS IN COMMERCIALIZING HIS OTHER INVENTIONS
IF THAT DID NOT HAPPEN AND IF THE BELT WAS MADE TAUT SUDDENLY THE ARMATURE BURNED OUT--WHICH IT DID WITH DISCONCERTING FREQUENCY
IF THE RADIATING SURFACE SHOULD BE REDUCED TO THREE-THIRTY-SECONDS OF AN INCH THE TEMPERATURE WOULD REACH 6400 DEGREES FAHR
WE ONLY TRANSMITTED ABOUT TWO AND ONE-HALF MILES THROUGH THE KITES
INCANDESCENT LAMPS AND THEIR MANUFACTURE....................149 DISTRIBUTING SYSTEMS AND THEIR CONTROL AND REGULATION
THE NEEDLE ON THE OTHER DIAPHRAGM SUBSEQUENTLY FOLLOWED THESE INDENTATIONS THUS REPRODUCING THE ORIGINAL SOUNDS
MR EDISON HAS NEVER BEEN GREATER THAN WHEN HE MET AND SOLVED THIS CRISIS
AT THAT TIME AND ALL THROUGH THE SUCCEEDING YEARS UNTIL ABOUT 1905 THERE WAS ONLY ONE TYPE THAT WAS RECOGNIZED AS COMMERCIALLY PRACTICABLE--NAMELY THAT KNOWN AS THE LEAD-SULPHURIC-ACID CELL CONSISTING OF LEAD PLATES IMMERSED IN AN ELECTROLYTE OF DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID
1 1889 406,576 PHONOGRAM BLANK
IN FURTHER ELUCIDATION OF THE DIAGRAM IT MAY BE CONSIDERED THAT THE MAINS ARE LAID IN THE STREET ALONG A CITY BLOCK MORE OR LESS DISTANT FROM THE STATION WHILE THE FEEDERS ARE CONNECTED AT ONE END WITH THE SOURCE OF ENERGY AT THE STATION THEIR OTHER EXTREMITIES BEING CONNECTED TO THE MAINS AT CENTRAL POINTS OF DISTRIBUTION
AMONG THE FINANCIAL MEN WHOSE CLOSE PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP EDISON ENJOYED I WOULD MENTION HENRY VILLARD WHO I THINK HAD A HIGHER APPRECIATION OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE EDISON SYSTEM THAN PROBABLY ANY OTHER MAN OF HIS TIME IN WALL STREET
AND THE WHOLE STUDY OF THE THEATRICAL MANAGERS THUS REACHING THE MASSES IS NOT TO ASCERTAIN THE LIMITATIONS OF THE NEW ART BUT TO DISCOVER ITS BOUNDLESS POSSIBILITIES
BUT AMONG THE OTHERS THERE IS ONE WHICH IS WORTHY OF SPECIAL MENTION IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRESENT CONSIDERATION OF A COMPLETE SYSTEM
AS PUBLIC OPINION CAN BE BEST ILLUSTRATED BY ACTUAL QUOTATION WE SHALL PRESENT A CHARACTERISTIC INSTANCE
DETERIORATION THROUGH SULPHATION IF DISCHARGE IS CONTINUED TOO FAR OR IF RECHARGING IS NOT COMMENCED QUICKLY ENOUGH
HE THEN PUT UP A LITTLE TELEGRAPH LINE FROM THE STATION TO THE VILLAGE A DISTANCE OF ABOUT A MILE AND OPENED AN OFFICE IN A DRUG STORE
HE WALKED OVER TO ME AND SAID
FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THIS EPISODE THE MODERN LEAD-LEAD TYPE OF BATTERY THUS BROUGHT FORWARD WITH SO GREAT A FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS HAD A HARD TIME OF IT
AN ENGLISHMAN NAMED GEORGE LITTLE HAD BROUGHT OVER A SYSTEM OF AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHY WHICH WORKED WELL ON A SHORT LINE BUT WAS A FAILURE WHEN PUT UPON THE LONGER CIRCUITS FOR WHICH AUTOMATIC METHODS ARE BEST ADAPTED
SOON AFTER I HAD GOT OUT THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT I HAD AN INTERFERENCE IN THE PATENT OFFICE WITH A MAN FROM WISCONSIN
HE WAS VERY FOND OF TELLING AND HEARING STORIES AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED A JOKE
3 1900 660,845 APPARATUS FOR SAMPLING AVERAGING MIXING AND STORING MATERIALS IN BULK JAN
I STARTED IN AND SOON PRODUCED THE CARBON TRANSMITTER WHICH IS NOW UNIVERSALLY USED
THE CURRENT PASSED FROM THE MAIN LINE THROUGH THE PEN TO THE CHALK AND TO THE BATTERY
3 KNOWN AS THE TREE SYSTEM AND WAS IN FACT THE SYSTEM USED BY EDISON IN THE FIRST AND FAMOUS EXHIBITION OF HIS ELECTRIC LIGHT AT MENLO PARK AROUND THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD OF 1879
HE SAID HE HAD TAKEN IT FOR YEARS AND IT REQUIRED A BIG DOSE TO HAVE ANY EFFECT
BUT A FEW WORDS FROM MR EDISON BROUGHT IT BACK TO HIS REMEMBRANCE AND HE REPORTED THAT THE RESULTS HAD JUSTIFIED MR EDISON'S EXPECTATIONS IT MIGHT BE EXPECTED THAT EDISON WOULD HAVE EXTREME AND EVEN RADICAL IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT OF EDUCATION--AND HE HAS AS WELL AS A PERFECT READINESS TO EXPRESS THEM BECAUSE HE CONSIDERS THAT TIME IS WASTED ON THINGS THAT ARE NOT ESSENTIAL
BUT AT THAT TIME 1882 THE BULLETIN OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY PUBLISHED IN ORDINARY 12MO FORM WAS DISTINCTLY NEW IN ADVERTISING AND POSSIBLY UNIQUE AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND ANYTHING THAT COMPARED WITH IT
AT OTHER TIMES MY ENGAGEMENTS USED TO BE WITH HIM TO GO OVER HIS BUSINESS AFFAIRS AT MENLO PARK AT NIGHT IF I WAS OCCUPIED IN NEW YORK DURING THE DAY
JOHNSON WAS KEPT BUSY NOT ONLY WITH THE CARES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS PIONEER ENGLISH PLANT BUT BY NEGOTIATIONS AS TO COMPANY FORMATIONS HEARINGS BEFORE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES AND PARTICULARLY BY DISTINGUISHED VISITORS INCLUDING ALL THE FOREMOST SCIENTIFIC MEN IN ENGLAND AND A GREAT MANY WELL-KNOWN MEMBERS OF THE PEERAGE
THEY RECOGNIZED THE SCIENTIFIC POSSIBILITY OF THE PROBLEM BUT THEY WERE IRRETRIEVABLY HANDICAPPED BY THE SHORTCOMINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY
THUS BROADLY THE MANUFACTURING END OF THE PROBLEM OF INTRODUCTION WAS CARED FOR
HIS EYES WERE NEARLY WHITE AND APPEARED AS IF MADE OF GLASS AND SET IN WRONG LIKE THE LIFE-SIZE FIGURES OF INDIANS IN THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED OF THE BEST OPERATORS IN THE COUNTRY WERE AT THE FRONT ON THE FEDERAL SIDE ALONE AND SEVERAL HUNDRED MORE HAD ENLISTED
IT WAS A QUESTION OF KEEPING SUCH VISITORS AWAY RATHER THAN OF INVITING THEM TO TAKE UP THE EXPLOITATION OF THE EDISON SYSTEM
4 1878 218,167 ELECTRIC LIGHTS
EVEN IN AMERICA WHERE THE ADOPTION OF IMPROVEMENTS AND INNOVATIONS IS REGARDED AS SO PROMPT AND SURE AND WHERE THE HUGE TOLLS OF THE PATENT OFFICE AND THE COURTS BEAR WITNESS TO THE CEASELESS EFFORTS OF THE INVENTOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY THE SAD TRUTH THAT UNCONSCIOUSLY SOCIETY DISCOURAGES INVENTION RATHER THAN INVITES IT
HE GOT A MAP AND HAD AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF STATISTICS
PLANTS AT SANTIAGO CHILI AND RIO DE JANEIRO
HENCE THE QUICKEST WAY WAS TO SEARCH THE TROPICS UNTIL THE PROPER MATERIAL WAS FOUND
EDISON'S INEXHAUSTIBLE RESOURCEFULNESS AND FERTILITY OF IDEAS HAVE CONTRIBUTED LARGELY TO HIS GREAT SUCCESS AND HAVE EVER BEEN A CAUSE OF AMAZEMENT TO THOSE AROUND HIM
SO IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE CURRENT DOES NOT HAVE TO PENETRATE VERY FAR INTO THE NICKEL HYDRATE--ONE-HALF A LAYER'S THICKNESS BEING THE MAXIMUM DISTANCE
COPPER WIRE BE WOUND ON THE LOWER LEG OF THE MOTOR FIELD-MAGNET
THE WEIGHT PRESSES THE STYLUS TO ITS WORK BUT BECAUSE OF ITS MASS IT CANNOT RESPOND TO THE EXTREMELY RAPID VIBRATIONS OF THE STYLUS
WITH HIS WONTED ACTIVITY AND FERTILITY EDISON SET ABOUT DEVISING SUCH A CONTACT AND EXPERIMENTED WITH METAL WHEELS UNDER ALL CONDITIONS OF SPEED AND TRACK CONDITIONS
BUT THE LAYING OF THE CONDUCTORS WAS RESUMED PROMPTLY IN THE SPRING OF 1882
UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF 1882 THERE WERE ONLY A FEW ARC-LIGHTING STATIONS IN EXISTENCE FOR THE LIMITED DISTRIBUTION OF CURRENT
AN ENGINE OPERATED BY STEAM PRODUCED BY THE HYDRATION AND DEHYDRATION OF METALLIC SALTS
BUT IT WAS FOUND THAT THE LEASES WERE SELDOM RENEWED
AND GUIDED BY SKILFUL EXPERTS WHO MAY SUGGEST REALLY TRIVIAL CHANGES HERE AND THERE OVER THE PATENTED STRUCTURE AND WITH THE AID OF KEEN AND ABLE COUNSEL HARDLY A PATENT EXISTS THAT COULD NOT BE INVADED BY SUCH INFRINGERS
BUT THEIR THEORETIC SIGNIFICANCE HAD NOT BEEN PERCEIVED AND THEY WERE SOMEWHAT SCEPTICALLY REGARDED DURING THE SAME DISCUSSION IN LONDON IN 1889 SIR WILLIAM THOMSON LORD KELVIN AFTER CITING SOME EXPERIMENTS BY FARADAY WITH HIS INSULATED CAGE AT THE ROYAL INSTITUTION SAID
INVENTION DOES NOT SMOOTH THE WAY FOR THE PRACTICAL MEN AND MAKE THEM POSSIBLE
12,192 DESCRIBES THE FILM
WITH THE AID OF MR E
HAVING ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATED THE PRACTICABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF HIS PLANS HE WILL ALLOW RESPONSIBLE CONCERNS TO CARRY THEM INTO PRACTICE UNDER SUCH LIMITATIONS AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN THE BASIC OBJECT BUT WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT TO HIM EXCEPT FOR THE ACTUAL EXPENSE INCURRED

YOUNG ALVA OR AL AS HE WAS CALLED THUS EARLY DISPLAYED HIS GREAT PASSION FOR CHEMISTRY AND IN THE CELLAR OF THE HOUSE HE COLLECTED NO FEWER THAN TWO HUNDRED BOTTLES GLEANED IN BASKETS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE TOWN
THE TOWN WAS DRAPED IN FLAGS MOST PROFUSELY AND CARPETS WERE LAID ON THE CROSS-WALKS FOR THE PRINCE TO WALK ON
AS TO THE SIGNING OF A CERTAIN DOCUMENT AND SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT FOR ME TO SIGN
I VENTURED TO SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS AND HE SAID FIX IT
THEY OUGHT TO HELP YOU FOR IT WILL HELP US OUT
SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OR NIGHTS EDISON SAYS
IN THE EVENING I WENT OVER TO AN ALL-NIGHT LUNCH-HOUSE IN PRINTING HOUSE SQUARE IN A BASEMENT--OLIVER'S
JOHNSON HAD ALREADY BEEN SENT TO ENGLAND IN THE EDISON INTERESTS AND NOW THE QUESTION AROSE AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE FRENCH DEMANDS AND THE PARIS ELECTRICAL EXPOSITION WHOSE IMPORTANCE AS A POINT OF NEW DEPARTURE IN ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY WAS SPEEDILY RECOGNIZED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC
6 1890 444,530 LEADING-IN WIRES FOR INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS REISSUED OCTOBER 10 1905 NO
THE VOLTAGE WAS INCREASED TO A HIGHER PRESSURE THAN USUAL AND ALL THE INCANDESCENT LAMPS AT MENLO PARK DID THEIR BEST TO WIN THE APPROBATION OF THE NEW YORK CITY FATHERS
ANDREWS W
IT MAY BE DEFERRED TRUTH BUT IT IS THE TRUTH HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THAT VARIOUS REASONS CONSPIRED TO CAUSE THE DEPARTURE FROM MENLO PARK MIDWAY IN THE EIGHTIES
AND NOW HAVING OUTLINED A DEFINITE PATH EDISON WAS ALL AFIRE TO PUSH AHEAD VIGOROUSLY IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT ENTER IN AND POSSESS THE LAND
THIS INNATE MODESTY HOWEVER DOES NOT PREVENT EDISON FROM RECOGNIZING AND CLASSIFYING HIS OWN METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
I READ ALL THE TIME ON ASTRONOMY CHEMISTRY BIOLOGY PHYSICS MUSIC METAPHYSICS MECHANICS AND OTHER BRANCHES--POLITICAL ECONOMY ELECTRICITY AND IN FACT ALL THINGS THAT ARE MAKING FOR PROGRESS IN THE WORLD
THE PRINCIPAL OR TEST SUIT ON THE FILAMENT PATENT WAS THAT BROUGHT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ELECTRIC LIGHTING COMPANY WHICH BECAME A CAUSE CELEBRE IN THE ANNALS OF AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE
THE GREAT DEFECT OF THAT INSTRUMENT WAS THE RENDERING OF THE OVERTONES IN MUSIC AND THE HISSING CONSONANTS IN SPEECH
AS TO THE ADDITIONAL REFERENCE LETTERS I IS A CONDENSER J THE SOURCE OF LIGHT AND K A REFLECTOR
FEW OF THESE DATA WERE EVER ACTUALLY USED HOWEVER
THE ESSENTIAL TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THIS BATTERY ARE FULLY DESCRIBED IN AN ARTICLE WRITTEN BY ONE OF EDISON'S LABORATORY STAFF WALTER E
MANY UNKIND THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID OF MR EDISON AND HIS PROMISES
NO ONE CAN SAY EXACTLY JUST HOW THIS PROCESS OF DISINTEGRATION BEGAN BUT MR E
IN PARTICULAR IT IS DESIRED TO ACKNOWLEDGE INDEBTEDNESS TO MR W
HE AWOKE AT ONCE SMILING JUMPED UP WAS INSTANTLY HIMSELF AS USUAL AND ADVANCED AND GREETED THE VISITOR
IT WORKED ONLY A FEW MINUTES WHEN IT BUSTED
SOME YEARS AGO I HEARD ONE DAY THAT DOWN AT QUOGUE LONG ISLAND THERE WERE IMMENSE DEPOSITS OF BLACK MAGNETIC SAND
NO SUCH VICARIOUS TREATMENT WOULD SUIT HIM READY AS HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO SHARE THE WORK WHERE HE COULD GIVE HIS TRUST
AT LAST WHEN I SENT MEN OUT HUNTING FOR BAMBOO I DISPATCHED SEGREDOR TO CUBA
YOUNG EDISON WAITED AROUND THE SPOT FOR HALF AN HOUR OR MORE AND THEN AS IT WAS GROWING DARK WENT HOME PUZZLED AND LONELY BUT SILENT AS TO THE OCCURRENCE
THE HONOR OF THE FIRST ATTEMPT OF ANY KIND APPEARS TO REST WITH THIS COUNTRY AND WITH THOMAS DAVENPORT A SELF-TRAINED BLACKSMITH OF BRANDON VERMONT WHO MADE A SMALL MODEL OF A CIRCULAR ELECTRIC RAILWAY AND CARS IN 1834 AND EXHIBITED IT THE FOLLOWING YEAR IN SPRINGFIELD BOSTON AND OTHER CITIES
CONTINUOUS TESTS OF THE COMMERCIAL CELLS WERE CARRIED ON AT THE LABORATORY AS WELL AS MORE PRACTICAL AND HEAVY TESTS IN AUTOMOBILES WHICH WERE CONSTANTLY KEPT RUNNING AROUND THE ADJOINING COUNTRY OVER ALL KINDS OF ROADS
IT WAS MADE IN PURSUANCE OF HIS INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE SUBJECT OF HARMONIC TELEGRAPHS
TO HIM THEREFORE BE THE GLORY IF NOT THE PROFIT THE FOREGOING REMARKS OF MAJOR EATON SHOW AUTHORITATIVELY HOW THE MUCH-DISCUSSED DELAY IN LITIGATING THE EDISON PATENTS WAS SO GREATLY MISUNDERSTOOD AT THE TIME AND ALSO HOW IMPERATIVELY NECESSARY IT WAS FOR EDISON AND HIS ASSOCIATES TO DEVOTE THEIR ENTIRE TIME AND ENERGIES TO THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ART
12 1882 274,293 ELECTRIC LAMP
I SOON SAW THAT I WAS MISTAKEN
CUTTING OF NEW YORK BROUGHT HER OUT TO SEE THE LIGHT
IF THIS UTTER DETACHMENT FROM ANY LOVE OF MONEY FOR ITS OWN SAKE HAS NOT ALREADY BEEN ILLUSTRATED IN SOME OF THE INCIDENTS NARRATED ONE OR TWO STORIES ARE AVAILABLE TO EMPHASIZE THE POINT
SOME YEARS AGO AS ITS INSTALLATION WAS NEARING COMPLETION HE WENT UP TO LOOK IT OVER AND SATISFY HIMSELF AS TO WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE
INTERESTING AS THEY ARE HOWEVER WE SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THEM IN DETAIL AS THE SPACE REQUIRED WOULD BE TOO GREAT
IT WAS A TIME OF UNINTERRUPTED WATCHFULNESS
ONE OF THE ELECTRODES IS CONNECTED WITH THE DIAPHRAGM ON WHICH THE SOUND-WAVES IMPINGE AND THE VIBRATION OF THIS DIAPHRAGM CAUSES THE PRESSURE BETWEEN THE ELECTRODES TO BE CORRESPONDINGLY VARIED AND THEREBY EFFECTS A VARIATION IN THE CURRENT RESULTING IN THE PRODUCTION OF IMPULSES WHICH ACTUATE THE RECEIVING MAGNET
BUT FINDING NOTHING OF SUPERIOR QUALITY IN ALL THIS NORTHERN REGION I RETURNED TO CALCUTTA AND SAILED THENCE TO RANGOON IN BURMAH
I WORKED ON IT TILL THE MACHINE GAVE FAIR RESULTS
HE HAD THEN AS NOW THE KEEN ENJOYMENT OF A JOKE AND NO PARTICULAR AVERSION TO THE PRACTICAL FORM
OF COURSE THE NIGHTS WERE GETTING LONGER
IF THEIR SNORING BECAME OBJECTIONABLE TO THOSE STILL AT WORK THE CALMER WAS APPLIED
ALL RIGHT I WILL GIVE YOU $60 PER WEEK TO RUN BOTH SHIFTS HE WENT AT IT

HE HAD IMPROVED HIS OWN DIPLEX COMBINED IT WITH THE STEARNS DUPLEX AND THEREBY PRODUCED A SYSTEM BY MEANS OF WHICH FOUR MESSAGES COULD BE SENT OVER A SINGLE LINE AT THE SAME TIME TWO IN EACH DIRECTION
A YEAR LATER MR HARRISON WROTE WITH SOME PRIDE
THE LAMPS ARE 110 VOLTS
HE TOOK NO PRIDE IN BUILDING UP AN ENTERPRISE
TO ADVANCE ALONG SMOOTH AND PLEASANT PATHS TO ENCOUNTER NO OBSTACLES TO WRESTLE WITH NO DIFFICULTIES AND HARDSHIPS--SUCH HAS ABSOLUTELY NO FASCINATION TO HIM
THE DEVICE WAS PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR USE IN DETECTING AND MEASURING INFINITESIMAL DEGREES OF TEMPERATURE HOWEVER REMOTE AND ITS CONCEPTION FOLLOWED EDISON'S RESEARCHES ON THE CARBON TELEPHONE TRANSMITTER
NATURE DID RESPOND TO HIS WHOLE-HEARTED APPEAL AND BY THE TIME THE HUNT WAS ENDED REVEALED A GOOD STORAGE BATTERY OF ENTIRELY NEW TYPE

12 1890 534 209 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP SEPT
AND HIS LAUGH WAS THE LOUDEST WHEN THE EDISON-MACKENZIE HAIR LAMPS WERE BROUGHT UP TO INCANDESCENCE--THEIR RICHNESS IN RED RAYS BEING SLYLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE NATURE OF THE FILAMENTARY MATERIAL
EDISON HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE A VAST NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS WITH CARBONIZED PAPER FOR VARIOUS ELECTRICAL PURPOSES WITH SUCH GOOD RESULTS THAT HE ONCE MORE TURNED TO IT AND NOW MADE FINE FILAMENT-LIKE LOOPS OF THIS MATERIAL WHICH WERE PUT INTO OTHER LAMPS
THE FUTILITY OF HOPING TO MAINTAIN A BURNER IN VACUO WITH ANY PERMANENCY HAD DISCOURAGED PRIOR INVENTORS AND MR EDISON IS ENTITLED TO THE CREDIT OF OBVIATING THE MECHANICAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH DISHEARTENED THEM
ANY ONE CAN REALIZE HOWEVER THAT IT DID NOT TAKE SO ACUTE AND INGENIOUS A MIND VERY LONG TO PUSH FORWARD TO THE TELEPHONE AS A DANGEROUS COMPETITOR WITH BELL WHO HAD ALSO LIKE EDISON BEEN WORKING ASSIDUOUSLY IN THE FIELD OF ACOUSTIC AND MULTIPLE TELEGRAPHS
AND HIS HAND WOULD BE AS STEADY AND HIS PATIENCE AS UNYIELDING AT THE END OF THOSE MANY HOURS AS IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING IN SPITE OF REPEATED FAILURES
12 1872 150,848 CHEMICAL OR AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHS DEC
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
MR JENKS RELATES ANOTHER HUMOROUS INCIDENT IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PLANT
EDISON'S PERSISTENCE IN REDUCING THE COST OF HIS OPERATIONS IS NOTEWORTHY IN CONNECTION WITH HIS SCREENING AND DRYING INVENTIONS IN WHICH THE UTMOST ADVANTAGE IS TAKEN OF THE LAW OF GRAVITATION
I SELDOM WENT TO DINNERS
BELL'S PATENT WAS NOT SUSTAINED BY THE COURTS
THE DATA AND PARTS SUCH AS MOTOR RHEOSTAT SWITCHES ETC WERE GIVEN TO ME AND MY WORK WAS TO DESIGN THE SUPPORTING FRAME AXLES COUNTERSHAFTS DRIVING MECHANISM SPEED CONTROL WHEELS AND BOXES CAB RUNNING BOARD PILOT OR COW-CATCHER BUFFERS AND EVEN SUPPORTS FOR THE HEADLIGHT
BUT WITHIN CITY LIMITS OVERHEAD WIRES WITH SUCH SPACE-CONSUMING POTENTIALS ARE AS FRAUGHT WITH MISCHIEVOUS PERIL TO THE PUBLIC AS THE DYNAMITE STORED BY A NONCHALANT CONTRACTOR IN THE CELLAR OF A SCHOOLHOUSE
EDISON'S WORK ON CONVEYORS DURING THE PERIOD OF HIS ORE-CONCENTRATING LABORS WAS DISTINCTIVELY ORIGINAL INGENIOUS AND FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE TIMES
AFTER THE CHARGING OPERATION IS CONCLUDED THE BATTERY IS READY FOR USE AND UPON ITS CIRCUIT BEING CLOSED THROUGH A TRANSLATING DEVICE SUCH AS A LAMP OR MOTOR A REVERSION DISCHARGE TAKES PLACE THE POSITIVE PLATE GIVING UP ITS OXYGEN AND THE NEGATIVE PLATE BEING OXIDIZED
I HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN GETTING SUBSCRIBERS HAVING TRIED SEVERAL CANVASSERS WHO ONE AFTER THE OTHER FAILED TO GET SUBSCRIBERS
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF
ON EXAMINATION OF THE TWO PAPERS IT WAS FOUND THAT BOTH OF THEM COVERED PRACTICALLY THE SAME GROUND HENCE AS ONLY ONE PATENT COULD BE GRANTED IT BECAME NECESSARY TO ASCERTAIN THE PRECISE HOUR AT WHICH THE DOCUMENTS WERE RESPECTIVELY FILED AND PUT THE PARTIES IN INTERFERENCE
IF THE LATTER COURSE WAS PURSUED AND I WAS ADDRESSING A STRANGER I WOULD SIGN AS EDISON'S PRIVATE SECRETARY
IN LIKE MANNER EDISON WOULD MAKE FREE USE OF THE WATCHMAKER'S TOOLS THAT LAY ON THE LITTLE TABLE IN THE FRONT WINDOW AND WOULD TAKE THE WIRE PLIERS THERE WITHOUT MUCH THOUGHT AS TO THEIR VALUE AS DISTINGUISHED FROM A LINEMAN'S TOOLS
THE AMOUNT THUS DUE FROM THE CUSTOMER IS ASCERTAINED BY REMOVING THE CELL WASHING AND DRYING THE PLATES AND WEIGHING THEM IN A CHEMICAL BALANCE
IT WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE FROM A COMMERCIAL STANDPOINT TO OBTAIN A MUSICAL RECORD FROM A HIGH-CLASS ARTIST AND SELL SUCH AN ORIGINAL TO THE PUBLIC AS ITS COST MIGHT BE FROM ONE HUNDRED TO SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS
FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCREASED LUCIDITY WE WILL FIRST SHOW A PLAIN MULTIPLE-SERIES SYSTEM
THE OBJECT PRIMARILY SOUGHT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED WAS THE REPEATING OF TELEGRAPHIC SIGNALS FROM A DISTANCE WITHOUT THE AID OF A GALVANOMETER OR AN ELECTROMAGNETIC RELAY TO OVERCOME THE CLAIMS OF THE PAGE PATENT REFERRED TO IN THE PRECEDING NARRATIVE
THE CORPORAL WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN I CAME INTO THE CELLAR AND COULDN'T SEE HOW I COULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT AND WANTED TO KNOW FROM MY FATHER IF THERE WAS NO SECRET HIDING-PLACE
SO FAR AS FOUNDRY IRON IS CONCERNED THE EXPERIENCE AT CATASAUQUA PENNSYLVANIA BRIEF AS IT HAS BEEN SHOWS THAT A STRONGER AND TOUGHER METAL IS MADE EDISON HIMSELF TELLS AN INTERESTING LITTLE STORY IN THIS CONNECTION WHEN HE ENJOYED THE ACTIVE HELP OF THAT NOBLE CHARACTER JOHN FRITZ THE DISTINGUISHED INVENTOR AND PIONEER OF THE MODERN STEEL INDUSTRY IN AMERICA
AFTER A LITTLE THOUGHT HE CONCEIVED THE NICKEL-IRON IDEA AND STARTED TO WORK AT ONCE WITH CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY
HE ARRANGED IN THE CELLAR WHAT HE CALLED HIS RAT PARALYZER A VERY SIMPLE CONTRIVANCE CONSISTING OF TWO PLATES INSULATED FROM EACH OTHER AND CONNECTED WITH THE MAIN BATTERY
WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE HAD CLEARED SUFFICIENTLY TO SEE HE WENT AROUND AND PULLED EVERY TABLE AWAY FROM THE WALL PILING THEM ON TOP OF THE STOVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
THEY CAME TO 65 IN THE AFTERNOON AND LINCOLN COMMENCED TELLING STORIES--LIKE HIS FATHER
MAKE ME AN OFFER AGAIN HE NAMED $100,000
ABOUT THIS TIME EDISON HAD A NARROW ESCAPE FROM INJURY THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SHORTENED HIS CAREER AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE PROVOKED THE TROUBLE MORE OR LESS INNOCENTLY BY USING A LITTLE ELEMENTARY CHEMISTRY
THE REMAINING SHELVES OF THE FIRST GALLERY ARE FILLED WITH CURRENT NUMBERS AND SOME BACK NUMBERS OF THE NUMEROUS PERIODICALS TO WHICH EDISON SUBSCRIBES
BUT THE VARIATIONS IN STRENGTH HAVE NO EFFECT UPON THE DISTANT POLAR RELAY BECAUSE THAT RELAY BEING RESPONSIVE TO CHANGES IN POLARITY OF A WEAK CURRENT IS OBVIOUSLY RESPONSIVE TO CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN POLARITY OF A POWERFUL CURRENT

IT WAS ALSO IN EDISON'S STOCK PRINTER THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF SHIFTING TYPE-WHEELS WAS FIRST EMPLOYED
THE OPINIONS OF SCIENTIFIC MEN OF THE PERIOD ON THE SUBJECT ARE WELL REPRESENTED BY THE TWO FOLLOWING EXTRACTS--THE FIRST FROM A LECTURE AT THE ROYAL UNITED SERVICE INSTITUTION ABOUT FEBRUARY 1879 BY MR SIR W

THEN I REPRODUCED IT SO THAT IT COULD BE HEARD ALL OVER THE ROOM

THE NEXT DAY ECKERT SENT FOR ME AND I WAS TAKEN UP TO GOULD'S HOUSE WHICH WAS NEAR THE WINDSOR HOTEL FIFTH AVENUE
A MAN WOULD BE SENT TO EACH TO FIND OUT THE TROUBLE
AND WE WERE NOTIFIED TO CUT THE CURRENT OFF
I CAN SCARCELY CONCEIVE IT AS POSSIBLE THAT THE ARTICLE ON THE ABOVE SUBJECT EDISON'S ELECTRIC GENERATOR IN LAST WEEK'S SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN FROM STATEMENTS DERIVED FROM MR EDISON HIMSELF INASMUCH AS SO MANY OF THE ADVANTAGES CLAIMED FOR THE MACHINE DESCRIBED AND STATEMENTS OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED ARE SO MANIFESTLY ABSURD AS TO INDICATE ON THE PART OF BOTH WRITER AND PROMPTER A POSITIVE WANT OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT AND THE PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF ELECTRIC MACHINES
NO MEN IN THE WORLD HAVE MORE NEW INVENTIONS BROUGHT TO THEM THAN RAILROAD MANAGERS AND THIS WAS THE RANKEST KIND OF NOVELTY
ONE OF THE INNUMERABLE CONTACT SPRINGS HAD BROKEN OFF AND HAD FALLEN DOWN BETWEEN THE TWO GEAR WHEELS AND STOPPED THE INSTRUMENT
ALMOST ALL THE ELECTRICAL ARTS NOW EMPLOYED MADE THEIR BEGINNINGS IN THE NEXT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AND WHILE THE MORE EXTENSIVE OF THEM DEPEND TO-DAY ON THE DYNAMO FOR ELECTRICAL ENERGY SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STILL REMAIN IN LOYAL ALLEGIANCE TO THE OLDER SOURCE
ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS ACHIEVED BUT MODERATE SUCCESS AND WHEN IN 1879 THE NEW EDISON INCANDESCENT CARBON LAMP WAS ANNOUNCED MANY OF THE SCIENTISTS AND I PARTICULARLY DOUBTED THE ACCURACY OF THE REPORTS WHICH CAME FROM AMERICA

HE IS ENTIRELY SENSIBLE OF THE ADVANTAGES ARISING FROM A GOOD BALANCE AT THE BANKER'S BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE GOAL OF HIS AMBITION
AND IT WAS PROBABLY BETTER FOR HIMSELF EVEN IF HE DIED A GAUGER
IT IS YOURS ON ONE CONDITION AND THAT IS THAT YOU DO NOT PAY IT ALL AT ONCE BUT PAY ME AT THE RATE OF $6000 PER YEAR FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS'--THE LIFE OF THE PATENT
HE WENT BACK TO THE WORKS AND WAITED UNTIL SIX WHEN THE DAY MEN CAME AND TELEGRAPHED FOR A CARRIAGE
I PUT UP A SMALL PLANT BUT JUST AS I GOT IT STARTED A TREMENDOUS STORM CAME UP AND EVERY BIT OF THAT BLACK SAND WENT OUT TO SEA
HE WAS A MOST INTELLIGENT PATIENT COMPETENT AND LOYAL ASSISTANT TO MR EDISON
IT WAS AT THIS PERIOD THAT HIS REAL WORK ON STOCK PRINTERS COMMENCED FIRST INDIVIDUALLY AND LATER AS A CO-WORKER WITH F
AS THIS LAST-NAMED OPERATION PRECEDES THE CRUSHING LET US FIRST CONSIDER IT AS IT WAS PROJECTED AND CARRIED ON BY HIM
IT MUST BE HARD ENOUGH TO BEAR TRANSPORTATION AND TO CARRY THE FURNACE BURDEN WITHOUT CRUMBLING TO PIECES
A SMALL COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION WAS FORMED TO BUILD AND EXPLOIT THE APPARATUS AND THE SHOPS AT MENLO PARK LABORATORY WERE ASSISTED BY THE LITTLE BERGMANN SHOP IN NEW YORK
I MARRIED YOUR SISTER IT IS NOT TO BE INFERRED HOWEVER FROM SOME OF THE PRECEDING STATEMENTS THAT THE BOY WAS OF AN EXCLUSIVELY STUDIOUS BENT OF MIND
TABLE WITH CURVES SHOWING INCREASED ECONOMY BY LARGER ENGINE HIGHER POWER ETC
MR BATCHELOR WAS ALWAYS READY FOR ANY SPECIAL FINE EXPERIMENTING OR OBSERVATION AND COULD HOLD TO WHATEVER HE WAS AT AS LONG AS MR EDISON WISHED
HE EXPERIMENTED WITH BUNDLES OF IRON WIRES VARIOUSLY INSULATED ALSO WITH SHEET-IRON ROLLED CYLINDRICALLY AND COVERED WITH IRON WIRE WOUND CONCENTRICALLY
THE ILLUSTRATION OPPOSITE PAGE 454 OF THE PRECEDING NARRATIVE SHOWS THE FIRST EDISON LOCOMOTIVE AND TRAIN OF 1880 AT MENLO PARK
THE COURTS FIND NOTHING MORE DIFFICULT THAN TO APPLY AN ABSTRACT PRINCIPLE TO ALL CLASSES OF CASES THAT MAY ARISE
ALSO MINERALS IN GREAT ASSORTMENT
IN CONCLUSION ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT IF MR EDISON THINKS HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH BY THE REDUCTION OF THE INTERNAL RESISTANCE OF HIS MACHINE THAT HE HAS MUCH MORE TO DO IN THIS DIRECTION BEFORE HIS MACHINE WILL EQUAL IN THIS RESPECT OTHERS ALREADY IN THE MARKET ANOTHER PARTICIPANT IN THE CONTROVERSY ON EDISON'S GENERATOR WAS A SCIENTIFIC GENTLEMAN WHO IN A LONG ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN IN NOVEMBER 1879 GRAVELY UNDERTOOK TO INSTRUCT EDISON IN THE A B C OF ELECTRICAL PRINCIPLES AND THEN PROCEEDED TO DEMONSTRATE MATHEMATICALLY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DOING WHAT EDISON HAD ACTUALLY DONE
DETECTIVES WERE PUT ON THE CASE AND WE FOUND HE WAS A FAKER AND WE TOOK MEANS TO BREAK THE THING UP
FOR THIS WITNESS IS A VERY WISE AND LEARNED MAN IN THESE THINGS AND VERY POSITIVE
WE WILL GIVE THE WORKINGMAN AND HIS FAMILY ORNAMENTATION IN THEIR HOUSE
LONG BEFORE ATTAINING THE GOAL HE HAD REALIZED WITH CHARACTERISTIC INSIGHT THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF THE GREAT AND COMPREHENSIVE PROBLEM HE HAD STARTED OUT TO SOLVE AND PLODDED STEADILY ALONG THE PATH THAT HE HAD MARKED OUT IGNORING THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL SCIENTIFIC DISBELIEF IN HIS ULTIMATE SUCCESS
THERE WERE NO FLOURISHES BUT THE INDIVIDUAL LETTERS WOULD NOT BEAR CLOSE INSPECTION
4 SHOWING A LARGE BOULDER BEING DUMPED INTO THE HOPPER OR ROLL-PIT WILL SERVE TO ILLUSTRATE THE METHOD OF FEEDING THESE GREAT MASSES OF ROCK TO THE ROLLS AND WILL ALSO ENABLE THE READER TO FORM AN IDEA OF THE RAPIDITY OF THE BREAKING OPERATION WHEN IT IS STATED THAT A BOULDER OF THE SIZE REPRESENTED WOULD BE REDUCED BY THE GIANT ROLLS TO PIECES A TRIFLE LARGER THAN A MAN'S HEAD IN A FEW SECONDS
WE TRIED HIM THREE NIGHTS
AND TO CLOSE VERY DEFINITELY THAT CHAPTER OF HIS LIFE LEAVING HIM FREE TO DEVELOP OTHER IDEAS AND INTERESTS AS SET FORTH IN THESE VOLUMES
THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF SUCH MULTIPLE TRANSMISSION--NAMELY THE SIMULTANEOUS DISPATCH OF THE TWO COMMUNICATIONS IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS OVER THE SAME WIRE OR THE DISPATCH OF BOTH AT ONCE IN THE SAME DIRECTION--GAVE PLENTY OF PLAY TO INGENUITY

WHEN THIS PATENT AFTER PROTRACTED FIGHTING WAS SUSTAINED BY JUDGE GREEN IN 1893 THE ELECTRICAL ENGINEER REMARKED THAT THE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY MUST CERTAINLY FEEL ELATED BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE
AS I HAD NO INTENTION OF OFFERING TO SELL ANYTHING I WAS SHOWING AND WAS PUSHING NO COMPANIES THE WHOLE EXHIBITION WAS MADE FOR HONOR AND WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF PROFIT
BEFORE THE END OF DECEMBER OF THE SAME YEAR THE LIGHT HAD SO GROWN IN FAVOR THAT IT WAS BEING SUPPLIED TO OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY CUSTOMERS WHOSE BUILDINGS WERE WIRED FOR OVER FIVE THOUSAND LAMPS
IN THIS CONNECTION LET ME SAY THAT VERY MANY TIMES I HAVE HEARD MR EDISON MAKE PREDICTIONS AS TO WHAT A CERTAIN MECHANICAL DEVICE OUGHT TO DO IN THE WAY OF OUTPUT AND COSTS WHEN HIS STATEMENTS DID NOT SEEM TO BE EVEN AMONG THE POSSIBILITIES
THE PROCESS CONSISTS IN PLACING IN A VACUUM TWO LEAVES OR ELECTRODES OF GOLD AND BETWEEN THEM THE ORIGINAL RECORD
I HAD READ IN A SCIENTIFIC PAPER THE METHOD OF MAKING NITROGLYCERINE AND WAS SO FIRED BY THE WONDERFUL PROPERTIES IT WAS SAID TO POSSESS THAT I DETERMINED TO MAKE SOME OF THE COMPOUND
THE FIRST YEAR THE LAMPS COST US ABOUT $1.10 EACH
9 1900 679,500 APPARATUS FOR SCREENING FINE MATERIALS JAN
DURING PART OF THE LAST DECADE THERE WAS A LULL CAUSED MOSTLY FROM THE FAILURE OF CORPORATE INTERESTS TO CARRY OUT THEIR CONTRACT RELATIONS WITH EDISON AND HE WAS THEREBY COMPELLED TO RESORT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AT THE END OF WHICH HE BOUGHT IN THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS AND ASSUMED COMMAND OF THE BUSINESS PERSONALLY
JUNE 2 1881 263,150 MAGNETO OR DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINES
ASSUMING FOR INSTANCE THE BAR TO BE END-ON TOWARD THE OBSERVER THAT END WILL BE A SOUTH POLE IF THE CURRENT IS FLOWING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT CLOCKWISE AROUND THE BAR
THESE ROLLS WERE INTENDED FOR THE REDUCING OF ONE-MAN-SIZE ROCKS TO SMALL PIECES WHICH AT THE TIME OF THEIR ORIGINAL INCEPTION WAS ABOUT THE STANDARD SIZE OF SIMILAR MACHINES
I KNEW CHINNOCK TO BE SQUARE AND OF GOOD BUSINESS ABILITY AND INDUCED HIM TO LEAVE HIS JOB
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WE HAD TO HAVE A FACTORY FOR MANUFACTURING LAMPS
EDISON NATURALLY MET MANY OF THE CELEBRITIES OF FRANCE
BUT GRAY WAS EMBITTERED AND CHAGRINED AND TO THE LAST EXPRESSED HIS BELIEF THAT THE HONOR AND GLORY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIS
IN THIS FIELD OF TELEGRAPH APPLICATION AS IN OTHERS EDISON WAS A VERY EARLY COMER HIS ONLY PREDECESSOR BEING THE FERTILE AND INGENIOUS CALLAHAN OF STOCK-TICKER FAME
4 1908 896,812 STORAGE BATTERIES
TO OVERCOME THESE TROUBLES THE VERY INGENIOUS SUGGESTION WAS THEN MADE AND ADOPTED OF CONNECTING THE RECORDING AND REPRODUCING STYLUSES TO THEIR RESPECTIVE DIAPHRAGMS THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF A COMPENSATING WEIGHT WHICH ACTED PRACTICALLY AS A FIXED SUPPORT UNDER THE VERY RAPID SOUND VIBRATIONS BUT WHICH YIELDED READILY TO DISTORTIONS OR VARIATIONS IN THE WAX-LIKE CYLINDERS
NO HERO OF MYTHOLOGY OR FABLE EVER DARED SUCH DRAGONS TO RESCUE SOME CAPTIVE GODDESS AS DID THIS DAUNTLESS CHAMPION OF CIVILIZATION
DURING THE BOOM TIMES OF 1902 WHEN THE OLD GENERAL ELECTRIC STOCK SOLD AT ITS HIGH-WATER MARK OF ABOUT $330 MR EDISON AND I WERE ON OUR WAY FROM THE CEMENT PLANT AT NEW VILLAGE NEW JERSEY TO HIS HOME AT ORANGE
ONE NIGHT AT 2 A.M
THE MIDDLE AND TOP ROLLS WERE FREE TO MOVE UP OR DOWN FROM AND TOWARD THE LOWER ROLL AND THE SHAFTS OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER ROLLS WERE SET IN A LOOSE BEARING WHICH COULD SLIP UP AND DOWN IN THE IRON FRAME
THE MIDDLE AND TOP ROLLS WERE FREE TO MOVE UP OR DOWN FROM AND TOWARD THE LOWER ROLL AND THE SHAFTS OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER ROLLS WERE SET IN A LOOSE BEARING WHICH COULD SLIP UP AND DOWN IN THE IRON FRAME
AFTER THAT THE RAILROAD COMPANY BEGAN TO ADVERTISE THESE EXCURSIONS AND THE RECEIPTS EACH YEAR PAID FOR THE OBSERVATORY
THIS HISTORIC PLANT WAS HURRIEDLY THROWN TOGETHER ON CROWN LAND AND WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BEEN THE NUCLEUS OF A GREAT SYSTEM BUT FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE ENGLISH ELECTRIC LIGHTING ACT OF 1882 WHICH AT ONCE THROTTLED THE INDUSTRY BY ITS ABSURD RESTRICTIVE PROVISIONS AND WHICH THOUGH GREATLY MODIFIED HAS LEFT ENGLAND EVER SINCE IN A CONDITION OF SERIOUS INFERIORITY AS TO DEVELOPMENT IN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER
HE HAD MADE PREVIOUSLY SOME TRIALS OF PLATINUM WIRE AS AN INCANDESCENT BURNER FOR A LAMP BUT LEFT IT FOR A TIME IN FAVOR OF CARBON
JOHNSON AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE SYDENHAM VISITED BY THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF EDINBURGH TWICE BY THE DUKES OF WESTMINSTER AND SUTHERLAND BY THREE HUNDRED MEMBERS OF THE GAS INSTITUTE AND BY INNUMERABLE DELEGATIONS FROM CITIES BOROUGHS ETC
THE TERM STORAGE AS APPLIED TO THIS SPECIES OF BATTERY IS HOWEVER A MISNOMER AND HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF MUCH MISUNDERSTANDING TO NONTECHNICAL PERSONS
I GAVE NOTICE THAT I WOULD GIVE IT UP AT THE END OF THE MONTH PAID THE RENT MOVED OUT AND DELIVERED THE KEYS
SOME OF EDISON'S MOST REMARKABLE INVENTIONS ARE REVEALED IN A NUMBER OF INTERESTING PATENTS RELATING TO THE DUPLICATION OF PHONOGRAPH RECORDS
SITTING ON THE PORCH OF THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED DURING THAT PERIOD IN THE LIGHT OF THE SETTING SUN HIS FINE FACE IN REPOSE HE LOOKED AS PLACIDLY OVER THE SCENE AS A HAPPY FARMER OVER A FIELD OF RIPENING CORN
FOR THE CLAM CHOWDER THEY USED THE SAME FOUR CLAMS DURING THE WHOLE SEASON AND THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF FLIES PER PIE WAS SEVEN
ALL AGREED THAT IT MUST BE THE LITIGATION
THE USE OF THIS BAMBOO FOR EDISON LAMP FILAMENTS WAS CONTINUED FOR MANY YEARS
APRIL 26 1872 128,604 PRINTING TELEGRAPHS
AND THE VARIOUS MEANS OF ILLUSTRATING THE PHENOMENA OF SOUND TO THE EYE AND EAR PRIOR TO THE PHONOGRAPH WERE ALL INGENIOUS
IF ON THE CONTRARY THE INCOMING CURRENT ON THE MAIN LINE BE STRONG THE ARMATURE WILL BE STRONGLY ATTRACTED THE CARBON WILL BE SHARPLY COMPRESSED THE RESISTANCE IN THE LOCAL CIRCUIT WILL BE PROPORTIONATELY LOWERED AND THE SIGNAL HEARD ON THE LOCAL SOUNDER WILL BE A LOUD ONE
BEING SHARP CRYSTALLINE AND EVEN IN QUALITY IT WAS A VALUABLE BY-PRODUCT FINDING A READY SALE FOR BUILDING PURPOSES RAILWAY SAND-BOXES AND VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL USES
EDISON AND HIS CLOSEST ASSOCIATES WERE ACCUSTOMED TO CARRY THEIR LABORS FAR INTO THE WEE SMA HOURS AND WHEN PHYSICAL NATURE DEMANDED A RESPITE FROM WORK A SHORT REST WOULD BE OBTAINED BY GOING TO BED ON A COT
IT WAS THEN WEIGHED OUT INTO VERY SMALL PORTIONS WHICH WERE PRESSED INTO CAKES OR BUTTONS BY MEANS OF A HAND-PRESS
1 THE PERFORATOR
THESE EFFORTS RESULTED IN THE FIRM COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT OF MODERN ELECTRIC LIGHTING
WHEN BOEHM WAS IN GOOD-HUMOR HE WOULD PLAY HIS ZITHER NOW AND THEN AND AMUSE US BY SINGING PRETTY GERMAN SONGS
THIS RESULT IS PURELY PHYSIOLOGICAL AND IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE RETINA OF THE EYE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS PRACTICALLY A SENSITIZED PLATE OF RELATIVELY SLOW SPEED AND AN IMAGE IMPRESSED UPON IT REMAINS BEFORE BEING EFFACED FOR A PERIOD OF FROM ONE-TENTH TO ONE-SEVENTH OF A SECOND VARYING ACCORDING TO THE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT
THIS INSTRUMENT CAN ALSO BE USED TO INDICATE MINUTE CHANGES OF MOISTURE IN THE AIR BY SUBSTITUTING A STRIP OF GELATINE IN PLACE OF THE VULCANITE

I HAD PREPARED A LIST AND KNEW THE AMOUNT IN CASE THEY BIT AGAIN
AND IN 1909 IN SPITE OF ITS WEIGHT IT HAD FOUND ADOPTION IN OVER TEN THOUSAND AUTOMOBILES OF THE TRUCK DELIVERY WAGON PLEASURE CARRIAGE AND RUNABOUT TYPES IN AMERICA
FURTHERMORE THE FOIL COULD NOT BE EASILY REMOVED FROM AND REPLACED UPON THE INSTRUMENT AND CONSEQUENTLY THE REPRODUCTION HAD TO FOLLOW THE RECORDING IMMEDIATELY AND THE SUCCESSIVE TINFOILS WERE THROWN AWAY
THE NOTE-BOOKS CONTAIN HUNDREDS OF PAGES SHOWING THAT A GREAT MANY THOUSANDS OF EXPERIMENTS WERE TRIED AND PASSED UPON
IT HAD BEEN A SHARP STRUGGLE FOR BARE EXISTENCE DURING WHICH SUCH A MAN AS THE FOUNDER OF CORNELL UNIVERSITY HAD BEEN GLAD TO GET BREAKFAST IN NEW YORK WITH A QUARTER-DOLLAR PICKED UP ON BROADWAY
BUT ALL THIS EXTRA WORK REQUIRED ATTENTION AND EDISON SOLVED THE DIFFICULTY OF ATTENDING ALSO TO THE NEWSBOY BUSINESS BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF A YOUNG FRIEND WHOM HE TRAINED AND TREATED LIBERALLY AS AN UNDERSTUDY
17 1870 1871 113,034 PRINTING TELEGRAPH APPARATUS JAN
THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN
MR ANDREWS AND I WORKED IN COLLABORATION UNTIL THE NIGHT OF THE THIRD
THIS WAS FAITHFULLY DONE ALL THE CHANGES BEING MADE BEFORE THE PLANT WAS PUT INTO OPERATION
THE TWO HUNDRED AND ODD NOTE-BOOKS COVERING THE STRENUOUS PERIOD DURING WHICH EDISON WAS CARRYING ON HIS ELECTRIC-LIGHT EXPERIMENTS TELL ON THEIR FORTY THOUSAND PAGES OR MORE A FASCINATING STORY OF THE EVOLUTION OF A NEW ART IN ITS ENTIRETY
YOU SPEAK TO A JET OF VAPOR
A NOTABLE INSTANCE OF THE FLEECING OF UNSUSPECTING AND CREDULOUS PERSONS OCCURRED IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES DURING THE FUROR OCCASIONED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF MR EDISON'S ELECTRIC-LIGHT SYSTEM
THE NAME SUGGESTS THE USE OF THE TELEPHONE AND SUCH INDEED IS THE CASE
IT IS SAID THAT CARMAN THE FOREMAN OF THE MACHINE SHOP HAD GONE THE LENGTH OF WAGERING EDISON A BOX OF CIGARS THAT THE DEVICE WOULD NOT WORK

AND SINCE THEN THE WORKS HAVE BEEN GREATLY EXPANDED

HARD CUBAN ASPHALT AND SEPARATE ALL THE DIFFERENT HYDROCARBONS ETC AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BY MEANS OF SOLVENTS
BUT THE GROWING POPULARITY OF INCANDESCENT LIGHTING THE FLEXIBILITY AND SAFETY OF THE SYSTEM THE EASE WITH WHICH OTHER ELECTRIC DEVICES FOR HEAT POWER ETC COULD BE PUT INDISCRIMINATELY ON THE SAME CIRCUITS WITH THE LAMPS IN DUE COURSE RENDERED THE OLD ATTITUDE OF OPPOSITION OBVIOUSLY FOOLISH AND UNTENABLE
I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
EARLY IN 1881 MR GROSVENOR P
WE CARRIED ON THE EXPERIMENTS WITH THE TWO CHEMICALS TOGETHER
THE MERE FACT THAT ELECTRICAL ENERGY FROM THE LEAST EXPENSIVE CHEMICAL BATTERY USING UP ZINC AND ACIDS COSTS TWENTY TIMES AS MUCH AS THAT FROM A DYNAMO--DRIVEN BY STEAM-ENGINE--IS IN ITSELF ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN WHY SO MANY OF THE ELECTRIC ARTS LINGERED IN EMBRYO AFTER THEIR FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
AND THE GENERATING OF THE CURRENT THE REGULATION THE WIRING WITH DISTRIBUTING BOXES HOUSE CONNECTIONS METERS ETC ALL SHOWED SIGNS OF ASTONISHING SKILL AND INCOMPARABLE GENIUS SUCH PRAISE ON SUCH AN OCCASION FROM THE MAN WHO INTRODUCED INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTING INTO GERMANY IS SIGNIFICANT AS TO THE CONTINUED APPRECIATION ABROAD OF MR EDISON'S WORK
THE LONG CEMENT KILN IN THIS REMARKABLE INVENTION WHICH HAS BROUGHT ABOUT A STRIKING INNOVATION IN A LONG-ESTABLISHED BUSINESS WE SEE ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC INSTANCE OF EDISON'S INCISIVE REASONING AND BOLDNESS OF CONCEPTION CARRIED INTO PRACTICAL EFFECT IN FACE OF UNIVERSAL OPINIONS TO THE CONTRARY
SEVERAL OF THESE LUNCHES WERE HAD AT DELMONICO'S SHERRY'S AND OTHER PLACES OF SIMILAR CHARACTER BUT ONE DAY WHILE EN ROUTE MR EDISON SAID
BUT THE WATER DECOMPOSED AND THE INCURABLE DEFECT WAS STILL THERE
BUT THE NEW HOME WAS SITUATED IN GOOD FARMING COUNTRY AND ONCE AGAIN THIS INTERESTING NOMADIC FAMILY SETTLED DOWN
IN THE WAKE OF EVERY NEWLY DEVELOPED ART OF WORLD-WIDE IMPORTANCE THERE IS SURE TO FOLLOW A NUMBER OF UNSCRUPULOUS ADVENTURERS WHO HASTEN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GENERAL PUBLIC IGNORANCE OF THE TRUE INWARDNESS OF AFFAIRS
ITS NUMEROUS AND SOME OF THEM WONDERFULLY INGENIOUS METHODS PROCESSES MACHINES AND TOOLS SPECIALLY DESIGNED OR INVENTED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF SPECIAL PARTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL APPLIANCES FOR THE PHONOGRAPH OR OTHER EDISON PRODUCTS
A STARTLING MANIFESTATION OF THIS KIND HAPPENED AT SUNBURY WHEN THE VIVID DISPLAY DROVE NERVOUS GUESTS OF THE HOTEL OUT INTO THE STREET AND THE PROVIDENTIAL STORM LED MR LUTHER STIERINGER TO INVENT THE INSULATING JOINT THIS SEPARATED THE TWO LIGHTING SYSTEMS THOROUGHLY WENT INTO IMMEDIATE SERVICE AND IS UNIVERSALLY USED TO-DAY
MR EDISON CAN GUESS BETTER THAN A GOOD MANY MEN CAN FIGURE AND SO FAR AS MY EXPERIENCE GOES I HAVE FOUND THAT HE IS ALMOST INVARIABLY CORRECT
I NEVER GOT ANYTHING FOR IT
HIS IDEA OF COURSE WAS TO PUT THIS WIRE ACROSS THE ENDS OF THE SUPPLYING CIRCUITS AND SHORT-CIRCUIT THE WHOLE THING--PUT IT ALL OUT OF BUSINESS WITHOUT BEING DETECTED
HIS ENGINEERS HAD SPENT $20,000,000 TOO MUCH IN BUILDING THE ROAD AND IT WAS NOT HIS FAULT IF HE FOUND HIMSELF SHORT OF MONEY AND AT THAT TIME UNABLE TO RAISE ANY MORE VILLARD MAINTAINED HIS INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN ELECTRIC-RAILWAY DEVELOPMENT WITH REGARD TO WHICH EDISON REMARKS
NEVER MADE ANY MONEY
LONG ROWS OF SHELVES AND CABINETS FILLED WITH CHEMICALS LINE THE ROOM
THUS FAR WE HAVE REFERRED TO TWO SYSTEMS ONE THE NEUTRAL OR DIFFERENTIAL DUPLEX AND THE OTHER THE COMBINATION OF THE NEUTRAL AND POLAR RELAYS MAKING A DIPLEX SYSTEM
HE WAS FAR MORE MODEST THAN IN MY YOUTHFUL PICTURE OF HIM
THE FOLLOWING IS THE RECORD OF THE RESULTS
HE REACHED OVER TO THE KEY AND ANSWERED THE CALL
THE NEW YORK EDISON COMPANY OR THE CHICAGO EDISON COMPANY SHOULD HAVE AS MUCH CURRENT GOING OUT FOR STORAGE BATTERIES AS FOR POWER MOTORS
RATTLY
THIS WAS DONE IN A SPECIAL MACHINE OF EDISON'S INVENTION CALLED A PERFORATOR CONSISTING OF A SERIES OF PUNCHES OPERATED BY A BANK OF KEYS--TYPEWRITER FASHION
MORGAN CO
THE GOAL OF THE RURAL TELEGRAPH OPERATOR WAS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE PRESS
HOW NEAR DOES SHE FIT MIKE ABOUT AN INCH NAIL HER A MOST CASUAL EXAMINATION OF ANY OF THE LABORATORY RECORDS WILL REVEAL EVIDENCE OF THE MINUTEST EXACTITUDE INSISTED ON IN THE CONDUCT OF EXPERIMENTS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE LENGTH OF TIME THEY OCCUPIED
THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH FACILITIES IS TO BE ADMIRED RATHER THAN DEPLORED
I REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT IF I COULD RECORD THE MOVEMENTS OF THE DIAPHRAGM PROPERLY I COULD CAUSE SUCH RECORD TO REPRODUCE THE ORIGINAL MOVEMENTS IMPARTED TO THE DIAPHRAGM BY THE VOICE AND THUS SUCCEED IN RECORDING AND REPRODUCING THE HUMAN VOICE
NO ONE CAPABLE OF MAKING THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE FOR WHICH WE ARE INDEBTED TO MR EDISON COULD BE OTHER THAN AN ACCOMPLISHED ELECTRICIAN
SUBSEQUENTLY ONE OF THESE IDEAS WITH MODIFICATIONS SUGGESTED BY SOME OF THE OTHERS WAS PUT INTO SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE
WITH EDISON'S TELEPHONE THE SOUND-WAVES SIMPLY ACTUATE AN ELECTRIC VALVE SO TO SPEAK AND PERMIT VARIATIONS IN A CURRENT OF ANY DESIRED STRENGTH
HE SAID HE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY
ONE DAY HE AND I WERE IN THE CITY AND AS MRS EDISON HAD SPOKEN TO ME ABOUT IT AND AS WE HAPPENED TO HAVE AN HOUR TO SPARE I PERSUADED HIM TO GO TO AN OCULIST WITH ME

MR ANDREWS STAYED ON MR KRUESI'S STAFF AS LONG AS THE LABORATORY MACHINE-SHOP WAS KEPT OPEN AFTER WHICH HE WENT INTO THE EMPLOY OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY AND BECAME ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE COMMERCIAL AND TECHNICAL EXPLOITATION OF THE SYSTEM
FOOTNOTE 13
AND DID FINE WORK
GOLD FELL TO 132 AND IT TOOK US ALL NIGHT TO GET THE INDICATOR BACK TO THAT QUOTATION
THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF THIS INVENTION CAN BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED BY A BRIEF GLANCE AT THE STATE OF THE ART IN 1878-79 WHEN EDISON WAS CONDUCTING THE FINAL SERIES OF INVESTIGATIONS WHICH CULMINATED IN HIS INVENTION OF THE INCANDESCENT LAMP AND SYSTEM OF LIGHTING
AS FAR BACK AS 1837 THE AMERICAN PAGE DISCOVERED THE CURIOUS FACT THAT AN IRON BAR WHEN MAGNETIZED AND DEMAGNETIZED AT SHORT INTERVALS OF TIME EMITTED SOUNDS DUE TO THE MOLECULAR DISTURBANCES IN THE MASS
14 1872 126,533 PRINTING TELEGRAPHS
HE WAS JUST AS LIKELY TO BE AT WORK IN HIS LABORATORY AT MIDNIGHT AS MIDDAY
IN HIS TESTIMONY AND PUBLIC UTTERANCES EDISON HAS ALWAYS GIVEN BELL CREDIT FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THE TRANSMISSION OF ARTICULATE SPEECH BY TALKING AGAINST A DIAPHRAGM PLACED IN FRONT OF AN ELECTROMAGNET
TO PREVENT THESE ELECTROLYTES FROM FREEZING WE HAD IN EACH METER A STRIP OF METAL
THE NEWSPAPER MEN ALLOWED ME TO COME OVER AFTER GOING TO PRESS AT 3 A.M
I THANKED HIM SAYS EDISON AND HOPED TO RECIPROCATE SOMEHOW
HENCE IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT ON THE WHOLE THE EDISON LAMP LITIGATION WAS NOT LESS REMARKABLE FOR QUANTITY THAN QUALITY
EATON PRESIDENT VIEWED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF OVER TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS LATER THE WISDOM AND NECESSITY OF ANSWERING ANONYMOUS NEWSPAPER LETTERS OF THIS KIND MIGHT BE DEEMED QUESTIONABLE BUT IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT ALTHOUGH THE PEARL STREET STATION WAS WORKING SUCCESSFULLY AND EDISON'S COMPREHENSIVE PLANS WERE ABUNDANTLY VINDICATED THE ENTERPRISE WAS ABSOLUTELY NEW AND ONLY JUST STEPPING ON THE VERY THRESHOLD OF COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION
PREFERABLY OF COURSE SUNLIGHT IS USED WHENEVER POSSIBLE HENCE THE GLASS STUDIOS
AN IDEAL LOCATION FOR ANY CENTRAL STATION IS AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE DISTRICT SERVED
BUT IN THE EARLIER STAGES ONE WATCHED CHIEFLY THE CONFUSED VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE OF THE INDIVIDUAL PIONEERS
474,230 WAS GRANTED THEREON
EDISON ALL IT OWES TO HIM THE AGE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE AN ASSIGNMENT THE PRESENT CHAPTER WILL HAVE THROWN SOME LIGHT ON THE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF EDISON AS FINANCIER AND AS MANUFACTURER AND WILL HAVE SHOWN THAT WHILE THE CLAIM THUS SUGGESTED MAY BE QUITE GOOD IT WILL CERTAINLY NEVER BE PRESSED OR COLLECTED
THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF ELECTROMAGNETISM
IT WAS SHORT-LIVED
MEANTIME GREAT EXCITEMENT HAD BEEN CAUSED IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN EUROPE BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF EDISON'S SUCCESS
AND ITS PAGES SERVE NOW AS A VIVID AND LIVELY PICTURE OF THE PERIOD TO WHICH ITS RECORD APPLIES
THE DOOR OPENED AND IN CAME ABOUT TWENTY YOUNG LADIES ELEGANTLY GOWNED NOT ONE OF WHOM WAS UNDER SEVENTEEN
AS A RULE WE NEVER WAKE MR EDISON FROM SLEEP BUT AS HE WANTED TO SEE COLONEL BAILEY WHO HAD TO GO I FELT THAT AN EXCEPTION SHOULD BE MADE SO I WENT AND TAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER
UNTIL 6 A.M
WHILE PLANNING FOR MY FIRST NEW YORK STATION--PEARL STREET--OF COURSE I HAD NO REAL ESTATE AND FROM LACK OF EXPERIENCE HAD VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS COST IN NEW YORK
THE ARMATURE LEVER L IS LONG PIVOTED IN THE CENTRE AND IS BENT OVER AT THE END
FROM QUITO HE WENT TO GUAYAQUIL FROM THERE BY STEAMER TO BUENAVENTURA AND THENCE BY RAIL TWELVE MILES TO CORDOVA
IN THE CASE OF THE GAS COMPANIES AND THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT MANY OF THEM TO WHOM IT WAS IN THE EARLY DAYS AS GREAT AN IRRITANT AS A RED FLAG TO A BULL EMULATED THE PERFORMANCE OF THAT ANIMAL AND SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND ENERGY IN BELLOWING AND THROWING UP DIRT IN THE EFFORT TO DESTROY THE HATED ENEMY
ALL MAGNETS HAVE TWO POLES NORTH AND SOUTH
THE GENERAL OPERATION WAS SIMPLE AND IN NORMALLY ACTIVE TIMES THE MECHANISM AND THE REGISTRAR WERE EQUAL TO ALL EMERGENCIES
I PUT UP $800 AND WAS TO GET HALF OF THE PROFITS AND EACH OF THEM ONE-QUARTER
THE OTHER WHEELS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY SO EQUIPPED
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS THROUGH INTENSE HOSTILITY AND OPPOSITION THAT THE YOUNG ART MADE ITS WAY PUSHED FORWARD BY EDISON'S OWN STRONG PERSONALITY AND BY HIS UNBOUNDED UNWAVERING FAITH IN THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF HIS SYSTEM
LONDON ENGLAND AND A REPLY FROM HIM
SOME OF THE INFRINGING LAMP-MANUFACTURING CONCERNS WHICH DURING THE LONG LITIGATION HAD GROWN STRONG AND LUSTY AND THUS FAR HAD NOT BEEN ENJOINED BY THE COURT NOW SAW INJUNCTIONS STARING THEM IN THE FACE AND IN DESPERATION SET UP THE GOEBEL SO-CALLED ANTICIPATION AS A DEFENCE IN THE SUITS BROUGHT AGAINST THEM
AS A BODY THEY ARE FAIR ABLE AND HARD-WORKING
THIS CO-OPERATION IN NO SENSE RELIEVES THE AUTHORS OF RESPONSIBILITY AS TO ANY OF THE VIEWS OR STATEMENTS OF THEIR OWN THAT THE BOOK CONTAINS
A SERIOUS OCCURRENCE THAT MIGHT HAVE RESULTED IN ACCIDENT DROVE HIM SOON AFTER FROM CANADA ALTHOUGH THE YOUTH COULD HARDLY BE HELD TO BLAME FOR IT

SUCH WAS THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM THAT CONFRONTED EDISON AT THE OUTSET
I REPLIED THAT I WAS BORN AND BRED IN NEW YORK STATE BUT NOW THAT I HAD BECOME A JERSEY MAN I DID NOT VALUE MYSELF AT ABOVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
HOW I NEVER KNEW PERSONALLY
I WAS VERY MUCH WORRIED ABOUT THE WATER AND I KNEW THAT IF IT GOT LOW THE BOILER WAS LIKELY TO EXPLODE
WE HAD ONE OF THOSE CELEBRATED DINNERS THAT ONLY MR CHILDS COULD GIVE AND I HEARD SPEECHES FROM CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE
PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE VITAL INVENTIONS WERE DELIBERATELY APPROPRIATED BY OTHERS AND THE INVENTOR WAS LAUGHED AT FOR HIS PAINS
FOOTNOTE 28
BUT IT DOES NOT DESCRIBE ACCURATELY THE INVENTOR ASKING TO BE LET ALONE
THIS BELIEF WAS THE STRONGER BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES BELONGED PERSONALLY TO MR EDISON AND NOT TO HIS COMPANY
ARIZONA AND THAT MR EDISON WANTED TO SPEND THE EVENING DISCUSSING MATTERS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS EUROPEAN AFFAIRS
I ALSO ENGAGED IN PUTTING UP PRIVATE LINES UPON WHICH I USED AN ALPHABETICAL DIAL INSTRUMENT FOR TELEGRAPHING BETWEEN BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS A FORERUNNER OF MODERN TELEPHONY
THEY WERE NOT FULLY UP TO THE IDEAL THAT HE HAD IN MIND
IT IS SIGNIFICANT OF EDISON'S WORK NOW DIMMED AND OVERLAID BY LATER ADVANCES THAT AT THE VERY OUTSET HE RECOGNIZED THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF INTERCHANGEABILITY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS DELICATE AND SENSITIVE APPARATUS
HAD EDISON IN UPTON'S SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN ARTICLE IN 1879 PROPOSED SUCH AN EXCEEDINGLY LOW ARMATURE RESISTANCE FOR THIS IMMENSE GENERATOR ALTHOUGH ITS RATIO WAS PROPORTIONATE TO THE ORIGINAL MACHINE HIS CRITICS MIGHT PROBABLY HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY INDIGNANT AS TO BE UNABLE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES COHERENTLY THE STUDENT MAY FIND IT INTERESTING TO LOOK UP EDISON'S UNITED STATES PATENTS NOS
THE SYSTEM WAS SOLD TO A VERY WEALTHY MAN AND HE WOULD NEVER SELL ANY RIGHTS OR ANSWER LETTERS

THE ACT OF BREAKING AND CRUSHING WOULD NATURALLY DECREASE THE TREMENDOUS MOMENTUM BUT AFTER THE ROCK WAS REDUCED AND THE PIECES HAD PASSED THROUGH THE BELT WOULD AGAIN COME INTO PLAY AND ONCE MORE SPEED UP THE ROLLS FOR A REPETITION OF THEIR REGULAR PRIZE-FIGHTER DUTY
AS EARLY AS 1804 THE FIRST COMPANY EVER ORGANIZED FOR GAS LIGHTING WAS FORMED IN LONDON ONE SIDE OF PALL MALL BEING LIT UP BY THE ENTHUSIASTIC PIONEER WINSOR IN 1807
OBVIOUSLY AS THE CYLINDER WAS TURNED THE NEEDLE FOLLOWED A SPIRAL PATH WHOSE PITCH DEPENDED UPON THAT OF THE FEED SCREW
5 MEXICO 14 NATAL
DURING THE FIRST FEW YEARS IN WHICH THE BUSINESS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE LIGHT WAS CARRIED ON WITH SUCH STRENUOUS AND CONCENTRATED EFFORT THE ATTENTION OF EDISON AND HIS ORIGINAL ASSOCIATES WAS CONSTANTLY FOCUSED UPON THE COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION AND THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM AT HOME AND ABROAD
WE NOW TOOK THE WIRE FROM THE VIBRATOR IN ONE HAND AND STOOD ON A BLOCK OF PARAFFIN EIGHTEEN INCHES SQUARE AND SIX INCHES THICK
THE LARGEST OF THESE WORKS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THAT OF THE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AT SCHENECTADY NEW YORK A CONTINUATION AND ENORMOUS ENLARGEMENT OF THE SHOPS WHICH EDISON ESTABLISHED THERE IN 1886
A MARINE VIEW THE MOTION OF WAVES THE PASSAGE OF CLOUDS IN A STORMY SKY PARTICULARLY IN A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY THE ERUPTION OF A VOLCANO ETC
WITH UNEARTHLY HOWLS AND SHRIEKS A L'INDIEN HE PRANCED ABOUT THE ROOM INCIDENTALLY GIVING EDISON A SCARE THAT MADE HIM JUMP UP FROM HIS WORK
GOOD-BYE EDISON
THIS VIEW WOULD SEEM ENTIRELY JUSTIFIABLE WHEN WE CONSIDER THE WONDERFUL CHANGES IN THE CONDITIONS OF MODERN LIFE THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE WIDE-SPREAD EMPLOYMENT OF THESE INVENTIONS AND THE GIGANTIC INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE GROWN UP AND BEEN NOURISHED BY THEIR WORLD-WIDE APPLICATION

HE THUS SENT SEVERAL MESSAGES TO HIS FRIENDS AND WAS AFTERWARD SET FREE ANOTHER CURIOUS STORY TOLD BY EDISON CONCERNS A FELLOW-OPERATOR ON NIGHT DUTY AT CHATTANOOGA JUNCTION AT THE TIME HE WAS AT MEMPHIS

AND WENT OVER AND TOLD HIM I WANTED TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT AND GET SOME LOANS AND DISCOUNTS

ON THE OTHER HAND THIS MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF A SYSTEM OF CONDUCTORS SO DEVISED AND ARRANGED THAT WHILE THEY WOULD INSURE THE EQUAL PRESSURE THUS DEMANDED THEIR MASS AND CONSEQUENT COST WOULD NOT EXCEED THE BOUNDS OF PRACTICAL AND COMMERCIALLY ECONOMICAL INVESTMENT
HE WOULD TAKE A SHEET OF THIS PAPER WRITE CAPITAL A AND THEN TAKE ANOTHER SHEET AND MAKE THE A DIFFERENTLY
WE MUST RETURN TO THE DAYS OF 1878 WHEN EDISON WITH AT LEAST THREE FIRST-CLASS INVENTIONS TO HIS CREDIT--THE QUADRUPLEX THE CARBON TELEPHONE AND THE PHONOGRAPH--HAD BECOME A MAN OF MARK AND A WORLD CHARACTER THE INVENTION OF THE PHONOGRAPH WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED AS USUAL BY THE APPEARANCE OF SEVERAL OTHER INCIDENTAL AND AUXILIARY DEVICES SOME PATENTED AND OTHERS REMAINING SIMPLY THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF APPARATUS THAT HAD BEEN WORKED OUT
IN THE PUBLIC MIND HE IS CREDITED WITH THE INVENTION OF THE INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHT THE PHONOGRAPH AND OTHER WIDELY KNOWN DEVICES
THE NAME OF THIS VIOLATOR OF THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WAS THEREAFTER EXCLUDED STUDIOUSLY FROM THE COLUMNS OF PAUL PRY AND THE INCIDENT MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE WHICH SOON CAUSED THE ABANDONMENT OF THE PAPER

A PASSING GLANCE AT A FEW PAGES OF THESE WRITTEN RECORDS WILL SERVE TO ILLUSTRATE THOUGH ONLY TO A LIMITED EXTENT THE THOROUGHNESS OF EDISON'S METHOD

I WELL REMEMBER ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT GOING DOWN TO THE MENLO PARK DEPOT AND GETTING THE STATION AGENT WHO WAS ALSO THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR TO SEND SOME CABLE MESSAGES FOR ME TO MY LONDON FRIENDS ANNOUNCING THAT I HAD SEEN EDISON'S INCANDESCENT LIGHTING SYSTEM IN ACTUAL OPERATION AND THAT SO FAR AS I COULD TELL IT WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT
THUS HE WAS OBLIGED TO BEGIN AGAIN AT THE FOUNDATION AND HE DEVISED A CRUSHING-MACHINE WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY NAMED THE THREE-HIGH ROLLS AND WHICH PRACTICALLY REVERSED THE ABOVE FIGURES AS IT DEVELOPED 84 PER CENT
SO IT IS WITH THE TESTIMONY
THE FACES OF THESE ROLLS WERE SMOOTH BUT AS THREE-HIGH ROLLS CAME INTO USE LATER IN EDISON'S PORTLAND CEMENT OPERATIONS THE FACES WERE CORRUGATED SO AS TO FIT INTO EACH OTHER GEAR-FASHION TO PROVIDE FOR A HIGH RATE OF FEED THIS PRESSURE WAS APPLIED IN A MOST INGENIOUS MANNER
MR BATCHELOR WITH MESSRS
THESE CRUCIAL TESTS AIMING VIRTUALLY TO BREAK THE PLANT DOWN IF POSSIBLE WITHIN PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS LASTED SEVERAL WEEKS AND WHILE MOST VALUABLE IN THE INFORMATION THEY AFFORDED DID NOT HINDER ANYTHING FOR MEANTIME CUSTOMERS PREMISES THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WERE BEING WIRED AND SUPPLIED WITH LAMPS AND METERS
1 1879 1880 230,255 ELECTRIC LAMPS JAN
BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE RECORD HAD TO BE CARRIED AWAY TO THE BROKERS OFFICES AND OTHER PLACES BY MESSENGERS
I AM INFORMED THAT THIS IS THE SECRET OF THE FAILURE TO PRODUCE WITH THE POWER IN POSITION A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF CURRENT TO RUN ALL THE LAMPS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT UP AND THAT WHILE SIX AND EVEN SEVEN LIGHTS TO THE HORSE-POWER MAY BE PRODUCED FROM AN ISOLATED PLANT THE RESISTANCE OF THE LONG UNDERGROUND WIRES REDUCES THIS RESULT IN THE ABOVE CASE TO LESS THAN THREE LIGHTS TO THE HORSE-POWER THUS MAKING THE COST OF PRODUCTION GREATLY IN EXCESS OF GAS
I KNEW THEN THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO PUT UP A JOB ON ME BUT KEPT MY OWN COUNSEL
HIS EXPERIMENTS AND IDEAS ON MAGNETISM AT THAT PERIOD WERE FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE TIME
THE SECOND AND THIRD WENT TO LONDON WHERE THEY WERE INSTALLED IN 1881 BY MR JOHNSON AND HIS ASSISTANT MR W
IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THESE CONCEPTIONS WERE IN EDISON'S MIND AT AN EARLY PERIOD OF HIS INVESTIGATIONS WHEN THE BEST EXPERT OPINION WAS THAT THE SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT WAS AN IGNIS FATUUS
AFTER SELLING PAPERS IN PORT HURON WHICH WAS OFTEN NOT REACHED UNTIL ABOUT 9.30 AT NIGHT I SELDOM GOT HOME BEFORE 11.00 OR 11.30
AN INSISTENTLY EXPRESSED DESIRE ON THE PART OF THE PUBLIC FOR A DEFINITIVE BIOGRAPHY OF EDISON WAS THE REASON FOR THE FOLLOWING PAGES
TO ELUCIDATE THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF EDISON'S METHOD LET THE CRUSHED ORE FALL IN A THIN STREAM PAST SUCH A MAGNET
BUT ON THE CONTRARY THEY HAVE BEEN EVOLVED BY SLOW AND GRADUAL STEPS SO THAT FREQUENTLY THE FINAL ADVANCE HAS BEEN OFTEN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE
EVEN UNDER THE BEST CONDITIONS IT WAS FOUND THAT THE CARBON MEMBERS WERE SUBJECT TO A RAPID DISINTEGRATION OR EVAPORATION WHICH EXPERIMENTERS ASSUMED WAS DUE TO THE DISRUPTING ACTION OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT
SEEING ONLY THE GOAL OF A COMPLETE INVENTION OR PERFECTED DEVICE TO ATTAIN WHICH ALL ELSE MUST BECOME SUBSIDIARY
THERE WERE ONLY THREE OR FOUR COULD BEAT IT
EDISON'S BOLDNESS AND BREADTH OF CONCEPTION ARE WELL ILLUSTRATED IN HIS IDEA OF A POURED HOUSE IN WHICH HE DISPLAYS HIS ACCUSTOMED TENDENCY TO REVERSE ACCEPTED METHODS
TO REPRODUCE THIS RECORD IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY TO AGAIN START AT THE BEGINNING AND CAUSE THE NEEDLE TO RETRACE ITS PATH IN THE SPIRAL LINE
ONE OF THESE PARTS WAS CONVERTED FOR THE USES OF THE STATION PROPER AND THE OTHER WAS USED AS A TUBE-SHOP BY THE UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS FOR REPAIR-SHOPS STORAGE ETC
EDISON AND HIS ELECTRIC LIGHT WERE HAPPILY MORE FORTUNATE THAN OTHER MEN AND INVENTIONS IN THE RELATIVE CORDIALITY OF THE RECEPTION GIVEN THEM
FOUND AS USUAL HARD AT WORK--THIS TIME ON HIS CEMENT HOUSE OF WHICH HE SHOWED THE IRON MOLDS--EDISON TOOK OCCASION TO REMARK THAT IF HE HAD ACHIEVED ANYTHING WORTH WHILE IT WAS DUE TO THE OBSTINACY AND PERTINACITY HE HAD INHERITED FROM HIS FOREFATHERS
AS REGARDS OTHER PARTS OF THE EDISON SYSTEM NOTABLY THE EDISON DYNAMO NO SUCH MACHINES HAD EVER EXISTED
AND EVERYBODY LOST THEIR HEAD
THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE THE ARC LIGHT BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
BUT THE FRICTION GEARING WAS NOT EQUAL TO THE SUDDEN STRAIN PUT UPON IT DURING ONE RUN AND WENT TO PIECES
THE TWO BOYS WERE PICKED UP BY THE TRAIN-HANDS AND CARRIED TO THE PLATFORM AND THE GRATEFUL FATHER AT ONCE OFFERED TO TEACH THE RESCUER WHOM HE KNEW AND LIKED THE ART OF TRAIN TELEGRAPHY AND TO MAKE AN OPERATOR OF HIM
MY FACE AND BACK WERE STREAKED WITH YELLOW
THE CARBON WAS LIGHTED UP TO INCANDESCENCE AND OF COURSE OXIDIZED AND DISINTEGRATED IMMEDIATELY
20 1882 1883 278,415 MANUFACTURE OF INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
HE SUCCEEDED FINALLY AND WHEN IT GAVE WAY HE FELL WITH THE BOARD AND STRIKING ON A TABLE CUT HIMSELF SO THAT HE SOON BECAME COVERED WITH BLOOD
HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF CIGARS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
A BRILLIANTLY VICIOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS METHOD OF TREATMENT IS TO BE FOUND IN THE PARIS FIGARO OF THAT YEAR WHICH UNDER THE APPROPRIATE TITLE OF THIS ASTOUNDING EDDISON LAY BARE BEFORE THE FRENCH PUBLIC THE MOST STARTLING REVELATIONS AS TO THE INVENTOR'S LIFE AND CHARACTER
I THEN SHOUTED MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB ETC
AND IT LED TO HIS RESUMPTION OF WORK FOR THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY WHICH WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET HIM BACK
LET IT SUFFICE STATISTICAL RESUME APPROXIMATE OF SOME OF THE INDUSTRIES IN THE UNITED STATES DIRECTLY FOUNDED UPON OR AFFECTED BY INVENTIONS OF THOMAS A
OTHER NAMES OF A LESS COMPLIMENTARY NATURE WERE APPLIED TO HIM EVEN THOUGH HIS LAMP WERE ACTUALLY IN USE AND THE PRINCIPLE OF COMMERCIAL INCANDESCENT LIGHTING HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED
THE PRIMARY OF THE INDUCTION-COIL IS CONNECTED AS SHOWN ONE END GOING TO KEY K AND THE OTHER TO THE BUZZER CIRCUIT
THUS INDICATING THAT THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN WAS UNDERLAID WITH VAST BODIES OF MAGNETIC ORE
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LITERATURE AND RECORDS IN ALL PARTS OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD WERE SUBJECTED TO THE MOST MINUTE SCRUTINY OF OPPOSING EXPERTS IN THE ENDEAVOR TO PROVE EDISON TO BE MERELY AN ADAPTER OF METHODS AND DEVICES ALREADY PROJECTED OR SUGGESTED BY OTHERS
THEN MR ORTON SENT FOR ME
AS THE EDISON LIGHT COMPANY DID NOT SEEM DISPOSED TO GO INTO MANUFACTURING WE STARTED A SMALL LAMP FACTORY AT MENLO PARK WITH WHAT MONEY I COULD RAISE FROM MY OTHER INVENTIONS AND ROYALTIES AND SOME ASSISTANCE
AS HAS BEEN ALREADY INTIMATED ITS AUTHOR FOLLOWED A THOROUGH COURSE OF READING ON THE SUBJECT LONG BEFORE REACHING THE ACTUAL PROJECTION OR INSTALLATION OF A PLANT AND HE HAD FOUND ALL AUTHORITIES TO AGREE ON ONE IMPORTANT POINT--NAMELY THAT THE VALUE OF CEMENT DEPENDS UPON THE FINENESS TO WHICH IT IS GROUND
ALTHOUGH EDISON DID NOT FOLLOW UP THE IDEA AND TAKE OUT A PATENT THIS SYSTEM OF DISTILLATION WAS LATER HIT UPON BY OTHERS AND IS IN USE AT THE PRESENT TIME
AND TO GIVE SIMPLY THE NAMES OF PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WOULD FILL MANY PAGES OF THIS RECORD
IN HIS LABORATORY NOTE-BOOKS ARE INNUMERABLE JOTTINGS OF THE THINGS THAT WERE CARBONIZED AND TRIED SUCH AS TISSUE-PAPER SOFT PAPER ALL KINDS OF CARDBOARDS DRAWING-PAPER OF ALL GRADES PAPER SATURATED WITH TAR ALL KINDS OF THREADS FISH-LINE THREADS RUBBED WITH TARRED LAMPBLACK FINE THREADS PLAITED TOGETHER IN STRANDS COTTON SOAKED IN BOILING TAR LAMP-WICK TWINE TAR AND LAMPBLACK MIXED WITH A PROPORTION OF LIME VULCANIZED FIBRE CELLULOID BOXWOOD COCOANUT HAIR AND SHELL SPRUCE HICKORY BAYWOOD CEDAR AND MAPLE SHAVINGS ROSEWOOD PUNK CORK BAGGING FLAX AND A HOST OF OTHER THINGS
AFTER THIS DECISION WAS RENDERED THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY COMPANY REMAINED FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN A MORIBUND CONDITION AND ON THE LAST DAY OF 1896 ITS PROPERTY WAS PLACED IN THE HANDS OF A RECEIVER
AT THE TIME EDISON WAS BORN IN 1847 TELEGRAPHY UPON WHICH HE WAS TO LEAVE SO INDELIBLE AN IMPRINT HAD BARELY STRUGGLED INTO ACCEPTANCE BY THE PUBLIC
WHEN THE ELEVATED RAILROAD IN NEW YORK UP SIXTH AVENUE WAS STARTED THERE WAS A GREAT CLAMOR ABOUT THE NOISE AND INJUNCTIONS WERE THREATENED
THUS AN INFINITESIMAL VARIATION IN ITS LENGTH THROUGH EXPANSION OR CONTRACTION CHANGES THE PRESSURE ON THE CARBON AND AFFECTS THE RESISTANCE OF THE CIRCUIT TO A CORRESPONDING DEGREE THEREBY CAUSING A DEFLECTION OF THE GALVANOMETER
AS A MATTER OF FACT IN 1856 AND AGAIN IN 1875 GEORGE F
THIS WAS ABOUT A YEAR AFTER CALLAHAN STARTED IN NEW YORK TO SAY THE LEAST THIS EVIDENCED GREAT ABILITY AND ENTERPRISE ON THE PART OF THE YOUTH
HE REPLIED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT KEPT THE OUTPUT DOWN BUT HE WAS JUST AS CONFIDENT AS EVER THAT THE KILN WOULD MAKE ONE THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY AND THAT IF HE HAD TIME TO WORK WITH AND WATCH THE KILN IT WOULD NOT TAKE HIM LONG TO FIND OUT THE REASONS WHY
THE EXPIRATION OF THE LEADING BELL TELEPHONE PATENTS FIVE YEARS LATER ACCENTUATED EVEN MORE SHARPLY THE CHECK THAT HAD BEEN PUT ON TELEGRAPHY AS HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF INDEPENDENT TELEPHONE COMPANIES WERE THEN ORGANIZED THROWING A VAST NETWORK OF TOLL LINES OVER OHIO INDIANA ILLINOIS IOWA AND OTHER STATES AND AFFORDING CHEAP INSTANTANEOUS MEANS OF COMMUNICATION WITHOUT ANY NECESSITY FOR THE INTERVENTION OF AN OPERATOR
ONE WOULD NATURALLY THINK THAT THE WEAR AND TEAR OF THIS INTENSE APPLICATION DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WOULD HAVE TENDED TO INDUCE A HEAVINESS AND GRAVITY OF DEMEANOR IN THESE BUSY MEN
17 1883 281,351 ELECTRICAL GENERATOR MARCH 5 1883 283,984 SYSTEM OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION
BEING NOW READY FOR MANUFACTURING BUT REQUIRING MORE FACILITIES EDISON INCREASED HIS REAL-ESTATE HOLDINGS BY PURCHASING A LARGE TRACT OF LAND LYING CONTIGUOUS TO WHAT HE ALREADY OWNED
OF COURSE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND I MEANT WITHOUT OIL TO SAY I WAS DEEPLY PERPLEXED DOES NOT EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
THIS STRUCK ME AS ABNORMAL
NOTHING HAPPENED HOWEVER TO INTERFERE WITH THE SUCCESSFUL RUNNING OF THE STATION AND FOR TWENTY YEARS THEREAFTER THE SAME TWO DYNAMOS CONTINUED TO FURNISH LIGHT IN SUNBURY
THIS MACHINE WAS LAID ON ITS SIDE ITS ARMATURE BEING HORIZONTAL AND LOCATED TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE
THIS WAS FINALLY ACCOMPLISHED AND FURTHER INVENTION THEN PROCEEDED ALONG ENGINEERING LINES LOOKING TOWARD THE DEVISING OF A SYSTEM OF MOLDS WITH WHICH PRACTICABLE DWELLINGS MIGHT BE CAST
NOR DID THIS AMAZING EQUIPMENT STOP AT BATTERIES AND BOTTLES
EDISON HAD GREAT ZEST IN THIS WORK AND BUT FOR THE STRONG INFLUENCES IN OTHER DIRECTIONS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE CONTINUED IN THE NEWSPAPER FIELD IN WHICH HE WAS BEYOND QUESTION THE YOUNGEST PUBLISHER AND EDITOR OF THE DAY
NOW THERE WAS NO SUCH ORDER ABOUT PRIVATE MESSAGES AND THE JEW FINDING IT OUT COMPLAINED TO CAPTAIN VAN DUZER CHIEF OF TELEGRAPHS WHO INVESTIGATED THE MATTER AND WHILE HE WOULD NOT DISCHARGE THE OPERATOR LAID HIM OFF INDEFINITELY
THE ABOVE PRINCIPLES WERE EMPLOYED IN THE STEARNS DIFFERENTIAL DUPLEX SYSTEM IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
THIS LED TO THE DEMAND FOR A NICKEL-IN-THE-SLOT MACHINE WHICH WHEN ESTABLISHED BECAME IMMENSELY POPULAR OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY
ONE DAY ECKERT CALLED ME INTO HIS OFFICE AND MADE INQUIRIES ABOUT MONEY MATTERS
IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD ONCE BEEN A SLAVER
TO CARRY OUT THIS LAW TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE IN REGARD TO PLATINA ETC THEN WITH A GIVEN LENGTH OF WIRE TO QUADRUPLE THE HEAT WE MUST LESSEN THE RADIATING SURFACE TO ONE-QUARTER AND TO DO THIS IN A SPIRAL THREE-QUARTERS MUST BE WITHIN THE SPIRAL AND ONE-QUARTER OUTSIDE FOR RADIATING
THE TELEPHONE MOTOGRAPH AND MICROPHONE X
23 1880 239,149 INCANDESCING ELECTRIC LAMP DEC
THE OPERATOR THERE WHO WAS ALSO AGENT WHEN ASKED BY ME IF I COULD HAVE THE ELECTRODES OF EACH CELL MADE OF SHEET PLATINUM GAVE HIS PERMISSION READILY THINKING THEY WERE OF TIN
THUS COMPLETING WITHIN THE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS THE FULL LAY-OUT OF THE ENTIRE PLANT AS IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY INSTALLED AND AS IT HAS SUBSTANTIALLY REMAINED IN PRACTICAL USE TO THIS TIME
KNOWING SOMETHING OF THE INTRICACY OF THE PRACTICAL PROBLEM I SHOULD CERTAINLY PREFER SEEING IT IN EDISON'S HANDS TO HAVING IT IN MINE THE READER MAY HAVE DEEMED THIS SKETCH OF THE STATE OF THE ART TO BE A CONSIDERABLE DIGRESSION
IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THE POSITION WHICH EDISON OCCUPIES IN THE TELEPHONE ART FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT
BY MEANS OF THIS ADJUNCT THE DASHES AND DOTS OF THE TRANSMITTED IMPULSES COULD BE RECORDED UPON A PAPER RIBBON PASSING CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE DRUM
HE CONTINUED AT THIS TASK ALL THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT AND WORKED STEADILY ON UNTIL SUNDAY AFTERNOON WHEN HE COMPLETED A LIST OF NEARLY SIX HUNDRED ITEMS
INDEED THERE IS STILL TO-DAY CONSTANT WORK EXPENDED ON THEIR PERFECTION ALTHOUGH THEIR PRESENT GENERAL FORM WAS DECIDED UPON SEVERAL YEARS AGO
WE NOW TRIED ALL THE METALS TOUCHING EACH ONE IN TURN TO THE POINT X HERE FOLLOWS A LIST OF METALS AND THE CHARACTER OF SPARK OBTAINED WITH EACH BY INCREASING THE BATTERY FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE CELLS WE GET A SPARK WHEN THE VIBRATING MAGNET IS SHUNTED WITH 3 OHMS
SPEAKING OF THIS AND OF HIS OTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH INDUCTION TELEGRAPHY BY MEANS OF KITES COMMUNICATING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND THUS FROM THE KITES TO INSTRUMENTS ON THE EARTH EDISON SAID RECENTLY
I REPORTED TO MR EDISON ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN HE INSTRUCTED ME TO COME TO THE LABORATORY AT ONCE TO LEARN ALL THE DETAILS OF DRAWING AND CARBONIZING FIBRES WHICH IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO DO IN THE ORIENTAL JUNGLES
THE NOMADIC LIFE OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS DID NOT LESSEN HIS DEVOTION TO STUDY
ONE MORNING AS WE WERE HASTENING TO BREAKFAST WE CAME INTO TREMONT ROW AND SAW A LARGE CROWD IN FRONT OF TWO SMALL GENTS FURNISHING GOODS STORES
BESIDES THIS THE USE OF PLATES WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPRACTICABLE BECAUSE THE LIMITATIONS OF THEIR WEIGHT AND SIZE WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE TAKING OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PICTURES AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED EVEN IF THE SENSITIZED SURFACE HAD BEEN SUFFICIENTLY RAPID
BY DIGGING A CHEAP TRENCH AND PUTTING IN AN INSULATED CABLE AND CONNECTING SUCH STATION WITH THE CENTRAL PART OF RICHMOND HAVING THE END OF THE CABLE COME UP INTO THE STATION FROM THE EARTH AND THERE CONNECTED WITH MOTORS THE POWER OF THE FALLS WOULD BE TRANSMITTED TO THESE MOTORS
QUITE A DIFFERENT EXHIBITION WAS GIVEN TWO WEEKS LATER BY ANOTHER WELL-KNOWN ENGLISHMAN ALSO AN ELECTRICIAN WHO CAME IN WITH HIS FRIENDS AND I WAS TRYING FOR TWO HOURS TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIM AND FAILED AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT EDISON WAS MORE THAN EVER IN DEMAND SOCIALLY BUT HE SHUNNED FUNCTIONS LIKE THE PLAGUE NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH WORK BUT BECAUSE OF HIS DEAFNESS
THE NEXT AND LAST EXPLORER WHOM EDISON SENT OUT IN SEARCH OF NATURAL FIBRES WAS MR JAMES RICALTON OF MAPLEWOOD NEW JERSEY A SCHOOL-PRINCIPAL A WELL-KNOWN TRAVELLER AND AN ARDENT STUDENT OF NATURAL SCIENCE
HENCE THE PICTURES AND POSTAL CARDS SOLD LARGELY TO SOUVENIR-HUNTERS AS THE PORT HURON HOME DO NOT ACTUALLY SHOW THAT IN OR AROUND WHICH THE EVENTS NOW REFERRED TO TOOK PLACE
DURING THE DAY BUSINESS WAS CARRIED ON UNDER GREAT STRESS AND MR INSULL HAS DESCRIBED HOW EDISON WAS TO BE FOUND THERE TRYING TO LEAD THE LIFE OF A MAN OF AFFAIRS IN THE CONVENTIONAL GARB OF POLITE SOCIETY INSTEAD OF PURSUING INVENTIONS AND RESEARCHES IN HIS LABORATORY
CARBON CRUCIBLE KEPT BRILLIANTLY INCANDESCENT BY CURRENT IN VACUO FOR OBTAINING REACTION WITH REFRACTORY METALS
MANN MCNAILLIE ARCHITECTS NEW YORK HIS IDEA OF THE TYPE OF HOUSE HE WANTED
HE DESIRED NO FURTHER ASSURANCE IN THAT DIRECTION AND THEREUPON ORDERED A LETTER OF CREDIT MADE OUT WITH AUTHORIZATION TO ORDER A SECOND WHEN THE FIRST WAS EXHAUSTED
THIS LED TO THE CREATION OF A GOLD ROOM IN WALL STREET WHERE THE PRECIOUS METAL COULD BE DEALT IN
THIS ACCIDENT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS TAKING A VACATION IN GERMANY AND A PROMINENT SCIENTIFIC MAN CONNECTED WITH THE COMPANY CABLED MR EDISON TO KNOW WHETHER THE MACHINE WOULD WORK IF THE COIL WAS CUT OUT
IT MAY HERE BE NOTED FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE LAY READER THAT THE LEAD-ACID TYPE OF STORAGE BATTERY CONSISTS OF TWO OR MORE LEAD PLATES IMMERSED IN DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID AND CONTAINED IN A RECEPTACLE OF GLASS HARD RUBBER OR OTHER SPECIAL MATERIAL NOT ACTED UPON BY ACID
AFTER FISHING FOR SEVERAL HOURS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE BITE
ONE WOULD BE STARTLED TO SEE HIM WITH A BRIGHT TIE A LOUD CHECKED SUIT OR A FANCY WAISTCOAT AND YET THERE IS A CURIOUS SENSE OF FASTIDIOUSNESS ABOUT THE PLAIN THINGS HE DELIGHTS IN
ONE MORNING WHEN HE WAS FREE AS USUAL AT 3 O'CLOCK HE STARTED OFF AT A RAPID PACE WITH TEN VOLUMES ON HIS SHOULDER
HE SAID HE WANTED TO SELL THE ENERGY OUTSIDE OF THE STATION AND NOT WASTE IT IN THE DYNAMO AND CONDUCTORS WHERE IT BROUGHT NO PROFITS
THE MAIN CONDUCTORS ARE SUFFICIENTLY LARGE IN CROSS-SECTION TO OFFER BUT LITTLE RESISTANCE IN THOSE PARTS WHICH ARE COMPARATIVELY NEAR THE GENERATOR BUT AS THE CURRENT TRAVERSES THEIR EXTENDED LENGTH THERE IS A GRADUAL INCREASE OF RESISTANCE TO OVERCOME AND CONSEQUENTLY THE DROP INCREASES AS SHOWN BY THE FIGURES
IN THIS CASE THE BALANCE IS PRESERVED AND THE CENTRAL WIRE REMAINS NEUTRAL AS NO RETURN CURRENT FLOWS THROUGH IT TO THE SOURCE OF ENERGY

ALL SUCH LETTERS FINDING THEIR WAY PROMPTLY INTO THE PROPER CHANNELS OFTEN WITH A PITHY ENDORSEMENT BY EDISON SCRIBBLED ON THE MARGIN
WE HAD A SPECIAL CAR
THE LITTLE DUTCH BOY WITH THE HORSE MET ME AT THIS POINT
EDISON'S STUDY OF THE SUBJECT HAD LED HIM TO THE CONVICTION THAT THE GREATEST GROWTH OF THE ELECTRIC-LIGHTING INDUSTRY WOULD BE FAVORED BY A LAMP TAKING LESS CURRENT BUT HAVING SHORTER THOUGH COMMERCIALLY ECONOMICAL LIFE
WHEN AN ELECTRICAL IMPULSE CAME OVER THE LINE FROM THE TRANSMITTING END CURRENT PASSED THROUGH THE MOISTENED PAPER FROM THE IRON PIN CAUSING CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION BY REASON OF WHICH THE IRON WOULD BE ATTACKED AND WOULD MARK A LINE ON THE PAPER
AND THE JOURNAL EXPRESSED ITS FEAR THAT ALTHOUGH THE SPECIFICATIONS AND CLAIMS RELATED ONLY TO THE MAINTENANCE OF UNIFORM PRESSURE OF CURRENT ON LIGHTING CIRCUITS THE OWNERS MIGHT NATURALLY SEEK TO APPLY IT ALSO TO FEEDERS USED IN THE ELECTRIC-RAILWAY WORK ALREADY SO EXTENSIVE
ONE VISIT OF NOTE WAS THAT PAID BY LIEUT
EPISODES FULL OF HUMAN INTEREST ATTEND ITS DEVELOPMENT
IT WAS IN MANY WAYS AN IDEAL HOMESTEAD TOWARD WHICH THE FAMILY HAS ALWAYS FELT THE STRONGEST ATTACHMENT BUT THE ASSOCIATION WITH MILAN HAS NEVER WHOLLY CEASED
OF THESE LATTER THOMAS ALVA EDISON IS ONE BUT IN THE PAGES OF HISTORY HE STANDS CONSPICUOUSLY PRE-EMINENT--A COMMANDING TOWERING FIGURE EVEN AMONG GIANTS
THE CONTRACTION OF THE FROG'S LEGS MAY WITH CONSIDERABLE SAFETY BE SAID TO BE CAUSED BY THESE MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS BEING TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE CONDUCTING WIRES EDISON THOUGHT THAT THE LONGITUDINAL VIBRATIONS CAUSED BY THE SOUNDER PRODUCED A MORE MARKED EFFECT AND PROCEEDED TO TRY OUT HIS THEORY

OF THESE ONE FURNISHED THE CURRENT FOR THE ALPHABET WHEEL ONE FOR THE FIGURE WHEEL AND ONE FOR THE MECHANISM THAT TOOK CARE OF THE INKING AND PRINTING ON THE TAPE
IN SUCH CASES EDISON IS APT TO EXPRESS HIMSELF FREELY AND FORCIBLY AS WHEN HE WAS ASKED WHY HE HAD PARTED WITH A CERTAIN MAN HE SAID
WALL STREET IS AT ANY TIME AN INTERESTING STUDY BUT IT WAS NEVER AT A MORE AGITATED AND SENSATIONAL PERIOD OF ITS HISTORY THAN AT THIS TIME
I REMEMBER ONE MAN WHO HAD A SALOON ON NASSAU STREET

WHILE THE KEENNESS OF THE COMPETITION EXTENDING TO THE AGENTS AND EMPLOYEES OF BOTH COMPANIES BROUGHT ABOUT A SWIFT BUT QUITE UNFORESEEN AND UNLOOKED-FOR EXPANSION IN THE INDIVIDUAL EXCHANGES OF THE LARGER CITIES AND A CORRESPONDING ADVANCE IN THEIR IMPORTANCE VALUE AND USEFULNESS THE TRUTH OF THIS WAS IMMEDIATELY SHOWN IN 1894 AFTER THE BELL PATENTS HAD EXPIRED BY THE TREMENDOUS OUTBURST OF NEW COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY IN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY SYSTEMS AND TOLL LINES THROUGH SPARSELY SETTLED DISTRICTS--WORK FOR WHICH THE EDISON APPARATUS AND METHODS WERE PECULIARLY ADAPTED YET AGAINST WHICH THE INFLUENCE OF THE EDISON PATENT WAS INVOKED

THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE 100,000 OR MORE ISOLATED ELECTRIC-LIGHT PLANTS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE LAND
IN CASES OF EMERGENCY EDISON ALWAYS POSSESSED A KEEN FACULTY OF DECIDING IMMEDIATELY AND CORRECTLY WHAT TO DO
ANOTHER EPISODE OF THIS PERIOD IS CURIOUS IN ITS REVELATION OF THE TENACITY WITH WHICH EDISON HAS ALWAYS HELD TO SOME OF HIS OLDEST POSSESSIONS WITH A SENSE OF PERSONAL ATTACHMENT
WHEN THE ELECTRICAL PRESSURE WAS NORMAL NEITHER LAMP WAS LIGHTED
THAT WAS IN 1870
BUT PRESTO
THE REPORTERS ARE NEVER AWAY FROM THE LABORATORY VERY LONG
THEY CONTAINED THE CHEMICALS WITH WHICH HE WAS CONSTANTLY EXPERIMENTING

WHENEVER AN INVENTION OF LARGE PROSPECTIVE VALUE COMES OUT THESE CASES ALWAYS OCCUR
EDISON'S GREAT EFFORT--NOT TO MAKE A LARGE LIGHT OR A BLINDING LIGHT BUT A SMALL LIGHT HAVING THE MILDNESS OF GAS CURVES ARE THEN CALLED FOR OF IRON AND COPPER INVESTMENT--ALSO ENERGY LINE--CURVES OF CANDLE-POWER AND ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE
AND THE GOLD STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY FORMED TO EXPLOIT THE SYSTEM SOON INCREASED ITS CAPITAL FROM $200,000 TO $300,000 PAYING 12 PER CENT
WE STOPPED TO ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE OF THE EXCITEMENT
IT IS A TRITE SAYING THAT HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF AND CERTAINLY NO AXIOM CARRIES MORE TRUTH THAN THIS WHEN APPLIED TO THE HISTORY OF EACH OF EDISON'S IMPORTANT INVENTIONS
AND IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH ANY WORK AT ALL HE WAS OBLIGED TO DENY HIMSELF TO ALL BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT CALLERS
SEVERAL YEARS AGO EXPERIMENTING IN THIS FIELD EDISON DEVISED AND OPERATED SOME INGENIOUS PYROMAGNETIC MOTORS AND GENERATORS BASED AS THE NAME IMPLIES ON THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF HEAT TO THE MACHINES

AT THIS TIME MR EDISON HAD DISCOVERED THAT THE FIBRE OF A CERTAIN BAMBOO AFFORDED A VERY DESIRABLE CARBON FOR THE ELECTRIC LAMP AND THE VARIETY OF BAMBOO USED WAS A PRODUCT OF JAPAN
I TOOK OFF THE CLOTH GOT OUT THE BALLS PICKED OUT A CUE FOR MR EDISON AND WHEN WE BANKED FOR THE FIRST SHOT I WON AND STARTED THE GAME
NOW AS THERE ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED VARIATIONS IN THE QUALITY OF NICKEL FLAKE AND PERHAPS A THOUSAND WAYS TO MAKE THE HYDRATE IT WILL BE REALIZED THAT EDISON'S METHODS LED TO STUPENDOUS DETAIL FOR THESE TESTS EMBRACED A TRIAL OF ALL THE QUALITIES OF BOTH MATERIALS IN THE THREE PROPORTIONS FOUND TO BE MOST SUITABLE
IN OTHER WORDS HE HAD FOUND THE FORERUNNER OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY

HE WAS A SPLENDID MECHANIC WITH A VIGOROUS TEMPER AND WONDERFUL ABILITY TO WORK CONTINUOUSLY AND TO GET WORK OUT OF MEN
IT MAY SEEM STRANGE THAT GREAT EFFORT WAS REQUIRED TO INTRODUCE A LIGHT SO MANIFESTLY CONVENIENT SAFE AGREEABLE AND ADVANTAGEOUS BUT THE FACTS ARE MATTER OF RECORD

ON ACCOUNT OF THE HIGH SPEED OF THE ARMATURE SHAFT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO CONNECT WITH DRIVING-AXLES DIRECT BUT THIS WAS AN ADVANTAGE IN ONE WAY AS BY INTRODUCING AN INTERMEDIATE COUNTER-SHAFT CORRESPONDING TO THE WELL-KNOWN TYPE OF DOUBLE-REDUCTION MOTOR USED ON TROLLEY-CARS SINCE 1885 A FAIRLY GOOD ARRANGEMENT WAS OBTAINED TO REGULATE THE SPEED OF THE LOCOMOTIVE EXCLUSIVE OF RESISTANCE IN THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT
MATTERS GENERALLY AND THE MOTORS IN PARTICULAR WENT MUCH BETTER EVEN IF THE LOCOMOTIVE WAS SO FREELY FESTOONED WITH RESISTANCE-BOXES ALL OF PERCEPTIBLE WEIGHT AND OCCUPYING MUCH OF THE LIMITED SPACE
I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF HIS EXPERIMENTS ON THE BATTERY RAN UP PRETTY NEAR TO FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THEY FILL MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THE NOTE-BOOKS TO SAY NOTHING OF SOME THOUSANDS OF TESTS IN CURVE SHEETS ALTHOUGH EDISON HAS AN ABSOLUTE DISREGARD FOR THE TOTAL OUTLAY OF MONEY IN INVESTIGATION HE IS PARTICULAR TO KEEP DOWN THE COST OF INDIVIDUAL EXPERIMENTS TO A MINIMUM FOR AS HE OBSERVED TO ONE OF HIS ASSISTANTS
AND IN ONE CASE COMMENTING ON THE OILING SYSTEM AT THE CEMENT PLANT HE WROTE
WHILE THESE EXPLORATIONS WERE IN PROGRESS AS INDEED LONG BEFORE HE HAD GIVEN MUCH THOUGHT TO THE PRODUCTION OF SOME ARTIFICIAL COMPOUND THAT WOULD EMBRACE NOT ONLY THE REQUIRED HOMOGENEITY BUT ALSO MANY OTHER QUALIFICATIONS NECESSARY FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF AN IMPROVED TYPE OF LAMP WHICH HAD BECOME DESIRABLE BY REASON OF THE RAPID ADOPTION OF HIS LIGHTING SYSTEM

BY DOING THESE THINGS HE MADE A LAMP WHICH WAS PRACTICALLY OPERATIVE AND SUCCESSFUL THE EMBRYO OF THE BEST LAMPS NOW IN COMMERCIAL USE AND BUT FOR WHICH THE SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT BY INCANDESCENCE WOULD STILL BE NOTHING BUT THE IGNIS FATUUS WHICH IT WAS PROCLAIMED TO BE IN 1879 BY SOME OF THE REAMED EXPERTS WHO ARE NOW WITNESSES TO BELITTLE HIS ACHIEVEMENT AND SHOW THAT IT DID NOT RISE TO THE DIGNITY OF AN INVENTION
AFTER A GALVANOMETER DEFLECTION HAS BEEN OBTAINED THROUGH THE EXPANSION OR CONTRACTION OF THE STRIP BY REASON OF A CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE A SIMILAR DEFLECTION IS OBTAINED MECHANICALLY BY TURNING THE SCREW S ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
ONE AFTERNOON GOULD STARTED IN TO EXPLAIN THE GREAT FUTURE OF THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD WHICH HE THEN CONTROLLED
ONE OF THE ELECTRODES IS CONNECTED WITH THE DIAPHRAGM ON WHICH THE SOUND-WAVES IMPINGE AND THE VIBRATIONS OF THIS DIAPHRAGM CAUSE CORRESPONDING VARIATIONS IN PRESSURE BETWEEN THE ELECTRODES AND THEREBY EFFECT SIMILAR VARIATIONS IN THE CURRENT WHICH IS PASSING OVER THE LINE TO THE RECEIVING END
THESE ARMATURES ARE HELD IN PLACE BY TWO CIRCULAR IRON PLATES THROUGH THE CENTRE OF WHICH RUNS A SHAFT CARRYING AT ITS LOWER EXTREMITY A SEMICIRCULAR SHIELD OF FIRE-CLAY WHICH COVERS THE ENDS OF FOUR OF THE ARMATURES
IT WAS THE FIRST LINGUISTIC CONCOURSE SINCE BABEL TIMES
IT IS IN THIS LITTLE PLACE THAT THERE WAS DEVELOPED THE REMARKABLE MIXTURE WHICH IS TO PLAY SO VITAL A PART IN THE SUCCESSFUL CONSTRUCTION OF THESE EVERLASTING HOMES FOR LIVING MILLIONS
ALWAYS A CURIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY IN ITS VARIETY AND VOLUME
THIS ROAD ALSO HAD SOME FEATURES OF CONVENTIONAL RAILROADS SUCH AS SIDINGS TURN-TABLES FREIGHT PLATFORM AND CAR-HOUSE
YOU ARE TOO PAINFULLY HONEST I SAID TO HIM
TO SHOW HOW LITTLE SOME FUNDAMENTAL METHODS CAN CHANGE IN FIFTY YEARS IT MAY BE NOTED THAT HALL CONVEYED THE CURRENT TO HIS TINY CAR THROUGH FORTY FEET OF RAIL USING THE RAIL AS CONDUCTOR JUST AS EDISON DID MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS LATER IN HIS HISTORIC EXPERIMENTS FOR VILLARD AT MENLO PARK
23 1901 704,305 REVERSIBLE GALVANIC BATTERY
OF THE MOTIVE POWER EMPLOYED OR TO 38 1/2 PER CENT
4 1890 476,984 EXPANSIBLE PULLEY
A VERY HURRIED DEPARTURE WAS EFFECTED IN SECRET FROM THE SCENE OF TROUBLE AND THERE ARE ROMANTIC TRADITIONS OF HIS THRILLING JOURNEY OF ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-TWO MILES TOWARD SAFETY MADE ALMOST ENTIRELY WITHOUT FOOD OR SLEEP THROUGH A WILD COUNTRY INFESTED WITH INDIANS OF UNFRIENDLY DISPOSITION
A FURTHER INSTANCE OF THIS KIND IS A METHOD OF TELEGRAPHY AT SEA BY MEANS OF A DIAPHRAGM IN A CLOSED PORT-HOLE FLUSH WITH THE SIDE OF THE VESSEL AND ACTUATED BY A STEAM-WHISTLE WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY A LEVER SIMILARLY TO A MORSE KEY
WHEN THE TAPE THUS MADE READY IS RUN RAPIDLY THROUGH A TRANSMITTING MACHINE ELECTRICAL CONTACT OCCURS WHEREVER THERE IS A PERFORATION PERMITTING THE CURRENT FROM THE BATTERY TO FLOW INTO THE LINE AND THUS TRANSMIT SIGNALS CORRESPONDINGLY
AROUND THE ROOM ON SHELVES ARE HUNDREDS OF BOTTLES EACH CONTAINING A SMALL QUANTITY OF NICKEL HYDRATE MADE IN AS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS EACH LABELLED CORRESPONDINGLY
THIS HOWEVER HE DEEMED TO BE A MOST UNECONOMICAL PROCESS FOR ENERGY STORED AS HEAT UNITS IN DYNAMITE AT $260 PER TON WAS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THAT OF CALORIES IN A TON OF COAL AT $3 PER TON
THE ONLY TRIAL OF ANY MAGNITUDE OF THE BRIQUETTES IN THE BLAST-FURNACE WAS CARRIED THROUGH EARLY THIS YEAR AT THE CRANE IRON WORKS CATASAUQUA PENNSYLVANIA BY LEONARD PECKITT
THE EVENING SUN NEW YORK OBTAINED AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM AT THAT TIME AND IN ITS ISSUE OF MAY 2 1889 GAVE MORE THAN A PAGE TO A BRIEF STORY OF HIS INTERESTING ADVENTURES AND THEN COMMENTED EDITORIALLY UPON THEM AS FOLLOWS
16 1906 930,949 APPARATUS FOR BURNING PORTLAND CEMENT
IT WAS HIS BELIEF THAT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD OTHER AND SUPERIOR VARIETIES MIGHT BE FOUND AND TO THAT END HE HAD DISPATCHED EXPLORERS TO BAMBOO REGIONS IN THE VALLEYS OF THE GREAT SOUTH AMERICAN RIVERS WHERE SPECIMENS WERE FOUND OF EXTRAORDINARY QUALITY
25 1881 251,550 MAGNETO OR DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINES
AND SAID I WANTED THEM TO GIVE ME A LETTER TO THE CITY BANK
AND THEN THE SHOW RECEIPTS DECLINED AND DWINDLED AWAY
FIFTY MEN WERE READY TO HELP THE STEVEDORES GET IT ON THE STEAMER--AND WE WERE ONE HOUR AHEAD OF TIME THIS EXPOSITION BRINGS US INDEED TO A DRAMATIC AND RATHER PATHETIC PARTING OF THE WAYS
POSSIBLY THE SEVERER DISCIPLINE AFTER THE HAPPY-GO-LUCKY REGIME IN THE SOUTHERN CITY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS RESTLESSNESS WHICH AGAIN MANIFESTED ITSELF HOWEVER ON HIS RETURN THITHER
HE WAS POETIC HIGHLY EDUCATED AND A BRILLIANT TALKER
HIS REMARK ABOUT EDISON THAT HIS INGENUITY INSPIRED CONFIDENCE AND WAVERING FINANCIERS STIFFENED UP WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT HE WAS TO DEVELOP THE AUTOMATIC IS A NOTEWORTHY EVIDENCE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD ALREADY GAINED A FIRM FOOTING
AND IN THIS MANNER THE METER COULD BE KEPT FROM FREEZING
HE MIGHT HAVE SPENT THE FULL TERM THERE BUT AS ALREADY NOTED HIS TEACHER HAD FOUND HIM ADDLED HE WAS ALWAYS ACCORDING TO HIS OWN RECOLLECTION AT THE FOOT OF THE CLASS AND HAD COME ALMOST TO REGARD HIMSELF AS A DUNCE WHILE HIS FATHER ENTERTAINED VAGUE ANXIETIES AS TO HIS STUPIDITY
THESE WERE ATTENDED BY TWO BOYS WHO SHARED IN THE PROFITS
THAT'S ALL RIGHT
THE PENCILS HAVE FLAT FLANGES AT THE ENDS FORMED BY CLOSING IN THE METAL CASE BY WHICH THEY ARE SUPPORTED AND ELECTRICAL CONNECTION IS MADE
FIFTY WERE QUICKLY BUILT AND FULLY DESCRIBED IN ADVERTISING FOR MECHANICS
THE THEATRE WAS NEVER PIPED FOR GAS
I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW I CAME TO OVERLOOK THEM
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE NEW ART OR DEVICE THE WORLD HAS EVER ENJOYED OF WHICH IT CAN BE SAID THAT IT WAS GIVEN AN IMMEDIATE AND ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION
IT IS TO BE NOTICED AS A FEATURE OF THE PLANT IN COMMON WITH MANY OF LATER CONSTRUCTION THAT IT WAS PLACED WELL AWAY FROM THE WATER'S EDGE AND EQUIPPED WITH NON-CONDENSING ENGINES
THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE BLANK RECORDS OF WHICH LARGE NUMBERS HAVE ALSO BEEN SUPPLIED TO THE PUBLIC
IT HAD NOT BEEN EDISON'S INTENTION TO CATER TO THIS CLASS OF CUSTOMER UNTIL HIS BROAD CENTRAL-STATION PLAN HAD BEEN WORKED OUT AND HE HAS ALWAYS DISCOURAGED THE ISOLATED PLANT WITHIN THE LIMITS OF URBAN CIRCUITS
THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THE VOTE THE NEXT DAY WOULD GO A CERTAIN WAY
DOCTOR LAWS WHO AFTERWARD BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI WAS AN INVENTOR OF UNUSUAL ABILITY AND ATTAINMENTS
JUST THIRTY YEARS LATER ON A SIMILAR TRIP OVER THE SAME GROUND HE JOTTED DOWN FOR THIS VOLUME SOME OF HIS REMINISCENCES
IN THIS INSTANCE IT WAS NOT OCCUPIED AND I WAS GIVEN THE POSITION IN THE PROMPTER'S SEAT AND SAW THE WHOLE BALLET AT CLOSE RANGE
A NUMBER OF THE EDISON OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES ASSEMBLED AT GOERCK STREET TO SEE THIS GIGANTIC MACHINE GO INTO ACTION AND WATCHED ITS PERFORMANCE WITH DUE REVERENCE ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK ON SUNDAY MORNING WHEN IT RESPECTED THE CONVENTIONALITIES BY BREAKING A SHAFT AND SUSPENDING FURTHER TESTS
EVEN WITH THE CHANGES WHICH WERE THUS MADE IN THE TWO MACHINES THE WORK OF DEVELOPING THE BUSINESS WAS SLOW AS A DEMAND HAD TO BE CREATED
THE SHIP-OWNERS AND REFINERS OF THAT WHALING METROPOLIS WERE SLOW TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR MONOPOLY COULD EVER BE THREATENED BY NEWER SOURCES OF ILLUMINATION
GIVE ME A CENT I GAVE HIM A NICKEL AND HE ELBOWED HIS WAY IN
BUT THIS CURRENT IS TOO WEAK TO AFFECT THE TELEGRAPH RELAY
TO TELL THE WHOLE STORY IN DETAIL AND SHOW ITS LOGICAL SEQUENCE STEP BY STEP WOULD TAKE LITTLE LESS THAN A VOLUME IN ITSELF FOR EDISON'S METHODS ALWAYS ICONOCLASTIC WHEN PROGRESS IS IN SIGHT WERE PARTICULARLY SO AT THE PERIOD IN QUESTION
I TOOK PERSONAL CHARGE OF RUNNING DOWN THIS MAN AND HIS PRETENSIONS IN THE SECTION OF THE CITY WHERE HE LIVED AND AMONG HIS OLD NEIGHBORS
HALF-ROUND COPPER CONDUCTORS WERE USED KEPT IN PLACE RELATIVELY TO EACH OTHER AND IN THE TUBE FIRST OF ALL BY A HEAVY PIECE OF CARDBOARD AND LATER ON BY A ROPE
IF REIS HAD BEEN WILLING TO EXPERIMENT WITH HIS APPARATUS SO THAT IT DID NOT MAKE-AND-BREAK HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN THE TRUE FATHER OF THE TELEPHONE BESIDES GIVING IT THE NAME BY WHICH IT IS KNOWN
ALL MY WEALTH IS CONTAINED IN MY METALLIC TRAVELLING CASE AND YOU ARE WELCOME TO IT THE CASE CONTAINED ONE PAPER COLLAR
FINALLY I WENT DOWN TO GOERCK STREET AND GOT A PIECE OF SHAFTING AND A TUBE IN WHICH IT FITTED

THUS IN 1893 THE LITIGATION WAS REOPENED AND A PROTRACTED SERIES OF STUBBORNLY CONTESTED CONFLICTS WAS FOUGHT IN THE COURTS
HE ARRIVED IN HAVANA ON TUESDAY AND ON THE FRIDAY FOLLOWING HE WAS BURIED HAVING DIED OF THE BLACK VOMIT
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS EAGERLY ACCEPTED
SPECIAL PROVISION WAS ALSO MADE FOR INJECTING STREAMS OF PULVERIZED COAL IN SUCH MANNER AS TO CREATE THE LARGELY EXTENDED ZONE OF COMBUSTION
JUST AFTER THE ITEM LAST ABOVE EXTRACTED THE EDISON SHOP BECAME GREATLY RUSHED ON TELEGRAPHIC INVENTIONS AND NOT MANY MONTHS AFTERWARD CAME THE REMOVAL TO MENLO PARK
MR HAMBLET WAS THE FATHER AND INTRODUCER IN AFTER YEARS OF THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH SYSTEM OF TIME DISTRIBUTION
EDISON'S PEDIGREE III
ONE DAY IN THE SUMMER OF 1881 WHEN THE INCANDESCENT LAMP-INDUSTRY WAS STILL IN SWADDLING CLOTHES EDISON WAS SEATED IN THE ROOM OF MAJOR EATON VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY TALKING OVER BUSINESS MATTERS WHEN MR UPTON CAME IN FROM THE LAMP FACTORY AT MENLO PARK AND SAID
THE PAPER TAPE PASSED OVER A CYLINDER AND WAS KEPT IN REGULAR MOTION SO AS TO RECEIVE THE PERFORATIONS IN PROPER SEQUENCE
THE FIRST MAN AS HE ENTERED DIPPED HIS HANDS IN THE WATER
28 1878 214,636 ELECTRIC LIGHTS
IF I HAD MADE USE OF MY OWN WORK I SHOULD HAVE HAD LONG-DISTANCE WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY IN ONE OF THE APPENDICES TO THIS BOOK IS GIVEN A BRIEF TECHNICAL ACCOUNT OF EDISON'S INVESTIGATIONS OF THE PHENOMENA WHICH LIE AT THE ROOT OF MODERN WIRELESS OR SPACE TELEGRAPHY AND THE ATTENTION OF THE READER IS DIRECTED PARTICULARLY TO THE DESCRIPTION AND QUOTATIONS THERE FROM THE FAMOUS NOTE-BOOKS OF EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS IN REGARD TO WHAT HE CALLED ETHERIC FORCE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT AS EARLY AS 1875 EDISON DETECTED AND STUDIED CERTAIN PHENOMENA--I.E THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICAL EFFECTS IN NON-CLOSED CIRCUITS WHICH FOR A TIME MADE HIM THINK HE WAS ON THE TRAIL OF A NEW FORCE AS THERE WAS NO PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THEM BY THE THEN KNOWN LAWS OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
BY FRICTION
HERE HE PLACED A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER ON A DRAUGHTING-TABLE AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO DRAW OUT A PLAN OF THE PROPOSED WORKS CONTINUING ALL DAY AND AWAY INTO THE EVENING WHEN HE FINISHED
31 1888 1889 406,569 PHONOGRAM BLANK
I WAS ABOUT TO AWAKEN THE FIREMAN TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF THIS WHEN IT STOPPED
THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY II
AROUND THE SIDES OF THE ROOM BOUNDING THIS OPEN SPACE RUN TWO TIERS OF GALLERY DIVIDED AS IS THE MAIN FLOOR BENEATH THEM
THE FIRST EMBRACES SUCH ARTS AND INDUSTRIES OR SUCH APPARATUS AS HAVE ALREADY BEEN TREATED
OTHER RAILROADS ALSO PREVENTED ANY FURTHER COMPETITION BY THE CANAL FOR A BRANCH OF THE WHEELING LAKE ERIE NOW PASSES THROUGH THE VILLAGE WHILE THE LAKE SHORE MICHIGAN SOUTHERN RUNS A FEW MILES TO THE SOUTH
THE CRAFT OF AN OPERATOR LEARNED WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY IS VERY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUTH BUT A POSITION AT THE KEY IS NO PLACE FOR A MAN OF MATURE YEARS
EDISON WAS IN REALITY DOING SOME HEAVY ELECTRIC-RAILWAY ENGINEERING HIS APPARATUS FULL OF IDEAS SUGGESTIONS PROPHECIES
10 WIRE PASSING THROUGH HIS SLEEVES AND AROUND HIS BACK SO THAT HIS HANDS WOULD CONCEAL THE ENDS AND NO ONE WOULD KNOW HE HAD IT
AND FRANK A
HERE WERE MADE ALL THE SMALL THINGS USED ON THE ELECTRIC-LIGHTING SYSTEM SUCH AS SOCKETS CHANDELIERS SWITCHES METERS ETC
THE ISSUE IS FACTORIES OR DEATH MR EDISON INVITED THE COOPERATION OF HIS LEADING STOCKHOLDERS
THE METHOD OF TRANSMISSION WILL PRESENTLY APPEAR
THE LODESTONE AND THE COMPASS
THE OPERATOR NEXT SENDS THE LETTER M BY DEPRESSING THE APPROPRIATE KEY
14 1889 443,507 PHONOGRAPH DEC
THE PORTLAND CEMENT BUSINESS HAS ALREADY BEEN DEALT WITH SEPARATELY AND ALTHOUGH THE ABOVE REMARKS ARE APPROPRIATE TO IT ALSO EDISON BEING ITS HEAD AND INFORMING SPIRIT THE FOLLOWING PAGES ARE INTENDED TO BE DEVOTED TO THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE GROUPED AROUND THE LABORATORY AT ORANGE AND THAT MAY BE TAKEN AS TYPICAL OF EDISON'S METHODS ON THE MANUFACTURING SIDE
EDISON STARTED OUT BY DRAWING FROM HIS DESK A CHECK-BOOK AND STATING HOW MUCH MONEY HE HAD IN THE BANK
RECENTLY ONE OF THE WRITERS HAD OCCASION TO PRESENT TO HIM A LONG TYPEWRITTEN DOCUMENT OF UPWARD OF THIRTY PAGES FOR HIS APPROVAL
HE HAD ARRANGED TWENTY JARS WITH PLATINUM ELECTRODES HELD IN PLACE BY HARD RUBBER
BESIDES IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN THE RADIATION OF A ROUGHENED BODY FOR HEAT IS GREATER THAN A POLISHED ONE LIKE PLATINA PROCEEDING LOGICALLY UPON THESE LINES OF THOUGHT AND FOLLOWING THEM OUT THROUGH MANY RAMIFICATIONS WE HAVE SEEN HOW HE AT LENGTH MADE A FILAMENT OF CARBON OF HIGH RESISTANCE AND SMALL RADIATING SURFACE AND THROUGH A CONCURRENT INVESTIGATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF HIGH VACUA AND OCCLUDED GASES WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE A TRUE INCANDESCENT LAMP
BUT SOMEHOW THE NECESSITY OF MANUFACTURING IS CONSTANTLY THRUST BACK UPON HIM BY A PROFOUND--PERHAPS FINICAL--SENSE OF DISSATISFACTION WITH WHAT OTHER PEOPLE MAKE FOR HIM
IN THESE EARLY EXPERIMENTS HOWEVER IT WAS RECOGNIZED THAT TO SECURE PROPER RESULTS A SINGLE CAMERA SHOULD BE USED SO THAT THE OBJECTS MIGHT MOVE ACROSS ITS FIELD JUST AS THEY MOVE ACROSS THE FIELD OF THE HUMAN EYE
BUT ALL WAS NOT WELL AND AS HAS HAPPENED SO OFTEN BEFORE THE POLITICS OF FATHER AND SON WERE VIOLENTLY DIFFERENT
ISN'T IT A SHAME THAT WITH THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK YOU HAVE DONE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY RESULTS EDISON TURNED ON ME LIKE A FLASH AND WITH A SMILE REPLIED
THIS MEDAL WAS FOUNDED IN 1902 BY THE PROFESSIONAL FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES OF THE VETERAN AMERICAN IRONMASTER AND METALLURGICAL INVENTOR IN HONOR OF HIS EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY
EDISON RAN IT AND JUST AFTER WE STARTED THERE WAS A TRESTLE SIXTY FEET LONG AND SEVEN FEET DEEP AND EDISON PUT ON ALL THE POWER
THERE WAS PLENTY OF LEISURE ON THE TWO DAILY RUNS EVEN FOR AN INDUSTRIOUS BOY AND THUS HE FOUND TIME TO TRANSFER HIS LABORATORY FROM THE CELLAR AND RE-ESTABLISH IT ON THE TRAIN
THIS VIEW HOWEVER IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH FACTS
IT TOOK MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER THE EVOLUTION OF THE LAMP FOR EDISON TO GET INTO POSITION TO DO ACTUAL BUSINESS AND DURING THAT TIME HIS LABORATORY WAS THE NATURAL MECCA OF EVERY INQUIRING PERSON
AND HENCE AS IN THE CASE OF THE EDISON LIGHT AN EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN OF A PRACTICAL NATURE IS A FUNDAMENTAL CONDITION OF SUCCESS
THE GOEBEL STORY WAS TOLD BY THE AFFIDAVITS IN AN INGENUOUS MANNER WITH A WEALTH OF SIMPLE HOMELY DETAIL THAT CARRIED ON ITS FACE AN APPEARANCE OF TRUTH CALCULATED TO DECEIVE THE ELECT HAD NOT THE ELECT BEEN SOMEWHAT PREPARED BY THEIR INVESTIGATION MADE SOME ELEVEN YEARS BEFORE
A MERE RECITAL BY TITLES OF THE VAST NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS AND TESTS ON CARBONS LAMPS DYNAMOS ARMATURES COMMUTATORS WINDINGS SYSTEMS REGULATORS SOCKETS VACUUM-PUMPS AND THE THOUSAND AND ONE DETAILS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT IN GENERAL ORIGINATED BY EDISON AND METHODICALLY AND SYSTEMATICALLY CARRIED ON UNDER HIS GENERAL DIRECTION WOULD FILL A GREAT MANY PAGES HERE AND EVEN THEN WOULD SERVE ONLY TO CONVEY A CONFUSED IMPRESSION OF CEASELESS PROBING
THE INDICATING INSTRUMENTS WERE OF THE CRUDEST CONSTRUCTION CONSISTING OF TWO VOLTMETERS CONNECTED BY PRESSURE WIRES TO THE CENTRE OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION
AT THE VERY LEAST SUCH A TASK MUST HAVE OCCUPIED SEVERAL HOURS
BUT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF EVEN AN ILLUSION OF MOTION AND WITH THE PHILOSOPHY OF PERSISTENCE OF VISION FULLY UNDERSTOOD IT WOULD SEEM THAT UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSTANTANEOUS PHOTOGRAPHY THE REPRODUCTION OF ACTUAL MOTION BY MEANS OF PICTURES WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED ALMOST AS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE
EDISON IN COMMERCE AND MANUFACTURE XXVII
WE SAT AT THE TAIL-END OF THE BOAT AND HE STARTED IN TO TELL FUNNY STORIES
AND FINALLY THE IRON WHICH HAD GENERALLY ENJOYED SUPERIORITY IN CAPACITY OVER ITS COMPANION THE NICKEL ELEMENT HAD TO GO IN TRAINING IN ORDER TO RETAIN ITS LEAD WHICH WAS IMPERATIVE IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A UNIFORM AND CONSTANT VOLTAGE CURVE
9 1884 422,579 TELEPHONE REPEATER DEC
14 1882 276,233 ELECTRICAL GENERATOR AND MOTOR NOV
AND FOR A NORMAL EYE SUCH AN EXHIBITION WOULD PRESENT A SUBSTANTIALLY CONTINUOUS PHOTOGRAPH
MR VAIL HAD CHARGE OF THE DYNAMO-ROOM
8 1877 203 018 TELEPHONE OR SPEAKING TELEGRAPH
AND WHEN THE WORK WAS DONE THE REWARD WAS A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH--IN THE ART OF ILLUMINATION
MAY 9 1876 186,330 ACOUSTIC ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHS MAY 9 1876 186,548 TELEGRAPH ALARM AND SIGNAL APPARATUS MAY 9 1876 198,087 TELEPHONIC TELEGRAPHS
EUGENE LEWIS OF EATON LEWIS HAD THIS IN HAND FOR ME
IT MAY BE OF INTEREST HOWEVER TO MENTION SOME OF ITS DIMENSIONS AND ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS QUOTING AGAIN FROM MR CLARKE
THIS LEFT THE REMAINDER OF THE COUNTRY OPEN FOR THE CASH SALE OF PLANTS WHEREVER REQUESTED
BUT EXPERT CLARKE APPEARS FOR THE PLAINTIFF AND AFTER SETTING FORTH JUST AS MINUTELY HIS SUPERIOR QUALIFICATIONS MECHANICAL EDUCATION AND GREAT EXPERIENCE WHICH APPEAR FULLY EQUAL IN ALL RESPECTS TO THOSE OF EXPERT OSBORN PROCEEDS TO TAKE UP IN DETAIL THE PATENT CLAIMS AND SHOWS TO HIS ENTIRE SATISFACTION THAT ALL WITH POSSIBLY ONE EXCEPTION ARE NEW SHOW INVENTIVE GENIUS AND DISTINCT ADVANCES UPON THE PRIOR ART
THESE PATENTS WERE NOT BY ANY MEANS ALL THAT HE APPLIED FOR IN THE YEAR 1880 WHICH IT WILL BE REMEMBERED WAS THE YEAR IN WHICH HE WAS PERFECTING THE INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP AND METHODS TO PUT INTO THE MARKET FOR COMPETITION WITH GAS
I DON'T KNOW
HE TRIED IT THE SECOND TIME WITH THE SAME RESULT
BESIDES ONE MUST ALSO GIVE HIM THE CREDIT AS ALREADY NOTED FOR HAVING RECOGNIZED THE NECESSITY FOR A PURE QUALITY OF COPPER FOR ELECTRIC CONDUCTORS AND FOR HIS PERSISTENCE IN HAVING COMPELLED THE MANUFACTURERS OF THAT PERIOD TO INTRODUCE NEW AND ADDITIONAL METHODS OF REFINEMENT SO AS TO BRING ABOUT THAT RESULT WHICH IS NOW A SINE QUA NON
ALTHOUGH EDISON HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT BAMBOO FURNISHED THE MOST DESIRABLE MATERIAL THUS FAR DISCOVERED FOR INCANDESCENT-LAMP FILAMENTS HE FELT THAT IN SOME PART OF THE WORLD THERE MIGHT BE FOUND A NATURAL PRODUCT OF THE SAME GENERAL CHARACTER THAT WOULD FURNISH A STILL MORE PERFECT AND HOMOGENEOUS MATERIAL
AND I THINK ALSO THAT THIS COURT SHOULD HAVE THE POWER TO SUMMON BEFORE IT AND EXAMINE ANY RECOGNIZED EXPERT IN THE SPECIAL ART WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO TESTIFY TO FACTS FOR OR AGAINST THE PATENT INSTEAD OF TRYING TO GATHER THE TRUTH FROM THE TEDIOUS ESSAYS OF HIRED EXPERTS WHOSE DEPOSITIONS ARE REALLY NOTHING BUT SWORN ARGUMENTS
I REMEMBER HE SAYS THE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE CELEBRATED POET AND JOURNALIST GEORGE D
AND THE REPLY CAME IN QUITE LOUD TONES THAT IT WAS A MAN WITH MR E
THE CITY OF PARIS GAVE ME A DINNER AT THE NEW HOTEL DE VILLE WHICH WAS ALSO LIGHTED WITH THE EDISON SYSTEM
14 1882 430,932 MANUFACTURE OF INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
AND HE POINTS TO THE PREDICAMENT NOW CONFRONTING THEM AS TRUTH OF HIS ASSERTION THAT WHEN SELLING LIGHT THEY SHARE IN ALL THE BENEFITS OF IMPROVEMENT BUT THAT WHEN THEY SELL CURRENT THE CONSUMER GETS ALL THOSE BENEFITS WITHOUT DIVISION
ONE NOTABLE AFTERNOON WAS THAT ON WHICH THE NEW YORK BOARD OF ALDERMEN TOOK A SPECIAL TRAIN OUT TO MENLO PARK TO SEE THE LIGHTING SYSTEM WITH ITS CONDUCTORS UNDERGROUND IN OPERATION
MAREY WAS LIMITED TO A VERY FEW PHOTOGRAPHS BECAUSE THE ENTIRE SURFACE HAD TO BE STOPPED AND STARTED IN CONNECTION WITH EACH EXPOSURE
AS MY BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS HAD NOT BEEN VERY PERFECTLY MADE I LOST THE USUAL AMOUNT GOING TO ANOTHER EXTREME WE FIND EDISON GRAPPLING WITH ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS KNOWN TO THE AUTHORITIES OF NEW YORK--THE DISPOSAL OF ITS HEAVY SNOWS
HERE IS A CHANCE TO SAVE A MILL PER BARREL BASED ON YOUR REGULAR DAILY OUTPUT THIS THOROUGH CONSIDERATION OF THE SMALLEST DETAIL IS ESSENTIALLY CHARACTERISTIC OF EDISON NOT ONLY IN ECONOMY OF MANUFACTURE BUT IN ALL HIS WORK NO MATTER OF WHAT KIND WHETHER IT BE EXPERIMENTING INVESTIGATING TESTING OR ENGINEERING
BUT THIS DOES NOT REFLECT UPON OR DIMINISH THE INGENUITY REQUIRED FOR ITS INVENTION
BEHIND WHICH WAS THE OFFICE OF THE AGENT OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
THE SUBSTANTIAL AND OFTTIMES CORPULENT GHOST OR SPIRIT OF THE REAL STAGE HAS BEEN SUCCEEDED BY AN INTANGIBLE WRAITH AS TRANSPARENT AND UNSUBSTANTIAL AS MAY BE DEMANDED IN THE BEST BOOK OF FAIRY TALES--MORE DOUBLE EXPOSURE
BUT WITH ITS IMPROVED FORM THERE HAS COME A VAST INCREASE OF BUSINESS
THE FIRST STATION CALLED UTICA WAS A SMALL ONE WHERE I GENERALLY SOLD TWO PAPERS
I SAID TO HIM SEVERAL TIMES THAT IF HE WAS SO SURE THE KILN COULD TURN OUT ONE THOUSAND BARRELS IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS WE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE HIM TELL US HOW TO DO IT AND THAT WE WOULD RUN IT IN ANY WAY HE DIRECTED
BUT IF THERE BE BLAME FOR THAT IT ATTACHES TO THE AMERICAN SPIRIT OF SPECULATION AND NOT TO THE INGENIOUS MECHANISM WHICH READS AND REGISTERS THE BEATING OF THE FINANCIAL PULSE
TO THE LAY MIND IT WOULD SEEM THAT THIS MUST HAVE BEEN THE OBVIOUS DEVICE TO MAKE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ELECTRIC LIGHT BY INCANDESCENCE OF CARBON OR OTHER MATERIAL
BOUND SERIES OF IMPORTANT TECHNICAL MAGAZINES
BETTER THAN THAT IN USE AT THE LAMP FACTORY I DECIDED IT WAS UNNECESSARY TO VISIT THESE COUNTRIES OR NEW GUINEA AS MY EUREKA HAD ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THAT I WOULD THEREFORE SET FORTH OVER THE RETURN HEMISPHERE SEARCHING CHINA AND JAPAN ON THE WAY
JOHNSON TELLS OF THE CONDITIONS
HIS WAS THE MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT OF CONCEIVING AND EXECUTING IN ALL ITS DETAILS AN ART AND AN INDUSTRY ABSOLUTELY NEW TO THE WORLD
THESE MACHINES WERE ALSO UPON A SOLID FOUNDATION AND NO TROUBLE WAS EXPERIENCED
HE ABANDONED THE ATTEMPT TO CUT DASHES AS SUCH IN THE PAPER TAPE BUT INSTEAD PUNCHED THREE ROUND HOLES SO ARRANGED AS TO FORM A TRIANGLE
IT WAS MR EDISON'S IDEA AS I UNDERSTOOD IT AT THAT TIME TO BUILD A LOCOMOTIVE ALONG THE GENERAL LINES OF STEAM LOCOMOTIVES AT LEAST IN OUTWARD APPEARANCE AND TO COMBINE IN THAT RESPECT THE FRAMEWORK TRUCK AND OTHER PARTS KNOWN TO BE SATISFACTORY IN STEAM LOCOMOTIVES AT THE SAME TIME
WELL MR EDISON I MUST FIRST OF ALL GET A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM MY BOARD OF EDUCATION AND ASSIST THE BOARD TO SECURE A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE TIME OF MY ABSENCE
HE MADE NEITHER NOTES NOR MEMORANDA BUT THE EXAMINATION REQUIRED ALL THE DAY WHICH HAPPENED TO BE A SATURDAY
NOVEMBER 30 1875
HE WAS SO EXCITED THAT HE HAD THE OPERATOR WRITE THE MESSAGE FOR HIM
NO SEPARATE FIGURES ARE AVAILABLE TO SHOW THE EXTENT OF ITS EMPLOYMENT IN THE SECOND AND FOURTH CLASSES AS THEY ARE PROBABLY INCLUDED IN MACHINES COMING UNDER THE FIRST SUBDIVISION
THE CAMARADERIE THAT EXISTED AT THIS TIME WAS VERY DEMOCRATIC FOR ALL WERE WORKERS IN A COMMON CAUSE

17 1882 543,987 FILAMENT FOR INCANDESCENT LAMPS
IN HIS INTERESTING ACKNOWLEDGMENT MR RATHENAU TOLD HOW HE WENT TO PARIS IN 1881 AND AT THE ELECTRICAL EXHIBITION THERE SAW THE DISPLAY OF EDISON'S INVENTIONS IN ELECTRIC LIGHTING WHICH HAVE MET WITH AS LITTLE PROPER APPRECIATION AS HIS COUNTLESS INNOVATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH TELEGRAPHY TELEPHONY AND THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY HE SAW THE EDISON DYNAMO AND HE SAW THE INCANDESCENT LAMP OF WHICH MILLIONS HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED SINCE THAT DAY WITHOUT THE GREAT MASTER BEING PAID THE TRIBUTE TO HIS INVENTION BUT WHAT IMPRESSED THE OBSERVANT THOROUGHGOING GERMAN WAS THE BREADTH WITH WHICH THE WHOLE LIGHTING ART HAD BEEN ELABORATED AND PERFECTED EVEN AT THAT EARLY DAY
28 1879 227,227 ELECTRIC LIGHTS
INDEED THE ANNUAL PRODUCT OF THE EDISON MANUFACTURING COMPANY IN THIS LINE IS ONLY A FRACTIONAL PART OF THE TOTAL THAT IS ABSORBED BY THE 8000 OR MORE MOTION-PICTURE THEATRES AND EXHIBITIONS THAT ARE IN OPERATION IN THE UNITED STATES AT THE PRESENT TIME AND WHICH REPRESENT AN INVESTMENT OF SOME $45,000,000
29 THE IDEA OF MAINTAINING A CONSTANT POTENTIAL AND OF PROPORTIONING THE CURRENT TO THE NUMBER OF LAMPS IN CIRCUIT DID NOT OCCUR TO MOST OF THESE EARLY INVESTIGATORS AS A FEASIBLE METHOD OF OVERCOMING THE SUPPOSED DIFFICULTY
THIS ARRANGEMENT INTERFERED WITH CORRECT METER REGISTRATION AS THE METERS ON ONE SIDE OF THE SYSTEM REGISTERED BACKWARD DURING THE HOURS IN WHICH THE COMBINATION WAS EMPLOYED
IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT IGNORANCE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE OFFERS AN EXCUSE
AND LIKEWISE TO THIS END THE COMBINED RESISTANCE OF THE GENERATOR ARMATURES IN MULTIPLE ARC WAS KEPT RELATIVELY SMALL BY ADJUSTING THE NUMBER OF GENERATORS OPERATING IN MULTIPLE AT ANY TIME TO THE NUMBER OF LAMPS THEN IN USE
FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS EDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOERCK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
BRING IT DOWN AND MAKE A STUDY OF IT
I HAD MADE UP MY MIND IT WAS CERTAINLY WORTH $25,000 IF IT EVER AMOUNTED TO ANYTHING FOR CENTRAL-STATION WORK SO THAT WAS THE SUM I HAD IN MIND TO STICK TO AND GET--OBSTINATELY

WHAT WITH THESE TROUBLES AND THE LACK OF ROOM WE DECIDED TO FIND A FACTORY ELSEWHERE AND DECIDED TO TRY THE LOCOMOTIVE WORKS UP AT SCHENECTADY
FROM NOW UNTIL I AM SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE I EXPECT TO KEEP MORE OR LESS BUSY WITH MY REGULAR WORK NOT HOWEVER WORKING AS MANY HOURS OR AS HARD AS I HAVE IN THE PAST
UNDER THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF OPERATION A PLANT FURNISHING THE ELECTRIC POWER FOR STREET RAILWAYS MUST BE LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPLY CURRENT FOR THE MAXIMUM LOAD DURING RUSH HOURS ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE MACHINERY MAY BE LYING IDLE AND UNPRODUCTIVE IN THE HOURS OF MINIMUM LOAD
BUT WHO WE ASK WOULD HAVE HAD THE TEMERITY EVEN TO SUGGEST THAT SUCH AN ATTENUATED BODY COULD BE MAINTAINED AT A WHITE HEAT WITHOUT DISINTEGRATION FOR A THOUSAND HOURS
WHEN THE CYLINDER STOPS CURRENT ONCE MORE GOES TO THE PRESS-MAGNET AND THE OPERATION OF LIFTING AND PRINTING IS REPEATED
A NUMBER OF GRAIN WAREHOUSES OR PRIMITIVE ELEVATORS WERE BUILT ALONG THE BANK OF THE CANAL AND THE PRODUCE OF THE REGION POURED IN IMMEDIATELY ARRIVING IN WAGONS DRAWN BY FOUR OR SIX HORSES WITH LOADS OF A HUNDRED BUSHELS
THE TELEPHONE ON APRIL 27 1877 EDISON FILED IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE AN APPLICATION FOR A PATENT ON A TELEPHONE AND ON MAY 3 1892 MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS AFTERWARD PATENT NO
3 1882 430,933 FILAMENT FOR INCANDESCENT LAMPS
I POURED THESE REMNANTS INTO THE OTHER BARRELS SAT DOWN AND PULLED THE BARREL OVER MY HEAD BOTTOM UP
BISULPHIDE OF CARBON WAS FOUND TO DO IT INSTANTLY
AS TO THE KIND OF MISHAP THAT WAS WONT TO OCCUR EDISON TELLS THE FOLLOWING STORY
I HAD RECOURSE AGAIN SAYS EDISON TO THE PHENOMENON DISCOVERED BY ME YEARS PREVIOUS THAT THE FRICTION OF A RUBBING ELECTRODE PASSING OVER A MOIST CHALK SURFACE WAS VARIED BY ELECTRICITY
5 1881 446,667 LOCOMOTIVES FOR ELECTRIC RAILWAYS
BUT DIFFERENT AS ARE THE DYNAMOS OF TO-DAY FROM THOSE OF THE EARLIER PERIOD THEY EMBODY ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES AND ELEMENTS THAT EDISON THEN MARKED OUT AND ELABORATED AS THE CONDITIONS OF SUCCESS
THE NEXT BUILDING NO
AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS CENTRALIZING WAS ATTEMPTED IN MAY 1877 IN BOSTON WITH THE CIRCUITS OF THE HOLMES BURGLAR-ALARM SYSTEM FOUR BANKING-HOUSES BEING THUS INTERCONNECTED
CLEVELAND WOULD CALL FIRST ON MILWAUKEE IF HE HAD ANYTHING
HE MAY DROP THE SUBJECT FOR A TIME
THIS PIONEER SYSTEM WAS OPERATED CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL FEBRUARY 9 1900 OR FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS WHEN THE STURDY OLD MACHINES STILL IN EXCELLENT CONDITION WERE PUT OUT OF SERVICE SO THAT A LARGER PLANT COULD BE INSTALLED TO MEET THE DEMAND
JUST BEFORE I REACHED THE JUNCTION ANOTHER OUTPOUR OF BLACK MUD OCCURRED AND THE WHOLE ENGINE WAS A SIGHT--SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN I PULLED INTO THE YARD EVERYBODY TURNED TO SEE IT LAUGHING IMMODERATELY
NO ONE KNEW IF HE WAS BANKRUPT OR NOT EDISON IN THOSE DAYS RATHER LIKED THE MODEST COFFEE-SHOPS AND MENTIONS VISITING ONE
EDISON BARELY TWENTY-ONE YEARS OLD WAS A KEEN OBSERVER OF THE STIRRING EVENTS AROUND HIM
THE OLD SCOTCHMAN WAS ONE OF THE INNOCENT CHARTERED LIBERTINES OF THE PLACE WITH AN UNLIMITED STOCK OF GOOD JOKES AND STORIES BUT SELDOM OF ANY PRACTICAL USE
NOW TO-DAY I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU TO LUNCH WITH ME AND GIVE YOU THE FINEST LUNCH YOU EVER HAD WHEN WE ARRIVED IN HOBOKEN WE TOOK THE DOWNTOWN FERRY ACROSS THE HUDSON AND WHEN WE ARRIVED ON THE MANHATTAN SIDE MR EDISON LED THE WAY TO SMITH MCNELL'S OPPOSITE WASHINGTON MARKET AND WELL KNOWN TO OLD NEW YORKERS
28 1891 474,592 ORE-CONVEYING APPARATUS
HE NOW TURNED TO THE USE OF ALMOST INFUSIBLE METALS--SUCH AS BORON RUTHENIUM CHROMIUM ETC.--AS SEPARATORS OR TINY BRIDGES BETWEEN TWO CARBON POINTS THE CURRENT ACTING SO AS TO BRING THESE SEPARATORS TO A HIGH DEGREE OF INCANDESCENCE AT WHICH POINT THEY WOULD EMIT A BRILLIANT LIGHT
AND PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS DURING WHICH VARIOUS ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY OTHERS THAN EDISON TO PERFECT MAGNETIC SEPARATION AND BRING IT UP TO SOMETHING LIKE COMMERCIAL PRACTICE
LATER ON HE TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THE AFFAIRS AND INSTALLATIONS OF THE EDISON LIGHT COMPANY
FIG
THE MAIN PECULIARITIES OF MR EDISON'S AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH SHORTLY STATED IN CONCLUSION ARE
SIMPLE THOUGH THE PRINCIPLE APPEARS IT WAS IN ITS APPLICATION TO VAST MASSES OF MATERIAL AND IN THE SOLVING OF GREAT ENGINEERING PROBLEMS CONNECTED THEREWITH THAT EDISON'S ORIGINALITY MADE ITSELF MANIFEST IN THE CONCENTRATING WORKS THAT HE ESTABLISHED IN NEW JERSEY EARLY IN THE NINETIES
SO I DROPPED IT
HIS OFFICIAL REPORT CLOSES THUS
AT THE EDISON CONCENTRATING PLANT THE BROKEN ROCK AFTER PASSING THROUGH THESE ROLLS WAS FURTHER REDUCED IN SIZE BY OTHER ROLLS AND WAS THEN READY TO BE CRUSHED TO A FINE POWDER THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF ANOTHER REMARKABLE MACHINE DEVISED BY EDISON TO MEET HIS EVER-RECURRING AND WELL-DEFINED IDEAS OF THE UTMOST ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCY
BOYHOOD AT PORT HURON MICHIGAN IV
I WOULD GO OVER THE CORRESPONDENCE WITH EDISON SOMETIMES MAKING A MARGINAL NOTE IN SHORTHAND AND SOMETIMES EDISON WOULD MAKE HIS OWN NOTES ON LETTERS AND I WOULD BE EXPECTED TO CLEAN UP THE CORRESPONDENCE WITH EDISON'S LACONIC COMMENTS AS A GUIDE AS TO THE CHARACTER OF ANSWER TO MAKE
CONTINUING THESE EXPERIMENTS WITH MOST FERVENT ZEAL TAKING NO ACCOUNT OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME WITH AN UTTER DISREGARD FOR MEALS AND BUT SCANTY HOURS OF SLEEP SNATCHED RELUCTANTLY AT ODD PERIODS OF THE DAY OR NIGHT EDISON KEPT HIS LABORATORY GOING WITHOUT CESSATION
THE MARKETING ENTERPRISE WAS EARLY DOOMED TO FAILURE PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THE INSTRUMENTS WERE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD AND DID NOT POSSESS THE NECESSARY REFINEMENTS THAT WOULD FIT THEM FOR THE SPECIAL FIELD IN WHICH THEY WERE TO BE USED
589,168 ISSUED AUGUST 31 1897 REISSUED IN TWO PARTS--NAMELY NO
THE GROUP THAT TOOK PART IN THESE EARLY YEARS OF EDISON'S ARDUOUS LABORS INCLUDED HIS OLD-TIME ASSISTANT FRED OTT TOGETHER WITH HIS CHEMIST J
HE BROUGHT THREE DRAWINGS TO EDISON WHO EXAMINED THEM AND SAID NONE OF THEM WOULD ANSWER
AS I HAD OFTEN MADE THEM TOE THE SCRATCH FOR ONCE THEY WERE ONLY TOO WELL PLEASED TO HAVE ME TOE THE LINE FOR THEM
KRUESI WHEN HE HAD NEARLY FINISHED IT ASKED WHAT IT WAS FOR
THE AGONIES OF THE VICTIM ATTRACTED ATTENTION AND EDISON'S MOTHER MARKED HER DISPLEASURE BY AN APPLICATION OF THE SWITCH KEPT BEHIND THE OLD SETH THOMAS GRANDFATHER CLOCK THE DISASTROUS RESULT OF THIS EXPERIMENT DID NOT DISCOURAGE EDISON AT ALL AS HE ATTRIBUTED FAILURE TO THE LAD RATHER THAN TO THE MOTIVE POWER
AND THEN A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT HE CAME TO ME AGAIN AND SAID HE WAS ALL MIXED UP AND NOW FOUND THAT WE HAD MADE OVER $7000 EDISON CHANGED BOOKKEEPERS BUT NEVER THEREAFTER COUNTED ANYTHING REAL PROFIT UNTIL HE HAD PAID ALL HIS DEBTS AND HAD THE PROFITS IN THE BANK
SATURDAY 3.30 WENT HOME DISGUSTED WITH INCANDESCENT LAMPS THIS FEELING WAS EVIDENTLY EVANESCENT FOR ON THE SUCCEEDING MONDAY THE WORK WAS CONTINUED AND CARRIED ON BY HIM AS KEENLY AS BEFORE AS SHOWN BY THE NEXT BATCH OF NOTES
I REMEMBER ONE THAT HE LIKED TO GET OFF ON US ONCE IN A WHILE
EDISON AND HIS FRIENDS ARRIVED IN NEW ORLEANS JUST AT THE TIME OF THE GREAT RIOT WHEN SEVERAL HUNDRED NEGROES WERE KILLED AND THE CITY WAS IN THE HANDS OF A MOB
THREE LAMPS OF ONLY 2 BURNERS IN ALL
THE USE OF CARBON IN A TRANSMITTER IS BEYOND CONTROVERSY THE INVENTION OF EDISON
HE GOT ME ENTHUSED ON THE SUBJECT SO I STARTED IN TO SEE IF IT WERE NOT POSSIBLE TO DO THAT OPERATION BY MACHINERY
HE WAS NEARLY FROZEN AND HE ASKED IF HE MIGHT SIT BY THE STOVE
ADAMS SAYS THAT WHEN EDISON BROUGHT HOME THESE BOOKS AT 4 A.M
NEARBY WAS THE GASOLINE PLANT
MR LIEB HAS SINCE BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS AND THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES WHILE DOCTOR ACHESON HAS BEEN PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
ALL KNOWN METALS IN FORM OF SHEET ROD AND TUBE AND OF GREAT VARIETY IN THICKNESS ARE HERE FOUND ALSO TOGETHER WITH A MOST COMPLETE ASSORTMENT OF TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES FOR MACHINE SHOP AND LABORATORY WORK
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
TO 7 A.M AND TO INSURE ATTENTION WHILE ON DUTY IT IS OFTEN PROVIDED THAT THE OPERATOR EVERY HOUR FROM 9 P.M
AND ONE WHEEL HAD FRACTIONS
FINALLY HE NOTICED IT AND PUTTING HIS ARM THROUGH THE BARS OF THE WINDOW HE ESTABLISHED COMMUNICATION WITH ME
THIS HURT HIS PRIDE AND HE DETERMINED TO GET EVEN
ADAMS STAYED OVER IN EUROPE CONNECTED WITH THE TELEPHONE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND FINALLY DIED OF TOO MUCH WHISKEY--BUT NOT OF HEART-DISEASE
MR JEHL SAYS
A FULL VIEW OF THIS SHUTTER IS ALSO REPRESENTED WITH ITS OPENING D IN THE SMALL ILLUSTRATION TO THE RIGHT
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A THEORY WITH EDISON THAT WE SLEEP ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH
ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF REPRODUCTION FOR MANY YEARS WAS THE TROUBLE EXPERIENCED IN KEEPING THE STYLUS IN PERFECT ENGAGEMENT WITH THE WAVE-LIKE RECORD SO THAT EVERY MINUTE VIBRATION WOULD BE REPRODUCED
IT WILL BE APPARENT THAT THE ARRANGEMENT SHOWN IN FIG
GIANT CRANES 215 FEET LONG SPAN VERTICAL DRYER
MANY OF THE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THIS ARTICLE ARE REPRODUCED FROM AMERICAN TELEGRAPHY AND ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE TELEGRAPH BY WILLIAM MAVER JR BY PERMISSION OF MAVER PUBLISHING COMPANY NEW YORK EDISON MADE ANOTHER NOTABLE CONTRIBUTION TO MULTIPLEX TELEGRAPHY SOME YEARS LATER IN THE PHONOPLEX
ALTHOUGH THIS DEAFNESS WOULD BE REGARDED AS A GREAT AFFLICTION BY MOST PEOPLE AND HAS BROUGHT IN ITS TRAIN OTHER SERIOUS BAUBLES MR EDISON HAS ALWAYS REGARDED IT PHILOSOPHICALLY AND SAID ABOUT IT RECENTLY
IF THE SAME WIRE BE COILED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT BUT ONE-QUARTER OF ITS SURFACE RADIATES ITS TEMPERATURE WILL BE INCREASED FOUR TIMES WITH THE SAME BATTERY OR ONE-QUARTER OF THIS BATTERY WILL BRING IT TO THE TEMPERATURE OF STRAIGHT WIRE
THIS PARTICULAR BIT OF ACTING WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT EVEN IN THE COLDEST WEATHER HE WEARS THIN SUMMER CLOTHES GENERALLY ACID-WORN AND MORE OR LESS DISREPUTABLE
HE DID NOT AT THAT TIME HOWEVER ENGAGE IN A SERIOUS SEARCH FOR ANOTHER FORM OF STORAGE BATTERY BEING TREMENDOUSLY OCCUPIED WITH HIS LIGHTING SYSTEM AND OTHER MATTERS
IN SUCH CASES ONLY ONE PATENT CAN BE ISSUED AND THAT TO THE INVENTOR WHO ON THE TAKING OF TESTIMONY SHOWS PRIORITY IN DATE OF INVENTION
BOGOTA THE CAPITAL OF COLUMBIA IS REACHED ON MULEBACK--OR WAS--FROM HONDA ON THE HEADWATERS OF THE MAGDALENA RIVER
I MADE AN EXHIBITION OF THE JUMBO IN THE THEATRE AT SANTIAGO AND ON THE FIRST EVENING WHEN IT WAS FILLED WITH THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE CITY I DISCOVERED TO MY HORROR THAT THE BINDING WIRE AROUND THE ARMATURE WAS SLOWLY STRIPPING OFF AND GOING TO PIECES
WITH A LITTLE HANDFUL OF SELECTED EXPERIMENTERS GATHERED ABOUT HIM EDISON SETTLED DOWN TO ONE OF HIS CHARACTERISTIC STRUGGLES FOR SUPREMACY
WITH THIS IDEA CLEARLY IN MIND THE THEORY OF THE POLARIZED RELAY GENERALLY CALLED POLAR RELAY AS PRESENTED IN THE DIAGRAM FIG
HIS TRIP HAS BEEN ALREADY DESCRIBED
IN MAY 1881 I WAS ENGAGED BY MR M
3 THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SHUNT
THE FREIGHT-LOCOMOTIVE WAS NOT SO FAST BUT COULD PULL HEAVY TRAINS AT A GOOD SPEED
THUS THE RECORD WOULD BE FORMED ON THE TIN-FOIL IN A CONTINUOUS SPIRAL LINE
I SAVED SEVENTEEN YEARS OF WORRY BY THIS STROKE THUS MODESTLY IS TOLD THE DEBUT OF EDISON IN THE TELEPHONE ART TO WHICH WITH HIS CARBON TRANSMITTER HE GAVE THE VALUABLE PRINCIPLE OF VARYING THE RESISTANCE OF THE TRANSMITTING CIRCUIT WITH CHANGES IN THE PRESSURE AS WELL AS THE VITAL PRACTICE OF USING THE INDUCTION COIL AS A MEANS OF INCREASING THE EFFECTIVE LENGTH OF THE TALKING CIRCUIT
THE FRAME IS SLIT AT THE INNER HORIZONTAL EDGES AND THEN FOLDED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE INDIVIDUAL CLAMPING-JAWS FOR EACH END-FLANGE
BUT THE THIRD CATCHES THOSE TO WHICH ROCK ADHERES AND WILL EXTRACT PARTICLES OF WHICH ONLY ONE-EIGHTH IS IRON
I PUT THE EXPLOSIVE INTO A SARSAPARILLA BOTTLE TIED A STRING TO IT WRAPPED IT IN A PAPER AND GENTLY LET IT DOWN INTO THE SEWER CORNER OF STATE AND WASHINGTON STREETS THE ASSOCIATE IN THIS WAS A MAN WHOM HE HAD FOUND ENDEAVORING TO MAKE ELECTRICAL APPARATUS FOR SLEIGHT-OF-HAND PERFORMANCES
ON JULY 5TH--OWING TO THE BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR CEASELESS TOIL GIVEN BY A PUBLIC HOLIDAY--THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE OPERATIVE PART OF THE STATION WAS SO FAR COMPLETED THAT THE FIRST OF THE DYNAMOS WAS OPERATED UNDER STEAM
GUM ARABIC 5 LBS
INSTEAD OF PUNCHING MORSE CHARACTERS IN THE TRANSMISSION TAPE HOWEVER IT WAS PERFORATED WITH A SERIES OF SMALL ROUND HOLES FORMING ROMAN LETTERS
I CAN SAY IN ALL TRUTH AND JUSTICE THAT THEIR TESTIMONY WAS UTTERLY FALSE AND THAT THE LAWYERS WHO TOOK IT MUST HAVE KNOWN IT
IF IN THE FOREGOING PAGES THERE HAS APPEARED TO BE A TENDENCY TO ATTRIBUTE TO EDISON THE ENTIRE CREDIT FOR THE GROWTH TO WHICH MANY OF THE ABOVE-NAMED GREAT ENTERPRISES HAVE IN THESE LATTER DAYS ATTAINED WE MUST ESPECIALLY DISCLAIM ANY INTENTION OF GIVING RISE TO SUCH A DEDUCTION
NOW NOT ONE OF THESE MISCELLANEOUS THINGS WAS IN EXISTENCE
WHAT HE MAY DESCEND TO LATER CANNOT BE KNOWN
IT MAY BE ADDED THAT IN ADDITION TO THE TWO QUARTS OF MEDALS UP AT THE HOUSE THERE WILL BE FOUND AT GLENMONT MANY OTHER SIGNAL TOKENS OF ESTEEM AND GOOD-WILL--A BEAUTIFUL CIGAR-CASE FROM THE LATE TSAR OF RUSSIA BRONZES FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN STEEL TROPHIES FROM KRUPP AND A HOST OF OTHER MEMENTOS TO ONE OF WHICH HE THUS REFERS
BY REASON OF THIS BOTH THE ELEMENT AND THE ELECTROLYTE THAT HAVE BEEN USED UP MUST BE RENEWED FROM TIME TO TIME IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A CONTINUED SUPPLY OF ELECTRIC CURRENT
HUGHES WHO WAS WORKING ON THE EXPERIMENTAL ROAD WITH MR EDISON TELLS THE FOLLOWING STORY
DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE PANIC OF 1893 THERE CAME A PERIOD WHEN WE WERE VERY HARD UP FOR READY CASH DUE LARGELY TO THE PANICKY CONDITIONS
WHATEVER IS FINE ENOUGH GOES THROUGH TO THE EIGHT-INCH MAGNETS AND THE REMAINDER GOES BACK FOR RECRUSHING
THE EDISON POURED OR CAST CEMENT HOUSE MAY BE RECKONED AS A REALITY
19 1882 492,150 COATING CONDUCTORS FOR INCANDESCENT LAMPS
EDISON A HALF-BROTHER OF EDISON'S FATHER AND A MAN OF MARKED INVENTIVE ABILITY
THE ONLY THINGS THAT I EVER COULD GET WERE COFFEE MADE FROM BURNT BREAD WITH BROWN MOLASSES-CAKE
KNOWING THAT MR EDISON HAD HAD AN EXPERIENCE LASTING TWO OR THREE YEARS WITH THIS PARTICULAR MAKE OF CAR I DETERMINED TO ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION RELATIVE TO REPAIR PARTS
FOR WHEREAS THE PREVIOUS EFFICIENCY HAD BEEN 18 PER CENT
IT WILL BE SEEN THEREFORE THAT THIS METHOD OF DUPLEXING IS PRACTICED NOT BY VARYING THE STRENGTH OR POLARITY BUT BY SENDING TWO KINDS OF CURRENT OVER THE WIRE
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO I HAD A MOTOR-CAR OF A MAKE OF WHICH MR EDISON HAD ALREADY TWO CARS
DURABILITY OF MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION
AND THE FIRST TO COMBINE SUCH A BURNER WITH THE NECESSARY ADJUNCTS OF LAMP CONSTRUCTION TO PREVENT ITS DISINTEGRATION AND GIVE IT SUFFICIENTLY LONG LIFE
IT IS SAID THAT SUCH SIGNALS WERE ALSO INTERCHANGED BY MILITARY TELEGRAPHERS DURING THE WAR AND POSSIBLY EDISON MAY HAVE HEARD OF THE PRACTICE
THIS WAS A REDUCTION FROM $23.24 PER LAMP FOR COPPER TO $3.72 PER LAMP
ITS PECULIARITY CONSISTS IN THE FACT THAT THE SIGNALS ARE TRANSMITTED IN ONE DIRECTION BY REVERSING THE POLARITY OF A CONSTANT CURRENT AND IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION BY INCREASING OR DECREASING THE STRENGTH OF THE SAME CURRENT HEREIN LAY THE GERM OF THE EDISON QUADRUPLEX
EACH FIRM HAD ITS OWN ARMY OF BOYS NUMBERING FROM TWELVE TO FIFTEEN WHOSE DUTIES WERE TO ASCERTAIN THE LATEST QUOTATIONS FROM THE DIFFERENT EXCHANGES
BUT IF THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE ROSE ABOVE A PREDETERMINED AMOUNT BY ONE OR TWO VOLTS THE RED LAMP LIGHTED UP AND THE ATTENDANT AT THE HAND-WHEEL OF THE FIELD REGULATOR INSERTED RESISTANCE IN THE FIELD CIRCUIT WHEREAS IF THE BLUE LAMP LIGHTED RESISTANCE WAS CUT OUT UNTIL THE PRESSURE WAS RAISED TO NORMAL
IN 1860 JUST BEFORE THE WAR BROKE OUT THERE CAME TO THE TRAIN ONE AFTERNOON IN DETROIT TWO FINE-LOOKING YOUNG MEN ACCOMPANIED BY A COLORED SERVANT
AND THAT IS ABOUT THE CONDITION IN WHICH MY BROTHER DUNCAN AND MY FRIEND CLARKE WERE AT THE END OF THIS EXAMINATION MR DUNCAN--"I NOTICE ON THE REDIRECT THAT MR CLARKE CHANGED HIS COLOR MR LOWREY--"WELL PERHAPS HE WAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF A ROACH THEN
WE HAVE SEEN THE MINERAL AND VEGETABLE KINGDOMS RIFLED AND RANSACKED FOR SUBSTANCES THAT WOULD YIELD THE BEST FILAMENT WE HAVE HAD THE VAGUE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ASSISTING AT A GREAT DEVELOPMENT WHOSE EVIDENCES TO-DAY ON EVERY HAND ATTEST ITS MAGNITUDE
AT THIS POINT A GATE-HOUSE WAS PROVIDED AND PUT IN CHARGE OF A KEEPER FOR THEN AS AT THE PRESENT TIME EDISON WAS GREATLY SOUGHT AFTER
ARTICULATION WHISPERING AND WHISTLING GOOD
YET THE VERY VOGUE OF THE ELECTRIC ARC LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
THE BELL OF THE LOCOMOTIVE WAS EVERYWHERE RINGING THE DEATH-KNELL OF EFFECTIVE WATER HAULAGE WITH SUCH DIRE RESULTS THAT IN 1880 OF THE 4468 MILES OF AMERICAN FREIGHT CANAL THAT HAD COST $214,000,000 NO FEWER THAN 1893 MILES HAD BEEN ABANDONED AND OF THE REMAINING 2575 MILES QUITE A LARGE PROPORTION WAS NOT PAYING EXPENSES
MEANTIME THE SADDENED AND PERPLEXED AUTOMATIC GROUP WAS LEFT UNPAID AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1906 ON A BILL FILED NEARLY THIRTY YEARS BEFORE THAT JUDGE HAZEL IN THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOUND STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE CLAIMANTS AND ORDERED AN ACCOUNTING
ON THE INSIDE OF THIS IS SPREAD A LAYER OF TUNGSTATE OF CALCIUM
IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THESE REFERENCES CAN BE BUT OF THE MOST MEAGRE KIND AND MUST BE REGARDED AS MERELY THROWING A SIDE-LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT ITSELF

THIS PECULIAR COINCIDENCE OF SIMULTANEOUS BUT SEPARATE WORK NOT ONLY COMES TO LIGHT ON THE BRINGING OUT OF GREAT AND IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES OR INVENTIONS BUT BECOMES MORE APPARENT IF A NEW ART IS DISCLOSED FOR THEN THE IMAGINATION OF PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTERS IS STIMULATED THROUGH WIDE DISSEMINATION OF THE TIDINGS SOMETIMES RESULTING IN MORE OR LESS EFFORT TO ENTER THE NEWLY OPENED FIELD WITH DEVICES OR METHODS THAT RESEMBLE CLOSELY THE ORIGINAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ONES IN PRINCIPLE AND APPLICATION
MANY OF THE OLD OPERATORS TAKEN ON OUT OF GOOD-NATURE WERE POOR EXHIBITORS AND WORSE ACCOUNTANTS AND AT LAST THEY AND THE MACHINES WITH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN INTRUSTED FADED FROM SIGHT
WERE PAID EASILY ON THAT SUM ALSO

HOLDING A KNIFE IN THE OTHER HAND WE DREW SPARKS FROM THE STOVE-PIPE
ALTHOUGH AS WE HAVE SEEN IN A PREVIOUS PART OF THIS BOOK HIS EARLIEST FAME AROSE FROM HIS GREAT PRACTICAL WORK IN TELEGRAPHIC INVENTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS THERE IS NO WAY IN WHICH ANY DEFINITE COMPUTATION CAN BE MADE OF THE VALUE OF HIS CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE ART EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THE CASE OF HIS QUADRUPLEX THROUGH WHICH ALONE IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE HAS BEEN SAVED FROM $15,000,000 TO $20,000,000 IN THE COST OF LINE CONSTRUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY
ONE NIGHT OR ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING A POLICEMAN CAME IN AND SAID THAT SOMETHING HAD EXPLODED AT THE CORNER OF WILLIAM AND NASSAU STREETS
HENCE IF VACANCIES OCCUR THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPERATORS AVAILABLE AND SALARIES HAVE REMAINED SO LOW AS TO LEAD TO ONE OR TWO FORMIDABLE AND COSTLY STRIKES THAT UNFORTUNATELY TOOK NO ACCOUNT OF THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF DEMAND AND SUPPLY

EDISON BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES POSSIBLE IN THE EMPLOYMENT OF HIS STORAGE BATTERY FOR STREET-CAR PROPULSION
MR EDISON HAD COMPLETELY GRASPED THE EFFECT OF SUBDIVISION OF CIRCUITS AND THE INFLUENCE OF WIRES LEADING TO SUCH SUBDIVISIONS WHEN IT WAS MOST DIFFICULT TO EXPRESS WHAT HE KNEW IN TECHNICAL LANGUAGE
BUT AS WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SEEN THIS SACRIFICE WAS IN TIME RENDERED UNNECESSARY
PROFESSOR HUGHES SPENT AN AFTERNOON IN EXAMINING THE APPARATUS AND IN ABOUT A MONTH CAME OUT WITH HIS MICROPHONE WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN MY EXACT INVENTION

28 1882 438,298 MANUFACTURE OF INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
AND HENCE THE CONCLUSION THAT CARBON CONTAINED IN ITSELF THE ELEMENTS OF ITS OWN DESTRUCTION AND WAS NOT A SUITABLE MATERIAL FOR THE BURNER OF AN INCANDESCENT LAMP
THE MOLDS ARE MADE OF CAST-IRON IN SECTIONS OF SUCH SIZE AND WEIGHT AS WILL BE MOST CONVENIENT FOR HANDLING MOSTLY IN PIECES NOT EXCEEDING TWO BY FOUR FEET IN RECTANGULAR DIMENSIONS
AFTER MY RETURN FROM THE TRIP TO OBSERVE THE ECLIPSE OF THE SUN I WENT WITH PROFESSOR BARKER PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AND DOCTOR CHANDLER PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY IN COLUMBIA COLLEGE TO SEE MR WALLACE A LARGE MANUFACTURER OF BRASS IN ANSONIA CONNECTICUT
IT HAS BEEN SAID OF ME THAT MY METHODS ARE EMPIRICAL

BUT PAYMENTS WERE THEN STOPPED AND THE OTHER OWNERS WERE LEFT WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION ALTHOUGH ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM IN THE SHAPE OF PROPERTY AND PATENTS WAS TAKEN OVER BODILY INTO ATLANTIC PACIFIC HANDS AND NEVER AGAIN LEFT THEM
MOST OF THE MEN ADJOURNED TO THIS STRAW VERY SICK
EDISON HAD READ ABOUT BEARS BUT COULDN'T REMEMBER WHETHER THEY WERE DAY OR NIGHT PROWLERS
I PROTESTED AT THE RATE OF SPEED OVER THE SHARP CURVES DESIGNED TO SHOW THE POWER OF THE ENGINE BUT EDISON SAID THEY HAD DONE IT OFTEN
WE DO NOT EVEN KNOW DEFINITELY HOW SHAKESPEARE'S AND GOLDSMITH'S PLAYS WERE PRONOUNCED ON THE STAGE IN THE THEATRES OF THE TIME
WAS A MIGHTY HIT AND THE WORLD WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT
THIS IS A HUGE SCREEN OR CURTAIN WHICH MAY BE DRAWN DOWN TO THE FLOOR TO PROVIDE A MEANS OF PROJECTION FOR LANTERN SLIDES OR MOTION PICTURES FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OR INSTRUCTION OF EDISON AND HIS GUESTS
THERE WAS ABOUT FOUR INCHES OF SOAP IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TUB FOURTEEN INCHES HIGH

THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE PIONEERS OF INCANDESCENT LIGHTING WHO WERE CONTINUOUSLY AT THE SIDE OF EDISON DAY AND NIGHT FOR SOME YEARS AND WHO UNDER HIS GUIDANCE WORKED UPON THE CARBON-FILAMENT LAMP FROM ITS BIRTH TO RIPE MATURITY
THE PRINCIPAL UNITED STATES PATENT ON THE LONG KILN WAS ISSUED OCTOBER 24 1905 NO
OLD PLANTS ARE LENGTHENING THEIR KILNS WHEREVER PRACTICABLE AND NO WIDE-AWAKE MANUFACTURER BUILDING A MODERN PLANT COULD AFFORD TO INSTALL OTHER THAN THESE LONG KILNS
HE HAD NO SENSE OF HUMOR
A LITTLE LATER THE EDISON ELECTRIC RAILWAY WAS BUILT ON THE CONFINES OF THE PROPERTY OUT THROUGH THE WOODS AT FIRST ONLY A THIRD OF A MILE IN LENGTH BUT REACHING ULTIMATELY TO PUMPTOWN ALMOST THREE MILES AWAY
SECOND FOR INSTRUCTION IN LANGUAGES
A LITTLE WAY FROM THIS TABLE AND SEPARATED BY A PARTITION WE HAD THE CHEMICAL LABORATORY WITH ITS FURNACES AND STINK-CHAMBERS
I ASKED HIM IF HE COULD RUN THE SHOP
HE WAS TRUE TO AN IDEAL AS TO THE POLE-STAR BUT WAS INCESSANTLY MAKING IMPROVEMENTS IN EVERY DIRECTION
I RESIGNED SOONER THAN JOHNSON EXPECTED AND HE HAD ME ON HIS HANDS
I SENT A MAN TO SOUTH AMERICA TO FIND WHAT I WANT
THUS MR EDISON'S EARLY CONCEPTIONS OF THE NECESSITIES OF A COMPLETE SYSTEM ONE OF THEM MADE EVEN IN ADVANCE OF PRACTICE HAVE STOOD FIRM UNIMPROVED AND UNCHANGED DURING THE PAST TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS A PERIOD OF TIME WHICH HAS WITNESSED MORE WONDERFUL AND RAPID PROGRESS IN ELECTRICAL SCIENCE AND ART THAN HAS BEEN KNOWN DURING ANY SIMILAR ART OR PERIOD OF TIME SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN
THE NICKEL HYDRATE WAS A POOR ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR AND ALTHOUGH A METALLIC NICKEL POCKET MIGHT BE FILLED WITH IT THERE WOULD NOT BE THE DESIRED ELECTRICAL ACTION UNLESS A CONDUCTING SUBSTANCE WERE MIXED WITH IT AND SO INCORPORATED AND PACKED THAT THERE WOULD BE GOOD ELECTRICAL CONTACT THROUGHOUT
I SENT MEN OUT AND CULLED TWO QUARTS OF BUGS AND TRIED EVERY CHEMICAL I HAD TO DESTROY THEM
BERGMANN HAD WON ALL THE MONEY AND WHEN THE PORTER CAME IN AND SAID CHICAGO BERGMANN JUMPED UP AND SAID
CHAPTER XIII A WORLD-HUNT FOR FILAMENT MATERIAL IN WRITING ABOUT THE OLD EXPERIMENTING DAYS AT MENLO PARK MR F
THE FIELD BEING A NEW ONE TO HIM EDISON FOLLOWED HIS USUAL COURSE OF READING UP EVERY PAGE OF AUTHORITATIVE LITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT AND SEEKING INFORMATION FROM ALL QUARTERS
THE NEXT IMMEDIATE STEP WAS A FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE CARBON FILAMENT
THERE IS ALWAYS TOO MUCH DANGER OF NEGLECTING THOUGHTS FOR THINGS IDEAS FOR MACHINERY
THE EFFECT TO THE EYE--NOT KNOWING OF THIS LITTLE BY-PLAY--IS AS IF SHE HAD INSTANTLY APPEARED FROM SPACE
THE EXCITEMENT OVER THE PHONOGRAPH WAS MAINTAINED FOR MANY MONTHS UNTIL A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY HAD SEEN IT
FINALLY I PUT A ROPE TO MY TRUNK WHICH WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A CARPENTER'S CHEST AND STARTED TO PULL THIS FROM THE BAGGAGE-CAR TO THE PASSENGER-CAR
BUT ITS CHIEF DISTINCTION LIES IN ITS BEING ONE OF HIS FAVORITE HAUNTS AND IN THE FACT THAT WITHIN ITS WALLS HAVE BEEN SETTLED MANY OF THE PERPLEXING PROBLEMS AND MOMENTOUS QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT GREAT CHANGES IN ELECTRICAL AND ENGINEERING ARTS DURING THE TWENTY-ODD YEARS THAT HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE ORANGE LABORATORY WAS BUILT
JUNE 1 1874 166,861 CHEMICAL TELEGRAPHY
THESE PATENTS ARE BETWEEN FIFTY AND SIXTY IN NUMBER AND INCLUDE MAGNETIC ORE SEPARATORS OF TEN DISTINCT TYPES
AND ALTHOUGH THE LARGER MATTERS HAVE CONTRIBUTED MOST TO THE HISTORY OF THE ARTS THE SAME CAREFULNESS OF THOUGHT HAS OFTEN BEEN THE MEANS OF LEADING TO IMPROVEMENTS OF PERMANENT ADVANTAGE EVEN IN MINOR DETAILS
IT WOULD BE MANIFESTLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE EXACT FIGURES OF SUCH A GIGANTIC AND SWIFTLY MOVING INDUSTRY WHOSE TOTALS INCREASE FROM WEEK TO WEEK
THIS HOWEVER DID NOT HINDER HIM FROM MAKING A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WHICH RESULTED IN AN INVENTION THAT PROVED CONCLUSIVELY THE CONTRARY HAVING CONCEIVED SOME NEW IDEA AND READ EVERYTHING OBTAINABLE RELATING TO THE SUBJECT IN GENERAL EDISON'S FERTILITY OF RESOURCE AND ORIGINALITY COME INTO PLAY
PEOPLE WHO COME IN CONTACT WITH HIM AND WHO MAY HAVE OCCASION TO OPPOSE HIS VIEWS MAY LEAVE WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT HE IS HOT-TEMPERED
ACCORDING TO THE FAMILY RECORDS THIS EDISON GREAT-GRANDFATHER OF THOMAS ALVA REACHED THE EXTREME OLD AGE OF 104 YEARS
BOEHM NOT FORGETTING THAT GOOD FRIEND AND CO-WORKER THE LATE JOHN KRUESI
HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT AFTER WEIGHING THE PLATES HE WENT AND PUT THEM IN THE CUSTOMER'S METER
LATER ON THIS PRIMITIVE INDICATOR WAS SUPPLANTED BY THE BRADLEY BRIDGE A CRUDE FORM OF THE HOWELL PRESSURE INDICATORS WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENTLY USED FOR MANY YEARS IN THE EDISON STATIONS
IT REQUIRED A PECULIAR EFFORT OF THE MIND SUCH AS THE IMAGINING OF EIGHT DIFFERENT THINGS MOVING SIMULTANEOUSLY ON A MENTAL PLANE WITHOUT ANYTHING TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR EFFICIENCY IT IS PERHAPS HARDLY TO BE WONDERED AT THAT WHEN NOTIFIED HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY 12 1/2 PER CENT
AN ELECTRIC LAMP ANSWERING CERTAIN SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS WOULD INDEED BE THE KEY TO THE SITUATION BUT ITS COMMERCIAL ADAPTATION REQUIRED A MULTIFARIOUS VARIETY OF APPARATUS AND DEVICES

THE PLASTERING WAS ABOUT ONE-THIRD GONE FROM THE CEILING
THERE WERE NO PRECEDENTS NOTHING UPON WHICH TO BUILD OR IMPROVE
THE LAMPS AT THAT TIME WERE COSTING ABOUT $1.25 EACH TO MAKE SO I SAID TO THE COMPANY
THIS SMALL SUM OF MONEY REPRESENTED BOTH FOOD AND LODGING UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WORK COULD BE OBTAINED
THIS OFFICE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY BUSY TAKING FROM $50 TO $75 A MONTH BUT EVEN THE MESSAGES TAKEN IN WOULD REMAIN UNSENT ON THE HOOK WHILE EDISON WAS IN THE CELLAR BELOW TRYING TO SOLVE SOME CHEMICAL PROBLEM
JENKS W
FOR A MINUTE COLONEL BAILEY DID NOT RECALL WHAT WAS REFERRED TO
EDISON WATCHED CLOSELY ALL THIS EARLIER DEVELOPMENT FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS NOT CHANGING HIS MIND AS TO WHAT HE REGARDED AS THE INCURABLE DEFECTS OF THE LEAD-LEAD TYPE BUT COMING GRADUALLY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF A STORAGE BATTERY OF SOME OTHER AND BETTER TYPE COULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD IT WOULD FULFIL ALL THE EARLY HOPES HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT OF SUCH MEN AS KELVIN SIR WILLIAM THOMSON AND WOULD BECOME AS NECESSARY AND AS UNIVERSAL AS THE INCANDESCENT LAMP OR THE ELECTRIC MOTOR
THE NEXT MORNING I WAS SUMMONED BEFORE HIM AND TOLD THAT WHAT THE COMPANY WANTED WAS OPERATORS NOT EXPERIMENTERS
23 1901 704,304 REVERSIBLE GALVANIC BATTERY
VARIOUS EXPEDIENTS TO PREVENT OXIDIZATION WERE TRIED SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS COATING THE CARBON WITH POWDERED GLASS WHICH IN MELTING WOULD PROTECT THE CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE BUT WITHOUT SUCCESSFUL RESULTS
IN ALL THE LITIGATION WHICH HAS RESULTED FROM THE WIDE-SPREAD INFRINGEMENTS OF THE EDISON PATENTS MR LOWREY HAS EVER BORNE THE BURDEN AND HEAT OF THE DAY AND PERHAPS IN NO OTHER FIELD HAS HE SO PERSONALLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS IN THE SUCCESSFUL ADVOCACY OF THE CLAIMS OF EDISON TO THE INVENTION OF THE INCANDESCENT LAMP AND EVERYTHING HEREUNTO PERTAINING THIS WAS THE MAN OF WHOM EDISON HAD NECESSARILY TO MAKE A CONFIDANT AND ADVISER AND WHO SUPPLIED OTHER THINGS BESIDES THE LEGAL DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL ALLIANCE BY HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD AND OF AFFAIRS
HIS TERSE COMMENT ON MY REPORT WAS
THE EDISON ELECTRIC ILLUMINATING COMPANY WAS APPLYING FOR A FRANCHISE AND THE ALDERMEN FOR LACK OF SCIENTIFIC TRAINING AND SPECIFIC PRACTICAL INFORMATION WERE VERY SCEPTICAL ON THE SUBJECT--AS INDEED THEY MIGHT WELL BE
HE COMPELLED THE DESIGN OF THE SUCCESSFUL ENGINE
IN THE TEXT-BOOKS OF THE PERIOD IT WAS STATED AS A SETTLED PRINCIPLE THAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE MAXIMUM WORK OUT OF A SET OF BATTERIES THE INTERNAL RESISTANCE MUST APPROXIMATELY EQUAL THE RESISTANCE OF THE EXTERIOR CIRCUIT
IN PRACTICE THE OPERATION WOULD BE SOMEWHAT AS FOLLOWS GENERALLY SPEAKING
EDISON'S ELECTROMOTOGRAPH COMPRISED AN INGENIOUSLY ARRANGED APPARATUS IN WHICH TWO SURFACES NORMALLY IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER WERE CAUSED TO ALTERNATELY ADHERE BY FRICTION OR SLIP BY REASON OF ELECTROCHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION
IT WAS THE TOUGHEST KIND OF RESTAURANT EVER SEEN
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED HOWEVER THAT THE SUMS MENTIONED ABOVE REPRESENT INDUSTRIES OPERATED BY GREAT AGGREGATIONS OF CAPITAL WHILE THE ORANGE VALLEY PLANT AS WELL AS THE EDISON PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY WITH AN AVERAGE DAILY NUMBER OF 530 EMPLOYEES AND OVER $400,000 ANNUAL PAY-ROLL REPRESENT IN A LARGE MEASURE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE MORE IN THE NATURE OF CLOSELY HELD ENTERPRISES AND PRACTICALLY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF ONE MIND
THE OPERA-HOUSE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO BE LIGHTED BY THE INCANDESCENT LAMP AND THE MANAGERS TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN SHOWING ME DOWN THROUGH THE LABYRINTH CONTAINING THE WIRING DYNAMOS ETC
AND THEN PROCEEDED TO THE DESPATCHER'S OFFICE
HERE IS SEEN ALSO FURTHER PROOF OF THE GREAT TRUTH THAT ONE INVENTION OFTEN WAITS FOR ANOTHER
HENCE THE INTERIOR OF THE KILN MAY BE CONSIDERED AS BEING DIVIDED LONGITUDINALLY INTO TWO PARTS OR ZONES--NAMELY THE COMBUSTION OR CLINKERING ZONE AND THE ZONE OF ONCOMING RAW MATERIAL
HOWEVER IT WAS FINISHED THE FOIL WAS PUT ON
IDEAS AND EXPEDIENTS ARE POURED FORTH IN A TORRENT AND ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM HAVE TEMPORARILY APPEARED TO THE STAFF TO BE RIDICULOUS OR IRRELEVANT THEY HAVE FREQUENTLY TURNED OUT TO BE THE ONES LEADING TO A CORRECT SOLUTION OF THE TROUBLE
THESE DETAILS SHOW FORCIBLY AND TYPICALLY THE PAINFUL STEPS OF ADVANCE THAT EVERY INVENTOR IN THIS NEW FIELD HAD TO MAKE IN THE EFFORT TO REACH NOT ALONE COMMERCIAL PRACTICABILITY BUT MECHANICAL FEASIBILITY
IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE SECRET OF IT MIGHT BE THAT HE DID NOT LIVE IN THE PAST BUT WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FORWARD TO A GREATER FUTURE TO WHICH HE REPLIED
HE OPENED THE PACKAGE SHOWING THE BOOKS SOMEWHAT TO THE DISGUST OF THE OFFICER WHO IMAGINED HE HAD CAUGHT A BURGLAR SNEAKING AWAY IN THE DARK ALLEY WITH HIS BOOTY
AND THUS CAME TO ENJOY AN ANNUAL INCOME OF SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR SOME YEARS BASED CHIEFLY ON ITS MODEST INVESTMENT IN EDISON'S WORK
WHEN THE EXPERIMENTS ENDED EDISON'S SYSTEM WAS PUT INTO REGULAR COMMERCIAL OPERATION BETWEEN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON
AFTER A VERY SHORT TRIAL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO CREATE A SEPARATE ORGANIZATION FOR THIS BRANCH OF THE INDUSTRY LEAVING THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY TO CONTINUE UNDER THE ORIGINAL PLAN OF OPERATION AS A PARENT PATENT-HOLDING AND LICENSING COMPANY
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE KEY IS CONNECTED TO THE TRANSMITTING BATTERY WHILE THE OPPOSITE POLE OF THIS BATTERY IS CONNECTED IN THE BUZZER CIRCUIT
MUCH NONSENSE HAS BEEN TALKED IN RELATION TO THIS SUBJECT
THAT LIFE IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN HEREDITY IS VERY FAR FROM FINISHED

SUBSEQUENTLY AFTER MORE OR LESS EXPERIENCE THESE PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN VERIFIED AND I CANNOT HELP COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE HAS A FACULTY NOT POSSESSED BY THE AVERAGE MORTAL OF INTUITIVELY AND CORRECTLY SIZING UP MECHANICAL AND COMMERCIAL POSSIBILITIES
HE DIED BEFORE THAT TOOK PLACE
AT THAT TIME I WAS GETTING OUT PLANS TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE OF THREE HUNDRED HORSE-POWER WITH SIX-FOOT DRIVERS WITH THE IDEA OF SHOWING PEOPLE THAT THEY COULD DISPENSE WITH THEIR STEAM LOCOMOTIVES
I REMEMBER HOW EXTRAORDINARILY I WAS IMPRESSED WITH HIM ON THIS ACCOUNT AS I HAD JUST COME FROM A CIRCLE OF PEOPLE IN LONDON WHO NOT ONLY QUESTIONED THE POSSIBILITY OF THE SUCCESS OF EDISON'S INVENTION BUT OFTEN EXPRESSED DOUBT AS TO WHETHER THE WORK HE HAD DONE COULD BE CALLED AN INVENTION AT ALL
THE WORD LABORATORY HAD ALWAYS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ALCHEMISTS IN THE PAST BUT AS WITH FILAMENT THIS UNTUTORED STRIPLING APPLIED AN ICONOCLASTIC PRACTICABILITY TO IT LONG BEFORE HE REALIZED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NEW DEPARTURE

THERE IS ONE MORE INDUSTRY THOUGH OF COMPARATIVELY SMALL EXTENT THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ORANGE WORKS NAMELY THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF THE BATES NUMBERING MACHINE
IN 1847 TOO RUSSIA BEGAN HER TREMENDOUS MARCH EASTWARD INTO CENTRAL ASIA JUST AS FRANCE WAS SOLIDIFYING HER FIRST GAINS ON THE LITTORAL OF NORTHERN AFRICA
WHILE SOME OF THESE PATENTS ESPECIALLY THE EARLIER ONES COVER SPECIFIC DEVICES EMBODYING FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THAT NOT ONLY SURVIVE TO THE PRESENT DAY BUT ACTUALLY LIE AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE ART AS IT NOW EXISTS THERE IS NO REVELATION THEREIN OF EDISON'S PRECEDING STUDIES OF MAGNETS WHICH EXTENDED OVER MANY YEARS NOR OF HIS LATER SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATIONS AND DEDUCTIONS
ALL THESE NOTES REFER SPECIFICALLY TO ELECTRICITY VS

WHEN I GOT THE JOB THE CABLE ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER AT COVINGTON CONNECTING WITH THE LINE TO LOUISVILLE HAD A VARIABLE LEAK IN IT WHICH CAUSED THE STRENGTH OF THE SIGNALLING CURRENT TO MAKE VIOLENT FLUCTUATIONS
THE DUPLICATES MUST BE MICROSCOPICALLY IDENTICAL WITH THE ORIGINAL THEY MUST BE FREE FROM FALSE VIBRATIONS OR OTHER DEFECTS ALTHOUGH BOTH ORIGINAL AND DUPLICATES ARE OF SUCH EASILY DEFACABLE MATERIAL AS WAX

WHAT DO YOU WANT WORK CAN YOU MAKE THIS MACHINE WORK EXHIBITING IT AND EXPLAINING ITS DETAILS YES ARE YOU SURE WELL YOU NEEDN'T PAY ME IF I DON'T AND THUS MR OTT WENT TO WORK AND SUCCEEDED IN ACCOMPLISHING THE RESULTS DESIRED

WE STAYED A COUPLE OF HOURS AND GOUNOD SANG AND PLAYED FOR US
TO IMPROVE THE ILLUMINATION TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO MEET ALL REQUIREMENTS OF NATURAL ARTIFICIAL AND COMMERCIAL CONDITIONS A LARGE PROGRAMME BUT FULLY EXECUTED
IT WAS JUST AFTER CORBETT HAD WON ONE OF HIS BIG BATTLES AS A PRIZE-FIGHTER AND THE DISMAY OF HIS OPPONENT WAS EXCUSABLE
AS A MOTOR IT WAS WOUND TO RUN AT MAXIMUM SPEED TO DEVELOP A TORQUE EQUAL TO ABOUT FIFTEEN HORSE-POWER WITH 220 VOLTS
THEN HE WOULD GO OFF TO THE STATION BUILDING IN PEARL STREET THROW AN OVERCOAT ON A PILE OF TUBES LIE DOWN AND SLEEP FOR A FEW HOURS RISING TO RESUME WORK WITH THE FIRST GANG
IT WAS THEN DETERMINED TO PURCHASE NO MORE MR SHEPARD WENT ON TO STATE THAT THE CHEMICAL METERS WERE GRADUALLY DISPLACED AND THAT ON SEPTEMBER 1 1898 THERE WERE ON THE SYSTEM 5619 MECHANICAL AND 4874 CHEMICAL
EACH LIGHT TO GIVE A USEFUL AND ECONOMICAL DEGREE OF ILLUMINATION
BY NOW ENGAGING THE POINT WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE GROOVED RECORD SO FORMED AND BY AGAIN ROTATING THE CYLINDER THE UNDULATIONS OF THE RECORD WOULD CAUSE THE NEEDLE AND ITS ATTACHED DIAPHRAGM TO VIBRATE SO AS TO EFFECT THE REPRODUCTION
HE BLAMED ME INSTINCTIVELY AS THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE
THE FIRST UNISON ON STOCK TICKERS WAS ONE USED ON THE LAWS PRINTER
THE FACT REMAINS HOWEVER THAT FOR NEARLY NINE YEARS ALL EDISON LAMPS MANY MILLIONS IN THE AGGREGATE WERE MADE WITH BAMBOO FILAMENTS AND MANY OF THEM FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THAT UNTIL BAMBOO WAS FINALLY ABANDONED IN THE EARLY NINETIES EXCEPT FOR USE IN A FEW SPECIAL TYPES WHICH WERE SO MADE UNTIL ABOUT THE END OF 1908
IT MAY BE OBSERVED PARENTHETICALLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LAY READER THAT IN TELEGRAPHY THE DEVICE KNOWN AS THE RELAY IS A RECEIVING INSTRUMENT CONTAINING AN ELECTROMAGNET ADAPTED TO RESPOND TO THE WEAK LINE-CURRENT
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE ADDING OF A SECOND DYNAMO ARE THUS HUMOROUSLY DESCRIBED BY EDISON
THE BROKER WAS TAKEN WITH SUCH A FIT OF COUGHING HE BURST A BLOOD-VESSEL AND THE MAN WHO LET THE BROMINE OUT GOT AWAY AND NEVER CAME BACK
AT THE CLOSE OF THE EXPOSITION EDISON WAS CREATED A COMMANDER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR
THE CREEK WAS AT ONCE DRAGGED AND THEN THE BODY WAS RECOVERED
HE WOULD NOT LEAVE ON ANY ACCOUNT AND THEY AS YOUNG AMERICANS WOULD ALWAYS REGRET IT IF THEY FORSOOK THEIR NATIVE LAND WHOSE FREEDOM CLIMATE AND OPPORTUNITIES COULD NOT BE EQUALLED ANYWHERE ON THE FACE OF THE GLOBE
I TWISTED THE SHAFTING ONE WAY AND THE TUBE THE OTHER AS FAR AS I COULD AND PINNED THEM TOGETHER
ANY SUBSEQUENT EXPANSION OR CONTRACTION OF THE STRIP MAY READILY BE NOTED BY FURTHER MOVEMENTS OF THE NEEDLE
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS HAD A SHORTHAND MAN TRAVELLING WITH PRESIDENT JOHNSON WHEN HE MADE HIS CELEBRATED SWING AROUND THE CIRCLE IN A PRIVATE TRAIN DELIVERING HOT SPEECHES IN DEFENCE OF HIS CONDUCT
FOR INSTANCE AT THE TIME WHEN HE WAS MAKING STRENUOUS ENDEAVORS TO OBTAIN COPPER WIRE OF HIGH CONDUCTIVITY STRICT LABORATORY TESTS WERE MADE OF SAMPLES SENT BY MANUFACTURERS
I WAS GIVEN $5000 AS PART PAYMENT FOR THE INVENTION WHICH MADE ME EASY AND I EXPECTED THE WHOLE THING WOULD BE CLOSED UP
HERE FOR EXAMPLE IS A PICTURE DRAWN BY EDISON OF A LABORATORY INTERLUDE--JUST A BIT RABELAISIAN
HE WAS DESIROUS OF REALIZING UPON HIS INVENTIONS
BUT EVEN THIS BAMBOO LAMP WAS ONLY ONE ITEM OF A COMPLETE SYSTEM TO BE DEVISED--A SYSTEM THAT HAS SINCE COMPLETELY REVOLUTIONIZED THE ART OF INTERIOR ILLUMINATION

EDISON'S CONCLUSIONS ON THESE SUBSTANCES WERE THAT WHILE IN SOME RESPECTS THEY WERE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF POSSIBILITY FOR THE SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT THEY DID NOT REACH THE IDEAL THAT HE HAD IN MIND FOR COMMERCIAL RESULTS
CHIEF ENGINEER OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY 1881-84
THE BUILDING WAS WIRED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND EQUIPPED WITH ALL THE APPLIANCES OF THE ART
THE TOWN IN ITS PRISTINE PRIME WAS A GREAT LUMBER CENTRE AND HUMMED WITH THE INDUSTRY OF NUMEROUS SAWMILLS
AND THUS ENABLED THE AREA OF THE CROSS-SECTION OF THAT CONDUCTOR TO BE REDUCED EIGHTFOLD AND THUS TO BE MADE WITH ONE-EIGHTH OF THE AMOUNT OF COPPER OR OTHER METAL WHICH WOULD BE REQUIRED IF THE REDUCTION OF DIAMETER OF THE BURNER FROM ONE-THIRTY SECOND TO ONE-SIXTY-FOURTH OF AN INCH HAD NOT BEEN MADE
SO THAT THREE DAYS LATER THE SATISFACTORY EXPERIMENT WAS MADE OF THROWING ITS FLOOD OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY INTO A BANK OF ONE THOUSAND LAMPS ON AN UPPER FLOOR
THAT EIGHTFOLD INCREASE OF PROPORTION ENABLED THE RESISTANCE OF THE CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY FROM THE GENERATOR TO THE BURNER TO BE INCREASED EIGHTFOLD WITHOUT ANY INCREASE OF PERCENTAGE OF LOSS OF ENERGY IN THAT CONDUCTOR OR DECREASE OF PERCENTAGE OF DEVELOPMENT OF HEAT IN THE BURNER
THIS NATURALLY REQUIRED THE SERVICES OF A DRAFTSMAN ACCUSTOMED TO STEAM-LOCOMOTIVE PRACTICE
EDISON'S CHIEF CHEMIST SAYS
WHEN INTERROGATED AS TO HIS OBJECT HE STATED THAT THE PLAN WAS TO AFFORD BLIND PEOPLE THE MEANS OF WRITING DIRECTLY TO EACH OTHER ESPECIALLY IF THEY WERE ALSO DEAF AND COULD NOT HEAR A MESSAGE ON THE PHONOGRAPH

WHISTLING GOOD BUT NO ARTICULATION
BUT I THINK THE WHOLE TROUBLE LIES WITH THE SYSTEM IN VOGUE IN THE FEDERAL COURTS FOR TRYING PATENT SUITS AND IN THE FACT WHICH CANNOT BE DISPUTED THAT THE FEDERAL JUDGES WITH BUT FEW EXCEPTIONS DO NOT COMPREHEND COMPLICATED SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS
EDISON'S ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK COINCIDED WITH AN ACTIVE SPECULATION IN GOLD WHICH MAY INDEED BE SAID TO HAVE PROVIDED HIM WITH OCCUPATION
THAT REPOSITORY CAN CERTAINLY HAVE NO GREATER TREASURE OF ITS KIND
HE HAS OFTEN SAID THAT TIME MEANT VERY LITTLE TO HIM THAT HE HAD BUT A SMALL REALIZATION OF ITS PASSAGE AND THAT TEN OR TWENTY YEARS WERE AS NOTHING WHEN CONSIDERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VITAL INVENTION
NORMALLY THE FRICTIONAL PRESSURE BETWEEN THE DRUM AND PAD WOULD CARRY THE LATTER WITH THE FORMER AS IT REVOLVED BUT IF THE FRICTION WERE REMOVED A SPRING ON THE END OF THE VIBRATOR ARM WOULD DRAW IT BACK TO ITS STARTING-PLACE
HE REALIZED HOWEVER THAT THE ENORMOUS INVESTMENT FOR COPPER WOULD MILITATE AGAINST THE COMMERCIAL ADOPTION OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING ON AN EXTENDED SCALE
THESE ARE PLACED IN THE HANDS OF A PRODUCER CORRESPONDING TO A STAGE-DIRECTOR GENERALLY AN ACTOR OR THEATRICAL MAN OF EXPERIENCE WITH A HIGHLY DEVELOPED DRAMATIC INSTINCT
BEING BLESSED WITH A WISE AND DISCERNING MOTHER HIS ASPIRATIONS WERE ENCOURAGED
HE NEVER APPLIED FOR A PATENT ON THE INSTRUMENT BUT DEDICATED IT TO THE PUBLIC

WITHIN TWO YEARS THIS MAN COMPLETED AND MADE THAT ART AVAILABLE IN ITS ESSENTIAL FUNDAMENTAL FACTS WHICH REMAIN UNCHANGED AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF RAPID IMPROVEMENT AND WIDENING APPLICATION
EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL-STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIGHT TWO-WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND

THE FOUNDATIONS WERE BEING LAID FOR THE REMARKABLE CHEMICAL KNOWLEDGE THAT LATER ON GRAPPLED SUCCESSFULLY WITH SO MANY KNOTTY PROBLEMS IN THE REALM OF CHEMISTRY
AND THE DETERRENT INFLUENCE OF THE TELEPHONE ON THE TELEGRAPH HAD MADE ITSELF FELT BY 1890
WHEN I WAS PRESENTED TO MR EDISON HIS WAY OF SETTING FORTH THE MISSION HE HAD DESIGNATED FOR ME WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HOW A GREAT MIND CONCEIVES VAST UNDERTAKINGS AND COMMANDS GREAT THINGS IN FEW WORDS
LIKE OTHER SUCCESSFUL COMMANDERS EDISON ALSO POSSESSES THE HAPPY FACULTY OF CHOOSING SUITABLE LIEUTENANTS TO CARRY OUT HIS POLICIES AND TO MANAGE THE INDUSTRIES HE HAS CREATED SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS THOSE WITH WHICH THIS CHAPTER HAS TO DEAL--NAMELY THE PHONOGRAPH MOTION PICTURE PRIMARY BATTERY AND STORAGE BATTERY ENTERPRISES
MY INVENTION CONSISTS IN SUBSTITUTING RAPIDLY AND WITHOUT CONFUSION TO THE EYE NOT ONLY OF AN INDIVIDUAL BUT WHEN SO DESIRED OF A WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE THE ENLARGED IMAGES OF A GREAT NUMBER OF PICTURES WHEN TAKEN INSTANTANEOUSLY AND SUCCESSIVELY AT VERY SHORT INTERVALS
WE GOT IT ALL TAKEN APART AND PUT ON TRUCKS AND STARTED OFF
IT IMPLIES EITHER THAT THE MACHINE IS CAPABLE OF INCREASING ITS OWN ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE NINE TIMES WITHOUT AN INCREASED EXPENDITURE OF POWER OR THAT EXTERNAL RESISTANCE IS NOT RESISTANCE TO THE CURRENT INDUCED IN THE EDISON MACHINE
HENCE IT WAS DECIDED IN DECEMBER 1882 TO BEGIN CHARGING A PRICE FOR THE SERVICE AND ACCORDINGLY EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METERS WERE INSTALLED ON THE PREMISES OF EACH CUSTOMER THEN CONNECTED
IT WAS NOT THAT THERE REMAINED ANY BASIC PRINCIPLE TO BE DISCOVERED OR SIMPLIFIED FOR THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE

EDISON EXPRESSED HIS REGRETS BUT SAID HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE OLD CELLS AND WAS ENGAGED IN IMPROVING THEM

IT WAS DOUBTLESS FORTUNATE AND PROVIDENTIAL FOR THE ELECTRIC-LIGHTING ART THAT IN ITS STATE OF IMMATURE DEVELOPMENT IT DID NOT FALL INTO THE HANDS OF MEN WHO WERE OPPOSED TO ITS GROWTH AND WOULD NOT HAVE SOUGHT ITS TECHNICAL PERFECTION
THE ARC-LIGHTING METHODS WERE UNCONSCIOUSLY AND UNWITTINGLY PROPHETIC OF THE LATTER-DAY LONG-DISTANCE TRANSMISSIONS AT HIGH PRESSURE THAT ELECTRICALLY HAVE PLACED THE ENERGY OF NIAGARA AT THE COMMAND OF SYRACUSE AND UTICA AND HAVE PUT THE POWER OF THE FALLING WATERS OF THE SIERRAS AT THE DISPOSAL OF SAN FRANCISCO TWO HUNDRED MILES AWAY
MAN IS A SOCIAL ANIMAL AND THAT DESCRIBES EDISON
THIS STAND AS WELL AS THE FLOOR WAS ALMOST EATEN THROUGH BY THE DESTRUCTIVE ACTION OF THE POWERFUL ACID
IT WAS A BEWILDERING MOMENT THEREFORE TO THE MAPLEWOOD TEACHER WHEN IN ANSWERING A RAP AT THE DOOR ONE AFTERNOON HE FOUND INSTEAD OF AN IRATE MOTHER A MESSENGER FROM THE LABORATORY OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST INVENTOR BEARING A LETTER REQUESTING AN AUDIENCE A FEW HOURS LATER
ONE OF HIS ASSOCIATES WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH THE MANY YEARS OF THE STORAGE-BATTERY DRUDGERY WITH HIM SAID
IN ORIGINALLY COMMITTING HIMSELF TO THIS LINE OF INVESTIGATION HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT HE WAS GOING IN A DIRECTION DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE TO THAT FOLLOWED BY PREVIOUS INVESTIGATORS
AND HERE THE SECOND CONSIDERATION PRESENTS ITSELF
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE ORE-MILLING EXPERIMENTS WHEN PRACTICALLY HIS ENTIRE FORTUNE WAS SUNK IN AN ENTERPRISE THAT HAD TO BE CONSIDERED AN IMPOSSIBILITY WHEN AT THE AGE OF FIFTY HE LOOKED BACK UPON FIVE OR SIX YEARS OF INTENSE ACTIVITY EXPENDED APPARENTLY FOR NAUGHT WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMED MOST BLACK AND THE FINANCIAL CLOUDS WERE QUICKLY GATHERING ON THE HORIZON NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF REPINING ENTERED HIS MIND
OF THIS PERIOD AND HIS ASSOCIATION WITH JAY GOULD SOME VERY INTERESTING GLIMPSES ARE GIVEN BY EDISON
GREAT BALES OF SAMPLES WERE SENT TO EDISON AND AFTER CAREFUL TESTS A CERTAIN VARIETY AND GROWTH OF JAPANESE BAMBOO WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE MOST SATISFACTORY MATERIAL FOR FILAMENTS THAT HAD BEEN FOUND
BUT SOME REMINDERS OF ITS OLD-TIME GLORY STILL REMAIN IN EVIDENCE

HE PUTS A LIGHT DOWN IN THE BARREL AND LIGHTS IT UP AND IT AGES THE WHISKEY I MET CHINNOCK SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER AND SAID
AND IT MAY ALSO BE USED IN DETERMINING THE CHARACTER OR PRESSURE OF GASES AND VAPORS IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN PLACED
IF THIS WERE THE ONLY THING THAT HE HAD EVER ACCOMPLISHED IT WOULD ENTITLE HIM TO CONSIDERATION AS AN INVENTOR OF NOTE
THE REAL GREAT INVENTION LIES IN CREATING DEVICES THAT SHALL BE ABLE TO EVOKE FROM TINFOIL WAX OR COMPOSITION AT ANY TIME TO-DAY OR IN THE FUTURE THE SOUND THAT ONCE WAS AS EVANESCENT AS THE VIBRATIONS IT MADE ON THE AIR
ON A CERTAIN DAY WHEN THERE WAS A BOARD MEETING OF THE COMPANY I WAS TO MAKE AN EXHIBITION TEST
AND HERE AND THERE ARE HANDSOMELY MOUNTED SPECIMENS OF UNDERGROUND CONDUCTORS AND ELECTRIC WELDS THAT WERE MADE AT THE EDISON MACHINE WORKS AT SCHENECTADY BEFORE IT WAS MERGED INTO THE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY
I WAS WEARING A LINEN DUSTER AND WAS NOT MUCH TO LOOK AT BUT GOT A POSITION AT ONCE WORKING ON A PRESS WIRE
AND I STARTED FOR BOSTON
I THEN CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF TELEGRAPHING THE NEWS AHEAD WENT TO THE OPERATOR IN THE DEPOT AND BY GIVING HIM HARPER'S WEEKLY AND SOME OTHER PAPERS FOR THREE MONTHS HE AGREED TO TELEGRAPH TO ALL THE STATIONS THE MATTER ON THE BULLETIN-BOARD
ON CLOSING THE CIRCUIT OF A PRIMARY BATTERY AN ELECTRIC CURRENT IS GENERATED BY REASON OF THE CHEMICAL ACTION WHICH IS SET UP BETWEEN THE ELECTROLYTE AND THE ELEMENTS
SOME ELECTRICAL COMPANIES WANTED ALL THE AIR
UP TO THAT TIME HE HAD SEEN VERY LITTLE INCANDESCENT LIGHTING FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TO SEE
THE GREAT INVENTOR WHOSE IRON ENDURANCE AND STERN WILL HAVE ENABLED HIM TO WEAR DOWN ALL HIS ASSOCIATES BY WORK SUSTAINED THROUGH ARDUOUS DAYS AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS WAS NOT AT ALL STRONG AS A CHILD AND WAS OF FRAGILE APPEARANCE
IF ONE COULD DIVORCE EDISON FROM THE IDEA OF WORK AND COULD REGARD HIM SEPARATE AND APART FROM HIS EMBODIMENT AS AN INVENTOR AND MAN OF SCIENCE IT MIGHT TRULY BE ASSERTED THAT HIS TEMPERAMENT IS ESSENTIALLY MERCURIAL
OR TO EXPRESS IT OTHERWISE HE HAS FOUND REST IN TURNING FROM ONE FIELD OF WORK TO ANOTHER HAVING ABSOLUTELY NO RECREATIONS OR HOBBIES AND NOT NEEDING THEM
IF ERECTED IN THIS MANNER AND BY AN OPERATOR BUYING HIS MATERIALS IN LARGE QUANTITIES EDISON BELIEVES THAT THESE HOUSES CAN BE ERECTED COMPLETE INCLUDING HEATING APPARATUS AND PLUMBING FOR $1200 EACH
IT WILL AT ONCE BE PERCEIVED THAT THIS ACTION TAKES PLACE WHEN CURRENT FLOWS THROUGH THE ELECTROMAGNET AND ITS ARMATURE IS ATTRACTED DOWNWARD THE PLATEN AGAIN DROPPING AWAY FROM THE TYPE-WHEEL AS THE ARMATURE IS RELEASED UPON CESSATION OF CURRENT
AFTER YEARS OF WATCHING THE PROCESSES OF NATURE HE SAYS I CAN NO MORE DOUBT THE EXISTENCE OF AN INTELLIGENCE THAT IS RUNNING THINGS THAN I DO OF THE EXISTENCE OF MYSELF

THESE MEN WERE FROM THE SOUTH AND I HAVE ALWAYS RETAINED A SOFT SPOT IN MY HEART FOR A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN WHILE EDISON WAS A NEWSBOY ON THE TRAIN A REQUEST CAME TO HIM ONE DAY TO GO TO THE OFFICE OF E
JOHNSTON WHO AFTERWARD FOUNDED THE ELECTRICAL WORLD ON IT AS AN OFFSHOOT FROM THE OPERATOR
THE EARLIER EXPERIMENTS WITH WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY AT MENLO PARK WERE MADE AT A TIME WHEN EDISON WAS GREATLY OCCUPIED WITH HIS ELECTRIC-LIGHT INTERESTS AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF 1886 THAT HE WAS ABLE TO SPARE THE TIME TO MAKE A PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION OF THE SYSTEM AS APPLIED TO MOVING TRAINS
THIS IS TECHNICALLY TERMED THE NEUTRAL WIRE AND IN THE DISCHARGE OF ITS FUNCTIONS LIES THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMICAL DISTRIBUTION
TO A MAN OF EDISON'S PERCEPTION IT IS ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THAT THE EFFECT OF THE SO-CALLED DISCOVERY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE AS A MATTER OF DEDUCTION LONG BEFORE THE PHYSICAL SENSATION WAS EXPERIENCED
IN VARIOUS WAYS THERE WAS A CONTINUAL SLOW AND STEADY GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRY THUS CREATED NECESSITATING THE ERECTION OF MANY ADDITIONAL BUILDINGS AS THE YEARS PASSED BY
THIS SYSTEM WAS USED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS ON THE LEHIGH VALLEY RAILROAD ON THEIR CONSTRUCTION TRAINS
BUT VAN DUZER SWORE HE WOULD NEVER GIVE IN IN THIS CASE

A NOTEWORTHY INSTANCE OF EDISON'S MEMORY OCCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CEMENT PLANT
MY HEART WAS IN MY MOUTH AT FIRST BUT EVERYTHING WORKED ALL RIGHT
19 1874 207,723 DUPLEX TELEGRAPHS
SAFETY CONVENIENCE DURATION AND THE PRACTICAL IMPOSSIBILITY OF ALTERING A ONE-PIECE SOLID DWELLING ARE QUESTIONS THAT MUST BE MET BEFORE ITS CONSTRUCTION AND THEREFORE EDISON HAS PROCEEDED CALMLY ON HIS WAY TOWARD THE GOAL HE HAS EVER HAD CLEARLY IN MIND WITH UTTER INDIFFERENCE TO THE CRITICISMS AND JEERS OF THOSE WHO AS EXPERTS HAVE PROFESSED POSITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HIS CARRYING OUT THIS DARING SCHEME
AND IT WAS A COMMON AMBITION AMONG THE MORE INGENIOUS TO PRODUCE A NEW TICKER
THE DELIVERY OF THE MATERIAL--OR POURING AS IT IS CALLED--IS CONTINUED UNTIL EVERY PART OF THE SPACE IS FILLED AND THE MIXTURE IS EVEN WITH THE TIP OF THE ROOF THUS COMPLETING THE POURING OR CASTING OF THE HOUSE
ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE PIPE WERE OUTLETS TO WHICH THICK RUBBER TUBING WAS CONNECTED EACH TUBE TO A PUMP
GENERALLY SPEAKING NON-TECHNICAL AND UNINITIATED PERSONS HAVE A TENDENCY TO REGARD AN INVENTION AS BEING MORE OR LESS THE ULTIMATE RESULT OF SOME HAPPY INSPIRATION
FOR A FEW MOMENTS WE WAITED IN SUSPENSE AND THEN THE MAN HELD UP A SHEET OF PAPER CONTAINING A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE SHOOTING OF THE PRESIDENT
THE FRONT DOORS WERE CLOSED AND HE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM AS HE PLAYED
AND EDISON IN AN EASY-CHAIR WILL SIT THROUGH THE LONG EVENINGS TILL ONE OR TWO IN THE MORNING PULLING MEDITATIVELY AT HIS EYEBROWS QUOTING SOMETHING HE HAS JUST READ PERTINENT TO THE DISCUSSION HEARING AND TELLING NEW STORIES WITH GUSTO OFFERING ALL KINDS OF INGENIOUS SUGGESTIONS AND WITHOUT FAIL GETTING HOLD OF PADS AND SHEETS OF PAPER ON WHICH TO MAKE ILLUSTRATIVE SKETCHES
SO WELL INDEED THAT I BELIEVE NO PRACTICAL USE WAS EVER MADE OF THE BAMBOO FIBRES THEREAFTER
THE EXPERIMENTS ON ARMATURE-WINDING WERE ALSO VERY INTERESTING
465,971
IT WILL BE NOTICED THAT IN THIS ARRANGEMENT NO BATTERY IS USED THE STRENGTH OF THE IMPULSES TRANSMITTED IS THEREFORE LIMITED TO THAT OF THE NECESSARILY WEAK INDUCTION CURRENTS GENERATED BY THE ORIGINAL SOUNDS MINUS ANY LOSS ARISING BY REASON OF RESISTANCE IN THE LINE
YET OTHER VISITORS AGAIN HAUNTED THE PLACE AND WITH THE FOLLOWING REMINISCENCE OF ONE OF THEM FROM MR EDISON HIMSELF THIS PART OF THE CHAPTER MUST CLOSE
CHAPTER VIII AUTOMATIC DUPLEX AND QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPHY WORK OF VARIOUS KINDS POURED IN UPON THE YOUNG MANUFACTURER BUSY ALSO WITH HIS OWN SCHEMES AND INVENTIONS WHICH SOON BEGAN TO FOLLOW SO MANY DISTINCT LINES OF INQUIRY THAT IT CEASES TO BE EASY OR NECESSARY FOR THE HISTORIAN TO TREAT THEM ALL IN CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE
IN HIS EARLIER WORK HE DIRECTED HIS ATTENTION TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF A SINGLE-CIRCUIT SYSTEM IN WHICH ONLY ONE WIRE WAS REQUIRED THE TWO OPERATIONS OF SETTING THE TYPE-WHEELS AND OF PRINTING BEING CONTROLLED BY SEPARATE ELECTROMAGNETS WHICH WERE ACTUATED THROUGH POLARIZED RELAYS AS OCCASION REQUIRED ONE POLARITY ENERGIZING THE ELECTROMAGNET CONTROLLING THE TYPE-WHEELS AND THE OPPOSITE POLARITY ENERGIZING THE ELECTROMAGNET CONTROLLING THE PRINTING
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE DIAPHRAGM OF A TELEPHONE VIBRATES WITH THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE CURRENT ENERGIZING THE MAGNET BENEATH IT
HENCE THE ELIMINATION OF THE WORTHLESS GANGUE BY CONCENTRATION OF THE IRON PARTICLES ASSOCIATED WITH IT SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM
IN THOSE DAYS PUBLIC OPINION WAS NOT SO ALIVE AS NOW TO THE DESIRABILITY OF PRESERVING SHADE-TREES AND OF ENHANCING THE BEAUTY OF A CITY INSTEAD OF DESTROYING IT
IT WILL BE EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE OPERATOR AT A MAY CAUSE THE RELAY AT B TO ACT WITHOUT AFFECTING HIS OWN RELAY
BETWEEN OCTOBER 21 1879 AND DECEMBER 21 1879 SOME HUNDREDS OF THESE PAPER-CARBON LAMPS HAD BEEN MADE AND PUT INTO ACTUAL USE NOT ONLY IN THE LABORATORY BUT IN THE STREETS AND SEVERAL RESIDENCES AT MENLO PARK NEW JERSEY CAUSING GREAT EXCITEMENT AND BRINGING MANY VISITORS FROM FAR AND NEAR
THEY SAID THEY WERE NOT IN ERROR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FEET AND THAT THE STATION WAS TWELVE MILES OUT OF THE POSITION GIVEN ON THE MAPS
EACH TIME CRUMPLING THE PAPER UP IN HIS HAND AND THROWING IT ON THE FLOOR
THEN EVERYTHING WORKED ALL RIGHT
YOUNG MAN IF THERE IS ANY INVENTION ON EARTH THAT WE DON'T WANT DOWN HERE IT IS THIS
HERE AND THERE IN THESE CABINETS MAY ALSO BE FOUND A FEW MODELS WHICH HE HAS USED AT TIMES IN HIS STUDIES OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY
SUCH WAS THE TREND OF PUBLIC OPINION AT THE TIME BUT AFTER MR KRUESI HAD FINISHED THE FIRST PRACTICAL DYNAMO AND AFTER MR UPTON HAD TESTED IT THOROUGHLY AND VERIFIED HIS FIGURES AND RESULTS SEVERAL TIMES--FOR HE ALSO WAS SURPRISED--EDISON WAS ABLE TO TELL THE WORLD THAT HE HAD MADE A GENERATOR GIVING AN EFFICIENCY OF 90 PER CENT NINETY PER CENT
WHEN THEREFORE IT IS SAID THAT WE SHOULD ONLY BELIEVE THINGS WE ACTUALLY SEE WE OUGHT TO REMEMBER THAT IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE WE NEVER SEE THINGS AS THEY ARE
THESE VOLUMES AIM TO BE A BIOGRAPHY RATHER THAN A HISTORY OF ELECTRICITY BUT THEY HAVE HAD TO COVER SO MUCH GENERAL GROUND IN DEFINING THE RELATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF EDISON TO THE ELECTRICAL ARTS THAT THEY SERVE TO PRESENT A PICTURE OF THE WHOLE DEVELOPMENT EFFECTED IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THE MOST FRUITFUL THAT ELECTRICITY HAS KNOWN

SIX MONTHS AFTERWARD WHILE WORKING PRESS WIRE IN CINCINNATI ABOUT 2 A.M THERE WAS FLUNG INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE OPERATING-ROOM A LARGE TIN BOX
BY AN EXTRAORDINARY COINCIDENCE THE VERY DAY THAT BELL'S APPLICATION FOR A PATENT WENT INTO THE UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE A CAVEAT WAS FILED THERE BY ELISHA GRAY OF CHICAGO COVERING THE SPECIFIC IDEA OF TRANSMITTING SPEECH AND REPRODUCING IT IN A TELEGRAPHIC CIRCUIT THROUGH AN INSTRUMENT CAPABLE OF VIBRATING RESPONSIVELY TO ALL THE TONES OF THE HUMAN VOICE AND BY WHICH THEY ARE RENDERED AUDIBLE OUT OF THIS INCIDENT AROSE A STRUGGLE AND A CONTROVERSY WHOSE ECHOES ARE YET HEARD AS TO THE LEGAL AND MORAL RIGHTS OF THE TWO INVENTORS THE ASSERTION EVEN BEING MADE THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CLAIMS OF GRAY THAT ON A LIQUID BATTERY TRANSMITTER WAS SURREPTITIOUSLY LIFTED INTO THE BELL APPLICATION THEN COVERING ONLY THE MAGNETO TELEPHONE
NEITHER HIS IGNORANCE NOR HIS SIMPLICITY PREVENTED HIM FROM TAKING OUT THREE PATENTS

AT THIS TIME HE WAS INVESTIGATING EVERYTHING WITH A MICROSCOPE AND ONE DAY IN THE EARLY PART OF 1880 HE NOTICED UPON A TABLE IN THE LABORATORY AN ORDINARY PALM-LEAF FAN
A STAND WAS BUILT RAISED ABOVE THE GENERAL LEVEL WHERE THE PRINCE WAS TO BE RECEIVED BY THE MAYOR
APRIL 23 1873 162,633 DUPLEX TELEGRAPHS
IN ENGLAND THE CASE IS DIFFERENT
IF THEREFORE THERE BE PLACED IN THE SAME CIRCUIT A REGULAR TELEGRAPH RELAY AND A SPECIAL TELEPHONE AN OPERATOR MAY BY MANIPULATING A KEY OPERATE THE RELAY AND ITS SOUNDER WITHOUT PRODUCING A SOUND IN THE TELEPHONE AS THE MAKES AND BREAKS OF THE KEY ARE FAR BELOW THE LIMIT OF AUDIBILITY
THE HYPERCRITICAL MAY CAVIL AND SAY THAT AS A MANUFACTURER OF CEMENT EDISON WILL BE BENEFITED
CALLAHAN AN INGENIOUS PRINTING-TELEGRAPH OPERATOR SAW THAT THERE WERE UNEXHAUSTED POSSIBILITIES IN THE IDEA AND HIS FORESIGHT AND INVENTIVENESS MADE HIM THE FATHER OF THE TICKER IN CONNECTION WITH WHICH HE WAS THUS LIKE LAWS ONE OF THE FIRST TO GRASP AND EXPLOIT THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE OF THE CENTRAL STATION AS A UNIVERSAL SOURCE OF SUPPLY
HE WILL SEE THE GENERAL NATURE OF A RESULT LONG BEFORE IT CAN BE REACHED BY MATHEMATICAL CALCULATION
IN CASES WHERE IT IS DESIRABLE TO REPRODUCE THE SIGNALS IN THE LOCAL CIRCUIT WITH THE SAME VARIATIONS IN STRENGTH AS THEY ARE RECEIVED BY THE RELAY THE EDISON CARBON PRESSURE RELAY DOES THE WORK
BUT EDISON COULD NOT BE MOVED FROM HIS DETERMINATION ALTHOUGH CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE WAS AT TIMES BROUGHT TO BEAR TO SWAY HIS DECISION
BORST DID LESS TALKING THAN ANY OPERATOR I EVER KNEW
TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR HE DID NOT SAY MUCH BUT LOOKED IT
ANOTHER INCIDENT OF THE PERIOD IS AS FOLLOWS
DURATION ON ACCOUNT OF ITS DEPENDABILITY
WHEN THE GREAT NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED IN 1885 ITS ORGANIZERS WERE THE CAPTAINS OF ARC LIGHTING AND NOT A SINGLE EDISON COMPANY OR LICENSEE COULD BE FOUND IN ITS RANKS OR DARED TO SOLICIT MEMBERSHIP
UNDETERRED BY THE UNANIMITY OF ADVERSE OPINIONS HOWEVER HE PURSUED HIS INVESTIGATIONS WITH THE THOROUGH MINUTENESS THAT CHARACTERIZES ALL HIS LABORATORY WORK AND IN DUE TIME PRODUCED A MIXTURE WHICH ON ELABORATE TEST OVERCAME ALL OBJECTIONS AND ANSWERED THE COMPLEX REQUIREMENTS PERFECTLY INCLUDING THE MAKING OF A SURFACE SMOOTH EVEN AND ENTIRELY WATERPROOF
I DO IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND I ASK YOU TO READ THE TESTIMONY OF CHARLES L
HE CAME AND WAS PUT IN MY CARE FOR THE PURPOSE OF A MUTUAL EXCHANGE OF IDEAS AND FOR A REPORT BY ME AS TO HIS COMPETENCY IN THE MATTER
THE SMELL WAS TERRIFIC AND THE EFFECT ADDED TO THE HILARITY OF THE EXCURSION
HOW DID THAT CIGAR BUSINESS WORK I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT

JUST THAT ONE PARTICULAR PATH FOR THE CURRENT IS INTERRUPTED BUT NONE OF THE OTHER LAMPS IS INTERFERED WITH
BUT IF THE MAKE AND BREAK BE AS SLOW AS WITH ORDINARY MORSE TRANSMISSION THE DIAPHRAGM WILL BE MERELY FLEXED AND RETURN TO ITS ORIGINAL FORM WITHOUT PRODUCING A SOUND
THE HOUSES AFTERWARD WENT ONTO THE NEW YORK EDISON SYSTEM THE ART WAS HOWEVER VERY CRUDE AND RAW AND AS THERE WERE NO ARTISANS IN EXISTENCE AS MECHANICS OR ELECTRICIANS WHO HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRACTICE THERE WAS INCONCEIVABLE DIFFICULTY IN GETTING SUCH ISOLATED PLANTS INSTALLED AS WELL AS WIRING THE BUILDINGS IN THE DISTRICT TO BE COVERED BY THE FIRST CENTRAL STATION IN NEW YORK
AND HE GOT BACK CONTROL OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC
EDISON'S ORE-MILLING INVENTIONS THE WIDE RANGE OF EDISON'S ACTIVITIES IN THIS DEPARTMENT OF THE ARTS IS WELL REPRESENTED IN THE DIVERSITY OF THE NUMEROUS PATENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO HIM FROM TIME TO TIME
I WAS INFORMED THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT GO IN THE GALLERY IN WARM WEATHER OWING TO THE GREAT HEAT CAUSED BY THE MANY GAS JETS WHEREAS ON THE INTRODUCTION OF THE INCANDESCENT LAMP THERE WAS NO COMPLAINT THE TELEGRAPH OPERATING-ROOM OF THE GENERAL POST-OFFICE AT ST MARTIN'S-LE GRAND AND NEWGATE STREET NEARBY WAS SUPPLIED WITH FOUR HUNDRED LAMPS THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF MR SIR W
EDISON FOUND THAT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE WAS KNOWN BY MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ABOUT NICKEL AND IRON OXIDES OF THE HIGH GRADE AND PURITY HE REQUIRED
THIS PATENT EMBODIES BUT TWO CLAIMS WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS
IN CONNECTION WITH THESE BATTERIES MR HAMMER TELLS A CHARACTERISTIC ANECDOTE OF EDISON
VAN DER WEYDE A WELL-KNOWN PHYSICIST IN HIS DAY AND WAS EXHIBITED BY HIM BEFORE A TECHNICAL AUDIENCE AT COOPER UNION NEW YORK IN 1868 AND DESCRIBED SHORTLY AFTER IN THE TECHNICAL PRESS
THE ROYALTIES FROM BOSTON EVER INTELLECTUALLY AWAKE AND READY FOR SOMETHING NEW RAN AS HIGH AS $1800 A WEEK
CONSEQUENTLY BEYOND THAT POINT THERE WAS A ZONE OF ONLY ABOUT FORTY FEET THROUGH WHICH THE HEATED GASES PASSED AND CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE ONCOMING MATERIAL WHICH WAS IN MOVEMENT DOWN TOWARD THE CLINKERING ZONE
AND THIRD TO ACCOMPLISH THESE RESULTS AT A COST SUFFICIENTLY LOW TO GIVE THE PRODUCT A COMMERCIAL VALUE
IT WAS HIS WINNING WAYS AND MANNERS THAT ATTACHED US ALL SO LOYALLY TO HIS SIDE AND MADE US EVER READY WITH A BOUNDLESS DEVOTION TO EXECUTE ANY REQUEST OR DESIRE THUS DOES A GREAT MAGNET RUN THROUGH A HEAP OF SAND AND FILINGS EXERT ITS LINES OF FORCE AND ATTRACT IRRESISTIBLY TO ITSELF THE IRON AND STEEL PARTICLES THAT ARE ITS AFFINITY AND HAVING SIFTED THEM OUT LEAVING THE USELESS DUST BEHIND HOLD THEM TO ITSELF WITH RESPONSIVE TENACITY
BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL-WILL
BUT THIS DEMAND WAS SO INSISTENT IT COULD NOT BE DENIED AND IT WAS DEEMED DESIRABLE TO COMPLY WITH IT AT ONCE ESPECIALLY AS IT WAS SEEN THAT THE STEADY CALL FOR SUPPLIES AND RENEWALS WOULD BENEFIT THE NEW EDISON MANUFACTURING PLANTS

BUT IT GRADUALLY MADE ITS WAY
WE BOUGHT THEM VERY REASONABLY AND MOVED EVERYTHING THERE
AND WHENEVER HE COULD GET THE CHANCE EDISON RODE IN THE CAB WITH THE ENGINEER OF HIS TRAIN
SUCH STENCILS CAN BE PREPARED ON TYPEWRITERS
SURROUNDING THE WHOLE WAS ERECTED A HIGH PICKET FENCE WITH A GATE PLACED ON VALLEY ROAD
BUT IN MOST CASES THE INVENTOR HAS INTENTIONALLY SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH A DEFINITE AND DESIRED RESULT--MOSTLY THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THE KNOWN LAWS OF THE ART IN WHICH HE HAPPENS TO BE WORKING
REPRODUCTIONS WERE OBTAINED IN THE SAME WAY POSITIVE PRINTS BEING OBSERVED THROUGH A MAGNIFYING GLASS
CHAPTER X THE PHONOGRAPH AT THE OPENING OF THE ELECTRICAL SHOW IN NEW YORK CITY IN OCTOBER 1908 TO CELEBRATE THE JUBILEE OF THE ATLANTIC CABLE AND THE FIRST QUARTER CENTURY OF LIGHTING WITH THE EDISON SERVICE ON MANHATTAN ISLAND THE EXERCISES WERE ALL CONDUCTED BY MEANS OF THE EDISON PHONOGRAPH

IN REALITY IT WAS NOT THE WAY ALTHOUGH A MONUMENT ERECTED TO HIS MEMORY AT FRANKFORT STYLES HIM THE INVENTOR OF THE TELEPHONE

ONE COULD COUNT SO-CALLED ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON HIS FINGERS THEN AND HAVE SOME FINGERS LEFT OVER
WHEN THIS PICKEREL SAW THE RED ROACH THROUGH THE GLASS HE MADE ONE OF THOSE AWFUL DASHES WHICH IS USUALLY THE RUIN OF WHATEVER STANDS IN ITS WAY

SUCH CONDUCTORS MIGHT EITHER BE SEPARATE AS SHOWN ABOVE FIG
A SINGLE APPARATUS AT EACH END IS THEREFORE SUFFICIENT PERFORMING THE DOUBLE FUNCTION OF TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER
THE TASTE OF THE COFFEE THE INSECTS ETC WERE TOO MUCH
AMONG THESE WAS MR LOUIS RAU OF PARIS WHO ORGANIZED THE FRENCH EDISON COMPANY THE PIONEER EDISON LIGHTING CORPORATION IN EUROPE AND WHO WITH THE AID OF MR BATCHELOR ESTABLISHED LAMP-WORKS AND A MACHINE-SHOP AT IVRY SUR-SEINE NEAR PARIS IN 1882
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE JOKES IS TO ENTER THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT WITH AN AIR OF GREAT HUMILITY AND APPLY FOR A JOB AS AN INVENTOR
EACH DIAPHRAGM HAD ATTACHED TO IT A NEEDLE
EACH SIDE IF CONSIDERED SEPARATELY HAS A POTENTIAL OF ABOUT 110 VOLTS YET THE POTENTIAL OF THE TWO OUTSIDE CONDUCTORS P AND N IS 220 VOLTS
ONE AFTERNOON AFTER OUR PEARL STREET STATION STARTED A POLICEMAN RUSHED IN AND TOLD US TO SEND AN ELECTRICIAN AT ONCE UP TO THE CORNER OF ANN AND NASSAU STREETS--SOME TROUBLE
I WAS EXPERIMENTING HE SAYS ON AN AUTOMATIC METHOD OF RECORDING TELEGRAPH MESSAGES ON A DISK OF PAPER LAID ON A REVOLVING PLATEN EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE DISK TALKING-MACHINE OF TO-DAY

HAVING HAD A CURSORY GLANCE AT THE TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLANT UP TO THE POINT OF ITS SUCCESSFUL CULMINATION IN THE MAKING OF A MARKETABLE COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE TEST AT THE CRANE FURNACE LET US REVERT TO THAT DEMONSTRATION AND NOTE THE EVENTS THAT FOLLOWED
THIS ENTERPRISE WILL BE CONDUCTED BY A CORPORATION WHICH HAS BEEN SPECIALLY ORGANIZED FOR THE PURPOSE
ITS AIM BEING OF COURSE TO GENERATE ELECTRICAL ENERGY DIRECTLY FROM THE HEAT OF THE COMBUSTIBLE
BERGMANN WAS INDUCED TO ENTER THE GAME
I FILED A GREAT MANY APPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS AT THAT TIME BUT THERE WERE SEVENTY-EIGHT OF THE INVENTIONS I MADE IN THAT PERIOD THAT WERE ENTIRELY LOST TO ME AND MY COMPANY BY REASON OF THE DISHONESTY OF THIS PATENT SOLICITOR
THIS WAS AN EQUIVALENT OF THE METHOD ILLUSTRATED IN FIG
THEN THERE WERE MESSRS

AS I TOOK ON AN AVERAGE FROM EIGHT TO FIFTEEN COLUMNS OF NEWS REPORT EVERY DAY IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO PERFECT THIS METHOD MR EDISON HAS ADHERED TO THIS CHARACTERISTIC STYLE OF PENMANSHIP DOWN TO THE PRESENT TIME
WITH THE BELL APPARATUS THE VERY WEAK ELECTRIC IMPULSES GENERATED BY THE VIBRATION OF THE TRANSMITTING DIAPHRAGM PASS OVER THE ENTIRE LINE TO THE RECEIVING END AND IN CONSEQUENCE THE POSSIBLE LENGTH OF LINE IS LIMITED TO A FEW MILES EVEN UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS
FOUR ELECTRICAL PULSATIONS WERE REQUIRED TO MOVE THE DRUM THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE FRACTIONS
BEACH THEN OF THE STREET-RAILWAY DEPARTMENT OF THE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY HE SAID
IN THE FOREGOING PAGES OF THIS CHAPTER THE AUTHORS HAVE ENDEAVORED TO PRESENT VERY BRIEFLY A SKETCHY NOTION OF THE ASTOUNDING RANGE OF EDISON'S PRACTICAL IDEAS BUT THEY FEEL A SENSE OF IMPOTENCE IN BEING UNABLE TO DEAL ADEQUATELY WITH THE SUBJECT IN THE SPACE THAT CAN BE DEVOTED TO IT
THERE WAS SOME KIND OF CONSPIRACY WITH THE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE WHICH I COULD NOT MAKE OUT BUT I HEARD MESSAGES THAT OPENED MY EYES AS TO THE RAMIFICATIONS OF WALL STREET
EDISON'S ACCOUNTS OF THE SPREES AND DEBAUCHES OF OTHER NIGHT OPERATORS IN THE LOOSELY MANAGED OFFICES ENABLE ONE TO UNDERSTAND HOW EVEN A LITTLE STEADY APPLICATION TO THE WORK IN HAND WOULD BE APPRECIATED

THIS WONDERFUL APTITUDE FOR INFALLIBLY LOCATING AN ERROR WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S HESITATION FOR MENTAL CALCULATION HAS ALWAYS APPEALED TO ME VERY FORCIBLY THE ABILITY TO DETECT ERRORS QUICKLY IN A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS ENABLED EDISON TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH A VAST AMOUNT OF WORK AS THE RECORDS SHOW
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS HAD BEEN SPENT ON THE EXPERIMENTS AND LARGELY WITHOUT EDISON'S CONSENT THE BATTERY HAD BEEN VERY GENERALLY EXPLOITED IN THE PRESS
THE LABORATORY NOTE-BOOKS OF THIS PERIOD--1878-80 MORE PARTICULARLY--SHOW AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF CALCULATION BY EDISON AND HIS CHIEF MATHEMATICIAN MR UPTON ON CONDUCTORS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF CURRENT OVER LARGE AREAS AND THEN LATER IN THE DISTRICT DESCRIBED
FROM THE RANGE OF THE WESTERN GHAUTS I WENT TO BOMBAY AND THEN NORTH BY THE WAY OF DELHI TO SIMLA THE SUMMER CAPITAL OF THE HIMALAYAS
JOHNSON AND I WENT TO THE CHARLESTON END TO CARRY OUT EDISON'S PLANS WHICH WERE RAPIDLY UNFOLDED BY TELEGRAPH EVERY NIGHT FROM A LOFT ON LOWER BROADWAY NEW YORK
TO EXPLOIT THE DEVICE COMMERCIALLY THE PATENTS WERE SOLD TO PHILADELPHIA CAPITALISTS WHO ORGANIZED THE NORTH AMERICAN PHONOGRAPH COMPANY THROUGH WHICH LEASES FOR LIMITED PERIODS WERE GRANTED TO LOCAL COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN SPECIAL TERRITORIES GENERALLY WITHIN THE CONFINES OF A SINGLE STATE
UPON INQUIRING HE FOUND THAT THEY TOOK HIM FOR A PRIEST WITH HIS DARK GARB SMOOTH-SHAVEN FACE AND SERIOUS EXPRESSION
ABOUT FOUR HOURS BEFORE THE STEAMER HAD TO GET IT THE MACHINE WAS SHUT DOWN AFTER THE TEST AND A SCHEDULE WAS MADE OUT IN ADVANCE OF WHAT EACH MAN HAD TO DO
IN SUCH A CASE THE MOVEMENTS WOULD BE THE REVERSE OF THOSE ABOVE INDICATED BUT THE END SOUGHT--NAMELY THE RELAYING OF MESSAGES--WOULD BE ATTAINED WITH THE SAME CERTAINTY
BELL WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE FIRST INVENTOR OF THE ART OF TRANSMITTING SPEECH OVER AN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT BUT WITH HIS PARTICULAR FORM OF TELEPHONE THE FIELD WAS CIRCUMSCRIBED
THE NEXT MORNING TUESDAY EDISON TOOK HIS NEW FIDUS ACHATES WITH HIM TO A CONFERENCE WITH JOHN ROACH THE FAMOUS OLD SHIP-BUILDER AND AT IT AGREED TO TAKE THE AETNA IRON WORKS WHERE ROACH HAD LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF HIS FAME AND FORTUNE
BUT OTHER TIMES HE WOULD GO REGULARLY TO HIS OFFICE IN THE MORNING
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW LABORATORY IN WEST ORANGE JUST AT THE FOOT OF LLEWELLYN PARK ON THE ORANGE MOUNTAINS NOT ONLY MARKED THE HAPPY BEGINNING OF A PERIOD OF PERFECT DOMESTIC AND FAMILY LIFE BUT SAW IN THE PLANNING AND EQUIPMENT OF A MODEL LABORATORY PLANT THE CONSUMMATION OF YOUTHFUL DREAMS AND OF THE KEEN DESIRE TO ENJOY RESOURCES ADEQUATE AT ANY MOMENT TO WHATEVER STRAIN THE FIERCE FERVOR OF RESEARCH MIGHT PUT UPON THEM
THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE THREE LAST PRECEDING SENTENCES WILL NOT BE OBVIOUS TO LAYMEN AS UNDOUBTEDLY MANY OF THE READERS OF THIS BOOK MAY BE
AND THROWING THE MONEY ON THE COUNTER THE STORE BEING FILLED WITH WOMEN CLERKS HE SAID
TO THIS QUESTION A STRICT REGARD FOR TRUTH COMPELS THE ANSWER THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN BENEFITED AT ALL NOT TO THE EXTENT OF A SINGLE DOLLAR SO FAR AS CASH DAMAGES ARE CONCERNED
THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY-SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
HE FOUND A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY IN THE SLUICE-BOXES OF THE CHEROKEE VALLEY MINING COMPANY
THE WESTERN UNION OPERATOR CAME TO ME AND SAID
HE THEN BARED HIS LEGS AND ARMS AND THEY WERE LITERALLY PITTED WITH SCARS DUE TO THE USE OF HYPODERMIC SYRINGES
OUR MAGNETIC NEEDLE INDICATED THE PRESENCE AND RICHNESS OF THE INVISIBLE DEPOSITS OF MAGNETIC ORE
JENKS THE MANAGER OF THE EDISON CENTRAL STATION AT BROCKTON MASSACHUSETTS
BUT DELIVERS LOW-TENSION DIRECT CURRENT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE REGULAR EDISON THREE-WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT MILAN
HE HAD REPORTS SENT TO HIM DAILY FROM VARIOUS PLACES AND STUDIED THEM CAREFULLY FOR HE WOULD WRITE FREQUENTLY WITH COMMENTS INSTRUCTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
THEY SERVED HOWEVER TO CONVINCE EDISON THAT IF HE EVER EXPECTED TO CARRY OUT HIS SCHEME ON THE EXTENSIVE SCALE PLANNED HE COULD NOT DEPEND UPON THE MARKET TO SUPPLY SUITABLE MACHINERY FOR IMPORTANT OPERATIONS BUT WOULD BE OBLIGED TO DEVISE AND BUILD IT HIMSELF
NOW AFTER DISTILLING THE TURPENTINE OFF ACT ON THE RESIDUE WITH ALL THE SOLVENTS THAT WERE USED ON THE RESIDUE USING FOR THE FIRST THE SOLVENT WHICH IS LEAST LIKELY TO DISSOLVE A GREAT PART OF IT
THE ROCKS HAVING THUS BEEN REDUCED TO FINE POWDER THE MASS WAS READY FOR SCREENING ON ITS WAY TO THE MAGNETIC SEPARATORS
AND STILL OTHERS OF SHEETS OF IRON OF VARIOUS THICKNESSES SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BY PAPER OR PAINT
HIS ATTENTION HAS SHIFTED CHRONOLOGICALLY AND BY PROCESS OF EVOLUTION FROM ONE PROBLEM TO ANOTHER AND SOME RESULTS ARE FOUND TO BE FINAL

HENCE THE BAR WOULD REMAIN NON-MAGNETIC
THE ORDINARY SPEED OF TELEGRAPHIC SIGNALS IS THIRTY-FIVE TO FORTY WORDS A MINUTE
EDISON WOULD NOT CONSIDER A POSTPONEMENT OF THE EXHIBITION SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT GO TO WORK AND WIND IT BY HAND
CERTAINLY YOU CAN HAVE THE MONEY I MADE MY DEPOSIT AND THEY PULLED ME THROUGH ALL RIGHT
OF THE QUANTITY OF CLINKER PRODUCED
GENERALLY SPEAKING CUSTOMERS FOUND THAT THEIR BILLS COMPARED FAIRLY WITH GAS BILLS FOR CORRESPONDING MONTHS WHERE THE SAME AMOUNT OF LIGHT WAS USED AND THEY PAID PROMPTLY AND CHEERFULLY WITH EMPHATIC ENCOMIUMS OF THE NEW LIGHT
AT MENLO PARK NEW JERSEY I HAD MY LABORATORY
FROM THE LATE SUMMER OF 1878 AND TO THE FALL OF 1887 EDISON WAS INTENSELY BUSY ON THE ELECTRIC LIGHT ELECTRIC RAILWAY AND OTHER PROBLEMS AND VIRTUALLY GAVE NO ATTENTION TO THE PHONOGRAPH
THERE IS PERHAPS SOME EXCUSE FOR SUCH INDIFFERENCE
REFERENCE TO THIS BY EDISON HIMSELF HAS ALREADY BEEN QUOTED
MR SPRAGUE SERVED ON THE JURY AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE EXHIBITION WITH DARWIN'S SON--THE PRESENT SIR HORACE--AND AFTER THE TESTS WERE ENDED LEFT THE NAVY AND ENTERED EDISON'S SERVICE AT THE SUGGESTION OF MR E
THUS ANY JOKE OR STORY ORIGINATING ANYWHERE IN THAT AREA WAS KNOWN THE NEXT DAY ALL OVER
THE GENERAL SCHEME BRIEFLY OUTLINED IS TO PREPARE A MODEL AND PLANS OF THE HOUSE TO BE CAST AND THEN TO DESIGN A SET OF MOLDS IN SECTIONS OF CONVENIENT SIZE
I AM LIVING FOR TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW
HE DID NOT HOWEVER FOLLOW UP THIS INVENTION AND PUT IT INTO PRACTICE
THOSE WHO WERE LABORING WITH HIM INSPIRED BY HIS UNFLAGGING ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE AND DEVOTED ALL THEIR LONG WAKING HOURS TO THE FURTHERANCE OF HIS PLANS WITH A ZEAL THAT ULTIMATELY BORE FRUIT IN THE PRACTICAL SUCCESS HERE RECORDED
I BUILT A VERY LARGE DYNAMO WITH THE ENGINE DIRECTLY CONNECTED WHICH I INTENDED FOR THE PARIS EXPOSITION OF 1881
NOR IS THE SPIRIT OF THE LABORATORY WORK REPRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE OVERHEARD BETWEEN TWO ALLEGED CARPENTERS PICKED UP AT RANDOM TO HELP ON A HURRY JOB
BUT THE WIRE ATTACHED TO ONE OF THE PLATES WAS TOO LONG TO GO IN THE METER AND HE HAD CUT IT OFF
THEY COULD HAVE BEEN EMBODIED BY INTERLINEATIONS AND MARGINAL NOTES IN THE ORDINARY WAY AND CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE REQUIRED MORE THAN TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES OF HIS TIME
WHEN I REPLIED THAT I HAD BUT THAT HE MUST BE THE FINAL JUDGE OF WHAT I HAD FOUND HE SAID THAT DURING MY ABSENCE HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING AN ARTIFICIAL CARBON WHICH WAS MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS SATISFACTORILY
ALSO ILLUSTRATED ARTICLES IN THE TECHNICAL JOURNALS OF THE TIME AMONG WHICH MAY BE MENTIONED
THE OUTSTANDING CAPITALIZED VALUE OF THE PLANT WAS $814,616,004 THE INCOME FOR THE YEAR WAS NEARLY $185,000,000 AND THE PEOPLE EMPLOYED WERE 140,000
NO SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS WERE TAKEN TO INSULATE THE RAILS FROM THE EARTH OR FROM EACH OTHER THE ROAD STARTED ABOUT FIFTY FEET AWAY FROM THE GENERATING STATION WHICH IN THIS CASE WAS THE MACHINE SHOP
IN EXPERIMENTING SOME YEARS PREVIOUSLY I HAD DISCOVERED A VERY PECULIAR PHENOMENON AND THAT WAS THAT IF A PIECE OF METAL CONNECTED TO A BATTERY WAS RUBBED OVER A MOISTENED PIECE OF CHALK RESTING ON A METAL CONNECTED TO THE OTHER POLE WHEN THE CURRENT PASSED THE FRICTION WAS GREATLY DIMINISHED
THE NARRATIVE HOWEVER WOULD NOT BE COMPLETE WITHOUT SOME MENTION OF THE GENERAL OUTLINE OF HIS WORK AND REFERENCE MAY BE MADE BRIEFLY TO A FEW OF THE CHIEF ITEMS
A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT OPERATING ONE OF HELMHOLTZ'S ARTIFICIAL LARYNXES
THE OLD CAVEAT SYSTEM HAS NOW BEEN ABOLISHED BUT IT SERVED TO ELICIT FROM EDISON A MOST ASTOUNDING RECORD OF IDEAS AND POSSIBLE INVENTIONS UPON WHICH HE WAS WORKING AND MANY OF WHICH HE OF COURSE REDUCED TO PRACTICE

FOR THE SERVICE HE PAID $25 WEEKLY
IN NO ONE THING HAS MAN SHOWN GREATER FERTILITY OF INVENTION THAN IN LIGHTING
MILLIKEN SAID THAT IF HE WAS THAT KIND OF AN OPERATOR I COULD SEND FOR HIM AND I WROTE TO EDISON TO COME ON AS I HAD A JOB FOR HIM IN THE MAIN OFFICE OF THE WESTERN UNION MEANTIME EDISON HAD SECURED HIS PASS OVER THE GRAND TRUNK RAILROAD AND SPENT FOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS ON THE JOURNEY SUFFERING EXTREMES OF COLD AND HUNGER
IN VIEW OF THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE PROBLEM WHICH IN 1900 HE UNDERTOOK TO SOLVE IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO REVIEW HIS MENTAL ATTITUDE AT THAT PERIOD
I ARRIVED AT LOUISVILLE ON A BITTERLY COLD DAY WITH ICE IN THE GUTTERS
ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL THINGS THAT MADE THE SYSTEM A SUCCESS WAS THAT THE LINE WAS PUT TO EARTH AT THE SENDING END THROUGH A MAGNET AND THE EXTRA CURRENT FROM THIS PASSED TO THE LINE SERVED TO SHARPEN THE RECORDING WAVES
SONNY HE SAID IF THESE POLITICIANS HAD THEIR SPEECHES PUBLISHED AS THEY DELIVER THEM A GREAT MANY SHORTHAND WRITERS WOULD BE OUT OF A JOB
I HAD A LEVER HELD DOWN BY A POWERFUL SPRING AND A ROD ONE INCH IN DIAMETER AND FOUR FEET LONG
AND NOT ONLY MUST THESE CONVEYORS BE CAPABLE OF CARRYING THE MATERIAL BUT THEY MUST ALSO BE DEVISED SO THAT THEY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVE AND DISCHARGE THEIR RESPECTIVE LOADS AT APPOINTED PLACES
THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW WAS THAT I INSTALLED FOR HIM MY OLD CINCINNATI APPARATUS WHICH WAS USED THEREAFTER FOR MANY YEARS EDISON DID NOT MAKE A VERY LONG STAY IN CINCINNATI THIS TIME BUT WENT HOME AFTER A WHILE TO PORT HURON
A CEMENT FLOOR WAS LAID AND EVERY PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN TO RENDER THE BUILDING FREE FROM ALL MAGNETIC INFLUENCES SO THAT IT WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR ELECTRICAL WORK OF THE UTMOST ACCURACY AND PRECISION
IT WAS BY NO MIRACLE THAT EDISON WAS FAR AND AWAY AHEAD OF HIS TIME WHEN HE UNDERTOOK TO IMPROVE THE DYNAMO
MR ADAMS TELLS THIS INTERESTING STORY AS AN ILLUSTRATION
BERGMANN WAS A MAN OF GREAT EXECUTIVE ABILITY AND CARRIED ECONOMY OF MANUFACTURE TO THE LIMIT
FURNACEMEN OBJECT TO MORE THAN A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF FINE ORE IN THEIR MIXTURES PARTICULARLY WHEN THE ORE IS MAGNETIC NOT EASILY REDUCED
THIS LED TO AN INVESTIGATION BY THE MANAGER AND THE SCHEME WAS FORBIDDEN
HE SAW THE JOKE QUICKLY HOWEVER AND JOINED IN THE GENERAL MERRIMENT CAUSED BY THIS PRANK
BUT SOMETHING OCCURRED WHICH WAS VERY MUCH OUT OF THE ORDINARY
IT IS PROPOSED TO WORK AS A UNIT PLANT FOR SUCCESSFUL OPERATION AT LEAST SIX SETS OF MOLDS TO KEEP THE MEN BUSY AND THE MACHINERY GOING
ONE OF THE MAIN IMPRESSIONS LEFT UPON ME AFTER KNOWING MR EDISON FOR MANY YEARS IS THE MARVELLOUS ACCURACY OF HIS GUESSES
ONE OF THE MAIN IMPRESSIONS LEFT UPON ME AFTER KNOWING MR EDISON FOR MANY YEARS IS THE MARVELLOUS ACCURACY OF HIS GUESSES
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE MR EDISON HOW CAN I TELL
IN THE DOZEN YEARS FOLLOWING MR PORTER BUILT MANY ENGINES WITH CERTAIN COMMON CHARACTERISTICS--I.E HIGH PISTON SPEED AND REVOLUTIONS SOLID ENGINE BED AND BABBITT-METAL BEARINGS
BUT CONTINUES MR HARRINGTON IN A MEMORABLE AFFIDAVIT THE INVENTIVE EFFORTS OF MR EDISON WERE NOT CONFINED TO AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHY NOR DID THEY CEASE WITH THE OPENING OF THAT LINE TO WASHINGTON THEY ALL LED UP TO THE QUADRUPLEX
THAT HE HAS HAD THE USUAL EXPERIENCE IN RUNNING MACHINES WILL BE EVIDENCED BY THE FOLLOWING LITTLE STORY FROM MR MALLORY
AS THE PRINCIPLE INVOLVED IN THE RECEIVING OPERATION WAS ELECTROCHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION THE PAPER TAPE UPON WHICH THE INCOMING MESSAGE WAS TO BE RECEIVED WAS MOISTENED WITH A CHEMICAL SOLUTION READILY DECOMPOSABLE BY THE ELECTRIC CURRENT
NOR WERE THE VISITORS MERELY THOSE ON BUSINESS BENT
MY POWERS OF OBSERVATION WERE VERY MUCH IMPROVED AFTER THIS OCCURRENCE
IN A RAILROAD SYSTEM THERE ARE USUALLY TWO TERMINAL STATIONS AND A NUMBER OF WAY STATIONS
IT WORKED PRETTY WELL
IN THIS WE SEE THE MAN FORESHADOWED BY THE BOY WHO WHEN HE OBTAINED HIS BOOKS ON CHEMISTRY OR PHYSICS DID NOT ACCEPT ANY STATEMENT OF FACT OR EXPERIMENT THEREIN BUT WORKED OUT EVERY ONE OF THEM HIMSELF TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE TRUE
IT HAS SINCE BEEN CONTINUED UNDER HIS GENERAL DIRECTION AND OWNERSHIP AND HE HAS MADE A GREAT MANY ADDITIONAL INVENTIONS TENDING TO IMPROVE THE MACHINE IN ALL ITS PARTS
22 1880 239,152 SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING
HE CAME IN TWO OR THREE MONTHS AFTER AND SAID
IT HAS OFTEN BEEN LAID DOWN THAT A MERITORIOUS INVENTION IS NOT TO BE DEFEATED BY SOMETHING WHICH RESTS IN SPECULATION OR EXPERIMENT OR WHICH IS RUDIMENTARY OR INCOMPLETE
THERE WAS SOME LAW IT SEEMS THAT MADE A MONTHLY RENTER LIABLE FOR A YEAR
HIS CONSCIENCE SEEMED TO BE ATROPHIED BUT THAT MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS CONTENDING WITH MEN WHO NEVER HAD ANY TO BE ATROPHIED
AND APPARENTLY WITH HIS SAVINGS HE WENT TO PRINCETON WHERE HE STUDIED ELECTRICITY UNDER NO LESS A TEACHER THAN THE FAMOUS JOSEPH HENRY
I WAS IN THE HABIT OF MARKING THE PRICE I WOULD PAY ON EACH SKETCH
THE VIBRATIONS OF THE DIAPHRAGM COMMUNICATED TO THE VALVES CAUSE THEM TO OPERATE IN SYNCHRONISM SO THAT THE VIBRATIONS ARE THROWN UPON THE ESCAPING AIR OR STEAM
BUT IN THOSE DAYS THE AMOUNT WAS LARGE AND THE COMBINATION CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF NEWSPAPER COMMENT AS TO SUCH A COINAGE OF BRAIN POWER
I WAS NOT THE INVENTOR OF THE AUTO REPEATER BUT WHILE IN MEMPHIS I WORKED ON ONE
FOR A VERY SHORT TIME EDISON ALSO WAS THUS MISLED BUT AS SOON AS HE PERCEIVED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS ONE INVOLVING THE MULTIPLICATION OF CURRENT UNITS HIS BROAD CONCEPTION OF A SYSTEM WAS BORN
FROM ONE OF THE PRECEDING ITEMS IT WILL BE NOTED THAT EVEN IN THE EIGHTIES EDISON PERCEIVED MUCH ADVANTAGE TO BE GAINED IN THE LINE OF ECONOMY BY THE USE OF LAMP FILAMENTS EMPLOYING REFRACTORY METALS IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION
I THINK I MUST HAVE TRIED ABOUT EVERYTHING IN THOSE BOOKS
WHILE THE ARCS WITH PLAIN CARBONS ARE BLUISH-WHITE THOSE WITH CARBONS CONTAINING CALCIUM FLUORIDE HAVE A NOTABLE GOLDEN GLOW
THIS GAVE A STAY IN THAT CITY FROM 10 A.M
APPARENTLY THE GREATER PART OF HIS SPARE TIME WAS SPENT IN THE CELLAR FOR HE DID NOT SHARE TO ANY EXTENT IN THE SPORTS OF THE BOYS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD HIS CHUM AND CHIEF COMPANION MICHAEL OATES BEING A LAD OF DUTCH ORIGIN MANY YEARS OLDER WHO DID CHORES AROUND THE HOUSE AND WHO COULD BE RECRUITED AS A GENERAL UTILITY FRIDAY FOR THE EXPERIMENTS OF THIS YOUNG EXPLORER--SUCH AS THAT WITH THE SEIDLITZ POWDERS
THIS CAR WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PUT UPON THE STREET-CAR LINES IN NEW YORK CITY AND DEMONSTRATED ITS EFFICIENCY SO COMPLETELY THAT IT WAS PURCHASED BY ONE OF THE STREET-CAR COMPANIES WHICH HAS SINCE ORDERED ADDITIONAL CARS FOR ITS LINES
NO ONE EVER SAW HIM LAZY
DREYER TRIED TO ORGANIZE A COMPANY FOR ITS PURCHASE
IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES EDISON BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT THE EASTERN STEEL TRADE WAS SUFFERING A DISASTROUS CHANGE AND THAT BUSINESS WAS SLOWLY DRIFTING WESTWARD CHIEFLY BY REASON OF THE DISCOVERY AND OPENING UP OF ENORMOUS DEPOSITS OF HIGH-GRADE IRON ORE IN THE UPPER PENINSULA OF MICHIGAN
HE WAS MARRIED IN 1873 TO MISS MARY STILLWELL WHO DIED IN 1884 LEAVING THREE CHILDREN--THOMAS ALVA WILLIAM LESLIE AND MARION ESTELLE
THOUGH PLUNGED IN A VERITABLE MAELSTROM OF NEW AND IMPORTANT BUSINESS INTERESTS AND THOUGH APPLYING FOR NO FEWER THAN EIGHTY-NINE PATENTS IN 1881 ALL OF WHICH WERE GRANTED HE SUPERINTENDED ON THE SPOT ALL THIS LAYING OF UNDERGROUND CONDUCTORS FOR THE FIRST DISTRICT
HOW MANY FOOT-POUNDS OF ELECTRICITY CAN BE GOT OUT OF 100 FOOT-POUNDS OF MECHANICAL ENERGY
TO THE PUBLIC OF THAT DAY WHEN THE HIGHEST KNOWN FORM OF HOUSE ILLUMINANT WAS GAS THE INCANDESCENT LAMP WITH ITS ABILITY TO BURN IN ANY POSITION ITS LACK OF HEAT SO THAT YOU COULD PUT YOUR HAND ON THE BRILLIANT GLASS GLOBE
WITH THIS IDEA SUGGESTED ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT IT WOULD BE A SIMPLE MATTER TO MAKE MOLDS AND POUR IN A CONCRETE MIXTURE
HE SAT WITH THEM FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS DISCUSSING HIS WONDERFUL TRIP AND TELLING SOME FASCINATING STORIES OF ADVENTURE
NOBODY EVER HAD A BIGGER SCRAP-HEAP THAN EDISON
HE CHOSE THE DRUM FORM FOR HIS ARMATURE AND EXPERIMENTED WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF IRON
THERE IS ANOTHER BIG LIBRARY UP IN THE HOUSE ON THE HILL--IN FACT THERE ARE BOOKS UPON BOOKS ALL OVER THE HOME
WE WILL NAME A FEW OF THEM BRIEFLY
THE DESIRABILITY OF SUCH A DIGEST IS NOT TO BE DENIED BUT AS THERE ARE SOME TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED OR MORE INVENTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED INCLUDING THOSE COVERED BY CAVEATS THE TASK OF ITS PREPARATION WOULD BE STUPENDOUS
I MYSELF GOT A BLACK EYE
MR THEODORE PUSKAS OF BUDAPEST HUNGARY WAS THE FIRST MAN TO SUGGEST A TELEPHONE EXCHANGE AND SOON AFTER EXCHANGES WERE ESTABLISHED
WITH CONSEQUENT GAIN IN SPEED IN DELIVERY OF THE MESSAGE AFTER ITS RECEIPT IN THE OPERATING-ROOM IT BEING OBVIOUSLY NECESSARY IN THE CASE OF ANY MESSAGE RECEIVED IN MORSE CHARACTERS TO COPY IT IN SCRIPT BEFORE DELIVERY TO THE RECIPIENT
HOUSTON KENNELLY IN THEIR ELECTRICITY IN EVERYDAY LIFE SUM THE MATTER UP AS FOLLOWS
OLD SUITS WERE REVIVED AND NEW ONES INSTITUTED
TROUBLE DEVELOPED HOWEVER FOR THE REASON THAT WHILE CARBON WAS HARD AND WOULD WEAR AWAY THE MICA INSULATION SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE COPPER GRAPHITE BEING SOFTER WOULD WEAR AWAY ONLY THE COPPER LEAVING RIDGES OF MICA AND THUS CAUSING SPARKING THROUGH UNEQUAL CONTACT
JULY 28 1880 263,139 MANUFACTURE OF CARBONS FOR ELECTRIC LAMPS

MY AMBITION IS TO BUILD UP A GREAT INDUSTRIAL WORKS IN THE ORANGE VALLEY STARTING IN A SMALL WAY AND GRADUALLY WORKING UP IN THIS PLANT WHICH REPRESENTS AN INVESTMENT APPROXIMATING THE SUM OF $4,000,000 ARE GROUPED A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES OF WHICH EDISON IS EITHER THE SOLE OR CONTROLLING OWNER AND THE GUIDING SPIRIT
ANOTHER DIAGRAM WILL PROBABLY MAKE THIS MORE CLEAR
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE COMPLETE SYSTEM IN ALL ITS PARTS IS NOT COMPRISED IN THE FEW OF MR EDISON'S PATENTS OF WHICH SPECIFIC MENTION IS HERE MADE
WHEN IT WAS FOUND DIFFICULT TO PUSH THE CENTRAL-STATION BUSINESS OWING TO THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN ITS FINANCIAL SUCCESS EDISON DECIDED TO GO INTO THE BUSINESS OF PROMOTING AND CONSTRUCTING CENTRAL-STATION PLANTS AND HE FORMED WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE THOMAS A
THE WHEELS AND DRUM WERE ELECTRICALLY CONNECTED IN THE LINE OVER WHICH THE MESSAGE WAS TO BE SENT
THE WORD SYSTEM IS MUCH ABUSED IN INVENTION AND DURING THE EARLY DAYS OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING ITS USE APPLIED TO A MERE FREAKISH LAMP OR DYNAMO WAS OFTEN LUDICROUS
BUT ITS USE OFFERED NO ADVANTAGES AND THE HUNT WAS CONTINUED IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AND PURSUED UNTIL EDISON SATISFIED HIMSELF BY A VAST NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS THAT NICKEL AND IRON POSSESSED THE DESIRABLE QUALIFICATIONS HE WAS IN SEARCH OF
AMONG THE EXHIBITS OF THAT EXPOSITION WAS THE EDISON SYSTEM OF INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
THE APPARATUS WAS BUILT AND I LEFT THE WESTERN UNION EMPLOY AND WENT TO ROCHESTER NEW YORK TO TEST THE APPARATUS ON THE LINES OF THE ATLANTIC PACIFIC TELEGRAPH BETWEEN THAT CITY AND NEW YORK
IT CONTAINED WHAT WAS AT ONCE A FULL ELABORATE AND TERSE EXPLANATION OF A COMPLETE ISOLATED PLANT WITH DIAGRAMS OF VARIOUS METHODS OF CONNECTION AND OPERATION AND A CAREFULLY DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL PART ITS FUNCTIONS AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS
AND WE WERE COMPELLED TO STOP
MR MALLORY TELLS A CHARACTERISTIC STORY OF EDISON'S OWN SHARE IN THE MEMORABLE EXHIBIT
EDISON'S NATIVE SHREWDNESS AND KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE WAS PUT TO PRACTICAL USE IN THE BUSY DAYS OF PLANT CONSTRUCTION
A SUBSEQUENT ISSUE CONTAINED A SOMEWHAT ACRIMONIOUS LETTER OF CRITICISM BY A WELL-KNOWN MAKER OF DYNAMO MACHINES
A POPULAR IDEA OF EDISON THAT DIES HARD PICTURES A BREEZY SLAP-DASH ENERGETIC INVENTOR ARRIVING AT NEW RESULTS BY LUCK AND INTUITION MAKING BOASTFUL ASSERTIONS AND THEN WINNING OUT BY MERE CHANCE
IN FACT ON ACCOUNT OF HIS ASSUMED DELICACY HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO SCHOOL FOR SOME YEARS AND EVEN WHEN HE DID ATTEND FOR A SHORT TIME THE RESULTS WERE NOT ENCOURAGING--HIS MOTHER BEING HOTLY INDIGNANT UPON HEARING THAT THE TEACHER HAD SPOKEN OF HIM TO AN INSPECTOR AS ADDLED THE YOUTH WAS INDEED FORTUNATE FAR BEYOND THE ORDINARY IN HAVING A MOTHER AT ONCE LOVING WELL-INFORMED AND AMBITIOUS CAPABLE HERSELF FROM HER EXPERIENCE AS A TEACHER OF UNDERTAKING AND GIVING HIM AN EDUCATION BETTER THAN COULD BE SECURED IN THE LOCAL SCHOOLS OF THE DAY
AFTER STAYING THERE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS THE TRAINMEN MADE SNOWSHOES OF FENCE-RAIL SPLINTS AND STARTED OUT TO FIND FOOD WHICH THEY DID ABOUT A HALF MILE AWAY
THE COPPER WIRES CONNECTING THE INSTRUMENTS TO THE SWITCHBOARD WERE SMALL CRYSTALLIZED AND ROTTEN
NO DREAD OF FIRE AND ALL AT A RENTAL WHICH EDISON BELIEVES WILL BE NOT MORE BUT PROBABLY LESS THAN $10 PER MONTH IN ANY CITY OF THE UNITED STATES
WELL IT'S ALL GONE BUT WE HAD A HELL OF A GOOD TIME SPENDING IT WITH WHICH REVELATION OF AN ATTITUDE WORTHY OF MARK TAPLEY HIMSELF THIS CHAPTER MAY WELL CONCLUDE
AS THE 1880 ROAD WAS BUILT VERY SOON AFTER EDISON'S NOTABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN DYNAMO MACHINES AND AS THE ART OF OPERATING THEM TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE WAS THEN BEING DEVELOPED THIS EARLY ROAD WAS SOMEWHAT CRUDE AS COMPARED WITH THE RAILROAD OF 1882
IT WAS A VERY HOT DAY IN SUMMER THE VISITOR WAS IN FULL SOCIAL REGALIA OF SILK HAT AND FROCK-COAT AND INSISTED THAT HE COULD DELIVER THE MEDAL ONLY INTO EDISON'S HANDS
THOSE DAYS WERE HEROIC ONES FOR HE THEN BATTLED AGAINST MIGHTY ODDS AND THE PROSPECTS WERE DIM AND NOT VERY ENCOURAGING
IT WAS NOT A COMPLETE METALLIC ENCLOSING SHELL

MR EDISON THEN ASKED
THIS EXPLANATION WILL NECESSARILY BE OF SOMEWHAT ELEMENTARY CHARACTER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LAY READER WHOSE INDULGENCE IS ASKED FOR AN OCCASIONAL REITERATION INTRODUCED FOR THE SAKE OF CLEARNESS OF COMPREHENSION
HE SAT DOWN AND TURNING TO ME SAID
THESE WILL BE FOUND IN THE FOLLOWING EXTRACTS FROM ONE OF THE NOTE-BOOKS AND CONSIST OF EDISON'S INSTRUCTIONS TO BE CARRIED OUT IN DETAIL BY HIS EXPERIMENTERS
I CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF BUILDING A VERY LIGHT RAILROAD OF NARROW GAUGE AND HAD GOT ALL THE DATA AS TO THE WINDS ON THE PLAINS AND FOUND THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITH VERY LARGE WINDMILLS TO SUPPLY ENOUGH POWER TO DRIVE THOSE WHEAT TRAINS AMONG OTHERS WHO VISITED THE LITTLE ROAD AT THIS JUNCTURE WERE PERSONS INTERESTED IN THE MANHATTAN ELEVATED SYSTEM OF NEW YORK ON WHICH EXPERIMENTS WERE REPEATEDLY TRIED LATER BUT WHICH WAS NOT DESTINED TO ADOPT A METHOD SO OBVIOUSLY WELL SUITED TO ALL THE CONDITIONS UNTIL AFTER MANY SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATIONS HAD BEEN MADE ON ELEVATED ROADS ELSEWHERE
ALTHOUGH EDISON'S ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE WAY OF IMPROVED PROCESSES AND MACHINERY HAVE ALREADY MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION IN THE CEMENT INDUSTRY IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS IMPRESSION WILL BECOME STILL MORE PROFOUNDLY STAMPED UPON IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH THE EXPLOITATION OF HIS POURED CEMENT HOUSE THE BROAD PROBLEM WHICH HE SET HIMSELF WAS TO PROVIDE HANDSOME AND PRACTICALLY INDESTRUCTIBLE DETACHED HOUSES WHICH COULD BE TAKEN BY WAGE-EARNERS AT VERY MODERATE MONTHLY RENTALS
YET WITH THE MOTION PICTURE EFFECTS ARE SECURED THAT COULD NOT BE REPRODUCED TO THE SLIGHTEST EXTENT ON THE REAL STAGE

I WOULDN'T GIVE A PENNY FOR THE ORDINARY COLLEGE GRADUATE EXCEPT THOSE FROM THE INSTITUTES OF TECHNOLOGY
IN EDISON'S SYSTEM OF AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHY A PAPER TAPE WAS PERFORATED WITH A SERIES OF ROUND HOLES SO ARRANGED AND SPACED AS TO REPRESENT MORSE CHARACTERS FORMING THE WORDS OF THE MESSAGE TO BE TRANSMITTED

WHEREUPON THERE WAS RATHER A STORMY TIME FOR A WHILE BUT NOTHING WAS PUBLISHED ABOUT IT
FOR INSTANCE THE ELECTROLYTE BEING A CONSTANT FACTOR AS EXPLAINED IS NOT REQUIRED IN ANY FIXED AND LARGE AMOUNT AS IS THE CASE WITH SULPHURIC ACID IN THE LEAD BATTERY
BY USE OF THAT LAW WE KNEW IN ADVANCE THAT IS TO SAY WHEN THE ORIGINAL PLANS FOR THE STATION WERE DRAWN JUST WHAT THIS LOSS WOULD BE PRECISELY THE SAME AS A MECHANICAL ENGINEER WHEN CONSTRUCTING A MILL WITH LONG LINES OF SHAFTING CAN FORECAST THE LOSS OF POWER DUE TO FRICTION
HE WORKED INCESSANTLY UNTIL 12 OR 1 O'CLOCK AT NIGHT

THE ARMATURE RESISTANCE WAS 0.0092 OHM 28 OF WHICH 0.0055 OHM WAS IN THE ARMATURE BARS AND 0.0037 OHM IN THE END-DISKS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE NEXT LATEST TYPE OF THIS MACHINE IS PRESENTED IN FIG
WHILE IT IS ONLY A GUESS THAT PERHAPS CHAUCER WOULD SOUND MUCH MORE MODERN THAN HE SCANS
IT IS CONCEDED THAT THE EDISON TRANSMITTER AS APPARATUS IS A VERY IMPORTANT INVENTION

EDISON BY HIS INVENTION OF THE THREE-WIRE SYSTEM OVERCAME THIS DIFFICULTY ENTIRELY AND AT THE SAME TIME CONSERVED APPROXIMATELY THE SAVING OF COPPER AS WILL BE APPARENT FROM THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATION OF THAT SYSTEM IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM
HIS LITTLE CATECHISM OF CURIOUS INQUIRY WAS EMBRACED IN FOUR SMALL AND INTENSELY ANGLO-SAXON WORDS--WITH HIS USUAL PLEASANT SMILE HE EXTENDED HIS HAND AND SAID

THERE WAS INDEED PROMPT APPRECIATION IN SOME WELL-INFORMED QUARTERS OF WHAT EDISON WAS DOING EVIDENCED BY THE SENSATION CAUSED IN THE SUMMER OF 1881 WHEN HE DESIGNED BUILT AND SHIPPED TO PARIS FOR THE FIRST ELECTRICAL EXPOSITION EVER HELD THE LARGEST DYNAMO THAT HAD BEEN BUILT UP TO THAT TIME
AS A MATTER OF FACT THE CONDITIONS AT LOUISVILLE AT THAT TIME WERE NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THEY HAD BEEN AT MEMPHIS
EDISON'S PHILOSOPHIC VIEW OF AFFAIRS IS GIVEN IN THE FOLLOWING ANECDOTE FROM MR MALLORY
SIMULTANEOUSLY AND OF COURSE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FOREGOING ACTIONS THE HOME NEUTRAL RELAY ITSELF MAY HAVE HAD ITS MAGNETISM REVERSED SEVERAL TIMES AND THE SIGNAL THAT IS THE DASH WILL HAVE BEEN MADE PARTLY BY THE HOME BATTERY PARTLY BY THE DISTANT AND HOME BATTERIES COMBINED PARTLY BY CURRENT ON THE MAIN LINE PARTLY BY CURRENT ON THE ARTIFICIAL LINE PARTLY BY THE MAIN-LINE STATIC CURRENT PARTLY BY THE CONDENSER STATIC CURRENT AND YET ON A WELL-ADJUSTED CIRCUIT THE DASH WILL HAVE BEEN PRODUCED ON THE QUADRUPLEX SOUNDER AS CLEARLY AS ANY DASH ON AN ORDINARY SINGLE-WIRE SOUNDER WE PRESENT A DIAGRAMMATIC ILLUSTRATION OF THE EDISON QUADRUPLEX BATTERY KEY SYSTEM IN FIG
GREEN A JOBBING MACHINIST OF KALAMAZOO MICHIGAN BUILT SMALL CARS AND TRACKS TO WHICH CURRENT WAS FED FROM A DISTANT BATTERY ENOUGH ENERGY BEING UTILIZED TO HAUL ONE HUNDRED POUNDS OF FREIGHT OR ONE PASSENGER UP AND DOWN A ROAD TWO HUNDRED FEET LONG
HE ASKED ME HOW MUCH I WANTED
WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE IT UP A TEST OPERATOR NAMED BROWN WHO WAS ON THE AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH WIRE BETWEEN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON WHICH PASSED THROUGH MY NEWARK SHOP ASKED PERMISSION TO LET HIM TRY AND SEE IF HE COULDN'T GET SUBSCRIBERS
AS EACH LAMP REQUIRES AND TAKES ITS OWN PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL CURRENT GENERATED IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE SIZE OF THE CONDUCTORS TO CARRY THE CURRENT FOR A NUMBER OF LAMPS MUST BE AS LARGE AS THE SUM OF ALL THE SEPARATE CONDUCTORS WHICH WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CARRY THE NECESSARY AMOUNT OF CURRENT TO EACH LAMP SEPARATELY
WHEN A FURTHER SCENE IN THE PLAY TAKES PLACE IN THE SAME SETTING AND WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS POSITION IN THE PLOT IT IS TAKEN UP REHEARSED AND PHOTOGRAPHED IN THE SAME WAY AND AFTERWARD ALL THE SCENES ARE CEMENTED TOGETHER IN THE PROPER SEQUENCE AND FORM THE COMPLETE NEGATIVE
THE REAR ROOM WHICH WAS DIRECTLY BACK OF THE FRONT ENTRANCE HALL WAS EDISON'S OFFICE AND THERE I FIRST SAW HIM
THEN THERE WAS A CESSATION OF ALL SIGNALS
INTO SUCH TIMES THOMAS ALVA EDISON WAS BORN AND HIS RELATIONS TO THEM AND TO THE EVENTS OF THE PAST SIXTY YEARS ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS NARRATIVE
THE LIMITS IMPOSED PRACTICALLY WERE SUCH AS TO REQUIRE THAT THE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT COST MORE THAN A CABLE ROAD TO INSTALL
THE COMPLETE AND EASY TRANSITION IS THE CONSTANT WONDER OF HIS ASSOCIATES FOR THERE IS NO CONFUSION OF IDEAS RESULTING FROM THESE QUICK CHANGES NO HESITATION OR APPARENT EFFORT BUT A PLUNGE INTO THE MIDST OF THE NEW SUBJECT AND AN INSTANT ACQUAINTANCE WITH ALL ITS DETAILS AS IF HE HAD BEEN STUDYING IT FOR HOURS

ONE DAY THINKING HE MIGHT BE CONFINED IN A ROOM FACING THE OFFICE I PUT MY ARM OUT OF THE WINDOW AND KEPT SIGNALLING DOTS AND DASHES BY THE MOVEMENT OF THE ARM
ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF HIS SALARY WAS USED UP IN PAYING FOR PITCHERS ONE DAY A REQUEST REACHED THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH OFFICE IN BOSTON FROM THE PRINCIPAL OF A SELECT SCHOOL FOR YOUNG LADIES TO THE EFFECT THAT SHE WOULD LIKE SOME ONE TO BE SENT UP TO THE SCHOOL TO EXHIBIT AND DESCRIBE THE MORSE TELEGRAPH TO HER CHILDREN THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A WARM INTEREST IN BOSTON IN THE LIFE AND WORK OF MORSE WHO WAS BORN THERE AT CHARLESTOWN BARELY A MILE FROM THE BIRTHPLACE OF FRANKLIN AND THIS REQUEST FOR A LITTLE LECTURE ON MORSE'S TELEGRAPH WAS QUITE NATURAL
I ACCEPTED PROVIDING HE WOULD PAY IT AT THE RATE OF $6000 A YEAR FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS
WE SOON LEARNED THAT THE RICH GRAVEL INSTEAD OF BEING SPREAD OVER AN AREA OF THREE BY SEVEN MILES AND RICH FROM THE GRASS ROOTS DOWN WAS SPREAD OVER A SPACE OF ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE ACRES AND THAT EVEN THIS DID NOT AVERAGE MORE THAN TEN CENTS TO THE CUBIC YARD
223,898 THE PRESENT NARRATIVE WOULD ASSUME THE PROPORTIONS OF A HISTORY OF THE INCANDESCENT LAMP SHOULD THE AUTHORS ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW EDISON'S INVESTIGATIONS THROUGH THE THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF NOTE-BOOKS AWAY BACK IN THE EIGHTIES AND EARLY NINETIES
THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE LITTLE GAS-ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING
BUT JUST THEN HE FOUND ALSO THAT FRUIT-GARDENING WAS THE THING AND DROPPED THE SUBJECT
THE GENESIS OF HIS INVENTION MR CALLAHAN HAS TOLD IN AN INTERESTING WAY
THIS MAN I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS WILBUR F
DEVICE AND METHOD FOR TELEGRAPHING PHOTOGRAPHICALLY
EXAMPLES OF THE MINUTENESS OF DETAIL INTO WHICH HIS RESEARCHES EXTEND HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED AND AS THERE ARE ALWAYS A NUMBER OF SUCH INVESTIGATIONS IN PROGRESS AT THE LABORATORY THIS ABILITY STANDS EDISON IN GOOD STEAD FOR HE IS THUS ENABLED TO FOLLOW AND IF NECESSARY CORRECT EACH ONE STEP BY STEP
TO ALL THE COAL-FIELDS AND ALL THE WATERFALLS FARADAY HAD DIRECTLY HITCHED THE WHEELS OF INDUSTRY
A SWITCH IN THE ARMATURE CIRCUIT ENABLED THE MOTORMAN TO REVERSE THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL BY REVERSING THE CURRENT FLOW THROUGH THE ARMATURE COILS
IT IS MATTER OF RECORD THAT HE DID ONCE BUY A NEW SUIT FOR THIRTY DOLLARS IN BOSTON BUT THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY WHILE EXPERIMENTING WITH ACIDS IN HIS LITTLE WORKSHOP THE SUIT WAS SPOILED
AND A COMBINATION OF ASPHALTUM AND LINSEED OIL WAS FORCED INTO THE PIPE FOR THE INSULATION
ALBUMEN FROM EGGS 2 LBS
THE BATTERY ITSELF SOON UNDERWENT MODIFICATIONS AND NEW TYPES WERE EVOLVED--THE STORAGE THE DOUBLE-FLUID AND THE DRY
IT IS TRUE THAT THE INCOME OF THE CENTRAL STATIONS IS NOW OVER $300,000,000 A YEAR AND THAT ISOLATED-PLANT LIGHTING REPRESENTS ALSO A LARGE AMOUNT OF DIVERTED BUSINESS
IT IS A LONG WALK ISN'T IT YES RATHER HE SAID
THE AUTHORS OF THE BOOK ARE PROFOUNDLY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY PERIOD OF ELECTRICAL DEVELOPMENT EMBRACED IN IT HAS BEEN PROLIFIC OF GREAT MEN
BEFORE US LIES AN UNDEVELOPED LAND OF OPPORTUNITY WHICH IS DESTINED TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE GROWTH AND WELFARE OF THE HUMAN RACE
28 1880 369,280 SYSTEM OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION
IN TESTING DYNAMOS AT GOERCK STREET WE HAD A LONG FLAT BELT RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE FLOOR ABOUT FOUR INCHES ABOVE IT AND TRAVELLING FOUR THOUSAND FEET A MINUTE
THE GREAT ATTRACTION HOWEVER WAS THE DISPLAY OF THE PERFECTED PHONOGRAPH
I STILL SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS AND LOST MORE MONEY THAT YEAR THAN ANY OTHER BECAUSE THE SALES WERE INCREASING RAPIDLY
THUS HE WAS LED TO ORIGINATE INNOVATIONS IN PROCESSES SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN PRESERVED AS TRADE SECRETS
WHEN EXPERIMENTING WITH VACUUM-PUMPS TO EXHAUST THE INCANDESCENT LAMPS I REQUIRED SOME VERY DELICATE AND CLOSE MANIPULATION OF GLASS AND HIRED A GERMAN GLASS-BLOWER WHO WAS SAID TO BE THE MOST EXPERT MAN OF HIS KIND IN THE UNITED STATES
AND HERE THAT ANOTHER DISTINGUISHED ENGINEER AND INVENTOR MR H

HE WALKED BACKWARD AND FORWARD ABOUT A MINUTE THEN COMING UP TO MY TABLE PUT HIS FIST DOWN AND SAID
AT AN EARLY STAGE OF THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT A STANDARDIZING COMMITTEE WAS FORMED CONSISTING OF THE HEADS OF ALL THE DEPARTMENTS AND TO THIS BODY WAS INTRUSTED THE TASK OF TESTING AND CRITICISING ALL EXISTING AND PROPOSED DEVICES AS WELL AS OF CONSIDERING THE SUGGESTIONS AND COMPLAINTS OF WORKMEN OFFERED FROM TIME TO TIME
AND THE MATTER WAS RATHER POOH-POOHED
I BELIEVE THAT THE ENGINE DRIVING THE FOUR Z GENERATORS AT THE POWER-HOUSE INDICATED AS HIGH AS SEVENTY HORSE-POWER AT THE TIME THE LOCOMOTIVE WAS ACTUALLY IN SERVICE THE ELECTRICAL FEATURES OF THE 1882 LOCOMOTIVE WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE EARLIER ONE ALREADY DESCRIBED
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE TIME TAKEN BY THE COURT WOULD BE ENORMOUSLY LESS BECAUSE IF A JUDGE ATTEMPTS TO READ THE BULKY RECORDS AND BRIEFS THAT WORK ALONE WOULD REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS
SUCH ARE ALSO PRACTICALLY THE METHODS OF TO-DAY
ONE DISTINCT GROUP OF VISITORS HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSTITUTED BY THE NEWSPAPER MEN HARDLY A DAY GOES BY THAT THE JOURNALS DO NOT CONTAIN SOME REFERENCE TO EDISON'S WORK OR REMARKS
IN FACT AFTER SUCH A CONTROVERSY BOTH PARTIES GOING AFTER EACH OTHER HAMMER AND TONGS THE ARGUMENTS TO HIM BEING CARRIED ON AT THE VERY TOP OF ONE'S VOICE TO ENABLE HIM TO HEAR AND FROM HIM BEING EQUALLY LOUD IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE DISCUSSION HE HAS OFTEN SAID
PROLONGED AND EXHAUSTIVE EXPERIMENT MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION AND AN INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF WOOD AND PLANT FIBRES HOWEVER HAD LED EDISON TO THE CONCLUSION THAT BAMBOO OR SIMILAR FIBROUS FILAMENTS WERE MORE SUITABLE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THEN KNOWN FOR COMMERCIAL INCANDESCENT LAMPS AND HE WANTED THE MOST PERFECT FOR THAT PURPOSE
BUT HE THEN BEGAN TO DEVOTE SERIOUS ATTENTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMPROVED TYPE THAT SHOULD BE OF GREATER COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE
AMONG THE INTERESTING DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS PROCESS WAS THE COATING OF THE ORIGINAL OR MASTER RECORD WITH A HOMOGENEOUS FILM OF GOLD SO THIN THAT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THESE PILED ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER WOULD PRESENT A THICKNESS OF ONLY ONE INCH

AFTER GETTING OUR LUNCH AND UPON REACHING THE SIDEWALK BORST OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SAID
HIS HAIR WAS WORN QUITE LONG AND HANGING CARELESSLY OVER HIS FINE FOREHEAD
THERE WERE A GOOD MANY AND WE LOST MORE MONEY THE SECOND YEAR THAN THE FIRST
THUS ALLOWING A COILED SPRING TO ACT ON A PIVOTED SHAFT CARRYING A TINY MIRROR
THE HOUR HAD COME FOR THE OLD LABORATORY FORCE THAT HAD DONE SUCH BRILLIANT AND MEMORABLE WORK TO DISBAND NEVER AGAIN TO ASSEMBLE UNDER LIKE CONDITIONS FOR LIKE EFFORT ALTHOUGH ITS MEMBERS ALL REMAINED ACTIVE IN THE FIELD AND MANY HAVE EVER SINCE BEEN ASSOCIATED PROMINENTLY WITH SOME DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL ENTERPRISE
THE OPENING YEARS OF QUEEN VICTORIA'S REIGN WITNESSED A BELATED EFFORT IN CANADA TO EMPHASIZE THE PRINCIPLE THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION
I NEVER ATTEMPTED TO SYSTEMATIZE EDISON'S BUSINESS LIFE
THE FIRST COLD DAY AFTER STARTING THE STATION PEOPLE BEGAN TO COME IN FROM THEIR OFFICES ESPECIALLY DOWN IN FRONT STREET AND WATER STREET SAYING THE METER WAS ON FIRE
FROM THE DIAGRAM IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE ARMATURE OF THE LATTER HAS A LONG PIVOTED EXTENSION ARM OR PLATEN TROUGH-LIKE IN SHAPE IN WHICH THE PAPER TAPE RUNS
THE CIRCUIT BACK TO THE TRACK OR OTHER RAIL BEING CLOSED THROUGH THE OTHER WHEELS IN A SIMILAR MANNER
I'M GOING TO HUNT FREQUENTLY EDISON HAS BEEN ASKED WHAT HE CONSIDERS THE SECRET OF ACHIEVEMENT
HERE WERE TWO MACHINES DESTINED TO BE JOINED TOGETHER ECONOMIZING SPACE ENHANCING ECONOMY AUGMENTING CAPACITY REDUCING INVESTMENT AND INCREASING DIVIDENDS
1 WIRE
THERE WERE TWO DIAPHRAGMS ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE CYLINDER ONE BEING FOR RECORDING AND THE OTHER FOR REPRODUCING SPEECH OR OTHER SOUNDS
IT MAY BE STATED AS BROADLY TRUE THAT EDISON ENGINEERED TO HANDLE IMMENSE MASSES OF STUFF AUTOMATICALLY WHILE HIS PREDECESSORS AIMED CHIEFLY AT CLOSE SEPARATION
THE FINE GRINDING OF CEMENT CLINKER IS DISTINCTIVELY EDISONIAN IN BOTH ORIGIN AND APPLICATION
ONE OF THE PRELIMINARY STEPS TAKEN TO ENABLE HIM TO FIGURE ON SUCH A STATION AND SYSTEM WAS TO HAVE MEN GO THROUGH THIS DISTRICT ON VARIOUS DAYS AND NOTE THE NUMBER OF GAS JETS BURNING AT EACH HOUR UP TO TWO OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
AND MANY MORE STARTLING AND APPARENTLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE EFFECTS ARE CARRIED OUT WITH ACTUAL REALITY BY STOP-WORK PHOTOGRAPHY

JUNE 25 1883 297,582 DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE
FOR INSTANCE HE MAY HAVE BEEN BUSY FOR HOURS ON CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS AND BE CALLED UPON SUDDENLY TO DETERMINE SOME MECHANICAL QUESTIONS
HE TOOK HOLD PERFORMED THE FEAT AND I PAID HIM THE $10,000
NOT ONLY DID HE DEVELOP THOROUGHLY THE REFINING OF THE CRUSHED ORE SO THAT AFTER IT HAD PASSED THE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MAGNETS IN THE MILL THE CONCENTRATES CAME OUT FINALLY CONTAINING 91 TO 93 PER CENT
SIXTY OF THE MEN EMPLOYED AT THE LABORATORY WERE USED AS WATCHERS EACH TO KEEP AN EYE ON A CERTAIN SECTION OF THE EXHIBIT AND SEE THERE WAS NO MONKEYING WITH IT
THE BUSINESS HAD NOT THEN REALLY MADE A START AND BEING ENTIRELY NEW WAS WITHOUT PRECEDENT UPON WHICH TO BASE ANY SUCH STATEMENT BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT THE RECORDS OF THE LAMP FACTORY SHOW THAT IN 1896 ITS DAILY OUTPUT OF LAMPS WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND
AS TO THE PHONOGRAPH THE PREDICTION WENT ONLY SO FAR AS THE RESULT
THIS CONDITION WAS NOT UNUSUAL AT ONE TIME
THE ONE NEAREST THE VALLEY ROAD IS CALLED THE GALVANOMETER-ROOM AND WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED BY EDISON TO BE USED FOR THE MOST DELICATE AND MINUTE ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS
AND ONE OF THE GREATEST INVENTIONS OF THE CENTURY WAS COMPLETED
WITH EDISON'S TELEPHONE A CLOSED CIRCUIT IS USED ON WHICH IS CONSTANTLY FLOWING A BATTERY CURRENT AND INCLUDED IN THAT CIRCUIT IS A PAIR OF ELECTRODES ONE OR BOTH OF WHICH IS OF CARBON
8 1883 307,030 ELECTRICAL METER AUG
DURING THE TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS THAT HAVE INTERVENED IT HAS NEVER COME BACK THIS INCIDENT WAS REALLY THE PRELUDE TO THE DEVELOPMENT SET FORTH IN THIS CHAPTER
WE HAVE ALREADY POINTED OUT TWO INSTANCES WHERE IN HIS DEALINGS WITH THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY HE STIPULATED THAT PAYMENTS OF $6000 PER YEAR FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS WERE TO BE MADE INSTEAD OF $100,000 IN CASH EVIDENTLY FORGETFUL OF THE FACT THAT THE ANNUAL SUM SO RECEIVED WAS NOTHING MORE THAN LEGAL INTEREST WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN EARNED INDEFINITELY IF THE CAPITAL HAD BEEN ONLY INSISTED UPON
BY THE USE OF STORAGE-BATTERY CARS THIS IMMENSE AND UNECONOMICAL MAXIMUM INVESTMENT IN PLANT CAN BE CUT DOWN TO PROPORTIONS OF TRUE COMMERCIAL ECONOMY AS THE CHARGING OF THE BATTERIES CAN BE CONDUCTED AT A UNIFORM RATE WITH A REASONABLE EXPENDITURE FOR GENERATING MACHINERY
IT PRESENTS A NEW APPEARANCE
THE COCKROACHES MOVING UP ON THE WALL WOULD PASS OVER THE STRIPS
BUT BESIDE IT NO SUPERIOR VARIETIES WERE FOUND

THE ARMATURE OR MOVING PART OF THE MACHINE CONSISTS IN REALITY OF EIGHT SEPARATE ARMATURES ALL CONSTRUCTED OF CORRUGATED SHEET IRON COVERED WITH ASBESTOS AND WOUND WITH WIRE
THIS DEPARTMENT OCCUPIES AN UPPER STORY IN A LOFTY BUILDING AND IN ITS VARIOUS ROOMS MAY BE SEEN AND HEARD MANY PROMINENT MUSICIANS VOCALISTS SPEAKERS AND VAUDEVILLE ARTISTS STUDIOUSLY AND BUSILY ENGAGED IN MAKING THE ORIGINAL RECORDS WHICH ARE AFTERWARD SENT TO ORANGE AND WHICH IF APPROVED BY THE EXPERT COMMITTEE ARE PASSED ON TO THE PROPER DEPARTMENT FOR REPRODUCTION IN LARGE QUANTITIES

THE CARBON ELECTRODE WAS THE INVENTION OF EDISON
HE WAS A FINE OPERATOR AND WROTE A BEAUTIFUL HAND
WE HAD ENORMOUS ORDERS AND LITTLE MONEY AND HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY TO MEET OUR PAYROLLS AND BUY SUPPLIES
HENCE IT IS NOT PROPOSED TO ENCUMBER THIS NARRATIVE WITH ANY DETAILED RECORD OF THE NUMEROUS SUITS THAT WERE BROUGHT AND CONDUCTED THROUGH THEIR COMPLICATED RAMIFICATIONS BY EMINENT COUNSEL
SUCH IS THE CONDITION OF OUR LAWS AND PRACTICE THAT THE PATENTEE IN SEEKING TO ENFORCE HIS RIGHTS LABORS UNDER A TERRIBLE HANDICAP

WILL THAT BOAT LIVE IN THAT SEA OH YES HE SAID BUT WE'VE HAD A BAD STORM SO I MADE UP MY MIND THAT PERHAPS I WOULD GET SICK THIS TIME
REFERENCE HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS CHAPTER TO THE PRELIMINARY STUDY THAT EDISON BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAS ART AND INDUSTRY
FROM THIS TANK A LARGE NUMBER OF OPEN TROUGHS OR PIPES LEAD THE MIXTURE TO VARIOUS OPENINGS IN THE ROOF WHENCE IT FLOWS DOWN AND FILLS ALL PARTS OF THE MOLD FROM THE FOOTING IN THE BASEMENT UNTIL IT OVERFLOWS AT THE TIP OF THE ROOF
CRUDE TELEGRAPHY REPRESENTED WHAT WAS KNOWN OF IT PRACTICALLY AND ABOUT THAT THE BOOKS READ BY YOUNG EDISON WERE NOT REDUNDANTLY INFORMATIONAL

THIS IS A MINIATURE COPY OF THE ORANGE LABORATORY WITH ITS MACHINE SHOP CHEMICAL-ROOM AND GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL DEPARTMENT

WE TOOK A LONG IRON WIRE ONE-SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER AND RUBBED IT LENGTHWAYS WITH A PIECE OF LEATHER WITH RESIN ON FOR ABOUT THREE FEET BACKWARD AND FORWARD
I HAVE DESIGNED A CONCENTRATING PLANT AND BUILT A MACHINE SHOP ETC ETC
THE QUADRUPLEX AND PHONOPLEX EDISON'S WORK IN STOCK PRINTERS AND TELEGRAPHY HAD MARKED HIM AS A RISING MAN IN THE ELECTRICAL ART OF THE PERIOD BUT HIS INVENTION OF QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPHY IN 1874 WAS WHAT BROUGHT HIM VERY PROMINENTLY BEFORE THE NOTICE OF THE PUBLIC
THE TESTING OF IRON FOR MAGNETIC QUALITIES BEING DETERMINED BY IT IN THE SAME WAY
19 1906 964,096 PROCESSES OF ELECTRO-PLATING FEB
AND IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS CIPHER OF ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED WORDS OR SO SHOULD BE GOT THROUGH IMMEDIATELY TO GENERAL THOMAS
IT SEEMED APPARENT THEREFORE THAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE DESIRED SPEED THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SACRIFICED THAT FINENESS OF EMULSION NECESSARY FOR THE SECURING OF SHARP PICTURES
THE CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA OF EACH BAR WAS 0.2 SQUARE INCH THEIR AVERAGE LENGTH WAS 42.7 INCHES AND THE COPPER END-DISKS WERE 0.065 INCH THICK
ALTHOUGH WORK HAD BEEN BEGUN SO EARLY IN THE YEAR AND THE ROAD HAD BEEN OPERATING SINCE MAY IT WAS NOT UNTIL JULY THAT EDISON EXECUTED ANY APPLICATION FOR PATENTS ON HIS ELECTROMAGNETIC RAILWAY ENGINE OR HIS INGENIOUS BRAKING SYSTEM
LAMP-HOLDERS FIXTURES AND THE LIKE
THESE SEVERE REQUIREMENTS WERE STAGGERING BUT MR EDISON'S COURAGE DID NOT FALTER
IN ONE INSTANCE SPOKEN WORDS AND THE SINGING OF SONGS ORIGINATING AT A DISTANCE WERE HEARD PERFECTLY BY AN AUDIENCE OF OVER FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE
ALSO THAT WHEREAS EDISON GETS SIX OR EVEN SEVEN LIGHTS TO THE HORSE-POWER IN ISOLATED PLANTS THE RESISTANCE OF THE LONG UNDERGROUND WIRES REDUCES THAT RESULT IN THE PEARL STREET STATION TO LESS THAN THREE LIGHTS TO THE HORSE-POWER BOTH OF THESE STATEMENTS ARE FALSE
WRIGHT AFTERWARD U
TELEGRAPH OPERATORS WERE NATURALLY IN TOUCH WITH THIS MOVEMENT AND EDISON'S FERTILE IMAGINATION WAS READILY INFLAMED BY THE GLOWING IDEA OF ALL THESE VAGUE POSSIBILITIES
ASSOCIATED WITH POPE AND ASHLEY HE FOLLOWED UP HIS WORK ON TELEGRAPH PRINTERS WITH MARKED SUCCESS
THE BOY BEGAN EXPERIMENTING WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN YEARS OF AGE
THESE PINS CORRESPOND IN NUMBER TO THE CHARACTERS ON THE TYPE-WHEELS
THE FEEDER CONNECTIONS WERE ALL AT THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING AND THE GENERAL VOLTAGE CONTROL APPARATUS WAS ON THE FLOOR ABOVE
HE ALSO FOUND THAT OVER THE SAME WIRE AT THE SAME TIME ANOTHER SERIES OF IMPULSES CORRESPONDING TO ANOTHER NOTE COULD BE SENT THROUGH THE AGENCY OF A SECOND SET OF MAGNETS WITHOUT IN ANY WAY INTERFERING WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF IMPULSES
DICK OF CHICAGO
AS THE PERFORATED TAPE PASSES OVER THE TRANSMISSION DRUM THE ADVANCED ROLLERS 6 OR 8 FIRST CLOSE THE CIRCUIT THROUGH THE PERFORATIONS AND A POSITIVE CURRENT PASSES FROM THE BATTERIES THROUGH THE DRUM AND DOWN TO THE GROUND
THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT IS DILETTANTE ABOUT ALL THIS
LET US NOT THINK TOO LIGHTLY OF THE HUMBLE FIVE-CENT THEATRE WITH ITS GAPING CROWD FOLLOWING WITH BREATHLESS INTEREST THE VICISSITUDES OF THE BEAUTIFUL HEROINE
AT FIRST NOTATIONS IN CHALK ON A BLACKBOARD SUFFICED BUT SEEING THEIR INADEQUACY DR S
HE WAS THEN AN ORDINARY-LOOKING YOUNG FELLOW SAYS MR OTT DIRTY AS ANY OF THE OTHER WORKMEN UNKEMPT AND NOT MUCH BETTER DRESSED THAN A TRAMP BUT I IMMEDIATELY FELT THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL IN HIM THIS IS THE CONVERSATION THAT ENSUED LED BY MR EDISON'S QUESTION
I HAD ONLY JUST TURNED TWENTY-ONE AND HAD A VERY BOYISH APPEARANCE
THE METHOD OF WORKING AT MENLO PARK HAS ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED IN THESE PAGES BY THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED
TAKE SAY 25 LBS
I SAVED A LITTLE OF IT AND FOUND IT WAS A TERRIFIC EXPLOSIVE
THE PRINCIPAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT INFLUENCED EDISON IN MAKING THIS RADICAL INNOVATION MAY BE BRIEFLY STATED AS FOLLOWS
THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE GOLD STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY ELISHA W
THESE TWO WHEELS ARE MOUNTED RIGIDLY ON A SLEEVE CARRIED BY THE WHEEL-SHAFT
NO COPIES OF PAUL PRY CAN NOW BE FOUND BUT IT IS KNOWN THAT ITS STYLE WAS DISTINCTLY PERSONAL THAT GOSSIP WAS ITS SPECIALTY AND THAT NO SMALL OFFENCE WAS GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE WHOSE PECULIARITIES OR PECCADILLOES WERE DISCUSSED IN A FRANK AND BREEZY STYLE BY THE TWO BOYS
AND ALTHOUGH ONE CANNOT ESTIMATE IN DEFINITE FIGURES THE EXTENT OF EDISON'S INFLUENCE IN THE ENORMOUS INCREASE OF COPPER PRODUCTION IT IS TO BE REMEMBERED THAT HIS BASIC INVENTIONS CONSTITUTE A MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE DEMAND FOR THE METAL
THOUSANDS OF PERSONS THUS CAME--BANKERS BROKERS LAWYERS EDITORS AND REPORTERS PROMINENT BUSINESS MEN ELECTRICIANS INSURANCE EXPERTS UNDER WHOSE SEARCHING AND INTELLIGENT INQUIRIES THE FACTS WERE ELICITED AND GENERAL ADMIRATION WAS SOON WON FOR THE SYSTEM WHICH IN ADVANCE HAD SOLVED SO MANY NEW PROBLEMS
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
21 1898 703,774 REPRODUCER FOR PHONOGRAPHS MARCH 21 1898 626,460 FILAMENT FOR INCANDESCENT LAMPS AND MANUFACTURING SAME MARCH 29,1898 648,933 DRYER
BUT THAT REDUCTION OF ONE-HALF IN DIAMETER INCREASED THE RESISTANCE OF THE BURNER FOURFOLD AND REDUCED ITS RADIATING SURFACE TWOFOLD AND THUS INCREASED EIGHTFOLD ITS RATIO OF RESISTANCE TO RADIATING SURFACE
THUS YOU HAVE THREE SEPARATE COATINGS AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AN AIR-HOLE IN ONE SHOULD MATCH THE OTHER TO A MAN LESS THOROUGH AND EMPIRICAL IN METHOD THAN EDISON IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO HAVE MADE HIS PLANS CLEAR TO ASSOCIATES OR SUBORDINATES AND HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCURATE RESULTS
EDISON DEVOTED A GREAT DEAL OF HIS TIME TO THE ENGINEERING WORK IN CONNECTION WITH THE LAYING OUT OF THE FIRST INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC-LIGHTING SYSTEM IN NEW YORK
HE PURSUES METHODS IN ORE-DRESSING AT WHICH THOSE WHO ARE TRAINED IN THE USUAL PRACTICE MAY WELL STAND AGHAST
THE WHOLE PLACER WOULD NOT GIVE MORE THAN ONE AND ONE-QUARTER CENTS PER CUBIC YARD
CONSEQUENTLY THE LINE COULD NOT CLEAR ITSELF AND BECAME SURCHARGED AS IT WERE
IT IS ALSO NOTED THAT IN 1874 EDISON INVENTED A METHOD OF SIMULTANEOUS TRANSMISSION BY INDUCED CURRENTS WHICH HAS GIVEN VERY SATISFACTORY RESULTS IN EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS INTEREST IN THE DUPLEX AS A FIELD OF INVENTION DWINDLED HOWEVER AS THE QUADRUPLEX LOOMED UP FOR WHILE THE ONE DOUBLED THE CAPACITY OF A CIRCUIT THE LATTER CREATED THREE PHANTOM WIRES AND THUS QUADRUPLEXED THE WORKING CAPACITY OF ANY LINE TO WHICH IT WAS APPLIED
EDISON WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH PAPER CARBONS
THE NEW YORK MAN THEN COMMENCED TO SLUR OVER HIS WORDS RUNNING THEM TOGETHER AND STICKING THE SIGNALS
AND UPON ONE OCCASION WHEN THE ORDER WAS IN HAND FOR A LARGE QUANTITY OF STOCK TICKERS EDISON LOCKED HIS MEN IN UNTIL THE JOB HAD BEEN FINISHED OF MAKING THE MACHINE PERFECT AND ALL THE BUGS TAKEN OUT WHICH MEANT SIXTY HOURS OF UNINTERMITTED STRUGGLE WITH THE DIFFICULTIES
THIS WAS ACTUALLY DETERMINED BY TRIAL
ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE TAKE THAT PRODUCED BY THE PLAINTIFF WE ARE DRIVEN TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE PRIOR MACHINES THE PRODUCT OF THE SAME MIND WERE ONLY PROGRESSIVE STEPS FORWARD FROM UTTER DARKNESS SO TO SPEAK INTO FULL INVENTIVE SUNLIGHT WHICH MADE CLEAR TO HIM THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM IN THIS PATENTED MACHINE
AND VARIOUS METHODS OF UNDERGROUND CONDUCTORS WERE TRIED HASTENED IN MANY PLACES BY THE CHOPPING DOWN OF POLES AND WIRES AS THE RESULT OF SOME ACCIDENT THAT STIRRED THE PUBLIC INDIGNATION
THE CURRENT AS IT PASSES INTO THE PRIMARY BEING BROKEN UP INTO SHORT IMPULSES BY THE TREMENDOUSLY RAPID VIBRATIONS OF THE BUZZER INDUCES SIMILARLY RAPID WAVES OF HIGH POTENTIAL IN THE SECONDARY AND THESE IN TURN PASS TO THE ROOF AND THENCE THROUGH THE INTERVENING AIR BY INDUCTION TO THE TELEGRAPH WIRE
I DON'T THINK YOU ARE WORKING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ANOTHER DATE WHICH SHOWS HOW PROMPTLY THE WORK WAS RESUMED IS OCTOBER 14 1878 WHEN EDISON FILED AN APPLICATION FOR HIS FIRST LIGHTING PATENT
BEARING IN MIND THE FACT THAT WHEN AN IMAGE IS IMPRESSED ON THE HUMAN RETINA IT PERSISTS FOR AN APPRECIABLE PERIOD VARYING AS STATED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL AND DEPENDING ALSO UPON THE INTENSITY OF THE ILLUMINATION IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IF A NUMBER OF PICTURES OR PHOTOGRAPHS ARE SUCCESSIVELY PRESENTED TO THE EYE THEY WILL APPEAR AS A SINGLE CONTINUOUS PHOTOGRAPH PROVIDED THE PERIODS BETWEEN THEM ARE SHORT ENOUGH TO PREVENT ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS FROM BEING EFFACED BEFORE ITS SUCCESSOR IS PRESENTED
BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT EDISON'S ROUND OF TOIL AND RELAXATION IS SINGULARLY UNIFORM AND FREE FROM AGITATION AND THAT IS THE WAY HE WOULD RATHER HAVE IT
IT IS SOME GRATIFICATION FOR ME TO ANNOUNCE MY BELIEF THAT HE HAS AT LAST SOLVED THE PROBLEM HE SET HIMSELF TO SOLVE AND TO BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE TO THE SOCIETY THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAS SOLVED IT BEFORE THE EXHIBITION CLOSED IT WAS VISITED BY THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALES--NOW THE DECEASED EDWARD VII
THE PERFECTION OF ALL HIS GREAT INVENTIONS HAS BEEN SIGNALIZED BY PATIENT PERSISTENT AND INCESSANT EFFORT WHICH RECOGNIZING NOTHING SHORT OF SUCCESS HAS RESULTED IN THE ULTIMATE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HIS IDEAS
MARTIN A
AS THIS INVENTION EFFECTED A SAVING OF SEVEN-EIGHTHS OF THE COST OF THE CHIEF CONDUCTORS IN A STRAIGHT MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM THE MAINS FOR THE FIRST DISTRICT WERE REFIGURED AND ENORMOUS NEW MAPS WERE MADE WHICH BECAME THE FINAL BASIS OF ACTUAL INSTALLATION AS THEY WERE SUBSEQUENTLY ENLARGED BY THE ADDITION OF EVERY PROPOSED JUNCTION-BOX BRIDGE SAFETY-CATCH BOX AND STREET-INTERSECTION BOX IN THE WHOLE AREA
THAT DIFFERENCE CONSISTING IN GENERATING THE NECESSARY AMOUNT OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY WITH COMPARATIVELY HIGH ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE AND COMPARATIVELY LOW CURRENT INSTEAD OF CONTRARIWISE
THE OUTBREAK OF THE CIVIL WAR GAVE A GREAT STIMULUS TO THE DEMAND FOR ALL NEWSPAPERS NOTICING WHICH HE BECAME AMBITIOUS TO PUBLISH A LOCAL JOURNAL OF HIS OWN DEVOTED TO THE NEWS OF THAT SECTION OF THE GRAND TRUNK ROAD

HIS NATURE REVOLTED AT SUCH AN IMMENSE LOSS OF POWER ESPECIALLY AS HE PROPOSED THE CRUSHING OF VAST QUANTITIES OF ORE
TO THIS END THE READER'S ATTENTION IS CALLED TO A FEW EXTRACTS FROM A DECISION OF JUDGE BROWN IN TWO SUITS BROUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS BY THE AMERICAN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY AGAINST THE NATIONAL TELEPHONE MANUFACTURING COMPANY ET AL AND CENTURY TELEPHONE COMPANY ET AL REPORTED IN FEDERAL REPORTER 109 PAGE 976 ET SEQ
MY METHODS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOLLOWED BY LUTHER BURBANK
A SMALL PRINTING-PRESS THAT HAD BEEN USED FOR HOTEL BILLS OF FARE WAS PICKED UP IN DETROIT AND TYPE WAS ALSO BOUGHT SOME OF IT BEING PLACED ON THE TRAIN SO THAT COMPOSITION COULD GO ON IN SPELLS OF LEISURE
EDISON HAS ALWAYS HAD AN AMUSED ADMIRATION FOR BERGMANN AND HIS SOCIAL SIDE IS OFTEN MADE EVIDENT BY HIS LOVE OF TELLING STORIES ABOUT THOSE DAYS OF STRUGGLE
FLACK FORMERLY MASTER MECHANIC AT THE LAMP FACTORY MAY BE QUOTED
219,393 WHICH HAD A RING ARMATURE

ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE
ON BLACK FRIDAY THEY PURCHASED ANOTHER $28,000,000 AT 160 AND STILL THE PRICE WENT UP
DOES MR EDISON OR ANY ONE FOR HIM MEAN TO SAY THAT R/N ENABLES HIM TO OBTAIN NE AND THAT C IS NOT = E R/N + R
IN NEW YORK THERE WAS A CEASELESS DEMAND FOR IT AND WITH THE AID OF HILBOURNE L
AND THAT THE MERE PROSAIC FACTS OF HIS ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENT OUTRUN THE WILDEST FLIGHTS OF IRRELEVANT JOURNALISTIC IMAGINATION
IN YOUTHFUL YEARS AS ALREADY DESCRIBED IN THIS BOOK HE BECAME ARDENTLY INTERESTED IN CHEMISTRY AND EVEN AT THE EARLY AGE OF TWELVE FELT THE NECESSITY FOR A SPECIAL NOOK OF HIS OWN WHERE HE COULD SATISFY HIS UNCONVINCED MIND OF THE CORRECTNESS OR INACCURACY OF STATEMENTS AND EXPERIMENTS CONTAINED IN THE FEW TECHNICAL BOOKS THEN AT HIS COMMAND
MY COPY LOOKED FINE IF VIEWED AS A WHOLE AS I COULD WRITE A PERFECTLY STRAIGHT LINE ACROSS THE WIDE SHEET WHICH WAS NOT RULED
ITS ARMATURE MOVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ELECTRICAL IMPULSES OR SIGNALS TRANSMITTED FROM A DISTANCE AND IN SO RESPONDING OPERATES MECHANICALLY TO ALTERNATELY CLOSE AND OPEN A SEPARATE LOCAL CIRCUIT IN WHICH THERE IS A SOUNDER AND A POWERFUL BATTERY
THE SYNDICATE WAS APPALLED AT THIS REPORT AND IN THIS EXTREMITY GENERAL PALMER THOUGHT OF THE MAN WHO HAD IMPRESSED HIM AS KNOWING IT ALL BY THE TELLING OF TELEGRAPHIC TALES AS A MEANS OF WHILING AWAY LONESOME HOURS ON THE PLAINS OF COLORADO WHERE THEY WERE ASSOCIATED IN RAILROAD-BUILDING
21 1888 434,587 THERMO ELECTRIC BATTERY
THE MOTOR WAS LOCATED IN THE FRONT PART OF THE LOCOMOTIVE ON ITS SIDE WITH THE ARMATURE SHAFT ACROSS THE FRAMES OR PARALLEL WITH THE DRIVING AXLES
LAST TO BE MENTIONED BUT THE FIRST IN ORDER AS ONE LEAVES THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS LEADING UP TO THIS FLOOR IS NO
HENCE WE QUOTE THE FOLLOWING NOTES HE MADE NOVEMBER 15 1878 IN ONE OF THE LABORATORY NOTE-BOOKS
INDEED IT WAS SO FAR FROM BEING OBVIOUS THAT FOR SOME TIME AFTER HE HAD COMPLETED PRACTICAL LAMPS AND WAS ACTUALLY LIGHTING THEM UP TWENTY-FOUR HOURS A DAY SUCH A DEVICE AND SUCH A RESULT WERE DECLARED BY THESE SAME EXPERTS TO BE AN UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY
IN THE MANUFACTURE OF ABOUT $50,000,000 WORTH OF DYNAMOS AND MOTORS ANNUALLY FOR CENTRAL-STATION EQUIPMENT ISOLATED PLANTS ELECTRIC RAILWAYS AND OTHER PURPOSES THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE COUNTRY EMPLOY AN AVERAGE OF NOT LESS THAN 30,000 PEOPLE WHOSE YEARLY PAY-ROLL AMOUNTS TO NO LESS A SUM THAN $20,000,000
THERE HAD BEEN SOME KIND OF CONVENTION IN VIRGINIA IN WHICH JOHN MINOR BOTTS WAS THE LEADING FIGURE
HIS CONCEPTION OF THE CONCENTRATING PROBLEM WAS BROAD AND EMBRACED AN ENTIRE SYSTEM OF WHICH A PRINCIPAL ITEM WAS THE CONTINUOUS TRANSFER OF ENORMOUS QUANTITIES OF MATERIAL FROM PLACE TO PLACE AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE COST
AFTER TRYING FOR A WEEK I GAVE IT UP AND RETURNED TO NEW YORK WITH BUT A FEW CENTS IN MY POCKET THUS HE WHO HAS NEVER SPECULATED IN A STOCK IN HIS LIFE WAS DESTINED TO MAKE THE BEGINNINGS OF HIS OWN FORTUNE BY PROVIDING FOR OTHERS THE APPARATUS THAT SHOULD BRING TO THE EYE ALL OVER A GREAT CITY THE MOMENTARY FLUCTUATIONS OF STOCKS AND BONDS
THESE ARE BUT TYPICAL OF HUNDREDS OF MEN WHO COULD BE NAMED WHO HAVE RISEN FROM WORK AT THE KEY TO BECOME RECOGNIZED LEADERS IN DIFFERING SPHERES OF ACTIVITY
IT WILL BE NOTED THAT THIS WAS MERELY AN ELABORATED FORM OF THE FIRST MODEL AND EMBODIED SEVERAL MECHANICAL MODIFICATIONS AMONG WHICH WAS THE EMPLOYMENT OF ONLY ONE DIAPHRAGM FOR RECORDING AND REPRODUCING
WHEN I TOOK THE POSITION THERE WAS A GREAT SHORTAGE OF OPERATORS
MAKE ME AN OFFER THEN HE SAID
AND WHEN THE CAR WAS RECEIVED I MADE INQUIRY AS TO WHETHER ANY REPAIR PARTS WERE CARRIED BY ANY OF THE VARIOUS GARAGES IN EASTON PENNSYLVANIA NEAR OUR CEMENT WORKS
LEAVING EDISON AND THE OTHERS BUSILY WORKING HE WENT OUT AND RETURNED QUIETLY IN SLIPPERED FEET WITH HIS NIGHTGOWN ON THE HANDLE OF A FEATHER DUSTER STUCK DOWN HIS BACK WITH THE FEATHERS WAVING OVER HIS HEAD AND HIS FACE MARKED
BUT AMONG FAR-SIGHTED INVENTORS THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE RUSH TO THE GOLD FIELDS BELL'S FIRST APPARATUS WAS POOR THE RESULTS BEING DESCRIBED BY HIMSELF AS UNSATISFACTORY AND DISCOURAGING WHICH WAS ALMOST AS TRUE OF THE DEVICES HE EXHIBITED AT THE PHILADELPHIA CENTENNIAL
THE CLEVELAND REPORT WIRE WAS IN SPECIAL NEED AND EDISON ALMOST ALONE IN THE OFFICE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO IT ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT AND UNTIL 3 O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE WAS RELIEVED
EDISON SAYS
EDISON SAYS
EDISON SAYS
SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC-LIGHT CURRENT WAS MADE PRACTICABLE
AT THE PRESENT TIME 1910 THE EDISON STORAGE-BATTERY ENTERPRISE IS IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF GROWTH AND ITS STATUS MAY BE COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE ELECTRIC-LIGHT SYSTEM ABOUT THE YEAR 1881
IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE AEROPHONE THE SAME KIND OF TYMPANUM IS USED AS IN THE PHONOGRAPH BUT THE IMITATION OF THE HUMAN VOICE OR THE TRANSMISSION OF SOUND IS EFFECTED BY THE QUICK OPENING AND CLOSING OF VALVES PLACED WITHIN A STEAM-WHISTLE OR AN ORGAN-PIPE
BUT HE WAS DETERMINED TO LIFT HIMSELF INTO THE CLASS OF FIRST-CLASS OPERATORS AND HAD KEPT UP THE PRACTICE OF GOING TO THE OFFICE AT NIGHT TO COPY PRESS ACTING WILLINGLY AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY OPERATOR WHO WANTED TO GET OFF FOR A FEW HOURS--WHICH OFTEN MEANT ALL NIGHT
NICODEMUS PAID ME $27 FOR THIS LAST SALE AND THREW THE WHOLE OUT OF THE DOOR IN THE REAR OF THE CAR
13 1871 133,841 TYPEWRITING MACHINE
THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE VARIOUS PARTIES WERE THEN SET UP IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE LITTLE TOWN AND GOT READY FOR THE ECLIPSE WHICH WAS TO OCCUR IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS
ON ACCOUNT OF BOTH RAILS BEING USED FOR CIRCUITS THE DRIVING-WHEELS HAD TO BE SPLIT CIRCUMFERENTIALLY AND COMPLETELY INSULATED FROM THE AXLES
IF FURTHER PROOF WERE DESIRED IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO POINT TO THE FACT THAT AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF MOST STRENUOUS AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN THE ART BY THE KEENEST INTELLECTS OF THE WORLD EVERY INCANDESCENT LAMP THAT HAS EVER SINCE BEEN MADE INCLUDING THOSE OF MODERN DAYS IS STILL DEPENDENT UPON THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE ESSENTIALS DISCLOSED IN THE ABOVE-NAMED PATENT--NAMELY A FILAMENT OF HIGH RESISTANCE ENCLOSED IN A SEALED GLASS GLOBE EXHAUSTED OF AIR WITH CONDUCTING WIRES PASSING THROUGH THE GLASS
IN LIKE MANNER THE SIMPLE PHONAUTOGRAPH OF LEON SCOTT INVENTED ABOUT 1858 RECORDS ON A REVOLVING CYLINDER OF BLACKENED PAPER THE SOUND VIBRATIONS TRANSMITTED THROUGH A MEMBRANE TO WHICH A TINY STYLUS IS ATTACHED
I PUT THE CURVES IN
THESE FIGURES CAN BE VERIFIED AT THE OFFICE OF THE BOARD OF UNDERWRITERS WHERE CERTIFICATES WITH FULL DETAILS PERMITTING THE USE OF OUR LIGHT ARE FILED BY THEIR OWN INSPECTOR
BUT UNLIKE THE LARGER ONES WERE POSITIVELY DRIVEN REDUCING THE ROCK TO PIECES OF ABOUT ONE-HALF-INCH SIZE OR SMALLER
JUNE 10 1872 131,335 PRINTING TELEGRAPHS
I WANTED TO INTEREST THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY IN IT WITH A VIEW OF SELLING IT BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL UNTIL I MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE CHIEF ELECTRICIAN OF THE COMPANY SO THAT HE COULD BE KNOWN AS A JOINT INVENTOR AND RECEIVE A PORTION OF THE MONEY
BUT THE INTENSITY OF THE VIBRATIONS DIMINISHES VERY RAPIDLY WITH THE DISTANCE
DID YOU GET IT THIS WAS SURELY A SUMMING OF A YEAR'S EXPLORATION NOT LESS LACONIC THAN CAESAR'S REVIEW OF HIS GALLIC CAMPAIGN
THESE EXPERIMENTS HAD EXTENDED OVER MANY MONTHS OF CONSTANT WORK BY DAY AND NIGHT BUT THERE WAS NO BREAKDOWN OF EDISON'S FAITH IN ULTIMATE SUCCESS--NO DIMINUTION OF HIS SANGUINE AND CONFIDENT EXPECTATIONS
THE BATTERY IS SHOWN AT F
THESE FIGURES RELATE ONLY TO TELEPHONE SYSTEMS AND DO NOT INCLUDE ANY DETAILS REGARDING THE GREAT MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENTS ENGAGED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF TELEPHONE APPARATUS OF WHICH THERE IS A PRODUCTION AMOUNTING TO AT LEAST $15,000,000 PER ANNUM
ALL OF THIS WAS DONE BY THE COURAGE CAPITAL AND INVINCIBLE ENERGY AND GENIUS OF THE GREAT INVENTOR
I SHOULD NOT TAKE TOO YOUNG A MAN FOR THIS SAY A MAN FROM TWENTY-THREE TO THIRTY YEARS OLD BRIGHT AND BUSINESSLIKE
SUNBURY HOWEVER WAS A MUCH SMALLER INSTALLATION EMPLOYED OVERHEAD CONDUCTORS AND HENCE WAS THE FIRST TO CROSS THE TAPE IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE-POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
THEY THEN NOTIFIED THE WAR DEPARTMENT THAT THEY COULD NOT GET LOUISVILLE
A CONCRETE EXAMPLE IS PRESENTED IN THE ILLUSTRATION BELOW WHICH SHOWS A PIECE OF TAPE WITH PERFORATIONS REPRESENTING THE WORD SAME THE PHILOSOPHY OF THIS WILL BE AT ONCE PERCEIVED WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED THAT THE TWO LITTLE WHEELS RUNNING UPON THE DRUM OF THE TRANSMITTING INSTRUMENT WERE SITUATED SIDE BY SIDE CORRESPONDING IN DISTANCE TO THE TWO ROWS OF HOLES
14 1882 274,290 SYSTEM OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION
30 1886 454,262 INCANDESCENT LAMP FILAMENTS
THIS THING IS A FRAUD AND THUS HE SAVED HIS MONEY ALTHOUGH OTHERS NOT SO SHREWDLY ADVISED WERE EASILY PERSUADED TO INVEST BY SUCH A DEMONSTRATION
9 1882 268,206 INCANDESCING ELECTRIC LAMP OCT
EDISON WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE NUMEROUS BUT IMPRACTICABLE AND COMMERCIALLY UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY MADE BY OTHER INVENTORS AND INVESTIGATORS TO PRODUCE ELECTRIC LIGHT BY INCANDESCENCE AND AT THE TIME THAT HE BEGAN HIS EXPERIMENTS IN 1877 ALMOST THE WHOLE SCIENTIFIC WORLD HAD PRONOUNCED SUCH AN IDEA AS IMPOSSIBLE OF FULFILMENT
AS WILL BE SEEN X HAS NO CONNECTION WITH ANYTHING
HE CONTRIVED SO MANY LITTLE TOOLS TO CHEAPEN THE WORK THAT HE MADE LOTS OF MONEY
FINALLY I OPENED THE PEDESTAL--A STOREHOUSE FOR TOOLS ETC
NICKEL HYDRATE FOR THE POSITIVE AND IRON OXIDE FOR THE NEGATIVE PLATE
IT DESERVES AWARD AS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP IN LAND TELEGRAPHY THE ATTITUDE THUS DISCLOSED TOWARD MR EDISON'S WORK WAS NEVER CHANGED EXCEPT THAT ADMIRATION GREW AS FRESH INVENTIONS WERE BROUGHT FORWARD
ON SEPTEMBER 4 AND AT THE CLOSE OF 1882 IT WAS LIGHTING 225 HOUSES WIRED FOR ABOUT 5000 LAMPS
HE FOLLOWED HIS USUAL CUSTOM OF SPENDING SUNDAY AT HOME IN ORANGE
THE SOLUTION CONSISTED NOT ONLY IN THAT BUT IN THE ENORMOUS MASS OF PATIENTLY WORKED-OUT DETAILS--THE MANUFACTURE OF THE FILAMENTS THEIR UNIFORM CARBONIZATION MAKING THE GLOBES PRODUCING A PERFECT VACUUM AND COUNTLESS OTHER FACTORS THE OMISSION OF ANY ONE OF WHICH WOULD PROBABLY HAVE RESULTED EVENTUALLY IN FAILURE

SOME THINGS IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPRODUCE IN ANY PICTURE OF THE ART AND THE TIMES
AND THAT GREAT REDUCTION IN THE SIZE AND COST OF CONDUCTORS INVOLVED ALSO A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE ELECTRIC ENERGY EMPLOYED IN THE SYSTEM
PALMER AND SOME NEW YORK ASSOCIATES HAD TAKEN UP THE LITTLE AUTOMATIC SYSTEM AND HAD EXPENDED QUITE A SUM IN ITS DEVELOPMENT WHEN THINKING THEY HAD REDUCED IT TO PRACTICE THEY GOT TOM SCOTT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD TO SEND HIS SUPERINTENDENT OF TELEGRAPH OVER TO LOOK INTO AND REPORT UPON IT
REFERENCE HEREIN HAS BEEN MADE TO THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE TWO GREAT ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES WISHED TO CONFER A DEGREE UPON HIM BUT THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO LEAVE HIS WORK FOR THE BRIEF TIME NECESSARY TO ACCEPT THE HONOR
THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO CONCERNS RESULTED IN CONSOLIDATION DOCTOR LAWS'S ENTERPRISE BEING ABSORBED BY THE GOLD STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY WHILE THE LAWS STOCK PRINTER WAS RELEGATED TO THE SCRAP-HEAP AND THE MUSEUM
THE TEN ACRES OF THE RESERVATION OFFERED AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR TRUCK-FARMING AND THE VERSATILE HEAD OF THE FAMILY COULD NOT AVOID TRYING HIS LUCK IN THIS BRANCH OF WORK
WHAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS NOW IS THE PRACTICAL SKILLED ENGINEER WHO IS CAPABLE OF DOING EVERYTHING
WHILE THIS CONTROVERSY RAGED IN THE SCIENTIFIC PAPERS AND CRITICISM AND CONFUSION SEEMED AT ITS HEIGHT EDISON AND UPTON DISCUSSED THIS QUESTION VERY THOROUGHLY AND EDISON DECLARED HE DID NOT INTEND TO BUILD UP A SYSTEM OF DISTRIBUTION IN WHICH THE EXTERNAL RESISTANCE WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE INTERNAL RESISTANCE
I WALKED INTO THE OFFICE MARKED EDITORIAL AND TOLD A YOUNG MAN THAT I WANTED TO SEE THE EDITOR ON IMPORTANT BUSINESS--IMPORTANT TO ME ANYWAY I WAS TAKEN INTO AN OFFICE WHERE THERE WERE TWO MEN AND I STATED WHAT I HAD DONE ABOUT TELEGRAPHING AND THAT I WANTED A THOUSAND PAPERS BUT ONLY HAD MONEY FOR THREE HUNDRED AND I WANTED CREDIT
IF BOTH TRANSMITTERS BE CLOSED SIMULTANEOUSLY BOTH BATTERIES WILL BE PLACED TO THE LINE WHICH WOULD PRACTICALLY RESULT IN DOUBLING THE CURRENT IN EACH OF THE MAIN-LINE COILS IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH BOTH RELAYS ARE ENERGIZED AND THEIR ARMATURES ATTRACTED THROUGH THE OPERATION OF THE KEYS AT THE DISTANT ENDS
I CAN ALWAYS HIRE SOME MATHEMATICIANS BUT THEY CAN'T HIRE ME HIS FATHER BY-THE-WAY ALWAYS ENCOURAGED THESE LITERARY TASTES AND PAID HIM A SMALL SUM FOR EACH NEW BOOK MASTERED
AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN HE COULD NOT USE CARBON SUCCESSFULLY IN HIS EARLIER EXPERIMENTS FOR THE STRIPS OF CARBON HE THEN EMPLOYED ALTHOUGH THEY WERE MUCH LARGER THAN FILAMENTS WOULD NOT STAND BUT WERE CONSUMED IN A FEW MINUTES UNDER THE IMPERFECT CONDITIONS THEN AT HIS COMMAND
THE FIRST MOTION-PICTURE STUDIO WAS DUBBED BY THE STAFF THE BLACK MARIA IT WAS AN UNPRETENTIOUS OBLONG WOODEN STRUCTURE ERECTED IN THE LABORATORY YARD AND HAD A MOVABLE ROOF IN THE CENTRAL PART
THE PATH OF GRAY TO THE TELEPHONE WAS A NATURAL ONE
HE WAS A MAN OF GREAT INTELLIGENCE AND EDUCATION
I GOT MY APPARATUS DOWN AND SET UP AND THEN TO GET A PRELIMINARY IDEA OF WHAT THE DISTORTION OF THE SIGNAL WOULD BE I SENT A SINGLE DOT WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED UPON MY AUTOMATIC PAPER BY A MARK ABOUT ONE-THIRTY-SECOND OF AN INCH LONG
HIS NEXT DEVELOPMENT WAS THE RADICAL ADVANCEMENT OF THE STATE OF THE ART TO THE FEEDER SYSTEM COVERED BY THE PATENT NOW UNDER DISCUSSION
IT HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED AT THE END OF A PREVIOUS CHAPTER THAT ON CLOSING THE MAGNETIC IRON-ORE CONCENTRATING PLANT AT EDISON NEW JERSEY HE RESOLVED TO WORK ON A NEW TYPE OF STORAGE BATTERY
WHEN THE LAMP BECAME A THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED ARTICLE IT WAS NOT A DIFFICULT MATTER TO COPY IT ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE WERE EMPLOYEES TO BE HIRED AWAY AT INCREASED PAY AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE UTILIZED BY THE MORE UNSCRUPULOUS OF THESE NEW COMPETITORS
MR GOULD WAS UP-TOWN IN THE ERIE OFFICES IN THE GRAND OPERA HOUSE
THE STOCK WAS THEN SELLING AT ABOUT 25 AND IN THE LATER CONSOLIDATION WITH THE WESTERN UNION WENT IN AT ABOUT 60
I SAID
I SAID
I SAID
EDISON'S CLAIMS WERE STRENUOUSLY AND STUBBORNLY CONTESTED THROUGHOUT A SERIES OF INTENSE LEGAL CONFLICTS THAT RAGED IN THE COURTS FOR A GREAT MANY YEARS
THE FOREIGNER DID NOT GO TO GET THE CYANIDE BUT GAVE UP HIS JOB
THE SHEET IS CUT INTO TINY SQUARES EACH ABOUT ONE-SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH AND THESE SQUARES ARE PUT INTO A BATH WHERE THE COPPER IS DISSOLVED OUT
MOREOVER THESE FIGURES DEAL ONLY WITH THE UNITED STATES AND TAKE NO ACCOUNT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANY OF THE EDISON INVENTIONS IN EUROPE OR OF THEIR ADOPTION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AT LARGE
IN THE SECOND YEAR WE PUT THE STOCK EXCHANGE ON THE CIRCUITS OF THE STATION BUT WERE VERY FEARFUL THAT THERE WOULD BE A COMBINATION OF HEAVY DEMAND AND A DARK DAY AND THAT THERE WOULD BE AN OVERLOADED STATION
I MAY ADD FROM MY OWN PERSONAL OBSERVATION THAT IN MR EDISON'S CLOTHES THERE IS NO EVIDENCE BUT THAT EVERY NEW SUIT THAT HE HAS WORN IN THAT TIME LOOKS AS IF HE HAD BEEN SPECIALLY MEASURED FOR IT WHICH SHOWS HOW VERY LITTLE HE HAS CHANGED PHYSICALLY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS EDISON HAS NEVER HAD ANY TASTE FOR AMUSEMENTS ALTHOUGH HE WILL INDULGE IN THE GAME OF PARCHESI AND HAS A BILLIARD-TABLE IN HIS HOUSE
HE WAS THE FIRST CAPITALIST TO BACK INDIVIDUALLY EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS IN ELECTRIC RAILWAYS IN SPEAKING OF HIS RELATIONSHIPS WITH MR VILLARD AT THIS TIME EDISON SAYS
AND THE JUDGE IS SUPPOSED TO EXTRACT SOME ESSENCE OF JUSTICE FROM THIS MASS OF CONFLICTING BLIND AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS
BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE OFFICE IN THE AFTERNOON TO REPORT FOR DUTY I WAS DISCHARGED WITH OUT EXPLANATION
THE MAIN PIPE WHICH WAS FULL OF MERCURY WAS ABOUT SEVEN AND ONE-HALF FEET FROM THE FLOOR
MR EDISON SENT THE LACONIC REPLY
THE ADAPTATION OF THE PRINCIPLES THUS ELUCIDATED AND THE SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRESENT WONDERFUL ART BY MARCONI BRANLY LODGE SLABY AND OTHERS ARE NOW TOO WELL KNOWN TO CALL FOR FURTHER REMARK AT THIS PLACE
HIS APPEARANCE AS A WHOLE WAS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD CALL SLOVENLY IT IS BEST EXPRESSED BY THE WORD CARELESS MR INSULL SUPPLEMENTS THIS PEN-PICTURE BY ANOTHER BEARING UPON THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF THE MOMENT
THERE IS VERY LITTLE THAT IS SHOWY FROM THE POPULAR POINT OF VIEW IN THE GIGANTIC WORK WHICH MR EDISON HAS DONE DURING THESE YEARS BUT TO THOSE WHO ARE CAPABLE OF GRASPING THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED MR EDISON APPEARS IN THE NEW LIGHT OF A BRILLIANT CONSTRUCTING ENGINEER GRAPPLING WITH TECHNICAL AND COMMERCIAL PROBLEMS OF THE HIGHEST ORDER
I HAD TWO GERMANS WHO WERE TESTING THERE AND BOTH OF THEM DIED OF DIPHTHERIA CAUGHT IN THE CELLAR WHICH WAS COLD AND DAMP
EDISON SAYS THAT WHILE APPARENTLY A QUIET MAN IN BEARING ELLSWORTH AFTER THE EXCITEMENT OF FIGHTING FOUND THE TAMENESS OF A TELEGRAPH OFFICE OBNOXIOUS AND THAT HE BECAME A BAD GUN MAN IN THE PANHANDLE OF TEXAS WHERE HE WAS KILLED
I KEPT THIS POSITION MADE MANY IMPROVEMENTS DEVISED SEVERAL STOCK TICKERS UNTIL THE GOLD STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY CONSOLIDATED WITH THE GOLD INDICATOR COMPANY CERTAINLY FEW CHANGES IN FORTUNE HAVE BEEN MORE SUDDEN AND DRAMATIC IN ANY NOTABLE CAREER THAN THIS WHICH THUS PLACED AN ILL-CLAD UNKEMPT HALF-STARVED EAGER LAD IN A POSITION OF SUCH RESPONSIBILITY IN DAYS WHEN THE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE OF GOLD AT EVERY INSTANT MEANT FORTUNE OR RUIN TO THOUSANDS
UNFORTUNATELY A SUDDEN CHANGE CAME FRAUGHT WITH DISASTER
IT WAS ONLY AFTER I TOLD HIM I WAS TIRED AND WOULD SEE HIM IN THE MORNING THAT HE LEFT
IF HOWEVER THE MAGNET IS ENERGIZED FROM A SOURCE OF CURRENT THE MAGNETIC PARTICLES IN THE FALLING STREAM ARE ATTRACTED BY AND MOVE TOWARD THE MAGNET WHICH IS SO PLACED WITH RELATION TO THE FALLING MATERIAL THAT THE MAGNETIC PARTICLES CANNOT BE ATTRACTED ENTIRELY TO THE MAGNET BEFORE GRAVITY HAS CARRIED THEM PAST
NO SOONER HAD HE ACCOMPLISHED THE TASK AND SHOWN CONCRETE RESULTS TO THE WORLD THAN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE ANOMALOUS POSITION OF BEING AT ONCE SURROUNDED BY THE CONDITIONS WHICH INEVITABLY CONFRONT EVERY INVENTOR
WHAT IS IT HE SAID
THUS AN EXTENDED CONTACT WAS MADE WHICH BY TRANSMITTING A LONG IMPULSE RESULTED IN THE MARKING OF A DASH UPON THE RECEIVING TAPE
THERE WAS A BASKET OF CHAMPAGNE
AND THE OTHER COMPOSED OF A THIN PLATE OR PENCIL OF CARBON ENCLOSED IN A TORRICELLIAN VACUUM
HIS COUNSELS PREVAILED AND THE WISDOM OF THE POLICY ADOPTED WAS SEEN IN THE SWIFT ESTABLISHMENT OF EDISON COMPANIES IN CENTRES OF POPULATION BOTH GREAT AND SMALL WHOSE BUSINESS HAS EVER BEEN A CONSTANT AND GROWING SOURCE OF INCOME FOR THE PARENT MANUFACTURING INTERESTS
AT 212 IT CAN BE PUT ON RODS AND THERE IS NO BUBBLE
THEY SAID THEY WERE SORRY'--THAT IS WALL STREET SORRY'--AND REFUSED TO PAY IT
HAD COME IN FULL OF SODA-WATER AND INVENTED THE RUIN BEFORE HIM
1 WHICH IS REFERRED TO IN THE NARRATIVE AS HAVING BEEN EXHIBITED AT THE PARIS INTERNATIONAL ELECTRICAL EXPOSITION WHERE IT WAS REGARDED AS THE WONDER OF THE ELECTRICAL WORLD
AND THE WORLD WAS CAPTIVATED WITH THE IDEA
THERE WAS NO REASON WHY EDISON COULD NOT HAVE CONTINUED THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY AFTER HE HAD HELPED TO SHOW ITS PRACTICABILITY IN 1880 1881 AND 1882 JUST AS HE HAD COMPLETED HIS LIGHTING SYSTEM HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT HIS FINANCIAL ALLIES OF THE PERIOD LACKED FAITH IN THE POSSIBILITIES OF ELECTRIC RAILROADS AND THEREFORE DECLINED TO FURNISH THE MONEY NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CARRYING ON THE WORK
THIS IS CONFIRMED AS ONE ENTERS THE DOOR AND FINDS THAT THE ENTIRE BUILDING IS DEVOTED TO CHEMISTRY
ONE DAY AT AN AUCTION-ROOM HE SECURED A STACK OF TWENTY UNBOUND VOLUMES OF THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW FOR TWO DOLLARS

ONE MAN WHO HAD SEEN IT CAME TO ME NEXT DAY AND WANTED ME TO PUT IN APPARATUS FOR HIM AT A PLACE WHERE THEY SOLD HORSES
FOR HIS QUADRUPLEX SYSTEM MR EDISON UTILIZED THIS FACT IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RHEOSTAT OR RESISTANCE BOX
BEFORE THIS HOWEVER EDISON HAD ATTAINED THESE RESULTS BY PIONEER WORK FOUNDED ON HIS ORIGINAL REASONING AND UTILIZED THEM IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF HIS DYNAMO THUS REVOLUTIONIZING THE ART OF BUILDING SUCH MACHINES
DURING THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR OF 1898 EDISON SUGGESTED TO THE NAVY DEPARTMENT THE ADOPTION OF A COMPOUND OF CALCIUM CARBIDE AND CALCIUM PHOSPHITE WHICH WHEN PLACED IN A SHELL AND FIRED FROM A GUN WOULD EXPLODE AS SOON AS IT STRUCK WATER AND IGNITE PRODUCING A BLAZE THAT WOULD CONTINUE SEVERAL MINUTES AND MAKE THE SHIPS OF THE ENEMY VISIBLE FOR FOUR OR FIVE MILES AT SEA
MEANTIME THE WAX CANDLE AND THE ARGAND OIL LAMP HELD THEIR OWN BRAVELY
DOWN AT MENLO PARK A MAN CAME IN ONE DAY AND WANTED A JOB

THIS CURIOUS PARTNERSHIP WAS MAINTAINED FOR SOME TIME EVEN WHEN THE BELL TELEPHONE OFFICES WERE REMOVED TO READE STREET NEW YORK WHITHER THE PHONOGRAPH WENT ALSO
I STARTED FOR THE OIL-ROOM WHEN ABOUT ENTERING I SAW A SMALL FUNNEL LYING ON THE FLOOR
A ROMANCE OF SCIENCE THE NARRATIVE GIVEN ELSEWHERE IN THE EVENING SUN OF THE WANDERINGS OF EDISON'S MISSIONARY OF SCIENCE MR FRANK MCGOWAN FURNISHES A NEW PROOF THAT THE ROMANCES OF REAL LIFE SURPASS ANY THAT THE IMAGINATION CAN FRAME
THIS PROCEDURE WAS FRUITFUL IN TWO PRINCIPAL RESULTS--THE EDUCATION OF THE WHOLE EXECUTIVE FORCE IN THE TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE SYSTEM
IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT IN THE COURSE OF A CONVERSATION WITH MR R
IT IS RARELY HOWEVER THAT A MAN WILL START OUT DELIBERATELY AS EDISON DID TO EVOLVE A RADICALLY NEW TYPE OF SUCH AN INTRICATE DEVICE AS THE STORAGE BATTERY WITH ONLY A MEAGRE CLEW AND A VAGUE STARTING-POINT
THE LABORATORY WITNESSED HIGH TIMES THAT NIGHT FOR ALL WERE IN THE BEST OF HUMOR AND MANY A BOTTLE WAS DRAINED IN TOASTING THE HEALTH OF EDISON AND THE ALDERMEN THIS WAS ONE OF THE EXTREMELY RARE OCCASIONS ON WHICH EDISON HAS ADDRESSED AN AUDIENCE
MARCH 7 1873 141,774 CHEMICAL TELEGRAPHS
OF THE STOCK OF THE LOCAL TELEPHONE SYSTEMS OF NEW YORK AND CHICAGO
REDUCED TO ITS BAREST CRUDEST TERMS THE PROPOSITION OF MAGNETIC SEPARATION IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF
THUS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT A THREE-WIRE SYSTEM CONSIDERED AS A WHOLE IS ELASTIC IN THAT IT MAY OPERATE AS ONE WHEN IN BALANCE AND AS TWO WHEN UNBALANCED BUT IN EITHER EVENT GIVING INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF EACH UNIT
I DID NOT GO ON THE STREET BY DAYLIGHT FOR TWO WEEKS AS THE APPEARANCE OF MY FACE WAS DREADFUL
MARCH 29,1905 854,200 MAKING STORAGE BATTERY ELECTRODES
EDISON WHO BECAME UNDER THE AGREEMENT THE ELECTRICIAN OF THE ATLANTIC PACIFIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY HAS TESTIFIED TO THE UNFRIENDLY ATTITUDE ASSUMED TOWARD HIM BY GENERAL ECKERT AS PRESIDENT
WHILE ON THE FLOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE TABLE ARE SPECIMENS OF THE FULL-SIZE MOLDS IN WHICH THE HOUSE WILL BE CAST
THIS IN ITSELF IS A BUSINESS OF NO SMALL MAGNITUDE HAVING GROWN STEADILY ON ITS MERITS YEAR BY YEAR UNTIL IT HAS NOW ARRIVED AT A POINT WHERE ITS SALES RUN INTO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CELLS PER ANNUM FURNISHED LARGELY TO THE STEAM RAILROADS OF THE COUNTRY FOR THEIR SIGNAL SERVICE
THIS METHOD OF DRYING WAS ORIGINAL WITH EDISON
SOON A MESSAGE CAME FROM THE WAR DEPARTMENT TO SEND IMMEDIATELY FOR THE MANAGER OF THE CINCINNATI OFFICE
REFERRING TO THIS BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE MENTIONS A CURIOUS FACT THAT THROWS LIGHT ON HIS CEASELESS APPLICATION
AT ONE TIME WE EMPLOYED SEVERAL THOUSAND MEN
A FORM OF APPARATUS PRODUCED DURING THE EARLY DAYS OF THE TELEPHONE BY PROFESSOR HUGHES OF ENGLAND FOR THE PURPOSE OF RENDERING FAINT INDISTINCT SOUNDS DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE DEPENDED FOR ITS OPERATION ON THE CHANGES THAT RESULT IN THE RESISTANCE OF LOOSE CONTACTS
THE ACTUAL RELAYING WAS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF TWO CONTACTS MAKING CONNECTION WITH THE LOCAL OR RELAY CIRCUIT

A SERIES OF POSITIVE TUBES WERE FILLED WITH THE TWO MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS--SAY NINE PARTS HYDRATE TO ONE OF FLAKE

IN ONE BOOK APPEAR THE DETAILS OF ONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS ON SEPTEMBER 3 1891 AT 4.30 A.M WITH THE COMMENT
AFTER FOX HAD HIS SHOULDER TREATED WITH ARNICA AT THE GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL TENT WE RETURNED TO RAWLINS THE ECLIPSE WAS HOWEVER THE PRIME CONSIDERATION AND EDISON FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF HIS COLLEAGUES IN MAKING READY
NEVER HURRIED HIMSELF
28 1878 203,016 SPEAKING MACHINES
WITH SUCH AN INSTRUMENT AS THE ABOVE EDISON DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF HEAT IN THE CORONA AT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN BUT EXACT DETERMINATIONS COULD NOT BE MADE AT THAT TIME BECAUSE THE TASIMETER ADJUSTMENT WAS TOO DELICATE AND AT THE BEST THE GALVANOMETER DEFLECTIONS WERE SO MARKED THAT THEY COULD NOT BE KEPT WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE SCALE
GLUCOSE 10 LBS
HE PICKED UP THE PIECE OF WIRE TOOK IT TO THE STATION WEIGHED IT CAREFULLY AND FOUND THAT IT ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT $150 WORTH OF ELECTRICITY WHICH WAS THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE EDISON HIMSELF IS HOWEVER THE BEST REPERTORY OF STORIES WHEN IT COMES TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THAT EARLY PERIOD IN CONNECTION WITH METERING THE CURRENT AND CHARGING FOR IT
HENCE A SQUARE WIRE OR OTHER MEANS SUCH AS A SPIRAL WITHIN A SPIRAL MUST BE USED
THE BOXES UNDER THE SEAT WERE STILL RETAINED IN SERVICE
ONE EVENING THERE CAME A SUDDEN FLASH OF FIRE AND A SPLUTTERING SIZZLING NOISE
THE DEEP INTEREST FINANCIAL AND MORAL AND FRIENDLY BACKING I RECEIVED FROM MR EDISON TOGETHER WITH VALUABLE SUGGESTIONS ENABLED ME TO BRING OUT THE ENGINE
HE HAD ALSO MADE COLLATERAL STUDIES OF IRON STEEL AND COPPER INSULATION WINDING ETC
HIS WORK WAS EXCELLENT THROUGHOUT AND THE RESULTS WERE HIGHLY SATISFACTORY SO FAR AS THEY COULD POSSIBLY BE WITH THE ARRANGEMENT ORIGINALLY PLANNED BY MR EDISON AND HIS ASSISTANTS
24 1892 1893 509,428 COMPOSITION BRICK AND MAKING SAME
THESE WERE BUILT UP TO A HEIGHT OF ABOUT TWO AND A HALF FEET AND EACH WAS SURMOUNTED WITH A SINGLE HEAVY SLAB OF BLACK MARBLE
SUCH WORK HAD NOT LED VERY FAR THE LAMPS WERE HOPELESSLY SHORT-LIVED AND EVERYTHING WAS OBVIOUSLY EXPERIMENTAL
CARE HAD TO BE TAKEN THAT THE WOUND CORE CORRESPONDED TO THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT SUPPOSING IT WERE PLACED IN A FIELD AND REVOLVED
THIS IS OUR MACHINERY
AN IMAGINATION REQUIRES AN APPRECIABLE TIME FOR ITS EXERCISE AND AS THE STUFF WAS COMING AT THE RATE OF THIRTY-FIVE TO FORTY WORDS A MINUTE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO WRITE DOWN WHAT WAS COMING AND IMAGINE WHAT WASN'T COMING
MANY SCENES FAMILIAR TO THE READER SHOWING AUTOMOBILES TEARING ALONG THE ROAD AND ROUNDING CORNERS AT AN APPARENTLY RECKLESS SPEED ARE REALLY PICTURES OF SLOW AND DIGNIFIED MOVEMENTS REPRODUCED AT A HIGH SPEED
THIS IS SHOWN IN THE TWO FIGURES OF FIG
AFTER THE MACHINE WAS COMPLETED WE FOUND THE VOLTAGE WAS TOO LOW

EDISON HAS SAID THAT HE NEVER SAW A STATEMENT IN ANY BOOK AS TO SUCH THINGS THAT HE DID NOT INVOLUNTARILY CHALLENGE AND WISH TO DEMONSTRATE AS EITHER RIGHT OR WRONG
AT NIGHT MYSELF AND A COMPANION WOULD GO OVER TO A GORGEOUSLY FURNISHED FARO-BANK AND GET OUR MIDNIGHT LUNCH
AND ALL THE CARICATURISTS DEVELOPED IT ABNORMALLY
LONG AGO BY A CLOSE PROCESS OF REASONING HE HAD CLEARLY SEEN THAT THE ONLY ROAD TO IT WAS THROUGH THE PATH HE HAD TRAVELLED AND WHICH WAS NOW EMBODIED IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF HIS INCANDESCENT LAMP--NAMELY A FILAMENT OR CARBON OF HIGH RESISTANCE AND SMALL RADIATING SURFACE SEALED INTO A GLASS GLOBE EXHAUSTED OF AIR TO A HIGH DEGREE OF VACUUM
THE ENGINE WAS ONE OF A NUMBER LEASED TO THE GRAND TRUNK BY THE CHICAGO BURLINGTON QUINCY
THEIR PAGES COVER PRACTICALLY EVERY DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE
I THEN PUT UP A LONG SHAFT CONNECTING ALL THE GOVERNORS TOGETHER AND THOUGHT THIS WOULD CERTAINLY CURE THE TROUBLE
HE READ A GREAT DEAL BUT SPENT MOST OF HIS LEISURE IN EXPERIMENT
I WAS SITTING TO ONE SIDE GRASPING THE ANGLE BRACE SO NO HARM WAS DONE THIS WELCOME VACATION LASTED NEARLY TWO MONTHS
THE NAME OF THE TICKER CAME THROUGH THE CASUAL REMARK OF AN OBSERVER TO WHOM THE NOISE WAS THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE OF THE MECHANISM
EDISON PERCEIVED IN THIS PRODUCT THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN WORKING BECAUSE THE FILM PRESENTED A VERY LIGHT BODY OF TOUGH MATERIAL ON WHICH RELATIVELY LARGE PHOTOGRAPHS COULD BE TAKEN AT RAPID INTERVALS
I THINK GOULD'S SUCCESS WAS DUE TO ABNORMAL DEVELOPMENT
7 MEN WHOSE INVENTIONS WOULD HAVE CREATED WEALTH OF MILLIONS HAVE BEEN RUINED AND PREVENTED FROM MAKING ANY MONEY WHEREBY THEY COULD CONTINUE THEIR CAREERS AS CREATORS OF WEALTH FOR THE GENERAL GOOD JUST BECAUSE THE EXPERTS BEFUDDLED THE JUDGE BY THEIR MISLEADING STATEMENTS FOOTNOTE 7
WORK WAS FORGOTTEN FOR THE TIME AND ALL HANDS WERE READY FOR FUN
BESIDES THAT THE CHANGE WILL PUT THE HUMANE SOCIETIES OUT OF BUSINESS
WE REFER FIRST TO THE GREAT TRAVELLING HOISTING-CRANE HAVING A SPAN OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN FEET AND USED FOR HOISTING LOADS EQUAL TO TEN TONS THIS BEING THE LARGEST OF THE KIND MADE UP TO THAT TIME AND AFTERWARD USED AS A MODEL BY MANY OTHERS
IN FACT THE SHORT CANAL WAS ONE OF THE LAST EFFORTS OF ITS KIND IN THIS COUNTRY TO COMPETE WITH THE NEW MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION
THE MAGNETIC SEPARATORS AT FIRST USED BY EDISON AT THIS PLANT WERE OF THE SAME GENERALITY AS THE ONES EMPLOYED SOME YEARS PREVIOUSLY IN THE SEPARATION OF SEA-SHORE SAND BUT GREATLY ENLARGED AND IMPROVED
ALSO MEANS AND METHODS FOR ESTABLISHING THE INTERIOR CIRCUITS THAT WERE TO CARRY CURRENT TO CHANDELIERS AND FIXTURES IN BUILDINGS
THE OTHER MAN COULD NOT AND SO WE LET HIM OUT

THE NEW YORK TIMES CAME OUT NEXT DAY WITH A FULL ACCOUNT
BUT ON CAREFUL TEST THEY WERE FOUND INFERIOR TO THE JAPANESE BAMBOO AND HENCE REJECTED

IT COVERED FUNDAMENTALLY MULTIPLE ARC DISTRIBUTION HOW BROADLY WILL BE UNDERSTOOD FROM THE FOLLOWING EXTRACTS FROM THE NEW YORK ELECTRICAL REVIEW OF SEPTEMBER 10 1887
WE TRIED THE INDUCED CURRENT FROM OUR INDUCTION COIL HAVING ONE CELL ON PRIMARY THE SPARK JUMPING ABOUT ONE-FIFTIETH OF AN INCH THE TERMINAL OF THE SECONDARY CONNECTED TO THE FROG AND IT STRAIGHTENED OUT WITH VIOLENCE

THE FIRST THEATRE IN THE UNITED STATES TO BE LIGHTED BY AN EDISON ISOLATED PLANT WAS THE BIJOU THEATRE BOSTON
THE YOUNG MEN WHO THUS FLOATED ABOUT THE COUNTRY FROM ONE TELEGRAPH OFFICE TO ANOTHER WERE OFTEN BRILLIANT OPERATORS NOTED FOR SPEED IN SENDING AND RECEIVING BUT THEY WERE UNDISCIPLINED WERE WITHOUT THE RESTRAINING INFLUENCES OF HOME LIFE AND WERE SO HIGHLY PAID FOR THEIR WORK THAT THEY COULD INDULGE FREELY IN DISSIPATION IF INCLINED THAT WAY

HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THAT MACHINE WHEN THE WIRES WERE CONNECTED COULD STOP HIS ENGINE
IT RELATED TO THE USE OF A RETRACTILE SPRING TO WITHDRAW THE ARMATURE LEVER FROM THE MAGNET OF A TELEGRAPH OR OTHER RELAY OR SOUNDER AND THUS CONTROLLED THE ART OF TELEGRAPHY EXCEPT IN SIMPLE CIRCUITS
WHILE THE ART WAS IN THIS INEFFICIENT CONDITION EDISON WENT TO WORK ON THE SUBJECT AND IN DUE TIME AS WE HAVE ALREADY LEARNED INVENTED AND BROUGHT OUT THE CARBON TRANSMITTER WHICH IS UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAVE BEEN THE NEEDED DEVICE THAT GAVE TO THE TELEPHONE THE ELEMENT OF COMMERCIAL PRACTICABILITY AND HAS SINCE LED TO ITS PHENOMENALLY RAPID ADOPTION AND WORLD-WIDE USE
CONSEQUENTLY IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITS INTERESTS AT ALL POINTS THE EDISON COMPANY HAD FOUND IT NECESSARY TO PURSUE A VIGOROUS POLICY OF INSTITUTING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE INFRINGERS OF THESE VARIOUS PATENTS AND IN ADDITION TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF SUITS ON THE LAMP ALONE NOT LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE OTHER SEPARATE ACTIONS INVOLVING SOME FIFTY OR MORE OF EDISON'S PRINCIPAL ELECTRIC-LIGHTING PATENTS WERE BROUGHT AGAINST CONCERNS WHICH WERE WRONGFULLY APPROPRIATING HIS IDEAS AND ACTIVELY COMPETING WITH HIS COMPANIES IN THE MARKET
THE ROCK BROKEN UP INTO PIECES ABOUT THE SIZE OF MARBLES HAVING BEEN DRIED AND CONVEYED TO THE STOCK-HOUSE THE SURPLUSAGE WAS AUTOMATICALLY CARRIED OUT FROM THE OTHER END OF THE STOCK-HOUSE BY CONVEYORS TO PASS THROUGH THE NEXT PROCESS BY WHICH IT WAS REDUCED TO A POWDER
THE CARBON TRANSMITTER DISPLACED BELL'S MAGNETIC TRANSMITTER AND UNDER SEVERAL FORMS OF CONSTRUCTION REMAINS THE ONLY COMMERCIAL INSTRUMENT
SOME HAVE NOT YET BEEN REALIZED
WHEN I CAME INTO THE BOX THE ORCHESTRA PLAYED THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE AROSE
AND GOT NOTHING BUT ROAST BEEF AND FLOUNDERS AND MY IMAGINATION WAS GETTING INTO A COMA
IN THESE LATER DAYS WHEN THESE IDEAS OF EDISON ARE USED AS COMMON PROPERTY AND ARE APPLIED IN EVERY MODERN SYSTEM OF DISTRIBUTION IT IS ASTONISHING TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN THEY WERE PROPOUNDED THEY MET WITH MOST VEHEMENT ANTAGONISM FROM THE WORLD AT LARGE EDISON FAMILIAR WITH BATTERIES IN TELEGRAPHY COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO BELIEVE THAT ANY SUBSTITUTE GENERATOR OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY COULD BE EFFICIENT THAT USED UP HALF ITS OWN POSSIBLE OUTPUT BEFORE DOING AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF OUTSIDE WORK
28 1900 684,204 REVERSIBLE GALVANIC BATTERY
MR EDISON IS PREEMINENT IN THE REALM OF ENGINEERING THE PHENOMENAL GROWTH OF THE COPPER INDUSTRY WAS DUE TO A RAPID AND EVER-INCREASING DEMAND OWING TO THE EXPLOITATION OF THE TELEPHONE ELECTRIC LIGHT ELECTRIC MOTOR AND ELECTRIC RAILWAY INDUSTRIES
EDISON HAS INSISTED THAT CENTRAL STATIONS ARE SELLING LIGHT AND NOT CURRENT
IN OTHER WORDS IT IS A DEPOSITION BATH CONSISTING OF A GLASS CELL IN WHICH TWO PLATES OF CHEMICALLY PURE ZINC ARE DIPPED IN A SOLUTION OF ZINC SULPHATE
THE DEVICE WAS COVERED BY A PATENT ISSUED TO HIM ON NOVEMBER 21 1899 NO
IT WAS THE ONLY SIZE OF DYNAMO THAT THE EDISON COMPANY HAD MARKETED AT THAT TIME

AND THEN ON MY WAY HOME I WENT WITH HELMHOLTZ AND SIEMENS IN A PRIVATE COMPARTMENT TO THE MEETING OF THE GERMAN ASSOCIATION OF SCIENCE AT HEIDELBERG AND SPENT TWO DAYS THERE
EDISON'S FRIEND GENERAL LEFFERTS HAD BECOME EXCITED AND WAS DETERMINED TO INVEST A LARGE SUM OF MONEY IN THE MOTOR COMPANY BUT KNOWING EDISON'S INTIMATE FAMILIARITY WITH ALL ELECTRICAL SUBJECTS HE WAS WISE ENOUGH TO ASK HIS YOUNG EXPERT TO GO AND SEE THE MOTOR WITH HIM
BUT CONSIDERABLE SKILL WAS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN GOOD RESULTS AND GREAT DIFFICULTY WAS EXPERIENCED IN MEETING THE VARIATIONS IN THE WAX-LIKE CYLINDERS DUE TO THE WARPING UNDER ATMOSPHERIC CHANGES

RETURNING TO THE MORE SPECIFIC SUBJECT OF PIONEER PLANTS OF IMPORTANCE THAT AT BROCKTON MUST BE CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT CHIEFLY FOR THE REASON THAT THE CITY WAS THE FIRST IN THE WORLD TO POSSESS AN EDISON STATION DISTRIBUTING CURRENT THROUGH AN UNDERGROUND THREE-WIRE NETWORK OF CONDUCTORS--THE ESSENTIALLY MODERN CONTEMPORANEOUS PRACTICE STANDARD TWENTY-FIVE YEARS LATER
SOME INVENTORS HAVE CLAIMED THE POWER TO INDEFINITELY DIVIDE THE ELECTRIC CURRENT NOT KNOWING OR FORGETTING THAT SUCH A STATEMENT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE WELL-PROVEN LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY SOME INVENTORS IN THE LAST SENTENCE JUST QUOTED PROBABLY--INDEED WE THINK UNDOUBTEDLY--REFERS TO EDISON WHOSE EARLIER WORK IN ELECTRIC LIGHTING 1878 HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED IN THIS COUNTRY AND ABROAD AND WHO HAD THEN STATED BOLDLY HIS CONVICTION OF THE PRACTICABILITY OF THE SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT

I FOUND OUT THAT THE REASON FOR THIS OFFER WAS THAT HE HAD HAD TROUBLE WITH MR MORGAN AND WANTED TO GET EVEN WITH HIM WALL STREET IS IN FACT A FREQUENT OBJECT OF RATHER SARCASTIC REFERENCE APPLYING EVEN TO ITS REGULAR AND PROBABLY CORRECT METHODS OF BANKING
HE HAD LIVED AND WORKED IN SOUTH AMERICA AND WAS VERY EMPHATIC IN HIS ASSERTION AS HE SHOOK HIS YELLOW BONY FINGER AT THEM THAT THE WORST MISTAKE THEY COULD POSSIBLY MAKE WOULD BE TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES
THE TYPE-MAGNET ADVANCES THE LETTER AND FIGURE WHEELS ONE STEP WHEN THE MAGNET IS ENERGIZED AND A SUCCEEDING STEP WHEN THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN

BEFORE THE VISITOR CAN FULLY EXPLAIN HIS SIDE OF THE MATTER SOME POINT IS BROUGHT UP THAT STARTS EDISON OFF AGAIN AND NEW ARGUMENTS FROM HIS VIEWPOINT ARE POURED FORTH
INDEED SO MUCH SO THAT AFTER FURTHER EXPERIMENTS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATIONS EDISON WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS NOW ON THE RIGHT TRACK FOR MAKING A THOROUGHLY STABLE COMMERCIAL LAMP
THEREFORE AFTER A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THESE CASES IT IS NO CRITICISM OF THE COURTS TO SAY THAT BOTH SIDES HAVE FOUND ABUNDANT AND ABOUT AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY TO SUSTAIN THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTENTIONS AND AS A RESULT COUNSEL HAVE SUBMITTED IN BRIEFS A SUM TOTAL OF 225 CLOSELY PRINTED PAGES IN WHICH THEY HAVE CLEARLY YET ALMOST TO A MATHEMATICAL CERTAINTY DEMONSTRATED ON THE ONE SIDE THAT THIS SCHRADER MACHINE IS NEW AND PATENTABLE AND ON THE OTHER THAT IT IS OLD AND NOT SO

IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE DAY ON WHICH I SET OUT FELL ON WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY AND I SUGGESTED TO MY BOYS AND GIRLS AT SCHOOL THAT THEY MAKE A LINE ACROSS THE STATION PLATFORM NEAR THE SCHOOL AT MAPLEWOOD AND FROM THIS LINE I WOULD START EASTWARD AROUND THE WORLD AND IF GOOD-FORTUNE SHOULD BRING ME BACK I WOULD MEET THEM FROM THE WESTWARD AT THE SAME LINE
EDISON'S DAY IS TWENTY-FOUR HOURS LONG FOR HE HAS ALWAYS WORKED WHENEVER THERE WAS ANYTHING TO DO WHETHER DAY OR NIGHT AND CARRIED A FORCE OF NIGHT WORKERS SO THAT HIS EXPERIMENTS COULD GO ON CONTINUALLY
EVEN THOUGH THIS YOUNG MAN AT MENLO PARK HAD DONE SOME WONDERFUL THINGS FOR TELEGRAPHY AND TELEPHONY
BUT IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER EXCLUDED FROM THE HOME LIBRARY AND EDISON HAS ALL HIS LIFE ENJOYED IT PARTICULARLY THE WORKS OF SUCH WRITERS AS VICTOR HUGO AFTER WHOM BECAUSE OF HIS ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRATION--POSSIBLY ALSO BECAUSE OF HIS IMAGINATION--HE WAS NICKNAMED BY HIS FELLOW-OPERATORS VICTOR HUGO EDISON ELECTRICITY AT THAT MOMENT COULD HAVE NO ALLURE FOR A YOUTHFUL MIND

THE EQUIPMENT OF SUCH A SYSTEM AT EACH END OF THE LINE CONSISTS OF THESE TWO INSTRUMENTS TOGETHER WITH THE SPECIAL FORM OF TRANSMITTER AND THE POLE-CHANGER AND THEIR KEYS FOR ACTUATING THE NEUTRAL AND POLAR RELAYS AT THE OTHER OR DISTANT END
OPINIONS OF THIS NATURE HAVE EVER BEEN BUT A STIMULUS TO EDISON WHEN HE HAS GIVEN DEEP THOUGHT TO A SUBJECT AND HAS BECOME IMPRESSED WITH STRONG CONVICTIONS OF POSSIBILITY AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THE SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT--OR MORE CORRECTLY THE SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT--WAS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT ENTIRELY PRACTICABLE
THE EARLIER INVESTIGATORS INCLUDING THOSE UP TO THE PERIOD ABOVE NAMED THOUGHT OF THE PROBLEM AS INVOLVING THE SUBDIVISION OF A FIXED UNIT OF CURRENT WHICH BEING SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE ILLUMINATION BY ONE LARGE LAMP MIGHT BE DIVIDED INTO A NUMBER OF SMALL UNITS WHOSE AGGREGATE LIGHT WOULD EQUAL THE CANDLE-POWER OF THIS LARGE LAMP
THE CRANE TRIAL WAS TOO SHORT TO SETTLE THE QUESTION TO WHAT EXTENT THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT MAY BE CARRIED
BUT AS THEY WOULD TEND TO CHANGE THE FORM OF THIS NARRATIVE INTO A HISTORY OF ECONOMY IN MANUFACTURE IT WILL SUFFICE TO MENTION BUT ONE AND THAT A RECENT OCCURRENCE WHICH SERVES TO ILLUSTRATE HOW CLOSELY HE KEEPS IN TOUCH WITH EVERYTHING AND ALSO HOW THE INVENTIVE FACULTY AND INSTINCT OF COMMERCIAL ECONOMY RUN CLOSE TOGETHER

ATTEMPTS AT SETTLEMENT WERE MADE IN THEIR BEHALF AND DRAGGED WEARILY DUE APPARENTLY TO THE FACT THAT THE PLANS WERE BLOCKED BY GENERAL ECKERT WHO HAD IN SOME MANNER TAKEN OFFENCE AT A TRANSACTION EFFECTED WITHOUT HIS ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN ALL THE DETAILS
THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS RUSH INTO THE ELECTRIC-RAILWAY FIELD AFTER 1883 AND AN OUTBURST OF INVENTIVE ACTIVITY THAT HAS RARELY IF EVER BEEN EQUALLED

IT IS TRUE THAT THE TOWER COMMANDED A PRETTY VIEW BY LAND AND WATER BUT COLONEL SELLERS HIMSELF MIGHT HAVE PROJECTED THIS ENTERPRISE AS A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF STEADY INCOME
EDISON HIMSELF WAS IN UNIVERSAL REQUEST AND THE SUBJECT OF MUCH ADULATION BUT ALTOGETHER TOO BUSY AND MODEST TO BE SPOILED BY IT
I CALLED THE ATTENTION OF THE OTHER OPERATORS TO THE CROWD AND WE SENT A MESSENGER BOY TO FIND THE CAUSE OF THE EXCITEMENT

THE NEXT STEP WAS TO DIVIDE THE REGION INTO A NUMBER OF SUB-DISTRICTS AND INSTITUTE A HOUSE-TO-HOUSE CANVASS TO ASCERTAIN PRECISELY THE DATA AND CONDITIONS PERTINENT TO THE PROJECT
I CABLED BACK I WOULD ACCEPT
AND THAT THEIR VALUE IS IN THEIR SCARCITY AND IN THE VARIETY OF MEN WITH LOTS OF MONEY SOMEWHAT AKIN TO THIS IS A SHREWD COMMENT ON ONE FEATURE OF THE EXPOSITION
AND IN A WAY THE PLAN HAS BEEN HELPFUL TO THE WRITERS WHILE PROBABLY USEFUL TO THE READERS
THUS THE TRANSMISSION OF MORSE DOTS AND DASHES BY THE DISTANT OPERATOR RESULTED IN MOVEMENTS OF CORRESPONDING LENGTH BY THE FRICTIONAL PAD AND VIBRATING ARM
BUT IN VIEWING AN EXHIBITION OF THOUSANDS OF THESE BEAUTIFUL GEMS THE EYE AND BRAIN ARE SIMPLY BEWILDERED WITH THE RICHNESS OF A DISPLAY WHICH TENDS TO CONFUSE THE INTELLECT UNTIL THE FUNCTION OF ANALYSIS COMES INTO PLAY AND LEADS TO MORE ADEQUATE APPREHENSION
I MIGHT REMARK IN THIS CONNECTION THAT YEARS AFTERWARD I APPLIED TO THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY ASKING THEM IF THEY WOULD NOT LIKE TO PAY ME THIS MONEY AS IT WAS SPENT WHEN I WAS VERY HARD UP AND MADE THE COMPANY A SUCCESS AND WAS THE FOUNDATION OF THEIR PRESENT PROSPERITY
ALL WE DID WAS TO GO TO THE STORE ETC SAY WE WERE TELEGRAPH MEN AND WANTED TO GO UP TO THE WIRES ON THE ROOF
5 1882 439,392 ELECTRIC LIGHTING SYSTEM AUG
IT WAS FOUND OUT A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTERWARD THAT THERE WERE THREE NIGHT OPERATORS AT LOUISVILLE
MR VANDERBILT AND HIS WIFE AND SOME OF HIS DAUGHTERS CAME IN AND WERE THERE A FEW MINUTES WHEN A FIRE OCCURRED
HE RETURNED IN A FEW MINUTES AND SHOUTED LINCOLN'S SHOT INSTINCTIVELY THE OPERATORS LOOKED FROM ONE FACE TO ANOTHER TO SEE WHICH MAN HAD RECEIVED THE NEWS
I TOLD HIM I HAD A MACHINE THAT WOULD RECORD AND REPRODUCE THE HUMAN VOICE
IN ITS EARLIER FORMS THE IMPROVED PHONOGRAPH WAS NOT CAPABLE OF SUCH GENERAL NON-EXPERT HANDLING AS IS THE MACHINE OF THE PRESENT DAY AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE WAS A CONSTANT ENDEAVOR ON EDISON'S PART TO SIMPLIFY THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MACHINE AND ITS MANNER OF OPERATION
WEIR OR CHARLIE AS HE WAS KNOWN AT THAT TIME AGENT FOR THE ADAMS EXPRESS COMPANY HAD THE REMARKABLE ABILITY OF TAKING MESSAGES AND COPYING THEM TWENTY-FIVE WORDS BEHIND THE SENDER
AND THEN THIS IRON-ORE DUST MUST BE PUT INTO SUCH SHAPE THAT IT COULD BE COMMERCIALLY SHIPPED AND USED
THE DEFENCE ALLEGED THE GOEBEL ANTICIPATION IN SUPPORT OF WHICH IT OFFERED IN EVIDENCE FOUR LAMPS NOS
AS IN ENGLAND MR EDISON WAS FORTUNATE IN SECURING THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE OF SIR RICHARD WEBSTER AFTERWARD LORD CHIEF JUSTICE OF ENGLAND SO IN AMERICA IT COUNTED GREATLY IN HIS FAVOR TO ENJOY THE ADVOCACY OF SUCH A MAN AS LOWREY PROMINENT AMONG THE FAMOUS LEADERS OF THE NEW YORK BAR
24 1901 827,089 CALCINING FURNACES DEC
THEY DROVE THE HORSES WITH A FIRE-BELL IN FRONT OF THEM TO THE FRENCH PIER THE POLICEMEN LINING THE STREETS
AFTER EDISON HAD FINISHED EXHIBITING ALL THE GOOD POINTS OF HIS SYSTEM HE CONDUCTED HIS GUESTS UPSTAIRS IN THE LABORATORY WHERE A LONG TABLE WAS SPREAD WITH THE BEST THINGS THAT ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT NEW YORK CATERERS COULD FURNISH
AN ELECTROMAGNET WITH THE EMBOSSING POINT CONNECTED TO AN ARM TRAVELLED OVER THE DISK
WE HEARD A HEAVY TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP ON THE RICKETY STAIRS
A THREE-LEGGED SPIDER CONNECTED THE METAL RIM OF EACH FRONT WHEEL TO A BRASS HUB UPON WHICH RESTED A COLLECTING BRUSH
BUT IT WAS IN THE EFFORT TO CARRY THESE PRINCIPLES INTO PRACTICE THAT THERE AROSE THE NUMEROUS DIFFICULTIES THAT AT TIMES SEEMED INSURMOUNTABLE
12,393 SEPT
WE HAD ALSO THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED THE WONDERFUL DEPOSIT AT MESABA AND IT WAS WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE RELUCTANCE THAT MR EDISON WAS ABLE TO COME FINALLY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS THE CONCENTRATING PLANT COULD NOT THEN BE MADE A COMMERCIAL SUCCESS
WHEN THE NATURE OF A PATENT RIGHT IS CONSIDERED IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHY THIS SHOULD BE SO
REPRODUCTION OF MUSIC

AND NO IN THAT THE MECHANICALLY SUCCESSFUL AND COMMERCIALLY PRACTICAL RESULTS OBTAINED AFTER THE EXERCISE OF STUPENDOUS EFFORTS AND THE EXPENDITURE OF A FORTUNE ARE SO CONCLUSIVE THAT THEY MUST INEVITABLY BE THE RELIANCE OF MANY FUTURE IRON-MASTERS
GENERALLY POOREST DISTRICT FOR LIGHT BEST FOR POWER THUS EVENING UP WHOLE CITY--THE EFFECT OF THIS ON INVESTMENT IT IS POINTED OUT THAT PREVIOUS INVENTIONS FAILED--NECESSITIES FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS AND ACCOMPLISHMENT BY EDISON
FOR ADEQUATE INFORMATION HE MIGHT SEARCH IN VAIN THE BOOKS USUALLY REGARDED AS AUTHORITIES ON THE SUBJECT OF DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINERY FOR WITH SLIGHT EXCEPTIONS THERE HAS BEEN A SINGULAR UNANIMITY IN THE OMISSION OF WRITERS TO GIVE EDISON CREDIT FOR HIS GREAT AND BASIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEAVY-CURRENT TECHNICS ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL MEN TO HAVE LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR THE EFFICIENCY OF AND TO BE EMBODIED IN ALL MODERN GENERATORS OF CURRENT
OH THE FIRST MANIFESTATION OF THE UNUSUAL PHENOMENA IN NOVEMBER 1875 EDISON'S KEENNESS OF PERCEPTION LED HIM AT ONCE TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED A NEW FORCE
HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE-LADDIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
THE TORSION OF THE SHAFT WAS SO GREAT THAT ONE GOVERNOR STILL MANAGED TO GET AHEAD OF THE OTHERS
THIS SQUARE IS STILL COVERED WITH FINE PRIMEVAL FOREST TREES AND HAS AT ITS CENTRE A HANDSOME SOLDIERS MONUMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR TO WHICH FOUR PAVED WALKS CONVERGE
BUT THE EDISON AUTOGRAPH THUS AND THEN WRITTEN NOW SHOWS THE PAPER EATEN OUT BY THE ACID USED ALTHOUGH COVERED WITH GLASS FOR MANY YEARS
WELL FOR A YEAR OR SO THE KILN PROBLEM WAS A NIGHTMARE TO ME
BY A GREAT AMOUNT OF PERSISTENCE I GOT PERMISSION FROM MY MOTHER TO GO ON THE LOCAL TRAIN AS A NEWSBOY
I WANTED A JOB HE SAID AND WAS AMBITIOUS TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE DYNAMO-ROOM
EDISON CAN TRAVEL ALONG A WELL-USED ROAD AND STILL FIND VIRGIN SOIL REMARKED RECENTLY ONE OF HIS MOST PRACTICAL EXPERIMENTERS WHO HAD BEEN WORKING ALONG A CERTAIN LINE WITHOUT ATTAINING THE DESIRED RESULT
ACCORDING TO AFFIDAVITS OF GOEBEL HIMSELF AND SOME OF HIS FAMILY NOTHING THAT WOULD ANTICIPATE EDISON'S CLAIM HAD BEEN OMITTED FROM HIS WORK FOR HE GOEBEL CLAIMED TO HAVE EMPLOYED THE ALL-GLASS GLOBE INTO WHICH WERE SEALED PLATINUM WIRES CARRYING A TENUOUS CARBON FILAMENT FROM WHICH THE OCCLUDED GASES HAD BEEN LIBERATED DURING THE PROCESS OF HIGH EXHAUSTION
IT WILL BE OF BENEFIT TO SOME ONE SOME TIME SIMILARLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE STORAGE BATTERY AFTER HAVING EXPERIMENTED CONTINUOUSLY FOR THREE YEARS IT WAS FOUND TO FALL BELOW HIS EXPECTATIONS AND ITS MANUFACTURE HAD TO BE STOPPED
HE GAVE US PERMISSION--TOLD US TO GO AHEAD AND HE WOULD SEE IT WAS ALL RIGHT
THE CENTRE OF THIS SPACIOUS ROOM IS AN OPEN RECTANGULAR SPACE ABOUT FORTY BY TWENTY-FIVE FEET RISING CLEAR ABOUT FORTY FEET FROM THE MAIN FLOOR TO A PANELLED CEILING
SHE WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING
WHEN SIR WILLIAM THOMSON KELVIN CAME IN THE ROOM HE WAS INTRODUCED TO ME AND HAD A NUMBER OF FRIENDS WITH HIM
HE IS THE INVENTOR OF WONDERFUL NEW APPARATUS AND THE EXPLOITER OF NOVEL AND SUCCESSFUL ARTS
IN ONE SMALL APARTMENT THERE WERE TWO BARRELS OF POTATOES AND A THIRD ONE NEARLY EMPTY
ENTIRE ABSENCE OF CORROSIVE FUMES
THIS CONSTANT INTERRUPTION IS TAKEN BY MANY TO MEAN THAT EDISON HAS A SMALL OPINION OF ANY ARGUMENTS THAT OPPOSE HIM
MARCH 27,1885 486,634 SYSTEM OF RAILWAY SIGNALLING--EDISON AND GILLILAND
HE SAYS
HE SAYS
HE SAYS
HE SAYS
BUT IN HIS CHOSEN FIELD AS AN INVENTOR AND AS A PATENTEE HIS REWARD HAS BEEN EMPTY
IT WAS IN JUNE AND CHINNOCK PUT IN A BILL FOR $20
AS THE LATTER MOVES UP AND DOWN THE PINS PLAY UPON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE LOWER ARM OF THE ROCKING-LEVER THUS CANTING IT AND PUSHING THE TYPE-WHEELS TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT AS THE CASE MAY BE
AND FINALLY ONE DAY HE SAID TO THE ASSEMBLED EXPERIMENTERS IN THE TOP ROOM OF THE LABORATORY
THE LATHES WERE WORKED RIGHT OUT IN THE STREET AND BELTED THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE SHOP AT LAST IT BECAME NECESSARY TO MOVE FROM GOERCK STREET AND MR EDISON GIVES A VERY INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSFER OF THE PLANT TO SCHENECTADY NEW YORK
THE STORY THOUGH INTERESTING IS NOT FOUNDED ON FACT
19 1881 406,824 ELECTRIC METER JAN
THEY BOTH TOOK A DEEP INTEREST IN ALL THEY SAW
SO I GOT UP A SCHEME OF A THIRD RAIL AND SHOE AND ERECTED IT IN MY YARD HERE IN ORANGE
THESE MAY BE SEEN IN A DIAGRAM REPRODUCED FROM THE ABOVE-NAMED ARTICLE IN THE IRON AGE AND SUPPLEMENTED BY THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT FROM THE ELECTRICAL ENGINEER NEW YORK OCTOBER 28 1897
IRRITATING AS IT WAS TO BE FORCED INTO THE POSITION OF COMBATING A PROPOSITION SO WELL KNOWN TO BE PREPOSTEROUS AND INSINCERE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT TO FIGHT THIS FABRICATION WITH ALL THE STRENUOUS AND DEADLY EARNESTNESS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO BEAR ON A REALLY MERITORIOUS DEFENCE
AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE EXPRESSION OF VOICE AND FACE IN WHICH HE SAID WITH SOME FOREIGN ACCENT
I ALSO SECURED SIXTEEN THOUSAND ACRES IN WHICH THE DEPOSIT WAS PROPORTIONATELY AS LARGE
POSSIBLY THIS HELPED TO SPOIL A LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEER BUT WENT TO MAKE A GREAT MASTER OF THE NEW MOTIVE POWER
HE MUST BE A REMARKABLE MAN IN SOME WALK OF LIFE

I HAD BEEN STAYING AT A LITTLE HOTEL IN COVENT GARDEN CALLED THE HUMMUMS
FOUR LAMPS OF ONLY 3/4 OF ONE BURNER AND FIVE LAMPS OF 1/4 OF A BURNER IT WOULD ALSO SEEM THAT ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL METHOD OF PLACING EXPERIMENTAL LAMPS IN MULTIPLE ARC WAS KNOWN AT THIS PERIOD THE IDEA OF DROP OF ELECTRICAL PRESSURE WAS IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD IF INDEED REALIZED AT ALL AS A MOST IMPORTANT ITEM TO BE CONSIDERED IN ATTEMPTING THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM
A QUAKER CARPENTER WHO STUDIED FIVE YEARS AT OBERLIN COLLEGE HE TOOK UP ELECTRICAL INVENTION AND BROUGHT OUT MANY INGENIOUS DEVICES IN RAPID SUCCESSION IN THE TELEGRAPHIC FIELD INCLUDING THE NOW UNIVERSAL NEEDLE ANNUNCIATOR FOR HOTELS ETC THE USEFUL TELAUTOGRAPH AUTOMATIC SELF-ADJUSTING RELAYS PRIVATE-LINE PRINTERS--LEADING UP TO HIS FAMOUS HARMONIC SYSTEM

EDISON THEN ONLY TWENTY-ONE HAD LESS BUSINESS EXPERIENCE THAN THE PROMOTER THROUGH WHOSE MANIPULATION HE SOON LOST HIS FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THIS EARLY TICKER ENTERPRISE
THE DECOMPOSITION OF WATER BY ELECTROLYTIC ACTION WAS RECOGNIZED AND MADE THE BASIS OF COMMUNICATING AT A DISTANCE EVEN BEFORE THE DAYS OF THE ELECTROMAGNET
THIS WAS PUT ON THE END OF A FISH-HOOK AND DRAWN ACROSS THE MEN'S FACES

O
MARSHALL LEFFERTS WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT
THE VALUE OF INSULATION AND MANY OTHERS WHICH UNFORTUNATE TO SAY REMAIN AS ESOTERIC NOW AS THEY WERE THEN EVER FRUITFUL THEMES OF CONTROVERSY
BUT RETURNING TO THE KILN MR EDISON WENT TO WORK IMMEDIATELY AND VERY SOON COMPLETED THE DESIGN OF A NEW TYPE WHICH WAS TO BE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET LONG AND NINE FEET IN DIAMETER MADE UP IN TEN-FOOT SECTIONS OF CAST IRON BOLTED TOGETHER AND ARRANGED TO BE REVOLVED ON FIFTEEN BEARINGS
AT THE END OF THE SCENE THE NEGATIVE IS DEVELOPED IN THE ORDINARY WAY AND IS THEN READY FOR USE IN THE PRINTING OF THE POSITIVES FOR SALE
THE DEMONSTRATION OF EDISON'S SUCCESS STIMULATED THE FAITH OF HIS FRENCH SUPPORTERS AND RENDERED EASIER THE COMPLETION OF PLANS FOR THE SOCIETE EDISON CONTINENTAL OF PARIS FORMED TO OPERATE THE EDISON PATENTS ON THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE
IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER IN THE ANNALS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENT THERE IS ANYTHING QUITE ANALOGOUS TO THE STORY OF THIS SEARCH AND THE VARIOUS EXPEDITIONS THAT WENT OUT FROM THE EDISON LABORATORY IN 1880 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS TO SCOUR THE EARTH FOR A MATERIAL SO APPARENTLY SIMPLE AS A HOMOGENEOUS STRIP OF BAMBOO OR OTHER SIMILAR FIBRE
FOR THE INFORMATION OF THOSE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE PROCESS OF MANUFACTURING PORTLAND CEMENT IT MAY BE STATED THAT THE MATERIAL CONSISTS PRELIMINARILY OF AN INTIMATE MIXTURE OF CEMENT ROCK AND LIMESTONE GROUND TO A VERY FINE POWDER
AND THIS PROVED TO BE CORRECT FOR AFTER A PROLONGED KNEADING AND ROLLING THE MASS CHANGED INTO A COHESIVE STRINGY HOMOGENEOUS PUTTY

THE NATURE OF CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
SAMUEL EDISON VERSATILE BUOYANT OF TEMPER AND EVER OPTIMISTIC WOULD THUS APPEAR TO HAVE PITCHED HIS TENT WITH SHREWD JUDGMENT
IN THIS AND OTHER WAYS THERE ARISES CONSTANTLY IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE A LARGE NUMBER OF CONTESTED CASES CALLED INTERFERENCES WHERE APPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS COVERING THE INVENTION OF A SIMILAR DEVICE HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENTLY FILED BY TWO OR EVEN MORE PERSONS
ALWAYS MODEST EDISON WAS SO OVERCOME HE COULD HARDLY SPEAK BUT HE MANAGED TO SAY FINALLY THAT AS HIS FRIEND MR ADAMS WAS BETTER EQUIPPED WITH CHEEK THAN HE WAS WE WOULD CHANGE PLACES AND HE WOULD DO THE DEMONSTRATING WHILE I EXPLAINED THE WHOLE THING
A SO-CALLED SHOOTING STAR OR A FLASH OF LIGHTNING PRODUCES THE SAME EFFECT
IN THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THE STOCK PRINTER EDISON REALIZED THE VITAL COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE OF HAVING ALL INSTRUMENTS RECORDING PRECISELY ALIKE AT THE SAME MOMENT AND IT WAS HE WHO FIRST DEVISED IN 1869 THE UNISON STOP BY MEANS OF WHICH ALL CONNECTED INSTRUMENTS COULD AT ANY MOMENT BE BROUGHT TO ZERO FROM THE CENTRAL TRANSMITTING STATION AND THUS BE MADE TO WORK IN CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE CENTRAL INSTRUMENT AND WITH ONE ANOTHER
THIS HAD BEEN GOING ON MORE THAN FIVE MONTHS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK WHEN I WAS CALLED DOWN TO THE LABORATORY TO SEE HIM
THAT STORIES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED UTTERLY WITHOUT FOUNDATION
HOPKINSON AND KAPP LATER ON
THE THOUGHT OF SUCH AN ENORMOUS LOSS WAS UNBEARABLE AND HE DID NOT REST UNTIL HE HAD INVENTED AND PUT INTO USE AN ENTIRELY NEW GRINDING-MACHINE WHICH WAS CALLED THE THREE-HIGH ROLLS
THE NORTH AMERICAN PHONOGRAPH COMPANY FAILED ITS PRINCIPAL CREDITOR BEING MR EDISON WHO HAVING ACQUIRED THE ASSETS OF THE DEFUNCT CONCERN ORGANIZED THE NATIONAL PHONOGRAPH COMPANY TO WHICH HE TURNED OVER THE PATENTS
THE NEW YORK GRAPHIC JULY 27 1880
AND BOTH WERE CUT ABOUT THE FACE AND HANDS BY THE GRAVEL BALLAST ON WHICH THEY FELL
HENCE EDISON SAW EARLY THE NECESSITY OF PROVIDING A PLACE ESPECIALLY DEVISED AND ARRANGED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF DRAMATIC PERFORMANCES IN PANTOMIME
WITH THE RESULTS OF THIS CANVASS BEFORE THEM THE SIZES OF THE MAIN CONDUCTORS TO BE LAID THROUGHOUT THE STREETS OF THIS ENTIRE TERRITORY WERE FIGURED BLOCK BY BLOCK
AND THUS MATTERS WENT ON UNTIL THE EARLY PART OF THE PRESENT DECADE WHEN THE FACTORY FACILITIES WERE BECOMING SO RAPIDLY OUTGROWN AS TO RENDER RADICAL CHANGES NECESSARY
THE LIMITATION TO THE USE OF GLASS HARD RUBBER OR SIMILAR CONTAINERS ON ACCOUNT OF THE ACTION OF THE ACID
ON PASSING OUT OF NO
WHEN EDISON SAW THEM I THOUGHT HE WOULD FAINT
HOWEVER THE INTENSE DARKNESS DILATED THE PUPILS OF OUR EYES SO AS TO MAKE THEM VERY SENSITIVE AND WE COULD JUST SEE AT TIMES THE OUTLINES OF THE ROAD
IN LATER LIFE HE WAS MANAGER OF THE LOCAL STREET RAILWAY LINES AT PORT HURON MICHIGAN IN WHICH HE WAS HEAVILY INTERESTED
MOREOVER AT THE PERIOD NOW DESCRIBED EDISON WAS THE VICTIM OF A DISHONEST PATENT SOLICITOR WHO DEPRIVED HIM OF A NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
VISITORS OF COURSE WERE NUMEROUS INCLUDING MANY CURIOUS SCEPTICAL RAILROAD MANAGERS FEW IF ANY OF WHOM EXCEPT VILLARD COULD SEE THE SLIGHTEST USE FOR THE NEW MOTIVE POWER

THE MOLDS REPRESENTED ABOVE ARE THOSE FOR STRAIGHT WORK SUCH AS WALLS AND FLOORS
DURING EDISON'S IMMATURE YEARS WHEN HE WAS FLITTING ABOUT FROM PLACE TO PLACE AS A TELEGRAPH OPERATOR HIS EXPERIMENTATION WAS OF A DESULTORY HAND-TO-MOUTH CHARACTER ALTHOUGH IT WAS ALWAYS NOTABLE FOR ORIGINALITY AS EXPRESSED IN A NUMBER OF MINOR USEFUL DEVICES PRODUCED DURING THIS PERIOD
BUT BEING RATHER DEAF I DIDN'T CATCH HIS NAME BUT SAT DOWN AND STARTED THE CURL DITTY
PREECE WHO HAVING BEEN SERIOUSLY SCEPTICAL AS TO MR EDISON'S RESULTS BECAME ONE OF HIS MOST ARDENT ADVOCATES AND DID MUCH TO FACILITATE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE LIGHT
SPRAGUE WHO ALSO GIVES A CURIOUS GLIMPSE OF THE GLORIOUS UNCERTAINTIES AND VICISSITUDES OF THAT FORMATIVE PERIOD
APPARENTLY AT THAT TIME--BETWEEN THE END OF 1881 AND SPRING OF 1882--THE MOST SERIOUS WORK WAS THE MANUFACTURE AND INSTALLATION OF UNDERGROUND CONDUCTORS IN THIS TERRITORY
I CAN'T STAND THIS ANY LONGER
THE EARLIER TYPES OF MACHINES WERE PROVIDED WITH SEPARATE SCREWS FOR EFFECTING THESE ADJUSTMENTS
WILL YOU LET MY BOOKKEEPER LOOK AT YOUR BOOKS WE SAID
16 1871 126,535 PRINTING TELEGRAPHS
THEN HE PROCEEDED TO PULL THE SWITCHBOARD AWAY FROM THE WALL
SOME IDEA OF THE CONFIDENCE INSPIRED BY THE FAME OF EDISON AT THIS PERIOD IS SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT THE FIRST THEATRE EVER LIGHTED FROM A CENTRAL STATION BY INCANDESCENT LAMPS WAS DESIGNED THIS YEAR AND OPENED IN 1884 AT BROCKTON WITH AN EQUIPMENT OF THREE HUNDRED LAMPS

WHEN IN ADDITION TO THIS INFERNAL LEAK THE WIRES NORTH TO CLEVELAND WORKED BADLY IT REQUIRED A LARGE AMOUNT OF IMAGINATION TO GET THE SENSE OF WHAT WAS BEING SENT
IN WHICH AFTER MENTIONING HIS STRUGGLE WITH ADVERSE CONDITIONS IT SAYS
PETROLEUM PITCH 10 LBS
AIR SEPARATION
ENDLESS LEATHER BELTING WAS USED TO TRANSMIT THE POWER FROM THE MOTOR TO THE COUNTER-SHAFT AND FROM THE LATTER TO THE DRIVING-WHEELS WHICH WERE THE FRONT PAIR
FIELD FOR THE COMBINATION OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR OPERATED BY MEANS OF A CURRENT FROM A STATIONARY DYNAMO OR SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY CONDUCTED THROUGH THE RAILS
SOME YEARS AGO WE HAD A BUSINESS NEGOTIATION IN NEW YORK WHICH MADE IT NECESSARY FOR MR EDISON AND ME TO VISIT THE CITY FIVE OR SIX TIMES WITHIN A COMPARATIVELY SHORT PERIOD
AS HE WAS A RAPID WORKMAN AND PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE CLOCK I TOOK A FANCY TO HIM AND GAVE HIM PIECE-WORK
THEY WOULD COME TO OUR OFFICE IN NEW YORK AT 65 TO TALK OVER THE SPECIFICATIONS THE COST AND OTHER THINGS
FOR TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION AND ILLUSTRATION OF THIS INVENTION SEE APPENDIX THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE-WIRE SYSTEM
15 1893 1896 865,367 FLUORESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP
THAT HE WAS ALREADY WELL QUALIFIED AS A BEGINNER IS EVIDENT FROM THE FACT THAT HE HAD MASTERED THE MORSE CODE OF THE TELEGRAPHIC ALPHABET AND WAS ABLE TO TAKE TO THE STATION A NEAT LITTLE SET OF INSTRUMENTS HE HAD JUST FINISHED WITH HIS OWN HANDS AT A GUN-SHOP IN DETROIT
SOON HE INCREASED HIS SPEED TO WHICH I EASILY ADAPTED MY PACE
THE OPERATOR SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE--THAT ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN TO SEND NO PRIVATE MESSAGES
HE THEN TURNED AROUND AND TO MY GREAT SURPRISE EXPLAINED THE WHOLE THING TO HIS FRIENDS
IT HAD A STEEL CORE WITH A COPPER RIBBON WOUND SPIRALLY AROUND IT AND TINNED TO THE CORE WIRE
A LARGE CABINET CONTAINS AWARDS DECORATIONS AND MEDALS PRESENTED TO EDISON ACCUMULATING IN THE COURSE OF A LONG CAREER SOME OF WHICH MAY BE SEEN IN THE ILLUSTRATION OPPOSITE
WE KNOW THAT SOUNDS ARE MADE BY VIBRATIONS AND ARE MADE SENSIBLE TO THE EAR BY THE SAME VIBRATIONS WHICH ARE REPRODUCED BY THE INTERVENING MEDIUM
BARKER OF PHILADELPHIA A BIG GOOD-NATURED PHILOSOPHER WHOSE VALUABLE ADVICE EDISON ESTEEMED HIGHLY
I WAS IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION THAN MOST OPERATORS TO CALL ON MY IMAGINATION TO SUPPLY MISSING WORDS OR SENTENCES WHICH WERE FREQUENT IN THOSE DAYS OF OLD ROTTEN WIRES BADLY INSULATED ESPECIALLY ON STORMY NIGHTS
ANOTHER IMPORTANT PLANT OF THIS PERIOD DESERVES SPECIAL MENTION AS IT WAS THE PIONEER IN THE LIGHTING OF LARGE SPACES BY INCANDESCENT LAMPS
IT WAS BISHOP VINCENT WHO HELPED LEWIS MILLER FOUND THE CHAUTAUQUA I EXHIBITED IT AND THEN HE ASKED IF HE COULD SPEAK A FEW WORDS

IN THE YEAR 1887 THE IDEA OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DEVISE AN INSTRUMENT WHICH SHOULD DO FOR THE EYE WHAT THE PHONOGRAPH DOES FOR THE EAR AND THAT BY A COMBINATION OF THE TWO ALL MOTION AND SOUND COULD BE RECORDED AND REPRODUCED SIMULTANEOUSLY
ITS THIN WIRES CAN BE CARRIED CHEAPLY OVER VAST AREAS AND AT EACH LOCAL POINT OF CONSUMPTION THE TRANSFORMER OF SIZE EXACTLY PROPORTIONED TO ITS LOCAL TASK TAKES THE HIGH-VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION CURRENT AND LOWERS ITS POTENTIAL AT A RATIO OF 20 OR 40 TO 1 FOR USE IN DISTRIBUTION AND CONSUMPTION CIRCUITS
REGULATORS FOR DYNAMOS AND MOTORS
OF THIS DEVICE MR EDISON REMARKS
HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN A MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES
WE WORKED ON A SELF-ADJUSTING TELEGRAPH RELAY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY VALUABLE IF WE COULD HAVE GOT IT
PREECE OF LONDON
WALLACE I BELIEVE I CAN BEAT YOU MAKING ELECTRIC LIGHTS
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY A GAME OF BILLIARDS NATURALLY THIS ASTONISHED ME VERY MUCH AS HE IS A MAN WHO CARES LITTLE OR NOTHING FOR THE ORDINARY GAMES WITH THE SINGLE EXCEPTION OF PARCHEESI OF WHICH HE IS VERY FOND
NEWSPAPER RECORDS AND THE PAGES OF THE TECHNICAL PAPERS OF THE DAY SHOW TO WHAT AN EXTENT PREJUDICE AND PASSION WERE STIRRED UP AND THE ASTOUNDING DEGREE TO WHICH THE OPPOSITION TO THE NEW LIGHT WAS CARRIED
ONE INCIDENT TELLS HOW HE WAS FOUND ONE DAY IN THE VILLAGE SQUARE COPYING LABORIOUSLY THE SIGNS OF THE STORES
ALSO AFFIDAVITS OF OTHER ACQUAINTANCES AND NEIGHBORS OF GOEBEL FLATLY DENYING THE EXHIBITIONS HE CLAIMED TO HAVE MADE
BUT FOR TWO WEEKS THEY COULD NOT FIND US SO THEY BECAME SOMEWHAT MORE ANXIOUS THAN WE WERE
IN REAL PRACTICE THIS SPECTACULAR PLAYING WITH SOUND VIBRATIONS AS IF THEY WERE LACROSSE BALLS TO TOSS AROUND BETWEEN THE GOALS COULD BE MATERIALLY SIMPLIFIED
IN MANY RESPECTS THE ATTAINMENT OF THESE SOMEWHAT CONFLICTING ENDS WAS THE MOST PERPLEXING OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH CONFRONTED MR EDISON
AWARDS ARE MADE BY A BOARD OF SIXTEEN ENGINEERS APPOINTED IN EQUAL NUMBERS FROM THE FOUR GREAT NATIONAL ENGINEERING SOCIETIES--THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING ENGINEERS THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS AND THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS WHOSE MEMBERSHIP EMBRACES THE VERY PICK AND FLOWER OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING TALENT IN AMERICA
THIS INVENTIVE PERIOD EXTENDED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS DURING WHICH TIME HE TOOK OUT FORTY-SIX PATENTS ON STOCK-PRINTING INSTRUMENTS AND DEVICES TWO OF SUCH PATENTS BEING ISSUED TO EDISON AND POPE AS JOINT INVENTORS
YOU WERE THE ONE TO MAKE THAT VERY DISTINCTION
TO-DAY I CAN SEE THOSE LAMPS RISING TO A CHERRY RED LIKE GLOWBUGS AND HEAR MR EDISON SAYING A LITTLE MORE JUICE AND THE LAMPS BEGAN TO GLOW
SIEMENS WAS VERY FOND OF THESE STORIES AND WOULD LAUGH IMMENSELY AT THEM AND COULD SEE THE POINTS AND THE HUMOR BY HIS IMAGINATION
THEN CAME THE OVERHEAD CIRCUITS FOR DISTRIBUTING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO MOTORS FOR OPERATING ELEVATORS DRIVING MACHINERY ETC AND THESE WHILE USING A LOWER SAFER POTENTIAL WERE PROPORTIONATELY LARGER
THE LATTER POINT OF ADVANTAGE IS THE ONE THAT APPEALS MOST TO THE AUTOMOBILIST AS HE IS THUS ENABLED TO TRAVEL IT IS ASSERTED MORE THAN THREE TIMES FARTHER THAN EVER BEFORE ON A SINGLE CHARGE OF THE BATTERY
FROM TIME TO TIME FURTHER SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE SOME IN PATENTS AND OTHERS IN PHOTOGRAPHIC AND SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS ALL DEALING WITH THE FASCINATING THOUGHT OF PRESERVING AND REPRESENTING ACTUAL SCENES AND EVENTS
IN APRIL OF THAT YEAR HOWEVER EDISON TOOK UP THE STUDY OF THE SUBJECT AND FILED TWO APPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS
BUT SUBSEQUENT COMMERCIAL RESULTS HAVE JUSTIFIED HIS JUDGMENT AND IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO PREDICT THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY THE BUSINESS WILL ASSUME GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS WITHIN A VERY FEW YEARS
AS THIS WAS JUST WHAT I COULD DO I NATURALLY CONCEIVED A GREAT PRIDE IN HAVING SUCH A MAN IN CHARGE OF MY WORK
THE SERIOUS AND IMPORTANT PART OF THE MAIL SOME PERSONAL AND SOME BUSINESS OCCUPIES THE ATTENTION OF SEVERAL MEN
IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO DEVOTE SPACE TO THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ENTERPRISE ALTHOUGH THEY ARE FULL OF INTEREST
AFTER OUR WORKS AT GOERCK STREET GOT TOO SMALL WE HAD LABOR TROUBLES ALSO
MOREOVER THE BLAZE COULD NOT BE EXTINGUISHED
IN THE FOLLOWING APPENDIX WE HAVE THEREFORE ENDEAVORED TO PRESENT A FEW BRIEF STATEMENTS REGARDING MR EDISON'S PRINCIPAL INVENTIONS CLASSIFIED AS TO SUBJECT-MATTER AND EXPLAINED IN LANGUAGE AS FREE FROM TECHNICALITIES AS IS POSSIBLE
THIS DISCOVERY IS ESPECIALLY APPLICABLE TO TELEGRAPHING ACROSS BODIES OF WATER THUS AVOIDING THE USE OF SUBMARINE CABLES OR FOR COMMUNICATING BETWEEN VESSELS AT SEA OR BETWEEN VESSELS AT SEA AND POINTS ON LAND BUT IT IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DISTANT POINTS ON LAND IT BEING NECESSARY HOWEVER ON LAND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF COMMUNICATION OVER OPEN PRAIRIE TO INCREASE THE ELEVATION IN ORDER TO REDUCE TO THE MINIMUM THE INDUCTION-ABSORBING EFFECT OF HOUSES TREES AND ELEVATIONS IN THE LAND ITSELF

AND THIS CHOICE WAS ADMIRABLY MADE IN ONE INSTANCE WHEN A NEW GATEMAN NOT YET THOROUGHLY INITIATED REFUSED ADMITTANCE TO EDISON HIMSELF
BEFORE LEAVING THIS PERIOD OF HIS CAREER IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT IT GAVE EDISON MANY FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITIES
BY THIS METHOD EACH PAIR OF LAMPS TAKES TOGETHER ONLY THE SAME QUANTITY OR VOLUME OF CURRENT REQUIRED BY A SINGLE LAMP IN A SIMPLE MULTIPLE-ARC SYSTEM
SOME OF THE LABORATORY ASSISTANTS COULD BE SEEN NOW AND THEN SLEEPING ON A TABLE IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS
THUS IN ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS THERE HAD BEEN PIECED INTO THE NATIONAL DOMAIN FOR QUICK DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLOITATION A REGION AS LARGE AS THE ENTIRE UNION OF THIRTEEN STATES AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE
WE INTERVIEWED THE BAD MAN THROUGH BARS AS BIG AS RAILROAD RAILS
HE WAS A FAVORITE AMONG THE EDISON OLDTIMERS AND HIS MEMORY IS STILL CHERISHED FOR WHEN SOME OF THE BOYS HAPPEN TO GET TOGETHER AS THEY OCCASIONALLY DO SOME ONE IS ALMOST SURE TO WONDER WHAT BECAME OF POOR MAC HE WAS LAST SEEN AT MOUQUIN'S FAMOUS OLD FRENCH RESTAURANT ON FULTON STREET NEW YORK WHERE HE LUNCHED WITH ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THIS BOOK AND THE LATE LUTHER STIERINGER
I NEVER SLEPT MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE HOURS SO THAT I WOULD AWAKE AT NINE OR TEN AND READ THESE PAPERS UNTIL DINNER-TIME
I TOLD HIM THE EXPENSE OF SUCH A TRIP COULD NOT BE DETERMINED BEFOREHAND IN DETAIL BUT THAT I HAD ESTABLISHED SOMEWHAT OF A REPUTATION FOR ECONOMIC TRAVEL AND THAT I DID NOT BELIEVE ANY TRAVELLER COULD SURPASS ME IN THAT RESPECT
AFTER THE FRICTION HAS BEEN DEDUCTED COMMERCIAL POSSIBILITIES COULD NOT EXIST IN THE FACE OF SUCH LOW ECONOMY AS THIS AND MR EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO IMPROVE THE DYNAMO HIMSELF IF HE WANTED A BETTER MACHINE
THE REGULAR PRESS OPERATOR WOULD GO TO THE THEATRE OR TAKE A NAP ONLY FINISHING THE REPORT AFTER 1 A.M
EBENEZER ELLIOTT OF SCOTCH DESCENT
I DO NOT THINK I HAD ANY UNDERSTANDING WITH EDISON WHEN I FIRST WENT WITH HIM AS TO MY DUTIES
OTHERS WERE COMPELLED TO TAKE OUT ROYALTY LICENSES
BUT SUCH JESTS ARE NOT GOOD

THE POLITICAL SENTIMENTS THAT THE EXPOSITION CELEBRATED WERE NOT SUCH AS TO FIND GENERAL SYMPATHY IN MONARCHICAL EUROPE SO THAT THE CROWNED HEADS WERE CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR ABSENCE
HE HAD A HEAD OF ABNORMAL SIZE WITH HIGHLY INTELLECTUAL FEATURES AND A VERY SMALL AND EMACIATED BODY
IT STARTED AS WE HAVE SAID ON SEPTEMBER 4 1882 SUPPLYING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED LIGHTS TO A COMPARATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS

THE OFFICE WAS IN THIS BUILDING AT FIRST UNTIL REMOVED TO THE BRICK LIBRARY WHEN THAT WAS FINISHED
THE CURRENT FOR THE LAST LAMP MUST PASS THROUGH THE FIRST AND ALL THE INTERMEDIATE LAMPS
BUT IF TRUE IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THE DISCOVERY IN QUESTION COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED MATERIALLY TO THE ULTIMATE ACCOMPLISHMENT
HE HAD NEITHER SOUGHT NOR EXPECTED THE MEDAL
ON THE SECOND DAY WE NOTICED A TERRIBLE SMELL IN THE SHOP AS IF FROM SOME DEAD ANIMAL
THE SPACE BETWEEN THESE TWO ROLLS ALLOWED PIECES OF ROCK MEASURING LESS THAN FOURTEEN INCHES TO DESCEND TO OTHER SMALLER ROLLS PLACED BELOW
IT WAS LYNCH LAW OF A KIND
THE REASON GIVEN FOR NOT INTRODUCING IT BEFORE THE HEARING IS UNSATISFACTORY
ON COMING TO CONSIDER THE SUBJECT NOW UNDER DISCUSSION HOWEVER WE FIND OURSELVES AT THIS WRITING ON THE THRESHOLD OF AN ENTIRELY NEW AND UNDEVELOPED ART OF SUCH BOUNDLESS POSSIBILITIES THAT ITS ULTIMATE EXTENT CAN ONLY BE A MATTER OF CONJECTURE
EQUAL ACTIVITY WAS SHOWN IN AMERICA AND BALTIMORE BEGAN THE PRACTICE OF GAS LIGHTING IN 1816
BUT OUT AT MENLO PARK THERE WAS THE FIRST ACTUAL ELECTRIC-LIGHTING CENTRAL STATION SUPPLYING DISTRIBUTED INCANDESCENT LAMPS AND SOME ELECTRIC MOTORS BY MEANS OF UNDERGROUND CONDUCTORS IMBEDDED IN ASPHALTUM AND SURROUNDED BY A WOODEN BOX
IN ORDER TO MAKE THE EXPLANATION COMPLETE THERE IS PRESENTED ANOTHER DIAGRAM SHOWING A THREE-WIRE SYSTEM UNBALANCED
COFFIN HAS BECOME ONE OF THE GREATEST MANUFACTURING INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WITH AN OUTPUT OF APPARATUS REACHING TOWARD $75,000,000 ANNUALLY
ALL THIS STUDY OF SOUND TRANSMISSION OVER LONG DISTANCES WITHOUT WIRES LED UP TO THE CONSIDERATION AND INVENTION OF PIONEER APPARATUS FOR WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY--BUT THAT ALSO IS ANOTHER CHAPTER
ADAMS I HAVE GOT SO MUCH TO DO AND LIFE IS SO SHORT I AM GOING TO HUSTLE AND THEREUPON HE STARTED ON A RUN FOR BREAKFAST
IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT THIS COLLECTION INCLUDES THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED OR MORE FLUORESCENT SALTS MADE BY EDISON DURING HIS EXPERIMENTAL SEARCH FOR THE BEST MATERIAL FOR A FLUOROSCOPE IN THE INITIAL X-RAY PERIOD
THE POINTS WERE IRON AND WE FOUND THE SPARKS WERE VERY IRREGULAR
THEN I WOULD GO TO NEW YORK AND GET AN ADVANCE OR PAY THE NOTE IF I HAD THE MONEY
AND GREATER ECONOMY IN MINING
AND THEREFORE PLANNED TO USE DYNAMITE MERELY TO DISLODGE GREAT MASSES OF ROCK AND DEPENDED UPON THE STEAM-SHOVEL OPERATED BY COAL UNDER THE BOILER TO DISPLACE HANDLE AND REMOVE THE ROCK IN DETAIL
BUT AS ITS QUOTATIONS CHANGED FROM INSTANT TO INSTANT IT WAS IN A MOST LITERAL SENSE THE CYNOSURE OF NEIGHBORING EYES ONE INDICATOR LOOKED UPON THE GOLD ROOM
HE SAID HE STOOD IT EASILY BECAUSE HE WAS INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING AND WAS READING AND STUDYING ALL THE TIME
I THOUGHT THAT BY GOING DOWN ON A SLUM STREET NEAR THE WATER-FRONT I WOULD GET SOME PRETTY CHEAP PROPERTY
JULY 9 1892 485,841 MECHANICALLY SEPARATING ORES JULY 9 1892 513,096 METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR MIXING MATERIALS
THE INSTALLATION OF BOILERS ENGINES DYNAMOS WIRING SWITCHES FIXTURES THREE STAGE REGULATORS AND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY LAMPS WAS COMPLETED IN ELEVEN DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF THE ORDER AND THE PLANT WAS SUCCESSFULLY OPERATED AT THE OPENING OF THE THEATRE ON DECEMBER 12 1882

AT THIS TIME WET PLATES OF VERY GREAT RAPIDITY WERE KNOWN AND BY ARRANGING A SERIES OF CAMERAS ALONG THE LINE OF A TRACK AND CAUSING THE HORSE IN TROTTING PAST THEM BY STRIKING WIRES OR STRINGS ATTACHED TO THE SHUTTERS TO ACTUATE THE CAMERAS AT THE RIGHT INSTANT A SERIES OF VERY CLEAR INSTANTANEOUS PHOTOGRAPHS WAS OBTAINED
AND AT ONE TIME THAT PORT WAS ACCOUNTED THE RICHEST CITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN PROPORTION TO ITS POPULATION
AS THIS CAUSES A LOUD REPETITION OF THE ORIGINAL SIGNALS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT RELAYING IS AN ECONOMIC METHOD OF EXTENDING A TELEGRAPH CIRCUIT BEYOND THE NATURAL LIMITS OF ITS BATTERY POWER
ALL WERE CONNECTED WITH WIRES
ONE DAY THIS DRIER GOT BLOCKED AND THE ORE WOULD NOT RUN DOWN
THERE IS USUALLY LITTLE THAT SAVORS OF HUMOR IN THE ORDINARY CONDUCT OF A CASE OF THIS KIND BUT IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE A PERTINENT STORY WAS RELATED BY MR LOWREY AND IT IS NOW REPRODUCED
SOON THE CANUCK BOYS ATTACKED THE YANKEE BOYS AND WE WERE ALL BADLY LICKED
BUT ON NEARLY IF NOT ALL OTHER INSTRUMENTS WILL BE FOUND IN USE THE STOCK TICKER HAS ENJOYED THE DEVOTION OF MANY BRILLIANT INVENTORS--G
13 1902 723,450 REVERSIBLE GALVANIC BATTERY
THE OPERATOR HAD WORKED SO MECHANICALLY THAT HE HAD HANDLED THE NEWS WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST KNOWLEDGE OF ITS SIGNIFICANCE MR ADAMS SAYS THAT AT THE TIME THE CITY WAS EN FETE ON ACCOUNT OF THE CLOSE OF THE WAR THE NAME OF THE ASSASSIN WAS RECEIVED BY TELEGRAPH AND IT WAS NOTED WITH A THRILL OF HORROR THAT IT WAS THAT OF A BROTHER OF EDWIN BOOTH AND OF JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH--THE LATTER OF WHOM WAS THEN PLAYING AT THE OLD NATIONAL THEATRE
ANILINE OIL 1 LB
EQUALLY MOMENTOUS WERE THE TIMES IN EUROPE WHERE THE ATTEMPT TO SECURE OPPORTUNITIES OF EXPANSION AS WELL AS LARGER LIBERTY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TOOK QUITE DIFFERENT FORM
THE ROLLS WERE SET FACE TO FACE FOURTEEN INCHES APART IN A HEAVY FRAME AND THE TOTAL WEIGHT WAS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TONS OF WHICH SEVENTY TONS WERE IN MOVING PARTS
IF FOR INSTANCE HE WERE ASKED TO FIND THE MOST PERFECT PEBBLE ON THE ATLANTIC SHORE OF NEW JERSEY INSTEAD OF HUNTING HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE FOR THE DESIRED OBJECT WE WOULD NO DOUBT FIND HIM PATIENTLY SCREENING THE ENTIRE BEACH SIFTING OUT THE MOST PERFECT STONES AND EVENTUALLY BY GRADUAL EXCLUSION REACHING THE LONG-SOUGHT-FOR PEBBLE
AND THE LATTER WAS A VETERAN OF THE CIVIL WAR WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE OF FOREST AND FIELD ACQUIRED AS A SPORTSMAN
MY TRAVELLING COMPANION WAS LESS SUCCESSFUL ON ACCOUNT OF HIS RECORD THEY HAD A LIMIT EVEN IN THOSE DAYS WHEN THE TELEGRAPH SERVICE WAS SO DEMORALIZED SOME REMINISCENCES OF MR EDISON ARE OF INTEREST AS BEARING NOT ONLY UPON THE DEMORALIZED TELEGRAPH SERVICE BUT THE CONDITIONS FROM WHICH THE NEW SOUTH HAD TO EMERGE WHILE WORKING OUT ITS SALVATION
IT IS WORTHY OF NOTE THAT NO REFERENCES WHATEVER WERE CITED AGAINST THE APPLICATION WHILE UNDER EXAMINATION IN THE PATENT OFFICE
I ASKED THE REASON WHY
WHATEVER HE DID AND WORKED ON WAS EXECUTED IN A PURE MATHEMATICAL MANNER AND ANY WRANGLER AT OXFORD WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM JUGGLE WITH INTEGRAL AND DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS WITH A DEXTERITY THAT WAS SURPRISING
AS A USUAL THING IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY FOR THEM TO BOARD A TRAIN AND TELL THE CONDUCTOR THEY WERE OPERATORS
HENCE IRON AND STEEL WERE ENTIRELY ELIMINATED IN ITS CONSTRUCTION COPPER BEING USED FOR FIXTURES FOR STEAM AND WATER PIPING AND INDEED FOR ALL OTHER PURPOSES WHERE METAL WAS EMPLOYED
HERE EDISON AND A FEW OF HIS ASSISTANTS FROM MENLO PARK INSTALLED IMMEDIATELY IN THE BASEMENT A SMALL GENERATING PLANT AT FIRST WITH A GAS-ENGINE WHICH WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL AND THEN WITH A HAMPSON HIGH-SPEED ENGINE AND BOILER CONSTITUTING A COMPLETE ISOLATED PLANT
PRENTICE WOULD POUR OUT HALF A GLASS OF WHAT THEY CALL CORN WHISKEY AND WOULD DIP THE CRACKERS IN IT AND EAT THEM
ASSUMING FOR INSTANCE THAT IT IS DESIRED TO SEND OUT THE LETTERS AM TO THE PRINTER LET US SUPPOSE THAT THE PIN CORRESPONDING TO THE LETTER A IS AT ONE END OF THE CYLINDER AND NEAR THE UPPER PART OF ITS PERIPHERY AND THAT THE LETTER M IS ABOUT THE CENTRE OF THE CYLINDER AND NEAR THE LOWER PART OF ITS PERIPHERY
THIS WOULD EFFECTIVELY PROTECT THE FIRE-BRICK LINING FROM THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF THE HEAT
THE ATTITUDE OF THE COURTS IS WELL REPRESENTED IN THE OPINION OF JUDGE COLT RENDERED IN A MOTION FOR INJUNCTION AGAINST THE BEACON VACUUM PUMP AND ELECTRICAL COMPANY
THESE PARTIES NOW MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE STOCKHOLDERS OR OWNERS OF THE GRANT AND WITH ME TO WORK THE DEPOSITS BY MY PROCESS
I OPENED THE PACKAGE SET UP THE MACHINE AND RECITED MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB ETC
ON THE MORNING OF BLACK FRIDAY THE INDICATOR WAS QUOTING 150 PREMIUM WHEREAS THE BIDS BY GOULD'S AGENTS IN THE GOLD ROOM WERE 165 FOR FIVE MILLIONS OR ANY PART
AFTER THE INVENTION OF THE VOLTAIC BATTERY EARLY IN THE LAST CENTURY EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE WHICH DETERMINED THAT HEAT COULD BE PRODUCED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT THROUGH WIRES OF PLATINUM AND OTHER METALS AND THROUGH PIECES OF CARBON AS NOTED ALREADY AND IT WAS OF COURSE ALSO OBSERVED THAT IF SUFFICIENT CURRENT WERE PASSED THROUGH THESE CONDUCTORS THEY COULD BE BROUGHT FROM THE LOWER STAGE OF REDNESS UP TO THE BRILLIANT WHITE HEAT OF INCANDESCENCE
ALL OF THESE WILL BE SEEN IN THE DIAGRAM FIG
UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE MEANS OF HOUSE AND STREET ILLUMINATION WERE OF TWO GENERIC KINDS--GREASE AND OIL
I HAD DRAWN SEVERAL LOADS OF SAND TO THIS POINT TO JUMP ON AND HAD BECOME QUITE EXPERT
I DECIDED THAT IF I FOUND A CORRESPONDING CROWD THERE THE ONLY THING TO DO TO CORRECT MY LACK OF JUDGMENT IN NOT GETTING MORE PAPERS WAS TO RAISE THE PRICE FROM FIVE CENTS TO TEN
THE TEMPTATION IS STRONG TO SAY THAT WORKADAY ELECTRICITY IS HALF AN AMERICAN
THE FIRST IMPRESSION RECEIVED AS ONE ENTERS ON THE MAIN FLOOR OF THE LIBRARY AND LOOKS AROUND IS THAT OF NOBLE PROPORTIONS AND SYMMETRY AS A WHOLE
BUT THE VERY SUCCESS OF THIS DEVICE BROUGHT COMPETITION AND IMPROVEMENT
BUT I LOSE TO-DAY THE TRY EVERYTHING SPIRIT OF EDISON'S METHOD IS WELL ILLUSTRATED IN THIS EARLY PERIOD BY A SERIES OF ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED RESISTANCE TESTS OF VARIOUS ORES MINERALS EARTHS ETC OCCUPYING OVER FIFTY PAGES OF ONE OF THE NOTE-BOOKS RELATING TO THE METALLIC FILAMENT FOR HIS LAMPS
IN THE SIXTY-FOOT KILN THE LENGTH OF THE COMBUSTION ZONE WAS ABOUT TEN FEET EXTENDING FROM A POINT SIX OR EIGHT FEET FROM THE LOWER OR DISCHARGE END TO A POINT ABOUT EIGHTEEN FEET FROM THAT END
13 1902 852,424 SECONDARY BATTERIES
MARCH 10 1879 227.679 PHONOGRAPH MARCH 19 1879 221,957 TELEPHONE
BY REASON OF THESE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS AND LOSSES IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE IN PRACTICE TO OBTAIN ONLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BARRELS OF CLINKER PER DAY OF TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
BUT LOST THE PLACE WHERE HE FOUND IT SO HE MIGHT AS WELL NEVER HAVE FOUND IT AT ALL HEREAT I WAS ENJOINED TO PROCEED FORTHWITH TO COURT THE BOARD OF EDUCATION FOR A LEAVE OF ABSENCE WHICH I DID SUCCESSFULLY THE BOARD CONSIDERING THAT A CALL SO IMPORTANT AND HONORARY WAS ENTITLED TO THEIR UNQUALIFIED FAVOR WHICH THEY GENEROUSLY GRANTED
HE TURNED THIS QUESTION OVER IN HIS MIND FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT A HOUSE CAST IN ONE PIECE WOULD BE THE ANSWER
CONVENIENTLY PLACED WITH REFERENCE TO THE END OF THE LEVER IS A BENT METALLIC PIECE P HAVING A CONTACT SCREW IN ITS UPPER HORIZONTAL ARM AND ATTACHED TO THE LOWER END OF THIS BENT PIECE IS A POST OR STANDARD TO WHICH THE MAIN BATTERY IS ELECTRICALLY CONNECTED
SOUND-BRIDGE FOR MEASURING RESISTANCE OF TUBES AND OTHER MATERIALS FOR CONVEYING SOUND
BUT IT WILL BE ADMITTED THAT IN EDISON ONE DEALS WITH A CENTRAL FIGURE OF THE GREAT AGE THAT SAW THE INVENTION AND INTRODUCTION IN PRACTICAL FORM OF THE TELEGRAPH THE SUBMARINE CABLE THE TELEPHONE THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY THE ELECTRIC TROLLEY-CAR THE STORAGE BATTERY THE ELECTRIC MOTOR THE PHONOGRAPH THE WIRELESS TELEGRAPH
MR EDISON TURNED TO HIM QUICKLY AND SAID
MR JOHN W
BEFORE IT COULD GET OUT THE OTHER WHEEL DROPPED INTO THE HOLE AT THE APEX OF THE TRIANGLE THUS CONTINUING THE CONNECTION WHICH WAS STILL FURTHER PROLONGED BY THE FIRST WHEEL DROPPING INTO THE THIRD HOLE
SEVERAL INSTRUMENTS WERE PROVIDED AND EVERY DAY ALL DAY LONG WHILE THE EXPOSITION LASTED QUEUES OF EAGER VISITORS FROM EVERY QUARTER OF THE GLOBE WERE WAITING TO HEAR THE LITTLE MACHINE TALK AND SING AND REPRODUCE THEIR OWN VOICES
ALSO THEATRICAL WEEKLIES AS WELL AS THE PROCEEDINGS AND TRANSACTIONS OF VARIOUS LEARNED AND TECHNICAL SOCIETIES
THE ONLY PATENT RIGHTS REMAINING TO THE RAILWAY COMPANY WERE THOSE UNDER THREE FIELD PATENTS ONE OF WHICH WITH CONTROLLING CLAIMS WAS PUT IN SUIT JUNE 1890 AGAINST THE JAMAICA BROOKLYN ROAD COMPANY A CUSTOMER OF THE EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY
THE FEED TOOK PLACE BETWEEN TWO COPPER ROLLS
I AM INTERESTED IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE ARTS AND MANUFACTURE
THESE WERE SUCH A BOTHER ON MY TABLE THAT I PASTED TWO STRIPS OF TINFOIL ON THE WALL AT MY DESK CONNECTING ONE PIECE TO THE POSITIVE POLE OF THE BIG BATTERY SUPPLYING CURRENT TO THE WIRES AND THE NEGATIVE POLE TO THE OTHER STRIP
HE WAS ALSO GREAT IN IMITATING THE TIN-FOIL PHONOGRAPH
I HAVE SPILT LOTS OF IT AND WHILE I HAVE ALWAYS FELT IT FOR A FEW DAYS IT IS QUICKLY FORGOTTEN AND I TURN AGAIN TO THE FUTURE DURING ANOTHER TALK ON KINDRED AFFAIRS IT WAS SUGGESTED TO EDISON THAT AS HE HAD WORKED SO HARD ALL HIS LIFE IT WAS ABOUT TIME FOR HIM TO THINK SOMEWHAT OF THE PLEASURES OF TRAVEL AND THE SOCIAL SIDE OF LIFE
WORKING ALL NIGHT IS SELDOM NECESSARY OR UNTIL TWO OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING YET EVEN NOW HE PERSISTS IN SUCH TESTS UPON HIS STRENGTH
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF GENIUS IT IS SAID THAT EDISON REPLIED RATHER INCOHERENTLY AND CHANGED THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION
IT DEPENDS FOR ITS ACTION UPON THE HEATING EFFECT OF THE CURRENT WHICH CAUSES A FINE PLATINUM-IRIDIUM WIRE ENCLOSED IN A GLASS TUBE TO EXPAND
DURING THE COURSE OF A GEOLOGICAL SURVEY WHICH HE HAD MADE FOR THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT MR BRAUNER HAD EXAMINED CLOSELY THE VARIOUS SPECIES OF PALMS WHICH GROW PLENTIFULLY IN THAT COUNTRY AND OF THEM THERE WAS ONE WHOSE FIBRES HE THOUGHT WOULD BE JUST WHAT EDISON WANTED
THE SECOND SENTRY THINKING IT WAS THE TERMINAL SENTRY WHO SHOUTED REPEATED IT TO THE THIRD AND SO ON
ABOUT SIXTY MEN WERE SIFTED TO GET TWENTY
CLARKE WHO WAS BROUGHT IN FROM THE MENLO PARK LABORATORY TO ASSUME CHARGE OF THE ENGINEERING PART OF THE COMPANY'S AFFAIRS
TO PRODUCE THE ORIGINALS FROM WHICH THESE EDISON FILMS ARE MADE THERE HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TWO STUDIOS THE LARGEST OF WHICH IS IN THE BRONX NEW YORK CITY
IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS ALL IN FURS
NO ONE EVER SAW EDISON IN A HURRY

IT BLEW EVERY WINDOW OUT OF THE PLACE ALWAYS A SHREWD OBSERVANT AND KINDLY CRITIC OF CHARACTER EDISON TELLS MANY ANECDOTES OF THE MEN WHO GATHERED AROUND HIM IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES AT THAT QUIET CORNER OF NEW JERSEY--MENLO PARK--AND LATER AT ORANGE IN THE LLEWELLYN PARK LABORATORY

DEAR KRUESI,--THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOUR PRESENT COMPOUND
AS IN PRACTICE THE PICTURES ARE TAKEN AT A RATE OF TWENTY OR MORE PER SECOND IT WILL BE QUITE OBVIOUS THAT EACH PERIOD OF REST IS INFINITESIMALLY BRIEF BEING GENERALLY ONE-THIRTIETH OF A SECOND OR LESS
NOTE HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE OF THE FIRST EDISON PLANTS AFLOAT ON THE JEANNETTE AND COLUMBIA AND THE FIRST COMMERCIAL PLANT IN THE NEW YORK LITHOGRAPHIC ESTABLISHMENT
A PULLEY AND BELT CONNECTED TO A CIRCULAR SAW LARGER THAN THE MOTOR PERMITTED LARGE LOGS OF OAK TIMBER TO BE SAWED WITH EASE WITH THE USE OF TWO SMALL CELLS OF BATTERY
A TOP VIEW OF THE ROLLS IS SHOWN IN THE SKETCH ONE ROLL AND ONE OF ITS BEARINGS BEING SHOWN IN SECTION
BASING THE STATEMENTS UPON FACTS SHOWN BY THE CENSUS REPORTS OF 1902 AND 1907 AND ADDING THERETO THE GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRY SINCE THAT TIME WE FIND ON A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE THAT AT THIS WRITING THE INVESTMENT HAS BEEN NOT LESS THAN $800,000,000 IN NOW EXISTING TELEPHONE SYSTEMS WHILE NO FEWER THAN 10,500,000,000 TALKS WENT OVER THE LINES DURING THE YEAR 1908
THE OPERATION OF SHIFTING THE TYPE-WHEELS WILL BE GIVEN FURTHER ON
THE FIRST PUBLISHED ACCOUNT OF THE MODERN SPEAKING TELEPHONE WAS A PAPER READ BY BELL BEFORE THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES IN BOSTON IN MAY OF THAT YEAR
SPEAKING OF THIS SPECIAL ORDEAL FOR WHICH HE HAD THUS BEEN UNCONSCIOUSLY PREPARING EDISON SAYS
EVERY CONCEIVABLE PHASE OF INGENUITY THAT COULD BE DEVISED BY TECHNICAL EXPERTS WAS EXERCISED IN THE ATTEMPT TO SHOW THAT EDISON HAD ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING NEW
25 1907 941,630 PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR ARTIFICIALLY AGING OR SEASONING PORTLAND CEMENT FEB
WE KEPT MINUTE RECORDS OF THESE INDICATIONS AND WHEN THE SURVEY WAS FINISHED WE HAD EXACT INFORMATION OF THE DEPOSITS IN EVERY PART OF EACH STATE WE HAD PASSED THROUGH
I REMEMBER SEEING HIM OFF ON THE TRAIN NEVER EXPECTING TO SEE HIM AGAIN
ONLY THE TIME WAS NOT RIPE
THE GREATLY INCREASED CAPACITY IN PROPORTION TO WEIGHT OF THE EDISON CELL MAKES IT PARTICULARLY ADAPTABLE FOR THIS CLASS OF WORK ON ACCOUNT OF THE MUCH GREATER RADIUS OF TRAVEL THAT IS POSSIBLE BY ITS USE
BUT IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE SEEN RUFUS BULLOCK BECOME GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA AND EZRA CORNELL GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK
CONNECTION WITH THE TELEPHONE SO AS TO MAKE THAT INSTRUMENT AN AUXILIARY IN THE TRANSMISSION OF PERMANENT AND INVALUABLE RECORDS INSTEAD OF BEING THE RECIPIENT OF MOMENTARY AND FLEETING COMMUNICATION OF THE ABOVE FIELDS OF USEFULNESS IN WHICH IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE PHONOGRAPH MIGHT BE APPLIED ONLY THREE HAVE BEEN COMMERCIALLY REALIZED--NAMELY THE REPRODUCTION OF MUSICAL INCLUDING VAUDEVILLE OR TALKING SELECTIONS FOR WHICH PURPOSE A VERY LARGE PROPORTION OF THE PHONOGRAPHS NOW MADE IS USED
THE HARD RUBBER HE USED WAS OF COURSE FULL OF SULPHUR AND THIS BEING ATTACKED BY THE NASCENT HYDROGEN HAD PRODUCED SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN GAS IN TORRENTS DISPLACING ALL OF THE AIR IN THE ROOM
THE SMALLER THE CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA THE GREATER THE PERCENTAGE OF DROP
THOMPSON DESCRIBES HIM AS LYING ILL IN BED WITH A WOUNDED LEG AND WATCHING RESULTS WITH AN INCANDESCENT LAMP FASTENED TO HIS BED CURTAIN BY A SAFETY-PIN AND LIT UP BY CURRENT FROM THE LITTLE FAURE CELL
THE INVENTOR CREATES A NEW THING--AN INVENTION OF UTILITY--AND THE PEOPLE REPRESENTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAY TO HIM IN EFFECT
THE INSTRUMENTS IN THE HANDSOME NEW OFFICES WERE FASTENED IN THEIR PROPER PLACES AND OPERATORS WERE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN TO REMOVE THEM OR TO USE THE BATTERIES EXCEPT ON REGULAR WORK
THE FAIRY PRINCE COMMANDS THE PRINCESS TO APPEAR CONSIGNS THE BAD BROTHERS TO INSTANT ANNIHILATION TURNS THE WITCH INTO A CAT CONFERS LIFE ON INANIMATE THINGS
THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT FROM HIM REFERS TO A TYPE OF AEROPLANE OF GREAT NOVELTY AND INGENUITY
AND SAID I WAS NOW GOING OVER TO THE ENEMY
THE HIGH-RESISTANCE SECONDARY CIRCUIT OF AN INDUCTION COIL IS LOCATED IN CIRCUIT BETWEEN THE CONDENSING SURFACE AND THE GROUND
BUT NO ONE TOLD ME THIS WHILE HE WAS ENGAGED ON THESE TESTS COLONEL GOURAUD CAME DOWN ONE NIGHT TO VISIT HIM AT THE LONELY WORKS SPENT A VIGIL WITH HIM AND TOWARD MORNING WANTED COFFEE
I KNEW WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND ORDERED THEM TO RUN DOWN AND SHUT OFF
WHEN THE GALVANOMETER SHOWS THE DESIRED DEFLECTION THE NEEDLE T WILL INDICATE UPON THE DIAL IN DECIMAL FRACTIONS OF AN INCH THE EXACT DISTANCE THROUGH WHICH THE STRIP HAS BEEN MOVED
IN THIS INSTANCE WHEN THE INVENTOR WAS LARGELY HIS OWN FINANCIER THE DIFFICULTIES AND PERILS WERE REDOUBLED
THEIR EFFORTS HAD BEEN CONFINED TO LOW-RESISTANCE BURNERS OF LARGE RADIATING SURFACE FOR THEIR LAMPS BUT HE REALIZED THE UTTER FUTILITY OF SUCH DEVICES
HE HAD THE WANDERLUST AFTER ENJOYING HOSPITALITY IN BOSTON IN 1868-69 ON THE FLOOR OF MY HALL-BEDROOM WHICH WAS A PARADISE FOR THE ENTOMOLOGIST WHILE THE BOARDING-HOUSE ITSELF WAS RUN ON THE BANTING SYSTEM OF FLESH REDUCTION HE CAME TO ME ONE DAY AND SAID
THAT WHICH WAS WILD HAD BECOME DOMESTICATED
AND WE CONCLUDED IT MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD AFTER ALL AS IT WOULD GIVE US A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO CATCH UP
ONE EARLY STATION IN NEW YORK FOR ARC LIGHTING WAS AN OLD SOAP-WORKS WHOSE WELL-SOAKED FLOORS DID NOT NEED MUCH ADDITIONAL GREASE TO RENDER THEM CHOICE FUEL FOR THE INEVITABLE FLAMES
THUS IN JANUARY 1880 HIS FIRST PATENT APPLICATION FOR A SYSTEM OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION WAS SIGNED
I MET HIM SEVERAL DAYS AFTERWARD AND HE SAID HE HAD FORGIVEN MR BERGMANN AS HE WAS SUCH A SMART BUSINESS MAN AND THE SCHEME WAS SO INGENIOUS
THE OPERATION IS CONTINUOUS A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF CHALK PASSING IN AT ONE END OF THE KILN AND A CONTINUOUS DRIBBLE OF CLINKER-BALLS DROPPING OUT AT THE OTHER
EDISON HAS RESIGNED HIS SITUATION IN THE WESTERN UNION OFFICE BOSTON AND WILL DEVOTE HIS TIME TO BRINGING OUT HIS INVENTIONS OH THE SUPREME SPLENDID CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH
THE MEN GOT IN THE HABIT OF PLAGUING HIM
THERE WAS NO HEAD TO ANYTHING
WHEN THIS HIGH SPEED IS ATTAINED MASSES OF ROCK WEIGHING SEVERAL TONS IN ONE OR MORE PIECES ARE DUMPED INTO A HOPPER WHICH GUIDES THEM INTO THE GAP BETWEEN THE RAPIDLY REVOLVING ROLLS
RANDOLPH AFTERWARDS SECRETARY
WHEN THE DRAFT CAME I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND IT WAS FOR L30,000
NONE WAS MORE EARNEST OR INDEFATIGABLE THAN EDISON WHO DURING THE PROGRESS OF HIS INVESTIGATIONS TOOK OUT THIRTY-EIGHT PATENTS ON VARIOUS INVENTIONS RELATING THERETO SOME OF THEM COVERING CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE RECEIVING PAPER
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER TO MAINTAIN THE DEVICES IN ADJUSTMENT FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS SINCE THE INVENTION DEPENDED UPON THE MAKE-AND-BREAK PRINCIPLE THE CIRCUIT BEING MADE AND BROKEN EVERY TIME AN IMPULSE-CREATING SOUND WENT THROUGH IT CAUSING THE MOVEMENT OF THE DIAPHRAGM ON WHICH THE SOUND-WAVES IMPINGED
HE DISAPPEARED ONE DAY AND ALTHOUGH I SENT MEN EVERYWHERE THAT IT WAS LIKELY HE COULD BE FOUND HE WAS NOT DISCOVERED
IN THIS WAY I KEEP UP TO DATE AND LIVE IN A GREAT MOVING WORLD OF MY OWN AND WHAT'S MORE I ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT REFERRING TO SOME EVENT OF THE PAST HE SAID
THE NEXT TIME WE JUST SAVED OURSELVES
WHILE RAPID PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE IN THIS AND OTHER DIRECTIONS THE WHEELS OF INDUSTRY WERE HUMMING MERRILY AT THE EDISON TUBE WORKS FOR OVER FIFTEEN MILES OF TUBE CONDUCTORS WERE REQUIRED FOR THE DISTRICT BESIDES THE BOXES TO CONNECT THE NETWORK AT THE STREET INTERSECTIONS AND THE HUNDREDS OF JUNCTION BOXES FOR TAKING THE SERVICE CONDUCTORS INTO EACH OF THE HUNDREDS OF BUILDINGS
THIS COURSE WAS PURSUED UNTIL THE MENLO PARK PERIOD WHEN HE INSTITUTED A NEW REGIME THAT HAS BEEN CONTINUED DOWN TO THE PRESENT DAY
THE BRIEF BUT VIGOROUS WESTERN UNION COMPETITION WAS A KIND OF BLESSING IN DISGUISE
BUT THE LITTLE BATTERY WITH ITS METAL PLATES IN A WEAK SOLUTION PROVED A PERENNIAL RESERVOIR OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY SAFE AND CONTROLLABLE FROM WHICH SUPPLIES COULD BE DRAWN AT WILL
LARGE MECHANICAL MIXERS ARE USED AND AS IT IS MADE THE MIXTURE IS DUMPED INTO TANKS FROM WHICH IT IS CONVEYED TO A DISTRIBUTING TANK ON THE TOP OR ROOF OF THE FORM
THIS FACT HE UTILIZED BY THE MEANS WHICH HE HAS DESCRIBED A LAMP HAVING A FILAMENTARY CARBON BURNER IN A NEARLY PERFECT VACUUM IN A SUIT AGAINST THE BOSTON INCANDESCENT LAMP COMPANY ET AL IN THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS DECIDED IN FAVOR OF EDISON ON JUNE 11 1894 JUDGE COLT IN HIS OPINION SAID AMONG OTHER THINGS
ONE OF THE EASY EFFECTS OF DOUBLE EXPOSURE
THE FLAME WAS ABOUT FOUR FEET IN DIAMETER AND ELEVEN FEET HIGH
BRIEF REFERENCE HAS BEEN MADE TO MOTION PICTURES OF EDUCATIONAL SUBJECTS AND IN THIS FIELD THERE ARE VERY GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT
HE SECURED THE RIGHTS FOR THE EMPIRE AND ORGANIZED THE BERLIN EDISON SYSTEM NOW ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD
AND WHETHER IT WAS A SUDDEN DISCHARGE OF ORDINARY INSULATED CONDUCTORS OR OF LEYDEN JARS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OUTSIDE THE CAGE OR ELECTRIFICATION AND DISCHARGE OF THE CAGE ITSELF HE SAW NO EFFECTS ON HIS MOST DELICATE GOLD-LEAF ELECTROSCOPES IN THE INTERIOR
THE OTHER USES HOWEVER WHICH WERE EARLY PREDICTED FOR THE PHONOGRAPH HAVE NOT AS YET BEEN WORKED OUT PRACTICALLY ALTHOUGH THE TIME SEEMS NOT FAR DISTANT WHEN ITS GENERAL UTILITY WILL BE WIDELY ENLARGED
DEVICE FOR EXAMINING COMBINATIONS OF ODORS AND THEIR CHANGES BY ROTATION AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS
ONE HOT AFTERNOON--AUGUST 30TH AS SHOWN BY THE DOCUMENT IN THE CASE--MR EDISON WAS FOUND BY ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THIS BIOGRAPHY EMPLOYED MOST BUSILY IN MAKING A MYSTERIOUS SERIES OF TESTS ON PAPER USING FOR INK ACIDS THAT CORRUGATED AND BLISTERED THE PAPER WHERE WRITTEN UPON
ITS CONSTRUCTION DIFFERS BUT SLIGHTLY FROM THE ELECTRIC GENERATOR THIS WAS BUT AN EVIDENCE OF HIS EARLY APPRECIATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF ELECTRICITY AS A MOTIVE POWER
BY MEANS OF MY APPARATUS I AM ENABLED ESPECIALLY TO REPRODUCE THE PASSING OF A PROCESSION A REVIEW OF MILITARY MANOEUVRES THE MOVEMENTS OF A BATTLE A PUBLIC FETE A THEATRICAL SCENE THE EVOLUTION OR THE DANCES OF ONE OR OF SEVERAL PERSONS THE CHANGING EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE OR IF ONE DESIRES THE GRIMACES OF A HUMAN FACE
THE VARIED EXPERIENCES GAINED IN THE CONCENTRATION OF VAST QUANTITIES OF ORE LED NATURALLY TO A GREATER DEVELOPMENT AND SEVERAL NEW TYPES AND ARRANGEMENTS OF MAGNETIC SEPARATORS WERE EVOLVED AND ELABORATED BY HIM FROM FIRST TO LAST DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE WORK AT THE CONCENTRATING PLANT
I KNEW I WAS IN A HOLE
HE WAS POSSESSED OF ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE FAR BEYOND THAT OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES
IT CAN BE READILY SEEN THAT THIS SITUATION MADE IT ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE EDISON SYSTEM TO SECURE THE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY NEEDED FOR ITS EXPLOITATION AND TO OBTAIN NEW FRANCHISES OR CITY ORDINANCES AS A PUBLIC UTILITY
PERHAPS THE WORD UTILIZATION OR APPLICATION IS BETTER THAN DISCOVERY FOR THEN AS NOW AN ENDLESS WEALTH OF PHENOMENA NOTED BY EXPERIMENTERS FROM GILBERT TO FRANKLIN AND FARADAY AWAITED THE INVENTION THAT COULD ALONE RENDER THEM USEFUL TO MANKIND
SO WHEN THE MEN WENT OUT THEY APPOINTED A COMMITTEE TO MEET US
28 1891 472,753 ORE-SCREENING APPARATUS
IT IS NO WONDER THAT THIS CLEVER LITTLE SHEET RECEIVED THE APPROVAL AND PATRONAGE OF THE ENGLISH ENGINEER STEPHENSON WHEN INSPECTING THE GRAND TRUNK SYSTEM AND WAS NOTED BY NO LESS DISTINGUISHED A CONTEMPORARY THAN THE LONDON TIMES AS THE FIRST NEWSPAPER IN THE WORLD TO BE PRINTED ON A TRAIN IN MOTION

HENCE AS THE ARMATURE IS ALTERNATELY ATTRACTED WHEN CURRENT PASSES AROUND ITS ELECTROMAGNET AND DRAWN UP BY THE SPRING ON CESSATION OF CURRENT IT MOVES UP AND DOWN THUS ACTUATING THE ESCAPEMENT AND CAUSING A ROTATION OF THE TOOTHED WHEEL IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ARROW
RETURNING TO THE AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT SO LONG AS EDISON WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IT AS A SUPERVISING PROVIDENCE IT DID SPLENDID WORK WHICH RENDERS THE LATER NEGLECT OF AUTOMATIC OR RAPID TELEGRAPHY THE MORE REMARKABLE
TO REDUCE IT TO CONCRETE DATA AND IN REDUCING TO UNFOLD ITS COLOSSAL DIMENSIONS

SOME HAD POURED WATER ON IT AND OTHERS SAID
AFTER WE RETIRED AND WERE ASLEEP A THUNDERING KNOCK ON THE DOOR AWAKENED US
WHATEVER ITS DEMERITS THIS SYSTEM ENABLED THE ATLANTIC PACIFIC COMPANY TO HANDLE A MUCH LARGER BUSINESS DURING 1875 AND 1876 THAN IT COULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE WITH ITS LIMITED NUMBER OF WIRES IN THEIR THEN CONDITION MR REID ALSO NOTES AS A VERY THOROUGH TEST OF THE PERFECT PRACTICABILITY OF THE SYSTEM THAT IT HANDLED THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE DECEMBER 3 1876 OF 12,600 WORDS WITH COMPLETE SUCCESS
SOMEWHAT ALLIED TO THIS CURIOUS FACULTY IS ANOTHER NO LESS REMARKABLE AND THAT IS THE ABILITY TO POINT OUT INSTANTLY AN ERROR IN A MASS OF REPORTED EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

I BOUGHT WHOLESALE AND AT A LOW PRICE AND PERMITTED THE WIVES OF THE ENGINEERS AND TRAINMEN TO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE DISCOUNT
PARAFFINED PAPER APPEARS ALSO TO HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTED WITH AS AN IMPRESSIBLE MATERIAL
THEN HIS FACE LIGHTED UP AND HE SAID
THE THIRD YEAR I SUCCEEDED IN GETTING UP MACHINERY AND IN CHANGING THE PROCESSES UNTIL IT GOT DOWN SO THAT THEY COST SOMEWHERE AROUND FIFTY CENTS
HE WAS KEPT STRICTLY INCOMMUNICADO
BUT IT WAS WEEKS BEFORE WE COULD PREVENT IT FROM RUNNING OFF
THE SUBJECTS REGISTERED JERKILY BY THE FILMS WERE CRUDE AND AMUSING SUCH AS OF FRED OTT'S SNEEZE CARMENCITA DANCING ITALIANS AND THEIR PERFORMING BEARS FENCING TRAPEZE STUNTS HORSEMANSHIP BLACKSMITHING--JUST SIMPLE MOVEMENTS WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT TO PORTRAY THE SILENT DRAMA
THE ENORMOUS MASS OF COPPER NEEDED IN SUCH A SYSTEM CAN BE BETTER APPRECIATED BY A CONCRETE EXAMPLE
WE ARRANGED FROG'S LEGS TO PASS ETHERIC FORCE THROUGH
IT LASTED TWO DAYS OF ANOTHER VISIT EDISON SAYS
I GENERALLY HAD HALL BEDROOMS BECAUSE THEY WERE CHEAP AND I NEEDED MONEY TO BUY APPARATUS
THE WORK THAT EDISON DID WAS AS USUAL MARKED BY INFINITE VARIETY OF METHOD AS WELL AS BY THE POWER TO SEIZE ON THE ONE NEEDED ELEMENT OF PRACTICAL SUCCESS
HENCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE REVOLUTION OF THE CYLINDER MAY BE INTERRUPTED AS OFTEN AS DESIRED BY MANIPULATION OF THE VARIOUS KEYS IN TRANSMITTING THE LETTERS AND FIGURES WHICH ARE TO BE RECORDED BY THE PRINTING INSTRUMENT
THE GIANT ROLLS FOR CRUSHING INTERMEDIATE ROLLS
BERGMANN GAVE HIM A WITHERING LOOK OF SCORN AND SAID COME HERE AND I WILL SHOW YOU THROWING OFF THE BELT AND DISCONNECTING THE WIRES HE SPUN THE ARMATURE AROUND BY HAND
OR HE WILL SIT DOWN AND WRITE OUT A SERIES OF ELIMINATIONS ADDITIONS OR CHANGES TO BE WORKED OUT AND REPORTED UPON WITH SUCH VARIATIONS AS MAY SUGGEST THEMSELVES DURING THEIR PROGRESS
I SAID HE CERTAINLY COULD AND THAT THERE WAS NOBODY WHO COULD STICK HIM
IF WE CONSIDER A SIMPLE CIRCUIT IN WHICH A CURRENT IS FLOWING AND INCLUDE IN THE CIRCUIT A CARBON HORSESHOE-LIKE CONDUCTOR WHICH IT IS DESIRED TO BRING TO INCANDESCENCE BY THE HEAT GENERATED BY THE CURRENT PASSING THROUGH IT IT IS FIRST EVIDENT THAT THE RESISTANCE OFFERED TO THE CURRENT BY THE WIRES THEMSELVES MUST BE LESS THAN THAT OFFERED BY THE BURNER BECAUSE OTHERWISE CURRENT WOULD BE WASTED AS HEAT IN THE CONDUCTING WIRES
IT MAY WELL BE DOUBTED WHETHER IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF APPLIED ELECTRICITY THERE OCCUR SUCH BEAUTIFUL COMBINATIONS SO QUICKLY MADE BROKEN UP AND OTHERS REFORMED AS IN THE OPERATION OF THE EDISON QUADRUPLEX
MENLO PARK WAS THE MEREST HAMLET
ON JULY 2D OF THAT YEAR WE WERE ORDERED TO SUNBURY AND TO BE READY TO START THE STATION ON THE FOURTH
255 AND 257 PEARL STREET OCCUPYING A LOT SO BY 100 FEET
AFTER I MOVED TO MENLO PARK I WAS VERY BUSY WITH THE TELEPHONE AND PHONOGRAPH AND I PAID NO ATTENTION TO THIS LITTLE ARRANGEMENT
26 1886 466,400 CUT-OUT FOR INCANDESCENT LAMPS--EDISON AND J
AS USUAL I TOOK THE NIGHT TRICK WHICH MOST OPERATORS DISLIKED BUT WHICH I PREFERRED AS IT GAVE ME MORE LEISURE TO EXPERIMENT
SOME TWENTY YEARS LATER IT WAS INDEPENDENTLY INVENTED AND PATENTED BY ANOTHER INVENTOR
BUT IN LOWREY'S SAVOIR FAIRE READY WIT AND HUMOR CHIVALRY OF DEVOTION GRACEFUL ELOQUENCE AND ADMIRABLE EQUIPOISE OF JUDGMENT WERE ALL THE QUALITIES THAT THE OCCASION DEMANDED AND THAT MET THE EXIGENCIES
SO THESE TWO LINES OF WORK WERE TAKEN UP BY MR EDISON WITH JUST AS MUCH ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY AS IS USUAL WITH HIM THE COMMERCIAL FAILURE OF THE CONCENTRATING PLANT SEEMING NOT TO AFFECT HIS SPIRITS IN ANY WAY
OCT 29 1904 821,625 TREATING ALKALINE STORAGE BATTERIES

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO GENTLEMEN IS TO INSULATE YOUR WIRES DRAW THEM THROUGH THE CHEAPEST THING ON EARTH--IRON PIPE--RUN YOUR PIPES THROUGH CHANNELS OR GALLERIES UNDER THE STREET AND YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE THING DONE THIS WAS PRACTICALLY THE SYSTEM ADOPTED AND IN USE TO THIS DAY
THE EARLIER YEARS OF HIS INVENTIVE ACTIVITY WHILE PRODUCTIVE OF MANY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES SUCH AS STOCK TICKERS AND PRINTERS DUPLEX QUADRUPLEX AND AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHS WERE NOT MARKED BY THE TURMOIL OF INTERMINABLE LEGAL CONFLICTS THAT AROSE AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE TELEPHONE AND ELECTRIC-LIGHT EPOCHS
HOOD WRIGHT A PARTNER IN THE FIRM OF DREXEL MORGAN CO
HE ALSO CONSIDERED VARIOUS FORMS AND SHAPES FOR THE ARMATURE AND BY METHODICAL AND SYSTEMATIC RESEARCH OBTAINED THE DATA AND BEST CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HE COULD BUILD HIS GENERATOR
ONE OF THESE DID ME A MOST SERIOUS INJURY
CONVERSATION CAN BE CARRIED ON WITH THIS MEGAPHONE AT A DISTANCE OF OVER TWO MILES AS WITH A SHIP OR THE BALLOON
AND THEREFORE WHEN MR HENRY VILLARD AND HIS SYNDICATE OFFERED TO BUY US OUT WE CONCLUDED IT WAS BETTER TO BE SURE THAN BE SORRY
I HAD MY HEART TRYING TO CLIMB UP AROUND MY OESOPHAGUS
WHETHER THE COMPANY WAS A SUCCESS OR A FAILURE MATTERED NOT TO HIM
IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD SAID THIS JOURNAL THAT MR EDDISON DOES NOT BELONG TO HIMSELF
FOREMOST IN THE FIRST CATEGORY WAS MR E
WHICH IS NOW 1910 ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF THE ELECTRIC-LIGHTING INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES
IT SHOULD PERHAPS BE NOTED AT THIS POINT THAT A CURIOUS EFFECT OBSERVED AT THE LABORATORY WAS SHOWN IN CONNECTION WITH EDISON LAMPS AT THE PHILADELPHIA EXHIBITION OF 1884
HE ARGUES HIS POINT WITH GREAT VEHEMENCE POUNDS ON THE TABLE TO EMPHASIZE HIS VIEWS AND ILLUSTRATES HIS THEME WITH A WEALTH OF APT SIMILES
HE SPOKE WITH VERY GREAT ENTHUSIASM OF THE WORK BEFORE HIM--NAMELY THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS ELECTRIC-LIGHTING SYSTEM
ALL WAS EXCITEMENT
ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING WE LIT UP AND IT WAS VERY GOOD
BORN IN MASSACHUSETTS MR LOWREY IN HIS EARLIER DAYS OF STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DEFRAY SOME PORTION OF HIS EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES BY TEACHING MUSIC IN THE BERKSHIRE VILLAGES AND BY A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE ONE OF HIS PUPILS WAS F
OF COURSE IN DRY WEATHER THE LOSS OF CURRENT WAS PRACTICALLY NOTHING AND UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS EDISON HELD HIS SYSTEM WAS IN RESPECT TO LEAKAGE AND THE PROBLEMS OF ELECTROLYTIC ATTACK OF THE CURRENT ON ADJACENT PIPES ETC AS FULLY INSULATED AS THE STANDARD TROLLEY NETWORK OF THE DAY
IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH GOULD
PHELPS ANOTHER INVESTIGATOR WHO HAD BEEN EXPERIMENTING ALONG THE SAME LINES AND HAD TAKEN OUT SEVERAL PATENTS
I SAW ONE BEAUTIFUL BOY ABOUT TEN THE SON OF AN ENGLISH LORD
I DETERMINED TO TAKE UP THE SEARCH AGAIN AND CONTINUE IT
RAE C
JUST AT THAT TIME I WANTED TO TAKE UP SOMETHING NEW AND PROFESSOR BARKER SUGGESTED THAT I GO TO WORK AND SEE IF I COULD SUBDIVIDE THE ELECTRIC LIGHT SO IT COULD BE GOT IN SMALL UNITS LIKE GAS
FROM A CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTS AND WITH HIS USUAL TENDENCY TO UPSET TRADITIONAL OBSERVANCES EDISON CONCEIVED THE BOLD IDEA OF CONSTRUCTING GIGANTIC ROLLS WHICH BY THE FORCE OF MOMENTUM WOULD BE CAPABLE OF CRUSHING INDIVIDUAL ROCKS OF VASTLY GREATER SIZE THAN EVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED
THERE SAID BERGMANN YOU SEE IT'S NOT HERE THAT YOU MUST LOOK FOR YOUR LOSS THIS SATISFIED THE LANDLORD AND HE STARTED OFF TO HIS OTHER TENANTS
DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF OPERATING THE PEARL STREET STATION LIGHT WAS SUPPLIED TO CUSTOMERS WITHOUT CHARGE
ONE OF MR EDISON'S MOST VIVID RECOLLECTIONS GOES BACK TO 1850 WHEN AS A CHILD THREE OF FOUR YEARS OLD HE SAW CAMPED IN FRONT OF HIS HOME SIX COVERED WAGONS PRAIRIE SCHOONERS AND WITNESSED THEIR DEPARTURE FOR CALIFORNIA
I HAD A SHOP AT NEWARK IN WHICH I MANUFACTURED STOCK TICKERS AND SUCH THINGS
THE BEST FINE GRINDING-MACHINES THAT IT WAS THEN POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN WERE SO INEFFICIENT AS TO INVOLVE A LOSS OF 82 PER CENT
IT IS REGARDED AS POSSIBLE THAT EASTERN FURNACES WILL BE ABLE TO USE A SMALLER PROPORTION OF THE COSTLIER COKE AND CORRESPONDINGLY INCREASE IN ANTHRACITE COAL WHICH IS A CHEAPER FUEL IN THAT SECTION
IT WAS INDEED OWING TO THIS LATTER CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO HIS ASPIRATIONS NECESSITATED AN INCREASE OF REVENUE
EVERY BROKER'S OFFICE WAS BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED ALL NIGHT AND ALL HANDS WERE AT WORK
OF WORK DONE WITH ONLY 16 PER CENT
ROBERTS WAS THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR WHO WAS THE FINANCIAL BACKER TO THE EXTENT OF $100
NORMALLY A STREAM OF FINELY DIVIDED ORE FALLING FROM THE HOPPER WOULD FALL INTO THAT PORTION OF THE BIN LYING TO THE LEFT OF THE PARTITION
I ALSO HAD THE PLEASURE OF HIS GENIAL COMPANY AT THE BOARDING-HOUSE ABOUT A MILE DISTANT BUT AT THE SACRIFICE OF SOME APPARATUS
IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT EACH OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS HAS BEEN TREATED AS A WHOLE OR CLASS GENERALLY SPEAKING AND NOT AS A DIGEST OF ALL THE INDIVIDUAL PATENTS RELATING TO IT
MORE THAN TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO ONE OF THE WRITERS OF THIS NARRATIVE HEARD HIM REMARK DURING A DISCUSSION ON ANCIENT BUILDINGS
IT GOT SO BAD THAT THE MANAGER CAME TO ME AND SAID HE COULD NOT STAND IT ANY LONGER
BUT AS THE READER WILL SEE FROM THE FOLLOWING EXCERPTS EDISON DISCOVERED A HITHERTO UNKNOWN PHENOMENON--NAMELY THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THE RULE WOULD BE REVERSED AND ELECTRICITY WOULD PASS THROUGH SPACE AND THROUGH MATTER ENTIRELY UNCONNECTED WITH ITS POINT OF ORIGIN
NO RADICAL CHANGE WAS IMMEDIATELY MADE HOWEVER BUT THE PRODUCT OF THE LAMP FACTORY WAS GRADUALLY CHANGED OVER DURING THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS FROM THE USE OF BAMBOO TO THE SQUIRTED FILAMENT AS THE NEW MATERIAL WAS CALLED
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT THIS FOR IT CRUMBLES EVEN AFTER MANIPULATING IT WITH MY FINGERS HOW LONG DID YOU KNEAD IT SAID EDISON
I DON'T KNOW ANY THING ABOUT RADIUM AND I HAVE LOTS OF COMPANY THE ELECTRICAL ENGINEER OF JUNE 3 1896 CONTAINS A PHOTOGRAPH OF MR EDISON TAKEN BY THE LIGHT OF ONE OF HIS FLUORESCENT LAMPS
I HAVE A FINE SPRINGFIELD MUSKET SUPPOSE YOU TRY IT SO FOX TOOK THE MUSKET AND FIRED
SUFFICE IT TO SAY BY WAY OF REMINDER THAT IT IS FOUNDED UPON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON KNOWN AS THE PERSISTENCE OF VISION THROUGH WHICH A SERIES OF SEQUENTIAL PHOTOGRAPHIC PICTURES OF ANIMATE MOTION PROJECTED UPON A SCREEN IN RAPID SUCCESSION WILL REPRODUCE TO THE EYE ALL THE APPEARANCE OF THE ORIGINAL MOVEMENTS
THE PERFORATED TUBES INTO WHICH THE NICKEL ACTIVE MATERIAL IS LOADED ARE MADE OF NICKEL-PLATED STEEL OF HIGH QUALITY
LESS THAN A YEAR LATER MARCH 3 1883 THE INSTALLATION WAS READY AND WAS PUT IN OPERATION THE THEATRE SANTA RADEGONDA HAVING BEEN PULLED DOWN AND A NEW CENTRAL-STATION BUILDING ERECTED IN ITS PLACE--PROBABLY THE FIRST EDIFICE CONSTRUCTED IN EUROPE FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
MR ORTON WANTED ME TO TAKE HOLD OF IT AND MAKE IT COMMERCIAL
THEY WERE SENDING OLD MESSAGES
THE BOX MECHANISM IS USUALLY OF THE RATCHET STEP-BY-STEP MOVEMENT FAMILIAR IN DISTRICT MESSENGER CALL-BOXES EDISON'S CURIOUSLY PRACTICAL THOUGH IMAGINATIVE MIND DEMANDED REALITIES TO WORK UPON THINGS THAT BELONG TO HUMAN NATURE'S DAILY FOOD AND HE SOON HARKED BACK TO TELEGRAPHY A DOMAIN IN WHICH HE WAS DESTINED TO SUCCEED AND OVER WHICH HE WAS TO REIGN SUPREME AS AN INVENTOR
FOR DESCRIPTION OF FEEDER PATENT SEE APPENDIX IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT FROM THE OUTSET EDISON HAD DETERMINED UPON INSTALLING UNDERGROUND CONDUCTORS AS THE ONLY PERMANENT AND SATISFACTORY METHOD FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF CURRENT FROM CENTRAL STATIONS IN CITIES
IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE LABORATORY IS ONLY THE CORE OF A GROUP OF BUILDINGS DEVOTED TO PRODUCTION ON A HUGE SCALE BY HUNDREDS OF ARTISANS
EDISON HIMSELF BEGAN AT THAT POINT AND HIS NOTE-BOOKS SHOW THAT HE MADE VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS WITH THIS TYPE OF LAMP AT A VERY EARLY STAGE
MORE THAN THIS THEY OFFER TO THE POOR MAN AN EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE FOR THE SALOON
WHEN IT ARRIVES AT THE LOWER END THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN BURNED AND THE CLINKER DROPS OUT INTO A RECEIVING CHAMBER BELOW
FINALLY THE TAMMANY LEADER CALLED A HALT AS WE WERE RUNNING BIG ENGINE LATHES OUT ON THE SIDEWALK AND HE WAS AFRAID WE WERE CARRYING IT A LITTLE TOO FAR
EDISON'S INSTRUCTIONS ALWAYS CLEAR CUT AND DIRECT FOLLOWED BY HIS KEEN OVERSIGHT ADMIT OF NOTHING LESS THAN IMPLICIT OBSERVANCE IN ALL DETAILS NO MATTER WHERE THEY MAY LEAD AND IMPEL TO THE UTMOST MINUTENESS AND ACCURACY
NOTABLY WITH THE INCANDESCENT LAMP AND THE STORAGE BATTERY
I TOOK IT OFF AND MAKING A SKETCH WENT TO DAVE CUNNINGHAM HAVING THE FUNNEL IN MY HAND TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT I WANTED MADE
HE WAS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARILY CONCEITED MAN I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS
AS I HAD ABOUT EVERYTHING IN CHEMISTRY THAT COULD BE BOUGHT I TOLD HIM I HAD
AS INTIMATED AT THE OUTSET THE TAILINGS WILL BE 75 PER CENT
ECKERT PAST-PRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY WAS ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF WAR UNDER PRESIDENT LINCOLN
AS A YOUNG WOMAN SHE BECAME A TEACHER IN THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL AT VIENNA AND THUS MET HER HUSBAND WHO WAS RESIDING THERE
THE VARYING RESISTANCE AND THE INDUCTION-COIL
AND THE IMMENSE WEIGHT FOR ELECTRICAL CAPACITY
A HOUSE IN MILAN ON WHICH SOME OF THOSE SHINGLES WERE PUT IN 1844 WAS STILL IN EXCELLENT CONDITION FORTY-TWO YEARS LATER
BUT I THOUGHT HE MIGHT PERHAPS BE MISTAKEN AS THERE HAD BEEN MANY SUCH INSTANCES ON RECORD
EDISON REALIZED THAT THE SECRET OF GREATER COMMERCIAL EFFICIENCY AND IMPROVEMENT OF QUALITY LAY IN THE ABILITY TO HANDLE LARGER QUANTITIES OF MATERIAL WITHIN A GIVEN TIME AND TO PRODUCE A MORE PERFECT PRODUCT WITHOUT INCREASING COST OR INVESTMENT IN PROPORTION
SHE STAYED THERE ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF
GOULD WAS POUNDING THE WESTERN UNION ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE DISTURBING ITS RAILROAD CONTRACTS AND BEING ADVISED BY HIS LAWYERS THAT THIS PATENT WAS OF GREAT VALUE BOUGHT IT
THE CHAIRMAN SIR WILLIAM THOMSON LORD KELVIN MADE THE FOLLOWING REMARKS
THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THIS INVENTION WERE FIRST TO SEVER ENTIRELY ANY DIRECT CONNECTION OF THE MAIN CONDUCTORS WITH THE SOURCE OF ENERGY
THE LETTER HOWEVER GAVE NO INTIMATION OF THE NATURE OF THE OBJECT FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN INVITED TO APPEAR BEFORE MR EDISON
BUT IN THE EXACT COPYING OR DUPLICATION OF SUCH A RECORD WITH ITS MANY MILLIONS OF MICROSCOPIC WAVES AND SUB-WAVES THE DIFFICULTIES ARE ENORMOUSLY INCREASED
MARCH 20 1891 475,491 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE
5 1881 293,434 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP DEC
DOES HE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RUNNING A STATION LIKE THIS
THE ENORMOUS FORCE EXERTED DURING THIS PROCESS MAY BE ILLUSTRATED FROM THE FACT THAT DURING ITS DEVELOPMENT IN RUNNING ONE OF THE EARLY FORMS OF ROLLS PIECES OF ROCK WEIGHING MORE THAN HALF A TON WOULD BE SHOT UP IN THE AIR TO A HEIGHT OF TWENTY OR TWENTY-FIVE FEET
SHOWN AT A AND FIRMLY CLAMPED AT B
VOLUMINOUS RECORDS WERE MADE BY BOTH PARTIES TO THE SUIT AND IN THE SPRING OF 1894 THE CASE WAS ARGUED BEFORE THE LATE JUDGE TOWNSEND WHO WROTE A LONG OPINION DISMISSING THE BILL OF COMPLAINT
BY-AND-BY THE FUN BEGAN
THE ANIMAL KNOCKED HIM AGAINST THE FENCE AND WAS ABOUT TO BUTT HIM AGAIN WHEN HE MANAGED TO DROP OVER ON THE SAFE SIDE AND ESCAPE
THE THING WAS INDEED WELL DONE AS THE WORK OF A YOUTH SHOWN BY THE DATE TO BE LESS THAN FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
ON RELEASING THE KEY THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN AND MAGNETISM INSTANTLY CEASES
JULY 16 1884 328,573 SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING
HE HAS TOLD ME THAT HE NEVER DREAMED
THIS ROPE WAS WOUND SEVEN TIMES OVER THE SHEAVES AS ABOVE AND LED UPWARD AND OVER A SINGLE-GROOVE SHEAVE WHICH WAS OPERATED BY THE PISTON OF AN AIR CYLINDER AND IN THIS MANNER THE PRESSURE WAS APPLIED TO THE ROLLS
WHEN MR EDISON DECIDED TO SHUT DOWN THE ORE-MILLING PLANT AT EDISON NEW JERSEY IN WHICH I HAD BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIM IT BECAME A PROBLEM AS TO WHAT HE COULD PROFITABLY TAKE UP NEXT AND WE HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IT
ONE IS ABOVE AND THE OTHER BELOW THE BEARING
NOTWITHSTANDING THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF THOUGHT AND LABOR EXPENDED ON THE INCANDESCENT LAMP PROBLEM FROM THE AUTUMN OF 1878 TO THE WINTER OF 1879 IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED FOR ONE MOMENT THAT EDISON'S WHOLE ENDEAVOR AND ENTIRE INVENTIVE SKILL HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE LAMP ALONE OR THE DYNAMO ALONE
THEY HAD TIMED THEIR DEPARTURE FROM LOUISVILLE SO AS TO CATCH A SPECIALLY CHARTERED STEAMER WHICH WAS TO LEAVE NEW ORLEANS FOR BRAZIL ON A CERTAIN DAY TO CONVEY A LARGE NUMBER OF CONFEDERATES AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO WERE DISGUSTED WITH THE UNITED STATES AND WERE GOING TO SETTLE IN BRAZIL WHERE SLAVERY STILL PREVAILED
802,631
EXPERIENCE HAS PROVEN THAT THIS NOT ONLY SECURES DURABILITY AND GREATER OUTPUT PER UNIT-WEIGHT OF BATTERY BUT IN ADDITION THERE IS ELIMINATED A LONG LIST OF TROUBLES AND DISEASES INHERENT IN THE LEAD-ACID COMBINATION
I LET HIM GO AHEAD
EDISON FOLLOWED UP HIS WORK ON THE DIPLEX AND COMBINED THE TWO SYSTEMS INTO THE QUADRUPLEX BY MEANS OF WHICH FOUR MESSAGES COULD BE SENT AND RECEIVED SIMULTANEOUSLY OVER THE ONE WIRE TWO IN EACH DIRECTION THUS EMPLOYING EIGHT OPERATORS--FOUR AT EACH END--TWO SENDING AND TWO RECEIVING
AND I RECEIVED A REPLY THAT THE ONLY WAY HE COULD PROPOSE TO GET AROUND THE DIFFICULTY WAS TO PUT THE ISLAND ON A PIVOT SO IT COULD BE TURNED AROUND
ITS FAME AROSE FROM THE FACT THAT EDISON PLANNED IT TO BE A REPOSITORY OF SOME QUANTITY GREAT OR SMALL OF EVERY KNOWN AND POSSIBLY USEFUL SUBSTANCE NOT READILY PERISHABLE TOGETHER WITH THE MOST COMPLETE ASSORTMENT OF CHEMICALS AND DRUGS THAT EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE COULD SUGGEST
ONE HOT SATURDAY NIGHT AFTER MR EDISON HAD LOOKED OVER THE EVENING PAPERS HE SAID TO ME
THAT MAN SAT AROUND THAT SHOP AND SLEPT IN IT FOR THREE WEEKS UNTIL HE GOT HIS ENGINE RIGHT AND MADE IT WORK THE WAY HE WANTED IT TO
HIS TRAIN LEFT PORT HURON AT 7 A.M AND MADE ITS SOUTHWARD TRIP TO DETROIT IN ABOUT THREE HOURS
BUT NOW WE ARE ALL BEGINNING TO CALL THESE INDUCTIVE PHENOMENA ETHERIC WITH THESE PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS LET US NOW GLANCE BRIEFLY AT EDISON'S LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS OF WHICH MENTION HAS BEEN MADE
THERE WERE ASTRONOMERS FROM NEARLY EVERY NATION SAYS MR EDISON
EDISON HAD A FEW MINOR CORRECTIONS TO MAKE PROBABLY NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN ALL TOLD
THE IRON PIN AND THE DRUM WERE RESPECTIVELY CONNECTED SO AS TO BE IN CIRCUIT WITH THE TRANSMISSION LINE AND BATTERIES
WE MADE UP A SCHEME TO HOLD THIS WIRE SO HE CHANGED ONE LETTER OF THE ALPHABET AND I SOON GOT USED TO IT
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF MY ELECTRIC LIGHT HE SAYS CURIOSITY AND INTEREST BROUGHT A GREAT MANY PEOPLE TO MENLO PARK TO SEE IT
WE THEN SUBSTITUTED THE GRAPHITE POINTS INSTEAD OF IRON 26 FOOTNOTE 26
THE CARBON TRANSMITTER WAS AN EXPERIMENTAL INVENTION OF A VERY HIGH ORDER OF MERIT
AND ON THE 22D OF FEBRUARY ON THE SAME DAY AT THE SAME HOUR AT THE SAME MINUTE ONE YEAR TO A SECOND LITTLE MAUDE A SWEET MAID OF THE SCHOOL LED ME ACROSS THE LINE WHICH COMPLETED THE CIRCUIT OF THE GLOBE AND WHERE I WAS GREETED BY THE CHEERS OF MY BOYS AND GIRLS
THEN SOUTH ANOTHER THOUSAND FEET ACROSS AGAIN AND SO ON
BY SUCH PRACTICAL METHODS EDISON FOUND THAT THE THIN LAMINATED CORES OF SHEET IRON GAVE THE LEAST HEAT AND HAD THE LEAST AMOUNT OF WASTEFUL EDDY CURRENTS
TESTS WERE MADE BETWEEN NEW YORK AND PHILADELPHIA ALSO BETWEEN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON USING REGULAR WESTERN UNION WIRES
THESE WERE ABSORBED IN ENTERPRISES ALREADY EXISTING AND WERE THE MEANS OF ASSISTING THEIR RAPID GROWTH AND EXPANSION PARTICULARLY THE TELEPHONE INDUSTRY
THERE WERE SEVERAL WESTERN UNION WIRES CUT INTO THE LABORATORY AND USED BY ME IN EXPERIMENTING AT NIGHT
THE LANDLORD REQUESTED HIM NOT TO MAKE SO MUCH NOISE AND WAS THROWN OUT INTO THE HALL
IF YOU FIND SOMETHING EQUAL TO THAT I WILL BE SATISFIED AT THE HOME I WAS GUIDED TO THE LIBRARY BY AN IRISH SERVANT-WOMAN TO WHOM I COMMUNICATED MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE DEFINITE LOCALITY OF THE SAMPLE JOINT
THE INVENTION OF THE INCANDESCENT LAMP XII
IN THE CASE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THE HEATING OF A CONDUCTOR TO INCANDESCENCE IN A HIGHLY RAREFIED ATMOSPHERE WAS SUGGESTED AS A SCHEME OF ILLUMINATION LONG BEFORE ITS ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENT AND IN FACT BEFORE THE PRODUCTION OF A SUITABLE GENERATOR FOR DELIVERING ELECTRIC CURRENT IN A SATISFACTORY AND ECONOMICAL MANNER
THAT THE INVENTION WAS OF A TRULY FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTER IS ALSO EVIDENT FROM THE FACT THAT ALTHOUGH ALL TALKING-MACHINES OF TO-DAY DIFFER VERY WIDELY IN REFINEMENT FROM THE FIRST CRUDE BUT SUCCESSFUL PHONOGRAPH OF EDISON THEIR PERFORMANCE IS ABSOLUTELY DEPENDENT UPON THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE PRINCIPLES STATED BY HIM IN HIS PATENT NO
AFTER LEAVING THE GIANT ROLLS THE BROKEN ROCK PASSED ON THROUGH OTHER CRUSHING-ROLLS OF SOMEWHAT SIMILAR CONSTRUCTION
AND THE PROCESS MUST BE CHEAP AND COMMERCIAL NOT A SCIENTIFIC LABORATORY POSSIBILITY
NOR ARE THESE GROUPS AND DELEGATIONS LIMITED TO THIS COUNTRY FOR EVEN LARGE PARTIES OF ENGLISH DUTCH ITALIAN OR JAPANESE VISITORS COME FROM TIME TO TIME AND ARE GREETED WITH THE SAME READY HOSPITALITY ALTHOUGH EDISON IT IS EASY TO SEE IS TORN BETWEEN THE CONFLICTING EMOTIONS OF A DESIRE TO BE COURTEOUS AND AN ANXIETY TO GUARD THE PRECIOUS HOURS OF WORK OR WATCH THE CRITICAL STAGE OF A NEW EXPERIMENT
I VISITED THE EIFFEL TOWER AT THE INVITATION OF EIFFEL
BUT THE PARIS NEWSPAPERS CAME AROUND AND WANTED PAY FOR NOTICES OF IT WHICH WE PROMPTLY REFUSED
THEY ALWAYS MADE HIM CHEERFUL AND STARTED HIM THINKING
METHODS OF REAMING OF FORMING RIBS ON THE INTERIOR AND FOR MANY OTHER IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL DETAILS WHICH LIMITS OF SPACE WILL NOT PERMIT OF ELABORATION
HIS NEXT STEP PROVED CONCLUSIVELY THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS OLD DEDUCTIONS
WELL MR EDISON WE COMPLETED A THOUSAND LAMPS TO-DAY EDISON LOOKED UP AND SAID GOOD THEN RELAPSED INTO A THOUGHTFUL MOOD
THE WHOLE CRUSHING OPERATION OF REDUCTION FROM MASSIVE BOULDERS TO SMALL PEBBLY PIECES HAVING BEEN DONE IN LESS TIME THAN THE TELLING HAS OCCUPIED THE PRODUCT WAS CONVEYED TO THE DRYER A TOWER NINE FEET SQUARE AND FIFTY FEET HIGH HEATED FROM BELOW BY GREAT OPEN FURNACE FIRES
BEYOND WAS A PRIZE AS INTANGIBLE AS THE BUTTON OF THE LEGION OF HONOR WHICH HE CONCEALED FROM HIS FRIENDS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT FEEL HE WAS SHOWING OFF THE FACT IS THAT EDISON CARES LITTLE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE WORLD BUT THAT HE CARES EVERYTHING FOR THE APPROVAL OF HIMSELF
ONE DAY ONE OF THE DIRECTORS BROUGHT IN THREE OR FOUR LADIES TO THE WORKS TO SEE THE NEW ELECTRIC-LIGHT SYSTEM

OF THEIR OWN VOLUME IN ALCOHOL BUT REPELLING WATER ABSOLUTELY--PERFECT OLD SOAKS THUS WITH NEVER-FAILING PERSISTENCE AND PATIENCE COUPLED WITH INTENSE THOUGHT AND HARD WORK EDISON MET AND CONQUERED ONE BY ONE THE COMPLEX DIFFICULTIES THAT CONFRONTED HIM
THE STATE THAT RIVALS VIRGINIA AS A MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS HAS EVIDENTLY OTHER TITLES TO DISTINCTION OF THE SAME NATURE
HE ALSO SPENT GREAT SUMS OF MONEY AND DEVOTED SEVERAL YEARS OF PATIENT LABOR IN THE EARLY PRACTICAL EXPLOITATION OF THE DYNAMO AND CENTRAL STATION AND ISOLATED PLANTS OFTEN UNDER ADVERSE AND DEPRESSING CIRCUMSTANCES WITH A DOGGED DETERMINATION THAT OUTLIVED AN OPPOSITION STEADILY THREATENING DEFEAT
DESTRUCTION OF ADJACENT METALWORK BY THE CORROSIVE FUMES GIVEN OUT DURING CHARGE AND DISCHARGE
IT WAS THEN AND FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD AND ITS ARRIVAL AND INSTALLATION IN PARIS WERE EAGERLY WATCHED BY THE MOST FAMOUS PHYSICISTS AND ELECTRICIANS OF EUROPE
AND SO IT WENT WITH REGARD TO ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AS WELL AS THOSE OF SOUTH AMERICA

IT CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF SILK DISKS SATURATED WITH A SIZING OF PLUMBAGO AND WELL DRIED

THIS MACHINE WENT INTO EXTENSIVE COMMERCIAL USE AND WAS NOTABLE FOR ITS VERY MASSIVE AND POWERFUL FIELD-MAGNETS AND ARMATURE OF EXTREMELY LOW RESISTANCE AS COMPARED WITH THE COMBINED EXTERNAL RESISTANCE OF THE SUPPLY-MAINS AND LAMPS
THE SOUNDNESS OF HIS REASONING IS AMPLY JUSTIFIED BY THE PERFECTION OF RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE NEW TYPE OF STORAGE BATTERY BEARING HIS NAME AND NOW TO BE DESCRIBED
MECHANICAL DEFECTS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN TROUBLES IN ANY PART OF THE PLANT OR UNDERGROUND SYSTEM MIGHT ARISE AND CAUSE TEMPORARY STOPPAGES OF OPERATION THUS GIVING GROUNDS FOR UNCERTAINTY WHICH WOULD CREATE A FEELING OF PUBLIC DISTRUST IN THE PERMANENCE OF THE SUPPLY OF LIGHT
COMING HOME RESTED AND REFRESHED MR EDISON SAYS

NOT THAT HIS PATENTS COVER HIS ENTIRE RANGE OF WORK BY ANY MEANS FOR HIS NOTE-BOOKS REVEAL A GREAT NUMBER OF MAJOR AND MINOR INVENTIONS FOR WHICH HE HAS NOT SEEN FIT TO TAKE OUT PATENTS
NOW LET'S PITCH INTO WORK AGAIN ANOTHER INTERESTING AND AMUSING REMINISCENCE OF THIS PERIOD OF ACTIVITY HAS BEEN GATHERED FROM ANOTHER OF THE FAMILY OF EXPERIMENTERS
I LEARNED AFTERWARD THAT THEY WERE MOSTLY GOING TO THE VIENNA EXPOSITION
HIS GREAT EXPERIENCE AND STANDING THREW A WET BLANKET ON MY HOPES
THIS INVENTION RELATES TO A METHOD OF EQUALIZING THE TENSION OR PRESSURE OF THE CURRENT THROUGH AN ENTIRE SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING OR OTHER TRANSLATION OF ELECTRIC FORCE PREVENTING WHAT IS ORDINARILY KNOWN AS A DROP IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE SYSTEM THE MORE REMOTE FROM THE CENTRAL STATION THE PROBLEM WHICH WAS SOLVED BY THE EDISON FEEDER SYSTEM WAS THAT RELATING TO THE EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF CURRENT ON A LARGE SCALE OVER EXTENDED AREAS IN ORDER THAT A CONSTANT AND UNIFORM ELECTRICAL PRESSURE COULD BE MAINTAINED IN EVERY PART OF THE DISTRIBUTION AREA WITHOUT PROHIBITORY EXPENDITURE FOR COPPER FOR MAINS AND CONDUCTORS
TRAIN THEN WALKED HALF A MILE TO MR POPE'S HOUSE AND UP AT 6 A.M
IN THEIR APPLICATION TO THE MANUFACTURE OF BATTERIES THE FLAKES ARE USED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF A SPECIAL MACHINE SO ARRANGED THAT SMALL CHARGES OF NICKEL HYDRATE AND NICKEL FLAKE ARE ALTERNATELY FED INTO THE POCKETS INTENDED FOR POSITIVES AND TAMPED DOWN WITH A PRESSURE EQUAL TO ABOUT FOUR TONS PER SQUARE INCH
HAD THE MAIN BODY EXPLODED THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING LEFT OF THE LABORATORY I WAS WORKING IN
AND TO-DAY IN HUNDREDS OF CITIES THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROPERTIES ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT EDISON DID NOT SIT WITH FOLDED HANDS OR DROP INTO COMPLACENT SATISFACTION THE MOMENT HE HAD REACHED THE PRACTICAL STAGE OF COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION
AN OUTLAY SO GREAT AS TO BE ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITORY IN CONSIDERING THE ELECTRIC LIGHTING OF LARGE DISTRICTS AS NOW PRACTICED
THUS THERE WAS INTRODUCED A NEW FEATURE INTO THE ART OF MULTIPLEX TELEGRAPHY FOR WHEREAS DUPLEXING ACCOMPLISHED BY VARYING THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT PERMITTED MESSAGES TO BE SENT SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM OPPOSITE STATIONS DIPLEXING ACHIEVED BY ALSO VARYING THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT PERMITTED THE SIMULTANEOUS TRANSMISSION OF TWO MESSAGES FROM THE SAME STATION AND THEIR SEPARATE RECEPTION AT THE DISTANT STATION

NOTHING IS MORE DIFFICULT IN THE WORLD THAN TO GET A GOOD MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING THEY HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE
THE EFFECT IS TO PARTIALLY ARREST THE SWIFT MOTION OF THE ROLLS INSTANTANEOUSLY AND THEREBY DEVELOP AND EXPEND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF KINETIC ENERGY WHICH WITH PILE-DRIVER EFFECT CRACKS THE ROCKS AND BREAKS THEM INTO PIECES SMALL ENOUGH TO PASS THROUGH THE FOURTEEN-INCH GAP
I HAVE SINCE BEEN UTTERLY UNABLE TO FIND OUT WHAT BECAME OF THE MAN OR THE MACHINERY SUCH INCIDENTS TEND TO JUSTIFY EDISON IN HIS RATHER CYNICAL REMARK THAT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE MACHINERY MUCH QUICKER THAN MEN

IT MIGHT BE SUGGESTED AS A SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM THAT LAMPS OF DIFFERENT VOLTAGES COULD BE USED
THE CRUSHED ROCK BEING DELIVERED AT THE TOP WOULD FALL DOWN FROM PLATE TO PLATE CONSTANTLY EXPOSING DIFFERENT SURFACES TO THE HEAT UNTIL IT LANDED COMPLETELY DRIED IN THE LOWER PORTION OF THE TOWER WHERE IT FELL INTO CONVEYORS WHICH TOOK IT UP TO THE STOCK-HOUSE
I BEG YOUR HONORS TO READ THE TESTIMONY OF MR CLARKE IN THE LIGHT OF THE ANECDOTE OF THE PICKEREL AND THE ROACH OWING TO LONG-PROTRACTED DELAYS INCIDENT TO THE TAKING OF TESTIMONY AND PREPARATION FOR TRIAL THE ARGUMENT BEFORE THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS WAS NOT HAD UNTIL THE LATE SPRING OF 1892 AND ITS DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE EDISON LAMP PATENT WAS FILED ON OCTOBER 4 1892 MORE THAN TWELVE YEARS AFTER THE ISSUANCE OF THE PATENT ITSELF
THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF THE MIMEOGRAPH DOES NOT COME WITHIN THE ENTERPRISES CONDUCTED UNDER EDISON'S PERSONAL DIRECTION AS HE SOLD OUT THE WHOLE THING SOME YEARS AGO TO MR A
THERE WAS A BIG FIGHT ON BETWEEN GOULD'S COMPANY AND THE WESTERN UNION AND THIS CAUSED MORE LITIGATION
HAMMER PUBLISHED IN THE ELECTRICAL WORLD NEW YORK JUNE 10 1899 AND AFTERWARD ELABORATED AND REPRINTED IN A VOLUME ENTITLED EDISONIA COMPILED AND PUBLISHED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF A COMMITTEE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN 1904
MOST INTERESTING ARE THE BULLETIN NOTES FROM ENGLAND ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO THE BRILLIANT EXHIBITION GIVEN BY MR E
MOREOVER THIS CONTROVERSY OVER THE TWO CURRENTS ALTERNATING AND DIRECT WHICH HAS BECOME HISTORICAL IN THE FIELD OF ELECTRICITY--AND IS SOMETHING LIKE THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT WE HEARD OF YEARS AGO IN NATIONAL AFFAIRS--ILLUSTRATES ANOTHER ASPECT OF EDISON'S CHARACTER

MAIL-CAR TO DO A FREE FREIGHT BUSINESS WAS SO MONUMENTAL
THE ONLY ANSWER I CAN THINK OF IS THAT NO ONE ELSE WAS EDISON UNDAUNTED BY THE ATTITUDE OF DOUBT AND THE PREDICTIONS OF IMPOSSIBILITY EDISON HAD PUSHED ON UNTIL HE WAS NOW ABLE TO REALIZE ALL HIS IDEAS AS TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CENTRAL STATION IN THE WORK THAT CULMINATED IN NEW YORK CITY IN 1882
WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE SAID
HE SPLIT UP THE IRON CORE OF THE ARMATURE INTO THIN LAMINATIONS SEPARATED BY PAPER THUS PRACTICALLY SUPPRESSING FOUCAULT CURRENTS THEREIN AND RESULTING HEATING EFFECT

THE QUALITY OF CULTURE IN THAT SIMPLE BUT REFINED HOME AS WELL AS THE INTELLECTUAL CHARACTER OF THIS YOUTH WITHOUT SCHOOLING MAY BE INFERRED FROM THE FACT THAT BEFORE HE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF TWELVE HE HAD READ WITH HIS MOTHER'S HELP GIBBON'S DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE HUME'S HISTORY OF ENGLAND SEARS HISTORY OF THE WORLD BURTON'S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY AND THE DICTIONARY OF SCIENCES
HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN
CHAPTER XXVII THE VALUE OF EDISON'S INVENTIONS TO THE WORLD IF THE WORLD WERE TO TAKE AN ACCOUNT OF STOCK SO TO SPEAK AND PROCEED IN ORDERLY FASHION TO MARSHAL ITS TANGIBLE ASSETS IN RELATION TO DOLLARS AND CENTS THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF OUR GLOBE FROM CENTRE TO CIRCUMFERENCE WOULD HEAD THE LIST
SUPPLEMENTAL INVENTIONS HOWEVER IN ANY ART NEW OR OLD ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE WHICH EMANATE FROM THE ORIGINAL WORKERS FOR THE INGENUITY OF MAN INFLUENCED BY THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES SEIZES UPON ANY NOVEL LINE OF ACTION AND SEEKS TO IMPROVE OR ENLARGE UPON IT OR AT ANY RATE TO PRODUCE MORE OR LESS VARIATION OF ITS PHASES
SIX OF EDISON'S PATENTS ON CONVEYORS INCLUDE A VARIETY OF DEVICES THAT HAVE SINCE CAME INTO BROAD GENERAL USE FOR SIMILAR WORK AND HAVE BEEN THE MEANS OF EFFECTING GREAT ECONOMIES IN NUMEROUS INDUSTRIES OF WIDELY VARYING KINDS
HAD NOT EDISON SUSPENDED THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF HIS STORAGE BATTERY A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH IT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GIVEN HERE SOME NOTEWORTHY FIGURES OF AN EXTENSIVE BUSINESS FOR THE COMPANY'S BOOKS SHOW AN ASTONISHING NUMBER OF ORDERS THAT WERE RECEIVED DURING THE TIME OF THE SHUT-DOWN
OVER FIFTY SEPARATE PATENTS WERE INVOLVED IN THESE SUITS INCLUDING THE BASIC ONE ON THE LAMP ORDINARILY CALLED THE FILAMENT PATENT OTHER DETAIL LAMP PATENTS AS WELL AS THOSE ON SOCKETS SWITCHES DYNAMOS MOTORS AND DISTRIBUTING SYSTEMS
PREVIOUS TO THE DUMPING OF A SKIP THE ROLLS WERE SPEEDED UP TO A CIRCUMFERENTIAL VELOCITY OF NEARLY A MILE A MINUTE THUS IMPARTING TO THEM THE TERRIFIC MOMENTUM THAT WOULD BREAK UP EASILY IN A FEW SECONDS BOULDERS WEIGHING FIVE OR SIX TONS EACH
IT IS GENERALLY IN THE NATURE OF THINGS EASIER TO WRITE A LETTER THAN TO MAKE A CALL
THE GIANT ROLLS WERE TWO SOLID CYLINDERS SIX FEET IN DIAMETER AND FIVE FEET LONG MADE OF CAST IRON
HE OBEYED ORDERS
EDISON HIMSELF TELLS THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED
FINALLY WHEN THE LAST TRIP WAS TO BE TAKEN I SAID I DID NOT LIKE IT BUT WOULD GO ALONG
THE MAGNETIC SEPARATION OF IRON FROM ITS ORE BEING THE FOUNDATION IDEA OF THE INVENTIONS NOW UNDER DISCUSSION A CONSIDERATION OF THE SEPARATOR HAS NATURALLY TAKEN PRECEDENCE OVER THOSE OF COLLATERAL BUT INSEPARABLE INTEREST
I THOUGHT THAT COMMERCIALLY THE THING WAS TOO AMBITIOUS THAT FERRANTI'S IDEAS WERE TOO BIG JUST THEN
THUS WAS THE EDISON FAMILY REPATRIATED BY A PICTURESQUE POLITICAL EPISODE AND THE GREAT INVENTOR GIVEN A BIRTHPLACE ON AMERICAN SOIL JUST AS WAS BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WHEN HIS FATHER CAME FROM ENGLAND TO BOSTON
THAT IS TRUE ONLY SO FAR AS CHEMISTRY IS CONCERNED
11
I SAID I WOULD GO AT IT THAT NIGHT
THE FRACTION DRUM OF THE INDICATOR COULD BE DRIVEN IN EITHER DIRECTION KNOWN AS THE ADVANCE AND RETROGRADE MOVEMENTS AND WAS DIVIDED AND MARKED IN EIGHTHS
28 1891 470,930 DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE
WE NOW TRIED THE CRUCIAL TEST OF PASSING THE ETHERIC CURRENT THROUGH THE SCIATIC NERVE OF A FROG JUST KILLED
WE COULD MAKE SOME VERY GOOD PYROTECHNICS THERE SO WE DETERMINED TO GIVE THE INDIANS A SCARE
WHEN THEY GOT THERE BERGMANN WAS ALL DONE UP BUT MY FATHER NEVER SHOWED A SIGN OF IT
AS FULLY THREE-FOURTHS OF THE AREA OF THEIR EXTERIOR FRAMEWORK CONSISTS OF WINDOWS AN ABUNDANCE OF DAYLIGHT IS SECURED
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST TO USE MICA IN INSULATING THE COMMUTATOR SECTIONS FROM EACH OTHER IN THE MEAN TIME DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS ON THE DYNAMO WORD HAD GONE OUT TO THE WORLD THAT EDISON EXPECTED TO INVENT A GENERATOR OF GREATER EFFICIENCY THAN ANY THAT EXISTED AT THE TIME
THE TROUBLE WAS WITH THE GOVERNORS
BUT HE FOUND THEN THAT THIS DEVICE MADE IN 1875 WAS CAPABLE OF USE AS A TELEPHONE
THE CHIEF DIFFICULTIES IN THE TRANSMISSION OF MORSE CHARACTERS HAD BEEN TWO IN NUMBER THE MOST SERIOUS OF WHICH WAS THAT ON THE RECEIVING TAPE THE CHARACTERS WOULD BE PROLONGED AND RUN INTO ONE ANOTHER FORMING A DRAGGLED LINE AND THUS RENDERING THE MESSAGE UNINTELLIGIBLE
THIS AROSE FROM THE FACT THAT ON ACCOUNT OF THE RAPID SUCCESSION OF THE ELECTRIC IMPULSES THERE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TIME BETWEEN THEM FOR THE ELECTRIC ACTION TO CEASE ENTIRELY
THE STOVE-PIPE FELL DISLOCATED AT EVERY JOINT
EDISON SEPTEMBER 8 1878 MADE UNDER THE ELECTRIC LIGHT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PARTY LEFT SIMILAR MEMORIALS WHICH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE COME TO BE GREATLY PRIZED
THEY ELABORATED THE SYSTEM IN VARIOUS WAYS MAKING IT MORE COMPLETE
AT ONE END OF THE NEWLY ACQUIRED LAND TWO UNPRETENTIOUS BRICK STRUCTURES WERE ERECTED EQUIPPED WITH FIRST-CLASS MACHINERY AND PUT INTO COMMISSION AS SHOPS FOR MANUFACTURING PHONOGRAPHS AND THEIR RECORD BLANKS
18 1902 873,219 FEED REGULATORS FOR GRINDING MACHINES
28 1891 474,593 DUST-PROOF SWIVEL SHAFT BEARING
BUT AT WHATEVER HOUR THE VISITOR RETIRES OR GETS UP HE IS SURE TO FIND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE ON HAND SERENE AND REPOSEFUL AND JUST AS BRISK AT DAWN AS WHEN HE ALLOWED THE CONVERSATION TO BREAK UP AT MIDNIGHT
NEXT I HEARD OF HIM IN NEW YORK HAVING JUST ARRIVED FROM BOGOTA UNITED STATES OF COLOMBIA WITH A POWER OF ATTORNEY AND $2000 FROM A NATIVE OF THAT REPUBLIC WHO HAD APPLIED FOR A PATENT FOR TIGHTENING A BELT TO PREVENT IT FROM SLIPPING ON A PULLEY--A DEVICE WHICH HE THOUGHT A NEW AND GREAT INVENTION BUT WHICH WAS IN USE EVER SINCE MACHINERY WAS INVENTED
WHEN I STARTED FROM BERLIN ON THE TRIP I BEGAN TO TELL AMERICAN STORIES
AND MR SPRAGUE IS JUSTIFIED IN OBSERVING IN HIS CENTURY ARTICLE
WHEN MR DREYER TRIED TO ORGANIZE A COMPANY IN 1882 AND PROCURED AN OPTION FROM HIM OF ALL HIS INVENTIONS RELATING TO ELECTRIC LIGHTING FOR WHICH $925 WAS PAID AND WHEN AN OLD LAMP OF THIS KIND WAS OF VITAL CONSEQUENCE AND WOULD HAVE INSURED A FORTUNE WHY WAS IT NOT FORTHCOMING
THE PLATE GLASS WAS THEN REMOVED AND THE PICKEREL AND THE RED ROACH SAILED AROUND TOGETHER IN PERFECT PEACE EVER AFTERWARD
POPE AND EDISON INVENTED A ONE-WIRE PRINTER AND STARTED A SYSTEM OF GOLD PRINTERS DEVOTED TO THE RECORDING OF GOLD QUOTATIONS AND STERLING EXCHANGE ONLY
AN ELECTRIC BELL OR ELECTRIC LIGHT IS A FAMILIAR INSTANCE OF THIS RULE
AND THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THESE ON THE WORLD'S AFFAIRS HAS NOT BEEN EXCELLED AT ANY TIME BY THAT OF ANY OTHER CORRESPONDING ADVANCES IN THE ARTS AND SCIENCES
THE POSSIBILITY OF ELECTRICAL STARVATION WAS FOREVER LEFT BEHIND
AFTER A WHILE I TIRED OF THIS WORK AS HOEING CORN IN A HOT SUN IS UNATTRACTIVE AND I DID NOT WONDER THAT IT HAD BUILT UP CITIES
THIS DISK FORM WAS ALSO COVERED BY EDISON'S APPLICATION FOR A UNITED STATES PATENT FILED IN 1879
EDISON HAS INDEED TOUCHED NOTHING THAT HE DID NOT IN SOME WAY IMPROVE
ON MAKING INQUIRY OF THE ENGINEERS OF THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY HIS THEORY WAS FULLY SUSTAINED
IF A ROD OF SOFT IRON BE WOUND AROUND WITH A NUMBER OF TURNS OF INSULATED WIRE AND A CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY BE SENT THROUGH THE WIRE THE ROD WILL BE INSTANTLY MAGNETIZED AND WILL REMAIN A MAGNET AS LONG AS THE CURRENT FLOWS
JOHNSON RETURNED TO AMERICA LATE IN THE FALL OF 1880 AND IN JANUARY 1881 CABLED TO ME TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY
THE LOUNGING-ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR IS MORE OR LESS OF AN EDISON MUSEUM FOR IT IS LITTERED WITH SOUVENIRS FROM GREAT PEOPLE AND WITH MEMENTOS OF TRAVEL ALL RELATED TO SOME EVENT OR EPISODE
AS FOR THE NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS CONTAINING SUCH ARTICLES OR OTHERS IN WHICH EDISON'S NAME APPEARS--THEY ARE LITERALLY LIKE SANDS OF THE SEA-SHORE FOR NUMBER
IT HAS SINCE BEEN EMPLOYED BY FLEMING IN ENGLAND AND DE FOREST IN THIS COUNTRY AND OTHERS AS THE BASIS FOR WIRELESS-TELEGRAPH APPARATUS
BUT THE DIFFICULTIES OF THESE EARLY DAYS WERE ALMOST INSURMOUNTABLE
IT WOULD SEEM TO STIFFEN HIS BACKBONE AND MAKE HIM MORE PROLIFIC OF NEW IDEAS
26 1872 141,773 CIRCUITS FOR AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHS
THESE DATA REVEALED THE FACT THAT THE QUANTITY OF COPPER REQUIRED FOR THE MAIN CONDUCTORS WOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY LARGE AND COSTLY
JULY 5 1890 484,585 PHONOGRAPH JULY 5 1890 456,302 PHONOGRAPH AUG
OFTEN AT NIGHT IN THE SMALL HOURS ALL WOULD ADJOURN FOR REFRESHMENTS TO A FAMOUS RESORT NEARBY TO DISCUSS THE EVENTS OF TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW FULL OF INCIDENT AND EXCITEMENT
14 THE BUS-BARS TO RECEIVE THE CURRENT FROM THE DYNAMOS WERE MADE OF NO
IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT IN ADDITION TO THOSE MENTIONED ABOVE CHARLES BATCHELOR AND FRANK UPTON I HAD AROUND ME OTHER MEN WHO EVER SINCE HAVE REMAINED ACTIVE IN THE FIELD SUCH AS MESSRS
FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION OF FEEDER PATENT SEE APPENDIX FROM THESE TWO PATENTS ALONE WHICH WERE ABSOLUTELY BASIC AND FUNDAMENTAL IN EFFECT AND BOTH OF WHICH WERE AND STILL ARE PUT INTO ACTUAL USE WHEREVER CENTRAL-STATION LIGHTING IS PRACTICED THE READER WILL SEE THAT MR EDISON'S PATIENT AND THOROUGH STUDY AIDED BY HIS KEEN FORESIGHT AND UNERRING JUDGMENT HAD ENABLED HIM TO GRASP IN ADVANCE WITH A MASTER HAND THE CHIEF AND UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF A TRUE SYSTEM--THAT SYSTEM WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN PUT INTO PRACTICAL USE ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WHOSE ELEMENTS DO NOT NEED THE TOUCH OR CHANGE OF MORE MODERN SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE
THEN HE COULD REPORT HOW EASILY THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WENT OUT AND A FALSE IMPRESSION WOULD BE CONVEYED TO THE PUBLIC
IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE IN CONNECTION WITH THE EDISON TYPE OF KILN THAT WHEN THE OLDER CEMENT MANUFACTURERS FIRST LEARNED OF IT THEY RIDICULED THE IDEA UNIVERSALLY AND WERE NOT SLOW TO PREDICT OUR EARLY FINISH AS CEMENT MANUFACTURERS
JULY 31 1891 509,518 ELECTRIC RAILWAY JULY 31 1891 589,168 KINETOGRAPHIC CAMERA REISSUED SEPTEMBER 30 1902 NUMBERED 12,037 AND 12,038 AND JANUARY 12 1904 NUMBERED 12,192 JULY 31 1891 470,929 MAGNETIC SEPARATOR AUG
BUILDING THE PRINCIPLE INTO APPARATUS WITH A KEYBOARD AND VIBRATING REEDS BEFORE HIS MAGNETS DOCTOR GRAY WAS ABLE NOT ONLY TO TRANSMIT MUSIC BY HIS HARMONIC TELEGRAPH BUT WENT SO FAR AS TO SEND NINE DIFFERENT TELEGRAPH MESSAGES AT THE SAME INSTANT EACH SET OF INSTRUMENTS DEPENDING ON ITS SELECTIVE NOTE WHILE ANY INTERMEDIATE OFFICE COULD PICK UP THE MESSAGE FOR ITSELF BY SIMPLY TUNING ITS RELAYS TO THE KEYNOTE REQUIRED
IN THE MEAN TIME THE MIND THAT CONCEIVED AND MADE PRACTICAL THIS INVENTION COULD NOT REST CONTENT WITH ANYTHING LESS THAN PERFECTION SO FAR AS IT COULD BE REALIZED
THE SHIFTING OF THE TYPE-WHEELS IS BROUGHT ABOUT AS FOLLOWS
26 1886 411,020 MANUFACTURE OF CARBON FILAMENTS
AFTER THE REHEARSAL OF A SCENE HAS ADVANCED SUFFICIENTLY TO SUIT THE CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRODUCER THE CAMERA MAN IS IN REQUISITION AND HE IS CONSULTED AS TO LIGHTING SO AS TO PRODUCE THE REQUIRED PHOTOGRAPHIC EFFECT
A THIRD AND FOURTH FRIEND IN THE VICINITY WAS APPEALED TO WITH THE SAME DISHEARTENING REPLY OF A STORY OF WHOLESALE SPOLIATION
AND THIS HOUSE WITH ITS LIBERAL LINES SPACIOUS HALLS LOFTY CEILINGS WIDE PARLORS AND GRACEFUL WINDING STAIRWAY WAS IDEAL FOR THE PURPOSE
IN THE EARLY 80'S THE DRY PLATE WAS FIRST INTRODUCED INTO GENERAL USE AND FROM THAT TIME ONWARD ITS RAPIDITY AND QUALITY WERE GRADUALLY IMPROVED
AND THAT WHILE EACH RELAY MUST BE ABSOLUTELY UNRESPONSIVE TO THE SIGNALS SENT OUT FROM ITS HOME OFFICE IT MUST RESPOND TO SIGNALS TRANSMITTED BY A DISTANT OFFICE
THE PLACE WHICH HE SECURED FOR SETTING UP HIS TASIMETER WAS AN ENCLOSURE HARDLY SUITABLE FOR THE PURPOSE AND HE DESCRIBES THE RESULTS AS FOLLOWS
THE PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICAL SUBDIVISION
ALSO SAY TO HIM THAT I SHALL NOT ASK THEM TO MAKE THE AMOUNT GOOD THIS WAS DONE
AT BEST HE MERELY SIMULATES ANGER
THAT'S WHAT HE DID ON THE BATTERY FOR AFTER A WHOLE LOT OF WORK HE PERFECTED THE NICKEL-FLAKE IDEA AND PROCESS BESIDES MAKING THE GREAT IMPROVEMENT OF USING TUBES INSTEAD OF FLAT POCKETS FOR THE POSITIVE
VI
I SUPPOSE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DEATH
EDISON'S CONCEPTION OF THE WORKINGMAN'S IDEAL HOUSE HAS BEEN A BROAD ONE FROM THE VERY START
XI
BUT MOISTURE GOT IN BETWEEN THE COPPER RIBBON AND THE STEEL CORE SETTING UP GALVANIC ACTION WHICH MADE SHORT WORK OF THE STEEL
A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN EDISON HAD RECEIVED THE ALBERT MEDAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS ONE OF THE PRESENT AUTHORS CALLED AT THE LABORATORY TO SEE IT
AS WE HAVE NOTED IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER HOWEVER DELIVERIES OF THE PERFECTED TYPE WERE BEGUN IN THE SUMMER OF 1909 AND SINCE THAT TIME THE BUSINESS HAS CONTINUED TO GROW IN THE MEASURE INDICATED BY THE EARLIER EXPERIENCE
IN THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN OF OCTOBER 18 1879 THERE APPEARED AN ILLUSTRATED ARTICLE BY MR UPTON ON EDISON'S DYNAMO MACHINE IN WHICH EDISON'S VIEWS AND CLAIMS WERE SET FORTH
THEY WERE NOT LARGE--ABOUT TWELVE HORSE-POWER EACH--GENERATING SEVENTY-FIVE AMPERES OF CURRENT AT ONE HUNDRED AND TEN VOLTS SO THAT NOT QUITE TWENTY-FIVE HORSE-POWER OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY WAS AVAILABLE FOR PROPULSION
WHILST THE EDISON TELEPHONE COMPANY LASTED IT CROWDED THE BASEMENT OF A HIGH PILE OF OFFICES IN QUEEN VICTORIA STREET WITH AMERICAN ARTIFICERS
I HAD A NUMBER OF MEN SURVEY A STRIP REACHING FROM LOWER CANADA TO NORTH CAROLINA
HE CONSUMED HIS SHARE OF THE LUNCH WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE PLEASURE
AN IDEA OF THEIR COMPLEXITY MAY BE GATHERED FROM THE FOLLOWING WHICH IS QUOTED FROM AMERICAN TELEGRAPHY AND ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE TELEGRAPH BY WILLIAM MAVER JR
THERE AT ANY RATE HE FOUND HIS WIFE GRANDMOTHER ELLIOTT WHO WAS MERCY PECKHAM DAUGHTER OF A SCOTCH QUAKER
IT WAS A DIVERTING EXPERIENCE WHILE IT LASTED
THE STATION AT BERLIN COMPRISED FIVE BOILERS AND SIX VERTICAL STEAM-ENGINES DRIVING BY BELTS TWELVE EDISON DYNAMOS EACH OF ABOUT FIFTY-FIVE HORSE-POWER CAPACITY
I REMEMBER AS A COINCIDENCE THAT THE BUILDING WAS ONLY TWENTY FEET WIDE
AS THE READER KNOWS IT HAD BEEN A MASTER PASSION WITH EDISON FROM BOYHOOD UP TO POSSESS A LABORATORY IN WHICH WITH FREE USE OF HIS OWN TIME AND POWERS AND WITH COMMAND OF ABUNDANT MATERIAL RESOURCES HE COULD WRESTLE WITH NATURE AND PROBE HER CLOSEST SECRETS
BUT ONE FINE DAY THERE CAME AN EXCURSION FROM AN INLAND TOWN TO SEE THE LAKE
KRUESI GOT UP HIS FACE BLEEDING AND A GOOD DEAL SHAKEN
BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN DEEMED NECESSARY TO ENLARGE FURTHER UPON THE TECHNICAL MINUTIAE OF THE ART FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK
MR MOORE WHO WAS CONTINUING HIS SEARCHES IN THAT COUNTRY WAS INSTRUCTED TO ARRANGE FOR THE CULTIVATION AND SHIPMENT OF REGULAR SUPPLIES OF THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES
AFTER MAKING MANY MORE CHANGES IN THIS WHILE IN THE PATTERN SHOP HE PRODUCED A HOUSE SATISFACTORY TO HIMSELF
EDISON WAS HOW EVER ABOUT THE ONLY ONE IN BOSTON OF WHOM HISTORY MAKES RECORD AS ACHIEVING ANY TANGIBLE RESULT IN THIS NEW ART
IT WAS THE KIND THAT WE WERE GOING TO USE FOR OUR LAMP EXPERIMENTS
WELL GENERAL SUPPOSE YOU MAKE ME AN OFFER THEN HE SAID
MARCH 7 1881 251,553 ELECTRIC CHANDELIERS MARCH 7 1881 251,554 ELECTRIC LAMP AND SOCKET OR HOLDER MARCH 7 1881 248,424 FITTING AND FIXTURES FOR ELECTRIC LAMPS
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD RECEIVE I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE TIME AND KILLING PACE I WAS WORKING AT I SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO $5000 BUT COULD GET ALONG WITH $3000
A LARGE MARKET GARDEN WAS LAID OUT IN WHICH EDISON WORKED PRETTY STEADILY WITH THE HELP OF THE DUTCH BOY MICHAEL OATES--HE OF THE FLYING EXPERIMENT
SIR RICHARD WEBSTER NOW CHIEF-JUSTICE OF ENGLAND WAS MY COUNSEL AND SUSTAINED ALL OF MY PATENTS IN ENGLAND FOR MANY YEARS
BUT THE ABOVE ARE NOT BY ANY MEANS ALL THE FACTS RELATING TO INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTING IN THE UNITED STATES FOR IN ADDITION TO CENTRAL STATIONS THERE ARE UPWARD OF 100,000 ISOLATED OR PRIVATE PLANTS IN MILLS FACTORIES STEAMSHIPS HOTELS THEATRES ETC OWNED BY THE PERSONS OR CONCERNS WHO OPERATE THEM
AN ARTIFICIAL COMPOUND OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER HAS INDEED BEEN UNIVERSALLY ADOPTED FOR THE PURPOSE BY ALL MANUFACTURERS
THE COMPANY HAS IN THE DWELLING OF EDDISON MEN IN ITS EMPLOY WHO DO NOT QUIT HIM FOR A MOMENT AT THE TABLE ON THE STREET IN THE LABORATORY
AND IN THE INTERVENING YEARS THE VOLUME OF TRAFFIC CREATED AND HANDLED BY ELECTRICITY IN CENTRES OF DENSE POPULATION HAS BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE THE MODERN SUBWAY
637,327
THE CANAL WAS CAPABLE OF BEING NAVIGATED BY CRAFT OF FROM TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TONS BURDEN AND THE DEMAND FOR SUCH VESSELS SOON LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BRISK SHIP-BUILDING INDUSTRY FOR WHICH THE ABUNDANT FORESTS OF THE REGION SUPPLIED THE NECESSARY LUMBER
MANY YEARS AFTERWARD I USED THIS LITTLE DEVICE AGAIN FOR THE SAME PURPOSE
HE STOOD HIGH IN HIS CLASS AND THERE WERE OTHERS OF A DIFFERENT STRIPE
THE VERTICALS OF THESE LETTERS WERE ORIGINALLY FIVE HOLES HIGH
AND THEN SAYS ONE OF THE LABORATORY MEN WE STARTED ON ANOTHER SERIES OF RECORD-BREAKING EXPERIMENTS THAT LASTED OVER FIVE YEARS
THERE WERE A FEW MECHANICAL AND ENGINEERING ANNOYANCES THAT MIGHT NATURALLY BE EXPECTED TO ARISE IN A NEW AND UNPRECEDENTED ENTERPRISE
SIX COVERED INVENTIONS RELATING TO DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINES
AND DOWN TO THE PRESENT MOMENT THE PROCESS OF IMPROVEMENT HAS GONE ON IMPELLED BY THE INCREASING VOLUME OF BUSINESS TO BE REPORTED
THE DUTCH BOY WAS RELEASED NEXT MORNING CHAPTER IV THE YOUNG TELEGRAPH OPERATOR WHILE A NEWSBOY ON THE RAILROAD SAYS EDISON I GOT VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN ELECTRICITY PROBABLY FROM VISITING TELEGRAPH OFFICES WITH A CHUM WHO HAD TASTES SIMILAR TO MINE IT WILL ALSO HAVE BEEN NOTED THAT HE USED THE TELEGRAPH TO GET ITEMS FOR HIS LITTLE JOURNAL AND TO BULLETIN HIS SPECIAL NEWS OF THE CIVIL WAR ALONG THE LINE
AT THE SAME TIME OPERATORS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SHREWD ENOUGH TO REGARD THE TELEGRAPH AS A STEPPING-STONE TO OTHER CAREERS IN LIFE
IN FACT IN UNDERGOING THIS VIOLENT CHANGE IT DID NOT CEASE TO BE A HOME IN THE REAL SENSE FOR TO THIS DAY MANY AN EDISON VETERAN'S PULSE IS QUICKENED BY SOME CHANCE REFERENCE TO 65 WHERE THROUGH MANY YEARS THE WORK OF DEVELOPMENT BY A LOYAL AND DEVOTED BAND OF WORKERS WAS CENTRED
THE FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY WERE IN PANIC
IF SO HE WOULD SEND IT AND CLEVELAND WOULD REPEAT IT TO ALL OF US
AS USUAL I PAID FOR THE EXPERIMENT IN THE SPRING OF 1883 THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY COMPANY OF AMERICA WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITH A CAPITAL OF $2,000,000 TO DEVELOP THE PATENTS AND INVENTIONS OF EDISON AND STEPHEN D
THESE ARE AMONG THE REFINEMENTS OF PRACTICE COINCIDENTAL WITH THE ADVANCE OF THE ART
YOU SHOULD HAVE THESE MEN ON PROBATION AND SUBJECT TO PASSING AN EXAMINATION BY ME
CHAPTER XXI MOTION PICTURES THE PRECEDING CHAPTERS HAVE TREATED OF EDISON IN VARIOUS ASPECTS AS AN INVENTOR SOME OF WHICH ARE FAMILIAR TO THE PUBLIC OTHERS OF WHICH ARE BELIEVED TO BE IN THE NATURE OF A NOVEL REVELATION SIMPLY BECAUSE NO ONE HAD TAKEN THE TROUBLE BEFORE TO PUT THE FACTS TOGETHER
THE FARTHEST WESTERN REACH OF THE TELEGRAPH LINES IN 1847 WAS PITTSBURG WITH THREE-PLY IRON WIRE MOUNTED ON SQUARE GLASS INSULATORS WITH A LITTLE WOODEN PENTROOF FOR PROTECTION
THIS INSTRUMENT MANY YEARS AFTERWARD WAS APPLIED BY ME FOR TRANSFERRING MESSAGES FROM ONE WIRE TO ANY OTHER WIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY OR AFTER ANY INTERVAL OF TIME
ALL THE WAY UP HE HAS HAD DISCOURAGING EXPERIENCES
THE ENGINEER REMARKED THAT IT WAS TOO BAD FOR THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY TO DO IT
NEW YORK OFFICE HAD REPORTED GREAT DELAYS ON THE WIRE DUE TO OPERATORS CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTING OR BREAKING AS IT WAS CALLED TO HAVE WORDS REPEATED WHICH THEY HAD FAILED TO GET
AND THEN PUT IN A TWENTY-FOOT IRON PIPE
THESE RESULTED SO SATISFACTORILY THAT THIS FORM WAS FINALLY DECIDED UPON AND ULTIMATELY INSTALLED AS PART OF THE PLANT
THE SILENT DRAMA HOWEVER CALLS ALSO FOR MANY REPRESENTATIONS WHICH EMPLOY CONVENTIONAL ACTING STAGING AND THE VARIED APPLIANCES OF STAGECRAFT
THE ROAD TO YESTERDAY BACK TO EDISON AND HIS INSISTENCE ON UNDERGROUND WIRES IS A LONG ONE BUT THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH TRACES IT
MR PAINTER SENT THE LETTER ON TO MR BATCHELOR WHO TURNED IT OVER TO EDISON
THE METAL WAS THUS RESTORED TO CIRCULATION
HE DESCRIBES EDISON AS UNCOUTH IN MANNER A CHEWER RATHER THAN A SMOKER OF TOBACCO BUT FULL OF INTELLIGENCE AND IDEAS
HE ALSO ORIGINATED THE IDEA OF USING ONLY ONE INKING-PAD AND SHIFTING IT FROM SIDE TO SIDE TO INK THE TYPE-WHEELS
BY MEANS OF THE NEEDLE ATTACHED TO THE RECORDING DIAPHRAGM INDENTATIONS WERE MADE IN A SHEET OF TIN-FOIL STRETCHED OVER THE PERIPHERAL SURFACE OF THE CYLINDER WHEN THE DIAPHRAGM WAS VIBRATED BY REASON OF SPEECH OR OTHER SOUNDS
WE GATHERED UP A COUPLE OF SOUNDERS A BATTERY AND SONIC WIRE AND AT THE APPOINTED TIME CALLED ON HER TO DO THE STUNT
BESIDES THESE THERE ARE THE JOURNALS AND PROCEEDINGS OF NUMEROUS TECHNICAL SOCIETIES
AS WILL BE SEEN FROM THE DIAGRAM THE ARMATURE A OF THE TYPE-MAGNET HAS AN EXTENSION ARM ON THE END OF WHICH IS AN ESCAPEMENT ENGAGING WITH A TOOTHED WHEEL PLACED AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE SHAFT CARRYING THE TYPE-WHEELS
NEW TOOLS WERE MADE AND VARIOUS TYPES OF MACHINES WERE DESIGNED SO THAT PHONOGRAPHS CAN NOW BE BOUGHT AT PRICES RANGING FROM $10 TO $200
THE READER HAS ALREADY LEARNED THAT HIS ENTRY INTO THIS FIELD WAS IN A MANNER ACCIDENTAL ALTHOUGH LOGICALLY IN LINE WITH PRONOUNCED CONVICTIONS OF MANY YEARS STANDING AND FOLLOWING UP THE FUND OF KNOWLEDGE GAINED IN THE MAGNETIC ORE-MILLING BUSINESS
THE DETECTION OF SMALL VARIATIONS OF TEMPERATURES IS BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH THE CHANGES WHICH HEAT OR COLD WILL PRODUCE IN A SENSITIVE MATERIAL PLACED IN CONTACT WITH A CARBON BUTTON WHICH IS PUT IN CIRCUIT WITH A BATTERY AND DELICATE GALVANOMETER
THE OFFICIAL DEMONSTRATION TRIP ON THIS ROAD TOOK PLACE ON OCTOBER 6 1887 ON A SIX-CAR TRAIN RUNNING TO EASTON PENNSYLVANIA A DISTANCE OF FIFTY-FOUR MILES
IT WAS AS IF THE GATES OF THE INFERNAL REGIONS HAD BEEN SUDDENLY OPENED THIS TROUBLE WAS AT ONCE ATTACKED BY EDISON IN HIS CHARACTERISTIC AND STRENUOUS WAY
OF COURSE I DISCOVERED THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS THAT ONE SET WAS RUNNING THE OTHER AS A MOTOR
THE COLONEL WAS ALWAYS RESOURCEFUL AND DIDN'T FAIL IN THIS CASE
AT ONE TIME THERE WERE A NUMBER OF STORAGE-BATTERY LINES AND CARS IN OPERATION IN SUCH CITIES AS WASHINGTON NEW YORK CHICAGO AND BOSTON
IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THERE HAS BEEN GIVEN A DESCRIPTION OF THE GIANT ROLLS BY MEANS OF WHICH GREAT MASSES OF ROCK OF WHICH INDIVIDUAL PIECES MAY WEIGH EIGHT OR MORE TONS ARE BROKEN AND REDUCED TO ABOUT A FOURTEEN-INCH SIZE
I SUCCEEDED IN CLOSING THE OIL-CUP AND GOT BACK IN THE CAB AND MADE UP MY MIND THAT SHE WOULD PULL THROUGH WITHOUT OIL
THIS IS PERHAPS THE RIGHT PLACE AT WHICH TO REFER TO THE MATTER AS IT BELONGS IN THE LIST OF HIS FINANCIAL OR COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES
THAT'S A GREAT PLACE
HE HAD THE FACULTY OF UNDERSTANDING AND QUICKLY SEEING THE POINT OF THE STORIES
WE WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO GET INTO A PRINTING ESTABLISHMENT
FROM AUGUST 1877 THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY WORKED ALONG THE OTHER LINE AND IN 1878 WITH ITS ALLIED GOLD STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY IT BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE THE AMERICAN SPEAKING TELEPHONE COMPANY TO INTRODUCE THE EDISON APPARATUS AND TO CREATE TELEPHONE EXCHANGES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
IT WAS THERE THAT MR NIKOLA TESLA MADE HIS ENTREE INTO THE FIELD OF LIGHT AND POWER AND BEGAN HIS OWN CAREER AS AN INVENTOR
THE NEWSPAPERS HAD PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED ARTICLES SHOWING THE UNUSUAL CAPACITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE BATTERY AND PUBLIC INTEREST HAD THUS BEEN GREATLY AWAKENED
LEARNING THAT THE CHIEF OPERATOR WHO WAS A PROTEGE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT WAS TRYING IN SOME WAY TO PUT NEW YORK AND NEW ORLEANS TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE WAR I REDOUBLED MY EFFORTS AND AT 2 O'CLOCK ONE MORNING I HAD THEM SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER
WITH A QUIZZICAL GLEAM IN HIS EYE HE SAID
WHEN I WAS LAYING TUBES IN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK THE OFFICE RECEIVED NOTICE FROM THE COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS TO APPEAR AT HIS OFFICE AT A CERTAIN HOUR
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HE NEVER UNTIL LONG PAST FIFTY KNEW OR PRACTICED THE SLIGHTEST MODERATION IN WORK OR IN THE USE OF STRONG COFFEE AND BLACK CIGARS
HELL THE TRAIN DISPATCHER ON THE STRENGTH OF MY MESSAGE THAT I WOULD HOLD THE TRAIN HAD PERMITTED ANOTHER TO LEAVE THE LAST STATION IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
26 1886 484,184 MANUFACTURE OF CARBON FILAMENTS
I RUSHED TO A SINK WHICH WAS ONLY HALF BIG ENOUGH AND GOT IN AS WELL AS I COULD AND WIGGLED AROUND FOR SEVERAL MINUTES TO PERMIT THE WATER TO DILUTE THE ACID AND STOP THE PAIN
158,787 ISSUED JANUARY 19 1875 BY THE SUBSTITUTION OF FRICTION AND ANTI-FRICTION FOR THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF MAGNETISM IN A REGULATION RELAY
13 1909 FOREIGN PATENTS IN ADDITION TO THE UNITED STATES PATENTS ISSUED TO EDISON AS ABOVE ENUMERATED THERE HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO HIM UP TO OCTOBER 1910 BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS 1239 PATENTS AS FOLLOWS
THE PROBLEM INCLUDED HANDLING AND CRUSHING THE RUN OF THE MINE WITHOUT SELECTION
EDISON FOUND THAT UNDER THE WORST CONDITIONS WITH A WET AND SALTED TRACK AT A POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE OF TWENTY VOLTS BETWEEN THE TWO RAILS THE EXTREME LOSS WAS ONLY TWO AND ONE-HALF HORSE-POWER
THIS HE AD ACQUIRED BY THE HARDEST KIND OF WORK AND INCESSANT EXPERIMENT WITH MAGNETS OF ALL KINDS DURING SEVERAL YEARS PRECEDING PARTICULARLY IN CONNECTION WITH HIS STUDY OF AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHY
NO DIMINUTION OF DAILY WORK OR INCREASE OF DAILY COMFORT COULD BE SECURED WITH IT
HE WAS RESPECTED WITH A RESPECT WHICH ONLY GREAT MEN CAN OBTAIN AND HE NEVER SHOWED BY ANY WORD OR ACT THAT HE WAS THEIR EMPLOYER IN A SENSE THAT WOULD HURT THE FEELINGS AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS LIFE
THUS
HE USED NO MATHEMATICS
IN FACT SO PLAIN THAT AT THE BERGMANN SHOPS IN NEW YORK THE CHILDREN ATTENDING A PAROCHIAL CATHOLIC SCHOOL WERE WONT TO SALUTE HIM WITH THE FINGER TO THE HEAD EVERY TIME HE WENT BY
SUCH ECONOMY OF OUTLAY BEING EFFECTED IN ONE OF THE HEAVIEST ITEMS OF EXPENSE IN CENTRAL-STATION CONSTRUCTION IT WAS NOW MADE POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH PLANTS IN TOWNS WHERE THE LARGE INVESTMENT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN QUITE PROHIBITIVE
HE IS VERY ABSTEMIOUS HARDLY EVER TOUCHING ALCOHOL CARING LITTLE FOR MEAT BUT FOND OF FRUIT AND NEVER AVERSE TO A STRONG CUP OF COFFEE OR A GOOD CIGAR
THEIR RESPECTIVE METHODS MIGHT BE DISSIMILAR WHILE TENDING TO THE SAME END BUT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY FOLLOW THAT ANY ONE OF THESE OTHER EXPERIMENTERS MIGHT EVER HAVE ACHIEVED THE RESULT AIMED AT ALTHOUGH AFTER THE PROCLAMATION OF SUCCESS BY ONE IT IS EASY TO BELIEVE THAT EACH OF THE OTHER INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATORS MIGHT READILY PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE REACHED THE GOAL IN JUST THAT SAME WAY
WHEN A MESSAGE IS TO BE RECEIVED ON THE CAR FROM A STATION MORE OR LESS REMOTE THE SWITCH IS THROWN TO THE LEFT TO CONNECT WITH A WIRE RUNNING TO THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER T
BUT SOON THIS RUNNING OF THE HORSE BECAME MONOTONOUS AND AFTER A WHILE ALL FEARS OF GRAVEYARDS ABSOLUTELY DISAPPEARED FROM MY SYSTEM
AT THE PRESENT WRITING THE PLANT COVERS ABOUT SEVEN ACRES OF GROUND
IN THE PATIENT SOLVING OF TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS HE HAD TOILED UP THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE OF SUCCESS--SCALING ITS TOPMOST PEAK AND OBTAINING A VIEW OF THE BOUNDLESS PROSPECT
THIS WAS BY ACTUAL COUNT AS TO THE SHOPS AND THE LOCALITY
HAVING WHILE IN TYLER'S OFFICE HEARD THEM ARGUING ON THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL ETC I ASKED PERMISSION OF MR TYLER IF AFTER FINISHING THE PRESS MATTER I MIGHT COME IN AND LISTEN TO THE CONVERSATION WHICH I DID MANY TIMES AFTER
IN PRACTICE HOWEVER WHERE GREAT NUMBERS OF LAMPS ARE IN USE AS FOR INSTANCE IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE ABOUT 7,000,000 LAMPS ARE OPERATED FROM VARIOUS CENTRAL STATIONS THERE IS CONSTANTLY OCCURRING MORE OR LESS CHANGE IN THE BALANCE OF MANY CIRCUITS EXTENDING OVER CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES BUT OF COURSE THERE IS A NET RESULT WHICH IS ALWAYS ON ONE SIDE OF THE SYSTEM OR THE OTHER FOR THE TIME BEING AND THIS IS MET BY PROPER ADJUSTMENT AT THE APPROPRIATE GENERATOR IN THE STATION
WE HAD TO BANK THE TRACKS UP TO AN ANGLE OF THIRTY DEGREES BEFORE WE COULD TURN THE CURVE AND STAY ON

AND THAT IN SUCH WAYS HE HAS SUFFERED DIRECTLY
ALTHOUGH THE ELECTRIC PEN HAD A LARGE SALE AND USE IN ITS TIME THE STATISTICS RELATING TO IT ARE NOT AVAILABLE
THE SWITCHBOARD FOR MANIPULATING THE WIRES WAS ABOUT THIRTY-FOUR INCHES SQUARE
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS REQUIRES THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE FIVE INSPECTORS TO LOOK AFTER THIS WORK AND THAT THEIR SALARY SHALL BE $5 PER DAY PAYABLE AT THE END OF EACH WEEK
MOORE WHO WAS THE FIRST GENERAL MANAGER OF THE EDISON COMPANY FOR ISOLATED LIGHTING AS A DRAFTSMAN TO UNDERTAKE THE WORK OF DESIGNING AND BUILDING EDISON'S ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE NO
AFTER YOU CAN GO NO FURTHER DISTIL OFF ALL THE SOLVENTS SO THE ASPHALT MATERIAL HAS A TAR-LIKE CONSISTENCY

THE COPPER KEPT THE TEMPERATURE DOWN SO THAT IT COULD ONLY EXPLODE UP TO THE POINT WHERE IT WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE FEED ROLLS
IMMEDIATELY ABOVE ON THE SECOND FLOOR IS FOUND ANOTHER MACHINE SHOP IN WHICH IS MAINTAINED A CORPS OF EXPERT MECHANICS WHO ARE CALLED UPON TO DO WORK OF GREATER PRECISION AND FINENESS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF TOOLS AND EXPERIMENTAL MODELS
AT THE PRESENT WRITING IT IS USED AS A GENERAL STOCK-ROOM
SINCE THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATED BY HAND THE SPEED AT WHICH THE RECORD WAS FORMED WOULD VARY CONSIDERABLY EVEN WITH THE SAME MANIPULATOR SO THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO RECORD AND REPRODUCE MUSIC SATISFACTORILY
I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO REVERSE AN UNSUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT AND COME OUT ALL RIGHT TO FOLLOW EDISON'S TRAIL IN DETAIL THROUGH THE INNUMERABLE TWISTS AND TURNS OF HIS EXPERIMENTATION AND RESEARCH ON THE STORAGE BATTERY DURING THE PAST TEN YEARS WOULD NOT BE IN KEEPING WITH THE SCOPE OF THIS NARRATIVE NOR WOULD IT SERVE ANY USEFUL PURPOSE
MR EDISON HIMSELF SUPPLIES THE FOLLOWING DATA
CLEVELAND WAS THE ORIGINATING OFFICE FOR PRESS WHICH IT RECEIVED FROM NEW YORK AND SENT IT OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY TO MILWAUKEE CHICAGO TOLEDO DETROIT PITTSBURG COLUMBUS DAYTON CINCINNATI INDIANAPOLIS VINCENNES TERRE HAUTE ST LOUIS AND LOUISVILLE
JUNE 3 1882 264,651 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
ONE OF THE STORIES OF THE DAY WAS THAT EDISON HAD HIS FRONT GATE SO CONNECTED WITH THE PUMPING PLANT THAT EVERY VISITOR AS HE OPENED OR CLOSED THE GATE ADDED INVOLUNTARILY TO THE SUPPLY IN THE RESERVOIR
BOOTH WAS HURRIED AWAY INTO SECLUSION AND THE NEXT MORNING THE CITY THAT HAD BEEN SO GAY OVER NIGHT WITH BUNTING WAS DRAPED WITH MOURNING
ON REACHING THE MANAGER'S OFFICE HIS TRIAL FOR NEGLECT OF DUTY WAS FORTUNATELY INTERRUPTED BY THE CALL OF TWO ENGLISHMEN

A FEW YEARS AGO A CONSUMPTION OF 3.1 WATTS PER CANDLE-POWER MIGHT SAFELY BE ASSUMED AS AN EXCELLENT AVERAGE AND MANY STATIONS FIXED THEIR RATES AND BUSINESS ON SUCH A BASIS
HENCE IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT VIGILANCE TO DEFEAT THE INSIDIOUS ATTACKS OF CARPING CRITICS AND OTHERS WHO WOULD ATTEMPT TO INJURE THE EDISON SYSTEM BY MISLEADING STATEMENTS
A BATTERY EMBODYING THIS BASIC PRINCIPLE WILL HAVE FEATURES OF GREAT VALUE WHERE LIGHTNESS AND DURABILITY ARE DESIDERATA

THE PULSATIONS OF CURRENT PASSED THROUGH THE HELICES OF THESE MAGNETS PRODUCING AN AUGMENTED MARKING EFFECT UPON THE RECEIVING TAPE BUT UPON THE BREAKING OF THE CURRENT THE MAGNET IN DISCHARGING ITSELF OF THE INDUCED MAGNETISM WOULD SET UP MOMENTARILY A COUNTER-CURRENT OF OPPOSITE POLARITY
THE TRANSFER WAS POSSIBLY DUE TO TROUBLE CAUSED BY ONE OF HIS EARLY INVENTIONS EMBODYING WHAT HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY AN EXPERT AS PROBABLY THE MOST SIMPLE AND INGENIOUS ARRANGEMENT OF CONNECTIONS FOR A REPEATER HIS AMBITION WAS TO TAKE PRESS REPORT BUT FINDING EVEN AFTER CONSIDERABLE PRACTICE THAT HE BROKE FREQUENTLY HE ADJUSTED TWO EMBOSSING MORSE REGISTERS--ONE TO RECEIVE THE PRESS MATTER AND THE OTHER TO REPEAT THE DOTS AND DASHES AT A LOWER SPEED SO THAT THE MESSAGE COULD BE COPIED LEISURELY
THE PICTURE OF EDISON IS AS VIVID TO ME NOW AS IF THE INCIDENT OCCURRED YESTERDAY ALTHOUGH IT IS NOW MORE THAN TWENTY-NINE YEARS SINCE THAT FIRST MEETING

IT WAS OF SUCH RICH CHARACTER THAT BEING CHEAPLY MINED BY GREATLY IMPROVED AND INEXPENSIVE METHODS THE MARKET PRICE OF CRUDE ORE OF LIKE IRON UNITS FELL FROM ABOUT $6.50 TO $3.50 PER TON AT THE TIME WHEN EDISON WAS READY TO SUPPLY HIS CONCENTRATED PRODUCT
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT EDISON'S SCRAP-HEAP CONTAINS THE ELEMENTS OF A LIBERAL EDUCATION AND THIS WAS ESSENTIALLY TRUE OF THE DISCARD DURING THE ORE-MILLING EXPERIENCE
THE BUILDING WAS EQUIPPED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE STRIKING OF THE FIRE-ALARM WOULD LIGHT EVERY LAMP IN THE HOUSE AUTOMATICALLY AND LIBERATE THE HORSES

THE FEW SPECIFIC INSTANCES ABOVE RELATED ALTHOUGH NOT REPRESENTING A TITHE OF EDISON'S WORK WILL PROBABLY BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE READER TO APPRECIATE TO SOME EXTENT HIS GREAT WEALTH OF IDEAS AND FERTILITY OF IMAGINATION AND ALSO TO REALIZE THAT THIS IMAGINATION IS NOT ONLY INTENSELY PRACTICAL BUT THAT IT WORKS PROPHETICALLY ALONG LINES OF NATURAL PROGRESS

BUT HAVING FOUND IN THE MALAY PENINSULA AND IN CEYLON A BAMBOO FIBRE WHICH AVERAGED A TEST FROM ONE TO TWO HUNDRED PER CENT
THE BULLETIN WAS CARRIED ON FOR SOME YEARS UNTIL ITS NECESSITY WAS REMOVED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR REACHING THE PUBLIC
THE NEXT RESORT OF EDISON WAS TO BELTS THE ARMATURE SHAFTING BELTED TO A COUNTERSHAFT ON THE LOCOMOTIVE FRAME AND THE COUNTERSHAFT BELTED TO A PULLEY ON THE CAR-AXLE
THE RESULTS WERE SO FOREIGN TO HIS EXPERIENCE THAT HE KNEW THERE WAS A TRICK IN IT
BUT MR ORTON WENT ON AN EXTENDED TOUR JUST ABOUT THAT TIME
WHEN THIS WAS DONE I KNEW THAT EVERYTHING ELSE COULD BE DONE WHICH WAS A FACT
CHEAP TO BUILD AND CHEAP TO MAINTAIN SUCH ROADS WOULD BE A GREAT BOON TO THE NEWER FARMING REGIONS OF THE WEST WHERE THE HIGHWAYS WERE STILL OF THE CRUDEST CHARACTER AND WHERE TRANSPORTATION WAS THE GRAVEST DIFFICULTY WITH WHICH THE SETTLERS HAD TO CONTEND

THE INCANDESCENT LAMP ALTHOUGH EDISON'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO HUMAN COMFORT AND PROGRESS ARE EXTENSIVE IN NUMBER AND EXTRAORDINARILY VAST AND COMPREHENSIVE IN SCOPE AND VARIETY THE UNIVERSAL VERDICT OF THE WORLD POINTS TO HIS INCANDESCENT LAMP AND SYSTEM OF DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRICAL CURRENT AS THE CENTRAL AND CROWNING ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS LIFE UP TO THIS TIME
THIS WAS THE RESULT OF THE SUCCESS OBTAINED WITH SMALL ISOLATED PLANTS LEADING TO THE FORMATION OF AN EDISON COMPANY
ONE OF THEM IN SPEAKING OF THE SEEMINGLY INTERMINABLE EXPERIMENTS TO OVERCOME THIS TROUBLE SAID
BUT THE COSTS OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE WERE FOUND TO BE INORDINATELY HIGH AS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE DIRECT-SUPPLY METHODS AND THE BATTERY CARS ALL DISAPPEARED
THE LINE WAS MADE TO WORK HOWEVER AND ADDITIONAL TO THE MESSAGES THAT THE BOYS INTERCHANGED EDISON SECURED PRACTICE IN AN INGENIOUS MANNER
THE CONTRACT WAS NEVER COMPLETED SO FAR AS THE $4,000,000 WERE CONCERNED BUT GOULD MADE GOOD USE OF IT IN GETTING CONTROL OF THE WESTERN UNION ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSONS CONNECTED WITH THE AUTOMATIC ENTERPRISE WAS MR GEORGE HARRINGTON TO WHOM WE HAVE ABOVE REFERRED AND WITH WHOM MR EDISON ENTERED INTO CLOSE CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONS SO THAT THE INVENTIONS MADE WERE HELD JOINTLY UNDER A PARTNERSHIP DEED COVERING ANY INVENTIONS OR IMPROVEMENTS THAT MAY BE USEFUL OR DESIRED IN AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHY MR HARRINGTON WAS ASSURED AT THE OUTSET BY EDISON THAT WHILE THE LITTLE PERFORATOR WOULD GIVE ON THE AVERAGE ONLY SEVEN OR EIGHT WORDS PER MINUTE WHICH WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES HE COULD DEVISE ONE GIVING FIFTY OR SIXTY WORDS AND THAT WHILE THE LITTLE SOLUTION FOR THE RECEIVING TAPE COST $15 TO $17 PER GALLON HE COULD FURNISH A FERRIC SOLUTION COSTING ONLY FIVE OR SIX CENTS PER GALLON
IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE DIFFICULTY LAY IN THE MATERIAL OF THE BURNER ITSELF AND NOT IN ITS ENVIRONMENT
THE OLD CAPTAIN WAS A FINE AND PICTURESQUE TYPE

PROCEEDING DAY BY DAY AS APPEARS BY THIS SAME BOOK HE FOLLOWS UP ANOTHER LINE OF INVESTIGATION ON LAMPS APPARENTLY FULL OF DIFFICULTY FOR AFTER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-TWO OTHER RECORDED EXPERIMENTS WE FIND THIS NOTE
ONCE MORE QUOTING EDISON ON THIS SUBJECT
HE RECEIVED AN IMPRESSION DOUBTLESS
I SET UP AN EXCHANGE AROUND THE LABORATORY OF TEN INSTRUMENTS
HIS SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM WAS SIMPLE BUT EFFECTUAL
THE PRACTICAL RESULT IN THE PEARL STREET STATION HAS FULLY DEMONSTRATED THE CORRECTNESS OF OUR ESTIMATE THUS MADE IN ADVANCE
IT WAS FOUR STORIES HIGH WITH A FIRE-WALL DIVIDING IT INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS
I HAVE JUST RECEIVED THE PAID CHECKS FROM THE BANK AND I AM FEARFUL THAT MY ASSISTANT WHO HAS FORGED MY NAME TO SOME OF THE CHECKS HAS ABSCONDED WITH ABOUT $3000 I WENT IMMEDIATELY TO MR EDISON AND TOLD HIM OF THE FORGERY AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TAKEN AND IN WHAT AN EMBARRASSING POSITION WE WERE FOR THE NEXT PAY-ROLL
SO IT ALSO IS IN REGARD TO THE MIMEOGRAPH WHOSE FORERUNNER THE ELECTRIC PEN WAS BORN OF EDISON'S BRAIN IN 1877

BUT THESE FEW APPLIANCES MADE UP THE MEAGRE KIT OF TOOLS WITH WHICH THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ENTERED UPON ITS TASK OF ACQUIRING THE ARTS AND CONVENIENCES NOW SUCH AN INTIMATE PART OF HUMAN NATURE'S DAILY FOOD THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN TO-DAY PAYS MORE FOR HIS ELECTRICAL SERVICE THAN HE DOES FOR BREAD
WELL HE SAID TO ME EDISON YOU ARE DOING A GOOD THING FOR THE EASTERN FURNACES
HE WAS DISCHARGED WHEREUPON THE UNION NOTIFIED US THAT UNLESS THE BOY WAS TAKEN BACK THE WHOLE BODY WOULD GO OUT
THE BERLINER PATENT WAS DECLARED INVALID AND IN THE COURSE OF A LONG AND EXHAUSTIVE OPINION IN WHICH THE STATE OF ART AND THE WORK OF BELL EDISON BERLINER AND OTHERS WAS FULLY DISCUSSED THE LEARNED JUDGE MADE THE FOLLOWING REMARKS
HE DID NOT WANT HIS CUSTOMERS TO COUNT THE HEART-BEATS OF THE ENGINE IN THE FLICKER OF THE LAMP
IT WORKED IN THE SAME WAY AS AN ORDINARY COUNTER
NOT ONLY HAS HE DEVELOPED DISTINCTLY NEW SPECIES BUT HE HAS ELUCIDATED THE INTENSIVE ART OF GETTING $1200 OUT OF AN ELECTRICAL ACRE INSTEAD OF $12--A MANURED MARKET-GARDEN INSIDE LONDON AND A TEN-BUSHEL EXHAUSTED WHEAT FARM OUTSIDE LAWRENCE KANSAS BEING THE ANTIPODES OF PRODUCTIVITY--YET VERY FAR SHORT OF EXEMPLIFYING THE DIFFERENCE OF ELECTRICAL YIELD BETWEEN AN ACRE OF TERRITORY IN EDISON'S FIRST NEW YORK DISTRICT AND AN ACRE IN SOME SMALL TOWN
ITS VIBRATIONS WERE BROKEN BY MEANS OF A KEY INTO LONG AND SHORT PERIODS REPRESENTING MORSE CHARACTERS WHICH WERE TRANSMITTED INDUCTIVELY FROM THE TRAIN CIRCUIT TO THE POLE LINE OR VICE VERSA AND RECEIVED BY THE OPERATOR AT THE OTHER END THROUGH A HIGH-RESISTANCE TELEPHONE RECEIVER INSERTED IN THE SECONDARY CIRCUIT OF THE INDUCTION-COIL ALTHOUGH THE SPACE BETWEEN THE CARS AND THE POLE LINE WAS PROBABLY NOT MORE THAN ABOUT FIFTY FEET IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT IN EDISON'S EARLY EXPERIMENTS AT MENLO PARK HE SUCCEEDED IN TRANSMITTING MESSAGES THROUGH THE AIR AT A DISTANCE OF 580 FEET
THESE PATENTS MAY BE ROUGHLY TABULATED AS FOLLOWS
THIS EARNED HIM THE GRATITUDE OF THE EDITORS A DINNER AND ALL THE NEWSPAPER EXCHANGES HE WANTED
LET SOME ONE ELSE DO IT HE SAID
WE STARTED IN LOWER CANADA AND TRAVELLED ACROSS THE LINE OF MARCH TWENTY-FIVE MILES
ONE INSTANCE OF THE OPTIMISTIC VAGARIES WHICH LED HIM INCESSANTLY TO SPEND TIME AND MONEY ON PROJECTS THAT WOULD NOT HAVE APPEALED TO A MAN LESS SANGUINE WAS THE CONSTRUCTION ON HIS PROPERTY OF A WOODEN OBSERVATION TOWER OVER A HUNDRED FEET HIGH THE TOP OF WHICH WAS REACHED TOILSOMELY BY WINDING STAIRS AFTER THE PAYMENT OF TWENTY-FIVE CENTS
BE QUICK I REMOVED THE SPRING AND SET THE CONTACT WHEELS AT ZERO
IF HE HAD ASKED UPTON AT THE TIME TO FORMULATE THE RESULTS OF HIS WORK IN THIS DIRECTION FOR PUBLICATION HE WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED THE HISTORIC WORK ON MAGNETISM THAT WAS EXECUTED BY THE TWO OTHER INVESTIGATORS
THUS WE FIND MANY HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF THE NOTE-BOOKS COVERED WITH COMPUTATIONS AND CALCULATIONS BY MR UPTON NOT ONLY ON THE NUMEROUS RAMIFICATIONS OF THE PROJECTED SYSTEM AND COMPARISONS WITH GAS BUT ALSO ON PROPOSED FORMS OF DYNAMOS AND THE PROPOSED STATION IN NEW YORK
HE WAS VERY CHIPPER AND SEEMED TO BE LIGHT-HEARTED AND HAPPY
I HAD SO PERFECTED THE MACHINERY IN TRYING TO GET MY ORE COSTS DOWN THAT THE MAKING OF CHEAP CEMENT WAS AN EASY MATTER TO ME
HE RECALLS IN PARTICULAR THE SENSATION CAUSED BY THE GREAT BATTLE OF SHILOH OR PITTSBURG LANDING IN APRIL 1862 IN WHICH BOTH GRANT AND SHERMAN WERE ENGAGED IN WHICH JOHNSTON DIED AND IN WHICH THERE WAS A GHASTLY TOTAL OF 25,000 KILLED AND WOUNDED
THE WORST USE OF MONEY IS TO MAKE A FINE THOROUGHFARE AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO HORSES
THAT SYSTEM IS ON THE NEW YORK CENTRAL NOW AND WAS ALSO USED ON THE NEW HAVEN ROAD IN ITS FIRST WORK WITH ELECTRICITY AT THIS POINT IT MAY BE WELL TO CITE SOME OTHER STATEMENTS OF EDISON AS TO KINDRED WORK WITH WHICH HE HAS NOT USUALLY BEEN ASSOCIATED IN THE PUBLIC MIND
THESE PLANTS REPRESENT AN APPROXIMATE INVESTMENT OF $500,000,000 AND THE CONNECTION OF NOT LESS THAN 25,000,000 INCANDESCENT LAMPS OR THEIR EQUIVALENT
ON THE OTHER HAND THE WHEEL W HAS THE FULL NUMBER OF CONTACT SURFACES BECAUSE IT MUST PROVIDE FOR THE OPERATIVE CLOSURE OF THE PRESS-MAGNET CIRCUIT WHETHER THE BRUSH B IS IN ENGAGEMENT WITH A METALLIC SEGMENT OR AN INSULATED SEGMENT OF THE WHEEL W AS THE CYLINDER REVOLVES THE WHEELS ARE CARRIED AROUND WITH ITS SHAFT AND CURRENT IMPULSES FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MAGNETS AS THE BRUSHES MAKE CONTACT WITH THE METALLIC SEGMENTS OF THESE WHEELS
THE CARBON BEING ONLY SLIGHTLY COMPRESSED WILL OFFER CONSIDERABLE RESISTANCE TO THE FLOW OF CURRENT FROM THE LOCAL BATTERY AND THEREFORE THE SIGNAL ON THE LOCAL SOUNDER WILL BE WEAK
BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM
IT IS BELIEVED THAT ENOUGH EVIDENCE HAS BEEN GIVEN IN THIS CHAPTER TO LEAD TO AN APPRECIATION OF THE ASSIDUOUS WORK AND PRACTICAL SKILL INVOLVED IN INVENTING A SYSTEM OF LIGHTING THAT WOULD SURPASS AND TO A GREAT EXTENT IN ONE SINGLE QUARTER OF A CENTURY SUPERSEDE ALL THE OTHER METHODS OF ILLUMINATION DEVELOPED DURING LONG CENTURIES
THE OPERATION WAS REPEATED TWO OR THREE TIMES WITH ABOUT THE SAME RESULTS AFTER WHICH THE PARTY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO CATCH THE TRAIN FOR NEW YORK SUCH AN EXHIBITION WAS DECIDEDLY DISCOURAGING AND IT WAS NOT A JUBILANT PARTY THAT RETURNED TO NEW YORK BUT
THIS REDUCED TO A PATENT CLAIM GOVERNED THE ART AS FIRMLY AS A PAPAL BULL FOR CENTURIES ENABLED SPAIN TO HOLD THE WESTERN WORLD
IT SEEMED A PRETTY HARD JOB BECAUSE THERE WAS NO KNOWN MEANS OF MOVING A LEVER AT THE OTHER END OF A TELEGRAPH WIRE EXCEPT BY THE USE OF A MAGNET
THIS ANIMAL STRUCK THE FRONT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE JUST UNDER THE HEADLIGHT WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND WAS THEN THROWN OFF BY THE REBOUND
BUT HERE WAS SOMETHING THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF NO WONDER THAT HONEST JOHN KRUESI AS HE STOOD AND LISTENED TO THE MARVELLOUS PERFORMANCE OF THE SIMPLE LITTLE MACHINE HE HAD HIMSELF JUST FINISHED EJACULATED IN AN AWE-STRICKEN TONE
AND HAD A DEEP REVERENCE FOR ONE WHOSE POCKET COULD BE TAPPED BY RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR
IT IS NOT EASY TO APPRECIATE TO THE FULL THE DARING EXEMPLIFIED IN THESE GREAT CRUSHING ROLLS OR RATHER ROCK-CRACKERS WITHOUT HAVING WATCHED THEM IN OPERATION DELIVERING THEIR SOLAR-PLEXUS BLOWS

EDISON HAD NOW BEGUN UNCONSCIOUSLY THE ROAMING AND DRIFTING THAT TOOK HIM DURING THE NEXT FIVE YEARS ALL OVER THE MIDDLE STATES AND THAT MIGHT WELL HAVE WRECKED THE CAREER OF ANY ONE LESS PERSISTENT AND INDUSTRIOUS
THE DISTRIBUTION MAINS WERE TO BE OF SUFFICIENTLY LARGE SIZE THAT BETWEEN THEIR MOST EXTREME POINTS THE LOSS WOULD NOT BE MORE THAN 3 VOLTS
I LEARNED AFTERWARD THAT HE GOT A JOB THERE AND THEN WITHIN A WEEK THEY HAD A TELEGRAPHERS STRIKE
I RECEIVED A RATHER SHARP LETTER FROM THE NEW YORK OFFICE EXPOSTULATING FOR THIS EXTRAVAGANT EXPENDITURE AND STATING THAT GREAT ECONOMY MUST BE OBSERVED IN FUTURE THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE-LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS
HIS OFFICE WAS FILLED WITH STACKS OF BOOKS ALL RELATING TO METAPHYSICS AND KINDRED MATTERS
ALTHOUGH THE PATENT FOR THIS BASED ON HIS CAVEAT OF 1879 WAS GRANTED SEVERAL YEARS LATER THAN THAT TO STEPHEN D
PREVIOUS TO THAT TIME I HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT OF GRANT LOCOMOTIVE WORKS PATERSON NEW JERSEY AND THE RHODE ISLAND LOCOMOTIVE WORKS PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND
I MADE SIX OF THESE RECEIVERS AND SENT THEM IN CHARGE OF AN EXPERT ON THE FIRST STEAMER
STANTON WHEN I WAS WORKING IN CINCINNATI LEFT HIS POSITION AND WENT OUT ON THE UNION PACIFIC TO WORK AT JULESBURG WHICH WAS A CATTLE TOWN AT THAT TIME AND VERY TOUGH
MR D
HE HAD LEARNED THAT INVENTORS DIDN'T DO BUSINESS BY THE REGULAR PROCESS AND CONCLUDED HE WOULD CLOSE IT RIGHT UP
I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND YOUNG FELLOW THAT MY LIMIT IS $60 AFTER CHINNOCK HAD HAD ALL THIS TROUBLE DUE TO THE INCOMPETENCY OF THE PREVIOUS SUPERINTENDENT A MAN CAME IN AND SAID TO HIM
AND IN THIS MANNER THE RESISTANCE OF A CIRCUIT CAN BE VARIED OVER A WIDE RANGE
IN VIEW OF EDISON'S DUTCH DESCENT IT IS RATHER SINGULAR TO FIND HIM WITH THE NAME OF ALVA FOR THE SPANISH DUKE OF ALVA WAS NOTORIOUSLY THE WORST TYRANT EVER KNOWN TO THE LOW COUNTRIES AND HIS EVIL DEEDS OCCUPY MANY STIRRING PAGES IN MOTLEY'S FAMOUS HISTORY
THE FIELD-REGULATING APPARATUS AND THE ELECTRICAL-PRESSURE INDICATOR--FIRST OF ITS KIND--WERE ALSO TESTED AND IN TURN FOUND SATISFACTORY
TO TEST THIS WE DISCONNECTED THE WIRE BETWEEN THE FROG AND BATTERY AND PLACED INSTEAD OF A VIBRATING SOUNDER A SIMPLE MORSE KEY AND A SOUNDER TAKING THE ETHERIC FROM ARMATURE
CONSTANT DROPPING OF FINE PARTICLES OF ACTIVE MATERIAL OFTEN CAUSES SHORT-CIRCUITING OF THE PLATES AND ALWAYS NECESSITATES OCCASIONAL WASHING OUT OF CELLS

SUCH A THING WAS NEW TO THE WORLD AND THE APPARATUS AS WELL AS THE MANUFACTURE THEREOF WAS EQUALLY NEW
8 IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD OF COURSE THAT THE POLAR RELAY AS USED IN THE QUADRUPLEX SYSTEM IS WOUND DIFFERENTIALLY AND THEREFORE ITS OPERATION IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN PRINCIPLE TO THAT OF THE DIFFERENTIALLY WOUND NEUTRAL RELAY IN THAT IT DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE OPERATION OF THE KEY AT THE HOME OFFICE BUT ONLY OPERATES IN RESPONSE TO THE MOVEMENTS OF THE DISTANT KEY
SO THE NEXT TIME I WAS AT THE LABORATORY I TOLD HIM I WAS UNABLE TO GET ANY REPAIR PARTS IN EASTON AND THAT I WISHED TO ORDER SOME OF THE MOST NECESSARY SO THAT IN CASE OF BREAKDOWNS I WOULD NOT BE COMPELLED TO LOSE THE USE OF THE CAR FOR SEVERAL DAYS UNTIL THE PARTS CAME FROM THE AUTOMOBILE FACTORY
WE RAN THROUGH SEVERAL SERIES--I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY AND HAVE LOST TRACK OF THEM NOW BUT IT WAS NOT FAR FROM FIFTY THOUSAND FROM THE VERY FIRST EDISON'S BROAD IDEA OF HIS STORAGE BATTERY WAS TO MAKE PERFORATED METALLIC CONTAINERS HAVING THE ACTIVE MATERIALS PACKED THEREIN
INDEED A CAREFUL STUDY OF LEGAL PROCEDURE OF THIS CHARACTER COULD NOT BE CARRIED FAR WITHOUT DISCOVERY OF THE FACT THAT IN NUMEROUS INSTANCES THE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION BETWEEN LITIGANTS WERE MARKED BY THE UTMOST BONA FIDES
THE AUTHORS ARE INDEBTED FOR THESE FACTS AND SOME OTHER DATA EMBODIED IN THIS BOOK TO MR W
IN 1869 WHEN EDISON WAS OCCUPYING HIS FIRST MANUFACTURING SHOP THE THIRD FLOOR OF A SMALL BUILDING IN NEWARK HE WANTED A FIRST-CLASS MECHANICIAN AND MR OTT WAS SENT TO HIM
EXAMPLES WITHOUT NUMBER COULD BE QUOTED BUT ONE MUST SUFFICE BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION
AFTER HIS PERFORMANCES WERE OVER HE USED TO COME DOWN TO 65 AND TALK ECONOMICS PHILOSOPHY MORAL SCIENCE AND EVERYTHING ELSE
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT EDISON'S OMNIVOROUS READING KEEN OBSERVATION POWER OF ASSIMILATING FACTS AND NATURAL PHENOMENA AND SKILL IN APPLYING THE KNOWLEDGE THUS ATTAINED TO WHATEVER WAS IN HAND NOW CAME INTO FULL PLAY IN DETERMINING THAT THE RESULTS HE DESIRED COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED IN CERTAIN DIRECTIONS
I CAN SEE NOW HOWEVER THAT THE BEST OF US WAS NOTHING BUT THE FLY ON THE WHEEL
IN THIS MANNER MR BRAUNER TRAVERSED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND MILES OF THE COMPARATIVELY UNKNOWN INTERIOR OF SOUTHERN BRAZIL AND PROCURED A LARGE VARIETY OF FIBROUS SPECIMENS WHICH HE SHIPPED TO EDISON A FEW MONTHS LATER
IF THE SINGLE WIRE HAD NOT BROKEN ABOUT EVERY OTHER DAY THE VENTURE WOULD HAVE BEEN A FINANCIAL SUCCESS
VAN HOEVENBERGH A
SOME OF THE ROADS IN GREATER NEW YORK HAVE BEEN ANXIOUS TO SECURE SUCH CARS AND AS USUAL THE MOST RESOURCEFUL ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AND INVENTOR OF HIS TIMES HAS MADE THE EFFORT
CERTAIN IT IS THAT UNDER THIS SIMPLE REGIME STUDIOUS HABITS WERE FORMED AND A TASTE FOR LITERATURE DEVELOPED THAT HAVE LASTED TO THIS DAY
WE HAD AN ARC THERE OF A MOST TERRIFYING CHARACTER BUT THEY NEVER MOVED A MUSCLE ANOTHER EPISODE AT GOERCK STREET DID NOT FIND THE VISITORS QUITE SO STOICAL
FROM THAT TIME UNTIL JULY 1878 HIS TIME AND ATTENTION DAY AND NIGHT WERE ALMOST COMPLETELY ABSORBED BY THE EXCITEMENT CAUSED BY THE INVENTION AND EXHIBITION OF THE MACHINE
HE SAID HE COULD MAKE A FORTUNE WITH IT BECAUSE HE COULD GET OLD NAGS IN THERE AND MAKE THEM ACT LIKE THOROUGHBREDS SO WELL HAD THE WORK BEEN PLANNED AND EXECUTED HOWEVER THAT NOTHING HAPPENED TO HINDER THE CONTINUOUS WORKING OF THE STATION AND THE SUPPLY OF LIGHT TO CUSTOMERS
BUT AS USUAL THIS APPARENTLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTY ONLY SPURRED HIM ON TO FURTHER EFFORT
THE COMBUSTION OF A VASTLY INCREASED BULK OF PULVERIZED COAL AND A GREATLY ENLARGED COMBUSTION ZONE EXTENDING ABOUT FORTY FEET LONGITUDINALLY INTO THE KILN--THUS PROVIDING AN AREA WITHIN WHICH THE MATERIAL MIGHT BE MAINTAINED IN A CLINKERING TEMPERATURE FOR A SUFFICIENTLY LONG PERIOD TO INSURE ITS BEING THOROUGHLY CLINKERED FROM PERIPHERY TO CENTRE
EDISON HIMSELF GIVES THE DETAILS OF THIS EVENTFUL MOVE WHEN HE WENT EAST TO GROW UP WITH THE NEW ART OF ELECTRICITY
THIS WAS A CLASS OF PLANT WHICH THE INQUIRERS DESIRED TO PURCHASE OUTRIGHT AND OPERATE THEMSELVES USUALLY BECAUSE OF REMOTENESS FROM ANY POSSIBLE SOURCE OF GENERAL SUPPLY OF CURRENT
AND THIS ENGAGING A RATCHET-WHEEL SERVED TO GIVE CONTINUOUS ROTATION TO A PULLEY
BUT SUPPOSE THE BATTERIES WERE SO CONNECTED THAT THE CURRENT FROM EACH SET FLOWED IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION
IT WAS ALLOWED TO CARVE OUT ITS OWN CAREER AND THUS ESCAPED THE FATE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ATTENDED OTHER GREAT INVENTIONS--OF BEING BOUGHT UP MERELY FOR PURPOSES OF SUPPRESSION
BUT THE DISAGREEABLE ORDEAL COULD NOT BE DODGED
SOMETIMES HE WOULD NOT GO OVER HIS MAIL FOR DAYS AT A TIME
ALL THAT IS NOW NECESSARY IS TO PUT IN THE WINDOWS DOORS HEATER AND LIGHTING FIXTURES AND TO CONNECT UP THE PLUMBING AND HEATING ARRANGEMENTS THUS MAKING THE HOUSE READY FOR OCCUPANCY
IT WAS OF CIRCULAR FORM INCASED IN IRON WITH THE ENDS OF SEVERAL SMALL MAGNETS STICKING THROUGH THE FLOOR
IN LIKE MANNER THE IRON ELEMENT HAD TO BE DEVELOPED AND IMPROVED

THE DETAIL DEVICES OF THE INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTING SYSTEM ALSO CONTRIBUTE A LARGE QUOTA TO THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PAID OUT IN SALARIES AND WAGES TO MANY THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THEIR MANUFACTURE

NO SENSIBLE OR EFFICIENT STATION MANAGER OR ELECTRIC CONTRACTOR WOULD EVER THINK OF AN INSTALLATION MADE UPON ANY OTHER PLAN
TO SHOW SOME OF THE FEELING AT THE TIME WE REPRODUCE THE FOLLOWING LETTER WHICH APPEARED NOVEMBER 29 1882
ELVERSON OF THE PHILADELPHIA PRESS
EDISON ELABORATED THIS PRINCIPLE IN TWO OTHER FORMS--ONE PNEUMATIC AND ONE ELECTRIC--THE LATTER BEING IN ESSENCE A RECIPROCATING MOTOR
THIS LAMP MUST POSSESS THE QUALITY OF REQUIRING ONLY A SMALL INVESTMENT IN THE COPPER CONDUCTORS REACHING IT
XVII
HE WAS AFTER MONEY AND MONEY ONLY
BUT ALTHOUGH IT HAS YIELDED A CONSIDERABLE PROFIT TO EDISON AND GIVES EMPLOYMENT TO MANY PEOPLE IT IS ONLY ONE OF THE MANY SMALLER ENTERPRISES THAT OWE AN EXISTENCE TO HIS INVENTIVE ABILITY AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY
THE NARRATIVE TELLS OF HIS COMING TO NEW YORK IN 1869 AND IMMEDIATELY PLUNGING INTO THE BUSINESS OF GOLD AND STOCK REPORTING
INASMUCH AS A MAGNET HAS THE POWER OF ATTRACTING TO ITSELF PIECES OF IRON OR STEEL THE BASIC IMPORTANCE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET IN TELEGRAPHY WILL BE AT ONCE APPARENT WHEN WE CONSIDER THE SOUNDER WHOSE CLICKS ARE FAMILIAR TO EVERY EAR

ON THE OTHER HAND THE ENLARGING OF THE APPARATUS TO PERMIT LARGER PICTURES TO BE OBTAINED WOULD PRESENT TOO MUCH WEIGHT TO BE STOPPED AND STARTED WITH THE REQUISITE RAPIDITY
THAT SEEMED TO WORK PRETTY WELL
THIS IDEA WAS STRENGTHENED SHORTLY AFTERWARD WHEN THE WESTERN UNION RAISED THE MONTHLY RENTAL OF THE STOCK TICKERS
AS THUS ORIGINALLY OPERATED THE MOTOR HAD ITS FIELD CIRCUIT IN PERMANENT CONNECTION AS A SHUNT ACROSS THE RAILS AND THIS FIELD CIRCUIT WAS PROTECTED BY A SAFETY-CATCH MADE BY TURNING UP TWO BARE ENDS OF THE WIRE IN ITS CIRCUIT AND WINDING A PIECE OF FINE COPPER WIRE ACROSS FROM ONE BARE END TO THE OTHER
THAT WHICH WAS CONSIDERED GOOD TO-DAY WAS SUPERSEDED BY SOMETHING BETTER AND MORE SERVICEABLE TO-MORROW
I REPORTED AT THE OFFICE OF MR EDISON ON FIFTH AVENUE AND TOLD HIM I HAD SEEN JOHNSON
AS THE PATH TO THE QUADRUPLEX PASSES THROUGH THE DUPLEX LET US CONSIDER THE STEARNS SYSTEM AFTER NOTING ONE OTHER PRINCIPLE--NAMELY THAT IF MORE THAN ONE PATH IS PRESENTED IN WHICH AN ELECTRIC CURRENT MAY COMPLETE ITS CIRCUIT IT DIVIDES IN PROPORTION TO THE RESISTANCE OF EACH PATH

CLARKE THE GLORY OF THE OLD PEARL STREET STATION UNIQUE IN BEARING THE IMPRESS OF MR EDISON'S PERSONALITY AND AS IT WERE CONSTRUCTED WITH HIS OWN HANDS DISAPPEARED IN THE FLAME AND SMOKE OF THAT THURSDAY MORNING FIRE THE FEW DAYS INTERRUPTION OF THE SERVICE WAS THE ONLY SERIOUS ONE THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF THE NEW YORK EDISON COMPANY FROM SEPTEMBER 4 1882 TO THE PRESENT DATE
OTHER INVENTORS SOME OF THEM GREAT AND NOTABLE HAVE BEEN COMING INTO THE FIELD SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE ART PATENTS HAVE MULTIPLIED EXCEEDINGLY IMPROVEMENT HAS SUCCEEDED IMPROVEMENT GREAT COMPANIES HAVE GROWN GREATER NEW CONCERNS HAVE COME INTO EXISTENCE COALITIONS AND MERGERS HAVE TAKEN PLACE ALL TENDING TO PRODUCE CHANGES IN METHODS BUT NOT MUCH IN DIMINUTION OF PATENT LITIGATION
AND SHORTLY AFTERWARD HE SENT A MAN TO JAPAN TO PROCURE FURTHER SUPPLIES OF BAMBOO
FURTHER ELABORATION OF THIS METHOD WAS MADE LATER BY THE ADDITION OF RHEOSTATS CONDENSERS AND LOCAL OPPOSITION BATTERIES ON LONG LINES
AS A MATTER OF FACT THE CHEMICAL ACTIONS AND REACTIONS IN A STORAGE BATTERY ARE MUCH MORE COMPLEX BUT THE ABOVE WILL SERVE TO AFFORD THE LAY READER A RATHER SIMPLE IDEA OF THE GENERAL RESULT ARRIVED AT THROUGH THE CHEMICAL ACTIVITY REFERRED TO
14 1885 350,234 SYSTEM OF RAILWAY SIGNALLING--EDISON AND GILLILAND
WELL IT CAN'T BE MUCH MORE THAN 45 PER CENT
A CORPORATION CLAIMING TO HAVE A SELF-GENERATING DYNAMO PRACTICALLY PERPETUAL MOTION ADVERTISED ITS PREPOSTEROUS CLAIMS EXTENSIVELY AND ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED IN SELLING A LARGE AMOUNT OF STOCK WHICH OF COURSE PROVED TO BE ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS TO ONE WHO IS UNACQUAINTED WITH THE TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE INTRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF PATENTED DEVICES IT MIGHT SEEM UNNECESSARY THAT AN INVENTOR AND HIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATES SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNLAWFUL OR OSTENSIBLE COMPETITION OF PIRATES OR SCHEMERS WHO IN THE ABSENCE OF LEGAL DECISION MAY RUN A FREE COURSE FOR A LONG TIME
IT WILL BE NOTED FROM THE FOREGOING THAT NO CATEGORICAL ANSWER CAN BE OFFERED TO SUCH A QUESTION BUT SUFFICIENT MATERIAL CAN BE GATHERED FROM A STATISTICAL REVIEW OF THE COMMERCIAL ARTS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED TO AFFORD AN APPROXIMATE IDEA OF THE INCREASE IN NATIONAL WEALTH THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY OR HAS COME INTO BEING THROUGH THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF HIS IDEAS
THE OCCURRENCE IS A MATTER OF THE OLD EDISON COMPANY'S RECORDS IT WILL BE SEEN FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THE LIST OF PATENTS IN THE APPENDIX THAT MR EDISON HAS CONTINUED YEAR AFTER YEAR ADDING TO HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ART OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING AND IN THE LAST TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS--1880-1908--HAS TAKEN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE PATENTS IN THIS BRANCH OF INDUSTRY ALONE

THE CHECK WAS HANDED BACK TO HIM AND EDISON FANCYING FOR A MOMENT THAT IN SOME WAY HE HAD BEEN CHEATED WENT OUTSIDE TO THE LARGE STEPS TO LET THE COLD SWEAT EVAPORATE HE THEN WENT BACK TO THE GENERAL WHO WITH HIS SECRETARY HAD A GOOD LAUGH OVER THE MATTER TOLD HIM THE CHECK MUST BE ENDORSED AND SENT WITH HIM A YOUNG MAN TO IDENTIFY HIM

THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SIDE GLIMPSES OF THE INDUSTRIES HE HAS SET ON FOOT AND OF THEIR FINANCIAL ASPECTS AND A LATER CHAPTER WILL ENDEAVOR TO SUM UP THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF EDISON'S WORK TO THE WORLD
IMPROVEMENT UPON IMPROVEMENT WAS THE ORDER OF THE DAY
AND HAD ALSO TO RUN A TEST

ANOTHER IMPROVEMENT THAT FOLLOWED ALONG THE LINES ADOPTED BY EDISON FOR THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PHONOGRAPH WAS MAKING THE RECORDING AND REPRODUCING STYLUSES OF SAPPHIRE AN EXTREMELY HARD NON-OXIDIZABLE JEWEL SO THAT THOSE TINY INSTRUMENTS WOULD ALWAYS RETAIN THEIR TRUE FORM AND EFFECTIVELY RESIST WEAR
ABOUT 6 O'CLOCK THE CARRIAGE WOULD CALL TO TAKE HIM TO DINNER FROM WHICH HE WOULD RETURN BY 7.30 OR 8 O'CLOCK TO RESUME WORK
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE LEAVING THAT BOYISH LABORATORY IN THE OLD HOME AT PORT HURON EDISON HAD A PLACE OF HIS OWN TO WORK IN TO THINK IN
THE HOURS WERE LITERALLY ENDLESS
OUT OF THIS GREW IN TURN THE DISTRICT MESSENGER SYSTEM FOR IT WAS JUST AS EASY TO CALL A MESSENGER AS TO SOUND A FIRE-ALARM OR SUMMON THE POLICE

WHEN HE COULD FIND THE TROUBLE TEN CONSECUTIVE TIMES USING FIVE MINUTES EACH HE WAS SENT TO LONDON

THE INVENTION OF THE THREE-WIRE SYSTEM WHICH WHEN IT WAS FIRST ANNOUNCED AS SAVING OVER 60 PER CENT
EDISON HAD RESOLVED FROM THE VERY FIRST THAT THE INITIAL CENTRAL STATION EMBODYING HIS VARIOUS IDEAS SHOULD BE INSTALLED IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE HE COULD SUPERINTEND THE INSTALLATION PERSONALLY AND THEN WATCH THE OPERATION
EDISON TELLS THIS ILLUMINATING STORY
IN THE MEAN TIME WHILE HE WAS BUSY ALSO WITH HIS NEW STORAGE BATTERY MR MALLORY WHO HAD BEEN HARD AT WORK ON THE CEMENT PLAN ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD COMPLETED ARRANGEMENTS FOR ORGANIZING A COMPANY WITH SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL BACKING TO CARRY ON THE BUSINESS
SO THAT WHILE THE MANUFACTURE OF EDISON PORTLAND CEMENT EMBRACES THE MAIN ESSENTIALS AND FAMILIAR PROCESSES OF CEMENT-MAKING SUCH AS CRUSHING DRYING MIXING ROASTING AND GRINDING HIS VERSATILITY AND ORIGINALITY AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE CONCEPTION AND INTRODUCTION OF SOME BOLD AND REVOLUTIONARY METHODS AND DEVICES HAVE RESULTED IN RAISING HIS PLANT FROM THE POSITION OF AN OUTSIDER TO THE RANK OF THE FIFTH LARGEST PRODUCER IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE SHORT SPACE OF FIVE YEARS AFTER STARTING TO MANUFACTURE
THE REMARK WAS ONCE MADE THAT IF A FAMOUS AMERICAN TEACHER SAT AT ONE END OF A LOG AND A STUDENT AT THE OTHER END THE ELEMENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL UNIVERSITY WERE PRESENT

A NEWSPAPER DESCRIPTION OR A MAGAZINE ARTICLE MAY BE ADMIRABLY COMPLETE IN ITSELF WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BUT UNTIL SOME PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IS HAD OF THE THING DESCRIBED IT DOES NOT CONVEY A PERFECT MENTAL PICTURE NOR CAN IT ALWAYS MAKE THE DESIRE ACTIVE AND INSISTENT
ON NEW YEAR'S EVE 1879 SPECIAL TRAINS WERE RUN TO MENLO PARK BY THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD AND OVER THREE THOUSAND PERSONS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT THERE AND WITNESS THIS DEMONSTRATION FOR THEMSELVES
THEY ALL PROCEEDED TO THE ROOM WHERE THE MOTOR WAS AT WORK
THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE LENT ME HIS PRIVATE BOX
I BECAME QUITE VALUABLE TO MR WALKER
AT ONE TIME MR VILLARD GOT THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD RUN THE MOUNTAIN DIVISION OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD BY ELECTRICITY
THE BURNING OF AN INDEFINITE NUMBER OF LIGHTS ON THE SAME CIRCUIT
HIS FATHER INSISTED ON 11.30 AS PROPER BEDTIME WHICH LEFT BUT A SHORT INTERVAL AFTER THE LONG DAY ON THE TRAIN
I HAPPENED TO BE IN THE STATION AND WENT OUT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS
WHEREAS THE MODERN PLANT INVARIABLY SEEKS THE BANK OF A RIVER OR LAKE FOR THE PURPOSE OF A GENEROUS SUPPLY OF WATER FOR ITS CONDENSING ENGINES OR STEAM-TURBINES
THE VERY NEXT ENTRY IN THE LABORATORY NOTE-BOOK BEARS THE SAME DATE AS THE ABOVE DECEMBER 5 1875 AND IS ENTITLED LONGITUDINAL VIBRATIONS AND READS AS FOLLOWS
ABOUT THIS TIME I GOT AN IDEA I COULD DEVISE AN APPARATUS BY WHICH FOUR MESSAGES COULD SIMULTANEOUSLY BE SENT OVER A SINGLE WIRE WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH EACH OTHER
THIS I BELIEVE IN
MR ADAMS REMARKS
I STARTED IN TO MAKE A NUMBER OF THESE LAMPS BUT I SOON FOUND THAT THE X-RAY HAD AFFECTED POISONOUSLY MY ASSISTANT MR DALLY SO THAT HIS HAIR CAME OUT AND HIS FLESH COMMENCED TO ULCERATE
WHILE AT THE EXPOSITION I VISITED THE OPERA-HOUSE
HE ONCE SAID THAT HE WAS EDUCATED IN A UNIVERSITY WHERE ALL THE STUDENTS BELONGED TO FAMILIES OF THE ARISTOCRACY
IT WAS HELD TIGHTLY BY SCREWS
BUT IT WAS SOON NOTICED THAT IN SPITE OF THE REGULARITY OF THE REPORT SF COULD NOT BE RAISED EVEN IF A TRAIN MESSAGE WERE SENT IMMEDIATELY AFTER
FOLLOWING HIS USUAL CUSTOM EDISON WOULD INDICATE THE LINES OF EXPERIMENT TO BE FOLLOWED WHICH WERE CARRIED OUT AND RECORDED IN THE NOTE-BOOKS
COST OF HANDLING A TON OF FREIGHT PER MILE PER HORSE-POWER TO BE LESS THAN ORDINARY LOCOMOTIVE
YET THESE THINGS DO NOT AT ALL AFFECT HIS SLUMBER OR HIS DEMOCRATIC SIMPLICITY FOR IN THAT AS IN EVERYTHING ELSE HE IS ATTENDING STRICTLY TO BUSINESS DOING THE THING THAT IS NEXT TO HIM PART OF THE RUSH AND FEVERISH HASTE WAS DUE TO THE APPROACH OF FROST WHICH AS USUAL IN NEW YORK SUSPENDED OPERATIONS IN THE EARTH
OR FILAMENTS OF ZIRCONIA OXIDE OR ALUMINA OR MAGNESIA THORIA OR OTHER INFUSIBLE OXIDES MIXED OR SEPARATE AND OBTAINED BY MOISTENING AND SQUIRTING THROUGH A DIE ARE THUS COATED WITH ABOVE METALS AND USED FOR INCANDESCENT LAMPS

AFTER A VERY FULL REVIEW OF THE FACTS IN THE CASE AND A FAIR CONSIDERATION OF THE DEFENDANTS AFFIDAVITS JUDGE COLT IN HIS OPINION GOES ON TO SAY

BUT THE IDEA MIGHT BE MADE TO WORK TURNING FROM THE AIR TO THE EARTH IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF THE UNDERGROUND EDISON SYSTEM IN NEW YORK MADE AN APPEAL TO INVENTIVE INGENUITY AND THAT ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES WAS MET AS FOLLOWS
THIS I FOLLOW UP TO ITS LEGITIMATE CONCLUSION DISCARDING THE OTHERS AND USUALLY GET WHAT I AM AFTER
THE PERFORATED TAPE WAS THEN PLACED IN THE TRANSMITTING INSTRUMENT THE ESSENTIAL PARTS OF WHICH WERE A METALLIC DRUM AND A PROJECTING ARM CARRYING TWO SMALL WHEELS WHICH BY MEANS OF A SPRING WERE MAINTAINED IN CONSTANT PRESSURE ON THE DRUM
THE CHARGING OF BRIQUETTES WAS BEGUN WITH A PERCENTAGE OF 25 PER CENT AND WAS CARRIED UP TO 100 PER CENT

MY FATHER CAME THERE WHEN HE WAS EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE
SUCH A STUPENDOUS FEAT WHOSE EQUAL IS FAR TO SEEK ANYWHERE IN THE HISTORY OF INVENTION IS WORTH STUDYING ESPECIALLY AS THE TASK WILL TAKE US OVER MUCH NEW GROUND AND OVER VERY LITTLE OF THE TERRITORY ALREADY COVERED
I TOOK A LOT OF TICKER PAPER TAPE TURNED IT INTO GUNCOTTON AND GOT UP AN ENGINE WITH AN ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY I COULD FEED THIS GUN-COTTON STRIP INTO THE CYLINDER AND EXPLODE IT INSIDE ELECTRICALLY
WE SHALL OFFER A FEW BRIEF EXTRACTS FROM SOME OF THESE DECISIONS
THE REFERENCE FIGURES ARE USED AS BEFORE BUT IN THIS CASE THE VERTICAL LINES REPRESENT BRANCHES TAKEN FROM THE MAIN CONDUCTORS INTO BUILDINGS OR OTHER SPACES TO BE LIGHTED AND THE LOOPS BETWEEN THESE BRANCH WIRES REPRESENT LAMPS IN OPERATION
ANY ONE WHO WILL TURN TO THE LIST OF EDISON PATENTS AT THE END OF THE BOOK WILL FIND A LARGE NUMBER OF THINGS OF WHICH NOT EVEN CASUAL MENTION HAS BEEN MADE BUT WHICH AT THE TIME OCCUPIED NO SMALL AMOUNT OF THE INVENTOR'S TIME AND ATTENTION AND MANY OF WHICH ARE NOW PART AND PARCEL OF MODERN CIVILIZATION
BY REASON HOWEVER OF DISSATISFACTION CAUSED FROM THE INABILITY OF CUSTOMERS TO READ THE INDICATIONS OF THE METER IT HAS IN LATER YEARS TO A GREAT EXTENT BEEN REPLACED BY REGISTERING METERS THAT CAN BE READ BY THE CUSTOMER THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METER IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
SUCH A SCHEME INVOLVED THE CREATION OF AN ENTIRELY NEW ART FOR THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH FROM WHICH TO DRAW ASSISTANCE OR PRECEDENT UNLESS WE EXCEPT THE ELEMENTARY FORMS OF DYNAMOS THEN IN EXISTENCE
MINERAL AND VEGETABLE OILS CLAY MICA OZOKERITE ETC
THE FIRST PLANT TO BE PLACED ON A UNITED STATES STEAMSHIP WAS THE ONE CONSISTING OF AN EDISON Z DYNAMO AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT-CANDLE LAMPS INSTALLED ON THE FISH COMMISSION'S STEAMER ALBATROSS IN 1883
TO PUT HIS IDEAS INTO PRACTICE EDISON BUILT A SHORT RAILWAY LINE AT THE ORANGE WORKS IN THE WINTER OF 1909-10 AND IN CO-OPERATION WITH MR R
I TOOK CHARGE REDUCING THE SPEED TO ABOUT TWELVE MILES AN HOUR AND BROUGHT THE TRAIN OF SEVEN CARS TO HER DESTINATION AT THE GRAND TRUNK JUNCTION SAFELY
THE DISCOVERY OF THE AVAILABILITY OF CARBON WAS UNQUESTIONABLY INVENTION AND IT RESULTED IN THE FIRST PRACTICAL SUCCESS IN THE ART VII
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT AT A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR CRISIS IN LIFE YOUNG ROBERT BURNS ENTERTAINED SERIOUSLY THE IDEA OF FORSAKING SCOTLAND FOR THE WEST INDIES
HE WANTED TO KNOW FOR HIMSELF HOW THINGS WENT WHY FOR SOME OCCULT REASON A LITTLE CHANGE WAS NECESSARY WHAT IMPROVEMENT COULD BE MADE IN THE MATERIAL
EDISON ALSO MADE TESTS ON HIS FIELD MAGNETS BY SLOWLY RAISING THE STRENGTH OF THE EXCITING CURRENT SO THAT HE OBTAINED FIGURES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN BY A MAGNETIC CURVE AND IN THIS WAY FOUND WHERE SATURATION COMMENCED AND WHERE IT WAS USELESS TO EXPEND MORE CURRENT ON THE FIELD
MY ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY THE FACT THAT HE WALKED OFF AFTER RESPONDING AND THE SENDER HAPPENED TO BE A GOOD ONE
15 1883 509,517 SYSTEM OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION
THE LOCOMOTIVE BUILT WHILE THE ROADBED WAS GETTING READY WAS A FOUR-WHEELED IRON TRUCK AN ORDINARY FLAT DUMP-CAR ABOUT SIX FEET LONG AND FOUR FEET WIDE UPON WHICH WAS MOUNTED A Z DYNAMO USED AS A MOTOR SO THAT IT HAD A CAPACITY OF ABOUT TWELVE HORSEPOWER
BROADWAY IS AS QUIET TO ME AS A COUNTRY VILLAGE IS TO A PERSON WITH NORMAL HEARING SADDENED BUT NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED EDISON SOON RECONSTITUTED HIS LABORATORY AND PRINTING-OFFICE AT HOME ALTHOUGH ON THE PART OF THE FAMILY THERE WAS SOME FEAR AND OBJECTION AFTER THIS EPISODE ON THE SCORE OF FIRE
THE OVERHEAD TROLLEY HAD BY THAT TIME BEGUN ITS VICTORIOUS CAREER BUT THERE WAS INTENSE HOSTILITY DISPLAYED TOWARD IT IN MANY PLACES BECAUSE OF THE INEVITABLE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OVERHEAD WIRES WHICH CARRYING AS THEY DID A CURRENT OF HIGH VOLTAGE AND LARGE QUANTITY WERE REGARDED AS A MENACE TO LIFE AND PROPERTY
WHAT TO DO WAS THE IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT CONFRONTED HIM
AND THE ARCHIVES OF THE LABORATORY THAT PRESERVE ONLY A VERY MINUTE PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE A FURTHER DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT PUBLICITY MEANS WHERE A FIGURE LIKE EDISON IS CONCERNED
IT WAS EARLY RECOGNIZED THAT A SINGLE NEEDLE FOR FORMING THE RECORD AND THE REPRODUCTION THEREFROM WAS AN UNDESIRABLE ARRANGEMENT SINCE THE FORMATION OF THE RECORD REQUIRED A VERY SHARP CUTTING-TOOL WHILE SATISFACTORY AND REPEATED REPRODUCTION SUGGESTED THE USE OF A STYLUS WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THE MINIMUM WEAR
THEY WERE FREE-SOULED CREATURES EXCELLENT COMPANY SENSITIVE CHEERFUL AND PROFANE

AT THE TOP OF THE BUILDING WAS A FLOOR ON WHICH THESE NOVICES WERE GRADUATED IN THE USE AND CARE OF THE MACHINE AND THEN WITH AN EQUIPMENT OF TINFOIL AND OTHER SUPPLIES THEY WERE SENT OUT ON THE ROAD

EDISON SEEMS TO HAVE NOTICED SOMETHING OF THE KIND IN WHAT HE CALLED ETHERIC FORCE HIS NAME ETHERIC MAY THIRTEEN YEARS AGO HAVE SEEMED TO MANY PEOPLE ABSURD
I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID OF THINGS THAT WORKED THE FIRST TIME
BY MEANS OF THESE PINS THE CHEMICALLY PREPARED TAPE WAS MARKED WITH DOTS CORRESPONDING TO THE IMPULSES AS RECEIVED LEAVING UPON IT A LEGIBLE RECORD OF THE LETTERS AND WORDS TRANSMITTED
EVERY DEPARTMENT OF MECHANICS WAS STIMULATED AND BENEFITED TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE
A IS A BAR OF SOFT IRON BENT AS SHOWN AND WOUND AROUND WITH INSULATED COPPER WIRE THE ENDS OF WHICH ARE CONNECTED WITH A BATTERY B THUS FORMING AN ELECTROMAGNET
HIS FIRST OBJECTIVE POINT WAS QUITO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES AWAY WHICH HE PROPOSED TO REACH ON FOOT AND BY MEANS OF CANOEING ON THE NAPO RIVER THROUGH A WILD AND COMPARATIVELY UNKNOWN COUNTRY TEEMING WITH TRIBES OF HOSTILE NATIVES
THERE WAS A WAGON PROVIDED WITH A TELEGRAPH OPERATOR BATTERY AND INSTRUMENTS FOR EACH DIVISION CORPS AND ARMY AND FOR MY HEADQUARTERS
THE NEXT MORNING I WENT WITH GOULD TO THE OFFICE OF HIS LAWYERS SHERMAN STERLING AND RECEIVED A CHECK FOR $30,000 WITH A REMARK BY GOULD THAT I HAD GOT THE STEAMBOAT PLYMOUTH ROCK AS HE HAD SOLD HER FOR $30,000 AND HAD JUST RECEIVED THE CHECK
THIS ABILITY TO STORE UP ELECTRICAL ENERGY PRODUCED BY DYNAMOS IN HOURS OTHERWISE IDLE WHETHER DRIVEN BY STEAM WIND OR WATER WAS A DISTINCT ADVANCE IN THE ART
IT HAS BEEN NOTED BY INTIMATE OBSERVERS OF THOMAS A
IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT WHILE THE MODERN ART OF MOTION PICTURES DEPENDS ESSENTIALLY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSTANTANEOUS PHOTOGRAPHY THE SUGGESTION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SECURING A REPRODUCTION OF ANIMATE MOTION AS WELL AS IN A GENERAL WAY OF THE MECHANISM FOR ACCOMPLISHING THE RESULT WAS MADE MANY YEARS BEFORE THE INSTANTANEOUS PHOTOGRAPH BECAME POSSIBLE
ONE DAY WE WENT DOWN TO THE ROUND-HOUSE OF THE CINCINNATI INDIANAPOLIS RAILROAD AND CONNECTED UP THE LONG WASH-TANK IN THE ROOM WITH THE COIL ONE ELECTRODE BEING CONNECTED TO EARTH
I WAS AT LIBERTY TO TAKE MY PAY AND GET OUT THE FACT THAT EDISON IS A VERY STUDIOUS MAN AN INSATIATE LOVER AND READER OF BOOKS IS WELL KNOWN TO HIS ASSOCIATES
I BUILT THESE WORKS ENTIRELY OF CONCRETE AND STEEL SO THAT THERE IS NOT A WAGON-LOAD OF LUMBER IN THEM
A FRIEND OF MINE WAS AN OPERATOR WHO WORKED IN THE OFFICE OF BELDEN COMPANY 60 BROADWAY WHICH WERE HEADQUARTERS FOR FISK
RULE-OF-THUMB METHODS ARE NEVER ACCEPTABLE TO EDISON AND HE DEVISED THEREFORE A SYSTEM OF WEIGHING EACH PART OF THE MIXTURE SO THAT IT WOULD BE CORRECT TO A POUND AND EVEN AT THAT MADE THE DEVICE FOOL-PROOF FOR AS HE OBSERVED TO ONE OF HIS ASSOCIATES
AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE PERPLEXING NATURE OF EXPERT EVIDENCE IN PATENT CASES THE READER WILL PROBABLY BE INTERESTED IN PERUSING THE FOLLOWING EXTRACTS FROM THE OPINION OF JUDGE DAYTON IN THE SUIT OF BRYCE BROS
I HAD TO PAY $300 FOR NOT EXPERIMENTING PROPERLY DURING THIS YEAR 1878 THE PHONOGRAPH MADE ITS WAY ALSO TO EUROPE AND VARIOUS SUMS OF MONEY WERE PAID THERE TO SECURE THE RIGHTS TO ITS MANUFACTURE AND EXPLOITATION
IN A SIMILAR MANNER IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT CABLES OF TELEPHONE WIRES COULD BE LAID UNDERGROUND OR SUSPENDED OVERHEAD COMMUNICATING BY BRANCH WIRES WITH PRIVATE DWELLINGS COUNTRY HOUSES SHOPS MANUFACTORIES ETC UNITING THEM THROUGH THE MAIN CABLE WITH A CENTRAL OFFICE WHERE THE WIRE COULD BE CONNECTED AS DESIRED ESTABLISHING DIRECT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ANY TWO PLACES IN THE CITY

AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH THE DOOR ONE OF THEM TURNED TO ME AND SAID
BY PLACING THE OBJECT TO BE OBSERVED SUCH AS THE HAND BETWEEN THE VACUUM-TUBE AND THE FLUORESCENT SCREEN THE SHADOW IS FORMED ON THE SCREEN AND CAN BE OBSERVED AT LEISURE
THIS ROPE WAS WOUND SEVEN TIMES OVER THE SHEAVES AS ABOVE AND LED UPWARD AND OVER A SINGLE-GROOVE SHEAVE WHICH WAS OPERATED BY THE PISTON OF AN AIR-CYLINDER AND IN THIS MANNER THE PRESSURE WAS APPLIED TO THE ROLLS
RETURNING EAST MR LOWREY TOOK UP PRACTICE IN NEW YORK SOON BECOMING EMINENT IN HIS PROFESSION AND UPON THE ACCESSION OF WILLIAM ORTON TO THE PRESIDENCY OF THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY IN 1866 HE WAS APPOINTED ITS GENERAL COUNSEL THE DUTIES OF WHICH POST HE DISCHARGED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
EACH SUBSCRIBER FOR A MACHINE PAID IN $100 FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF SECURING AN INSTRUMENT
BUT WHEN WE GOT INTO CALM WATER AND COULD SEE THE GREEN FIELDS I WAS ASTOUNDED TO SEE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO APPEARED
IT WAS AN ELABORATED FORM OF THE TYPE COVERED BY MY PATENT NO
AND FINALLY WE CHANGED THREE LETTERS
LATER ON AND AS THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT IN THE PHONOGRAPH FIELD FROM A COMMERCIAL POINT OF VIEW CAME THE DUPLICATION OF RECORDS TO THE EXTENT OF MANY THOUSANDS FROM A SINGLE MASTER THIS WORK WAS ACTIVELY DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE YEARS 1890 AND 1898 AND ITS DIFFICULTIES MAY BE APPRECIATED WHEN THE PROBLEM IS STATED
THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET FREE WAS TO BACK OFF AND PULL THE COIL SO THAT THE BATTERY WIRES WOULD PULL THE CELLS OFF THE SHELF AND THUS BREAK THE CIRCUIT
FORTY-ONE DISTINCT INVENTIONS RELATING TO THE PHONOGRAPH COVERING VARIOUS FORMS OF RECORDERS ARRANGEMENT OF PARTS MAKING OF RECORDS SHAVING TOOL ADJUSTMENTS ETC
IT WAS A MOST NOTEWORTHY INVENTION FOR IT BROUGHT INTO THE ART NOT ONLY A GREATER EFFICIENCY OF GRINDING THAN HAD EVER BEEN DREAMED OF BEFORE BUT ALSO A TREMENDOUS ECONOMY BY THE SAVING OF POWER
WHEN ON THE NEW YORK NO
HIS NAME IS ON THE TIP OF THE WORLD'S TONGUE
CLARKE ONE OF THE EARLIEST ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS EMPLOYED BY MR EDISON MADE A NUMBER OF TESTS ON THIS 1882 RAILROAD
TO A STUDENT OF TO-DAY ALL THIS SEEMS SIMPLE BUT IN THOSE DAYS THE ART OF CONSTRUCTING DYNAMOS WAS ABOUT AS DARK AS AIR NAVIGATION IS AT PRESENT
FAILURES DO NOT DISTRESS HIM
THIS DEVICE NOT ONLY WORKED WITH GREAT RAPIDITY BUT WAS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE AND WOULD RESPOND TO CURRENTS TOO WEAK TO AFFECT THE MOST DELICATE ELECTROMAGNETIC RELAY

IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE PRESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT EDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES IN THE LEADING CITIES
IF THERE WAS A SIGHT THAT WAS STILL MORE FUNNY IT WAS TO SEE HIM TURN OVER ON HIS OTHER SIDE ALL THE TIME REMAINING IN THE DESK
IT IS AN ORDINARY INDICATION THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING MEETING WHEN THE CARETAKER ABOUT FILLS A WASTE-BASKET WITH THESE DISCARDED SKETCHES
IN THE COURSE OF YEARS HE GREW MORE AND MORE IMPATIENT OF THE SHACKLES THAT BOUND HIM TO BUSINESS ROUTINE AND REALIZING THE POWERS WITHIN HIM HE DREW AWAY GRADUALLY FROM PURELY MANUFACTURING OCCUPATIONS DETERMINING DELIBERATELY TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO INVENTIVE WORK AND TO DEPEND UPON ITS RESULTS AS A MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE

THE SUIT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ELECTRIC LIGHTING COMPANY WAS BROUGHT IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK IN 1885
THE LABORATORY NOTE-BOOKS DO NOT ALWAYS TELL THE WHOLE STORY OR MEANING OF AN EXPERIMENT THAT MAY BE BRIEFLY OUTLINED ON ONE OF THEIR PAGES
AND A LARGE PAY-ROLL HAD BEEN RAISED WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY
I HAD NEVER SEEN ONE AND DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WORKED WITH THE RESULT THAT WE SOON BURNED UP THE BABBITT METAL IN THE BEARINGS AND SPENT A GOOD PART OF THE NIGHT GETTING THEM IN ORDER
OF THE TOTAL WHILE THAT FROM ARC LIGHTING WAS LESS THAN 29
BY APRIL OF 1882 THE BULLETIN HAD ATTAINED THE RESPECTABLE SIZE OF SIXTEEN PAGES
THE NEAREST HE WOULD EVER COME TO IT WAS WHEN THERE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN SOME STORY TOLD AND HIS FACE WOULD EXPRESS A DESIRE TO JOIN IN THE LAUGH WHICH WOULD IMMEDIATELY INVITE TELLING THE STORY TO HIM NEXT TO THOSE WHO WORKED WITH EDISON AT THE LABORATORY AND WERE WITH HIM CONSTANTLY AT MENLO PARK WERE THE VISITORS SOME OF WHOM WERE HIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATES SOME OF THEM SCIENTIFIC MEN AND SOME OF THEM HERO-WORSHIPPERS AND CURIOSITY-HUNTERS
ONE DAY I GOT A NEW MAN AND TOLD HIM TO CONDUCT A CERTAIN EXPERIMENT
AT FIRST MR KRUESI WAS BROUGHT IN BUT WHENEVER A STATEMENT WAS MADE WHICH HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND OR DID NOT BELIEVE COULD BE SUBSTANTIATED HE WOULD BLURT RIGHT OUT AMONG THESE PROSPECTS THAT HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT
ALTHOUGH ALL THE LABORATORY EXPERIMENTERS AGREE IN THE OPINION THAT HE TRIES EVERYTHING IT IS NOT MERELY THE MIXING OF A LITTLE OF THIS SOME OF THAT AND A FEW DROPS OF THE OTHER IN THE HOPE THAT SOMETHING WILL COME OF IT
BUT FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THE BUSINESS WHEN IT WAS IN ITS EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD WHEN THE EDISON LIGHT AND POWER SYSTEM WAS BUT AN IDEA DOWN TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH HENRY VILLARD CONTINUED A STRONG SUPPORTER NOT ONLY WITH HIS INFLUENCE BUT WITH HIS MONEY

FIRST THE OUTER FRAME THEN THE FLOORS AND INNER WALLS FOLLOWED BY THE STAIRWAYS AND SO ON UP TO THE PUTTING ON OF THE ROOF
I HURRIEDLY COPIED IT AND HE SENT IT REQUESTING THE AGENTS TO DISPLAY IT ON THE BLACKBOARDS USED FOR STATING THE ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE OF TRAINS
A STANDARD FORM OF NOTE-BOOK ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF BY SIX INCHES CONTAINING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PAGES WAS ADOPTED
HENCE IF ONE SHOUTED
I INFORMED HIM THAT THE GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT HAD TOLD ME TO BREAK IN AND SEND THE DESPATCH BUT THE GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT THEN AND THERE REPUDIATED THE WHOLE THING
EARLY IN 1881 IT WAS ALTOGETHER A PAPER ENTERPRISE BUT EVENTS MOVED SWIFTLY AS NARRATED ALREADY AND ON JUNE 25 1881 THE FIRST JUMBO PROTOTYPE OF THE DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINES TO GENERATE CURRENT AT THE PEARL STREET STATION WAS PUT THROUGH ITS PACES BEFORE BEING SHIPPED TO PARIS TO FURNISH NEW SENSATIONS TO THE FLANEUR OF THE BOULEVARDS
BUT MOST OF THE APPARATUS AND DEVICES INVENTED OR SUGGESTED BY HIM AS THE ART TOOK SHAPE REQUIRED THE HANDIWORK OF SKILLED MECHANICS AND ARTISANS OF A HIGH ORDER OF ABILITY
INDOMITABLY RESOLVED TO ASSERT THEIR REPUBLICAN MANHOOD BY TAKING NO ORDERS FROM A TALL-HATTED ENGLISHMAN WHOSE STIFF POLITENESS COVERED HIS CONVICTION THAT THEY WERE RELATIVELY TO HIMSELF INFERIOR AND COMMON PERSONS THEY INSISTED ON BEING SLAVE-DRIVEN WITH GENUINE AMERICAN OATHS BY A GENUINE FREE AND EQUAL AMERICAN FOREMAN
A VIGOROUS AND AGGRESSIVE LEGAL CAMPAIGN WAS THEREFORE INAUGURATED BY THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY AGAINST THE NUMEROUS INFRINGING COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD SPRUNG UP WHILE THE MAIN SUIT WAS PENDING
HE TOOK HIS MEALS AT THE SAME EMACIATOR THAT I DID
AS I WENT OUT TO TELL THE MAN IN CHARGE WHAT THE MATTER WAS DOCTOR LAWS APPEARED ON THE SCENE THE MOST EXCITED PERSON I HAD SEEN
ALSO THE ARRANGEMENT OF COMPLETE STATIONS WITH STEAM AND ELECTRIC APPARATUS AND AUXILIARY DEVICES FOR INSURING THEIR EFFICIENT AND CONTINUOUS OPERATION
NOR WAS THE EFFECT OF SUCH GREAT ADVANCES AS THOSE MADE BY EDISON LIMITED TO THE ELECTRICAL FIELD
THERE WAS A LEAK IN ONE OF OUR JUNCTION-BOXES AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE CELLARS EXTENDING UNDER THE STREET THE TOP SOIL HAD BECOME INSULATED
THIS IMMENSE AMOUNT OF INVESTIGATION WHICH HAD CONSUMED SO MANY MONTHS OF TIME AND WHICH HAD CULMINATED IN THE DISCOVERY OF A SERIES OF REACTIONS BETWEEN NICKEL AND IRON THAT BORE GREAT PROMISE BROUGHT EDISON MERELY WITHIN SIGHT OF A STRANGE AND HITHERTO UNEXPLORED COUNTRY
EDISON AND FAUST ARE INDEED THE EXTREMES OF PHILOSOPHIC THOUGHT AND ACCOMPLISHMENT
ON THE ONE HAND IT WAS OBVIOUSLY NECESSARY IN A LIGHTING SYSTEM THAT EACH LAMP SHOULD BE OF STANDARD CANDLE-POWER AND CAPABLE OF INTERCHANGEABLE USE ON ANY PART OF THE SYSTEM GIVING THE SAME DEGREE OF ILLUMINATION AT EVERY POINT WHETHER NEAR TO OR REMOTE FROM THE SOURCE OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY
I HAVE A MAN EXPERIMENTING AND TESTING ALL THE TIME
WITH THE BELL APPARATUS THE VERY WEAK ELECTRIC IMPULSES GENERATED BY THE VIBRATION OF THE TRANSMITTING DIAPHRAGM PASS OVER THE ENTIRE LINE TO THE RECEIVING END AND IN CONSEQUENCE THE PERMISSIBLE LENGTH OF LINE IS LIMITED TO A FEW MILES UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS
HE ASKED MY PRICE
AND CURRENT WAS FURNISHED TO CUSTOMERS WITH A TOTAL OF NEARLY TEN THOUSAND LAMPS CONNECTED TO THE MAINS
THAT A CORPORATION SHOULD BE HELD UP WAS ACCEPTED PHILOSOPHICALLY BY THE CORPORATION AS ONE OF THE UNAVOIDABLE INCIDENTS OF ITS BUSINESS
THREE DEVICES FOR UTILIZING VIBRATIONS BEYOND THE ULTRA VIOLET

TO HIM MR EDISON ASSIGNED THE TASK OF MAKING A COMPLETE MODEL OF THE NETWORK OF CONDUCTORS FOR THE CONTEMPLATED FIRST STATION IN NEW YORK MR FRANCIS R
THE PRINCIPLES OF MANY OF THESE DEVICES ARE STILL USED IN THE ARTS BUT HAVE BECOME SO INCORPORATED IN OTHER DEVICES AS TO BE INSEPARABLE AND CANNOT NOW BE DEALT WITH SEPARATELY
THE PERFORATIONS BEING SO ARRANGED AS TO REGULATE THE LENGTH OF THE CONTACT THE RESULT WOULD BE THE TRANSMISSION OF LONG AND SHORT IMPULSES CORRESPONDING WITH THE DOTS AND DASHES OF THE MORSE ALPHABET
YET EVIDENTLY BUT FOR SUCH INVENTIONS AS THIS SUCH ARTS COULD NOT HAVE COME INTO EXISTENCE AT ALL OR ELSE IN GROWING UP THEY WOULD HAVE FORCED COPPER TO STARVATION PRICES

HE SAW ITS POSSIBILITIES AS WELL AS THE CHIEF OBSTACLES TO BE OVERCOME--VIZ THE SLUGGISHNESS OF THE WIRE TOGETHER WITH THE NEED OF MECHANICAL BETTERMENT OF THE APPARATUS
SIR,--IN READING THE DISCUSSIONS RELATIVE TO THE PEARL STREET STATION OF THE EDISON LIGHT I HAVE NOTED THAT WHILE IT IS CLAIMED THAT THERE IS SCARCELY ANY LOSS FROM LEAKAGE OF CURRENT NOTHING IS SAID ABOUT THE LOSS DUE TO THE RESISTANCE OF THE LONG CIRCUITS
EDISON SAID
AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS THE BRIQUETTES WERE SO HARD THAT THEY WOULD NOT BREAK OR CRUMBLE IN LOADING ON THE CARS OR IN TRANSPORTATION BY RAIL WHILE THEY WERE SO POROUS AS TO BE CAPABLE OF ABSORBING 26 PER CENT
WITH ITS ASSISTANCE WHICH COST NOTHING THESE OPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED PERFECTLY
I MANAGED TO SAY THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS FAIR
DIFFICULT AS IT MAY BE--PERHAPS IMPOSSIBLE--TO TRACE ITS ORIGIN EDISON POSSESSES WHAT HE WOULD PROBABLY CALL A WELL-DEVELOPED CASE OF NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE FOR WHOSE APPROVAL HE IS INCESSANTLY OCCUPIED
IT WAS THUS HE TURNED NEWSBOY OVERCOMING THE RELUCTANCE OF HIS PARENTS PARTICULARLY THAT OF HIS MOTHER BY POINTING OUT THAT HE COULD BY THIS MEANS EARN ALL HE WANTED FOR HIS EXPERIMENTS AND GET FRESH READING IN THE SHAPE OF PAPERS AND MAGAZINES FREE OF CHARGE
AND HIS ASSISTANTS WERE GIVEN LONG LISTS OF MATERIALS TO TRY WITH REFERENCE TO PREDETERMINED STANDARDS OF ARTICULATION DEGREES OF LOUDNESS AND PERFECTION OF HISSING SOUNDS
SOME BOXES CAN BE OPERATED BY THE PASSING PUBLIC
WHEN I PRESSED HIM FOR AN EXPLANATION HE WAS UNABLE TO GIVE ANY DEFINITE REASONS EXCEPT THAT HE FELT POSITIVE IT COULD BE DONE

BE SURE ALL THE ASH IS OUT OF THE TURPENTINE PORTION
IT HAD A SMALL MACHINE SHOP AND WAS THE POINT WHERE LOCOMOTIVES WERE CHANGED FOR THE NEXT SECTION
THIS HOWEVER IS MADE CLEAR--SO FAR AS CONCERNS EDISON'S INVENTION AT ANY RATE--IN CHAPTER VIII OF THE PRECEDING NARRATIVE
HE APPLIED IN 1859 FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF SELLING NEWSPAPERS ON THE TRAINS OF THE GRAND TRUNK RAILROAD BETWEEN PORT HURON AND DETROIT AND OBTAINED THE CONCESSION AFTER A SHORT DELAY DURING WHICH HE MADE AN ESSAY IN HIS TASK OF SELLING NEWSPAPERS
THE CROWD KEPT INCREASING
THREE-HUNDRED PAIRS OF STOCKINGS RECEIVED THIS DAY FIVE CENTS A PAIR--NO CONNECTION WITH THE STORE NEXT DOOR PRESENTLY THE OTHER STORE PUT UP A SIGN STATING THEY HAD RECEIVED THREE HUNDRED PAIRS PRICE THREE CENTS PER PAIR AND STATED THAT THEY HAD NO CONNECTION WITH THE STORE NEXT DOOR

THE TYPEWRITER I GOT INTO COMMERCIAL SHAPE IS NOW KNOWN AS THE REMINGTON
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED RADICALLY SINCE EDISON BECAME A TELEGRAPHER AND THAT IN THIS RESPECT A CHAPTER OF ELECTRICAL HISTORY HAS BEEN DEFINITELY CLOSED
THESE SPANISH PARTIES WERE PERFECTLY SATISFIED WE COULD PUT IN AN ELECTRIC RAILWAY FROM HONDA TO BOGOTA SUCCESSFULLY AND THEN THEY DISAPPEARED
I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT IF SUFFICIENT ELEVATION BE OBTAINED TO OVERCOME THE CURVATURE OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE AND TO REDUCE TO THE MINIMUM THE EARTH'S ABSORPTION ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHING OR SIGNALLING BETWEEN DISTANT POINTS CAN BE CARRIED ON BY INDUCTION WITHOUT THE USE OF WIRES CONNECTING SUCH DISTANT POINTS
BUT IN THE BATTERY OUR DIFFICULTIES CANNOT BE SEEN OR HEARD BUT MUST BE OBSERVED BY OUR MIND'S EYE AND BY REASON OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF SUCH VISION IN THE PAST EDISON IS NOW ABLE TO SEE QUITE CLEARLY THROUGH THE FOREST OF DIFFICULTIES AFTER ELIMINATING THEM ONE BY ONE THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE CONTAINING POCKETS IN THE BATTERY PLATES OR ELEMENTS AND THE DEGREE OF THEIR PERFORATION WERE MATTERS THAT RECEIVED MANY YEARS OF CLOSE STUDY AND EXPERIMENT
THE DYNAMO WAS DRIVEN BY THE WAVE OR TIDE MOTION THROUGH INTERMEDIATE MECHANISM AND THUS THE LAMPS WERE LIT UP FROM TIME TO TIME SERVING AS SIGNALS
MR CHARLES BATCHELOR WAS MR EDISON'S PRINCIPAL ASSISTANT AT THAT TIME
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS A GENTLEMAN CAME TO ME A NUMBER OF YEARS AFTERWARD AND I GOT OUT A PART OF SOME PLANS FOR HIM
THE NEXT DAY THE DOCTOR ARRIVED AND NOTICING THE SMELL ASKED WHAT WAS DEAD
THESE WOULD EXPLODE AND I WAS TWICE HIT BY THE BULLETS WHICH LEFT A BLACK-AND-BLUE MARK

ALL WAS WELL SO LONG AS ORDINARY CONDITIONS PREVAILED BUT WHEN AN UNUSUAL PRESSURE OCCURRED THE LITTLE SYSTEM FELL BEHIND AND THE NEWSPAPERS COMPLAINED OF THE SLOWNESS WITH WHICH REPORTS WERE DELIVERED TO THEM
THE RESULT OF THIS RESISTANCE IS TO CONVERT OR TRANSLATE A PORTION OF THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY INTO ANOTHER FORM--NAMELY HEAT WHICH IN THE CONDUCTORS IS USELESS AND WASTEFUL AND TO SOME EXTENT INEVITABLE IN PRACTICE BUT IS TO BE AVOIDED AND REMEDIED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
I AM THANKFUL THAT I HAVE LIVED TO SEE THIS DAY BUT EDISON KEPT A CLOSE WATCH ON THE MOTOR

A PLATE OF CAKES A CUP OF COFFEE AND A RUSSIAN BATH FOR TEN CENTS THIS WAS ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT
WHILE MESSRS
LONG BEFORE HIS ADVENT IN CEMENT PRODUCTION EDISON HAD HELD VERY PRONOUNCED VIEWS ON THE VALUE OF THAT MATERIAL AS THE ONE WHICH WOULD OBTAIN LARGELY FOR FUTURE BUILDING PURPOSES ON ACCOUNT OF ITS STABILITY
OVER FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WHEN MR EDISON IS THINKING SERIOUSLY OVER A PROBLEM HE IS IN THE HABIT OF PULLING HIS RIGHT EYEBROW WHICH HE DID NOW FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY SECONDS
ONE INSTANCE WAS THAT THE SON OF ONE OF THESE EXPERTS WAS EMPLOYED IN THE OFFICE AND WHEN HE WAS TOLD TO DO ANYTHING WOULD NOT DO IT OR WOULD GIVE AN INSOLENT REPLY
HE WOULD INFINITELY RATHER BE PHILOSOPHER THAN PRODUCER
HENCE IF ANY ONE LIGHT GOES OUT THE CONTINUITY OF THE PATH IS BROKEN CURRENT CANNOT FLOW AND ALL THE LAMPS ARE EXTINGUISHED UNLESS A LOOP OR BY-PATH IS PROVIDED

THIS WAS PLAYED RIGHT THROUGH TO CHICAGO WITHOUT ANY SLEEP BUT THE BOYS DIDN'T MIND THAT
EDISON WAS PERHAPS NEARER THE VERGE OF GREAT ELECTRIC-RAILWAY POSSIBILITIES THAN ANY OTHER AMERICAN
ON ARRIVAL HE SAID TO ME
5 1882 317,631 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP OCT
I GAVE HIM AN INFERIOR JOB AND KEPT HIM FOR A LONG TIME EDISON HAD NOW ENTERED DEFINITELY UPON THAT CAREER AS AN INVENTOR WHICH HAS LEFT SO DEEP AN IMPRINT ON THE RECORDS OF THE UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE WHERE FROM HIS FIRST PATENT IN 1869 UP TO THE SUMMER OF 1910 NO FEWER THAN 1328 SEPARATE PATENTS HAVE BEEN APPLIED FOR IN HIS NAME AVERAGING THIRTY-TWO EVERY YEAR AND ONE ABOUT EVERY ELEVEN DAYS
THIS EMPIRICAL METHOD MAY PERHAPS BE BETTER ILLUSTRATED BY A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE
A PERMANENT MAGNET MADE OF STEEL WHICH AS DISTINGUISHED FROM SOFT IRON RETAINS ITS MAGNETISM FOR LONG PERIODS IS SO CALLED BECAUSE IT IS PERMANENTLY MAGNETIZED AND ITS POLARITY REMAINS FIXED
MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE-WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MR EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
HIS WORK AND TESTS REGARDING MAGNETISM WERE REPEATED LATER ON BY HOPKINSON AND KAPP WHO THEN ELUCIDATED THE WHOLE THEORY MATHEMATICALLY BY MEANS OF FORMULAE AND CONSTANTS
THE VERY FACT THAT TWO DISTINCT INTERESTS WERE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE WORK OF ORGANIZING AND ESTABLISHING COMPETING TELEPHONE EXCHANGES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY GREATLY FACILITATED THE SPREAD OF THE IDEA AND THE GROWTH OF THE BUSINESS AND FAMILIARIZED THE PEOPLE WITH THE USE OF THE TELEPHONE AS A BUSINESS AGENCY
MR UPTON SAYS
FARMER WAS NOT ONE OF THE PARTY THAT MEMORABLE DAY IN SEPTEMBER BUT HIS WORK WAS KNOWN THROUGH HIS INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH WALLACE AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT REFERENCE WAS MADE TO IT
THEY REMAIN LIGHTED EACH ONE INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER

REFERRING THE READER TO A PREVIOUS CHAPTER FOR A DISCUSSION OF EDISON'S STANDING AS A PIONEER INVENTOR IN THIS ART LET US GLANCE AT THE COMMERCIAL PROPORTIONS OF THIS YOUNG BUT LUSTY BUSINESS WHOSE RAMIFICATIONS EXTEND TO ALL BUT THE MOST REMOTE AND PRIMITIVE HAMLETS OF OUR COUNTRY
OH THEY SAID THIS THING IS A FAILURE
BERGMANN CAME TO WORK FOR ME AS A BOY SAYS EDISON
BROWN PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK CENTRAL RAILROAD AND MARVIN HUGHITT PRESIDENT OF THE CHICAGO NORTH WESTERN RAILROAD
TWO WEEKS AFTERWARD MR EDISON PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF THE SHOP
HE HAD ONE SONG THAT HE WOULD SING WHILE WE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER
ONE TIME THERE WAS TO BE A CONVENTION OF THE MANAGERS OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES AT CHICAGO
THE AWARD TO EDISON WAS NOT ONLY FOR HIS INVENTIONS IN DUPLEX AND QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPHY AND FOR THE PHONOGRAPH BUT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMERCIALLY PRACTICAL INCANDESCENT LAMP AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING INCLUDING DYNAMOS REGULATING DEVICES UNDERGROUND SYSTEM PROTECTIVE DEVICES AND METERS
I THEN YELLED
CLOCKS THAT SHOULD ANNOUNCE IN ARTICULATE SPEECH THE TIME FOR GOING HOME GOING TO MEALS ETC
SO THE OLD FLOORING WAS TORN OUT AND A NEW ONE OF HEAVY GIRDERS SUPPORTED BY STIFF COLUMNS WAS SUBSTITUTED
AFTER THIS GOULD WANTED ME TO HELP INSTALL THE AUTOMATIC SYSTEM IN THE ATLANTIC PACIFIC COMPANY OF WHICH GENERAL ECKERT HAD BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT THE COMPANY HAVING BOUGHT THE AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY
AND THE THIRD IN WHICH THEY SAID IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN DONE BY EVERYBODY
18 1875 168,385 DUPLEX TELEGRAPHS
BROCKTON HAD A GOOD DEAL OF PRIDE IN ITS FINE TREES AND A STRONG SENTIMENT WAS VERY SOON AROUSED AGAINST THE MUTILATION PROPOSED SO THOUGHTLESSLY
4 1891 476,986 MEANS FOR PROPELLING ELECTRIC CARS FEB
IN THE FOREGOING DETAILS THE READER HAS BEEN AFFORDED BUT A PASSING GLANCE AT THE GREAT PRACTICAL WORKING EQUIPMENT WHICH CONSTITUTES THE THEATRE OF EDISON'S ACTIVITIES FOR IN TAKING A GENERAL VIEW OF SUCH A UNIQUE AND COMPREHENSIVE LABORATORY PLANT ITS SALIENT FEATURES ONLY CAN BE TOUCHED UPON TO ADVANTAGE
THREE CARS WERE IN SERVICE DURING THE ENTIRE TIME OF OPERATING THIS 1880 RAILROAD
EACH MACHINE WAS OPERATED BY A CLERK WHO TRANSLATED THE MESSAGE INTO TELEGRAPHIC CHARACTERS AND PREPARED THE TRANSMITTING TAPE BY PUNCHING THE NECESSARY PERFORATIONS THEREIN
FISH ON HIS RETURN FROM ST LOUIS AFTER HE HAD ARGUED THE EDISON SIDE HE FELT KEENLY THAT DISADVANTAGE TO SAY NOTHING OF THE HOPELESS DIFFICULTY OF EDUCATING THE COURT IN THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THE ART WHEN IT WAS APPARENT THAT INCANDESCENT LIGHTING HAD COME TO STAY THE EDISON COMPANY WAS A SHINING MARK AT WHICH THE SHAFTS OF THE DISHONEST WERE AIMED
MORGAN'S OFFICE NOTED IN THE LAST CHAPTER
BUT IN MANY OF THE EARLIER SYSTEMS LIKE THAT OF BAIN THE RECORD AT THE HIGHER RATES OF SPEED WAS EFFECTED BY CHEMICAL MEANS A TELL-TALE STAIN BEING MADE ON THE TRAVELLING STRIP OF PAPER BY EVERY SPURT OF INCOMING CURRENT
MR EDISON LED ME TO A HEAP OF JUNK IN A CORNER AND SAID
DURING 1858 FARMER WHO LIKE EDISON WAS A CEASELESS INVESTIGATOR HAD MADE A SERIES OF STUDIES UPON THE PRODUCTION OF LIGHT BY ELECTRICITY AND HAD EVEN INVENTED AN AUTOMATIC REGULATOR BY WHICH A NUMBER OF PLATINUM LAMPS IN MULTIPLE ARC COULD BE KEPT AT UNIFORM VOLTAGE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
A DEVICE FOR PROJECTING SOUND-WAVES TO A DISTANCE WITHOUT SPREADING AND IN A STRAIGHT LINE ON THE PRINCIPLE OF SMOKE RINGS
THE HEAT OF WHATEVER ORIGIN IS APPLIED FROM BELOW AND THE SHAFT BEING REVOLVED FOUR OF THE ARMATURES LOSE THEIR MAGNETISM CONSTANTLY WHILE THE OTHER FOUR GAIN IT SO TO SPEAK
BY MEANS OF THE LARGE MASSES OF IRON IN THE FIELD-MAGNETS AND CLOSELY FITTED JOINTS BETWEEN THE SEVERAL PARTS THEREOF THE MAGNETIC RESISTANCE RELUCTANCE OF THE IRON PARTS OF THE MAGNETIC CIRCUIT WAS REDUCED TO A MINIMUM AND THE REQUIRED MAGNETIZATION EFFECTED WITH THE MAXIMUM ECONOMY
THEY ADORED MR EDISON AS THE GREATEST MAN OF ALL TIME IN EVERY POSSIBLE DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE ART AND PHILOSOPHY AND EXECRATED MR GRAHAM BELL THE INVENTOR OF THE RIVAL TELEPHONE AS HIS SATANIC ADVERSARY
THE OTHERS WANTED TO PULL UP ANCHOR BUT I FISHED TWO DAYS AND TWO NIGHTS WITHOUT A BITE UNTIL THEY PULLED UP ANCHOR AND WENT AWAY
IT HAD BEEN STEPPED ON AND FLATTENED
THE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS OF THE WORLD IN THE LAST QUARTER OF A CENTURY OWING TO THE REVOLUTION CAUSED BY THE ALL-CONQUERING MARCH OF HEAVY CURRENT ENGINEERING IS THE OUTCOME OF EDISON'S WORK AT MENLO PARK THAT RAISED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DYNAMO FROM 40 PER CENT
WITH CHARACTERISTIC BOLDNESS AND FORESIGHT HE PLANNED THE ERECTION OF THE SERIES OF MAGNIFICENT CONCRETE BUILDINGS THAT NOW STAND ADJACENT TO AND AROUND THE LABORATORY AND IN WHICH THE MANUFACTURING PLANT IS AT PRESENT HOUSED
IN LIKE MANNER IF THE TRANSMITTER AT B BE CLOSED CURRENT WOULD FLOW THROUGH SIMILAR PARTS AND THUS CAUSE THE RELAY AT A TO RESPOND
THEY WERE CRUDELY CONSTRUCTED AND THEIR LIFE WAS BRIEF
HENCE IN A PRIMITIVE MULTIPLE-ARC SYSTEM IT WAS FOUND THAT THE SYSTEM MUST HAVE CONDUCTORS OF A SIZE EQUAL TO THE AGGREGATE OF THE INDIVIDUAL CONDUCTORS NECESSARY FOR EVERY LAMP
WITH THE EXPERIENCE THUS GAINED EDISON BEGAN IN THE SPRING OF 1881 AT THE EDISON MACHINE WORKS GOERCK STREET NEW YORK CITY THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL MACHINE OF THIS TYPE
IT IS IMMATERIAL WHICH WAY THE WIRE IS WOUND AROUND THE BAR THE DETERMINING FACTOR OF POLARITY BEING THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT
AND IN THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF SUCH ENERGY TO TELEGRAPHY AND KINDRED USES MUCH THOUGHT AND INGENUITY HAD BEEN EXPENDED IN STUDYING COMBINATIONS OF CONNECTING SUCH CELLS SO AS TO GET THE BEST RESULTS
AT THE BOTTOM THERE WAS A SPACE WHERE TWO MEN COULD GO THROUGH A HOLE
HE BECAME A SPIRITUALIST SUBSEQUENTLY WHICH PROBABLY EXPLAINS IT IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT EDISON BECAME GREATLY INTERESTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENTS BY MARCONI AND IS AN ADMIRING FRIEND AND ADVISER OF THAT WELL-KNOWN INVENTOR
BUT THIS COURT SHOULD ALSO CONTAIN AT LEAST TWO SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO WOULD NOT BE BLIND TO THE SOPHISTRY OF PAID EXPERTS
AFTER LEAVING TORONTO A TERRIFIC BLIZZARD CAME UP AND THE TRAIN GOT SNOWED UNDER IN A CUT
TO STIMULATE US TO GREATER IMPROVEMENT EDISON HUNG UP A CARD WHICH SHOWED THE RESULTS OF TESTS IN MILLIAMPERE-HOURS GIVEN BY THE EXPERIMENTAL ELEMENTS AS WE TRIED THEM WITH THE VARIOUS GRADES OF NICKEL AND IRON WE HAD MADE
TO-DAY SUCH A CROWD OF WORKING-MEN WOULD BE SURE TO INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE STUDENT OF A NIGHT SCHOOL OR CORRESPONDENCE COURSE WHO WOULD EXPLAIN THE MYSTERY OFFHAND
INDEED AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WAS FOUND THAT BY WINDING THE POLAR RELAY DIFFERENTIALLY AND ARRANGING THE CIRCUITS AND COLLATERAL APPLIANCES APPROPRIATELY THE POLAR DUPLEX SYSTEM WAS MORE HIGHLY EFFICIENT THAN THE NEUTRAL SYSTEM AND IT IS EXTENSIVELY USED TO THE PRESENT DAY
ANOTHER PIONEER PLANT WAS THAT EQUIPPED AND STARTED IN JANUARY 1881 FOR HINDS KETCHAM A NEW YORK FIRM OF LITHOGRAPHERS AND COLOR PRINTERS WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ABLE TO WORK ONLY BY DAY OWING TO DIFFICULTIES IN COLOR-PRINTING BY ARTIFICIAL LIGHT
HE THOUGHT IT ABSURD
19 1874 178,223 DUPLEX TELEGRAPHS
FOR EXAMPLE THE EDISON GRANULAR TRANSMITTER WAS A VARIETY OF MICROPHONE AS WAS ALSO EDISON'S TRANSMITTER IN WHICH THE SOLID BUTTON OF CARBON WAS EMPLOYED
I GOT THE JOB ANOTHER MAN WHO SUCCEEDED IN WINNING A PLACE AS ASSISTANT WAS MR JOHN F
AT EIGHTY I EXPECT TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY BRIDGE WHIST AND TALK FOOLISHLY TO THE LADIES
AT THE OUTBREAK OF THE WAR IN 1861 HE WAS PRESIDENT OF ONE OF THE PRESBYTERIAN SYNODICAL COLLEGES IN THE SOUTH WHOSE BUILDINGS PASSED INTO THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
EVERY STORE I TRADED WITH WAS ALWAYS GLAD TO FURNISH GOODS PERHAPS IN AMAZED ADMIRATION OF MY SYSTEM OF DOING BUSINESS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY NEW AFTER A WHILE EDISON GOT A BOOKKEEPER WHOSE VAGARIES MADE HIM LOOK BACK WITH REGRET ON THE EARLIER PRIMITIVE METHOD
THE PRODUCTIONS OF THE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY ALONE AVERAGE ANNUAL SALES OF NEARLY $75,000,000 BUT THEY DO NOT COMPRISE THE TOTAL OF THE COUNTRY'S MANUFACTURES IN THESE LINES
ABOUT 7 OR 7.30 A.M
I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO NOTICE IT WAS NO UNCOMMON SIGHT TO SEE IN THE PARLORS IN THE EVENING JOHN PIERPONT MORGAN NORVIN GREEN GROSVENOR P
THE NIGHT WAS INTENSELY HOT AND CLOSE
IN FACT I WAS A VERY POOR SENDER AND THEREFORE MADE THE TAKING OF PRESS REPORT A SPECIALTY
AS THE LIGHTING BUSINESS INCREASED HOWEVER AND A GREAT NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL MEN WERE INITIATED INTO ITS MYSTERIES EDISON AND HIS EXPERTS WERE ABLE TO SPARE SOME TIME TO LEGAL MATTERS AND AN ERA OF ACTIVE PATENT LITIGATION AGAINST INFRINGERS WAS OPENED ABOUT THE YEAR 1885 BY THE EDISON COMPANY AND THEREAFTER CONTINUED FOR MANY YEARS
MAY 24 1890 436,970 APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING POWER JUNE 2 1890 453,741 PHONOGRAPH JULY 5 1890 454,942 PHONOGRAPH JULY 5 1890 456,301 PHONOGRAPH DOLL
BUT TO SHOW THAT IN A PRACTICAL SENSE THE SUGGESTION OF THE ART ITSELF WAS ORIGINAL WITH HIM
IF AS A FORMER COMMISSIONER ONCE SAID EDISON WAS THE MAN WHO KEPT THE PATH TO THE PATENT OFFICE HOT WITH HIS FOOTSTEPS THERE WERE OTHER GREAT INVENTORS ABREAST OR IMMEDIATELY ON HIS HEELS SOME TO BE SURE WITH LEGITIMATE ORIGINAL METHODS AND VITAL IMPROVEMENTS REPRESENTING INDEPENDENT WORK
NOR WAS THERE A CENTRAL SWITCHBOARD
11 1889 1890 434,588 MAGNETIC ORE SEPARATOR--EDISON AND W
NOTHING WAS WANTING BUT THE CLATTER OF HOOFS UPON THE TURF AND AN OCCASIONAL BREATH OF STEAM FROM THE NOSTRILS TO MAKE THE SPECTATOR BELIEVE THAT HE HAD BEFORE HIM GENUINE FLESH-AND-BLOOD STEEDS
THE SKIN HOWEVER PEELED OFF AND NEW SKIN REPLACED IT WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE CHAPTER VII THE STOCK TICKER THE LETTERS AND FIGURES USED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE TAPE SAID A WELL-KNOWN BOSTON STOCK SPECULATOR ARE VERY FEW BUT THEY SPELL RUIN IN NINETY-NINE MILLION WAYS IT IS NOT TO BE INFERRED HOWEVER THAT THE MODERN STOCK TICKER HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MAKING OR LOSING OF FORTUNES
EFFORTS WERE THEN MADE TO SELL THEM BUT THE PRICES WERE HIGH--FROM $100 TO $150
I MADE ABOUT A POUND OF IT
INSTEAD OF THAT IT WAS TWENTY-SEVEN FEET LONG
THUS IN A CURIOUS MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE RIVALRIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRED IN A FIELD WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF FORCES WAS INEVITABLE
ADAMS ONE OF EDISON'S EARLIEST AND CLOSEST FRIENDS TO WHOM REFERENCE WILL BE MADE IN LATER CHAPTERS AND WHOSE LIFE HAS BEEN SO FULL OF ADVENTUROUS EPISODES THAT HE MIGHT WELL BE REGARDED AS THE MODERN GIL BLAS
FROM 1850 ONWARD THE IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH THE ARC LAMP AND THE DYNAMO WERE RAPID
IT IS SOMETHING LIKE EXHIBITING THE GEOLOGICAL ERAS OF THE EARTH IN AN OUTLINE LANTERN SLIDE TO REDUCE AN ELABORATE SERIES OF STRENUOUS EXPERIMENTS AND A VAST VARIETY OF INGENIOUS APPARATUS TO THE SPACE OF A FEW HUNDRED WORDS
INDEED EVEN THE PLATINUM POINT WHICH IN THE EARLY FORM OF THE REIS TRANSMITTER PRESSED AGAINST THE PLATINUM CONTACT CEMENTED TO THE CENTRE OF THE DIAPHRAGM WAS A MICROPHONE AT A TIME WHEN MOST PEOPLE WERE AMAZED AT THE IDEA OF HEARING WITH THE AID OF A MICROPHONE A FLY WALK AT A DISTANCE OF MANY MILES THE PRIORITY OF INVENTION OF SUCH A DEVICE WAS HOTLY DISPUTED
ONE OF THE NEWSPAPERS COMPLAINED OF BAD COPY TOWARD THE END OF THE REPORT--THAT IS FROM 1 TO 3 A.M AND REQUESTED THAT THE OPERATOR TAKING THE REPORT UP TO 1 A.M.--WHICH WAS OURSELVES--TAKE IT ALL AS THE COPY THEN WAS PERFECTLY UNOBJECTIONABLE
POSSIBLY EVENTS MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED DIFFERENTLY HAD EDISON BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS ELECTRIC-LIGHT INVENTIONS UNTIL HE WAS ENTIRELY PREPARED TO BRING OUT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE READY FOR COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION BUT THE NEWS OF HIS PRODUCTION OF A PRACTICAL AND SUCCESSFUL INCANDESCENT LAMP BECAME KNOWN AND SPREAD LIKE WILD-FIRE TO ALL CORNERS OF THE GLOBE
ON THESE TRAINS I EMPLOYED A BOY WHO SOLD BREAD TOBACCO AND STICK CANDY
THIS PLANT AT THE PRESENT TIME EMBRACES OVER 275 ACRES OF WHICH SIXTY ACRES ARE COVERED BY FIFTY LARGE AND OVER ONE HUNDRED SMALL BUILDINGS
THE NECESSITY FOR THIS WAS DUE TO THE MANY RADICAL VARIATIONS MADE FROM ACCEPTED METHODS
AND IT WAS ALL MORE OR LESS A MATTER OF GUESSWORK ALTHOUGH THE CENTRAL-STATION MANAGER AIMING TO GIVE GOOD SERVICE WOULD NATURALLY SEE THAT THE DYNAMOS WERE SO OPERATED AS TO MAINTAIN AS STEADILY AS POSSIBLE THE NORMAL POTENTIAL AND CURRENT
HOW MUCH SO MAY BE JUDGED FROM THE FACT THAT IN THE THREE THOUSAND ACRES IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING THE MILLS THAT I AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED AT EDISON THERE WERE OVER 200,000,000 TONS OF LOW-GRADE ORE
WHEN I GOT THROUGH I WAS TOO NERVOUS TO GO HOME SO WAITED THE REST OF THE NIGHT FOR THE DAY MANAGER MR STEVENS TO SEE WHAT WAS TO BE THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNION FORMATION AND OF MY EFFORTS
HE WAS QUITE THIN IN THOSE DAYS AND HIS NOSE WAS VERY PROMINENT GIVING A NAPOLEONIC LOOK TO HIS FACE ALTHOUGH THE CURIOUS RESEMBLANCE DID NOT STRIKE ME AT THE TIME
BUT THE DESIRED ECONOMY SIMPLICITY AND DURABILITY WERE NOT OBTAINED IN THIS MANNER ALTHOUGH AT ALL TIMES THE BURNER WAS MAINTAINED AT A CRITICALLY HIGH TEMPERATURE
THEN CAME THE GREAT OUTBURST OF ACTIVITY
A MAN EMERGES FROM THE WATER WITH A SPLASH ASCENDS FEET FOREMOST TEN YARDS OR MORE MAKES A GRACEFUL CURVE AND LANDS ON A SPRING-BOARD RUNS DOWN IT TO THE BANK AND HIS CLOTHES FLY GENTLY UP FROM THE GROUND AND ENCLOSE HIS PERSON--ALL UNTHINKABLE IN REAL LIFE BUT READILY POSSIBLE BY RUNNING THE MOTION-PICTURE FILM BACKWARD
HE APPRECIATED FULLY ITS INHERENT DIFFICULTIES NOT ONLY IN MANUFACTURE BUT ALSO IN THE MARKETING OF THE PRODUCT
BUT THIS FATE HAS DOGGED HIM UNTIL HE HAS COME AT LAST TO RESIGN HIMSELF TO IT WITH A RESENTFUL INDIGNATION ONLY TO BE APPRECIATED WHEN WATCHING HIM READ THE LATEST FULL-PAGE SUNDAY SPREAD THAT DEVELOPS A CASUAL CONVERSATION INTO ORACULAR VERBOSITY AND GIVES TO HIS SHREWD SURMISE THE CAST OF INSPIRED PROPHECY
NUMEROUS OTHER PATENTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO HIM FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN TELEPHONES BUT THE ONE ABOVE SPECIFIED MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THEM SINCE IT IS THE ONE THAT FIRST DISCLOSES THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CARBON TRANSMITTER
I HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN IN NEW YORK
THE PERFORATED PAPER WAS PREPARED AT THE RATE OF TWENTY WORDS PER MINUTE
25 1882 406,825 ELECTRIC METER AUG
THIS WAS ALSO INVENTED LATER BY ANOTHER INVENTOR AND IS IN USE TO-DAY BUT WILL NATURALLY BE RIVALLED BY WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
IN HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH KRUESI AS LATE AS 1887 WE FIND EDISON BEWAILING THE INADEQUACY OF THE INSULATION OF THE CONDUCTORS UNDER TWELVE HUNDRED VOLTS PRESSURE AS FOR EXAMPLE
IT WAS FELT THAT AFTER ALL THAT WHICH THE GREAT EXPOSITION EXEMPLIFIED AT ITS BEST--THE TRIUMPH OF GENIUS OVER MATTER OVER IGNORANCE OVER SUPERSTITION--MET WITH ITS DUE RECOGNITION WHEN EDISON CAME TO PARTICIPATE AND TO FELICITATE A NOBLE NATION THAT COULD SHOW SO MUCH IN THE VICTORIES OF CIVILIZATION AND THE ARTS DESPITE ITS LONG TRIALS AND ITS LONG STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY
AT THIS TIME HOWEVER THE PATENT HAD ONLY ABOUT A YEAR OF LIFE LEFT OWING TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE CORRESPONDING ENGLISH PATENT
EACH NEGATIVE CONTAINS TWENTY-FOUR POCKETS--A POCKET BEING 1/2 INCH WIDE BY 3 INCHES LONG AND HAVING A MAXIMUM THICKNESS OF A LITTLE MORE THAN 1/8 INCH
SOME WERE MERE CONSUMERS OF TIME
THE INVENTION WHEN COMPLETED WAS TAKEN TO WASHINGTON
RATHER HAS IT BEEN TAKEN AS A POINT OF DEPARTURE INTO A REALM OF FANCY AND ROMANCE WHERE AS A RELIEF FROM DRUDGERY HE IS SOMETIMES QUITE WILLING TO PLAY THE PIPE IF SOME ONE WILL DANCE TO IT
THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE WAS NOT READY FOR IT AGAIN IN HIS SIGNALLING WITHOUT WIRES IN GIVING THE HISTORY OF THE COHERER PRINCIPLE LODGE REMARKS
EDISON DEVISED A MACHINE TO ANSWER THE PURPOSE AND PUT LONG SPOKES ON IT FITTED IT UP AND SHIPPED IT TO CHINA
BUT HELMHOLTZ COULD NOT SEE ONE OF THEM
EDISON'S AMUSING DESCRIPTION OF HIS EXPERIENCE IN SHIPPING THE DYNAMO TO PARIS WHEN BUILT MAY APPROPRIATELY BE GIVEN HERE
EDISON DOES NOT FORGET WHAT IS GOING ON
THE LIST OF WELL-KNOWN AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN GRADUATES OF THE KEY IS INDEED AN EXTRAORDINARY ONE AND THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT OF OUR NATIONAL LIFE IN WHICH THEY HAVE NOT DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES
HE WAS NOT WILLING TO SAY LET US REST AND BE THANKFUL AS WAS ONE OF ENGLAND'S GREAT LIBERAL LEADERS AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF REFORM
OUT OF ALL THIS IN NEW YORK CAME A BOARD OF ELECTRICAL CONTROL A CONDUIT SYSTEM AND IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION THAT IS CREDITED TO GOVERNOR HUGHES AS THE FURTHEST DEVELOPMENT OF UTILITY CORPORATION CONTROL
IF THE VISITOR PERSISTS UNTIL EDISON HAS SEEN BOTH SIDES OF THE CONTROVERSY HE IS ALWAYS WILLING TO FRANKLY ADMIT THAT HIS OWN VIEWS MAY BE UNSOUND AND THAT HIS OPPONENT IS RIGHT
IT WAS ALSO PAID SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASH FOR THE EDISON PHELPS GRAY AND OTHER APPARATUS ON HAND
IF SO MR EDISON HAS DISCOVERED SOMETHING MORE THAN PERPETUAL MOTION AND MR KEELY HAD BETTER RETIRE FROM THE FIELD
I GOT UP AN ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE WITH A GRIP ON THE RAIL BY WHICH IT WENT UP THE 45 PER CENT
MECHANICAL SEPARATION OF PHOSPHORUS
MR EDISON LOOKS BACK ON THIS WITH GREAT SATISFACTION
2 PORTUGAL 10 QUEENSLAND 29 RUSSIA 17 SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC 4 SOUTH AUSTRALIA
TO STOP MEANT NOT ONLY TO POCKET A GREAT LOSS ALREADY INCURRED FACING A DARK AND UNCERTAIN FUTURE BUT TO MOST MEN ANIMATED BY ORDINARY HUMAN FEELINGS IT MEANT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AN INJURY TO PERSONAL PRIDE
EXTRA IF HIS TAXES IN NEWARK WERE NOT AT ONCE PAID HE ACTUALLY FORGOT HIS OWN NAME WHEN ASKED FOR IT SUDDENLY AT THE CITY HALL LOST HIS PLACE IN THE LINE AND THE FATAL HOUR STRIKING HAD TO PAY THE SURCHARGE AFTER ALL
WOULD THUS BE ASSURED BUT THE ADDITION OF A THIRD OR COMPENSATING CONDUCTOR OF THE SAME CROSS-SECTION AS ONE OF THE OUTSIDE MAINS REDUCES THE TOTAL SAVING TO 62 1/2 PER CENT
THE REPRESENTATIVES OF NEW YORK COULD WITH JUSTICE DRINK THE HEALTH OF THE YOUNG INVENTOR WHOSE SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BOONS THE CITY HAS EVER HAD CONFERRED UPON IT
I HAVE THE HONOR WELL HE SAID MY BILL HAS GONE FROM $20 UP TO $28 $35 $45
MAY 28 1872 131,337 PRINTING TELEGRAPHS
WE WERE TOLD IN THE MORNING THAT JACK WAS A PRETTY GOOD FELLOW AND WAS NOT ONE OF THE BAD MEN OF WHOM THEY HAD A GOOD SUPPLY
THIS PARTICULAR DEVICE WAS INVENTED BY MR JOHN B
THE EDISON PHONOGRAPH IS AN IMPORTANT EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE
WE MANAGED TO FIND A LATHE BUT THERE WAS NO POWER
INDEED IT IS NOT POSSIBLE WITHIN OUR LIMITED SPACE TO PRESENT EVEN A BRIEF DIGEST OF EDISON'S GREAT AND COMPREHENSIVE WORK ON THE DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINE AS EMBODIED IN HIS EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS AND IN OVER ONE HUNDRED PATENTS GRANTED TO HIM
I MADE ONE BREAK
WHEN A SINGLE MESSAGE IS SENT FROM ONE STATION TO THE OTHER OR WHEN BOTH STATIONS ARE SENDING MESSAGES THAT DO NOT CONFLICT ONLY ONE BATTERY OR THE OTHER IS CONNECTED TO THE MAIN LINE
THE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRICAL EXPOSITION AT PARIS WAS INTENDED TO PLACE BEFORE THE EYES OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE CENTURY
THE STUDY OF GEOGRAPHY SCENES AND INCIDENTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES SHOWING THE LIVES AND CUSTOMS AND SURROUNDINGS OF OTHER PEOPLES IS OBVIOUSLY MORE ENTERTAINING TO THE CHILD WHEN ACTIVELY DEPICTED ON THE SCREEN THAN WHEN MERELY DESCRIBED IN WORDS
THE FAMILY NEVER CONSISTED OF MORE THAN THREE CHILDREN TWO BOYS AND A GIRL
PERHAPS NO ONE HAS BEEN SEVERER IN THIS DIRECTION THAN MYSELF
HE READ STEADILY UNTIL BREAKFAST-TIME AND THEN HE REMARKED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
BUT ALTHOUGH THE POURED CEMENT HOUSE WAS PLANNED DURING THE COMMERCIAL PERIOD THE SPIRIT IN WHICH IT WAS CONCEIVED AROSE OUT OF AN EARNEST DESIRE TO PLACE WITHIN THE REACH OF THE WAGE-EARNER AN OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER HIS PHYSICAL PECUNIARY AND MENTAL CONDITIONS IN SO FAR AS THAT COULD BE DONE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF HYGIENIC AND BEAUTIFUL HOMES AT MODERATE RENTALS
OF ONE INCIDENT IN HIS CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS HE TELLS THE FOLLOWING STORY
EDISON'S STANDPOINT TO-DAY IS THAT AN EVIL TO BE DREADED IN MANUFACTURE IS THAT OF OVER-STANDARDIZATION AND THAT AS SOON AS AN ARTICLE IS PERFECT THAT IS THE TIME TO BEGIN IMPROVING IT
IT IS CURIOUS AND PERTINENT TO NOTE THAT A SIMILAR PLEBISCITE TAKEN BY A TECHNICAL JOURNAL AMONG ITS EXPERT READERS HAD EXACTLY THE SAME RESULT
TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUN
TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUN
THE OUTLINE SKETCH WILL INDICATE THE PRINCIPAL PATENTS COVERING THE BASIC FEATURES OF THE LAMP
WITH THESE FACTS IN MIND WE SHALL ASK THE READER TO ASSIGN TO EDISON A DUE PROPORTION OF CREDIT FOR HIS PIONEER AND BASIC WORK IN RELATION TO THE PRODIGIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRIC RAILROADING THAT HAS SINCE TAKEN PLACE
I BROUGHT MY APPARATUS OVER AND WAS GIVEN A SEPARATE ROOM WITH A MARBLE-TILED FLOOR WHICH BY-THE-WAY WAS A VERY HARD KIND OF FLOOR TO SLEEP ON AND STARTED IN PUTTING ON THE FINISHING TOUCHES
TO USE A LOWER VOLTAGE OR PRESSURE WHILE MAKING THE SOLUTION OF THE LIGHTING PROBLEM A SIMPLE ONE AS WE SHALL SEE WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE CONDUCTING WIRES TO A PROHIBITIVE EXTENT
FOOTNOTE 30
INDEED IT WILL BE NOTED THAT THE EXAMPLE OF HIS HANDWRITING SHOWN IN THESE VOLUMES DEALS WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING AVAILABLE ENERGY DIRECT FROM THE COMBUSTIBLE WITHOUT THE ENORMOUS LOSS IN THE INTERVENING STAGES THAT MAKES OUR BEST MODERN METHODS OF STEAM GENERATION AND UTILIZATION SO BARBAROUSLY EXTRAVAGANT AND WASTEFUL
CLARKE AND OTHERS WITHOUT WHOSE AID THE ISSUANCE OF THIS BOOK WOULD INDEED HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE
THE DAY ARRIVED
JUNE 17 1901 701,804 REVERSIBLE GALVANIC BATTERY
2 COMPRISES PRACTICALLY TWO CIRCUITS COMBINED IN ONE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE CENTRAL CONDUCTOR PN IN CASE OF EMERGENCY SERVES IN TWO CAPACITIES--NAMELY AS NEGATIVE TO GENERATOR G<1S> OR AS POSITIVE TO GENERATOR G<2S> ALTHOUGH NORMALLY NEUTRAL
WHEN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MOMENT ARRIVED I HADN'T THE NERVE TO NAME SUCH A LARGE SUM SO I SAID
I HAD ONLY A VERY SHORT PERIOD IN WHICH TO GET IT READY AND PUT IT ON A STEAMER TO REACH THE EXPOSITION IN TIME
TO PAY RAILROAD CHARGES ON ORES CARRYING PERHAPS 80 TO 90 PER CENT
THE IDEA OF FORMING THE RECORD ON TINFOIL HAD BEEN EARLY ABANDONED AND IN ITS STEAD WAS SUBSTITUTED A CYLINDER OF WAX-LIKE MATERIAL IN WHICH THE RECORD WAS CUT BY A MINUTE CHISEL-LIKE GOUGING TOOL
THE MIXTURE WAS TO BE POURED INTO THE HOPPER UNTIL THE ENTIRE FORM WAS FILLED SUCH MIXTURE FLOWING DOWN AND ALONG THE HORIZONTAL LEGS AND UP THE VERTICAL MEMBERS
I WAS NEVER SO TAKEN ABACK IN MY LIFE
THIS IS ASCERTAINED BY MEANS OF A MICROMETER SCREW S WHICH MOVES A NEEDLE T IN FRONT OF THE DIAL
I STARTED TO CARRY OUT THE PROCEDURE WHEN UPON OPENING THE OIL-CUP THE STEAM RUSHED OUT WITH A TREMENDOUS NOISE NEARLY KNOCKING ME OFF THE ENGINE
THIS BIRTHPLACE OF EDISON REMAINS THE PLAIN SUBSTANTIAL LITTLE BRICK HOUSE IT WAS ORIGINALLY
YOUR SALARY WILL BE $125 THUS I GOT FROM THE PLUG CLASSIFICATION TO THAT OF A FIRST-CLASS MAN BUT NO SOONER WAS THIS PROMOTION SECURED THAN HE STARTED AGAIN ON HIS WANDERINGS SOUTHWARD WHILE HIS FRIEND ADAMS WENT NORTH NEITHER HAVING ANY DIFFICULTY IN MAKING THE TRIP
A GREAT VARIETY OF METHODS FOR COATING INCANDESCENT LAMP FILAMENTS WITH SILICON TITANIUM CHROMIUM OSMIUM BORON ETC
WHEN MR EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS WERE REPEATED BY MR BATCHELOR WHO REPRESENTED HIM AT THE PARIS EXPOSITION OF 1881 THE DARK BOX WAS EMPLOYED FOR A SIMILAR PURPOSE AFTER RECORDING A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF OTHER EXPERIMENTS THE LABORATORY NOTES GO ON TO STATE
HE MAY BE QUOTED AT LENGTH AS FOLLOWS
NICHOLS WAS ALSO WITH US FOR A SHORT TIME CONDUCTING A SPECIAL SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS
WERE THE AGE CALLED UPON TO PAY THOMAS A
THREE RELATED TO ELECTRIC RAILWAYS AND SEVEN TO MISCELLANEOUS APPARATUS SUCH AS TELEGRAPH RELAYS MAGNETIC ORE SEPARATORS MAGNETO SIGNALLING APPARATUS ETC
AS WE WALKED TO KEEP THE APPOINTMENT HE GAVE ME THE FOLLOWING REMINISCENCE
THIS ROMAN LETTER SYSTEM WAS IN USE FOR SEVERAL YEARS ON LINES BETWEEN NEW YORK PHILADELPHIA AND WASHINGTON AND WAS SO EFFICIENT THAT A SPEED OF THREE THOUSAND WORDS A MINUTE WAS ATTAINED ON THE LINE BETWEEN THE TWO FIRST-NAMED CITIES
MANIFESTLY THERE MUST BE PROVIDED SOME CONVENIENT WAY FOR RAPIDLY TRANSPOSING THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT FLOW IF SUCH A DEVICE AS THE POLAR RELAY IS TO BE USED FOR THE RECEPTION OF TELEGRAPH MESSAGES AND THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF AN INSTRUMENT CALLED A POLE-CHANGER WHICH CONSISTS ESSENTIALLY OF A MOVABLE CONTACT PIECE CONNECTED PERMANENTLY TO THE EARTH OR GROUNDED AND ARRANGED TO CONNECT ONE OR THE OTHER POLE OF A BATTERY TO THE LINE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY GROUND THE OTHER POLE
HE ENTERED UPON HIS FIRST EXPERIENCE I THINK WITH MY BROTHER DUNCAN WHO IS NO TRIFLER WHEN HE COMES TO DEAL WITH THESE QUESTIONS AND FOR SEVERAL MONTHS MR CLARKE WAS PURSUED UP AND DOWN OVER A RANGE OF SUGGESTIONS OF WHAT HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IF HE HAD THOUGHT SOMETHING ELSE HAD BEEN SAID AT SOME TIME WHEN SOMETHING ELSE WAS NOT SAID MR DUNCAN--"I GOT THREE PAGES A DAY OUT OF HIM TOO MR LOWREY--"WELL IT WAS A GOOD RESULT

IT BEING SUMMER-TIME ALL THE MACHINE SHOPS WERE CLOSED UNTIL MONDAY MORNING AND THERE WERE SEVERAL MILES OF WIRE TO BE WOUND ON THE COIL
FOR YEARS HIS NAME WAS BRANDED ON EVERY BELL TELEPHONE SET AND HIS PATENTS WERE A MAINSTAY OF WHAT HAS BEEN POPULARLY CALLED THE BELL MONOPOLY SPEAKING OF HIS OWN EFFORTS IN THIS FIELD MR EDISON SAYS
AGAIN THE SHREWD COMMENT
MR MALLORY MENTIONS A LITTLE FACT THAT BEARS ON THIS EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY OF BODILY POWERS
THEY HAVE EARS ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG AND VERY SLENDER LEGS ABOUT THREE TIMES AS LONG AS THOSE OF AN ORDINARY RABBIT AND TRAVEL AT A GREAT SPEED BY A SERIES OF JUMPS EACH ABOUT THIRTY FEET LONG AS NEAR AS I COULD JUDGE
THE HONOR OF A SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY BELONGS NOT TO HIM WHO FIRST SEES A THING BUT TO HIM WHO FIRST SEES IT WITH EXPERT EYES
IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT HE GOES TO THE CORE OF THINGS AT ONCE ALTHOUGH NOTHING LESS THAN RESULTS FROM ACTUAL EXPERIMENTS ARE ACCEPTABLE TO HIM AS ESTABLISHED FACTS THIS VIEW OF EDISON MAY ALSO ACCOUNT FOR HIS PECULIAR AND SOMEWHAT WEIRD ABILITY TO GUESS CORRECTLY A FACULTY WHICH HAS FREQUENTLY ENABLED HIM TO TAKE SHORT CUTS TO LINES OF INVESTIGATION WHOSE OUTCOME HAS VERIFIED IN A MOST REMARKABLE DEGREE STATEMENTS APPARENTLY MADE OFFHAND AND WITHOUT CALCULATION

I ALSO FOUND THAT THIS TUNGSTATE COULD BE PUT INTO A VACUUM CHAMBER OF GLASS AND FUSED TO THE INNER WALLS OF THE CHAMBER
NEVERTHELESS MR EDISON WAS NOT DISCOURAGED AND DESPITE THE ACTIVE OPPOSITION MADE TO HIS LAMP DESPITE THE POLEMIC ACERBITY OF WHICH HE WAS THE OBJECT HE DID NOT CEASE TO PERFECT IT

DESIRING TO PUT THIS NEW SYSTEM INTO PRACTICAL USE PROMPTLY AND RECEIVING APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSES FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY EDISON SELECTED BROCKTON MASSACHUSETTS AND SUNBURY PENNSYLVANIA AS THE TWO TOWNS FOR THE TRIAL
WHILE THE LITTLE DYNAMO WAS BEING BUILT ALL THE MEN IN THE LABORATORY WROTE THEIR NAMES ON THE PAPER INSULATION THAT WAS WOUND UPON THE IRON CORE OF THE ARMATURE
IT IS A FACT HOWEVER THAT THE PRINCIPAL IMPROVEMENTS HE MADE IN DYNAMO-ELECTRIC GENERATORS WERE OF A RADICAL NATURE AND REMAIN IN THE ART

ANOTHER NIGHT HE CAME IN AND GOT FROM SOME PART OF THE BUILDING A LOT OF STATIONERY WITH CONFEDERATE STATES PRINTED AT THE HEAD

MUCH COULD BE ADDED TO MAKE A COMPLETE PICTORIAL DESCRIPTION OF THE HISTORIC PEARL STREET STATION BUT IT IS NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS NARRATIVE TO ENTER INTO DIFFUSE TECHNICAL DETAILS INTERESTING AS THEY MAY BE TO MANY PERSONS
YET WE CAN WELL APPRECIATE THE UNIMPRESSIONABLE WAY IN WHICH SOME OF THE MEN DID THEIR WORK FROM AN ANECDOTE THAT MR EDISON TELLS OF THAT AWFUL NIGHT OF FRIDAY APRIL 14 1865

IT WILL BE AT ONCE APPRECIATED THAT INASMUCH AS THE MAINS REQUIRED TO BE LAID ONLY ALONG THE BLOCKS TO BE LIGHTED AND WERE NOT REQUIRED TO BE RUN ALL THE WAY TO THE CENTRAL STATION WHICH MIGHT BE HALF A MILE OR MORE AWAY THE SAVING OF COPPER BY EDISON'S FEEDER SYSTEM WAS ENORMOUS
SUCH A RECORD OR PHONOGRAM AS IT WAS THEN CALLED COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE MACHINE OR REPLACED AT ANY TIME MANY REPRODUCTIONS COULD BE OBTAINED WITHOUT WEARING OUT THE RECORD AND WHENEVER DESIRED THE RECORD COULD BE SHAVED OFF BY A TURNING-TOOL SO AS TO PRESENT A FRESH SURFACE ON WHICH A NEW RECORD COULD BE FORMED SOMETHING LIKE AN ANCIENT PALIMPSEST

I DID A LOT OF WORK FOR THIS COMPANY MAKING AUTOMATIC APPARATUS IN MY SHOP AT NEWARK
HENCE IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR HIM TO ESTABLISH HIS OWN CHEMICAL WORKS AND PUT THEM IN CHARGE OF MEN SPECIALLY TRAINED BY HIMSELF WITH WHOM HE WORKED
THIS BUSINESS WAS ALSO SUBSEQUENTLY ABSORBED BY THE GOLD STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY WHICH WAS PROBABLY AT THIS TIME AT THE HEIGHT OF ITS PROSPERITY
EDISON CAN THINK OF MORE WAYS OF DOING A THING THAN ANY MAN I EVER SAW OR HEARD OF
THIS PLAN HAS BEEN ADHERED TO THROUGHOUT AND HAS FOUND ITS CONSUMMATION IN THE PRESENT FORM OF THE COMPLETED COMMERCIAL CELL BUT IN THE MIDDLE GROUND WHICH STANDS BETWEEN THE EARLY CRUDE BEGINNINGS AND THE PERFECTED TYPE OF TO-DAY THERE LIES A WORLD OF ORIGINAL THOUGHT PATIENT PLODDING AND ACHIEVEMENT
THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE INSTRUMENT AS A COMMERCIAL APPARATUS WERE RECOGNIZED FROM THE VERY FIRST AND SOME OF THE FIELDS IN WHICH IT WAS PREDICTED THAT THE PHONOGRAPH WOULD BE USED ARE NOW FULLY OCCUPIED
THE OBJECT OF THE PRESENT NARRATIVE AND THE SPACE AT THE AUTHORS DISPOSAL HOWEVER DO NOT PERMIT OF MORE THAN A BRIEF MENTION OF HIS EXPERIENCES
CURRENT WAS SUPPLIED TO THE ROAD BY UNDERGROUND FEEDER CABLES FROM THE DYNAMO-ROOM OF THE LABORATORY
BUT EVEN THUS EARLY THE STRONGER LOVE OF MECHANICAL PROCESSES AND OF PROBING NATURAL FORCES MANIFESTED ITSELF
THE HURON RIVER EMPTYING INTO LAKE ERIE WAS NAVIGABLE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THE VILLAGE AND PROVIDED AN ADMIRABLE OUTLET
THE COIL OF COARSE WIRE WAS IN SERIES WITH THE ARMATURE JUST AS THE RESISTANCE-BOXES HAD BEEN AND COULD BE PLUGGED IN OR OUT OF CIRCUIT AT THE WILL OF THE LOCOMOTIVE DRIVER
TURRETTINI BIEDERMANN AND THURY ALL DISTINGUISHED ENGINEERS TO NEGOTIATE FOR RIGHTS IN THE REPUBLIC
HE COLLECTED A LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENTLY SENT TO ORANGE FOR EDISON'S EXAMINATION
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE RIGID RESTING-PLACES FOR THE NUMEROUS AND ELABORATE INSTRUMENTS HE HAD PURCHASED FOR THIS PURPOSE THE BUILDING WAS EQUIPPED ALONG THREE-QUARTERS OF ITS LENGTH WITH SOLID PILLARS OR TABLES OF BRICK SET DEEP IN THE EARTH
THE MOMENT MY FAMILY GOT IN THE ROOM WITH THE FRENCH LADY'S MAID AND THE REST THEY COMMENCED TO GET SICK SO I FELT PRETTY SURE I WAS IN FOR IT
THAT HE IS NOT IS DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF CERTAIN QUALITIES THE LACK OF WHICH EDISON IS HIMSELF THE FIRST TO ADMIT
BUT ALL THE OLD LANGUAGES ARE DEAD AND THE LITERARY FORM IS THEIR EMBALMMENT
BUT EACH EVENING WHEN THE BOY WENT HOME WITH A BUNDLE OF PAPERS THAT HAD NOT BEEN SOLD IN THE TOWN HIS FATHER WOULD SIT UP READING THE RETURNABLES EDISON THEREFORE ON SOME EXCUSE LEFT THE PAPERS WITH HIS FRIEND BUT SUGGESTED THAT HE COULD GET THE NEWS FROM HIM BY TELEGRAPH BIT BY BIT

RECENTLY A DAILY REPORT OF ONE OF HIS COMPANIES THAT HAD JUST BEEN STARTED CONTAINED A LARGE ORDER AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WAS RETURNED BY HIM WITH A MINIATURE SKETCH OF A SMALL INDIVIDUAL VIEWING THAT PARTICULAR ITEM THROUGH A TELESCOPE
EARLY IN 1881 IT WAS COMPLETED AND TESTED BUT SOME RADICAL DEFECTS IN ARMATURE CONSTRUCTION WERE DEVELOPED AND IT WAS ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT A RATE OF ENGINE SPEED TOO HIGH FOR CONTINUOUSLY SAFE AND ECONOMICAL OPERATION HAD BEEN CHOSEN
HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MAGNETS WAS TREMENDOUS
AND I FOUND MYSELF LAUNCHED WITHOUT FURTHER CEREMONY INTO EDISON'S BUSINESS AFFAIRS

WHEN GOULD GOT THE WESTERN UNION I KNEW NO FURTHER PROGRESS IN TELEGRAPHY WAS POSSIBLE AND I WENT INTO OTHER LINES THE TRUTH IS THAT GENERAL ECKERT WAS A CONSERVATIVE--EVEN A REACTIONARY--AND BEING PREJUDICED LIKE MANY OTHER AMERICAN TELEGRAPH MANAGERS AGAINST MACHINE TELEGRAPHY THREW OUT ALL SUCH IMPROVEMENTS

WHEN AT 65 I USED TO HAVE IN MY DESK A BOX OF CIGARS
FROM OUR PREVIOUS ILLUSTRATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS IT WILL BE READILY SEEN THAT WITH THE TRANSMITTER CLOSED AT STATION A CURRENT FLOWS VIA POST P THROUGH S AND TO BOTH RELAY COILS AT A THENCE OVER THE MAIN LINE TO MAIN-LINE COIL AT B AND DOWN TO EARTH THROUGH S AND THE ARMATURE LEVER WITH ITS GROUNDED WIRE
AND STARTED TO SINK SHAFTS FIFTY FEET DEEP ALL OVER THE AREA
IT SEEMS THAT THE PEOPLE THERE HAD HAD A FALLING OUT AMONG THEMSELVES AND ONE OF THE DIRECTORS HAD STARTED OPPOSITION WORKS
THE FACTS OF THIS ACTUAL TEST ARE FAR MORE ELOQUENT THAN VOLUMES OF ARGUMENT WOULD BE AS A JUSTIFICATION OF EDISON'S ASSIDUOUS LABORS FOR OVER EIGHT YEARS AND OF THE EXPENDITURE OF A FORTUNE IN BRINGING HIS BROAD CONCEPTION TO A CONCRETE POSSIBILITY
HIS HEAD WAS COVERED COMPLETELY WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF VERY WHITE HAIR AND HE CHEWED TOBACCO INCESSANTLY NODDING TO FRIENDS AS THEY PASSED BY
COME RIGHT UP AND LOOK THEM OVER HE SENT HIS MAN UP AND FOUND WE HAD THE ORDERS AND WERE ALL RIGHT ALTHOUGH WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY

THE QUESTION BEFORE US IS TO WHAT EXTENT HAS EDISON ADDED TO THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD BY HIS INVENTIONS AND HIS ENERGY AND PERSEVERANCE
BUT THE IMMEDIATE MEASURES OF REPRESSION ENFORCED BEFORE A LIBERAL POLICY WAS ADOPTED WERE SHARP AND SEVERE AND SAMUEL EDISON ALSO FOUND HIS OWN CAREER MARRED ON CANADIAN SOIL AS ONE RESULT OF THE DURHAM ADMINISTRATION

AND BY THE END OF 1882 IT IS SEEN THAT NO FEWER THAN 153 ISOLATED EDISON PLANTS HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE WITH A CAPACITY OF 29,192 LAMPS
BESIDES THIS LAMP POSSESSED THE CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH RESISTANCE AND SMALL RADIATING SURFACE PERMITTING ECONOMY IN THE OUTLAY FOR CONDUCTORS AND REQUIRING ONLY A SMALL CURRENT FOR EACH UNIT OF LIGHT--CONDITIONS THAT WERE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY OF FULFILMENT IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH COMMERCIALLY THE SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC-LIGHT CURRENT

IN CONVERSATION EDISON IS DIRECT COURTEOUS READY TO DISCUSS A TOPIC WITH ANYBODY WORTH TALKING TO AND IN SPITE OF HIS SORE DEAFNESS AN EXCELLENT LISTENER
AS THE FREEZING OF THE ZINC SULPHATE SOLUTION IN COLD WEATHER WOULD CHECK ITS OPERATION EDISON INTRODUCED FOR EXAMPLE INTO THE METER AN INCANDESCENT LAMP AND A THERMOSTAT SO ARRANGED THAT WHEN THE TEMPERATURE FELL TO A CERTAIN POINT OR ROSE ABOVE ANOTHER POINT IT WAS CUT IN OR OUT
IT IS TRUE THAT IN AN ELECTRIC-LIGHTING SYSTEM THERE IS ALSO A FALL OR LOSS OF ELECTRICAL PRESSURE WHICH OCCURS IN OVERCOMING THE MUCH GREATER RESISTANCE OF THE FILAMENT IN AN INCANDESCENT LAMP
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF EDISON'S METHOD OF INVENTING THAT WORK IN SEVERAL LINES HAS GONE FORWARD AT THE SAME TIME
MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION AS TO HIS ORIGINALITY AND ABILITY ON IMPORTANT PEOPLE AND BROUGHT OUT VALUABLE INVENTIONS

INDEED THE EARLIEST ENTRY OF THIS DISCOVERY IN THE LABORATORY NOTE-BOOK BORE THAT CAPTION

WHILE THE ART OF ELECTROPLATING WOULD NATURALLY SUGGEST ITSELF AS THE MEANS OF MAKING SUCH A MOLD AN APPARENTLY INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE APPEARED ON THE VERY THRESHOLD

WHY DID HE NOT PRODUCE THIS LAMP IN HIS INTERVIEWS WITH BOHM OF THE AMERICAN COMPANY OR MOSES OF THE EDISON COMPANY WHEN IT WAS FOR HIS INTEREST TO DO SO
THUS THE FEEDERS COULD BE MADE COMPARATIVELY SMALL IN CROSS-SECTION
OF COURSE I ORDERED AN INVESTIGATION AND FOUND THAT THE PATENT SOLICITOR HAD DRAWN FROM THE COMPANY THE FEES FOR FILING ALL THESE APPLICATIONS BUT HAD NEVER FILED THEM
CHEAP TELEGRAPHY BEING THE SLOGAN OF THE TIME EDISON BECAME ARDUOUSLY INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT AND AT THE END OF THREE YEARS OF HARD WORK PRODUCED AN ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL SYSTEM A PUBLIC TEST OF WHICH WAS MADE ON DECEMBER 11 1873 WHEN ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND 12,000 WORDS WERE TRANSMITTED OVER A SINGLE WIRE FROM WASHINGTON TO NEW YORK
ONE DAY ON MAKING OUT A CUSTOMER'S BILL HIS CONFIDENCE RECEIVED A SEVERE SHOCK FOR THE METER READING SHOWED A CONSUMPTION CALLING FOR A CHARGE OF OVER $200 WHEREAS HE KNEW THAT THE LIGHT ACTUALLY USED SHOULD NOT COST MORE THAN ONE-QUARTER OF THAT AMOUNT
MR HERTER WAS DOING THE DECORATION AND IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY FINE
WHEN THE OCULIST FINISHED HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
THIS ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT BY THE DOUBLING OF POTENTIAL THE TWO OUTSIDE MAINS ARE REDUCED TO ONE-QUARTER THE CROSS-SECTION OTHERWISE NECESSARY
IT SEEMS I HAD RATHER A SOCIALISTIC STRAIN IN ME AND I RAISED THE PAY OF THE WORKMEN TWENTY-FIVE CENTS AN HOUR ABOVE THE PREVAILING RATE OF WAGES WHEREUPON HOE COMPANY OUR NEAR NEIGHBORS COMPLAINED AT OUR DOING THIS
I KNOW SEVERAL THOUSAND THINGS THAT WON'T WORK AT THAT TIME HE SENT ME OUT WEST ON A SPECIAL MISSION
INTERESTING AS THE NUMEROUS INVENTIONS ARE IT WOULD BE A WORK OF SUPEREROGATION TO DIGEST ALL THESE PATENTS IN THE PRESENT PAGES AS THEY REPRESENT NOT ONLY THE INCEPTION BUT ALSO THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF THE WAX-RECORD TYPE OF PHONOGRAPH FROM ITS INFANCY TO THE PRESENT PERFECTED MACHINE AND RECORDS NOW SO WIDELY KNOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD

SOME OF SUCH PATENTS MAY PROVE TO BE VALUABLE WHILE IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT IN THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS OTHERS WILL BE COMMERCIALLY WORTHLESS BUT NONE MAY BE ENTIRELY DISREGARDED IN THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ART
BUT FERRANTI HAD GOOD IDEAS AND HE WAS NO SMALL MAN INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED HERE THAT DURING THE SAME YEAR 1889 THE VARIOUS MANUFACTURING EDISON LIGHTING INTERESTS IN AMERICA WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF MR HENRY VILLARD AND CONSOLIDATED IN THE EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY WITH A CAPITAL OF NO LESS THAN $12,000,000 ON AN EIGHT-PER-CENT.-DIVIDEND BASIS

HIS OWN EXHIBIT MADE AT A PERSONAL EXPENSE OF OVER $100,000 COVERED SEVERAL THOUSAND SQUARE FEET IN THE VAST MACHINERY HALL AND WAS CENTRED AROUND A HUGE EDISON LAMP BUILT OF MYRIADS OF SMALLER LAMPS OF THE ORDINARY SIZE
EDISON WAS OF COURSE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE OPERATORS ALONG THE ROAD AND AT THE SOUTHERN TERMINAL AND TOOK UP HIS NEW DUTIES VERY EASILY
BUT THE COMING OF THE DYNAMO PLACED THAT ILLUMINANT ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS
AND THIS SYSTEM OF EDUCATION WAS NOTABLY IMPROVED BY A MANUAL WRITTEN BY MR EDISON HIMSELF
IT IS CALLED THE MIMEOGRAPH I ALSO INVENTED DEVICES FOR AND INTRODUCED PARAFFIN PAPER NOW USED UNIVERSALLY FOR WRAPPING UP CANDY ETC THE MIMEOGRAPH EMPLOYS A POINTED STYLUS USED AS IN WRITING WITH A LEAD-PENCIL WHICH IS MOVED OVER A KIND OF TOUGH PREPARED PAPER PLACED ON A FINELY GROOVED STEEL PLATE
SAMUEL EDISON ON MOVING TO PORT HURON BECAME A DEALER IN GRAIN AND FEED AND GAVE ATTENTION TO THAT BUSINESS FOR MANY YEARS
TOWARD THE END OF 1879 THE LABORATORY FORCE THUS NUMBERED AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED EARNEST MEN
THE ADOPTION OF THE BUSINESS PHONOGRAPH HAS NOT BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE UNANIMITY THAT OBTAINED IN THE CASE OF THE ONE USED MERELY FOR AMUSEMENT AS ITS USE INVOLVES SOME CHANGES IN METHODS THAT BUSINESS MEN ARE SLOW TO ADOPT UNTIL THEY REALIZE THE RESULTING CONVENIENCE AND ECONOMY
THE EDISON INVENTIONS WERE NOT ONLY A LAMP
AT THIS POINT I HAPPENED TO LOOK UP AND SAW THE OPERATORS ALL LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER WITH THEIR FACES SHINING WITH FUN AND EXCITEMENT
DURING THE SUMMERTIME AFTER WE HAD MADE SOMETHING WHICH WAS SUCCESSFUL I USED TO ENGAGE A BRICK-SLOOP AT PERTH AMBOY AND TAKE THE WHOLE CROWD DOWN TO THE FISHING-BANKS ON THE ATLANTIC FOR TWO DAYS
BUT OF THE OTHERS THERE ARE TWO DESERVING SPECIAL NOTICE--NAMELY THE ACCURACY OF MIXING AND THE FINENESS OF GRINDING
THE FLAKE OF NICKEL IS OBTAINED BY ELECTROPLATING UPON A METALLIC CYLINDER ALTERNATE LAYERS OF COPPER AND NICKEL ONE HUNDRED OF EACH AFTER WHICH THE COMBINED SHEET IS STRIPPED FROM THE CYLINDER
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CELLS PUT INTO THE HANDS OF THE PUBLIC UP TO DATE BEING APPROXIMATELY 1,500,000
I DIDN'T SEE A SINGLE EXCEPTION EXCEPT THE WAITERS AND MYSELF
EACH AND ALL THE LIGHTS MUST BE PRODUCED AND OPERATED WITH SUFFICIENT ECONOMY TO COMPETE ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS WITH GAS
BUT WOE BETIDE THE ONE WHO HAS COMMITTED AN ACT OF BAD FAITH TREACHERY DISHONESTY OR INGRATITUDE
AT THIS POINT EDISON WAS ASKED TO DIAGNOSE THE TROUBLE AND PROVIDE A REMEDY
THEY SAID
THEY SAID
BUT THEN CAME A SWIFT AND REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE IN THE ADOPTION OF GAS
IF ALL THESE LAMPS WERE ALWAYS LIGHTED BURNED AND EXTINGUISHED SIMULTANEOUSLY THE CENTRAL CONDUCTOR WOULD IN FACT REMAIN NEUTRAL AS THERE WOULD BE NO CURRENT PASSING THROUGH IT EXCEPT FROM LAMP TO LAMP
HE WAS TOLD TO DO SO IN FUTURE AND ANOTHER MONTH'S TEST WAS MADE
NOTHING IN THE EVIDENCE WARRANTS SUCH A SUPPOSITION AND OTHER THINGS SHOW IT TO BE UNTRUE
AND FOR THREE DAYS AFTER I COULD NOT GET RID OF HIM
THE OIL FLOWS IN THROUGH THE UPPER PIPE AND AFTER LUBRICATING THE SHAFT FLOWS OUT THROUGH THE LOWER PIPE BACK TO THE PUMPING STATION WHERE ANY DIRT IS FILTERED OUT AND THE OIL RETURNED TO CIRCULATION
THE CAR TOOK FIRE AND THE BOY IN DISMAY WAS STILL TRYING TO QUENCH THE BLAZE WHEN THE CONDUCTOR A QUICK-TEMPERED SCOTCHMAN WHO ACTED ALSO AS BAGGAGE-MASTER HASTENED TO THE SCENE WITH WATER AND SAVED HIS CAR
BUT I HAD BEEN USED TO THIS STYLE OF TELEGRAPHY IN TAKING REPORT AND WAS NOT IN THE LEAST DISCOMFITED
WHAT OTHERS MAY HAVE DONE BEARING DIRECTLY OR COLLATERALLY ON THE SUBJECT IN PRINT IS CAREFULLY CONSIDERED AND SIFTED TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION
THE RESULT WAS THAT AT SMITH MCNELL'S HE DECIDED ON APPLE DUMPLINGS AND A CUP OF COFFEE THAN WHICH HE NEVER ATE ANYTHING MORE APPETIZING
THOMPSON
AGAIN HE THREW UP HIS STEADY WORK AND WITH A COUPLE OF SANGUINE YOUNG FRIENDS MADE HIS WAY TO NEW ORLEANS
AFTER LEAVING THE JUNCTION JUST OUTSIDE OF DETROIT I BROUGHT IN THE EVENING PAPERS
THIS CHANGE IN THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS DID NOT AT ALL AFFECT THE UGLY EXTERNAL APPEARANCE WHICH DID LITTLE TO SUGGEST THE STATELY AND ORNATE STATIONS SINCE PUT UP BY THE NEW YORK EDISON COMPANY THE LATEST OCCUPYING WHOLE CITY BLOCKS

ONE OF THE MILDEST MANNERED OF THE PARTY TOOK UMBRAGE AT THE PARSIMONY OF THE TREASURER AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN WHEREUPON THE OTHERS IN THE PARTY SET UPON THE ASSAILANT AND MAULED HIM SO BADLY THAT HE HAD TO SPEND THREE WEEKS IN HOSPITAL
HE HAD EVEN DETERMINED UPON BAMBOO AS THE BEST MATERIAL FOR FILAMENTS

IF THE DIRECTION OF FLOW OF CURRENT BE REVERSED BY REVERSING THE BATTERY THE ELECTROMAGNETIC POLARITY ALSO REVERSES AND THE END OF THE PERMANENT MAGNET SWINGS OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE

IF HOWEVER THE TRANSMITTER IS OPERATED AT THE SAME END THE ENTIRE BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO THE MAIN LINE AND THE STRENGTH OF THIS CURRENT IS SUFFICIENT TO OPERATE THE NEUTRAL RELAY

THIS FIRST PATENT WAS TAKEN OUT FOR HIM BY THE LATE HON
UNTIL RELIEVED BY THE DAY OPERATOR SHALL SEND IN THE SIGNAL 6 TO THE TRAIN DISPATCHER'S OFFICE
SEVERAL OF THESE BEING FOR DUPLEX METHODS ON WHICH HE HAD EXPERIMENTED
A BREEZE CAME UP THE SEA BECAME ROUGH AND A LARGE NUMBER OF THE MEN WERE SICK
DAY AND NIGHT HE ACTUALLY WORKED IN THE TRENCHES WITH THE LABORERS AMID THE DIRT AND PAVING-STONES AND HURRY-BURLY OF TRAFFIC HELPING TO LAY THE TUBES FILLING UP JUNCTION-BOXES AND TAKING PART IN ALL THE INFINITE DETAIL
BUT EDISON SOON REALIZED THAT THIS TERRITORY WAS TOO EXTENSIVE FOR THE INITIAL EXPERIMENT AND HE DECIDED FINALLY UPON THE DISTRICT INCLUDED BETWEEN WALL NASSAU SPRUCE AND FERRY STREETS PECK SLIP AND THE EAST RIVER AN AREA NEARLY A SQUARE MILE IN EXTENT
ITS ESSENTIAL USE AS THEN CONTEMPLATED WAS AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR STENOGRAPHERS AND THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT FANCIES WERE INDULGED IN AS TO UTILITY IN THAT FIELD
THE FIRST THING THE ASTRONOMERS DID WAS TO DETERMINE WITH PRECISION THEIR EXACT LOCALITY UPON THE EARTH
3 REFERENCE LETTERS BEING THE SAME AS IN FIG
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE INDUSTRY WAS THEN IN AN IMMATURE STATE AND THAT THE GREAT BOOM DID NOT SET IN UNTIL A FEW YEARS AFTERWARD TWELVE OF THESE PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN FULLY VERIFIED BY THE ENORMOUS GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN ALL BRANCHES OF THE ART
THIS LATTER EVENT HAPPENED A NUMBER OF TIMES AND PROVED TO BE SUCH A SERIOUS ANNOYANCE THAT RESISTANCE-BOXES WERE BROUGHT OUT FROM THE LABORATORY AND PLACED UPON THE LOCOMOTIVE IN SERIES WITH THE ARMATURE
HE INSISTED I SHOULD GO--THAT A SPECIAL CAR WOULD LEAVE NEW YORK
DUPLEX TELEGRAPHY OR THE SENDING OF TWO SEPARATE MESSAGES IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME OVER ONE LINE WAS KNOWN AND PRACTICED PREVIOUS TO THIS TIME BUT QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPHY OR THE SIMULTANEOUS SENDING OF FOUR SEPARATE MESSAGES TWO IN EACH DIRECTION OVER A SINGLE LINE HAD NOT BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MANY AN INVENTOR'S DREAM AND THE OBJECT OF ANXIOUS EFFORTS FOR MANY LONG YEARS
THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE ON THIS MOTION IS IN THE DIRECTION THAT HE MADE THESE LAMP OR LAMPS SIMILAR IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THOUGH IT IS MANIFEST THAT FEW IF ANY OF THE MANY WITNESSES WHO SAW THE GOEBEL LAMP COULD FORM AN ACCURATE JUDGMENT OF THE SIZE OF THE FILAMENT OR BURNER
AT THE TIME A MEASURE WAS BEFORE THE VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE IN 1890 TO LIMIT THE PERMISSIBLE PRESSURES OF CURRENT SO AS TO RENDER IT SAFE HE SAID
14 1883 435,688 PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING ELECTRICITY
I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF AN EXPLOSION IN A MANHOLE WHERE THIS CHLOROFORM HAD BEEN USED
THE FIGURES OF CAPITALIZATION AND PROFIT JUST MENTIONED WERE RELATIVELY MUCH LARGER IN THE SIXTIES THAN THEY ARE TO-DAY
HE PROMPTLY SAID HE WOULD GIVE ME $100,000
THEY WERE FIXED UP AND HE WENT OVER TO NEW YORK AND SOLD THEM ALL
A IS A VIBRATOR B C D E ARE SHEETS OF TIN-FOIL HUNG ON INSULATING STANDS
HE SAID IT DID HIM MORE GOOD THAN BEING IN A SOFT BED WHICH SPOILS A MAN
AND IF EVER EDISON WAS SOMEWHAT DISMAYED
A REMARK OF EDISON FAMILIAR TO ALL WHO HAVE WORKED WITH HIM WHEN IT IS REPORTED TO HIM THAT SOMETHING NEW GOES ALL RIGHT AND IS SATISFACTORY FROM ALL POINTS OF VIEW IS
ONE OF THE VERY FIRST NOTES TELLS THE WHOLE STORY
BY MEANS OF THIS INSTRUMENT PRESSURES THAT ARE OTHERWISE INAPPRECIABLE AND UNDISCOVERABLE MAY BE OBSERVED AND INDICATED

APRIL 23 1873 147,917 DUPLEX TELEGRAPHS
WHAT THE EXPLANATION OF THIS GIFT POWER OR INTUITION MAY BE IS PERHAPS BETTER LEFT TO THE PSYCHOLOGIST TO SPECULATE UPON
HE FELL DOWN A HATCHWAY AND BROKE HIS ARM
THE WORLD WAS RANSACKED FOR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE CLAIMED AS AN ANTICIPATION OF WHAT HE HAD DONE
BESIDES BEING AFFECTED BY HEAT THIS DEVICE IS EXCEEDINGLY SENSITIVE TO MOISTURE

THERE THE FAMOUS PHILOSOPHER SHOWED AND EXPLAINED IT TO ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL WHEN THAT YOUNG AND PERSEVERING SCOTCH GENIUS WENT TO GET HELP AND DATA AS TO HARMONIC TELEGRAPHY UPON WHICH HE WAS WORKING AND AS TO TRANSMITTING VOCAL SOUNDS
AND ALTHOUGH THE EDISON INTERESTS HAD SPENT FROM FIRST TO LAST NEARLY $2,000,000 AND HAD ONLY ABOUT THREE YEARS LEFT IN THE LIFE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PATENT EDISON WAS THOROUGHLY SUSTAINED AS TO PRIORITY BY THE DECISIONS IN THE VARIOUS SUITS
HE SAID GO AHEAD I TELEGRAPHED TO THE MAN IN LIVERPOOL
PRIMITIVE BUT ESSENTIALLY SUCCESSFUL THIS LITTLE ROAD MADE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION ON THE MINDS OF MANY INVENTORS AND ENGINEERS AND MARKED THE REAL BEGINNING OF THE GREAT NEW ERA WHICH HAS ALREADY SEEN ELECTRICITY APPLIED TO THE OPERATION OF MAIN LINES OF TRUNK RAILWAYS
WE STARTED OUT OF THE LITTLE INLET AND GOT INTO THE CHANNEL AND THAT BOAT WENT IN SEVENTEEN DIRECTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY

FIRST OF ALL AS TO INVENTIONS CAPABLE OF FAIRLY DEFINITE ESTIMATE LET US MENTION THE INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHT AND SYSTEMS OF DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRIC LIGHT HEAT AND POWER WHICH MAY JUSTLY BE CONSIDERED AS THE CROWNING INVENTIONS OF EDISON'S LIFE
THERE WERE NO WIRES UNDERGROUND
I GAVE HIM A BIG DOSE OF GIN AND THIS REVIVED HIM

FINALLY I TELEGRAPHED KING TO FIND OUT IF HE HAD ANY SUGGESTIONS HIMSELF
IN NEW YORK THE TWO GREAT STOCK EXCHANGES HAVE DEEMED IT NECESSARY TO OWN AND OPERATE A STOCK-TICKER SERVICE FOR THE SOLE BENEFIT OF THEIR MEMBERS
ONE INSTANCE WILL SERVE AS AN ILLUSTRATION
INDEED THE DIRECT SUPERINTENDENCE SOON BECAME UNNECESSARY OWING TO THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE AND GREATER SKILL ACQUIRED BY THE INSTALLING STAFF
SOME OF THEM DID NOT COME WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS
ON ANOTHER OCCASION HE ENCOUNTERED A MORE NOVEL PERIL BY FALLING INTO THE PILE OF WHEAT IN A GRAIN ELEVATOR AND BEING ALMOST SMOTHERED
AND WHEN I TOOK OCCASION TO MENTION TO MY CHIEF THAT ON THE SUBJECT OF LIFE INSURANCE UNDERWRITERS REFUSE TO TAKE ANY RISKS ON AN ENTERPRISE SO HAZARDOUS MR EDISON SAID THAT IF I DID NOT PLACE TOO HIGH A VALUATION ON MY PERSON HE WOULD TAKE THE RISK HIMSELF
JULY 31 1880 264,642 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSLATION SYSTEM AUG
FONTAINE IN HIS BOOK ON ELECTRIC LIGHTING 1877 SHOWED THAT WITH THE CURRENT OF A BATTERY COMPOSED OF SIXTEEN ELEMENTS ONE LAMP GAVE AN ILLUMINATION EQUAL TO 54 BURNERS
NOR SHALL WE ATTEMPT TO OFFER ANY STATISTICS REGARDING EDISON'S NUMEROUS INVENTIONS RELATING TO TELEGRAPHS AND KINDRED DEVICES SUCH AS STOCK TICKERS RELAYS MAGNETS RHEOTOMES REPEATERS PRINTING TELEGRAPHS MESSENGER CALLS ETC ON WHICH HE WAS SO BUSILY OCCUPIED AS AN INVENTOR AND MANUFACTURER DURING THE TEN YEARS THAT BEGAN WITH JANUARY 1869
18 1907 939,817 CEMENT KILN
BOTH HE AND ONE OF HIS SONS WERE EMPLOYED IN 1881 BY THE AMERICAN COMPANY
FOLLOWING THE INCANDESCENT LAMP WE MUST NOT FORGET AN INDUSTRY EXCLUSIVELY ARISING FROM IT AND ABSOLUTELY DEPENDENT UPON IT--NAMELY THAT OF MAKING FIXTURES FOR SUCH LAMPS THE MANUFACTURE OF WHICH GIVES EMPLOYMENT TO UPWARD OF 6000 PERSONS WHO ANNUALLY RECEIVE AT LEAST $3,750,000 IN COMPENSATION
GOULD STARTED IN AT ONCE AND ASKED ME HOW MUCH I WANTED
NEVERTHELESS HE ACCEPTED THE PRINCIPLE AS VALUABLE AND PUT THE BATTERY TO ACTUAL USE
FROM THE OUTSET AN INNATE RECOGNITION OF SYSTEM DICTATED THE DESIRABILITY AND WISDOM OF PRESERVING RECORDS OF HIS EXPERIMENTS AND INVENTIONS
THE AMAZING THING ABOUT IT ALL IS THAT THIS FLOOD OF MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS FLOWS ON IN ONE STEADY UNINTERRUPTED STREAM YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT
LET ME SUGGEST THAT IF INVESTIGATOR REALLY WISHES TO INVESTIGATE AND IS COMPETENT AND WILLING TO LEARN THE EXACT FACTS HE CAN DO SO AT THIS OFFICE WHERE THERE IS NO MYSTERY OF CONCEALMENT BUT ON THE CONTRARY A STRONG DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE FACTS TO INTELLIGENT INQUIRERS
IT WAS HE WHO ERECTED AT ATHENS THE FIRST EUROPEAN EDISON STATION ON THE NOW UNIVERSAL THREE-WIRE SYSTEM
THESE SUGGESTIONS OF YOUNG STARR WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY OTHER EXPERIMENTERS WHOSE IMPROVEMENTS CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY IN DEVICES TO INCREASE THE COMPACTNESS AND PORTABILITY OF THE LAMP IN THE SEALING OF THE LAMP CHAMBER TO PREVENT THE ADMISSION OF AIR AND IN MEANS FOR RENEWING THE CARBON BURNER WHEN IT HAD BEEN CONSUMED
GEORGE KENNAN HAS ACHIEVED FAME IN LITERATURE AND GUY CARLETON AND HARRY DE SOUCHET HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AS DRAMATISTS
MR C
NOR DID HE MERELY STAND AROUND AND GIVE ORDERS
THIS HAD PUZZLED ME FOR YEARS BUT ONE DAY I WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LET INTO PART OF THE SECRET
THEY CAME TO MENLO PARK ON A LATE AFTERNOON TRAIN FROM NEW YORK
TO BRING ABOUT THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF A PROJECT SO EXTRAORDINARILY BROAD INVOLVES ENGINEERING AND MECHANICAL CONCEPTIONS OF A HIGH ORDER AND AS WE HAVE SEEN THESE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE SUBJECT BY EDISON TOGETHER WITH AN INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF COMPOUNDED MATERIALS
WHEN HIS PRESENT LABORATORY WAS NEARING COMPLETION IN 1887 HE WROTE TO MR J
THUS THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF EDISON'S PATENTS ON ELECTRIC LIGHT POWER AND DISTRIBUTION THE INTERMINABLE LEGAL STRIFE HAS CONTINUED FROM DAY TO DAY FROM YEAR TO YEAR
WHILE THERE THE MANAGER OF THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE WAS ARRESTED FOR SOMETHING I NEVER UNDERSTOOD AND INCARCERATED IN A MILITARY PRISON ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE OFFICE
THEN THE TELEPHONE COMPANY GAVE ME A DINNER AND THE ENGINEERS OF FRANCE
A LESS FREQUENT VISITOR WAS MR S
NONE OF THE WRITERS SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS DONE
FOOTNOTE 6
IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE CENTURY THESE METHODS WERE BROUGHT TO PRACTICALITY BUT ALL MAY BE REFERRED BACK TO THE BRILLIANT DEMONSTRATIONS OF SIR HUMPHRY DAVY AT THE ROYAL INSTITUTION CIRCA 1809-10 WHEN WITH THE CURRENT FROM A BATTERY OF TWO THOUSAND CELLS HE PRODUCED AN INTENSE VOLTAIC ARC BETWEEN THE POINTS OF CONSUMING STICKS OF CHARCOAL
THIS IS KNOWN AS THE FEEDER AND MAIN SYSTEM FOR WHICH HE SIGNED THE APPLICATION FOR A PATENT ON AUGUST 4 1880
EACH MACHINE MADE THESE BRIQUETTES AT THE RATE OF SIXTY PER MINUTE AND DROPPED THEM INTO BUCKET CONVEYORS BY WHICH THEY WERE CARRIED INTO DRYING FURNACES THROUGH WHICH THEY MADE FIVE LOOPS AND WERE THEN DELIVERED TO CROSS-CONVEYORS WHICH CARRIED THEM INTO THE STOCK-HOUSE
WE HAVE ENJOYED THIS VISIT VERY MUCH BUT THERE IS ONE QUESTION WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK
POPE

WHEN IT WAS REPORTED THAT HOOD WAS MARCHING ON NASHVILLE ONE NIGHT A JEW CAME INTO THE OFFICE ABOUT 11 O'CLOCK IN GREAT EXCITEMENT HAVING HEARD THE HOOD RUMOR
IN 1876 OR 1877 BOULIGUINE PROPOSED THE EMPLOYMENT OF A LONG CARBON PENCIL A SHORT SECTION ONLY OF WHICH WAS IN CIRCUIT AT ANY ONE TIME AND FORMED THE BURNER THE LAMP BEING PROVIDED WITH A MECHANISM FOR AUTOMATICALLY PUSHING OTHER SECTIONS OF THE PENCIL INTO POSITION BETWEEN THE CONTACTS TO RENEW THE BURNER
IT IS A POPULAR IDEA FOUNDED ON EXPERIENCE THAT AN INVENTOR IS NOT USUALLY A BUSINESS MAN
HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN WAGONS DRAWN BY OXEN TO THE REMOTE AND PRIMITIVE TOWNSHIP OF BAYFIELD IN UPPER CANADA ON LAKE HURON
EDISON EXPLAINED THAT BEING DEAF HE HAD HEARD NO CHALLENGE AND THEREFORE HAD KEPT MOVING
WE HAVE THEREFORE CONFINED OURSELVES TO THE INDICATION OF A FEW SALIENT AND BASIC FEATURES LEAVING IT TO THE INTERESTED STUDENT TO EXAMINE THE PATENTS AND THE TECHNICAL LITERATURE OF THE LONG PERIOD OF TIME OVER WHICH EDISON'S LABORS WERE EXTENDED

AND IF THE X-RAY ELECTRODES WERE LET INTO THE GLASS CHAMBER AND A PROPER VACUUM WAS ATTAINED YOU COULD GET A FLUORESCENT LAMP OF SEVERAL CANDLE-POWER

WITH CHARACTERISTIC PERTINACITY MR LOWREY STOOD BY THE INVENTOR THROUGH THICK AND THIN IN SPITE OF DOUBT DISCOURAGEMENT AND RIDICULE UNTIL AT LAST SUCCESS CROWNED HIS EFFORTS
MEIN GOTT IM HIMMEL AND YET HE HAD ALREADY SEEN EDISON DO A FEW CLEVER THINGS
FOR THE CURIOUS-MINDED REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE RECORDS IN THE PATENT OFFICE WHICH WILL SHOW THAT UP TO 1893 EDISON HAD OBTAINED UPWARD OF SIXTY-FIVE PATENTS IN THIS ART FROM WHICH HIS LINE OF THOUGHT CAN BE VERY CLOSELY TRACED
THE FIRM OF BABCOCK WILCOX GAVE AID ON THE BOILERS ARMINGTON SIMS UNDERTOOK THE ENGINES BUT EVERYTHING ELSE WAS ABNORMAL
A TENDENCY EXISTED AT THE TIME TO ASSUME THAT ELECTRICITY WAS ALTOGETHER SAFE WHILE ITS OPPONENTS PREDICATING THEIR ATTACKS ON ARC-LIGHTING CASUALTIES INSISTED IT WAS MOST DANGEROUS
CLARKE OCT
THIS INSURES COMPLETE AND PERFECT CONTACT AND CONSEQUENT ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE UNIT
TRUE BUT AS ANY GOOD PORTLAND CEMENT CAN BE USED AND NO RESTRICTIONS AS TO SOURCE OF SUPPLY ARE ENFORCED HE OR RATHER HIS COMPANY WILL BE MERELY ONE OF MANY POSSIBLE PURVEYORS
HE WAS ABOUT THE MOST WILLING TUTOR AND I MUST CONFESS THAT HE HAD TO BE A PATIENT ONE HERE AGAIN OCCURS THE REFERENCE TO THE INCESSANT NIGHT-WORK AT MENLO PARK A NOTE THAT IS STRUCK IN EVERY REMINISCENCE AND IN EVERY RECORD OF THE TIME
IT WAS DURING THIS PERIOD OF INVENTING A SYSTEM THAT SO MUCH SYSTEMATIC AND CONTINUOUS WORK WITH GOOD RESULTS WAS DONE BY EDISON IN THE DESIGN AND PERFECTION OF DYNAMOS
BUT THEY ARE AT LEAST AN INDICATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE INTERESTS THE WORLD
THE RODS ALSO
IN SHORT HE WOULD AND DOES REGARD IT AS A FOOLISH WASTE OF HIS TIME TO GIVE ATTENTION TO THE MERE OCCUPANCY OF A DESK
THAT CAREER IS CERTAINLY WELL WORTH THE TELLING AS ANOTHER STORY TO USE THE KIPLING PHRASE
WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND THE GREAT PLANS FOR LIGHTING NEW YORK DEMANDED VERY CLOSE PERSONAL ATTENTION ON THE SPOT
SOMETIMES WHEN MR EDISON HAD BEEN WORKING LONG HOURS HE WOULD WANT TO HAVE A SHORT SLEEP
NONE OF THESE CIRCUITS CARRIED DANGEROUS CURRENTS
HERE TOO IS A SELECT LITTLE LIBRARY OF CHEMICAL LITERATURE
THE POURING OF THE ENTIRE HOUSE IS ACCOMPLISHED IN ABOUT SIX HOURS AND THEN THE MOLDS ARE LEFT UNDISTURBED FOR SIX DAYS IN ORDER THAT THE CONCRETE MAY SET AND HARDEN
IF IT WERE ATTEMPTED TO OFFER HERE A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE VARIED AND NUMEROUS OPERATIONS OF THE QUADRUPLEX THIS ARTICLE WOULD ASSUME THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREATISE
ONE MIGHT BE INCLINED TO DISMISS THIS TRIVIAL INCIDENT SMILINGLY AS A MERE CHILDISH THOUGHTLESS PRANK HAD NOT SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT AS A CHILD BOY AND MAN REVEALED A BORN INVESTIGATOR WITH ORIGINAL REASONING POWERS THAT DISDAINING CROOKS AND BENDS ALWAYS AIMED AT THE CENTRE AND LIKE THE FLIGHT OF THE BEE WERE ACCURATE AND DIRECT
ON THE KEYBOARD OF THE TRANSMITTER THERE ARE TWO CHARACTERS KNOWN AS DOTS"--NAMELY THE LETTER DOT AND THE FIGURE DOT
THE CURIOUS FACT THAT YOU NEEDED NO MATCHES TO LIGHT IT AND THAT IT WAS UNDER ABSOLUTE CONTROL FROM A DISTANCE--THESE AND MANY OTHER FEATURES CAME AS A DISTINCT REVELATION AND MARVEL WHILE PROMISING SO MUCH ADDITIONAL COMFORT CONVENIENCE AND BEAUTY IN THE HOME THAT INSPECTION WAS ALMOST INVARIABLY FOLLOWED BY A REQUEST FOR INSTALLATION
I DID NOT KNOW IT AT THE TIME BUT I HAD MADE BROMIDE OF NITROGEN
THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS GENERALLY SATISFACTORY BUT THE RESISTANCE-BOXES SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLATFORM AND FOOT-RESTS BEING IN THE WAY EDISON DIRECTED THAT SOME NO
2 OLFACTORY EVIDENCE PRESENTS ITSELF OF THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF A CHEMICAL LABORATORY
HE WAS NOT IN REGULAR ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL AND HAD READ ALL THE BOOKS WITHIN REACH
THE LONG LINE OF PATENTS SECURED BY HIM IN THIS ART IS AN INTERESTING EXHIBIT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GERM TO A COMPLETED SYSTEM NOT AS IS USUALLY THE CASE BY NUMEROUS INVENTORS WORKING OVER CONSIDERABLE PERIODS OF TIME BUT BY ONE MAN EVOLVING THE SUCCESSIVE STEPS AT A WHITE HEAT OF ACTIVITY
AND MANY WANT ADVICE AS TO WHAT THEY SHALL DO WITH THEIR SONS FREQUENTLY BUDDING GENIUSES WHOSE ABILITY TO WIRE A BELL HAS DEMONSTRATED UNUSUAL QUALITIES
DURING THE DAY HE SUCCEEDED IN LOCATING THIS OPERATOR BUT FOUND THAT HE ALSO WAS OUT OF A JOB AND THAT THE BEST HE COULD DO WAS TO LOAN HIM ONE DOLLAR WHICH HE DID
ANOTHER VIVID MEMORY OF THIS PERIOD CONCERNS HIS FIRST REALIZATION OF THE GRIM MYSTERY OF DEATH
IT WILL BE NOTICED HOWEVER THAT THESE RECORDS SHOW MUCH PROGRESSION IN A LITTLE OVER A MONTH

I NEVER DREAMED A MAN COULD HAVE SUCH PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE
IT HAD EVEN STRIPPED SOME OF THE THREADS OF THE BOLTS AND WE COULD NEVER FIND THAT COVER
WE PLACED LEGS ON AN INVERTED BEAKER AND HELD THE TWO ENDS OF THE WIRES ON GLASS RODS EIGHT INCHES LONG
WE ARE UP TO THE MUZZLE AND EVERYTHING IS RUNNING ALL RIGHT BY-AND-BY IT BECAME SO THICK WE COULD NOT SEE ACROSS THE STREET

ANY ONE WHO IS NOT DEAF AND DUMB MAY USE THIS MODE OF TRANSMISSION WHICH WOULD REQUIRE NO APPARATUS EXCEPT AN ELECTRIC BATTERY TWO VIBRATING DISKS AND A WIRE THIS WOULD SERVE ADMIRABLY FOR A PORTRAYAL OF THE BELL TELEPHONE EXCEPT THAT IT MENTIONS DISTINCTLY THE USE OF THE MAKE-AND-BREAK METHOD I
AS THE PAPER PASSED ALONG THE WHEELS DROPPED INTO THE PERFORATIONS MAKING MOMENTARY CONTACTS WITH THE DRUM BENEATH AND CAUSING MOMENTARY IMPULSES OF CURRENT TO BE TRANSMITTED OVER THE LINE IN THE SAME WAY THAT THEY WOULD BE PRODUCED BY THE MANIPULATION OF THE TELEGRAPH KEY BUT WITH MUCH GREATER RAPIDITY
COULDN'T THE WRITER OF THE ARTICLE SEE THAT SINCE C = E/(R + R THAT BY R/N OR BY MAKING R = R THE MACHINE WOULD ACCORDING TO HIS THEORY HAVE RETURNED MORE USEFUL CURRENT TO THE CIRCUIT THAN COULD BE DUE TO THE POWER EMPLOYED AND IN THE RATIO INDICATED SO THAT THERE WOULD ACTUALLY BE A CREATION OF FORCE
AFTER WE GOT OVER THE TRESTLE AND STARTED ON DOWN THE TRACK HENDERSON SAID
THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE MOVEMENTS OF A THREE-ARM ROCKING-LEVER ATTACHED TO THE WHEEL-SLEEVE AT THE END OF THE SHAFT
THE LOWEST ROLL WAS SET IN A FIXED BEARING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME AND THEREFORE COULD ONLY TURN AROUND ON ITS AXIS
AT HEIDELBERG MY ASSISTANT MR WANGEMANN AN ACCOMPLISHED GERMAN-AMERICAN SHOWED THE PHONOGRAPH BEFORE THE ASSOCIATION THEN CAME THE TRIP FROM THE CONTINENT TO ENGLAND OF WHICH THIS WILL CERTAINLY PASS AS A GRAPHIC PICTURE
THEN THERE ARE THE FACTORIES WHERE THESE INCANDESCENT LAMPS ARE MADE ABOUT FORTY IN NUMBER REPRESENTING A TOTAL INVESTMENT THAT MAY BE APPROXIMATED AT $25,000,000
AFTER A WHILE WHEN WE WERE READY TO RESUME WORK OUR VISITORS WOULD INTIMATE THAT THEY WERE GOING HOME TO BED BUT WE FELLOWS COULD STAY UP AND WORK AND THEY WOULD DEPART GENERALLY SINGING SOME SONG LIKE GOOD-NIGHT LADIES
BUT THE SENSATIONAL STEP WAS TAKEN ABOUT 1880 WHEN FAURE IN FRANCE AND BRUSH IN AMERICA BROKE AWAY FROM THE SLOW AND WEARY PROCESS OF FORMING THE PLATES AND HIT ON CLEVER METHODS OF FURNISHING THEM READY MADE SO TO SPEAK BY DABBING RED LEAD ONTO LEAD-GRID PLATES JUST AS BUTTER IS SPREAD ON A SLICE OF HOME-MADE BREAD

TELEPHONES SO OPERATED REPEATED SPEAKING AND SINGING IN VERY LOUD TONES
FROM WHATEVER POINT OF VIEW THE SUBJECT IS APPROACHED THE FACT REMAINS THAT IN THE MOTION PICTURE PERHAPS MORE THAN WITH ANY OTHER INVENTION EDISON HAS CREATED AN ART THAT MUST ALWAYS MAKE A SPECIAL APPEAL TO THE MIND AND EMOTIONS OF MEN AND ALTHOUGH SO FAR IT HAS NOT ADVANCED MUCH BEYOND THE FIELD OF AMUSEMENT IT CONTAINS ENORMOUS POSSIBILITIES FOR SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT IN THE FUTURE

THE REPLY WAS
SEPARATE THE RESIDUUM IN AS MANY DEFINITE PARTS AS POSSIBLE BOTTLE AND LABEL AND KEEP ACCURATE RECORDS AS TO PROCESS WEIGHTS ETC SO A REPRODUCTION OF THE EXPERIMENT CAN AT ANY TIME BE MADE

IN ORDER TO COMPREHEND THE MAGNITUDE AND EXTENT OF HIS WORK AND THE QUALITY OF HIS GENIUS IT IS NECESSARY TO EXAMINE MINUTELY THE LIST OF PATENTS ISSUED FOR THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS WHICH GO TO MAKE UP SUCH A SYSTEM
ON ONE OCCASION HOWEVER WHEN EVERYTHING POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE UNDER THE SUN WAS BEING CARBONIZED FOR LAMP FILAMENTS HE ALLOWED A HANDFUL OF HIS BUSHY RED BEARD TO BE TAKEN FOR THE PURPOSE

SOON TIRING OF IDLENESS AND ISOLATION HE SENT A CRY FROM MACEDONIA TO HIS OLD FRIEND MILT ADAMS WHO WAS IN BOSTON AND WHOM HE WISHED TO REJOIN IF HE COULD GET WORK PROMPTLY IN THE EAST
THE OTHER DIFFICULTY ABOVE REFERRED TO WAS ONE THAT HAD ALSO OCCUPIED CONSIDERABLE THOUGHT AND ATTENTION OF MANY WORKERS IN THE FIELD AND RELATED TO THE PERFORATING OF THE DASH IN THE TRANSMISSION TAPE
GILLILAND OF BOSTON HAD BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH HIM IN HIS EXPERIMENTS AND THEY TOOK OUT SEVERAL JOINT PATENTS SUBSEQUENTLY
THIS ROOF COULD BE RAISED OR LOWERED AT WILL
A PRIVATE-LINE DEPARTMENT WAS ESTABLISHED AND THE BUSINESS TAKEN OVER FROM POPE EDISON AND ASHLEY WAS RAPIDLY ENLARGED AT THIS JUNCTURE GENERAL LEFFERTS AS PRESIDENT OF THE GOLD STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY REQUESTED EDISON TO GO TO WORK ON IMPROVING THE STOCK TICKER FURNISHING THE MONEY
NOT ONLY WAS IT NOW POSSIBLE TO CONVERT MECHANICAL ENERGY INTO ELECTRICITY CHEAPLY AND IN ILLIMITABLE QUANTITIES BUT ELECTRICITY AT ONCE SHOWED ITS UBIQUITOUS AVAILABILITY AS A MOTIVE POWER

A SPECIAL TYPE OF STREET POLE HAD BEEN DEVISED BY HIM FOR THE THREE-WIRE SYSTEM
I USED TO RUN HIS OFFICE ON AS CLOSE BUSINESS METHODS AS MY EXPERIENCE ADMITTED
HARD WORK BASED ON HARD THINKING THE LABORATORY RECORDS BEAR THE FULLEST WITNESS THAT HE HAS CONSISTENTLY FOLLOWED OUT THIS PRESCRIPTION TO THE UTMOST
BASING THEIR OPERATIONS ON THIS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND UPON THE TENDENCY OF HUMAN NATURE TO GIVE CREDENCE TO WIDELY ADVERTISED AND HIGH-SOUNDING DESCRIPTIONS AND SPECIOUS PROMISES OF VAST PROFITS THESE MEN FIND LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN CONJURING MONEY OUT OF THE POCKETS OF THE UNSOPHISTICATED AND GULLIBLE WHO RUSH TO BECOME STOCKHOLDERS IN CONCERNS THAT HAVE AIRY NOTHINGS FOR A FOUNDATION AND THAT COLLAPSE QUICKLY WHEN THE BUBBLE IS PRICKED
INDEED THE COMPARATIVE CALCULATION OF MR JENKS ABOVE REFERRED TO SHOWS THAT TO OPERATE THE SAME NUMBER OF LIGHTS IN THE SAME EXTENDED AREA OF TERRITORY THE FEEDER SYSTEM WOULD REQUIRE ONLY 128,739 POUNDS OF COPPER WHICH AT THE THEN PRICE OF 25 CENTS PER POUND WOULD COST ONLY $39,185 OR A SAVING OF $168,627.50 FOR COPPER IN THIS VERY SMALL DISTRICT OF ONLY NINE BLOCKS
THE WEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY INVESTED LARGELY IN THIS BUSINESS AND IN ALLIED TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES WAS ACCUMULATED RAPIDLY AND AS FREELY SPENT DURING THOSE DAYS OF PROSPERITY IN ST CLAIR COUNTY BRINGING WITH IT A HIGH STANDARD OF DOMESTIC COMFORT
HE IS NOT A RELIGIOUS MAN IN THE SENSE OF TURNING TO FORMS AND CREEDS BUT AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED IS INCLINED AS AN INVENTOR AND CREATOR TO ARGUE FROM THE BASIS OF DESIGN AND THENCE TO INFER A DESIGNER
I BELIEVE THAT IN COMING YEARS BY MY OWN WORK AND THAT OF DICKSON MUYBRIDGE MAREY AND OTHERS WHO WILL DOUBTLESS ENTER THE FIELD GRAND OPERA CAN BE GIVEN AT THE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE AT NEW YORK WITHOUT ANY MATERIAL CHANGE FROM THE ORIGINAL AND WITH ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS LONG SINCE DEAD IN THE EARLIEST EXPERIMENTS ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO SECURE THE PHOTOGRAPHS REDUCED MICROSCOPICALLY ARRANGED SPIRALLY ON A CYLINDER ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PHONOGRAPH RECORD AND COATED WITH A HIGHLY SENSITIZED SURFACE THE CYLINDER BEING GIVEN AN INTERMITTENT MOVEMENT SO AS TO BE AT REST DURING EACH EXPOSURE
HENCE IT WILL BE QUITE APPARENT THAT THE SLIGHTEST INEQUALITY IN THE SURFACE OF THE WAX WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE FALSE VIBRATION AND THUS GIVE RISE TO DISTORTED EFFECTS IN SUCH MUSIC OR OTHER SOUNDS AS WERE BEING REPRODUCED
THAT NIGHT I FOUND A FRENCH PASTRY SHOP IN HIGH HOLBORN STREET AND FILLED UP
STILL ANOTHER INSTANCE IS SEEN IN ONE OF EDISON'S CAVEATS WHERE HE DESCRIBES A METHOD OF DISTILLING LIQUIDS BY MEANS OF INTERNALLY APPLIED HEAT THROUGH ELECTRIC CONDUCTORS
THEN THEY WENT OUT AND THE PLACE WAS SOON CROWDED AND THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT
THE VALUE OF SUCH AN ANTICIPATION OF THE EDISON LAMP WAS MADE KNOWN TO HIM

MOST OF THEM WERE UTTERLY NOVEL AND UNKNOWN TO THE ARTS AND ALL OF THEM REQUIRED QUICK AND I MAY SAY REVOLUTIONARY THOUGHT AND INVENTION
IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT FROM THE VERY OUTSET EDISON HAD DISDAINED ANY INTENTION OF FOLLOWING IN THE ONLY TRACKS THEN KNOWN BY EMPLOYING LEAD AND SULPHURIC ACID AS THE COMPONENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL STORAGE BATTERY
THE GIRLS TITTERED AND THIS INCREASED HIS EMBARRASSMENT UNTIL HE COULDN'T SAY A WORD

THE TASK OF THE AUTHORS HAS CONSISTED LARGELY IN SUMMARIZING FAIRLY THE METHODS AND PROCESSES EMPLOYED BY EDISON
HIS NAME WAS EDISON AND HE HAD A SHOP OUT AT NEWARK NEW JERSEY
HE RAILED OVER IT
AT THE ROOT OF ALL SYSTEMS OF TELEGRAPHY INCLUDING MULTIPLEX SYSTEMS THERE LIES THE SINGLE BASIC PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH THEIR PERFORMANCE DEPENDS--NAMELY THE OBTAINING OF A SLIGHT MECHANICAL MOVEMENT AT THE MORE OR LESS DISTANT END OF A TELEGRAPH LINE

TO SECURE UNIFORMITY IN THE SEVERAL FEDERAL CIRCUITS AND CORRECT ERRORS IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH A CENTRAL COURT OF PATENT APPEALS IN WASHINGTON
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NICKEL FLAKE CONTAINS IN ITSELF A HISTORY OF PATIENT INVESTIGATION LABOR AND ACHIEVEMENT BUT WE HAVE NOT SPACE FOR IT NOR FOR TRACING THE GREAT WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN DEVELOPING AND PERFECTING THE NUMEROUS OTHER PARTS AND ADJUNCTS OF THIS REMARKABLE BATTERY
AND A CONSEQUENT DETERMINATION TO EARN SOME MONEY FOR HIMSELF LED TO HIS FIRST REAL COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE AS CANDY BUTCHER ON THE GRAND TRUNK RAILROAD ALREADY MENTIONED IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER
ALTHOUGH IT TOOK TWO OR THREE YEARS TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC OF THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS VIEWS THE IDEA GRADUALLY TOOK STRONG ROOT AND HAS NOW BECOME AN INTEGRAL PRINCIPLE OF THE BUSINESS
THE JUDGE NEVER DECIDED THE CASE BUT WENT CRAZY A FEW MONTHS AFTERWARD IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A CHARACTERISTICALLY SHREWD MOVE ON THE PART OF MR GOULD TO SECURE AN INTEREST IN THE QUADRUPLEX AS A FACTOR IN HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE WESTERN UNION AND AS A DECISIVE STEP TOWARD HIS CONTROL OF THAT SYSTEM BY THE SUBSEQUENT MERGER THAT INCLUDED NOT ONLY THE ATLANTIC PACIFIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY BUT THE AMERICAN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY

THE SITUATION WAS SO DESPERATE THAT FOR A REASON I NEVER COULD EXPLAIN I STARTED IN MYSELF AND TALKED AND EXPLAINED BETTER THAN I EVER DID BEFORE OR SINCE
THE EDISON UNISON COMPRISED A LEVER WITH A FREE END TRAVELLING IN A SPIRAL OR WORM ON THE TYPE-WHEEL SHAFT UNTIL IT MET A PIN AT THE END OF THE WORM THUS OBSTRUCTING THE SHAFT AND LEAVING THE TYPE-WHEELS AT THE ZERO-POINT UNTIL RELEASED BY THE PRINTING LEVER

A GOOD MANY INVENTORS TRY TO DEVELOP THINGS LIFE-SIZE AND THUS SPEND ALL THEIR MONEY INSTEAD OF FIRST EXPERIMENTING MORE FREELY ON A SMALL SCALE TO EDISON LIFE IS NOT ONLY A GRAND OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT THINGS BY EXPERIMENT BUT WHEN FOUND TO IMPROVE THEM BY FURTHER EXPERIMENT
SOMETIMES THE NICKEL WOULD BE AHEAD IN THE TESTS AND THEN AGAIN IT WOULD FALL BEHIND
IN THE FACE OF MUCH ADVERSE CRITICISM HE HAD DEVELOPED THE ESSENTIALS OF THE LOW-INTERNAL-RESISTANCE DYNAMO WITH HIGH-RESISTANCE FIELD AND MANY OF THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF MULTIPLE-ARC DISTRIBUTION AND IN 1880 HE BUILT A SMALL ROAD AT HIS LABORATORY AT MENLO PARK ON MAY 13TH OF THE YEAR NAMED THIS INTERESTING ROAD WENT INTO OPERATION AS THE RESULT OF HARD AND HURRIED WORK OF PREPARATION DURING THE SPRING MONTHS
THE RACKET THUS PRODUCED WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND THE SLEEPER WOULD JUMP UP AS THOUGH A TYPHOON HAD STRUCK THE LABORATORY
ONE CANNOT IMAGINE THE ART WITHOUT IT
A COMPLETE SET OF MOLDS WILL COST APPROXIMATELY $25,000 WHILE THE NECESSARY PLANT WILL COST ABOUT $15,000 MORE
IN THE MOTION-PICTURE ART INFRINGEMENTS BEGAN WITH ITS VERY BIRTH AND BEFORE THE INEVITABLE LITIGATION COULD BE TERMINATED NO LESS THAN TEN COMPETITORS WERE IN THE FIELD WITH WHOM COMPROMISES HAD TO BE MADE
ELECTRICIANS AND SCIENTISTS OF THE PERIOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED FOR MANY YEARS PAST TO LOOK TO THE CHEMICAL BATTERY AS THE SOURCE FROM WHICH TO OBTAIN ELECTRICAL ENERGY
HENCE IT BECAME NECESSARY TO INVENT A SYSTEM OF CONVEYORS THAT WOULD BE CAPABLE OF TRANSFERRING THIS MASS OF MATERIAL FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER
IN CONSEQUENCE THE LINE MAY BE HUNDREDS OF MILES IN LENGTH

HE HAD A LARGE WIDE-AWAKE HAT OF THE SOMBRERO PATTERN THEN GENERALLY USED IN THIS COUNTRY AND A ROUGH BROWN OVERCOAT CUT SOMEWHAT SIMILARLY TO HIS PRINCE ALBERT COAT

ONE DAY WHILE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE MERCURY PUMP MY ASSISTANT AN AWKWARD COUNTRY LAD FROM A FARM ON STATEN ISLAND WHO HAD ADENOIDS IN HIS NOSE AND BREATHED THROUGH HIS MOUTH WHICH WAS ALWAYS WIDE OPEN WAS LOOKING UP AT THIS PIPE AT A SMALL LEAK OF MERCURY WHEN THE RUBBER TUBE CAME OFF AND PROBABLY TWO POUNDS OF MERCURY WENT INTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT AND GOT THROUGH HIS SYSTEM SOMEHOW
WITH A GLASS ROD FOUR FEET LONG WELL RUBBED WITH A PIECE OF SILK OVER A HOT STOVE WITH A PIECE OF BATTERY CARBON SECURED TO ONE END WE RECEIVED VIVID SPARKS INTO THE CARBON WHEN THE OTHER END WAS HELD IN THE HAND WITH THE HANDKERCHIEF YET THE GALVANOMETER CHEMICAL PAPER THE SENSE OF SHOCK IN THE TONGUE AND A GOLD-LEAF ELECTROSCOPE WHICH WOULD DIVERGE AT TWO FEET FROM A HALF-INCH SPARK PLATE-GLASS MACHINE WERE NOT AFFECTED IN THE LEAST BY IT
MY EXPERIMENTING WAS ALL DONE IN THE SMALL SHOP OF A DOCTOR BRADLEY LOCATED NEAR THE STATION OF THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD IN JERSEY CITY
WE PUT IN RESISTANCE UP TO 500,000 OHMS AND THE TWITCHING WAS STILL PERCEPTIBLE
NO SERIOUS OBJECTIONS WERE RAISED BY HIS FAMILY FOR THE DISTANCE FROM PORT HURON WAS NOT GREAT AND STRATFORD WAS NEAR BAYFIELD THE OLD HOME FROM WHICH THE EDISONS HAD COME SO THAT THERE WERE DOUBTLESS FRIENDS OR EVEN RELATIVES IN THE VICINITY
THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE INVOLVED IN AUTOMATIC OR RAPID TELEGRAPHS EXCEPT THE PHOTOGRAPHIC ONES IS THAT OF PREPARING THE MESSAGE IN ADVANCE FOR DISPATCH BY PERFORATING NARROW STRIPS OF PAPER WITH HOLES--WORK WHICH CAN BE DONE EITHER BY HAND-PUNCHES OR BY TYPEWRITER APPARATUS
THIS WAS DONE BY TWO STRUCTURAL EXPERTS
LUCKILY THE BOILERS WERE UNHARMED
BUT SECRETS HAVE TO BE LONG-WINDED AND ROOST HIGH IF THEY WANT TO GET AWAY WHEN THE OLD MAN GOES HUNTING FOR THEM
GET HIM TO ADMIT THE BANK'S LIABILITY AND THEN SAY TO HIM THAT MR EDISON DOES NOT THINK THE BANK SHOULD SUFFER BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO HAVE A DISHONEST CLERK IN HIS EMPLOY
AT PRESENT WE WANT ENGINEERS INDUSTRIAL MEN GOOD BUSINESS-LIKE MANAGERS AND RAILROAD MEN IT IS HARDLY TO BE MARVELLED AT THAT SUCH VIEWS SHOULD ELICIT WARM PROTEST SUMMED UP IN THE COMMENT

FROM ITALY CAME PROFESSOR COLOMBO LATER A CABINET MINISTER WITH HIS FRIEND SIGNOR BUZZI OF MILAN
AS TO THE NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS WE MAY NOW QUOTE AGAIN FROM THE ARTICLE IN THE IRON AGE
AND IN NEWBURGH NEW YORK THE FOLLOWING SPRING
AS A MATTER OF FACT EDISON RETAINED A VERY LIVELY INTEREST IN ELECTRIC-RAILWAY PROGRESS LONG AFTER THE PREGNANT DAYS AT MENLO PARK ONE OF THE BEST EVIDENCES OF WHICH IS AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK ELECTRICAL ENGINEER OF NOVEMBER 18 1891 WHICH DESCRIBES SOME IMPORTANT AND ORIGINAL EXPERIMENTS IN THE DIRECTION OF ADAPTING ELECTRICAL CONDITIONS TO THE LARGER CITIES
FROM AMONG THESE MANY INVENTIONS HOWEVER WE WILL SELECT TWO OR THREE AS EXAMPLES OF INGENUITY AND IMPORTANCE IN THEIR BEARING UPON PRESENT PERFECTION OF RESULTS
TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH LORD KELVIN REMAINED ON TERMS OF WARMEST FRIENDSHIP WITH HIS AMERICAN CO-LABORER WITH WHOSE GENIUS HE THUS FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED AT PHILADELPHIA IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF FRANKLIN
WHEN THE ALTERNATING CURRENT WAS INTRODUCED FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES IT WAS NOT NEEDED FOR ARC LIGHTING THE CIRCUIT FOR WHICH FROM A SINGLE DYNAMO WOULD OFTEN BE TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES IN LENGTH ITS CURRENT HAVING A PRESSURE OF NOT LESS THAN FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND VOLTS
IN THE OLD WORLD SCIENTISTS GENERALLY STILL DECLARED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SUBDIVIDING THE ELECTRIC-LIGHT CURRENT AND IN THE PUBLIC PRESS MR EDISON WAS DENOUNCED AS A DREAMER
FOR WHILE MANY OF HIS OPPONENTS CAME TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE NOVELTY AND UTILITY OF HIS PLANS AND GAVE HIM UNSTINTED PRAISE THERE ARE DOUBTLESS OTHERS WHO TO THIS DAY PROFESS TO LOOK UPON HIM MERELY AS AN ADAPTER
ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAD BEEN RIPENING FAST
POSSIBLY SOME WERE ALREADY IN ATTENDANCE AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY
YET EVERY INDICATION IS CONFIRMATORY OF THE BELIEF THAT SUCH USE HAS BARELY BEGUN
ANOTHER CURIOUS LAW IS THIS
I CAN'T STAND PROSPERITY
WELL IT WAS A SERIOUS STATE OF THINGS AND I WORRIED OVER IT A LOT
PRENTICE THEN EDITOR OF THE COURIER-JOURNAL AND MR TYLER OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
HE WAS NOT CONTENT MERELY TO PROVIDE A ROOMY MODERATELY PRICED HOUSE THAT SHOULD BE FIREPROOF WATERPROOF AND VERMIN-PROOF AND PRACTICALLY INDESTRUCTIBLE BUT HAS BEEN SOLICITOUS TO GET AWAY FROM THE IDEA OF A PLAIN PACKING-BOX TYPE
BUT TO EDISON THESE SMALL PERFORATED STEEL TUBES HELD OUT AS MUCH OF A FASCINATION AT THE END OF FIVE YEARS AS WHEN THE SEARCH WAS FIRST BEGUN AND EVERY MORNING FOUND HIM AS EAGER TO BEGIN THE INVESTIGATION ANEW AS IF THE BATTERY WAS AN ABSOLUTELY NOVEL PROBLEM TO WHICH HIS THOUGHTS HAD JUST BEEN DIRECTED
IT WILL BE SEEN THEREFORE THAT THE SYSTEM CONSISTED IN A SINGLE ROPE PASSED OVER SHEAVES AND SO ARRANGED THAT IT COULD BE VARIED IN LENGTH THUS PROVIDING FOR ELASTICITY IN EXERTING PRESSURE AND REGULATING IT AS DESIRED

AND STRENGTH OF FIELD WERE REGULATED TO MAINTAIN THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE UPON THE SUPPLY-MAINS UNDER ALL CONDITIONS OF LOAD FROM THE MAXIMUM TO THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF LAMPS IN USE AND TO KEEP THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE OF ALL MACHINES ALIKE AMONG THE EARLIEST OF EDISON'S DYNAMO EXPERIMENTS WERE THOSE RELATING TO THE CORE OF THE ARMATURE
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG FELLOW THE FIRST THING I DID WHEN I WENT TO A TOWN WAS TO PUT SOMETHING INTO THE SAVINGS-BANK AND START AN ACCOUNT

EDISON ALTHOUGH IN THE FOREGOING PAGES THE READER HAS BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE TREMENDOUS IMPORT OF THE ACTUALITIES LYING BEHIND THOSE ETC ETC THE NARRATIVE UP TO THIS POINT HAS REVEALED EDISON CHIEFLY IN THE LIGHT OF INVENTOR EXPERIMENTER AND INVESTIGATOR
IT IS THE STORY OF THE PICKEREL AND THE ROACH
AFTER COOLING THE CLINKER IS GROUND INTO VERY FINE POWDER WHICH IS THE PORTLAND CEMENT OF COMMERCE
ON LOOKING AROUND THE WHOLE CROWD AT THE STATION WERE WATCHING--AND THEN I KNEW THE RABBIT WAS STUFFED
BY DOING THIS THE RESISTANCE WAS PUT WHERE IT WOULD TAKE UP THE LEAST ROOM AND WHERE IT WOULD SERVE AS AN ADDITIONAL FIELD-COIL WHEN STARTING THE MOTOR AND IT REPLACED ALL THE RESISTANCE-BOXES WHICH HAD HERETOFORE BEEN IN PLAIN SIGHT
HE WAS BROUGHT TO THE OFFICE AND SEVERAL MESSAGES WERE EXCHANGED THE CONTENTS OF WHICH OF COURSE I DID NOT KNOW BUT THE MATTER APPEARED TO BE VERY SERIOUS AS THEY WERE AFRAID OF GENERAL HOOD OF THE CONFEDERATE ARMY WHO WAS THEN ATTEMPTING TO MARCH ON NASHVILLE

UNFORTUNATELY THE SUGGESTION IS NOT PRACTICAL
AFTER THE EXPOSITION CLOSED THE OUTFIT WAS TAKEN DURING THE SAME YEAR TO THE EXPOSITION AT LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY WHERE IT WAS ALSO SUCCESSFUL CARRYING A LARGE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
I RUSHED OUT TO FIND THE SIGNALMAN BUT BEFORE I COULD FIND HIM AND GET THE SIGNAL SET THE TRAIN RAN PAST
HE HAS NOT HOWEVER HEARD OF IT SINCE
BUT THEY CONTINUED TO RECEIVE CHECKS AT BELDEN COMPANY'S FOR SOME TIME UNTIL THE STREET GOT WIND OF THE GAME
THIS WAS CONTINUED NOT THROUGH SO LONG A PERIOD AS THE EFFORT TO TAKE MY FRIEND CLARKE AND DEVOUR HIM BUT FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT THREE WEEKS
ONE OF THE EARLIEST SUGGESTIONS OF THE POSSIBILITY OF UTILIZING PHOTOGRAPHY FOR EXHIBITING THE ILLUSION OF ACTUAL MOVEMENT WAS MADE BY DUCOS WHO AS EARLY AS 1864 OBTAINED A PATENT IN FRANCE IN WHICH HE SAID
IN OPERATION THE PERFORATED TAPE IS PLACED ON THE TRANSMISSION DRUM AND THE CHEMICALLY PREPARED TAPE ON THE RECEIVING DRUM
WHILE FOR DEALINGS IN STOCKS THERE ALSO EXISTED THE REGULAR BOARD THE OPEN BOARD AND THE LONG ROOM DEVOTED TO ONE BUT THE LEADING OBJECT OF SPECULATION THE GOLD ROOM WAS THE VERY FOCUS OF ALL THE FINANCIAL AND GAMBLING ACTIVITY OF THE TIME AND ITS QUOTATIONS GOVERNED TRADE AND COMMERCE
I WAS ENGAGED READING A BOOK NEAR A TABLE IN THE FRONT WHILE EDISON WAS SEATED IN A CHAIR BY A TABLE NEAR THE ORGAN

THE LAMP MUST BE DURABLE CAPABLE OF BEING EASILY AND SAFELY HANDLED BY THE PUBLIC AND ONE THAT WOULD REMAIN CAPABLE OF BURNING AT FULL INCANDESCENCE AND CANDLE-POWER A GREAT LENGTH OF TIME
ALL THE ARGUMENTS THAT COULD BE URGED IN SUPPORT OF THIS INGENIOUS SYSTEM ARE TENABLE AND LOGICAL AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
THE YEAR 1881 WAS A MILE-STONE IN THE HISTORY OF THE ALLGEMEINE ELEKTRICITAETS GESELLSCHAFT
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SHUNT WITH SOFT IRON CORE INVENTED BY MR EDISON UTILIZING PROFESSOR HENRY'S DISCOVERY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION IN A SINGLE CIRCUIT TO PRODUCE A MOMENTARY REVERSAL OF THE LINE CURRENT AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE BATTERY IS THROWN OFF AND SO CUT OFF THE CHEMICAL MARKS SHARPLY AT THE PROPER INSTANT IS THE ELECTRICAL SECRET OF THE GREAT SPEED HE HAS ACHIEVED

THE FACT THAT EDISON CONFERRED AT THIS POINT WITH MR LOWREY SHOULD PERHAPS BE EXPLAINED IN JUSTICE TO THE DISTINGUISHED LAWYER WHO FOR SO MANY YEARS WAS THE CLOSE FRIEND OF THE INVENTOR AND THE CHIEF COUNSEL IN ALL THE TREMENDOUS LITIGATION THAT FOLLOWED THE EFFORT TO ENFORCE AND VALIDATE THE EDISON PATENTS
THIS CHARACTERISTIC TRAIT HAD GROWN STRONGER AS HE MATURED HAVING RECEIVED AS IT DID FRESH IMPETUS AND STRENGTH FROM HIS ONE LAPSE IN THE CASE OF HIS FIRST PATENTED INVENTION THE VOTE-RECORDER
THE MOTOR IS FOUNDED UPON THE PRINCIPLE DISCOVERED BY THE FAMOUS DR WILLIAM GILBERT--COURT PHYSICIAN TO QUEEN ELIZABETH AND THE FATHER OF MODERN ELECTRICITY--THAT THE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF IRON DIMINISH WITH HEAT
WHILE I AND MR SADLER ONE OF MY ASSISTANTS WERE WORKING NEAR IT THERE WAS A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHT AND A VERY SMART EXPLOSION
WHEN I MOVED TO MENLO PARK I TOOK OUT ONLY THE MACHINERY THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR EXPERIMENTAL PURPOSES AND LEFT THE MANUFACTURING MACHINERY IN THE PLACE

IT WAS THEN CONNECTED TO THE NERVES OF THE FROG BUT NO MOVEMENT OF ANY KIND COULD BE DETECTED UPON WORKING THE KEY ALTHOUGH THE BRILLIANCY AND POWER OF THE SPARK WERE UNDIMINISHED
GRAHAM BELL WAS ONE OF THE STOCKHOLDERS IN THE PHONOGRAPH COMPANY WHICH PAID EDISON $10,000 CASH AND A 20 PER CENT
BUT IT WAS TWO WEEKS BEFORE I COULD SEE
THIS RESULTS IN A PROJECTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS UPON A SCREEN IN SUCH RAPID SUCCESSION AS TO PRESENT AN APPARENTLY CONTINUOUS PHOTOGRAPH OF THE SUCCESSIVE POSITIONS OF THE MOVING OBJECTS WHICH THEREFORE APPEAR TO THE HUMAN EYE TO BE IN MOTION
AND THERE ALSO MR ETIENNE FODOR GENERAL MANAGER OF THE HUNGARIAN GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AT BUDAPEST RECEIVED HIS EARLY TRAINING
HE WOULD KEEP THIS UP UNTIL THE ROOM WAS FILLED NEARLY FLUSH WITH THE TABLE
WHEN THE CANVASS WAS OVER EDISON KNEW EXACTLY HOW MANY GAS JETS THERE WERE IN EVERY BUILDING IN THE ENTIRE DISTRICT THE AVERAGE HOURS OF BURNING AND THE COST OF LIGHT

DOCTOR BEARD WROTE A TREATISE OF SOME LENGTH ON THE SUBJECT IN WHICH HE CONCURRED WITH EDISON'S DEDUCTION THAT THE PHENOMENA WERE THE MANIFESTATION OF OSCILLATIONS OR RAPIDLY REVERSING WAVES OF ELECTRICITY WHICH DID NOT RESPOND TO THE USUAL TESTS
THIS LATTER OPERATION--"COPYING AS IT WAS CALLED--WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH TRULY ECONOMICAL BUSINESS PRACTICE
THE USES MADE OF THE PHONOGRAPH UP TO THIS TIME HAVE BEEN OF FOUR KINDS GENERALLY SPEAKING--FIRST AND PRINCIPALLY FOR AMUSEMENT
USERS OF KODAKS AND OTHER FORMS OF FILM CAMERAS WILL APPRECIATE PERHAPS BETTER THAN OTHERS THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IN THEIR WORK AFTER AN EXPOSURE THEY HAVE TO ADVANCE THE FILM FORWARD PAINFULLY TO THE EXTENT OF THE NEXT PICTURE BEFORE ANOTHER EXPOSURE CAN TAKE PLACE THESE OPERATIONS PERMITTING OF SPEEDS OF BUT A FEW PICTURES PER MINUTE AT BEST

ALMOST MIDWAY BETWEEN THE HOPPER AND THE BIN IS PLACED AN ELECTROMAGNET WHOSE POLAR EXTENSION IS SO ARRANGED AS TO BE A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE OF A STREAM OF MATERIAL FALLING FROM THE HOPPER
WHILE IT WAS A MATTER OF SUITING EDISON'S CONVENIENCE AS TO WHEN I SHOULD TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH HIM IT ALSO SUITED MY OWN IDEAS AS IT ENABLED ME AFTER GETTING THROUGH MY BUSINESS WITH HIM TO ENJOY THE PRIVILEGE OF WATCHING HIM AT HIS WORK AND TO LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF MATTERS

BUT WHEN THE CURRENT IS CUT OFF THE MAGNETIC EFFECT INSTANTLY CEASES
SOME OF THESE LIGHTS WERE ALREADY IN USE FOR LARGE INDOOR SPACES ALTHOUGH THE SIZE OF THE UNIT THE DEADLY PRESSURE OF THE CURRENT AND THE SPUTTERING SPARKS FROM THE CARBONS MADE THEM HIGHLY OBJECTIONABLE FOR SUCH PURPOSES

IT SEEMS THAT THE OFFICE BOY WAS DOWN ON THIS MAN
HE WAS HIGHLY EDUCATED AND HAD GREAT MENTAL CAPACITY
CANADIAN LUMBER WAS USED PRINCIPALLY IN THIS INDUSTRY
ON MY RETURN A FEW WEEKS LATER HIS EXPERIMENTS HAD RUN UP TO OVER TEN THOUSAND BUT HE HAD DISCOVERED THE MISSING LINK IN THE COMBINATION SOUGHT FOR
A VERY LONG STRIP

I WOULD TALK FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS MUSIC
BELL TOOK UP IMMEDIATELY AND ENERGETICALLY THE IDEA THAT HIS TWO PREDECESSORS HAD DROPPED--AND REACHED THE GOAL
HENCE WE WILL NOW BEGIN AT THE ROOT OF THIS OPERATION AND CONSIDER THE GIANT ROLLS WHICH EDISON DEVISED FOR BREAKING HUGE MASSES OF ROCK
EDISON HAS PITHILY SUMMED UP HIS WORK AND HIS VIEWS IN AN ARTICLE ON THE TO-MORROWS OF ELECTRICITY AND INVENTION IN POPULAR ELECTRICITY FOR JUNE 1910 IN WHICH HE SAYS
THESE ROLLS ARE MOUNTED SIDE BY SIDE IN A VERY HEAVY FRAME LEAVING A GAP OF ABOUT FOURTEEN INCHES BETWEEN THEM AND ARE SO BELTED UP WITH THE SOURCE OF POWER THAT THEY RUN IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE EITHER EDISON TELLS ALSO OF ANOTHER FOOLHARDY LABORATORY TRICK OF THE SAME KIND
IN THE MEREST FRACTION OF A SECOND AS THE PERFORATED PAPER CONTINUES TO PASS OVER THE TRANSMISSION DRUM THE ROLLERS 5 OR 7 CLOSE THE CIRCUIT THROUGH OTHER PERFORATIONS AND T E CURRENT PASSES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OVER THE LINE WIRE THROUGH PINS 1 OR 3 AND RETURNS THROUGH THE EARTH
THERE ARE MANY MEN OF EQUAL BODILY AND MENTAL VIGOR WHO HAVE NOT ACHIEVED A TITHE OF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENT
IN HIS RESEARCHES TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE MOTOGRAPH PHENOMENA AND TO OPEN UP OTHER SOURCES OF ELECTRICAL CURRENT GENERATION EDISON HAS WORKED OUT A VERY INGENIOUS AND SOMEWHAT PERPLEXING PIECE OF APPARATUS KNOWN AS THE CHALK BATTERY IT CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF CHALK CYLINDERS MOUNTED ON A SHAFT REVOLVED BY HAND
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS BEING EMPIRICAL
THIS WAS MADE BY HIM TO ONE OF THE WRITERS A SHORT TIME AGO WHEN AFTER AN INTERESTING INDULGENCE IN REMINISCENCES OF OLD TIMES AND EARLY INVENTIONS HE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND WITH A BROAD SMILE ON HIS FACE SAID REFLECTIVELY
FOX AND I TOOK OUR WINCHESTER RIFLES WITH AN IDEA OF DOING A LITTLE SHOOTING
WHILE I GAVE THEM MY OPINION IT WAS RELUCTANTLY
28 1882 272,034 TELEPHONE
NOTHING COULD BE MORE COMPLETE THAN THE ORGANIZATION AND DISCIPLINE OF THIS BODY OF BRAVE AND INTELLIGENT MEN
THE CLEARING-HOUSE FOR GOLD HAD BEEN SWAMPED AND ALL WAS MIXED UP
BUT ON THE CONTRARY THE OLD SPIRIT OF GOOD-HUMOR AND PRANKISHNESS WAS EVER PRESENT AS ITS FREQUENT OUTBURSTS MANIFESTED FROM TIME TO TIME
HE THOUGHT THAT TOO FREQUENT CIRCULATION OF A COMPARATIVELY SMALL QUANTITY OF OIL WOULD TO SOME EXTENT IMPAIR ITS LUBRICATING QUALITIES AND REQUESTED HIS ASSISTANTS TO VERIFY THIS OPINION BY CONSULTATION WITH COMPETENT AUTHORITIES
88 BRAZIL 1 CANADA 129 CAPE OF GOOD HOPE
IT WAS A DEPRESSING SIGHT MARKING SUCH TITANIC BUT FUTILE STRUGGLES WITH NATURE
ANOTHER TIME WE EXPERIMENTED WITH A TUB FULL OF SOAPY WATER AND PUT HYDROGEN INTO IT TO MAKE LARGE BUBBLES
HE LOST ALL INTEREST IN THE EXPERIMENTS AFTER THAT AND I WAS ORDERED BACK TO AMERICA EDISON STATES HOWEVER THAT THE AUTOMATIC WAS FINALLY ADOPTED IN ENGLAND AND USED FOR MANY YEARS
THESE PROVED EVEN MORE SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIALLY CONSIDERED THAN THE CARBONIZED THREAD--SO MUCH SO THAT AFTER A NUMBER OF SUCH LAMPS HAD BEEN MADE AND PUT THROUGH SEVERE TESTS THE MANUFACTURE OF LAMPS FROM THESE PAPER CARBONS WAS BEGUN AND CARRIED ON CONTINUOUSLY
ONE OUGHT TO ADD THE CONTENTS OF AN UNFINISHED PIECE OF EXTRAORDINARY FICTION BASED WHOLLY ON NEW INVENTIONS AND DEVICES UTTERLY UNKNOWN TO MANKIND
FINALLY THE FUEL CONSUMPTION IS REDUCED WHICH IN THE CASE OF THE EASTERN PLANTS WITH THEIR RELATIVELY COSTLY COKE IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION
ADAMS J
AS THOREAU SAID
HE BEING A LARGE SUTLER WANTED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO SAVE HIS GOODS
ONE OF THE CARS EQUIPPED WITH HIS BATTERY IS THE BAILEY AND MR BEE TELLS THE FOLLOWING STORY IN REGARD TO IT
IN THE BOSTON TELEGRAPH OFFICE AT THAT TIME AS PERHAPS AT OTHERS THERE WERE OPERATORS STUDYING TO ENTER COLLEGE
IT WAS THE INTENTION THEREFORE THAT THE CURRENT SHOULD ENTER THE LOCOMOTIVE WHEELS AT ONE SIDE AND AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE METAL SPIDERS COLLECTING BRUSHES AND MOTOR WOULD PASS OUT THROUGH THE CORRESPONDING BRUSHES SPIDERS AND WHEELS TO THE OTHER RAIL AS TO THE ROAD
I TOLD HIM ONE STORY AFTER THE OTHER--SIX OF THEM
HENCE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT AS IN MANY OTHER ARTS HE MADE A LASTING IMPRESSION IN THIS ONE BY THE INTRINSIC MERITS OF THE IMPROVEMENTS RESULTING FROM HIS WORK THEREIN
ANOTHER NOTABLE MAN OF THIS STAMP WITH WHOM EDISON WAS THROWN IN CONTACT WAS THE LATE MR CHARLES WILLIAMS WHO BEGINNING HIS CAREER IN THE ELECTRICAL FIELD IN THE FORTIES WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF ACTIVITY AS A MAKER OF APPARATUS WHEN EDISON ARRIVED IN THE CITY
15 1883 425,761 INCANDESCENT LAMP
THE GROUND FLOOR CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF BROAD DRAWING-ROOMS PARLORS AND DINING-HALL IS CHIEFLY NOTEWORTHY FOR THE DEN OR LOUNGING-ROOM AT THE END OF THE MAIN AXIS WHERE THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE LIKELY TO BE FOUND IN THE EVENING HOURS UNLESS THE PARTY HAS WITHDRAWN FOR MORE INTIMATE SOCIAL INTERCOURSE TO THE INTERESTING AND FASCINATING PRIVATE LIBRARY ON THE FLOOR ABOVE

THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU AN OLD BRIDGEWATER CANAL WIRE THAT IS SO POOR WE DON'T WORK IT AND A LOT OF SAND BATTERIES AT LIVERPOOL 4 THE SITUATION WAS RATHER DEPRESSING TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN THUS ENCOUNTERING FOR THE FIRST TIME THE STOLID CONSERVATISM AND OPPOSITION TO CHANGE THAT CHARACTERIZES SO MUCH OF OFFICIAL LIFE AND METHODS IN EUROPE
I MADE HIM A PERSONAL GUARANTEE THAT IF HE WOULD TAKE HOLD OF THE STATION AND PUT IT ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS AND PAY 5 PER CENT
THE DYNAMO WAS PROBABLY NEEDED FOR EDISON'S OWN EXPERIMENTS
IN THE EDISON LABORATORY NO SUCH WEIRD TRANSFORMATION HAS BEEN NECESSARY FOR THE PHILOSOPHER HAD YOUTH FIERY ENERGY AND A GRIMLY PRACTICAL DETERMINATION THAT WOULD SUBMIT TO NO DENIAL OF THE GOAL OF SOMETHING OF REAL BENEFIT TO MANKIND
FOUR MANUFACTURERS WERE SOON BUSY TRYING TO KEEP PACE WITH THE DEMANDS FOR IT FROM BROKERS
BUT EDISON DISCOVERED THAT BY UTILIZING A SHUNT AROUND THE RECEIVING INSTRUMENT WITH A SOFT IRON CORE THE SELF-INDUCTION WOULD PRODUCE A MOMENTARY AND INSTANTANEOUS REVERSAL OF THE CURRENT AT THE END OF EACH IMPULSE AND THEREBY GIVE AN ABSOLUTELY SHARP DEFINITION TO EACH SIGNAL
IN ADDITION TO THESE ADVANTAGES THE STREETS WOULD BE FREED FROM THEIR BURDEN OF TROLLEY WIRES OR CONDUITS
A MOST REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF CONTEMPORANEOUS INVENTION AND WITHOUT A PARALLEL IN THE ANNALS OF THE UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE OCCURRED WHEN ON THE SAME DAY FEBRUARY 15 1876 TWO SEPARATE DESCRIPTIONS WERE FILED IN THAT OFFICE ONE A COMPLETE APPLICATION AND THE OTHER A CAVEAT BUT EACH COVERING AN INVENTION FOR TRANSMITTING VOCAL SOUNDS TELEGRAPHICALLY THE APPLICATION WAS MADE BY ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL OF SALEM MASSACHUSETTS AND THE CAVEAT BY ELISHA GRAY OF CHICAGO ILLINOIS
THAT THE PRINCE WAS A YOUNG STRIPLING AND DID NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS
HE HIMSELF IN JANUARY 1879 MADE PERSONALLY A MOST MINUTE AND SEARCHING INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROPERTIES AND BEHAVIOR OF PLATING-IRIDIUM BORON RUTILE ZIRCON CHROMIUM MOLYBDENUM AND NICKEL UNDER VARYING DEGREES OF CURRENT STRENGTH ON WHICH THERE MAY BE FOUND IN THE NOTES ABOUT FORTY PAGES OF DETAILED EXPERIMENTS AND DEDUCTIONS IN HIS OWN HANDWRITING CONCLUDING WITH THE REMARK ABOUT NICKEL
MR ANDREWS RELATES A RATHER HUMOROUS METER STORY OF THOSE EARLY DAYS
AND IT WAS PROBABLY A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THIS LESSON WAS LEARNED AT THE OUTSET OF HIS CAREER AS AN INVENTOR
THE NEXT MORNING I WAS FOUND IN BED AND RECEIVED A GOOD SWITCHING ON THE LEGS FROM MY FATHER THE FIRST AND ONLY ONE I EVER RECEIVED FROM HIM ALTHOUGH MY MOTHER KEPT A SWITCH BEHIND THE OLD SETH THOMAS CLOCK THAT HAD THE BARK WORN OFF
7 WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD
HIS EXPLANATIONS WERE SIMPLE
HERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS THERE WAS CEASELESS ACTIVITY IN THE PREPARATION OF THESE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS BY EVERY IMAGINABLE PROCESS AND SUBSEQUENT TESTING
AND ALTOGETHER HE WAS A TOUGH CHARACTER
THE IMPORTER EXPLAINED THAT IN CHINA HUMAN LABOR WAS CHEAPER THAN STEAM POWER
NEVER HAVING SEEN HIM I WENT WHILE IN NEW YORK TO CALL UPON HIM
THEN I REALIZED THAT THE TELEGRAPH WAS A GREAT INVENTION
13 1883 281,349 REGULATOR FOR DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINES JAN
THIS INCREASE IN OUTPUT OF COURSE MEANS A REDUCTION IN THE COST OF LABOR AND OF GENERAL EXPENSES
SO I CONCEIVED OF AN ENGINE EMPLOYING GUNCOTTON
PREVIOUS TO TRYING WE TESTED ITS SENSIBILITY BY THE CURRENT FROM A SINGLE BUNSEN CELL
BUT THE ART WAS STILL VERY YOUNG AND THE PLANT REPRESENTED PIONEER LIGHTING PRACTICE IN THE EMPIRE
MR CHARLES L
THE FIRST ISSUE OF JANUARY 12 1882 WAS ONLY FOUR PAGES BUT IT DEALT WITH THE QUESTION OF INSURANCE
THE HOBBY HE HAD AT THE TIME I WAS THERE SAYS EDISON WAS THE AGING OF RAW WHISKEY BY PASSING STRONG ELECTRIC CURRENTS THROUGH IT
THE IDENTITY OF ELECTRICITY AND THE THUNDER-STORM FLASH
WHEN A STORAGE BATTERY IS CHARGED BY HAVING AN ELECTRIC CURRENT PASSED THROUGH IT THE ELECTRIC ENERGY PRODUCES A CHEMICAL EFFECT ADDING OXYGEN TO THE POSITIVE PLATE AND TAKING OXYGEN AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE PLATE
HERE MAY BE FOUND THE POPULAR MAGAZINES TOGETHER WITH THOSE OF A TECHNICAL NATURE RELATING TO ELECTRICITY CHEMISTRY ENGINEERING MECHANICS BUILDING CEMENT BUILDING MATERIALS DRUGS WATER AND GAS POWER AUTOMOBILES RAILROADS AERONAUTICS PHILOSOPHY HYGIENE PHYSICS TELEGRAPHY MINING METALLURGY METALS MUSIC AND OTHERS
THE WORK IN PARIS LONDON STRASBURG AND MOSCOW
ALL BEING IN READINESS THE PRINCIPAL WAS TOLD TO BRING IN HER CHILDREN
FOR IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE COURTS HAVE SOMEWHAT NARROWED THE BROAD CLAIMS OF EDISON'S PATENTS BY REASON OF THE INVESTIGATIONS OF EARLIER EXPERIMENTERS PRACTICALLY ALL THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL WORK THAT IS DONE IN THE MOTION-PICTURE FIELD TO-DAY IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF APPARATUS AND METHODS LICENSED UNDER THE EDISON PATENTS
ALTHOUGH THE JOURNEY OCCURRED IN BALMY JUNE IT WAS NECESSARILY ATTENDED WITH DIFFICULTY AND PRIVATION
THE FLOOR BEING WET HE FORMED A CIRCUIT AND UP WENT HIS HANDS
IT WAS LITERALLY THE BEGINNING OF THE ELECTRICAL ILLUMINATION OF AMERICAN EXPOSITIONS CARRIED LATER TO SUCH SPLENDID DISPLAYS AS THOSE OF THE CHICAGO WORLD'S FAIR IN 1893 BUFFALO IN 1901 AND ST LOUIS IN 1904
4 1879 223,898 ELECTRIC LAMP
AND JUST AS A LARGE PROPORTION OF AMERICAN TROLLEY SYSTEMS DO AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT
THE EMINENT SCIENTIST JOHN TYNDALL WHILE NOT SHARING THESE PRECISE VIEWS AT LEAST AS LATE AS JANUARY 17 1879 DELIVERED A LECTURE BEFORE THE ROYAL INSTITUTION ON THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WHEN AFTER POINTING OUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ART UP TO EDISON'S WORK AND SHOWING THE APPARENT HOPELESSNESS OF THE PROBLEM HE SAID
THE APPLICATION WAS FILED MAY 23 1885 AT THE TIME HE WAS WORKING ON INDUCTION TELEGRAPHY TWO YEARS BEFORE THE PUBLICATION OF THE WORK OF HERTZ BUT THE PATENT NO
ONE MORNING AT MENLO PARK A GENTLEMAN CAME TO THE LABORATORY AND ASKED TO SEE THE PHONOGRAPH
MY REPORT WAS THAT THE SYSTEM WAS SOUND FUNDAMENTALLY THAT IT CONTAINED THE GERM OF A GOOD THING BUT NEEDED WORKING OUT
21 1880 242,900 MANUFACTURING CARBONS FOR ELECTRIC LAMPS
TO ENTER IN AND POSSESS THE LAND REQUIRED THE CONFIDENCE OF CAPITAL AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC
THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR AT PORT HURON KNOWING OF HIS PROFICIENCY AND WANTING TO GET INTO THE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH CORPS WHERE THE PAY IN THOSE DAYS OF THE CIVIL WAR WAS HIGH SUCCEEDED IN CONVINCING HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW MR M
BUT THE RETROSPECT INDICATES THAT MANY REFORMS AND POLITICAL CHANGES WERE ACCOMPLISHED ALTHOUGH THE PROCESS INVOLVED THE EXILE OF NOT A FEW ARDENT SPIRITS TO AMERICA TO BECOME LEADING STATESMEN INVENTORS JOURNALISTS AND FINANCIERS
SUCH IN BRIEF WAS THE STATE OF THE ART GENERALLY SPEAKING AT THE PERIOD ABOVE NAMED 1878-79 AS EARLY IN THE ART AS THE LATTER END OF THE YEAR 1878 EDISON HAD DEVELOPED HIS IDEAS SUFFICIENTLY TO DETERMINE THAT THE PROBLEM OF ELECTRIC ILLUMINATION BY SMALL UNITS COULD BE SOLVED BY USING INCANDESCENT LAMPS OF HIGH RESISTANCE AND SMALL RADIATING SURFACE AND BY DISTRIBUTING CURRENTS OF CONSTANT POTENTIAL THERETO IN MULTIPLE ARC BY MEANS OF A RAMIFICATION OF CONDUCTORS STARTING FROM A CENTRAL SOURCE AND BRANCHING THEREFROM IN EVERY DIRECTION
WHEN THE KEY IS RELEASED THE BATTERY IS AGAIN CONNECTED TO EARTH
THE GOAL HAD BEEN REACHED
ROOSEVELT A FAMOUS ORGAN BUILDER AND UNCLE OF EX-PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT CONCERTS WERE GIVEN AT WHICH THE PHONOGRAPH WAS FEATURED TO MANAGE THIS NOVEL SHOW BUSINESS THE SERVICES OF JAMES REDPATH WERE CALLED INTO REQUISITION WITH GREAT SUCCESS
THE BUILDING WAS IN PLAIN SIGHT FROM THE OFFICE AND FOUR STORIES HIGH
THOSE QUALITIES MAY NOT BE AMIABLE BUT GREAT WEALTH IS HARDLY EVER ACCUMULATED WITHOUT THEM
EDISON'S INVENTIVE WORK ON STOCK PRINTERS HAS LEFT ITS MARK UPON THE ART AS IT EXISTS AT THE PRESENT TIME

GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF THE CONSUMPTION OF GAS JANUARY TO DECEMBER
IT OFTEN HAPPENED THAT WHEN EDISON HAD BEEN WORKING UP TO THREE OR FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING HE WOULD LIE DOWN ON ONE OF THE LABORATORY TABLES AND WITH NOTHING BUT A COUPLE OF BOOKS FOR A PILLOW WOULD FALL INTO A SOUND SLEEP
THE KEEPER OF THE GATE WAS USUALLY CHOSEN WITH REFERENCE TO HIS CAPACITY FOR STONY-HEARTED IMPLACABILITY AND ADHERENCE TO INSTRUCTIONS
VARIOUS FORMS OF APPARATUS FOLLOWING THIS GENERAL TYPE WERE MADE BUT THEY WERE ALL OPEN TO THE SERIOUS OBJECTION THAT THE VERY RAPID EMULSIONS EMPLOYED WERE RELATIVELY COARSE-GRAINED AND PREVENTED THE SECURING OF SHARP PICTURES OF MICROSCOPIC SIZE
BUT THERE WAS NO ELECTRIC DRIVING UNTIL 1880 WHEN MR PORTER INSTALLED A HIGH-SPEED ENGINE FOR EDISON AT HIS LABORATORY IN MENLO PARK
IF REDUCED TO THREE-QUARTERS OF AN INCH IT WILL HAVE ON THAT THREE-QUARTERS OF AN INCH 1600 DEGREES FAHR NOTWITHSTANDING THE ORIGINAL TOTAL AMOUNT WAS BUT 1200 BECAUSE THE RADIATION HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THREE-QUARTERS OR 75 UNITS
THERE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY ONE OF THE BEST OPERATORS WE HAD WHO WORKED DAYTIME AND WHO WAS OF A VERY QUIET DISPOSITION EXCEPT WHEN INTOXICATED
NEEDLESS TO SAY THE WORKING OUT OF THE CONDITIONS AND PROCESSES OF MANUFACTURE OF THE MATERIALS HAS INVOLVED GREAT INGENUITY AND ENDLESS EXPERIMENTATION THE ARTICLE THEN TREATS OF EDISON'S INVESTIGATIONS INTO MEANS FOR SUPPORTING AND MAKING ELECTRICAL CONNECTION WITH THE ACTIVE MATERIALS SHOWING SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED AND THE VARIOUS DISCOVERIES MADE IN DEVELOPING THE PERFECTED CELL AFTER WHICH THE WRITER CONTINUES HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE A TYPE CELL AS FOLLOWS
EDISON'S OWN WISHES WERE ALTOGETHER FOR THE USE OF THE METHODS HE HAD SO CAREFULLY DEVISED
THE TYPE OF EDISON'S FIRST DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINE THE DESCRIPTION OF WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE ABOVE CONTROVERSY IS SHOWN IN FIG
EDISON'S PROBLEM IN EDUCATING THE PUBLIC WAS RATHER DIFFICULT FOR WHILE HIS LOW-PRESSURE DIRECT-CURRENT SYSTEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT DANGER TO LIFE THERE HAS ALSO BEEN THE UNDENIABLE FACT THAT ESCAPING ELECTRICITY MIGHT CAUSE A FIRE JUST AS A LEAKY WATER-PIPE CAN FLOOD A HOUSE
THE POINT X OF VIBRATOR WAS NOW CONNECTED TO THE GAS-PIPE AND STILL THE SPARKS COULD BE DRAWN FROM THE STOVE PUT A COIL OF WIRE OVER THE END OF ROD X AND PASSED THE ENDS OF SPOOL THROUGH GALVANOMETER WITHOUT AFFECTING IT IN ANY WAY
HE RENTED POWER FROM A JEW WHO OWNED THE BUILDING
THE BOY WAS INDEFATIGABLE BUT NOT ALTOGETHER CHARMED WITH AGRICULTURE
ON COMING TO CONSIDER THE EDISON BATTERY ENTERPRISES WE MUST PERFORCE EXTEND THE TERRITORIAL VIEW TO INCLUDE A SPECIAL CHEMICAL-MANUFACTURING PLANT WHICH IS IN REALITY A BRANCH OF THE LABORATORY AND THE ORANGE WORKS ALTHOUGH ACTUALLY SITUATED ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY
INDEED IT WOULD BE STRANGE AND UNACCOUNTABLE WERE THE RESULTS OTHERWISE
HERE HE BUILT THEIR ORIGINAL TYPE OF APPARATUS AS IMPROVED AND ALSO PUSHED HIS EXPERIMENTS ON THE LETTER SYSTEM SO FAR THAT AT A TEST BETWEEN NEW YORK AND PHILADELPHIA THREE THOUSAND WORDS WERE SENT IN ONE MINUTE AND RECORDED IN ROMAN TYPE
IT MIGHT APPEAR STRANGE ON THE SURFACE BUT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT MOST INFLUENCED EDISON TO REGRETS IN CONNECTION WITH THE BIG TRADE OF 1889 WAS THAT IT SEPARATED HIM FROM HIS OLD FRIEND AND ALLY BERGMANN WHO ON SELLING OUT SAW A GREAT FUTURE FOR HIMSELF IN GERMANY WENT THERE AND REALIZED IT
WEIR LATE PRESIDENT OF THE ADAMS EXPRESS
I GOT THE MORNING PAPERS WHICH CAME OUT AT 4 A
IN THIS AND OTHER WAYS IT BECAME POPULARIZED TO A STILL FURTHER EXTENT
IT WAS INDEED A PATHETIC SIGHT TO SEE A FATHER VENERATE HIS SON AS THE ELDER EDISON DID NOT LESS AT HOME WAS MR MACKENZIE THE MT
ALL BEING IN READINESS THE ACTUAL PICTURE IS TAKEN THE ACTORS GOING THROUGH THEIR REHEARSED PARTS THE PRODUCER STANDING OUT OF THE RANGE OF THE CAMERA AND WITH A MEGAPHONE TO HIS LIPS YELLING OUT HIS INSTRUCTIONS IMPRECATIONS AND APPROVAL AND THE CAMERA MAN GRINDING AT THE CRANK OF THE CAMERA AND SECURING THE PICTURES AT THE RATE OF TWENTY OR MORE PER SECOND MAKING A FAITHFUL AND PERMANENT RECORD OF EVERY MOVEMENT AND EVERY CHANGE OF FACIAL EXPRESSION
EDISON OF NEW JERSEY IN 1873 AND SAYS OF IT
IN STRICT TERMINOLOGY IT IS A REVERSIBLE BATTERY AS WILL BE QUITE OBVIOUS IF WE GLANCE BRIEFLY AT ITS PHILOSOPHY
E WHERE THE CIRCUIT IS NECESSARILY OPENED AND CLOSED AS IN TELEGRAPHY ALTHOUGH OF COURSE AT AN ENORMOUSLY HIGHER RATE WHICH HAS NEVER PROVED PRACTICAL
WHERE BOTH CAPITAL AND LABOR ARE AGREED THAT THE OBJECT IS WORTHY OF ENCOURAGEMENT THERE IS THE SUPREME INDIFFERENCE OF THE PUBLIC TO OVERCOME AND THE STUBBORN RESISTANCE OF PRE-EXISTING DEVICES TO COMBAT

WHEN THE CURRENT WAS REVERSED THE FRICTION WAS GREATLY INCREASED OVER WHAT IT WAS WHEN NO CURRENT WAS PASSING
CAN THE EDISON COMPANY EXPLAIN THIS
THAT WAS WITHIN AN INCH OF YOUR LIFE AS THEY SAY
THERE WAS AN ELEVATOR THERE AND EACH DAY WHILE IT WAS TRAVELLING UP I HELD THE STEM OF MY WATERBURY WATCH UP AGAINST THE COLUMN IN THE ELEVATOR SHAFT AND IT FINISHED THE WINDING BY THE TIME I GOT UP THE SIX STORIES THIS ORIGINAL METHOD OF REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL LABOR INVOLVED IN WATCH-WINDING BRINGS TO MIND ANOTHER INSTANCE OF SHREWDNESS MENTIONED BY EDISON WITH REGARD TO HIS NEWSBOY DAYS

31 1878 218,166 MAGNETO ELECTRIC MACHINES
WE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED SAYS EDISON OF THIS PERIOD IN CINCINNATI AND HE WANTED ME TO INVENT A SECRET METHOD OF SENDING DESPATCHES SO THAT AN INTERMEDIATE OPERATOR COULD NOT TAP THE WIRE AND UNDERSTAND IT
THESE LENGTHS OF CONDUCTORS WERE TWENTY FEET SIX INCHES LONG AS THE HALF-ROUND COPPERS EXTENDED THREE INCHES BEYOND THE DRAG-ENDS OF THE LENGTHS OF PIPE
THE NEXT STATION WAS MOUNT CLEMENS NOW A WATERING-PLACE BUT THEN A TOWN OF ABOUT ONE THOUSAND
THEN HE TOOK A BAMBOO FISH-POLE PUT A PIECE OF PAPER AT THE END AND TOUCHED IT OFF
KNOWING THAT A FORMER OPERATOR NAMED ADAMS WHO HAD WORKED WITH ME IN THE CINCINNATI OFFICE WAS IN BOSTON I WROTE HIM THAT I WANTED A JOB THERE
AND THEY WERE MADE BY THE MILLION
AND NOW HE HAD STEPPED OVER THE THRESHOLD OF A NEW ART WHICH HAS SINCE BECOME SO WORLD-WIDE IN ITS APPLICATION AS TO BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF MODERN HUMAN EXPERIENCE
GEORGE WASHINGTON CHILDS WAS VERY ANXIOUS I SHOULD GO DOWN TO PHILADELPHIA TO DINE WITH HIM

THE FIELD-MAGNET CIRCUITS OF THE DYNAMOS WERE CONNECTED IN MULTIPLE WITH A SEPARATE ENERGIZING SOURCE
NEXT COMES THE POURING OF THE CONCRETE MIXTURE INTO THIS FORM
OTHER CURIOUS EFFECTS ARE SECURED BY TAKING THE PICTURES AT A DIFFERENT SPEED FROM THAT AT WHICH THEY ARE EXHIBITED
AT AN EARLY PERIOD AT 65 WE DECIDED SAYS EDISON TO LIGHT IT UP WITH THE EDISON SYSTEM AND PUT A GAS-ENGINE IN THE CELLAR USING CITY GAS
IT CONSISTED OF MANY MILLING MACHINES AND OTHER TOOLS FOR DUPLICATING
BRIEFLY DESCRIBED THE PROCESS CONSISTED IN MIXING THE CONCENTRATES WITH THE SPECIAL BINDING MATERIAL IN MACHINES OF AN ENTIRELY NEW TYPE AND IN PASSING THE RESULTANT PASTY MASS INTO THE BRIQUETTING MACHINES WHERE IT WAS PRESSED INTO CYLINDRICAL CAKES THREE INCHES IN DIAMETER AND ONE AND A HALF INCHES THICK UNDER SUCCESSIVE PRESSURES OF 7800 14,000 AND 60,000 POUNDS
WE FIGURED CAREFULLY OVER THE PROBABILITIES OF FINANCIAL RETURNS FROM THE PHONOGRAPH WORKS AND OTHER ENTERPRISES AND AFTER DISCUSSING MANY PLANS IT WAS FINALLY DECIDED THAT WE WOULD APPLY THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAD GAINED IN THE CONCENTRATING PLANT BY BUILDING A PLANT FOR MANUFACTURING PORTLAND CEMENT AND THAT MR EDISON WOULD DEVOTE HIS ATTENTION TO THE DEVELOPING OF A STORAGE BATTERY WHICH DID NOT USE LEAD AND SULPHURIC ACID
THE FACTS AND LAWS OF PHYSICS WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MATHEMATICAL LOGIC NEVER FAIL TO FURNISH PRECIOUS ANSWERS TO SUCH QUESTIONS THE WOULD-BE CRITIC THEN GOES ON TO TABULATE TESTS OF CERTAIN OTHER DYNAMO MACHINES BY A COMMITTEE OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE IN 1879 THE RESULTS OF WHICH SHOWED THAT THESE MACHINES RETURNED ABOUT 50 PER CENT
TRAIN TELEGRAPHY WHILE THE ONE-TIME ART OF TELEGRAPHING TO AND FROM MOVING TRAINS WAS ESSENTIALLY A WIRELESS SYSTEM AND ALLIED IN SOME OF ITS PRINCIPLES TO THE ART OF MODERN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY THROUGH SPACE THE TWO SYSTEMS CANNOT STRICTLY SPEAKING BE REGARDED AS IDENTICAL AS THE PRACTICE OF THE FORMER WAS BASED ENTIRELY ON THE PHENOMENON OF INDUCTION
THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT SPECIES OF BATTERY ONE BEING KNOWN AS PRIMARY AND THE OTHER AS STORAGE ALTHOUGH THE LATTER IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS A SECONDARY BATTERY OR ACCUMULATOR EVERY TYPE OF EACH OF THESE TWO SPECIES IS ESSENTIALLY ALIKE IN ITS GENERAL MAKE-UP
I FOUND THE TROUBLE FINALLY AND THE PRACTICAL INTRODUCTION ON THE LEHIGH VALLEY ROAD WAS THE RESULT
BEFORE ALL HAD ARRIVED THE BELL COMPANY THERE SEEING WE COULD NOT BE STOPPED ENTERED INTO NEGOTIATIONS FOR CONSOLIDATION
I ALSO READ THE CLIPPER THE POLICE GAZETTE THE BILLBOARD THE DRAMATIC MIRROR AND A LOT OF SIMILAR PUBLICATIONS FOR I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
NOTE.--THE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THIS ARTICLE ARE REPRODUCED FROM AMERICAN TELEGRAPHY AND ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE TELEGRAPH BY WILLIAM MAVER JR BY PERMISSION OF MAVER PUBLISHING COMPANY NEW YORK
IT WAS OF THE GRAMME TYPE AS OUR FIRST DYNAMO OF THE EDISON DESIGN WAS NOT YET FINISHED
ALL THIS WAS HEARD CLEARLY BY A VERY LARGE AUDIENCE AND WAS REPEATED ON OTHER EVENINGS
THE BOILERS WERE FIRED BY WOOD AS THE ECONOMICAL TRANSPORTATION OF COAL WAS A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY
IN THE YEAR LAST NAMED EDISON FIRST BROUGHT OUT HIS NEW FORM OF NICKEL-IRON CELL WITH ALKALINE ELECTROLYTE AS WE HAVE RELATED IN THE PRECEDING NARRATIVE
IT DID NOT TAKE A LONG TIME TO FIND A MARKET FOR THE PRODUCTS OF THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED FACTORY FOR A WORLD-WIDE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE MACHINE HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE APPEARANCE OF NEWSPAPER ARTICLES FROM TIME TO TIME ANNOUNCING THE APPROACHING COMPLETION BY EDISON OF HIS IMPROVED PHONOGRAPH
I FELT CERTAIN THAT THERE MUST BE LARGE BODIES OF MAGNETITE IN THE EAST WHICH IF CRUSHED AND CONCENTRATED WOULD SATISFY THE WANTS OF THE EASTERN FURNACES FOR STEEL-MAKING
THIS DIFFICULTY WILL BE APPARENT FOR INSTANCE WHEN WE CONSIDER HIS TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE INVENTIONS

AS A GENERAL RULE EDISON DOES NOT GET GENUINELY ANGRY AT MISTAKES AND OTHER HUMAN WEAKNESSES OF HIS SUBORDINATES
THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD RAN SPECIAL TRAINS
HE WAS A FIRST-CLASS RECEIVER AND RAPID SENDER
MANY A TIME DURING THE LONG WEARY NIGHTS OF EXPERIMENTING EDISON WOULD CALL A HALT FOR REFRESHMENTS WHICH HE HAD ORDERED ALWAYS TO BE SENT IN WHEN NIGHT-WORK WAS IN PROGRESS

IT WAS THROUGH THIS INCIDENT THAT EDISON ACQUIRED THE DEAFNESS THAT HAS PERSISTED ALL THROUGH HIS LIFE A SEVERE BOX ON THE EARS FROM THE SCORCHED AND ANGRY CONDUCTOR BEING THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE INFIRMITY
UNTIL THE LATE AFTERNOON WHEN THE TRAIN LEFT ARRIVING AT PORT HURON ABOUT 9.30 P.M
HENCE ALL HIS CONCEPTIONS FOLLOWED THIS GENERAL PRINCIPLE SO FAITHFULLY AND COMPLETELY THAT WE FIND IN THE PLANT EMBODYING HIS IDEAS THE FORCES OF MOMENTUM AND GRAVITY STEADILY IN HARNESS AND KEEPING THE TRACES TAUT

MUCH MORE OF SIMILAR NATURE TO THE ABOVE COULD BE QUOTED FROM OTHER ARTICLES PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE BUT THE FOREGOING WILL SERVE AS INSTANCES GENERALLY REPRESENTING ALL
EDISON NARRATES TWO INCIDENTS THAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CHARACTERISTIC OF A GOOD DEAL THAT HAD TO BE CONTENDED WITH COMING IN THE SHAPE OF NEFARIOUS ATTACK
THE TABLE IS USUALLY PRETTY WELL FILLED WITH SPECIMENS OR DATA OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUT THERE FOR HIS EXAMINATION
ABOUT 1860 REIS BUILT SEVERAL FORMS OF ELECTRICAL TELEPHONIC APPARATUS ALL IMITATING IN SOME DEGREE THE HUMAN EAR WITH ITS AUDITORY TUBE TYMPANUM ETC AND EXAMPLES OF THE APPARATUS WERE EXHIBITED IN PUBLIC NOT ONLY IN GERMANY BUT IN ENGLAND
IT WAS SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE HE COULD CONVEY ONE HUNDRED AMPERES BY MEANS OF SUCH CONTACTS BUT HE WORKED OUT AT LAST A SATISFACTORY DEVICE WHICH WAS EQUAL TO THE TASK
NO PERSON IN ANY CLASS IN WHICH YOU WERE AN EXHIBITOR RECEIVED A LIKE REWARD NOR WAS THIS ALL
CURVES ON MOTORS
JACK EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD JUST COME IN WITH A PARTY WHICH HAD BEEN HUNTING AND THAT HE FELT FINE
EVEN WHEN SUBSTANTIALLY INSTANTANEOUS PHOTOGRAPHS WERE EVOLVED AT A SOMEWHAT LATER DATE THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE USE OF WET PLATES WHICH HAVE TO BE PREPARED BY THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND USED IMMEDIATELY AND WERE THEREFORE QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR ANY PRACTICAL COMMERCIAL SCHEME
WITH THOSE EIGHT DYNAMOS WE HAD FOUR BELTS BETWEEN EACH ENGINE AND THE DYNAMO
AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLEW HOW TO DO IT
HE HAD INVESTIGATED ALL THE CRUSHING-MACHINES ON THE MARKET AND TRIED ALL HE COULD GET

THIS TOY IN TURN WAS THE FORERUNNER OF THE ZOETROPE OR SO-CALLED WHEEL OF LIFE WHICH WAS INTRODUCED INTO THIS COUNTRY ABOUT THE YEAR 1845
POPE WAS ALREADY ACTIVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION MR CALLAHAN WITH READY WIT TRANSFORMED HIS INDICATOR INTO A TICKER THAT WOULD MAKE A PRINTED RECORD

HE CERTAINLY HAD ONE TRAIT THAT ALL MEN MUST HAVE WHO WANT TO SUCCEED
JOHNSON F
AND THE SIZE OF SAFETY CATCH WIRE
I CONSIDERED THE EXPERIMENT A PERFECT FAILURE AND WHILE BEMOANING THE RESULTS OF THIS APPARENT FAILURE MR EDISON ENTERED AND AFTER LEARNING THE FACTS OF THE CASE CHEERFULLY REMARKED THAT I SHOULD NOT LOOK UPON IT AS A FAILURE FOR HE CONSIDERED EVERY EXPERIMENT A SUCCESS AS IN ALL CASES IT CLEARED UP THE ATMOSPHERE AND EVEN THOUGH IT FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH THE RESULTS SOUGHT FOR IT SHOULD PROVE A VALUABLE LESSON FOR GUIDANCE IN FUTURE WORK
MARCH 7 1873 141,777 RELAY MAGNETS
BETWEEN EIGHTY AND NINETY SEPARATE SUITS UPON EDISON'S FUNDAMENTAL LAMP AND DETAIL PATENTS WERE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND PROSECUTED TO COMPLETION
THE DATE OF THIS INTERESTING VISIT TO ANSONIA IS FIXED BY AN INSCRIPTION MADE BY EDISON ON A GLASS GOBLET WHICH HE USED
HOWEVER I GOT OUT OF THIS SCRAPE AND MANY TIMES AFTERWARD WHEN I CHANCED WITH OTHER OPERATORS TO MEET SOME OF THE YOUNG LADIES ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL THEY WOULD SMILE AND NOD MUCH TO THE MYSTIFICATION OF THE OPERATORS WHO WERE IGNORANT OF THIS EPISODE ANOTHER AMUSING STORY OF THIS PERIOD OF IMPECUNIOSITY AND FINANCIAL STRAIN IS TOLD THUS BY EDISON
THERE WERE OVER TWENTY KENO-ROOMS RUNNING
WHEN THE WAGON APPROACHED THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN I WAS MET BY A LARGE CROWD

METHOD OF OBTAINING ELECTRICITY DIRECT FROM COAL
AND SAFEGUARDING THE LAMPS AGAINST RUPTURE BY SUDDEN AND VIOLENT FLUCTUATIONS OF CURRENT
THE STORAGE BATTERY AS A COMMERCIAL ARTICLE WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE MARKET IN THE YEAR 1881
TO AN ORDINARY PERSON THE MERE SIGHT OF SUCH A TUBE WOULD HAVE BEEN AS DISTASTEFUL CERTAINLY AFTER A WEEK OR SO AS THE SMELL OF A QUAIL TO A MAN STRIVING TO EAT ONE EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH NEAR THE END OF HIS GASTRONOMIC ORDEAL
IF A CONCENTRATING MILL PLANNED TO TREAT FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND TONS PER DAY WERE TO BE OPERATED ON THIS BASIS THE INVESTMENT IN CRUSHERS AND THE SUPPLY OF POWER WOULD BE ENORMOUS TO SAY NOTHING OF THE RISK OF FREQUENT BREAKDOWNS BY REASON OF MULTIPLICITY OF MACHINERY AND PARTS
IT WOULD BE BUT REPETITION TO ENUMERATE HERE THE PRACTICAL RESULTS OF THE LABORATORY WORK DURING THE PAST TWO DECADES AS THEY APPEAR ON OTHER PAGES OF THIS WORK
INTEREST AND 15 PER CENT
EDISON'S REMARKS SHED A VIVID SIDE-LIGHT ON THIS EXTRAORDINARY EPISODE

INASMUCH AS A SUCCESSION OF SUCH IMPULSES COMING OVER THE LINE OWED THEIR ORIGIN TO THE PERFORATIONS IN THE TRANSMITTING TAPE IT FOLLOWED THAT THE RESULTING MARKS UPON THE RECEIVING TAPE WOULD CORRESPOND THERETO IN THEIR RESPECTIVE LENGTHS
NOW MR UPTON WAS A VERY ABLE MATHEMATICIAN WHO AFTER HE FINISHED HIS STUDIES AT PRINCETON WENT TO GERMANY AND GOT HIS FINAL GLOSS UNDER THAT GREAT MASTER HELMHOLTZ
WHEN I WAS STRUGGLING ALONG WITH THE IRON-ORE CONCENTRATION I WENT TO SEE SEVERAL BLAST-FURNACE MEN TO SELL THE ORE AT THE MARKET PRICE
THE NIGHT WAS DARK AND I FELL INTO A CULVERT AND WAS KNOCKED SENSELESS OWING TO THE VIGILANCE OF THE TWO ENGINEERS ON THE LOCOMOTIVES WHO SAW EACH OTHER APPROACHING ON THE STRAIGHT SINGLE TRACK NOTHING MORE DREADFUL HAPPENED THAN A SUMMONS TO THE THOUGHTLESS OPERATOR TO APPEAR BEFORE THE GENERAL MANAGER AT TORONTO
A CAVEAT IS ESSENTIALLY A NOTICE FILED BY AN INVENTOR ENTITLING HIM TO RECEIVE WARNING FROM THE OFFICE OF ANY APPLICATION FOR A PATENT FOR AN INVENTION THAT WOULD INTERFERE WITH HIS OWN DURING THE YEAR WHILE HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE PERFECTING HIS DEVICE
CRAIG ONE OF THE EARLY ORGANIZERS OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS BECAME INTERESTED IN THIS COMPANY WHOSE PRESIDENT WAS MR GEORGE HARRINGTON FORMERLY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES TREASURY
MORSE HAD TRIED THAT AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF ELECTRICAL APPLICATION IN TELEGRAPHY AND ALL AGREED THAT RENEWALS OF THE EXPERIMENT WERE AT ONCE COSTLY AND FOOLISH
AN IMPROVED AND EXTENDED STRING TELEPHONE
HE CAME ON GOT THE BATTERY TO LIVERPOOL SET UP AND READY JUST TWO HOURS BEFORE THE TEST COMMENCED
BEST TO-NIGHT SO FAR
I HAD EXPECTED TO FIND A MAN OF DISTINCTION
THE SOLDIERS HAD AWAKENED MY FATHER AND THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR ME WITH CANDLES AND LANTERNS

BUT IT GAINS IMMENSELY IN INTEREST WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT IT SUCCEEDED IN ITS SCIENTIFIC PURPOSE
WHEN I WAS A BOY HE SAYS THE PRINCE OF WALES THE LATE KING EDWARD CAME TO CANADA 1860 GREAT PREPARATIONS WERE MADE AT SARNIA THE CANADIAN TOWN OPPOSITE PORT HURON
DUPLICATE RECORDS IN ANY QUANTITY MAY NOW BE MADE FROM THIS MOLD BY SURROUNDING IT WITH A COLD-WATER JACKET AND DIPPING IT IN A MOLTEN WAX-LIKE MATERIAL
AT THIS TIME THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE ORANGE LABORATORY WERE DISTINCTLY RURAL IN CHARACTER
EDISON ALWAYS STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH HIS ASSOCIATES BUT NO ONE EVER QUESTIONED THE LEADERSHIP NOR WAS IT EVER IN DOUBT WHERE THE INSPIRATION ORIGINATED
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FAVORABLE DECISION ON THE INCANDESCENT LAMP FILAMENT PATENT COMING SO LATE HOWEVER THAT BUT LITTLE PRACTICAL GOOD WAS ACCOMPLISHED THE READER MAY SEARCH THE LAW-BOOKS IN VAIN FOR A SINGLE DECISION SQUARELY AND FAIRLY SUSTAINING A SINGLE PATENT OF FIRST ORDER
AS ONE OF THE LEADING ENGLISH PAPERS SAID AT THE TIME WITH EQUAL HUMOR AND TRUTH
THIS MEANT READY MADE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ANALOGOUS TO ILLUMINATION BY GAS WITH A NETWORK OF CONDUCTORS ALL CONNECTED TOGETHER SO THAT IN ANY GIVEN CITY AREA THE LIGHTS COULD BE FED WITH ELECTRICITY FROM SEVERAL DIRECTIONS THUS ELIMINATING ANY INTERRUPTION DUE TO THE DISTURBANCE ON ANY PARTICULAR SECTION

OUTSIDE OF MENLO PARK THIS WAS THE FIRST REGULAR STATION FOR INCANDESCENT LIGHTING IN THE WORLD AS THE PEARL STREET STATION IN NEW YORK DID NOT GO INTO OPERATION UNTIL SEPTEMBER OF THE SAME YEAR
IN THE JAIL ALSO WAS A HALF-BREED HORSE-THIEF
JULY 15 1886 438,307 MANUFACTURE OF INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
THIS NEW PLANT TAKES HIGH-TENSION POLYPHASE CURRENT FROM A WATER-POWER THIRTY OR FORTY MILES AWAY AT PADERNO ON THE RIVER ADDA FLOWING FROM THE APENNINES
THIS GREAT EXCESS OF POWER WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE LATTER CAME FROM THE PERSON TURNING THE HANDLE
THE AMOUNT OF ORE DISCLOSED BY THIS SURVEY WAS SIMPLY FABULOUS
PRETTY GOOD
A SINGLE APPARATUS IS THEREFORE USED AT EACH END PERFORMING THE DOUBLE FUNCTION OF TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER
IT HAS BEEN OUT EVER SINCE
HAVING OBTAINED ALL THE DATA AND INVESTIGATED GAS-JET DISTRIBUTION IN NEW YORK BY ACTUAL OBSERVATIONS I MADE UP MY MIND THAT THE PROBLEM OF THE SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT COULD BE SOLVED AND MADE COMMERCIAL ABOUT THE END OF AUGUST 1878 HE BEGAN HIS SECOND ORGANIZED ATTACK ON THE SUBDIVISION OF THE CURRENT WHICH WAS STEADILY MAINTAINED UNTIL HE ACHIEVED SIGNAL VICTORY A YEAR AND TWO MONTHS LATER
YOU HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
THE PERFORATED STRIPS WERE PREPARED IN THIRTY MINUTES BY TEN PERSONS AND DUPLICATED BY NINE COPYISTS
EXPERIMENT WAS CONTINUED BEYOND THE POINT OF PERADVENTURE AND AFTER SOME NEW MACHINERY HAD BEEN BUILT THE MANUFACTURE OF THE NEW TYPE OF CELL WAS BEGUN IN THE EARLY SUMMER OF 1909 AND AT THE PRESENT WRITING IS BEING EXTENDED AS FAST AS THE NECESSARY ADDITIONAL MACHINERY CAN BE MADE
THAT PRETTY LITTLE VILLAGE OFFERED AT THE MOMENT MANY ATTRACTIONS AS A POSSIBLE CHICAGO
THIS WAS ONE OF THE BIG BOX HOUSES ON UPPER FIFTH AVENUE
HE STILL CONTINUES TO PLY HIS CRAFT WITH UNABATED SKILL AND OVERSEES THE WORK OF THE MECHANICS AS HIS PRODUCTIONS ARE WROUGHT INTO CONCRETE SHAPE
SUCH WAS THE GENERAL TYPE OF PHONOGRAPH USED FOR EXHIBITION PURPOSES IN AMERICA AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE THREE OR FOUR YEARS IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDING THE DATE OF THIS INVENTION
31 1877 203,013 SPEAKING TELEGRAPH DEC
STILL ANOTHER OF THE OTT FAMILY THE SON OF JOHN F FOR SOME YEARS PAST HAS BEEN ON THE EXPERIMENTAL STAFF OF THE ORANGE LABORATORY
I ONCE MADE AN EXPERIMENT IN EDISON'S LABORATORY AT MENLO PARK DURING THE LATTER PART OF 1880 AND THE RESULTS WERE NOT AS LOOKED FOR
IT WAS CAPABLE OF LIGHTING TWELVE HUNDRED INCANDESCENT LAMPS AND WEIGHED WITH ITS ENGINE TWENTY-SEVEN TONS THE ARMATURE ALONE WEIGHING SIX TONS
DISSENSIONS AROSE BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FIELD AND EDISON INTERESTS AND IN APRIL 1890 THE RAILWAY COMPANY ASSIGNED ITS RIGHTS TO THE EDISON PATENTS TO THE EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY RECENTLY FORMED BY THE CONSOLIDATION OF ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE EDISON LIGHT POWER AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY UNDER ONE MANAGEMENT

AND EACH LIGHT TO BE INDEPENDENT OF ALL THE OTHERS IN REGARD TO ITS OPERATION AND EXTINGUISHMENT
BUT IN 1895 THE FILMS WERE APPLIED TO MODIFIED FORMS OF MAGIC LANTERNS BY WHICH THE IMAGES ARE PROJECTED UPON A SCREEN
HIS ANSWER WAS THAT THE AIR-SPACES CONSTITUTED THE VALUE OF HIS PLAN AS THE PARTICLES OF GRAPHITE FALLING INTO THEM WOULD BE THROWN OUT BY THE ACTION OF CENTRIFUGAL FORCE AS THE COMMUTATOR REVOLVED

LATER ON WE BECAME GOOD FRIENDS
THERE WERE PARTIES WHO WANTED TO KNOW IF TRANSPORTATION OVER THE MULE ROUTE COULD NOT BE DONE BY ELECTRICITY
THE YOUTHFUL PROPRIETOR SOMETIMES CLEARED AS MUCH AS TWENTY TO THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH FROM THIS UNIQUE JOURNALISTIC ENTERPRISE
BUT THE READER HAS ALREADY LEARNED FROM THE PRECEDING NARRATIVE THAT PRIOR TO ITS INVENTION BY EDISON SUCH A DEVICE WAS NOT OBVIOUS EVEN TO THE MOST HIGHLY TRAINED EXPERTS OF THE WORLD AT THAT PERIOD
THE REAL TRUTH IS THAT EDISON HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO CEASELESSLY FERTILE OF IDEAS HIMSELF HE HAS HAD MORE THAN HIS WHOLE STAFF COULD EVER DO TO TRY THEM ALL OUT
CLOSE TO THE MENLO PARK RAILWAY STATION IS A GROUP OF GAUNT AND DESERTED BUILDINGS SHELTER OF THE CASUAL TRAMP AND SLOWLY CRUMBLING AWAY WHEN NOT DESTROYED BY THE CARELESSNESS OF SOME RAGGED SMOKER
FOUR SENDING AND FOUR RECEIVING OPERATORS ARE KEPT BUSY AT EACH END OR EIGHT IN ALL
HIS SENSE OF HUMOR IS INTENSE BUT NOT OF THE HOTHOUSE OVERDEVELOPED VARIETY
IT WAS THERE THAT HE PERFECTED THE PECULIAR VERTICAL STYLE OF WRITING WHICH BEGINNING WITH HIM IN TELEGRAPHY LATER BECAME SO MUCH OF A FAD WITH TEACHERS OF PENMANSHIP AND IN THE SCHOOLS
IN THOSE DAYS THE TELEGRAPH FRATERNITY WAS RATHER DEMORALIZED AND THE DISCIPLINE WAS VERY LAX
IT COST ME TOO MUCH MONEY TO MAINTAIN AND I SOLD IT TO GARDINER HUBBARD THE FATHER-IN-LAW OF ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL
HOWEVER ABOUT 3 P
SIXTY MEN WERE PUT ON TOP OF THE DYNAMO TO GET IT READY AND EACH MAN HAD WRITTEN ORDERS AS TO WHAT HE WAS TO PERFORM
I INVITED THEM IN TAKING THEM FIRST TO THE BOILER-ROOM WHERE I SHOWED THEM THE COAL-PILE EXPLAINING THAT THIS WAS USED TO GENERATE STEAM IN THE BOILER
THIS LEVER IS ACTUATED THROUGH THE AGENCY OF TWO SMALL PINS CARRIED BY AN ARM PROJECTING FROM THE PRESS-LEVER PL
EDISON THAT IN DISCUSSING ANY PROJECT OR NEW IDEA HIS FIRST IMPULSE IS TO TAKE UP ANY PIECE OF PAPER AVAILABLE AND MAKE DRAWINGS OF IT
IT IS DIFFICULT AT ANY TIME TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF ANY SINGLE INVENTION AND THE INVESTIGATION BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT WHERE INVENTIONS OF THE FIRST CLASS HAVE BEEN CROWDED UPON EACH OTHER IN RAPID AND BEWILDERING SUCCESSION
25 1881 251,559 ELECTRICAL DROP LIGHT
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF WEATHER ONE SIDE OF THE QUADRUPLEX WOULD WORK VERY SHAKILY AND I HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN ASCERTAINING THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE
HALF AN HOUR OF SLEEP THREE OR FOUR TIMES IN THE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS WAS ALL HE NEEDED IN THOSE DAYS WHEN ONE INVENTION SUCCEEDED ANOTHER WITH DAZZLING RAPIDITY AND WHEN HE WORKED WITH THE FIERCE ERUPTIVE ENERGY OF A GREAT VOLCANO THROWING OUT NEW IDEAS INCESSANTLY WITH SPECTACULAR EFFECT ON THE ARTS TO WHICH THEY RELATED
THIS INVENTION THEREFORE MARKED THE VERY BEGINNING OF AN ENTIRELY NEW ART WHICH WITH THE NEW INDUSTRIES ATTENDANT UPON ITS DEVELOPMENT HAS SINCE GROWN TO OCCUPY A POSITION OF WORLDWIDE REPUTATION
THE ENGINES AND DYNAMOS MADE A HORRIBLE RACKET FROM LOUD AND DEEP GROANS TO A HIDEOUS SHRIEK AND THE PLACE SEEMED TO BE FILLED WITH SPARKS AND FLAMES OF ALL COLORS
AND THESE WERE COPIED AND PASTED UP ON THE BULLETIN-BOARD
VARIOUS ANALOGIES NEXT POINTED TO THE USE OF HEAT AND THE THERMOELECTRIC CELL EMERGED EMBODYING THE APPLICATION OF FLAME TO THE JUNCTION OF TWO DIFFERENT METALS
CURVES WERE MODIFIED AND GRADES ELIMINATED WHERE POSSIBLE BY THE ERECTION OF NUMEROUS TRESTLES
HE DID SO VERY CONSCIENTIOUSLY AND IT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE FOR HE WAS KEPT BUSY ANSWERING MR EDISON'S NUMEROUS QUESTIONS
THIS DEPARTMENT WAS ORGANIZED IN 1889 BY MAJOR EATON WHO WAS AT THIS TIME AND FOR SOME YEARS AFTERWARD ITS GENERAL COUNSEL
THE FIRST INTENTION WAS TO COVER A DISTRICT EXTENDING FROM CANAL STREET ON THE NORTH TO WALL STREET ON THE SOUTH
REIFF THEN EASTERN BOND AGENT FOR THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD
BUT HE WAS WITHOUT MONEY TO OBTAIN IT
HE MEETS OBSTRUCTION WITH THE KEEN DELIGHT OF A STRONG MAN BATTLING WITH THE WAVES AND OPPOSING THEM IN SHEER ENJOYMENT AND THE GREATER AND MORE APPARENTLY OVERWHELMING THE FORCES THAT MAY TEND TO SWEEP HIM BACK THE MORE VIGOROUS HIS OWN EFFORTS TO FORGE THROUGH THEM
FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE READER IN REFERRING TO FIG
A SUDDEN BLACK CLOUD CAME UP AND I TELEPHONED TO CHINNOCK AND ASKED HIM ABOUT THE LOAD
AS THE TERM OF THE PATENT HAD BEEN LIMITED UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE CERTAIN FOREIGN PATENTS HAD BEEN ISSUED TO EDISON BEFORE THAT IN THIS COUNTRY THERE WAS NOW BUT A SHORT TIME LEFT FOR ENJOYMENT OF THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE STATUTE AND GRANTED TO EDISON AND HIS ASSIGNS BY THE TERMS OF THE PATENT ITSELF
PART OF THIS DEVELOPMENT MAY BE DUE TO THE INVENTIVE SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGINAL INVENTOR AND HIS ASSOCIATES WHO BY REASON OF PRIOR INVESTIGATION WOULD BE IN BETTER POSITION TO FOLLOW UP THE ART IN ITS EARLIEST DETAILS THAN OTHERS WHO MIGHT BE REGARDED AS MERE OUTSIDERS
SINCE CAPITAL IS TIMID I WILL RAISE AND SUPPLY IT
16 1877 420,594 QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPH AUG
IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE PHONOGRAPH
THE INSTALLATION WAS MOST SUCCESSFUL
THIS DIDN'T PAY SO HE STARTED A RESTAURANT IN PERNAMBUCO BRAZIL
IT IS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT HENRY GOEBEL CONSTRUCTED A PRACTICAL INCANDESCENT LAMP IN 1854
THEN I CAME IN WITH CRACKED HICKORY NUTS THEN POP-CORN BALLS AND FINALLY MOLASSES CANDY
IN HIS OWN COUNTRY HE HAS WON THE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION OF MILLIONS

BEST OF ALL HE WAS ENTERPRISING ONE OF THE LEADERS AND PIONEERS FOR WHOM THE WORLD IS ALWAYS LOOKING
IN PERUSING CHAPTER X OF THE FOREGOING NARRATIVE THE READER UNDOUBTEDLY NOTED EDISON'S CLEAR APPREHENSION OF THE PRACTICAL USES OF THE PHONOGRAPH AS EVIDENCED BY HIS PROPHETIC UTTERANCES IN THE ARTICLE WRITTEN BY HIM FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW IN JUNE 1878
A COLLECTION OF UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN PATENTS EMBRACING SOME HUNDREDS OF VOLUMES TOGETHER WITH AN EXTENSIVE ASSORTMENT OF MISCELLANEOUS BOOKS OF SPECIAL AND GENERAL INTEREST
THE TRADITIONS OF THE LABORATORY INCLUDE COTS PLACED IN MANY OF THE ROOMS OF THESE UPPER FLOORS BUT THAT WAS IN THE EARLIER YEARS WHEN THE STRENUOUS SCENES OF MENLO PARK WERE REPEATED IN THE NEW QUARTERS
TO SPEAK PLAINLY THE ELECTRIC IMPULSES CORRESPOND IN FORM AND CHARACTER TO THE SOUND VIBRATION WHICH THEY REPRESENT
THUS IT WILL BE SEEN BY ANOTHER CLEVER JUGGLE WITH THE WILLING AGENT CARBON FOR WHICH HE HAS FOUND SO MANY DUTIES EDISON IS ABLE TO TRANSFER OR TRANSMIT EXACTLY TO THE LOCAL CIRCUIT THE MAIN-LINE CURRENT IN ALL ITS MINUTEST VARIATIONS
THREE OTHERS BETWEEN 8 AND 10 PER CENT
THIS CURRENT FLOWING AROUND THE RECEIVING MAGNET CAUSES CORRESPONDING IMPULSES THEREIN WHICH ACTING UPON ITS DIAPHRAGM EFFECT A REPRODUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL VIBRATIONS AND HENCE OF THE ORIGINAL SOUNDS
EDISON SAID THAT AS THE RESULT OF THE TIME CONSUMED AND THE EXERCISE IN WALKING WHILE HE FOUND HIS FRIEND HE WAS EXTREMELY HUNGRY AND THAT HE GAVE MOST SERIOUS CONSIDERATION AS TO WHAT HE SHOULD BUY IN THE WAY OF FOOD AND WHAT PARTICULAR KIND OF FOOD WOULD BE MOST SATISFYING AND FILLING
AS TO THE STATE OF MR EDISON'S MIND WHEN THE FINAL DECISION WAS REACHED TO CLOSE DOWN IF HE WAS SPECIALLY DISAPPOINTED THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS MANNER TO INDICATE IT HIS EVERY THOUGHT BEING FOR THE FUTURE AND AS TO WHAT COULD BE DONE TO PULL US OUT OF THE FINANCIAL SITUATION IN WHICH WE FOUND OURSELVES AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH WE HAD ACQUIRED AT SO GREAT A COST IT WILL HAVE BEEN GATHERED THAT THE FUNDS FOR THIS GREAT EXPERIMENT WERE FURNISHED LARGELY BY EDISON
2 THE GALVANOMETER IS SHOWN AT B IN THE BRIDGE WIRE AND AT C D AND E THERE ARE SHOWN THE RESISTANCES IN THE OTHER ARMS OF THE BRIDGE WHICH ARE ADJUSTED TO EQUAL THE RESISTANCE OF THE TASIMETER CIRCUIT
THEN CAME THE CARBON TELEPHONE TRANSMITTER A LARGE NUMBER OF WHICH WERE MADE BY BERGMANN FOR THE WESTERN UNION
JUNE 27 1884 391,595 SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING
WHEN EDISON HAD FINISHED EXPLAINING THE PRINCIPLES AND DETAILS OF THE LAMP HE ASKED KRUESI TO LET THE DYNAMO MACHINE RUN
PERHAPS HE IS NOT WHOLLY RESPONSIBLE PERSONALLY FOR THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS
ARRANGEMENTS TO THIS END WERE ACCORDINGLY MADE WITH A JAPANESE FARMER WHO BEGAN TO MAKE IMMEDIATE SHIPMENTS AND WHO SUBSEQUENTLY DISPLAYED SO MUCH INGENUITY IN FERTILIZING AND CROSS-FERTILIZING THAT THE HOMOGENEITY OF THE PRODUCT WAS CONSTANTLY IMPROVED
I REMOVED THEM ALL AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL OUNCES
THEY ARE SPECIFIED IN THE LIST OF PATENTS FOLLOWING THIS APPENDIX AND MAY BE EXAMINED IN DETAIL BY ANY INTERESTED STUDENT
THE TRAIN RUNNING ONE DAY AT THIRTY MILES AN HOUR OVER A PIECE OF POORLY LAID TRACK WAS THROWN SUDDENLY OUT OF THE PERPENDICULAR WITH A VIOLENT LURCH AND BEFORE EDISON COULD CATCH IT A STICK OF PHOSPHORUS WAS JARRED FROM ITS SHELF FELL TO THE FLOOR AND BURST INTO FLAME
I CARRIED OUT THIS IDEA AND MADE EVERY MAN TAKE A DOSE EVERY DAY BUT THERE WAS GREAT OPPOSITION AND HOT MERCURY WAS FINALLY ABANDONED IT WILL HAVE BEEN GATHERED THAT EDISON HAS OWED HIS SPECIAL IMMUNITY FROM OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES NOT ONLY TO LUCK BUT TO UNUSUAL POWERS OF ENDURANCE AND A STRONG PHYSIQUE INHERITED NO DOUBT FROM HIS FATHER
DAVENPORT WAS ALSO THE FIRST MAN TO APPLY ELECTRIC POWER TO THE PRINTING-PRESS IN 1840
AND THAT WHICH HE DID WITH SLOW CAREFUL SCRUTINY SIX MONTHS AGO HE WILL BE DOING WITH JUST AS MUCH CALM DELIBERATION OF RESEARCH SIX MONTHS HENCE--AND SIX YEARS HENCE IF NECESSARY

DEXTRINE 10 LBS
AT THE GENERATING STATION AT MENLO PARK FOUR Z DYNAMOS OF 110 VOLTS WERE USED CONNECTED TWO IN SERIES IN MULTIPLE ARC GIVING A LINE VOLTAGE OF 220
THE TWO PLATES AND THE CARBON BUTTON FORM PART OF AN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT CONTAINING A BATTERY AND A GALVANOMETER
THE EXHIBITION CONTINUED TILL ABOUT 12.30 A.M WHEN MRS HAYES AND SEVERAL OTHER LADIES WHO HAD BEEN INDUCED TO GET UP AND DRESS APPEARED
AND THAT WITH AN EXPENDITURE FOR COAL PROPORTIONATELY EQUAL TO ABOUT 29 TO 33 PER CENT
CHAPTER XVI THE FIRST EDISON CENTRAL STATION A NOTED INVENTOR ONCE SAID AT THE END OF A LIFETIME OF FIGHTING TO DEFEND HIS RIGHTS THAT HE FOUND THERE WERE THREE STAGES IN ALL GREAT INVENTIONS
24 1886 379,944 COMMUTATOR FOR DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINESNOV
IN OBTAINING THIS PERFECTION OF VACUUM APPARATUS EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WAS APPROACHING MUCH NEARER TO A SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM
SEND A MAN RIGHT UP TO PUT IT OUT AFTER THE STATION HAD BEEN RUNNING SEVERAL MONTHS AND WAS TECHNICALLY A SUCCESS WE BEGAN TO LOOK AFTER THE FINANCIAL PART
THESE PHENOMENA ARE EASY OF COMPREHENSION AND DEMONSTRATION
IN THE COURSE OF HIS ARTICLE HE MENTIONS THE CURIOUS FACT THAT DOCTOR LAWS AT FIRST IN RECEIVING QUOTATIONS FROM THE EXCHANGES WAS SO DISTRUSTFUL OF THE MORSE SYSTEM THAT HE INSTALLED LONG LINES OF SPEAKING-TUBE AS A MORE SATISFACTORY AND SAFE DEVICE THAN A TELEGRAPH WIRE
21 1880 248,437 APPARATUS FOR TREATING CARBONS FOR ELECTRIC LAMPS DEC
AND SEVERAL OF HIS EARLIEST DETAIL LIGHTING INVENTIONS DEAL WITH THIS SUBJECT
IT IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE EDISON WORKING OUT THE PHONOGRAPH TELEPHONE AND INCANDESCENT LAMP UNDER THE TROPICAL CLIMES HE SOUGHT
THUS ONE MAY FOLLOW THE INVESTIGATION THROUGH A MAZE OF EXPERIMENTS WHICH LED UP TO THE SUCCESSFUL INVENTION OF THE CARBON BUTTON TRANSMITTER THE VITAL DEVICE TO GIVE THE TELEPHONE ITS NEEDED ARTICULATION AND PERFECTION
I HAVEN'T ENOUGH TO GO AROUND I SOLD ALL OUT AND MADE WHAT TO ME THEN WAS AN IMMENSE SUM OF MONEY SUCH EPISODES AS THIS ADDED MATERIALLY TO HIS INCOME BUT DID NOT NECESSARILY INCREASE HIS SAVINGS FOR HE WAS THEN AS NOW AN UTTER SPENDTHRIFT SO LONG AS SOME NEW APPARATUS OR SUPPLIES FOR EXPERIMENT COULD BE HAD
HIS GENIUS AS AN INVENTOR IS REVEALED IN MANY DETAILS OF THE GREAT CONCENTRATING PLANT
OVER 1500 MEN WERE FINALLY EMPLOYED
26 1887 563,462 METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR DRAWING WIRE OCT
HE WAS ONLY FORTY IN 1887 AND ALL THAT HE HAD DONE UP TO THAT TIME TREMENDOUS AS MUCH OF IT WAS HAD WORN A HAPHAZARD BOHEMIAN AIR WITH ALL THE INCONSEQUENTIAL FREEDOM AND CRUDENESS SOMEHOW ATTACHING TO PIONEER LIFE
BRIEFLY DESCRIBED IN OUTLINE THE TRAIN TELEGRAPH SYSTEM CONSISTED OF AN INDUCTION CIRCUIT OBTAINED BY LAYING STRIPS OF METAL ALONG THE TOP OR ROOF OF A RAILWAY-CAR AND THE INSTALLATION OF A SPECIAL TELEGRAPH LINE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE TRACK AND STRUNG ON POLES OF ONLY MEDIUM HEIGHT
FOOTNOTE 23
AS NOTED ALREADY THE LATTER PART OF EACH WINTER IS SPENT AT FORT MYERS FLORIDA WHERE EDISON HAS ON THE BANKS OF THE CALAHOUTCHIE RIVER A PLANTATION HOME THAT IS IN MANY WAYS A MINIATURE COPY OF THE HOME AND LABORATORY UP NORTH
AUG 10 1904 861,242 CAN OR RECEPTACLE FOR STORAGE BATTERY
DEVICE AFTER DEVICE RELATING TO SOME PART OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED BUILT AND TRIED ONLY TO BE REJECTED RUTHLESSLY AS BEING UNSUITABLE
BY MEANS OF FREQUENT REPORTS AIDED BY HIS REMARKABLE MEMORY HE KEEPS IN AS CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE PLANT AS IF HE WERE THERE IN PERSON EVERY DAY AND IS THUS ENABLED TO SUGGEST IMPROVEMENT IN ANY PARTICULAR DETAIL
IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER IT OFTEN GOES THERE
AT ONE TIME INDEED THESE MEN WERE SO NUMEROUS AND SO MUCH IN EVIDENCE AS TO CONSTITUTE A TYPE THAT THE PUBLIC WAS DISPOSED TO ACCEPT AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TELEGRAPHIC FRATERNITY
HUBBARD FATHER-IN-LAW OF ALEX
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE AFTER SEEING HOW QUICKLY AND PERFECTLY IT WORKED SAID
AND ALTHOUGH THAT CAPACITY SO FAR AS PHONOGRAPHS IS CONCERNED HAS ACTUALLY REACHED AN OUTPUT OF OVER 6000 COMPLETE PHONOGRAPHS PER WEEK AND UPWARD OF 130,000 MOLDED RECORDS PER DAY--WITH A PAY-ROLL EMBRACING OVER 3500 EMPLOYEES INCLUDING OFFICE FORCE--AND AMOUNTING TO ABOUT $45,000 PER WEEK--THE LIMITS OF PRODUCTION HAVE NOT YET BEEN REACHED
WE HAVE SOME IDEA HOW THE ANCIENTS LOOKED AND FELT AND WROTE
IT WAS AT THE PORT HURON PUBLIC SCHOOL THAT EDISON RECEIVED ALL THE REGULAR SCHOLASTIC INSTRUCTION HE EVER ENJOYED--JUST THREE MONTHS
THE VARIOUS INTERESTS WERE COMBINED IN A CORPORATION UNDER WHOSE AUSPICES THE SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED ON THE LEHIGH VALLEY RAILROAD WHERE IT WAS USED FOR SEVERAL YEARS
28 1904 813,490 CEMENT KILN
IN BOTH RESPECTS FOR THESE FORTY YEARS EDISON HAS BEEN A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SENTIMENT OF HERO-WORSHIP CAN MANIFEST ITSELF AND OF THE DEEP DESIRE OF CURIOSITY TO GET SATISFACTION BY PERSONAL OBSERVATION OR CONTACT
IN SOME MANNER PRESIDENT GRANT WAS PERSUADED THAT GENERAL CONDITIONS AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE CROPS WOULD BE HELPED IF THE SALE OF GOLD WERE SUSPENDED FOR A TIME
HE WOULD RUE THE DAY WHEN HE PUT THE CABLE IN IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE PROPHECY WAS FULFILLED FOR THE CABLE WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE FRIGHTFUL FINANCIAL COLLAPSE OF THE SYSTEM AND WAS TORN OUT IN A FEW YEARS TO MAKE WAY FOR THE TRIUMPHANT TROLLEY IN THE SLOT INCIDENTAL GLIMPSES OF THIS WORK ARE BOTH AMUSING AND INTERESTING
IN THE VIEWS OF HURDLE-LEAPING THE SIMULATION WAS STILL MORE ADMIRABLE EVEN TO THE MOTION OF THE TAIL AS THE ANIMAL GATHERED FOR THE JUMP THE RAISING OF HIS HEAD ALL WERE THERE
WHEN THE MOLDS ARE TAKEN AWAY AN ENTIRE HOUSE IS DISCLOSED CAST IN ONE PIECE FROM CELLAR TO TIP OF ROOF COMPLETE WITH FLOORS INTERIOR WALLS STAIRWAYS BATH AND LAUNDRY TUBS ELECTRIC-WIRE CONDUITS GAS WATER AND HEATING PIPES
NOT THAT HE TAKES IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE CONCLUSIONS ARE CORRECT FOR HE FREQUENTLY OBTAINS VASTLY DIFFERENT RESULTS BY REPEATING IN HIS OWN WAY EXPERIMENTS MADE BY OTHERS AS DETAILED IN BOOKS
WE ARE NOW IN SIGHT OF THE REAL CONCENTRATES WHICH ARE CONVEYED TO DRYER NO
MAY 31 1877 452,913 SEXTUPLEX TELEGRAPH
ON THAT DATE AS WE HAVE SEEN IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER EDISON'S LABORS CULMINATED IN HIS INVENTION OF A PRACTICAL INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP EMBODYING ABSOLUTELY ALL THE ESSENTIALS OF THE LAMP OF TO-DAY THUS OPENING TO THE WORLD THE DOORS OF A NEW ART AND INDUSTRY
EVEN HAD THAT NOT BEEN SO THE INCLINATIONS OF THE BOY BARELY TEN YEARS OLD WERE TOWARD CHEMISTRY AND FIFTY YEARS LATER THERE IS SEEN NO CHANGE OF PREDILECTION
ACHESON MENTIONS IN HIS PERSONAL NOTES ON WORK AT THE LABORATORY THAT IN DECEMBER OF 1880 WHILE ON SOME EXPERIMENTAL WORK HE WAS CALLED TO THE NEW LAMP FACTORY STARTED RECENTLY AT MENLO PARK AND THERE FOUND EDISON JOHNSON BATCHELOR AND UPTON IN CONFERENCE AND EDISON INFORMED ME THAT MR BATCHELOR WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE CONSTRUCTION DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF THE LAMP FACTORY WAS SOON TO SAIL FOR EUROPE TO PREPARE FOR THE EXHIBIT TO BE MADE AT THE ELECTRICAL EXPOSITION TO BE HELD IN PARIS DURING THE COMING SUMMER THESE PREPARATIONS OVERLAP THE REINFORCEMENT OF THE STAFF WITH SOME NOTABLE ADDITIONS CHIEF AMONG THEM BEING MR SAMUEL INSULL WHOSE INTERESTING NARRATIVE OF EVENTS FITS ADMIRABLY INTO THE STORY AT THIS STAGE AND GIVES A VIVID IDEA OF THE INTENSE ACTIVITY AND EXCITEMENT WITH WHICH THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE AROUND EDISON WAS THEN SURCHARGED
ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND I WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING AROUND
HENRY E
THE THIRD EMBRACES A NUMBER OF PROJECTED INVENTIONS PARTIALLY COMPLETED INVESTIGATIONS INVENTIONS IN USE BUT NOT PATENTED AND A GREAT MANY CAVEATS FILED IN THE PATENT OFFICE AT VARIOUS TIMES DURING THE LAST FORTY YEARS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING HIS IDEAS PENDING THEIR CONTEMPLATED REALIZATION IN PRACTICE
THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
HIS START ON THIS LAMP AND AN EXPRESSED DESIRE TO HAVE IT MANUFACTURED FOR REGULAR USE FILLED EVEN SOME OF HIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATES WITH DISMAY FOR THEY COULD SEE NOTHING BUT DISASTER AHEAD IN FORCING SUCH A LAMP ON THE MARKET
DURING THIS PERIOD OF ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT EDISON WAS CONTINUOUSLY WORKING ON THE INVENTION AND COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION OF THE INCANDESCENT LAMP
WE USED TO GO OUT AT NIGHT TO A LITTLE LOW PLACE AN ALL-NIGHT HOUSE--EIGHT FEET WIDE AND TWENTY-TWO FEET LONG--WHERE WE GOT A LUNCH AT TWO OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
THE NEXT STEP CAME WITH THE CREATION OF THE GREAT GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY OF TO-DAY A COMBINATION OF THE EDISON THOMSON-HOUSTON AND BRUSH LIGHTING INTERESTS IN MANUFACTURE WHICH TO THIS DAY MAINTAINS THE EVER-GROWING PLANTS AT HARRISON LYNN AND SCHENECTADY AND THERE EMPLOYS FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE
I THEN HAD A STANDARD MADE TO HOLD ANOTHER OIL-CUP SO AS TO SEE AND REGULATE THE DROP-FEED
MAY 24 1890 484,584 PHONOGRAPH REPRODUCER
I WILL GIVE YOU $30,000 I SAID
SMALL WONDER THEN THAT AT THE END OF THESE WANDERINGS WHEN HE HAD FOUND A PLACE TO REST THE SOLE OF HIS FOOT HE ESTABLISHED A LABORATORY IN WHICH TO CARRY ON HIS RESEARCHES IN A MORE METHODICAL AND PRACTICAL MANNER
ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS THE LEGITIMATE OUTCOME OF A SERIES OF EXHAUSTIVE EXPERIMENTS FOUNDED UPON LOGICAL AND ORIGINAL REASONING IN A MIND THAT HAD THE COURAGE AND HARDIHOOD TO SET AT NAUGHT THE CONFIRMED OPINIONS OF THE WORLD VOICED BY THOSE GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE THE BEST EXPONENTS OF THE ART--EXPERIMENTS CARRIED ON AMID A STORM OF JEERS AND DERISION ALMOST AS CONTEMPTUOUS AS IF THE SEARCH WERE FOR THE DISCOVERY OF PERPETUAL MOTION
IT WAS HOWEVER AMONG SUCH CHARACTERS THAT EDISON WAS VERY LARGELY THROWN IN THESE EARLY DAYS OF AIMLESS DRIFTING TO LEARN SOMETHING PERHAPS OF THEIR NONCHALANT PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE SHARING BED AND BOARD WITH THEM UNDER ALL KINDS OF ADVERSE CONDITIONS BUT ALWAYS MAINTAINING A STOIC ABSTEMIOUSNESS AND NEVER FEELING OTHER THAN A KEEN REGRET AT THE WASTE OF SO MUCH GENUINE ABILITY AND KINDLINESS ON THE PART OF THOSE KNIGHTS ERRANT OF THE KEY WHOSE INEVITABLE FATE MIGHT SO EASILY HAVE BEEN HIS OWN
NEVER IS HE SO PREOCCUPIED OR FRETTED WITH CARES AS NOT TO DROP ALL THOUGHT OF HIS WORK FOR A FEW MOMENTS TO LISTEN TO A NEW STORY WITH A READY SMILE ALL THE WHILE AND A HEARTY BOYISH LAUGH AT THE END
OTHER MODELS EMPHASIZED THIS EXTRAORDINARY CONTRAST
WHEN EXPERIMENTING AT MENLO PARK WE HAD ALL THE WAY FROM FORTY TO FIFTY MEN
THE NATIONAL PHONOGRAPH COMPANY FROM THE VERY START DETERMINED TO RETIRE AT LEAST TEMPORARILY FROM THE FIELD OF STENOGRAPHIC USE AND TO EXPLOIT THE PHONOGRAPH FOR MUSICAL PURPOSES AS A COMPETITOR OF THE MUSIC-BOX
THEY WERE SITUATED ON GOERCK STREET NEW YORK NORTH OF GRAND STREET ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE CITY AND THERE VERY SOON AFTER WAS ESTABLISHED THE FIRST EDISON DYNAMO-MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENT KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AS THE EDISON MACHINE WORKS
CERTAINLY NOT MORE THAN 100
FOR MANY YEARS IT HAD BEEN A MUCH-DISCUSSED QUESTION HOW TO MAKE THESE ORES AVAILABLE FOR TRANSPORTATION TO DISTANT FURNACES
AT SEA FROM AN ELEVATION OF ONE HUNDRED FEET I CAN COMMUNICATE ELECTRICALLY A GREAT DISTANCE AND SINCE THIS ELEVATION OR ONE SUFFICIENTLY HIGH CAN BE HAD BY UTILIZING THE MASTS OF SHIPS SIGNALS CAN BE SENT AND RECEIVED BETWEEN SHIPS SEPARATED A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE AND BY REPEATING THE SIGNALS FROM SHIP TO SHIP COMMUNICATION CAN BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN POINTS AT ANY DISTANCE APART OR ACROSS THE LARGEST SEAS AND EVEN OCEANS
WITHOUT NOTICING EITHER OF US HE WENT UP TO THE STOVE AND KICKED IT OVER
19 1874 178,222 DUPLEX TELEGRAPHS
THOSE INTENDED FOR STAIRWAYS EAVES CORNICES WINDOWS DOORWAYS ETC ARE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED IN DESIGN ALTHOUGH THE SAME GENERAL PRINCIPLES ARE EMPLOYED IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION
THE GIGANTIC EXPANSION OF THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY WAS FORESHADOWED IN THE CHANGE FROM WOOD TO COAL IN THE SMELTING FURNACES
CHEEVER THE EMBRYONIC PHONOGRAPH AND THE CRUDE TELEPHONE SHARED ROOMS AND EXPENSES
AND IT IS DESIRED HERE TO MAKE GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO SUCH COLLABORATORS AS MESSRS
IT IS THUS ATTRACTED TOWARD AN ADJACENT ELECTROMAGNET WHEN COLD AND IS UNINFLUENCED WHEN HOT AND AS THE RESULT MOTION IS PRODUCED
OPTIMISTIC AND HOPEFUL TO A HIGH DEGREE EDISON HAS THE HAPPY FACULTY OF BEGINNING THE DAY AS OPEN-MINDED AS A CHILD--YESTERDAY'S DISAPPOINTMENTS AND FAILURES DISCARDED AND DISCOUNTED BY THE ALLURING POSSIBILITIES OF TO-MORROW
FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER THE DISTANCE OVER WHICH THE PLANT STRETCHES IN LENGTH IS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND THROUGH THE VARIOUS BUILDINGS SPREAD OVER THIS SPACE THERE PASSES AUTOMATICALLY IN COURSE OF TREATMENT A VAST QUANTITY OF MATERIAL RESULTING IN THE PRODUCTION OF UPWARD OF TWO AND A QUARTER MILLION POUNDS OF FINISHED CEMENT EVERY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS SEVEN DAYS IN THE WEEK
BOTH FOX AND I WERE RATHER SCARED AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS TO BE THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
THERE WAS ALSO MR ISAACS WHO DID A GREAT DEAL OF PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK AND TO WHOM WE MUST BE THANKFUL FOR THE PICTURES OF MENLO PARK IN CONNECTION WITH EDISON'S WORK
THIS CAUSED THE BEVY TO TURN TO SEE WHERE THE LECTURER WAS
THIS SUITED ME AND I STARTED IN AND SUCCEEDED IN MAKING SUCH AN INSTRUMENT WHICH HAD IN IT THE GERM OF MY QUADRUPLEX NOW USED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD PERMITTING THE DESPATCH OF FOUR MESSAGES OVER ONE WIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY

ONE AFTER ANOTHER RIVAL TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE STOCK TICKER BURGLAR-ALARM AND OTHER COMPANIES HAD STRUNG THEIR CIRCUITS WITHOUT ANY SUPERVISION OR RESTRICTION
EDISON HAD TESTED HIS TASIMETER AND WAS SATISFIED THAT IT WOULD MEASURE DOWN TO THE MILLIONTH PART OF A DEGREE FAHRENHEIT
IT WOULD BE INSTRUCTIVE BUT SCARCELY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE NARRATIVE TO CONDUCT THE READER THROUGH THIS EXTENSIVE PLANT AND SEE ITS MANY INTERESTING OPERATIONS IN DETAIL
IN PRACTICE THIS IS DONE BY MEANS OF A SPECIAL INSTRUMENT KNOWN AS A CONTINUITY PRESERVING TRANSMITTER OR USUALLY AS A TRANSMITTER
WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED WHAT EDISON HAS DONE WHAT THE SUM AND SUBSTANCE OF HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO HUMAN COMFORT AND HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN THE RESULTS AS MEASURED BY LEGAL SUCCESS HAVE BEEN PITIABLE
A KEYBOARD NOT SHOWN IS ARRANGED ABOVE THE CYLINDER HAVING KEYS LETTERED AND NUMBERED CORRESPONDING TO THE LETTERS AND FIGURES ON THE TYPE-WHEELS
HENCE IT WAS NECESSARY TO BECOME A VERY RAPID WRITER SO I STARTED TO FIND THE FASTEST STYLE
THERE WERE CERTAINLY TWO OR THREE HUNDRED
BUT TO THE CARELESS STUPID OR LAZY PERSON HE IS A TERROR FOR THE SHORT TIME THEY REMAIN AROUND HIM
AT THE PERIOD UNDER CONSIDERATION WHICH MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN JUST BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY OF ELECTRIC LIGHT THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE DYNAMO WAS SEEN ONLY IN MYSTERIOUS HAZY OUTLINES--JUST EMERGING FROM THE DARKNESS OF DEPARTING NIGHT
INSTRUMENTS ARE ALL ABOUT ON WALLS TABLES AND SHELVES THE PHOTOMETER IS COVERED UP
GENERALLY SPEAKING ALL CONDUCTORS OF ELECTRICITY OFFER MORE OR LESS RESISTANCE TO THE PASSAGE OF CURRENT THROUGH THEM AND IN THE TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGY OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE THE WORD DROP WHEN USED IN REFERENCE TO A SYSTEM OF DISTRIBUTION IS USED TO INDICATE A FALL OR LOSS OF INITIAL ELECTRICAL PRESSURE ARISING FROM THE RESISTANCE OFFERED BY THE COPPER CONDUCTORS LEADING FROM THE SOURCE OF ENERGY TO THE LAMPS
THE NEXT MATTER WAS THE FINANCING OF THE TRIP ABOUT WHICH MR EDISON ASKED IN A TENTATIVE WAY ABOUT THE RATES TO THE EAST
FROM ANOTHER CAVEAT FILED IN 1889 WE EXTRACT THE FOLLOWING WHICH SHOWS THAT HE REALIZED THE VALUE OF TUNGSTEN ALSO FOR THIS PURPOSE
HE BELIEVED DEEPLY AND FIRMLY IN THE ANALOGY BETWEEN ELECTRICAL SUPPLY AND THAT FOR WATER AND GAS AND POINTED TO THE TRITE FACT THAT NOBODY HOISTED THE WATER AND GAS MAINS INTO THE AIR ON STILTS AND THAT NONE OF THE PRESSURES WERE INIMICAL TO HUMAN SAFETY
WHY WAS IT NOT SHOWN TO MR CURTIS THE LEADING COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANTS IN THE NEW YORK CASES WHEN HE WAS ASKED TO PRODUCE A LAMP AND PROMISED TO DO SO
FOR BREAKFAST TO CATCH THE 7 A.M
THE NON-MAGNETIC GANGUE DESCENDS IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARTITION
INDEED IT WAS THROUGH THE INTRINSIC MERITS OF HIS IMPROVEMENTS IN STOCK TICKERS THAT HE MADE HIS REAL ENTREE INTO COMMERCIAL LIFE
HE DREW THE SHAPE OF THE BULB EXACTLY ON PAPER AND GOT THE EQUATION OF ITS LINES WITH WHICH HE WAS GOING TO CALCULATE ITS CONTENTS WHEN MR EDISON AGAIN APPEARED AND ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS
A SIMILAR INSTANCE IS THAT OF A VISIT PAID TO THE LABORATORY BY SOME ONE BRINGING A GOLD MEDAL FROM A FOREIGN SOCIETY
INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED THAT EDISON IN EXPERIMENTING WITH THE REIS TRANSMITTER RECOGNIZED AT ONCE THE DEFECT CAUSED BY THE MAKE-AND-BREAK ACTION AND SOUGHT TO KEEP THE GAP CLOSED BY THE USE FIRST OF ONE DROP OF WATER AND LATER OF SEVERAL DROPS
TAKING NEXT HIS INVENTIONS THAT PERTAIN TO A MORE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED BUT RAPIDLY EXPANDING BRANCH OF BUSINESS THAT PROVIDES FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE PUBLIC POPULARLY KNOWN AS MOTION PICTURES WE ALSO FIND A GENERAL RECOGNITION OF VALUE CREATED
FOR OVER A SCORE OF YEARS DATING FROM HIS MARRIAGE TO MISS MILLER EDISON'S HAPPY AND PERFECT DOMESTIC LIFE HAS BEEN SPENT AT GLENMONT A BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY ACQUIRED AT THAT TIME IN LLEWELLYN PARK ON THE HIGHER SLOPES OF ORANGE MOUNTAIN NEW JERSEY WITHIN EASY WALKING DISTANCE OF THE LABORATORY AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL IN WEST ORANGE

BUT THIS IS NOT ALL OF THE TROUBLE THAT CONFRONTS US IN THIS CASE
BY REASON OF SUCH A GREATLY EXTENDED LENGTH OF THE ZONE OF ONCOMING MATERIAL AND CONSEQUENTLY MUCH GREATER BULK THE GASES AND OTHER PRODUCTS OF COMBUSTION WOULD BE COOLED SUFFICIENTLY BETWEEN THE COMBUSTION ZONE AND THE STACK SO AS TO LEAVE THE KILN AT A COMPARATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE
ALTHOUGH IT IS ONLY A FEW YEARS SINCE THE BUSINESS PHONOGRAPH HAS BEGUN TO MAKE SOME HEADWAY IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO APPRECIATE THAT EDISON'S PREDICTION IN 1878 AS TO THE VALUE OF SUCH AN APPLIANCE IS BEING REALIZED WHEN WE FIND THAT UP TO THIS TIME THE SALES RUN UP TO 12,695 IN NUMBER
GUM GUIAC 5 LBS
EVERYTHING THAT LEGAL ACUMEN COULD SUGGEST--EVERY SUBTLE TECHNICALITY OF THE LAW--ALL THE COMPLICATED VARIATIONS OF PHRASEOLOGY THAT THE NOVEL NOMENCLATURE OF A YOUNG ART WOULD ALLOW--ALL WERE PRESSED INTO SERVICE AND AVAILED OF BY THE CONTESTORS OF THE EDISON INVENTION IN THEIR DESPERATE EFFORT TO DEFEAT HIS CLAIMS

THE PUBLICATION OF EDISON'S DISCOVERY CREATED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION AT THE TIME CALLING FORTH A STORM OF GENERAL RIDICULE AND INCREDULITY
AS FOR LAMP NO
AS A MATTER OF FACT THE INVENTION OF THE PHONOGRAPH WAS THE RESULT OF PURE REASON
THE FILM BEING STATIONARY DURING THE EXPOSURE AND UPON THE CLOSING OF THE SHUTTER BEING MOVED TO PRESENT A FRESH SURFACE
HE SAID HE MADE A PRETTY GOOD LIVING BY GOING AROUND TO DIFFERENT CLINICS AND GETTING $10 AT EACH CLINIC BECAUSE OF HAVING THE WORST CASE OF HEART-DISEASE ON RECORD
IN EVERY RESPECT EDISON MADE GOOD AND IN A SHORT TIME THE SYSTEM WAS A SUCCESS MR LITTLE HAVING WITHDRAWN HIS OBSOLETE PERFORATOR HIS INEFFECTIVE RESISTANCE HIS COSTLY CHEMICAL SOLUTION TO GIVE PLACE TO EDISON'S PERFORATOR EDISON'S RESISTANCE AND DEVICES AND EDISON'S SOLUTION COSTING A FEW CENTS PER GALLON
WITHIN A FEW DAYS THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY EXPERIMENTS WITH THE SAME KIND OF CARBON BUT IN VACUO BY MEANS OF A HAND-WORKED AIR-PUMP
NOTE HAS BEEN MADE ABOVE OF HIS INVENTION OF A STOCK TICKER IN BOSTON AND OF HIS ESTABLISHING A STOCK-QUOTATION CIRCUIT

THIS IDEA WAS BRILLIANTLY DEMONSTRATED IN PRACTICE IN FEBRUARY 1889 BY MR W
THIS POWDER IS TECHNICALLY KNOWN IN THE TRADE AS CHALK AND IS FED INTO ROTARY KILNS AND BURNED
IT WAS ALL EMPIRICAL ENOUGH
THE INVENTION CONSISTS IN ARRANGING A PLATE DIAPHRAGM OR OTHER FLEXIBLE BODY CAPABLE OF BEING VIBRATED BY THE HUMAN VOICE OR OTHER SOUNDS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A MATERIAL CAPABLE OF REGISTERING THE MOVEMENTS OF SUCH VIBRATING BODY BY EMBOSSING OR INDENTING OR ALTERING SUCH MATERIAL IN SUCH A MANNER THAT SUCH REGISTER MARKS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE A SECOND VIBRATING PLATE OR BODY TO BE SET IN MOTION BY THEM AND THUS REPRODUCE THE MOTIONS OF THE FIRST VIBRATING BODY IT WILL BE AT ONCE OBVIOUS THAT THESE WORDS DESCRIBE PERFECTLY THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF EVERY MODERN PHONOGRAPH OR OTHER TALKING-MACHINE IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS MANUFACTURE OR TRADE NAME

BEE ALL OF WHOM HAVE GROWN UP WITH THE BATTERY AND STILL DEVOTE THEIR ENERGIES TO ITS COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
THIS IS MANIFEST FROM THE HISTORY OF THE ART FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS THE ELECTRICAL LAWS WHICH SINCE THAT TIME HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED AS APPLICABLE TO THE INCANDESCENT LAMP THE IMPERFECT MEANS WHICH THEN EXISTED FOR OBTAINING A VACUUM THE HIGH DEGREE OF SKILL NECESSARY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF ALL ITS PARTS AND THE CRUDE INSTRUMENTS WITH WHICH GOEBEL WORKED
THE EXPERIMENTS WERE OF HEROIC SIZE PHYSICALLY AND FINANCIALLY BUT AFTER A STRUGGLE OF SEVERAL YEARS AND AN EXPENDITURE OF ABOUT $100,000 HE REALIZED THE CORRECTNESS AND PRACTICABILITY OF HIS PLANS IN THE SUCCESS OF THE GIANT ROLLS WHICH WERE THE OUTCOME OF HIS LABORS
AND THE FOLLOWING EXTRACTS THEREFROM WILL AFFORD AN INTELLIGENT COMPREHENSION OF THIS INVENTION

THUS THERE HAS BEEN GRADUALLY BUILT UP A VERY EXTENSIVE BUSINESS UNTIL AT THE PRESENT TIME AN ENORMOUS OUTPUT OF PHONOGRAPHS AND RECORDS IS DISTRIBUTED TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY JOBBERS AND OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND DEALERS
WITH THIS POSITIVE CURRENT THE TELLURIUM PINS MAKE MARKS UPON THE PAPER TAPE BUT THE IRON PINS MAKE NO MARK

FOR A PROPER UNDERSTANDING AND FULL APPRECIATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FINE GRINDING IT MAY BE EXPLAINED THAT PORTLAND CEMENT AS MANUFACTURED IN THE LEHIGH VALLEY IS MADE FROM WHAT IS COMMONLY SPOKEN OF AS CEMENT ROCK WITH THE ADDITION OF SUFFICIENT LIMESTONE TO GIVE THE NECESSARY AMOUNT OF LIME
HE MADE SUCH A SCENE THAT HE HAD TO BE REMOVED BY THE POLICE
WHEN THIS DECISION WAS REACHED MR EDISON AND I TOOK THE JERSEY CENTRAL TRAIN FROM EDISON BOUND FOR ORANGE AND I DID NOT LOOK FORWARD TO THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE WITH ANY DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE AS THE CONCENTRATING PLANT WAS HEAVILY IN DEBT WITHOUT ANY EARLY PROSPECT OF BEING ABLE TO PAY OFF ITS INDEBTEDNESS

EDISON FOUND TIME FOR HIS NEW STUDIES BY LETTING ONE OF HIS FRIENDS LOOK AFTER THE NEWSBOY WORK ON THE TRAIN FOR PART OF THE TRIP RESERVING TO HIMSELF THE RUN BETWEEN PORT HURON AND MOUNT CLEMENS
AND HE REMINDS MR GOULD OF PROMISES MADE TO HIM THE DAY THE TRANSFER HAD BEEN EFFECTED OF EDISON'S INTEREST IN THE QUADRUPLEX
IN THE SELECTION OF THE HEAD OF THIS DEPARTMENT A MAN OF METHODICAL AND ANALYTICAL HABIT OF MIND WAS NECESSARY CAPABLE OF CLEAR REASONING AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE WHO HAD GAINED A THOROUGHLY PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER FIELDS AND THE CHOICE FELL UPON MR W
THE WORLD AT THAT TIME HAD NOT THE SHADOW OF AN IDEA AS TO WHAT THE PRINCIPLES OF A MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM SHOULD BE ENABLING MILLIONS OF LAMPS TO BE LIGHTED OFF DISTRIBUTING CIRCUITS EACH LAMP INDEPENDENT OF EVERY OTHER

AND THIS FILAMENTARY CONDUCTOR REQUIRED TO BE SUPPORTED IN A VACUUM CHAMBER SO PERFECTLY FORMED AND CONSTRUCTED THAT DURING ALL THOSE HOURS AND SUBJECTED AS IT IS TO VARYING TEMPERATURES NOT A PARTICLE OF AIR SHOULD ENTER TO DISINTEGRATE THE FILAMENT
THUS THE NEW ERA HAD BEEN USHERED IN BUT IT WAS BASED ALTOGETHER ON THE CONSUMPTION OF SOME MATERIAL--CARBON--IN A LAMP OPEN TO THE AIR
THERE ARE NO POOR--AT LEAST EVERYBODY IS APPARENTLY WELL-TO-DO
THE UNITED STATES CENSUS OFFICE STATISTICS OF 1902 SHOW THAT THE INCOME FROM INCANDESCENT LIGHTING BY CENTRAL STATIONS HAD BY THAT TIME BECOME OVER 52 PER CENT
WHEN THE END OF THE WIRE WAS RUBBED ON THE STOVE IT GAVE OUT SPLENDID SPARKS
THE MACHINE WAS LAID ASIDE
SHORTLY AFTERWARD I WAS SERVED WITH A PAPER PROBABLY A JUDGMENT WHEREIN I WAS TO PAY NINE MONTHS RENT
IT HAD BEEN SEEN AS HAS BEEN STATED BY MR EDISON MANY TIMES BEFORE HE THOUGHT IT WORTHY OF STUDY IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY SEEN BY PROFESSOR HOUSTON WHO LIKE SO MANY OTHERS FAILED TO EVEN SUSPECT ITS MEANING AND THUS MISSED AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY

THE GRAND TRUNK STILL OWES MR EDISON THE WAGES DUE HIM AT THE TIME HE THUS WITHDREW FROM ITS SERVICE BUT THE CLAIM HAS NEVER BEEN PRESSED
THE GROWTH OF THE TELEPHONE SYSTEMS OF THE UNITED STATES ALSO FURNISHES US WITH STATISTICS OF AN ANALOGOUS NATURE FOR WE FIND THAT THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN THIS INDUSTRY IS AT LEAST 140,000 WHOSE ANNUAL EARNINGS AGGREGATE A MINIMUM OF $75,000,000
THE COMPANY WAS SOON SWAMPED WITH PROPOSITIONS FOR SALE OF TERRITORIAL RIGHTS AND WITH OTHER NEGOTIATIONS AND SOME OF THESE WERE ACCOMPANIED BY THE OFFER OF VERY LARGE SUMS OF MONEY
EDISON'S WORK IN THIS DIRECTION COMPRISED THE INVENTION NOT ONLY OF A SPECIAL FORM OF CAMERA FOR MAKING ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPHIC EXPOSURES FROM A SINGLE POINT OF VIEW WITH VERY GREAT RAPIDITY AND OF A MACHINE ADAPTED TO EFFECT THE REPRODUCTION OF SUCH PICTURES IN SOMEWHAT SIMILAR MANNER BUT ALSO OF THE CONCEPTION AND INVENTION OF A CONTINUOUS UNIFORM AND EVENLY SPACED TAPE-LIKE FILM SO ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR BOTH THE ABOVE OBJECTS
MORE THAN AN HOUR REPLIED THE ASSISTANT
THEY WERE IMPORTANT USEFUL AND VALUABLE AND REPRESENTED A WHOLE LOT OF TREMENDOUS WORK AND MENTAL EFFORT AND I HAD HAD A FEELING OF PRIDE IN HAVING OVERCOME THROUGH THEM A GREAT MANY SERIOUS OBSTACLES ONE OF THESE INVENTIONS COVERED THE MULTIPOLAR DYNAMO
ITS BASIC FEATURES OF OPERATION AS CONCEIVED BY EDISON REMAIN UNCHANGED
THE CONCENTRATE IN FINE POWDERY FORM WAS DELIVERED IN SIMILAR MANNER TO A STOCK-HOUSE
BY 1907 AN EVEN MORE NOTABLE INCREASE WAS SHOWN AND THE CENSUS FIGURES FOR THAT YEAR INCLUDED NO FEWER THAN 6,118,578 STATIONS OF WHICH 1,986,575 WERE INDEPENDENT THESE SIX MILLION INSTRUMENTS EVERY SINGLE SET EMPLOYING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CARBON TRANSMITTER--WERE GROUPED INTO 15,527 PUBLIC EXCHANGES IN THE VERY MANNER PREDICTED BY BELL THIRTY YEARS BEFORE AND THEY GAVE SERVICE IN THE SHAPE OF OVER ELEVEN BILLIONS OF TALKS
THE EFFICIENCY OF THIS SYSTEM WAS INCOMPARABLY GREATER THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER KNOWN CRUSHER OR GRINDER FOR WHILE A PRESSURE OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS COULD BE EXERTED BY THESE ROLLS FRICTION WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY ELIMINATED BECAUSE THE UPPER AND LOWER ROLL BEARINGS TURNED WITH THE ROLLS AND REVOLVED IN THE WIRE ROPE WHICH CONSTITUTED THE BEARING PROPER

HE SAID THAT THE INTIMATE AND CONTINUED COMPANIONSHIP OF AN ACID AND A METAL WAS UNNATURAL AND INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE IDEA OF DURABILITY AND SIMPLICITY
MR EDISON AND MANY LIKE HIM SEE IN REVERSE THE COURSE OF HUMAN PROGRESS
THERE ARE HUMAN LIMITATIONS EVEN FOR SUCH A TIRELESS WORKER AS HE IS
THESE MACHINES ARE KNOWN EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND WHILE THE ANNUAL SALES ARE OF COMPARATIVELY MODERATE AMOUNT IN COMPARISON WITH THE TOTALS OF THE OTHER EDISON INDUSTRIES AT ORANGE THEY REPRESENT IN THE AGGREGATE A COMFORTABLE AND ENCOURAGING BUSINESS
THE NUMEROUS EDISON CENTRAL STATIONS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY REPRESENTED MUCH MORE THAN THAT SUM AND MADE A SPLENDID OUTLET FOR THE PRODUCT OF THE FACTORIES

AND WITH CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY HE ATTEMPTED AGAIN TO BUILD UP A BUSINESS WITH WHICH HIS FAVORITE AND TO HIM MOST INTERESTING INVENTION MIGHT BE SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED
THIS CONDUCTOR WAS A STRIP OF CARBONIZED PAPER ABOUT AN INCH LONG ONE-SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH BROAD AND SIX OR SEVEN ONE-THOUSANDTHS OF AN INCH THICK THE ENDS OF WHICH WERE SECURED TO CLAMPS THAT FORMED THE POLES OF A BATTERY
WE HAVE SAT THROUGH THE LONG WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WHILE EDISON BROODED ON THE REAL SOLUTION OF THE SWARMING PROBLEMS
EDISON'S SYSTEMATIZED ATTACKS ON THE PROBLEM WERE TWO IN NUMBER THE FIRST OF WHICH WE HAVE JUST RELATED WHICH BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 1877 AND CONTINUED UNTIL ABOUT JANUARY 1878
AMONG THE MANY INNOVATIONS APPEARING IN THIS PLANT ARE TWO THAT STAND OUT IN BOLD RELIEF AS INDICATING THE LARGE SCALE BY WHICH EDISON MEASURES HIS IDEAS
AFTER THE EXPERIENCE EDISON COULD NEVER AGAIN BE TEMPTED TO QUIT HIS LABORATORY AND WORK FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
LIEB JR NOW A VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK EDISON COMPANY WAS SENT OVER BY MR EDISON TO STEER THE ENTERPRISE TECHNICALLY AND SPENT TEN YEARS IN BUILDING IT UP WITH SUCH BRILLIANT SUCCESS THAT HE WAS LATER DECORATED AS COMMANDER OF THE ORDER OF THE CROWN OF ITALY BY KING VICTOR
23 1881 265,776 ELECTRIC LIGHTING SYSTEM SEPT
HOW ANY ONE ACQUAINTED WITH THE LAWS OF THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT CAN MAKE SUCH STATEMENTS IS WHAT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND
IN VIEW OF THE CRUDITY OF THE INSTRUMENT AT THAT TIME IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT EDISON'S FORESIGHT AS VINDICATED BY LATER EVENTS WAS MOST REMARKABLE
THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF HEAVY WOOD BLOCKS WELL SHELLACKED OR OTHERWISE TREATED TO MAKE THEM WATER AND WEATHER PROOF PLACED RADIALLY ON THE INSIDE OF THE WHEELS AND THEN SUBSTANTIALLY BOLTED TO THE HUBS AND RIMS OF THE LATTER
101 BELGIUM
EVERY TIME I REPORTED THESE INCREASES MR EDISON WOULD STILL BE DISAPPOINTED
ONE OF THE BOYS WHO WAS WASHING BOTTLES IN THE PLACE HAD READ IN SOME BOOK THAT HYDROGEN WAS EXPLOSIVE SO HE PROCEEDED TO BLOW THE TUB UP
THEN ADVANCED SOUTH ONE THOUSAND FEET
ASIDE FROM OTHER MATERIAL ADVANTAGES IT IS ESTIMATED THAT AT LEAST FROM $15,000,000 TO $20,000,000 HAS BEEN SAVED BY THE EDISON QUADRUPLEX MERELY IN THE COST OF LINE CONSTRUCTION IN AMERICA
AS AGAINST 40 PER CENT
SUPERINTENDENT WALLICK APPEARS TO HAVE TREATED HIM GENEROUSLY AND TO HAVE LOANED HIM INSTRUMENTS A KINDNESS THAT WAS GREATLY APPRECIATED FOR TWENTY YEARS LATER THE INVENTOR CALLED ON HIS OLD EMPLOYER AND TOGETHER THEY VISITED THE SCENE WHERE THE BORROWED APPARATUS HAD BEEN MOUNTED ON A ROUGH BOARD IN THE DEPOT
THEY WERE WELCOMED AND TESTED AND SHORTLY AFTERWARD I SHIPPED A HUNDRED MORE
WHEN I ARRIVED I SAW COMING ALONG THE STREET A RAGMAN WITH A DILAPIDATED OLD HORSE AND ONE OF THE BOYS TOLD HIM TO GO OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD--WHICH WAS THE PLACE WHERE THE CURRENT LEAKED
THE ART IF INDEED THERE CAN BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN AN ART AT THAT TIME WAS IN CHAOTIC CONFUSION AND ONLY BECAUSE OF EDISON'S MANY YEARS STUDY OF THE MAGNET WAS HE ENABLED TO CONCLUDE THAT INSUFFICIENCY IN QUANTITY OF IRON IN THE MAGNETS OF SUCH MACHINES TOGETHER WITH POOR SURFACE CONTACTS RENDERED THE COST OF MAGNETIZATION ABNORMALLY HIGH
18 1875 168,243 AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHS JAN
IN THE SAME CAVEAT HE DESCRIBES AN INVENTION WHEREBY THE POWER TO INDENT ON A PHONOGRAPH CYLINDER INSTEAD OF COMING DIRECTLY FROM THE VOICE IS CAUSED BY POWER DERIVED FROM THE ROTATION OR MOVEMENT OF THE PHONOGRAM SURFACE ITSELF
THE STORAGE BATTERY ALSO GENERATES ELECTRIC CURRENT THROUGH CHEMICAL ACTION BUT WITHOUT INVOLVING THE CONSTANT REPRIMING WITH ACTIVE MATERIALS TO REPLACE THOSE CONSUMED AND EXHAUSTED AS ABOVE MENTIONED

LOWREY THUS CAME TO KNOW EDISON TO CONCEIVE AN INTENSE ADMIRATION FOR HIM AND TO BELIEVE IN HIS ABILITY AT A TIME WHEN OTHERS COULD NOT DETECT THE FIRE OF GENIUS SMOULDERING BENEATH THE MODEST EXTERIOR OF A GAUNT YOUNG OPERATOR SLOWLY FINDING HIMSELF IT WILL BE SEEN THAT MR LOWREY WAS IN A PECULIARLY ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION TO MAKE HIS CONVICTIONS ABOUT EDISON FELT SO THAT IT WAS HE AND HIS FRIENDS WHO RALLIED QUICKLY TO THE NEW BANNER OF DISCOVERY AND LENT TO THE INVENTOR THE AID THAT CAME AT A CRITICAL PERIOD
IN PRACTICE THERE WAS EMPLOYED SUCH A NUMBER OF PERFORATING MACHINES AS THE EXIGENCIES OF BUSINESS DEMANDED

HE WAS SEATED AT THIS BENCH TESTING FIGURING AND PLANNING
THIS WAS DONE WITH THE RESULT THAT THE PATENT WAS ULTIMATELY AWARDED TO BELL IN THE OPENING UP AND DEVELOPMENT OF ANY NEW ART BASED UPON A FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERY OR INVENTION THERE ENSUES NATURALLY AN ERA OF SUPPLEMENTAL OR COLLATERAL INVENTIVE ACTIVITY--THE LEGITIMATE OUTCOME OF THE BASIC ORIGINAL IDEAS
KRUESI WAS VERY EXACT IN HIS EXPRESSIONS
A FURTHER DEFECT WITH THE MUYBRIDGE PICTURES WAS THAT SINCE EACH PHOTOGRAPH WAS SECURED WHEN THE MOVING OBJECT WAS IN THE CENTRE OF THE PLATE THE REPRODUCTION SHOWED THE OBJECT ALWAYS CENTRALLY ON THE SCREEN WITH ITS ARMS OR LEGS IN VIOLENT MOVEMENT BUT NOT MAKING ANY PROGRESS AND WITH THE SCENERY RUSHING WILDLY ACROSS THE FIELD OF VIEW
WHENEVER IT LEAKED OUT IN THE WORLD THAT EDISON WAS SUCCEEDING IN HIS WORK ON THE ELECTRIC LIGHT SPIES AND OTHERS CAME TO THE PARK
AFTER TWO WEEKS HE CAME INTO THE FACTORY IN A TERRIBLE CONDITION AS TO CLOTHES AND FACE
IT WAS NOT OF COURSE BY WAY OF THEATRICAL ANTITHESIS THAT EDISON APPEARED IN PARIS AT SUCH A TIME
THIS AS WE HAVE SEEN WAS ALSO THE CASE WITH THE PHONOGRAPH THE TELEPHONE AND THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
WHILE THERE WAS NO TOUCH OF THE HUMAN HAND UPON THE MATERIAL FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE TREATMENT TO ITS FINISH--THE STAFF BEING EMPLOYED MAINLY TO KEEP WATCH ON THE CORRECT WORKING OF THE VARIOUS PROCESSES
15 1888 437,424 PHONOGRAPH OCT
THE FORMATION OF THE RECORD IN TINFOIL WAS ALSO OBJECTIONABLE FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT SINCE SUCH A RECORD WAS FAINT AND WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY OBLITERATED AFTER TWO OR THREE REPRODUCTIONS
PLANTE COILED UP HIS SHEETS INTO A VERY HANDY CELL LIKE A LITTLE ROLL OF CARPET OR PASTRY
THEORETICALLY THE SYSTEM COULD BE SPLIT UP INTO ANY NUMBER OF NOTES AND SEMI-TONES
EIGHT PARTS HYDRATE TO TWO OF FLAKE
I WAS ONCE WITH MR UPTON CALCULATING SOME TABLES WHICH HE HAD PUT ME ON WHEN MR EDISON APPEARED WITH A GLASS BULB HAVING A PEAR-SHAPED APPEARANCE IN HIS HAND
HERE HE CONTINUED MOREOVER HIS EARLIER WORK ON THE QUADRUPLEX SEXTUPLEX MULTIPLEX AND AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHS AND DID HIS NOTABLE PIONEER WORK IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
REFERRING TO MATTERS THAT WILL BE TAKEN UP LATER IN THE NARRATIVE EDISON SAYS
THE LIFE HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT VARIEGATED BUT NEVER DULL THE FACT REMAINS ALSO THAT THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD EDISON WHILE HIMSELF A VERY ISHMAEL NEVER CEASED TO STUDY EXPLORE EXPERIMENT
I HAD COME OVER TO ACT AS EDISON'S PRIVATE SECRETARY THE POSITION HAVING BEEN OBTAINED FOR ME THROUGH THE GOOD OFFICES OF MR E
A BRIGHT FELLOW ENTERING THE TELEGRAPH SERVICE TO-DAY FINDS THE EXPERIENCE HE MAY GAIN THEREIN VALUABLE BUT HE SOON REALIZES THAT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH GOOD-PAYING OFFICIAL POSITIONS TO GO AROUND SO AS TO GIVE EACH WORTHY MAN A CHANCE AFTER HE HAS MASTERED THE ESSENTIALS OF THE ART
THE PRESS MEN WOULD COME IN AND COPY ANYTHING WHICH COULD BE PUBLISHED WHICH WAS ABOUT THREE PER CENT
MR HENRY VILLARD IT WILL BE REMEMBERED HAD MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF GARRISON THE FAMOUS ABOLITIONIST AND IT WAS THROUGH HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GARRISON FAMILY THAT BROCKTON CAME TO HAVE THE HONOR OF EXEMPLIFYING SO SOON THE PRINCIPLES OF AN ENTIRELY NEW ART
UPON THIS PLATFORM HE WAS GOING TO MOUNT A TELESCOPE TO OBSERVE AN ECLIPSE OFF THE GOLD COAST OF AFRICA
THE FIRST ITEM IN THE FIRST BULLETIN DEALT WITH THE FIRE QUESTION AND ALL THROUGH THE SUCCESSIVE ISSUES RUNS A SERIES OF SIGNIFICANT ITEMS ON THE SAME SUBJECT
EDISON'S PLANS FOR THIS MANUFACTURING PLANT WERE SUFFICIENTLY WELL OUTLINED TO PROVIDE AMPLE CAPACITY FOR THE NATURAL GROWTH OF THE BUSINESS

THE MIMEOGRAPH HOWEVER IS AND HAS BEEN FOR MANY YEARS A STANDARD OFFICE APPLIANCE AND IS ENTITLED TO CONSIDERATION AS THE TOTAL NUMBER PUT INTO USE UP TO THIS TIME IS APPROXIMATELY 180,000 VALUED AT $3,500,000 WHILE THE ANNUAL OUTPUT IS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 9000 MACHINES SOLD FOR ABOUT $150,000 BESIDES THE VAST QUANTITY OF SPECIAL PAPER AND SUPPLIES WHICH ITS USE ENTAILS IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE MANY MILLIONS OF FACSIMILE LETTERS AND DOCUMENTS
FINALLY WHEN THE PRICE HAD REACHED THREE PAIRS FOR ONE CENT ADAMS SAID TO ME
HIS LAMP WAS PRONOUNCED A FAKE A MYTH POSSIBLY A MOMENTARY SUCCESS MAGNIFIED TO THE DIGNITY OF A PERMANENT DEVICE BY AN OVERENTHUSIASTIC INVENTOR

IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG EXPERIMENT UNTIL YOU GET TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE TROUBLE IT IS EASY TO REALIZE THEREFORE THAT A CHARACTER SO THOROUGHLY PERMEATED WITH THESE IDEAS IS NOT APT TO STOP AND FIGURE OUT EXPENSE WHEN IN HOT PURSUIT OF SOME DESIRED OBJECT
AFTER THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE MAGNETIC QUALITIES OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF IRON EDISON BEGAN TO MAKE A STUDY OF WINDING THE CORES FIRST DETERMINING THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE GENERATED PER TURN OF WIRE AT VARIOUS SPEEDS IN FIELDS OF DIFFERENT INTENSITIES
ONE THING I NEVER COULD COMPREHEND WAS THAT TYLER HAD A SIDEBOARD WITH LIQUORS AND GENERALLY CRACKERS
THE LARGEST OF THESE IS LOCATED IN THE SUBURBAN BOROUGH OF THE BRONX AND CONSISTS OF A THREE-STORY-AND-BASEMENT BUILDING OF REINFORCED CONCRETE IN WHICH ARE THE OFFICES DRESSING-ROOMS WARDROBE AND PROPERTY-ROOMS LIBRARY AND DEVELOPING DEPARTMENT
MR EDISON HAS BUILT A VERY INTERESTING MACHINE AND HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE ELECTRICAL ARTS BY FURNISHING AUTHENTIC ACCOUNTS OF ITS CAPABILITIES THE FOREGOING EXTRACTS ARE UNAVOIDABLY LENGTHY BUT VIEWED IN THE LIGHT OF FACTS SERVE TO ILLUSTRATE MOST CLEARLY THAT EDISON'S CONCEPTIONS AND WORK WERE FAR AND AWAY AHEAD OF THE COMPREHENSION OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THE ART AND THAT HIS ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE LINE OF EFFICIENT DYNAMO DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION WERE INDEED TRULY FUNDAMENTAL AND REVOLUTIONARY IN CHARACTER
THERE IS NATURALLY MUCH INTERCOMMUNICATION WHICH WOULD BE GREATLY CURTAILED BY A SYSTEM HAVING THE CAPACITY OF ONLY A SINGLE MESSAGE AT A TIME

THE OUTPUT FROM THIS TIME FORWARD INCREASED STEADILY UP TO THE SPRING OF 1884 WHEN THE DEMANDS OF THE STATION NECESSITATED THE INSTALLATION OF TWO ADDITIONAL JUMBOS IN THE ADJOINING BUILDING WHICH WITH THE VENOUS IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE IN THE MEAN TIME GAVE THE STATION A CAPACITY OF OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND LAMPS ACTUALLY IN SERVICE AT ANY ONE TIME
IT WILL BE NOTED THAT FICTION MAKES NO SHOWING IN THE LIST
AMONG THEM I REMEMBER CARL SCHURZ WHO WAS PLAYING THE PIANO WHEN I ENTERED THE ROOM
ARC LAMPS WERE OPERATED FROM ITS CIRCUITS AND ONE OF THE FIRST SETS OF PRACTICABLE STORAGE BATTERIES WAS USED EXPERIMENTALLY AT THE STATION
NO SUCH DEPARTURE WAS AS RADICAL AS THAT OF THE METHOD OF CRUSHING THE ORE
WHAT WE WANT IS A GOOD LAMP AVERAGE AND NO UNPROFITABLE CUSTOMER
ANOTHER VISITOR FROM EUROPE A LITTLE LATER WAS MR EMIL RATHENAU THE PRESENT DIRECTOR OF THE GREAT ALLGEMEINE ELEKTRICITAETS GESELLSCHAFT OF GERMANY
THE FIRST JUMBO EDISON DYNAMO HAD GONE TO PARIS
HE TELLS AN AMUSING STORY OF ONE DILEMMA INTO WHICH HIS GOOD-NATURE LED HIM AT THIS PERIOD
EDISON THEN ORDERED THE JUICE TO BE TURNED ON SLOWLY
ANOTHER MONTH'S TRIAL SHOWED SOMEWHAT SIMILAR RESULTS
I HAD A LIBRARY AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE AND REMENYI CAME UP THERE
WHILE A LEISURELY ATMOSPHERE PERVADES THE TOWN FEW IDLERS ARE SEEN
WHILE HE HAD NO VERY LIVELY INTEREST IN THE MERE ROUTINE WORK OF A TELEGRAPH OFFICE HE HAD THE PROFOUNDEST CURIOSITY AS TO THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICITY THAT MADE TELEGRAPHY POSSIBLE AND HE HAD AN UNFLAGGING DESIRE AND BELIEF IN HIS OWN ABILITY TO IMPROVE THE APPARATUS HE HANDLED DAILY
AFTER LEAVING THE BOAT HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS OF BREAKFAST
ONCE OR TWICE THEY TOOK FRESH MEASUREMENTS BUT THESE DIDN'T FIT AND THEY HAD TO GO BACK
THUS THE ART WAS SET GOING IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER MANY DIFFICULTIES BUT WITH EVERY SIGN OF COMING TRIUMPH
THE DIFFICULT AND PERPLEXING SITUATION AT THAT TIME IS THUS DESCRIBED BY MAJOR S
ALL WENT OUT OF THE WINDOW
ACHESON WORTH CROSBY HERRICK AND HILL WHILE DOCTOR HAID WAS PLACED BY MR EDISON IN CHARGE OF A SPECIAL CHEMICAL LABORATORY
IN JULY FEELING ENTITLED TO A BRIEF VACATION AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF CONTINUOUS LABOR EDISON WENT WITH THE EXPEDITION TO WYOMING TO OBSERVE AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN AND INCIDENTALLY TO TEST HIS TASIMETER A DELICATE INSTRUMENT DEVISED BY HIM FOR MEASURING HEAT TRANSMITTED THROUGH IMMENSE DISTANCES OF SPACE
THERE S
DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE ORE-MILLING WORK AT EDISON IT BECAME DESIRABLE TO CARRY ON A CERTAIN OPERATION BY SOME SPECIAL MACHINERY
MR EDISON WAS MORE THAN DISAPPOINTED AT THIS RESULT
NEVERTHELESS EDISON CONTINUED ALONG THIS LINE OF EXPERIMENT WITH UNREMITTING VIGOR MAKING IMPROVEMENT AFTER IMPROVEMENT UNTIL ABOUT APRIL 1879 HE DEVISED A MEANS WHEREBY PLATINUM WIRE OF A GIVEN LENGTH WHICH WOULD MELT IN THE OPEN AIR WHEN GIVING A LIGHT EQUAL TO FOUR CANDLES WOULD EMIT A LIGHT OF TWENTY-FIVE CANDLE-POWER WITHOUT FUSION
JOHNSON AND I WENT IN AS PARTNERS AND BERGMANN RENTED AN IMMENSE FACTORY BUILDING AT THE CORNER OF AVENUE B AND EAST SEVENTEENTH STREET NEW YORK SIX STORIES HIGH AND COVERING A QUARTER OF A BLOCK
I WAS TOLD THAT WHILE A MAN MIGHT NOT GET SEASICK ON THE OCEAN IF HE MET A GOOD STORM ON THE CHANNEL IT WOULD DO FOR HIM
THE OPEN CENTRAL SPACE OF LIBERAL DIMENSIONS AND HEIGHT FLANKED BY THE GALLERIES AND RELIEVED BY FOUR HANDSOME ELECTRIC-LIGHTING FIXTURES SUSPENDED FROM THE CEILING BY LONG CHAINS CONVEYS AN IDEA OF LOFTY SPACIOUSNESS
THIS CHAPTER IS OF NECESSITY BRIEF IN ITS REFERENCE TO MANY EXTREMELY INTERESTING POINTS AND DETAILS
IN 1876 I MOVED SAYS EDISON TO MENLO PARK NEW JERSEY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD SEVERAL MILES BELOW ELIZABETH
IN THE CELLAR OF THE EDISON HOMESTEAD YOUNG ALVA SOON ACCUMULATED A CHEMICAL OUTFIT CONSTITUTING THE FIRST IN A LONG SERIES OF LABORATORIES
ONE OF THE GREATEST DELUSIONS OF THE PUBLIC IN REGARD TO ANY NOTABLE INVENTION IS THE BELIEF THAT THE WORLD IS WAITING FOR IT WITH OPEN ARMS AND AN EAGER WELCOME
CHAPTER II EDISON'S PEDIGREE THOMAS ALVA EDISON WAS BORN AT MILAN OHIO FEBRUARY 11 1847
JOHNSON FRESH FROM HIS SUCCESSES IN ENGLAND
11 1889 513,095 PHONOGRAPH DEC
SHE PLUNGED HER ARM BARE AND HERCULEAN BEHIND THE AFOREMENTIONED SOFA AND HOLDING ALOFT A SECTION OF WOOD CALLED OUT IN A MOOD OF DISCOVERY
AND NOT TILL HE GOT THEIR REPORT AS TO AMPLE FACTORS OF SAFETY WAS EDISON REASSURED AS TO THIS DETAIL
THE SUM SEEMED TO BE VERY LARGE FOR THE AMOUNT OF WORK FOR AT THAT TIME I DETERMINED THE VALUE BY THE TIME AND TROUBLE AND NOT BY WHAT THE INVENTION WAS WORTH TO OTHERS
GOODNESS ONLY KNOWS
THE LOCOMOTIVE WOULD BE STARTED WITH THESE RESISTANCE-BOXES IN CIRCUIT AND AFTER REACHING FULL SPEED THE OPERATOR COULD PLUG THE VARIOUS BOXES OUT OF CIRCUIT AND IN THAT WAY INCREASE THE SPEED TO STOP THE ARMATURE CIRCUIT WAS OPENED BY THE MAIN SWITCH AND THE BRAKE APPLIED
AS IT WAS NOT ONLY EDISON BUT ALL THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES WERE KEPT BUSY EXHIBITING AND EXPLAINING THE LIGHT
THE ORGANIZATION WAS CRUDE THE STEAM-ENGINEERING TALENT POOR AND OWING TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF GETTING ANY CONSIDERABLE CAPITAL SUBSCRIBED THE PLANTS WERE PUT IN AS CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE
IN COMMUNICATING BETWEEN POINTS ON LAND POLES OF GREAT HEIGHT CAN BE USED OR CAPTIVE BALLOONS
ON THE OTHER HAND PLATINUM ALTHOUGH FOUND TO BE THE BEST OF ALL MATERIALS FOR THE PURPOSE ASIDE FROM ITS GREAT EXPENSE AND NOT COMBINING WITH OXYGEN AT HIGH TEMPERATURES AS DOES CARBON REQUIRED TO BE BROUGHT SO NEAR THE MELTING-POINT IN ORDER TO GIVE LIGHT THAT A VERY SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE TEMPERATURE RESULTED IN ITS DESTRUCTION
THE FURNACE AT WHICH THE TEST WAS MADE PRODUCES FROM ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED AND TEN TONS PER DAY WHEN RUNNING ON THE ORDINARY MIXTURE
IT HAS ALSO BEEN RELATED HOW HIS PRECIOUS LABORATORY WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE TRAIN
A CERTAIN GROUP OF PERFORATIONS CORRESPONDS TO A MORSE GROUP OF DOTS AND DASHES FOR A LETTER OF THE ALPHABET
IF AN EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE IN THE DAYTIME IT MIGHT LIFT A FEW OF THEM UP
IN THIS RESPECT THE PHENOMENON FOLLOWED THE SAME RULE AS THAT TO WHICH TELEGRAPH WIRES ARE SUBJECT--NAMELY THAT THE LOSS OF INSULATION IS GREATER IN DAMP MURKY WEATHER WHEN THE INSULATORS ARE COVERED WITH WET DUST THAN DURING HEAVY RAINS WHEN THE INSULATORS ARE THOROUGHLY WASHED BY THE ACTION OF THE WATER
SO I WAS TAKEN UP TO LONDON TO SEE THE DYNAMO IN COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION AND THE METHODS EMPLOYED
SOME YEARS LATER ALSO DAFT AGAIN TRIED FRICTION GEAR IN HIS HISTORICAL EXPERIMENTS ON THE MANHATTAN ELEVATED ROAD BUT THE RESULTS WERE ATTENDED WITH NO GREATER SUCCESS
CENTRAL STATIONS AND ISOLATED PLANTS CONSUME OVER 100,000,000 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS ANNUALLY AND IN THE PRODUCTION OF THESE THERE ARE ENGAGED ABOUT FORTY FACTORIES ON WHOSE PAY-ROLLS APPEAR AN AVERAGE OF 14,000 EMPLOYEES EARNING AN AGGREGATE YEARLY SUM OF $8,000,000
IT IS PERHAPS THIS MANY-SIDEDNESS OF EDISON THAT HAS IMPRESSED THE MULTITUDE AND THAT IN THE POPULAR VOTE TAKEN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BY THE NEW YORK HERALD PLACED HIS NAME AT THE HEAD OF THE LIST OF TEN GREATEST LIVING AMERICANS
THE LOCAL PEOPLE CALLED THEM NARROW-GAUGE MULES ASKING THE OPERATOR THE BEST DIRECTION HE POINTED WEST AND NOTICING A RABBIT IN A CLEAR SPACE IN THE SAGE BUSHES I SAID THERE IS ONE NOW I ADVANCED CAUTIOUSLY TO WITHIN ONE HUNDRED FEET AND SHOT
HE ASKED WHAT IT WAS
THE LITIGATION ON THE EDISON LAMP PATENTS WAS ONE OF THE MOST DETERMINED AND STUBBORNLY FOUGHT CONTESTS IN THE HISTORY OF MODERN JURISPRUDENCE
I HAD THESE INSTRUMENTS MADE AT MR HAMBLET'S WHO HAD A LITTLE SHOP WHERE HE WAS ENGAGED IN EXPERIMENTING WITH ELECTRIC CLOCKS
BY REASON OF THIS IMPROVEMENT IT BECAME POSSIBLE TO DO AWAY WITH ALL ADJUSTMENTS THE MASS OF THE COMPENSATING WEIGHT CAUSING THE RECORDER TO ENGAGE THE BLANK AUTOMATICALLY TO THE REQUIRED DEPTH AND TO MAINTAIN THE REPRODUCING STYLUS ALWAYS WITH THE DESIRED PRESSURE ON THE RECORD WHEN FORMED
ADAMS WAS LAID OFF AND AS HIS FINANCIAL RESOURCES HAD REACHED ABSOLUTE ZERO CENTIGRADE I UNDERTOOK TO LET HIM SLEEP IN MY HALL BEDROOM
AS JOHNSON WAS TO SAIL THE NEXT MORNING AT FIVE O'CLOCK EDISON EXPLAINED THAT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF EUROPEAN MATTERS
HE CAME IN LOADED AND ON THE VERGE OF INCOHERENCE
THE EARLIER APPARATUS HAD BEEN BUILT SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR TO THIS AS SHOWN BY A CURIOUS LITTLE ITEM OF NEWS THAT APPEARED IN THE TELEGRAPHER OF JANUARY 30 1869
NOR WERE THE PROBLEMS AND INVENTIONS ALL CONNECTED WITH TELEGRAPHY
BY THE AID OF ANOTHER BOY I LUGGED THE PAPERS TO THE TRAIN AND STARTED FOLDING THEM
THOSE MENTIONED ABOVE ARE BUT FAIR EXAMPLES OF THE PERSISTENT AND EFFECTIVE WORK HE HAS DONE TO BRING THE PHONOGRAPH TO ITS PRESENT STATE OF PERFECTION
I HAD THOUGHT IT WAS DOLLARS IN REGARD TO THIS SINGULAR AND HAPPY CONCLUSION EDISON MAKES SOME INTERESTING COMMENTS AS TO THE ATTITUDE OF THE COURTS TOWARD INVENTORS AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AMERICAN AND ENGLISH COURTS
IN A SHUNT CIRCUIT WITH THE RECEIVING INSTRUMENT HE INTRODUCED ELECTROMAGNETS
ALTHOUGH THEIR SUCCESS WOULD HAVE RENDERED THEM VERY VALUABLE AS A MEANS OF FIGHTING THE BELL PATENT
AND SO THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD NOT HAVE ANY POSSIBILITY OF HAVING ANY MORAL RISK SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE PUT UP NUMEROUS FACTORY BUILDINGS ALL OF STEEL AND CONCRETE WITHOUT ANY COMBUSTIBLE WHATEVER ABOUT THEM--TO AVOID THIS MORAL RISK I AM CARRYING FURTHER THE APPLICATION OF THIS IDEA IN BUILDING PRIVATE HOUSES FOR POOR PEOPLE IN WHICH THERE WILL BE NO MORAL RISK AT ALL--NOTHING WHATEVER TO BURN NOT EVEN BY LIGHTNING AS A CASTING NECESSITATES A MOLD TOGETHER WITH A MIXTURE SUFFICIENTLY FLUID IN ITS NATURE TO FILL ALL THE INTERSTICES COMPLETELY EDISON DEVOTED MUCH ATTENTION TO AN EXTENSIVE SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS FOR PRODUCING A FREE-FLOWING COMBINATION OF NECESSARY MATERIALS
HIS NEXT INVENTIVE STEP COVERED THE DIVISION OF A LARGE CITY DISTRICT INTO A NUMBER OF SMALL SUB-STATIONS SUPPLYING CURRENT THROUGH AN INTERCONNECTED NETWORK OF CONDUCTORS THUS REDUCING EXPENDITURE FOR COPPER TO SOME EXTENT BECAUSE EACH DISTRIBUTION UNIT WAS SMALL AND LIMITED THE DROP
EDISON NOW GRASPED THE GAS PIPE AND WITH THE OTHER HAND HOLDING A PIECE OF METAL HE TOUCHED SEVERAL OTHER METALLIC SUBSTANCES OBTAINED SPARKS SHOWING THAT THE FORCE PASSED THROUGH HIS BODY DECEMBER 3 1875
OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT A CURVE REPRESENTING SOUND VIBRATIONS WILL CORRESPOND PRECISELY TO A CURVE REPRESENTING ELECTRIC IMPULSES PRODUCED OR GENERATED BY THOSE IDENTICAL SOUND VIBRATIONS--AS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE LATTER IMPINGE UPON A DIAPHRAGM ACTING AS AN ARMATURE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET AND WHICH BY MOVEMENT TO AND FRO SETS UP THE ELECTRIC IMPULSES BY INDUCTION
EDISON HAD AS A FACT ALREADY HAD SOME COMMERCIAL EXPERIENCE FROM THE AGE OF ELEVEN
IT MIGHT NATURALLY BE EXPECTED THAT THE ESSENTIAL FACTS OF EDISON'S WORK WOULD APPEAR ON THE FACE OF HIS NUMEROUS PATENTS ON DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINERY BUT SUCH IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE UNLESS THEY ARE CAREFULLY STUDIED IN THE LIGHT OF THE STATE OF THE ART AS IT EXISTED AT THE TIME
HE ALSO PLACED SOME OF THESE REFRACTORY METALS DIRECTLY IN THE CIRCUIT BRINGING THEM TO INCANDESCENCE AND USED SILICON IN POWDERED FORM IN GLASS TUBES PLACED IN THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT
WELL EPSTEIN GOOD-BYE I'VE GOT TO GO DOWN TO WALL STREET EPSTEIN AND HIS ASSISTANT THEN ATTEMPTED TO LIFT THE BOXES TO CARRY THEM OUT BUT COULDN'T
THE DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER-POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL 1899--SEVENTEEN YEARS
IT HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED THAT THE OBJECT OF THE PRESS-LEVER IS TO PRESS THIS TAPE AGAINST THAT CHARACTER OF THE TYPE-WHEEL CENTRALLY LOCATED ABOVE IT AT THE MOMENT
IT WAS ASSUMED INASMUCH AS I HAD JUST ARRIVED FROM LONDON THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE MORE OR LESS INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT
IT IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BELIEVE THAT A LAMP SO CONSTRUCTED COULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY GOEBEL BEFORE 1872
IN THIS INSTANCE DEMANDS FOR ISOLATED PLANTS FOR LIGHTING FACTORIES MILLS MINES HOTELS ETC BEGAN TO POUR IN AND SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE WITH THEM
THERE WERE MANY VITAL THINGS TO BE DONE IN THE EXPLOITATION OF THE SYSTEM THAT EDISON SIMPLY COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT DO
IT IS NOT SURPRISING THEREFORE THAT A MAN OF THIS KIND SHOULD EXHIBIT A CEASELESS ABSORBING DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE AND AN APPARENTLY UNCONTROLLABLE TENDENCY TO EXPERIMENT ON EVERY POSSIBLE OCCASION EVEN THOUGH HIS LAST CENT WERE SPENT IN THUS SATISFYING THE INSATIATE CRAVINGS OF AN INQUIRING MIND
THE SAME NIGHT INSULL MADE HIS FIRST VISIT TO MENLO PARK
10 1883 297,587 DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE
WHEN HE FEELS THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF ACCOMPLISHING A CERTAIN THING HE WILL SETTLE DOWN COMPOSEDLY TO INVESTIGATE IT TO THE END
I REQUESTED HIM TO MAKE A SHEET-BRASS OIL-CUP AND SOLDER IT TO THE BASE I HAD
HE HOLDS IN GENERAL THAT THE METERS OF TO-DAY WHETHER FOR HEAVY OR FOR FEEBLE CURRENTS ARE TOO EXPENSIVE AND THAT CHEAPER INSTRUMENTS ARE A NECESSITY OF THE TIMES
THE ABOVE ARE SUFFICIENT TO ILLUSTRATE THE DIRECT CLEARNESS OF JUDICIAL DECISION ON EDISON'S POSITION AS THE FOUNDER OF THE ART OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING BY INCANDESCENCE
YET ONE MORE INGENIOUS DEVICE OF THIS PERIOD MUST BE NOTED--EDISON'S VOCAL ENGINE THE PATENT APPLICATION FOR WHICH WAS EXECUTED IN AUGUST 1878 THE PATENT BEING GRANTED THE FOLLOWING DECEMBER
ALL OF THESE DETAILS RECEIVED MR EDISON'S PERSONAL CARE AND CONSIDERATION ON THE SPOT IN ADDITION TO THE MULTITUDE OF OTHER AFFAIRS DEMANDING HIS THOUGHT
WHY DID HE NOT SHOW THIS LAMP TO MCMAHON WHEN HE CALLED IN THE INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN COMPANY AND TALKED OVER THE ELECTRICAL MATTERS
WHAT DID AROUSE HIS IRE AND INDIGNATION WAS TO FIND THIS NEW OPPONENT THE LITTLE INCANDESCENT LAMP PUSHING BOLDLY INTO THE FIELD OF INTERIOR LIGHTING CLAIMING IT ON A GREAT VARIETY OF GROUNDS OF SUPERIORITY AND CALMLY IGNORING THE QUESTION OF PRICE BECAUSE IT WAS SO MUCH BETTER
HE FOUND HIMSELF VERY SOON THE SUBJECT OF A FUSILLADE
TRY IT AGAIN WHEN WE BECAME A LITTLE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE OPERATION OF THE KILN WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE OUTPUT UP TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BARRELS AND A LITTLE LATER TO SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY BARRELS PER DAY
NO BETTER ILLUSTRATION OF THIS CHARACTERISTIC CAN BE FOUND THAN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NICKEL POCKET FOR THE STORAGE BATTERY AN ELEMENT THE SIZE OF A SHORT LEAD-PENCIL ON WHICH UPWARD OF FIVE YEARS WERE SPENT IN EXPERIMENTS COSTING OVER A MILLION DOLLARS DAY AFTER DAY ALWAYS APPARENTLY WITH THE SAME TUBES BUT WITH SMALL VARIATIONS CAREFULLY TABULATED IN THE NOTE-BOOKS
THERE HAD BEEN EXACTLY FOUR DECADES OF STEAM NAVIGATION ON AMERICAN WATERS
THE RECORD WAS AS PERFECT AS COPPER PLATE AND NOT A SINGLE REMARK WAS MADE IN THE TIME LOST COLUMN EDISON WAS NOW ASKED IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD GET A GREATER SPEED THROUGH SUBMARINE CABLES WITH THIS SYSTEM THAN WITH THE REGULAR METHODS AND REPLIED THAT HE WOULD LIKE A CHANCE TO TRY IT
IN VIEW OF THE LATER PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES INVOLVED HOWEVER THE READER WILL PROBABLY BE INTERESTED IN PERUSING A FEW EXTRACTS THEREFROM AS ILLUSTRATED BY FACSIMILES OF THE ORIGINAL SKETCHES FROM THE LABORATORY NOTE-BOOK
AS HE CONTEMPLATED THE CONCENTRATION OF SIX THOUSAND TONS DAILY THE EXPENSE OF MANUAL LABOR TO MOVE SUCH AN IMMENSE QUANTITY OF ROCK SAND AND ORE WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITIVE
AND HIS ONE IDEA SEEMED TO BE TO RAISE ALL THE MONEY HE COULD WITH THE OBJECT OF POURING IT INTO THE MANUFACTURING SIDE OF THE LIGHTING BUSINESS
IT MAY BE SAID THAT HIS INVENTION CREATED THE ART OF INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTING OPINIONS OF OTHER COURTS SIMILAR IN TENOR TO THE FOREGOING MIGHT BE CITED BUT IT WOULD BE MERELY IN THE NATURE OF REITERATION
OH HE WAS SO SLOW THAT IT WOULD TAKE HIM HALF AN HOUR TO GET OUT OF THE FIELD OF A MICROSCOPE ANOTHER INSTANCE WILL BE ILLUSTRATIVE
THE BRONX PARK STUDIO OF THE EDISON COMPANY COST AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHILE THE WELL-KNOWN HOUSE OF PATHE FRERES IN FRANCE--ONE OF EDISON'S LICENSEES--MAKES USE OF NO FEWER THAN SEVEN OF THESE GLASS THEATRES
SURELY THE COUNTRY COULD HAVE PRESENTED AT THAT MOMENT NO MORE STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THE PASSIONATE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE UNDER DIFFICULTIES THAN THIS NEWSBOY BARELY FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE WITH HIS JARS AND TEST-TUBES INSTALLED ON A RAILWAY BAGGAGE-CAR
AND HAD EVEN ATTEMPTED TO STRUGGLE THROUGH NEWTON'S PRINCIPIA WHOSE MATHEMATICS WERE DECIDEDLY BEYOND BOTH TEACHER AND STUDENT
AMONG THOSE FIRST SUPPLIED WAS THE BANKING FIRM OF DREXEL MORGAN COMPANY CORNER OF BROAD AND WALL STREETS AT THE OUTERMOST LIMITS OF THE SYSTEM
HE HAD A PECULIAR EYE AND I MADE UP MY MIND THAT THERE WAS A STRAIN OF INSANITY SOMEWHERE
ON MY LOCAL WIRE I GOT IT TO WORK VERY NICELY
THE BEDCLOTHES WERE TOO SHORT AND TOO THIN
ALWAYS AN OMNIVOROUS READER HE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN GETTING A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF LITERATURE FOR HOME CONSUMPTION AND WAS IN THE HABIT OF BUYING BOOKS AT AUCTIONS AND SECOND-HAND STORES
THESE CONFLICTS WERE ESSENTIALLY HARMLESS EXCEPT IN ONE CASE DURING THE BATTLE OF SPION KOPJE WHEN GENERAL CRONJE IN HIS EFFORTS TO FIRE A WOODEN CANNON INADVERTENTLY DROPPED HIS FUSE INTO A LARGE GLASS BOTTLE CONTAINING GUNPOWDER
NOT 491,993 ISSUED FEBRUARY 21 1893
1 1889 437,425 PHONOGRAPH RECORDER
THIS DATE AND EVENT MAY PROPERLY BE REGARDED AS HISTORICAL FOR THEY MARK THE PRACTICAL BEGINNING OF A NEW ART WHICH IN THE INTERVENING YEARS HAS GROWN PRODIGIOUSLY AND IS STILL INCREASING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS

WHILE HOLDING HIS HAND ON THE FRAME OF THE MOTOR HE NOTICED A TREMBLE COINCIDENT WITH THE EXHAUST OF AN ENGINE ACROSS THE ALLEYWAY AND HE THEN KNEW THAT THE POWER CAME FROM THE ENGINE BY A BELT UNDER THE FLOOR SHIFTED ON AND OFF BY A MAGNET THE OTHER MAGNETS BEING A BLIND
THE COATINGS ORDINARILY USED IN ELECTRO-DEPOSITION WERE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION ON ACCOUNT OF COARSENESS THE DEEPEST WAVES OF THE RECORD BEING LESS THAN ONE-THOUSANDTH OF AN INCH IN DEPTH AND MANY OF THEM PROBABLY TEN TO ONE HUNDRED TIMES AS SHALLOW
ACKNOWLEDGMENT MUST ALSO BE MADE OF THE COURTESY AND ASSISTANCE OF MRS EDISON AND ESPECIALLY OF THE LOAN OF MANY INTERESTING AND RARE PHOTOGRAPHS FROM HER PRIVATE COLLECTION
A THIN SPRING CONNECTED TO THE CENTRE OF THE DIAPHRAGM EXTENDED OUTWARDLY AND RESTED ON THE CHALK CYLINDER AND WAS PRESSED AGAINST IT WITH A PRESSURE EQUAL TO THAT WHICH WOULD BE DUE TO A WEIGHT OF ABOUT SIX POUNDS
I BELIEVE PRENTICE WAS THE FATHER OF THE HUMOROUS PARAGRAPH OF THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPER
THESE VARIATIONS PASSING THROUGH THE CHALK CYLINDER PRODUCED MORE OR LESS ELECTROCHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION WHICH IN TURN CAUSED DIFFERENCES OF ADHESION BETWEEN THE PEN AND CYLINDER AND HENCE GAVE RISE TO MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS OF THE DIAPHRAGM BY REASON OF WHICH THE SPEAKER'S WORDS WERE REPRODUCED
IN A WAY THIS IS CURIOUSLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE EARNEST ENERGETIC METHOD OF FRONTAL ATTACK WITH WHICH THE INVENTOR HAS SINCE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO SO MANY PROBLEMS IN THE ARTS AND SCIENCES
THE CLAMPING-IN IS DONE AT GREAT PRESSURE AND THE RESULTANT PLATE HAS GREAT RIGIDITY AND STRENGTH
THE VILLAIN OVERCOME BY A REMORSEFUL CONSCIENCE SEES ON THE WALL OF THE ROOM THE VERY CRIME WHICH HE COMMITTED WITH HIMSELF AS THE PRINCIPAL ACTOR
I ALSO STARTED SCIENCE AND RAN IT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
17 1882 264,654 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
MARCH 24 1879 227,229 ELECTRIC LIGHTS
AS THE JEANNETTE HAD NO STEAM-ENGINE ON BOARD THAT COULD BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE EDISON DESIGNED THE DYNAMO SO THAT IT COULD BE WORKED BY MAN POWER AND TOLD LIEUTENANT DE LONG IT WOULD KEEP THE BOYS WARM UP IN THE ARCTIC WHEN THEY GENERATED CURRENT WITH IT
OF HIS PRODUCT SHOULD PASS THROUGH A 200-MESH SCREEN
WHEN WE STARTED UP THE PLANT EXPERIMENTALLY AND THE LONG KILN WAS FIRST PUT IN OPERATION AN OUTPUT OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED BARRELS IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS WAS OBTAINED
A METHOD OF PREVENTING IN A GREAT MEASURE FRICTION OF WATER AGAINST THE HULL OF A SHIP AND INCIDENTALLY PREVENTING FOULING BY BARNACLES
I SAID I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL RIGHT
21 1888 382,417 MAKING PHONOGRAM BLANKS
THE WOOD WAS IMPORTED IN BOLTS OR PIECES THREE FEET LONG
HENCE THE SUB-DIVISION OF THE LIGHT IS AN ABSOLUTE IGNIS FATUUS THE OTHER EXTRACT IS FROM A BOOK WRITTEN BY PAGET HIGGS LL.D D.SC PUBLISHED IN LONDON IN 1879 IN WHICH HE SAYS
HE DIED IN PARIS OCTOBER 1879 NOT TWENTY YEARS OF AGE
EDISON HAS ALWAYS HAD A GREAT ADMIRATION FOR MARCONI AND HIS WORK AND A WARM FRIENDSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN THE TWO MEN
AND THE OUTCRY AGAINST THE OVERHEAD DEADLY TROLLEY MET WITH HIS INSTANT SYMPATHY
21 1886 1887 468,949 CONVERTER SYSTEM FOR ELECTRIC RAILWAYS FEB
VIEWS OF AN OX TROTTING A WILD BULL ON THE CHARGE GREYHOUNDS AND DEER RUNNING AND BIRDS FLYING IN MID-AIR WERE SHOWN ALSO ATHLETES IN VARIOUS POSITIONS IT MUST NOT BE ASSUMED FROM THIS STATEMENT THAT EVEN AS LATE AS THE WORK OF MUYBRIDGE ANYTHING LIKE A TRUE ILLUSION OF MOVEMENT HAD BEEN OBTAINED BECAUSE SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE
I GOT A LETTER TO MR STILLMAN
THE VEGETABLE STORE I KEPT UP FOR NEARLY A YEAR
AND THE PRACTICE OF PUTTING FUSES ON BOTH SIDES OF A LIGHTING CIRCUIT WAS FIRST USED HERE
THE END OF THE WAR HAD LEFT THE SOUTH A SCENE OF DESTRUCTION AND DESOLATION AND MANY MEN WHO HAD FOUGHT BRAVELY AND WELL FOUND IT HARD TO RECONCILE THEMSELVES TO THE GRIM TASK OF RECONSTRUCTION
BEARD A NOTED PHYSICIST WHO ENTERED ENTHUSIASTICALLY INTO THE INVESTIGATION AND IN ADDITION TO A GREAT DEAL OF INDEPENDENT EXPERIMENT SPENT MUCH TIME WITH EDISON AT HIS LABORATORY
ONE LIFETIME IS TOO SHORT AND I AM BUSY EVERY DAY IMPROVING ESSENTIAL PARTS OF MY ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIES IT MUST SUFFICE TO SPEAK BRIEFLY OF A FEW LEADING INVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT AND TO DISMISS WITH SCANT MENTION ALL THE REST TAKING JUST A FEW ITEMS AS TYPICAL AND SUGGESTIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN EDISON CAN HIMSELF BE QUOTED AS TO THEM
THE DISCIPLES FULL OF FIRE AND ENTHUSIASM AS WELL AS OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE WERE SOON SCATTERED TO THE FOUR WINDS AND THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH THE EDISON SYSTEM WAS EVERYWHERE SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCED IS TESTIMONY TO THE GOOD JUDGMENT WITH WHICH THEIR LEADER HAD ORIGINALLY SELECTED THEM AS HIS COLLEAGUES
NO MODERN TELEPHONE SYSTEM IS IN USE TO-DAY THAT DOES NOT USE THESE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES
MEANTIME BETTER INSTRUMENTS HAD BEEN SECURED AND THE RUDIMENTS OF TELEGRAPHY HAD BEEN FAIRLY MASTERED
HE NOTICED THE LONG HAULS TO MARKET OR ELEVATOR THAT THE FARMERS HAD TO MAKE WITH THEIR LOADS OF GRAIN AT GREAT EXPENSE AND CONCEIVED THE IDEA THAT AS ORDINARY STEAM-RAILROAD SERVICE WAS TOO COSTLY LIGHT ELECTRIC RAILWAYS MIGHT BE CONSTRUCTED THAT COULD BE OPERATED AUTOMATICALLY OVER SIMPLE TRACKS THE PROPELLING MOTORS BEING CONTROLLED AT VARIOUS POINTS
ITS PRACTICE OF COURSE NECESSITATED THE ADDITION OF AN ENTIRELY NEW DEPARTMENT OF THE WORKS WHICH WAS CARRIED INTO EFFECT BY THE CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION OF THE NOVEL MIXING AND BRIQUETTING MACHINERY TOGETHER WITH EXTENSIONS OF THE CONVEYORS WITH WHICH THE PLANT HAD ALREADY BEEN LIBERALLY PROVIDED
2 EQUAL CURRENTS WILL TRAVERSE THE WIRES
IT DESERVES NOTE THAT AT CHICAGO REGULAR RAILWAY TICKETS WERE ISSUED TO PAYING PASSENGERS THE FIRST EVER EMPLOYED ON AMERICAN ELECTRIC RAILWAYS
RESULTS MUST BE REPORTED OFTEN--DAILY OR POSSIBLY WITH STILL GREATER FREQUENCY
THE SCHEME INTERESTED HIS FATHER AND WAS PUT INTO EFFECT THE MESSAGES BEING WRITTEN DOWN AND HANDED OVER FOR PERUSAL
IN OTHER WORDS WITH BELL'S TELEPHONE THE SOUND-WAVES THEMSELVES GENERATE THE ELECTRIC IMPULSES WHICH ARE HENCE EXTREMELY FAINT
HE THEN CAME TO ME AND SAID THAT IF HE COULD RAISE $4000 HE COULD GO INTO SOME KIND OF ORCHARD ARRANGEMENT OUT THERE AND WOULD GIVE ME HALF THE PROFITS
IT IS NOT AN INVENTION OF EDISON BUT THE ORGANIZATION OWNING IT TOGETHER WITH THE PATENT RIGHTS WERE ACQUIRED BY HIM SOME YEARS AGO AND HE HAS SINCE CONTINUED AND ENLARGED THE BUSINESS BOTH IN SCOPE AND VOLUME BESIDES OF COURSE IMPROVING AND PERFECTING THE APPARATUS ITSELF
THE LAMPS WERE PARTLY OF THE HORSESHOE FILAMENT PAPER-CARBON TYPE AND PARTLY BAMBOO-FILAMENT LAMPS AND WERE OF AN EFFICIENCY OF 95 TO 100 WATTS PER 16 C.P
15 1883 298,955 DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE
I NEVER HEARD FROM HIM AFTER HE GOT THE MONEY EDISON TELLS OF ANOTHER SIMILAR EPISODE
IT IS A SINGULAR FACT THAT ELECTRICITY ALSO SO FAR EXCEEDS THE NORMAL RATE AS TO DOUBLE IN VALUE AND QUANTITY OF OUTPUT AND INVESTMENT EVERY FIVE YEARS
THIS FLOOR CONSISTED OF A LARGE HALL CONTAINING SEVERAL LONG TABLES UPON WHICH COULD BE FOUND ALL THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS SCIENTIFIC AND CHEMICAL APPARATUS THAT THE ARTS AT THAT TIME COULD PRODUCE
AND ARRIVED AGAIN AT 9.30 P.M
THOUGH THE TYPE HAS GONE OUT OF EXISTENCE LIKE SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE USEFUL IN THEIR DAY AND GENERATION IT WAS ONCE A VERY VITAL PART OF THE ART AND ONE MORE ILLUSTRATION OF THAT INTIMATE MANNER IN WHICH THE ADVANCES IN DIFFERENT FIELDS OF PROGRESS INTERACT AND CO-OPERATE
NOW MR BERGMANN SAID EPSTEIN HOW MUCH FOR THE LOT EPSTEIN SAID BERGMANN YOU HAVE CHEATED ME AND I WILL NO LONGER SELL BY THE LOT BUT WILL SELL ONLY BY THE POUND NO AMOUNT OF ARGUMENT WOULD APPARENTLY CHANGE BERGMANN'S DETERMINATION TO SELL BY THE POUND BUT FINALLY EPSTEIN GOT UP TO $250 FOR THE LOT AND BERGMANN APPEARING AS IF DISGUSTED ACCEPTED AND MADE HIM COUNT OUT THE MONEY
FILAMENTS OF CARBON PLACED IN A COMBUSTION TUBE WITH A LITTLE CHLORIDE AMMONIUM
1 I WAS REQUESTED TO WORK THE PRESS WIRE CALLED THE MILK ROUTE AS THERE WERE SO MANY TOWNS ON IT TAKING PRESS SIMULTANEOUSLY
PUBLISHED DATES WILL SHOW THAT HUGHES CAME ALONG AFTER ME THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER WAYS ALSO IN WHICH EDISON HAS UTILIZED THE PECULIAR PROPERTY THAT CARBON POSSESSES OF ALTERING ITS RESISTANCE TO THE PASSAGE OF CURRENT ACCORDING TO THE PRESSURE TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECTED WHETHER AT THE SURFACE OR THROUGH CLOSER UNION OF THE MASS
HENCE THE ETHERIC-FORCE INVESTIGATIONS WERE SIDE-TRACKED FOR OTHER MATTERS DEEMED TO BE MORE IMPORTANT AT THAT TIME
AS A MATTER OF FACT THE INVESTIGATORS PRECEDING EDISON DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF A SYSTEM AT ALL
THE USE OF JAPANESE BAMBOO FOR CARBON FILAMENTS WAS THEREFORE CONTINUED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF LAMPS ALTHOUGH AN INCESSANT SEARCH WAS MAINTAINED FOR A STILL MORE PERFECT MATERIAL
AND YET THERE IS A PECULIARITY ABOUT HIM THAT SO FAR AS IS KNOWN HAS NEVER BEEN REFERRED TO BEFORE IN PRINT
IT IS TRUE THERE WERE SEVERAL TYPES OF MACHINES IN USE FOR THE THEN VERY LIMITED FIELD OF ARC LIGHTING BUT THEY WERE REGARDED AS VALUELESS AS A PART OF A GREAT COMPREHENSIVE SCHEME WHICH COULD SUPPLY EVERYBODY WITH LIGHT
THE DUPLEXES ABOVE DESCRIBED COULD NOT BE USED ON A RAILROAD TELEGRAPH SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE NECESSITY OF ELECTRICALLY BALANCING THE LINE WHICH WHILE ENTIRELY FEASIBLE ON A THROUGH LINE WOULD NOT BE PRACTICABLE BETWEEN A NUMBER OF INTERCOMMUNICATING POINTS
IN THE HOLBORN VIADUCT STATION THE DIFFICULTY OF HUNTING WAS NOT EXPERIENCED
TO THE GATEMAN EVERY ONE WAS PERSONA NON GRATA WITHOUT PROPER CREDENTIALS AND EDISON HAD TO WAIT OUTSIDE UNTIL HE COULD GET SOME ONE TO IDENTIFY HIM
IT WILL BE NOTED THAT THESE FIGURES ARE ALL IN ROUND NUMBERS BUT THEY ARE BELIEVED TO BE WELL WITHIN THE MARK BEING PRIMARILY FOUNDED UPON THE SPECIAL REPORTS OF THE CENSUS BUREAU ISSUED IN 1902 AND 1907 WITH THE NATURAL INCREASE FROM THAT TIME COMPUTED BY EXPERTS WHO ARE IN POSITION TO OBTAIN THE FACTS
FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING-CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
THEN AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED HE WENT TO THE CIGAR COUNTER AND PURCHASED CIGARS
WELL EDISON I MUST GO NOW
16 1876 200,993 ACOUSTIC TELEGRAPH AUG
ONE OF THEM THAT I VISITED WAS IN A BAPTIST CHURCH THE MAN WITH THE WHEEL BEING IN THE PULPIT AND THE GAMBLERS IN THE PEWS
THE INDICATING MECHANISM HE NOW DEVISED WAS ELECTRICAL CONTROLLED AT CENTRAL BY TWO CIRCUIT-CLOSING KEYS AND WAS A PROTOTYPE OF ALL THE LATER AND MODERN STEP-BY-STEP PRINTING TELEGRAPHS UPON WHICH THE DISTRIBUTION OF FINANCIAL NEWS DEPENDS
16 1905 880,978 ELECTRODE ELEMENTS FOR STORAGE BATTERIES
HE DRIFTED TWO MONTHS LATER TO INDIANAPOLIS ARRIVING THERE IN THE FALL OF 1864 WHEN HE WAS AT FIRST ASSIGNED TO DUTY AT THE UNION STATION AT A SALARY OF $75 A MONTH FOR THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY WHOSE SERVICE HE NOW ENTERED AND WITH WHICH HE HAS BEEN DESTINED TO MAINTAIN HIGHLY IMPORTANT AND CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS THROUGHOUT A LARGE PART OF HIS LIFE

HAMMER IN THE THREE-THOUSAND-LIGHT CENTRAL STATION ON HOLBORN VIADUCT THE PLANT GOING INTO OPERATION ON JANUARY 12 1882
ONE CANNOT RESIST SPECULATION AS TO WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO EDISON HIMSELF AND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICITY HAD HE MADE THIS PROPOSED PLUNGE INTO THE ENERVATING TROPICS
THE HEATING OF SOLID ARMATURES THE ONLY KIND THEN KNOWN AND POOR INSULATION IN THE COMMUTATORS ALSO GAVE RISE TO SERIOUS LOSSES
NEW METHODS WERE SUGGESTED
WE PREDICT THAT THE TIME IS NOT FAR DISTANT WHEN IN MANY OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS TWO OR THREE HOURS A WEEK WILL BE DEVOTED TO THIS RATIONAL AND EFFECTIVE FORM OF EDUCATION
AS TO THE REMOVAL FROM NEWARK HE MAY BE ALLOWED TO TELL HIS OWN STORY
I HAD LEFT LOUISVILLE THE SECOND TIME AND WENT HOME TO SEE MY PARENTS
THE PERCENTAGE OF DROP VARIES ACCORDING TO THE QUANTITY OF COPPER USED IN CONDUCTORS BOTH AS TO CROSS-SECTION AND LENGTH
BUT ASSUMING THEY WERE MADE THEY DO NOT ANTICIPATE THE INVENTION OF EDISON
25 1873 160,402 SOLUTIONS FOR CHEMICAL TELEGRAPH PAPERSEPT
THE VERY BROAD PATENT TAKEN OUT BY THIS SIMPLE MECHANIC SO FAR AHEAD OF HIS TIMES WAS THE FIRST ONE ISSUED IN AMERICA FOR AN ELECTRIC MOTOR
IT HAD BEEN OUTGROWN IN MANY WAYS AND STRANGE AS THE REMARK MAY SEEM IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HAD LEFT IT BEHIND AND HAD SETTLED IN ORANGE NEW JERSEY THAT HE CAN BE SAID TO HAVE GIVEN DEFINITE SHAPE TO HIS LIFE
A LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEER HAD BEEN ENGAGED AS IT WAS SUPPOSED HE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF ANYTHING
IT CONSISTED OF A METALLIC CYLINDER HAVING A HELICAL INDENTING GROOVE CUT UPON IT FROM END TO END
MARCH 5 1883 287,517 SYSTEM OF ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION
MOST NOVEL OF ALL THE APPARATUS OF THIS MEASURING KIND IS THE ODOROSCOPE WHICH IS LIKE THE TASIMETER DESCRIBED IN AN EARLIER CHAPTER EXCEPT THAT A STRIP OF GELATINE TAKES THE PLACE OF HARD RUBBER AS THE SENSITIVE MEMBER
WITH THESE FACTS BEFORE HIM EDISON REASONED THAT IF THE PAPER STRIP COULD BE IMPRINTED WITH ELEVATIONS AND DEPRESSIONS REPRESENTATIVE OF SOUND-WAVES THEY MIGHT BE CAUSED TO ACTUATE A DIAPHRAGM SO AS TO REPRODUCE THE CORRESPONDING SOUNDS
IN A REVIEW OF THE TICKER ART MR CALLAHAN STATED WITH RATHER GRUDGING PRAISE THAT A TICKER AT THE PRESENT TIME 1901 WOULD BE CONSIDERED AS IMPRACTICABLE AND UNSALABLE IF IT WERE NOT PROVIDED WITH A UNISON DEVICE AND HE GOES ON TO REMARK
LARGE GRANARIES WERE ESTABLISHED AND PROVED SO SUCCESSFUL THAT LOCAL CAPITAL WAS TEMPTED INTO THE PROJECT OF MAKING A TOW-PATH CANAL FROM LOCKWOOD LANDING ALL THE WAY TO MILAN ITSELF
CLOWRY PRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY
AFTER WORKING ALL DAY I WORKED AT THE OFFICE NIGHTS AS WELL FOR THE REASON THAT PRESS REPORT CAME OVER ONE OF THE WIRES UNTIL 3 A.M AND I WOULD CUT IN AND COPY IT AS WELL AS I COULD TO BECOME MORE RAPIDLY PROFICIENT
BUT IT IS NOT TO BE INFERRED THAT THE ATMOSPHERE OF GRIM DETERMINATION AND PERSISTENT PURSUIT OF THE NEW INVENTION CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS PERIOD MADE LIFE A BURDEN TO THE SMALL FAMILY OF LABORERS ASSOCIATED WITH EDISON
FREQUENTLY THEREFORE IN THE PRODUCTION OF A MOTION-PICTURE PLAY THE FIRST AND THE LAST SCENE MAY BE TAKEN SUCCESSIVELY THE ONLY THING NECESSARY BEING OF COURSE THAT AFTER ALL IS DONE THE VARIOUS SCENES SHOULD BE ARRANGED IN THEIR PROPER ORDER
CURRENT WAS FED FROM A DYNAMO TO THE MOTOR THROUGH A CENTRAL THIRD RAIL THE TWO OUTER RAILS BEING JOINED TOGETHER AS THE NEGATIVE OR RETURN CIRCUIT
BUT NO ONE IN ANY WAY ACQUAINTED WITH NEWARK AS A SWARMING CENTRE OF MISCELLANEOUS AND MULTITUDINOUS INDUSTRIES WOULD RECOMMEND IT AS A CLOISTERED RETREAT FOR BROODING REVERIE AND INTROSPECTION FAVORABLE TO CREATIVE EFFORT
AGAIN IN CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT EDISON WAS ONE OF THE FIRST IN THE FIELD TO DESIGN AND PERFECT A PRACTICAL AND OPERATIVE ELECTRIC RAILWAY THE MAIN FEATURES OF WHICH ARE USED IN ALL ELECTRIC ROADS OF TO-DAY WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH THE PROBLEM AS TO WHAT PROPORTION OF THEIR COLOSSAL INVESTMENT AND EARNINGS SHOULD BE ASCRIBED TO HIM
THEY LANDED AT ELIZABETHPORT NEW JERSEY AND FIRST SETTLED NEAR CALDWELL IN THAT STATE WHERE SOME GRAVES OF THE FAMILY MAY STILL BE FOUND
EDISON WAS FROM THE FIRST DEEPLY IMPRESSED WITH THE POSSIBILITIES OF WATER-POWER AND AS THIS INCIDENT SHOWS WAS PROMPT TO SEIZE SUCH A VERY EARLY OPPORTUNITY
IT WAS WHILE THUS ENGAGED THAT MR EDISON CAME TO ME ONE DAY AND SAID
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY HE SAT UNDER A LARGE TREE IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE FACING A WELL-TRAVELLED ROAD
THIS TRAIN GENERALLY HAD FROM SEVEN TO TEN COACHES FILLED ALWAYS WITH NORWEGIANS ALL BOUND FOR IOWA AND MINNESOTA
DURING THE YEAR 1880 EDISON HAD MADE APPLICATION FOR SIXTY PATENTS OF WHICH THIRTY-TWO WERE IN RELATION TO INCANDESCENT LAMPS
A LOUD-SPEAKING TELEPHONE WITH QUARTZ CYLINDER AND BEAM OF ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT
THIS WAS SUCH A VIOLENT JUMP FROM ANYTHING I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE THAT IT RATHER PARALYZED ME FOR A WHILE I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO MUCH TO BE LASTING BUT I DETERMINED TO TRY AND LIVE UP TO THAT SALARY IF TWENTY HOURS A DAY OF HARD WORK WOULD DO IT
ALL PICTURES ARE NOT TAKEN IN STUDIOS BECAUSE WHEN LIGHT AND WEATHER PERMIT AND PROPER SURROUNDINGS CAN BE SECURED OUTSIDE SCENES CAN BEST BE OBTAINED WITH NATURAL SCENERY--CITY STREETS WOODS AND FIELDS

EDISON HIS LIFE AND INVENTIONS CHAPTER I THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY THE YEAR 1847 MARKED A PERIOD OF GREAT TERRITORIAL ACQUISITION BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH INCALCULABLE ADDITIONS TO THEIR ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL WEALTH
IT SOUNDS LIKE HERESY TO SAY THAT EDISON BECAME AN ELECTRICIAN BY CHANCE BUT IT IS THE SOBER FACT THAT TO THIS PRE-EMINENT AND BRILLIANT LEADER IN ELECTRICAL ACHIEVEMENT ESCAPE INTO THE CHEMICAL DOMAIN STILL HAS THE ASPECT OF A DELIGHTFUL TRUANT HOLIDAY
AND SECOND GREAT INVENTORS WHO HAVE MADE GRASS GROW PLENTIFULLY ON HITHERTO UNPRODUCTIVE GROUND
THE MANAGER ASKED ME WHEN I WAS READY TO GO TO WORK
SOMETIMES AS THIS WAS TAKING PLACE EDISON WOULD FOLD HIS HANDS COMPOSE HIMSELF AS IF HE WERE IN SOUND SLEEP AND WHEN THE LIGHTS WERE FULL AGAIN WOULD APPARENTLY WAKE UP WITH THE REMARK WELL BOYS WE'VE HAD A FINE REST

ANILINE RED 1 LB
TO QUOTE FROM AN OFFICIAL BELL STATEMENT
LATE IN THE SAME YEAR PATENT LITIGATION WAS BEGUN WHICH BROUGHT OUT CLEARLY THE MERITS OF BELL THROUGH HIS PATENT AS THE ORIGINAL AND FIRST INVENTOR OF THE ELECTRIC SPEAKING TELEPHONE
IT IS CURIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT IN THIS CONNECTION THAT OF THE TWENTY-ONE PRESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL SOCIETY THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS FOUNDED IN 1884 EIGHT HAVE BEEN INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH EDISON--NAMELY NORVIN GREEN AND F
AS A SAMPLE STORY OF ADVENTURE MR MCGOWAN'S NARRATIVE IS A MARVEL FIT TO BE CLASSED WITH THE HISTORIC JOURNEYINGS OF THE GREATEST TRAVELLERS
EVERY ONE OF THE SIX MILLION TELEPHONES IN USE IN THE UNITED STATES AND OF THE OTHER MILLIONS IN USE THROUGH OUT THE WORLD BEARS THE IMPRINT OF HIS GENIUS AS AT ONE TIME THE INSTRUMENTS BORE HIS STAMPED NAME
THE ATTITUDE TOWARD FOREIGNERS THIRTY YEARS AGO WAS NOT AS FRIENDLY AS IT HAS SINCE BECOME BUT EDISON AS USUAL HAD MADE A HAPPY CHOICE OF MESSENGERS AS MR MOORE'S GOOD NATURE AND DIPLOMACY ATTESTED
JUNE 3 1891 475,492 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE
THE EDISON SYSTEM OF LIGHTING WAS AS BEAUTIFULLY CONCEIVED DOWN TO THE VERY DETAILS AND AS THOROUGHLY WORKED OUT AS IF IT HAD BEEN TESTED FOR DECADES IN VARIOUS TOWNS
I WAS VERY FOND OF STORIES AND HAD A CHOICE LOT ALWAYS KEPT FRESH WITH WHICH I COULD USUALLY THROW A MAN INTO CONVULSIONS
HE WENT DOWN TO DREXEL MORGAN COMPANY'S OFFICE TO INVESTIGATE AND AFTER LOOKING AROUND ASKED WHEN THE OFFICE WAS CLEANED OUT
THE PRICE WAS THREE CENTS A COPY OR EIGHT CENTS A MONTH FOR REGULAR SUBSCRIBERS AND THE CIRCULATION RAN UP TO OVER FOUR HUNDRED COPIES AN ISSUE
BUT HE WAS NOT TEASED ANY MORE
THE BOARD WAS CHEAP BEING ONLY $1.50 PER WEEK

THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE NOT INDIFFERENT BUT ARE FOREVER ON THE SIDE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE AND THERE NEVER WAS ANY ONE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE DEFECTS OF EVERY ART AND APPLIANCE NOR ANY ONE MORE ACTIVE IN APPLYING THE LAW OF EVOLUTION

HIS FACILITY IN MAKING HASTY BUT INTENSELY GRAPHIC SKETCHES IS PROVERBIAL
HE WENT BACK TO CALIFORNIA AND GOT INTO MINING CLAIMS AND INTO FRUIT-GROWING AND BECAME ONE OF THE POLITICIANS OF THE COAST AND I BELIEVE WAS ON THE STAFF OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE
HE HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD WORK FOR WHICH OTHERS HAVE RECEIVED THE CREDIT
I REMEMBER IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT HE WANTED A MERCURY PUMP FOR EXHAUSTING THE LAMPS
DURING SOME OF THESE WAITS MR EDISON HAD SEEN ME PLAY BILLIARDS
THESE KILNS WERE USUALLY MADE OF BOILER IRON RIVETED AND WERE ABOUT SIXTY FEET LONG AND SIX FEET IN DIAMETER AND HAD A CAPACITY OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED BARRELS OF CEMENT CLINKER IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
IN HIS EXPERIMENTS WITH THE PLATINUM-IRIDIUM LAMPS HE HAD BEEN WORKING ALL THE TIME TOWARD THE PROPOSITION OF HIGH RESISTANCE AND SMALL RADIATING SURFACE UNTIL HE HAD MADE A LAMP HAVING THIRTY FEET OF FINE PLATINUM WIRE WOUND UPON A SMALL BOBBIN OF INFUSIBLE MATERIAL
BUT IN A FEW MONTHS THE BELL SYSTEM HAD ITS BATTERY TRANSMITTER TOO TENDING TO EQUALIZE MATTERS
IT WAS A CAGE WITH TIN-FOIL HANGING ALL ROUND IT
THEN I GOT PLEURISY AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY WENT BACK TO 1878
OFFICES WERE TAKEN FOR THE NEW ENTERPRISE AT 203 BROADWAY WHERE THE MAIL AND EXPRESS BUILDING NOW STANDS AND WHERE IN A GENERAL WAY UNDER THE AUSPICES OF A TALENTED DWARF C
ONE THING OR THE OTHER MUST WAIT
WE HAD NO MEANS OF BORING OUT THE FIELD MAGNETS AND WE CUT GROOVES IN THEM
THERE WAS NO OPENING IN THE FRANKLIN OFFICE SO ADAMS WENT OVER TO THE WESTERN UNION OFFICE AND ASKED THE MANAGER MR GEORGE F
IN THE PICTURE MR EDISON MAY BE SEEN IN THE CAB AND MR INSULL ON THE FRONT PLATFORM OF THE PASSENGER-CAR
THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHERS AND IT MIGHT BE SAID WITH TRUTH THAT EDISON IS HARDLY EVER WITHOUT SOME NEW DEVICE OF THIS KIND IN HAND AS HE IS BY NO MEANS SATISFIED WITH THE PRESENT STATUS OF ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS

A PIECE OF THE ORE MAGNETITE MAY BE REDUCED TO POWDER AND THE ORE PARTICLES SEPARATED THEREFROM BY THE HELP OF A SIMPLE HAND MAGNET
WE GOT A GANG OF MEN CUT THE CURRENT OFF FOR SEVERAL JUNCTION-BOXES AND FIXED THE LEAK
BUT UP TO THE TIME OF LEASING 65 FIFTH AVENUE IT HAD NOT BEEN ENGAGED IN ACTUAL BUSINESS
THE NET RESULT OF BOTH FINANCIAL OPERATIONS WAS HOWEVER TO DETACH EDISON FROM THE SPECIAL FIELD OF INVENTION TO WHICH HE HAD GIVEN SO MANY OF HIS MOST FRUITFUL YEARS

WHEN A TRIANGLE OF THREE HOLES INTENDED TO FORM THE DASH REACHED THE WHEELS ONE OF THEM DROPPED INTO A LOWER HOLE
HENCE IT WAS NECESSARY THAT FOR SUCH WORK THE RELATIVELY HEAVY AND EXPENSIVE ELECTRIC MOTOR SHOULD BE DISCARDED AND A SIMPLE SPRING MOTOR CONSTRUCTED WITH A SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE GOVERNOR TO PERMIT ACCURATE MUSICAL REPRODUCTION

30 1888 389,369 INCANDESCING ELECTRIC LAMP FEB
SUFFERED THE PAINS OF HELL WITH MY EYES LAST NIGHT FROM 10 P.M
ONE TIME WHEN THEY HAD A SNOW BLOCKADE IN NEW YORK I STARTED TO BUILD A MACHINE WITH BATCHELOR--A BIG TRUCK WITH A STEAM-ENGINE AND COMPRESSOR ON IT
BERNHARDT GAVE ME TWO PICTURES PAINTED BY HERSELF WHICH SHE SENT ME FROM PARIS REFERENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE TO THE CALLERS UPON EDISON
THIS DIDN'T PAY AND HE BECAME THE EDITOR OF A NEWSPAPER
THEN TO ACCOMPANY HIM INTO THE GREAT CREATIVE STRETCH OF FORTY YEARS DURING WHICH HE HAS DONE SO MUCH
HE FOUND ABSOLUTELY NONE
IT IS TRUE THAT THE RECORD OF THE CHATTERING LITTLE MACHINE MADE IN CABALISTIC ABBREVIATIONS ON THE TAPE CAN DRIVE A MAN SUDDENLY TO THE VERY VERGE OF INSANITY WITH JOY OR DESPAIR
IF TO SEE WITH THE EYES A PHENOMENON IS TO DISCOVER THE LAW OF WHICH THAT PHENOMENON IS A PART THEN EVERY SCHOOLBOY WHO BEFORE THE TIME OF NEWTON EVER SAW AN APPLE FALL WAS A DISCOVERER OF THE LAW OF GRAVITATION EDISON TOOK OUT ONLY ONE PATENT ON LONG-DISTANCE TELEGRAPHY WITHOUT WIRES
NOT ONLY WAS IT A LAMP AS A MERE ARTICLE--A DEVICE TO GIVE LIGHT--BUT IT WAS ALSO AN INTEGRAL PART OF HIS GREAT AND COMPLETE SYSTEM OF LIGHTING TO EVERY PART OF WHICH IT BORE A FIXED AND DEFINITE RATIO AND IN RELATION TO WHICH IT WAS THE KEYSTONE THAT HELD THE STRUCTURE FIRMLY IN PLACE
ONE DAY I RECEIVED A CABLE FROM GOURAUD OFFERING 30,000 FOR MY INTEREST
I SOLD THIRTY-FIVE PAPERS THERE
THEN HE WOULD QUIT
HE HAD STUDIED AND EXPERIMENTED WITH ELECTROMAGNETS IN ENORMOUS VARIETY AND KNEW THEIR PECULIARITIES IN CHARGE AND DISCHARGE LAG SELF-INDUCTION STATIC EFFECTS CONDENSER EFFECTS AND THE VARIOUS OTHER PHENOMENA CONNECTED THEREWITH
THE RECORD MADE IN NEW YORK ON THE EDISON PHONOGRAPH WAS REPEATED INTO AN EDISON CARBON TRANSMITTER SENT OVER ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILES OF CIRCUIT INCLUDING SIX MILES OF UNDERGROUND CABLE
FROM THE EARLY DAYS OF PICTURES REPRESENTING SIMPLE MOVEMENTS SUCH AS A MAN SNEEZING OR A SKIRT-DANCE THERE HAS BEEN A GRADUAL EVOLUTION UNTIL NOW THE PICTURES REPRESENT NOT ONLY ACTUAL EVENTS IN ALL THEIR PALPITATING INSTANTANEITY BUT HIGHLY DEVELOPED DRAMAS AND SCENARIOS ENACTED IN LARGE WELL-EQUIPPED GLASS STUDIOS AND THE RESULT OF INFINITE PAINS AND EXPENSE OF PRODUCTION
LOOMS AND TOOLS AND PRINTING-PRESSES WERE EVERYWHERE BEING LIBERATED FROM THE SLOW TOIL OF MAN-POWER
THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE OF HEAT IMPARTED TO IT CAUSES IT TO EXPAND INVISIBLY THUS INCREASING THE PRESSURE CONTACT ON THE CARBON BUTTON AND PRODUCING A VARIATION IN THE RESISTANCE OF THE CIRCUIT REGISTERED IMMEDIATELY BY THE LITTLE SWINGING NEEDLE OF THE GALVANOMETER
THAT MADE THE TAMMANY MAN ALL SAFE
VANDERBILT AND THE OTHER DIRECTORS CAME IN
WE HAVE MADE A FRIEND OF THE BANK AND WE MAY NEED FRIENDS LATER ON AND SO IT HAPPENED THAT SOME TIME AFTERWARD WHEN WE GREATLY NEEDED HELP IN THE WAY OF LOANS THE BANK WILLINGLY GAVE US THE ACCOMMODATIONS WE REQUIRED TO TIDE US OVER A CRITICAL PERIOD THIS IRON-ORE CONCENTRATING PROJECT HAD LAIN CLOSE TO EDISON'S HEART AND AMBITION--INDEED IT HAD PERMEATED HIS WHOLE BEING TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALMOST ALL OTHER INVESTIGATIONS OR INVENTIONS FOR A WHILE
SEEING THAT THE TASIMETER IS AFFECTED BY A WIDER RANGE OF ETHERIC UNDULATIONS THAN THE EYE CAN TAKE COGNIZANCE OF AND IS WITHAL FAR MORE ACUTELY SENSITIVE THE PROBABILITIES ARE THAT IT WILL OPEN UP HITHERTO INACCESSIBLE REGIONS OF SPACE AND POSSIBLY EXTEND THE RANGE OF AERIAL KNOWLEDGE AS FAR BEYOND THE LIMIT OBTAINED BY THE TELESCOPE AS THAT IS BEYOND THE NARROW REACH OF UNAIDED VISION THE ECLIPSE OVER EDISON WITH PROFESSOR BARKER MAJOR THORNBERG SEVERAL SOLDIERS AND A NUMBER OF RAILROAD OFFICIALS WENT HUNTING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES SOUTH OF THE RAILROAD IN THE UTE COUNTRY
IN OTHER WORDS EDISON CREATED THE INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP AND INVENTED CERTAIN BROAD AND FUNDAMENTAL SYSTEMS OF DISTRIBUTION OF CURRENT WITH ALL THE ESSENTIAL DEVICES OF DETAIL NECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL OPERATION
ALTHOUGH HE WAS A SCOTCHMAN HE LAUGHED IMMODERATELY

ARE YOU THE MANAGER OF THIS ELECTRIC-LIGHT PLANT CHINNOCK SAID
THE WHEEL W CONTROLS THE SUPPLY OF CURRENT TO THE PRESS-MAGNET AND THE WHEEL W TO THE TYPE-MAGNET
A DESCRIPTION OF THE MANY DEVICES IN EACH OF THESE DIVISIONS WOULD REQUIRE MORE SPACE THAN IS AVAILABLE
WARD LEONARD INSTALLED THE METERS AND BECAME METER MAN IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT STUDY IN EVERY INTIMATE DETAIL THE IMPROVEMENTS AND REFINEMENTS NECESSARY IN THAT BRANCH OF THE INDUSTRY
THE ROLLS WERE WELL NAMED FOR WITH EAR-SPLITTING NOISE THEY BROKE UP IN A FEW SECONDS THE GREAT PIECES OF ROCK TOSSED IN FROM THE SKIPS
WE SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DIGEST THE FORTY-SIX PATENTS ABOVE NAMED NOR TO FOLLOW EDISON THROUGH THE PROGRESSIVE STEPS WHICH LED TO THE COMPLETION OF HIS UNIVERSAL PRINTER BUT SHALL SIMPLY PRESENT A SKETCH OF THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF AND FOLLOW WITH A VERY BRIEF AND GENERAL EXPLANATION OF ITS THEORY
AT FIRST FIVE LINES WERE USED TO CARRY THESE IMPULSES TO THE RECEIVING INSTRUMENT WHERE THERE WERE FIVE IRON PINS IMPINGING ON THE DRUM

AT THE END OF THE ROAD WAS A RICH PRIZE BELONGING RIGHTFULLY TO THE MAN WHO HAD OPENED A WAY TO IT BUT THE STRUGGLES OF OTHERS TO REACH IT BY MORE OR LESS HONEST METHODS NOW BEGAN AND CONTINUED FOR MANY YEARS
WHILE IF THEY WERE INSERTED IN MULTIPLE ARC THE LIGHT DIMINISHED AS THE CUBE OF THE NUMBER IN CIRCUIT
WITH ONE SMALL SATCHEL OF CLOTHES THREE LARGE BOXES OF INSTRUMENTS AND A BRIGHT FELLOW-TELEGRAPHER NAMED JACK WRIGHT HE TOOK VOYAGE ON THE JUMPING JAVA AS SHE WAS HUMOROUSLY KNOWN OF THE CUNARD LINE
A STILL FURTHER ECONOMY IN COST OF CONDUCTORS WAS EFFECTED BY THE THREE-WIRE INVENTION BY THE USE OF WHICH THE ALREADY DIMINISHED CONDUCTORS COULD BE STILL FURTHER REDUCED TO ONE-THIRD OF THIS SMALLER SIZE AND AT THE SAME TIME ALLOW OF THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE STATION WITH FAR BETTER RESULTS THAN IF IT WERE OPERATED EXACTLY AS AT FIRST CONCEIVED
I SAT DOWN UNSUSPICIOUSLY AT THE TABLE AND THE NEW YORK MAN STARTED SLOWLY
IN THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE MOLDS THERE ARE PLACED STEEL RODS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REINFORCEMENT
THE POLES OF THE ELECTROMAGNET IN THE LOCAL CIRCUIT ARE HOLLOWED OUT AND FILLED UP WITH CARBON DISKS OR POWDERED PLUMBAGO
HE PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE THE SLOW AND EXPENSIVE METHOD OF BREAKING LARGE BOULDERS MANUALLY AND TO SUBSTITUTE THEREFOR MOMENTUM AND KINETIC ENERGY APPLIED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF MASSIVE MACHINERY WHICH IN A FEW SECONDS WOULD BREAK INTO SMALL PIECES A ROCK AS BIG AS AN ORDINARY UPRIGHT COTTAGE PIANO AND WEIGHING AS MUCH AS SIX TONS
AT ANOTHER TIME TWO OF HIS COMPANIONS SHARING THE TEMPORARY HOSPITALITY OF HIS ROOM SMASHED MOST OF THE FURNITURE AND WENT TO BED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON
ABOUT THAT TIME MR ANDREWS AND I CAME TOGETHER
WHILE IN JANUARY OF 1878 THE BELL TELEPHONE CENTRAL-OFFICE SYSTEM AT NEW HAVEN CONNECTICUT WAS OPENED FOR BUSINESS THE FIRST FULLY EQUIPPED COMMERCIAL TELEPHONE EXCHANGE EVER ESTABLISHED FOR PUBLIC OR GENERAL SERVICE ALL THROUGH THIS FORMATIVE PERIOD BELL HAD ADHERED TO AND INTRODUCED THE MAGNETO FORM OF TELEPHONE NOW USED ONLY AS A RECEIVER AND VERY POORLY ADAPTED FOR THE VITAL FUNCTION OF A SPEECH-TRANSMITTER
ONE TYPICAL TRAGIC SCENE WAS THAT IN NEW YORK WHERE WITHIN SIGHT OF THE CITY HALL A LINEMAN WAS KILLED AT HIS WORK ON THE ARC LIGHT POLE AND HIS BODY SLOWLY ROASTED BEFORE THE GAZE OF THE EXCITED POPULACE WHICH FOR DAYS AFTERWARD DROPPED ITS SILVER AND COPPER COIN INTO THE ALMS-BOX NAILED TO THE FATAL POLE FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS FAMILY
HIS INDICATORS WERE SMALL OBLONG BOXES IN THE FRONT OF WHICH WAS A LONG SLOT ALLOWING THE DIALS AS THEY TRAVELLED PAST INSIDE TO SHOW THE NUMERALS CONSTITUTING THE QUOTATION
IF THE AUTHORS WERE ASKED AFTER HAVING WRITTEN THE FOREGOING PAGES TO EXPLAIN HERE THE REASON FOR EDISON'S SUCCESS BASED UPON THEIR OBSERVATIONS SO FAR MADE THEY WOULD FIRST ANSWER THAT HE COMBINES WITH A VIGOROUS AND NORMAL PHYSICAL STRUCTURE A MIND CAPABLE OF CLEAR AND LOGICAL THINKING AND AN IMAGINATION OF UNUSUAL ACTIVITY
THIS TIME IT WAS THE TELEPHONE
26 1876 200,032 SYNCHRONOUS MOVEMENTS FOR ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHS OCT
THE CURSE OF THIS WORK AND OF ALL THAT SUCCEEDED IT FOR A SCORE OF YEARS WAS THE NECESSITY OF DEPENDING UPON CHEMICAL BATTERIES FOR CURRENT THE MACHINE USUALLY BEING SELF-CONTAINED AND HAULING THE BATTERIES ALONG WITH ITSELF AS IN THE CASE OF THE FAMOUS PAGE EXPERIMENTS IN APRIL 1851 WHEN A SPEED OF NINETEEN MILES AN HOUR WAS ATTAINED ON THE LINE OF THE WASHINGTON BALTIMORE ROAD
WHEN THIS SPARRING PARTNER CAME TO FACE CORBETT IN THE IMITATION RING HE WAS SO PARALYZED WITH TERROR HE COULD HARDLY MOVE
ASHLEY BECAME A PARTNER IN THE FIRM AND NOT ALTOGETHER A SLEEPING ONE WHEN IT CAME TO A DIVISION OF PROFITS WHICH AT TIMES WERE CONSIDERABLE
SUCH PURSUITS AS THESE CONSUMED THE SCANT POCKET-MONEY OF THE BOY VERY RAPIDLY
FROM THE CRUDE BEGINNINGS THROUGH ALL THE VARIED PHASES OF THIS EVOLUTION THE OPERATIONS OF A MASTER MIND ARE APPARENT FROM THE CONTENTS OF THESE PAGES IN WHICH ARE RECORDED THE INNUMERABLE EXPERIMENTS CALCULATIONS AND TESTS THAT ULTIMATELY BROUGHT LIGHT OUT OF DARKNESS

PLAIN OF ASPECT BEING MERELY A SPACE BOARDED OFF WITH TONGUED-AND-GROOVED PLANKS--AS ALL THE OTHER ROOMS ARE--WITHOUT ORNAMENT OR FLOOR COVERING AND CONTAINING ONLY A FEW ARTICLES OF CHEAP FURNITURE THIS ROOM SEEMS TO EXERCISE A NAMELESS CHARM FOR HIM
IN A SENSE THIS IS TRUE FOR NO ONE IS MORE IMPATIENT OR INTOLERANT OF INTERRUPTION WHEN DEEPLY ENGAGED IN SOME LINE OF EXPERIMENT
AND THAT THE OLD FEUD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT

FREQUENTLY WHEN IT WOULD SEEM TO OTHERS THAT THE EXTREME END OF AN APPARENTLY BLIND ALLEY HAD BEEN REACHED AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED FURTHER HE HAS SHOWN THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL WAYS OUT OF IT
WITHIN A SHORT TIME HOWEVER IT WAS DEEMED DESIRABLE TO SUPPLY THE UNDERGROUND NETWORK WITH MORE CURRENT AS MANY ADDITIONAL CUSTOMERS HAD BEEN CONNECTED AND THE DEMAND FOR THE NEW LIGHT WAS INCREASING VERY RAPIDLY
ON ONE OCCASION EDISON ACTED AS TREASURER FOR HIS BIBULOUS COMPANIONS HOLDING THE STAKES SO TO SPEAK IN ORDER THAT THE SUPPLY OF LIQUOR MIGHT LAST LONGER
BUT THE RECORD CAN ONLY BE PHOTOGRAPHIC
IT IS NO WONDER THAT SUCH IMPATIENCE SUCH AN ENTHUSIASM DROVE THE WORK FORWARD AT A HEADLONG PACE
THEY LEFT NEW YORK IN SEPTEMBER 1887 ARRIVING IN DUE TIME AT PARA PROCEEDING THENCE TWENTY-THREE HUNDRED MILES UP THE AMAZON RIVER TO IQUITOS
THIS INVENTION SWEPT AWAY THE TREE AND OTHER SYSTEMS AND AT ONE BOUND BROUGHT INTO BEING THE POSSIBILITY OF EFFECTIVELY DISTRIBUTING LARGE CURRENTS OVER EXTENDED AREAS WITH A COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE INVESTMENT FOR COPPER
BUT BOTH WERE PRACTICABLE AND SERVICEABLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF HAULING PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT
I WENT TO WORK ON MY REGULAR DAY WIRE TO PORTSMOUTH OHIO AND THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT BUT NOTHING WAS SAID TO ME NEITHER DID MR STEVENS EXAMINE THE COPY ON THE OFFICE HOOK WHICH I WAS WATCHING WITH GREAT INTEREST
ON THE SUCCEEDING DAY THE RED ROACH WAS RESTORED AND THE PICKEREL HAD FORGOTTEN THE IMPRESSIONS OF THE FIRST DAY AND HE REPEATED THIS AGAIN
TO EDISON HOWEVER NO TRACE OF SENTIMENT OR REGRET OCCURRED AND THE WHOLE RUINS WERE APPARENTLY AS MUCH A MATTER OF UNCONCERN AS IF HE WERE VIEWING THE REMAINS OF POMPEII
HAMMER MARTIN FORCE LUDWIG K
SEEN IN THE RETROSPECT THE STRUGGLE FOR THE GOAL AT THIS MOMENT WAS ONE OF THE MEMORABLE INCIDENTS IN ELECTRICAL HISTORY
THE COMING OF THE AUTOMOBILE WAS A GREAT BOON TO HIM BECAUSE IT GAVE HIM A FORM OF OUTDOOR SPORT IN WHICH HE COULD INDULGE IN A SPIRIT OF OBSERVATION WITHOUT THE GUILTY FEELING THAT HE WAS WASTING VALUABLE TIME
THESE REMARKS APPLY MORE PARTICULARLY TO WHAT MAY BE TERMED IN GENERAL CIRCUIT METERS
AND THESE SERVE TO SUPPLEMENT THE MAIN NARRATIVE BY THROWING VIVID SIDE-LIGHTS ON THE WHOLE SCENE
A PATENT DECISION IN FAVOR OF EDISON
DIFFICULTIES ARE MULTIPLIED WHEN WE PAUSE FOR A MOMENT TO THINK OF EDISON'S INFLUENCE ON COLLATERAL BRANCHES OF BUSINESS
BUT WHILE THEY WERE WITH EDISON IT WAS WITH HIS WORK THAT THEY WERE AND MUST BE BUSIED
FOR INSTANCE WHEN HE CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF POURING A COMPLETE CONCRETE HOUSE IT WAS UNIVERSALLY HELD THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE PIECES OF STONE IN THE MIXTURE WOULD NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF THE POURING-POINT BUT WOULD GRAVITATE TO A LOWER PLANE IN THE SOFT CEMENT
EVERYTHING WORKED TO A CHARM UNTIL IN STARTING UP AT ONE END OF THE ROAD THE FRICTION GEARING WAS BROUGHT INTO ACTION TOO SUDDENLY AND IT WAS WRECKED
WHEN THE MOTOR WAS STARTED THE ARMATURE WAS BROUGHT UP TO FULL REVOLUTION AND THEN THE BELT WAS TIGHTENED ON THE CAR-AXLE COMPELLING MOTION OF THE LOCOMOTIVE
IN THE STORY OF THE ORE-MILLING WORK IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT THE PLANT WAS SHUT DOWN OWING TO THE COMPETITION OF THE CHEAP ORE FROM THE MESABA RANGE
EDISON WAS FORTUNATE IN BEING REPRESENTED BY A MAN WITH SO MUCH ADDRESS INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT AND POWERS OF EXPLANATION
SIMS AND HE UNDERTOOK TO BUILD AN ENGINE TO RUN AT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY REVOLUTIONS AND GIVE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE HORSE-POWER
INTO THIS THERE IS DELIVERED BY THE ENDLESS CHAIN OF BUCKETS SHOWN ON THE LEFT A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF A SPECIAL FREE-FLOWING CONCRETE MIXTURE
AS FOR INSTANCE IF ONE HORSE-POWER WILL HEAT TWELVE INCHES OF WIRE TO 1000 DEGREES FAHR AND THIS IS CONCENTRATED TO HAVE ONE-QUARTER OF THE RADIATING SURFACE IT WOULD REACH A TEMPERATURE OF 4000 DEGREES OR SUFFICIENT TO MELT IT
EDISON'S GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO THE REGULAR STAGE WAS THE INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP WHICH ENABLED THE PRODUCTION OF SCENIC EFFECTS NEVER BEFORE EVEN DREAMED OF BUT WHICH WE ACCEPT NOW WITH SO MUCH COMPLACENCY
26 1882 317,633 INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS
FROM ALL THAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOVE IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT EDISON'S REAL AND REMARKABLE CAPACITY FOR BUSINESS DOES NOT LIE IN ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF NOR IN THE DIRECTION OF ROUTINE OFFICE PRACTICE NOR EVEN IN ORDINARY ADMINISTRATIVE AFFAIRS
AFTER THIS DYNAMO WAS SHIPPED TO FRANCE AND ITS SUCCESSORS TO ENGLAND FOR THE HOLBORN VIADUCT PLANT EDISON MADE STILL FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN DESIGN INCREASING CAPACITY AND ECONOMY AND THEN PROCEEDED VIGOROUSLY WITH SIX MACHINES FOR PEARL STREET
THE FIELD-POLES WERE 33 3/4 INCHES LONG AND 27 1/2 INCHES INSIDE DIAMETER THE ARMATURE WINDING CONSISTED OF 146 COPPER BARS ON THE FACE OF THE CORE CONNECTED INTO A CLOSED-COIL WINDING BY MEANS OF 73 COPPER DISKS AT EACH END OF THE CORE

AT MENLO PARK ONE COLD WINTER NIGHT THERE CAME INTO THE LABORATORY A STRANGE MAN IN A MOST PITIFUL CONDITION
THIS DEVICE IS KNOWN AS AN ELECTROMAGNET AND THE CHARGING AND DISCHARGING OF SUCH A MAGNET MAY OF COURSE BE REPEATED INDEFINITELY
NO ONE LINE OF INVESTIGATION HAS EVER BEEN ENOUGH TO OCCUPY HIS THOUGHTS FULLY
HE DID NOT HOWEVER NEGLECT CHEMISTRY BUT INDULGED HIS TASTES IN THAT DIRECTION FREELY ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO RECORD THAT THIS WORK WAS ANYTHING MORE AT THAT TIME THAN THE CARRYING OUT OF EXPERIMENTS OUTLINED IN THE BOOKS
IT SHOULD BE STATED HOWEVER THAT BETWEEN THE OUTLINE AND THE FILLING IN OF THE DETAILS THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HARD WORK STUDY PATIENT PLODDING AND ENDLESS EXPERIMENTS BEFORE EDISON FINALLY PERFECTED HIS QUADRUPLEX SYSTEM IN THE YEAR 1874
BRAUNER THEN RESIDING IN BROOKLYN NEW YORK HAD AN EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF INDIGENOUS PLANTS OF THE PARTICULAR KIND DESIRED
BUT GOULD NEVER SMILED ONCE THE FORMATION OF THE EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY INVOLVED THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE IMMEDIATE EDISON MANUFACTURING INTERESTS IN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER WITH A CAPITALIZATION OF $12,000,000 NOW A RELATIVELY MODEST SUM
SEVERAL PERSONS COULD OBTAIN SPARKS FROM THE GAS-PIPES AT ONCE EACH SPARK BEING EQUAL IN VOLUME AND BRILLIANCY TO THE SPARK DRAWN BY A SINGLE PERSON

NO OTHER ARRANGEMENT COULD POSSIBLY BE CONSIDERED AS COMMERCIALLY PRACTICABLE
SCOTT SIMS WHO SOUGHT HIS CO-OPERATION
THE TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT WAS PUT IN THE HANDS OF HAMILTON MCK
THIS MADE THE TELEPHONE COMMERCIAL AS THE MAGNETO TELEPHONE RECEIVER OF BELL WAS TOO WEAK TO BE USED AS A TRANSMITTER COMMERCIALLY
THIS CONGEALS ON THE RECORD SURFACE JUST AS MELTED BUTTER WOULD COLLECT ON A COLD KNIFE AND WHEN THE MOLD IS REMOVED THE SURPLUS WAX FALLS OUT LEAVING A HEAVY DEPOSIT OF THE MATERIAL WHICH FORMS THE DUPLICATE RECORD

THESE MATERIALS WHEN MIXED BECAME A FRIABLE MASS WHICH HE HAD FOUND COULD BE BROUGHT INTO SUCH A COHESIVE PUTTY-LIKE STATE BY MANIPULATION AS TO BE CAPABLE OF BEING ROLLED OUT INTO FILAMENTS AS FINE AS SEVEN-THOUSANDTHS OF AN INCH IN CROSS-SECTION
MOORE OF RAHWAY NEW JERSEY WHO LEFT NEW YORK IN THE SUMMER OF 1880 BOUND FOR CHINA AND JAPAN THESE BEING THE COUNTRIES PREEMINENTLY NOTED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ABUNDANT SPECIES OF BAMBOO
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PROBLEMS OF A MECHANICAL NATURE I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT ALL I'VE EVER TACKLED AND SOLVED HAVE BEEN DONE BY HARD LOGICAL THINKING THE INTENSE EARNESTNESS AND EMPHASIS WITH WHICH THIS WAS SAID WERE VERY IMPRESSIVE TO THE AUDITORS
COMING NOW TO THE ORANGE VALLEY PLANT WE TAKE A DROP FROM THESE FIGURES TO THE COMPARATIVELY MODEST ONES WHICH GIVE US AN AVERAGE OF 3600 EMPLOYEES AND CALLING FOR AN ANNUAL PAY-ROLL OF ABOUT $2,250,000
WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE WORKS ON MONDAY MORNING HE TOOK WITH HIM SKETCHES HE HAD MADE SHOWING FORTY-EIGHT OTHER WAYS OF ACCOMPLISHING THE DESIRED OPERATION AND LAID THEM ON THE ENGINEER'S DESK WITHOUT A WORD
MR ORTON AND W
WE HAD AN ARMINGTON SIMS ENGINE WITH SIGHT-FEED OILER
THIS I DID AND IN THE MEAN TIME A SET OF SUITABLE TOOLS FOR THIS PURPOSE HAD BEEN ORDERED TO BE MADE IN THE LABORATORY
AT THE TIME OF THIS WRITING THESE SPECIMENS CONSIST LARGELY OF SECTIONS OF POSITIVE ELEMENTS OF THE STORAGE BATTERY TOGETHER WITH MANY SAMPLES OF NICKEL HYDRATE TO WHICH EDISON DEVOTES DEEP STUDY
IN 1876 I STARTED AGAIN TO EXPERIMENT FOR THE WESTERN UNION AND MR ORTON
WE HAD TO TAKE THE WHOLE INSTALLATION OUT
THE FACT THAT THIRTEEN YEARS HAD ELAPSED GIVES A VIVID IDEA OF THE ORDEAL INVOLVED IN SUSTAINING A PATENT AND THE INJUSTICE TO THE INVENTOR WHILE THERE IS OBVIOUSLY HARDSHIP TO THOSE WHO CANNOT TELL FROM ANY DECISION OF THE COURT WHETHER THEY ARE INFRINGING OR NOT
WE RECEIVED NUMEROUS TELEPHONE MESSAGES ABOUT IT
THUS AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR IN THE LIFE OF THIS IMPORTANT PATENT AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF COSTLY LITIGATION EDISON AND HIS ASSOCIATES WERE COMPELLED TO ASSUME THE DEFENSIVE AGAINST A CLAIMANT WHOSE UTTERLY BASELESS PRETENSIONS HAD ALREADY BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED AND REJECTED YEARS BEFORE BY EVERY INTERESTED PARTY AND ULTIMATELY ON EXAMINATION BY THE COURTS PRONOUNCED LEGALLY UNTENABLE IF NOT INDEED ACTUALLY FRAUDULENT
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE IN THE ROOM EXCEPT A COUPLE OF WALNUT ROLLER-TOP DESKS--WHICH WERE VERY GENERALLY USED IN AMERICAN OFFICES AT THAT TIME
AS THE POWER IS APPLIED TO THE ROLLS THROUGH SLIPPING FRICTION-CLUTCHES THE SPEED OF THE DRIVING-PULLEYS IS NOT MATERIALLY REDUCED
EDISON'S ORE-SEPARATION WORK HAS BEEN ALREADY FULLY DESCRIBED BUT THE STORY WOULD HARDLY BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A REFERENCE TO SIMILAR WORK IN GOLD EXTRACTION DATING BACK TO THE MENLO PARK DAYS
IN PUBLISHING A PORTRAIT OF EDISON THIS YEAR ONE OF THE POPULAR MAGAZINES PLACED UNDER IT THIS CAPTION
GOOD-MORNING I WENT OUT VERY MUCH CRESTFALLEN THINKING I WOULD BE DELAYED AND HARASSED IN THE WORK WHICH I WAS ANXIOUS TO FINISH AND WAS DOING NIGHT AND DAY
THE RESULT OF THE OPERATION OF THESE TWO FORCES ACTING UPON IT WHOLLY FROM WITHOUT AND FROM A RIVAL IT WAS DESIRED TO CRUSH HAS BEEN TO INCREASE ENORMOUSLY THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF GAS IN THE LAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS
1 1889 430,277 AUTOMATIC DETERMINING DEVICE FOR PHONOGRAPHS
I BELIEVE I CAN MAKE A KILN WHICH WILL GIVE AN OUTPUT OF ONE THOUSAND BARRELS IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS ALTHOUGH I HAD THEN BEEN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH HIM FOR TEN YEARS AND WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS I COULD NOT HELP FEELING THE IMPROBABILITY OF HIS BEING ABLE TO JUMP INTO AN OLD-ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY--AS A NOVICE--AND START BY IMPROVING THE HEART OF THE PRODUCTION SO AS TO INCREASE ITS CAPACITY 400 PER CENT
JUNE 24 1881 251,537 DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE
AT THAT MOMENT EDISON STRIPPED PRETTY NEARLY DOWN TO THE BUFF WAS AT THE VERY CRISIS OF AN IMPORTANT EXPERIMENT AND REFUSED ABSOLUTELY TO BE INTERRUPTED
THE IMPROVED FORM IS THE GENERAL TYPE SO WELL KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AND SOLD AT THE PRESENT DAY--VIZ THE SPRING OR ELECTRIC MOTOR-DRIVEN MACHINE WITH THE CYLINDRICAL WAX RECORD--IN FACT THE REGULATION EDISON PHONOGRAPH
THE IDEA OF A COMPLETE SYSTEM HAD BEEN IN HIS MIND IN BROAD OUTLINE FOR A LONG TIME BUT DID NOT CRYSTALLIZE INTO COMMERCIAL FORM UNTIL THE INCANDESCENT LAMP WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT
ALL EXPERT TESTIMONY POINTED TO THE FACT THAT A MIXTURE OF CONCRETE CEMENT SAND CRUSHED STONE AND WATER COULD NOT BE MADE TO FLOW FREELY TO THE SMALLEST PARTS OF AN INTRICATE SET OF MOLDS
SPRAGUE IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER BUT BEST ILLUSTRATED IN THE PERFECTION OF THE MODERN HIGH-SPEED ENGINE OF THE ARMINGTON SIMS TYPE
THE PEARL STREET STATION WAS OPERATED FOR SOME TIME SUBSEQUENT TO THE FIRE BUT INCREASING DEMANDS IN THE MEAN TIME HAVING LED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF OTHER STATIONS THE MAINS OF THE FIRST DISTRICT WERE SOON AFTERWARD CONNECTED TO ANOTHER PLANT THE PEARL STREET STATION WAS DISMANTLED AND THE BUILDING WAS SOLD IN 1895
BY AN INGENIOUS ARRANGEMENT OF THE MECHANISM THE FILM MOVES INTERMITTENTLY SO THAT IT MAY HAVE A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF REST THAN OF MOTION
THE SYSTEM WILL PERHAPS BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD BY REFERENCE TO THE FOLLOWING DIAGRAMMATIC SKETCH OF ITS GENERAL PRINCIPLES
THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE EARLIER MACHINES ARE MINUTELY SET FORTH AND THE WITNESSES FOR THE PLAINTIFF ARE CLEAR THAT THEY ARE NEITHER PRACTICAL NOR PROFITABLE
THERE WERE NO ELECTRIC MOTORS EVEN FOR STATIONARY PURPOSES EXCEPT FREAKS BUILT FOR EXPERIMENTAL USES
HE HAD A WOODEN MODEL MADE AND STUDIED IT VERY CAREFULLY THROUGH A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS
THEY PICNICKED IN THE GROVE AND SIX HUNDRED OF THEM WENT UP THE TOWER

THROUGH AN INTRODUCTION FROM MR JAY GOULD WHO THEN CONTROLLED THE UNION PACIFIC EDISON WAS ALLOWED TO RIDE ON THE COW-CATCHERS OF THE LOCOMOTIVES
HOW IS THE WHISKEY MAN GETTING ALONG IT'S ALL RIGHT
ONE OF THESE EARLY EXHIBITIONS IS DESCRIBED IN THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN OF JUNE 5 1880
GOING ALONG THE DOCK I SAW TWO SMALL SMOKESTACKS STICKING UP AND LOOKING DOWN SAW A LITTLE BOAT
THIS TREATMENT IS DEVOTED TO ONE MAN WHOM HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS HAVE CHOSEN TO REGARD AS IN MANY WAYS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AMERICAN AT HIS FINEST FLOWERING IN THE FIELD OF INVENTION DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
HOOD WRIGHT E
LET US THEREFORE SET DOWN BRIEFLY A FEW OF THE LEADING ITEMS NEEDED FOR PERFECT ILLUMINATION BY ELECTRICITY ALL OF WHICH WERE PART OF THE EDISON PROGRAMME
AND BY SO ARRANGING THE RECEIVING APPARATUS AS NOT TO BE AFFECTED BY THE CURRENTS TRANSMITTED FROM ITS OWN END OF THE LINE
BEFORE HE BEGAN INVENTING ONLY TWO OF THEM WERE KNOWN AT ALL AS ARTS--TELEGRAPHY AND THE MANUFACTURE OF CEMENT
WHATEVER MAY BE THE MENTAL PROCESSES BY WHICH HE ARRIVES AT THE STARTING-POINT OF ANY SPECIFIC LINE OF RESEARCH THE FINAL RESULTS ALMOST INVARIABLY PROVE THAT HE DOES NOT PLUNGE IN AT RANDOM
I ADJUSTED THE REPRODUCER AND THE MACHINE REPRODUCED IT PERFECTLY
HOW WOULD $40,000 STRIKE YOU THIS CAUSED ME TO COME AS NEAR FAINTING AS I EVER GOT
FORTUNATELY NO SUCH CATASTROPHE HAPPENED BUT YOUNG EDISON WORKED AWAY IN HIS EMBRYONIC LABORATORY SATISFYING HIS SOUL AND INCIDENTALLY DEPLETING HIS LIMITED POCKET-MONEY TO THE VANISHING-POINT
WHEN HE CAME IN HE WAS INTRODUCED
THERE WAS STRAW IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT WHICH WE ALL SLEPT ON
BEFORE STARTING THE PLANT FOR REGULAR COMMERCIAL SERVICE HE BEGAN PERSONALLY A SERIES OF PRACTICAL EXPERIMENTS AND TESTS TO ASCERTAIN IN ADVANCE WHAT DIFFICULTIES WOULD ACTUALLY ARISE IN PRACTICE SO THAT HE COULD PROVIDE REMEDIES OR PREVENTIVES
THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO QUESTION AS TO THE RESULT OBTAINED AT THE MOMENT WHICH WAS ALL THAT WAS ASKED
AFTER OUTLINING THE DUTIES OF THE METER MAN EDISON SAYS
BARKER CABLED AS FOLLOWS FROM PARIS ANNOUNCING THE DECISION OF THE EXPERT JURY WHICH PASSED UPON THE EXHIBITS
BY A COMBINATION OF THE NEUTRAL RELAY AND THE POLAR RELAY TWO OPERATORS BY MANIPULATING TWO TELEGRAPH KEYS IN THE ORDINARY WAY CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY SEND TWO MESSAGES OVER ONE LINE IN THE SAME DIRECTION WITH THE SAME CURRENT ONE OPERATOR VARYING ITS STRENGTH AND THE OTHER OPERATOR VARYING ITS POLARITY OR DIRECTION OF FLOW
THE MAKING OF A PERFECT ORIGINAL MUSICAL OR OTHER RECORD IS A MATTER OF NO SMALL DIFFICULTY AS IT REQUIRES SPECIAL TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL GATHERED FROM MANY YEARS OF ACTUAL EXPERIENCE
MY APPARATUS WAS ENTIRELY TOO SENSITIVE AND I GOT NO RESULTS IT WAS FOUND THAT THE HEAT FROM THE CORONA OF THE SUN WAS TEN TIMES THE INDEX CAPACITY OF THE INSTRUMENT
12 1882 395,962 MANUFACTURING ELECTRIC LAMPS SEPT
THIRTY YEARS BRING ABOUT GREAT CHANGES ESPECIALLY IN A FIELD SO NOTABLY PROGRESSIVE AS THAT OF THE GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY
AFTER THAT TIME THE WORK OF TAKING AWAY THE MOLDS IS BEGUN
OUR ACTIVE POLICY OF THE PACIFIC DATED FROM THAT HOUR
SO THAT THIS WRETCHED MAN WATCHED MORE CLOSELY THAN EVER WAS ANY MALEFACTOR CANNOT EVEN GIVE A MOMENT'S THOUGHT TO HIS OWN PRIVATE AFFAIRS WITHOUT ONE OF HIS GUARDS ASKING HIM WHAT HE IS THINKING ABOUT THIS FOOLISH BLAGUE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A DESCRIPTION OF EDISON'S NEW AEROPHONE A STEAM MACHINE WHICH CARRIED THE VOICE A DISTANCE OF ONE AND A HALF MILES
NOR HAD HE FORGOTTEN THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE PICKED UP AS A BOY ON THE LOCOMOTIVES OF THE GRAND TRUNK ROAD
NEARLY EVERY NIGHT WE WOULD HEAR A CALL SUCH AS CORPORAL OF THE GUARD NO
THIS SHOP WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL BOTH SCIENTIFICALLY AND FINANCIALLY

AND YET WHEN THE CULPRIT LIKE A BAD SCHOOL-BOY HAS LEFT THE ROOM EDISON HAS IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO HIS NORMAL POISE AND THE INCIDENT IS A THING OF THE PAST
EDISON WAS GIVEN A WIRE AND BATTERIES TO OPERATE WITH BUT A PRELIMINARY TEST SOON SHOWED THAT HE WAS GOING TO FAIL
19 1881 248,418 ELECTRIC LAMP
I FILLED IN A PARAGRAPH ABOUT THE CONVENTION AND HOW THE VOTE HAD GONE AS I WAS SURE IT WOULD
IT IS EXACTLY LIKE THE PRIMARY BATTERY IN THE FUNDAMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ITS ABILITY FOR GENERATING ELECTRIC CURRENT DEPENDS UPON CHEMICAL ACTION
AND OTHER DETAILS TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION SUCH AS RELATED TO THE GAS ITSELF THE SATISFACTION OF THE CUSTOMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF DAY AND NIGHT DEMAND
EVEN IN 1847 FEW OF THESE THINGS HAD LOST THEIR NOVELTY MOST OF THEM WERE IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT
AT 7 O'CLOCK THE DAY MEN BEGAN TO APPEAR
AT ANOTHER TIME I HAD A BRIQUETTING MACHINE FOR BRIQUETTING IRON ORE
THE HISTORY OF HIS CAREER HAS THEREFORE FALLEN NATURALLY INTO A SERIES OF CHAPTERS EACH AIMING TO DESCRIBE SOME PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT OR ART
ADJACENT TO THESE ROOMS ARE SEVERAL OTHERS DEVOTED TO PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL EXPERIMENTS TOGETHER WITH A DRAUGHTING-ROOM
THE RIVERS IN SOUTHERN CHINA BROUGHT DOWN TO CANTON BAMBOOS OF MANY SPECIES WHERE THIS WONDROUSLY UTILITARIAN REED ENTERS VERY LARGELY INTO THE INDUSTRIAL LIFE OF THAT PEOPLE AND NOT MERELY INTO THE INDUSTRIAL LIFE BUT EVEN INTO THE CULINARY ARTS FOR BAMBOO SPROUTS ARE A UNIVERSAL VEGETABLE IN CHINA
HE MAY CHANGE THE LINE OF ATTACK
THE ECONOMY OF THIS IS APPARENT WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IN OTHER CEMENT PLANTS THE LIMIT OF CRUSHING ABILITY IS ONE-MAN SIZE"--THAT IS PIECES NOT TOO LARGE FOR ONE MAN TO LIFT
MR RICALTON'S OWN STORY OF HIS MEMORABLE EXPEDITION IS SO INTERESTING AS TO BE WORTHY OF REPETITION HERE
AN IMMENSE BUILDING OF GLASS WITH ALL THE PROPERTIES AND STAGE-SETTINGS OF A REGULAR THEATRE IS REQUIRED
EDISON REPLIED THAT HE INTENDED TO DO THAT HIMSELF AND INVITED MR MALLORY TO GO WITH HIM TO ONE OF THE DRAUGHTING-ROOMS ON AN UPPER FLOOR OF THE LABORATORY
ONE OF THE MEN WENT BACK AND MOLLIFIED HIM
AS FAR BACK AS 1692 HOUGHTON ISSUED IN LONDON A WEEKLY REVIEW OF FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS UPON WHICH MACAULAY BASED THE LIVELY NARRATIVE OF STOCK SPECULATION IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY GIVEN IN HIS FAMOUS HISTORY
THEY FOUND A ROADSIDE INN AND BY MEANS OF SNOWSHOES ALL THE PASSENGERS WERE TAKEN TO THE INN
LICENSEES UNDER EDISON PATENTS IN THIS COUNTRY ALONE PRODUCE UPWARD OF 60,000,000 FEET OF FILMS ANNUALLY CONTAINING MORE THAN A BILLION AND A HALF SEPARATE PHOTOGRAPHS
BUT THE BELTS WERE LIABLE TO SLIP A GREAT DEAL IN THE PROCESS AND THE CHAFING OF THE BELTS CHARRED THEM BADLY
HE LOOKED LIKE A BAD MAN THE RIM OF HIS EAR ALL AROUND CAME TO A SHARP EDGE AND WAS SERRATED
THE METER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING 1899 AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
THE A TYPE EDISON CELL IS THE OUTCOME OF NINE YEARS OF COSTLY EXPERIMENTATION AND PERSISTENT TOIL ON THE PART OF ITS INVENTOR AND HIS ASSOCIATES
THIS WE HAVE NOTICED OFTEN IN RELAYS IN STOCK-PRINTERS WHEN THERE WERE A LITTLE IRON FILINGS BETWEEN THE ARMATURE AND CORE AND MORE OFTEN IN OUR NEW ELECTRIC PEN AND WE HAVE ALWAYS COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY STRONG INDUCTION
