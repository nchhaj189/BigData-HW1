AND HOSTS OF GLAD-VOICED ANGELS SING IN THE RIPPLING GROVES OF SPRING
IN THIS HEART BREATHES PURER AIR THE THOUGHTS THAT MOVE ACROSS THIS SKY HAVE HAD A MORE MYSTERIOUS BIRTH ARE LOVELIER FLOAT MORE STATELILY THAN CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY OF EARTH ALL GUESTS WITHIN THAT HEART'S DEEP WOOD ALL FRIENDS TOGETHER IN THAT HOUSE HIGH CONVERSE HELD WITH AN AERIAL BROOD WITH SPIRIT-FOLK KEPT DELICATE CAROUSE
NOR IS THERE ANY MOURNFUL GHOST TO WAIL UNTIL THE NIGHT IS SPED
THE CHILD IS GONE O CRIMSON ROSE AND STAINED AND HARDENED ARE THE HANDS AND WHO SHALL FIND YOUR GOLDEN HEART AND WHO SHALL KISS YOUR WITHERED SOUL
O GOLDEN HEART
HELEN AGAIN THE VOICES OF THE HUNTING HORNS AND THE NEW MOON LOW LYING ON THE HILLS TELL THAT THE SUMMER NIGHT IS ON ITS WAY O LANGUID HEART SHALT THOU MUCH LONGER WATCH THIS PALE PROCESSION OF THE SILENT HOURS MELT INTO SHADOWS OF UNENDING YEARS
TIME SHALL SURELY REAP AND ON DEATH'S BLADE LIE MANY A FLOWER CURLED IN OTHER LANDS WHERE OTHER SONGS BE SUNG
SO MUCH THE MORE I PRAISE IN MEASURE THE GENEROUS GODS FOR YOU MY TREASURE
SOMETIMES IN MIDNIGHT LANES I HEARD THE TWITTER OF A DARKLING BIRD AS HIDDEN FROM THE ASHEN MOON THE PATHOS OF HIS MUSIC STIRRED
I SEE THE RED MOUTH TARNISHED THE FACE GREY AND SMILELESS SILENT EYES OF MAGDALEN
CUTHBERT WRIGHT THE END OF IT WE MET AND ON THE DECOROUS DRIVE TOUCHED HANDS GOOD-BYE
THOU FROISSART FOR THAT THOU DIDST LOVE THE PEN WHILE OTHERS WROTE IN STEEL ACCEPT ALL PRAISE OF AFTER AGES AND OF HUNGERING DAYS FOR WHOM THE OLD GLORIES MOVE THE OLD TRUMPETS CRY
PROUD GRIEF HER LUSTROUS TORCH HATH LIGHTED IN THIS BRIEF DIM TIME BEFORE THE DARK WHEN THE WIDE WEST FADES WHERE ILLIMITABLE SKIES SUGGEST DAYS VANISHED IN THE BEAUTY OF BELIEF
ABOVE THE GURGLING GUTTERS HE HEARD SURELY A DOOR UNCHAINED
PURSED LIPS DO BLOW UPON COOL FLUTES WITHIN WIDE GLOOMS AND SING OF HARPS CELESTIAL TO THE QUIVERING STRING INVISIBLE FACES HAUNTINGLY AND SLOW
THEY KNEW ERE I HAD HALF DIVINED
OR ELSE THE SUBURBAN STREET GOLDEN WITH SUNLIGHT AND THE BARE BRANCHES OF ELM TREES TWINED IN THE DELICATE SKY
NAHANT LAST NIGHT THE SEA WAS AN ENCHANTED MOAN AND A PALE PATHWAY THAT THE MOONLIGHT MADE
FAR THROUGH THE VALLEYS THEY GATHER THE HARVEST
THE TREE OF STARS THERE STANDS A TREE WHERE NO MAN KNOWS AND LIKE AN EARTHLY TREE IT GROWS SAVE THAT UPON ITS BRANCHES WIDE THE EARTH AND ALL THE STARS BESIDE THE CHILLY MOON AND THE GREAT SUN THE LITTLE PLANETS ONE BY ONE ARE HUNG LIKE FRUIT TO REDDEN THERE AND RIPEN IN THE HEAVENLY AIR
GAZING WE DRIFTED TOWARD THAT GOLDEN BLOOM OF PALACES WHOSE LIGHT GLOWED ON OUR SAIL
SMITTEN BY A BARBED JOY MY SENSE WITH RAPTUROUS PAIN GREW DIM JOY PIERCED ME AS IT WOULD DESTROY
AS IN A CRYSTAL DREAMERS SEE OUT OF UNWINDING MISTS ARISE THE SPLENDORS OF SOME PARADISE WOVEN OF GOLD AND IVORY
OLD PAIN OF DEAD FAREWELLS
A WHILE IT LIES BELOW THEM IN THE HARBOUR THEN THERE GLEAMS A NEW SHAPE ON THE STAIRS UP TO THAT LAND OF DREAMS
OUT OF THE LITTLENESS OUT OF THE LITTLENESS THAT WRAPS MY DAYS THE OPPRESSIVE MIST OF GRAY AND COMMON THINGS SOMETIMES MY DREAM ON ITS AUDACIOUS WINGS DRIPPING WITH GOLDEN FIRE ABOVE THE HAZE FLASHES AND VEERS AGAINST THE SUDDEN BLAZE OF SUNLIGHT
SWIFT HATH SPED THE HOUR OF YOUTH AND YET TO HANG THE HEAD LAMENTING LOST THINGS OF DEPARTED DAYS WERE ONLY FROM THAT SHADOWLAND TO RAISE A WRAITH THAT WHISPERING OF THE QUIET DEAD WOULD MIMIC THE STRANGE LIFE OF LOVE
A WIND GUST CARRIES THE BAND'S FLARE OF SONG IN NOISY EDDIES ECHOING ROUND LONELY BLACK STREET-CORNERS TILL WITH DISTANCE DIMMING IT FADES AWAY AMONG THE SILENT DARK ARRAY OF CITY HOUSES WHERE NO SOUL STIRS
I DID BUT CHANGE MY LEAFY HUT FOR A MANSION IN THE AIR THE EERIE WOOD THE ENCHANTED GROUND THE DIM BIRD-HAUNTED GLADES WE TROD GREW ALL UNTUNEFUL WHEN I FOUND A DWELLING IN THE HEART OF GOD
ALL NIGHT IT SORROWED IN THE DARK ALONE GROPING WITH GHOSTLY FINGERS HALF AFRAID UP THE GREAT ROCKS AND SOBBING BACK AGAIN WEARY OF SEARCH YET STILL UNSATISFIED
ELEGY FOR ANTINOUS COME LET US HASTEN HENCE AND WEEP NO MORE THE SINKING SEA FLOWS ON ITS TRANQUIL WAYS NIGHT LOOMS SERENELY AT THE EASTERN DOOR AND TRAILS THE LAST CLOUD INTO LIFELESS HAZE
AND THROUGH THE BRANCHES OVERHEAD I KNOW NOT WHAT SWEET SPIRITS STRAYED OR WHAT COMMANDANT SPIRIT LED THEIR MAZY DANCES BUT ONE PLAYED SO DEFTLY ON A PSALTERY THAT THEY FOR JOY MUST NEEDS KEEP SINGING
MONOTONOUSLY THE SOLEMN REEDS WAVED TO OUR PASSING
THEN AS I LEANED ABOVE THEIR CRIMSON BLOOM THE FLOWER OF DAY GREW OLD AND WITHERED NIGHT WITH A SIGH SAT DOWN BESIDE HER LOOM WINDING HER SHUTTLE WITH A SILVER THREAD
THUS WALK I THROUGH MY WONDERLAND WHILE ALL THE EVENING IS ATUNE BENEATH THE CYPRESS TREES THAT STAND LIKE CANDLES TO THE BARREN MOON
CIRCLE THE BASKING HILLS IN FRAGRANT FLIGHT SHOUT RAPTURE
FLOWER OF MY SOUL
WE SEE THEM NOT BUT IF BY CHANCE WE STRAY DOWN CYPRESS AISLES WHEN THE WAN SUMMER DAY DRAWS TO A THIN AND SICKLY CLOSE WE HEAR MURMUR OF MAD SPEECH BY SOME WATERY WEIR OR LANGUID LAUGHTER AND FAINT SOUND OF PLAY
BUT SOON IT SINKS TO EARTH AGAIN AND HITTING HILLS IT BURSTS
THE WAN MOON HOLDS HER LANTERN HIGH AND SOFTLY THREADS WITH NODDING LIGHT THE VIOLET POSTERNS OF THE SKY BELOW THE TIDES RUN SWIFT AND BRIGHT INTO THE SEA
ALL THINGS ARE SACRED TO THAT TENDER SIGHT
THOU FLOWER OF A BOY
O HAPPY TIME
HAVE YOU DESERTED ME NOW IN THE AUTUMN
HER BLUE-VEINED BREASTS ARE NOW SUBLIME HER MOULDED TORSO GLORIOUS
THESE WERE MY GODS--AND THEN YOU CAME WITH FLOWERS CROWNED AND SUN-KISSED HAIR MAKING THIS NORTHERN RIVER SEEM SOME LAUGHTER-GIRDLED GRECIAN STREAM
THE PAINTED WINDOWS BURN AND FLAME UP THROUGH THE MUSIC-HAUNTED AIR
MY PEACE I LEAVE WITH YOU HE PONDERED LONG AND WATCHED THE DARKENING SPACE CLOSE THE RED PORTALS WHENCE THE HOURS HAD RUN AS LIKE YOUNG WISTFUL ANGELS ONE BY ONE THE STARS CAST TIMID FLOWERS ABOUT HIS FACE
DOWN THE CHEERING GREY-PAVED STREET THE FRINGED FLAGS THE ERECT FLAGS PASS
YOU ARE THE ROSE THAT CAME TO LIFE AND SPOKE
ON A STREET CORNER BUT ALL THE TIME YOU SPOKE I DID NOT HEAR THE WORDS YOU SAID
WHY DO I LINGER NOW VAINLY LAMENTING
DEEP IN THE GLOBE OF THOUGHT I SAW DAWN FROM TEMPESTUOUS DUST THAT FORM TOWARD WHICH THE ENDLESS AGES STORM UPROARIOUS--TO BREAK WITH AWE
WHO ART THOU THAT BENDEST PRAYING OVER ME WITH CLASPED PALMS
YOU DIED WITH KISSES IN YOUR HEART I LIVE WITH SORROW IN MY SOUL
AND STILL THE SENSITIVE SILHOUETTES OF THE GONDOLAS PASS AND LEAVE NO TRACK LIGHT ON THE TIDES AS LILIES AND BLACK IN THE RIPPLING WATERS OF LONG SUNSETS
THEN SAD THE MASTER BOWED HIS HEAD AND THROUGH THE ROSY TWILIGHT DIM WALKED UP AND SOFTLY SPAKE TO HIM
THE ROOM OVER THE RIVER GOOD-NIGHT MY LOVE GOOD-NIGHT
ALL BUT INSCRUTABLE YOUR GAZE DECLARES YOUR PLACE IS EVEN HERE SHARING THIS MARTYR'S CUP OF PRAISE AND YEAR BY SADLY WESTERING YEAR TILL THE LAST ALTAR LIGHTS GROW DIM DIVIDING SOVEREIGNTY WITH HIM
THY COURTLY JOY AND THY GENTLE WOE THY GRACIOUS GLADNESS AND PLAINTIVE FEARS ARE LOST IN THE CLAMOROUS AGE WE KNOW AND PALE LIKE A MOON IN THE LURID DAY
BEHIND THOSE WALLS IN THOSE DARK STREETS LIKE THE SOUND OF A RIVER SWIFT UNSEEN FLOWING IN DARKNESS
IT IS EVENING OVER THE GREAT TOWNS IT IS EVENING IN OUR HEARTS
THE SUN DESCENDING SOWS THE SEA WITH GOLD AND SHOWERS SPLENDOUR THROUGH THE FADING SKIES WHILST FROM THE MURKY WATERS THEY BEHOLD THE MOON A SHAPE OF SILVER SLOW ARISE
A SILVER WEB HAS THE MOON SPUN A SILVER WEB OVER ALL THE SKY
OVER THE TRACK-LINED CITY STREET THE YOUNG MEN THE GRINNING MEN PASS
WAS IT THINE LOST BIRD OR THE VOICE OF AN OLD DESPAIR CHANTING FROM YEARS LONG DEAD INEXORABLE SPIRIT FLYING ON TEMPEST WINGS THAT PASSED AND FLED THROUGH THE STORM CRYING
A FAREWELL NAY
WE TOO HAVE PRAYED IN MANY PLACES WHERE BEAUTY HAS COME AS I HAVE CLASPED YOUR HAND AND THROUGH LONG SILENCE LEARNED TO UNDERSTAND THE DUMB SWEET LANGUAGE OF YOUR EYES AND HAIR
I KNOW THEE YET I KNOW THEE NOT THEN HE WITH SHINING EYES HALF SHUT RADIANTLY STANDING THERE
A MILE AWAY THE TRIM NEW ENGLAND TOWN ECHOED THE BACCHANALIAN DIN THEY MADE
A PHANTOM OF MUSIC STRANGELY FLED FROM THE PRINCELY HALLS OF THE QUIET DEAD DOWN THE LONG LANES OF THE VANISHED YEARS ECHOING FRAILLY AND FAR AWAY
AND ONE LEAPT HIGH WITH SONG AND FRENZIED SHOUT AND ONE RAN SILENT WITH A GLEAMING FACE
ACROSS IT MANY LONELY FIGURES THEIR EYES A-FLARE WITH THE SUNSET THEIR FACES GLOWING WITH ITS COLORS TRAMP PAST ME THROUGH THE EVENING

DUDLEY POORE A RENAISSANCE PICTURE CALM LITTLE FIGURE IVY-CROWNED HOW LONG BENEATH THE BARREN TREE WHERE THIS PALE MARTYRED GOD HAS FOUND SURCEASE FROM HIS LONG AGONY YOU WATCH WITH AN UNTROUBLED GAZE LIFE MOVE ON ITS ACCUSTOMED WAYS
YOU WERE VERY SLIM IN YOUR BLUE SERGE DRESS
O DEAD OF YORE AND YESTERDAY ALL HAIL THE RESURRECTING MAY
MOANING SOFT AND PIPING SHARP ARE ITS WONDROUS MELODIES
AND NOW IN FLOODS OF TWILIGHT IN LONG GREEN WAVES OF SUNSET SOFTLY FLOWING EVENING
AND THOUGH THE LAST FRAIL TENDRILS AND FLOWERS OF INCENSE HAVE LONG AGO UNCURLED THEMSELVES AROUND THE CYNICAL CATHEDRAL I HEAR THE THIN WHITE VOICES OF CHILDREN LITTLE GIRLS AND LITTLE BOYS CALLING THE NAME OF JESUS AND HIS MOST SACRED HEART SINGING ABOUT A KIND OF PARISH HEAVEN A LITTLE WALLED CITY ALL GOLDEN AND LILAC LIKE THE ONE SEEN BY FRANCOIS VILLON'S MOTHER IN AN OLD BITUMINOUS SMOKE-BITTEN PAINTING OF THE MIDDLE AGES
WHILE DIM MISTS EARTH'S OUTLINES BLUR AND DRIP ALL NIGHT FROM LICHEN-GREENED ROOF-TILES
WHO GAV'ST AS ONE OF THOSE IMMORTAL MEN HIS LIFE THAT HIS FAIR CITY MIGHT NOT DIE
I WHO SO WELL THE FLESH HAD KNOWN I DID NOT KNOW THE SOUL
LIKE A GOLDEN GONG IN A TEMPLE WHICH A PRIEST ERE LONG WILL STRIKE INTO THROBBING SONG TO WAKE SOME SILENT TWINKLING CITY TO PRAYER
NO OTHER SOUL WAS IN THE PLACE AS UP THE HILL I CAME APACE
NO NEARER NOW THAN THE FIRST TIME THESE HANDS DARED LINGER IN CARESS UPON THE CURLS OF HIM WHOSE DARK EYES LAUGHED THEIR LOVE TO MINE
FACES ARE WAN IN THE ARC-LIGHT'S LIVID GLARE
THE STREET ITSELF AS IN SOME CRAZY DREAM STREAKS PAST A HALF-PERCEIVED MATERIAL STREAM
LIKE THE PALE MOTHS THAT HAUNT LUGUBRIOUS SHADOWS OF DIM TREES THEY CELEBRATE THEIR LUNAR MYSTERIES AT WOODLAND SHRINES WHERE WITH GREEN THYRSUS RODS AND WEAK LIMBS WRAPPED IN SILKEN SENSUOUS CLOTHS THEY CHANT THE NAMES OF THEIR DEAD PAGAN GODS

MEMORY BETWEEN ROUNDED HILLS WHITE WITH PATCHES OF BUCKWHEAT WHOSE FRAGRANCE FILLS THE LITTLE BREEZE THAT MAKES THE BIRCH-LEAVES QUIVER BESIDE A ROLLICKING SWIFT RIVER LIGHT GREEN IN THE DEEPS LIKE YOUR EYES IN SUNSHINE WINDS THE CANAL LAZY AND BROWN AS A WATER-SNAKE FULL OF DAZZLE AND SHEEN WHERE THE BREEZE SWEEPS THE WATER WITH GOSSAMER GARMENTS THAT SHAKE THE REEDS STANDING SENTINEL AND THE MARGINAL LINE OF BIRCHES AND WILLOWS
WERT THOU NOT CREATED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF EARTH AND IS NOT BEAUTY WISDOM WISDOM POWER
IF SWEET SORROW PASSES AND WHISPER LOW IN INTIMATE DELIGHT MY LOVE-SONG TO THE UNDULATING GRASSES
AT THIS END LIMP BUSHES OVERHANG PALELY REFLECTED IN THE AMBER-COLORED WATER
HE TOO PERCHANCE WAS THEN ALIVE NOW SEPARATE GHOSTS WE WANDER HERE
GRAVE DEEP-TONED TRUMPETS AND THE LYRE'S LONG WAIL AND FARTHER THE FAINT SOUND OF SINGING MEN
YET I CAN GIVE THAT HOPE NO NAME NOR THAT DIVINE EMOTION SHARE FOR THOUGH I SEE IT FLOWERING THERE BECAUSE OUR SPEECH IS NOT THE SAME THE PASSIONATE SECRET MUST LIE HID BURDENED WITH UNEXPRESSED DELIGHT WHERE NONE OF ALL MAN'S RACE CAN BID IT FORTH OR VOICE ITS BEAUTY RIGHT
YET I SHALL STILL FIND BEAUTY EVEN IN DEATH AND SOME LONE TRAVELLER OF THE NIGHT WILL HEAR AN ECHO OF MUSIC IN THAT QUIET PLACE
THE FIDDLER ONCE MORE I THOUGHT I HEARD HIM PLAIN THAT UNSEEN FIDDLER IN THE LANE UNDER THE TIMID TWILIGHT MOON PLAYING HIS VISIONARY STRAIN
HE TOO SAD HEART HATH TURNED TO REST AND SLEEP IS BEST
WHOSE WAS THE SCREAM THAT I HEARD IN THE MIDST OF THE HURRYING AIR
HERE WHERE THE HEADLAND LOOKS WIDE O'ER THE WATER I HAVE BROUGHT LAUREL LEAVES DECKING YOUR BARROW

IN VAIN WHERE THESE DEAD LEAVES LIE STROWN WHERE ALL THINGS BENDING EARTHWARD FAIL LIKE A YOUNG SPIRIT NEWLY FLOWN FLOWER-FRAGILE BLOSSOM-LIKE AND PALE YOU SEARCH
SHE LIES WITH SHUT EYES ROCKED IN THE ETERNAL FLOW OF SILENCE EVERMORE
YOU WERE STANDING A SLIM BLUE FIGURE AMID THE WHARF'S CROWD

THE LOVE YOU GAVE ME ALONE HAS SAVED AND YET WILL SAVE ME
SEA-BURIAL OVER THE SANDS THE SWOLLEN TIDE CAME CREEPING OVER THE SANDS BENEATH THE GLEAMING MOON
ARISE IN BLOOM UPON THE JOYOUS DAWN OF DOOM
IN SOME WELL-KEPT UNTROUBLED HELL WHERE FRUSTRATE SOULS LIKE MINE MAY DWELL I SHALL LOOK UP AND HEAR HIS NOTE COMING ACROSS THE ASPHODEL
THE SLEEPING WATERS BATHE HER SIDES THE WARM BLUE STREAMS OF THE ADRIAN SEA
THE BLACK RAM'S FLEECE IS STAINED WITH BLOOD THAT STEAMS DULL RED ON THE FROZEN GROUND

FOREVER THROUGH THE GROVES AND GLADES KIND THOUGHTS WENT SOFTLY TO AND FRO AND MEMORIES LIKE WHITE-FOOTED MAIDS WITH GENTLE TREAD WOULD COME AND GO AMONG THE EVER-GARRULOUS TREES

A ROW OF FLAT WHITE HOUSES AND A WHARF GLIDED IN SIGHT
AND NO CLOUDS EVER FLOAT BETWEEN THE GRAVE-FLOWERS AND MY HEART ON HIGH
THEY SAW US THROUGH THE MIST OF DAWN AND TURNING CALLED US TO THEIR FEAST THE SOUND OF LUTES AND CYMBALS CEASED BUT ONE HE FIXED HIS GAZE UPON
O IT IS LONELY LOVE LONELY IN LESBOS
THE HOARSE WHISTLE SHRIEKED FOR A LANDING
I MERELY NOTE NEW BLOSSOMS BLOWN AND BREATHE THE PERFUME OF THE AIR
OH THE HOARSE HALF-HEARD MURMUR SWIRLING BENEATH THE SNOWY BEAUTY OF MOONLIGHT
POPPY FIELDS AND RISING MOON

THE PASSAGE WAS BLACK
AUTUMN TWILIGHT'S DUSKY CURTAIN DROWSY POPPIES DRENCHED WITH RAIN
ABOUT ITS SUMMIT SOARING SEAGULLS FLY OR REST THEM IN ITS LOFTY CYPRESS TREES AND GREET THE BLACK BARGE BEARING THOSE WHO DIE UPON OUR EARTH TO EVERLASTING EASE AND PLEASANT LIVES THAT KNOW NOT MAN'S ETERNITIES
MITCHELL POPPY SONG I FOOTSTEPS SOFT AS FALL THE ROSE'S PETALS ON A DEWY LAWN SHAKEN WHEN THE WIND UNCLOSES GOLDEN GATEWAYS FOR THE DAWN
IN HER FLOODING GLORY ONE BY ONE LIKE GNATS IN A WEB THE STARS DIE
YET HAVE I GLIMPSED BY LONELY TREE BRIGHT BATHS OF IMMORTALITY
THE LIGHT OF LOVE IS THINE
PERCHANCE WE HAVE NO PERFECT CITY BEYOND THE WRACK OF THESE OUR WARS TILL DEATH ALONE IN SACRED PITY WASH WITH LONG SLEEP OUR WOUNDS AND SCARS
BY THIS DESOLATE SEA OUR TROUBLED WAYS SHALL SEPARATE FOREVER
THE ISLAND OF DEATH THERE IS AN ISLAND IN A SILENT SEA THAT RISES--FOUR ROUGH RUGGED WALLS--ON HIGH ABOVE THE OCEAN IN CALM MAJESTY
FACES TO THE WINDOWS CAME TEARS TO HAPPY EYELIDS STARTED FEELING AS BY SUDDEN FLAME THEIR CARES AND THEIR SAD HEARTS DISPARTED EACH OLD CLINGING SORROW DEAD
IF THIS SHOULD BE I SAY IF THIS SHOULD BE YOU OF MY HEART SEND ME A LITTLE WORD
WITH CYMBALS AND RATTLE OF CASTANETS AND SHRIEK OF SLUG-HORNS THE NORTH WIND BOWS THE OAK AND THE MOANING FIR ON RUSSET HILLS AND BY ROADSIDES STIFF WITH RIME
THE NIGHT WIND BRINGS AS TWENTY SUMMERS SINCE THE SILVER-BREASTED SWALLOWS FROM THE NILE TO QUIET SPARTA NESTLED IN HER HILLS LOCKED INLAND FROM THE VOICES OF THE SEA
HE WHO ADORES TOO MUCH THE IMPENDING HOUR THE BUDDING FLOWER WHO KNOWS NOT WITH WHAT DYES AN HOUR THAT'S DEAD IS GARMENTED WHO WALKS WITH GLIMMERING SHAPES COMPANIONLESS HE CANNOT GUESS WITH HOW GREAT LOVE AND THANKFULNESS I PRAISE THE YESTERDAYS

AND YET I DREAMED ALONE
OH UNHAPPY NOW TO FIND ME LOST NEATH HEAVENS HOT WITH NOON
I STOOD BESIDE YOU IN THE BOW WATCHED THE SUNLIGHT LOSE ITSELF AMONG YOUR HAIR THAT THE BREEZE TUGGED AT

THY BODY IS A BURNING GEM THY LIMBS ARE CHRYSOLITE
A TIME I LAY AND MARKED WITH CURIOUS STARE THE KEEN SUN-LANCES QUIVER ON THE LAWN AND THOUGHT ON SHRINES ALL VOICELESS NOW AND BARE THE HOLY GENIUS OF THEIR BOUGHS WITHDRAWN TILL WITH HOARSE CRY THE TRAIN THAT YOU WERE ON STABBED THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE EMPTY AIR
THE MOON HAS TANGLED THE DULL NIGHT IN HER SILVER SKEIN AND SET ALIGHT EACH DEW-DAMP BRANCH WITH MILKY FLAME
AND THAT OTHER NIGHT WHEN THE RIVER RIPPLED WITH FAINT SPEARS OF STREET LIGHTS VAGUELY REFLECTED
CONTENDING RHYTHMS CLASH
THRENODY SHE IS LAIN WITH HIGH THINGS AND WITH LOW
IN STIFF ARRAY THE WATER-REEDS WAVE AND SOLEMNLY SWAY TO THE WASH AND SWELL OF OUR PASSING
I AM TIRED OF SITTING QUIET AMONG THE BUSHES OF THE SHORE WHILE THE DARK BRIDGE STRETCHES ONWARD AND THE LONG POOLS GLEAM WITH LIGHT
AND WILL HE ANSWER
IN NATURE DEAD THE LIFE GODS STIR FROM RHADAMANTHUS AND THE ISLES WHERE SATURN RULES THE AGE OF GOLD COME OLD OLD GHOSTS OF BYGONE GODS
WHY SCATTER POLLEN ON THE AIR MARRY ITS PALE BUDS EACH TO EACH THE YEAR'S UNKINDLY TEMPESTS BEAR OR TO THE CALM CLEAR SUNLIGHT REACH
AND THAT'S HOW ALL THE STARS ARE MADE
CAN THIS AUTUMN TEMPEST TOUCH ANSWERING CHORDS IN YOU NO MORE
INCARNATION INCESSANTLY THE LONG RAIN FALLS SLANTING ON BLACK WALLS WHICH GLISTEN GOLD WHERE A STREET LAMP SHINES
TIME'S ANCIENT ALTARS WHENCE STRANGE INCENSE CURLED INNOCENT TO THE UNKNOWN GODS
THE CROWD THINS THE PLAYERS ARE ALONE
LOVE ME LOVE ME IF YOU WILL DO THIS I CAN BUY A FRINGED SILK SCARF OF YELLOW A HIGH COMB CARVED OF TORTOISE THEN WE WILL DANCE IN THE PLAZA SHE WAS ALONE THAT NIGHT
NORRIS OF TOO MUCH SONG SEDGES HAVE YOU SUNG TOO MUCH SEDGES GRAY ALONG THE SHORE
THE RECOMPENSE WHEN THE LAST SONG IS SUNG AND THE LAST SPARK OF LIGHT DIES OUT FOREVER AND THE DARK THE VOICELESS DARK ETERNAL SHROUDS THE EARTH
YE SAILS THAT SEEM TO WANDER IN DREAM-FILLED MEADOWS SAY IS THE SHORE WHERE I STAND THE ONLY FIELD OF STRUGGLE OR ARE YE HIT AND BATTERED OUT THERE BY WAVES AND WIND-GUSTS AS YE TACK OVER A CLASHING SEA OF WATERY ECHOES
FAIR CHILD OF LOVELINESS THESE ENDLESS FEARS ARE NOUGHT TO US
AND EVERY EVENING AS THE DAYLIGHT DIES THERE COMES THAT BARK OF DEATH WHOSE WHITE SAIL SEEMS AN ANGEL IN THE DARK
WHAT SACRED FINGERS MINGLED THEM AND TREMBLED WITH A GOD'S DELIGHT
SOMETIME WITH SHADOWY SAILS SHALL FLY ACROSS THE SHORELESS OCEAN OF INFINITY A SHIP FROM OUT THE PAST AND THE GREAT SEA OF LIFE SHALL BEAR YOU FROM THE STRANGE WORLDS OVER THE WAVES AND BACK AGAIN TO THE OLD LOVER
MERELY DREAMS FLUTTERING IN MY EYES
WITHIN THE DARK
BETWEEN THE CLIFFS BY THE FAINT STARS WE FOUND A GLOOMY GATE AND BOLDLY SAILING IN WATCHED THE DARK MOUNTAINS SLOWLY CLOSING ROUND AND HEARD FAINT ECHOES OF THE OCEAN'S DIN MELTING LIKE SPIRITS VOICES FLEET AND THIN
ESTLIN CUMMINGS AND S
IT SEEMED TO HAVE THE VOICE OF ALL DEAD MEN AND ALL FAIR WOMEN WHO HAD EVER DIED
DRAWBRIDGE AND PORTCULLIS SCREECHING BUGLES BRAYING SOON AND LATE
AND WILL HE WAKE AND HEAR
IT WAS MY IMMEMORIAL YEAR WHEN RHYMES CAME FAST AND BLOOD BEAT CLEAR
NO BLIGHTING WIND UPON THEIR BEAUTY BLOWS THE ALTAR GLOWS WITH FLAMES UNQUENCHABLE AND BRIGHT BY DAY BY NIGHT
THEY NEVER SEE THE DAWN
CYMBALS AT THE HANDS OF A TIRED GIRL SLIM WISP AMID THE SWIRL OF CROWDED STREETS TAKE UP THE TUNE MONOTONOUSLY IMPORTUNE
TALL WINDSOR SHOWS NO BLOSSOM LIKE THIS WIGHT BY PARK OR SEDGY POOL OR BEARDED MOAT
I THINK SOMETIMES I HAVE ALREADY PASSED INTO THE KINGDOM OF UNTROUBLED DEATH AND WANDERING LONELY AMONGST THEM I KNEW IN HELLAS OR THAT LAND BEYOND THE SEAS BEHOLD EACH SHADOW AS IT PASSES BY SHRINK HALF INVOLUNTARILY AND TURN AND VEIL ITS FACE AND VANISH IN THE GLOOM
SATURNALIA IN EARTH'S WOMB THE OLD GODS STIR FIERCE CHTHONIAN DIETIES OF OLD TIME
YOU ARE THE TREE THAT SUDDENLY AWOKE
LOVE AH-H
MINE ALSO LITTLE PAINTED POEM OF GOD
GO THEN
MY FAULTLESS TEACHERS BID ME FARE THE CYPRESS PATH OF BLOOD AND TEARS TREADING THE THORNY WOLD TO WHERE THE PAINFUL CROSS OF CHRIST APPEARS
TWAS ON ANOTHER SUNNIER HILL I MET YOU FIRST MY MIRACLE
THE NEW PLATONIST CIRCA 1640 OUR LOVES AS FLOWERS FALL TO DUST
FOSTER DAMON AND J
BESIDE YOU IN THE FLOWERING GRASS THE FEET OF YOUTH AND LOVE SHALL PASS AND WE THAT GREET YOU WITH A SMILE SHALL JOIN YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE
AND MUST FLY BACK A BLOWN ROSE LEAF ON THE COLD GALE
IS THE SUMMER ALL FORGOT NOW THE ICE IS DARK AND STRONG THAT HAS BOUND YOU TO THE SPOT DID YOU DIE OF TOO MUCH SONG
AND LOWLIER STILL HE BENT HIS HEAD

DOS PASSOS ROBERT HILLYER R
FROM WHAT DIM MOUNTAIN HAVE YOU STRAYED WHERE RINGED BY THE HELLENIC SEAS YOU DWELT IN AN UNTRODDEN GLADE SACRED TO WOODLAND DEITIES ALONG WHOSE FAINT PATHS WENT AT DAWN ENDYMION OR A DANCING FAUN
THROUGH THE BLACK NIGHT-RAIN HE SANG TO HER WINDOW BARS
WHEREVER MY DREAMS GO WHEREVER MY DREAMS GO YOU ARE ALWAYS THERE AND YOU AND I HAVE GONE TO MANY A LAND SEEING HIGH HILLS AT DAWN AND DESERT SAND TEMPLES AND MOSQUES AND PEOPLE BOWED IN PRAYER
I DO NOT READ UPON EACH STONE THE NAME THAT ONCE WAS CARVEN THERE
A CHORUS GIRL WHEN THOU HAST TAKEN THY LAST APPLAUSE AND WHEN THE FINAL CURTAIN STRIKES THE WORLD AWAY LEAVING TO SHADOWY SILENCE AND DISMAY THAT STAGE WHICH SHALL NOT KNOW THY SMILE AGAIN LINGERING A LITTLE WHILE I SEE THEE THEN PONDER THE TINSEL PART THEY LET THEE PLAY
THEN FLYING THE EMBRACING GLOOM OF BURNT-OUT DAYS AND PARCHED DESIRE I BUILT MY SOUL AN ALTAR FIRE OF LAUGHTER IN THE FACE OF DOOM
A GLORY HANGS ABOUT THY HEAD FOR THOU IN THINE IMMORTAL LOT IN HEAVEN'S OWN LIGHT ART GARMENTED
ROBERT HILLYER FOUR SONNETS FROM A SONNET-SEQUENCE I QUICKLY AND PLEASANTLY THE SEASONS BLOW OVER THE MEADOWS OF ETERNITY AS WAVE ON WAVE THE PULSINGS OF THE SEA MERGE AND ARE LOST EACH IN THE OTHER'S FLOW
HAPPY ARE YOU O CRIMSON ROSE BUT I HAVE STAINS UPON MY HANDS
WE GRASPED OUR OARS--BUT SLOWLY AS WILL PALE THE MORNING STAR THE VISION FADED THEN THE EMPTY DARK SWEPT IN AND ALL WAS NIGHT AGAIN
THERE IS SOME DEEPER SECRET LIES HIDDEN OUT OF HUMAN SIGHT IN KEEPING OF THOSE TRANQUIL EYES THAT SHINE WITH SUCH IMMORTAL LIGHT AND IN THEIR SHADOWS GLEAM AND GLOW WHILE STILL UPON YOUR PIPES YOU BLOW
AND THEN OF ALL THAT STARRY THRONG THAT STREAMED TOWARD THE UPPER SKY ONE SPIRIT DARTED DOWN AGAIN AND STOOD UPON A BOUGH NEAR BY
ALL THE CHAMBERS OF LOVE'S HOUSE WITH THAT SWEET MINSTRELSY WERE RINGING
ESTLIN CUMMINGS THOU IN WHOSE SWORD-GREAT STORY SHINE THE DEEDS THOU IN WHOSE SWORD-GREAT STORY SHINE THE DEEDS OF HISTORY HER HEROES SOUNDS THE TREAD OF THOSE VAST ARMIES OF THE MARCHING DEAD WITH STANDARDS AND THE NEIGHING OF GREAT STEEDS MOVING TO WAR ACROSS THE SMILING MEADS
A MOUNTAIN OF DESPAIR AGAINST THE SKY
NEITH SOMEHOW THE SPIRIT OF THAT DAY RAIN-CLOUDED STREETS AND BROODING AIR DETERMINED ME TO LIVE AND DARE LIVING TO LAUGH THE WORLD AWAY
TODAY NO NEARER THAN THE MORNING WHEN THERE STOOD IN LEDA'S PALACE ASKING FOR MY HAND TALL MENELAUS WITH HIS YELLOW HAIR
I AM TIRED OF THE SHRILLING OF INSECTS AND THE CROAKING OF FROGS IN THE RUSHES FOR THE WILD RICE IN THE MARSH-POOLS WAVES ITS BECKONING STREAMERS IN THE WIND AND THE RED SKY-GLORY FADES
LAUGHTER LIGHT AS IS THE SWALLOWS CHATTER IN THE EVENING SKY WAFTED UPWARD FROM THE HOLLOWS WHERE THE LIMPID WATERS LIE
STARE AT EACH SHIP THAT BRAVES THIS WILDERNESS OF WATERS AND GLIDES BY IN AWE-STRUCK SILENCE EVER FEARING TO DRAW NIGH
SONG O CRIMSON ROSE O CRIMSON ROSE CRUSHED LIGHTLY IN TWO LITTLE HANDS
A PLEASANT TRIP TO YOU I SAID
AND YET A FEW THERE MAY BE WHO WILL FEEL MY DEEP DEVOTION AND MY TRUE DESIRES AND KNOW THAT THESE UNHAPPY WORDS REVEAL ONLY NEW IMAGES IN CHANGELESS FIRES
EVEN AS AN ORACLE WHOSE SOUL A GOD HAS BREATHED UPON THE BEAUTEOUSNESS UNBEARABLE POSSESSED ME SO ALL STRENGTH WAS GONE
WE HAVE BEEN LOVERS IN ALL FAIR ROMANCES BEYOND THE RISING OR THE SUNKEN SUN
DECORATION A LITTLE PAGAN CHILD-GOD PLAYS BEYOND THE FAR HORIZON HAZE AND UNDERNEATH THE TWILIGHT TREES HE BLOWS A BUBBLE TO THE BREEZE WHICH IS BORNE UPWARD IN THE NIGHT AND MAKES THE HEAVENS SHINE WITH LIGHT
AND NOW THE MOON IS SAFE AWAY FAR OFF HER CARRIAGE LAMPIONS FLARE LOST IN THE SUNKEN ROADS OF DAY THEY VANISH IN THE ICY AIR
OF ALL THINGS IGNORANT YET WISE SITTING ENTHRONED AT LIFE'S LAST GOAL DIVIDING BODY FROM THE SOUL LOOKING AT EACH WITH FLAMELESS EYES
FAITH'S BANNER IS UNFURLED EVEN WHERE THE FARTHEST WATCHMEN THROUGH THE NIGHT CALL ON THE CLOUD-WRAPPED RAMPARTS OF THE WORLD
LAZARUS AT MORN WE PASSED A HALL WHERE SONG AND DANCE HAD BEEN AND WINE FLOWED FREE AND WHERE MID WRECKS OF REVELRY HAD LAIN THE FEASTERS ALL NIGHT LONG
TO WAR THE MUSIC BEATS UP THE CHASMED STREET THEN FLARES FROM AROUND THE CURVE
EACH LITTLE WAVE HAS CAUGHT A GOLDEN RAY AS IF THE DAWN HAD NEVER COME BEFORE
ABOVE IN THE LONG BLUE STRIP OF SKY THE WHIRLING PIGEONS THE THOUGHTLESS PIGEONS PASS
MORE PARAMOUNT THAN DEATH OR PAIN THIS GHOST WILL FOLLOW WHERE I GO
WHEN MOON AND STARS GO OUT FOR AYE AND I AM DEAD AND CASTAWAY THIS AUTUMN CITY I HAVE LOVED WILL KNOW ME NOT BUT HE WILL STAY
TWAS FROM COAST WE WATCHED SLOW FORM OUT OF THE FROSTY OCEAN'S BREATH THE BLUE-GRAY RAMPARTS OF THE STORM FLASHING WITH SIGNAL FIRES OF DEATH WHILST WITH A MURMUR FAR AND WIDE SWEPT IN THE LOW WIND WITH THE TIDE
MUCH LONGER FEED ON YEARNING AND DESPAIR AND ALL THE ANGUISH OF DEPARTED TIME
I ONLY HEARD A FAR FAINT SOUND OF SUMMER WATERS AND A CLEAR CALLING OF MUSIC FROM SOME LONELY STAR
AND THEN THAT HEAVENLY COMPANY WILL BEAR THE SHINING PLANETS IN AND GARNER THEM IN A DEEP BIN AND SORT THEM OUT AND SAVE THE SEED TO PLANT NEW TREES IN TIME OF NEED

BRIGHT AS THE SHATTERED SUN-RAYS WHERE THE PROW CUT THE STILL WATER THE WARM LIGHT CAUGHT AND TANGLED THERE RED GOLD AMID YOUR HAIR
DOS PASSOS THE BRIDGE THE LONELY BRIDGE CUTS DARK ACROSS THE MARSH WHOSE LONG POOLS GLOW WITH THE LIGHT OF A FLARING SUMMER SUNSET
THEY RISE UP FROM THE BLEEDING EARTH IN GRACIOUS LEGIONS OF RE-BIRTH EACH AS A FLOWER OR A TREE OF VERDANT IMMORTALITY
A FAR-OFF BELL SOBS WITH A SWEET VIBRATION LONG AND SLOW A LAST FAREWELL FOREVERMORE FAREWELL
YOU COULD NOT GUESS WHAT JOY YOU BROUGHT INTO MY LONELINESS
MEN MUTTER RUNES IN LANGUAGE DEAD BY NIGHT WITH RUMBLING DRUM IN QUAKING GROVES WHERE THE WOODLAND SPIRITS ARE HAILED
SMILED SHE NOT WHEN AT THE EDGE OF EVENING WE WALKED ALONE PLUCKING SPRING'S BLOSSOMS FROM THE HEDGE THAT SHE MIGHT WEAR THEM AS HER OWN OR DO I HOLD A HOPELESS TRYST HERE WITH A SHADOW MADE OF MIST
SUCH STRONG DESIRES THE UNIVERSAL GIVER WITH UNKNOWN PLAN HAS BURIED DEEP IN ME THAT THE EXQUISITE JOY OF WATCHING THEE HAS DOMINATED ALL MY LIFE'S ENDEAVOR
WHERE THEN SHALL FLOWER THE BEAUTY OF YOUR FACE O LOVE THE LAUGHING YOUTH THE ROSE-IN-HAND IN WHAT UNKNOWN AND UNDISCOVERED LAND SHALL FLOWER THEN THE BEAUTY OF YOUR FACE
IMMUTABLE UNKNOWN UNSUNG THROUGH TRIUMPH AND DELIGHT UNEARNED THROUGH SORROW UNDESERVED I LEARNED SALVATION FROM THY WORDLESS TONGUE
LO LOOK ON HER THE WONDER OF THE WORLD BEAUTEOUS HELEN LACEDAEMON'S QUEEN I WATCH THEM GAZE INTENTLY ON MY FACE AS THEY WOULD KEEP IT IN THEIR MEMORY FOREVER AND THE VERY WHILE THEY GAZE I SEE THE FLAME OF TROY GLEAM IN THEIR EYES
DEAR PHANTOM THIS IMMORTAL GUISE THIS DISEMBODIED SELF OF THINE HATH DAZED MINE UNACQUAINTED EYES
WHAT HAST THOU DONE WITH THEIR ALMIGHTY GIFT AND THEN ERE I WOULD ANSWER SILENCE FALLS AROUND ME AND THE DARK DIVIDES AND I SEE THE BLUE TWILIGHT ON THE SPARTAN HILLS
THOU WEARIEST OF HAVING ME SO NEAR I FEEL THE SCORN THOU HAST WITHIN THY HEART AND YET THY FACE HAS NEVER SEEMED SO DEAR AS NOW WHEN I AM MINDED TO DEPART
FROM THE GRAVE OF YOUTH THERE GROWS A PASSIONATELY-PETALED ROSE WHERE THE VIRGIN WHITELY LIES A LILY FAIR AS PARADISE
LET US BE GODS OF STONE AND SET OUR IMAGES BEYOND THE YEARS ON SOME HIGH MOUNT WHERE WE CAN BE ALONE
SOME OTHER BOY'S BRIEF MORN AWAY TILL SAPPHIRE WINDOWS PALELY BURN AMID THE UNDEFEATED GRAY
IT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE SO
CRY TO THE WORLD THAT I DESPAIR NO MORE HEART GREETS MY HEART AND HOPE HAS PROVED ITS WORTH
THERE WERE NONE NEAR US WHEN THE DARK HAD GONE ONLY THE CLEAN WIND OF A SAILLESS SEA AND YOU AND I ALONE IN THE GREAT DAWN
AND WHEN THE SEEDS ARE ROUND AND FULL THE WATCHFUL GODS WILL COME AND PULL THE RIPENED FRUIT FROM OFF THE TREE
BELLS JANGLED
AND PALE VOTARIES SHIVER WITH THE COLD THAT NUMBS THE EARTH AND ETCHES PATTERNED MIRRORS ON THE PONDS
GRIEF IS NO MORE LOVE RISES WITH THE SPRING O FLY FREE WIND AND RAPTURE
LOVE DREAM STRANGE THAT ON WARP AND WOOF OF DREAMS FANCY SHOULD WEAVE THE WEB OF TRUTH AND YET THIS FAIRY FIGMENT SEEMS PART OF A HALF-FORGOTTEN YOUTH STOLEN FROM DAYS I THOUGHT WERE SPED OUT OF THE WORLD BEYOND THE DEAD
AND WHILE NIGHT RUSTLES THROUGH THE TREES DRAGGING THE STARS ALONG I KNOW THE MOON IS RISING ON THE BREEZE QUIVERING AS IN A RIVER'S FLOW
CEASE THOU FOR I WAS BUT SLEEPING DREAMING ONLY AND NOT DEAD
IN DRIVEN CLOUDS THE OLD GODS COME WHEN FOGS THE FACE OF APOLLO HAVE VEILED
ACROSS THE TAUT STRINGS ACROSS THE TAUT STRINGS OF MY YEARNING SOUL PASS FINGERS OF ALL FLEET AND BEAUTIFUL THINGS
CAN THE HEART LOVE STILL WHEN TIS DEAD
WHEN THE FIERCE FOEMAN OF OUR RACE MARSHALS HIS LORDS OF LUST AND PRIDE YOU SPRING WITHIN A MOMENT'S SPACE FULL-ARMED AND SMILING TO MY SIDE
YEA NOW ANOTHER SCARLET DAY IS DONE HE CRIED IN ANGUISH AND WITH SUDDEN GRACE STRETCHED FORTH HIS ARMS AS THOUGH HE WOULD ERASE THE FEW DIM EMBERS OF THE SCATTERED SUN
PALE NEATH THE RISING MOON LIES MYTILENE
AND THOU SHALT EVER BE AS NOW THOU ART AND I SHALL WATCH THEE WITH UNTROUBLED HEART
TODAY THEY MARCH AWAY
YOU MIGHT HAVE RESTED BUT FOR THIS
I KNOW NOT BUT I KNOW THAT ALL RETURNS AT LAST UNCHANGED AND TO THE HEART THAT YEARNS SHALL BE REPAID ALL LONELINESS AND LOSS
TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE

BUT NOW THE SUN HAS RISEN AND THE SPRAY LEAPS INTO SUDDEN LIGHT ALONG THE SHORE

IT IS ONLY HE THAT IS THE ONE UNCONQUERABLE FOE HE IS THE SUDDEN TEMPEST NONE CAN KNOW WINGED WITH SWIFT WINDS THE NONE MAY HOPE TO FLEE
LET US BE TRUE TO YOUTH AND LOVE AND ALL DELIGHT CLEAN AND REFRESHED AND ONE WITH YOU I WOULD BE EVER AS TO-NIGHT AND HEED NOT WHAT THE DAY WILL BRING NOR ANYTHING

ALTHOUGH I NEVER GUESSED I COULD FORGET THOSE FEW GREAT MOMENTS WHEN WE BOTH WENT MAD THE OTHER DAY AT SOMEONE'S TEA WE MET SMILING GAYLY BOWED AND WENT OUR SEVERAL WAYS COMPLACENT WITH SUCCESSFUL COLDNESS.--YET SUDDENLY I WAS BACK IN THE OLD DAYS BEFORE YOU FELT WE OUGHT TO DRIFT APART

WE CANNOT TELL
BEYOND THE CLIFFS BROWN FISHING BOATS GO BY UNDER THE REACH OF THE WIDE LAUGHING SKY
LOW A GREY MOON SHROUDED IN SEA FOG
TOMORROW IS AS YESTERDAY
AND FAR ACROSS THE PORTICOS I HEAR THE IVORY SHUTTLE SINGING IN THE LOOM MIDST MAIDENS CHATTER AS IN OLDEN DAYS
SOMETHING IN ME IS A HARP PLAYED BY EVERY WANTON BREEZE
AND ONCE I THOUGHT IN A FAR SOLITUDE THE BLACK WAVES MOANED AND BROKE UNUTTERABLY ON A STERN CLIFF WHERE HAND IN HAND WE STOOD
THESE SHADOWY SOULS ARE ALL UNKNOWN TO GRAVES AND LIVE FAINT PHANTOMS IN A FAIRY LAND OF DREAMS AND IDLENESS
OH THE TRIUMPHING SENSE OF LIFE A-THROB
SO IN SOME PICTURE ON WHICH AS ON A LYRE AN OLD ITALIAN PAINTER LABORIOUSLY HAS PLAYED HIS SOUL AWAY HIS LOVE ALL HIS DESIRE FOR FRAGRANT THINGS AFAR FROM EARTH SHINES THE MADONNA AS WITH A VEIL OVERLAID BY INCENSE-SMOKE AND DUST AGE-OLD AT WHOSE FEET IN TIME OF DEARTH OR NEED A MYRIAD MEN HAVE LAID THEIR SORROWS AND ARISEN BOLD
AT FIRST IT SEEMED A CHILD'S UNCERTAIN CROON AND THEN A SOUND OF MANY MOURNERS WEEPING
ART THOU NOT HELEN DOWERED OF THE GODS WITH ALL THAT MAN CAN COVET
SEE WHERE THE SWALLOWS FLY SOUTH O'ER THE OCEAN
WHO ARE THEY THAT COME BESEECHING CALLING AT MY CASTLE GATE
ANTINOUS IS DEAD WE KNEEL BEFORE THE PORTALS OF OUR PAST IN VAIN NOR RAISE THE LAUGHING PHANTOMS OF OUR YESTERDAYS UPON THIS DESOLATE AND EMPTY SHORE
NOW DEEPENING POOLS OF SHADOW OVERFLOW INTO THE SEA OF DARK
A CHILD'S SOFT KISS WAS IN YOUR HEART A CHILD'S WARM BREATH WAS IN YOUR SOUL
THE SCARLET DAY IS DONE AND SOON THE LIGHT WILL WAKE AGAIN MY DESECRATED SKIES
IV LONG AFTER BOTH OF US ARE SCATTERED DUST AND SOME STRANGE SOULS PERCHANCE SHALL READ OF THEE FINDING THE YEARNINGS THAT HAVE CRUSHED FROM ME THESE POOR CONFESSIONS OF MY LOVE AND TRUST I KNOW HOW MISINTERPRETED WILL BE THESE LINES FOR MEN WILL LAUGH OR MORE UNJUST THINKING NOT ONCE OF LOVE BUT ONLY LUST WILL STAIN THE VESTURE OF OUR MEMORY
THREE DROWSY POPPIES BROODED BY THE WALL LONELY AND TALL
WE TALKED OF MEANINGLESS THINGS EDUCATION AGREED THAT UNLESS SOMETHING WERE CHANGED DISASTER WOULD COME TO THE NATION
ART THOU NOT HE THAT LATE WAS DEAD THE DRINKER RAISED HIS CUP ON HIGH AND MURMURED
OUR LITTLE STEAMER PULLS ITS WAY WITH JINGLE OF BELLS AND PANTING THROB OF OLD ENGINES
WE SPREAD THE SAILS AND SWIFTLY THE SHIP PLOWED THE PURPLE PATH AHEAD UNTIL THE SURF SANG LOUD
HOW OFTEN IN THE DEWY BRAKE I'VE HEARD ABOVE THE SIGHING WEIRS THE NIGHT-BIRD SINGING FOR YOUR SAKE HIS LONELY SONG OF LOVE AND TEARS
THEN AT LAST WHEN LIPS WERE DUMB WITH FEAR OF PARTING DID WE WEND ALONG THE MEADOW LANES THAT COME FROM NOWHERE AND IN NOTHING END AND SMILING KISS THOUGH ILL AT EASE UNDER THE RUSTLING ORCHARD TREES
SOMETIMES HIS GHOSTLY RONDELAY BROKE ON MY DREAM AT DAWN OF DAY AND THROUGH MY OPEN WINDOW STOLE THE PERFUMED MARVEL OF THE MAY
AHEAD THE CANAL SHIMMERED BLOTCHED GREEN BY THE WATER-WEEDS
WESTWARD THE EVENING STAR SINKS IN THE MOUNTAINS
THOU BY WHOSE PAGE WE BREAK THE PRECIOUS BREAD OF DEAR COMMUNION WITH THE PAST AND WED TO VALOR BATTLE WITH HEROIC BREEDS
AND YET IT COULD NOT ROUSE HER FROM HER SLEEPING
INCESSANTLY THE LONG RAIN FALLS SLANTING ON BLACK WALLS
AFTER RAIN ALL DAY THE HEAVY SKIES HAVE LOWERED LONG BEATEN BY AUTUMNAL RAIN
AS WE WALKED OUR FOOTSTEPS CLATTERED LOUD
THERE WE FLOATED WRAPPED IN WILD PERFUME
II OH UNHAPPY NOW TO WAKEN WHEN THE DREAM HAD SCARCE BEGUN
III PHANTOMS FLITTING AND UNCERTAIN SWEEPING ROUND THE ENDLESS PLAIN
DWELL IN A DREAMLAND OR ELSE BE LOST IN LIFE'S ETERNITY

THEN ALL AT ONCE A CRESTED WAVE WAS SWEEPING AROUND THE STILL FORM IN THE MOONLIGHT THERE TWINING ITS SILVER FINGERS IN HER HAIR
AMONG THE REEDS THE RIPPLES SOB AND DIE AWAY TILL THE CANAL IS STILL AGAIN SAVE FOR A KINGFISHER'S FLASHING ACROSS THE NOON SHIMMER
GOOD-NIGHT MY LOVE GOOD-NIGHT GOOD-NIGHT
COMINGS OF DAWN AND MOONLIGHT GLIMMERINGS MID-SUMMER HUSH AND SABBATH BELLS THAT TOLL OVER BROAD FIELDS A SOUND OF THRUSHES WINGS NEAR SUNSET HOUR A GIRL WITH LIPS APART WONDER AND LAUGHTER,--THESE HAVE TOUCHED MY HEART AND LEFT THEIR MUSIC LINGERING ON ITS STRINGS
NOW AS WILL CRUMPLED ROSE LEAVES PENT BY FINGERS WE CAN NEVER KNOW ROUSE WITH THE RICHNESS OF THEIR SCENT THOUGHTS OF A SUMMER LONG AGO ALL THE EXPANSE OF LAND AND SEA SPEAKS WITH A THOUSAND TONGUES TO ME
THAT LOVE'S INTENSE FLAME BURNING THROUGH THE SHUDDERING BODY WITH A KISS WOKE IN THE PRISONED SPIRIT TOO SO KEEN AN ECSTASY OF BLISS AS COULD FOR ALL THEY MADE AMISS NOR LIFE NOR DEATH UNDO
DOST THOU DEAR FRIEND NOT KNOW ME YET YES FOR I KNOW THY VOICE I SAID
IN A SHOP-WINDOW SPANGLED IN LONG LINES BY RAIN-DROPS ALL A-GLOW AN ITALIAN WOMAN'S FACE FLAMES INTO MY SOUL AS I GO HASTILY BY IN THE TURBULENT DARKNESS AN OVAL OLIVE FACE WITH THE SWEETLY SULLEN GRACE OF THE VIRGIN WHEN FIRST SHE SEES AMID HER GARDEN'S SILVER LILIES THE WHITE-ROBED ANGEL GLEAM AND SOFTLY AS BY A SULTRY DREAM FEELS ALL HER SOUL SUBDUED UNTO THE FIRE AND RADIANCE OF HER ECSTASY
LOVELY AS DEATH IN THE MOON'S SHROUD WERE TOWN STREETS GREY HOUSES DIM FULL OF STRANGE PEACE IN THE SILENT NIGHT
IS THE PLAYING OVER-FAST THOUGH THE ANSWER NOW IS STRONG
EVEN I UNSEALED THY SIGHT HE SAID
DOMESDAY THE GARLANDS AND THE SONGS OF MAY SHALL WELCOME IN THE JUDGMENT DAY
YES IN SOME FUTURE FAR BEYOND SURMISE YOU WILL DREAM HERE WITH HALF-REMEMBERING EYES AND I SHALL WRITE THESE WORDS CONTENT AWHILE IN THE SLOW ROUND OF TIME TO SEE YOU SMILE
SUDDENLY FROM THE STARLIT PLAINS OF AIR ETHEREAL TUMULT AIRY TEMPEST BLEW IMMORTAL MUSIC SHOWERING EVERYWHERE FLASHED TO THE EARTH IN AN HARMONIOUS DEW LEAPED JUBILANT FROM CLOUD TO CRAGGY CLOUD BINDING THE MOON IN A MELODIOUS CHAIN STORMING THE TROUBLED STARS A LUMINOUS CROWD DROPPING IN FIERY STREAKS TO EARTH AGAIN
THE SUNLIGHT SLEPT UPON THE STILL UPLANDS YOUR FIGURE FADING IN THE DUSTY RED I WATCHED AWHILE THEN TURNED WITH CASUAL FACE TO WHERE A TORRENT GLIMMERED DOWN A GLADE NO HUMAN VOICE TROUBLED THE LOVELY PLACE ONLY THE FALL A CRUEL MUSIC MADE
AND HUGE THE MOON BROODS ON THE NIGHT
AND WITH THE DAWN THEIR KEEPERS CAME FOR THEM
NO SHADES WILL GATHER AT HIS TUNE TO DANCE THEIR GHOSTLY RIGADOON ONLY THAT LONELY VOICE WILL CLEAVE THE EVERLASTING AFTERNOON
THERE WE MIGHT WANDER YOU AND I ALONE THROUGH GARDENS FILLED WITH MARBLE SEATS MOSS-GROWN AND FOUNTAINS--WATER-THREADS THAT WINDS DISPERSE WHILE IN THE SPRAY THE BIRDS SIT AND CONVERSE
AND MEN STILL MURMUR AS THEY PASS ME BY
I LATCHED THE GATE AT DAWN OF DAY I PLANTED POPPIES BY THE DOOR TO HIS RETREATS I CAME AWAY AND I SHALL WANDER THENCE NO MORE
YOU ARE THE STAR THAT MADE THE SKIES ALL BRIGHT YET TORE ITSELF AWAY IN FLAMING FLIGHT
WHITE HALLS AND PALACES THEIR DWELLINGS STAND
SECURE FROM ENVIOUS TIME'S DEFLOWERING BREATH THEY KNOW NO DEATH BUT SILENTLY IMPERISHABLY FAIR GROW LOVELIER THERE
AND IN THAT OLD OAK'S LEAFY GLEE SOME GOUTY SIRE MAKES SPORT OF ME
ALL THAT FAIRY LAND BEHIND ME
THEN MUSIC BURST UPON US IN A GALE
OH THAT ANOTHER DAWN MIGHT NEVER RISE MY FOOLISH CHILDREN THROUGH THE VAST OF NIGHT THE YOUNG STARS SHIVERED IN A SILVER HORDE BEFORE THE INFINITE SORROW OF THEIR LORD
MY SOUL IS CAUGHT IN THE WEB OF THE MOON LIKE A SHRILLING GNAT IN A SPIDER'S WEB
THE LITTLE STEAMER CREAKED AGAINST THE SIDE LOUD SCREAMED THE WHISTLE AGAIN
BUT HE RISKED IT DEATH IN THE DARKNESS OR HER HOT ARMS--(_LOVE--LOVE ME AH-H-H A GOOD OLD TUNE SHE MURMURED AND I FOUND WE WERE DANCING
A SEA GULL GREY WINGS O GREY WINGS AGAINST A CLOUD OVER THE ROUGH WAVES FLASHING WHOSE WAS THE SCREAM STARTLING AND LOUD KEEN THROUGH THE SKIES,--WAS IT THINE OVER THE MOANING WIND AND THE WHINE OF THE WIDE SEAS DASHING
WHEN OF A SUDDEN AS WE FALTERED NIGH OUT OF THE HILLS WHERE ONLY NIGHT HAD BEEN A MIST OF MINARETS AND TOWERS HIGH ROSE LIKE THE YELLOW LIGHT OF MORNING IN THE SKY
WITHIN YOUR CHILDISH HEART THERE DWELLS NO SORROW THAT UPRISING DIMS YOUR EYE WHENCE NOT A TEARDROP WELLS FOR PITY OF THOSE WRITHEN LIMBS OR FOR THE TRAVAIL OF A RACE CONSUMMATE IN ONE LIFELESS FACE
IMPORTUNATE MEMORIES SHRILL IN MY EARS LIKE THE GNATS THAT DIE IN THE SPIDER WEB
ABOUT THE BASKING COUNTRY-SIDE BLOSSOM THE SOULS OF THEM THAT DIED
ODOURS AND SOUNDS COME IN TO US FAINT WITH THE PASSION OF THIS NIGHT ONE LITTLE DREAM HANGS LUMINOUS ABOVE YOU IN THE SCENTED LIGHT
AND THEN WITH FOAM THE SKIES ARE SPLASHED AND SPRAYED
DOWN THE WORN OUT YEARS A SOB OF BROKEN LOVES
THE CHEERS BREAK OUT FROM THE WAVING CROWD
MORE TIGHTLY UNDER HIS CLOAK HE CLASPED HIS GUITAR
INSTEAD LET US RELENT AND HAIL THE PAST WITH PRAISE
TIME IS NO LOVER
WITH A START THEN I REMEMBERED HOW I LIVED ALONE WRITING BAD POEMS AND EATING OUT MY HEART ALL FOR YOUR BEAUTY.--HOW THE TIME HAS FLOWN
YET FROM ONE BLACK DISC WE TASTED AGAIN THE BITE OF CRUDE SPANISH PASSION
THEY HEAR THE WAVES SING AND THE WINDS COME CALLING FROM THE CAVES OF NIGHT BEYOND THE OCEAN AND THE CRY OF SCREAMING GULLS
WHO ART THOU THAT KNEELEST WEEPING BY THE BORDER OF MY BED
THE LILAC'S WITHERED LEAVES LIE SHOWERED WHERE LITTLE RAIN-POOLS STAR THE PLAIN
WE FELT THE NIGHT AS A TROUBLED SONG
AMONG THEM A CONSTANT BANJO-TWANGING OF FROGS AND SHRILLING OF TOADS AND OF INSECTS RISES AND FALLS IN CHORUS RHYTHMIC AND STIRRING
DRIVE THEM HENCE FOR THEY ENCUMBER DAYS AND NIGHTS WITH WAKING PAIN
IF ON ANOTHER'S FACE YOUR SWEET HAIR LAY IN SUCH A SILENCE AS I KNOW OR SUCH GREAT WRITHING WORDS AS UTTERING OVERMUCH STAND HELPLESSLY BEFORE THE SPIRIT AT BAY
FROM GROVES WHERE SACRIFICING THRONGS CALLED YOU BY SOME FAIR GRECIAN NAME WITH RITUAL MEET AND CHORIC SONGS STRANGE THAT TO THIS DARK HILL YOU CAME TO SEEK UNMINDFUL OF THEIR LOSS A REFUGE UNDERNEATH THE CROSS
COLORS COME AND GO FRAIL AZURES FLUTTERING FROM NIGHT'S OUTER WING STRONG SILENT GREENS SERENELY LINGERING ABSOLUTE LIGHTS LIKE BATHS OF GOLDEN SNOW
I THOUGHT I HEARD THE LISP OF FALLING DEW IN A DARK MEADOW WHERE NO BREEZES STIRRED
DIM THROUGH SURGING DARKNESS SAYING WORDS OF PRAYER AND MURMURED PSALMS
NIGHT PIECE A SILVER WEB HAS THE MOON SPUN A SILVER WEB UPON ALL THE SKY WHERE THE FRAIL STARS QUIVER EVERY ONE LIKE TANGLED GNATS THAT HUM AND DIE
