THE MEN WHO HAD LIVED IN LOG-CABINS WHO HAD HUNTED THEIR WAY THROUGH UNTRODDEN WOODS AND PRAIRIES WHO HAD THOUGHT AS MUCH ABOUT THE CHANCES OF SWIMMING OVER SWOLLEN FORDS AS OF THEIR CASES WHO HAD PASSED THEIR NIGHTS--A HALF-DOZEN TOGETHER--ON THE FLOORS OF WAYSIDE HOSTELRIES COULD NEVER BE PRECISELY THE SAME SORT OF PRACTITIONERS AS THE SMUG BARRISTERS OF A MORE CONVENTIONAL AGE AND PLACE
DURING THE WHOLE OF THE PRECEDING YEAR A STEADY AND EARNEST PROPAGANDA OF ANNEXATION HAD BEEN ON FOOT STARTING FROM THE IMMEDIATE ENTOURAGE OF THE PRESIDENT AND EMBRACING A LARGE NUMBER OF SOUTHERN CONGRESSMEN
THEIR TWO COMPANIONS WERE SOON WAYLAID AND KILLED AND THE BOONES SPENT THEIR LONG WINTER IN THAT MIGHTY SOLITUDE UNDISTURBED
OF THE REMAINING VOTES LINCOLN RECEIVED 15 TRUMBULL 35 SCATTERING 1
MEANWHILE BOTH RETAINED THEIR DISTINCTIVE PARTY NAMES AND ORGANIZATIONS
THE STORM CAME ON WITH SUCH SUDDENNESS THAT ALL WHO WERE ABROAD HAD GREAT TROUBLE IN REACHING THEIR HOMES AND MANY PERISHED
HIS RAFT CAPSIZED IN THE OHIO RIVER BUT HE FISHED UP HIS KIT OF TOOLS AND MOST OF THE ARDENT SPIRITS AND ARRIVED SAFELY AT THE PLACE OF A SETTLER NAMED POSEY WITH WHOM HE LEFT HIS ODD INVOICE OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS FOR THE WILDERNESS WHILE HE STARTED ON FOOT TO LOOK FOR A HOME IN THE DENSE FOREST
ON THE WRONG SIDE HE WAS ALWAYS WEAK
IT WAS ARDUOUS MARCHING
HE CAN MAKE ANYTHING THE YANKEE STUDENT WAS SOUGHT INTRODUCED AND HAD THE MECHANICAL PROBLEM LAID BEFORE HIM
AND IT WAS NOT ONLY INCLINED BUT FORCED TO MAKE ITS BATTLE EITHER UNDER THE OLD NAME OF WHIGS OR AS BECAME MORE POPULAR UNDER THE NEW APPELLATION OF AMERICANS WHICH GREW INTO A MORE DIGNIFIED SYNONYM FOR KNOW-NOTHINGS
THIS WAS AN ANTI-SLAVERY CITY AND THE CURRENT OF POPULAR CONDEMNATION AND EXASPERATION WAS RUNNING STRONGLY AGAINST HIM
HENRY CLAY SIDENOTE
THE CONTROL OF LEGISLATION FOR THE TERRITORIES WAS FOR THE MOMENT COMPLETELY IN THE HANDS OF DOUGLAS
AND LINCOLN WHO NOW ACTED AS SECOND TO THE DOCTOR IN HIS TURN RECORDS THE CESSATION OF THE CORRESPONDENCE AMID THE AGONIZED EXPLANATIONS OF WHITESIDES AND THE SCORNFUL HOOTINGS OF MERRYMAN WHILE THE TOWN WAS IN A FERMENT AND A STREET FIGHT SOMEWHAT ANTICIPATED IN RESPECT TO THE LAST DIVERSION THE TOWN WAS DISAPPOINTED
ITS ROLL CONTAINED THE NAMES OF MANY EMINENT MEN FEW OF WHOM WERE LESS KNOWN THAN HIS WHICH WAS DESTINED TO A FAME MORE WIDE AND ENDURING THAN ALL THE REST TOGETHER
DEATH'S GHASTLY SHADE WAS SLOWLY CAST UPON EACH MANLY BROW BUT CALM AND FEARLESS TO THE LAST THEY SLEEP SECURELY NOW
BROWNING ONE OF HIS INTIMATE VANDALIA ACQUAINTANCES
BUT WHEN HE GOVERNS HIMSELF AND ALSO GOVERNS ANOTHER MAN THAT IS MORE THAN SELF-GOVERNMENT--THAT IS DESPOTISM
AND YOU GO TO WORK FOR THE BEST MONEY WAGES OR IN DISCHARGE OF ANY DEBT YOU OWE THAT YOU CAN GET
AND THE CURE BY FAITH WAS AS WELL KNOWN TO THEM AS IT HAS SINCE BECOME IN A MORE SOPHISTICATED STATE OF SOCIETY
THE TERRITORY OF MISSOURI CONTAINING THE OLD FRENCH COLONIES AT AND NEAR ST LOUIS HAD ATTAINED A POPULATION OF 60,000 AND WAS EAGER TO BE ADMITTED AS A STATE
THERE WERE FEW BOOKS OR NONE AND THERE WAS LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXCHANGE OF OPINION
MR EARLY WHO FOLLOWED HIM WAS SO ROUSED BY HIS ENERGETIC ATTACK THAT HE FELT HIS ONLY RESOURCE WAS A FLAT CONTRADICTION WHICH IN THOSE DAYS MEANT MISCHIEF
EVERYTHING THAT YEAR SEEMED TO WORK AGAINST THE WHIGS
RECITING THE PRESIDENT'S PROCLAMATION OF FEBRUARY SECRETARY WOODSON NOW ISSUED HIS OWN PROCLAMATION FORBIDDING ALL PERSONS CLAIMING LEGISLATIVE POWER AND AUTHORITY AS AFORESAID FROM ASSEMBLING ORGANIZING OR ACTING IN ANY LEGISLATIVE CAPACITY WHATEVER
PEACH 183/4
192-4 THIS WAS EXQUISITE IRONY
THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS HAD PROVOKED THE MEXICAN WAR AND PRESIDENT POLK IN ANTICIPATION OF FURTHER IMPORTANT ACQUISITION OF TERRITORY TO THE SOUTH AND WEST ASKED OF CONGRESS AN APPROPRIATION OF TWO MILLIONS TO BE USED IN NEGOTIATIONS TO THAT END
LINCOLN THE 2D PRESERVER OF HIS COUNTRY
IT MUST BE NOTED IN PASSING THAT BY THIS TIME THE TERRITORY HAD BY INSENSIBLE DEGREES DRIFTED INTO THE CONDITION OF CIVIL WAR
THESE ROADS LASTED FAR INTO THE SPRING WHEN THE SNOW HAD MELTED FROM THE PLAINS AND WOUND FOR MILES LIKE THREADS OF SILVER OVER THE RICH BLACK LOAM OF THE PRAIRIES
HE WAS ONE OF NATURE'S NOBLEMEN FROM MASSACHUSETTS WRITES THE GRATEFUL PROSECUTOR

NO DOUBT IT LED TO CONFERENCES DURING THE MEETING OF THE LEGISLATURE EARLY IN THE YEAR 1855 WHEN THE SENATORIAL QUESTION CAME ON FOR DECISION
WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON THE SPEECH CONCLUDES WITH THESE SWELLING WORDS
IT IS RELATED OF YOUNG ABRAHAM THAT HE SORROWED MOST OF ALL THAT HIS MOTHER SHOULD HAVE BEEN LAID AWAY WITH SUCH MAIMED RITES AND THAT HE CONTRIVED SEVERAL MONTHS LATER TO HAVE A WANDERING PREACHER NAMED DAVID ELKIN BROUGHT TO THE SETTLEMENT TO DELIVER A FUNERAL SERMON OVER HER GRAVE ALREADY WHITE WITH THE EARLY WINTER SNOWS
FOR BY THIS TIME THE SPARROWS HAD FOLLOWED THE LINCOLNS FROM KENTUCKY AND THE HALF-FACED CAMP WAS GIVEN UP TO THEM
THE FURNITURE OF THEIR HOUSES WAS MADE WITH AN AXE FROM THE TREES OF THE FOREST
AN ATTEMPT AT CROSSINGS WAS MADE BY LAYING DOWN LARGE CHUNKS OF WOOD
ON THE DAY OF ELECTION IN 1840 WORD CAME TO HIM THAT ONE RADFORD A DEMOCRATIC CONTRACTOR HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF ONE OF THE POLLING-PLACES WITH HIS WORKMEN AND WAS PREVENTING THE WHIGS FROM VOTING
UNDER THIS RULE NOTWITHSTANDING THE MOST STRENUOUS EFFORTS TO RESCIND IT NATHANIEL P
THE UTTERLY RECKLESS SILENCED ALL SCRUPLES IN PROFANITY AND DRUNKENNESS
HIS PANTALOONS DIDN'T MEET HIS SHOES BY SIX INCHES
BUT ENOUGH HAS BEEN QUOTED TO JUSTIFY THE TRADITION WHICH LINCOLN LEFT BEHIND HIM AT THE BAR OF ILLINOIS
27 1854
I HATE IT BECAUSE IT DEPRIVES OUR REPUBLICAN EXAMPLE OF ITS JUST INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD
HE PRECEDED IT AND PREPARED FOR IT BY THE INTRODUCTION ON THE 22D OF DECEMBER OF A SERIES OF RESOLUTIONS REFERRING TO THE PRESIDENT'S PERSISTENT ASSERTIONS THAT THE WAR HAD BEEN BEGUN BY MEXICO BY INVADING OUR TERRITORY AND SHEDDING THE BLOOD OF OUR CITIZENS ON OUR OWN SOIL AND CALLING UPON HIM TO GIVE THE HOUSE MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION UPON THESE POINTS
IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO BUY AS NOTHING WAS EVER GIVEN IN PAYMENT BUT A PROMISSORY NOTE
IF THE COURTS SHOULD DECIDE IN FAVOR OF THE SOUTH THE NORTHERN DEMOCRATS WOULD DEFEND THE SOUTHERN VIEW
THE CIRCUIT PREACHERS WERE FOR A LONG TIME THE ONLY CIRCULATING MEDIUM OF THOUGHT AND EMOTION THAT KEPT THE ISOLATED SETTLEMENTS FROM UTTER SPIRITUAL STAGNATION
MEMBERS THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE IMAGINED ON SEEING THE HOUSE DIVIDED THAT IT WAS THE SAME BODY WHICH HAD ASSEMBLED THERE A YEAR BEFORE
THEY WERE TO LEAD BRIGADES AND DIVISIONS IN TWO GREAT WARS
HE NEVER COULD REFRAIN FROM TALKING OF THEM HIMSELF HAVING NONE OF CORIOLANUS'S REPUGNANCE IN THAT RESPECT AND FOR THAT REASON WAS A CONSTANT TARGET FOR NEWSPAPER WITS
BAKER'S CARELESSNESS IN MONEY MATTERS WAS INTOLERABLE TO HIM AND HE WAS GLAD TO ESCAPE FROM AN ASSOCIATE SO GIFTED AND SO EXASPERATING
IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO GIVE THE DETAILS OF THE BLOODY DRAMA THAT NOW RAPIDLY RAN TO ITS CLOSE
THE RESOLUTIONS WERE NEVER ACTED UPON BY THE HOUSE THE VOTE ON THE ASHMUN PROPOSITION HAVING SUFFICIENTLY INDICATED THE VIEW WHICH THE MAJORITY HELD OF THE PRESIDENT'S PRECIPITATE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL PROCEEDING
CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT JEFFERSON HAD ORIGINATED THE POLICY OF SLAVERY RESTRICTION IN HIS DRAFT OF THE ORDINANCE OF 1784 THE NAME BECAME SINGULARLY APPROPRIATE AND WHEREVER THE FREE-SOILERS SUCCEEDED IN FORMING A COALITION IT WAS ADOPTED WITHOUT QUESTION
HIS HEART BLED
A COMPROMISE WAS AGREED UPON AND A FORMAL TREATY WRITTEN OUT AND SIGNED
WHENCE THEY WALKED FIVE MILES TO SPRINGFIELD WHERE OFFUTT HAD GIVEN THEM RENDEZVOUS
IF HE GAZED OUT OVER THE WAVING PRAIRIE IT WAS TO SEARCH FOR THE COLUMN OF SMOKE WHICH TOLD OF HIS ENEMIES APPROACH
ALL ADMINISTRATION THEREFORE EMANATED FROM THAT BODY REFLECTED ITS WILL AND FOLLOWED ITS BEHEST
3 ONE OF THE ACTORS IN THE POLITICAL DRAMA OF KANSAS WAS SAMUEL DEXTER LECOMPTE CHIEF-JUSTICE OF THE TERRITORY
THIS WAS THE READY-MADE COMMON GROUND OF COOPERATION
THENCE DUE NORTH TO THE 42D PARALLEL OF LATITUDE WHICH IT FOLLOWS TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN
MORE THAN A YEAR BEFORE THIRTEEN OF THE WHIG ANTISLAVERY CONGRESSMEN HEADED BY THE ILLUSTRIOUS JOHN QUINCY ADAMS HAD ISSUED A FERVID ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE FREE STATES DECLAIMING IN LANGUAGE OF PASSIONATE FORCE AGAINST THE SCHEME OF ANNEXATION AS FATAL TO THE COUNTRY CALLING IT IN FACT IDENTICAL WITH DISSOLUTION AND SAYING THAT IT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF OUR NATIONAL COMPACT ITS OBJECTS DESIGNS AND THE GREAT ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES WHICH ENTERED INTO ITS FORMATION OF A CHARACTER SO DEEP AND FUNDAMENTAL AND WOULD BE AN ATTEMPT TO ETERNIZE AN INSTITUTION AND A POWER OF NATURE SO UNJUST IN THEMSELVES SO INJURIOUS TO THE INTERESTS AND ABHORRENT TO THE FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE FREE STATES AS IN OUR OPINION NOT ONLY INEVITABLY TO RESULT IN A DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION BUT FULLY TO JUSTIFY IT
LINCOLN'S POPULARITY IN LAW AND POLITICS
HE NEVER THOUGHT OF MAKING A DIVINITY OF HER BUT LINCOLN COULD NEVER HAVE CLAIMED THIS HAPPY IMMUNITY FROM IDEAL TRIALS
THEY SELECTED THEIR HOMES IN THE MOST ELIGIBLE SPOTS TO WHICH CHANCE OR THE REPORT OF EARLIER EXPLORERS DIRECTED THEM WITH LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OR CARE AS TO THE RIGHTFUL OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND AND TOO OFTEN CLEARED THEIR CORNER OF THE WILDERNESS FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS
IN THE INVENTORY OF HIS EFFECTS MADE AFTER HIS DEATH HE IS STYLED BY THE APPRAISERS MORDECAI LINCOLN GENTLEMAN HIS SON JOHN RECEIVED BY HIS FATHER'S WILL A CERTAIN PIECE OF LAND LYING IN THE JERSEYS CONTAINING THREE HUNDRED ACRES THE OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS HAVING BEEN LIBERALLY PROVIDED FOR FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA PROPERTY
GENTLEMEN SAID MRS GREENE APPLY TO MY YOUNG FRIEND MR ELI WHITNEY
AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO FORCE AN EXPRESSION IN REGARD TO THE WILMOT PROVISO BUT IT WAS NEVER PERMITTED TO COME TO A VOTE
THE MAGNIFICENT SCHEMES OF THE FOREGOING WINTER REQUIRED SOME REPAIRING
ITS POPULATION WAS RAPIDLY INCREASING UNDER THE STIMULUS OF ITS PROBABLE CHANGE OF FLAG
BETWEEN FRIENDS SO INTIMATE THERE WERE NO CONCEALMENTS AND FROM THE MOMENT LINCOLN FOUND HIS SERVICES AS NURSE AND CONSOLER NEEDED THE VIOLENCE OF HIS OWN TROUBLE SEEMED TO DIMINISH
AND THE PROJECT OF UNITING LAKE MICHIGAN WITH THE ILLINOIS RIVER BY A CANAL WAS OF TOO EVIDENT UTILITY TO BE OVERLOOKED
NO SOONER DID THE SPRING WEATHER OF 1856 PERMIT THAN MEN MONEY ARMS AND SUPPLIES WERE POURED INTO THE TERRITORY OF KANSAS FROM THE NORTH
BROWNING AND J
MR LAMBORN REFERS TO THE LATE ELECTIONS IN THE STATES AND FROM THEIR RESULTS CONFIDENTLY PREDICTS EVERY STATE IN THE UNION WILL VOTE FOR MR VAN BUREN AT THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
BAKER AND OTHERS THERE WERE FEW INDEED WHO IN THOSE DAYS APPLIED THEMSELVES WITH ANY DEGREE OF PERSISTENCY TO THE CLOSE STUDY OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES
ALL THESE PROCEEDINGS TOO SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE CONSPIRACY
SHAWNEE MISSION WAS ONE OF OUR MANY NATIONAL EXPERIMENTS IN CIVILIZING INDIAN TRIBES
BUT HIS CLOTHES WERE FROZEN LIKE SHEET IRON AND MAN AND SADDLE HAD TO BE TAKEN INTO THE HOUSE TOGETHER TO BE THAWED APART
BUT HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS REASON FORBADE HIM TO BE SILENT
AND IT ENDED THE CAREER OF MANY AN ASPIRING POLITICIAN IN A BLAST OF DEMOCRATIC INDIGNATION AND SCORN
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE WORKED FOR HIS BOARD OFTENER THAN FOR ANY OTHER COMPENSATION AND HIS HEARTY FRIENDLINESS AND VIVACITY AS WELL AS HIS INDUSTRY IN THE FIELD MADE HIM A WELCOME GUEST IN ANY FARMHOUSE IN THE COUNTY
NO NEW ARRIVALS OF RETURNS ON EITHER SIDE
AND A FEW NEWSPAPERS AND SPEAKERS IN KANSAS HAD ADOPTED THE PREVAILING POLITICAL NAME

IN MAJOR STUART'S POSSESSION SIDENOTE
DOUGLAS SINCE HIS PUBLIC REBUFF AT CHICAGO ON SEPTEMBER 1 HAD BEGUN AFTER A FEW DAYS OF DELAY AND REST A TOUR OF SPEECH-MAKING SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE STATE
THE BUSINESS OF OFFUTT HAD GONE TO PIECES AND HIS CLERK WAS OUT OF EMPLOYMENT WHEN GOVERNOR REYNOLDS ISSUED HIS CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS TO MOVE THE TRIBE OF BLACK HAWK ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI
WHETHER IT BE TRUE OR NOT I CAN SAY FOR ONE THAT I HAVE NO OTHER SO GREAT AS THAT OF BEING TRULY ESTEEMED OF MY FELLOW-MEN BY RENDERING MYSELF WORTHY OF THEIR ESTEEM
HE WAS CONTINUALLY CALLED ON TO SERVE IN THE MOST INCONGRUOUS CAPACITIES
HEWING OUT THEIR PLANTATIONS IN THE PRIMEVAL WOODS AMID THE UNDISTURBED SHADOW OF CENTURIES BREAKING A SOIL THICK WITH AGES OF VEGETABLE DECOMPOSITION SLEEPING IN HALF FACED CAMPS WHERE THE HEAVY AIR OF THE RANK WOODS WAS IN THEIR LUNGS ALL NIGHT OR IN THE FOULER ATMOSPHERE OF OVERCROWDED CABINS THEY WERE ESPECIALLY SUBJECT TO MIASMATIC FEVERS
IT HAD OCCASIONED NUMEROUS THREATS TO DISSOLVE THE UNION AND IN ONE OR MORE INSTANCES CAUSED MEMBERS ACTUALLY TO RETIRE FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HE REFUSED TO COME
IT EXTENDED TO THE MOST MINUTE DETAILS OF LIFE
FROM BLOOMINGTON TO PEKIN
IT IS PROBABLE TOO THAT INFORMATION OF ITS FULL ENORMITY DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REACH HIM
THIS SIMPLE LIFE HE LOVED PREFERRING IT TO THE PRACTICE OF THE LAW IN A CITY WHERE ALTHOUGH THE REMUNERATION WOULD BE GREATER THE OPPORTUNITY WOULD BE LESS FOR MIXING WITH THE GREAT BODY OF THE PEOPLE WHO LOVED HIM AND WHOM HE LOVED
APPENDIX CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 1860-1 PP
IN FACT OUTSIDE OF HIS PROFESSION HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAY TO MAKE MONEY AND HE NEVER EVEN ATTEMPTED IT
167 THE PRINCIPAL OPPOSITION TO ANNEXATION IN THE NORTH HAD BEEN MADE EXPRESSLY UPON THE GROUND THAT IT WOULD INCREASE THE AREA OF SLAVERY AND THE COMPARATIVE INDIFFERENCES WITH WHICH MR CLAY TREATED THAT VIEW OF THE SUBJECT COST HIM HEAVILY IN THE CANVASS
HE WAS MORE OR LESS A POLITICIAN AS WERE ALL HIS COMPEERS AT THE BAR BUT HE WAS ALWAYS MORE A LAWYER THAN ANYTHING ELSE
A MORE STRINGENT FUGITIVE-SLAVE LAW WAS PASSED
THUS IT BECAME THE TEMPORARY COUNTY-SEAT DULY DESCRIBED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS AS A CERTAIN POINT IN THE PRAIRIE NEAR JOHN KELLY'S FIELD ON THE WATERS OF SPRING CREEK AT A STAKE MARKED Z AND D THE INITIALS OF THE COMMISSIONERS TO BE THE TEMPORARY SEAT OF JUSTICE FOR SAID COUNTY
HE WAS ELECTED IN AUGUST FOOTNOTE
DEMOCRATIC DEFEAT
THE GOVERNOR REFUSED TO INTERFERE TO PROTECT THE THREATENED TOWN THOUGH AN URGENT APPEAL TO DO SO WAS MADE TO HIM BY ITS CITIZENS WHO AFTER STORMY AND DIVIDED COUNCILS RESOLVED ON A POLICY OF NON-RESISTANCE
FOR ALTHOUGH BUT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE HE FELL BY THE BULLET OF THE ASSASSIN THE TRADITION IS ALREADY COMPLETE
18 WHAT MIGHT NOT BE EXPECTED OF LAWMAKERS WHO BEGIN WITH SO AMBITIOUS AN EXORDIUM AND WHO LAY THE CORNERSTONE OF THEIR EDIFICE UPON THE SOLID ROCK OF POLITICAL PRINCIPLE
LINCOLN WAS GREATLY AVERSE TO ALL THIS WOOLING AND PULLING AS HE CALLED IT
THE BOARD SEEMS TO HAVE CONSISTED MAINLY OF ITS CHAIRMAN AS LINCOLN MADE THE DEPOSIT OF MONEY REQUIRED BY LAW SURVEYED THE ROUTE PLOTTED THE ROAD AND WROTE THE REPORT
THERE IS NO GENERAL DESIRE AMONG AMERICANS FOR ACQUIRING OUTLYING TERRITORY HOWEVER INTRINSICALLY VALUABLE IT MAY BE
GLOBE TAVERN SPRINGFIELD WHERE LINCOLN LIVED AFTER HIS MARRIAGE

THE ESPECIAL WORK INTRUSTED TO HIM WAS THE SUBDIVISION OF THE COUNTY AND THE PROJECT FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE TO SPRINGFIELD
LINCOLN GAVE INTO OUR KEEPING ALL THE OFFICIAL AND PRIVATE PAPERS AND MANUSCRIPTS IN HIS POSSESSION TO WHICH WE HAVE ADDED ALL THE MATERIAL WE COULD ACQUIRE BY INDUSTRY OR BY PURCHASE
WE HAVE THEREFORE THE REVISED TEXT OF HIS ARGUMENT AND ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS CHARACTER AND VALUE
THOMAS LINCOLN SETTLED DOWN IN THIS DISMAL SOLITUDE TO A DEEPER POVERTY THAN ANY OF HIS NAME HAD EVER KNOWN
UNDER THESE COMBINED INFLUENCES ONE OR TWO ERRATIC BUT RATHER PROMINENT WHIGS IN CENTRAL ILLINOIS DECLARED THEIR ADHERENCE TO NEBRASKAISM AND RAISED THE HOPE THAT THE DEMOCRATS WOULD REGAIN IN THE CENTER AND SOUTH ALL THEY MIGHT LOSE IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE STATE
HE WAS DOUBLY FORTUNATE IN THIS MOVE AS THE NOMINATION HE WAS UNABLE TO TAKE AWAY FROM LOGAN PROVED USELESS TO THE LATTER WHO WAS DEFEATED AFTER A HOT CONTEST
HE WAS STILL THE CENTER OF INTEREST OF EVERY SOCIAL GROUP HE ENCOUNTERED WHETHER ON THE STREET OR IN THE PARLOR
THESE ARE ALL INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT VOLUMES
DAVID SEARS SAYS THE MOST BRILLIANT OF MR LINCOLN'S SPEECHES IN THIS CAMPAIGN WAS DELIVERED AT WORCESTER SEPTEMBER 13 1848 WHEN AFTER TAKING FOR HIS TEXT MR WEBSTER'S REMARK THAT THE NOMINATION OF MARTIN VAN BUREN FOR THE PRESIDENCY BY A PROFESSED ANTISLAVERY PARTY COULD FITLY BE REGARDED ONLY AS A TRICK OR A JOKE MR LINCOLN PROCEEDED TO DECLARE THAT OF THE THREE PARTIES THEN ASKING THE CONFIDENCE OF THE COUNTRY THE NEW ONE HAD LESS OF PRINCIPLE THAN ANY OTHER ADDING AMID SHOUTS OF LAUGHTER THAT THE RECENTLY CONSTRUCTED ELASTIC FREE-SOIL PLATFORM REMINDED HIM OF NOTHING SO MUCH AS THE PAIR OF TROUSERS OFFERED FOR SALE BY A YANKEE PEDDLER WHICH WERE LARGE ENOUGH FOR ANY MAN AND SMALL ENOUGH FOR ANY BOY IT IS EVIDENT THAT HE CONSIDERED VAN BUREN IN MASSACHUSETTS AT LEAST A CANDIDATE MORE TO BE FEARED THAN CASS THE REGULAR DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE CHAPTER XVI A FORTUNATE ESCAPE WHEN CONGRESS CAME TOGETHER AGAIN IN DECEMBER THERE WAS SUCH A CHANGE IN THE TEMPER OF ITS
EVEN THAT PERIOD OF GLOOM AND DEPRESSION OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN AND WHICH HAS BEEN SO MUCH EXAGGERATED BY THE CHRONICLERS AND THE GOSSIP OF SPRINGFIELD COULD NOT HAVE INTERRUPTED FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME HIS ACTIVITY AS A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE
63 SIDENOTE
YOU SEEM A SPRIGHTLY ENERGETIC MAN
IT IS INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT HE DID MORE
LANE AND OTHERS REFUSED THE TEST OATH AND WERE EXCLUDED FROM PRACTICE AS ATTORNEYS IN THE COURTS
AND THAT SLAVERY SHOULD BE PROHIBITED IN SUCH STATES AS MIGHT BE FORMED OUT OF THE PORTION LYING NORTH OF THAT LINE
STUART THOUGH EVEN THEN GIVING PROMISE OF THE DISTINCTION AT WHICH HE ARRIVED IN HIS PROFESSION LATER IN LIFE WAS AT THAT PERIOD SO ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO POLITICS THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE OFFICE WAS ALTOGETHER A SECONDARY MATTER TO HIM
BUT THE PARTY TICKET WILL SUCCEED TRIUMPHANTLY
THE SECRETS OF THE TERRITORIAL COMMITTEE LEAKED OUT AND CONSULTATIONS MULTIPLIED
IT IS THE PECULIAR MISFORTUNE OF BOTH YOU AND ME TO DREAM DREAMS OF ELYSIUM FAR EXCEEDING ALL THAT ANYTHING EARTHLY CAN REALIZE BUT BEFORE LONG A LETTER CAME FROM SPEED WHO HAD SETTLED WITH HIS BLACK-EYED KENTUCKY WIFE UPON A WELL-STOCKED PLANTATION DISCLAIMING ANY FURTHER FELLOWSHIP OF MISERY AND ANNOUNCING THE BEGINNINGS OF THAT LIFE OF UNEVENTFUL HAPPINESS WHICH HE LED EVER AFTER
THIS HOUSE IS STILL STANDING OPPOSITE ST PAUL'S CHURCH CALLED THE GLOBE WHICH WAS VERY WELL KEPT BY A WIDOW LADY OF THE NAME OF BECK AND THERE THEIR FIRST CHILD WAS BORN WHO WAS ONE DAY TO BE SECRETARY OF WAR AND MINISTER TO ENGLAND AND FOR WHOM WAS RESERVED THE STRANGE EXPERIENCE OF STANDING BY THE DEATH-BED OF TWO ASSASSINATED PRESIDENTS

THIS COMPROMISE WAS NOT AT FIRST HEARTILY ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE

HIS FORMER PARTNER HAD BEEN EDWARD D
HE WAS REASONABLY SURE OF HIS OWN COUNTY AND HE TRIED TO INDUCE LINCOLN TO CONSENT TO AN ARRANGEMENT THAT ALL CANDIDATES SHOULD CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THEIR OWN COUNTIES IN THE CANVASS
THE PROUD DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY OF THE PIERCE ELECTION WAS ANNIHILATED
I FIND SPEAKING HERE AND ELSEWHERE ABOUT THE SAME THING
THE SOUTHERN POLITICIANS SAW CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT WITH THE ADMISSION OF FLORIDA THE SLAVE TERRITORY WAS EXHAUSTED WHILE AN IMMENSE UNTOUCHED PORTION OF THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE STILL STRETCHED AWAY TO THE NORTH-WEST TOWARDS THE PACIFIC ABOVE THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE LINE WHICH CONSECRATED IT TO FREEDOM
CLAY PUBLISHED A LETTER IN WHICH HE ADVOCATED THE FUSION OF ANTI-NEBRASKA VOTERS UPON BENTON SEWARD HALE OR ANY OTHER GOOD CITIZEN AND AFTERWARDS MADE A SERIES OF SPEECHES IN ILLINOIS

THE WHIGS WERE TO CONTROL THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR FOUR YEARS TO COME

BUT THE INTENDED DISTINCTION WAS TRANSITORY
AMID THE MULTIPLICITY OF HIS ENGAGEMENTS HE HAD FAILED TO PROCURE A FLAT-BOAT AND THE FIRST WORK HIS NEW HANDS MUST DO WAS TO BUILD ONE

THE FOLLOWING IS MY GUESS AS TO WHAT WILL BE DONE
HE WAS OF ABOUT THE SAME AGE BUT HAD RESIDED LONGER IN THE DISTRICT HAD A LARGER PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE AND WAS A MUCH READIER AND MORE PLEASING SPEAKER
HE KEPT UP AN EXTENSIVE CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE CAPTAINS OF TENS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT
IN MOST RESPECTS THERE HAD BEEN LITTLE MORAL OR MATERIAL IMPROVEMENT SINCE THE EARLY SETTLEMENT OF THE COUNTRY
THE FACT THAT THEY NOW BECAME MORE PRUDENT CONCILIATORY AND PRACTICAL IN THEIR SPEECHES AND PLATFORMS DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REMOVE EXISTING PREJUDICES AGAINST THEM
THE VERDICT OF CLARY'S GROVE WAS UNANIMOUS THAT HE WAS THE CLEVEREST FELLOW THAT HAD EVER BROKE INTO THE SETTLEMENT HE DID NOT HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY SCUFFLING TO GUARD HIS SELF-RESPECT AND AT THE SAME TIME HE GAINED THE GOOD-WILL OF THE BETTER SORT BY HIS EVIDENT PEACEABLENESS AND INTEGRITY

THEY PERMITTED AN INDEPENDENT DEMOCRAT KNOWN UNDER THE SOBRIQUET OF STEAMBOAT SMITH TO PARADE HIS OWN NAME
MANY A TRAVELER APPROACHING A RUDE HUT IN THE WOODS IN THE GATHERING TWILIGHT DISTRUSTING THE GAUNT AND SILENT FAMILY WHO GAVE HIM AN UNSMILING WELCOME THE BARE INTERIOR THE RIFLES AND KNIVES CONSPICUOUSLY DISPLAYED HAS FELT HIS FEARS VANISH WHEN HE SAT DOWN TO SUPPER AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE IN A FEW FERVENT WORDS INVOKED THE BLESSING OF HEAVEN ON THE MEAL
A DROVE OF A THOUSAND HOGS WHICH WERE BEING DRIVEN TO ST LOUIS RUSHED TOGETHER FOR WARMTH AND BECAME PILED IN A GREAT HEAP
THE RIVER BEING VERY LOW WAS WITHOUT CURRENT SO THAT WE HAD TO PULL HARD TO MAKE HALF THE SPEED OF LEGS ON LAND
DURING THE FORENOON THE DEPUTY-MARSHAL RODE LEISURELY INTO THE TOWN ATTENDED BY LESS THAN A DOZEN MEN BEING NEITHER MOLESTED NOR OPPOSED
THE FLIGHT OF EX-GOVERNOR REEDER
ITS PHRASEOLOGY WAS ADROIT ENOUGH TO CALL FORTH A SNEERING COMPLIMENT FROM SPEAKER STRINGFELLOW WHO WROTE TO THE SQUATTER SOVEREIGN
BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THESE FIRST YEARS OF HIS LIFE HAD THEIR LASTING EFFECT UPON THE TEMPERAMENT OF THIS GREAT MIRTHFUL AND MELANCHOLY MAN
NOWHERE HAD THAT DESPOTIC LEADER MORE VIOLENT AND UNSCRUPULOUS PARTISANS THAN THERE
WE HAVE FELT THE OBLIGATION OF USING IT WITH PERFECT FAIRNESS
AS ONLY TWO DOLLARS WAS PAID FOR KILLING A WOLF IT IS EASY TO SEE HOW THE PIONEERS REGARDED THE FOREST FOLK IN POINT OF RELATIVE NOXIOUSNESS
A LITTLE WAY FROM HIS CABIN AN OPEN GLADE WAS FULL OF DEER-LICKS AND AN HOUR OR TWO OF IDLE WAITING WAS GENERALLY REWARDED BY A SHOT AT A FINE DEER WHICH WOULD FURNISH MEAT FOR A WEEK AND MATERIAL FOR BREECHES AND SHOES
THE MISSOURI CABAL ON THE OTHER HAND HAVING THREE OF THEIR BEST MEN CONSTANTLY AT THE GOVERNOR'S SIDE WERE COMPELLED TO RECOGNIZE THEIR LACK OF JUSTIFICATION
IT WAS EASY WORK
A STRANGE TASK ONE WOULD SAY TO UNDERTAKE IN BEHALF OF A YOUNG AND ARDENT LOVER
WHEN HE WENT HOWEVER HE DISTINCTLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE DID NOT PURPOSE TO TAKE UP HIS TIME WITH THIS PERSONAL AND CONGRESSIONAL CONTROVERSY
DAVID E
WE SHALL HAVE SO SAVED IT THAT THE SUCCEEDING MILLIONS OF FREE HAPPY PEOPLE THE WORLD OVER SHALL RISE UP AND CALL US BLESSED TO THE LATEST GENERATIONS
DECEMBER 1 1855
BUT HIS VORACITY FOR ANYTHING PRINTED WAS INSATIABLE
WHEN FIRST ELECTED HE HAD NEVER WORN ANYTHING EXCEPT LEATHER
HIS BEARING IN THIS ATTITUDE WAS MARKED BY HIS USUAL INDIVIDUALITY
STILL THERE WAS MUCH LESS OF FORM AND CEREMONY INSISTED UPON THAN IS CONSIDERED PROPER AND NECESSARY IN OLDER COMMUNITIES
ATCHISON'S PROPAGANDA
AND THAT HE HAD INTIMATED TO OUR CHARGE D'AFFAIRES THAT WE WERE PREPARED TO SETTLE THE BOUNDARY ON THE MOST LIBERAL TERMS
AND THE HISTORY OF EVERY COUNTRY SHOWS THAT THESE ARE NEVER LACKING WHEN THEY ARE WANTED
HIS SIMPLE AND INFLEXIBLE VERACITY COMMUNICATES HIS TROUBLE AND HIS MISERY TO THE WOMAN WHOM HE LOVES
BUT NOW FROM THAT BEGINNING WE HAVE RUN DOWN TO THE OTHER DECLARATION THAT FOR SOME MEN TO ENSLAVE OTHERS IS A SACRED RIGHT OF SELF-GOVERNMENT THESE PRINCIPLES CANNOT STAND TOGETHER
AMONG THEM WERE HAMLIN OF BRINCKERHOFF OF OHIO AND MCCLEL-MAINE
AN AFTERNOON OF ROUGH GAMES AND OUTRAGEOUS PRACTICAL JOKES
IT HAS MADE CAUSED MANY TOWNS AND CITIES TO RISE AND FLOURISH IN THE SOUTH
HIS FIRST SPEECHES ON THE NEW AND ALL-ABSORBING TOPIC WERE MADE IN THE NEIGHBORING TOWNS AND IN THE COUNTIES ADJOINING HIS OWN
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE 2 RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END THE STORM OF AGITATION WHICH THIS MEASURE AROUSED DWARFED ALL FORMER ONES IN DEPTH AND INTENSITY
WILLIAM H
HORACE GREELEY WHO SHOULD BE REGARDED AS AN IMPARTIAL WITNESS IN SUCH A CASE SAYS THE LIBERTY PARTY SO-CALLED PUSHED THIS VIEW OF THE MATTER BEYOND ALL JUSTICE AND REASON INSISTING THAT MR CLAY'S ANTAGONISM TO ANNEXATION NOT BEING FOUNDED IN ANTISLAVERY CONVICTION WAS OF NO ACCOUNT WHATEVER AND THAT HIS ELECTION SHOULD ON THAT GROUND BE OPPOSED IT AVAILED NOTHING THAT MR CLAY ALARMED AT THE DEFECTION IN THE NORTH WROTE A THIRD AND FINAL LETTER REITERATING HIS UNALTERED OBJECTIONS TO ANY SUCH ANNEXATION AS WAS AT THAT TIME POSSIBLE
HITHERTO STRINGENT FEDERAL LAWS HAD KEPT SETTLERS AND UNLICENSED TRADERS OUT OF THE INDIAN TERRITORY WHICH LAY BEYOND THE WESTERN BOUNDARIES OF ARKANSAS MISSOURI AND IOWA AND WHICH THE POLICY OF OUR EARLY PRESIDENTS FIXED UPON AS THE FINAL ASYLUM OF THE RED MEN RETREATING BEFORE THE ADVANCE OF WHITE SETTLEMENTS
WHILE NOT OPPOSING AN INCREASE OF TERRITORY UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES HE SAID IN A LETTER WRITTEN FROM RALEIGH N.C TWO WEEKS BEFORE HIS NOMINATION,--"I CONSIDER THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS AT THIS TIME WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF MEXICO AS A MEASURE COMPROMISING THE NATIONAL CHARACTER INVOLVING US CERTAINLY IN WAR WITH MEXICO PROBABLY WITH OTHER FOREIGN POWERS DANGEROUS TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE UNION INEXPEDIENT IN THE PRESENT FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT CALLED FOR BY ANY EXPRESSION OF PUBLIC OPINION HE SUPPORTED THESE VIEWS WITH TEMPERATE AND JUDICIOUS REASONS WHICH WERE RECEIVED WITH MUCH GRATIFICATION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
BUT THE AFFAIR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE FREE-STATE MEN WERE INSURRECTIONISTS AND OUTLAWS
AND WHEN HIS SLOW ANGER WAS ROUSED HE WAS A FORMIDABLE ADVERSARY
IT WAS UPON THIS FIELD OF RADICALLY DIVERSE SENTIMENT THAT IN THE YEAR 1854 DOUGLAS'S SUDDEN PROJECT OF REPEAL FELL LIKE A THUNDERBOLT OUT OF A CLEAR SKY
HE SAYS HE USED TO PLAY WITH ABE LINCOLN IN THE SHAVINGS OF HIS FATHER'S CARPENTER SHOP
JOHN C
IN AFTER YEARS WHEN THE EMIGRATION FROM THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN STATES BEGAN TO POUR IN THE PRAIRIES WERE RAPIDLY TAKEN UP AND THE RELATIVE GROWTH AND IMPORTANCE OF THE TWO SECTIONS OF THE STATE WERE IMMEDIATELY REVERSED
MEANWHILE THE FIVE DAYS PRESCRIBED IN HIS PROCLAMATION FOR RECEIVING NOTICES OF CONTEST ELAPSED
IF YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING FOR THE MAN DO IT I CAN'T

THE CURRENCY OF THE STATE BANKS WAS WELL-NIGH WORTHLESS BUT IT CONSTITUTED NEARLY THE ONLY CIRCULATING MEDIUM IN THE STATE

THAT CAPTAIN THORNTON AND HIS MEN WERE CAPTURED IN ANOTHER CULTIVATED FIELD
SOME OF THE MORE CONSPICUOUS YORK
SUNDRY SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS WERE ALSO FORMED BY PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS
HARDIN A MAN OF AN UNUSUALLY GALLANT AND CHIVALROUS STRAIN OF CHARACTER
ALSO ADDING HIS EXPLANATORY AFFIDAVIT CONG
HE WAS AT ONCE ACCEPTED AS A PUPIL AND HIS DAYS BEING OTHERWISE EMPLOYED HE GAVE HIS NIGHTS TO READING AND AS HIS VIGILS WERE APT TO BE PROLONGED HE FURNISHED A BEDROOM ADJOINING THE OFFICE WHERE LINCOLN OFTEN PASSED THE NIGHT WITH HIM
SO THAT IN THE ENSUING NEGOTIATIONS ABRAHAM LINCOLN HAD THE ASSISTANCE OF FRIENDS WHOSE FIDELITY AND WHOSE NERVE WERE EQUALLY BEYOND QUESTION
INCIDENTS OF THE COURTS
THE LACK OF DOORS AND FLOORS WAS AT ONCE CORRECTED
WE THOUGHT THAT TO APPEAR TOO KEEN ABOUT IT MIGHT SPUR OUR OPPONENTS ON ABOUT THEIR GENERAL TICKET PROJECT
YOU ARE NOT LAZY AND STILL YOU ARE AN IDLER
126 UPON A TEMPERAMENT THUS PREDISPOSED TO LOOK AT THINGS IN THEIR DARKER ASPECT IT MIGHT NATURALLY BE EXPECTED THAT A LOVE-AFFAIR WHICH WAS NOT PERFECTLY HAPPY WOULD BE PRODUCTIVE OF GREAT MISERY
BUT HE HAD THEN THE SAME NOVELTY AND THE SAME PECULIARITY IN PRESENTING HIS IDEAS
EACH SECTION THEREBY NOT ONLY GAINED TWO VOTES IN THE SENATE BUT ALSO ASSERTED ITS RIGHT TO SPREAD ITS PECULIAR POLITY WITHOUT QUESTION OR HINDRANCE WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED LIMITS
HE THEREUPON MET THE GENTLEMEN PATIENTLY LISTENED TO THE READING OF THE BILL AND THEIR EXPLANATIONS OF IT DECIDED THAT IT RESTED UPON SOUND CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AND RECOGNIZED IN IT ONLY A RETURN TO THAT RULE WHICH HAD BEEN INFRINGED BY THE COMPROMISE OF 1820 AND THE RESTORATION OF WHICH HAD BEEN FORESHADOWED BY THE LEGISLATION OF 1850
BY ALLOWING TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE EVERY POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE THAT THEY COULD HONESTLY AND JUSTLY CLAIM
THE SECOND EQUALLY INDISPENSABLE STEP WAS TO SEIZE THE POLITICAL CONTROL OF THE NEW TERRITORY
THE TEXAS QUESTION
TO THE WAR OF PARTY PRINCIPLES WAS THEREFORE ADDED THE INCENTIVE OF A BRILLIANT OFFICIAL PRIZE
WE ARE AWARE THAT ALL FORMER BIOGRAPHERS HAVE STATED THAT LINCOLN'S CANDIDACY FOR THE LEGISLATURE WAS SUBSEQUENT TO HIS RETURN FROM THE WAR AND A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS SERVICE
THE CIRCUIT LAWYER THE GROWTH AND CHANGE OF LEGAL HABITS
TWO ABORTIVE IMITATIONS OF THE MISSOURI BLUE LODGES SET ON FOOT DURING THE SUMMER BY THE FREE-STATE MEN PROVOKED BY THE ELECTION INVASION IN MARCH FURNISHED THEM A STARTING-POINT FOR MILITARY ORGANIZATION
FOR WOLF-HUNTS WHERE A TALL POLE WAS ERECTED IN THE MIDST OF A PRAIRIE OR CLEARING AND A GREAT CIRCLE OF HUNTERS FORMED AROUND IT SOMETIMES OF MILES IN DIAMETER WHICH GRADUALLY CONTRACTING WITH SHOUTS AND YELLS DROVE ALL THE GAME IN THE WOODS TOGETHER AT THE POLE FOR SLAUGHTER
AMONG HIS MANY QUALITIES OF LEADERSHIP WERE STRONG PHYSICAL ENDURANCE UNTIRING INDUSTRY A PERSISTENT BOLDNESS A READY FACILITY IN PUBLIC SPEAKING UNFAILING POLITICAL SHREWDNESS AN UNUSUAL POWER IN RUNNING DEBATE WITH LIBERAL INSTINCTS AND PROGRESSIVE PURPOSES
WHEN GOLLAHER WAS ELEVEN AND LINCOLN EIGHT THE TWO BOYS WERE IN THE WOODS IN PURSUIT OF PARTRIDGES
ARRIVING WITHIN TWO MILES OF THEIR HABITATION THEY WERE FORCED TO TRUST TO THE INSTINCT OF THEIR ANIMALS AND REACHED HOME HANGING TO THE TAILS OF THEIR STEERS
THE MURDERER A PRO-SLAVERY MAN FIRST FLED TO MISSOURI BUT RETURNED TO SHAWNEE MISSION AND SOUGHT THE OFFICIAL PROTECTION OF SHERIFF JONES
ROBERT LLOYD AT 75 CENTS $3.75
ALSO BASED UPON A CERTAIN HOSTILITY TO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC RELIGION
ONLY A FEW HOURS AFTERWARDS IN A DIGNIFIED AND STATELY NATIONAL CEREMONIAL IN THE MIDST OF FOREIGN MINISTERS JUDGES SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DELIVERED TO THE PEOPLE HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS
THERE WAS HARDLY A VOTE AFTER THE ELECTION OF MR WINTHROP AS SPEAKER WHERE THE TWO SIDES DIVIDED ACCORDING TO THEIR PARTISAN NOMENCLATURE
HE HAD FOR SOME YEARS BEEN PUBLISHING A RELIGIOUS NEWSPAPER IN ST LOUIS BUT FINDING THE ATMOSPHERE OF THAT CITY BECOMING DANGEROUS TO HIM ON ACCOUNT OF THE FREEDOM OF HIS COMMENTS UPON SOUTHERN INSTITUTIONS HE MOVED TO ALTON IN ILLINOIS TWENTY-FIVE MILES FURTHER UP THE RIVER
ONE JOKE IS PRESERVED AND THIS ONE IS AT THE EXPENSE OF LINCOLN
NEALE WAS ELECTED IN 1835 AND IMMEDIATELY APPOINTED LINCOLN AND CALHOUN AS HIS DEPUTIES
HE WAS AS STIFF AS A MAN COULD BE IN HIS WHIG DOCTRINES
DOUGLAS'S ORACULAR STUMP SPEECH IN THE NEBRASKA BILL TRANSFERRED THE STRUGGLE FOR SLAVERY EXTENSION FROM CONGRESS TO THE NEWLY ORGANIZED TERRITORIES
THE SOUTH WAS NOW SOLID AGAINST IT AND SUCH A DISINTEGRATION OF CONSCIENCE AMONG NORTHERN DEMOCRATS HAD SET IN THAT WHEREAS ONLY THREE OF THEM IN THE LAST CONGRESS HAD SEEN FIT TO APPROVE THE INTRODUCTION OF SLAVERY INTO FREE TERRITORY TWENTY-FIVE NOW VOTED WITH THE SOUTH AGAINST MAINTAINING THE EXISTING CONDITIONS THERE
OTHER GRAVE ISSUES INDEED ABSORBED THE PUBLIC ATTENTION BUT THE ABEYANCE OF THE SLAVERY QUESTION IS DUE RATHER TO THE FACT THAT NO CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE AS YET FELL TO EITHER SIDE
THE MURDER OCCURRED NOVEMBER 21
HOW UNHAPPY SUCH A SITUATION FOR A MAN TORMENTED WITH FEAR WHICH IS VAIN IF NO DANGER COMES AND IF IT DOES ONLY AUGMENTS THE PAIN
THE WEATHER BECAME INTENSELY COLD THE MERCURY SINKING TO TWELVE DEGREES BELOW ZERO FAHRENHEIT AND REMAINING THERE FOR TWO WEEKS
BUTTERFIELD HAD A GREAT REPUTATION FOR READY WIT AND WAS SUSPECTED OF DEEP LEARNING
OLD COLONEL ELKIN IS NOMINATED FOR SHERIFF THAT'S RIGHT HARRISON WAS ELECTED IN NOVEMBER AND THE GREAT PREOCCUPATION OF MOST OF THE WHIGS WAS OF COURSE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OFFICES WHICH THEY FELT BELONGED TO THEM AS THE SPOILS OF BATTLE
HE INSTRUCTED THEM THAT THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE BEING AN INSTRUMENT OF CONGRESS AND HAVING PASSED LAWS THESE LAWS ARE OF UNITED STATES AUTHORITY AND MAKING PERSONS RESISTING THESE LAWS MUST BE INDICTED FOR HIGH TREASON
FAC-SIMILE OF MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN JOSHUA SPEED AND WIFE FROM A PAINTING BY HEALY ABOUT 1864
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS REMARKABLE IN THAT IT WAS AN ENTIRELY NEW BILL SUBSTITUTED FOR A FORMER AND ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT SCHEME CONTAINING NO PROHIBITION WHATEVER AND THAT IT WAS PASSED THROUGH ALL THE FORMS AND STAGES OF ENACTMENT IN THE SHORT SPACE OF FOUR DAYS
THEY CAME TOGETHER AT THE CABIN OF JOHN KELLY AT SPRING CREEK
THE MARKET WAS GLUTTED WITH ILLINOIS BONDS
THE MOST NOTABLE OF THESE WAS A BOSTON COMPANY CHARTERED IN APRIL NAMED THE MASSACHUSETTS EMIGRANT AID COMPANY THE CHARTER WAS SOON ABANDONED AND THE COMPANY REORGANIZED JUNE 13TH UNDER PRIVATE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
HE DID NOT LOVE WORK PROBABLY ANY BETTER THAN JOHN JOHNSTON
ORGANIZES THEM ON THE SABINE WHERE SUPPLIES AND ARMS CAN BE CONCENTRATED BEFORE WE HAVE EVEN NOTICE OF HER INTENTIONS
DOUGLAS'S SPEECH BEFORE THE UNION DEMOCRATIC CLUB OF NEW YORK JUNE 3 1854
HIS ELABORATE REPORT ACCOMPANYING THIS SECOND BILL SHOWS THAT THE SUBJECT HAD BEEN MOST CAREFULLY EXAMINED IN COMMITTEE
IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE THIS EFFECT HAD IF ANYTHING BEEN SLIGHTLY REACTIONARY AND THE GREAT CONTEST FOR THE SPEAKERSHIP DURING THE WINTER OF 1855-6 MAY THEREFORE BE TAKEN AS A FAIR MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT OF POLITICS IN 1854
UNTIL UNEXPECTEDLY AND SUDDENLY IT FOUND ITSELF PLUNGED ONCE AGAIN INTO POLITICAL CONTROVERSIES MORE DISTRACTING AND MORE OMINOUS THAN THE WORST IT HAD YET EXPERIENCED
THE DELIBERATE JUDGMENT OF THOSE WHO KNEW HIM HAS HARDENED INTO TRADITION
THE NUMBER UNDER THE NAME OF A STATE INDICATES THE DATE OF ITS ADMISSION INTO THE UNION THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO PREVIOUS TO 1845 1848 IS INDICATED THUS + + + FOR THE PRESENT PARTY DISINTEGRATION WAS SLOW
THAT GREAT FABULIST AND PHILOSOPHER AESOP ILLUSTRATED IT BY HIS FABLE OF THE BUNDLE OF STICKS
FOURTH LITTLE WAS KNOWN OF THE EXTENT OR CHARACTER OF THE GREAT WEST
THIS LAW STANDS PERPETUALLY AND I DO NOT THINK THAT THIS ACT WOULD RECEIVE ANY INCREASED VALIDITY BY A REENACTMENT
JAMES SHIELDS BY THE DOUGLAS-DEMOCRATS
THE REPRIMAND IS PROBABLY THE GENTLEST RECORDED IN THE ANNALS OF PENAL DISCOURSES AND IT SHOWS IN FEW WORDS THE PRINCIPLES WHICH RULED THE CONDUCT OF THIS GREAT AND PEACEABLE MAN
DAY BY DAY THE TEAMS OF THE MOVERS PASSED THROUGH THE ILLINOIS SETTLEMENTS AND WHEREVER THEY HALTED FOR REST AND REFRESHMENT THEY WOULD AFFECT TO DEPLORE THE SHORT-SIGHTED POLICY WHICH BY PROHIBITING SLAVERY HAD PREVENTED THEIR SETTLING IN THAT BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY
BUT THE REFUSAL OF THE WHIGS IN MANY STATES TO SURRENDER THEIR NAME AND ORGANIZATION AND MORE ESPECIALLY THE ABRUPT APPEARANCE OF THE KNOW-NOTHINGS ON THE FIELD OF PARTIES RETARDED THE GENERAL COALITION BETWEEN THE WHIGS AND THE FREE-SOILERS WHICH SO MANY INFLUENCES FAVORED
DR HOLLAND HAS PRESERVED ONE OR TWO INCIDENTS OF THIS KIND WHICH HAVE THEIR VALUE
ITS EMOLUMENTS WERE SLENDER AND ITS DUTIES LIGHT BUT THERE WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY NO CITIZEN OF THE VILLAGE WHO COULD HAVE MADE SO MUCH OF IT AS HE
THE BUCKSKIN DAYS WERE OVER TO A GREAT EXTENT THOUGH AN OCCASIONAL HUNTING-SHIRT AND PAIR OF MOCCASINS WERE STILL SEEN
FINALITY CHAPTER XIX
LET US TURN SLAVERY FROM ITS CLAIMS OF MORAL RIGHT BACK UPON ITS EXISTING LEGAL RIGHTS AND ITS ARGUMENTS OF NECESSITY LET US RETURN IT TO THE POSITION OUR FATHERS GAVE IT AND THERE LET IT REST IN PEACE
THEIR RUSE SUCCEEDED
AS SENATOR REPRESENTATIVE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND DIPLOMATIST HE FILLED THE PUBLIC EYE FOR HALF A CENTURY AND ALTHOUGH HE TWICE PEREMPTORILY RETIRED FROM OFFICE AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS THE MARK OF THE MOST FURIOUS PARTISAN HATRED ALL HIS DAYS NEITHER HIS OWN WEARINESS NOR THE MALICE OF HIS ENEMIES COULD EVER KEEP HIM FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME FROM THAT COMMANDING POSITION FOR WHICH HIS TEMPERAMENT AND HIS NATURE DESIGNED HIM
THE LIFE-BOAT OF COMPROMISE A HOPELESS WRECK
WHILE THE FATE OF THE NEBRASKA BILL HUNG IN A DOUBTFUL BALANCE IN THE HOUSE THE FEELING FOUND EXPRESSION IN LETTERS SPEECHES MEETINGS PETITIONS AND REMONSTRANCES
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH

IT IS TRUE THAT HE DID NOT ALWAYS DISCARD THE WEAPONS OF THE FLESH IN HIS COMBATS WITH THE UNGODLY AND HE FELT MORE THAN ONCE COMPELLED TO LEAVE THE PULPIT TO DO CARNAL EXECUTION UPON THE DISTURBERS OF THE PEACE OF THE SANCTUARY
HE WAS FULL OF WIT WHICH NEVER WOUNDED OF HUMOR WHICH MELLOWED THE HARSHNESS OF THAT NEW AND RAW LIFE OF THE PRAIRIES
IT IS A NOTEWORTHY COINCIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S PROCLAMATION AT THE OPENING OF THE WAR CALLS FOR TROOPS TO REDRESS WRONGS ALREADY LONG ENOUGH ENDURED HAD I BORNE THEM LONGER MY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID
WHY THIS MISSOURI CITIZEN AND FEDERAL OFFICIAL SHOULD IN ADDITION BE CLOTHED WITH A FOREIGN TERRITORIAL SHRIEVALTY OF A COUNTY LYING FORTY OR FIFTY MILES FROM HIS HOME IS A MYSTERY WHICH WAS NEVER EXPLAINED OUTSIDE A MISSOURI BLUE LODGE
WHERE THE FACTS FAVOR OUR ENEMIES WE HAVE RECORDED THEM UNGRUDGINGLY
EACH HAS WRITTEN AN EQUAL PORTION OF THE WORK
FOR WE WILL NEVER KNOW A TRIUMPH WHICH YOU DO NOT SHARE IN LIFE WHOSE GLORY DOES NOT ACCRUE TO YOU IN DEATH RELOCATED FOOTNOTE
THEY SAW THAT MR POLK WAS READY TO RISK EVERYTHING--WAR INTERNATIONAL COMPLICATIONS EVEN THE DISHONOR OF BROKEN OBLIGATIONS TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR PURPOSE AND NOTHING THE WHIG CANDIDATE COULD SAY WOULD WEIGH ANYTHING IN THE BALANCE AGAINST THIS BLIND AND RECKLESS READINESS

YOU CAN TRY IT AGAIN THERE"--A QUIP WHICH HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO MANY WITS IN MANY AGES AND WILL DOUBTLESS MAKE THE REPUTATION OF JESTERS YET TO BE BUT THE FACT IS THAT WITH ALL HIS STORIES AND JESTS HIS FRANK COMPANIONABLE HUMOR HIS GIFT OF EASY ACCESSIBILITY AND WELCOME HE WAS EVEN WHILE HE TRAVELED THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT A MAN OF GRAVE AND SERIOUS TEMPER AND OF AN UNUSUAL INNATE DIGNITY AND RESERVE
53 THE COURTS WHICH WERE HELD IN THESE LOG HUTS WERE AS RUDE AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED
SOME OF THEM HAD RETURNED TO THEIR PLACES ON THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS BRANDISHING THEIR LAURELS WITH GREAT EFFECT IN THE FACES OF THEIR OPPONENTS WHO HAD TALKED WHILE THEY FOUGHT
YOUR MUCH OBLIGED FRIEND AND HUMBLE SERVANT A
WE WERE SURE TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE STORIES FOR WHICH HE ALREADY HAD A REPUTATION AND THERE WAS THIS PECULIARITY ABOUT THEM THAT THEY WERE NOT ONLY ENTERTAINING IN THEMSELVES BUT ALWAYS SINGULARLY ILLUSTRATIVE OF SOME POINT HE WANTED TO MAKE AFTER MR HAY ENTERED HIS OFFICE AND WAS BUSILY ENGAGED WITH HIS BRIEFS AND DECLARATIONS THE COURSE OF THEIR LABORS WAS OFTEN BROKEN BY THE OLDER MAN'S WISE AND WITTY DIGRESSIONS
IN 1848 WHEN I FIRST WENT ON THE BENCH THE CIRCUIT EMBRACED FOURTEEN COUNTIES AND MR LINCOLN WENT WITH THE COURT TO EVERY COUNTY
THEY ON THE OTHER HAND PROFESSING NO PURPOSE BUT THAT OF DEFENSE AND SELF-PROTECTION WERE OBLIGED TO PERMIT FREE AND CONSTANT INGRESS TO THEIR BELEAGUERED TOWN

THERE WAS STILL ANOTHER LINCOLN HANNANIAH BY NAME WHO WAS ALSO INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE BOONES
THEIR IMPROVISED COURTS AND COUNCILS ADMINISTERED LAW AND EQUITY
THEY HAVE GONE THE WAY OF ALL BUNCOMBE
THEY CUT THE TIMBER WITH FRONTIER INNOCENCE FROM CONGRESS LAND AND SOON HAD A SERVICEABLE CRAFT AFLOAT WITH WHICH THEY DESCENDED THE CURRENT OF THE SANGAMON TO NEW SALEM A LITTLE VILLAGE WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BORN FOR THE OCCASION AS IT CAME INTO EXISTENCE JUST BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF LINCOLN NOURISHED FOR SEVEN YEARS WHILE HE REMAINED ONE OF ITS CITIZENS AND DIED SOON AFTER HE WENT AWAY
A LETTER TO LINCOLN WAS DRAWN UP AND SIGNED BY SOME HALF-DOZEN OF THE LEADING WHIGS OF THE STATE ASKING HIM TO BECOME AN APPLICANT FOR THAT POSITION
FOR RESISTING AN OFFICER ARRESTING A FUGITIVE SLAVE TWO YEARS IMPRISONMENT
BATTLING WHILE OTHERS FEASTED SOWING WHERE OTHERS REAPED ABANDONED BY HIS ALLIES AND PERSECUTED BY HIS FRIENDS DOUGLAS ALONE EMERGED FROM THE FIGHT WITH LOYAL FAITH AND UNSHAKEN COURAGE BRINGING WITH HIM THROUGH TREACHERY DEFEAT AND DISASTER THE UNFLINCHING ALLEGIANCE AND ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRATION OF NEARLY THREE-FIFTHS OF THE RANK AND FILE OF THE ONCE VICTORIOUS ARMY OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS AT THE NORTH
ABRAHAM NEVER LOST SIGHT OF HIS PARENTS
HIS FEW SPEECHES IN THE ADJOINING COUNTIES HAD SHOWN THEM HIS MATURING INTELLECT HIS EXPANDING POWER IN DEBATE
SHIELDS SUFFERED HIMSELF TO BE PERSUADED TO WITHDRAW HIS OFFENSIVE CHALLENGE
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE OPINIONS AND THOSE CONTAINED IN THE SAID RESOLUTIONS IS THEIR REASON FOR ENTERING THIS PROTEST REASON ENOUGH FOR THE LINCOLNS AND LUTHERS
WE DEFENDED OUR VOTE BEFORE OUR CONSTITUENTS BY SAYING THAT NECESSITY WOULD ULTIMATELY FORCE THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT TO A CENTRAL POSITION
LINCOLN'S WHIG FRIENDS HAD THEREFORE SEEN HIS REAPPEARANCE IN ACTIVE DISCUSSION WITH UNFEIGNED PLEASURE
IT WAS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD TO BE THE DESIRE OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT HOSTILITIES SHOULD BEGIN WITHOUT ORDERS BY A SPECIES OF SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION
THE SOUTH WAS NEARLY UNITED IN ITS BEHALF THE NORTH SADLY DIVIDED IN OPPOSITION
MR PALFREY OF MASSACHUSETTS A FEW DAYS LATER SAID WITH AS MUCH SAGACITY AS WIT THAT MR CALHOUN THOUGHT THAT HE COULD SET FIRE TO A BARREL OF GUNPOWDER AND EXTINGUISH IT WHEN HALF CONSUMED IN HIS ANXIETY THAT THE WAR SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO AN END CALHOUN PROPOSED THAT THE UNITED STATES ARMY SHOULD EVACUATE THE MEXICAN CAPITAL ESTABLISH A DEFENSIVE LINE AND HOLD IT AS THE ONLY INDEMNITY POSSIBLE TO US
BUT WEDDINGS WHICH WERE ENTERTAINMENTS SCARCELY LESS RUDE AND BOISTEROUS WERE THEIR OWN PECULIAR PROVINCE
BUT HE HAD AN INNATE SELF-RESPECT AND A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HIS SELF WAS WORTHY OF RESPECT THAT KEPT HIM FROM IDLENESS AS IT KEPT HIM FROM ALL OTHER VICES AND MADE HIM A BETTER MAN EVERY YEAR THAT HE LIVED
AFTER HIS STORE TO USE HIS OWN EXPRESSION HAD WINKED OUT HE APPLIED HIMSELF WITH MORE CONTINUOUS ENERGY TO HIS READING DOING MERELY WHAT ODD JOBS CAME TO HIS HAND TO PAY HIS CURRENT EXPENSES WHICH WERE OF COURSE VERY SLIGHT
HE HAD THAT OLD-FASHIONED LAWYER-LIKE MORALITY WHICH WAS KEENLY INTOLERANT OF ANY LAXITY OR SLOVENLINESS OF MIND OR CHARACTER
HIS GOOD QUALITIES MIGHT HAVE EXCITED RESENTMENT IF DISPLAYED BY A WELL-DRESSED STRANGER FROM AN EASTERN STATE BUT THE MOST UNCOUTH RUFFIANS OF NEW SALEM TOOK A SORT OF PROPRIETARY INTEREST AND PRIDE IN THE DECENCY AND THE CLEVERNESS AND THE LEARNING OF THEIR FRIEND AND COMRADE ABE LINCOLN
AMONG THE TOASTS ON THESE OCCASIONS WERE TWO WHICH WE MAY TRANSCRIBE
BEARING THIS IN MIND I EXPRESS MY PREFERENCE IN A FEW CASES AS FOLLOWS
PERHAPS THEY EVEN RESISTED THE CONTAMINATION OF CARDS AND DRINK PROFANITY AND REVOLVER SALUTATIONS WHILE THE GILDED AND TINSELED MISSOURI RIVER STEAMBOAT BORE THEM FOR THREE DAYS AGAINST ITS MUDDY CURRENT AND BOILING EDDIES TO MEET THEIR COMPANY AND THEIR OUTFIT
REAL ABILITY THEN IMPOSED ITSELF WITH MORE AUTHORITY UPON THE IGNORANT AND UNPRETENDING POLITICIANS FROM THE BACK TIMBER
THE ONLY SIGNIFICANCE THE EPISODE POSSESSES IS IN SHOWING THIS ALMOST ABNORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF CONSCIENCE IN THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS PERFECTLY READY TO ENTER INTO A MARRIAGE WHICH HE DREADED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HAD GIVEN A YOUNG WOMAN REASON TO THINK THAT HE HAD SUCH INTENTIONS
YET IT WAS HER GENIAL MANNER AND EVER-KIND WELCOME AND MR LINCOLN'S WIT AND HUMOR ANECDOTE AND UNRIVALED CONVERSATION WHICH FORMED THE CHIEF ATTRACTION HERE WE LEAVE HIM FOR A WHILE IN THIS PEACEFUL AND LABORIOUS PERIOD OF HIS LIFE
IT WAS A WELL WRITTEN CIRCULAR REMARKABLE FOR ITS SOBERNESS AND RESERVE WHEN WE CONSIDER THE AGE AND THE LIMITED ADVANTAGES OF THE WRITER
THE STRENGTH OF THE PRECEDING HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WHICH MET IN DECEMBER 1853 HAD BEEN
HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS THOSE WHOM HE LOVED AND HONORED WERE BROWNING BUTLER LOGAN AND STUART--KENTUCKIANS ALL AND STRONGLY AVERSE TO ANY DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY
HE IMMEDIATELY WEIGHED OUT THE QUANTITY OF TEA OF WHICH HE HAD INNOCENTLY DEFRAUDED HIS CUSTOMER AND WENT IN SEARCH OF HER HIS SENSITIVE CONSCIENCE NOT PERMITTING ANY DELAY

DAVID LOGAN WAS A SERGEANT IN BAKER'S REGIMENT
IF GENERAL CASS WENT IN ADVANCE OF ME PICKING WHORTLEBERRIES I GUESS I SURPASSED HIM IN CHARGES ON THE WILD ONIONS
ARKANSAS WAS ALSO BEING NURSED AS AN APPLICANT AND THE PROSPECTIVE LOSS BY THE NORTH AND GAIN BY THE SOUTH OF THE BALANCE OF POWER CAUSED THE SLAVERY QUESTION SUDDENLY TO FLARE UP AS A NATIONAL ISSUE
DOUGLAS ONCE TRAVELED FROM SPRINGFIELD TO BLOOMINGTON AND MADE AN EXTRAVAGANT SPEECH AND HAVING GAINED HIS CASE RECEIVED A FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS

OWEN LOVEJOY FROM A PHOTOGRAPH
THE COUNTY RECORDS SHOW HIM TO HAVE BEEN THE POSSESSOR OF A DOMAIN OF SOME SEVENTEEN HUNDRED ACRES
ALL THE LITTLE LEARNING HE EVER ACQUIRED HE SEIZED AS A TOOL TO BETTER HIS CONDITION
A RURAL BULLY HAVING MADE HIMSELF ESPECIALLY OFFENSIVE ONE DAY WHEN WOMEN WERE PRESENT BY LOUD PROFANITY LINCOLN REQUESTED HIM TO BE SILENT
THE VIRGINIANS AND KENTUCKIANS READILY BECAME CONVERTS TO THE THRIFT AND ORDER OF FREE SOCIETY
THESE SENTIMENTS CAME WITH THE FIRST AWAKENING OF HIS MIND AND CONSCIENCE AND WERE ROUSED INTO ACTIVE LIFE AND ENERGY BY THE SIGHT OF FELLOW-CREATURES IN CHAINS ON AN OHIO RIVER STEAMBOAT AND ON THE WHARF AT NEW ORLEANS
IT WAS THEREFORE IMAGINED THAT HE WAS PERMEATED WITH SECRET HOSTILITY TO REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS
IN PROCESS OF TIME THEREFORE NORTHERN ILLINOIS BECAME PEOPLED WITH SETTLERS FROM NORTHERN OR FREE STATES BRINGING THEIR ANTISLAVERY TRADITIONS AND FEELINGS

LENGTHY FOOTNOTE 1 RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END WITH ALL HIS DEVOTION TO THE CAUSE OF HIS CHURCH PETER CARTWRIGHT WAS AN ARDENT JACKSON POLITICIAN WITH PROBABLY A LARGER ACQUAINTANCE THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT THAN ANY OTHER MAN IN IT AND WITH A PERSONAL FOLLOWING WHICH BEGINNING WITH HIS OWN CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AND EXTENDING THROUGH EVERY PRECINCT MADE IT NO HOLIDAY TASK TO DEFEAT HIM IN A POPULAR CONTEST

WITH THESE AS FATHERS OF THE FAITH AND THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS AN APOSTLE TO PREACH A NEW CRUSADE IS IT ASTONISHING THAT THERE WAS NO LACK OF LISTENERS CONVERTS AND VOLUNTEERS
THAT UNION IS STRENGTH IS A TRUTH THAT HAS BEEN KNOWN ILLUSTRATED AND DECLARED IN VARIOUS WAYS AND FORMS IN ALL AGES OF THE WORLD
HARDIN HE WROTE IS A MAN OF DESPERATE ENERGY AND PERSEVERANCE AND ONE THAT NEVER BACKS OUT
DRAPER ESQ SECRETARY OF THE WISCONSIN HISTORICAL SOCIETY AND ERRONEOUSLY SUPPOSED BY SOME TO HAVE BEEN IN MERCER COUNTY

YOU KNOW I AM NEVER SANGUINE
WASHBURNE FEBRUARY 9 1855
EVERY ACQUAINTANCE HE MADE BECAME HIS FRIEND AND EVEN BEFORE THE END OF HIS UNSUCCESSFUL CANVASS IN 1832 IT HAD BECOME EVIDENT TO THE OBSERVANT POLITICIANS OF THE DISTRICT THAT HE WAS A MAN WHOM IT WOULD NOT DO TO LEAVE OUT OF THEIR CALCULATIONS
HER HONEST PRIDE INSPIRED HER HUSBAND TO GREATER THRIFT AND INDUSTRY
THE LATTER THE HISTORY OF WHOSE CAPTURE WITH CASSIUS CLAY YOU WELL KNOW HAD NOT ARRIVED HERE WHEN THAT VOTE WAS GIVEN
BUT WHEN HIS EMPLOYER'S DAY WAS OVER HIS OWN BEGAN
SOME OF THESE TERMINAL CITIES WERE NOT IN EXISTENCE EXCEPT UPON NEATLY DESIGNED SURVEYOR'S MAPS
THE FOURTH PROVIDES FOR THE MANUMISSION OF SLAVES BY THE GOVERNMENT ON APPLICATION OF THE OWNERS THE LATTER TO RECEIVE THEIR FULL CASH VALUE
PRISONERS WERE LIBERATED AND WITH THE OPPORTUNE AID OF A FURIOUS RAIN-STORM THE BORDER-RUFFIAN ARMY GRADUALLY MELTED AWAY
THE COLONELS WERE HARDIN BISSELL AND FORMAN AND AN ADDITIONAL REGIMENT OFFERED BY BAKER WAS THEN ACCEPTED
THE NATION WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE HIM AS THE MIGHTY COUNSELOR WHOSE PATIENT COURAGE AND WISDOM SAVED THE LIFE OF THE REPUBLIC IN ITS DARKEST HOUR

THIS IS AN AXIOM WHICH MAY BE APPLIED TO MOST CITIES IN A CERTAIN SENSE BUT IT IS TRUE IN A PECULIAR DEGREE OF OUR CAPITAL
THAT STILL KILLS MY SOUL
THERE WERE CHARTERS FOR RAILROADS INSURANCE COMPANIES TOLL-BRIDGES FERRIES COAL-MINES PLANK ROADS AND NUMBERLESS PRIVILEGES AND HONORS OF PRESENT OR PROSPECTIVE VALUE OUT OF WHICH TOGETHER WITH THE COUNTY DISTRICT AND MILITARY OFFICES THE AMBITIOUS MEMBERS MIGHT GIVE AND TAKE WITH GENEROUS LIBERALITY
AND THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE AT SHAWNEE MISSION WAS THEREFORE IN A CERTAIN SENSE UNDER ITS OWN VINE AND FIG-TREE ILLUSTRATION
MEN WOULD FIGHT FOR THE LOVE OF IT AND THEN SHAKE HANDS AND BE FRIENDS

COLLAPSE OF THE SYSTEM LINCOLN IN SPRINGFIELD
ON THE OTHER HAND THE GREAT MASS OF NORTHERN WHIGS PROMPTLY OPPOSED THE REPEAL AND FORMED THE BULK OF THE OPPOSITION NEVERTHELESS LOSING PERHAPS AS MANY PRO-SLAVERY WHIGS AS THEY GAINED ANTISLAVERY DEMOCRATS
275 276 IN THE SOUTHERN STATES ALSO THIS PROPAGANDISM WAS ACTIVE AND A NUMBER OF GUERRILLA LEADERS WITH FOLLOWERS RECRUITED IN THE SOUTH AND ARMED AND SUSTAINED BY SOUTHERN CONTRIBUTIONS AND APPROPRIATIONS FOUND THEIR WAY TO KANSAS IN RESPONSE TO URGENT APPEALS OF THE BORDER CHIEFS
THOMAS TO WHOM WERE RESERVED THE HONORS OF AN ILLUSTRIOUS PATERNITY LEARNED THE TRADE OF A CARPENTER
LARGE FAMILIES LIVED IN LOG HUTS PUT TOGETHER WITHOUT IRON AND FAR MORE OPEN TO THE INCLEMENCIES OF THE SKIES THAN THE PIG-STYES OF THE CAREFUL FARMER OF TO-DAY
AT THE SAME SESSION A LAW WAS PASSED CONFISCATING THE PROPERTY OF CERTAIN BRITISH SUBJECTS FOR THE ENDOWMENT OF AN INSTITUTION OF LEARNING IN KENTUCKY IT BEING THE INTEREST OF THIS COMMONWEALTH TO QUOTE THE LANGUAGE OF THE PHILOSOPHIC LEGISLATURE ALWAYS TO ENCOURAGE AND PROMOTE EVERY DESIGN WHICH MAY TEND TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE MIND AND THE DIFFUSION OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE EVEN AMONG ITS REMOTE CITIZENS WHOSE SITUATION IN A BARBAROUS NEIGHBORHOOD AND A SAVAGE INTERCOURSE MIGHT OTHERWISE RENDER THEM UNFRIENDLY TO SCIENCE THIS WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE TRANSYLVANIA UNIVERSITY OF LEXINGTON WHICH ROSE AND FLOURISHED FOR MANY YEARS ON THE UTMOST VERGE OF CIVILIZATION

I ONLY WANT WHAT JINES MINE WHENEVER A REGION CONTIGUOUS TO THE UNITED STATES BECOMES FILLED WITH AMERICANS IT IS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN TO COME UNDER THE AMERICAN FLAG
BUT LINCOLN WHO WAS VERY STRONG IN THE OUTLYING COUNTIES OF THE DISTRICT DECLINED THE PROPOSITION ALLEGING AS A REASON FOR REFUSING THAT HARDIN WAS SO MUCH BETTER KNOWN THAN HE BY REASON OF HIS SERVICE IN CONGRESS THAT SUCH A STIPULATION WOULD GIVE HIM A GREAT ADVANTAGE
DOUGLAS SENATE SPEECH 1850
32 IN THE SENATE TOO THE APPLICATION WAS ALREADY PREJUDGED
TO HAVE PREDICTED THAT TO-DAY A LEGISLATURE WOULD ASSEMBLE ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY PRO-SLAVERY AND WITH MYSELF FOR SPEAKER I WOULD HAVE BEEN THOUGHT MAD THE PROGRAMME HAD ALREADY BEEN ANNOUNCED IN THE SQUATTER SOVEREIGN SOME WEEKS BEFORE
OCCASIONALLY AN ITINERANT PREACHER VISITED A COUNTY AND THE SETTLERS FOR MILES AROUND WOULD GO NEARLY IN MASS TO THE MEETING
THE VICTORY OF BOONE AT BOONESBORO AGAINST THE SHAWNEES AND THE CAPTURE OF KASKASKIA AND VINCENNES BY THE BRILLIANT AUDACITY OF GEORGE ROGERS CLARK HAD BROUGHT THE REGION PROMINENTLY TO THE ATTENTION OF THE ATLANTIC STATES AND HAD TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION THE RESTLESS AND ROVING SPIRITS WHICH ARE ALWAYS FOUND IN COMMUNITIES AT PERIODS WHEN GREAT EMIGRATIONS ARE A NEED OF CIVILIZATION
THE RIDGELYS BROUGHT THEIR BANKING BUSINESS FROM MARYLAND
THEY HAD ENDURED TOGETHER THE TRIALS OF PIONEER LIFE
SUMNER TO SHANNON MAY 12 1856
LINCOLN IN A LETTER TO SPEED WRITTEN IN MAY SAID
BUT HIS SPEECH WAS CONSIDERED THE BEST OF THE SERIES AND THERE WAS SUCH A DEMAND FOR IT THAT HE WROTE IT OUT AND IT WAS PRINTED AND CIRCULATED IN THE SPRING AS A CAMPAIGN DOCUMENT
THE CONTEST BETWEEN WHITFIELD AND REEDER FOR A SEAT IN THE HOUSE AS TERRITORIAL DELEGATE NOT ONLY PROVOKED SEARCHING DISCUSSION BUT FURNISHED THE OCCASION FOR SENDING AN INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE TO KANSAS ATTENDED BY THE CONTESTANTS IN PERSON
IT IS ALSO RELATED THAT HE COULD RAISE A BARREL OF WHISKY FROM THE GROUND AND DRINK FROM THE BUNG--BUT THE NARRATOR ADDS THAT HE NEVER SWALLOWED THE WHISKY
IT WAS A DAILY SPECTACLE WHICH NEVER LOST ITS STRANGENESS FOR THE TENNESSEEANS AND KENTUCKIANS TO SEE THE FRENCHMAN RETURNING FROM HIS WORK GREETED BY HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WITH EMBRACES OF WELCOME AT THE GATE OF HIS DOOR-YARD AND IN VIEW OF ALL THE VILLAGERS THE NATURAL AND KINDLY FRATERNIZATION OF THE FRENCHMEN WITH THE INDIANS WAS ALSO A CAUSE OF WONDER TO THE AMERICANS
THE STORY RESTS ON THE STATEMENT OF A SINGLE PERSON MRS SARAH GRAHAM ONE MORNING IN THE YEAR 1784 HE STARTED WITH HIS THREE SONS MORDECAI JOSIAH AND THOMAS TO THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING AND BEGAN THE DAY'S WORK
SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE OLD SOLDIER POUR IN WITHOUT ABATEMENT
REEDER AND JAMES H
IT WAS A DISMAL AND DISHEARTENING TASK
WE KNOW OF ONLY ONE OTHER HOSTILE LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM
FROM THIS MOMENT THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT PUBLIC MEETINGS APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEES APPEALS FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS AND A SCATTERING FIRE OF ADVERTISEMENTS OF GOODS AND FREIGHT TO BE BARGAINED FOR,--WHICH SUSTAINED THE PREVAILING INTEREST
THE SHARPEST ASSAULT IT HAD TO ENDURE HOWEVER WAS IN A COMMUNICATION DATED AUGUST 27 AND PRINTED IN THE SANGAMO JOURNAL OF SEPTEMBER 2 NOT ONLY DISSECTING THE ADMINISTRATION CIRCULAR WITH THE MOST SAVAGE SATIRE BUT COVERING THE AUDITOR WITH MERCILESS PERSONAL RIDICULE
THE TITLE HOWEVER REMAINED IN HIM ONLY A LITTLE WHILE AND AFTER HIS PROPERTY HAD PASSED OUT OF HIS CONTROL HE LOOKED ABOUT FOR ANOTHER PLACE TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF
SINCE THERE IS NO ESCAPING YOUR CHALLENGE I ACCEPT IT IN BEHALF OF FREEDOM
I HAVE BEEN TO THE SECRETARY'S OFFICE WITHIN THE LAST HOUR AND FIND THINGS PRECISELY AS YOU LEFT THEM
THE LOWER COUNTRY FALLS WITH IT NEW ORLEANS
HOMER REPRESENTS HECTOR AS STRONGLY DOUBTING THE EXPEDIENCY OF THE WAR AGAINST GREECE
WHEN ABE AND I RETURNED TO THE HOUSE FROM WORK HE WOULD GO TO THE CUPBOARD SNATCH A PIECE OF CORN-BREAD TAKE DOWN A BOOK SIT DOWN COCK HIS LEGS UP AS HIGH AS HIS HEAD AND READ THE PICTURE MAY BE LACKING IN GRACE BUT ITS TRUTHFULNESS IS BEYOND QUESTION
THOMAS L
21 1854
THERE IS SURELY NOTHING ALIEN TO ORDINARY MORTALITY IN THIS
HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO REST EVEN IN HIS GRAVE
LAWYERS AND POLITICIANS
STILL LESS CAN HE AFFORD TO TAKE ALL THE CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING THE VITIATING OF HIS TEMPER AND THE LOSS OF SELF-CONTROL
HE WAS NOMINATED AND DEFEATED
THE PREACHER WOULD THEN TAKE OFF HIS COAT AND GO AT HIS WORK WITH AN ENERGY UNKNOWN TO OUR DAYS
ATCHISON FROM A DAGUERREOTYPE
IN THE CHANGE OF HANDS ALL THE HUMOR OF THE THING HAD EVAPORATED AND NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT FEMININE MISCHIEF ON ONE SIDE AND THE EXASPERATION OF WOUNDED VANITY ON THE OTHER
THE FIRST PROMISE OF THE GREAT ENTERPRISE APPEARS IN THE SANGSMO JOURNAL OF JANUARY 26 1832 IN A LETTER FROM THE CAPTAIN AT CINCINNATI SAYING HE WOULD ASCEND THE SANGAMON BY STEAM ON THE BREAKING UP OF THE ICE
MR WILLIAM BUTLER TELLS US THAT ON ONE OCCASION WHEN LINCOLN WAS A FARMHAND AT ISLAND GROVE THE FAMOUS CIRCUIT-RIDER PETER CARTWRIGHT CAME BY ELECTIONEERING FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND LINCOLN AT ONCE ENGAGED IN A DISCUSSION WITH HIM IN THE CORNFIELD IN WHICH THE GREAT METHODIST WAS EQUALLY ASTONISHED AT THE CLOSE REASONING AND THE UNCOUTH FIGURE OF MR BROWN'S EXTRAORDINARY HIRED MAN
I WAS NOT CONSULTED ON THE SUBJECT NOR WAS I APPRISED OF THE APPOINTMENT UNTIL I DISCOVERED IT BY ACCIDENT TWO OR THREE WEEKS AFTERWARDS
THE REST REACHED DIXON BY TWOS AND THREES RESTED ALL NIGHT AND TOOK COURAGE
IN COUNCIL AND IN WAR HE WAS EQUALLY VALUABLE
ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTI NEBRASKA FORCE EXCEPTING JUDD COOK PALMER BAKER AND ALLEN OF MADISON AND TWO OR THREE OF THE SECRET MATTESON MEN WOULD GO INTO CAUCUS AND I COULD GET THE NOMINATION OF THAT CAUCUS
BUT IF THE NEGRO IS A MAN IS IT NOT TO THAT EXTENT A TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF SELF-GOVERNMENT TO SAY THAT HE TOO SHALL NOT GOVERN HIMSELF
BUT OF SUCH IMPORTANCE DID HE DEEM THE SUCCESS OF THE CONSPIRACY IN WHICH HE WAS THE LEADER THAT A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE SESSION HE WROTE A SHORT LETTER TO THE SENATE GIVING NOTICE OF HIS PROBABLE ABSENCE AND ADVISING THE APPOINTMENT OF A NEW PRESIDING OFFICER
LOANS WERE EFFECTED WITH SURPRISING AND FATAL FACILITY AND BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR WORK HAD BEGUN AT MANY POINTS ON THE RAILROADS
THE GREAT PREACHER PETER CARTWRIGHT USED TO DENOUNCE EASTERN MEN ROUNDLY IN HIS SERMONS CALLING THEM IMPS WHO LIVED ON OYSTERS INSTEAD OF HONEST CORN-BREAD AND BACON

THE NOISE AND EXCITEMENT CREATED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE KANSAS NEBRASKA ACT AWAKENED THE HOPE OF FRONTIER TRADERS AND SPECULATORS WHO NOW GREEDILY WATCHED ALL THE BUDDING CHANCES OF GAIN
ON THE QUESTION OF LIBERTY AS A PRINCIPLE WE ARE NOT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN
THE REAL FACT IS THAT MR GIDDINGS THEN IN CONGRESS WROTE TO LOVEJOY AND OTHERS TO SUPPORT LINCOLN
BUT THIS QUASI-TOLERATION OF THE INSTITUTION WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE ADVOCATES OF SLAVERY
HE USED TO SAY THAT HE HAD VOTED FOR THE WILMOT PROVISO IN ITS VARIOUS PHASES FORTY-TWO TIMES
THE GOVERNOR HAD REMOVED HIS EXECUTIVE OFFICE TO SHAWNEE MISSION

SQUIRE BOONE THE FATHER OF DANIEL WAS ONE OF THE APPRAISERS WHO MADE THE INVENTORY OF MORDECAI LINCOLN'S ESTATE
THEY HAD THE UNUSUAL HONOR WHILE THEY WERE STILL COMPARATIVELY YOUNG MEN OF SEEING THEIR NAMES INDISSOLUBLY ASSOCIATED IN THE MAP OF THEIR STATE AS A MEMORIAL TO FUTURE AGES OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND THEIR FAME IN THE COUNTY OF LOGAN OF WHICH THE CITY OF LINCOLN IS THE COUNTY-SEAT
HERE IS A SPECIMEN WHICH IS SHORT ENOUGH TO GIVE ENTIRE
FENCES BUILT WHEN THERE WAS NO MOON WOULD GIVE WAY
DR ANSON JONES HAD BEEN ELECTED AS PRESIDENT OF TEXAS
LOGAN WHO HAD EXPECTED THAT LINCOLN'S CHIEF VALUE TO HIM WOULD BE AS A TALKING ADVOCATE BEFORE JURIES WAS SURPRISED AND PLEASED TO FIND HIS NEW PARTNER RAPIDLY BECOMING A LAWYER
THEY WOULD COMPEL THE MOUNTAIN TO GO TO MAHOMET
AS TO ARMSTRONG HE WAS LINCOLN'S FRIEND AND SWORN BROTHER AS SOON AS HE RECOVERED THE USE OF HIS LARYNX AND THE BOND THUS STRANGELY CREATED LASTED THROUGH LIFE
ON THE 6TH OF APRIL ONE WEEK AFTER ELECTION THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED HIS DECISION UPON THE RETURNS
IF YOU WENT THROUGH THE CEREMONY CALMLY OR EVEN WITH SUFFICIENT COMPOSURE NOT TO EXCITE ALARM IN ANY PRESENT YOU ARE SAFE BEYOND QUESTION SEEKING BY EVERY DEVICE OF SUBTLE AFFECTION TO LIFT UP THE HEART OF HIS FRIEND
AND WILLIAM BUTLER AFTERWARDS PROMINENT IN STATE POLITICS AT THAT TIME A YOUNG MAN OF THE PUREST WESTERN BREED IN BODY AND CHARACTER CLEAR-HEADED AND COURAGEOUS AND READY FOR ANY EMERGENCY WHERE A FRIEND WAS TO BE DEFENDED OR AN ENEMY PUNISHED
THEIR DRESS WAS STILL MOSTLY OF TANNED DEER-HIDE A MATERIAL TO THE LAST DEGREE UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN THE WEARER WAS CAUGHT IN A SHOWER
WHAT CAN YOU DO IN MISSOURI BETTER THAN HERE
AFTER HE CEASED TO BE AUDITOR HE WAS ELECTED A JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS

HARRISON WHO GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCES IN LAMON P
OPERATING IN ENTIRE SECRECY THE COUNTRY WAS STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE IN ONE LOCALITY AFTER ANOTHER ON ELECTION DAY OF A POTENT AND UNSUSPECTED POLITICAL POWER WHICH IN MANY INSTANCES PUSHED BOTH THE OLD ORGANIZATIONS NOT ONLY TO DISASTROUS BUT EVEN TO RIDICULOUS DEFEAT
THE EXPEDITION WITH WHICH HE LEFT THE YADKIN IN 1773 MET WITH A TERRIBLE DISASTER NEAR CUMBERLAND GAP IN WHICH HIS ELDEST SON AND FIVE MORE YOUNG MEN WERE KILLED BY INDIANS AND THE WHOLE PARTY DISCOURAGED BY THE BLOW RETIRED TO THE SAFER REGION OF CLINCH RIVER

TEN YEARS AFTER THIS HE MADE ANOTHER JOURNEY BY WATER WITH HIS FRIEND JOSHUA SPEED OF KENTUCKY

THE PEOPLE OF LAWRENCE DENOUNCED THE DEED
LEAF FROM ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S EXERCISE BOOK
THERE WAS A RACE FOR THE WHISKY BOTTLE
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO EXCITE AMBITION FOR EDUCATION BUT IN THE CASE OF THIS UNGAINLY BOY THERE WAS NO NECESSITY OF ANY EXTERNAL INCENTIVE
IF WE WOULD CORRECTLY UNDERSTAND HOW LINCOLN BECAME FIRST A CONSPICUOUS ACTOR AND THEN A CHOSEN LEADER IN A GREAT STRIFE OF NATIONAL PARTIES FOR SUPREMACY AND POWER WE MUST BRIEFLY STUDY THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREAT SLAVERY CONTROVERSY IN AMERICAN LEGISLATION WHICH FOUND ITS HIGHEST ACTIVITY AND DECISIVE CULMINATION IN THE SINGLE DECADE FROM 1850 TO 1860
THE VIRGINIA PRICE OF A MALE FIELD HAND IN 1790 WAS $250
IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT HIS LETTERS GAINED OR SAVED HIM A VOTE IN THE SOUTH AMONG THE ADVOCATES OF ANNEXATION
THE CONDITIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF WHICH WE SPEAK WERE BROADLY NATIONAL AND OPEN TO ALL WITHOUT RESTRICTION OF RANK OR LOCALITY
I HATE IT BECAUSE OF THE MONSTROUS INJUSTICE OF SLAVERY ITSELF
LOSING NOTHING OF HIS GENIAL HUMOR HIS CHARACTER TOOK ON THE DIGNITY OF A GRAVER MANHOOD
SANGAMON JOURNAL NOVEMBER 7 1835 SIDENOTE
IT WAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT MALEFACTORS WOULD COME AND THE CONSTABLES HAVE EMPLOYMENT
THEY INGENIOUSLY PROLONGED THE TENURE OF THEIR VARIOUS APPOINTEES AND TO RENDER THEIR SUCCESS AT FUTURE ELECTIONS EASY AND CERTAIN THEY PROVIDED THAT CANDIDATES TO BE ELIGIBLE AND JUDGES OF ELECTION AND VOTERS WHEN CHALLENGED MUST SWEAR TO SUPPORT THE FUGITIVE-SLAVE LAW

IT IS NOT FAIR FOR YOU TO ASSUME THAT I HAVE NO INTEREST IN A THING WHICH HAS AND CONTINUALLY EXERCISES THE POWER OF MAKING ME MISERABLE THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL INGENIOUS ATTEMPTS TO SHOW THE ORIGIN AND OCCASION OF MR LINCOLN'S ANTISLAVERY CONVICTIONS

LOCAL RIVALRIES FORCED THE SELECTION OF AN UNPOPULAR CANDIDATE
DEATH OF LOVEJOY
IT NEEDS ONLY THIS STATEMENT TO REFUTE THE POLITICAL SLANDER SO INDUSTRIOUSLY REPEATED IN HIGH PLACES AGAINST THE LAWRENCE IMMIGRANTS
BUT IT MAY NOT BE FANCIFUL TO SUPPOSE THAT CHARACTERS LIKE THAT OF LINCOLN ELECTED FOR GREAT CONFLICTS AND TRIALS ARE FASHIONED BY DIFFERENT PROCESSES FROM THOSE OF ORDINARY MEN AND PASS THEIR STATED ORDEALS IN A DIFFERENT WAY
IF THE SOUTHERN PEOPLE BUT HALF DO THEIR DUTY IN LESS THAN NINE MONTHS FROM THIS DAY KANSAS WILL HAVE FORMED A CONSTITUTION AND BE KNOCKING AT THE DOOR FOR ADMISSION
IN REPLY THE CROWD GROANED HOOTED YELLED AND MADE THE DIN OF PANDEMONIUM
THOSE WHO HELD SLAVES ASSUMED A DISTINCT SOCIAL SUPERIORITY OVER THOSE WHO DID NOT
THE ANTISLAVERY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE MADE UP A PURSE OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS
AND THE BETTER TO IMPRESS THIS PROPOSITION HE USES A FIGURATIVE EXPRESSION IN THESE WORDS THE DEMOCRATS ARE VULNERABLE IN THE HEEL BUT THEY ARE SOUND IN THE HEART AND HEAD THE FIRST BRANCH OF THE FIGURE--THAT IS THE DEMOCRATS ARE VULNERABLE IN THE HEEL--I ADMIT IS NOT MERELY FIGURATIVELY BUT LITERALLY TRUE
THE GREATEST PRIVATION WAS THE LACK OF STEEL IMPLEMENTS
THIS IS NOT THE ANXIETY OF A POLITICIAN TROUBLED ABOUT HIS RECORD

IT WAS CRUEL IT WAS ARISTOCRATIC
237 IN THIS WAY BEGAN MR LINCOLN'S RESIDENCE IN SPRINGFIELD WHERE HE WAS TO REMAIN UNTIL CALLED TO ONE OF THE HIGHEST OF DESTINIES INTRUSTED TO MEN AND WHERE HIS ASHES WERE TO REST FOREVER IN MONUMENTAL MARBLE
THEY SUCCEEDED IN INDUCING THE CONVENTION TO ADOPT THE TWO-THIRDS RULE AFTER A WHOLE DAY OF STORMY DEBATE AND THE DEFEAT OF VAN BUREN WAS SECURED
THEY WERE BUSY ALL DAY LONG SPURRING UP THE LAGGING AND INDIFFERENT AND BRINGING THE AGED THE INFIRM AND THE DISTANT VOTERS IN VEHICLES
THE PAPERS HE READ WERE THE LOUISVILLE JOURNAL AND THE SANGAMO JOURNAL BOTH WHIG
AT TIMES HE MADE STATEMENTS WHICH BROUGHT SENATOR DOUGLAS TO HIS FEET AND THEN GOOD-HUMORED PASSAGES OF WIT CREATED MUCH INTEREST AND ENTHUSIASM ALL REPORTS PLAINLY INDICATE THAT DOUGLAS WAS ASTONISHED AND DISCONCERTED AT THIS UNEXPECTED STRENGTH OF ARGUMENT AND THAT HE STRUGGLED VAINLY THROUGH A TWO HOURS REJOINDER TO BREAK THE FORCE OF LINCOLN'S VICTORY IN THE DEBATE
THE PROVISIONAL FREE-STATE LEGISLATURE HAD AFTER ORGANIZING ON THE 4TH OF MARCH ADJOURNED TO REASSEMBLE ON THE 4TH OF JULY 1856 IN ORDER TO AWAIT IN THE MEANTIME THE RESULT OF THEIR APPLICATION TO CONGRESS
LINCOLN'S SURVEYING INSTRUMENTS AND SADDLE-BAG
HENRY AT THE WISCONSIN BLUFFS AND THE BAD AXE BROKE AND DESTROYED FOREVER THE POWER OF BLACK HAWK AND THE BRITISH BAND OF SACS AND FOXES
PARTY ORGANIZATION WAS STRONG IN ILLINOIS AND FOR THE GREATER PART AS THE POPULAR DISCUSSION PROCEEDED THE DEMOCRATS SUSTAINED AND THE WHIGS OPPOSED THE NEW MEASURE
THE FIRST TWO SECTIONS PROHIBIT THE BRINGING OF SLAVES INTO THE DISTRICT OR SELLING THEM OUT OF IT PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT OFFICERS OF THE GOVERNMENT BEING CITIZENS OF SLAVE-HOLDING STATES MAY BRING THEIR HOUSEHOLD SERVANTS WITH THEM FOR A REASONABLE TIME AND TAKE THEM AWAY AGAIN
EXCITED OUTCRY FOLLOWED ANGRY REPARTEE
HERNDON HAD WRITTEN HIM A LETTER COMPLAINING THAT THE OLD MEN IN SANGAMON COUNTY WERE UNWILLING TO LET THE YOUNG ONES HAVE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES
THE LEATHER BREECHES TIED AROUND THE ANKLE REPLACED BY THE MODERN PANTALOONS
I AM IN FAVOR OF THE INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM AND OF A HIGH PROTECTIVE TARIFF
IT WOULD BE USELESS TO RECOUNT ALL THE TEDIOUS PRELIMINARIES OF THE AFFAIR
WE HAVE EVERY REQUISITE OF A GREAT EMPIRE THEY SAID EXCEPT ENTERPRISE AND INHABITANTS AND THEY THOUGHT THAT A LITTLE ENTERPRISE WOULD BRING THE INHABITANTS
WHEN HE CAME TO SPRINGFIELD THE DEMOCRATIC OFFICERS IN CHARGE REFUSED HIM THE USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF THE HOUSE A CIRCUMSTANCE HOWEVER WHICH ONLY SERVED TO DRAW HIM A LARGER AUDIENCE IN A NEIGHBORING GROVE
ALL SORTS OF WILD ANIMALS GREW SCARCE FROM THAT WINTER
EVERY OPPROBRIOUS EPITHET WILL BE APPLIED TO ME

MARCH 6 1833
AND THE ONLY TWO REMAINING FREE-STATE MEMBERS RESIGNED IN UTTER DISGUST TO AVOID GIVING COUNTENANCE TO THE FLAGRANT USURPATION BY THEIR PRESENCE
THE HOUSE OF GOVERNOR ROBINSON WAS ALSO ROBBED AND BURNED
I MADE THE DECLARATION THAT I WOULD NOT BE A CANDIDATE AGAIN MORE FROM A WISH TO DEAL FAIRLY WITH OTHERS TO KEEP PEACE AMONG OUR FRIENDS AND KEEP THE DISTRICT FROM GOING TO THE ENEMY THAN FOR ANY CAUSE PERSONAL TO MYSELF SO THAT IF IT SHOULD SO HAPPEN THAT NOBODY ELSE WISHES TO BE ELECTED I COULD NOT REFUSE THE PEOPLE THE RIGHT OF SENDING ME AGAIN
HE HOPES HE IS HAPPY WITH HIS WIFE BUT SHOULD I BE MISTAKEN IN THIS SHOULD EXCESSIVE PLEASURE STILL BE ACCOMPANIED WITH A PAINFUL COUNTERPART AT TIMES STILL LET ME URGE YOU AS I HAVE EVER DONE TO REMEMBER IN THE DEPTH AND EVEN AGONY OF DESPONDENCY THAT VERY SHORTLY YOU ARE TO FEEL WELL AGAIN FURTHER ON HE SAYS

THE PRESIDENT'S CORRESPONDENCE BOTH OFFICIAL AND PRIVATE PASSED THROUGH OUR HANDS
AND FINALLY THAT HE MIGHT COPY WHAT STRUCK HIM IN HIS READING AND THUS MAKE IT HIS OWN FOR FUTURE USE

THREE BROTHERS ARE MENTIONED WHO FELL OUT WITH US ABOUT EARLY AND ARE DOUBTFUL NOW
YOUNG AMERICA GAINED A NOMINAL TRIUMPH OLD FOGYDOM A REAL REVENGE AND THE SOUTH A SERVICEABLE NORTHERN ALLY
THE REAL FEAR AROSE FROM THE PALPABLE FACT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEAL THAT THE SLAVE SYSTEM WAS A REACTIONARY OBSTACLE IN THE PATHWAY OF MODERN CIVILIZATION AND ITS POLITICAL MATERIAL PHILOSOPHICAL AND RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENT
BUT I KNOW YOU WILL PARDON IT IN ME
AN INCIDENT IS RELATED TO SHOW HOW ACCURATELY LINCOLN COULD CALCULATE POLITICAL RESULTS IN ADVANCE--A FACULTY WHICH REMAINED WITH HIM ALL HIS LIFE
UPON THIS PROVOCATION SENATOR SUMNER OF MASSACHUSETTS THE NEXT DAY OFFERED ANOTHER AMENDMENT AFFIRMING THAT IT WAS NOT REPEALED BY THE BILL
VARIOUS CAUSES DELAYED THE EVENT BUT FINALLY ON FEBRUARY 8 1855 THE LEGISLATURE WENT INTO JOINT BALLOT
IF HE RECLINED AT THE FOOT OF A TREE ON A STILL SUMMER DAY IT WAS TO SLEEP
A GLANCE AT THE ADVERTISING COLUMNS OF THE NEWSPAPER WILL SHOW HOW MUCH ATTENTION TO DRESS WAS PAID IN THE NEW CAPITAL
THE SLEIGHT OF PLEA AND DEMURRER THE LEGERDEMAIN BY WHICH JUSTICE IS BALKED AND A WEAK CASE IS MADE TO GAIN AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE WAS TOO SUBTLE AND SHIFTY FOR HIS STRONG AND STRAIGHTFORWARD INTELLIGENCE
SOME OF HIS COMRADES REMEMBER STILL HIS BURSTS OF RIGHTEOUS WRATH WHEN A BOY AGAINST THE WANTON MURDER OF TURTLES AND OTHER CREATURES
THE TRUCE PATCHED UP BY THIS LAWRENCE TREATY WAS OF COMPARATIVELY SHORT DURATION
IF IT MUST LET IT
COME ON THEN GENTLEMEN OF THE SLAVE STATES SAID SEWARD IN A SENATE DISCUSSION
THE TERRITORIES OF NEW MEXICO AND UTAH WERE ORGANIZED LEAVING THE MEXICAN PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY IN FORCE
THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE EVER RECURRING MYSTIFICATION OF THE WITCH-HAZEL OR DIVINING-ROD
DELAHAY FOR REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 1828
BUT LIFE WAS NOT DARKENED BY THE CONSTANT MENACE OF MASSACRE
WHEN LINCOLN'S WIDOWHOOD HAD LASTED A YEAR HE WENT DOWN TO ELIZABETHTOWN TO BEGIN AGAIN THE WOOING BROKEN OFF SO MANY YEARS BEFORE
ANOTHER FAMILY CAME FROM KENTUCKY WITH A COTTON MANUFACTORY WHICH PROVED ITS ARISTOCRATIC CHARACTER BY NEVER DOING ANY WORK
HE VENTURES WITH A GENUINE TIMIDITY TO ASK A QUESTION WHICH WE MAY BELIEVE HAS NOT OFTEN BEEN ASKED BY ONE CIVILIZED MAN OF ANOTHER WITH THE HOPE OF A CANDID ANSWER SINCE MARRIAGES WERE CELEBRATED WITH RING AND BOOK
WILKINSON IN THE CENTURY MAGAZINE FOR JANUARY 1889 CHAPTER XIII THE CAMPAIGN OF 1844 IN THE LETTER TO STUART WHICH WE HAVE QUOTED LINCOLN ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION TO FORM A PARTNERSHIP WITH JUDGE LOGAN WHICH WAS SOON CARRIED OUT
HE IS HIMSELF A NORTHERN MAN OR RATHER A WESTERN FREE-STATE MAN WITH A CONSTITUENCY I BELIEVE TO BE AND WITH PERSONAL FEELINGS I KNOW TO BE AGAINST THE EXTENSION OF SLAVERY A DEFINITION IN WHICH HIS CAUTION AND HIS HONESTY ARE EQUALLY DISPLAYED AND HE HOPES GENERAL TAYLOR WOULD NOT IF ELECTED DO ANYTHING AGAINST ITS RESTRICTION
LINCOLN OF BIRDSBORO BERKS COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA TO THE WRITERS SAYS MY GRANDFATHER ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS MARRIED TO ANNA BOONE A FIRST COUSIN OF DANIEL BOONE JULY 10 1760 HE WAS HALF-BROTHER OF JOHN LINCOLN AND AFTERWARDS BECAME A MAN OF SOME PROMINENCE IN PENNSYLVANIA SERVING IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN 1789-90 AMONG THEM--BOTH BEING OF QUAKER LINEAGE
LOGAN IS MINE
BLUE MONDAY HAD COME AFTER THESE YEARS OF INTOXICATION AND A CRUSHING DEBT RESTED UPON A PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN DECEIVING THEMSELVES WITH THE FALLACY THAT IT WOULD SOMEHOW PAY ITSELF BY ACTS OF THE LEGISLATURE
FOR CASS 1,219,962
THEY WERE THE CHILDREN OF A RACE WHICH HAD BEEN TRAINED IN GOVERNMENT FOR CENTURIES IN THE BEST SCHOOL THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN AND WHEREVER THEY WENT THEY FORMED THE TOWN THE COUNTY THE COURT AND THE LEGISLATIVE POWER WITH THE EASE AND CERTAINTY OF NATURE EVOLVING ITS RESULTS
COPIED INTO NATIONAL ERA JAN
THEY WERE IN SUBSTANCE THE FOLLOWING
SO HAD THE JUDGES WHO APOLOGIZED TO THE CRIMINALS THAT THEY SENTENCED AND CHARGED THEM TO LET THEIR FRIENDS ON BEAR CREEK UNDERSTAND IT WAS THE LAW AND THE JURY WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE EVEN THE EASY FAMILIARITY OF A LATER DATE WOULD NO LONGER BE TOLERATED
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES HAS NO POWER UNDER THE CONSTITUTION TO INTERFERE WITH THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY IN THE DIFFERENT STATES
BUT SUCH WAS LINCOLN'S INFLUENCE UPON HIS ADHERENTS THAT AT HIS REQUEST THEY MADE THE SWEEPING SACRIFICE THOUGH WITH LINGERING SORROW
BUT THE VOLUNTEERS HAD THE FLEETER HORSES AND ONLY ELEVEN WERE OVERTAKEN
HE HAD AS WE HAVE SEEN FORMED A FAVORABLE OPINION OF THE YOUNG KENTUCKIAN THE FIRST TIME THEY HAD MET
LEGISLATIVE EXPERIENCE LINCOLN'S FIRST SESSION IN THE LEGISLATURE
TESTIMONY OF THE HON
THEY STRENUOUSLY DENIED HIS RIGHT TO QUESTION THE LEGALITY OF THE ELECTION AND THREATS AGAINST THE GOVERNOR'S LIFE IN CASE OF HIS REFUSAL TO ISSUE THEM BECAME ALARMINGLY FREQUENT
THEY MADE THE LONG JOURNEY BACK FIVE HUNDRED MILES IN PEACE AND SAFETY
SO FAR AS THE AUTHORIZED UTTERANCES OF THEIR CONVENTIONS WERE CONCERNED THERE WAS LITTLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM
HIS STANDING AS A SCIENTIFIC CITIZEN OF NEW SALEM WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO INSURE HIS SELECTION EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN KNOWN AS A BOLD NAVIGATOR
BUT THEY WERE SIMPLY THE UTTERANCES OF A YOUNG AND ARDENT WHIG EARNESTLY ADVOCATING THE ELECTION OF OLD TIPPECANOE AND NOT UNWILLING WHILE DOING THIS TO SHOW THE PEOPLE OF THE CAPITAL A SPECIMEN OF HIS ELOQUENCE
HE WAS FIFTY-SIX YEARS OLD
THE COMPROMISE MEASURES OF 1850
I HAD A SON JOHN WHO WAS RAISED WITH ABE
THIS PROCEEDING MAY END MY POLITICAL CAREER
559 THE JOURNAL DISCLOSES THAT RICHARDSON OF ILLINOIS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON TERRITORIES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON FEBRUARY 2 1853 INTRODUCED INTO THE HOUSE A BILL TO ORGANIZE THE TERRITORY OF NEBRASKA AFTER DUE REFERENCE AND SOME DESULTORY DEBATE ON THE 8TH IT WAS TAKEN UP AND PASSED BY THE HOUSE ON THE 10TH
AS YET LINCOLN HAD MADE BUT A SINGLE SPEECH THERE ON THE NEBRASKA QUESTION
IN KINDRED HEARTS THEIR MEMORY LIVE AND HISTORY GUARD THEIR FAME
SURELY THERE WAS ALL THE MORE EVIDENCE OF THE PATRIOTISM OF THE MAN WHO DOUBTING THE EXPEDIENCY AND EVEN THE ENTIRE JUSTICE OF THE WAR NEVERTHELESS SUPPORTED IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE WAR OF HIS COUNTRY
WITHOUT DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF THE PARTY OR ITS PURPOSES WE MAY INSIST THAT HIS ADOPTING THEM THUS OPENLY AT THE OUTSET OF HIS CAREER WAS AN EXTREMELY CHARACTERISTIC ACT AND MARKS THUS EARLY THE SCRUPULOUS CONSCIENTIOUSNESS WHICH SHAPED EVERY ACTION OF HIS LIFE
WHILE ACTING AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE I SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THEIR WILL ON ALL SUBJECTS UPON WHICH I HAVE THE MEANS OF KNOWING WHAT THEIR WILL IS AND UPON ALL OTHERS I SHALL DO WHAT MY OWN JUDGMENT TEACHES ME WILL BEST ADVANCE THEIR INTERESTS
THE OFFER WAS A FLATTERING ONE AND LINCOLN WITH THAT STEADY SELF-RELIANCE OF HIS ACCEPTED IT AND ARMED WITH HIS BOOK WENT OUT TO THE SCHOOLMASTER'S MENTON GRAHAM'S AND IN SIX WEEKS CLOSE APPLICATION MADE HIMSELF A SURVEYOR
THIS STATE OF THINGS HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE FANATICISM OF THE NORTH AND EAST WHILE UP TO THIS TIME THE PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH AND THOSE OF THE NORTH WHO DESIRE THE PERPETUATION OF THIS UNION AND ARE DEVOTED TO THE LAWS HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY CONSERVATIVE
1818 AGED 35 YEARS
HIS APPEARANCE DID NOT INVITE INSOLENCE
THEY WERE PROBABLY HELD IN ABEYANCE BY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
ON ACCOUNT OF HIS POLITICAL AVAILABILITY HE CONTINUED THROUGHOUT A LONG LIFETIME TO BE SELECTED AT INTERVALS FOR HIGH POSITIONS
HE LIVED A SOLITARY LIFE IN THE WOODS RETURNING FROM HIS LONESOME LITTLE GAMES TO HIS CHEERLESS HOME
THE PIONEERS BELIEVED IN IT FOR GOOD AND EVIL
HE BEGAN FOR THE FIRST TIME TO STUDY HIS CASES WITH ENERGY AND PATIENCE
ONE MAN RELATES THAT HE AND A FRIEND OR TWO WERE OUT IN A HUNTING PARTY WITH AN OX TEAM
NOT ONLY WERE THESE MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF GREAT ATTRACTIVENESS TO THE PUBLIC MIND BUT MANY POWERFUL SENTIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS REINFORCED THE CLAIM OF TEXAS
THE BORDER RUFFIANS MARCH ON LAWRENCE
HE HAS ALREADY MADE GREAT SACRIFICES IN MAINTAINING HIS PARTY PRINCIPLES AND BEFORE HIS POLITICAL FRIENDS ASK HIM TO MAKE ADDITIONAL SACRIFICES THE SUBJECT SHOULD BE WELL CONSIDERED
THEY WERE TO BECOME GOVERNORS SENATORS AND JUDGES
NEARLY IF NOT QUITE ALL THE FREE-STATE LEADERS ORIGINALLY WENT TO KANSAS AS FRIENDS OF PRESIDENT PIERCE AND AS BELIEVERS IN THE DOGMA OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY NOW THAT THIS USURPING LEGISLATURE HAD MET CONTEMPTUOUSLY EXPELLED THE FREE-STATE MEMBERS DEFIED THE GOVERNOR'S VETO SET UP ITS INGENIOUSLY CONTRIVED LEGAL DESPOTISM AND COMMISSIONED ITS PARTISAN FOLLOWERS TO EXECUTE AND ADMINISTER IT THE SITUATION BECAME SUFFICIENTLY GRAVE TO DEMAND DEFENSIVE ACTION
I AM TO ADDRESS THE POPE SURROUNDED BY ANGELS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY APOSTLES IN BEHALF OF THE PROPHET OF THE LORD WE ONCE HEARD LINCOLN SAY OF BUTTERFIELD THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW WHIGS IN ILLINOIS WHO APPROVED THE MEXICAN WAR
GOVERNOR REEDER HAD FEARED A REPETITION OF THE NOVEMBER FRAUDS
THERE IS STILL LIVING 1886 NEAR KNOB CREEK IN KENTUCKY AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY A MAN WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE KNOWN ABRAHAM LINCOLN IN HIS CHILDHOOD--AUSTIN GOLLAHER
SHE OFFERED US A MAGNIFICENT ESTATE OF 376,000 SQUARE MILES OF TERRITORY ALL OF IT VALUABLE AND MUCH OF IT OF UNSURPASSED RICHNESS AND FERTILITY
EVEN THOSE PORTIONS OF IT ONCE CONDEMNED AS DESERT NOW CONTRIBUTE TO THE MARKETS OF THE WORLD VAST STORES OF WOOL AND COTTON HERDS OF CATTLE AND FLOCKS OF SHEEP
THE WHIGS WERE TAKEN COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE AND IN A REMARKABLY SMALL TOTAL VOTE MCDANIELS DEMOCRAT WAS CHOSEN BY ABOUT SIXTY MAJORITY
THOSE WHO PREACH PEACE SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST TO COMMENCE AND REOPEN AN OLD QUARREL IN HIS SENATE SPEECHES DURING THE COMPROMISE DEBATES OF 1850 WHILE GENERALLY ADVOCATING HIS THEORY OF NON-INTERVENTION HE HAD SOUNDED THE WHOLE GAMUT OF THE SLAVERY DISCUSSION DEFENDING THE VARIOUS MEASURES OF ADJUSTMENT AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF THE SOUTHERN EXTREMISTS AND SPECIFICALLY DEFENDING THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE
IN THIS WAY IT RECEIVED AS WE EXPECTED THE INTELLIGENT CRITICISM OF A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF READERS THOROUGHLY INFORMED IN REGARD TO THE EVENTS NARRATED AND WE HAVE DERIVED THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE FROM THE SUGGESTIONS AND CORRECTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ELICITED DURING THE SERIAL PUBLICATION WHICH BEGAN IN NOVEMBER 1886 AND CLOSED EARLY IN 1890

FEW OF HIS FORENSIC SPEECHES HAVE BEEN PRESERVED BUT HIS CONTEMPORARIES ALL AGREE AS TO THEIR SINGULAR ABILITY AND POWER
THE PARTY WAS WITHOUT A NATIONAL LEADER
SINCE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S RETURN TO SPRINGFIELD FROM HIS SINGLE TERM OF SERVICE IN CONGRESS 1847 TO 1849 THOUGH BY NO MEANS ENTIRELY WITHDRAWN FROM POLITICS HIS CAMPAIGNING HAD BEEN GREATLY DIMINISHED
AMONG HIS MEASURES WAS ONE FOR THE PROTECTION OF GAME
AFTERWARDS SENATOR FROM OREGON AND AS COLONEL OF THE 71ST PENNSYLVANIA CALLED THE 1ST CALIFORNIA KILLED AT BALL'S BLUFF AND SOME OTHERS WHO PROTESTED AGAINST THE ACT BECAUSE 1ST
THE GOVERNOR VETOED THE BILL BUT IT WAS AT ONCE PASSED OVER HIS VETO
A PUBLIC MEETING WAS HELD IN SPRINGFIELD ON THE 29TH OF MAY AT WHICH MR LINCOLN DELIVERED WHAT WAS CONSIDERED A THRILLING AND EFFECTIVE SPEECH ON THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS AND THE DUTY OF CITIZENS TO STAND BY THE FLAG OF THE NATION UNTIL AN HONORABLE PEACE WAS SECURED
THE CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS
LINDER ANSWERED HIM WANTING TO KNOW IF IT WOULD NOT BE AS EASY TO ELECT TAYLOR WITHOUT OPPOSING THE WAR WHICH DREW FROM LINCOLN THE ANGRY RESPONSE THAT SILENCE WAS IMPOSSIBLE

THE FAMILIES HAD FOR A CENTURY BEEN CLOSELY ALLIED
TOOK IT UP HIMSELF REPLIED MR GREEN AS HE DID A HUNDRED THINGS AND MASTERED IT TOO
TO SHOW HOW CRUDE AND VAGUE WERE THE IDEAS OF EVEN THE MOST INTELLIGENT MEN IN RELATION TO THIS GREAT EMPIRE WE GIVE A FEW LINES FROM THE CLOSING PAGE OF EDWARD D MANSFIELD'S HISTORY OF THE MEXICAN WAR PUBLISHED IN 1849
WE SHALL NOW TRY TO SKETCH THE BEGINNINGS OF THAT TREMENDOUS CONTROVERSY WHICH HE WAS IN A FEW YEARS TO TAKE UP TO GUIDE AND DIRECT TO ITS WONDERFUL AND TRAGICAL CLOSE
HIS TEMPTATION DID NOT END EVEN WITH BUTTERFIELD'S SUCCESS
MORALISTS CALLED IT AN INEXCUSABLE NATIONAL CRIME CONCEIVED BY SOUTHERN STATESMEN FOR THE BENEFIT OF SLAVERY FOOTNOTE
BAKER TOOK PART
AN UNFAILING VEIN OF HUMOR NEVER DESERTED HIM
THIS COURSE OF DISSIPATION DID NOT CONTINUE LONG AS HE WAS CONVERTED AND UNITED WITH THE EBENEZER METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN JUNE OF THAT YEAR WHEN ONLY SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AND IMMEDIATELY DEVELOPED SUCH ZEAL AND POWER IN EXHORTATION THAT LESS THAN A YEAR LATER HE WAS LICENSED TO EXERCISE HIS GIFTS AS AN EXHORTER SO LONG AS HIS PRACTICE IS AGREEABLE TO THE GOSPEL HE BECAME A DEACON AT TWENTY-ONE AN ELDER AT TWENTY-THREE A PRESIDING ELDER AT TWENTY-SEVEN AND FROM THAT TIME HIS LIFE IS THE HISTORY OF HIS CHURCH IN THE WEST FOR SIXTY YEARS

A LETTER FROM DAVID J
LITTLE BY LITTLE BUT STEADILY AS MAN'S MARCH TO THE GRAVE WE HAVE BEEN GIVING UP THE OLD FOR THE NEW FAITH
THE STORY OF CHAPULTEPEC HAS THE SAME ELEMENT OF THE MARVELOUS IN IT
HIS NATIVE TACT AND HUMOR WERE INVALUABLE IN HIS WORK AS A PEACEMAKER AND HIS ENORMOUS PHYSICAL STRENGTH WHICH HE ALWAYS USED WITH A MAGNANIMITY RARE AMONG GIANTS PLACED HIS OFF-HAND DECREES BEYOND THE REACH OF CONTEMPTUOUS QUESTION
HE WAS KNOWN TO BE CAPABLE OF HANDLING ALMOST ANY MAN HE MET YET HE NEVER SOUGHT A QUARREL
THIS MOVEMENT EXCITED GENERAL ALARM IN THE STATE
WHEN YOUNG BACHELORS CAME FROM KENTUCKY ON TRIPS OF BUSINESS OR PLEASURE THEY DAZZLED THE EYES OF THE WOMEN AND EXCITED THE ENVY OF THEIR MALE RIVALS WITH THEIR BLACK RETAINERS
I COULD WISH HE SAID THAT IT HAD BEEN THE FORTUNE OF THE GALLANT DAVIS FOOTNOTE
REYNOLDS LIFE AND TIMES HE ENTERED POLITICAL LIFE IN ONE OF THOSE ERAS OF DELUSIVE PROSPERITY WHICH SO OFTEN PRECEDE GREAT FINANCIAL CONVULSIONS
WHEREVER THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL IT GAVE IMMEDIATE AND AVAILABLE MAJORITIES TO THE OPPOSITION WHICH MADE THEIR INFLUENCE FELT EVEN IN THE VERY OPENING OF THE POPULAR CONTEST FOLLOWING THE CONGRESSIONAL REPEAL
MR SPEED WAS A KENTUCKIAN CARRYING ON A GENERAL MERCANTILE BUSINESS IN SPRINGFIELD--A BROTHER OF THE DISTINGUISHED LAWYER JAMES SPEED OF LOUISVILLE WHO AFTERWARDS BECAME ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES
YOU MAY REMEMBER AS I WELL DO THAT FROM LOUISVILLE TO THE MOUTH OF THE OHIO THERE WERE ON BOARD TEN OR A DOZEN SLAVES SHACKLED TOGETHER WITH IRONS
FROM THIS AROSE A SINGULAR PREJUDICE AGAINST NEW ENGLAND PEOPLE

THIS DETERMINATION WAS ECHOED AND REECHOED AFFIRMED AND REAFFIRMED BY THE RECOGNIZED ORGANS OF THE PUBLIC VOICE--FROM THE VILLAGE NEWSPAPER TO THE PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE FROM THE COUNTRY DEBATING SCHOOL TO THE MEASURED UTTERANCES OF SENATORIAL DISCUSSION
IT MAY BE SAID GENERALLY THAT THE CHARACTER OF THIS PEOPLE WAS FAR ABOVE THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES
THE IRREGULAR BORDER-RUFFIAN SQUADS WERE HASTILY INCORPORATED INTO THE SKELETON KANSAS MILITIA THE POSSE BECAME SOME TWO THOUSAND STRONG AND THE DEFENDERS OF LAWRENCE PERHAPS ONE THOUSAND
WHATEVER FAULTS OF TASTE OR OF METHOD MAY BE FOUND IN IT CONSIDERING IT AS A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WITH NO MORE PROPRIETY OR PERTINENCE THAN HUNDREDS OF OTHERS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS AN EXTREMELY ABLE SPEECH AND IT IS BY ITSELF ENOUGH TO SHOW HOW REMARKABLY EFFECTIVE HE MUST HAVE BEEN AS A CANVASSER IN THE REMOTER DISTRICTS OF HIS STATE WHERE MEANS OF INTELLECTUAL EXCITEMENT WERE RARE AND A POLITICAL MEETING WAS THE BEST-KNOWN FORM OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT

BOTH THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE BALANCE OF POWER IN NATIONAL LEGISLATION AS RESULTING FROM SLAVES ALREADY IN AND HEREAFTER TO BE IMPORTED INTO OLD AND NEW STATES WERE DEBATED UNDER VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES AND PROBABILITIES
MR COOK WHO SO LONG REPRESENTED THE STATE IN CONGRESS USED TO RELATE WITH MUCH AMUSEMENT HOW HE ONCE SPENT THE NIGHT IN A FARMER'S CABIN AND LISTENED TO THE HONEST MAN'S DENUNCIATIONS OF THAT YANKEE COOK COOK WAS A KENTUCKIAN BUT HIS ENEMIES COULD THINK OF NO MORE DREADFUL STIGMA TO APPLY TO HIM THAN THAT OF CALLING HIM A YANKEE

THIS WAS A PLACE MORE SUITED TO HIM THAN THE OTHER AND HIS ACCEPTANCE OF IT WAS URGED BY SOME OF HIS MOST JUDICIOUS FRIENDS FOOTNOTE
EVERY SETTLER OF COURSE WANTED HIS FARM SURVEYED AND MARKED OUT FOR HIM AND EVERY COMMUNITY HAD ITS SYNDICATE OF LEADING CITIZENS WHO CHERISHED A SCHEME OF LAYING OUT A CITY SOMEWHERE
AT A MEETING HELD IN SPRINGFIELD JUNE 12 HE INTRODUCED AND SUPPORTED RESOLUTIONS DECLARING THAT THE GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE AS FOUND IN OUR CONSTITUTION IS MOST SACRED AND INVIOLABLE AND ONE THAT BELONGS NO LESS TO THE CATHOLIC THAN THE PROTESTANT AND THAT ALL ATTEMPTS TO ABRIDGE OR INTERFERE WITH THESE RIGHTS EITHER OF CATHOLIC OR PROTESTANT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY HAVE OUR DECIDED DISAPPROBATION AND SHALL HAVE OUR MOST EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION SEVERAL TIMES AFTERWARDS IN HIS LIFE LINCOLN WAS FORCED TO CONFRONT THIS SAME PROSCRIPTIVE SPIRIT AMONG THE MEN WITH WHOM HE WAS MORE OR LESS AFFILIATED POLITICALLY AND HE NEVER FAILED TO DENOUNCE IT AS IT DESERVED WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE RISK OF LOSS INVOLVED
THE RESULT WAS A DECISIVE DEFEAT FOR THE SLAVE PARTY
BUT AS THE MORNING OF THE 4TH OF MARCH WAS BREAKING AN UNWILLING SENATE LAID THE BILL ON THE TABLE BY A VOTE OF TWENTY-THREE TO SEVENTEEN HERE AS IN THE HOUSE THE WEST BEING FOR AND THE SOUTH AGAINST THE MEASURE
THE ROLL-CALL OF THE TENTH BALLOT STILL SHOWED 15 VOTES FOR LINCOLN 36 FOR TRUMBULL 47 FOR MATTESON
WHEN THE TIME ARRIVED FOR THE ASSEMBLING OF THE LEGISLATURE THE MEMBERS WERE NOT LEFT TO THEIR OWN ZEAL AND THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR CAMPAIGN PLEDGES BUT MEETINGS AND CONVENTIONS WERE EVERYWHERE HELD TO SPUR THEM UP TO THE FULFILLMENT OF THEIR MANDATE
WHAT THAT DEFECT IS I THINK I KNOW
YOU HAD OBVIOUSLY IMPROVED AT THE VERY TIME I HAD SO MUCH FANCIED YOU WOULD HAVE GROWN WORSE
HE HAD NO SUCH VALUABLE WEDDING GIFT TO BESTOW UPON HER
THEY WERE REFERRED TO A COMMITTEE WHO IN DUE TIME REPORTED A SET OF RESOLVES HIGHLY DISAPPROVING ABOLITION SOCIETIES
DOUGLAS WAS APPREHENSIVE THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD WITHDRAW OR WITHHOLD FROM HIM A FULL AND UNDIVIDED ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT AND TOLD MR HAMLIN THAT HE INTENDED TO GET FROM HIM SOMETHING IN BLACK AND WHITE WHICH WOULD HOLD HIM
HALF A CENTURY OF EXPERIMENT AND INVENTION IN ENGLAND HAD BROUGHT ABOUT THE CONCURRENT IMPROVEMENT OF MACHINERY FOR SPINNING AND WEAVING AND OF THE HIGH-PRESSURE ENGINE TO FURNISH MOTIVE POWER
HE DID NOT HOWL IN VAIN FOR THE PLACABLE GIANT WHEN HIS DISCIPLINE WAS FINISHED BROUGHT WATER TO BATHE THE CULPRIT'S SMARTING FACE AND DOUBTLESS IMPROVED THE OCCASION WITH QUAINT ADMONITION
IT WAS GROWING LATE IN THE AUTUMN AND THE PIONEER PROBABLY DREADED ANOTHER LONELY WINTER ON PIGEON CREEK

IT WAS MY HAPPINESS TO BE DESTITUTE OF THIS AFFLICTING PASSION WITH WHICH I HAD THE GREATEST REASON TO BE AFFLICTED AFTER HIS BROTHER'S RETURN FOR A YEAR LONGER THEY HUNTED IN THOSE LOVELY WILDS AND THEN RETURNED TO THE YADKIN TO BRING THEIR FAMILIES TO THE NEW DOMAIN

THE OCCASION WAS NOT LONG IN PRESENTING ITSELF
MRS JOHNSTON WAS NOT ALTOGETHER PORTIONLESS

THE NATIONAL PLATFORMS ON THE SLAVERY ISSUE
IT WAS TO SUCH A POPULATION AND UNDER SUCH A CONDITION OF THINGS THAT SENATOR ATCHISON WENT TO HIS HOME IN PLATTE COUNTY IN THE SUMMER OF 1854 TO PREACH HIS PRO-SLAVERY CRUSADE AGAINST KANSAS
IN 1827 THE LEGISLATURE ELECTED A STATE TREASURER AFTER AN EXCITING CONTEST AND BEFORE THE MEMBERS HAD LEFT THE HOUSE THE UNSUCCESSFUL ASPIRANT CAME IN AND SOUNDLY THRASHED ONE AFTER THE OTHER FOUR OF THE REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAD VOTED AGAINST HIM
IN THE SPRING OF THE NEXT YEAR FINDING THAT THEIR MERCHANDISE WAS GAINING THEM LITTLE OR NOTHING THEY CONCLUDED TO KEEP A TAVERN IN ADDITION TO THEIR OTHER BUSINESS AND THE RECORDS OF THE COUNTY COURT OF SANGAMON COUNTY SHOW THAT BERRY TOOK OUT A LICENSE FOR THAT PURPOSE ON THE 6TH OF MARCH 1833
AN ANTI-NEBRASKA LEGISLATURE ELECTED
EVEN IN HIS LIFETIME THE SIMPLE STORY OF HIS LIFE BECAME SO OVERGROWN WITH A NET-WORK OF FABLE THAT THERE IS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE SIMPLE COURAGEOUS PREJUDICED ITINERANT OF HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND THE FIGHTING BRAWLING HALF-CIVILIZED PROTESTANT FRIAR TUCK OF BAR-ROOM NEWSPAPER LEGEND
BY THE WILL OF MORDECAI LINCOLN TO WHICH REFERENCE HAS BEEN MADE HIS LOVING FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR GEORGE BOONE WAS MADE A TRUSTEE TO ASSIST HIS WIDOW IN THE CARE OF THE PROPERTY
AMONG THOSE WHO ENLISTED AT THE FIRST TAP OF THE DRUM WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND EQUALLY TO HIS SURPRISE AND DELIGHT HE WAS ELECTED CAPTAIN OF HIS COMPANY
HE ALSO SAID THAT ABE COULD BEAT ANY MAN IN THE COUNTY RUNNING JUMPING OR WRASTLING THIS PROPOSITION BEING LESS ABSTRACT IN ITS NATURE WAS MORE READILY GRASPED BY THE LOCAL MIND AND WAS NOT LIKELY TO PASS UNCHALLENGED
THE UNCONDITIONAL CLAY MEN RALLIED ONCE MORE AND GAVE THEIR AGED LEADER 97 VOTES TO 111 WHICH TAYLOR RECEIVED ON THE FIRST BALLOT
EVERY TOWN HAD ITS ONE OR TWO ABOLITIONISTS WHO WERE REGARDED AS HARMLESS OR DANGEROUS LUNATICS ACCORDING TO THE ENERGY WITH WHICH THEY MADE THEIR VIEWS KNOWN
BUT THIS MASTERLY SPEECH COVERED THE WHOLE GROUND OF THE CONTROVERSY AND SO INTENT WAS LINCOLN ON NOT EXCEEDING HIS HOUR THAT HE FINISHED HIS TASK TO HIS OWN SURPRISE IN FORTY-FIVE MINUTES
IF HE REFUSED TO RESIGN SUCH REFUSAL MIGHT CARRY SOME MEMBER TO THE DEMOCRATS

THEY WERE SPARED THE HEROIC STRUGGLE OF THE ADVANCE-GUARD OF CIVILIZATION IN OTHER STATES
AND WITH THIS FEELING IN HIS HEART HE DESIRED TO BE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON TERRITORIES WHEN A BILL WAS INTRODUCED
BUT THE USUAL RESULT FOLLOWED AS SOON AS IT WAS FORMALLY INTRODUCED TO THE NOTICE OF CONGRESS IT WAS MET BY THAT VIOLENT AND EXCITED OPPOSITION WHICH GREETED ANY MEASURE HOWEVER INTRINSICALLY MODERATE AND REASONABLE WHICH WAS FOUNDED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT SLAVERY WAS NOT IN ITSELF A GOOD AND DESIRABLE THING

SEVERAL MEMBERS OPPOSED IT BECAUSE THE INDIAN TITLE TO THE LANDS WAS NOT YET EXTINGUISHED AND BECAUSE IT EMBRACED RESERVATIONS PLEDGED TO INDIAN OCCUPANCY IN PERPETUITY
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS OWNED BY A SET OF OLD CLOTHES-HORSES
BUT I HAD ALSO SUPPOSED THAT THE EXTENT TO WHICH I FEEL AUTHORIZED TO CARRY THAT OPPOSITION PRACTICALLY WAS NOT AT ALL SATISFACTORY TO THAT PARTY
AT LAST FEELING THAT HIS HONOR AND DUTY WERE INVOLVED HE MADE A DIRECT PROPOSAL TO HER AND RECEIVED AN EQUALLY DIRECT KIND AND COURTEOUS REFUSAL
WE THE UNDERSIGNED BEING APPOINTED TO VIEW AND LOCATE A WHOLE LENGTH OF ROAD 26 ROAD BEGINNING AT MUSICK'S FERRY ON SALT CREEK VIA NEW SALEM TO THE COUNTY LINE IN THE DIRECTION TO JACKSONVILLE RESPECTFULLY REPORT THAT WE HAVE PERFORMED THE DUTIES OF SAID VIEW AND LOCATION AS REQUIRED BY LAW AND THAT WE HAVE MADE THE LOCATION ON GOOD GROUND AND BELIEVE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SAME TO BE NECESSARY AND PROPER
BUT ABOUT THE TIME OF WHICH WE ARE SPEAKING THE SPIRIT OF EMIGRATION HAD REACHED THE LOWER STRATA OF COLONIAL SOCIETY AND A STEADY STREAM OF PIONEERS BEGAN POURING OVER THE PASSES OF THE MOUNTAINS INTO THE GREEN AND FERTILE VALLEYS OF KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE
MERRYMAN NOT BEING AN OFFICE-HOLDER AND HAVING NO SALARY TO RISK RESPONDED WITH BRUTAL DIRECTNESS WHICH WAS HIGHLY UNSATISFACTORY TO WHITESIDES WHO WAS DETERMINED NOT TO FIGHT UNLESS HE COULD DO SO LAWFULLY
I ACCEDED TO THE PROPOSITION AT ONCE WHEREUPON A MOST INTERESTING INTERCHANGE OCCURRED BETWEEN US
FIRST THAT A MAJORITY OF THE COURT WOULD CERTAINLY DECIDE AGAINST THE ALIENS
PIONEER LIFE
HERE THE INGENIOUS LINCOLN EMPLOYED HIS HEREDITARY TALENT FOR CARPENTRY BY MAKING AN OAR FOR THE FRAIL VESSEL WHILE HARRISON WAS PROVIDING THE COMMISSARY STORES
A SOPHISTICATED READER MAY SMILE AT THE MENTION OF ANYTHING LIKE SOCIAL ETHICS IN VANDALIA IN 1834
BUT PUBLIC OPINION IN THAT PART OF THE UNION WAS FEARFULLY TYRANNICAL AND INTOLERANT
IN AUGUST STUART WAS REFLECTED TO CONGRESS
LINCOLN REELECTED
HALF YOU WILL GET FOR THE LAND YOU WILL SPEND IN MOVING TO MISSOURI AND THE OTHER HALF YOU WILL EAT AND DRINK AND WEAR OUT AND NO FOOT OF LAND WILL BE BOUGHT
IT LABORED SPECIALLY TO BRING ABOUT THE DISSOLUTION OF THE OLD PARTY ORGANIZATIONS AND THE FORMATION OF A NEW ONE BASED UPON THE GENERAL POLICY OF RESISTING THE EXTENSION OF SLAVERY
HE ALWAYS TRIED A CASE FAIRLY AND HONESTLY
ALTHOUGH A GREAT ATHLETE AND A TIRELESS WARRIOR HE HATED FIGHTING AND ONLY FOUGHT FOR PEACE
THIS INTELLIGENCE REACHED VANDALIA ON THE EVENING OF THE 26TH OF DECEMBER AND IN THE MORNING NINE CANDIDATES APPEARED IN THAT PLACE AND IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT A NUMBER MORE WOULD SOON BE IN AMONG THEM THE LION OF THE NORTH WHO IT IS THOUGHT WILL CLAIM THE OFFICE BY PREEMPTION FOOTNOTE
THE WHOLE FAMILY CONNECTION WAS COMPOSED OF PEOPLE SO LITTLE GIVEN TO LETTERS THAT IT IS HARD TO DETERMINE THE PROPER NAMES AND RELATIONSHIPS OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS AMID THE TANGLE OF TRADITIONAL COUSINSHIPS
IF ALL THE VOTES CAST FOR JAMES G
UPSHUR FIRST BEGAN HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH TEXAS THE MEXICAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AT HIS EARLIEST RUMORS OF WHAT WAS AFOOT ADDRESSED A NOTE TO WADDY THOMPSON OUR MINISTER IN MEXICO REFERRING TO THE REPORTED INTENTION OF TEXAS TO SEEK ADMISSION TO THE UNION AND FORMALLY PROTESTING AGAINST IT AS AN AGGRESSION UNPRECEDENTED IN THE ANNALS OF THE WORLD AND ADDING IF IT BE INDISPENSABLE FOR THE MEXICAN NATION TO SEEK SECURITY FOR ITS RIGHTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE DISASTERS OF WAR IT WILL CALL UPON GOD AND RELY ON ITS OWN EFFORTS FOR THE DEFENSE OF ITS JUST CAUSE A LITTLE WHILE LATER GENERAL ALMONTE RENEWED THIS NOTIFICATION AT WASHINGTON SAYING IN SO MANY WORDS THAT THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS WOULD TERMINATE HIS MISSION AND THAT MEXICO WOULD DECLARE WAR AS SOON AS IT RECEIVED INTIMATION OF SUCH AN ACT
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS STUPENDOUS SCHEME THE LEGISLATURE VOTED EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO BE RAISED BY LOAN
WHERE THEY BEAR SEVERELY UPON STATESMEN AND GENERALS WHOM WE HAVE LOVED AND HONORED WE HAVE NOT SCRUPLED TO SET THEM FORTH AT THE RISK OF BEING ACCUSED OF COLDNESS AND INGRATITUDE TO THOSE WITH WHOM WE HAVE LIVED ON TERMS OF INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP
44 THEY WERE FULL OF STRANGE SUPERSTITIONS
THE OFFICIAL ACTION OF THE SENATE APPEARS TO HAVE CONCERNED ITSELF EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE COPY PRESENTED BY GENERAL CASS ON MARCH 24
AND AGAIN MORE OPEN THREATS AND MORE OMINOUS MOVEMENTS TOWARDS DISUNION CAME FROM THE SOUTH
THERE WERE EVEN AT THAT EARLY DAY LAWYERS AND NOT A FEW WHO HAD ALREADY WON REPUTATION IN THE OLDER STATES AND WHOSE NAMES ARE STILL HONORED IN THE PROFESSION
I EXPECT TO MAKE ONE WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO IN WHICH I HOPE TO SUCCEED WELL ENOUGH TO WISH YOU TO SEE IT HE EVIDENTLY HAD THE ORATOR'S TEMPERAMENT--THE MIXTURE OF DREAD AND EAGERNESS WHICH ALL GOOD SPEAKERS FEEL BEFORE FACING AN AUDIENCE WHICH MADE CICERO TREMBLE AND TURN PALE WHEN RISING IN THE FORUM
152 ET SEQ A FEW DAYS AFTER THE LAW-AND-ORDER MEETING IN LEAVENWORTH THERE OCCURRED A MURDER IN A SMALL SETTLEMENT THIRTEEN MILES WEST OF THE TOWN OF LAWRENCE
IF HE IS NOT A MAN IN THAT CASE HE WHO IS A MAN MAY AS A MATTER OF SELF-GOVERNMENT DO JUST WHAT HE PLEASES WITH HIM
ITS RELATIONS WITH MEXICO WHILE THEY WERE NO MORE FRIENDLY HAD CEASED TO EXCITE ALARM
FAITHFUL TO THEIR LEGISLATIVE DECLARATION THEY KNEW BUT ONE ISSUE SLAVERY
CONTEMPORARY OBSERVERS DIFFER AS TO THE CAUSES WHICH GRADUALLY AS THE SUMMER ADVANCED CHANGED THE COURSE OF PUBLIC OPINION TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO BRING DEFEAT IN NOVEMBER UPON A PARTY WHICH WAS SO SURE OF VICTORY IN JUNE
AND IN GENERAL ABRAHAM WAS EXPOSED THROUGH ALL THE EARLIER PART OF HIS LIFE TO THOSE MALARIAL INFLUENCES WHICH MADE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS CENTURY THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS OF PERUVIAN BARK A PART OF THE DAILY FOOD OF THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA AND ILLINOIS
SURVEYOR'S CERTIFICATE SLIGHTLY REDUCED TAKEN FROM RECORD BOOK B PAGE 60 IN THE OFFICE OF JEFFERSON COUNTY KENTUCKY THE BARBAROUS NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE SAVAGE INTERCOURSE UNDOUBTEDLY HAD THEIR EFFECT UPON THE MANNERS AND MORALS OF THE SETTLERS
MEN CARRYING BAGS OF SILVER FROM THE TOWNS OF ILLINOIS TO ST LOUIS RATHER MADE A DISPLAY OF IT AS IT ENHANCED THEIR OWN IMPORTANCE AND THERE WAS NO FEAR OF ROBBERY
COLONEL E
IN FACT WE LET HER FLOAT ALL NIGHT AND ON THE NEXT MORNING ALWAYS FOUND THE OBJECTS STILL VISIBLE THAT WERE BESIDE US THE PREVIOUS EVENING
AT THE NINE DAYS SIEGE OF BOONESBORO HE TOOK DELIBERATE AIM AND KILLED A NEGRO RENEGADE WHO WAS HARASSING THE GARRISON FROM A TREE FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE FEET AWAY AND WHOSE HEAD ONLY WAS VISIBLE FROM THE FORT
THE WHIGS IN THE WAR
116 HAVING HAD THEIR HORSES STOLEN THE DAY BEFORE BY SOME PATRIOT OVER-ANXIOUS TO REACH HOME
194 THEY HAD THEIR OWN AMUSEMENTS OF COURSE
IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT THIS ACT OF COMMON HUMANITY WAS REGARDED AS SOMETHING REMARKABLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
HE SUPPORTED HIS BILL IN A PERFECTLY CHARACTERISTIC SPEECH MAKING NO EFFORT TO EVADE HIS SHARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CRISIS AND SUBMITTING HIS VIEWS WITH DIFFIDENCE TO THE APPROVAL OF THE ASSEMBLY
HE WAS NOT BEHIND THE GREATER PART OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS RESPECT
NOTHING WAS LEFT OF THE BRILLIANT SCHEMES OF THE HISTORIC LEGISLATURE OF 1836 BUT A LOAD OF DEBT WHICH CRIPPLED FOR MANY YEARS THE ENERGIES OF THE PEOPLE A FEW MILES OF EMBANKMENTS WHICH THE GRASS HASTENED TO COVER AND A FEW ABUTMENTS WHICH STOOD FOR YEARS BY THE SIDES OF LEAFY RIVERS WAITING FOR THEIR LONG DELAYING BRIDGES AND TRAINS
MEMORIAL SENATE EX
MEMORIAL SENATE EX
MEMORIAL SENATE EX
HIS WIDER KNOWLEDGE OF MEN AND THINGS ACQUIRED BY CONTACT WITH THE GREAT WORLD HAD SHOWN HIM A CERTAIN LACK IN HIMSELF OF THE POWER OF CLOSE AND SUSTAINED REASONING
HIS GARB HIS FURS WERE OF THE FASHION OF QUEBEC
THE POLITICIAN'S HABIT OF GLORIFYING THE PETTY INCIDENTS OF A CANDIDATE'S LIFE ALWAYS SEEMED ABSURD TO HIM AND IN HIS SPEECH MADE IN 1848 RIDICULING THE EFFORT ON THE PART OF GENERAL CASS'S FRIENDS TO DRAW SOME POLITICAL ADVANTAGE FROM THAT GENTLEMAN'S RESPECTABLE BUT OBSCURE SERVICES ON THE FRONTIER IN THE WAR WITH GREAT BRITAIN HE STOPPED ANY FUTURE EULOGIST FROM PAINTING HIS OWN MILITARY ACHIEVEMENTS IN TOO LIVELY COLORS
542-544 SIDENOTE
THE WHOLE MATTER FORGOTTEN
HE SUPPORTED IT WITH ENERGY AND CORDIALITY
OF THESE SPRINGFIELD WAS ONLY THIRD IN POPULAR ESTIMATION AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MR LINCOLN HAD NEED OF ALL HIS WITS IF HE WERE TO FULFILL THE TRUST CONFIDED TO HIM
YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN KIND TO ME AND I DO NOT MEAN TO BE UNKIND TO YOU
MR LINCOLN TOOK LITTLE PART IN THE DISCUSSIONS INCIDENT TO THESE PROCEEDINGS
THE COURAGEOUS PIONEERS PRESSED FORWARD ALL THE MORE EARNESTLY AND TO SUCH PURPOSE THAT IN LESS THAN TWENTY-FIVE YEARS THE PACIFIC RAILROAD FOLLOWED FREMONT'S FIRST EXPLORATION THROUGH THE SOUTH PASS
CLAY NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT
THE MASTER NOT ONLY GOVERNS THE SLAVE WITHOUT HIS CONSENT BUT HE GOVERNS HIM BY A SET OF RULES ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHICH HE PRESCRIBES FOR HIMSELF
1113 PREFACING HIS REMARKS WITH THE STATEMENT THAT HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE HE CONTINUED
NEW SALEM/JUNE 13 1836
THE SENATE HAD THE REQUISITE PRO-SLAVERY MAJORITY OF TWO-THIRDS FOR A CONVENTION
SUCH MEN AS GOVERNOR NINIAN EDWARDS WHO CAME WITH THE PRESTIGE OF A DISTINGUISHED FAMILY CONNECTION A LARGE FORTUNE A GOOD EDUCATION AND A DISTINCTION OF MANNERS AND OF DRESS--RUFFLES GOLD BUTTONS AND FAIR-TOPPED BOOTS--WHICH WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN PARDONED A FEW YEARS LATER
HIS FINAL MOVE WAS TO GOOSE NEST PRAIRIE WHERE HE DIED IN 1851 FOOTNOTE
THE FULL PERSONAL DETAILS OF THIS EVENT ARE LOST TO HISTORY
THE PROCESS OF REASONING OR RATHER PREDICTING WAS EASY AND NATURAL
A STATE OF SOCIETY WHERE ONE COULD AT THAT AGE CALL HIMSELF OR BE CALLED BY OTHERS AN OLD MAN IS PROVED BY THAT FACT ALONE TO BE ONE OF WEARING HARDSHIPS AND EARLY DECAY OF THE VITAL POWERS
FROM WEEK TO WEEK THE PROGRESS OF THE TALISMAN IMPEDED BY BAD WEATHER AND FLOATING ICE WAS FAITHFULLY RECORDED UNTIL AT LAST THE PARTY WITH LONG-HANDLED AXES WENT DOWN TO BEARDSTOWN TO WELCOME HER
NOR DO I THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO REPLY TO SUCH A CHARGE AS THAT THE WHIGS ARE NOT FRIENDS OF THEIR COUNTRY BECAUSE MANY OF THEM DOUBT THE JUSTICE OR EXPEDIENCY OF THE PRESENT WAR
A NORTH CAROLINA MEMBER MOVED TO STRIKE OUT THIS CLAUSE
BUT FOR SHERIFF JONES AND HIS SUPERIORS THE PRETEXT WAS ALL SUFFICIENT
THEY SPENT THEIR MONEY MOSTLY IN PRINTER'S INK AND IN THE PAYMENT OF ACTIVE AND ZEALOUS COLPORTEURS
MEN CAME TOGETHER FOR RAISINGS WHERE A HOUSE WAS BUILT IN A DAY
MR CLINGMAN CHALLENGING THE HOUSE WITH THE BROAD STATEMENT THAT IT IS A MISNOMER TO SPEAK OF OUR INSTITUTION AT THE SOUTH AS PECULIAR
AND HIS ANXIETY TO APPEAR RECKLESS AND DANGEROUS AND YET KEEP WITHIN THE STATUTE AND SAVE HIS SALARY WAS DEPICTED BY MERRYMAN WITH A DROLL FIDELITY
ROBERT S
THE SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF WASHINGTON WERE BROUGHT TO BEAR AGAINST A PROPOSITION WHICH THE SOUTHERNERS CONTENDED WOULD VULGARIZE SOCIETY AND THE GENIAL AND LIBERAL MAYOR WAS FORCED TO WITHDRAW HIS APPROVAL AS GRACEFULLY OR AS AWKWARDLY AS HE MIGHT
REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE STEPHEN A
SEVERAL YEARS LATER WHEN HE WAS A PRACTICING LAWYER AN AGENT OF THE POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT CALLED UPON HIM AND ASKED FOR A BALANCE DUE FROM THE NEW SALEM OFFICE SOME SEVENTEEN DOLLARS
IT WAS AN EXCELLENT STORY UNTIL THE NEXT WEEK WHEN DR MERRYMAN WHO SEEMS TO HAVE WIELDED A PEN LIKE A SCALPEL GAVE A MUCH FULLER HISTORY OF THE MATTER WHICH HE SUBSTANTIATED BY PRINTING ALL THE DOCUMENTS AND NOT CONTENT WITH THAT GAVE LITTLE DETAILS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS WHICH SHOW EITHER THAT WHITESIDES WAS ONE OF THE MOST GROTESQUE BRAGGARTS OF THE TIME OR THAT MERRYMAN WAS AN ADMIRABLE WRITER OF COMIC FICTION
THE MEETINGS AT THE STATE FAIR WERE OF A DIFFERENT CHARACTER
UNDER THE SANCTION OF THESE LAWS AND BEFORE THEY COULD BY ANY POSSIBILITY BE REPEALED SOME THOUSANDS MIGHT BE EXPECTED ESPECIALLY BY SUCH AN ORGANIZED AND UNITED EFFORT AS THE SOUTH COULD MAKE TO MAINTAIN THE VANTAGE GROUND ALREADY GAINED
BUT THE PLACE HE WAS REASONABLY SURE OF FILLING IN THE BATTLE OF LIFE SHOULD HAVE MADE A SUBORDINATE OFFICE IN WASHINGTON A THING OUT OF THE QUESTION
HE RELIED MORE UPON HIS INFLUENCE WITH A JURY THAN UPON HIS KNOWLEDGE OF LAW IN THE FEW CASES HE CONDUCTED IN COURT HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH HUMAN NATURE BEING FAR MORE EXTENSIVE THAN HIS LEGAL LORE
LED BY A FEW MEMBERS FROM THAT REGION IN THE MAIN THE WEST VOTED FOR IT AND THE SOUTH AGAINST IT
YET WHEN THE WAR CAME AND THE GRECIAN FORCES WERE MARSHALED ON THE PLAIN AND THEIR CROOKED KEELS WERE SEEN CUTTING THE SANDS OF THE TROJAN COAST HECTOR WAS A FLAMING FIRE HIS BEAMING HELMET WAS SEEN IN THE THICKEST OF THE FIGHT
FOR THIS SORT OF OUTRAGE IS USUALLY ACCOMPLISHED WITH A CURIOUS FORMALITY WHICH MAKES IT SEEM TO THE PARTICIPANTS LEGAL AND ORDERLY
HE WAS MORE PUNCTUAL THAN EITHER HIS EMPLOYER OR THE MERCHANDISE AND MET WITH THE USUAL REWARD OF PUNCTUALITY IN BEING FORCED TO WASTE HIS TIME IN WAITING FOR THE TARDY ONES
THE ENTIRE POPULAR VOTE EXCLUSIVE OF SOUTH CAROLINA WHICH CHOSE ITS ELECTORS BY THE LEGISLATURE WAS FOR TAYLOR 1,360,752
NOR DID HE OWE HIS POLITICAL FORTUNES ENTIRELY TO ACCIDENT
VERMONT IN 1791 FREE
ON THE 9TH OF OCTOBER AT A SEPARATE ELECTION HELD BY THE FREE-STATE PARTY ALONE UNDER SELF-PRESCRIBED FORMALITIES AND REGULATIONS THESE WERE DULY CHOSEN BY AN AGGREGATE VOTE OF 2710 EX-GOVERNOR REEDER RECEIVING AT THE SAME POLLS 2849 VOTES FOR DELEGATE
71 BUT TRANSFERS IT TO A TIME FOUR YEARS LATER WHEN LINCOLN HAD PERMANENTLY ASSUMED SHOES AND HAD A HORSE OF HIS OWN WE HOPE LINCOLN'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FUN WERE BETTER THAN THIS BUT OF COURSE THE PROSPERITY OF THESE JESTS LAY RATHER IN THE LIBERAL EARS THAT HEARD THEM THAN IN THE GOOD-NATURED TONGUES THAT UTTERED THEM
THE ATTITUDE OF THE OPPOSITION--SURE OF THEIR ADVANTAGE AND EXULTING IN IT--WAS NEVER PERHAPS MORE CLEARLY AND STRONGLY SET FORTH THAN IN A SPEECH MADE BY MR LINCOLN NEAR THE CLOSE OF THIS SESSION
MRS LINCOLN NOT LONG BEFORE HER DEATH GAVE STRIKING TESTIMONY OF HIS WINNING AND LOYAL CHARACTER
THE ABLEST SPEECHES OF THE DAY BEFORE BECAME OBSOLETE IN THE PRESENCE OF ACCOMPLISHED FACTS
AND IF ELECTED THEY WILL HAVE CONFERRED A FAVOR UPON ME FOR WHICH I SHALL BE UNREMITTING IN MY LABORS TO COMPENSATE
I AM PREPARED TO DO IT
THROUGH SUFFERING AND DEATH BY DISEASE AND IN BATTLE THEY HAVE ENDURED AND FOUGHT AND FALLEN WITH YOU
ZACHARY TAYLOR RELOCATED FOOTNOTE 1
BUT ON THAT OTHER SUBJECT TO ME OF THE MOST INTENSE INTEREST WHETHER IN JOY OR SORROW I NEVER HAD THE POWER TO WITHHOLD MY SYMPATHY FROM YOU
BUT THEY WOKE AN ECHO IN ONE SINCERE HEART WHICH HISTORY WILL BE GLAD TO PERPETUATE
THOUGH THE REPEAL WAS FORCED THROUGH CONGRESS UNDER PARTY PRESSURE AND BY THE SHEER WEIGHT OF A LARGE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN BOTH BRANCHES IT MET FROM THE FIRST A DECIDED AND UNMISTAKABLE POPULAR CONDEMNATION IN THE FREE STATES
HE DID A MAN'S WORK FROM THE TIME HE LEFT SCHOOL
AS A RESULT WHITFIELD RECEIVED WITHOUT COMPETITION THE COMBINED PRO-SLAVERY AND BORDER RUFFIAN VOTE FOR DELEGATE ON THE FIRST OF OCTOBER A TOTAL OF 2721 BALLOTS
HE HAD SCALPED HIS FIRST ENEMY WHEN SCARCELY MORE THAN A CHILD HAVING PAINTED ON HIS BLANKET THE BLOOD-RED HAND WHICH MARKED HIS NOBILITY AT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE
WE CLAIM FOR OUR WORK THAT WE HAVE DEVOTED TO IT TWENTY YEARS OF ALMOST UNREMITTING ASSIDUITY
MATTESON
IT IS ALTOGETHER LIKELY THAT THIS FORMED THE LEADING INDUCEMENT TO HIS TAKING THE OFFICE
THE EXCITEMENT WHICH HAD REIGNED IN KANSAS DURING THE WHOLE SUMMER OF 1855 FIRST ABOUT THE ENACTMENTS OF THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE AND THEN IN REGARD TO THE FORMATION OF THE TOPEKA CONSTITUTION WAS NOW EXTENDED TO THE AMERICAN CONGRESS WHERE IT RAGED FOR TWO LONG MONTHS OVER THE ELECTION OF SPEAKER BANKS
IT HAD LONG BEEN HELD UP TO PUBLIC ODIUM AS A REVOLUTIONARY BAND OF ABOLITIONISTS MOST OF THE ABOLITIONISTS WERE DOUBTLESS IN THIS PARTY BUT THE PARTY WAS NOT ALL COMPOSED OF ABOLITIONISTS
BUT HE MUST STOP AND VINDICATE THE TRUTH WHENEVER ASSAILED
BUT WHAT ANSWERED THEIR PURPOSES JUST AS WELL 4408 MISSOURIANS HAD CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR THEM MAKING THEIR TOTAL CONSTITUENCY IF BY DISCARDING THE IDEA OF A STATE LINE WE USE THE WORD IN A SOMEWHAT STRAINED SENSE 5427
A SIMILAR BILL SIGNED BY HIM FIFTEEN YEARS LATER
THE MISSIONARIES OF THIS NEW SYSTEM IN ILLINOIS WERE STEPHEN A
BUT ITS CHIEF VALUE IS CONCEDED TO HAVE BEEN ITS SIXTH ARTICLE ORDAINING THE IMMEDIATE AND PERPETUAL PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY
BUT AS I UNDERSTAND HE STANDS READY TO GIVE JUST SUCH A VOTE WHENEVER AN OCCASION SHALL PRESENT
NINIAN EDWARDS SON OF THE LATE GOVERNOR IS SAID TO HAVE OPENED THE DEBATE WITH MUCH EFFECT
A SENATOR WAS TO BE ELECTED AND SHIELDS HAD ACQUIRED SUCH A HABIT OF TAKING ALL THE OFFICES THAT FELL VACANT THAT IT WAS ONLY PRUDENT TO REMOVE HIM AS FAR AS CONVENIENT FROM SUCH A TEMPTATION
AND THOUGH IT HAS BEEN IN USE FOR NEARLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS IT IS VIRTUALLY UNIMPROVED
THE NEBRASKA BILL WITH ITS REPEALING CLAUSE HAD BEEN BEFORE THE COUNTRY SOME THREE WEEKS AND WAS YET PENDING IN CONGRESS WHEN A MEMBER OF THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED RESOLUTIONS INDORSING IT
THEY WERE NOT ONLY WELL ARMED AND SUPPLIED BUT WROUGHT UP TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF PARTISAN EXCITEMENT
I TELL YOU SPEED OUR FOREBODINGS FOR WHICH YOU AND I ARE PECULIAR ARE ALL THE WORST SORT OF NONSENSE
A WOMAN WAS SOMETIMES ALARMED BY A VISIT FROM A DRUNKEN SAVAGE
THIS AFFAIR OF APPOINTMENTS TO OFFICE IS VERY ANNOYING--MORE SO TO YOU THAN TO ME DOUBTLESS
THE FIRST ANCESTOR OF THE LINE OF WHOM WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE WAS SAMUEL LINCOLN OF NORWICH ENGLAND WHO CAME TO HINGHAM MASSACHUSETTS IN 1638 AND DIED THERE
THE BEARDLESS BOY AND THE MATURE MAN THE HUMBLE AND THE DISTINGUISHED,--YOU HAVE HAD THEM
THE BANKS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES HAD SUSPENDED SPECIE PAYMENTS IN THE SPRING AND AS THE STATE BANKS IN ILLINOIS WERE THE FISCAL AGENTS OF THE RAILROADS AND CANALS THE GOVERNOR CALLED UPON THE LAW-MAKERS TO REVISE THEIR OWN WORK TO LEGALIZE THE SUSPENSION AND BRING THEIR IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM WITHIN POSSIBLE BOUNDS
GRAVE DOUBTS HOWEVER FOUND OCCASIONAL EXPRESSION AND NONE PERHAPS MORE FORCIBLY THAN IN THE FOLLOWING NEWSPAPER EPIGRAM--DESCRIBING FINALITY
THOSE WHO HELD SLAVES UNDER THE FRENCH DOMINATION AND THEIR HEIRS CONTINUED TO HOLD THEM AND THEIR DESCENDANTS IN SERVITUDE AFTER ILLINOIS HAD BECOME NOMINALLY A FREE TERRITORY AND A FREE STATE ON THE GROUND THAT THEIR VESTED RIGHTS OF PROPERTY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABROGATED BY THE ORDINANCE AND THAT UNDER THE RULE OF THE CIVIL LAW PARTUS SEQUITUR VENTREM
HE HAD HELD THE OFFICE OF INDIAN AGENT AND HIS ACQUAINTANCE EXPERIENCE AND THE PRINCIPAL FACT THAT HE WAS THE FAVORITE OF THE CONSPIRATORS GAVE HIM AN EASY VICTORY
IN MAY GENERAL ARISTA CROSSED THE RIVER AND ATTACKED GENERAL TAYLOR ON THE FIELD OF PALO ALTO WHERE TAYLOR WON THE FIRST OF THAT REMARKABLE SERIES OF VICTORIES EMBRACING RESACA DE LA PALMA MONTEREY AND BUENA VISTA ALL GAINED OVER SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE ENEMY WHICH MADE THE AMERICAN COMMANDER FOR THE BRIEF DAY THAT WAS LEFT HIM THE IDOL ALIKE OF SOLDIERS AND VOTERS
THESE REPRESENTATIONS SEEMED TO AVAIL NOTHING HOWEVER AND THE PARTIES AFTER ENDLESS TALK WENT TO ALTON AND CROSSED THE RIVER TO THE MISSOURI SHORE
THE WHIGS NOMINATED A RESPECTABLE MAN NAMED BROWN BUT A SHORT WHILE BEFORE THE ELECTION JOHN HENRY A MEMBER OF THE STATE SENATE ANNOUNCED HIMSELF AS A CANDIDATE AND APPEALED FOR VOTES ON THE SOLE GROUND THAT HE WAS A POOR MAN AND WANTED THE PLACE FOR THE MILEAGE
TO THE MEN WHO GO THERE FROM SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE SOUTH AND THE WEST THE BUSTLE AND STIR THE INTELLECTUAL MOVEMENT SUCH AS IT IS THE ORDINARY SUBJECTS OF CONVERSATION OF SUCH VASTLY GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN ANYTHING THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY KNOWN THE DAILY EVEN HOURLY COMBATS ON THE FLOOR OF BOTH HOUSES THE INTRIGUE AND THE STRUGGLE OF OFFICE-HUNTING WHICH ENGAGE VAST NUMBERS BESIDES THE OFFICE-SEEKERS THE SUPERIOR PIQUANCY AND INTEREST OF THE SCANDAL WHICH IS TALKED AT A CONGRESSIONAL BOARDING-HOUSE OVER THAT WHICH SEASONS THE DULL DAYS AT VILLAGE-TAVERNS--ALL THIS GIVES A SAVOR TO LIFE IN WASHINGTON THE MEMORY OF WHICH DOUBLES THE TEDIUM OF THE SEQUESTERED VALE TO WHICH THE BEATEN LEGISLATOR RETURNS WHEN HIS BRIEF HOUR OF GLORY IS OVER
IT WAS ENTIRELY INTRUSTED TO HIM TO MANAGE
HE RETURNED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE WINTER OF 1835-6 AND ONE OF THE FIRST IMPORTANT INCIDENTS OF THE SESSION WAS THE ELECTION OF A SENATOR TO FILL THE VACANCY OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF ELIAS KENT KANE
DEAR STUART
THAT BECOMING BEWILDERED IN THE VASTNESS OF A NEW YORK HOTEL HE PROCURED A HATCHET AND IN PIONEER FASHION BLAZED HIS WAY ALONG THE MAHOGANY STAIRCASES AND PAINTED CORRIDORS FROM THE OFFICE TO HIS ROOM
A PROPITIOUS MOMENT FOR CARRYING IT OUT SEEMED NOW TO HAVE ARRIVED
LINCOLN'S POSITION AMONG THE EIGHT DEFEATED CANDIDATES WAS A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
THE DISCUSSION WAS EVIDENTLY EXHAUSTIVE GOING OVER THE WHOLE HISTORY POLICY AND CONSTITUTIONALITY OF PROHIBITORY LEGISLATION
BUT IN 1780 AND 1781 A LARGE NUMBER OF FAMILIES TOOK UP THEIR LINE OF MARCH AND IN THE LATTER YEAR A CONSIDERABLE CONTINGENT OF WOMEN JOINED THE LITTLE ARMY OF PIONEERS IMPELLED BY AN INSTINCT WHICH THEY THEMSELVES PROBABLY BUT HALF COMPREHENDED
CARLIN WAS ELECTED AND FINDING THAT A MAJORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS STILL OPPOSED TO ANY STEPS BACKWARD HE MADE NO DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE SYSTEM AT THE FIRST SESSION
THE COVETED APPOINTMENT WAS GIVEN TO A MAN ALREADY LOADED TO A GROTESQUE DEGREE WITH POLITICAL EMPLOYMENT MR LINCOLN'S OLD ADVERSARY JAMES SHIELDS HE HAD LEFT THE POSITION OF AUDITOR OF STATE TO ASSUME A SEAT ON THE BENCH
BUT THE PRINCIPAL USE HE MADE OF HIS STRENGTH AND HIS PRESTIGE WAS IN THE CAPACITY OF PEACEMAKER AN OFFICE WHICH SOON DEVOLVED UPON HIM BY GENERAL CONSENT
THE LAWYERS IN WHAT WAS CALLED GOOD PRACTICE EARNED LESS THAN A STREET SWEEPER TO-DAY
SOMETIMES EMPLOYED HIS CLERKLY HAND IN STRAIGHTENING UP A NEGLECTED LEDGER
NANCY HANKS LINCOLN MOTHER OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN DIED OCTOBER 5TH A
THE LINCOLNS IN NAMING THEIR CHILDREN FOLLOWED SO STRICT A TRADITION THAT GREAT CONFUSION HAS ARISEN IN THE ATTEMPT TO TRACE THEIR GENEALOGY
HERE THEY DONNED THEIR GARMENTS OF RED FLANNEL AND COARSE CLOTH OR BUCKSKIN THRUST THE LEGS OF THEIR TROUSERS INSIDE THE TOPS OF THEIR HEAVY BOOTS AND WORE THEIR BOWIE-KNIFE OR REVOLVER IN THEIR OUTSIDE BELT
BY THE END OF THE WEEK THE LEGISLATURE HAD DEPARTED FROM THE BUDDING CAPITAL TO RETURN NO MORE
LONG BEFORE THE TIME FOR ACTION ARRIVED THE IDEA THAT KANSAS MUST BE A SLAVE STATE HAD GROWN INTO A FIXED AND DETERMINED PUBLIC SENTIMENT
BOTH A REAL AND A PRETENDED FEAR THAT SLAVERY WAS IN DANGER LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS DESIGN
THIS WILD CHIVALRY OF LICK CREEK WAS HOWEVER LESS REDOUBTABLE TO LINCOLN THAN IT MIGHT BE TO AN URBAN STATESMAN UNACQUAINTED WITH THE FROLIC BRUTALITY OF CLARY'S GROVE
OHIO IN 1802 FREE
THE RESULT OF ITS TWO DAYS DELIBERATIONS WAS A REGULARLY CHOSEN DELEGATE CONVENTION HELD AT BIG SPRINGS A FEW MILES WEST OF LAWRENCE ON THE 5TH OF SEPTEMBER 1855
THERE WAS A LONG DISTANCE TO BE TRAVERSED BETWEEN THE GUARDED UTTERANCES OF THIS PROTEST AND THE HEROIC AUDACITY WHICH LAUNCHED THE PROCLAMATION OF EMANCIPATION
NATURE HAD MADE IT MERELY A PLEASANT HUNTING-GROUND
ALSO COMPARE TWO COPIES OF THE INDICTMENTS PRINTED AT FULL LENGTH IN PHILLIPS CONQUEST OF KANSAS PP
HE WAS ALREADY APPROACHING THE ALLOTTED TERM OF LIFE
PRESIDENT PIERCE IN HIS SPECIAL MESSAGE OF JANUARY 24 DECLARED WHAT HAD BEEN DONE BY THE TOPEKA MOVEMENT TO BE OF A REVOLUTIONARY CHARACTER WHICH WOULD BECOME TREASONABLE INSURRECTION IF IT REACH THE LENGTH OF ORGANIZED RESISTANCE FOLLOWING THIS CAME HIS PROCLAMATION OF FEBRUARY 11 LEVELED AGAINST COMBINATIONS FORMED TO RESIST THE EXECUTION OF THE TERRITORIAL LAWS EARLY IN MAY CHIEF-JUSTICE LECOMPTE HELD A TERM OF HIS COURT DURING WHICH HE DELIVERED TO THE GRAND JURY HIS FAMOUS INSTRUCTIONS ON CONSTRUCTIVE TREASON
AND SECONDLY THAT THERE WAS A SLIGHT IMPERFECTION IN THE RECORD BY WHICH COUNSEL MIGHT THROW THE CASE OVER TO THE DECEMBER TERM AND SAVE THE ALIEN VOTE FOR VAN BUREN AND THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET
IN THE MIDST OF GREAT AND INCREASING EXCITEMENT DAN STONE AND JOHN CALHOUN MADE SPEECHES WHICH DID NOT TEND TO POUR OIL ON THE WATERS OF CONTENTION AND THEN CAME MR LINCOLN'S TURN
SECOND THE WHOLE SCHEME WAS IN THE INTEREST OF THE OHIO COMPANY A NEWLY FORMED MASSACHUSETTS EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY WHICH IMMEDIATELY MADE A LARGE PURCHASE OF LANDS
COULD A REPEAL BE CARRIED
THE WILMOT PROVISO
THE WILMOT PROVISO
THE CONVENTION MET AT PEKIN AND NOMINATED HARDIN WITH ALL THE CUSTOMARY SYMPTOMS OF SPONTANEOUS ENTHUSIASM
TO HIS FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WHO WERE UNUSED TO SUCH FINELY WROUGHT AND EVEN FANTASTIC SORROWS HIS TROUBLE SEEMED SO EXAGGERATED THAT THEY COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR IT ON THE GROUND OF INSANITY
THE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS OF THOSE DAYS WERE CONDUCTED ON PURELY DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES
WHEN THE CITIZENS OF LAWRENCE ROSE ON THE 21ST OF MAY THEY BEHELD THEIR TOWN INVESTED BY A FORMIDABLE MILITARY FORCE
THE COUNTY OF SANGAMON WAS CALLED BY AN ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN 1821 OUT OF A VERDANT SOLITUDE OF MORE THAN A MILLION ACRES INHABITED BY A FEW FAMILIES
WHERE DID LINCOLN LEARN HIS SURVEYING I ASKED
OF THE VOTES CAST 1410 WERE UPON A SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION FOUND TO HAVE BEEN LEGAL WHILE 4908 WERE ILLEGAL
NEWPORT WAS YET A GREAT SLAVE-MART AND THE COMMERCE OF NEW ENGLAND DREW MORE ADVANTAGE FROM THE TRAFFIC THAN DID THE AGRICULTURE OF THE SOUTH
I CAN SAY WHAT SCARCELY ONE MOTHER IN A THOUSAND CAN SAY ABE NEVER GAVE ME A CROSS WORD OR LOOK AND NEVER REFUSED IN FACT OR APPEARANCE TO DO ANYTHING I ASKED HIM
SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE GIVEN THAT DESCRIPTION OF HIM
181 A RESTLESS FEELING OF HAZARDOUS SPECULATION SEEMED TO BE TAKING POSSESSION OF THE STATE
OF COURSE IN THE TEN DAYS LEFT HIM AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE FIELD A CANVASS OF THE COUNTY WHICH WAS THEN--BEFORE ITS DIVISION--SEVERAL THOUSAND SQUARE MILES IN EXTENT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
IN CONGRESS ESPECIALLY IT HAD NOW BEEN A SUBJECT OF ANGRY CONTENTION FOR A WHOLE GENERATION
CHAPTER V LINCOLN IN THE BLACK HAWK WAR SIDENOTE
SHREWDLY NOTING ALL THESE SIGNS THE DEMOCRATS OF SANGAMON ORGANIZED WHAT IS KNOWN IN WESTERN POLITICS AS A STILL-HUNT THEY MADE A FEINT OF ALLOWING THE SPECIAL ELECTION TO GO BY DEFAULT
ONE NOTICEABLE FACT IS OBSERVED IN RELATION TO THE POLITICIANS OF THE DAY--THEIR CAREERS WERE GENERALLY BRIEF
THE SIMPLE AND HONEST WORDS OF JOHN HANKS LEAVE NO DOUBT OF THIS
ON THE OTHER HAND THE UNION OF THE ACTUAL INHABITANTS OF KANSAS SCATTERED IN SPARSE SETTLEMENTS PERSONAL STRANGERS TO EACH OTHER COMING FROM WIDELY SEPARATED STATES AND COMPRISING RADICALLY DIFFERENT MANNERS SENTIMENTS AND TRADITIONS AND BURDENED WITH THE PRIME AND UNYIELDING NECESSITY OF PROTECTING THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AGAINST COLD AND HUNGER WAS IN THE VERY NATURE OF THE CASE SLOW AND DIFFICULT
GOOD LAWYERS GENERALLY BELIEVED THIS PROVISION REPUGNANT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND THAT THE QUALIFICATIONS OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES THEREIN PRESCRIBED COULD BE NEITHER INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED BY A STATE
DURING HIS FIRST SESSION LINCOLN OCCUPIED NO ESPECIALLY CONSPICUOUS POSITION
THIS ORDER WAS NATURALLY TAKEN BY THE WHIGS AS INDICATING ON THE PART OF THESE OFFICERS A KEENER INTEREST IN THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR SALARIES THAN IN THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND IT WAS THEREFORE SEVERELY ATTACKED IN ALL THE OPPOSITION NEWSPAPERS OF THE STATE
THOMAS LINCOLN SEAL RICHARD BERRY SEAL WITNESS JOHN H
AND HIS SPECIAL PERSONAL FRIEND AND POLITICAL LIEUTENANT IN HIS OWN STATE WILLIAM A
BY THE FAILING LIGHT A SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS WAS DISCOVERED ON THE SUMMIT OF A HILL A MILE AWAY AND A FEW COURAGEOUS GENTLEMEN HURRIEDLY SADDLED THEIR HORSES AND WITHOUT ORDERS RODE AFTER THEM

THE INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WAS KEPT UP AFTER THE BOONES HAD REMOVED TO NORTH CAROLINA AND JOHN LINCOLN HAD GONE TO VIRGINIA
NEXT A GAMBLING SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE
I AM SIR WITH EVERY CONSIDERATION YOURS RESPECTFULLY MINOR LINCOLN OF THE STAUNTON STOCK OF LINCOLNS THERE WAS A YOUNG ABRAHAM LINCOLN ON THE CONFEDERATE SIDE IN THE SHENANDOAH DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS COURAGE AND FEROCITY
IT NEXT OCCURRED TO HIM TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PROPERTY WAS WORTH AND DOUBTING HIS OWN SKILL HE ENGAGED LINCOLN TO MAKE AN INVOICE OF IT
THE FREE-STATE MEN SHRANK FROM FORCIBLE RESISTANCE TO EVEN BOGUS LAWS
UNDER SO LAX A PROVISION MISSOURI INVADERS COULD IN THE FUTURE AS THEY HAD IN THE PAST EASILY GIVE AN APPARENT MAJORITY AT THE BALLOT-BOX FOR ALL THEIR NECESSARY AGENTS AND ULTERIOR SCHEMES
EVEN IN ORDINARY TIMES THERE STILL REMAINED WITHIN THE REACH OF AVERAGE INTELLECTS SEVERAL HIGHER GRADES OF PUBLIC SERVICE
THEY HAD SEEN THEIR PARTY PUT IN DEADLY PERIL BY REASON OF ITS FIDELITY TO THE SOUTH AND THEY HAD SEEN HOW LITTLE THEIR SOUTHERN BRETHREN CARED FOR THEIR LABORS AND SACRIFICES IN THE ENORMOUS GAINS WHICH TAYLOR HAD MADE IN THE SOUTH CARRYING EIGHT OUT OF FIFTEEN SLAVE STATES
THEIR REGULAR CONSULTATIONS THEIR OPEN DENUNCIATIONS AND THEIR HINTS AT VIOLENCE WHILE THEY DID NOT ENTIRELY OVERAWE THE GOVERNOR SO FAR PRODUCED THEIR INTENDED EFFECT UPON HIM THAT HE ASSEMBLED A BAND OF HIS PERSONAL FRIENDS FOR HIS OWN PROTECTION
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE SOUTH CONTROLLING A MAJORITY OF SLAVE STATES WAS OF COURSE A UNIT IN ITS FAVOR
LINCOLN AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY-THREE YEARS AFTER A LIFE WHICH THOUGH NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ANY MATERIAL OR WORLDLY POINT OF VIEW WAS PROBABLY FAR HAPPIER THAN THAT OF HIS ILLUSTRIOUS SON BEING UNVEXED BY ENTERPRISE OR AMBITION
BESIDES HIS LONG OFFICIAL CAREER GAVE TO HIS UTTERANCES THE STAMP AND GLITTER OF ORACULAR STATESMANSHIP
AS IT WAS THE FLOWER OF THE YOUNG MEN CAME WITH HIM WHEN WITH THE OPENING SPRING HE CROSSED THE RIVER ONCE MORE
HIS STRENGTH AND STATURE WERE ALREADY FAR BEYOND THOSE OF ORDINARY MEN
IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE WHIGS AND OTHER OPPONENTS OF THE WAR SHOULD TAKE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT THEIR OPINION OF SUCH A MISREPRESENTATION

A MINORITY IS ALWAYS STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF INDEPENDENT ACTION AND BITTERLY OPPOSED TO CAUCUSES AND THEREFORE WE NEED NOT BE SURPRISED AT FINDING MR LINCOLN A FEW DAYS LATER IN THE SESSION JOINING IN HEARTY DENUNCIATION OF THE CONVENTION SYSTEM WHICH HAD ALREADY BECOME POPULAR IN THE EAST AND WHICH GENERAL JACKSON WAS THEN URGING UPON HIS FAITHFUL FOLLOWERS

THIS DEMORALIZING DOCTRINE HAD BEEN PROMULGATED BY JACKSON AND ACTED UPON FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT IT WAS TOO MUCH TO EXPECT OF HUMAN NATURE THAT THE WHIGS SHOULD NOT ADOPT IT PARTIALLY AT LEAST WHEN THEIR TURN CAME BUT WE ARE LEFT IN NO DOUBT AS TO THE WAY IN WHICH LINCOLN REGARDED THE UNSEEMLY SCRAMBLE

AND DENOUNCED THE PROPOSITION OF CALHOUN TO PUT A BALANCE OF POWER CLAUSE INTO THE CONSTITUTION AS A RETROGRADE MOVEMENT IN AN AGE OF PROGRESS THAT WOULD ASTONISH THE WORLD THESE REPEATED AFFIRMATIONS TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH HIS FAMOUS DESCRIPTION OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE IN 1849 IN WHICH HE DECLARED IT TO HAVE HAD AN ORIGIN AKIN TO THE CONSTITUTION AND TO HAVE BECOME CANONIZED IN THE HEARTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS A SACRED THING WHICH NO RUTHLESS HAND WOULD EVER BE RECKLESS ENOUGH TO DISTURB ALL SEEMED IN THE PUBLIC MIND TO FIX HIS POSITION DEFINITELY

THE PROSPECT OF POSSESSING A FOUR-HUNDRED-ACRE FARM BY MERELY OCCUPYING IT AND THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING A BASKETFUL OF ALMOST WORTHLESS CONTINENTAL CURRENCY FOR AN UNLIMITED ESTATE AT THE NOMINAL VALUE OF FORTY CENTS PER ACRE WERE IRRESISTIBLE TO THOUSANDS OF LAND-LOVING VIRGINIANS AND CAROLINIANS WHOSE AMBITION OF PROPRIETORSHIP WAS LARGER THAN THEIR MEANS

WHEN THE RETURNED VOLUNTEERS ARE RUNNING FOR CONSTABLE IN EVERY COUNTY
MEASURES HAD MEANWHILE BEEN PERFECTED BY THE FREE-STATE MEN TO ELECT DELEGATES TO A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION
A LAST GLIMPSE OF HIS IMPERIOUS CURIOSITY KEPT ALIVE BY SAUCY HOPES AND FEARS IS SEEN IN HIS LETTER TO SPEED OF THE 5TH OF OCTOBER
HE EMPLOYED HIS SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE MERELY AS A BREAD-WINNER AND MADE SO LITTLE PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE THAT WHEN MR VAN BERGEN WHO HAD PURCHASED THE RADFORD NOTE SUED AND GOT JUDGMENT ON IT HIS HORSE AND HIS SURVEYING INSTRUMENTS WERE TAKEN TO PAY THE DEBT AND ONLY BY THE GENEROUS INTERVENTION OF A FRIEND WAS HE ABLE TO REDEEM THESE INVALUABLE MEANS OF LIVING
WE SHALL QUOTE RATHER FULLY FROM ADDRESSES DELIVERED BY JUSTICE DAVID DAVIS OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AND BY JUDGE DRUMMOND THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR ILLINOIS
DEAR JOHNSTON
THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE FAILED BUT THE WAR ENDED AND NEW MEXICO AND CALIFORNIA WERE ADDED TO THE UNION AS UNORGANIZED TERRITORIES
OF THESE ONLY THE ELDEST LIVED TO MATURITY
MCDOUGALL ONCE TOLD US THAT ALTHOUGH HE MADE NO PRETENSE OF CONCEALING HIS EASTERN NATIVITY HE NEVER COULD KEEP HIS ARDENT FRIENDS IN PIKE COUNTY FROM DENYING THE FACT AND FIGHTING ANY ONE WHO ASSERTED IT
THERE ARE CERTAIN TEMPTATIONS THAT NO GOVERNMENT YET INSTITUTED HAS BEEN ABLE TO RESIST
BEFORE THE THIRD NEBRASKA BILL HAD YET BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE SENATE THE THEN LITTLE BAND OF FREE-SOILERS IN CONGRESS--CHASE SUMNER GIDDINGS AND THREE OTHERS--HAD ISSUED A NEWSPAPER ADDRESS CALLING THE REPEAL A GROSS VIOLATION OF A SACRED PLEDGE
THE OPPOSITION MAJORITY WAS MADE UP OF ANTI-NEBRASKA DEMOCRATS OF WHAT WERE THEN CALLED ABOLITIONISTS LOVEJOY HAD BEEN ELECTED AMONG THESE AND FINALLY OF WHIGS WHO NUMBERED BY FAR THE LARGEST PORTION
GOUVERNEUR MORRIS DECLARED THAT AS THEY WERE ONLY PROPERTY THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE REPRESENTED AT ALL
THE PLACE HAD BECOME HIS BY A SORT OF PRESCRIPTION
ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE PIONEER YOU DO NOT EXPECT HIM TO SMILE MUCH BUT NOW AND THEN HE LAUGHS BESIDES THIS GENERIC TENDENCY TO MELANCHOLY VERY MANY OF THE PIONEERS WERE SUBJECT IN EARLY LIFE TO MALARIAL INFLUENCES THE EFFECT OF WHICH REMAINED WITH THEM ALL THEIR DAYS
THEY ACTED AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED
HE HAD VISITED THE GENERAL IN WASHINGTON AND HAD COME BACK GIVING OUT THREATENINGS AND SLAUGHTER AGAINST THE WHIGS IN THE TRUE TENNESSEE STYLE DECLARING THAT ALL WHIGS SHOULD BE WHIPPED OUT OF OFFICE LIKE DOGS OUT OF A MEAT-HOUSE
TO THIS LINCOLN ANSWERED IN HIS USUAL TONE OF GRAVE KINDNESS
BUT HIS CIRCULAR IS DATED MARCH 9 1832 AND THE SANGAMO JOURNAL MENTIONS HIS NAME AMONG THE JULY AND APOLOGIZES CANDIDATES IN FOR HAVING ACCIDENTALLY OMITTED IT IN MAY HE HAD DONE THIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN NATURAL BENT FOR PUBLIC LIFE AND DESIRE FOR USEFULNESS AND DISTINCTION AND NOT WITHOUT STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT FROM FRIENDS WHOSE OPINION HE VALUED
THEY WERE LOOKING AROUND FOR A MAN TO FILL HIS PLACE WHEN MY FATHER NOTICED MR LINCOLN AND ASKED IF HE COULD WRITE
WHAT WE HAVE SAID IN REGARD TO THE GENERAL DISCUSSION PROVOKED BY THE MEXICAN WAR APPEARED NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN THE PART TAKEN BY MR LINCOLN ON THE FLOOR
HE ARRIVED AT A POINT OPPOSITE MATAMORAS ON THE 28TH OF MARCH AND IMMEDIATELY FORTIFIED HIMSELF DISREGARDING THE SUMMONS OF THE MEXICAN COMMANDER WHO WARNED HIM THAT SUCH ACTION WOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A DECLARATION OF WAR
ONE EARLY STATE'S ATTORNEY DESCRIBES HIS FIRST CIRCUIT AS A TOUR OF SHIFTS AND PRIVATIONS NOT UNLIKE THE WANDERINGS OF A MENDICANT FRIAR
IN SIX DISTRICTS THE GOVERNOR ORDERED A SUPPLEMENTARY ELECTION WHICH WAS DULY HELD ON THE 22D OF MAY FOLLOWING
AFTER A YOUTH OF SINGULAR PRIVATIONS AND STRUGGLES HE HAD ARRIVED AT AN ENVIABLE POSITION IN THE POLITICS AND THE SOCIETY OF THE STATE
BUT THE DESPOTIC PURPOSE CLOTHED IN FORMS OF LAW MADE A NONE THE LESS PROFOUND IMPRESSION UPON THE ASSEMBLED CITIZENS AND LATER WHEN THE NEWSPAPERS SPREAD THE REPORT OF THE ACT UPON THE INDIGNANT PUBLIC OF THE NORTHERN STATES
HE GAVE US HIS FULL CONFIDENCE

A VERY BRIEF MENTION OF THE PRINCIPAL LANDMARKS OF THE LONG CONTEST WILL SERVE TO SHOW THE HISTORICAL RELATION AND EXPLAIN THE PHRASEOLOGY OF ITS FINAL ISSUES
DEVOTING HIMSELF WITH DOGGED ENERGY TO THE TASK IN HAND HE SOON LEARNED BY HEART SIX BOOKS OF THE PROPOSITIONS OF EUCLID AND HE RETAINED THROUGH LIFE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRINCIPLES THEY CONTAIN
ONCE HE SAVED THE LIFE OF THE TOWN DRUNKARD WHOM HE FOUND FREEZING BY THE ROADSIDE BY CARRYING HIM IN HIS STRONG ARMS TO THE TAVERN AND WORKING OVER HIM UNTIL HE REVIVED
IT IS NOW UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD IF NOT CONCEDED THAT THE REBELLION OF 1861 WAS BEGUN FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF DEFENDING AND PRESERVING TO THE SECEDING STATES THE INSTITUTION OF AFRICAN SLAVERY AND MAKING THEM THE NUCLEUS OF A GREAT SLAVE EMPIRE WHICH IN THEIR AMBITIOUS DREAMS THEY HOPED WOULD INCLUDE MEXICO CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE WEST INDIA ISLANDS AND PERHAPS EVEN THE TROPICAL STATES OF SOUTH AMERICA
IT IS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR
LINCOLN'S SPEECH AND HIS RESOLUTIONS WERE ALIKE INSPIRED WITH ONE PURPOSE
THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER LINCOLN SERVED AS DEPUTY UNDER CALHOUN OR NEALE
HALE AN INSUBORDINATE DEMOCRAT FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR THE SAME OFFENSE AND AT THE TIME SCREAMING THAT THE BLOOD OF OUR GLORIOUS BATTLE-FIELDS IN MEXICO RESTED ON THE HANDS OF THE PRESIDENT
THE FIRST VOTE STOOD
AND ALTHOUGH I NEVER FAINTED FROM LOSS OF BLOOD I CAN TRULY SAY I WAS OFTEN VERY HUNGRY
WHEN SO GOOD A WHIG AS MR WINTHROP GIVES AS A SENTIMENT AT A PUBLIC MEETING IN BOSTON OUR COUNTRY HOWEVER BOUNDED AND THE MAJORITY OF HIS PARTY ARE PREPARING--UNMINDFUL OF MR POLK AND ALL HIS WORKS--TO REAP THE FRUITS OF THE MEXICAN WAR BY MAKING ITS POPULAR HERO PRESIDENT
AND WHEN THE FIGHTING ONCE BEGAN THERE WAS NOT A RIFLE IN KENTUCKY WHICH COULD RIVAL HIS
I HAVE BECOME PERFECTLY SATISFIED THAT IT IS MY DUTY AS A FAIR-MINDED NATIONAL STATESMAN TO COOPERATE WITH YOU AS PROPOSED IN SECURING THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE RESTRICTION
THE CUSTOM OF PUBLIC POLITICAL DEBATE WHILE IT WAS SHARP AND ACRIMONIOUS ALSO ENGENDERED A SPIRIT OF EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS
HE HAD ONLY TO SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS AT THE VIOLENCE AND UNTRUTHFULNESS OF THE MAJORITY VOTE AGAINST THEM AND GO BACK TO HIS ADMIRING CONSTITUENTS TO HIS DINNERS AND HIS TOASTS
A MAN MIGHT BE REPLACED MORE EASILY THAN THE OTHER ANIMAL
FAC-SIMILE OF LINCOLN'S REPORT OF THE ROAD SURVEY IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT WASHINGTON IN HIS YOUTH ADOPTED THE SAME PROFESSION BUT THERE WERE FEW POINTS OF SIMILARITY IN THE LIVES OF THE TWO GREAT PRESIDENTS IN YOUTH OR LATER MANHOOD
MEANWHILE THE ADMISSION OF WISCONSIN IN 1848 HAD ONCE MORE RESTORED THE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE FREE AND THE SLAVE STATES THERE BEING NOW FIFTEEN OF EACH
OLD FOGIES AND YOUNG AMERICA
THE SPARROWS HUSBAND AND WIFE DIED EARLY IN OCTOBER AND NANCY HANKS LINCOLN FOLLOWED THEM AFTER AN INTERVAL OF A FEW DAYS
AND I CAN SAY AS MR CLAY SAID OF THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS THAT PERSONALLY I WOULD NOT OBJECT TO A REELECTION ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT AT THE TIME OF HIS NOMINATION AND STILL THINK IT WOULD BE QUITE AS WELL FOR ME TO RETURN TO THE LAW AT THE END OF A SINGLE TERM
THAT SUCH TRIVIAL DETAILS ARE STILL RELATED ONLY SHOWS HOW BARREN OF INCIDENT WAS THE LIFE OF THESE OBSCURE FOUNDERS OF A GREAT EMPIRE
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE 1 RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END AND OBTAINED FROM HIM IN WRITING AN AGREEMENT TO ADOPT THE MOVEMENT AS AN ADMINISTRATION MEASURE
THIS ERROR AROSE FROM A CLERICAL BLUNDER IN THE COUNTY RECORD OF MARRIAGES
OF THIS I SUPPOSE TAZEWELL IS SAFE AND I HAVE MUCH DONE IN BOTH THE OTHER COUNTIES
I SUPPOSE I AM NOW ONE OF THE OLD MEN AND I DECLARE ON MY VERACITY WHICH I THINK IS GOOD WITH YOU THAT NOTHING COULD AFFORD ME MORE SATISFACTION THAN TO LEARN THAT YOU AND OTHERS OF MY YOUNG FRIENDS AT HOME WERE DOING BATTLE IN THE CONTEST AND ENDEARING THEMSELVES TO THE PEOPLE AND TAKING A STAND FAR ABOVE ANY I HAVE EVER BEEN ABLE TO REACH IN THEIR ADMIRATION
THERE IS NOT ONLY NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SUCH BARGAIN AMONG THE MEN WE HAVE MENTIONED BUT THERE IS THE CLEAREST PROOF OF THE CONTRARY
THE BILL WAS PASSED ONLY A SHORT TIME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE ADJOURNED AND THE LONG NINE CAME BACK TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS WEARING THEIR WELL-WON LAURELS
THE CROWNING GRACE OF THE WHOLE ACT IS IN THE CLOSING SENTENCE
BUTTERFIELD BROUGHT A SMILE FROM THE COURT AND A LAUGH FROM THE BAR BY ASKING WHETHER WHEN THE LORD LENGTHENED THE LIFE OF HEZEKIAH HE MADE A NEW MAN OR WHETHER IT WAS THE SAME OLD HEZEKIAH CHAPTER XVII THE CIRCUIT LAWYER IN THAT BRIEFEST OF ALL AUTOBIOGRAPHIES WHICH MR LINCOLN WROTE FOR JESSE FELL UPON THREE PAGES OF NOTE-PAPER HE SKETCHED IN THESE WORDS THE PERIOD AT WHICH WE HAVE ARRIVED
AMONG THE COLLEAGUES OF LINCOLN AT VANDALIA WERE YOUNG MEN WITH DESTINIES ONLY LESS BRILLIANT THAN HIS OWN
FROM ALTON TO SHAWNEETOWN
AN ARTICLE IN THE JOURNAL STATES THAT HE SEEMED EMBARRASSED IN HIS OPENING FOR THIS WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTEST IN WHICH HE HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED
IT WAS IN AUGUST OF THE YEAR 1831 THAT HE FINALLY LEFT HIS FATHER'S ROOF AND SWUNG OUT FOR HIMSELF INTO THE CURRENT OF THE WORLD TO MAKE HIS FORTUNE IN HIS OWN WAY
SOME OF THESE REVOLTING CRIMES THOUGH COMPARATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER WERE COMMITTED GENERALLY IN A SPIRIT OF LAWLESS RETALIATION BY FREE STATE MEN
IN ORDER TO TAKE A BOLD STAND THAT THE UNION AND LAW MIGHT NOT BE TRAMPLED IN THE DUST THEY WITH GREAT PAINSTAKING DEVISED AND PASSED AN ACT TO PUNISH OFFENSES AGAINST SLAVE PROPERTY IT PRESCRIBED THE PENALTY OF DEATH NOT MERELY FOR THE GRAVE CRIME OF INCITING OR AIDING AN INSURRECTION OF SLAVES FREE NEGROES OR MULATTOES OR CIRCULATING PRINTED MATTER FOR SUCH AN OBJECT BUT ALSO THE SAME EXTREME PUNISHMENT FOR THE COMPARATIVELY MILD OFFENSE OF ENTICING OR DECOYING AWAY A SLAVE OR ASSISTING HIM TO ESCAPE
WITH SUCH A RADICAL OPPOSITION OF SENTIMENT BOTH FACTIONS WERE ON THE ALERT TO SEIZE EVERY AVAILABLE VANTAGE GROUND

I FEEL THAT IT IS SO EVEN ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT AND PARTICULARLY ON MOTHER'S ACCOUNT
THERE WERE MANY WHO LIVED IN HOVELS SO COLD THAT THEY HAD TO SLEEP ON THEIR SHOES TO KEEP THEM FROM FREEZING TOO STIFF TO BE PUT ON
RISING STEADILY AFTER 1820 THE CONTROVERSY OVER SLAVERY BECAME DEEP AND BITTER BOTH IN CONGRESS AND THE COUNTRY
HIS BEHAVIOR IN THIS IGNOBLE SCUFFLE DID THE WORK OF YEARS FOR HIM IN GIVING HIM THE POSITION HE REQUIRED IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE HIS LOT WAS CAST
THE SPRINGFIELD JOURNAL GIVING THE NEWS THE WEEK AFTER SAID
184 AFTER CAREFUL DELIBERATION COLONEL SUMNER COMMANDING THE UNITED STATES TROOPS AT FORT LEAVENWORTH DECLINED TO INTERFERE WITHOUT EXPLICIT ORDERS FROM THE WAR DEPARTMENT
WE WILL ENGAGE IN COMPETITION FOR THE VIRGIN SOIL OF KANSAS AND GOD GIVE THE VICTORY TO THE SIDE THAT IS STRONGER IN NUMBERS AS IT IS IN RIGHT WITH FIFTEEN MILLIONS IN THE NORTH AGAINST TEN MILLIONS IN THE SOUTH THE RESULT COULD NOT BE IN DOUBT
WHILE SPEED WAS STILL WITH HIM HE WROTE A LONG LETTER WHICH HE PUT INTO HIS HANDS AT PARTING FULL OF WISE AND AFFECTIONATE REASONINGS TO BE READ WHEN HE SHOULD FEEL THE NEED OF IT
IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT THEY SHALL NOT SEEK TO DISTURB NEBRASKA AND KANSAS BUT THEY MUST ACQUIESCE ALSO IN THE PRINCIPLE FOOTNOTE
I DO NOT THINK THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY OUGHT TO AFFECT THE QUESTION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHETHER TEXAS BE INDEPENDENT OR INCORPORATED IN THE UNITED STATES
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE SIGNING OF THE IOWA AND FLORIDA BILL CONGRESS PASSED AND PRESIDENT TYLER SIGNED A JOINT RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE ACQUISITION ANNEXATION AND ADMISSION OF TEXAS
SIR I ONCE RECOGNIZED YOU AS A DEMAGOGUE A MERE PARTY MANAGER SELFISH AND INTRIGUING
THEY HEARD THEIR COUNTRY'S CALL AND CAME TO BATTLE FOR THE RIGHT
AS GENERAL TAYLOR IS PAR EXCELLENCE THE HERO OF THE MEXICAN WAR AND AS YOU DEMOCRATS SAY WE WHIGS HAVE ALWAYS OPPOSED THE WAR YOU THINK IT MUST BE VERY AWKWARD AND EMBARRASSING FOR US TO GO FOR GENERAL TAYLOR

AT FIRST THEY DID NOT SEEM INCLINED TO MOLEST YOUNG LINCOLN
OTHER PARTIES FOLLOWED FROM TIME TO TIME SENDING OUT OFF SHOOTS BUT MAINLY INCREASING THE PARENT SETTLEMENT UNTIL NEXT TO FORT LEAVENWORTH THE PRINCIPAL MILITARY POST LAWRENCE BECAME THE LEADING TOWN OF THE TERRITORY
SEWARD WITH ST THOMAS
AND MANY YEARS AFTER LINCOLN WAS LAID TO SLEEP BENEATH A MOUNTAIN OF MARBLE AT SPRINGFIELD SHIELDS WAS MADE THE SHUTTLECOCK OF CONTENDING DEMAGOGUES IN CONGRESS EACH STRIVING TO MAKE A POINT BY VOTING HIM MONEY--UNTIL IN THE IMPULSE OF THAT TRANSIENT CONTROVERSY THE STATE OF MISSOURI FINDING THE GRAY-HEADED SOLDIER IN HER BORDERS FOR THE THIRD TIME SENT HIM TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR A FEW WEEKS--A HISTORY UNPARALLELED EVEN IN AMERICA
FROM ALTON TO THE EASTERN STATE BOUNDARY--BY VIRTUE OF WHICH LINES ALTON WAS TO TAKE THE LIFE OF ST LOUIS WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE
HIS OATH-BOUND CONFEDERATES GAVE HIM LITTLE ASSISTANCE AND SOON CAST IN THEIR LOT WITH THE STRONGER PARTY
LINCOLN WAS AT THIS TIME A CANDIDATE FOR THE WHIG NOMINATION TO CONGRESS
THEY SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE IT AS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF THEIR EXISTENCE
AT ANOTHER TIME SEEING SOME MEN PREPARING A CONTRIVANCE FOR LIFTING SOME LARGE POSTS ABE QUICKLY SHOULDERED THE POSTS AND TOOK THEM WHERE THEY WERE NEEDED
HE EVEN SPOKE IN CONDEMNATION OF MOBS
WHILE TO SHIELDS SUCH A FRACAS WAS A DELIGHT
AND WE KNOW THAT FAR-SEEING NATION NEVER OMITS A CIRCUMSTANCE IN HER EXTENSIVE INTERCOURSE WITH THE WORLD WHICH CAN BE TURNED TO ACCOUNT IN INCREASING HER MILITARY RESOURCES
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE PROSPECTS OF OUR PARTY SO BRIGHT IN THESE PARTS AS THEY ARE NOW
MOST OF THE SMALL REMAINDER JOINED THEMSELVES TO ONE KIRKPATRICK A MAN OF SOME SUBSTANCE AND STANDING FROM SPRING CREEK
BESIDES HE WAS TOO STRONG A MAN IN THE COURT-ROOM TO BE REGARDED WITH ANYTHING BUT RESPECT IN A COMMUNITY IN WHICH LEGAL ABILITY WAS THE ONLY ESPECIAL MARK OF DISTINCTION
BOW TO IT I NEVER WILL
HE WAS DEFEATED FOR THE ONLY TIME IN HIS LIFE IN A CONTEST BEFORE THE PEOPLE
THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE WAS GETTING ITSELF SETTLED HERE AND THERE
IT HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN PUBLISHED AND IT DESERVES TO BE WRITTEN IN LETTERS OF GOLD ON THE WALLS OF EVERY GYMNASIUM AND COLLEGE
IN SEVERAL STATES IT HAD INSTIGATED ABUSE INTOLERANCE PERSECUTIONS TRIALS MOBS MURDERS DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY IMPRISONMENT OF FREEMEN RETALIATORY LEGISLATION AND ONE WELL-DEFINED AND FORMIDABLE ATTEMPT AT REVOLUTION
BUT THE RISING UNION FEELING QUICKLY SWEPT AWAY ALL EBULLITIONS OF DISCONTENT AND DURING TWO OR THREE YEARS PEOPLE AND POLITICIANS FONDLY DREAMED THEY HAD IN CURRENT PHRASEOLOGY REACHED A FINALITY TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE
HE WAS FOR THAT REASON AN IRRESISTIBLE MARK FOR SATIRE
A SHORT TIME AFTERWARDS ONE REUBEN RADFORD WHO KEPT ANOTHER SHOP OF THE SAME KIND HAPPENED ONE EVENING TO ATTRACT THE DANGEROUS ATTENTION OF THE CLARY'S GROVE BOYS WHO WITH THEIR USUAL PROMPT AND PRACTICAL FACETIOUSNESS WITHOUT A TOUCH OF MALICE IN IT BROKE HIS WINDOWS AND WRECKED HIS STORE
SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS INCENSED AT THE TACTICS OF THE NEBRASKA LEADERS FORMED A KANSAS AID SOCIETY IN WASHINGTON CITY AND CONTRIBUTED MONEY TO ASSIST EMIGRANTS
BUT THEY PERHAPS HAD THEIR INTENDED EFFECT TO AROUSE THE JEALOUSY AND EAGERNESS OF DOUGLAS
HE WAS NEVERTHELESS AN EXCELLENT SURVEYOR
LET NO OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING A MARK ESCAPE
THE MISSOURI BACKWOODS-MEN MANIFESTED AN ALMOST INCREDIBLE INTEREST IN THIS WONDERFUL GUN
EVEN IF MEXICO HAD BEEN INCLINED TO SUBMIT TO THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS IT WAS NEVERTHELESS CERTAIN THAT THE OCCUPATION OF THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIO GRANDE WITHOUT AN ATTEMPT AT AN UNDERSTANDING WOULD BRING ABOUT A COLLISION
BUT LITTLE REMAINS THEN FOR CIVILIZATION RELOCATED FOOTNOTE 3
I SAY THIS BECAUSE I FEAR I SHALL BE UNABLE TO ATTEND TO ANY BUSINESS HERE AND A CHANGE OF SCENE MIGHT HELP ME
JOSHUA SPEED AND WIFE THIS LETTER HAS BEEN PUBLISHED AND SEVERELY CRITICISED AS SHOWING A LACK OF GENTLEMANLIKE FEELING
THEY NEXT ORDERED THE BUILDING OF A JAIL WHICH COST JUST TWICE AS MUCH MONEY AS THE COURT-HOUSE
FOR SUCH REASONS AS THESE MR LINCOLN REFUSED TO ALLOW HIS NAME TO GO BEFORE THE VOTERS AGAIN AND THE NEXT YEAR HE AGAIN REFUSED WRITING AN EMPHATIC LETTER FOR PUBLICATION IN WHICH HE SAID THAT THERE WERE MANY WHIGS WHO COULD DO AS MUCH AS HE TO BRING THE DISTRICT RIGHT SIDE UP COLONEL BAKER HAD COME BACK FROM THE WARS WITH ALL THE GLITTER OF CERRO GORDO ABOUT HIM BUT DID NOT FIND THE PROSPECT OF POLITICAL PREFERMENT FLATTERING IN SANGAMON COUNTY AND THEREFORE WITH THAT VERSATILITY AND SAGACITY WHICH WAS MORE THAN ONCE TO RENDER HIM SIGNAL SERVICE HE REMOVED TO THE GALENA DISTRICT IN THE EXTREME NORTH WESTERN CORNER OF THE STATE AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ON HIS ARRIVAL THERE RECEIVED A NOMINATION TO CONGRESS
THE GREAT BREACH OF FAITH WAS NOT YET EVEN MEDITATED
AND AT THIS TIME OF HIS LIFE HIS IMAGINATION WAS SUFFICIENTLY ALERT TO INFLICT UPON HIM THE SHARPEST ANGUISH
IT IS A TRADITION THAT A PLANTER ONCE WROTE TO HIM
HE FELT INTENSELY THE STUPIDITY OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR BUT THOUGHT HE COULD NOT AVOID THE FIGHT WITHOUT DEGRADATION
TO CORRECT WHAT HE CONSIDERED AN ERROR AND A WRONG
IT WAS WRITTEN ON PAPER ADORNED WITH A PORTRAIT OF JEFFERSON DAVIS AND WAS INCLOSED IN AN ENVELOPE EMBLAZONED WITH THE CONFEDERATE FLAG
THE GRADUAL DISRUPTION OF PARTIES AND THE NEW AND RADICAL ATTITUDES ASSUMED BY MEN OF INDEPENDENT THOUGHT GAVE AMPLE OCCASION TO INDULGE IN SUCH EPITHETS AS APOSTATES RENEGADES AND TRAITORS UNUSUAL ACRIMONY GREW OUT OF THE ZEAL OF THE CHURCH AND ITS MINISTERS
IF I GO OUT THERE I WILL MAKE A BETTER SPEECH THAN I WANT TO HE WAS HARDLY CAPABLE OF THE SEVERE STUDY AND CARE BY WHICH GREAT PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKERS ARE TRAINED
HE LAID THE MATTER BEFORE MAJOR STUART WHO AT ONCE ADVISED HIM TO MAKE THE CANVASS
IT IS VERY PLEASANT FOR ME TO LEARN FROM YON THAT THERE ARE SOME WHO DESIRE THAT I SHOULD BE REELECTED
BUT A QUARTER OF A CENTURY BRINGS WONDERFUL CHANGES
THE PRECEPTS OF THE DIVINE AND THE PENALTIES OF THE HUMAN LAW SAT LIGHTLY UPON THEM
BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH SEEM COMMONPLACE ENOUGH TO COMMONPLACE PEOPLE HE WAS THROWN FOR MORE THAN A YEAR INTO A SEA OF PERPLEXITIES AND SUFFERINGS BEYOND THE REACH OF THE COMMON RUN OF SOULS
MANY FREE COUNTRIES HAVE LOST THEIR LIBERTY AND OURS MAY LOSE HERS
HE NOWHERE ASKS FOR THE REMOVAL OF AN INCUMBENT
A SHORT TIME BEFORE THE ELECTION LINCOLN SAID TO HIM
NEITHER PARTY WAS WILLING TO YIELD HONESTLY NOR READY TO FIGHT MANFULLY
HE WAS AND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN THE TYPE OF THE BACKWOODS PREACHER
THE SANGAMON DISTRICT WAS THE ONE WHICH THE WHIGS OF ILLINOIS HAD APPARENTLY THE BEST PROSPECT OF CARRYING AND IT WAS FULL OF ABLE AND AMBITIOUS MEN WHO WERE NOMINATED SUCCESSIVELY FOR THE ONLY PLACE WHICH GAVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF PLAYING A PART IN THE NATIONAL THEATER AT WASHINGTON
MR ROBERT T
WE HAVE REASON TO THINK THAT THE AFFAIR OF THE DUEL WAS EXCESSIVELY DISTASTEFUL TO LINCOLN
THE VERY INCEPTION OF THE STRUGGLE HAD PROVOKED BITTER WORDS
IT STILL CLUNG TO THE WOODED BORDERS OF THE WATER-COURSES
IT WAS PERHAPS AN INSTINCT RATHER THAN ANY CLEAR SPIRIT OF PROPHECY WHICH DROVE THE ANTISLAVERY DEMOCRATS AWAY FROM THEIR AFFILIATIONS AND KEPT THE WHIGS FOR THE MOMENT SUBSTANTIALLY TOGETHER
A FEW YEARS EARLIER INDEED THE RELATIONS OF THE TWO RACES HAD BEEN MORE STRAINED AS MAY BE INFERRED FROM AN ACT PASSED BY THE TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE IN 1814 OFFERING A REWARD OF FIFTY DOLLARS TO ANY CITIZEN OR RANGER WHO SHOULD KILL OR TAKE ANY DEPREDATING INDIAN
IT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTELY FORGOTTEN
DAMON P
BUT ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS COULD NOT WITHHOLD HIM FROM PERFORMING A SIMPLE DUTY--A DUTY WHICH NO ONE COULD HAVE BLAMED HIM FOR LEAVING UNDONE
THE VIRGINIAN HAD EVERY SOCIAL ADVANTAGE IN HIS FAVOR AND WAS BY NATURE A MAN OF MORE THRIFT AND GREATER SAGACITY IN MONEY MATTERS
OUR REPUBLICAN ROBE IS SOILED AND TRAILED IN THE DUST
ON ANOTHER OCCASION AFTER WEIGHING AND DELIVERING A POUND OF TEA HE FOUND A SMALL WEIGHT ON THE SCALES
AMID ALL THIS WARLIKE PREPARATION TO KEEP THE PEACE NO VERY STRICT MILITARY DISCIPLINE COULD BE IMMEDIATELY ENFORCED
AND A SERVILE WAR RAGES THROUGH THE WHOLE SOUTH AND WEST FOOTNOTE
LINCOLN AS BEFORE GAVE DOUGLAS THE OPENING AND CLOSING SPEECHES EXPLAINING THAT HE WAS WILLING TO YIELD THIS ADVANTAGE IN ORDER TO SECURE A HEARING FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PORTION OF HIS LISTENERS
MARCH 3 1834
AND WHENEVER HE SHALL SPEAK OUT HE WILL SAY SO
HOW FAR I SHALL SUCCEED IN GRATIFYING THIS AMBITION IS YET TO BE DEVELOPED
BEFORE WE CLOSE OUR SKETCH OF THIS PERIOD OF LINCOLN'S LIFE IT MAY NOT BE AMISS TO GLANCE FOR A MOMENT AT THE STATE OF SOCIETY AMONG THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HIS LOT WAS CAST IN THESE IMPORTANT YEARS
FROM THE STATE OF MY OWN RESIDENCE BESIDES OTHER WORTHY BUT LESS-KNOWN WHIG NAMES WE SENT MARSHALL MORRISON BAKER AND HARDIN
WHEN THE MEXICAN WAR BROKE OUT HE ASKED FOR A COMMISSION AS BRIGADIER-GENERAL ALTHOUGH HE STILL HELD HIS CIVIL APPOINTMENT AND TO THE AMAZEMENT OF THE WHOLE ARMY HE WAS GIVEN THAT IMPORTANT COMMAND BEFORE HE HAD EVER SEEN A DAY'S SERVICE
ALL MENTION OF THIS WAS AVOIDED IN THE INSTRUMENT AND IT WAS EXPRESSLY STATED THAT THE STATE WAS TO BE FORMED SUBJECT TO THE ADJUSTMENT BY THIS GOVERNMENT OF ALL QUESTIONS OF BOUNDARY THAT MAY ARISE WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS BUT THE MOMENT THE RESOLUTIONS WERE PASSED THE GOVERNMENT ASSUMED AS A MATTER BEYOND DISPUTE THAT ALL OF THE TERRITORY EAST OF THE RIO GRANDE WAS THE RIGHTFUL PROPERTY OF TEXAS TO BE DEFENDED BY THE MILITARY POWER OF THE UNITED STATES
THE PLOTS OF TOWNS FOR A HUNDRED MILES AROUND WERE CARRIED THERE TO BE DISPOSED OF AT AUCTION
FRANCIS REFUSED TO ANNOUNCE HIM WITHOUT SEEING HIM AND NOW I SUPPOSE THERE IS TO BE A FUSS ABOUT IT
OF THE DOCUMENT ITSELF NO EXTENDED CRITICISM IS NECESSARY
228 311 ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE LATER CONTROVERSY ALREADY EXISTED

AT THE SAME TIME IT IS NOT TO BE DENIED THAT THERE WAS A TACIT UNDERSTANDING AMONG THE WHIGS OF THE DISTRICT THAT WHOEVER SHOULD AT EACH ELECTION GAIN THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING THE ONE WHIG CONSTITUENCY OF THE STATE SHOULD HOLD HIMSELF SATISFIED WITH THE PRIVILEGE AND NOT BE A CANDIDATE FOR REELECTION
THE BOGUS LAWS GOVERNOR REEDER'S CENSUS
CLAY AND WEBSTER EACH GAVE A SON NEVER TO BE RETURNED
IT WAS A SINCERE UNSOUGHT TRIBUTE OF HIS EQUALS TO THOSE PHYSICAL AND MORAL QUALITIES WHICH MADE HIM THE BEST MAN OF HIS HUNDRED AND AS SUCH WAS ACCEPTED AND PRIZED
AT THE SAME TIME HE CLEARLY INTIMATES THAT HE IS AT HER DISPOSITION IF SHE IS SO INCLINED
THE CONVENTION WAS BEATEN BY 1800 MAJORITY IN A TOTAL VOTE OF 11612 AND THE STATE SAVED FOREVER FROM SLAVERY
NICOLAY AND JOHN HAY VOLUME ONE TO THE HONORABLE ROBERT TODD LINCOLN THIS WORK IS DEDICATED IN TOKEN OF A LIFE-LONG FRIENDSHIP AND ESTEEM AUTHORS PREFACE A GENERATION BORN SINCE ABRAHAM LINCOLN DIED HAS ALREADY REACHED MANHOOD AND WOMANHOOD
THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN WAS CARRIED ON IN A TONE SOMEWHAT SHRILL
ON THE DAY BEFORE LINCOLN'S FIRST INAUGURATION AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE AUTOCRAT OF ALL THE RUSSIAS ALEXANDER II BY IMPERIAL DECREE EMANCIPATED HIS SERFS
BAKER HAD GONE WITH HIS REGIMENT TO MEXICO IT DID NOT HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY OF THE EARLIER ACTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN AND HIS FIERY SPIRIT CHAFED IN THE ENFORCED IDLENESS OF CAMP AND GARRISON
FOR YEARS THE LONG PROCESSIONS OF MOVERS WOUND OVER THOSE FERTILE AND NEGLECTED PLAINS TAKING NO HINT OF THE WEALTH SUGGESTED BY THE RANK LUXURIANCE OF VEGETABLE GROWTH AROUND THEM THE CARPET OF BRILLIANT FLOWERS SPREAD OVER THE VERDANT KNOLLS THE STRONG SUCCULENT GRASS THAT WAVED IN THE BREEZE FULL OF WARM AND VITAL ODOR AS HIGH AS THE WAIST OF A MAN
WITH THE HELP OF THE STRINGFELLOWS AND OTHER ZEALOUS CO-WORKERS THE TOWN OF ATCHISON WAS FOUNDED AND NAMED IN HIS HONOR AND THE SQUATTER SOVEREIGN NEWSPAPER ESTABLISHED WHICH DISPLAYED HIS NAME AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY
LOOKING ABOUT FOR A YOUNG MAN OF GOOD CHARACTER INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO LEARN SURVEYING AT SHORT NOTICE HIS ATTENTION WAS SOON ATTRACTED TO LINCOLN
THE ZEAL OF THE FOLLOWERS OF JACKSON ALTHOUGH HE HAD CEASED TO BE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN WHETTED BY HIS PUBLIC DENUNCIATIONS OF THE ANTISLAVERY PROPAGANDA
HIS GENEROSITY COURAGE AND CAPABILITY OF DISCERNING TWO SIDES TO A DISPUTE WERE REMARKABLE EVEN THEN AND WON HIM THE ADMIRATION OF THOSE TO WHOM SUCH QUALITIES WERE UNKNOWN
THIS WAS OF COURSE A CAUSE OF WAR AND THE YOUNG CLERK WAS FORCED TO FOLLOW THE INCENSED RUFFIAN INTO THE STREET WHERE THE COMBAT WAS OF SHORT DURATION
352 364 ILLUSTRATION
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE OPINIONS AND THOSE CONTAINED IN THE ABOVE RESOLUTIONS IS THEIR REASON FOR ENTERING THIS PROTEST
I ALWAYS WAS SUPERSTITIOUS
TO THIS DAY SOME OF THE SURVIVORS OF THAT PERIOD INSIST THAT IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF THE ALMIGHTY AND NOTHING LESS THAT THUS MANIFESTED ITSELF
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THEY STOOD ALOOF FROM THE CIVIL OFFICERS APPOINTED BY AND THROUGH THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE RECORDED NO TITLE PAPERS BEGAN NO LAWSUITS ABSTAINED FROM ELECTIONS AND DENIED THEMSELVES PRIVILEGES WHICH REQUIRED ANY OPEN RECOGNITION OF THE ALIEN MISSOURI STATUTES
THE EXASPERATION HAD BEEN TOO GREAT TO PERMIT A CONCENTRATION OR COMPROMISE ON ANY OF THE SENIORS CASS REACHED ONLY 131 VOTES
WHEN WE WERE THE POLITICAL SLAVES OF KING GEORGE AND WANTED TO BE FREE WE CALLED THE MAXIM THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL A SELF-EVIDENT TRUTH
HIS GREAT PHYSICAL STRENGTH
MR GREEN WAS A DEMOCRAT AND HAS LEANED TOWARDS THAT PARTY ALL HIS LIFE BUT WHAT HE THOUGHT AND THINKS OF LINCOLN CAN BE SEEN BY AN ENDORSEMENT ON THE BACK OF THE CERTIFICATE NAMED WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS PRESERVE THIS AS IT IS THE NOBLEST OF GOD'S CREATION--A
IN THE SENATE IT ENCOUNTERED MORE OPPOSITION AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN A CHAMBER WHICH HAD OVERWHELMINGLY REJECTED THE SAME SCHEME ONLY A FEW MONTHS BEFORE
SEVERAL ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE LOST HEAVILY BY PROPOSING THEM
A COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE FAILED TO AGREE
THOSE WHO WITNESSED HIS WONDERFUL FORBEARANCE AND SELF RESTRAINT IN LATER MANHOOD WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE HOW PROMPTLY AND WITH WHAT PLEASURE HE USED TO RESORT TO MEASURES OF REPRESSION AGAINST A BULLY OR BRAWLER
THE YOUNGER BOONE HAD MADE THAT LONG PILGRIMAGE THROUGH THE TRACKLESS WOODS LED BY AN INSTINCT OF DOGLIKE AFFECTION TO FIND HIS ELDER BROTHER AND SHARE HIS SYLVAN PLEASURES AND DANGERS
HE WAS A ROVING BACHELOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA DEVOTED TO THE CHASE WHO HAD BUILT THIS HUT THREE YEARS BEFORE ON THE MARGIN OF A GREEN-BORDERED RIVULET WHERE THE DEER PASSED BY IN HUNDREDS GOING IN THE MORNING FROM THE SHADY BANKS OF THE SANGAMON TO FEED ON THE RICH GREEN GRASS OF THE PRAIRIE AND RETURNING IN THE TWILIGHT
THERE WAS NO LACK OF CANDIDATES
LINCOLN HAD BEEN CHOSEN ONE OF THE MEMBERS FROM SANGAMON COUNTY BY SOME 650 MAJORITY

STUART ACHILLES MORRIS AND PETER CARTWRIGHT THE FIRST OF WHOM RECEIVED 1127 VOTES AND THE LAST 815
CAN YOU THERE ANY MORE THAN HERE RAISE CORN AND WHEAT AND OATS WITHOUT WORK
WHEN ASKED BY THE COUNSEL TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS THEY WOULD SAY WHY GENTLEMEN THE JURY UNDERSTAND THIS CASE AS WELL AS YOU OR I
THE BUFFALO BOONE SAYS WERE MORE FREQUENT THAN I HAVE SEEN CATTLE IN THE SETTLEMENTS BROWSING ON THE LEAVES OF THE CANE OR CROPPING THE HERBAGE ON THESE EXTENSIVE PLAINS FEARLESS BECAUSE IGNORANT OF THE VIOLENCE OF MAN
THE LARGEST FEE HE EVER GOT WAS ONE OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILWAY AND HE HAD TO BRING SUIT TO COMPEL THEM TO PAY IT
FROM A PORTRAIT BY CHARLES B
I AM YOUNG AND UNKNOWN TO MANY OF YOU
FORTUNATELY FOR LINCOLN AND FOR THE WORLD THE ENTERPRISE WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL
BESIDES THOSE CITIZENS WHO CAME TO LISTEN AND JUDGE THERE WERE MANY WHOSE ONLY OBJECT WAS THE FREE WHISKY PROVIDED FOR THE OCCASION AND WHO AFTER POTATIONS POTTLE-DEEP BECAME NOT ONLY HIGHLY UNPARLIAMENTARY BUT EVEN DANGEROUS TO LIFE AND LIMB
TREAT WAS ANY LAPSE OF DIGNITY OR OF PROPRIETY POSSIBLE
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SLAVERY IN THIS NEW REGION HAD FORMED THE SUBJECT OF PUBLIC AND LOCAL DISCUSSION BEFORE THE NEBRASKA BILL AND SENATOR ATCHISON HAD PROMISED HIS WESTERN MISSOURI CONSTITUENTS TO LABOR FOR SUCH A RESULT
IF HE TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE BLUE HEAVEN IT WAS TO PROGNOSTICATE TOMORROW'S RAIN OR SUNSHINE
IT PLEASED THE GOVERNOR THEREFORE TO LISTEN TO THE PRAYERS OF STILLMAN'S BRAVES AND HE GAVE THEM ORDERS TO PROCEED TO THE HEAD OF OLD MAN'S CREEK WHERE IT WAS SUPPOSED THERE WERE SOME HOSTILE INDIANS AND COERCE THEM INTO SUBMISSION
BUT A FEW DAYS LATER THEY SAW TWO MEN APPROACHING AND HAILED THEM WITH THE HUNTER'S CAUTION HULLO STRANGERS
THIS WAS AN UNUSUAL PARTY PHENOMENON AND HAD ITS SHARE IN HASTENING THE GENERAL AGITATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE
HE SEEMED TO THE NEW SALEM PEOPLE TO BE LOAFING
THE ORDINANCE OF 1787
THE BIG SPRINGS RESOLUTIONS INDEED COUNSELED RESISTANCE TO A BLOODY ISSUE
IT CANNOT BE
LINCOLN WAS HIMSELF A GOOD CARPENTER WHEN HE CHOSE TO WORK AT HIS TRADE
IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FIND A COMPETENT AUTHORITY TO PERFORM THE CEREMONY
HIS TRIALS AND EMBARRASSMENTS PRESSED HIM DOWN TO A LOWER POINT THAN USUAL ILLUSTRATION
HE RAISED ENOUGH CORN TO SUPPORT LIFE
HE THOUGHT THAT CONGRESS HAD THE POWER UNDER THE CONSTITUTION TO REGULATE OR PROHIBIT SLAVERY IN ALL REGIONS UNDER ITS EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND HE THOUGHT IT PROPER TO EXERCISE THAT POWER WITH DUE REGARD TO VESTED RIGHTS AND THE GENERAL WELFARE
GENERAL ZACHARY TAYLOR HAD BEEN SENT DURING THE SUMMER TO CORPUS CHRISTI WHERE A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE SMALL ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS PLACED UNDER HIS COMMAND
OLD RESIDENTS SAY HE WAS THE BEST JUDGE AT A HORSE-RACE THE COUNTY AFFORDED
HIS POWER AND VALUE AS A LAWYER
FOR THE GREATER PART THESE IGNORANT BUT STUBBORN AND STRONG-WILLED FRONTIERSMEN WERE MOVED BY A BITTER HATRED OF ABOLITIONISM BECAUSE THE WORD HAD NOW BEEN USED FOR HALF A CENTURY BY PARTISANS HIGH AND LOW--GOVERNORS SENATORS PRESIDENTS--AS A TERM OF OPPROBRIUM AND A SYNONYM OF CRIME
BUT THESE INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OF PREJUDICE OR LIBERALITY WERE SUBMERGED AND LOST IN THE CURRENT OF POPULAR OPINION SPRINGING FROM PREVAILING INTERESTS IN THE RESPECTIVE LOCALITIES AND INSTITUTIONS MOLDED PRINCIPLES UNTIL IN TURN PRINCIPLES SHOULD BECOME STRONG ENOUGH TO REFORM INSTITUTIONS
MORDECAI AND JOSIAH BECAME REPUTABLE CITIZENS
LONG BEFORE NOVEMBER IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE POLITICAL REVOLUTION AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH WAS THOROUGH AND THAT ELECTION DAY WAS ANXIOUSLY AWAITED MERELY TO RECORD THE POPULAR VERDICT ALREADY DECIDED
A FEW OF US THIS MORNING HOWEVER CONCLUDED THAT AS YOU WERE ALREADY BEING ANNOUNCED IN THE PAPERS WE WOULD DELAY ANNOUNCING YOU AS BY YOUR AUTHORITY FOR A WEEK OR TWO
IT IS ALSO REPORTED THAT HE SOMETIMES IMPEDED THE CELERITY OF HARVEST OPERATIONS BY MAKING BURLESQUE SPEECHES OR WORSE THAN THAT COMIC SERMONS FROM THE TOP OF SOME TEMPTING STUMP TO THE DELIGHT OF THE HIRED HANDS AND THE EXASPERATION OF THE FARMER
AS THE RESULT OF THE LONG CONFLICT OF OPINION HITHERTO MAINTAINED THE BELIEFS AND DESIRES OF THE CONTENDING SECTIONS HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME FORMULATED IN DISTINCT POLITICAL DOCTRINES
3 LENGTHY FOOTNOTE RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END THOUGH IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE POST-OFFICE AND THE SURVEYOR'S COMPASS WERE NOT MAKING A RICH MAN OF HIM THEY WERE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE HIM TO LIVE DECENTLY AND DURING THE YEAR HE GREATLY INCREASED HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND HIS INFLUENCE IN THE COUNTY
IN 1769 HE MADE HIS MEMORABLE JOURNEY TO THAT VIRGIN WILDERNESS OF WHOSE BEAUTY HE ALWAYS LOVED TO SPEAK EVEN TO HIS LATEST BREATH
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A BODY SO HETEROGENEOUS TO PUT FORWARD A DISTINCTIVE PLATFORM OF PRINCIPLES
HIS WHOLE CAREER WAS TO RUN IN THE LINES MARKED OUT BY THESE WORDS WRITTEN IN THE HURRY OF A CLOSING SESSION AND HE WAS TO ACCOMPLISH FEW ACTS IN THAT GREAT HISTORY WHICH GOD RESERVED FOR HIM WISER AND NOBLER THAN THIS
THE AFFAIR WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE A MISUNDERSTANDING
SQUIRMING AND CRAWLING ABOUT FROM PLACE TO PLACE CAN DO NO GOOD
THIS DISAPPOINTS ME BECAUSE IT IS THE FIRST EFFORT OF THE KIND I HAVE KNOWN MADE BY ONE APPEARING TO ME TO BE INTELLIGENT RIGHT-MINDED AND IMPARTIAL HE THEN REVIEWS SOME OF THE STATEMENTS OF MR PECK PROVING THEIR INCORRECTNESS AND GOES ON TO SHOW THAT OUR ARMY HAD MARCHED UNDER ORDERS ACROSS THE DESERT OF THE NUECES INTO A PEACEFUL MEXICAN SETTLEMENT FRIGHTENING AWAY THE INHABITANTS
HE CONFIDENTLY EXPECTS TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY MANY OF HIS BRIGADE THE QUOTA ASSIGNED TO ILLINOIS WAS THREE REGIMENTS
NONE OF THE OTHERS SO FAR AS WE KNOW EVER MADE THEIR EXISTENCE KNOWN TO THEIR POWERFUL KINSMAN DURING THE YEARS OF HIS GLORY
I BELIEVE IT AS GOOD A BILL AS WE COULD GET AT THIS TIME AND AM WILLING TO PAY FOR SLAVES IN ORDER TO SAVE THEM FROM THE SOUTHERN MARKET AS I SUPPOSE EVERY MAN IN THE DISTRICT WOULD SELL HIS SLAVES IF HE SAW THAT SLAVERY WAS TO BE ABOLISHED MR LINCOLN THEREFORE MOVED ON THE 16TH OF JANUARY AS AN AMENDMENT TO GOTT'S PROPOSITION THAT THE COMMITTEE REPORT A BILL FOR THE TOTAL ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THE TERMS OF WHICH HE GAVE IN FULL
AS ALREADY SAID AFTER SOME FACTIOUS OPPOSITION THE MEASURES OF 1850 HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE AS A FINALITY OF THE SLAVERY QUESTION
MANY OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HAD SEEMINGLY OVERSHADOWING ADVANTAGES BY PROMINENCE AND TRAINING TO SEIZE AND APPROPRIATE THEM TO THEIR OWN ADVANCEMENT
HE SHARED IN THAT SANGUINE EPIDEMIC OF FINANCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL QUACKERY WHICH DEVASTATED THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND VOTED WITH THE BEST MEN OF THE COUNTRY IN FAVOR OF SCHEMES WHICH APPEARED THEN LIKE A PROMISE OF AN IMMEDIATE MILLENNIUM AND SEEM NOW LIKE MIDSUMMER MADNESS
HIS PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAD BEEN CURSORY AND SLIGHT AND STUART WAS THEN TOO MUCH ENGROSSED IN POLITICS TO PAY THE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO THE LAW WHICH THAT JEALOUS MISTRESS REQUIRES
LINCOLN WAS NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTOR AND THREW HIMSELF WITH ARDOR INTO THE CANVASS TRAVERSING A GREAT PART OF THE STATE AND SPEAKING WITH REMARKABLE EFFECT
THE PERILS AND ADVENTURES THROUGH WHICH THE YOUNG PIONEERS WENT TO OBTAIN THEIR BRIDES FURNISH FORTH THOUSANDS OF TALES BY WESTERN FIRESIDES

BUT GOING TO THE SENATE A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE SESSION IT LAPSED WITHOUT A VOTE

HAVING JUST RETURNED FROM A TRIP THROUGH VIRGINIA NORTH CAROLINA AND TENNESSEE PERMIT ME TO INFORM YOU THAT YOU WILL GET WHIPPED OUT OF YOUR BOOTS
AMONG THE FIRST PERSONS HE MET THERE--NOT IN THE LEGISLATURE PROPER BUT IN THE LOBBY WHERE HE WAS TRYING TO APPROPRIATE AN OFFICE THEN FILLED BY COLONEL JOHN J

BUT THE COOLNESS AND PRUDENCE OF GENERAL TAYLOR MADE FUTILE ANY SUCH HOPES IF THEY WERE ENTERTAINED AND IT REQUIRED A POSITIVE ORDER TO INDUCE HIM IN MARCH 1846 TO ADVANCE TOWARDS THE RIO GRANDE AND TO CROSS THE DISPUTED TERRITORY
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF JOHN HANKS HE PLOWED FIFTEEN ACRES AND SPLIT FROM THE TALL WALNUT-TREES OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST ENOUGH RAILS TO SURROUND THEM WITH A FENCE

BOTH WERE PAPER TOWNS--"COTTONWOOD TOWNS IN BORDER SLANG--OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS
CIVIL WAR OF WHICH FURTHER MENTION WILL BE MADE IN THE NEXT CHAPTER HAD NOW BEEN RAGING FOR MONTHS AND HAD IN ITS GENERAL RESULTS GONE AGAINST THE FREE-STATE MEN
WHERE OTHERS WERE CONTENT TO TAKE STATEMENTS AT SECOND HAND HE PREFERRED TO VERIFY CITATIONS AS WELL AS TO FIND NEW ONES
A PASSAGE FROM THE CLOSE OF A SPEECH MADE BY LINCOLN ON FEBRUARY 22 1842 SHOWS THE FERVOR AND FEELING OF THE HOUR
IT WAS IN THE TOWN OF LAWRENCE THAT THE FREE-STATE MOVEMENT NATURALLY FOUND ITS BEGINNING
WHEN IN 1763 THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY PASSED BY TREATY UNDER THE BRITISH FLAG THE OLD FRENCH COLONISTS WITH THEIR SLAVES ALMOST IN A BODY CROSSED THE MISSISSIPPI INTO THEN SPANISH TERRITORY AND WITH FRESH ADDITIONS FROM NEW ORLEANS FOUNDED ST LOUIS AND ITS OUTLYING SETTLEMENTS

FOR THIS IS A LESSON WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN LEARNED BY ANY LEGISLATURE IN THE WORLD
AS YET MANY OF THESE FRONTIER TOWNS WERE SMALL HAMLETS WITHOUT EVEN A PRETEXT OF POLICE REGULATIONS
THEIR FIRST STEP WAS TO RECOMMEND THE REPEAL OF ALL LAWS WHATSOEVER WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN IN FORCE IN THE TERRITORY ON THE 1ST DAY OF JULY 1855 THUS FOREVER QUIETING ANY DOUBT AS TO WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT LAW IN THIS TERRITORY
FOR FIVE YEARS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO HIS WORK WITH MORE ENERGY AND MORE SUCCESS THAN EVER BEFORE
THE MAILS WERE SO SCANTY THAT HE WAS SAID TO CARRY THEM IN HIS HAT AND HE IS ALSO REPORTED TO HAVE READ EVERY NEWSPAPER THAT ARRIVED
HE HAD COME TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD BEEN FOULLY WRONGED BY THE TREATY WHICH WAS HIS OWN ACT
CARELESS LISTENERS WHO CAME TO LAUGH AT HIS JOKES WERE HELD BY THE STRONG CURRENT OF HIS REASONING AND THE FLASHES OF HIS EARNEST ELOQUENCE AND WERE LIFTED UP BY THE RANGE AND TENOR OF HIS ARGUMENT INTO A FRESHER AND PURER POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE
HE URGED UPON HIS WHIG FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS TO DROP HIS OWN NAME AND JOIN WITHOUT HESITATION OR CONDITIONS IN THE ELECTION OF TRUMBULL
INSTEAD OF TAKING THE ROSY DAUGHTER OF A NEIGHBOR THE ENTERPRISING BACHELOR WOULD OFTEN GO BACK TO KENTUCKY AND PASS THROUGH AS MANY ADVENTURES IN BRINGING HIS WIFE HOME AS A RETURNING CRUSADER WOULD MEET BETWEEN BEIRUT AND VIENNA
THAT FAVORED REGION QUICKLY DROVE ALL COMPETITORS OUT OF THE MARKET
DEMOCRATS 159 A CLEAR DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY OF 84

THOUGH THE FRIENDLIEST AND MOST JOVIAL OF GOSSIPS HE WAS NOT INSENSIBLE TO AFFRONTS
SHERIFF JONES MADE SEVERAL VISITS UNMOLESTED ON THEIR PART AND WITHOUT ANY DISPLAY OF WRITS OR DEMAND FOR THE SURRENDER OF ALLEGED OFFENDERS ON HIS OWN
TO THIS HE ADDED AN ADROITNESS IN EVASION AND FALSE LOGIC PERHAPS NEVER EQUALED AND IN HIS DEFENSE OF THE NEBRASKA MEASURE THIS QUESTIONABLE BUT CONVENIENT GIFT WAS EVER HIS MAIN RELIANCE
THE DOMESTIC SLAVE-TRADE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WAS ABOLISHED
CONGRESS WAS IRRECONCILABLY DIVIDED IN POLITICS
IT PROVIDED FOR THE ISSUE OF BONDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST DUE BY THE STATE AND FOR THE APPROPRIATION OF A SPECIAL PORTION OF STATE TAXES TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS THUS INCURRED
BUT IN THIS CASE IT WAS URGED AS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENABLE THE COMMITTEE TO MAKE THEIR REPORT THE NEXT DAY
HE WAS AN EASY-GOING MAN ENTIRELY WITHOUT AMBITION BUT NOT WITHOUT SELF-RESPECT
IT WAS USELESS FOR THE WHIGS TO TRY TO PREVENT THIS DEGRADATION OF THE BENCH
BUT THE TIME WAS PASSED FOR HONORABLE ALLIANCES AMONG THE INDIANS

GAINES AND HIS DETACHMENT HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN COMPELLING THE INDIANS TO RE CROSS THE MISSISSIPPI AND TO ENTER INTO A SOLEMN TREATY ON THE 30TH OF JUNE BY WHICH THE FORMER TREATIES WERE RATIFIED AND BLACK HAWK AND HIS LEADING WARRIORS BOUND THEMSELVES NEVER AGAIN TO SET FOOT ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE RIVER WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION FROM THE PRESIDENT OR THE GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS

BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT HE FELT TOO LARGE FOR THE LIFE OF A FARMHAND ON PIGEON CREEK AND HIS THOUGHTS NATURALLY TURNED AFTER THE MANNER OF RESTLESS BOYS IN THE WEST TO THE RIVER AS THE AVENUE OF ESCAPE FROM THE NARROW LIFE OF THE WOODS
THE BLOW HAS ALREADY FALLEN
IT WILL GREATLY INCREASE THE EXPENSE OF OUR COURTS OR ELSE GREATLY DIMINISH THEIR UTILITY
LINCOLN WAS A MEMBER OF THIS BODY AND BEING BY THAT TIME THE UNQUESTIONED LEADER OF THE WHIG MINORITY WAS NOMINATED FOR SPEAKER AND CAME WITHIN ONE VOTE OF AN ELECTION
UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THIS SOCIETY A PIONEER COMPANY OF ABOUT THIRTY PERSONS ARRIVED IN KANSAS IN JULY 1854 AND FOUNDED THE TOWN OF LAWRENCE
ONE WHO OFTEN VISITED HIM WRITES REFERRING TO THE OLD-FASHIONED HOSPITALITY OF SPRINGFIELD AMONG OTHERS I RECALL WITH A SAD PLEASURE THE DINNERS AND EVENING PARTIES GIVEN BY MRS LINCOLN
WE CAME FROM ILLINOIS TO WASHINGTON WITH HIM AND REMAINED AT HIS SIDE AND IN HIS SERVICE SEPARATELY OR TOGETHER--UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
THERE ARE OF COURSE FOOLISH STORIES EXTANT THAT ABRAHAM USED TO BOAST AND THAT OTHERS USED TO PREDICT THAT HE WOULD BE PRESIDENT SOME DAY
THEY DID NOT DARE TO IGNORE UPON WHAT A RIDICULOUSLY SHADOWY PRETEXT THE BRANSON PEACE-WARRANT HAD GROWN INTO AN ARMY OF TWO THOUSAND MEN AND HOW UNDER THE MANIPULATION OF SHERIFF JONES A QUESTIONABLE AFFIDAVIT OF A PRO-SLAVERY CRIMINAL HAD BEEN EXPANDED INTO THE CASUS BELLI OF A FREE-STATE TOWN
EACH STATE LARGE OR SMALL WAS ALLOWED TWO SENATORS
WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON THE BOLDEST AND MOST AGGRESSIVE NON RESISTANT THAT EVER LIVED HAD SINCE 1831 BEEN POURING FORTH ONCE A WEEK IN THE LIBERATOR HIS EARNEST AND ELOQUENT DENUNCIATIONS OF SLAVERY TAKING NO ACCOUNT OF THE EXPEDIENT OR THE POSSIBLE BUT DEMANDING WITH ALL THE FERVOR OF AN ANCIENT PROPHET THE IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF THE CAUSE OF OFFENSE
SO FAR AS HISTORY HAS BEEN ALLOWED A GLIMPSE INTO THESE SECRET COMMUNINGS THREE PRINCIPAL PERSONAGES WERE AT THIS TIME PLANNING A MOVEMENT OF VAST PORTENT
WITH NEARLY FIFTEEN MILLION ACRES OF FRESH LAND TO CHOOSE FROM FOR THE PRESENT OUTLAY OF A TRIFLING PREEMPTION FEE SHOULD NOT THE POOR WHITE COMPEL HIS SINGLE BLACK BOY TO FOLLOW HIM A FEW MILES WEST AND HOE HIS TOBACCO FOR HIM ON THE NEW FAT BOTTOM-LANDS OF THE KAW RIVER
WE ARE SURE THAT LINCOLN WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO BANISH IT EVEN FROM HIS MEMORY
AND I FEAR TO THINK OTHERWISE IS TO BE DECEIVED

BUT HE WAS SOON BROUGHT TO REASON BY HIS ELEVEN COLLEAGUES MAKING PREPARATIONS TO HANG HIM TO THE RAFTERS OF THE JURY ROOM
THE MEN OF CULTIVATION WIELDED AN INFLUENCE IN THE LEGISLATURE ENTIRELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THEIR NUMBERS AS THE RUDER SORT OF PIONEERS WERE NATURALLY IN A LARGE MAJORITY

SO THAT ALTHOUGH THE SETTLEMENTS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE ARE FROM TWENTY TO FIFTY YEARS IN ADVANCE ON THE SCORE OF AGE YET ARE THEY TEN YEARS BEHIND IN POINT OF WEALTH AND ALL THE APPLIANCES OF A HIGHER CIVILIZATION SIDENOTE

AND THE NAMES OF CASS AND MARCY BUCHANAN AND BUTLER WERE FREELY MIXED IN WITH SUCH EPITHETS AS PRETENDERS HUCKSTERS INTRUDERS AND VILE CHARLATANS SUCH CHARACTERIZATION OF SUCH MEN SOON CREATED A FLAGRANT SCANDAL IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH WAS DULY AIRED BOTH IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND IN CONGRESS
THE ELECTION IN MISSOURI WAS HELD IN AUGUST AND BENTON WAS EASILY BEATEN BY A WHIG WHO WAS AS FIERCE FOR REPEAL AS DOUGLAS HIMSELF
BUT I BECAME SATISFIED THAT IF WE COULD PREVENT MATTESON'S ELECTION ONE OR TWO BALLOTS MORE WE COULD NOT POSSIBLY DO SO A SINGLE BALLOT AFTER MY FRIENDS SHOULD BEGIN TO RETURN TO ME FROM TRUMBULL
THE LEADING MEN WHO ORGANIZED THAT PARTY WERE PRESENT ON THE 4TH OF OCTOBER AT THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN DOUGLAS AND MYSELF AT SPRINGFIELD AND HAD FULL OPPORTUNITY TO NOT MISUNDERSTAND MY POSITION
JUDGE DAVIS SAYS
I HAVE THE HONOR TO INFORM YOU THAT I TOO HAVE BEEN ALL MY LIFE INDUSTRIOUS AND FRUGAL AND THAT THE FRUITS THEREOF ARE MAINLY INVESTED IN SLAVES OF WHOM I OWN THREE HUNDRED
104-5 IT WAS NOT TILL FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE INVENTION OF THE COTTON-GIN THAT THE AFRICAN SLAVE-TRADE CEASED BY LIMITATION OF LAW
THE EXAMPLE OF JUDGE LOGAN'S THRIFT ORDER AND SEVERITY OF MORALS
THESE WERE THE PRINCIPAL POINTS OF DIFFERENCE WHICH CAUSED THE GREAT SLAVERY AGITATION OF 1850
BUT SINCE THE DEED HAS BEEN DONE THEY ARE FAST FALLING IN AND IN MY OPINION WE SHALL HAVE A MOST OVERWHELMING GLORIOUS TRIUMPH

GENERAL CASS HAD BEEN NOMINATED FOR THE PRESIDENCY BUT HIS MILITIA TITLE HAD NO GLAMOUR OF CARNAGE ABOUT IT AND THE SECESSION OF THE NEW YORK ANTI-SLAVERY BARNBURNERS FROM THE CONVENTION WAS A PRESAGE OF DISASTER WHICH WAS FULFILLED IN THE FOLLOWING AUGUST BY THE ASSEMBLING OF THE RECUSANT DELEGATES AT BUFFALO WHERE THEY WERE JOINED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF DISCONTENTED DEMOCRATS AND LIBERTY MEN AND THE FREE-SOIL PARTY WAS ORGANIZED FOR ITS SHORT BUT EFFECTIVE MISSION
A CASE WAS MADE UP FOR DECISION AND DECIDED ADVERSELY TO THE ALIENS WHO APPEALED IT TO THE SUPREME COURT
HERNDON'S SPEECH AT OLD SETTLERS MEETING MENARD COUNTY SIDENOTE

OF THE ELECTORS TAYLOR HAD 163 AND CASS 137
THE PARTY WENT UP THE RIVER IN THE EARLY SUMMER AND SEPARATED IN ST LOUIS
MANY A MAN ARRIVING FROM AN OLD COMMUNITY AND IMPERFECTLY APPRECIATING THE NECESSITIES OF PIONEER LIFE HAS FOUND SUDDENLY ON THE APPROACH OF WINTER THAT HE MUST LEARN TO MAKE SHOES OR GO BAREFOOT
HE WAS CARRIED IN TRIUMPH TO WASHINGTON AND PRESENTED TO PRESIDENT JACKSON TO WHOM HE MADE THIS STERN AND DEFIANT SPEECH SHOWING HOW LITTLE AGE OR DISASTER COULD DO TO TAME HIS INDOMITABLE SPIRIT
HE FLATTERED THE TROOPS IN THE FIELD AND PAID A TOUCHING TRIBUTE TO THOSE WHO HAD DIED OF DISEASE AND EXPOSURE WITHOUT EVER ENJOYING THE SIGHT OF A BATTLE-FIELD AND RISING TO LYRIC ENTHUSIASM HE REPEATED A POEM OF HIS OWN WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN IN CAMP TO THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD OF THE FOURTH ILLINOIS
SHE TOO NOT ONLY HAD HER CHARTERED FERRY-BOAT BUT KEPT HER POLLS OPEN FOR THREE DAYS IN SUCCESSION AND NOT UNTIL HER BOXES CONTAINED NINE HUNDRED BALLOTS OF WHICH PROBABLY ONLY FIFTY WERE LEGAL DID THE STEAM WHISTLE SCREAM VICTORY
WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF ITS DEFENSIVE POSITION LAWRENCE WAS AS STRONG AS THE SHERIFF'S MOB
BUT IN THIS BOOK WE HAVE KNOWN NO ALLEGIANCE BUT TO THE TRUTH
IN THE DAYS OF THE BLACK HAWK WAR I FOUGHT BLED AND CAME AWAY
IN THE AUTUMN OF THAT SAME YEAR AN ELECTION FOR COUNTY-SEAT TOOK PLACE IN LEAVENWORTH COUNTY BY THE ACCIDENTAL FAILURE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DESIGNATE ONE
COLONEL DONIPHAN TOO THE FAVORITE WHIG OF MISSOURI AND WHO OVERRAN ALL NORTHERN MEXICO ON HIS RETURN HOME IN A PUBLIC SPEECH AT ST LOUIS CONDEMNED THE ADMINISTRATION IN RELATION TO THE WAR IF I REMEMBER
THE TOPEKA CONSTITUTION WAS NEVER RECEIVED NOR LEGALIZED
HE NEVER--SO FAR AS WE CAN LEARN--ALLUDED TO IT AFTERWARDS AND THE RECOLLECTION OF IT DIED AWAY SO COMPLETELY FROM THE MINDS OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE THAT DURING THE HEATED CANVASS OF 1860 THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THIS DISAGREEABLE EPISODE IN THE OPPOSITION PAPERS OF ILLINOIS
THE CAUCUS AGREEMENT OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE
THE SNOWFALL BEGAN IN THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS AND CONTINUED UNTIL THE SNOW WAS THREE FEET DEEP ON LEVEL GROUND
HIS REVERENCE FOR WOMEN WAS SO DEEP AND TENDER THAT HE THOUGHT AN INJURY TO ONE OF THEM WAS A SIN TOO HEINOUS TO BE EXPIATED
THIRD WHETHER THAT SPOT IS OR IS NOT WITHIN A SETTLEMENT OF PEOPLE WHICH SETTLEMENT HAS EXISTED EVER SINCE LONG BEFORE THE TEXAS REVOLUTION AND UNTIL ITS INHABITANTS FLED BEFORE THE APPROACH OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY
AND WHAT I PROPOSE IS THAT YOU SHALL GO TO WORK TOOTH AND NAIL FOR SOMEBODY WHO WILL GIVE YOU MONEY FOR IT
EX-VICE-PRESIDENT ATCHISON CAME IN PERSON LEADING A BATTALION OF TWO HUNDRED PLATTE COUNTY RIFLEMEN
THE TALISMAN MET THE NATURAL FATE OF STEAMBOATS A FEW MONTHS LATER BEING BURNED AT THE ST LOUIS WHARF
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OF OPINION THAT THE FIRST GREAT ERROR COMMITTED IN THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY WAS THE ORDINANCE OF 1787 RENDERING THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORY FREE TERRITORY
ONLY ONE OF THE SPEECHES HE MADE DURING THE YEAR HAS BEEN PRESERVED ENTIRE
BE SURE TO SEND ME AS MANY COPIES OF THE LIFE OF HARRISON AS YOU CAN SPARE
HE MODESTLY DISCLAIMED HIS HOSTESS'S EXTRAVAGANT PRAISES AND TOLD HIS VISITORS THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN EITHER COTTON OR COTTON SEED IN HIS LIFE
HE WAS TOO LOYAL A PARTISAN TO ACCEPT THEIR OVERTURES WITHOUT TAKING COUNSEL FROM THE WHIG CANDIDATES
GOVERNOR REEDER HAD COME TO KANSAS AN ARDENT DEMOCRAT A FIRM FRIEND OF THE PIERCE ADMINISTRATION AND AN ENTHUSIASTIC DISCIPLE OF THE NEW DEMOCRATIC DOGMA OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY BUT HIS SHORT EXPERIENCE WITH ATCHISON'S BORDER RUFFIANS HAD ALREADY RUDELY SHAKEN HIS PARTISANSHIP
BUTLER AT ONCE ACCEPTED AND WITH A GRIM SINCERITY ANNOUNCED HIS CONDITIONS--"TO FIGHT NEXT MORNING AT SUNRISING IN BOB ALLEN'S MEADOW ONE HUNDRED YARDS DISTANCE WITH RIFLES THIS WAS INSTANTLY DECLINED WITH A SORT OF HORROR BY SHIELDS AND WHITESIDES AS SUCH A PROCEEDING WOULD HAVE PROVED FATAL TO THEIR OFFICIAL POSITIONS AND THEIR MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD

THIS BILL WAS NOT THEREFORE AS HAS BEEN IMPROPERLY ASSERTED A MEASURE INSPIRED BY MR PIERCE OR ANY OF HIS CABINET."--DAVIS RISE AND FALL OF THE CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT VOL
WE HAD PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE AND DAILY OFFICIAL INTERCOURSE WITH CABINET OFFICERS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS GOVERNORS AND MILITARY AND NAVAL OFFICERS OF ALL GRADES WHOSE AFFAIRS BROUGHT THEM TO THE WHITE HOUSE
HE SPOKE ABOUT AN HOUR AND MADE A POWERFUL AND CONVINCING SPEECH WHICH WAS CHEERED TO THE ECHO MR ROBERT C
MARKING AS IT DOES WITH UNMISTAKABLE PRECISION A STEP IN THE SECOND PERIOD OF HIS INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT IT DESERVES THE CAREFUL ATTENTION OF THE STUDENT OF HIS LIFE
IT OBTRUDED ITSELF INTO ALL MANNER OF QUESTIONS AND CLUNG OBSTINATELY TO NUMBERLESS RESOLUTIONS AND BILLS
HE HAS FULFILLED THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS FRIENDS AND DISAPPOINTED THE HOPES OF HIS ENEMIES
LIKE OTHER POLITICIANS OF THE TIME HE USED ALL PROPER MEANS TO ATTAIN HIS OBJECT
A FEW DAYS AFTER CONGRESS OPENED MR ROOT OF OHIO INTRODUCED A RESOLUTION INSTRUCTING THE COMMITTEE ON TERRITORIES TO BRING IN A BILL WITH AS LITTLE DELAY AS PRACTICABLE TO PROVIDE TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS FOR CALIFORNIA AND NEW MEXICO WHICH SHOULD EXCLUDE SLAVERY THERE-FROM THIS RESOLUTION WOULD HAVE THROWN THE SAME HOUSE INTO A PANIC TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE BUT NOW IT PASSED BY A VOTE OF 108 TO 80--IN THE FORMER NUMBER WERE ALL THE WHIGS FROM THE NORTH AND ALL THE DEMOCRATS BUT EIGHT AND IN THE LATTER THE ENTIRE SOUTH AND THE EIGHT REFERRED TO
I CAN SET A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD AT LOGGERHEADS
EDWARDS NOW OCCUPIED AS ST
HE SIMPLY ADVISES THE GOVERNMENT IN CASE A VACANCY OCCURS WHO IN HIS OPINION IS THE BEST MAN TO FILL IT
AS THE ALIENS WERE NEARLY ALL DEMOCRATS THAT PARTY INSISTED ON THEIR VOTING AND THE WHIGS OBJECTED
OFFUTT'S BOAT HAD COME TO SERIOUS EMBARRASSMENT ON RUTLEDGE'S MILL-DAM AND THE UNWONTED INCIDENT BROUGHT THE ENTIRE POPULATION TO THE WATER'S EDGE
HIS CARE OF HIS FAMILY
THEY SOON CAME IN SIGHT OF THE OTHERS BUT LOITERED IN THE REAR UNTIL EVENING AND THEN DROVE RAPIDLY TO TREMONT ARRIVING THERE SOME TIME IN ADVANCE OF SHIELDS
NEARLY ALL OF KANSAS ATTAINABLE BY THE USUAL WATER TRANSPORTATION AND TRAVEL LAY IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE
WHEN YOU RESIDE IN ONE DAY'S JOURNEY OF THE TERRITORY SAID HE AND WHEN YOUR PEACE YOUR QUIET AND YOUR PROPERTY DEPEND UPON YOUR ACTION YOU CAN WITHOUT AN EXERTION SEND FIVE HUNDRED OF YOUR YOUNG MEN WHO WILL VOTE IN FAVOR OF YOUR INSTITUTIONS
KIDD IN THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL ALBUM HIS POWER OF COMPARISON WAS LARGE AND HE RARELY FAILED IN A LEGAL DISCUSSION TO USE THAT MODE OF REASONING
I THOUGHT SAYS THE GOVERNOR IN HIS MEMOIRS THEY MIGHT DISCOVER THE ENEMY ILLUSTRATION
AN EARLY SCHOOLMASTER SAYS THAT THE FIRST PLACE WHERE HE WENT TO BOARD WAS THE HOUSE OF ONE LUCAS CONSISTING OF A SINGLE ROOM SIXTEEN FEET SQUARE AND TENANTED BY MR AND MRS LUCAS TEN CHILDREN THREE DOGS TWO CATS AND HIMSELF
A FEW PASSAGES AT ARMS OF THIS SORT GAVE ABRAHAM A REDOUBTABLE REPUTATION IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THE TOWN WAS BUILT ON THE EDGE OF THE WOODS THE NORTH SIDE TOUCHING THE TIMBER THE SOUTH ENCROACHING ON THE PRAIRIE
DURING THE LONG COLONIAL PERIOD THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT FOSTERED AND FORCED THE IMPORTATION OF SLAVES TO AMERICA EQUALLY WITH ENGLISH GOODS
BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH ITS FORCES WERE RECRUITED MAINLY FROM THE WHIG PARTY THOUGH MALCONTENTS FROM ALL QUARTERS RUSHED TO GROUP THEMSELVES UPON ITS NARROW PLATFORM AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EXCITING BUT DELUSIVE TRIUMPHS OF ITS TEMPORARY AND LOCAL ASCENDENCY
175 THUS THE MATTER RESTED TILL THE 16TH OF JANUARY WHEN SENATOR DIXON OF KENTUCKY APPARENTLY ACTING FOR HIMSELF ALONE OFFERED AN AMENDMENT IN EFFECT REPEALING THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE
IT SEEMED FOR A MOMENT THAT THE FIGHT MUST TAKE PLACE
BUT THERE WAS THAT ABOUT HIM EVEN AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN YEARS WHICH MIGHT WELL JUSTIFY HIS ADMIRING FRIENDS IN PRESAGING FOR HIM AN UNUSUAL CAREER
CLAY HAD DIED TWO YEARS BEFORE AND DOUGLAS MADE SKILLFUL QUOTATIONS FROM THE GREAT STATESMAN'S SPEECHES TO BOLSTER UP HIS NEW PROPAGANDISM
THE AUDIENCES WERE COMPOSED OF LEADING MEN FROM NEARLY ALL THE COUNTIES OF THE STATE
LOGAN'S OFFICE WAS IN FACT A NURSERY OF STATESMEN
MEN WERE FOR OR AGAINST THE BILL--EVERY OTHER POLITICAL SUBJECT WAS LEFT IN ABEYANCE
THE ORGANIZATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN ILLINOIS REALLY TAKES ITS RISE FROM THIS TIME AND IN GREAT MEASURE FROM THE WORK OF MR PECK WITH THE VANDALIA LEGISLATURE
253 THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE ADJOURNED LATE ON THE NIGHT OF THE 30TH OF AUGUST 1855
THE DISCUSSION BEGAN WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM AND WITH CROWDED HOUSES BUT BY THE TIME IT CAME TO LINCOLN'S DUTY TO CLOSE THE DEBATE THE FICKLE PUBLIC HAD TIRED OF THE INTELLECTUAL JOUSTS AND HE SPOKE TO A COMPARATIVELY THIN HOUSE
WHEN CASUALLY ABSENT THE SPIRITS OF BOTH BAR AND PEOPLE WERE DEPRESSED
EARLY IN THE SESSION A JOINT RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR ANNEXATION WAS INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WHICH AFTER CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION AND ATTEMPTED AMENDMENT BY THE ANTI-SLAVERY MEMBERS PASSED THE HOUSE BY A MAJORITY OF TWENTY-TWO VOTES
IF THERE WERE DEMAGOGUES HERE AND THERE AMONG THEM SEEKING MERELY TO CREATE A BALANCE OF POWER FOR BARGAIN AND SALE THEY WERE UNIMPORTANT IN NUMBER AND ONLY OF LOCAL INFLUENCE AND SOON BECAME DESERTERS
SURVEYS FOR OTHER RAILROADS WERE ALSO PROPOSED TO CROSS THE STATE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
BUT IN REALITY WE GAVE THE VOTE TO LINCOLN BECAUSE WE LIKED HIM BECAUSE WE WANTED TO OBLIGE OUR FRIEND AND BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZED HIM AS OUR LEADER TO DO THIS THEY WERE OBLIGED TO QUARREL WITH THEIR MOST INTIMATE ASSOCIATES WHO HAD BOUGHT A PIECE OF WASTE LAND AT THE EXACT GEOGRAPHICAL CENTER OF THE STATE AND WERE STRIVING TO HAVE THE CAPITAL ESTABLISHED THERE IN THE INTEREST OF THEIR OWN POCKETS AND TERRITORIAL SYMMETRY
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES IN THE WEST BEARING HISTORIC NAMES AND PROBABLY DESCENDED FROM WELL-KNOWN HOUSES IN THE OLDER STATES OR IN ENGLAND WHICH BY PASSING THROUGH ONE OR TWO GENERATIONS OF ANCESTORS WHO COULD NOT READ OR WRITE HAVE LOST THEIR CONTINUITY WITH THE PAST AS EFFECTUALLY AS IF A DELUGE HAD INTERVENED BETWEEN THE LAST CENTURY AND THIS
THE JUDGES WERE LESS HAMPERED BY THE LIMITATIONS OF THEIR LEGAL LORE THAN BY THEIR FEARS OF A LOSS OF POPULARITY AS A RESULT OF TOO DEFINITE CHARGES IN CIVIL SUITS OR TOO GREAT SEVERITY IN CRIMINAL CASES
THE TREATY WAS ACCEPTED THOUGH THE GOVERNOR CONFESSED THERE WAS A SILENT DISSATISFACTION AT THE RESULT
I WILL DO IT HE SPOKE IN THE MOST EARNEST AND TOUCHING MANNER AND I CONFESS THAT I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED
THE RICH SOIL AND EQUABLE CLIMATE WERE NOW ATTRACTING AN EXCELLENT CLASS OF SETTLERS FROM THE OLDER STATES AND THE LONG-NEGLECTED NORTHERN COUNTIES WERE RECEIVING THE ATTENTION THEY DESERVED
1837 ON THE 3RD OF MARCH THE DAY BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE ADJOURNED MR LINCOLN CAUSED TO BE ENTERED UPON ITS RECORDS A PAPER WHICH EXCITED BUT LITTLE INTEREST AT THE TIME BUT WHICH WILL PROBABLY BE REMEMBERED LONG AFTER THE GOOD AND EVIL ACTIONS OF THE VANDALIA ASSEMBLY HAVE FADED AWAY FROM THE MINDS OF MEN
BUT THEY SERVED AS A TEXT FOR THE SPEECH WHICH LINCOLN MADE IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE WHICH DESERVES THE ATTENTIVE READING OF ANY ONE WHO IMAGINES THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING ACCIDENTAL IN THE ASCENDENCY WHICH HE HELD FOR TWENTY YEARS AMONG THE PUBLIC MEN OF ILLINOIS
LEAVENWORTH CITY ASPIRED TO THIS HONOR AND POLLED SIX HUNDRED VOTES
IN HER MODEST AND SIMPLE HOME WHERE EVERYTHING WAS SO ORDERLY AND REFINED THERE WAS ALWAYS ON THE PART OF BOTH HOST AND HOSTESS A CORDIAL AND HEARTY WESTERN WELCOME WHICH PUT EVERY GUEST PERFECTLY AT EASE
HER SISTERS WERE BETTY POLLY AND NANCY WHO MARRIED THOMAS SPARROW JESSE FRIEND AND LEVI HALL
FORTUNATELY THE SAME QUALITIES THAT OCCASION THE CONFLICT INSURE THE VICTORY ALSO
NOT ONLY WAS THIS TERRITORIAL BILL SEARCHINGLY CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE BUT REPEATED CAUCUSES WERE HELD BY THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERS TO DISCUSS THE PARTY RESULTS LIKELY TO GROW OUT OF IT
THEIR CLOSE RELATIONS CONTINUED FOR MANY YEARS AFTER AND WERE CEMENTED BY FREQUENT INTERMARRIAGE
THEY ALL SERVED WITH MORE OR LESS DISTINCTION BUT FOR EIGHT YEARS NO ONE WAS EVER TWICE A CANDIDATE
OUT OF THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE TIMES ALSO GREW THE STREET DISCUSSIONS I HAVE ADVERTED TO
A NUMBER OF CANDIDATES WERE PUT IN NOMINATION BUT THE CONTEST NARROWED ITSELF DOWN TO THREE
BUT A NARROW SPIRIT OF INTOLERANCE EXTENDING EVEN DOWN TO THE REBELLION KEPT ON THE STATUTE BOOKS A SERIES OF ACTS PROHIBITING THE SETTLEMENT OF FREE BLACKS IN THE STATE
THUS HARMONY WOULD BE PRESERVED AND PARTY POWER PROLONGED
AND THIS THEY ACCOMPLISHED IN THE FACE OF A SAVAGE FOE SURROUNDING THEIR FEEBLE SETTLEMENTS ALWAYS ALERT AND HOSTILE INVISIBLE AND DREADFUL AS THE VISIONARY POWERS OF THE AIR
THEIR ORATORY WAS SUITED TO THEIR LONGITUDE AND WAS PRINCIPALLY ADDRESSED TO THE EMOTIONS OF THEIR HEARERS
JESSE HEAD IN MAKING HIS REPORT WROTE THE DATE BEFORE THE NAMES
THESE DISCUSSIONS USED OFTEN TO BE HELD IN THE COURT-ROOM JUST UNDER OUR OFFICE AND THROUGH A TRAP-DOOR MADE THERE WHEN THE BUILDING WAS USED FOR A STORE-HOUSE WE COULD HEAR EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID IN THE HALL BELOW
IT HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF MUCH PROFANE AND IDLE DISCUSSION AMONG THOSE WHO WERE CONSTITUTIONALLY INCAPACITATED FROM APPRECIATING IDEAL SUFFERINGS AND WE WOULD BE TEMPTED TO REFRAIN FROM ADDING A WORD TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO OMIT ALL REFERENCE TO AN EXPERIENCE SO IMPORTANT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS CHARACTER
AND SEVERAL OTHER COUNTIES FOR REASONS NOT WORTH CONSIDERING WERE PLEDGED TO SUPPORT ANY ONE WHOM MORGAN COUNTY PRESENTED
HE ENTERED SEVERAL LARGE TRACTS OF FERTILE LAND AND RETURNING TO VIRGINIA DISPOSED OF HIS PROPERTY THERE AND WITH HIS WIFE AND FIVE CHILDREN WENT BACK TO KENTUCKY AND SETTLED IN JEFFERSON COUNTY

THIS WAS ONLY A TEMPORARY ARRANGEMENT BUT WHEN A YEAR OR TWO LATER THE TIME CAME TO FIX UPON A PERMANENT SEAT OF JUSTICE FOR THE COUNTY THE RESOURCES OF THE SPRING CREEK MEN WERE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY
SINGLE FEED 121/2
MEANTIME THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY EARNESTLY DENYING ANY WRONGFUL ACT OR PURPOSE SENT AN URGENT APPEAL FOR PROTECTION TO THE COMMANDER OF THE UNITED STATES FORCES AT FORT LEAVENWORTH ANOTHER TO CONGRESS AND A THIRD TO PRESIDENT PIERCE
SURVEYOR AND REPRESENTATIVE LINCOLN'S CANDIDACY FOR THE LEGISLATURE
IN ONE INSTANCE HE SENDS FORWARD THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE MAN WHOM HE DOES NOT PREFER WITH AN INDORSEMENT EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THEM AND ADDING
HE HAD EVEN CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT LAND CANNOT BE SOLD A PROPOSITION IN POLITICAL ECONOMY WHICH OUR MODERN SOCIALISTS WOULD BE PUZZLED TO ACCEPT OR CONFUTE
THEY WERE HELD IN DESERTED CABINS OF ROUND LOGS WITH EARTHEN FLOORS AND SMALL HOLES FOR WINDOWS SOMETIMES ILLUMINATED BY AS MUCH LIGHT AS COULD PENETRATE THROUGH PANES OF PAPER GREASED WITH LARD
AT THIS AS HAS BEEN SAID OF ANOTHER HERO THE SPIRIT OF ODIN ENTERED INTO HIM AND PUTTING FORTH HIS WHOLE STRENGTH HE HELD THE PRIDE OF CLARY'S GROVE IN HIS ARMS LIKE A CHILD AND ALMOST CHOKED THE EXUBERANT LIFE OUT OF HIM
BUT BEING ENTIRELY WITHOUT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE HE WAS FORCED TO LOOK ABOUT FOR SOME SUITABLE OCCUPATION
FOR COUNTING HIS ATTENDANCE UNDER RINEY AND HAZEL IN KENTUCKY AND UNDER DORSEY CRAWFORD AND SWANEY IN INDIANA IT AMOUNTED TO LESS THAN A YEAR IN ALL
ON THE CONTRARY HE ASSUMED THAT THE BOUNDARY WAS AN UNSETTLED ONE BETWEEN MEXICO AND TEXAS
I HEAR MEN NOW SAY SAID HE THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO ACQUIESCE IN IT
TO RESTORE THAT BALANCE THE SOUTH HAD CONSUMMATED THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE AS A FIRST AND INDISPENSABLE STEP
THE OFFICE OF GOVERNOR WHICH WOULD OF NECESSITY INTERFERE WITH THE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION WOULD POORLY COMPENSATE HIM FOR THE LOSS OF FOUR OF THE BEST YEARS OF HIS LIFE HE SERVED THIS YEAR AS A MEMBER OF THE WHIG CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND BORE A PROMINENT PART IN THE MOVEMENT SET ON FOOT AT THAT TIME TO CHECK INTEMPERANCE IN THE USE OF SPIRITS
THE YOUNG STATE SWARMED WITH POLITICIANS
THE NEW DISCUSSION WAS FRAUGHT WITH DEEPER QUESTIONS THAN THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE SANGAMON PROTECTIVE TARIFFS OR THE ORIGIN OF THE MEXICAN WAR
YET SAGACIOUS POLITICIANS FORESAW THAT ON THE WHOLE HE WAS STRENGTHENED BY HIS DEFEAT
AVOWING THE ONE LETTER HE HAD WRITTEN AND SAYING THAT IT HAD BEEN PRINTED SOLELY FOR POLITICAL EFFECT AND WITHOUT ANY INTENTION OF INJURING SHIELDS PERSONALLY
WRITING TO HIS FRIEND SPEED SOON AFTER HIS ELECTION HE SAID
WHEN THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN LINCOLN WAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN HE MADE ON THE WHOLE A SATISFACTORY CLERK FOR MR OFFUTT THOUGH HIS DOWNRIGHT HONESTY MUST HAVE SEEMED OCCASIONALLY AS ECCENTRIC IN THAT POSITION AS AFTERWARDS IT DID TO HIS ASSOCIATES AT THE BAR
EWING WHO WAS ELECTED BY A MAJORITY OF ONE VOTE
ALL WORE MOCCASINS AND WERE BELTED AROUND THE WAIST AND CARRIED SIDE-KNIVES USED BY THE HUNTERS YET AMIDST ALL THIS APPARENT SAVAGERY WE SEE JUSTICE WAS DONE AND THE LAW VINDICATED EVEN AGAINST THE BITTEREST PREJUDICES OF THESE PIONEER JURYMEN
IT BEING THE TRUE INTENT AND MEANING OF THIS ACT NOT TO LEGISLATE SLAVERY INTO ANY TERRITORY OR STATE NOR TO EXCLUDE IT THEREFROM BUT TO LEAVE THE PEOPLE THEREOF PERFECTLY FREE TO FORM AND REGULATE THEIR DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS IN THEIR OWN WAY SUBJECT ONLY TO THE CONSTITUTION"--A CHANGE WHICH BENTON TRUTHFULLY CHARACTERIZED AS A STUMP SPEECH INJECTED INTO THE BELLY OF THE NEBRASKA BILL TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE
UNTIL THE TREATY OF GREENVILLE IN 1795 CLOSED THE LONG AND SANGUINARY HISTORY OF THE OLD INDIAN WARS THERE WAS NO DAY IN WHICH THE PIONEER COULD LEAVE HIS CABIN WITH THE CERTAINTY OF NOT FINDING IT IN ASHES WHEN HE RETURNED AND HIS LITTLE FLOCK MURDERED ON HIS THRESHOLD OR CARRIED INTO A CAPTIVITY WORSE THAN DEATH
BUT IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER HE LOST ANYTHING BY BEING DEPRIVED OF THE MINISTRATIONS OF THE BACKWOODS DOMINIES
LINCOLN WAS NOT YET DONE WITH VANDALIA ITS DINNERS OF GAME AND ITS POLITICAL INTRIGUE
HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED FROM THE BORDER STATE OF MARYLAND AND IS REPRESENTED TO HAVE BEEN A DILIGENT STUDENT A RESPECTABLE LAWYER A PROMINENT DEMOCRATIC POLITICIAN AND POSSESSED OF THE PERSONAL INSTINCTS AND DEMEANOR OF A GENTLEMAN
THAT IT WAS THE DUTY OF THE PRO-SLAVERY UNION-LOVING MEN OF KANSAS TO KNOW BUT ONE ISSUE SLAVERY
BOTH OUR ARMIES IN MEXICO WERE UNDER THE COMMAND OF WHIG GENERALS AND AMONG THE SUBORDINATE OFFICERS WHO HAD DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES IN THE FIELD A FULL SHARE WERE WHIGS WHO TO AN EXTENT UNUSUAL IN WARS OF POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE RETAINED THEIR ATTITUDE OF HOSTILITY TO THE ADMINISTRATION UNDER WHOSE ORDERS THEY WERE SERVING
CONGRESS ADJOURNED EARLY IN AUGUST BUT DOUGLAS DELAYED HIS RETURN TO ILLINOIS
THEY GENERALLY REFUSED TO SUM UP OR TO COMMENT UPON EVIDENCE
HE WAS DONE WITH THE WILD CARELESSNESS OF THE WOODS WITH THE JOLLY RUFFIANISM OF CLARY'S GROVE WITH THE PETTY CHAFFERING OF GROCERY STORES WITH ODD JOBS FOR DAILY BREAD WITH ALL THE UNCOUTH SQUALOR OF THE FRONTIER POVERTY
WHEN THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS CAME TO THE PRACTICAL WORK OF PROVIDING A GOVERNMENT FOR THE WESTERN LANDS WHICH THE FINANCIAL PRESSURE AND THE ABSOLUTE NEED OF UNION COMPELLED NEW YORK AND VIRGINIA TO CEDE TO THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT THOMAS JEFFERSON PROPOSED AMONG OTHER FEATURES IN HIS PLAN AND DRAFT OF 1784 TO ADD A CLAUSE PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN ALL THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORY AFTER THE YEAR 1800
BUTTER WAS EIGHT CENTS A POUND AND EGGS WERE EIGHT CENTS A DOZEN
THE GROUND HAD NOTHING ATTRACTIVE ABOUT IT BUT ITS CHEAPNESS

THAT WE HAVE NEGLECTED NO MEANS IN OUR POWER TO ASCERTAIN THE TRUTH
AND THE MEN FROM THE COUNTRY THE PIONEERS AND FARMERS ALWAYS GATHERED EAGERLY ABOUT THESE GROUPS AND LISTENED WITH OPEN-MOUTHED INTEREST AND FREQUENTLY MANIFESTED THEIR APPROVAL OR DISSENT IN STRONG WORDS AND CARRIED AWAY TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS A REPORT OF THE DEBATERS WIT AND SKILL
THE SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS MAINTAINED THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZED THEIR RIGHT AND GUARANTEED THEM PROTECTION TO THEIR SLAVE PROPERTY IF THEY CHOSE TO CARRY IT INTO FEDERAL TERRITORIES

HIS CLOSE AND CAREFUL STUDY OF HIS CASES TOGETHER WITH THE LARGER AND MORE IMPORTANT RANGE OF PRACTICE TO WHICH LINCOLN WAS INTRODUCED BY THIS NEW ASSOCIATION CONFIRMED ALL THOSE SALUTARY TENDENCIES BY WHICH HE HAD BEEN LED INTO THE PROFESSION AND CORRECTED THOSE LESS DESIRABLE ONES WHICH HE SHARED WITH MOST OF THE LAWYERS ABOUT HIM

WINTHROP CHOSEN SPEAKER
A FEW FANATICAL MEN WHO HAD MADE IT THE VEHICLE OF VIOLENT EXPRESSIONS HAD KEPT IT UNDER THE BAN OF POPULAR PREJUDICE
TO HAVE INTIMATED ONE YEAR AGO SAID THE SPEAKER IN HIS ADDRESS OF THANKS THAT SUCH A RESULT WOULD BE WROUGHT OUT ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN THOUGHT A VISIONARY
BUT IT WAS CONSIDERED DISLOYAL TO LOOK TOO CURIOUSLY INTO SUCH MATTERS
FROM THE DISCUSSION WE LEARN THAT THE BOUNDARIES WERE THE MISSOURI RIVER ON THE EAST THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS ON THE WEST THE LINE OF 36 DEGREES 30 OR SOUTHERN LINE OF MISSOURI ON THE SOUTH AND THE LINE OF 43 DEGREES OR NEAR THE NORTHERN LINE OF IOWA ON THE NORTH
IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT LINCOLN MADE DISHONORABLE CONCESSIONS OF PRINCIPLE TO GET THE VOTES OF LOVEJOY AND HIS FRIENDS
AROUND THIS ALLEGED SETTLEMENT DISTASTEFUL AS IT WAS TO MANY PUBLIC OPINION GRADUALLY CRYSTALLIZED
THE MOTIVES WHICH LED HIM TO TAKE THIS DECISIVE COURSE ARE NOT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE
THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THE EARNESTNESS OF THE BODY OF THIS FACTION
AMERICAN CONFLICT P
AT THE OUTSET OF THE CAMPAIGN MR CLAY'S AVOWED OPINION AS TO THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS WAS THAT OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF HIS PARTY ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH
BUT SUCH HAD BEEN THE INTEREST CREATED BY THE POLITICAL EXCITEMENT AND SO FAVORABLE WERE THE NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF THE LOCATION SOIL AND CLIMATE OF THE NEW COUNTRY THAT A FEW MONTHS SUFFICED TO CHANGE KANSAS FROM A CLOSED AND PROHIBITED INDIAN RESERVE TO THE EMIGRANT'S LAND OF PROMISE
BUT THE BORDER RUFFIANS WITH THEIR BACKWOODS RIFLES AND SHOTGUNS WERE A READY RESOURCE
414 ILLUSTRATION
THE CIRCUIT JUDGES WERE TURNED OUT OF OFFICE AND FIVE NEW JUDGES WERE ADDED TO THE SUPREME COURT WHO WERE TO PERFORM CIRCUIT DUTY ALSO
HIS PRESENCE ON THE CIRCUIT WAS WATCHED FOR WITH INTEREST AND NEVER FAILED TO PRODUCE JOY OR HILARITY
SUCH PUBLICITY AS COULD NOT BE AVOIDED SERVED RATHER TO FAN THE EXCITEMENT STRENGTHEN THE HESITATING AND FROWN DOWN ALL DISSENT AND OPPOSITION
LANE'S COPIES SERVED ONLY AS TEXT FOR ANGRY DEBATE
SINCE THE REMOVAL OF REEDER ALL THE FEDERAL OFFICIALS OF THE TERRITORY WERE AFFILIATED WITH THE PRO-SLAVERY MISSOURI CABAL
PRODUCED BY ROBERT NIELD TOM ALLEN DAVID MOYNIHAN CHARLES FRANKS AND THE ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM
TO RESTRICT SLAVERY TO THOSE STATES IN WHICH IT EXISTS
FIRST THE ECONOMIC EFFORTS TO PREVENT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE MONETARY VALUE OF FOUR MILLIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS HELD IN BONDAGE WHO WERE BOUGHT AND SOLD AS CHATTELS AND WHOSE AGGREGATE VALUATION UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AT THE OUTBREAK OF THE CIVIL WAR WAS VARIOUSLY COMPUTED AT $400,000,000 TO $1,600,000,000
186 SIDENOTE
ITS HISTORY IS ONE OF DISASTER TO THE STATE
ONE UNMISTAKABLE SIGN IS THAT ALL THE ODDS AND ENDS ARE WITH US,--BARNBURNERS NATIVE AMERICANS TYLER MEN DISAPPOINTED OFFICE-SEEKING LOCO-FOCOS AND THE LORD KNOWS WHAT
THEN HE WOULD PRESENT HIS OWN SIDE OF THE CASE WITH A CLEARNESS A CANDOR AN ADROITNESS OF STATEMENT WHICH AT ONCE FLATTERED AND CONVINCED THE JURY AND MADE EVEN THE BYSTANDERS HIS PARTISANS
FROM THIS DEPARTURE ALL WERE SUBJECT TO THE INEXORABLE EQUALITY OF THE CAMP
IT SOON BECAME APPARENT THAT THE WHIGS WERE TO DERIVE AT LEAST A TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE FROM THE WAR WHICH THE DEMOCRATS HAD BROUGHT UPON THE COUNTRY ALTHOUGH IT WAS DESTINED IN ITS LATER CONSEQUENCES TO SWEEP THE FORMER PARTY OUT OF EXISTENCE AND EXILE THE OTHER FROM POWER FOR MANY YEARS
FROM ALTON TO MOUNT CARMEL
THE GOVERNOR IMMEDIATELY CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS AND WAS HIMSELF ASTONISHED AT THE ALACRITY WITH WHICH THE CALL WAS ANSWERED
YOUR THOUSAND PRETENSES DECEIVE NOBODY BUT YOURSELF
THESE VAST WORKS WERE VOTED WITHOUT ESTIMATES WITHOUT SURVEYS WITHOUT ANY RATIONAL CONSIDERATION OF THEIR NECESSITY
HE MET BOTH SQUARELY AND IF HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE ONE OR ANSWER THE OTHER SUBSTANTIALLY ADMITTED IT

CONGRESS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROHIBIT THE SLAVE-TRADE BUT NOT TILL THE LAPSE OF TWENTY YEARS
HIS INTRODUCTION TO HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS WAS EFFECTED IN A PECULIAR AND SOMEWHAT STRIKING MANNER
A COMMITTEE OF SAFETY HURRIEDLY INSTITUTED SENT A CALL FOR HELP FROM LAWRENCE TO OTHER POINTS IN THE TERRITORY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEFENDING IT FROM THREATENED INVASION BY ARMED MEN NOW QUARTERED IN ITS VICINITY SEVERAL HUNDRED FREE-STATE MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
BUT IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER THERE IS A GOVERNMENT ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH WHICH UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD NOT HAVE YIELDED TO THE SAME TEMPTATION
NO SPY OR PIONEER OR VAGRANT TRAPPER HAS EVER RETURNED TO REPORT THE CHARACTER AND SCENERY OF THAT WASTE AND LONELY WILDERNESS
LOGAN A YOUNG LAWYER WHO HAD RECENTLY COME FROM KENTUCKY WITH THE BEST EQUIPMENT FOR A NISI PRIUS PRACTITIONER EVER BROUGHT INTO THE STATE
SHIELDS AND MATTESON
THE GREAT SUPERIORITY OF CALIBER SHOWN IN THE NOMINATIONS OF THE MUTINEERS OVER THE REGULAR DEMOCRATS WAS ALSO APPARENT IN THE ROLL OF THOSE WHO MADE AND SUSTAINED THE REVOLT
THOUGH THE DISCUSSION OF PARTY QUESTIONS HAD BEEN GOING ON ALL SUMMER WITH MORE OR LESS BRISKNESS YET SUCH WAS THE GENERAL CONFUSION IN POLITICS THAT MANY HONEST AND INTELLIGENT VOTERS AND EVEN LEADERS WERE STILL UNDECIDED IN THEIR OPINIONS
THEIR WORDS STUNG THE SLAVE-HOLDING STATES TO SOMETHING LIKE FRENZY
HE SAYS AS ANY ONE MIGHT SAY THAT PROVIDED CERTAIN IMPOSSIBLE CONDITIONS WERE COMPLIED WITH HE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE TEXAS IN THE UNION AND THAT HE WAS SO SURE OF THE ULTIMATE EXTINCTION OF SLAVERY THAT HE WOULD NOT LET ANY CONSIDERATION OF THAT TRANSITORY SYSTEM INTERFERE WITH A GREAT NATIONAL ADVANTAGE
BUT FOR THIS GENEROSITY OUR LEGS WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO THE BETTER WORK
I WISH TO INQUIRE OF THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO MR GIDDINGS WHO I BELIEVE IS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ON TERRITORIES WHY THE ORDINANCE OF 1787 IS NOT INCORPORATED IN THIS BILL
ANOTHER WAS THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE OR AS IT IS COMMONLY CALLED THE SLAVERY RESTRICTION
TWICE THEY ADOPTED HIM INTO THEIR TRIBES WHILE THEY WERE STILL ON THE WAR-PATH
HIS GREAT STATURE DID NOT ENCUMBER HIM THERE

HE CAME TO HIS PLACE UNHERALDED AND WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL PERSONAL PRETENSIONS
WHILE THE GREATER NUMBER ABSORBED IN OTHER SCHEMES WERE WHOLLY INDIFFERENT AND PROBABLY CAST THEIR VOTES UPON PERSONAL SOLICITATION

THOUGH THEY SOMETIMES JOIN IN FESTIVITIES IT IS BUT SELDOM AND THE WILDNESS OF THEIR DISSIPATION IS TOO OFTEN IN PROPORTION TO ITS INFREQUENCY
ONLY THE UTTERANCES OF FERVID PROPHECY FOUND LISTENERS
THE SANGAMO JOURNAL OF SEPT 12 1835 CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING OFFICIAL ADVERTISEMENT
AND HE PASSED HIS TIME INDOCTRINATING THE JACKSON MEN WITH THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF PARTY ORGANIZATION TEACHINGS WHICH THEY EAGERLY ABSORBED AND WHICH SEEMED SINISTER AND OMINOUS TO THE WHIGS
AS JUDGE DAVIS SAID HE SEEMED NEVER TO CARE FOR IT HE HAD A GOOD INCOME FROM HIS PROFESSION THOUGH THE FEES HE RECEIVED WOULD BRING A SMILE TO THE WELL-PAID LIPS OF THE GREAT ATTORNEYS OF TO-DAY
GENERAL WHITESIDES MARCHED OUT TO THE SCENE OF THE DISASTER THE NEXT MORNING BUT THE INDIANS WERE GONE
BUT A DILEMMA NOW AROSE
WHEN HE ACTED AS SURVEYOR HERE HE WAS DEPUTY OF T
WE STILL SHALL HAVE THE PROUD CONSOLATION OF SAYING TO OUR CONSCIENCES AND TO THE DEPARTED SHADE OF OUR COUNTRY'S FREEDOM THAT THE CAUSE APPROVED OF OUR JUDGMENT AND ADORED OF OUR HEARTS IN DISASTER IN CHAINS IN TORTURE IN DEATH WE NEVER FALTERED IN DEFENDING THESE PERFERVID AND MUSICAL METAPHORS OF DEVOTION AND DEFIANCE HAVE OFTEN BEEN QUOTED AS MR LINCOLN'S HEROIC CHALLENGE TO THE SLAVE POWER AND BISHOP SIMPSON GAVE THEM THAT LOFTY SIGNIFICANCE IN HIS FUNERAL ORATION
OWING TO THE ILLNESS OF MR HOWARD CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE THE LONG AND ELABORATE MAJORITY REPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE WAS WRITTEN BY JOHN SHERMAN
HE PREDICTS FOR HIM A PERIOD OF NERVOUS DEPRESSION--FIRST BECAUSE HE WILL BE EXPOSED TO BAD WEATHER ON HIS JOURNEY AND SECONDLY BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF ALL BUSINESS AND CONVERSATION OF FRIENDS WHICH MIGHT DIVERT HIS MIND AND GIVE IT OCCASIONAL REST FROM THE INTENSITY OF THOUGHT WHICH WILL SOMETIMES WEAR THE SWEETEST IDEA THREADBARE AND TURN IT TO THE BITTERNESS OF DEATH THE THIRD CAUSE HE SAYS IS THE RAPID AND NEAR APPROACH OF THAT CRISIS ON WHICH ALL YOUR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS CONCENTRATE IF IN SPITE OF ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOULD ESCAPE WITHOUT A TWINGE OF THE SOUL HIS FRIEND WILL BE MOST HAPPILY DECEIVED
AS THE PAPER CONTAINING THIS JOYOUS INTELLIGENCE ALSO COMPLAINED THAT NO MAIL HAD REACHED SPRINGFIELD FROM THE EAST FOR THREE WEEKS IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE FOR MORE RAPID AND REGULAR COMMUNICATIONS
ON THE 19TH OF JANUARY 1841 JOHN J
HE WARNED HIS CORRESPONDENTS DAY BY DAY OF EVERY MOVE ON THE BOARD
THERE WAS THE USUAL RUSH OF AMENDMENTS AND OF PARLIAMENTARY STRATEGY AND THE INDORSING RESOLUTIONS WHICH FINALLY PASSED IN BOTH HOUSES IN AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE AND BY A DIMINISHED VOTE WERE SHORN OF MUCH OF THEIR POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE
FOR ALTHOUGH IT WAS EVERYWHERE AGREED EXCEPT AT VANDALIA THAT THE CAPITAL OUGHT TO BE MOVED EVERY CITY IN THE STATE AND SEVERAL WHICH EXISTED ONLY ON PAPER DEMANDED TO BE MADE THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT
THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO MONEY IN CIRCULATION
THE YOUNG MERCHANTS HAD TIED UP FOR THE NIGHT AND WERE ASLEEP IN THE CABIN WHEN THEY WERE AROUSED BY SHUFFLING FOOTSTEPS WHICH PROVED TO BE A GANG OF MARAUDING NEGROES COMING TO ROB THE BOAT
ONE OF HIS EMPLOYERS SAYS HE COULD SINK AN AXE DEEPER INTO WOOD THAN ANY MAN I EVER SAW WITH STRENGTH LIKE THIS AND A BRAIN TO DIRECT IT A MAN WAS A BORN LEADER IN THAT COUNTRY AND AT THAT TIME
BUT ACTING UNDER THE SENSE OF THE DUTY WHICH ANIMATES ME I AM PREPARED TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE
LAMBORN WAS TALKING AND WE SUDDENLY HEARD BAKER INTERRUPTING HIM WITH A SHARP REMARK THEN A RUSTLING AND UPROAR
BUT IF WHEN THE WAR HAD BEGUN AND HAD BECOME THE CAUSE OF THE COUNTRY THE GIVING OF OUR MONEY AND OUR BLOOD IN COMMON WITH YOURS WAS SUPPORT OF THE WAR THEN IT IS NOT TRUE THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS OPPOSED THE WAR
THIS DECLARED INDIFFERENCE BUT AS I MUST THINK COVERT ZEAL FOR THE SPREAD OF SLAVERY I CANNOT BUT HATE
THE GOVERNOR AND OTHER PRISONERS WERE KEPT ON THE PRAIRIE NEAR LECOMPTON UNTIL THE 10TH OF SEPTEMBER 1856 WHEN ALL WERE RELEASED END OF VOL
ON THE AFTERNOON OF HIS COMING MANY FLAGS IN THE CITY AND ON THE SHIPPING IN THE RIVER AND HARBOR WERE HUNG AT HALF MAST
THE AMENDMENT WAS ADOPTED--EIGHTY TO SIXTY-FOUR--AND THE BILL REPORTED TO THE HOUSE
TO MAKE THE MATTER SURE YOUR ENTIRE SENATORIAL DISTRICT MUST BE SECURED
YET SO LITTLE KNOWN IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS WERE THESE EARLY WORKERS IN THIS GREAT REFORM THAT WHEN THE MAYOR OF BOSTON RECEIVED REMONSTRANCES FROM CERTAIN SOUTHERN STATES AGAINST SUCH AN INCENDIARY PUBLICATION AS THE LIBERATOR HE WAS ABLE TO SAY THAT NO MEMBER OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT AND NO PERSON OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE HAD EVER HEARD OF THE PAPER OR ITS EDITOR
AT LACON IN MARSHALL THE VERY MOST ACTIVE FRIEND I HAVE IN THE DISTRICT IF I EXCEPT YOURSELF IS AT WORK
SUCH LANGUAGE FROM A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL SHOCKED AND INFURIATED THE COMMITTEE AND THOSE WHOM THEY REPRESENTED
IN A LIFE LIKE THEIRS A LAUGH SEEMED WORTH HAVING AT ANY EXPENSE
MOST OF THE RECORDS BELONGING TO THAT BRANCH OF THE FAMILY WERE DESTROYED IN THE CIVIL WAR
AT THE VARIOUS TIMES WHEN I HAVE HELPED YOU A LITTLE YOU HAVE SAID TO ME WE CAN GET ALONG VERY WELL NOW BUT IN A VERY SHORT TIME I FIND YOU IN THE SAME DIFFICULTY AGAIN
INDEED IT IS NOT TO BE DISGUISED THAT OUR ATTITUDE AS A NATION AND OUR POSITION ON THE GLOBE RENDER THE ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN POSSESSIONS NOT WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION EMINENTLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR PROTECTION IF NOT IN THE FUTURE ESSENTIAL FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE RIGHTS OF COMMERCE AND THE PEACE OF THE WORLD REACHING THE SLAVERY QUESTION HE EXPRESSED UNBOUNDED DEVOTION TO THE UNION AND DECLARED SLAVERY RECOGNIZED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND HIS PURPOSE TO ENFORCE THE COMPROMISE MEASURES OF 1850 ADDING I FERVENTLY TRUST THAT THE QUESTION IS AT REST AND THAT NO SECTIONAL OR AMBITIOUS OR FANATICAL EXCITEMENT MAY AGAIN THREATEN THE DURABILITY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS OR OBSCURE THE LIGHT OF OUR PROSPERITY SIDEBAR
THERE WAS NO MAN MORE DREADED AND DISLIKED THAN HE WAS BY THE STALWART YOUNG WHIGS AGAINST WHOM HE WAS ORGANIZING THAT SOLID AND DISCIPLINED OPPOSITION
AND IT REQUIRED ALL HIS SKILL AND INFLUENCE TO ACCOMPLISH THE RATIFICATION OF THE ALASKA PURCHASE
I WAS LOSING INTEREST IN POLITICS WHEN THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE AROUSED ME AGAIN HIS SERVICE IN CONGRESS HAD MADE HIM MORE GENERALLY KNOWN THAN FORMERLY AND HAD INCREASED HIS PRACTICAL VALUE AS A MEMBER OF ANY LAW FIRM
BUT WHILE THE FRENZY LASTED THERE WAS NO CONSIDERATION OF COST OR OF POSSIBILITIES
NEITHER STATE NOR NATION HAS EVER REMOVED THE SNAGS FROM THE SANGAMON AND NO SUBSEQUENT NAVIGATOR OF ITS WATERS HAS BEEN FOUND TO ECLIPSE THE FAME OF THE EARLIEST ONE
AT LEAST IT WILL RENT FOR SOMETHING
HORSES WERE SADDLED TEAMS HARNESSED WAGONS LOADED WITH TENTS FORAGE AND PROVISIONS BOWIE-KNIVES BUCKLED ON REVOLVERS AND RIFLES LOADED AND FLAGS AND INSCRIPTIONS FLUNG TO THE BREEZE BY THE MORE DEMONSTRATIVE AND DARING
FINALLY SEEING NO CHANCE OF OTHERWISE TERMINATING THE CONTEST THE HOUSE YIELDED TO THE INEVITABLE DOMINATION OF THE SLAVERY QUESTION AND RESOLVED ON FEBRUARY 2 BY A VOTE OF 113 TO 104 TO ELECT UNDER THE PLURALITY RULE AFTER THE NEXT THREE BALLOTINGS
HIS FURY AGAINST THE UNKNOWN AUTHOR OF THE SATIRE WAS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH MERRIMENT IN SPRINGFIELD AND THE NEXT WEEK ANOTHER LETTER APPEARED FROM A DIFFERENT HAND BUT ADOPTING THE MACHINERY OF THE FIRST IN WHICH THE WIDOW OFFERED TO MAKE UP THE QUARREL BY MARRYING THE AUDITOR AND THIS IN TIME WAS FOLLOWED BY AN EPITHALAMIUM IN WHICH THIS HAPPY COMPROMISE WAS CELEBRATED IN VERY BAD VERSES
ONE-SIXTH OF THE PRINTED LAWS OF THE FIRST SESSION ATTEST THEIR MODEST ATTENTION TO THIS INCIDENTAL SQUATTERS DOWRY
HE WAS HIMSELF CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE
ONE OF HIS EMPLOYERS UNDAZZLED BY RECENT HISTORY FAITHFULLY REMEMBERS THAT YOUNG ABE LIKED HIS DINNER AND HIS PAY BETTER THAN HIS WORK
CHAPTER IX COLLAPSE OF THE SYSTEM MR LINCOLN HAD MADE THUS FAR VERY LITTLE MONEY--NOTHING MORE IN FACT THAN A SUBSISTENCE OF THE MOST MODEST CHARACTER
BUT HE CONTINUES IF YOU SHALL AS I EXPECT YOU WILL AT SOME TIME BE AGONIZED AND DISTRESSED LET ME WHO HAVE SOME REASON TO SPEAK WITH JUDGMENT ON THE SUBJECT BESEECH YOU TO ASCRIBE IT TO THE CAUSES I HAVE MENTIONED AND NOT TO SOME FALSE AND RUINOUS SUGGESTION OF THE DEVIL THIS FORMS THE PRELUDE TO AN INGENIOUS AND AFFECTIONATE ARGUMENT IN WHICH HE LABORS TO CONVINCE SPEED OF THE LOVELINESS OF HIS BETROTHED AND OF THE INTEGRITY OF HIS OWN HEART
LINCOLN WRITING A DAY OR TWO AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE CONVENTION SAID
THAT AMID THE CONSIDERATION OF MERE PERSONAL INTERESTS HE WAS VIGILANTLY PURSUING THE STUDY OF THE HIGHER PHASES OF THE GREAT MORAL AND POLITICAL STRUGGLE ON WHICH THE NATION WAS JUST ENTERING LITTLE DREAMING HOWEVER OF THE PART HE WAS DESTINED TO ACT IN IT
BRIGADIER-GENERAL HENRY ATKINSON IN HIS REPORT OF MAY 30 1832 STATED THAT THE ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS WERE CALLED OUT BY THE GOVERNOR OF THAT STATE BUT IN HASTE AND FOR NO DEFINITE PERIOD OF SERVICE
THE LABORS OF HENDERSON AND THE TRANSYLVANIA COMPANY HAD BEGUN TO BEAR FRUIT IN EXTENSIVE PLANTATIONS AND A CONNECTED SYSTEM OF FORTS
HE TALKED SINGULARLY WELL BUT NEVER ABOUT HIMSELF
BUT MORE GENERALLY THEY WERE DENOUNCED UPON A GROSS MISREPRESENTATION OF THEIR UTTERANCE AND PURPOSE
IN 1835 THEY BEGAN TO GRANT CHARTERS FOR RAILROADS WHICH REMAINED IN EMBRYO AS THE STOCK WAS NEVER TAKEN
PECK WAS LOOKED UPON WITH DISTRUST AND SUSPICION FOR SEVERAL REASONS ALL OF WHICH SEEMED VALID TO THE RURAL LEGISLATORS ASSEMBLED THERE
THE BLOOD MONEY WHICH REDDENED THE HANDS OF ENGLISH ROYALTY STAINED EQUALLY THOSE OF MANY AN AMERICAN REBEL
JIM SOLD HIS SHARE TO AN IDLE AND DISSOLUTE MAN NAMED BERRY AND ROW SOON TRANSFERRED HIS INTEREST TO LINCOLN
4 1855 POCKETING THIS REBUFF AS BEST THEY MIGHT SENATOR ATCHISON AND HIS BLUE LODGES NEVERTHELESS HELD FAST TO THEIR PURPOSE
REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE THE BOGUS LAWS
ABRAHAM INSTANTLY ATTACKED THEM WITH A CLUB KNOCKED SEVERAL OVERBOARD AND PUT THE REST TO FLIGHT
AND YIELD LESSER ONES THOUGH CLEARLY YOUR OWN
IT SHALL NOT DETER ME
HIS WIFE WAS A SHIPLEY RELOCATED FOOTNOTE 2

PASSAGE OF THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA ACT CHAPTER XX
ZACHARY TAYLOR FROM THE PAINTING BY VANDERLYN IN THE CORCORAN GALLERY
JOHN M
HE TOOK WITH HIM FUNDS ENOUGH TO ENTER AN AMOUNT OF LAND WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE HIS FAMILY RICH IF THEY HAD RETAINED IT
THE SOUND AND FURY OF THEM HAVE PASSED AWAY INTO SILENCE
THE TWO YOUNG MEN WERE IN SPRINGFIELD TOGETHER IN THE AUTUMN AND LINCOLN SEEMS BY THAT TIME TO HAVE LAID ASIDE HIS OWN PECULIAR BESETMENTS IN ORDER TO MINISTER TO HIS FRIEND
IF THE NORTH WAS ALARMED AT BEING THUS PLACED IN A MINORITY THERE WAS AMPLE REASON FOR STILL FURTHER DISQUIETUDE
BUT IMPERFECT AS WAS THE APPRECIATION AT THAT DAY OF THE POSSIBILITIES WHICH LAY HIDDEN IN THOSE SUNSET REGIONS THERE WAS STILL ENOUGH OF INSTINCTIVE GREED IN THE MINDS OF POLITICIANS TO MAKE THE NEW REALM A SUBJECT OF LIVELY INTEREST AND INTRIGUE
THAT HE WAS KNOWN SIMPLY AS A RATHER QUIET YOUNG MAN GOOD-NATURED AND SENSIBLE
THE CONVENTION HAD BEEN HELD
THEIR TABLE WAS FAMED FOR THE EXCELLENCE OF MANY RARE KENTUCKY DISHES AND FOR THE VENISON WILD TURKEYS AND OTHER GAME THEN SO ABUNDANT
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END ALTHOUGH THE REST OF HIS LIFE WAS PASSED IN HOT AND EARNEST DEBATE HE NEVER AGAIN DESCENDED TO THE LEVEL OF HIS ADVERSARIES WHO WOULD GLADLY ENOUGH HAVE RESORTED TO UNSEEMLY WRANGLING
BIRNEY THE LIBERTY CANDIDATE HAD BEEN CAST FOR CLAY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED AND EVEN AS IT WAS THE CONTEST WAS CLOSE AND DOUBTFUL TO THE LAST
THEY HAD COLLECTED A WAGON-LOAD OF GAME AND WERE ON THEIR WAY HOME WHEN THE STORM STRUCK THEM
MR STUART SAID THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE BITTERLY COMPLAINED OF THE AMOUNT OF GAME--VENISON AND GROUSE OF THE MOST DELICIOUS QUALITY WHICH WAS SERVED THEM AT THE TAVERNS IN VANDALIA
ROBERT T
IN RELATION TO OUR CONGRESS MATTER HERE YOU WERE RIGHT IN SUPPOSING I WOULD SUPPORT THE NOMINEE
IN THE MISSOURI CAMP WHILE THE LEADERS BECAME ALARMED THE MEN GREW INSUBORDINATE
1818 BY THE TIME THE BOY ABRAHAM HAD ATTAINED HIS SEVENTH YEAR THE SOCIAL CONDITION OF KENTUCKY HAD CHANGED CONSIDERABLY FROM THE EARLY PIONEER DAYS
THE FORMER CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE TOWN HAD FAILED FOR WANT OF JUSTIFICATION
NEALE AND NOT OF CALHOUN AS HAS OFTEN BEEN SAID
HE HATED WRONG AND OPPRESSION EVERYWHERE AND MANY A MAN WHOSE FRAUDULENT CONDUCT WAS UNDERGOING REVIEW IN A COURT OF JUSTICE HAS WRITHED UNDER HIS TERRIFIC INDIGNATION AND REBUKES
THEY CLAMORED FOR BACON--THEY WERE STARVING THEY SAID FOR SOMETHING CIVILIZED THERE WAS PLENTY OF CIVILIZED NOURISHMENT IN SPRINGFIELD
A WALL OF INDIAN TRIBES GUARDED THE WEST
LOGAN LINCOLN'S NEAREST AND WARMEST FRIEND AROSE AND ANNOUNCED THE PURPOSE OF THE REMAINING WHIGS TO DECIDE THE CONTEST WHEREUPON THE ENTIRE FIFTEEN CHANGED THEIR VOTES TO TRUMBULL
ILLINOIS REGISTER IN SUPPORT OF THIS ALLEGED FINALITY NO ONE HAD TAKEN A MORE DECIDED STAND THAN SENATOR DOUGLAS HIMSELF
IN THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST THE GOVERNOR AUDITOR AND TREASURER ISSUED A CIRCULAR FORBIDDING THE PAYMENT OF STATE TAXES IN THIS DEPRECIATED PAPER
163 THERE WERE STILL EVEN SO LATE AS THE TIME TO WHICH WE ARE REFERRING TWO ALIEN ELEMENTS IN THE POPULATION OF THE STATE--THE FRENCH AND THE INDIANS
IN THIS HE MADE NO CONCESSION OF PRINCIPLE WHATEVER
MARRIAGE COURTSHIP AND ENGAGEMENT THE PIONEER TEMPERAMENT
DURING THE WINTER OF 1840-1 OCCURRED THE FIRST CLASH OF OPINION AND PRINCIPLE BETWEEN MR LINCOLN AND HIS LIFE-LONG ADVERSARY MR DOUGLAS
KENTUCKY HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARS THE COUNTRY OF ROMANCE AND FABLE FOR VIRGINIANS
ATCHISON OF MISSOURI THEN PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE AND ACTING VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
THE DEBT OF THE STATE ISSUED AT A CONTINUALLY INCREASING DISCOUNT HAD ALREADY ATTAINED ENORMOUS PROPORTIONS
NOT ALL WERE SO FORTUNATE
FRENCH AND INDIANS
I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WILL PROLONG OR SHORTEN THE DURATION OF THAT INSTITUTION
THEY WILL DO JUSTICE BETWEEN THE PARTIES ONE FAMOUS JUDGE WHO WAS AFTERWARDS GOVERNOR WHEN SENTENCING A MURDERER IMPRESSED IT UPON HIS MIND AND WISHED HIM TO INFORM HIS FRIENDS THAT IT WAS THE JURY AND NOT THE JUDGE WHO HAD FOUND HIM GUILTY AND THEN ASKED HIM ON WHAT DAY HE WOULD LIKE TO BE HANGED
THE UNDERSIGNED ARE WELL AWARE THAT THIS PROTEST WILL BE ALTOGETHER UNAVAILING WITH THE MAJORITY OF THIS BODY
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE 2 RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END AT THE FIRST SHOWING OF HANDS THE SOUTH WAS SUCCESSFUL
GOVERNOR FORD WRITING ABOUT 1847 ATTRIBUTES THIS RESULT TO THE FACT THAT THE BEST CLASS OF SOUTHERN PEOPLE WERE SLOW TO EMIGRATE TO A STATE WHERE THEY COULD NOT TAKE THEIR SLAVES
BUT ONE AND ALL REFUSED EXCEPT DAN STONE WHO WAS NOT A CANDIDATE FOR REELECTION HAVING RETIRED FROM POLITICS TO A SEAT ON THE BENCH
SARAH BUSH HAD BEEN AN ACQUAINTANCE OF THOMAS LINCOLN BEFORE HIS FIRST MARRIAGE
THE INDUCEMENT WHICH LED HIM TO LEAVE VIRGINIA WHERE HIS STANDING AND HIS FORTUNE WERE ASSURED WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY HIS INTIMATE FAMILY RELATIONS WITH THE GREAT EXPLORER THE HERO OF THE NEW COUNTRY OF KENTUCKY THE LAND OF FABULOUS RICHNESS AND UNLIMITED ADVENTURE
THE MAIN BROAD CURRENT OF HIS REASONING WAS TO VINDICATE AND RESTORE THE POLICY OF THE FATHERS OF THE COUNTRY IN THE RESTRICTION OF SLAVERY
HIS GREAT ERROR OF STATESMANSHIP ASIDE HE STANDS FORTH MORE THAN THE PEER OF ASSOCIATES WHO UNDERRATED HIS POWER AND LOOKED ASKANCE AT HIS PRETENSIONS
THEY WERE THE GLORY OF THE RACE OF RANGERS MATCHLESS WITH HORSE RIFLE SONG SUPPER COURTSHIP LARGE TURBULENT GENEROUS HANDSOME PROUD AND AFFECTIONATE BEARDED SUNBURNT DREST IN THE FREE COSTUME OF HUNTERS NOT A SINGLE ONE OVER THIRTY YEARS OF AGE CHAPTER XIV CAMPAIGN FOR CONGRESS IN THE MONTHS THAT REMAINED OF HIS TERM AFTER THE ELECTION OF HIS SUCCESSOR PRESIDENT TYLER PURSUED WITH MUCH VIGOR HIS PURPOSE OF ACCOMPLISHING THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS REGARDING IT AS THE MEASURE WHICH WAS SPECIALLY TO ILLUSTRATE HIS ADMINISTRATION AND TO PRESERVE IT FROM OBLIVION
AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE EMIGRATION SETTING THROUGH THE STATE FROM KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE TO MISSOURI
AND THESE GROWING WITH A STEADY THRIFT EXTENDED THEMSELVES UP THE MISSOURI RIVER
ONE CHILLY MORNING HE COMPLAINED OF BEING COLD
HE WROTE HIS PROTEST SAYING NOT ONE WORD HE WAS NOT READY TO STAND BY THEN AND THEREAFTER WASTING NOT A SYLLABLE IN RHETORIC OR FEELING KEEPING CLOSE TO LAW AND TRUTH AND JUSTICE
AS THE TOPEKA CONSTITUTION HAD NO LEGAL ORIGIN OR QUALITY TECHNICAL DEFEATS WERE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE ACTION BY THE FREE-STATE VOTERS OF KANSAS AT THEIR VOLUNTARY ELECTIONS FOR DELEGATES ON OCTOBER 9 AND TO RATIFY IT ON DECEMBER 15 1856 RELOCATED FOOTNOTE 2
BY THIS TIME HOWEVER THE SUBJECT OF REPEAL HAD BECOME BRUITED ABOUT THE CAPITOL CORRIDORS THE HOTELS AND THE CAUCUS ROOMS OF WASHINGTON AND NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS WERE ON THE QUI VIVE TO OBTAIN THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS CONCERNING THE INTRIGUE
HOLLAND GIN 183/4
MRS LINCOLN WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE HON
AND ACTING ON HIS OWN JUDGMENT ON HIS RETURN ISSUED A PROCLAMATION FOR A SIMPLE ELECTION OF A DELEGATE TO CONGRESS
WE OMIT THE PREAMBLE WHICH CONSISTS OF QUOTATIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
LINCOLN ELECTED
MR CALHOUN SUGGESTED A SIMILAR PROPOSITION LAST WINTER
INTIMACY WITH THE BOONES
THESE WERE QUICKLY RAISED FOOTNOTE
VERY UNEXPECTEDLY THEREFORE TO POLITICIANS OF ALL GRADES AND OPINIONS THE SLAVERY QUESTION WAS ONCE MORE BEFORE THE NATION IN THE YEAR 1850 OVER THE PROPOSITION TO ADMIT BOTH TO THE UNION AS STATES
IF A MAN HAD A DEBT NOT COLLECTIBLE THE CURRENT PHRASE WAS I'LL TAKE IT OUT OF HIS HIDE ILLUSTRATION
THE WHIGS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WERE FURIOUS AT THE UNLOOKED-FOR RESULT AND THE INCIDENT SERVED GREATLY TO COMPLICATE THE SENATORIAL CANVASS
THE MEXICANS THOUGH DEFICIENT IN SCIENCE AND IN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE FOUGHT WITH BRAVERY AND SOMETIMES WITH DESPERATION
BUT IT DOES NOT APPEAR SO TO US
IT WAS PROBABLY AS MUCH THE INEXHAUSTIBLE GOOD NATURE AND KINDLY HELPFULNESS OF YOUNG ABRAHAM WHICH KEPT THE PEACE AMONG ALL THESE HETEROGENEOUS ELEMENTS EFFERVESCING WITH YOUTH AND CONFINED IN A ONE-ROOMED CABIN AS IT WAS THE CHRISTIAN SWEETNESS AND FIRMNESS OF THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE
TIME AND AGAIN IT HAD BROUGHT MEMBERS INTO EXCITED DISCUSSION AND TO THE VERY VERGE OF PERSONAL CONFLICT IN THE LEGISLATIVE HALLS
THE UNITED STATES ADOPTED THE TEXAN CLAIM OF THE RIO GRANDE DEL NORTE AS THEIR WESTERN LIMIT
ALL HIS PRECAUTIONS CAME TO NOUGHT
TOWARDS THE END OF AUGUST THE CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESS IN THAT DISTRICT WERE IN WESTERN PHRASE ON THE TRACK RICHARD YATES AFTERWARDS ONE OF THE FAMOUS WAR GOVERNORS SOUGHT A REELECTION AS A WHIG
THEY HEARD FROM HIS LIPS FEWER ANECDOTES AND MORE HISTORY
THE MOLD LIES HEAVY ON EACH BREAST THE SPIRIT IS WITH GOD
REUBEN HARRISON PRESENTED THE FOLLOWING PETITION
WHEN THEY CAME TO YELLOW BANKS ON THE MISSISSIPPI THE PROVISION-BOATS HAD NOT ARRIVED AND FOR THREE DAYS THEY WAITED THERE LITERALLY WITHOUT FOOD
SARAH BUSH JOHNSTON
AT THIS DATE THEREFORE THE SLAVE STATES GAINED AN ACTUAL MAJORITY OF ONE THERE BEING FOURTEEN FREE STATES AND FIFTEEN SLAVE STATES WITH AT LEAST EQUAL TERRITORIAL PROSPECTS THROUGH FUTURE ANNEXATION
HE ALWAYS PROMISED THE LADIES WHOSE HEARTS HE WAS BESIEGING THAT THEY SHOULD LIVE IN THE TIMBER WHERE THEY COULD PICK UP THEIR OWN FIREWOOD THEFT WAS ALMOST UNKNOWN
SO EARLY AS APRIL HE WROTE TO A FRIEND
THE RISK WAS TOO GREAT FOR THE REST TO RUN
SO FAR AS PEACEFUL VOLUNTARY EMANCIPATION IS CONCERNED THE CONDITION OF THE NEGRO SLAVE IN AMERICA SCARCELY LESS TERRIBLE TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF A FREE MIND IS NOW AS FIXED AND HOPELESS OF CHANGE FOR THE BETTER AS THAT OF THE LOST SOULS OF THE FINALLY IMPENITENT
THEY ARE AS OPPOSITE AS GOD AND MAMMON
THOMAS JOHNSON AS PRESIDENT AND THE HOUSE WITH STRINGFELLOW OF THE SQUATTER SOVEREIGN AS SPEAKER NOW TURNED THEIR ATTENTION SERIOUSLY TO THE PRO-SLAVERY WORK BEFORE THEM
THIS WOULD SECURE THEM TO FREEDOM AS SLAVERY HAD LONG AGO BEEN ABOLISHED BY MEXICO
WHATEVER HE DESIGNS HE WILL DO FOR ME YET A BETTER NAME THAN SUPERSTITION MIGHT PROPERLY BE APPLIED TO THIS FRAME OF MIND
HE WENT BACK TO SPRINGFIELD AND RESUMED AT ONCE HIS PRACTICE THERE AND IN THE EIGHTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT WHERE HIS OCCUPATIONS AND HIS ASSOCIATES WERE THE MOST CONGENIAL THAT HE COULD ANYWHERE FIND
THE STATE OF TEXAS WAS BY A LATER RESOLUTION FORMALLY ADMITTED TO THE UNION DECEMBER 29 1845

ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE BILL WAS HURRIED OVER TO THE SENATE REFERRED TO MR DOUGLAS'S COMMITTEE AND BY HIM REPORTED BACK WITHOUT AMENDMENT ON FEBRUARY 17TH
ON THE SLAVERY QUESTION THEY DECLARED THEIR PURPOSE
THIS VIEW OF THE MATTER COMMENDED ITSELF FAVORABLY TO LINCOLN HIMSELF WHO HOWEVER GAVE IT UP ON ACCOUNT OF THE NATURAL UNWILLINGNESS OF HIS WIFE TO REMOVE TO A COUNTRY SO WILD AND SO REMOTE
THE LEGISLATURE PROCEEDED TO ELECT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICERS OF EACH COUNTY WHO IN TURN WERE EMPOWERED BY THE LAWS TO APPOINT THE SUBORDINATE OFFICIALS
LINCOLN HAD WRITTEN THE FIRST LETTER AND THE ANTIC FURY OF SHIELDS HAD INDUCED TWO YOUNG LADIES WHO TOOK A LIVELY INTEREST IN ILLINOIS POLITICS--AND WITH GOOD REASON FOR ONE WAS TO BE THE WIFE OF A SENATOR AND THE OTHER OF A PRESIDENT--TO FOLLOW UP THE GAME WITH ATTACKS IN PROSE AND VERSE WHICH HOWEVER DEFICIENT IN WIT AND METER WERE NOT WANTING IN PUNGENCY
HOWARD OF MICHIGAN JOHN SHERMAN FOOTNOTE
HE TOOK HOWEVER NO PROMINENT PART IN THE WORK BY WHICH THESE RAILROAD BILLS WERE PASSED
WILKES OF VIRGINIA
ITS NEARNESS TO AN ESTABLISHED POST OFFICE AND ITS CONTIGUITY TO MISSOURI PRO-SLAVERY SENTIMENT WERE ELEMENTS PROBABLY NOT LOST SIGHT OF
GOVERNOR EDWARDS COMPLAINING SO LATE AS 1829 OF THE SUPERIOR MAIL FACILITIES AFFORDED TO MISSOURI SAYS
THE TOWN OF WESTPORT WHICH COULD BOAST OF A POST OFFICE LAY ONLY FOUR MILES TO THE EASTWARD ON THE MISSOURI SIDE OF THE STATE LINE AND WAS A NOTED PRO-SLAVERY STRONGHOLD
SHE HAD A STORE OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS WHICH FILLED A FOUR-HORSE WAGON BORROWED OF RALPH GRUME THOMAS LINCOLN'S BROTHER-IN-LAW TO TRANSPORT THE BRIDE TO INDIANA
BUT FORTUNATELY WE HAVE EVIDENCE WHICH CANNOT BE GAINSAID OF THE JUSTICE OF ITS SENTIMENTS AND THE WISDOM OF ITS PREDICTIONS
NO HE REPLIED MISTRUSTING HIS OWN FLUENCY
THOMASSON AND HENRY GRIDER WHIGS FROM KENTUCKY VOTED AGAINST KILLING THE AMENDED BILL IN ALL NINETY-THREE
HE HAD SEEMED TO REGAIN ALL HIS POPULARITY BY THE PROMPT AND FRANK SUPPORT WHICH HE GAVE TO THE CANDIDACY OF HARRISON
THE CONSPIRATORS HAD ALREADY SPENT SOME MONTHS IN ORGANIZING THEIR BLUE LODGES AND NOW DESIRED AT ONCE TO CONTROL THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE TERRITORY
AFTER LINCOLN WAS RELIEVED OF THE WEIGHT OF DIGNITY INVOLVED IN HIS CAPTAINCY THE WAR BECAME A SORT OF HOLIDAY AND THE TALL PRIVATE FROM NEW SALEM ENJOYED IT AS MUCH AS ANY ONE
SINCE 1849 AND 1850 WHEN THE GOLD FEVER WAS AT ITS HEIGHT EMIGRATION ACROSS THE PLAINS HAD SLACKENED AND THE EAGERNESS FOR A REVIVAL OF THIS LOCAL TRAFFIC UNDOUBTEDLY EXERTED ITS INFLUENCE IN PROCURING THE OPENING OF THE TERRITORIES IN 1854
BUT SUPPORTED BY MONEY SAW-MILLS PRINTING-PRESSES BOARDING-HOUSES THEY BECAME FROM THE VERY FIRST A COMPACT SELF-RELIANT GOVERNING FORCE
SHIELDS WAS A MAN OF INORDINATE VANITY AND A CORRESPONDING IRASCIBILITY
THE SUDDEN CHANGE
SOMETIMES HE DISTURBED THE COURT WITH LAUGHTER BY HIS HUMOROUS OR APT ILLUSTRATIONS
IT IS TRUE THAT TEXAS CLAIMED THE EASTERN BANK OF THE RIO GRANDE FROM ITS SOURCE TO ITS MOUTH
THE WESTERLY BANK OF THE SABINE RIVER FROM ITS MOUTH TO THE 32D DEGREE OF LONGITUDE WEST FROM GREENWICH
AFTER THE LAPSE OF MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY THE CRITICAL READER STILL FINDS IT A MODEL OF BREVITY DIRECTNESS TERSE DICTION EXACT AND LUCID HISTORICAL STATEMENT AND FULL OF LOGICAL PROPOSITIONS SO SHORT AND SO STRONG AS TO RESEMBLE MATHEMATICAL AXIOMS
LIGHT WAS THEIR MEASURED FOOTSTEPS WHEN THEY MOVED TO SEEK THE FOE
AND WE NOT ONLY ASSERT THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE FREE STATES OUGHT NOT TO SUBMIT TO IT BUT WE SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THEY WOULD NOT SUBMIT TO IT TO MEN IN A TEMPER LIKE THAT INDICATED BY THESE WORDS NO ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM CONSIDERATION OF POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY COULD BE EXPECTED TO HAVE ANY WEIGHT AND IT WAS OF NO USE TO SAY TO THEM THAT IN VOTING FOR A THIRD CANDIDATE THEY WERE VOTING TO ELECT MR POLK THE AVOWED AND EAGER ADVOCATE OF ANNEXATION
HE MADE HIS COMBINATIONS DURING THE WINTER AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE LOYAL ATTITUDE OF KEOKUK HE COULD HAVE BROUGHT THE ENTIRE NATION OF THE SACS AND FOXES TO THE WAR-PATH
AND UNTIL I DO I CANNOT TRUST MYSELF IN ANY MATTER OF MUCH IMPORTANCE
SHIELDS HOWEVER HAD TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT THE MATTER THAT HE NOW FELT IMPERATIVELY CALLED UPON TO ACT AND HE THEREFORE SENT GENERAL WHITESIDES TO DEMAND FROM THE JOURNAL THE NAME OF ITS CONTRIBUTOR
MR JOHNSON WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN A MISSOURI SLAVEHOLDER WAS AT THE MARCH ELECTION CHOSEN A MEMBER OF THE TERRITORIAL COUNCIL WHICH IN DUE TIME MADE HIM ITS PRESIDING OFFICER
HE ENTERED UPON THE LARGER FIELD OF WORK WHICH NOW LAY BEFORE HIM WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL DIFFIDENCE BUT EQUALLY WITHOUT ELATION
THEY WERE N
THEY ATTENDED CHURCH HEARD THE SERMON WEPT AND PRAYED SHOUTED GOT UP AND FOUGHT AN HOUR AND THEN WENT BACK TO PRAYER JUST AS THE SPIRIT MOVED THEM THE CAMP-MEETING MAY BE SAID WITH NO IRREVERENT INTENTION TO HAVE BEEN THEIR PRINCIPAL MEANS OF INTELLECTUAL EXCITEMENT
IT HAD ITS ORIGIN PARTLY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR LIVES THE SEVERE AND DISMAL LONELINESS IN WHICH THEIR STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE FOR THE MOST PART WENT ON
HOWELL THE MENTION OF THIS LAST POST-OFFICE ROUSES HIS RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION AND HE CALLS FOR JUSTICE UPON A WRONG-DOER
THEY HAD VOTED IT IS TRUE AGAINST THE IMPORTATION OF SLAVES FROM THE SOUTH BUT THEY WERE CONTENT TO LIVE UNDER A CODE OF DRACONIAN FEROCITY INSPIRED BY THE VERY SPIRIT OF SLAVERY VISITING THE IMMIGRATION OF FREE NEGROES WITH PENALTIES OF THE MOST SAVAGE DESCRIPTION
WHEN THE COMMISSIONERS CAME TO DECIDE ON THE RELATIVE MERITS OF SPRINGFIELD AND ANOTHER SITE A FEW MILES AWAY THEY LED THEM THROUGH BRAKE THROUGH BRIER BY MUD KNEE-DEEP AND BY WATER-COURSES SO EXASPERATING THAT THE WEARIED AND BAFFLED OFFICIALS DECLARED THEY WOULD SEEK NO FURTHER AND SPRINGFIELD BECAME THE COUNTY-SEAT FOR ALL TIME
HIS PARTNER MR HERNDON RELATES A SPEECH IN POINT WHICH LINCOLN ONCE MADE TO A MAN WHO OFFERED HIM AN OBJECTIONABLE CASE
HE THEN ASKS HOW UNDER ANY LAW HUMAN OR DIVINE THIS CAN BE CONSIDERED NO AGGRESSION AND CLOSES BY ASKING HIS CLERICAL CORRESPONDENT IF THE PRECEPT WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU DO YOU EVEN SO TO THEM IS OBSOLETE OF NO FORCE OF NO APPLICATION
RUNS AS A WHIG
HE BECAME FROM THAT MOMENT IN A CERTAIN SENSE A PERSONAGE WITH A NAME AND STANDING OF HIS OWN
ATCHISON HOWEVER DID NOT FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE
THE COMMONEST OCCURRENCES WERE HERALDS OF DEATH AND DOOM
THE ADVANTAGE MORALLY WAS ALTOGETHER AGAINST HIM
THEIR NAMES WERE ABRAHAM LINCOLN JOHN DAWSON DAN STONE NINIAN W
WHEREVER THE WORD STATE OCCURS IN ANY ACT OF THE PRESENT LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OR ANY LAW OF THIS TERRITORY IN SUCH CONSTRUCTION AS TO INDICATE THE LOCALITY OF THE OPERATION OF SUCH ACT OR LAWS THE SAME SHALL IN EVERY INSTANCE BE TAKEN AND UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN TERRITORY AND SHALL APPLY TO THE TERRITORY OF KANSAS STATUTES OF KANSAS 1855 P
ONE OF THE MANY FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS CATEGORY WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PERMANENT TERRITORIAL CAPITAL AUTHORIZED BY THE ORGANIC ACT WHERE THE LIBERAL FEDERAL APPROPRIATION FOR PUBLIC BUILDINGS SHOULD BE EXPENDED
HIS PARAMOUNT INTEREST IN THESE CANVASSES NECESSARILY PREVENTED HIM FROM SETTING TO HIS JUNIOR PARTNER THE EXAMPLE WHICH LINCOLN SO GREATLY NEEDED OF CLOSE AND STEADY DEVOTION TO THEIR PROFESSION
PEACE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BEEN IRKSOME TO HIM BUT A PEACE WHICH FORBADE HIM FREE ACCESS TO HIS OWN HUNTING-GROUNDS AND TO THE GRAVES OF HIS FATHERS WAS MORE THAN HE COULD NOW SCHOOL HIMSELF TO ENDURE
THERE WERE SEVERAL AUXILIARY SOCIETIES AND A FEW INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATIONS
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE 3 RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END YET THERE WAS A WELL-NIGH UNIVERSAL IMPRESSION AMONG THE ANTISLAVERY WHIGS THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE UNDER INFLUENCES FAVORABLE TO THE RESTRICTION OF SLAVERY
BUT THE REPORT DOES NOT COME IN VERY AUTHENTIC FORM SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN
POPULATION WAS SPARSE AND SOCIETY SCARCELY ORGANIZED LAND WAS PLENTIFUL AND EMPLOYMENT ABUNDANT
IN THE SLAVE STATES THE OPPOSITION TO THE ADMINISTRATION DARED NOT RAISE THE ANTI-NEBRASKA BANNER NOR COULD IT HAVE FOUND FOLLOWERS
BUT A GRASSY SOLITUDE STRETCHED FROM GALENA TO CHICAGO AND THE UPPER HALF OF THE STATE WAS GENERALLY A WILDERNESS
HIS BROTHER LEVI WAS ALSO AT THAT BATTLE AND WAS ONE OF THE FEW SURVIVORS OF IT
MR LINCOLN DID MORE THAN TOLERATE HIS CANDIDACY
HE WAS CONSTANTLY IN HIS SEAT HOWEVER AND VOTED GENERALLY WITH HIS PARTY AND ALWAYS WITH THOSE OPPOSED TO THE EXTENSION OF SLAVERY
FOR MYSELF SAID THE LATTER IN EXPLAINING THE TRANSACTION I AM ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO THE INTEREST OF THE SOUTH AND I WOULD SACRIFICE EVERYTHING BUT MY HOPE OF HEAVEN TO ADVANCE HER WELFARE HE THOUGHT THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE OUGHT TO BE REPEALED
IN THE FREE STATES THE CASE WAS ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT
HE RODE HASTILY INTO THE TOWN AND ARRIVED IN A FEW MINUTES AT HIS DESTINATION
THIS LATTER SET LOOSE ALL THE WINDS OF POPULAR FURY
I NEVER USE ANY MAN'S MONEY BUT MY OWN HE QUIETLY REMARKED
THEY MIGHT BE DEAF TO THE EQUALITIES PROCLAIMED IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OR BLIND TO THE MORAL SIN OF SLAVERY BUT THEY COMPREHENDED A RIFLE WHICH COULD BE FIRED TEN TIMES A MINUTE AND KILL A MAN AT A THOUSAND YARDS
HERE AGAIN AS IN THE HOUSE TEXAS STUBBORNLY OPPOSED IT
YET SHALL A GRATEFUL COUNTRY GIVE HER HONORS TO THEIR NAME
FOR A WHOLE YEAR HIS FAMILY LIVED IN THIS WRETCHED FOLD WHILE HE WAS CLEARING A LITTLE PATCH OF GROUND FOR PLANTING CORN AND BUILDING A ROUGH CABIN FOR A PERMANENT RESIDENCE
FOR I STAND HERE AFTER SIX MONTHS SERVICE AS A VOLUNTEER HAVING SEEN NO ACTUAL WARFARE IN THE FIELD YET EVEN THIS DISADVANTAGE HE TURNED WITH GREAT DEXTERITY TO HIS SERVICE
WITH THIS SLIGHT ADDITION TO THEIR RESOURCES THE FAMILY WERE MUCH IMPROVED IN APPEARANCE BEHAVIOR AND SELF-RESPECT
BUT IT CAME WITH A BAD GRACE FROM DOUGLAS WHO IN THE SAME REPORT INDORSED THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE AND SUSTAINED THE BOGUS LAWS UPON PURELY TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS
THE COURT WAS HELD IN A DOUBLE LOG CABIN THE GRAND JURY SAT UPON A LOG IN THE WOODS AND THE FOREMAN SIGNED THE BILLS OF INDICTMENT WHICH I HAD PREPARED UPON HIS KNEE
ESPECIALLY WAS THIS THE CASE AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE TREATY OF PEACE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO WHICH WAS SIGNED AT GUADALUPE HIDALGO ON THE 2D OF FEBRUARY AND WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE SENATE ONLY TWENTY DAYS LATER
CRIME CONTRE LA NATURE
DURING ALL THAT YEAR HE HUNTED FINDING EVERYWHERE ABUNDANCE OF GAME
ONE AGED MAN SAYS THAT HE HAS SEEN HIM PICK UP AND CARRY AWAY A CHICKEN-HOUSE WEIGHING SIX HUNDRED POUNDS
A MOB GATHERED THERE ON THE DAY HE CAME--IT WAS SUNDAY AND THE GOOD PEOPLE WERE AT LEISURE--AND THREW HIS PRESS INTO THE MISSISSIPPI
GRADUALLY AS THE PLOT WAS DEVELOPED THE AGREEMENT EMBRACED THE LEADING ELEMENTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN CONGRESS REENFORCED BY A MAJORITY OF THE WHIG LEADERS FROM THE SLAVE STATES
SINCE THE SOUTH PASS WAS IN 42 DEGREES 30 THE TERRITORY HAD TO EXTEND TO 43 DEGREES NORTH
BUT HE WAS CONFRONTED BY FORMIDABLE COMPETITION
THERE WAS NO RESOURCE BUT A PROTEST AND HERE AGAIN LINCOLN UTTERED THE VOICE OF THE CONSCIENCE OF THE PARTY
HE HAD BECOME INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED AT VANDALIA WITH WILLIAM BUTLER WHO WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN THE REMOVAL OF THE CAPITAL TO SPRINGFIELD AND WHO URGED THE YOUNG LEGISLATOR TO TAKE UP HIS RESIDENCE AT THE NEW SEAT OF GOVERNMENT
I HAVE WORKED HARD AND BEEN FRUGAL ALL MY LIFE AND THE RESULTS OF MY INDUSTRY HAVE MAINLY TAKEN THE FORM OF SLAVES OF WHOM I OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED
TO MOST ARMIES THIS WOULD HAVE SEEMED A SERIOUS OBSTACLE BUT THESE BACKWOODSMEN SWARMED TO THE WORK LIKE BEAVERS AND IN LESS THAN THREE HOURS THE RIVER WAS CROSSED WITH THE LOSS OF ONLY ONE OR TWO HORSES AND WAGONS
CAUSES THE REAL FRIENDS OF FREEDOM TO DOUBT OUR SINCERITY
STATESMEN OF A PREVIOUS GENERATION MUST GET OUT OF THE WAY
THIS SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS ENLIVENED BY A SINGULAR CONTEST BETWEEN THE WHIGS AND DEMOCRATS IN RELATION TO THE STATE BANKS
HE LOVED DISCUSSION LIKE A MEDIEVAL SCHOOLMAN
LINCOLN'S EXERTION IN LATER YEARS FOR THE WELFARE OF THE AFRICAN RACE SHOWED THAT THIS NOCTURNAL BATTLE HAD NOT LED HIM TO ANY HASTY AND HOSTILE GENERALIZATIONS
WHEN NINIAN EDWARDS WAS A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS IN 1826 HE WAS ONLY FIFTY-ONE AND YET HE CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY IN HIS PUBLISHED ADDRESSES TO REFER TO THE CHARGE THAT HE WAS TOO OLD FOR THE PLACE AND WHILE ADMITTING THE FACT THAT HE WAS NO LONGER YOUNG TO URGE IN EXTENUATION THAT THERE ARE SOME OLD THINGS,--LIKE OLD WHISKY OLD BACON AND OLD FRIENDS WHICH ARE NOT WITHOUT THEIR MERITS
THIS CASE WAS TO COME ON AT THE JUNE TERM IN 1840 AND THE DEMOCRATIC COUNSEL CHIEF AMONG WHOM WAS MR DOUGLAS WERE IN SOME ANXIETY AS AN UNFAVORABLE DECISION WOULD LOSE THEM ABOUT TEN THOUSAND ALIEN VOTES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER
HE WAS STILL AND FOR YEARS CONTINUED TO BE A VERY POOR MAN HARASSED BY DEBTS WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS WORKING TO PAY AND SOMETIMES IN DISTRESS FOR THE MEANS OF DECENT SUBSISTENCE
OF THESE GOOD THINGS WE ATE ALMOST IMMODERATELY FOR IT WAS THE ONLY WARM MEAL WE HAD MADE FOR SEVERAL DAYS
HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE NEW STUDY WITH THAT PECULIAR INTENSITY OF APPLICATION WHICH ALWAYS REMAINED HIS MOST VALUABLE FACULTY AND SOON KNEW ALL THAT CAN BE KNOWN ABOUT IT FROM RULES
HE DID ONE DAY'S WORK ACTING AS CLERK OF A LOCAL ELECTION A LETTERED LOAFER BEING PRETTY SURE OF EMPLOYMENT ON SUCH AN OCCASION
THERE WAS NOT A PETIT JUROR THAT HAD SHOES ON
THE WHIGS SAY THAT THE CANAL AND OTHER PUBLIC WORKS WILL STOP AND CONSEQUENTLY WE SHALL THEN BE CLEAR OF THE FOREIGN VOTES WHEREAS BY ANOTHER YEAR THEY MAY BE BROUGHT IN AGAIN
MATTESON HAD ASSUMED A QUASI-INDEPENDENT POSITION
THOMAS LINCOLN CONCLUDING THAT KENTUCKY WAS NO COUNTRY FOR A POOR MAN DETERMINED TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE IN INDIANA
AND OPPOSITION DARED ONLY TO MANIFEST ITSELF TO DEMOCRATIC PARTY ORGANIZATION--NOT TO THESE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEASURES
MARTIN VAN BUREN BUT THESE SUPREME EFFORTS OF THE ADVOCATES OF PUBLIC MORALS UNINFLUENCED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF PERSONAL ADVANTAGE ARE OF RARE OCCURRENCE AND NECESSARILY DO NOT SURVIVE THE EXIGENCIES THAT CALL THEM FORTH
WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ENACTED THAT EACH INHABITANT WHO HAD PAID HIS TERRITORIAL TAX SHOULD BE A QUALIFIED VOTER FOR ALL ELECTIVE OFFICERS
WHO WILL GO WITH HIM
INVOLVING NOT MERELY A POLICY OF GOVERNMENT BUT A QUESTION OF ABSTRACT MORALS STATESMEN PHILANTHROPISTS DIVINES THE PRESS SOCIETIES CHURCHES AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES JOINED IN THE DISCUSSION
MELANCHOLIA CHAPTER XI
HE GREW UP IN THE MIDST OF POVERTY AND IGNORANCE
THIS WORK CARRIED ON AND COMPLETED IN THE MONTHS OF JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 1855 DISCLOSED A TOTAL POPULATION OF 8601 SOULS OF WHOM 2905 WERE VOTERS
POLITICALLY THEY HAD BEEN OPPONENTS FOR TWENTY YEARS
LAMOU LIFE OF LINCOLN P
FOURTH WHETHER THAT SETTLEMENT IS OR IS NOT ISOLATED FROM ANY AND ALL OTHER SETTLEMENTS BY THE GULF AND THE RIO GRANDE ON THE SOUTH AND WEST AND BY WIDE UNINHABITED REGIONS IN THE NORTH AND EAST
THE HELP OF COLONEL SUMNER COMMANDING THE UNITED STATES TROOPS WAS FINALLY INVOKED BUT HIS INSTRUCTIONS ONLY PERMITTED HIM TO ACT AT THE CALL OF THE GOVERNOR OR MARSHAL
THE CLERK COPYING IT LOST THE PROPER SEQUENCE OF THE ENTRIES AND GAVE TO THE LINCOLNS THE DATE BELONGING TO THE NEXT COUPLE ON THE LIST WHILE LEARNING HIS TRADE IN THE CARPENTER SHOP OF JOSEPH HANKS IN ELIZABETHTOWN HE MARRIED NANCY HANKS A NIECE OF HIS EMPLOYER NEAR BEECHLAND IN WASHINGTON COUNTY
BUT IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO SAY THAT CAPTAIN LINCOLN WAS NOT ONE OF THESE HOMESICK SOLDIERS

LINCOLN'S CANDIDACY FOR THE SENATE
THE FREE COMMENTS OF THE NEIGHBORS ON THE FRACAS OR THE CHARACTER OF THE PARTIES WOULD BE PRODUCTIVE OF SLANDER SUITS
THESE WOULD NEVER DESERT ME EXCEPT BY MY DIRECTION
HE WROTE AND PUBLISHED WHAT WAS IN HIS HEART TO SAY AND ALTON WAS AGAIN VEHEMENTLY MOVED
SLAVERY WAS ASSAILED AND DEFENDED IN BEHALF OF THE WELFARE OF THE STATE AND IN THE NAME OF RELIGION
63 ALL THE REMAINDER WERE CITIZENS OF MISSOURI
THESE FESTIVITIES LASTED RARELY LESS THAN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
GOVERNOR REYNOLDS TELLS US OF A PREACHER IN SANGAMON COUNTY WHO BEFORE HIS SERMON HAD SET A WOLF-TRAP IN VIEW FROM HIS PULPIT
NOT A CENT OF MONEY CHANGED HANDS IN ALL THESE TRANSACTIONS
THOMAS LINCOLN MADE THE COFFINS FOR HIS DEAD OUT OF GREEN LUMBER CUT WITH A WHIPSAW AND THEY WERE ALL BURIED WITH SCANT CEREMONY IN A LITTLE CLEARING OF THE FOREST

THEY WERE MOSTLY A SIMPLE NEIGHBORLY UNAMBITIOUS PEOPLE CONTENTED WITH THEIR CONDITION LIVING UPON PLAIN FARE AND KNOWING NOT MUCH OF ANYTHING BETTER
ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SIMILARLY EMPLOYED CAN APPRECIATE THE SENSE OF INADEQUATE PERFORMANCE WITH WHICH WE REGARD WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
TRUMBULL ELECTED SENATOR
THIS WAS MR LINCOLN'S LAST PERSONAL QUARREL
KEEDER A MEMBER OF HIS OWN PARTY FROM THE FREE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA
BECAUSE IT WAS NOT PRECISELY LIKE THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE MARRIED AND GIVEN IN MARRIAGE EVERY DAY WITHOUT ANY ADO A DOZEN CONFLICTING STORIES HAVE GROWN UP MORE OR LESS FALSE AND INJURIOUS TO BOTH CONTRACTING PARTIES
HE HAD ALREADY RENDERED THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE THE IMPORTANT SERVICE OF PUBLISHING AN EXTRA-JUDICIAL OPINION SUSTAINING THEIR ADJOURNMENT FROM PAWNEE TO SHAWNEE MISSION
SAYS ONE WRITER HE BROUGHT LIGHT WITH HIM THIS IS NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND
NOT A FEW OF THE CABINS IN THE CLEARINGS WERE THE ABODE OF A FERVENT RELIGION AND AN AUSTERE MORALITY
IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO THOSE WHO SHALL READ THESE PAGES THAT A PROTEST SO MILD AND CAUTIOUS AS THIS SHOULD EVER HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED EITHER NECESSARY OR REMARKABLE
AS A BOY HE HAD INTERESTED HIMSELF IN THE DETAILS OF LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS OF RIVERS AND ROADS AND HE DOUBTLESS WENT WITH THE CURRENT IN VANDALIA IN FAVOR OF THIS ENORMOUS SYSTEM
THE NEXT MORNING WHILE RADFORD WAS RUEFULLY CONTEMPLATING THE RUIN AND DOUBTLESS CONCLUDING THAT HE HAD HAD ENOUGH OF A COUNTRY WHERE THE LOCAL IDEA OF NEIGHBORLY HUMOR FOUND SUCH ECCENTRIC EXPRESSION HE HAILED A PASSER-BY NAMED GREENE AND CHALLENGED HIM TO BUY HIS ESTABLISHMENT FOR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS
134 THIS TAINT OF CONSTITUTIONAL SADNESS WAS NOT PECULIAR TO LINCOLN
RADICAL SOUTHERN MEMBERS CONTENDED THAT CONGRESS HAD NO POWER TO IMPOSE ANY CONDITIONS ON NEW STATES
I AM NOT GOING BEYOND THE TRUTH WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THE SHORT SPACE IT TOOK ME TO READ YOUR LAST LETTER GAVE ME MORE PLEASURE THAN THE TOTAL SUM OF ALL I HAVE ENJOYED SINCE THE FATAL 1ST OF JANUARY 1841
HIS PROFESSION OF LAW HAD BECOME A DEEPER SCIENCE AND A HIGHER RESPONSIBILITY
IN THIS VASTLY MORE SERIOUS MATTER WHICH WAS WE MAY SAY AT ONCE THE CRUCIAL ORDEAL OF HIS LIFE THE SAME INVINCIBLE TRUTHFULNESS THE SAME INNATE GOODNESS THE SAME HORROR OF DOING A WRONG ARE COMBINED WITH AN EXQUISITE SENSIBILITY AND A CAPACITY FOR SUFFERING WHICH MARK HIM AS A MAN PICKED OUT AMONG TEN THOUSAND HIS HABIT OF RELENTLESS SELF-SEARCHING REVEALS TO HIM A STATE OF FEELING WHICH STRIKES HIM WITH DISMAY
IT IS SAID OF HIM WITH A GRAPHIC VARIATION OF A WELL-KNOWN TEXT THAT HE VISITED THE FATHERLESS AND THE WIDOW AND CHOPPED THEIR WOOD IN THE SPRING OF THIS YEAR 1833 HE WAS APPOINTED POSTMASTER OF NEW SALEM AND HELD THE OFFICE FOR THREE YEARS
WITH A POPULATION LIKE THIS THE TOWN HAD FROM THE BEGINNING A MORE SETTLED AND ORDERLY TYPE THAN WAS USUAL IN THE SOUTH AND WEST
BY DINT OF CONSTANT PRACTICE HE HAD ACQUIRED AN ADMIRABLY CLEAR AND SERVICEABLE HANDWRITING
CHAPTER XXI LINCOLN AND TRUMBULL SIDENOTE
HAVING NOTHING TO GAIN BY FURTHER CONCESSION HE ADHERED TO HIS ORIGINAL PLAN ISSUED HIS PROCLAMATION CONVENING THE LEGISLATURE AT PAWNEE ON THE FIRST MONDAY IN JULY AND IMMEDIATELY STARTED FOR WASHINGTON TO MAKE A DIRECT APPEAL TO PRESIDENT PIERCE
THE PREACHER MET THEM WITH AN UNDAUNTED FRONT AND TOLD THEM HE MUST DO HIS DUTY AS IT APPEARED TO HIM
I CAME OVER TO WASH THEM WE ARE AWARE THAT THESE STORIES DETRACT SOMETHING FROM THE CHARACTER OF THE LAWYER
THE WHOLE MATTER IN ITS BROADER ASPECTS IS PART OF THAT PERSISTENT STRUGGLE OF THE CENTURIES BETWEEN DESPOTISM AND INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM
APRIL 16 1855 THE QUESTION OF THE CERTIFICATES DISPOSED OF THE NEXT POINT OF INTEREST WAS TO DETERMINE AT WHAT PLACE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ASSEMBLE
EACH CONGRESS IN ORDINARY COURSE MEETS FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT ONE YEAR AFTER ITS MEMBERS ARE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AND THE INFLUENCE OF POLITICS DURING THE INTERIM NEEDS ALWAYS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
HE GIVES THE FOLLOWING LIST OF LANDS IN THAT STATE OWNED BY ABRAHAM LINCOLN
SIR
VICTORY OF THE FREE STATE PARTY
HIS CAREER AS A PREACHER BEGAN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY AND CONTINUED FOR SEVENTY YEARS
I HAVE BEEN SO BUSY THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN MRS STUART SINCE YOU LEFT THOUGH I UNDERSTAND SHE WROTE YOU BY TO-DAY'S MAIL WHICH WILL INFORM YOU MORE ABOUT HER THAN I COULD
THEY ALSO BELONGED TO THE COMMUNION OF FRIENDS.--"HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS OF GWYNNEDD BY H
THE FOLLOWING PROTEST WAS PRESENTED TO THE HOUSE WHICH WAS READ AND ORDERED TO BE SPREAD ON THE JOURNALS TO WIT
IT IS AN INTERESTING COINCIDENCE FOR THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH WE ARE INDEBTED TO COLONEL JOHN B
IN PURSUANCE OF THIS SYSTEM MICHIGAN AND ARKANSAS THE FORMER A FREE AND THE LATTER A SLAVE STATE WERE ON THE SAME DAY JUNE 15 1836 AUTHORIZED TO BE ADMITTED
THE CLIMAX OF THE WHOLE FOLLY WAS REACHED BY THE PROVISION OF LAW DIRECTING THAT WORK SHOULD BE BEGUN AT ONCE AT THE TERMINI OF ALL THE ROADS AND THE CROSSINGS OF ALL RIVERS
HIS PERSONAL AUTHORITY ACCOMPLISHED THIS IN GREAT PART
THAT SIGHT WAS A CONTINUAL TORMENT TO ME AND I SEE SOMETHING LIKE IT EVERY TIME I TOUCH THE OHIO OR ANY OTHER SLAVE BORDER
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE INVASION IN WESTERN MISSOURI CARRIED ON UNDER PRE-ACKNOWLEDGED LEADERSHIP IN POPULOUS COUNTIES AMONG ESTABLISHED HOMES AMID WELL-MATURED CONFIDENCE GROWING OUT OF LONG PERSONAL AND POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY EVEN WITHOUT THE POWERFUL BOND OF SECRET ASSOCIATION
AND THE RISE OF ENGLISH IMPORTS OF RAW COTTON FROM THIRTY MILLION POUNDS IN 1790 TO OVER ONE THOUSAND MILLION POUNDS IN 1860 SHOWS THE DEVELOPMENT AND INCREASE OF THIS SPECIAL INDUSTRY WITH ALL ITS RELATED INTERESTS
HE THEN OBTAINED HIS FIRST PUBLIC RECOGNITION AND ENTERED UPON THE COURSE OF LIFE WHICH WAS TO LEAD HIM TO A POSITION OF PROMINENCE AND GREAT USEFULNESS
THE PUBLIC OPINION OF THE COLONIES WAS ALREADY TOO MUCH DEBAUCHED TO SIT IN UNANIMOUS MORAL JUDGMENT ON THIS CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY
JEFFERSON DAVIS WHO WAS WITH THE ARMY IN MEXICO TO NOW STAND WHERE I DO AND TO RECEIVE FROM GENTLEMEN ON ALL SIDES THE CONGRATULATIONS SO JUSTLY DUE TO HIM AND TO LISTEN TO THE PRAISES OF HIS BRAVE COMPEERS
48 EVEN SUCH OFF-HAND REASONING WAS PROBABLY CONFINED TO THE MORE INTELLIGENT
SEC
THE SOUTHERN LEADERS HAD DETERMINED UPON THE IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL ANNEXATION OF TEXAS AND MR VAN BUREN'S VIEWS UPON THIS VITAL QUESTION WERE TOO MODERATE AND CONSERVATIVE TO SUIT THE ADVENTUROUS SPIRITS WHO MOST CLOSELY SURROUNDED PRESIDENT TYLER
INDUSTRY INSTEAD OF BEING STIMULATED ACTUALLY LANGUISHED
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE 3 RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM GIVING HIS OWN PARTY ALL THE CREDIT WHICH COULD BE CLAIMED FOR IT AND IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HOW EXASPERATING IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO THE MAJORITY TO HEAR SO CALM AN ASSUMPTION OF SUPERIOR PATRIOTISM ON THE PART OF THE OPPOSITION AS THE FOLLOWING
FUGITIVE SLAVES SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO THEIR OWNERS
MAKES A LODGMENT ON THE MISSISSIPPI
JACOB AND JOHN REMAINED IN VIRGINIA
IN THE EARLY PART OF JANUARY 1846 HARDIN WAS THE ONLY ONE WHOSE NAME WAS MENTIONED IN OPPOSITION TO LINCOLN
AND AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S DEATH AND THE TREACHERY OF TYLER HAD TURNED THE VICTORY OF THE WHIGS INTO DUST AND ASHES THE ENTIRE PARTY CAME BACK TO CLAY WITH PASSIONATE AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE TO LEAD THEM IN THE DESPERATE BATTLE WHICH PERHAPS NO MAN COULD HAVE WON
IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT OPINION WAS SO DIVIDED AMONG THESE FOUR THAT A NOMINATION COULD ONLY BE REACHED THROUGH LONG AND TEDIOUS BALLOTINGS
EMIGRATING FROM VERMONT TO THE WEST DOUGLAS HAD RUN A CAREER REMARKABLE FOR POLITICAL SUCCESS
THERE WERE FEW OTHER SOCIAL MEETINGS
IT WAS TRUMPETED ABROAD BY THE DEMOCRATIC NEWSPAPERS THAT IN THE ORDER-LOVING LAW-ABIDING ABOLITION-RIDDEN CITY OF CHICAGO ILLINOIS'S GREAT STATESMAN AND REPRESENTATIVE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE WAS CRIED DOWN AND REFUSED THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEAKING

BY FORCE OF THEIR ABILITY AND STANDING THEY HAD BEFORE MANAGED TO DIVIDE THE SUFFRAGES OF THE PEOPLE EVEN WHILE THEY WERE UNQUESTIONABLY IN THE MINORITY
WE HAVE STRIVEN TO BE EQUALLY JUST TO FRIENDS AND TO ADVERSARIES
A VISIT WAS A SERIOUS MATTER INVOLVING THE EXPENDITURE OF DAYS OF TRAVEL
HE HAD DONE HIS WORK AT THIS SESSION IN EFFECTING THE REMOVAL OF THE CAPITAL
AFTER THE FATAL BATTLE OF THE BLUE LICKS,--WHERE THE ONLY POINT OF LIGHT IN THE DAY'S TERRIBLE WORK WAS THE WISDOM AND VALOR WITH WHICH HE HAD PARTLY RETRIEVED A DISASTER HE FORESAW BUT WAS POWERLESS TO PREVENT,--WHEN IT BECAME HIS DUTY AS SENIOR SURVIVING OFFICER OF THE FORCES TO REPORT THE AFFAIR TO GOVERNOR HARRISON HIS DRY AND NAKED NARRATIVE GIVES NOT A SINGLE HINT OF WHAT HE HAD DONE HIMSELF NOR MENTIONS THE GALLANT SON LYING DEAD ON THE FIELD NOR THE WOUNDED BROTHER WHOSE GALLANTRY MIGHT JUSTLY HAVE CLAIMED SOME NOTICE
FOUR OF THE PRISONERS WERE CONVICTED OF MURDER AND THREE OF THEM HUNG FOR KILLING INDIANS
KING FROM MCKENNY HALL'S INDIAN TRIBES OF NORTH AMERICA STEPHEN T
A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THE FINAL INTRODUCTION OF THE REPEAL DOUGLAS AND OTHERS HELD AN INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT PIERCE TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE
HE WAS AT LAST CONVINCED THAT THE ELECTION OF MR CLAY WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HE THOUGHT HE COULD SEE THAT THE ONE OPPORTUNITY OF THE WHIGS WAS IN THE NOMINATION OF TAYLOR
THIS IS A STATEMENT WHICH OUGHT NOT TO BE MADE WITHOUT AUTHORITY AND RATHER THAN GIVE THE COMMON REPUTE OF THE CIRCUIT WE PREFER TO CITE THE OPINION OF THOSE LAWYERS OF ILLINOIS WHO ARE ENTITLED TO SPEAK AS TO THIS MATTER BOTH BY THE WEIGHT OF THEIR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL CHARACTER AND BY THEIR EMINENT OFFICIAL STANDING AMONG THE JURISTS OF OUR TIME
BUT THE PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST FOR THAT YEAR WAS PROVIDED FOR BY AN INGENIOUS EXPEDIENT WHICH SHIFTED UPON THE FUND COMMISSIONERS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DECIDING WHAT PORTION OF THE DEBT WAS LEGAL AND HOW MUCH INTEREST WAS THEREFORE TO BE PAID
STUART WHO IS OUR AUTHORITY FOR THIS STATEMENT ON THE GROUND THAT THE NEW TERRITORY WOULD SOON BE A STATE AND THAT HE COULD COME BACK AS A SENATOR
I ENJOYED FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS THE PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP OF MR LINCOLN
THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT REPEAL IT STOP WORK UPON THE VISIONARY ROADS AND ENDEAVOR TO INVENT SOME MEANS OF PAYING THE ENORMOUS DEBT
HE NEVER INTENTIONALLY MISREPRESENTED THE EVIDENCE OF A WITNESS NOR THE ARGUMENT OF AN OPPONENT
BERRY IN THE NAME OF BERRY AND LINCOLN HAVE LICENSE TO KEEP A TAVERN IN NEW SALEM TO CONTINUE TWELVE MONTHS FROM THIS DATE AND THAT THEY PAY ONE DOLLAR IN ADDITION TO SIX DOLLARS HERETOFORE PREPAID AS PER TREASURER'S RECEIPT AND THAT THEY BE ALLOWED THE FOLLOWING RATES VIZ

HITHERTO ITS AIMS HAD APPEARED UTOPIAN AND ITS RESOLVES HAD BEEN DENUNCIATORY AND EXASPERATING
BUT IN THE PLANS AND HOPES OF THE CONSPIRATORS THIS OF ITSELF WAS INSUFFICIENT
THEY WERE NOT MORE MAGNANIMOUS IN THEIR VICTORY THAN SCRUPULOUS IN THE MEANS BY WHICH THEY HAD GAINED IT
ADAIR FOR TRANSCRIPTS OF THE STATE RECORDS BEARING ON THIS MATTER NO REPORT REMAINS OF THE MANY SPEECHES WHICH PROLONGED THE DEBATE
THIS MAP GIVES THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES AS DEFINED BY THE TREATY OF 1828
THE POPULATION OF THE STATE HAD GROWN TO 157,447
THE VERY MOMENT A SPEAKER IS ELECTED WRITE ME WHO HE IS
BUT HE SOON FOUND HIMSELF IN DIFFERENT HANDS FROM ANY HE HAD HERETOFORE ENGAGED WITH
A FRESHENING BREEZE FILLED THE SAILS OF ANNEXATION AND MANIFEST DESTINY IN BOLD WORDS THE PRESIDENT SAID
LINCOLN CHALLENGED
ON THE OTHER HAND MR CLAY'S CAUTIOUS AND MODERATE POSITION DID HIM IRREPARABLE HARM AMONG THE ARDENT OPPONENTS OF SLAVERY
ANOTHER DINNER WAS GIVEN THEM AT ATHENS A FEW WEEKS LATER
IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT I MAY BECOME PERMANENTLY ODIOUS AMONG THOSE WHOSE FRIENDSHIP AND ESTEEM I HAVE HERETOFORE POSSESSED
PROVIDED THAT AS AN EXPRESS AND FUNDAMENTAL CONDITION TO THE ACQUISITION OF ANY TERRITORY FROM THE REPUBLIC OF MEXICO BY THE UNITED STATES BY VIRTUE OF ANY TREATY THAT MAY BE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THEM AND TO THE USE BY THE EXECUTIVE OF THE MONEYS HEREIN APPROPRIATED NEITHER SLAVERY NOR INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE SHALL EXIST IN ANY PART OF SAID TERRITORY EXCEPT FOR CRIME WHEREOF THE PARTY SHALL FIRST BE DULY CONVICTED
SHOULD ALL THIS SECURITY BE SWEPT AWAY AND THEIR RUNAWAYS FIND A FREE ROUTE TO CANADA BY SIMPLY CROSSING THE COUNTY LINE
WHILE THE GOVERNOR'S PROCLAMATION SPOKE OF SERVING WRITS THE NOTICES OF THE CONSPIRATORS SOUNDED THE NOTE OF THE REAL CONTEST
BUT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN RESOLVED IN THE INNER COUNCILS OF THE PARTY THAT HE SHOULD BE DEFEATED
BUT ON THE 26TH LINCOLN HAD SO FAR RECOVERED HIS SELF POSSESSION AS TO RESUME HIS PLACE IN THE HOUSE AND THE LEADERSHIP OF HIS PARTY
IN 1844 IT IS TRUE HE WAS NO LONGER YOUNG AND HIS POWER MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN ON THE DECLINE

IT SEEMS THAT THIS MALADY OF THEIR HEELS OPERATES ON THE SOUND-HEADED AND HONEST-HEARTED CREATURES VERY MUCH AS THE CORK LEG IN THE COMIC SONG DID ON ITS OWNER WHICH WHEN HE ONCE GOT STARTED ON IT THE MORE HE TRIED TO STOP IT THE MORE IT WOULD RUN AWAY
THOMAS APRIL 4 1853
THE WHIGS OF THE SOUTH WERE THEREFORE DRIVEN PRECIPITATELY TO DIVISION
AMONG THE MOST AMUSING FACTS HE BROUGHT FORWARD WAS THAT WHITESIDES BEING A FUND COMMISSIONER OF THE STATE RAN THE RISK OF LOSING HIS OFFICE BY ENGAGING IN A DUEL
AN ACT LEGALIZING A SORT OF SLAVERY BY INDENTURE WAS PASSED BY THE INDIANA TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE IN 1807 AND THIS REMAINED IN FORCE IN THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY AFTER ITS SEPARATION
THE EASTERN PEOPLE HAD CAUGHT THE MANIA
BY A SORT OF COMMON CONSENT HIS PARTY LOOKED TO HIM TO ANSWER DOUGLAS'S SPEECH
NO ONE DARED TO RESIST THE ACTS OF THE INVADERS SINCE THEY WERE ARMED AND COMMANDED IN FRONTIER IF NOT IN MILITARY FASHION IN MANY CASES BY MEN WHOSE NAMES THEN OR AFTER-WARDS WERE PROMINENT OR NOTORIOUS

SCOTT AND WEBSTER HAD EACH A FEW VOTES
IN THE MIDST OF HIS EXHORTATIONS HIS KEEN EYES SAW THE DISTANT TRAP COLLAPSE AND HE CONTINUED IN THE SAME INTONATION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN PREACHING MIND THE TEXT BRETHREN TILL I GO KILL THAT WOLF WITH ALL THE FAILINGS AND ECCENTRICITIES OF THIS SINGULAR CLASS OF MEN THEY DID A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD AND ARE ENTITLED TO ESPECIAL CREDIT AMONG THOSE WHO CONQUERED THE WILDERNESS
IN REGARD TO OTHER POLITICAL QUESTIONS HIS POSITION WAS SO UNDEFINED AND HIS SILENCE GENERALLY SO DISCREET THAT FEW OF THE WHIGS HOWEVER EXACTING COULD FIND ANY DIFFICULTY IN SUPPORTING HIM
THE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS WERE TO BE HELD IN THE AUTUMN AND THE SUCCESSION OF EVENTS RATHER THAN THE LEADERSHIP OF POLITICIANS GRADUALLY SHAPED THE CAMPAIGN
THE FACT IS NOT SINGULAR IF WE REMEMBER THE PECULIAR SITUATION OF THAT LOCALITY
THIS PHRASE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AS A FORMULA BY THE ANTI-JACKSON PARTY
HE OCCASIONALLY ASTOUNDED HIS COMPANIONS BY SUCH GLIMPSES OF OCCULT SCIENCE AS THAT THE WORLD IS ROUND AND THAT THE SUN IS RELATIVELY STATIONARY
WE HOPE NO ONE WILL BE SILLY ENOUGH TO SUPPOSE THE GOVERNOR HAS POWER TO COMPEL US TO STAY AT PAWNEE DURING THE ENTIRE SESSION
THE GRATEFUL SOT HIMSELF ALWAYS SAID IT WAS MIGHTY CLEVER OF ABE TO TOTE ME SO FAR THAT COLD NIGHT IT WAS ALSO CONSIDERED AN ECCENTRICITY THAT HE HATED AND PREACHED AGAINST CRUELTY TO ANIMALS
DEBATES ON THE WAR
TO FURTHER ENLIST HIS ZEAL IN THEIR BEHALF A FEW WEEKS LATER THEY FORMALLY ORGANIZED A LAW-AND-ORDER PARTY BY A LARGE PUBLIC MEETING HELD AT LEAVENWORTH
HIS REPUTATION FOR STRENGTH AND ACTIVITY WAS A GREATER PROTECTION TO HIM THAN HIS INOFFENSIVE GOOD-NATURE
A CONVENTION OF TEXANS WAS CALLED FOR THE 4TH OF JULY TO CONSIDER THE AMERICAN PROPOSITIONS
BE VERY SURE TO SEND ME THE SENATE JOURNAL OF NEW YORK FOR SEPTEMBER 1814,"--HE HAD SEEN IN A NEWSPAPER A CHARGE OF DISLOYALTY MADE AGAINST MR VAN BUREN DURING THE WAR WITH GREAT BRITAIN BUT AS USUAL WANTED TO BE SURE OF HIS FACTS,--"AND IN GENERAL HE ADDS SEND ME EVERYTHING YOU THINK WILL BE A GOOD WAR-CLUB THE NOMINATION OF HARRISON TAKES FIRST-RATE
WITH THIS ENUMERATION AS A DEFINITE GUIDE THE GOVERNOR MADE AN APPORTIONMENT ESTABLISHED ELECTION DISTRICTS AND APPOINTING THE NECESSARY OFFICERS TO CONDUCT IT FIXED UPON THE 30TH OF MARCH 1855 AS THE DAY FOR ELECTING THE TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE
THE LAWYERS IN HUNTING-SHIRTS AND MOCASSINS HAD LONG SINCE PASSED AWAY

BOONE'S EXPLORATION OF KENTUCKY HAD BEGUN SOME TEN YEARS BEFORE LINCOLN SET OUT TO FOLLOW HIS TRAIL
BUT THROUGHOUT THEIR LONG AND PERSISTENT NON-CONFORMITY FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS THEY CONSTANTLY AND CHEERFULLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE AUTHORITY OF THE ORGANIC ACT AND OF THE LAWS OF CONGRESS AND EVEN COUNSELED AND ENDURED EVERY FORCED SUBMISSION TO THE BOGUS LAWS
FORTIFIED WITH THIS IMPORTANT ADHESION DOUGLAS TOOK THE FATAL PLUNGE AND ON JANUARY 23 INTRODUCED HIS THIRD NEBRASKA BILL ORGANIZING TWO TERRITORIES INSTEAD OF ONE AND DECLARING THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE INOPERATIVE BUT THE AMENDMENT--MONSTROUS CALIBAN OF LEGISLATION AS IT WAS--NEEDED TO BE STILL FURTHER LICKED INTO SHAPE TO SATISFY THE DESIGNS OF THE SOUTH AND APPEASE THE ALARMED CONSCIENCE OF THE NORTH
HIS SUCCESSES WERE HARDLY PURCHASED BY LABORIOUS AFFABILITY
COTTON AND THE COTTON-GIN

BUT THE TWO MEN UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER AND THE SERVICE THUS RENDERED WAS GRATEFULLY RECEIVED AND REMEMBERED BY SPEED ALL HIS LIFE
AND THEREFORE FIFTH THE OHIO RIVER WAS DOUBTLESS THOUGHT TO BE A FAIR AND EQUITABLE DIVIDING LINE
LOGAN NOMINATED FOR CONGRESS AND DEFEATED
MAY 30 1854 THE PASSAGE OF THE NEBRASKA BILL AND THE HURRIED EXTINCTION OF THE INDIAN TITLE OPENED NEARLY FIFTEEN MILLION ACRES OF PUBLIC LANDS TO SETTLEMENT AND PURCHASE
MEMORIAL TO THE PRESIDENT IF WE WOULD BELIEVE THE CHIEF ACTORS THIS WAS THE LAW AND ORDER PARTY EXECUTING THE MANDATES OF JUSTICE
AND MORE THAN THIS YOU HAVE HAD THE SERVICES THE BLOOD AND THE LIVES OF OUR POLITICAL BRETHREN IN EVERY TRIAL AND ON EVERY FIELD
ON THE 2D OF JULY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE MET AT THE TOWN OF PAWNEE WHERE HE HAD CONVOKED THEM--A MAGNIFICENT PRAIRIE SITE BUT CONTAINING AS YET ONLY THREE BUILDINGS ONE TO HOLD SESSIONS IN AND TWO TO FURNISH FOOD AND LODGING
TO ASK IN A NOMINATING CONVENTION WHO IS BEST QUALIFIED FOR SERVICE IN CONGRESS IS ALWAYS REGARDED AS AN IMPERTINENCE
IT REFUSED TO MODIFY IT IN THE LEAST AND VOTED AS IF IN BRAVADO ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EXTEND IT
THE EMOTIONS THEY EXCITED DID NOT ALL DIE AWAY IN THE SHOUTS AND CONTORTIONS OF THE MEETING
BUT REGARDING HIS TATTERED BUCKSKIN AS UNFIT FOR THE GARB OF A LAWGIVER HE AND HIS SONS GATHERED HAZELNUTS ENOUGH TO BARTER AT THE NEAREST STORE FOR A FEW YARDS OF BLUE STROUDING SUCH AS THE INDIANS USED FOR BREECH CLOUTS
THIS EVENING JANUARY 11 OUR WHOLE MESS REMAINED IN THE DINING-ROOM AFTER TEA AND CONVERSED UPON THE SUBJECT OF MR LINCOLN'S BILL TO ABOLISH SLAVERY
ALL THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE OPEN HONEST AND LAWFUL CAREFULLY AVOIDING EVEN THE IMPLICATION OF MORAL OR POLITICAL WRONG
WHEN HE CAME HOME WITH HIS PURCHASE AND HAD CALLED TOGETHER THE WOMEN OF THE SETTLEMENT TO MAKE HIS CLOTHES IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE WAS ONLY MATERIAL ENOUGH FOR A VERY SHORT COAT AND A LONG PAIR OF LEGGINS AND THUS ATTIRED HE WENT TO KASKASKIA THE TERRITORIAL CAPITAL
THE NEIGHBORS WOULD LEND A HAND IN BUILDING A CABIN FOR A NEW-COMER
CHAPTER III ILLINOIS IN 1830 SIDENOTE
ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM WERE HIMSELF AND HIS ARMED ADHERENTS
LETTER FROM RICHARD V
ONLY TWO OR THREE OTHER MEMBERS TOOK PART IN THE DISCUSSION
WHILE PREPARING IT AND AFTER DINNER LINCOLN ENTERTAINED THEM AND THEY ENTERTAINED US FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS VERY AMUSINGLY KINDLY HUMAN COMPANIONSHIP WAS A LUXURY IN THAT GREEN WILDERNESS AND WAS READILY APPRECIATED AND PAID FOR
HE DID NOT RELAX HIS VIGILANCE FOR A MOMENT UNTIL AFTER HARDIN WITHDREW
THE GENERAL HAS ALREADY ENROLLED HIMSELF AS THE FIRST VOLUNTEER FROM ILLINOIS UNDER THE REQUISITION
HOWARD REPORT BEYOND THIS INITIATORY STEP THEY DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE HAD ANY PERSONAL PARTICIPATION IN IT AND ITS OFFICE AND WORKING OPERATIONS WERE SOON TRANSFERRED TO NEW YORK
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF THIS TERRITORY IN NEW CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN TROD BY THE FOOT OF NO CIVILIZED BEING
THEY WOULD NOT ENLIST WITH THEM BUT THEY WOULD FIGHT THEIR BATTLES IN THEIR OWN WAY
UPON EVERY ISSUE BUT THE NEBRASKA BILL TRUMBULL STILL AVOWED HIMSELF AN UNCOMPROMISING DEMOCRAT
AUGUST 23 1843 BUT LEAVING OUT OF VIEW THIS SPECIAL SUBJECT OF ADMITTED DISPUTE THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT HAD WARNED OUR OWN IN SUFFICIENTLY FORMAL TERMS THAT ANNEXATION COULD NOT BE PEACEFULLY EFFECTED
THERE WAS ALREADY A NORTH AND A SOUTH
THEY WERE ASSISTED IT IS TRUE BY THE FACT THAT THE LEADING WHIGS OF THE STATE VOLUNTEERED WITH THE UTMOST ALACRITY AND PROMPTITUDE IN THE MILITARY SERVICE
THE DAMAGE WAS IRRETRIEVABLE
IT WAS FORTUNATE FOR MR LINCOLN AND FOR WHIGS LIKE HIM WITH CONSCIENCES THAT GENERAL TAYLOR HAD OCCUPIED SO UNEQUIVOCAL AN ATTITUDE IN REGARD TO THE WAR
ALSO SOME ONE HAS BEEN TAMPERING WITH OLD SQUIRE WYCKOFF AND INDUCED HIM TO SEND IN HIS NAME TO BE ANNOUNCED AS A CANDIDATE
I RECOMMEND THAT WILLIAM BUTLER BE APPOINTED PENSION AGENT FOR THE ILLINOIS AGENCY WHEN THE PLACE SHALL BE VACANT
LOGAN RAPIDLY GAINED A GREAT REPUTATION AND ACCUMULATED AN AMPLE FORTUNE
AND LINCOLN ALTHOUGH NO LONGER IN HIS FIRST YOUTH BEING THEN THIRTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE HAD NOT YET FORMED THOSE HABITS OF CLOSE APPLICATION WHICH ARE INDISPENSABLE TO PERMANENT SUCCESS AT THE BAR
SO THAT IT IS REMARKED BY THOSE WHO STUDY THE EARLY STATUTES OF ILLINOIS THAT THEY ARE FAR BETTER DRAWN UP AND BETTER EDITED THAN THOSE OF A LATER PERIOD WHEN ILLITERATE TRICKSTERS CONSCIOUS OF THE PARTY STRENGTH BEHIND THEM INSISTED ON SHAPING LEGISLATION ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN FANCY
MR WATKINS LEIGH HAD THE HONOR OF PRESENTING HIS NAME A WORD HE SAID THAT EXPRESSED MORE ENTHUSIASM THAT HAD IN IT MORE ELOQUENCE THAN THE NAMES OF CHATHAM BURKE PATRICK HENRY AND HE CONTINUED RISING TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE OCCASION TO US MORE THAN ANY OTHER AND ALL OTHER NAMES TOGETHER NOTHING WAS LEFT TO BE SAID AND CLAY WAS NOMINATED WITHOUT A BALLOT
I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORST IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY 29 A COMPANY OF DRAGOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PRO-SLAVERY MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIES TO LECOMPTON IN THE CHARGE OF OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY
AMONG THE PIONEERS OF PIGEON CREEK SO ILL-FED ILL-HOUSED AND UNCARED FOR THERE WAS LITTLE PROSPECT OF RECOVERY FROM SUCH A GRAVE DISORDER
MEN WERE VOTED FOR TO A GREAT EXTENT INDEPENDENTLY OF PARTISAN QUESTIONS AFFECTING THE NATION AT LARGE AND IN THIS WAY THE HIGHER OFFICES OF THE STATE WERE FILLED FOR MANY YEARS BY MEN WHOSE PERSONAL CHARACTER COMPELLED THE RESPECT AND ESTEEM OF THE CITIZENS
THE PIERCE ADMINISTRATION UNDER THE DOMINATION OF THE SOUTHERN STATES HAD DEPOSED GOVERNOR REEDER
THE PARTNERSHIP CONTINUED ABOUT FOUR YEARS BUT THE BENEFIT LINCOLN DERIVED FROM IT LASTED ALL HIS LIFE
IN JULY A RATHER REMARKABLE DISCUSSION TOOK PLACE AT THE COUNTY-SEAT IN WHICH MANY OF THE LEADING MEN ON BOTH SIDES TOOK PART
IN A LETTER TO THE REV
THE INFIRMITIES OF THE JURY SYSTEM GAVE THEM LESS ANNOYANCE THAN THEY GIVE US
HUNDREDS OF OTHER BOYS BORN IN LOG-CABINS HAD WON SIMILAR ELEVATION IN THE MANLY PRACTICAL SCHOOL OF WESTERN PUBLIC LIFE
THE PRO-SLAVERY MAJORITY IN THAT BODY HELD FIRMLY TOGETHER TILL NEAR THE CLOSE OF THE SESSION WHEN THEY ATTEMPTED TO BRING IN THE NEW TERRITORIES WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION AS TO SLAVERY BY ATTACHING WHAT IS CALLED A RIDER TO THAT EFFECT TO THE CIVIL APPROPRIATION BILL
HIS NAME DOES NOT OFTEN APPEAR IN THE RECORDS OF THE YEAR
IF EVER I SHOULD CONCLUDE TO DOFF WHATEVER OUR DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS MAY SUPPOSE THERE IS OF BLACK-COCKADE FEDERALISM ABOUT ME AND THEREUPON THEY SHALL TAKE ME UP AS THEIR CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY I PROTEST THAT THEY SHALL NOT MAKE FUN OF ME AS THEY HAVE OF GENERAL CASS BY ATTEMPTING TO WRITE ME INTO A MILITARY HERO RELOCATED FOOTNOTE
WHETHER THESE TRADITIONS ARE STRICTLY TRUE OR NOT THEY ARE EVIDENTLY FOUNDED ON THE CURRENT REPUTATION HE ENJOYED AMONG HIS FELLOWS FOR EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH AND THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN HIS INFLUENCE
THERE WAS DOUBT AND CONSTERNATION OVER THE NEW ISSUE
CROSSING THE RIVER-FERRIES FROM THE UPPER COUNTIES AND PASSING UNOBSTRUCTED OVER THE STATE LINE BY THE PRAIRIE ROADS AND TRAILS FROM THE LOWER MANY OF THEM CAMPED THAT NIGHT AT THE NEAREST POLLS WHILE OTHERS PUSHED ON FIFTY OR A HUNDRED MILES TO THE SPARSELY SETTLED ELECTION DISTRICTS OF THE INTERIOR
WE FIND HIM MENTIONED IN THE COUNTY PAPER ONLY ONCE DURING THE SUMMER IN AN EDITORIAL NOTE ADDING THE NAME OF CAPTAIN LINCOLN TO THOSE CANDIDATES FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHO WERE PERILING THEIR LIVES ON THE FRONTIER AND HAD LEFT THEIR REPUTATIONS IN CHARGE OF THEIR GENEROUS FELLOW-CITIZENS AT HOME
IF NO RESISTANCE HAS BEEN MADE BUT COMBINATIONS FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESISTING THEM THEN MUST YOU STILL FIND BILLS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE TREASON AS THE COURTS HAVE DECIDED THAT THE BLOW NEED NOT BE STRUCK BUT ONLY THE INTENTION BE MADE EVIDENT FOOTNOTE

AND AS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON TERRITORIES WAS THE RECIPIENT OF ALL THE LETTERS PETITIONS AND PERSONAL SOLICITATIONS FROM THE VARIOUS INTERESTS WHICH WERE SEEKING THEIR ADVANTAGE IN THIS EXODUS TOWARD THE SETTING SUN

I AWFULLY FOREBODE I SHALL NOT
THE COUNTRY ABOUT PIGEON CREEK WAS LITERALLY DEVASTATED BY THE TERRIBLE MALADY CALLED MILK SICKNESS WHICH CARRIED AWAY HIS MOTHER AND HALF HER FAMILY

AND BY THESE MISREPRESENTATIONS THE WHOLE BORDER WAS WROUGHT UP INTO THE FERVOR OF A PRO-SLAVERY CRUSADE
THEY WERE CARELESS OF HUMAN LIFE BECAUSE LIFE WAS WORTH COMPARATIVELY LITTLE IN THAT HARD STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE
ON THE OCCASION OF HIS SPEAKING AT SPRINGFIELD MOST OF THE CANDIDATES HAD COME TOGETHER TO ADDRESS A MEETING THERE TO GIVE THEIR ELECTORS SOME IDEA OF THEIR QUALITY
AND NOTHING WAS MORE COMMON THAN CONCERTED NEIGHBORHOOD EFFORTS FOR IMPROVEMENT PROTECTION OR AMUSEMENT
HIS CABIN WAS LIKE THAT OF OTHER PIONEERS
HE WAS THE ARBITER ON ALL CONTROVERTED POINTS OF LITERATURE SCIENCE OR WOODCRAFT AMONG THE DISPUTATIOUS DENIZENS OF CLARY'S GROVE AND HIS DECISIONS WERE NEVER APPEALED FROM
HE WASTED NO TIME IN PRELIMINARIES BUT PROMPTLY MADE HIS WISHES KNOWN AND THE NEXT MORNING THEY WERE MARRIED
A FORTUNATE ESCAPE INDEPENDENT ACTION OF NORTHERN DEMOCRATS
SEVERAL PLAUSIBLE REASONS ARE ASSIGNED WHY THE THREE SLAVE STATES OF MARYLAND VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA VOTED FOR THIS PROHIBITION
THEIR SHOES WERE OF THE SAME AND A GOOD WESTERN AUTHORITY CALLS A WET MOCCASIN A DECENT WAY OF GOING BAREFOOT ABOUT THE TIME HOWEVER WHEN LINCOLN GREW TO MANHOOD GARMENTS OF WOOL AND OF TOW BEGAN TO BE WORN DYED WITH THE JUICE OF THE BUTTERNUT OR WHITE WALNUT AND THE HIDES OF NEAT-CATTLE BEGAN TO BE TANNED
WADDELL'S ANNALS OF AUGUSTA COUNTY SAYS HE MARRIED ELIZABETH WINTER A COUSIN OF DANIEL BOONE
MR HAY GIVES THIS ACCOUNT OF THE PRACTICE OF THE LAW IN THOSE DAYS
ORDERED THAT MICHAEL KILLION HUGH ARMSTRONG AND ABRAM LINCOLN BE APPOINTED TO VIEW SAID ROAD AND SAID LINCOLN TO ACT AS SURVEYOR
THE OLD FRENCH COLONIES AT NEW ORLEANS AND KASKASKIA WERE ALREADY STRONG OUTPOSTS OF CIVILIZATION AND THE NUCLEI OF SPREADING SETTLEMENTS
THIS OFTEN HAPPENED
DOUGLAS ADOPTS DIXON'S PROPOSITION
ON THE CONTRARY IF YOU WILL BUT FOLLOW MY ADVICE YOU WILL FIND IT WORTH MORE THAN EIGHTY TIMES EIGHTY DOLLARS TO YOU
INDICTMENTS WERE FOUND WRITS ISSUED AND THE PRINCIPAL FREE-STATE LEADERS ARRESTED OR FORCED TO FLEE FROM THE TERRITORY
THE TREASURY WAS EMPTY
IN 1774 BOONE WAS CALLED UPON BY THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA TO ESCORT A PARTY OF SURVEYORS THROUGH KENTUCKY AND ON HIS RETURN WAS GIVEN THE COMMAND OF THREE GARRISONS
STREET ROWDIES HAD BURNED HIM IN EFFIGY

LINCOLN WAS ALSO CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE WHICH WAS CHARGED WITH THE ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE AND A PARAGRAPH FROM THIS DOCUMENT IS WORTH QUOTING AS SHOWING THE USE WHICH HE MADE AT THAT EARLY DAY OF A PREGNANT TEXT WHICH WAS HEREAFTER TO FIGURE IN A FAR MORE MOMENTOUS CONNECTION AND EXERCISE A POWERFUL INFLUENCE UPON HIS CAREER
FOR THIS LATTER OFFICE THE INTERVENTION OF AN OFFICIAL SURVEYOR WAS NECESSARY AND THEREFORE MR CALHOUN HAD MORE BUSINESS THAN HE COULD ATTEND TO WITHOUT ASSISTANCE
BEFORE THE SESSION ENDED HE HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MOST OF THE MEMBERS AND HAD EVIDENTLY COME TO BE LOOKED UPON AS POSSESSING MORE THAN ORDINARY CAPACITY
HARDIN APOLOGIZED FOR THE DELAY IN SOME COMMITTEE BUSINESS ALLEGING MR LINCOLN'S INDISPOSITION AS AN EXCUSE
IN THE ACCOUNT OF ERRORS AND FOLLIES COMMITTED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO THE LASTING INJURY OF THE STATE HE IS ENTITLED TO NO PRAISE OR BLAME BEYOND THE REST
THEIR MANAGEMENT HAD BEEN EXCEEDINGLY MALADROIT AS A MORE MODEST CHAMPIONSHIP WOULD WITHOUT DOUBT HAVE SECURED HIM THE COVETED NOMINATION
LINCOLN VOTED AGAINST HIM AND THE ACT WAS MUCH ADMIRED BY THOSE WHO SAW IT
THERE IS NO NEWS HERE
15 1ST SESSION 33D CONGRESS WHEN CONGRESS MET AGAIN IN THE FOLLOWING DECEMBER 1853 THE ANNUAL MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT PIERCE WAS UPON THIS SUBJECT BUT AN ECHO OF HIS INAUGURAL AS HIS INAUGURAL HAD BEEN BUT AN ECHO OF THE TWO PARTY PLATFORMS OF 1852
LINCOLN'S CONVICTIONS WERE SO POSITIVE IN REGARD TO THE MATTER THAT ANY LAXITY OF OPINION AMONG HIS FRIENDS CAUSED HIM REAL SUFFERING
MORE THAN THIS
THE UTTER DEFEAT OF HIS NATION HAD GIVEN THE GUARANTEE OF A PERMANENT PEACE
BESIDES THE GENERAL OBJECTIONS WHICH THE ANTI-SLAVERY MEN OF THE NORTH HAD TO THE PROJECT ITSELF THERE WAS SOMETHING ESPECIALLY OFFENSIVE TO THEM IN THE PRETENSE OF FAIRNESS AND COMPROMISE HELD OUT BY THE RESOLUTIONS COMMITTING THE GOVERNMENT TO ANNEXATION
IT PURCHASED AND HELD ONLY THE LAND NECESSARY TO LOCATE THESE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES
LODGING FOR NIGHT 121/2
HOWARD OF TEXAS MADE THE MOST STRENUOUS OPPOSITION URGING THAT SINCE IT CONTAINED BUT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED SOULS ITS SOUTHERN BOUNDARY SHOULD BE FIXED AT 39 DEGREES 30 NOT TO TRENCH UPON THE INDIAN RESERVATIONS
OLDROTD SPRINGFIELD ILLINOIS THE SUPPOSITION WAS CERTAINLY WELL FOUNDED
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END LANE WENT EAST AND RECRUITED ADDITIONAL HELP FOR THE CONTEST
AN UNAUTHORIZED MOB INDUCED THE GOVERNOR WITH THAT PERSUASIVENESS IN WHICH THE BORDER RUFFIANS HAD BECOME ADEPTS TO LEAVE THE BOAT DETAINING HIM AT LEXINGTON ON THE ACCUSATION THAT HE WAS FLEEING FROM AN INDICTMENT
IF SHE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO RESPECTED HERSELF THE HOUSEHOLD GEAR SHE WOULD INSIST ON BRINGING WOULD ENTAIL AN ILIAD OF EMBARRASSMENTS
SEVEN SOUTHERN REPRESENTATIVES AND TWO SOUTHERN SENATORS HAD VOTED AGAINST THE NEBRASKA BILL AND MANY INDIVIDUAL VOTERS CONDEMNED IT AS AN ACT OF BAD FAITH--AS THE ABANDONMENT OF THE ACCEPTED FINALITY AND AS THE PROVOCATION OF A DANGEROUS ANTISLAVERY REACTION
HE GREW CONSTANTLY
THIS WAS GOOD WHIG DOCTRINE AT THAT TIME AND THE YOUNG POLITICIAN DID NOT FANCY HE COULD GO WRONG IN FOLLOWING IN SUCH A MATTER THE LEAD OF HIS IDOL HENRY CLAY
YOU HAVE HEARD THAT THE WHIGS AND LOCOS HAD A POLITICAL DISCUSSION SHORTLY AFTER THE MEETING OF THE LEGISLATURE
OLD SETTLERS SAY THAT THE SLOW COWARDLY BREED OF PRAIRIE WOLVES WHICH USED TO BE CAUGHT AND KILLED AS READILY AS SHEEP DISAPPEARED ABOUT THAT TIME AND NONE BUT THE FLEETER AND STRONGER SURVIVED
DECEMBER 28 1841 THE SESSION OF 1846-7 OPENED WITH THE SANGAMON DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS UNREPRESENTED IN CONGRESS
ENABLES THE ENEMIES OF FREE INSTITUTIONS WITH PLAUSIBILITY TO TAUNT US AS HYPOCRITES
ALTHOUGH IT WAS BUT A REPETITION IN GREAT PART OF THE TRIP YOUNG LINCOLN HAD MADE WITH GENTRY IT EVIDENTLY CREATED A FAR DEEPER IMPRESSION ON HIS MIND THAN THE FORMER ONE
THE COUNTRY WAS TO BE PEOPLED AND THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF PEOPLING IT BUT BY THE SACRIFICE OF MANY LIVES AND FORTUNES
PART AND PARCEL OF THE AFFAIR WAS THE PRETENSE THAT THIS EXPLOIT OF PRAIRIE BUCCANEERING HAD BEEN AUTHORIZED BY JUDGE LEEOMPTE'S COURT THE OFFICIALS CITING IN THEIR DEFENSE A PRESENTMENT OF HIS GRAND JURY DECLARING THE FREE-STATE NEWSPAPERS SEDITIOUS PUBLICATIONS AND THE FREE-STATE HOTEL A REBELLIOUS FORTIFICATION AND RECOMMENDING THEIR ABATEMENT AS NUISANCES
IN THEIR EAGERNESS TO PUSH HIS CLAIMS TO THE PRESIDENCY THE PARTISANS OF DOUGLAS COMMITTED A GREAT ERROR
34 WHEN THE 30TH OF MARCH ELECTION DAY FINALLY ARRIVED THE CONSPIRACY HAD ONCE MORE MUSTERED ITS ORGANIZED ARMY OF INVASION AND FIVE THOUSAND MISSOURI BORDER RUFFIANS IN DIFFERENT CAMPS BANDS AND SQUADS HELD PRACTICAL POSSESSION OF NEARLY EVERY ELECTION DISTRICT IN THE TERRITORY
IN THIS WAY IN THE LATE ELECTION THEY HAD SECURED THE SUCCESS OF GOVERNOR REYNOLDS--THE OLD RANGER--AGAINST GOVERNOR KINNEY WHO REPRESENTED THE VEHEMENT AND PROSCRIPTIVE SPIRIT WHICH JACKSON HAD JUST BREATHED INTO THE PARTY
THE WHIGS MUST SPEAK AND THEIR ONLY OPTION IS WHETHER THEY WILL WHEN THEY SPEAK TELL THE TRUTH OR TELL A FOUL AND VILLAINOUS FALSEHOOD SIDENOTE
THE WOODS SWARMED WITH GAME AND AFTER SWINE BEGAN TO BE RAISED THERE WAS THE BACON AND HOE-CAKE WHICH ANY SOUTH-WESTERN FARMER WILL SAY IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR A KING
TWO OR THREE WHIGS HAD THROWN AWAY THEIR VOTES ON THIS FIRST BALLOT AND THOUGH THEY NOW RETURNED AND ADHERED TO HIM THE DEMORALIZING EXAMPLE WAS IMITATED BY VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE COALITION
HE ASSUMED AT THE START A FRANK AND FRIENDLY RELATION WITH THE JURY WHICH WAS EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE
ONCE AFTER HE HAD SOLD A WOMAN A LITTLE BILL OF GOODS AND RECEIVED THE MONEY HE FOUND ON LOOKING OVER THE ACCOUNT AGAIN THAT SHE HAD GIVEN HIM SIX AND A QUARTER CENTS TOO MUCH
THE CLERGYMEN OF THE NORTHERN STATES NOT ONLY SPOKE AGAINST THE REPEAL FROM THEIR PULPITS BUT FORWARDED ENERGETIC PETITIONS AGAINST IT TO CONGRESS 3050 CLERGYMEN OF NEW ENGLAND OF DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS JOINING THEIR SIGNATURES IN ONE PROTEST
HE HAD THE SAME INDIVIDUALITY THAT HE KEPT THROUGH ALL HIS LIFE THERE WERE TWO OR THREE MEN AT THE MEETING WHOSE GOOD OPINION WAS WORTH MORE THAN ALL THE VOTES OF LICK CREEK TO ONE BEGINNING LIFE
MEN WERE RELUCTANT TO ABANDON THEIR OLD-TIME PRINCIPLES AND ASSOCIATIONS
THERE IS EVIDENT IN ALL THEIR UTTERANCES OF THE SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER OF 1844 AN ARDENT AND ALMOST FURIOUS CONVICTION NOT ONLY OF THE NECESSITY BUT THE CERTAINTY OF SUCCESS
IT IS NOT IN MY POWER TO DO SO
WELL DON'T GIVE IT UP LINCOLN REJOINED CHEERFULLY
ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS WAS HE ABSENT FROM HIS PLACE IN THE HOUSE
HERE WAS A GREAT EMPIRE OFFERING ITSELF TO US--A STATE WHICH HAD GAINED ITS INDEPENDENCE AND BUILT ITSELF INTO A CERTAIN MEASURE OF ORDER AND THRIFT THROUGH AMERICAN VALOR AND ENTERPRISE
THIS WAS OF COURSE THE ORIGINAL CONTROVERSY--SLAVERY BURNING TO ENFORCE HER USURPATION FREEDOM DETERMINED TO DEFEND HER BIRTHRIGHT
HE HAD VAST CONCERNS INTRUSTED TO HIM IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE AND DISPOSED OF THEM ONE AT A TIME AS THEY WERE PRESENTED
IT WAS TOO SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD EVEN IF IT HAD ANY OTHER MERITS TO MEET THE APPROVAL OF AN ASSEMBLY INTENT ONLY UPON GETTING OUT OF IMMEDIATE EMBARRASSMENT BY MEANS WHICH MIGHT SAVE THEM FUTURE TROUBLE ON THE STUMP
BY THIS IF YOU HIRE YOURSELF AT TEN DOLLARS A MONTH FROM ME YOU WILL GET TEN MORE MAKING TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH FOR YOUR WORK
NEVERTHELESS HE WENT TO WORK WITH SUCH EARNESTNESS AND SUCCESS THAT IN A FEW MONTHS MRS GREENE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF BEING ABLE TO INVITE A GATHERING OF GENTLEMEN FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE TO BEHOLD WITH THEIR OWN EYES THE WORKING OF THE NEWLY INVENTED COTTON-GIN WITH WHICH A NEGRO MAN TURNING A CRANK COULD CLEAN FIFTY POUNDS OF COTTON PER DAY
HE KEPT HIS FRIENDS AWARE OF HIS WISHES AS TO CONVENTIONS AND DELEGATES
DUBOIS THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE SANGAMON COUNTY DELEGATION IN OBTAINING THE CAPITAL WAS DUE TO THE ADROIT MANAGEMENT OF MR LINCOLN--FIRST IN INDUCING ALL THE RIVAL CLAIMANTS TO UNITE IN A VOTE TO MOVE THE CAPITAL FROM VANDALIA AND THEN IN CARRYING A DIRECT VOTE FOR SPRINGFIELD THROUGH THE JOINT CONVENTION BY THE ASSISTANCE OF THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES
HE HAD SETTLED IN JEFFERSON COUNTY ON THE LAND HE HAD BOUGHT FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND CLEARED A SMALL FARM IN THE FOREST
THEIR FOOD CONSISTED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY OF GAME FISH AND ROUGHLY GROUND CORN MEAL
WHITE OF TENNESSEE
WE PROTEST AGAINST IT THEY SAID AS A GREAT MORAL WRONG AS A BREACH OF FAITH EMINENTLY UNJUST TO THE MORAL PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMUNITY AND SUBVERSIVE OF ALL CONFIDENCE IN NATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS

THE GENEROUS MEN OF OUR COMPANY WALKED AND RODE BY TURNS WITH US AND WE FARED ABOUT EQUAL WITH THE REST
ON THE OTHER HAND THE WHIGS IN A BODY DECLARED AGAINST HIM BUT WERE WEAKENED BY A SCATTERING DESERTION IN THE CENTER AND SOUTH
THE GEORGIA LEGISLATURE OFFERED A REWARD OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ANY ONE WHO SHOULD KIDNAP GARRISON OR WHO SHOULD BRING TO CONVICTION ANY ONE CIRCULATING THE LIBERATOR IN THE STATE
AFTER HE HAD SERVED ONE TERM IN THE SENATE HE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS AND WAS SOON SENT BACK TO THE SAME BODY FROM MINNESOTA
THE COMPANY OF THE FOURTH REGIMENT ILLINOIS MOUNTED VOLUNTEERS COMMANDED BY MR LINCOLN WAS WITH OTHERS CALLED OUT BY GOVERNOR REYNOLDS AND WAS ORGANIZED AT RICHLAND SANGAMON COUNTY ILLINOIS APRIL 21 1832
THEY HAD VOTED FOR PIERCE SHOUTED FOR THE PLATFORM OF 52 APPLAUDED THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA ACT AND EMIGRATED TO THE TERRITORY TO ENJOY THE NEW POLITICAL GOSPEL OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY
AND FINALLY ON THE 49TH BALLOT OCCURRED THE MEMORABLE NEARLY UNANIMOUS SELECTION OF FRANKLIN PIERCE NOT BECAUSE OF ANY MERIT OF HIS OWN BUT TO BREAK THE INSURMOUNTABLE DEAD-LOCK OF FACTIONAL HATRED
HE WAS HIRED BY MR GENTRY THE PROPRIETOR OF THE NEIGHBORING VILLAGE OF GENTRYVILLE TO ACCOMPANY HIS SON WITH A FLAT-BOAT OF PRODUCE TO NEW ORLEANS AND INTERMEDIATE LANDINGS
YOUR SHORT BUT ABLE AND PATRIOTIC SPEECH ON THAT OCCASION HAS NOT BEEN IMPROVED UPON SINCE BY THOSE HOLDING THE SAME VIEWS
18 SIDENOTE
WHILE I HAVE PEN IN HAND ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT I HAVE BEEN PERPLEXED TO UNDERSTAND WHY MY NAME WAS PLACED ON THAT COMMITTEE
THE READER HAS DOUBTLESS ALREADY NOTED IN HIS MIND THE CURIOUS HISTORICAL COINCIDENCE WHICH SO SOON FOLLOWED THE FOREGOING SPECULATIVE AFFIRMATION
A BEDSTEAD MADE OF POLES STUCK BETWEEN THE LOGS IN THE ANGLE OF THE CABIN THE OUTSIDE CORNER SUPPORTED BY A CROTCHED STICK DRIVEN INTO THE GROUND
HE SAID THEY WERE ALTOGETHER PEACEFUL AND LEGAL
THE DEMOCRATS HAD REJECTED THE RESOLUTION OFFERED BY YANCEY COMMITTING THEM TO THE DOCTRINE OF NON-INTERFERENCE WITH THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY IN THE TERRITORIES AND THE WHIGS HAD NEVER ALLOWED THE WILMOT PROVISO TO BE VOTED UPON
HE NEVER TOOK HIS CAMPAIGNING SERIOUSLY
THIS INCIDENT TRIVIAL AND VULGAR AS IT MAY SEEM WAS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN LINCOLN'S LIFE
THEY WERE MEN OF GREAT PHYSICAL AND MORAL ENDURANCE ABSOLUTELY DEVOTED TO THEIR WORK WHICH THEY PURSUED IN THE FACE OF EVERY HARDSHIP AND DISCOURAGEMENT
BUT HE ADDED WITH A SIGNIFICANT OATH BOYS WE WILL FIGHT SOME TIME THIRTEEN OF THE CAPTAINS IN THE WAKARUSA CAMP WERE CALLED TOGETHER AND THE SITUATION WAS DULY EXPLAINED
THEY FINALLY MADE ROADS BY WALLOWING THROUGH THE SNOW AS AN ILLINOIS HISTORIAN EXPRESSES IT AND GOING PATIENTLY OVER THE SAME TRACK UNTIL THE SNOW WAS TRAMPLED HARD AND ROUNDED LIKE A TURNPIKE

THEY HAD BEEN GLORIFYING THEIR WORK TOO ENERGETICALLY TO DESTROY IT IN ITS INFANCY
WHETHER HE SHALL BE I SUBMIT TO THE DEPARTMENT

LINCOLN MADE HIS VISIT TO KENTUCKY WITH SPEED AND RETURNED TO FIND HIMSELF GENERALLY TALKED OF FOR GOVERNOR OF THE STATE
MR LINCOLN OF ILLINOIS NEXT CAME FORWARD AND WAS RECEIVED WITH GREAT APPLAUSE
IN OFFICE HE HAD DEVOTED HIMSELF SPECIALLY TO THE ECONOMICAL AND MATERIAL QUESTIONS AFFECTING ILLINOIS AND IN THIS ROLE HAD A WIDE POPULARITY WITH ALL CLASSES AND PARTIES
HIS MIND WAS LOGICAL AND DIRECT AND HE DID NOT INDULGE IN EXTRANEOUS DISCUSSION
AS HAS BEEN STATED IN THE OPPOSITION TO DOUGLAS'S REPEAL THE FEW AVOWED ABOLITIONISTS AND THE MANY PRONOUNCED FREE-SOILERS DISPLAYING UNWONTED ACTIVITY CAME SUDDENLY INTO THE FOREGROUND TO ROUSE AND ORGANIZE PUBLIC OPINION MAKING IT SEEM FOR THE MOMENT THAT THEY HAD REALLY ASSUMED LEADERSHIP AND CONTROL IN POLITICS
UNTIL THE FIRST LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE DULY CONSTITUTED HE HAD AUTHORITY TO FIX ELECTION DAYS DEFINE ELECTION DISTRICTS DIRECT THE MODE OF RETURNS TAKE A CENSUS LOCATE THE TEMPORARY SEAT OF GOVERNMENT DECLARE VACANCIES ORDER NEW ELECTIONS TO FILL THEM BESIDES THE USUAL AND PERMANENT POWERS OF AN EXECUTIVE

HE READ LAW-BOOKS BUT LITTLE EXCEPT WHEN THE CAUSE IN HAND MADE IT NECESSARY
LINCOLN WAS LYING ON THE BED APPARENTLY PAYING NO ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING ON
PUBLISHED IN THE CLEVELAND POST MARCH 31 1878 HE PROCEEDED CAREFULLY AND CAUTIOUSLY ABOUT IT AFTER HIS HABIT

IT MAY BE SAID WITH TRUTH THAT THE YEAR 1854 FORMED ONE CONTINUOUS AND SOLID POLITICAL CAMPAIGN FROM JANUARY TO NOVEMBER RISING IN INTEREST AND EARNESTNESS FROM FIRST TO LAST AND ENGAGING IN THE DISCUSSION MORE FULLY THAN HAD EVER OCCURRED IN PREVIOUS AMERICAN HISTORY ALL THE CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF OUR POPULATION
THE CLAY PARTY WERE OF COURSE FREE FROM ANY COMPLICITY WITH THESE OUTRAGES BUT THE FOREIGNERS IN THEIR ALARM HUDDLED TOGETHER ALMOST AS ONE MAN ON THE SIDE WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THEM ALWAYS VOTED AND THIS OCCASIONED A HEAVY LOSS TO THE WHIGS IN SEVERAL STATES
ONLY IN HIS THIRTY-NINTH YEAR HE HAD SERVED AS MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE AS STATE'S ATTORNEY AS SECRETARY OF STATE AND AS JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT IN ILLINOIS AND HAD SINCE BEEN THREE TIMES ELECTED TO CONGRESS AND ONCE TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
I CAN POSSIBLY GET CASS BUT I DO NOT THINK I WILL

IT WAS IN THESE STREET TALKS THAT THE RISING AND ASPIRING YOUNG LAWYER FOUND HIS DAILY AND HOURLY FORUM
80 OTHERWISE HIS LIFE AT THIS TIME DIFFERED LITTLE FROM THAT OF ORDINARY FARM-HANDS
HE HAD BEEN AS MANY THOUGHT UNJUSTLY PASSED OVER IN 1840 AND GENERAL HARRISON A MAN OF GREATLY INFERIOR CAPACITY HAD BEEN PREFERRED TO HIM ON THE GROUNDS OF PRUDENCE AND EXPEDIENCY AFTER THREE DAYS OF BALLOTING HAD SHOWN THAT THE ELOQUENT KENTUCKIAN HAD MORE FRIENDS AND MORE ENEMIES THAN ANY OTHER MAN IN THE REPUBLIC

MR LINCOLN BEGAN HIS CANVASS WITH THE FOLLOWING CIRCULAR
THIS CLASS OF MEN HAD LONG BEEN HELD UP TO PUBLIC ODIUM
BAKER TOO WHO IS NOW HERE SAYS THE TRUTH IS UNDOUBTEDLY THAT WAY
LINCOLN SANGAMON COUNTY APPEARS AS A PRIVATE FROM MAY 27 1832 TO JUNE 16 1832 WHEN THE COMPANY WAS MUSTERED OUT OF SERVICE BY LIEUTENANT ROBERT ANDERSON THIRD UNITED STATES ARTILLERY AND COLONEL ASSISTANT INSPECTOR-GENERAL ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS
YOU SAY YOU WOULD ALMOST GIVE YOUR PLACE IN HEAVEN FOR SEVENTY OR EIGHTY DOLLARS
WHITE FOR PRESIDENT
EVERY VESSEL COMING WEST WAS LOADED WITH THEM THEIR MONEY AND MEANS BOUND FOR CHICAGO THE GREAT FAIRY-LAND OF FORTUNES
HE HAD FEW OR NO SPECIAL INTIMATES AND THERE WAS A LINE BEYOND WHICH NO ONE EVER THOUGHT OF PASSING
THE BOONE AND LINCOLN FAMILIES WERE LARGE AND THERE WERE FREQUENT INTERMARRIAGES AMONG THEM AND THE PATRIARCHAL NAME OF ABRAHAM WAS A FAVORITE ONE

IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS MERELY DEFENSIVE ENERGY WOULD HAVE BEEN OVERCOME AND DISSIPATED HAD IT NOT AT THIS JUNCTURE BEEN INSPIRITED AND LED BY THE FACTION KNOWN AS THE FREE-SOIL PARTY OF THE COUNTRY COMPOSED MAINLY OF MEN OF INDEPENDENT ANTI-SLAVERY VIEWS WHO HAD DURING FOUR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS BEEN ORGANIZED AS A DISTINCT POLITICAL BODY WITH NO NEAR HOPE OF SUCCESS BUT ANIMATED MAINLY BY THE DESIRE TO GIVE EXPRESSION TO THEIR DEEP PERSONAL CONVICTIONS
IT HAD EXTENDED NORTHWARD ALONG THE LINES OF THE WOODED VALLEYS OF CREEKS AND RIVERS IN THE CENTER TO PEORIA

THEIR CIRCUITS WERE FREQUENTLY SO GREAT IN EXTENT THAT THEY WERE FORCED TO BE CONSTANTLY ON THE ROUTE
THE RURAL INHABITANTS WERE MARKED BY THE STRONG CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FRONTIER,--FONDNESS OF ADVENTURE RECKLESSNESS OF EXPOSURE OR DANGER TO LIFE A BOASTFUL ASSERTION OF PERSONAL RIGHT PRIVILEGE OR PROWESS A DAILY AND HOURLY FAMILIARITY WITH THE USE OF FIRE-ARMS
BUT HIS HIGHEST RANGE OF VOTES WAS ABOUT 74 TO 76
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS CONVULSED IN DISCUSSION
HE WENT THERE TO ENDEAVOR TO HAVE THE CAPITAL MOVED TO JACKSONVILLE WHERE HE LIVED BUT HE GAVE UP THE FIGHT FOR THE PURPOSE OF HAVING HIMSELF APPOINTED REGISTER OF THE LAND OFFICE AT SPRINGFIELD
THENCE HE JOURNEYED ACROSS A TRACKLESS PRAIRIE SIXTY MILES AND AT QUINCY HAD ONE CASE AND GAINED FIVE DOLLARS
THE OPPOSING CANDIDATE WAS JAMES A
BAKER AND HIS WIFE BELONGED TO THAT NUMEROUS AND POWERFUL SECT WHICH HAS SEVERAL TIMES PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN WESTERN POLITICS--THE DISCIPLES
THIS PURPOSE WAS AVOWED BY JOHN C
HE WROTE FOR HIS OWN AMUSEMENT AND EDIFICATION ESSAYS ON POLITICS OF WHICH GENTLEMEN OF STANDING WHO HAD BEEN FAVORED WITH A PERUSAL SAID WITH AUTHORITY AT THE CROSS-ROADS GROCERY THE WORLD CAN'T BEAT IT ONE OR TWO OF THESE COMPOSITIONS GOT INTO PRINT AND VASTLY INCREASED THE AUTHOR'S LOCAL FAME
83 THEY MADE A QUICK TRIP DOWN THE SANGAMON THE ILLINOIS AND THE MISSISSIPPI RIVERS
BUT THE PRINCIPLE OF CHAMPIONSHIP WHILE IT YIELDED HIGH HONOR AND CONSIDERATION TO THE VICTOR IMPOSED UPON HIM THE CORRESPONDING OBLIGATION TO RECOGNIZE EVERY OPPONENT AND ACCEPT EVERY CHALLENGE
A VAGUE AND IGNORANT ASTRONOMY GOVERNED THEIR PLANTINGS AND SOWINGS THE BREEDING OF THEIR CATTLE AND ALL FARM-WORK
THIS NOMINATION WAS OF COURSE ANTICIPATED THERE BEING NO OTHER CANDIDATE IN THE FIELD

A MAN IN MACOUPIN COUNTY LEFT HIS WAGON LOADED WITH CORN STUCK IN THE PRAIRIE MUD FOR TWO WEEKS NEAR A FREQUENTED ROAD
ABOVE ALL IT IS PERVADED BY AN ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND AIM THAT LIFTS IT OUT OF THE COMMONPLACE OF MERE PARTY CONTROVERSY
OUR IRISH BLACKSMITH GREGORY IS FOR HARRISON
THE MAGICAL POWER OF THE MOON WAS WIDE IN ITS INFLUENCE
IN FACT HE MAKES NO PERSONAL CLAIM WHATEVER
FALL OF THE BANKS
THE DEMOCRATS AVOIDED THE ISSUE
HE WAS THINKING SOLELY OF THE PUBLIC GOOD SAYING I HAVE ENCOURAGED THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ALL THAT I COULD BUT I CAN NO LONGER JUSTIFY THEM OR MYSELF TO RISK OUR LIVES HERE UNDER SUCH EXTRAORDINARY HAZARDS HE THEREFORE BEGGED HIS EXCELLENCY TO TAKE IMMEDIATE MEASURES FOR RELIEF
AND FINALLY HE TELLS STUART THAT JOE SMITH IS AN ADMIRER OF HIS AND THAT A FEW DOCUMENTS HAD BETTER BE MAILED TO THE MORMONS
HE COULD NOT SHAKE OFF HIS PAIN LIKE MEN OF COOLER HEADS AND SHALLOWER HEARTS
THE ONLY IMPORTANT INCIDENT OF THE TRIP OCCURRED AT THE PLANTATION OF MADAME DUCHESNE A FEW MILES BELOW BATON ROUGE
NOW COMBINING WISDOM WITH OPPORTUNITY IT BECAME CONCILIATORY AND ABATING SOMETHING OF ITS ABSTRACTIONS MADE ITSELF THE EXPONENT OF A DEMAND FOR A PRESENT AND PRACTICAL REFORM--A SIMPLE RETURN TO THE ANCIENT FAITH AND LANDMARKS
HIS STRAIGHTFORWARD DEVOTION TO HIS PROFESSION
FOR INSTANCE ABRAHAM LINCOLN OF CHESTER COUNTY SON OF ONE MORDECAI AND BROTHER OF ANOTHER THE PRESIDENT'S ANCESTORS LEFT A FAIR ESTATE BY WILL TO HIS CHILDREN WHOSE NAMES WERE JOHN ABRAHAM ISAAC JACOB MORDECAI REBECCA AND SARAH--PRECISELY THE SAME NAMES WE FIND IN THREE COLLATERAL FAMILIES.]--REMOVED TO MONMOUTH NEW JERSEY AND THENCE TO AMITY TOWNSHIP NOW A PART OF NOW A PART OF BERKS COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA WHERE HE DIED IN 1735 FIFTY YEARS OLD

THE PLAN OF THE BATTLE OF CERRO GORDO WAS SO FULLY CARRIED OUT IN ACTION THAT THE OFFICIAL REPORT IS HARDLY MORE THAN THE GENERAL ORDERS TRANSLATED FROM THE FUTURE TENSE TO THE PAST
ITS LEGISLATION WAS ALMOST WHOLLY UNWISE AND HURTFUL
HE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO TEST THE QUESTION WHETHER IT WERE POSSIBLE TO REMOVE FROM THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT THIS STAIN AND OFFENSE
ITS STUPENDOUS PHYSICAL FEATURES WERE AS LITTLE APPRECIATED AS THE VAST MORAL AND POLITICAL RESULTS WHICH WERE TO FLOW FROM ITS ABSORPTION INTO OUR COMMONWEALTH

THAT I WAS WELL SATISFIED THAT THE MISSOURI RESTRICTION IF NOT EXPRESSLY REPEALED WOULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THE TERRITORY TO WHICH IT HAD BEEN APPLIED THUS NEGATIVING THE GREAT AND SALUTARY PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERVENTION WHICH CONSTITUTED THE MOST PROMINENT AND ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF THE PLAN OF SETTLEMENT OF 1850
THE FEUDS AND BATTLES OF A QUARTER OF A CENTURY WERE NOT EASILY FORGOTTEN OR BURIED
BUT HIS SUCCESS TWO YEARS BEFORE IN THE FACE OF A VINDICTIVE OPPOSITION LED BY THE STRONGEST JACKSON MEN IN THE DISTRICT HAD MADE HIM SOMEWHAT CONFIDENT AND HE PERHAPS THOUGHT HE WAS RISKING LITTLE BY GIVING A HELPING HAND TO HIS COMRADE IN THE SPY BATTALION
THE SENATE CHAMBER PRESENTED A DISCOURAGING ARRAY OF EMPTY BENCHES
THE FINANCES OF THE STATE WERE IN A DEPLORABLE CONDITION
MAP SHOWING VARIOUS LOCALITIES CONNECTED WITH EARLY EVENTS IN THE LINCOLN FAMILY THE LIFE OF THE PIONEER ABRAHAM LINCOLN SOON CAME TO A DISASTROUS CLOSE
THIS IDEA DID NOT COMMEND ITSELF TO THE JUDGMENT OF HIMSELF OR HIS FRIENDS AND ACCORDINGLY WE FIND IN THE SANGAMO JOURNAL ONE OF THOSE SEMI OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS SO MUCH IN VOGUE IN EARLY WESTERN POLITICS WHICH WHILE DISCLAIMING ANY DIRECT INSPIRATION FROM MR LINCOLN EXPRESSED THE GRATITUDE OF HIS FRIENDS FOR THE MOVEMENT IN HIS FAVOR BUT DECLINED THE NOMINATION
THEY HAD ELABORATELY BUILT UP THEIR LEGAL DESPOTISM COMMISSIONED TRUSTY ADHERENTS TO ADMINISTER IT AND PROVIDED THEIR PRINCIPAL AND UNDOUBTED PARTISANS WITH MILITARY AUTHORITY TO SEE THAT IT WAS DULY EXECUTED
MORGAN AND SCOTT ARE BEYOND MY REACH MENARD IS SAFE TO ME
THE PERIOD FOLLOWING HAD FOR HIM BEEN YEARS OF WORK STUDY AND REFLECTION
IT WILL GIVE OUR COURTS A POLITICAL AND PARTISAN CHARACTER THEREBY IMPAIRING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THEIR DECISIONS
THE WHIGS WERE KEENLY ALIVE TO THIS CHANCE AND ITS INFLUENCE UPON THEIR POSSIBLE ASCENDENCY IN THE STATE
THERE WAS TO BE A RAIL-ROAD FROM GALENA TO THE MOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER
THE SAME THING IS DAILY SAID OF THOUSANDS OF BOYS WHO WILL NEVER BE CONSTABLES
DOUGLAS OCCUPIED A SEAT JUST IN FRONT OF HIM AND IN HIS REJOINDER HE EXPLAINED THAT MY FRIEND MR LINCOLN EXPRESSLY INVITED ME TO STAY AND HEAR HIM SPEAK TO DAY AS HE HEARD ME YESTERDAY AND TO ANSWER AND DEFEND MYSELF AS BEST I COULD
BROWNING THE LEGISLATURE ADJOURNED ON THE 18TH OF JANUARY HAVING MADE A BEGINNING IT IS TRUE IN THE WORK OF IMPROVING THE STATE BY STATUTE THOUGH ITS MODEST WORK INCORPORATING CANAL AND BRIDGE COMPANIES AND PROVIDING FOR PUBLIC ROADS BORE NO RELATION TO THE AMBITIOUS ESSAYS OF ITS SUCCESSOR

THE FASCINATION OF WASHINGTON CHAPTER XVII
IT VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLES OF FREE GOVERNMENT BY SUBJECTING THE JUDICIARY TO THE LEGISLATURE
UPON THE VITAL POINT THE INVESTIGATION WAS DEEMED CONCLUSIVE
PROPERTY BEING SO HARD TO GET WAS JEALOUSLY GUARDED AS WE HAVE ALREADY NOTICED IN SPEAKING OF THE SETTLEMENT OF KENTUCKY
IN THE MEANTIME OUR FRIENDS WITH A VIEW OF DETAINING OUR EXPECTED BOLTERS HAD BEEN TURNING FROM ME TO TRUMBULL TILL HE HAD RISEN TO 35 AND I HAD BEEN REDUCED TO 15

HIS FREEDOM WHEN HE HAS GAINED IT YIELDS HIM NOTHING BUT AN AGONY OF REMORSE AND HUMILIATION
HE MIGHT GET NEW YORK AND THAT WOULD HAVE ELECTED IN 1844 BUT IT WILL NOT NOW BECAUSE HE MUST NOW AT THE LEAST LOSE TENNESSEE WHICH HE HAD THEN AND IN ADDITION THE FIFTEEN NEW VOTES OF FLORIDA TEXAS IOWA AND WISCONSIN LATER HE WROTE TO THE SAME FRIEND THAT THE NOMINATION TOOK THE DEMOCRATS ON THE BLIND SIDE
OF OLD THEY KNEW HIS PECULIAR HOLD AND INFLUENCE UPON THE PEOPLE AND HIS PARTY
I HAVE NO WEALTHY OR POWERFUL RELATIONS OR FRIENDS TO RECOMMEND ME
THE SUIT WOULD LEAD TO A FREE FIGHT AND SOMETIMES FURNISH THE BLOODY INCIDENTS FOR A MURDER TRIAL
THERE WAS SCARCELY A DAY OR HOUR WHEN A KNOT OF MEN MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SEEN NEAR THE DOOR OF SOME PROMINENT STORE OR ABOUT THE STEPS OF THE COURT-HOUSE EAGERLY DISCUSSING A CURRENT POLITICAL TOPIC--NOT AS A QUESTION OF NEWS FOR NEWS WAS NOT THEN RECEIVED QUICKLY OR FREQUENTLY AS IT IS NOW BUT RATHER FOR THE SAKE OF DEBATE
LITTLE IS KNOWN OF THIS PIONEER LINCOLN OR OF HIS FATHER
ATCHISON BUT ONCE LANDED AT INDEPENDENCE OR LEAVENWORTH THEY WERE OF THE FRONTIER OF THE WILDERNESS OF THE DESERT
THIS LIFE HAS BEEN VAUNTED BY POETS AND ROMANCERS AS A HAPPY AND HEALTHFUL ONE
AN EXTRACT FROM THE ONE SENT BY THE CLAY CLUBS OF NEW YORK WILL SHOW THE EARNEST ATTACHMENT AND PRIDE WITH WHICH THE YOUNG MEN OF THAT DAY STILL DECLARED THEIR LOYALTY TO THEIR BELOVED LEADER EVEN IN THE MIDST OF IRREPARABLE DISASTER
HE COMPOSED DIFFERENCES AMONG FRIENDS AND EQUALS WITH GOOD-NATURED RAILLERY BUT HE WAS AS ROUGH AS NEED BE WHEN HIS WRATH WAS ROUSED BY MEANNESS AND CRUELTY
THE NEW QUESTION STRUCK THROUGH PARTY LINES IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO CONFUSE AND PERPLEX THE MASSES
GENERAL ATKINSON FURTHER REPORTS THAT THESE COMPANIES AND SOME THREE HUNDRED REGULAR TROOPS REMAINING IN POSITION AT ROCK RIVER WERE ALL THE FORCE LEFT HIM TO KEEP THE ENEMY IN CHECK UNTIL THE ASSEMBLAGE OF THE THREE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL ILLINOIS MILITIA CALLED OUT BY THE GOVERNOR UPON HIS GENERAL A.'S REQUISITION TO RENDEZVOUS AT OTTAWA JUNE 12-15 1832 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT CAPTAIN ILES'S COMPANY MENTIONED ABOVE WAS ONE OF THE SIX WHICH SERVED UNTIL JUNE 16 1832 WHILE THE FACT IS FULLY ESTABLISHED THAT THE COMPANY OF WHICH MR LINCOLN WAS A MEMBER WAS MUSTERED OUT BY LIEUTENANT ROBERT ANDERSON WHO IN APRIL 1861 WAS IN COMMAND OF FORT SUMTER

HE OFTEN VISITED THE CITIES OF THE ATLANTIC COAST BUT SAW LITTLE IN THEM TO ADMIRE
FOR FIFTY CENTS A DAY AND A CONTINGENT DIVIDEND OF TWENTY DOLLARS APIECE SEEMED LIKE A PROMISE OF IMMEDIATE OPULENCE TO THE BOYS
ENCOURAGED BY THIS SUCCESSFUL DOMINATION OVER REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS DOUGLAS PREPARED TO FORCE ITS ACCEPTANCE BY THE PEOPLE
THE COUNTY CONTAINED NEARLY 18,000 SOULS OF WHOM 78 WERE FREE NEGROES 20 REGISTERED INDENTURED SERVANTS AND SIX SLAVES
UNDER THE IMPULSE OF THAT OCCASION NEARLY HALF THE STATES ADOPTED SYSTEMS OF EMANCIPATION AT ONCE
HE HAD NOT BEEN IN FAVOR OF THE MARCH TO THE RIO GRANDE AND HAD RESISTED EVERY SUGGESTION TO THAT EFFECT UNTIL HIS PEREMPTORY ORDERS CAME
IN THAT SPEECH YOU SPOKE OF THE PEACEFUL EXTINCTION OF SLAVERY AND USED OTHER EXPRESSIONS INDICATING YOUR BELIEF THAT THE THING WAS AT SOME TIME TO HAVE AN END
AND FINALLY WITH A FEW REGIMENTS OF RAW LEVIES POSTED AMONG THE ROCKY SPURS AND GORGES ABOUT THE FARM OF BUENA VISTA MET AND DEFEATED THE BEST-LED AND THE BEST-FOUGHT ARMY THE MEXICANS EVER BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD OUTNUMBERING HIM MORE THAN FOUR TO ONE
HE MADE A FEW SPEECHES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF NEW SALEM AND AT LEAST ONE IN SPRINGFIELD
FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE RAIDS OF THE OLD SAC CHIEFTAIN UPON THAT PORTION OF HIS PATRIMONY WHICH HE HAD CEDED TO THE UNITED STATES HAD KEPT THE SETTLERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROCK ISLAND IN TERROR AND MENACED THE PEACE OF THE FRONTIER
THE CALIFORNIA GOLD DISCOVERY
A COMMITTEE APPOINTED ITSELF TO WAIT UPON HIM
IN THE SPRING OF 1831 HE CAME OVER TO THE EAST SIDE OF THE RIVER WITH A CONSIDERABLE BAND OF WARRIORS HAVING BEEN ENCOURAGED BY SECRET PROMISES OF COOPERATION FROM SEVERAL OTHER TRIBES
AND THE MOTTO NO EXTENSION OF SLAVERY WAS POSTPONED FORTY YEARS TO THE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN OF 1860
THE REAL AND EFFECTIVE GAIN THEREFORE WAS THE MORE OR LESS THOROUGH ALLIANCE OF THE WHIG PARTY AND THE FREE-SOIL PARTY OF THE NORTHERN STATES
AND KNOWING THIS I CANNOT DENY THAT ALL MAY BE SWEPT AWAY
BUT IF THE GOOD PEOPLE IN THEIR WISDOM SHALL SEE FIT TO KEEP ME IN THE BACKGROUND I HAVE BEEN TOO FAMILIAR WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS TO BE VERY MUCH CHAGRINED THIS IS ALMOST PRECISELY THE STYLE OF HIS LATER YEARS
IN THE LATTER PART OF THE LAST CENTURY AND THE FIRST HALF OF THIS MEN WERE CALLED OLD WHOM WE SHOULD REGARD AS IN THE PRIME OF LIFE

EDWARDS AT SPRINGFIELD
THE WHIGS IN THIS ELECTION EFFECTED A REVOLUTION IN THE POLITICS OF THE COUNTY
THIS SUPREME MOMENT IN LINCOLN'S CAREER THIS FATEFUL TURNING OF THE POLITICAL TIDE FOUND HIM FULLY PREPARED FOR THE NEW BATTLE EQUIPPED BY REFLECTION AND RESEARCH TO PERMIT HIMSELF TO BE PITTED AGAINST THE CHAMPION OF DEMOCRACY--AGAINST THE VERY AUTHOR OF THE RAGING STORM OF PARTIES
BUT PERHAPS AFTER ALL THE THING WHICH GAINED AND FIXED HIS MASTERY OVER HIS FELLOWS WAS TO A GREAT DEGREE HIS GIGANTIC STATURE AND STRENGTH
MEANWHILE THE CHIEFS SAT ON THEIR HORSES AND VIEWED THE WORK OF DESTRUCTION
THE INFLUENCE OF THIS RESULT UPON PARTIES OLD AND NEW IS PERHAPS BEST ILLUSTRATED IN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE THIRTY-FOURTH CONGRESS CHOSEN AT THESE ELECTIONS DURING THE YEAR 1854 WHICH WITNESSED THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE
BUT MR LOVEJOY WAS A PREDESTINED MARTYR
YOU'LL SPOIL AND BLOW IF YOU LIVE MUCH LONGER RADFORD'S PRUDENCE PREVENTED AN ACTUAL COLLISION WHICH IT MUST BE CONFESSED LINCOLN REGRETTED
CALIFORNIA ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH HER ACQUISITION WAS PEOPLED IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MONTHS BY THE WORLD-RENOWNED GOLD DISCOVERIES
A YOUTH NAMED MILTON HAY WHO AFTERWARDS BECAME ONE OF THE FOREMOST LAWYERS OF THE STATE HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF LINCOLN AT THE COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE AND PROPOSED TO STUDY LAW WITH HIM
THE MANEUVER WAS NOT UNEXPECTED FOR THOUGH THE GOVERNOR AND THE PARTY NEWSPAPERS HAD HITHERTO VEHEMENTLY ASSERTED HE WAS NOT A CANDIDATE THE POLITICAL SIGNS PLAINLY CONTRADICTED SUCH STATEMENT
IF HE SAW ANY LIVE FIGHTING INDIANS IT WAS MORE THAN I DID BUT I HAD A GOOD MANY BLOODY STRUGGLES WITH THE MOSQUITOES
THEY CONSIDERED THEIR SUCCESS ALREADY ASSURED
ORDERING AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT THE JUDGES SHOULD BE SWORN THAT CONSTABLES SHOULD ATTEND AND PRESERVE ORDER AND THAT VOTERS MUST BE ACTUAL RESIDENTS TO THE EXCLUSION OF ANY OTHER HOME
ALAS THAT HEARTS SO FIERY THEN SHOULD SOON BE COLD AND LOW CHAPTER XV THE THIRTIETH CONGRESS THE THIRTIETH CONGRESS ORGANIZED ON THE 6TH OF DECEMBER 1847
IN THIS RACE THE FREE STATES BY REASON OF THEIR GREATER POPULATION WEALTH AND COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE WOULD HAVE OUTSTRIPPED THE SOUTH BUT FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW AND POWERFUL INFLUENCE WHICH OPERATED EXCLUSIVELY IN FAVOR OF THE LATTER
HE BUILT A RUDE RAFT LOADED IT WITH HIS KIT OF TOOLS AND FOUR HUNDRED GALLONS OF WHISKY AND TRUSTED HIS FORTUNES TO THE WINDING WATER-COURSES
LYMAN TRUMBULL ONE ADDITIONAL CIRCUMSTANCE HAD ITS EFFECT ON PUBLIC OPINION
THE RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY THE PRINCIPAL BODY OF DELEGATES WHO CAME TOGETHER IN DECEMBER DIRECTED THE LEGISLATURE TO VOTE A SYSTEM OF INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS COMMENSURATE WITH THE WANTS OF THE PEOPLE A PHRASE WHICH IS NEVER LACKING IN THE MOUTH OF THE CHARLATAN OR THE DEMAGOGUE
HE WAS MERELY A GOOD BOY WITH SUFFICIENT WICKEDNESS TO PROVE HIS HUMANITY
THESE TOPICS WHILE THEY FURNISHED THEMES FOR CAMPAIGN SPEECHES FOR THE PRESENT LED TO NO PRACTICAL LEGISLATION
HE DESIRED--SO THE NEWSPAPERS AVERRED--THAT THE CARIBBEAN SEA SHOULD BE DECLARED AN AMERICAN LAKE AND NOTHING SO DELIGHTED HIM AS TO PULL THE BEARD OF THE BRITISH LION
ILLINOIS IN 1818 FREE
THE SPIRIT OF INTOLERANCE WHICH ONCE PERVADED ALL SLAVEHOLDING COMMUNITIES IN WHATEVER STATE OF THE UNION WAS HERE RAMPANT TO AN UNUSUAL DEGREE

CHEAP LANDS UNLIMITED TOWN LOTS ELIGIBLE TRADING SITES THE MULTITUDE OF FRANCHISES AND PRIVILEGES WITHIN THE CONTROL OF A TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE THE OFFICES TO BE DISTRIBUTED UNDER PARTY FAVORITISM OFFER AN ABUNDANT LURE TO ENTERPRISE AND FAR MORE TO CRAFT

COLFAX SPEECH IN H.R JUNE 21 1856 AFTER SO MUCH PATRIOTIC ENDEAVOR ON THE PART OF THESE BORDER RUFFIAN LEGISLATORS THAT THE UNION AND LAW MAY NOT BE TRAMPLED IN THE DUST IT CANNOT PERHAPS BE WONDERED AT THAT THEY BEGAN TO LOOK AROUND FOR THEIR PERSONAL REWARDS
THE POPULAR AGITATION OR WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY WHICH LED TO THE ARMED INSURRECTION WAS THREEFOLD
BUT THOSE WHO TAKE THIS VIEW FORGET THAT HE WAS WRITING TO AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF A MATTER WHICH HAD GREATLY OCCUPIED HIS OWN MIND FOR A YEAR

HE WAS A WHIG AND AS SUCH IN FAVOR OF INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS IN GENERAL AND A LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IN SUCH MATTERS

AS TO THE WHIG MEN WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE WAR SO FAR AS THEY HAVE SPOKEN TO MY HEARING THEY DO IS NOT HESITATE TO DENOUNCE AS UNJUST THE PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR
CONNECTICUT FOLLOWED IN HER FOOTSTEPS EARLY IN APRIL
AT THESE MEETINGS HE HAD AT LEAST A RESPECTFUL HEARING AND AS HE NEARED CENTRAL ILLINOIS THE RECEPTION ACCORDED HIM BECAME MORE ENTHUSIASTIC
IN LATER YEARS IT BECAME HIS DUTY TO GIVE AN OFFICIAL REPRIMAND TO A YOUNG OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN COURT-MARTIALED FOR A QUARREL WITH ONE OF HIS ASSOCIATES
HOUSTON UNDERTOOK TO TALK IT TO DEATH IN A LONG SPEECH
A PUBLIC OPINION NOT INDEED UNANIMOUS BUT LARGELY IN THE MAJORITY DEMANDED THAT THE NECESSARY EVIL SHOULD CEASE
IN THAT STRUGGLE HIS YOUTH OF REVERIES AND DAY-DREAMS PASSED AWAY
WE SHALL CARRY THIS COUNTY BY A LARGER MAJORITY THAN WE DID IN 1836 WHEN YOU RAN AGAINST MAY
IT WAS HOWEVER MERELY A CASUAL AND LOCAL AFFAIR AND WAS NOT DESCRIBED OR REPORTED BY THE NEWSPAPERS
IN THE OPINION OF MANY ILLINOISANS IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THE PLACE OF COMMISSIONER OF THE GENERAL LAND OFFICE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO A CITIZEN OF THEIR STATE ONE THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE LAND LAW IN THE WEST AND THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF THAT REGION
THE POLICY OF MY ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED BY ANY TIMID FOREBODINGS OF EVIL FROM EXPANSION
FROM THAT TIME FORWARD HE WAS A RECOGNIZED PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANT AND COMPETITOR YOUNG ENOUGH PATIENTLY TO BIDE HIS TIME AND OF SUFFICIENT PRESTIGE TO MAKE HIS FLAG THE RALLYING POINT OF ALL THE FREE-LANCES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

EVEN DENNIS HANKS SPEAKING OF HIS YOUTHFUL DAYS WHEN HIS ONLY HOME WAS THE HALF-FACED CAMP SAYS I TELL YOU BILLY I ENJOYED MYSELF BETTER THEN THAN I EVER HAVE SINCE BUT WE MAY DISTRUST THE REMINISCENCES OF OLD SETTLERS WHO SEE THEIR YOUTH IN THE FLATTERING LIGHT OF DISTANCE

HIS NAME IS PROMINENTLY CONNECTED WITH AN EVENT WHICH JUST AT THIS TIME CAUSED AN EXCITEMENT AND INTEREST IN SALEM AND THE NEIGHBORING TOWNS ENTIRELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS IMPORTANCE
SINCE HOWEVER THE REPEAL HAD SHAKEN BUT NOT OBLITERATED OLD PARTY LINES THIS EFFORT SUCCEEDED ONLY IN FAVORABLE LOCALITIES
THE FIRST OF ABOUT FORTY YEARS ENDING WITH HIS TERM IN CONGRESS
THE EXCITEMENT OCCASIONED BY THE TRIP OF THE TALISMAN HAD NOT YET DIED AWAY ALTHOUGH THE LITTLE STEAMER WAS NOW DUST AND ASHES AND HER BOLD COMMANDER HAD LEFT THE STATE TO AVOID AN AWKWARD MEETING WITH THE SHERIFF

MR DUBOIS SAYS
THERE WAS NO ROMANCE IN HIS THE PIONEER'S COMPOSITION
IN THE ORIGINAL DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE THOMAS JEFFERSON INVOKED THE REPROBATION OF MANKIND UPON THE BRITISH KING FOR HIS SHARE IN THIS INHUMAN TRAFFIC
AN IOWA SENATOR INTRODUCED A TERRITORIAL BILL
BUT THIS WAS ONLY TO BE MADE AFTER PEACEABLE REMEDIES SHALL FAIL THE FREE-STATE LEADERS DESERVE CREDIT FOR PURSUING THEIR PEACEABLE REMEDIES AND FORBEARING TO EXERCISE THEIR ASSERTED RIGHT TO RESISTANCE WITH A PATIENCE UNEXAMPLED IN AMERICAN ANNALS
WE MAY HAVE SAID THAT WE WOULD ASSIST ANY PROPER OFFICER IN THE SERVICE OF ANY LEGAL PROCESS THEY REPLIED STANDING UPON THEIR INTERPRETATION
WHEN AN OBJECT IS ARDENTLY DESIRED BY THE MAJORITY WHEN IT IS PRACTICABLE WHEN IT IS EXPEDIENT FOR THE MATERIAL WELFARE OF THE COUNTRY AND WHEN THE COST OF IT WILL FALL UPON OTHER PEOPLE IT MAY BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT--IN THE PRESENT CONDITION OF INTERNATIONAL ETHICS--THE PARTISANS OF THE PROJECT WILL NEVER LACK MEANS OF DEFENDING ITS MORALITY
THROUGH THE SPRING AND SUMMER OF 1836 THE TALK OF INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS GREW MORE GENERAL AND MORE CLAMOROUS
THE CHICAGO AMERICAN PEORIA REGISTER AND SANGAMO JOURNAL HAVE ALREADY HOISTED YOUR FLAG UPON THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY
THE LACK OF MORAL AND MENTAL SUSTENANCE WAS STILL MORE MARKED

REMOVAL OF THE CAPITAL TO SPRINGFIELD CHAPTER VIII
LINCOLN READILY FELL IN WITH THIS SUGGESTION AND ACCOMPANIED HIS FRIEND HOME WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ADJOURNED SHARING THE LODGING OF JOSHUA F
NOTHING BUT THIS
BANKS OF MASSACHUSETTS WAS CHOSEN SPEAKER BY 103 VOTES AGAINST 100 VOTES FOR WILLIAM AIKEN OF SOUTH CAROLINA WITH THIRTY SCATTERING
THERE WERE OF COURSE NO LOCKS ON THE CABIN DOORS AND THE EARLY MERCHANTS SOMETIMES LEFT THEIR STORES UNPROTECTED FOR DAYS TOGETHER WHEN THEY WENT TO THE NEAREST CITY TO REPLENISH THEIR STOCK
HE WAS ALWAYS READY WITH SOME KINDLY ACT OR WORD FOR OTHERS
THE GOODS SHE BROUGHT WITH HER COMPELLED SOME EFFORT AT HARMONY IN THE OTHER FITTINGS OF THE HOUSE
IN GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION IT EXTENDS FROM THE LATITUDE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW YORK TO THAT OF VIRGINIA AND KENTUCKY
THEY PREFERRED TO PASS THE FIRST YEARS OF THEIR OCCUPATION IN THE WASTEFUL AND LABORIOUS WORK OF CLEARING A PATCH OF TIMBER FOR CORN RATHER THAN ENTER UPON THOSE RICH SAVANNAS WHICH WERE READY TO BREAK INTO FERTILITY AT THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION OF CULTURE
FOR POSTMASTER HERE DR HENRY
LINCOLN WAS TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD
HE TOOK NO MEAN ADVANTAGES IN COURT OR IN CONVERSATION AND SATISFIED WITH THE RESPECT AND KINDLINESS WHICH HE EVERYWHERE MET HE SOUGHT NO QUARRELS AND SELDOM HAD TO DECLINE THEM
BUT AS ENOUGH DID NOT COME TO SATISFY THE INSATIABLE GREEDINESS OF THE CHICAGO SHARPERS AND SPECULATORS THEY FREQUENTLY CONSIGNED THEIR WARES TO EASTERN MARKETS
JONES SHERIFF OF DOUGLAS COUNTY KANSAS TERRITORY ALTHOUGH THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS AT THE TIME OF HIS APPOINTMENT AND LONG AFTERWARDS UNITED STATES POSTMASTER OF THE TOWN OF WESTPORT MISSOURI
IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED A DREARY VILLAGE TO ANY ONE ACCUSTOMED TO THE WORLD BUT IN A LETTER WRITTEN ABOUT THIS TIME LINCOLN SPEAKS OF IT AS A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF FLOURISHING ABOUT IN CARRIAGES A TOWN OF SOME PRETENTIOUS TO ELEGANCE

THE LEADING NAMES CASS BUCHANAN AND MARCY HAVING BEEN LONG BEFORE THE PUBLIC WERE BECOMING A LITTLE STALE
WE TALKED FOR SOME TIME AMICABLY AND SEPARATED
OF COURSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR REYNOLDS TO POLL A RESPECTABLE VOTE IF HIS LOYALTY TO JACKSON HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY DOUBTED
THE SANGUINE MOOD CONTINUED IN HIS NEXT LETTER MARCH 1
THE PLAN AND OBJECT OF THE MOVEMENT WERE IN GENERAL KEPT WELL CONCEALED
THERE WERE A FEW SETTLEMENTS IN THE FERTILE REGION CALLED THE MILITARY TRACT
AND THOUGH THE WHIGS DENOUNCED HIS SYSTEM AS SUBVERSIVE OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND PRIVATE JUDGMENT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY WERE ALSO FORCED TO ADOPT IT OR BE LEFT ALONE WITH THEIR VIRTUE
NOBODY KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH THE DISASTER EXCEPT THE BOW-OAR WHO IS DESCRIBED AS A GIGANTIC YOUTH WITH HIS TROUSERS ROLLED UP SOME FIVE FEET WHO WAS WADING ABOUT THE BOAT AND RIGGING UP SOME UNDESCRIBED CONTRIVANCE BY WHICH THE CARGO WAS UNLOADED THE BOAT TILTED AND THE WATER LET OUT BY BORING A HOLE THROUGH THE BOTTOM AND EVERYTHING BROUGHT SAFELY TO MOORINGS BELOW THE DAM
SO MUCH THAT ALTHOUGH IT TURNED OUT BETTER THAN I EXPECTED I HAVE HARDLY YET AT THE DISTANCE OF TEN HOURS BECOME CALM
THIS AMENDMENT EASED THE CONSCIENCE OF A FEW SHY SUPPORTERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION WHO HAD COMMITTED THEMSELVES VERY STRONGLY AGAINST THE SCHEME AND SAVED THEM FROM THE SHAME OF OPEN TERGIVERSATION
OFTEN BY GOOD LUCK OR PRUDENCE HE HAD THE FIELD ENTIRELY TO HIMSELF AND SO ESCAPED THE DANGERS AND DISCOURAGEMENTS OF A DECISIVE CONFLICT WITH A TRAINED ANTAGONIST ILLUSTRATION
THE EDGE OF THE TIMBER WAS EVERYWHERE PRETTY WELL OCCUPIED THOUGH THE IMMIGRANTS FROM THE FOREST STATES OF KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE HAD AS YET AVOIDED THE PRAIRIES
HE HAD 657 VOTES AND THERE WERE FIVE WHO FARED WORSE AMONG THEM HIS OLD ADVERSARY KIRKPATRICK
THIS WAS DONE AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CAME TOGETHER WITH ITS LARGE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY MR DOUGLAS HANDED IN A BILL REFORMING THE JUDICIARY--FOR THEY HAD LEARNED THAT SERVICEABLE WORD ALREADY
A FEW DAYS LATER IN A RUNNING DEBATE MR CALHOUN MADE AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT WHICH STILL FURTHER STRENGTHENED THE CONTENTION OF THE WHIGS
IF WE COULD GO BACK TO WHAT OUR FORE-FATHERS ENDURED IN CLEARING THE WESTERN WILDERNESS WE COULD THEN BETTER APPRECIATE OUR OBLIGATIONS TO THEM
THE ADDRESSES WHICH WERE SENT TO MR CLAY FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY INDICATE A DEPTH OF AFFECTIONATE DEVOTION WHICH RARELY FALLS TO THE LOT OF A POLITICAL CHIEFTAIN
BOTH MAJOR STUART AND JUDGE LOGAN FOOTNOTE
PETITIONS TO CONGRESS WHICH WERE MET BY GAG-LAWS CONSTANTLY INCREASING IN SEVERITY BROUGHT THE DREADED DISCUSSION MORE AND MORE BEFORE THE PUBLIC
MR LINCOLN WAS LOVED BY HIS BRETHREN OF THE BAR AND NO BODY OF MEN WILL GRIEVE MORE AT HIS DEATH OR PAY MORE SINCERE TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY
IN NO QUALITY OF WISE WOODCRAFT WAS HE WANTING

DANIEL MACE PAGE 829 HOUSE REPORT NO
HIS OLDEST CHILD SARAH FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE THREE YEARS LATER
A MIDDLE PARTY THEREUPON SPRANG UP PROPOSING TO DIVIDE THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE BETWEEN FREEDOM AND SLAVERY BY THE LINE OF 36 DEGREES 30 AND AUTHORIZING THE ADMISSION OF MISSOURI WITH SLAVERY OUT OF THE NORTHERN HALF
BUT UNDER DOMINANT POLITICAL INFLUENCES THE LATTER WAS ITS EVIDENT AND CERTAIN OBJECT
ACCOMPANYING THIS FLOOD OF EMIGRANTS OF GOOD FAITH WAS THE USUAL FROTH AND SCUM OF SHIFTLESS IDLERS AND ADVENTURERS WHO WERE EITHER DRIFTING WITH A CURRENT THEY WERE TOO WORTHLESS TO WITHSTAND OR IN PURSUIT OF DISHONEST GAINS IN FRESHER AND SIMPLER REGIONS
HOWEVER THE OFFICE IS LOCATED HERE AT SPRINGFIELD
HE HAD NO MONOPOLY OF THIS ISSUE IT FORMED THE BURDEN OF NEARLY EVERY CANDIDATE'S APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE IN THAT YEAR
THEY ARE FILLED MOSTLY WITH REMARKS ABOUT CURRENT POLITICS AND WITH ARGUMENTS GOING TO SHOW THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT MARRY HIM
THE LATE BUT SPLENDID MATURITY OF LINCOLN'S MIND AND CHARACTER DATES FROM THIS TIME AND ALTHOUGH HE GREW IN STRENGTH AND KNOWLEDGE TO THE END FROM THIS YEAR WE OBSERVE A STEADINESS AND SOBRIETY OF THOUGHT AND PURPOSE AS DISCERNIBLE IN HIS LIFE AS IN HIS STYLE
IT IS AS USELESS AS IT WOULD BE INDELICATE TO SEEK TO PENETRATE IN DETAIL THE INCIDENTS AND SPECIAL CAUSES WHICH PRODUCED IN HIS MIND THIS DARKNESS AS OF THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH
TITUS OF FLORIDA

THE PIONEERS OF ILLINOIS BROUGHT WITH THEM THE SAME RIGID NOTIONS OF HONESTY WHICH THEIR ENVIRONMENT MAINTAINED
THEIR LEADERS WERE IMPRISONED OR SCATTERED THEIR PRESSES DESTROYED THEIR ADHERENTS DISPIRITED WITH DEFEAT
AS SOON AS THE WAR WAS ENDED AND THE TREATY OF PEACE WAS SENT TO THE SENATE THIS SUBJECT ASSUMED A NEW INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE AND A RESOLUTION EMBODYING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WILMOT PROVISO WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE HOUSE BY MR HARVEY PUTNAM OF NEW YORK BUT NO LONGER WITH THE SAME SUCCESS
I MADE THE CANVASS ON MY OWN HORSE
JUDGE LOGAN SAW LINCOLN FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE DAY WHEN HE CAME UP TO SPRINGFIELD ON HIS CANVASS THIS SUMMER
THE EMIGRANT AID COMPANY
I ACCEPTED HIS INVITATION AND RODE OUT WITH HIM
HALE WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT DAVID WILMOT AND THEIR LIKE WENT OUT OF THEIR PARTY THEY LEFT A VACANCY WHICH WAS NEVER TO BE FILLED
DOUGLAS'S SPEECH WAS DOUBTLESS INTENDED BY HIM AND EXPECTED BY HIS FRIENDS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL AND THE CONCLUSIVE ARGUMENT OF THE OCCASION
IT IS ONLY THE NAME WHICH RISES INTO HISTORICAL NOTICE
A PACKAGE OF LETTERS WRITTEN DURING THE PRELIMINARY CANVASS WHICH HAVE RECENTLY COME INTO OUR HANDS SHOW HOW INTELLIGENT AND HOW STRAIGHTFORWARD HE WAS IN THE WAYS OF POLITICS
HIS MIND AND MINE--WHAT LITTLE I HAD--SEEMED TO RUN TOGETHER
THE WESTERN BORDER WAS ASTIR AND WILD VISIONS OF LANDS AND CITIES AND MINES AND WEALTH AND POWER WERE DISTURBING THE DREAMS OF THE PIONEER IN HIS FRONTIER CABIN AND HURRYING HIM OFF ON THE LONG ROMANTIC QUEST ACROSS THE CONTINENT
THERE WAS SO MUCH OF IDIOSYNCRASY IN IT THAT IT HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FOR YEARS TO COME THE OCCASION OF ENDLESS GOSSIP IN SANGAMON COUNTY AND ELSEWHERE
TAMPERING WITH THE JUDICIARY CHAPTER X
HIS PERSUASIVE AND CONVINCING ORATORY WAS THOUGHT SO USEFUL TO HIS PARTY THAT EVERY FOUR YEARS HE WAS SENT IN THE CHARACTER OF ELECTORAL CANVASSER TO THE REMOTEST REGIONS OF THE STATE TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN DIALECT WITH THEIR OWN HABITS OF THOUGHT AND FEELING IN FAVOR OF THE WHIG CANDIDATE
WELL I MADE A BIG SPEECH WHICH IS IN PROGRESS OF PRINTING IN PAMPHLET FORM
THE VICE-PRESIDENCY WAS VACANT
DESPOTIC STATUTES
THE TEXANS WERE NOT AN ALIEN PEOPLE
IT IS JUSTLY FAMED FOR MANY OF ITS PROVISIONS
YANKEE INGENUITY HAD INVENTED A NEW KIND OF BREECH-LOADING GUN CALLED SHARPS RIFLE IT WAS IN FACT THE BEST WEAPON OF ITS DAY
HIS UNUSUAL COMMON-SENSE BEGAN TO BE RECOGNIZED
IN BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS IN THE CABINETS OF TWO PRESIDENTS IN DIPLOMATIC DEALINGS WITH FOREIGN POWERS EVERY STEP OF ITS PROGRESS MARKED BY FALSE PROFESSIONS BY BROKEN PLEDGES BY A STEADY DEGRADATION OF MORAL FIBER AMONG ALL THOSE ENGAGED IN THE SCHEME
WHETHER I SHALL EVER BE BETTER I CANNOT TELL
HIS FIRST PARTICIPATION IN DEBATE CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED IN HIS OWN QUAINT AND SIMPLE WORDS
BENTON THIRTY YEARS VIEW THESE FANCIFUL PROPHECIES OF EVIL WERE PRIVATELY CIRCULATED FOR A YEAR AMONG THOSE WHOM THEY WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO INFLUENCE AND THE ENTIRE LETTER WAS PRINTED IN 1844 WITH A RESULT NEVER INTENDED BY THE WRITER
THERE WAS SCARCELY A MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM ILLINOIS--INDEED SCARCELY A PROMINENT MAN IN THE STATE OF ANY PARTY--WHO DID NOT CONCEIVE THE FLATTERING DREAM THAT HE HIMSELF MIGHT BECOME THE LUCKY MEDIUM OF COMPROMISE AND HARMONY
INDEED SAYS ONE OF HIS COLLEAGUES HIS STATEMENT OFTEN RENDERED ARGUMENT UNNECESSARY AND OFTEN THE COURT WOULD STOP HIM AND SAY IF THAT IS THE CASE WE WILL HEAR THE OTHER SIDE SIDENOTE
YOU ARE NOW IN NEED OF SOME MONEY
THAT WE HAVE HAD NO THEORY TO ESTABLISH NO PERSONAL GRUDGE TO GRATIFY NO UNAVOWED OBJECTS TO SUBSERVE
CIVILIZATION CAME IN WITH A REASONABLY FULL EQUIPMENT AT THE BEGINNING
HE HAD EVEN THEN CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN SPEAKING AND THINKING ON HIS FEET
MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL PERHAPS WAS THE PRESENCE AND ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF EX-GOVERNOR REEDER HIMSELF WHO WROTE THE RESOLUTIONS ADDRESSED THE CONVENTION IN A STIRRING AND DEFIANT SPEECH AND RECEIVED BY ACCLAMATION THEIR NOMINATION FOR TERRITORIAL DELEGATE
I CAN CONCEIVE OF NO REASON FOR THIS PREFERENCE UNLESS IT BE SUPPOSED THAT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF MISSOURI HAVE NEGROES TO WORK FOR THEM THEY ARE TO BE CONSIDERED AS GENTLEFOLKS ENTITLED TO HIGHER CONSIDERATION THAN US PLAIN FREE-STATE FOLKS WHO HAVE TO WORK FOR OURSELVES THE ATTEMPT WAS AT LAST SERIOUSLY MADE TO OPEN THE STATE TO SLAVERY BY THE LEGISLATURE OF 1822-3

ON THE WEST WILL BE SEEN THE BOUNDARIES CLAIMED BY MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES AFTER THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS

RUM 183/4
THESE FAILING TO ARRIVE IN TIME THE GOVERNOR WAS OBLIGED TO FACE HIS OWN DILEMMA
NEVERTHELESS THE EFFORTS OF THE FREE-STATE PARTY TINDER THIS COMBINATION WERE NOT WHOLLY BARREN
UNPROPITIOUS WEATHER HAD BROUGHT THE MEETING TO THE REPRESENTATIVES HALL IN THE STATE HOUSE WHICH WAS DENSELY PACKED
THOUGH HIS NOTIONS OF POLITICS LIKE THOSE OF ANY ILL-EDUCATED YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY-TWO MUST HAVE BEEN RATHER CRUDE AND NOT AT ALL SUFFICIENT TO LIVE AND TO DIE BY HE HAD ADOPTED THEM HONESTLY AND SINCERELY WITH NO SELFISH REGARD TO HIS OWN INTERESTS
THERE WERE OF COURSE NO PAVEMENTS OR SIDEWALKS
THEY WERE PROMPTLY ACCEPTED AND RATIFIED AND IN THE LAST DAYS OF 1845 TEXAS WAS FORMALLY ADMITTED INTO THE UNION AS A STATE
THERE WERE SEVERAL LARGE BRICK BUILDINGS AT THE MISSION CAPABLE OF ACCOMMODATING THE LEGISLATURE WITH HALLS AND LODGING-ROOMS
MAINE AND MISSOURI WERE BOTH ADMITTED
WHILE SIX WEEKS AFTER THE INAUGURATION THE AMERICAN MASTERS HEADED BY JEFFERSON DAVIS BEGAN THE GREATEST WAR OF MODERN TIMES TO PERPETUATE AND SPREAD THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY
WHAT PETER THE GREAT DID TO MAKE RUSSIA DOMINANT ELI WHITNEY'S INVENTION OF THE COTTON-GIN HAS MORE THAN EQUALED IN ITS RELATION TO THE POWER AND PROGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES HE HAS BEEN THE GREATEST BENEFACTOR OF THE SOUTH BUT IT NEVER HAS TO MY KNOWLEDGE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS BENEFACTION IN A PUBLIC MANNER TO THE EXTENT IT DESERVES--NO MONUMENT HAS BEEN ERECTED TO HIS MEMORY NO TOWN OR CITY NAMED AFTER HIM THOUGH THE FORCE OF HIS GENIUS HAS ORIGINAL INVENTION
IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE CANNOT BE REPEALED
THE NINE MILES OF WALKING DOUBTLESS SEEMED TO THOMAS LINCOLN A WASTE OF TIME AND THE LAD WAS PUT AT STEADY WORK AND SAW NO MORE OF SCHOOL
THE TAUNTS OF THE PARTY IN POWER WHEN HARRISON'S NOMINATION WAS FIRST MENTIONED THEIR SNEERS AT HARD CIDER AND LOG-CABINS HAD BEEN DEXTEROUSLY ADOPTED AS THE SLOGAN OF THE OPPOSITION AND GAVE RISE TO THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF THAT EXTRAORDINARY CAMPAIGN
WE HAVE A MEMORANDUM IN MR LINCOLN'S OWN HANDWRITING IN WHICH HE SAYS HE RAN AS AN AVOWED CLAY MAN IN ONE OF THE FEW SPEECHES OF HIS WHICH MADE AT THIS TIME HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED AND REPORTED HE SAID
SO LATE AS THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY HE DID NOT SHARE THE BELIEF OF HIS SUPPORTERS THAT HE WAS TO BE NOMINATED WITHOUT A CONTEST
IN THE THIRD THERE WERE BUT TWO FAMILIES AT THE COUNTY-SEAT AND NO CASES ON THE DOCKET
TO PROHIBIT THE ADMISSION OF ANY MORE SLAVE STATES
BUT ON THE 6TH OF MAY THE WILLIAM WALLACE ARRIVED AND THIS SIGHT SAYS THE GOVERNOR WITH CHARACTERISTIC SINCERITY WAS I PRESUME THE MOST INTERESTING I EVER BEHELD FROM THERE THEY MARCHED TO THE MOUTH OF ROCK RIVER AND THENCE GENERAL WHITESIDES PROCEEDED WITH HIS VOLUNTEERS UP THE RIVER SOME NINETY MILES TO DIXON WHERE THEY HALTED TO AWAIT THE ARRIVAL OF GENERAL ATKINSON WITH THE REGULAR TROOPS AND PROVISIONS
FOR THIS PURPOSE COMPETITION FROM THE OLDER TOWNS YIELDING GRACEFULLY AFTER THE FIRST BALLOT AN ENTIRELY NEW SITE ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE OVERLOOKING THE KANSAS RIVER SOME TWELVE MILES WEST OF LAWRENCE WAS AGREED UPON
IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT THIS FREE-STATE MOVEMENT ORIGINATED IN DEMOCRATIC CIRCLES UNDER DEMOCRATIC AUSPICES
BUT THE OPPOSITION HAD ONLY A MAJORITY OF ONE OR TWO
ITS SCRIP WAS NEVER REDEEMED
HE SEIZED AN OCCASION WHICH WAS OFFERED HIM TO GO TO WASHINGTON AS BEARER OF DISPATCHES AND WHILE THERE HE MADE ONE OF THOSE SUDDEN AND DRAMATIC APPEARANCES IN THE CAPITOL WHICH WERE SO MUCH IN HARMONY WITH HIS TASTES AND HIS CHARACTER
MANY YEARS AFTER HIM THE GREATEST OF ALL VIRGINIANS CROSSED THE MOUNTAINS AGAIN AND BECAME HEAVILY INTERESTED IN THOSE SCHEMES OF EMIGRATION WHICH FILLED THE MINDS OF MANY OF THE LEADING MEN IN AMERICA UNTIL THEY WERE DRIVEN OUT BY GRAVER CARES AND MORE IMPERATIVE DUTIES
TO BERRY THE BUSINESS WAS MERELY THE REFUGE OF IDLENESS
IT WAS CHARGED AT THE TIME AND SOME RECENT WRITERS HAVE REPEATED THE CHARGE THAT THERE WAS A BARGAIN MADE IN 1840 BETWEEN HARDIN BAKER LINCOLN AND LOGAN TO SUCCEED EACH OTHER IN THE ORDER NAMED
GOVERNOR JOHN REYNOLDS SPEAKS OF THE PANIC FELT IN HIS FATHER'S FAMILY WHEN THE AXE WAS DROPPED INTO A STREAM
THE FREE-STATE MEN HAVE RECORDED THE HONORABLE CONDUCT OF COLONEL ZADOCK JACKSON OF GEORGIA AND COLONEL JEFFERSON BUFORD OF ALABAMA AS WELL AS OF THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY OF THE COUNTY EACH OF WHOM DENOUNCED THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE SPOT
ITS OFFICERS NEVER BECAME CLOTHED WITH OFFICIAL AUTHORITY
HE HAD GROWN BY THIS TIME THOROUGHLY AT HOME IN POLITICAL CONTROVERSY AND HE HAD THE PLEASURE OF FREQUENTLY MEETING MR DOUGLAS IN ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE DEBATE IN VARIOUS TOWNS OF THE STATE AS THEY FOLLOWED JUDGE TREAT ON HIS CIRCUIT
BUT AFTER PIERCE WAS TRIUMPHANTLY ELECTED WITH A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS TO SUSTAIN HIM THE LEGISLATIVE CALM WHICH BOTH PARTIES HAD ADJURED IN THEIR PLATFORMS SEEMED FAVORABLE FOR PUSHING MEASURES OF LOCAL INTEREST
FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEY HAD BEEN TINKERING AT FIRST MODESTLY AND TENTATIVELY AT A SCHEME OF INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS WHICH SHOULD NOT COST TOO MUCH MONEY
NAMELY BECAUSE OF A VIVA VOCE VOTE CERTIFIED INSTEAD OF A BALLOT AND BECAUSE THE PRESCRIBED OATH AND THE WORDS LAWFUL RESIDENT VOTERS HAD BEEN OPENLY ERASED FROM THE PRINTED FORMS

AGAINST THIS EXILE HOWEVER STRINGFELLOW AND HIS BORDER RUFFIAN LAWMAKERS PROTESTED IN AN ENERGETIC MEMORIAL ASKING TO BE CALLED TOGETHER AT THE SHAWNEE MISSION SUPPLEMENTED BY THE PRIVATE THREAT THAT EVEN IF THEY CONVENED AT PAWNEE THEY WOULD ADJOURN AND COME BACK THE DAY AFTER
THE LEGISLATURE REMITTED THE FINE BUT THE CIRCUIT COURT DECLARED IT HAD NO CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO DO SO THOUGH THE SUPREME COURT AFTERWARDS OVERRULED THIS DECISION
THEIR SUMMERS WERE PASSED IN THE SOLITUDE OF THE WOODS
THE ONLY SERIOUS COMPETITORS FOR THE NOMINATION WERE THE OLD FOGIES CASS MARCY AND BUCHANAN ON THE ONE HAND AND DOUGLAS THE PET OF YOUNG AMERICA ON THE OTHER
THE PROBABILITY THAT WE MAY FALL IN THE STRUGGLE OUGHT NOT TO DETER US FROM THE SUPPORT OF A CAUSE WE BELIEVE TO BE JUST

TO STIFLE ANY SUCH MOVEMENT BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE ON THE LAST NIGHT OF THEIR SESSION ADOPTED A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION DECLARING THAT THE PROPOSITION TO ORGANIZE A NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVING ALREADY MISLED SOME OF THEIR FRIENDS WOULD DIVIDE PRO-SLAVERY WHIGS FROM DEMOCRATS AND WEAKEN THEIR PARTY ONE-HALF
IT WAS IN SHORT A RATTLING STUMP SPEECH OF THE KIND THEN UNIVERSALLY POPULAR IN THE WEST AND WHICH IS STILL CONSIDERED A VERY HIGH GRADE OF ELOQUENCE IN THE SOUTH
IT WAS A PECULIARITY OF THE EARLY WEST--PERHAPS IT PERTAINS TO ALL PRIMITIVE COMMUNITIES--THAT THE PEOPLE RETAINED A CERTAIN FRAGMENT OF THE CHIVALRIC SENTIMENT A REMNANT OF THE INSTINCT OF HERO-WORSHIP
I HAVE NO HESITATION IN SAYING THAT FAR FROM HAVING ANY PERSONAL OBJECTIONS TO THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE IT--WITHOUT DISHONOR WITHOUT WAR WITH THE COMMON CONSENT OF THE UNION AND UPON JUST AND FAIR TERMS
BAKER MANY WERE THE SCHEMES DEVISED FOR MEETING THESE OPPRESSIVE OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT UNDULY TAXING THE VOTERS
THERE WERE RUMORS OF COMING TROUBLE AND OF AN UNHEALTHY CONDITION OF THE BANKS
HE INVENTED A SYSTEM--WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS ADOPTED BY MANY WHOSE BREECHES WERE MORE FASHIONABLY CUT--OF VOTING AGAINST EVERY MEASURE WHICH WAS PROPOSED
HIS ADVICE WAS NEVER REJECTED WITHOUT DISASTER NOR FOLLOWED BUT WITH ADVANTAGE
AS IT IS THE ONLY ONE OF LINCOLN'S POPULAR SPEECHES OF THAT PERIOD WHICH HAS BEEN PRESERVED ENTIRE IT SHOULD BE READ BY THOSE WHO DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE MANNER AND SPIRIT OF THE POLITICS OF 1848
EXTRAVAGANT RUMORS WERE NOW CIRCULATED AS TO THE PLANS AND NUMBERS OF THE EASTERN EMIGRANTS
THE WHIGS WERE RECOVERING FROM THE NUMBNESS INTO WHICH THEY HAD FALLEN DURING THE TIME OF JACKSON'S IMPERIOUS PREDOMINANCE AND IN THE NEW PROSPECT OF SUCCESS THEY FELT ALL THE EXCITEMENT OF PROSPEROUS REBELS
A DOG CROSSING THE HUNTER'S PATH SPOILED HIS DAY UNLESS HE INSTANTLY HOOKED HIS LITTLE FINGERS TOGETHER AND PULLED TILL THE ANIMAL DISAPPEARED
HIS BUBBLING HUMOR HIS PERFECT TEMPER AND ABOVE ALL THE OVERWHELMING CURRENT OF HIS HISTORICAL ARRAIGNMENT EXTORTED THE ADMIRATION OF EVEN HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES
BUT IN 1828 AN OPPORTUNITY OFFERED FOR A LITTLE GLIMPSE OF THE WORLD OUTSIDE AND THE BOY GLADLY EMBRACED IT
AND THE RETURNS IN THESE CASES HE REJECTED NOT BECAUSE OF ALLEGED FORCE OR FRAUD BUT ON ACCOUNT OF PALPABLE DEFECTS IN THE PAPERS
SOMETIMES WE SAW HUNDREDS IN A DROVE AND THE NUMBERS ABOUT THE SALT SPRINGS WERE AMAZING IN THE COURSE OF THE WINTER HOWEVER HE WAS CAPTURED BY THE INDIANS WHILE HUNTING WITH A COMRADE AND WHEN THEY HAD CONTRIVED TO ESCAPE THEY NEVER FOUND AGAIN ANY TRACE OF THE REST OF THEIR PARTY

AS THESE RESOLUTIONS BECAME SOMEWHAT FAMOUS AFTERWARDS AND WERE RELIED UPON TO SUSTAIN THE CHARGE OF A LACK OF PATRIOTISM MADE BY MR DOUGLAS AGAINST THEIR AUTHOR IT MAY BE AS WELL TO GIVE THEM HERE ESPECIALLY AS THEY ARE THE FIRST PRODUCTION OF MR LINCOLN'S PEN AFTER HIS ENTRY UPON THE FIELD OF NATIONAL POLITICS

IN HIS SUBSEQUENT ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM HE HAD COME TO RECOGNIZE AND RESPECT HIS ABILITIES HIS UNPRETENDING COMMON SENSE AND HIS INNATE INTEGRITY

TWO OF HIS MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS WERE THE BROTHERS HERNDON CALLED ACCORDING TO THE FASHION OF THE TIME WHICH HELD IT UNFRIENDLY TO GIVE A MAN HIS PROPER NAME AND ARROGANT FOR HIM TO CLAIM IT ROW AND JIM THEY KEPT ONE OF THOSE GROCERY STORES IN WHICH EVERYTHING SALABLE ON THE FRONTIER WAS SOLD AND WHICH SEEM TO HAVE CHANGED THEIR OCCUPANTS AS RAPIDLY AS SENTRY-BOXES
LINCOLN SAW IT
BUT AS YET THE NEW PARTY WAS MERELY INCHOATE ITS ELEMENTS DISTRUSTFUL JEALOUS AND DISCORDANT
WHILE THUS IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF ILLINOIS THE PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF DOUGLAS'S REPEAL WAS IMMEDIATE AND SWEEPING THE FORMATION OF OPPOSITION TO IT WAS TENTATIVE AND SLOW IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN COUNTIES WHERE AMONG WHIGS OF SOUTHERN BIRTH IT PROCEEDED RATHER UPON PARTY FEELING THAN UPON MORAL CONVICTION
IT WAS ONCE MORE INCORPORATED FEBRUARY 21 1855 UNDER THE NAME OF THE NEW ENGLAND EMIGRANT AID COMPANY AND IN THIS CONDITION IT BECAME VIRTUALLY THE WORKING AGENCY OF PHILANTHROPIC CITIZENS OF NEW ENGLAND HEADED BY ELI THAYER
THE LEGISLATURE WAS STILL STIFF-NECKED AND PERVERSE IN REGARD TO THE SYSTEM
HE WAS POISONED WITH THE ENERVATING MALARIA OF THE WESTERN WOODS AS ALL HIS FELLOWS WERE AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF IT WERE SEEN IN HIS CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO THE CLOSE OF HIS LIFE
INGERSOLL ONE OF THE LEADING MEN UPON THAT SIDE IN CONGRESS IN A SPEECH THREE YEARS BEFORE HAD SAID
AND DEPEND UPON IT HE ADDED IN THE AMAZING IMPUDENCE OF TRIUMPH I WOULD HAVE KEPT THAT VOW REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES
USING THE FAVORITE ARGUMENT OF THE SOUTHERNERS OF HIS SCHOOL HE SAID
BUT FOR A GOOD WHILE IT WAS ONLY THE WOMEN WHO INDULGED IN THESE NOVELTIES
EARLY IN THE YEAR 1780 THREE HUNDRED LARGE FAMILY BOATS ARRIVED AT THE FALLS OF THE OHIO WHERE THE LAND HAD BEEN SURVEYED BY CAPTAIN BULLITT SEVEN YEARS BEFORE AND IN MAY THE LEGISLATURE OF VIRGINIA PASSED A LAW FOR THE INCORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF LOUISVILLE THEN CONTAINING SOME SIX HUNDRED INHABITANTS
AND WHEN A FEW DAYS LATER SAMUEL HOUSTON AND HIS EIGHT HUNDRED RAW LEVIES DEFEATED AND DESTROYED THE MEXICAN ARMY AT SAN JACINTO CAPTURED SANTA ANNA THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT AND WITH AMERICAN THRIFT INSTEAD OF GIVING HIM THE DEATH HE MERITED FOR HIS CRUEL MURDER OF UNARMED PRISONERS SAVED HIM TO MAKE A TREATY WITH THE WHOLE PEOPLE RECOGNIZED SOMETHING OF KINSHIP IN THE UNAFFECTED VALOR WITH WHICH THESE BORDERERS DIED AND THE HUMOROUS SHREWDNESS WITH WHICH THEY BARGAINED AND FELT AS IF THE VICTORY OVER THE MEXICANS WERE THEIR OWN
WHENEVER NIGHTFALL CAME WITH THE MAN OF THE HOUSE AWAY FROM HOME THE ANXIETY AND CARE OF THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE NONE THE LESS BITTER BECAUSE SO COMMON

BUT WHEN GENERAL TAYLOR AND GENERAL AMPUDIA CONFRONTED EACH OTHER WITH HOSTILE GUNS ACROSS THE RIO GRANDE AND STILL MORE AFTER THE BRILLIANT FEAT OF ARMS BY WHICH THE AMERICANS OPENED THE WAR ON THE PLAIN OF PALO ALTO IT REQUIRED A GOOD DEAL OF MORAL COURAGE ON THE PART OF THE CANDIDATES AND VOTERS ALIKE TO CONTINUE THEIR ATTITUDE OF DISAPPROVAL OF THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY WERE SHOUTING PAEANS OVER THE EXPLOITS OF OUR SOLDIERS
DIXON'S REPEALING AMENDMENT
EVEN HIS HONORABLE WOUNDS IN BATTLE WHILE THEY WERE PRODUCTIVE OF GREAT PUBLIC APPLAUSE AND POLITICAL SUCCESS GAINED HIM SCARCELY LESS RIDICULE THAN PRAISE

BY THE TREATY OF PEACE OF 1848 THE MEXICANS RELINQUISHED TO THE UNITED STATES THE TERRITORY BETWEEN THE NUECES AND THE RIO GRANDE DEL NORTE
BUT THIS YEAR THEY COMPLETELY DEFEATED THEIR OPPONENTS AND GAINED THAT CONTROL OF THE COUNTY WHICH THEY NEVER LOST AS LONG AS THE PARTY ENDURED
THEY BASED THEIR APPEAL MORE ESPECIALLY UPON THE OPINION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE CASE OF ARKANSAS THAT CITIZENS OF TERRITORIES POSSESS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE AND PETITION CONGRESS FOR THE REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES
AN ANSWER WAS PROBABLY NOT EXPECTED
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS WAS THE FIVE-HUNDRED-ACRE TRACT FOUND IN BOONE'S FIELD-BOOK IN THE POSSESSION OF LYMAN C

SOMETHING LIKE IT IS TOLD AND MORE OR LESS BELIEVED IN HALF THE DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTRY AT EVERY ELECTION
WHEN IT FINALLY BECAME A QUESTION TO BE DECIDED PERHAPS BY A SINGLE FRONTIER ELECTION HIS ZEAL AND WORK IN THAT BEHALF WERE MANY TIMES MULTIPLIED
THE MARCHING OF AN ARMY INTO THE MIDST OF A PEACEFUL MEXICAN SETTLEMENT FRIGHTENING THE INHABITANTS AWAY LEAVING THEIR GROWING CROPS AND OTHER PROPERTY TO DESTRUCTION TO YOU MAY APPEAR A PERFECTLY AMIABLE PEACEFUL UNPROVOKING PROCEDURE
BUT THE EIGHT WHO TOOK THE STUMP IN SANGAMON IN THE SUMMER OF 1836 WERE SUPPORTED AS LOYALLY AND AS ENERGETICALLY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN NOMINATED WITH ALL THE SOLEMNITY OF MODERN DAYS
FEBRUARY 11 1856
HE WAS URGED TO ORDER THE IMMEDIATE ELECTION OF A TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE
THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT IT WAS ON ACCOUNT OF HIS ASSOCIATION WITH THE FAMOUS DANIEL BOONE THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WENT TO KENTUCKY
BUT AS IT MAY BE OBJECTED THAT THE FRIENDSHIP WHICH UNITED DAVIS AND LINCOLN RENDERED THE ONE INCAPABLE OF A JUST JUDGMENT UPON THE MERITS OF THE OTHER WE WILL ALSO GIVE AN EXTRACT FROM THE ADDRESS DELIVERED IN CHICAGO BY ONE OF THE ABLEST AND MOST IMPARTIAL LAWYERS WHO HAVE EVER HONORED THE BAR AND THE BENCH IN THE WEST

DOUGLAS OF ILLINOIS
HE TOOK DELIBERATE AIM AT A WHITE ORNAMENT ON THE BREAST OF THE SAVAGE AND BROUGHT HIM DOWN
THE PEOPLE OF THE MISSOURI AND IOWA BORDER WERE BECOMING EVERY DAY MORE IMPATIENT TO ENTER UPON AN AUTHORIZED OCCUPANCY OF THE NEW LANDS WHICH LAY A DAY'S JOURNEY TO THE WEST

ARNOLD IN THE HISTORY OF SANGAMON COUNTY THE OUTWARD FORM AND FASHION OF EVERY INSTITUTION CHANGE RAPIDLY IN GROWING COMMUNITIES LIKE OUR WESTERN STATES AND THE PRACTICE OF THE LAW HAD ALREADY ASSUMED A VERY DIFFERENT DEGREE OF DIGNITY AND FORMALITY FROM THAT WHICH IT PRESENTED ONLY TWENTY YEARS BEFORE
HE WAS EVERYBODY'S FRIEND AND YET USED NO LIQUOR OR TOBACCO
LINCOLN ROSE AND WENT TO HIS HOTEL IN DEEP DISGUST
ONE OF HIS CANDID REMARKS IS REMEMBERED AND RECORDED
AN ELECTION FOR COUNTY COMMISSIONERS WAS ORDERED
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE SOCIAL INTERCOURSE
HE WAS TOO MUCH GIVEN TO SCRIBBLING COARSE SATIRES AND CHRONICLES IN PROSE AND IN SOMETHING WHICH HAD TO HIM AND HIS FRIENDS THE AIR OF VERSE
HE NEVER ASKED FOR HELP BUT WAS ALWAYS READY TO GIVE IT
A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THE ELECTION THE WHOLE MISSOURI BORDER WAS ASTIR
HE CONTINUED HIS STUDIES OF THE LAW AND SURVEYING TOGETHER AND BECAME QUITE INDISPENSABLE IN THE LATTER CAPACITY--SO MUCH SO THAT GENERAL NEALE ANNOUNCING IN SEPTEMBER 1835 THE NAMES OF THE DEPUTY SURVEYORS OF SANGARNON COUNTY PLACED THE NAME OF LINCOLN BEFORE THAT OF HIS OLD MASTER IN THE SCIENCE JOHN CALHOUN
HE THEN AVOWS WITH CHARACTERISTIC CANDOR THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT GENERAL TAYLOR WILL DO AS TO SLAVERY
HAVING THUS EXPRESSED THEIR DETERMINATION TO VINDICATE THE LAW THEY HELD A MEETING AND CITED HIM BEFORE IT TO DECLARE HIS INTENTIONS
THE FREE-STATE HOTEL SERVED AS BARRACKS
30 SIDENOTE
HE DIED A SENATOR AT SEVENTY-FIVE AND FOR THE GREATER PART OF THAT LONG INTERVAL HE WAS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PERSONAL INFLUENCE IN AMERICAN POLITICS
STILL I WISH YOU ALL IN TAZEWELL TO KEEP YOUR EYES CONTINUALLY ON WOODFORD AND MARSHALL
I OPPOSED THE WAR NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EASILY AVOIDED
HIS SYSTEM OF FUTURE REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS WAS OF THE MOST SIMPLE AND CONCRETE CHARACTER AND FORMED THE STAPLE OF HIS SERMONS
HE SETTLED IN MACON COUNTY AND WAS SO WELL PLEASED WITH THE COUNTRY AND ESPECIALLY WITH ITS ADMIRABLE DISTRIBUTION INTO PRAIRIE AND TIMBER THAT HE SENT REPEATED MESSAGES TO HIS FRIENDS IN INDIANA TO COME OUT AND JOIN HIM

AT THIS POINT RICHARDSON FINDING IT A HOPELESS STRUGGLE WITHDREW HIS NAME AS A CANDIDATE AND THE DEMOCRATIC STRENGTH WAS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER BUT WITH NO BETTER PROSPECTS
SCARCELY A CORPORAL'S GUARD LEFT THE DISCUSSION
BUT LINCOLN STANDING UNDISMAYED WITH HIS BACK TO THE WALL LOOKED SO FORMIDABLE IN HIS DEFIANCE THAT AN HONEST ADMIRATION TOOK THE PLACE OF MOMENTARY FURY AND HIS INITIATION WAS OVER
THE LAND LAWS OF KENTUCKY HAD REDUCED TO SOMETHING LIKE ORDER THE CHAOS OF CONFLICTING CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE VARIOUS GRANTS AND THE DIFFERENT PREEMPTION CUSTOMS UNDER WHICH SETTLERS OCCUPIED THEIR PROPERTY
SAID NOTHING MUCH WAS SILENT LOOKED BAD
THE FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS THE PRESENCE AND HEARTY ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS FRIENDS PUT LINCOLN IN HIS BEST VEIN
THE NORTH CONTENDED THAT CONGRESS MIGHT AND SHOULD PROHIBIT SLAVERY IN ALL THE TERRITORIES OF THE UNION AS HAD BEEN DONE IN THE NORTHERN HALF BY THE ORDINANCE OF 1787 AND BY THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE

AND NEGRO TROOPS FOUGHT IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR FOR AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE
LET NONE ATTEMPT IT
AT THE CLOSE OF THAT REPLY AND JUST BEFORE DOUGLAS'S REJOINDER LOVEJOY HAD ANNOUNCED TO THE AUDIENCE THAT A REPUBLICAN STATE CONVENTION WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY HELD IN THE SENATE CHAMBER EXTENDING AN INVITATION TO DELEGATES TO JOIN IN IT
HE CLAIMED THAT THE SLAVERY QUESTION WAS FOREVER SETTLED BY HIS GREAT PRINCIPLE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY WHICH TOOK IT OUT OF CONGRESS AND GAVE IT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE TERRITORIES TO DECIDE AS THEY PLEASED
BELLS WERE RUNG IN THE RARE STEEPLES OF THE CHURCHES
53 THE KANSAS MILITIA WAS A MYTH
THE QUESTION OF SUFFRAGE FOR ALIENS WAS A LIVING PROBLEM IN THE STATE AND MR LINCOLN NATURALLY TOOK LIBERAL GROUND ON IT
IN ALL THE INTERVALS OF HIS WORK--IN WHICH HE NEVER TOOK DELIGHT KNOWING WELL ENOUGH THAT HE WAS BORN FOR SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT--HE READ WROTE AND CIPHERED INCESSANTLY
THIS CERTIFICATE OR MARRIAGE LIST HERE SHOWN IN REDUCED FAC-SIMILE WRITTEN BY THE REV
THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WHEN CONGRESS CAME TOGETHER IN DECEMBER 1844 WAS PROPITIOUS TO THE PROJECT
HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO WASTE PAPER UPON HIS ORIGINAL COMPOSITIONS
TO HIS HONOR BE IT SAID THAT HE NEVER TOOK FROM A CLIENT EVEN WHEN HIS CAUSE WAS GAINED MORE THAN HE THOUGHT THE SERVICES WERE WORTH AND THE CLIENT COULD REASONABLY AFFORD TO PAY
I SEND YOU A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN FROM A PORTRAIT OF MY FATHER PAINTED ABOUT THE YEAR 1821 BY KING OF WASHINGTON WHEN MY FATHER THE INVENTOR OF THE COTTON-GIN WAS FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD
THIS GAVE HIM THE NECESSARY NUMBER OF FIFTY-ONE AND ELECTED HIM A SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES
SO IT WAS NOT WITH THE TREMOR OF A COMPLETE NOVICE THAT THE YOUNG MAN TOOK THE STUMP DURING THE FEW DAYS LEFT HIM BETWEEN HIS RETURN AND THE ELECTION
NOT EVEN THE TRAMMELS OF RANK WHICH ARE USUALLY SO STRONG AMONG THE TRAILERS OF THE SABER COULD RESTRAIN HIM FROM WHAT HE CONSIDERED HIS SIMPLE DUTY
FEW MEN EVER LIVED MORE SENSITIVELY AND DELICATELY TENDER TOWARDS THE SEX
AND IT DISPLAYS HIS RARE SELF-CONFIDENCE AND CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIGH ABILITY TO VENTURE TO ATTACK SUCH AN ANTAGONIST
BUT RUNNING THROUGH THIS LIKE A THREAD OF GOLD WAS THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE ESSENTIAL INJUSTICE AND IMMORALITY OF THE SYSTEM
FROM DAYS OF GLOOM AND DEPRESSION SUCH AS WE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING NO DOUBT CAME PRECIOUS RESULTS IN THE WAY OF SYMPATHY SELF-RESTRAINT AND THAT SOBER RELIANCE ON THE FINAL TRIUMPH OF GOOD OVER EVIL PECULIAR TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN GREATLY TRIED BUT NOT DESTROYED
THE TWO FRIENDS ALTHOUGH SO WIDELY DIFFERENT WERE HELPFUL TO EACH OTHER AFTERWARDS IN MANY WAYS AND LINCOLN MADE AMPLE AMENDS FOR THE LIBERTY HIS HANDS HAD TAKEN WITH JACK'S THROAT BY SAVING IN A MEMORABLE TRIAL HIS SON'S NECK FROM THE HALTER
HIS PUBLISHED SPEECHES SHOW HOW MUCH THE POET IN HIM WAS CONSTANTLY KEPT IN CHECK
MARRIAGE CHAPTER XII
THE TERMS HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CODE AS THEN UNDERSTOOD IN THE WEST TO LINCOLN AND HE CERTAINLY MADE NO GRUDGING USE OF HIS PRIVILEGE
HE HAD READ EVERY BOOK HE COULD FIND AND COULD SPELL DOWN THE WHOLE COUNTY AT THEIR ORTHOGRAPHICAL CONTESTS
THE BRANSON RESCUE

THE PLACE CAME INDEED TO ILLINOIS BUT TO NEITHER OF THE THREE WE HAVE MENTIONED

1780 THE PERIOD AT WHICH LINCOLN CAME WEST WAS ONE OF NOTE IN THE HISTORY OF KENTUCKY
THOUGH FROM THE LONG MARCH THERE CAME CONSTANT CRIES OF DANGER AND DISTRESS OF STARVATION AND INDIAN MASSACRE THERE WAS NEITHER HALTING NOR DELAY
IT WAS SETTLED EARLY IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE AND THE COUNTRY WAS HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM BY THE ABORIGINES
SHANNON DISPATCH DECEMBER 11 1855 TO PRESIDENT PIERCE
CHAPTER XVIII THE BALANCE OF POWER WE SHALL SEE IN THE COURSE OF THE PRESENT WORK HOW THE LIFE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN DIVIDES ITSELF INTO THREE PRINCIPAL PERIODS WITH CORRESPONDING STAGES OF INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT
BUT LET HIM BE THOROUGHLY ROUSED LET HIM FEEL THAT HE WAS RIGHT AND SOME PRINCIPLE WAS INVOLVED IN HIS CAUSE AND HE WOULD COME OUT WITH AN EARNESTNESS OF CONVICTION A POWER OF ARGUMENT A WEALTH OF ILLUSTRATION THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN SURPASSED
THOMAS LINCOLN WAS ALWAYS READY TO MOVE
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BORNE THE FORMER NAME DURING HER MOTHER'S LIFE-TIME AND TO HAVE TAKEN HER STEPMOTHER'S NAME AFTER MR LINCOLN'S SECOND MARRIAGE TO THE ONLY SCHOOLS THAT EXISTED IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD ONE KEPT BY ZACHARIAH RINEY ANOTHER BY CALEB HAZEL WHERE HE LEARNED HIS ALPHABET AND A LITTLE MORE
THEY CLASSED HIM AS A FREE-STATE MAN AN ABOLITIONIST AND IT BECAME ONLY TOO EVIDENT THAT HE WOULD GRADUALLY BE SHORN OF POWER AND DEGRADED FROM THE POSITION OF TERRITORIAL EXECUTIVE TO THAT OF A MERE PUPPET
THIS SORT OF FICTION IS THE COMMONEST KNOWN TO AMERICAN POLITICS
BUT NOW THE UNCONTROLLABLE STREAM OF EMIGRATION HAD BROKEN INTO AND THROUGH THIS RESERVATION CREATING IN A FEW YEARS WELL-DEFINED ROUTES OF TRAVEL TO NEW MEXICO UTAH CALIFORNIA AND OREGON
BUT THERE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THIS HIS LAST CANDIDACY WHICH EXCITED HIS FAITHFUL FOLLOWERS TO A PECULIAR INTENSITY OF DEVOTION
BUT TWO OR THREE INCIDENTS OF THIS SORT IN THREE-QUARTERS OF A CENTURY DO NOT TURN A PARSON INTO A PUGILIST
SHE COULD READ AND WRITE,--A REMARKABLE ACCOMPLISHMENT IN HER CIRCLE,--AND EVEN TAUGHT HER HUSBAND TO FORM THE LETTERS OF HIS NAME
HE WANTED TO TAKE A FLAT-BOAT AND CARGO TO NEW ORLEANS AND HAVING HEARD THAT HANKS AND LINCOLN HAD SOME EXPERIENCE OF THE RIVER HE INSISTED ON THEIR JOINING HIM
THE BLESSINGS OF AN ENFRANCHISED RACE WOULD FOREVER HAIL HIM AS THEIR LIBERATOR
NOTHING DAUNTED THEY MADE THEIR SPEECHES AND READ THEIR PLATFORM TO EACH OTHER
I HAVE GOT THE PREACHER AND I DON'T WANT YOUR VOTE THE ELECTION WAS HELD IN AUGUST AND THE WHIG CANDIDATE'S MAJORITY WAS VERY LARGE--1511 IN THE DISTRICT WHERE CLAY'S MAJORITY HAD BEEN ONLY 914 AND WHERE TAYLOR'S TWO YEARS LATER WITH ALL THE GLAMOUR OF VICTORY ABOUT HIM WAS TEN LESS

AGAINST PROTEST AND APPEAL UNDER LEGISLATIVE WHIP AND SPUR WITH THE TEMPTING SMILES AND PATRONAGE OF THE ADMINISTRATION AFTER NEARLY A FOUR MONTHS PARLIAMENTARY STRUGGLE THE PLIGHTED FAITH OF A GENERATION WAS VIOLATED AND THE REPEALING ACT PASSED--MAINLY BY THE GREAT INFLUENCE AND EXAMPLE OF DOUGLAS WHO HAD ONLY FIVE YEARS BEFORE SO FITTINGLY DESCRIBED THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE AS BEING AKIN TO THE CONSTITUTION AND CANONIZED IN THE HEARTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS A SACRED THING WHICH NO RUTHLESS HAND WOULD EVER BE RECKLESS ENOUGH TO DISTURB RELOCATED FOOTNOTE 1
AND ALTHOUGH WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT WE HAVE MADE MISTAKES THAT WE HAVE FALLEN INTO SUCH ERRORS AND INACCURACIES AS ARE UNAVOIDABLE IN SO LARGE A WORK WE CLAIM THERE IS NOT A LINE IN ALL THESE VOLUMES DICTATED BY MALICE OR UNFAIRNESS

193 RELOCATED FOOTNOTE 4
THE RUTHLESS REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE HAD EFFECTUALLY BROKEN THE LEGISLATIVE POWER OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
MY FATHER MENTON GRAHAM WAS ON THAT DAY AS USUAL APPOINTED TO BE A CLERK AND MR MCNAMEE WHO WAS TO BE THE OTHER WAS SICK AND FAILED TO COME
HE WAS SURE OF THE UNITED SUPPORT OF THE WHIGS AND SO MANY OF THE DEMOCRATS ALSO WANTED TO VOTE FOR HIM THAT SOME OF THE LEADING MEMBERS OF THAT PARTY CAME TO HIM AND PROPOSED THEY SHOULD GIVE HIM AN ORGANIZED SUPPORT
WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY OF EX-VICE-PRESIDENT HANNIBAL HAMLIN FOR STATING THAT MR DOUGLAS WHO WAS ON SPECIALLY INTIMATE TERMS WITH HIM TOLD HIM THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE FINAL AMENDMENT TO THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA BILL REPEALING THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE WAS WRITTEN BY PRESIDENT FRANKLIN PIERCE

WHAT DIVISIONS OR SCHISMS WOULD IT CARRY INTO THE RANKS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ESPECIALLY IN THE PENDING CONTEST BETWEEN THE HARDS AND SOFTS IN NEW YORK
YET THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO SUPERFLUITY OF LAW OR OF LEARNING JUSTICE WAS SUBSTANTIALLY ADMINISTERED
IT IS A PARTY MEASURE FOR PARTY PURPOSES FROM WHICH NO PRACTICAL GOOD TO THE PEOPLE CAN POSSIBLY ARISE BUT WHICH MAY BE THE SOURCE OF IMMEASURABLE EVILS
IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE DIALECT OF THE COUNTRY DATED FROM THE LOST TOWNSHIPS AND SIGNED REBECCA AND PURPORTED TO COME FROM A FARMER WIDOW OF THE COUNTY WHO EXPRESSED IN THIS FASHION HER DISCONTENT WITH THE EVIL COURSE OF AFFAIRS
THE CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE SPOKE ABOUT LITTLE ELSE AND THE ONLY POINT OF EMULATION AMONG THE PARTIES WAS WHICH SHOULD BE THE MORE RECKLESS AND GRANDIOSE IN ITS PROMISES
MANY AND MOST OF THE JUDGES HAVE HAD GREAT PERSONAL POPULARITY--SO MUCH SO AS TO CREATE COMPLAINT OF SO MANY OF THEM BEING ELECTED OR APPOINTED TO OTHER OFFICES
A VOTE AGAINST A MAN HAD SOMETHING OF OFFENSE IN IT AND SOMETIMES STIRRED UP A DEFEATED CANDIDATE TO HEROIC VENGEANCE
IN NO SENSE A RADICAL SUBVERSIVE OR ABOLITION PRODUCTION THE TOPEKA CONSTITUTION WAS REMARKABLE ONLY AS BEING THE INDIGNANT PROTEST OF THE PEOPLE OF THE TERRITORY AGAINST THE MISSOURI USURPATION
WE GIVE A COPY OF THESE LINES NOT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR INTRINSIC MERIT BUT AS ILLUSTRATING THE VERSATILITY OF THE LAWYER ORATOR AND SOLDIER WHO WROTE THEM

A POETICAL FANCY WOULD IN HIM HAVE BEEN AN INDICATION OF INSANITY
THEIR GAMBOLS NEVER CAUSED HIM TO LOSE HIS SELF-POSSESSION
THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO LISTEN TO COUNSELS OF CAUTION AND MODERATION
THE ALARM OF THE NATION ON THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE WAS SERIOUS AND STARTLING
FROM PEORIA TO WARSAW;--IN ALL 1350 MILES OF RAILWAY
HE SAID

ALABAMA WAS ALREADY AUTHORIZED TO BE ADMITTED WITH SLAVERY AND THIS WOULD MAKE THE NUMBER OF FREE AND SLAVE STATES EQUAL GIVING ELEVEN STATES TO THE NORTH AND ELEVEN TO THE SOUTH
184 THESE DEMANDS WERE PRESSED UPON A NOT RELUCTANT LEGISLATURE
THERE THEY FOUND TWO BATTALIONS OF FRESH HORSEMEN UNDER MAJORS STILLMAN AND BAILEY WHO HAD AS YET SEEN NO SERVICE AND WERE EAGER FOR THE FRAY
A WITTY IRISH SOLDIER WHO WAS ALWAYS BOASTING OF HIS BRAVERY WHEN NO DANGER WAS NEAR BUT WHO INVARIABLY RETREATED WITHOUT ORDERS AT THE FIRST CHARGE OF THE ENGAGEMENT BEING ASKED BY HIS CAPTAIN WHY HE DID SO REPLIED CAPTAIN I HAVE AS BRAVE A HEART AS JULIUS CAESAR EVER HAD BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER WHENEVER DANGER APPROACHES MY COWARDLY LEGS WILL RUN AWAY WITH IT SO WITH MR LAMBORN'S PARTY--THEY TAKE THE PUBLIC MONEY INTO THEIR HANDS FOR THE MOST LAUDABLE PURPOSE THAT WISE HEADS AND HONEST HEARTS CAN DICTATE
SECOND THAT THESE HAD BEEN FINALLY SETTLED BY THE COMPROMISE MEASURES OF 1850
IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE LONGER TO LIVE AND CAN KEEP OUT OF AN IDLE HABIT BEFORE THEY ARE IN IT EASIER THAN THEY CAN GET OUT AFTER THEY ARE IN
IN MANY INSTANCES THIS MIASMATIC POISON DID NOT DESTROY THE STRENGTH OR MATERIALLY SHORTEN THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO ABSORBED IT IN THEIR YOUTH

HE HAD NOT ONLY PROVED HIMSELF THEIR MOST GALLANT CHIEF BUT AS A FINAL CROWN OF MERIT HE LED HIS STILL POWERFUL CONTINGENT OF FOLLOWERS TO A PATRIOTIC DEFENSE OF THE CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNMENT WHICH SOME OF HIS COMPEERS PUT INTO SUCH MORTAL JEOPARDY
BUT THERE COULD BE SEEN IN SUCH CASES THE INWARD STRUGGLE OF HIS OWN MIND
BUT HE HAD WHAT VERY FEW OF THEM POSSESSED ANY GLIMMERING NOTION OF A FIXED AND INFLEXIBLE WILL TO SUCCEED
EVEN BOONE TO WHOSE COURAGE FOREST LORE AND SINGULAR INTUITIONS OF SAVAGE CHARACTER THE STATE OF KENTUCKY OWED MORE THAN TO ANY OTHER MAN WAS DEPRIVED IN HIS OLD AGE OF HIS HARD EARNED HOMESTEAD THROUGH HIS IGNORANCE OF LEGAL FORMS AND REMOVED TO MISSOURI TO REPEAT IN THAT NEW TERRITORY HIS LABORS AND HIS MISFORTUNES

HE NEVER TALKED OF THESE DAYS TO HIS MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS

BUT THIS WAS THE EXCEPTION AND GENERALLY HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CITADEL OF THE CAUSE OR QUESTION AND STRUCK HOME THERE KNOWING IF THAT WERE WON THE OUTWORKS WOULD NECESSARILY FALL
AMONG THE BILLS PASSED AT THIS SESSION WAS AN APPORTIONMENT ACT BY WHICH SANGAMON COUNTY BECAME ENTITLED TO SEVEN REPRESENTATIVES AND TWO SENATORS AND EARLY IN THE SPRING EIGHT WHITE STATESMEN OF THE COUNTY WERE READY FOR THE FIELD--THE NINTH MR HERNDON HOLDING OVER AS STATE SENATOR
I DID NOT EXPECT TO CONQUER THE WHITE PEOPLE
THESE EVENTS TOOK PLACE IN THE AUTUMN OF 1837 BUT THEY INDICATE SUFFICIENTLY THE TEMPER OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE IN THE EARLIER PART OF THE YEAR
LOCAL POLITICS BECAME ACTIVE AND LINCOLN WAS SENT FOR FROM ALL DIRECTIONS TO ADDRESS THE PEOPLE
UNDER THE ORGANIC ACT THE GOVERNOR HAD AUTHORITY TO APPOINT THE FIRST MEETING AND IT SOON BECAME KNOWN THAT HIS MIND WAS FIXED UPON THE EMBRYO TOWN OF PAWNEE ADJOINING THE MILITARY POST OF FORT RILEY SITUATED ON THE KANSAS RIVER 110 MILES FROM THE MISSOURI LINE
SOME OF HIS JESTS ARE STILL REPEATED BY OLD LAWYERS IN ILLINOIS AND SHOW AT LEAST A WELL-MARKED HUMOROUS INTENTION

THEY TOO WERE PRESENT AT THE STATE FAIR AND HEARD LINCOLN REPLY TO DOUGLAS
HE CLOSED UP HIS AFFAIRS IN SPRINGFIELD AND WENT WITH LINCOLN TO KENTUCKY AND INTRODUCING HIM TO HIS OWN CORDIAL AND HOSPITABLE FAMILY CIRCLE STROVE TO SOOTHE HIS PERTURBED SPIRIT BY EVERY MEANS WHICH UNAFFECTED FRIENDLINESS COULD SUGGEST
1117 MR DOUGLAS CLOSED THE DEBATE ADVOCATING THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL FOR GENERAL REASONS AND BY HIS SILENCE ACCEPTING ATCHISON'S CONCLUSIONS
THE STORY OF THE SUDDEN FORTUNES MADE THERE EXCITED AT FIRST WONDER AND AMAZEMENT
363 AT THE BEARDSTOWN RENDEZVOUS CAPTAIN LINCOLN'S COMPANY WAS ATTACHED TO COLONEL SAMUEL THOMPSON'S REGIMENT THE FOURTH ILLINOIS WHICH WAS ORGANIZED AT RICHLAND SANGAMON COUNTY ON THE 21ST OF APRIL AND MOVED ON THE 27TH WITH THE REST OF THE COMMAND UNDER GENERAL SAMUEL WHITESIDES FOR YELLOW BANKS WHERE THE BOATS WITH PROVISIONS HAD BEEN ORDERED TO MEET THEM
TEXAS WAS AS SURE TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE UNION AS ARE TWO DROPS OF WATER TOUCHING EACH OTHER TO BECOME ONE
WITH THIS PROCLAMATION AS A SORT OF OFFICIAL FULCRUM CHIEF-JUSTICE LECOMPTE DELIVERED AT THE MAY TERM OF HIS COURT A MOST EXTRAORDINARY CHARGE TO THE GRAND JURY
BUT BY THIS TIME THE WHIG PARTY OF THE CENTRAL COUNTIES THOUGH SHAKEN BY THE DISTURBING FEATURES OF THE NEBRASKA QUESTION HAD NEVERTHELESS REFORMED ITS LINES AND ASSUMED THE OFFENSIVE TO WHICH ITS PREPONDERANT NUMBERS ENTITLED IT AND RESOLVED NOT TO SURRENDER EITHER ITS NAME OR ORGANIZATION
NEVERTHELESS FISTS TEETH AND THE GOUGING THUMB WERE OFTEN EMPLOYED WITH FATAL EFFECT
A GREAT MANY OF THE GROCERY SORT OF VAN BUREN MEN ARE OUT FOR HARRISON
THE INDIANS RETREATED BUT WERE SOON OVERTAKEN AND TWO OR THREE OF THEM KILLED
HE HAD NO PATIENCE WITH THE REFINEMENTS AND RETICENCES OF MODERN THEOLOGY AND IN HIS LATER YEARS OBSERVED WITH SCORN AND SORROW THE PROGRESS OF EDUCATION AND SCHOLARLY TRAINING IN HIS OWN COMMUNION
HE LEFT TO OTHERS HOWEVER THE ACTIVE WORK ON THE FLOOR
SO TO CALL SUCH AN ACT TO US APPEARS NO OTHER THAN A NAKED IMPUDENT ABSURDITY AND WE SPEAK OF IT ACCORDINGLY
THE LATE GIDEON WELLES SECRETARY OF THE NAVY WHO GAVE MUCH INTELLIGENT EFFORT TO GENEALOGICAL RESEARCHES WAS CONVINCED THAT THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHO MARRIED MISS HANNAH WINTERS A DAUGHTER OF ANN BOONE SISTER OF THE FAMOUS DANIEL WAS THE PRESIDENT'S GRANDFATHER

WITH YOUTH GOOD HEALTH AND A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND EVEN THEN THE DAWN OF A YOUNG AND UNDEFILED AMBITION IN HIS HEART NOTHING WAS WANTING TO GIVE ZEST AND SPICE TO THIS LONG SOCIABLE WALK OF A HUNDRED LEAGUES
WINTHROP WAS CHOSEN SPEAKER THE NEXT DAY BY A MAJORITY OF ONE VOTE
ONCE LAUNCHED UPON THIS THEME MEN WERE SURPRISED TO FIND HIM IMBUED WITH AN UNWONTED SERIOUSNESS
BUT THE CONTRARY EFFECT RESULTED AND IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT A GRAVE ERROR OF JUDGMENT HAD BEEN COMMITTED IN WRITING THE LETTER
WHILE THROUGH 121 BALLOTINGS CONTINUING FROM DECEMBER 3 TO JANUARY 23 THE OPPOSITION REMAINED DIVIDED MR BANKS THE ANTI NEBRASKA FAVORITE RUNNING AT ONE TIME UP TO 106--WITHIN SEVEN VOTES OF AN ELECTION

285 THE ONE POINT AT WHICH THEY INSTINCTIVELY CLUNG TO CIVILIZATION WAS THEIR REGARD FOR LAW AND REVERENCE FOR COURTS OF JUSTICE
GROUPED ABOUT THESE TWO POINTS WERE HALF A DOZEN HEAVY SLAVEHOLDING COUNTIES OF MISSOURI,--PLATTE CLAY BAY JACKSON LAFAYETTE SALINE AND OTHERS
AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE GIVEN TIME SENATOR DOUGLAS SIGNIFIED HIS INTENTION TO INTRODUCE SUCH A BILL AS HAD BEEN SPOKEN OF FOOTNOTE

THERE WAS A BRISK TRADE IN REAL ESTATE AND THERE WAS EVEN A BEGINNING IN CHICAGO OF THAT PASSION FOR SPECULATION IN TOWN LOTS WHICH AFTERWARDS BECAME A FRENZY
MARCY 98
IT IS AN ADMIRABLE DISCOURSE AND THE OBLIVION WHICH OVERTOOK IT ALONG WITH THE VOLUMES OF OTHER SPEECHES MADE AT THE SAME TIME CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY REMEMBERING THAT THE GUADALUPE TREATY CAME SUDDENLY IN UPON THE DEBATE WITH ITS IMMENSE CONSEQUENCES SWEEPING FOREVER OUT OF VIEW ALL CONSIDERATION OF THE CAUSES AND THE PROCESSES WHICH LED TO THE MOMENTOUS RESULT
THAT HE HAD LIFTED HIMSELF BY HEALTHY AMBITION AND UNAIDED INDUSTRY OUT OF THE STATION OF A FARM-HAND WHOSE ROUTINE LIFE BEGINS AND ENDS IN A BACKWOODS LOG-CABIN TO THAT REPRESENTATIVE CHARACTER AND AUTHORITY WHICH SEATED HIM IN THE NATIONAL CAPITOL TO AID IN FRAMING LAWS FOR HIS COUNTRY WAS ALREADY AN ACHIEVEMENT THAT MAY WELL BE HELD TO CROWN HONORABLY A CAREER OF FORTY YEARS
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES HAS THE POWER UNDER THE CONSTITUTION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BUT THAT THE POWER OUGHT NOT TO BE EXERCISED UNLESS AT THE REQUEST OF THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT
AND THE OTHER WHIG PAPERS OF THE DISTRICT ARE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY
WE ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH THEIR EFFECT UPON A CHARACTER WHICH WAS TO BE HEREAFTER FOR ALL TIME ONE OF THE POSSESSIONS OF THE NATION
THE ARCHIVES OF THE STATE WERE NOT REMOVED TO SPRINGFIELD UNTIL 1839 AND LINCOLN REMAINED A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE BY SUCCESSIVE REELECTIONS FROM 1834 TO 1842
SOME DAYS AFTERWARDS JUDGE DOUGLAS CAME TO MY LODGINGS WHILST I WAS CONFINED BY PHYSICAL INDISPOSITION AND URGED ME TO GET UP AND TAKE A RIDE WITH HIM IN HIS CARRIAGE

HE HAD GROWN UP ON THE FRONTIER THE UTMOST FRINGE OF CIVILIZATION YET HE WAS GENTLE AND CLEAN OF SPEECH INNOCENT OF BLASPHEMY OR SCANDAL
JOSHUA SPEED TOLD THE WRITERS THAT ON ONE OCCASION SOME OF THE WHIGS CONTRIBUTED A PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH SPEED HANDED TO LINCOLN TO PAY HIS PERSONAL EXPENSES IN THE CANVASS
NO OTHER NAME WAS MENTIONED
THAT WE HAD ACQUIRED IN SHORT SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF DESERT MOUNTAIN AND WILDERNESS
HE WOULD OFTEN PERSUADE A FAIR MINDED LITIGANT OF THE INJUSTICE OF HIS CASE AND INDUCE HIM TO GIVE IT UP
I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO TRY YOUR HAND AT MAKING SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IN SOME OTHER WAY SOMETIMES AFTER HE HAD ENTERED UPON A CRIMINAL CASE THE CONVICTION THAT HIS CLIENT WAS GUILTY WOULD AFFECT HIM WITH A SORT OF PANIC
FOR DESPITE THEIR PRETENSIONS TO CHIVALRY THEY HAD NO SCRUPLES ABOUT FAIR PLAY OR ANY SUCH SUPERSTITIONS OF CIVILIZATION
IN REGARD TO ALL QUESTIONS BEARING UPON SLAVERY HE OBSERVED A DISCRETION IN THE CANVASS WHICH WAS ALMOST LUDICROUS
IT WAS THIS POVERTY OF LIFE THIS FAMINE OF SOCIAL GRATIFICATION FROM WHICH SPRANG THEIR FONDNESS FOR THE GROSSER FORMS OF EXCITEMENT AND THEIR TENDENCY TO ROUGH AND BRUTAL PRACTICAL JOKING
HIS POPULARITY INCREASED FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN AND THOSE OF HIS COMRADES WHO STILL SURVIVE ALWAYS SPEAK WITH HEARTY AND AFFECTIONATE PRAISE OF HIS CHARACTER AND CONDUCT IN THOSE ROUGH YET PLEASANTLY REMEMBERED DAYS
THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED OF THESE WERE NOMINAL RESIDENTS OF THE TERRITORY
THEY MUST FELL TREES FOR FENCE-RAILS BEFORE NOON AND IN THE WAXING OF THE MOON
HE WAS EVIDENTLY OF BETTER AND FINER CLAY THAN HIS FELLOWS EVEN IN THOSE WILD AND IGNORANT DAYS
RICHARDSON OF ILLINOIS WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE TERRITORIAL COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE HE COULD THEREFORE CHOOSE HIS OWN TIME AND MODE OF INTRODUCING MEASURES OF THIS CHARACTER IN EITHER HOUSE OF CONGRESS UNDER THE MAJORITY CONTROL OF HIS PARTY--A FACT TO BE CONSTANTLY BORNE IN MIND WHEN WE CONSIDER THE ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF THE THREE NEBRASKA BILLS SIDENOTE
IN VIEW OF THE COMING PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IT WAS THE FASHION IN THE STATES FOR DEMOCRATS TO STYLE THEMSELVES NATIONAL DEMOCRATS
HIS MIND WAS SLOW IN ACQUISITION AND HIS POWERS OF REASONING AND RHETORIC IMPROVED CONSTANTLY TO THE END OF HIS LIFE AT A RATE OF PROGRESS MARVELOUSLY REGULAR AND SUSTAINED
BUT THE STORY OF HIS LIFE WOULD NOT HAVE COMMANDED AS IT NOW DOES THE UNFLAGGING ATTENTION OF THE WORLD HAD THERE NOT FALLEN UPON HIS GENERATION THE UNUSUAL CONDITIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES BROUGHT ABOUT BY A SERIES OF REMARKABLE CONVULSIONS IN NATIONAL POLITICS
THE ACTUAL FACTS HAD LITTLE TO DO WITH THE PREDETERMINATION OF THE MEMBERS

FINALLY THE USUAL SKELETON ORGANIZATION OF A TERRITORIAL MILITIA WAS DEVISED WHOSE GENERAL OFFICERS WERE IN DUE TIME APPOINTED BY THE ACTING GOVERNOR FROM PROMINENT AND SERVICEABLE PRO-SLAVERY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE
IT IS NOT UNWORTHY OF NOTICE THAT IN A COUNTRY WHERE MILITARY TITLES WERE CONFERRED WITH LUDICROUS PROFUSION AND BORNE WITH ABSURD COMPLACENCY ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHO HAD ACTUALLY BEEN COMMISSIONED AND HAD SERVED AS CAPTAIN NEVER USED THE DESIGNATION AFTER HE LAID DOWN HIS COMMAND LINCOLN DID NOT GAIN ANY IMMEDIATE EMINENCE AT THE BAR

208 THESE WERE THE FAMOUS COMPROMISE MEASURES OF 1850
THE FIRST ATTEMPT MADE BY HIS FRIENDS TO INDORSE THE CONDUCT OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS MET BY A STERN REBUKE FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WHICH PASSED AN AMENDMENT PROPOSED BY GEORGE ASHMUN THAT THE WAR HAD BEEN UNNECESSARILY AND UNCONSTITUTIONALLY COMMENCED BY THE PRESIDENT THIS SEVERE DECLARATION WAS PROVOKED AND JUSTIFIED BY THE PERSISTENT AND DISINGENUOUS ASSERTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT THAT THE PRECEDING CONGRESS HAD WITH VIRTUAL UNANIMITY DECLARED THAT WAR EXISTED BY THE ACT OF MEXICO"--THE TRUTH BEING THAT A STRONG MINORITY HAD VOTED TO STRIKE OUT THOSE WORDS FROM THE PREAMBLE OF THE SUPPLY BILL BUT BEING OUTVOTED IN THIS THEY WERE COMPELLED EITHER TO VOTE FOR PREAMBLE AND BILL TOGETHER OR ELSE REFUSE SUPPLIES TO THE ARMY
IT WAS NOT AN IMPOSING ANIMAL TO JUDGE FROM THE DESCRIPTION
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS HE ACCOMPANIED HIS CLOSE FRIEND AND CONFIDANT JOSHUA F
LET FATHER AND YOUR BOYS TAKE CHARGE OF THINGS AT HOME PREPARE FOR A CROP AND MAKE THE CROP
THEY ESTABLISHED THREE NEWSPAPERS AND SUSTAINED THEM WITH MONEY AND CONTRIBUTIONS
NO WORD OF THE AUTHORS COULD ADD TO THE FORCE AND ELOQUENCE OF THE FOLLOWING FROM A RECENT LETTER OF THE SON OF THE INVENTOR OF THE COTTON-GIN TO THE ART SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CENTURY STATING THE CLAIMS OF HIS FATHER'S MEMORY TO THE GRATITUDE OF THE SOUTH HITHERTO APPARENTLY UNFELT AND CERTAINLY UNRECOGNIZED
NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAD NO AUTHORITY TO ORDER A PART OF THE DISPUTED TERRITORY IN POSSESSION OF THE MEXICANS TO BE OCCUPIED BY OUR TROOPS
THE QUESTION HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO A POPULAR VOTE IN 1834 AND THE RESULT SHOWED ABOUT AS MANY CITIES DESIROUS OF OPENING THEIR GATES TO THE LEGISLATURE AS CLAIMED THE HONOR OF BEING THE BIRTHPLACE OF HOMER
GEESE AND CHICKENS WERE CAUGHT BY THE FEET AND WINGS AND FROZEN TO THE WET GROUND
THEY WERE CALLED WITH HERNDON THE LONG NINE THEIR AVERAGE HEIGHT WAS OVER SIX FEET AND THEIR AGGREGATE ALTITUDE WAS SAID TO BE FIFTY-FIVE FEET
HIS CAMPAIGNS WERE CARRIED ON ALMOST ENTIRELY WITHOUT EXPENSE
THE BELIEF IN WITCHCRAFT HAD LONG AGO PASSED AWAY WITH THE SMOKE OF THE FAGOTS FROM OLD AND NEW ENGLAND BUT IT SURVIVED FAR INTO THIS CENTURY IN KENTUCKY AND THE LOWER HALVES OF INDIANA AND ILLINOIS--TOUCHED WITH A PECULIAR TINGE OF AFRICAN MAGIC
THE AMERICAN PARTY
ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT OTTAWA THEY BECAME CLAMOROUS FOR THEIR DISCHARGE WHICH THE GOVERNOR GRANTED RETAINING--OF THOSE WHO WERE DISCHARGED AND VOLUNTEERED FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF TWENTY DAYS--A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF MEN TO FORM SIX COMPANIES WHICH GENERAL ATKINSON FOUND AT OTTAWA ON HIS ARRIVAL THERE FROM ROCK RIVER
HE WAS ALSO A MAGNANIMOUS BOY WITH A LARGER AND KINDLIER SPIRIT THAN COMMON
THESE THEY EASILY FOUND IN THE RICH HARVEST OF LOCAL MONOPOLIES AND FRANCHISES WHICH LAY SCATTERED IN PROFUSION ON THIS VIRGIN FIELD OF LEGISLATION READY TO BE SEIZED AND APPROPRIATED WITHOUT DISPUTE BY THE FIRST OCCUPANTS
81 IN A COMMUNITY WHERE THE PRINCIPAL MEN WERE LAWYERS WHERE THERE WAS AS YET LITTLE COMMERCE AND INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE WAS UNKNOWN IT WAS NATURAL THAT ONE OF THE CHIEF INTERESTS OF LIFE SHOULD BE THE PURSUIT OF POLITICS
FIFTEEN YEARS AFTERWARDS IN THE STRESS AND TEMPEST OF A TERRIBLE WAR IT WAS MR LINCOLN'S STRANGE FORTUNE TO SIGN A BILL SENT HIM BY CONGRESS FOR THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN WASHINGTON
THE SETTLERS OF THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY WERE COMPARATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER
SPEED IN THE EASE AND HAPPINESS OF HIS HOME THANKS LINCOLN FOR HIS IMPORTANT PART IN HIS WELFARE AND GIVES HIM SAGE COUNSEL FOR HIMSELF
I WOULD REJOICE TO BE SPARED THE LABOR OF A CONTEST BUT BEING IN I SHALL GO IT THOROUGHLY HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE DISTRICT WAS CURIOUSLY MINUTE THOUGH HE UNDERESTIMATED HIS OWN POPULARITY
ANOTHER SERIOUS OBJECTION WAS THAT THE RESOLUTIONS WERE TAKEN AS COMMITTING THE UNITED STATES TO THE ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE RIO GRANDE DEL NORTE AS THE WESTERN BOUNDARY OF TEXAS
IN JUNE 1845 MR DONELSON IN CHARGE OF THE AMERICAN LEGATION IN MEXICO ASSURED THE SECRETARY OF STATE THAT WAR WAS INEVITABLE THOUGH HE ADOPTED THE FICTION OF MR CALHOUN THAT IT WAS THE RESULT OF THE ABOLITIONIST INTRIGUES OF GREAT BRITAIN WHICH HE CREDITED WITH THE INTENTION OF DEPRIVING BOTH TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES OF ALL CLAIM TO THE COUNTRY BETWEEN THE NUECES AND THE RIO GRANDE NO ONE THEREFORE DOUBTED THAT WAR WOULD FOLLOW AND IT SOON CAME
A BILL WAS AT ONCE REPORTED IN THAT SENSE APPROPRIATING $30,000 FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE NEGOTIATION AND $2,000,000 TO BE USED IN THE PRESIDENT'S DISCRETION
BUT WE THINK THAT FEW MEN HAVE EVER LIVED WHO WERE MORE FREE FROM THOSE DEGRADING PASSIONS THAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THE PERSONAL REPROBATION WITH WHICH HE ALWAYS VISITED THE PUBLIC ACTS OF DOUGLAS AROSE FROM HIS SINCERE CONVICTION THAT ABLE AS DOUGLAS WAS AND IN MANY RESPECTS ADMIRABLE IN CHARACTER HE WAS ESSENTIALLY WITHOUT FIXED POLITICAL MORALS
180 THE WHOLE OF THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORY HAD IT IS TRUE BEEN DEDICATED TO FREEDOM BY THE ORDINANCE OF 1787 BUT IN SPITE OF THAT FAMOUS PROHIBITION SLAVERY EXISTED IN A MODIFIED FORM THROUGHOUT THAT VAST TERRITORY WHEREVER THERE WAS ANY CONSIDERABLE POPULATION
THE NEXT YEAR THE TIME OF HOLDING ELECTIONS WAS CHANGED AND ALWAYS AFTERWARDS THE CANDIDATES WERE ELECTED THE YEAR BEFORE VACANCIES WERE TO OCCUR

WHEN I CAME INTO CHARLESTON DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY I LEARNED THAT YOU WERE ANXIOUS TO SELL THE LAND WHERE YOU LIVE AND MOVE TO MISSOURI
THE GOVERNOR RETORTED IN A LETTER THAT THE MEETING WAS COMPOSED OF MISSOURIANS AND THAT HE SHOULD RESIST OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE FROM FRIEND FOE OR FACTION
ONLY THE ABOLITIONISTS EVER AGGRESSIVE ON ALL SLAVERY ISSUES WERE READY TO LEAD OFF IN NEW COMBINATIONS BUT NOBODY WAS WILLING TO ENCOUNTER THE ODIUM OF ACTING WITH THEM

LINCOLN REENLISTS
SCHEMES OF RAILROAD BUILDING
SINCE THEN WE HAVE HAD THIRTY-SIX YEARS OF EXPERIENCE
WHILE THE SETTLERS FROM THE NORTH NOT BEING DEBARRED BY THE STATE CONSTITUTION FROM BRINGING THEIR PROPERTY WITH THEM WERE OF A DIFFERENT CLASS
HE NEVER APPROACHED HIS CAMP WITHOUT THE UTMOST PRECAUTION AND ALWAYS SLEPT IN THE CANE-BRAKES IF THE SIGNS WERE UNFAVORABLE
THE HEROIC DEFENSE OF THE ALAMO HAD BEEN MADE BY TRAVIS BOWIE AND DAVID CROCKETT WHOSE EXPLOITS AND DEATH FORM ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT PAGES OF OUR BORDER HISTORY
YOU DEFEND HIM I CAN'T AND SO GAVE UP HIS SHARE OF A LARGE FEE
HE DISMISSES THE SUBJECT IN A LINE BUT DILATES WITH A NEW PLANTER'S RAPTURE UPON THE BEAUTIES AND ATTRACTIONS OF HIS FARM
IN MANY RESPECTS HE WAS DOOMED TO A CERTAIN LONELINESS OF EXCELLENCE
THIS COMPANY GAVE PUBLICITY THROUGH NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS AND PAMPHLETS OF ITS WILLINGNESS TO ORGANIZE EMIGRANTS INTO COMPANIES TO SEND THEM TO KANSAS IN CHARGE OF TRUSTWORTHY AGENTS AND TO OBTAIN TRANSPORTATION FOR THEM AT REDUCED RATES
THE VOLUME YOU LEFT FOR ME HAS BEEN RECEIVED

THEY OCCASIONALLY BURST OUT INTO WILD FROLIC WHICH EASILY ASSUMED THE FORM OF COMIC OUTRAGE BUT OF THE SUSTAINED CHEERFULNESS OF SOCIAL CIVILIZED LIFE THEY KNEW VERY LITTLE
AND THE LAST OF ABOUT FIVE YEARS TERMINATING AT HIS DEATH
565 THE INCIDENT HOWEVER OF SPECIAL HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE HAD OCCURRED IN THE DEBATE OF THE 8TH WHEN A MEMBER ROSE AND SAID
ANDERSON WHO BEING WORSTED IN A VERBAL ENCOUNTER WITH LINCOLN AT LAWRENCEVILLE THE COUNTY-SEAT OF LAWRENCE COUNTY ILL WROTE HIM A NOTE DEMANDING AN EXPLANATION OF HIS WORDS AND OF HIS PRESENT FEELINGS LINCOLN'S REPLY SHOWS THAT HIS HABITUAL PEACEABLENESS INVOLVED NO LACK OF DIGNITY
ONE OF THESE FEW WAS STEPHEN T

LINCOLN HAD NO FURTHER OCCASION TO FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLES WHILE ARMSTRONG WAS THERE TO ACT AS HIS CHAMPION
AT SUNSET SUNDRY CITY BELLS WERE TOLLED FOR AN HOUR TO SIGNIFY THE PUBLIC MOURNING AT HIS DOWNFALL

THEY BELIEVE THAT THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY IS FOUNDED ON BOTH INJUSTICE AND BAD POLICY BUT THAT THE PROMULGATION OF ABOLITION DOCTRINES TENDS RATHER TO INCREASE THAN ABATE ITS EVILS
THESE WERE STEPHEN A
THE MEASURES INITIATED BY TYLER WERE OF COURSE CARRIED OUT BY POLK
IT WAS A WILD REGION WRITES MR LINCOLN IN ONE OF THOSE RARE BITS OF AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHICH HE LEFT BEHIND HIM WITH MANY BEARS AND OTHER WILD ANIMALS STILL IN THE WOODS
BUT HIS CHIEF CLAIM TO A PLACE IN HISTORY RESTS UPON THESE FEW LINES WHICH HE MOVED TO ADD TO THE FIRST SECTION OF THE BILL UNDER DISCUSSION
PRESIDENT PIERCE PROCLAIMS THE TOPEKA MOVEMENT REVOLUTIONARY
ALL IS KNOWN TO YOU HE RETURNED TO IOWA AND DIED ON THE 3D OF OCTOBER 1838 AT HIS CAMP ON THE RIVER DES MOINES
BLACK HAWK WHO HAD BEEN AT SUPPER WHEN THE RUNNING FIGHT BEGAN HASTILY GATHERED A HANDFUL OF WARRIORS AND ATTACKED THE SCATTERED WHITES
HE WAS ADMITTED TO BE THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE ARMY AND WITH ONE EXCEPTION THE BEST WRESTLER
THE GOVERNOR AND OTHER PRUDENT PARTISANS AVOIDED A PUBLIC COMMITTAL
NONSENSE
THE CHANGE IN POLITICAL METHODS WAS INEVITABLE AND IT IS IDLE TO DEPLORE IT
THEY WERE COMPLIMENTED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AT PUBLIC MEETINGS AND EVEN AT SUBSCRIPTION DINNERS
855 A COMMITTEE OF THEIR NUMBER PRESENTED A FORMAL WRITTEN DEMAND FOR THE SAME
WITH THIS OBJECT IN VIEW HE HAD A PRIVATE INTERVIEW WITH MR DOUGLAS AND INFORMED HIM OF WHAT HE DESIRED--THE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL FOR NEBRASKA LIKE WHAT SIC HE HAD PROMISED TO VOTE FOR AND THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO BE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON TERRITORIES IN ORDER TO INTRODUCE SUCH A MEASURE
A LETTER OF HIS WRITTEN TO A FRIEND IN KENTUCKY IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR SHOWS US THAT HE HAD NEARLY REACHED A MATURITY OF CONVICTION ON THE NATURE OF THE SLAVERY CONFLICT--HIS BELIEF THAT THE NATION COULD NOT PERMANENTLY ENDURE HALF SLAVE AND HALF FREE--WHICH HE DID NOT PUBLICLY EXPRESS UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF HIS FAMOUS SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN OF 1858
HITHERTO SAID THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE IN A LONG AND GRANDILOQUENT REPORT CONGRESS HAVE RETAINED TO THEMSELVES THE POWER TO MOLD AND SHAPE ALL THE TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN PECULIAR NOTIONS AND TO RESTRICT WITHIN VERY LIMITED AND CONTRACTED BOUNDS BOTH THE NATURAL AS WELL AS THE POLITICAL RIGHTS OF THE BOLD AND DARING PIONEER AND THE NOBLE HARD-FISTED SQUATTER BUT BY THIS COURSE THE ARGUMENT OF THE COMMITTEE CONTINUED THE PILLARS WHICH UPHOLD THIS GLORIOUS UNION OF STATES WERE SHAKEN UNTIL THE WHOLE WORLD WAS THREATENED WITH A POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE AND THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF SELF-GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOREVER SWALLOWED UP BY ANARCHY AND CONFUSION HAD NOT THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA BILL DELEGATED TO THE PEOPLE OF THESE TERRITORIES THE RIGHT TO FRAME AND ESTABLISH THEIR OWN FORM OF GOVERNMENT SIDENOTE
AND HE WHOSE WISDOM SURPASSES THAT OF ALL PHILOSOPHERS HAS DECLARED THAT A HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAND HE CALLS TO MIND THE VICTORY OF 1840 THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY GAINED BY THE WHIGS THAT YEAR THEIR ILL SUCCESS SINCE AND THE NECESSITY OF UNITY AND CONCORD THAT THE PARTY MAY MAKE ITS ENTIRE STRENGTH FELT
FROM QUINCY TO THE WABASH RIVER
NOR FROM THE RED WOUND POURED THEIR LIFE WHERE COWERING FOEMEN YIELD
THE FORCES OF THE LECOMPTON CAMP FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PLOT AND WILL FIGHT UNDER THE SAME BANNER SIDENOTE
THE PRETENDED DANGER WAS THE PERMANENT LOSS OF POLITICAL POWER BY THE SLAVE STATES OF THE UNION AS SHOWN IN THE ELECTION OF LINCOLN TO THE PRESIDENCY WHICH THEY AVERRED WOULD NECESSARILY THROW ALL THE FORCES OF THE NATIONAL LIFE AGAINST THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION AND CRUSH IT UNDER FORMS OF LAW
WHILE WORKING WITH OFFUTT HIS MIND WAS TURNED IN THE DIRECTION OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR
THE MUSTER-IN ROLL IS NOT ON FILE BUT THE RECORDS SHOW THAT THE COMPANY WAS MUSTERED OUT AT THE MOUTH OF FOX RIVER MAY 27 1832 BY NATHANIEL BUCKMASTER BRIGADE-MAJOR TO GENERAL SAMUEL WHITESIDES'S ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS
THIS WAS FROM W
THE WAKARUSA WAR
DOUGLAS THOUGHT LITTLE OF THE RAW YOUTH FROM THE SANGAMON TIMBER AND LINCOLN SAID THE DWARFISH VERMONTER WAS THE LEAST MAN HE HAD EVER SEEN TO ALL APPEARANCE VANDALIA WAS FULL OF BETTER MEN THAN EITHER OF THEM--CLEVER LAWYERS MEN OF WIT AND STANDING SOME OF THEM THE SONS OF PROVIDENT EARLY SETTLERS BUT MORE WHO HAD COME FROM OLDER STATES TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNES IN THESE FRESH FIELDS
CLAY DEFEATED CHAPTER XIV
EDWARDS WAS VERY MUCH HURT AT NOT BEING NOMINATED BUT HE HAS BECOME TOLERABLY WELL RECONCILED
LIKE ANOTHER POET HE LOOKED INTO HIS OWN HEART AND WROTE
IF NOW AND THEN A TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE SEEMED GAINED IN THE HOUSE IT WAS LOST IN THE SENATE AND NO PERMANENT PROGRESS WAS MADE
HIS RESIGNATION LEFT A VACANCY IN CONGRESS AND A CONTEST CHARACTERISTIC OF THE POLITICS OF THE TIME AT ONCE SPRANG UP OVER IT
TWO OR THREE SENTENCES ARE QUITE SUFFICIENT TO PRESENT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE LONG AND WORDY REPORT
AND DAY BY DAY THESE UNSEEN INCITEMENTS INCREASED AROUND HIM UNTIL THEY COULD NOT BE RESISTED EVEN IF DEATH STOOD IN THE WAY
NEW MEXICO
IT CONTRIBUTED GREATLY IN THE OPINION OF MANY TO DEFEAT VAN BUREN WHOM JACKSON HELD IN GREAT ESTEEM AND REGARD AND SERVED THE PURPOSES OF THE TYLER FACTION WHOM HE DETESTED
THE CHANCE FOR DOING SO APPEARS TO ME TWENTY-FIVE PER CENT BETTER THAN IT DID FOR YOU TO BEAT DOUGLAS
IT CANNOT BE TOLD HOW IT NOW THRILLS ME WITH JOY TO HEAR YOU SAY YOU ARE FAR HAPPIER THAN YOU EVER EXPECTED TO BE
BETTER GIVE YOUR PATH TO A DOG THAN BE BITTEN BY HIM IN CONTESTING FOR THE RIGHT
THE YEAR BEFORE THE MAYFLOWER BROUGHT THE PILGRIMS TO PLYMOUTH BOCK A DUTCH SHIP LANDED A CARGO OF AFRICAN SLAVES AT JAMESTOWN IN VIRGINIA
YOU ARE NOT A FRIEND OF SLAVERY IN THE ABSTRACT
EX-GOVERNOR REEDER'S RESOLUTIONS
BIRNEY RECEIVED 62,263 VOTES AND THE POPULAR MAJORITY OF POLK OVER CLAY WAS ONLY 38,792
THE REAL SETTLERS WERE DEMOCRATS IT WAS TRUE
I HAVE HEARD HIM SAY SO OFTEN THE SIGHT OF MEN IN CHAINS WAS INTOLERABLE TO HIM
OWEN LOVEJOY AT LAST UPON FULL DELIBERATION LINCOLN RESIGNED HIS SEAT RELYING UPON THE SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED MAJORITY IN SANGAMON COUNTY TO ELECT ANOTHER WHIG
YET IF JUSTIN BUTTERFIELD HAD NOT BEEN A MORE SUPPLE MORE ADROIT AND LESS SCRUPULOUS SUITOR FOR OFFICE THAN HIMSELF ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD HAVE SAT FOR FOUR INESTIMABLE YEARS AT A BUREAU-DESK IN THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT AND WHEN THE HOUR OF ACTION SOUNDED IN ILLINOIS WHO WOULD HAVE FILLED THE PLACE WHICH HE TOOK AS IF HE HAD BEEN BORN FOR IT
THE BROKEN REMNANT OF BLACK HAWK'S POWER THEN FLED FOR THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER THE WHOLE ARMY FOLLOWING IN CLOSE PURSUIT--GENERAL ATKINSON IN FRONT AND GENERAL HENRY BRINGING UP THE REAR
IN MANY QUALITIES OF INTELLECT HE WAS TRULY THE LITTLE GIANT WHICH POPULAR FANCY NICKNAMED HIM
HE SPENT HIS TIME IN GOSSIP AND DRANK UP HIS SHARE OF THE PROFITS AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT LINCOLN WAS FAR MORE INTERESTED IN POLITICS AND GENERAL READING THAN IN THE PETTY TRAFFIC OF HIS SHOP
POLITICAL SPEECHES AT THE STATE FAIR
SO LONG AS OUR OPPONENTS DO NOT AGITATE FOR REPEAL OR MODIFICATION WHY SHOULD WE AGITATE FOR ANY PURPOSE
AND IT HAD IN RECENT TIMES MADE MANY OF THESE WESTERN COUNTIES RICH
SOUTHERN OPINION BEING OFFENDED BY THE ABANDONMENT OF THE PROPERTY DOCTRINE AND NORTHERN SENTIMENT IRRITATED BY CERTAIN HARSH FEATURES OF THE FUGITIVE-SLAVE LAW
FLUSHED WITH BATTLE HE AND ALLEN GENTRY CARRIED THE WAR INTO THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY AND PURSUED THE RETREATING AFRICANS SOME DISTANCE IN THE DARKNESS
OUR PLANS WERE MADE WITH THOROUGH CONCERT
HE LAY IN WAIT AND SHOT A DRUNKARD PREACHER WHOM HE SUSPECTED OF FURNISHING INFORMATION TO THE UNION ARMY
HE WAS WHOLLY UNKNOWN THERE EXCEPT BY HIS FEW COMRADES IN ARMS
DOUGLAS MADE A SPEECH ON THE FIRST DAY TUESDAY OCTOBER 3
THOMAS JOHNSON
WE TRUST IT WILL NOT BE REGARDED AS PRESUMPTUOUS IF WE SAY A WORD IN RELATION TO THE FACILITIES WE HAVE ENJOYED AND THE METHODS WE HAVE USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THIS WORK
LINEAGE THE LINCOLNS IN AMERICA
235 SIDENOTE
HE WAS ALREADY A LAWYER OF SKILL AND REPUTATION
I THINK SAYS MR JOSEPH GILLESPIE WHO WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO PERFORMED THIS FEAT OF ACROBATIC POLITICS MR LINCOLN ALWAYS REGRETTED IT AS HE DEPRECATED EVERYTHING THAT SAVORED OF THE REVOLUTIONARY TWO YEARS LATER THE PERSECUTED BANKS HARRIED BY THE DEMAGOGUES AND SWINDLED BY THE STATE FELL WITH A GREAT RUIN AND THE FINANCIAL MISERY OF THE STATE WAS COMPLETE
I WILL MENTION SAID HE IN HIS OPENING REMARKS THAT IT IS UNDERSTOOD BY SOME GENTLEMEN THAT MR LINCOLN OF THIS CITY IS EXPECTED TO ANSWER ME
AND TO SECURE YOU A FAIR REWARD FOR YOUR LABOR I NOW PROMISE YOU THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU WILL BETWEEN THIS AND THE FIRST OF NEXT MAY GET FOR YOUR OWN LABOR EITHER IN MONEY OR AS DISCHARGING YOUR OWN INDEBTEDNESS I WILL THEN GIVE YOU ONE OTHER DOLLAR
HUGH ARMSTRONG FOR SERVICES AS AXEMAN 5 DAYS AT 75 CENTS $3.75
THOSE OF EXTREME PRO-SLAVERY VIEWS LIKE DIXON OF KENTUCKY,--WHO WHEN HE INTRODUCED HIS AMENDMENT DECLARED UPON THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY I KNOW NO WHIGGERY AND NO DEMOCRACY,"--WENT BOLDLY AND AT ONCE OVER INTO THE DEMOCRATIC CAMP WHILE THOSE WHO RETAINED THEIR TRADITIONAL PARTY NAME AND FLAG WERE SUNDERED FROM THEIR ANCIENT ALLIES IN THE NORTHERN STATES BY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF TAKING UP THE LATTER'S ANTISLAVERY WAR-CRY
THE HOUSE WAS SO CLOSELY DIVIDED THAT LINCOLN WRITING ON THE 5TH EXPRESSED SOME DOUBT WHETHER THE WHIGS COULD ELECT ALL THEIR CAUCUS NOMINEES AND MR ROBERT C
THE ORDINARY CONGRESSMAN CAN NEVER CONCLUDE INSIDE THE LIMITS ASSIGNED HIM
ONE OF THESE PROBLEMS WAS THE PRESENCE OF OVER HALF A MILLION OF SLAVES NEARLY ALL IN FIVE SOUTHERN STATES
A MURDER WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS ADVANTAGES AS A STIMULUS TO CONVERSATION
THERE WAS NO DREAM THEN OF THAT PORTENTOUS DISCOVERY WHICH EVEN WHILE THE SENATE WAS WRANGLING OVER THE TREATY HAD CONVERTED CAPTAIN SUTTER'S MILL AT COLOMA INTO A MINING CAMP FOR HIS RUIN AND THE SUDDEN UP BUILDING OF MANY COLOSSAL FORTUNES
I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THOUGH JUDGE DAVIS WHO CAME DOWN THIS MORNING DECLARES HE NEVER WOULD HAVE CONSENTED TO THE 47 OPPOSITION MEN BEING CONTROLLED BY THE FIVE
THE YOUNG MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BORN SINCE SUMTER WAS FIRED ON HAVE A RIGHT TO ALL THEIR ELDERS KNOW OF THE IMPORTANT EVENTS THEY CAME TOO LATE TO SHARE IN
IN MY ABSENCE FROM TOWN ANY PERSONS WISHING THEIR LAND SURVEYED WILL DO WELL TO CALL AT THE RECORDER'S OFFICE AND ENTER HIS OR THEIR NAMES IN A BOOK LEFT FOR THAT PURPOSE STATING TOWNSHIP AND RANGE IN WHICH THEY RESPECTIVELY LIVE AND THEIR BUSINESS SHALL BE PROMPTLY ATTENDED TO
WHERE ROLLS THE RUSHING RIO GRANDE HOW PEACEFULLY THEY SLEEP
HE HAD NO MILITARY EXPERIENCE AND SO FAR AS THEN KNOWN NO CAPACITY FOR THE SERVICE
A WALNUT TABLE MADE BY HIM IS STILL PRESERVED AS PART OF THE FURNITURE OF THE CHURCH TO WHICH HE BELONGED
HE INTRODUCED A RESOLUTION IN FAVOR OF SECURING TO THE STATE A PART OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALES OF PUBLIC LANDS WITHIN ITS LIMITS
SHAW WOULD VOTE FOR THE CONVENTION BUT NOT FOR THOMAS THEIR CANDIDATE FOR SENATOR
ORGANIZATION OF WESTERN TERRITORIES
BEGINNING WITH SOME 20 VOTES DOUGLAS STEADILY GAINED ADHERENTS TILL ON THE 30TH BALLOT HE RECEIVED 92
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I AM GLAD YOU ARE SATISFIED AND PLEASED WITH IT
OUR DESIRE TO HAVE THIS WORK PLACED UNDER THE EYES OF THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF READERS INDUCED US TO ACCEPT THE GENEROUS OFFER OF THE CENTURY MAGAZINE TO PRINT IT FIRST IN THAT PERIODICAL
BETWEEN THE THRALDOM OF PUBLIC OPINION AND LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE
SUBSEQUENT WRANGLINGS
A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR HAD BEEN CHOSEN TWO YEARS BEFORE
IT WAS THEREFORE NOT SURPRISING THAT HE SHOULD ATTRACT THE ADMIRATION AND SUPPORT OF THE YOUNG THE ARDENT AND ESPECIALLY THE RESTLESS AND AMBITIOUS MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY
AFTER A HASTY CONSULTATION THEY AGREED UPON A PROVISO TO THE BILL WHICH WAS PRESENTED BY DAVID WILMOT OF PENNSYLVANIA
TO THE EDITOR OF THE JOURNAL IN YOUR PAPER OF LAST SATURDAY I SEE A COMMUNICATION OVER THE SIGNATURE MANY VOTERS IN WHICH THE CANDIDATES WHO ARE ANNOUNCED IN THE JOURNAL ARE CALLED UPON TO SHOW THEIR HANDS AGREED
BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND COUSINS LIVING PEACEFULLY UNDER THE GENTLE RULE OF THE GOOD STEPMOTHER BUT ALL ACKNOWLEDGING FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD THE SUPREMACY IN GOODNESS AND CLEVERNESS OF THEIR BIG BROTHER ABRAHAM
THE OFFICE OF ACTING GOVERNOR NOW DEVOLVED UPON THE SECRETARY OF THE TERRITORY DANIEL WOODSON A MAN WHO SHARED THEIR VIEWS AND WAS ALLIED TO THEIR SCHEMES
AND BY MORE DISHONEST DEVICES THAN WE CAN STOP FULLY TO RECORD THE BALLOT-BOXES WERE FILLED THROUGH INVASION FALSE SWEARING RIOT AND USURPATION WITH BALLOTS FOR WHITFIELD THE PRO-SLAVERY CANDIDATE FOR DELEGATE TO CONGRESS AT NINE OUT OF THE SEVENTEEN POLLING PLACES--SHOWING UPON A CAREFUL SCRUTINY AFTERWARDS MADE BY A COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS AN AGGREGATE OF 1729 ILLEGAL VOTES AND ONLY 1114 LEGAL ONES
SLAVE TENURE AND SLAVERY TRADITIONS IN MISSOURI DATED BACK A FULL CENTURY TO THE REMOTE DAYS WHEN THE AMERICAN BOTTOM OPPOSITE ST LOUIS WAS ONE OF THE CHIEF BREAD AND MEAT PRODUCING SETTLEMENTS OF NEW FRANCE SENDING SUPPLIES NORTHWARD TO MACKINAW SOUTHWARD TO NEW ORLEANS AND EASTWARD TO FORT DUQUESNE
THERE ARE LINCOLNS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE BELONGING TO THE SAME STOCK WITH THE PRESIDENT WHOSE NAMES ARE SPELLED LINKHORN AND LINKHERN ALL THAT WAS KNOWN OF THE EMIGRANT ABRAHAM LINCOLN BY HIS IMMEDIATE DESCENDANTS WAS THAT HIS PROGENITORS WHO WERE QUAKERS CAME FROM BERKS COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA INTO VIRGINIA AND THERE THROVE AND PROSPERED
NO HAMLET DREAMING AMID THE TURRETS OF ELSINORE NO SIDNEY CREATING A CHIVALROUS ARCADIA WAS FULLER OF MYSTIC AND SHADOWY FANCIES OF THE WORTH AND DIGNITY OF WOMAN THAN THIS BACKWOODS POLITICIAN
LOGAN 0
WE DO NOT SO MUCH REFER TO HIS EXCEPTIONAL CAREER AND HIS GREAT FIGURE IN HISTORY
1808 SIDENOTE
TWO WEEKS OF WEARY TRAMPING OVER FOREST ROADS AND MUDDY PRAIRIE AND THE DANGEROUS FORDING OF STREAMS SWOLLEN BY THE FEBRUARY THAWS BROUGHT THE PARTY TO JOHN HANKS'S PLACE NEAR DECATUR
HIS DAUGHTER SARAH OR NANCY FOR SHE WAS CALLED BY BOTH NAMES WHO MARRIED AARON GRIGSBY A FEW YEARS BEFORE HAD DIED IN CHILDBIRTH
HE DID NOT ACCUMULATE WEALTH
BERRY AND LINCOLN MERCHANTS
IT MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN ENDEMIC AMONG THE EARLY SETTLERS OF THE WEST
AND DAVID R
IN 1840 HE WAS ENGAGED IN ANOTHER SCHEME TO WHICH WE WILL GIVE A MOMENT'S ATTENTION AS IT RESULTED IN GIVING HIM A SEAT ON THE SUPREME BENCH OF THE STATE WHICH HE USED MERELY AS A PERCH FROM WHICH TO GET INTO CONGRESS
IT WAS AT LAST AMENDED BY INSERTING A SECTION CALLED THE WALKER AMENDMENT PROVIDING THAT THE PRESIDENT IF IT WERE IN HIS JUDGMENT ADVISABLE SHOULD PROCEED BY WAY OF NEGOTIATION INSTEAD OF SUBMITTING THE RESOLUTIONS AS AN OVERTURE ON THE PART OF THE UNITED STATES TO TEXAS
MATTHEWS OF THE 99TH ILLINOIS IN 1863 AT AN ABANDONED RESIDENCE NEAR INDIANOLA TEXAS
HISTORICAL MAP OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1854 SHOWING THE VARIOUS ACCESSIONS OF TERRITORY ETC
BUT IT WAS THE FASHION OF THE HOUR TO PROMISE EXACT OBEDIENCE TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND THE TWO PRACTICAL QUESTIONS TOUCHED BY THIS CIRCULAR WERE THE ONLY ONES THEN MUCH TALKED ABOUT
THE MOST POWERFUL LEADER OF THEM ALL DENOUNCED WITH BITTER EARNESTNESS THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR FOR WHICH HE WAS GREATLY RESPONSIBLE
289-90 SIDENOTE
IN ORDER TO BRING INTO FULL ACTIVITY HIS GREAT POWERS IT WAS NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD BE CONVINCED OF THE RIGHT AND JUSTICE OF THE MATTER WHICH HE ADVOCATED
OF COURSE THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS ORGANIZATION IN THE PIONEER DAYS
HE PRESCRIBED DISTINCT AND RIGID RULES FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE ELECTION
AFTER HE HAD RETIRED FROM PRACTICE THE OFFICE UNDER HIS SON-IN-LAW AND SUCCESSOR MILTON HAY RETAINED ITS PRESTIGE FOR CRADLING PUBLIC MEN
THE POINT OF HONOR WAS AS STRICTLY OBSERVED AS IT EVER HAS BEEN IN THE IDLEST AND MOST ARTIFICIAL SOCIETY
A VOLUME OF DISQUISITION COULD NOT PUT MORE CLEARLY BEFORE THE READER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THE COMMON RUN OF SOUTHERN AND WESTERN RURAL LABORERS
THE MILDEST AND THE QUIETEST OF MEN HE HAD KILLED DOZENS OF ENEMIES WITH HIS OWN HAND AND ALL THIS WITHOUT MALICE AND STRANGEST OF ALL WITHOUT INCURRING THE HATRED OF HIS ADVERSARIES

OUTBREAK OF WAR
SPEED FROM WHOSE PIOUS HAND I ACCEPTED THE PRESENT OF AN OXFORD BIBLE TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT THE PRINCIPAL MEANS BY WHICH THE CURRENT OF HIS THOUGHTS WAS CHANGED WAS NEVER DREAMED OF BY HIMSELF OR BY HIS FRIEND WHEN THEY LEFT ILLINOIS
THE PLATFORM ADOPTED REPUDIATED IN STRONG TERMS THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE AND ITS TYRANNICAL ENACTMENTS AND DECLARED THAT WE WILL ENDURE AND SUBMIT TO THESE LAWS NO LONGER THAN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE TERRITORY REQUIRE AS THE LEAST OF TWO EVILS AND WILL RESIST THEM TO A BLOODY ISSUE AS SOON AS WE ASCERTAIN THAT PEACEABLE REMEDIES SHALL FAIL IT ALSO RECOMMENDED THE FORMATION OF VOLUNTEER COMPANIES AND THE PROCUREMENT OF ARMS
WE READ OF ONE AT SPRINGFIELD AT THE RURAL HOTEL TO WHICH SIXTY GUESTS SAT DOWN WHERE THERE WERE SPEECHES BY BROWNING LINCOLN DOUGLAS WHO HAD RESIGNED HIS SEAT IN THE LEGISLATURE TO BECOME REGISTER OF THE LAND OFFICE AT THE NEW CAPITAL S
AND ALTHOUGH HE MISSED BUENA VISTA HE TOOK PART IN THE CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ AND GREATLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AT CERRO GORDO
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE DAYS FOR GOVERNOR REYNOLDS WHO ACCOMPANIED THE EXPEDITION AND WAS FORCED TO HEAR THE OUTSPOKEN COMMENTS OF TWO THOUSAND HUNGRY MEN ON HIS SUPPOSED INEFFICIENCY
ON ONE POINT ESPECIALLY THE BORDER RUFFIANS HAD A WHOLESOME DREAD
AN OPPOSING LAWYER CONTENDED THAT THIS WOULD BE CREATING A NEW BANK
THEY SPENT A GOOD PART OF THE DAY WATCHING THE HAPLESS FLAT-BOAT RESTING MIDSHIPS ON THE DAM THE FORWARD END IN THE AIR AND THE STERN TAKING IN THE TURBID SANGAMON WATER
THAT THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT ABOLISH SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AGAINST THE CONSENT OF THE CITIZENS OF SAID DISTRICT WITHOUT A MANIFEST BREACH OF GOOD FAITH
HE WAS RESERVED FOR A CAREER OF SINGULAR LUCK AND GLORY MINGLED WITH SIGNAL MISFORTUNES
THE BREAD EATEN IN TEARS OF WHICH GOETHE SPEAKS THE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS OF SORROW ARE REQUIRED FOR A CLEAR VISION OF THE CELESTIAL POWERS
WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER LINCOLN GAINED ANY VOTES THAT DAY BUT HE GAINED WHAT WAS FAR MORE VALUABLE THE ACTIVE FRIENDSHIP OF THESE ABLE AND HONORABLE MEN ALL WHIGS AND ALL KENTUCKIANS LIKE HIMSELF
THE INCLOSED MAP GIVES THE COURSES AND DISTANCES AS REQUIRED BY LAW
SLAVERY IS FOUNDED IN THE SELFISHNESS OF MAN'S NATURE--OPPOSITION TO IT IN HIS LOVE OF JUSTICE
O

IT WAS SOON FOUND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ON JOINT BALLOT WOULD PROBABLY GIVE A MAJORITY FOR SENATOR AGAINST SHIELDS THE INCUMBENT OR ANY OTHER DEMOCRAT WHO HAD SUPPORTED THE NEBRASKA BILL
THOMPSON WHO WAS THIRTY YEARS AFTERWARDS SECRETARY OF THE NAVY INSTANTLY MOVED THAT THE HOUSE DO CONCUR WITH THE SENATE WITH THIS AMENDMENT THAT THE EXISTING LAWS OF THOSE TERRITORIES BE FOR THE PRESENT AND UNTIL CONGRESS SHOULD AMEND THEM RETAINED
COOK MCLEAN EDWARDS KANE THOMAS REYNOLDS AND OTHERS THE EARLIEST LAWYERS OF THE STATE HAVE HARDLY BEEN SINCE SURPASSED FOR LEARNING AND ABILITY
BY VIRTUE OF HALF A DOZEN SIGNATURES BERRY AND LINCOLN BECAME PROPRIETORS OF THE ONLY MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENT IN THE VILLAGE AND THE APPARENT WEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY WAS INCREASED BY A LIBERAL DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR NOTES AMONG THE HERNDONS RADFORD GREENE AND A MR RUTLEDGE WHOSE BUSINESS THEY HAD ALSO BOUGHT
THE GOVERNOR'S REMOVAL
HE SAID THAT ABE KNEW MORE THAN ANY MAN IN THE UNITED STATES
THE PUBLISHED STATEMENTS OF THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY SHOW THAT UP TO THE DATE OF ELECTION IT HAD SENT ONLY A FEW HUNDRED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO THE TERRITORY
WE COMMEND THE RESULT OF SO MANY YEARS OF RESEARCH AND DILIGENCE TO ALL OUR COUNTRYMEN NORTH AND SOUTH IN THE HOPE THAT IT MAY DO SOMETHING TO SECURE A TRUTHFUL HISTORY OF THE GREAT STRUGGLE WHICH DISPLAYED ON BOTH SIDES THE HIGHEST QUALITIES OF AMERICAN MANHOOD AND MAY CONTRIBUTE IN SOME MEASURE TO THE GROWTH AND MAINTENANCE THROUGHOUT ALL OUR BORDERS OF THAT SPIRIT OF FREEDOM AND NATIONALITY FOR WHICH ABRAHAM LINCOLN LIVED AND DIED
THE WAY IN WHICH THE CONTEST WAS DECIDED AFFORDS A CURIOUS ILLUSTRATION OF THE MORAL SENSE OF THE ADVOCATES OF SLAVERY
MANY HAD SAID THEY WOULD NOT ABIDE THE NOMINATION OF TAYLOR
UP TO THIS TIME FEW PERSONS HAD CROSSED THE MOUNTAINS EXCEPT HUNTERS TRAPPERS AND EXPLORERS--MEN WHO CAME MERELY TO KILL GAME AND POSSIBLY INDIANS OR TO SPY OUT THE FERTILITY OF THE LAND FOR THE PURPOSE OF SPECULATION
210 MEANWHILE A SOBER SECOND THOUGHT HAD COME TO GOVERNOR SHANNON
THERE HAD BEEN A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN ILLINOIS FOR SOME YEARS AS TO WHETHER THE CONSTITUTION WHICH MADE VOTERS OF ALL WHITE MALE INHABITANTS OF SIX MONTHS RESIDENCE MEANT TO INCLUDE ALIENS IN THAT CATEGORY
IT IS TO THIS PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRATION OF MR DOUGLAS THAT WE MUST LOOK AS THE EXPLANATION OF HIS AGENCY IN BRINGING ABOUT THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND THE LEES WERE ALSO LARGE OWNERS OF THESE SPECULATIVE TITLES
TO REMEDY THIS DEFECT HE APPLIED HIMSELF AFTER HIS RETURN FROM CONGRESS TO SUCH WORKS UPON LOGIC AND MATHEMATICS AS HE FANCIED WOULD BE SERVICEABLE
THEY CARED FOR NOTHING SHORT OF THEIR OWN UNCONDITIONAL SCHEME OF IMMEDIATE ACTION
SPORTS AND SUPERSTITIONS OF THE EARLY SETTLERS
MAY BAKER AND LINCOLN LEFT HIM IN RAPID SUCCESSION TO GO TO CONGRESS AND FINALLY THE CONTAGION GAINED THE HEAD OF THE FIRM AND THE JUDGE WAS HIMSELF THE CANDIDATE OF HIS PARTY WHEN IT WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO ELECT ONE
THAT HE INTENDED TO PUBLISH A RELIGIOUS NEWSPAPER AND NOT TO MEDDLE WITH POLITICS
THE EVENTS OF THE NOVEMBER ELECTION EXPOSED THE DESIGNS OF THE PRO-SLAVERY CONSPIRACY AND NO COURSE WAS LEFT HIM BUT TO BECOME EITHER ITS ALLY OR ITS ENEMY
THE HON
WHEN AFTER THE LAPSE OF A QUARTER OF A CENTURY WE MEASURE HIM WITH THE VETERAN CHIEFS WHOM HE ASPIRED TO SUPPLANT WE SEE THE SUBSTANTIAL BASIS OF HIS CONFIDENCE AND AMBITION
IN SUCH CASES BEING A CONSCIENTIOUS MAN HE ALWAYS INSISTED THAT THEY SHOULD RIDE INTO THE STREAM FAR ENOUGH FOR HIM TO DISCERN THEIR FEATURES HOLDING TORCHES TO THEIR FACES BY NIGHT AND BY STORM
I NOW FIND YOU A WARM-HEARTED AND STERLING PATRIOT
FAR FROM THEIR NATIVE NORTHERN LAND FAR FROM THE FRIENDS WHO WEEP
IF HE BENT HIS GAZE TOWARDS THE GREEN EARTH IT WAS TO LOOK FOR INDIAN SIGN OR BUFFALO TRAIL
THIS IT WAS SOON APPARENT WOULD MAKE SERIOUS INROADS ON THE EXISTING DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT IT WAS MUSTERED IN BY LIEUTENANT JEFFERSON DAVIS
WHENEVER THEY HAVE SPOKEN AT ALL THEY HAVE SAID THIS
ON THIS OCCASION LINCOLN WAS THE MOST PROMINENT FIGURE
IF IT PASSED AND DID NOT MEET THE FAVOR OF THE PEOPLE JOHN GRAMMAR COULD VAUNT HIS FORESIGHT
THIS AMENDMENT PASSED AND THE SENATE HAD TO FACE THE MANY-PRONGED DILEMMA EITHER TO DEFEAT THE APPROPRIATION BILL OR TO CONSENT THAT THE TERRITORIES SHOULD BE ORGANIZED AS FREE COMMUNITIES OR TO SWALLOW THEIR PROTESTATIONS THAT THE TERRITORIES WERE IN SORE NEED OF GOVERNMENT AND ADJOURN LEAVING THEM IN THE ANARCHY THEY HAD SO FEELINGLY DEPICTED
BEFORE STARTING FOR THE WARS HE HAD ANNOUNCED HIMSELF ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE TIME BY A HANDBILL CIRCULAR AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE FROM SANGAMON COUNTY
BUT TO ENTER MYSELF AS A COMPETITOR OF OTHERS OR TO AUTHORIZE ANY ONE SO TO ENTER ME IS WHAT MY WORD AND HONOR FORBID BUT BEFORE HIS FIRST SESSION ENDED HE GAVE UP ALL IDEA OF GOING BACK AND HEARTILY CONCURRED IN THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE LOGAN TO SUCCEED HIM
THE JOINT RESOLUTION CONTAINED A GUARANTEE THAT NEW STATES OF CONVENIENT SIZE NOT EXCEEDING FOUR IN NUMBER IN ADDITION TO THE SAID STATE OF TEXAS AND TO BE FORMED OUT OF HER TERRITORY SHOULD HEREAFTER BE ENTITLED TO ADMISSION--THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE LINE TO GOVERN THE SLAVERY QUESTION IN THEM
LIFE HAD ASSUMED A MORE SETTLED AND ORDERLY COURSE
I WANT TO ASK YOU A CLOSE QUESTION ARE YOU NOW IN FEELING AS WELL AS JUDGMENT GLAD YOU ARE MARRIED AS YOU ARE
THOSE WHICH BORE THEIR PRODUCT IN THE AIR MUST BE PLANTED WHEN THE MOON SHONE
A DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE CALLED TOGETHER TO CONSIDER MERELY LOCAL AND ECONOMIC QUESTIONS WAS SITTING IN EXTRA SESSION AT SPRINGFIELD
THE BITTER INTOLERANCE OF THE JACKSON PARTY NATURALLY CAUSED THEIR OPPONENTS TO ORGANIZE AGAINST THEM AND THERE WERE TWO PARTIES IN THE STATE FROM THAT TIME FORWARD
IN HIS FIRST COUNTY HE RECEIVED A FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS FOR PROSECUTING THE PARTIES TO A SANGUINARY AFFRAY
SECONDLY TO SUBSTITUTE A CODE ABOUT WHICH THERE SHOULD BE NO QUESTION BY THE EQUALLY INGENIOUS EXPEDIENT OF COPYING AND ADOPTING THE REVISED STATUTES OF MISSOURI
HE LEARNED TO WRITE FIRST THAT HE MIGHT HAVE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT HIS PLAYMATES HAD NOT
BUT IT WAS A LARGE HORSE AS SUITED A CAVALIER OF SUCH STATURE AND TROTTED AND PACED IN A SERVICEABLE MANNER
FINALLY ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THE INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT PIERCE IN THE MIDST OF A FIERCE AND PROTRACTED STRUGGLE OVER THE APPROPRIATION BILLS WHILE THE SENATE WAS WITHOUT A QUORUM AND IMPATIENTLY AWAITING THE REPORTS OF A NUMBER OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEES DOUGLAS SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE LULL TO CALL UP HIS NEBRASKA BILL
HE HAD NO FEAR OF BAKER
WHEN SPEED RETURNED TO KENTUCKY TO A HAPPINESS WHICH AWAITED HIM THERE SO BRIGHT THAT IT DAZZLED AND BLINDED HIS MORAL VISION LINCOLN CONTINUED HIS COUNSELS AND ENCOURAGEMENTS IN LETTERS WHICH ARE REMARKABLE FOR THEIR TENDERNESS AND DELICACY OF THOUGHT AND EXPRESSION
THE HABIT REMAINED WITH HIM ALWAYS
ON THE 11TH OF MAY CONGRESS AUTHORIZED THE RAISING OF FIFTY THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS AND AS SOON AS THE INTELLIGENCE REACHED ILLINOIS THE DARING AND RESTLESS SPIRIT OF HARDIN LEAPED FORWARD TO THE FATE WHICH WAS AWAITING HIM AND HE INSTANTLY ISSUED A CALL TO HIS BRIGADE OF MILITIA IN WHICH HE SAID
BUT THE YOUNG MAN WHO DARED DECLARE IN THE PROSPEROUS BEGINNING OF HIS POLITICAL LIFE IN THE MIDST OF A COMMUNITY IMBUED WITH SLAVE-STATE SUPERSTITIONS THAT HE BELIEVED THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY WAS FOUNDED BOTH ON INJUSTICE AND BAD POLICY,"--ATTACKING THUS ITS MORAL AND MATERIAL SUPPORTS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZING ALL THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES WHICH PROTECTED IT,--HAD IN HIM THE MAKING OF A STATESMAN AND IF NEED BE A MARTYR
A BATTERED PIECE OF TIN WAS CAREFULLY SAVED AND SMOOTHED AND MADE INTO A GRATER FOR GREEN CORN
WHEAT WAS FIFTY CENTS A BUSHEL RYE THIRTY-THREE
THAT DURING THIS TIME HE WAS INCOHERENT AND DISTRAUGHT
BUT HE WAS GENEROUS AND PLACABLE AND SOME OF HIS BEST FRIENDS WERE THOSE WITH WHOM HE HAD HAD DIFFERENCES AND HAD SETTLED THEM IN THE WAY THEN PREVALENT,--IN A RING OF SERIOUS SPECTATORS CALMLY AND JUDICIALLY RUMINANT UNDER THE SHADE OF SOME SPREADING OAK AT THE EDGE OF THE TIMBER
IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS MORE AN IRREGULAR ARMY OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN CLAIMING TO BE THE SHERIFF'S POSSE WAS WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF THE TOWN
FROM THIS POINT HOWEVER HIS STRENGTH FELL AWAY
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO SEEM TO HAVE TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN OTHERS THE GENIUS OF FRIENDSHIP THE PYTHIAS THE PYLADES THE HORATIOS OF THE WORLD
THIS OFFICE IS NOT CONFINED TO MY DISTRICT BUT PERTAINS TO THE WHOLE STATE
YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT THREE MONTHS FROM NOW I WILL VENTURE THE LETTER GOES ON IN THE SAME TRAIN OF SYMPATHETIC CHEER BUT THERE IS ONE PHRASE WHICH STRIKES THE KEYNOTE OF ALL LIVES WHOSE IDEALS ARE TOO HIGH FOR FULFILLMENT
I WENT WITH THEM TO THE EXECUTIVE MANSION AND LEAVING THEM IN THE RECEPTION-ROOM SOUGHT THE PRESIDENT IN HIS PRIVATE APARTMENTS AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THE OCCASION OF THE VISIT
THE ONLY SWEETMEATS KNOWN WERE THOSE A SKILLFUL COOK COULD COMPOSE FROM THE HONEY PLUNDERED FROM THE HOLLOW OAKS WHERE THE WILD BEES HAD STORED IT
THE MEASURE ONCE PASSED AND THE COMPROMISE REPEALED THE FIRST NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO COMBINE ORGANIZE AND AGITATE FOR ITS RESTORATION
AND THE POOR THEY WOULD HAVE ALWAYS WITH THEM WHEN ONCE THEY BEGAN TO ARRIVE
I PARTICULARLY OBJECT TO THE NEW POSITION WHICH THE AVOWED PRINCIPLE OF THIS NEBRASKA LAW GIVES TO SLAVERY IN THE BODY POLITIC
HENCE THE GREAT MERIT OF THE SOUTH FINANCIALLY AND COMMERCIALLY
LINCOLN AND STUART'S LAW-OFFICE SPRINGFIELD THIS WOULD BRING ON AN ACTION FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY
ONE WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A WEEK PASSED IN SUCH UNPROFITABLE TRIFLING THE PARTIES PRINCIPAL AND SECONDARY WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO DROP THE MATTER FOREVER
STEALING A HORSE WAS PUNISHED MORE SWIFTLY AND WITH MORE FEELING THAN HOMICIDE
ON THE 12TH OF JUNE 1806 FOOTNOTE
516 TO WRITE PRINT OR CIRCULATE ANY STATEMENTS ARGUMENTS OPINIONS SENTIMENT DOCTRINE ADVICE OR INNUENDO CALCULATED TO PRODUCE A DISORDERLY DANGEROUS OR REBELLIOUS DISAFFECTION AMONG THE SLAVES OF THE TERRITORY OR TO INDUCE SUCH SLAVES TO ESCAPE FROM THE SERVICE OF THEIR MASTERS OR TO RESIST THEIR AUTHORITY WAS PRONOUNCED A FELONY PUNISHABLE BY FIVE YEARS IMPRISONMENT
BUT HIS MORE USUAL AND MORE SUCCESSFUL MANNER WAS TO RELY UPON A CLEAR STRONG LUCID STATEMENT KEEPING DETAILS IN PROPER SUBORDINATION AND BRINGING FORWARD IN A WAY WHICH FASTENED THE ATTENTION OF COURT AND JURY ALIKE THE ESSENTIAL POINT ON WHICH HE CLAIMED A DECISION
I AM IN FAVOR OF A NATIONAL BANK
BREAKFAST DINNER OR SUPPER FOR STAGE PASSENGERS 371/2
IS THE LAND ANY RICHER
NO HUMBLER CAVALCADE EVER INVADED THE INDIANA TIMBER
THE NEXT DAY FOUND THE SAME HALL FILLED AS BEFORE TO HEAR MR LINCOLN
DAVIS WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH ALMOST THE WHOLE WAR DECLARES IN FAVOR OF MR CLAY ETC RELOCATED FOOTNOTE 2
NOT ONLY BECAUSE I BELIEVED THE ALLEGATIONS UPON WHICH CONGRESS SANCTIONED THE WAR UNTRUE BUT FROM HIGH CONSIDERATIONS OF POLICY
ALSO ON THE GENERAL GROUND THAT IT CONTAINED BUT FEW WHITE INHABITANTS AND ITS ORGANIZATION WAS THEREFORE A USELESS EXPENSE
HE DETECTED WITH UNERRING SAGACITY THE WEAK POINTS OF AN OPPONENT'S ARGUMENT AND PRESSED HIS OWN VIEWS WITH OVERWHELMING STRENGTH
IF WE DO THIS WE SHALL NOT ONLY HAVE SAVED THE UNION BUT WE SHALL HAVE SO SAVED IT AS TO MAKE AND TO KEEP IT FOREVER WORTHY OF THE SAVING
HE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY AT HOME IN A COURT-ROOM
IT WILL IMPAIR OUR STANDING WITH OTHER STATES AND THE WORLD
BUT THIS EBULLITION SOON PASSED AWAY AND LEFT THAT MARVELOUSLY STRONG AND TRANSPARENT STYLE IN WHICH HIS TWO INAUGURALS WERE WRITTEN
WASHINGTON HAD ACQUIRED CLAIMS AND PATENTS TO THE AMOUNT OF THIRTY OR FORTY THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND IN THE WEST
AS SOON AS WHITESIDES RECEIVED THIS INFORMATION HE AND HIS FIERY PRINCIPAL SET OUT FOR TREMONT AND AS SHIELDS DID NOTHING IN SILENCE THE NEWS CAME TO LINCOLN'S FRIENDS TWO OF WHOM WILLIAM BUTLER AND DR MERRYMAN ONE OF THOSE COMBATIVE MEDICAL MEN WHO HAVE ALMOST DISAPPEARED FROM AMERICAN SOCIETY WENT OFF IN A BUGGY IN PURSUIT
CONSTABLES AND OVERSEERS OF THE POOR WERE APPOINTED AND ALL THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT PREPARED FOR THE POPULATION WHICH WAS HOURLY EXPECTED

THE COUNTRY LYING BETWEEN THE NUECES AND THE RIO GRANDE WAS THEN ENTIRELY UNINHABITED AND WAS THOUGHT UNINHABITABLE THOUGH SUBSEQUENT YEARS HAVE SHOWN THE FALLACY OF THAT BELIEF
THE BOGUS TERRITORIAL LAWS WERE DEFIED BY THE NEWSPAPERS AND TREATED AS A DEAD LETTER BY THE MASS OF THE FREE-STATE MEN
SEVERAL EYE WITNESSES HAVE DESCRIBED THESE SCENES IN TERMS WHICH WOULD SEEM EXAGGERATED IF THEY WERE NOT SO FULLY CONFIRMED
66 EX-GOVERNOR REEDER WAS IN ATTENDANCE ON THIS COMMITTEE SUPPLYING DATA POINTING OUT FROM PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE SOURCES OF INFORMATION CROSS-EXAMINING WITNESSES TO ELICIT THE HIDDEN TRUTH
HE WENT INTO THE CAMPAIGN WITH EXULTANT ALACRITY
THE TOPEKA CONSTITUTION
1780 IN THE YEAR 1780 ABRAHAM LINCOLN A MEMBER OF A RESPECTABLE AND WELL TO-DO FAMILY IN ROCKINGHAM COUNTY VIRGINIA STARTED WESTWARD TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF IN THE NEWLY-EXPLORED COUNTRY OF KENTUCKY
THE MONEY SPENT BY THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT DURING THE WAR AND PAID TO THE VOLUNTEERS AT ITS CLOSE ADDED TO THE COMMON PROSPERITY
HE MUST BEG FOR UNANIMOUS CONSENT FOR AN EXTENSION OF TIME TO COMPLETE HIS SPRAWLING PERORATION

SOME OF THESE VERY COLLEAGUES OF LINCOLN AT THE SPRINGFIELD BAR HAVE SAT IN CABINETS HAVE HELD THEIR OWN ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE HAVE LED ARMIES IN THE FIELD HAVE GOVERNED STATES AND ALL WITH A QUIET SELF-RELIANCE WHICH WAS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE REMOVED FROM EITHER UNDUE ARROGANCE OR UNDUE MODESTY
THE GAS WAS LIGHTED IN THE HALL THE GALLERIES WERE FILLED WITH EAGER WOMEN THE LOBBIES WERE PACKED WITH RESTLESS AND ANXIOUS MEN
HE PERHAPS DOES NOT SEE CERTAINLY DOES NOT CARE THAT THIS STUBBORN DEVOTION TO MERE JUSTICE WILL DO HIM NO GOOD AT AN HOUR WHEN THE AIR IS FULL OF THE FUMES OF GUNPOWDER
THE MOST POPULAR STATESMAN OF THAT DAY HENRY CLAY OF KENTUCKY A SLAVEHOLDER OPPOSED TO THE EXTENSION OF SLAVERY NOW HOWEVER ASSUMED THE LEADERSHIP OF A PARTY OF COMPROMISE AND THE QUARREL WAS ADJUSTED AND QUIETED BY A COMBINED SERIES OF CONGRESSIONAL ACTS
THE COMPANY ASSEMBLED ON THE GREEN AN ELECTION WAS SUGGESTED AND THREE-FOURTHS OF THE MEN WALKED OVER TO WHERE LINCOLN WAS STANDING
LINCOLN'S SPEECH JULY 27 1848
I CANNOT BUT REPROACH MYSELF FOR EVEN WISHING MYSELF TO BE HAPPY WHILE SHE IS OTHERWISE DURING THE SUMMER OF 1842 THE LETTERS OF THE FRIENDS STILL DISCUSS WITH WANING INTENSITY HOWEVER THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFAIRS OF THE HEART
WITH FEW INDIVIDUAL EXCEPTIONS YOU HAVE CONSTANTLY HAD OUR VOTES HERE FOR ALL THE NECESSARY SUPPLIES
THERE HAD BEEN VERY LITTLE OF WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED PIONEER LIFE IN SPRINGFIELD
THENCE BY AN INDEFINITE LINE TO THE RIO PECOS AND THROUGH THE ELEVATED AND BARREN LLANO ESTACADO TO THE SOURCE OF THE MAIN BRANCH OF THE RED RIVER AND ALONG THAT RIVER TO THE 100TH MERIDIAN
BUT THE GOVERNOR HAD TOO MUCH MANLINESS TO BECOME THE MERE PLIANT TOOL THEY WISHED TO MAKE HIM
THEIR SUBJECTS OF CONVERSATION WERE LIMITED THEIR RANGE OF THOUGHTS AND IDEAS NARROW AND BARREN
WE SHALL HAVE NO SPLIT OR TROUBLE ABOUT THE MATTER
THAT FORT BROWN WAS BUILT IN A MEXICAN COTTON-FIELD WHERE A YOUNG CROP WAS GROWING
IT IS HARDLY TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT HE WAS THE ONLY--AS HE WAS CERTAINLY THE LAST--INTIMATE FRIEND THAT LINCOLN EVER HAD

INDEED IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT BERRY AND LINCOLN MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED BETTER IN BUSINESS IF THE JUNIOR MEMBER OF THE FIRM HAD NOT SPENT SO MUCH OF HIS TIME READING BLACKSTONE AND CHITTY IN THE SHADE OF A GREAT OAK JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR WHILE THE SENIOR QUIETLY FUDDLED HIMSELF WITHIN
HE HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN TREATIES AND BELIEVED THAT NO MEXICAN GOVERNMENT WAS CAPABLE OF CARRYING ONE INTO EFFECT
SOMETIMES HE WAS NAILED UP IN A HOGSHEAD AND ROLLED DOWN HILL
I CANNOT CONCEIVE THAT OTHER OLD MEN FEEL DIFFERENTLY
A DEBATE BETWEEN LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS
THEIR EARLY ORPHANAGE THE WILD AND ILLITERATE LIFE THEY LED ON THE FRONTIER SEVERED THEIR CONNECTION WITH THEIR KINDRED IN THE EAST
HE DID NOT EVEN ENJOY THE LUDICROUSNESS OF IT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED

BUT IN MOST OF THEM THE MORALITY OF THE SYSTEM WAS STRONGLY DRAWN IN QUESTION ESPECIALLY BY THE ABOLITION SOCIETIES WHICH EMBRACED MANY OF THE MOST PROMINENT PATRIOTS
LINCOLN'S MAJORITY IN SANGAMON COUNTY WAS 690 WHICH IN VIEW OF THE STANDING OF HIS COMPETITOR WAS THE MOST REMARKABLE PROOF WHICH COULD BE GIVEN OF HIS PERSONAL POPULARITY

NICOLAY JOHN HAY SIGNATURES ILLUSTRATIONS VOL
NEVERTHELESS MR CYRUS EDWARDS BOLDLY MADE HIS CANVASS FOR GOVERNOR AS A SUPPORTER OF THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS AND HIS OPPONENT THOMAS CARLIN WAS CAREFUL NOT TO COMMIT HIMSELF STRONGLY ON THE OTHER SIDE
HIS VICTORIES ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPARENT EASE WITH WHICH THEY WERE GAINED HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THE CREDIT JUSTLY DUE THEM
WHAT MOTIVE FOR THIS THE LOCOS HAVE I CANNOT TELL
HE HAD PROBABLY BY THIS TIME DESPAIRED OF EVER OWNING ANY UNENCUMBERED REAL ESTATE IN INDIANA AND THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY HAD LITTLE TO BIND THEM TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY SAW NOTHING IN THE FUTURE BUT HARD WORK AND POOR LIVING
WITH THE FREE AND THE BRAVE IT WILL AFFECT NOTHING
FOLLOWING THE BAD EXAMPLE OF THE REST OF HIS COLLEAGUES HE OBTAINED THE FLOOR ON THE 27TH OF JULY AND MADE A LONG BRILLIANT AND HUMOROUS SPEECH UPON THE MERITS OF THE TWO CANDIDATES BEFORE THE PEOPLE

BUT AS HARRISON SAYS I LAUGHED AT OUR FATE AND HE JOKED AT IT AND WE ALL STARTED OFF MERRILY
BROWNLOW THAT A MINISTER NAMED MORDECAI LINCOLN A RELATIVE OF THE PRESIDENT PERFORMED ON THE 17TH OF MAY 1837 THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY OF ANDREW JOHNSON MR LINCOLN'S SUCCESOR IN THE PRESIDENCY WITH THE ONE MEMORABLE EXCEPTION THE FAMILY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MODEST THRIFTY UNAMBITIOUS PEOPLE

BAKER FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY BRADY ABOUT 1861
IT IS TOUCHING TO THINK OF THIS GREAT-SPIRITED CHILD BATTLING YEAR AFTER YEAR AGAINST HIS EVIL STAR WASTING HIS INGENUITY UPON DEVICES AND MAKESHIFTS HIS HIGH INTELLIGENCE STARVING FOR WANT OF THE SIMPLE APPLIANCES OF EDUCATION THAT ARE NOW OFFERED GRATIS TO THE POOREST AND MOST INDIFFERENT
HE WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH LITTLE GLADNESS BUT WITH A DOGGED SINCERITY AND AN INFLEXIBLE CONSCIENCE
ON ONE OCCASION HE APPEARED BEFORE JUDGE POPE TO ASK THE DISCHARGE OF THE FAMOUS MORMON PROPHET JOE SMITH WHO WAS IN CUSTODY SURROUNDED BY HIS CHURCH DIGNITARIES
HE MUST HAVE MADE SOME PART OF THE CAMPAIGN ON FOOT FOR WE FIND IN THE COUNTY PAPER AN ADVERTISEMENT OF A HORSE WHICH HAD STRAYED OR BEEN STOLEN FROM HIM WHILE ON A VISIT TO SPRINGFIELD
BUT THE NEXT YEAR A YOUNG WOMAN FROM KENTUCKY APPEARED IN THE VILLAGE TO WHOM HE PAID SUCH ATTENTIONS AS IN HIS OPINION FULLY COMMITTED HIM AS A SUITOR FOR HER HAND
HE COUNTENANCED NO ATTACK UPON HIS COMPETITOR
THE SLAVE-TRADE NOT ONLY BUT THE DOMESTIC INSTITUTION ITSELF WAS CHARACTERIZED IN LANGUAGE WHICH SOUTHERN POLITICIANS OF LATER TIMES WOULD HAVE DENOUNCED AS FANATICAL AND INCENDIARY PINCKNEY WISHED THE SLAVES TO BE REPRESENTED EQUALLY WITH THE WHITES SINCE THEY WERE THE SOUTHERN PEASANTRY
YOURS OF THE 3D INSTANT IS RECEIVED AND I PROCEED TO ANSWER IT AS WELL AS I CAN THOUGH FROM THE DEPLORABLE STATE OF MY MIND AT THIS TIME I FEAR I SHALL GIVE YOU BUT LITTLE SATISFACTION
THE AUTOCRAT OF ALL THE RUSSIAS WILL RESIGN HIS CROWN AND PROCLAIM HIS SUBJECTS FREE REPUBLICANS SOONER THAN WILL OUR AMERICAN MASTERS VOLUNTARILY GIVE UP THEIR SLAVES

NAMELY THE OPENING OF NEW ROUTES OF TRAVEL AND EMIGRATION AND OF NEW TERRITORIES FOR SETTLEMENT
THE TAVERN WAS NEVER OPENED FOR ABOUT THIS TIME LINCOLN AND BERRY WERE CHALLENGED TO SELL OUT TO A PAIR OF VAGRANT BROTHERS NAMED TRENT WHO AS THEY HAD NO IDEA OF PAYING WERE WILLING TO GIVE THEIR NOTES TO ANY AMOUNT
FROM THIS TIME FORWARD THE MAINTENANCE OF THIS BALANCE OF POWER,--THE NUMERICAL EQUALITY OF THE SLAVE STATES WITH THE FREE,--THOUGH NOT ANNOUNCED IN PLATFORMS AS A PARTY DOCTRINE WAS NEVERTHELESS STEADILY FOLLOWED AS A POLICY BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SOUTH
THIS FEELING COMMUNICATED ITSELF TO THE NORTHERN STATES AT THE VERY FIRST NOTE OF WARNING AND EVERY MAN'S PARTY FEALTY WAS AT ONCE DECIDED BY HIS TOLERATION OF OR OPPOSITION TO SLAVERY
THE JOURNALS OF THE NEXT MONTH SHOW HIS CONSTANT ACTIVITY AND PROMINENCE IN THE ROUTINE BUSINESS OF THE LEGISLATURE UNTIL IT ADJOURNED
IT WAS A GLORIOUS LIFE SAYS ONE OLD PATRIARCH
LINCOLN REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE COUNTY OF SANGAMON
MR LINCOLN IS CONTINUALLY FOUND VOTING WITH HIS FRIENDS IN FAVOR OF THIS LEGISLATION AND THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT HE SAW ANY DANGER IN IT
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,--SO UNREASONABLE IS HUMAN NATURE AS DISPLAYED AMONG POLITICIANS,--GENERAL WHITESIDES FELT THAT IF HE BORE PATIENTLY THE WINGED WORDS OF MERRYMAN HIS AVAILABILITY AS A CANDIDATE WAS GREATLY DAMAGED
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE 1 RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END IT IS A CURIOUS HISTORICAL FACT THAT UNDER THE VERY REMARKABLE MATERIAL GROWTH OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH NOW TOOK PLACE THE POLITICAL INFLUENCE REMAINED SO EVENLY BALANCED BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH FOR MORE THAN A GENERATION
GOVERNOR FORD HIMSELF A DEMOCRATIC LEADER AS ABLE AS HE WAS HONEST WRITING SEVEN YEARS AFTER THESE PROCEEDINGS CONDEMNS THEM AS WRONG AND IMPOLITIC AND ADDS EVER SINCE THIS REFORMING MEASURE THE JUDICIARY HAS BEEN UNPOPULAR WITH THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITIES
THE DAY OF PAYMENT WAS FAR AWAY AND THOSE WHO TRUSTED THE ASSURANCES OF THE SANGUINE POLITICIANS THOUGHT THAT IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY THE SCHEME WOULD PAY FOR ITSELF
HIS STRENGTH IS STILL A TRADITION IN SPENCER COUNTY
STILL HE WOULD VOTE FOR HIM IF THE CONTEST WAS TO BE SO CLOSE THAT EVERY VOTE WAS NEEDED
AND IN THAT LIGHT ALONE I NOW WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND THEM
I AM REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE HONOR OF YOUR KIND REMEMBRANCE AS WELL AS FOR THE BOOK
IT GRATIFIED HIS OFFENDED MORAL SENSE TO PROTEST AGAINST THE FALSE PRETENSES WHICH HE SAW SO CLEARLY AND IT PLEASED HIS FANCY AS A LAWYER TO BRING A TRUTH TO LIGHT WHICH SOMEBODY AS HE THOUGHT WAS TRYING TO CONCEAL
THAT IS THE SAME PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS WERE APPARENT THEN THOUGH OF COURSE IN AFTER YEARS HE EVINCED MORE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE

RAYMOND LIFE OF LINCOLN P
THAT ON SEARCH BEING MADE IT WAS FOUND THAT HIS OFFICE WAS AN OBSCURE HOLE HIS ONLY VISIBLE AUXILIARY A NEGRO BOY AND HIS SUPPORTERS A VERY FEW INSIGNIFICANT PERSONS OF ALL COLORS BUT THE LEAVEN WORKED CONTINUALLY AND BY THE TIME OF WHICH WE ARE WRITING THE ANTISLAVERY SOCIETIES OF THE NORTH-EAST HAD ATTAINED A CONSIDERABLE VITALITY AND THE ECHOES OF THEIR WORK CAME BACK FROM THE SOUTH IN FURIOUS RESOLUTIONS OF LEGISLATURES AND OTHER BODIES WHICH IN THEIR EXASPERATION COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM THIS INJUDICIOUS ADVERTISING OF THEIR ENEMIES
AT NEW ORLEANS HE SAID THEY SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME NEGROES CHAINED MALTREATED WHIPPED AND SCOURGED
14 THESE ENACTMENTS WERE MADE IN DUE FORM
FOR MYSELF I HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BEEN LEFT FAR IN THE REAR OF THE WAR AND IF NOW I VENTURE TO SAY A WORD IN BEHALF OF THOSE WHO HAVE ENDURED THE SEVEREST HARDSHIPS OF THE STRUGGLE WHETHER IN THE BLOOD-STAINED STREETS OF MONTEREY OR IN A YET STERNER FORM ON THE BANKS OF THE RIO GRANDE I BEG YOU TO BELIEVE THAT WHILE I FEEL THIS A MOST PLEASANT DUTY IT IS IN OTHER RESPECTS A DUTY FULL OF PAIN

MISSISSIPPI IN 1817 SLAVE
IT DEFINITELY FIXED THE PHRASES OLD FOGY AND YOUNG AMERICA IN OUR SLANG LITERATURE
THE YEAR 1826 IS GENERALLY TAKEN AS THE DATE WHICH WITNESSED THE CHANGE FROM PERSONAL TO PARTISAN POLITICS THOUGH SEVERAL YEARS MORE ELAPSED BEFORE THE RULE OF CONVENTIONS CAME IN WHICH PUT AN END TO INDIVIDUAL CANDIDACY
HE HAD NEVER PASSED A YEAR SINCE THE DEATH OF HIS DAUGHTER WITHOUT MAKING A PILGRIMAGE TO HER GRAVE AT OQUAWKA AND SPENDING HOURS IN MYSTIC CEREMONIES AND CONTEMPLATION
THE RETIRING MEMBER WAS NOT ALWAYS CONVINCED OF THE PROPRIETY OF THIS ARRANGEMENT
A BORDER-RUFFIAN FORAY AGAINST THE TOWN WAS HASTILY ORGANIZED
THAT AS THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES VESTS IN THE STATES AND NOT IN CONGRESS THE POWER TO LEGISLATE FOR THE RENDITION OF FUGITIVES FROM LABOR TO REPEAL AND ENTIRELY ABROGATE THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW
IN THE SPRING THEIR AMMUNITION WHICH WAS TO THEM THE ONLY NECESSARY OF LIFE RAN LOW AND ONE OF THEM MUST RETURN TO THE SETTLEMENTS TO REPLENISH THE STOCK
BUT AT THE SPECIAL SESSION OF 1835 A LAW WAS PASSED AUTHORIZING A LOAN OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PURPOSE
WE BEG HERE TO MAKE OUR SINCERE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS TO THE HUNDREDS OF FRIENDLY CRITICS WHO HAVE FURNISHED US WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION
THIS WAS THE DISCOVERY OF THE PECULIAR ADAPTATION OF THE SOIL AND CLIMATE OF PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES COMBINED WITH CHEAP SLAVE-LABOR TO THE CULTIVATION OF COTTON
THERE WERE NO ROADS AND NO BRIDGES AND THE DAY'S TASK INCLUDED A GREAT DEAL OF LABOR
A FEW PRELIMINARY MEETINGS INSTIGATED BY THE DISFRANCHISED FREE-STATE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE BROUGHT TOGETHER A LARGE MASS CONVENTION
THE HOPE OF SEEING SPRINGFIELD AN EMPORIUM OF COMMERCE WAS STILL LIVELY AMONG THE CITIZENS OF SANGAMON COUNTY AND IN NO ONE OF THE HANDBILLS OF THE POLITICAL ASPIRANTS OF THE SEASON WAS THAT HOPE MORE JUDICIOUSLY ENCOURAGED THAN IN THE ONE SIGNED BY ABRAHAM LINCOLN
WHILE STILL HOLDING THAT POSITION HE APPLIED FOR THE PLACE OF COMMISSIONER OF THE GENERAL LAND OFFICE AND HIS APPLICATION WAS SUCCESSFUL
HERE IS A LATER EPISTLE STILL MORE GRAPHIC AND TERSE IN STATEMENT WHICH HAS THE UNUSUAL MERIT OF PAINTING BOTH CONFESSOR AND PENITENT TO THE LIFE
THEY HAD AT THE VERY BEGINNING SUMMARILY OUSTED THE FREE-STATE MEMBERS CHOSEN AT THE SUPPLEMENTARY ELECTION ON MAY 22 AND SEATED THE PRO-SLAVERY CLAIMANTS OF MARCH 30
AND WHEN BROUGHT INTO COLLISION SO FIERCELY AS SLAVERY EXTENSION BRINGS THEM SHOCKS AND THROES AND CONVULSIONS MUST CEASELESSLY FOLLOW

IT SHOWS A REMARKABLE PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MINUTEST NEEDS OF THE CANVASS
THE RURAL DELEGATES TOOK ALL THE NOMINATIONS AWAY FROM SPRINGFIELD EXCEPT TWO BAKER FOR THE SENATE AND LINCOLN FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HE BEGAN BY THANKING THE HOUSE FOR ITS KINDNESS IN ALLOWING HIM THE FLOOR PROTESTING AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE HAD DONE NOTHING TO DESERVE SUCH COURTESY
AND THOUGH HE ARDENTLY DESIRED SUCCESS HE NEVER ABATED ONE JOT OR TITTLE OF HIS CONVICTIONS FOR ANY POSSIBLE PERSONAL GAIN THEN OR THEREAFTER
SLAVERY ALREADY EXISTED IN THE ENTIRE TERRITORY BY THE ACT OF THE EARLY SETTLERS FROM THE SOUTH WHO HAD BROUGHT THEIR SLAVES WITH THEM AND THE STATE OF TEXAS HAD NO VALID CLAIM TO AN INCH OF GROUND NORTH OF THE LINE OF 36 DEGREES 30 NOR ANYWHERE NEAR IT
HE WAS A CANDIDATE AGAIN IN 1838 AND WAS ELECTED OVER SO AGILE AN ADVERSARY AS STEPHEN ARNOLD DOUGLAS
AND WHILE THE TEXANS HELD SANTA ANNA PRISONER UNDER DURESS OF ARMS AND THE STRONGER PRESSURE OF HIS OWN CONSCIENCE WHICH ASSURED HIM THAT HE DESERVED DEATH AS A MURDERER HE SOLEMNLY SANCTIONED ACKNOWLEDGED AND RATIFIED THEIR INDEPENDENCE WITH WHATEVER BOUNDARIES THEY CHOSE TO CLAIM
GOVERNOR REEDER ISSUED HIS CERTIFICATE OF ELECTION WITHOUT DELAY AND WHITFIELD HURRIED AWAY TO WASHINGTON TO ENJOY HIS NEW HONORS TAKING HIS SEAT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WITHIN THREE WEEKS AFTER HIS ELECTION

BUT THE SESSION WAS ALMOST ENDED BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO GAIN THE ATTENTION OF THE SENATE FOR ITS DISCUSSION
THE BOGUS LAWS HAVING BEEN ENACTED AND THE FREE-STATE MEN HAVING AT THE BIG SPRINGS CONVENTION RESOLVED ON THE FAILURE OF PEACEABLE REMEDIES TO RESIST THEM TO A BLOODY ISSUE THE CONSPIRACY WAS NOT SLOW TO COVER ITSELF AND ITS PROJECTS WITH THE SACRED MANTLE OF AUTHORITY
THE RULING MOTIVE WHICH LED MOST OF THEM TO THE WILDS WAS THAT ANGLO-SAXON LUST OF LAND WHICH SEEMS INSEPARABLE FROM THE RACE
IN ITS CLOSE CLEAR ARGUMENT ITS FELICITY OF ILLUSTRATION ITS RESTRAINED YET BURNING EARNESTNESS IT BELONGS TO PRECISELY THE SAME CLASS OF ADDRESSES AS THOSE WHICH HE MADE A DOZEN YEARS LATER
IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THEY HAD MET IN THE FIELD OF POLITICS
AND AFTER THEY WERE ADOPTED THE SUPERIOR WEALTH EDUCATION AND BUSINESS CAPACITY OF THE WHIGS HAD THEIR LEGITIMATE INFLUENCE AND THEY FILLED THE PRINCIPAL POSITIONS UPON THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WHICH CAME INTO EXISTENCE UNDER THE ACTS
LINCOLN MET ONE DAY ON THE COURTHOUSE STEPS A YOUNG LAWYER WHO HAD LOST A CASE--HIS ONLY ONE--AND LOOKED VERY DISCONSOLATE
I AM NOW THE MOST MISERABLE MAN LIVING
IT IS DESTINED TO BECOME EXTINCT AT SOME DISTANT DAY IN MY OPINION BY THE OPERATION OF THE INEVITABLE LAWS OF POPULATION
AFTER SEVERAL YEARS RESIDENCE IN EUROPE WE RETURNED TO THIS COUNTRY AND BEGAN THE EXECUTION OF OUR LONG-CHERISHED PLAN
AT HOME HE WAS THE LIFE OF THE SINGULARLY ASSORTED HOUSEHOLD WHICH CONSISTED BESIDES HIS PARENTS AND HIMSELF OF HIS OWN SISTER MRS LINCOLN'S TWO GIRLS AND BOY DENNIS HANKS THE LEGACY OF THE DYING SPARROW FAMILY AND JOHN HANKS SON OF THE CARPENTER JOSEPH WITH WHOM THOMAS LINCOLN LEARNED HIS TRADE WHO CAME FROM KENTUCKY SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE OTHERS
AN HABITUAL DRUNKARD WAS MORE WELCOME AT RAISINGS AND LOGROLLINGS THAN A KNOWN FAINEANT
EIGHTH WHETHER THE MILITARY FORCE OF THE UNITED STATES WAS OR WAS NOT SO SENT INTO THAT SETTLEMENT AFTER GENERAL TAYLOR HAD MORE THAN ONCE INTIMATED TO THE WAR DEPARTMENT THAT IN HIS OPINION NO SUCH MOVEMENT WAS NECESSARY TO THE DEFENSE OR PROTECTION OF TEXAS
AS TO SPEECH MAKING BY WAY OF GETTING THE HANG OF THE HOUSE I MADE A LITTLE SPEECH TWO OR THREE DAYS AGO ON A POST-OFFICE QUESTION OF NO GENERAL INTEREST
I HERE THANK HIM FOR HIS COURTEOUS OFFER THE OCCASION GREATLY EQUALIZED THE RELATIVE STANDING OF THE CHAMPIONS
MR STUART WAS EITHER IN CONGRESS OR ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN CANVASSING HIS DISTRICT A GREAT PART OF THE TIME THAT HIS PARTNERSHIP WITH LINCOLN CONTINUED SO THAT THE YOUNG LAWYER WAS THROWN A GOOD DEAL ON HIS OWN RESOURCES FOR OCCUPATION
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END IT WAS MANY YEARS AFTER THE DEATH OF THE PRESIDENT THAT HIS SON LEARNED THE PROBABLE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE PIONEER LINCOLN REMOVED TO THE WEST AND THE INTIMATE RELATIONS WHICH SUBSISTED BETWEEN HIS FAMILY AND THE MOST CELEBRATED MAN IN EARLY WESTERN ANNALS
BUT THE PEOPLE WERE A LAW UNTO THEMSELVES
HIS LAST SCHOOL-DAYS WERE PASSED WITH ONE SWANEY IN 1826 WHO TAUGHT AT A DISTANCE OF FOUR AND A HALF MILES FROM THE LINCOLN CABIN
HE HAD RECEIVED THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE ILLINOIS DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS AND IT IS ALTOGETHER PROBABLE THAT HE OWED HIS APPOINTMENT IN GREAT MEASURE TO THE INFLUENCE OF DOUGLAS WHO DESIRED TO HAVE AS FEW DEMOCRATIC STATESMEN AS POSSIBLE IN SPRINGFIELD THAT WINTER

HERE WAS A CHANCE TO PUT THE FREE-STATE MOVEMENT POINTEDLY UNDER THE BAN OF FEDERAL AUTHORITY WHICH THE CABAL DETERMINED NOT TO NEGLECT
HE THEN ENTERS UPON AN ANALYSIS OF THE POSITION OF CASS AND HIS PARTY WHICH IS FULL OF KEEN OBSERVATION AND POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE AND HIS SPEECH GOES ON TO ITS ROLLICKING CLOSE WITH A CONSTANT SUCCESSION OF BRIGHT WITTY AND STRIKING PASSAGES IN WHICH THE ORATOR'S OWN CONVICTION AND ENJOYMENT OF AN ASSURED SUCCESS IS NOT THE LEAST REMARKABLE FEATURE

BUT ON THE FOURTH BALLOT THE SOLDIER OF BUENA VISTA WAS NOMINATED AND MILLARD FILLMORE PLACED IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION TO HIM
THEREFORE WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR ALL OF THESE QUALITIES AT ONCE TO BE PUT TO THE MOST STRENUOUS PROOF THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS DEVELOPMENT AND THE TENDENCY OF HIS NATURE MADE IT INEVITABLE THAT HIS SUFFERING SHOULD BE OF THE KEENEST AND HIS FINAL TRIUMPH OVER HIMSELF SHOULD BE OF THE MOST COMPLETE AND SIGNAL CHARACTER
APPENDIX 1849-50 PP
THIS SMALL PARTY OF ANTISLAVERY VETERANS OVER 158,000 VOTERS IN THE AGGREGATE AND DISTRIBUTED IN DETACHMENTS OF FROM 3000 TO 30,000 IN TWELVE OF THE FREE STATES NOW CAME TO THE FRONT AND WITH ITS NEWSPAPERS AND SPEAKERS TRAINED IN THE DISCUSSION OF THE SUBJECT AND ITS COMMITTEES AND AFFILIATIONS ALREADY IN ACTION AND CORRESPONDENCE BORE THE BRUNT OF THE FIGHT AGAINST THE REPEAL
HE PERSISTED IN DECLARING THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD PASS NO VALID LAWS AT ANY OTHER PLACE THAN PAWNEE AND RETURNED THE FIRST BILL SENT HIM WITH A VETO MESSAGE TO THAT EFFECT
HE DIED IN 1872 EIGHTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE HAVING BAPTIZED TWELVE THOUSAND PERSONS AND PREACHED FIFTEEN THOUSAND SERMONS
J.N
THE IMPROVEMENT OF ROADS WHICH MADE CARRIAGES A POSSIBILITY HAD EFFECTED A GREAT CHANGE AND THE COMING OF THE RAILWAY HAD COMPLETED THE SUDDEN DEVELOPMENT OF THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE MODERNIZED COMMUNITY
BAKER SUCCESSFUL
AS A WHIG I STILL OCCUPY A PLACE ON THIS FLOOR
PRESTON KING OF NEW LAND OF MICHIGAN HAD BECOME ALARMED AS TO THE DISPOSITION THAT MIGHT BE MADE OF THE TERRITORY THUS ACQUIRED WHICH WAS NOW FREE SOIL BY MEXICAN LAW
NICOLAY AND JOHN HAY
THE SCHOOLS WERE MUCH ALIKE
SUCH IS THE WAY THE THING WAS DONE
7 1881 WHATEVER DOUBTS MIGHT BE ENTERTAINED AS TO WHETHER HE WAS THE ABLEST LAWYER ON THE CIRCUIT THERE WAS NEVER ANY DISSENT FROM THE OPINION THAT HE WAS THE ONE MOST CORDIALLY AND UNIVERSALLY LIKED
THE REPUBLIC WAS IN A MORE THRIVING CONDITION THAN EVER BEFORE
THEIR VETERINARY PRACTICE WAS MOSTLY BY CHARMS AND INCANTATIONS
OF THE REMAINING 2286 ACTUAL KANSAS VOTERS DISCLOSED BY SEEDER'S CENSUS ONLY 791 CAST THEIR BALLOTS
THE SOBER FACT IS THAT THE LIFE WAS A HARD ONE WITH FEW RATIONAL PLEASURES FEW WHOLESOME APPLIANCES
LOGAN WERE MADE CANDIDATES FOR THE LEGISLATURE
SHOULD THEY BE REPRESENTED
HE COULD OUTRUN A DOG OR A DEER
WE HEAR SOMETIMES OF A WHOLE CONGREGATION PROSTRATED AS BY A HURRICANE FLINGING THEIR LIMBS ABOUT IN FURIOUS CONTORTIONS WITH WILD OUTCRIES
EVEN KILLING THE DOG WOULD NOT CURE THE BITE
BUT THEY WERE UTTERLY UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING EXCEPT BY DIVIDING THE JACKSON MEN WHOSE VERY NUMBERS MADE THEIR PARTY UNWIELDY AND BY THROWING THEIR VOTES WITH THE MORE DECENT AND CONSERVATIVE PORTION OF THEM
ALL HAD FORGOTTEN THE LAPSE OF HOURS THEIR FATIGUE AND THEIR HUNGER IN THE ABSORPTION OF THE FLUCTUATING CONTEST
IT WAS A DAY OF HOPE AND PROMISE WHEN THE ADVERTISEMENT REACHED SPRINGFIELD FROM CINCINNATI THAT THE SPLENDID UPPER-CABIN STEAMER TALISMAN WOULD POSITIVELY START FOR THE SANGAMON ON A GIVEN DAY
AND MY ONLY OUTLAY WAS SEVENTY-FIVE CENTS FOR A BARREL OF CIDER WHICH SOME FARM-HANDS INSISTED I SHOULD TREAT THEM TO HE WAS CALLED DOWN TO VANDALIA IN THE SUMMER OF 1837 BY A SPECIAL SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE
NO ONE EVER EQUALED HIM IN HIS KNOWLEDGE OF INDIAN CHARACTER AND HIS INFLUENCE WITH THE SAVAGES WAS A MYSTERY TO HIM AND TO THEMSELVES
AFFIRMING THAT THE COMPROMISE MEASURES OF 1850 HAD GIVEN REPOSE TO THE COUNTRY HE DECLARED THAT THIS REPOSE IS TO SUFFER NO SHOCK DURING MY OFFICIAL TERM IF I HAVE THE POWER TO AVERT IT THOSE WHO PLACED ME HERE MAY BE ASSURED IN THIS SPIRIT UNDOUBTEDLY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE SOUTH BEGAN THE SESSION OF 1853-4
SPEECH AT ATCHISON CITY SEPTEMBER 1854 REPORTED IN THE PARKVILLE LUMINARY SENATOR DIXON IS NO LESS EXPLICIT IN HIS DESCRIPTION OF THESE POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS
NOW THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN BY SOME DEFECT IN YOUR CONDUCT
HISTORY SHEDS LITTLE LIGHT ON THE OFFICIAL TRANSACTION BUT CONTEMPORARY EVIDENCE POINTS TO THE INFLUENCE OF A POWERFUL LOBBY
IT COMMENCED SAYS GOVERNOR FORD IN HIS ADMIRABLE CHRONICLE AT CHICAGO AND WAS THE MEANS OF BUILDING UP THAT PLACE IN A YEAR OR TWO FROM A VILLAGE OF A FEW HOUSES TO BE A CITY OF SEVERAL THOUSAND INHABITANTS
BUT THE SHERIFF HOARDED UP THE SCORE FOR FUTURE REVENGE
THE TASTE FOR CIVILIZATION HAD SOMETIMES A WHIMSICAL MANIFESTATION
THE SETTLERS WERE BUSY WITH THEIR SPRING CROPS
FASTENING THIS PROPOSITION UPON THE BILL TO ADMIT MAINE AS A FREE STATE THE MEASURE WAS AFTER A STRUGGLE CARRIED THROUGH CONGRESS IN A SEPARATE ACT APPROVED MARCH 6 1820 AND BECAME THE FAMOUS MISSOURI COMPROMISE
AND AS THE CANVASS GAINED MOMENTUM AND VEHEMENCE A CURIOUS KIND OF MUSIC ADDED ITS INSPIRATION TO THE CAUSE
ICHABOD RAVED SAID THE DEMOCRATIC ORGAN IN DERISION AND LOVEJOY SWELLED AND ALL INDORSED THE SENTIMENTS OF THAT SPEECH NOT CONTENT WITH THIS WITHOUT CONSENT OR CONSULTATION THEY PLACED LINCOLN'S NAME IN THE LIST OF THEIR STATE CENTRAL COMMITTEE
WE ARE AWARE OF THE PREJUDICE WHICH EXISTS AGAINST A BOOK WRITTEN BY TWO PERSONS BUT WE FEEL THAT IN OUR CASE THE DISADVANTAGES OF COLLABORATION ARE REDUCED TO THE MINIMUM
BUT AFTER HE BEGAN SPEAKING I BECAME VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HIM
WILSON AND ANDREW MCCORMICK CANDIDATES FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND JOB FLETCHER FOR THE SENATE OF ILLINOIS
IN THE MEAN TIME THE DAUNTLESS SPECULATOR RICHARD HENDERSON HAD BEGUN HIS OCCUPATION WITH ALL THE POMP OF VICEROYALTY
THE LANGUAGE OF HIS MESSAGE PLAINLY BETRAYED THE POLITICAL DILEMMA IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF
LETTER FROM THE REV
SHANNON TO PRESIDENT PIERCE DECEMBER 11 1855 SENATE EX
THE MISSOURI BLUE LODGES
HARDIN EDWARD D
IN THE SESSION OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN 1856 TWO SENATORS FROM THE SLAVE-HOLDING STATE OF KANSAS WILL TAKE THEIR SEATS AND ABOLITIONISM WILL BE FOREVER DRIVEN FROM OUR HALLS OF LEGISLATION AGAINST THIS TRIUMPHANT ATTITUDE GOVERNOR REEDER WAS DESPONDENT AND POWERLESS
COLONEL JOHN TODD WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL PROPRIETORS OF THE TOWN OF LEXINGTON KY
IN THAT CASE THEY WOULD HAVE WAITED LONG FOR THE RECOGNITION OF THEIR TALENTS OR A DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES
THE BOSTON ATLAS REFERS TO SPEECHES MADE BY HIM AT DORCHESTER SEPTEMBER 16
THE ARGUMENT BASED ON IMAGINARY BRITISH INTRIGUES WAS THE ONE MOST RELIED UPON BY MR TYLER'S SUCCESSIVE SECRETARIES OF STATE
THE VOICE OF REASON SEEMED TO BE SILENT IN THE ASSEMBLY
THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROCLAMATION WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMPREHENSIVE TO INCLUDE BORDER RUFFIANS AND EMIGRANT AID SOCIETIES AS WELL AS THE TOPEKA MOVEMENT AND THUS PRESENTED A SHOW OF IMPARTIALITY
MAY SHE NOT ENTER INTO AN ALLIANCE WITH TEXAS
POLK SIDENOTE
SHOULD THE POWER TO REGULATE COMMERCE BE ALLOWED TO CONTROL OR TERMINATE THEIR IMPORTATION
THE CROWD HEARD HIM IN SULLEN SILENCE FOR THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR WHEN THEIR PATIENCE GAVE OUT AND THEY BEGAN TO PLY HIM WITH QUESTIONS
AFTER BAKER'S ELECTION IN 1844 IT WAS GENERALLY TAKEN AS A MATTER OF COURSE IN THE DISTRICT THAT LINCOLN WAS TO BE THE NEXT CANDIDATE OF THE WHIG PARTY FOR CONGRESS
ACTING UPON HIMSELF THIS RENEWED PRACTICE ON THE STUMP CRYSTALLIZED HIS THOUGHT AND BROUGHT METHOD TO HIS ARGUMENT
BUT A SUITOR FOR OFFICE SO LAGGARD AND SO SCRUPULOUS AS HE STOOD VERY LITTLE CHANCE OF SUCCESS IN CONTESTS LIKE THOSE WHICH PERIODICALLY RAGED AT WASHINGTON DURING THE FIRST WEEKS OF EVERY NEW ADMINISTRATION
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT A RESIDENCE IN WASHINGTON LEAVES NO MAN PRECISELY AS IT FOUND HIM
TAYLOR ELECTED CHAPTER XVI
THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO OFFICE WHICH LINCOLN MADE AFTER THE INAUGURATION OF GENERAL TAYLOR ARE PROBABLY UNIQUE OF THEIR KIND
IT IS RELATED BY OLD CITIZENS OF MENARD COUNTY AS A CIRCUMSTANCE GREATLY TO THE CREDIT OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN THAT WHEN HE WAS A CANDIDATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE A MAN WHO WANTED HIS VOTE FOR ANOTHER PLACE WALKED TO THE POLLS WITH HIM AND OSTENTATIOUSLY VOTED FOR HIM HOPING TO RECEIVE HIS VOTE IN RETURN
THE LAW AND ORDER PARTY FORMED AT LEAVENWORTH
THE SUBJECT WAS NOT YET RIPE FOR ACTION DURING THE STORMY POLITICS OF 1850-1 AND HAD AGAIN TO BE POSTPONED FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF 1852
HE STROVE AS BEST HE MIGHT TO COUPLE TOGETHER THE PREVAILING CANT OF OFFICE-HOLDERS AGAINST THE DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF ABOLITIONISM AND A COMPARATIVELY MILD REBUKE OF THE MISSOURI USURPATION
WHEN WE CONSIDER THE PINCHING POVERTY IN WHICH THESE YEARS HAD BEEN PASSED WE MAY APPRECIATE THE SELF-DENIAL DENIAL WHICH HAD KEPT HIM FROM MAKING EVEN A TEMPORARY USE OF THIS LITTLE SUM OF GOVERNMENT MONEY
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE HABIT HE SAYS OF ACCEDING TO ALMOST ANY PROPOSAL THAT A FRIEND WOULD MAKE AND I AM TRULY SORRY THAT I CANNOT TO THIS A MONTH LATER HARDIN SAW THAT HIS CANDIDACY WAS USELESS AND HE PUBLISHED A CARD WITHDRAWING FROM THE CONTEST WHICH WAS PRINTED AND COMMENDED IN THE KINDEST TERMS BY PAPERS FRIENDLY TO LINCOLN AND THE TWO MEN REMAINED ON TERMS OF CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP
THE SUBSTITUTION OF HIS NAME WAS A PROMISING DEVICE
HE COULD NOT EVEN WAIT FOR THE ADJOURNMENT OF CONGRESS TO BEGIN HIS STUMP-SPEAKING
GOVERNOR REEDER'S INDEPENDENT ACTION
THEY WERE THERE BESIEGED BY THE INFURIATED CROWD AND AFTER A SHORT INTERCHANGE OF SHOTS LOVEJOY WAS KILLED HIS FRIENDS DISPERSED AND THE PRESS ONCE MORE--AND THIS TIME FINALLY--THROWN INTO THE TURBID FLOOD
IT IS A FATAL BLOW AT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDGES AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL TERM OF THEIR OFFICES
HIS OWN PARTNER MR HERNDON A YOUNG AND ARDENT MAN WITH MORE HEART THAN LEARNING MORE FEELING FOR THE FLAG THAN FOR INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND MR LINCOLN'S POSITION AND GAVE HIM GREAT PAIN BY HIS LETTERS
DEATH OF THOMAS LINCOLN
THE TEACHERS WERE USUALLY IN KEEPING WITH THEIR PRIMITIVE SURROUNDINGS
THE TUMULTUOUS PROCEEDING CONTINUED UNTIL HALF-PAST TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN THE BAFFLED ORATOR WAS FINALLY BUT VERY RELUCTANTLY PERSUADED BY HIS FRIENDS TO GIVE UP THE CONTEST AND LEAVE THE STAND
LINCOLN WAS THUS LEFT LOADED WITH DEBTS AND WITH NO ASSETS EXCEPT WORTHLESS NOTES OF BERRY AND THE TRENTS
THE EARLIER EMIGRANTS PRINCIPALLY OF THE POORER CLASS OF SOUTHERN FARMERS SHUNNED THE PRAIRIES WITH SOMETHING OF A SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD
IT HAS BEEN GRAVELY ASSERTED THAT THIS INDEMNITY OF TEN MILLIONS SUDDENLY TREBLING THE VALUE OF THE TEXAS DEBT AND THEREBY AFFORDING AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY FOR SPECULATION IN THE BONDS OF THAT STATE WAS THE PROPELLING FORCE WHEREBY THESE ACTS WERE PUSHED THROUGH CONGRESS IN DEFIANCE OF THE ORIGINAL CONVICTIONS OF A MAJORITY OF ITS MEMBERS BUT IT MUST ALSO BE ADMITTED THAT THE POPULAR DESIRE FOR TRANQUILLITY CONCORD AND UNION IN ALL SECTIONS NEVER EXERTED SO MUCH INFLUENCE UPON CONGRESS AS THEN
SECOND WHETHER THAT SPOT IS OR IS NOT WITHIN THE TERRITORY WHICH WAS WRESTED FROM SPAIN BY THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO
BUT FROM WHAT THEN AND AFTERWARDS CAME TO LIGHT IT APPEARS THAT MR THAYER'S SOCIETY WAS THE ONLY ONE WHOSE OPERATIONS REACHED ANY DEGREE OF SUCCESS DESERVING HISTORICAL NOTICE
THE GREAT WESTWARD STREAM OF EMIGRATION IN THE UNITED STATES HAD GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE PARALLELS OF LATITUDE
GENERALLY THE REPLIES WERE NOT ONLY AFFIRMATIVE BUT CORDIAL AND EVEN ENTHUSIASTIC
IT IS RELATED OF ONE STOUT ONE OF THE LEGENDARY NIMRODS OF ILLINOIS WHO WAS WELL AND FREQUENTLY MARRIED THAT HE HAD ONE UNFAILING FORMULA OF COURTSHIP
HE HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH PARIS WHOM HE BITTERLY REPROACHED MUCH LESS WITH HELEN
HE WAS NEVER OVERCONFIDENT
THE TOPEKA CONSTITUTION THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE DEFINES KANSAS POLITICS
ON THE 23D THE LETTER TO STUART WAS WRITTEN
BLACK HAWK'S DEFEAT
THESE PRINCIPLES ARE AN ETERNAL ANTAGONISM
THIS CONDITION SEEMED SO FAIR WHEN FIRST PRESENTED TO THE NORTHERN CONSCIENCE THAT ONLY THREE MEMBERS FROM THE FREE STATES VOTED NO IN COMMITTEE
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MISTAKE THE ACCENT OF SINCERE MOURNING WHICH WE FIND IN THE JOURNALS OF THE TIME
FEB
AS IT TURNED OUT A GREAT VARIETY OF PARTY NAMES WERE RETAINED OR ADOPTED IN THE CONGRESSIONAL AND STATE CAMPAIGNS OF 1854 THE DESIGNATION OF ANTI NEBRASKA BEING PERHAPS THE MOST COMMON AND CERTAINLY FOR THE MOMENT THE MOST SERVICEABLE SINCE DENUNCIATION OF THE NEBRASKA BILL WAS THE ONE ALL-PERVADING BOND OF SYMPATHY AND AGREEMENT AMONG MEN WHO DIFFERED VERY WIDELY ON ALMOST ALL OTHER POLITICAL TOPICS
HE HASTENED TO LAWRENCE WHICH NOW INVOKED HIS PROTECTION
HE COULD THREAD THE WOODS WITHOUT FOOD DAY AND NIGHT
HE SELECTED A SPOT WHICH PLEASED HIM IN HIS FIRST DAY'S JOURNEY
DISSOLUTION OF THE WHIG PARTY
TO RESTORE KANSAS AND NEBRASKA TO THE POSITION OF FREE TERRITORIES
ROBINSON KANSAS PP
BOTH THE FACTIONS WHICH HAD COME SO NEAR TO ACTUAL BATTLE IN THE WAKARUSA WAR THOUGH NOMINALLY DISBANDED IN REALITY CONTINUED THEIR MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS,--THE FREE-STATE MEN THROUGH APPREHENSION OF DANGER THE BORDER RUFFIANS BECAUSE OF THEIR PURPOSE TO CRUSH OUT OPPOSITION
LATE IN LIFE MORDECAI LINCOLN REMOVED TO HANCOCK COUNTY ILLINOIS WHERE HIS DESCENDANTS STILL LIVE ILLUSTRATION
BUT SINCE THE NORTH WAS NOT YET FREE FROM SLAVERY BUT ONLY IN PROCESS OF BECOMING SO AND AS VIRGINIA WAS THE LEADING STATE OF THE UNION THE REAL BALANCE OF POWER REMAINED IN THE HANDS OF THE SOUTH
AND I FEAR THE FEW VOTES HE WILL GET WILL BE TAKEN FROM US
THE PRESIDENT SHOWED IN HIS MESSAGE THAT HE WAS DOUBTFUL OF THE VERDICT OF CONGRESS AND THE COUNTRY UPON THE YEAR'S OPERATIONS AND HE ARGUED WITH MORE SOLICITUDE THAN FORCE IN DEFENSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN REGARD TO THE WAR WITH MEXICO
HE WAS HIS CLOSEST COMPANION IN SPRINGFIELD AND IN THE EVIL DAYS WHEN THE LETTER TO STUART WAS WRITTEN HE TOOK HIM WITH BROTHERLY LOVE AND AUTHORITY UNDER HIS SPECIAL CARE
THE WHIGS OF OUR DISTRICT SAY THAT EVERYTHING IS IN FAVOR OF HOLDING THE ELECTION NEXT SUMMER EXCEPT THE FACT OF YOUR ABSENCE
FOR IN THAT DAY THIS DREARY ROUTE FURNISHED NO HORSES TO BUY OR TO STEAL
STILLMAN'S RUN
WHEN AT LAST THEY WERE DRIVEN OUT BY THE FEAR OF FAMINE THE LABOR OF ESTABLISHING COMMUNICATIONS WAS ENORMOUS
IT TOOK FAST HOLD OF HIM AND DRAGGED HIM INTO AWFUL DEPTHS OF DARKNESS AND TORTURE
IF WE ARE DEFEATED THEN MISSOURI AND THE OTHER SOUTHERN STATES WILL HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES RECREANT TO THEIR INTERESTS AND WILL DESERVE THEIR FATE WESTERN WATER TRANSPORTATION FOUND ITS NATURAL TERMINUS WHERE THE KAW OR KANSAS RIVER EMPTIES INTO THE MISSOURI
THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY IS ONE THAT CONVULSES THE WHOLE COUNTRY FROM THE BOISTEROUS ATLANTIC TO THE SHORES OF THE MILD PACIFIC
THEY FORMED IT IS TRUE RATHER AN AIRY AND UNSUBSTANTIAL SORT OF POSSESSION THE SAME GROUND BEING OFTEN CLAIMED BY A DOZEN DIFFERENT PERSONS OR COMPANIES UNDER VARIOUS GRANTS FROM THE CROWN OR FROM LEGISLATURES OR THROUGH PURCHASE BY ADVENTURERS FROM INDIAN COUNCILS
JOHN HANKS SAYS
I CAN DISTRESS A WIDOWED MOTHER AND HER SIX FATHERLESS CHILDREN AND THEREBY GET FOR YOU SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH RIGHTFULLY BELONGS IT APPEARS TO ME AS MUCH TO THEM AS IT DOES TO YOU
THEY COMPRISE ADDITIONAL CHAPTERS ALMOST EQUAL IN EXTENT AND FULLY EQUAL IN INTEREST TO THOSE WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN PRINTED IN THE CENTURY INTERSPERSED THROUGHOUT THE WORK IN THEIR PROPER CONNECTION AND SEQUENCE AND CONTAINING SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF MR LINCOLN'S LETTERS THEY LEND BREADTH AND UNITY TO THE HISTORICAL DRAMA
THE NINTH BALLOT GAVE HIM 47 VOTES
AT THAT EARLY DAY AN ELECTION TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE MUST HAVE SEEMED TO LINCOLN A MOST BRILLIANT POLITICAL PRIZE THE HIGHEST PERHAPS TO WHICH HE THEN HAD ANY HOPES OF EVER ATTAINING
GEORGE WASHINGTON AND HIS FELLOW DELEGATES WERE GRAPPLING WITH THE NOVEL PROBLEMS OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THE HAPPY ISSUE OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE LAMENTABLE FAILURE OF THE CONFEDERATION FORCED UPON THE COUNTRY
AND WHEN A PERSON BELIEVED HIMSELF BEWITCHED A SHOT AT THE IMAGE OF THE WITCH WITH A BULLET MELTED OUT OF A HALF-DOLLAR WAS THE FAVORITE CURATIVE AGENCY
THEY KNEW THE INMOST THOUGHTS OF EACH OTHER'S HEARTS AND EACH RELIED UPON THE HONESTY AND LOYALTY OF THE OTHER TO AN EXTENT RARE AMONG MEN
A MAN WOULD FOR HIS CONVENIENCE LAY DOWN AN IRASCIBLE NEIGHBOR'S FENCE AND INDOLENTLY FORGET TO PUT IT UP AGAIN AND AN ACTION OF TRESPASS WOULD GROW OUT OF IT
BUT UNDER THE CLUMSY LEGISLATIVE MACHINERY OF THE CONFEDERATION THESE SEVEN NOES CARRIED THE QUESTION SINCE A MAJORITY OF STATES HAD FAILED TO VOTE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
THEY RECEIVED PERHAPS FIFTY DOLLARS FROM THE MISSIONARY FUND AND HALF AS MUCH MORE FROM THEIR CONGREGATIONS PAID FOR THE MOST PART IN NECESSARIES OF LIFE
LAW APPROVED DEC
HOLDING THE INDIVIDUAL OPINION THAT THE APPOINTMENT OF A DIFFERENT GENTLEMAN WOULD BE BETTER I ASK ESPECIAL ATTENTION AND CONSIDERATION FOR HIS CLAIMS AND FOR THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED IN HIS FAVOR BY THOSE OVER WHOM I CAN CLAIM NO SUPERIORITY THE CANDOR THE FAIRNESS AND MODERATION TOGETHER WITH THE RESPECT FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE WHICH THESE RECOMMENDATIONS DISPLAY ARE ALL THE MORE REMARKABLE WHEN WE REFLECT THAT THERE WAS AS YET NO SIGN OF A PUBLIC CONSCIENCE UPON THE SUBJECT
A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AT TOPEKA
ANDREW H REEDER APPOINTED GOVERNOR
THE TEDIOUS WORK OF CLEANING THE FIBER FROM THE SEED APPARENTLY MADE IMPOSSIBLE ITS CHEAP PREPARATION FOR EXPORT IN LARGE QUANTITIES
603
THEIR RESOLUTIONS WERE RADICAL FOR THAT DAY BUT NOT SO EXTREME AS WAS GENERALLY FEARED
OUT OF THESE DIVERGENT VIEWS GREW THE COMPROMISES OF THE CONSTITUTION
AROUND THE BURGOO-POT OF THE HUNTING PARTY THEY DISCUSSED MEASURES AND CANDIDATES
CALHOUN IN HIS DISPATCH OF THE 12TH OF AUGUST 1844 INSTRUCTED OUR MINISTER IN PARIS TO IMPRESS UPON THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE THE NEFARIOUS CHARACTER OF THE ENGLISH DIPLOMACY WHICH WAS SEEKING BY DEFEATING THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS TO ACCOMPLISH THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY FIRST IN THAT REGION AND AFTERWARDS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES A BLOW CALAMITOUS TO THIS CONTINENT BEYOND DESCRIPTION NO DENIALS ON THE PART OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAD ANY EFFECT
HE CONTINUED TO AID AND BEFRIEND THEM IN EVERY WAY EVEN WHEN HE COULD ILL AFFORD IT AND WHEN HIS BENEFACTIONS WERE IMPRUDENTLY USED

SEVERAL BORDER BULLIES AT DIFFERENT TIMES CROWDED HIM INDISCREETLY AND WERE PROMPTLY AND THOROUGHLY WHIPPED
LINCOLN 36
HIS GREAT STRENGTH AND INTELLIGENCE MADE HIM A VALUABLE LABORER AND HIS UNFAILING GOOD TEMPER AND FLOW OF RUDE RUSTIC WIT RENDERED HIM THE MOST AGREEABLE OF COMRADES
NO WONDER SAID SOME FACETIOUS CAVALIER THERE IS SO MUCH OF YOU ON THE GROUND FOOTNOTE
AND HE WAS GREATLY DIVERTED WHEN HE NOTICED ME BEHIND HIM STEPPING ALONG IN HIS TRACKS TO KEEP FROM SLIPPING THUS THE TWO COMRADES CAME BACK FROM THEIR SOLDIERINGS TO THEIR HUMBLE HOMES FROM WHICH LINCOLN WAS SOON TO START ON THE WAY MARKED OUT FOR HIM BY PROVIDENCE WITH STRIDES WHICH NO COMRADE WITH WHATEVER GOODWILL MIGHT HOPE TO FOLLOW
HIS TALENTS AND SERVICES ENDEAR HIM TO THE WHIG PARTY
PARROTT GUARDIAN RICHARD BERRY WAS A CONNECTION OF LINCOLN
ON ONE OCCASION HE TURNED SUDDENLY TO HIS ASSOCIATE AND SAID
IN THE POSSESSION OF COLONEL REUBEN T
BUT HE PAID AT LAST EVERY FARTHING OF THE DEBT WHICH SEEMED TO HIM AND HIS FRIENDS SO LARGE THAT IT WAS CALLED AMONG THEM THE NATIONAL DEBT ILLUSTRATION
WHAT I DO SAY IS THAT NO MAN IS GOOD ENOUGH TO GOVERN ANOTHER MAN WITHOUT THAT OTHER'S CONSENT
IT IS QUITE CERTAIN I DID NOT BREAK MY SWORD FOR I HAD NONE TO BREAK BUT I BENT MY MUSKET PRETTY BADLY ON ONE OCCASION
MEMOIR OF ELI WHITNEY AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE 1832 IT SO HAPPENED THAT AT THIS JUNCTURE NOVEMBER 1792 AN INGENIOUS YANKEE STUDENT FROM MASSACHUSETTS WAS BOARDING IN THE HOUSE OF FRIENDS IN SAVANNAH GEORGIA OCCUPYING HIS LEISURE IN READING LAW
IN FACT LANDS AND TOWN LOTS WERE THE STAPLE OF THE COUNTRY AND WERE THE ONLY ARTICLE OF EXPORT THE CONTAGION SPREAD SO RAPIDLY TOWNS AND CITIES WERE LAID OUT SO PROFUSELY THAT IT WAS A STANDING JOKE THAT BEFORE LONG THERE WOULD BE NO LAND LEFT IN THE STATE FOR FARMING PURPOSES
THE MARSHAL AND HIS POSSE INCLUDING SHERIFF JONES WENT AMONG OTHER INVITED GUESTS AND ENJOYED THE PROFFERED HOSPITALITY
TRUMBULL 5
BOTH TO SECURE THE PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT OF SLAVERY IN KANSAS AND TO GRATIFY THE PERSONAL PRIDE OF THEIR TRIUMPH THEY WERE DETERMINED TO MAKE THESE RECUSANT FREE STATE VOTERS BOW DOWN TO THE CAP OF GESSLER DESPOTISM IS NEVER MORE ARROGANT THAN IN RESENTING ALL SLIGHTS TO ITS PERSONAL VANITY
THE PROMPTINGS OF HIS OWN BROKEN HEART READILY SEEMED TO HIM THE WHISPERINGS OF ATTENDANT SPIRITS
934 SIDENOTE
I WAS NOT AT STILLMAN'S DEFEAT BUT I WAS ABOUT AS NEAR IT AS GENERAL CASS WAS TO HULL'S SURRENDER
HE ASKED THAT HE MIGHT BE MET AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER BY TEN OR TWELVE MEN HAVING AXES WITH LONG HANDLES TO CUT AWAY THE OVERHANGING BRANCHES OF THE TREES ON THE BANKS
UNCOUTH AS WAS HIS APPEARANCE HE HAD IN HIM THE RAW MATERIAL OF A POLITICIAN
THEIR SUSPENSION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS HAD BEEN LEGALIZED UP TO THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE NEXT SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE THEY WERE NOT NOW ABLE TO RESUME AND IT WAS HELD BY THE DEMOCRATS THAT IF THE SPECIAL SESSION ADJOURNED SINE DIE THE CHARTER OF THE BANKS WOULD BE FORFEITED A PURPOSE THE PARTY WAS EAGER TO ACCOMPLISH
WE CLAIM THAT THE COMPROMISE OF 1850 IS A FINAL SETTLEMENT
CASS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE
JOHN A
SHOULD THEY BE TAXED
WE WILL GIVE IT IN MR HAY'S WORDS
BUT LITTLE OVER THE MEDIUM HEIGHT THOUGH IN OTHER RESPECTS HE SEEMS TO HAVE RESEMBLED HIS SON IN APPEARANCE
NO ONE WAS LEFT EVEN TO ENTER A PROTEST
IT ARISES NATURALLY FROM THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS MORE CANDIDATES THAN PLACES THAT ANY ONE WHO IS A CANDIDATE TWICE IS FELT TO BE DEFRAUDING HIS NEIGHBORS AND THAT ALL CANDIDATES ARE TOO READY TO ASSURE THEIR CONSTITUENTS THAT THEY ONLY WANT ONE TERM AND TOO READY TO FORGET THESE ASSURANCES WHEN THEIR TERMS ARE ENDING
WILMOT OF PENNSYLVANIA
IT WAS THE CUSTOM AMONG FAMILIES WHEN THE LONGING FOR THE SIGHT OF KINDRED FACES WAS TOO STRONG TO WITHSTAND TO MOVE IN A BODY TO THE DISTANT SETTLEMENT WHERE THEIR RELATIVES LIVED AND REMAIN WITH THEM FOR MONTHS AT A TIME
I FANCIED FROM THE TIME I RECEIVED YOUR LETTER OF SATURDAY THAT THE ONE OF WEDNESDAY WAS NEVER TO COME AND YET IT DID COME AND WHAT IS MORE IT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR BOTH FROM ITS TONE AND HANDWRITING THAT
IT SEEMED LIKE A NATURAL SYMBOL OF SUPERIORITY
ALL HIS EFFORTS WERE DIRECTED TO MAKING SO STRONG A SHOW OF FORCE AS TO WARN HARDIN OFF THE FIELD
THE LAST LODGES OF THE POTTAWATOMIES HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE COUNTRY IN 1833
THE ADVICE OF A FATHER TO HIS SON BEWARE OF ENTRANCE TO A QUARREL BUT BEING IN BEAR IT THAT THE OPPOSED MAY BEWARE OF THEE IS GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST
BUT BEFORE A POPULAR AUDIENCE AND ON ALL OCCASIONS WHERE BRILLIANT AND EFFECTIVE IMPROVISATION WAS CALLED FOR HE WAS ALMOST UNEQUALED
THE NOMINATION OF MR POLK WAS RECEIVED WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM AND THE EXULTANT HOPES OF THE WHIGS WERE CORRESPONDINGLY INCREASED
LINCOLN HAD NEED LIKE HORATIO OF HIS GOOD SPIRITS FOR THEY WERE HIS ONLY OUTFIT FOR THE LONG JOURNEY TO NEW SALEM HE AND HIS MESS-MATE HARRISON FOOTNOTE
BUT LINCOLN AND HIS FRIENDS WENT ENERGETICALLY INTO THE CANVASS AND BEFORE IT CLOSED HE WAS ABLE TO FORESEE A CERTAIN VICTORY
BUT THAT DOES NOT AFFORD ME CONFIDENCE TO BEGIN THAT OR THE LIKE OF THAT AGAIN STILL HE WAS NEARING THE END OF HIS DOUBTS AND SELF-TORTURING SOPHISTRY
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT NOW ANOTHER SAYS I NEVER ENJOY MY BREAKFAST NOW AS I USED TO WHEN I GOT UP AND RAN DOWN A DEER BEFORE I COULD HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT BUT THEY SEE THE PAST THROUGH A ROSY MIST OF MEMORY TRANSFIGURED BY THE ETERNAL MAGIC OF YOUTH
THE STANDING OF THE OPPOSITION HAD BEEN GREATLY STRENGTHENED BY THE VERY VICTORIES UPON WHICH MR POLK HAD CONFIDENTLY RELIED FOR HIS VINDICATION
BAKER HAD LONG COVETED A SEAT IN CONGRESS AND WENT INTO THE CONTEST AGAINST LINCOLN WITH MANY POINTS IN HIS FAVOR
GRANT FAILED WITH SANTO DOMINGO
THE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS
197 BUT A YEAR OF BALEFUL EXPERIENCE DESTROYED A GREAT MANY ILLUSIONS AND IN THE ELECTION OF 1838 THE SUBJECT OF INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS WAS TREATED WITH MUCH MORE RESERVE BY CANDIDATES
DOUGLAS RECENTLY FROM VERMONT THE SHIFTY YOUNG LAWYER FROM MORGAN COUNTY WHO HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN HAVING HIMSELF MADE CIRCUIT ATTORNEY IN PLACE OF COLONEL HARDIN AND A MAN WHO WAS THEN REGARDED IN VANDALIA AS A FAR MORE IMPORTANT AND DANGEROUS PERSON THAN DOUGLAS EBENEZER PECK OF CHICAGO
IF LINCOLN HAD CARRIED SANGAMON COUNTY HIS STRENGTH WAS SO GREAT IN MENARD AND MASON WHERE HE WAS PERSONALLY KNOWN THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN EASILY NOMINATED
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT INTERIOR SPUR WHICH KEPT HIS CLEAR SPIRIT AT ITS TASK HIS SCHOOLS COULD HAVE DONE LITTLE FOR HIM
INDIAN AND EMIGRANT TRADERS DID NOT TOO CLOSELY SCAN THEIR SOURCES OF PROFIT
THIS MOCKERY OF AN ELECTION COMPLETED THE VALIANT KNIGHTS OF THE BLUE LODGE THE FRATERNAL MEMBERS OF THE SOCIAL BAND THE PHILANTHROPIC GROUPS OF THE FRIENDS SOCIETY AND THE CHIVALRIC SONS OF THE SOUTH RETURNED TO THEIR AXE AND PLOW SOCIETY LODGE AND BAR-ROOM HAUNT TO EXULT IN A VICTORY FOR MISSOURI AND SLAVERY OVER THE ABOLITION HORDES AND NIGGER THIEVES OF THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY THE BORDER RUFFIANS OF MISSOURI HAD WRITTEN THEIR PRELIMINARY CHAPTER IN THE ANNALS OF KANSAS
IF MR LINCOLN HAD NO OTHER CLAIMS TO BE REMEMBERED THAN HIS SERVICES IN THE LEGISLATURE OF 1836-7 THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO SAY IN HIS FAVOR
MR LINCOLN WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE BAR OF THAT CIRCUIT TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAVING BEEN WITHOUT OFFICIAL POSITION SINCE HE LEFT CONGRESS IN 1849
JEFFERSON DAVIS WHO WAS A MEMBER OF PRESIDENT PIERCE'S CABINET SECRETARY OF WAR THUS RELATES THE INCIDENT
AS IT WAS HE LOST MANY VOTES THROUGH A REPORT THAT HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF SAYING THAT HE WAS AS STRONG FOR JACKSON AS ANY REASONABLE MAN SHOULD BE THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF IN HIS NAIVE ACCOUNT OF THE CANVASS ACKNOWLEDGES THE DAMAGING NATURE OF THIS ACCUSATION AND COMFORTS HIMSELF WITH QUOTING AN INDISCRETION OF KINNEY'S WHO OPPOSED A PROJECTED CANAL ON THE GROUND THAT IT WOULD FLOOD THE COUNTRY WITH YANKEES IT SHOWED SOME MORAL COURAGE AND CERTAINLY AN ABSENCE OF THE SHUFFLING POLITICIAN'S FAIR-WEATHER POLICY THAT LINCOLN IN HIS OBSCURE AND PENNILESS YOUTH AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER WHEN HE WAS NOT EMBARRASSED BY ANTECEDENTS OR FAMILY CONNECTIONS AND WHEN IN FACT WHAT LITTLE SOCIAL INFLUENCE HE KNEW WOULD HAVE LED HIM THE OTHER WAY CHOSE TO OPPOSE A FURIOUSLY INTOLERANT MAJORITY AND TO TAKE HIS STAND WITH THE PARTY WHICH WAS DOOMED TO LONG-CONTINUED DEFEAT IN ILLINOIS
THE OCCASION WAS MADE MEMORABLE HOWEVER BY THE FACT THAT WHEN LINCOLN RETURNED HOME HE WROTE OUT AND PUBLISHED HIS SPEECH
HE WOULD SIT IN THE TWILIGHT AND READ A DICTIONARY AS LONG AS HE COULD SEE
SO ELABORATE AND SEARCHING A STUDY HOWEVER IS NOT NECESSARY TO THE PURPOSES OF THIS WORK
FIFTH WHETHER THE PEOPLE OF THAT SETTLEMENT OR A MAJORITY OF THEM OR ANY OF THEM HAVE EVER SUBMITTED THEMSELVES TO THE GOVERNMENT OR LAWS OF TEXAS OR OF THE UNITED STATES BY CONSENT OR BY COMPULSION EITHER BY ACCEPTING OFFICE OR VOTING AT ELECTIONS OR PAYING TAX OR SERVING ON JURIES OR HAVING PROCESS SERVED UPON THEM OR IN ANY OTHER WAY
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE ANNEXATION SOONER OR LATER WAS INEVITABLE
CHASE OF OHIO MADE A POLITICAL TOUR THROUGH THE STATE AND AT SPRINGFIELD THE FUTURE SECRETARY AND CHIEF-JUSTICE ADDRESSED AN UNSYMPATHETIC AUDIENCE OF A FEW HUNDREDS IN THE DINGY LITTLE COURT-HOUSE ALMOST UNHERALDED SAVE BY THE EPITHETS OF THE DEMOCRATIC NEWSPAPERS
MR SEWARD SPEAKING FOR TAYLOR AT CLEVELAND TOOK STILL STRONGER GROUND DECLARING THAT SLAVERY MUST BE ABOLISHED THAT FREEDOM AND SLAVERY ARE TWO ANTAGONISTIC ELEMENTS OF SOCIETY IN AMERICA THAT THE PARTY OF FREEDOM SEEKS COMPLETE AND UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION NO ONE THEN SEEMS TO HAVE FORESEEN THAT THE WHIG PARTY--THEN ON THE EVE OF A GREAT VICTORY--WAS SO NEAR ITS DISSOLUTION AND THAT THE BOLTING DEMOCRATS AND THE FAITHFUL WHIGS WERE ALIKE ENGAGED IN LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS OF A PARTY WHICH WAS TO GLORIFY THE LATTER HALF OF THE CENTURY WITH ACHIEVEMENTS OF SUCH COLOSSAL AND ENDURING IMPORTANCE
THEY NUMBERED MEN ENOUGH TO BUILD WITHOUT CALLING IN THEIR NEIGHBORS AND IMMEDIATELY PUT UP A CABIN ON THE NORTH FORK OF THE SANGAMON RIVER
THE ADJOINING COUNTY OF MORGAN WAS WARMLY DEVOTED TO ONE OF ITS OWN CITIZENS JOHN J
HE WEIGHED AT THAT TIME LITTLE IF ANYTHING OVER A HUNDRED POUNDS YET HIS HEART WAS SO VALIANT THAT HE MADE NOTHING OF ASSAULTING MEN OF PONDEROUS FLESH LIKE FRANCIS OR OF GREAT HEIGHT AND STRENGTH LIKE STUART
IF I ATTEMPT IT THE JURY WILL SEE I THINK HE IS GUILTY AND CONVICT HIM ONCE HE WAS PROSECUTING A CIVIL SUIT IN THE COURSE OF WHICH EVIDENCE WAS INTRODUCED SHOWING THAT HIS CLIENT WAS ATTEMPTING A FRAUD
LINCOLN WAS AT THE HEAD OF THE PROJECT TO REMOVE THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT TO SPRINGFIELD
THE WHIGS WHO WERE DEFENDING THE BANKS WISHED TO PREVENT THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL SESSION UNTIL THE REGULAR SESSION SHOULD BEGIN DURING THE COURSE OF WHICH THEY EXPECTED TO RENEW THE LEASE OF LIFE NOW HELD UNDER SUFFERANCE BY THE BANKS--IN WHICH IT MAY BE HERE SAID THEY WERE FINALLY SUCCESSFUL
KING CHOSEN WITH PRESIDENT PIERCE HAD DIED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE AUGUST ADJOURNMENT OF CONGRESS HURRIED AWAY TO HIS HOME IN PLATTE COUNTY MISSOURI AND FROM THAT FAVORABLE SITUATION PERSONALLY ORGANIZED A VAST CONSPIRACY RUNNING THROUGH NEARLY ALL THE COUNTIES OF HIS STATE ADJOINING THE KANSAS BORDER TO DECIDE THE SLAVERY QUESTION FOR KANSAS BY MISSOURI VOTES
BUT THE CATALOGUE OF HIS CRIMES EMBRACES NOTHING LESS VENIAL THAN CARD-PLAYING HORSE-RACING AND DANCING AND IT IS HARD TO SEE WHAT DIFFERENT AMUSEMENTS COULD HAVE BEEN FOUND IN SOUTHERN KENTUCKY IN 1801
THERE WAS A FRUITLESS EFFORT AT COMPROMISE WHICH TO LOVEJOY MEANT MERELY SURRENDER AND WHICH HE FIRMLY REJECTED
J.G
THIS COMMITTEE WITH A FEARLESS DILIGENCE COLLECTED IN THE TERRITORY AS WELL AS FROM THE BORDER COUNTIES OF MISSOURI A MASS OF SWORN TESTIMONY AMOUNTING TO SOME 1200 PRINTED PAGES AND WHICH EXPOSED THE BORDER RUFFIAN INVASIONS AND THE MISSOURI USURPATION IN ALL THEIR MONSTROUS INIQUITY AND OFFICIALLY REVEALED TO THE ASTOUNDED NORTH FOR THE FIRST TIME AND NEARLY TWO YEARS AFTER ITS BEGINNING THE FULL PROPORTIONS OF THE CONSPIRACY WHICH HELD SWAY IN KANSAS CHAPTER XXV CIVIL WAR IN KANSAS OUT OF THE ANTAGONISTIC AND CONTENDING FACTIONS MENTIONED IN THE LAST TWO CHAPTERS THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE AND ITS BORDER-RUFFIAN ADHERENTS ON THE ONE HAND AND THE FRAMERS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE TOPEKA CONSTITUTION ON THE OTHER GREW THE CIVIL WAR IN KANSAS
IN FRONTIER LIFE IT WAS AN EVERY-DAY EXPERIENCE TO MAKE EXCURSIONS FOR BUSINESS OR PLEASURE SINGLY OR IN PARTIES REQUIRING TWO OR THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS PERHAPS A NIGHT OR TWO OF CAMPING OUT FOR WHICH SADDLE-HORSES AND FARM-WAGONS FURNISHED READY TRANSPORTATION
WE WILL REMEMBER YOU HENRY CLAY WHILE THE MEMORY OF THE GLORIOUS OR THE SENSE OF THE GOOD REMAINS IN US WITH A GRATEFUL AND ADMIRING AFFECTION WHICH SHALL STRENGTHEN WITH OUR STRENGTH AND SHALL NOT DECAY WITH OUR DECLINE
KEPT HIMSELF NON-COMMITAL ON NEBRASKA AND OPPOSED DOUGLAS'S SCHEME OF TONNAGE DUTIES TO IMPROVE WESTERN RIVERS AND HARBORS
JUDGE DOUGLAS REQUESTED TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TO CONSIDER THE MATTER AND IF AT THE EXPIRATION OF THAT TIME HE COULD NOT INTRODUCE SUCH A BILL AS HE MR ATCHISON PROPOSED HE WOULD RESIGN AS CHAIRMAN OF THE TERRITORIAL COMMITTEE IN DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS AND EXERT HIS INFLUENCE TO GET HIM ATCHISON APPOINTED
HERE WE HAVE THE SHADOW OF THE COMING DRED SCOTT DECISION ALREADY PROJECTED INTO POLITICAL HISTORY THOUGH THE SPEAKER PROTESTS THAT NONE OF US KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF A CONTROVERSY THEN PENDING IN THE FEDERAL COURTS THAT WOULD LEAD ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO THE DECISION OF THAT QUESTION THIS WAS PROBABLY TRUE
A LEGISLATOR WAS AS LIKELY TO SUFFER FOR DOING RIGHT AS FOR DOING WRONG
ONLY ONCE SINCE THEN HAS NATURE SHOWN SUCH EXTRAVAGANT SEVERITY IN ILLINOIS AND THAT WAS ON A DAY IN THE WINTER OF 1836 KNOWN TO ILLINOISANS AS THE SUDDEN CHANGE AT NOON ON THE 20TH OF DECEMBER AFTER A WARM AND RAINY MORNING THE GROUND BEING COVERED WITH MUD AND SLUSH THE TEMPERATURE FELL INSTANTLY FORTY DEGREES

BOONE WAS A DEPUTY OF COLONEL THOMAS MARSHALL SURVEYOR OF FAYETTE COUNTY RELOCATED FOOTNOTE 1
IN DECEMBER 1778 JOHN TODD WAS APPOINTED BY PATRICK HENRY GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA TO BE LIEUTENANT OF THE COUNTY OF ILLINOIS THEN A PART OF VIRGINIA
HIS PERSONAL CONVICTIONS HIS PARTY FAITH HIS SENATORIAL REFLECTION AND HIS FINANCIAL FORTUNES WERE ALL INVOLVED IN THE SCHEME
933-985 ARRIVING AT LEAVENWORTH IN OCTOBER 1854 GOVERNOR REEDER WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING THE DESIGNS OF THE MISSOURIANS
THE ERECTION OF THE SOCIETY HOTEL THE SOCIETY SAW-MILLS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEWSPAPER ALSO GAVE IT LEADERSHIP IN BUSINESS AND POLITICS AS WELL AS POPULATION
THIS LARGE VOTE WAS ALL THE MORE NOTEWORTHY BECAUSE THE WHIGS WERE THIS YEAR UPON THE UNPOPULAR SIDE
THIS TACIT COMPROMISE HOWEVER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT VICTORY OF THE SAME POLICY
I SUPPOSE MY OPPOSITION TO THE PRINCIPLE OF SLAVERY IS AS STRONG AS THAT OF ANY MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
CHAPTER IV NEW SALEM DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE WINTER OF THE DEEP SNOW LINCOLN BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH ONE DENTON OFFUTT AN ADVENTUROUS AND DISCURSIVE SORT OF MERCHANT WITH MORE IRONS IN THE FIRE THAN HE COULD WELL MANAGE
HE HAD BEGUN HIS PRACTICE IN THAT DIRECTION BEFORE LEAVING INDIANA AND CONTINUED IT EVERYWHERE HE HAD GONE
HARDIN AND ONE DR ENGLISH AND THE MACHINE A CANOE IN WHICH THEY HAD HASTILY PADDLED ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI
YESTERDAY DOUGLAS HAVING CHOSEN TO CONSIDER HIMSELF INSULTED BY SOMETHING IN THE JOURNAL UNDERTOOK TO CANE FRANCIS IN THE STREET
AND THE COMBATANTS WERE TO STAND ON EITHER SIDE OF A BOARD PLACED ON THE GROUND EACH TO FIGHT IN A LIMIT OF SIX FEET ON HIS OWN SIDE OF THE BOARD
HE SEIZED THE STRONG POINTS OF A CAUSE AND PRESENTED THEM WITH CLEARNESS AND GREAT COMPACTNESS
SHOULD EACH COUNTY IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI ONLY DO ITS DUTY THE QUESTION WILL BE DECIDED QUIETLY AND PEACEABLY AT THE BALLOT-BOX
HE WAS POOR AND HAD SCARCELY EVER BEEN AT SCHOOL YET HE WAS THE BEST-INFORMED YOUNG MAN IN THE VILLAGE
SURVEYOR'S NOTICE.--I HAVE APPOINTED JOHN B
THE WHOLE-HOG PARTY HAD ONE NEWSPAPER THE OPPOSITION FIVE
HE CAME FROM CANADA WHERE HE HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE PROVINCIAL PARLIAMENT
TO THESE AN URGENT APPEAL FOR HELP WAS MADE
THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY EVEN WHERE ITS PRESENCE WAS NOT AVOWED HAD ITS SECRET INFLUENCE UPON EVERY TRIAL OF STRENGTH IN CONGRESS AND SOUTHERN WHIGS WERE CONTINUALLY FOUND SUSTAINING THE PRESIDENT AND NEW ENGLAND DEMOCRATS VOTING AGAINST HIS MOST CHERISHED PLANS
ITS METHODICAL ANALYSIS AND POWERFUL PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE MADE IT ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR AND CONVINCING DOCUMENTS EVER ISSUED OF OHIO AND MORDECAI OLIVER OF MISSOURI WHICH BY THE EXAMINATION OF NUMEROUS WITNESSES WAS PROBING THE BORDER-RUFFIAN INVASIONS THE ILLEGALITY OF THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE AND THE ENORMITY OF THE BOGUS LAWS TO THE BOTTOM
PLAINS AND MOUNTAINS WERE SWARMING WITH ADVENTURERS AND EMIGRANTS
HER GREAT-UNCLE JOHN TODD AND HER GRANDFATHER LEVI TODD ACCOMPANIED GENERAL GEORGE ROGERS CLARK TO ILLINOIS AND WERE PRESENT AT THE CAPTURE OF KASKASKIA AND VINCENNES
HIS REASON FRANKLY GIVEN WAS THAT HE HAD LOST AN OFFICE IN NEW YORK BY OPPOSING THE WAR OF 1812
AND WHETHER THAT LAW WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OR NOT IT WOULD DO ITS WORK AND THAT WORK WOULD BE TO PRECLUDE SLAVEHOLDERS FROM GOING INTO THAT TERRITORY
THE EXTREME LENGTH OF ILLINOIS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH IS 385 MILES
THERE WAS NO NEED OF THAT CLOSE AND SEARCHING STUDY INTO PRINCIPLES AND PRECEDENTS WHICH KEEPS THE MODERN LAW-STUDENT BURIED IN HIS OFFICE
THE FIRST OF THESE GREAT LANDMARKS WAS THE ORDINANCE OF 1787
WHEN HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT I QUESTION WHETHER THERE WAS A LAWYER IN THE CIRCUIT WHO HAD BEEN AT THE BAR SO LONG A TIME WHOSE MEANS WERE NOT LARGER
BUT AN OPENING FOR ANOTHER KIND OF BUSINESS OCCURRED WHICH PREVENTED HIS ENTERING UPON ANY MERELY MECHANICAL OCCUPATION
WEBSTER INSISTED UPON IT THAT THE WHIGS WERE THEMSELVES THE BEST FREE-SOILERS AND FOR THEM TO JOIN THE PARTY CALLED BY THAT DISTINCTIVE NAME WOULD BE MERELY PUTTING MR VAN BUREN AT THE HEAD OF THE WHIG PARTY
THEY GAVE THE SEAT TO HANSEN AND WITH HIS VOTE ELECTED THOMAS
ON THE CONTRARY THE VERY CHARACTER OF THIS SIMPLE LITIGATION DREW THE LAWYER INTO THE STREET AND NEIGHBORHOOD AND INTO CLOSE AND ACTIVE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL CLASSES OF HIS FELLOW-MEN
YOU DO NOT VERY MUCH DISLIKE TO WORK AND STILL YOU DO NOT WORK MUCH MERELY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SEEM TO YOU THAT YOU COULD GET MUCH FOR IT
MORDECAI THE ELDEST SON RAN INSTINCTIVELY TO THE HOUSE JOSIAH TO THE NEIGHBORING FORT FOR ASSISTANCE AND THOMAS THE YOUNGEST A CHILD OF SIX WAS LEFT WITH THE CORPSE OF HIS FATHER
AND IF HE COULD GET THAT POSITION HE WOULD IMMEDIATELY RESIGN AS PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE
THE GOVERNOR EDWARD COLES OF VIRGINIA A STRONG ANTISLAVERY MAN HAD BEEN ELECTED BY A DIVISION OF THE PRO SLAVERY PARTY BUT CAME IN WITH A LEGISLATURE LARGELY AGAINST HIM
I DO NOT THINK I WAS
THE SCHEMES OF THE SOUTHERN STATESMEN WHO WERE WORKING FOR THE EXTENSION OF SLAVERY WERE NOT DEFENSIBLE AND WE HAVE NO DISPOSITION TO DEFEND THEM
LINCOLN REAPPEARS IN POLITICS
THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH HE CONFRONTED THIS CRISIS WAS STRANGELY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF MOST MEN IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES NEED SURELY OCCASION NO SURPRISE
THE ALLEGED DOINGS OF THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETIES FURNISHED A CONVENIENT AND PLAUSIBLE PRETEXT
EACH BOSOM FILLED WITH MARTIAL FLAME AND KINDLING FOR THE FIGHT
INDIANA IN 1816 FREE
A PARTY OF GEORGIA GENTLEMEN FROM THE INTERIOR MAKING A VISIT TO THIS FAMILY FELL INTO CONVERSATION ON THE PROSPECTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF COTTON CULTURE AND THE IMPERATIVE NEED OF A RAPIDLY WORKING CLEANING-MACHINE
HE HAD THE SAME DISADVANTAGES THAT THEY HAD
BUT NEVERTHELESS THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO FELT THAT THE TIME HAD COME TO PUT A STOP TO THE AGGRESSION OF SLAVERY GENERALLY THREW OFF THEIR PARTISAN ALLEGIANCE AND THE MOST ARDENT OF THE ANTISLAVERY WHIGS,--WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS IT IS TRUE ESPECIALLY IN OHIO AND IN MASSACHUSETTS WHERE THE STRENGTH OF THE CONSCIENCE WHIGS LED BY SUMNER THE ADAMSES AND HENRY WILSON WAS IMPORTANT,--THOUGHT BEST TO REMAIN WITH THEIR PARTY
SLAVERY WAS THUS IDENTIFIED WITH THE WHOLE HISTORY AND ALSO WITH THE APPARENT PROSPERITY OF THE STATE

LYMAN TRUMBULL PROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY BRADY
HIS AXE WAS AS PRECIOUS TO THE PIONEER AS HIS SWORD TO THE KNIGHT ERRANT
BUT AS A CLASS THEY NEVER GAVE UP OR CONQUERED THEIR INTENSE HATRED OF ANTISLAVERY CONVICTIONS BASED ON MERELY MORAL GROUNDS WHICH THEY INDISCRIMINATELY STIGMATIZED AS ABOLITIONISM IMPELLED BY THIS HATRED THE LAWLESS ELEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY WAS OFTEN GUILTY OF PERSECUTION AND VIOLENCE IN MINOR FORMS AND IN 1837 AS ALREADY RELATED IT PROMPTED THE MURDER OF LOVEJOY IN THE CITY OF ALTON BY A MOB FOR PERSISTING IN HIS RIGHT TO PUBLISH HIS ANTISLAVERY OPINIONS
14 THIS THEN WAS THE PERFECT FLOWER OF DOUGLAS'S VAUNTED EXPERIMENT OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY"--A RESULT THEY PROFESSED FULLY TO APPRECIATE
THE WHOLE STATE WAS EXCITED TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF FRENZY AND EXPECTATION
MORDECAI REACHING THE CABIN SEIZED THE RIFLE AND SAW THROUGH THE LOOPHOLE AN INDIAN IN HIS WAR-PAINT STOOPING TO RAISE THE CHILD FROM THE GROUND
LINCOLN WHILE HE DID NOT BECOME RICH ALWAYS EARNED A RESPECTABLE LIVELIHOOD AND NEVER KNEW THE CARE OF POVERTY OR DEBT FROM THAT TIME FORWARD HIS WIFE AND HE SUITED THEIR STYLE OF LIVING TO THEIR MEANS AND WERE EQUALLY REMOVED FROM LUXURY AND PRIVATION
SUCH FURNACE-BLASTS OF PROOF SUCH PANGS OF TRANSFORMATION SEEM NECESSARY FOR EXCEPTIONAL NATURES
WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOUR CASE LINCOLN ASKED
IN 1841 YOU AND I HAD TOGETHER A TEDIOUS LOW-WATER TRIP ON A STEAMBOAT FROM LOUISVILLE TO ST LOUIS
FORTUNE FAVORED THE LATTER ONCE MORE FOR WHILE BLACK HAWK WITH A HANDFUL OF MEN WAS ENGAGING AND DRAWING AWAY THE FORCE UNDER ATKINSON GENERAL HENRY STRUCK THE MAIN TRAIL AND BROUGHT ON THE BATTLE OF THE BAD AXE IF THAT COULD BE CALLED A BATTLE WHICH WAS AN EASY SLAUGHTER OF THE WEARY AND DISCOURAGED SAVAGES FIGHTING WITHOUT HEART OR HOPE AN ARMY IN FRONT AND THE GREAT RIVER BEHIND
LINCOLN FOR MAKING PLOT AND REPORT $2.50 ON MAP WHOLE LENGTH OF ROAD 26 MILES AND 70 CHAINS
THE CRUST OF THE SNOW WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR THE WEIGHT OF MEN AND DOGS BUT THE SLENDER HOOFS OF THE DEER WOULD AFTER A FEW BOUNDS PIERCE THE TREACHEROUS SURFACE
THE FAME OF THIS SUCCESS BROUGHT LINCOLN URGENT CALLS FROM ALL THE PLACES WHERE DOUGLAS WAS EXPECTED TO SPEAK

AND THAT ANY PARTY MAKING OR ATTEMPTING TO MAKE ANY OTHER IS AND SHOULD BE HELD AS AN ALLY OF ABOLITIONISM AND DISUNION HAD THE CONSPIRACY BEEN CONTENT TO PROSECUTE ITS DESIGNS THROUGH MODERATE MEASURES IT WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE FASTENED SLAVERY UPON KANSAS

ONCE AN INTERRUPTION OCCURRED WHICH AFFORDS AN ODD ILLUSTRATION OF THE CHARACTER OF DISCUSSION THEN PREVALENT
YET THESE WERE OF THE SIMPLEST CHARACTER AND TOTALLY DEVOID OF ANY ADVENTITIOUS ACCESSORIES
IN THE SHOOTING OF SHERIFF JONES IN LAWRENCE AND IN THE REFUSAL OF EX-GOVERNOR BEEDER TO ALLOW THE DEPUTY-MARSHAL TO ARREST HIM THEY DISCOVERED GRAVE OFFENSES AGAINST THE TERRITORIAL AND UNITED STATES LAWS
THEY HAD BOTH EVADED ANY PROFESSION OF FAITH IN REGARD TO SLAVERY

AN APOCRYPHAL STORY OF ONE OF THESE VISITS WAS OFTEN TOLD OF HIM WHICH PLEASED HIM SO THAT HE NEVER CONTRADICTED IT
GONE TO H WAS THE GLOOMY RESPONSE
BUT THEY LEFT OUT OF VIEW THE VALUE OF THE MORAL FORCES CALLED INTO BEING BY THEIR INSOLENT CHALLENGE
HIS CHIEF PREOCCUPATION DURING THIS SECOND SESSION WAS A SCHEME WHICH LINKS ITSELF CHARACTERISTICALLY WITH HIS FIRST PROTEST AGAINST THE PROSCRIPTIVE SPIRIT OF SLAVERY TEN YEARS BEFORE IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE AND HIS IMMORTAL ACT FIFTEEN YEARS AFTERWARDS IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH AMERICAN SLAVERY CEASED TO EXIST
IT TOOK LITTLE TIME FOR THIS ENERGETIC AND HONEST CHRISTIAN WOMAN TO MAKE HER INFLUENCE FELT EVEN IN THOSE DISCOURAGING SURROUNDINGS AND THOMAS LINCOLN AND THE CHILDREN WERE THE BETTER FOR HER COMING ALL THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
THE OFFICIAL RESOLUTION WHICH THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE PROCLAIMED AS A FINAL POLITICAL TEST LEFT NO MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN THOSE WHO WERE FOR SLAVERY AND THOSE WHO WERE AGAINST SLAVERY--THOSE WHO WERE FOR THE BOGUS LAWS IN ALL THEIR ENORMITY AND THOSE WHO WERE AGAINST THEM--AND ALL WHO WERE NOT WILLING TO BECOME ACTIVE CO-WORKERS WITH THE CONSPIRACY WERE FORCED TO COMBINE IN SELF-DEFENSE
KENTUCKY IN 1780
I MUST DIE OR BE BETTER IT APPEARS TO ME
BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE HE DESIRES THE NOMINATION
IT IS STILL A GREAT DAY FOR BURNING FIRE-CRACKERS
THIS SEEMED SATISFACTORY TO THE PEOPLE AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO FISH OUT HIS PRESS BUY NEW TYPES AND SET UP HIS PAPER
AND THE OTHER WAS A LAW TO PREVENT BULLS OF INFERIOR SIZE AND BREED FROM RUNNING AT LARGE
THE GOVERNOR WAS DENOUNCED AS A TRAITOR AND SHERIFF JONES DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE WIPED OUT LAWRENCE ATCHISON ON THE CONTRARY SUSTAINED THE BARGAIN EXPLAINING THAT TO ATTACK LAWRENCE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD RUIN THE DEMOCRATIC CAUSE
ITS INTERFERENCE IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION SERVED AS A PRACTICAL EXPERIMENT TO DEMONSTRATE ITS EFFICIENCY AND TO PERFECT ITS PLANS
THESE AGAIN WERE HEIGHTENED BY TWO SPECIAL INFLUENCES--THE PRESENCE OF INDIAN TRIBES WHOSE RESERVATIONS LAY JUST ACROSS THE BORDER AND THE ADVENT AND PREPARATION OF EACH SUMMER'S EMIGRATION ACROSS THE GREAT PLAINS
AND GOVERNOR EDWARD COLES WHO HAD BEEN PRIVATE SECRETARY TO MADISON AND WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE COURTS OF EUROPE A MAN AS NOTABLE FOR HIS GENTLENESS OF MANNERS AS FOR HIS NOBILITY OF NATURE COULD NEVER HAVE COME SO READILY AND EASILY TO THE HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT AFTER THE MACHINE OF THE CAUCUS HAD BEEN PERFECTED
IN MANY CASES THE CITY WAS PLOTTED THE SITES OF THE PRINCIPAL BUILDINGS INCLUDING A COURTHOUSE AND A UNIVERSITY WERE DETERMINED AND A SONOROUS NAME WAS SELECTED OUT OF PLUTARCH BEFORE ITS LOCATION WAS EVEN CONSIDERED
AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT FORCES SO MANY REALLY GOOD MEN AMONG OURSELVES INTO AN OPEN WAR WITH THE VERY FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL LIBERTY CRITICIZING THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND INSISTING THAT THERE IS NO RIGHT PRINCIPLE OF ACTION BUT SELF INTEREST
LINCOLN AN APPLICANT FOR OFFICE

HE HAD THAT LOVE FOR HIS PROFESSION WHICH IT JEALOUSLY EXACTS AS A CONDITION OF SUCCEEDING
AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF DESULTORY INSTRUCTION YOUNG ABRAHAM KNEW ALL THAT THESE VAGRANT LITERATI COULD TEACH HIM
AS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON TERRITORIES IN THE SENATE HE HAD BORNE A PROMINENT PART IN THE ENACTMENT OF THE COMPROMISE MEASURES OF 1850 AND HAD JUST MET AND OVERCOME A THREATENED PARTY SCHISM IN HIS OWN STATE WHICH THAT LEGISLATION HAD THERE PRODUCED
PETTY COMMERCE BUSIES ITSELF WITH THE ART OF GAIN RATHER THAN WITH THE LABOR OF REFORM
HE MET THESE MANOEUVRES SUFFICIENTLY WELL WHEN PRACTICED BY OTHERS BUT HE NEVER COULD GET IN THE WAY OF HANDLING THEM FOR HIMSELF
AND TO THE END THAT ALL OBJECTIONS SHOULD BE STIFLED ON THE PART OF THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH HAD NEITHER RAILROADS NOR RIVERS A GIFT OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS VOTED TO THEM AND WITH THIS SOP THEY WERE FAIN TO BE CONTENT AND NOT TROUBLE THE GENERAL JOY
HIS TREATMENT OF HIS THEME WAS THEREFORE NOT ONLY BOLD BUT ORIGINAL
A LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED IN THE STREET CANNON WERE PLANTED AND THE MACHINERY OF WAR PREPARED FOR INSTANT ACTION
THE PROSPECTS OF THE BILL WERE SEEN TO BE HOPELESS AS THE SESSION WAS TO END ON THE 4TH OF MARCH AND NO FURTHER EFFORT WAS MADE TO CARRY IT THROUGH

IT WAS ONE OF THE ARTICLES OF FAITH OF MOST OF THE SETTLERS ON THE BANKS OF THE SANGAMON RIVER THAT IT WAS A NAVIGABLE STREAM AND THE LOCAL POLITICIANS FOUND THAT THEY COULD IN NO WAY MORE EASILY HIT THE FANCY OF THEIR HEARERS THAN BY DISCUSSING THIS ASSUMED FACT AND THE LOGICAL COROLLARY DERIVED FROM IT THAT IT WAS THE DUTY OF THE STATE OR THE NATION TO CLEAR OUT THE SNAGS AND GIVE FREE COURSE TO THE COMMERCE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO POUR ALONG THIS NATURAL HIGHWAY
WHEN HE HAD DRAWN UP HIS PLAN HE TOOK COUNSEL WITH SOME OF THE LEADING CITIZENS OF WASHINGTON AND SOME OF THE MORE PROMINENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEFORE BRINGING IT FORWARD
HE HAD ALREADY SELECTED A PIECE OF GROUND FOR THEM A FEW MILES FROM HIS OWN AND HAD THE LOGS READY FOR THEIR HOUSE
MARRIAGE OF THOMAS LINCOLN
IT WAS JUST AT THAT MOMENT IN THE IMPENDING REVOLUTION OF PARTIES WHEN EVERYTHING WAS DOUBT DISTRUST UNCERTAINTY
THERE IS NO QUESTION OF THE PROPRIETY OF REMOVING THE POSTMASTER AT CARLINVILLE I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SO MANY DIFFERENT PERSONS AS TO PRECLUDE ALL DOUBT OF ITS TRUTH THAT HE BOLDLY REFUSED TO DELIVER FROM HIS OFFICE DURING THE CANVASS ALL DOCUMENTS FRANKED BY WHIG MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ONCE MORE ON THE 23D OF JANUARY 1841 HE ADDRESSES A LETTER TO MR STUART WHICH CLOSES THE CORRESPONDENCE AND WHICH AFFORDS A GLIMPSE OF THAT STRANGE CONDITION OF MELANCHOLIA INTO WHOSE DARK SHADOW HE WAS THEN ENTERING AND WHICH LASTED WITH ONLY OCCASIONAL INTERVALS OF HEALTHY CHEERFULNESS TO THE TIME OF HIS MARRIAGE
SEVERAL OTHER OFFICERS DID THE SAME AMONG THEM GENERAL WHITESIDES AND MAJOR JOHN T
THE THIRD DAY OUT THEY CAME TO THE HENDERSON RIVER A STREAM SOME FIFTY YARDS WIDE SWIFT AND SWOLLEN WITH THE SPRING THAWS WITH HIGH AND STEEP BANKS
IN A TECHNICAL SENSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SLAVERY IN KANSAS WAS COMPLETE
SEIZING THIS OPPORTUNITY IT WAS THEIR PRESENT PURPOSE TO ESTABLISH A SLAVE CONFEDERACY CONSISTING OF THE COTTON STATES WHICH SHOULD IN DUE TIME DRAW TO ITSELF BY AN IRRESISTIBLE GRAVITATION OF SYMPATHY AND INTEREST FIRST THE BORDER SLAVE STATES AND IN THE FURTHER PROGRESS OF EVENTS THE TROPICAL COUNTRIES TOWARDS THE EQUATOR
HANSEN WOULD VOTE FOR THEIR SENATOR AND NOT FOR THE CONVENTION
IT IS A MEASURE NOT ASKED FOR OR WISHED FOR BY THE PEOPLE
IT WAS NO MERE CHANCE THAT RAISED THE VERMONT CABINET-MAKER'S APPRENTICE FROM A PENNILESS STRANGER IN ILLINOIS IN 1833 TO A FORMIDABLE COMPETITOR FOR SUPREME LEADERSHIP IN THE GREAT DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF THE NATION IN 1852

THE LINCOLN-STONE PROTEST THE PRO-SLAVERY SENTIMENT IN ILLINOIS
TO ENLIGHTEN YOU AND THE REST OF THE WORLD I SHALL SEND YOU A COPY WHEN IT IS FINISHED THE BIG SPEECH WAS THE ONE FROM WHICH WE HAVE JUST QUOTED
THE SAME HATRED OF SLAVERY THE SAME SYMPATHY WITH THE SLAVE THE SAME CONSIDERATION FOR THE SLAVEHOLDER AS THE VICTIM OF A SYSTEM HE HAD INHERITED THE SAME SENSE OF DIVIDED RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH THE SAME DESIRE TO EFFECT GREAT REFORMS WITH AS LITTLE INDIVIDUAL DAMAGE AND INJURY AS LITTLE DISTURBANCE OF SOCIAL CONDITIONS AS POSSIBLE WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT WHEN THE RAW PIONEER SIGNED THE PROTEST WITH DAN STONE AT VANDALIA WHEN THE MATURE MAN MOVED THE RESOLUTION OF 1849 IN THE CAPITOL AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT GAVE THE SANCTION OF HIS BOLD SIGNATURE TO THE ACT WHICH SWEPT AWAY THE SLAVE-SHAMBLES FROM THE CITY OF WASHINGTON
BUT FROM THIS TIME FORWARD HIS ASSOCIATIONS WERE WITH A BETTER CLASS OF MEN THAN HE HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE AND A NEW FEELING OF SELF-RESPECT MUST NATURALLY HAVE GROWN UP IN HIS MIND FROM HIS CONSTANT INTERCOURSE WITH THEM--A FEELING WHICH EXTENDED TO THE MINOR MORALS OF CIVILIZED LIFE
WE WERE THE DAILY AND NIGHTLY WITNESSES OF THE INCIDENTS THE ANXIETIES THE FEARS AND THE HOPES WHICH PERVADED THE EXECUTIVE MANSION AND THE NATIONAL CAPITAL

HE CERTAINLY GOT NO OTHER REWARD FOR HIS TROUBLE
THE PIONEERS PLANTED THEIR NEW HOMES AS NEARLY AS MIGHT BE IN A CLIMATE LIKE THE ONE THEY HAD LEFT

HE ADMIRED ABRAHAM BEYOND MEASURE AND PRAISED HIM BEYOND PRUDENCE

AND ESPECIALLY THE FAMILIAR VOICE AND EXAMPLE OF THE NEIGHBORING MISSOURI WHIGS WERE GIVEN UNHESITATINGLY TO THE SUPPORT OF THE DOUGLAS SCHEME
IT IS TO BE PRESUMED THAT HIS FITNESS IN A PARTISAN LIGHT HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY SCRUTINIZED BY BOTH PRESIDENT AND SENATE
I WAS MUCH VERY MUCH WOUNDED MYSELF AT HIS BEING LEFT OUT
FROM 1849 TO 1854 BOTH INCLUSIVE I PRACTICED LAW MORE ASSIDUOUSLY THAN EVER BEFORE
WHEN HIS TASKS ENDED HIS STUDIES BECAME THE CHIEF PLEASURE OF HIS LIFE
THE WINTER WAS MOSTLY DEVOTED TO SPEECHES UPON THE SAME SUBJECT FROM MEN OF EMINENCE AND EXPERIENCE BUT IT IS WITHIN BOUNDS TO SAY THERE WAS NOT A SPEECH MADE IN THE HOUSE THAT YEAR SUPERIOR TO THIS IN CLEARNESS OF STATEMENT SEVERITY OF CRITICISM COMBINED WITH SOBERNESS OF STYLE OR WHAT IS MOST SURPRISING FINISH AND CORRECTNESS
THEY HAD BROKEN UP INTO SMALL PARTIES AND FOR SEVERAL DAYS THEY REAPED THE BLOODY FRUIT OF THEIR VICTORY IN THE MASSACRE OF PEACEFUL SETTLEMENTS IN THE ADJACENT DISTRICTS
THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES CONSIDERED THE WESTERN BOUNDARY OF TEXAS TO BE THE NUECES RIVER FROM MOUTH TO SOURCE

AND THE WAR OF FACTIONS BEGUN IN JANUARY RAGED WITH INCREASING BITTERNESS TILL THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION MET AT BALTIMORE IN JUNE AND UNDOUBTEDLY EXERTED A DECISIVE INFLUENCE OVER THE DELIBERATIONS OF THAT BODY

WHAT EFFECT WOULD IT HAVE UPON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1856
THE DOCTRINE OF SELF-GOVERNMENT IS RIGHT,--ABSOLUTELY AND ETERNALLY RIGHT,--BUT IT HAS NO JUST APPLICATION AS HERE ATTEMPTED

AND THIS EXPERIENCE HAS DEMONSTRATED I THINK THAT THERE IS NO PEACEFUL EXTINCTION OF SLAVERY IN PROSPECT FOR US
LETTERS FROM THOMAS GREGG AND OTHERS THE SPY BATTALION FORMED NO PART OF GENERAL HENRY'S FORCES WHEN BY A DISOBEDIENCE OF ORDERS AS PRUDENT AS IT WAS AUDACIOUS HE STARTED WITH HIS SLENDER FORCE ON THE FRESH TRAIL WHICH HE WAS SURE WOULD LEAD HIM TO BLACK HAWK'S CAMP
IT IS DUE TO THE SOUTH
WHOEVER THEREFORE CHOOSES TO TRACE THE REMOTE ORIGIN OF THE AMERICAN REBELLION WILL FIND THE GERM OF THE UNION ARMIES OF 1861-5 IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER AND THE INCEPTION OF THE SECESSION FORCES BETWEEN THE DECKS OF THAT DUTCH SLAVER WHICH PLANTED THE FRUITS OF HER AVARICE AND PIRACY IN THE JAMES RIVER COLONIES IN 1619
THE SAME THING HAPPENED AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN HE WAS ENGAGED WITH JUDGE S
LINCOLN REPLIED TO HIM ON THE FOLLOWING DAY OCTOBER 4
IN THIS CRITICAL MOMENT LINCOLN EXHIBITED A GENEROSITY AND A SAGACITY ABOVE THE RANGE OF THE MERE POLITICIAN'S VISION

ALL THE STATES TOLERATED SLAVERY AND PERMITTED THE SLAVE-TRADE DURING THE REVOLUTION
THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE DISPOSITION ON THE PART OF BOTH PARTIES IN THE LEGISLATURE TO REINSTATE THE LAW BRINGING ON THE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS NEXT SUMMER
BONDS WERE SOLD FOR THIS PURPOSE AT A HEAVY LOSS
OLIVER JOHNSON ATTACKED THE NATIONAL SIN AND WRONG IN THE STANDARD WITH ZEAL AND ENERGY EQUALLY HOT AND UNTIRING
A LARGE SQUARE HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOWN IN ANTICIPATION OF FUTURE GREATNESS AND THERE WHEN LINCOLN BEGAN HIS RESIDENCE THE WORK OF CLEARING THE GROUND FOR THE NEW STATE-HOUSE WAS ALREADY GOING FORWARD
THE JOY WAS SHORT-LIVED
ANOTHER ACT PROVIDING FOR THE HIRING OF SLAVES FROM SOUTHERN STATES WAS PASSED IN 1814 FOR THE OSTENSIBLE REASON THAT MILLS COULD NOT BE SUCCESSFULLY OPERATED IN THE TERRITORY FOR WANT OF LABORERS AND THAT THE MANUFACTURE OF SALT COULD NOT BE SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED ON BY WHITE LABORERS YET AS AN UNCONSCIOUS SATIRE UPON SUCH PRETENSES FROM TIME TO TIME THE MOST SAVAGE ACTS WERE PASSED TO PROHIBIT THE IMMIGRATION OF FREE NEGROES INTO THE TERRITORY WHICH WAS REPRESENTED AS PINING FOR BLACK LABOR
THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS WAS GENERALLY APPROVED THROUGHOUT THE WEST AND THOSE WHO OPPOSED IT WERE REGARDED AS RATHER LACKING IN PATRIOTISM EVEN BEFORE ACTUAL HOSTILITIES BEGAN
JENKINS THOSE WHO WENT TO INDIANA WITH THOMAS LINCOLN AND GREW UP WITH HIS CHILDREN ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT NEED DEMAND OUR ATTENTION
IT HAS BEEN THE HABIT OF THE ANTISLAVERY WHIGS WHO HAVE WRITTEN UPON THE SUBJECT TO ASCRIBE THE DISASTER TO AN INDISCRETION OF THE CANDIDATE HIMSELF
HE MET WITH ONLY ONE ACCIDENT ON HIS WAY
LUXURY WAS OF COURSE UNKNOWN
NEITHER HIS MARRIAGE NOR HIS NEW PROFESSIONAL INTERESTS HOWEVER PUT AN END TO HIS PARTICIPATION IN POLITICS
VITAL QUESTIONS THESE WHICH WENT NOT MERELY TO THE INCIDENTS BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL POWERS OF GOVERNMENT
THIS WAS PROBABLY A TASK NOT REQUIRING MUCH PILOT-CRAFT AS THE RIVER WAS MUCH SWOLLEN AND NAVIGATORS HAD IN MOST PLACES TWO OR THREE MILES OF CHANNEL TO COUNT UPON
YOUR NOTE OF YESTERDAY IS RECEIVED
AND EITHER BY A SINGULAR CHANCE OR BECAUSE THE MALADIES OF THE SOUL MAY BE PROPAGATED BY CONSTANT ASSOCIATION THE FEELING OF DESPAIRING MELANCHOLY WHICH HE HAD FOUND SO MORBID AND SO DISTRESSING AN AFFLICTION IN ANOTHER TOOK POSSESSION OF HIMSELF AND THREW HIM INTO THE SAME SLOUGH OF DESPONDENCY FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN LABORING TO RESCUE LINCOLN
THE VOICE OF HOSTILE FACTION IS SILENT OR UNHEEDED
ONE OF HIS COLLEAGUES SAYS THAT ON THIS OCCASION HE USED IN HIS EXCITEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT SINGULARLY EFFECTIVE CLEAR TENOR TONE OF VOICE WHICH AFTERWARDS BECAME SO WIDELY KNOWN IN THE POLITICAL BATTLES OF THE WEST
ARCHIBALD DIXON WHIG SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY
THE WATER WAS REMARKABLY CLEAR FOR THIS RIVER OF PLANTS AND THE FISH APPEARED TO BE SPORTING WITH US AS WE MOVED OVER OR NEAR THEM
THE MOVEMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE HAD BEEN IN ACTIVE PREPARATION FOR WEEKS CONTROLLED BY STRONG AND SECRET COMBINATIONS AND MANY UNWILLING PARTICIPANTS WERE DOUBTLESS SWEPT INTO IT BY AN EXCITED PUBLIC OPINION THEY DARED NOT RESIST

IF THE GOVERNOR HARBORED ANY REMAINING DOUBT THAT THIS BOGUS LEGISLATURE INTENDED TO ASSUME AND MAINTAIN THE MASTERY IT SPEEDILY VANISHED

A CRIMINAL TRIAL WAS A KIND OF HOLIDAY TO A COUNTY
A SHOT FROM THE BRUSH KILLED THE FATHER
HE WOULD STUDY OUT HIS CASE AND MAKE ABOUT AS MUCH OF IT AS ANYBODY SAID LOGAN MANY YEARS AFTERWARDS
THOMAS LINCOLN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN BUILT A TEMPORARY SHELTER OF THE SORT CALLED IN THE FRONTIER LANGUAGE A HALF FACED CAMP
MAY GOD IN HIS MERCY SUPERINTEND THE SOLUTION
IT WAS SAID YOU COULD RECOGNIZE A LEGISLATOR THAT YEAR IN ANY CROWD BY HIS AUTOMATIC REPETITION OF THE PHRASE THIRTEEN HUNDRED--FELLOW-CITIZTENS!--AND FIFTY MILES OF RAILROAD THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO GO ON WITH THE STUPENDOUS FOLLY
IN MAY 1844 THEREFORE BAKER ATTAINED THE DESIRE OF HIS HEART BY BEING NOMINATED AND IN AUGUST HE WAS ELECTED DEFEATING JOHN CALHOUN WHILE LINCOLN HAD THE LABORIOUS AND HONORABLE POST OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTOR
WE WERE ABLE TO WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY WITHOUT DANGER OF REPETITION OR CONFLICT
MAP OF NEW SALEM AND VICINITY PUBLIC OPINION AT NEW SALEM WAS FORMED BY A CROWD OF RUFFIANLY YOUNG FELLOWS WHO WERE CALLED THE CLARY'S GROVE BOYS ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK THEY DESCENDED UPON THE VILLAGE AND PASSED THE DAY IN DRINKING FIGHTING AND BRUTAL HORSE-PLAY
FROM THE HOUR WHEN THE TREATY WAS RECEIVED IN WASHINGTON HOWEVER THE DISCUSSION AS TO THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR NATURALLY LANGUISHED
A JUSTICE IN MCLEAN COUNTY LIVED BY THE BANK OF A RIVER AND HIS SERVICES WERE SOMETIMES REQUIRED BY IMPATIENT LOVERS ON THE OTHER BANK WHEN THE WATERS WERE TOO TORRENTIAL TO CROSS
IT IS DUE TO THE CONSTITUTION HERETOFORE PALPABLY INFRACTED
THIS WORK TAXED THE ENERGIES OF THE LEGISLATURE IN 1839 AND FOR SOME YEARS AFTER
GOVERNOR ROBINSON AND COLONEL LANE WERE APPOINTED TO COMMAND

CRIME CONTRE L'HUMANITE
BUT TEN YEARS LATER A HANDFUL ONLY OF THE KICKAPOOS REMAINED IN SANGAMON COUNTY THE SPECTER OF THE VANISHED PEOPLE
THEY PRACTICED AT THE SAME BAR FOR TWENTY YEARS OFTEN AS ASSOCIATES AND OFTEN AS ADVERSARIES BUT ALWAYS WITH RELATIONS OF MUTUAL CONFIDENCE AND REGARD
IN THESE WORDY ENGAGEMENTS THE WHIGS PARTLY FOR THE REASONS WE HAVE MENTIONED PARTLY THROUGH THEIR UNQUESTIONABLE SUPERIORITY IN DEBATE AND PARTLY BY VIRTUE OF THEIR STRONGER CAUSE USUALLY HAD THE ADVANTAGE
THIS HABIT OF USELESSLY WASTING TIME IS THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY AND IT IS VASTLY IMPORTANT TO YOU AND STILL MORE SO TO YOUR CHILDREN THAT YOU SHOULD BREAK THE HABIT
HE PROMISED TO PAY WHEN HE COULD AND IT TOOK THE LABOR OF YEARS TO DO IT
IT WAS THOUGHT PROBABLE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN ALTOGETHER FITTING THAT EITHER COLONEL HARDIN COLONEL BAKER OR COLONEL BISSELL ALL OF THEM MEN OF INTELLIGENCE AND DISTINCTION SHOULD BE APPOINTED GENERAL OF THE ILLINOIS BRIGADE BUT THE POLK ADMINISTRATION WAS NOT INCLINED TO WASTE SO IMPORTANT A PLACE UPON MEN WHO MIGHT THEREAFTER HAVE VIEWS OF THEIR OWN IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS
2 1869 DURING THE PERIOD WHILE THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WAS CONSIDERING THE APPOINTMENT OF HIS CABINET LINCOLN USED ALL THE INFLUENCE HE COULD BRING TO BEAR WHICH WAS PROBABLY NOT VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF BAKER FOR A PLACE IN THE GOVERNMENT
THEY EVEN INVADED THE CAMP-MEETING AND DID NOT DISDAIN THE PULPIT AS A TRIBUNE
THERE WERE HOT DEBATES IN CONGRESS EMPHATIC RESOLUTIONS BY STATE LEGISLATURES DEEP AGITATION AMONG THE WHOLE PEOPLE AND OPEN THREATS BY THE SOUTH TO DISSOLVE THE UNION
KELSOE CHAIN-BEARER FOR 5 DAYS AT 75 CENTS $3.75
SAGACIOUSLY ANTICIPATING THIS CONTINGENCY THE SOUTHERN STATES HAD BEEN LARGELY INSTRUMENTAL IN SETTING UP THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF TEXAS AND WERE NOW URGENT IN THEIR DEMAND FOR HER ANNEXATION TO THE UNION
WHEN A

HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF AS SPECIALLY COMMISSIONED TO PROCURE THE REMOVAL OF THE STATE CAPITAL FROM VANDALIA TO SPRINGFIELD AND HE APPLIED ALL HIS ENERGIES TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THIS WORK
HE WOULD SIT BY THE FIRE AT NIGHT AND COVER THE WOODEN SHOVEL WITH ESSAYS AND ARITHMETICAL EXERCISES WHICH HE WOULD SHAVE OFF AND THEN BEGIN AGAIN
IF ELECTED THE FUNCTIONS OF THE PLACE WERE DISCHARGED IN ONE DAY AND THE OFFICE PASSED FROM EXISTENCE
MRS LINCOLN'S MOTHER WAS NAMED LUCY HANKS
FROM PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE I CONSIDER MR BOND EVERY WAY WORTHY OF THE OFFICE AND QUALIFIED TO FILL IT
FOR VAN BUREN 291,342
DOUGLAS AND OTHER NORTHERN DEMOCRATS CONTENDED THAT SLAVERY WAS SUBJECT TO LOCAL LAW AND THAT THE PEOPLE OF A TERRITORY LIKE THOSE OF A STATE COULD ESTABLISH OR PROHIBIT IT

OF COURSE THEY WERE NOT SATISFACTORY TO EVERY ONE AND MR CLAY BECAME SO DISQUIETED BY LETTERS OF INQUIRY AND OF CRITICISM FROM THE SOUTH THAT HE WAS AT LAST MOVED IN AN UNFORTUNATE HOUR TO WRITE ANOTHER LETTER TO A FRIEND IN ALABAMA WHICH WAS REGARDED AS SERIOUSLY MODIFYING THE VIEWS HE HAD EXPRESSED IN THE LETTER FROM RALEIGH
IN AFTER DAYS HE RECOGNIZED THE ERROR HE HAD COMMITTED AND CONGRATULATED HIMSELF UPON THE HAPPY DELIVERANCE HE HAD OBTAINED THROUGH NO MERIT OF HIS OWN
THE VOLUNTEERS WERE NOW STRUNG ALONG A HALF MILE OF HILL AND VALLEY WITH NO MORE ORDER OR CARE THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN CHASING RABBITS
JUDGE STEPHEN T

BUT WE SHOULD FALL INTO ERROR IF WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE PIONEERS WERE ALL OF ONE PIECE
THAT SUCH STATES AS WERE FORMED OUT OF THE PORTION LYING SOUTH OF 36 DEGREES 30 THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE LINE MIGHT BE ADMITTED WITH OR WITHOUT SLAVERY AS THE PEOPLE MIGHT DESIRE
THEY DID NOT DIE IN EAGER STRIFE UPON A WELL-FOUGHT FIELD
IT IS THIS WHICH BRINGS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT AFTER EVERY GENERAL ELECTION THAT CROWD OF SPECTERS WITH THEIR BALES OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PITYING COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE BEEN REELECTED WHOSE DIMINISHING PRAYERS RUN DOWN THE WHOLE GAMUT OF SUPPLICATION FROM ST JAMES TO ST PAUL OF LOANDO AND OF WHOM AT THE LAST IT MUST BE SAID AS MR EVARTS ONCE SAID AFTER AN UNUSUALLY HEAVY DAY MANY CALLED BUT FEW CHOSEN OF THOSE WHO DO NOT ACHIEVE THE RUINOUS SUCCESS OF GOING ABROAD TO CONSULATES THAT WILL NOT PAY THEIR BOARD OR MISSIONS WHERE THEY AVOID DAILY SHAME ONLY BY HIDING THEIR PENURY AND THEIR IGNORANCE AWAY FROM OBSERVATION A GREAT PORTION YIELD TO THEIR FATE AND JOIN THAT FLEET OF WRECKS WHICH FLOATS FOREVER ON THE PAVEMENTS OF WASHINGTON

THE ORDINANCE ITSELF PROVIDED FOR THE FORMATION OF NOT LESS THAN THREE NOR MORE THAN FIVE STATES AND UNDER ITS SHIELDING PROVISIONS OHIO INDIANA ILLINOIS MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN WERE ADDED TO THE UNION WITH FREE CONSTITUTIONS
LINCOLN THEN MADE THE EXPLANATION HE HAD BEEN READY TO MAKE FROM THE BEGINNING
FOR A FEW WEEKS IN THE SPRING OF 1849 MR LINCOLN APPEARS IN A CHARACTER WHICH IS ENTIRELY OUT OF KEEPING WITH ALL HIS FORMER AND SUBSEQUENT CAREER
THE FIGHT WAS KEPT UP DURING THE SESSION IN VARIOUS PLACES
HIS SENSE OF DUTY WHICH CONDEMNED HIM IN ONE COURSE AND DID NOT SUSTAIN HIM IN THE OPPOSITE ONE--ALL COMBINED TO MAKE HIM PROFOUNDLY AND PASSIONATELY MISERABLE
HE HAD RISEN FROM LABORER TO STUDENT FROM CLERK TO LAWYER FROM POLITICIAN TO LEGISLATOR
HE USED THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED IN THE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION SO WISELY THAT HE BECAME RATHER EARLY IN LIFE A LARGE LAND-HOLDER AND CONTINUALLY INCREASED HIS POSSESSIONS UNTIL HIS DEATH
FROM THIS AROSE OCCASIONAL HEART BURNINGS AND FEUDS IN WHICH ABRAHAM BORE HIS PART ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY
AGAIN AND AGAIN LINCOLN EXPLAINED TO HIM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPROVING THE WAR AND VOTING SUPPLIES TO THE SOLDIERS BUT HERNDON WAS OBSTINATELY OBTUSE AND THERE WERE MANY OF HIS MIND
REPEAL THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE--REPEAL ALL COMPROMISE--REPEAL THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE--REPEAL ALL PAST HISTORY--STILL YOU CANNOT REPEAL HUMAN NATURE
BUT LOOKING BACK UPON THE WHOLE TRANSACTION--EVEN OVER SO SHORT A DISTANCE AS NOW SEPARATES US FROM IT--ONE CANNOT BUT PERCEIVE THAT THE ATTITUDE OF THE TWO PARTIES WAS IN SOME SORT INEVITABLE AND THAT THE RESULT WAS ALSO SURE WHATEVER THE SUBORDINATE EVENTS OR INCIDENTS WHICH MAY HAVE LED TO IT
OF COURSE THERE WERE RARE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE BUT A SINGLE THEFT ALARMED AND EXCITED A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD
THE REPEAL IF WE CAN EFFECT IT WILL PRODUCE MUCH STIR AND COMMOTION IN THE FREE STATES OF THE UNION FOR A SEASON
AS CONDUCTED HOWEVER IT SHOWED A NOMINAL MAJORITY FOR EVERY PRO-SLAVERY CANDIDATE BUT ONE

UNABLE HIMSELF TO SUCCEED HE WAS NEVERTHELESS SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL TO DEFEAT HIS ADVERSARIES
248 THE SPIRIT WHICH PRODUCED THESE DESPOTIC LAWS ALSO GOVERNED THE METHODS DEVISED TO ENFORCE THEM
THEY WERE SIMPLY STRIKING AND ORIGINAL
RIGHTLY APPRECIATING THE GROWING POWER OF THE PRESS THEY OBTAINED CONTROL OF THE DEMOCRATIC REVIEW A MONTHLY MAGAZINE THEN PROMINENT AS A PARTY ORGAN AND PUBLISHED IN IT A SERIES OF ARTICLES ATTACKING THE RIVAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES IN VERY FLASHY RHETORIC
IT ENGAGED IN NO SPECULATION PAID NO FARE OF ANY EMIGRANTS AND EXPRESSLY DISAVOWED THE REQUIREMENT OF ANY OATH OR PLEDGE OF POLITICAL SENTIMENT OR CONDUCT
IN ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT CONSTITUTE THE GREAT LAWYER HE HAD FEW EQUALS
WHEN VANNOY MURDERED HIS WIFE IN SPRINGFIELD WHOLE FAMILIES PUT ON THEIR BEST CLOTHES AND DROVE FIFTY MILES THROUGH BOTTOMLESS MUD AND SWOLLEN RIVERS TO SEE HIM HANGED
GOVERNOR REEDER TO GWINER AND OTHERS NOV
IT HAD GIVEN RISE TO RESOLUTIONS OF CENSURE TO RESIGNATIONS AND HAD BEEN THE OCCASION OF SOME OF THE GREATEST LEGISLATIVE DEBATES OF THE NATION
MARTIN VAN BUREN WAS NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT AND CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIM ON THE TICKET
THE SCHEME PROVIDED ALSO FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF EVERY STREAM IN THE STATE ON WHICH A CHILD'S SHINGLE-BOAT COULD SAIL
IN THIS WAY ABRAHAM LINCOLN MET AND PASSED THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CRISES OF HIS LIFE
FROM WHAT HE HAD HEARD OF IT HE THOUGHT IT A MATTER WITHIN HIS GRASP IF HE COULD ONCE FALL IN WITH THE REQUISITE MACHINERY
FROM ANYBODY BUT ME THIS WOULD BE AN IMPUDENT QUESTION NOT TO BE TOLERATED
LINCOLN WITH ALMOST UNBOUNDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE SELECTION AND PURCHASE OF VALUABLE TRACTS MADE NO USE WHATEVER OF THEM
THE OPPONENTS OF SLAVERY REGARDED THIS PROVISION WITH GOOD REASON AS DERISIVE
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DID NOT YET EXIST
ILLINOIS IN 1830 THE WINTER OF THE DEEP SNOW
YOUR FRIEND AS EVER AGAIN HE WROTE ON NEW YEAR'S DAY 1840 A LETTER CURIOUSLY DESTITUTE OF ANY FESTAL SUGGESTIONS
THEIR CLOTHING WAS ALL MADE AT HOME
WHEN THE VOTES WERE COUNTED THE EXTENT OF THE DEFECTION AMONG THE NORTHERN WHIGS AND DEMOCRATS WHO VOTED FOR VAN BUREN AND AMONG THE SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS WHO HAD BEEN BEGUILED BY THE EPAULETS OF TAYLOR WAS PLAINLY SEEN
AND SEIZING UPON THE POLITICAL DISAPPOINTMENTS FOLLOWING GENERAL SCOTT'S OVERWHELMING DEFEAT FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN 1852 AND PROFITING BY THE DISINTEGRATION CAUSED BY THE NEBRASKA BILL IT RAPIDLY GAINED RECRUITS BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END WHO HOWEVER DEVOTED LESS ASSIDUOUS ATTENTION TO THE LAW THAN TO THE BUSINESS OF OFFICE-SEEKING WHICH HE PRACTICED WITH FAIR SUCCESS ALL HIS DAYS
NEVERTHELESS THE WAKARUSA WAR LEFT ONE BITTER STING TO RANKLE IN THE HEARTS OF THE DEFENDERS OF LAWRENCE A FREE STATE MAN HAVING BEEN KILLED BY A PRO-SLAVERY SCOUTING PARTY
THEIR HABITATIONS WERE HARDLY SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF THE SAVAGES WITH WHOM THEY WAGED CONSTANT WAR
HE HAD FIVE SONS TO WHOM HE GAVE THE NAMES WHICH WERE TRADITIONAL IN THE FAMILY ABRAHAM THE PIONEER FIRST MENTIONED,--ISAAC JACOB THOMAS AND JOHN
BUT NOW WHEN WE HAVE GROWN FAT AND HAVE LOST ALL DREAD OF BEING SLAVES OURSELVES WE HAVE BECOME SO GREEDY TO BE MASTERS THAT WE CALL THE SAME MAXIM A SELF-EVIDENT LIE THE FOURTH OF JULY HAS NOT QUITE DWINDLED AWAY
THE BANK WILL BE RESUSCITATED WITH SOME TRIFLING MODIFICATIONS STATE AFFAIRS HAVE EVIDENTLY LOST THEIR INTEREST HOWEVER AND HIS SOUL IS IN ARMS FOR THE WIDER FRAY

IF IT FAILED THE RESPONSIBILITY WAS BROADLY SHARED
IF WE CHOSE TO CONTINUE WE COULD FILL THIS VOLUME WITH THE TRIBUTES OF HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES RANGING ALL THE WAY FROM THE COMMONPLACES OF CONDOLENCE TO THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT EULOGY
WHO YET ARE READY TO POUR OUT THEIR HEARTS BEST BLOOD LIKE WATER AND THEIR LIVES WITH IT ON A FOREIGN SHORE IN DEFENSE OF THE AMERICAN FLAG AND AMERICAN GLORY IMMEDIATELY AFTER MAKING THIS SPEECH BAKER INCREASED THE FAVORABLE IMPRESSION CREATED BY IT BY RESIGNING HIS SEAT IN CONGRESS AND HURRYING AS FAST AS STEAM COULD CARRY HIM TO NEW ORLEANS TO EMBARK THERE FOR MEXICO
IN FORMING OUR IDEAS OF LINCOLN'S GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT AS A LAWYER WE MUST REMEMBER THAT IN THOSE EARLY DAYS LITIGATION WAS VERY SIMPLE AS COMPARED WITH THAT OF MODERN TIMES
SEE GOVERNOR ROBINSON'S MESSAGE TO THE FREE-STATE LEGISLATURE MARCH 4 1856
1856 PP
COLONEL SUMNER A MOST CAREFUL AND CONSCIENTIOUS OFFICER AND A FREE-STATE MAN AT HEART WITH DUE FORMALITY WITH DECISION AND FIRMNESS BUT AT THE SAME TIME OPENLY EXPRESSING THE PAINFUL NATURE OF HIS DUTY COMMANDED THE PROVISIONAL LEGISLATURE THEN ABOUT TO ASSEMBLE TO DISPERSE
FOR A FRONTIER STATE THE PRO-SLAVERY SENTIMENT OF MISSOURI WAS VERY PRONOUNCED ESPECIALLY ALONG THE KANSAS BORDER
I MET A SOLDIER IN THE ROAD AND HAVING BEEN ALWAYS TOLD AT HOME THAT WE MUST BE GOOD TO THE SOLDIERS I GAVE HIM MY FISH THIS IS ONLY A FAINT GLIMPSE BUT WHAT IT SHOWS IS RATHER PLEASANT--THE GENEROUS CHILD AND THE PATRIOTIC HOUSEHOLD
WILLIAM WALLACE DECEMBER 21 1850
WE HAVE SEEN TOO OFTEN THE DANGER OF SUCH A RELIANCE IN THE REMINISCENCES OF OTHERS
AND THE STILL GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN THE ADORNMENT OF WOMEN THE FORMER BARE FEET DECENTLY SHOD AND HOMESPUN FROCKS GIVING WAY TO GOWNS OF CALICO AND SILK AND THE HEADS TIED UP IN RED COTTON TURBANS DISAPPEARING IN FAVOR OF THOSE SURMOUNTED BY PRETTY BONNETS OF SILK OR STRAW
BUT HE SOON FELT THE EASY MASTERY OF HIS POWERS COME BACK TO HIM AND HE FINALLY MADE WHAT WAS UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS THE STRONGEST SPEECH OF THE DAY
SOME WERE FOUND WEEKS AFTERWARDS IN THE SNOW DRIFTS THEIR FLESH GNAWED BY FAMISHED WOLVES
THE CHIEF INTEREST OF THE CAMPAIGN FINALLY CENTERED IN A SORT OF POLITICAL TOURNAMENT WHICH TOOK PLACE AT THE CAPITAL SPRINGFIELD DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF OCTOBER
THE NEMESIS WHICH WAITS UPON MEN OF EXTRAORDINARY WIT OR HUMOR HAS NOT NEGLECTED MR LINCOLN AND THE YOUNG LAWYERS OF ILLINOIS WHO NEVER KNEW HIM HAVE AN ENDLESS STORE OF JOKES AND PLEASANTRIES IN HIS NAME
THAT HOWEVER IS NOW PAST AND THE VOW IS CANCELED BY YOUR DEFEAT HE THEN WENT ON WITH THREATS EQUALLY INDECENT TO MAKE CERTAIN DEMANDS WHICH WERE ALTOGETHER INADMISSIBLE AND WHICH JUDGE BREESE ONLY NOTICED BY SENDING THIS PREPOSTEROUS LETTER TO THE PRESS
THE AIR WAS ALREADY TREMULOUS WITH FAINT BUGLE-NOTES THAT HERALDED A CONFLICT OF GIANTS ON A FIELD OF MORAL SIGNIFICANCE TO WHICH HE WAS FULLY ALIVE AND AWAKE WHERE HE WAS CERTAIN TO LEAD AT LEAST HIS HUNDREDS AND HIS THOUSANDS
HERE WITHOUT CONTEMPLATING CONSEQUENCES BEFORE HEAVEN AND IN FACE OF THE WORLD I SWEAR ETERNAL FEALTY TO THE JUST CAUSE AS I DEEM IT OF THE LAND OF MY LIFE MY LIBERTY AND MY LOVE
A REPORT IS IN CIRCULATION HERE NOW THAT HE HAS ABANDONED THE IDEA OF GOING TO WASHINGTON
THERE WAS EVEN AN UNDERCURRENT OF SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF REPUDIATION
SHE WAS HANDSOME AND INTELLIGENT AND OF AN ADMIRABLE TEMPER AND DISPOSITION
THE MEMORY OF HIS FLAT-BOATING DAYS OF HIS ILLITERATE YOUTH EVEN OF HIS DEER-SKIN BREECHES SHRUNKEN BY RAIN AND EXPOSURE APPEARED TO HAVE NO POWER AGAINST THIS UNEXPECTED AND BALEFUL CHARGE
THE SENATE HOWEVER WAS NOT SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO POPULAR IMPRESSIONS AND THE BILL PREPARED IN OBEDIENCE TO THE MANDATE OF THE HOUSE NEVER GOT FARTHER THAN THE DESK OF THE SENATE CHAMBER

THEY WENT TO LIVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE AT A BOARDING-HOUSE FOOTNOTE
A FEW TRIALS SUFFICED TO SHOW SOUTHERN PLANTERS THAT WITH THEIR SOIL AND THEIR SLAVES THEY COULD SUPPLY THIS DEMAND WITH A QUALITY OF COTTON WHICH WOULD DEFY COMPETITION AND AT A PROFIT TO THEMSELVES FAR EXCEEDING THAT OF ANY OTHER PRODUCT OF AGRICULTURE
EVEN THE GREAT FAME AND CONSPICUOUSNESS OF THE PRESIDENT DID NOT TEMPT THEM OUT OF THEIR RETIREMENT
I HAD SUPPOSED UNTIL WE NOW MET THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN MR LINCOLN HAVING FORGOTTEN THAT IN THE FALL OF 1848 WHEN HE TOOK THE STUMP IN NEW ENGLAND HE CALLED UPON ME AT ALBANY AND THAT WE WENT TO SEE MR FILLMORE WHO WAS THEN THE WHIG CANDIDATE FOR VICE-PRESIDENT THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE SEPTEMBER 14 1848 MENTIONS MR LINCOLN AS ADDRESSING A GREAT WHIG MEETING IN BOSTON SEPTEMBER 12
IT MIGHT NATURALLY HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THAT SUCH AN EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE GIVEN LESS OFFENSE TO THE OPPONENTS THAN TO THE FRIENDS OF SLAVERY
SHE HAD MADE APPLICATION IN 1817 AND NOW IN 1819 IT WAS PROPOSED TO AUTHORIZE HER TO FORM A CONSTITUTION
THE MEMBERS WERE ALL ELECTED ON ONE TICKET BUT THEY ALL LOOKED TO LINCOLN AS THE HEAD STEPHEN T LOGAN IN BOTH OF THESE HE WAS SUCCESSFUL
THE DEMOCRATS OF NEW SALEM WORKED FOR LINCOLN OUT OF THEIR PERSONAL REGARD FOR HIM
LET US REPURIFY IT
AND RESERVING AS SHE DOUBTLESS WILL THE NORTH-WESTERN BOUNDARY QUESTION AS THE CAUSE OF WAR WITH US WHENEVER SHE CHOOSES TO DECLARE IT--LET US SUPPOSE THAT AS AN ALLY WITH TEXAS WE ARE TO FIGHT HER
FOR THE ADJUSTMENT OF HER STATE BOUNDARIES TEXAS RECEIVED TEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
THEY WERE TO ORGANIZE THE WHIG PARTY OF ILLINOIS AND AFTERWARDS THE REPUBLICAN
THEY WANTED AT THIS SESSION TO ELECT A SENATOR AND PROVIDE FOR THE CONVENTION
HIS FINAL RELEASE FROM THE SERVICE WAS SIGNED BY A YOUNG LIEUTENANT OF ARTILLERY ROBERT ANDERSON WHO TWENTY-NINE YEARS LATER IN ONE OF THE MOST AWFUL CRISES IN OUR ANNALS WAS TO SUSTAIN TO LINCOLN RELATIONS OF PRODIGIOUS IMPORTANCE ON A SCENE ILLUMINATED BY THE FLASH OF THE OPENING GUNS OF THE CIVIL WAR
THEIR EXCHANGES WERE MADE BY BARTER
TO ADD BRIGHTNESS TO THE SUN OR GLORY TO THE NAME OF WASHINGTON IS ALIKE IMPOSSIBLE

THE WHIG MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURES OF ILLINOIS IOWA AND WISCONSIN JOINED IN THIS EFFORT WHICH CAME TO NOTHING
IN HIS APPOINTMENT OF ELECTION OFFICERS CENSUS-TAKERS JUSTICES OF THE PEACE AND CONSTABLES HE WAS CAREFUL TO MAKE HIS SELECTIONS FROM BOTH FACTIONS AS FAIRLY AS POSSIBLE EXCEPTING THAT AS A GREATER AND NECESSARY SAFEGUARD AGAINST ANOTHER INVASION HE DESIGNATED IN THE SEVERAL ELECTION DISTRICTS ALONG THE MISSOURI BORDER TWO FREE-STATE MEN AND ONE PRO-SLAVERY MAN TO ACT AS JUDGES AT EACH POLL

IBID SIDENOTE
GO FORWARD IN THE PATHWAY OF DUTY AS YOU PROPOSE AND THOUGH ALL THE WORLD DESERT YOU I NEVER WILL FOOTNOTE
THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXTRACT FROM THE COURT RECORD
A SORT OF TRADITION HAD GROWN UP THROUGH WHICH A PERVERTED NOTION OF HONOR AND PROPRIETY HELD IT DISCREDITABLE IN A MEMBER TO ASK FOR REELECTION
THEY CAME AND BROUGHT THEIR FRIENDS SO IT HAPPENED THAT IN THIS IMMENSE COUNTY SEVERAL THOUSAND SQUARE MILES IN EXTENT THE SETTLEMENT OF JOHN KELLY AT SPRING CREEK WAS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THERE WAS SHELTER FOR THE COMMISSIONERS
THIS WAS PERFECTLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POSITION HELD BY MOST DEMOCRATS BEFORE THE RIO GRANDE BOUNDARY WAS MADE AN ARTICLE OF FAITH BY THE PRESIDENT
CHICAGO HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME ONLY ONE GREAT TOWN-MARKET
HE THEN WROTE TO HIS FRIEND AND PARTNER HERNDON
EVEN SO LATE AS 1848 WE FIND A REMARKABLE LETTER FROM MR LINCOLN WHO WAS THEN IN CONGRESS BEARING UPON THE SAME POINT
HE APPROVED A MOVEMENT--NOT ENTIRELY DISINTERESTED LOOKING TO HIS NOMINATION FOR GROVERNOR
HAMPTON OF KENTUCKY
HE WENT TO HIS PLACE ON THE FLOOR AND THERE DELIVERED A BRIGHT INTERESTING SPEECH IN HIS MOST ATTRACTIVE VEIN CALLING ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF THE ARMY DISAVOWING ON THE PART OF THE WHIGS ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WAR OR ITS CONDUCT AND ADROITLY CLAIMING FOR THEM A FULL SHARE OF THE CREDIT FOR ITS PROSECUTION
BUT THE EFFECTS REMAINED IN PERIODICAL ATTACKS OF GLOOM AND DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS WHICH WOULD SEEM INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO THOROUGHLY HEALTHY ORGANIZATIONS AND WHICH GRADUALLY LESSENED IN MIDDLE LIFE OFTEN TO DISAPPEAR ENTIRELY IN OLD AGE
I DID NOT NEED THE MONEY HE SAID
ONE NIGHT THERE WAS A DISCUSSION IN WHICH E
BEFORE I VOTE FOR PRESIDENT I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE CANDIDATE I SUPPORT WILL NOT SO ACT AS TO DIVEST ME OF MY PROPERTY TO WHICH THE GENERAL WITH A DEXTERITY THAT WOULD HAVE DONE CREDIT TO A DIPLOMATIST AND WOULD HAVE PROVED EXCEEDINGLY USEFUL TO MR CLAY RESPONDED SIR
THOUGH SPEAKING OF AUTHENTICITY YOU KNOW THAT IF WE HAD HEARD DOUGLAS SAY THAT HE HAD ABANDONED THE CONTEST IT WOULD NOT BE VERY AUTHENTIC
THERE SEEMED TO BE NO LIMIT TO HIS POPULARITY NOR TO HIS APTITUDES IN THE OPINION OF HIS ADMIRERS
A FEW WEEKS LATER CONGRESS ADJOURNED AND LINCOLN WITHOUT RETURNING HOME ENTERED UPON THE CANVASS IN NEW ENGLAND TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE
THAT SPIRIT WHICH DESIRED THE PEACEFUL EXTINCTION OF SLAVERY HAS ITSELF BECOME EXTINCT WITH THE OCCASION AND THE MEN OF THE REVOLUTION
THIS EVENT APPEARED DEFINITELY TO SWEEP AWAY THE LAST OBSTACLE IN THE PATH OF THE CONSPIRATORS

IN THE YEAR 1840 HE BECAME ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO MISS MARY TODD OF LEXINGTON KENTUCKY A YOUNG LADY OF GOOD EDUCATION AND EXCELLENT CONNECTIONS WHO WAS VISITING HER SISTER MRS NINIAN W
EARLY IN THE YEAR 1834 WE FIND HIM APPOINTED ONE OF THREE VIEWERS TO LOCATE A ROAD FROM SALT CREEK TO THE COUNTY LINE IN THE DIRECTION OF JACKSONVILLE
PARKS IN DEFENDING A MAN ACCUSED OF LARCENY
BUT LINCOLN MADE NO EFFORT EVEN TO COMPROMISE THE CLAIMS AGAINST HIM
ONE WAS A BILL FOR A LOAN TO MEET THE HONEST OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMMONWEALTH COMMONLY CALLED THE WIGGINS LOAN
THE ONE FOLLOWED THE OTHER NATURALLY
HE HAD HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF MEASURING HIMSELF WITH THE LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY AND HAD FOUND NO DIFFICULTY WHATEVER IN KEEPING PACE WITH THEM
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT LINCOLN DID NOT DESIRE THE DEATH OF HIS ADVERSARY AND DID NOT INTEND TO BE MATERIALLY INJURED HIMSELF
ALMOST THE ONLY FESTIVITIES WERE THOSE THAT ACCOMPANIED WEDDINGS AND THESE WERE OF COURSE OF A PRIMITIVE KIND
THIS MODE OF DESTRUCTION BEING SLOW AND UNDRAMATIC AND AN ATTEMPT TO BLOW IT UP WITH GUNPOWDER HAVING PROVED EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY THE TORCH WAS APPLIED AND THE STRUCTURE GIVEN TO THE FLAMES
TO THE THEORETICAL DISPUTE WAS ADDED A PRACTICAL CONTEST
THE NEXT GREAT ERROR WAS THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE
THE OBJECTIONS OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA SUFFICED TO CAUSE THE ERASURE AND SUPPRESSION OF THE OBNOXIOUS PARAGRAPH
HE IMMEDIATELY CAME TO MY SEAT AND COURTEOUSLY REMONSTRATED AGAINST MY AMENDMENT SUGGESTING THAT THE BILL WHICH HE HAD INTRODUCED WAS ALMOST IN THE WORDS OF THE TERRITORIAL ACTS FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF UTAH AND
DOUGLAS'S CHICAGO SPEECH
THE GOVERNOR AND A MAJORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE WERE ELECTED AS JACKSON DEMOCRATS BUT THE WHIGS WERE AS EARNEST IN PASSING THESE MEASURES AS THEIR OPPONENTS
THE SLAVES WERE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ENUMERATION FOR REPRESENTATION FIVE BLACKS TO BE COUNTED AS THREE WHITES

DURING THE FIRST YEAR OR TWO HE IS PRINCIPALLY REMEMBERED IN SPRINGFIELD AS AN EXCELLENT TALKER THE LIFE AND SOUL OF THE LITTLE GATHERINGS ABOUT THE COUNTY OFFICES A STORY TELLER OF THE FIRST RANK A GOOD-NATURED FRIENDLY FELLOW WHOM EVERYBODY LIKED AND TRUSTED
IN THE WAR OF THE REBELLION HE WAS AGAIN APPOINTED A BRIGADIER-GENERAL BY HIS OLD ADVERSARY AND WAS AGAIN WOUNDED IN A BATTLE IN WHICH HIS TROOPS DEFEATED THE REDOUBTABLE STONEWALL JACKSON
LINCOLN PRINTED IN THE WILLIAMSPORT PA BANNER FEB
LIKE THE MAJORITY OF WESTERN MEN HE HAD RISEN FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS AND FROM BEING AN EMIGRANT FARMER MERCHANT AND MANUFACTURER HAD BECOME GOVERNOR
HE HAD MET WITH CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS AS A LAWYER THOUGH HE ALWAYS RELIED RATHER UPON HIS ELOQUENCE THAN HIS LAW AND THERE WERE FEW JURIES WHICH COULD RESIST THE FORCE AND FURY OF HIS SPEECH AND NOT MANY LAWYERS COULD KEEP THEIR EQUANIMITY IN THE FACE OF HIS WITTY PERSIFLAGE AND SAVAGE SARCASM
BUT HOW UNITE THIS OPPOSITION MADE UP OF WHIGS OF DEMOCRATS AND OF SO-CALLED ABOLITIONISTS
THE FACT IS THE COUNTRY DELEGATES MADE THE NOMINATIONS AS THEY PLEASED AND THEY PLEASED TO MAKE THEM ALL FROM THE COUNTRY EXCEPT BAKER AND ME WHOM THEY SUPPOSED NECESSARY TO MAKE STUMP SPEECHES
MR LINCOLN WAS ELECTED AT THE HEAD OF THE POLL BY A MAJORITY GREATLY IN EXCESS OF THE AVERAGE MAJORITY OF HIS FRIENDS WHICH SHOWS CONCLUSIVELY HOW HIS INFLUENCE AND POPULARITY HAD INCREASED
THE FRAMEWORK OF HIS MENTAL AND MORAL BEING WAS HONESTY AND A WRONG CAUSE WAS POORLY DEFENDED BY HIM
IT WAS THE AUTHENTIC RECORD OF THE BEGINNING OF A GREAT AND MOMENTOUS CAREER
THAT LINCOLN FOUND MUCH COMFORT AND EDIFICATION IN THAT GENIAL COMPANIONSHIP IS SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT AFTER HE BECAME PRESIDENT HE SENT TO MR SPEED'S MOTHER A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIMSELF INSCRIBED FOR MRS LUCY G
THIS LAST CHARGE SO AMAZED LINCOLN THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO FRAME ANY SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO IT
THESE FAILED HIM HOWEVER WHEN THE TIME OF TRIAL ARRIVED AND AN IMPROVISED FORCE OF STATE VOLUNTEERS ASSISTED BY GENERAL E
THE INDIANS KILLED ALL THEY CAUGHT UP WITH
CORRESPONDENCE WITH SPEED
A DEMOCRATIC INVASION HAD ELECTED A DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE WHICH ENACTED LAWS UNDER WHOSE ARBITRARY NON-INTERVENTION A DEMOCRATIC COURT MIGHT FASTEN A BALL AND CHAIN TO THEIR ANKLES IF THEY SHOULD HAPPEN TO READ THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE TO A NEGRO OR CARRY JEFFERSON'S NOTES ON VIRGINIA IN THEIR CARPET-BAGS

THE SOUTH DECLARED THAT ANY SUCH EXCLUSION WOULD NOT ONLY BE UNJUST AND IMPOLITIC BUT ABSOLUTELY UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE PROPERTY IN SLAVES MIGHT ENTER AND MUST BE PROTECTED IN THE TERRITORIES IN COMMON WITH ALL OTHER PROPERTY
THEIR HOSTESS AN INTELLIGENT AND QUICK-WITTED WOMAN AT ONCE SUGGESTED AN EXPEDIENT
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT HE GAVE A NOTABLE PROOF OF HIS UNUSUAL POWERS OF MENTAL DISCIPLINE
GOVERNOR SHANNON ORDER TO RICHARDSON NOVEMBER 27 1855
ACCORDINGLY TWELVE DAYS AFTERWARDS OCTOBER 16 THEY ONCE MORE MET IN DEBATE AT PEORIA
BOTH PARTIES WERE ZEALOUS VIGILANT AND DENUNCIATORY
HE USED TO GO TO DAVID TURNHAM'S THE TOWN CONSTABLE AND DEVOUR THE REVISED STATUTES OF INDIANA AS BOYS IN OUR DAY DO THE THREE GUARDSMEN OF THE BOOKS HE DID NOT OWN HE TOOK VOLUMINOUS NOTES FILLING HIS COPY-BOOK WITH CHOICE EXTRACTS AND PORING OVER THEM UNTIL THEY WERE FIXED IN HIS MEMORY
THE STATE COULD ENTER LARGE TRACTS AND SELL THEM AT A PROFIT

ONE WAS THAT THE INDIAN TITLE IN THAT TERRITORY HAD NOT BEEN EXTINGUISHED OR AT LEAST A VERY SMALL PORTION OF IT HAD BEEN
THE CLAIMS OF CONSANGUINITY WERE MORE REGARDED THAN NOW
EDWARDS
BUT IN THE PETTY DETAILS OF EVERY DAY IN THEIR ORDINARY TALK AND IN THEIR ROUTINE LEGISLATION THEIR SYMPATHIES WERE STILL WITH THE SLAVE-HOLDERS
IT IS WITH THE ADVANTAGE THEREFORE OF A WIDE PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH ALL THE LEADING PARTICIPANTS OF THE WAR AND OF PERFECT FAMILIARITY WITH THE MANUSCRIPT MATERIAL AND ALSO WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE VAST BULK OF PRINTED RECORDS AND TREATISES WHICH HAVE ACCUMULATED SINCE 1865 THAT WE HAVE PROSECUTED THIS WORK TO ITS CLOSE
THE TAINT OF SLAVERY THE CONTAGION OF A PLAGUE THEY HAD NOT QUITE ESCAPED WAS ON THE PEOPLE OF ILLINOIS
SOME OF THEM HAD INDEED ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS USED INTEMPERATE AND OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE
THAT AND THAT ONLY IS SELF-GOVERNMENT
DAVID DAVIS FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY BRADY
THE MORALITY OF THE FRONTIER WAS DEPLORABLY LOOSE IN SUCH MATTERS AND MOST OF THESE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE FAILURE OF THE BUSINESS EXPUNGED ITS LIABILITIES
PUBLIC MEETINGS OF HIS OWN FORMER PARTY FRIENDS HAD DENOUNCED HIM
THE PROCEEDINGS HAD WASTED AWAY A LONG AFTERNOON OF MOST TEDIOUS SUSPENSE
SEE ALSO HIS SPEECH OF FEBRUARY 24 1847 CARRIED ON DURING A TERM OF YEARS WITH UNEXAMPLED ENERGY TRUCULENCE AND TREACHERY
THERE WERE SOME SCHOOLS SO-CALLED BUT NO QUALIFICATION WAS EVER REQUIRED OF A TEACHER BEYOND READIN WRITIN AND CIPHERIN TO THE RULE OF THREE IF A STRAGGLER SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND LATIN HAPPENED TO SOJOURN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HE WAS LOOKED UPON AS A WIZARD
ON THE OTHER SIDE THE WOULD-BE MEMBERS IN SUPERIOR NUMBERS WITH THEIR PISTOLS AND BOWIE-KNIVES
THE WOOING OF THOSE DAYS WAS PROMPT AND PRACTICAL

AS A MEASURE FULL OF DANGER TO THE PEACE AND EVEN THE EXISTENCE OF OUR BELOVED UNION AND EXPOSING US TO THE RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT OF THE ALMIGHTY IN RETURN DOUGLAS MADE A MOST VIRULENT ONSLAUGHT ON THEIR POLITICAL ACTION
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS VERY SOON ABANDONED
IT IS GREATLY TO HIS CREDIT THAT HE NEVER THOUGHT OF DOING BY OTHERS AS OTHERS HAD DONE BY HIM
BY CLOSE STUDY OF EACH CASE AS IT CAME UP HE GOT TO BE QUITE A FORMIDABLE LAWYER THE CHARACTER OF THE MAN IS IN THESE WORDS
IN THE OTHER IT WAS TRUE PATRIOTISM A SENSE OF DUTY
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCER FEB
ALSO THE TERRITORY LYING BETWEEN THE LAST-NAMED RIVER AND THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND NORTH OF THE GILA RIVER AND THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF NEW MEXICO WHICH WAS A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE THE TOWN OF EL PASO ILLUSTRATION
THE NATION SETTLED ITSELF FOR A PERIOD OF QUIET TO REPAIR THE WASTE AND UTILIZE THE CONQUESTS OF THE MEXICAN WAR
WHICH BEING INCONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERVENTION BY CONGRESS WITH SLAVERY IN THE STATES AND TERRITORIES AS RECOGNIZED BY THE LEGISLATION OF 1850 COMMONLY CALLED THE COMPROMISE MEASURES IS HEREBY DECLARED INOPERATIVE AND VOID
AFTER LISTENING ONE DAY TO A PRAYER FROM A YOUNG MINISTER WHICH SHONE MORE BY ITS CORRECTNESS THAN ITS UNCTION HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING BROTHER THREE PRAYERS LIKE THAT WOULD FREEZE HELL OVER A CONSUMMATION WHICH DID NOT COMMEND ITSELF TO HIM AS DESIRABLE
EVEN GOVERNOR COLES THE PUBLIC-SPIRITED AND POPULAR POLITICIAN WAS INDICTED AND SEVERELY FINED FOR HAVING BROUGHT HIS OWN FREEDMEN INTO THE STATE AND HAVING ASSISTED THEM IN ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES AROUND HIM UPON FARMS OF THEIR OWN
COMPLIED WITH THE FORMER SUGGESTION BUT FLATLY REFUSED TO TOUCH THEIR MASTERPIECE
WHEN IN THE OPENING OF THE ANTI-NEBRASKA CONTEST THE FREE-SOIL LEADERS UNDERTOOK THE FORMATION OF A NEW PARTY TO SUPERSEDE THE OLD THEY HAD BECAUSE OF THEIR GENERALLY DEMOCRATIC ANTECEDENTS WITH GREAT UNANIMITY PROPOSED THAT IT BE CALLED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THUS REVIVING THE DISTINCTIVE APPELLATION BY WHICH THE FOLLOWERS OF JEFFERSON WERE KNOWN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE REPUBLIC

IF HE WAS FORCIBLE BEFORE A JURY HE WAS EQUALLY SO WITH THE COURT

GEO
HIS PLAN WAS NOT ADOPTED
BUT THE SILENCE COULD NOT BE LONG MAINTAINED
DURING AND AFTER THE CONTEST OVER THE SPEAKERSHIP AT WASHINGTON EACH STATE LEGISLATURE BECAME A FORUM OF KANSAS DEBATE
HIS FATHER LEFT HIS HOME IN MACON COUNTY ALSO ON ACCOUNT OF THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF THE ATTACKS OF FEVER AND AGUE WHICH WERE SUFFERED THERE
HIS RADIANT GOOD-FELLOWSHIP WAS BELOVED AND SOUGHT ALIKE BY POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND PARTISAN FRIENDS
STILL FOLLOWING OUT THE POLICY AGREED UPON THE DELEGATES CHOSEN MET AT TOPEKA ON THE 23D OF OCTOBER AND WITH PROPER DELIBERATION AND DECORUM FRAMED A STATE CONSTITUTION WHICH WAS IN TURN SUBMITTED TO A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE
WE OMITTED ALSO A LARGE NUMBER OF CHAPTERS WHICH ALTHOUGH ESSENTIAL TO A HISTORY OF THE TIME AND DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH THE LIFE OF MR LINCOLN WERE STILL EPISODICAL IN THEIR NATURE AND WERE PERHAPS NOT INDISPENSABLE TO A COMPREHENSION OF THE PRINCIPAL EVENTS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION
SEVENTH WHETHER OUR CITIZENS WHOSE BLOOD WAS SHED AS IN HIS MESSAGES DECLARED WERE OR WERE NOT AT THAT TIME ARMED OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS SENT INTO THAT SETTLEMENT BY THE MILITARY ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT THROUGH THE SECRETARY OF WAR
CASTING THEIR EYES ONCE MORE UPON THE BROAD EXPANSE OF AMERICAN POLITICS THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE REPORTED
SETTLES AT GENTRYVILLE
A NEW PRESS WAS ORDERED AND ARRIVED AND WAS STORED IN A WAREHOUSE WHERE LOVEJOY AND HIS FRIENDS SHUT THEMSELVES UP DETERMINED TO DEFEND IT WITH THEIR LIVES
SO FAR AS THAT QUESTION IS CONCERNED WE MIGHT AS WELL AGREE TO THE ADMISSION OF THIS TERRITORY NOW AS NEXT YEAR OR FIVE OR TEN YEARS HENCE SIDENOTE
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE ORATOR AND THE PARTISAN CONCERNED IN THIS CAMPAIGN OF 1844
MCCLERNAND FROM ILLINOIS PETIT FROM INDIANA AND SCHENEK A WHIG FROM OHIO IN ALL SEVENTY-NINE GREELEY'S AMERICAN CONFLICT I
HE SEEMED TO GRUDGE THE SPACE REQUIRED FOR NECESSARY PARTS OF SPEECH
OPPOSITION AT THE NORTH
PREPARATORY TO SUCH A MOVEMENT SHE SENDS HER 20,000 OR 30,000 MEN TO TEXAS
HE WAS BELOVED RESPECTED AND SERVED BY HIS ADHERENTS WITH A SINGLE-HEARTED ALLEGIANCE WHICH SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO THE MORE COMPLEX LIFE OF A LATER GENERATION
IF WHAT I FEEL WERE EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED TO THE WHOLE HUMAN FAMILY THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE CHEERFUL FACE ON EARTH
HERE WE FIND HE RETORTED THAT A LARGE BODY OF PREACHERS PERHAPS THREE THOUSAND FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF A CIRCULAR WHICH WAS ISSUED BY THE ABOLITION CONFEDERATES IN THIS BODY CALCULATED TO DECEIVE AND MISLEAD THE PUBLIC HAVE HERE COME FORWARD WITH AN ATROCIOUS FALSEHOOD AND AN ATROCIOUS CALUMNY AGAINST THIS SENATE DESECRATED THE PULPIT AND PROSTITUTED THE SACRED DESK TO THE MISERABLE AND CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF PARTY POLITICS ALL HIS NEWSPAPERS AND PARTISANS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY CAUGHT THE STYLE AND SPIRIT OF HIS WARFARE AND BOLDLY DENIED THE MORAL RIGHT OF THE CLERGY TO TAKE PART IN POLITICS OTHERWISE THAN BY A SILENT VOTE
IT WAS ONLY NATURAL THAT THE WHIGS SHOULD PROFIT BY THE GLORY GAINED BY WHIG VALOR NO MATTER IN WHAT CAUSE
NO CLEARER OR MORE AUTHORITATIVE STATEMENT OF LINCOLN'S RANK AS A LAWYER CAN EVER BE MADE THAN IS FOUND IN THESE BRIEF SENTENCES IN WHICH THE WARMTH OF PERSONAL AFFECTION IS NOT PERMITTED TO DISTURB THE MEASURED APPRECIATION THE HABITUAL RESERVE OF THE EMINENT JURIST
THERE WAS NO REASON THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN SHOULD TAKE ESPECIAL NOTICE OF THESE RESOLUTIONS MORE THAN ANOTHER
MOVED BY A PRO-SLAVERY SYMPATHY THAT WAS SINCERE JUDGE LECOMPTE LENT HIS HIGH AUTHORITY TO THE INTERESTS OF THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST KANSAS
ALTHOUGH THE OLD SETTLERS OF SANGAMON COUNTY ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THESE FACTS AND WE HAVE OFTEN HEARD THEM AND MANY OTHERS LIKE THEM FROM THE LIPS OF EYE-WITNESSES WE HAVE PREFERRED TO CITE ONLY THESE INCIDENTS OF THE SUDDEN CHANGE WHICH ARE GIVEN IN THE CAREFUL AND CONSCIENTIOUS COMPILATION ENTITLED THE EARLY SETTLERS OF SANGAMON COUNTY BY JOHN CARROLL POWER THE PIONEER PERIOD OF ILLINOIS WAS ENDING AS THOMAS LINCOLN AND HIS TALL BOY DROVE THEIR OX-TEAM OVER THE INDIANA LINE
I KNOW THAT THE GREAT VOLCANO AT WASHINGTON AROUSED AND DIRECTED BY THE EVIL SPIRIT THAT REIGNS THERE IS BELCHING FORTH THE LAVA OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION IN A CURRENT BROAD AND DEEP WHICH IS SWEEPING WITH FRIGHTFUL VELOCITY OVER THE WHOLE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE LAND BIDDING FAIR TO LEAVE UNSCATHED NO GREEN SPOT OR LIVING THING
HE WAS KILLED AT THE BATTLE OF THE BLUE LICKS IN 1782
THE COMMITTEE ON TERRITORIES THROUGH DOUGLAS HIMSELF AS CHAIRMAN IN A LONG PARTISAN REPORT DISMISSED IT WITH THE ASSERTION THAT IT WAS THE MOVEMENT OF A POLITICAL PARTY INSTEAD OF THE WHOLE BODY OF THE PEOPLE OF KANSAS CONDUCTED WITHOUT THE SANCTION OF LAW AND IN DEFIANCE OF THE CONSTITUTED AUTHORITIES FOR THE AVOWED PURPOSE OF OVERTHROWING THE TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED BY CONGRESS IN THE MOUTH OF A CONSISTENT ADVOCATE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY THIS ARGUMENT MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME FORCE
369 TO 372 SIDENOTE
AS TO THE GROSSER AND RUDER SHAPES TAKEN BY THE DIVERSIONS OF THE PIONEERS WE WILL LET MR HERNDON SPEAK--THEIR CONTEMPORARY ANNALIST AND ARDENT PANEGYRIST
IT IS SAID BY GOVERNOR FORD THAT THE LONG NINE WERE NOT AVERSE TO USING THE HOPES AND FEARS OF OTHER MEMBERS IN RELATION TO THEIR SPECIAL RAILROADS TO GAIN THEIR ADHERENCE TO THE SPRINGFIELD PROGRAMME BUT THIS IS BY NO MEANS CLEAR
THE RANK WOODS WERE FULL OF MALARIA AND SINGULAR EPIDEMICS FROM TIME TO TIME RAVAGED THE SETTLEMENTS
I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE WROTE ONE OF THEIR PROMINENT MEN THAT BEFORE TO-MORROW MORNING THE BLACK FLAG WILL BE HOISTED WHEN NINE OUT OF TEN WILL RALLY ROUND IT AND MARCH WITHOUT ORDERS UPON LAWRENCE
AND PERHAPS IF HE FINDS HIMSELF BACKED BY ONE OF THE STATES HE MAY BE INDUCED TO TAKE IT UP AGAIN AFTER THE SESSION OPENED JANUARY 20 HE WROTE TO MR STUART ACCURATELY OUTLINING THE WORK OF THE WINTER
WITH PUBLIC OPINION PROPITIATED IN ADVANCE AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE TERRITORY THUS PUBLICLY COMMITTED TO THEIR PARTY THE CONSPIRATORS FELT THEMSELVES READY TO ENTER UPON THE ACTIVE CAMPAIGN TO CRUSH OUT OPPOSITION FOR WHICH THEY HAD MADE SUCH ELABORATE PREPARATIONS
THE OPPOSITION TO IT--AS USUALLY HAPPENS--CONSISTED PARTLY IN THE NATURAL EFFORT OF PARTISANS TO BAFFLE THEIR OPPONENTS AND PARTLY IN AN HONORABLE PROTEST OF HEART AND CONSCIENCE AGAINST A GREAT WRONG COMMITTED IN THE INTEREST OF A NATIONAL SIN
BETWEEN ARBITRARY WRONG CONSECRATED BY TRADITION AND LAW AND THE UNFOLDING RECOGNITION OF PRIVATE RIGHTS
LOGAN BAKER AND OTHERS WHOSE WIT AND WISDOM WERE LOST TO HISTORY THROUGH THE ABSENCE OF REPORTERS
JAMES SHIELDS IT WAS NOT THE FIRST NOR THE LAST TIME THAT HE ACTED IN THIS CAPACITY
IT WOULD HARDLY BE POSSIBLE TO SELECT A BETTER HANDFUL OF CLASSICS FOR A YOUTH IN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES THAN THE FEW VOLUMES HE TURNED WITH A NIGHTLY AND DAILY HAND--THE BIBLE AESOP'S FABLES ROBINSON CRUSOE THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS A HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES AND WEEM'S LIFE OF WASHINGTON THESE WERE THE BEST AND THESE HE READ OVER AND OVER TILL HE KNEW THEM ALMOST BY HEART
THEIR MOTTO WAS SIC JURAT TRANSCENDERE MONTES AND WITH A WORLDLY WISDOM WHICH WAS SCARCELY CONSISTENT WITH THESE MEDIEVAL AFFECTATIONS TO PRESS UPON THE ATTENTION OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT THE BUILDING OF A LINE OF FRONTIER FORTS TO GUARD THE OHIO RIVER FROM THE FRENCH
THE COOLEST AND MOST JUDICIOUS OF HIS FRIENDS DENY THAT HIS DEPRESSION EVER WENT TO SUCH AN EXTREMITY
AS BETWEEN THESE TWO LINCOLN WOULD EASILY HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD NOT FIVE ANTI-NEBRASKA DEMOCRATS REFUSED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO VOTE FOR HIM OR ANY OTHER WHIG FOOTNOTE
THIS SECTIONAL CONTROVERSY OVER THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY IN ITS THREEFOLD ASPECT HAD BEGUN WITH THE VERY BIRTH OF THE NATION HAD CONTINUED WITH ITS GROWTH AND BECOME INTENSIFIED WITH ITS STRENGTH
YET THERE ARE MILLIONS STILL LIVING WHO SYMPATHIZED WITH HIM IN HIS NOBLE ASPIRATIONS WHO LABORED WITH HIM IN HIS TOILSOME LIFE AND WHOSE HEARTS WERE SADDENED BY HIS TRAGIC DEATH
SCATTERING 13
THE SNOW FELL IN HEAVY MASSES AS IF THROWN FROM A SCOOP-SHOVEL
THE CONSPIRATORS WERE SHREWD ENOUGH TO REALIZE THEIR VICTORY
AND THEREFORE THIRD THE COMMITTEE HAD ADHERED NOT ONLY TO THE SPIRIT BUT TO THE VERY PHRASEOLOGY OF THAT ADJUSTMENT AND REFUSED EITHER TO AFFIRM OR REPEAL THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE 4 RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END AND THEN GOING TO ILLINOIS SPOKE NIGHT AND DAY UNTIL THE ELECTION
FEBRUARY 22 1856 THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN CONGRESS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAD BEEN DEFINITELY ORGANIZED A FEW WEEKS BEFORE AT PITTSBURG NOW URGED THE IMMEDIATE RECEPTION OF THE TOPEKA CONSTITUTION AND THE ADMISSION OF KANSAS AS A FREE STATE CITING THE CASES OF MICHIGAN ARKANSAS FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA AS JUSTIFYING PRECEDENTS
THE VILLAGES WERE ILLUMINATED
JUDGES AND VOTERS OATHS WERE DECLARED UNNECESSARY OR EXPLAINED AWAY UPON NEWLY-INVENTED PHRASES AND ABSURD SUBTLETIES

IN SUCH A STATE OF THINGS IT WAS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT THE TECHNICALITIES OF LAW WERE HELD IN SOMEWHAT LESS VENERATION THAN WHAT THE PIONEER REGARDED AS THE ESSENTIAL CLAIMS OF JUSTICE

CASSIUS M
FIRST COLLISION WITH DOUGLAS
ONE OF THEM SAYS OF HIM WITH INJURIOUS PLEONASM THAT HE TALKED TOO MUCH WITH HIS MOUTH A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF HIS EXCESSIVE FLUENCY WAS SOON TO BE MADE DISAGREEABLY EVIDENT TO HIS CLERK
ALREADY THE UNION SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS WHISPERED THAT CASS WAS WILLING TO PROPOSE AND FAVOR SUCH A REPEAL IT WAS GIVEN OUT IN THE BALTIMORE SUN THAT CASS INTENDED TO SEPARATE THE SHEEP FROM THE GOATS BOTH STATEMENTS WERE UNTRUE
IN THE SOUTHERN STATES THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WELCOMED SUPPORTED AND DEFENDED THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE IT BEING CONSONANT WITH THEIR PRO-SLAVERY FEELINGS AND APPARENTLY FAVORABLE TO THEIR PRO-SLAVERY INTERESTS
YOU SAY MY WORDS IMPORTED INSULT I MEANT THEM AS A FAIR SET-OFF TO YOUR OWN STATEMENTS AND NOT OTHERWISE

IT LED TO DISPUTE CONTRADICTIONS AND FINALLY TO A FORMAL BANTER TO A WRESTLING-MATCH
TO SCHOOL HIMSELF TO ITS LOSS WITH BECOMING RESIGNATION TO WAIT HOPEFULLY DURING FOUR YEARS FOR ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN THE DANGEROUS AND DIFFICULT TASK OF PERSUADING HIS FRIENDS TO LEAVE THEIR OLD AND JOIN A NEW POLITICAL PARTY ONLY YET DIMLY FORESHADOWED TO WATCH THE CHANCES OF MAINTAINING HIS PARTY LEADERSHIP FURNISHED SUFFICIENT OCCUPATION FOR THE LEISURE AFFORDED BY THE NECESSITIES OF HIS LAW PRACTICE

I WRITE IT IN ORDER IF POSSIBLE TO GET YOU TO FACE THE TRUTH WHICH TRUTH IS YOU ARE DESTITUTE BECAUSE YOU HAVE IDLED AWAY ALL YOUR TIME
DOUGLAS AND HIS FRIENDS WERE DISCOMFITED BUT NOT DISMAYED
IT WAS REGARDED THEREFORE ALMOST AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT LINCOLN SHOULD BE A CANDIDATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE AT THE NEXT ELECTION WHICH TOOK PLACE IN AUGUST 1834
THIS ONE IS A DOUBTFUL WHIG
IT IS THE ALMOST UNBROKEN TESTIMONY OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES THAT BY VIRTUE OF CERTAIN HIGH TRAITS OF CHARACTER IN CERTAIN MOMENTOUS LINES OF PURPOSE AND ACHIEVEMENT HE WAS INCOMPARABLY THE GREATEST MAN OF HIS TIME
LINCOLN AFTERWARDS BUILT A COMFORTABLE HOUSE OF WOOD ON THE CORNER OF EIGHTH AND JACKSON STREETS WHERE HE LIVED UNTIL HE REMOVED TO THE WHITE HOUSE
HE WAS GREAT BOTH AT NISI PRIUS AND BEFORE AN APPELLATE TRIBUNAL
SHE DIED IN HER GIRLHOOD AND THOUGH THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN ANY ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THEM HE WAS PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED BY HER DEATH

DOUGLAS'S REAL ABILITY WAS AND REMAINS UNQUESTIONED
AND AS USUAL THE INTOLERANCE PRODUCED ITS NATURAL REACTION
WE HAVE THE WORD OF MR LINCOLN FOR IT THAT NO SUBSEQUENT SUCCESS EVER GAVE HIM SUCH UNMIXED PLEASURE AS THIS EARLIEST DISTINCTION
FOUR MILLIONS WERE ALSO VOTED TO COMPLETE THE CANAL
BUT IF WE LOOK A LITTLE CAREFULLY INTO THE STATE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC OPINION IN ILLINOIS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS CENTURY WE SHALL SEE HOW MUCH OF INFLEXIBLE CONSCIENCE AND REASON THERE WAS IN THIS SIMPLE PROTEST
DELAWARE CITY HOWEVER WAS NOT TO BE THUS EASILY CRUSHED
THEY PREDICTED NOTHING BUT RUIN TO A COUNTRY THAT THUS FORSOOK THE OLD WAYS WHICH WERE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEIR FATHERS BUT WITH THE CHANGE IN DRESS CAME OTHER ALTERATIONS WHICH WERE ALL FOR THE BETTER--A GROWING SELF-RESPECT AMONG THE YOUNG
THIS ELECTION OF A TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE WHICH AS THEN POPULARLY BELIEVED MIGHT DETERMINE BY THE ENACTMENT OF LAWS WHETHER KANSAS SHOULD BECOME A FREE OR A SLAVE STATE WAS PRECISELY THE COVETED OPPORTUNITY FOR WHICH THE BORDER RUFFIAN CONSPIRACY HAD BEEN ORGANIZED
STRENGTHENED ON BOTH SIDES WITH MEN MONEY ARMS AND SUPPLIES THE CONTEST WAS GRADUALLY RESUMED WITH THE OPENING SPRING
48-58 THE STRONGEST POINT HOWEVER MADE BY THE CONVENTION WAS A DETERMINATION STRICTLY ADHERED TO FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS TO TAKE NO PART IN ANY ELECTION UNDER THE BOGUS TERRITORIAL LAWS
WE HAVE ANTICIPATED A SCORE OF YEARS IN SPEAKING OF MR LINCOLN'S RELATIONS TO HIS FAMILY

THE BALANCE OF POWER ORIGIN OF THE SLAVERY STRUGGLE
WHO THAT LOOKS BUT FOR A MOMENT AT THEIR SWARTWOUTS THEIR PRICES THEIR HARRINGTONS AND THEIR HUNDREDS OF OTHERS SCAMPERING AWAY WITH THE PUBLIC MONEY TO TEXAS TO EUROPE AND TO EVERY SPOT OF THE EARTH WHERE A VILLAIN MAY HOPE TO FIND REFUGE FROM JUSTICE CAN AT ALL DOUBT THAT THEY ARE MOST DISTRESSINGLY AFFECTED IN THEIR HEELS WITH A SPECIES OF RUNNING ITCH
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SOME OF THE NORTHERN DEMOCRATS BEGAN TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS NEW LIBERTY
LUCK WAS AN ACTIVE DIVINITY IN THEIR APPREHENSION POWERFUL FOR BLESSING OR BANE ANNOUNCED BY HOMELY SIGNS TO BE PLACATED BY QUAINT CEREMONIES
THEY DID THIS FOR HIM SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS POPULAR--BECAUSE HE WAS LINCOLN
THE VAGUE AND DOUBLE-MEANING PHRASES OF THE LAWRENCE AGREEMENT FURNISHED THE EARLIEST CAUSES OF A RENEWAL OF THE QUARREL
THE NIGHT AFTER THE VOTE WAS TAKEN THEY FORMED IN A WILD AND DRUNKEN PROCESSION AND VISITED THE RESIDENCES OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE OTHER FREE-STATE LEADERS WITH LOUD AND INDECENT DEMONSTRATIONS OF TRIUMPH
APPENDIX CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 1851-2 P
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER HE OR THE COMMITTEE WERE INTIMIDATED ON ACCOUNT OF THE PLATFORMS OF 1852 TO WHICH MR GIDDINGS REPLIED THAT THE SOUTH LINE OF THE TERRITORY WAS 36 DEGREES 30 AND WAS ALREADY COVERED BY THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE PROHIBITION
SHANNON PROCLAMATION NOVEMBER 29 1855
WE IMMEDIATELY PULLED UP TO THEM AND WENT ON THE RAFT WHERE WE WERE MADE WELCOME BY VARIOUS DEMONSTRATIONS ESPECIALLY BY AN INVITATION TO A FEAST ON FISH CORN BREAD EGGS BUTTER AND COFFEE JUST PREPARED FOR OUR BENEFIT
AND A NOISY DISPERSAL NEXT DAY
THE REMAINING MEMBERS WERE UNDECIDED
INDEED MR HERNDON INSISTS THAN EVEN IN THEIR HOT YOUTH THEY SHOWED THE PROMISE OF GOODNESS AND PIETY
IT ORIGINATED PARTY FACTIONS POLITICAL SCHOOLS AND CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINES AND MADE AND MARRED THE FAME OF GREAT STATESMEN
WINTHROP JR IN HIS RECENT MEMOIR OF THE HON
THIS GAIN HOWEVER WAS PERHAPS MORE THAN NUMERICALLY COUNTERBALANCED BY THE ACTIVE IMPORTATION OF CAPTURED AFRICANS ESPECIALLY INTO SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA UP TO THE TIME THE TRAFFIC CEASED BY LAW IN 1808
BUT OFFUTT'S INDISCRETION HAD MADE IT NECESSARY FOR HIM TO SHOW HIS METTLE
IT RUN ITS IRON IN HIM THEN AND THERE MAY 1831
IN MANY CASES THOSE WHO APPARENTLY RECOVERED LINGERED FOR YEARS WITH HEALTH SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED
BROKEN BY IT I TOO MAY BE
THE CONSTITUTION OF ILLINOIS CONTAINED A CLAUSE DISQUALIFYING MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND CERTAIN OTHER DESIGNATED OFFICIALS FROM BEING ELECTED TO THE SENATE
HE NEVER CLAIMS A PLACE AS SUBJECT TO HIS DISPOSITION
LINDER ONCE SAID TO AN EASTERN LAWYER WHO EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT LINCOLN WAS WASTING HIS TIME IN TELLING STORIES TO THE JURY DON'T LAY THAT FLATTERING UNCTION TO YOUR SOUL
THE WHIG PARTY HOWEVER HAVING CARRIED TWO SLAVE STATES FOR SCOTT IN 1852 AND HOLDING A STRONG MINORITY IN THE REMAINDER WAS NOT SO UNANIMOUS
317 THIS IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE PORTRAIT OF A GREAT LAWYER DRAWN BY COMPETENT HANDS WITH THE LIFELONG HABIT OF CONSCIENTIOUS ACCURACY
MY AMENDMENT SEEMED TO TAKE THE SENATE BY SURPRISE AND NO ONE APPEARED MORE STARTLED THAN JUDGE DOUGLAS HIMSELF
THE SIXTH SUBMITS THIS BILL ITSELF TO A POPULAR VOTE IN THE DISTRICT AS A CONDITION OF ITS PROMULGATION AS LAW
AT LAST ONE CAPTAIN VINCENT BOGUE OF SPRINGFIELD DETERMINED TO SHOW THAT THE THING COULD BE DONE BY DOING IT
BUT LINCOLN SEEMED ESPECIALLY CHOSEN TO THE KEENEST SUFFERING IN SUCH A CONJUNCTURE
MAJOR STUART WHOM WE HAVE MET IN THE BLACK HAWK WAR ONCE COMMANDING A BATTALION AND THEN MARCHING AS A PRIVATE
IT IS NOT PROBABLE HOWEVER THAT IN THIS COURSE THE SOUTH ACTED WITH ANY MENTAL RESERVATION OR SINISTER MOTIVE
IF BEATEN AS GENERALLY HAPPENED THE DEFEAT HAD NO PERSONAL SIGNIFICANCE
LITTLE DID EITHER DREAM WHILE ENGAGED IN THIS WORK THAT THE DAY WOULD COME WHEN THE APPEARANCE OF JOHN HANKS IN A PUBLIC MEETING WITH TWO OF THESE RAILS ON HIS SHOULDER WOULD ELECTRIFY A STATE CONVENTION AND KINDLE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY A CONTAGIOUS AND PASSIONATE ENTHUSIASM WHOSE RESULTS WOULD REACH TO ENDLESS GENERATIONS
HE CANNOT WAIT TO HEAR THE NEWS FROM HIS FRIEND BUT WRITES TO HIM ABOUT THE TIME OF THE WEDDING ADMITTING THAT HE IS WRITING IN THE DARK THAT WORDS FROM A BACHELOR MAY BE WORTHLESS TO A BENEDICK BUT STILL UNABLE TO KEEP SILENCE
THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE THE PLACE THEREFORE UNLESS IT BECAME CLEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR EITHER OF THE OTHERS TO GET IT
TO RECTIFY A MISREPRESENTATION WHICH HE COULD NOT IN HIS VERY NATURE PERMIT TO GO UNCONTRADICTED
HERE'S MINE
ON SUCH OCCASIONS NEIGHBORLY SENTIMENT AND COMITY REQUIRED EVERY MAN TO DROP HIS AXE OR UNHITCH FROM THE PLOW IN THE FURROW TO FURTHER THE REAL OR IMAGINARY WEAL OF THE COMMUNITY
THE MONEY BURNED IN HIS HANDS UNTIL HE LOCKED THE SHOP AND STARTED ON A WALK OF SEVERAL MILES IN THE NIGHT TO MAKE RESTITUTION BEFORE HE SLEPT
NOT KNOWING BUT THAT THIS INDICATED MERELY A MAGNANIMOUS DESIRE TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE FOR ESCAPE HE PERSISTED IN HIS OFFER AND SHE IN HER REFUSAL
AMONG THE OFFICERS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT WAS A YOUNG IRISHMAN NAMED JAMES SHIELDS WHO OWED HIS POST AS AUDITOR IN GREAT MEASURE TO THAT ALIEN VOTE TO GAIN WHICH THE DEMOCRATS HAD OVERTURNED THE SUPREME COURT
ONE BANKER AND ONE BROKER AFTER ANOTHER TO WHOSE HANDS THEY HAD BEEN RECKLESSLY CONFIDED IN NEW YORK AND LONDON FAILED OR MADE AWAY WITH THE PROCEEDS OF SALES
26 1831 THE VEHEMENCE WITH WHICH THE EARLY ANTISLAVERY APOSTLES WERE CONDUCTING THEIR AGITATION IN THE EAST NATURALLY ROUSED A CORRESPONDING VIOLENCE OF EXPRESSION IN EVERY OTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY
COMMENTING ON THESE PROPOSITIONS TWO DAYS LATER THE ADMINISTRATION ORGAN THE WASHINGTON UNION DECLARED THEY WERE BOTH FALSE LIGHTS TO BE AVOIDED BY ALL GOOD DEMOCRATS
NOMINATION OF TAYLOR FOR PRESIDENT
THERE WAS AN UTTER ABSENCE OF THE ABSTRUSE QUESTIONS AND COMPLICATIONS WHICH NOW BESET THE LAW
THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF THE EARNESTNESS OF THEIR PURPOSE
JUDGE LOGAN TOOK HIS SON DAVID--AFTERWARDS A WELL-KNOWN POLITICIAN AND LAWYER OF OREGON--INTO HIS OFFICE AND LINCOLN OPENED ONE OF HIS OWN INTO WHICH HE SOON INVITED A YOUNG BRIGHT AND ENTHUSIASTIC MAN NAMED WILLIAM HENRY HERNDON WHO REMAINED HIS PARTNER AS LONG AS LINCOLN LIVED
HIS WIFE WAS ONLY A HELPMATE
PRESIDENT LINCOLN GAVE IT HIS SANCTION AND PROMISED HIS CORDIAL COOPERATION
A LONG AND DRAGGING DEBATE ENSUED OF WHICH NO RECORD HAS BEEN PRESERVED
GENERAL HENRY ATKINSON COMMANDING THE UNITED STATES TROOPS SENT A FORMAL SUMMONS TO BLACK HAWK TO RETURN
THE PRESIDENT WAS KNOWN TO BE RIGIDLY OPPOSED TO THE RECEPTION OF VISITS ON SUNDAY FOR THE DISCUSSION OF ANY POLITICAL SUBJECT
AT THE ELECTION OF OCTOBER 1 1855 IN WHICH THE FREE-STATE MEN TOOK NO PART WHITFIELD FOR DELEGATE RECEIVED 2721 VOTES BORDER RUFFIANS INCLUDED
SARAH BUSH LINCOLN AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY-SIX THOMAS LINCOLN JOINED THE BAPTIST CHURCH AT LITTLE PIGEON IN 1823
AFTER SHIELDS RETURNED FROM THE MEXICAN WAR WITH HIS LAURELS STILL GREEN AND AT THE CLOSE OF THE CANVASS WHICH HAD MADE HIM SENATOR HE WROTE AN INCREDIBLE LETTER TO JUDGE BREESE HIS PRINCIPAL COMPETITOR IN WHICH HE COMMITTED THE GRATUITOUS FOLLY OF INFORMING HIM THAT HE HAD SWORN IN HIS HEART IF BREESE HAD BEEN ELECTED THAT HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE PROFITED BY HIS SUCCESS
HOLLAND RELATES A SEQUEL TO THIS OFFICIAL EXPERIENCE WHICH ILLUSTRATES THE QUAINT HONESTY OF THE MAN
WHILE THEY WERE TOGETHER HE WAS CONSTANT IN HIS ATTENTIONS AND WHEN HE WAS AT VANDALIA OR AT SPRINGFIELD HE CONTINUED HIS ASSIDUITIES IN SOME OF THE MOST SINGULAR LOVE-LETTERS EVER WRITTEN
AN ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE A CONDITION TO THESE NEGOTIATIONS THAT SLAVERY SHOULD NEVER EXIST IN ANY TERRITORY TO BE THUS ACQUIRED WAS THE FAMOUS WILMOT PROVISO
BUT THEY WERE NOT DEFICIENT IN ABILITY IN LEARNING OR IN THAT MOST VALUABLE FACULTY WHICH ENABLES REALLY INTELLIGENT MEN TO GET THEIR BEARINGS AND SUSTAIN THEMSELVES IN EVERY SPHERE OF LIFE TO WHICH THEY MAY BE CALLED
AMONG OTHER INSTRUMENTALITIES FOR EXECUTING THE BOGUS LAWS THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE HAD APPOINTED ONE SAMUEL J
TO WRITE THE LIFE OF THIS GREAT AMERICAN IN SUCH A WAY AS TO SHOW HIS RELATIONS TO THE TIMES IN WHICH HE MOVED THE STUPENDOUS ISSUES HE CONTROLLED THE REMARKABLE MEN BY WHOM HE WAS SURROUNDED HAS BEEN THE PURPOSE WHICH THE AUTHORS HAVE DILIGENTLY PURSUED FOR MANY YEARS
THE DISCIPLINE OF BOTH PARTIES WAS MORE OR LESS RELAXED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE SLAVERY QUESTION
THROUGH A LONG LIFE OF SOMEWHAT CONSPICUOUS PUBLIC SERVICE HE NEVER LOST A CERTAIN TONE OF ABSURDITY WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE QUALITIES WE HAVE MENTIONED
ALL WILL BE HARMONY A FEW DAYS LATER THIS PREDICTION WAS REALIZED
THE NORTH THEREFORE STILL HAD AN IMPERIAL AREA FROM WHICH TO ORGANIZE FUTURE FREE STATES WHILE THE SOUTH HAD NOT A FOOT MORE TERRITORY FROM WHICH TO CREATE SLAVE STATES
WHEN THE WHITE MAN GOVERNS HIMSELF THAT IS SELF GOVERNMENT
ALL ACCOUNTS REPRESENT HER AS A HANDSOME YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY-THREE OF APPEARANCE AND INTELLECT SUPERIOR TO HER LOWLY FORTUNES
AT A MOST UNFORTUNATE TIME FOR THEM THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK OF THAT NATIVE FANATICISM WHICH REAPPEARS FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR POLITICS WITH THE PERIODICITY OF MALARIAL FEVERS AND ALWAYS TO THE PROFIT OF THE PARTY AGAINST WHICH ITS EFFORTS ARE AIMED
IT PROHIBITED SLAVERY BUT MADE REASONABLE PROVISION FOR EXISTING PROPERTY-RIGHTS IN SLAVES ACTUALLY IN THE TERRITORY
HE WENT UP TO RADFORD AND PERSUADED HIM TO LEAVE THE POLLS WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY
HE FOUND AND STRUCK THE ENEMY AT BAY ON THE BLUFFS OF THE WISCONSIN RIVER ON THE 21ST OF JULY AND INFLICTED UPON THEM A SIGNAL DEFEAT
THE POLITICAL AIR OF WASHINGTON WAS HEAVY WITH CLOUDS AND MUTTERINGS AND CLANS WERE GATHERING FOR AND AGAINST THE OMINOUS PROPOSITION
I MAY BE WRONG IN REGARD TO ANY OR ALL OF THEM
NOW IS THE TIME TO SHOW GAME AND IF WE ARE DEFEATED THIS TIME THE TERRITORY IS LOST TO THE SOUTH SAID THE LEADERS
THE STRUGGLES OF HIS YOUTH WHICH WERE SO EASY TO HIS ACTIVE BRAIN AND HIS MIGHTY MUSCLES ALL BEHIND HIM AND THE TITANIC LABORS OF HIS MANHOOD YET TO COME
BUT AS A RULE THE MEN WALKED AND THE WOMEN WENT ON HORSEBACK WITH THE LITTLE CHILDREN IN THEIR ARMS
CHAPTER XI MARRIAGE THE FOREGOING LETTER BRINGS US TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A REMARKABLE PASSAGE IN LINCOLN'S LIFE
WHY SUCH A PRODIGIOUS EFFORT WAS DEEMED NECESSARY TO OVERCOME THE VOTES AND INFLUENCE OF THIS PALTRY HANDFUL OF PAUPERS WHO HAD SOLD THEMSELVES TO ELI THAYER AND CO WAS NEVER EXPLAINED
WHEN THE TIME ARRIVED HOWEVER FOR LEAVING OFF GRIMACING AND POSTURING AND THE HOUSE WENT TO VOTING THE ADVOCATES OF SLAVERY USUALLY CARRIED THE DAY AS THE SOUTH WHIGS AND DEMOCRATS TOGETHER VOTED SOLIDLY AND THE NORTH WAS DIVIDED
HERNDON TO THE KEYES-LINCOLN MEMORIAL COLLECTION
THE MOST WE CAN SAY FOR MR LINCOLN IS THAT HE OBEYED THE WILL OF HIS CONSTITUENTS AS HE PROMISED TO DO AND LABORED WITH SINGULAR SKILL AND ABILITY TO ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECTS DESIRED BY THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE HIM THEIR VOTES
IT MAY ALMOST BE SAID THAT LINCOLN'S PRACTICE AS A LAWYER BEGINS FROM THIS TIME
TO GUARD MORE EFFECTUALLY AGAINST CLERICAL ERRORS THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED
AN OLD FARMER OF SANGAMON COUNTY STILL TALKS OF A FEATHERBED WEIGHING FIFTY-FOUR POUNDS WITH WHICH HIS WIFE MADE HIM SWIM SIX RIVERS UNDER PENALTY OF DESERTION
BUT COMPARED WITH GENTRYVILLE AND NEW SALEM THE SOCIETY WHICH ASSEMBLED IN THE WINTER AT THAT LITTLE CAPITAL WAS POLISHED AND ELEGANT
AUDITOR'S WARRANTS WERE SELLING AT HALF THEIR NOMINAL VALUE
THE OLD PARTNERS CONTINUED CLOSE AND INTIMATE FRIENDS
NOR WERE THE WHIGS FEW IN NUMBER OR LAGGARD IN THE DAY OF DANGER
THE PEOPLE OF LAWRENCE WITHOUT ANY GREAT DIFFICULTY OBTAINED DAILY INFORMATION CONCERNING THE HOSTILE CAMPS
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END THE ENGAGEMENT WAS NOT IN ALL RESPECTS A HAPPY ONE AS BOTH PARTIES DOUBTED THEIR COMPATIBILITY AND A HEART SO AFFECTIONATE AND A CONSCIENCE SO SENSITIVE AS LINCOLN'S FOUND MATERIAL FOR EXQUISITE SELF-TORMENT IN THESE CONDITIONS
AND WE DO FURTHER AGREE THAT THE SAID COUNTY-SEAT BE CALLED AND KNOWN BY THE NAME OF SPRINGFIELD IN THIS MANNER THE FUTURE CAPITAL RECEIVED THAT HACKNEYED TITLE WHEN THE DISTINCTIVE AND MUSICAL NAME OF SANGAMON WAS READY TO THEIR HANDS
THE SUBJECT OF YOUR LETTER IS EXCEEDINGLY PAINFUL TO ME
A GLANCE AT THE MAP WILL SHOW HOW EASILY LOCAL SENTIMENT COULD INFLUENCE OR DOMINATE COMMERCE AND TRAVEL ON THE MISSOURI RIVER
HE WAS THE SON OF ONE OF THE PIONEERS OF THE WEST AND GREW UP IN THE RUDEST REGIONS OF THE BORDER LAND BETWEEN TENNESSEE AND KENTUCKY
THE CONDITION OF THE ABOVE OBLIGATION IS SUCH THAT WHEREAS THERE IS A MARRIAGE SHORTLY INTENDED BETWEEN THE ABOVE BOUND THOMAS LINCOLN AND NANCY HANKS FOR WHICH A LICENSE HAS ISSUED NOW IF THERE BE NO LAWFUL CAUSE TO OBSTRUCT THE SAID MARRIAGE THEN THIS OBLIGATION TO BE VOID ELSE TO REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND VIRTUE IN LAW
AT THE ELECTION FOR MEMBERS OF THE TOPEKA CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION A WEEK LATER FROM WHICH THE PRO-SLAVERY MEN ABSTAINED THE FREE-STATE MEN CAST 2710 VOTES WHILE REEDER THEIR NOMINEE FOR DELEGATE RECEIVED 2849
4TH
TO THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS COURT FOR THE COUNTY OF SANGAMON AT ITS JUNE TERM 1834
AND IN THE DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS WE HAVE CITED WE HAVE USED INCESSANT CARE TO SECURE AUTHENTICITY
AT THE HAZARD OF WEARING THIS POINT THREADBARE I WILL RELATE AN ANECDOTE WHICH SEEMS TO BE TOO STRIKINGLY IN POINT TO BE OMITTED
THE FIRM DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE OF LAWRENCE HAD PRODUCED ITS EFFECT
THIS IS IMPORTANT IF IN NOTHING ELSE IN SHOWING WHICH WAY THE WIND BLOWS GENERAL TAYLOR'S CHANCES FOR ELECTION HAD BEEN GREATLY INCREASED BY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION A FORTNIGHT BEFORE
BUT HE MAKES IN HIS MEMOIRS THIS CURIOUS REFLECTION WHICH WOULD SEEM LIKE AFFECTATION IN ONE LESS PERFECTLY AND SIMPLY HEROIC
AND I THINK IT IS NOT PROBABLE ANY ONE WOULD DESIRE TO REMOVE FROM A DISTANCE TO TAKE IT WE HAVE EXAMINED A LARGE NUMBER OF HIS RECOMMENDATIONS--FOR WITH A COMPLETE CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATION THERE WOULD NATURALLY BE GREAT ACTIVITY AMONG THE OFFICE-SEEKERS--AND THEY ARE ALL IN PRECISELY THE SAME VEIN
IT HAD A POPULATION OF 1500
HE ONCE ASKED AN OLD FRIEND TO GIVE HIM A RECOMMENDATION TO SOME STEAMBOAT ON THE OHIO BUT DESISTED FROM HIS PURPOSE ON BEING REMINDED THAT HIS FATHER HAD THE RIGHT TO DISPOSE OF HIS TIME FOR A YEAR OR SO MORE
SINCE THEN IT SEEMS TO ME I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY HAPPY BUT FOR THE NEVER-ABSENT IDEA THAT THERE IS ONE STILL UNHAPPY WHOM I HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO MAKE SO
BUT THEY COULD NOT ALL AT ONCE TAKE FROM THE BAR OF THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT ITS RACINESS AND ITS INDIVIDUALITY
LET NORTH AND SOUTH--LET ALL AMERICANS--LET ALL LOVERS OF LIBERTY EVERYWHERE--JOIN IN THE GREAT AND GOOD WORK
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE 2 RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END THE STAPLE ARGUMENT AGAINST THE TOPEKA FREE-STATE MOVEMENT THAT IT WAS A REBELLION AGAINST CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY THOUGH PERHAPS CORRECT AS A MERE THEORY WAS UTTERLY REFUTED BY THE PRACTICAL FACTS OF THE CASE
IN THE REACTION WHICH SUCCEEDED THE TRIUMPH OF THE ANTISLAVERY PARTY IT SEEMED AS IF THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY ANTISLAVERY SENTIMENT IN THE STATE
AT THIS PLACE AND AT THE NEIGHBORING TOWN OF WESTPORT MISSOURI ONLY FOUR MILES DISTANT A MAJORITY OF THE PERSONS CLAIMING TO HAVE BEEN ELECTED NOW ASSEMBLED AND BECAME CLAMOROUS FOR THEIR CERTIFICATES
DAWSON 1370
IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT THE TERRITORY INCLUDED IN THIS TREATY CEDING LOUISIANA MUST BE FOREVER FREE UNLESS THE LAW BE REPEALED WITH THIS EXPLICIT UNDERSTANDING FROM A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE APPARENTLY ACCEPTED AS CONCLUSIVE BY THE WHOLE HOUSE AND CERTAINLY NOT OBJECTED TO BY THE CHAIRMAN MR RICHARDSON WHO WAS CAREFULLY WATCHING THE CURRENT OF DEBATE THE BILL PASSED ON THE 10TH NINETY-EIGHT YEAS TO FORTY-THREE NAYS
I GO FOR ALL SHARING THE PRIVILEGES OF THE GOVERNMENT WHO ASSIST IN BEARING ITS BURDENS
AND THIRD A POLITICAL STRUGGLE FOR THE BALANCE OF POWER IN GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY BY WHICH THE SECURITY AND PERPETUITY OF THE INSTITUTION MIGHT BE GUARANTEED
THE ADMINISTRATION OF GENERAL TAYLOR APPARENTLY FEELING THAT SOME COMPENSATION WAS DUE TO ONE SO EARNESTLY RECOMMENDED BY THE LEADING WHIGS OF THE STATE OFFERED MR LINCOLN THE GOVERNORSHIP OF OREGON
LOGAN STUART BROWNING DUBOIS HARDIN BREESE AND MANY OTHERS
THE CONVENTION SYSTEM WAS AFTERWARDS SEEN TO BE AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY TO PREVENT THE DISORGANIZATION OF PARTIES THROUGH THE RESTLESS VANITY OF OBSCURE AND INSUBORDINATE ASPIRANTS
ANY MENTION OF THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY WAS THOUGHT IN THE WORST POSSIBLE TASTE AND NO ONE COULD AVOW HIMSELF OPPOSED TO IT WITHOUT THE RISK OF SOCIAL OSTRACISM
HIS INTENTION WAS TO DISCUSS THE PRINCIPLES OF THE NEBRASKA BILL
FOUR HUNDRED ACRES ON LONG RUN A BRANCH OF FLOYD'S FORK IN JEFFERSON COUNTY ENTERED MAY 29 1780 AND SURVEYED MAY 7 1785
THEN THERE WERE LONG REACHES OF WILDERNESS BEFORE YOU CAME TO FORT DEARBORN WHERE THERE WAS NOTHING AS YET TO GIVE PROMISE OF THAT MIRACULOUS GROWTH WHICH WAS SOON TO MAKE CHICAGO A PROVERB TO THE WORLD
CHAPTER X EARLY LAW PRACTICE DURING ALL THE YEARS OF HIS SERVICE IN THE LEGISLATURE LINCOLN WAS PRACTICING LAW IN SPRINGFIELD IN THE DINGY LITTLE OFFICE AT THE CORNER OF THE SQUARE
AT THE APPEARANCE OF THIS PROCLAMATION PLATTE COUNTY TOOK ALARM AND HELD A MEETING ON THE KANSAS SIDE OF THE RIVER TO INTIMIDATE HIM WITH VIOLENT SPEECHES AND A SIGNIFICANT MEMORIAL
THIS LETTER WAS DATED AT THE HERMITAGE NEAR NASHVILLE TENNESSEE FEB
29 THE PREDICTION WAS LITERALLY FULFILLED
HE MADE AN ACTIVE CANVASS AND SPOKE FREQUENTLY DURING THE SUMMER
YOUR REQUEST FOR EIGHTY DOLLARS I DO NOT THINK IT BEST TO COMPLY WITH NOW
THE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS BOLDLY NOMINATING MR RICHARDSON THE HOUSE LEADER ON THE NEBRASKA BILL AS THEIR CANDIDATE FOR SPEAKER MADE A LONG AND DETERMINED PUSH FOR SUCCESS
THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF LINCOLN IN THE CANVASS WAS IN A JUDICIOUS ATTEMPT TO CHECK THIS UNREASONABLE PANIC
AN INDUSTRY AND THRIFT BY WHICH THEY COULD BUY GOOD CLOTHES
OUT OF THIS INCIDENT THE OFFICIOUS SHERIFF MANAGED MOST INGENIOUSLY TO CREATE AN EMBROILMENT WITH THE TOWN OF LAWRENCE BUCKLEY WHO WAS ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN ACCESSORY TO THE CRIME OBTAINED A PEACE-WARRANT AGAINST BRANSON A NEIGHBOR OF THE VICTIM
THEIR HOSTILITY GREW OPEN AND DEFIANT
THEY HAD COME TO CENTRAL ILLINOIS ABOUT THE SAME TIME AND HAD IN A MEASURE GROWN UP TOGETHER
COVERING THE RICH ALLUVIAL LANDS ALONG THE MAJESTIC BUT ERRATIC STREAM LAY THE HEAVY SLAVE COUNTIES OF THE STATE WEALTHY FROM THE VALUABLE SLAVE PRODUCTS OF HEMP AND TOBACCO

LINCOLN ON THE CIRCUIT
ENGAGED IN USEFUL AND CONGENIAL TOIL
THEY GREW VERY DEXTEROUS IN AVOIDING ANY COMMITMENT AS TO THE LEGAL OR MORAL BEARINGS OF THE QUESTIONS BROUGHT BEFORE THEM
THOUGH THEY HAD DEFIANT AND TURBULENT SPIRITS IN THEIR OWN RANKS WHO OFTEN ACCUSED THEM OF IMBECILITY AND COWARDICE THEY MAINTAINED A STEADY POLICY OF NON-RESISTANCE AND UNDER EVERY SHOW OF FEDERAL AUTHORITY IN SUPPORT OF THE BOGUS LAWS THEY SUBMITTED TO OBNOXIOUS SEARCHES AND SEIZURES TO CAPRICIOUS ARREST AND PAINFUL IMPRISONMENT RATHER THAN BY RESISTANCE TO PLACE THEMSELVES IN THE ATTITUDE OF DELIBERATE OUTLAWS
IN THE EARLY LIFE OF LINCOLN THESE UNWHOLESOME PHYSICAL CONDITIONS WERE ESPECIALLY PREVALENT
ARRIVING AT THE PLACE OF MEETING WHICH WAS SOME LOG CABIN IF THE WEATHER WAS FOUL OR THE SHADE OF A TREE IF IT WAS FAIR THE ASSEMBLED WORSHIPERS THREW THEIR PROVISIONS INTO A COMMON STORE AND PICNICKED IN NEIGHBORLY COMPANIONSHIP
IN THE ONE IT MIGHT BE MERE ENTHUSIASM AND AN IMPETUOUS TEMPERAMENT
HE WAS A MAN OF RESPECTABLE ABILITIES WHO THEN AND LONG AFTERWARDS HELD A SOMEWHAT PROMINENT POSITION AMONG THE PUBLIC MEN OF HIS STATE
THE PROGRESSIVE AND RADICAL SPIRIT OF THE CONVENTION IS ILLUSTRATED IN ITS ENDORSEMENT OF THE FREE-STATE MOVEMENT AGAINST THE REPORT OF ITS OWN COMMITTEE
BETWEEN THE MEN LIKE COLES AND THE MEN LIKE GRAMMAR THERE WAS A WIDE INTERVAL AND THE AVERAGE WAS ABOUT WHAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE DESERVED AND COULD APPRECIATE
HE WAS NOT WITHOUT MEANS OF HIS OWN
EVERY MAN IS SAID TO HAVE HIS PECULIAR AMBITION
WRITING TO SPEED ABOUT IT AFTER THE LAPSE OF FOURTEEN YEARS HE SAYS
WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY IN WRONG AND CRIME AS WELL AS IN HONEST PURPOSE AND DEED
THEY WERE IN THE HUMOR TO AVENGE THEMSELVES BY A DISPLAY OF INDEPENDENCE ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
HE WAS APPOINTED THE WASHINGTON UNION NAIVELY STATED WHEN THE MATTER WAS FIRST CALLED IN QUESTION UNDER THE STRONGEST ASSURANCE THAT HE WAS STRICTLY AND HONESTLY A NATIONAL MAN
THE EARLY ILLINOISANS WERE PERPLEXED WITH A SECRET AND SINGULAR SENSE OF INFERIORITY TO EVEN SO NEW AND RAW A COMMUNITY AS MISSOURI BECAUSE OF ITS POSSESSION OF SLAVERY
THE TRAVESTY OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTION IS TOO SERIOUS FOR RIDICULE
AND THE ROADS AS FAST AS THEY WERE BUILT COULD BE OPERATED AT A GREAT PROFIT TO PAY FOR THEIR OWN CONSTRUCTION
THE DIVISION OF TOPICS BETWEEN US HAS BEEN SOMETIMES FOR LONG PERIODS SOMETIMES ALMOST FOR ALTERNATE CHAPTERS
THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO DOUBT OR MISGIVING IN THE MIND OF LINCOLN AS TO THAT FUTURE WHICH IF HE COULD HAVE FORESEEN IT WOULD HAVE PRESENTED SO MUCH OF TERRIBLE FASCINATION
COMPARING IT WITH HIS LATER SPEECHES WE FIND IT TO CONTAIN NOT ONLY THE ARGUMENT OF THE HOUR BUT THE PREMONITION OF THE BROADER ISSUES INTO WHICH THE NEW STRUGGLE WAS DESTINED SOON TO EXPAND
THIS WAS ITS GRAVEST CRIME
YET HE WAS USUALLY SELF-RELIANT DEPENDING ON HIS OWN RESOURCES AND RARELY CONSULTING HIS BROTHER LAWYERS EITHER ON THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS CASE OR ON THE LEGAL QUESTIONS INVOLVED
THE SONS OF THE PROMINENT WHIGS ENLISTED AS PRIVATE SOLDIERS
I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF THIS EVER SINCE AND CANNOT BUT THINK SUCH A NOTION IS UTTERLY FOOLISH
BUT THE COURSE OF THE BORDER RUFFIANS CREATED IN LESS THAN SIX WEEKS A POWERFUL AND DETERMINED OPPOSITION WHICH BECAME UNITED IN SUPPORT OF WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE TOPEKA CONSTITUTION
GIDDING'S DIARY JANUARY 8 9 AND 11 1849
HE WAS ALSO THE SAME WHO THREE YEARS LATER RECEIVED THE SOBRIQUET OF JOHN CANDLEBOX CALHOUN HAVING ACQUIRED UNENVIABLE NOTORIETY FROM HIS REPUTED CONNECTION WITH THE CINCINNATI DIRECTORY AND CANDLEBOX ELECTION FRAUDS IN KANSAS AND WITH THE FAMOUS LECOMPTON CONSTITUTION
LATER IN THE SUMMER JOSHUA B

THE VICES AND VIRTUES OF THE PIONEERS WERE SUCH AS PROCEEDED FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT
AND ILLUMINATING HIS PROUD EMINENCE AS ORATOR STATESMAN AND RULER THERE WOULD FOREVER SHINE AROUND HIS MEMORY THE HALO OF THAT TENDER HUMANITY AND CHRISTIAN CHARITY IN WHICH HE WALKED AMONG HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AS THEIR FAMILIAR COMPANION AND FRIEND
IT WAS NOT THAT HIS PECUNIARY CIRCUMSTANCES WERE MATERIALLY IMPROVED
THERE HE HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE BEST PEOPLE THE SETTLEMENT CONTAINED AND AMONG THEM HAD BECOME MUCH ATTACHED TO A YOUNG GIRL NAMED ANN RUTLEDGE THE DAUGHTER OF ONE OF THE PROPRIETORS OF THE PLACE
THEY OCCUPIED MUCH THE SAME RELATION TO THEM AS THE TRAMP TO THE HOUSEWIFE OF TO-DAY
THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO CAME AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME WITH THE PIONEER LINCOLN WAS SUFFICIENT TO LAY THE BASIS OF A SORT OF SOCIAL ORDER
IF SUCH INFLICTIONS AS THE FOREGOING MIGHT PERHAPS BE TOLERATED UPON THE PLEA THAT A BARBAROUS INSTITUTION REQUIRED BARBAROUS SAFEGUARDS WHAT OUGHT TO BE SAID OF THE LAST THREE SECTIONS OF THE ACT WHICH IN CONTEMPT OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES ANNULLED THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND INVADED EVEN THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE
WITHIN THAT PERIOD MANY THOUSANDS OF NEGRO CAPTIVES HAD BEEN ADDED TO THE POPULATION OF THE SOUTH BY DIRECT IMPORTATION AND NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND SLAVE INHABITANTS ADDED BY THE ACQUISITION OF LOUISIANA HASTENING THE FORMATION OF NEW SLAVE STATES SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER IN DUE PROPORTION TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE
ALL PREVIOUS ACCOUNTS GIVE THE DATE OF THIS MARRIAGE AS SEPTEMBER 23D
WE WANT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE TERRITORY OF NEBRASKA NOT MERELY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO RESIDE THERE BUT ALSO FOR THE PROTECTION OF OREGON AND CALIFORNIA IN TIME OF WAR AND THE PROTECTION OF OUR COMMERCE AND THE FIFTY OR SIXTY THOUSAND EMIGRANTS WHO ANNUALLY CROSS THE PLAINS HE ADDED THAT ITS LIMITS WERE PURPOSELY MADE LARGE TO EMBRACE THE GREAT LINES OF TRAVEL TO OREGON NEW MEXICO AND CALIFORNIA

AND AFTER THE MAINE ELECTION WAS OVER WITH ITS AUGURY OF TRIUMPH EVERY WHIG WHO WAS ABLE TO SING OR EVEN TO MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE WAS ROARING THE INQUIRY OH HAVE YOU HEARD HOW OLD MAINE WENT AND THE PROFANE BUT POWERFULLY ACCENTED RESPONSE SHE WENT HELL-BENT FOR GOVERNOR KENT AND TIPPECANOE AND TYLER TOO IT WAS ONE OF THE BUSIEST AND MOST ENJOYABLE SEASONS OF LINCOLN'S LIFE

IT SEEMS SINGULAR TO US OF A LATER DAY THAT JUST EIGHT PROMINENT MEN ON A SIDE SHOULD HAVE OFFERED THEMSELVES FOR THESE PLACES WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF ANY PRIMARY MEETINGS
WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY GRATIFYING TO HIM WAS THE FACT THAT HE RECEIVED THE ALMOST UNANIMOUS VOTE OF HIS OWN NEIGHBORHOOD THE PRECINCT OF NEW SALEM 277 VOTES AGAINST 3 A RESULT WHICH SHOWED MORE STRONGLY THAN ANY WORDS COULD DO THE EXTENT OF THE ATTACHMENT AND THE CONFIDENCE WHICH HIS GENIAL AND UPRIGHT CHARACTER HAD INSPIRED AMONG THOSE WHO KNEW HIM BEST

IT WOULD BE UNWISE TO REFUSE A PERMANENT ACQUISITION WHICH WILL EXIST AS LONG AS THE GLOBE REMAINS ON ACCOUNT OF A TEMPORARY INSTITUTION MR CLAY DOES NOT IN THIS LETTER DISCLAIM OR DISAVOW ANY SENTIMENTS PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED
WE HAVE IN NO CASE RELIED UPON OUR OWN MEMORY OF THE EVENTS NARRATED THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE PASSED UNDER OUR OWN EYES
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEAT OR GREATLY TO DELAY THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS AND ALTHOUGH THOSE WHO OPPOSED IT BUT OBEYED THE DICTATES OF COMMON MORALITY THEY WERE FIGHTING A BATTLE BEYOND ORDINARY HUMAN POWERS
THE NAME OF SANGAMON IS SAID TO MEAN IN THE POTTAWATOMIE LANGUAGE LAND OF PLENTY ITS CITIZENS WERE OF AN EXCELLENT CLASS OF PEOPLE A LARGE MAJORITY OF THEM FROM KENTUCKY THOUGH REPRESENTATIVES WERE NOT WANTING FROM THE EASTERN STATES MEN OF EDUCATION AND CHARACTER
QUARREL NOT AT ALL
IF WE GAINED NOTHING ELSE BY OUR LONG ASSOCIATION WITH MR LINCOLN WE HOPE AT LEAST THAT WE ACQUIRED FROM HIM THE HABIT OF JUDGING MEN AND EVENTS WITH CANDOR AND IMPARTIALITY
THESE ARE MY SENTIMENTS AND POLITICAL PRINCIPLES NOTHING COULD BE MORE UNQUALIFIED OR OUTSPOKEN THAN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS ADHESION TO WHAT WAS THEN AND FOR YEARS AFTERWARDS CALLED THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF HENRY CLAY
LINCOLN BECAME A MEMBER OF CAPTAIN ELIJAH ILES'S COMPANY OF MOUNTED VOLUNTEERS SOMETIMES CALLED THE INDEPENDENT SPY BATTALION AN ORGANIZATION UNIQUE OF ITS KIND IF WE MAY JUDGE FROM THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY ONE OF ITS TROOPERS
A DESPERATE EFFORT WAS THEN MADE BY THE PRO-SLAVERY MEMBERS TO KILL THE BILL FOR THE PURPOSE OF DESTROYING THE AMENDMENT WITH IT
AS THE AVOWED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RESTLESS AND AMBITIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE COUNTRY AS THE CHAMPION OF YOUNG AMERICA DOUGLAS HAD SO FAR AS POSSIBLE IN HIS CONGRESSIONAL CAREER MADE HIMSELF THE APOSTLE OF MODERN PROGRESS HE WAS A BELIEVER IN MANIFEST DESTINY AND A ZEALOUS ADVOCATE OF THE MONROE DOCTRINE
THE DECLARATION THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS OPPOSED THE WAR IS TRUE OR FALSE ACCORDINGLY AS ONE MAY UNDERSTAND THE TERM OPPOSING THE WAR IF TO SAY THE WAR WAS UNNECESSARILY AND UNCONSTITUTIONALLY COMMENCED BY THE PRESIDENT BE OPPOSING THE WAR THEN THE WHIGS HAVE VERY GENERALLY OPPOSED IT
LOG-CABINS WERE BUILT IN EVERY WESTERN COUNTY TUNS OF HARD CIDER WERE FILLED AND EMPTIED AT ALL THE WHIG MASS MEETINGS
LINCOLN CAPTAIN
THE COTTON-GIN WAS INVENTED IN 1793
FOREIGN CAPITAL WOULD BE INVESTED IN LAND AND COULD BE HEAVILY TAXED TO PAY BONDED INTEREST
DOMESTIC 121/2
ON THE 3D OF OCTOBER THEREFORE ELEVEN DAYS AFTER THE MEETING AS PUBLIC ATTENTION SEEMED TO BE FLAGGING WHITESIDES WROTE AN ACCOUNT OF IT TO THE SANGAMO JOURNAL FOR WHICH HE DID NOT FORGET TO SAY I HOLD MYSELF RESPONSIBLE OF COURSE HE SEIZED THE OCCASION TO PAINT A HEROIC PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF AND HIS PRINCIPAL
THAT SINGLE EFFORT MADE HIM THE LEADER ON THE NEW QUESTION IN HIS STATE
UNDER THE ORDINARY ROUTINE IT WAS REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON TERRITORIES AND ON THE 4TH DAY OF JANUARY DOUGLAS REPORTED BACK HIS SECOND NEBRASKA BILL STILL WITHOUT ANY REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE
LINCOLN CAPTAIN BLACK HAWK
STRINGFELLOW FOR SPEAKER
A DAY OR TWO AFTERWARDS DOUGLAS IN A CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION SHOWED MR HAMLIN THE DRAFT OF THE AMENDMENT IN MR PIERCE'S OWN HANDWRITING CHAPTER XX THE DRIFT OF POLITICS THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE MADE THE SLAVERY QUESTION PARAMOUNT IN EVERY STATE OF THE UNION

HE OFFERED YOUNG ABRAHAM A BOOK CONTAINING THE ELEMENTS OF THE ART AND TOLD HIM WHEN HE HAD MASTERED IT HE SHOULD HAVE EMPLOYMENT
THE LITTLE BOY THUS RELEASED RAN TO THE CABIN AND MORDECAI FROM THE LOFT RENEWED HIS FIRE UPON THE SAVAGES WHO BEGAN TO SHOW THEMSELVES FROM THE THICKET UNTIL JOSIAH RETURNED WITH ASSISTANCE FROM THE STOCKADE AND THE ASSAILANTS FLED
IF THIS IS THE UNDERSTANDING I WISH THAT MR LINCOLN WOULD STEP FORWARD AND LET US ARRANGE SOME PLAN UPON WHICH TO CARRY OUT THIS DISCUSSION MR LINCOLN WAS NOT THERE AT THE MOMENT AND THE ARRANGEMENT COULD NOT THEN BE MADE
HE CONCLUDED BY CHARGING WHITESIDES PLAINLY WITH INEFFICIENCY AND WANT OF KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE LAWS WHICH GOVERN GENTLEMEN IN MATTERS OF THIS KIND AND WITH TRYING TO WIPE OUT HIS FAULT BY DOING AN ACT OF INJUSTICE TO MR LINCOLN ILLUSTRATION
LINCOLN STARTED OFF AT A GAIT WHICH SHOWED HIS INTEREST IN THE MATTER IN HAND
KANSAS LAY DIRECTLY WEST OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI
AND A
THE BILLS WERE PASSED,--NOT WITHOUT OPPOSITION IT IS TRUE BUT BY SUFFICIENT MAJORITIES,--AND THE NEWS WAS RECEIVED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE WITH THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT DEMONSTRATIONS OF DELIGHT
IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF HIS LIFE TO ACCUMULATE A FORTUNE
THE FAIR CONTINUED NEARLY A WEEK
THESE ARE THE ESSENTIAL POINTS OF THE MEASURE AND THE SUCCESS OF MR LINCOLN IN GAINING THE ADHESION OF THE ABOLITIONISTS IN THE HOUSE IS MORE REMARKABLE THAN THAT HE SHOULD HAVE INDUCED THE WASHINGTON CONSERVATIVES TO APPROVE IT
THE NEBRASKA BILL DID NOT PASS TILL THE END OF MAY AND THE POLITICAL EXCITEMENT WAS AT ONCE TRANSFERRED FROM WASHINGTON TO EVERY DISTRICT OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY
BUT EVEN THIS WAS NOT ALL
THESE TACTICS WERE AGAIN REPEATED IN THE YEAR 1845 WHEN ON THE 3D OF MARCH IOWA A FREE STATE AND FLORIDA A SLAVE STATE WERE AUTHORIZED TO BE ADMITTED BY ONE ACT OF CONGRESS ITS APPROVAL BEING THE LAST OFFICIAL ACT OF PRESIDENT TYLER
THE TIME OF ENLISTMENT OF THE VOLUNTEERS HAD NOW COME TO AN END AND THE MEN SEEING NO PROSPECT OF GLORY OR PROFIT AND WEARY OF THE WORK AND THE HUNGER WHICH WERE THE ONLY CERTAIN INCIDENTS OF THE CAMPAIGN REFUSED IN GREAT PART TO CONTINUE IN SERVICE
UNTIL THEY FINISHED THEIR LAST DINNER AT THE PLANTER'S HOUSE IN ST LOUIS THE FLEDGELINGS OF CITIES THE LAWYERS DOCTORS MERCHANTS AND SPECULATORS WERE IN OR OF CIVILIZATION
AND AS IF THIS INDIGNITY WERE NOT ENOUGH HOLDING A JOINT SESSION FOR PUBLICLY SIGNING IT
INDEPENDENCE THE PLACE OF OUTFIT FOR THOSE DESTINED TO SANTA FE
THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS SO LUDICROUS THAT FRANCIS AND EVERYBODY ELSE DOUGLAS EXCEPTED HAVE BEEN LAUGHING ABOUT IT EVER SINCE DOUGLAS SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A GREAT PROPENSITY TO SUCH RENCONTRES OF WHICH THE ISSUE WAS ORDINARILY HIS COMPLETE DISCOMFITURE AS HE HAD THE UNTOWARD HABIT OF ATTACKING MUCH BIGGER AND STRONGER MEN THAN HIMSELF
YET IN THE FATE OF KANSAS AND IN THE ANNALS OF THE UNION AT LARGE IT WAS A VITAL AND PIVOTAL TRANSACTION WITHOUT WHICH THE GREAT CONFLICT BETWEEN FREEDOM AND SLAVERY THOUGH PERHAPS NEITHER AVOIDED NOR DELAYED MIGHT HAVE ASSUMED ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT
THE GENERAL PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE CONTROVERSY WAS SHOWN BY DISCUSSIONS CARRIED ON BY PRESS PULPIT AND IN THE DAILY CONVERSATION AND COMMENT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNION IN EVERY TOWN HAMLET AND NEIGHBORHOOD

HIS ARRIVAL EXCITED AN IMMEDIATE TUMULT IN THAT PLACE
BOTH WERE GOOD BOYS BUT I MUST SAY BOTH NOW BEING DEAD THAT ABE WAS THE BEST BOY I EVER SAW OR EXPECT TO SEE SUCH WERE THE BEGINNINGS OF THIS REMARKABLE CAREER SACRED AS WE SEE FROM CHILDHOOD TO DUTY AND TO HUMAN KINDLINESS
MANY A CHILD GREW UP WITHOUT EVER SEEING A PIECE OF MONEY
JANUARY 13 1848 IT WAS PROBABLY NOT SO MUCH THE FREE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY THAT THE SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR WAS DISTURBED ABOUT AS SOME OTHERS
HE WAS A FLUENT SELF-CONFIDENT SPEAKER WHO AFTER THE HABIT OF HIS TIME ADDRESSED HIS DISCOURSES MORE TO THE EMOTIONS THAN TO THE REASON OF HIS HEARERS
HOW INDEED IT WAS NOT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO GAINED THE PRIZE BUT THE PARAMOUNT DUTY WHICH CLAIMED THE MAN
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE 1 RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END BUT IT WAS EVEN THEN TOO LATE FOR ANY EXPEDIENTS TO SAVE THE MORIBUND PARTNERSHIP
HE USUALLY BEGAN AS THE PHRASE RAN BY GIVING AWAY HIS CASE
IN ONE OF THE LARGEST HOUSES LOOKING ON THE SQUARE AT THE NORTH-WEST CORNER THE COUNTY COURT HAD ITS OFFICES AND OTHER ROOMS IN THE BUILDING WERE LET TO LAWYERS
MR DAVIS'S COMPANY B FIRST UNITED STATES INFANTRY WAS STATIONED AT FORT CRAWFORD WISCONSIN DURING THE MONTHS OF JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 1832 AND HE IS BORNE ON THE ROLLS AS ABSENT ON DETACHED SERVICE AT THE DUBUQUE MINES BY ORDER OF COLONEL MORGAN FROM MARCH 26 TO AUGUST 18 1832 THE MUSTER-ROLLS OF HIS COMPANY REPORT HIM AS ABSENT ON FURLOUGH CHAPTER VI SURVEYOR AND REPRESENTATIVE SIDENOTE

LANE UNITED STATES SENATORS THE NEW CONSTITUTION WAS TRANSMITTED TO CONGRESS AND WAS FORMALLY PRESENTED AS A PETITION TO THE SENATE BY GENERAL CASS ON MARCH 24 1856 TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE
WE KNOW HE THOUGHT SERIOUSLY AT THIS TIME OF LEARNING THE TRADE OF A BLACKSMITH AND USING IN THAT HONEST WAY THE SINEW AND BRAWN WHICH NATURE HAD GIVEN HIM
IT WAS HARDLY MORE GRATEFUL THAN THE ROCKY HILL SLOPES OF NEW ENGLAND
THE PROFESSION OFFERED NO REWARDS SUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT MEN OF EDUCATION OR CAPACITY
WASHINGTON IS THE MIGHTIEST NAME OF EARTH--LONG SINCE MIGHTIEST IN THE CAUSE OF CIVIL LIBERTY
HE LEARNED HIS LETTERS THAT HE MIGHT READ BOOKS AND SEE HOW MEN IN THE GREAT WORLD OUTSIDE OF HIS WOODS HAD BORNE THEMSELVES IN THE FIGHT FOR WHICH HE LONGED
IT IS TO BE SURMISED THAT OFFUTT NEVER INSPIRED HIS NEIGHBORS AND CUSTOMERS WITH ANY DEEP REGARD FOR HIS SOLIDITY OF CHARACTER
THESE MOMENTOUS CONTINGENCIES COULD NOT HAVE SUGGESTED THEMSELVES TO HIM
KENTUCKY IN 1792 SLAVE
DURING THIS VISIT SPEED HIMSELF FELL IN LOVE AND BECAME ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED

THE BOLTING BARNBURNERS HAD GIVEN NEW YORK TO TAYLOR
THE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF DOUGLAS HASTENED TO EXPLAIN AND ASSERT HIS INNOCENCE OF ANY COMPLICITY WITH THIS POLITICAL RAID BUT THEY WERE NOT MORE THAN HALF BELIEVED
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE 2 RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END THIS WAS PUTTING THEIR FIDELITY TO A BITTER TRIAL
THE CONVENTION WAS DETERMINED THAT OLD ROUGH AND READY AS HE WAS NOW UNIVERSALLY NICKNAMED SHOULD RUN UPON HIS BATTLE-FLAGS AND HIS NAME OF WHIG--ALTHOUGH HE CAUTIOUSLY CALLED HIMSELF NOT AN ULTRA WHIG THE NOMINATION WAS RECEIVED WITH GREAT AND NOISY DEMONSTRATIONS OF ADHESION FROM EVERY QUARTER
10 P
10 P
HIS CAREER IN CONGRESS WAS SUFFICIENTLY CONSPICUOUS
THE ONSET OF THE SAVAGES ACTED LIKE AN ICY BATH ON THE RED-HOT VALOR OF THE VOLUNTEERS
IT IS BUT JUST TO HIS FAME HOWEVER TO SAY THAT HE COMPREHENDED EQUALLY WELL THE TRUE PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL NECESSITIES WHICH NOW DEMANDED THE OPENING OF KANSAS AND NEBRASKA AS A SECURE HIGHWAY AND PROTECTING BRIDGE TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND OUR NEW-FOUND EL DORADO NO LESS THAN AS A BOND OF UNION BETWEEN THE OLDER STATES AND THE IMPROVISED YOUNG AMERICA ON THE PACIFIC COAST

THE LOGANS AND CONKLINGS WERE GOOD LAWYERS BEFORE THEY ARRIVED
THAT HE WORE ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE TIME A DECENT SUIT OF BLUE JEANS
AND THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST UNPROMISING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EVER WITNESSED THE ADVENT OF A HERO INTO THIS WORLD ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS BORN ON THE 12TH DAY OF FEBRUARY 1809
A BIRD LIGHTING IN A WINDOW A DOG BAYING AT CERTAIN HOURS THE COUGH OF A HORSE IN THE DIRECTION OF A CHILD THE SIGHT OR WORSE STILL THE TOUCH OF A DEAD SNAKE HERALDED DOMESTIC WOE
THERE WAS NO TUMULT NO VIOLENCE BUT LITTLE PROTEST EVEN IN WORDS
THE PATRONAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS SCRAMBLED FOR AS A MATTER OF COURSE IN THE MIRE INTO WHICH JACKSON HAD FLUNG IT
SOME WEEKS LATER THE IMPOSSIBILITY REFERRED TO HAVING BECOME APPARENT MR LINCOLN APPLIED FOR THE PLACE
A MIDDAY DINNER
BUT AS THE SENATE HAD ALREADY REJECTED IT THE MOVEMENT REMAINED WITHOUT PRACTICAL RESULT
EATING SLEEPING STANDING GUARD TUGGING AT THE WHEEL OR DEFENDING LIFE AND PROPERTY THERE WAS NO RANK BETWEEN CAPTAIN AND COOK EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYED SAVANT AND IGNORAMUS BUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF DUTY AND THE ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY
SO I DETERMINED TO STRIKE AT ONCE
IF WE MAY TRUST THE WILLING TESTIMONY OF HIS OLD ASSOCIATES LINCOLN HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN HOLDING HIS OWN AGAINST HIS ADROIT ANTAGONIST AND IT WAS EVEN THOUGHT THAT THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS ILL SUCCESS IN THESE ENCOUNTERS WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS INFLUENCE IN INDUCING DOUGLAS AND HIS FOLLOWERS DEFEATED IN THE NATION THOUGH VICTORIOUS IN THE STATE TO WREAK THEIR VENGEANCE ON THE ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT
IN GIVING TO THE WIFE OF THE PIONEER LINCOLN THE NAME OF MARY SHIPLEY WE FOLLOW THE TRADITION IN HIS FAMILY
THE LOSS OF AT LEAST FOUR YEARS OF THE ACTIVE PURSUIT OF HIS PROFESSION WOULD HAVE BEEN IRREPARABLE LEAVING OUT OF VIEW THE STRONG PROBABILITY THAT THE SINGULAR CHARM OF WASHINGTON LIFE TO MEN WHO HAVE A PASSION FOR POLITICS MIGHT HAVE KEPT HIM THERE FOREVER
THE FACTION OF FIVE HAD BEEN STUBBORN TO DEFIANCE AND DISASTER

GIDDINGS WHOM HE REGARDED AS THE LEADING ABOLITIONIST IN CONGRESS A FACT WHICH SUFFICIENTLY PROVES THE PRACTICAL WISDOM WITH WHICH HE HAD RECONCILED THE DEMANDS OF RIGHT AND EXPEDIENCY
THERE WAS NO HINT OF FUTURE GLORY IN THE WEDDING OR THE BRINGING HOME OF NANCY LINCOLN
HE KNEW THIS HIMSELF AND AVOIDED SUCH CASES WHEN HE COULD CONSISTENTLY WITH THE RULES OF HIS PROFESSION
TO RESIST THE TENDENCY ALMOST UNIVERSAL AT THAT DAY TO SUPPLY WITH FLORID RHETORIC THE ATTORNEY'S DEFICIENCY IN LAW
AND STUART AT THAT TIME PROBABLY THE MOST PROMINENT YOUNG MAN IN THE DISTRICT AND THE ONE MARKED OUT BY THE PUBLIC VOICE FOR AN EARLY ELECTION TO CONGRESS 1164

NOVEMBER 29TH THE DAY OF ELECTION FOR DELEGATE FINALLY ARRIVED AND WITH IT A FORMIDABLE INVASION OF MISSOURI VOTERS AT MORE THAN HALF THE POLLING PLACES APPOINTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROCLAMATION
VOLUME II PP
THEY RODE MERRILY AWAY CAME TO OLD MAN'S CREEK THEREAFTER TO BE CALLED STILLMAN'S RUN AND ENCAMPED FOR THE NIGHT
WHEN THE FRIENDS OF WASHINGTON WERE FIRST PRESSING THE PRESIDENCY UPON HIM IN 1788 HE URGED HIS ADVANCED AGE AS AN IMPERATIVE REASON FOR DECLINING IT
HE DIRECTED HIS MILITIA GENERALS TO REPRESS DISORDER AND CHECK ANY ATTACK ON THE TOWN
BUT WE SHOULD GREATLY ERR IF WE ATTRIBUTED THE NEW EVENTS IN LINCOLN'S CAREER TO THE CAPRICE OF FORTUNE
WHEN LINCOLN RAN FOR THE LEGISLATURE ON HIS RETURN FROM THE
HE REPRESENTS HIMSELF WITH THE USUAL INVERTED PRIDE OF A CLASS-LEADER AS HAVING BEEN A WILD VICIOUS YOUTH
THE CANVASS WAS AN ENERGETIC ONE THROUGHOUT AND EXCITED MORE INTEREST IN THE DISTRICT THAN EVEN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHICH OCCURRED SOME MONTHS LATER
FOR LOG-ROLLINGS WHERE TONS OF EXCELLENT TIMBER WERE PILED TOGETHER AND WASTEFULLY BURNED
THEY WERE BUSY AT EVERY HORSE-RACE ARRANGING THEIR PLANS AND EXTENDING THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
IT WAS PLAINLY MARKED WITH HARNESS AND WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE LOST SOME OF HIS SHOES
SWETT THE MAN IS GUILTY
COMING BY WAY OF THE MISSOURI RIVER TOWNS HE FELL FIRST AMONG BORDER-RUFFIAN COMPANIONSHIP AND INFLUENCES
FOUR YEARS LATER THOMAS LINCOLN PURCHASED A FINE FARM OF 238 ACRES ON KNOB CREEK NEAR WHERE IT FLOWS INTO THE ROLLING FORK AND SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A PORTION OF IT INTO CULTIVATION
SOMETIMES HE EXCITED THE AUDIENCE BY THAT FLORID AND EXUBERANT RHETORIC WHICH HE KNEW WELL ENOUGH HOW AND WHEN TO INDULGE IN
HE WAS A VERY TALL GAWKY AND ROUGH-LOOKING FELLOW THEN
THE WEAPONS CHOSEN WERE CAVALRY BROADSWORDS OF THE LARGEST SIZE
THEY WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO RISE ONCE IN THEIR MIGHT AND SAY THEY WOULD NOT HAVE SLAVERY AMONG THEM
BUT NEITHER HE NOR TAYLOR WAS A FAVORITE OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THEIR BRILLIANT SUCCESS BROUGHT NO GAIN OF POPULARITY TO MR POLK AND HIS CABINET
OF COURSE I CANNOT DEMONSTRATE WHAT I SAY
BUT THE BUSTAMENTE ADMINISTRATION LOST NO TIME IN REPUDIATING THIS TREATY AND AT ONCE RENEWED THE WAR WHICH HAD BEEN CARRIED ON IN A FITFUL WAY EVER SINCE
I REGRET MY DEFEAT MODERATELY BUT AM NOT NERVOUS ABOUT IT."--LINCOLN TO WASHBURNE FEBRUARY 9 1855
RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED TO INFORM THIS HOUSE
HIS AMBITION AS A LAWYER INCREASED
HE WAS HIMSELF PROPHET AS WELL AS WARRIOR AND HAD DOUBTLESS HIS SHARE OF MANIA WHICH IS THE STRENGTH OF PROPHETS
HIS SPEECH WAS NOT PARTICULARLY WELL RECEIVED IN ILLINOIS
THE HARRISON CAMPAIGN
INDEED THE BORDER RUFFIAN HABIT OF VOTING IN KANSAS HAD BECOME CHRONIC AND DID NOT CEASE FOR SOME YEARS AND SOMETIMES DEVELOPED THE GRIMMEST HUMORS
ON THE MORNING OF ELECTION THE WORKING DEMOCRATS APPEARED AT EVERY POLL DISTRIBUTING TICKETS BEARING THE NAME OF A SINGLE CANDIDATE NOT BEFORE MENTIONED BY ANY ONE
I WAS CIRCUIT PROSECUTING ATTORNEY AT THE TIME OF THE TRIALS AT THE FALLS OF FALL CREEK WHERE PENDLETON NOW STANDS
SHELBYVILLE NOV
MY CASE IS THROWN EXCLUSIVELY UPON THE INDEPENDENT VOTERS OF THE COUNTY
SO THAT THIS CLAUSE IF IT HAD ANY FORCE WHATEVER WOULD HAVE AUTHORIZED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SLAVERY IN A PORTION OF NEW MEXICO WHERE IT DID NOT EXIST AND WHERE IT HAD BEEN EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED BY THE MEXICAN LAW
IT WAS INDUSTRIOUSLY REPORTED THAT THEY WERE COMING TWENTY THOUSAND STRONG TO CONTROL THE ELECTION
TO RETRIEVE SOMEWHAT THE PRECIPITANCY OF HIS MILITIA ORDERS AND PROCLAMATIONS HE WROTE TO SHERIFF JONES DECEMBER 2 TO MAKE NO ARRESTS OR MOVEMENTS UNLESS BY HIS DIRECTION
NO MAN AND NO PARTY COULD OPPOSE IT EXCEPT AT SERIOUS COST
BOTH THE NATIONAL CONVENTIONS OF 1852 SOLEMNLY RESOLVED THAT THEY WOULD DISCOUNTENANCE AND RESIST IN CONGRESS OR OUT OF IT WHENEVER WHEREVER OR HOWEVER OR UNDER WHATEVER COLOR OR SHAPE ANY FURTHER RENEWAL OF THE SLAVERY AGITATION
THEY BECAME FAMOUS IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE PARTLY FOR THEIR STATURE AND PARTLY FOR THEIR INFLUENCE IN LEGISLATION
THE GOOD-WILL OF THE ADMINISTRATION WAS MANIFESTED BY MAKING ONE OF THE EDITORS POSTMASTER AT THE NEW TOWN
JOHN CALHOUN THE SURVEYOR-GENERAL MADE THE PRINCIPAL SPEECH A DENUNCIATION OF THE ABOLITIONISTS SUPPORTING THE TOPEKA MOVEMENT
HE BEGAN HIS SPEECH DEFENDING HIS COURSE AS WELL AS HE COULD
IT WAS OFTEN VERY EFFECTIVE PRODUCING SHOUTS AND GROANS AND GENUFLECTIONS AMONG THE AUDIENCE AT LARGE AND TERRIBLE CONVULSIONS AMONG THE MORE NERVOUS AND EXCITABLE
IN TAKING LEAVE OF THIS SUBJECT I WISH TO STATE THAT I HAVE DETERMINED NEVER TO MAKE ANOTHER SPEECH UPON THE SLAVERY QUESTION
THE UNITED STATES ARSENAL AT LIBERTY MISSOURI WAS BROKEN INTO AND STRIPPED OF ITS CONTENTS TO SUPPLY CANNON SMALL ARMS AND AMMUNITION
THE STATE THEN CONTAINED NEARLY 250,000 INHABITANTS AND THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ELECTED PURELY ON PERSONAL GROUNDS NOMINATED BY THEMSELVES OR THEIR NEIGHBORS WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF PARTY MACHINERY WERE NECESSARILY THE LEADING MEN IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IN THEIR SEVERAL DISTRICTS
RICHARDSON TO SHANNON DECEMBER 3 1855
JOHN JOHNSTON WAS AFTERWARDS ADDED TO THE PARTY PROBABLY AT THE REQUEST OF HIS FOSTER-BROTHER TO SHARE IN THE GOLDEN PROFITS OF THE ENTERPRISE
THE ACQUAINTANCES HE MADE IN HIS CANVASS THE PRACTICE HE GAINED IN SPEAKING AND THE ADDED CONFIDENCE WHICH THIS EXPERIENCE OF MEASURING HIS ABILITIES WITH THOSE OF OTHERS GAVE WERE ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH LINCOLN DERIVED FROM THIS ATTEMPT
WE MUST SUBMIT TO THEM
THE LIFE WAS NEITHER ENJOYABLE NOR WHOLESOME
LINCOLN 45
GLOBE FEB
GLOBE FEB
GLOBE FEB
AND THE APPORTIONMENT OF REPRESENTATIVES GAVE TO THE NORTH THIRTY-FIVE MEMBERS AND FOURTEEN SENATORS TO THE SOUTH THIRTY MEMBERS AND TWELVE SENATORS
SOMETIMES WENT INTO THE FIELD AND RENEWED HIS EXPLOITS AS A FARM-HAND WHICH HAD GAINED HIM A TRADITIONAL FAME IN INDIANA
IT ALSO SENT MACHINERY FOR A FEW SAW-MILLS THE TYPES AND PRESSES FOR TWO OR THREE NEWSPAPERS AND ERECTED A HOTEL OR BOARDING-HOUSE TO ACCOMMODATE NEWCOMERS
FROM THE TIME THE UNLOOKED-FOR COURSE OF SENATOR DOUGLAS MADE IT A PRACTICAL POSSIBILITY ATCHISON WAS ALL ZEAL AND DEVOTION TO THIS OBJECT WHICH HE DECLARED WAS ALMOST AS DEAR TO HIM AS HIS HOPE OF HEAVEN
A POT KETTLE AND SKILLET AND A FEW TIN AND PEWTER DISHES WERE ALL THE FURNITURE
THE STUDENT OF MILITARY HISTORY WILL RARELY MEET WITH NARRATIVES OF BATTLES IN ANY AGE WHERE THE ACTUAL OPERATIONS COINCIDE SO EXACTLY WITH THE ORDERS ISSUED UPON THE EVE OF CONFLICT AS IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS OF THE WONDERFULLY ENERGETIC AND SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN IN WHICH GENERAL SCOTT WITH A HANDFUL OF MEN RENEWED THE MEMORY OF THE CONQUEST OF CORTES IN HIS TRIUMPHANT MARCH FROM VERA CRUZ TO THE CAPITAL
SUCH A THING IF WE MISTAKE NOT WAS NEVER KNOWN AGAIN IN ILLINOIS
13 1843 AND WAS PRINTED A YEAR LATER IN THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCER WITH THE DATE ALTERED TO 1844
HIS OWN DEEPER NATURE HAD SUFFERED FROM THESE SAME FANTASTIC SORROWS AND TERRORS
IT IS RELATED THAT ONCE WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING HE SAW A RUFFIAN ATTACK A FRIEND OF HIS IN THE CROWD AND THE RENCONTRE NOT RESULTING ACCORDING TO THE ORATOR'S SYMPATHIES HE DESCENDED FROM THE STAND SEIZED THE OBJECTIONABLE FIGHTING MAN BY THE NECK THREW HIM SOME TEN FEET THEN CALMLY MOUNTED TO HIS PLACE AND FINISHED HIS SPEECH THE COURSE OF HIS LOGIC UNDISTURBED BY THIS ATHLETIC PARENTHESIS
NEVERTHELESS IT TURNED OUT THAT EVEN AFTER THIS LOSS THE OPPOSITION TO DOUGLAS WOULD HAVE A MAJORITY ON JOINT BALLOT
AND WITH ALL THE LIGHTS YOU THEN HAD THE VIEWS YOU TOOK APPEAR TO ME AS VERY REASONABLE

LINCOLN TO CODDING NOV
THEY DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT SUCH DENUNCIATION IS DIRECTED BY UNDYING HATRED TO THEM AS THE REGISTER WOULD HAVE IT BELIEVED THERE ARE TWO SUCH WHIGS ON THIS FLOOR COLONEL HASKELL AND MAJOR JAMES THE FORMER FOUGHT AS A COLONEL BY THE SIDE OF COLONEL BAKER AT CERRO GORDO AND STANDS SIDE BY SIDE WITH ME IN THE VOTE THAT YOU SEEM DISSATISFIED WITH
OR PERHAPS I SHOULD RATHER SAY THAT WHETHER IT HAS SUCH JUST APPLICATION DEPENDS UPON WHETHER A NEGRO IS NOT OR IS A MAN
LENGTHY FOOTNOTE 1 RELOCATED TO CHAPTER END WHEN WE NUMBER THE NAMES WHICH LEAPED INTO SUDDEN FAME IN THAT SHORT BUT SANGUINARY WAR IT IS SURPRISING TO FIND HOW FEW OF THEM SYMPATHIZED WITH THE PARTY WHO BROUGHT IT ON OR WITH THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS WAGED
CONSEQUENTLY I GO FOR ADMITTING ALL WHITES TO THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE WHO PAY TAXES OR BEAR ARMS BY NO MEANS EXCLUDING FEMALES IF ELECTED I SHALL CONSIDER THE WHOLE PEOPLE OF SANGAMON MY CONSTITUENTS AS WELL THOSE THAT OPPOSE AS THOSE THAT SUPPORT ME
ON REFLECTION HOWEVER THIS WAS DISCOVERED TO BE BUT ANOTHER CASE OF SATAN REBUKING SIN
SHE HAD IT IS SAID REJECTED HIM TO MARRY ONE JOHNSTON THE JAILER AT ELIZABETHTOWN WHO HAD DIED LEAVING HER WITH THREE CHILDREN A BOY AND TWO GIRLS
ONE OF HIS COLLEAGUES TELLS US HE WAS NOT DISTINGUISHED BY ANY EXTERNAL ECCENTRICITY
GOVERNOR FORD IN HIS ADMIRABLE SKETCH OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE STATE MENTIONS TWO ACTS OF THE LEGISLATURE BOTH OF THEM PROPER AND BENEFICIAL AS UNEQUALED IN THEIR DESTRUCTIVE INFLUENCE UPON THE GREAT FOLKS OF THE STATE
VAN BUREN WAS NOT IN PRINCIPLE OPPOSED TO THE ADMISSION OF TEXAS INTO THE UNION AT THE PROPER TIME AND WITH THE PROPER CONDITIONS BUT THE MORE ARDENT DEMOCRATS OF THE SOUTH WERE UNWILLING TO LISTEN TO ANY CONDITIONS OR ANY SUGGESTION OF DELAY
ABOUT A YEAR LATER THE PROVISIONAL LEGISLATURE AGAIN WENT THROUGH THE FORMS OF ASSEMBLING AND ALTHOUGH GOVERNOR WALKER WAS PRESENT IN TOPEKA THERE WERE NO PROCLAMATIONS NO DRAGOONS NO CANNON BECAUSE THE CABAL WAS FOR THE MOMENT DEFEATED AND DISCONCERTED AND BENT UPON OTHER AND STILL MORE DESPERATE SCHEMES
GOVERNOR REEDER'S VETOES
HARRISON UNDER THE CONTROL OF ANY REGIMENT OR BRIGADE BUT RECEIVED ORDERS DIRECTLY FROM THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND ALWAYS WHEN WITH THE ARMY CAMPED WITHIN THE LINES AND HAD MANY OTHER PRIVILEGES SUCH AS HAVING NO CAMP DUTIES TO PERFORM AND DRAWING RATIONS AS MUCH AND AS OFTEN AS WE PLEASED WHICH WOULD SEEM TO LIKEN THIS BATTALION AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE FABLED REGIMENT OF BRIGADIERS WITH THIS ELITE CORPS LINCOLN SERVED THROUGH HIS SECOND ENLISTMENT THOUGH IT WAS NOT HIS FORTUNE TO TAKE PART IN EITHER OF THE TWO ENGAGEMENTS IN WHICH GENERAL JAMES D

HE HAD PLEDGED HIMSELF IN HIS PUBLIC ADDRESSES TO VOTE FOR NO TERRITORIAL ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD NOT VIRTUALLY ANNUL IT
THE FREE STATE OF IOWA LAY A HUNDRED MILES TO THE NORTH AND THE FREE STATE OF ILLINOIS TWO HUNDRED TO THE EAST
421 SUCH IS THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL RECORD OF THIS REMARKABLE POLITICAL TRANSACTION LEFT BY TWO PROMINENT AND PRINCIPAL INSTIGATORS AND NEVER DENIED NOR REPUDIATED BY THE THIRD
IN FACT THERE ARE FEW MEN WHO HAVE EVER LIVED IN THIS COUNTRY WITH MORE OF THE PECULIAR TEMPERAMENT OF THE ORATOR THAN EDWARD DICKINSON BAKER IT IS RELATED OF HIM THAT ON ONE OCCASION WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES CALLED FOR A POLICY OF RESERVE HE WAS URGED BY HIS FRIENDS TO GO OUT UPON A BALCONY AND ADDRESS AN IMPROMPTU AUDIENCE WHICH WAS CALLING FOR HIM
LINCOLN'S SECOND TRIP TO NEW ORLEANS
T'OTHER SIDE SANGAMON HE THREW A HANDFUL OF DRIED LEAVES IN THE AIR TO SHOW HOW HE WOULD SCATTER THE PALE FACES BUT HE NEVER FULFILLED HIS THREATS FURTHER THAN TO COME IN OCCASIONALLY AND ASK FOR A DRINK OF WHISKY
AN INNATE LOVE OF COMBAT WAS IN HIS HEART
HE DIED JANUARY 25 1825
WHEN SO CONVINCED WHETHER THE CAUSE WAS GREAT OR SMALL HE WAS USUALLY SUCCESSFUL
ANY VARIATION IN THE DREARY COURSE OF EVENTS WAS WELCOME
I THINK SAYS MR BROWNING IT WAS ONLY AN INTENSIFICATION OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL MELANCHOLY
FRENCH BRANDY PER PINT 25
UNDER DATE OF NOVEMBER 14 1839 HE WROTE
TOIL AND EXPOSURE HUNGER AND THIRST WIND AND STORM DANGER IN CAMP QUARREL OR INDIAN AMBUSH WERE THE FAMILIAR AND ORDINARY VICISSITUDES OF A THREE MONTHS JOURNEY IN A CARAVAN OF THE PLAINS
AS A SPECIMEN OF THESE STORIES WE GIVE THE FOLLOWING WELL VOUCHED FOR AS APOCRYPHA GENERALLY ARE
TWO OR MORE OF THEM WERE CANDIDATES FOR THE NOMINATION AT EVERY ELECTION FROM THE TIME WHEN STUART RETIRED UNTIL THE WHIGS LOST THE DISTRICT
IT IS AN ERROR TO SUPPOSE THAT ALL THIS COULD BE UNDERGONE WITH IMPUNITY
IN THE NEW CONGRESS THERE WERE IN THE HOUSE AS NEARLY AS THE CLASSIFICATION COULD BE MADE ABOUT 108 ANTI-NEBRASKA MEMBERS NEARLY 40 KNOW-NOTHINGS AND ABOUT 75 DEMOCRATS
DO I MISUNDERSTAND THEM WHETHER THIS LETTER WAS EVER REPLIED TO IS UNCERTAIN THOUGH IMPROBABLE
SUCH ACHIEVEMENT AND SUCH DISTINCTION HOWEVER WERE NOT SO UNCOMMON AS TO APPEAR PHENOMENAL
IN THE TERRITORY OF KENTUCKY AND AFTERWARDS IN THAT OF ILLINOIS IT OCCURRED AT SEVERAL PERIODS IN THE TRANSITION FROM COUNTIES TO TERRITORIES AND STATES THAT THE COUNTRY WAS WITHOUT ANY ORGANIZED AUTHORITY
UPON A CAREFUL COLLATION OF EVIDENCE THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS WAS OF THE OPINION THAT THE VOTE WOULD HAVE RETURNED A FREE-STATE LEGISLATURE IF THE ELECTION HAD BEEN CONFINED TO THE ACTUAL SETTLERS
BUT ON ONE OCCASION BEING IN THE MINORITY AND HAVING EXHAUSTED EVERY OTHER PARLIAMENTARY MEANS OF OPPOSITION AND DELAY AND SEEING THE VOTE THEY DREADED IMMINENT THEY TRIED TO DEFEAT IT BY LEAVING THE HOUSE IN A BODY AND THE DOORS BEING LOCKED A NUMBER OF THEM AMONG WHOM MR LINCOLN'S TALL FIGURE WAS PROMINENT JUMPED FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE CHURCH WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WAS THEN HOLDING ITS SESSIONS
HIS BEARING AND GESTICULATION HAD NO AWKWARDNESS ABOUT THEM
REEDER SIDENOTE
THERE WAS NO TIME FOR THE GRADUAL APPROACHES OF AN IDLER AND MORE CONVENTIONAL AGE
IT WAS DURING THESE YEARS OF THE WAR THAT WE FORMED THE DESIGN OF WRITING THIS HISTORY AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR IT
IN THE NEXT HE WAS EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL BUT BARELY ESCAPED DROWNING IN SPOON RIVER
FORT LEAVENWORTH WAS THE POINT OF RENDEZVOUS FOR THOSE GOING TO CALIFORNIA AND OREGON
STURTEVANT ADDRESS TO OLD SETTLERS OF MORGAN COUNTY SIDENOTE
THEY ADDRESSED THEMSELVES AT ONCE TO THE WORK REQUIRED OF THEM AND SOON DEVISED WITH RECKLESS AND UNREASONING HASTE A SCHEME OF RAILROADS COVERING THE VAST UNINHABITED PRAIRIES AS WITH A GRIDIRON
ALLOW ALL THE GOVERNED AN EQUAL VOICE IN THE GOVERNMENT
THE OLD BARBAROUS EQUALITY OF THE EARLIER TIME WAS GONE
