THE PRINCE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF FOURTEEN AND HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH PIETY AND PRAYERS LOVING THE POOR THE OLEMA AND THE KORAN STUDENTS SO THAT ALL THE PEOPLE OF BAGHDAD LOVED HIM MEN AND WOMEN
A POPULAR SAYING OF MOHAMMED'S IS ALL VERY LONG MEN ARE FOOLS SAVE OMAR AND ALL VERY SHORT MEN ARE KNAVES SAVE ALI THE PERSIANS WHO ABHOR OMAR COMPARE EVERY LENGTHY UNGAINLY LONGSOME THING WITH HIM
BUT AS REGARDS ABRIZAH SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SON LIKE THE MOON AND MARJANAH TOOK THE BABE AND DID HIM THE NECESSARY OFFICES AND LAID HIM BY HIS MOTHER'S SIDE
MEANWHILE THE MOSLEMS ALIGNED THEIR FORCES AND THEREUPON SHARRKAN CAME TO HIS BROTHER ZAU AL-MAKAN AND SAID O KING OF THE AGE DOUBTLESS THEY MEAN TO CHAMPION IT AND THAT IS ALSO THE OBJECT OF OUR DESIRE
I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF IT IN THESE DAYS
SO IF HE HAVE COMMERCE WITH HER HAPLY SHE WILL CONCEIVE BY HIM AND HER SON BE A HYPOCRITE A MAN OF WRATH AND A SHEDDER OF BLOOD

THERE IS NAUGHT IN THEE TO SATISFY THE THIRSTY NOR AUGHT TO GRATIFY ONE WHOSE THIRST IS SATISFIED

THEN HE STEPPED UP TO THE TWO LITTLE SLAVE-GIRLS AND CRIED ALOUD AT THEM
THIS IS THE MOST PERILOUS THING I EVER DID
SO WHEN HE WAS GONE SHE SAID TO THE CALIPH O PRINCE OF THE FAITHFUL I WOULD THOU LET SOME OF THE PEOPLE OF IRAK COME IN AND TALK TO THEE THAT I MAY HEAR THEIR DISCOURSE THEREWITH MU'AWIYAH SAID TO HIS ATTENDANTS SEE WHO IS AT THE DOOR AND THEY ANSWERED THE BANU TAMIM LET THEM COME IN SAID HE

AND DROPPED THE DRUG INTO HER CUP SHE KNOWING NAUGHT OF IT
COME LET US JOIN THEM SO WE WALKED ON TILL WE CAME TO THEM AND BEHOLD
THEREUPON QUOTH MU'AYKIB I RETURNED TO MY OWN HOUSE AND WHILE I WAS SITTING THERE BEHOLD A MESSENGER CAME TO ME FROM OMAR AND I WAS AFRAID AND WENT TO HIM AND WHEN I CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN HIS HAND WAS THE DIRHAM I HAD GIVEN HIS SON
BITRIK)=PATRICIUS A TITLE GIVEN TO CHRISTIAN KNIGHTS WHO COMMANDED TEN THOUSAND MEN
SO THEY BROUGHT HIM SOME MONEY FROM CERTAIN OF THE MERCHANTS WHO WERE IN THE BAZAR AND BOUGHT FOOD AND FED HIM THEREWITH
SHARRKAN TOOK IT AND READ AS FOLLOWS AFTER THE USUAL BISMILLAH THIS IS FROM THE AFFLICTED DISTRACTED MAN FROM HIM WHO HATH LOST HIS CHILDREN AND HOME BY BANE AND BAN KING OMAR BIN AL NU'UMAN TO HIS SON SHARRKAN
QUOTH THE SHAYKH AND INDEED INTOXICATION HAD OVERCOME HIM YE TWO ARE BOLDER THAN I AM THEN HE ROSE TO HIS FEET AND OPENED ALL THE LATTICES AND SAT DOWN AGAIN
27
THEN SHE SMILED IN MY FACE AND SAID O MY COUSIN ALLAH GRANT THEE ENJOYMENT OF THAT WHICH HE HATH GIVEN THEE
THEN SHE AROSE AND KILLED ANOTHER FOWL AND BOILED IT
THE ORANGE WITH BUDS LIKE PINK CORAL AND MARGUERITE
AND PRESENTLY ONE OF THEM SAID O MY BRETHREN WE ARE WEARIED WITH WALKING AND WITH LIFTING UP AND SETTING DOWN THE CHEST AND WITH UNLOCKING AND LOCKING THE GATE
AND THE SLAVE CEASED NOT TRAVELLING WITH THEM NIGHT AND DAY THROUGH THE PASSES OF THE MOUNTAINS TILL THERE REMAINED BUT MUSINGLY MARCH BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR OWN COUNTRY
NOW WHEN IT WAS NEAR DAWN THEY DISMOUNTED FROM THEIR DROMEDARIES AND THE BADAWI CAME UP TO NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN AND SAID TO HER O CITY STRUMPET WHAT IS THIS WEEPING
I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN MY BUSINESS
AND BUT FOR HER I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN UNITED TO THEE SHE THEN ASKED ME DID THY COUSIN THEN KNOW OF US

AS SOON AS HE AWOKE THE HAND MAIDS CAME TO HIM WITH TABRETS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS OF MIRTH AND MERRIMENT AS WONT
SO I TOOK OUT ONE AND THREW IT BACK INTO THE NEST
AND THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM GATHERED ROUND HIM AND WERE MOVED TO TEARS SEEING HIS CONDITION
SHE TOSSETH ON THE COUCH OF SEPARATION AND HER EYES ARE BLACKENED WITH THE PENCILS OF SLEEPLESSNESS
WHILST THE FRANKS GATHERED ROUND THEIR CAPTAIN AND SAID VERILY THIS DAY WE DID NOT WIN OUR WILL OF THESE AND HE REPLIED AT EARLY DAWN WHEN THE MORROW SHALL MORN WE WILL DRAW OUT AND CHALLENGE THEM ONE AFTER ONE THEY ALSO RESTED IN THAT MIND AND BOTH CAMPS KEPT GUARD UNTIL ALMIGHTY ALLAH SENT THE LIGHT OF DAY DAWN

FN#496 THE MEN WHO CRY TO PRAYER
THEN HE TURNED TO THE MERCHANT AND SAID TO HIM THERE SHE SITTETH
I MEAN TO GIVE ONE TO THY BROTHER ZAU AL-MAKAN AND THE OTHER TO THY SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN BUT WHEN SHARRKAN HEARD THAT HE HAD A BROTHER FOR TO THAT TIME HE KNEW ONLY OF HIS SISTER HE TURNED TO HIS SIRE AND SAID TO HIM O KING HAST THOU A SON OTHER THAN MYSELF HE ANSWERED YES AND HE IS NOW SIX YEARS OLD ADDING THAT HIS NAME WAS ZAU AL MAKAN AND THAT HE AND NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN WERE TWINS BORN AT A BIRTH
ALLAH REQUITE HIM QUOTH THE EUNUCH IF THOU HAPPEN UPON HIM POINT HIM OUT TO ME AND I WILL LAY HANDS ON HIM AND BRING HIM TO THE DOOR OF OUR LADY'S LITTER[FN#309 OR DO THOU TAKE HIM WITH THINE OWN HAND SAID THE FIREMAN GO THOU BACK AND I WILL BRING HIM TO THEE SO THE EUNUCH LEFT HIM AND WENT HIS WAYS
SO THEY HAVE NEED OF THE SULTAN THAT HE DO JUSTICE BETWEEN THEM AND ORDER THEIR AFFAIRS
ONE DAY THERE CAME TO KING SHARRKAN A COURIER FROM HIS FATHER WITH A LETTER WHICH HE TOOK AND READ AND FOUND THEREIN AFTER THE BISMILLAH KNOW O BELOVED KING THAT I AM AFFLICTED WITH SORE AFFLICTION FOR THE LOSS OF MY CHILDREN
I USED WHEN I MOUNTED MY STEED TO HAVE THE MASTERY OF HIM BUT NOW I AM UNABLE TO RIDE
THEREAT THE HORRORS OF DOOMDAY ROSE UPON KING AFRIDUN,[FN#405 AND HE KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO MAKING STRAIGHT THEIR CROOK
AND FOLLOWED HIM ZAU AL-MAKAN AND THE WAZIR DANDAN AND THE EMIRS BAHRAM AND RUSTAM WITH HIS BROTHER TARKASH
THEY DRANK AND EACH PLAYED WITH EACH TILL THEIR CHEEKS FLUSHED RED AND THEIR EYES TOOK A DARKER HUE AND GHANIM'S SOUL LONGED TO KISS THE GIRL AND TO LIE WITH HER AND HE SAID O MY LADY GRANT ME ONE KISS OF THAT DEAR MOUTH
SO JONATHAN HAD A YOUNG MAN BRAVE WHO BARE HIS ARMOUR I SAM
WHEN SHARRKAN SAID TO ZAU AL-MAKAN VERILY THIS MAN CARRIETH RENUNCIATION OF THE WORLD TO THE EXTREME OF RENOUNCING AND WERE IT NOT FOR THIS HOLY WAR I WOULD JOIN MYSELF TO HIM AND WORSHIP ALLAH IN HIS SERVICE TILL I CAME BEFORE HIS PRESENCE
COUNSEL EVERY TRUE BELIEVER WHEN HE ASKETH THEE CONCERNING THE THINGS OF HIS FAITH
FOR THIRTEEN YEARS I HAVE NOT DONE A THING OF THE KIND NUR AL-DIN FEIGNED TO FORGET HE WAS THERE AND DRINKING OFF THE CUP THREW HIMSELF ON THE GROUND AS IF THE DRINK HAD OVERCOME HIM
AND THE HOST OF AL-ISLAM PRESSED THEM IN FRONT AND ON FLANK AND WROUGHT THEM GRIEVOUS HARM
IT IS THOU HAST CAUSED THIS GREAT DISTRESS TO US AND SHE HAD ANSWERED O GREAT KING AND MIGHTY COHEN I WILL TEACH THEE A TRICK WOULD BAFFLE THE DEVIL HIMSELF THOUGH HE SUMMON TO HIS ASSISTANCE ALL HIS GRISLY HOSTS
KAYLULAH WITH THE GUTTURAL KAF IS SLEEPING BEFORE EVENING PRAYERS AND FAYLULAH IS SLUMBERING AFTER SUNSET--BOTH HELD TO BE HIGHLY DETRIMENTAL
AND AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY THEY MOUNTED AND EACH BORE DOWN ON OTHER AND CEASED NOT TO FIGHT TILL HALF THE DAY WAS DONE
AND THIS INDEED WERE BETTER THAN LEAVING THE GOOD WORK TO HIM WHO SHALL RULE AFTER THEE OMAR LOOKED AT HIM WITH A LOOK OF WRATH AND WONDER AND PRESENTLY REPLIED O MASLAMAH I HAVE DEFENDED THEM FROM THIS SIN ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE AND SHALL I MAKE THEM MISERABLE AFTER MY DEATH
NAY THE INFIDELS TORTURED HIM NIGHT AND DAY
AND THIS IS THE REASON OF MY WEAKNESS OF BODY AND CHANGE OF COMPLEXION
SO I ASKED WHAT DOST THOU WITH THESE DOGS THEY ARE NOT DOGS BUT WOLVES ANSWERED THE SHEPHERD
ILIAD XXXII 700 ETC FN#175 SO BITING WAS ALLOWED AMONGST THE GREEKS IN THE GREEK LETTERS HE FINAL STRUGGLE ON THE GROUND
AS FOR THE PLACING HER TWO FINGERS ON HER BOSOM BETWEEN HER BREASTS ITS EXPLANATION IS THAT SHE SAITH
AS WHEN A BIRD WITH WIDELY-SPREADING WINGS LEAVETH THE SKY TO SETTLE ON THE SEA SO THE VESSEL SAILED ON HER FASTEST AND THE WIND TO HER WAS FAIREST
FOR IN GOOD SOOTH SHE HATH NOT HER EQUAL IN THE FAR PARTS OF THE WORLD NOR IN THE NEAR
285
OR IF ANOTHER SAID O MY LORD SUCH A HOUSE IS HANDSOME HE WOULD ANSWER TAKE IT
THEN AROSE OMAR AND WORKED A WORK AND STROVE IN HOLY WAR AND STRIFE WHERE OF NONE MIGHT DO THE LIKE
WHEN ZAU AL-MAKAN SAW HIM HE ROSE IN HONOUR
AND THEY SHALL BECOME THINE AND BE AT THY DISPOSAL
FN#355 A LEARNED MAN OF THE EIGHTH CENTURY AT BASSORAH A.D FN#356 A TRADITIONIST OF KHORASAN IN THE NINTH CENTURY A.D FN#357 AZAL OPP
THEN THEY LOOSED ON TO THEM THE HOUNDS AND LYNXES[FN#472 AND HAWKS;[FN#473 AND THEY SHOT THE QUARRY DOWN WITH SHAFTS WHICH PIERCED THEIR VITALS
SO LET US HEAR SOMETHING OF ALL THIS HE HATH MENTIONED AND FAVOUR US WITH A SHORT DISCOURSE ON SUCH SUBJECTS SHE REPLIED SAYING
BUT THE STORY TELLER HAS NOT QUITE MADE UP HIS MIND ABOUT WHICH CAESAREA HE IS TALKING AND M
AND BRANDISHING THEIR SCYMITARS AND LANCES RUSHED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK
BUT TAKE THOU THIS AS THE BEST I CAN DO FOR THEE THEN HE THREW THE GOLD PIECES TO THE CALIPH WHO TOOK THEM AND KISSED THEM AND PUT THEM IN POUCH
AND IT FITTETH HIM TO UNITE PEN AND SWORD
THIS IS HOW IT FARED WITH HIM
AND AS SOON AS HE REVIVED FEAR FLUTTERED THE SCROTUM[FN#408 BELOW HIS BELLY AND HE COMPLAINED TO THE ANCIENT DAME ZAT AL-DAWAHI
AND THE DAME SAID TO HER NAIMAN
SO HE TOLD HIM ALL THAT ABRIZAH HAD TOLD HIM AND WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM AND SAID SHE HATH PARTED FROM HER SIRE AND DEPARTED FROM HER REIGN AND HATH CHOSEN TO TAKE PART WITH US AND MAKE HER ABODE WITH US
FN#430 CARRIER-PIGEONS WERE EXTENSIVELY USED AT THIS TIME
223 HENCE AHNAF MAKES THIS PRAYER
WHEREUPON BOTH FLED BEFORE HIM AND STOOD AFAR OFF TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD DO
FN#181 KORAN IV XXII
I WAS WONT TO BE ONE OF THEM
FOR HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE DEVOTEE'S BLESSING THAT GAVE HIM THE VIC TORY AND HE SAID IN HIMSELF VERILY ON THIS HOLY MEN ALLAH LOOKETH WITH EYES OF HIS FAVOUR AND STRENGTHENETH MY PROWESS AGAINST THE INFIDELS WITH THE PURITY OF HIS PIOUS INTENT
AND IT BEFITTETH EACH MAN THAT HE RECEIVE OF IT SUCH MEASURE AS SHALL BRING HIM TO ALLAH AND THAT HE FOLLOW NOT HEREIN HIS OWN MIND AND HIS INDIVIDUAL LUST
OF TIME THAT BREEDS CALAMITY
WHAT IS LOVE'S TASTE
I WILL FLOG THY SKIN FROM THY FLESH AND CUT THY FLESH FROM THY BONES I REJOINED BY ALLAH THOU CANST DO NOTHING OF THE KIND WITH ME O MY LORD FOR THOU BOUGHTEST ME WITH MY BLEMISH
SO SHE ATE AND THE TIRE WOMAN WITH HER AND GAVE THE REST TO THE PEOPLE AND KEEPER OF THE BATH
WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAIN TELL ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFEL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE SO HE REPEATED TO HIM THE WHOLE STORY AND TOLD HIM THAT NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN WAS HIS WIFE AND RELATED TO HIM THE ADVENTURES OF ZAU AL-MAKAN FROM FIRST TO LAST

ON THIS WISE THE TWO PASSED DAYS AND NIGHTS WHILE ZAU AL-MAKAN WAS WEIGHED DOWN WITH GRIEF AND MOURNING TILL AT LAST HE SAID I LONG TO HEAR STORIES AND ADVENTURES OF KINGS AND TALES OF LOVER FOLK ENSLAVED BY LOVE

HE IS A VALIANT WIGHT AND HE KEEPETH GUARD AT OUR PALACE GATE
AND THE YOUTH KISSED THE HAND OF HIS SIRE WHO SAID O MY SON WERE I SURE THAT THOU WOULDEST DEAL JUSTLY BY ANIS AL-JALIS I WOULD GIVE HER TO THEE O MY FATHER WHAT JUSTICE AM I TO DO TO HER I ENJOIN THEE O MY SON NOT TO TAKE ANOTHER WIFE OR CONCUBINE TO SHARE WITH HER NOR SELL HER O MY FATHER
SPEAR FOR MY BROTHER
AND OF A VERY TRUTH I WILL DO WITH HIM A DEED PASSING THE POWER OF SAGE AND KNIGHT WHEREOF THE CHRONICLERS SHALL TELL CHRONICLES IN ALL COUNTRIES AND IN EVERY PLACE
WHEN IT WAS THE NINETY-THIRD NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN KING AFRIDUN HEARD THESE WORDS HE FELL INTO A FAINTING FIT WITH HIS NOSE UNDER HIS FEET
SHARRKAN MET HIM LIKE A LION AND DELIVERED A SHOULDER CUT[FN#200 WHICH CLOVE HIM TO THE MIDDLE AND THE BLADE CAME OUT GLEAMING AND GLITTERING FROM HIS BACK AND BOWELS
SO I FEARED FOR MY LIFE SITTING THERE ALONE
SO IT BESITTETH NONE TO DO THEM HARM OR HINDRANCE NOR TAKE TAX AND TITHE OF THEM TILL THEY REACH THEIR HOMES AND SAFE PLACES FOR BY MERCHANTS A COUNTRY FLOURISHETH AND THESE ARE NO MEN OF WAR NOR OF ILL FAITH THEN QUOTH THE ACCURSED ZAT AL-DAWAHI TO THOSE WITH HER VERILY I WISH TO WORK OUT A PLOT FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE MOSLEM REPLIED THEY O QUEEN COMMAND US WHATSO THOU WILT
SO LAY HANDS ON THAT WHICH IS IN THE HERMITAGE AND DIVIDE IT AMONG THE MOSLEMS AND ESPECIALLY ON FIGHTERS IN THE HOLY WAR
WHEREUPON HE RECITED LIKE A TREE IS HE WHO IN WEALTH DOTH WONE AND WHILE FRUITS HE THE FOLK TO HIS FRUIT SHALL RUN
BUT NOW WE WILL READ PRAYERS FOR YOU IN THE CHURCHES THAT THE MOHAMMEDEN HOSTS MAY BE REPELLED FROM YOU AFTER WHICH THE OLD WOMAN ZAT AL-DAWAHI CAME TO AFRIDUN AND SAID TO HIM O KING VERILY THE MOSLEM HOSTS ARE MANY AND WE SHALL NEVER OVERCOME THEM SAVE BY WILE
THEY THEN FARED FORWARDS AND CEASED NOT TRAVELLING TILL THEY REACHED ANOTHER CITY
SO SHE REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME WHILE AND THEN SAID O MY COUSIN TELL ME WHAT BEFEL THEE WITH HER THIS TIME I TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD PASSED AND SHE SAID BE PATIENT FOR THE TIME OF THY UNION IS COME AND THOU HAST ATTAINED THE OBJECT OF THY HOPES

SO NUR AL-DIN ROSE TO OPEN IT AND ONE OF HIS BOON COMPANIONS FOLLOWED HIM WITHOUT BEING PERCEIVED
NOT ONE OF THE INFIDELS COULD NEAR ME
AH NO

NOR WOULD I DO THIS BUT HOPING TO WIN THY FAVOUR
FN#310 IN POETRY IT HOLDS THE PLACE OF OUR ZEPHYR
AND IF THOU WOULDST ONLY HAVE US SET THEE ON THE RIGHT ROAD WE WILL DO SO WHEN SHARRKAN HEARD HER WORDS HE REPLIED I AM A STRANGER OF THE MOSLEMS WHO FARED FORTH THIS NIGHT SINGLE HANDED SEEKING FOR SPOIL

SO I WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND TOOK OFF THE COVER AND ATE A MOUTHFUL OF EVERY DISH AND A BIT OF MEAT
BUT I GOT AHEAD OF THEM AND ENTERED THE GARDEN BEFORE THEM AND WHEN MY MASTER SAW ME IN THIS STATE I SMITING MY FACE AND SAYING WELL AWAY

KNOW THAT I AM ONE OF THE CONCUBINES OF THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL AND MY NAME IS KUT AL-KULUB THE FOOD OF HEARTS
JEWISH AND NOT BELONGING TO THE TRIBE OF LEVI
AND IT SO CHANCED THAT ONCE UPON A TIME HE SAID TO HIS ATTENDANTS TAKE YE TEN DAYS FOOD AND FORAGE AND WHEN THEY OBEYED HIS BIDDING HE SET OUT WITH HIS SUITE FOR SPORT AND DISPORT
AFTER WHICH THEY GAVE HIM MEDICINES AND HE BEGAN TO RECOVER STRENGTH
WHEREFORE IT WERE WISER THAT I LEAVE THIS DWELLING WHILE ZAT AL-DAWAHI IS ON MY TRACK
AND LOOKING AT THE ENTERTAINER SAID TO HIM O MY LORD MAY BE THOU WILT GIVE ME LEAVE TO RETIRE AND WHY SO EARLY RETIREMENT THIS DAY
I WILL TELL THEE THE WHOLE OF THE TALE AND THE CAUSE OF OUR FEUD WITH THE KING OF CONSTANTINOPLE
THEN SHARRKAN SAID TO ZAU AL-MAKAN O MY BROTHER TELL ME THY HISTORY SO HE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM FROM FIRST TO LAST INCLUDING THE BENEVOLENT DEALING OF THE FIREMAN WITH HIM
BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MATTER OF THE DAMSEL WAS AS FOLLOWS
EXCEPT YOU WISH TO BE AT FEUD WITH ME AND DESIGN TO DISGRACE ME AND DISHONOUR MY DAUGHTER YOU WILL THE INSTANT MY LETTER REACHETH YOU SEND MY DAUGHTER BACK TO ME
AND EVERY NIGHT HE WOULD GO IN TO HER AND CONVERSE WITH HER AND PAY HIS COURT TO HER BUT SHE GAVE HIM NO ANSWER ONLY SAYING O KING OF THE AGE
AND HE EQUIPPED FOR THE MISSION TWO SHIPS ONE BEARING THE TREASURE AND THE OTHER MEN OF MIGHT TO GUARD IT FROM ANY WHO MIGHT OFFER HINDRANCE ON THE HIGH SEAS ALBEIT WELL ASSURED THAT NONE WOULD DARE WAYLAY HIS VESSELS FOR THAT HE WAS KING OF THE ARABS AND MORE BY TOKEN THAT THEIR COURSE LAY OVER WATERS SUBJECT TO THE KING OF CONSTANTINOPLE AND THEY WERE BOUND TO HIS PORT
AND I WILL BRING THEM BACK TO THEE AT THE HEAD OF THE MONTH BY WHICH TIME THOU WILT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THY FAST AND THEY WILL HAVE HAD THEIR COURSES AND BE FREE FROM IMPURITY
SO I SAT DOWN ON THE RIVER BANK TO MAKE THE ABLUTION BEFORE PRAYER
A SPECIMEN IS GIVEN IN P
I HAVE FOUND SOMEWHAT CONCERNING THY SOUL I ASKED AND WHAT IS THAT
AND HIS GLANCES FOIL THEM AND ALL RECOIL BOWING BEARDS AGROUND AND WITH FACES WAN
AND EVERY FEW DAYS HE WOULD SEND A MESSENGER TO ASK AFTER HER AND THE NEW-BORNS
AND HAVING COME UP WITH THEM HE CHARGED THE INFIDELS
HADST THOU LET ME KNOW OF HER BEFORE HER DEATH I WOULD HAVE REQUITED HER THE KINDNESS SHE DID ME IN THAT SHE SERVED ME AND UNITED THEE TO ME
WHEN KING ZAHR SHAH HEARD THESE WORDS HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND KISSED THE GROUND RESPECTFULLY BEFORE THE WAZIR WHILE THE BYSTANDERS WERE CONFOUNDED AT HIS CONDESCENSION TO THE AMBASSADOR AND THEIR MINDS WERE AMAZED
AND THE CAUSE OF THIS WAR IS AS FOLLOWS
GARDENERS ARE VERY TOUCHY ON THIS POINT
AN THOU WOULDST APPOINT SOMEWHAT BY WILL TO THEM AND TO THOSE WHO ARE POOR OF THE PEOPLE OF THY HOUSE IT WERE WELL DRAW NEAR TO ME ANSWERED HE
SHALL HE TAKE CAPTIVE MY DAUGHTER AND EVEN HER WITH SLAVE GIRLS AND PASS HER ON FROM HAND TO HAND SENDING HER FOR A GIFT TO KINGS AND THEY LIE WITH HER WITHOUT MARRIAGE CONTRACT
NOR WILL I ABANDON HIM THOUGH FOR THIS I ABIDE A REPROACH AND A BY WORD IN THE LAND OF THE GREEKS THEN SHE TOOK RECKONING OF THE DEAD AND FOUND THAT HE HAD SLAIN FOURSCORE OF THE KNIGHTS AND OTHER TWENTY HAD TAKEN TO FLIGHT.[FN#202 WHEN SHE SAW WHAT WORK HE HAD MADE WITH THEM SHE SAID TO HIM ALLAH BLESS THEE O SHARRKAN
FALL UPON IT AND SPOIL IT AND BRING HIM TO ME WITH MY SLAVE GIRL KUT AL-KULUB FOR THERE IS NO HELP BUT THAT I PUNISH HIM TO HEAR IS TO OBEY SAID JA'AFAR
HEREWITH ROSE UP AMONG THEM A WAZIR AN ANCIENT MAN DANDAN[FN#156 HIGHS WHO KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE OMAR AND SAID O KING THERE IS NOTHING BETTER TO DO IN THIS MATTER THAN EQUIP AN ARMY VALIANT AND VICTORIOUS AND SET OVER IT THY SON SHARRKAN WITH US AS HIS LIEUTENANTS

THIS MAY HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE ARABIC TRANSLATION OF THE GOSPELS MADE BY WARAKAH COUSIN TO MOHAMMED'S FIRST WIFE
THIS KURSI AL-WILADAH IS OF PECULIAR FORM ON WHICH THE PATIENT IS SEATED
THEN THEY MOUNTED AND RODE ONWARD THEY AND THEIR TROOPS TILL THEY REACHED BAGHDAD WHERE THEY ALIGHTED AND WENT UP TO THE ROYAL PALACE AND THERE THEY PASSED THAT NIGHT AND WHEN NEXT MORNING CAME ZAU AL MAKAN WENT FORTH AND BADE SUMMON THE TROOPS FROM ALL PARTS AND PROCLAIMED A HOLY WAR AND A RAZZIA.[FN#382 THEY THEN AWAITED THE COMING OF THE LEVIES FROM EACH QUARTER OF THE KINGDOM AND EVERY ONE WHO CAME THEY ENTREATED WITH HONOUR AND PROMISED HIM ALL MANNER OF GOOD

AS SOON AS SHE HAD ENDED HER DEVOTIONS HE SAID TO HER I AM DYING WITH DESIRE OF PILGRIMAGE TO THE HOLY HOUSE OF ALLAH AT MECCAH AND TO VISIT THE TOMB OF THE PROPHET UPON WHOM BE PEACE
NOT ONE OF THEM WAS SAVED
SO FAR CONCERNING THE MOSLEMS
DOST THOU KNOW HIM QUOTH HIS FRIEND YES HE HATH BEEN MY NEIGHBOUR THESE THIRTY YEARS BUT I HAVE NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM HE REPLIED VERILY THOU FORGETTEST ALLAH IN FORGETTING--THY NEIGHBOUR
AND IF I RETURN TO MY FATHER WITH WHAT FACE SHALL I MEET HIM OR WITH WHAT FACE SHALL I HAVE RECOURSE TO HIM
WHEN I WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY SHE STOPPED ME AND SAID STAY TILL I TELL THEE SOMETHING AND CHARGE THEE WITH A CHARGE SO I STAYED WHILST SHE UNFOLDED A KERCHIEF AND DREW OUT THIS PIECE OF LINEN AND SPREAD IT OPEN BEFORE ME
IT BEHOVETH THE JUDGE ALSO TO AVOID GIVING JUDGE MEET WHILST SUFFERING FROM STRESS OF PAIN OR HUNGER,[FN#333 AND THAT IN HIS DECISIONS BETWEEN FOLK HE SEEK THE FACE OF ALLAH ALMIGHTY FOR HE WHOSE INTENT IS PURE AND WHO IS AT PEACE WITH HIMSELF ALLAH SHALL GUARANTEE HIM AGAINST WHAT IS BETWEEN HIM AND THE PEOPLE QUOTH AL-ZUHRI,[FN#334 THERE ARE THREE THINGS FOR WHICH IF THEY BE FOUND IN A KAZI HE SHOULD BE DEPOSED
HAPLY SHE WILL LET US HEAR SOME DISCOURSE UPON SUBJECT OTHER THAN THIS WHEN SHE HEARD THEIR WORDS AND UNDERSTOOD THEM SHE SAID AS FOR THE CHAPTER OF GOOD BREEDING IT IS WIDE OF COMPREHENSION BEING A COMPEND OF THINGS PERFECT
AND AFTER GATHERING THE WHOLE TOGETHER THEY SET THE BOOTY IN CHESTS AND LOADED THE MULES THEREWITH

THEN I TOOK THE PIECE OF LINEN AND WENT AWAY JOYFUL AFTER WE HAD AGREED THAT I SHOULD VISIT HER EVERY NIGHT IN THE GARDEN

RELIGION IS A HIDDEN TREASURE AND THE KING IS ITS KEEPER
HE CRIED THESE YES YES AND NO
HE HAD NO DAUGHTER AND NO SON AND WAS ONLY PASSING THROUGH THE TOWN WHEN BY THE DECREE OF THE DECREER HE FELL IN WITH THIS UNHAPPY ONE
SO AS SOON AS ZAU AL-MAKAN ENTERED AND SEATED HIMSELF ON THE CARPET THE HUSBAND AROSE AND DISSOLVING SUGAR IN WILLOW FLOWER WATER MADE HIM DRINK OF IT
HENCE ABD AL-RAHMAN AL-BURAI SINGS IN HIS FAMOUS ODE HE HATH CLAIM ON THE DWELLERS IN THE PLACES OF THEIR BIRTH WHOSO WANDERETH THE WORLD FOR HE LACKETH HIM A HOME

OF THIS MORE HEREAFTER
NEXT DAY SHE MOUNTED AND RIDING TO HIS HOUSE WENT IN TO HIS WIFE WHO ROSE UP AND KISSED HER HANDS AND THANKED HER FOR HER KINDNESS
SO BE GOOD ENOUGH TO GO WITH ME AND READ TO HER THIS LETTER STANDING BEHIND THE CURTAIN WHILST I CALL HIS SISTER TO LISTEN WITHIN THE DOOR SO SHALT THOU DISPEL OUR HEED AND FULFIL OUR NEED
AND THE WAZIR DANDAN ALSO CONGRATULATED THE TWO BROTHERS AND SAID TO THEM KNOW O YE KINGS THAT ALLAH HATH GIVEN US THE VICTORY FOR THAT WE HAVE DEVOTED OUR LIVES TO HIM BE HE EXALTED AND EX TOLLED
WHO COUNTETH NOT THE MORROW AS OF HIS DAYS BUT RECKONETH HIMSELF AMONG THE DEAD AND IT IS RELATED THAT ABU ZARR[FN#339 USED TO SAY WANT IS DEARER TO ME THAN WEALTH AND UNHEAL IS DEARER TO ME THAN HEALTH QUOTH ONE OF THE LISTENERS MAY ALLAH HAVE MERCY ON ABU ZARR FOR MY PART I SAY WHOSO PUTTETH HIS TRUST IN THE GOODNESS OF THE ELECTION OF ALMIGHTY ALLAH SHOULD BE CONTENT WITH THAT CONDITION WHICH ALLAH HATH CHOSEN FOR HIM QUOTH ONE OF THE COMPANIONS OF THE PROPHET IBN ABI AUFA[FN#340 ONCE PRAYED WITH US THE DAWN PRAYER

IF THOU WILT PASS THOU OVER HERE TO ME I CANNOT DO THAT QUOTH HE AND QUOTH SHE O BOY I WILL COME ACROSS TO THEE SO SHE TUCKED UP HER SKIRTS AND LEAPING LANDED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM BY HIS SIDE

THEN TAKING OFF MY WALKING CLOTHES SHE SPREAD THEM OUT AND SAID BY ALLAH THIS IS NOT THE SCENT OF ONE WHO HATH ENJOYED HIS LOVER
41-60=661-680 FOR HIS BADAWI WIFE MAYSUN AND HER ABUSE OF HER HUSBAND SEE PILGRIMAGE III
THEN THE ISLAMITE HOST ADVANCED AND OFFERED FIGHT WITH WEAPONS READY DIGHT AND KING ZAU AL-MAKAN AND AFRIDUN MADE TO CHARGE ONE AT OTHER
AND ZAU AL-MAKAN AND HIS COMRADES OF THE MOSLEMS CEASED NOT TO SMITE THE HOSTS OF THE INFIDEL FOE AND PARTED HEADS FROM BODIES TILL DAY DARKENED AND NIGHT COMING ON STARKENED SIGHT
THEN THE PEOPLE OF THE VILLAGES AND HAMLETS AND THE POORER SORT TOOK FRIGHT AT THEM AND FLED TO CONSTANTINOPLE
THEN HE BENT FORWARDS AND CLAPPED HIS PALMS BY WAY OF CHALLENGE SHE DOING THE LIKE AND CAUGHT HOLD OF HER AND THE TWO GRAPPLED AND GRIPPED AND INTERLOCKED HANDS AND ARMS
SO WHEN SHE SAW HIM SHE LOVED HIM AND SAID O MY LORD BRING US SOMETHING TO EAT ON MY HEAD AND MINE EYES REPLIED HE
THEN HAVING PLACED HER BEFORE THE PRESENCE THE MERCHANT SAID O KING OF THE AGE BESIDES BEING PEERLESS IN HER TIME AND BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS SHE IS ALSO VERSED IN ALL LEARNING SACRED AND PROFANE INCLUDING THE ART OF GOVERNMENT AND THE ABSTRACT SCIENCES QUOTH THE KING TO THE TRADER TAKE HER PRICE ACCORDING AS THOU BOUGHTEST HER AND GO THY WAYS I HEAR AND I OBEY REPLIED THE MERCHANT
SUCH IS THE INTERPRETATION OF HER SIGNS AND MAY ALLAH ALMIGHTY DELIVER THEE FROM HER WHEN I HEARD MY COUSIN'S WORDS I BEAT MY HAND UPON MY BREAST AND CRIED OUT BY ALLAH THIS IS THE VERY TRUTH FOR I SLEPT AND LOVERS SLEEP NOT
BELIKE SHE IS ILL OR RESTLESS FOR FATIGUE OF THE JOURNEY AND THE DISTANCE OF THE PLACE FROM HER HOME AND THIS IS THE SECOND TIME SHE HATH SENT THE EUNUCH TO LOOK FOR THEE HOWEVER ZAU AL-MAKAN PAID NO HEED TO THE FIREMAN'S WORDS BUT CRIED OUT A THIRD TIME AND BEGAN VERSIFYING WITH THESE COUPLETS I FLY THE CARPER'S INJURY WHOSE CARPING SORELY VEXETH ME
IN THE TEXT THE EUNUCH KAFUR IS MADE A SANDAL OR SMOOTH-SHAVEN SO THAT HE WAS OF NO USE TO WOMEN

AND AFTER THEY HAD MADE BALES OF THE TREASURES AND MONIES AND HAD LOADED THEM UPON THE MULES AND CAMELS KING ZAHR SHAH WENT FORTH WITH HER FOR A DISTANCE OF THREE PARASANGS
HE CEASED AND HIS FELLOW BEGAN IN THESE WORDS THE TALE OF THE SECOND EUNUCH KAFUR
THEN FELL THEY TO CALLING UPON JOHN AND MARY AND THE CROSS ABHORRENT AND STAYED THEIR HANDS FROM SLAUGHTER WHILST KING AFRIDUN WENT UP TO CONSULT KING HARDUB OF GREECE FOR THE TWO KINGS STOOD ONE AT THE HEAD OF EACH WING RIGHT AND LEFT
SO HE ASKED HER WHY HAST THOU NOT INFORMED ME ALL THIS TIME THAT THOU ART THE DAUGHTER OF KING AFRIDUN LORD OF CONSTANTINOPLE THAT I MIGHT HAVE HONOURED THEE STILL MORE AND ENLARGED THEE IN DIGNITY AND RAISED THY RANK O KING ANSWERED SOPHIA AND WHAT COULD I DESIRE GREATER OR HIGHER THAN THIS MY STANDING WITH THEE OVERWHELMED AS I AM WITH THY FAVOURS AND THY BENEFITS

FOR IF THOU DO NOT THIS THEY WILL CHOOSE SOME ONE ELSE AND THOU CANST NOT BE SURE OF THY LIFE WITH ANOTHER SULTAN
AT THIS HE CRIED A CRY WHICH AROUSED ALL WHO WERE ASLEEP
THEN HE TOOK A LARGE STONE AND HAMMERED AT THE LOCK TILL HE BROKE IT AND OPENING THE LID BEHOLD A YOUNG LADY A MODEL OF BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS CLAD IN THE RICHEST OF GARMENTS AND JEWELS OF GOLD AND SUCH NECKLACES OF PRECIOUS STONES THAT WERE THE SULTAN'S COUNTRY EVENED WITH THEM IT WOULD NOT PAY THEIR PRICE
SO IF ANY DAMSEL PLEASED HER SHE WAS WONT TO TEACH HER THE ART OF RUBBING CLITORIS AGAINST CLITORIS AND WOULD ANOINT HER WITH SAFFRON[FN#411 TILL SHE FAINTED AWAY FOR EXCESS OF VOLUPTY

SHARRKAN ASKED OF HER FROM ONE OF THE SERVANTS WHO ANSWERED HIM SHE HATH GONE TO HER DORMITORY
SO SHE SEATED HERSELF BY HIS SIDE AND CAROUSED AND PLAYED WITH HIM TILL THE TWO WERE FLUSHED WITH WINE AND SHE WAS MAD FOR HER OWN DISHONOUR

I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE THE SKIRT OF MY ROBE AND WIPE MY CHEEKS WITH IT WHEN UNEXPECTEDLY THERE FELL ON ME FROM ABOVE A WHITE KERCHIEF SOFTER TO THE TOUCH THAN THE MORNING BREEZE AND PLEASANTER TO THE SIGHT THAN HEALING TO THE DISEASED
HER NAME MEANS THE CHEERER OF THE COMPANION FN#17 PRONOUNCE NOORADDEEN I GIVE THE NAME WRITTEN IN ARABIC

HOW BE CONSOLED FOR THEE THAT ART SO TENDER BOUGH
THEN HE BADE FAREWELL TO HIS SISTER AFTER HE HAD TAKEN THE JEWEL FROM HER AND HUNG IT ROUND HIS DAUGHTER'S NECK BY A CHAIN OF PURE GOLD
AND AFTER I WILL TELL THEE MY STORY REJOINED THE FIREMAN AS FOR THAT I FOUND THEE LYING ON THE RUBBISH HEAP BY THE DOOR OF THE FIRE HOUSE AS I WENT TO MY WORK NEAR THE MORNING AND KNEW NOT WHO HAD THROWN THEE THERE
THEN THEY FARED FORTH FOR BAGHDAD BUT THE CAMEL-MAN FOREWENT THEM AND SETTING GHANIM DOWN AT THE SPITAL GATE WENT AWAY WITH HIS BEAST
EVEN ABOUT THE NAME WHICH THE KORAN WRITES SAINA AND SININ THERE IS A DISPUTE
THEN SAID THE DAMSEL ASCEND O MY LORD THIS THRONE SO HE WENT UP TO IT AND SAT DOWN AND SHE WITHDREW TO REMAIN ABSENT FOR SOME TIME
SAID SHAYKH IBRAHIM WELCOME TO THE BLACKGUARD THE ROBBER THE DICER
AND SHE ANSWERED HER NAME IS NUR AL-HUDA WHEN I WENT TO MY COUSIN I FOUND HER LYING DOWN
AND THEY SLEPT BY HIS SIDE THAT NIGHT BUT HE KNEW THEM NOT
WE USUALLY ENGLISH IT BY POLYTHEISM WHICH IS CLUMSY AND CONVEYS A WRONG IDEA FN#345 GRANDSON OF THE CALIPH ALI
BUT SLEEP WAS NOT FAVOURABLE TO HIM AND THE WORLD SEEMED HEAPED UPON HIM
WHEN NIGHT FELL ALL THE FOLK WENT AWAY SORE CONCERNED FOR HIM AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HE CALLED TO MIND HIS SISTER AND HIS SICKNESS REDOUBLED ON HIM SO THAT HE ABSTAINED FROM EATING AND DRINKING AND BECAME INSENSIBLE TO THE WORLD AROUND HIM
THY FACE SHOWETH SIGNS OF GENTLE BREEDING TELL ME FIRST HOW THOU CAMEST TO FALL IN WITH ME SAID ZAU AL-MAKAN
AS A RULE THE GREATER THE DISTANCE WHICH MAY BE A MINIMUM OF ONE STEP THE HIGHER THE HONOUR
FOR NIGHT WATCHING IS THE MARK OF LOVERS DISPLAYING BRAVE ENDURANCE OF THEIR DESIRES THEN SHE TURNED TO HER WOMEN AND SIGNED TO THEM AND THEY WENT AWAY FROM HER WHEREUPON SHE CAME UP TO ME AND STRAINED ME TO HER BREAST AND KISSED ME WHILST I KISSED HER AND SHE SUCKED MY UPPER LIP WHILST I SUCKED HER LOWER LIP
THEN QUOTH TO ME MY FRIEND WHY IS THY WRITING THUS

THEY FARED ON TILL THEY REACHED THE WADY HIGHS AL-NU'UMAN A BROAD SIDED VALE HARD BY THE SALT SEA WHERE THEY HALTED THREE DAYS
AND WHEN ALL WAS IN PRESENCE HE SUMMONED THE WAZIR DANDAN AND THE EMIRS RUSTAM AND BAHRAM AND TARKASH AND THE GRAND CHAMBERLAIN
INDEED THE LIKE OF SUCH WOMAN MAY BE INSTANCED BY A SALT AND MARSHY SOIL WHICH IF ONE TILL FOR EVER IT YIELDETH ONLY WORTHLESS GROWTH AND NO ENDURANCE SHOW ETH
AND LASTLY BESTOWED UPON HIM A SPLENDID DRESS OF HONOUR
TO ME HE SUGGESTS A PURITAN A COVENANTER OF THE SOUREST AND NARROWEST TYPE

WHEN THIS IS DONE GO DOWN WITH ME TO THE SLAVE MARKET AND SELL ME AS THOU BOUGHTEST ME TO WHOSO WILL BUY ME WITH MY BLEMISH

THE HOST OF AL-ISLAM CALLED OUT SAYING ON THE PRINCE OF MANKIND BE BLESSINGS AND PEACE AND TO THE COMPASSIONATE GLORY AND PRAISE WHICH NE'ER SHALL CEASE FOR HIS BOONS WHICH AYE INCREASE AND THE HOST OF THE INFIDELS SHOUTED GLORY TO THE CROSS AND THE BELT AND THE VINE PRESS JUICE AND THE WINE PRESSER AND THE PRIESTS AND THE MONKS AND THE FESTIVAL OF PALMS AND THE METROPOLITAN NOW ZAU AL-MAKAN AND SHARRKAN HELD BACK AND THEIR TROOPS GAVE WAY AND FEIGNED FLIGHT FROM BEFORE THE ENEMY WHILE THE INFIDEL ARRAY PRESSED HARD UPON THEM DEEMING THEM IN ROUT AND MADE READY TO FOIN AND HEW
NOW WHILE SO DOING HE LOOKED AT THE ACCURSED OLD WOMAN WHO WAS WAVING HER SWORD AND HEARTENING THEM AND ALL WHO FEARED FLED TO HER FOR SHELTER

I WILL COME TO THEE AGAIN AT DAYBREAK KHALID BIN SAFWAN FURTHER RELATES THAT THE MAN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AT DAWN AND BEHOLD THE KING HAD PUT OFF HIS CROWN AND RESOLVED TO BECOME AN ANCHORITE FOR THE STRESS OF HIS EXHORTATION
AND AS THE DAY BROKE GHANIM ROSE AND DONNED HIS CLOTHES AND GOING TO THE BAZAR AS WAS HIS WONT TOOK WHAT THE OCCASION REQUIRED AND RETURNED HOME
AL-MU'IN ALSO WENT HIS WAYS AT ONCE WITH HIS RAIMENT DYED OF THREE COLOURS BLACK WITH MUD RED WITH BLOOD AND ASH COLOURED WITH BRICK-CLAY
WHEN HE WENT FROM ME EVERY MATTER WENT WRONG TILL MY HEART WAS NIGH-BROKEN MY NATURE UNMANNED
AND HE PUT UNDER HER ASTROLOGERS AND MATHEMATICIANS TO WHOM HE APPOINTED STIPENDS AND ALLOWANCES
THE WAZIR WENT OFF AND HE WAS GLAD AND GAY AND ORDERED THE CHIEF OF POLICE TO MAKE THE AFORE-MENTIONED PROCLAMATION
THAT NIGHT SEEMED LONGSOME TO ME AS IT WERE A YEAR
THEY UNBELIEVERS SHALL BE THROWN THEREIN I.E THE HOUSE OF PERDITION=HELL
IN THE MURK OF WHOSE NIGHT IS FOUND NO LIGHT AND DARKNESS AND DAY ARE THE SAME IN HER SIGHT
THEN HE TOOK THE MISSIVE AND WENT IN WITH IT TO NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN WHO KNEW NOT THAT HE WAS HER BROTHER NOR HE THAT SHE WAS HIS SISTER ALBEIT HE OFTEN VISITED HER BOTH BY NIGHT AND BY DAY TILL THE MONTHS WERE ACCOMPLISHED AND SHE SAT DOWN ON THE STOOL OF DELIVERY
BUT IT CONTRASTS STRONGLY WITH OUR CIVILISED FORM BEING A TRIAL OF ENDURANCE RATHER THAN OF SPEED
A MODERN DIVINE PREFERRED HIM TO ALL CHARACTERS IN HISTORY FN#463 TRAVEL BY NIGHT SAID THE PROPHET WHEN THE PLAGUES OF EARTH SCORPIONS SERPENTS ETC AFFLICT YE NOT YET THE NIGHT MARCH IN ARABIA IS DETESTABLE PILGRIMAGE III FN#464 THIS FORM OF CEREMONY IS CALLED ISTIKBAL COMING FORTH TO GREET AND IS REGULATED BY THE SEVEREST LAWS OF ETIQUETTE
ALAS THE CHILDREN OF THE MISTRESS AND SAID MY MISTRESS AND HER CHILDREN ARE ALL DEAD EVERY ONE OF THEM THEN HE LOOKED ROUND AND SEEING ME WITH MY TURBAND RENT IN RAGS ROUND MY NECK HOWLING AND WEEPING WITH EXCEEDING WEEPING AND THROWING DUST UPON MY HEAD HE CRIED OUT AT ME
WHEN IT WAS THE THIRTY-EIGHTH NIGHT SHE CONTINUED IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE CALIPH SAID TO NUR AL-DIN ALI I WILL WRITE THEE A LETTER TO CARRY TO THE SULTAN MOHAMMED BIN SULAYMAN AL-ZAYNI WHICH WHEN HE READETH HE WILL NOT HURT NOR HARM THEE IN AUGHT NUR AL-DIN ASKED WHAT
SHE HATH NOT HER EQUAL IN THIS AGE FOR SHE IS PERFECT IN PROPORTION AND SYMMETRY BLACK EYED AS IF KOHL DYED AND LONG LOCKED WEE OF WAIST AND HEAVY OF HIP
AND COMING NIGH TO HIM MADE THE SPEAR HE HENT TO SHAKE AS IT WERE A DARTING SNAKE AND RECITED THESE COUPLETS I HAVE A SORREL STEED WHOSE PRIDE IS FAIN TO BEAR THE REIN SHALL GIVE THEE WHAT THOU LIKEST NOT AND MAKE THEE FEEL HIS MAIN
AND WE SAT AWAITING HIM TILL THE END OF THE DAY BUT HE DID NOT COME OUT AND WE SAID PERCHANCE HE IS TIRED WITH THE BATH AND WITH WATCHING BY NIGHT AND FASTING BY DAY
LET NOT THE PAIR DELUDE WITH CUNNING ART
FOR I SEE THAT THEY FEAR ME AND CANNOT PREVAIL AGAINST ME BUT EVERY ONE WHO ASSAILETH ME TURNETH TAIL AND TAKETH FLIGHT SO THEY BATTLED THE REST OF THE DAY AND WHEN NIGHT FELL THE MOSLEMS TOOK REFUGE IN A CAVE OF THAT DEFILE BEING WEARY WITH STRESS OF WAR AND CAST OF STONE
AND THE ARMIES OF AL-ISLAM DREW NEAR AS IT WERE THE SWOLLEN SEA FOR THE MULTITUDE OF FOOTMEN AND HORSEMEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN
AND I ABSTAINED FROM MEAT AND DRINK AND ESTRANGED MYSELF FROM THE SOLACE OF SLEEP TILL MY COLOUR WAXED YELLOW AND I LOST MY GOOD LOOKS
WHEN IT WAS THE SIXTY-THIRD NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT NUZHAT AL ZAMAN CONTINUED KNOW O KING THAT MU'AYKIB WAS INTENDANT OF THE PUBLIC TREASURY DURING THE CALIPHATE OF OMAR BIN AL-KHATTAB
BUT AS REGARDS KING SHARRKAN HE PASSED THAT NIGHT IN THE CAVERN WITH HIS COMRADES AND WHEN DAWNED THE DAY AND HE HAD PRAYED THE MORN PRAYER HE AND HIS MEN MADE READY TO DO BATTLE WITH THE INFIDEL AND HE HEARTENED THEM AND PROMISED THEM ALL GOOD
AND WEAN HIM FROM SUCKING OF MILK FOR SOON A SWEETER DRINK THE FOE'S BLOOD HE'LL DRAIN THEN THE MIDWIVES TOOK THE NEWBORN CHILD AND CUT THE NAVEL CORD AND DARKENED HIS EYELIDS WITH KOHL POWDER[FN#466 AND NAMED HIM TAJ AL-MULUK KHARAN.[FN#467 HE WAS SUCKLED AT THE BREAST OF FOND INDULGENCE AND WAS REARED IN THE LAP OF HAPPY FORTUNE
AND DRAG THEM BOTH ON THEIR FACES WITH THEIR ARMS PINIONED BEHIND THEM THEY REPLIED TO HEAR IS TO OBEY AND ARMING THEMSELVES THEY SET OUT FOR THE HOUSE OF NUR AL-DIN ALI
WHEN KING HARDUB HEARD THIS THE WORLD GREW BLACK IN HIS SIGHT AND HE WEPT WITH SORE WEEPING
AND HE CEASED NOT TO HOLD HER IN CONVERSE ON THE HIGHWAY TILL THEY CAME WITHOUT THE CITY OF JERUSALEM AND WHEN OUTSIDE HE JOINED HIS COMPANIONS AND FOUND THEY HAD MADE READY THE DROMEDARIES
AND ALLAH BLESS HIM WHO SAITH WARE HOW THOU HURTEST MAN WITH HURT OF HEART
NEVER WHAT IS TO BE DONE ASKED THE SULTAN AND THE MINISTER ANSWERED LEAVE HIM TO ME AND I WILL TAKE HIM AND KEEP HIM AWAY FROM THEE AND SEND HIM IN CHARGE OF A CHAMBERLAIN TO BAGHDAD-CITY
AND THEY SET OUT AND CEASED NOT WAYFARING FOR SIX DAYS TILL THEY REACHED DAMASCUS
HE WILL GIVE THEE A WRITTEN ORDER UPON SOME OF HIS AGENTS AND WILL SEND AFTER THEE TO SAY TO THEM PAY HIM NOTHING SO AS OFTEN AS THOUGH SHALT GO IN QUEST OF THE COIN THEY WILL SAY WE'LL PAY THEE PRESENTLY AND THEY WILL PUT THEE OFF DAY AFTER DAY AND THOU ART PROUD OF SPIRIT
IF THOU FEAR NO ONE I FEAR FOR THEE AND FOR MY LIFE SO ALLAH UPON THEE
SINCE ALLAH ALMIGHTY HATH MADE THE WORLD FOR HIS SERVANTS AS VIATICUM TO THE TRAVELLER FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS GOAL
IF YOUR HEART BE AS HARD AS WHAT HE HAD PINCHED I AM A LOST MAN FN#15 NA'IMAN IS SAID TO ONE AFTER BATHING OR HEAD-SHAVING
58 AND III
THEN BEGAN HE TO ASK HER OF THE THREE JEWELS AFORESAID AND SHE ANSWERED HERE BE THEY WITH ME O KING OF THE AGE SO SAYING SHE ROSE AND GOING TO HER LODGING UNPACKED HER BAGGAGE AND FROM IT BROUGHT OUT A BOX AND FROM THE BOX A CASKET OF GOLD
THEN I GAVE MYSELF UP TO LOVE DELIGHTS AND THOUGHT NO MORE OF MY COUSIN'S DEATH
AND TERROR AND A SENSE OF DESOLATION OPPRESSED HIM FOR THAT HE WAS ALONE AMIDST THE TOMBS
THOU KNOWEST THAT THEY FATHER BOUGHT ME FOR TEN THOUSAND DINARS
LET HIM BITE SO I BITE THOSE BEAUTEOUS LIPS OF THE LUSCIOUS RED
HER PASSION FOR HIM INCREASED WITH HIS FORBEARANCE

AND THOU O CHAMBERLAIN SHALT TAKE MY PLACE IN COUNCIL AND CONTRIVANCE WHILE THOU O RUSTAM SHALT BE MY BROTHER'S DEPUTY IN BATTLE
WHEN THEY SIGHTED THE SAILS OF THE SHIP WHEREIN SOPHIA AND HER WOMEN WERE THEY GAVE CHASE IN ALL HASTE AND IN LESS THAN AN HOUR THEY CAME UP WITH HER THEN THEY LAID THE GRAPPLING IRONS ABOARD HER AND CAPTURED HER

PROBABLY IT WAS CONFOUNDED WITH THE JANEO BRAHMANICAL THREAD AND THE PARSI SACRED GIRDLE CALLED KASHTI
WHEN HER PROTOHISTORIC TRIBE JADIS HAD DESTROYED ALL THE RIVAL RACE OF TASM EXCEPT RIBAH IBN MURRAH
THEN HE SENT FOR THE DAMSEL ANIS AL-JALIS AND BESTOWED PLENTIFUL FAVOURS UPON THEM BOTH AND GAVE THEM ONE OF HIS PALACES IN BAGHDAD AND ASSIGNED STIPENDS AND ALLOWANCES AND MADE NUR AL-DIN ALI BIN FAZL BIN KHAKAN ONE OF HIS CUP-COMPANIONS
NOW THE FIRST TO REACH SHARRKAN WAS THE WAZIR DANDAN,--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
BY FORCE CRIED I
I HAVE SEEN A HALE AND HEARTY ARAB AFTER SITTING AN HOUR IN THE MOONLIGHT LOOK LIKE A MAN FRESH FROM A SICK BED
THEY CEASED NOT ON THIS WISE TILL THE TIME OF THE UNDER MEAL WHEN THE ATTENDANTS BROUGHT FORWARD THE TABLES OF FOOD IN THAT SALOON AND ALL ATE TILL THEY WERE SATED
BUT WHEN KING AFRIDUN HEARD THE TIDINGS HE AROSE AND BETOOK HIMSELF TO ZAT AL-DAWAHI THE SAME WHO HAD CONTRIVED THE STRATAGEM AND HAD TRAVELLED TO BAGHDAD AND HAD SLAIN KING OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN
THIS MAN IS BUT ONE AND YE ARE AN HUNDRED KNIGHTS
FN#301 AMONGST MOSLEMS AS AMONGST CHRISTIANS THERE ARE SEVEN DEADLY SINS

THE LASHES OF THY LOVER'S EYNE SHALL PIERCE THEE THROUGH THOU HAST MY PRINCE OF LOVELINESS
BE OF GOOD PATIENCE AND ALLAH SHALL INCREASE THY REWARD
WHEREUPON THEY SEIZED THE TWO WITHOUT TELLING THEM THE CAUSE AND AFTER SPOILING THE HOUSE CARRIED THEM BEFORE THE VICEROY
AND SHE SAID TO HIM BE NOT ASHAMED
I WILL RECOMPENSE HIM WHENAS I RETURN FROM THIS RAID"--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY

BIKR IS THE USUAL FORM BUT BAKR PRIMARILY MEANING A YOUNG CAMEL IS METAPHORICALLY APPLIED TO HUMAN YOUTH LANE'S LEX
SO LEAVE THY BLAMING LET ME YEARN AND PINE NOW THE HANDSOME YOUTH KNEW NOT THE AFFAIR OF THE DAMSEL
AND THEY CONTINUED PRESSING FORWARD TILL THEY APPROACHED THE CAMP OF AL-ISLAM WHERE SHARRKAN FOUND THE MOSLEM IN CONQUERED PLIGHT AND THE CHAMBERLAIN UPON THE BRINK OF FALLING BACK IN FLIGHT WHILST THE SWORD OF GREECE HAVOC DIGHT AMONG THE FAITHFUL THE RIGHTEOUS AND THOSE WHO WORK UPRIGHT,--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY

FROM HER WERE OR CLAIMED TO BE DESCENDED THE HAFSITES WHO REIGNED IN TUNIS AND EXTENDED THEIR POWER FAR AND WIDE OVER THE MAGHRIB MAURITANIA TILL DISPOSSESSED BY THE TURKS
THEN THEY WENT FORTH AND SHUTTING THE DOOR DISAPPEARED FROM GHANIM'S EYES
MOREOVER HE HAD THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY CONCUBINES AFTER THE NUMBER OF DAYS IN THE COPTIC YEAR WHO WERE OF ALL NATIONS
AND THE FLOWERS ARE A GLOWING AND THE TREES ARE BLOWING AND THE STREAMS ARE FLOWING SO NUR AL-DIN LANDED HE AND HIS HANDMAID AND GIVING THE CAPTAIN FIVE DINARS WALKED ON A LITTLE WAY TILL THE DECREES OF DESTINY BROUGHT THEM AMONG THE GARDENS AND THEY CAME TO A PLACE SWEPT AND SPRINKLED WITH BENCHES ALONG THE WALLS AND HANGING JARS FILLED WITH WATER.[FN#41 OVERHEAD WAS A TRELLIS OF REED-WORK AND CANES SHADING THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE AVENUE AND AT THE UPPER END WAS A GARDEN GATE BUT THIS WAS LOCKED

VERILY OUR LABOUR IS LOST AND OUR HEARTS ARE HEAVY WITHIN US FOR OUR SULTAN IS A PRISONER AND THOSE WHO ARE WITH HIM THEN THEY CUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY WIDE AND SIDE NIGHT AND DAY AND WHEN MORNING DAWNED THEY REACHED THE HEAD OF THE DEFILE AND SAW ZAU AL-MAKAN AND SHARRKAN SHOUTING
MORE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE HATH COME TO US FROM ROUMLAND AN OLD WOMAN OF SAINTLY BEARING AND WITH HER BE FIVE DAMSELS HIGH BOSOMED VIRGINS ENDOWED WITH KNOWLEDGE AND GOOD BREEDING AND ALL ARTS AND SCIENCES BEFITTING MORTALS TO KNOW
IT IS THE TIME FOR WORSHIPPING THE REQUITING KING THEN SHE STOOD UP IN THE PRAYER NICHE AND REMAINED PRAYING TILL THE NIGHT WAS SPENT
WHEN IT WAS THE SIXTIETH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT KING SHARRKAN BADE THEM WRITE FOR THE MERCHANT A MANDATE AFTER PAYING HIM HIS MONIES
AND SHE CALLED TO MIND HER BROTHER AND HIS SICKNESS AND FORLORN CONDITION AND HOW THEY WERE BOTH STRANGERS IN A FAR COUNTRY WHICH CRAVE HER TEARS DOWN HER CHEEKS AND SHE WEPT SILENTLY AND BEGAN REPEATING TIME HATH FOR HIS WONT TO UPRAISE AND DEBASE NOR IS LASTING CONDITION FOR HUMAN RACE
AND EXCEPT YE LEAVE OFF FIGHTING US WE WILL SLAY YOU TO THE LAST MAN
AND WARNED ME TO FLEE FROM THE CITY AFAR DISAPPEAR DISAPPOINT WHAT MY ENEMIES PLANNED

SO SHE TURNED TO HIM AND SAID O ACCURSED OLD MAN O GRAY BEARD OF HELL HOW HAVE I TRUSTED THEE AND THOU HAST PLAYED ME FALSE AND NOW THOU WOULDST TORTURE ME WHEN HE HEARD HER REPLY HE CRIED OUT O LAZY BAGGAGE DOST THOU DARE TO BANDY WORDS WITH ME AND HE STOOD UP TO HER AND BEAT HER WITH A WHIP SAYING AN THOU HOLD NOT THY PEACE I WILL KILL THEE SO SHE WAS SILENT AWHILE THEN SHE CALLED TO MIND HER BROTHER AND THE HAPPY ESTATE SHE HAD BEEN IN AND SHE SHED TEARS SECRETLY
HAPLY ALLAH MAY OPEN THEE A WAY TO GET THE SAME PRICE AND IF IT BE HIS WILL TO BRING US ONCE MORE TOGETHER WE SHALL MEET AGAIN O ANIS AL JALIS CRIED HE BY ALLAH IT IS NO LIGHT MATTER FOR ME TO BE PARTED FROM THEE FOR A SINGLE HOUR BY ALLAH O MY LORD SHE REPLIED NOR IS IT EASY TO ME EITHER BUT NEED HATH ITS OWN LAW AS THE POET SAID NEED DRIVES A MAN INTO DEVIOUS ROADS AND PATHWAYS DOUBTFUL OF TREND AND SCOPE

AND WHEN ANOTHER TROOP ATTACKED HIM HE REPELLED THE ASSAULT WITH THE SWORD IN THEIR BACKS

IT HATH QUENCHED IN ME ANGUISH WHICH BURNED AS A FIRE OF GHAZA-WOOD.[FN#49 THEN THEY SAT DOWN AND SHAYKH IBRAHIM SET FOOD BEFORE THEM

THE CALIPH WOULD SURELY NOT SEND HIM TO TAKE THE SULTANATE FROM THEE WITHOUT THE IMPERIAL AUTOGRAPH[FN#70 AND THE DIPLOMA OF INVESTITURE AND HE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE DESPATCHED WITH HIM A CHAMBERLAIN OR A MINISTER
IN SIMILAR GUISE DID ALL THE EMIRS AND GRANDEES AND OFFICERS OF STATE BRINGING HIM GIFTS AND CALLING DOWN BLESSINGS ON HIM AND SAYING TO HIM HAPLY THOU WILT MENTION OUR CASE TO SULTAN ZAU AL-MAKAN AND SPEAK TO HIM TO CONTINUE US IN OUR DIGNITIES."[FN#325 THE CHAMBERLAIN PROMISED ALL THEY REQUIRED AND BADE HIS PAGES BE READY TO MARCH WHEREUPON THE WAZIR DANDAN SENT WITH HIM TENTS AND BADE THE TENT PITCHERS SET THEM UP AT A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM THE CITY

AND XXXV THE SPACE OR THE PLACE BETWEEN DEATH AND RESURRECTION WHERE SOULS ARE STOWED AWAY
IF THEY KNOW OF THIS THEY WILL BE EMBOLDENED TO ATTACK US IN THEIR ABSENCE AND WITH THE SWORD THEY WILL ANNIHILATE US TO THE LAST MAN
AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO HIS BROTHER HE SAID IF SHE BRING THEE A SON I WILL GIVE HIM MY DAUGHTER KUZIA FAKAN TO WIFE AT THIS ZAU AL-MAKAN REJOICED AND THEY FELL TO CONGRATULATING EACH OTHER ON THE VICTORY OVER THE ENEMY
BUT WHEN SHE SAW HIM SHE CHECKED HERSELF AND SMILING THROUGH HER TEARS SAID THOU HAST DESOLATED ME O BELOVED OF MY HEART
I REPLIED SOOTH TO SAY SHE IS DEAD AND WE HAVE CAUSED ZIKR LITANIES AND RECITATIONS OF THE KORAN TO BE PERFORMED FOR HER
AND IF THEY BE BAD THE PEOPLE WILL BE BAD EVEN THE OLEMA AND THE EMIRS AND IT IS SAID BY A CERTAIN SAGE THERE BE THREE KINDS OF KINGS THE KING OF THE FAITH THE KING WHO PROTECTETH THINGS TO WHICH REVERENCE IS DUE AND THE KING OF HIS OWN LUSTS THE KING OF THE FAITH OBLIGETH HIS SUBJECTS TO FOLLOW THEIR FAITH AND IT BEHOVETH HE BE THE MOST FAITHFUL,[FN#261 FOR IT IS BY HIM THAT THEY TAKE PATTERN IN THE THINGS OF THE FAITH
SO THEY AGREED UPON THIS AND HE FARED FORTH AND TOOK PASSAGE FOR HIMSELF AND HER AND THEY MADE READY AND SET OUT IN THE SHIP WITH A COMPANY OF JERUSALEM PALMERS
AND THE FIRST WHO PREACHED FROM A PULPIT AND WHO LEANT ON A SWORD OR A STAFF WHEN DISCOURSING
179 BY PLACING THE HAPPY SOULS IN THE CROPS OF GREEN BIRDS WHICH EAT OF THE FRUITS AND DRINK OF THE WATERS OF PARADISE
THEN HE GAVE ORDERS TO SWEEP A BENCH BEHIND THE DOOR AND SPREADING ON IT A SITTING-RUG AND A LEATHER-CLOTH SEATED NUR AL-DIN THEREON AND LOOSED HIS SHACKLES AND ENTREATED HIM KINDLY
HE HAD LITTLE HAIR ON THE CHEEKS BUT A LONG MUSTACHIO WITH REDDISH ENDS
AFTERWARDS CALLED KHORASAN
AS FOR HER GESTURE WITH THE POT OF GREEN PLANTS IT MEANT WHEN THOU COMEST ENTER THE FLOWER GARDEN WHICH IS BEHIND THE STREET
AND SHE CARRIED THEM AGAIN TO THE BATHS AND WHEN THEY CAME OUT AND HAD CHANGED THEIR RAIMENT SHE LED THEM BACK TO THE SYNDIC'S HOUSE AND LEFT THEM THERE WHILST SHE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND CRAVED PERMISSION TO SEE THE CALIPH
OF A KING
501 TRANSLATED BY CARLYLE MILITES BY SCHULTENS SAGITTARIUS AND BY JARETT PICKED TROOPS FN#91 THIS FAMILIARITY WITH BLACKAMOOR SLAVE-BOYS IS COMMON IN EGYPT AND OFTEN ENDS AS IN THE STORY
SO HE ASKED THE CAUSE OF THIS AND THEY GAVE HIM TIDINGS OF THE DEATH OF KUT AL-KULUB WHEREON HE FELL A SWOONING
FN#466 THIS SERVES TO KEEP THE BABE'S EYES FREE FROM INFLAMMATION
THAT I MAY TAKE IT IN MY HAND AND THRUST IT INTO MY VERY VITALS AND SHE CEASED NOT TO EXCITE ME WITH SOBS AND SIGHS AND AMOROUS CRIES IN THE INTERVALS OF KISSING AND CLASPING UNTIL AMID OUR MURMURS OF PLEASURE WE ATTAINED THE SUPREME DELIGHT AND THE TERM WE HAD IN SIGHT
THEY BOTH WEPT FOR THEIR FATHER AND ASKED THE MANNER OF HIS BEING KILLED
SO I CONCEALED MY CASE TILL THIS YEAR WHEN I WROTE TO CERTAIN FRANKISH CORSAIRS AND SOUGHT NEWS OF MY DAUGHTER FROM THE KINGS OF THE ISLES
THE IMAM ABU HANIFAH[FN#367 WAS WONT ALSO TO PASS HALF THE NIGHT IN PRAYER
BY ALLAH WERE SHE THY COUSIN THOU HADST BORNE HER THE SAME LOVE AS SHE BORE THEE
FN#474 IT WAS NOT RESPECTFUL TO PITCH THEIR CAMP WITHIN DOG-BARK
AND I WILL FOLLOW THEIR EXAMPLE IN RELATING WHAT HATH REACHED ME OF THE FAMOUS MEN OF PAST TIMES
AND DOING HIM ALL MANNER OF SERVICE AND KINDNESS TILL HEALTH BEGAN TO RETURN TO HIS BODY AND ZAU AL-MAKAN OPENED HIS EYES
AND WHEN THE CALIPH USED TO ENTER HE WOULD ORDER THE HANDMAIDS TO THROW OPEN THE LATTICES AND LIGHT UP THE ROOMS
THEN THEY SPREAD TAPESTRY ABOUT OUR HOUSE AND SET OUT THEREON WHAT WAS NEEDFUL AFTER THEY HAD HUNG ITS WALLS WITH CLOTH OF GOLD
99=717 AND THE FIFTH OF THE ORTHODOX FAMED FOR A PIETY LITTLE KNOWN TO HIS HOUSE
WHILST THE BUILDING OF THE CONVENT BY JUSTINIAN BELONGS TO A.D 527

I I MAY ADD THAT SHAHRAZAD IN THE SHAMS AL-LOGHAT IS THE P.N
IF MAN SHOULD CAST A FURTIVE GLANCE OR STEAL FAR LOOK AT HER HIS HEART IS BURNT BY DEVIL-BOLTS SHOT BY THOSE PIERCING EYNE WHEN THE WAZIR SAW HER SHE MADE HIM MARVEL WITH EXCESS OF ADMIRATION SO HE TURNED PERFECTLY PLEASED TO THE BROKER AND ASKED WHAT IS THE PRICE OF THIS GIRL
WHEN THEY CAME IN TO HER THEY FOUND THE EUNUCHS STANDING BEFORE HER
AND PAUPERS
AND NOW SHE IS DEAD I FEAR FOR THEE FROM THE CRAFTY ONE'S PERFIDY AND MISCHIEF
FN#105 NAMES OF HER SLAVE-GIRLS WHICH MEAN IN ORDER GARDEN-BLOOM DAWN OR BEAUTIFUL TREE O PEARL P
TABZIR
THEN THE WIFE OVER TURNED THE FURNITURE OF THE HOUSE ONE THING UPON ANOTHER AND TORE DOWN THE SHELVES AND BROKE THE WINDOWS AND THE LATTICES AND SMEARED THE WALLS WITH MUD AND INDIGO SAYING TO ME WOE TO THEE O KAFUR
MY DEATH AT YOUR HANDS WHAT BRINGS IT OF GLORY
MEANWHILE THE STOKER WENT TO THE MARKET AND BOUGHT SOME ROSE WATER AND SUGAR AND SPRINKLED ZAU AL-MAKAN'S FACE WITH THE WATER AND GAVE HIM TO DRINK OF THE SHERBET
WHAT BE THIS ABUNDANCE OF LICE ON THY GABERDINE O MY LORD REPLIED HE THEY MAY ANNOY THEE JUST AT FIRST BUT BEFORE A WEEK IS PAST THOU WILT NOT FEEL THEM NOR THINK OF THEM THE CALIPH LAUGHED AND SAID TO HIM OUT ON THEE
NIMSA SOUTHERN GERMANS AUSTRIANS
IN THIS HER PURPOSE WAS TO DIVIDE THE MOSLEM FORCES THE BETTER TO WEAKEN THEM
INDEED I HAD NOT DEEMED THEE SO ILL CONDITIONED
FN#484 MUSK IS ONE OF THE PERFUMES OF THE MOSLEM HEAVEN
FN#155 THIS BIT OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION IS NOT IN THE BULL EDIT
SHE TOOK IT AND DRANK IT OFF
FN#512 THE WEIGHT WOULD BE ROUND
THE LOGOS OR SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY NOT A SAINTESS THE SENDING A CHRISTIAN GIRL AS A PRESENT TO A MOSLEM WOULD IN THESE DAYS BE CONSIDERED HIGHLY SCANDALOUS
AND THIS IS ALL MY TALE QUOTH ZAU AL-MAKAN GLORY TO HIM WHO QUICKENETH THE BONES THOUGH THEY BE ROTTEN
NICEPHORUS
THERE UPON THE MOSLEMS ADDRESSED THEMSELVES AGAIN TO THE SIEGE OF THE CITY AND THE SULTAN PROMISED HIS MEN THAT IF IT SHOULD BE TAKEN HE WOULD DIVIDE ITS TREASURES AMONG THEM IN EQUAL PARTS
AND OF ZAU AL-MAKAN HOW THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE HAD MADE HIM KING OVER THEM IN THE STEAD OF HIS SIRE
BUT MY SPIRIT AS THEY WENT WITH THEM WENT AND SO I CRIED AH RETURN YE BUT REPLIED SHE ALAS
FOR TRULY HE IS A PIOUS MAN WHO FREQUENTETH THE ELDERS OF THE FAITH AND THE FAKIRS AND OTHER RELIGIOUS MENDICANTS AND ENTERTAINETH THEM
NONE SHOULD NAME THE SON SAVE HIS SIRE REJOINED THE BADAWI NONE SHALL NAME IT BUT THOU THYSELF QUOTH THE MERCHANT TO HIMSELF THIS WILDLING IS A RUDESBY AND A MAGGOTTY HEAD
ALL ENTER WITHOUT PAYING
AND WE MAKE KNOWN TO ALL WHO FALL UPON THIS SCROLL THAT SHARRKAN WHEN HE CAME TO OUR COUNTRY SEDUCED OUR QUEEN ABRIZAH
NEXT HE SUCKED HER TONGUE AND SHE SUCKED HIS AND LASTLY HE LOOSED THE STRINGS OF HER PETTICOAT-TROUSERS AND ABATED HER MAIDENHEAD
ALLAHO AKBAR THIS WISE THEIR COMPANY WILL SURELY BE DISSOLVED NOR WILL THEY FIND OUT THE TRICK FOR THEY ARE DRUNK BUT THEY WILL THINK THAT THE MOSLEM TROOPS HAVE ENCOMPASSED THEM ABOUT ON ALL SIDES AND HAVE MINGLED WITH THEM
BUT WHEN THEY ARE RECITED THEY LACK THE SIJDAH OR PROSTRATION
THEN TOOK HE PASSIONATELY TO CHASING AND HUNTING WHICH HE WOULD HARDLY LEAVE FOR A SINGLE HOUR
NOW HIS SOLE OBJECT IN DOING ALL THIS WAS TO HEAR THE DAMSEL SING
SO HE SENT HER SHERBETS AND SUGAR ELECTUARIES
FN#319 KAUSAR AS HAS BEEN SAID REPRESENTS THE CLASSICAL NECTAR THE AMRITA OF THE HINDUS
OPEN THY HAND TO THEM IN TIME OF SUCCESS AND STINT THEM NOT IN TIME OF DISTRESS THERE IS A LEGEND THAT A DESERT ARAB CAME ONCE TO THE CALIPH AL MANSUR[FN#262 AND SAID STARVE THY DOG AND HE SHALL FOLLOW THEE WHEN THE CALIPH HEARD HIS WORDS HE WAS ENRAGED WITH THE ARAB BUT ABU L-ABBAS OF TUS SAID TO HIM I FEAR THAT IF SOME OTHER THAN THOU SHOULD SHOW HIM A SCONE THE DOG WOULD FOLLOW HIM AND LEAVE THEE ALONE THEREUPON THE CALIPH AL-MANSUR'S WRATH SUBSIDED AND HE KNEW THAT THE WILD ARAB HAD INTENDED NO OFFENCE AND ORDERED HIM A PRESENT
I LOOKED AT THE WINDOW A SECOND TIME BUT FOUND IT SHUT AND WAITED PATIENTLY TILL SUNDOWN BUT SENSED NO SOUND AND SAW NO ONE IN VIEW
AND IF MY WIFE WILL LISTEN TO AND OBEY ME AND ACCOMPANY ME I WILL TAKE UP MY ABODE THERE

WE WILL NOT MARCH FROM IT SAVE AFTER THREE DAYS THAT WE MAY TAKE REST OURSELVES AND THAT THE ARMY OF AL-ISLAM MAY REGAIN STRENGTH AND THEIR SOULS BE FORTIFIED TO ENCOUNTER THE BLAMED INFIDELS SO THEY HALTED THEREIN AND WHILE CAMPING BEHOLD THEY HEARD A NOISE OF VOICES FROM AFAR AND ZAU AL-MAKAN ASKED THE CAUSE THEREOF AND WAS ANSWERED THAT A CARAVAN OF MERCHANTS FROM THE LAND OF SYRIA HAD HALTED THERE TO REST AND THAT THE MOSLEM TROOPS HAD COME ON THEM AND HAD HAPLY SEIZED SOMETHING OF THE GOODS WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE INFIDELS
FOR THOU ART NOW IN AN OPEN PLAIN AND DID WE SHOUT BUT A SINGLE SHOUT WOULD COME TO OUR RESCUE FOUR THOUSAND KNIGHTS.[FN#170 SO TELL ME WHAT THOU WANTEST
NOR DID THEY CEASE TO CALL TO ME AND COAX ME TILL THEY TOOK ME FROM WHERE I WAS

AND AFTER HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE TEN DAYS THEREOF ON THE ELEVENTH HE OPENED THE GUGGLET AND DRANK WHAT WAS THEREIN AND FOUND IT CORDIAL TO HIS STOMACH
FN#249 THE BADAWI WHO WAS FOOL AS WELL AS ROGUE BEGINS TO FEAR THAT HE HAS KIDNAPPED A GIRL OF FAMILY
AS SOON AS PRAYERS WERE OVER THEY DREW NEAR HIM

HE WHO OBEYETH HIS OWN INCLINATION NEGLECTETH HIS DUTIES AND HE WHO LISTENETH TO THE SLANDERER LOSETH THE TRUE FRIEND
AND SHARRKAN WAS GOING FORTH TO THE PLAIN BUT BEHOLD MORE THAN ONE HALF OF THE FRANKS DISMOUNTED AND REMAINED ON FOOT BEFORE ONE OF THEM WHO WAS MOUNTED TILL THEY REACHED THE MIDST OF THE BATTLE PLAIN
AND I TELL THEE THE REASON OF MY RAGE AND HIDE NOTHING FROM THEE
THEN ROSE A MAN OF TATTERED APPEARANCE AND SAID O FOLK BEWARE OF A TRUTH WHICH BRINGETH UNWEAL FOR THERE IS NO HARM IN A LIE BRINGING WEAL,[FN#352 AND IN TIME OF NEED NO CHOICE WE HEED

AND AFTER FUMIGATING HIM AND RUBBING HIS PALATE WITH THE HOLY MERDE CAUSED HIM TO SNUFF IT AND SMEARED HIS CHEEKS AND ANOINTED HIS MOUSTACHES WITH THE REST
SO THE MINISTER ALIGHTED AND FARED ON A FOOT TILL HE CAME TO A LOFTY SALOON AT WHOSE UPPER END STOOD A MARBLE COUCH SET WITH PEARLS AND STONES OF PRICE AND HAVING FOR LEGS FOUR ELEPHANT'S TUSKS
WHEN IT WAS THE FORTY-EIGHTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE NAZARENE DAMSEL SAID TO SHARRKAN AND HE LISTENING IMPATIENTLY ENOW VERILY IF SHARRKAN FELL INTO MY HANDS I WOULD GO FORTH TO HIM IN THE HABIT OF A MAN AND DRAG HIM FROM HIS SADDLE SEAT AND MAKE HIM MY CAPTIVE AND LAY HIM IN BILBOES PRIDE AND PASSION AND KNIGHTLY JEALOUSY TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM AND HE DESIRED TO DISCOVER AND DECLARE HIMSELF AND TO LAY ON LOAD
HOW FRESH AND BRIGHT THE DOWN THAT DECKS HIS CHEEK AND YET BURSTEN GALL BLADDERS FEED WHICH E'EN AS WATERS WELL AND AS SAITH ANOTHER I MARVEL HEARING PEOPLE QUESTIONING OF THE FOUNT OF LIFE AND IN WHAT LAND TIS FOUND
HOW SHOULD I DO AS THOU SAYEST WHEN I WOT THAT IF I CAME TO THAT KING OF YOURS OMAR BIN AL NU'UMAN I SHOULD NEVER GET FREE FROM HIM

NOR COULD I MAKE THE MATTER PUBLIC LEST REPROACH BEFAL ME AMONGST THE KINGS BY REASON OF MY DAUGHTER'S HONOUR
DOST THOU DEEM ALL FOLK ARE ALIKE WHEN THE VILE SLAVE HEARD THIS FROM HER HE WAXT MORE ENRAGED AND HIS EYES GREW REDDER

WHEN SHE DRAWETH NIGH SHE SEDUCETH AND WHEN SHE TURNETH HER BACK[FN#461 SHE SLAYETH
FIL WITH THE ARTICLE AL-FIL WHENCE THE GREEK GREEK LETTERS THE SUFFIX--AS BEING DEVOTED TO BARBAROUS WORDS AS OBOD-AS AL UBAYD ARETAS AL-HARIS ETC
THEN SHE UNSHEATHED THE PONIARD AND WENT UP TO SHARRKAN'S HEAD AND SHE DREW THE KNIFE ACROSS HIS THROAT AND SEVERED HIS WEASAND AND HEWED OFF HIS HEAD FROM HIS BODY
THEN THEY LOOKED FOR THE OPENING OF THE CITY GATE
WHO IS FOR SMITING
AND THEREBY MY LONGING WAXED MORE VIOLENT AND MY PASSION AND DISTRACTION REDOUBLED ON ME
WHEN THEY TOOK ME AND FOUND NO PATH BUT FLIGHT FOR DREAD OF DEATH
THEN SHE ENTERED FASTER THAN A FLASH OF BLINDING LEVEN AND HAD NAUGHT TO DO BUT TO SHUT THE DOOR
AND WHEN HE COMETH SEIZE ON HIM AND FRIGHTEN HIM
THAT SLEEP HATH FED MINE EYELIDS OF THY KNOWLEDGE WITNESS BEAR THEN SHE WALKED ON WEEPING AND TURNING RIGHT AND LEFT AS SHE WENT WHEN BEHOLD THERE ESPIED HER AN OLD BADAWI[FN#241 WHO HAD COME INTO THE TOWN FROM THE DESERT WITH WILD ARABS OTHER FIVE
THEN SHE TURNED TO GHANIM AND PLACING HER HANDS BEFORE HER FACE SAID TO HIM IN THE SWEETEST SPEECH O BLESSED YOUTH WHO BROUGHT ME HITHER
FOR I HAVE BEEN HERE ON RAZZIA WITH KING OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN WHAT WHILE WE BESIEGED CONSTANTINOPLE
AND THEY DREW OUT IN BATTLE ARRAY BUT INDEED THEY WERE FULL OF ALARM AND AFFRAY
BEING ASKED THE CAUSE OF THIS HE REPLIED KNOW YE NOT BEFORE WHOM I STAND AND WHOM I ADDRESS IT IS SAID THAT THERE LIVED NEAR SUFYAN AL-THAURI[FN#346 A BLIND MAN WHO WHEN THE MONTH OF RAMAZAN CAME WENT OUT WITH THE FOLK TO PRAY,[FN#347 BUT REMAINED SILENT AND HUNG BACK
FOR HERE WE BE LIKE BIRDS IN CAGE THEN SHARRKAN WAXED WROTH AND SIGHED FOR EXCESS OF RAGE AND STRETCHED HIMSELF TILL HIS PINION BONDS BRASS ASUNDER
MAY ALLAH NOT HAVE THEE IN HIS HOLY KEEPING FOR THIS THY CRAFT AND KEENNESS OF WIT
SUCH WAS HIS CASE
AND HE HATH ALSO FORWARDED BY US SOMEWHAT OF VARIOUS KINDS OF PRESENTS AND OF THE KING'S GRACE HE BEGGETH THEIR ACCEPTANCE AND THE FRIENDLY BOON OF FURTHERANCE THEN THE AMBASSADORS KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE HIM,--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
AFTER WHICH NUR AL-DIN WENT UP TO ONE OF THE LATTICED WINDOWS AND CALLING TO HIS HANDMAID FELL TO GAZING ON THE TREES LADEN WITH ALL MANNER FRUITS
AND THE RELIGIOUS STROKED SHARRKAN'S WOUND WITH HIS HAND CHANTING SOMEWHAT OF THE KORAN AND REPEATING BY WAY OF TALISMAN SOME OF THE VERSES OF THE COMPASSIONATE ONE
AND EVERY MONTH OR TWO THE KNIGHT CAME TO THE HERMITAGE
I HAVE SEEN A MOSLEM WILD WITH RAGE ON HEARING A CHRISTIAN PARODY THE OPENING WORDS OF THE KORAN BISMILLAHI L RAHMANI L-RAHIM MISMISH WA KAMAR AL-DIN ROUGHLY TRANSLATED IN THE NAME OF ALLAH THE COMPASSIONATING THE COMPASSIONATE
THEN THE YOUNG LADY WENT UP TO THE OLD ONE AND THROWING A WRAPPER OF THIN SILK UPON HER NAKEDNESS HELPED HER TO DON HER CLOTHES AND MADE EXCUSES SAYING O MY LADY ZAT AL DAWAHI I INTENDED ONLY TO THROW THEE AND NOT ALL THIS BUT THOU TRIEDST TO TWIST OUT OF MY HANDS
118 ALLAH MAKES ABRAHAM AN IMAM TO MANKIND FN#352 A FAVOURITE SENTIMENT IN THE EAST

BY THE SINGLE TIP CAT STICK AND THE CUBE OF BONE WHICH SHE PLACED UPON THY STOMACH SHE SAITH TO THEE THY BODY IS PRESENT BUT THY HEART IS ABSENT
WHY SHOULD THE BLAMER GAR THEE BLAMING BOW
MY FREEDOM STOLE THAT FAIREST SHE AND PARTING IRKS ME BITTERLY WHEN SHE ENDED HER VERSE SHE LOOKED AT SHARRKAN AND FOUND HIM LOST TO EXISTENCE AND HE LAY FOR A WHILE STRETCHED AT FULL LENGTH AND PRONE AMONG THE MAIDENS.[FN#191 THEN HE REVIVED AND REMEMBERING THE SONGS AGAIN INCLINED TO MIRTH AND MERRIMENT
I SWEAR TO THEE THAT VERILY I WILL NOT DO HER INJUSTICE IN EITHER WAY HAVING SWORN TO THAT EFFECT NUR AL-DIN WENT IN TO THE DAMSEL AND ABODE WITH HER A WHOLE YEAR WHILST ALLAH ALMIGHTY CAUSED THE KING TO FORGET THE MATTER OF THE MAIDEN
FN#141 CHINA
AND ILLUMINATE THE GLOOM WITH A GLEAMING GREED
KNOW O MASLAMAH THAT I WAS PRESENT EVEN AS THOU WHEN SUCH AN ONE OF THE SONS OF MARWANWAS BURIED AND I FELL ASLEEP BY HIM AND SAW HIM IN A DREAM GIVEN OVER TO ONE OF THE PUNISHMENTS OF ALLAH TO WHOM BELONG HONOUR AND GLORY
FN#251 THIS IS ACCORDING TO STRICT MOSLEM LAW
IT BEHOVETH THOU BE SALTED LEST THE STOMACH EJECT THEE
THE CALIPH WENT UP TO THE GATE AND FINDING IT WIDE OPEN WAS SURPRISED AND SAID SEE O JA'AFAR HOW SHAYKH IBRAHIM HATH LEFT THE GATE OPEN AT THIS HOUR CONTRARY TO HIS CUSTOM THEY WENT IN AND WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME UNDER THE PAVILION WHEN THE CALIPH SAID O JA'AFAR I WISH TO LOOK IN UPON THEM UNAWARES BEFORE I SHOW MYSELF THAT I MAY SEE WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT AND GET SIGHT OF THE ELDERS
INDEED I SPAKE HIM SOOTH BUT NE'ER HIS EAR COULD GAIN
AND I OWE MY LIFE TO HIM SAID SHE ALLAH WILLING WE WILL REQUITE HIM FOR ALL THIS ACCORDING TO OUR POWER THEN SHE CALLED THE EUNUCH WHO CAME AND KISSED ZAU AL MAKAN'S HAND AND SHE SAID TAKE THY REWARD FOR GLAD TIDINGS O FACE OF GOOD OMEN
BUT AS REGARDS THE GREEKS AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR REFUSING TO FIGHT DURING THESE THREE DAYS THE CASE WAS THIS
ALL THE PEOPLE HEARD THE STRAIN AND THE WHOLE MOVING BODIES OF THE ARMIES TWAIN CALLED TO MIND THE DAY OF COMPLAIN
WITHAL THEY HAVE MISSED THEE ALL THIS TIME AND THEY WOT NOT WHAT TO DO WHEN SHARRKAN HEARD HER WORDS HE WAS ABSENT AWHILE IN THOUGHT
SO I STOOD BEHIND HIM[FN#351 MAKING THE PRAYER BOW TILL THE MU'EZZIN CALLED HIS CALL
AND IF I COME TO HIM HE WOULD NOT PROVE SHY OF ME FOR YOUR FOLK BELIEVE I AM LAWFUL TO HAVE AND TO HOLD AS IS SAID IN YOUR WRIT OR THOSE WOMEN WHOM YOUR RIGHT HAND SHALL POSSESS AS SLAVES.'[FN#181 SO HOW CANST THOU SPEAK THUS TO ME
AND WHEN SHE HEARD IT SHE WEPT WITH MUCH WEEPING AND REPEATED THE FOLLOWING VERSES HOW SHALL YOUTH CURE THE CARE HIS LIFE UNDO'TH AND EVERY DAY HIS HEART IN PIECES HEW'TH
BUT NOW I SEE WHAT MISCHIEF THERE IS IN THY HEART AND HOW THOU CANST PERMIT THYSELF A SPEECH WHICH PROVETH THY TRAITOROUS INTENT
SHE CAME UP TO ME LAUGHING AND SAID SO
INSHAD WHICH MAY MEAN RECITING THE VERSE OF ANOTHER OR IMPROVISING ONE'S OWN
I KINGS XXI
THEN HE SLIPPED IT DOWN TO HER WAIST AS FAR AS HER NAVEL
WHO WAS IT BADE THEE NOT BELONG TO ME
BUT ALLAH WILL SUCCOUR US AGAINST THEM
IT IS STILL MY CONVICTION THAT THE TRUE MOUNT SINAI WILL BE FOUND IN JABAL ARAIF OR SOME SUCH UNIMPORTANT HEIGHT TO THE NORTH OF THE MODERN HAJJ ROAD FROM SUEZ TO AKABAH
NAY SHE LEFT ME CONFOUNDED AND KNOWING NOT WHAT SIGNIFIED HER SIGNS.[FN#489 I TARRIED SITTING THERE TILL SUPPER TIME AND DID NOT RETURN HOME TILL NEAR MIDNIGHT
THE WAZIR SENT EVERY DAY ENJOINING THE JAILOR TO BEAT HIM BUT HE ABSTAINED FROM THIS AND SO CONTINUED TO DO FOR FORTY DAYS
NOR DRUNKEN AS ONE WHO DRINKS WINE BUT DRUNK WITH NIGHT DRAUGHT HIS LIPS OF THE HONEY DEW LENT
NOW WHEN THE MINISTER SAW THIS HE ROSE TO HIS FEET AND AFTER COMPLIMENTING THE KING A SECOND TIME AND KISSING THE GROUND BEFORE HIM SPAKE AS FOLLOWS O MIGHTY KING AND DREAD LORD
AND BEHOLD HE WALKED TO THE DOOR OF THE DAMSEL'S CHAMBER AND OPENING IT WENT IN AND ASKED HER ART THOU SHE MY FATHER BOUGHT FOR ME AND SHE ANSWERED YES THEREUPON THE YOUTH WHO WAS WARM WITH WINE CAME UP TO HER AND EMBRACED HER
I WAS BROUGHT UP IN HIS PALACE AND WHEN I GREW TO WOMAN'S ESTATE HE LOOKED ON ME AND NOTING WHAT SHARE OF BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS THE CREATOR HAD GIVEN ME LOVED ME WITH EXCEEDING LOVE AND ASSIGNED ME A SEPARATE APARTMENT AND GAVE ME TEN SLAVE GIRLS TO WAIT ON ME AND ALL THESE ORNAMENTS THOU SEEST ME WEARING
SO THEY STAYED HIM IN HIS SADDLE AND RETURNED WITH HIM TO HIS BROTHER ZAU AL-MAKAN
THEN SAID HE TO THE FISHERMAN GET THEE ABOUT THY BUSINESS
THE HUGE ORANGE WHICH CAPTAIN SHADDOCK BROUGHT FROM THE WEST INDIES
WHENEVER THE CARAVAN HALTED THEY SERVED HIM WITH FOOD AND HE AND THE CASTRATO ATE FROM ONE DISH.[FN#322 THEN THE EUNUCH BADE HIS LADS BRING A GUGGLET OF SUGARED SHERBET AND AFTER DRINKING HIMSELF GAVE IT TO THE FIREMAN WHO DRANK
I HAVE OFTEN TAKEN BENEFIT OF THE MOSQUE BUT AS A RULE IT IS UNPLEASANT THE MATTING BEING NOT ONLY TORN BUT OVER-POPULOUS
PARE SOFTLY FORTUNE'S NATURE IS TO GUILE AND END OF EVERY MEETING IS TO PART AND WHEN SHE ENDED HER RECITATION SHE SAID O MY COUSIN GIVE ME THIS PIECE OF LINEN SO I GAVE IT TO HER AND SHE TOOK IT AND UNFOLDING IT SAW WHAT WAS THEREIN
I WILL THANK THEE AND THANK WHILEAS LIFE SHALL LAST AND MY BONES WILL PRAISE THEE IN GRAVE ENGRAVED HARDLY HAD THE FISHERMAN ENDED HIS VERSE WHEN THE LICE BEGAN TO CRAWL OVER THE CALIPH'S SKIN AND HE FELL TO CATCHING THEM ON HIS NECK WITH HIS RIGHT AND LEFT AND THROWING THEM FROM HIM WHILE HE CRIED O FISHERMAN WOE TO THEE
AND SHE CONTINUED WEEPING AND CRYING OUT THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG WHILE THEY JOURNEYED ON MAKING FOR THE MOUNTAINS IN FEAR ANY SHOULD SEE THEM
THIS TRADITION IS STILL HELD BY THE ISRAELITES SAYS MR RODWELL P
THE WICKET OPENED AND SHE PUT OUT HER HEAD LAUGHING
NOW HE WAS A LONG BEARDED MAN[FN#278 AND I SAW THE SMOKE ISSUING FROM BETWEEN THE HAIRS OF HIS BEARD TILL THE FLOUR WAS COOKED WHEN HE TOOK SOME OF THE FAT AND THREW IT IN AND SAID TO THE WOMAN BED THEM WHILE I COOL IT FOR THEM SO THEY FELL TO EATING TILL THEY HAD EATEN THEIR FILL AND HE LEFT THE REST WITH HER
AND XXXIII A'ARABI IS THE CLASSICAL WORD AND THE ORIGIN OF ARAB IS DISPUTED
AFTER WHICH BOTH SET OUT FORCING THEIR MARCHES TO REJOIN THEIR ARMY
AND THEY WEPT FOR HIM AND PITYING HIS CONDITION TOOK COUNSEL WITH ONE ANOTHER UPON HIS CASE AND AGREED TO FORWARD HIM TO THE HOSPITAL IN BAGHDAD.[FN#127 MEANWHILE BEHOLD TWO BEGGAR WOMEN WHO WERE NONE OTHER THAN GHANIM'S MOTHER AND SISTER,[FN#128 CAME INTO THE MOSQUE AND WHEN HE SAW THEM HE GAVE THEM THE BREAD THAT WAS AT HIS HEAD
SUCH WAS THE CASE WITH THEM
MR RODWELL MAKES IT NO
FURTHERMORE DO THOU TELL THE SON OF MY UNCLE THE WHOLE STORY OF NUR AL-DIN AND HOW I SENT HIM WITH MY WRITTEN ORDERS
THE OPEN COLLAR OF THE SAUB TOBE OR LONG LOOSE DRESS IS SYMPTOMATIC
MOREOVER HE APPOINTED FOR THEM EUNUCHS AND ATTENDANTS AND DOCTORS OF LAW AND DOCTORS OF PHILOSOPHY AND ASTROLOGERS AND PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS TO DO THEM SERVICE
JOY HATH SO OVERWHELMED ME THAT EXCESS OF PLEASURE FROM MINE EYES DRAWS GOUTS OF BRINE
WHILST THEIR JOY INCREASED AND THEY DOVE IN CLOSER LOVE EACH TO EACH GLORY BE TO THE UNITER OF HEARTS THEY CEASED NOT TO CAROUSE AFTER THIS FASHION TILL NEAR UPON DAWN WHEN DROWSINESS OVERCAME THEM AND THEY SLEPT WHERE THEY WERE APART EACH FROM OTHER TILL THE MORNING.[FN#108 THEN GHANIM AROSE AND GOING TO THE MARKET BOUGHT ALL THEY REQUIRED OF MEAT AND VEGETABLES AND WINE AND WHAT NOT AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE HOUSE
SO HE SENT US TO THE LORD OF THE AGE AND THE TIME SULTAN OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN KING OF BAGHDAD AND OF KHORASAN DESIRING THAT HE AID US WITH AN ARMY SO MAY HONOUR AND GLORY ACCRUE TO HIM
SWEAR THIS TO ME FOR I FEAR THY TREACHERY
SO HE REMOVED THITHER WITH SISTER AND MOTHER

WHEN THE MOSLEMS WERE UNITED THEIR HEARTS WERE STRENGTHENED AND THEY CRIED OUT SAYING VERILY ALLAH HATH PRO MISED US VICTORY AND TO THE INFIDELS HATH ASSIGNED DEFEAT AND THEY CLASHED TOGETHER WITH SWORD AND SPEAR
THEN THEY ALL MADE FOR THE MOSLEM HOST AS HATH ERST BEEN SAID
UNLIEF THY SIN I SEE:[FN#115 THE HART ERST HUNTED I
AND HE REPLIED HERE AM I O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL IS ALL WELL THEY WANT THE FISH FRIED SAID THE CALIPH AND JA'AFAR ANSWERED O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL GIVE IT TO ME AND I'LL FRY IT FOR THEM BY THE TOMBS OF MY FORBEARS QUOTH THE CALIPH NONE SHALL FRY IT BUT I WITH MINE OWN HAND SO HE WENT TO THE GARDENER'S HUT WHERE HE SEARCHED AND FOUND ALL THAT HE REQUIRED EVEN TO SALT AND SAFFRON AND WILD MARJORAM AND ELSE BESIDES
BY ALLAH EACH DAMSEL OF THEM IS WORTH MANY TIMES THY KINGDOM HE SAID I KNOW IT O PIOUS LADY THEN QUOTH THE OLD WOMAN THERE IS NO HELP BUT THAT THOU SEND WITH THEM SOMEONE IN THY PALACE WHO IS DEAR TO THEE THAT SHE MAY FIND SOLACE AND SEEK A BLESSING OF THE INVISIBLE CONTROULS QUOTH HE I HAVE A GREEK SLAVE CALLED SOPHIA BY WHOM I HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH TWO CHILDREN A GIRL AND A BOY
WHEREFORE CONTINUE O SHARRKAN TO OBEY MY COMMANDMENT IN SUBMISSION TO ALLAH BE HE EXALTED AND EXTOLLED FOR I MEAN TO SLAY TEN KINGS IN BLOOD REVENGE FOR MY SIRE TO CUT THE THROAT OF FIFTY THOUSAND GREEKS AND TO ENTER CONSTANTINOPLE REPLIED SHARRKAN MY LIFE BE THY RANSOM AGAINST DEATH
AND HE SAID TO HER O KUT AL-KULUB I FIND THOU ACCUSES ME OF TYRANNY AND OPPRESSION AND THOU AVOUCHES THAT I HAVE DONE ILL BY ONE WHO DID WELL BY ME
WHEREFORE I PURPOSE TO WORK UPON THEM BY GUILE AND REPAIR TO THIS ARMY OF AL-ISLAM HAPLY I MAY WIN MY WISH OF THEIR LEADER AND SLAY THEIR CHAMPION EVEN AS I SLEW HIS FATHER
WHILST ZAU AL-MAKAN SMOTE UPON THE MEN AND GARRED THE KNIGHTS BITE THE DUST AND THEIR HEADS FROM THEIR BODIES TAKE FLIGHT FIVE BY FIVE AND TEN BY TEN TILL HE HAD DONE TO DEATH A NUMBER OF THEM PAST NUMBERING AND AN ACCOMPT BEYOND COUNTING
53-55 FN#46 THE GOOD OLD MAN TREATED THE YOUTH LIKE A TIRED CHILD
BUT SAT DOWN WITH HER ARMS ROUND HER KNEES AND BOWING HER HEAD UPON HER COLLAR BEGAN TO LOOK INTO HER CASE AND HER ABASEMENT AFTER HER LOT OF HIGH HONOUR
HAPLY IT MAY BRING THEE RELIEF FOR ALLAH'S AID IS EVER NEARHAND O FISHERMAN SAID NUR AL-DIN WILT THOU HEAR OUR HISTORY IN VERSE OR IN PROSE PROSE IS A WORDY THING BUT VERSES REJOINED THE CALIPH ARE PEARLS ON STRING THEN NUR AL-DIN BOWED HIS HEAD AND MADE THESE COUPLETS O MY FRIEND
THEN SHE DOFFED HER HAUBERK AND HE SAID TO HER O LADY MINE WHEREFORE DIDST THOU DON THAT COAT OF MAIL AND BARE THY BRAND TO GUARD THEE AGAINST THESE CAITIFFS,"[FN#204 SHE REPLIED
BUT AS REGARDS THE WAZIR HE ABODE IN HIS STEAD TILL NIGHT WAS HALF SPENT[FN#463 AND THEN SET OUT FOR THE CITY
FN#316 IN SUCH CARAVANS EACH PARTY MUST KEEP ITS OWN PLACE UNDER PAIN OF GETTING INTO TROUBLE WITH THE WATCHMEN AND GUARDS
THIS IS THE DECREE OF ALLAH THEY SOJOURNED IN THAT PLACE AWHILE HIS WEAKNESS EVER INCREASING AND SHE ATTENDING HIM AND BUYING NECESSARIES FOR HIM AND FOR HERSELF TILL ALL THE MONEY SHE HAD WAS EXPENDED AND SHE BECAME SO POOR THAT SHE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS A DIRHAM LEFT
SHE WENT IN TO THY SIRE AND SALUTED HIM
WHEREUPON THE DOZD WENDS HIS WAY HAVING LOST HIS BOOTY AS HIS EXTREME STUPIDITY DESERVED
NAME HER AS THOU WILT QUOTH HE IT IS USUAL TO NAME CHILDREN ON THE SEVENTH DAY AFTER BIRTH.[FN#300 THEN HE BENT OVER THE CHILD TO KISS IT AND HE SAW HUNG ABOUT ITS NECK A JEWEL WHICH HE KNEW AT ONCE FOR ONE OF THOSE WHICH PRINCESS ABRIZAH HAD BROUGHT FROM THE LAND OF THE GREEKS
ONE YEAR IT CHANCED THAT AMONGST THE DAUGHTERS OF THE GREAT WHO RESORTED TO THE PATRON AS WAS THEIR CUSTOM CAME A DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF CONSTANTINOPLE A BEAUTIFUL GIRL CALLED SOPHIA
SO COME LET US PUSH OUT OF THIS DEFILE ERE THE INFIDEL HOST INCREASE ON US AND GET THE START OF US TO THE MOUNTAIN TOP WHENCE THEY WILL HURL DOWN ROCKS UPON US AND WE POWERLESS TO COME AT THEM SO THEY BEGAN HURRYING ON TO GET OUT OF THOSE NARROWS
KNOWING NOT THAT THE THREE HAD MADE FOR THE MONASTERY
THE TITLE MEANS MISTRESS OF MISFORTUNES OR QUEEN OF CALAMITIES TO THE ENEMY
HIS BREATH WAXED FETID AND HIS WHOLE CONDITION WAS CHANGED
AND WHAT THE FORCE THAT TURNS AWAY MY SIGHT WHEN I HEARD HER VERSE CARK INCREASED AND CARE REDOUBLED ON ME AND I FELL DOWN IN A CORNER OF OUR HOUSE
220=833 IN FACT FEW OF THE NOTABLE REVERENDS OF THAT DAY ESCAPED WITHOUT A CARESS OF THE SCOURGE OR THE SWORD
SO DO NOT THOU COMMIT SIN ON ME FOR I AM A STRANGER AND COME FROM THE HOLY CITY OF JERUSALEM
AS SOON AS DAWNED THE MORN THE TROOPS SPRUNG TO HORSE WHEN THEY HAD DONNED THEIR ARMOUR GEAR AND DRAWN THE SCYMITAR AND SLUNG THE SPEAR
WHEN THE EVENING CAME AND DARKNESS STARKENED THEY LIGHTED CANDLES RIGHT AND LEFT FROM THE GATE OF THE CITADEL TO THAT OF THE PALACE
WHEN SHE SAW IT STANDING WITH HEAD ERECT SHE HENT IT IN HAND AND BEGAN RUBBING IT UPON THE LIPS OF HER LITTLE SLIT[FN#92 OUTSIDE HER PETTICOAT TROUSERS
AND THE EMIRS AND WAZIRS AND HIGH DIGNITARIES CAME TO THE PALACE AND WISHED KING OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN JOY OF HIS SON ZAU AL-MAKAN AND OF HIS DAUGHTER NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN WHEREFORE HE THANKED THEM AND BESTOWED ON THEM DRESSES OF HONOUR AND FURTHER FAVOURED THEM WITH GIFTS AND DEALT LARGESSE TO ALL GENTLE AND SIMPLE WHO WERE PRESENT
RIPE-FRUITFUL BRANCH OF NEVER SULLIED RACE
AND SAYING TO THE WOMAN LEAVE IT TO ME HE BEGAN BLOWING THE FIRE UNDER THE CAULDRON
WHEREUPON THE MOSLEMS WERE ABOUT TO BREAK AND RETREAT AND TAKE FLIGHT WHEN MEANWHILE BEHOLD UP CAME SHARRKAN WITH THE REST OF THE HOST OF AL-ISLAM AND THE STANDARDS OF THE BELIEVERS IN UNITY
DEEM WHAT THOU WILT OF US FOR LOVE BY CALUMNIES THE SWEETER IS NOR AFTER THIS CARE I ONE JOT WHETHER MY FOE BE KNOWN OR NOT THEN HIS AFFECTION INCREASED AND LOVE FIRES ROSE HOTTER IN HIS HEART WHILE SHE REFUSED HERSELF TO HIM SAYING THOU CANST NOT POSSESS ME THEY CEASED NOT TO MAKE LOVE AND ENJOY THEIR WINE AND WASSAIL WHILST GHANIM WAS DROWNED IN THE SEA OF LOVE AND LONGING
AND HE REPEATED THESE COUPLETS HO THOU ABRIZAH MERCY
PRESENTLY CAME IN THE FIREMAN AND SEEING HIM SITTING UP AND SHOWING SIGNS OF AMENDMENT SAID TO HIM WHAT IS NOW THY STATE O MY SON PRAISE BE TO ALLAH REPLIED ZAU AL-MAKAN I AM WELL AND LIKE TO RECOVER IF SUCH BE THE WILL OF ALLAH ALMIGHTY AT THIS TIME THE STOKER PRAISED THE LORD OF ALL FOR THIS AND WENDING FAST TO THE MARKET BOUGHT TEN CHICKENS WHICH HE CARRIED TO HIS WIFE AND SAID KILL TWO OF THESE FOR HIM EVERY DAY ONE AT DAWN OF DAY AND THE OTHER AT FALL OF DAY SO SHE ROSE UP AND KILLED A FOWL AND BROUGHT IT TO HIM BOILED AND FED HIM WITH THE FLESH AND MADE HIM DRINK ITS BROTH
LAUD TO ALLAH WHO HATH SHOWN US THY FACE IN SAFETY AND INDEED SHE WAS CONFOUNDED AND HER REASON FLED WHEN SHE SAW HIM AND SHE ASKED O MY LORD HOW DIDST THOU ESCAPE THOU AND THY FRIENDS THE MERCHANTS
FN#82 ARAB
AND AS SHE CAME UP TO THEM SHE SAID TO ONE IN THE GREEK TONGUE ARISE AND TAKE THE REINS OF HIS HORSE AND CONDUCT HIM ACROSS INTO THE CONVENT SO SHE WENT UP TO SHARRKAN AND LED HIM OVER MUCH PUZZLED AND PERTURBED WITH WHAT HE SAW AND SAYING TO HIMSELF O WOULD THAT THE WAZIR DANDAN WERE HERE WITH ME THAT HIS EYES MIGHT LOOK UPON THESE FAIREST OF FAVOURS THEN HE TURNED TO THE YOUNG LADY AND SAID TO HER O MARVEL OF LOVELINESS NOW I HAVE TWO CLAIMS UPON THEE
THEN SHE TOOK SEAT AND TALKED TO ME WHILST I PRAYED ALLAH TO HASTEN THE DAWN
THEN WENT THEY TO THEIR MOTHER WHO JOYED IN THEIR JOY AND WISHED THE KING LONG LIFE
HER HOLINESS WOULD ACT LIKE A FASCINATING TALISMAN
THEN THE CALIPH WENT UP TO THE DOOR OF THE PAVILION AND KNOCKED A GENTLE KNOCK WHEREUPON SAID NUR AL-DIN O SHAYKH IBRAHIM SOME ONE TAPS AT THE DOOR WHO GOES THERE CRIED THE SHAYKH AND THE CALIPH REPLIED IT IS I O SHAYKH IBRAHIM WHO ART THOU QUOTH HE AND QUOTH THE OTHER I AM KARIM THE FISHERMAN
IF LIVING MAN COULD SWIM UPON HIS TEARS I FIRST SHOULD FLOAT ON WATERS OF THESE EYNE
BUT IF YOU SLIGHT MY LETTER AND DISOBEY MY COMMANDMENT I WILL ASSUREDLY MAKE YOU FULL RETURN FOR YOUR FOUL DEALING AND THE BASENESS OF YOUR PRACTICES.'[FN#209 WHEN MY FATHER READ THIS LETTER AND UNDERSTOOD THE CONTENTS,[FN#210 IT VEXED HIM AND HE REGRETTED NOT HAVING KNOWN THAT SOPHIA KING AFRIDUN'S DAUGHTER WAS AMONG THE CAPTURED DAMSELS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SENT HER BACK TO HER SIRE
AS HE AND THE MERCHANTS CAME FORTH FROM THE GARDEN GATE BEHOLD THEY SAW A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST AND HEARD A LOUD NOISE OF CRYING AND LAMENTATION
WHEN IT WAS THE NINETY-SEVENTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE DAMNED WITCH ZAT AL-DAWAHI TOOK THE HEAD OF THE KNIGHT THE LEADER OF THE TWENTY THOUSAND INFIDELS SHE BROUGHT IT AND THREW IT DOWN BEFORE ZAU AL-MAKAN AND HIS BROTHER SHARRKAN AND THE WAZIR DANDAN SAYING WHEN I SAW YOUR CONDITION I WAXED JEALOUS FOR YOUR HONOUR
SUCH WAS THE CASE WITH SHARRKAN AND HIS MEN
NOR DID THEY CEASE FIGHTING UNTIL DAY DARKENED AND NIGHT STARKENED
THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS SO CALLED USE SIMILAR FORMS OF INVERTED SPEECH
AND THE WOMEN ABOUT THE DAMSEL BEHIND THE CURTAINS BEGAN TO WISH HER JOY AND KISS HER HANDS AND FEET WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT SHE WAS BECOME THE KING'S WIFE
BUT TIS GRIEVOUS TO ME TO PART FROM THEE AND I KNOW NOT WHAT WILL BECOME OF THEE AFTER MY DEPARTURE GO NOW TO THINE ARMY SHE REPLIED AND TURN THEM BACK WHILE YE ARE YET NEAR YOUR OWN COUNTRY

HERE DEEMING THEMSELVES SAFE THEY HALTED TO REST
AND THE CASTRATO SAID TO THEM IF A HAIR OF HIM BE LOST YOU WILL BE LOST WITH IT AND HE BADE THEM PRIVILY TREAT HIM WITH HONOUR AND NOT HUMILIATE HIM

AND NOTHING DROVE IT OUT OF MY MIND BUT THESE TWO FIGURED GAZELLES AND I THREW THE PIECE OF LINEN ON THE FLOOR BEFORE HER
BUT FIRST HE TOSSED THE JAVELIN WITH ONE HAND IN AIR TO SUCH HEIGHT THAT IT WAS LOST TO THE SPECTATORS SIGHT
SO WHATSO THOU WILLEST DO IT IN MY CASE SHE HUNG HER HEAD GROUNDWARDS A LONG WHILE THEN TURNED TO HIM AND SAID BE OF GOOD CHEER AND LET THINE EYES BE COOL AND CLEAR;[FN#187 FOR THOU ART THE GUEST OF MY HOSPITALITY AND BREAD AND SALT HATH MADE A TIE BETWEEN ME AND THEE

AND WHEN THE MONTH WAS ENDED HE WENT FORTH AND SAT ON HIS SOFA OF STATE AND DISPENSED JUSTICE TO HIS SUBJECTS TILL THE MONTHS OF HER PREGNANCY WERE ACCOMPLISHED
SO THEY CAME AND ATE AND DRANK

MAY THE MESSIAH ON THEIR FATHERS HAVE NO GRACE AND MAY THE SOJOURN OF THE NAZARENES BE FOR THEM NO ABIDING PLACE SO THEY CARRIED FUEL TO THE JAWS OF THE CAVERN AND SET FIRE TO IT
THEREUPON SHE TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND LED ME UNABLE TO RESIST FOR THE VIOLENCE OF HER PRESSURE THROUGH SEVEN VESTIBULES WHILST THE OLD WOMAN FOREWENT US WITH THE LIGHTED CANDLE TILL WE CAME TO A GREAT SALOON WITH FOUR ESTRADES WHEREON A HORSEMAN MIGHT PLAY POLO.[FN#530 HERE SHE RELEASED ME SAYING OPEN THINE EYES SO I OPENED THEM STILL GIDDY FOR THE EXCESS OF HER EMBRACING AND PRESSING AND SAW THAT THE WHOLE SALOON WAS BUILT OF THE FINEST MARBLES AND ALABASTERS AND ALL ITS FURNITURE WAS OF SILK AND BROCADE EVEN TO THE CUSHIONS AND MATTRESSES

FN#234 ABA OR ABAYAH VULG
WHEN SHARRKAN SAW THIS THE CASE WAS GRIEVOUS TO HIM AND HE ASKED HIS COMRADES WHAT SHALL WE DO

BUT I SEE NOT THE CASE SAVE THE CONTRARY THEREOF AND THAT YOU ARE VICTORIOUS THEY QUESTIONED HIM AND HOW DID THE HOLY MAN REACH YOU
THE DAY WAS NOW DAZZLING BRIGHT AND THE FIRMAMENT SHONE WITH LIGHT AND THE FOLK HAD BEGUN TO CIRCULATE
I REFUSED IT BUT SHE SAID TO ME DID I NOT TELL THEE THAT THOU MUST DO MY BIDDING

AND THAT KNIGHT HAD LIMBS OF MIGHT AND HE WAS CLAD IN AN IRON CUIRASS MADE FOR STRESS OF FIGHT
SO WHEN SHE MADE HER APPEARANCE THE TROOPS SURROUNDED HER THESE OF THE RIGHT WING AND THOSE OF THE LEFT AND THE LITTER CEASED NOT ADVANCING WITH HER TILL SHE APPROACHED THE PALACE

AND DRAWING THE SIGN OF THE CROSS ON THEIR BROWS INCENSED THEM WITH THE INCENSE WHICH AS AFORESAID WAS THE SKITE OF THE CHIEF PATRIARCH THE COHEN THE HERESIARCH
FN#363 THERE IS NOTHING OF THIS IN THE KORAN
AS HE DIED IN A

TURKOMAN=TURK LIKE
ALLAH BLESS NOT THE DAYS WHICH HAVE LAID ME LOW I THE WORLD WITH DISGRACE AFTER SO MUCH GRACE
WHEN I KNEW THIS THE WIDE WORLD NARROWED ON ME O MY SON
ACCORDING TO POCOCK NOTAE SPEC
WE SHOULD DO BETTER TO THROW THE CHEST OVER THE GATEWAY
AND THIS REDE COMMENDETH ITSELF TO ME ON TWO COUNTS
AND FOR LONG JOURNEYS LBS

LAUGHED SHE TO STONE THOU MOANEST USELESS MOAN QUOTH I AN BE OF HARDEST STONE THY HEART ALLAH DREW SWEETEST SPRING FROM HARDEST STONE WHEN SHE SAW ME SHE LAUGHED AND SAID HOW IS IT THAT THOU ART AWAKE AND THAT SLEEP OVERCAME THEE NOT
THEREAT HE SWOONED AWAY AND ALL THE TROOPS CROWDED AROUND HIM WEEPING AND CRYING OUT AND SO REMAINED FOR A WHILE TILL HE CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE LOOKED AT SHARRKAN AND WEPT WITH SORE WEEPING WHILE THE WAZIR AND RUSTAM AND BAHRAM DID THE LIKE
FN#29 O PILGRIM YA HAJJ IS A POLITE ADDRESS EVEN TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT PILGRIMAGED
FOR WHEN OUR COMRADES HAD TAKEN THE TREASURE FROM THE HERMITAGE OF MATRUHINA AND DESIGNED TO WIN THEIR WAY CONSTANTINOPLE WARDS THEREUPON CAME OUT ON THEM A DRIVING HOST AND A DREADFUL OF THE INFIDELS AND THE DAMNED WITCH REPEATED TO THEM THE STORY TO FILL THEM WITH TROUBLE AND TERROR ADDING THE MOST OF THEM ARE DEAD AND THERE ARE BUT FIVE AND TWENTY MEN LEFT SAID BAHRAM O HOLY MAN
BUT AS REGARDS KUT AL-KULUB WHEN THE CALIPH WAS ANGERED AGAINST HER AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
AND WHEN HE SAW THEM THE TEARS STREAMED FROM HIS EYES AND HE WEPT AND SIGHED AND LAMENTED
HERE HE SAT HIM DOWN ON THE BANKS OF A RIVER AND SUMMONING ONE OF HIS CONFIDANTS BADE HIM WEND HIS WAY TO KING ZAHR SHAH AND ANNOUNCE HIS APPROACH WITHOUT DELAY
SO WHEN SLUMBER OVERPOWERED HIM HE SLEPT AND THE STEED CEASED NOT GOING ON WITH HIM TILL HALF THE NIGHT WAS SPENT AND ENTERED ONE OF THE THICKETS[FN#160 WHICH WAS DENSE WITH GROWTH
INDEED I MUST RETURN AND SEE HOW SHE DOES SO HE GAVE HIM LEAVE WHEREUPON ANOTHER ROSE AND SAID O MY LORD NUR AL-DIN I WISH NOW TO GO TO MY BROTHER'S FOR HE CIRCUMCISETH HIS SON TO DAY."[FN#26 IN SHORT EACH AND EVERY ASKED PERMISSION TO RETIRE ON SOME PRETENCE OR OTHER TILL ALL THE TEN WERE GONE LEAVING NUR AL-DIN ALONE
WHEN THE KING HEARD OF THIS HE JOYED WITH EXCEEDING JOY AND REWARDED THE BEARER OF THE GOOD TIDINGS WITH MUCH TREASURE
CONSULT THEM NOT IN AUGHT;[FN#264 BUT GRUDGE NOT COMPLAISANCE TO THEM LEST THEY GREED FOR INTRIGUE AND EKE QUOTH HE WHOSO LEAVETH THE PATH OF MODERATION HIS WITS BECOME PERPLEXED
AND I DESIGNED TO BUY HER FOR OUR LORD THE SULTAN
THIS MIGHTY MONARCH HAD A SON YCLEPT SHARRKAN,[FN#143 WHO WAS LIKEST OF ALL MEN TO HIS FATHER AND WHO PROVED HIMSELF ONE OF THE PRODIGIES OF HIS TIME FOR SUBDUING THE BRAVE AND BRINGING HIS CONTEMPORARIES TO BANE AND BAN
AND COLLECTING ROUND HIM TEN OF THE SONS OF THE MERCHANTS BEGAN TO EAT MEAT AND DRINK WINE GIVING ENTERTAINMENT AFTER ENTERTAINMENT AND LAVISHING HIS PRESENTS AND HIS FAVOURS
IT IS NOT A DICTIONARY WORD BUT THE ONLY TERM IN POPULAR USE FOR EUROPEAN BROADCLOTH
SO ZAU AL-MAKAN AND HIS BROTHER BROUGHT THEM TO A PRIVATE PLACE WHERE THEY LAID BARE TO BOTH OF THEM THE STORY OF THE DEVOTEE AND WEPT TILL THEY MADE THE TWO KINGS WEEP.--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY

MY DEAR SIR ALLOW ME THUS PUBLICLY TO EXPRESS MY ADMIRATION OF YOUR MAGNUM OPUS THE BOOK OF THE THOUSAND NIGHTS AND ONE NIGHT AND TO OFFER YOU MY CORDIAL THANKS FOR HONOURING ME WITH THE DEDICATION OF THAT SCHOLAR-LIKE AND ADMIRABLE VERSION
AND SHE VERSIFIED WITH THESE COUPLETS BLOWS FROM MY LOVER'S LAND A ZEPHYR COOLY SWEET AND WITH ITS EVERY BREATH MAKES OLDEN LOVE NEW GLOW
AND WHEN HE SAW THEM HE WAS CONFOUNDED AND LAUGHED[FN#98 AND SAID TO THEM HOW IS IT WITH ALL OF YOU AND WHAT BEFEL YOU IN THE HOUSE AND WHAT HATH COME TO PASS TO YOU WHEN THEY SAW HIM THEY EXCLAIMED PRAISE BE TO ALLAH FOR THY PRESERVATION AND THREW THEMSELVES UPON HIM AND HIS CHILDREN HUNG ABOUT HIM CRYING SLACK OUR FATHER
WHEN THE MERCHANT HEARD WHAT SHE SAID HIS FANCY TOOK WINGS FOR DELIGHT IN HER AND TURNING TO THE BADAWI HE ASKED HIM WHAT IS HER PRICE FOR INDEED SHE IS NOBLE THEREUPON THE BADAWI WAXED ANGRY AND ANSWERED THOU WILT TURN ME THE GIRL'S HEAD WITH THIS TALK

CONTENTS OF THE SECOND VOLUME 7
BUT BUT STILL NAUGHT SAVE WHAT'S FAIR CAN COME FROM FAIREST FLOW'R
THE CITY WAS FULL OF MEN MOURNING AND THE KEEPERS WERE KEENING AND SIGHS AND CRIES WERE HEARD FROM ALL SIDES
AND BREASTS LIKE DOUBLE POMEGRANATES
DRUMS WERE BEATEN AND SPEARS WERE BRANDISHED AND HORNS BLARED AND FLAGS FLUTTERED AND STEEDS PRANCED FOR PRECEDENCE AND SCENTS SHED FRAGRANCE TILL THEY REACHED THE PALACE GATE AND THE PAGES ENTERED WITH THE LITTER THROUGH THE HARIM WICKET
AND SUCH IS THE MANNER OF THE DEATH OF SULTAN OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN NOW WHEN THE WAZIR DANDAN HAD MADE AN END OF HIS STORY ZAU AL MAKAN AND HIS SISTER NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN WEPT
SHARRKAN MARVELLED AT THE ART AND ARTIFICE OF THE PLACE AND BEGAN RECITING HE PLUCKS FRUITS OF HER NECKLACE IN RIVALRY AND HER BREAST PEARLS THAT BEDDED IN GOLD MINE LIE
A HARSH ROUGH EPIDERMIS SPOILS SPORT WITH THE HANDSOMEST WOMAN
AND THERE BEFEL A GREAT FIGHT BUT ALLAH ASSIGNED VICTORY TO THE FAITHFUL AND DEFEAT TO THE FAITHLESS
AND WHEN ALMIGHTY ALLAH MADE MORNING DAWN SHARRKAN AND HIS COMPANY AND ABRIZAH AND HER COMPANY TOOK HORSE AND FARED ON TOWARDS THE CITY
FN#264 THE AUSTERE CALIPH OMAR WHOSE SCOURGE WAS MORE FEARED THAN THE SWORD WAS THE
NOR DRINK WITHOUT MUSIC FOR OFT I'VE SEEN THE HORSE DRINK BEST TO THE WHISTLE'S SOUND WHEN THE CALIPH SAW THIS THE VEIN OF WRATH STARTED UP BETWEEN HIS EYES AND HE CAME DOWN AND SAID TO THE WAZIR O JA'AFAR NEVER BEHELD I YET MEN OF PIETY IN SUCH CASE
STUNDE A MEASURE OF TIME RATHER THAN DISTANCE IS AN HOUR'S TRAVEL OR ITS EQUIVALENT A LEAGUE A MEILE=THREE ENGLISH STAT
BUT AS REGARDS HIS FATHER OMAR BIN AL NU'UMAN SOON AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF HIS SON THE CHILDREN'S TUTORS AND GOVERNORS PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM AND SAID TO HIM O OUR LORD THY CHILDREN HAVE NOW LEARNT KNOWLEDGE AND THEY ARE COMPLETELY VERSED IN THE RULES OF MANNERS AND THE ETIQUETTE OF CEREMONY THE KING REJOICED THEREAT WITH EXCEEDING JOY AND CONFERRED BOUNTIFUL LARGESSE UPON THE LEARNED MEN SEEING ZAU AL MAKAN GROWN UP AND FLOURISHING AND SKILLED IN HORSEMANSHIP
AND THE WAZIR KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE HIM AND ANSWERED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND LASTLY HE CHARGED SHARRKAN THAT HE SHOULD CONSULT THE WAZIR ON ALL OCCASIONS WHICH HE PROMISED TO DO
SO DO THOU MOUNT THIS TREE AND LOOK UPON THEM LEST THE BLESSINGS OF THE BLEST BE LOST TO THEE JA'AFAR HEARING THE WORDS OF THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL AND BEING CONFOUNDED BY THEM CLIMBED TO THE TREE TOP AND LOOKING IN SAW NUR AL-DIN AND THE DAMSEL AND SHAYKH IBRAHIM HOLDING IN HIS HAND A BRIMMING BOWL
THEY PRAYED FOR ME A PRAYER THAT NO PROSTRATION KNOWS;[FN#23 THEY PRAYED FOR ME WHO PRAISED ME AND WERE MY FRIENDS OF YORE
SO MUCH FOR THE CAUSE OF THEIR COMING
TOO WELL KNOWN TO REQUIRE DESCRIPTION
QUOTH A CERTAIN HOLY MAN I CONGRATULATE MYSELF IN DEATH THOUGH I AM NOT ASSURED OF REST THEREIN SAVE THAT I KNOW DEATH INTERVENETH BETWEEN A MAN AND HIS WORKS
ALBEIT HER AFFECTION FORBADE HER TO ACQUAINT ME WITH WHAT SHE SUFFERED OF PASSION AND PINING WHEN SHE SAW THE EXCESS OF MY LONGING AND DISTRACTION
AND THEY STINTED NOT TO CHARGE AND TO SMITE RIGHT HAND MEETING RIGHT NOR TO HACK AND HEW WITH BLADES BRIGHT WHITE TILL DAY TURNED TO NIGHT AND GLOOM OPPRESSED THE SIGHT
BETTER A WEAL-BRINGING LIE THAN A HARM-DEALING TRUTH
AND HE ABODE WITH THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL ENJOYING THE PLEASANTEST OF LIVES TILL DEATH OVERTOOK HIM
344 AT MECCAH I ALSO HEARD OF TWO PLACES CALLED AL-UMRAH THE GREATER IN THE WADY FATIMAH AND THE LESSER HALF WAY NEARER THE CITY IBID
FOR THOU ART YOUNG IN LIFE AND A RAW LADDIE
AND WHEN NIGHT CAME ON GHANIM BIN AYYUB THE DISTRAUGHT THE THRALL O LOVE ROSE AND LIT THE WAX CANDLES AND LAMPS TILL THE PLACE BLAZED WITH LIGHT;[FN#107 AFTER WHICH HE PRODUCED THE WINE SERVICE AND SPREAD THE TABLE
SO MAKING SURE OF ATTAINING MY DESIRE AND BEING FAMISHED FOR FOOD I WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND RAISED THE COVER AND FOUND IN THE MIDDLE A CHINA DISH CONTAINING FOUR CHICKENS REDDENED WITH ROASTING AND SEASONED WITH SPICES ROUND THE WHICH WERE FOUR SAUCERS ONE CONTAINING SWEETMEATS ANOTHER CONSERVE OF POMEGRANATE SEEDS A THIRD ALMOND PASTRY[FN#502 AND A FOURTH HONEY FRITTERS
SO THEY THRONGED ROUND HIM TO KISS HIS HANDS AND HE CRIED OUT O PEOPLE OF THE BEST OF MANKIND,[FN#442 THE LAMP WHICH SHINETH IN DARKNESS BLIND VERILY THE INFIDELS HAVE OUTWITTED THE MOSLEMS BY GUILE FOR THEY FELL UPON THE HOST OF THE ONE GOD WHILST THEY DEEMED THEMSELVES SAFE FROM THE FAITHLESS AND ATTACKED THEM IN THEIR TENTS AND MADE A SORE SLAUGHTER OF THEM WHAT WHILE THEY LOOKED FOR NO WILE
AH
HAVE YE NOT HEARD THE SAYING OF THE POET NEEDS MUST I BEAR THE TERM BY FATE DECREED AND WHEN THAT DAY BE DEAD NEEDS MUST I DIE
FOR THEY REJOICE IN LEAVING BEHIND THEM CHILDREN AND SUCCESSORS WHEREBY ARE DOUBLED THEIR NUMBER AND THEIR STRENGTH
SO THEY RUSHED UPON THEIR ENEMIES AND DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO ALLAH IN THEIR FIGHT FOR THE FAITH
WHEN THOU RETURNEST TO THY MOTHER LEARN WHAT THING SHE KEEPETH FOR THEE I REJOINED MY MOTHER ALSO SAID TO ME
THEN MOUNTING WITH HIS MAMELUKES RODE FORWARD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DUST CLOUD
SHAMBAR IS THE ARAB
VERILY THINE ACTS ARE THOSE OF A COUNSELLOR RIGHT DEAR AND JUDGEMENT AND FORESEEING CLEAR ARE IN THE HANDS OF THE SUBTLE OF LERE THEN BADE HE THE CHAMBERLAIN FORTHWITH GO OUT AND CAUSE THE TABLES TO BE SPREAD AND ORDER ALL THE TROOPS THERETO
WITNESS THE OFT QUOTED TALE OF HATIM AND HIS HORSE
SO HAPLY HE WILL HELP US CONQUER CONSTANTINOPLE ACCORDINGLY THEY CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN WHILE ZAT AL-DAWAHI WAS IMPOTENT TO OPPOSE THEIR MARCH FOR FEAR OF BETRAYING HER DECEIT
THE SCOTCH CURCH OR COIF OPPOSED TO THE MAIDEN SNOOD AND LASTLY OUR SERGEANT-AT-LAW'S COIF
AND THE DAMSEL HAD TUCKED UP THE END OF HER GOWN UNDER HER ARM PIT AND HAD ROLLED UP HER SLEEVES TO THE ELBOW SO THAT I COULD SEE HER WHITE WRISTS WHEREON WERE TWO PAIRS OF BRACELETS WITH CLASPS OF GREAT PEARLS
AND THINK OF DEATH AND DOOM ERE IT ARISETH
COMPARE BOCCACOO IV
NOW ALLAH THE DECREER WHO DECREETH ALL THINGS AND WHO FOR EVERY EFFECT APPOINTETH A CAUSE HAD SO DISPOSED THAT THE CALIPH WAS AT THAT MOMENT SITTING IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF HIS PALACE OVERLOOKING THE TIGRIS
THEN SAID THE EUNUCH TO ZAU AL-MAKAN PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY LORD AND ON THEE BE PEACE REPLIED ZAU AL-MAKAN AND THE MERCY OF ALLAH AND HIS BLESSINGS O MY LORD CONTINUED THE EUNUCH---AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE SEVENTY-FOURTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE EUNUCH SAID TO ZAU AL-MAKAN O MY LORD I HAVE SOUGHT THEE THESE SEVERAL TIMES THIS NIGHT FOR MY MISTRESS BIDDETH THEE TO HER QUOTH ZAU AL MAKAN AND WHO BE THIS BITCH THAT SEEKETH FOR ME
THE RACES OF HINDOSTAN TERM THE ENGLISH NOT WHITE MEN BUT RED MEN AND THE REASON WILL AT ONCE BE SEEN BY COMPARING A BRITISHER WITH A HIGH-CASTE NAGAR BRAHMAN WHOSE FACE IS OF PARCHMENT COLOUR AS IF HE HAD DRUNK EXSANGUE CUMINUM
SOME PASSER BY SOME WAYFARER MUST HAVE RECITED THE VERSES AND DISTURBED ME AND KEPT ME AWAKE
AVOIR
AND THE DUST COLUMNS ROSE AND THE DAY WANED AND THE SUN WAXED YELLOW AND WAN
FN#527 A PLAY UPON SAK = CALF OR LEG AND SAKI A CUP BEARER
WHEN THE ANGRY CURMUDGEON MADE READY FOR BLOWS AND THE FIRE OF A FIGHT KINDLED HE AND HIS BAND I SMOTE HIM IN FURY WITH RIGHT AND WITH LEFT AND HIS HIDE TILL WELL SATISFIED CURRIED AND TANNED
THEN HE LOST HIS SENSES
FN#427 I.E WHERE THE SYRIANS FOUND HIM
AND THE KING SAID TO HIM I DESIRE THOU GO OUT AGAINST SHARRKAN KING OF DAMASCUS SON OF OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN AND DELIVER US FROM THIS AFFLICTION QUOTH LUKA HEARKENING AND OBEDIENCE AND THE KING MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS ON HIS FOREHEAD AND FELT ASSURED OF HELP FROM HEAVEN BEING NEAR HAND
AND IF THE KING RESTRAIN NOT HIS FOLK FROM ONE ANOTHER THE STRONG WILL DRIVE THE WEAK TO THE WALL
AND WHEN THEY WERE GATHERED TOGETHER THEY SOUGHT THE DEVOTEE BUT COULD FIND NO TRACE OF HIM
SO POSSESS THY SOUL IN PATIENCE AND WAIT
WHEN IT WAS THE FIFTY-SIXTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE BADAWI GAVE THE BARLEY SCONE TO NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN AND PROMISED HE WOULD SELL HER TO A GOOD MAN LIKE HIMSELF SHE REPLIED WHATSO THOU DOEST IS RIGHT AND ABOUT MIDNIGHT WHEN HUNGER BURNED HER,[FN#244 SHE ATE A VERY LITTLE OF THAT BARLEY BREAD AND THE BADAWI ORDERED HIS PARTY TO SET OUT
BUT AN YOU YIELD YOURSELVES WE WILL TAKE YOU TO OUR KING WHO WILL MAKE PEACE WITH YOU ON CONDITION THAT YOU QUIT OUR COUNTRY AND RETURN HOME AND HARM US IN NAUGHT AND WE WILL DO YOU NO HARM IN AUGHT
WHEN IT WAS THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRD NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN KING ZAU AL-MAKAN SAW THAT THE ACCURSED INFIDEL HAD STRUCK WITH JAVELIN HIS BROTHER SHARRKAN HE DEEMED HIM DEAD AND DESPATCHED CAVALIERS TOWARDS HIM
IN ANY CASE THIS PERSON IS HANDSOME OF FACE AND MAKETH ME HOPE FOR BETTER TREATMENT FROM HIM THAN FROM MY BRUTE OF A BADAWI
THEN THEY FELL TO FOINING AND HEWING AND THEY STINTED NOT OF ONSET AND OFFSET AND GIVE AND TAKE AS THEY WERE TWO MOUNTAINS CLASHING TOGETHER OR TWO SEAS TOGETHER DASHING
BUT HE DRIED NOT HIS TEARS GRIEVING FOR HIS BROTHER TILL HIS BODY WAS WASTED AND SICK GROWING THIN AS A TOOTH PICK
KORANIC VERSETS AS OPPOSED TO CHAPTERS
NAY SHE REPLIED WITH LOVE AND GLADNESS EKE I WIS
FOR IF THIS MATTER BE NOISED AMONG THE FOLK HAPLY IT MAY COME TO THE EARS OF SOME,[FN#420 AND THIS WILL BE THE CAUSE OF OUR RUIN AND OF THE RUIN OF ALL MOSLEMS WHO RESORT TO THE LAND OF THE GREEKS NOW THEY HAD HIDDEN THE CHEST WHEREIN WAS THE DAMNED ZAT AL DAWAHI
IT CHANCED ONE DAY THAT A KNIGHT CALLED DAKIANUS[FN#428 CAME TO THE HERMITAGE ACCOMPANIED BY TEN SQUIRES AND HIS DAUGHTER TAMASIL A GIRL WHOSE BEAUTY WAS INCOM PARABLE
MEANWHILE THE FIREMAN'S WIFE HAD KILLED AND COOKED TWO CHICKENS
WHEN THEY SAW HIM AND KNEW HIM THEY DISMOUNTED AND SALUTING HIM ASKED THE REASON OF HIS ABSENCE
THEN HE WENT UP TO ANIS AL-JALIS AND THREW HIS ARMS ROUND HER AND WE KNOW NOT WHAT HE DID AFTER THAT
171-175 ETC WHERE I DESCRIBED THE WATER AS OF SALT-BITTER TASTE LIKE THAT OF EPSOM III
AND THE EMIRS AND WAZIRS AND GRANDEES MARCHED PAST BEFORE KING SHARRKAN WHILST THE SINGERS AND THE TIRE WOMEN TOOK THE DAMSEL TO DRESS AND ADORN HER BUT FOUND SHE NEEDED NO ADORNMENT
THEN HE KISSED PRINCESS ABRIZAH'S HAND AND SAID PRAISE BE TO ALLAH WHO HATH BESTOWED THEE ON ME AND APPOINTED THEE TO BE THE CAUSE OF MY SALVATION AND THE SALVATION OF WHOSO IS WITH ME
MUCH FOLK ALSO WERE SLAIN WHILE GOING IN AT THE GATES FOR THE FLOCK WAS GREAT
FN#201 ARAB
AND HE BORE IN BALDRICK A BLADE OF WATERED INDIAN STEEL THAT THROUGH NECKS SHORE AND MADE EASY THE HARD AND SORE
SO BRING ME SOPHIA ACCORDINGLY HE SUMMONED HER AND SHE CAME FORTHRIGHT AND HE DELIVERED HER TO THE OLD WOMAN WHO MIXED HER UP WITH THE OTHER DAMSELS
AND AL-MU'IN THOUGH THE AFFAIR CAME TO HIS EARS DARED NOT DIVULGE IT BY REASON OF THE HIGH FAVOUR IN WHICH HIS RIVAL STOOD WITH THE SULTAN
IT IS SAID THAT HE LAUGHED ONCE AND WEPT ONCE
LONDON TRUBNER 1883
KNOW THEN O KING THAT ALL MEN'S WORKS TEND EITHER TO RELIGIOUS OR TO LAICAL LIFE FOR NONE ATTAINETH TO RELIGION SAVE THROUGH THIS WORLD BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST ROAD TO FUTURITY
SO SHE SAT DOWN AND HE SAT BY HER AND HE BEGAN TO TALK WITH HER OF WINE AND WASSAIL WHEREUPON SHE FURNISHED THE CAROUSING TABLE[FN#219 AND PLACED IT BEFORE HIM
BEHOLD HER HUSBAND ENTERED AND SEEING HER FEEDING HIM SAT DOWN AT HIS HEAD AND SAID TO HIM HOW IS IT WITH THEE NOW O MY SON THANKS BE TO ALLAH FOR RECOVERY HE REPLIED
THE SO-CALLED MAUNDEVILLE OR MANDEVILLE IN A
TA'AM WHICH HAS MANY MEANINGS
GREEK LETTERS CHRISTIANS AND JEWS WERE COMPELLED BY THE FANATICAL SUMPTUARY LAWS OF THE CALIPH AL-MUTAWAKKIL AD
THEN SHE DISAPPEARED WITHIN AND RETURNED WITH A MIRROR A BAG
BUT AFTER WE HAD TARRIED IN CONSTANTINOPLE FOR SOME TIME HAVING SOLD OUR GOODS AND BOUGHT OTHERS IN THEIR STEAD WE DETERMINED ON AND MADE READY FOR A RETURN TO OUR NATIVE LAND
FN#194 JAMIL BIN MA'AMAR A POET AND LOVER CONTEMPORARY WITH AL-KUTHAYRIR
THEN HE SAID TO AL-AHNAF O SON OF THE SEA DRAW NEAR AND TELL ME WHAT COUNSEL THOU HAST FOR ME QUOTH AL-AHNAF PART THY HAIR AND TRIM THY MOUSTACHIO AND PARE THY NAILS AND PLUCK THINE ARMPITS AND SHAVE THY PUBES[FN#268 AND EVER USE THE TOOTHSTICK BECAUSE THEREIN BE TWO AND SEVENTY VIRTUES AND MAKE THE GHUSL OR COMPLETE ABLUTION ON FRIDAY AS AN EXPIATION FOR ALL BETWEEN THE FRIDAYS.'--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
THE SECOND WAS THE SEAL OF TRIBUTE AND OF THE RECEIPT OF MONIES AND ON IT WAS WRITTEN BUILDING UP
AND IF THE THING GET WIND I WILL DECLARE THAT I DIVORCED HER BEFORE CONSUMMATION AND MARRIED HER TO MY CHIEF CHAMBERLAIN THEN HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND SIGHING SAID O NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN THOU ART MY VERY SISTER AND I CRY
IF YE ENTREAT ME FAIR I WILL TARRY WITH YOU AND IF YE DEAL EVILLY BY ME I WILL DEPART FROM YOU THEN SHE BADE HER SLAVE MAIDENS BRING FOOD
SHE OPENED THE CASKET AND TAKING OUT THOSE THREE JEWELS KISSED THEM AND GAVE THEM TO THE KING
BUT AS REGARDS KING AFRIDUN LORD OF CONSTANTINOPLE AND SOVRAN OF ROUM AND ZAT AL-DAWAHI THEY ASSEMBLED THE EMIRS OF THE HOST AND SAID TO THEM VERILY WE HAD WORKED OUR WILL AND SOLACED OUR HEARTS BUT OUR OVER CONFIDENCE IN OUR NUMBERS AND THAT ONLY DEFEATED US THEN QUOTH TO THEM THE ANCIENT ONE THE LADY OF CALAMITIES IN VERY SOOTH NOUGHT SHALL PROFIT YOU EXCEPT YE DRAW YOU NIGH UNTO THE MESSIAH AND PUT YOUR TRUST IN THE TRUE BELIEF FOR BY THE VIRTUE OF THE MESSIAH THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF THE MOSLEM HOST LIETH IN THAT SATAN KING SHARRKAN TOMORROW SAID KING AFRIDUN I HAVE RESOLVED TO DRAW UP IN BATTLE ARRAY AND TO SEND OUT AGAINST THEM THAT REDOUBTABLE CAVALIER LUKA BIN SHAMLUT
A BAR A PARTITION
WHEN IT WAS THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIRST NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SHARRKAN CONGRATULATED HIS BROTHER ZAU AL-MAKAN ON HIS SAFETY AND THANKED HIM FOR THE DEEDS HE HAD DONE
SO WHEN WE PONDERED THAT TRUTH WE KNEW THAT THIS LETTER WAS NONE OTHER THAN A GRIEVOUS CALAMITY
HIS MOST CELEBRATED SAYING WAS BE CONSTANT IN MEDITATION ON DEATH
SO FINE SO THIN DRAWN TIS TO READ UNSUITABLE QUOTH I FOR THAT I'M FINE-DRAWN WASTED WAXED THIN THUS LOVERS WRIT SHOULD BE FOR SO LOVE WILLS HIS WILL
AND LET THEM TALK WITH THEM OF ALL MANNER SCIENCE AND EDIFYING KNOWLEDGE
WHEN HE SAW THIS HE THANKED ZUBAYDAH FOR HER GOOD DEED AND ABODE PERPLEXED HALTING BETWEEN BELIEF AND UNBELIEF TILL AT LAST SUSPICION OVERCAME HIM AND HE GAVE ORDER TO OPEN THE GRAVE AND TAKE OUT THE BODY
THEN THE SULTAN BADE PROCLAIM ABOUT THE CITY OYEZ O YE LIEGES ONE AND ALL
FN#16 IN THE OLD VERSION SHE IS CALLED THE FAIR PERSIAN PROBABLY FROM THE OWNER
WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE HER I REPEATED TO HER THOSE TWO COUPLETS OF MY COUSIN'S
BUT NOW I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE BETWEEN THIS PLACE AND BAGHDAD AND WHAT BETIDETH THY COMRADE SHALL BETIDE THEE QUOTH THE FIREMAN WHAT I FEARED HATH BEFALLEN ME AND HE REPEATED THIS COUPLET TWAS AS I FEARED THE COMING ILLS DISCERNING
MEANWHILE EACH OF US SHALL TELL HOW HE CAME TO BE CASTRATED AND ALL THAT BEFEL HIM FROM FIRST TO LAST THE BETTER TO PASS AWAY OUR TIME WHILE WE TAKE OUR REST THEREUPON THE FIRST HE OF THE LANTHORN AND WHOSE NAME WAS BUKHAYT SAID I'LL TELL YOU MY TALE SAY ON REPLIED THEY
WHEN IT WAS THE EIGHTY-FIRST NIGHT SHE CONTINUED IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE WAZIR DANDAN SAID TO ZAU AL-MAKAN THUS SPAKE THE SECOND HAND MAID TO THE KING WHO HATH FOUND MERCY OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN
ZUHAL
SO GO THOU TO THY HOST AND TURN THEM BACK ERE THEY BE LED DEEP INTO AND SHUT IN BY THE LAND OF THE BEVY OF DAMSELS IN THE SHIP AND SETTING FORTH THE FRANKS AND THE COUNTRY OF THE GREEKS
I CAN COMPARE IT WITH NOTHING BUT A LONG NIGHTGOWN DYED A DIRTY YELLOW BY SAFFLOWER AND ABOUT AS PICTURESQUE AS A CARTER'S SMOCK-FROCK
AND LAYL A NIGHT IS OFTEN USED TO DENOTE THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS BETWEEN SUNSET AND SUNSET WHILST YAUM A DAY WOULD BY US BE TRANSLATED IN MANY CASES BATTLE-DAY FN#438 ITERUM THE HIMALAYAN BROTHERS FN#439 AGAIN MOHAMMED WHO PROMISED GOOD TO THE GOOD AND VICE VERSA
AND SHE ANSWERED I DESIRED TO PROVE THY PROWESS AFIELD AND TEST THY DOUGHTINESS IN TILTING AND JOUSTING
I SWEAR THE OATH OF LOVE'S OWN SLAVES WHO KNOW NO PERJURY
BUT SHE CAME NOT AND HE WATCHED FOR HER TILL THE MORNING MORROWED BUT STILL SHE RETURNED NOT
AND HOW ALLAH VOUCHSAFED TO SEND THE FIREMAN TO HIM AND HOW HE HAD JOURNEYED WITH HIM AND SPENT HIS MONEY ON HIM AND HAD SERVED HIM NIGHT AND DAY
AND HE SAITH THIS IS BUT A HALF LIE
FOR THE SHADOW OF A SAINT CAN COVER ONLY TWAIN SHARRKAN SAID AS FOR ME I WILL NOT LEAVE MY COMRADES
AND MY FATHER FOUND NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO WRITE AN ANSWER TO KING AFRIDUN MAKING HIS EXCUSES AND SWEARING TO HIM BY STRONG OATHS THAT HE KNEW NOT HIS DAUGHTER TO BE AMONG THE BEVY OF DAMSELS IN THE SHIP AND SETTING FORTH HOW HE HAD SENT HER TO KING OMAR BIN AL NU'UMAN WHO HAD GOTTEN THE BLESSING OF ISSUE BY HER
AND ON NEW YEAR'S DAY I WENT TO THE BATH WHERE I REFRESHED MYSELF AND PUT ON A SUIT OF SUMPTUOUS CLOTHES
TOMORROW REPAIR TO HER AT THE OLD PLACE AND SEE WHAT SIGN SHE MAKETH TO THEE
LET THY HOUSE SPEAK THY DEATH BY ITS BUILDER FORSAKEN
FN#221 AMONGST MOSLEMS THIS IS A REFERENCE TO ADAM WHO FIRST SINNED AGAINST HIMSELF AND WHO THEREFORE IS CALLED SAFIYU'LLAH THE PURE OF ALLAH
THEN SHOULD IT BE AS THOU KNOWEST,[FN#271 I THROW HER ON HER BACK
SO NOW TELL ME HOW IT HATH FARED WITH THEE SINCE I LEFT THEE THEREUPON HE TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END
WHEN IT WAS THE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEENTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE YOUNG MERCHANT CONTINUED HIS RECITAL TO TAJ AL MULUK
NOW THEY HAD TRAVERSED GREAT DESERTS AND DRINK HAD BEEN SIX DAYS CUT OFF FROM THEM WHEN THEY DREW NEAR THIS MEADOW AND SAW THEREIN WATERS FOUNTING AND RIPE FRUITS DAUNTING AND THAT LAND AS IT WERE PARADISE
NAWAYAH WHICH ALSO MEANS DISTANCE ABSENCE SEVERANCE
DOOMED US DESPITE OUR WILL TO BEAR THE HANDS OF BASE BORES CARK AND CARE WHEN HE ENDED HIS VERSE HE CRIED OUT AND FELL DOWN IN A FAINTING FIT
MIND AND GAZER WERE CONFOUNDED BY ITS BEAUTY EVEN AS SAITH THE POET BEHOLD THIS LOVELY GARDEN
SHE WAS CLAD IN BROCADES BEFITTING KINGS
SO THEY RAISED THEM AND GATHERED TOGETHER SUCH OF THE MEN AT ARMS AS COULD REPEAT THE KORAN
THEY DID AS HE BADE THEM AND MOREOVER HE GAVE THEM LEAVE TO DIVERT THEMSELVES AND ORDERED THAT NONE OF THE LORDS IN WAITING SHOULD ATTEND UPON THE KING FOR SERVICE DURING THE SPACE OF THREE DAYS
HER HOUSINGS WERE OF WHITE SILK COVERED BY A PRAYER-CARPET OF CASH MERE STUFF AND ON HER BACK SAT A SHAYKH AN OLD MAN OF COMELY PRESENCE AND REVEREND ASPECT GARBED IN A GOWN OF WHITE WOOL
THEN I LOOKED AT HER AND SAW ON HER HEAD TWO BANDAGES ONE ON ACCOUNT OF THE ACCIDENT TO HER FOREHEAD AND THE OTHER OVER HER EYE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE PAIN SHE ENDURED FOR STRESS OF WEEPING
FN#429 IN SUCH TALES THE WAZIR IS USUALLY THE SHARP-WITTED MAN CONTRASTING WITH THE DUMMY OR MASTER
IKH TILL THE CAMEL KNEELS
AND ALL THE PEOPLE FLOCKED FORTH TO TAKE LEAVE OF THEM AND ENTRUST THEM WITH THE MONIES AND THE MESSAGES
I WILL TAKE NO HEED OF THIS AND I CARE FOR NONE FOR I AM MINE OWN COUNTRY."[FN#313 QUOTH THE STOKER WHY WILT THOU OBEY THY FLESH AND THE DEVIL
FN#195 ARAB
AND FORTHRIGHT THEY AGREED UPON THIS MATTER AND THEY WENT FORTH
AND THE PLACE WAS CHOKED WITH THE SLAIN
FN#324 I HAVE DERIVED THIS WORD FROM THE PERSIAN RANG"=COLOUR HUE KIND
WHEREUPON KING HARDUB WENT IN TO KING AFRIDUN AND SAID TO HIM O KING WE HAVE NO NEED OF THE CHIEF PATRIARCH NOR OF HIS PRAYERS BUT WILL CONSULT MY MOTHER'S COUNSEL AND OBSERVE WHAT SHE WILL DO WITH HER CRAFT UNENDING AGAINST THE MOSLEM HOSTS
SO NEEDS MUST THOU KNOW HIM BY ALLAH REPLIED THE FIREMAN I TELL THEE THE TRUTH
AS SOON AS SHE SMELT THE BREEZE AND THE AIR ENTERED HER NOSTRILS MOUTH AND LUNGS SHE SNEEZED AND CHOKED AND COUGHED
BUT WHOSE UTTERS A WORD I WILL THROW HER AND TRUSS HER UP WITH HER OWN GIRDLE[FN#161 HE KEPT WALKING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUND AND WHEN HE REACHED THE FURTHER SIDE HE LOOKED AND BEHOLD A STREAM WAS GUSHING AND FLOWING AND ANTELOPES AT LARGE WERE FRISKING AND ROVING AND WILD CATTLE AMID THE PASTURE MOVING AND BIRDS EXPRESSED JOY AND GLADNESS IN THEIR DIVERS TONGUES AND THAT PLACE WAS PURFLED WITH ALL MANNER FLOWERS AND GREEN HERBS EVEN AS A POET DESCRIBED IT IN THESE COUPLETS MOST BEAUTIFUL IS EARTH IN BUDDING BLOOM WHEN LUCID WATERS COURSE THROUGH PLAIN AND WOOD
AS SOON AS DAY HAD DEPARTED OUR SIGHT AND NIGHT WAS COME TO DARKEN LIGHT WE REPAIRED TO THE CELL WHEREIN WAS THE DUNGEON AND WE HEARD THE HOLY MAN AFTER CHANTING SOME VERSES OF THE KORAN REPEAT THE FOLLOWING COUPLETS MY HEART DISHEARTENED IS MY BREAST IS STRAIT AND SINKS MY SOUL IN SEA OF BALE AND BATE UNLESS ESCAPE BE NEAR I SOON SHALL DIE
IN THE BASALTIC CITIES OF THE HAURAN WHERE THE DOORS ARE OF THICK STONE THEY MOVE EASILY ON THESE PINS
FN#45 WAYFARERS TRAVELLERS WHO HAVE A CLAIM ON THE KINDNESS OF THOSE AT HOME
NOW WHILST THEY WERE IN THE MIDST OF THEIR REJOICINGS BEHOLD THE RAVEN OF DULE AND DOWNFALL CROAKED OVER THEM AND UP CAME THE TWENTY FUGITIVE SHIPS WHEREIN WAS THE KING OF CAESAREA
AND IT IS NOW FOUR NIGHTS AND THIS BE THE FIFTH SINCE SHE IS GONE WHEN SHE HEARD THAT SHE SHRIEKED ALOUD AND WEPT AND SAID DID I NOT TELL THEE THAT THOU HAST SLAIN HER
AND THEY KNEW NOT THAT THIS HOLY PERSONAGE WAS LIKE HIM OF WHOM THE POET SAITH HE PRAYETH AND HE FASTETH FOR AN END HE DOTH ESPY
AND I CEASED NOT BRINGING TROUBLE UPON ALL WHEREVER I WAS SOLD AND WAS SHIFTED FROM LORD TO LORD AND FROM NOTABLE TO NOTABLE BEING SOLD AND BEING BOUGHT TILL I ENTERED THE PALACE OF THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL
SO HE ENTERED AND WOULD FAIN HAVE SLEPT BUT SLEEP CAME NOT TO HIM
BUT SHE LET DOWN HER VEIL OVER HER FACE SAYING HEAVEN FORBID O MY LORD!''[FN#253 THEN THE BADAWI WHO WAS SITTING AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WATCHING THEM SAW HER COVER HER FACE FROM THE MERCHANT WHILE ABOUT TO WIPE THE TEARS FROM HER CHEEKS
WOULD I NEAR HER OFF SHE FLIES AT TANGENT GRANTING LESS THE MORE I CLAIM
AND QUOTH HE SAY WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY IT PASSED THROUGH MY THOUGHT O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL SAID THE FISHERMAN THAT SINCE THOU WISHEST TO LEARN FISHING SO THOU MAYEST HAVE IN HAND AN HONEST TRADE WHEREBY TO GAIN THY LIVELIHOOD THIS MY GABERDINE BESITTETH THEE RIGHT WELL."[FN#57 THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL LAUGHED AT THIS SPEECH AND THE FISHERMAN WENT HIS WAY
IF MY PLOT WORK WELL NOT ONE OF THE MOSLEMS SHALL RETURN TO HIS OWN COUNTRY
THEREAT THE KING WAS GLAD AND THANKED HER AND KISSED HER HANDS
FN#33 HE GIVES HIM THE NAME OF HIS GRANDFATHER
AND THIS IS WHAT BEFEL ME FROM FIRST TO LAST
FN#107 AN EASTERN DISLIKES NOTHING MORE THAN DRINKING IN A DIM DINGY PLACE

BY ALLAH I CANNOT TELL HER PRICE FOR SHE HATH WON MY HEART WITH HER FAIR SPEECH AND GOOD LOOKS
NOW THE WAZIR AL-FAZL HAD A SON LIKE THE FULL MOON WHEN SHEENIEST DIGHT WITH FACE RADIANT IN LIGHT CHEEKS RUDDY BRIGHT AND A MOLE LIKE A DOT OF AMBERGRIS ON A DOWNY SITE
IS THIS HE WHO COMETH TO READ THE LETTER IT IS REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN
THIS WAS GRIEVOUS TO HIM AND HE SAID HOW COULD THE LADY LEAVE THE PALACE UNKNOWN OF ANY
WITHIN THE SECOND TEN DAYS OF THE MONTH THE OLD WOMAN RETURNED BRINGING SWEETMEATS WRAPPED IN A GREEN LEAF LIKE NO LEAF OF KNOWN TREE
SHIRK GIVING A PARTNER TO ALLAH ATTENDING CHIEFLY TO CHRISTIANS AND IDOLATERS AND IN A MINOR DEGREE TO JEWS AND GUEBRES
THUS FAR CONCERNING THE MOSLEM
AND BY THE TIME THEY HAD CEASED SPEAKING HE KNEW RIGHT WELL THAT THE TOMB WAS A FEINT AND A FRAUD AND THAT KUT AL-KULUB HAD BEEN IN GHANIM'S HOUSE FOR FOUR MONTHS
WHEREUPON HE CAME DOWN FROM THE DATE TREE AND SCOOPED AWAY THE EARTH WITH HIS HANDS TILL THE BOX WAS LAID BARE AND DISENGAGED FROM THE GROUND
O ALLAH I BESEECH THEE BY THY KNOWLEDGE OF HIDDEN THINGS THAT THOU MAKE THE SALVATION OF THIS YOUTH TO BE AT MY HANDS!"--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
AND IF E'ER ON OTHER REST THESE EYNE OF ME MAY YEARNING DRAW THEIR REINS NOR SUFFER SLEEP TO SEE AND WHEN THE MAN STINTED RECITING ZAU AL-MAKAN AND THE MINISTER DANDAN WEPT AND THE WHOLE ARMY WAS MOVED TO TEARS
WHEREUPON ANIS AL-JALIS GLANCED AT HIM AND SAID O SHAYKH IBRAHIM SEE HOW THIS HUSBAND OF MINE TREATETH ME AND HE ANSWERED O MY LADY WHAT AILETH HIM THIS IS HOW HE ALWAYS SERVETH ME CRIED SHE HE DRINKETH AWHILE THEN FALLETH ASLEEP AND LEAVETH ME ALONE WITH NONE TO BEAR ME COMPANY OVER MY CUP NOR ANY TO WHOM I MAY SING WHEN THE BOWL GOETH ROUND QUOTH THE SHAYKH AND HIS MIEN UNSTIFFENED FOR THAT HIS SOUL INCLINED TOWARDS HER BY ALLAH THIS IS NOT WELL THEN SHE CROWNED A CUP AND LOOKING TOWARDS HIM SAID BY MY LIFE THOU MUST TAKE AND DRINK IT AND NOT REFUSE TO HEAL MY SICK HEART SO HE PUT FORTH HIS HAND AND TOOK IT AND DRANK IT OFF AND SHE FILLED A SECOND AND SET IT ON THE CHANDELIER AND SAID O MASTER MINE THERE IS STILL THIS ONE LEFT FOR THEE BY ALLAH I CANNOT DRINK IT CRIED HE WHAT I HAVE ALREADY DRUNK IS ENOUGH FOR ME BUT SHE REJOINED BY ALLAH THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT SO HE TOOK THE CUP AND DRANK
GHANIM IS ANOTHER SOFTY LOVER A FAVOURITE CHARACTER IN ARAB TALES
NOW ABOUT THE SULTAN WAS A CHAMERLAIN ALAM[FN#38 AL-DIN SANJAR HIGHT WHO HAD AFORETIME BEEN MAMELUKE TO AL-FAZL
THE WAZIR OBEYED THE COMMANDS OF THE SULTAN WITH SUBMISSION AND WISHED HIM ETERNITY OF GLORY AND SAID THIS NEEDS MUST BE HE THEN REPAIRED TO THE HEART OF THE ENCAMPMENT AND ORDERED THE HOST TO HALT TEN DAYS
THE FOLK HASTENED TO HIM AND SEEING THE BLOOD STREAMING SET UP A CLAMOUR OF WEEPING AND WAILING
PERSICO-LATINUM A LARGE BANDY WITH BENT HEAD TO WHICH IS HUNG AN IRON BALL ALSO CALLED KAUKABAH OUR MORNING-STAR AND LIKE THE UMBRELLA IT DENOTES THE GRANDEES OF THE COURT
IT IS THE WILL OF OUR LORD THE SULTAN THAT WHOSO HAPPENETH ON NUR AL-DIN ALI SON OF AL FAZL BIN KHAKAN AND BRINGETH HIM TO THE SULTAN SHALL RECEIVE A ROBE OF HONOUR AND ONE THOUSAND GOLD PIECES
AND DIVIDED THE REST AMONG HIS DEPENDENTS
WHEN IT WAS THE SIXTY-NINTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SHARRKAN HEARD THESE WORDS HIS HEART FLUTTERED AND HIS COLOUR WAXED YELLOW AND HE WAS SEIZED WITH TREMBLING AND HE HUNG HIS HEAD EARTHWARDS FOR HE KNEW THAT SHE WAS HIS SISTER BY THE SAME FATHER
AND BADE SOME OF THE PAGES FETCH THE GOODS
IT IS HOWEVER EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING BEGINNING WITH BISMILLAH ETC AND ENDING BEFORE THE SIGNATURE WITH A QUOTATION FROM THE KORAN III
PRESENTLY HE TURNED TO THE GARDENER AND SAID TO HIM O SHAYKH IBRAHIM HAST THOU NO DRINK HERE FOR FOLK ARE WONT TO DRINK AFTER EATING THE SHAYKH BROUGHT HIM SWEET WATER COOL AND PLEASANT BUT HE SAID THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF DRINK I WANTED PERCHANCE THOU WISHEST FOR WINE INDEED I DO O SHAYKH I SEEK REFUGE FROM IT WITH ALLAH
ON MY VITALS COST THOU PREY AND DRIVE MY HEART BEFORE PLATONIC PASSION'S[FN#490 FORCE TO BOW
AND THE MINISTER WENT AWAY AFTER RECEIVING THE ROYAL CHARGE TO REPAIR TO THE SLAVE-BAZAR EVERY DAY AND ENTRUST TO BROKERS THE MATTER AFORESAID
AND SHE WEPT AS SHE HEARD MY WORDS AND SAID O SON OF MY UNCLE REJOICE AT THE GOOD TIDINGS OF THY DESIRE BEING FULFILLED AND THINE AIM BEING ATTAINED
AS SOON AS ZAT AL-DAWAHI HAD SLAIN SHARRKAN SHE HASTENED HER MARCH AND REACHED THE WALLS OF CONSTANTINOPLE WHERE SHE CALLED OUT IN THE GREEK TONGUE TO THE GUARDS TO THROW HER DOWN A ROPE
SO THEY ANNOUNCED THIS TO ALL PRESENT IN THE ROOM WHEREUPON THE KING'S MESSENGER CARRIED THE NEWS TO HIM
WHEN THE INFIDELS SAW THIS THEY CHARGED IN A BODY COMPACT AND UNITED UPON ZAU AL-MAKAN WHO MET THEM AMIDFIELD AND THEY ENGAGED IN HEWING AND FOINING TILL BLOOD RAN IN RILLS
A(LLAH B(LESS H(IM A(ND K(EEP)=ALLAH KEEP HIM AND ASSAIN
IT CORRESPONDS WITH THE BIBLICAL WALKING OR GOING SOFTLY
I CANNOT FORBEAR FROM THIS THEN HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS BAGHDAD AND THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND SHEDDING HER LIGHT ON THE PLACE AND NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN COULD NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT BUT WAS RESTLESS AND CALLED TO MIND HER BROTHER AND WEPT
HIS FOLK REJOICED IN THEIR COMRADE AND FORBIDDING HIM TO GO OUT AGAIN TO THE FIELD SENT FORTH ANOTHER TO WHOM SALLIED OUT ANOTHER MOSLEM BROTHER TO THE CAPTIVE AND OFFERED HIM BATTLE
THE SICK MAN LAY THERE TILL DAWN AND WHEN THE FOLK BEGAN TO GO ABOUT THE STREETS THEY SAW HIM AND STOOD GAZING ON HIM FOR HE HAD BECOME AS THIN AS A TOOTHPICK TILL THE SYNDIC OF THE BAZAR CAME UP AND DROVE THEM AWAY FROM HIM SAYING I WILL GAIN PARADISE THROUGH THIS POOR CREATURE
FN#219 THE TABLE OF WINE IN OUR DAY IS MOSTLY A JAPANNED TRAY WITH GLASSES AND BOTTLES SAUCERS OF PICKLES AND FRUITS AND PERHAPS A BUNCH OF FLOWERS AND AROMATIC HERBS
THEY HAVE A SCREEN OF WALL ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS LONG WITH A CENTRAL PRAYER-NICHE AND THE NORMAL THREE STEPS FOR THE PREACHER
UP AND OUT TO BATTLE BOUT AND BLADE SINGLE HANDED WIELD WITH ONE WHO HALVES WITH THEE THE FIELD
THE MAN MOST PIOUS IS MAN HAPPIEST
WITH THIS SHE INCLINED TOWARDS THE DAMSEL AND SAID DO THOU AS I HAVE DONE ALL THIS TIME SHARRKAN WAS GAZING AT THE TWAIN AND LAUGHING AT THE BELDAM'S LOATHLY SEMBLANCE
NOW THERE WERE BY HIS SIDE MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND HORSE AND ALL CHARGED WITH HIM AS MEN WHEN THE FAITHLESS FOUND NAUGHT TO SAVE THEIR LIVES BUT FLIGHT
FN#471 ALLUDING TO THE TRAVEL OF MOSES KORAN CHAPS
THEN WALKING A LITTLE WAY TOWARDS IT HE SAW THAT IT WAS ON THE ROAD WHEREBY HE HAD REACHED THE TOMB
EVERY ROUND THING IS NOT A WALNUT AND EVERY LONG THING A BANANA IS NOT
RETURN IS NOT TO A FRAMEWORK LERE AND LORN THAT LACKETH BLOOD AND LIFE A FRAME WHEREOF REMAINETH NAUGHT BUT BONES THAT RATTLE AND ROT
GERMAN ROYALTIES PREFER CARPENTERING AND LOUIS XVI WATCH-MAKING
HOW IS T I SPY THE HUNTER HUNTED FAIR MY HART BY THEE
FOR I WILL INFORM THEM THAT THEIR CHIEFS ARE DEAD AND WHEN THEY HEAR THAT FROM ME THEIR JOINING WILL BE DISJOINTED AND THE CORD OF THEIR CONFEDERATION CUT AND THEIR HOST SCATTERED
136-158 =754-775 FN#263 THE CELEBRATED COMPANION OF MOHAMMED WHO SUCCEEDED ABU BAKR IN THE CALIPHATE A.H
THE INFIDELS PASSED THAT NIGHT IN JOY AND JUBILEE AND WINE BIBBING
FN#533 ARAB
GARRED US THY GRACE IN FIGHT TO THROW THE GREEK WHO YET CAME BACK DIGHT IN WAR'S CRAMOISIE
ALLAH WILL OPEN REPEATED THE BADAWI

AND WHEN SHE LOOKED ON THEM AND SAW THAT THEY WERE BOTH OF DISTINGUISHED BEAUTY SHE WEPT FOR THEM AND SAID BY ALLAH THESE ARE PEOPLE OF CONDITION AND SHOW PLAIN SIGNS OF FORMER OPULENCE O MY LADY SAID THE SYNDIC'S WIFE WE LOVE THE POOR AND THE DESTITUTE MORE ESPECIALLY AS REWARD IN HEAVEN WILL RECOMPENSE OUR LOVE
BUT FOR WHAT REGARDS THE MERCHANT AND NAZHAT AL-ZAMAN WHEN HE TOOK HER HE THREW SOME OF HIS CLOTHES OVER HER AND CARRIED HER TO HIS LODGINGS,--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
A KNIGHT OF GOODLY PRESENCE OPENED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE ARMY OF UNBELIEVERS AND CIRCLED HITHER AND THITHER AMONGST THE DENIERS CUTTING AND THRUSTING AND COVERING THE GROUND WITH HEADS AND TRUNKS SO THAT THE FAITHLESS FEARED HIM AND THEIR NECKS BENT UNDER HIS LUNGE AND HEW
BUT THOU SHALT SURELY STAND THOU AND THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL BEFORE THE JUST JUDGE AND THOU SHALT BE JUSTIFIED OF HIM ON THE DAY WHEN THE LORD TO WHOM BE HONOUR AND GLORY SHALL BE KAZI AND THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN SHALL BE WITNESSES WHEN THE CALIPH HEARD HER COM PLAINT HE KNEW THAT SHE HAD BEEN WRONGED AND RETURNING TO THE PALACE SENT MASRUR THE EUNUCH FOR HER
AND THRUSTING TO THE FOOTMAN'S SPEAR AND THE HORSEMAN'S LANCE
PRESENTLY HE SHIFTED HIS HANDS TO HER SLENDER WAIST WHEN HIS FINGER TIPS SANK INTO THE SOFT FOLDS OF HER MIDDLE BREEDING LANGUISHMENT AND HE FELL A TREMBLING LIKE THE PERSIAN REED IN THE ROARING GALE
THEREBY HER FOREHEAD WAS CUT OPEN AND THE BLOOD RAN DOWN BUT SHE WAS SILENT AND DID NOT UTTER A SINGLE SOUND.[FN#498 PRESENTLY SHE ROSE UP AND MADE SOME TINDER OF RAGS THEN STAUNCHING WITH IT THE BLEEDING WOUND BOUND HER FOREHEAD WITH A BANDAGE
AND THE FIRST TO REACH HIM WERE THE WAZIR DANDAN AND THE EMIR OF THE TURKS BAHRAM AND THE EMIR OF THE DAYLAMITES RUSTAM
AND BEHOLD THE WICKET SUDDENLY OPENED AND I LOOKED UP AND SEEING HER FELL DOWN IN A SWOON
LAUGHED IN HIS FACE WHICH HAS NOT THE UNPLEASANT MEANING IT BEARS IN ENGLISH
NEVERTHELESS IF THOU CAN BE SURE OF THYSELF NOT TO SLEEP WHEN THOU RETURNEST TO HER RETURN TO HER AND BEWARE OF SLEEPING AND THOU SHALT ATTAIN THY DESIRE

SO ZAU AL-MAKAN OPENED HIS HAND TO THE ARMY AND GAVE A SUMPTUOUS ROBE OF HONOUR TO THE WAZIR DANDAN SAYING THOU CONTINUES IN OFFICE
THEN THE OLD WOMAN LEANT TOWARDS HER AND THE TWO LAID HOLD EITHER OF EACH WHILE SHARRKAN RAISED HIS HEAD HEAVENWARDS AND PRAYED ALLAH THAT THE BELLE MIGHT BEAT THE BELDAM
UPON IT WAS A COVERLET OF GREEN SATIN PURFLED WITH RED GOLD AND ABOVE IT HUNG A CANOPY ADORNED WITH PEARLS AND GEMS WHEREON SAT KING ZAHR SHAH WHILST HIS OFFICERS OF STATE STOOD IN ATTENDANCE BEFORE HIM
THE SETTLED PEOPLE CALL THEMSELVES OSMANLI OR OTHMANLI
AND ACCORDING TO ANOTHER TRADITION WHOSO EASETH HIS BROTHER OF ONE OF THE TROUBLES OF THIS TROUBLOUS WORLD ALLAH SHALL RELIEVE HIM OF SEVENTY AND TWO TROUBLES ON THE DAY OF RESURRECTION AND I HAVE BETAKEN MYSELF TO THEE
I HAVE NOT REWARDED HIM AS YET BUT INSHALLAH
ALAMIN PLUR NEVER ALAMAYN DUAL IS THE TRIREGNO DENOTED BY THE PAPAL TIARA THE THREE CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS BEING HEAVEN HELL AND PURGATORY
THEN EACH APPROACHED THE ADVERSARY AND HE SET HIS BREAST AGAINST HERS BUT WHEN HE FELT WAIST TOUCH WAIST HIS STRENGTH FAILED HIM
IT FLEW FROM HIS GRASP LIKE A SHOOTING STAR AND FOLK CLAMOURED AND FEARED FOR SHARRKAN
NOR INDEED HAD SHARRKAN HIMSELF BEEN HERE THIS NIGHT AND IT WERE SAID TO HIM CLEAR THIS STREAM COULD HE HAVE DONE IT
SHALL WE THEN DIE OF HUNGER
NOW THE FOLK HAD AGREED TO COME TO US AFTER THE FRIDAY PRAYERS
III SHOWS BY A SKETCH THE POSITION OF THE WORSHIPPER DURING THIS SALAM WHICH IS ADDRESSED SOME SAY TO THE GUARDIAN ANGELS OTHERS SUPPOSE TO ALL BROTHER-BELIEVERS AND ANGELS
SO I BROUGHT HIS HEAD TO YOU,"--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
AND HE AND THE WAZIR SAT UPON A THRONE WHILST ALL THE EMIRS AND GRANDEES AND OFFICERS OF STATE TOOK THEIR PLACES BEFORE THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL RANKS.[FN#324 THEN THEY MELTED SUGAR IN ROSE WATER AND DRANK AFTER WHICH THE EMIRS SAT DOWN TO HOLD COUNCIL AND PERMITTED THE REST OF THE HOST TO MOUNT AND RIDE FORWARD LEISURELY TILL THEY SHOULD MAKE AN END OF THEIR DEBATE AND OVERTAKE THEM
SO FAR CONCERNING THESE TWO
FOR IT HAD DONNED ITS ADORNMENTS AND DECKED ITSELF.[FN#417 GENTLY WAVED THE BRANCHES OF ITS TREES DRUNKEN WITH THE NEW WINE OF THE DEW AND COMBINED WITH THE NECTAR OF TASNIM THE SOFT BREATHINGS OF THE MORNING BREEZE
AND ACCORDING TO THE SHI'AHS WHO CALL HIM OTHMAN-I-LANG OR LIMPING OTHMAN HE VILELY MALTREATED THEM
WHEN THE EMPEROR OF THE GREEKS SENT A PRESENT OF SUPERIOR SWORD-BLADES TO HIM BY WAY OF A BRAVE THE CALIPH IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ENVOYS TOOK SAMSAM IN HAND AND CUT THE OTHERS IN TWAIN AS IF THEY WERE CABBAGES WITHOUT THE LEAST PREJUDICE TO THE EDGE OF SAMSAM FN#226 THIS TOUCH OF PATHOS IS TRULY ARAB
BESIDES MY PRESENCE MAY PROFIT AND AT ANY RATE BE PLEASING TO SHAYKH IBRAHIM O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL QUOTH JA'AFAR THE GREATER PART OF THE NIGHT IS PASSED AND AT THIS TIME THEY WILL BE BREAKING UP QUOTH THE CALIPH IT MATTERS NOT

FN#385 ARAB
YA KHARA
PRESENTLY SHARRKAN CRAVE AT HIM LIKE A LION ANGRY GRIM MOUNTED ON A COURSER LIKE A WILD GAZELLE FLYING SNELL AND SLIM
SUCH A THING CAN NEVER BE
FOR HE WHO KNOWETH THE FUTURE SHALL PROVIDE FOR THE FUTURE WITH THIS SHE BROUGHT THE WAZIR A CUP OF WINE AND HIS HEART WAS QUIETED AND HE CEASED TO FEEL WRATH AND FEAR
NOR CAN I UNDERSTAND HOW THOU HAST BEEN ALL THE TIME IN HER COMPANY YET SHE HATH NOT KILLED THEE NOR DONE THEE A MISCHIEF WHEN I HEARD HER WORDS I MARVELLED WITH EXCEEDING MARVEL AND SAID O MY LADY WHO MADE THEE TO KNOW HER SAID SHE I KNOW HER AS THE AGE KNOWETH ITS CALAMITIES
ADVISE ME OF WHAT COURSE AND CONTRIVANCE BE ADVISABLE WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS THE TEARS SPRANG FROM HIS EYES IN STREAMS AND HE REPLIED FAR BE IT FROM ME O KING OF THE AGE THAT I DEBATE ON THAT WHICH APPERTAINETH TO THE COMPASSIONATE ONE
THIS INCENSING DONE HE CALLED FOR LUKA BIN SHAMLUT SURNAMED THE SWORD OF THE MESSIAH
HE USED TINCTURES OF HENNA AND KATAM FOR HIS BEARD
FN#90 ARAB
BUT HE WITHAL WHOSE DAYS ARE SUMMER BRIGHT WHOM MAIDS E'ER GREET WITH SMILING LIPS DELIGHT
AND WHEREOF THE CLASSICS SANG FOLLE DECET PUEROS LUDERE FOLLE SENES
THIS WORTHY GAVE TWO DAMSELS TO MOHAMMED
AFTER WHICH THE WAZIR AROSE AND FETCHING THE GIFTS AND RARITIES AND PRECIOUS THINGS LAID THEM ALL BEFORE THE KING
THE CALIPH ALSO PULLED OFF HIS PERSON TWO VESTS OF ALEXANDRIAN AND BA'LBAK SILK A LOOSE INNER ROBE AND A LONG-SLEEVED OUTER COAT AND SAID TO THE FISHERMAN TAKE THEM AND PUT THEM ON WHILE HE ASSUMED THE FOUL GABERDINE AND FILTHY TURBAND AND DREW A CORNER OF THE HEAD-CLOTH AS A MOUTH-VEIL[FN#56 BEFORE HIS FACE
I CONJURE THEE NEVER LEAVE ME TO HEAR IS TO OBEY REPLIED I

INDEED SHE HATH DELIVERED THEE FROM ME FOR I MINDED TO DO THEE A MISCHIEF BUT NOW I WILL NOT HARM THEE NOR TROUBLE THEE I WONDERED AT THIS AND ASKED HER WHAT THEN WEST THOU MINDED TO DO WITH ME IN TIME PAST AND WE TWO BEING IN BOND OF LOVE ANSWERED SHE THOU ART INFATUATED WITH ME
AND THEY ANSWERED O PRINCESS IT IS NOT OUR CUSTOM TO ASK LEAVE OF THEE FOR THE KING'S MESSENGERS AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE CHIEF OF HIS KNIGHTS QUOTH SHE I THINK YE WERE MINDED ONLY TO DISGRACE ME AND MURDER MY GUEST AND BADE SHARRKAN SMITE THEIR NECKS
WHAT WILT THOU DO WHEN FRO THEE I'M GONE QUOTH I SAY THIS TO WHOM LIFE REMAINS WHEN THE CALIPH HEARD HER SAYING IN HER VERSE TO KARIM THE CREAM OF MEN THOU GAVEST ME HIS INCLINATION FOR HER REDOUBLED AND IT SEEMED A HARD MATTER AND A GRIEVOUS TO PART THEM
FN#506 VULGARLY CALLED KNUCKLE-BONE CONCERNING WHICH I SHALL HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
AS SOON AS SHE HAD TAKEN SEAT THERE THE KING CAME IN TO HER AND ALLAH FILLED HIS HEART WITH HER LOVE SO HE ABATED HER MAIDENHEAD AND CEASED FROM HIM HIS TROUBLE AND DISQUIET
AND QUOTH HE I AM AN AMBASSADOR FROM KING AFRIDUN FOR I COUNSELLED HIM TO AVERT THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL THESE FRAMES OF MEN AND TEMPLES OF THE COMPASSIONATE ONE
FN#111 IN THE ARAB
FOR ZAU AL-MAKAN WAS STILL INSENSIBLE AND WHEN HIS COMPANION SAW THE EUNUCH STANDING BY HIS HEAD HE WAS AFRAID OF HIM
FN#387 ARAB
HE ABODE WITH HER WELL NIGH A MONTH BUT SHE HAD CONCEIVED BY HIM THE FIRST NIGHT

FN#253 I.E
NOW WHEN ALL THE CAPTIVES WERE SAFE FROM THE UNFAITHFUL SHARRKAN CAME UP WITH HIS COMRADES AND FOUND THEM AWAITING HIS ARRIVAL ON COALS OF FLAME EXPECTING HIM IN ANXIOUS GRAME SO HE TURNED TO THEM AND SAID FEEL NO FEAR SINCE ALLAH PROTECTETH US
MARCH THEY TOOK HORSE ON THE INSTANT AND FARED THROUGH THE FIRST DAY AND SECOND AND THIRD DAY NOR DID THEY CEASE FARING FOR FIVE DAYS
NO PATIENCE IN SUCH PLIGHT I'M WONT TO SHOW THEN HE REDOUBLED HIS WEEPING AND THE FIREMAN SAID TO HIM WEEP NOT BUT RATHER PRAISE ALLAH FOR SAFETY AND RECOVERY ASKED ZAU AL-MAKAN HOW FAR IS IT HENCE TO DAMASCUS ANSWERED THE OTHER SIX DAYS JOURNEY THEN QUOTH ZAU AL-MAKAN WILT THOU SEND ME THITHER O MY LORD QUOTH THE STOKER HOW CAN I ALLOW THEE TO GO ALONE AND THOU A YOUTH AND A STRANGER TO BOOT

AND LOVER CURE OF ACCESS
AND HE SAID VERILY ONE COMETH WHO SHALL DISPUTE WITH ME THE SOVEREIGNTY SO QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF IF THIS CONCUBINE BEAR A MALE CHILD I WILL KILL IT BUT HE KEPT THAT INTENTION HIDDEN IN HIS HEART
FOR I HAVE NOW BEEN THIRTY DAYS WITHOUT TASTING THE FOOD OF SLEEP THEREUPON THE CALIPH SENT FOR JA'AFAR AND SAID TO HIM O JA'AFAR TIS THIRTY DAYS SINCE WE HAVE HAD NEWS OF NUR AL-DIN BIN KHAKAN AND I CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT THE SULTAN HATH SLAIN HIM
AND THE SAGE KNOWS ONLY THREE INTEMPERANCE IGNORANCE AND EGOISM
I CAME WITH MY BROTHER FROM THE LAND OF AL-HIJAZ AND I FEARLESS HE KNOW NOT WHERE I AM WHEN THE BADAWI HEARD THIS HE SAID TO HIMSELF BY ALLAH I HAVE GOT MY DESIRE THEN HE TURNED TO HER AND REPLIED THERE SHALL NONE BE DEARER TO ME THAN THOU

WHEN HE LAMENTED AND SIGHED AND BECAME DROWNED IN SEA OF SADNESS AND REPEATED I AM NOT LOST TO PRUDENCE BUT INDEED HERE I'M BEWILDERED WHAT SHALL BE MY REDE
SHE KISSED THE HEAD OF HER BROTHER AND EMBRACED HIM AND WENT FORTH FROM HIM WEEPING AND KNOWING NOT WHITHER SHE SHOULD WEND
FOR HER SONG GAVE HEARING TO EARS STONE-DEAF WHILE BRAVA
IS STILL UNIVERSALLY THE CUSTOM
AND YOUR FATHER'S ENTRY INTO PARADISE IS LIEFER TO HIM THAN THAT YE SHOULD BE WELL TO DO.[FN#294 SO ARISE AND GO ALLAH BE YOUR HELPER FOR TO HIM I COMMIT YOUR AFFAIRS KHALID BIN SAFWAN[FN#295 SAID YUSUF BIN OMAR[FN#296 ACCOMPANIED ME TO HISHAM BIN ABD AL-MALIK,[FN#297 AND AS I MET HIM HE WAS COMING FORTH WITH HIS KINSMEN AND ATTENDANTS

THEN HE CALLED FOR A LITTER AND THEREIN LAYING HIS DEAD DAUGHTER RETURNED TO CAESAREA AND CARRIED HER INTO THE PALACE WHERE HE WENT IN TO HIS MOTHER ZAT AL-DAWAHI AND SAID TO THAT LADY OF CALAMITIES SHALL THE MOSLEMS DEAL THUS WITH MY GIRL
HE TALKED WITH HER THROUGH PART OF THE NIGHT THEN HE STRETCHED HIMSELF TO REST
THEN THEY CAME ROUND HER AND TOOK OFF HER DRESSES EASING HER OF THE WEIGHT OF HER CLOTHES AND BEGAN TO LOOK UPON HER BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS
WHEN THE KING SAW THE STATE OF THINGS AND FOUND A LIGHTED CANDLE AT HER HEAD AND ANOTHER AT HER FEET SHINING UPON WHAT HER THIGHS ENSHRINED HE TOOK LEAVE OF HIS FIVE SENSES FOR LUST AND SATAN SEDUCED HIM AND HE COULD NOT MASTER HIMSELF BUT PUT OFF HIS TROUSERS AND FELL UPON HER AND ABATED HER MAIDEN HEAD

AFTER WHICH SHE CUT IT UP AND BRINGING IT TO ZAU AL-MAKAN SAID EAT O MY SON WHILE HE WAS EATING
WHEN IT WAS THE EIGHTY-NINTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING ALL THIS WAS A STRATAGEM OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN FOR THAT THE KING BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE HAD GONE TO HER AND ASKED HOW SHALL I DO AND WHAT PLAN SHALL I PURSUE
AND THEY CURSED ME AND REVILED ME WHILE I STOOD LAUGHING AND GRINNING AT THEM TILL AT LAST I ASKED HOW SHALL MY MASTER SLAY ME WHEN HE BOUGHT ME WITH THIS MY BLEMISH THEN MY MASTER RETURNED HOME AND FOUND HIS HOUSE IN RUINS AND IT WAS I WHO HAD LAID WASTE THE GREATER PART OF IT,[FN#101 HAVING BROKEN THINGS WHICH WERE WORTH MUCH MONEY AS ALSO HAD DONE HIS WIFE WHO SAID TO HIM TWAS KAFUR WHO BROKE THE VESSELS AND CHINAWARE THEREUPON HIS RAGE REDOUBLED AND HE STRUCK HAND UPON HAND EXCLAIMING BY ALLAH

THEREAT THE MOSLEMS WERE GLAD AND THEIR HEARTS WERE HEARTENED
WHEN THE EMIR BAHRAM AND THE EMIR RUSTAM AND THE CHIEF CHAMBERLAIN WITH THE MOSLEM HOST AND FLAGS FLAUNTING HIGH AHEAD CAME IN SIGHT OF CONSTANTINOPLE THEY SAW THAT THE NAZARENES HAD MOUNTED THE WALLS AND MANNED THE TOWERS AND THE FORTS AND HAD SET ALL THEIR DEFENDERS IN ORDER OF DEFENCE AS SOON AS THEY LEARNED OF THE APPROACH OF THE HOST OF AL-ISLAM AND THE BANNERS MOHAMMEDAN AND THEY HEARD THE CLASH OF ARMS AND THE NOISE OF WAR VOICES AND TRAMP OF HORSE HOOFS AND FROM THEIR LOOK OUTS THEY BEHELD THE MOSLEMS WITH THEIR STANDARDS AND ENSIGNS OF THE FAITH OF UNITY UNDER THE DUST CLOUDS AND LO
AND THE PAGES AND THE EUNUCHS PICKED UP THIS LARGESSE
FOR TO THIS EFFECT AM I INSTRUCTED BY HIM SO THE WAZIR WENT DOWN FROM BEFORE HIM AND MADE READY FOR HIS MARCH
BY ALLAH I HAVE DESIRED THEE DAY AFTER DAY BUT COULD NOT GET AT THEE TILL THIS TIME WHEN I TRICKED THEE AND OUTWITTED THEE
AND AS SOON AS SHE SAW THE WIVES OF THE EMIRS AND WAZIRS AND GRANDEES OF THE REALM COMING TO CALL UPON HER SHE AROSE TO THEM ON HER FEET AND MET THEM WITH COURTESY HER HANDMAIDENS STANDING BEHIND HER AND SHE RECEIVED THEM SAYING YE BE WELCOME THE WHILE SHE SMILED IN THEIR FACES SO AS TO WIN THEIR HEARTS
MOREOVER I HAVE REGAINED MY PRESENCE OF MIND WHEN SHE HEARD HIS WORDS SHE SAID TO HIM HAST THOU NOT HAD A BELLY FULL OF THIS WRESTLING O VANQUISHED ONE
SO DO THOU SEND FOR A CARPENTER AND BID HIM MAKE THEE A FIGURE OF WOOD IN THE FORM OF A CORPSE
TIS HARD TO WIN THEE BACK THE HEART OFFENDED
SO I REPAIRED TO THE GARDEN AND WENT UP INTO THAT SAME PAVILION AND OCCUPIED MYSELF IN GAZING UPON THE FLOWER BEDS AND IN HOLDING MY EYELIDS OPEN WITH MY FINGERS AND NODDING MY HEAD AS THE NIGHT DARKENED ON ME
I SEE THIS WORLD IS ONLY CHEAT AND VANITY WHERE MAN NAUGHT ELSE MUST SEEK BUT PLEASE THE TRUTHFUL ONE
QUOTH SHE I COMMEND THEE TO ALLAH'S CARE WHEREAT QUOTH HE AND WHEN SHALL I SEE THEE AGAIN O PIOUS LADY
SEE I AM NOW COME TO MYSELF O MY LADY HE REPLIED THREE SLAVE EUNUCHS CAME HERE BEARING THIS CHEST AND RELATED TO HER THE WHOLE OF WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM AND HOW EVENING HAVING CLOSED UPON HIM HAD PROVED THE CAUSE OF HER PRESERVATION OTHERWISE SHE HAD DIED SMOTHERED.[FN#106 THEN HE ASKED HER WHO SHE WAS AND WHAT WAS HER STORY AND SHE ANSWERED O YOUTH THANKS BE TO ALLAH WHO HATH CAST ME INTO THE HANDS OF THE LIKE OF THEE
GEE-RUSALEM
IF IT BE A TRADER OR THE LIKE TELL ME
HOWEVER SHE TOOK MY HEART WITH HER SO I SAT TILL SUN DOWN EXPECTING HER AGAIN TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW
WHEREUPON BOTH SAT DOWN TO EAT AND ATE THEIR SUFFICIENCY WHEN HE SET ON WINE
THE LIBAN SHAMI SYRIAN INCENSE A FIR GUM IMPORTED FROM SCIO IS MELTED AND ALLOWED TO COOL IN THE FORM OF A PLEDGET
SO WHEN HE HEARD THE REPORT OF THE MONK THAT SHARRKAN AGREED TO THE DUELLO HE WAS LIKE TO FLY FOR EXCEEDING JOY BECAUSE HE HAD SELF CONFIDENCE AND HE KNEW THAT NONE COULD WITH STAND HIM
FOR SPRING WAS COME BRIGHTENING THE PLACE WITH JOY AND DELIGHT
BY ALLAH GOOD
BUT WHEN THE ACCURSED OLD WOMAN SENSED HIS FOOTSTEPS SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS FOLLOWING HER
NOW AL-FAZL WAS THE MOST GENEROUS OF THE PEOPLE OF HIS AGE UPRIGHT OF LIFE SO THAT ALL HEARTS UNITED IN LOVING HIM AND THE WISE FLOCKED TO HIM FOR COUNSEL
HO PEOPLE OF THE TRUE FAITH
WHEN IT WAS THE NINETY-EIGHTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE UNFAITHFUL HAD SEIZED UPON KING ZAU AL-MAKAN AND THE WAZIR DANDAN THEY SAID TO THE TWO IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WITH YOU TWAIN THAT WE MAY SEIZE UPON HIM ALSO AND THE WAZIR DANDAN REPLIED SEE YOU NOT YON OTHER MAN WHO BE WITH US THEY REJOINED BY THE TRUTH OF THE MESSIAH AND THE MONKS AND THE PRIMATE AND THE METROPOLITAN WE SEE NONE SAVE YOU TWO THEN THE INFIDELS LAID SHACKLES ON THEIR FEET AND SET MEN TO GUARD THEM DURING THE NIGHT WHILST ZAT AL-DAWAHI FARED ON AND DISAPPEARED FROM THEIR SIGHT
SO THEY HALTED IN IT OTHER THREE DAYS AND ON THE EIGHTH THEY ESPIED A DUST CLOUD WHICH TOWERED TILL IT WALLED THE WHOLE LAND
AT WHICH HE WAS ANGERED WITH EXCEEDING ANGER.[FN#43 BUT HE TOOK PATIENCE TILL ONE DAY WHEN THE CALIPH CAME TO HIS GARDEN

AND AS THEY AWOKE AND THEY WERE ABOUT TO LOAD THE BEASTS BEHOLD THERE APPEARED AFAR OFF A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST THAT DARKENED THE FIRMAMENT TILL IT BECAME BLACK AS GLOOMIEST NIGHT.[FN#323 THEREUPON THE CHAMBERLAIN CRIED OUT TO THEM STAY AND YOUR LOADING DELAY
AND EACH EXTREMITY IS GARNISHED WITH AN IMITATION MINARET
WHEN HE SAW THE SHROUD AND WOULD HAVE REMOVED IT TO LOOK UPON HER THE FEAR OF ALLAH ALMIGHTY RESTRAINED HIM AND THE OLD WOMAN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE DELAY SAID RESTORE HER TO HER PLACE THEN HE SENT AT ONCE FOR FAKIRS AND KORAN READERS AND CAUSED PERFECTIONS TO BE MADE OVER HER TOMB AND SAT BY THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE WEEPING TILL HE FAINTED
SPARE TO ME THY BLAME MY LORD HATH SENT THIS DULE TO DREE OF FRIEND WHO LEFT ME FAIN TO FLEE
THEN HE FETCHED A CLEAN SHIRT AND PUT IT ON HIM

FOR THIS HAJJ AL AKBAR SEE MY PILGRIMAGE III
BUT IT WAS DONE BY THE MUKAUKIS OR COPTIC GOVERNOR OF EGYPT UNDER HERACLIUS WHO OF COURSE HATED THE GREEKS
AND SHE THOUGHT OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI AND OF HER SEVERANCE FROM HER MOTHER AND FATHER AND NATIVE LAND
AFTER WE BAR THE DOOR
THEREUPON GHANIM ROSE AND LIT THE LAMPS AND WAX CANDLES AND REFRESHED THE ROOM AND REMOVED THE TABLE
AND SHE HAD PROFESSED JUDAISM IN THE HOLY CITY OF JERUSALEM[FN#409 FOR TWO YEARS SPACE THAT SHE MIGHT MASTER THE MAGIC OF MEN AND DEMONS
AND BEING AFRAID HE REPLIED BY ALLAH TWAS NOT I REJOINED THE EUNUCH WHO THEN WAS THE RECITER
AND HE WAS PERPLEXED ABOUT THE CASE BECAUSE AFTER SO LONG A TIME HE COULD NOT SEND TO KING OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN AND DEMAND HER BACK FROM HIM ESPECIALLY AS HE HAD LATELY HEARD THAT HEAVEN HAD GRANTED HIM BOON OF BABE BY THIS SOPHIA
OF WOMEN A RAVISHER
OF THE TWO ARMIES LOOKING ON SOME SAID SHARRKAN IS VICTOR AND OTHERS AFRIDUN WILL CONQUER
FN#89 I.E
AND WHEN THE SULTAN WHO WAS SITTING IN THE PALACE DESCRIED THIS HE SAID TO HIS SUITE GO AND SEE WHAT YON CLOUD BRINGETH REPLIED AL MU'IN NOT TILL WE HAVE SMITTEN THIS FELLOW'S NECK BUT THE SULTAN SAID WAIT YE TILL WE SEE WHAT THIS MEANETH NOW THE DUST-CLOUD WAS THE DUST OF J'AFAR THE BARMECIDE WAZIR TO THE CALIPH AND HIS HOST
AND WHEN HE SAW HER HE ROSE TO HER SAYING WELCOME O PIOUS LADY O KING QUOTH SHE THE INVISIBLE CONTROULS SALUTE THEE FOR I TOLD THEM OF THEE AND THEY REJOICED IN THEE AND HAVE SENT THEE THEIR HALWA,[FN#374 WHICH IS OF THE SWEETMEATS OF THE OTHER WORLD
TILL AT LAST WHEN THEY ARE WEARIED WITH THINE IMPORTUNITY THEY WILL SAY SHOW US THE CHEQUE THEN AS SOON AS THEY HAVE GOT HOLD OF IT THEY WILL TEAR IT UP AND SO THOU WILT LOSE THE GIRL'S PRICE WHEN NUR AL-DIN HEARD THIS HE LOOKED AT THE BROKER AND ASKED HIM HOW SHALL THIS MATTER BE MANAGED
FOR HEARTS INDEED WHENCE LOVE IS ALIEN MADE LIKE BROKEN GLASS MAY NEVERMORE BE MENDED THE MAIDEN CONTINUED AND CONCLUDED WITH POINTING OUT TO US WHAT SAGES SAY THE BEST OF BRETHREN IS HE WHO IS THE MOST CONSTANT IN GOOD COUNSEL
THEN SHE LEFT THE TENT AND MADE FOR THE SULTAN'S PAVILION BUT FINDING THE GUARDS ON THE ALERT TURNED TO THAT OF THE WAZIR DANDAN
FN#325 OTHERWISE ALL WOULD BE SUPERSEDED LIKE U
THE SLAVE HERE LAYS DOWN THE LAW INCORRECTLY BUT HIS CLAIM SHOWS HIS TRULY NIGGER IMPUDENCE
I HAVE A HANDY LIMBER SPEAR FULL BRIGHT AND KEEN OF POINT UPON WHOSE SHAFT THE DAM OF DEATH HER THRONY SEAT HATH TA'EN
AS SOON AS ALMIGHTY ALLAH BROUGHT THE DAWN THE HANDMAID MARJANAH WASHED HER MISTRESS'S HANDS AND FEET AND BROUGHT ROSE WATER AND BATHED HER FACE AND MOUTH WITH IT WHERE UPON SHE SNEEZED AND YAWNED AND CAST UP FROM HER INSIDE THAT BIT OF BHANG LIKE A BOLUS.[FN#220 THEN SHE REVIVED AND WASHED HER HANDS AND MOUTH AND SAID TO MARJANAH TELL ME WHAT HATH BEFALLEN ME SO SHE TOLD HER WHAT HAD PASSED AND HOW SHE HAD FOUND HER LYING ON HER BACK WITH THE BLOOD RUNNING DOWN WHEREFORE SHE KNEW THAT KING OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN HAD LAIN WITH HER AND HAD UNDONE HER AND TAKEN HIS WILL OF HER
AFTER WHICH SHE DREW IN HER HEAD AND CLOSED THE WICKET SHUTTER AND WENT HER WAYS
WHENCE PROBABLY THE MODERNS HAVE DERIVED THE DIM
WHEN THE HOUR OF NIGHT PRAYER CAME I WAS MINDED TO REPAIR TO MY LOVER
HIS FACE INCLINED TO YELLOW AND WAS POCK-MARKED
WHAT THEN CAN BE TO ME THE SEED OF WHORESON SLAVE WHEN GHAZBAN HEARD THESE LINES HE WAS WROTH EXCEEDINGLY
AND BEWARE OF BETRAYING A BELIEVER FOR WHOSO BETRAYETH A BELIEVER BETRAYETH ALLAH AND HIS APOSTLE
FULL OFT WHEN JOY SEEMS FARTHEST FAR THOU NIGHMOST ART TO HOUR OF JOY THEN SHE DREW NEAR TO ME AND BEGAN TO COMFORT ME WITH SOOTHING SPEECH BUT DARED NOT BRING ME AUGHT OF FOOD FEARING LEST I BE ANGRY WITH HER AND HOPING I MIGHT INCLINE TO HER
I SEE ME SWEETHEART DEAD AND GONE ERE I AGAIN SHALL GAZE ON THEE
LIKE GLASSWORT AND OTHER PLANTS
THE CHAMBERLAIN ACQUAINTED THEM WITH THE KING'S COMMANDS TO WHICH THEY REPLIED WE HEAR AND WE OBEY AND ALL DREW UP BEFORE THE PAVILION ENTRANCE
I FORCE MYSELF TO TURN FROM THEE IN DEADLY FRIGHT OF SPIES
I CARE NAUGHT FOR HIS PROWESS SO HE RUSHED OUT TOWARDS ZAU AL-MAKAN BRAND IN HAND AND UNDER HIM A STALLION LIKE ABJAR WHICH WAS ANTAR'S CHARGER AND ITS COAT WAS JET BLACK EVEN AS SAITH THE POET ON THE GLANCING RACER OUTRACING GLANCE HE SPEEDS AS THOUGH HE WOULD COLLAR DOOM
THEN QUOTH SHE PRAISED BE ALLAH WHO HATH VOUCHSAFED THEE TO ME AND ORDAINED THAT EVEN AS WE LEFT OUR FATHER TOGETHER SO TOGETHER SHALL WE RETURN TO HIM AND SHE ADDED OF A TRUTH MY BROTHER SHARRKAN GAVE ME IN MARRIAGE TO THIS CHAMBERLAIN THAT HE MIGHT CARRY ME TO MY FATHER
BUT WHEN THE IDOLATERS BEHELD THE STANDARDS MOHAMMEDAN AND THERE ON THE PROFESSION OF FAITH ISLAMITAN PROCLAIMING THE UNITY THEY SHRIEKED WOE AND RUIN AND BESOUGHT SUCCOUR OF THE PATRIARCHS OF THE MONASTERIES
VERILY THOU KNEWEST HER PROWESS BY HER PERFORMANCE UPON THE OTHERS SO HE DREW NEAR THEM TO HEAR WHAT SHOULD PASS BETWEEN THEM
SO IF YE WOULD ATTACK HIM COME OUT AGAINST HIM ONE AFTER ONE THAT IT MAY APPEAR TO THE KING WHICH IS THE VALIANT QUOTH MASURAH THE KNIGHT BY THE TRUTH OF THE MESSIAH THOU SAYEST SOOTH AND NONE BUT I SHALL SALLY OUT AGAINST HIM FIRST QUOTH SHE WAIT TILL I GO TO HIM AND ACQUAINT HIM WITH THE CASE AND HEAR WHAT ANSWER HE WILL MAKE
AND ZAU AL-MAKAN ENQUIRED ABOUT THE LOADS AND THEIR OWNER AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS THE TRIBUTE OF DAMASCUS GOING TO KING OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN LORD OF THE CITY OF BAGHDAD
WHEN HER DEVICE SUCCEEDED SHE BADE PUT ME IN THIS CHEST AND SECRETLY BROUGHT IN THE SLAVES AND THE DOORKEEPERS AND BRIBED THEM
THAT THERE IS NO MEANS OF DRAWING NEAR TO GOD LIKE GOOD MORALS NO MEASURE LIKE GOOD BREEDING NO TRAFFIC LIKE GOOD WORKS AND NO PROFIT LIKE EARNING THE DIVINE FAVOUR
NEVER WAS SEEN MAN OR WOMAN OF FAIRER FACE THAN HE AND HE WAS THE MOST COMELY OF MEN HE WAS ESPECIALLY FAMED FOR BEAUTIFUL TEETH WHICH IN OLD AGE HE BOUND ABOUT WITH GOLD WIRE
OF A TRUTH OTHERS ARE OCCUPIED WITH LOVE FOR YEARS AND ENDURE WITH CONSTANCY THE ARDOUR OF PASSION WHILST THOU HAST BUT A WEEK TO WAIT
AND BEFORE LONG SHE CAME WITH TEN DAMSELS IN WHOSE MIDST SHE WAS LIKE THE FULL MOON AMONG THE STARS
CAST OFF AMBITIOUS HOPES AND VAIN DESIRES HOW MANY A DEATH WAS DONE BY VAIN DESIRE AMONG THE SAYINGS OF SUFYAN AL-THAURI WITH WHICH HE ADMONISHED ALI BIN AL-HASAN AL-SALAMI WAS BE THOU A MAN OF TRUTH AND WARE LIES AND TREACHERY AND HYPOCRISY AND PRIDE
AND OF THE WORLD TO COME GREEDIEST
WHEN HE HAD DONE EATING SHE FETCHED HOT WATER AND HE WASHED HIS HANDS AND LAY BACK UPON THE PILLOW WHEREUPON SHE COVERED HIM UP WITH THE COVERLET AND HE SLEPT TILL THE TIME OF THE MID AFTERNOON PRAYER
THE FIRST THAT HE SHOULD NOT RIDE THE BAGGAGE BEASTS THE SECOND THAT HE SHOULD NOT WEAR FINE CLOTHES THE THIRD THAT HE SHOULD NOT EAT OF THE SPOIL AND THE FOURTH THAT HE SHOULD NOT PUT OFF PRAYING TILL AFTER THE PROPER PERIOD
FN#237 USED BY WAY OF SOAP
THEN HE STARTED FROM SLEEP AND FOUND HIMSELF AMONG THE TREES AND THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE BRIGHTLY OVER THE TWO HORIZONS EASTERN AND WESTERN
FN#53 I.E
FOR VERILY THOU HAST DEALT WITH ME MORE LOVINGLY THAN ONE WITH HIS BROTHER THEN HE WAITED TILL IT WAS DARK NIGHT WHEN HE LAID THE PROVISIONS AND BAGGAGE ON THAT ASS AND SET FORTH UPON THEIR JOURNEY
THAN THEE THE PLEIAD-STARS MORE CHANCE OF HAPPY MEETING SHOW PARTING AND BANISHMENT AND LONGING PAIN AND LOWE OF LOVE PROCRASTINATING[FN#478 AND DELAY THESE ILLS MY LIFE LAY LOW
THEN TO SELL HER COMPELLED MY SORROW INCREASED
WHEN THESE MERCHANTS CAME TO CONSTANTINOPLE AND SOLD THEIR MERCHANDISE THAT IMAGE WHICH IS ON THE WALL SPOKE TO THEM BY GRACE OF A MARVEL WHICH ALLAH GRANTED TO ME
ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR HE WENT AS WAS HIS WONT TO THE EXCHANGE WHICH WAS IN THE BAZAR BUT FOUND THE GATE SHUT

HENCE THE SCRUPULOUS WILL BREAK UP WITH STICK OR KNIFE THE HARD GROUND IN FRONT OF THEM

HE CEASED NOT TO DO THUS FOR TWO WHOLE MONTHS WITHOUT SHOWING HIS FACE TO HIS PARENT TILL AT LAST HIS MOTHER SAID TO HIS FATHER O MY LORD SHALL WE LOSE OUR BOY AS WELL AS THE GIRL
AND HE CONTINUED TO FREQUENT THE TOMB AND SIT THERE FOR A WHOLE MONTH AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
AND SHE HATH BEEN WITH HIM THESE FOUR MONTHS WHILST OUR LORD IS WEEPING AND WATCHING BY NIGHT AT A TOMB WHEREIN IS NO CORPSE THEY KEPT ON TALKING THIS SORT OF TALK AND THE CALIPH GAVE EAR TO THEIR WORDS

O CASSIA SPRAY
PRESENTLY HE ROSE AND WENT FORTH FROM THE TENT SAYING IN HIMSELF I WILL GO TO SHARRKAN AND CHAT WITH HIM TILL MORNING BUT WHEN HE ENTERED INTO SHARRKAN'S PAVILION HE FOUND THE BLOOD RUNNING LIKE AN AQUEDUCT AND SAW THE SERVANTS LYING WITH THEIR THROATS CUT LIKE BEASTS FOR FOOD
FOR YE HAVE THE EXAMPLE OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BEFORE YOU OF THE PEOPLE OF MOHAMMED
WHEN ZAU AL-MAKAN AND HIS BROTHER SHARRKAN AND THE MINISTER DANDAN LOOKED UPON THIS HOST THEY SAW THAT IT WAS A NUMEROUS ARMY AND SAID WHO CAN HAVE GIVEN THESE TROOPS INFORMATION OF US REPLIED SHARRKAN O MY BROTHER THIS BE NO TIME FOR TALK
AND I WILL BE EASY WITH HIM ABOUT HER PRICE THEN ONE OF THE MERCHANTS CAME UP TO HIM AND ASKED HOW OLD IS SHE HE ANSWERED SHE IS A VIRGIN JUST COME TO MARRIAGEABLE AGE AND SHE IS ENDOWED WITH SENSE AND BREEDING AND WIT AND BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS

BUT AS REGARDS THE MOHAMMEDEN ARMY THEY INDEED AFTER ALLAH HAD GIVEN THEM VICTORY OVER THEIR ENEMIES AND THEY HAD PLUNDERED EVERYTHING IN THE SHIPS OF MONEY AND HOARDS ALL SAT DOWN TO CONVERSE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND ZAU AL-MAKAN SAID TO HIS BROTHER SHARRKAN VERILY ALLAH HATH GRANTED US TO PREVAIL BECAUSE OF OUR JUST DEALING AND DISCIPLINE AND CONCORD AMONGST OURSELVES
BUT WE WILL SERVE THEE EVEN AS SHE ORDERED SO THEY SET BEFORE HIM VIANDS OF RARE VARIETIES AND HE ATE HIS SUFFICIENCY WHEN THEY BROUGHT HIM A BASIN OF GOLD AND AN EWER OF SILVER AND HE WASHED HIS HANDS

FOR SHE HAD VOWED HERSELF TO THE MESSIAH AND RODE WITH DAKIANUS IN THE HABIT OF A CAVALIER SO THAT ALBEIT NONE MIGHT COMPARE WITH HER IN LOVELINESS NO ONE WHO SAW HER KNEW HER FOR A WOMAN
THEN HE TOOK TEN OF THEM AND CARRIED THEM THROUGH THE VESTIBULE INTO THE PRESENCE OF SULTAN ZAU AL-MAKAN WHOM WHEN THEY SAW THEY WERE AWED
THEN THEY GATHERED IN A BODY AND WENT IN TO THE CHAMBERLAIN AND DID THEIR SERVICE TO HIM KISSING THE GROUND BETWEEN HIS HANDS
AND THEY REPLIED NONE BUT THE GATE KEEPERS WHEREUPON SHE WENT UP TO SHARRKAN AND TOOK HIM TO HER BOSOM HE DOING THE SAME AND THEY RETURNED TO THE PALACE AFTER HE HAD MADE AN END OF THE MELEE
AT THIS SIGHT HE MADE SURE OF DEATH AND DESCENDING STOOD BEFORE THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WHO SAID TO HIM O JA'AFAR PRAISE BE TO ALLAH WHO HATH MADE US OF THOSE THAT OBSERVE EXTERNAL ORDINANCES OF HOLY LAW AND HATH AVERTED FROM US THE SIN OF DISGUISING OURSELVES AFTER THE MANNER OF HYPOCRITES!"[FN#54 BUT JA'AFAR COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD FOR EXCESS OF CONFUSION

AND SHE REPLIED IT IS WHAT I QUIET THEM WITHAL AND ALLAH WILL QUESTION OMAR BIN AL KHATTAB OF THEM ON THE DAY OF DOOM HE SAID AND WHAT SHOULD OMAR KNOW OF THEIR CASE WHY THEN REJOINED SHE SHOULD HE MANAGE PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS AND YET BE UNMINDFUL OF THEM THEREUPON OMAR TURNED TO ME CONTINNED ASLAM AND CRIED COME WITH US SO WE SET OFF RUNNING TILL WE REACHED THE PAY DEPARTMENT OF HIS TREASURY WHERE HE TOOK OUT A SACK CONTAINING FLOUR AND A POT HOLDING FAT AND SAID TO ME LOAD THESE ON MY BACK QUOTH I O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I WILL CARRY THEM FOR THEE HE REJOINED WILT THOU BEAR MY LOAD FOR ME ON THE DAY OF RESURRECTION SO I PUT THE THINGS ON HIS BACK AND WE SET OFF RUNNING TILL WE THREW DOWN THE SACK HARD BY HER

AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY
AND WE HAD RECITATIONS OF THE WHOLE KORAN OVER HER TOMB AND WE ABODE BY HER GRAVE THREE DAYS AFTER WHICH WE RETURNED TO OUR HOME AND I GRIEVING FOR HER GRIEVOUSLY
TILL IN SO DOING A FULL MONTH HAD SPED AND THE FIGHTING MEN FLOCKED TO THEM IN A CONTINUOUS BODY

FOR THEY WERE WONT WHEN THEY SAW THEM TO BE STRENUOUS IN OFFERING ON THEIR BEHALF PRAYERS AND PETITIONS EVER GRANTED
WHEN IT WAS THE NINETY-FIFTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE NAZARENES WHO WORE MERCHANTS WEED WHEN BROUGHT TO A PRIVATE PLACE BY ZAU AL-MAKAN AND HIS BROTHER SHARRKAN LAID BARE TO BOTH OF THEM THE STORY OF THE DEVOTEE AND WEPT TILL THEY MADE THE TWO KINGS WEEP AND REPEATED TO THEM ALL WHICH HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY THE OLD WITCH ZAT AL-DAWAHI
AND NOW TIS MIDNIGHT AND WE HAVE NO BREATH LEFT TO OPEN A TOMB AND BURY THE BOX
THEN WILL HE CAUSE PERFECTIONS OF THE KORAN TO BE MADE FOR HER AND HE WILL WATCH BY NIGHT AT HER TOMB
THEREUPON HE BROUGHT HER PAPER AND INK CASE AND A PEN OF BRASS AND BUSSED THE EARTH BEFORE HER FACE TO DO HER HONOUR
AND LET THINE ASSOCIATE BE ONE WHO SHALL DISSOCIATE THEE FROM THE WORLD
WHEN IT WAS THE FORTIETH NIGHT,[FN#97 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THEY TOLD THE GOVERNOR HE ROSE AND MOUNTED AND TAKING WITH HIM LABOURERS WITH SPADES AND BASKETS WENT ON MY TRACK WITH MANY PEOPLE BEHIND HIM
AND THE TWO RIDERS STAYED NOT THEIR HANDS FROM THE HUSTLE UNTIL CEASED THE CLAMOUR AND THE BUSTLE
FN#61 SUCH AN ACT OF GENEROSITY WOULD APPEAR TO EUROPEANS WELL NIGH INSANITY BUT IT IS QUITE IN ARAB MANNERS
FOR AL MU'IN HATH SET A SNARE FOR YOU BOTH
MOREOVER HE REIGNED SUPREME OVER THE NORTH COUNTRY AND DIYAR BAKR OR MESOPOTAMIA AND OVER SUDAN THE EASTERN NEGRO LAND AND THE ISLANDS OF THE OCEAN AND ALL THE FAR FAMED RIVERS OF THE EARTH SAYHUN AND JAYHUN,[FN#142 NILE AND EUPHRATES

AND WHEN I SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM I MOUNTED THE MULE AND CAME HITHER IN HASTE TO TELL YOU WHEN MY MASTER'S DAUGHTERS AND WIFE HEARD THIS THEY SCREAMED AND RENT THEIR RAIMENT AND BEAT THEIR FACES WHILST THE NEIGHBOURS CAME AROUND THEM
FOR I LONG TO SEE HER AND HEAR HER DISCOURSE
HAIL TO THE BEAUTY OF OUR CAMP THE PRIDE OF FOLK THE DEARLING WHO EN SLAVES ALL HEARTS BY HER BEHEST
AFTER AWHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE FULL TIDE SEA.--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
SO THEY MARCHED FOR THREE DAYS TILL ON THE FOURTH DAY THEY DREW NEAR TO BAGHDAD
AUTHOR OF THE CELEBRATED SAYING CONSULT THEM FEMININES AND DO CLEAR CONTRARY-WISE FN#265 OUR HONOUR AMONGST THIEVES FN#266 THE SIXTH SUCCESSOR OF MOHAMMED AND FOUNDER OF THE BANU UMAYYAH OR OMMIADES CALLED THE SONS OF THE LITTLE MOTHER FROM THEIR EPONYMUS A.H
AND HENCE THE SAYING CONCERNING ONE ABSOLUTELY INCONSISTENT ART THOU NOW TAMIN AND THEN KAYS FN#296 SURNAMED AL-SAKAFI GOVERNOR OF AL-YAMAN AND IRAK
BUT THE PIOUS MAN ZAT AL-DAWAHI LOOKED AT THEM AND SAID WHAT IS IT YE FEAR YE WHO HAVE VOWED YOURSELVES TO THE LORD AND TO WORKING HIS WILL
FN#192 AN IDEA EVIDENTLY DERIVED FROM THE AEOLIPYLA OLLA ANIMATORIA THE INVENTION OF HERO ALEXANDRINUS WHICH SHOWED THAT THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS COULD APPLY THE MOTIVE FORCE OF STEAM
RUTH FROM HIS LORD TO EVERY SLAVE IS DUE
WHEN KING OMAR HEARD THE STORY OF SHARRKAN ABRIZAH WAS EXALTED IN HIS EYES AND HE LONGED TO SEE HER AND QUESTION HER
AND THIS IS WORN BY MANY MEN BY NIGHT AS WELL AS BY DAY DOUBTLESS TO AVOID THE EVIL EYE
SAYYID SA'ID KNOWN AS THE IMAN OF MUSKAT USED TO ENCOURAGE THE PATRIARCHAL PRACTICE
RUBBED HIS FACE ON THEM LIKE A FAWNING DOG
AT THIS ZAU AL-MAKAN REJOICED SAYING OF A TRUTH THE BLESSING OF THE HOLY MAN HATH TAKEN EFFECT ON HIM AND SHARRKAN SAID PRAISED BE ALLAH FOR RECOVERY
SO THE CHAMBERLAIN BROUGHT HIM A STEED AND HE MOUNTED SURROUNDED BY THE MAMELUKES AND ALL THE COMPANY FROM THE TENTS ON FOOT TO DO HIM SERVICE AND HE RODE ON UNTIL HE CAME TO THE GREAT PAVILION WHERE HE SAT DOWN AND HE LAID THE ROYAL DAGGER ACROSS HIS THIGHS WHILST THE CHAMBERLAIN STOOD IN ATTENDANCE ON HIM AND HIS ARMED SLAVES STATIONED THEMSELVES UNDER THE ENTRANCE AWNING OF THE SHAHMIYANAH WITH DRAWN SWORDS IN THEIR HANDS
HE AND THOSE WITH HIM SO THAT EARTH QUAKED AS WITH AN EARTHQUAKE AND THE UNBELIEVER HOST BRAKE ASUNDER AND FLED INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND THE MOSLEMS FOLLOWED THEM WITH LUNGE AND BLOW
333 FN#222 MEANING AN ANGRY VIOLENT MAN
QUOTH ZAU AL-MAKAN I WONDER TO WHOM BELONG ALL THESE CHATTELS AND CAMELS AND STUFFS SO HE ASKED ONE OF THE EUNUCHS WHITHER THIS DISPATCHING AND HE ANSWERED THESE ARE PRESENTS SENT BY THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS TO KING OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN WITH THE TRIBUTE OF SYRIA NOW WHEN ZAU AL-MAKAN HEARD HIS FATHER'S NAME HIS EYES BRIMMED OVER WITH TEARS AND HE BEGAN REPEATING OH YE GONE FROM THE GAZE OF THESE RIDDED EYNE YE WHOSE SIGHT IN MY SPIRIT SHALL EVER DWELL
SHALL THE DRY ALL DRINK OF THY TANKS AND I UNDER RAIN-CLOUD THIRST FOR THE COOLING SHOWER O MY LORD CRIED HE THE LIKE WILL BEFAL EVERY ONE WHO LOVETH AND SERVETH THEE WELL BE QUICK WITH THEE QUOTH THE SULTAN AND TELL ME HOW THIS CAME TO PASS AND WHO DID THIS DEED BY ONE WHOSE HONOUR IS PART OF MY HONOUR QUOTH THE WAZIR KNOW O MY LORD THAT I WENT OUT THIS DAY TO THE SLAVE-MARKET TO BUY ME A COOKMAID WHEN I SAW THERE A DAMSEL NEVER IN MY LIFE LONG SAW I A FAIRER
ON MY HEAD BE IT THEREUPON SHE TUCKED UP HER SLEEVES AND WARMING SOME WATER WASHED HIS HANDS FEET AND BODY
SO IF THOU WOULDST HAVE THE KING GRANT THEE THY DESIRE GIVE ME INK CASE AND PAPER AND I WILL WRITE THEE A LETTER
AMONGST THE GREEKS A BODY REMAINING ENTIRE LONG AFTER DEATH SUGGESTS ANATHEMA MARANATHA
ACCORDING TO MY NATURE BIRTH BLOOD DE RACE
SO I RETRACED MY STEPS TEARFUL-EYED AND HEAVY HEARTED AND RETURNED HOME WHERE I FOUND THE DAUGHTER OF MY UNCLE SITTING WITH HER FACE TO THE WALL
SO I RUSHED ON THE CHIEF KNIGHT THEIR LEADER ALBEIT HE WAS A MATCH FOR A THOUSAND HORSE AND I SMOTE HIM TILL I SEVERED HEAD FROM TRUNK
THEY ADVANCED AND RETREATED
PRESENTLY THE YOUNG WOMAN GET BENEATH THE OLD WOMAN
GO DOWN TO THE PRISON AND FETCH HIM AND I WILL STRIKE OFF HIS HEAD TO HEAR IS TO OBEY REPLIED AL-MU'IN
SO THE SQUADRONS BROKE UP AND PUSHED FORWARD AND THE BATTALIONS AND COMPANIES FILED PAST IN BATTLE ARRAY TILL THE WHOLE ARMY WAS IN MOTION
AND I WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT TO DO A BIT OF FISHING SO HE TOOK HIS NET AND CAST IT BUT HE HAD HARDLY DONE SO WHEN BEHOLD THE CALIPH COME UP SINGLE-HANDED AND STANDING HARD BY KNEW HIM AND CALLED ALOUD TO HIM HO KARIM THE FISHERMAN HEARING HIMSELF NAMED TURNED ROUND AND SEEING THE CALIPH TREMBLED AND HIS SIDE-MUSCLES QUIVERED AS HE CRIED BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I DID IT NOT IN MOCKERY OF THE MANDATE
AND NONE COULD NEAR ME SO I BROUGHT HIS HEAD TO YOU THAT YOU MAY BE STRENGTHENED IN HOLY WAR AND WORK OUT WITH YOUR SWORDS THE WILL OF THE LORD OF THE FAITHFUL
SHE WAS WONT TO BRIBE THOSE WHO RUBBED PARTS WITH HER BY MEANS OF JEWELS AND INSTRUCTIONS
NOR DID I REACH MY HOME ERE THE NIGHT WAS FAR SPENT AND I FOUND THE DAUGHTER OF MY UNCLE SITTING IN TEARS
WHEN THE CALIPH HEARD THIS HE TURNED TO THE EUNUCHS AND SAID HERE WITH GHANIM TO ME SO JA'AFAR WENT TO FETCH HIM
OF MY RICHES I'VE NOTHING ON THEE TO BESTOW O FISHER EXCEPT THE FAIR GIFT THOU HAST SCANNED
IT WAS KING SHARRKAN SON OF KING OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN
WHEN ALL WAS QUIET AND HE FELT SURE THAT HE WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE PLACE HIS THOUGHT WAS BUSIED ABOUT WHAT THE CHEST CONTAINED AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF WOULD THAT I KNEW THE CONTENTS OF THAT BOX HOWEVER HE WAITED TILL DAY BROKE WHEN MORNING SHONE AND SHOWED HER SHEEN
SHALL WE MEET ONCE MORE IN JOY AND GLEE
TOMORROW WE SALLY FORTH TO FIGHT AGAINST CONSTANTINOPLE AND WE SHALL FIND NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT SAID THE WAZIR DANDAN AND I NO LESS DESIRE TO SEE THIS ASCETIC
YET THERE ARE VARIETIES OF CANNABIS SUCH AS THE DAKHA OF SOUTH AFRICA CAPABLE OF MOST VIOLENT EFFECT
THEN HE RUSHED UPON THE FOE'S RIGHT WING AND OF IT SLEW TWO KNIGHTS AND IN LIKE MANNER HE DEALT WITH THE LEFT WING
BUT AS BEFORE NOTED THE CUSTOM IS BY NO MEANS UNIVERSAL
101
SO THEY TURNED TAIL TO FLY WHILE THE BITING SABRE WROUGHT ITS HAVOC AND THE MOSLEMS SLEW OF THEM THAT DAY SOME FIFTY THOUSAND HORSE AND TOOK MORE THAN THAT NUMBER
NAY THOUGH I SHOULD ASK OF HIM A THOUSAND FAVOURS EVERY DAY HE WOULD COMPLY WHEN NUR AL-DIN HEARD THIS HE SAID GOOD
353 = 963 AS A BASE AGAINST THE ARABS BY THE EMPEROR PHOCAS THE ARAB
AND AT LAST THE FRANK SAID TO HIS MEN TOMORROW SHALL DECIDE THE MATTER SO THEY BOTH PASSED THAT NIGHT RESTFULLY TILL DAWN
AND WHO AFTER CARRYING OFF HER SLAVES AND QUEEN SOPHIA HAD RETURNED WITH THEM ALL TO HER NATIVE LAND

THEN SHE CALLED OUT TO HIM O MOSLEM COME ON AND LET US WRESTLE ERE THE BREAK OF MORNING AND TUCKED UP HER SLEEVES FROM A FOREARM LIKE FRESH CURD WHICH ILLUMINED THE WHOLE PLACE WITH ITS WHITENESS
BUT WHEN FOLK SAW HER ALL WONDERED AT HER BEAUTY AND EXCLAIMED BLESSED BE ALLAH THE MOST EXCELLENT CREATOR
AFTER A WHILE HIS SON TOOK THE LOADS AND BIDDING FAREWELL TO HIS MOTHER AND KINDRED AND TOWNSFOLK WENT FORTH WITH A COMPANY OF MERCHANTS PUTTING HIS TRUST IN ALLAH ALMIGHTY WHO DECREED HIM SAFETY SO THAT HE ARRIVED WITHOUT LET OR STAY AT BAGHDAD
HENCE ARDESHIR[FN#260 SAITH RELIGION AND KINGSHIP BE TWINS
THEN SAID ZAU AL-MAKAN KNOW YE WHO DID THIS DEED AND HOW IS IT I SEE NOT THE DEVOTEE HIM WHO THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD HATH PUT AWAY QUOTH THE WAZIR AND WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THIS AFFLICTION SAVE THAT DEVOTEE THAT SATAN

THE SUFIS EXPLAIN THIS THAUMATURGY BY ALLAH CHANGING SOMETHING OF NATURE'S ORDINARY COURSE IN FAVOUR OF AN ESPECIAL WORSHIPPER AND AFTER A FASHION THIS IS CATHOLIC DOCTRINE SEE DABISTAN III
WHEN IT WAS THE FIFTY-FIRST NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SHARRKAN BADE PRINCESS ABRIZAH AND HER DAMSELS DOFF THE GARB THAT WAS ON THEM AND DON THE GARMENTS OF DAUGHTERS OF GREECE
AND MY BREAST WAS BROADENED THEREBY FOR I KNEW NOT THE TRICKS OF PATE NOR THE CHANGING WAYS OF TIME
AND WHEN SHE LOOKED AT THE TOMB SHE WEPT AND THREW HERSELF ON IT
AND OF HIS GLADNESS HE WENT IN TO THE CHILD AND KISSED HIM BETWEEN THE EYES AND WONDERED AT HIS BRILLIANT LOVELINESS
BUT AS REGARDS THE OLD WOMAN SHE ALONE ABODE AWAKE WHILE THEY SLUMBERED IN THE TENT AND LOOKING AT SHARRKAN SHE PRESENTLY SAW THAT HE WAS DROWNED IN SLEEP
IF LIONS DRAGGED ME TO THEIR FOREST-LAIR SAFE SHOULD I LIVE TILL DRAW MY DEATH-DAY NIGH THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO PROCLAIM BEFORE NUR AL-DIN THIS IS THE LEAST OF THE RETRIBUTION FOR HIM WHO IMPOSETH UPON KINGS WITH FORGERIES AND THEY CEASED NOT PARADING HIM ROUND ABOUT BASSORAH TILL THEY MADE HIM STAND BENEATH THE PALACE-WINDOWS AND SET HIM UPON THE LEATHER OF BLOOD,[FN#74 AND THE SWORDER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID O MY LORD I AM BUT A SLAVE COMMANDED IN THIS MATTER
BUT AS SOON AS YE SEE THE STANDARD WITH THE WORDS THERE IS NO GOD BUT THE GOD AND MOHAMMED IS GOD'S APOSTLE ON WHOM BE SALUTATION AND SALVATION THEN UP WITH THE GREEN BANNER AND DO YOUR ENDEAVOUR AND FALL ON THEIR REAR AND SHOUT ALLA HO AKBAR

HIS WITS WERE DAZED AND HE SO LOST COMMAND OF HIS SENSES THAT HE COULD NOT STAND FIRM ON HIS FEET
SHE PLEASED HIM MUCH WHEREAT HE ASKED O HASAN WHAT IS BIDDEN FOR THIS GIRL AND HE ANSWERED FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DINARS TO OPEN THE DOOR OF SALE QUOTH AL-MU'IN FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IS MY BID WHEN THE MERCHANTS HEARD THIS THEY HELD BACK AND DARED NOT BID ANOTHER DIRHAM WOTTING WHAT THEY DID OF THE WAZIR'S TYRANNY VIOLENCE AND TREACHERY
THE CALIPH WAS PLEASED AND SAID O KARIM DOFF THY HABIT SO HE PUT OFF A GABERDINE OF COARSE WOOLLEN STUFF PATCHED IN AN HUNDRED PLACES WHEREON THE LICE WERE RAMPANT AND A TURBAND WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN UNTWISTED FOR THREE YEARS BUT TO WHICH HE HAD SOWN EVERY RAG HE CAME UPON

FN#157 THIS PRELIMINARY MOVE CALLED IN PERSIAN NAKL-I SAFAR IS GENERALLY MENTIONED
ON THE FORTY-FIRST DAY THERE CAME A PRESENT FROM THE CALIPH
SO I AROSE FROM MY SEAT AND WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND RAISING ITS COVER FOUND A DISH OF FOWLS SURROUNDED BY FOUR SAUCERS CONTAINING FOUR SEVERAL MEATS
FN#462 ALL PROPHETS HAD SOME MANUAL TRADE AND THAT OF DAVID WAS MAKING COATS OF MAIL WHICH HE INVENTED FOR BEFORE HIS DAY MEN USED PLATE-ARMOUR
AND MYRTLE AND GILLIFLOWER AND LAVENDER WITH THE BLOOD-RED ANEMONE FROM NU'UMAN HIGHT
HE ALIGHTED AND A TENT WAS PITCHED FOR HIM
HOW MANY MEN HATH SHE NOT SLAIN BEFORE THEE AND WHAT DEEDS HATH SHE NOT DONE
VI 21 THE DOUBLE SWEAR IS INTENDED TO BE VERY SERIOUS
HE WAS AMAZED AT HER ELOQUENT SPEECH AND THANKED HER FOR HER DEALING WITH HIS SON SHARRKAN AND BADE HER BE SEATED
THEN SHE UNDID HER PETTICOAT TROUSERS WHICH SLIPPED DOWN TO HER ANKLETS AND WE FELL TO CLASPING AND EMBRACING AND TOYING AND SPEAKING SOFTLY AND BITING AND INTER TWINING OF LEGS AND GOING ROUND ABOUT THE HOLY HOUSE AND THE CORNERS THEREOF,[FN#515 TILL HER JOINTS BECAME RELAXED FOR LOVE DELIGHT AND SHE SWOONED AWAY

JUVENAL SEEMS TO ALLUDE TO THE JEWISH SYNAGOGUE SIMILARLY USED
AND THE STREAMS RAN RINGING TO THE BIRDS GAY SINGING WHILE THE RUSTLING BREEZE UPSPRINGING ATTEMPERED THE AIR TO TEMPERANCE EXQUISITE
AS SOON AS THEY SAW ZAU AL-MAKAN THE RIDERS DISMOUNTED AND SALUTED HIM AND KISSED GROUND BETWEEN HIS HANDS WHEN HE SAID TO THEM REJOICE YE IN THE GLAD TIDINGS OF THE VICTORY OF THE MOSLEM AND THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE TRIBE OF UNBELIEVERS THEN THEY GAVE ONE ANOTHER JOY OF THEIR DELIVERANCE AND OF THE GREATNESS OF THEIR REWARD AFTER RESURRECTION DAY
BUT WHEN THE STOKER SAW HIMSELF BESET BY THE PAGES HE DESPAIRED OF HIS LIFE AND TURNING TO THE EUNUCH SAID TO HIM O CHIEF I AM NEITHER THIS YOUTH'S BROTHER NOR AM I AKIN TO HIM NOR IS HE SIB TO ME
SAY TO THE BLAMER BLAME ME NOT FOR I FROM LOVE OF HIM WILL NEVER TURN TO FLEE
FOR HER FATHER WAS DEAD AND BEFORE HIS DEATH HE HAD AGREED WITH MY FATHER THAT I SHOULD MARRY HER
FOR IF KING SHARRKAN COME FORTH AS A CHAMPION TO FIGHT SINGLE HANDED OUR MAN WILL SLAY HIM AND WILL SLAY THE OTHER MOSLEM KNIGHTS TILL NOT ONE IS LEFT
AND IT MAY BE ASSUMED AS A FORMULA ADDRESSEE TO FOREIGN POTENTATES BY A PROPHET WHO HAD BECOME VIRTUALLY KING OF ARABIA FN#146 THIS PRAYER BEFORE DOING THE DEED OF KIND IS I HAVE SAID MOSLEM AS WELL CHRISTIAN
WHEN IT WAS THE NINETY-SECOND NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE INFIDELS CALLED TO ONE ANOTHER SAYING TAKE WE VENGEANCE WREAK FOR LUKA WHILE HARDUB KING OF GREECE CRIED ALOUD HO TO OUR REVENGE FOR ABRIZAH THEREUPON KING ZAU AL-MAKAN SHOUTED HO SERVANTS OF THE REQUITING KING
SOMEWHAT LIKE A PAIR OF DARK SPECTACLES OR LOOKING AT THE SEA FROM A SANDY SHORE
IN THE NEXT TALE HE IS VICEROY OF DAMASCUS WHERE HE IS ALSO CALLED SULTAN FN#3 THE BULL EDIT
THEN THEY JOURNEYED AND CEASED NOT JOURNEYING FOR THREE DAYS TILL THEY ENTERED THE CITY OF DAMASCUS AND ALIGHTED AT THE SULTAN'S KHAN HARD BY THE VICEROY'S GATE
HER BREASTS WERE LIKE TWIN POMEGRANATES A WOVEN ZONE SET WITH ALL KINDS OF JEWELS TIGHTLY CLASPED HER WAIST WHICH EXPANDED BELOW INTO JUTTING HIPS
AND THE SWEAT STREAMED DOWN WHILST THE SCENTS OF MY DRESS WERE WAFTED ABROAD
THESE CONFESSED THEIR DEPENDENCE ON GOD AND WERE DISMISSED TO RETURN WHENCE THEY CAME FROM THIS FICTION IT APPEARS SAYS SALE THAT THE DOCTRINE OF PRE-EXISTENCE IS NOT UNKNOWN TO THE MOHAMMEDANS AND THERE IS SOME LITTLE CONFORMITY BETWEEN IT AND THE MODERN THEORY OF GENERATIO EX ANIMALCULIS IN SEMINE MARIUM
INDEED THOU PLEASEST THY FAMILY BUT THOU ANGEREST THY FATHER AND SHE WENT AWAY TRAILING HER SKIRTS.[FN#282 THE SON OF OMAR SAID I IMPLORED THE LORD TO SHOW ME MY FATHER ONE YEAR AFTER HIS DEATH TILL AT LAST I SAW HIM WIPING THE SWEAT FROM HIS BROW AND ASKED HIM HOW IS IT WITH THEE O MY FATHER HE ANSWERED BUT FOR MY LORD'S MERCY THY FATHER SURELY HAD PERISHED THEN SAID NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN HEAR O AUSPICIOUS KING THE SECOND DIVISION OF THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE INSTANCES OF THE FOLLOWERS OF THE APOSTLE AND OTHER HOLY MEN
A HIGH PERSONAGE ONCE ASKED ME IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE KILLED A MAN WHO CAUGHT HIM IN A STANDING POSITION

IT IS A SUNNAT OR PRACTICE OF THE PROPHET WHO SAID MAKE THE MID-DAY SIESTA FOR VERILY AT THIS HOUR THE DEVILS SLEEP NOT AYLULAIN IS SLUMBERING AFTER MORNING PRAYERS OUR BEAUTY-SLEEP CAUSING HEAVINESS ANDID LENESS
THEN THEY TALKED TOGETHER A LONG WHILE AND INDEED BOTH WERE DROWNED IN THE SEA OF THEIR MUTUAL LOVE
SO HARDUB ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THE CUNNING DOINGS OF HIS MOTHER ZAT AL-DAWAHI HOW SHE HAD SLAIN THE MOSLEM KING AND RECOVERED FROM HIM QUEEN SOPHIA AND HAD SAID THE MOSLEMS HAVE ASSEMBLED THEIR FORCES AND ARE ON THEIR WAY TO ATTACK US WHEREFORE IT BEHOVETH THAT WE TWO JOIN HANDS IN SINGLE BAND AND MEET THEM NOW KING AFRIDUN REJOICED IN THE RETURN OF HIS DAUGHTER AND THE KILLING OF KING OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN

SO I CARRIED THEE HOME WITH ME
AND SO SHE ABODE FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
I WAS CHARMED WITH THE PLACE AND I JOYED WITH EXCEEDING JOY ALBEIT I FOUND NOT THERE A LIVING SOUL AND MY GRIEF AND ANXIETY CEASED FROM ME.--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
NOW WHEN ALL THINGS NEEDFUL FOR THE BRIDE WERE READY THE KING CAUSED THE TENTS TO BE CARRIED OUT AND THEY PITCHED THE CAMP WITHIN SIGHT OF THE CITY WHERE THEY PACKED THE BRIDE'S STUFFS IN CHESTS AND GET READY THE GREEK HANDMAIDS AND TURKISH SLAVE GIRLS AND PROVIDED THE PRINCESS WITH GREAT STORE OF PRECIOUS TREASURES AND COSTLY JEWELS
WHAT MAKES THY MEMORY LIGHT SUCH BURNINGS IN MY HEART
BY ALLAH AN THOU HOLD NOT THY PEACE I WILL BEAT THEE TO DEATH O THOU TOWN FILTH WHEN SHE HEARD THIS SHE LOATHED LIFE AND LONGED FOR DEATH
BUT HE HELD OFF FROM HER IN AWE OF THE CALIPH
THENCE THEY PASSED WITH HIM INTO A TALL AND SPACIOUS HALL AT THE UPPER END OF WHICH WAS A WIDE DAIS CARPETED WITH ALL KINDS OF SILKS AND ROUND IT OPEN LATTICES COMMANDING A VIEW OF TREES AND STREAMS
THE TWO-HUMPED CAMEL IS NEVER SEEN IN ARABIA EXCEPT WITH NORTHERN CARAVANS AND TO SPEAK OF IT WOULD BE A SORE TEST OF BADAWI CREDULITY

THEN HE CRIED OUT AT THE EXECUTIONER AND BADE HIM STRIKE OFF NUR AL-DIN'S HEAD
WHEN ACCESS TO ME A GOOD CHAMBERLAIN FAND
AND AFTER LEARNING THIS MUCH I WILL ASK HIS LEAVE FOR THEE TO VISIT HIM
BUT AS REGARDS THE MAMELUKES THEY WENT TO NUR AL-DIN'S MANSION AND BREAKING OPEN THE DOORS ENTERED AND SEARCHED THE WHOLE PLACE BUT COULD FIND NO TRACE OF HIM AND THE DAMSEL
AND SHE HAD THRUST THE SKIRT OF HER SHIFT INTO HER TROUSERS STRING BEING BUSY WITH SOME HOUSEHOLD BUSINESS
AND AS SOON AS IT WAS DAWN THE TWO ARMIES DREW OUT WITH THE SWART OF SPEAR AND THE BLANCH OF BLADE
HALFAH OF WHICH THE HOME PUBLIC HAS OF LATE HEARD PERHAPS A TRIFLE TOO MUCH
MILE STRABO XI MAKES IT RANGE FROM 40 TO 60 STADES EACH=606 FEET 9 INCHES AND EVEN NOW IT VARIES BETWEEN 1,500 TO 6,000 YARDS
CARE AND CARK CEASED FROM HIM AND HE TURNED TO THE WAZIR AND SAID KNOW THOU O MINISTER THAT NONE SHALL FARE ABOUT THIS AFFAIR SAVE THOU BY REASON OF THY CONSUMMATE INTELLIGENCE AND GOOD BREEDING
THEY WERE LIKE A FLIGHT OF LOCUSTS OR RAIN CLOUDS RAINING RAIN AND THE VOICES OF THE MOSLEMS CHANTING THE KORAN AND GLORIFYING THE COMPASSIONATE ONE STRUCK THEIR EARS

AND TEARS RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS AND SHE REPEATED THESE CINQUAINS WHO SAITH THAT LOVE AT FIRST OF FREE WILL CAME SAY HIM
SO DO ME ONE LAST FAVOUR BY ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE LANDS OF AL-ISLAM

FURTHERMORE IF THY BROTHER ALSO HAVE A MIND TO GO WITH US WE WILL TAKE HIM BUT NONE ELSE
FOR THE ENVOYS WHO CAME WITH US ARE GONE TO INFORM THE KING OF OUR APPROACH AND HAPLY HE WILL HASTEN TO FALL ON US AND TAKE US PRISONERS SO SHARRKAN CRIED TO HIS MEN TO SADDLE AND MOUNT WHICH THEY DID AND SETTING OUT AT ONCE THEY STINTED NOT FARING TILL THEY REACHED THE SOLE OF THE VALLEY WHEREIN THE HOST LAY
XXVII TORRENS IN HIS NOTES CITES DRAYTON'S MOON-CALF BRING FORTH THE BIRTH-STOOL--NO LET IT ALONE
THEN HE CARRIED HIM TO HIS PALACE AND ASKED HIM WHERE LEAVEDST THOU THE WAZIR
AND AFTER THIS SHE RAISED HER HANDS AND HOLDING THE MIRROR OUTSIDE THE WICKET SHE TOOK THE RED KERCHIEF AND RETIRED INTO THE ROOM WITH IT BUT PRESENTLY RETURNED AND PUTTING OUT HER HAND WITH THE KERCHIEF LET IT DOWN TOWARDS THE LANE THREE SEVERAL TIMES DIPPING IT AND RAISING IT AS OFTEN
FM#472 THE LYNX WAS USED LIKE THE LION IN ANCIENT EGYPT AND THE CHITA-LEOPARD IN INDIA
THE GATE WAS ARCHED LIKE A GREAT HALL AND OVER WALLS AND ROOF RAMPED VINES WITH GRAPES OF MANY COLOURS
BUT WHEN HE SAW HER SHE PLEASED HIM AND HE SAID TO HIS SON TAKE HER
BUT HE WAS DROWNED IN THE SEA OF THOUGHT SAYING IN HIMSELF PRAISE BE TO HIM WHO FASHIONED HER FROM DIRTY WATER!"[FN#172 THEN HE GIRT HIMSELF AND MADE READY FOR WRESTLING AND SAID TO HER CROSS THE STREAM TO ME BUT SHE REPLIED IT IS NOT FOR ME TO COME OVER TO THEE

BUT SHE WOULD RELATE TO ME BY WAY OF CONSOLATION STORIES OF LOVE AND LOVERS EVERY NIGHT TILL I FELL ASLEEP
NOW ALL THIS OCCURRED WHILST THE BROTHER ZAU AL-MAKAN STILL TARRIED WITH THE FIREMAN AT DAMASCUS

AND FURTHERMORE ALLAH HATH BLESSED ME WITH TWO CHILDREN BY THEE A SON AND A DAUGHTER HER REPLY PLEASED THE KING AND AFTER LEAVING HER HE SET APART FOR HER AND HER CHILDREN A WONDROUS FINE PALACE
LITERALLY AN ARMOUR-BEARER CHOSEN FOR VELOUR AND TRUSTWORTHINESS
QUOTH I HEART BEAR THIS LOSS IN PATIENCE PATIENCE CRIED TAKE HEED
WHEN IT WAS THE SEVENTIETH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT KING OMAR SON OF AL-NU'UMAN SAID IN HIS LETTER AND SEND TO US THE DAMSEL TO THE END THAT SHE MAY DISPUTE WITH THEM BEFORE THE DOCTORS AND IF SHE PREVAIL OVER THEM I WILL RETURN HER TO THEE ACCOMPANIED WITH THE TRIBUTE OF BAGHDAD AS SOON AS SHARRKAN KNEW THE CONTENTS HE WENT IN TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW AND SAID TO HIM BRING THE DAMSEL TO WHOM I MARRIED THEE AND WHEN SHE CAME HE SHOWED HER THE LETTER AND SAID O MY SISTER

AS SOON AS HE HAD ENDED HIS TALE THE WAZIR SENT FOR THE EMIRS AND WAZIRS AND CHIEF OFFICERS AND ACQUAINTED THEM WITH THE MATTER
WHEN IT WAS MORNING THE CALIPH GAVE ORDERS TO RECORD THE HISTORY OF WHAT HAD BEFALLEN GHANIM FROM FIRST TO LAST AND TO DEPOSIT IT IN THE ROYAL MUNIMENT ROOMS THAT THOSE WHO CAME AFTER HIM MIGHT READ IT AND MARVEL AT THE DEALINGS OF DESTINY AND PUT THEIR TRUST IN HIM WHO CREATED THE NIGHT AND THE DAY

BUT AFTER REST NEITHER REPROACH NOR BLAME FEAR YE SO THE MONK RETURNED AND HE REJOICING TO KING AFRIDUN AND KING HARDUB AND TOLD THEM BOTH WHAT SHARRKAN HAD SAID WHEREAT KING AFRIDUN WAS GLAD WITH EXCEEDING GLADNESS AND FELL FROM HIM ANXIETY AND SADNESS AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF NO DOUBT BUT THIS SHARRKAN IS THEIR DOUGHTIEST SWAYER OF THE SWORD AND THE DOUREST AT LUNGE OF LANCE
HE FOULLY LIES WHO SAYS ALL LOVELINESS BELONGED TO JOSEPH IN THY LOVELINESS IS MANY A JOE
FN#225 HE COMPARES HER GLANCE WITH THE BLADE OF A YAMANI SWORD A LIEU COMMUN OF EASTERN POETRY
AND HE REJOINED I AM INDEED HEREUPON A SWOON CAME UPON HER
NOT ONE OF THEM WAS SAVED AND NOW THERE IS NAUGHT LEFT OF HOUSE OR HOUSEHOLD NOR EVEN A SIGN OF THEM
ALAS WHICH BY THE BY NO ONE EVER SAYS
FOR HE WAS AS A VULTURE BALD AND SCALD AND A WALL TREMBLING TO ITS FALL
THERE UPON THE CHAMBERLAIN MOUNTED HE AND HIS MEN TRUSTING THEE ALLAH WOULD HELP THEM TO VICTORY
QUOTH THE MESSENGER I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE RODE ON IN HASTE TO THAT CITY AND AS HE WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THEREIN IT SO CHANCED THAT THE KING WHO WAS SITTING IN ONE OF HIS PLEASAUNCES BEFORE THE CITY GATE ESPIED HIM AS HE WAS PASSING THE DOORS AND KNOWING HIM FOR A STRANGER BADE BRING HIM BEFORE THE PRESENCE
NOW THE OLD HAG WAS LEAN BODIED AND HOLLOW EYED AND SHE BOUND HER LEGS TIGHTLY ROUND WITH CORDS[FN#412 JUST ABOVE HER FEET TILL SHE DREW NEAR THE MOSLEM CAMP WHEN SHE UNWOUND THEM LEAVING THEIR MARKS DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN HER ANKLES
HIS BREAST WAS BROADENED AND LIGHTENED
FN#443 THAT IS FATAL TO THE SCOFFER AND THE IMPIOUS
EVEN AS SAID THE POET TIME HATH SHATTERED ALL MY FRAME OH
THE VISITOR KISSED NUR AL-DIN'S HAND AND SAID TO HIM O MY LORD HE WHO HATH LEFT THE LIKE OF THEE IS NOT DEAD
NOW IT SO HAPPENED THAT ZAU AL-MAKAN AND HIS FRIEND THE FIREMAN HAD COME FORTH FROM THE HUT IN WHICH THEY WERE TO SEE THE SPECTACLE AND THEY BEHELD CAMELS AND BUKHTI[FN#303 DROMEDARIES AND BAT-MULES AND TORCHES AND LANTERNS ALIGHT

AND THOU O MIGHTY KING SHALT BE UNDER THE STANDARDS AND THE ENSIGNS FOR THAT THOU ART THE PILLAR OF OUR DEFENCE
WHAT POSSIBLE ANSWER CAN I MAKE TO HIM THEN SHE CALLED AN OLD WOMAN WHO WAS ABOUT HER AND DISCOVERED HER SECRET TO HER SAYING HOW SHALL I ACT SEEING THAT KUT AL-KULUB DIED BY SUCH UNTIMELY DEATH O MY LADY QUOTH THE OLD CRONE THE TIME OF THE CALIPH'S RETURN IS NEAR

AND THE MINISTER DANDAN SAID BY ALLAH MY HEART SHRANK FROM HER QUOTH THE SULTAN HOW COULD THIS WHORE PLAY HER TRICKS UPON US TWICE
MOREOVER HE ORDERED THE KITCHENERS TO COOK RICH VIANDS AND SERVE THEM AND HE COMMANDED THE WATER CARRIERS TO DISPOSE THE WATER TROUGHS

BUT I DESIRE THEE TAKE CHARGE OF THIS CHEST AND DELIVER IT TO ME IN THE HARIM OF THE PRINCE OF THE FAITHFUL HEARING AND OBEDIENCE SAID JA'AFAR AND BADE HIS MEN BEAR IT AWAY TO THE HEAD QUARTERS OF THE CALIPHATE TOGETHER WITH KUT AL-KULUB COMMANDING THEM TO ENTREAT HER WITH HONOUR AS ONE IN HIGH ESTEEM
AND AS THE BIER WENT FORTH FROM THE HOUSE SOME ONE IN THE CROWD OF MOURNERS BEGAN TO CHANT THESE LINES ON THE FIFTH DAY I QUITTED AL MY FRIENDS FOR EVERMORE AND THEY LAID ME OUT AND WASHED ME ON A SLAB WITHOUT MY DOOR:[FN#22 THEY STRIPPED ME OF THE CLOTHES I WAS EVER WONT TO WEAR AND THEY CLOTHED ME IN THE CLOTHES WHICH TILL THEN I NEVER WORE

HE CRAVE HIS CHARGER BETWEEN THE TWO HOSTS IN LINE WHILST THE HORSEMEN ALL FIXED ON HIM THEIR EYNE AND HE CRIED OUT TO AFRIDUN WOE TO THEE O ACCURSED

THEY CEASED NOT TO FARE ON FOR THE SPACE OF A MONTH AND EACH BODY DISMOUNTED AT ITS OWN GROUND AND THERE RESTED EVERY WEEK THREE DAYS FOR THE HOST WAS GREAT
THE CRAVEN TURNED TAIL AND FLED
BUT HE HAD RISEN IN THE WORLD AND THE SULTAN HAD ADVANCED HIM TO BE ONE OF HIS CHAMBERLAINS

THIS IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST AND MOST POETICAL CHAPTERS OF THE BOOK
AFTER WHICH THE TABLES WERE REMOVED AND THOSE WHO WERE IN THE ASSEMBLY WITHDREW LEAVING ONLY THE CHIEF OFFICERS
AND WHEN THE TIRE WOMAN HAD DONE WASHING HER SHE DRESSED HER AND LED HER OUT OF THE BATH AND SEATED HER ON THE BENCH

WHEN SHE REACHED THE HOUSE SHE WENT IN AND SALUTED THE SYNDIC'S WIFE WHO ROSE AND KISSED THE GROUND BETWEEN HER HANDS FOR SHE KNEW HER
LIBERAL IS ALLAH'S FRIEND AYE THOUGH HE BE A SINNER
WHEN THEY ENTERED THAT HERMITAGE THE MONK MATRUHINA TOLD THEM OF ME AND THE KNIGHT SAID BRING HIM OUT FOR SURELY THERE IS NOT ON HIM A BIRD'S MEAL OF MEAT SO THEY OPENED THE DOOR OF THE DARK ROOM AND FOUND ME STANDING IN THE NICHE PRAYING AND RECITING THE KORAN AND GLORIFYING ALLAH AND HUMBLING MYSELF BEFORE THE ALMIGHTY

FN#313 THE IDEA IS ESSENTIALLY EASTERN A LION AT HOME AND A LAMB ABROAD IS THE POPULAR SAYING
GENERALLY HOWEVER MOSLEMS PREFER THE OLD CLASSICAL GREEK LETTERS THE TRIBULUM OF VIRGIL AND VARRO A SLIPPER-SHAPED SLED OF WOOD GARNISHED ON THE SOLE WITH LARGE-HEADED IRON NAILS OR SHARP FRAGMENTS OF FLINT OR BASALT
AND LIKE THE TENDRIL'D VINE THEY LOOSE THE RICH PROFUSION OF THEIR HAIR
WHY DOST THOU SAY THAT SHE IS NOBLE,[FN#249 WHILE SHE IS OF THE SCUM OF SLAVE GIRLS AND OF THE REFUSE OF FOLK

THEN QUOTH KING ZAU AL-MAKAN TO THE MINISTER DANDAN INFORM ME CONCERNING MY SIRE'S TREASURES AND HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND GAVE HIM TO KNOW OF THE LATE KING'S HOARDS AND MONIES AND WHAT WAS IN THE TREASURY OF AMASSED WEALTH AND JEWELS AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH OTHER PRECIOUS THINGS
THEREUPON SHARRKAN WENT OUT TO HER AND SAID THE KING CALLETH FOR THEE SHE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HER AND BROUGHT HER IN TO HIS FATHER WHO WAS SEATED ON HIS THRONE AND WHO HAVING DISMISSED HIS HIGH OFFICERS WAS ATTENDED ONLY BY HIS EUNUCHS
WILL THEY NOT COME OUT AGAINST ME TEN BY TEN THAT WOULD BE VILLAINY SAID SHE
HE CAME UP TO ME AND SAID
SO AT LAST WE LIFTED UP THE DOOR;[FN#375 AND GOING IN FOUND HIM DEAD WITH HIS FLESH TORN INTO STRIPS AND BITS AND HIS BONES BROKEN.[FN#376 WHEN WE SAW HIM IN THIS CONDITION IT WAS GRIEVOUS TO US AND WE TOOK UP THE CUP AND FOUND WITHIN ITS COVER A PIECE OF PAPER WHEREON WAS INSCRIBED WHOSO DOETH EVIL LEAVETH NO REGRETS AND THIS BE THE REWARD OF HIM WHO PLAYETH TRAITOR WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF KINGS AND WHO DEBAUCHETH THEM
THEN THEY SALLIED OUT TILL THEY WERE HARD UPON THE UNBELIEVERS AND WHEN THESE SAW THEM FROM AFAR THEY CRIED OUT TO THEM SAYING O MOSLEMS WE HAVE TAKEN CAPTIVES YOUR SULTAN AND YOUR WAZIR WHO HATH THE ORDERING OF YOUR AFFAIRS
FN#169 ARAB HORSES ARE NEVER TAUGHT TO LEAP SO SHE WAS QUITE SAFE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A BROOK NINE FEET BROAD
SOME DAYS AFTER THIS IT HAPPENED BY DECREE OF DESTINY THAT THE DAMSEL REPAIRED TO THE BATHS IN THE HOUSE WHERE SOME OF THE SLAVE WOMEN BATHED HER
SO ALLAH SOFTENED THE IRON FOR HIM AND IN HIS HANDS IT BECAME LIKE WAX KORAN XXI
BUT MY NAME AT THIS PRESENT IS GHUSSAT[FN#252 AL-ZAMAN THE DESPIGHT OF THE AGE WHEN THE MERCHANT HEARD THIS HIS EYES BRIMMED OVER WITH TEARS AND QUOTH HE TO HER HAST THOU NOT A SICK BROTHER AY BY ALLAH O MY LORD I HAVE QUOTH SHE BUT FORTUNE HATH PARTED ME AND HIM AND HE LIETH SICK IN JERUSALEM THE MERCHANT'S HEAD WAS CONFOUNDED AT THE SWEETNESS OF HER SPEECH AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF VERILY THE BADAWI SPAKE THE TRUTH OF HER THEN SHE CALLED TO MIND HER BROTHER AND HIS SICKNESS AND HIS STRANGERHOOD AND HER SEPARATION FROM HIM IN HIS HOUR OF WEAKNESS AND HER NOT KNOWING WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM
WHEREUPON THE TEARS STREAMED FROM HER EYES AND SHE REPLIED IF HE OF PATIENCE FAIL THE TRUTH TO HIDE FOR HIM NO CURE SAVE DEATH MY VISION VIEW'TH I COMMITTED THEM TO MEMORY AND RETURNED HOME AND WHEN I WENT IN TO MY COUSIN I FOUND HER FALLEN INTO A FIT AND MY MOTHER SITTING AT HER HEAD
THAT THE MINGLED SEED OF THE TWO CHAPS
AND INCREDIBLE TO RELATE THIS IS STILL PRACTICED AFTER A FASHION BY THE PARSIS ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE AND THE SHARPEST WITTED OF ASIATIC RACES
THEREUPON THE MOSLEMS DREW TOGETHER AND PASSED THE NIGHT IN CONGRATULATIONS AND WHEN MORNING DAWNED AND DAYBREAK SHONE WITH ITS SHINE AND SHEEN THEY SAW BAHRAM THE CAPTAIN OF THE DAYLAMITES AND RUSTAM THE CAPTAIN OF THE TURKS ADVANCING TO JOIN THEM WITH TWENTY THOUSAND CAVALIERS LIKE LIONS GRIM
WHEN SHE HEARD HIM SHE WEPT AND MADE NO ANSWER
THE ASSEMBLIES OF AL-HARIRI
HE BLESSED HER AND THE TWO SAT TALKING AWHILE TILL SHE ASKED HIM KNOWEST THOU AUGHT TOUCHING LOVERS AND SLAVES OF LOVE
WHEN THE CALIPH'S MESSENGER CAME WITH THE MONEY HE WENT IN TO THE IMAM AND ACCOSTED HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT SPEAK TO HIM
THEN HE SET OUT THREE MONTHS AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE ARMY OF SYRIA AND AS SOON AS THE ARABS WERE COME IN AND THE TROOPS WERE ASSEMBLED FROM ALL DIRECTIONS
BUT A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THE TURKISH SOLDIERS MUTINIED ABOUT ARREARS OF PAY OFTEN DELAYED FOR YEARS THE GOVERNING PASHA WOULD SET FIRE TO THE TOWN AND ALLOW THE MEN TO LOOT WHAT THEY PLEASED DURING A STATED TIME
SO THE CALIPH LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID I WONDER HOW THEY CAME HITHER AND WHO ADMITTED THEM INTO MY PAVILION
AND KNOW O KING THAT ABD AL-MALIK BIN MARWAN WROTE TO HIS BROTHER ABD AL-AZIZ WHEN HE DESPATCHED HIM TO EGYPT AS FOLLOWS PAY HEED TO THY SECRETARIES AND THY CHAMBERLAINS FOR THE SECRETARIES WILL ACQUAINT THEE WITH ESTATE FISHED MATTERS AND THE CHAMBERLAINS WITH MATTERS OF OFFICIAL CEREMONY WHILST THINE EXPENDITURE WILL MAKE THY TROOPS KNOWN TO THEE OMAR BIN AL-KHATTAB[FN#263 WHOM ALLAH ACCEPT WHEN ENGAGING A SERVANT WAS IN THE HABIT OF CONDITIONING HIM WITH FOUR CONDITIONS
SAID SUFYAN ON THE DAY OF RESURRECTION HE SHALL COME WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE KORAN AND THEY WILL BE DISTINGUISHED BY INCREASE OF HONOUR FROM THEIR FELLOWS QUOTH SUFYAN WERE THE SOUL ESTABLISHED IN THE HEART AS BEFITTETH IT WOULD FLY AWAY FOR JOY AND PINING FOR PARADISE AND FOR GRIEF AND FEAR OF HELL-FIRE IT IS RELATED ALSO OF SUFYAN AL-THAURI THAT HE SAID TO LOOK UPON THE FACE OF A TYRANT IS A SIN THEN THE THIRD DAMSEL RETIRED AND CAME FOR WARD THE FOURTH WHO SAID HERE AM I TO TREAT OF SUNDRY TRADITIONS OF PIOUS MEN WHICH SUGGEST THEMSELVES TO ME
AND GOING HOME FOUND MY COUSIN GROANING AND VERSIFYING WITH THESE COUPLETS A WASTED BODY HEART ENPIERCED TO CORE AND TEARS THAT DOWN MY POOR CHEEKS POUR AND POUR
ALL THINGS WERE EASY SAVE TO PART FROM THEE FOR MY SAD HEART THIS GRIEF IS HARD TO DREE WHEN THE MERCHANT HEARD HER VERSES HE WEPT AND PUT OUT HIS HAND TO WIPE AWAY THE TEARS FROM HER CHEEKS
MEANWHILE HIS SON SHARRKAN WAS MAKING HIMSELF RENOWNED IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE WORLD AND HIS FATHER WAS PROUD OF HIM AND HIS MIGHT WAXED AND GREW MIGHTIER
AND THE CAUSE THEREOF IS AS FOLLOWS
THEN THEY DREW APART AND SHARRKAN MUSTERED HIS MEN AND FOUND NONE WOUNDED SAVE FOUR ONLY WHO SHOWED HURTS BUT NOT DEATH HURTS
O AZIZ SAID SHE WE HAVE IN THIS HOUSE FLOUR GRAIN FRUITS AND POMEGRANATES
THEY ASKED AND ANSWERED I SWEET IS THE TASTE BUT AH
BUT FORGET NOT MY CHARGE THEN SHE WEPT AND MY HEART WAS PAINED FOR HER BY REASON OF HER OVER MUCH WEEPING AND I ASKED WHAT IS THE CHARGE THOU GAYEST ME SHE ANSWERED WHEN THOU TAKEST LEAVE OF HER REPEAT TO HER THE VERSE BEFORE MENTIONED SO FULL OF JOY I LEFT HER AND REPAIRING TO THE GARDEN WENT UP INTO THE PAVILION WHERE BEING SATIATED WITH FOOD I SAT DOWN AND WATCHED TILL A FOURTH PART OF THE DARK HOURS WAS PAST
THE HONORATIOREN AMONGST WILD PEOPLE WOULD SCORN SUCH FOUL PLAY
FN#94 AGHA TURK.=SIR GENTLEMAN IS I HAVE SAID POLITELY ADDRESSED TO A EUNUCH
AND HE SEEING THE STOKER WASHING AND RUBBING HIM SAID THIS IS DOING INJURY TO THE KEEPER'S RIGHTS REPLIED THE FIREMAN THE MASTER OVERWHELMETH US WITH HIS FAVOURS THEN THE BATHMAN PROCEEDED TO SHAVE ZAU AL-MAKAN'S HEAD AFTER WHICH HE AND THE STOKER WASHED THEMSELVES AND RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE HE CLAD ZAU AL-MAKAN IN A SHIRT OF FINE STUFF AND A ROBE OF HIS OWN
WHEN THEY DREW NEAR SUDDENLY APPEARED UNDER IT A NUMEROUS CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE FULL TIDE SEA WITH FLAGS AND STANDARDS DRUMS AND KETTLEDRUMS HORSEMEN AND FOOTMEN
SO SHE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND SAID WOE'S ME
THEN SHARRKAN TOOK HIS DAUGHTER KUZIA FAKAN AND COMMITTED HER TO THE CHARGE OF THE WET NURSES AND THE EUNUCHS AND HE MADE READY THE TRIBUTE IN HASTE BIDDING THE CHAMBERLAIN TRAVEL WITH THE PRINCESS AND THE TREASURE TO BAGHDAD
AND HE ANSWERED IF THOU CRUCIFY US ALL TOGETHER WE SHALL KEEP ONE ANOTHER COMPANY THE CALIPH LAUGHED AT HIS SPEECH
IN HEB
AND SETTING OUT WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE GUARDS AND A WORLD OF PEOPLE REPAIRED TO GHANIM'S HOUSE
VERILY QUOTH THE APOSTLE OF ALLAH WHOM ALLAH BLESS AND PRESERVE WHOSO EASETH THE TROUBLED OF ONE OF THE TROUBLES OF THIS TROUBLOUS WORLD ALLAH WILL EASE HIM OF AN HUNDRED TROUBLES
BUT ART THOU INCLINED TO HIM AS HE TO THEE HE THEN KEPT SILENCE AWAITING A REPLY
SO HE HIRED A MAN WITH A MULE AND BRINGING HIM TO THE TOMB LIFTED THE CHEST WHEREIN HE HAD PUT THE DAMSEL AND SET IT ON THE MULE
AND DRAWING ME ON TO HER BREAST HEAVED A SIGH AND FOLLOWED IT UP WITH A WRIGGLE BY WAY OF BEING COY
WHEREFORE THOU ART IN MY WARD AND UNDER MY SAFEGUARD
FOR HE IS BENT UPON GOING TO DAMASCUS OF SYRIA AND BY ALLAH IT IS HARD TO ME TO PART WITH HIM AND I FEAR FOR HIM FROM HIGHWAY MEN REPLIED SHE I WILL GO WITH YOU BOTH AND HE REJOINED PRAISED BE ALLAH FOR ACCORD AND WE HAVE SAID THE LAST WORD THEN HE ROSE AND SELLING ALL HIS OWN GOODS AND HIS WIFE'S GEAR,--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE FIFTY-FIFTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE FIRE MAN AND HIS WIFE AGREED WITH ZAU AL-MAKAN TO TRAVEL WITH HIM DAMASCUS WARDS
THEN THE WAZIR WENT TO THE SULTAN AND REPORTED ALL TO HIM AND ZAU AL-MAKAN WAITED UNTIL NIGHTFALL WHEN HE WENT IN TO HIS SISTER NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN AND ASKED HER DOST THOU KNOW THE CAUSE OF MY FATHER'S MURDER OR NOT I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAUSE SHE ANSWERED AND DREW A SILKEN CURTAIN BEFORE HERSELF WHILST ZAU AL-MAKAN SEATED HIMSELF WITHOUT THE CURTAIN AND COMMANDED THE WAZIR TO THE PRESENCE AND WHEN HE CAME SAID TO HIM I DESIRE THOU RELATE TO ME IN DETAIL THE CAUSE OF THE KILLING OF MY SIRE KING OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN KNOW THEN O KING REPLIED DANDAN THAT KING OMAR BIN AL NU'UMAN WHEN HE RETURNED TO BAGHDAD FROM HIS CHASING AND HUNTING AND ENTERED THE CITY ENQUIRED FOR THEE AND THY SISTER BUT COULD NOT FIND YOU AND KNEW THAT YOU TWAIN HAD GONE ON THE PILGRIMAGE
BUT AS REGARDS KING ZAU AL-MAKAN AND HIS BROTHER SHARRKAN AND THE WAZIR DANDAN AND THE ESCORT WHEN THEY REACHED THE HERMITAGE THEY ENTERED AND MET THE MONK MATRUHINA WHO CAME OUT TO SEE WHO AND WHAT THEY WERE
ALL THIS WHILE HIS SON SHARRKAN KNEW NOT THAT A MALE CHILD HAD BEEN BORN TO HIS FATHER OMAR SON OF AL-NU'UMAN HAVING NEWS ONLY THAT HE HAD BEEN BLESSED WITH THE BIRTH OF NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN
YET O AUSPICIOUS KING THIS STORY TO WHICH THOU HAST DEIGNED GIVE EAR IS ON NO WISE MORE WONDROUS THAN THE TALE OF KING OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN AND HIS SONS SHARRKAN AND ZAU AL-MAKAN AND WHAT BEFEL THEM OF THINGS SELD-SEEN AND PEREGRINE.[FN#138 THE KING ASKED HER AND WHAT WAS THEIR STORY AND SHE ANSWERED
I WILL NOT GAINSAY THEE IN AUGHT
AND HE FORGOT ARMY AND WAZIR AS HE GAZED ON HER FAIR HEAD DECKED AND DIGHT WITH A NET WORK OF PEARLS SET OFF BY DIVERS SORTS OF GEMS
SO THE TROOPS PUSHED FORWARD BUT FOUND NONE ON THE RAMPARTS WHEREAT THEY MARVELLED WHILE ZAU AL-MAKAN WAS TROUBLED AT THE CASE FOR HE DEEPLY MOURNED THE SEVERANCE FROM HIS BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HE WAS SORE PERTURBED ABOUT THAT TRAITOR THE ASCETIC

INDEED THERE IS RESERVED FOR THEM A GRIEVOUS PENALTY AND HE SAID[FN#338 ON WHOM BE SALVATION AND SALUTATION WORKS ARE ACCORDING TO INTENTION AND TO EACH MAN IS ATTRIBUTED THAT WHICH HE INTENDETH HE SAID ALSO IN THE BODY IS A PART WHICH BEING SOUND THE REST IS SOUND AND WHICH BEING UNSOUND THE WHOLE IS UNSOUND AND THIS IS THE HEART
FN#479 A VERY FAR FETCHED ALLUSION
TAJ AL-MULUK ASKED HIM WHY DIDST THOU NOT SHOW US THY MERCHANDISE END HE ANSWERED O MY LORD THERE IS NAUGHT AMONG MY STOCK WORTHY OF THINE AUGUST HIGHNESS QUOTH THE PRINCE NEEDS MUST THOU SHOW ME WHAT THOU HAST AND ACQUAINT ME WITH THY CIRCUMSTANCE

FN#256 THE THIRD OF THE FOUR GREAT MOSLEM SCHOOLS OF THEOLOGY TAKING ITS NAME FROM THE IMAM AL-SHAFI'I MOHAMMED IBN IDRIS WHO DIED IN EGYPT A.H
BUT I SOFT WHISPERING URGED YES
ACCORDINGLY SHARRKAN AROSE ON THE INSTANT AND CHOSE OUT A MYRIAD OF HORSEMEN AFTER WHICH HE ENTERED HIS PALACE AND MUSTERED HIS HOST AND DISTRIBUTED LARGESSE TO THEM SAYING YE HAVE DELAY OF THREE DAYS THEY KISSED THE EARTH BEFORE HIM IN OBEDIENCE TO HIS COMMANDS AND BEGAN AT ONCE TO LAY IN MUNITIONS AND PROVIDE PROVISIONS FOR THE OCCASION
FOR THE WAGE IS MEASURED BY THE WORK SHARRKAN REJOINED PRAY FOR ME AND HE PRAYED FOR HIM
AND THE SAGES MUST BE MOSLEMS THAT THEY MAY TEACH THEM THE LANGUAGE AND TRADITIONS OF THE ARABS TOGETHER WITH THE HISTORY OF THE CALIPHS AND THE ANCIENT ANNALS OF THE KINGS OF AL-ISLAM
WHEREAT THEY REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND WONDERED AT THE HAPPY CHANCE
AND SO IT CONTINUED A WHOLE MONTH BOTH PASSING THE NIGHT ON A SINGLE CARPET BED BUT WHENEVER HE WOULD ENJOY HER SHE PUT HIM OFF
FN#529 THE KASABAH WAS ABOUT TWO FATHOMS OF LONG MEASURE AND SOMETIMES 12 FEET

ALL WE CAN SAY IS-THAT IT IMPROVES UPON HINDUISM WHICH PRACTICALLY SEEMS TO LEAVE THE PUNISHMENT TO THE GODS
NUR AL-DIN LOOKED AT HIM AND SAW IT WAS HIS FOE THAT SOUGHT TO COMPASS HIS DEATH
SHE WAS MAGNIFIED IN HIS EYES AND HE SAID ALLAH MAKE THIS PIOUS WOMAN TO PROFIT US THEN HE AGREED WITH HER TO FAST FOR A MONTH AS SHE HAD STIPULATED AND SHE SAID TO HIM I WILL HELP THEE WITH THE PRAYERS I PRAY FOR THEE AND NOW BRING ME A GUGGLET OF WATER THEY BROUGHT ONE AND SHE TOOK IT AND RECITED OVER IT AND MUTTERED SPELLS AND SAT FOR AN HOUR SPEAKING IN SPEECH NO ONE UNDERSTOOD OR KNEW AUGHT THEREOF
THE MERCY OF ALLAH ALMIGHTY BE UPON HER FOR SHE KEPT HER SECRET AND REVEALED NOT WHAT SHE SUFFERED AND BUT FOR HER THOU HADST NEVER FOREGATHERED WITH ME
WHEREUPON LIFE RETURNED TO HIM EMACIATED AND WITHERED AS HE WAS AND HE RAISED HIS HEAD FROM THE PILLOW AND CRIED ALOUD O KUT AL-KULUB SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND MADE CERTAIN IT WAS HE AND SHRIEKED RATHER THAN SAID YES O MY BELOVED DRAW NEAR TO ME SAID HE AND SHE REPLIED SURELY THOU ART GHANIM BIN AYYUB
BUT BY ALLAH HE SPARES US GREAT AND SMALL
FOR WHOM IS THIS SECOND BED ASKED SHE AND HE ANSWERED HER ONE IS FOR ME AND THE OTHER IS FOR THEE

KHATTAF A SNATCHER I.E
AND MATRUHINA SHALL BE A SACRIFICE FOR THE FOLLOWERS OF THE NAZARENE FAITH AND THE SERVANTS OF THE CROSS AND PRAISE BE TO THE MESSIAH FIRST AND LAST WHEN THIS LETTER REACHED CONSTANTINOPLE THE KEEPER OF THE CARRIER PIGEONS CARRIED IT TO KING AFRIDUN WHO READ IT AND FORTHWITH INSPECTED HIS HOST AND EQUIPPED TEN THOUSAND CAVALIERS WITH HORSES AND DROMEDARIES AND MULES AND PROVAUNT AND BADE THEM REPAIR TO THAT HERMITAGE AND AFTER REACHING THE TOWER TO HIDE THEREIN
SO SHE SAT DOWN ON THE STOOL OF DELIVERY AND ALLAH MADE THE TRAVAIL EASY TO HER AND SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A BOY CHILD ON WHOM APPEARED AUSPICIOUS SIGNS
THE DERIVATION OF ARAB FROM YA'ARAB A FANCIED SON OF JOKTAN IS MYTHOLOGICAL
WHEN IT WAS THE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEENTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE YOUNG MERCHANT CONTINUED TO TAJ AL-MULUK
IF I PASS THE NIGHT ABROAD THE THIEVES WILL STEAL MY MONEY BAGS AND MY BALES TO BOOT SO WHEN HE COULD NO LONGER CONTROL HIS FEAR HE AROSE AND LEFT THE ASSEMBLY HAVING FIRST ASKED LEAVE TO GO ABOUT SOME URGENT BUSINESS
AND NUR AL-DIN REMEMBERING HIS ENTERTAINMENTS OF TIME PAST CRIED BY ALLAH THIS IS A PLEASANT PLACE
AND NECKS WERE STRETCHED OUT TO SEE THE SIGHT NOR DID THEY STINT FROM STRIFE AND SWORD PLAY AND LUNGE OF LANCE WITH MAIN AND MIGHT TILL THE DAY TURNED TO NIGHT AND DARKNESS OVERWHELMED THE LIGHT
A LOAF OF BREAD IS SOMETIMES ADDED
AH ME
UPON THEE AFTER ALLAH IS OUR DEPENDENCE AND WE WILL ALL BE THY RANSOM FROM AUGHT THAT CAN HARM THEE ZAU AL-MAKAN THANKED HIM THEREFOR AND THE SLOGAN AROSE AND THE SABRE WAS DRAWN
SO AL-MU'IN LOOKED AT THE BROKER AND SAID TO HIM WHY STAND STILL
FN#302 MEANING IT WAS DECREED BY DESTINY
INTENDING US TO PRONOUNCE YACOB OR YAKOB YERICHO YIMNITES YOB OR HIOB AND YUDAH
BY ALLAH HE IS COME OF GOOD FOLK AND HE BEARETH THE SIGNS OF GENTLE BREEDING
O EDEN MY SOUL HATH FLED IN DESPITE OF THE MAID I LOVE
FOR WHOSO DECLINETH FROM WHAT PEN HATH WRITTEN HIS FEET SLIP AND THE KING SHALL RECTIFY HIS ERROR WITH THE SHARP SWORD AND DISPREAD HIS JUSTICE OVER ALL MANKIND
HE ALSO COMMANDED TO CRY THROUGHOUT THE CITY THAT NEITHER CURTAINED DAMSEL NOR HONOURED LADY NOR TIME-RUPTURED CRONE SHOULD FAIL TO FARE FORTH AND MEET THE BRIDE
DEATH AND IT AGONIES SEEM LIGHT TO ME SINCE LIFE HAS LOST ALL JOYS AND JOLLITIES
IN THE NIGHTS IT IS USED TO SIGNIFY A FINE GEM FN#185 THIS PROMINENCE OF THE GLUTAEI MUSCLES IS ALWAYS INSISTED UPON BECAUSE IT IS SUPPOSED TO PROMISE WELL IN A BED-FELLOW
FOR IN WRESTLING THERE ARE SHIFTS AND TRIPS CATCHES AND HOLDS SUCH AS THE FEINT OR FALSING AND THE SNAP OR FIRST GRIP THE HUG THE FEET-CATCH THE THIGH LITE,[FN#175 THE JOSTLE AND THE LEG-LOCK BY ALLAH O MY LADY QUOTH SHARRKAN AND INDEED HE WAS HIGHLY INCENSED AGAINST HER HAD I BEEN MASTER AL-SAFDI MASTER MOHAMMED KIMAL OR IBN AL-SADDI,[FN#176 AS THEY WERE IN THEIR PRIME I HAD KEPT NO NOTE OF THESE SHIFTS THOU MENTIONEST
WITH ALL THIS GEAR HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE
NOW ASK ME NOT WHAT NEXT OCCURRED SEEK GRACE OF GOD AND WHIST OF THIS
BUT MY STORY IS A LONG ONE AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO TELL IT
THEN THEY AGAIN SET OUT AND STAYED NOT RIDING FOR FIVE AND TWENTY DAYS WHICH PLACED THEM ON THE FRONTIERS OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY
TO DAY'S AND YESTERDAY'S YES REPLIED SHE MY NAME IN THE PAST WAS NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN THE DELIGHT OF THE AGE
TIS EVER NATURE'S TEST THAT NOBLES BORN OF NOBLES SHALL EXCEL IN NOBLE DEED
SO THEY CALLED A TRUCE AND EACH ARMY RETURNED TO ITS TENTS WHILST ALL THE INFIDELS REPAIRED TO KING AFRIDUN AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE HIM AND THE PRIESTS AND MONKS WISHED HIM JOY OF HIS VICTORY OVER SHARRKAN
XXVIII FN#83 IT IS MERITORIOUS TO ACCOMPANY THE FUNERAL CORTEGE OF A MOSLEM EVEN FOR A FEW PACES
SO I STOOD UP AND SHOOK MY CLOTHES AND TURNED TO LOOK RIGHT AND LEFT BUT COULD SEE NO ONE
AND AS FOR HER SIGN WITH THE LAMP IT DENOTED WHEN THOU ENTEREST THE FLOWER GARDEN WALK DOWN IT AND MAKE FOR THE PLACE WHERE THOU SEEST THE LAMP SHINING
ALSO THAT HE WAS SENT BY HIS SIRE WITH THIS FORCE TO GAIN PREVALENCE FOR THE KING OF CONSTANTINOPLE O MY LADY SAID SHARRKAN I ADJURE THEE BY THY RELIGION TELL ME THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS THAT SOOTH MAY APPEAR TO ME CLEAR OF UNTRUTH AND WITH WHOM THE FAULT LIES NOW BY THE VIRTUE OF THY FAITH SHE REPLIED DID I NOT FEAR LEST THE NEWS OF ME BE BRUITED ABROAD THAT I AM OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ROUM I WOULD ADVENTURE MYSELF AND SALLY FORTH SINGLE HANDED AGAINST THE TEN THOUSAND HORSEMEN AND SLAY THEIR LEADER THE WAZIR DANDAN AND VANQUISH THEIR CHAMPION SHARRKAN.[FN#182 NOR WOULD AUGHT OF SHAME ACCRUE TO ME THEREBY FOR I HAVE READ BOOKS AND STUDIED THE RULES OF GOOD BREEDING IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ARABS
BUT UNTO ALLAH WE ARE ALL RETURNING THEN THE EUNUCH CRIED UPON THE PAGES SAYING TAKE HIM OFF THE ASS SO THEY CARRIED HIM ALONG WITH THE CARAVAN SURROUNDED BY THE PAGES AS THE WHITE CONTAINS THE BLACK OF THE EYE
WHEREUPON MY COUSIN SWOONED AGAIN AND WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF SHE RECITED THESE TWO COUPLETS HEARKENING OBEYING WITH MY DYING MOUTH I GREET WHO JOY OF UNION NE'ER ALLOW'TH

WHEN THEY CAME UP KING HARDUB SAW HIS DAUGHTER LYING DEAD AND MARJANAH WEEPING OVER HER AND HE THREW HIMSELF FROM HIS STEED AND FELL FAINTING TO THE GROUND
AND AFTER THREE DAYS I WILL BE WITH YOU ALL AND WE WILL ENTER BAGHDAD TOGETHER AS HE TURNED TO DEPART SHE SAID FORGET NOT THE COMPACT WHICH IS BETWEEN ME AND THEE THEN SHE ROSE TO BID[FN#212 HIM FAREWELL AND EMBRACE HIM AND QUENCH THE FIRE OF DESIRE SO SHE TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND THROWING HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK WEPT WITH EXCEEDING WEEPING AND REPEATED THESE VERSES I BADE ADIEU MY RIGHT HAND WIPED MY TEARS AWAY THE WHILE MY LEFT HAND HELD HER IN A CLOSE EMBRACE
NEXT DAY THE KING FASTED AND THE OLD WOMAN WENT HER WAYS."--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
AND THE CONTENTS OF THESE SAUCERS WERE PART SWEET AND PART SOUR
FOR THOU PROFESSES TO BE OF THE LOVERS NOBLE AND TRUE
WHEN ZAT AL-DAWAHI HEARD TELL OF HER SON'S DEATH AND SHE STILL DREST AS A DEVOTEE HER FACE WAXED YELLOW AND HER EYES RAN OVER WITH RAILING TEARS
TEARS O MINE EYES HAVE NOW BECOME YOUR WONT YE WEEP FOR PLEASURE AND YOU WEEP FOR PINE THEY SAT AWHILE AT THE LITTER DOOR TILL SHE SAID TO HIM COME WITH ME INTO THE LITTER AND TELL ME ALL THAT HATH BEFALLEN THEE AND I WILL TELL THEE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME SO THEY ENTERED AND ZAU AL-MAKEN SAID DO THOU BEGIN THY TALE ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI
BUT IF YOU SAY BRING ME FIRE
SO THE BADAWI CAME UP TO HER AND SAID O THOU CITY FILTH BY THE RIGHT OF MY BONNET IF THOU LEAVE NOT THIS WEEPING I WILL SELL THEE TO NONE BUT A JEW THEN HE AROSE AND TOOK HER BY THE HAND AND CARRIED HER TO A CHAMBER AND WALKED OFF TO THE BAZAR AND HE WENT ROUND TO THE MERCHANTS WHO DEALT IN SLAVE GIRLS AND BEGAN TO PARLEY WITH THEM SAYING I HAVE BROUGHT A SLAVE GIRL WHOSE BROTHER FELL ILL AND I SENT HIM TO MY PEOPLE ABOUT JERUSALEM THAT THEY MIGHT TEND HIM TILL HE IS CURED
AND SHE PROMISED THEM ALL MANNER OF GOOD AND SEATED THEM IN THEIR PROPER STATIONS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP WITH THEM
NOW AS SOON AS DAWNED THE MORN THE CHAMBERLAIN SIGNALLED TO THE HOST AN ORDER FOR DEPARTURE AND THEY SET OUT THINKING THAT THE TWO KINGS AND THE WAZIR WERE WITH THEM
PRESENTLY HE AWOKE AND OPENING HIS EYES SHUT THEM AGAIN AND HEARD THE HANDMAID AT HIS HEAD SAYING TO HER WHO WAS AT HIS FEET A NICE BUSINESS THIS O KHAYZARAN AND THE OTHER ANSWERED HER WELL O KAZIB AL-BAN?"[FN#119 VERILY SAID THE FIRST OUR LORD KNOWETH NAUGHT OF WHAT HATH HAPPENED AND SITTETH WAKING AND WATCHING BY A TOMB WHEREIN IS ONLY A LOG OF WOOD CARVED BY THE CARPENTER'S ART AND KUT AL-KULUB QUOTH THE OTHER WHAT HATH BEFALLEN HER SHE REPLIED KNOW THAT THE LADY ZUBAYDAH SENT A PELLET OF BHANG BY ONE OF THE SLAVE WOMEN WHO WAS BRIBED TO DRUG HER
THEN HUNGER GREW SORE UPON ME FOR THAT IT WAS LONG SINCE I HAD TASTED FOOD BY REASON OF THE VIOLENCE OF MY LOVE
NOW WHEN ZAU AL-MAKAN AND THE WAZIR DANDAN SAW THAT THE INFIDEL HOST OFFERED THEM NO LET AND STAY AND YET HAD THEM IN SIGHT THE WAZIR EXCLAIMED BY ALLAH THIS IS ONE OF THE HOLY MAN'S SAINTLY MIRACLES
AND THUS THOU SHALT ESCAPE PLEASE ALMIGHTY ALLAH FROM THIS SLOUGH OF DESPOND WHEN THE LADY ZUBAYDAH HEARD HER WORDS SHE COMMENDED THE COUNSEL AND GAVE HER A DRESS OF HONOUR AND A LARGE SUM OF MONEY ORDERING HER TO DO ALL SHE HAD SAID

SO I HASTENED TO FINISH MY ABLUTION AND FOLLOWED HIM
SO THE MESSENGER COMING FORWARD INFORMED HIM OF THE APPROACH OF THE WAZIR OF THE MIGHTY KING SULAYMAN SHAH LORD OF THE GREEN LAND AND OF THE MOUNTAINS OF ISPAHAN
THE GARB OF MINE EXCUSE THIS PARTING RENT BUT I WILL MEND THAT GARB AGAIN
NOW THERE ARE BUT TWENTY THOUSAND HORSE AND THE UNBELIEVERS OUTNUMBER THEM

SO THEY BOTH TRAVELLED ON WITH THE CARAVAN WHILST THE CHAMBERLAIN NOW RODE BY THE DOOR OF HIS WIFE'S LITTER IN ATTENDANCE ON ZAU AL-MAKAN AND HIS SISTER AND NOW GAVE AN EYE TO THE FIREMAN
FN#131 THIS HATRED OF THE HOSPITAL EXTENDS THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN EUROPE EVEN IN PLACES WHERE IT IS NOT JUSTIFIED
IF THOU ACT BY MY ADVICE IT MAY BE WE SHALL APPROVE OURSELVES THE CAUSE OF THEIR DELIVERANCE IN CASE THEY BE HARD PRESSED BY THE INFIDELS
HOWEVER SHE MANAGED THE MATTER ADVISEDLY AND HID IT FROM THE GIRL'S FATHER OUT OF GOOD WILL TO ME
NOW THERE WAS WITH THEM ALSO A FAMOUS CAVALIER LAWIYA HIGHS WHO COMMANDED THE CENTRE
AND AS SOON AS HE REVIVED HE EXCLAIMED SURELY THE MESSIAH WAS WROTH WITH THEM THAT HE CAUSED THE MOSLEMS TO PREVAIL OVER THEM THEN CAME THE ARCH PATRIARCH SADLY TO THE KING WHO SAID TO HIM O OUR FATHER ANNIHILATION HATH OVERTAKEN OUR ARMY AND THE MESSIAH HATH PUNISHED US REPLIED THE PATRIARCH GRIEVE NOT NOR FEEL CONCERNED FOR IT CANNOT BE BUT THAT ONE OF YOU HAVE SINNED AGAINST THE MESSIAH AND ALL HAVE BEEN PUNISHED FOR HIS OFFENCE

MOREOVER SHARRKAN HAD SENT FOR ALL THE SINGING WOMEN OF DAMASCUS AND THEY WERE PRESENT TOGETHER WITH EVERY SLAVE GIRL OF THE KING AND OF THE NOTABLES WHO KNEW HOW TO SING

AT THE DOOR HE FOUND HIS STEWARD AND ASKED HIM WHAT IS THE MATTER

LET THINE AFFAIRS BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BE IN ALLAH'S CHARGE AND FEAR HIM WITH THE FEAR OF ONE WHO KNOWETH HE IS DEAD AND WHO FARETH TOWARDS RESURRECTION AND JUDGEMENT STEAD BETWEEN THE HANDS OF THE LORD OF DREAD

WILL NONE REPLY TO ME
HEADS FROM BODIES FLEW END TONGUES MUTE GREW AND EYES NO VISION KNEW
QUOTH SHARRKAN TO HIMSELF EVERY LUCK HATH ITS CAUSE
ALL THY WORLDLY LIFE IS VEXING OF THY SOUL IN VAIN DISPLAY
41 I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE NAT'A IS MADE LIKE THE SUFRAH OF WELL-TANNED LEATHER WITH RINGS IN THE PERIPHERY SO THAT A THONG PASSED THROUGH TURNS IT INTO A BAG
HE SAW ALL THE PAGES AND EUNUCHS AND HANDMAIDS HABITED IN BLACK AT WHICH HIS HEART FLUTTERED WITH EXTREME FEAR
WERE SHE YET ALIVE SHE WOULD PROTECT THEE
AND AS FOR THE HANDMAIDS BY ALLAH THEY SHALL NEVER BE THY SPOIL
SO HE MADE A PROSTRATION OF THANKS TO THE BOUNTIFUL AND THE EXALTED
296 AND IN ACTS III
WHILST AT THE UPPER END STOOD A THRONE SPREAD WITH SILKS FIT ONLY FOR KINGS
SO RETURN TO HIM O THOU MONK AND SAY THAT THE SINGLE COMBAT SHALL TAKE PLACE TO MORROW FOR THIS DAY WE HAVE COME OFF OUR JOURNEY AND ARE AWEARY
BUT AS SOON AS SHE SAW ME SHE ROSE WITH THE TEARS RUNNING FROM HER EYES AND CAME UP TO ME AND KISSED ME ON THE BREAST AND SAID DIDST THOU DO AS I ENJOINED THEE
THE MYTH OF DAVID INVENTING MAIL POSSIBLY AROSE FROM HIS PECULIARLY FIGHTING CAREER
THEN THE ACCURSED OLD WOMAN CUT OFF THAT KNIGHT'S HEAD AND BROUGHT IT AND THREW IT AT THE FEET OF SHARRKAN AND ZAU AL-MAKAN AND THE WAZIR DANDAN
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT HOODING THE EYES WITH THIS ARTICLE BADAWI-FASHION PRODUCES A SENSATION OF COOLNESS AT ANY RATE A MARKED DIFFERENCE OF APPARENT TEMPERATURE
WHERE AT I WAS ANGRY AND SAID TO MYSELF I HAVE BEEN ABSENT THIS WHOLE YEAR AND COME HERE UNAWARES AND FIND THE PLACE OPEN AS OF WONT
THE SENTIMENT IS TRITE
BUT WHEN ZAU AL-MAKAN FARED FORTH INTO THE FIELD THERE CAME WITH HIM THE WAZIR DANDAN AND THE CHAMBERLAIN AND BAHRAM SAYING WE WILL BE THY SACRIFICE HE REPLIED BY THE HOLY HOUSE AND ZEMZEM AND THE PLACE![FN#450 I WILL NOT BE STAYED FROM GOING FORTH AGAINST THESE WILD ASSES AND WHEN HE RODE OUT INTO THE FIELD HE PLAYED WITH SWORD AND SPEAR TILL RIDERS MARVELLED AND BOTH ARMIES WONDERED
HENCE ALSO THE SAYING OF MOHAMMED PERFUMES FOR MEN SHOULD HAVE SCENT AND NOT COLOUR
WHEN THE VILLAGERS CAME TO PRAY THE DAWN PRAYER THEY FOUND HIM PROSTRATE AILING HUNGER LEAN YET SHOWING EVIDENT SIGNS OF FORMER AFFLUENCE
NOR DID I EVER DISPUTE WITH ANYONE AT ALL BUT FOR THE SHOWING FORTH OF THE TRUTH AND I RECK NOT WHETHER ALLAH MANIFEST IT BY MY TONGUE OR BY HIS HE SAID ALSO WHOM ALLAH ACCEPT IF THOU FEAR TO GROW CONCEITED OF THY LORE THEN BETHINK THEE WHOSE GRACE THOU SEEKEST AND FOR WHAT GOOD THOU YEARNEST AND WHAT PUNISHMENT THOU DREADEST IT WAS TOLD TO ABU HANIFAH THAT THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL ABU JA'AFAR AL-MANSUR HAD APPOINTED HIM KAZI AND ORDERED HIM A SALARY OF TEN THOUSAND DIRHAMS

AND SHE FILLED HIM A THIRD WHICH HE TOOK AND WAS ABOUT TO DRINK WHEN BEHOLD NUR AL-DIN ROLLED ROUND AND SAT UPRIGHT,--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
THE CHAMBERLAIN MARVELLED AT THIS
BUT SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID O MY LORD ART THOU FARING FORTH WITHOUT FAREWELL
FN#442 I.E
AND HE ANSWERED O MY LADY THY SPEECH AS REGARDS SLAYING ME IS NOT OTHER THAN UNLAWFUL
SHE BURST ON MY SIGHT WITH CHEEKS ROSY RED WHERE ALL MANNER OF BEAUTIES HAVE HABITANCE
IF POVERTY CHOKE HIM HIS HEART IS DISTRACTED BY WOE OR IF DISQUIETUDE WASTE HIS HEART WEAKNESS CAUSETH HIM TO FALL
THEN SEND HER TO THE HAMMAM AND CLOTHE HER IN THE RICHEST OF CLOTHES AND GO UP WITH HER TO THE SULTAN
O JA'AFAR NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I HEARD A VOICE SO ENCHANTING AS THIS THEN HAPLY THE CALIPH'S WRATH HATH PASSED AWAY SAID JA'AFAR AND HE REPLIED YES TIS GONE THEREUPON THEY DESCENDED FROM THE TREE AND THE CALIPH SAID TO JA'AFAR I WISH TO GO IN AND SIT WITH THEM AND HEAR THE DAMSEL SING BEFORE ME O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL REPLIED JA'AFAR IF THOU GO IN TO THEM THEY WILL BE TERRIBLY TROUBLED AND SHAYKH IBRAHIM WILL ASSUREDLY DIE OF FRIGHT BUT THE CALIPH ANSWERED O JA'AFAR THOU MUST TEACH ME SOME DEVICE WHEREWITH TO DELUDE THEM AND WHEREBY I CAN FOREGATHER WITH THEM WITHOUT THEIR KNOWING ME SO THEY WALKED TOWARDS THE TIGRIS PONDERING THE MATTER AND PRESENTLY CAME UPON A FISHERMAN WHO STOOD FISHING UNDER THE PAVILION WINDOWS
NOW IS ALLAH IS ALMIGHTY BIS I DECLARE NO GOD IS THERE BUT ALLAH BIS HIE YE TO ROGATION HAYYA=HALUMMA HIE YE TO SALVATION FALAH=PROSPERITY PARADISE HIE YE TO EDIFICATION A SHI'AH ADJUNCT PRAYER IS BETTER THAN SLEEP IN THE MORNING ALSO BIS NO GOD IS THERE BUT ALLAH THIS PRAYER CALL IS SIMILARLY WORDED AND DIFFERENTLY PRONOUNCED AND INTONED THROUGHOUT AL-ISLAM
RETURN QUICKLY AND LINGER NOT."--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
WHEREUPON THE SLAVE EXCLAIMED O ALLAH AS THOU HAST BESTOWED ON ME THE LESSER EMANCIPATION
AFTER THIS FASHION HE DID FOR FOUR DAYS FULL TOLD AND HE LAVISHED UPON SOPHIA RAIMENT AND ORNAMENTS AND GREAT STORE OF WEALTH
FOR OF A TRUTH I CANNOT BEAR TO PART WITH THEE
I HAD INDEED SUPPLICATED HIM THAT I MIGHT RETURN TO MY NATIVE LAND NOT AS A COMPENSATION FOR THE SUFFERINGS DECREED TO ME BUT THAT I MIGHT DIE UNDER THE HORSE HOOFS OF WARRIORS FIGHTING FOR THE FAITH WHO BEING SLAIN IN FRAY LIVE AGAIN WITHOUT SUFFERING DEATH."[FN#422 THEN SHE REPEATED THE FOLLOWING COUPLETS OUR FORT IS TOR,[FN#423 AND FLAMES THE FIRE OF FIGHT
SHE WAS LOOKING OUT OF A WICKET IN A LATTICE OF BRASS AND NEVER SAW MY EYES A FAIRER THAN SHE AND IN FINE MY TONGUE FAILETH TO DESCRIBE HER BEAUTY
185
BUT ONLY WESTERNS AND THESE CHIEFLY ENGLISH SWEAR A PRACTICE UTTERLY MEANINGLESS
LISTEN TO WHAT THE POET SAID FLY FLY WITH THY LIFE IF BY ILL OVERTAKEN
THE BROKER ANSWERED WE HAD OPENED THE BIDDINGS FOR HER AT FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DINARS
NOR DID WE HEAR MORE OF HER TILL THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR WHEN HER FATHER WROTE TO MY FATHER IN WORDS UNFITTING FOR ME TO REPEAT REBUKING HIM WITH MENACES AND SAYING TO HIM
THE WAZIR AL-MU'IN BIN SAWI PASSED THROUGH THE BAZAR AND SEEING NUR AL-DIN ALI WAITING AT ONE SIDE SAID TO HIMSELF WHY IS KHAKAN'S SON[FN#33 STANDING ABOUT HERE
I HAVE QUOTED TORRENS P
I FOUND THEM ALSO IN THE OFFICIAL NOT THE TEMPLE)CITY OF PALMYRA BUT ALL BROKEN
AND WHY HAST THOU ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN WHICH HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THINE ABSENCE ANSWERED I O DAUGHTER OF MINE UNCLE QUESTION ME NOT CONCERNING WHAT HATH BEFALLEN ME."[FN#487 THEN I TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD PASSED FROM BEGINNING TO END AND SHOWED HER THE HANDKERCHIEF
PRESENTLY BY DECREE OF THE DECREER A HANDMAID AMONG THE HANDMAIDS OF OMAR BIN NU'UMAN BECAME PREGNANT
AND HIS MOTHER AND SISTER CAME OUT AMONG THE CROWD TO GAZE UPON HIM BUT THEY KNEW HIM NOT
SO SHE IMPLORED ALLAH ALMIGHTY TO DO AWAY WITH THESE CALAMITIES FROM THEM AND BEGAN VERSIFYING DARK FALLS THE NIGHT AND PASSION COMES SORE PAINS TO GAR ME DREE AND PINE UPSTIRS THOSE CEASELESS PANGS WHICH WORK MY TORMENTRY AND CEASE NOT SEPARATION FLAMES MY VITALS TO CONSUME AND DRIVES ME ON DESTRUCTION WAY THIS SORROW'S ECSTACY AND LONGING BREEDS ME RESTLESSNESS
EVEN AS WAS SAID OF HIM HOLD TO NOBLES SONS OF NOBLES
MOHAMMED REPEATEDLY PROTESTED AGAINST SUCH UNCEREMONIOUS CONDUCT KORAN XCIV
AH MAY TH EX CHANGE SECURE THEE EVERY BENISON
IF YE ACCEPT IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU
FN#515 ALLUDING TO THE CEREMONIOUS CIRCUMAMBULATION OF THE HOLY HOUSE AT MECCAH
FN#440 THEY ARE SAD DOGGREL LIKE MOST OF THE PIECES D'OCCASION INSERTED IN THE NIGHTS
AND HE ANSWERED I LEFT HIM IN EARLY DAY ON THE BANKS OF SUCH A RIVER AND TOMORROW HE WILL REACH THEE ALLAH CONTINUE HIS FAVOURS TO THEE AND HAVE MERCY UPON THY PARENTS THEREUPON KING ZAHR SHAH COMMANDED ONE OF HIS WAZIRS TO TAKE THE BETTER PART OF HIS GRANDEES AND CHAMBERLAINS AND LIEUTENANTS AND LORDS OF THE LAND AND GO OUT TO MEET THE AMBASSADOR IN HONOUR OF KING SULAYMAN SHAH
AFTER WHICH SHE SPRINKLED ME WITH ROSE WATER AND I SAT WITH HER AWHILE IN THE BEST OF SPIRITS
THUS IN ANY CASE NOTHING PROFITETH HIM BUT THAT HE BE MINDFUL OF ALLAH AND OCCUPY HIMSELF WITH GAINING HIS LIVELIHOOD IN THIS WORLD AND SECURING HIS PLACE IN THE NEXT
TO OTHER GIVING HER AND UNTO ME HER LOVE WHAT LOSS BUT LAYLA'S LOSS WOULD HE I EVER DREE AH AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED HER RECITING SHE LOOKED TOWARDS ME AND SEEING ME THROUGH HER TEARS WIPED THEM AWAY AND CAME UP TO ME HASTILY BUT COULD NOT SPEAK FOR EXCESS OF LOVE
I KEN THY WORK IS OTHER THAN PRAISEWORTHY NOR IS THY PROWESS THAT OF A PRINCE
WHEN IT WAS THE SIXTY-FIFTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT NUZHAT AL ZAMAN CONTINUED THUS SAID OMAR VERILY ALLAH COMMISSIONED AS HIS APOSTLE MOHAMMED UPON WHOM BE THE BENEDICTION OF ALLAH AND HIS SALVATION FOR A BLESSING TO SOME AND A BANE TO OTHERS
26
I NEEDS MUST GO TO THEM SO JA'AFAR HELD HIS PEACE BEING BEWILDERED AND KNOWING NOT WHAT TO DO
REPLIED THE UNBELIEVERS BY THE TRUTH OF THE MESSIAH AND THE MONKS AND THE PRIMATE AND THE METROPOLITAN WE SEE NONE SAVE YOU TWO THEN ZAU AL-MAKAN SAID BY ALLAH THIS IS A CHASTISEMENT DECREED TO US BY ALMIGHTY ALLAH!"--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
AND I FOUND TO MY SURPRISE THAT THE ABSURD SCANDAL WAS ALREADY TWENTY YEARS OLD
AND THEY SAID WE BESEECH ALLAH TO REUNITE US WITH HIM WHOM WE DESIRE AND HE IS NONE OTHER BUT MY SON NAMED GHANIM BIN AYYUD WHEN KUT AL-KULUB HEARD THIS SHE KNEW THEM TO BE THE MOTHER AND SISTER OF HER LOVER AND WEPT TILL A SWOON CAME OVER HER
AND THE WAZIR LOADED THE WHOLE ON CAMELS AND MULES AND SET OUT ATTENDED BY AN HUNDRED SLAVE GIRLS WITH FLAGS AND BANNERS FLAUNTING OVER HIS HEAD
88 WHEN YOU ARE SALUTED WITH A SALUTATION SALUTE THE PERSON WITH A BETTER SALUTATION THE LONGER ANSWER TO PEACE BE WITH OR UPON THEE
WHEN IT WAS THE ONE HUNDRED AND SECOND NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SHARRKAN SAW THE MOSLEMS IN CONQUERED PLIGHT AND THE CHAMBERLAIN UPON THE BRINK OF RETREAT AND FLIGHT AND THE SWORD HAVOC DIGHT AMONG THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE WORKERS OF UPRIGHT THE CAUSE OF THIS WEAKNESS AMONG THE MOSLEMS WAS THAT THE ACCURSED OLD WOMAN ZAT AL DAWAHI THE FOE OF THE FAITH AFTER SEEING THAT BAHRAM AND RUSTAM HAD SET FORWARD WITH THEIR TROOPS TO JOIN SHARRKAN AND HIS BROTHER ZAU AL-MAKAN REPAIRED TO THE CAMP OF THE MAHOMETANS BEFORE CONSTANTINOPLE AND CAUSED THE MISSION OF THE EMIR TARKASH AS HATH BEEN BEFORE SAID
AND SEAT THYSELF BENEATH IT AND AWAIT ME
BUT I WILL MENTION WHAT OCCURRETH TO ME THEREOF CONCERNING THE PIOUS OF OLD
THEN SHE OPENED HER EYES AND GLANCING AROUND SAID IN SWEET VOICE AND GRACIOUS WORDS WOE TO THEE O WIND
THE WORLD TO FOES HATH TURNED MY FIRM ALLIES
AND THE KING GAVE ORDER THAT THE BOY SHOULD BE NAMED ZAU AL-MAKAN AND HIS SISTER NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN.[FN#149 THEY ANSWERED HEARING AND OBEDIENCE AND DID HIS BIDDING
FN#531 DALIL MEANS A GUIDE
I ATE A MOUTHFUL OF EACH KIND AND AS MUCH AS I WOULD OF THE SWEETMEATS AND A PIECE OF MEAT
IF THEN YE WILL
SO MAKE ME NOT A TRAITOR TO MY GUEST AND A DISGRACE AMONG MEN
SO THE MAN WENT AND RETURNING WITH THE SUIT KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE THE CALIPH AND GAVE IT HIM
NOR BE THOU NIGGARDLY WITH THEM OR THEY WILL MURMUR AGAINST THEE
2 FN#2 VOL 1]AND NOTE 2 P
BUT HER LOVELINESS RESTRAINED HIM AND HE BEGAN REPEATING AN FAULTY OF ONE FAULT THE BEAUTY PROVE HER CHARMS A THOUSAND ADVOCATES SHALL MOVE SO SHE WENT UP AND SHARRKAN AFTER HER
GIVE THY GIVING DELIBERATELY AND CONFER THY FAVOURS ADVISEDLY
NOW THE STOKER USED TO WORK AT THE HAMMAM ALL DAY FOR A WAGE OF FIVE DIRHAMS WHEREOF HE SPENT EVERY DAY FOR ZAU AL-MAKAN ONE DIRHAM UPON SUGAR AND SHERBET OF ROSE WATER AND WILLOW FLOWER WATER,[FN#236 AND ANOTHER DIRHAM FOR FOWLS

WHEN THE MORNING MORROWED AS WE WENT OUR WAY BEHOLD WE FELL IN WITH A FUNERAL TRAIN FOLLOWED BY AN OLD WOMAN WHOSE STRENGTH HAD LEFT HER

SO HE LEFT HER AND RETURNED TO HIS TENT AND WOULD HAVE SLEPT
WHEN TAJ AL-MULUK SAW THEM HE SAID TO ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS BRING ME NEWS OF YONDER MEN AND QUESTION THEM WHY THEY HAVE HALTED IN THIS PLACE."[FN#474 SO THE MESSENGER WENT UP TO THEM AND ADDRESSED THEM TELL ME WHO YE BE AND ANSWER ME AN ANSWER WITHOUT DELAY REPLIED THEY WE ARE MERCHANTS AND HAVE HALTED TO REST FOR THAT THE NEXT STATION IS DISTANT AND WE ABIDE HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN KING SULAYMAN SHAH AND HIS SON TAJ AL-MULUK AND WE KNOW THAT ALL WHO ALIGHT IN HIS DOMINIONS ARE IN PEACE AND SAFETY

FN#37 THIS HASHIMI VEIN AS THEY CALL IT WAS AN ABNORMAL DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN THE EYES OF THE HOUSE OF ABBAS INHERITED FROM THE GREAT GRANDFATHER OF THE PROPHET
FOR BY ALLAH WERE HE A MAN OF SENSE HE WOULD NOT SAY BY THE RIGHTS OF MY BONNET BY THE ALMIGHTY SHE IS WORTH THE KINGDOM OF THE CHOSROES AND I HAVE NOT HER PRICE BY ME BUT IF HE ASK EVEN MORE I WILL GIVE HIM WHAT HE WILL THOUGH IT BE ALL MY GOODS THEN HE TURNED AND SAID TO HIM O SHAYKH OF THE ARABS TAKE PATIENCE AND CALM THYSELF AND TELL ME WHAT CLOTHES SHE HATH WITH THEE CRIED THE BADAWI AND WHAT HATH THE BAGGAGE TO DO WITH CLOTHES

THEN THEY LAID SHARRKEN OUT AND BURIED HIM IN THE MOUNTAIN AFORESAID AND MOURNED OVER HIS FAR-FAMED VIRTUES.--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
INSHALLAH I WILL DO MY UTMOST ENDEAVOUR TO UNITE YOU
FN#326 ARAB
SHE IN THE HEAVEN OF HER FACE[FN#7 THE SEVEN-FOLD STARS DISPLAYS THAT GUARD HER CHEEKS AS SATELLITES AGAINST THE SPY'S DESIGN
FN#54 HE MEANS WE ARE ZAHIRI PLAIN HONEST MOSLEMS NOT BATINI GNOSTICS ERGO REPROBATES AND SO FORTH WHO DISREGARD ALL APPEARANCES AND EXTERNAL ORDINANCES
OMAR'S DAUGHTER AND ONE OF MOHAMMED'S WIVES FAMOUS FOR HER CONNECTION WITH THE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE KORAN
WHEREUPON HE DREW NEAR TO HER AND BENT HIM FORWARDS AND CLAPPED PALMS.[FN#173 BUT HE WAS CONFOUNDED BY HER BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS
BUT NEEDS MUST THOU DO MY BIDDING IN ALL I SHALL DIRECT FOR WHOSO BE FIRMLY SET ON THE OBJECT OF HIS DESIRE SHALL SURELY COMPASS HIS DESIRE BY THE VIRTUE OF THE MESSIAH REPLIED HE I WILL NOT CROSS THEE IN AUGHT THOU SHALT SAY THEN QUOTH SHE BRING ME A NUMBER OF HAND MAIDS HIGH BOSOMED VIRGINS AND SUMMON THE WISE MEN OF THE AGE AND LET THEM TEACH THEM PHILOSOPHY AND THE RULES OF BEHAVIOUR BEFORE KINGS AND THE ART OF CONVERSATION AND MAKING VERSES
IT WAS THE HOLY MAN WHO TOLD US THAT HE HAD MET MY BROTHER BAHRAM AND RUSTAM AND HAD SENT THEM BOTH TO YOU AND HE ALSO ASSURED US THAT THE INFIDELS HAD ENCOMPASSED YOU AND OUT NUMBERED YOU
WHEN THEY LEFT THE HAMMAM THEY PUT ON THE NEW CLOTHES AND SHE ABODE WITH THEM THREE DAYS FEEDING THEM WITH CHICKEN MEATS AND BOUILLIS AND MAKING THEM DRINK SHERBERT OF SUGAR CANDY
AND FOR THE HIGH ESTEEM IN WHICH SHE WAS HELD OF OUR MISTRESS SHE HATH BURIED HER IN HER OWN PALACE
AND DREW TOGETHER AND WITHDREW
HERE BLEW ON THEM THE BREEZES OF BAGHDAD AND ZAU AL-MAKAN BETHOUGHT HIM OF HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND NATIVE LAND AND HOW HE WAS RETURNING TO HIS SIRE WITHOUT HIS SISTER
BUT MY FAULT IS ONE THOU DIDST FOREORDAIN TO ME FROM ETERNITY WITHOUT BEGINNING;[FN#357 SO DO THOU PARDON MY TRANSGRESSION FOR INDEED I DISOBEYED THEE OF MY IGNORANCE WHEN HE HAD MADE AN END OF HIS PRAYER HE RECITED ALOUD THE VERSE O TRUE BELIEVERS SAVE YOUR SOULS AND THOSE OF YOUR FAMILIES FROM THE FIRE WHOSE FUEL IS MEN AND STONES.'[FN#358 THEN I HEARD A FALL BUT NOT KNOWING WHAT IT WAS I PASSED ON
THEN SHE WENT AWAY BEARING HIS HEART WITH HER
A BRANCH WHICH FOLDS YOU IN ITS WAVING FOLD
SO THE NAZARENES AND THE COHORTS OF THE CROSS BURST FORTH AND UNSHEATHED THEIR KEEN SABRES IN THEIR NUMBERS SHOUTING OUT THEIR PROFESSIONS OF IMPIETY AND HERESIES AND BLASPHEMING THE LORD OF ALL CREATURES
SMITE THE CHILDREN OF DENIAL AND DISOBEDIENCE WITH THE BLANCH OF SWORD AND THE BROWN OF SPEAR SO THE MOSLEMS RETURNED TO THE INFIDELS AND PLIED THEM WITH THE KEEN EDGED SCYMITAR WHILST THEIR HERALD CRIED ALOUD UP AND AT THE FOES OF THE FAITH ALL YE WHO LOVE THE PROPHET ELECT WITH HOPE OF SALVATION ON THE DAY OF FEAR TO WIN FAVOUR OF THE BOUNTIFUL THE FORGIVING ONE
NOW THE INCENSE WHICH HE DESIGNATED WAS THE EXCREMENT OF THE CHIEF PATRIARCH THE DENIER THE DEFILER OF THE TRUTH AND THEY SOUGHT FOR IT WITH SUCH INSTANCE AND THEY SO HIGHLY VALUED IT THAT THE HIGH PRIESTS OF THE GREEKS USED TO SEND IT TO ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE CHRISTIANS IN SILKEN WRAPS AFTER MIXING IT WITH MUSK AND AMBERGRIS
IT IS SAID THAT THERE IS NO WEALTH MORE PROFITABLE THAN UNDERSTANDING AND THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING LIKE COMMON SENSE AND PRUDENCE AND THERE IS NO PRUDENCE LIKE PIETY
SHE EXPRESSED HER PITY WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE DEATH AND HER EYES RAN OVER WITH TEARS AND SHE CLAPS HAND ON HAND AND CRIED OUT HER YOUTH WAS LOST ON ALLAH'S WAY,[FN#532 AND MAY THE LORD BLESS THEE FOR HER GOOD WORKS
972 GIVES THE TRANSLATION OF AN EPISTLE BY MOHAMMED TO THIS MUKAUKIS WRITTEN IN THE CUFIC CHARACTER

IT IS ALSO SAID IT BEHOVETH NOT THE SERVANT TO NEGLECT THANKING ALLAH ESPECIALLY FOR TWO FAVOURS HEALTH AND REASON AGAIN IT IS SAID WHOSO HONOURETH HIMSELF HIS LUST IS A LIGHT MATTER TO HIM AND HE WHO MAKETH MUCH OF HIS SMALL TROUBLES ALLAH AFFLICTETH HIM WITH THE GREATER
FOR WHICH SEE D'HERBELOT S.V
THE BROKER OPENED THE DOOR OF SALE AT THE SUM NAMED AND AS HE WAS YET CALLING LO
BUT AS REGARDS THE FUGITIVE INFIDELS THEY SOON REACHED CONSTANTINOPLE WHITHER THE TIDINGS PRECEDED THEM THAT KING AFRIDUN HAD PREVAILED OVER THE MOSLEMS
THEN SHU'AYB HIRED MOSES FOR EIGHT PILGRIMAGES THAT IS TO SAY EIGHT YEARS AND MADE HIS WAGE MARRIAGE WITH ONE OF HIS TWO DAUGHTERS AND MOSES SERVICE TO HIM WAS TO STAND FOR HER DOWRY
AND HEAD FLEW FROM BODY OF MAN WHILE THE GOOD ANGELS HOVERED ABOVE THE PEOPLE OF THE CHOSEN PROPHET NOR DID THE SWORD CEASE TO SMITE TILL THE DAY DARKENED AND NIGHT CAME ON AND STARKENED
IMR AL-KEYS MU'ALLAKAH V
AN THOU JOY SLUMBER IN THOSE HOURS WHEN I PEEL TWIXT MY SIDE AND COUCH COALS BURNING SMART
FEAR NEITHER SWAY OF SWORD NOR LUNGE OF LANCE THEREUPON THE OLD MAN DISMOUNTED AND TAKING THE CROSS FROM HIS NECK PLACED IT BEFORE THE SULTAN AND HUMBLED HIMSELF WITH MUCH HUMILITY
SO TELL ME AGAINST WHOM DIDST THOU TRANSGRESS AND WHO IS IT HATH A CLAIM ON THEE BY ALLAH O FISHERMAN REPLIED NUR AL-DIN THERE BEFEL ME AND THIS DAMSEL A WONDROUS TALE AND A MARVELLOUS MATTER

AND HE ANSWERED O MY BROTHER
113 FN#215 ARAB
WHEN MORNING DAWNED THE STOKER[FN#235 OF THE BATH CAME TO HIS WORK AND FINDING ZAU AL-MAKAN CAST ON HIS BACK EXCLAIMED WHY DID THEY NOT THROW THEIR DEAD BODY ANYWHERE BUT HERE SO SAYING HE GAVE HIM A KICK AND HE MOVED
HERE ARE MY DAFTARS AND ACCOUNT BOOKS SHOWING BOTH INCOME AND OUTLAY AND THE REGISTERS OF THINE ORIGINAL PROPERTY WHEN NUR AL-DIN HEARD THESE WORDS HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND SAID THERE IS NO MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH WHEN THE MAN WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM PRIVILY TO SPY ON HIM HEARD THE STEWARD'S WORDS HE RETURNED TO HIS FRIENDS AND WARNED THEM SAYING LOOK YE WELL TO WHAT YE DO
RECEIVE THOU THE TESTIMONY OF COMPETENT MOSLEM WITNESSES ONE AGAINST OTHER FOR ALMIGHTY ALLAH HATH COMMANDED JUDGES TO JUDGE BY EXTERNALS HE HIMSELF TAKING CHARGE OF THE INNER AND SECRET THINGS
HE ABODE WITH THEM IN THIS STATE FOR A MONTH WHILST SICKNESS AND WEAKLINESS GREW UPON HIM
AND HAD NOT MY STEED STUMBLED WITH ME THOU SHOULDST HAVE SEEN MY MIGHT AND PROWESS IN COMBAT SHARRKAN SMILED AT HER SPEECH AND SAID PRAISE BE TO ALLAH FOR SAFETY AND FOR MY REUNION WITH THEE O QUEEN OF THE AGE THEN SHE CRIED OUT TO HER DAMSELS TO LOOSE THE TWENTY CAPTIVES OF SHARRKAN'S TROOP AND DISMOUNT
AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY SHE ROSE AND TAKING A PURSE OF GOLD PIECES SAID TO ME COME SHOW ME HER TOMB THAT I MAY VISIT IT AND GRAVE SOME VERSES THEREON AND BUILD A DOME OVER IT AND COMMEND HER TO ALLAH'S MERCY AND BESTOW THESE DINERS IN ALMS FOR HER SOUL I REPLIED TO HEAR IS TO OBEY
FOR A LAND ELSE THAN THIS LAND THOU MAY'ST REACH MY BROTHER BUT THY LIFE THO'LT NE'ER FIND IN THIS WORLD ANOTHER.'"[FN#39 O ALAM AL-DIN WHAT CHEER ASKED NUR AL-DIN AND HE ANSWERED RISE QUICKLY AND FLY FOR THY LIFE THOU AND THE DAMSEL
HENCE HIS IDEAL OF GENEROSITY IS OF THE VERY HIGHEST
I UNDERSTAND IT AS EXCUSABLE LOVE WHICH FOR WANT OF A BETTER TERM IS HERE TRANSLATED PLATONIC IT IS HOWEVER MORE LIKE THE OLD BUNDLING OF WALES AND NORTHERN ENGLAND
SO THEY CAME IN AND WITH THEM AL-AHNAF SON OF KAYS.[FN#267 THEN QUOTH MU'AWIYAH ENTER O ABU BAHR AND DREW A CURTAIN BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MAYSUN THAT SHE MIGHT HEAR WHAT THEY SAID WITHOUT BEING SEEN HERSELF
FN#95 AS BUKHAYT TELLS US HE LOST ONLY HIS TESTES CONSEQUENTLY HIS ERECTIO ET DISTENSIO PENIS WAS AS THAT OF A BOY BEFORE PUBERTY AND IT WOULD LAST AS LONG AS HIS HEART AND CIRCULATION KEPT SOUND
THEREUPON KING SHARRKAN AND HIS HUNDRED RIDERS TOOK HORSE AND RODE FORTH TO THE PLAIN WHERE THEY FOUND THE FRANKS RANGED IN LINE OF BATTLE
THE HERO OF THE ROMANCE AL-DALHAMAH IS DESCRIBED AS A BITTER GOURD COLOCYNTH A VIPER A CALAMITY
BUT HAST THOU PATIENCE TO BEAR PARTING FROM THY PARENTS AND THY PEOPLE EVEN SO SHE ANSWERED
IN EGYPT THE FAVOURITE IS A CHAIR-LIKE MACHINE CALLED NORAG RUNNING ON IRON PLATES AND DRAWN BY BULLS OR COWS OVER THE CORN
AND SHE CEASED NOT WALKING TO THE PALACE GATE WHERE SHE FOUND ZAU AL-MAKAN WITH CAMELS READY FOR MARCHING
I WILL RECOMPENSE HIM WHENAS I RETURN FROM THIS RAID AND FIND TIME SO TO DO THEREWITH SHARRKAN WAS CERTIFIED THAT HIS SISTER NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN HAD TOLD HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH
SO HE SAID TO HIM TELL ME THY STORY WITH HER WHO OWNED THESE GAZELLES REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN
ABYSSINIANS NUBIANS AND TAKRURIS;[FN#31 TARTARS GEORGIANS AND OTHERS
SO THEY LOOKED AND LO
OUT ON THEE AND TALK NOT THUS IN MY PRESENCE AND KNOW THAT I WILL NEVER CONSENT TO WHAT THOU SAYEST THOUGH I DRINK THE CUP OF DEATH
THEN SHE CROWNED A SECOND AND HANDED IT TO HIM
SHAYKH IBRAHIM CARRIED THEM UP INTO THE PAVILION AND THEY GAZED ON ITS BEAUTY AND ON THE LAMPS AFOREMENTIONED IN THE LATTICED WINDOWS
THEN I GAVE MYSELF WHOLLY UP TO HER AND PAID HER FREQUENT VISITS
AND BEYOND IT LAY A BOWER OF TRELLICED BOUGHS GROWING FRUITS SINGLE AND COMPOSITE AND SMALL BIRDS ON BRANCHES SANG WITH MELODIOUS RECITE AND THE THOUSAND-NOTED NIGHTINGALE SHRILLED WITH HER VARIED SHRIGHT
110 AND ELSEWHERE FOR THE ROMANTIC AND PICTURESQUE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT BELIEF
TEARS STREAMED FROM HIS EYES FOR EXCESS OF JOY AND HE REPEATED THESE COUPLETS,[FN#320 LONG I LAMENTED THAT WE FELL APART WHILE TEARS REPENTANT RAILED FROM THESE EYNE
BUT AS REGARDS WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS SISTER NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN WHEN SHE LEFT HER BROTHER IN THE KHAN WHERE THEY ABODE AND WRAPPED IN THE OLD CAMLET WENT OUT TO SEEK SERVICE WITH SOME ONE THAT SHE MIGHT EARN WHEREWITHAL TO BUY HIM THE ROAST MEAT HE LONGED FOR SHE FARED ON WEEPING AND KNOWING NOT WHITHER TO GO WHILST HER MIND WAS OCCUPIED WITH THOUGHTS OF HER BROTHER AND OF HER FAMILY AND HER NATIVE LAND
THEN SHE LET DOWN HER HAIR OVER HER FACE AND SET THE LAMP ON THE POT OF FLOWERS DURING THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
WHY SHOULD I NOT SIT WITH THEM
FN#502 ARAB
AND HE ANSWERED HER AND HOW FARED IT WITH THEE IN THE HOUSE QUOTH THEY WE WERE ALL WELL WHOLE AND HEALTHY NOR HATH AUGHT OF EVIL BEFALLEN US IN THE HOUSE SAVE THAT THY SLAVE KAFUR CAME TO US BAREHEADED WITH TORN GARMENTS AND HOWLING ALAS THE MASTER
WHO DURST DO A DEED LIKE THIS EXCEPT THE CALIPHATE HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM ME QUOTH JA'AFAR AND INDEED HIS SIDE-MUSCLES TREMBLED AS HE SPOKE WHO TOLD THEE THAT THE PALACE OF PICTURES WAS ILLUMINATED AND THE WINDOWS THROWN OPEN COME HITHER AND SEE REPLIED THE CALIPH
WHEN THEY SEIZED ME FOR THE ROYAL TREASURY AS BEING THE PROPERTY OF AN INTESTATE AND I FOUND MY WAY HITHER WHERE I BECAME YOUR COMRADE
IT IS THE OLDER MORGIANA I DO NOT SEE WHY PRESTON IN AL-HARINI'S MAKAMAH SEANCE OF SINGAR RENDERS IT PEARLS BECAUSE GOLIUS GIVES SMALL PEARLS WHEN IT IS EVIDENTLY CORAL RICHARDSON DISSERT
THEN THE SUN YELLOWED AND THE MU'EZZINS[FN#496 CHANTED THE CALL TO SUNDOWN PRAYER AND THE NIGHT CAME
THEN HE TOOK SHAYKH IBRAHIM'S HAND AND KISSED IT
THEN HE RETURNED TO THE LITTER AND RELATED THE GOOD HE HAD DONE AND NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN SAID TO HIM BID THE EUNUCH BRING ME THE FIREMAN AND GIVE HIM A HORSE TO RIDE AND RATION HIM WITH A TRAY OF FOOD MORNING AND EVENING AND LET HIM BE FORBIDDEN TO LEAVE US THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED THE CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO ACCORDINGLY
HE WHO EXCEEDETH IN CONTENTION SINNETH AND HE WHO AGAINST UPRIGHT STANDETH NOT ON WARD IS NOT SAFE FROM THE SWORD
THEN THEY DRANK AND GAVE HIM TO DRINK AND CEASED NOT THEIR CAROUSAL TILL A THIRD PART OF THE NIGHT WAS PAST
THE DICTIONARIES DEFINE THE SUBSTANCE AS A STONE FROM WHICH ANTIMONY IS PREPARED BUT THE ARABS UNDERSTAND A SEMI-MYTHICAL MINERAL OF YELLOW COLOUR WHICH ENTERS INTO THE VEINS OF THE EYES AND GIVES THEM IYNX-LIKE VISION
THOU DIDST AS WHILOM MANY A DOER LIKE THEE HATH DONE LEFTEST THIS WORLDLY HOUSE WITHOUT REPROACH OR BLAME
IT IS APPLIED TO VISITING MECCAH AND GOING THROUGH ALL THE PILGRIM-RITES BUT NOT AT THE PILGRIMAGE-SEASON
THEN SHE SET ON THE DRINKING VESSELS AND LIGHTED THE CANDLES AND ORDERED TO BRING DRIED FRUITS AND SWEET MEATS AND ALL THAT PERTAINETH TO DRINKING
THE POETS CALL THIS YAUM-I-ALAST = THE DAY OF AM-I-NOT YOUR LORD
THEN HE AROSE AND BARING HIS BRAND LOOKED RIGHT AND LEFT BUT HE SAW NO ONE SAVE THE OLD WOMAN SPRAWLING ON HER BACK AND SAID TO HIMSELF HE LIED NOT WHO NAMED THEE LADY OF CALAMITIES
NEAR ALL THESE WAS A LARGE TRAY OF SILVER COVERED OVER AND WHEN I UNCOVERED IT I FOUND THEREIN FRUITS OF EVERY KIND FIGS AND POMEGRANATES GRAPES AND ORANGES CITRONS AND SHADDOCKS[FN#501 DISPOSED AMONGST AN INFINITE VARIETY OF SWEET SCENTED FLOWERS SUCH AS ROSE JASMINE MYRTLE EGLANTINE NARCISSUS AND ALL SORTS OF SWEET SMELLING HERBS
WOE TO THEE QUOTH THE SULTAN AND INDEED HE WAS SORE ANGERED

ASK WHAT THOU WILT OF ME O KUT AL-KULUB O PRINCE OF THE FAITHFUL ANSWERED SHE I REQUIRE OF THEE ONLY MY BELOVED GHANIM SON OF AYYUB HE DID AS SHE DESIRED WHEREUPON SHE SAID O LORD OF THE MOSLEMS IF I BRING HIM TO THY PRESENCE WILT THOU BESTOW ME ON HIM
OF A TOWN
FN#460 POISON KING PERSIAN
NEEDS MUST I FOLLOW OUT THE HOLY WAR THOUGH I WONE MANY A YEAR IN THEIR COUNTRY
SO WHEN I DESPAIRED OF SEEING HER AGAIN I ROSE FROM MY PLACE AND TAKING UP THE HANDKERCHIEF OPENED IT WHEN THERE BREATHED FROM IT A SCENT OF MUSK WHICH CAUSED ME SO GREAT DELIGHT I BECAME AS ONE IN PARADISE.[FN#484 THEN I SPREAD IT BEFORE ME AND OUT DROPPED FROM IT A DELICATE LITTLE SCROLL
FARJ
SO AJAX FELL ON HIS BACK WITH ULYSSES ON HIS BREAST

THE NATIVE SULTANS OF DARFUR LIKE THOSE OF BORNU AND OTHERS FURTHER WEST USED WHITE MUSLIN AS A FACE-WRAP
WHEN SHE ANSWERED TONIGHT I WILL TELL THEE MY TALE THAT THOU MAYST ACCEPT MY EXCUSE THEN SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND WINDING HER ARMS LIKE A NECKLACE ABOUT HIS NECK KISSED HIM AND CARESSED HIM AND PROMISED HIM HER FAVOURS
THESE BE MERCHANTMEN FROM THE LAND OF SHAM WHO HAVE BEEN WITH US
HO THOU WHO FORCEST FORTALICE AND OVERTHROWEST CITIES AND COUNTRIES

THE PERSIANS WHO HATE HIM CALL HIM PIR-I-KAFTAR THE OLD SHE-HYAENA AND BELIEVE THAT HE WANDERS ABOUT THE DESERTS OF ARABIA IN PERPETUAL RUT WHICH THE MALES MUST SATISFY
THAT I MIGHT TAKE THEE AND CARRY THEE TO HER TO BEAR HER COMPANY SO AS TO DIVERT HER FROM PINING FOR HER SISTERS
WE CANNOT SPEAK TO THEE ALL OF US THEN QUOTH NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND THE FOUR KAZIS HERE ENDETH THE SECOND SECTION OF THE FIRST CHAPTER."--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
BY THE MESSIAH AND THE TRUE FAITH SAID HE I WILL NOT DESIST TILL I HAVE TAKEN MY BLOOD VENGEANCE FOR THIS AND HAVE WIPED OUT MY SHAME
THEY MADE ALL HASTE OVER THEIR WAYFARE TILL THEY REACHED A PLACE DISTANT A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM BAGHDAD WHERE THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED A HALT FOR REST AND BADE HIS MEN ALIGHT AND MAKE READY A SITTING PLACE FOR THE SULTAN ZAU AL-MAKAN SON OF KING OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN WHILE HE RODE FORWARD WITH HIS MAMELUKES AND ALIGHTING AT A DISTANCE FROM NUZHAT AL-ZAMAN'S LITTER COMMANDED THE EUNUCHS TO ASK LEAVE OF ADMISSION TO THE PRESENCE
FN#332 ALL THIS IS KORANIC CHAPS
SHARRKAN WALKED IN TO HIS FATHER WHO ROSE AND EMBRACED HIM AND QUESTIONED HIM OF HIS CASE
IF THOU THROW ME SET ME ON THY STEED AND TAKE ALL OF US TO THY BOOTY
BUT THIS IS NOT SATISFACTORY
THEN HE TOOK OUT WHAT HE NEEDED AND SET IT ON AND POURED THE WINE INTO FLAGONS AND GLASS EWERS WHILST SHAYKH IBRAHIM BROUGHT THEM FRUIT AND FLOWERS AND AROMATIC HERBS
FOR O MY MISTRESS BY ALLAH THOU HAST NOT GRASSED ME BY THY STRENGTH BUT BY THE BLANDISHMENTS OF THY BACK PARTS
WHEN IT WAS THE NINETY-SIXTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SHARRKAN AND HIS BROTHER ZAU AL-MAKAN AND THE WAZIR DANDAN SET OFF WITH AN HUNDRED HORSE FOR THE HERMITAGE DESCRIBED TO THEM BY THAT ACCURSED ZAT AL-DAWAHI AND THEY TOOK WITH THEM MULES AND CHESTS FOR TRANSPORTING THE TREASURE

FN#197 THE GENERAL COLOUR OF CHESSMEN IN THE EAST WHERE THE GAME IS PLAYED ON A CLOTH MORE OFTEN THAN A BOARD
IN VERY SOOTH I LOVE NOT TO PART WITH THEE THEN SHE CALLED DOWN BLESSINGS ON HIM AND DEPARTED WITH THE FIVE DAMSELS AND THE QUEEN
AND MATTERS CEASED NOT TO BE ON THIS WISE AND I CONTINUED FOR A WHOLE YEAR EATING AND DRINKING AND ENJOYING DALLIANCE AND WEARING CHANGE OF RICH RAIMENT UNTIL I WAXED GROSS AND FAT SO THAT I LOST ALL THOUGHT OF SORROWING AND MOURNING AND I CLEAN FORGOT MY COUSIN AZIZAH
THEN THE STOKER SOLD HIS GOODS AND HIS WIFE'S GEAR AND BOUGHT A CAMEL AND HIRED AN ASS FOR ZAU AL-MAKAN
BUT SEEING THE FISHERMAN BECOME THE CALIPH SHAYKH IBRAHIM WAS UTTERLY CONFOUNDED AND HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT BITE HIS FINGER ENDS[FN#65 AND SAY WOULD I KNEW WHETHER AM I ASLEEP OR AM I AWAKE AT LAST THE CALIPH LOOKED AT HIM AND CRIED O SHAYKH IBRAHIM WHAT STATE IS THIS IN WHICH I SEE THEE THEREUPON HE RECOVERED FROM HIS DRUNKENNESS AND THROWING HIMSELF UPON THE GROUND REPEATED THESE VERSES PARDON THE SINFUL WAYS I DID PURSUE
MOREOVER THE LION OF THE FAITH KING SHARRKAN AND HIS BROTHER ZAU AL-MAKAN SLEPT NOT THAT NIGHT BUT OCCUPIED THEMSELVES WITH CONGRATULATING THEIR BRAVES AND WITH LOOKING TO THE WOUNDED AND WITH ASSURING THE ARMY OF VICTORY AND SALVATION AND PROMISE OF REWARD IN THE WORLD TO COME
AND ALLAH MADE IT EASY TO HER AND SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SECOND CHILD
HE WAS GIRT WITH TWO SWORDS HIS GLANCES AND HIS BRAND AND HE WAS ARMED WITH TWO LANCES ONE OF BAMBOO CANE AND THE OTHER HIS STRAIGHT WAND LIKE SHAPE

AT THIS HE EXCLAIMED THERE IS NO MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH
WHEN THE OLD WOMAN PUSHED ME FORWARDS I FOUND MYSELF ERE I COULD THINK INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

THE OLDEST MONASTERY IN THE WORLD IS MAR ANTONIOS ST ANTHONY THE HERMIT NOT FAR FROM SUEZ

MINE EARS ARE DULL AND LOST TO SENSE
FOR INSTANCE IN THE WITTY PERSIAN BOOK DOZD O KAZI THE THIEF AND THE JUDGE A FOOTPAD STRIPS THE MAN OF LEARNING AND OFFERS TO RETURN HIS CLOTHES IF HE CAN ASK HIM A PUZZLE IN LAW OR RELIGION

THE MOSLEM HAREM IS A GREAT SCHOOL FOR THIS LESBIAN WHICH I WOULD CALL ATOSSAN LOVE

FAR BETTER DENY HIM THAN COME TO SAY:--LEND AND FIVE-FOLD THE LOAN SHALL RETURN TO THY HAND

WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF SHE WIPED AWAY THE TEARS AND BLOOD FROM HER FACE
FOR IF THEY TAKE HIM INTO THE HOSPITAL THEY WILL KILL HIM IN A SINGLE DAY."[FN#131 THEN HE MADE HIS YOUNG MEN CARRY HIM TO HIS HOUSE WHERE THEY SPREAD HIM A NEW BED WITH A NEW PILLOW,[FN#132 AND HE SAID TO HIS WIFE TEND HIM CAREFULLY AND SHE REPLIED GOOD
THESE ARE FAVOURITE PLACES FOR WILD BEASTS DURING NOON-HEATS
BUT REGARDING THE WORK OF THE OLD WOMAN ZAT AL-DAWAHI
AT THIS GHANIM REJOICED AND KEPT SELLING HIS SILKS AND STUFFS ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND CEASED NOT TO DO ON THIS WISE FOR A FULL YEAR
AND HER BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS WERE THEREBY REDOUBLED
THE CONVERSE OF THIS WAS REPORTED AT PARIS DURING THE EMPIRE WHEN A MAN HAD BY MISTAKE PINCHED A VERY HIGH PERSONAGE

DESIRE FOR EVER FIRES AND TEARS TO ALL PROCLAIM WHAT I WOULD KEEP IN SECRECY NO CUNNING SHIFT IS KNOWN TO ME A MEETING TO SECURE THAT I MAY QUIT THIS SICKLY STATE MAY CURE MY MALADY
SO SHE TURNED TO HIM AND SAID BY THE TRUTH OF THE MESSIAH THE CASE IS NOT ON SUCH WISE NOR IS THERE AUGHT IN THIS MEAT OF WHAT THOU SUSPECTEST
THEN SHARRKAN TURNED TO HIS ATTENDANTS AND SAID BEGIN YE TO PREPARE THE MARRIAGE FESTIVAL AND MAKE READY FOOD OF ALL KINDS SO THEY FORTHRIGHT DID HIS BIDDING AS REGARDS THE VIANDS AND HE COMMANDED THE WIVES OF THE EMIRS AND WAZIRS AND GRANDEES DEPART NOT UNTIL THE TIME OF THE WEDDING BANQUET AND OF THE UNVEILING OF THE BRIDE
I AM FOULLY WRONGED SO THEY BROUGHT HIM BEFORE THE KING WHO LOOKED AT HIM
AND THAT DAY WERE SLAIN OF THEM FIVE AND FORTY
THERE IS NO MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT
THEREUPON THE BROKER WENT ROUND TO THE MERCHANTS BUT FOUND THAT ALL HAD NOT YET ASSEMBLED
HERE ALSO THEY HALTED THREE DAYS AND THENCE THEY TRAVELLED TILL THEY ENTERED THE PROVINCE DIYAR BAKR
SO I FELL SICK AND MY COUSIN ALSO SICKENED ON MY ACCOUNT
HER EARS WERE ADORNED WITH PENDANTS OF PEARLS AND ON HER HEAD SHE WORE A KERCHIEF[FN#528 OF BROCADE BRAND NEW AND BROIDERED WITH JEWELS OF PRICE
AND THOUGH YE TARRY HERE YEARS AND YEARS YE SHALL NOT DO YOUR DESIRE ON US
IT IS SAID THAT THE IMAM AL-SHAFI'I DEPARTED THE NIGHT INTO THREE PORTIONS THE FIRST FOR STUDY THE SECOND FOR SLEEP AND THE THIRD FOR PRAYER
I WILL BE THY SERVANT QUOTH ZAU AL-MAKAN THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT THOU RIDE AWHILE TIS WELL QUOTH THE STOKER
WERE A KAZI TO SWEAR ME EVEN THOUGH HE WERE A KAZI OF THE KAZIS,[FN#171 HE WOULD NOT IMPOSE UPON ME SUCH AN OATH AS THIS THEN HE SWARE TO HER BY ALL SHE NAMED AND TIED HIS STEED TO A TREE
BUT HIS MOTHER RAN TO THE YOUTH'S SUCCOUR AND ASKED HER HUSBAND WHAT WOULDEST THOU DO WITH HIM HE ANSWERED HER I WILL SPLIT HIS WEASAND SAID THE SON TO THE FATHER IS MY DEATH THEN SO LIGHT A MATTER TO THEE
AT LAST WHEN MORNING AROSE WITH ITS SHEEN AND SHINE I WENT OUT TO SEEK HER AND HASTENING TO HER BY STREET SAT DOWN ON THAT BENCH WHEN LO
BARZOI KALILAH AND DIMNAH SAYS MAN'S SEED FALLING INTO THE WOMAN'S WOMB IS MIXED WITH HER SEED AND HER BLOOD
THEN O JUDGE THOU SHOULDEST STUDY PRECEDENTS AND THE LAW OF THE CASE AND DO EQUAL JUSTICE BETWEEN THE SUITORS WITHAL FIXING THINE EYES UPON THE TRUTH AND COMMITTING THINE AFFAIR TO ALLAH BE HE EXTOLLED AND EXALTED AND REQUIRE THOU PROOF OF THE COMPLAINANT AND IF HE ADDUCE EVIDENCE LET HIM HAVE DUE BENEFIT OF IT
WHILE EVERY ONE WHO DREW NEAR TO HIM WISHED THAT TAJ AL-MULUK KHARAN MIGHT BECOME SULTAN AFTER HIS FATHER'S DEATH AND THAT HE HIMSELF MIGHT BE ONE OF HIS EMIRS
FOR OF A TRUTH MY HEART BURNETH TO SEE THEE SINCE I FIRST SET EYES ON THEE."[FN#477 THEN TAJ AL-MULUK BADE THE SEATS BE SET AND THEY BROUGHT HIM A CHAIR OF IVORY AND EBONY WITH A NET WORK OF GOLD AND SILK AND SPREAD HIM A SILKEN RUG FOR HIS FEET
AL-WAKKAD THE MAN WHO LIGHTS AND KEEPS UP THE BATH-FIRES
BUT IF THESE BE NAZARENES THERE IS NO GAINSAYING DESTINY'S DECREES THEN HE TURNED TO HIS BROTHER ZAU AL MAKAN AND SAID NEVER FEAR FOR WITH MY LIFE I WILL RANSOM THEE FROM DEATH
SO THEY WILL FALL ON ONE ANOTHER BRAND IN HAND DURING THE CONFUSION OF DRUNKENNESS AND SLEEP AND WE WILL CLEAVE THEM ASUNDER WITH THEIR OWN SWORDS AND THE SCYMITAR WILL GO ROUND AMONGST THEM TILL DAWN REPLIED ZAU AL-MAKAN THIS PLAN IS NOT GOOD
HIS EYES ROLLED IN RAGE AND HE LOOKED AT NUZHAT AL ZAMAN AND SAID TO HER WHENCE HADST THOU THIS JEWEL O SLAVE GIRL WHEN SHE HEARD THIS FROM SHARRKAN SHE REPLIED I AM THY LADY AND THE LADY OF ALL IN THY PALACE
I AM AFRIDUN THE OVERWHELMED BY THE WELL OMENED SHAWAHI,[FN#448 ZAT AL-DAWAHI BUT HE HAD NOT ENDED SPEAKING ERE SHARRKAN THE CHAMPION OF THE MOSLEMS FARED FORTH TO MEET HIM MOUNTED ON A SORREL HORSE WORTH A THOUSAND PIECES OF RED GOLD WITH ACCOUTREMENTS PURFLED IN PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONE

DURING THE CALIPHATE THE WINE-SERVICE WAS ON A LARGER SCALE
HIS CANTILOQUIUM IS FAMOUS AND HE HAS LEFT MORE THAN ONE MYSTICAL AND PROPHETIC WORK
AS WILL BE SEEN HOWEVER THE RULE IS NOT INVARIABLY KEPT AND HARDLY EVER IN BADAWI POETRY

NOW THIS WAS THE ARMY OF KING HARDUB PRINCESS ABRIZAH'S FATHER AND THE CAUSE OF HIS COMING WAS THAT WHEN HE HEARD OF HIS DAUGHTER AND HER HANDMAIDS HAVING FLED TO BAGHDAD AND THAT THEY WERE WITH KING OMAR BIN AL NU'UMAN HE HAD COME FORTH LEADING THOSE WITH HIM TO SEEK TIDINGS OF HER FROM TRAVELLERS WHO MIGHT HAVE SEEN HER WITH THE KING

SO I TOOK THE KERCHIEF AND THE SCROLL AND WENT HOME KNOWING NO MEANS TO WIN MY WISH FOR THAT I WAS INCAPABLE OF CONDUCTING LOVE AFFAIRS AND INEXPERIENCED IN INTERPRETING HINTS AND TOKENS
THEN HE DESPATCHED A COMPANY OF HIS COMPANIONS TO BAGHDAD TO ACQUAINT HIS FATHER OMAR BIN AL-NU'UMAN WITH HIS ARRIVAL AND REPORT THAT HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY PRINCESS ABRIZAH DAUGHTER OF KING HARDUB LORD OF GRAECIA-LAND
FN#248 THIS I HAVE NOTED IS ACCORDING TO KORANIC COMMAND CHAPS

FOR THEY ARE ENDOWED WITH WIT AND BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS AND PERFECTION
THEN SHE BEGAN CARESSING HIM WHICH MADE HIS LOVE WAX HOTTER TILL IT GOT THE MASTERY OF HIS HEART
I WELL REMEMBER THE WEEPING AND WAILING THROUGHOUT SIND WHEN AN ORDER FROM SIR CHARLES NAPIER SET FREE THE NEGROES WHOM BRITISH PHILANTHROPY THUS DOOMED TO ENDURE IF NOT TO DIE OF HUNGER
NOW WHEN I KICKED THE DAUGHTER OF MY UNCLE IN THE BREAST SHE FELL ON THE EDGE OF THE RAISED PAVEMENT IN THE SALOON AND HER BROW STRUCK UPON A WOODEN PEG
HEREAT THEY DRIED THEIR TEARS IN OBEDIENCE TO HER BIDDING AND SHE SAID KNOW YE BOTH THAT I WAS CONTENT TO ACCEPT WHAT MY LORD DID UNTO ME FOR I KENNED THAT THE AFFLICTION WHICH BEFEL ME WAS A TRIAL FROM HIM BE HE EXALTED AND EXTOLLED
ADOBE WITH CHAFF AND BRUISED OR CHARRED STRAW
SO HE BEGAN AS FOLLOWS THE TALE OF THE FIRST EUNUCH BUKHAYT
THAT ACCURSED ONE PLAYED ME FALSE
HARDLY HAD HE MADE AN END OF HIS VERSES AND COME TO A CONCLUSION WHEN THE EUNUCH WHO HAD HEARD HIM FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AT HIS HEAD CAME UP TO HIM
AND MAKING HIM DISMOUNT FROM HIS BEAST SEATED HIM IN THE SHOP OF THE SYNDIC OF THE MARKET TO WHOM HE DELIVERED THE PACKAGE
THE WISE WHEN HE EXERCISETH HIS OWN JUDGEMENT
FN#51 THE ASS IS HELD TO BE ILL-OMENED
THEN SHE FURNISHED HIM WITH WINE AND MEDICINES AND SHE SAT AWHILE BY HIS HEAD AFTER WHICH SHE MOUNTED AND RETURNED TO HER PALACE AND CONTINUED TO VISIT EVERY BAZAR IN QUEST OF HER LOVER
THE HIGH MINDED TAMIN IS CONTRASTED WITH THE MEAN-SPIRITED KAYS WHO ALSO GAVE RISE TO A TRIBE
THEN HE WEPT FOR EXCESS OF LONGING AND PLAINED HIM OF FORTUNE AND HER INJURIES AND THE WORLD AND ITS ENMITIES AND PRAISE BE TO HIM WHO CAUSETH GENEROUS HEARTS TO BE TROUBLED WITH LOVE AND THE BELOVED AND WHO ENDOWETH NOT THE MINDS OF THE MEAN AND MISERLY WITH SO MUCH OF IT AS EVENETH A GRAIN-WEIGHT SO HE BEGAN REPEATING THE LOVER'S HEART FOR HIS BELOVED MUST MEET SAD PAIN AND FROM HER CHARMS BEAR SORE DEFEAT
QUOTH THEY WHO ART THOU
WHEN THE FIREMAN WENT FORTH AND AS WAS HIS WONT BOUGHT SOME MEAT AND DRINK
THEY DID AS SHE BADE AND CAME AND KISSED THE EARTH BEFORE HER AND SHARRKAN WHO SAID TO THEM IT IS THE LIKE OF YOU THAT KINGS KEEP IN STORE FOR THE NEED HOUR THEN HE SIGNED TO HIS COMRADES TO SALUTE THE PRINCESS
NOW WHEN SHE HAD BEEN RESTORED TO HER SON THE KING OF GREECE AND FELT HERSELF SAFE SHE SAID TO KING HARDUB COOL THINE EYES
DOUBTLESS THEY ARE NOT ASSEMBLED TOGETHER AND IT MAY BE THAT THE PRAYER OF ONE OF THEM WILL WORK US WEAL BOTH IN THIS WORLD AND IN THE NEXT
