NUMEROUS MEASUREMENTS WERE CAREFULLY MADE OF THE STATURE THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE NECK AND CHEST THE LENGTH OF THE BACK-BONE AND OF THE ARMS IN VARIOUS RACES
AND AS STEALING IS A RARE CRIME IN THE WEALTHY CLASSES WE CAN HARDLY ACCOUNT BY ACCIDENTAL COINCIDENCE FOR THE TENDENCY OCCURRING IN TWO OR THREE MEMBERS OF THE SAME FAMILY
THE COURTSHIP OF ANIMALS IS BY NO MEANS SO SIMPLE AND SHORT AN AFFAIR AS MIGHT BE THOUGHT
ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE FEMALE COMMON PHEASANT WITH A TAIL MUCH LONGER THAN THAT OF THE FEMALE SOEMMERRING PHEASANT WERE CROSSED WITH THE MALE OF THE LATTER THE MALE HYBRID OFFSPRING WOULD HAVE A MUCH SHORTER TAIL THAN THAT OF THE PURE OFFSPRING OF SOEMMERRING'S PHEASANT
IT DESERVES NOTICE THAT AS SOON AS THE PROGENITORS OF MAN BECAME SOCIAL AND THIS PROBABLY OCCURRED AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD THE PRINCIPLE OF IMITATION AND REASON AND EXPERIENCE WOULD HAVE INCREASED AND MUCH MODIFIED THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS IN A WAY OF WHICH WE SEE ONLY TRACES IN THE LOWER ANIMALS

BUT WE SHALL PRESENTLY SEE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER AND MORE PROBABLE EXPLANATION NAMELY THAT CONSPICUOUS FEMALES HAVE ACQUIRED THE INSTINCT OF BUILDING DOMED NESTS OFTENER THAN DULL COLOURED BIRDS
THESE LATTER ORGANS OF INFINITELY DIVERSIFIED KINDS GRADUATE INTO THOSE WHICH ARE COMMONLY RANKED AS PRIMARY AND IN SOME CASES CAN HARDLY BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THEM

COMPTES-RENDUS DES SCIENCES ETC JUNE 1 1868 BY COMPARING THE CRANIA OF TERTIARY AND RECENT MAMMALS BELONGING TO THE SAME GROUPS HAS COME TO THE REMARKABLE CONCLUSION THAT THE BRAIN IS GENERALLY LARGER AND THE CONVOLUTIONS ARE MORE COMPLEX IN THE MORE RECENT FORMS
AND THEIR MODIFICATION IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH THE ERECT OR SEMI-ERECT ATTITUDE OF MAN AND THE ANTHROPOMORPHOUS APES
EVEN THE BRIGHT COLOURS OF MANY MALE BIRDS CANNOT FAIL TO MAKE THEM CONSPICUOUS TO THEIR ENEMIES OF ALL KINDS
IN SOME KINDS OF BABOONS THERE ARE TWENTY-FIVE WHILST IN THE MANDRILL THERE ARE TEN VERY SMALL STUNTED CAUDAL VERTEBRAE OR ACCORDING TO CUVIER 90

I ALLUDE TO DR BROWN SEQUARD'S OBSERVATIONS ON THE TRANSMITTED EFFECT OF AN OPERATION CAUSING EPILEPSY IN GUINEA-PIGS AND LIKEWISE MORE RECENTLY ON THE ANALOGOUS EFFECTS OF CUTTING THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE IN THE NECK
AND THIS IS A CONCLUSION WHICH I FOR ONE WILL NEVER ADMIT
THE COLOURING OF INSECTS IS A COMPLEX AND OBSCURE SUBJECT
DIFFERENT COMPLEXION OF MALE AND FEMALE NEGROES
FORBES INFORMS ME IS SO MUCH VALUED AS A BEAUTY THAT CUTTING IT OFF WAS THE SEVEREST PUNISHMENT WHICH HE COULD INFLICT ON THEM
THE SAME PROCESS WOULD HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED AND THE SAME DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IF IT WERE DESIRED TO MAKE A BREED WITH THE FEMALES ALONE OF SOME NEW COLOUR

ON MYCETES RENGGER IBID
ON MONSTROSITIES
TAPHRODERES DISTORTUS ENLARGED LEFT MANDIBLE OF THE MALE
IN GENERAL WE CAN ONLY SAY THAT THE CAUSE OF EACH SLIGHT VARIATION AND OF EACH MONSTROSITY LIES MUCH MORE IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANISM THAN IN THE NATURE OF THE SURROUNDING CONDITIONS
BUT IF THE MARGIN WERE TO BE THUS FOLDED A SLIGHT POINT WOULD NECESSARILY PROJECT INWARDS TOWARDS THE CENTRE AND PROBABLY A LITTLE OUTWARDS FROM THE PLANE OF THE EAR
THUS THE FEMALES AND THE YOUNG WILL EITHER HAVE BEEN LEFT UNMODIFIED OR AS IS MUCH MORE COMMON WILL HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY MODIFIED BY RECEIVING THROUGH TRANSFERENCE FROM THE MALES SOME OF HIS SUCCESSIVE VARIATIONS

207 IN THE LOWER CLASSES OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM THE GREATER SIZE OF THE FEMALES SEEMS GENERALLY TO DEPEND ON THEIR DEVELOPING AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF OVA
IN OPPOSITION TO THIS VIEW OF THE RETENTION OF THE BEARD FROM AN EARLY PERIOD IS THE FACT OF ITS GREAT VARIABILITY IN DIFFERENT RACES AND EVEN WITHIN THE SAME RACE
AND THIS APPARENTLY INDICATES THAT INVERSELY THE MALES EXCEED THE FEMALES IN THE SAME PROPORTION

104 SO IT WILL BE WITH THE INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES SINCE THE SOMEWHAT ABLER MEN IN EACH GRADE OF SOCIETY SUCCEED RATHER BETTER THAN THE LESS ABLE AND CONSEQUENTLY INCREASE IN NUMBER IF NOT OTHERWISE PREVENTED
SO IN REGARD TO MENTAL QUALITIES THEIR TRANSMISSION IS MANIFEST IN OUR DOGS HORSES AND OTHER DOMESTIC ANIMALS
BUT IT MAY PARTLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE DEGRADED AND ANOMALOUS POSITION OF THE CLASS AND BY THE PROFLIGACY OF THE WOMEN

IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FREQUENT TRANSMISSION OF CHARACTERS TO ONE SEX ALONE MR WALLACE EXPRESSES HIS BELIEF THAT THE MORE COMMON FORM OF EQUAL INHERITANCE BY BOTH SEXES CAN BE CHANGED THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION INTO INHERITANCE BY ONE SEX ALONE BUT IN FAVOUR OF THIS VIEW I CAN DISCOVER NO EVIDENCE

WE MAY THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT THE MALES HAVE ACQUIRED THEIR STRONGLY-MARKED COLOURS AND ORNAMENTAL APPENDAGES THROUGH SEXUAL SELECTION

102 SO FAR AS CEREBRAL STRUCTURE GOES THEREFORE IT IS CLEAR THAT MAN DIFFERS LESS FROM THE CHIMPANZEE OR THE ORANG THAN THESE DO EVEN FROM THE MONKEYS AND THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BRAIN OF THE CHIMPANZEE AND OF MAN IS ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT WHEN COMPARED WITH THAT BETWEEN THE CHIMPANZEE BRAIN AND THAT OF A LEMUR IN THE PAPER TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED PROFESSOR BISCHOFF DOES NOT DENY THE SECOND PART OF THIS STATEMENT BUT HE FIRST MAKES THE IRRELEVANT REMARK THAT IT IS NOT WONDERFUL IF THE BRAINS OF AN ORANG AND A LEMUR ARE VERY DIFFERENT
LASTLY THE FEMALES MAY ACQUIRE AND APPARENTLY HAVE OFTEN ACQUIRED BY TRANSFERENCE CHARACTERS FROM THE MALE SEX

THE SOLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE CASES IS THAT IN THE ONE THE RESULT IS DUE TO MAN'S SELECTION WHILST IN THE OTHER AS WITH HUMMING BIRDS BIRDS OF PARADISE ETC IT IS DUE TO THE SELECTION BY THE FEMALES OF THE MORE BEAUTIFUL MALES
IN THE GENUS PAPILIO ALL THE SPECIES OF THE AENEAS GROUP ARE REMARKABLE FOR THEIR CONSPICUOUS AND STRONGLY CONTRASTED COLOURS AND THEY ILLUSTRATE THE FREQUENT TENDENCY TO GRADATION IN THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEXES
THE RESULT SEEMS TRUSTWORTHY AND SHOWS THAT DURING THE FOURTEEN YEARS PREVIOUS TO 1858 THE DECREASE WAS 19.42 PER CENT
THE STALLION HAS A THICKER AND FULLER MANE THAN THE MARE
THIRDLY AFTER THE POWER OF LANGUAGE HAD BEEN ACQUIRED AND THE WISHES OF THE COMMUNITY COULD BE EXPRESSED THE COMMON OPINION HOW EACH MEMBER OUGHT TO ACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD WOULD NATURALLY BECOME IN A PARAMOUNT DEGREE THE GUIDE TO ACTION

WHY THESE ANIMALS AS WELL AS THE PROGENITORS OF MAN SHOULD HAVE LOST THE POWER OF ERECTING THEIR EARS WE CANNOT SAY
IN THE DIM OBSCURITY OF THE PAST WE CAN SEE THAT THE EARLY PROGENITOR OF ALL THE VERTEBRATA MUST HAVE BEEN AN AQUATIC ANIMAL PROVIDED WITH BRANCHIAE WITH THE TWO SEXES UNITED IN THE SAME INDIVIDUAL AND WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT ORGANS OF THE BODY SUCH AS THE BRAIN AND HEART IMPERFECTLY OR NOT AT ALL DEVELOPED
FOR MAN IS ENABLED THROUGH HIS MENTAL FACULTIES TO KEEP WITH AN UNCHANGED BODY IN HARMONY WITH THE CHANGING UNIVERSE HE HAS GREAT POWER OF ADAPTING HIS HABITS TO NEW CONDITIONS OF LIFE
237 SOME RACES ARE MUCH MORE HAIRY THAN OTHERS ESPECIALLY THE MALES
BUT MOST OF OUR RACES HAVE BEEN FORMED NOT INTENTIONALLY FROM A SELECTED PAIR BUT UNCONSCIOUSLY BY THE PRESERVATION OF MANY INDIVIDUALS WHICH HAVE VARIED HOWEVER SLIGHTLY IN SOME USEFUL OR DESIRED MANNER
AND ABOVE THIS LIMIT THE WHOLE UPPER END OF THE FEATHER A IS COVERED WITH WHITE DOTS SURROUNDED BY LITTLE BLACK RINGS STANDING ON A DARK GROUND
IN THE STAPHYLINIDAE THE HORNS OF THE MALES ARE EXTRAORDINARILY VARIABLE IN THE SAME SPECIES JUST AS WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE LAMELLICORNS

IF THIS VIEW BE ADMITTED THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE EQUALLY SINGULAR COLOURS AND MARKS OF MANY OTHER ANTELOPES THOUGH COMMON TO BOTH SEXES HAVE BEEN GAINED AND TRANSMITTED IN A LIKE MANNER

BUT THE MEANING OF THIS AND OF MANY ANALOGOUS DIFFERENCES IS NOT AT ALL UNDERSTOOD

FINALLY FROM THE FACTS GIVEN IN THESE FOUR CHAPTERS WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT WEAPONS FOR BATTLE ORGANS FOR PRODUCING SOUND ORNAMENTS OF MANY KINDS BRIGHT AND CONSPICUOUS COLOURS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE MALES THROUGH VARIATION AND SEXUAL SELECTION AND HAVE BEEN TRANSMITTED IN VARIOUS WAYS ACCORDING TO THE SEVERAL LAWS OF INHERITANCE--THE FEMALES AND THE YOUNG BEING LEFT COMPARATIVELY BUT LITTLE MODIFIED
NOW IF BRILLIANT COLOURS HAD BEEN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO BIRDS WHILST SITTING ON THEIR OPEN NESTS THE MALES IN THESE CASES WOULD HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY

JUDGING FROM THE ANALOGY OF THE LOWER ANIMALS HE WOULD THEN EITHER LIVE WITH A SINGLE FEMALE OR BE A POLYGAMIST
WE THUS SEE THAT IN THE DIFFERENT COLEOPTEROUS FAMILIES THE STRIDULATING ORGANS ARE WONDERFULLY DIVERSIFIED IN POSITION BUT NOT MUCH IN STRUCTURE
THE FORMER ARE EITHER ABSOLUTELY USELESS SUCH AS THE MAMMAE OF MALE QUADRUPEDS OR THE INCISOR TEETH OF RUMINANTS WHICH NEVER CUT THROUGH THE GUMS
NEVERTHELESS IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SOME SKULLS OF VERY HIGH ANTIQUITY SUCH AS THE FAMOUS ONE OF NEANDERTHAL ARE WELL DEVELOPED AND CAPACIOUS
IT WAS ESTABLISHED FROM AN ENORMOUS BODY OF STATISTICS TAKEN DURING 1853 THAT THE UNMARRIED MEN THROUGHOUT FRANCE BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY AND EIGHTY DIE IN A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION THAN THE MARRIED
COMTE HAS REMARKS TO THIS EFFECT IN HIS TRAITE DE LEGISLATION 3RD ED
AND IT DEPENDS MERELY ON THE FORM OF INHERITANCE WHETHER THIS OR ANY OTHER TINT IS TRANSMITTED TO BOTH SEXES OR TO ONE ALONE
244 WHATEVER MAKES ANY BAD ACTION FAMILIAR TO THE MIND RENDERS ITS PERFORMANCE BY SO MUCH THE EASIER
AND IN CERTAIN GENERA THE YOUNG DIFFER FULLY AS MUCH IN APPEARANCE FROM THE ADULTS AS DO OUR CHILDREN FROM THEIR FULL-GROWN PARENTS
I AM INFORMED BY FRITZ MUELLER THAT IN THE FEMALE OF A BRAZILIAN SPECIES OF GELASIMUS THE WHOLE BODY IS OF A NEARLY UNIFORM GREYISH-BROWN
THEY THEN HAD THE HABIT OF ASSEMBLING VERY EARLY IN THE SPRING AT PARTICULAR SPOTS WHERE THEY COULD BE SEEN IN FLOCKS CHATTERING SOMETIMES FIGHTING BUSTLING AND FLYING ABOUT THE TREES

BEFORE DESCRIBING IN THE NEXT CHAPTER THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEXES IN VOICE ODOURS EMITTED AND ORNAMENTS IT WILL BE CONVENIENT HERE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE SEXES EXERT ANY CHOICE IN THEIR UNIONS
BUT THIS LATTER CONCLUSION IS DOUBTED BY MR MORGAN AND SIR J
IT IS ALSO WELL TO REFLECT ON SUCH FACTS AS THE WONDERFUL GROWTH OF GALLS ON PLANTS CAUSED BY THE POISON OF AN INSECT AND ON THE REMARKABLE CHANGES OF COLOUR IN THE PLUMAGE OF PARROTS WHEN FED ON CERTAIN FISHES OR INOCULATED WITH THE POISON OF TOADS 95

AND THIS PROBABLY ILLUSTRATES THE MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER AND HIGHER GROUPS WERE ONCE BLENDED TOGETHER

BOTH SEXES THEREFORE OF SUCH EARLY PAIRS WOULD AS ABOVE EXPLAINED HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER OTHERS IN REARING OFFSPRING
ON SOUNDS PRODUCED BY EUCHIRUS LONGIMANUS
WITH THE GRALLATORES EXTREMELY FEW SPECIES DIFFER SEXUALLY BUT THE RUFF MACHETES PUGNAX AFFORDS A MARKED EXCEPTION AND THIS SPECIES IS BELIEVED BY MONTAGU TO BE A POLYGAMIST

WITH RESPECT TO THE ABOVE GROUPS IN WHICH THE FEMALES ARE CONSPICUOUSLY COLOURED AND BUILD CONCEALED NESTS IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE THAT EACH SEPARATE SPECIES HAD ITS NIDIFYING INSTINCT SPECIALLY MODIFIED

WHEN BOTH SEXES ARE THUS PROVIDED THE INDIVIDUALS WHICH WERE ABLE TO MAKE THE LOUDEST OR MOST CONTINUOUS NOISE WOULD GAIN PARTNERS BEFORE THOSE WHICH WERE LESS NOISY SO THAT THEIR ORGANS HAVE PROBABLY BEEN GAINED THROUGH SEXUAL SELECTION
WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER FORM OF SEXUAL SELECTION WHICH WITH THE LOWER ANIMALS IS MUCH THE MORE COMMON NAMELY WHEN THE FEMALES ARE THE SELECTORS AND ACCEPT ONLY THOSE MALES WHICH EXCITE OR CHARM THEM MOST WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT FORMERLY ACTED ON OUR PROGENITORS

I HAVE BEEN STRUCK WITH THE LIKENESS OF MANY OF THE HALF-FAVOURABLE CRITICISMS ON SEXUAL SELECTION WITH THOSE WHICH APPEARED AT FIRST ON NATURAL SELECTION

GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IS OFTEN BROUGHT INTO PLAY UNCONSCIOUSLY AND SOMETIMES CONSCIOUSLY
SO THAT IN THIS LATTER RACE THE DIFFERENCE IN HEIGHT BETWEEN THE SEXES IS MORE THAN THRICE AS GREAT AS WITH THE AUSTRALIANS
FOR UNLESS THE FEMALES WERE ABLE TO APPRECIATE SUCH SOUNDS AND WERE EXCITED OR CHARMED BY THEM THE PERSEVERING EFFORTS OF THE MALES AND THE COMPLEX STRUCTURES OFTEN POSSESSED BY THEM ALONE WOULD BE USELESS
SO THAT IN ALL THESE RESPECTS THIS SPECIES COMES UNDER OUR FIRST CLASS OF CASES
NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THE FOLLOWING CHAPTER WILL BE DEVOTED TO THIS SUBJECT
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE MAY PARTLY ACCOUNT FOR THE FREQUENT AND EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF VARIABILITY PRESENTED BY SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS
AS VARIATIONS WHICH GIVE TO THE MALE A BETTER CHANCE OF CONQUERING OTHER MALES OR OF FINDING SECURING OR CHARMING THE OPPOSITE SEX WOULD IF THEY HAPPENED TO ARISE IN THE FEMALE BE OF NO SERVICE TO HER THEY WOULD NOT BE PRESERVED IN HER THROUGH SEXUAL SELECTION

FOR NOT TO MENTION THE VARIOUS DISPOSITIONS AND HABITS TRANSMITTED BY MANY OF OUR DOMESTIC ANIMALS TO THEIR OFFSPRING I HAVE HEARD OF AUTHENTIC CASES IN WHICH A DESIRE TO STEAL AND A TENDENCY TO LIE APPEARED TO RUN IN FAMILIES OF THE UPPER RANKS
CONSEQUENTLY THE WHOLE BODY OF MALES INHABITING THE SAME COUNTRY WOULD TEND FROM THE EFFECTS OF CONSTANT INTERCROSSING TO BECOME MODIFIED ALMOST UNIFORMLY BUT SOMETIMES A LITTLE MORE IN ONE CHARACTER AND SOMETIMES IN ANOTHER THOUGH AT AN EXTREMELY SLOW RATE
THEREFORE IF OTHER SPECIES OF GALLUS AND COLUMBA WERE DOMESTICATED AND VARIED IT WOULD NOT BE RASH TO PREDICT THAT SIMILAR RULES OF SEXUAL SIMILARITY AND DISSIMILARITY DEPENDING ON THE FORM OF TRANSMISSION WOULD HOLD GOOD IN BOTH CASES

IT IS HARDLY WORTH WHILE SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THE PROPORTION OF THE SEXES IN CERTAIN SPECIES AND EVEN GROUPS OF INSECTS FOR THE MALES ARE UNKNOWN OR VERY RARE AND THE FEMALES ARE PARTHENOGENETIC THAT IS FERTILE WITHOUT SEXUAL UNION
BESIDES THE MORE ACTIVE HABITS OF THE MALES THEIR EARLIER EMERGENCE FROM THE COCOON AND IN SOME CASES THEIR FREQUENTING MORE OPEN STATIONS OTHER CAUSES MAY BE ASSIGNED FOR AN APPARENT OR REAL DIFFERENCE IN THE PROPORTIONAL NUMBERS OF THE SEXES OF LEPIDOPTERA WHEN CAPTURED IN THE IMAGO STATE AND WHEN REARED FROM THE EGG OR CATERPILLAR STATE

IN MOST OF THE SPECIES OF THE SPLENDID FAMILY OF THE PHEASANTS THE MALES DIFFER CONSPICUOUSLY FROM THE FEMALES AND THEY ACQUIRE THEIR ORNAMENTS AT A RATHER LATE PERIOD OF LIFE

THIS FACT AS WELL AS THE POSSESSION OF HORNS BY BOTH SEXES SEEMS AT FIRST TO PROVE THAT THE HORNS IN THIS SPECIES DO NOT CONSTITUTE A SEXUAL CHARACTER 17

HE MIGHT THEN DECLARE--NOT THAT ANY BARBARIAN OR UNCULTIVATED MAN COULD THUS THINK--I AM THE SUPREME JUDGE OF MY OWN CONDUCT AND IN THE WORDS OF KANT I WILL NOT IN MY OWN PERSON VIOLATE THE DIGNITY OF HUMANITY
BUT IT SEEMS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE ABSENCE OF BRIGHTLY COLOURED SPECIES CAN BE EXPLAINED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF PROTECTION FOR ON THE PAMPAS WHICH ARE EQUALLY OPEN THOUGH COVERED BY GREEN GRASS AND WHERE THE BIRDS WOULD BE EQUALLY EXPOSED TO DANGER MANY BRILLIANT AND CONSPICUOUSLY COLOURED SPECIES ARE COMMON

FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THE COMPARATIVE INSIGNIFICANCE FOR CLASSIFICATION OF THE GREAT DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN IN MAN AND THAT THE STRONGLY-MARKED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SKULLS OF MAN AND THE QUADRUMANA LATELY INSISTED UPON BY BISCHOFF AEBY AND OTHERS APPARENTLY FOLLOW FROM THEIR DIFFERENTLY DEVELOPED BRAINS

THUS WHEN A DEVIL-CRAB PORTUNUS PUBER WAS SEEN BY A SON OF MR BATE FIGHTING WITH A CARCINUS MAENAS THE LATTER WAS SOON THROWN ON ITS BACK AND HAD EVERY LIMB TORN FROM ITS BODY

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE ORGANS IS INTELLIGIBLE THROUGH SEXUAL SELECTION IF THE MOST ODORIFEROUS MALES ARE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN WINNING THE FEMALES AND IN LEAVING OFFSPRING TO INHERIT THEIR GRADUALLY PERFECTED GLANDS AND ODOURS
AND THIS DOUBLE FORM OF SELECTION SEEMS ACTUALLY TO HAVE OCCURRED ESPECIALLY DURING THE EARLIER PERIODS OF OUR LONG HISTORY

IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED THAT IN SOME INSTANCES THE TRANSFERENCE OF CHARACTERS FROM THE MALE TO THE FEMALE HAS BEEN EFFECTED APPARENTLY AT A REMOTE PERIOD THE MALE HAVING SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERGONE GREAT CHANGES WITHOUT TRANSFERRING TO THE FEMALE ANY OF HIS LATER-GAINED CHARACTERS
IT MAY BE ADDED THAT IN 1844 AT WHICH PERIOD FEMALE INFANTICIDE HAD ONLY LATELY CEASED THE NON-ADULT MALES IN ONE DISTRICT WERE 281 AND THE NON ADULT FEMALES ONLY 194 THAT IS IN THE RATIO OF 144.8 MALES TO 100 FEMALES

OTHER ANIMALS BELONGING TO QUITE DISTINCT CLASSES ARE EITHER HABITUALLY OR OCCASIONALLY CAPABLE OF BREEDING BEFORE THEY HAVE FULLY ACQUIRED THEIR ADULT CHARACTERS

IN THE CASE OF THE LOWER ANIMALS IT SEEMS MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE TO SPEAK OF THEIR SOCIAL INSTINCTS AS HAVING BEEN DEVELOPED FOR THE GENERAL GOOD RATHER THAN FOR THE GENERAL HAPPINESS OF THE SPECIES
IN THE ONE IT IS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS OF THE SAME SEX GENERALLY THE MALES IN ORDER TO DRIVE AWAY OR KILL THEIR RIVALS THE FEMALES REMAINING PASSIVE

UNFORTUNATELY THIS CAN RARELY BE DONE

AND WHENEVER THE FEMALE LEFT IT SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY A TROOP SCREAMING HORRIBLE ACCLAMATIONS IN HER HONOUR IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO JUDGE WHETHER ANIMALS HAVE ANY FEELING FOR THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS OF THEIR KIND
IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY A MARVELLOUS FACT THAT SHE SHOULD POSSESS THIS ALMOST HUMAN DEGREE OF TASTE
FOR THESE ARE ALMOST CERTAINLY DUE TO CHARACTERS PRIMARILY ACQUIRED BY THE MALE HAVING BEEN MORE OR LESS TRANSFERRED TO THE FEMALE

BUT THE FACT IS THAT FOR EVERY 100 STILL-BORN FEMALES WE HAVE IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES FROM 134.6 TO 144.9 STILL-BORN MALES

IN SOME OTHER CASES THE LOWER SURFACES OF THE WINGS ARE BRILLIANTLY COLOURED AND YET ARE PROTECTIVE

IN 1835 ONLY ONE HUNDRED WERE LEFT
THE MALES AND THE YOUNG BEING LEFT NOT AT ALL OR BUT LITTLE MODIFIED
THE APPEARANCE OF THE LATTER
BESIDES THE SEVERAL CAUSES PREVIOUSLY ALLUDED TO THE GREATER FACILITY OF PARTURITION AMONGST SAVAGES AND THE LESS CONSEQUENT INJURY TO THEIR MALE INFANTS WOULD TEND TO INCREASE THE PROPORTION OF LIVE-BORN MALES TO FEMALES

ALL SUCH FACTS ARE HIGHLY INTERESTING AS BEARING ON ONE MEANS BY WHICH SPECIES MAY UNDERGO GREAT MODIFICATIONS OF CHARACTER IF ON THE OTHER HAND THE YOUNG NEVER SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING A FEMALE THE HABIT OF EARLY REPRODUCTION WOULD PERHAPS BE SOONER OR LATER ELIMINATED FROM BEING SUPERFLUOUS AND ENTAILING WASTE OF POWER

BUT THESE ARE OFTEN PAMPERED BY HIGH FEEDING AND SOMETIMES HAVE THEIR INSTINCTS VITIATED TO AN EXTREME DEGREE

THE SAME PRINCIPLE SEEMS TO COME INTO PLAY WITH VISION AS THE EYE PREFERS SYMMETRY OR FIGURES WITH SOME REGULAR RECURRENCE
ALL THESE FACTS WITH RESPECT TO MUSIC AND IMPASSIONED SPEECH BECOME INTELLIGIBLE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IF WE MAY ASSUME THAT MUSICAL TONES AND RHYTHM WERE USED BY OUR HALF-HUMAN ANCESTORS DURING THE SEASON OF COURTSHIP WHEN ANIMALS OF ALL KINDS ARE EXCITED NOT ONLY BY LOVE BUT BY THE STRONG PASSIONS OF JEALOUSY RIVALRY AND TRIUMPH
WE WILL FIRST CONSIDER THE ARGUMENTS WHICH MAY BE ADVANCED IN FAVOUR OF CLASSING THE RACES OF MAN AS DISTINCT SPECIES AND THEN THE ARGUMENTS ON THE OTHER SIDE
IN AN AUSTRALIAN TREE CREEPER CLIMACTERIS ERYTHROPS THE FEMALE DIFFERS FROM THE MALE IN BEING ADORNED WITH BEAUTIFUL RADIATED RUFOUS MARKINGS ON THE THROAT THE MALE HAVING THIS PART QUITE PLAIN LASTLY IN AN AUSTRALIAN NIGHT-JAR THE FEMALE ALWAYS EXCEEDS THE MALE IN SIZE AND IN THE BRILLIANCE OF HER TINTS
SIMILAR LONG HAIRS PROJECT FROM THE HAIRY COVERING OF THE SUPERCILIARY RIDGES IN SOME BABOONS
I SHOULD ADD THAT ON THE SECONDARY WING-FEATHER FARTHEST FROM THE BODY ALL THE OCELLI ARE SMALLER AND LESS PERFECT THAN ON THE OTHER FEATHERS AND HAVE THE UPPER PART OF THE RING DEFICIENT AS IN THE CASE JUST MENTIONED
I HEAR FROM PROFESSOR CANESTRINI THAT IT IS BELIEVED BY MANY BREEDERS IN ITALY THAT THE FEMALE CATERPILLAR OF THE SILK-MOTH SUFFERS MORE FROM THE RECENT DISEASE THAN THE MALE

WE MAY INFER FROM WHAT WE SEE OF THE VARIATION OF ANIMALS UNDER DOMESTICATION THAT THE ABOVE SEVERAL ORNAMENTS OF THE MANDRILL WERE GRADUALLY ACQUIRED BY ONE INDIVIDUAL VARYING A LITTLE IN ONE WAY AND ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL IN ANOTHER WAY

AND IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT WITH FISHES THE SEXES DIFFER IN THESE RESPECTS
THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURES FIGS
FOXES WARINESS OF YOUNG IN HUNTING DISTRICTS
FOR SUCH NATIONS DO NOT SUPPLANT AND EXTERMINATE ONE ANOTHER AS DO SAVAGE TRIBES
WITH THOSE ANTELOPES IN WHICH THE ADULT MALE IS MORE STRONGLY-COLOURED THAN THE FEMALE AND WITH THOSE MONKEYS IN WHICH THE HAIR ON THE FACE IS ELEGANTLY ARRANGED AND COLOURED IN A DIVERSIFIED MANNER IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT THE CRESTS AND TUFTS OF HAIR WERE GAINED AS ORNAMENTS
THE FACT HOWEVER OF THIS PECULIARITY BEING MOST STRONGLY DEVELOPED AT THAT INFANTILE PERIOD OF LIFE WHEN THE DRESS FOOD AND GENERAL TREATMENT OF BOTH SEXES ARE ALIKE SEEMS TO PROVE THAT THE HIGHER MALE DEATH-RATE IS AN IMPRESSED NATURAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL PECULIARITY DUE TO SEX ALONE DR STOCKTON HOUGH ACCOUNTS FOR THESE FACTS IN PART BY THE MORE FREQUENT DEFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF MALES THAN OF FEMALES
SOME NATURALISTS HAVE LATELY EMPLOYED THE TERM SUB-SPECIES TO DESIGNATE FORMS WHICH POSSESS MANY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF TRUE SPECIES BUT WHICH HARDLY DESERVE SO HIGH A RANK
EUCHORE HAS RATHER SHORT UPRIGHT HORNS WITH THE SHARP POINTS BENT INWARDS ALMOST AT RIGHT ANGLES SO AS TO FACE EACH OTHER
BUT THE RELATION BETWEEN THE CONTINUED USE OF LANGUAGE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN HAS NO DOUBT BEEN FAR MORE IMPORTANT
AFTER THIS HAD ONCE HAPPENED THEY ALWAYS FIRST HELD THE PACKET TO THEIR EARS TO DETECT ANY MOVEMENT WITHIN
I CANNOT THEREFORE UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT MR WALLACE 67
79 GIVES SOME STRIKING INSTANCES OF THIS LAW
ON THE ANAL APPENDAGES OF MALE INSECTS
WHITENESS A SEXUAL ORNAMENT IN SOME BIRDS
AND IN SOME FEW CASES FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE BODY
OF A SOUND STOCK WITHOUT DEFECT OR VICE
THE JAWS TOGETHER WITH THEIR MUSCLES WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN REDUCED THROUGH DISUSE AS WOULD THE TEETH THROUGH THE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD PRINCIPLES OF CORRELATION AND ECONOMY OF GROWTH
IF IT BE AN ADVANTAGE TO MAN TO STAND FIRMLY ON HIS FEET AND TO HAVE HIS HANDS AND ARMS FREE OF WHICH FROM HIS PRE-EMINENT SUCCESS IN THE BATTLE OF LIFE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THEN I CAN SEE NO REASON WHY IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE PROGENITORS OF MAN TO HAVE BECOME MORE AND MORE ERECT OR BIPEDAL
