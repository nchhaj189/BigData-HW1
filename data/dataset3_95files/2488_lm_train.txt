AS FOR NED LAND HE ENDED OUR TALK IN HIS BEST SPEECHIFYING STYLE
NEW OBSERVATIONS TAKEN BY THE TRANSATLANTIC LINER PEREIRE THE INMAN LINE'S ETNA RUNNING AFOUL OF THE MONSTER AN OFFICIAL REPORT DRAWN UP BY OFFICERS ON THE FRENCH FRIGATE NORMANDY DEAD-EARNEST RECKONINGS OBTAINED BY THE GENERAL STAFF OF COMMODORE FITZ-JAMES ABOARD THE LORD CLYDE
BUT AFTER TRANSMITTING ABOUT 400 TELEGRAMS IT WENT DEAD
YOU KNOW GERMAN I EXCLAIMED
TEN DAYS WENT BY IN THIS WAY
BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT THE CONVOY'S WEALTH WAS ABOUT TO FALL INTO ENEMY HANDS HE BURNED AND SCUTTLED THE GALLEONS WHICH WENT TO THE BOTTOM WITH THEIR IMMENSE TREASURES CAPTAIN NEMO STOPPED
THE SEA'S UNDULATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN CREATING A GENTLE ROCKING MOTION NOW CEASED
THE MOST REMARKABLE SOUNDINGS WERE TAKEN IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC NEAR THE 35TH PARALLEL AND THEY GAVE 12,000 METERS 14,091 METERS AND 15,149 METERS
AM I INDISCREET IN ASKING YOU ALL THESE THINGS NOT AT ALL PROFESSOR THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED ME AFTER A SLIGHT HESITATION SINCE YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE THIS UNDERWATER BOAT
AND ALREADY I COULD SEE ENORMOUS SHARKS MOVING IN EYES ABLAZE DRAWN BY THE LURE OF HUMAN FLESH
I WON'T ARGUE WITH YOU NED LAND ANSWERED
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT MANY WHO FACE THOSE FEARSOME ANIMALS DON'T COME BACK ALIVE
ITS LENGTH IS 275 MILES
THE SECOND SUBGENUS GAVE US SOME DIDACTYLUS SPECIMENS THREE TO FOUR DECIMETERS LONG STREAKED WITH YELLOW THEIR HEADS HAVING A PHANTASMAGORIC APPEARANCE
ARE YOU A PHYSICIAN HE REPEATED
THE CAPTAIN PLACED BEFORE MY EYES A WORKING DRAWING THAT GAVE THE GROUND PLAN CROSS SECTION AND SIDE VIEW OF THE NAUTILUS
SUDDENLY THERE WAS AN ERUPTION
TORTURED BY THE GROWLING OF HIS WELL-BUILT STOMACH NED LAND WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE RILED AND DESPITE HIS WORD OF HONOR I WAS IN REAL DREAD OF AN EXPLOSION WHEN HE STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF ONE OF THE MEN ON BOARD
THE SPARKLES FROM THESE MYRIADS OF DIAMONDS WERE MERGING WITH EACH OTHER
BUT DON'T I SEE AN OPENING AT ITS SUMMIT YES ITS CRATER A CRATER FORMERLY FILLED WITH LAVA STEAM AND FLAMES BUT WHICH NOW LETS IN THIS LIFE-GIVING AIR WE'RE BREATHING BUT WHICH VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN IS THIS I ASKED
ON THE CETACEAN QUESTION NO DOUBTS AROSE IN HIS MIND AND HE DIDN'T ALLOW THE ANIMAL'S EXISTENCE TO BE DISPUTED ABOARD HIS VESSEL
I ASK YOU
EITHER THE NAUTILUS SURFACED ONLY ENOUGH TO LET ITS PILOTHOUSE EMERGE OR IT SLIPPED AWAY TO THE LOWER DEPTHS ALTHOUGH BETWEEN THE GREEK ISLANDS AND ASIA MINOR WE DIDN'T FIND BOTTOM EVEN AT 2,000 METERS DOWN
DROPPING ANCHOR BEFORE VANIKORO A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE NEW ASTROLABE'S DEPARTURE THE BAYONNAISE DIDN'T FIND ANY ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE BUT VERIFIED THAT THE SAVAGES HADN'T DISTURBED THE MEMORIAL HONORING THE COUNT DE LA PéROUSE
THERE ALSO WERE WALLS ABOVE AND BELOW
BUT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I'LL NEVER GET INTO THOSE THINGS UNLESS THEY FORCE ME NO ONE WILL FORCE YOU MR LAND CAPTAIN NEMO SAID
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED HOW A LOVE OF FREEDOM AND HATRED OF SLAVERY COULD LEAD TO PLANS OF VENGEANCE IN A TEMPERAMENT LIKE THE CANADIAN'S WHAT HE MIGHT THINK ATTEMPT ENDEAVOR I FELL SILENT
THEY WERE HOWLING NOT IN ANGER BUT IN GLEE
TEN MINUTES LATER CAPTAIN NEMO STOPPED SUDDENLY
THE HOURS PASSED
THE SHIPPING MERCANTILE GAZETTE THE LLOYD'S LIST FRANCE'S PACKETBOAT AND MARITIME COLONIAL REVIEW ALL THE RAGS DEVOTED TO INSURANCE COMPANIES--WHO THREATENED TO RAISE THEIR PREMIUM RATES WERE UNANIMOUS ON THIS POINT
I DREAMED--ONE DOESN'T CHOOSE HIS DREAMS--THAT MY LIFE HAD BEEN REDUCED TO THE VEGETATING EXISTENCE OF A SIMPLE MOLLUSK
BUT ONCE THERE WHAT TRANQUILITY WE FOUND WHAT SILENCE WHAT PEACE ALL AROUND US
NOT A SOUND REACHED MY EAR
TWENTY MILES WIDE IT'S ONLY FIFTY-TWO KILOMETERS LONG AND WITH THE NAUTILUS LAUNCHED AT FULL SPEED CLEARING IT WAS THE WORK OF BARELY AN HOUR
MEANWHILE THE HOURS PASSED OUR HUNGER NAGGED UNMERCIFULLY AND THIS TIME THE STEWARD DID NOT APPEAR
BUT I THOUGHT IT BEST TO WAIT FOR AN ACTUAL SHOW OF HOSTILITY
HE DISCOVERED THAT THE FIFTH COMPARTMENT HAD BEEN INVADED BY THE SEA AND THE SPEED OF THIS INVASION PROVED THAT THE LEAK WAS CONSIDERABLE
GENUS BALISTES FAMILY SCLERODERMA ORDER PLECTOGNATHA CONSEIL MUTTERED
IN FACT THANKS TO THIS CELLULAR ARRANGEMENT IT HAS THE RESISTANCE OF A STONE BLOCK AS IF IT WERE COMPLETELY SOLID
HERE DRESSED IN DIVING SUITS PICK AND MATTOCK IN HAND MY MEN GO OUT AND DIG THIS CARBON FUEL FOR WHICH I DON'T NEED A SINGLE MINE ON LAND
THE VESSEL WAS TWO MILES OFF
I EVEN THOUGHT I GLIMPSED MT
EELS BUTTERFISH GREENFISH BASS JEWELFISH FLYING FISH
HE WAS NO LONGER MY EQUAL HE WAS THE MAN OF THE WATERS THE SPIRIT OF THE SEAS
YE GODS THE CANADIAN SHOT BACK I'M STARTING TO APPRECIATE THE CHARMS OF CANNIBALISM NED NED
HE OPENED IT AND I SAW A BUNDLE OF PAPERS YELLOWED BUT STILL LEGIBLE
SO TILL I'VE BAGGED AN ANIMAL WITH CUTLETS I WON'T BE HAPPY NOR I NED UNTIL I'VE CAUGHT A BIRD OF PARADISE THEN LET'S KEEP HUNTING CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHILE HEADING BACK TO THE SEA
FORTUNATELY ITS SPEED WAS NOT EXCESSIVE
BUT WE'LL ATTACK THE BEASTS WITH AXES AND HARPOONS SIR THE CANADIAN SAID IF YOU DON'T TURN DOWN MY HELP I ACCEPT IT MR LAND WE'LL GO WITH YOU I SAID
IN ITS INTERIOR I HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS AND MUFFLED VOICES
BUT THE CAPTAIN REMAINED CONTENT WITH THIS METHOD OF REFINING MY WORK AND HE RARELY DISCUSSED IT WITH ME
AT THE SAME TIME I FELT A SWAYING A ROLLING OF MODERATE MAGNITUDE BUT DEFINITELY NOTICEABLE
CONSEIL AND I NO LONGER LEFT EACH OTHER
BUT MY NARRATIVE HAD NO RESULT OTHER THAN NED'S VOICING DEEP REGRET THAT HE HADN'T STROLLED ACROSS THE VIGO BATTLEFIELD ON HIS OWN BEHALF
LYING WELL OUT THAT ENORMOUS MACHINE STILL SEEMED COMPLETELY DESERTED
AND FINALLY AIR TANKS 7.5 METERS LONG AND EXTENDING TO THE STEMPOST
LASTLY I COULDN'T HELP SEEING THE ACTUAL SHADOWS OF LARGE BIRDS PASSING OVER OUR HEADS SWIFTLY SKIMMING THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
I ATE AND THEN FELL ASLEEP
THIS WHOLE FEARSOME SEQUENCE OF EVENTS APPEARED IN MY MIND'S EYE
BUT IF THEY DID APPROACH US AT LEAST THEY KEPT AT A DISTANCE REGRETTABLE FROM THE HUNTER'S STANDPOINT
A PALE AZURE CLEAR OF MISTS
THEIR LUMINOUS TRAIL GUIDED US TO THE NAUTILUS
BY THE ARCTIC AND THE LYONNAIS SUNK IN COLLISIONS
UNABLE TO I STOPPED HIM
IN A GROOVE WHERE THE BUTT WAS HEAVIEST A CARTRIDGE CLIP HELD SOME TWENTY ELECTRIC BULLETS THAT BY MEANS OF A SPRING AUTOMATICALLY TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE BARREL OF THE RIFLE
GIVEN SUCH A COMPLETE COLLECTION FROM THE SEAS OF JAPAN AND CHINA I WON'T MENTION EVERY VARIETY THAT PASSED BEFORE OUR DAZZLED EYES
THE SAND WAS HEAPED WITH THEM
NO FISHERMEN
SUCH SUFFERINGS ARE INDESCRIBABLE
THE FORMER TINTED WITH A BRIGHT LIMESTONE SHEEN WOULD HAVE SUPPLIED ENOUGH BUILDING MATERIAL TO MAKE A WHOLE MARBLE TOWN
NOT A CREWMAN WAS MISSING FROM HIS POST
THEN TURNING AROUND I BUMPED INTO A WOODEN TABLE NEXT TO WHICH SEVERAL STOOLS HAD BEEN SET
BUT WITH VERNE THE OPERATIVE WORD IS TRAVEL AND SOME OF HIS BEST-KNOWN TITLES DON'T REALLY QUALIFY AS SCI-FI
LEANING AGAINST THE SIDES OF THE SKIFF WE WERE CHATTING OF ONE THING AND ANOTHER WHEN NED LAND STRETCHED HIS HAND TOWARD A POINT IN THE WATER SAYING TO ME
FLAMES NEED OXYGEN FROM THE AIR AND ARE UNABLE TO SPREAD UNDERWATER
JUST THEN AS MUTE AND EMOTIONLESS AS EVER SEVEN CREWMEN CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
IN A CHURCH THE CANADIAN EXCLAIMED
CHAPTER 10 THE UNDERWATER COALFIELDS THE NEXT DAY FEBRUARY 20 I OVERSLEPT
MEANWHILE NED LAND KEPT STARING
SOMETIMES THIS NOISE INCREASED AND BECAME A CONTINUOUS CRACKLE
I WAS SORRY TO MISS THIS REPTILE BECAUSE FROM CONSEIL'S DESCRIPTION I BELIEVE I RECOGNIZED THE LEATHERBACK TURTLE A PRETTY RARE SPECIES
SCIENTISTS MAYBE PARDON ME NED
THAT'S ATROCIOUS ON THAT NOTE PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME YOU AND YOUR COMPANIONS WILL VISIT THE MANNAR OYSTERBANK AND IF BY CHANCE SOME EAGER FISHERMAN ARRIVES EARLY WELL WE CAN WATCH HIM AT WORK THAT SUITS ME CAPTAIN BY THE WAY PROFESSOR ARONNAX YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF SHARKS ARE YOU SHARKS I EXCLAIMED
THE DELICATELY FESTOONED RIM OF THIS SHELL SUPPLIED BY THE BIGGEST MOLLUSK IN THE CLASS ACEPHALA MEASURED ABOUT SIX METERS IN CIRCUMFERENCE
THANKS TO ITS HEATING EQUIPMENT THE NAUTILUS'S TEMPERATURE NEEDLESS TO SAY STAYED AT A MUCH HIGHER DEGREE
THEN IT GATHERED ITSELF AND SPRANG AT US
AS FOR ME WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'LL GO PERCH ON THE BOBSTAYS UNDER THE BOWSPRIT AND IF WE CAN GET WITHIN A HARPOON LENGTH I'LL HARPOON THE BRUTE GO TO IT NED COMMANDER FARRAGUT REPLIED
THERE THE CAPTAIN FIXED HIS POSITION AND USED A CHRONOMETER TO CALCULATE HIS LONGITUDE WHICH HE DOUBLE-CHECKED AGAINST HIS PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS OF HOUR ANGLES
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS CAME BACK ON
THE QUESTION TOOK AN ENTIRELY NEW TURN
IT WAS A DREADFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS
I WANTED TO REPLY TO THE CANADIAN BUT WORDS FAILED ME
VIBRATING RESONANTLY IT KNIFED THROUGH THE WATERY MASS
A MILD BREEZE OUT OF THE EAST RIPPLED THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
PROFESSOR ARONNAX WE'RE IN LONGITUDE 137 DEGREES 15 WEST WEST OF WHICH MERIDIAN I ASKED QUICKLY HOPING THE CAPTAIN'S REPLY MIGHT GIVE ME A CLUE TO HIS NATIONALITY
CONSEIL AND I FOLLOWED SUIT
BESIDES BEFORE WE COULD DO ANYTHING WE HAD TO BE FREE AND THAT WE DEFINITELY WERE NOT
THIS MYSTERY PUZZLED ME
IN SHORT A THOUSAND QUESTIONS I HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER
PERHAPS
PERHAPS
PERHAPS
PERHAPS
IT'S AN ACTUAL CHAIN THAT FETTERS HIM TO THE SHORE AND IF WE WERE TO BE BOUND IN THIS WAY TO THE NAUTILUS WE COULDN'T GO FAR EITHER THEN HOW DO YOU BREAK FREE I ASKED
THIS REACTION MOUNTED UPWARD FROM THE BOWELS OF THE SHIP FROM THE QUARTERS OF THE BUNKER HANDS TO THE MESSROOM OF THE GENERAL STAFF
HE BEGAN BY REMOVING FROM EACH TRUNK AN INCH-THICK STRIP OF BARK THAT COVERED A NETWORK OF LONG HOPELESSLY TANGLED FIBERS THAT WERE PUTTIED WITH A SORT OF GUMMY FLOUR
HOW MANY DELIGHTFUL HOURS I SPENT IN THIS WAY AT THE LOUNGE WINDOW
YOU COULDN'T EVEN FIND ITS HIDING PLACE BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF MIST
PAST THE BOUNDARIES OF THE CLEARING THE DARKNESS DEEPENED AGAIN RELIEVED ONLY BY LITTLE SPARKLES GIVEN OFF BY THE SHARP CRESTS OF CORAL
BOTH CONTUSION AND CONCUSSION OF THE BRAIN HAD OCCURRED
YOU I SAID
IF I RECOMMEND THAT HE AIM CAREFULLY AT THIS DUGONG IT'S BECAUSE THE ANIMAL IS JUSTLY REGARDED AS FINE GAME AND I KNOW MR LAND DOESN'T DESPISE A CHOICE MORSEL AHA THE CANADIAN PUT IN
IN ESSENCE IF I REPRESENT THE DENSITY OF FRESH WATER BY 1.000 THEN I FIND 1.028 FOR THE WATERS OF THE ATLANTIC 1.026 FOR THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC 1.030 FOR THE WATERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AHA I THOUGHT SO HE VENTURES INTO THE MEDITERRANEAN
DOLPHINFISH WITH AZURE FINS GOLD TAILS AND FLESH THAT'S UNRIVALED IN THE ENTIRE WORLD WRASSE FROM THE GENUS HOLOGYMNOSUS THAT WERE NEARLY DENUDED OF SCALES BUT EXQUISITE IN FLAVOR KNIFEJAWS WITH BONY BEAKS YELLOWISH ALBACORE THAT WERE AS TASTY AS BONITO ALL FISH WORTH CLASSIFYING IN THE SHIP'S PANTRY
THIS HULL THE ENGINE THE BALLAST THE VARIOUS ACCESSORIES AND ACCOMMODATIONS PLUS THE BULKHEADS AND INTERIOR BRACES HAVE A COMBINED WEIGHT OF 961.52 METRIC TONS WHICH WHEN ADDED TO 394.96 METRIC TONS GIVES US THE DESIRED TOTAL OF 1,356.48 METRIC TONS
THEY'RE HEALTHY AND NOURISHING
WON'T THEY COME INSIDE THE NAUTILUS HOW WILL THEY MANAGE THAT BY JUMPING DOWN THE HATCHES YOU'RE ABOUT TO OPEN PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED SERENELY THE NAUTILUS'S HATCHES AREN'T TO BE ENTERED IN THAT FASHION EVEN WHEN THEY'RE OPEN I GAPED AT THE CAPTAIN
IN ANY CASE THERE WAS NO TIME FOR EXPLANATIONS
SCATTERED ON HIGH THE CLOUDS WERE COLORED IN BRIGHT WONDERFULLY SHADED HUES AND NUMEROUS LADYFINGERS WARNED OF DAYLONG WINDS AUTHOR'S NOTE
THE NAUTILUS'S NETS HAULED UP SEVERAL TYPES OF SEA TURTLE FROM THE HAWKSBILL GENUS WITH ARCHING BACKS WHOSE SCALES ARE HIGHLY PRIZED
IT RETURNED TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES SO OUR DAILY STROLLS ON THE PLATFORM WERE RESTORED TO US
LOOKING WITH GREATER CARE I OBSERVED THAT FOUR OF THEM WERE CARRYING ON THEIR SHOULDERS AN OBJECT THAT WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE
WHERE WAS IT GOING
IN FRONT OF US STOOD THE PILOTHOUSE AND UNLESS I'M EXTREMELY MISTAKEN CAPTAIN NEMO MUST HAVE BEEN INSIDE STEERING HIS NAUTILUS HIMSELF
WE HAVE NO USE FOR WHALE OIL ON THIS SHIP BUT SIR THE CANADIAN WENT ON IN THE RED SEA YOU AUTHORIZED US TO CHASE A DUGONG THERE IT WAS AN ISSUE OF OBTAINING FRESH MEAT FOR MY CREW
THE CREW CALLED THEMSELVES OUT-AND-OUT FOOLS FOR BEING HOODWINKED BY A FAIRY TALE THEN GREW STEADILY MORE FURIOUS
IT WENT UP TO ABOUT LATITUDE 42 DEGREES
ANGER WON'T GET US ANYWHERE BUT PROFESSOR OUR IRASCIBLE COMPANION WENT ON CAN'T YOU SEE THAT WE COULD DIE OF HUNGER IN THIS IRON CAGE BAH CONSEIL PUT IN PHILOSOPHICALLY
WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT A DREADFUL HURRICANE WAS THEN UNLEASHED ON THE SURFACE OF THIS OCEAN
TOGETHER THESE TWO BARRICADES CONFINE THE WHOLE SUBMERGED CONTINENT OF ATLANTIS
WHICH MEANS THE CANADIAN WENT ON SINCE I'VE NEVER FISHED THESE WATERWAYS I DON'T KNOW THE WHALES THAT FREQUENT THEM THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU NED ALL THE MORE REASON TO GET TO KNOW THEM CONSEIL ANSWERED
A FEW MONTHS LATER OFF THE COAST OF SYRIA I RECAPTURED A FEW SPECIMENS OF MY FISH ADORNED WITH THEIR TELLTALE RINGS
THERE A NATIVE BOATMAN PULLED ALONGSIDE IN A DUGOUT CANOE AND SOLD DILLON A SILVER SWORD HILT BEARING THE IMPRINT OF CHARACTERS ENGRAVED WITH A CUTTING TOOL KNOWN AS A BURIN
I HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY DECIDING
IT WAS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
THESE WATERS WITNESS THE REPRODUCTION AND GROWTH OF SOFT DELICATE BATH SPONGES WHOSE PRICES RUN AS HIGH AS 150 FRANCS APIECE
IN ANY CASE THIS WALL SEEMED TO SIGNAL THE END OF ATLANTIS OF WHICH ALL IN ALL WE HAD CROSSED ONLY A SMALL PART
SETTING ITS COURSE TO THE NORTH-NORTHWEST THE SHIP HEADED TOWARD THE GULF OF OMAN CARVED OUT BETWEEN ARABIA AND THE INDIAN PENINSULA AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE PERSIAN GULF
ITS GIRTH WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO JUDGE BUT ALL IN ALL THE ANIMAL SEEMED TO BE WONDERFULLY PROPORTIONED IN ALL THREE DIMENSIONS
FROM THAT DAY FORWARD WHO KNOWS WHERE THE NAUTILUS TOOK US IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC BASIN
WHAT GOES ON IN THOSE DISTANT DEPTHS
WHAT GOES ON IN THOSE DISTANT DEPTHS
HAD SOME SAILOR ON BOARD LIVED TO TELL THE STORY OF THIS DREADFUL DISASTER OR DO THE WAVES STILL KEEP THIS CASUALTY A SECRET
A CIRCUMSTANCE LESS THAN ENCOURAGING
STRANGE RUMBLINGS WERE AUDIBLE ALONG OUR SIDES
INSIDE THE MEDITERRANEAN THEN I COULD CATCH NO MORE OF ITS FAST-PASSING SCENERY THAN A TRAVELER MIGHT SEE FROM AN EXPRESS TRAIN
IN 1861 TO THE NORTHEAST OF TENERIFE AND FAIRLY NEAR THE LATITUDE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW THE CREW OF THE GUNBOAT ALECTO SPOTTED A MONSTROUS SQUID SWIMMING IN THEIR WATERS
I UNDID THE LINEN BANDAGES WHILE THE WOUNDED MAN GAZED WITH GREAT STARING EYES AND LET ME PROCEED WITHOUT MAKING A SINGLE COMPLAINT
THE MIXTURE IN OUR STORMGLASS DECOMPOSED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE ELECTRICITY CHARGING THE AIR
GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND PEACE ON EARTH TO MEN OF GOOD WILL I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND THIS ELECTRIC CABLE IN MINT CONDITION AS IT LOOKED ON LEAVING ITS PLACE OF MANUFACTURE
I DREW CONSEIL'S ATTENTION TO THE CONSIDERABLE GROWTH OF THE CEREBRAL LOBES FOUND IN THESE INTELLIGENT CETACEANS
WE'RE CRUISING IN A CURRENT OF BOILING WATER IT CAN'T BE I EXCLAIMED
THEY ARE SAID TO FOLLOW SHIPS IN SEARCH OF REFRESHING SHADE FROM THE HOT TROPICAL SUN AND THEY DID JUST THAT WITH THE NAUTILUS AS THEY HAD ONCE DONE WITH THE VESSELS OF THE COUNT DE LA PéROUSE
THERE THROUGH THE OPEN PANELS AND IN A MIDWATER OF CRYSTAL CLARITY OUR SHIP ENABLED US TO STUDY WONDERFUL BUSHES OF SHINING CORAL AND HUGE CHUNKS OF ROCK WRAPPED IN SPLENDID GREEN FURS OF ALGAE AND FUCUS
OBVIOUSLY YOUR BATTERIES COULD DO THE EXTRACTING
I STARED AT ALL ITS WEALTH ALL ITS TREASURES LIKE A MAN ON THE EVE OF HIS ETERNAL EXILE A MAN DEPARTING TO RETURN NO MORE
THE SEA WAS SMOOTH THE SKIES CLEAR
SO ONLY 150 FEET SEPARATED US FROM THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
PROFESSOR PIERRE ARONNAX HE SAID TO ME
NAUTRON RESPOC LORNI VIRCH WHAT IT MEANT I WAS UNABLE TO SAY
HISSING SOUNDS SOON TOLD ME THAT WATER WAS BEING ADMITTED INTO THE BALLAST TANKS
IN ESSENCE OVER AN HOUR'S TIME A SINGLE HUMAN BEING CONSUMES ALL THE OXYGEN FOUND IN 100 LITERS OF AIR AT WHICH POINT THAT AIR HAS BECOME CHARGED WITH A NEARLY EQUAL AMOUNT OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND IS NO LONGER FIT FOR BREATHING
BESIDES I COUNTED ON THE FUTURE TO RESOLVE THIS IMPORTANT QUESTION
THIS WAS JUST ONE MORE OF THOSE INSOLUBLE PROBLEMS THAT KEPT WELLING UP IN MY MIND
500,000 11,000,000 MY FRIEND 11,000,000
BUT SINCE I DON'T WANT TO BE ACCUSED OF FOOLHARDINESS I'M GIVING YOU ALL MY OBJECTIONS IN ADVANCE YOU HAVE MORE JUST ONE
ONE FOR FRUIT ANOTHER FOR VEGETABLES AND A THIRD FOR VENISON OF WHICH I STILL HAVEN'T GLIMPSED THE TINIEST SPECIMEN DON'T GIVE UP SO EASILY CONSEIL THE CANADIAN REPLIED
CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE JUST WANDERING AROUND AT RANDOM
BUT MY COMPANIONS AND I WOULD BE WILLING TO SAFEGUARD THIS MANUSCRIPT AND IF YOU GIVE US BACK OUR FREEDOM YOUR FREEDOM CAPTAIN NEMO PUT IN STANDING UP
IN EITHER CASE OUR FORWARD MOTION WOULDN'T RECEIVE AN ABSOLUTE CHECK
IT WAS A MAN A LIVING MAN A BLACK INDIAN FISHERMAN A POOR DEVIL WHO NO DOUBT HAD COME TO GATHER WHAT HE COULD BEFORE HARVEST TIME
AT CERTAIN MOMENTS THE SHIP ENCOUNTERED ICE AT A DEPTH OF 900 METERS DENOTING A THICKNESS OF 1,200 METERS OF WHICH 300 METERS ROSE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE OCEAN
WITHIN MOMENTS THEY HAD LOCATED A HOLE TWO METERS IN WIDTH ON THE STEAMER'S UNDERSIDE
THEN HIS EXAMINATION OVER HE APPROACHED THE HATCH AND PRONOUNCED A PHRASE WHOSE EXACT WORDING FOLLOWS BELOW
DID YOU KNOW PROFESSOR HE ASKED ME WITH A SMILE THAT THE SEA CONTAINED SUCH WEALTH I KNOW IT'S ESTIMATED I REPLIED THAT THERE ARE 2,000,000 METRIC TONS OF SILVER HELD IN SUSPENSION IN SEAWATER SURELY BUT IN EXTRACTING THAT SILVER YOUR EXPENSES WOULD OUTWEIGH YOUR PROFITS
YES I SAID IT'S A WONDERFUL SIGHT
AND SILVER MOONFISH WORTHY OF THEIR NAME ROSE ON THE HORIZON OF THE WATERS LIKE THE WHITISH REFLECTIONS OF MANY MOONS
FIFTY FEET BELOW ITS PEAK AMID A SHOWER OF STONES AND SLAG A WIDE CRATER VOMITED TORRENTS OF LAVA THAT WERE DISPERSED IN FIERY CASCADES INTO THE HEART OF THE LIQUID MASS
AND I'LL BE ABLE TO VISIT THOSE FAMOUS ISLANDS WHERE THE COMPASS AND THE ASTROLABE CAME TO GRIEF IF YOU LIKE PROFESSOR WHEN WILL WE REACH VANIKORO WE ALREADY HAVE PROFESSOR FOLLOWED BY CAPTAIN NEMO I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM AND FROM THERE MY EYES EAGERLY SCANNED THE HORIZON
DURING PREHISTORIC TIMES AN ERA OF FIRE WAS FOLLOWED BY AN ERA OF WATER
BESIDES FRENCHMEN ENGLISHMEN AMERICANS DANES AND NORWEGIANS CATCH THESE COD BY THE THOUSANDS
THE SUN'S RAYS PIERCED THE CLOUD CURTAIN GATHERED ON THE EASTERLY HORIZON AND THE RADIANT ORB ROSE SWIFTLY
WHAT'S NED LAND UP TO BEGGING MASTER'S INDULGENCE CONSEIL REPLIED BUT OUR FRIEND NED IS CONCOCTING A KANGAROO PIE THAT WILL BE THE EIGHTH WONDER I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF
LAST EVENING IT WENT TO SLEEP JUST AS WE DID AND THERE IT IS WAKING UP AFTER A PEACEFUL NIGHT NO HELLOS OR GOOD MORNINGS FOR THIS GENT
I SHUDDERED AS IF SOME INVISIBLE EYE HAD PLUNGED INTO MY INNERMOST THOUGHTS AND I RUSHED OUTSIDE THE STATEROOM
BUT WHEN A LITTLE GLASS OF VINEGAR IS WORTH 1,500,000 FRANCS ITS TASTE IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MARRY THE GAL THE CANADIAN SAID THROWING UP HIS HANDS WITH AN AIR OF DISCOURAGEMENT
NO MUSEUM IN EUROPE OWNS SUCH A COLLECTION OF EXHIBITS FROM THE OCEAN
THE MINERAL AND ORGANIC SUBSTANCES IT HOLDS IN SUSPENSION ACTUALLY INCREASE ITS TRANSLUCENCY
WHEN I'VE MIXED THIS HONEY WITH OUR BREADFRUIT BATTER HE TOLD US I'LL BE READY TO SERVE YOU A DELECTABLE PIECE OF CAKE BUT OF COURSE CONSEIL PUT IN IT WILL BE GINGERBREAD I'M ALL FOR GINGERBREAD I SAID BUT LET'S RESUME THIS FASCINATING STROLL AT CERTAIN TURNS IN THE TRAIL WE WERE GOING ALONG THE LAKE APPEARED IN ITS FULL EXPANSE
IS THAT YOU PROFESSOR AH CAPTAIN NEMO I REPLIED
I COULDN'T HELP SMILING AT THIS OUTLANDISH NOTION
BUT BELIEVE YOU ME I HAD MY FILL AT THE SOUTH POLE AND I'M NOT GOING WITH HIM TO THE NORTH POLE WHAT CAN WE DO NED SINCE IT ISN'T FEASIBLE TO ESCAPE RIGHT NOW I KEEP COMING BACK TO MY IDEA
BUT ITS NUCLEUS IS ALWAYS SOME SMALL HARD OBJECT SAY A STERILE EGG OR A GRAIN OF SAND AROUND WHICH THE MOTHER-OF-PEARL IS DEPOSITED IN THIN CONCENTRIC LAYERS OVER SEVERAL YEARS IN SUCCESSION CAN ONE FIND SEVERAL PEARLS IN THE SAME OYSTER CONSEIL ASKED
WE HAD ARRIVED AT THE FOOT OF A STURDY CLUMP OF DRAGON TREES WHICH WERE SPLITTING THE ROCKS WITH EXERTIONS OF THEIR MUSCULAR ROOTS WHEN NED LAND EXCLAIMED
CONSEIL NOTICED AS MUCH
JUST THEN THE BEACON SUDDENLY WENT ON AND ITS INTENSE BRIGHTNESS MADE THAT HAZY LIGHT VANISH
THE MONSTER EXISTED AND HE HAD VOWED TO RID THE SEAS OF IT
THE SAME I REPLIED
A WHALE OF UNKNOWN SPECIES 30 8
I'LL SEE YOU THIS EVENING THE SEA IS ROUGH I SAID
FROM 67 DEGREES 30 TO 90 DEGREES TWENTY-TWO AND A HALF DEGREES OF LATITUDE WERE LEFT TO CROSS IN OTHER WORDS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 500 LEAGUES
FOLLOWING IT DOWN THE NAUTILUS KEPT WATCH ON ITS EVERY MOVEMENT
IF IT WAS GOING TO ENTER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL IT CLEARLY NEEDED TO HEAD EAST
MEANWHILE THE BALLAST TANKS FILLED WITH WATER AND THE NAUTILUS SANK SLOWLY
ONE IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC A SECOND IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC A THIRD IN THE NORTH PACIFIC A FOURTH IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND A FIFTH IN THE SOUTHERN INDIAN OCEAN
THE SHELL REACHED ITS TARGET
A MEAL IS WAITING FOR YOU IN YOUR CABIN HE TOLD THEM
IT WAS DURING THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER 9-10 THAT THE NAUTILUS ENCOUNTERED THIS ARMY OF DISTINCTLY NOCTURNAL MOLLUSKS
I WOULD ASK ONE QUESTION HOWEVER WHICH YOU NEEDN'T ANSWER IF IT'S INDISCREET
I COULD SINK UNDER THE SEA AND I COULD FORGET YOU EVER EXISTED
PORGIES TINTED ORANGE WITH SLENDER TONGUES
BY THEN THE DARKNESS WAS PROFOUND AND AS GOOD AS THE CANADIAN'S EYES WERE I STILL WONDERED HOW HE COULD SEE--AND WHAT HE HAD SEEN
THEY MAKE COUNTERFEIT BIRDS OF PARADISE YES CONSEIL AND IS MASTER FAMILIAR WITH HOW THE ISLANDERS GO ABOUT IT PERFECTLY FAMILIAR
AFTER I MONITORED THE OPERATION'S PROGRESS DOUBLE-CHECKING IT WITH MANY INSPECTIONS I TOLD THE CAPTAIN IT'S WORKING I THINK SO HE ANSWERED ME
WE WERE FULLY AFLOAT AS I HAVE SAID
FOR WHO WOULD DARE CHASE HIM TO THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA WHEN HE THWARTED ALL ATTACKS ON THE SURFACE
WHATEVER IT IS NED LAND WENT ON ANY ANIMAL HAVING FOUR FEET WITHOUT FEATHERS OR TWO FEET WITH FEATHERS WILL BE GREETED BY MY VERY OWN ONE-GUN SALUTE OH GOOD I REPLIED
TRADERS SHIPOWNERS CAPTAINS OF VESSELS SKIPPERS AND MASTER MARINERS FROM EUROPE AND AMERICA NAVAL OFFICERS FROM EVERY COUNTRY AND AT THEIR HEELS THE VARIOUS NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS ON THESE TWO CONTINENTS WERE ALL EXTREMELY DISTURBED BY THE BUSINESS
THE VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN CONE SNAIL FROM THE GENUS COENODULLUS
A GENUINE PRAIRIE A TIGHTLY WOVEN CARPET OF ALGAE GULFWEED AND BLADDER WRACK SO DENSE AND COMPACT A CRAFT'S STEMPOST COULDN'T TEAR THROUGH IT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
BUT IT OFFERED A WONDERFUL MIXTURE OF HUES
A PROFOUND SILENCE REIGNED OVER THE DECK
IT WAS THE CORAL REALM
WHO SAYS I DON'T PUT IT TO GOOD USE
THE MASTERS ARE AGELESS WHAT ABOUT THESE COMPOSERS I SAID POINTING TO SHEET MUSIC BY WEBER ROSSINI MOZART BEETHOVEN HAYDN MEYERBEER HéROLD WAGNER AUBER GOUNOD VICTOR MASSé AND A NUMBER OF OTHERS SCATTERED OVER A FULL SIZE PIANO-ORGAN WHICH OCCUPIED ONE OF THE WALL PANELS IN THIS LOUNGE
MELITA CORAL RAINBOW CORAL WITH JOINTED OUTGROWTHS THEN A FEW TUFTS OF GENUS CORALLINA SOME GREEN AND OTHERS RED ACTUALLY A TYPE OF SEAWEED ENCRUSTED WITH LIMESTONE SALTS WHICH AFTER LONG DISPUTES NATURALISTS HAVE FINALLY PLACED IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM
DURING THE NIGHT ALL THESE MEMORIES CROSSED OVER FROM ONE DREAM TO THE NEXT NOT GIVING MY BRAIN A MOMENT'S REST
ALTHOUGH THE HARPOON HAD BEEN FORCEFULLY HURLED IT APPARENTLY HAD HIT ONLY WATER
I OPENED MY DOOR HEADED DOWN THE GANGWAYS AND CLIMBED THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY
BUT THE SCIENTIST FOREVER INQUISITIVE DREADS IT
I MIGHT ADD THAT DURING THE NIGHT THE GULF STREAM'S PHOSPHORESCENT WATERS RIVALED THE ELECTRIC GLOW OF OUR BEACON ESPECIALLY IN THE STORMY WEATHER THAT FREQUENTLY THREATENED US
WE WERE ALONE
THEY SWAM BACKWARD WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED MOVING BY MEANS OF THEIR LOCOMOTIVE TUBES CHASING FISH AND MOLLUSKS EATING THE LITTLE ONES EATEN BY THE BIG ONES AND TOSSING IN INDESCRIBABLE CONFUSION THE TEN FEET THAT NATURE HAS ROOTED IN THEIR HEADS LIKE A HAIRPIECE OF PNEUMATIC SNAKES
MOBILIS IN MOBILI N MOVING WITHIN THE MOVING ELEMENT
CAPTAIN NEMO HAD BROUGHT A SPYGLASS WITH A RETICULAR EYEPIECE WHICH CORRECTED THE SUN'S REFRACTION BY MEANS OF A MIRROR AND HE USED IT TO OBSERVE THE ORB SINKING LITTLE BY LITTLE ALONG A VERY EXTENDED DIAGONAL THAT REACHED BELOW THE HORIZON
THERE LIES EVERYTHING I HATE
THE LAMPREY AN ACQUIRED TASTE NED LAND REPLIED
THANK HEAVENS I SAID TO MYSELF
I COUNTED SEVEN OF THEM
EVERY MANEUVER WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH EXTRAORDINARY PRECISION
IT WAS ON MAY 17 ABOUT 500 MILES FROM HEART'S CONTENT AND 2,800 METERS DOWN THAT I SPOTTED THIS CABLE LYING ON THE SEAFLOOR
LIKE A TORRENT THE SEA WAS RUSHING INTO OUR RETREAT AND SINCE WE DEFINITELY WERE NOT MOLLUSKS WE HAD TO CLEAR OUT
JUST AS ON THE DAY BEFORE CAPTAIN NEMO CAME TO TAKE THE ALTITUDE OF THE SUN
THEN THEY PAINT OVER THE SUTURE VARNISH THE BIRD AND SHIP THE FRUITS OF THEIR UNIQUE LABORS TO MUSEUMS AND COLLECTORS IN EUROPE GOOD ENOUGH NED LAND PUT IN
AS SOON AS I WAS DRESSED I WENT INTO THE LOUNGE
YE GODS I NEVER WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT CONSEIL SAID
HARMLESS AND UNAGGRESSIVE THESE FINE ANIMALS WERE SIX TO SEVEN METERS LONG AND MUST HAVE WEIGHED AT LEAST 4,000 KILOGRAMS EACH
AT 9:15 WHEN OUR BOAT RETURNED TO THE SURFACE I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
ONE MAY DEFY HUMAN LAWS BUT NO ONE CAN WITHSTAND THE LAWS OF NATURE CAPTAIN NEMO HAD PICKED AN ODD TIME TO PHILOSOPHIZE
THERE ARE SCIENTIFIC TREASURES HERE AND I'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM THIS ROOM ISN'T ONLY A LIBRARY CAPTAIN NEMO SAID IT'S ALSO A SMOKING ROOM A SMOKING ROOM I EXCLAIMED
YET THERE WAS ONE HITCH
THEN THEY TRIED TO HAUL THE MONSTER ON BOARD BUT ITS WEIGHT WAS SO CONSIDERABLE THAT WHEN THEY TUGGED ON THE ROPE THE ANIMAL PARTED COMPANY WITH ITS TAIL
THEY WENT BY WITHOUT NOTICING US GRAZING US WITH THEIR BROWNISH FINS
AND BENEATH THE SHADE OF THEIR GREEN CANOPIES AT THE FEET OF THEIR GIGANTIC TRUNKS THERE GREW ORCHIDS LEGUMINOUS PLANTS AND FERNS
AND BESIDES ARE THEY ANY WORSE THAN MEN ELSEWHERE THESE PEOPLE YOU CALL SAVAGES BUT CAPTAIN SPEAKING FOR MYSELF SIR I'VE ENCOUNTERED THEM EVERYWHERE WELL THEN I REPLIED IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WELCOME THEM ABOARD THE NAUTILUS YOU'D BETTER TAKE SOME PRECAUTIONS EASY PROFESSOR NO CAUSE FOR ALARM BUT THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE NATIVES WHAT'S YOUR COUNT AT LEAST A HUNDRED PROFESSOR ARONNAX REPLIED CAPTAIN NEMO WHOSE FINGERS TOOK THEIR PLACES AGAIN ON THE ORGAN KEYS IF EVERY ISLANDER IN PAPUA WERE TO GATHER ON THAT BEACH THE NAUTILUS WOULD STILL HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THEIR ATTACKS THE CAPTAIN'S FINGERS THEN RAN OVER THE INSTRUMENT'S KEYBOARD AND I NOTICED THAT HE TOUCHED ONLY ITS BLACK KEYS WHICH GAVE HIS MELODIES A BASICALLY SCOTTISH COLOR
MASTER MUST CLOSE HIS EYES
HERE IT WOULD BE KILLING FOR THE SAKE OF KILLING
A GENTLE SLOPE GRAVITATED TO AN UNEVEN BOTTOM WHOSE DEPTH WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN FATHOMS
NED LAND WAS ALREADY THERE
I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT TO CHARGE WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THIS OPENING BUT IT WENT UP TO THE NORTHWEST THROUGH A LARGE NUMBER OF LITTLE-KNOWN ISLANDS AND ISLETS AND STEERED TOWARD TOUND ISLAND AND THE BAD CHANNEL
CAPTAIN NEMO WAS ALREADY UP AND I HAD STARTED TO STRETCH MY LIMBS WHEN AN UNEXPECTED APPARITION BROUGHT ME SHARPLY TO MY FEET
HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE A FEW HOURS BEFORE US AND IN A FEW HOURS ONE CAN DO A GREAT MANY THINGS CONSEIL'S UNFLAPPABLE COMPOSURE CHEERED ME UP
THE LATTER AFTER CAREFULLY OBSERVING THE ANIMAL CALLED FOR HIS ENGINEER
GRAY MULLET THRASHED THE SEA WITH THEIR BIG FLESHY TAILS
AMONG THE FOODS WE WERE SERVED I WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY VARIOUS DAINTILY DRESSED FISH
I THEN ENTERED A DINING ROOM DECORATED AND FURNISHED IN AUSTERE GOOD TASTE
A MILD BREEZE BLEW FROM SHORE
AFTER TOUCHING THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN AT LONGITUDE 135 DEGREES IT HEADED WEST-NORTHWEST GOING BACK UP THE WHOLE INTERTROPICAL ZONE
I TOOK ONE LAST LOOK AT THE SEA A LITTLE YELLOWISH NEAR THE LANDING PLACES OF JAPAN AND I WENT BELOW AGAIN TO THE MAIN LOUNGE
THE SEAFLOOR CHANGED LITTLE BY LITTLE
AT SIX O'CLOCK SOMETIMES AFLOAT AND SOMETIMES SUBMERGED THE NAUTILUS PASSED WELL OUT FROM EL TUR WHICH SAT AT THE FAR END OF A BAY WHOSE WATERS SEEMED TO BE DYED RED AS CAPTAIN NEMO HAD ALREADY MENTIONED
WITHOUT THIS PRECAUTION WE WOULDN'T HAVE AWAKENED THE FOLLOWING MORNING
HERE I'M FREE CAPTAIN NEMO SUDDENLY FELL SILENT IN THE MIDST OF THIS ENTHUSIASTIC OUTPOURING
I'M THE CHRONICLER OF DEEDS SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE AND YET INCONTESTABLY REAL
BUT IN THIS CASE THE PROPORTIONS WERE GIGANTIC
JUST THEN CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS CHIEF OFFICER APPEARED
THESE VALUABLE MOLLUSKS STICK TO ROCKS WHERE THEY'RE STRONGLY ATTACHED BY A MASS OF BROWN FILAMENTS THAT FORBIDS THEIR MOVING ABOUT
I STARED UNTIL I NEARLY WENT BLIND FROM A WORN-OUT RETINA WHILE CONSEIL AS STOIC AS EVER KEPT REPEATING TO ME IN A CALM TONE
THEY WERE SAGO PALMS VEGETATION THAT GROWS WITHOUT BEING CULTIVATED
MEDICINE TO THE ANCIENTS JEWELRY TO THE MODERNS IT WASN'T DECISIVELY PLACED IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM UNTIL 1694 BY PEYSONNEL OF MARSEILLES
FROM INSIDE THE BOAT THERE SUDDENLY CAME NOISES OF IRON FASTENINGS PUSHED ROUGHLY ASIDE
BUT I MUST BE IMAGINING THINGS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE I'M BREATHING A SEA BREEZE A SEAMAN COULDN'T BE WRONG ON THIS TOPIC AND I TOLD THE CANADIAN WHAT HAD GONE ON WHILE HE SLEPT
BUT I ONLY KNEW IT AS I DID THE GERMAN LANGUAGE WELL ENOUGH TO READ IT FLUENTLY NOT WELL ENOUGH TO SPEAK IT CORRECTLY
CAPTAIN NEMO REENTERED HIS STATEROOM AND I SAW NO MORE OF HIM FOR A GOOD WHILE
ASSUREDLY NED AND CONSEIL IN COMBINATION ADDED UP TO ONE OUTSTANDING NATURALIST
WHEN I WOKE UP THE NEXT DAY NOVEMBER 17 I SENSED THAT THE NAUTILUS WAS COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS
THEN WE CROSSED A PRAIRIE OF ALGAE OPEN-SEA PLANTS THAT THE WATERS HADN'T YET TORN LOOSE WHOSE VEGETATION GREW IN WILD PROFUSION
A FISHERMAN NED LAND EXCLAIMED
I COULD FEEL ITS SHEET-IRON PLATES TREMBLING DOWN TO THEIR RIVETED JOINS
IT WAS OPEN
SINCE I SAW NO GOOD REASON TO RESIST THE CALL OF SLEEP I FELL INTO A HEAVY DOZE
IN THIS RESPECT OYSTERS ARE INFERIOR EVEN TO MUSSELS TO WHOM NATURE HAS NOT DENIED ALL TALENT FOR LOCOMOTION
ORDER HYDROMEDUSA CONSEIL MUTTERED
WE ALL REENTERED THE INTERIOR
BY EVENING THERE WAS STILL NO IMPROVEMENT IN OUR SITUATION
IT WILL GO FARTHER STILL I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE YOU CAPTAIN I WENT ON IN A TONE OF SOME SARCASM
A FEW MORNING GLEAMS INFILTRATED THE LIQUID STRATA
HOW LONG I WAS SUNK IN THIS TORPOR I CANNOT ESTIMATE
YOU KNOW HOW QUICKLY THE NAUTILUS MOVES
THE NAUTILUS WILL SUFFICE TO DISPERSE THESE SPERM WHALES
TRUNKFISH SPRINKLED WITH WHITE SPOTS ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE BODY WHICH MAKE GOOD HOUSE PETS LIKE CERTAIN BIRDS
NO YEAR COULD BE THAT LONG
I COULD CLEARLY SEE THE SHORE WHICH FEATURED A FEW SPARSE TREES HERE AND THERE
35 AT RANDOM
MANY PEOPLE NED MY FRIEND I SAID
BUT HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO NAVIGATE UNDER THE ICE BANK TO THE OPEN SEA
ROOSTING IN THE SHROUDS THE CREW EXAMINED THE HORIZON WHICH SHRANK AND DARKENED LITTLE BY LITTLE
THE CREW SIDED WITH HIM UNANIMOUSLY
SO THE VERY SIGHT OF IT AROUSED HIS APPETITE AND HE COULDN'T CONTROL HIMSELF
I WANTED TO PRESERVE A FEW SPECIMENS OF THESE DELICATE ZOOPHYTES BUT THEY WERE MERELY CLOUDS SHADOWS ILLUSIONS MELTING AND EVAPORATING OUTSIDE THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT
NO DOUBT THE PAPUANS HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED OFF BY THE MERE SIGHT OF THIS MONSTER AGROUND IN THE BAY BECAUSE OUR HATCHES STAYED OPEN OFFERING EASY ACCESS TO THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR
THE NAUTILUS DEFENDED ITSELF LIKE A HUMAN BEING
I FELL ASLEEP WITH THE FIRM INTENTION OF WAKING UP IN JUST A FEW HOURS
YES MY BOY I REPLIED THEY'RE SOMETIMES FOUND HERE THAT'S NO WHALE CONTINUED NED LAND WHOSE EYES NEVER STRAYED FROM THE OBJECT THEY HAD SIGHTED
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS SITUATION MY TWO COMPANIONS AND I FOUND SEATS ON THE EVER-DESERTED PLATFORM
WHAT ABOUT THESE SAVAGES CONSEIL ASKED ME
WE WERE TRAVELING DUE WEST AND ON JANUARY 11 WE DOUBLED CAPE WESSEL LOCATED IN LONGITUDE 135 DEGREES AND LATITUDE 10 DEGREES NORTH THE WESTERN TIP OF THE GULF OF CARPENTARIA
THE SKIFF WAS PUT AT OUR DISPOSAL FOR THE NEXT MORNING
THE COMMON MAN MAY STILL BELIEVE IN FABULOUS COMETS CROSSING OUTER SPACE OR IN PREHISTORIC MONSTERS LIVING AT THE EARTH'S CORE BUT ASTRONOMERS AND GEOLOGISTS DON'T SWALLOW SUCH FAIRY TALES
NOT A LICK OF IT CONSEIL MY FRIEND THE HARPOONER REPLIED
MUCH TO MY ASTONISHMENT THIS DOOR WAS AJAR
I WORKED IN MY STATEROOM UNTIL NOON WITHOUT SEEING CAPTAIN NEMO EVEN FOR AN INSTANT
YES SIR AND THAT'S THE SUBJECT ON WHICH I WANTED TO CONFER WITH YOU
MY MUSCLES HAD NO POWER TO CONTRACT
NO IN A CHURCH CONSEIL REPLIED
THERE HE HEARD ABOUT DILLON'S FINDINGS AND HE FURTHER LEARNED THAT A CERTAIN JAMES HOBBS CHIEF OFFICER ON THE UNION OUT OF CALCUTTA HAD PUT TO SHORE ON AN ISLAND LOCATED IN LATITUDE 8 DEGREES 18 SOUTH AND LONGITUDE 156 DEGREES 30 EAST AND HAD NOTED THE NATIVES OF THOSE WATERWAYS MAKING USE OF IRON BARS AND RED FABRICS
HAD HE PERISHED
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS I ADMIT THAT WE COULD EASILY HAVE GOTTEN AWAY
HOWEVER THE SHIP HADN'T SUFFERED IN ANY WAY SO SOLIDLY JOINED WAS ITS HULL
BUT AN INCIDENT I REPLIED THAT MAY OBLIGE YOU TO BECOME A RESIDENT AGAIN OF THESE SHORES YOU AVOID CAPTAIN NEMO GAVE ME AN ODD LOOK AND GESTURED NO
BUT MOST INCONVENIENTLY FOR US THE SHIP CAN NO LONGER STEER THEN WE'RE DONE FOR PERHAPS CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
BESIDES THEY WERE EXCELLENT FROM AN EDIBLE VIEWPOINT WITH AN EXQUISITE FLAVOR COMPARABLE TO THE GREEN TURTLE
THE VIEWS OF ARISTOTLE AND PLINY ACCEPTING THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH MONSTERS THEN THE NORWEGIAN STORIES OF BISHOP PONTOPPIDAN THE NARRATIVES OF PAUL EGEDE AND FINALLY THE REPORTS OF CAPTAIN HARRINGTON WHOSE GOOD FAITH IS ABOVE SUSPICION--IN WHICH HE CLAIMS HE SAW WHILE ABOARD THE CASTILIAN IN 1857 ONE OF THOSE ENORMOUS SERPENTS THAT UNTIL THEN HAD FREQUENTED ONLY THE SEAS OF FRANCE'S OLD EXTREMIST NEWSPAPER THE CONSTITUTIONALIST
IN MIDSTAIR HE OPENED A DOOR WENT ALONG THE UPPER GANGWAYS AND ARRIVED AT THE WHEELHOUSE WHICH AS YOU KNOW STANDS AT ONE END OF THE PLATFORM
AT NOON WE'LL FIX OUR POSITION BUT WILL THE SUN SHOW THROUGH THIS MIST I SAID STARING AT THE GRAYISH SKY
THE EXPLANATION HE GIVES SEEMS TO ENTAIL A SET OF CONDITIONS THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS
FROM THE BUTTERFISH GENUS WHOSE OVAL BODIES ARE VERY FLAT I OBSERVED SEVERAL ADORNED IN BRILLIANT COLORS AND SPORTING A DORSAL FIN LIKE A SICKLE EDIBLE FISH THAT WHEN DRIED AND MARINATED MAKE AN EXCELLENT DISH KNOWN BY THE NAME KARAWADE
THEY'RE WHITE OFTEN OPAQUE BUT SOMETIMES OF OPALESCENT TRANSPARENCY AND USUALLY SPHERICAL OR PEAR-SHAPED
THE BEACH WAS STREWN WITH MOLLUSKS
WE WOULD SOON SETTLE THIS IMPORTANT POINT
SO FOR LACK OF ANYTHING BETTER I TALKED TO MYSELF
HE COULD STILL THINK PLAN AND ACT
IT'S DARTING AT US A UNIVERSAL SHOUT WENT UP FROM THE FRIGATE
F
F
I CAN SEE THAT YOU LIKE THE IDEA MR LAND YES
HERE LYING IN SLABS ALL SWOLLEN WITH BLISTERS
HMM I SAID TO MYSELF
THREE MILES OFF IN LATITUDE 8 DEGREES 57 SOUTH AND LONGITUDE 139 DEGREES 32 WEST I SPOTTED MARTIN POINT ON NUKU HIVA CHIEF MEMBER OF THIS ISLAND GROUP THAT BELONGS TO FRANCE
THERE VARIOUS SPECIES OF BIRDS FLEW AND FLUTTERED BY THE THOUSANDS DEAFENING US WITH THEIR CALLS
THEN TURNING TO THE CANADIAN AND CONSEIL
IT HAD THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF REVIVING THE CREW'S FAILING SPIRITS
DON'T SAY THAT CONSEIL ANSWERED
YOU'D THINK A TOTAL DAZE WAS REIGNING ON BOARD
THEY RUBBED THEIR EYES STRETCHED THEIR ARMS AND SPRANG TO THEIR FEET
THE NEXT DAY JANUARY 30 WHEN THE NAUTILUS ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN THERE WAS NO MORE LAND IN SIGHT
THEIR ZINC COMPONENT FOR EXAMPLE
IN THIS CELL WE WERE TO GET DRESSED FOR OUR STROLL
I'M READY TO GO WITH YOU THEN COME ALONG PROFESSOR AND WE'LL GO PUT ON OUR DIVING SUITS ARRIVING AT THE WARDROBE I SAW THAT NEITHER MY COMPANIONS NOR ANY CREWMEN WOULD BE COMING WITH US ON THIS EXCURSION
ELSEWHERE THEY TAKE THE SHAPE OF BARRIER REEFS SUCH AS THOSE THAT EXIST ALONG THE COASTS OF NEW CALEDONIA AND SEVERAL OF THE TUAMOTU ISLANDS
A NEW FEELING APPEARED ON BOARD MADE UP OF THREE-TENTHS SHAME AND SEVEN-TENTHS FURY
WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I FELT HALF SUFFOCATED
OH SIR SIR
HELM HARD TO LEEWARD
AFTER BREAKFAST WE'LL MAKE OUR WAY ASHORE AND CHOOSE AN OBSERVATION POST THIS ISSUE SETTLED I WENT TO FIND NED LAND
I ESTIMATE THAT THIS CAST OF THE NET BROUGHT IN MORE THAN 1,000 POUNDS OF FISH
COMPARED TO THE VAST LIQUID PLAINS OF THE PACIFIC THE MEDITERRANEAN IS A MERE LAKE BUT IT'S AN UNPREDICTABLE LAKE WITH FICKLE WAVES TODAY KINDLY AND AFFECTIONATE TO THOSE FRAIL SINGLE-MASTERS DRIFTING BETWEEN A DOUBLE ULTRAMARINE OF SKY AND WATER TOMORROW BAD-TEMPERED AND TURBULENT AGITATED BY THE WINDS DEMOLISHING THE STRONGEST SHIPS BENEATH SUDDEN WAVES THAT SMASH DOWN WITH A HEADLONG WALLOP
BULKHEADS GROANED
COMMANDER FARRAGUT IN PERSON
I WANTED TO PLUNGE MY EYES THROUGH THE LOUNGE WINDOW AND INTO THESE ATLANTIC WATERS
A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE SUN PASSED ITS ZENITH CAPTAIN NEMO RAISED HIS SEXTANT AND TOOK HIS SIGHTS WITH THE UTMOST PRECISION
I RAISED MY HEAD ONE LAST TIME THEN I COLLAPSED
MORE INTENSE THAN ON LAND MORE ABUNDANT MORE INFINITE SUCH LIFE BLOOMS IN EVERY PART OF THIS OCEAN AN ELEMENT FATAL TO MAN THEY SAY BUT VITAL TO MYRIADS OF ANIMALS--AND TO ME WHEN CAPTAIN NEMO SPOKE IN THIS WAY HE WAS TRANSFIGURED AND HE FILLED ME WITH EXTRAORDINARY EXCITEMENT
I ASK ONLY TO PUT IT TO THE TEST
AFTER I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK SEVERAL PEOPLE DID ME THE HONOR OF CONSULTING ME ON THE PHENOMENON IN QUESTION
THESE ANIMALS ARE COVERED WITH SMALL SCALES OR HAVE NONE AT ALL DEPENDING ON THE SUBGENUS TO WHICH THEY BELONG
ALSO IT'S LIKELY THAT A SIXTH CURRENT USED TO EXIST IN THE NORTHERN INDIAN OCEAN WHEN THE CASPIAN AND ARAL SEAS JOINED UP WITH CERTAIN LARGE ASIAN LAKES TO FORM A SINGLE UNIFORM EXPANSE OF WATER
BUT FORTUNE SMILED ON HIM
HE LOOKED UP SHARPLY WITH A FROWNING BROW AND SAID IN A PRETTY STERN TONE
WAS I FREE OR STILL A PRISONER
CAPTAIN NEMO MUST HAVE SPENT MILLIONS IN ACQUIRING THESE DIFFERENT SPECIMENS AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT FINANCIAL RESOURCES HE TAPPED TO SATISFY HIS COLLECTOR'S FANCIES WHEN THESE WORDS INTERRUPTED ME
THE HATCHES WEREN'T OPEN
THE SHARK BELLOWED SO TO SPEAK
I COULD HEAR THE BEAT OF ITS PROPELLER CHURNING THE WAVES WITH STEADY SPEED
NEVER HAD IDEAS OF SUCH IMPACT RACED THROUGH MY BRAIN
IN OTHER WORDS I COULD VIEW ONLY THE DISTANT HORIZONS BECAUSE THE FOREGROUNDS FLASHED BY LIKE LIGHTNING
I INVITED THEM TO FOLLOW ME NOT TELLING THEM WHERE WE WERE
THEN OUR CONVERSATION SKIMMED VARIOUS SUBJECTS AND WITHOUT BEING MORE FORTHCOMING CAPTAIN NEMO PROVED MORE AFFABLE
I RECALL SEEING THE BAY OF EL TUR COMPLETELY RED LIKE A LAKE OF BLOOD AND YOU ATTRIBUTE THIS COLOR TO THE PRESENCE OF MICROSCOPIC ALGAE YES
TWO MILES TO STARBOARD LAY GUEBOROA ISLAND ITS COASTLINE CURVING NORTH TO WEST LIKE AN IMMENSE ARM
I'M SURE THE CANADIAN WAS SORRY THAT THESE FISHERMEN COULDN'T HARPOON OUR SHEET-IRON CETACEAN AND MORTALLY WOUND IT
THEY SAW NOTHING EXCEPT A STRONG EDDY BREAKING THREE CABLE LENGTHS OUT AS IF THOSE SHEETS OF WATER HAD BEEN VIOLENTLY CHURNED
WHAT WAS HE DOING ALL THE WHILE
FOR THREE MONTHS DURING WHICH EACH DAY SEEMED LIKE A CENTURY THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN PLOWED ALL THE NORTHERLY SEAS OF THE PACIFIC RACING AFTER WHALES SIGHTED ABRUPTLY VEERING OFF COURSE SWERVING SHARPLY FROM ONE TACK TO ANOTHER STOPPING SUDDENLY PUTTING ON STEAM AND REVERSING ENGINES IN QUICK SUCCESSION AT THE RISK OF STRIPPING ITS GEARS AND IT DIDN'T LEAVE A SINGLE POINT UNEXPLORED FROM THE BEACHES OF JAPAN TO THE COASTS OF AMERICA
NED LAND CAN THINK ATTEMPT OR ENDEAVOR ANYTHING HE WANTS WHAT DIFFERENCE IS IT TO ME
ITS CREAM-COLORED TINT PLUS THE STREAKS AND MARKINGS THAT DECORATED IT LIKE SO MANY HIEROGLYPHICS MADE IT A RARE TRINKET
SKY AND WATER MERGED INTO A PERFECTLY CLEAN HORIZON LINE
NEAR TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I WENT TO SNATCH A FEW HOURS OF SLEEP
AT SIX O'CLOCK I ATE SUPPER BUT I HAD NO APPETITE
MANY PEOPLE WOULD WELCOME THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED US JUST TO WALK IN THE MIDST OF THESE WONDERS
THE LATTER WERE MORE WHIMSICAL BUT LESS COLORFUL THAN THE FORMER WHICH KEPT THEIR BLOOM THANKS TO THE MOIST VITALITY OF THE WATERS
IN CANDOR NONE OF THESE SOUNDS LIKE DIVINELY INSPIRED TRUTH
GO AHEAD THEN COMMANDER FARRAGUT CALLED
NED LAND THE COMMANDER ASKED YOU'VE OFTEN HEARD WHALES BELLOWING OFTEN SIR BUT NEVER A WHALE LIKE THIS WHOSE SIGHTING EARNED ME $2,000.00 CORRECT THE PRIZE IS RIGHTFULLY YOURS
NED MY FRIEND I SAID ANSWER ME HONESTLY
THE LIQUID STRATA FARTHEST FROM THE TRENCH NOT WARMED BY THE MOVEMENTS OF WORKMEN AND TOOLS WERE SHOWING A TENDENCY TO SOLIDIFY
THE CANADIAN LEFT ME
I HARDLY NEEDED TO ASK WHETHER CAPTAIN NEMO WOULD BE COMING ALONG
I CLUTCHED HIS HAND
ALL BY ITSELF IT CREATES THESE FEARSOME CYCLONES THROUGH THE DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERATURE BETWEEN ITS CURRENTS AND THE SUPERIMPOSED LAYERS OF AIR
SO THE FLOOR OF THIS SEA HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A BATTLEFIELD WHERE EVERY SHIP DEFEATED BY THE OCEAN STILL LAY SOME ALREADY OLD AND ENCRUSTED OTHERS NEWER AND REFLECTING OUR BEACON LIGHT ON THEIR IRONWORK AND COPPER UNDERSIDES
ACCORDINGLY WALRUSES ARE THE VICTIMS OF A MINDLESS HUNTING THAT SOON WILL DESTROY THEM ALL SINCE THEIR HUNTERS INDISCRIMINATELY SLAUGHTER PREGNANT FEMALES AND YOUNGSTERS AND OVER 4,000 INDIVIDUALS ARE DESTROYED ANNUALLY
IT CONTAINED ONLY A TABLE AND FIVE STOOLS
THE RADIANT ORB CLEARED THE EASTERN HORIZON
IN SHORT A PERFECT LIKENESS OF THE QUARTET NEAR WHICH IT WALKED BUT WITH HEADS DOWN AND FEET IN THE AIR
BUT IT HAD BETTER STILL
ALL AT ONCE THE NAUTILUS STOPPED
IN THE MIDST OF THIS MOVING VEGETATION UNDER ARBORS OF WATER PLANTS THERE RACED LEGIONS OF CLUMSY ARTICULATES IN PARTICULAR SOME FANGED FROG CRABS WHOSE CARAPACES FORM A SLIGHTLY ROUNDED TRIANGLE ROBBER CRABS EXCLUSIVE TO THESE WATERWAYS AND HORRIBLE PARTHENOPE CRABS WHOSE APPEARANCE WAS REPULSIVE TO THE EYE
ASIDE AND IN SPECIAL COMPARTMENTS STRINGS OF SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL PEARLS WERE SPREAD OUT THE ELECTRIC LIGHT FLECKING THEM WITH LITTLE FIERY SPARKS
SEVERAL TIMES DURING VARIOUS LULLS OF WIND AND SEA I THOUGHT I HEARD INDISTINCT SOUNDS A SORT OF ELUSIVE HARMONY PRODUCED BY DISTANT MUSICAL CHORDS
BUT NONE OF THEM REACHED THE NAUTILUS
SUCH A VACUUM ALSO REDUCED WEAR ON THE GRAPHITE POINTS BETWEEN WHICH THE LUMINOUS ARC EXPANDED
AND STEAM SEEMS TO HAVE KILLED OFF ALL GRATITUDE IN SEAMEN'S HEARTS
I WAS FULL OF WONDERMENT AT THIS UNUSUAL MAMMAL WITH ITS CIRCULAR HEAD ADORNED BY SHORT EARS ITS ROUND EYES ITS WHITE WHISKERS LIKE THOSE ON A CAT ITS WEBBED AND CLAWED FEET ITS BUSHY TAIL
NO COLLISIONS TO FEAR BECAUSE IT NAVIGATES THE WATERY DEEP ALL BY ITSELF
HOW MANY VESSELS HAVE RAMMED EACH OTHER DESPITE THEIR RUNNING LIGHTS DESPITE THE WARNINGS GIVEN BY THEIR BOSUN'S PIPES AND ALARM BELLS
OVERLAID WITH SILVER DISH COVERS VARIOUS PLATTERS HAD BEEN NEATLY POSITIONED ON THE TABLE CLOTH AND WE SAT DOWN TO EAT
CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS MUSCULAR COMPANION WERE ALREADY STRETCHED OUT IN THIS CLEAR CRYSTAL SETTING US A FINE NAPTIME EXAMPLE
IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CARIBBEAN SEA YOU CAN SEE THE SANDY BOTTOM WITH STARTLING DISTINCTNESS AS DEEP AS 145 METERS DOWN AND THE PENETRATING POWER OF THE SUN'S RAYS SEEMS TO GIVE OUT ONLY AT A DEPTH OF 300 METERS
BY THEN WE WERE FORCED TO GO BACK DOWN TO THE BEACH BECAUSE THE RIDGE HAD BECOME IMPOSSIBLE
WE WERE THROWN ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE VENTURE WOULD HAVE ENDED HAD NOT THE CANADIAN STILL THIRSTING FOR THE BEAST'S BLOOD FINALLY PIERCED IT TO THE HEART
NOW THEN IT WAS PRECISELY THIS FAMILIARITY THAT WE NEEDED TO PREVENT
DO YOU THINK I'M UNAWARE OF THE SUFFERING BEINGS AND OPPRESSED RACES LIVING ON THIS EARTH POOR PEOPLE TO COMFORT VICTIMS TO AVENGE
BETTER TO BE PRISONERS ABOARD THE NAUTILUS THAN TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF PAPUAN NATIVES
DOES THAT AMAZE YOU WHAT AMAZES ME IS THINKING WE'LL BE THERE THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW OH REALLY YES CAPTAIN ALTHOUGH SINCE I'VE BEEN ABOARD YOUR VESSEL I SHOULD HAVE FORMED THE HABIT OF NOT BEING AMAZED BY ANYTHING BUT WHAT IS IT THAT STARTLES YOU THE THOUGHT OF HOW HIDEOUSLY FAST THE NAUTILUS WILL NEED TO GO IF IT'S TO DOUBLE THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE CIRCLE AROUND AFRICA AND LIE IN THE OPEN MEDITERRANEAN BY THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND WHO SAYS IT WILL CIRCLE AFRICA PROFESSOR
HIS EYES DEVOURED IT
I STARED WILD-EYED
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY ON THE PLATFORM
AND SIMILARLY IF I WANT TO RETURN MORE SWIFTLY TO THE SURFACE I THROW THE PROPELLER IN GEAR AND THE WATER'S PRESSURE MAKES THE NAUTILUS RISE VERTICALLY AS AN AIR BALLOON INFLATED WITH HYDROGEN LIFTS SWIFTLY INTO THE SKIES BRAVO CAPTAIN I EXCLAIMED
HE BELIEVES THAT ESCAPING FROM THE NAUTILUS IS IMPOSSIBLE
AFTER SPENDING SIX MONTHS IN NEBRASKA I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK LADEN WITH VALUABLE COLLECTIONS NEAR THE END OF MARCH
BUT FOR ME THEY HAVE AN ADDED CHARM SINCE I'VE COLLECTED EVERY ONE OF THEM WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS AND NOT A SEA ON THE GLOBE HAS ESCAPED MY INVESTIGATIONS I UNDERSTAND CAPTAIN I UNDERSTAND YOUR DELIGHT AT STROLLING IN THE MIDST OF THIS WEALTH
BUT ONLY A FEW METERS DOWN THE NAUTILUS FELT NO TEMPEST'S FURY AND THE SHIP ROCKED PEACEFULLY IN THE MIDST OF THE CALM WATERS
STARTING THIS VERY DAY YOU'LL ENTER A NEW ELEMENT YOU'LL SEE WHAT NO HUMAN BEING HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE SINCE MY MEN AND I NO LONGER COUNT--AND THANKS TO ME YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN THE ULTIMATE SECRETS OF OUR PLANET I CAN'T DENY IT
WRAPPED IN WHITE FABRIC MADE FROM FILAMENTS OF THE FAN MUSSEL THE BODY WAS LOWERED INTO ITS WATERY GRAVE
THE CEILING LIT UP
FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE STROLLED UP AND DOWN ALL AQUIVER
THE TINY MICROSCOPIC ANIMALS THAT SECRETE THIS POLYPARY LIVE BY THE BILLIONS IN THE DEPTHS OF THEIR CELLS
NOT A SOUND INSIDE NOT A SIGN OF LIFE
AS FOR FISH THEY ALWAYS FILLED US WITH WONDERMENT WHEN STARING THROUGH THE OPEN PANELS WE COULD UNVEIL THE SECRETS OF THEIR AQUATIC LIVES
THIS SERVED AS A TANK FOR THE COMPRESSED AIR WHICH A TRIGGER-OPERATED VALVE COULD RELEASE INTO THE METAL CHAMBER
THEY'RE ROGUES OH GOOD
BLANC AND THE EXTENT OF THESE DEPTHS REMAINED INCALCULABLE
THIS CABLE WILL NO DOUBT LAST INDEFINITELY BECAUSE AS OBSERVERS NOTE ITS GUTTA-PERCHA CASING IS IMPROVED BY A STAY IN SALT WATER
THESE ALONG WITH THE EFFORTS OF CAPTAIN KING ARE THE BEST CHARTS FOR UNTANGLING THE SNARL OF THIS NARROW PASSAGEWAY AND I CONSULTED THEM WITH SCRUPULOUS CARE
BUT WHERE'S THE SOUP COURSE
HIS VOICE WAS NO LONGER SPEAKING IT WAS BELLOWING
A SPIGOT JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE ED
A SPIGOT JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE ED
OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY THE TOTAL IS THE SAME FINE CONSEIL REPLIED I'LL TAKE MASTER'S WORD FOR IT
UNDER MY EYES I HAD THE EXCELLENT CHARTS OF THE TORRES STRAIT THAT HAD BEEN SURVEYED AND DRAWN UP BY THE HYDROGRAPHIC ENGINEER VINCENDON DUMOULIN AND SUBLIEUTENANT NOW ADMIRAL COUPVENT-DESBOIS WHO WERE PART OF DUMONT D'URVILLE'S GENERAL STAFF DURING HIS FINAL VOYAGE TO CIRCUMNAVIGATE THE GLOBE
FROM BETWEEN THEIR STONY KNEES TREES SPRANG UP LIKE JETS UNDER FEARSOME PRESSURE SUPPORTING OTHER TREES THAT SUPPORTED THEM IN TURN
OUR REPLY WILL BE DREADFUL
AND ON THIS SUBJECT A DISPUTE AROSE BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS SINCE BOTH WERE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT FISH BUT FROM TOTALLY DIFFERENT STANDPOINTS
I INFORMED THEM OF CAPTAIN NEMO'S PROPOSITION
TO MY THINKING PROFESSOR ARONNAX THIS RED SEA DESIGNATION MUST BE REGARDED AS A TRANSLATION OF THE HEBREW WORD EDROM AND IF THE ANCIENTS GAVE IT THAT NAME IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE COLOR OF ITS WATERS UNTIL NOW HOWEVER I'VE SEEN ONLY CLEAR WAVES WITHOUT ANY UNIQUE HUE SURELY BUT AS WE MOVE AHEAD TO THE FAR END OF THIS GULF YOU'LL NOTE ITS ODD APPEARANCE
WITHOUT HESITATION I IDENTIFIED HIS DOMINANT QUALITIES SELF-CONFIDENCE SINCE HIS HEAD REARED LIKE A NOBLEMAN'S ABOVE THE ARC FORMED BY THE LINES OF HIS SHOULDERS AND HIS BLACK EYES GAZED WITH ICY ASSURANCE
JUST THE BARE NECESSITIES
IT WASN'T THE ICE BANK AS YET JUST HUGE ICE FIELDS CEMENTED TOGETHER BY THE COLD
I TURN IT ALL OVER TO YOU THAT'S HOW WE ENDED THIS CONVERSATION WHICH LATER WAS TO HAVE SUCH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES
I LISTENED WITH ALL MY SENSES AT ONCE BARELY BREATHING IMMERSED LIKE CAPTAIN NEMO IN THIS MUSICAL TRANCE THAT WAS DRAWING HIM BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF THIS WORLD
HE HAD NO DESIRE TO PASS BEYOND THEM
A TRIGGERFISH I SAID
BUT AS THE BUSHES SHRANK THE TREE FORMS MAGNIFIED
DIVIDED INTO SEVEN COMPARTMENTS BY WATERTIGHT BULKHEADS THE SCOTIA COULD BRAVE ANY LEAK WITH IMPUNITY
AS USUAL DINNER WAS SERVED ME IN MY STATEROOM
I WOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND THE WHIM THAT INDUCED CAPTAIN NEMO TO TAKE US INTO THIS GULF
SO PROFESSOR ARONNAX IF YOU'D LIKE TO EXPLORE THIS CAVERN AND CIRCLE ITS LAGOON SEIZE THE DAY I THANKED THE CAPTAIN AND WENT TO LOOK FOR MY TWO COMPANIONS WHO HADN'T YET LEFT THEIR CABIN
YOU CAN KEEP THE FRESHWATER FISH TERTIO CONSEIL SAID THE SUBBRACHIANS WHOSE PELVIC FINS ARE ATTACHED UNDER THE PECTORALS AND HANG DIRECTLY FROM THE SHOULDER BONE
IN THE QUEBEC MUSEUM BEGGING MASTER'S PARDON CONSEIL ANSWERED BUT THIS SEEMS MORE LIKE THE SOMMERARD ARTIFACTS EXHIBITION MY FRIENDS I REPLIED SIGNALING THEM TO ENTER YOU'RE IN NEITHER CANADA NOR FRANCE BUT SECURELY ABOARD THE NAUTILUS FIFTY METERS BELOW SEA LEVEL IF MASTER SAYS SO THEN SO BE IT CONSEIL ANSWERED
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT MY NAUTILUS WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WATER FOR ITSELF AND THAT LOCALITY IS I ASKED
A FEARSOME EXPLOSION COULDN'T HAVE SLASHED TORN OR SHREDDED THESE FLESHY MASSES WITH GREATER VIOLENCE
AMONG THOSE PROPERLY TERMED SEALS--WHICH HAVE NO EXTERNAL EARS UNLIKE SEA LIONS WHOSE EARS PROTRUDE--I OBSERVED SEVERAL VARIETIES OF THE SPECIES STENORHYNCHUS THREE METERS LONG WITH WHITE HAIR BULLDOG HEADS AND ARMED WITH TEN TEETH IN EACH JAW
I WROTE IT UP IN A STATE OF INTENSE EXCITEMENT
BUT WHAT COULD WE DO
COMMANDER BOUGUER APPROACHED THE ANIMAL AND ATTACKED IT WITH BLOWS FROM HARPOONS AND BLASTS FROM RIFLES BUT WITHOUT MUCH SUCCESS BECAUSE BULLETS AND HARPOONS CROSSED ITS SOFT FLESH AS IF IT WERE SEMILIQUID JELLY
AND SO IT PROVED
IN ANY EVENT IT'S BETTER TO PERISH WITH IT THAN BE ACCOMPLICES IN SOME ACT OF REVENGE WHOSE MERITS WE CAN'T GAUGE THAT'S MY FEELING NED LAND REPLIED COOLLY
THE SEAMAN IN HIM WAS TALKING NOW
THEY HEADED TO THE SOLOMON ISLANDS AND THEY PERISHED WITH ALL HANDS ON THE WESTERLY COAST OF THE CHIEF ISLAND IN THAT GROUP BETWEEN CAPE DECEPTION AND CAPE SATISFACTION AND HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS I EXCLAIMED
I CLIMBED THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY AND GOING ALONG THE UPPER GANGWAY I ARRIVED AT THE SKIFF
THE CHASSEPOT RIFLE LED TO THE TORPEDO AND THE TORPEDO HAS LED TO THIS UNDERWATER BATTERING RAM WHICH IN TURN WILL LEAD TO THE WORLD PUTTING ITS FOOT DOWN
THERE WERE PORT JACKSON SHARKS WITH A BROWN BACK A WHITISH BELLY AND ELEVEN ROWS OF TEETH BIGEYE SHARKS WITH NECKS MARKED BY A LARGE BLACK SPOT ENCIRCLED IN WHITE AND RESEMBLING AN EYE AND ISABELLA SHARKS WHOSE ROUNDED SNOUTS WERE STREWN WITH DARK SPECKLES
THAT DAY THE NAUTILUS WAS PUT TO WORK IN SOME DEPTH-SOUNDING EXPERIMENTS THAT FASCINATED ME DEEPLY
DON'T YOU SEE A MASS THAT SEEMS TO BE MOVING AROUND RIGHT I SAID AFTER OBSERVING CAREFULLY I CAN MAKE OUT SOMETHING LIKE A LONG BLACKISH OBJECT ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER A SECOND NAUTILUS CONSEIL SAID
ON MARCH 5 1867 THE MORAVIAN FROM THE MONTREAL OCEAN CO LYING DURING THE NIGHT IN LATITUDE 27 DEGREES 30 AND LONGITUDE 72 DEGREES 15 RAN ITS STARBOARD QUARTER AFOUL OF A ROCK MARKED ON NO CHARTS OF THESE WATERWAYS
NO I TOLD CONSEIL THAT'S NO MERMAID IT'S AN UNUSUAL CREATURE OF WHICH ONLY A FEW SPECIMENS ARE LEFT IN THE RED SEA
WITH THE CHART UNDER MY EYES I LOOKED FOR THE GULF OF MANNAR
I REALIZED THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE SUDDENLY I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
THIS IS SHEER CRUELTY NO SIR IT'S AN ACT OF MERCY
I HURRIED TO CHANGE INTO THEM AND MY COMPANIONS FOLLOWED SUIT
FOR INSTANCE TO GO 1,000 METERS DOWN I MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REDUCTION IN VOLUME THAT OCCURS UNDER A PRESSURE EQUIVALENT TO THAT FROM A 1,000-METER COLUMN OF WATER IN OTHER WORDS UNDER A PRESSURE OF 100 ATMOSPHERES
HALF LYING ON A COUCH IN THE LIBRARY I WAS SUFFOCATING
THERE WERE RAYS OF GIGANTIC SIZE FIVE METERS LONG AND WITH MUSCLES SO POWERFUL THEY COULD LEAP ABOVE THE WAVES SHARKS OF VARIOUS SPECIES INCLUDING A FIFTEEN-FOOT GLAUCOUS SHARK WITH SHARP TRIANGULAR TEETH AND SO TRANSPARENT IT WAS ALMOST INVISIBLE AMID THE WATERS BROWN LANTERN SHARKS PRISM-SHAPED HUMANTIN SHARKS ARMORED WITH PROTUBERANT HIDES STURGEONS RESEMBLING THEIR RELATIVES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TRUMPET-SNOUTED PIPEFISH A FOOT AND A HALF LONG YELLOWISH BROWN WITH SMALL GRAY FINS AND NO TEETH OR TONGUE UNREELING LIKE SLIM SUPPLE SNAKES
BUT THEN THE DUGONG WOULD STEAL AWAY WITH A SUDDEN DIVE AND IT PROVED IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERTAKE THE BEAST
BUT NOWADAYS STEAMERS PROVIDING SERVICE BETWEEN SUEZ AND THE SOUTH SEAS HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THE FURY OF THIS GULF DESPITE THE CONTRARY WINDS OF ITS MONSOONS
I WAS SO EXHAUSTED FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE I DIDN'T GET UP UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK
I'LL BE REVENGED ON THAT ANIMAL HOW I'LL EAT IT WHICH HE DID THAT SAME EVENING BUT STRICTLY AS RETALIATION
IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT SEA OTTER FROM THE GENUS ENHYDRA THE ONLY EXCLUSIVELY MARINE QUADRUPED
WITHOUT SPEAKING TO US WITHOUT EVEN SEEING US PERHAPS HE WENT TO THE PANEL STARED AT THE DEVILFISH AND SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIS CHIEF OFFICER
MY FEET OFTEN SLIPPED ON THIS VISCOUS SEAWEED CARPET AND WITHOUT MY ALPENSTOCK I WOULD HAVE FALLEN MORE THAN ONCE
NEAR ONE O'CLOCK CAPTAIN NEMO GAVE THE SIGNAL TO HALT
THE AIR HADN'T BEEN RENEWED IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS AND ITS LIFE-GIVING QUALITIES WERE CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED
THE MAIN BALLAST TANKS WERE FILLED WITH THE WATER THAT HADN'T YET CONGEALED AT OUR LINE OF FLOTATION
UNDERNEATH THIS CORAL COVERING I DETECTED SOME RUBBLE THE OLD DREDGES HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO TEAR FREE IRON STIRRUPS ANCHORS CANNONS SHELLS TACKLE FROM A CAPSTAN A STEMPOST ALL OBJECTS HAILING FROM THE WRECKED SHIPS AND NOW CARPETED IN MOVING FLOWERS
SOMETIMES THIS ARMOR TAKES THE SHAPE OF A SOLID TRIANGLE SOMETIMES THAT OF A SOLID QUADRANGLE
FEEL FREE TO SAMPLE ALL OF THESE FOODS
PRIMO THE CYCLOSTOMES WHOSE JAWS ARE FUSED INTO A FLEXIBLE RING AND WHOSE GILL OPENINGS ARE SIMPLY A LARGE NUMBER OF HOLES AN ORDER CONSISTING OF ONLY ONE FAMILY
BUT WHEN THE FIRST ISLANDER LAID HANDS ON THE COMPANIONWAY RAILING HE WAS FLUNG BACKWARD BY SOME INVISIBLE POWER LORD KNOWS WHAT
ITS ENTIRE HULL WAS VIBRATING
AHHH CONSEIL WAS PUTTING IN
I SHOWED MY COMPANIONS THIS SMALL STRAY ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NORTH PACIFIC
THIS IS A SEPARATE WORLD
WHAT ARMOR PLATE NO MATTER HOW HEAVY COULD BEAR THE THRUSTS OF HIS SPUR
YOU WANTED TO SEE SOMETHING NED MY FRIEND
SOME CLADOSTEPHUS VERTICILLATUS PEACOCK'S TAILS FIG-LEAFED CAULERPA GRAIN-BEARING BEAUTY BUSHES DELICATE ROSETANGLE TINTED SCARLET SEA COLANDER ARRANGED INTO FAN SHAPES MERMAID'S CUPS THAT LOOKED LIKE THE CAPS OF SQUAT MUSHROOMS AND FOR YEARS HAD BEEN CLASSIFIED AMONG THE ZOOPHYTES
NO THIS WAS NO LONGER THE CALM EMISSION OF OUR USUAL LIGHTING
I MEAN THE BREADFRUIT TREE WHICH IS QUITE ABUNDANT ON GUEBOROA ISLAND AND THERE I CHIEFLY NOTED THE SEEDLESS VARIETY THAT IN MALAYSIA IS CALLED RIMA THIS TREE IS DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER TREES BY A STRAIGHT TRUNK FORTY FEET HIGH
ONCE PAST THE PETRIFIED FOREST I COULD SEE THE NAUTILUS'S BEACON TWINKLING LIKE A STAR
THUS LED BY THE STRANGEST OF FATES I WAS TREADING UNDERFOOT ONE OF THE MOUNTAINS OF THAT CONTINENT
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU CAPTAIN BUT I'M BUSY SIR I'M AT WORK
I THEREFORE CALCULATED ON EIGHT HOURS OF SWIMMING UNTIL SUNRISE
FUNGUS CORAL SIPHONULA CORAL ALCYON CORAL SEA ANEMONE FROM THE GENUS CARYOPHYLIA PLUS MYRIADS OF CHARMING FISH INCLUDING GREENFISH DAMSELFISH SWEEPERS SNAPPERS AND SQUIRRELFISH
HOW MANY NEW SPECIMENS OF UNDERWATER FLORA AND FAUNA I MARVELED AT BENEATH THE LIGHT OF OUR ELECTRIC BEACON
NEXT CAME SWARMS OF RED MULLET CORSETED IN GOLD STRIPES FROM HEAD TO TAIL THEIR SHINING FINS ALL AQUIVER GENUINE MASTERPIECES OF JEWELRY FORMERLY SACRED TO THE GODDESS DIANA MUCH IN DEMAND BY RICH ROMANS AND ABOUT WHICH THE OLD SAYING GOES
BUT I WAS AWARE THAT MY DEATH THROES HAD BEGUN
MEANWHILE THE NAUTILUS'S SPEED HAD INCREASED APPRECIABLY
BY ANY WORTHWHILE AVAILABLE MEANS WHO HAS DENIED YOU THAT RIGHT CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED
THE CAPTAIN FELL TO THE SEAFLOOR TOPPLED BY THE ENORMOUS MASS WEIGHING HIM DOWN
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THEM SUCH AS THE THERMOMETER WHICH GIVES THE TEMPERATURE INSIDE THE NAUTILUS
BUT MY TWO FRIENDS HAD ALREADY ENCASED THEIR CRANIUMS IN THEIR METAL HEADGEAR AND THEY COULD NEITHER HEAR NOR REPLY
I WENT TO HIM
I ESTIMATED THE WEIGHT OF THIS GIANT CLAM AT 300 KILOGRAMS
I WATCHED HIM MORE AS A NATURALIST THAN AS A MAN IN HUNGER
IN SOME PLACES THEY FORM ATOLLS A CIRCULAR RING SURROUNDING A LAGOON OR SMALL INNER LAKE THAT GAPS PLACE IN CONTACT WITH THE SEA
A WELL-CONSTRUCTED HULL CAN DEFY ANY SEA THIS SUBMERSIBLE WAS NO RESISTING ROCK THAT WAVES COULD DEMOLISH
I HAD BARELY GOTTEN UP FROM MY PASSABLY HARD MATTRESS WHEN I FELT MY MIND CLEAR MY BRAIN GO ON THE ALERT
ANOTHER UNUSUAL EFFECT
I'M UNABLE TO SAY
I'M UNABLE TO SAY
BUT TO MY MIND THIS HYPOTHESIS EXPLAINED ONLY ONE SIDE OF CAPTAIN NEMO
WE WERE APPROACHING WATERWAYS WHERE STORMS ARE COMMONPLACE THE VERY HOMELAND OF TORNADOES AND CYCLONES SPECIFICALLY ENGENDERED BY THE GULF STREAM'S CURRENT
CHAPTER 17 AN UNDERWATER FOREST WE HAD FINALLY ARRIVED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS FOREST SURELY ONE OF THE FINEST IN CAPTAIN NEMO'S IMMENSE DOMAINS
I OBSERVED THAT ALL THESE EXHIBITS FROM THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM WERE ATTACHED TO THE SEAFLOOR BY ONLY THE MOST MAKESHIFT METHODS
IT WAS THE NAME OF THOSE ISLETS WHERE VESSELS UNDER THE COUNT DE LA PéROUSE HAD MISCARRIED
I REENTERED MY STATEROOM VERY PUZZLED AS YOU CAN IMAGINE
STATIONED NEXT TO CONSEIL I EXAMINED THE STRATA SURROUNDING AND SUPPORTING THE NAUTILUS
WAS YOUR HERB GATHERING A SUCCESS YES CAPTAIN I REPLIED BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE BROUGHT BACK A HORDE OF BIPEDS WHOSE PROXIMITY WORRIES ME WHAT SORT OF BIPEDS SAVAGES SAVAGES CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED IN AN IRONIC TONE
THE SHALLOWS DREW NOTICEABLY CLOSER TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND SOON WALKING IN ONLY A METER OF WATER MY HEAD PASSED WELL ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE OCEAN
CONSEIL POUNCED ON HIS RIFLE AND AIMED AT A SAVAGE SWINGING A SLING JUST TEN METERS AWAY FROM HIM
THERE AHEAD TO STARBOARD ALMOST LEVEL WITH THE BEACON
TWO IMPRESSIONS INEVITABLY STOOD OUT
THE NAUTILUS HAD JUST STRUCK A REEF AND IT REMAINED MOTIONLESS LISTING SLIGHTLY TO PORT
THE MORNING SHADOWS WERE LIFTING
BUT HOW SAD DESPAIRING AND IRRESOLUTE HE MUST HAVE FELT TO JUDGE FROM THIS SHIP WHOSE SOUL HE WAS WHICH REFLECTED HIS EVERY MOOD
ON THE FLESH IT LIES LOOSE
THEN I REJOINED NED AND CONSEIL
THE DOUBLE DOOR OPENED AND ACCOMPANIED BY CAPTAIN NEMO WITH A DOZEN CREWMEN FOLLOWING WE SET FOOT ON THE FIRM SEAFLOOR WHERE THE NAUTILUS WAS RESTING TEN METERS DOWN
EVAPORATION WHICH IS NIL IN THE HIGH ARCTIC REGIONS AND VERY ACTIVE IN EQUATORIAL ZONES BRINGS ABOUT A CONSTANT INTERCHANGE OF TROPICAL AND POLAR WATERS
FREEDOM IS WORTH PAYING FOR
WHICH DIDN'T SATISFY THE CANADIAN WHO THAT DAY ASKED ME WHERE WE WERE GOING
I WENT BELOW TO THE LOUNGE
I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT CAPTAIN NEMO'S ABSENCE DURING OUR SESSION THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON AND I HOPED TO SEE HIM AGAIN TODAY
PINK PEARLS PULLED FROM SALTWATER FAN SHELLS IN THE RED SEA
ITS KEEL WAS FORGED BY CREUSOT IN FRANCE ITS PROPELLER SHAFT BY PEN CO
WE SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE
IT MOVED AHEAD AT A SAUNTER SO TO SPEAK
BY DECEMBER 15 WE HAD LEFT THE ALLURING SOCIETY ISLANDS IN THE WEST LIKEWISE ELEGANT TAHITI QUEEN OF THE PACIFIC
HOWEVER I COULD SEE THAT IT HAD NO DIRE CONSEQUENCES NONE SIR
MY HANDS WERE TOUCHING RUINS MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD CONTEMPORARY WITH PREHISTORIC TIMES
BUT IT SEEMED TO BE MADE OF GOLD LEAF
THE NAUTILUS'S COURSE WAS SOUTH-SOUTHWEST
FRANTIC GOING INSANE I LEAPED OUT OF MY STATEROOM AND RUSHED INTO THE LOUNGE
NED IDENTIFIED THE FISH CONSEIL CLASSIFIED THEM AND AS FOR ME I WAS IN ECSTASY OVER THE VERVE OF THEIR MOVEMENTS AND THE BEAUTY OF THEIR FORMS
BAH HE REPLIED
THE HEAVY AIR WAS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT FOR THE FULL PLAY OF MY LUNGS
I'VE CARED FOR YOU WHEN WITH A SINGLE WORD I COULD PLUNGE YOU BACK INTO THE OCEAN DEPTHS
I CAN SEE CAPTAIN NEMO'S BEARING TO THIS DAY
BUT IT WAS IN THE AIR THAT LIFE WAS SUPERABUNDANT
PROFESSOR HE TOLD ME THE SIMPLE LOGIC OF THE NATURALIST LED ME TO DISCOVER THIS PASSAGEWAY AND I ALONE AM FAMILIAR WITH IT
JUST THEN SOMETHING HARD BANGED AGAINST ME
THAT WE'LL ENCOUNTER ADVANTAGEOUS CONDITIONS FOR ESCAPING JUST AS READILY IN SIX MONTHS AS NOW GREAT SCOTT NED LAND PUT IN
HIS FEARSOME SUBMERSIBLE SERVED NOT ONLY HIS QUEST FOR FREEDOM BUT ALSO PERHAPS IT WAS USED IN LORD-KNOWS-WHAT SCHEMES OF DREADFUL REVENGE
IT DREW NEARER ALWAYS MOVING TOWARD THE PHOSPHORESCENT GLOW THAT SIGNALED THE NAUTILUS'S PRESENCE
BUT SCIENCE IN PARTICULAR REPRESENTED THE MAJOR INVESTMENT OF THIS LIBRARY
RIGHT YOUR HELM
THE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS 184 8
AFTER A FEW MINUTES WE HAD CHECKED OUR FALL
AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON JUST BEFORE THAT BRIEF TWILIGHT THAT LINKS DAY WITH NIGHT IN TROPICAL ZONES CONSEIL AND I MARVELED AT AN UNUSUAL SIGHT
AT THE FOOT OF THE LADDER A DOOR OPENED AND INSTANTLY CLOSED BEHIND US WITH A LOUD CLANG
WE MUST COUNTERACT THIS SOLIDIFICATION
I FOUND IT BY THE 9TH PARALLEL OFF THE NORTHWESTERN SHORES OF CEYLON
HOWEVER TO THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S CREDIT IT MUST BE SAID THAT WE STRUGGLED ON WITH TIRELESS PERSISTENCE
AT LEAST SO I THOUGHT
THERE I FOUND CONSEIL WHO WANTED TO KNOW THE UPSHOT OF MY INTERVIEW WITH THE CAPTAIN
DRESSED IN DIVING SUITS CREWMEN WERE BUSY CLEARING AWAY HALF-ROTTED BARRELS AND DISEMBOWELED TRUNKS IN THE MIDST OF THE DINGY HULKS OF SHIPS
WE'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DARKNESS
ASSUREDLY WE WERE DEALING WITH CIVILIZED PEOPLE AND IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THIS ELECTRIC LIGHT FLOODING OVER US I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WERE IN THE DINING ROOM OF THE HOTEL ADELPHI IN LIVERPOOL OR THE GRAND HOTEL IN PARIS
AND I'M DEAD PROFESSOR QUITE AS DEAD AS THOSE FRIENDS OF YOURS SLEEPING SIX FEET UNDER CAPTAIN NEMO FELL SILENT AND SEEMED LOST IN REVERIE
DON'T YOU SEE THESE PEOPLE HAVE A LANGUAGE ALL TO THEMSELVES A LANGUAGE THEY'VE INVENTED JUST TO CAUSE DESPAIR IN DECENT PEOPLE WHO ASK FOR A LITTLE DINNER
FOR WHO COULD PREDICT THE MINIMUM TIME WE WOULD NEED TO FREE OURSELVES
CAPTAIN NEMO HADN'T LEFT IT
OUR FIRST ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE MUST SUCCEED BECAUSE IF IT MISFIRES WE WON'T GET A SECOND CHANCE AND CAPTAIN NEMO WILL NEVER FORGIVE US THAT'S ALSO WELL PUT THE CANADIAN REPLIED
A DREADFUL BATTLE WAS JOINED
THIS TANK IS FASTENED TO THE BACK BY MEANS OF STRAPS LIKE A SOLDIER'S KNAPSACK
DESPITE THE POWERFUL PRESSURES IT WAS UNDERGOING THE NAUTILUS SANK STILL DEEPER
I CAN DO NO BETTER THAN TO COMPARE HIM WITH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE THAT COULD DOUBLE AS A CANNON ALWAYS READY TO FIRE
BUT NO AQUATIC GAME WORTHY OF A GUNSHOT HAD YET BEEN OFFERED TO OUR EYES
ALL THESE WONDERS I GLIMPSED IN THE SPACE OF A QUARTER OF A MILE BARELY PAUSING FOLLOWING CAPTAIN NEMO WHOSE GESTURES KEPT BECKONING ME ONWARD
AFTER TWO HOURS OF WORK REENTERING TO SNATCH SOME FOOD AND REST I FOUND A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CLEAN ELASTIC FLUID SUPPLIED ME BY THE ROUQUAYROL DEVICE AND THE NAUTILUS'S ATMOSPHERE WHICH WAS ALREADY CHARGED WITH CARBON DIOXIDE
BUT HELPED BY THE CANADIAN'S STRENGTH AND CONSEIL'S DEXTERITY WE OVERCAME EVERY OBSTACLE
THE COMMON NARWHALE OR SEA UNICORN OFTEN REACHES A LENGTH OF SIXTY FEET
DARK DENSE SMOKE BURST FROM ITS TWO FUNNELS
TWENTY TIMES A DAY SOME ERROR IN PERCEPTION OR THE OPTICAL ILLUSIONS OF SOME SAILOR PERCHED IN THE CROSSTREES WOULD CAUSE INTOLERABLE ANGUISH AND THIS EMOTION REPEATED TWENTY TIMES OVER KEPT US IN A STATE OF IRRITABILITY SO INTENSE THAT A REACTION WAS BOUND TO FOLLOW
BUT AS TO WHETHER THEY'RE SPANIARDS TURKS ARABS OR EAST INDIANS THEIR PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS DON'T GIVE ME ENOUGH TO GO ON
AND IT'S SAD TO THINK THAT THIS DEED WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN INTERNATIONAL DEED WHICH WOULD HAVE INSURED THAT ANY ADMINISTRATION WENT DOWN IN HISTORY WILL SUCCEED ONLY THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF ONE MAN
EIGHT YEARS LATER THE COMPANY'S ASSETS WERE INCREASED BY FOUR 650-HORSEPOWER SHIPS AT 1,820 METRIC TONS AND IN TWO MORE YEARS BY TWO OTHER VESSELS OF STILL GREATER POWER AND TONNAGE
AND ON JANUARY 30 1774 ALONG THE 109TH MERIDIAN HE REACHED LATITUDE 71 DEGREES 15 IN 1819 THE RUSSIAN BELLINGHAUSEN LAY ON THE 69TH PARALLEL AND IN 1821 ON THE 66TH AT LONGITUDE 111 DEGREES WEST
SO I WENT DOWN THE HATCH AND BACK THROUGH THE GANGWAYS TO MY STATEROOM
BUT ULTIMATELY I FEEL LESS SORRY FOR THEM THAN FOR THE THOUSANDS OF UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE BENEFITED FROM A FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF THIS WEALTH WHEREAS NOW IT WILL BE OF NO HELP TO THEM NO SOONER HAD I VOICED THIS REGRET THAN I FELT IT MUST HAVE WOUNDED CAPTAIN NEMO
THIS BREACH IN THE SHEET IRON WAS SO PERFECTLY FORMED NO PUNCH COULD HAVE DONE A CLEANER JOB OF IT
THESE FORESTS AREN'T ON LAND THEY'RE ACTUAL UNDERWATER FORESTS UNDERWATER FORESTS I EXCLAIMED
HE SAID YOU'D ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS LITTLE STROLL INDEED I SAID
AND SINCE THANKS TO IT TRAVEL BETWEEN THE VARIOUS CONTINENTS HAD BECOME MORE AND MORE DANGEROUS THE PUBLIC SPOKE UP AND DEMANDED STRAIGHT OUT THAT AT ALL COST THE SEAS BE PURGED OF THIS FEARSOME CETACEAN
I CLOSED THE BOOK AND RESUMED MY STROLLING
THESE DESERTED WATERS WERE WONDERFULLY CLEAR WITH A TRANSPARENCY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS ONE OF US WILL BE PLEASED
COMING FROM WELL OUT A MILD SWELL MADE THE SKIFF ROLL GENTLY AND A FEW CRESTING BILLOWS LAPPED AT ITS BOW
IT OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T WANT TO FREQUENT THE WAVES OF THE GULF OF MEXICO OR THE CARIBBEAN SEA
THEY REPAIRED THE JOINT AND ITS SPLICE
A FEW HARMLESS SNAKES FLED UNDERFOOT
DURING THAT DAY A FEARSOME SCHOOL OF SHARKS PROVIDED US WITH AN ESCORT
CAPTAIN NEMO LED ME TO THE GALLEY WHERE A HUGE DISTILLING MECHANISM WAS AT WORK SUPPLYING DRINKING WATER VIA EVAPORATION
NED LAND HOPED FOR BETTER LUCK IN HIS HUNTING THAN ON THE DAY BEFORE AND HE WANTED TO VISIT A DIFFERENT PART OF THE FOREST
THE SAVAGES APPROACHED WITHOUT RUNNING BUT THEY FAVORED US WITH A SHOW OF THE GREATEST HOSTILITY
ALL THE SAME OUR CHANCES WERE AUTOMATICALLY PRETTY LIMITED
WHERE HAD NATURE LEARNED THE SECRET OF THEIR VEGETATING EXISTENCE AND FOR HOW MANY CENTURIES HAD THEY LIVED IN THE OCEAN'S LOWER STRATA
THE BLADES OF THE PROPELLER CHURNED THE WAVES WITH INCREASING SPEED AND THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN MOVED OUT MAJESTICALLY AMID A SPECTATOR-LADEN ESCORT OF SOME 100 FERRIES AND TENDERS AUTHOR'S NOTE
CALCULATE THEN HOW MUCH RESISTANCE OF BONE STRUCTURE AND STRENGTH OF CONSTITUTION THEY'D NEED IN ORDER TO WITHSTAND SUCH PRESSURES THEY'D NEED TO BE MANUFACTURED NED LAND REPLIED FROM SHEET-IRON PLATES EIGHT INCHES THICK LIKE IRONCLAD FRIGATES RIGHT NED AND THEN PICTURE THE DAMAGE SUCH A MASS COULD INFLICT IF IT WERE LAUNCHED WITH THE SPEED OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN AGAINST A SHIP'S HULL YES INDEED MAYBE THE CANADIAN REPLIED STAGGERED BY THESE FIGURES BUT STILL NOT WILLING TO GIVE IN
THIS WAS THE EXTENT OF HIS REMARKS
UNINTENTIONALLY THE STRANGER REPLIED RAISING HIS VOICE A LITTLE
BECAUSE THE WATER SURROUNDS ME BUT DOESN'T PENETRATE ME PRECISELY NED
SIGNED WITH MY NAME COMPLETE WITH MY LIFE STORY THIS MANUSCRIPT WILL BE ENCLOSED IN A SMALL UNSINKABLE CONTRIVANCE
IT SEEMED TO BE TRAVELING AT RANDOM AS IF HESITATING OVER WHICH COURSE TO FOLLOW BUT IT NEVER CROSSED THE TROPIC OF CANCER
CAPTAIN I SAID
THESE NAMES MAY LOOK A TAD FIERCE BUT THEY'RE ACCURATE AND APPROPRIATE
HOLLOWED FROM TREE TRUNKS THESE DUGOUTS WERE LONG NARROW AND WELL DESIGNED FOR SPEED KEEPING THEIR BALANCE BY MEANS OF TWO BAMBOO POLES THAT FLOATED ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
AMONG BONY FISH I NOTED GRIZZLED WRASSE UNIQUE TO THESE SEAS DEEP-WATER GILTHEAD WHOSE IRIS HAS A FIERY GLEAM ONE-METER CROAKERS WHOSE LARGE MOUTHS BRISTLE WITH SMALL TEETH AND WHICH LET OUT THIN CRIES BLACK RUDDERFISH LIKE THOSE I'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED BLUE DORADOS ACCENTED WITH GOLD AND SILVER RAINBOW-HUED PARROTFISH THAT CAN RIVAL THE LOVELIEST TROPICAL BIRDS IN COLORING BANDED BLENNIES WITH TRIANGULAR HEADS BLUISH FLOUNDER WITHOUT SCALES TOADFISH COVERED WITH A CROSSWISE YELLOW BAND IN THE SHAPE OF A GREEK T SWARMS OF LITTLE FRECKLED GOBIES STIPPLED WITH BROWN SPOTS LUNGFISH WITH SILVER HEADS AND YELLOW TAILS VARIOUS SPECIMENS OF SALMON MULLET WITH SLIM FIGURES AND A SOFTLY GLOWING RADIANCE THAT LACéPèDE DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF HIS WIFE AND FINALLY THE AMERICAN CAVALLA A HANDSOME FISH DECORATED BY EVERY HONORARY ORDER BEDIZENED WITH THEIR EVERY RIBBON FREQUENTING THE SHORES OF THIS GREAT NATION WHERE RIBBONS AND ORDERS ARE HELD IN SUCH LOW ESTEEM
MUTE GLOOMY IMPLACABLE HE WAS STARING THROUGH THE PORT PANEL
IF IT ISN'T THE RIGHT BIRD IT'S STILL THE RIGHT FEATHERS AND SO LONG AS THE MERCHANDISE ISN'T MEANT TO BE EATEN I SEE NO GREAT HARM BUT IF MY DESIRES WERE FULFILLED BY THE CAPTURE OF THIS BIRD OF PARADISE THOSE OF OUR CANADIAN HUNTSMAN REMAINED UNSATISFIED
WHERE WAS I
WHERE WAS I
NED LAND WAS RIGHT A HUNDRED TIMES OVER
ARE THESE ANIMALS DANGEROUS CONSEIL ASKED ME
SO KEEP CALM AND LET'S SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND US SEE THE HARPOONER EXCLAIMED
MY DIVING SUIT REMOVED I WENT WITH HIM TO THE LOUNGE
JUST THEN COMMANDER FARRAGUT WAS GIVING ORDERS TO CAST OFF THE LAST MOORINGS HOLDING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN TO ITS BROOKLYN PIER
HOW MANY OTHER MARVELOUS NEW SPECIMENS I STILL COULD HAVE OBSERVED IF LITTLE BY LITTLE THE NAUTILUS HADN'T SETTLED TO THE LOWER STRATA
THE WALLS WERE APPROACHING THE VERTICAL
BUT INSTEAD OF COILING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT THIS OLIVE SHELL ROLLS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IT CAN'T BE CONSEIL EXCLAIMED
NEAR MIDNIGHT SEEING THAT ALL WAS QUIET OVER THE DARKENED WAVES AS WELL AS UNDER THE WATERSIDE TREES I REPAIRED TO MY CABIN AND FELL INTO A PEACEFUL SLEEP
I WAS NAVIGATING TWO METERS BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEN THE COLLISION OCCURRED
BUT IN YOUR HONOR I'LL USE THE ONE FOR PARIS THIS REPLY TOLD ME NOTHING
THERE HE ADDED OUT THERE LIES TRUE EXISTENCE
WE'RE DEPARTING IN TWO HOURS AS MASTER WISHES CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY
BUT THAT STROKE FROM THE SHARK'S TAIL COULD HAVE BEEN HIS DEATHBLOW
IF THEY SLANT THE NAUTILUS FOLLOWS THE ANGLE OF THAT SLANT AND UNDER ITS PROPELLER'S THRUST EITHER SINKS ON A DIAGONAL AS STEEP AS IT SUITS ME OR RISES ON THAT DIAGONAL
INSTEAD OF CONTINUING NORTH THE NAUTILUS TOOK AN EASTERLY HEADING AS IF TO GO ALONG THIS PLATEAU ON WHICH THE TELEGRAPH CABLE RESTS WHERE MULTIPLE SOUNDINGS HAVE GIVEN THE CONTOURS OF THE TERRAIN WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY
IN THE NORTHEAST THERE EMERGED TWO VOLCANIC ISLANDS OF UNEQUAL SIZE SURROUNDED BY A CORAL REEF WHOSE CIRCUIT MEASURED FORTY MILES
WHAT IF WE DON'T RETURN TO THE NAUTILUS THIS EVENING CONSEIL SAID
I HEARD ITS TEETH GRIND ON SHEET IRON AND THE DUGONG DISAPPEARED TAKING OUR HARPOON ALONG WITH IT
AND IF ONE OF THESE ANIMALS WENT FROM THE BERING STRAIT TO THE DAVIS STRAIT IT'S QUITE SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE'S SOME PASSAGEWAY FROM THE ONE SEA TO THE OTHER EITHER ALONG THE COASTS OF CANADA OR SIBERIA YOU EXPECT US TO FALL FOR THAT THE CANADIAN ASKED TIPPING ME A WINK
EVERY BIRD HAD DISAPPEARED EXCEPT A FEW PETRELS FRIENDS OF THE STORMS
BUT IT HAD HEELED SIDEWAYS FILLING COMPLETELY AND IT WAS LISTING TO PORT EVEN YET
AS MASTER WISHES 10 4
EIGHT MILES TO LEEWARD PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAN YOU SEE THOSE BLACKISH SPECKS MOVING ABOUT YES CAPTAIN I REPLIED
YES MY BOY
YES MY BOY
I WOULD HAVE STAYED LONGER AT MY WINDOW MARVELING AT THESE BEAUTIES OF SEA AND SKY BUT THE PANELS CLOSED
AND WHAT MR LAND BREAK OUT OF HERE BREAKING OUT OF A PRISON ON SHORE IS DIFFICULT ENOUGH BUT WITH AN UNDERWATER PRISON IT STRIKES ME AS COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE COME NOW NED MY FRIEND CONSEIL ASKED HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER MASTER'S OBJECTION
THERE WERE MIMOSAS BANYAN TREES BEEFWOOD TEAKWOOD HIBISCUS SCREW PINES PALM TREES ALL MINGLING IN WILD PROFUSION
THE ALARMING IDEA OF SHARKS CROSSED MY MIND
THEY GO OFF AT THE SLIGHTEST IMPACT AND THE ANIMAL NO MATTER HOW STRONG DROPS DEAD
BUT IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY WHEN I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE
WHO COULD PORTRAY THE EFFECTS OF THIS LIGHT THROUGH THESE TRANSLUCENT SHEETS OF WATER THE SUBTLETY OF ITS PROGRESSIVE SHADINGS INTO THE OCEAN'S UPPER AND LOWER STRATA
CHAPTER 18 THE DEVILFISH FOR SOME DAYS THE NAUTILUS KEPT VEERING AWAY FROM THE AMERICAN COAST
THE COMMANDER HADN'T PUT A QUESTION TO ME
OUR HEADING WAS STILL NORTHERLY
THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN HAD DONE EVERYTHING IT COULD TO SUCCEED AND HAD NO REASON TO BLAME ITSELF
IT'S FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE NOON
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO WISH TO PROBE THOSE SECRETS OF YOURS
WE TURNED ON OUR RUHMKORFF DEVICES AND WENT ALONG A CORAL SHOAL IN THE PROCESS OF FORMING WHICH GIVEN TIME WILL SOMEDAY CLOSE OFF THIS WHOLE PART OF THE INDIAN OCEAN
I'M WRITING OF THIS BOLD COMPANION AS I CURRENTLY KNOW HIM
ON THIS SCORE IT'S INFERIOR TO ITS NEIGHBORS THE CASPIAN SEA AND THE DEAD SEA WHOSE LEVELS LOWER ONLY TO THE POINT WHERE THEIR EVAPORATION EXACTLY EQUALS THE AMOUNTS OF WATER THEY TAKE TO THEIR HEARTS
CONSEIL STAYED CALM
THEIR HIDES WERE ROUGH AND HEAVY A TAN COLOR LEANING TOWARD A REDDISH BROWN
SECUNDO CONSEIL WENT ON THE ABDOMINALS WHOSE PELVIC FINS HANG UNDER THE ABDOMEN TO THE REAR OF THE PECTORALS BUT AREN'T ATTACHED TO THE SHOULDER BONE AN ORDER THAT'S DIVIDED INTO FIVE FAMILIES AND MAKES UP THE GREAT MAJORITY OF FRESHWATER FISH
WE'RE LEAVING ON THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN AS MASTER THINKS BEST CONSEIL REPLIED PLACIDLY
ARMS CROSSED LEANING AGAINST A CORNER OF THE TABLE THE COMMANDER STUDIED US WITH GREAT CARE
THE LONGBOAT FLEW OVER THE WAVES
THE HUNT WAS ON AGAIN AND COMMANDER FARRAGUT LEANED OVER TO ME SAYING
THEY DIDN'T ASK THEIR HOSTS FOR SUSTENANCE JUST A POINT OF PURCHASE
FARTHER OFF THE REMAINS OF A GIGANTIC AQUEDUCT
THE NAUTILUS SANK A FEW METERS BENEATH THE WAVES AND THE PANELS OPENED
YOU TALK ABOUT SPERM WHALES HE SAID AS IF THEY WERE LITTLE BEASTS
ON JANUARY 1 1868 BRIGHT AND EARLY CONSEIL JOINED ME ON THE PLATFORM
IT LOSES ITS SPEED AND TEMPERATURE BUT IT TURNS INTO A SEA
I FELT A DISTINCT SENSATION OF COLD RISING FROM MY FEET TO MY CHEST
SOON FROM CERTAIN ROLLING AND PITCHING MOVEMENTS I SENSED THAT THE NAUTILUS HAD LEFT THE LOWER STRATA AND WAS BACK ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
CAPTAIN NEMO HAD LEFT HIS STATEROOM
BUT CONSEIL AND I WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE THOSE MEDITERRANEAN FISH WHOSE POWERFUL FINS KEPT PACE FOR A WHILE IN THE NAUTILUS'S WATERS
BUT THE MOST ASTONISHING EVENT WHICH PROVES THAT THESE GIGANTIC ANIMALS UNDENIABLY EXIST TOOK PLACE A FEW YEARS AGO IN 1861 WHAT EVENT WAS THAT NED LAND ASKED
THE ZEALOUS AND THE NEW ASTROLABE WELLNIGH PERISHED BUT MY NAUTILUS IS IN NO DANGER
THEY ALL CENTERED ON THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER
I WANTED TO TAKE HIM WITH ME
NED LAND HADN'T MISSED HIS TARGET
I WAS LEADING THE WAY I WAS OUT IN FRONT BUT NO YOU SILLY FOOL
I TOOK A SEAT IN THE LOUNGE WITH CONSEIL
WAS IT UNINTENTIONALLY THAT YOUR SHELLS BOUNCED OFF MY SHIP'S HULL
ITS TREE GREW TALL CATCHING STEAM OFF THE WATER
I SENSED THAT WE WERE NO LONGER NAVIGATING UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS
THIS IS THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ACCOUNT I GAVE CAPTAIN NEMO
THEN SIR NED LAND SAID SINCE CONSEIL IS NO MORE WE'LL HAVE THIS DISCUSSION BETWEEN JUST THE TWO OF US
CONSEIL I REPEATED WHILE FEVERISHLY BEGINNING MY PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE
WE ARRIVED AT A PRELIMINARY PLATEAU WHERE STILL OTHER SURPRISES WERE WAITING FOR ME
PLACED ON OUR BACKS THE ROUQUAYROL DEVICE WENT INTO OPERATION AS SOON AS IT WAS IN POSITION AND FOR MY PART I COULD BREATHE WITH EASE
MY BLOOD WOULD CURDLE AS I WATCHED SOME ENORMOUS ANTENNA BAR MY PATH OR SAW SOME FRIGHTFUL PINCER SNAP SHUT IN THE SHADOW OF SOME CAVITY
SIR I REPLIED FLARING UP IN SPITE OF MYSELF YOU'RE TAKING UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OF US
AND YET WHAT MONSTERS THESE DEVILFISH ARE WHAT VITALITY OUR CREATOR HAS GIVEN THEM WHAT VIGOR IN THEIR MOVEMENTS THANKS TO THEIR OWNING A TRIPLE HEART
I'D RATHER HE CRACKED MY SHOULDER CONSEIL WAS IN DEAD EARNEST BUT I DIDN'T SUBSCRIBE TO HIS VIEWS
BUT MY GALLANT NED I TOLD HIM THE FORESTS OF CRESPO ISLAND ARE SIMPLY UNDERWATER FORESTS OH GREAT PUT IN THE DISAPPOINTED HARPOONER WATCHING HIS DREAMS OF FRESH MEAT FADE AWAY
WE DIDN'T LEAVE THESE PATAGONIAN WATERWAYS UNTIL APRIL 3 SOMETIMES CRUISING UNDER THE OCEAN SOMETIMES ON ITS SURFACE
ALL THIS DISMAL SILENCE WAS TERRIFYING
FOR SEVERAL HOURS THAT DAY I WIELDED MY PICK DOGGEDLY
LIKE THE CONTINENTS THE SEA HAS ITS RIVERS
OUR PROPELLER DID FORTY-THREE REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE AND STEAM SHOT FROM THE VALVES
I DON'T WANT YOUR WRECKAGE MINGLING WITH THAT OF THE AVENGER I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM
BUT CONSEIL WAS SO DISTRACTED HE BARELY HEARD ME AND HIS LACK OF INTEREST IN ANY COMMENTARY ON THIS HISTORICAL TOPIC WAS SOON EXPLAINED
IT WAS RAINING STONES AND ARROWS
I DOUBT IT MR LAND
YES PROFESSOR
WHAT WAS HE DOING JUST THEN
I HAD READ AND REREAD EVERY AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN NEWSPAPER WITHOUT BEING ANY FARTHER ALONG
LAST NIGHT YES LAST NIGHT IN A MATTER OF MINUTES WE CLEARED THAT INSUPERABLE ISTHMUS I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT THE CANADIAN REPLIED
HOW DID THE COMMANDER OF THIS AQUATIC RESIDENCE GO ABOUT IT
A HALF HOUR OF NIGHTMARES THAT COULD DRIVE ME INSANE
THIS OCCURRENCE EXTREMELY SERIOUS IN ITSELF MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN LIKE SO MANY OTHERS IF THREE WEEKS LATER IT HADN'T BEEN REENACTED UNDER IDENTICAL CONDITIONS
WELL DID YOU HAVE A HAPPY HUNT
I REPORTED THIS CONVERSATION TO MY TWO COMPANIONS
YET IN LEAVING HIM I COULDN'T BE ACCUSED OF INGRATITUDE
BEFORE THE NAUTILUS'S SPUR THERE STRETCHED THE DANGEROUS WATERWAYS OF THE CORAL SEA OFF THE NORTHEAST COAST OF AUSTRALIA
VERNE REWORKED ITS POLITICAL CONTENT DEVISING NEW NATIONALITIES FOR NEMO AND HIS GREAT ENEMY--INFORMATION REVEALED ONLY IN A LATER NOVEL THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND 1875
AT SIX O'CLOCK DAY BEGAN TO BREAK AND WITH THE DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT THE NARWHALE'S ELECTRIC GLOW DISAPPEARED
BESIDES WHO ELSE COULD DISPUTE HIS OWNERSHIP OF THIS UNDERWATER PROPERTY
JUST MAYBE PROFESSOR ARONNAX BUT NED YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL WHALER A MAN FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE GREAT MARINE MAMMALS--YOUR MIND SHOULD EASILY ACCEPT THIS HYPOTHESIS OF AN ENORMOUS CETACEAN AND YOU OUGHT TO BE THE LAST ONE TO DOUBT IT UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT'S JUST WHERE YOU'RE MISTAKEN PROFESSOR NED REPLIED
I'M GOING TO RISE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER THE CAPTAIN PRESSED AN ELECTRIC BELL THREE TIMES
BUT I HAVE THE SKIFF READY AND IT WILL TAKE US TO THE EXACT SPOT WHERE WE'LL DISEMBARK WHICH WILL SAVE US A PRETTY LONG TREK
FROM THIS MOMENT ON FOR NINETEEN DAYS FROM FEBRUARY 23 TO MARCH 12 THE NAUTILUS STAYED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC HUSTLING US ALONG AT A CONSTANT SPEED OF 100 LEAGUES EVERY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
SOME OF THE CHIEFTAINS ADORNED THEIR NECKS WITH CRESCENTS AND WITH NECKLACES MADE FROM BEADS OF RED AND WHITE GLASS
SEVERAL TIMES TEN OR TWELVE OF THEM TEAMED UP TRYING TO CRUSH THE NAUTILUS WITH THEIR SHEER MASS
THEN HE AND CONSEIL LEFT ME
SOON I HAD PUT ON MY CLOTHES WHICH WERE WOVEN FROM STRANDS OF SEASHELL TISSUE
WHOEVER BOARDS THE NAUTILUS MUST NEVER LEAVE IT WHAT YOU'RE INFLICTING ON US IS OUTRIGHT SLAVERY CALL IT ANYTHING YOU LIKE BUT EVERY SLAVE HAS THE RIGHT TO RECOVER HIS FREEDOM
AS FOR THOSE BILLIONS OF TINY ANIMALS HE WENT ON THOSE INFUSORIA THAT LIVE BY THE MILLIONS IN ONE DROPLET OF WATER 800,000 OF WHICH ARE NEEDED TO WEIGH ONE MILLIGRAM THEIR ROLE IS NO LESS IMPORTANT
ARMS GREW WEARY HANDS WERE RUBBED RAW BUT WHO CARED ABOUT EXHAUSTION WHAT DIFFERENCE WERE WOUNDS
AND AS SOON AS THE ANIMAL IS HIT NO MATTER HOW LIGHTLY IT FALLS AS IF STRUCK BY LIGHTNING WHY BECAUSE THIS RIFLE DOESN'T SHOOT ORDINARY BULLETS BUT LITTLE GLASS CAPSULES INVENTED BY THE AUSTRIAN CHEMIST LENIEBROEK AND I HAVE A CONSIDERABLE SUPPLY OF THEM
HIS AX DISAPPEARED BETWEEN THE TWO ENORMOUS MANDIBLES AND THE CANADIAN MIRACULOUSLY SAVED STOOD AND PLUNGED HIS HARPOON ALL THE WAY INTO THE DEVILFISH'S TRIPLE HEART
THAT GAVE US 4,000 FEET OF ICE OVERHEAD OF WHICH 1,000 FEET EMERGED ABOVE WATER
A HIDEOUS COLLISION OCCURRED AND THROWN OVER THE RAIL WITH NO TIME TO CATCH HOLD OF IT I WAS HURLED INTO THE SEA
IT HAPPENED THE MORNING OF JANUARY 15
CONSEIL LOOKED AT IT WITH PURELY SCIENTIFIC FASCINATION AND I'M SURE HE PLACED IT NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON IN THE CLASS OF CARTILAGINOUS FISH ORDER CHONDROPTERYGIA WITH FIXED GILLS FAMILY SELACIA GENUS SQUALUS
HIS EYES WERE FOCUSED ON THE NORTHERN HORIZON ALONG WHICH THE SUN WAS SWEEPING IN ITS EXTENDED ARC
HE QUESTIONED ME WITH INTEREST ON OUR EXCURSIONS ASHORE AND ON OUR HUNTING BUT SEEMED NOT TO UNDERSTAND THE CANADIAN'S PASSIONATE CRAVING FOR RED MEAT
ONE DAY CARRIED OFF BY A HURRICANE FROM NEIGHBORING SHORES SOME SEED FELL ONTO THESE LIMESTONE BEDS MIXING WITH DECOMPOSED PARTICLES OF FISH AND MARINE PLANTS TO FORM VEGETABLE HUMUS
OUR BEARINGS HADN'T BEEN MARKED ON THE CHART PERHAPS DELIBERATELY--AND I HAD NO IDEA WHAT OUR POSITION WAS
JUST THEN--WAS IT DUE TO SOME PERSONAL INDISPOSITION?--I FELT EXTREMELY HOT AND HAD TO TAKE OFF MY JACKET MADE OF FAN MUSSEL FABRIC
COMING LATER CAPTAIN COOK IN 1774 REAR ADMIRAL D'ENTRECASTEAUX IN 1793 AND FINALLY CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE IN 1827 UNTANGLED THE WHOLE CHAOTIC GEOGRAPHY OF THIS ISLAND GROUP
I DON'T SEE ANY FISH WHY WOULD YOU CARE NED MY FRIEND CONSEIL REPLIED
A CANNON GOING OFF NED LAND REPLIED
I THOUGHT MY HEARING HAD GONE BAD
FROM THERE I COULD HEAR MOVEMENTS INSIDE CAPTAIN NEMO'S QUARTERS
CAPTAIN I WENT ON TOUCHING HIM WITH MY HAND
CHAPTER 12 SPERM WHALES AND BALEEN WHALES DURING THE NIGHT OF MARCH 13-14 THE NAUTILUS RESUMED ITS SOUTHWARD HEADING
IN ANOTHER FORTY-EIGHT HOURS OUR RESERVE AIR WILL BE USED UP WELL THEN CAPTAIN LET'S FREE OURSELVES WITHIN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS WE'LL TRY TO AT LEAST BY CUTTING THROUGH ONE OF THESE WALLS SURROUNDING US WHICH ONE I ASKED
BY LEAVING THE PEARL BURIED BENEATH THE GIANT CLAM'S MANTLE HE ALLOWED IT TO GROW IMPERCEPTIBLY
WE HAD BEEN GONE FROM THE NAUTILUS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF
AN UNBEARABLE HEAVINESS WEIGHED ME DOWN
IN ANY EVENT WE'RE ALREADY CLEAR THE CANADIAN REPLIED BECAUSE WE'RE AFLOAT THE NAUTILUS WAS CERTAINLY AFLOAT BUT IT WAS NO LONGER IN MOTION
WE WERE SEATED ON THE PLATFORM NEXT TO A TRANQUIL SEA
ABOARD A CONVENTIONAL SHIP FACING THE OCEAN'S PERILS DANGER LURKS EVERYWHERE
OTHER RAYS PASSED BY SO QUICKLY I COULDN'T TELL IF THEY DESERVED THAT NAME EAGLE RAY COINED BY THE ANCIENT GREEKS OR THOSE DESIGNATIONS OF RAT RAY BAT RAY AND TOAD RAY THAT MODERN FISHERMEN HAVE INFLICTED ON THEM
AFTER CRUISING ALONG THE CARTIER HIBERNIA SERINGAPATAM AND SCOTT REEFS THE SOLID ELEMENT'S LAST EXERTIONS AGAINST THE LIQUID ELEMENT WE WERE BEYOND ALL SIGHT OF SHORE BY JANUARY 14
AND TRUST ME ON THIS
HE HAD THUMBED THROUGH MY WORK ON THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS AND THE MARGINS WERE COVERED WITH HIS NOTES WHICH SOMETIMES CONTRADICTED MY THEORIES AND FORMULATIONS
FIRST NED LAND CLOSED AND BOLTED THE OPENING CUT INTO THE NAUTILUS'S SHEET IRON USING THE MONKEY WRENCH HE HAD WITH HIM
CAPTAIN NEMO TOOK OUT THE INGOTS ONE BY ONE AND ARRANGED THEM METHODICALLY INSIDE THE CHEST FILLING IT TO THE TOP
AS VALUABLE AS THE ARTOCARPUS THESE TREES ARE JUSTLY RANKED AMONG THE MOST USEFUL PRODUCE IN MALAYSIA
DREADFUL ANIMALS THAT TEEM IN THESE SEAS AND MAKE THEM EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
AND THESE VALUABLE ANIMALS AS OBLIVIOUS AS IF THEY WERE DEAF AND BLIND LEAP RIGHT INTO THE MARSEILLES TUNA NETS AND PERISH BY THE THOUSANDS
THE MECHANISM WAS LOADED WITH WATER AND THE FULL ELECTRIC HEAT OF OUR BATTERIES WAS THROWN INTO COILS AWASH IN LIQUID
OFF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS ON JUNE 30 THE FRIGATE CAME IN CONTACT WITH A FLEET OF AMERICAN WHALERS AND WE LEARNED THAT THEY HADN'T SEEN THE NARWHALE
THEY WERE SPURRING EACH OTHER ON
AN UNDERWATER FOREST 86 18
THE ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL WATER WAS ENOUGH TO SHIFT ITS BALANCE
IT WOULD HAVE SOUNDED JUST FINE DURING SOME MISSISSIPPI PADDLE-WHEELER RACE TO OUTSTRIP THE COMPETITION CONSEIL I SAID TO MY GALLANT SERVANT NOW AT MY SIDE YOU REALIZE THAT WE'LL PROBABLY BLOW OURSELVES SKYHIGH AS MASTER WISHES CONSEIL REPLIED
AND IN ALL HONESTY I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS GOD NEVER INTENDED FOR HUMAN EYES NED WAS RIGHT
TO ANYONE WITHOUT MY GRAND PASSION FOR THE SEA THESE HOURS WOULD SURELY HAVE SEEMED LONG AND MONOTONOUS
THESE ANIMALS KNOW BY INSTINCT HOW TO GOUGE HOLES IN THE ICE FIELDS AND KEEP THEM CONTINUALLY OPEN
NOW PROFESSOR HE SAID IF YOU'D LIKE TO INSPECT THE NAUTILUS I'M YOURS TO COMMAND CHAPTER 11 THE NAUTILUS CAPTAIN NEMO STOOD UP
I SHARED WITH HIM THE RELEVANT DETAILS ON THE GULF STREAM
CONSEIL USED THE METHODS OF OUR MENTOR PROFESSOR MILNE-EDWARDS WHO PUTS THE DECAPODS IN THREE DIVISIONS
TEN OR TWELVE DEVILFISH HAD OVERRUN THE NAUTILUS'S PLATFORM AND SIDES
THIS ORDER CONTAINS FOUR FAMILIES
WE'RE SINKING
SO I CAUGHT A LARGE NUMBER OF FISH IN THE VICINITY OF SUEZ
ATLANTIS THAT ANCIENT LAND OF MEROPIS MENTIONED BY THE HISTORIAN THEOPOMPUS
THE NAUTILUS WAS FLEEING NORTHWARD AT A SPEED OF TWENTY-FIVE MILES PER HOUR SOMETIMES ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA SOMETIMES THIRTY FEET BENEATH IT
WE HAD BEEN LEFT TO OURSELVES FOR TWENTY MINUTES TRYING TO DETECT THE TINIEST NOISES INSIDE THE NAUTILUS WHEN CAPTAIN NEMO ENTERED
THERE THE DUST THAT SATURATES THE AIR GIVES SUCH RAYS THE APPEARANCE OF A LUMINOUS FOG
IT SERVED AS BOTH NEST AND NOURISHMENT FOR MYRIADS OF CRUSTACEANS AND MOLLUSKS FOR CRABS AND CUTTLEFISH
I COULD HEAR THE BALLAST TANKS FILLING LITTLE BY LITTLE AND THE NAUTILUS SANK GENTLY BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
THAT'S CALLED A MILK SEA I TOLD HIM A VAST EXPANSE OF WHITE WAVES OFTEN SEEN ALONG THE COASTS OF AMBOINA AND IN THESE WATERWAYS BUT CONSEIL ASKED COULD MASTER TELL ME THE CAUSE OF THIS EFFECT BECAUSE I PRESUME THIS WATER HASN'T REALLY CHANGED INTO MILK NO MY BOY AND THIS WHITENESS THAT AMAZES YOU IS MERELY DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF MYRIADS OF TINY CREATURES CALLED INFUSORIA A SORT OF DIMINUTIVE GLOWWORM THAT'S COLORLESS AND GELATINOUS IN APPEARANCE AS THICK AS A STRAND OF HAIR AND NO LONGER THAN ONE-FIFTH OF A MILLIMETER
IT DROPPED STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE SEA AND SURF FOAMED AGAINST IT
SEIZED BY THE TENTACLE AND GLUED TO ITS SUCKERS THE UNFORTUNATE MAN WAS SWINGING IN THE AIR AT THE MERCY OF THIS ENORMOUS APPENDAGE
KING NECHO II WAS HARD AT WORK ON A CANAL THAT WAS FED BY NILE WATER AND RAN THROUGH THE EGYPTIAN PLAINS OPPOSITE ARABIA
ANOTHER DAY
THERE THE MOUNTAIN ROSE ONLY 700 TO 800 FEET ABOVE THE PLAINS
AS THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER HAD PREDICTED MY MIND WAS ALREADY STARTING TO FALL INTO THAT PROMISED STATE OF STUNNED AMAZEMENT
AND NOW EVEN THOUGH HIS IDENTITY WAS STILL UNKNOWN AT LEAST THE NATIONS ALLIED AGAINST HIM KNEW THEY WERE NO LONGER HUNTING SOME FAIRY-TALE MONSTER BUT A MAN WHO HAD SWORN AN IMPLACABLE HATE TOWARD THEM
WHAT ARE A FEW HOURS MORE OR LESS SO LONG AS WE GET OUT YES NED LAND REPEATED SO LONG AS WE GET OUT I STROLLED FOR A LITTLE WHILE FROM THE LOUNGE INTO THE LIBRARY
THESE VARIOUS EXHIBITS FROM THE SEA WERE IMMEDIATELY LOWERED DOWN THE HATCH IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STORAGE LOCKERS SOME TO BE EATEN FRESH OTHERS TO BE PRESERVED
AND I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT THE CANADIAN SHOT BACK
OUR POSITION FIX PLACED US IN LATITUDE 45 DEGREES 37 SOUTH AND LONGITUDE 37 DEGREES 53 WEST
LUCKILY NEAR TWO O'CLOCK NED LAND BROUGHT DOWN A MAGNIFICENT WILD PIG OF THE TYPE THE NATIVES CALL BARI-OUTANG THIS ANIMAL CAME IN THE NICK OF TIME FOR US TO BAG SOME REAL QUADRUPED MEAT AND IT WAS WARMLY WELCOMED
THE SAME PHRASE WAS PRONOUNCED BY THE SAME INDIVIDUAL
WHEN IT OVERTURNED THAT ICEBERG CLOSED OFF EVERY EXIT WE'RE BOXED IN YES CHAPTER 16 SHORTAGE OF AIR CONSEQUENTLY ABOVE BELOW AND AROUND THE NAUTILUS THERE WERE IMPENETRABLE FROZEN WALLS
YES YES AND CONSEIL HURLED ANOTHER DESPERATE PLEA INTO SPACE
WHAT PEN COULD DESCRIBE IT
YOU STILL AREN'T OVER YOUR OLD FISHING URGES HOW COULD A WHALE FISHERMAN FORGET HIS OLD TRADE SIR
A BIRD'S BEAK ON A MOLLUSK
I ONLY NEED TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES TO SERVE YOU ONE OF MY OWN SPECIAL CREATIONS BY 8:30 THE NAUTILUS'S SKIFF HAD JUST RUN GENTLY AGROUND ON A SANDY STRAND AFTER SUCCESSFULLY CLEARING THE RING OF CORAL THAT SURROUNDS GUEBOROA ISLAND
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THEN POPPED INTO MY HEAD
WE'RE GOING TO ESCAPE I SAT UP
I ACCEPT YOUR KIND WISHES AND I THANK YOU FOR THEM
AFTER TOMORROW HE SAID THE AIR TANKS WILL BE EMPTY I BROKE OUT IN A COLD SWEAT
PERHAPS THEY HADN'T SEEN US GO OVERBOARD
YOU AND YOUR COMPANIONS GO BELOW SIR I EXCLAIMED ARE YOU GOING TO ATTACK THIS SHIP SIR I'M GOING TO SINK IT YOU WOULDN'T I WILL CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED ICILY
HE AVOIDED EVEN DEALING WITH THE SUBJECT FOR WHICH ONE DAY I FELT COMPELLED TO TAKE HIM TO TASK
ITS MASTING WAS VISIBLE FOR AN INSTANT BUT IT COULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE NAUTILUS BECAUSE WE WERE LYING TOO LOW IN THE WATER
IN NEW YORK PREPARATIONS WERE UNDER WAY FOR AN EXPEDITION DESIGNED TO CHASE THIS NARWHALE
SIR HE TOLD ME I'LL DIE IF I DON'T SAMPLE A LITTLE BREADFRUIT PASTA SAMPLE SOME NED MY FRIEND SAMPLE ALL YOU LIKE
THE SAME INADEQUATE LIGHT THE SAME SOLITUDE
BUT THE SUBJECT IT PORTRAYS IS TAKEN FROM A LEGEND AND YOU KNOW HOW TO RATE LEGENDS IN MATTERS OF NATURAL HISTORY
IN THE SKY TOWARD THE SOUTHERN HORIZON THERE STRETCHED A DAZZLING WHITE BAND
WHAT RAGE THEN DROVE US AGAINST THESE MONSTERS
I REPEAT
I REPEAT
I REPEAT
A COMMON HAMMER SHELL FROM THE SEAS NEAR QUEENSLAND VERY HARD TO COME BY
THIS ABILITY AS I LATER VERIFIED--WAS STRENGTHENED BY A RANGE OF VISION EVEN GREATER THAN NED LAND'S
HEADACHES AND STAGGERING FITS OF DIZZINESS MADE ME REEL LIKE A DRUNK
SPERM WHALES AND BALEEN WHALES 220 13
I GAVE A YELL OF DESPAIR
FROM JANUARY 21 TO THE 23RD THE NAUTILUS TRAVELED AT THE RATE OF 250 LEAGUES IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS HENCE 540 MILES AT TWENTY-TWO MILES PER HOUR
I HAVE NO IDEA BUT USUALLY HE STAYED IN MIDWATER AND WELL OUT FROM ANY COAST
ACCORDINGLY THIS EXCELLENT ANIMAL HAS BEEN HUNTED SO BLOODTHIRSTILY THAT LIKE ITS MANATEE RELATIVES IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE SCARCE IN THAT CASE CAPTAIN CONSEIL SAID IN ALL SERIOUSNESS ON THE OFFCHANCE THAT THIS CREATURE MIGHT BE THE LAST OF ITS LINE WOULDN'T IT BE ADVISABLE TO SPARE ITS LIFE IN THE INTERESTS OF SCIENCE MAYBE THE CANADIAN ANSWERED IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HUNT IT DOWN IN THE INTERESTS OF MEALTIME THEN PROCEED MR LAND CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED
YOU'VE CAUGHT A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE FASCINATING ANIMALS
THE SURFACE OF THIS LONG SHEET-IRON CIGAR NO LONGER OFFERED A SINGLE PROTRUSION THAT COULD HAMPER ITS MANEUVERS
NOW THEN I USE GLASS WINDOWS MEASURING NO LESS THAN TWENTY-ONE CENTIMETERS AT THEIR CENTERS
LIKE ME THEY WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE NIGHT AND TO UNRAVEL THIS MYSTERY I COULD COUNT ONLY ON SOME FUTURE HAPPENSTANCE
SPURRED GILTHEAD STOLE BY WITH THEIR SWIFT THORACIC FINS
AFTER SEEING THESE NED LAND EXHIBITED AN OBVIOUS DISTASTE FOR THE IDEA OF PUTTING ONE ON
CAN'T YOU TELL ME HOW MANY MEN ARE ON BOARD
AND WHAT ARE 300 METERS TO THE NAUTILUS A MERE NOTHING SIR WE COULD EVEN GO TO GREATER DEPTHS AND FIND THAT TEMPERATURE LAYER COMMON TO ALL OCEAN WATER AND THERE WE'D BRAVE WITH IMPUNITY THE 30 DEGREES OR 40 DEGREES COLD ON THE SURFACE TRUE SIR VERY TRUE I REPLIED WITH GROWING EXCITEMENT
THIS MAN EXPRESSED HIMSELF WITH PERFECT EASE AND WITHOUT A TRACE OF AN ACCENT
BY MAY 15 WE WERE OFF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE GRAND BANKS OF NEWFOUNDLAND
THE NAUTILUS RESUMED ITS UNDERWATER NAVIGATING
I IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE WONDROUS REGION IN WHICH CAPTAIN NEMO DID THE HONORS THAT DAY
THEY COULD BE HEARD CHATTING DISCUSSING ARGUING CALCULATING THE DIFFERENT CHANCES OF AN ENCOUNTER AND OBSERVING THE VAST EXPANSE OF THE OCEAN
ONE LAST QUESTION I SAID JUST AS THIS INEXPLICABLE BEING SEEMED READY TO WITHDRAW
DO YOU THINK I TOIL TO GATHER THIS TREASURE OUT OF SELFISHNESS
OH SIR A HIVE A HIVE I ANSWERED WITH A GESTURE OF UTTER DISBELIEF
CAPTAIN NEMO COMMANDER OF THE NAUTILUS
THEIR WOOLLY RED-TINTED HAIR WAS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THEIR BODIES WHICH WERE BLACK AND GLISTENING LIKE THOSE OF NUBIANS
HE LOOKED GLOOMIER THAN EVER
PERFECTLY FREE
ALTHOUGH THE SUMMER SUN LAVISHED ITS RAYS ON US WE NEVER SUFFERED FROM THE HEAT BECAUSE THIRTY OR FORTY METERS UNDERWATER THE TEMPERATURE DIDN'T GO OVER 10 DEGREES TO 12 DEGREES CENTIGRADE
THE FOLLOWING DAY JANUARY 10 THE NAUTILUS RESUMED ITS TRAVELS IN MIDWATER BUT AT A REMARKABLE SPEED THAT I ESTIMATED TO BE AT LEAST THIRTY-FIVE MILES PER HOUR
CAPTAIN NEMO GAVE US A HAND SIGNAL
PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE REPLIED DO YOU DARE CLAIM THAT YOUR FRIGATE WOULDN'T HAVE CHASED AND CANNONADED AN UNDERWATER BOAT AS READILY AS A MONSTER THIS QUESTION BAFFLED ME SINCE COMMANDER FARRAGUT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SHOWN NO SUCH HESITATION
WELL MR LAND HE SAID
THE COXSWAIN PRONOUNCED A FEW WORDS IN HIS BIZARRE LANGUAGE AND NO DOUBT HE ALERTED HIS MEN TO KEEP ON THEIR GUARD
I COULD FEEL US WHIRLING
TO CONVEY SUCH SIGHTS IT WOULD TAKE THE PEN OF OUR MOST FAMOUS POET VICTOR HUGO AUTHOR OF THE TOILERS OF THE SEA
IT REACHED A DEPTH OF 800 METERS
GOD IF HE BELIEVED IN HIM HIS CONSCIENCE IF HE HAD ONE THESE WERE THE ONLY JUDGES TO WHOM HE WAS ANSWERABLE
WELL HELMSMAN COMMANDER FARRAGUT ASKED
WHAT A CHASE
AND NOW I KNEW WHERE CAPTAIN NEMO HAD DELIVERED THOSE MILLIONS WHEN THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED THE WATERS WHERE CRETE WAS IN REBELLION AGAINST THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
WHAT HAVE YOU TO TELL US WHAT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU IS VERY SIMPLE THE CANADIAN REPLIED
AS FOR ME I WASN'T EXACTLY GRIEF-STRICKEN
NEVERTHELESS IT ISN'T MATHEMATICALLY EXACT PROOF BECAUSE THE EQUINOX NEEDN'T FALL PRECISELY AT NOON NO DOUBT SIR BUT THE ERROR WILL BE UNDER 100 METERS AND THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH FOR US
THE TIME COULDN'T BE FAR AWAY WHEN THE NAUTILUS WOULD ATTACK ITS ADVERSARY AND MY COMPANIONS AND I WOULD LEAVE FOREVER THIS MAN I DARED NOT JUDGE
HERE WE ARE PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO THEN SAID
I LET THE GALLANT LAD BABBLE AS HE PLEASED WITHOUT GIVING HIM MUCH IN THE WAY OF A REPLY
BUT ELSEWHERE
SEATED ON THE AFTERDECK NED LAND AND I CHATTED ABOUT ONE THING AND ANOTHER STARING AT THAT MYSTERIOUS SEA WHOSE DEPTHS TO THIS DAY ARE BEYOND THE REACH OF HUMAN EYES
TO BE SURE I HAD CONFIDENCE IN THIS DEVOTED LAD
WELL SIR HE SAID TO ME
PERHAPS A STORM HAD BEEN UNLEASHED ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
I WENT INTO THE LOUNGE
THOSE NOT SLIPPING THROUGH THE SIEVES PIERCED WITH 100 TO 800 HOLES ARE IN THE SECOND ORDER
MY FACE WAS PURPLE MY LIPS BLUE MY FACULTIES IN ABEYANCE
AS IN THE 1860 CYCLONE ON RéUNION ISLAND THE BAROMETER FELL TO 710 MILLIMETERS
SINCE CAPTAIN NEMO HADN'T YET APPEARED ONLY CONSEIL AND I WERE TAKEN ASHORE BY THE SKIFF
THEIR VISION WEAKENS ULCERS BREAK OUT ON THEIR EYES SORES FORM ON THEIR BODIES AND SOME ARE EVEN STRICKEN WITH APOPLEXY ON THE OCEAN FLOOR YES I SAID IT'S A SAD OCCUPATION AND ONE THAT EXISTS ONLY TO GRATIFY THE WHIMS OF FASHION
THE TERRAIN CONSISTED MOSTLY OF THICK SLIME MIXED WITH PETRIFIED BRANCHES BUT IT CHANGED LITTLE BY LITTLE NEAR FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
THE WONDERFUL SOUTHERN CROSS POLAR STAR OF THE ANTARCTIC REGIONS TWINKLED AT ITS ZENITH
THAT FINE ANIMAL MAY EVEN LET ITSELF BE CAPTURED IN EUROPEAN SEAS--AS A PERSONAL FAVOR TO ME--AND I'LL BRING BACK TO THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY AT LEAST HALF A METER OF ITS IVORY LANCE BUT IN THE MEANTIME I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK FOR THIS NARWHALE IN THE NORTHERN PACIFIC OCEAN
WHAT A NIGHT
BUT THIS HARDLY MATTERED SO LONG AS THE LOWER SURFACE KEPT GROWING THINNER
DOESN'T IT EXPERIENCE BOTH ANGER AND AFFECTION
SHARK ATTACKS GIANT SQUID CANNIBALS HURRICANES WHALE HUNTS AND OTHER RIP-ROARING ADVENTURES ERUPT ALMOST AT RANDOM
SOME WERE FOUR METERS LONG
THE NAUTILUS DREW NEAR THIS ISLAND WHICH I CAN SEE TO THIS DAY WITH ITS REMARKABLE FRINGE OF SCREW PINES
OUR SOLE CHANCE FOR SALVATION IS TO WORK FASTER THAN THE WATER SOLIDIFIES
THE TALLER OF THE TWO--APPARENTLY THE LEADER ON BOARD--EXAMINED US WITH THE GREATEST CARE BUT WITHOUT PRONOUNCING A WORD
UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS SUCH READINGS ARE OBTAINED USING SOME PRETTY COMPLICATED INSTRUMENTS WHOSE FINDINGS ARE DUBIOUS TO SAY THE LEAST WHETHER THEY'RE THERMOMETRIC SOUNDING LINES WHOSE GLASS OFTEN SHATTERS UNDER THE WATER'S PRESSURE OR THOSE DEVICES BASED ON THE VARYING RESISTANCE OF METALS TO ELECTRIC CURRENTS
I WENT BACK TO READING SIRR'S BOOK BUT I LEAFED THROUGH IT MECHANICALLY
FOR ONE INSTANT I COULD SEE THEIR LOFTY PEAKS
THIS IS OUR HOME PORT SECURE CONVENIENT SECRET AND SHELTERED AGAINST WINDS FROM ANY DIRECTION
THE SICK MAN'S BREATHING WAS LABORED AND MUSCLE SPASMS QUIVERED IN HIS FACE
SAGO PASTA BREAD FROM THE ARTOCARPUS MANGOES HALF A DOZEN PINEAPPLES AND THE FERMENTED LIQUOR FROM CERTAIN COCONUTS HEIGHTENED OUR GLEE
IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE MY STATEROOM AND REJOIN MY COMPANIONS
WE COULD BARELY COPE WITH THIS DIZZYING RUSH AND THE WAVES BATTERED US AT CLOSE RANGE
COME ALONG NED I LED THE CANADIAN TO THE ROOM WHERE THE NAUTILUS'S MEN WERE PUTTING ON THEIR DIVING SUITS
YES THE CAPTAIN REPLIED COOLLY THE ANTARCTIC POLE THAT UNKNOWN SPOT CROSSED BY EVERY MERIDIAN ON THE GLOBE
IT'S SUPERB
THE CEILING LIGHTS IN THE LOUNGE THEN WENT OUT THE PANELS OPENED AND THROUGH THE WINDOWS I SAW FOR A HALF-MILE RADIUS THE SEA BRIGHTLY LIT BY THE BEACON'S RAYS
BUT EVEN SO WAS THE MAN GOING TO LET US DIE OF STARVATION LOCKED UP IN THIS CRAMPED PRISON EXPOSED TO THOSE HORRIBLE TEMPTATIONS TO WHICH PEOPLE ARE DRIVEN BY EXTREME HUNGER
NED I ASKED HIM HOW CAN YOU STILL DOUBT THE REALITY OF THIS CETACEAN WE'RE AFTER
GOOD NED PUT IN
IT HAD UNDOUBTEDLY SUNK INTO THE WATERY DEEP AND NO LONGER BELONGED TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD
CAPTAIN NEMO STARED AT ME
BUT NOTHING BINDS US TO CAPTAIN NEMO
CAPTAIN NEMO HEADED TOWARD THE PEAK WHICH HE NO DOUBT PLANNED TO MAKE HIS OBSERVATORY
I'VE EVEN MANAGED TO STOW SOME PROVISIONS INSIDE
ITS NAVIGATING WAS MARKED BY AN ENCOUNTER WITH AN IMMENSE SCHOOL OF SQUID UNUSUAL MOLLUSKS THAT ARE NEAR NEIGHBORS OF THE CUTTLEFISH
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO NOTICE MY PRESENCE AND BEGAN A SERIES OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS
MEANWHILE CRAZED WITH TERROR THE UNHINGED PAPUANS BEAT A RETREAT
DID HE HIMSELF NEVER LEAVE THE NAUTILUS
AROUND THE NAUTILUS FOR A HALF-MILE RADIUS THE WATERS SEEMED SATURATED WITH ELECTRIC LIGHT
FINALLY AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON LADEN WITH ALL OUR TREASURES WE LEFT THE ISLAND BEACH AND HALF AN HOUR LATER PULLED ALONGSIDE THE NAUTILUS
NOW SOME TWENTY DUGOUT CANOES WERE SURROUNDING THE NAUTILUS
BUT THIS DIDN'T ALARM ME AND I JUST LET IT SLEEP OFF ITS NUTMEG
IT WAS UNLIKELY BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER HIS WORK WOULD PERISH WITH HIM IN SOME UNKNOWN SEA
SOON THE NATURE OF THE SEAFLOOR CHANGED
WHILE THESE FASCINATING ANIMALS WERE COOKING NED PREPARED SOME BREAD FROM THE ARTOCARPUS
ED
ED
BOXFISH ARMED WITH STINGS FORMED BY EXTENSIONS OF THEIR BONY CRUSTS AND WHOSE ODD GRUNTING HAS EARNED THEM THE NICKNAME SEA PIGS
LITTLE BY LITTLE I HEARD THOSE AFORESAID CUSSWORDS WELLING UP IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS GULLET AND I SAW HIS MOVEMENTS TURN THREATENING AGAIN
ON FEBRUARY 2 AT 78 DEGREES 4
CONSEIL BROUGHT A DOZEN OF THEM TO NED LAND WHO CUT THEM INTO THICK SLICES AND PLACED THEM OVER A FIRE OF LIVE COALS ALL THE WHILE REPEATING
IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO SPEAK AND FOR ME TO HEAR THAT OLD RABELAISIAN DIALECT STILL USED IN SOME CANADIAN PROVINCES
BUT I HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO LOOK FOR THEM AND I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT OFF ANY LONGER OUR STROLL THROUGH THE WONDERS OF THE NAUTILUS
WHO COULD TEAR HIM FROM SUCH A POWERFUL GRIP
THE SKIFF WAS AGROUND IN ITS USUAL PLACE
158 PICTURESQUE RUINS TOOK SHAPE
NOW THEN THIS HOLE DIDN'T MAKE ITSELF AND SINCE IT HADN'T RESULTED FROM UNDERWATER ROCKS OR UNDERWATER MACHINES IT MUST HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE PERFORATING TOOL OF SOME ANIMAL
I COULD NO LONGER SEE OR HEAR
CONSEIL WAS NOT MISTAKEN
A HOWL OF FURY BURST FROM EVERY THROAT
SO I WAS STILL MISSING VARIETY SPECIES GENUS AND FAMILY BUT NO DOUBT I WOULD COMPLETE MY CLASSIFYING WITH THE AID OF HEAVEN AND COMMANDER FARRAGUT
MY VIEWS WERE IN DEMAND
THE NAUTILUS'S BOW AND STERN BOASTED THAT SPINDLE-SHAPED OUTLINE THAT HAD CAUSED THE SHIP TO BE COMPARED APPROPRIATELY TO A LONG CIGAR
THIS MAGNIFICENT RADIANCE HAD TO COME FROM SOME FORCE WITH A GREAT ILLUMINATING CAPACITY
BLACK-TINTED RUDDERFISH THAT YOU CATCH BY USING TORCHES FISH MEASURING TWO METERS AND BOASTING WHITE FIRM PLUMP MEAT THAT WHEN FRESH TASTES LIKE EEL WHEN DRIED LIKE SMOKED SALMON
NO MAN AMONG MEN COULD CALL HIM TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS ACTIONS
WITH THE THRUST OF ITS PROPELLER CURBED BY THE SLANT OF ITS FINS THE NAUTILUS STOOD STILL
BUT THEIR LOWER JAWS LACK CANINES AND INCISORS AND AS FOR THEIR UPPER CANINES THEY CONSIST OF TWO TUSKS EIGHTY CENTIMETERS LONG WITH A CIRCUMFERENCE OF THIRTY-THREE CENTIMETERS AT THE SOCKET
I RESUMED MY WORK HOPING HE MIGHT GIVE ME SOME EXPLANATION OF THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON'S EVENTS
BUT AT 12:53 IN THE MORNING A DEAFENING HISS BECAME AUDIBLE RESEMBLING THE SOUND MADE BY A WATERSPOUT EXPELLED WITH TREMENDOUS INTENSITY
IT GENERATES ELECTRICITY AND ELECTRICITY GIVES THE NAUTILUS HEAT LIGHT MOTION AND IN A WORD LIFE ITSELF BUT NOT THE AIR YOU BREATHE OH I COULD PRODUCE THE AIR NEEDED ON BOARD BUT IT WOULD BE POINTLESS SINCE I CAN RISE TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA WHENEVER I LIKE
I WAS IN THESE SEAS WHEN THAT PHENOMENON OCCURRED AND I WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE ITS EVERY PHASE
CONSEIL HAD TO KEEP ME GOING AND ATTENDING TO OUR SELF-PRESERVATION BECAME HIS SOLE RESPONSIBILITY
WERE WE LYING IN THE DANGEROUS WATERWAYS OFF THE NORWEGIAN COAST
EST IN CARPATHIO NEPTUNI GURGITE VATES CAERULEUS PROTEUS LATIN
DAMNATION
DAMNATION
DAMNATION
I HOISTED MYSELF UP TO THE CROSSTREES OF THE MIZZEN SAIL
IN THE MIDST OF THESE FLAMES THAT DIDN'T BURN I COULD SEE SWIFT ELEGANT PORPOISES THE TIRELESS PRANKSTERS OF THE SEAS AND SAILFISH THREE METERS LONG THOSE SHREWD HERALDS OF HURRICANES WHOSE FEARSOME BROADSWORDS SOMETIMES BANGED AGAINST THE LOUNGE WINDOW
FROM THIS POINT ON IT WAS AN ISSUE OF CUTTING OUT A PIECE EQUAL IN SURFACE AREA TO THE NAUTILUS'S WATERLINE
PICTURE A FOREST CLINGING TO THE SIDES OF A PEAK IN THE HARZ MOUNTAINS BUT A SUBMERGED FOREST
IT WAS A FINE CATCH BUT NOT SURPRISING
FIVE DAYS PASSED IN THIS WAY WITH NO CHANGE IN OUR SITUATION
NOW WE HAVE ONLY ASPHYXIATION TO FEAR DURING THE NIGHT THE WATER TEMPERATURE ROSE TO 1 DEGREES CENTIGRADE
THIS STRUCK ME AS A PRETTY NEEDLESS QUESTION TO SAY THE LEAST
ON THE OTHER THOSE FAVORING AN UNDERWATER BOAT OF TREMENDOUS MOTOR POWER
WHAT CAN THAT ANIMAL BE
THEY HAD NO ROOTS AND DIDN'T CARE WHICH SOLID OBJECTS SECURED THEM SAND SHELLS HUSKS OR PEBBLES
MAY I LEARN SIR I ASKED HIM WHAT CAUSED THIS ACCIDENT AN ENORMOUS BLOCK OF ICE AN ENTIRE MOUNTAIN HAS TOPPLED OVER HE ANSWERED ME
INSIDE THE NAUTILUS ALL WAS GLOOM AND SILENCE
THESE FURNISHINGS FOLLOWED THE CONTOURS OF THE ROOM THEIR LOWER PARTS LEADING TO HUGE COUCHES UPHOLSTERED IN MAROON LEATHER AND CURVED FOR MAXIMUM COMFORT
WE MASSAGED HIS CONTRACTED ARMS AND WHEN HE REGAINED HIS FIVE SENSES THAT ETERNAL CLASSIFIER MUMBLED IN A BROKEN VOICE
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE SAID TO ME
OPEN YOUR EYES
WHERE ARE WE UNDERGROUND PROFESSOR UNDERGROUND I EXCLAIMED
NEVERTHELESS WHEN I SCALED A HIGH ESCARPMENT I COULD SEE NO VOLCANOES WITHIN A RADIUS OF SEVERAL MILES
THE MONTH OF MARCH SINCE IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF OCTOBER IN THESE LATITUDES WAS GIVING US SOME FINE AUTUMN DAYS
THROUGH THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE I SPOTTED ROCKY BOTTOMS BRIGHTLY LIT BY OUR ELECTRIC RAYS
BY JULY 3 WE WERE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN ABREAST OF CABO DE LAS VIRGENES
UNLIKELY CHOICES FOR A MAN WHO AVOIDED POPULATED AREAS
WITH NED AND CONSEIL I WENT TO SIT ON THE PLATFORM
HE GAVE ME AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE BOW IN RETURN WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ME
COCKLES WHOSE SHELLS HAVE RIBLIKE RIDGES ON THEIR ARCHING SUMMITS TRITON SHELLS POCKED WITH SCARLET BUMPS CARNIAIRA SNAILS WITH BACKWARD-CURVING TIPS THAT MAKE THEM RESEMBLE FLIMSY GONDOLAS CROWNED FEROLA SNAILS ATLANTA SNAILS WITH SPIRAL SHELLS GRAY NUDIBRANCHS FROM THE GENUS TETHYS THAT WERE SPOTTED WITH WHITE AND COVERED BY FRINGED MANTLES NUDIBRANCHS FROM THE SUBORDER EOLIDEA THAT LOOKED LIKE SMALL SLUGS SEA BUTTERFLIES CRAWLING ON THEIR BACKS SEASHELLS FROM THE GENUS AURICULA INCLUDING THE OVAL-SHAPED AURICULA MYOSOTIS TAN WENTLETRAP SNAILS COMMON PERIWINKLES VIOLET SNAILS CINERAIRA SNAILS ROCK BORERS EAR SHELLS CABOCHON SNAILS PANDORA SHELLS ETC
BUT JUST THEN LIFTED OFF BY THE TIDE'S FINAL UNDULATIONS THE NAUTILUS LEFT ITS CORAL BED AT EXACTLY THAT FORTIETH MINUTE PINPOINTED BY THE CAPTAIN
I OPENED IT AND WENT BELOW TO THE LOUNGE
ALL THE TRANQUIL GLIMMERS OF THE ICE WALLS HAD THEN CHANGED INTO BLAZING STREAKS
BUT THESE FISHERMEN GENERALLY DON'T LIVE TO ADVANCED AGE
WHERE MASTER GOES I GO CONSEIL REPLIED
NOBODY IN THE LIBRARY
THEN SOME TRUNKFISH KNOWN AS DROMEDARIES WITH TOUGH LEATHERY FLESH AND BIG CONICAL HUMPS
WHEN THE NAUTILUS WAS READY TO RESUME ITS UNDERWATER TRAVELS I WENT BELOW AGAIN TO THE LOUNGE
THEIR CLUSTERS OF FLOWERS DROOPED SADLY THEIR COLORS AND SCENTS WERE FADED
84 THE DUGOUT CANOES DREW NEARER
AFTER HALF AN HOUR OF WALKING THE SEAFLOOR GREW ROCKY
CAPTAIN I SAID TO HIM
THAT DAY I PRESSED HIM NO FURTHER
IF CAPTAIN NEMO DOES SOMETIMES GO ASHORE I TOLD THEM AT LEAST HE ONLY PICKS DESERT ISLANDS NED LAND SHOOK HIS HEAD WITHOUT REPLYING
BY WHICH I MEAN THIS OCEAN WHERE HIS WEALTH IS SAFER THAN IN ANY NATIONAL TREASURY I THEN RELATED THE EVENING'S INCIDENTS TO THE CANADIAN SECRETLY HOPING HE WOULD COME AROUND TO THE IDEA OF NOT DESERTING THE CAPTAIN
ON THE 27TH HE LAY AT 76 DEGREES 8
ITS ARMS STRETCHED A DISTANCE TWICE THE LENGTH OF ITS BODY AND WERE WRITHING LIKE THE SERPENTINE HAIR OF THE FURIES
BUT NEXT TO THE PROFESSOR'S WHALE MINE WAS JUST A BABY DO THESE ANIMALS LIVE A LONG TIME CONSEIL ASKED
SOFT TO THE FOOT THESE DENSELY TEXTURED LAWNS WOULD HAVE RIVALED THE MOST LUXURIANT CARPETS WOVEN BY THE HAND OF MAN
THEN JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO STRIKE THE CETACEAN WOULD STEAL OFF WITH A SWIFTNESS I COULD ESTIMATE AT NO LESS THAN THIRTY MILES PER HOUR
I COULDN'T SAY YET
I METICULOUSLY NOTED THESE DIFFERENT DEPTHS OBTAINING THE UNDERWATER PROFILE OF THIS UPSIDE-DOWN MOUNTAIN CHAIN THAT STRETCHED BENEATH THE SEA
HIS INSTRUMENTS WERE BESIDE HIM
BUT I WAS NEVER IN A POSITION TO VERIFY THIS BECAUSE AROUND ME HE USED ONLY AN ODD AND UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE DIALECT
NO THE CANADIAN REPLIED UNLESS I'M BADLY MISTAKEN THAT'S SOME MARINE ANIMAL ARE THERE WHALES IN THE RED SEA CONSEIL ASKED
SLANTING INWARD OVER THEIR BASE THESE HIGH WALLS CONVERGED TO FORM A VAULT SHAPED LIKE AN IMMENSE UPSIDE-DOWN FUNNEL THAT MEASURED 500 OR 600 METERS IN HEIGHT
SO I SPENT THE DAY PUTTING MY NOTES INTO FINAL FORM
AND YOU NED WHO HAVE SUCH GOOD EYES I ADDED YOU CAN SPOT THE JETTIES OF PORT SAID STRETCHING OUT TO SEA THE CANADIAN LOOKED CAREFULLY
BRIGHTLY LIT THE ENGINE ROOM MEASURED AT LEAST 20 METERS IN LENGTH
IN REALITY SUCH A COLUMN OF WATER WOULDN'T BE QUITE SO HIGH BECAUSE HERE WE'RE DEALING WITH SALT WATER WHICH IS DENSER THAN FRESH WATER
CAPTAIN BAKER AT FIRST THOUGHT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN REEF
SO WHAT WERE THESE VAST PLAINS WE WERE NOW CROSSING
ORDER PASSERIFORMA DIVISION CLYSTOMORA CONSEIL REPLIED
MY MIND WAS REELING AS NEVER BEFORE
WHALING GEAR WAS SET UP ALONG THE RAILINGS
WHERE'S THE ROAST RIGHT I SAID
AT FIRST DISCOURAGEMENT TOOK HOLD OF PEOPLE'S MINDS OPENING THE DOOR TO DISBELIEF
I NOTED SEVERAL SPECIES I HADN'T PREVIOUSLY BEEN ABLE TO OBSERVE
PROOF POSITIVE THAT THOSE CLOUDS KEPT AT A MODERATE ALTITUDE BECAUSE THIS VOLCANO DIDN'T RISE MORE THAN 1,800 FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE OCEAN
THEN EXPLOSIONS CAVE-INS AND GREAT ICEBERG SOMERSAULTS WOULD OCCUR ALL AROUND US ALTERING THE SCENERY LIKE THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE IN A DIORAMA
IN TRUTH THERE WERE TOO MANY SEALS ASHORE AND IT WOULD NEVER DO TO EXPOSE THIS IMPULSIVE FISHERMAN TO SUCH TEMPTATIONS
AS FOR CAPTAIN NEMO HE WAS NO LONGER IN THE PICTURE
IF THERE WERE ITS UNDERGROUND CURRENT HAD TO GO FROM THE RED SEA TO THE MEDITERRANEAN SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFERENCE IN LEVEL
HERE THE RANGE OF UNDERWATER FLORA SEEMED PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE TO ME AS WELL AS MORE ABUNDANT THAN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE ARCTIC OR TROPICAL ZONES WHERE SUCH EXHIBITS ARE LESS COMMON
MY FRIENDS I SAID WE'RE IN A SERIOUS PREDICAMENT BUT I'M COUNTING ON YOUR COURAGE AND ENERGY SIR THE CANADIAN REPLIED THIS IS NO TIME TO BORE YOU WITH MY COMPLAINTS
THE CAPTAIN WAS THERE
IT WAS FOR HIM FOR HIM ALONE THAT AMERICA HAD YIELDED UP ITS PRECIOUS METALS
CAPTAIN NEMO REMAINED INVISIBLE
OR RATHER AND THIS THOUGHT DID CROSS MY MIND HAD THE HAND OF MAN INTERVENED IN THAT BLAZE
LUCKILY THESE VORACIOUS ANIMALS HAVE POOR EYESIGHT
TRACES OF LAVA SLAG AND BASALTIC ROCK WERE EVERYWHERE BUT I COULDN'T FIND THE CRATER THAT HAD VOMITED THEM UP
THROUGH THE LOUNGE'S OPEN WINDOWS I SAW LARGE FRIGHTENED FISH PASSING LIKE PHANTOMS IN THE FIERY WATERS
ENOUGH
RIGHT OFF I DETECTED AN ODOR PERMEATING THE COMPARTMENT THAT WAS SUI GENERIS CAPTAIN NEMO NOTICED THE NEGATIVE IMPRESSION IT MADE ON ME
DROPLETS OF WATER CHANGED INTO EXPLODING TUFTS
LOOK HERE I WENT ON AS YET THERE'S NO CAUSE FOR DESPAIR
VANIKORO THIS NAME WAS MAGIC
WE WERE RACING NORTH-NORTHEAST WITH FRIGHTFUL SPEED FIFTY METERS DOWN
THE NAUTILUS'S CHIEF OFFICER SUPERVISED US
ONLY IF THEY'RE ATTACKED I REPLIED
THEY'RE INDEED ABLE TO FASCINATE A NATURALIST
SCIENCE HAS DEFINED THE GLOBAL PATHS OF FIVE CHIEF CURRENTS
WHAT CHANGES HAD COME OVER HIM
THEN I SANK INTO DEEP SPECULATION AND CAPTAIN NEMO'S STRANGE FACIAL SEIZURE KEPT HAUNTING ME
THE CABIN WAS DARK
A DEFINITE DROWSINESS OVERCAME US
I SQUEEZED IT IN AN INVOLUNTARY CONVULSION
THE BOWHEAD WHALE OR RIGHT WHALE ACCORDING TO THE ENGLISH WHICH HAS NO DORSAL FIN
SEEMINGLY THE MOMENT THIS ENORMOUS NARWHALE CAME UP TO BREATHE AT THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN AIR WAS SUCKED INTO ITS LUNGS LIKE STEAM INTO THE HUGE CYLINDERS OF A 2,000-HORSEPOWER ENGINE
I WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS
THE MAN DREW NEAR AND GLUING HIS FACE TO THE PANEL HE STARED AT US
CAPTAIN NEMO'S FIRST WORDS WERE SPOKEN TO THE CANADIAN
HERE THEY FOUND MERELY A PASSAGEWAY FOR GOING FROM THE ANTARCTIC OCEAN TO OPEN SEA AT THE POLE
SO NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON I ASSUMED THAT THESE TWO ISLANDS PLUS THE MANY ISLETS SURROUNDING THEM USED TO BE PART OF THE MAGELLAN COASTLINE
THEN WE RAISED THE FIJI ISLANDS WHERE SAVAGES SLAUGHTERED SAILORS FROM THE UNION AS WELL AS CAPTAIN BUREAU COMMANDER OF THE DARLING JOSEPHINE OUT OF NANTES FRANCE
THESE OBSERVATIONS PARTLY APPLY HERE
I DISCUSSED THE QUESTION IN ITS EVERY ASPECT BOTH POLITICAL AND SCIENTIFIC AND THIS IS AN EXCERPT FROM THE WELL-PADDED ARTICLE I PUBLISHED IN THE ISSUE OF APRIL 30
WE GASPED
IN THOSE NEWSPAPERS SHORT OF COPY YOU SAW THE REAPPEARANCE OF EVERY GIGANTIC IMAGINARY CREATURE FROM MOBY DICK THAT DREADFUL WHITE WHALE FROM THE HIGH ARCTIC REGIONS TO THE STUPENDOUS KRAKEN WHOSE TENTACLES COULD ENTWINE A 500-TON CRAFT AND DRAG IT INTO THE OCEAN DEPTHS
THEY MEASURED UP TO FIFTEEN METERS IN HEIGHT OVER A LENGTH OF 150 TO 175 METERS AND THE SPEED OF THEIR PROPAGATION HALF THAT OF THE WIND WAS FIFTEEN METERS PER SECOND
DIDN'T I LEAD TEN MONTHS OF THIS OTHERWORLDLY EXISTENCE
I OPENED IT GENTLY
THAT'S THE LAW FOR EVERYONE ON BOARD THE NAUTILUS
I LOOKED AT THE CAPTAIN
MY PICK NEARLY SLIPPED FROM MY HANDS
A PROFOUND SILENCE REIGNED ON BOARD
I WENT BELOW TO THE CABIN OCCUPIED BY NED LAND AND CONSEIL AND I INFORMED THEM OF THE CAPTAIN'S DECISION
WHILE HE TOOK HIS SIGHTS WITH HIS SEXTANT ONE OF THE NAUTILUS'S SAILORS THAT MUSCULAR MAN WHO HAD GONE WITH US TO CRESPO ISLAND DURING OUR FIRST UNDERWATER EXCURSION--CAME UP TO CLEAN THE GLASS PANES OF THE BEACON
WAS THE NAUTILUS BEING DRAGGED INTO THIS WHIRLPOOL JUST AS THE SKIFF WAS ABOUT TO DETACH FROM ITS PLATING
SO THE NAUTILUS HAD TO HALT IN ITS VENTURESOME COURSE AMONG THESE TRACTS OF ICE
CAPTAIN NEMO GUIDED THE NAUTILUS NEXT TO THE ANIMAL'S CORPSE
THE NEXT DAY FEBRUARY 16 WE LEFT THIS BASIN WHICH TALLIES DEPTHS OF 3,000 METERS BETWEEN RHODES AND ALEXANDRIA AND PASSING WELL OUT FROM CERIGO ISLAND AFTER DOUBLING CAPE MATAPAN THE NAUTILUS LEFT THE GREEK ISLANDS BEHIND
CROWDING THE ROCKS OTHER FOWL WATCHED WITHOUT FEAR AS WE PASSED AND PRESSED FAMILIARLY AGAINST OUR FEET
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE LOW TIDE SOME OF THEM HAD MOVED FORWARD OVER THE HEADS OF CORAL TO WITHIN TWO CABLE LENGTHS OF THE NAUTILUS
THEY MORE THAN EQUALED THE ONE THAT THE EXPLORER TAVERNIER SOLD THE SHAH OF PERSIA FOR 3,000,000 FRANCS AND THEY SURPASSED THAT OTHER PEARL OWNED BY THE IMAM OF MUSCAT WHICH I HAD BELIEVED TO BE UNRIVALED IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
WALRUSES RESEMBLE SEALS IN THE SHAPE OF THEIR BODIES AND THE ARRANGEMENT OF THEIR LIMBS
THE REMORAS I HAD OBSERVED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WERE RELATED TO THIS SPECIES
WHAT ABOUT OUR WEAPONS I ASKED HIM
BUT IT WAS CONTENT TO LET ITS ADVERSARY APPROACH AND THEN IT WOULD QUICKLY RESUME ITS RETREATING WAYS
AND FINALLY ALLOW ME TO OFFER YOU SOME MARMALADE OF SEA ANEMONE EQUAL TO THAT FROM THE TASTIEST FRUITS SO I SAMPLED AWAY MORE AS A CURIOSITY SEEKER THAN AN EPICURE WHILE CAPTAIN NEMO DELIGHTED ME WITH HIS INCREDIBLE ANECDOTES
IT DIDN'T STIR AND SEEMED TO BE SLEEPING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SHOULD HAVE MADE IT EASIER TO CAPTURE
A CRUST OF CAKED GRAVEL PROTECTED IT FROM ANY MOLLUSKS THAT MIGHT BORE INTO IT
AND IN TRUTH THE NATIVES SEEMED AFRAID THAT DUMONT D'URVILLE HAD COME TO AVENGE THE COUNT DE LA PéROUSE AND HIS UNFORTUNATE COMPANIONS
WHAT ROARS ECHOING FROM SEVERAL MILES AWAY
THE HOTEL ELEVATOR DROPPED US OFF IN THE MAIN VESTIBULE ON THE MEZZANINE
IT GREW ROCKIER AND SEEMED TO BE STREWN WITH PUDDING STONES AND A BASALTIC GRAVEL CALLED TUFF TOGETHER WITH BITS OF LAVA AND SULFUROUS OBSIDIAN
OUR MEAL PROCEEDED PRETTY MUCH IN SILENCE
BUT PRECISELY BECAUSE SAILORS LUCK HAS LED ME INTO THESE SEAS ON MARCH 21 IT WILL BE EASY TO GET OUR BEARINGS IF THE NOONDAY SUN DOES APPEAR BEFORE OUR EYES WHY EASY CAPTAIN BECAUSE WHEN THE ORB OF DAY SWEEPS IN SUCH LONG SPIRALS IT'S DIFFICULT TO MEASURE ITS EXACT ALTITUDE ABOVE THE HORIZON AND OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OPEN TO COMMITTING SERIOUS ERRORS THEN WHAT CAN YOU DO I USE ONLY MY CHRONOMETER CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED ME
PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CAPTAIN SAID TO ME WOULD YOU CONSENT TO GIVE YOUR MEDICAL ATTENTIONS TO ONE OF MY MEN SOMEONE IS SICK YES I'M READY TO GO WITH YOU COME I ADMIT THAT MY HEART WAS POUNDING
I'LL SKIP OVER THE CANADIAN'S COMPLAINTS
THEY WERE A SPECIES OF STERNA NILOTICA UNIQUE TO EGYPT
FORCIBLY SEIZED NED LAND AND CONSEIL WERE BEHIND ME
IN MIDOCEAN THIS STOIC LAD SEEMED RIGHT AT HOME
IT RESTED SERENELY SHELTERED FROM THE SEA'S MOTIONS UNDER A PRESSURE FAVORABLE TO THE TRANSMISSION OF THAT ELECTRIC SPARK THAT GOES FROM AMERICA TO EUROPE IN 32/100 OF A SECOND
MY EYES SCANNED THE DISTANCE AND TOOK IN A VAST AREA LIT BY INTENSE FLASHES OF LIGHT
THE NAUTILUS ENTERED THE STRAIT OF JUBAL WHICH LEADS TO THE GULF OF SUEZ
THIS DELICIOUS PRODUCE FROM THE TORRID ZONES RIPENS ALL YEAR ROUND AND MALAYSIANS WHO GIVE THEM THE NAME PISANG EAT THEM WITHOUT BOTHERING TO COOK THEM
IS IT INDISCREET TO ASK HOW YOU DISCOVERED THIS TUNNEL SIR THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED ME THERE CAN BE NO SECRETS BETWEEN MEN WHO WILL NEVER LEAVE EACH OTHER I IGNORED THIS INNUENDO AND WAITED FOR CAPTAIN NEMO'S EXPLANATION
A BROTHER LAYS DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS BROTHER A FRIEND FOR HIS FRIEND WHAT COULD BE SIMPLER
I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF LOST IN MY THOUGHTS
IT'S A FASCINATING SPORT
SO THE AIR INSIDE HADN'T BEEN RENEWED
THEY CARRIED OUT CERTAIN PROCEDURES THAT ON THE NAUTILUS YOU COULD CALL CLEARING THE DECKS FOR ACTION THEY WERE QUITE SIMPLE
ITS TANKS WERE MANUFACTURED BY CAIL CO
HIS REQUEST GRANTED I DECIDED TO DISPOSE OF IT IMMEDIATELY
LEAVING THE NAUTILUS UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE JUMPING OFF A TRAIN RACING AT THIS SPEED A RASH MOVE IF THERE EVER WAS ONE
AT THE TIME I HAD SHIPPED ABOARD THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN THIS WHOLE ISLAND WAS IN REBELLION AGAINST ITS TYRANNICAL RULERS THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE OF TURKEY
WELL HOW ABOUT YOU CONSEIL
THIS NOISE EXISTED PERHAPS ONLY IN MY IMAGINATION
NOT IN THE LEAST WELL COME ALONG AND YOU'LL SEE I HEADED TO THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY
DO YOU ACCEPT THIS CONDITION SO THINGS HAPPENED ON BOARD THAT WERE QUITE ODD TO SAY THE LEAST THINGS NEVER TO BE SEEN BY PEOPLE NOT PLACING THEMSELVES BEYOND SOCIETY'S LAWS
BUT A GREAT MANY OTHERS WERE YELLOWISH AND GELATINOUS JUST BEGGING TO BE PICKED
NO I CAN'T DESCRIBE THE EXCITEMENT THAT SHOOK MY VERY BEING
I WENT LOOKING IN THE LIBRARY FOR A BOOK ABOUT THIS ISLAND ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE IN THE WORLD
THIS CONVOY WAS SUPPOSED TO PUT INTO CADIZ BUT AFTER LEARNING THAT THE ENGLISH FLEET LAY ACROSS THOSE WATERWAYS THE ADMIRAL DECIDED TO MAKE FOR A FRENCH PORT
EXACTLY
ALL RIGHT I ADMIT IT
THE CAPTAIN DID NOT STIR
YES MY BOY I REPLIED
THE RELEVANT DATA ON THIS APPARITION AS RECORDED IN VARIOUS LOGBOOKS AGREED PRETTY CLOSELY AS TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE OBJECT OR CREATURE IN QUESTION ITS UNPRECEDENTED SPEED OF MOVEMENT ITS STARTLING LOCOMOTIVE POWER AND THE UNIQUE VITALITY WITH WHICH IT SEEMED TO BE GIFTED
A STEWARD APPEARED
WOULD HE HEAD UP TO THE SHORES OF ASIA
HIS STATEROOM HAD TO BE DESERTED
THE BAROMETER FELL SIGNIFICANTLY INDICATING A TREMENDOUS TENSION IN THE SURROUNDING HAZE
NED LAND AND CONSEIL AVOIDED SPEAKING TO ME AFRAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEMSELVES AWAY
BUT NOT KNOWING WHAT HE WAS DRIVING AT I WAITED FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS READY TO REPLY AS CIRCUMSTANCES DICTATED
I SOON GREW ACCUSTOMED TO THIS BIZARRE ARRANGEMENT LIKEWISE TO THE COMPARATIVE DARKNESS SURROUNDING US
MY EYES FLEW TO THE SIDE WHERE LAND LAY BUT I SAW ONLY A BLURRED LINE COVERING THREE-QUARTERS OF THE HORIZON FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHWEST
BRACHYURA MACRURA AND ANOMURA
MEANWHILE HIS PHOTOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS OVER CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME
I RECOGNIZED THE JAVANESE EEL A GENUINE EIGHT-DECIMETER SERPENT WITH A BLUISH GRAY BELLY WHICH WITHOUT THE GOLD LINES OVER ITS FLANKS COULD EASILY BE CONFUSED WITH THE CONGER EEL
THE FURNACE THAT WAS THE SOURCE OF THIS INEXPLICABLE LIGHT OCCUPIED THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
THE OTHERS HAD RUGGED BLACK SURFACES MEASURED UP TO FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS IN WIDTH AND WERE TEN OR MORE YEARS OLD
PUDDING STONES AND TRACHYTE GAVE WAY TO BLACK BASALTIC ROCK
THE CANADIAN STARED AT CONSEIL THEN HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
I WAS CROUCHING
HIS TEETH WERE HALF BARED
NEITHER ENGLISH FRENCH NOR GERMAN THAT'S ALL WE CAN SAY
WHILE THE NAUTILUS WAS CLEARING A PATH THROUGH THEIR TIGHT RANKS CONSEIL COULDN'T REFRAIN FROM MAKING THIS COMMENT
I DISTINGUISHED THE UNPREDICTABLY CONTOURED SPRINGINGS OF A VAULT SUPPORTED BY NATURAL PILLARS FIRMLY BASED ON A GRANITE FOUNDATION LIKE THE WEIGHTY COLUMNS OF TUSCAN ARCHITECTURE
THIS HOMERIC SLAUGHTER DRAGGED ON FOR AN HOUR AND THE LONG-SKULLED PREDATORS COULDN'T GET AWAY
A PILE OF GIGANTIC STONE BLOCKS AN ENORMOUS GRANITE CLIFFSIDE PITTED WITH DARK CAVES BUT NOT OFFERING A SINGLE GRADIENT WE COULD CLIMB UP
LET'S RIDE IT OUT AS YOU SEAFARING FELLOWS SAY
EITHER THEY STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL OR THEY BECOME EMBEDDED IN THE CREATURE'S FOLDS
WE HAVE NOT FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF CANNIBALS JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE A HABIT OF IT THE CANADIAN REPLIED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T INDULGE FROM TIME TO TIME
WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS DIGGING IF I WAS TO DIE SMOTHERED AND CRUSHED BY THIS WATER TURNING TO STONE A TORTURE UNDREAMED OF BY EVEN THE WILDEST SAVAGES
THE CRANIUM HAD BEEN SMASHED OPEN BY SOME BLUNT INSTRUMENT LEAVING THE NAKED BRAINS EXPOSED AND THE CEREBRAL MATTER HAD SUFFERED DEEP ABRASIONS
AND WE WENT BACK TO THE NAUTILUS AMID FLURRIES IN THE AIR
THE ICE BANK'S SIDE WALLS AND UNDERBELLY HAD VISIBLY THICKENED
272 AN ENGAVING BY GUILLAUMOT
I ALSO OBSERVED SOME WONDERFUL SNAPPERS BELONGING TO THE ORDER LUTIANIDA SACRED FISH FOR THE GREEKS WHO CLAIMED THEY COULD DRIVE OFF SEA MONSTERS FROM THE WATERS THEY FREQUENT
LIKE HIS MASTER LIKE HIS COMRADE NED HE'S A BACHELOR
BUT THIS ISN'T THE PLACE WHERE YOU'LL PERISH
FROM ITS GLARE AND WHITENESS I RECOGNIZED THE ELECTRIC GLOW THAT HAD PLAYED AROUND THIS UNDERWATER BOAT LIKE SOME MAGNIFICENT PHOSPHORESCENT PHENOMENON
THERE ALSO WERE STONY MASSES BURIED BENEATH CARPETS OF AXIDIA AND SEA ANEMONE BRISTLING WITH LONG VERTICAL WATER PLANTS THEN STRANGELY CONTOURED BLOCKS OF LAVA THAT TESTIFIED TO ALL THE FURY OF THOSE PLUTONIC DEVELOPMENTS
WE'LL SHOW YOU A STYLE OF HUNTING WITH WHICH YOU AREN'T YET FAMILIAR
I SAID NO ADDING THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT
SIR I TOLD HIM TO TAKE UP THIS SUBJECT A SECOND TIME WOULD BE DISTASTEFUL TO BOTH OF US
FRANCE AND ENGLAND AREN'T FAR OFF AND THERE WE'LL EASILY FIND REFUGE
AMONG THE FISH THAT THE NAUTILUS STARTLED ON ITS WAY I'LL MENTION A ONE-METER LUMPFISH BLACKISH ON TOP WITH ORANGE ON THE BELLY AND RARE AMONG ITS BRETHREN IN THAT IT PRACTICES MONOGAMY A GOOD-SIZED EELPOUT A TYPE OF EMERALD MORAY WHOSE FLAVOR IS EXCELLENT WOLFFISH WITH BIG EYES IN A HEAD SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING A CANINE'S VIVIPAROUS BLENNIES WHOSE EGGS HATCH INSIDE THEIR BODIES LIKE THOSE OF SNAKES BLOATED GOBIO OR BLACK GUDGEON MEASURING TWO DECIMETERS GRENADIERS WITH LONG TAILS AND GLEAMING WITH A SILVERY GLOW SPEEDY FISH VENTURING FAR FROM THEIR HIGH ARCTIC SEAS
WE HADN'T GONE TWO CABLE LENGTHS WHEN A HUNDRED SAVAGES HOWLING AND GESTICULATING ENTERED THE WATER UP TO THEIR WAISTS
ELECTRIC LIGHT FLOODED THIS WHOLE HARMONIOUS TOTALITY FALLING FROM FOUR FROSTED HALF GLOBES SET IN THE SCROLLWORK OF THE CEILING
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER IT'S AN ACTUAL MERMAID THAT WORD SIREN PUT ME BACK ON TRACK AND I REALIZED THAT THE ANIMAL BELONGED TO THE ORDER SIRENIA
DO YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR REASONS FOR BEING SO SKEPTICAL THE HARPOONER STARED AT ME AWHILE BEFORE REPLYING SLAPPED HIS BROAD FOREHEAD IN ONE OF HIS STANDARD GESTURES CLOSED HIS EYES AS IF TO COLLECT HIMSELF AND FINALLY SAID
BUT MANY CENTURIES HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN AND THIS SUBMERGED VOLCANO HAS CHANGED INTO A PEACEFUL CAVERN THAT'S FINE NED LAND ANSWERED
A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER WHOSE SURFACE AREA IS 25,000,000 SQUARE MILES WITH A LENGTH OF 9,000 MILES AND AN AVERAGE WIDTH OF 2,700
DURING THIS NAVIGATING IN THE MIDST OF THE ICE CAPTAIN NEMO OFTEN STAYED ON THE PLATFORM
AND BESIDES HOW COULD THIS POOR INDIAN EVER HAVE GUESSED THAT HUMAN BEINGS CREATURES LIKE HIMSELF WERE NEAR HIM UNDER THE WATERS EAVESDROPPING ON HIS MOVEMENTS NOT MISSING A SINGLE DETAIL OF HIS FISHING
TEN METERS AWAY I COULD SEE ITS GAPING HULL INTO WHICH WATER WAS RUSHING WITH A SOUND OF THUNDER THEN ITS DOUBLE ROWS OF CANNONS AND RAILINGS
FOR SEVEN MONTHS WE'VE BEEN ABOARD YOUR VESSEL AND I ASK YOU TODAY IN THE NAME OF MY COMPANIONS AS WELL AS MYSELF IF YOU INTEND TO KEEP US HERE FOREVER PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO SAID I'LL ANSWER YOU TODAY JUST AS I DID SEVEN MONTHS AGO
RIGHT AFTER CATCHING THEM OUR SEAMEN DROPPED THEM IN BUCKETS OF WATER
HARPOONS USED FOR HUNTING WHALES ARE USUALLY ATTACHED TO A VERY LONG ROPE THAT PAYS OUT QUICKLY WHEN THE WOUNDED ANIMAL DRAGS IT WITH HIM
EVENLY HEATED BY ALL ITS ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR DEFIED THE MOST INTENSE COLD
ITS DECK PANELING OPENED THE SKIFF WAS WRENCHED FROM ITS SOCKET AND LAUNCHED TO SEA
WITH EACH PASSING YEAR THE MOLLUSK'S SECRETIONS ADDED NEW CONCENTRIC LAYERS
THEY WERE ARMED IN THE SAME FASHION AND NED LAND WAS ALSO BRANDISHING AN ENORMOUS HARPOON HE HAD STOWED IN THE SKIFF BEFORE LEAVING THE NAUTILUS
OR RATHER I SUPPOSE IT WILL BE OVER WHEN THESE SEAS HAVE NOTHING MORE TO TEACH US
ARE YOU A PHYSICIAN PROFESSOR ARONNAX THIS INQUIRY WAS SO UNEXPECTED THAT I STARED AT HIM A GOOD WHILE WITHOUT REPLYING
THE NEXT DAY JANUARY 26 WE CUT THE EQUATOR ON THE 82ND MERIDIAN AND WE REENTERED THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE
HERE I SAW NO FINE-GRAINED SAND NO UNDERWATER PRAIRIES NOT ONE OPEN-SEA FOREST
BUT THESE WATERWAYS STREWN WITH ISLANDS AND PLOWED BY STEAMERS PROBABLY DIDN'T AGREE WITH CAPTAIN NEMO
MOREOVER CAPTAIN NEMO'S RECLUSIVENESS HIS CHANGED DISPOSITION AND ESPECIALLY HIS TOTAL SILENCE SINCE THE BATTLE WITH THE DEVILFISH ALL MADE ME SEE THINGS IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT
I OPENED THE DOOR LEADING TO THE LIBRARY
AN IMMENSE SHORE A CHAOTIC HEAP OF ROCKS AND ICE WHOSE LIMITS WE COULDN'T SEE
THERE SHAPED LIKE ACTUAL PRISMS AND ARRANGED INTO A SERIES OF COLUMNS THAT SUPPORTED THE SPRINGINGS OF THIS IMMENSE VAULT A WONDERFUL SAMPLE OF NATURAL ARCHITECTURE
ARABIAN TUNNEL 170 6
MUCH TO MY SURPRISE I WAS IN MY STATEROOM
WE USE THE ROUQUAYROL-DENAYROUZE DEVICE INVENTED BY TWO OF YOUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN BUT REFINED BY ME FOR MY OWN SPECIAL USES THEREBY ENABLING YOU TO RISK THESE NEW PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS WITHOUT SUFFERING ANY ORGANIC DISORDERS
WITH THE SAME NEGATIVE RESULT
THE LAST GLEAMS OF TWILIGHT WERE MELTING INTO NIGHT
THERE WAS JUST TIME TO RUN TO THE RESCUE OF THE BALEEN WHALES
SINCE THE PUBLIC INTEREST WAS AT STAKE AND TRANSOCEANIC TRAVEL WAS SUFFERING THE SINCERITY OF THESE GOVERNMENTS COULD NOT BE DOUBTED
WELL NO
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING TO KNOW HIS THOUGHTS TO SHARE THEM UNDERSTAND THEM
JUST THEN RESTING HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER CAPTAIN NEMO SAID TO ME
THE CREW WERE WORKING UP INTO A BLIND RAGE
HERE A HUGE BONEYARD FORMS FROM FISH MOLLUSKS AND ZOOPHYTES DYING OVER IT BY THE BILLIONS
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW SO THEY SUPPOSE SO AND HERE'S THE LOGIC WITH WHICH THEY BACK UP THEIR BELIEFS
FAR OFF LIKE A SLEEPING CETACEAN
I FELT IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF ALARM
IT WON'T HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY GETTING REPAIRS AT THE NEAREST PORT AH COMMANDER I EXCLAIMED WITH CONVICTION YOUR NAUTILUS IS TRULY A MARVELOUS BOAT YES PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED WITH GENUINE EXCITEMENT AND I LOVE IT AS IF IT WERE MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE WERE OPEN AND SINCE THE NAUTILUS'S BEACON WAS OFF A HAZY DARKNESS REIGNED IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS
THE NAUTILUS BROKE THESE WATERS WITH THE EDGE OF ITS SPUR AFTER DOING NEARLY 10,000 LEAGUES IN THREE AND A HALF MONTHS A TRACK LONGER THAN A GREAT CIRCLE OF THE EARTH
ETC
THEN SIR I WENT ON YOU GIVE US QUITE SIMPLY A CHOICE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH QUITE SIMPLY MY FRIENDS I SAID TO A QUESTION COUCHED IN THESE TERMS OUR ANSWER CAN BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED
CONSEQUENTLY IT MUST HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY A PERFORATING TOOL OF UNCOMMON TOUGHNESS PLUS AFTER BEING LAUNCHED WITH PRODIGIOUS POWER AND THEN PIERCING FOUR CENTIMETERS OF SHEET IRON THIS TOOL HAD NEEDED TO WITHDRAW ITSELF BY A BACKWARD MOTION TRULY INEXPLICABLE
TRY THIS CIGAR PROFESSOR ARONNAX AND EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T COME FROM HAVANA IT WILL SATISFY YOU IF YOU'RE A CONNOISSEUR I TOOK THE CIGAR OFFERED ME WHOSE SHAPE RECALLED THOSE FROM CUBA
MOREOVER HE ENJOYED EXCELLENT HEALTH THAT DEFIED ALL AILMENTS OWNED SOLID MUSCLES BUT HADN'T A NERVE IN HIM NOT A SIGN OF NERVES THE MENTAL TYPE I MEAN
OUR CHIEF OFFICER LOADED THE BLUNDERBUSSES WHICH CAN LAUNCH HARPOONS AS FAR AS A MILE AND LONG DUCK GUNS WITH EXPLODING BULLETS THAT CAN MORTALLY WOUND EVEN THE MOST POWERFUL ANIMALS
BUT FRIEND LAND IS NO DOUBT MISTAKEN BECAUSE I DON'T SEE A THING THAT'S REGRETTABLE CONSEIL ANSWERED
THE TORRES STRAIT IS REGARDED AS NO LESS DANGEROUS FOR ITS BRISTLING REEFS THAN FOR THE SAVAGE INHABITANTS OF ITS COASTS
THREE SECONDS AFTER READING THIS LETTER FROM THE HONORABLE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY I UNDERSTOOD AT LAST THAT MY TRUE VOCATION MY SOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE WAS TO HUNT DOWN THIS DISTURBING MONSTER AND RID THE WORLD OF IT
THAT'S ONE BIG ANIMAL
NO DOUBT SIR YOU'VE FELT THAT I WAITED RATHER TOO LONG BEFORE PAYING YOU THIS SECOND VISIT
THIS ISLAND SEEMS UNINHABITED BUT IT STILL MIGHT HARBOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO AREN'T SO FINICKY ABOUT THE SORT OF GAME THEY EAT HEE HEE NED PUT IN WITH A MEANINGFUL MOVEMENT OF HIS JAWS
IT WAS TRAVELING BACKWARD WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE NAUTILUS
AMONG THEM SLITHERED SOME SEA ELEPHANTS A TYPE OF SEAL WITH A SHORT FLEXIBLE TRUNK
WE SPEAK FRENCH ENGLISH GERMAN AND LATIN TO THESE ROGUES AND NEITHER OF THEM HAS THE DECENCY TO EVEN ANSWER BACK CALM DOWN NED I TOLD THE SEETHING HARPOONER
LIKE A COVEY OF SNIPE OVER A MARSH THERE ROSE UNDERFOOT SCHOOLS OF UNUSUAL FISH FROM THE GENUS MONOPTERUS WHOSE MEMBERS HAVE NO FIN BUT THEIR TAIL
AT A DEPTH OF 1,000 FEET IT STOPPED
OH IT'S YOU
YOU OBSERVE THAT I'VE ENTERED THE NEW ISLETS IN THEIR PLACE BUT WILL THIS CHANNEL FILL UP ONE DAY VERY LIKELY PROFESSOR ARONNAX BECAUSE SINCE 1866 EIGHT LITTLE LAVA ISLETS HAVE SURGED UP IN FRONT OF THE PORT OF ST NICOLAS ON PALEA KAMENI
BUT ONE QUESTION PERHAPS INDISCREET NATURALLY POPPED UP AND I COULDN'T RESIST ASKING IT
WE'LL STICK OURSELVES INSIDE UNDO THE BOLTS AND RISE TO THE SURFACE WITHOUT THE HELMSMAN IN THE BOW SEEING A THING FINE NED
I KNOW HE TOLD ME IN THAT CALM TONE THE MOST DREADFUL OUTLOOK COULDN'T CHANGE
NOTHING REMOTELY RESEMBLING A GIGANTIC NARWHALE OR AN UNDERWATER ISLET OR A DERELICT SHIPWRECK OR A RUNAWAY REEF OR ANYTHING THE LEAST BIT UNEARTHLY
HE DIDN'T ADDRESS A WORD TO ME
ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT
LIKE TURTLES ARMADILLOS SEA URCHINS AND CRUSTACEANS THESE FISH ARE PROTECTED BY ARMOR PLATE THAT'S NEITHER CHALKY NOR STONY BUT ACTUAL BONE
UNFORTUNATELY I SAID THIS PASTA WON'T STAY FRESH SO IT SEEMS POINTLESS TO MAKE A SUPPLY FOR ON BOARD BY THUNDER SIR NED LAND EXCLAIMED
THE NAUTILUS CRUISED BENEATH THE WATERS ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY
THE CAPTAIN APPROACHED AND STUCK HIS DAGGER VERTICALLY BETWEEN THE SHELLS TO DISCOURAGE ANY IDEAS ABOUT CLOSING
MASTER MUSTN'T LOOK WITH THAT CONSEIL CLAPPED HIS HANDS OVER HIS EYES
AS FOR THE NAUTILUS IT SEEMED AS TRANQUIL AND MYSTERIOUS AS EVER
CHAPTER 14 THE SOUTH POLE I RUSHED UP ONTO THE PLATFORM
I WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED WITH A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE HULL WHOSE TOPSIDE FORMED A SORT OF HORIZONTAL PLATFORM WHEN I FELT IT SINKING LITTLE BY LITTLE
A FEW MINUTES BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK I GLUED MY EAR TO THE CAPTAIN'S DOOR
WHEN I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK THE QUESTION WAS AT THE BOILING POINT
ALL THESE BOOKS WERE SHELVED INDISCRIMINATELY WITHOUT REGARD TO THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH THEY WERE WRITTEN AND THIS JUMBLE PROVED THAT THE NAUTILUS'S CAPTAIN COULD READ FLUENTLY WHATEVER VOLUMES HE CHANCED TO PICK UP
JUST THEN CAPTAIN NEMO ASKED ME WHAT I KNEW ABOUT THE SHIPWRECK OF THE COUNT DE LA PéROUSE
IT TRULY LIVES UP TO ITS NICKNAME THE LORD OF STORMS
DID THIS HATE ALSO HUNGER FOR VENGEANCE
HEAVING THE LOG WE VERIFIED THAT THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS GOING AT THE RATE OF 18.5 MILES PER HOUR
IN SHORT ALTHOUGH I'M NOT EASILY DISCOURAGED I REALIZED THAT MY CHANCES OF EVER SEEING MY FELLOW MEN AGAIN WERE SHRINKING BY THE DAY ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN CAPTAIN NEMO WAS RECKLESSLY RACING TOWARD THE SOUTH ATLANTIC
WE'RE GOING ASTERN CONSEIL SAID
SO IMPRISONMENT WASN'T ENOUGH TO CONCEAL CAPTAIN NEMO'S PLANS FROM US SLEEP WAS NEEDED AS WELL
WOULD MY RETURNING TO THIS SUBJECT AROUSE SUSPICIONS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR ESCAPE PLANS IF WE HAD PROMISING CIRCUMSTANCES FOR TRYING AGAIN LATER ON
HOWEVER THE WEATHER HELD GOOD
WALTER UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON UNITS OF MEASURE CABLE LENGTH IN VERNE'S CONTEXT 600 FEET CENTIGRADE 0 DEGREES CENTIGRADE = FREEZING WATER 37 DEGREES CENTIGRADE = HUMAN BODY TEMPERATURE 100 DEGREES CENTIGRADE = BOILING WATER FATHOM 6 FEET GRAM ROUGHLY 1/28 OF AN OUNCE
MY HEART WAS POUNDING MIGHTILY
MY HEART WAS POUNDING MIGHTILY
WE COULD HAVE BEEN CRUSHED BETWEEN THESE MASSES OF ICE OR AT LEAST IMPRISONED BETWEEN THEM
HERE TOO ERRATICALLY DRIFTING CHUNKS COLLECT FROM THE ICE BREAKUP
I OWED IT TO MYSELF NED BOWED WITHOUT ANSWERING HIM
IN YET ANOTHER A SOLDIER WITH HIS SABER
ONCE THIS VOYAGE WAS OVER MIGHT NOT CAPTAIN NEMO CONSENT TO SET US FREE IN RETURN FOR OUR PROMISE NEVER TO REVEAL HIS EXISTENCE
THE THERMOMETER MARKED 12 DEGREES CENTIGRADE AND A FRESH BREEZE LEFT A SHARP NIP IN THE AIR
NOW WE'LL EAT RED MEAT
JUST SUCH A BASIN IS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN TO THE GULF STREAM AND THE SARGASSO SEA IS THE CENTER OF THE WHIRL I SHARE MAURY'S VIEW AND I WAS ABLE TO STUDY THE PHENOMENON IN THIS EXCLUSIVE SETTING WHERE SHIPS RARELY GO
THIS DAY OF WAITING SEEMED ENDLESS
AS A MATTER OF FACT THE SAME VIEWS CAN ALSO BE FOUND IN ARRIAN AGATHARCHIDES AND ARTEMIDORUS ONE CAN EASILY SEE I ANSWERED THAT THOSE HISTORIANS DIDN'T NAVIGATE ABOARD THE NAUTILUS INDEED THE CAPTAIN REPLIED WITH A SMILE AND IN THIS RESPECT THE MODERNS AREN'T MUCH FARTHER ALONG THAN THE ANCIENTS
AND NOTE WELL EVEN WHEN ONE HAS GRASPED ALL THIS ONE STILL KNOWS NEXT TO NOTHING BECAUSE THESE FAMILIES ARE SUBDIVIDED INTO GENERA SUBGENERA SPECIES VARIETIES ALL RIGHT CONSEIL MY FRIEND THE HARPOONER SAID LEANING TOWARD THE GLASS PANEL HERE COME A COUPLE OF YOUR VARIETIES NOW YES
AS FOR NED LAND NO HUMAN SHOULDERS EVER EXECUTED A HIGHER SHRUG THAN THE PAIR BELONGING TO OUR CANADIAN
I'M THE LAW I'M THE TRIBUNAL
HERE ARE SOME LARGE-SCALE CHARTS ON WHICH YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THAT COURSE
ALL RIGHT LISTEN AND LEARN NED MY FRIEND
IN SHORT DINNER WAS EXCELLENT
THE TEMPERATURE WAS FAIRLY LOW
THAT HORRIBLE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION KEPT REPEATING IN MY MIND'S EYE
AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE SUBMERGED PART OF THIS ICE BANK IS IN A FOUR-TO-ONE RATIO TO ITS EMERGING PART VERY NEARLY PROFESSOR
HOW BEAUTIFUL CONSEIL EXCLAIMED
A HALF HOUR STILL TO WAIT
IT WAS BEST NOT TO MEET HIM FACE TO FACE
SOMETIMES THE MURKY OCEAN SPARKLED BENEATH MOONBEAMS THAT DARTED BETWEEN THE FRINGES OF TWO CLOUDS
THEY WERE HAULED IN STILL STICKING TO THE TURTLES THAT CAME ABOARD WITH THEM
NOW THEN THE TIDES AREN'T STRONG IN THE PACIFIC AND IF YOU CAN'T UNBALLAST THE NAUTILUS WHICH SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO ME I DON'T SEE HOW IT WILL FLOAT OFF YOU'RE RIGHT PROFESSOR THE PACIFIC TIDES AREN'T STRONG CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED
ITS PROPELLER HAD BEEN DISENTANGLED BUT WAS BARELY PUT TO USE
HERE ARE SOME PRESERVES OF SEA CUCUMBER THAT A MALAYSIAN WOULD DECLARE TO BE UNRIVALED IN THE ENTIRE WORLD HERE'S CREAM FROM MILK FURNISHED BY THE UDDERS OF CETACEANS AND SUGAR FROM THE HUGE FUCUS PLANTS IN THE NORTH SEA
THE SKY WAS GROWING BRIGHTER
WE NEED TO ACT SHREWDLY AND YOUR FLARE-UPS WON'T GIVE RISE TO ANY PROMISING OPPORTUNITIES
IT WOULDN'T DO TO EVEN DREAM OF ESCAPING AND I'LL LET THE READER DECIDE HOW PROMPTLY THE CANADIAN THREW A TANTRUM WHEN I VENTURED TO TELL HIM OUR SITUATION
I'LL GO ALONG WITH ANYTHING YOU WANT EXCEPT THAT
CONSEIL REJOINED ME AND GLUING HIS HUGE COPPER CAPSULE TO MINE HIS EYES GAVE ME A FRIENDLY GREETING
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WHO WOULDN'T HAVE MISTAKEN IT FOR A GIGANTIC CETACEAN
PICKS RANG OUT ON THAT BED OF ICE
HERE IS WHAT THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES ENTAILED
HE SCALED AN OVERHANGING ROCK THAT ENDED IN A SMALL PROMONTORY AND THERE MUTE AND MOTIONLESS WITH CROSSED ARMS AND BLAZING EYES HE SEEMED TO BE LAYING CLAIM TO THESE SOUTHERNMOST REGIONS
SOMETIMES HE WOULD STOP CROSS HIS ARMS OVER HIS CHEST AND OBSERVE THE SEA
DANGER HOWEVER GREAT HELD A PERENNIAL ATTRACTION FOR HIS AGGRESSIVE NATURE
I WAS EXPECTING THIS VISIT
ON THE ROCKY VOLCANIC SEAFLOOR THERE BLOOMED QUITE A COLLECTION OF MOVING FLORA
AS FOR FISH I SPECIFICALLY OBSERVED SOME BONY FISH BELONGING TO THE GOBY GENUS ESPECIALLY SOME GUDGEON TWO DECIMETERS LONG SPRINKLED WITH WHITISH AND YELLOW SPOTS
I CLIMBED AS FAR AS THE HATCH
NED MY FRIEND I TOLD HIM I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL BUT YOU MUSTN'T BLAME YOURSELF
FORGETTING HIS REGULATION LANGUAGE THIS POOR FRENCHMAN HAD REVERTED TO SPEAKING HIS OWN MOTHER TONGUE TO FLING OUT ONE SUPREME PLEA
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE END NED LAND SAID
THIS INEXPLICABLE PHENOMENON IS THUS EXPLAINED AWAY--UNLESS IT'S SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY WHICH DESPITE EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN SIGHTED STUDIED EXPLORED AND EXPERIENCED IS STILL POSSIBLE THESE LAST WORDS WERE COWARDLY OF ME
LAID OUT ON THE PLATFORM IT KEPT STRUGGLING WITH CONVULSIVE MOVEMENTS TRYING TO TURN OVER MAKING SUCH EFFORTS THAT ITS FINAL LUNGE WAS ABOUT TO FLIP IT INTO THE SEA
BUT WITH MR LAND THAT DANGER ISN'T TO BE FEARED
BESIDES THE LONGBOAT'S SOLIDLY BUILT AND A FEW MILES WITH THE WIND BEHIND US IS NO BIG DEAL
BUT WHERE DOES HE GET THOSE MILLIONS NED LAND ASKED
THESE WERE TUNA FROM THE GENUS SCOMBER BLUE-BLACK ON TOP SILVER ON THE BELLY ARMOR THEIR DORSAL STRIPES GIVING OFF A GOLDEN GLEAM
NO SIR I ANSWERED WITH CONVICTION
THEY WERE BLUE SHARKS DREADFUL MAN-EATERS WITH ENORMOUS TAILS DULL GLASSY STARES AND PHOSPHORESCENT MATTER OOZING FROM HOLES AROUND THEIR SNOUTS
BUT WE HAD TO TREAD CAUTIOUSLY IN THE MIDST OF PUDDING STONES THAT WEREN'T CEMENTED TOGETHER AND OUR FEET KEPT SKIDDING ON GLASSY TRACHYTE MADE OF FELDSPAR AND QUARTZ CRYSTALS
CONSEIL COULDN'T COAX A SINGLE WORD OUT OF HIM AND FEARED THAT IN A FIT OF DELIRIUM WHILE UNDER THE SWAY OF A GHASTLY HOMESICKNESS NED WOULD KILL HIMSELF
IF THE FIRST IS CARRIED ON THE BACK THE SECOND IS FASTENED TO THE BELT
ON THE PRESSURE GAUGE A NEEDLE MARKED THE DECREASING PRESSURES THAT INDICATED THE NAUTILUS'S UPWARD PROGRESS
SOON I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE US INTO THE OCEAN DEPTHS YOUR CHARACTERS TRAVELING IN DIVING EQUIPMENT PERFECTED BY YOUR SCIENCE AND YOUR IMAGINATION THUS INSPIRED VERNE CREATED ONE OF LITERATURE'S GREAT REBELS A FREEDOM FIGHTER WHO PLUNGED BENEATH THE WAVES TO WAGE A UNIQUE FORM OF GUERILLA WARFARE
THE POSTURES OF THE FOUR SEAMEN SEEMED GHASTLY TO ME TWISTED FROM CONVULSIVE MOVEMENTS AS IF MAKING A LAST EFFORT TO BREAK LOOSE FROM THE ROPES THAT BOUND THEM TO THEIR SHIP
GREEN PEARLS FROM THE RAINBOW ABALONE
THEN THE DARK MASS DISAPPEARED AND WITH IT A CREW OF CORPSES DRAGGED UNDER BY FEARSOME EDDIES
BUT I COULD BREATHE I COULD INHALE THE LIFE-GIVING SEA AIR
IN REPLY TO A QUESTION CONSEIL ASKED ME ABOUT THE GROWTH RATE OF THESE COLOSSAL BARRIERS I THOROUGHLY AMAZED HIM BY SAYING THAT SCIENTISTS PUT IT AT AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH PER BIENNIUM
PEOPLE SAY THEY'VE SIGHTED THIS SLIPPERY BEAST AGAIN IN THE PACIFIC HIGH SEAS I'M TRULY WILLING TO BELIEVE IT BUT TWO MONTHS HAVE ALREADY GONE BY SINCE THEN AND JUDGING BY YOUR NARWHALE'S PERSONALITY IT HATES GROWING MOLDY FROM HANGING OUT TOO LONG IN THE SAME WATERWAYS
AND EVEN WHEN OUR HEARTS COULD BEAT WITH YOURS MOVED BY SOME OF YOUR GRIEFS OR STIRRED BY YOUR DEEDS OF COURAGE AND GENIUS WE'VE HAD TO STIFLE EVEN THE SLIGHTEST TOKEN OF THAT SYMPATHY THAT ARISES AT THE SIGHT OF SOMETHING FINE AND GOOD WHETHER IT COMES FROM FRIEND OR ENEMY
OH IF ONLY WE COULD SHARE OUR FEELINGS
OUR CONVERSATION LIVELY AT THE OUTSET THEN LANGUISHED
AT NOON ON THIS DAY OF NOVEMBER 8 WE HEREBY BEGIN OUR VOYAGE OF EXPLORATION UNDER THE WATERS MAY GOD BE WITH US I REPLIED
MEANWHILE THE MISTS DIDN'T CLEAR AND BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE SUN STILL HADN'T MADE AN APPEARANCE
CONTENTS COLOR PLATES VII INTRODUCTION IX UNITS OF MEASURE XII FIRST PART 1
IT HAPPENED 638 MILES FROM THE COAST OF IRELAND
ABOVE ME I COULD SEE THE CALM SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
WHAT WAS THE USE OF DEBATING SUCH A PROPOSITION WHEN SUPERIOR FORCE CAN WIPE OUT THE BEST ARGUMENTS
HOWEVER AT 14,000 METERS I SAW BLACKISH PEAKS RISING IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS
WELL SIR NED LAND WENT ON SEEING THAT I HADN'T REPLIED
A FEW HUNDRED FATHOMS AT BEST
HERE ENDED THE DOMAINS OF CAPTAIN NEMO
WATCH OUT HE SAID
HA
THE HYPOTHESIS OF A DRIFTING ISLET OR AN ELUSIVE REEF PUT FORWARD BY PEOPLE NOT QUITE IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS WAS COMPLETELY ELIMINATED
WHICH BEARS OUT YOUR FORMULATION
O SHIP OF AN ACCURSED NATION YOU KNOW WHO I AM HE SHOUTED IN HIS POWERFUL VOICE
THEN I SAW NO MORE OF HIM FOR SOME DAYS AND AGAIN LIVED ON BOARD IN SECLUSION
BUT I'M A HUNTER NOT A BUTCHER AND THIS IS PLAIN BUTCHERY IT WAS A SLAUGHTER OF DESTRUCTIVE ANIMALS THE CAPTAIN REPLIED AND THE NAUTILUS IS NO BUTCHER KNIFE I PREFER MY HARPOON THE CANADIAN ANSWERED
THE SEA WAS DYED RED AND THROUGH THIS OPAQUE LIQUID I COULD SEE NOTHING ELSE
WHEN I WANT TO RISE AGAIN AND LIE FLUSH WITH THE SURFACE ALL I HAVE TO DO IS EXPEL THAT WATER
I CLOSED MY EYES
WITH HIS EVERY MOVEMENT I IMAGINED HE WOULD APPEAR AND ASK ME WHY I WANTED TO ESCAPE
BY 8:30 WE WERE BACK ON BOARD THE NAUTILUS
AS FOR US HALF LAUGHING WE MASSAGED AND COMFORTED POOR NED LAND WHO WAS SWEARING LIKE ONE POSSESSED
I DIDN'T HEAR A SINGLE SOUND INSIDE THIS DEAD-SEEMING BOAT
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED AS COMFORTABLE AS A HERMIT CRAB INSIDE THE SHELL OF A WHELK I LEFT CONSEIL TO THE PROPER STOWING OF OUR LUGGAGE AND CLIMBED ON DECK TO WATCH THE PREPARATIONS FOR GETTING UNDER WAY
THAT WAS INSANITY
NEMO MEANS NO ONE ED
NEMO MEANS NO ONE ED
CARRIED AWAY I DIDN'T FEEL EXHAUSTED ANY MORE
AT CLOSE QUARTERS I REPEATED
IT COMES FROM THE SCALES OF A EUROPEAN CARP IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A SILVER SUBSTANCE THAT COLLECTS IN THE WATER AND IS PRESERVED IN AMMONIA
HURLED ALOFT ICE RUBBLE FELL BACK AROUND US LIKE HAIL
AS FOR THE FIRST SUBGENUS IT FURNISHED SEVERAL SPECIMENS OF THAT BIZARRE FISH APTLY NICKNAMED TOADFISH WHOSE BIG HEAD IS SOMETIMES GOUGED WITH DEEP CAVITIES SOMETIMES SWOLLEN WITH PROTUBERANCES
WE ON THE OTHER HAND DIDN'T HAVE TO PRACTICE SUCH MODERATION
CONSEIL AND I PICKED UP TWO MORE AXES
NOT ONLY HAD HE PLACED HIMSELF BEYOND HUMAN LAWS HE HAD RENDERED HIMSELF INDEPENDENT OUT OF ALL REACH FREE IN THE STRICTEST SENSE OF THE WORD
DURING THIS PART OF OUR VOYAGE WE NAVIGATED ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES FOR ENTIRE DAYS
THIS WAS NO FANTASY
THE TRANSPARENCY OF SALT WATER HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED
IT WAS A HORRIBLE WOUND
WHILE I WAS OBSERVING THIS PHENOMENAL CREATURE TWO JETS OF STEAM AND WATER SPRANG FROM ITS BLOWHOLES AND ROSE TO AN ALTITUDE OF FORTY METERS WHICH SETTLED FOR ME ITS MODE OF BREATHING
BOILING WATER HE MUTTERED
THESE WERE THE YOUNG OYSTERS
THE TORRES STRAIT 103 21
THE ANTARCTIC SEAS SERVE AS A REFUGE FOR AN EXTREMELY LARGE NUMBER OF MIGRATORY FISH THAT FLEE FROM STORMS IN THE SUBPOLAR ZONES IN TRUTH ONLY TO SLIDE DOWN THE GULLETS OF PORPOISES AND SEALS
ACCORDINGLY SEALS ARE QUITE CAPABLE OF BEING EDUCATED
OH DRAT SAID THE OLD GUNNER IN HIS ANGER
FOR CERTAIN I CAME TO QUICKLY BECAUSE SOMEONE WAS MASSAGING ME SO VIGOROUSLY IT LEFT FURROWS IN MY FLESH
THESE FISH FOLLOWED US IN SCHOOLS AND SUPPLIED OUR TABLE WITH VERY DAINTY FLESH
OUR TRAWL BROUGHT UP IN ITS MESHES A NUMBER OF FISH WHOSE HEADS WERE TOPPED BY LITTLE OVAL SLABS WITH FLESHY EDGES
THE FLESH OF THESE TURTLES WAS NOTHING MEMORABLE BUT THEIR EGGS MADE AN EXCELLENT FEAST
AM I DISTURBING YOU I SAID OUT OF POLITENESS
BEHOLD MY GREATEST SOURCE OF IRRITATION--A WALL MASTER IS RIGHT CONSEIL SAID
IT DOES EVERYTHING
THE FIRST CONTAINED THE CELLS FOR GENERATING ELECTRICITY THE SECOND THAT MECHANISM TRANSMITTING MOVEMENT TO THE PROPELLER
NOT ONLY ON THEIR SIZE I REPLIED BUT ALSO ACCORDING TO THEIR SHAPE THEIR WATER--IN OTHER WORDS THEIR COLOR--AND THEIR ORIENT IN OTHER WORDS THAT DAPPLED SHIMMERING GLOW THAT MAKES THEM SO DELIGHTFUL TO THE EYE
IF THESE FINS STAY PARALLEL WITH THE BOAT THE LATTER MOVES HORIZONTALLY
JUST THEN CONSEIL WOKE UP TOGETHER WITH THE NAUTILUS'S SAILOR
PERHAPS SOME ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION HAD INTENSIFIED THIS PHENOMENON
IF YOU DON'T COME BACK FOR SECONDS I'M NO LONGER THE KING OF HARPOONERS AFTER A FEW MINUTES THE PARTS OF THE FRUIT EXPOSED TO THE FIRE WERE COMPLETELY TOASTED
IS HE THE PERSECUTOR OR THE PERSECUTED
IN SILENCE WE WAITED FOR THE OUTCOME OF THIS SCENE
THIS WAILEA OYSTERBANK MUST HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVE AND FOR CERTAIN IF THEY HADN'T BEEN CONTROLLED BY NUMEROUS NATURAL CHECKS THESE CLUSTERS OF SHELLFISH WOULD HAVE ENDED UP JAM-PACKING THE BAY SINCE AS MANY AS 2,000,000 EGGS HAVE BEEN COUNTED IN A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL
JUST THEN MY EYE WAS CAUGHT BY SOME ETCHINGS HANGING ON THE WALL WHICH I HADN'T NOTICED DURING MY FIRST VISIT
THE HATCH OPENED AND WE RUSHED ONTO THE PLATFORM
THIS VALLEY IS CLOSED OFF TO THE EAST BY A SHEER WALL 2,000 METERS HIGH
I'LL LET THE READER DECIDE WHETHER THE CANADIAN'S APPETITE WAS AROUSED BY THE SIGHT OF THIS TASTY GAME AND WHETHER HE REGRETTED HAVING NO RIFLE IN HIS HANDS
IT CONSISTS OF A TANK BUILT FROM HEAVY SHEET IRON IN WHICH I STORE AIR UNDER A PRESSURE OF FIFTY ATMOSPHERES
BUT I WAS DONE WITH THE SHORE THE DAY MY NAUTILUS SUBMERGED FOR THE FIRST TIME UNDER THE WATERS
AND NOW HOW CAN I CONVEY THE IMPRESSIONS LEFT ON ME BY THIS STROLL UNDER THE WATERS
WE PILED HELTER-SKELTER INTO THE THICK OF THESE SAWED-OFF SNAKES WHICH DARTED OVER THE PLATFORM AMID WAVES OF BLOOD AND SEPIA INK
IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING THIS STRANGE MAN HADN'T YET SUCCEEDED IN COMPLETELY STIFLING HIS HEART
AND YOU CAN MINE THESE VEINS OF UNDERWATER COAL YOU'LL WATCH ME WORK THEM PROFESSOR ARONNAX
CHAPTER 17 FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON HOW I GOT ONTO THE PLATFORM I'M UNABLE TO SAY
IN FACT THE NAUTILUS WAS SKIMMING ONLY TEN METERS OVER THE SOIL OF THESE ATLANTIS PLAINS
FOR SOME IT'S A POLYPARY AND FOR OTHERS SUCH AS PROFESSOR MILNE-EDWARDS IT'S A SINGLE SOLITARY INDIVIDUAL
CLINGING TO THE STEMPOST NED LAND THRUST HIS HARPOON AGAIN AND AGAIN INTO THE GIGANTIC ANIMAL WHICH IMBEDDED ITS TEETH IN OUR GUNWALE AND LIFTED THE LONGBOAT OUT OF THE WATER AS A LION WOULD LIFT A DEER
IT'S POORLY CONSTRUCTED BEING DEFECTIVE SO TO SPEAK OVER THE WHOLE LEFT SIDE OF ITS FRAME WITH GOOD EYESIGHT ONLY IN ITS RIGHT EYE
THEN I SAW THAT BEES WEREN'T THE ANIMAL KINGDOM'S ONLY REPRESENTATIVES INSIDE THIS VOLCANO
I MIGHT ADD HE WENT ON THAT I'M AS HANDY WITH A PICK AS A HARPOON
HE DIDN'T MOVE
AT FULL STEAM 24 7
IN THE DOMAIN OF MARINE BIOLOGY HE GIVES US THUMBNAIL SKETCHES OF FISH SEASHELLS CORAL SOMETIMES IN GREAT CATALOGS THAT SWIRL PAST LIKE MUSICAL CASCADES
BUT WE BARELY HAD TIME TO THINK
IF A PROMISING OPPORTUNITY COMES UP WE HAVE TO GRAB IT AGREED
CENTIMETER ROUGHLY 2/5 OF AN INCH
HARPOON IN HAND NED LAND WENT TO TAKE HIS STAND IN THE SKIFF'S BOW
WHAT IS THE CONSTITUTION OF THESE ANIMALS
BUT THIS STUBBORN CANADIAN SPENT EIGHT HOURS OUT OF EVERY TWELVE READING OR SLEEPING IN HIS CABIN
IT WAS THE NAUTILUS'S BEACON
THUS TO THAT QUESTION ASKED 6,000 YEARS AGO IN THE BOOK OF ECCLESIASTES--"WHO CAN FATHOM THE SOUNDLESS DEPTHS TWO MEN OUT OF ALL HUMANITY HAVE NOW EARNED THE RIGHT TO REPLY
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF 8,200 METERS WAS FOUND IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND 2,500 METERS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
THE CANADIAN PROPERLY SKINNED AND CLEANED IT AFTER REMOVING HALF A DOZEN CUTLETS DESTINED TO SERVE AS THE GRILLED MEAT COURSE OF OUR EVENING MEAL
NOT YET
SO AT PRECISELY THIS POINT THE DARKNESS BECAME PROFOUND
LOOK AT THAT ONE MOVE
WHERE DID THIS NEARLY UNLIMITED ENERGY ORIGINATE
THE NAUTILUS TRAVELED SWIFTLY
CONTRIVED IN THE NAUTILUS'S SIDE A SECOND DOOR THEN OPENED
THE NEXT DAY MARCH 21 BRIGHT AND EARLY AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
HELP THIS WAS THE LAST SHOUT I GAVE
AND FINALLY THAT MARTYR FOR THE REDEMPTION OF THE BLACK RACE JOHN BROWN HANGING FROM HIS GALLOWS AS VICTOR HUGO'S PENCIL HAS SO TERRIFYINGLY DEPICTED
IT'S ELECTRIC IT RUNS WITH AN ACCURACY RIVALING THE FINEST CHRONOMETERS
MEASURING THREE METERS THEIR BODIES WERE BLACK ON TOP UNDERNEATH A PINKISH WHITE STREWN WITH SMALL VERY SCATTERED SPOTS
IF THEY DON'T FISH FOR THEM SAILORS AT LEAST SIGHT THEM
MY SPYGLASS FELL FROM HIS HAND AND ROLLED AT HIS FEET
I COULDN'T HELP SMILING
AND WHY SO BECAUSE IN THOSE DAYS THEIR TAILS MOVED SIDE TO SIDE LIKE THOSE ON FISH IN OTHER WORDS THEIR TAILS WERE STRAIGHT UP THRASHING THE WATER FROM LEFT TO RIGHT RIGHT TO LEFT
IT WAS THEIR RELATIVES IN THE TIDAL WAVE ON DECEMBER 23 1854 THAT TOPPLED PART OF THE JAPANESE CITY OF TOKYO THEN WENT THAT SAME DAY AT 700 KILOMETERS PER HOUR TO BREAK ON THE BEACHES OF AMERICA
I ACCEPT THE EXPLANATION BUT IN OUR PERSONAL INTERESTS I'M SORRY THIS OPENING THE PROFESSOR MENTIONS WASN'T MADE ABOVE SEA LEVEL BUT NED MY FRIEND CONSEIL ANSWERED IF IT WEREN'T AN UNDERWATER PASSAGEWAY THE NAUTILUS COULDN'T ENTER IT AND I MIGHT ADD MR LAND I SAID THAT THE WATERS WOULDN'T HAVE RUSHED UNDER THE MOUNTAIN AND THE VOLCANO WOULD STILL BE A VOLCANO
WHICH IS WHY HE SHOULD HAVE CHRISTENED HIS SHIP THE ARGONAUT FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THE NAUTILUS CRUISED IN THE MIDST OF THIS SCHOOL OF MOLLUSKS
HIS FACE ORDINARILY SO EMOTIONLESS WAS STAMPED WITH INDESCRIBABLE ASTONISHMENT
THERE ARE NO STRUCTURAL DEFORMITIES TO WORRY ABOUT BECAUSE THE DOUBLE HULL OF THIS BOAT HAS THE RIGIDITY OF IRON
WE MUST RESCUE HIM AT ALL COST THE CAPTAIN DIDN'T REPLY BUT WENT TO LEAN AGAINST THE WINDOW
HERE HE NO LONGER HAD THE EASE OF MOVEMENT AND FREEDOM OF MANEUVER THAT THE OCEANS ALLOWED HIM AND HIS NAUTILUS FELT CRAMPED SO CLOSE TO THE COASTS OF BOTH AFRICA AND EUROPE
THEN A FEW SECONDS LATER THE WATERS SPLASHED ASTERN OF THE NAUTILUS DISTURBED BY THE FALL OF A HEAVY OBJECT
SPYGLASSES FUNCTIONED WITH FEVERISH ENERGY
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN UNFORESEEN EVENTS MAY FORCE ME TO CONFINE YOU TO YOUR CABINS FOR SOME HOURS OR EVEN FOR SOME DAYS AS THE CASE MAY BE
IT WAS CATCHING ITS BREATH ONLY I'VE NO IDEA WHAT TIME IT IS PROFESSOR ARONNAX UNLESS MAYBE IT'S DINNERTIME DINNERTIME MY FINE HARPOONER
IT SEEMED TO BE SEARCHING FOR A LOCALITY THAT IT HAD SOME TROUBLE FINDING
I THOUGHT IT WOULD FIND CALM AGAIN AT FIFTEEN METERS DOWN
THE FRIGATE SAILED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED
SCHOOLS OF ELEGANT PLAYFUL DOLPHIN SWAM ALONGSIDE FOR ENTIRE DAYS
CHAPTER 18 FOUR THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE PACIFIC BY THE NEXT MORNING NOVEMBER 18 I WAS FULLY RECOVERED FROM MY EXHAUSTION OF THE DAY BEFORE AND I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM JUST AS THE NAUTILUS'S CHIEF OFFICER WAS PRONOUNCING HIS DAILY PHRASE
AMONG THESE VESSELS HOW MANY WENT DOWN WITH ALL HANDS WITH THEIR CREWS AND HOSTS OF IMMIGRANTS AT THESE TROUBLE SPOTS SO PROMINENT IN THE STATISTICS
THE HATCH CLOSED AND I HEARD WATER HISSING IN THE BALLAST TANKS
IN ESSENCE IT WAS PRECISELY MARCH 20
AT WHAT SPOT ON THE CONTINENT
WITHOUT IT NO SIGHTS WERE POSSIBLE
LET SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES COME MR LAND AND WE'LL SEE
LADYFISH THAT CAN FLUTTER THEIR EYELIDS
ITS BODY WAS SPINDLE-SHAPED AND SWOLLEN IN THE MIDDLE A FLESHY MASS THAT MUST HAVE WEIGHED 20,000 TO 25,000 KILOGRAMS
WE HAD THOUGHTS ONLY OF THE FUTURE
IN ESSENCE THE MEDITERRANEAN RECEIVES A CONTINUAL INFLUX OF WATER NOT ONLY FROM THE ATLANTIC BUT FROM RIVERS EMPTYING INTO IT
THE MOON SHONE IN THE MIDST OF THE CONSTELLATIONS AT THEIR ZENITH
IN LATITUDE 47
I OPENED THE DOOR CAUTIOUSLY BUT AS IT SWUNG ON ITS HINGES IT SEEMED TO MAKE A FRIGHTFUL NOISE
THE FINEST PEARLS ARE CALLED VIRGIN PEARLS OR PARAGONS
BUT WHEN THESE GIANT SEALS DEFEND THEIR LITTLE ONES THEIR FURY IS DREADFUL AND IT ISN'T RARE FOR THEM TO SMASH A FISHERMAN'S LONGBOAT TO BITS THEY'RE WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS CONSEIL ANSWERED
IN ESSENCE THIS MOUNTAIN WAS A VOLCANO
THEY WERE THE ACTUAL MILITARY ORDERS GIVEN BY FRANCE'S MINISTER OF THE NAVY TO COMMANDER LA PéROUSE WITH NOTES ALONG THE MARGIN IN THE HANDWRITING OF KING LOUIS XVI
WHAT IS IT I ASKED IN A SITTING POSITION
ABOMINABLE INDEED I REPLIED AND HARDLY SUITABLE FOR A CRAFT LIKE THE NAUTILUS THAT DAMNED CAPTAIN THE CANADIAN WENT ON MUST REALLY BE SURE OF HIS COURSE BECAUSE IF THESE CLUMPS OF CORAL SO MUCH AS BRUSH US THEY'LL RIP OUR HULL INTO A THOUSAND PIECES THE SITUATION WAS INDEED DANGEROUS BUT AS IF BY MAGIC THE NAUTILUS SEEMED TO GLIDE RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THESE RAMPAGING REEFS
THEIR INTENSE BRILLIANCE HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY A REDDISH TWILIGHT A MIDPOINT BETWEEN DAY AND NIGHT
A CONNECTION BETWEEN TWO SEAS
PACKS OR BROKEN TRACTS CALLED PATCHES WHEN THEY'RE CIRCULAR AND STREAMS WHEN THEY FORM LONG STRIPS
FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS CONSEIL HAD GONE WITH ME WHEREVER SCIENCE BECKONED
FINALLY AT NOON WE WERE PLOWING THE WAVES OF THE RED SEA
THEN CHART IN HAND WE RETURNED TO THE DEEDS OF THE FRENCH NAVIGATOR
DID HE WANT TO CHANGE HIS PLANS CONCERNING US
AT 10:50 IN THE EVENING THAT ELECTRIC LIGHT REAPPEARED THREE MILES TO WINDWARD OF THE FRIGATE JUST AS CLEAR AND INTENSE AS THE NIGHT BEFORE
LUNCH IS SERVED INDEED THE TABLE HAD BEEN LAID
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE GIST OF IT I SAID REREADING THE LETTER
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I GATHERED FROM THEIR DIFFERENCES IN TONE AND GESTURE
I MADE MY WAY TO THE LOUNGE
THREE O'CLOCK THEN SOUNDED
BUT REST ASSURED I ADDED THAT BETWEEN PASSENGERS SEAMEN OR OFFICERS WE DON'T TOTAL ONE-TENTH OF THAT FIGURE WHICH IS STILL TOO MANY FOR THREE MEN CONSEIL MUTTERED
AND WITH ITS FLAG NAILED UP ON THE AFTERDECK IT DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE WAVES TO SHOUTS OF LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THIS IS THE AVENGER I EXCLAIMED
THESE WERE EITHER FLYING GURNARDS OR KITELIKE SEA ROBINS WHOSE LIPS GLOWED IN THE DARK AT NIGHT SCRAWLING FIERY STREAKS IN THE AIR BEFORE PLUNGING INTO THE MURKY WATERS LIKE SO MANY SHOOTING STARS
JUST THEN THE CAPTAIN ENTERED THE LOUNGE
STIRRED UP BY OUR FOOTSTEPS THE MICA-RICH DUST ON THIS BEACH FLEW INTO THE AIR LIKE A CLOUD OF SPARKS
FATE HAS SHOWN YOU WHAT YOU WEREN'T MEANT TO SEE
DEXTERITY COOLNESS BRAVERY AND CUNNING WERE VIRTUES HE POSSESSED TO A HIGH DEGREE AND IT TOOK A TRULY CRAFTY BALEEN WHALE OR AN EXCEPTIONALLY ASTUTE SPERM WHALE TO ELUDE THE THRUSTS OF HIS HARPOON
WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I WAS WELLNIGH ASPHYXIATED BY THE CARBON DIOXIDE SATURATING THE AIR
A LUMINOUS CEILING DECORATED WITH DELICATE ARABESQUES DISTRIBUTED A SOFT CLEAR DAYLIGHT OVER ALL THE WONDERS GATHERED IN THIS MUSEUM
LET'S SHAKE HANDS AND MAY GOD BE WITH US NED LAND WAS DETERMINED CONSEIL CALM I MYSELF NERVOUS AND BARELY IN CONTROL
SIX OF THEIR EIGHT TENTACLES WERE LONG THIN AND FLOATED ON THE WATER WHILE THE OTHER TWO WERE ROUNDED INTO PALMS AND SPREAD TO THE WIND LIKE LIGHT SAILS
WE HAD CROSSED THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN AND THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN OPENED LESS THAN 700 MILES TO THE SOUTH
THERE BETWEEN ITS LEAFLIKE FOLDS I SAW A LOOSE PEARL AS BIG AS A COCONUT
SUBMERGED SOME FATHOMS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE WATER THE MONSTER GAVE OFF THAT VERY INTENSE BUT INEXPLICABLE GLOW THAT SEVERAL CAPTAINS HAD MENTIONED IN THEIR REPORTS
SO THAT ANIMAL IS FASTER THAN THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
HOW COULD I HIDE THE INVOLUNTARY HORROR HE INSPIRED IN ME
THE LAST SURVIVING MAN ON THE NAUTILUS WILL THROW THIS CONTRIVANCE INTO THE SEA AND IT WILL GO WHEREVER THE WAVES CARRY IT THE MAN'S NAME
AND I AGREE THAT THERE ARE HONORABLE CANNIBALS WHO DECENTLY DEVOUR THEIR PRISONERS
DON'T YOUR MOUNTAINEERS ATTACK BEARS DAGGER IN HAND
INSTANTLY ONE OF THOSE LONG ARMS GLIDED LIKE A SNAKE INTO THE OPENING AND TWENTY OTHERS WERE QUIVERING ABOVE
I WAS IN DREAD THE LATTER WOULD GIVE WAY TO SOME VIOLENT OUTBURST THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD DEPLORABLE CONSEQUENCES
NOW THEN IF WATER ISN'T ABSOLUTELY INCOMPRESSIBLE AT LEAST IT COMPRESSES VERY LITTLE
STILL FARTHER OFF LONG ROWS OF COLLAPSING WALLS DESERTED THOROUGHFARES A WHOLE POMPEII BURIED UNDER THE WATERS WHICH CAPTAIN NEMO HAD RESURRECTED BEFORE MY EYES
IN CERTAIN LOCALITIES THIN SMOKE HOLES GAVE OFF A SULFUROUS ODOR SHOWING THAT THE INNER FIRES STILL KEPT THEIR WIDE-RANGING POWER
I THEN DID CONSEIL THE SAME FAVOR AND WE CONTINUED TO NAVIGATE SIDE BY SIDE
HUGE CLOUDS COVERED THE MOON'S DISK THEN IN ITS FIRST QUARTER
WHO COULD REACH YOU IN THE HEART OF A VOLCANO
MY MIND WAS IN A TOTAL DAZE
IF I CAN BE HELPFUL TO THE CAPTAIN HE CAN USE ME ANY WAY HE WANTS HE WON'T TURN DOWN YOUR ASSISTANCE
ON APRIL 16 WE RAISED MARTINIQUE AND GUADALUPE FROM A DISTANCE OF ABOUT THIRTY MILES
I SAW THE FIGHT ENTER A NEW PHASE
YES I MUTTERED WE KNOW HOW TO DIE THE CANADIAN PAUSED IN HIS WORK
AT NOON THE SUN MADE A MOMENTARY APPEARANCE
THEN THE FUNERAL PARTY WENT BACK UP THE PATH TO THE NAUTILUS RETURNING BENEATH THE ARCHES OF THE FOREST THROUGH THE THICKETS ALONG THE CORAL BUSHES GOING STEADILY HIGHER
SO IT WAS GATHERING MOMENTUM
HENCE A TIMELY WARNING TO THOSE INVESTORS WOULD BE AN ACT OF CHARITY
CERTAIN OF THIS FACT I WONDERED IF THERE WEREN'T A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO SEAS
ANYHOW HE SAID IT'S NOT OVER YET
QUITE NATURALLY I LED OUR CONVERSATION AROUND TO THE GIANT UNICORN AND I WEIGHED OUR EXPEDITION'S VARIOUS CHANCES FOR SUCCESS OR FAILURE
ALTHOUGH THE LOUNGE WAS HERMETICALLY SEALED IT WAS FILLING WITH AN INTOLERABLE STINK OF SULFUR AND I COULD SEE SCARLET FLAMES OF SUCH BRIGHTNESS THEY OVERPOWERED OUR ELECTRIC LIGHT
AFTER SUPPER WAS SERVED ME BY THE MUTE AND EMOTIONLESS STEWARD I FELL ASLEEP
AFTER THE GALLEY CAME THE CREW'S QUARTERS 5 METERS LONG
I SHOWED CONSEIL THE POSITION OF THIS LONG REEF ON OUR CHART OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
BONY FISH ARE SUBDIVIDED INTO SIX ORDERS
EARLY ON IT WAS VARIOUSLY CALLED VOYAGE UNDER THE WATERS TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE WATERS TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE WATERS AND A THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE OCEANS
DIVING EASILY THESE REPTILES CAN REMAIN A GOOD WHILE UNDERWATER BY CLOSING THE FLESHY VALVES LOCATED AT THE EXTERNAL OPENINGS OF THEIR NASAL PASSAGES
I WENT BELOW TO THE LOUNGE FROM WHICH SOME CHORDS WERE WAFTING
I DON'T SAY NAY BUT TO MY REGRET THESE CROAKERS DIDN'T SERENADE US AS WE PASSED
NOTHING RELATIVELY SPEAKING SINCE SO FAR WE'VE COVERED ONLY 6,000 LEAGUES ACROSS THE PACIFIC
IS HE STILL UNDER THE OCEAN PURSUING HIS FRIGHTFUL PROGRAM OF REVENGE OR DID HE STOP AFTER THAT LATEST MASS EXECUTION
WE MUST HOLD IT IN CHECK
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT MY HEAVY LEAD SOLES WERE CRUSHING A LITTER OF BONES THAT MADE A DRY CRACKLING NOISE
I GLIMPSED PILES OF STONES COVERED BY A COUPLE MILLION ZOOPHYTES AND TANGLES OF ALGAE
I UNDERSTOOD THIS MANEUVER
BUT AS BEAUTIFUL AS IT WAS I COULD GET ONLY A QUICK LOOK AT THIS BASIN WHOSE SURFACE AREA COMPRISES 2,000,000 SQUARE KILOMETERS
I COULDN'T HOLD STILL
WERE THIS SHIP AND EVERYONE ON BOARD DOOMED TO PERISH IN THIS TOMB OF ICE
WE WERE IN DREAD IN THE LAST STAGES OF SHEER HORROR OUR BLOOD FROZEN IN OUR VEINS OUR NERVES NUMB DRENCHED IN COLD SWEAT AS IF FROM THE THROES OF DYING
SOME OF THESE TINY CREATURES STICK TOGETHER OVER AN AREA OF SEVERAL LEAGUES SEVERAL LEAGUES CONSEIL EXCLAIMED
AFTER OUR POSITION FIX THE NAUTILUS'S LATITUDE BEARINGS WERE MODULATED TO THE SOUTHWEST
BUT THE SEA REMAINED SMOOTH AND EASILY VISIBLE OVER A VAST PERIMETER
BESIDES HOW COULD THE ASSEMBLY OF THIS UNDERWATER BOAT HAVE ESCAPED PUBLIC NOTICE
IN 1820 THE ENGLISHMAN BRANSFIELD STOPPED AT 65 DEGREES
HELP THESE WORDS PRONOUNCED IN FRENCH LEFT ME DEEPLY STUNNED
C
C
NEITHER THE MECHANICS OR THE CREWMEN WILL BE ABLE TO SEE US
DO YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF SPAIN VERY LITTLE OF IT I REPLIED
YOU'VE TAKEN YOUR STUDIES AS FAR AS TERRESTRIAL SCIENCE CAN GO
ON THE INSIDE THERE APPEARED SOME WHITE PASTA A SORT OF SOFT BREAD CENTER WHOSE FLAVOR REMINDED ME OF ARTICHOKE
YOU'RE AN ENGINEER THEN CAPTAIN NEMO YES PROFESSOR HE ANSWERED ME
THEY WERE EXAMINING THE SHIP'S CIRCUMSTANCES EXCHANGING A FEW WORDS IN THEIR INCOMPREHENSIBLE DIALECT
FARTHER ON THE BOTTOM WAS TINTED WITH FINE SHADES OF ULTRAMARINE
I'M UNABLE TO
THEIR CAPTAINS AND PASSENGERS NO LONGER PREPARE FOR DEPARTURE WITH SACRIFICES TO PLACATE THE GODS AND AFTER RETURNING THEY DON'T TRAIPSE IN WREATHS AND GOLD RIBBONS TO SAY THANKS AT THE LOCAL TEMPLE AGREED I SAID
NEVER WAS HOSPITALITY MORE WHOLEHEARTED THAN HIS
BUT THE CAPTAIN STOPPED ME SIGNALED NO REMOVED HIS DAGGER IN ONE SWIFT MOTION AND LET THE TWO VALVES SNAP SHUT
YES MY BOY AND DON'T EVEN TRY TO COMPUTE THE NUMBER OF THESE INFUSORIA
A JOLT MADE IT TREMBLE THROUGH ITS ENTIRE FRAMEWORK
AND IN THIS VEIN THE HONORABLE PIERRE ARONNAX PROFESSOR AT THE PARIS MUSEUM WAS SUMMONED BY THE NEW YORK HERALD TO FORMULATE HIS VIEWS NO MATTER WHAT
UNDER THE BRILLIANT LIGHTING OF THE NAUTILUS'S RAYS I COULD MAKE OUT HER FEATURES WHICH THE WATER HADN'T YET DECOMPOSED
OUR APPETITES APPEASED WE FELT AN URGENT NEED FOR SLEEP
THERE ALSO WERE OTHER PECULIARITIES I COULDN'T MAKE SENSE OF
WHEN I HAD ABSORBED A CHESTFUL OF THIS CLEAN AIR I LOOKED FOR THE CONDUIT--THE AIR CARRIER IF YOU PREFER--THAT ALLOWED THIS BENEFICIAL INFLUX TO REACH US AND I SOON FOUND IT
AND ONCE IT CONTAINS NO MORE THAN 15 OXYGEN IT BECOMES UNFIT FOR BREATHING SURELY BUT AS I TOLD YOU PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE NAUTILUS'S PUMPS ENABLE ME TO STORE AIR UNDER CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE AND GIVEN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THE TANK ON MY DIVING EQUIPMENT CAN SUPPLY BREATHABLE AIR FOR NINE OR TEN HOURS I'VE NO MORE OBJECTIONS TO RAISE I REPLIED
GIVES US THE QUOTIENT OF 625
THESE WERE SEALS OF VARIOUS SPECIES SOME STRETCHED OUT ON THE GROUND OTHERS LYING ON DRIFTING ICE FLOES SEVERAL LEAVING OR REENTERING THE SEA
THEN THE SEA GREW TURBULENT WE WENT BELOW AGAIN AND THE HATCH CLOSED ONCE MORE
THIS DEMANDS A STRENGTH THAT ELECTRICITY ALONE CAN GIVE ME CAPTAIN NEMO SAID SWIFTLY
ONE AND A HALF METERS LONG THIS OTTER HAD TO BE WORTH A GOOD HIGH PRICE
NATIVE DUGOUT CANOES ARE SURROUNDING US AND IN A FEW MINUTES WE'RE SURE TO BE ASSAULTED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED SAVAGES AH CAPTAIN NEMO PUT IN SERENELY
IN ORDER TO KEEP US CAPTIVE HE HAD COUNTED ONLY ON THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOT ON OUR WORD OF HONOR
FREE OF ALL MIST THE HORIZON WAS IDEAL FOR TAKING SIGHTS
IT WAS A HUMAN ANTHILL THAT AN INVADING SEA HAD CAUGHT BY SURPRISE
MY BLOOD TURNED COLD IN MY VEINS
I WAS ABOUT TO OPEN IT WHEN A GASP FROM CAPTAIN NEMO NAILED ME TO THE SPOT
ON JANUARY 17 1773 THE FAMOUS CAPTAIN COOK WENT ALONG THE 38TH MERIDIAN ARRIVING AT LATITUDE 67 DEGREES 30
SO EVERYTHING'S READY
BESIDES ON THIS WELL-CHOSEN PLATEAU THE CABLE NEVER LIES AT DEPTHS THAT COULD CAUSE A BREAK
THIS DARING AND POWERFUL MAN COULDN'T CONTROL THE SUN AS HE DID THE SEA
THERE A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE FRIGATE A LONG BLACKISH BODY EMERGED A METER ABOVE THE WAVES
THESE ANIMALS WERE SMALL IN STATURE
I LOOKED AT THE PRESSURE GAUGE
THEY WERE WOLFING DOWN THEIR FOOD AND WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I DID THE SAME
THIS DESCRIPTION IS BASED MOSTLY ON CERTAIN HAND-DRAWN CHARTS KEPT IN THE NAUTILUS'S LIBRARY CHARTS OBVIOUSLY RENDERED BY CAPTAIN NEMO HIMSELF FROM HIS OWN PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS
BUT SUCH WAS THE COMMANDER'S AUTHORITY ABOARD HIS VESSEL NOT ONE GESTURE GAVE AWAY THE RESENTMENT THAT THIS MAN MUST HAVE FELT TOWARD THE CANADIAN
THE NAUTILUS SLOWED DOWN HOVERING ABOVE THE MUDDLED MASSES ON THE SEAFLOOR SOMETIMES GRAZING THEM AS IF WANTING TO COME TO REST SOMETIMES RISING UNPREDICTABLY TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
BUT IT'S OFF CEYLON THAT SUCH FISHING REAPS ITS RICHEST REWARDS
HE WAS MEDITATING OUT LOUD
III NED LAND STAYED AT HIS POST
THIS NOTWITHSTANDING VERNE FURNISHES THE MOST EVOCATIVE PORTRAYAL OF THE OCEAN DEPTHS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF JACQUES COUSTEAU AND TECHNICOLOR FILM
WHAT IS IT CONSEIL IT'S SOMETHING THAT MASTER SHOULD SEE I STOOD UP WENT LEANED ON MY ELBOWS BEFORE THE WINDOW AND I SAW IT
CICERO WOULD HAVE PLUGGED HIS EARS AND SENT ME TO THE SCULLERY BUT SOMEHOW I MANAGED TO PULL THROUGH
I PLUNGED ON SCALING ROCKS STRADDLING FALLEN TREE TRUNKS SNAPPING MARINE CREEPERS THAT SWAYED FROM ONE TREE TO ANOTHER STARTLING THE FISH THAT FLITTED FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH
THE NAUTILUS WAS STATIONARY
BUT WILL THIS OPPORTUNITY EVER ARISE
WHY YES CERTAINLY OF COURSE
THEIR VOLUME AND POWER INCREASED WITH THE DEPTH OF THE WATERS
HE WAS NEVER WRONG WHEN HE OBSERVED SLENDER THREADS OF BLUISH WATER STREAKING THROUGH THESE ICE FIELDS
SIRR ESQ
THE NATIVES ADOPTING A SYSTEM OF DENIAL AND EVASION REFUSED TO GUIDE THEM TO THE SITE OF THE CASUALTY
STROLLING THE PLAINS 82 17
HERE IT IS CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED SHOWING ME A CHART OF THE GREEK ISLANDS
AT HIS SIGNAL THE CHIEF OFFICER APPEARED
MY COMPANIONS WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME SYMPTOMS
THIS BROUGHT IT ABREAST OF ST JOHN'S IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND HEART'S CONTENT WHERE THE ATLANTIC CABLE REACHES ITS END POINT
AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT THIRTY METERS THE NATURE OF THE TERRAIN CHANGED WITHOUT BECOMING ANY EASIER
THE SUBTITLE OF THE PRESENT BOOK IS AN UNDERWATER TOUR OF THE WORLD SO IN GOOD TRAVELOG STYLE THE NAUTILUS'S EXPLOITS SUPPLY AN EPISODIC STORY LINE
BUT I DIDN'T SEE A THING NOT EVEN PERIM ISLAND WHERE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT BUILT FORTIFICATIONS TO STRENGTHEN ADEN'S POSITION
CHAPTER 4 NED LAND COMMANDER FARRAGUT WAS A GOOD SEAMAN WORTHY OF THE FRIGATE HE COMMANDED
AND MUST IT BE SAID IT MUST BE SAID CONSEIL WELL THEN IT WILL SERVE MASTER RIGHT HOW TRUE WHEN ONE HAS THE HONOR OF BEING AN EXPERT AS MASTER IS ONE MUSTN'T LAY HIMSELF OPEN TO CONSEIL DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO COMPLETE THE COMPLIMENT
AND WHAT THINKS OUR FRIEND CONSEIL NED LAND ASKED
TO OUR RIGHT AND LEFT THERE WERE CARVED GLOOMY GALLERIES WHERE THE EYE LOST ITS WAY
YET THIS ISN'T THE CASE AND WE'RE NATURALLY FORCED TO BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF SOME LOWER CURRENT THAT CARRIES THE MEDITERRANEAN'S SURPLUS THROUGH THE STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR AND INTO THE ATLANTIC BASIN
AT FIRST THE LATTER SHOWED LITTLE CONCERN AT THE SIGHT OF THIS NEW MONSTER MEDDLING IN THE BATTLE
APES MAYBE NED LAND EXCLAIMED
NONE AT ALL MY FRIENDS AT LEAST IN THOSE THAT GO BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF CREDIBILITY AND FLY OFF INTO FABLE OR LEGEND
I FELT LIKE I WAS LYING IN THE JAWS OF A FEARSOME MONSTER JAWS IRRESISTIBLY CLOSING
BESIDES THE SEASON WAS ALREADY QUITE ADVANCED SINCE MARCH 13 ON ANTARCTIC SHORES CORRESPONDS WITH SEPTEMBER 13 IN THE NORTHERNMOST REGIONS WHICH MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE EQUINOCTIAL PERIOD
ENORMOUS SIDES OF BACON WERE TRAILED IN OUR WAKE TO THE GREAT SATISFACTION I MUST SAY OF ASSORTED SHARKS
INDEED DESPITE ITS EFFORTS DESPITE THE POWERFUL METHODS IT USED TO SPLIT THIS ICE THE NAUTILUS WAS REDUCED TO IMMOBILITY
THE NEEDLE ON THE PRESSURE GAUGE SWERVED OVER ITS DIAL
THE MOON THEN PASSED ITS ZENITH
YOUR CAPTAIN NEMO--THE DEVIL TAKE HIM--HAS JUST MADE US A VERY PLEASANT PROPOSITION OH I SAID YOU KNOW ABOUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER HAS INVITED US TOGETHER WITH MASTER FOR A VISIT TOMORROW TO CEYLON'S MAGNIFICENT PEARL FISHERIES
HERE AS IN THE LOUNGE I ALWAYS HAVE THEM BEFORE MY EYES AND THEY INDICATE MY POSITION AND EXACT HEADING IN THE MIDST OF THE OCEAN
THE RAIN WAS FOLLOWED BY A DOWNPOUR OF FIRE
THE LENGTH OF THIS CYLINDER FROM END TO END IS EXACTLY SEVENTY METERS AND ITS MAXIMUM BREADTH OF BEAM IS EIGHT METERS
ITS WOUND HADN'T WEAKENED IT BECAUSE IT WENT WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED
CAPTAIN NEMO STOOD UP FROM HIS THWART AND STUDIED THE SEA
HOWEVER I'M OPPOSED TO BEING DEVOURED EVEN IN ALL DECENCY SO I'LL KEEP ON MY GUARD ESPECIALLY SINCE THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER SEEMS TO BE TAKING NO PRECAUTIONS
THERE I OWN VAST PROPERTIES THAT I HARVEST MYSELF AND WHICH ARE FOREVER SOWN BY THE HAND OF THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS I STARED AT CAPTAIN NEMO IN DEFINITE ASTONISHMENT AND I ANSWERED HIM
HE TREMBLED AND TURNING AROUND
AMID THESE SHRUBS OF PRECIOUS CORAL I OBSERVED OTHER POLYPS NO LESS UNUSUAL
ONE SPERM WHALE EXTERMINATED IT RAN AT ANOTHER TACKED ON THE SPOT SO AS NOT TO MISS ITS PREY WENT AHEAD OR ASTERN OBEYED ITS RUDDER DIVED WHEN THE CETACEAN SANK TO DEEPER STRATA ROSE WITH IT WHEN IT RETURNED TO THE SURFACE STRUCK IT HEAD-ON OR SLANTWISE HACKED AT IT OR TORE IT AND FROM EVERY DIRECTION AND AT ANY SPEED SKEWERED IT WITH ITS DREADFUL SPUR
THEY'RE SOUTHERN RIGHT WHALES HE SAID
MOREOVER THE PANELS OPENED JUST THEN AND THE OUTSIDE LIGHT BURST THROUGH THE UNCOVERED WINDOWS
BUT THINK IT OVER BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HIDE ANYTHING FROM YOU
BUT THAT ISN'T THE CASE AND IN ALL HONESTY I DON'T THINK CAPTAIN NEMO EVER VENTURES INTO EUROPEAN SEAS THIS SHORT DIALOGUE REVEALS THAT IN MY MANIA FOR THE NAUTILUS I WAS TURNING INTO THE SPITTING IMAGE OF ITS COMMANDER
BUT I WHOLEHEARTEDLY APPROVED OF THE NAUTILUS'S ENTERING IT
CONSEIL COULDN'T BELIEVE HIS EYES AND HE QUESTIONED ME ABOUT THE CAUSES OF THIS ODD PHENOMENON
FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR I TROD THIS BLAZING SAND WHICH WAS STREWN WITH TINY CRUMBS OF SEASHELL
IN THESE RUINS YOU COULD STILL DETECT THE SOLID PROPORTIONS OF A SORT OF TUSCAN ARCHITECTURE
I SOON REALIZED THE CAUSE
THE SEA WAS NEARLY DESERTED
BUT THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE OF SHARKS TO ASSIST THEM WITH THEIR UNDERTAKING CHORES
I HAD TO REST CONTENT WITH THE VARIOUS SPECIMENS OF FISH BROUGHT UP BY OUR NETS
BUT THE CANADIAN DIDN'T FAIL TO THROW HIS DRAM OF COLD WATER OVER US
BUT WHATEVER RESISTANCE TO CRUSHING THE NAUTILUS MAY HAVE IT STILL COULDN'T STAND SUCH DREADFUL PRESSURES AND IT WOULD BE SQUASHED AS FLAT AS A PIECE OF SHEET IRON I KNOW IT SIR
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I WAS GLAD TO OBLIGE AND WE STRETCHED OUT BENEATH AN ARBOR OF WINGED KELP WHOSE LONG THIN TENDRILS STOOD UP LIKE ARROWS
IN THE PRESENT WORK NEMO'S BACKGROUND REMAINS A DARK SECRET
BUT YOU CAN CONSUME THEM WITHOUT FEAR
BEFORE DIGGING INTO THE ICE THE CAPTAIN HAD TO OBTAIN BORINGS TO INSURE WORKING IN THE BEST DIRECTION
NOW ALLOW ME TO FINISH WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU
HE CAME WONDERFULLY TO TERMS WITH ITS ENTIRE COOKING
ISN'T IT NED OH DAMNATION YES NED LAND SHOT BACK
LOST IN A HEAVY SLEEP OF WHICH THEY HAD NO MEMORY THEY WERE QUITE STARTLED TO BE BACK IN THEIR CABIN
126 YEARS LATER A TIME COVER STORY ON DEEP-SEA EXPLORATION MADE MUCH THE SAME ADMISSION
IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE ASTRONOMER HANSTEEN THIS MAGNETIC POLE IS LOCATED FAIRLY CLOSE TO LATITUDE 70 DEGREES AND LONGITUDE 130 DEGREES OR ABIDING BY THE OBSERVATIONS OF LOUIS-ISIDORE DUPERREY IN LONGITUDE 135 DEGREES AND LATITUDE 70 DEGREES 30 HENCE WE HAD TO TRANSPORT COMPASSES TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SHIP TAKE MANY READINGS AND STRIKE AN AVERAGE
CONSEIL HARVEST SOME OF THIS FRUIT TO TAKE WITH US WHEN WE GO BACK AND HOW WILL YOU PREPARE IT I ASKED THE CANADIAN
CAPTAIN NEMO CALLED OUT
IT WAS CRUISING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES AT A MODERATE SPEED
ITS PADDLE WHEELS WERE CHURNING THE SEA WITH PERFECT STEADINESS
BUT CONSEIL BEING VERY POSSESSIVE OF HIS FISH RUSHED AT IT AND BEFORE I COULD STOP HIM HE SEIZED IT WITH BOTH HANDS
IT WOULD COME ABOUT THEN THAT IN THE PROCESS OF PRODUCING YOUR SODIUM YOU'D USE UP MORE THAN YOU'D MAKE ACCORDINGLY PROFESSOR I DON'T EXTRACT IT WITH BATTERIES
BUT THAT DAY IT WAS REPLACED BY A DIFFERENT PHRASE JUST AS INCOMPREHENSIBLE
AFTER A POSITION FIX TRUE TO HIS PROMISE COMMANDER FARRAGUT WOULD HAVE TO SET HIS COURSE FOR THE SOUTHEAST AND LEAVE THE NORTHERLY REGIONS OF THE PACIFIC DECISIVELY BEHIND
UNTIL TOMORROW THE CAPTAIN SAID SIMPLY
EQUIPPED WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS HE LIT A FIRE OF DEADWOOD THAT WAS SOON CRACKLING MERRILY
POOR SOULS WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM LONG STARVATION MUSTN'T POUNCE HEEDLESSLY ON THE FIRST FOOD GIVEN THEM
ITS INVISIBLE DOOR MUST HAVE BEEN HERMETICALLY SEALED
AMONG THE GREAT WIND RIDERS--CARRIED OVER LONG DISTANCES FROM EVERY SHORE AND RESTING ON THE WAVES FROM THEIR EXHAUSTING FLIGHTS I SPOTTED SOME MAGNIFICENT ALBATROSS BIRDS BELONGING TO THE LONGIPENNES LONG-WINGED FAMILY WHOSE DISCORDANT CALLS SOUND LIKE THE BRAYING OF AN ASS
APPARENTLY THE UNICORN HAD GOTTEN WISE TO THESE PLOTS BEING WOVEN AROUND IT
THE NAUTILUS HAD GONE A FEW MORE MILES DURING THE NIGHT
IT RAN LIKE THIS
IN A CLASS BY ITSELF ED
IN A CLASS BY ITSELF ED
BUT BETWEEN THESE LAVA FLOWS I SPOTTED LITTLE VIOLETS THAT STILL GAVE OFF A SUBTLE FRAGRANCE AND I CONFESS THAT I INHALED IT WITH DELIGHT
SEATED ON THE LEDGE FURNISHED BY THE HULL OF THE SKIFF I INHALED THE SEA'S SALTY AROMA WITH GREAT PLEASURE
SO I HAD A PERFECTLY NATURAL EXPLANATION FOR WHY DESPITE THE BEST SPYGLASSES THIS BOAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN MISTAKEN FOR A MARINE ANIMAL
SINCE THAT NIGHT WHEN THE SKIFF HAD LEFT THE NAUTILUS ON SOME MYSTERIOUS MISSION MY IDEAS ABOUT HIM HAD SUBTLY CHANGED
WE'RE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
BUT ALL EARTHLY THINGS COME TO AN END ALL THINGS MUST PASS EVEN THE HUNGER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T EATEN FOR FIFTEEN HOURS
QUITE SIMPLY I UTILIZE THE HEAT OF COAL FROM THE EARTH FROM THE EARTH I SAID MY VOICE GOING UP ON THE WORD
I ASSUMED THAT THE CREW WERE BUSY WITH INTERIOR REPAIRS REQUIRED BY THE ENGINE'S STRENUOUS MECHANICAL ACTION
I'LL GIVE ORDERS TO MAKE FOR THE GULF OF MANNAR AND WE'LL ARRIVE THERE LATE TONIGHT THE CAPTAIN SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIS CHIEF OFFICER WHO WENT OUT IMMEDIATELY
WOULD WE EMERGE INTO THE OPEN AND FIND THE POLAR AIR AGAIN
I'M READY TO DO ANYTHING I CAN FOR THE COMMON GOOD EXCELLENT NED I SAID EXTENDING MY HAND TO THE CANADIAN
VENTILATORS SHOT TORRENTS OF AIR OVER THE BRAZIERS
ARE WE AT THE POLE I ASKED THE CAPTAIN MY HEART POUNDING
LET'S GO BACK UP PROFESSOR
I SLIPPED COPPER RINGS AROUND THEIR TAILS AND TOSSED THEM BACK INTO THE SEA
OUR WONDERMENT STAYED AT AN ALL-TIME FEVER PITCH
WHAT WOULD CONSEIL SAY
THEN IT WILL BE TIME TO RESUME NED LAND'S PLANS THE CANADIAN SHOOK HIS HEAD PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS BROW MADE NO REPLY AND LEFT US
WHETHER IT WAS ENGLISH FRENCH AMERICAN OR RUSSIAN IT WOULD SURELY WELCOME US ABOARD IF WE COULD JUST GET TO IT
HAD THE NAUTILUS LEFT THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
SEEMINGLY ALL SUPERVISION HAD BEEN JETTISONED
OUR QUICK TRIP THROUGH THE MEDITERRANEAN HADN'T ALLOWED HIM TO PUT HIS PLANS INTO EXECUTION AND HE COULD BARELY CONCEAL HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
I'VE ALERTED CONSEIL
FOR A FARE OF TWENTY FRANCS THE VEHICLE WENT DOWN BROADWAY TO UNION SQUARE TOOK FOURTH AVE TO ITS JUNCTION WITH BOWERY ST TURNED INTO KATRIN ST AND HALTED AT PIER 34
THAT DAY HOWEVER A DEVELOPMENT OCCURRED THAT REMINDED HIM OF HIS HAPPY YEARS AS A HARPOONER
AND THAT'S ALL OF EM YES MY GALLANT NED CONSEIL REPLIED
HE PRESSED A METAL BUTTON AND AT ONCE THE PROPELLER SLOWED DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY
MAN USES HIS RIGHT HAND MORE OFTEN THAN HIS LEFT AND CONSEQUENTLY HIS VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS AND EQUIPMENT STAIRCASES LOCKS WATCH SPRINGS ETC ARE DESIGNED TO BE USED IN A RIGHT-TO-LEFT MANNER
IT WAS THEN ABANDONED AND COVERED WITH SAND SUBSEQUENTLY REINSTATED BY ARABIA'S CALIPH OMAR I AND FINALLY FILLED IN FOR GOOD IN 761 OR 762 A.D
SPLENDID NURSERYFISH ON WHICH NATURE HAS LAVISHED YELLOW AZURE SILVER AND GOLD
I MADE MY WAY TO THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY WHICH LED TO THE PLATFORM
BEFORE A FEW DAYS ARE OUT I FIGURE THE NAUTILUS WILL LIE ABREAST OF NOVA SCOTIA AND FROM THERE TO NEWFOUNDLAND IS THE MOUTH OF A LARGE GULF AND THE ST LAWRENCE EMPTIES INTO THAT GULF AND THE ST LAWRENCE IS MY OWN RIVER THE RIVER RUNNING BY QUEBEC MY HOMETOWN AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT ALL THIS MY GORGE RISES AND MY HAIR STANDS ON END
THE ISLAND OF CEYLON HE SAID IS FAMOUS FOR ITS PEARL FISHERIES
I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO WAKE UP
THE NEXT DAY JUNE 1 THE NAUTILUS KEPT TO THE SAME TACK
SIR I REPEAT
THERE WERE AMERICAN TRIGGERFISH FOR WHICH NATURE HAS GROUND ONLY BLACK AND WHITE PIGMENTS FEATHER-SHAPED GOBIES THAT WERE LONG AND PLUMP WITH YELLOW FINS AND JUTTING JAWS SIXTEEN-DECIMETER MACKEREL WITH SHORT SHARP TEETH COVERED WITH SMALL SCALES AND RELATED TO THE ALBACORE SPECIES
THERE MUST BE SOUTHERN BLOOD IN THEM
AS FOR THE FAMILY IN WHICH IT WOULD BE PLACED BALEEN WHALE SPERM WHALE OR DOLPHIN THE GENUS TO WHICH IT BELONGED AND THE SPECIES IN WHICH IT WOULD FIND ITS PROPER HOME THESE QUESTIONS HAD TO BE LEFT FOR LATER
IN THE BROAD ELECTRIC DAYLIGHT AN ENORMOUS BLACK MASS QUITE MOTIONLESS HUNG SUSPENDED IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS
ON SEPTEMBER 5 1781 UNDER THE COUNT DE GRASSE IT TOOK PART IN THE BATTLE OF CHESAPEAKE BAY
AND YOUR VALVES ARE CHARGED TO TO SIX AND A HALF ATMOSPHERES CHARGE THEM TO TEN ATMOSPHERES A TYPICAL AMERICAN ORDER IF I EVER HEARD ONE
I FELT NED LAND SLIDING A DAGGER INTO MY HAND
I FINISHED HARNESSING MYSELF I FELT AN ALPENSTOCK BEING PLACED IN MY HAND AND A FEW MINUTES LATER AFTER THE USUAL PROCEDURES WE SET FOOT ON THE FLOOR OF THE ATLANTIC 300 METERS DOWN
THERE'S ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE AS FOR NED LAND HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD BUT HIS WIDE-OPEN JAWS WOULD HAVE SCARED OFF A SHARK
THEY SANG ABOUT IT IN THE COFFEE HOUSES THEY RIDICULED IT IN THE NEWSPAPERS THEY DRAMATIZED IT IN THE THEATERS
THE SECOND STRANGER DESERVES A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION
THE SEA IS THE BE ALL AND END ALL
AND WHAT A NOISE AROUND OUR FRAIL SKIFF
THE NAUTILUS STAYED ON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
AFTER GIVING THE CANADIAN A GLIMPSE OF AMERICAN SHORES WAS HE ABOUT TO SHOW ME THE COAST OF FRANCE
THEN THEY ALL APPROACHED THE GRAVE SANK AGAIN ON BENDED KNEE AND EXTENDED THEIR HANDS IN A SIGN OF FINAL FAREWELL
BRANDISHING ITS VICTIM LIKE A FEATHER ONE LONE TENTACLE WAS WRITHING IN THE AIR
SOON JIDDA FADED INTO THE SHADOWS OF EVENING AND THE NAUTILUS WENT BACK BENEATH THE MILDLY PHOSPHORESCENT WATERS
SO I HAD GOTTEN USED TO THE SIGHT OF THIS FASCINATING FISHING WHEN ALL AT ONCE JUST AS THE INDIAN WAS KNEELING ON THE SEAFLOOR I SAW HIM MAKE A FRIGHTENED GESTURE STAND AND GATHER HIMSELF TO SPRING BACK TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
WHILE THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN HEAVED TO ITS LONGBOATS RADIATED IN EVERY DIRECTION AROUND IT AND DIDN'T LEAVE A SINGLE POINT OF THE SEA UNEXPLORED
CONSEIL KEPT ESPECIALLY BUSY OBSERVING MOLLUSKS AND ARTICULATES AND ALTHOUGH HIS CATALOG IS A LITTLE DRY I WOULDN'T WANT TO WRONG THE GALLANT LAD BY LEAVING OUT HIS PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS
BUT I WAS TRANSFIXED WITH HORROR UNABLE TO MOVE
ON HIS VOYAGE TO CEYLON THE ENGLISHMAN PERCIVAL MADE MUCH OF A KAFFIR WHO STAYED UNDER FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT COMING UP TO THE SURFACE BUT I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE
THEN DURING THE SILURIAN PERIOD THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS GRADUALLY APPEARED ABOVE THE WAVES ISLANDS EMERGED DISAPPEARED BENEATH TEMPORARY FLOODS ROSE AGAIN WERE FUSED TO FORM CONTINENTS AND FINALLY THE EARTH'S GEOGRAPHY SETTLED INTO WHAT WE HAVE TODAY
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE BAROMETER GENERALLY STAYED QUITE LOW
YOU'RE RIGHT PROFESSOR AND YOUR CAPTAIN'S A SUPERMAN
I LEFT HIM AND CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
GREEN PARROT SHELLS FROM THE SEAS OF CHINA
DISCOVERED IN 1511 BY THE PORTUGUESE FRANCISCO SERRANO THESE SHORES WERE SUCCESSIVELY VISITED BY DON JORGE DE MENESES IN 1526 BY JUAN DE GRIJALVA IN 1527 BY THE SPANISH GENERAL ALVARO DE SAAVEDRA IN 1528 BY INIGO ORTIZ IN 1545 BY THE DUTCHMAN SCHOUTEN IN 1616 BY NICOLAS SRUICK IN 1753 BY TASMAN DAMPIER FUMEL CARTERET EDWARDS BOUGAINVILLE COOK MCCLURE AND THOMAS FORREST BY REAR ADMIRAL D'ENTRECASTEAUX IN 1792 BY LOUIS-ISIDORE DUPERREY IN 1823 AND BY CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE IN 1827
NED LAND PROVED HIMSELF QUITE GLORIOUSLY WITH HIS GUNSHOT
BESIDES IT WOULDN'T PAIN ME TO EAT A COUPLE SLICES OF FRESH VENISON WITHOUT TRYING TO RECONCILE THE CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN CAPTAIN NEMO'S PROFESSED HORROR OF CONTINENTS OR ISLANDS AND HIS INVITATION TO GO HUNTING IN A FOREST I WAS CONTENT TO REPLY
ALL WALLS SHOULD BE BANNED FINE THE CANADIAN PUT IN
NOT ONE STAR WAS TWINKLING AND NIGHTTIME IS NEVER SO UTTERLY BLACK
THEY ADORNED THE SMALLEST CREVICES SOME SPRAWLING OTHERS STANDING OR HANGING LIKE CORAL OUTGROWTHS
NOW THEN JUST AS THIS DECISION WAS BEING HANDED DOWN ENGLISH VESSELS ARRIVED IN THE BAY OF VIGO ON OCTOBER 22 1702
I FELT US RISING TO THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
FURTHERMORE I HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON THE PLATFORM
LATIN
LATIN
LATIN
LATIN
LATIN
LATIN
LATIN
WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THESE MAN-EATERS ME CONSEIL SAID
LEAVING OLD BAHAMA CHANNEL WHICH IS FOURTEEN LEAGUES WIDE BY 350 METERS DEEP THE GULF STREAM MOVES AT THE RATE OF EIGHT KILOMETERS PER HOUR
THIS WOMAN WAS YOUNG
FROM THE BLACK MARKINGS ON THE TIPS OF ITS FINS I RECOGNIZED THE DREADFUL SQUALUS MELANOPTERUS FROM THE SEAS OF THE EAST INDIES A VARIETY IN THE SPECIES OF SHARKS PROPER
BUT THE SPECIFIC STIMULUS FOR THIS NOVEL WAS AN 1865 FAN LETTER FROM A FELLOW WRITER MADAME GEORGE SAND
A TOWN NOW IN RUINS WHOSE WALLS WOULD COLLAPSE AT THE MERE SOUND OF A CANNON AND WHICH SHELTERS A FEW LEAFY DATE TREES HERE AND THERE
I OPEN SOME STOPCOCKS THE TANKS FILL THE BOAT SINKS AND IT'S EXACTLY FLUSH WITH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FINE CAPTAIN BUT NOW WE COME TO A GENUINE DIFFICULTY
A SPLENDID NAME CAPTAIN NEMO MURMURED CROSSING HIS ARMS
UNTIL NOW ITS DYNAMIC POTENTIAL HAS REMAINED QUITE LIMITED CAPABLE OF PRODUCING ONLY SMALL AMOUNTS OF POWER PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED MY ELECTRICITY ISN'T THE RUN-OF-THE-MILL VARIETY AND WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT I WON'T INSIST SIR AND I'LL REST CONTENT WITH SIMPLY BEING FLABBERGASTED AT YOUR RESULTS
THE SPONGE IS DEFINITELY NOT A PLANT AS SOME NATURALISTS STILL BELIEVE BUT AN ANIMAL OF THE LOWEST ORDER A POLYPARY INFERIOR EVEN TO CORAL
AMONG THE LATTER I OBSERVED A SPECIES OF DOGFISH CALLED THE COW SHARK THAT'S EQUIPPED WITH SIX RESPIRATORY SLITS THE TELESCOPE FISH WITH ITS ENORMOUS EYES THE ARMORED GURNARD WITH GRAY THORACIC FINS PLUS BLACK PECTORAL FINS AND A BREASTPLATE PROTECTED BY PALE RED SLABS OF BONE THEN FINALLY THE GRENADIER LIVING AT A DEPTH OF 1,200 METERS BY THAT POINT TOLERATING A PRESSURE OF 120 ATMOSPHERES
A FLOATING LIGHTHOUSE SAID SOMEONE NEXT TO ME
NOW THEN IF I PROVIDE SOME BALLAST TANKS EQUAL IN CAPACITY TO THAT ONE-TENTH HENCE ABLE TO HOLD 150.72 METRIC TONS AND IF I FILL THEM WITH WATER THE BOAT THEN DISPLACES 1,507.2 METRIC TONS OR IT WEIGHS THAT MUCH--AND IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY SUBMERGED
BUT CAPTAIN NEMO KEPT CLIMBING
IT'S DARK ENOUGH FOR ONE
ON MAY 15 1824 HIS SHIP THE ST PATRICK PASSED BY TIKOPIA ISLAND ONE OF THE NEW HEBRIDES
AND SOON THIS MIST BEGAN TO CONDENSE INTO SNOW
THIS CORAL WAS THE EQUAL OF THOSE FISHED UP FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN OFF THE BARBARY COAST OR THE SHORES OF FRANCE AND ITALY
ON JANUARY 27 AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE HUGE BAY OF BENGAL WE REPEATEDLY ENCOUNTERED A GRUESOME SIGHT
THE ICE CRACKED WITH AN ODD RIPPING SOUND LIKE PAPER TEARING AND THE NAUTILUS BEGAN SETTLING DOWNWARD
THERE ENSUED A DREADFUL STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ELEMENTS OF FIRE AND WATER A STRUGGLE ENDING IN KING NEPTUNE'S FAVOR
THE LETTER N WAS NO DOUBT THE INITIAL OF THE NAME OF THAT MYSTIFYING INDIVIDUAL IN COMMAND BENEATH THE SEAS
NED LAND QUICKLY GREW ENTHUSIASTIC AND EVEN ENDED UP APPLAUDING
I WENT OVER TO THE CAPTAIN
FOR ORIENTALS IT'S A DROP OF SOLIDIFIED DEW
I COULD BARELY GLIMPSE THE SWIFT PASSING OF LONGNOSE SHARKS HAMMERHEAD SHARKS SPOTTED DOGFISH THAT FREQUENT THESE WATERS BIG EAGLE RAYS SWARMS OF SEAHORSE LOOKING LIKE KNIGHTS ON A CHESSBOARD EELS QUIVERING LIKE FIREWORKS SERPENTS ARMIES OF CRAB THAT FLED OBLIQUELY BY CROSSING THEIR PINCERS OVER THEIR CARAPACES FINALLY SCHOOLS OF PORPOISE THAT HELD CONTESTS OF SPEED WITH THE NAUTILUS
I SAW HIM ONLY AT RARE INTERVALS
SOME OF THESE JELLYFISH WERE SHAPED LIKE VERY SMOOTH SEMISPHERIC PARASOLS WITH RUSSET STRIPES AND FRINGES OF TWELVE NEAT FESTOONS
DETERMINED NOT TO LEAVE WITHOUT QUESTIONING HIM I DREW CLOSER
SIR HE ANSWERED ME I HAVE CHRONOMETERS VARIOUSLY SET TO THE MERIDIANS OF PARIS GREENWICH AND WASHINGTON D.C
BUT HE WAS RECKONING WITHOUT EVENTS
BY THEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO THIS TYPE OF TALK
THE VOLCANIC NATURE OF THIS ENORMOUS PIT WAS APPARENT ALL AROUND US
IT WAS INSTANTANEOUS AND NO SQUADRON OF SHIPS EVER MANEUVERED WITH GREATER TOGETHERNESS
BUT THESE ANIMALS DIDN'T FLEE SO SWIFTLY THAT OUR ELECTRIC CAPSULES COULDN'T CATCH UP WITH THEM
I'VE DETECTED AS MUCH CAPTAIN I REPLIED AND IF IT GETS EVEN SLIGHTLY HOTTER WE WON'T BE ABLE TO STAND IT OH PROFESSOR IT WON'T GET ANY HOTTER UNLESS WE WANT IT TO YOU MEAN YOU CAN CONTROL THIS HEAT NO BUT I CAN BACK AWAY FROM THE FIREPLACE PRODUCING IT SO IT'S OUTSIDE SURELY
I HAD NO FAITH IN THOSE PROMISING OPPORTUNITIES THAT NED LAND MENTIONED
THE PERFUMES YOU'LL FIND ON THE WASHSTAND IN YOUR CABIN WERE PRODUCED FROM THE OOZINGS OF MARINE PLANTS
I DISCOVERED IT BY CHANCE AND CHANCE SERVED ME WELL BUT COULDN'T SOMEONE ENTER THROUGH THE MOUTH OF ITS CRATER NO MORE THAN I COULD EXIT THROUGH IT
THAT FABRIC COVERING YOU WAS WOVEN FROM THE MASSES OF FILAMENTS THAT ANCHOR CERTAIN SEASHELLS
THERE I SAW THE COMPLETE WORKS OF HUMBOLDT THE COMPLETE ARAGO AS WELL AS WORKS BY FOUCAULT HENRI SAINTE-CLAIRE DEVILLE CHASLES MILNE-EDWARDS QUATREFAGES JOHN TYNDALL FARADAY BERTHELOT FATHER SECCHI PETERMANN COMMANDER MAURY LOUIS AGASSIZ ETC PLUS THE TRANSACTIONS OF FRANCE'S ACADEMY OF SCIENCES BULLETINS FROM THE VARIOUS GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETIES ETC AND IN A PRIME LOCATION THOSE TWO VOLUMES ON THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS THAT HAD PERHAPS EARNED ME THIS COMPARATIVELY CHARITABLE WELCOME FROM CAPTAIN NEMO
LET'S IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE
I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE
WOULDN'T HE SEE MY FOUR-MONTH SILENCE AS A TACIT ACCEPTANCE OF THIS SITUATION
THIS LIQUID MASS TOTALS 2,250,000,000 CUBIC MILES AND COULD FORM A SPHERE WITH A DIAMETER OF SIXTY LEAGUES WHOSE WEIGHT WOULD BE THREE QUINTILLION METRIC TONS
THEY WERE A SPECIES OF THOSE RABBIT KANGAROOS THAT USUALLY DWELL IN THE HOLLOWS OF TREES AND ARE TREMENDOUSLY FAST
I SPOTTED HIM STANDING ON A CHUNK OF BASALT
THEN SMALLER FISH APPEARED
YOU CAN MAKE FIGURES DO ANYTHING YOU WANT IN BUSINESS NED BUT NOT IN MATHEMATICS
WE DECIDED TO RETURN TO GUEBOROA ISLAND
NO IF WE'RE WELL OUT AND THE SHIP'S NAVIGATING UNDER THE WATERS AND IN THAT EVENT IN THAT EVENT I'LL TRY TO GET HOLD OF THE SKIFF
APPARENTLY THE JEALOUS ORB DIDN'T WANT TO REVEAL THIS INACCESSIBLE SPOT ON THE GLOBE TO ANY HUMAN BEING
IT'S THUMBING ITS NOSE AT ME
THERE I FOUND DINNER READY FOR ME
I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE LATEST RESEARCH ON THIS BIZARRE ZOOPHYTE WHICH TURNS TO STONE WHILE TAKING ON A TREE FORM AS SOME NATURALISTS HAVE VERY APTLY OBSERVED--AND NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE FASCINATING TO ME THAN TO VISIT ONE OF THESE PETRIFIED FORESTS THAT NATURE HAS PLANTED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
WHAT A FASCINATING FIELD OF STUDY LIES IN WATCHING THE PLAY OF ITS ORGANISM
OPEN UP THERE YOU ANTISOCIAL NAVIGATORS BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO MAKE YOURSELF HEARD ABOVE THE DEAFENING BEATS OF THE PROPELLER
THIS ELECTRIC LAMP WAS SO CONSTRUCTED AS TO YIELD ITS MAXIMUM ILLUMINATING POWER
A MASS EXECUTION 287 22
ANYONE WHO TOUCHED IT GOT A FEARSOME SHOCK AND SUCH A SHOCK WOULD HAVE BEEN FATAL IF CAPTAIN NEMO HAD THROWN THE FULL CURRENT FROM HIS EQUIPMENT INTO THIS CONDUCTING CABLE
MILLIMETER ROUGHLY 1/25 OF AN INCH
IT WAS A SQUID OF COLOSSAL DIMENSIONS FULLY EIGHT METERS LONG
BUT SOON THE NAUTILUS HUGGED THE EASTERN SHORE WHERE THESE TREE FORMS APPEARED IN ALL THEIR GLORY
AT 320 FEET OR TEN TIMES GREATER PRESSURE IT'S 175,680 KILOGRAMS
AND WHEN I COMPARED THIS DEEP CALM OF THE ELEMENTS WITH ALL THE FURY SEETHING INSIDE THE PLATING OF THIS BARELY PERCEPTIBLE NAUTILUS I SHIVERED ALL OVER
THIS WAS THE SECOND COMPANION HE HAD LOST SINCE WE HAD COME ABOARD
THIS IS THE ANIMAL THAT FIRST DRAGGED THE BASQUES IN ITS WAKE THEN ASTURIAN SPANIARDS ENGLISHMEN AND DUTCHMEN EMBOLDENING THEM AGAINST THE OCEAN'S PERILS AND LEADING THEM TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
IT WAS WRITHING IN THE WATERS
FOR TWO HOURS WE WERE SOMETIMES LED OVER PLAINS OF SAND SOMETIMES OVER PRAIRIES OF SEAWEED THAT WERE QUITE ARDUOUS TO CROSS
WHY WAS THE NAUTILUS STOPPING
NOW CAPTAIN NEMO SAID LET'S LOOK FOR OUR PASSAGEWAY ELECTRIC WIRES LINKED THE PILOTHOUSE WITH THE ENGINE ROOM AND FROM THIS CABIN THE CAPTAIN COULD SIMULTANEOUSLY SIGNAL HEADING AND SPEED TO HIS NAUTILUS
CONSEIL WHOM NOTHING COULD STARTLE SAW IT AS A PERFECTLY NATURAL THING TO FALL ASLEEP UNDER THE WAVES AND WAKE UP UNDER A MOUNTAIN
THE HURRICANE WAS UNLEASHED AT A SPEED OF FORTY-FIVE METERS PER SECOND HENCE ALMOST FORTY LEAGUES PER HOUR
SOME WERE SKILLFULLY SLAIN AND WHEN COOKED IN A CERTAIN FASHION THEY MAKE A VERY ACCEPTABLE PLATTER OF WATER GAME
WHAT YOU BELIEVE TO BE RED MEAT PROFESSOR IS NOTHING OTHER THAN LOIN OF SEA TURTLE
THERE I SAW CANVASES OF THE HIGHEST VALUE THE LIKES OF WHICH I HAD MARVELED AT IN PRIVATE EUROPEAN COLLECTIONS AND ART EXHIBITIONS
IT WAS ONLY ON MAY 1 THAT THE NAUTILUS OPENLY RESUMED ITS NORTHBOUND COURSE AFTER RAISING THE BAHAMAS AT THE MOUTH OF OLD BAHAMA CHANNEL
THE NAUTILUS WAS MOTIONLESS
WEARING CAPS MADE OF SEA-OTTER FUR AND SHOD IN SEALSKIN FISHING BOOTS THESE TWO STRANGERS WERE DRESSED IN CLOTHING MADE FROM SOME UNIQUE FABRIC THAT FLATTERED THE FIGURE AND ALLOWED GREAT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
THE FIRST SHIP WAS DESTROYED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
BUT TELL ME ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BONY FISH AND CARTILAGINOUS FISH JUST MAYBE CONSEIL AND HOW ABOUT THE SUBDIVISIONS OF THESE TWO LARGE CLASSES I HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST NOTION THE CANADIAN REPLIED
HIS LIFE STORY WRITTEN BY HIMSELF
YOU SENSED THAT IT WAS ALIVE
ARGONAUTS SO COMMON IN THE MEDITERRANEAN VOYAGED HERE IN SCHOOLS OF LARGE NUMBERS
BUT WE NOW KNOW THAT CAPTAIN NEMO DOESN'T AVOID THE SEAS OF CIVILIZATION AND IN A FEW DAYS I THINK WE CAN SAFELY TAKE ACTION NED LAND STARED AT ME STILL MORE INTENTLY AND FINALLY UNPURSED HIS LIPS
AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE THE OCEAN SEEMED LACTIFIED
UNDER THOSE TREES LAND ANIMALS LOADED WITH CUTLETS AND ROAST BEEF WHICH I'D BE HAPPY TO SINK MY TEETH INTO IN THIS INSTANCE OUR FRIEND NED IS RIGHT CONSEIL SAID AND I SIDE WITH HIS VIEWS
COME INTO THE LOUNGE
THE MOORINGS WERE CAST OFF AND WE PULLED CLEAR
BEHIND US TO THE SOUTH AND EAST
WE WERE FACING THE ISLAND OF VANIKORO PROPER TO WHICH CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE HAD GIVEN THE NAME ISLAND OF THE SEARCH
BEFORE EIGHT DAYS WERE OUT THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD PLOW THE WAVES OF THE PACIFIC
BUT YOUR WEAPON DIDN'T STICK IN ITS BODY MY HARPOON
IN CERTAIN LOCALITIES ITS CURRENT MOVES AT A SPEED OF FOUR KILOMETERS PER HOUR
WELL PROFESSOR WE HAVE GOOD REASON TO KNOW IT BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH
I FOLLOW YOU I SAID
I RECOGNIZED THE SOUTHERN RIGHT WHALE ITS HEAD SQUAT ITS BODY DARK ALL OVER
FOLLOWING THE SEPTEMBER EQUINOX THE SUN HAD EMERGED ABOVE THE NORTHERLY HORIZON RISING IN LONG SPIRALS UNTIL DECEMBER 21
WAS I APPROACHING SOME NATURAL PHENOMENON STILL UNKNOWN TO SCIENTISTS ON SHORE
HAVING FISHED IN THE ARCTIC SEAS NED LAND WAS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE SIGHT OF ICEBERGS
HIS REDDENED EYES HADN'T BEEN REFRESHED BY SLEEP
BLACK SURGEONFISH
I BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF A MAMMAL WITH A POWERFUL CONSTITUTION BELONGING TO THE VERTEBRATE BRANCH LIKE BALEEN WHALES SPERM WHALES OR DOLPHINS AND ARMED WITH A TUSK MADE OF HORN THAT HAS TREMENDOUS PENETRATING POWER HUMPH THE HARPOONER PUT IN SHAKING HIS HEAD WITH THE ATTITUDE OF A MAN WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE CONVINCED
HE WAS IN THE SAME LOUNGE I HAD TO CROSS IN ORDER TO ESCAPE
I DON'T SAY NAY TWO MILES FARTHER ON WE WERE STOPPED BY A PROMONTORY THAT SCREENED THE BAY FROM SOUTHERLY WINDS
HELP
HELP
HELP
YOU COULD SENSE THAT HIS EVERYDAY CONVERSATION MUST HAVE BEEN PACKED WITH SUCH VIVID FIGURES OF SPEECH AS PERSONIFICATION SYMBOLISM AND MISPLACED MODIFIERS
THE FINENESS AND LUSTER OF ITS PELT GUARANTEED THAT IT WOULD GO FOR AT LEAST 2,000 FRANCS
CHAPTER 7 A WHALE OF UNKNOWN SPECIES ALTHOUGH I WAS STARTLED BY THIS UNEXPECTED DESCENT I AT LEAST HAVE A VERY CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF MY SENSATIONS DURING IT
THE UNDERTAKING HAD ENDED HAPPILY AND IN ITS FIRST DISPATCH YOUNG AMERICA ADDRESSED OLD EUROPE WITH THESE WISE WORDS SO RARELY UNDERSTOOD
JUPITER WAS RISING IN THE EAST
MOBILIS IN MOBILI 35 9
NEEDLESS TO SAY NED LAND HAD TO GIVE UP HIS ESCAPE PLANS MUCH TO HIS DISTRESS
THE NEAREST LAND WAS THE ISLAND GROUP OF THE BAHAMAS SCATTERED LIKE A BATCH OF COBBLESTONES OVER THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
A MINUTE PASSED
THIS WASN'T THE FIRST TIME HE'D PAID IT A VISIT AND I THOUGHT HIS SOLE REASON FOR LEADING US TO THIS LOCALITY WAS TO SHOW US A NATURAL CURIOSITY
A PYRAMID-SHAPED BLOCK OF SHALE WITH A VERY SHARP SUMMIT WHICH DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT'S CLEAR OR VEILED IN VAPOR PREDICTS FAIR WEATHER OR FOUL AS NED LAND TOLD ME
THANKS TO THE MINDLESS BARBARIC BLOODTHIRSTINESS OF FISHERMEN THE LAST BALEEN WHALE WILL SOMEDAY DISAPPEAR FROM THE OCEAN
NEAR ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WE CUT THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN ON THE 37TH MERIDIAN PASSING WELL OUT FROM CAPE FRIO
THE CANADIAN WENT TO RESUME HIS POST ON THE BOBSTAYS UNDER THE BOWSPRIT
THE WIND WAS BLOWING A PRETTY STRONG GUST FROM THE SOUTH
THIS BAY REPEATEDLY DREDGED FURNISHED A HUGE SUPPLY OF EXCELLENT OYSTERS
THE RED GLOW HAD TURNED WHITE AND WAS RADIATING FROM A MOUNTAIN PEAK ABOUT 800 FEET HIGH
KRAKENS CONSEIL SHOT BACK FINISHING HIS WORD WITHOUT WINCING AT HIS COMPANION'S WITTICISM
ON JANUARY 21 TWO YEARS LATER AT A NEW SOUTHERLY POSITION OF 66 DEGREES 30 HE NAMED THE ADéLIE COAST AND EIGHT DAYS LATER THE CLARIE COAST AT 64 DEGREES 40 IN 1838 THE AMERICAN WILKES ADVANCED AS FAR AS THE 69TH PARALLEL ON THE 100TH MERIDIAN
OPINION HAD CRYSTALLIZED AS TO THE NATURE OF THIS PHENOMENON AND THE PUBLIC ACCEPTED WITHOUT ARGUMENT THE EXISTENCE OF A PRODIGIOUS CREATURE THAT HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE FABLED SEA SERPENT
IT'S AS ALIEN TO THE EARTH AS THE PLANETS ACCOMPANYING OUR GLOBE AROUND THE SUN AND WE'LL NEVER BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE WORK OF SCIENTISTS ON SATURN OR JUPITER
AND THIS WHOLE STURDY MECHANISM WOULD SURELY HAVE GIVEN WAY IF AS ITS CAPTAIN HAD SAID IT WEREN'T CAPABLE OF RESISTING LIKE A SOLID BLOCK
PACK AS MUCH INTO MY TRUNK AS YOU CAN MY TRAVELING KIT MY SUITS SHIRTS AND SOCKS DON'T BOTHER COUNTING JUST SQUEEZE IT ALL IN--AND HURRY WHAT ABOUT MASTER'S COLLECTIONS CONSEIL VENTURED TO OBSERVE
BUT THIS SUBSTANCE WAS MISSING ON BOARD AND NOTHING ELSE COULD REPLACE IT
AND FINALLY COURAGE SINCE HIS DEEP BREATHING DENOTED TREMENDOUS RESERVES OF VITALITY
PROFESSOR HE SAID TO ME WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO WITH ME TO THE WHEELHOUSE I WAS AFRAID TO ASK I REPLIED
I RUSHED TO THE WINDOW AND SAW CRUSTS OF CORAL
SOMETIMES I GO HUNTING RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THIS ELEMENT THAT HAS LONG SEEMED SO FAR OUT OF MAN'S REACH AND I CORNER THE GAME THAT DWELLS IN MY UNDERWATER FORESTS
IN FACT IT SOON WOULD HAVE HIT THE UNDERBELLY OF THE ICE BANK BUT IT HAD STOPPED IN TIME AND WAS FLOATING IN MIDWATER
AND WHAT A WAY TO DIE
NIGHT WAS COMING ON
THE EXTRAORDINARY INTENSITY OF HIS GAZE SEEMED TO ATTRACT IT BEGUILE IT AND DRAW IT MORE SURELY THAN IF HE HAD IT IN TOW
THEY'RE GENUINE LITTLE LEYDEN JARS CHARGED WITH HIGH-VOLTAGE ELECTRICITY
THERE THE OCEAN FLOOR FORMED A VALLEY 120 KILOMETERS WIDE INTO WHICH YOU COULD FIT MT
MIDNIGHT WAS APPROACHING
HERE'S A STURDY BLADE
THE RAGING SEA WAS SWEPT WITH HUGE TATTERED CLOUDS DRENCHED BY THE WAVES
WAKING UP I SAW NED LAND LEANING OVER ME AND I HEARD HIM TELL ME IN A LOW VOICE
IT COULD HONESTLY BE SAID THAT HE HAD STRETCHED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS ASSAILANTS A NETWORK OF ELECTRICITY NO ONE COULD CLEAR WITH IMPUNITY
BUT I CONCLUDED THAT MY PERSONAL INTERESTS COULD BE RECONCILED WITH THAT NATURAL COMPASSION TO WHICH EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS A RIGHT
THE FIRE IN HIS EYES AND THE PASSION IN HIS GESTURES TRANSFIGURED HIM
INSTANTLY THE SKIFF WHEELED AROUND UNDER THE EBB TIDE'S OUTBOUND THRUST
BUT I'LL SWEAR IT'S A WARSHIP BECAUSE THERE'S A LONG PENNANT STREAMING FROM THE PEAK OF ITS MAINMAST FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE CONTINUED TO WATCH THE CRAFT BEARING DOWN ON US
MORE THAN ONCE I TOOK A TUMBLE AT THE EXPENSE OF MY BACKSIDE
SO I THINK IT'S TIME WE GAVE CAPTAIN NEMO THE SLIP NED MY FRIEND I REPLIED UNLIKE YOU I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ON OUR VALIANT NAUTILUS AND IN FOUR DAYS WE'LL KNOW WHERE WE STAND ON THESE PACIFIC TIDES
I STARED IN MY TURN AND COULDN'T KEEP BACK A MOVEMENT OF REVULSION
WE COULD HOPE FOR NOTHING FROM THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER BUT COULD DEPEND ONLY ON OURSELVES
COD ARE FLAT ONLY AT THE GROCERY STORE WHERE THEY'RE CUT OPEN AND SPREAD OUT ON DISPLAY
ALL RIGHT THEN
ALL RIGHT THEN
SUBDUED LIGHTING
NEVER HAD CAUDAL EQUIPMENT THRASHED THE SEA WITH SUCH POWER
NOT A SOUND REACHED OUR EARS
CAPTAIN ANDERSON HIS OFFICERS AND THE ENGINEERS PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER THEN POSTED A WARNING THAT IF THE CULPRIT WERE DETECTED HE WOULD BE THROWN OVERBOARD WITHOUT A TRIAL
BRAVING THE ICE BANKS OF THE SOUTH POLE THE CORAL OF OCEANIA THE CANNIBALS OF THE PACIFIC ONLY TO PERISH WRETCHEDLY IN A TRAIN WRECK
AS SOON AS I WAS DRESSED I MADE MY WAY TO THE MAIN LOUNGE
BUT CAPTAIN NEMO KNEW THAT BY THIS POINT THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS TOO FAST SINCE MINUTES WERE NOW WORTH CENTURIES
WE'RE SINKING AT FIRST THE PASSENGERS WERE QUITE FRIGHTENED BUT CAPTAIN ANDERSON HASTENED TO REASSURE THEM
MY COMPANIONS AND I HAD DECIDED TO ESCAPE AS SOON AS THE VESSEL CAME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR US TO BE HEARD--OR SEEN BECAUSE THE MOON WOULD WAX FULL IN THREE DAYS AND WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY
BUT I CATCH MYSELF FOLLOWING IN THE CANADIAN'S FOOTSTEPS
AT ITS SUMMIT THERE GAPED THE CIRCULAR OPENING THROUGH WHICH I HAD DETECTED THAT FAINT GLIMMER OBVIOUSLY DAYLIGHT
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT THE CAPTAIN REPLIED EVASIVELY
ALMOST AT ONCE I SAW CAPTAIN NEMO APPEAR LIFT HIS SPYGLASS AND INSPECT THE HORIZON
JUST THEN IN THE LAST LIGHT OF A MOON SETTLING ON THE HORIZON I SPOTTED A FACE THAT WASN'T CONSEIL'S BUT WHICH I RECOGNIZED AT ONCE
WHILE THE LONGBOAT COASTED DROPS OF LIQUID FLICKED FROM THE OARS AND HIT THE DARK TROUGHS OF THE WAVES PITTER-PATTERING LIKE SPLASHES OF MOLTEN LEAD
HE TRIED TO MAKE STONES DO THE WORK OF BULLETS AND AFTER SEVERAL FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS HE MANAGED TO WOUND ONE OF THESE MAGNIFICENT BUSTARDS
I SAW ITS GREEN AND RED RUNNING LIGHTS PLUS THE WHITE LANTERN HANGING FROM THE LARGE STAY OF ITS FOREMAST
THE SEA WAS PRETTY SMOOTH AND BARELY TIRED US
IF SO WHAT DID HE FEEL
THE MARVELOUS TALENTS OF HIS NAUTILUS WOULD BE PUT TO WORK ONCE AGAIN IN THIS SUPERHUMAN UNDERTAKING
THERE'S THE IDEAL SHIP
YES THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL IF IT'S OVER WITH NED LAND MUTTERED
EVERYTHING COMES TO ME FROM THE SEA JUST AS SOMEDAY EVERYTHING WILL RETURN TO IT YOU LOVE THE SEA CAPTAIN YES I LOVE IT
MASTER WILL ALLOW ME TO MAKE AN INCISION HE SAID
EITHER COMMANDER FARRAGUT WOULD SLAY THE NARWHALE OR THE NARWHALE WOULD SLAY COMMANDER FARRAGUT
YOU GAVE ME YOUR PROMISE PROFESSOR ARONNAX AND I'M COUNTING ON YOU SINCE I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING THE CANADIAN STOOD UP AND APPROACHED ME
AFTER BREAKFAST I MADE MY WAY TO THE LOUNGE AND WENT ABOUT MY WORK
NED LAND BELLOWED
ANYONE CONSULTING CONSEIL WOULD SOON LEARN FROM THE GALLANT LAD THAT THE BRANCH MOLLUSCA IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE CLASSES
BULLETIN ED
BULLETIN ED
DURING THE NIGHT IN LINE WITH MY FORECASTS A NEW ONE-METER SLICE WAS REMOVED FROM THIS IMMENSE SOCKET
AT THIS LOCATION IN THREE OR FOUR FATHOMS OF WATER BETWEEN THE PAEU AND VANA REEFS THERE LAY SOME ANCHORS CANNONS AND INGOTS OF IRON AND LEAD ALL CAKED WITH LIMESTONE CONCRETIONS
PROPELLED BY THE WAVES A COCONUT ARRIVED ON THIS NEW COAST
HELP CEASING ALL MOVEMENT FOR AN INSTANT WE LISTENED
THEN IN ORDER I INTRODUCED PROFESSOR ARONNAX HIS MANSERVANT CONSEIL AND MR NED LAND HARPOONER
THEN DRIVEN BY ITS POWERFUL PROPELLER IT ATTACKED THIS ICE FIELD FROM BELOW LIKE A FEARSOME BATTERING RAM
HERE PROFESSOR ARONNAX IS A MANUSCRIPT WRITTEN IN SEVERAL LANGUAGES
AS FOR THE TABLEWARE IT WAS ELEGANT AND IN PERFECT TASTE
TWO THREE FIVE DOWN
WE AREN'T IN A KETTLE YET IN A KETTLE NO THE CANADIAN SHOT BACK BUT IN AN OVEN FOR SURE
THEY'RE EQUIPPED WITH A SPECIAL SYSTEM OF AIRTIGHT FASTENINGS AND CAN FIRE IN UNDERWATER CONDITIONS
THEN DROWSINESS OVERTOOK ME I STRETCHED OUT ON MY EELGRASS MATTRESS AND I FELL INTO A DEEP SLUMBER WHILE THE NAUTILUS GLIDED THROUGH THE SWIFTLY FLOWING BLACK CURRENT
BUT AT THE MOMENT OF OUR NOON SIGHTS THE SEA WAS DESERTED AND THE SHIP ROSE AGAIN TO ITS WATERLINE
AND MIRACULOUSLY WE ESCAPED A DANGER GREATER THAN ENCOUNTERING A TIGER DEEP IN THE JUNGLE
OUR PROVISIONS LOADED ON BOARD I WENT BELOW TO MY STATEROOM
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE WAS WAITING FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT TO JUMP OVERBOARD AND ATTACK THE CREATURE IN ITS OWN ELEMENT
HIS PHRASING WAS CLEAR HIS WORDS WELL CHOSEN HIS FACILITY IN ELOCUTION REMARKABLE
AND COULD YOU KINDLY TELL ME WHAT EVERYBODY KNOWS HE ASKED ME IN A GENTLY IRONIC TONE
I HAVE HIGH HOPES
MY ALPENSTOCK WAS A GREAT HELP
SOME OFFICERS WERE ALREADY PERCHED ON THE MASTHEADS
THIS CANAL COULD BE TRAVELED IN FOUR DAYS AND IT WAS SO WIDE TWO TRIPLE-TIERED GALLEYS COULD PASS THROUGH IT ABREAST
THESE WORDS PRONOUNCED THE CHIEF OFFICER WENT BELOW AGAIN
AND YET IF ONE OF THOSE CONICAL SHELLS HAD SCORED A ROUTINE HIT ON THE NAUTILUS'S HULL IT COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL TO HIM
WE WERE LIT BY A SUBDUED LIGHT
OVER OUR HEADS
IN ONE HIDEOUS PITCHING MOVEMENT THE NAUTILUS REARED ITS STEEL SPUR INTO THE AIR LIKE A LIGHTNING ROD AND I SAW LONG SPARKS SHOOT DOWN IT
SO THIS IS STILL THE QUESTION
PARALYZED RIGID WITH ANGUISH MY HAIR STANDING ON END MY EYES POPPING OUT OF MY HEAD SHORT OF BREATH SUFFOCATING SPEECHLESS I STARED I TOO
FOR CONSEIL THE CAPTAIN WAS STILL A MISUNDERSTOOD GENIUS WHO TIRED OF THE WORLD'S DECEPTIONS HAD BEEN DRIVEN TO TAKE REFUGE IN THIS INACCESSIBLE ENVIRONMENT WHERE HE WAS FREE TO FOLLOW HIS INSTINCTS
I'D LIKE TO COME FACE TO FACE WITH ONE OF THOSE DEVILFISH I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT WHICH CAN DRAG SHIPS DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS
LET'S ACCEPT THAT THE PRESSURE OF ONE ATMOSPHERE IS REPRESENTED BY THE PRESSURE OF A COLUMN OF WATER THIRTY-TWO FEET HIGH
WE COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR A MORE DEVOTED FOLLOWING
THE PACIFIC OCEAN EXTENDS NORTH TO SOUTH BETWEEN THE TWO POLAR CIRCLES AND EAST TO WEST BETWEEN AMERICA AND ASIA OVER AN EXPANSE OF 145 DEGREES OF LONGITUDE
OUR FULL ELECTRIC POWER WAS THEN PUT ON THE PUMPS WHICH INSTANTLY BEGAN TO EXPEL WATER FROM THE BALLAST TANKS
THE CAPTAIN OFFERED ME A CUP OF THIS STILL-WARM MILK
THANKS TO HIM AND HIS SUBMERSIBLE I WAS FINISHING MY UNDERSEA RESEARCH BY THE DAY AND I WAS REWRITING MY BOOK ON THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS IN THE MIDST OF ITS VERY ELEMENT
THE SPANISH COMMANDERS IN THE CONVOY OBJECTED TO THIS DECISION
IT WAS A HIGHLY APPROPRIATE MOTTO FOR THIS UNDERWATER MACHINE SO LONG AS THE PREPOSITION IN IS TRANSLATED AS WITHIN AND NOT UPON
NO DOUBT WE'LL BE ARRIVING A LITTLE EARLY
FROM THAT DAY FORWARD OUR POSITION WAS VERY STRAINED
IT BEHAVED IN THIS WAY FOR SOME DAYS
OVER TO SOMEBODY WITH BETTER AIM THE COMMANDER SHOUTED
VARIOUS ISIS CORAL CORNULARIAN CORAL LIVING IN ISOLATION TUFTS OF VIRGINAL GENUS OCULINA FORMERLY KNOWN BY THE NAME WHITE CORAL PRICKLY FUNGUS CORAL IN THE SHAPE OF MUSHROOMS SEA ANEMONE HOLDING ON BY THEIR MUSCULAR DISKS PROVIDING A LITERAL FLOWERBED ADORNED BY JELLYFISH FROM THE GENUS PORPITA WEARING COLLARS OF AZURE TENTACLES AND STARFISH THAT SPANGLED THE SAND INCLUDING VEINLIKE FEATHER STARS FROM THE GENUS ASTEROPHYTON THAT WERE LIKE FINE LACE EMBROIDERED BY THE HANDS OF WATER NYMPHS THEIR FESTOONS SWAYING TO THE FAINT UNDULATIONS CAUSED BY OUR WALKING
WE WERE SEPARATED FROM THE SEA BY TWO PANES OF GLASS
SPATULA-SHAPED PADDLEFISH WHOSE TAILS ARE COVERED WITH MANY SCALY RINGS
WAS IT ASLEEP PERHAPS WEARY FROM ITS WORKDAY JUST RIDING WITH THE WAVES
BUT IN ALL HONESTY THIS LOUNGE IS ENOUGH TO ASTONISH EVEN SOMEONE FLEMISH LIKE MYSELF INDULGE YOUR ASTONISHMENT MY FRIEND AND HAVE A LOOK BECAUSE THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK HERE FOR A CLASSIFIER OF YOUR TALENTS CONSEIL NEEDED NO ENCOURAGING
BUT PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN CHASED YOU OVER THE PACIFIC HIGH SEAS IN THE BELIEF IT WAS HUNTING SOME POWERFUL MARINE MONSTER WHICH HAD TO BE PURGED FROM THE OCEAN AT ALL COST A HALF SMILE CURLED THE COMMANDER'S LIPS
BENDING OVER THE GLASS CASES THE GALLANT LAD WAS ALREADY MUTTERING CHOICE WORDS FROM THE NATURALIST'S VOCABULARY
OUR POOR NED BROODS ABOUT ALL THE THINGS HE CAN'T HAVE
THE OTHER REPLIED WITH A SHAKE OF THE HEAD AND ADDED TWO OR THREE UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE WORDS
HOW TIME FLIES ON SOLID GROUND EXCLAIMED MR NED LAND WITH A SIGH OF REGRET
AS FOR ME I WAS NO LONGER CONTENT WITH THE HYPOTHESES THAT SATISFIED CONSEIL
THIS ISLAND GROUP COVERS A SURFACE AREA OF 370 SQUARE LEAGUES AND IT'S MADE UP OF SOME SIXTY SUBGROUPS AMONG WHICH WE NOTED THE GAMBIER GROUP WHICH IS A FRENCH PROTECTORATE
MAN-EATERS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN MY DREAMS
IF NOT MANY MONTHS MIGHT PASS BEFORE IT COULD LEAVE ITS CORAL BED
CONSEIL APPEARED
LORD KNOWS WHY BUT I SAW A DEFINITE CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS SICK CREWMAN AND YESTERDAY'S HAPPENINGS AND THE MYSTERY OF THOSE EVENTS CONCERNED ME AT LEAST AS MUCH AS THE MAN'S SICKNESS
SO ONLY TWO POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE QUESTION WERE LEFT CREATING TWO VERY DISTINCT GROUPS OF SUPPORTERS
MY HANDS WERE NO HELP TO ME
KINDLY FOLLOW THIS MAN THAT'S AN OFFER I CAN'T REFUSE THE HARPOONER REPLIED
FISH SACRED TO THE GODDESS VENUS THEIR EYES SET IN BROWS OF GOLD
THE SEA DOESN'T BELONG TO TYRANTS
COME TO THE SKIFF
THE GLOOM WAS PROFOUND
HOW CAN I PORTRAY THESE WOODS AND ROCKS IN THIS LIQUID SETTING THEIR LOWER PARTS DARK AND SULLEN THEIR UPPER PARTS TINTED RED IN THIS LIGHT WHOSE INTENSITY WAS DOUBLED BY THE REFLECTING POWER OF THE WATERS
BY JANUARY 2 WE HAD FARED 11,340 MILES HENCE 5,250 LEAGUES FROM OUR STARTING POINT IN THE SEAS OF JAPAN
FINALLY WOULD HE RETURN TO THE SEAS OF THE PACIFIC WHERE HIS NAUTILUS COULD NAVIGATE FREELY AND EASILY
HIS PURSED LIPS AND FROWNING BROW INDICATED THAT HE WAS IN THE GRIP OF HIS MONOMANIA
IN THE HARBOR NED LAND SAID SARCASTICALLY
PUBLIC OPINION BEING PRONOUNCED THE STATES OF THE UNION WERE THE FIRST IN THE FIELD
NO PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE NAUTILUS ISN'T CONSIGNED TO PERDITION
BUT THE CHASE CONTINUED AND CAPTAIN NEMO WAS CONTENT TO KEEP HIS DISTANCE
YES THE CANADIAN REPLIED A DISABLED CRAFT THAT'S SINKING STRAIGHT DOWN NED LAND WAS NOT MISTAKEN
WE COULD BREATHE
WE COULD BREATHE
BETWEEN THE LINES I KEPT SEEING FEARSOME WIDE-OPEN JAWS
WE HAD TO FOLLOW THE CAPTAIN WHO HEADED DOWN TRAILS SEEMINGLY KNOWN ONLY TO HIMSELF
THESE CHUNKS WEIGHED LESS THAN THE WATER AND BY AN UNUSUAL EFFECT OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY EACH CHUNK TOOK WING AS IT WERE TO THE ROOF OF THE TUNNEL WHICH THICKENED ABOVE BY AS MUCH AS IT DIMINISHED BELOW
THESE ARE THE GIANTS OF THE SPECIES WITH A CIRCUMFERENCE OF TWENTY FEET AND A LENGTH OF TEN METERS
THEY WERE UNABLE TO SAY
I CLOSE UP THE ONE BELONGING TO THE SKIFF SIMPLY BY SCREWING IT INTO PLACE
HOW DO YOU REACH THE LOWER DEPTHS WHERE YOU MEET AN INCREASING RESISTANCE THAT'S ASSESSED IN HUNDREDS OF ATMOSPHERES
OTHER ZOOPHYTES SWARMING NEAR THE SPONGES CONSISTED CHIEFLY OF A VERY ELEGANT SPECIES OF JELLYFISH
THE MAGICAL VISION DISAPPEARED
BUT THIS TIME AN EXPEDITION WAS AT ISSUE THAT COULD DRAG ON INDEFINITELY A HAZARDOUS UNDERTAKING WHOSE PURPOSE WAS TO HUNT AN ANIMAL THAT COULD SINK A FRIGATE AS EASILY AS A WALNUT SHELL
I SEARCHED FOR IT WITH MY NAUTILUS I DISCOVERED IT I VENTURED INTO IT
YET WHO KNOWS IF IT WOULD BE WELL RECEIVED
STRAIGHT AHEAD CONSEIL REPLIED
HE WAITED UNTIL I JOINED HIM THEN HE POINTED A FINGER AT SOME DARK MASSES OUTLINED IN THE SHADOWS A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND CAPTAIN NEMO STOPPED ON THESE LAST WORDS PERHAPS SORRY THAT HE HAD SAID TOO MUCH
I FOUND A PLACE NEAR HIM AND WAITED WITHOUT SPEAKING
WE TALKED LITTLE BEING TOO KEYED UP
SO PLEASE DO ME THE FAVOR OF WAITING A BIT BEFORE YOU FORM YOUR VIEWS ON THE COMMANDER AND CREW OF THIS BOAT MY VIEWS ARE FULLY FORMED NED LAND SHOT BACK
DID HE OBTAIN AIR USING CHEMICAL METHODS RELEASING THE OXYGEN CONTAINED IN POTASSIUM CHLORATE BY HEATING IT MEANWHILE ABSORBING THE CARBON DIOXIDE WITH POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE
I HADN'T A GUESS AND FOR MY PART I SPENT MY TIME STUDYING THE FISH THAT PASSED BEFORE MY EYES
THE MAIN LOUNGE 10 METERS LONG SEPARATED FROM THE CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM BY A SECOND WATERTIGHT BULKHEAD
GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A CALM PENETRATING VOICE I SPEAK FRENCH ENGLISH GERMAN AND LATIN WITH EQUAL FLUENCY
I SAY 150 METERS ALTHOUGH I HAD NO INSTRUMENTS FOR ESTIMATING THIS DISTANCE
I HEADED FOR THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY AND CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
THEY EVEN MENTION ONE OYSTER ABOUT WHICH I REMAIN DUBIOUS THAT SUPPOSEDLY CONTAINED AT LEAST 150 SHARKS 150 SHARKS NED LAND YELPED
IN FACT I COULD FEEL IT ASSUMING AN OBLIQUE POSITION LOWERING ITS STERN AND RAISING ITS SPUR
AND YOU PROFESSOR ARONNAX ARE YOU GOING TO STICK YOURSELF INSIDE THESE CLOTHES IT HAS TO BE MR NED HAVE IT YOUR WAY SIR THE HARPOONER REPLIED SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO SEE FOR MYSELF WELL PROFESSOR THE CANADIAN REPLIED YOU CAN JUST DROP THAT IDEA
MY CREW ARE STRONG AND FULL OF ENERGY AND THEY EAT WHAT I EAT SO I SAID ALL THESE FOODS ARE PRODUCTS OF THE SEA YES PROFESSOR THE SEA SUPPLIES ALL MY NEEDS
ALL THIS WATER CONTAINED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT AND AFTER IT WAS DECOMPOSED BY OUR POWERFUL BATTERIES THIS LIFE-GIVING ELASTIC FLUID COULD HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO US
WELL WE'VE GOT TO ACCEPT THE CANADIAN ANSWERED
AND WE FOLLOWED CAPTAIN NEMO HEADING TO THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY
THAT DEEP IN THE SEA SUCH ANIMALS WOULD NEED TO BE JUST AS STRONG AS YOU SAY IF THEY EXIST BUT IF THEY DON'T EXIST MY STUBBORN HARPOONER HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE ACCIDENT THAT HAPPENED TO THE SCOTIA IT'S MAYBE NED SAID HESITATING
YOU'RE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IN THOSE DAYS YOUR KING LOUIS XIV THOUGHT AN IMPERIAL GESTURE WOULD SUFFICE TO HUMBLE THE PYRENEES IN THE DUST SO HE INFLICTED HIS GRANDSON THE DUKE OF ANJOU ON THE SPANIARDS
GENUINE CABLES MORE THAN AN INCH THICK AND VERY TOUGH THEY'RE OFTEN USED AS MOORING LINES FOR SHIPS
WE STOOD DUMBSTRUCK HEARTS POUNDING BEFORE THIS SHIPWRECK CAUGHT IN THE ACT AS IF IT HAD BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED IN ITS FINAL MOMENTS SO TO SPEAK
CHAPTER 22 THE LAST WORDS OF CAPTAIN NEMO THE PANELS CLOSED OVER THIS FRIGHTFUL VIEW BUT THE LIGHTS DIDN'T GO ON IN THE LOUNGE
FLATFISH SUCH AS SOLE TURBOT DAB PLAICE BRILL ETC EXCELLENT REALLY EXCELLENT THE HARPOONER EXCLAIMED INTERESTED IN FISH ONLY FROM AN EDIBLE VIEWPOINT
WE KNOW THAT OYSTERS AND PILGRIM SCALLOPS LIVE IN 2,000 METERS OF WATER AND THAT ADMIRAL MCCLINTOCK ENGLAND'S HERO OF THE POLAR SEAS PULLED IN A LIVE SEA STAR FROM A DEPTH OF 2,500 METERS
SHE PRAISED VERNE'S TWO EARLY NOVELS FIVE WEEKS IN A BALLOON 1863 AND JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH 1864 THEN ADDED
TWO CREWMEN CARRYING INSTRUMENTS THE CAPTAIN CONSEIL AND I WERE ON BOARD
SOMETIMES I VENTURED OUT ON A WOBBLING TREE TRUNK FALLEN ACROSS A GORGE WITHOUT LOOKING DOWN HAVING EYES ONLY FOR MARVELING AT THE WILD SCENERY OF THIS REGION
I EVEN GOT A GLIMPSE OF HIM BECAUSE SOME RAYS OF LIGHT FROM THE LIBRARY HAD FILTERED INTO THE LOUNGE
FOR A GOOD WHILE THESE THOUGHTS OCCUPIED MY MIND AND I HAD A HUNCH THAT FATE WOULD SOON GIVE AWAY THE CAPTAIN'S SECRETS
WAS IT UNINTENTIONALLY THAT YOU TRAVELED ABOARD THAT FRIGATE
AFTER INVOLUNTARILY CLOSING MY EYES I REOPENED THEM AND SAW THAT THIS LUMINOUS FORCE CAME FROM A FROSTED HALF GLOBE CURVING OUT OF THE CABIN'S CEILING
ITS HEADING WAS SOUTHWESTERLY AND IN THREE DAYS IT HAD CLEARED THE 750 LEAGUES THAT SEPARATED LA PéROUSE'S ISLANDS FROM THE SOUTHEASTERN TIP OF PAPUA
ACCORDINGLY THEIR SCALY ANCESTORS INFEST THE ISLAND'S RIVERS AND ARE THE SUBJECTS OF SPECIAL VENERATION
IN THE DAMP SHADE BETWEEN THEM THERE WERE CLUSTERED ACTUAL BUSHES OF MOVING FLOWERS HEDGES OF ZOOPHYTES IN WHICH THERE GREW STONY CORAL STRIPED WITH TWISTING FURROWS YELLOWISH SEA ANEMONE FROM THE GENUS CARYOPHYLIA WITH TRANSLUCENT TENTACLES PLUS ANEMONE WITH GRASSY TUFTS FROM THE GENUS ZOANTHARIA
SUPERVISING OUR WORK WORKING HIMSELF CAPTAIN NEMO PASSED NEAR ME JUST THEN
IT'S A KING-SIZED TOOTH AS HARD AS STEEL
WHEN I REJOINED CAPTAIN NEMO I FOUND HIM LEANING SILENTLY AGAINST A PIECE OF ROCK AND STARING AT THE SKY
BY CALIPH AL-MANSUR IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT SUPPLIES FROM REACHING MOHAMMED IBN ABDULLAH WHO HAD REBELLED AGAINST HIM
THE ELECTRIC LIGHT SUDDENLY WENT OUT AND TWO ENORMOUS WATERSPOUTS CRASHED ONTO THE DECK OF THE FRIGATE RACING LIKE A TORRENT FROM STEM TO STERN TOPPLING CREWMEN BREAKING SPARE MASTS AND YARDARMS FROM THEIR LASHINGS
ACCORDINGLY I BECAME AWARE OF THE ISLE OF KARPATHOS ONE OF THE SPORADES ISLANDS ONLY WHEN CAPTAIN NEMO PLACED HIS FINGER OVER A SPOT ON THE WORLD MAP AND QUOTED ME THIS VERSE FROM VIRGIL
THE SOIL'S NATURE WAS STILL THE SAME
HAD HE SAID TOO MUCH
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I DON'T RULE OUT THAT THE INTERESTS OF SCIENCE COULD OVERRIDE EVEN THE NEED FOR FREEDOM WHICH PROMISES ME THAT IN EXCHANGE OUR ENCOUNTER WILL PROVIDE GREAT REWARDS I THOUGHT THE COMMANDER WOULD OFFER ME HIS HAND TO SEAL OUR AGREEMENT
THE NAUTILUS WAS IMPRISONED IN A GENUINE TUNNEL OF ICE ABOUT TWENTY METERS WIDE AND FILLED WITH QUIET WATER
AND INDEED UNLESS THIS REEF HAD AN ENGINE IN ITS BELLY HOW COULD IT MOVE ABOUT WITH SUCH PRODIGIOUS SPEED
MUCH TO HIS AMAZEMENT THE HARPOONER SEEMED NO MORE INTELLIGIBLE THAN I HAD BEEN
CAPTAIN NEMO WAS THERE LEANING OVER THE ORGAN DEEP IN A MUSICAL TRANCE
WHEN THE SHIPS OF THAT BOLD INVESTIGATOR ARRIVED IN THE SARGASSO SEA THEY HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY NAVIGATING IN THE MIDST OF THESE WEEDS WHICH MUCH TO THEIR CREWS DISMAY SLOWED THEM DOWN TO A HALT
NED LAND 14 5
THE LATTER DIVIDE INTO TWO GROUPS DIVE IN ROTATION AND DESCEND TO A DEPTH OF TWELVE METERS WITH THE HELP OF A HEAVY STONE CLUTCHED BETWEEN THEIR FEET AND ATTACHED BY A ROPE TO THEIR BOAT YOU MEAN I SAID THAT SUCH PRIMITIVE METHODS ARE STILL ALL THAT THEY USE ALL CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED ME ALTHOUGH THESE FISHERIES BELONG TO THE MOST INDUSTRIALIZED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE ENGLISH TO WHOM THE TREATY OF AMIENS GRANTED THEM IN 1802 YET IT STRIKES ME THAT DIVING SUITS LIKE YOURS COULD PERFORM YEOMAN SERVICE IN SUCH WORK YES SINCE THOSE POOR FISHERMEN CAN'T STAY LONG UNDERWATER
THEN IN A GENTLER VOICE HE WENT ON
I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT AN AMERICAN IS AT THE END OF HIS TETHER VISIBLY BAFFLED THE HARPOONER SAID NOTHING
THIS DUGONG THAT NED LAND WAS PREPARING TO ATTACK WAS OF COLOSSAL DIMENSIONS EASILY EXCEEDING SEVEN METERS IN LENGTH
AT HIS SIGNAL THE ANCHOR WAS LOWERED BUT ITS CHAIN BARELY RAN BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LAY NO MORE THAN A METER DOWN AND THIS LOCALITY WAS ONE OF THE SHALLOWEST SPOTS NEAR THE BANK OF SHELLFISH
WALTER 1433 CEDAR POST NO
THEN I RETURNED TO MY STATEROOM
I FOUND CAPTAIN NEMO THERE
STING RAYS THE SNOUT POINTED THE TAIL LONG SLENDER AND ARMED WITH AN EXTENSIVE JAGGED STING
SO I WAS CONTENT TO REPLY
CAPTAIN ANDERSON IMMEDIATELY MADE HIS WAY INTO THE HOLD
BUT THIS REPLY PROVED NOTHING OTHER THAN HOW BULLHEADED THE HARPOONER COULD BE
I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT
OBVIOUSLY ITS MADREPORIC ROCKS HAD BEEN MADE FERTILE BY TORNADOES AND THUNDERSTORMS
NONE OF THE NAUTILUS'S MEN WERE TO GO WITH US ON THIS NEW EXCURSION
WHO WAS THE RECIPIENT OF CAPTAIN NEMO'S GOLD
OTHERS HAVE BEEN WRENCHED NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY FROM THE UNDERSIDES OF VESSELS THAT NARWHALES HAVE PIERCED CLEAN THROUGH AS A GIMLET PIERCES A WINE BARREL
WITHOUT NEEDING TO BE CULTIVATED IT BEARS FRUIT EIGHT MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR
THE POLE
THE POLE
AN ISLAND LOCATED BETWEEN RHODES AND CRETE WHICH GREEKS NOW CALL KARPATHOS ITALIANS SCARPANTO
I SAW THAT WE WERE UNDER THREAT FROM A FEARSOME PAIR OF SHARKS
IT'S A PURPLISH MUCILAGINOUS SUBSTANCE PRODUCED BY THOSE TINY BUDS KNOWN BY THE NAME TRICHODESMIA 40,000 OF WHICH ARE NEEDED TO OCCUPY THE SPACE OF ONE SQUARE MILLIMETER
MASTER ON ONE SIDE NED LAND ON THE OTHER
AMONG THESE EXHIBITS I'LL MENTION JUST FOR THE RECORD
EREBUS AND MT
POLAR BIRDS NESTED ON THEM BY THE THOUSANDS
THE FRIGATE THEN WENT ALONG THE NEW JERSEY COAST--THE WONDERFUL RIGHT BANK OF THIS RIVER ALL LOADED DOWN WITH COUNTRY HOMES AND PASSED BY THE FORTS TO SALUTES FROM THEIR BIGGEST CANNONS
IT WAS A QUESTION OF SIMPLE ARITHMETIC
THEY FORM A VORTEX FROM WHICH NO SHIP HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE
HE ASSURED ME THAT THIS MILK WAS EXCELLENT NO DIFFERENT FROM COW'S MILK
WHAT A LOOK--AS IF HE COULD MAGNIFY OBJECTS SHRINKING INTO THE DISTANCE
AND YOU MY GALLANT CONSEIL YOU SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL NOT TOO MUCH TO BE CANDID WITH MASTER
IN 1794 THE NEW REPUBLIC OF FRANCE CHANGED THE NAME OF THIS SHIP
HE WAS THE DIRECT SOLE HEIR TO THESE TREASURES WRESTED FROM THE INCAS AND THOSE PEOPLES CONQUERED BY HERNANDO CORTEZ
THEY EVEN REPRINTED REPORTS FROM ANCIENT TIMES
IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THIS MEDITERRANEAN PINNED IN THE MIDDLE OF THOSE SHORES HE WANTED TO AVOID GAVE CAPTAIN NEMO NO PLEASURE
HOW MANY LIVES WERE DASHED IN THIS SHIPWRECK
CORRECT PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED ME
WE COULD HOPE TO BE PICKED UP
OUR VOYAGE WAS PROCEEDING UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE CONDITIONS
THE COWLS OVER THE COMPANIONWAYS WOULD VOMIT A TORRENT OF SAILORS AND OFFICERS
THE FIRST ENDED IN THAT MOVING SCENE AT THE CORAL CEMETERY WHICH LEFT A PROFOUND IMPRESSION ON MY MIND
THE NAUTILUS HAS HUGE AIR TANKS
OUR SOLE DIFFICULTY CAPTAIN NEMO WENT ON LIES IN OUR STAYING SUBMERGED FOR SEVERAL DAYS WITHOUT RENEWING OUR AIR SUPPLY THAT'S ALL I ANSWERED
I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE WHAT MY EYES SAW
OH IT'S MOVING OFF
A CORAL GRAVE IS A TRANQUIL GRAVE AND MAY HEAVEN GRANT THAT MY COMPANIONS AND I REST IN NO OTHER CHAPTER 20 THE TORRES STRAIT DURING THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER 27-28 THE NAUTILUS LEFT THE WATERWAYS OF VANIKORO BEHIND WITH EXTRAORDINARY SPEED
LOADING PROVISIONS AND WEAPONS INTO THE SKIFF PUSHING IT TO SEA AND POSITIONING ITS TWO OARS WERE THE WORK OF AN INSTANT
COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EFFORT IS SPENT IN REACHING THE OCEAN'S LOWER REGIONS BECAUSE ALL OBJECTS HAVE A TENDENCY TO BECOME SINKERS FOLLOW MY LOGIC HERE I'M ALL EARS CAPTAIN WHEN I WANTED TO DETERMINE WHAT INCREASE IN WEIGHT THE NAUTILUS NEEDED TO BE GIVEN IN ORDER TO SUBMERGE I HAD ONLY TO TAKE NOTE OF THE PROPORTIONATE REDUCTION IN VOLUME THAT SALT WATER EXPERIENCES IN DEEPER AND DEEPER STRATA THAT'S OBVIOUS I REPLIED
BUT HIS ANGER WAS DIVERTED BY THE SIGHT OF A BALEEN WHALE THAT THE NAUTILUS HAD PULLED ALONGSIDE OF JUST THEN
AND THAT'S HOW THESE ISLANDS WERE FORMED THE IMMENSE ACHIEVEMENT OF MICROSCOPIC ANIMALS
BUT WILL MASTER NOW TELL US HOW ONE GOES ABOUT EXTRACTING THESE PEARLS ONE PROCEEDS IN SEVERAL WAYS AND OFTEN WHEN PEARLS STICK TO THE VALVES FISHERMEN EVEN PULL THEM LOOSE WITH PLIERS
NO DOUBT MY COMPANIONS HAD BEEN PUT BACK IN THEIR CABIN WITHOUT NOTICING IT ANY MORE THAN I HAD
JELLYFISH MICROSCOPIC CRUSTACEANS AND SEA-PEN CORAL LIT IT FAINTLY WITH THEIR PHOSPHORESCENT GLIMMERS
THE RECKLESS MR LAND IS AT IT AGAIN DON'T WORRY PROFESSOR ARONNAX JUST KEEP ROWING THE CANADIAN REPLIED
IN LESS THAN TWENTY MINUTES SWEPT ALONG BY THE TORRENT THE NAUTILUS HAD JUST CLEARED THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ
A STONE CUT IN THE SHAPE OF A SUGAR LOAF WHICH HE GRIPPED BETWEEN HIS FEET WHILE A ROPE CONNECTED IT TO HIS BOAT SERVED TO LOWER HIM MORE QUICKLY TO THE OCEAN FLOOR
WE KEPT WATCH FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ACTION
AT OUR FEET
BUT GIVEN THE CURRENT STATE OF MARINE SCIENCE WHO ARE WE TO PRESUME WHAT DO WE REALLY KNOW OF THESE DEPTHS JUST THIS CAPTAIN
NEAR EVENING IT APPROACHED THE FALKLAND ISLANDS WHOSE RUGGED SUMMITS I RECOGNIZED THE NEXT DAY
WAS HE RELUCTANT TO SPEAK FURTHER
WE LOGGED 9,720 MILES WHEN WE PASSED BETWEEN THE TONGA ISLANDS WHERE CREWS FROM THE ARGO PORT-AU-PRINCE AND DUKE OF PORTLAND HAD PERISHED AND THE ISLAND GROUP OF SAMOA SCENE OF THE SLAYING OF CAPTAIN DE LANGLE FRIEND OF THAT LONG-LOST NAVIGATOR THE COUNT DE LA PéROUSE
THERE I DRESSED IN STURDY SEAFARING CLOTHES
HUMAN CORPSES FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
LIFE-SUSTAINING AIR REACHED OUR LUNGS
I DIDN'T SEE ANY WAY OUT OF THIS SHEET-IRON HERMETICALLY SEALED CELL
BY NOW I FELT REASSURED ABOUT OUR FATE AND IT SEEMED OBVIOUS THAT OUR HOSTS DIDN'T INTEND TO LET US DIE OF STARVATION
THIS LIGHT THROBBED WITH UNPRECEDENTED VIGOR AND ACTIVITY
AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN A RINGING IN MY EAR FROM THIS ORGAN FILLING WITH IMPEDED BLOOD BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT CONSEIL'S SHOUT HAD RECEIVED AN ANSWER BACK
FOR SOME WHILE THE VOYAGE OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS MARKED BY NO INCIDENT
ON DECEMBER 25 THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED AMID THE ISLAND GROUP OF THE NEW HEBRIDES WHICH THE PORTUGUESE SEAFARER QUEIRóS DISCOVERED IN 1606 WHICH COMMANDER BOUGAINVILLE EXPLORED IN 1768 AND TO WHICH CAPTAIN COOK GAVE ITS CURRENT NAME IN 1773
ENORMOUS TREES SOMETIMES AS HIGH AS 200 FEET WERE LINKED TO EACH OTHER BY GARLANDS OF TROPICAL CREEPERS GENUINE NATURAL HAMMOCKS THAT SWAYED IN A MILD BREEZE
THE SARGASSO SEA 214 12
WE WERE WALKING ON SAND THAT WAS FINE-GRAINED AND SMOOTH NOT WRINKLED LIKE BEACH SAND WHICH PRESERVES THE IMPRESSIONS LEFT BY THE WAVES
HE ADVANCED OVER THE PLATFORM NOT SEEMING TO NOTICE MY PRESENCE
THE NAUTILUS SEEMED TO BE STANDING STILL
BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD POINTED TO THE MOUNTAIN'S TOPMOST PEAK AND SEEMED TO TELL ME
I DISCUSSED THE QUESTION OF ATLANTIS WITH THE FERVOR OF A MAN WHO NO LONGER HAD ANY DOUBTS
I READ IT TO CONSEIL AND THE CANADIAN
BUT WHEN I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS I WAS LYING IN A FISHERMAN'S HUT ON ONE OF THE LOFOTEN ISLANDS
YES I REPLIED THEN VENTURED THE OPPOSITE VIEW
CLEAR CLEAR I REPLIED
OUTSIDE THE SEA WAS BRIGHTLY LIT BY THE BEACON SHINING BEHIND THE CABIN AT THE OTHER END OF THE PLATFORM
BUT THE SHIP DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THESE HEAVILY TRAVELED WATERWAYS
BESIDES THE SHORE LAY NO MORE THAN TWO MILES OFF AND IT WOULD BE CHILD'S PLAY FOR THE CANADIAN TO GUIDE THAT NIMBLE SKIFF THROUGH THOSE ROWS OF REEFS SO ILL-FATED FOR BIG SHIPS
THE CETACEAN HAD RAMMED OUR FRIGATE AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
AFTER SEVERAL FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS THE CREW MANAGED TO SLIP A NOOSE AROUND THE MOLLUSK'S BODY
OH HORRORS CONSEIL EXCLAIMED
WHILE THIS BIZARRE SCENERY WAS GLITTERING UNDER OUR ELECTRIC BEAMS I TOLD CONSEIL THE STORY OF THE ATLANTEANS WHO HAD INSPIRED THE OLD FRENCH SCIENTIST JEAN BAILLY TO WRITE SO MANY ENTERTAINING ALBEIT UTTERLY FICTITIOUS--PAGES I TOLD THE LAD ABOUT THE WARS OF THESE HEROIC PEOPLE
WE ALSO CAUGHT A LARGE NUMBER OF YELLOW-GREEN GILTHEAD HALF A DECIMETER LONG AND TASTING LIKE DORADO PLUS SOME FLYING GURNARDS AUTHENTIC UNDERWATER SWALLOWS THAT ON DARK NIGHTS ALTERNATELY STREAK AIR AND WATER WITH THEIR PHOSPHORESCENT GLIMMERS
WOULD IT GO TO THE POLE
AS FOR ME I CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THIS PHENOMENON
AND CARTILAGINOUS FISH IN OTHER WORDS THOSE WHOSE SPINES HAVE VERTEBRAE MADE OF CARTILAGE
I WAITED FOR NED LAND'S SIGNAL
THE NAUTILUS THEN ROLLED AND PITCHED LIKE A SHIP LEFT TO THE FURY OF THE ELEMENTS
AMONG CARTILAGINOUS FISH
AS WE SWUNG AROUND THE EMERALD ISLE I SPOTTED CAPE CLEAR FOR AN INSTANT PLUS THE LIGHTHOUSE ON FASTNET ROCK THAT GUIDES ALL THOSE THOUSANDS OF SHIPS SETTING OUT FROM GLASGOW OR LIVERPOOL
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THIS CAVE MADE UP MY DOUBLE-VALVED SHELL
BUT AFTER ALL WHAT WOULD I HAVE SAID TO HIM
MEANWHILE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT CAPTAIN NEMO STOOD LOST IN THOUGHT
THEY HAD COME TO PULL UP THE NETS LEFT IN OUR WAKE DURING THE NIGHT
AND IF WE EVER BROUGHT BACK TO EUROPE OR AMERICA A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS IT WOULD MAKE THE STORY OF OUR ADVENTURES MORE AUTHENTIC--AND MUCH MORE REWARDING THAT'S HOW I SEE IT THE CANADIAN SAID
AND THEY OPENED AMAZINGLY WIDE
AND EVEN IF THEY HAD THE FRIGATE BEING UNDONE BY ITS RUDDER--COULDN'T RETURN TO LEEWARD AFTER US
WHERE WAS I WHERE HAD CAPTAIN NEMO'S FANCIES TAKEN ME
UNDER THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH FATE HAD LEFT US IT WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE
DEPARTING FROM THE WATERWAYS OF GREECE ON THE MORNING OF FEBRUARY 16 WE CLEARED THE STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR BY SUNRISE ON THE 18TH
NO DOUBT IT WAS MY NATIONALITY THAT ATTRACTED HIM
TWO HOURS LATER THE THERMOMETER GAVE ONLY 4 DEGREES
I STRUGGLED AGAINST BEING DRAGGED INTO THE DEPTHS
NO DOUBT THE PRESENCE OF THE NAUTILUS EVEN MORE FEARSOME THAN ITSELF AND WHICH IT COULDN'T GRIP WITH ITS MANDIBLES OR THE SUCKERS ON ITS ARMS
CHAPTER 19 THE GULF STREAM THIS DREADFUL SCENE ON APRIL 20 NONE OF US WILL EVER BE ABLE TO FORGET
THEY WERE HUGE STACKS OF STONES IN WHICH YOU COULD DISTINGUISH THE INDISTINCT FORMS OF PALACES AND TEMPLES NOW ARRAYED IN HOSTS OF BLOSSOMING ZOOPHYTES AND OVER IT ALL NOT IVY BUT A HEAVY MANTLE OF ALGAE AND FUCUS PLANTS
AT SIX O'CLOCK THE DAY BROKE SUDDENLY WITH THAT SPEED UNIQUE TO TROPICAL REGIONS WHICH EXPERIENCE NO REAL DAWN OR DUSK
THERE LAY THE UNKNOWN
HE'S ATTACHED TO A PUMP THAT SENDS HIM AIR THROUGH AN INDIA-RUBBER HOSE
MEANWHILE AFTER TWELVE HOURS HAD GONE BY WE HAD REMOVED FROM THE OUTLINED SURFACE AREA A SLICE OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK HENCE ABOUT 600 CUBIC METERS
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO SEE US
ARE YOU BORED WITH THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING SIGHT OF THESE UNDERWATER WONDERS
THIS ACCIDENT HAPPENED AROUND FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING JUST AS DAY WAS BEGINNING TO BREAK
THE PUMPS BEGAN TO EXPEL WATER FROM THE BALLAST TANKS
MYRIADS OF LEAPING BLENNIES WITH BLACK STRIPES AND LONG PECTORAL FINS GLIDING OVER THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED
I WAS IN PRACTICE FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE JOINING THE MUSEUM EXCELLENT SIR MY REPLY OBVIOUSLY PLEASED CAPTAIN NEMO
ONE CONCERNED CAPTAIN NEMO'S MATCHLESS BRAVERY THE OTHER HIS DEVOTION TO A HUMAN BEING A REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT RACE FROM WHICH HE HAD FLED BENEATH THE SEAS
WE STARED AT THEM THROUGH OUR THICK GLASS WINDOWS
THE GREEK ISLANDS 176 7
FOR SOME MINUTES THE CAPTAIN STOOD MOTIONLESS ROOTED TO THE SPOT CONTAINED WITHIN THE FIELD OF HIS LENS
CAPTAIN NEMO DID NOT APPEAR
THE WAVES WERE SATURATED WITH MASSES OF BLOOD
CAPTAIN NEMO DIDN'T SEE THEM OR DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THEM
I WEIGHED ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS TURNED THEM OVER IN MY MIND SUBMITTED THEM TO CONSEIL BUT HE WAS AS BAFFLED AS I WAS
OTHER LOW CLOUDS FLED SWIFTLY
CONSEIL WAS IN ECSTASY
THEN PERTINENT TO THIS
THE PAINTINGS OF ILLINOIS WATERCOLORIST MILO WINTER 1888-1956 FIRST APPEARED IN A 1922 JUVENILE EDITION PUBLISHED BY RAND MCNALLY COMPANY
THOROUGHLY BAFFLED AFTER VAINLY EXHAUSTING OUR PHILOLOGICAL RESOURCES I NO LONGER KNEW WHAT TACTIC TO PURSUE WHEN CONSEIL TOLD ME
FIRST DIVISION IN THE POLYP GROUP THE CLASS SPONGIARIA HAS BEEN CREATED BY SCIENTISTS PRECISELY FOR THIS UNUSUAL EXHIBIT WHOSE USEFULNESS IS BEYOND DISPUTE
IN ANY EVENT EVERY MORNING WE SANITIZE THE SHIP BY VENTILATING IT IN THE OPEN AIR MEANWHILE I EXAMINED THE NAUTILUS'S ENGINE WITH A FASCINATION EASY TO IMAGINE
AT NOON CAPTAIN NEMO HIMSELF CAME TO TAKE OUR BEARINGS
THE COMPASS INDICATED THAT THE NAUTILUS HADN'T CHANGED DIRECTION
AS FOR THE FISH IN THESE WATERWAYS I NOTED VARIOUS SPECIES THAT I HADN'T YET HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY
I HELD THE CHRONOMETER
AS FOR CAPTAIN NEMO HE DIDN'T APPEAR
JUST NOW WE CAN'T EVEN DREAM OF RETURNING TO FRANCE
PATIENCE
SUBSEQUENTLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 18TH CENTURY THEY WERE NAMED THE MALOUINES BY FISHERMEN FROM SAINT-MALO IN BRITTANY THEN FINALLY DUBBED THE FALKLANDS BY THE ENGLISH TO WHOM THEY BELONG TODAY
HE GASPED HE CHOKED HE YELLED
IN WHICH CASE I COULD ONLY TAG ALONG AND RESUME OUR ICHTHYOLOGICAL RESEARCH
FIFTEEN DAYS LATER AND 2,000 LEAGUES FARTHER THE HELVETIA FROM THE COMPAGNIE NATIONALE AND THE SHANNON FROM THE ROYAL MAIL LINE RUNNING ON OPPOSITE TACKS IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC LYING BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE RESPECTIVELY SIGNALED EACH OTHER THAT THE MONSTER HAD BEEN SIGHTED IN LATITUDE 42 DEGREES 15 NORTH AND LONGITUDE 60 DEGREES 35 WEST OF THE MERIDIAN OF GREENWICH
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN THE LIKE
WHERE WOULD CAPTAIN NEMO'S FANCIES TAKE US
THEN PICKING UP A PIECE OF CHALKY STONE HE ADVANCED TO A BLACK BASALTIC ROCK AND SCRAWLED THIS ONE WORD
AN IMMENSE VISTA OF REFLECTIONS THAT PENETRATED EVERY LIQUID MOLECULE
ONE GESTURE FROM HIM COULD OBLITERATE ME A SINGLE WORD SHACKLE ME TO HIS VESSEL
IT WAS OBVIOUS THESE PAPUANS HAD ALREADY ENTERED INTO RELATIONS WITH EUROPEANS AND KNEW THEIR SHIPS
CERTAINLY I HAD NO COMPLAINTS TO REGISTER WITH HIM ON THE CONTRARY
IT WAS COMING ON FAST
SO UNLESS THIS REEF WAS SUBJECT TO THE INTERMITTENT ERUPTIONS OF A GEYSER THE GOVERNOR HIGGINSON HAD FAIR AND HONEST DEALINGS WITH SOME AQUATIC MAMMAL UNTIL THEN UNKNOWN THAT COULD SPURT FROM ITS BLOWHOLES WATERSPOUTS MIXED WITH AIR AND STEAM
CAPTAIN NEMO FILLED ME WITH INSURMOUNTABLE HORROR
AFTER SOME MINUTES A SHARP HISSING REACHED MY EARS
I CLIMBED ONTO IT INSTANTLY NED LAND AND CONSEIL ALONG WITH ME
THEN TURNING TO ME
THERE ALL ABOUT US I SWEAR THAT THE SHORES AND ICE FLOES WERE CROWDED WITH MARINE MAMMALS AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE AND I INVOLUNTARILY LOOKED AROUND FOR OLD PROTEUS THAT MYTHOLOGICAL SHEPHERD WHO GUARDED KING NEPTUNE'S IMMENSE FLOCKS
WE DESERVE TWO MEALS AND SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I'LL DO JUSTICE TO THEM BOTH ALL RIGHT NED LET'S WAIT AND SEE I REPLIED
NED LAND MARRIED TO CLEOPATRA CONSEIL EXCLAIMED
I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK THAT THE CAPTAIN'S RECKLESSNESS MORE THAN JUSTIFIED NED LAND'S WORST FEARS
I GOT UP SEVERAL TIMES
TEMPORARILY HOWEVER A FEW MANAGED TO KEEP PACE IN THE NAUTILUS'S WATERS
THEN HE STRODE RIGHT TOWARD THE MONSTER DAGGER IN HAND READY TO FIGHT IT AT CLOSE QUARTERS
WHAT COULD I ANSWER HIM
IN ANY EVENT WHATEVER HIS METHOD WAS IT SEEMED PRUDENT TO ME THAT HE USE THIS METHOD WITHOUT DELAY
THEN I GLIMPSED A FEW BRIGHT CONSTELLATIONS THROUGH THE CRYSTAL WATERS SPECIFICALLY FIVE OR SIX OF THOSE ZODIACAL STARS TRAILING FROM THE TAIL END OF ORION
SLIDING UNDER OUR HULL THIS BLOCK THEN RAISED US WITH IRRESISTIBLE POWER LIFTING US INTO LESS CONGESTED STRATA WHERE WE NOW LIE ON OUR SIDE BUT CAN'T WE FLOAT THE NAUTILUS CLEAR BY EMPTYING ITS BALLAST TANKS TO REGAIN OUR BALANCE THAT SIR IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW
WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING PROFESSOR THE NAUTILUS ENTERED THIS LAGOON THROUGH A NATURAL CHANNEL THAT OPENS TEN METERS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
MEANWHILE CONSEIL AND I SELECTED THE FINEST ARTOCARPUS FRUIT
HIS MOODS GREW GLOOMIER AND GLOOMIER
GOING UP CEYLON'S WEST COAST DURING THE NIGHT THE NAUTILUS LAY WEST OF THE BAY OR RATHER THAT GULF FORMED BY THE MAINLAND AND MANNAR ISLAND
YES FRANCS
THE CAPTAIN STOOD UP AND TOOK ONE LAST LOOK AT THESE IMMENSE PLAINS
MEANWHILE I WAS ASTONISHED AT THE FRIGATE'S MANEUVERS
HE GREW STILL MORE PALE UNDER THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THAT BATHED HIS DEATHBED
DID YOU HEAR THAT I MUTTERED
TWENTY MILES TO THE WEST LAY GUIANA FRENCH TERRITORY WHERE WE COULD EASILY HAVE TAKEN REFUGE
WOULD YOU ACCEPT I DON'T KNOW I REPLIED
THE MONSTER'S MOUTH--A BEAK MADE OF HORN AND SHAPED LIKE THAT OF A PARROT--OPENED AND CLOSED VERTICALLY
ITS BODY AND TAIL ARE ADORNED WITH CALLOSITIES
WE WERE FINALLY IN THE AREA OF THE MONSTER'S LATEST ANTICS
WE'RE NO LONGER IN MOTION CAPTAIN NEMO WENT OUT
NEVERTHELESS ALLOW ME TO INFORM YOU THAT BY HARVESTING THIS VERY BAY OF VIGO YOU'RE SIMPLY FORESTALLING THE EFFORTS OF A RIVAL ORGANIZATION WHAT ORGANIZATION A COMPANY CHARTERED BY THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO SEARCH FOR THESE SUNKEN GALLEONS
SHEER CHANCE HAD PLACED ME IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MOST VALUABLE SPECIMENS OF THIS ZOOPHYTE
THIS WAS OFF THE COAST OF TIHAMA AND THERE SUCH ZOOPHYTE DISPLAYS NOT ONLY FLOURISHED BELOW SEA LEVEL BUT THEY ALSO FASHIONED PICTURESQUE NETWORKS THAT UNREELED AS HIGH AS TEN FATHOMS ABOVE IT
OARS IN POSITION FIVE OF THE NAUTILUS'S SAILORS WERE WAITING FOR US ABOARD THE SKIFF WHICH WAS MOORED ALONGSIDE
THE NAUTILUS CONTINUED GROPING
ON MARCH 15 WE PASSED BEYOND THE LATITUDE OF THE SOUTH SHETLAND AND SOUTH ORKNEY ISLANDS
BY THEN IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
BY THEN WE HAD FARED 16,000 LEAGUES SINCE COMING ON BOARD IN THE SEAS OF JAPAN
FISH CONSEIL EXCLAIMED
IT WAS AN IMMENSE FOREST HUGE MINERAL VEGETATION ENORMOUS PETRIFIED TREES LINKED BY GARLANDS OF ELEGANT HYDRAS FROM THE GENUS PLUMULARIA THOSE TROPICAL CREEPERS OF THE SEA ALL DECKED OUT IN SHADES AND GLEAMS
I INSERT MYSELF THROUGH THIS DOUBLE OPENING INTO THE LONGBOAT
IN ESSENCE A WHALING VESSEL HAD REPORTED THAT SOME MEDALS AND A CROSS OF ST LOUIS HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE HANDS OF SAVAGES IN THE LOUISIADE ISLANDS AND NEW CALEDONIA
BUT IN GENERAL OUR PROGRESS WAS SLOW BECAUSE OUR FEET KEPT SINKING INTO A KIND OF SLIMY MUD MIXED WITH SEAWEED AND ASSORTED FLAT STONES
THIS SUDDEN ILLUMINATION OF OUR CABIN ENABLED ME TO EXAMINE ITS TINIEST DETAILS
I WOULD SOON FIND OUT
IT WAS SENT TO THE PUMPS WHILE NEW WATER REPLACED IT IN THE PROCESS
TERROR IN FULLY ACTIVE CONDITION ON THE 167TH MERIDIAN AT LATITUDE 77 DEGREES 32 THE VEGETATION ON THIS DESOLATE CONTINENT STRUCK ME AS QUITE LIMITED
GO ON NED HOW MANY MEN DO YOU THINK ARE ON BOARD THE NAUTILUS I'M UNABLE TO SAY MY FRIEND IT SEEMS TO ME NED LAND WENT ON THAT IT WOULDN'T TAKE MUCH OF A CREW TO RUN A SHIP LIKE THIS ONE CORRECT I REPLIED
ON THE 27TH IT PASSED IN SIGHT OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS WHERE THE FAMOUS CAPTAIN COOK MET HIS DEATH ON FEBRUARY 14 1779
YOUR FRIEND CONSEIL THE FINE LAD REPLIED SERENELY HAS NOTHING TO SAY FOR HIMSELF
AFTER EXAMINING THIS COMMUNITY OF WALRUSES I DECIDED TO RETURN IN MY TRACKS
SO AS I PREDICTED THAT MAN DIED DURING THE NIGHT YES PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED
WITH WHOM WERE WE DEALING
WE WERE PRISONERS ONCE MORE UNWILLING SPECTATORS AT THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS GRUESOME DRAMA
LITTLE DID THEY KNOW WHAT WAS WAITING FOR THEM
IN ESSENCE NUMEROUS FISH HAD CAUGHT HIS EYE AND WHEN FISH PASS BY CONSEIL VANISHES INTO HIS WORLD OF CLASSIFYING AND LEAVES REAL LIFE BEHIND
STILL HANGING FROM THE TIP OF ITS MUTILATED FIN WAS A LITTLE BABY WHALE THAT IT HAD BEEN UNABLE TO RESCUE FROM THE SLAUGHTER
WHOLE WEEKS HAD OFTEN GONE BY WITHOUT MY ENCOUNTERING HIM
I WAS TEMPTED TO GATHER THEIR FRESH PETALS WHICH WERE ADORNED WITH DELICATE TENTACLES SOME NEWLY IN BLOOM OTHERS BARELY OPENED WHILE NIMBLE FISH WITH FLUTTERING FINS BRUSHED PAST THEM LIKE FLOCKS OF BIRDS
HE OBSERVED THESE DESERTED WATERWAYS CAREFULLY
CONSEIL AND THE CANADIAN WERE ALREADY THERE
MY IMPERFECT MEMORIES WON'T LET ME RECALL MY EVERY IMPRESSION OF IT
IT'S MOVING BACK AND FORTH
I OBSERVED THAT VEGETABLE LIFE WAS DISAPPEARING MORE QUICKLY THAN ANIMAL LIFE
MAYBE THESE PEOPLE HAVE GONE WITHOUT FRESH MEAT FOR A LONG WHILE AND IN THAT CASE THREE HEALTHY WELL-BUILT SPECIMENS LIKE THE PROFESSOR HIS MANSERVANT AND ME GET RID OF THOSE IDEAS MR LAND I ANSWERED THE HARPOONER
THIS FORECAST FAIR WEATHER
THIS WAY YOU'LL LEARN THE FULL STORY ABOUT THIS COMBINATION UNDERWATER AND UNDERGROUND NAVIGATING CAPTAIN NEMO LED ME TO THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY
YOU OBSERVE THIS CONFINED BAY
DURING THIS PERIOD THE FISH CONSEIL AND I OBSERVED DIFFERED LITTLE FROM THOSE WE HAD ALREADY STUDIED IN OTHER LATITUDES
WE WOULDN'T GO FIVE MILES WITHOUT BUMPING INTO A FELLOW COUNTRYMAN
DELICIOUS SAILFISH THAT CAN HOIST THEIR FINS IN A FAVORABLE CURRENT LIKE SO MANY UNFURLED SAILS
THIS LONG AQUATIC VEHICLE COULD BARELY FEEL THE BROAD UNDULATIONS OF THE OCEAN
A YELLOW BEAK BROWN FEET AND CLAWS HAZEL WINGS WITH PURPLE TIPS PALE YELLOW HEAD AND SCRUFF OF THE NECK EMERALD THROAT THE BELLY AND CHEST MAROON TO BROWN
HE SUMMONED HIS ENGINEER
YOU'RE ABLE TO LIE FLUSH WITH THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN THAT I UNDERSTAND
YET HE DIDN'T ATTACK
IN ITS STRUGGLES THE MAN-EATER CHURNED THE WATERY MASS SO FURIOUSLY ITS EDDIES THREATENED TO KNOCK ME OVER
IF AT THIS POINT YOU WANT TO EMPTY THE SUPPLEMENTARY BALLAST TANKS IN ORDER TO LIGHTEN YOUR BOAT AND RISE TO THE SURFACE YOUR PUMPS MUST OVERCOME THAT PRESSURE OF 100 ATMOSPHERES WHICH IS 100 KILOGRAMS PER EACH SQUARE CENTIMETER
TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS JULES VERNE AN UNDERWATER TOUR OF THE WORLD TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL FRENCH BY F
IF MASTER'S EYES WOULD KINDLY STOP BULGING MASTER WILL SEE FARTHER BUT WHAT A WASTE OF ENERGY
DID IT STILL HAVE COMPARABLE SURPRISES IN STORE FOR ME
I WAS HOPING TO DETECT THE SECRET OF HIS LIFE IN THE LAST WORDS THAT MIGHT ESCAPE FROM HIS LIPS
AND THE NAUTILUS IS STILL FLOATING IT ALWAYS FLOATS BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WAIT A LITTLE WHILE
BUT WILL WE FLOAT OFF I ASKED HIM
THE HUMIDISTAT WHICH INDICATES THE DEGREE OF DRYNESS IN THE ATMOSPHERE
THESE UNIFYING THREADS TIGHTEN THE NARRATIVE AND ACCELERATE ITS MOMENTUM
MEANWHILE THE NAUTILUS ACCELERATED ITS BACKWARD MOVEMENT AND RUNNING WITH PROPELLER IN REVERSE IT SWEPT US ALONG AT GREAT SPEED
SUDDENLY ALL THE WAY FROM THE DARK HORIZON WHERE IT HAD GONE TO GATHER MOMENTUM THE MONSTER ABRUPTLY DASHED TOWARD THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WITH FRIGHTENING SPEED STOPPED SHARPLY TWENTY FEET FROM OUR SIDE PLATES AND DIED OUT NOT BY DIVING UNDER THE WATER SINCE ITS GLOW DID NOT RECEDE GRADUALLY BUT ALL AT ONCE AS IF THE SOURCE OF THIS BRILLIANT EMANATION HAD SUDDENLY DRIED UP
IN 1839 THE ENGLISHMAN BALLENY DISCOVERED THE SABRINA COAST AT THE EDGE OF THE POLAR CIRCLE
IT DIFFERS FROM THE MANATEE IN THAT ITS UPPER JAW IS ARMED WITH TWO LONG POINTED TEETH THAT FORM DIVERGING TUSKS ON EITHER SIDE
MY HANDS PARTED LIQUID CURTAINS THAT CLOSED AGAIN BEHIND ME AND MY FOOTPRINTS FADED SWIFTLY UNDER THE WATER'S PRESSURE
THERE WAS NO LACK OF OXYGEN
PROFESSOR YOU MUST NEVER MAKE SNAP JUDGMENTS ABOUT YOUR FELLOW MAN BUT CAPTAIN BELIEVE ME KINDLY LISTEN TO ME AND YOU'LL SEE IF YOU HAVE GROUNDS FOR ACCUSING ME OF INSANITY OR SELF-CONTRADICTION I'M ALL ATTENTION PROFESSOR YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT A MAN CAN LIVE UNDERWATER SO LONG AS HE CARRIES WITH HIM HIS OWN SUPPLY OF BREATHABLE AIR
FISHERMEN GATHER IN THE GULF OF MANNAR ONLY DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH AND FOR THIRTY DAYS SOME 300 BOATS CONCENTRATE ON THE LUCRATIVE HARVEST OF THESE TREASURES FROM THE SEA
CONSEQUENTLY THIS EXTRAORDINARY CETACEAN COULD TRANSFER ITSELF FROM ONE LOCALITY TO ANOTHER WITH STARTLING SWIFTNESS SINCE WITHIN AN INTERVAL OF JUST THREE DAYS THE GOVERNOR HIGGINSON AND THE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS HAD OBSERVED IT AT TWO POSITIONS ON THE CHARTS SEPARATED BY A DISTANCE OF MORE THAN 700 NAUTICAL LEAGUES
CONSEIL AND I COULD ONLY LINE UP BEHIND HIM
THE SURFACE OF THE SEA GLISTENED UNDER ITS RAYS
AND SUPPOSE HE ADDS THAT THIS OFFER HE'S MAKING YOU TODAY WON'T EVER BE REPEATED THEN WOULD YOU ACCEPT I DID NOT REPLY
COLD-BLOODED VERTEBRATES WITH A DOUBLE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM BREATHING THROUGH GILLS AND DESIGNED TO LIVE IN WATER THEY CONSIST OF TWO DISTINCT SERIES
I'VE TALKED YOU'VE LISTENED
THE LATTER REFLECTED THE SUN'S RAYS FROM THE THOUSAND FACETS OF THEIR CRYSTALS
IF MASTER FACES THESE SHARKS CONSEIL SAID I THINK HIS LOYAL MANSERVANT SHOULD FACE THEM WITH HIM CHAPTER 3 A PEARL WORTH TEN MILLION NIGHT FELL
I SAMPLED ITS FLESH BUT FOUND IT TASTELESS DESPITE CONSEIL'S VIEWS WHICH WERE LARGELY APPROVING
COME ON IT'S YOUR TURN I TOLD THE HARPOONER
HIS DIALOGUES TIMAEUS AND CRITIAS WERE DRAFTED WITH THE POET AND LEGISLATOR SOLON AS THEIR INSPIRATION AS IT WERE
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I ULTIMATELY WASN'T SORRY THAT HE REFUSED
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND HE WENT ON THAT THE CONGEALING OF THIS WATER COULD COME TO OUR RESCUE
BUT THIS RETURN TO THE UPPER STRATA WASN'T SO SUDDEN THAT DECOMPRESSION TOOK PLACE TOO QUICKLY WHICH COULD HAVE LED TO SERIOUS ORGANIC DISORDERS AND GIVEN US THOSE INTERNAL INJURIES SO FATAL TO DIVERS
HE HADN'T GONE TO BED
AND EACH OF THESE SUPPLIERS RECEIVED MY SPECIFICATIONS UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME BUT I WENT ON ONCE THESE PARTS WERE MANUFACTURED DIDN'T THEY HAVE TO BE MOUNTED AND ADJUSTED PROFESSOR I SET UP MY WORKSHOPS ON A DESERTED ISLET IN MIDOCEAN
IF THIS IS THE CASE AND CAPTAIN NEMO STILL INHABITS THE OCEAN HIS ADOPTED COUNTRY--MAY THE HATE BE APPEASED IN THAT FIERCE HEART
IF IT KEPT UP THIS PACE FORTY HOURS WOULD DO IT FOR REACHING THE POLE
THE INDIAN OCEAN 138 2
I WAS READILY COMPENSATED FOR THIS DELAY BY FASCINATING RESEARCH
BESIDES I'M NOT A NEGRO AND EVEN IF I WERE A NEGRO IN THIS INSTANCE I DON'T THINK A LITTLE HESITATION ON MY PART WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE AND THERE I WAS FANTASIZING ABOUT SHARKS ENVISIONING HUGE JAWS ARMED WITH MULTIPLE ROWS OF TEETH AND CAPABLE OF CUTTING A MAN IN HALF
THE SUN WOULD DISAPPEAR BELOW THE HORIZON FOR SIX MONTHS NOT COUNTING REFRACTION AND AFTER ITS DISAPPEARANCE THE LONG POLAR NIGHT WOULD BEGIN
SWEPT ALONG AT THE RATE OF TWELVE TO THIRTEEN METERS PER SECOND HE COULD HARDLY MAKE USE OF THE SKIFF
VANIKORO 96 20
FINALLY TO CONCLUDE CONSEIL CLASSIFIED A LARGE NUMBER OF FLYING FISH
OUR STRENGTH RETURNED PROMPTLY AND WHEN I LOOKED AROUND I SAW THAT WE WERE ALONE ON THE PLATFORM
LONG-LEGGED SPIDER CRABS VIOLET CRABS AND SPONGE CRABS UNIQUE TO THE WATERS OF THE CARIBBEAN
WE'RE ABOUT TO DEPART HE SAID
IT'S SURE TO TAKE THE PLACE OF WIND WATER AND STEAM BUT THAT'S NOT ALL PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO SAID STANDING UP
BUT HE WAS CONTENT WITH A DOZEN OF THESE FASCINATING MARSUPIALS WHICH MAKE UP THE FIRST ORDER OF APLACENTAL MAMMALS AS CONSEIL JUST HAD TO TELL US
RAYS AND MAN-EATERS IN THE SAME ORDER
VERY CORDIALLY YOURS J
AND IN ALL HONESTY BEFORE I LEAVE HIM FOREVER I WANT TO FINISH THIS UNDERWATER TOUR OF THE WORLD WHOSE FIRST STAGES HAVE BEEN SO MAGNIFICENT
CORAL SELLS FOR AS MUCH AS 500 FRANCS PER KILOGRAM AND IN THIS LOCALITY THE LIQUID STRATA HID ENOUGH TO MAKE THE FORTUNES OF A WHOLE HOST OF CORAL FISHERMEN
IT'S THIS FEELING OF BEING ALIEN TO YOUR DEEPEST CONCERNS THAT MAKES OUR SITUATION UNACCEPTABLE IMPOSSIBLE EVEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME BUT ESPECIALLY FOR NED LAND
YOU'RE A MAN WHO GATHERS HIS TREASURE IN PERSON
I'M NOT SAYING FISH AREN'T GOOD FOR YOU BUT WE MUSTN'T OVERDO EM AND A SLICE OF FRESH VENISON GRILLED OVER LIVE COALS WILL BE A NICE CHANGE FROM OUR STANDARD FARE YOU GLUTTON CONSEIL REPLIED YOU'RE MAKING MY MOUTH WATER IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN I SAID WHETHER THESE FORESTS DO CONTAIN GAME AND IF THE TYPES OF GAME AREN'T OF SUCH SIZE THAT THEY CAN HUNT THE HUNTER FINE PROFESSOR ARONNAX REPLIED THE CANADIAN WHOSE TEETH SEEMED TO BE AS HONED AS THE EDGE OF AN AX
IN ADDITION TO BANANAS WE GATHERED SOME ENORMOUS JACKFRUIT WITH A VERY TANGY FLAVOR SOME TASTY MANGOES AND SOME PINEAPPLES OF UNBELIEVABLE SIZE
MR CONSEIL PUT ONE OVER ON ME ACTUALLY HE'S RIGHT I SAID
I GUIDED OUR STEPS TOWARD A HUGE BAY THAT MADE A CRESCENT-SHAPED INCISION IN THE GRANITE CLIFFS ALONG THE BEACH
AT FIRST THIS CAVE LOOKED PITCH-BLACK TO ME
WE BARELY HAD TIME TO HANG ON TO ITS TOPSIDE WHICH EMERGED ABOUT EIGHTY CENTIMETERS ABOVE WATER
ITS UNSTABLE COLOR WOULD CHANGE WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED AS THE ANIMAL GREW IRRITATED PASSING SUCCESSIVELY FROM BLUISH GRAY TO REDDISH BROWN
THIS GULF STREAM IS A HUGE HEAT GENERATOR THAT ENABLES THE COASTS OF EUROPE TO BE DECKED IN ETERNAL GREENERY
SIX MONTHS AGO WE COULD HAVE BEEN BACK IN FRANCE IN MASTER'S LITTLE APARTMENT CONSEIL ANSWERED
THEY CALLED IT NAUTILUS AND POMPILIUS BUT MODERN SCIENCE HAS NOT ENDORSED THESE DESIGNATIONS AND THIS MOLLUSK IS NOW KNOWN BY THE NAME ARGONAUT
BY THEN ALL OUR PAST SUFFERINGS WERE FORGOTTEN
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STAND UPRIGHT INSIDE THE NAUTILUS
NONE OF THE WEEDS CARPETING THE SEAFLOOR NONE OF THE BRANCHES BRISTLING FROM THE SHRUBBERY CREPT OR LEANED OR STRETCHED ON A HORIZONTAL PLANE
IN SHORT SEVERAL SPECIMENS OF INCALCULABLE WORTH THAT HAD BEEN OOZED BY THE RAREST OF SHELLFISH
THE NAUTILUS NO LONGER KEPT TO A FIXED HEADING
I SAW A HAPPY GLEAM IN THE GALLANT LAD'S EYES AND TO COMMUNICATE HIS PLEASURE HE JIGGLED AROUND INSIDE HIS CARAPACE IN THE WORLD'S SILLIEST WAY
OTHERS LOOKED LIKE ENORMOUS AMETHYSTS LETTING THE LIGHT PENETRATE THEIR INSIDES
IT WAS FIVE MILES FROM US AND FORMED NO MORE THAN A DARK BARELY PERCEPTIBLE MASS
THESE CETACEANS HE ASKED ARE THEY AS BIG AS THE ONES IN THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS PRETTY NEARLY NED BECAUSE I'VE SEEN BIG BALEEN WHALES SIR WHALES MEASURING UP TO 100 FEET LONG
I LIKEWISE ASSUMED THAT NO CREWMEN WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO US THAT NED LAND WOULD BE IN SOLE CHARGE OF PILOTING THE LONGBOAT
THE NAUTILUS RETURNS TO ME AT YOUR COMMAND AT MY COMMAND
SO I'VE JUST ONE THING TO SAY TO YOU
ONE WAS SHORT AND STOCKY POWERFULLY MUSCLED BROAD SHOULDERED ROBUST OF LIMBS THE HEAD SQUAT THE HAIR BLACK AND LUXURIANT THE MUSTACHE HEAVY THE EYES BRIGHT AND PENETRATING AND HIS WHOLE PERSONALITY STAMPED WITH THAT SOUTHERN-BLOODED ZEST THAT IN FRANCE TYPIFIES THE PEOPLE OF PROVENCE
MACKEREL BONITO ALBACORE AND A FEW VARIETIES OF THAT SEA SERPENT NAMED THE MORAY EEL
THESE PLANTS ARE ENTIRELY SELF-PROPAGATING AND THE PRINCIPLE OF THEIR EXISTENCE LIES IN THE WATER THAT SUSTAINS AND NOURISHES THEM
THIS DAZZLING CARPET WAS A REAL MIRROR THROWING BACK THE SUN'S RAYS WITH STARTLING INTENSITY
BUT THE NAUTILUS SOON PICKED UP SPEED AND EASILY LEFT ASTERN THE FASTEST OF THESE MAN-EATERS
YOU COULD FEEL THE SAME SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE ENKINDLING THEIR EVERY SOUL
JUST LONG SOOT-COLORED UNDULATIONS WITH CRESTS SO COMPACT THEY DIDN'T FOAM
MY GALLANT CONSEIL FELT THE SAME SYMPTOMS SUFFERED THE SAME SUFFERINGS YET NEVER LEFT MY SIDE
FINALLY AT 32,000 FEET OR 1,000 TIMES GREATER PRESSURE IT'S 17,568,000 KILOGRAMS
YOU ATTACKED ME
SO IT FOLLOWS THAT AT 320 FEET DOWN THIS PRESSURE IS EQUAL TO TEN ATMOSPHERES TO 100 ATMOSPHERES AT 3,200 FEET AND TO 1,000 ATMOSPHERES AT 32,000 FEET THAT IS AT ABOUT TWO AND A HALF VERTICAL LEAGUES DOWN
THE SNOW WAS PILING UP IN SUCH PACKED LAYERS IT HAD TO BE CHIPPED LOOSE WITH BLOWS FROM PICKS
AFTER FOUR HOURS OF STROLLING I WAS QUITE ASTONISHED NOT TO FEEL ANY INTENSE HUNGER
PAPUA IS 400 LEAGUES LONG BY 130 LEAGUES WIDE WITH A SURFACE AREA OF 40,000 GEOGRAPHIC LEAGUES
WHERE AREN'T THERE SAVAGES
BUT IF THERE'S NO OTHER QUADRUPED ON THIS ISLAND I'LL EAT TIGER--TIGER SIRLOIN OUR FRIEND NED GROWS DISTURBING CONSEIL REPLIED
IT WAS THE REGIME OF VERTICALITY
FOR SEVERAL HOURS THE NAUTILUS'S SPUR SLICED THROUGH THESE WHITISH WAVES AND I WATCHED IT GLIDE NOISELESSLY OVER THIS SOAPY WATER AS IF IT WERE CRUISING THROUGH THOSE FOAMING EDDIES THAT A BAY'S CURRENTS AND COUNTERCURRENTS SOMETIMES LEAVE BETWEEN EACH OTHER
THAT'S THE FLOATING SIGNAL LIGHT OF SUEZ HE WENT ON
IF I GIVE THESE HIGHLY CONDENSED DETAILS IT IS SO EVERYONE CAN FULLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS MARITIME TRANSPORTATION COMPANY KNOWN THE WORLD OVER FOR ITS SHREWD MANAGEMENT
ALTHOUGH PRIOR ENGLISH VERSIONS HAVE OFTEN BEEN HEAVILY ABRIDGED THIS NEW TRANSLATION IS COMPLETE TO THE SMALLEST SUBSTANTIVE DETAIL
ONE RESOURCE STILL LEFT WAS TO SPEAK ENGLISH
WAS HE RELIVING HIS MEMORIES OF THAT COUNTRY HE HAD LEFT BEHIND
I ALSO INVESTIGATED THE HUGE PLANT ALBUMS THAT WERE FILLED WITH THE RAREST MARINE HERBS WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY WERE PRESSED AND DRIED STILL KEPT THEIR WONDERFUL COLORS
I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF
I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF
I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF
THEY HELD MY HANDS AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS I COULD BREATHE LUXURIOUSLY
HOREB THAT BIBLICAL MT
UNDOUBTEDLY THE LATTER'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHEN THE CANADIAN HIT IT WITH HIS HARPOON HAD LED COMMANDER FARRAGUT TO RECOGNIZE THE NARWHALE AS ACTUALLY AN UNDERWATER BOAT MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANY UNEARTHLY CETACEAN
THE INTENSITY OF THESE UNDERGROUND FORCES CONTINUES TO DIMINISH
NED LAND HAD CLEAR VIEWS ON THE ISSUE
THIS MAGNIFICENT BENEFACTION FROM THE MAN OF THE WATERS TO THE POOR INDIAN FROM CEYLON WAS ACCEPTED BY THE LATTER WITH TREMBLING HANDS
WHAT'S THIS NED I ASKED
AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF SILENCE WHICH NONE OF US WOULD HAVE DREAMED OF INTERRUPTING
I HEARD THE PICK RINGING ON THE LIMESTONE SOIL ITS IRON TIP SOMETIMES GIVING OFF SPARKS WHEN IT HIT A STRAY PIECE OF FLINT ON THE SEA BOTTOM
CAPTAIN NEMO'S TREASURES WERE ENHANCED BY SOME VALUABLE EXHIBITS FROM THE DELPHINULA SNAIL SPECIES TO WHICH I JOINED SOME POINTED STAR CORAL A SORT OF PARASITIC POLYPARY THAT OFTEN ATTACHES ITSELF TO SEASHELLS
HE SEEMED LIKE SOME SPIRIT OF THE SEA AND AS HE WALKED AHEAD OF ME I MARVELED AT HIS TALL FIGURE WHICH STOOD OUT IN BLACK AGAINST THE GLOWING BACKGROUND OF THE HORIZON
HONESTLY SIR HE TOLD ME
DAY AND NIGHT WE OBSERVED THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN AND THOSE WITH NYCTALOPIC EYES WHOSE ABILITY TO SEE IN THE DARK INCREASED THEIR CHANCES BY FIFTY PERCENT HAD AN EXCELLENT SHOT AT WINNING THE PRIZE
THAT DAY I STARTED MY DIARY OF THESE ADVENTURES WHICH HAS ENABLED ME TO NARRATE THEM WITH THE MOST SCRUPULOUS ACCURACY
HOW MANY COLLISIONS HAVE OCCURRED WITH THESE REEFS WHERE THE BREAKING SURF IS COVERED BY THE NOISE OF THE WIND
THE NEXT DAY I WAS SHORT-WINDED
THIS WAS WHERE THE NAUTILUS HAD BEEN SENT ACCIDENTALLY OR PERHAPS DELIBERATELY--BY ITS CAPTAIN
CAPTAIN NEMO STOOD UP
FARTHER ON LAY A PART OF THE GLOBE HE WOULD NO LONGER TREAD UNDERFOOT
TOTAL
FULL OF ANXIETY I ATE LITTLE
THE CAPTAIN ALONE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE CAVE WHERE THIS WONDERFUL FRUIT OF NATURE WAS RIPENING
THE DARKNESS WAS SO PROFOUND I COULDN'T SEE EVEN CAPTAIN NEMO
IT STRETCHES FROM DUCIE ISLAND TO LAZAREFF ISLAND OVER AN AREA OF 500 LEAGUES FROM THE EAST-SOUTHEAST TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST BETWEEN LATITUDE 13 DEGREES 30 AND 23 DEGREES 50 SOUTH AND BETWEEN LONGITUDE 125 DEGREES 30 AND 151 DEGREES 30 WEST
I MARVELED AT ITS STRANGE APPEARANCE IN THE MIDST OF THE BLACK ROCKS SURROUNDING IT AGAINST WHICH THE WHITE OF ITS HOUSES AND FORTS STOOD OUT SHARPLY
THE PLATFORM EMERGED ONLY EIGHTY CENTIMETERS ABOVE THE WAVES
THE STORM BURST DURING THE DAYTIME OF MAY 13 JUST AS THE NAUTILUS WAS CRUISING ABREAST OF LONG ISLAND A FEW MILES FROM THE NARROWS TO UPPER NEW YORK BAY
HIS PROVISIONS WERE LOADED ON BOARD
DURING THIS CROSSING THE SEA CONTINUALLY LAVISHED US WITH THE MOST MARVELOUS SIGHTS
HE STOOD IN THE BOW NEXT TO HIS FLAG WHICH A MILD BREEZE WAS UNFURLING ABOVE HIS HEAD
THE LOUNGE WINDOWS SEEMED TO BE WARPING INWARD UNDER THE WATER'S PRESSURE
RIGHT OFF I OBSERVED A CLUSTER OF MOUNTAINS ABOUT 2,000 FEET HIGH WHOSE SHAPES WERE VERY WHIMSICALLY SCULPTED
YES I FELT MYSELF COOKING IN ACTUAL FACT
KAPOGO WHICH IS 476 FATHOMS HIGH
WAS IT OUR PROXIMITY TO THESE EUROPEAN SHORES
AND YET I WILL FEEL SOME REGRET AT MAKING OFF WITH THE NAUTILUS'S SECRETS SO GENEROUSLY UNVEILED FOR US BY CAPTAIN NEMO
CAPTAIN NEMO GAVE A SHOUT AND LEAPED OUTSIDE
BUT NOT HEARING ANY SOUNDS I APPROACHED
IT WENT MORE TO THE NORTH HUGGED THE MURRAY ISLANDS AND RETURNED TO THE SOUTHWEST NEAR CUMBERLAND PASSAGE
THIS ENCOUNTER SEEMED SO MINOR THAT NOBODY ON BOARD WOULD HAVE BEEN DISTURBED BY IT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SHOUTS OF CREWMEN IN THE HOLD WHO CLIMBED ON DECK YELLING
NED AND CONSEIL HAD NO TIME FOR SUCH MUSINGS
THE NAUTILUS PASSED OVER THESE LUSH LUXURIANT DEPTHS WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED
I'LL FINISH UP THIS CATALOG A LITTLE DRY BUT QUITE ACCURATE WITH THE SERIES OF BONY FISH I OBSERVED
THEIR GREEK NAME ANTHIAS MEANS FLOWER AND THEY LIVE UP TO IT IN THE PLAY OF THEIR COLORS AND IN THOSE FLEETING REFLECTIONS THAT TURN THEIR DORSAL FINS INTO WATERED SILK
THIS CURRENT SWEPT ALONG WITH IT A WHOLE HOST OF MOVING CREATURES
WHAT I CAN NOW ASSERT IS THAT I'VE EARNED THE RIGHT TO SPEAK OF THESE SEAS BENEATH WHICH IN LESS THAN TEN MONTHS I'VE CLEARED 20,000 LEAGUES IN THIS UNDERWATER TOUR OF THE WORLD THAT HAS SHOWN ME SO MANY WONDERS ACROSS THE PACIFIC THE INDIAN OCEAN THE RED SEA THE MEDITERRANEAN THE ATLANTIC THE SOUTHERNMOST AND NORTHERNMOST SEAS
DID I EVER TRY TO BIND YOU WITH YOUR WORD OF HONOR THE CAPTAIN STARED AT ME CROSSING HIS ARMS
THE NAUTILUS WAS STILL IN PORTUGUESE WATERS
BUT IN THE MORNING WEARING MY DIVING SUIT I WAS CROSSING THROUGH THE LIQUID MASS IN A TEMPERATURE OF 6 DEGREES TO 7 DEGREES CENTIGRADE WHEN I NOTED THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SIDE WALLS WERE CLOSING IN ON EACH OTHER
THE HOLE GREW LONGER WIDER AND SOON WAS DEEP ENOUGH TO RECEIVE THE BODY
AND NOW WHAT WERE NED LAND'S VIEWS ON THIS QUESTION OF A MARINE MONSTER
THE SEA WAS FAIRLY CALM
NEAR ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WE CLEARED THE LOWER SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS THAT FORM THE ISLAND'S CENTER AND WE STILL HADN'T BAGGED A THING
WE HEAVED THE LOG A SECOND TIME
I UNDERSTOOD
I UNDERSTOOD
CONSEIL I MUTTERED
AS IF HE COULD PIERCE THOSE SHEETS OF WATER SO OPAQUE TO OUR EYES AND SCAN THE DEEPEST SEAS
BLUISH GRAY DRAGONETS WITH WRINKLED HEADS
THE WEATHER WAS THOROUGHLY FOUL
BUT WHERE'S HE GOING I ASKED
I'LL SPARE YOU THE INNUMERABLE HYPOTHESES WITH WHICH WE'VE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THIS INEXPLICABLE PHENOMENON WHOSE SECRET IS YOURS ALONE
NED MY FRIEND I SAID HERE'S MY REPLY
MISTAKING THE NAUTILUS FOR THE CORPSE OF A WHALE SOME OF THEM ALIGHTED ON IT AND PRODDED ITS RESONANT SHEET IRON WITH PECKS OF THEIR BEAKS
THE SERIES OF BONY FISH IN OTHER WORDS THOSE WHOSE SPINES HAVE VERTEBRAE MADE OF BONE
MEANWHILE CAPTAIN NEMO STUDIED THE HERD OF CETACEANS THEN ADDRESSED ME
NO ONE EVEN THOUGHT OF SLEEPING
THE ONLY UNUSUAL OBJECT I PICKED UP WAS AN AUK'S EGG OF REMARKABLE SIZE FOR WHICH A COLLECTOR WOULD HAVE PAID MORE THAN 1,000 FRANCS
HIS CHEST WAS HEAVING SWELLING WITH SOBS
SO SITUATED THIS VOLCANO WAS AN IMMENSE TORCH THAT LIT UP THE LOWER PLAINS ALL THE WAY TO THE HORIZON
FOR A MAN OUT OF PRACTICE AT TREADING LAND THE CAPTAIN SCALED THE STEEPEST SLOPES WITH A SUPPLE AGILITY I COULDN'T EQUAL AND WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ENVIED BY HUNTERS OF PYRENEES MOUNTAIN GOATS
IN WHAT ORDER DID THESE ARTICULATES BELONG THESE CREATURES FOR WHICH THE ROCKS PROVIDED A SECOND CARAPACE
NOTHING ELSE UNTIL THE MOMENT WHEN THROUGH A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS I SAW THE DARING CAPTAIN CLINGING TO ONE OF THE ANIMAL'S FINS FIGHTING THE MONSTER AT CLOSE QUARTERS BELABORING HIS ENEMY'S BELLY WITH STABS OF THE DAGGER YET UNABLE TO DELIVER THE DECIDING THRUST IN OTHER WORDS A DIRECT HIT TO THE HEART
NED AND CONSEIL SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THE DAY WITH ME
THIS IS ACCURATELY TRANSLATED AS TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS--RATHER THAN THE SEA AS WITH MANY ENGLISH EDITIONS
MY HEAD STRUCK AGAINST AN IRON TIMBER AND WITH THIS VIOLENT SHOCK I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS
BUT AFTER THE WIND HAD LULLED THIS TEMPERATURE DIDN'T SEEM TOO UNBEARABLE
UNDER THIS PRESSURE THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN REACHED AN AVERAGE SPEED OF 18.3 MILES PER HOUR A CONSIDERABLE SPEED BUT STILL NOT ENOUGH TO COPE WITH OUR GIGANTIC CETACEAN
AS FOR SEALS AND WALRUSES THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO LIVING IN THE HARSHEST CLIMATES AND STAYED ON IN THESE ICY WATERWAYS
CHAPTER 23 CONCLUSION WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION OF THIS VOYAGE UNDER THE SEAS
THAT DREADFUL DAY OF JUNE 2 HAD DAWNED
HOLD ON TIGHT BEFORE I HAD TIME TO REALIZE WHY THE CAPTAIN MADE THIS RECOMMENDATION I WAS HURLED TO THE CARPET
DESPITE THE DISTANCE DESPITE THE NOISE OF WIND AND SEA WE COULD DISTINCTLY HEAR THE FEARSOME THRASHINGS OF THE ANIMAL'S TAIL AND EVEN ITS PANTING BREATH
AND SO BY LOADING UP ITS BALLAST TANKS OR BY SINKING OBLIQUELY WITH ITS SLANTING FINS THE NAUTILUS SUCCESSIVELY REACHED DEPTHS OF 3,000 4,000 5,000 7,000 9,000 AND 10,000 METERS AND THE ULTIMATE CONCLUSION FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS WAS THAT IN ALL LATITUDES THE SEA HAD A PERMANENT TEMPERATURE OF 4.5 DEGREES CENTIGRADE AT A DEPTH OF 1,000 METERS
FINALLY AMONG THE ANOMURA HE SAW COMMON DROCINA CRABS DWELLING INSIDE WHATEVER ABANDONED SEASHELLS THEY COULD TAKE OVER HOMOLA CRABS WITH SPINY FRONTS HERMIT CRABS HAIRY PORCELAIN CRABS ETC
YOU'VE NEVER EATEN ANY SIR NO NED ALL RIGHT GET READY FOR SOMETHING DOWNRIGHT DELECTABLE
AMONG CARTILAGINOUS FISH THE MOST REMARKABLE WERE RAYS WHOSE ULTRA SLENDER TAILS MADE UP NEARLY A THIRD OF THE BODY WHICH WAS SHAPED LIKE A HUGE DIAMOND TWENTY-FIVE FEET LONG
IN SHORT A COMPLETE SERIES OF ALGAE
THEN HIS OPERATIONS FINISHED HE WENT AND LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE BEACON HOUSING HIS EYES STRAYING OVER THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
WHAT BEINGS LIVED INSIDE THIS STRANGE BOAT
IN A FEW SECONDS WE WERE SAFE ON TOP OF THE CAVE
OR WAS IT ONE OF THE FRIGATE'S LONGBOATS HAILING US OUT OF THE GLOOM
TWICE I WENT TO THE LOUNGE
TOO MANY THOUGHTS HAD PILED UP IN MY MIND TOO MANY INSOLUBLE QUESTIONS HAD ARISEN TOO MANY IMAGES WERE KEEPING MY EYELIDS OPEN
OUT OF THESE TRUNKS AND KEGS SPILLED INGOTS OF GOLD AND SILVER CASCADES OF JEWELS PIECES OF EIGHT
A SUDDEN INSIGHT INTO CAPTAIN NEMO'S PLANS HAD JUST FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND
HERE ON THESE BEACHES AND WATERS SAYS THE FRENCH HISTORIAN MICHELET A MAN IS REVIVED BY ONE OF THE MOST INVIGORATING CLIMATES IN THE WORLD
HELP I SHOUTED SWIMMING DESPERATELY TOWARD THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
THIS IS THE FIGURE FOR MAJOR STORMS
WHAT A SCENE
WHAT A SCENE
CONSEQUENTLY NOTHING INDICATED ANY FORTHCOMING IMPROVEMENT IN OUR SITUATION AND I SERIOUSLY WONDERED IF WE WERE DOOMED TO SPEND THE REST OF OUR LIVES IN THIS CAGE
THE LIQUID SETTING ELECTRICALLY LIT UNFOLDED WITH PERFECT CLARITY THROUGH THE WIDE-OPEN PANELS
WOULD HE PULL NEARER TO THE BEACHES OF EUROPE
DURING THE EASTERLY MONSOON SEASON BIRDS OF PARADISE LOSE THE MAGNIFICENT FEATHERS AROUND THEIR TAILS THAT NATURALISTS CALL BELOW-THE-WING FEATHERS
MILE AFTER MILE IT WAS GROWING THINNER
AN ENORMOUS MASS WAS SINKING BENEATH THE WATERS AND THE NAUTILUS MISSING NONE OF ITS DEATH THROES WAS DESCENDING INTO THE DEPTHS WITH IT
I NO LONGER WANTED TO THINK
AND YET TO ME HE DIDN'T HAVE THE FEEL OF A FELLOW COUNTRYMAN
THEREFORE HE SAID TO ME TO BUILD THESE WALLS IT TOOK 192,000 YEARS MY GALLANT CONSEIL WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY EXTENDS THE BIBLICAL DAYS OF CREATION
THE LATTER WOULD BE INEFFECTUAL
LIKE THE FLOCKS OF OLD PROTEUS KING NEPTUNE'S SHEPHERD MY HERDS GRAZE WITHOUT FEAR ON THE OCEAN'S IMMENSE PRAIRIES
ONE DAY WE WERE CHASED BY THE LONGBOATS OF A WHALING VESSEL WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY VIEWED US AS SOME ENORMOUS BALEEN WHALE OF GREAT VALUE
WITH SOME JUSTICE FISHERMEN'S YARNS AREN'T TO BE TRUSTED BUT HERE'S WHAT A FEW OF THEM RELATE
BUT JUST THEN THE RENOWNED FRENCH EXPLORER CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE UNAWARE OF DILLON'S ACTIVITIES HAD ALREADY SET SAIL TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE FOR THE SITE OF THE SHIPWRECK
CAPTAIN NEMO ALREADY KNEW THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS QUESTION AND IT AMUSED HIM TO SEE YOU FLYING OFF INTO IMPOSSIBLE FANTASIES
AND WHO HASN'T MADE THE SAME BLUNDER
THE HOURS STRUCK TOO SLOWLY TO KEEP UP WITH MY IMPATIENCE
CONSEIL RETURNED TO HIS CABIN
BESIDES HE SEEMED SILENT AND PREOCCUPIED
I CLIMBED ITS METAL STEPS PASSED THROUGH THE OPEN HATCHES AND ARRIVED TOPSIDE ON THE NAUTILUS
ACCORDING TO THE LATIN HISTORIANS CASSIODORUS AND PLINY BY THE YEAR 19 OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA A NEW ISLAND THE DIVINE THERA HAD ALREADY APPEARED IN THE VERY PLACE THESE ISLETS HAVE MORE RECENTLY FORMED
THE DERANGED NEEDLES WOULD MARK CONTRADICTORY DIRECTIONS AS WE APPROACHED THE SOUTHERN MAGNETIC POLE WHICH DOESN'T COINCIDE WITH THE SOUTH POLE PROPER
I GOT OUT CONSEIL AT MY HEELS LEAVING THE TWO MEN IN THE SKIFF
CONSEIL MADE ONE FINAL EFFORT AND BRACING HIS HANDS ON MY SHOULDERS WHILE I OFFERED RESISTANCE WITH ONE SUPREME EXERTION HE RAISED HIMSELF HALF OUT OF THE WATER THEN FELL BACK EXHAUSTED
THEY UTTERED OUTLANDISH CALLS AND PARTICIPATED IN NUMEROUS PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES THAT FEATURED MUCH NOISE BUT LITTLE ACTION
THE VALVES WERE CHARGED
THE POLES WERE QUASHED WITH A VIOLENCE THAT APPALLED NOT ONLY VERNE BUT ALL EUROPE
ALONG THE COASTS OF YOUR CONTINENTS OR ISLANDS SHOW ME ANY OFFSHORE MOORING THAT CAN EQUAL THIS SAFE REFUGE FOR WITHSTANDING THE FURY OF HURRICANES INDEED I REPLIED HERE YOU'RE IN PERFECT SAFETY CAPTAIN NEMO
AN UNUSUAL ASSORTMENT OF DEVILFISH I TOLD HIM AS CAREFREE AS A COLLECTOR IN FRONT OF AN AQUARIUM
AND IF YOU AREN'T CRUSHED BY SO MUCH PRESSURE IT'S BECAUSE THE AIR PENETRATES THE INTERIOR OF YOUR BODY WITH EQUAL PRESSURE
BUT NO MATTER HOW POWERFUL AND WELL ARMED THEY WERE NEITHER THEIR TAILS OR THEIR TUSKS COULD PUNCTURE THE SHEET-IRON PLATES OF A STEAMER EVEN SO NED PEOPLE MENTION VESSELS THAT NARWHALE TUSKS HAVE RUN CLEAN THROUGH WOODEN SHIPS MAYBE THE CANADIAN REPLIED
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I'LL BE EXTREMELY DISTRESSED TO SEE THE END OF A VOYAGE SO FEW MEN WILL EVER HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE BUT DON'T YOU REALIZE PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CANADIAN REPLIED THAT SOON WE'LL HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED FOR THREE WHOLE MONTHS ABOARD THIS NAUTILUS NO NED I DIDN'T REALIZE IT I DON'T WANT TO REALIZE IT AND I DON'T KEEP TRACK OF EVERY DAY AND EVERY HOUR BUT WHEN WILL IT BE OVER IN ITS APPOINTED TIME
CAPTAIN NEMO WALKED IN FRONT AND HIS COMPANION FOLLOWED US A FEW STEPS TO THE REAR
THEN WHEN THE OPERATION WAS OVER WE BURNED EVERY TRACE OF OUR STAY ON THAT ISLET WHICH IF I COULD HAVE I'D HAVE BLOWN UP FROM ALL THIS MAY I ASSUME THAT SUCH A BOAT COSTS A FORTUNE AN IRON SHIP PROFESSOR ARONNAX RUNS 1,125 FRANCS PER METRIC TON
AFTER LEAVING THIS GULF WE RAISED MUSCAT FOR AN INSTANT THE MOST IMPORTANT TOWN IN THE COUNTRY OF OMAN
FORMERLY I LOVED ACQUIRING THESE BEAUTIFUL WORKS CREATED BY THE HAND OF MAN
I WAS SWIMMING IN PERSPIRATION I WAS STIFLING I WAS ABOUT TO BE COOKED
EVEN TODAY AS I WRITE THESE LINES MY SENSATIONS ARE SO INTENSE THAT AN INVOLUNTARY TERROR SWEEPS OVER ME AND MY LUNGS STILL SEEM SHORT OF AIR
AND THEN WITH NO WAY TO RENEW OUR AIR SUPPLY
I WAS GLUED TO THE WINDOW BY AN IRRESISTIBLE ALLURE
THE VESSEL HADN'T STIRRED BECAUSE I OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE FELT ITS HULL VIBRATING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE PROPELLER
SO WE WERE NEVER LACKING IN PROVISIONS OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY WHICH THE NAUTILUS'S SPEED AND THE ALLURE OF ITS ELECTRIC LIGHT COULD CONTINUALLY REPLENISH
WITHOUT GETTING INTO THOSE RUMORS THAT UPSET CIVILIANS IN THE SEAPORTS AND DERANGED THE PUBLIC MIND EVEN FAR INLAND IT MUST BE SAID THAT PROFESSIONAL SEAMEN WERE ESPECIALLY ALARMED
THE DARING CYRUS FIELD WHO HAD RISKED HIS WHOLE FORTUNE TO PROMOTE THIS UNDERTAKING CALLED FOR A NEW BOND ISSUE
AND DESPITE THE MENU NED LAND DIDN'T WASTE A BITE
SEPARATING US FROM THE OPEN AIR WAS A MERE TRACT OF ICE
DID THIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE INDIVIDUAL THINK I HAD DETECTED SOME SECRET FORBIDDEN TO GUESTS ON THE NAUTILUS
THE NAUTILUS IS NEARING LONG ISLAND
AT 10:35 CAPTAIN NEMO LEFT THE STEERING WHEEL AND TURNED TO ME
HAD HE LET HIMSELF GET CARRIED AWAY PAST THE BOUNDS OF HIS HABITUAL RESERVE
EVEN SO HE WENT ON CAPTAIN NEMO CAN'T GO SOUTH FOREVER
WE WEREN'T THE CAUSE OF THE CREW'S CONCERN
SO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE ARRIVAL OF A STEAMBOAT THAT PROVIDES BIMONTHLY SERVICE FROM NORTH CAPE
ONLY THANKS TO THE NATIONALITY OF THE SHIP VICTIMIZED BY THIS NEW RAMMING AND THANKS TO THE REPUTATION OF THE COMPANY TO WHICH THIS SHIP BELONGED THE EVENT CAUSED AN IMMENSE UPROAR
MIXED WITH MERCURY IT FORMS AN AMALGAM THAT TAKES THE PLACE OF ZINC IN BUNSEN CELLS
I CAN EASILY BELIEVE IT NED JUST AS I CAN BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN BALEEN WHALES EQUAL 100 ELEPHANTS IN BULK
MY LUNGS WERE GASPING IN THEIR QUEST FOR THAT ENKINDLING ELASTIC FLUID REQUIRED FOR BREATHING NOW GROWING SCARCER AND SCARCER
THEY FOUND IT ACCURATE IN DETAIL BUT DEFICIENT IN IMPACT
THOSE ANIMALS ARE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE GENUS BALAENOPTERA FURNISHED WITH DORSAL FINS AND LIKE SPERM WHALES THEY'RE GENERALLY SMALLER THAN THE BOWHEAD WHALE OH EXCLAIMED THE CANADIAN WHOSE EYES HADN'T LEFT THE OCEAN
IT WAS AN ARDUOUS CLIMB OVER SHARP LAVA AND PUMICE STONES IN THE MIDST OF AIR OFTEN REEKING WITH SULFUROUS FUMES FROM THE SMOKE HOLES
CAPTAIN NEMO ALERTED HIS COMPANION TO THIS HIDEOUS CRUSTACEAN WHICH A SWING OF THE RIFLE BUTT QUICKLY BROUGHT DOWN AND I WATCHED THE MONSTER'S HORRIBLE LEGS WRITHING IN DREADFUL CONVULSIONS
ABOUT 106 METERS
ABOUT 106 METERS
I COULD HEAR SCRATCHINGS AND SCRAPINGS
ITS WAVES MADE THE NAUTILUS ROLL AND JERK VIOLENTLY
IN THE SECOND PLACE BECAUSE OXYGEN IS THE BASIS OF LIFE AND WE KNOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN DISSOLVED IN SALT WATER INCREASES RATHER THAN DECREASES WITH DEPTH THAT THE PRESSURE IN THESE LOWER STRATA HELPS TO CONCENTRATE THEIR OXYGEN CONTENT OHO
I MEAN THE GULF STREAM
BUT AFTER FIFTEEN METERS THE INSTRUMENTS WERE STILL IMPEDED BY THE THICKNESS OF THOSE WALLS
THIS CHASE DRAGGED ON FOR ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR WITHOUT THE FRIGATE GAINING TWO FATHOMS ON THE CETACEAN
FROM THERE OUR EYES SCANNED A VAST SEA WHICH SCRAWLED ITS BOUNDARY LINE FIRMLY AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE NORTHERN SKY
I STARED AT THE PRESSURE GAUGE
THERE I FOUND MY SUPPER READY
IT WAS HEADING TOWARD THE NAUTILUS AND YOU COULD TELL IT HAD PUT ON STEAM
A FEW SAILING SHIPS LADEN FOR THE EAST INDIES WERE HEADING TOWARD THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE
OFTEN THESE POWERFUL ANIMALS RUSHED AT THE LOUNGE WINDOW WITH A VIOLENCE LESS THAN COMFORTING
HE GREETED MY ANNOUNCEMENT WITH THE USUAL AS MASTER WISHES AND I HAD TO BE CONTENT WITH THAT
FOR MY PART I DIDN'T WANT MY NEW AND UNUSUAL RESEARCH TO BE BURIED WITH MY BONES
AT THIS TOPMOST LEVEL THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM BEGAN TO CHALLENGE THE MINERAL KINGDOM
ONE MORNING--WHOSE DATE I'M UNABLE TO SPECIFY--I WAS SLUMBERING NEAR THE FIRST HOURS OF DAYLIGHT A PAINFUL SICKLY SLUMBER
HIS FACIAL FEATURES USUALLY SO EMOTIONLESS REVEALED A CERTAIN UNEASINESS
THE FISH ED
IT LAY WELL OUT A GOOD LEAGUE FROM THE COAST WHICH WAS CROWNED BY A SHARP PEAK 400 TO 500 METERS HIGH
FINALLY AT AROUND FOUR O'CLOCK THIS MARVELOUS EXCURSION CAME TO AN END
SOME EXTREMELY INCONVENIENT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE BROUGHT YOU INTO THE PRESENCE OF A MAN WHO HAS CUT HIMSELF OFF FROM HUMANITY
AND WITH THAT THE GALLANT LAD WENT AWAY
FOR SEVERAL DAYS OUR WORK HOURS WERE SPENT IN ALL SORTS OF EXPERIMENTS ON THE DEGREE OF SALINITY IN WATERS OF DIFFERENT DEPTHS OR ON THEIR ELECTRIC PROPERTIES COLORATION AND TRANSPARENCY AND IN EVERY INSTANCE CAPTAIN NEMO DISPLAYED AN INGENUITY EQUALED ONLY BY HIS GRACIOUSNESS TOWARD ME
I TOLD MY COMPANIONS WHAT HAD HAPPENED
COULD ITS TRANSMISSION HAVE BEEN IMMEASURABLY INCREASED BY SOME UNKNOWN SYSTEM OF LEVERS THIS WAS THE POINT I COULDN'T GRASP
AMONG THE MACRURA WHICH ARE SUBDIVIDED INTO FIVE FAMILIES
HIS FACIAL APPEARANCE WAS CHANGING BY THE DAY
NED LAND WHISTLED YANKEE DOODLE BETWEEN HIS TEETH STUFFED HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND TURNED HIS BACK ON US
DURING HIS EGYPTIAN CAMPAIGN YOUR GENERAL NAPOLEON BONAPARTE DISCOVERED TRACES OF THIS OLD CANAL IN THE SUEZ DESERT AND WHEN THE TIDE CAUGHT HIM BY SURPRISE HE WELLNIGH PERISHED JUST A FEW HOURS BEFORE REJOINING HIS REGIMENT AT HADJAROTH THE VERY PLACE WHERE MOSES HAD PITCHED CAMP 3,300 YEARS BEFORE HIM WELL CAPTAIN WHAT THE ANCIENTS HESITATED TO UNDERTAKE MR DE LESSEPS IS NOW FINISHING UP
THE UNCHANGING VOLUME OF ITS WATERS IS GREATER THAN THAT OF ALL THE WORLD'S RIVERS COMBINED
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO LOCATE SOME PRECISE SPOT IN THE OCEAN
WOULD I FIND A WHOLE COLONY OF EXILES DOWN HERE MEN TIRED OF THE WORLD'S WOES MEN WHO HAD SOUGHT AND FOUND INDEPENDENCE IN THE OCEAN'S LOWER DEPTHS
BY NINE O'CLOCK WE HAD PULLED UP TO SHORE
SUDDENLY THROUGH TWO OBLONG OPENINGS DAYLIGHT APPEARED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE LOUNGE
IN FRANCE I HAD PUBLISHED A TWO-VOLUME WORK IN QUARTO ENTITLED THE MYSTERIES OF THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS
THAT THE FIRST CLASS FEATURES THE CEPHALOPODA WHOSE MEMBERS ARE SOMETIMES NAKED SOMETIMES COVERED WITH A SHELL WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO FAMILIES THE DIBRANCHIATA AND THE TETRABRANCHIATA WHICH ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR NUMBER OF GILLS
THE COMMON SPONGE
I GATHERED MY NOTES AND PACKED THEM TENDERLY ABOUT MY PERSON
THE ARAB IDRISI REFERRING TO IT BY THE NAME GULF OF COLZOUM RELATES THAT SHIPS PERISHED IN LARGE NUMBERS ON ITS SANDBANKS AND THAT NO ONE RISKED NAVIGATING IT BY NIGHT
A FEW SEAMEN STAYED VOLUNTARILY IN VANIKORO
QUINTO CONSEIL SAID THE LOPHOBRANCHIANS WHICH HAVE FULLY FORMED FREE-MOVING JAWS BUT WHOSE GILLS CONSIST OF LITTLE TUFTS ARRANGED IN PAIRS ALONG THEIR GILL ARCHES
I FANCIED I SAW THESE CYLINDRICAL MEMBRANE-FILLED TUBES TREMBLING BENEATH THE WATER'S UNDULATIONS
THE NAUTILUS SLOWLY SETTLED AND RESTED ON THE ICY BOTTOM AT A DEPTH OF 350 METERS THE DEPTH AT WHICH THE LOWER SHELF OF ICE LAY SUBMERGED
CONSEIL WILL NEVER WANT TO COME ALONG AND THAT'LL BE MY EXCUSE FOR NOT GOING WITH THE CAPTAIN AS FOR NED LAND I ADMIT I FELT LESS CONFIDENT OF HIS WISDOM
LASTLY ON JANUARY 12 1842 WITH HIS SHIPS THE EREBUS AND THE TERROR THE ENGLISHMAN SIR JAMES CLARK ROSS FOUND VICTORIA LAND IN LATITUDE 70 DEGREES 56 AND LONGITUDE 171 DEGREES 7 EAST
WE TOOK LONG STRIDES HELPED BY OUR ALPENSTOCKS
LASTLY THE BOOK HAS STATURE AS A NOVEL OF CHARACTER
ALL IN ALL IT'S ESTIMATED THAT 9,000,000 FRANCS IS THE CURRENT YEARLY RETURN FOR THE WHOLE PEARL-HARVESTING INDUSTRY BUT CONSEIL ASKED HAVEN'T CERTAIN FAMOUS PEARLS BEEN QUOTED AT EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES YES MY BOY
BUT NED LAND HAD NO IDEA IN HIS HEAD OTHER THAN TO SEE IF THIS CAVERN OFFERED SOME WAY OUT
I'LL LET THE READER DECIDE WHICH OF THESE DEEDS WAS MORE BENEFICIAL TO HUMANITY
AFTER EMERGING FROM CHANNELS OFF FLORIDA IT HEADS TOWARD SPITZBERGEN
BEYOND HIS SPELLS ON WATCH HE PRETENDED THAT HE NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES AT LEAST WHILE NO WHALES WERE IN SIGHT
THE GROUND ROSE APPRECIABLY AS IT MOVED AWAY FROM THE SAND FLATS BY THE WAVES AND WE SOON ARRIVED AT SOME LONG WINDING GRADIENTS GENUINELY STEEP PATHS THAT ALLOWED US TO CLIMB LITTLE BY LITTLE
YELLOW-TAILED GILTHEAD WHOSE FLESH IS EXTREMELY DAINTY AND WHOSE PHOSPHORESCENT PROPERTIES GIVE THEM AWAY IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS
I'LL HEAR HIS HARROWING PLEA THE REST OF MY LIFE
WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ACQUIESCE
THEN WITH HIS HANDS HE RAISED THE FRINGED MEMBRANE-FILLED TUNIC THAT MADE UP THE ANIMAL'S MANTLE
LET THIS FIRST TIME YOU'VE COME TO DISCUSS THIS SUBJECT ALSO BE THE LAST BECAUSE A SECOND TIME I WON'T EVEN LISTEN I WITHDREW
YOU'RE COMPLAINING ALL THIS VEGETATION DOESN'T MAKE A MEAL NED REPLIED
WHICH TOLD ME PRETTY CLEARLY THAT NOTHING WOULD EVER FORCE HIM TO SET FOOT ON A LAND MASS AGAIN
THE DIVER ANSWERED WITH HIS HAND IMMEDIATELY SWAM UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND DIDN'T REAPPEAR
MY EYES SOON GREW ACCUSTOMED TO THIS COMPARATIVE GLOOM
DURING THOSE TWO DAYS OF APRIL 11-12 THE NAUTILUS DIDN'T LEAVE THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND ITS TRAWL BROUGHT UP A SIMPLY MIRACULOUS CATCH OF ZOOPHYTES FISH AND REPTILES
VALUABLE RESERVES PREPARED BY FARSEEING NATURE FOR THAT TIME WHEN MAN WILL HAVE EXHAUSTED HIS MINES ON THE CONTINENTS
CAN'T BE THE CANADIAN REPLIED BECAUSE THIS ONE'S COMPLETE WHILE THE OTHER ONE LOST ITS TAIL THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FOLLOW I SAID
IF MASTER'S LEGS WOULD KINDLY ADOPT A WIDER STANCE MASTER WILL KEEP HIS BALANCE ARRIVING AT THE TOPMOST RIDGE OF THIS PROMONTORY I COULD SEE VAST WHITE PLAINS COVERED WITH WALRUSES
IN MASTER'S MUSEUM
HE RAN OFF HOWLING IN TERROR AND WILDLY PRANCING AROUND
BUT WHENEVER THE NAUTILUS DREW NEAR THE SURFACE THOSE DENIZENS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN I COULD OBSERVE MOST PRODUCTIVELY BELONGED TO THE SIXTY-THIRD GENUS OF BONY FISH
I STILL WAITED FOR A WHILE THEN I MADE MY WAY TO THE MAIN LOUNGE
AND I FOUND IT MORE OR LESS APPROPRIATE THAT THE FRENCH WORD FOR SHARK REQUIN HAS ITS LINGUISTIC ROOTS IN THE WORD REQUIEM
DANGEROUS NED LAND REPLIED
WELL THEN WE'LL ENTER THAT ATLANTIC OCEAN WITH WHICH WE AREN'T YET FAMILIAR
A FEW LICHENS OF THE SPECIES USNEA MELANOXANTHRA SPRAWLED OVER THE BLACK ROCKS
YOU CAN CLIMB ABOUT 100 FEET UP THE INNER BASE OF THIS MOUNTAIN BUT THEN THE WALLS OVERHANG THEY LEAN TOO FAR IN TO BE SCALED I CAN SEE CAPTAIN THAT NATURE IS YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT ANY TIME OR ANY PLACE
THE CAPTAIN WITH WHOM I WAS STROLLING ON THE PLATFORM ASKED ME IF I KNEW HOW SALT WATER DIFFERS IN DENSITY FROM SEA TO SEA
AND NOW PROFESSOR ARONNAX OUR OWN BREAKFAST IS READY
IN THE WORLD OF COMMERCE HE CELEBRATES THE HIGH-ENERGY ENTREPRENEURS WHO LAY THE ATLANTIC CABLE OR DIG THE SUEZ CANAL
IT LOOKED LIKE A HUGE REEF STRANDED IN MIDOCEAN
FOUR THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE PACIFIC 91 19
SO IT WAS NOW URGENT TO RENEW THE AIR IN OUR PRISON AND NO DOUBT THE AIR IN THIS WHOLE UNDERWATER BOAT AS WELL
I HOISTED AND ATTACHED MYSELF TO THE SAME PLACE DIVIDING MY WONDERMENT BETWEEN THE STORM AND THIS INCOMPARABLE MAN WHO FACED IT HEAD-ON
WHAT AN INDESCRIBABLE SIGHT
IF ONLY I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SHARE WITH CONSEIL THE INTENSE SENSATIONS RISING IN MY BRAIN COMPETING WITH HIM IN EXCLAMATIONS OF WONDERMENT
THE FURNACES WERE STOKED
BUT INSTEAD OF THE BROAD DAYLIGHT I WAS EXPECTING I FOUND THAT I WAS SURROUNDED BY TOTAL DARKNESS
CONCENTRIC COMB SHELLS HAMMER SHELLS COQUINA SEASHELLS THAT ACTUALLY HOP AROUND TOP-SHELL SNAILS RED HELMET SHELLS ANGEL-WING CONCHS SEA HARES AND SO MANY OTHER EXHIBITS FROM THIS INEXHAUSTIBLE OCEAN
BUT AS FAR AS I COULD I WANTED TO PROTECT MY PROFESSORIAL DIGNITY AND NOT LAY MYSELF OPEN TO LAUGHTER FROM THE AMERICANS WHO WHEN THEY DO LAUGH LAUGH RAUCOUSLY
WAS IT UNINTENTIONALLY THAT THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN HUNTED ME ON EVERY SEA
IT SOLD OUT IMMEDIATELY
WAS IT IN THE EXTRAORDINARY VOLTAGE OBTAINED FROM SOME NEW KIND OF INDUCTION COIL
PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE ANSWERED ME I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF FEARSOME CREATURE I'M UP AGAINST AND I DON'T WANT MY FRIGATE RUNNING FOOLISH RISKS IN ALL THIS DARKNESS
THAT DIAL HANGING BEFORE OUR EYES INDICATES HOW FAST THE NAUTILUS IS GOING
NO NATURALIST NEITHER CUVIER NOR LACéPèDE NEITHER PROFESSOR DUMERIL NOR PROFESSOR DE QUATREFAGES WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A MONSTER SIGHT UNSEEN SPECIFICALLY UNSEEN BY THEIR OWN SCIENTIFIC EYES
THE DIET ON BOARD AGREED WITH US PERFECTLY AND FOR MY PART I COULD EASILY HAVE GONE WITHOUT THOSE CHANGES OF PACE THAT NED LAND IN A SPIRIT OF PROTEST KEPT TAXING HIS INGENUITY TO SUPPLY US
IT CONSISTED OF A LONG LEAN FILAMENT THAT SPREAD OUT INTO COUNTLESS BRANCHES AND ENDED IN THE MOST DELICATE LACE EVER SPUN BY THE FOLLOWERS OF ARACHNE
BUT AS FOR YOUR ENCOUNTER WITH THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN PROFESSOR THAT TROUBLED ME BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SHIPS IN THE GALLANT AMERICAN NAVY BUT THEY ATTACKED ME AND I HAD TO DEFEND MYSELF
PARDON ME SIR I WENT ON BUT THAT'S MERELY THE FREEDOM THAT EVERY PRISONER HAS THE FREEDOM TO PACE HIS CELL
IF CAPTAIN NEMO WAS IN HIS STATEROOM HE MIGHT SEE ME
UNDER THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF WIND AND 400-HORSEPOWER STEAM IT WAS TRAVELING AT A SPEED OF THIRTEEN KNOTS
PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO WENT ON IF YOU'RE AMENABLE WE'LL GO BACK IN TIME TO 1702
THEY'RE MY LAST MEMENTOS OF THOSE SHORES THAT ARE NOW DEAD FOR ME
HIS EYES STAYED STUBBORNLY FOCUSED ON THAT INSCRUTABLE POINT OF THE HORIZON
I REALIZED THE NAUTILUS HAD COME TO REST ON THE OCEAN FLOOR
THE ANIMAL CAUGHT UP WITH US PLAYED WITH US
YES SIR BUT CAPTAIN YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS SPEED OF MOVEMENT THAT DOESN'T SQUARE WITH THE STRENGTH OF ELECTRICITY
I'VE HAD IT DIVIDED INTO TWENTY-FOUR HOURS LIKE ITALIAN CLOCKS SINCE NEITHER DAY NOR NIGHT SUN NOR MOON EXIST FOR ME BUT ONLY THIS ARTIFICIAL LIGHT THAT I IMPORT INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE SEAS
VOICES WERE ANSWERING EACH OTHER HURRIEDLY
THE NEXT MORNING FEBRUARY 11 THE NAUTILUS'S PANTRY WAS ENRICHED BY MORE DAINTY GAME
THIS WAS THE EXTENT OF HIS EQUIPMENT
A HUNDRED TIMES I CHIDED HIM FOR HIS UNCONCERN
THIS DREADFUL EXECUTIONER THIS TRUE ARCHANGEL OF HATE WAS STILL STARING
A CORAL IS A UNIT OF TINY ANIMALS ASSEMBLED OVER A POLYPARY THAT'S BRITTLE AND STONY IN NATURE
ON FEBRUARY 10 1828 THE NEW ASTROLABE HOVE BEFORE TIKOPIA ISLAND TOOK ON A GUIDE AND INTERPRETER IN THE PERSON OF A DESERTER WHO HAD SETTLED THERE PLIED A COURSE TOWARD VANIKORO RAISED IT ON FEBRUARY 12 SAILED ALONG ITS REEFS UNTIL THE 14TH AND ONLY ON THE 20TH DROPPED ANCHOR INSIDE ITS BARRIER IN THE HARBOR OF VANA
SALTS PLAY A LEADING ROLE THE ROLE OF STABILIZER FOR THE GENERAL ECOLOGY OF THE GLOBE CAPTAIN NEMO STOPPED STRAIGHTENED UP TOOK A FEW STEPS ALONG THE PLATFORM AND RETURNED TO ME
THE NAUTILUS LAY MOTIONLESS NEITHER ROLLING NOR PITCHING
THERE HIGH UNDERWATER CLIFFS REARED UP STRAIGHT WALLS MADE OF CRAGGY CHUNKS ARRANGED LIKE BIG STONE FOUNDATIONS AMONG WHICH THERE GAPED BLACK CAVES SO DEEP OUR ELECTRIC RAYS COULDN'T LIGHT THEM TO THE FAR ENDS
WELL NED MY FRIEND WE'LL SERENELY WAIT FOR THE TIDE ON THE 9TH BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE MOON WILL HAVE THE GOOD NATURE TO FLOAT US AWAY AS SIMPLE AS THAT AS SIMPLE AS THAT SO OUR CAPTAIN ISN'T GOING TO DROP HIS ANCHORS PUT HIS ENGINES ON THE CHAINS AND DO ANYTHING TO HAUL US OFF SINCE THE TIDE WILL BE SUFFICIENT CONSEIL REPLIED SIMPLY
HIS GRIEF WAS IMMENSE
IT WAS A DAZZLING MINE OF GEMS IN PARTICULAR SAPPHIRES AND EMERALDS WHOSE JETS OF BLUE AND GREEN CRISSCROSSED
THE WATER STRUCK ME AS UNUSUALLY COLD BUT I WARMED UP PROMPTLY WHILE WIELDING MY PICK
WHEN THE DEVICE IS OPERATING THIS GAS BECOMES LUMINOUS AND GIVES OFF A CONTINUOUS WHITISH LIGHT
BUT HE FARED SO WELL THE ANIMAL WENT INTO HIS SACK TO JOIN THE HONEYCOMBS
WITH ONE VIGOROUS STROKE OF ITS FINS THE VORACIOUS ANIMAL SHOT TOWARD THE INDIAN WHO JUMPED ASIDE AND AVOIDED THE SHARK'S BITE BUT NOT THE THRASHING OF ITS TAIL BECAUSE THAT TAIL STRUCK HIM ACROSS THE CHEST AND STRETCHED HIM OUT ON THE SEAFLOOR
JUST THEN AS IF TO TAKE MY SIDE IN THE ARGUMENT A BUBBLING BEGAN ASTERN OF THIS STRANGE SUBMERSIBLE--WHOSE DRIVE MECHANISM WAS OBVIOUSLY A PROPELLER--AND THE BOAT STARTED TO MOVE
DEEP DOWN I WAS DETERMINED TO FULLY EXPLOIT THE GOOD FORTUNE THAT HAD PUT ME ON BOARD THE NAUTILUS
THE NEXT DAY MARCH 19 AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I WAS BACK AT MY POST IN THE LOUNGE
I ALSO SAW MYRIADS OF THOSE NORTHERNMOST SEA BUTTERFLIES THREE CENTIMETERS LONG WHICH A BALEEN WHALE CAN SWALLOW BY THE THOUSANDS IN ONE GULP
WE'RE PRIVY TO THE NAUTILUS'S SECRETS AND I DON'T EXPECT THAT ITS COMMANDER JUST TO SET US FREE WILL MEEKLY STAND BY WHILE WE SPREAD THOSE SECRETS ALL OVER THE WORLD BUT IN THAT CASE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THE CANADIAN ASKED
ANGLERFISH WHOSE COMICAL MOVEMENTS QUALIFY THEM FOR THE EPITHET CLOWNS BLACK COMMERSON ANGLERS EQUIPPED WITH THEIR ANTENNAS UNDULATING TRIGGERFISH ENCIRCLED BY LITTLE RED BANDS BLOATED PUFFERS WHOSE VENOM IS EXTREMELY INSIDIOUS SOME OLIVE-HUED LAMPREYS SNIPEFISH COVERED WITH SILVER SCALES CUTLASS FISH WHOSE ELECTROCUTING POWER EQUALS THAT OF THE ELECTRIC EEL AND THE ELECTRIC RAY SCALY FEATHERBACKS WITH BROWN CROSSWISE BANDS GREENISH CODFISH SEVERAL VARIETIES OF GOBY ETC
ITS CURRENTS ARE WIDE AND SLOW-MOVING ITS TIDES MODERATE ITS RAINFALL ABUNDANT
WOULD I EVER AGAIN HAVE SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE THE OCEAN'S WONDERS
JUST AS I PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR LEADING TO THE WELL OF THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY I HEARD THE HATCH CLOSE SHARPLY OVERHEAD
THE CAPTAIN AND HIS CHIEF OFFICER STAYED ON THE PLATFORM
I BOWED TO HIM
AND HERE'S WHY THESE WATER PLANTS COLLECT IN THIS PLACID ATLANTIC BASIN ACCORDING TO THE EXPERT ON THE SUBJECT COMMANDER MAURY AUTHOR OF THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE SEA
IT ADVANCED SWIFTLY THROUGH THIS NARROW PASSAGEWAY
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT FAR OFF WHEN I ESTIMATE ITS VALUE AT 2,000,000 UH FRANCS CONSEIL SAID QUICKLY
MY COMPANIONS AND I STOPPED WALKING AND TURNING AROUND I SAW THE CREWMEN FORM A SEMICIRCLE AROUND THEIR LEADER
THIS WAS LAND
JUST THEN NIGHT FELL SUDDENLY AND THE WAVES BARELY SURGED IN THE BREEZE SPREADING PLACIDLY AROUND THE NAUTILUS'S SIDE PLATES
WE MUSTN'T PUSH OUR LUCK AND EXPOSE THE NAUTILUS TOO LONG TO THESE PRESSURES LET'S GO BACK UP I REPLIED
TROUBLED DREAMS ED
TROUBLED DREAMS ED
IN ESSENCE HEAT CREATES THE DIFFERENT DENSITIES THAT LEAD TO CURRENTS AND COUNTERCURRENTS
BUT NO NOTHING BUT SILENCE AND DEATH FILLED THIS FIELD OF CATASTROPHES
A THOUSAND YEARS THE CANADIAN REPLIED WITHOUT HESITATION
SIR JUST WHAT IS A PEARL EXACTLY MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED FOR POETS A PEARL IS A TEAR FROM THE SEA
THEY WENT IN GROUPS OF FIVE OR SIX HUNTING IN PACKS LIKE WOLVES OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE
CHAPTER 8 MOBILIS IN MOBILI THIS BRUTALLY EXECUTED CAPTURE WAS CARRIED OUT WITH LIGHTNING SPEED
SIR I TOLD CAPTAIN NEMO TO YOU BELONGS THE HONOR OF FIRST SETTING FOOT ON THIS SHORE YES SIR THE CAPTAIN REPLIED AND IF I HAVE NO HESITATION IN TREADING THIS POLAR SOIL IT'S BECAUSE NO HUMAN BEING UNTIL NOW HAS LEFT A FOOTPRINT HERE SO SAYING HE LEAPED LIGHTLY ONTO THE SAND
IT'S RIGHT HERE HE WENT DOWN THE HATCH
THIS PIECE OF HISTORY CONCERNS YOU IN ONE DEFINITE RESPECT BECAUSE IT WILL ANSWER A QUESTION YOU'VE NO DOUBT BEEN UNABLE TO RESOLVE I'M LISTENING CAPTAIN I SAID NOT KNOWING WHAT MY PARTNER IN THIS DIALOGUE WAS DRIVING AT AND WONDERING IF THIS INCIDENT RELATED TO OUR ESCAPE PLANS
JUST A FEW LARGE FISH SWEEPING BY LIKE SHADOWS
THE PRESSURE GAUGE SOON INDICATED AN ASCENDING MOVEMENT
TURTLE LIVERS LOIN OF SHARK DOGFISH STEAKS WE'LL SOON FIND OUT CONSEIL SAID
I STOOD UP AND COULD CLEARLY OBSERVE THE CANADIAN'S ADVERSARY
AS FOR THE TEMPERATURE IN THESE LOWER STRATA THE THERMOMETER ALWAYS AND INVARIABLY INDICATED 4 DEGREES CENTIGRADE
YET EVERYONE STILL FELT CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS AND NOT A SAILOR ON BOARD WOULD HAVE BET AGAINST THE NARWHALE APPEARING AND SOON
THE CANADIAN'S LAST WORDS CAUSED A SUDDEN UPHEAVAL IN MY BRAIN
IT DID NOTHING OF THE SORT AND KEPT MOVING TOWARD THE SOUTHERNMOST REGIONS
A DOUBLE CURRENT RISING AND FALLING CONSTANT MOVEMENT CONSTANT LIFE
THIS EVENING WE'LL BE JUST A FEW MILES OFF THE COAST OF SPAIN
THIS HE CLAIMS IS A SEA SUBJECT TO FEARFUL HURRICANES STREWN WITH INHOSPITABLE ISLANDS AND WITH NOTHING GOOD TO OFFER EITHER ON ITS SURFACE OR IN ITS DEPTHS
NIGHT HAD ALREADY FALLEN BECAUSE IN THIS LOW LATITUDE THE SUN SETS QUICKLY WITHOUT ANY TWILIGHT
VESUVIUS OVER THE CITY LIMITS OF A SECOND TORRE DEL GRECO
BUT IN EXCHANGE I EXPERIENCED THAT IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE FOR SLEEP THAT COMES OVER EVERY DIVER
YOU COULD FEEL IT IN THE VIBRATIONS OF THE LONG STEEL HULL
I COULD OBSERVE THESE STRANGE WALLS QUITE CLOSELY
BUT NUMEROUS FIRES HAD BEEN KINDLED ON THE BEACH ATTESTING THAT THE NATIVES HAD NO THOUGHTS OF LEAVING IT
IT WASN'T JUST A RAILING THAT LED TO THE PLATFORM IT WAS A METAL CABLE FULLY CHARGED WITH THE SHIP'S ELECTRICITY
I WAS NO LONGER AN INERT MASS AND I HAD COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING GREAT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
BUT WE COULD SEE WELL ENOUGH TO FIND OUR WAY AND IT STILL WASN'T NECESSARY TO ACTIVATE THE RUHMKORFF DEVICE
MUCH BETTER THAN THOSE PAPUAN ISLANDS WHERE WE RAN INTO MORE SAVAGES THAN VENISON
IN GOING TOWARD THE OCEAN'S LOWER STRATA WE KNOW THAT VEGETABLE LIFE DISAPPEARS MORE QUICKLY THAN ANIMAL LIFE
SEVERAL TIMES WE USED OUR SLANTING FINS WHICH INTERNAL LEVERS COULD SET AT AN OBLIQUE ANGLE TO OUR WATERLINE
I HEARD ITS PLATING GRIND AGAINST THE LIMESTONE ROUGHNESS OF THAT CORAL BASE
THERE'S THE THING IN QUESTION ASTERN TO PORT THE HARPOONER SHOUTED
I LOOKED AT HIS INTELLIGENT HEAD FURROWED WITH PREMATURE WRINKLES THAT MISFORTUNE PERHAPS MISERY HAD ETCHED LONG BEFORE
ON JANUARY 16 THE NAUTILUS SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP JUST A FEW METERS BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
ASSUREDLY IF THE MONSTER EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH NED LAND'S HARPOON I WOULDN'T BET ON THE MONSTER
ON THIS ISLAND THERE ARE TREES
TO DISSECT IT CALLED FOR CATCHING IT
THE SHORES OF JAPAN WERE LESS THAN 200 MILES TO OUR LEEWARD
A FEW HAVE HEARD HOLLOW NOISES THAT ANNOUNCED SOME STRUGGLE OF THE ELEMENTS FAR BELOW OTHERS HAVE HAULED IN VOLCANIC ASH HURLED ABOVE THE WAVES
TEN MINUTES WENT BY
THEN THE PROPELLER WAS BROUGHT TO ITS MAXIMUM SPEED AND ITS FOUR BLADES CHURNED THE WAVES WITH INDESCRIBABLE VIOLENCE
IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO STAND UP ON THE PLATFORM WHICH WAS CONTINUOUSLY BUFFETED BY THIS ENORMOUSLY HEAVY SEA
IN FACT IF THEY DIDN'T PRODUCE THEIR OWN AIR THEY INEVITABLY HAD TO MAKE PERIODIC VISITS TO THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN TO REPLENISH THEIR OXYGEN SUPPLY
ALONG THE NARROW WALLS OF THIS PASSAGEWAY I SAW ONLY BRILLIANT STREAKS HARD LINES FIERY FURROWS ALL SCRAWLED BY OUR SPEEDING ELECTRIC LIGHT
WELL THEN WHEN YOU DIVE UNDER THE WAVES NED FOR EVERY THIRTY-TWO FEET OF WATER ABOVE YOU YOUR BODY IS TOLERATING THE PRESSURE OF ONE MORE ATMOSPHERE IN OTHER WORDS ONE MORE KILOGRAM PER EACH SQUARE CENTIMETER ON YOUR BODY'S SURFACE
BUT I HAD BARELY QUERIED CAPTAIN NEMO WHEN THE LATTER SILENCED ME
ZOOPHYTES ARTICULATES MOLLUSKS AND FISH
OUR FRIGATE WOULD HAVE HAD FIVESCORE GOOD REASONS FOR RENAMING ITSELF THE ARGUS AFTER THAT MYTHOLOGICAL BEAST WITH 100 EYES
BLOOD CLOTS HAD FORMED IN THIS DISSOLVING MASS TAKING ON THE COLOR OF WINE DREGS
THERE THE OBSESSIVE FEARS IN MY BRAIN LEFT ME
THE MEDITERRANEAN HE TOLD ME
WHAT SHIP WAS THIS
THE ESCORT OF BOATS AND TENDERS STILL FOLLOWED THE FRIGATE AND ONLY LEFT US WHEN WE CAME ABREAST OF THE LIGHTSHIP WHOSE TWO SIGNAL LIGHTS MARK THE ENTRANCE OF THE NARROWS TO UPPER NEW YORK BAY
A NATURAL REACTION AFTER THAT INTERMINABLE NIGHT OF FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES
BECAUSE IT TAKES INCALCULABLE STRENGTH JUST TO LIVE IN THOSE DEEP STRATA AND WITHSTAND THEIR PRESSURE OH REALLY NED SAID TIPPING ME A WINK
ME I'M OUT LIKE A LIGHT NED LAND REPLIED
WHILE I WAS CONTEMPLATING THIS INERT MASS SUDDENLY A DOZEN OF THESE VORACIOUS MELANOPTERA APPEARED AROUND OUR LONGBOAT
OBSERVING THE SEAFLOOR I SAW THAT IT SWELLED AT CERTAIN POINTS FROM LOW BULGES THAT WERE ENCRUSTED WITH LIMESTONE DEPOSITS AND ARRANGED WITH A SYMMETRY THAT BETRAYED THE HAND OF MAN
WHAT COULD HE BE LOOKING FOR OVER THAT IMMENSE EXPANSE
END OF THE SECOND PART
NO LONGER WAS IT AN ICE STREAM PATCH OR FIELD--IT WAS AN ENDLESS IMMOVABLE BARRIER FORMED BY ICE MOUNTAINS FUSED TO EACH OTHER
WHEN FISHERMEN FIRST HUNTED WHALES 400 YEARS AGO THESE ANIMALS GREW TO BIGGER SIZES THAN THEY DO TODAY
I FOLLOWED HIM WITH UNSHAKEABLE CONFIDENCE
HE SAW ME AND WITHOUT FURTHER PREAMBLE
HE OPENED HIS EYES
I LONGED TO REJOIN NED LAND AND URGE HIM TO POSTPONE HIS ATTEMPT
NEAR SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE NAUTILUS LAY HALF SUBMERGED NAVIGATING IN THE MIDST OF MILKY WHITE WAVES
THEY FIX THINGS SO THEY STAY THERE OF COURSE CONSEIL PUT IN
JUST THEN A SHELL HIT THE NAUTILUS'S HULL OBLIQUELY FAILED TO BREACH IT RICOCHETED NEAR THE CAPTAIN AND VANISHED INTO THE SEA
THAT FINE LAD PERSISTED IN SEEING THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER AS MERELY ONE OF THOSE UNAPPRECIATED SCIENTISTS WHO REPAY HUMANITY'S INDIFFERENCE WITH CONTEMPT
THE FARTHER DOWN SOUTH WE WENT THE MORE THESE FLOATING ISLANDS GREW IN NUMBERS AND PROMINENCE
THE FLOOR WAS BECOMING HORIZONTAL BENEATH OUR FEET
NO MATTER HOW FAINTLY IT SHINES IT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR ME THE CAPTAIN REPLIED
THEN THE CABLE WAS RESUBMERGED
NOW THEN THIS SECOND ARM--MORE ACCURATELY A COLLAR--FORMS A RING OF WARM WATER AROUND A SECTION OF COOL TRANQUIL MOTIONLESS OCEAN CALLED THE SARGASSO SEA
THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD CHANGE COURSE AND RACE AFTER THE ANIMAL SIGHTED ONLY TO FIND AN ORDINARY BALEEN WHALE OR A COMMON SPERM WHALE THAT SOON DISAPPEARED AMID A CHORUS OF CURSES
HIS FACIAL APPEARANCE SO PROFOUNDLY CHANGED NOW RESUMED ITS USUAL CALM
IN THESE MYSTERIOUS MARINE SANCTUARIES I ENVISIONED HOSTS OF UNKNOWN ANIMALS AND THIS UNDERWATER BOAT SEEMED TO BE A BLOOD RELATION OF THEIRS
BUT BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH THIS OPERATION I ASKED THE CAPTAIN FOR PERMISSION TO EXAMINE THE RIFLES SET ASIDE FOR US
NEAR EVENING ONE MORE METER HAD BEEN DUG FROM THE TRENCH
ITS HEAD WAS COMPARATIVELY SMALL AND ITS EYES PLACED NEAR THE OPENING OF ITS BEAK WERE ALSO SMALL
BUT HOW WILL WE REACH THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA RIGHT NOW PROFESSOR THE NAUTILUS IS AGROUND IN TEN METERS OF WATER AND WE'VE ONLY TO DEPART BUT HOW WILL WE SET OUT YOU'LL SEE CAPTAIN NEMO INSERTED HIS CRANIUM INTO ITS SPHERICAL HEADGEAR
THE COMMANDER'S WORDS HAD A TREMENDOUS EFFECT ON ME
THE CANADIAN REPORTED AT ONCE
THE DEVILFISH DOESN'T BELONG TO THE VERTEBRATE BRANCH AND EVEN IF IT WERE 500 FEET LONG IT WOULD STILL BE UTTERLY HARMLESS TO SHIPS LIKE THE SCOTIA OR THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
WE CAN CHAT WHILE WE EAT
BEFORE WE TACKLE THE TERRAIN IT HELPS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH IT ALL RIGHT SIT DOWN MY FRIENDS AND I'LL TEACH YOU EVERYTHING I MYSELF HAVE JUST BEEN TAUGHT BY THE ENGLISHMAN H
THESE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO TURN ON THEIR ASSAILANTS AND CAPSIZE THEIR LONGBOATS
IT CROSSES OCEANS LIKE SWALLOWS CROSS THE AIR OR EXPRESS TRAINS CONTINENTS
THAT GREAT LAKE SO FAMOUS IN BIBLICAL TRADITIONS SELDOM REPLENISHED BY RAINS FED BY NO IMPORTANT RIVERS CONTINUALLY DRAINED BY A HIGH RATE OF EVAPORATION ITS WATER LEVEL DROPPING A METER AND A HALF EVERY YEAR
THEN OUR CONVERSATION PETERED OUT AND EACH OF US WITHDREW INTO HIS OWN THOUGHTS
IN A FEW MINUTES WE WERE A GUNSHOT AWAY FROM THE COAST
GERMAN
GERMAN
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE STRAIT WAS GETTING NARROWER AND NARROWER
IT'S BLESSED WITH A TERRIFIC GIFT FOR GETTING AROUND
IT LEFT THIS PLACE OF DEVASTATION WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED 100 FEET BENEATH THE WATERS
SOON WE HAD CLEARED THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE PLUS THE PROMONTORY OF CAPE HORN
AMONG OTHER ZOOPHYTES PRESENT IN THESE SHALLOWS THERE WERE A FEW CORAL TREE FORMS THAT ACCORDING TO SIR JAMES CLARK ROSS LIVE IN THESE ANTARCTIC SEAS AT DEPTHS AS GREAT AS 1,000 METERS
I EXPECTED THESE LONG PLAINS TO CHANGE INTO MOUNTAIN REGIONS AND IN FACT AS THE NAUTILUS WAS EXECUTING CERTAIN TURNS I NOTICED THAT THE SOUTHERLY HORIZON WAS BLOCKED BY A HIGH WALL THAT SEEMED TO CLOSE OFF EVERY EXIT
WILL MASTER TELL ME WHAT THIS MEANS CONSEIL ASKED ME
SO HE KEPT A DEVOTED WATCH ON HIS FRIEND EVERY INSTANT
A SUPREME CHALLENGE HAD BEEN ISSUED TO THE GIANT NARWHALE AND THE LATTER HAD NO ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE FOR IGNORING THIS SUMMONS TO APPEAR
I WAS MISTAKEN AND AFTER A HASTY EXAMINATION I DISCOVERED MY ERROR
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LOUNGE A JET OF WATER ELECTRICALLY LIT FELL BACK INTO A BASIN MADE FROM A SINGLE GIANT CLAM
WHAT A FREAK OF NATURE
OVER TO YOU MR LAND
I DIDN'T PRONOUNCE A WORD
CHAPTER 14 THE BLACK CURRENT THE PART OF THE PLANET EARTH THAT THE SEAS OCCUPY HAS BEEN ASSESSED AT 3,832,558 SQUARE MYRIAMETERS HENCE MORE THAN 38,000,000,000 HECTARES
OUR VISIT TO THIS OPULENT GIANT CLAM CAME TO AN END
ITS MAXIMUM WIDTH 150 MILES
WHAT IS IT I ASKED
BY THEN I THOUGHT OUR EXPEDITION HAD COME TO AN END THAT WE WOULD NEVER SEE THIS FANTASTIC ANIMAL AGAIN
SO CONSEIL AND I WERE DEEP IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF OUR TREASURE AND I WAS SOLEMNLY PROMISING MYSELF TO ENRICH THE PARIS MUSEUM WITH IT WHEN AN ILL-TIMED STONE HURLED BY ONE OF THE ISLANDERS WHIZZED OVER AND SHATTERED THE VALUABLE OBJECT IN CONSEIL'S HANDS
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WHALES DURING THIS PERIOD
WHERE OTHERS HAVE FAILED I'LL SUCCEED
BESIDES THE SHIP HAD A GOOD STOCK OF THE MADREPORE DENDROPHYLIA KNOWN IN PROVENCE BY THE NAME SEA FENNEL AND A POULTICE MADE FROM THE DISSOLVED FLESH OF ITS POLYPS WILL FURNISH AN EXCELLENT COUGH MEDICINE
AND WHEN CONSEIL HAS SPOKEN THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO BE SAID
THE CANADIAN WAS NOT MISTAKEN
IT CONSISTS OF A BUNSEN BATTERY THAT I ACTIVATE NOT WITH POTASSIUM DICHROMATE BUT WITH SODIUM
SUDDENLY DAYLIGHT APPEARED IN THE LOUNGE
AND THE CANADIAN HAD SUCH GOOD LUCK THAT WITH A RIGHT-AND-LEFT SHOT HE HARPOONED NOT ONE WHALE BUT TWO STRIKING THE FIRST STRAIGHT TO THE HEART AND CATCHING THE OTHER AFTER A FEW MINUTES CHASE
THE ENGINEERS THEN PROCEEDED TO INSPECT THE SCOTIA WHICH HAD BEEN PUT IN DRY DOCK
A FEW ATOMS OF AIR WERE STILL LEFT IN THE DEPTHS OF ONE ROUQUAYROL DEVICE
THAT DAMNED CAPTAIN HAD TO CALL A HALT JUST AS WE WERE GOING TO ESCAPE FROM HIS BOAT YES NED HE HAD BUSINESS WITH HIS BANKERS HIS BANKERS OR RATHER HIS BANK VAULTS
HE GAVE HIS ORDERS
THE NEXT DAY FEBRUARY 7 WE ENTERED THE STRAIT OF BAB EL MANDEB WHOSE NAME MEANS GATE OF TEARS IN THE ARABIC LANGUAGE
IT WAS AS IF A COMPARATIVE SPRINGTIME HAD BEEN LOCKED UP BEHIND THAT ICE BANK WHOSE DISTANT MASSES WERE OUTLINED ON THE NORTHERN HORIZON
THE ARCHAEOTHERIUM HYRACOTHERIUM OREODONTS CHEIROPOTAMUS AND MASTER'S OTHER FOSSIL SKELETONS THE HOTEL WILL KEEP THEM FOR US WHAT ABOUT MASTER'S LIVE BABIRUSA THEY'LL FEED IT DURING OUR ABSENCE
HERE SEALS AND OTTERS COULD INDULGE IN A SUMPTUOUS MEAL MIXING MEAT FROM FISH WITH VEGETABLES FROM THE SEA LIKE THE ENGLISH WITH THEIR IRISH STEWS
I WENT TO MAN MY POST NEAR THE DOOR OPENING INTO THE WELL OF THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY
I CLUTCHED CONSEIL'S HAND
THAT'S MY FEELING IT WILL FINISH NED WHERE AND WHEN WHERE
IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND IF CAPTAIN NEMO FOUND CONDITIONS FAVORABLE FOR TAKING HIS SIGHTS I WANTED TO BE PRESENT AT THE OPERATION
THE POOR MAN WAS ABOUT TO BE CUT IN HALF
AT FIRST I MUST SAY EVENTS SEEMED TO CONFIRM MY FORECASTS MUCH TO THE CANADIAN'S DESPAIR
NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE SKIN COVERING THEM
FOR TWO MORE HOURS NED LAND'S RAGE INCREASED
OUR HOST HAD KEPT TO THE TERMS OF HIS AGREEMENT
BUT BY FORCING THE PACE OF ITS PROPELLER THE NAUTILUS CARRIED THEM OFF DRAGGED THEM UNDER OR BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE WATERS UNTROUBLED BY THEIR ENORMOUS WEIGHT OR THEIR POWERFUL GRIP
I BECAME SURPRISINGLY CALM AGAIN
FOR LONG HOURS THEY COMPETED IN SPEED WITH OUR SUBMERSIBLE
I WANT TO SEE WHAT NO MAN HAS SEEN YET EVEN IF I MUST PAY FOR THIS INSATIABLE CURIOSITY WITH MY LIFE
IN 1864 DURING EXPERIMENTS ON FISHING BY ELECTRIC LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NORTH SEA GLASS PANES LESS THAN SEVEN MILLIMETERS THICK WERE SEEN TO RESIST A PRESSURE OF SIXTEEN ATMOSPHERES ALL THE WHILE LETTING THROUGH STRONG HEAT-GENERATING RAYS WHOSE WARMTH WAS UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED
HAVE YOU GLIMPSED THE TOWNS BUILT ON ITS SHORES YES CAPTAIN NEMO I REPLIED AND THE NAUTILUS IS WONDERFULLY SUITED TO THIS WHOLE SURVEY
ON AUGUST 13 1778 COMMANDED BY LA POYPE-VERTRIEUX IT FOUGHT VALIANTLY AGAINST THE PRESTON
ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO ENCASE ONE'S HEAD IN ITS METAL SPHERE
AND FOR THE SAKE OF ARCHAEOLOGY LET'S HOPE THAT SOONER OR LATER SUCH EXCAVATIONS DO TAKE PLACE ONCE NEW TOWNS ARE SETTLED ON THE ISTHMUS AFTER THE SUEZ CANAL HAS BEEN CUT THROUGH A CANAL BY THE WAY OF LITTLE USE TO A SHIP SUCH AS THE NAUTILUS SURELY BUT OF GREAT USE TO THE WORLD AT LARGE CAPTAIN NEMO SAID
I SLEPT PRETTY POORLY
FROM THIS FACT HE DREW THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE MUST CONTAIN CONSIDERABLE SHORES SINCE ICEBERGS CAN'T FORM ON THE HIGH SEAS BUT ONLY ALONG COASTLINES
IT WAS A GREAT EMERALD ONE OF THE RAREST BIRDS OF PARADISE
BLANC WITHOUT ITS SUMMIT POKING ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
WHEN I TOLD THEM WE WOULD BE LYING IN MEDITERRANEAN WATERS WITHIN TWO DAYS CONSEIL CLAPPED HIS HANDS BUT THE CANADIAN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
BUT I'LL BET YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE CLASSIFIED SURE I DO THE HARPOONER REPLIED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS
BUT CAPTAIN NEMO CAME OVER AND STOPPED ME WITH A GESTURE
CAPTAIN NEMO OBSERVED THE HERD OF CETACEANS CAVORTING ON THE WATERS A MILE FROM THE NAUTILUS
DO YOU STILL MISS YOUR CUBANS SIR CAPTAIN I SCORN THEM FROM THIS DAY FORWARD THEN SMOKE THESE CIGARS WHENEVER YOU LIKE WITHOUT DEBATING THEIR ORIGIN
NO WHALING VESSEL COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER ARMED
HERE BY CONTRAST I HAVE ONLY TO PICK UP WHAT OTHER MEN HAVE LOST AND NOT ONLY IN THIS BAY OF VIGO BUT AT A THOUSAND OTHER SITES WHERE SHIPS HAVE GONE DOWN WHOSE POSITIONS ARE MARKED ON MY UNDERWATER CHART
OH MR LAND YOU'RE ADDICTED TO TALL TALES
TO MY DEEP ASTONISHMENT CAPTAIN NEMO GAVE HIM A SIGNAL
THIS ORDER INCLUDES ONLY ONE FAMILY
BUT WHY SHOULD I HAVE BEEN STARTLED BY THIS REPLY
THE TABLOIDS FOUND IT A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR HATCHING ALL SORTS OF HOAXES
SO LET'S FINISH WHAT WE'VE STARTED
INDEED IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO BEAT A RETREAT BECAUSE SOME TWENTY NATIVES ARMED WITH BOWS AND SLINGS APPEARED BARELY A HUNDRED PACES OFF ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF A THICKET THAT MASKED THE HORIZON TO OUR RIGHT
YOU'VE JUST STUMBLED ON A SECRET NO LIVING MAN MUST PROBE THE SECRET OF MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE
FOR SOME DAYS WE SAW A LARGE NUMBER OF AQUATIC BIRDS WITH WEBBED FEET KNOWN AS GULLS OR SEA MEWS
THE CAPTAIN THEN BROKE INTO SPEECH
BUT AS FOR OUR SITUATION WE'RE STILL IN THE DARK MASTER MUST LEARN PATIENCE SAID THE EMOTIONLESS CONSEIL
WAS HE DREAMING OF THOSE LOST GENERATIONS ASKING THEM FOR THE SECRET OF HUMAN DESTINY
INSTEAD OF ENCOUNTERING FRIENDS ON THIS APPROACHING SHIP WE WOULD FIND ONLY PITILESS ENEMIES
CONSEQUENTLY CAPTAIN NEMO TOOK EVERY DESIRED PRECAUTION IN CROSSING IT
FOR SEVERAL HOURS THE NAUTILUS DRIFTED IN THIS BRILLIANT TIDE AND OUR WONDERMENT GREW WHEN WE SAW HUGE MARINE ANIMALS CAVORTING IN IT LIKE THE FIRE-DWELLING SALAMANDERS OF MYTH
HOWEVER SEEING THAT IT STAYED MOTIONLESS THEY REGAINED CONFIDENCE LITTLE BY LITTLE AND TRIED TO BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH IT
HEARTS WERE POUNDING HIDEOUSLY GEARING UP FOR FUTURES FULL OF INCURABLE ANEURYSMS
DEPARTING FROM 500,000 THROATS THREE CHEERS BURST FORTH IN SUCCESSION
AFTER SOME MINUTES OF SILENCE
I HAD NO REASON TO BLAME MYSELF
THESE CLASSES ARE THE CRUSTACEA CIRRIPEDIA AND ANNELIDA
WILL ANYONE BELIEVE ME IF I ASSERT THAT AT THIS THIRTY-FOOT DEPTH I COULD SEE AS IF IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT
FURTHERMORE HE SEEMED TO BE RAISING CERTAIN OBJECTIONS THAT HIS CHIEF OFFICER KEPT ANSWERING WITH FLAT ASSURANCES
THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN REPLIED BY THREE TIMES LOWERING AND HOISTING THE AMERICAN FLAG WHOSE THIRTY-NINE STARS GLEAMED FROM THE GAFF OF THE MIZZEN SAIL
BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN A GOOD WHILE SINCE WE WERE COMPLETELY OVER OUR EXHAUSTION
LOOMING LIKE A LONG REEF THE NAUTILUS'S HULL DISAPPEARED LITTLE BY LITTLE BUT WHEN NIGHT FELL IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS THE SHIP'S BEACON WOULD SURELY FACILITATE OUR RETURN ON BOARD SINCE ITS RAYS CARRIED WITH PERFECT DISTINCTNESS
BUT TELL ME ISN'T THAT THE NOISE CETACEANS MAKE WHEN THEY SPURT WATER FROM THEIR BLOWHOLES THE VERY NOISE SIR BUT THIS ONE'S WAY LOUDER
IT MADE A FULL CIRCLE AROUND THE FRIGATE--THEN DOING FOURTEEN KNOTS--AND WRAPPED US IN SHEETS OF ELECTRICITY THAT WERE LIKE LUMINOUS DUST
DID HE SIMPLY LIMIT HIMSELF TO STORING THE AIR IN HIGH-PRESSURE TANKS AND THEN DISPENSE IT ACCORDING TO HIS CREW'S NEEDS
WE HAD TO WAIT FOR DAYLIGHT TO FIND SOME WAY OF GETTING INSIDE THIS UNDERWATER BOAT
AN UPPER CURRENT LONG KNOWN TO EXIST THAT CARRIES THE OCEAN'S WATERS INTO THE MEDITERRANEAN BASIN
CONSEIL IN SPITE OF HIMSELF SEEMED ALMOST FASCINATED I WAS STUNNED
TRUE TO THOSE INSTINCTS NED LAND GREEDILY STUFFED THE FINEST OF THESE MOLLUSKS INTO A NET HE CARRIED AT HIS SIDE
JUST THEN THE CHIEF OFFICER DREW THE CAPTAIN'S ATTENTION ANEW
THE SHIP'S BEACON LIT UP THAT WHOLE PLACID SURFACE WHICH EXPERIENCED NEITHER RIPPLES NOR UNDULATIONS
JUST THEN THE LUMINOUS GLOBE LIGHTING OUR CELL WENT OUT LEAVING US IN PROFOUND DARKNESS
THESE FLAT DISKS ON THEIR HEADS CONSIST OF CROSSWISE PLATES OF MOVABLE CARTILAGE BETWEEN WHICH THE ANIMALS CAN CREATE A VACUUM ENABLING THEM TO STICK TO OBJECTS LIKE SUCTION CUPS
A REQUEST TO THIS EFFECT WAS PRESENTED TO THE COMMANDER
FLYING DRAGONFISH WITH LONG SNOUTS AND HIGHLY DISTENDED PECTORAL FINS SHAPED LIKE WINGS WHICH ENABLE THEM IF NOT TO FLY AT LEAST TO SPRING INTO THE AIR
SHELLS FURROWED THE WATER AROUND US DRILLING THROUGH IT WITH AN ODD HISSING SOUND
WHO HAD SET UP THESE ROCKS AND STONES LIKE THE DOLMENS OF PREHISTORIC TIMES
WE HUGGED IT FROM LESS THAN TWO MILES OUT
THE SEAFLOOR KEPT SINKING AND ITS SIGNIFICANTLY STEEPER SLOPE TOOK US TO GREATER DEPTHS
DEEP DOWN THEY'RE JUST POOR DEVILS THESE PAPUANS AND I DON'T WANT MY VISIT TO GUEBOROA ISLAND TO COST THE LIFE OF A SINGLE ONE OF THESE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE ON THIS NOTE I WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW
NEVER HAD THE CREW OF AN AMERICAN NAVAL CRAFT SHOWN MORE PATIENCE AND ZEAL
CONSEIL LIKE ME HAD STOPPED BEFORE THIS SPLENDID SIGHT
SO CONSEIL ASKED YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED NED MY FRIEND HUMPH THE CANADIAN PUT IN
HOWEVER THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM SUBMITTED TO ME CAN TAKE THE FORM OF A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO ALTERNATIVES
WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER CAPTAIN NEMO HEADED TO THE DOOR OF HIS STATEROOM OPENED IT AND ENTERED
WE ALL THREE STOOD UP RIFLES TO OUR SHOULDERS READY TO ANSWER ANY ATTACK
IT WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL
SIR NED WENT ON LET'S SUPPOSE THAT BY SOME IMPOSSIBILITY CAPTAIN NEMO OFFERED YOUR FREEDOM TO YOU THIS VERY DAY
AND CONTRARY TO CUSTOM IT EXECUTED SUCH A MANEUVER SEVERAL TIMES DURING THAT DAY OF JANUARY 19
I HAD GOTTEN TO THIS POINT IN MY OBSERVATIONS WHEN NED AND CONSEIL WOKE UP ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS REVIVING AIR PURIFICATION
AND FROM WHAT COUNTRY ROGUEDOM MY GALLANT NED AS YET THAT COUNTRY ISN'T CLEARLY MARKED ON MAPS OF THE WORLD BUT I ADMIT THAT THE NATIONALITY OF THESE TWO STRANGERS IS HARD TO MAKE OUT
1.018 FOR THE WATERS OF THE IONIAN SEA AND 1.029 FOR THE WATERS OF THE ADRIATIC ASSUREDLY THE NAUTILUS DIDN'T AVOID THE HEAVILY TRAVELED SEAS OF EUROPE AND FROM THIS INSIGHT I CONCLUDED THAT THE SHIP WOULD TAKE US BACK--PERHAPS VERY SOON--TO MORE CIVILIZED SHORES
A MAN WOULD GO AN EVEN GREATER DISTANCE JUST TO STARE AT SUCH A SIGHT AH I EXCLAIMED
LIKE A CETACEAN'S TAIL ITS PROPELLER CHURNED THE WAVES SLOWLY
THE STUMPS OF THREE MASTS CHOPPED OFF TWO FEET ABOVE THE DECK INDICATED A FLOODING SHIP THAT HAD BEEN FORCED TO SACRIFICE ITS MASTING
CHAPTER 23 AEGRI SOMNIA LATIN
THE STOPCOCKS OF THE BALLAST TANKS WERE THEN OPENED WIDE AND 100 CUBIC METERS OF WATER RUSHED IN INCREASING THE NAUTILUS'S WEIGHT BY 100,000 KILOGRAMS
SO AFTER INQUIRIES CONDUCTED IN ENGLAND FRANCE RUSSIA PRUSSIA SPAIN ITALY AMERICA AND EVEN TURKEY THE HYPOTHESIS OF AN UNDERWATER MONITOR WAS ULTIMATELY REJECTED
I STILL COULDN'T SEE HOW THIS PIECE OF HISTORY CONCERNED ME
I WANTED TO SEE IF THE NAUTILUS'S HEADING WAS ACTUALLY TAKING US CLOSER TO THE COAST OR SPIRITING US FARTHER AWAY
NO SOLEMN PROMISES BOUND US TO HIM
NO DOUBT I WILL DO LIKEWISE
ONE CARRIED A HARPOON AND LINE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN WHALE FISHING
WHEN I ENCOUNTER HIM PROFESSOR ARONNAX WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO FIND HIM MYSELF NO LET ME DO IT
AT NOON THAT DAY AFTER OUR POSITION FIX CAPTAIN NEMO CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM WHERE I HAPPENED TO BE
SO NOW LET'S HAVE A CHAT ABOUT OUR LITTLE DOINGS IF YOU PLEASE BUT IN SUCH A WAY THAT NOBODY OVERHEARS I COULD EASILY SEE WHAT THE CANADIAN WAS DRIVING AT
WE'RE OLD CHUMS WHALES AND I AND I COULDN'T MISTAKE THEIR LITTLE WAYS LET'S WAIT AND SEE CONSEIL SAID
ALL DAY LONG ON MAY 31 THE NAUTILUS SWEPT AROUND THE SEA IN A SERIES OF CIRCLES THAT HAD ME DEEPLY PUZZLED
BESIDES I MUSED ALL ROADS LEAD HOME TO EUROPE AND OUR UNICORN MAY BE GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO TAKE ME TOWARD THE COAST OF FRANCE
AS FOR ME I STARED INDUSTRIOUSLY IN THE DIRECTION UNDER OBSERVATION BUT WITHOUT SPOTTING A THING
HE WHO CATCHES THEM DOESN'T EAT THEM FINALLY ADORNED WITH EMERALD RIBBONS AND DRESSED IN VELVET AND SILK GOLDEN ANGELFISH PASSED BEFORE OUR EYES LIKE COURTIERS IN THE PAINTINGS OF VERONESE
DECIMETER ROUGHLY 4 INCHES
BUT I CAN ALSO MOVE THE NAUTILUS UPWARD AND DOWNWARD ON A VERTICAL PLANE BY THE SIMPLE METHOD OF SLANTING ITS TWO FINS WHICH ARE ATTACHED TO ITS SIDES AT ITS CENTER OF FLOTATION
NO YET HERE IT IS
THE INJECTIONS COULDN'T GET IT TO GO A SINGLE DEGREE HIGHER
RETIRE BENEATH THIS OPEN SEA AND LET SIX MONTHS OF NIGHT SPREAD THEIR SHADOWS OVER MY NEW DOMAINS CHAPTER 15 ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT
NEAR TWO O'CLOCK I WAS BUSY ORGANIZING MY NOTES IN THE LOUNGE WHEN THE CAPTAIN OPENED THE DOOR AND APPEARED
AND NOW IF YOU'LL KINDLY GO BELOW PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE NAUTILUS IS ABOUT TO SINK BENEATH THE WAVES AND IT WILL ONLY RETURN TO THE SURFACE AFTER WE'VE CLEARED THE ARABIAN TUNNEL I FOLLOWED CAPTAIN NEMO
AND EVEN IF IT WAS A BOAT AS SECRETIVE AS OURS WOULDN'T RISK A CANAL INTERSECTED WITH LOCKS
SIR HE TOLD ME THAT DAY IT'S GOT TO STOP
THEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON THE PLATFORM
THAT'S WHY I'LL KEEP ON MY GUARD SIR THE WHOLE CREW STAYED ON THEIR FEET ALL NIGHT LONG
VERNE'S NOVEL FEATURES A TOUR OF THE MAJOR OCEANS AND THE TERM LEAGUES IN ITS TITLE IS USED AS A MEASURE NOT OF DEPTH BUT DISTANCE
IN LIGHTHEARTED COUNTRIES PEOPLE JOKED ABOUT THIS PHENOMENON BUT SUCH SERIOUS PRACTICAL COUNTRIES AS ENGLAND AMERICA AND GERMANY WERE DEEPLY CONCERNED
BY THEN CROWDED WITH JELLYFISH SQUID AND OTHER DEVILFISH THE OCEANS WILL HAVE BECOME HUGE CENTERS OF INFECTION BECAUSE THEIR WAVES WILL NO LONGER POSSESS THESE HUGE STOMACHS THAT GOD HAS ENTRUSTED WITH SCOURING THE SURFACE OF THE SEA MEANWHILE WITHOUT SCORNING THESE THEORIES THE NAUTILUS'S CREW CAPTURED HALF A DOZEN MANATEES
IN FACT THERE BENEATH MY EYES WAS A TOWN IN RUINS DEMOLISHED OVERWHELMED LAID LOW ITS ROOFS CAVED IN ITS TEMPLES PULLED DOWN ITS ARCHES DISLOCATED ITS COLUMNS STRETCHING OVER THE EARTH
AND ABOVE ALL DON'T LET THEM LEAD YOU TO FLARE UP AGAINST OUR HOSTS WHICH WOULD ONLY MAKE OUR SITUATION WORSE ANYHOW THE HARPOONER SAID I'M AS HUNGRY AS ALL HADES AND DINNER OR BREAKFAST NOT ONE PUNY MEAL HAS ARRIVED MR LAND I ANSWERED WE HAVE TO ADAPT TO THE SCHEDULE ON BOARD AND I IMAGINE OUR STOMACHS ARE RUNNING AHEAD OF THE CHIEF COOK'S DINNER BELL WELL THEN WE'LL ADJUST OUR STOMACHS TO THE CHEF'S TIMETABLE CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY
OUR LAMPS CAST A SORT OF BRILLIANT TWILIGHT OVER THE AREA MAKING INORDINATELY LONG SHADOWS ON THE SEAFLOOR
SO I CAN DESCEND TO CONSIDERABLE DEPTHS
WHEN MY EXPLANATION WAS OVER I INVITED HIM TO DIP HIS HANDS INTO ITS CURRENT
BUT SPOTTING THAT THEY SWAM TOO FAST OUR CREATOR TWISTED THEIR TAILS AND EVER SINCE THEY'VE BEEN THRASHING THE WAVES UP AND DOWN AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR SPEED FINE NED I SAID THEN RESURRECTED ONE OF THE CANADIAN'S EXPRESSIONS
HAD HUMAN BEINGS FANNED THOSE FLAMES
NOON ARRIVED WITHOUT THE ORB OF DAY APPEARING FOR A SINGLE INSTANT
THEY GROW ONLY FOR ME
THAT HE TOLD ME IS A GASEOUS DISCHARGE CAUSED BY OUR USE OF SODIUM BUT IT'S ONLY A MILD INCONVENIENCE
AN INCIDENT CAPTAIN NO SIR HE REPLIED THIS TIME AN ACCIDENT SERIOUS PERHAPS IS THERE ANY IMMEDIATE DANGER NO THE NAUTILUS HAS RUN AGROUND YES AND THIS ACCIDENT CAME ABOUT THROUGH NATURE'S UNPREDICTABILITY NOT MAN'S INCAPACITY
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME HE CAME OVER GRACIOUSLY OFFERED ME A CIGAR AND SAID TO ME
SINCE OUR WEAPONS MADE NO SOUND WHEN THEY WENT OFF THEY WOULD HAVE ONLY A MODERATE EFFECT ON THESE ISLANDERS WHO REPUTEDLY RESPECT NOTHING BUT NOISY MECHANISMS
HIS VOYAGES TO CIRCUMNAVIGATE THE GLOBE HIS DOUBLE ATTEMPT AT THE SOUTH POLE WHICH LED TO HIS DISCOVERY OF THE ADéLIE COAST AND THE LOUIS-PHILIPPE PENINSULA FINALLY HIS HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS OF THE CHIEF ISLANDS IN OCEANIA
THE POOR FELLOW WAS DONE FOR
THE DEVILFISH 266 19
PERHAPS HIS NERVES WERE TWITCHING WITH CURIOSITY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY
THEN OUR SHIP WENT ALONG AT A DISTANCE OF SIX MILES FROM THE ARABIC COASTS OF MAHRA AND HADHRAMAUT THEIR UNDULATING LINES OF MOUNTAINS RELIEVED BY A FEW ANCIENT RUINS
FOOTSTEPS RANG ON THE METAL TILING
IT KNOWS I CAN'T DO A BLESSED THING TO IT NED STAMPED HIS FOOT
WAS IT HERE THAT THIS STRANGE MAN CAME TO REVIVE HIMSELF BASKING IN HISTORICAL MEMORIES RELIVING THAT BYGONE LIFE HE WHO HAD NO DESIRE FOR OUR MODERN ONE
THE MEMORY OF THAT IMPRISONMENT UNDER THE ICE FADED FROM OUR MINDS
THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE OPENED AND MANEUVERS BEGAN FOR REACHING THOSE STRATA SO PRODIGIOUSLY FAR REMOVED
SOON THE PANELS CLOSED
OH THAT GULF STREAM
HERE AND THERE STOOD SHARP PEAKS LEAN SPIRES THAT ROSE AS HIGH AS 200 FEET
THE SEAFLOOR IN THIS FOREST WAS STREWN WITH SHARP CHUNKS OF STONE THAT WERE HARD TO AVOID
THE SKIFF STAYED ALONGSIDE IN THE SAME PLACE WE HAD LEFT IT
149 156 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS THE TORRES STRAIT 155 158 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS SOME DAYS ASHORE 158 SOME DAYS ASHORE 157 168 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS SOME DAYS ASHORE 167 170 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS THE LIGHTNING BOLTS OF CAPTAIN NEMO 170 THE LIGHTNING BOLTS OF CAPTAIN NEMO 169 180 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS THE LIGHTNING BOLTS OF CAPTAIN NEMO 179 182 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS 184 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS AEGRI SOMNIA 131 186 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS 190 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS AEGRI SOMNIA 189 192 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS THE CORAL REALM 193 194 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS 198 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS THE CORAL REALM 197 SECOND PART CHAPTER 1 THE INDIAN OCEAN NOW WE BEGIN THE SECOND
I BELIEVE THE AVERAGE TIME UNDERWATER THAT THESE FISHERMEN CAN TOLERATE IS THIRTY SECONDS DURING WHICH THEY HASTILY STUFF THEIR LITTLE NETS WITH ALL THE PEARL OYSTERS THEY CAN TEAR LOOSE
THE NATURALISTS OF ANTIQUITY MADE A SPECIAL STUDY OF THEM AND THESE ANIMALS FURNISHED MANY RIBALD FIGURES OF SPEECH FOR SOAPBOX ORATORS IN THE GREEK MARKETPLACE AS WELL AS EXCELLENT DISHES FOR THE TABLES OF RICH CITIZENS IF WE'RE TO BELIEVE ATHENAEUS A GREEK PHYSICIAN PREDATING GALEN
HOWEVER FROM LORD-KNOWS-WHAT WHIM ONE DAY IT DID A DIAGONAL DIVE BY MEANS OF ITS SLANTING FINS REACHING STRATA LOCATED 2,000 METERS UNDERWATER
WHEN I CONSULTED THE CHART AN HOUR LATER I SAW THAT THE NAUTILUS'S POSITION WAS MARKED AT LONGITUDE 16 DEGREES 17 AND LATITUDE 33 DEGREES 22 A GOOD 150 LEAGUES FROM THE NEAREST COAST
SEAHORSES COMMON TO EVERY OCEAN
BUT BEING IN MASTER'S EMPLOY I FOLLOWED MASTER THE FINE LAD THOUGHT THIS ONLY NATURAL
I CAME TO ASK MASTER THAT CONSEIL REPLIED
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NAUTILUS
IN DRAWING UP PLANS FOR A SHIP MEANT TO NAVIGATE UNDERWATER I WANTED IT WHEN FLOATING ON THE WAVES TO LIE NINE-TENTHS BELOW THE SURFACE AND TO EMERGE ONLY ONE-TENTH
MY HEART WAS POUNDING FIT TO BURST
THAT NIGHT MY SLEEP WAS FITFUL
ALL RIGHT AT NOON WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT OUR POSITION IS THE CANADIAN RETURNED TO CONSEIL'S SIDE
TO SAY HE RISKED HIS LIFE TWENTY TIMES IN ORDER TO CAPTURE THIS BIRD IS SIMPLY THE UNADULTERATED TRUTH
THE BAROMETER WHICH HAD BEEN FALLING FOR SOME DAYS FORECAST AN APPROACHING STRUGGLE OF THE ELEMENTS
MY PULSE WAS THROBBING VIOLENTLY
CHAPTER 13 THE ICE BANK THE NAUTILUS RESUMED ITS UNRUFFLED SOUTHBOUND HEADING
I HADN'T SEEN CAPTAIN NEMO FOR OVER A WEEK WHEN ON THE MORNING OF THE 27TH HE ENTERED THE MAIN LOUNGE AS USUAL ACTING AS IF HE'D BEEN GONE FOR JUST FIVE MINUTES
I GLIMPSED THE OCTAGONAL MINARETS OF THIS TOWN WHICH USED TO BE ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST BUSIEST COMMERCIAL CENTERS ALONG THIS COAST AS THE ARAB HISTORIAN IDRISI TELLS IT
SINCE YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THEM ME
ACCORDINGLY IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA ALONE 5,000 SHIPS MANNED BY 75,000 SEAMEN GO AFTER COD
AT THE MOMENT OF OUR NOON SIGHTS WE PASSED FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE ISLAND OF AUROU WHICH LOOKED TO ME LIKE A MASS OF GREEN WOODS CROWNED BY A PEAK OF GREAT HEIGHT
BUT NO DOUBT THE CETACEAN ITSELF HAD WARMED UP BECAUSE WITHOUT THE LEAST TROUBLE IT ALSO DID 19.3
SO WE COULD COUNT ONLY ON ITS LONGBOATS
CONSEIL KEPT NED UNDER OBSERVATION
GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN JONAHS TOOK REFUGE IN THE BELLIES OF WHALES
IT'S A HANDY PLANT THAT NATURE GIVES TO REGIONS LACKING IN WHEAT
IT'S REPULSIVE AND HORRIBLE
IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS A MAN APPEARED A DIVER CARRYING A LITTLE LEATHER BAG AT HIS BELT
MY SWOLLEN LIPS WOULDN'T LET A SINGLE SOUND THROUGH
MY CREW CLOSE UP THE HOLE BELONGING TO THE NAUTILUS
I'VE SET OUR COURSE EAST-NORTHEAST AT A DEPTH OF FIFTY METERS
THE WATERS WERE PROFOUNDLY DARK BUT CAPTAIN NEMO POINTED TO A REDDISH SPOT IN THE DISTANCE A SORT OF WIDE GLOW SHIMMERING ABOUT TWO MILES FROM THE NAUTILUS
WHAT'S WRONG NED MY FRIEND
WE WAITED WE LISTENED WE FORGOT OUR SUFFERINGS WE HOPED ONCE MORE
WE'RE GOING THROUGH CONSEIL MUTTERED IN MY EAR
IF CAPTAIN NEMO LET IT APPROACH A CHANCE FOR SALVATION MIGHT BE AVAILABLE TO US
THESE BANKS ARE THE RESULT OF MARINE SEDIMENTATION AN EXTENSIVE ACCUMULATION OF ORGANIC WASTE BROUGHT EITHER FROM THE EQUATOR BY THE GULF STREAM'S CURRENT OR FROM THE NORTH POLE BY THE COUNTERCURRENT OF COLD WATER THAT SKIRTS THE AMERICAN COAST
BUT ONE WORD TWENTY TIMES REPEATED ONE DREADFUL WORD TOLD ME THE REASON FOR THE AGITATION SPREADING ABOARD THE NAUTILUS
I BELIEVE IT
AND SO IT TURNED OUT
HE'S OBSESSED BY HIS OLD MEMORIES AND IT'S BREAKING HIS HEART
BECAUSE WE'VE BECOME OLD FRIENDS UNITED IN THAT PERMANENT COMRADESHIP BORN AND CEMENTED DURING ONLY THE MOST FRIGHTFUL CRISES
MAYBE THEY'LL REALIZE WE'RE DECENT PEOPLE NED LAND PULLED OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO WAVE IT IN THE AIR
WHAT DID YOU SEE I SAW HE MUTTERED I SAW BUT WE MUSTN'T TALK SAVE OUR STRENGTH WHAT HAD HE SEEN
LOOK CAPTAIN
BUT THE NAUTILUS WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH THESE NASTY ANIMALS
NO DOUBT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SOUTH POLE THE CANADIAN HATED HAVING TO EAT HIS WORDS
NO I REPLIED ANOTHER BISHOP PONTOPPIDAN OF BERGEN ALSO TELLS OF A DEVILFISH SO LARGE A WHOLE CAVALRY REGIMENT COULD MANEUVER ON IT THEY SURE DID GO ON THOSE OLDTIME BISHOPS NED LAND SAID
IN ESSENCE ON JULY 20 1866 THE STEAMER GOVERNOR HIGGINSON FROM THE CALCUTTA BURNACH STEAM NAVIGATION CO ENCOUNTERED THIS MOVING MASS FIVE MILES OFF THE EASTERN SHORES OF AUSTRALIA
TINY ANIMALS--WORMS INSECTS--RODE ASHORE ON TREE TRUNKS SNATCHED FROM ISLANDS TO WINDWARD
MY COMPANIONS WERE AS STARTLED AS I WAS
AN OCEAN WHOSE PARALLEL WINDING SHORES FORM AN IMMENSE PERIMETER FED BY THE WORLD'S GREATEST RIVERS
THE HATCHES WERE OPEN
THE YELLOW SPONGE FROM SYRIA THE HORN SPONGE FROM BARBARY ETC
NEXT THEY'RE IMMERSED IN HUGE TANKS OF SALT WATER THEN THEY'RE OPENED UP AND WASHED
I HAD LOST ALL SENSE OF TIME
IT THEN OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF NED HAD CHOSEN THESE WATERWAYS FOR OUR ESCAPE ATTEMPT WE WOULDN'T HAVE COME OUT ALIVE FROM THIS SEA OF FIRE
OUR PROPELLER IS JAMMED
IT'S ONE MORE DANGER BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY WAY OF WARDING IT OFF
FIRE HAD POLISHED THE SPARKLING ENAMEL OF ITS INNER WALLS SPRINKLED ALL OVER WITH MICA-RICH DUST
NEVERTHELESS I'M WELL AWARE THAT THE NAUTILUS IS DRAWING NEAR TO POPULATED SHORES AND IF SOME CHANCE FOR SALVATION BECOMES AVAILABLE TO US IT WOULD BE SHEER CRUELTY TO SACRIFICE MY COMPANIONS TO MY PASSION FOR THE UNKNOWN
IN A FEW MINUTES THE WATER REACHED 100 DEGREES CENTIGRADE
AMONG THE WORKS OF MODERN ART WERE PICTURES SIGNED BY DELACROIX INGRES DECAMPS TROYON MEISSONIER DAUBIGNY ETC AND SOME WONDERFUL MINIATURE STATUES IN MARBLE OR BRONZE MODELED AFTER ANTIQUITY'S FINEST ORIGINALS STOOD ON THEIR PEDESTALS IN THE CORNERS OF THIS MAGNIFICENT MUSEUM
HAD I BEEN MISTAKEN
HE WAS A FANATIC ON FORMALITY AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON--TO THE POINT WHERE IT GOT TIRESOME
ON FEBRUARY 18 NEAR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IT HOVE BEFORE THE ENTRANCE TO THE STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR
NOT EVEN ANGEL-WING CLAMS OR SALPS HAVE EVER GIVEN OFF SUCH A POWERFUL LIGHT
I ALSO NOTICED SOME WRASSE KNOWN AS THE TAPIRO THREE DECIMETERS LONG BONY FISH WITH TRANSPARENT SCALES WHOSE BLUISH GRAY COLOR IS MIXED WITH RED SPOTS
IT WAS A DELIGHTFUL ANIMAL WHOSE DISCOVERY ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENTS IS A SIGN OF GOOD LUCK
HE HAD RECEIVED ME COOLLY BUT HOSPITABLY
AN IMMENSE WAKE OF GLOWING WHITENESS MARKED THE ANIMAL'S TRACK SWEEPING IN A LONG CURVE
FOR TWO HOURS A WHOLE AQUATIC ARMY ESCORTED THE NAUTILUS
AFTER NED WAS DRESSED I REENTERED THE LOUNGE WHOSE WINDOWS HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
FISH DIDN'T LINGER IN THESE IMPRISONED WATERS
HIS COAL BUNKERS WERE OVERFLOWING
YET IT HAD BEEN ONLY TWO MONTHS SINCE WE HAD BECOME AS CAPTAIN NEMO EXPRESSED IT PASSENGERS ON THE NAUTILUS IN OTHER WORDS THE LITERAL PRISONERS OF ITS COMMANDER
AND I CAN IMAGINE THE FOUNDING OF NAUTICAL TOWNS CLUSTERS OF UNDERWATER HOUSEHOLDS THAT LIKE THE NAUTILUS WOULD RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA TO BREATHE EACH MORNING FREE TOWNS IF EVER THERE WERE INDEPENDENT CITIES
SO OUR SALVATION LAY TOTALLY IN THE HANDS OF THE MYSTERIOUS HELMSMEN STEERING THIS SUBMERSIBLE AND IF IT MADE A DIVE WE WERE DONE FOR
HETZEL ET CIE
WE STARED AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT I WAS ABOUT TO WITNESS A STRANGE SCENE
HOW HAD THE CAPTAIN AMASSED THIS GOLD AND WHAT WAS HE ABOUT TO DO WITH IT
BUT WHEN I AWOKE IT SEEMED AS IF THE SUN WERE SETTLING TOWARD THE HORIZON
THE LOCKS WERE TURNED THE DOOR OPENED THE STEWARD APPEARED
THIS NEWS CAUSED INTENSE EXCITEMENT
JUST THEN THE MOON APPEARED FOR AN INSTANT THROUGH THE WATERY MASS CASTING A FEW PALE RAYS OVER THIS SUBMERGED CONTINENT
A BOLD DIVER
YOU WON'T PULL IT OFF BECAUSE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN CERTAIN NAVIGATORS HAVE CRUISED THROUGH MILK SEAS FOR MORE THAN FORTY MILES I'M NOT SURE THAT CONSEIL HEEDED MY RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE HE SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN THOUGHT NO DOUBT TRYING TO CALCULATE HOW MANY ONE-FIFTHS OF A MILLIMETER ARE FOUND IN FORTY SQUARE MILES
THE FRIGATE SKIRTED THE FLAT YELLOW COAST OF LONG ISLAND
HE NEVER EXTENDED HIS OWN
IF A CONTINENT EMERGES AT THE POLE WE'LL STOP AT THAT CONTINENT
MY COMPANIONS WEREN'T YET STIRRING AND STILL LAY IN THEIR CORNERS LIKE INANIMATE OBJECTS
DAZZLING TRACTS OF WHITE
THE WAVES WERE DYED RED OVER AN AREA OF SEVERAL MILES AND THE NAUTILUS WAS FLOATING IN THE MIDDLE OF A SEA OF BLOOD
I'M FURIOUS THAT I HAVE TO ADMIT IT
ADMITTED THE CANADIAN REPLIED BUT WE'VE GOT TO RISK IT
BY JULY 23 THE GREAT EASTERN WAS LYING NO FARTHER THAN 800 KILOMETERS FROM NEWFOUNDLAND WHEN IT RECEIVED TELEGRAPHED NEWS FROM IRELAND OF AN ARMISTICE SIGNED BETWEEN PRUSSIA AND AUSTRIA AFTER THE BATTLE OF SADOVA
EELS BELONGING TO THE GENUS APTERONOTUS WHOSE SNOW-WHITE SNOUT IS VERY BLUNT THE BODY PAINTED A HANDSOME BLACK AND ARMED WITH A VERY LONG SLENDER FLESHY WHIP
ON THE FORECASTLE WAS MOUNTED THE LATEST MODEL BREECH-LOADING CANNON VERY HEAVY OF BARREL AND NARROW OF BORE A WEAPON THAT WOULD FIGURE IN THE UNIVERSAL EXHIBITION OF 1867
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER THEY'VE DISCOVERED THE NARWHALE AND THEY'RE CANNONADING THE SAME BUT IT MUST BE CLEAR TO THEM I EXCLAIMED THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH HUMAN BEINGS MAYBE THAT'S WHY NED LAND REPLIED STARING HARD AT ME
IN ESSENCE IT WAS A CLUSTER OF COUNTLESS OPEN-SEA INFUSORIA OF NOCTILUCA AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH WIDE ACTUAL GLOBULES OF TRANSPARENT JELLY EQUIPPED WITH A THREADLIKE TENTACLE UP TO 25,000 OF WHICH HAVE BEEN COUNTED IN THIRTY CUBIC CENTIMETERS OF WATER
I VENTURED ONTO THE PLATFORM
THE FORMER WERE OBVIOUSLY MEANT TO FEED THE LATTER
THE PERSIAN GULF HAS NO OUTLET AND IF WE ENTER THOSE WATERS IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE WE RETURN IN OUR TRACKS ALL RIGHT WE'LL RETURN MR LAND AND AFTER THE PERSIAN GULF IF THE NAUTILUS WANTS TO VISIT THE RED SEA THE STRAIT OF BAB EL MANDEB IS STILL THERE TO LET US IN I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU SIR NED LAND REPLIED THAT THE RED SEA IS JUST AS LANDLOCKED AS THE GULF SINCE THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ HASN'T BEEN CUT ALL THE WAY THROUGH YET
MADE IN AMERICA THIS VALUABLE INSTRUMENT COULD FIRE A FOUR-KILOGRAM CONICAL PROJECTILE AN AVERAGE DISTANCE OF SIXTEEN KILOMETERS WITHOUT THE LEAST BOTHER
WE WERE OVERLOADED WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE SKIFF
WAS THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN TACKING ABOUT
BUT WHAT HOUR IS IT THEN THE CANADIAN ASKED
SOMETIMES THEY WERE CUT ACROSS BY DEEP PITS THAT HAD TO BE CLEARED
I WAS SPEECHLESS WITH HORROR UNABLE TO MAKE A SINGLE MOVEMENT
THEY MAKE OCEAN WATER LESS OPEN TO EVAPORATION AND PREVENT WINDS FROM CARRYING OFF EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF STEAM WHICH WHEN CONDENSING WOULD SUBMERGE THE TEMPERATE ZONES
IT ANNOUNCES THE PRESENCE OF A PACK OR SHOAL OF ICE
SIMILARLY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN FISHERIES USED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL PROFIT OF 4,000,000 FRANCS DURING THE REIGN OF KING CHARLES V BUT NOW THEY BRING IN ONLY TWO-THIRDS OF THAT AMOUNT
A JOLT TOLD ME THAT THE NAUTILUS HAD BUMPED THE UNDERBELLY OF THE ICE BANK STILL QUITE THICK TO JUDGE FROM THE HOLLOWNESS OF THE ACCOMPANYING NOISE
BUT HOW ELSE COULD WE GO ABOUT IT
THIS WAS THE SETTING OF THAT BATTLE ON OCTOBER 22 1702
HENCE YOU OBSERVE THAT SODIUM CHLORIDE IS ENCOUNTERED THERE IN SIGNIFICANT PROPORTIONS
WOULD THE NAUTILUS DARE TO TACKLE THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
WE WERE TO ASK CAPTAIN NEMO THIS QUESTION STRAIGHT OUT
BUT I HAD GUESSED
BUT HE HAD BARELY UNFOLDED IT WHEN HE WAS FELLED BY AN IRON FIST AND DESPITE HIS GREAT STRENGTH HE TUMBLED TO THE DECK
I WENT BELOW JUST AS ANOTHER PROJECTILE SCRAPED THE NAUTILUS'S HULL AND I HEARD THE CAPTAIN EXCLAIM
BEFORE I COULD MAKE A SINGLE MOVEMENT TO PREVENT HIM THE CANADIAN RUSHED AT THE POOR MAN THREW HIM DOWN HELD HIM BY THE THROAT
I'VE CHASED PLENTY OF CETACEANS I'VE HARPOONED A GOOD NUMBER I'VE KILLED SEVERAL
AT 8:25 A SECOND COLLISION TOOK PLACE
IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING I THOUGHT THAT CAPTAIN NEMO MUST HAVE KEPT UP SOME TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SHORE
CONSEIL MORE CAUTIOUS OR MORE STABLE BARELY FALTERED AND WOULD HELP ME UP SAYING
BUT IF I EXHAUST ALL MY WONDERMENT ON THEM I'LL HAVE NOTHING LEFT FOR THE SHIP THAT CARRIES THEM
AFTER A FAIRLY LONG SILENCE THE COMMANDER WENT ON WITH OUR CONVERSATION
BUT WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S BEHIND THIS ICE BANK WHAT I ASKED
CAN IT RESTORE HEAT TO A CORPSE NOT THAT I'VE HEARD WELL MY FRIEND SOMEDAY THE EARTH WILL BE JUST SUCH A COLD CORPSE
IN ESSENCE THE YEAR BEFORE THE ROYAL HOUSES OF HOLLAND AUSTRIA AND ENGLAND HAD SIGNED A TREATY OF ALLIANCE AT THE HAGUE AIMING TO WREST THE SPANISH CROWN FROM KING PHILIP V AND TO PLACE IT ON THE HEAD OF AN ARCHDUKE WHOM THEY PREMATURELY DUBBED KING CHARLES III
IT TOOK MANY CENTURIES TO DISCOVER THE MECHANICAL POWER OF STEAM
HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE CANADIAN'S LATEST EXPLOITS WE WERE BACK ON THE INNER BEACH
DOESN'T IT HAVE THE ACTUAL GIFT OF LIFE
THIS WAS DUE TO THE LACK OF LANDMARKS
IN FACT I SAID MR LAND IS RIGHT
BUT SINCE FATE HAS LINKED OUR TWO LIVES I CAN REVEAL THE RESULTS OF MY OBSERVATIONS TO YOU I'M ALL ATTENTION CAPTAIN YOU'RE AWARE PROFESSOR THAT SALT WATER IS DENSER THAN FRESH WATER BUT THIS DENSITY ISN'T UNIFORM
COMMON EELS AND ELECTRIC EELS SO-SO JUST SO-SO NED LAND REPLIED
ITS AVERAGE DEPTH IS 3,000 FEET ITS AVERAGE WIDTH SIXTY MILES
HAD THEY SPOTTED OUR ESCAPE
HERE'S YOUR LAST CHANCE TO POCKET THAT $2,000.00 IF MASTER WILL PERMIT MY SAYING SO CONSEIL REPLIED I NEVER EXPECTED TO WIN THAT PRIZE AND THE UNION GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE PROMISED $100,000.00 AND BEEN NONE THE POORER YOU'RE RIGHT CONSEIL IT TURNED OUT TO BE A FOOLISH BUSINESS AFTER ALL AND WE JUMPED INTO IT TOO HASTILY
SIX ROWERS SAT ON THE THWARTS AND THE COXSWAIN TOOK THE TILLER
WE HAD STAKED OUR SALVATION ON THIS ONE LAST GAMBLE
IN THE REALM OF GEOLOGY HE STUDIES VOLCANOES LITERALLY INSIDE AND OUT
THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE INSTRUMENTS FOR TAKING THEIR BEARINGS THEY WENT BY GUESSWORK IN THE MIDST OF CURRENTS THEY BARELY KNEW
NOW THEN JUSTLY OR UNJUSTLY IT WAS THE MONSTER WHO STOOD ACCUSED OF THEIR DISAPPEARANCE
I DIDN'T THINK SO BECAUSE EVERY PREVIOUS ATTEMPT TO REACH THIS SPOT ON THE GLOBE HAD FAILED
IT'S EVEN SAID THAT IN 1814 WHEN THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT WENT FISHING ON ITS OWN BEHALF ITS DIVERS WORKED JUST TWENTY DAYS AND BROUGHT UP 76,000,000 OYSTERS AT LEAST I ASKED THE FISHERMEN ARE WELL PAID AREN'T THEY HARDLY PROFESSOR
LOOK AT THE NEEDLE ON THE PRESSURE GAUGE
WHO COULD EVER GET TIRED OF SUCH EXCITING HUNTING YOU'VE NEVER FISHED THESE SEAS NED NEVER SIR
THESE SPECIMENS WILL SOON HAVE TO DEAL WITH MIGHTY OPPONENTS
COME WITH ME
SO UNTIL INFORMATION BECOMES MORE ABUNDANT I PLUMP FOR A SEA UNICORN OF COLOSSAL DIMENSIONS NO LONGER ARMED WITH A MERE LANCE BUT WITH AN ACTUAL SPUR LIKE IRONCLAD FRIGATES OR THOSE WARSHIPS CALLED RAMS WHOSE MASS AND MOTOR POWER IT WOULD POSSESS SIMULTANEOUSLY
IN OTHER WORDS THEY'VE THIRTY TIMES THE THICKNESS FAIR ENOUGH CAPTAIN BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO SEE WE NEED LIGHT TO DRIVE AWAY THE DARK AND IN THE MIDST OF THE MURKY WATERS I WONDER HOW YOUR HELMSMAN CAN SET ASTERN OF THE PILOTHOUSE IS A POWERFUL ELECTRIC REFLECTOR WHOSE RAYS LIGHT UP THE SEA FOR A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OH BRAVO
THE NAUTILUS SUBMERGED WITHOUT DELAY
SURE ENOUGH I FOUND A VOLUME ENTITLED CEYLON AND THE SINGHALESE BY H
MY FRIEND THERE'D BE MANY MORE WITHOUT THEIR ENEMIES SCORPIONFISH AND HUMAN BEINGS
SO THIS WAY OF LIVING BEGAN TO SEEM SIMPLE AND NATURAL TO US AND WE NO LONGER ENVISIONED A DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET EARTH WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED TO REMIND US OF OUR STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES
IT TOOK ME A GOOD WHILE TO DECIDE THE COMMANDER WENT ON
FORE AND AFT STOOD TWO CUPOLAS OF MODERATE HEIGHT THEIR SIDES SLANTING AND PARTLY INSET WITH HEAVY BICONVEX GLASS ONE RESERVED FOR THE HELMSMAN STEERING THE NAUTILUS THE OTHER FOR THE BRILLIANCE OF THE POWERFUL ELECTRIC BEACON LIGHTING HIS WAY
WHAT FINE OXYGEN
IN SHORT HE WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE CANADIAN WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT CLASSIFICATION BUT COULD INSTANTLY PUT A NAME TO ANY FISH
HAD HE SEEN THAT VESSEL CHANGE COURSE AND SEEMINGLY HEAD TOWARD US
YE GODS SIR NED LAND TOLD ME
THERE I FOUND A SORT OF SHAFT HEADING UPWARD BETWEEN TWO WATERTIGHT BULKHEADS
WHAT'S MORE IN THIS CONSTANT TEMPERATURE WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CATCHING COLDS
THERE THE NAUTILUS GENERALLY DRIFTED AT A DEPTH BETWEEN 100 AND 200 METERS
THE BODY'S EXTREMITIES WERE ALREADY GROWING COLD AND I SAW THAT DEATH WAS APPROACHING WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF MY HOLDING IT IN CHECK
THE BLACK CURRENT 68 15
AN INSTANT LATER OUR FEET WERE TREADING THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
THE LOWER END OF EACH LINE DRAGGED THE BOTTOM BY MEANS OF A SMALL GRAPPLING IRON AND AT THE SURFACE IT WAS SECURED TO THE BUOY-ROPE OF A CORK FLOAT
I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
WHERE WAS HE TAKING US
AT NOON TOMORROW MARCH 21 IF AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR REFRACTION THE SUN'S DISK IS CUT EXACTLY IN HALF BY THE NORTHERN HORIZON THAT WILL MEAN I'M AT THE SOUTH POLE RIGHT I SAID
THE TANTRUMS OF NED LAND 41 10
THEY'RE EATEN IN PRODIGIOUS QUANTITIES AND WITHOUT THE ASTONISHING FERTILITY OF THESE FISH THE SEAS WOULD SOON BE DEPOPULATED OF THEM
THAT LOCALITY LIES A LITTLE ABOVE SUEZ IN A SOUND THAT USED TO FORM A DEEP ESTUARY WHEN THE RED SEA STRETCHED AS FAR AS THE BITTER LAKES
I WAS ALREADY WONDERING IF CAPTAIN NEMO RASH TO THE POINT OF SHEER INSANITY WANTED HIS SHIP TO TACKLE THE NARROWS WHERE DUMONT D'URVILLE'S TWO SLOOPS OF WAR HAD GONE AGROUND WHEN HE CHANGED DIRECTION A SECOND TIME AND CUT STRAIGHT TO THE WEST HEADING TOWARD GUEBOROA ISLAND
IT WAS MORE THAN TWENTY-FIVE FEET LONG
THE MUSSELS OF CERTAIN STREAMS IN SCOTLAND WALES IRELAND SAXONY BOHEMIA AND FRANCE GOOD THE CANADIAN REPLIED
THERE WE WERE SEPARATED FROM THE SEA BY A TEN-METER BARRIER
IT INDICATES THAT THE NAUTILUS IS RISING BUT THIS BLOCK OF ICE IS RISING WITH US AND UNTIL SOME OBSTACLE HALTS ITS UPWARD MOVEMENT OUR POSITION WON'T CHANGE INDEED THE NAUTILUS KEPT THE SAME HEEL TO STARBOARD
OBJECTS HANGING IN THE LOUNGE WERE VISIBLY RETURNING TO THEIR NORMAL POSITIONS
BESIDES I DON'T IMAGINE CAPTAIN NEMO WILL LET US GO HUNTING ON THE COASTS OF MALABAR OR COROMANDEL AS HE DID IN THE FORESTS OF NEW GUINEA WELL SIR CAN'T WE MANAGE WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION I DIDN'T ANSWER THE CANADIAN
HE WAS CIRCLING IT LIKE A WILD BEAST DRAWING IT EASTWARD LETTING IT CHASE AFTER HIM
IT'S A KIND OF NICOTINE-RICH SEAWEED THAT THE OCEAN SUPPLIES ME ALBEIT SPARINGLY
NOW THEN THIS LIQUID MASS NEARLY EQUALS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WATER THAT HAS POURED THROUGH ALL THE EARTH'S RIVERS FOR THE PAST 40,000 YEARS
PROFOUND SOLITUDE REIGNED OVER THIS GATHERING PLACE OF PEARL FISHERMEN
DANIEL O'CONNELL IRELAND'S DEFENDER
BUT I'LL MAKE ONE COMMENT WHAT'S THAT IF ALL THEIR EGGS HATCHED JUST FOUR CODFISH COULD FEED ENGLAND AMERICA AND NORWAY AS WE SKIMMED THE DEPTHS OF THE GRAND BANKS I COULD SEE PERFECTLY THOSE LONG FISHING LINES EACH ARMED WITH 200 HOOKS THAT EVERY BOAT DANGLED BY THE DOZENS
THE MAGIC OF THESE SOLAR COLORS DISAPPEARED LITTLE BY LITTLE WITH EMERALD AND SAPPHIRE SHADES VANISHING FROM OUR SURROUNDINGS ALTOGETHER
IF SHE DRAWS A BOUNDARY LINE THERE YOU STOP LIKE IT OR NOT CORRECT NED LAND BUT I STILL WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S BEHIND THIS ICE BANK
BUT WHEN THEY EXAMINED ITS UNDERSIDES IN THE SERVICE YARD THEY DISCOVERED THAT PART OF ITS KEEL HAD BEEN SMASHED
ONE DAY SOLON WAS CONVERSING WITH SOME ELDERLY WISE MEN IN THE EGYPTIAN CAPITAL OF SAIS A TOWN ALREADY 8,000 YEARS OF AGE AS DOCUMENTED BY THE ANNALS ENGRAVED ON THE SACRED WALLS OF ITS TEMPLES
COCONUTS ARE ADMIRABLE THINGS BUT BEFORE WE STUFF THE SKIFF WITH THEM IT WOULD BE WISE TO FIND OUT WHETHER THIS ISLAND OFFERS OTHER SUBSTANCES JUST AS USEFUL
TIME WOULD SOON TELL
ICE FLOES WERE INCREASING OVER THE OPEN WATER
THIS BIRD BELONGED TO THE FINEST OF THE EIGHT SPECIES CREDITED TO PAPUA AND ITS NEIGHBORING ISLANDS
BESIDES IT WAS THE LAST DAY THE NAUTILUS WOULD SPEND IN THESE WATERWAYS IF TOMORROW IT STILL FLOATED OFF TO THE OPEN SEA AS CAPTAIN NEMO HAD PROMISED
AN IMPERIAL SPINY OYSTER BRIGHTLY COLORED BRISTLING WITH THORNS A SPECIMEN RARE TO EUROPEAN MUSEUMS WHOSE VALUE I ESTIMATED AT 20,000 FRANCS
BUT CAPTAIN NEMO GAVE NO ORDERS
WAS IT A PRAYER FOR THE DEAD MURMURED IN THAT LANGUAGE I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
I WANTED TO VERIFY THE NAUTILUS'S HEADING
HE DIDN'T REPLY
BEFORE THE NAUTILUS'S SPUR THERE LAY VAST BROKEN PLAINS A TANGLE OF CONFUSED CHUNKS WITH ALL THE HELTER-SKELTER UNPREDICTABILITY TYPICAL OF A RIVER'S SURFACE A SHORT WHILE BEFORE ITS ICE BREAKUP
PERHAPS THE CANADIAN TRANSFERRED ME THERE
THE CLOCK MARKED THE HOUR OF FIVE
THE RESULTS SO OBTAINED CAN'T BE ADEQUATELY DOUBLE-CHECKED
HE'S IN MASTER'S EMPLOY HE THINKS LIKE MASTER HE SPEAKS LIKE MASTER AND MUCH TO HIS REGRET HE CAN'T BE COUNTED ON TO FORM A MAJORITY
AT THESE WORDS NED LAND STOOD UP QUICKLY
THEREFORE WE MUST LOOK FOR THE MULTIPLE OF 2,400 LITERS OF AIR THAT GIVES US THE AMOUNT FOUND IN THE NAUTILUS PRECISELY CONSEIL SAID
WHEN AN ICEBERG IS ERODED AT THE BASE BY WARMER WATERS OR BY REPEATED COLLISIONS ITS CENTER OF GRAVITY RISES
MY TWO COMPANIONS SAFE AND SOUND WERE AT MY BEDSIDE CLASPING MY HANDS
ITS WAVES AND BREEZES BROUGHT BACK TOO MANY MEMORIES IF NOT TOO MANY REGRETS
AFTER LEAVING THESE DELIGHTFUL ISLANDS TO THE PROTECTION OF THE FRENCH FLAG THE NAUTILUS COVERED ABOUT 2,000 MILES FROM DECEMBER 4 TO THE 11TH
MEANWHILE OUR SILENT STEWARD PERHAPS A DEAF-MUTE SET THE TABLE AND LAID THREE PLACE SETTINGS
WILL THE WAVES SOMEDAY DELIVER THAT MANUSCRIPT THAT CONTAINS HIS FULL LIFE STORY
REMORSE OR REGRET
BY THEN IT LAY 300 MILES FROM CAPE CLEAR AND AFTER THREE DAYS OF DELAY THAT FILLED LIVERPOOL WITH ACUTE ANXIETY IT ENTERED THE COMPANY DOCKS
YES PROFESSOR AND YOU'RE OFFERING TO TAKE ME TO THEM PRECISELY ON FOOT WITHOUT GETTING YOUR FEET WET WHILE HUNTING WHILE HUNTING RIFLES IN HAND RIFLES IN HAND I STARED AT THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER WITH AN AIR ANYTHING BUT FLATTERING TO THE MAN
CHAPTER 5 AT RANDOM
MOST WERE LOVELY SEA ANEMONE BELONGING TO THE FAMILY ACTINIDIA INCLUDING AMONG OTHER SPECIES THE PHYCTALIS PROTEXTA NATIVE TO THIS PART OF THE OCEAN
COME ON
THE NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT MISHAP
THE NAUTILUS'S PUMPS HAVE PRODIGIOUS STRENGTH AS YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED WHEN THEIR WATERSPOUTS SWEPT LIKE A TORRENT OVER THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
ANOTHER WEED KNOWN BY THE NAME VELP AND BOASTING FOUR-FOOT LEAVES WAS CRAMMED INTO THE CORAL CONCRETIONS AND CARPETED THE OCEAN FLOOR
I WROTE IT ON PAPER MANUFACTURED FROM MARINE EELGRASS
THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SHORE SEEMED TO BEAR OUT COMMANDER MAURY'S HYPOTHESES
SEVERAL VARIETIES OF WATERING-POT SHELL FROM JAVA A SORT OF LIMESTONE TUBE FRINGED WITH LEAFY FOLDS AND MUCH FOUGHT OVER BY COLLECTORS
I LEANED MY HAND AGAINST ONE OF THE WINDOWS BUT THE HEAT WAS SO GREAT I HAD TO SNATCH IT BACK
REVERSE ENGINES SAILORS RUSHED TO THE HELM ENGINEERS TO THEIR MACHINERY
THE CONTINENT WHOSE VERY EXISTENCE HAS BEEN DENIED BY SUCH PHILOSOPHERS AND SCIENTISTS AS ORIGEN PORPHYRY IAMBLICHUS D'ANVILLE MALTE-BRUN AND HUMBOLDT WHO ENTERED ITS DISAPPEARANCE IN THE LEDGER OF MYTHS AND FOLK TALES
THEY BELONGED TO THAT SPECIES OF ARGONAUT COVERED WITH PROTUBERANCES AND EXCLUSIVE TO THE SEAS NEAR INDIA
THE CONSTELLATIONS WERE GLITTERING WITH STARTLING INTENSITY
THE LEVEL SEAFLOOR ROSE IMPERCEPTIBLY
THE GRADIENTS GOT STEEPER AND NARROWER
BUT NO SUCH LUCK
HOWEVER THE SITUATION HAD CHANGED IN ONLY A SHORT TIME AND WE HADN'T NOTICED
AMONG THESE VALUABLE WATER PLANTS I NOTED VARIOUS SEAWEED
WHITE UNDERNEATH GRAY ABOVE WITH SPOTS OF GOLD SPARKLING IN THE DARK EDDIES OF THE WAVES
THE GRAVE WAS THEN COVERED OVER WITH THE RUBBLE DUG FROM THE SEAFLOOR AND IT FORMED A LOW MOUND
THE TORRES STRAIT IS ABOUT THIRTY-FOUR LEAGUES WIDE BUT IT'S OBSTRUCTED BY AN INCALCULABLE NUMBER OF ISLANDS ISLETS BREAKERS AND ROCKS THAT MAKE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO NAVIGATE
WE REACHED A DEPTH OF 16,000 METERS FOUR VERTICAL LEAGUES--AND BY THEN THE NAUTILUS'S PLATING WAS TOLERATING A PRESSURE OF 1,600 ATMOSPHERES IN OTHER WORDS 1,600 KILOGRAMS PER EACH SQUARE CENTIMETER ON ITS SURFACE
AS THE ANCIENTS TELL IT WHEN THESE LITTLE FISH CLING TO THE UNDERSIDES OF A SHIP THEY CAN BRING IT TO A HALT AND BY SO IMPEDING MARK ANTONY'S VESSEL DURING THE BATTLE OF ACTIUM ONE OF THEM FACILITATED THE VICTORY OF AUGUSTUS CAESAR
THE HUMAN BEING ROBBED OF HIS FREE WILL CRAVES SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY
JUST THEN I WAS STUDYING A DELIGHTFUL BOOK BY JEAN MACé THE SERVANTS OF THE STOMACH AND SAVORING ITS INGENIOUS TEACHINGS WHEN CONSEIL INTERRUPTED MY READING
SUDDENLY A NOISE FROM THE SHIP'S INTERIOR BECAME AUDIBLE
BY THEN THE IRONCLAD WAS NO MORE THAN THREE MILES OFF
THE SEA GREW TOWERING INFLATED BY LONG SWELLS
I WAS ABOUT TO GO BELOW TO ALERT THEM WHEN THE CHIEF OFFICER CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
IT WAS HIDDEN FROM OUR EYES BY CLOUDS SQUEEZED TOGETHER ON THE HORIZON
HETZEL ET CIE THE HARDCOVER FIRST EDITION ISSUED IN THE AUTUMN OF 1871 COLLATED WITH THE SOFTCOVER EDITIONS OF THE FIRST AND SECOND PARTS ISSUED SEPARATELY IN THE AUTUMN OF 1869 AND THE SUMMER OF 1870
MORE STUNNED THAN AFRAID WE STOOD MUTE AND MOTIONLESS
IN IT YOU CAN VIEW THESE PRIMORDIAL ROCKS THAT HAVE NEVER SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY THIS NETHER GRANITE THAT FORMS THE POWERFUL FOUNDATION OF OUR GLOBE THE DEEP CAVES CUT INTO THE STONY MASS THE OUTLINES OF INCOMPARABLE DISTINCTNESS WHOSE FAR EDGES STAND OUT IN BLACK AS IF FROM THE BRUSH OF CERTAIN FLEMISH PAINTERS
I SOON HEARD THE POOR LAD GASPING
THEN THE VISIONS DISAPPEARED AND LEFT ME IN UTTER OBLIVION
THEY FRACTURE IN THEIR FALL AND ARE OPENED BY ITS POWERFUL PINCERS
I DIDN'T TELL MY TWO COMPANIONS ABOUT THIS NEW DANGER
AS FOR ME I DIDN'T LAG BEHIND THE OTHERS AND I YIELDED TO NO ONE MY SHARE IN THESE DAILY OBSERVATIONS
CAPTAIN NEMO WASN'T CONTENT SIMPLY TO AVOID HUMANITY
AND BY NOW I WOULD HAVE CLASSIFIED MASTER'S FOSSILS
FISHERMEN AND SCIENTISTS WHY I TO WHOM YOU SPEAK CONSEIL SAID WITH THE WORLD'S STRAIGHTEST FACE I RECALL PERFECTLY SEEING A LARGE BOAT DRAGGED UNDER THE WAVES BY THE ARMS OF A CEPHALOPOD YOU SAW THAT THE CANADIAN ASKED
IT WAS A SIMPLE QUADRANGULAR PYRAMID SET ON A CORAL BASE WITH NO IRONWORK TO TEMPT THE NATIVES AVARICE
I ARRIVED AT THE CORNER DOOR OF THE LOUNGE
THE CAPTAIN GLANCED AT THE CHART
THERE THE GULF STREAM IS SEVENTY-FIVE MILES WIDE AND 210 METERS DEEP
THERE A CITY IN RUINS FLUNG TO THE GROUND BY CONVULSIONS IN THE EARTH
THE SEA WAS COVERED WITH MUTILATED CORPSES
ACCORDINGLY THAT DAY IT KEPT GETTING WORSE
SO THE SHIP COULD EASILY EXIT BY GOING EITHER AHEAD OR ASTERN SINKING A FEW HUNDRED METERS DEEPER AND THEN TAKING AN OPEN PASSAGEWAY BENEATH THE ICE BANK
I SAW NO MORE OF THE SMALL INTERVENING BILLOWS THAT FORM IN THE TROUGHS OF THE BIG CRESTS
THEN THE SHARK'S JAWS OPENED ASTOUNDINGLY WIDE LIKE A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL SHEARS AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FINISH OF CAPTAIN NEMO HAD NOT NED LAND QUICK AS THOUGHT RUSHED FORWARD WITH HIS HARPOON AND DRIVEN ITS DREADFUL POINT INTO THE SHARK'S UNDERSIDE
BUT TELL ME HAVEN'T YOU FINISHED CLASSIFYING THESE SUPERB SPECIMENS OF MARINE FAUNA MASTER IS WELL AWARE CONSEIL REPLIED THAT I'M NOT SEASONED IN PRACTICAL APPLICATION
WHAT'S YOUR REPLY IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE MATTER HAD TO BE SETTLED AND EVASIONS WERE DISTASTEFUL TO ME
WE STAYED ON WATCH BEFORE THE LOUNGE WINDOWS AND OUR NOTES ENABLE ME TO RECONSTRUCT IN A FEW WORDS THE ICHTHYOLOGY OF THIS SEA
I STARED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SHIP I HAD SPOTTED
THE ENTIRE CREW SUFFERED FROM A NERVOUS EXCITEMENT THAT IT'S BEYOND ME TO DESCRIBE
HEARTS POUNDING WE COULD SEE AND FEEL THE SHIP RIGHTING ITSELF
I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE DREADING YET DESIRING AN ENCOUNTER WITH CAPTAIN NEMO WANTING YET NOT WANTING TO SEE HIM
SO CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE HAD PUT TO SEA IN COMMAND OF A VESSEL NAMED AFTER THE ASTROLABE AND JUST TWO MONTHS AFTER DILLON HAD LEFT VANIKORO DUMONT D'URVILLE DROPPED ANCHOR BEFORE HOBART
CAPTAIN I REPLIED I'M ALL PRAISE FOR THIS IDEA YOU'RE PUTTING INTO EFFECT
IN A FEW MOMENTS WE HAD PUT ON OUR EQUIPMENT
CONSEIL ENTERED
THE CANNONEER FIRED A SHOT BUT HIS SHELL PASSED SOME FEET ABOVE THE CETACEAN WHICH STAYED HALF A MILE OFF
ALREADY I NO LONGER FELT THE BULKINESS OF MY CLOTHES FOOTWEAR AND AIR TANK NOR THE WEIGHT OF THE HEAVY SPHERE INSIDE WHICH MY HEAD WAS RATTLING LIKE AN ALMOND IN ITS SHELL
THE WHITE PETALS RETRACTED INTO THEIR RED SHEATHS THE FLOWERS VANISHED BEFORE MY EYES AND THE BUSH CHANGED INTO A CHUNK OF STONY NIPPLES
YOU OWN 6,000 OR 7,000 VOLUMES HERE 12,000 PROFESSOR ARONNAX
NEAR FOUR O'CLOCK CAPTAIN NEMO INFORMED ME THAT THE PLATFORM HATCHES WERE ABOUT TO BE CLOSED
STARFISH FEATHER STARS SEA LILIES FREE-SWIMMING CRINOIDS BRITTLE STARS SEA URCHINS SEA CUCUMBERS ETC REPRESENTED A COMPLETE COLLECTION OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN THIS GROUP
HIS BREATHING BECAME SHALLOW AND QUICK
THE HARBOR PILOT WENT DOWN INTO HIS DINGHY AND REJOINED A LITTLE SCHOONER WAITING FOR HIM TO LEEWARD
VOLCANIC
IT OWNS A PULSE AND ARTERIES IT HAS SPASMS AND I SIDE WITH THE SCHOLARLY COMMANDER MAURY WHO DISCOVERED THAT IT HAS A CIRCULATION AS REAL AS THE CIRCULATION OF BLOOD IN ANIMALS I'M SURE THAT CAPTAIN NEMO EXPECTED NO REPLIES FROM ME AND IT SEEMED POINTLESS TO PITCH IN WITH AH YES EXACTLY OR HOW RIGHT YOU ARE RATHER HE WAS SIMPLY TALKING TO HIMSELF WITH LONG PAUSES BETWEEN SENTENCES
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND WHY IS THAT SIR
AFTER RENEWING ITS AIR THE NAUTILUS STAYED AT AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF FIFTEEN METERS ENABLING IT TO RETURN QUICKLY TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
THE BAY OF VIGO 191 9
IS THIS BRAZEN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMING HE'LL TAKE US EVEN TO THAT LOCATION MEANWHILE THE CAPTAIN FELL SILENT AND STARED AT THE ELEMENT HE HAD STUDIED SO THOROUGHLY AND UNCEASINGLY
ITS DECK WAS COVERED WITH DARK QUIVERING SHADOWS
I COMPLIED
THE MAN WITH CALM GENTLE EYES LISTENED TO ME SERENELY EVEN COURTEOUSLY AND PAID REMARKABLE ATTENTION
CARRIED AWAY BY HIS VOLATILE TEMPERAMENT THE CANADIAN PUT GREAT ANIMATION INTO IT
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I PROMISED YOU A STROLL IN MY FORESTS I MADE NO PLEDGE TO ARRANGE FOR YOUR ENCOUNTERING A RESTAURANT THERE
THANKS TO THE PERFECTION OF OUR EQUIPMENT WE HAD THUS GONE NINETY METERS BELOW THE LIMIT THAT NATURE HAD UNTIL THEN SET ON MAN'S UNDERWATER EXCURSIONS
NO RIGGING TO BE WORN OUT BY ROLLING AND PITCHING ON THE WAVES
I HADN'T EVEN SUSPECTED
YOU'RE EXAMINING MY SHELLS PROFESSOR
NOW I ASK YOU AFTER IT HAD BEEN WOUNDED WEST OF AMERICA HOW COULD THIS ANIMAL BE KILLED IN THE EAST UNLESS IT HAD CLEARED THE EQUATOR AND DOUBLED CAPE HORN OR THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE I AGREE WITH OUR FRIEND NED CONSEIL SAID AND I'M WAITING TO HEAR HOW MASTER WILL REPLY TO HIM MASTER WILL REPLY MY FRIENDS THAT BALEEN WHALES ARE LOCALIZED ACCORDING TO SPECIES WITHIN CERTAIN SEAS THAT THEY NEVER LEAVE
RARELY HE ANSWERED ME
AS FOR THE EXHAUSTION BOUND TO ACCOMPANY A TWO-HOUR STROLL IN SUCH UNFAMILIAR TRAPPINGS--IT WAS NIL
IT WAS A LIVING MAN SWIMMING VIGOROUSLY SOMETIMES DISAPPEARING TO BREATHE AT THE SURFACE THEN INSTANTLY DIVING AGAIN
AT THE CAPTAIN'S SUMMONS TWO CREWMEN CAME TO HELP US PUT ON THESE HEAVY WATERPROOF CLOTHES MADE FROM SEAMLESS INDIA RUBBER AND EXPRESSLY DESIGNED TO BEAR CONSIDERABLE PRESSURES
THROUGH THE MISTS ON THE 27TH IT SIGHTED THE PORT OF HEART'S CONTENT
THE ONE DOESN'T EXCLUDE THE OTHER FINE CONSEIL
I WOULD BE DEAD FIRST
FINALLY HOW DO YOU KEEP YOUR SHIP AT WHATEVER LEVEL SUITS YOU
BROUGHT TO FULL SPEED THE PROPELLER MADE THE SHEET-IRON HULL TREMBLE DOWN TO ITS RIVETS AND WE SPED NORTHWARD
HOW MANY VICTIMS WERE SWEPT UNDER THE WAVES
SEE HE WENT ON
YET I'LL ASK YOU TO EXPLAIN HOW THESE CREATURES CAN LIVE AT SUCH DEPTHS I EXPLAIN IT ON TWO GROUNDS I REPLIED
IT'S GETTING CLOSER IT'S COMING INTO THE NAUTILUS'S WATERS THEN GOING ON WITH HIS CONVERSATION
HOWEVER LOOKING AT THE ZENITH DIRECTLY OVERHEAD I THOUGHT I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FEEBLE GLIMMER A SORT OF TWILIGHT FILTERING THROUGH A CIRCULAR HOLE
HE DID NOTHING OF THE SORT
HE DID NOTHING OF THE SORT
THE SECOND STRANDED TO LEEWARD HELD UP FOR SOME DAYS
IT STARTS BELOW SUEZ AND LEADS TO THE BAY OF PELUSIUM BUT ISN'T THAT ISTHMUS ONLY COMPOSED OF QUICKSAND TO A CERTAIN DEPTH
I SETTLED MY BILL AT THAT HUGE COUNTER THAT WAS ALWAYS UNDER SIEGE BY A CONSIDERABLE CROWD
WHAT FOR
THEY'LL BE USELESS TO US HE REPLIED
FINALLY THIS MASS OF SPERM WHALES THINNED OUT
OUR PATH WAS GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
WHY HAD OUR INCOMPREHENSIBLE GUIDE TAKEN US INTO THE DEPTHS OF THIS UNDERWATER CRYPT
GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A CALM VOICE THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DYING UNDER THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE'RE PLACED THIS INEXPLICABLE INDIVIDUAL ACTED LIKE A MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR WORKING OUT A PROBLEM FOR HIS PUPILS
ON THE 23RD SEVERAL OFFICERS CIRCLED THE ISLAND AND BROUGHT BACK SOME RUBBLE OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE
WHEN I ASKED
AFTER BEING CONFINED FOR OVER THIRTY HOURS HE AND CONSEIL WERE FINALLY OUT OF THIS CELL
A CONSIDERABLE BUT NECESSARY DRAIN ON THE NAUTILUS'S RESERVES
THE PRESENT TRANSLATION IS A FAITHFUL YET COMMUNICATIVE RENDERING OF THE ORIGINAL FRENCH TEXTS PUBLISHED IN PARIS BY J
HE HURLED AT THE HAPLESS ANIMAL THE MOST POTENT SWEARWORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
BY THEN WE HAD FARED 16,220 MILES OR 7,500 LEAGUES FROM OUR STARTING POINT IN THE SEAS OF JAPAN
HERE ITS GENERAL EFFECT SUGGESTED AN ORIENTAL TOWN WITH COUNTLESS MINARETS AND MOSQUES
AND WE HAVE OXYGEN IN THE AIR TANKS FOR ONLY TWO DAYS WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT NED ANSWERED THAT ONCE WE'RE OUT OF THIS DAMNED PRISON WE'LL STILL BE COOPED UP BENEATH THE ICE BANK WITHOUT ANY POSSIBLE CONTACT WITH THE OPEN AIR AN APT REMARK
I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW THIS MARVELOUS ELECTRIC FORCE NOT ONLY GAVE MOTION HEAT AND LIGHT TO THE NAUTILUS BUT EVEN PROTECTED IT AGAINST OUTSIDE ATTACK TRANSFORMING IT INTO A SACRED ARK NO PROFANE HAND COULD TOUCH WITHOUT BEING BLASTED
THIS'LL MEAN A DELAY NED SAID
HERE I RECOGNIZE NO SUPERIORS
NO BOILERS FOR STEAM TO BURST OPEN
WHY I THOUGHT COD WERE FLAT LIKE DAB OR SOLE INNOCENT BOY I EXCLAIMED
THIS TOWING ROLE WAS TO LAST NO LONGER THAN TEN MINUTES AND BY RELIEVING EACH OTHER IN THIS WAY WE COULD STAY AFLOAT FOR HOURS PERHAPS EVEN UNTIL DAYBREAK
DISAPPOINTMENT AND ANGER
ITS SURFACE AREA 24,448 SQUARE MILES IN OTHER WORDS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THAT OF IRELAND
WHEN IT ROSE BRIEFLY TO THE SURFACE TO RENEW OUR AIR THE HATCHES OPENED AND CLOSED AS IF AUTOMATED
IT ADOPTED A MEDIUM PACE SOMETIMES STAYING ON THE SURFACE SOMETIMES DIVING TO AVOID SOME SHIP AND SO I COULD OBSERVE BOTH THE INSIDE AND TOPSIDE OF THIS HIGHLY UNUSUAL SEA
AN ENGLISH FOOT IS ONLY 30.4 CENTIMETERS
AN ENGLISH FOOT IS ONLY 30.4 CENTIMETERS
IT GAZED WITH ENORMOUS STARING EYES THAT WERE TINTED SEA GREEN
FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON 1865 AND HECTOR SERVADAC 1877 DEAL IN SPACE TRAVEL WHILE JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH FEATURES TRAVEL TO THE EARTH'S CORE
OH WELL THE CANADIAN SAID WE'LL GIVE HIM THE SLIP LONG BEFORE THEN IN ANY EVENT CONSEIL ADDED HE'S A SUPERMAN THAT CAPTAIN NEMO AND WE'LL NEVER REGRET HAVING KNOWN HIM ESPECIALLY ONCE WE'VE LEFT HIM NED LAND SHOT BACK
BUT HE SEEMED TO BRUSH IT ASIDE
OUR BEACON IS ABOUT TO GO ON AND IF YOU WANT SOME LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT YOU'LL BE SATISFIED I SET FOOT ON THE PLATFORM AND WAITED
THE CAPTAIN STOPPED SUDDENLY
AS FOR ME WHAT HAD HARROWED MY HEART IN THE THICK OF THIS STRUGGLE WAS THE DESPAIRING YELL GIVEN BY THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN
THERE I PUT THIS RARE EGG INSIDE ONE OF THE GLASS CASES IN THE MUSEUM
ITS VARIETY WAS INFINITE
THE SOUTH POLE CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED IN A SOLEMN VOICE HANDING ME THE SPYGLASS WHICH SHOWED THE ORB OF DAY CUT INTO TWO EXACTLY EQUAL PARTS BY THE HORIZON
WE WERE NOT 100 FEET FROM THE BLAZING CORE OF LIGHT WHOSE GLOW GREW STRONGER AND DAZZLED THE EYES
HAZY FLICKERINGS WERE REFLECTED ON ITS RIGGING AND INDICATED THAT ITS FURNACES WERE PUSHED TO THE LIMIT
IT WAS THEN DRAWING 6.7 METERS OF WATER AND DISPLACING 6,624 CUBIC METERS
ATLANTIS WHAT LIGHTNING FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND
NO HELP HE REPLIED WITH GROWING ANIMATION
IF THEY'RE AGREEABLE WE'RE YOURS TO COMMAND CAPTAIN THEN KINDLY PUT ON YOUR DIVING SUITS AS FOR THE DEAD OR DYING MAN HE HADN'T COME INTO THE PICTURE
THEIR COATS WERE SHORT AND LESS THAN ABUNDANT
YOU SLID ON YOUR KNEES YOU CREPT ON YOUR BELLY
IF THE NAUTILUS WAS SUBMERGED DURING THESE LOSSES OF BALANCE WE HEARD THE RESULTING NOISES SPREAD UNDER THE WATERS WITH FRIGHTFUL INTENSITY AND THE COLLAPSE OF THESE MASSES CREATED DAUNTING EDDIES DOWN TO THE OCEAN'S LOWER STRATA
GEESE AND DUCK ALIGHTED BY THE DOZENS ON THE PLATFORM AND SOON TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE SHIP'S PANTRY
THOSE REPORTS FROM THE SHANNON AND THE HELVETIA HAD SLIGHTLY EXAGGERATED ITS DIMENSIONS AND I PUT ITS LENGTH AT ONLY 250 FEET
IT WAS ELEVEN IN THE MORNING
HE TRIED TO REACH VANIKORO WHERE ACCORDING TO THE NATIVE BOATMAN A GOOD DEAL OF RUBBLE FROM THE SHIPWRECK COULD STILL BE FOUND BUT WINDS AND CURRENTS PREVENTED HIS DOING SO
IT WAS TOO LATE TO TAKE ACTION
ALL AT ONCE HIS ARM SHOT FORWARD AND THE HARPOON WAS LAUNCHED
IN MOST PLACES THEY EARN ONLY A PENNY FOR EACH OYSTER THAT HAS A PEARL AND THEY BRING UP SO MANY THAT HAVE NONE ONLY ONE PENNY TO THOSE POOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYERS RICH
OUR BOAT CRUISED ALONG A FEW MILES AWAY FROM THAT DAUNTING SHOAL WHERE CAPTAIN COOK'S SHIPS WELLNIGH MISCARRIED ON JUNE 10 1770
BY WATER IN THE MIDST OF WATER
THIS FAMILY PRODUCES BOTH THE BIGGEST AND SMALLEST VEGETABLES IN THE WORLD
SEVERAL TIMES I THOUGHT THE NAUTILUS WAS ABOUT TO ATTACK
ITS PROPELLER CHURNED THE WAVES WITH LAZY MAJESTY
BUT NOT THAT OF A CIVILIZED MAN PROFESSOR THE COMMANDER REPLIED SWIFTLY I'M NOT WHAT YOU TERM A CIVILIZED MAN
THERE I WOULD ENCOUNTER HIM ONE LAST TIME
IN FACT BY ESTABLISHING A CIRCUIT BETWEEN TWO WIRES IMMERSED TO DIFFERENT DEPTHS I'D BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE DIVERGING TEMPERATURES THEY EXPERIENCE
I NOTED THAT WE DIDN'T FOLLOW THE SAME PATH IN RETURNING TO THE NAUTILUS
SOON AFTER AN EXPLOSION STRUCK MY EARS
THOSE ARE SPERM WHALES DREADFUL ANIMALS THAT I'VE SOMETIMES ENCOUNTERED IN HERDS OF 200 OR 300
IT WAS FUTILE TO ATTACK THE CEILING SINCE THAT SURFACE WAS THE ICE BANK ITSELF MORE THAN 400 METERS HIGH
HERE HOWEVER OUR OVERRIDING NEED WAS TO MAKE OURSELVES UNDERSTOOD
ITS MASTHEADS APPEARED LADEN WITH VICTIMS THEN ITS CROSSTREES BENDING UNDER CLUSTERS OF MEN FINALLY THE PEAK OF ITS MAINMAST
BUT SINCE I HAD NO HOPE OF STUDYING THESE ZOOPHYTES IN THE SEAPORTS OF THE LEVANT FROM WHICH WE WERE SEPARATED BY THE INSUPERABLE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ I HAD TO BE CONTENT WITH OBSERVING THEM IN THE WATERS OF THE RED SEA
I SPOTTED JIDDA AN IMPORTANT FINANCIAL CENTER FOR EGYPT SYRIA TURKEY AND THE EAST INDIES
IN THE FACE OF THIS IMMINENT NEW DANGER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR CHANCES FOR SALVATION AND HOW COULD WE PREVENT THIS LIQUID MEDIUM FROM SOLIDIFYING THEN CRACKING THE NAUTILUS'S HULL LIKE GLASS
IN AN INSTANT THE FRIGATE'S DECK WOULD BECOME DENSELY POPULATED
THE MOUNTAINS WERE CHANGING BACK INTO PLAINS
IT WAS A SONOROUS HARMONIOUS FLEXIBLE DIALECT WHOSE VOWELS SEEMED TO UNDERGO A HIGHLY VARIED ACCENTUATION
THEY RESEMBLE SHARKS WITHOUT EQUALING THEIR STRENGTH AND ARE ENCOUNTERED IN EVERY SEA
CAPTAIN NEMO WAS THERE
CAPTAIN NEMO WAS THERE
BUT D'ENTRECASTEAUX WAS UNAWARE OF THIS NEWS--WHICH SEEMED A BIT DUBIOUS ANYHOW--AND HEADED TOWARD THE ADMIRALTY ISLANDS WHICH HAD BEEN NAMED IN A REPORT BY ONE CAPTAIN HUNTER AS THE SITE OF THE COUNT DE LA PéROUSE'S SHIPWRECK
IF THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY MEN ON BOARD THIS MACHINE I DON'T THINK THEY CAN STAVE OFF TWO FRENCHMEN AND A CANADIAN IT SEEMED WISER TO ACCEPT THE HARPOONER'S PROPOSITION THAN TO DEBATE IT
IT TOOK PULLEYS OF GREAT STRENGTH TO HOIST THIS DUGONG ONTO THE PLATFORM
BUT THAT MEANT THIS STRANGE VOYAGE OF MINE WOULD COME TO AN END AND NO SUCH END WAS IN SIGHT
ITS SUMMIT OBVIOUSLY POKED ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE OCEAN
WE EMBRACED EACH OTHER HEARTILY
MY STUBBORN COMPANION HADN'T GRANTED ME THIS COURTESY
GENERALLY THESE SAVAGES WERE NAKED
THE POSITIONS REPORTED EACH DAY ON THE WORLD MAP WERE PUT THERE BY THE CHIEF OFFICER AND THEY ENABLED ME TO DETERMINE THE NAUTILUS'S EXACT HEADING
THE ENTIRE DAY PASSED WITHOUT MY BEING HONORED BY A VISIT FROM CAPTAIN NEMO
AND IF THESE PIRATES--I SAY PIRATES OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR THE PROFESSOR'S FEELINGS SINCE HE DOESN'T WANT US TO CALL THEM CANNIBALS IF THESE PIRATES THINK THEY'RE GOING TO SMOTHER ME IN THIS CAGE WITHOUT HEARING WHAT CUSSWORDS SPICE UP MY OUTBURSTS THEY'VE GOT ANOTHER THINK COMING
BUT A LAVA FLOW WHICH CONTAINS IN ITSELF THE PRINCIPLE OF ITS INCANDESCENCE CAN RISE TO A WHITE HEAT OVERPOWER THE LIQUID ELEMENT AND TURN IT INTO STEAM ON CONTACT
ARISTOTLE ATHENAEUS PLINY AND OPPIAN STUDIED ITS HABITS AND LAVISHED ON ITS BEHALF ALL THE SCIENTIFIC POETRY OF GREECE AND ITALY
WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY OUR GALVANIC RAYS ON THESE HUGE WHIMSICALLY SCULPTED BLOCKS WHOSE EVERY ANGLE RIDGE AND FACET GAVE OFF A DIFFERENT GLOW DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE VEINS RUNNING INSIDE THE ICE
HE WOULD DIVE AND GO BACK UP IN QUICK SUCCESSION
IN THIS LONG BLACKISH OBJECT ADVANCING FLUSH WITH THE WATER DIDN'T THEY SEE SOME FEARSOME CETACEAN THAT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO VIEW WITH DISTRUST
BUT WHAT'S YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF HIS CONDITION I HESITATED TO SPEAK MY MIND
I WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN THE STEEP SLOPES OF THIS MOUNTAIN CROSSED THIS ENTIRE IMMENSE CONTINENT WHICH SURELY CONNECTS AFRICA WITH AMERICA AND VISITED ITS GREAT PREHISTORIC CITIES
FORTUNATELY I CONTROLLED MYSELF AND STRETCHED OUT ON THE BED TO SOOTHE MY BODILY AGITATION
LITTLE BY LITTLE VEGETATION SPREAD
BY SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING WE WERE BACK ON THE BEACH
GOOD LADS THE CANADIAN MUTTERED
ONCE WE WERE ABOARD THAT SHIP IF WE COULDN'T WARD OFF THE BLOW THAT THREATENED IT AT LEAST WE COULD DO EVERYTHING THAT CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED
SUDDENLY MY CLOTHES WERE SEIZED BY ENERGETIC HANDS I FELT MYSELF PULLED ABRUPTLY BACK TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND YES I HEARD THESE WORDS PRONOUNCED IN MY EAR
OUR VISITORS DIDN'T BAT AN EYE
WELL LOOK HERE
IT WAS SIX O'CLOCK
ALL THAT'S LACKING IS FOR THEM TO BE CANNIBALS
IN 1785 THE COUNT DE LA PéROUSE AND HIS SUBORDINATE CAPTAIN DE LANGLE WERE SENT BY KING LOUIS XVI OF FRANCE ON A VOYAGE TO CIRCUMNAVIGATE THE GLOBE
I'LL NEVER PROMISE I WON'T TRY GETTING OUT OF HERE I DIDN'T ASK FOR SUCH A PROMISE MR LAND THE COMMANDER REPLIED COLDLY
SOMETIMES IT STOOD ON END THE THREE OF US ALONG WITH IT
SEVERAL SEAMEN WERE WITH HIM
MASTER IS FAMILIAR WITH THE SHIP'S CAPACITY HENCE THE AMOUNT OF AIR IT CONTAINS
SOMETIMES I CAST MY NETS IN OUR WAKE AND I PULL THEM UP READY TO BURST
AN UNDERWATER TUNNEL HE EXCLAIMED
THE NAUTILUS PROCEEDED TO MIDWATER
AND DO YOU KNOW I ADDED WHAT HAPPENED SINCE MAN HAS ALMOST COMPLETELY WIPED OUT THESE BENEFICIAL RACES
SO WHERE YOU GO I'LL GO CAPTAIN NEMO LED ME TO THE NAUTILUS'S STERN AND PASSING BY NED AND CONSEIL'S CABIN I SUMMONED MY TWO COMPANIONS WHO INSTANTLY FOLLOWED US
THEY WERE NO MORE DISTURBED BY THE PRESENCE OF THESE MAN-EATERS THAN SOLDIERS IN AN ARMORED FORTRESS ARE TROUBLED BY ANTS RUNNING OVER THE ARMOR PLATE
ITS EIGHT ARMS OR MORE ACCURATELY FEET WERE ROOTED IN ITS HEAD WHICH HAS EARNED THESE ANIMALS THE NAME CEPHALOPOD
THIS WAS THE UNDERPINNING OF CRESPO ISLAND
THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN STAYED AT HALF STEAM ADVANCING CAUTIOUSLY SO AS NOT TO AWAKEN ITS ADVERSARY
BUT NO EXPRESSION OF THANKS COULD REPAY THEM FULLY FOR SUCH DEVOTION
DRIVEN FORWARD BY ITS POWERFUL PROPELLER THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE ANIMAL
I COULD DISTINGUISH WITH REASONABLE CLARITY THE OVERALL EFFECT OF ITS BUILDINGS THE SHIPS MADE FAST ALONG ITS WHARVES AND THOSE BIGGER VESSELS WHOSE DRAFT OF WATER REQUIRED THEM TO DROP ANCHOR AT THE PORT'S OFFSHORE MOORING
IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT BEARS IN THE SWISS MOUNTAINS YOU MIGHT SAY
JUST THEN THERE WAS A COLLISION IN THE NAUTILUS'S BOW
HIS RIGID BODY CLENCHED FISTS AND HEAD DRAWN BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS ALL ATTESTED TO A FIERCE HATE BREATHING FROM EVERY PORE
IN THE ROUQUAYROL DEVICE THAT HAS BEEN IN GENERAL USE TWO INDIA-RUBBER HOSES LEAVE THIS BOX AND FEED TO A KIND OF TENT THAT IMPRISONS THE OPERATOR'S NOSE AND MOUTH
THE SCOTIA HADN'T RUN AFOUL OF SOMETHING IT HAD BEEN FOULED AND BY A CUTTING OR PERFORATING INSTRUMENT RATHER THAN A BLUNT ONE
WHAT WAS THIS ASTOUNDING WORLD THAT I DIDN'T YET KNOW
DIDN'T MASTER SEE THAT THIS MAN-EATER INITIATED THE ATTACK A SHELL ISN'T WORTH A HUMAN LIFE I TOLD HIM
THE SILENCE WAS FURTHER DISTURBED ONLY BY THE POUNDING OF MY HEART
GEORGE WASHINGTON FOUNDER OF THE AMERICAN UNION
FISH ROSE IN A BODY AT OUR FEET LIKE BIRDS STARTLED IN TALL GRASS
FROM THAT DAY TO THIS SUCH PLUTONIC CONSTRUCTION WORK HAS BEEN IN ABEYANCE
CONSEIL COULD STILL ARTICULATE A FEW WORDS AND I HEARD HIM REPEAT AT INTERVALS
THERE DILLON COLLECTED MANY RELICS OF THE SHIPWRECK
IN THESE ANTARCTIC DISTRICTS AS IS WELL KNOWN SIR JAMES CLARK ROSS HAD FOUND THE CRATERS OF MT
IN ESSENCE IT WAS AN ISSUE OF STOCKING THE LARDER WITH EXCELLENT RED MEAT EVEN BETTER THAN BEEF OR VEAL
THE MERCURY IS NEVER DEPLETED
AFTER CLEARING THE OUTER BELT OF ROCKS VIA A NARROW PASSAGEWAY THE NAUTILUS LAY INSIDE THE BREAKERS WHERE THE SEA HAD A DEPTH OF THIRTY TO FORTY FATHOMS
PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE TOLD ME THIS CALLS FOR HEROIC MEASURES OR WE'LL BE SEALED UP IN THIS SOLIDIFIED WATER AS IF IT WERE CEMENT YES I SAID
THE OARS WERE INSIDE THE LONGBOAT AND WE HAD ONLY TO TAKE OUR SEATS
AFTER BREAKFAST NEAR TEN O'CLOCK WE WENT DOWN ONTO THE EMBANKMENT
DID MASTER SLEEP WELL CONSEIL ASKED ME WITH HIS PERENNIAL GOOD MANNERS
IT WAS I WHO WAS SWEEPING HIM TO THE POLE
JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO REPAIR TO MY STATEROOM THE CAPTAIN STOPPED ME
AND ONE ODD DETAIL
THAT DAY THE NAUTILUS CROSSED AN ODD PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
WAS HE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF FRANCE IN THIS MYSTERIOUS ALLIANCE OBVIOUSLY MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES
THEY PROVIDED THE NAUTILUS WITH AN ESCORT AND I COULD HEAR THEIR BEAKS GNASHING ON THE SHEET-IRON HULL
THE WIND SHIFTED TO EVERY POINT OF THE HORIZON AND THE CYCLONE LEFT THE EAST TO RETURN THERE AFTER PASSING THROUGH NORTH WEST AND SOUTH MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF REVOLVING STORMS IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
IF IT WERE FULLY LANDLOCKED LIKE A LAKE THIS ODD GULF MIGHT DRY UP COMPLETELY
TRUE TODAY'S SCIENTISTS KNOW A FEW THINGS HE DIDN'T
THE NAUTILUS PASSED THE WIDE ESTUARY FORMED BY THE MOUTH OF THE RIO DE LA PLATA AND ON APRIL 4 WE LAY ABREAST OF URUGUAY ALBEIT FIFTY MILES OUT
ABOUT 300 METERS DOWN JUST AS CAPTAIN NEMO HAD PREDICTED WE CRUISED BENEATH THE UNDULATING SURFACE OF THE ICE BANK
THE NAUTILUS KEPT DESCENDING
I WANTED TO SEE THE LOUNGE ONE LAST TIME
ALSO DISCREDITED WAS THE IDEA OF A FLOATING HULL OR SOME OTHER ENORMOUS WRECKAGE AND AGAIN BECAUSE OF THIS SPEED OF MOVEMENT
EACH OF THEM CARRIED ON HIS BACK A ROUQUAYROL DEVICE THAT THE AIR TANKS HAD SUPPLIED WITH A GENEROUS ALLOWANCE OF FRESH OXYGEN
LITTLE BY LITTLE HOPES I HAD ENTERTAINED AFTER OUR INTERVIEW WITH THE SHIP'S COMMANDER WERE FADING AWAY
THEY WERE MIGRATING FROM THE TEMPERATE ZONES TOWARD ZONES STILL WARMER FOLLOWING THE ITINERARIES OF HERRING AND SARDINES
AND TO COMPLETE THE ILLUSION MINNOWS FLITTED FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH LIKE A SWARM OF HUMMINGBIRDS WHILE THERE ROSE UNDERFOOT LIKE A COVEY OF SNIPE YELLOW FISH FROM THE GENUS LEPISOCANTHUS WITH BRISTLING JAWS AND SHARP SCALES FLYING GURNARDS AND PINECONE FISH
THERE'S A POWERFUL OBEDIENT SWIFT AND EFFORTLESS FORCE THAT CAN BE BENT TO ANY USE AND WHICH REIGNS SUPREME ABOARD MY VESSEL
THEN LADEN WITH THESE VALUABLE SPOILS THE MEN RETURNED TO THE NAUTILUS DROPPED OFF THEIR BURDENS INSIDE AND WENT TO RESUME THIS INEXHAUSTIBLE FISHING FOR SILVER AND GOLD
NEVERTHELESS CONSEIL KEPT TOWING ME
THEREFORE LET'S CONCENTRATE ON OUR CHANCES OF BEING CRUSHED OR ASPHYXIATED AS FOR ASPHYXIATION CAPTAIN I REPLIED THAT ISN'T A CAUSE FOR ALARM BECAUSE THE AIR TANKS ARE FULL TRUE CAPTAIN NEMO WENT ON BUT THEY'LL SUPPLY AIR FOR ONLY TWO DAYS
I RECEIVED NO REPLY
OUR EXCLAMATIONS WERE ENDLESS
LOOK AT IT STEALING AWAY PEOPLE CLAIM THESE ANIMALS CAN CIRCLE AROUND THE WORLD IN JUST FIFTEEN DAYS I DON'T SAY NAY BUT WHAT YOU UNDOUBTEDLY DON'T KNOW PROFESSOR ARONNAX IS THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD WHALES TRAVELED EVEN QUICKER OH REALLY NED
NOW THEN AT THE SPOT INDICATED ON THE WORLD MAP ONE OF THESE SEAGOING RIVERS WAS ROLLING BY THE KUROSHIO OF THE JAPANESE THE BLACK CURRENT
NOTE WELL MY FINE CANADIAN I WENT ON IF SUCH AN ANIMAL EXISTS IF IT LIVES DEEP IN THE OCEAN IF IT FREQUENTS THE LIQUID STRATA LOCATED MILES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER IT NEEDS TO HAVE A CONSTITUTION SO SOLID IT DEFIES ALL COMPARISON AND WHY THIS POWERFUL CONSTITUTION NED ASKED
BUT USUALLY THE SHELLFISH ARE SPREAD OUT ON MATS MADE FROM THE ESPARTO GRASS THAT COVERS THE BEACHES
INTRODUCTION THE DEEPEST PARTS OF THE OCEAN ARE TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO US ADMITS PROFESSOR ARONNAX EARLY IN THIS NOVEL
I WAS MULLING THIS OVER WHEN THE CAPTAIN APPROACHED COOL AND CALM FOREVER IN CONTROL OF HIMSELF LOOKING NEITHER ALARMED NOR ANNOYED
ANATOMICALLY IT'S DISTINGUISHED FROM THE WHITE WHALE AND THE BLACK RIGHT WHALE BY THE FUSION OF ITS SEVEN CERVICAL VERTEBRAE AND IT NUMBERS TWO MORE RIBS THAN ITS RELATIVES
ACCORDINGLY WHEN I HAVE A MIND TO VISIT THE OCEAN DEPTHS TWO OR THREE VERTICAL LEAGUES BENEATH THE SURFACE I USE MANEUVERS THAT ARE MORE TIME-CONSUMING BUT NO LESS INFALLIBLE WHAT ARE THEY CAPTAIN I ASKED
THE NUTRITIOUS FOOD LIFE-GIVING AIR REGULAR ROUTINE AND UNIFORM TEMPERATURE KEPT ILLNESS AT BAY
BUT THERE WAS A PERFECTLY NATURAL REPLY TO THESE CHARGES AND I MADE IT
CONCLUSION 299 COLOR PLATES FACING PAGE THE BAY OF VIGO
THE ENGINEER RACED OVER
YOU ALREADY GLIMPSE THE POTENTIAL--MYSELF I'D SAY THE SUCCESS--OF THIS ATTEMPT
I'M UNABLE TO DEPICT IT
NOBODY WILL EVER MAKE ME BELIEVE NED LAND SAID THAT SUCH ANIMALS EXIST WHY NOT CONSEIL REPLIED
I HOPED TO ENCOUNTER CAPTAIN NEMO THERE--WOULD HE COME
SECUNDO THE SELACIANS WITH GILLS RESEMBLING THOSE OF THE CYCLOSTOMES BUT WHOSE LOWER JAW IS FREE-MOVING
THIS WAS PERFECTLY TRUE BUT WE HAD NEARLY FORGOTTEN THE FACT
I GAPED
AND IMPATIENCE GREW UNTIL ON JUNE 2 WORD CAME THAT THE TAMPICO A STEAMER ON THE SAN FRANCISCO LINE SAILING FROM CALIFORNIA TO SHANGHAI HAD SIGHTED THE ANIMAL AGAIN THREE WEEKS BEFORE IN THE NORTHERLY SEAS OF THE PACIFIC
AMONG THE BRACHYURA CONSEIL MENTIONS SOME AMANTHIA CRABS WHOSE FRONTS WERE ARMED WITH TWO BIG DIVERGING TIPS THOSE INACHUS SCORPIONS THAT LORD KNOWS WHY--SYMBOLIZED WISDOM TO THE ANCIENT GREEKS SPIDER CRABS OF THE MASSENA AND SPINIMANE VARIETIES THAT HAD PROBABLY GONE ASTRAY IN THESE SHALLOWS BECAUSE THEY USUALLY LIVE IN THE LOWER DEPTHS XANTHID CRABS PILUMNA CRABS RHOMBOID CRABS GRANULAR BOX CRABS EASY ON THE DIGESTION AS CONSEIL VENTURED TO OBSERVE TOOTHLESS MASKED CRABS EBALIA CRABS CYMOPOLIA CRABS WOOLLY-HANDED CRABS ETC
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF HE SAID I ONCE GOT WALLOPED BY A WHALE'S TAIL IN MY LONGBOAT NEEDLESS TO SAY
I'M ABLE TO DESCRIBE THIS STRUGGLE OF THE ELEMENTS BECAUSE CAPTAIN NEMO DIDN'T FLEE INTO THE OCEAN DEPTHS
THE BEACHED SKIFF HAD BROUGHT THE CAPTAIN ASHORE
THE SOUL OF A FLOWER IS ITS SCENT AND THOSE SPLENDID WATER PLANTS FLOWERS OF THE SEA HAVE NO SOULS
IN 1853 THE CUNARD CO WHOSE MAIL-CARRYING CHARTER HAD JUST BEEN RENEWED SUCCESSIVELY ADDED TO ITS ASSETS THE ARABIA THE PERSIA THE CHINA THE SCOTIA THE JAVA AND THE RUSSIA ALL SHIPS OF TOP SPEED AND AFTER THE GREAT EASTERN THE BIGGEST EVER TO PLOW THE SEAS
ATTAINING A WHITE HEAT IN THE GULF OF MEXICO IT HEADS NORTH UP THE AMERICAN COAST ADVANCES AS FAR AS NEWFOUNDLAND SWERVES AWAY UNDER THE THRUST OF A COLD CURRENT FROM THE DAVIS STRAIT AND RESUMES ITS OCEAN COURSE BY GOING ALONG A GREAT CIRCLE OF THE EARTH ON A RHUMB LINE
HOWEVER NEAR MIDNIGHT IT DISAPPEARED OR TO USE A MORE APPROPRIATE EXPRESSION IT WENT OUT LIKE A HUGE GLOWWORM
SO BE IT
COMMANDER FARRAGUT HAS A CABIN AT YOUR DISPOSAL
MY NERVES CALMED A LITTLE BUT WITH MY BRAIN SO AROUSED I DID A SWIFT REVIEW OF MY WHOLE EXISTENCE ABOARD THE NAUTILUS EVERY PLEASANT OR UNPLEASANT INCIDENT THAT HAD CROSSED MY PATH SINCE I WENT OVERBOARD FROM THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
YOUR CAPTAIN'S A POWERFUL MAN BUT DAMNATION HE ISN'T MORE POWERFUL THAN NATURE
BUT AT MERELY FIFTY METERS ONE ENCOUNTERS A FIRM FOUNDATION OF ROCK AND IT'S BY LUCK THAT YOU DISCOVERED THIS PASSAGEWAY I ASKED MORE AND MORE STARTLED
AND WHETHER HE WANTS TO OR NOT WE'LL HEAD NORTH AGAIN IN OTHER WORDS TO THE LAND OF SENSIBLE PEOPLE I HAD TO AGREE THAT NED LAND WAS RIGHT AND UNTIL SHIPS ARE BUILT TO NAVIGATE OVER TRACTS OF ICE THEY'LL HAVE TO STOP AT THE ICE BANK
WITH A GESTURE HE ORDERED US TO CROUCH BESIDE HIM AT THE FOOT OF A WIDE CREVICE
WOULD FATE BRING ME INTO HIS PRESENCE BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE
THE TRELLIS WENTLETRAP SNAIL FROM TRANQUEBAR ON INDIA'S EASTERN SHORE
BUT THIS HARD SUBSTANCE COULD HAVE BEEN A BONY CARAPACE LIKE THOSE THAT COVERED SOME PREHISTORIC ANIMALS AND I MIGHT HAVE LEFT IT AT THAT AND CLASSIFIED THIS MONSTER AMONG SUCH AMPHIBIOUS REPTILES AS TURTLES OR ALLIGATORS
MY COMPANIONS AND I WERE LAUNCHED TO AN ALTITUDE OF SIX METERS
NOT A SINGLE DETAIL WAS VISIBLE
DURING THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 16-17 WE ENTERED THE SECOND MEDITERRANEAN BASIN WHOSE MAXIMUM DEPTH WE FOUND AT 3,000 METERS
HIS HANDS WERE READY TO HURL A HARPOON
YOU TALK WAY OFF IN THE FUTURE
THE THERMOMETER ROSE AGAIN
AFTER NIGHTFALL THE STORM GREW IN INTENSITY
BUT DOES THIS MEAN THE OLD BOY GOES ASHORE NED LAND WENT ON
NOW THAT WE'RE IN MINE I INTEND TO SPEAK UP
HAVE A SEAT HE ADDED AND I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT AN UNUSUAL EPISODE IN THIS BODY OF HISTORY THE CAPTAIN STRETCHED OUT ON A COUCH AND I MECHANICALLY TOOK A SEAT NEAR HIM BUT HALF IN THE SHADOWS
AS FOR THE LIQUID SURFACE OF THE SEA THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY SEMBLANCE OF IT BEFORE OUR EYES
THEN ALL TRACES OF LIGHT VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS
CONSEIL AND I WERE MARVELING AT THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME
DESPITE ITS VIOLENT CANNONADE CAPTAIN NEMO HADN'T APPEARED ON THE PLATFORM
YES THIS HAD TO BE THE CASE AND UNDOUBTEDLY THEY WERE NOW CHASING THIS DREADFUL ENGINE OF DESTRUCTION ON EVERY SEA
THEN CHANGING SPEED TO TAKE THE BUOY-MARKED CHANNEL THAT CURVED INTO THE INNER BAY FORMED BY THE SPIT OF SANDY HOOK IT HUGGED THIS SAND-COVERED STRIP OF LAND WHERE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS ACCLAIMED US ONE MORE TIME
BUT HE HAD SCARCELY UNSCREWED THE NUTS WHEN THE HATCH FLEW UP WITH TREMENDOUS VIOLENCE OBVIOUSLY PULLED OPEN BY THE SUCKERS ON A DEVILFISH'S ARM
FOR WHAT PURPOSE
I COULD PUT YOU BACK ON THE PLATFORM OF THIS SHIP THAT HAS SERVED AS YOUR REFUGE
I'M SUFFOCATING THE CANADIAN WAS OBVIOUSLY AT THE END OF HIS PATIENCE
THE SKIFF IS ATTACHED TO THE TOPSIDE OF THE NAUTILUS'S HULL AND IS SET IN A CAVITY EXPRESSLY DESIGNED TO RECEIVE IT
BUT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR SLUMBER THE STEWARD HAD CLEARED THE TABLE
ONE UNUSUAL DETAIL
THE FIRST STROKE OF ITS HAMMER ON THE CHIME SNAPPED ME OUT OF MY MUSINGS
THE CANADIAN SHOUTED AND PLEADED BUT TO NO AVAIL
INDEED WERE WE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER THE NARWHALE IN SUCH A CRAMPED STRAIT
SO IT WAS EVEN BIGGER THAN THOSE FINE GIANT CLAMS GIVEN TO KING FRANçOIS I BY THE REPUBLIC OF VENICE AND WHICH THE CHURCH OF SAINT-SULPICE IN PARIS HAS MADE INTO TWO GIGANTIC HOLY-WATER FONTS
PERHAPS THIS IS THE SAME AS THE ALECTO'S CONSEIL SAID
LET'S WAIT FOR DAYLIGHT AND THEN WE'LL PLAY A DIFFERENT ROLE YOU'VE NO FURTHER DOUBTS COMMANDER AS TO THE NATURE OF THIS ANIMAL NO SIR IT'S APPARENTLY A GIGANTIC NARWHALE AND AN ELECTRIC ONE TO BOOT MAYBE I ADDED IT'S NO MORE APPROACHABLE THAN AN ELECTRIC EEL OR AN ELECTRIC RAY RIGHT THE COMMANDER REPLIED
THESE GLASS CAPSULES ARE COVERED WITH A STRIP OF STEEL AND WEIGHTED WITH A LEAD BASE
KEEPING TO ITS NORTHERLY HEADING IT FOLLOWED THE LONG WINDINGS OF SOUTH AMERICA
AS I SAID CAPTAIN NEMO WEPT WHILE STARING AT THE WAVES
CAPTAIN NEMO I SAID I'LL VOUCH FOR THE RESULTS AND NOT TRY TO EXPLAIN THEM
IN ANY CASE COMPARING THIS PEARL TO OTHERS I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT AND TO THOSE SHIMMERING IN THE CAPTAIN'S COLLECTION I ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS WORTH AT LEAST 10,000,000 FRANCS
TO CATCH IT CALLED FOR HARPOONING IT WHICH WAS NED LAND'S BUSINESS
BUT THE DEPTHS WERE DESERTED
CONSEIL DID LIKEWISE
THE WEATHER IS CLEARING A BIT HE TOLD ME
AN HOUR LATER WE WERE AT 13,000 METERS ABOUT THREE AND A QUARTER VERTICAL LEAGUES--AND THE OCEAN FLOOR WAS NOWHERE IN SIGHT
WHO KNOWS WHETHER THEY MIGHT BE LISTENING TO US
AN ELECTRIC WIRE CONNECTS ME TO THE SHIP
THERE ONCE MORE THROUGH THE PANELS OPENING INTO THESE CARIBBEAN WATERS TEN METERS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES I FOUND SO MANY FASCINATING EXHIBITS TO DESCRIBE IN MY DAILY NOTES
IT SPLIT THE BARRIER LITTLE BY LITTLE BACKING UP THEN PUTTING ON FULL SPEED AGAINST THE PUNCTURED TRACT OF ICE
FLORA AND FAUNA ARE SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATED IN THE UNDERWATER WORLD
THOSE PILES OF STONES JUST MENTIONED WERE LAID OUT ON THE OCEAN FLOOR WITH A DISTINCT BUT INEXPLICABLE SYMMETRY
AS THEY GRADUALLY UNROLLED THIS THIRD CABLE THE ELECTRICIANS OBSERVED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT SOMEONE HAD RECENTLY DRIVEN NAILS INTO IT TRYING TO DAMAGE ITS CORE
HIS FACIAL FEATURES EXPRESSED PROFOUND SADNESS REAL CHAGRIN
NOW THEN IT'S THIS SODIUM THAT I EXTRACT FROM SALT WATER AND WITH WHICH I COMPOSE MY ELECTRIC CELLS SODIUM YES SIR
LIKE CERTAIN FLOCKS OF BIRDS WHOSE SPEED THEY EQUAL THESE TUNA SWIM IN TRIANGLE FORMATION WHICH PROMPTED THE ANCIENTS TO SAY THEY'D BONED UP ON GEOMETRY AND MILITARY STRATEGY
FROM THE FISH BRANCH THERE WERE MANTA RAYS ENORMOUS CARTILAGINOUS FISH TEN FEET LONG AND WEIGHING 600 POUNDS THEIR PECTORAL FIN TRIANGULAR THEIR MIDBACK SLIGHTLY ARCHED THEIR EYES ATTACHED TO THE EDGES OF THE FACE AT THE FRONT OF THE HEAD
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO OH HE EXCLAIMED IF ONLY MY NAUTILUS WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO STAND THAT MUCH PRESSURE WITHOUT BEING CRUSHED WELL I ASKED NOT CATCHING THE CAPTAIN'S MEANING
THIS INCIDENT DID NOT INTERRUPT OUR WALK
NOTHING SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED ON BOARD
IT SEEMED AS IF THESE VISCOUS TENTACLES GREW BACK LIKE THE MANY HEADS OF HYDRA
NOBODY ATE NOBODY SLEPT
ITS GLOBULAR SHAPE PERFECT CLARITY AND WONDERFUL ORIENT MADE IT A JEWEL OF INCALCULABLE VALUE
IT WAS AN INSANE IDEA
WELL PUT THE CANADIAN REPLIED
LIKE THE MOON WHICH LONG AGO LOST ITS VITAL HEAT OUR GLOBE WILL BECOME LIFELESS AND UNLIVABLE IN HOW MANY CENTURIES CONSEIL ASKED
I WAS UNWILLING TO GET INTO A POINTLESS ARGUMENT WITH THE CANADIAN AND DIDN'T REPLY
THAT FLAT COASTLINE CURVING SOUTHWARD IS THE COAST OF EGYPT TELL IT TO THE MARINES SIR ANSWERED THE STUBBORN CANADIAN
THIS FOREST WAS MADE UP OF BIG TREELIKE PLANTS AND WHEN WE ENTERED BENEATH THEIR HUGE ARCHES MY EYES WERE INSTANTLY STRUCK BY THE UNIQUE ARRANGEMENT OF THEIR BRANCHES--AN ARRANGEMENT THAT I HAD NEVER BEFORE ENCOUNTERED
OVER THE ENSUING DAYS AND WEEKS CAPTAIN NEMO WAS VERY FRUGAL WITH HIS VISITS
I LOOKED TO PORT AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE IMMENSENESS OF THESE TRANQUIL WATERS
AND FOR CERTAIN IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT'S CHARACTERISTIC STUBBORNNESS THE FRIGATE WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE PUT BACK TO THAT CAPE IN THE SOUTH
IT'S ONE OF THE MANY ISLETS WITH WHICH THIS SEA IS STREWN
THIS PROMISE WAS GIVEN ON NOVEMBER 2
THE PLAINS OF SAND WERE FOLLOWED BY A BED OF THAT VISCOUS SLIME AMERICANS CALL OOZE WHICH IS COMPOSED EXCLUSIVELY OF SEASHELLS RICH IN LIMESTONE OR SILICA
AS FOR THE SAVAGES THEY WENT BACK TO SHORE NEAR ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN THE HEADS OF CORAL BEGAN TO DISAPPEAR UNDER THE WAVES OF THE RISING TIDE
THEN HE TOLD ME
THEN HE TOLD ME
AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS 1872 AND MICHAEL STROGOFF 1876 ARE CLOSER TO TRAVELOGS ADVENTURE YARNS IN FAR-AWAY PLACES
SEA TANGLE AND KELP FROM THE GENUS MACROCYSTIS SATURATED WITH THE MUCILAGE THEIR PORES PERSPIRE FROM WHICH I SELECTED A WONDERFUL NEMASTOMA GELINIAROIDEA CLASSIFYING IT WITH THE NATURAL CURIOSITIES IN THE MUSEUM
THE AFORESAID STATEROOM 5 METERS LONG
THESE WERE MANATEES WHICH BELONG TO THE ORDER SIRENIA LIKE THE DUGONG AND STELLER'S SEA COW
NEAR TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE CORE OF LIGHT REAPPEARED NO LESS INTENSE FIVE MILES TO WINDWARD OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
WHAT'S MORE THE FORMATION OF COAL IN OTHER WORDS THE PETRIFICATION OF FORESTS SWALLOWED BY FLOODS AND THE COOLING OF BASALTIC ROCKS LIKEWISE CALL FOR A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME
THE FIRST WAY HE WENT ON IS DEATH BY CRUSHING
ITS VOLCANIC ORIGIN WAS UNMISTAKABLE
THE TRAILS WERE CLUTTERED WITH ALGAE AND FUCUS PLANTS HOSTS OF CRUSTACEANS SWARMING AMONG THEM
DAYLIGHT APPEARED
YES A THICKET OF DEAD TREES
OUR DRAGNET WAS FILLED WITH MIDAS ABALONE HARP SHELLS OBELISK SNAILS AND ESPECIALLY THE FINEST HAMMER SHELLS I HAD SEEN TO THAT DAY
THAT COMES I TOLD HIM FROM THE WATER TEMPERATURE OF THE GULF STREAM WHICH AS IT LEAVES THE GULF OF MEXICO IS BARELY DIFFERENT FROM YOUR BLOOD TEMPERATURE
HE KNEW THIS DARK PATH
ENOUGH OF THESE FAIRY TALES THAT TIME HAS CHANGED FOR ME INTO HARSH REALITIES
A STREAM OF WAVES BEARING FROM SOUTHEAST TO NORTHWEST AT A SPEED OF TWO AND A HALF MILES PER HOUR BROKE OVER HEADS OF CORAL EMERGING HERE AND THERE
THE SITE'S EXACT BEARINGS WERE TAKEN AND THE MORAVIAN CONTINUED ON COURSE APPARENTLY UNDAMAGED
LET'S STAY TOGETHER UNTIL WE'RE OUT OF THIS BLIND ALLEY AS MASTER WISHES CONSEIL REPLIED
THE ENORMOUS VESSEL SETTLED SLOWLY
ANOTHER CABLE WAS PUT DOWN UNDER BETTER CONDITIONS
CONSEIL I SHOUTED
BIRDS OF PARADISE I EXCLAIMED
THIS CAPE FORMS THE TIP OF ARABIA PETRAEA WHICH LIES BETWEEN THE GULF OF SUEZ AND THE GULF OF AQABA
BUT NO
BUT NO
EVEN SO THESE ATLANTIC FISH WERE NOT NOTICEABLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WE HAD OBSERVED EARLIER
HIS BODY LEANING SLIGHTLY BACK NED LAND BRANDISHED HIS HARPOON WITH EXPERT HANDS
THE WATER WAS FRESH AND CLEAR BUT IT WAS STILL WATER--WHICH WASN'T WHAT NED LAND HAD IN MIND
IN MIDOCEAN IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO ENCOUNTER WHALES SO SOUND ASLEEP THEY CAN SUCCESSFULLY BE ATTACKED AND NED LAND HAD HARPOONED MORE THAN ONE IN ITS SLUMBER
MY MOVEMENTS WERE QUITE FREE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE EXECUTED UNDER A PRESSURE OF THIRTY ATMOSPHERES
I HADN'T SEEN HIM FOR A GOOD WHILE
PERHAPS THEY WOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS NEARLY UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
WE'VE GOT TO GET THERE FIRST THAT'S ALL GET THERE FIRST
BUT HERE IT WAS JUST AS IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN BACK AS TO GO FORWARD BECAUSE EVERY PASSAGEWAY HAD CLOSED BEHIND US AND IF OUR SUBMERSIBLE REMAINED EVEN SLIGHTLY STATIONARY IT WOULD BE FROZEN IN WITHOUT DELAY
NOT EVEN SUNSHINE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR OUR PURPOSES
I KNOW FULL WELL WHAT HAPPENED
I DOVE INTO STUDYING THE CONCHOLOGICAL TREASURES AMASSED INSIDE THE GLASS CASES
YOU WON'T ESCAPE THE NAUTILUS'S SPUR
AT NOON THE NEXT DAY NOVEMBER 5 THE AGREED-UPON DELAY EXPIRED
I FELT MYSELF BEING DRAWN INTO THAT STRANGE DOMAIN WHERE THE OVERWROUGHT IMAGINATION OF EDGAR ALLAN POE WAS AT HOME
WE WON'T BE GOING VERY DEEP AND THE SUN'S RAYS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO LIGHT OUR WAY
AS FOR ME I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM
CONSEIL WHOM I HADN'T ALERTED MISTOOK IT AT FIRST FOR A GIGANTIC SEA SNAKE AND WAS GEARING UP TO CLASSIFY IT IN HIS BEST MANNER
IN 1,000 GRAMS ONE FINDS 96.5 WATER AND ABOUT 2.66 SODIUM CHLORIDE
THESE WERE PETRELS CAPE PIGEONS OR PUFFINS AND THEIR CALLS WERE DEAFENING
NOW THEN THAT EVENING IT BECAME OBVIOUS MUCH TO MY SATISFACTION THAT WE WERE RETURNING NORTH BY THE ATLANTIC ROUTE
THE WEATHER WAS FAIR THE SKIES REASONABLY CLEAR THE COLD QUITE BRISK NAMELY 12 DEGREES CENTIGRADE
THERE WERE MANY ENGLISH AND FRENCH STEAMERS PLOWING THIS NARROW PASSAGEWAY LINERS GOING FROM SUEZ TO BOMBAY CALCUTTA MELBOURNE RéUNION ISLAND AND MAURITIUS
LOOK AT THESE MAGNIFICENT ROCKS THESE UNINHABITED CAVES THESE LAST GLOBAL HAUNTS WHERE LIFE IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE
CAPTAIN NEMO LED ME TO THE NAUTILUS'S STERN AND INVITED ME INTO A CABIN LOCATED NEXT TO THE SAILORS QUARTERS
THEY WERE LIKE SUITS OF ARMOR THAT WERE BOTH YIELDING AND RESISTANT YOU MIGHT SAY
WE'LL ESCAPE NO MATTER WHAT THE WEATHER BUT THE SKIES BECAME MORE AND MORE THREATENING
BUT THAT WASN'T THE END OF THE STORY
SOON SCARCELY BLURRED BY THEIR DISTANCE FROM US THE FORMS OF SOME OBJECTS TOOK SHAPE BEFORE MY EYES
I WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO CLEAR CAPTAIN NEMO'S TUNNEL COULDN'T SIT STILL AND WANTED TO BREATHE THE FRESH NIGHT AIR
BY KEEPING YOU ON BOARD IT ISN'T YOU WHOM I CARE FOR IT'S ME THESE WORDS INDICATED THAT THE COMMANDER PURSUED A POLICY IMPERVIOUS TO ARGUMENTS
YET DEEP DOWN I HAD ACCEPTED THE EXISTENCE OF THE MONSTER MY ARTICLE WAS HOTLY DEBATED CAUSING A FINE OLD UPROAR
IT NEEDED TO SINK TO FIFTY METERS SEARCHING FOR A RESTING PLACE IN THE BOWELS OF THE SEA
THE HATCH WAS OPEN
ENGLISH WHALERS HAVE GIVEN THIS THE NAME ICE BLINK NO MATTER HOW HEAVY THE CLOUDS MAY BE THEY CAN'T OBSCURE THIS PHENOMENON
THE STATEROOM WAS DESERTED
HE WAS ITS VERY SOUL
THE RUHMKORFF LAMP HANGING FROM MY BELT MY RIFLE IN HAND I WAS READY TO GO FORTH
AND IN ORDER TO COMPLETE HIS STUDY OF MARINE ARTICULATES HE NEEDED TO MENTION THE CLASS CIRRIPEDIA WHICH CONTAINS WATER FLEAS AND CARP LICE PLUS THE CLASS ANNELIDA WHICH HE WOULD HAVE DIVIDED WITHOUT FAIL INTO TUBIFEX WORMS AND DORSIBRANCHIAN WORMS
I WANTED TO OFFER YOU THE UNUSUAL SIGHT OF AN UNDERWATER ERUPTION I THOUGHT I SAID THAT THE FORMATION OF SUCH NEW ISLANDS HAD COME TO AN END NOTHING EVER COMES TO AN END IN THESE VOLCANIC WATERWAYS CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED AND THANKS TO ITS UNDERGROUND FIRES OUR GLOBE IS CONTINUOUSLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN THESE REGIONS
THIS MEASURE WAS DISTASTEFUL TO ME
ITS COLDNESS RAN THROUGH ME
BY 8:30 WE WERE SUITED UP FOR THIS NEW STROLL AND EQUIPPED WITH OUR TWO DEVICES FOR LIGHTING AND BREATHING
THE MORNING MISTS SURROUNDED US BUT THEY SOON BROKE UP
WILL MASTER THE GALLANT LAD SAID TO ME ALLOW ME TO WISH HIM A HAPPY NEW YEAR GOOD HEAVENS CONSEIL IT'S JUST LIKE OLD TIMES IN MY OFFICE AT THE BOTANICAL GARDENS IN PARIS
THE MUSEUM AT THE FACULTY OF MEDICINE IN PARIS OWNS ONE OF THESE TUSKS WITH A LENGTH OF 2.25 METERS AND A WIDTH AT ITS BASE OF FORTY-EIGHT CENTIMETERS
BUT FLEEING ACROSS THE NEW GUINEA TERRITORIES WOULD BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND I WOULDN'T HAVE ADVISED NED LAND TO TRY IT
NO DOUBT THEY WENT BENEATH THE ICE BANK TO FIND MORE FEASIBLE SEAS
I LOOKED TO SEE IF THEIR APPEARANCE MIGHT DRAW SOME OF THE NAUTILUS'S MEN ONTO THE PLATFORM
THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO DESCRIBE THE LONG-SKULLED SPERM WHALE WHOSE LENGTH SOMETIMES EXCEEDS TWENTY-FIVE METERS
FOR ITS PART THE NARWHALE MIMICKED THE FRIGATE SIMPLY RODE WITH THE WAVES AND SEEMED DETERMINED NOT TO FORSAKE THE FIELD OF BATTLE
THIS NEEDLE SHOWS ME THE ACTUAL SPEED OF MY SUBMERSIBLE
BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON THE PANELS REMAINED HERMETICALLY SEALED
ARRIVING AT THIS 300-FOOT DEPTH I STILL DETECTED THE SUN'S RAYS BUT JUST BARELY
WE CAN HOLD OUT A GOOD WHILE YET MY FRIENDS I SAID WE MUSTN'T DESPAIR
RED SALMON SEEMED TO MOW THE WAVES WITH THEIR SLICING PECTORALS
INSIDE THE SUN'S RAYS SEEMED TO DIMINISH BY DEGREES
A SHADOW CAST BY OUR CRAG HID US FROM HIS VIEW
MARINE CREATURES THAT LEGENDS HAVE TURNED INTO MERMAIDS HALF WOMAN HALF FISH
CLASS GASTROPODA FAMILY BUCCINOIDEA GENUS COWRY SPECIES CYPRAEA MADAGASCARIENSIS ETC
NED LAND TESTED THE SOIL WITH HIS FOOT AS IF HE WERE LAYING CLAIM TO IT
AND IN ALL HONESTY SHIPBOARD CONDITIONS BECAME LIFE-THREATENING
31 HOUSTON TEXAS 77055
HE DROPPED ANCHOR FIRST AT BOTANY BAY VISITED THE TONGA ISLANDS AND NEW CALEDONIA HEADED TOWARD THE SANTA CRUZ ISLANDS AND PUT IN AT NOMUKA ONE OF THE ISLANDS IN THE HA'APAI GROUP
WHEN I ARRIVED ON THE PLATFORM THAT MORNING I SAW THE ISLAND OF HAWAII TWO MILES TO LEEWARD THE LARGEST OF THE SEVEN ISLANDS MAKING UP THIS GROUP
ON JANUARY 13 ARRIVING IN THE TIMOR SEA CAPTAIN NEMO RAISED THE ISLAND OF THAT NAME AT LONGITUDE 122 DEGREES
OUR PRISON LIT UP ALL AT ONCE
SOMETIMES ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES SOMETIMES BENEATH THEM THE SHIP WANDERED FOR DAYS AMID THESE MISTS SO FEARED BY NAVIGATORS
WAS OUR PRESENCE ON BOARD PERHAPS A BURDEN TO HIM
IMAGINE THIS WEAPON TO BE TEN TIMES STRONGER AND THE ANIMAL TEN TIMES MORE POWERFUL LAUNCH IT AT A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES PER HOUR MULTIPLY ITS MASS TIMES ITS VELOCITY AND YOU GET JUST THE COLLISION WE NEED TO CAUSE THE SPECIFIED CATASTROPHE
A FEW SAILS WERE ON THE HORIZON NO DOUBT SHIPS GOING AS FAR AS CAPE SãO ROQUE TO FIND FAVORABLE WINDS FOR DOUBLING THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE
BECAUSE I SAID IF I CAN TRUST MY HUNCHES IF I TRULY UNDERSTAND THE CAPTAIN'S WAY OF LIFE HIS NAUTILUS ISN'T SIMPLY A SHIP
BUT THIRTY FEET BELOW SEA LEVEL THEIR DOMINION CEASES THEIR INFLUENCE FADES THEIR POWER VANISHES
FINALLY WE LOWERED OUR HANDS
I COULD EASILY HAVE PICKED OFF THIS ISLANDER HE STOOD AT SUCH CLOSE RANGE
THE ISLAND WAS SOON ON VIEW THROUGH THE DISSOLVING MISTS FIRST ITS BEACHES THEN ITS SUMMITS
FOR SIX MONTHS THE WAR SEESAWED
I WALKED UP AND DOWN HOPING TO CALM MY TROUBLED MIND WITH MOVEMENT
ALL IN ALL WE ENJOYED A HIGHLY SATISFACTORY STATE OF HEALTH
IN 1863 ENGINEERS BUILT A NEW CABLE THAT MEASURED 3,400 KILOMETERS WEIGHED 4,500 METRIC TONS AND WAS SHIPPED ABOARD THE GREAT EASTERN
ONLY I'LL ASK YOUR PERMISSION SIR TO ADDRESS A QUESTION TO YOU JUST ONE GO AHEAD SIR YOU SAID WE'D BE FREE ABOARD YOUR VESSEL COMPLETELY THEN I WOULD ASK WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS FREEDOM WHY THE FREEDOM TO COME GO SEE AND EVEN CLOSELY OBSERVE EVERYTHING HAPPENING HERE--EXCEPT UNDER CERTAIN RARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN SHORT THE FREEDOM WE OURSELVES ENJOY MY COMPANIONS AND I IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT WE DID NOT UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
PETRIFIED SHRUBS RAMBLED HERE AND THERE IN SPRAWLING ZIGZAGS
THE CAPTAIN UNDERSTOOD AND GAVE ME A SIGNAL TO FOLLOW HIM
THEN LUNCH OVER EACH OF US PROPPED HIMSELF IN A CORNER
AFTER THIS CATALOG IF SOME RECALCITRANT LISTENER CONFUSES THE ARGONAUT WHICH IS ACETABULIFEROUS IN OTHER WORDS A BEARER OF SUCTION TUBES WITH THE NAUTILUS WHICH IS TENTACULIFEROUS A BEARER OF TENTACLES IT WILL BE SIMPLY UNFORGIVABLE
ON THE OTHER HAND MASTER KNOWS HOW MUCH AIR EACH MAN CONSUMES IN THE ACT OF BREATHING AND HE CAN COMPARE THIS DATA WITH THE FACT THAT THE NAUTILUS MUST RISE TO THE SURFACE EVERY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS CONSEIL DIDN'T FINISH HIS SENTENCE BUT I COULD EASILY SEE WHAT HE WAS DRIVING AT
THANKS TO CERTAIN HEAVY MISTS WE COULDN'T SEE FROM ONE END OF THE PLATFORM TO THE OTHER
CAPTAIN NEMO ON FAMILIAR TERMS WITH THESE DREADFUL ANIMALS NO LONGER MINDED THEM
AS I SAW IT THE NAUTILUS WOULD ATTACK THE DOUBLE-DECKER ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES AND THEN IT WOULD BE NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT EASY TO ESCAPE
IT WAS INTERMITTENT
SOME FRESH VEGETABLES WOULD BE WELL RECEIVED IN THE NAUTILUS'S PANTRY MASTER IS RIGHT CONSEIL REPLIED AND I PROPOSE THAT WE SET ASIDE THREE PLACES IN OUR LONGBOAT
BUT IN MIDOCEAN IT WAS UNTHINKABLE
SO ALL HAIL TO MR DE LESSEPS YES ALL HAIL TO THAT GREAT FRENCH CITIZEN I REPLIED QUITE STARTLED BY HOW EMPHATICALLY CAPTAIN NEMO HAD JUST SPOKEN
HOWEVER I DIDN'T SEE ONE LOCAL DUGOUT CANOE
NO SOUNDINGS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REACH THEM
ARISTOTLE PUT THE DIMENSIONS OF ONE SQUID AT FIVE CUBITS OR 3.1 METERS
I IMAGINE THAT STEAMBOAT BELONGED TO THE PENINSULAR ORIENTAL LINE WHICH PROVIDES SERVICE FROM THE ISLAND OF CEYLON TO SIDNEY ALSO CALLING AT KING GEORGE SOUND AND MELBOURNE
EXCEPT FOR THAT GRUELING ORDEAL UNDER THE ICE BANK AT THE SOUTH POLE WE HAD NEVER FELT BETTER NEITHER NED CONSEIL NOR I
I SAMPLED IT AND AGREED
AS FOR CAPTAIN NEMO I WONDERED WHAT HE WOULD MAKE OF OUR ESCAPING WHAT CONCERN OR PERHAPS WHAT DISTRESS IT MIGHT CAUSE HIM AND WHAT HE WOULD DO IN THE TWOFOLD EVENT OF OUR ATTEMPT EITHER FAILING OR BEING FOUND OUT
IF WE CAN TRUST TRADITION IT WAS PROBABLY EGYPT'S KING SESOSTRIS WHO STARTED DIGGING THE CANAL NEEDED TO JOIN THE NILE WITH THE RED SEA
IT ISN'T JUST FOR MYSELF THAT I RAISE THIS ISSUE
HE WAS THE FRENCHMAN'S CAPTAIN COOK
IT WAS THE BULLHEAD OF THE NORTHERLY SEAS A FISH WITH RED FINS AND A BROWN BODY COVERED WITH NODULES
I THOUGHT THE NAUTILUS WAS ABOUT TO RESUME ITS UNDERWATER NAVIGATING
WHY I'LL NO LONGER BE SAFE NEXT TO YOU I WHO SHARE YOUR CABIN
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY SHRINKING BUT WHAT A BARRIER STILL LAY BETWEEN US AND THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
INSTEAD OF DIGGING ALL AROUND THE NAUTILUS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENTAILED EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTIES CAPTAIN NEMO HAD AN IMMENSE TRENCH OUTLINED ON THE ICE EIGHT METERS FROM OUR PORT QUARTER
AND YET IN THE MIDST OF THIS TURMOIL THE NAUTILUS LIVED UP TO THAT SAYING OF AN EXPERT ENGINEER
BUT I DIDN'T SUFFER VERY MUCH ALTHOUGH CAPTAIN NEMO HADN'T YET MADE DEMANDS ON THE SUPPLEMENTARY OXYGEN IN HIS AIR TANKS
HE'S TIRED OF STARING AT FISH AND EATING THEM DAY IN AND DAY OUT
AT ANY INSTANT A COLLISION COULD HAVE OCCURRED THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FATAL TO US
NED AS USUAL KEPT LOOKING FOR CHANGES OF PACE FROM OUR STANDARD FARE
THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN HAD BEEN PERFECTLY CHOSEN AND FITTED OUT FOR ITS NEW ASSIGNMENT
SMALL MUSSELS LIMPETS SMOOTH HEART-SHAPED COCKLES AND ESPECIALLY SOME SEA BUTTERFLIES WITH OBLONG MEMBRANE-FILLED BODIES WHOSE HEADS ARE FORMED FROM TWO ROUNDED LOBES
DURING OUR CROSSING I SAW NUMEROUS BALEEN WHALES BELONGING TO THE THREE SPECIES UNIQUE TO THESE SOUTHERNMOST SEAS
KEEPING A SECRET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE DIFFICULT ENOUGH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND CERTAINLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR A NATION WHOSE EVERY MOVE IS UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE BY RIVAL POWERS
BUT SOON THESE LAST REPRESENTATIVES OF ANIMAL LIFE VANISHED AND THREE VERTICAL LEAGUES DOWN THE NAUTILUS PASSED BELOW THE LIMITS OF UNDERWATER EXISTENCE JUST AS AN AIR BALLOON RISES ABOVE THE BREATHABLE ZONES IN THE SKY
MINE 2.5 METERS LONG
I MIGHT ADD THAT THOSE DAYS IN THE BIBLE MUST REPRESENT WHOLE EPOCHS AND NOT LITERALLY THE LAPSE OF TIME BETWEEN TWO SUNRISES BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE ITSELF THE SUN DOESN'T DATE FROM THE FIRST DAY OF CREATION WHEN THE NAUTILUS RETURNED TO THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN I COULD TAKE IN REAO ISLAND OVER ITS WHOLE FLAT WOODED EXPANSE
BLOOD WAS POURING INTO THE WAVES FROM ITS WOUNDS
I FELT INVOLUNTARILY REASSURED IN HIS PRESENCE AND THIS BODED WELL FOR OUR INTERVIEW
JUST REMEMBER ONE THING
THEN HE SAID
I COULDN'T PASS UP THIS CHANCE FOR AN ENCOUNTER
IT WAS SUCH WAVES IN THE HEBRIDES THAT REPOSITIONED A STONE BLOCK WEIGHING 84,000 POUNDS
SO THE FRIGATE WAS EQUIPPED FOR A FAR-OFF VOYAGE AND ARMED WITH FEARSOME FISHING GEAR BUT NOBODY KNEW WHERE TO STEER IT
DURING THE MAGNIFICENT EVENING OF JUNE 25--IN OTHER WORDS THREE WEEKS AFTER OUR DEPARTURE--THE FRIGATE LAY ABREAST OF CABO BLANCO THIRTY MILES TO LEEWARD OF THE COAST OF PATAGONIA
YOUR NEMO'S VEERING AWAY FROM SHORE AND HEADING UP NORTH
JUST THEN A HOLLOW EXPLOSION WAS AUDIBLE
NOT EVEN A 24-HOUR BREATHER WAS GRANTED TO COMMANDER FARRAGUT
WELL NED THE FATES WERE AGAINST US YESTERDAY YES
A SQUALL WAS ON THE WAY
EIGHT MILES TO THE EAST A BIG STEAMSHIP WAS VISIBLE ON THE HORIZON LINE
IN FACT I HAD ALREADY RESORTED TO SPEEDING UP MY INHALATIONS IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM THE CELL WHAT LITTLE OXYGEN IT CONTAINED WHEN SUDDENLY I WAS REFRESHED BY A CURRENT OF CLEAN AIR SCENTED WITH A SALTY AROMA
MAGNIFICENT STURGEONS NINE TO TEN METERS LONG AND EXTREMELY FAST BANGED THEIR POWERFUL TAILS AGAINST THE GLASS OF OUR PANELS SHOWING BLUISH BACKS WITH SMALL BROWN SPOTS
I HAD THIS LAND RIGHT UNDER MY EYES FURNISHING ITS OWN UNIMPEACHABLE EVIDENCE OF THE CATASTROPHE THAT HAD OVERTAKEN IT
WELL CONSEIL MY FRIEND ON BEHALF OF THE RAYS I WOULDN'T ADVISE YOU TO PUT THEM IN THE SAME FISH TANK TERTIO CONSEIL REPLIED THE STURIONIANS WHOSE GILL OPENING IS THE USUAL SINGLE SLIT ADORNED WITH A GILL COVER AN ORDER CONSISTING OF FOUR GENERA
MASSES OF OVERHANGING ROCK HAD TO BE GOTTEN AROUND
THE SKIFF ADVANCED TOWARD MANNAR ISLAND WHICH CURVED TO THE SOUTH
THEY FORM IN ISOLATION WITHIN THE MOLLUSK'S TISSUE
IT NOTICEABLY TAKES THE SHAPE OF A CIGAR A SHAPE ALREADY ADOPTED IN LONDON FOR SEVERAL PROJECTS OF THE SAME KIND
THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL CONSEIL THEN SAID
SHOWER YOUR FUTILE SHELLS
THE LOUNGE WAS DARK BUT THE SEA'S WAVES SPARKLED THROUGH THE TRANSPARENT WINDOWS
YOU'RE MY PRISONERS OF WAR
AT 11:45 THE SUN BY THEN SEEN ONLY BY REFRACTION LOOKED LIKE A GOLDEN DISK DISPERSING ITS LAST RAYS OVER THIS DESERTED CONTINENT AND DOWN TO THESE SEAS NOT YET PLOWED BY THE SHIPS OF MAN
ICE FIELDS OR SMOOTH LIMITLESS TRACTS
IMAGINE THE IMPACT OF SUCH A MASS IF IT WERE LAUNCHED AT FULL SPEED IS IT TRUE CONSEIL ASKED THAT THEY CAN SINK SHIPS SHIPS
THE NAUTILUS BEGAN TO SINK ON A VERTICAL LINE BECAUSE ITS PROPELLER WAS IN CHECK AND NO LONGER FURNISHED ANY FORWARD MOTION
WITH THAT MINOR ADDITION CONSEIL REPLIED THESE FOWL WOULD MAKE PERFECT LAMPS
THE FRIGATE'S INTERIOR ACCOMMODATIONS COMPLEMENTED ITS NAUTICAL VIRTUES
OBVIOUSLY IT WAS SOME HARD IMPENETRABLE SUBSTANCE NOT THE SOFT MATTER THAT MAKES UP THE BODIES OF OUR BIG MARINE MAMMALS
CONSTANTLY TOSSED ABOUT BY HURRICANES THE ZEALOUS AND THE NEW ASTROLABE COULDN'T COMPARE WITH THE NAUTILUS A QUIET WORK ROOM TRULY AT REST IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS EVEN SO CAPTAIN I SAID THERE IS ONE MAJOR SIMILARITY BETWEEN DUMONT D'URVILLE'S SLOOPS OF WAR AND THE NAUTILUS WHAT'S THAT SIR LIKE THEM THE NAUTILUS HAS RUN AGROUND THE NAUTILUS IS NOT AGROUND SIR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED ICILY
HE SEEMED TO BE AVOIDING ME
NO MORE THAN THE COLLISIONS IT CAUSED
THE NAUTILUS WASN'T GOING TO STRIKE THE DOUBLE-DECKER WHERE IT WAS CLAD IN IMPENETRABLE IRON ARMOR BUT BELOW ITS WATERLINE WHERE THE METAL CARAPACE NO LONGER PROTECTED ITS PLANKING
STAY ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY BUT DON'T FORGET ONE SLIPUP WILL FINISH US I WON'T FORGET SIR AND NOW NED WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MY OVERALL THINKING ON YOUR PLAN GLADLY PROFESSOR ARONNAX WELL THEN I THINK--AND I DON'T MEAN I HOPE'--THAT YOUR PROMISING OPPORTUNITY WON'T EVER ARISE WHY NOT BECAUSE CAPTAIN NEMO RECOGNIZES THAT WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF RECOVERING OUR FREEDOM AND HE'LL KEEP ON HIS GUARD ABOVE ALL IN SEAS WITHIN SIGHT OF THE COASTS OF EUROPE I'M OF MASTER'S OPINION CONSEIL SAID
FIRE AND BRIMSTONE IT'S HAILING CONSEIL SAID
DISAPPEAR O RADIANT ORB
DESPITE MY REVULSION I FORCED IT DOWN WANTING TO KEEP MY STRENGTH UP
SOON THE NAUTILUS REENTERED ITS LIQUID ELEMENT AND THE PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED THAT IT WAS STAYING AT A DEPTH OF THIRTY FEET
SHATTERED AT THE END OF MY STRENGTH I SLID FLAT ON MY BELLY TO THE HATCH
THE HOPE AND THE SEARCH PASSED RIGHT BY VANIKORO WITHOUT STOPPING THERE
WHERE WERE WE HEADING NOW AND WHAT DID THE FUTURE HAVE IN STORE FOR US
THE NAUTILUS STILL EMERGED ABOVE THE SURFACE
ACCORDINGLY THREE YEARS AGO AT THE MOST CAPTAIN NEMO HAD BEGUN HIS UNDERWATER EXISTENCE
I REJOINED NED LAND AND CONSEIL
AFTER A STRETCH OF SOME TEN METERS A SECOND DOOR OPENED BEFORE ME
A SHOT WENT OFF I HEARD A FAINT HISSING AND AN ANIMAL DROPPED A FEW PACES AWAY LITERALLY STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
MADREPORES WHICH ONE MUST GUARD AGAINST CONFUSING WITH PRECIOUS CORAL CLOTHE THEIR TISSUE IN A LIMESTONE CRUST AND THEIR VARIATIONS IN STRUCTURE HAVE LED MY FAMOUS MENTOR PROFESSOR MILNE-EDWARDS TO CLASSIFY THEM INTO FIVE DIVISIONS
CAPE RACE ST PAUL ISLAND THE STRAIT OF BELLE ISLE THE ST LAWRENCE ESTUARY
THERE THE KATRIN FERRY TRANSFERRED MEN HORSES AND CARRIAGE TO BROOKLYN THAT GREAT NEW YORK ANNEX LOCATED ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE EAST RIVER AND IN A FEW MINUTES WE ARRIVED AT THE WHARF NEXT TO WHICH THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS VOMITING TORRENTS OF BLACK SMOKE FROM ITS TWO FUNNELS
THAT'S MY EMPLOYER'S BAILIWICK AND IN TRUTH ALTHOUGH THE FINE LAD WAS A CLASSIFYING MANIAC HE WAS NO NATURALIST AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A BONITO FROM A TUNA
WE'LL ESCAPE TONIGHT EVEN IF THE SEA SWALLOWS US UP THE SEA'S ROUGH THE WIND'S BLOWING HARD BUT A TWENTY-MILE RUN IN THE NAUTILUS'S NIMBLE LONGBOAT DOESN'T SCARE ME
AND FINALLY FOR NATURALISTS IT'S A SIMPLE FESTERING SECRETION FROM THE ORGAN THAT PRODUCES MOTHER-OF-PEARL IN CERTAIN BIVALVES BRANCH MOLLUSCA CONSEIL SAID CLASS ACEPHALA ORDER TESTACEA CORRECT MY SCHOLARLY CONSEIL
ALL AT ONCE A YELL FROM CONSEIL MADE ME TURN AROUND
A LOST CONTINENT 199 10
BUT MOST OF THEM WERE OUTDISTANCED BY OUR SPEED AND SOON FELL BEHIND
WHILE WE WERE WALKING I THOUGHT THE LIGHTS OF OUR RUHMKORFF DEVICES WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ATTRACT SOME INHABITANTS OF THESE DARK STRATA
CONTRIVED AT THE REAR OF THE DINING ROOM A DOUBLE DOOR OPENED AND I ENTERED A ROOM WHOSE DIMENSIONS EQUALED THE ONE I HAD JUST LEFT
IT WAS AN OLD-FASHIONED BATTERING RAM PROPELLED WITH INFINITE POWER
WE WERE DUTY BOUND TO FEAR SO RATHER THAN HOPE SO
FOR SEVERAL HOURS I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF SOMETIMES MUSING ON THE ISLANDERS BUT NO LONGER FEARING THEM BECAUSE THE CAPTAIN'S UNFLAPPABLE CONFIDENCE HAD WON ME OVER--AND SOMETIMES FORGETTING THEM TO MARVEL AT THE SPLENDORS OF THIS TROPICAL NIGHT
BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENS JUST WHEN A DECISION HAD BEEN MADE TO CHASE THE MONSTER THE MONSTER PUT IN NO FURTHER APPEARANCES
CONSEQUENTLY IT COST 1,687,000 FRANCS HENCE 2,000,000 FRANCS INCLUDING ITS ACCOMMODATIONS AND 4,000,000 OR 5,000,000 WITH ALL THE COLLECTIONS AND WORKS OF ART IT CONTAINS ONE LAST QUESTION CAPTAIN NEMO ASK PROFESSOR YOU'RE RICH THEN INFINITELY RICH SIR AND WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE I COULD PAY OFF THE TEN-BILLION-FRANC FRENCH NATIONAL DEBT I GAPED AT THE BIZARRE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD JUST SPOKEN THESE WORDS
PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE ASKED ME DO YOU KNOW THE DEPTH OF THE OCEAN FLOOR AT LEAST CAPTAIN I KNOW WHAT THE MAJOR SOUNDINGS TELL US COULD YOU QUOTE THEM TO ME SO I CAN DOUBLE-CHECK THEM AS THE NEED ARISES HERE I REPLIED ARE A FEW OF THEM THAT STICK IN MY MEMORY
TO OPERATE WITH SUCH EFFICIENCY THIS UNDERWATER BOAT HAD TO HAVE A SIZEABLE CREW SO IF IT CAME TO A PHYSICAL CONTEST WE WOULD BE FACING AN OVERWHELMING OPPONENT
WOULD COMMANDER FARRAGUT PUT A LONGBOAT TO SEA
SO I'LL ASK YOU FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL VIEWS HERE THEY COME
AN INTENSE MUSKY ODOR FILLED THE AIR
I'D NOTED THAT IN THE RED SEA AND THE MEDITERRANEAN THERE EXIST A NUMBER OF ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL SPECIES OF FISH
AROUND THIS BASIN INSIDE ELEGANT GLASS CASES FASTENED WITH COPPER BANDS THERE WERE CLASSIFIED AND LABELED THE MOST VALUABLE MARINE EXHIBITS EVER PUT BEFORE THE EYES OF A NATURALIST
THEN THE PIGEON AND RINGDOVE WERE DEVOURED TO THE BONES AND DECLARED EXCELLENT
OH SIR HE TOLD ME IN A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT I'VE NEVER KILLED ANYTHING LIKE THAT HIS WHOLE BEING WAS CONCENTRATED IN THIS LAST WORD
WHICH WOULD BE AN AFFRONT TO CAPTAIN NEMO SINCE HE HATES TO SLAY HARMLESS BEASTS NEEDLESSLY HE'S RIGHT CERTAINLY CONSEIL
I LISTENED FOR FOOTSTEPS IN THE STATEROOM ADJOINING MINE
NOTHING GOOD BECAUSE AT FIRST THEY KEPT IT AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE
WITH ITS TAIL CUT OFF IT WOULD HAVE FORMED A PERFECT DISK
I KEPT ON WORKING BUT THE TEMPERATURE ROSE TO THE POINT OF BECOMING UNBEARABLE
I FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE AND WITHOUT ANOTHER THOUGHT OF EXHAUSTION FRIENDS OR COLLECTIONS I ACCEPTED THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT'S OFFER
CONSEQUENTLY THE NAUTILUS HAD TO MANEUVER WITH CAUTION SO AS NOT TO BUMP INTO THIS UNDERWATER BARRIER
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
I SPOTTED THE FRIGATE
THE NAUTILUS'S FISHERMEN HAD SOME TROUBLE GETTING A GRIP ON THIS ANIMAL WHICH THANKS TO THE FORMATION OF ITS GILL COVERS CAN PROTECT ITS RESPIRATORY ORGANS FROM ANY PARCHING CONTACT WITH THE AIR AND CAN LIVE OUT OF WATER FOR A GOOD WHILE
CAPTAIN NEMO POINTED TO THIS PRODIGIOUS HEAP OF SHELLFISH AND I SAW THAT THESE MINES WERE GENUINELY INEXHAUSTIBLE SINCE NATURE'S CREATIVE POWERS ARE GREATER THAN MAN'S DESTRUCTIVE INSTINCTS
ARRIVING ON THE SEAFLOOR AT A DEPTH OF ABOUT FIVE METERS HE FELL TO HIS KNEES AND STUFFED HIS SACK WITH SHELLFISH GATHERED AT RANDOM
IF I WERE TO PART COMPANY WITH YOU I'D HAVE NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN EVER SEEING YOU AGAIN
SOMETIMES THESE SUCKERS FASTENED ONTO THE LOUNGE WINDOW BY CREATING VACUUMS AGAINST IT
IT WAS AN OLD HAND AT THE PACIFIC THE ENGLISH ADVENTURER CAPTAIN PETER DILLON WHO WAS THE FIRST TO PICK UP THE TRAIL LEFT BY CASTAWAYS FROM THE WRECKED VESSELS
SO LET'S CONTINUE OUR EXCURSION I WENT ON BUT KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT
UNSHAKEN BY THESE SQUALLS CAPTAIN NEMO STATIONED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM
AND THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S STEMPOST HADN'T EVEN CUT THE SUSPECTED WATERS OF THE PACIFIC
A SIMPLE TRIP TO AN OYSTERBANK ASSUREDLY CAPTAIN NEMO HADN'T SEEN FIT TO PLANT THE IDEA OF SHARKS IN THE MINDS OF MY COMPANIONS
GET MY THINGS READY GET YOURS READY
YOU SET FOOT ON ONE OF THE SHORES OF THIS GLOBE PROFESSOR AND YOU'RE SURPRISED TO FIND SAVAGES THERE
OH PROFESSOR SHOUTED NED LAND WHOSE HUNTING FEVER HAD GONE TO HIS BRAIN
I STARED IN SILENCE AT THE HIGH SHEER WALL WE WERE SKIRTING JUST THEN THE FIRM BASE OF THE SANDY MOUNTAINS ON THE COAST
BUT TO OVERCOME ALL THE OBSTACLES AROUND THE SOUTH POLE--EVEN MORE UNATTAINABLE THAN THE NORTH POLE WHICH STILL HADN'T BEEN REACHED BY THE BOLDEST NAVIGATORS WASN'T THIS AN ABSOLUTELY INSANE UNDERTAKING ONE THAT COULD OCCUR ONLY IN THE BRAIN OF A MADMAN
WE WENT SWIFTLY DOWN THE MOUNTAIN
IT MARKED A DEPTH OF SIXTY FEET A DEPTH BEYOND THE REACH OF ATMOSPHERIC HEAT
AND SO IT WENT SOME NEW WONDER CONSTANTLY DELIGHTING US
IN PLACE BY THE OARS CONSEIL AND I ROWED VIGOROUSLY AND NED STEERED US INTO THE NARROW LANES BETWEEN THE BREAKERS
I SAW THIS MYSTIFYING INDIVIDUAL ANEW FOR WHAT HE INEVITABLY MUST BE
WE'VE GOT TO HOLD ON TIGHT NED SAID AND SCREW THE NUTS DOWN AGAIN
ENERGY SHOWN BY THE SWIFTLY KNITTING MUSCLES OF HIS BROW
CHAPTER 22 THE LIGHTNING BOLTS OF CAPTAIN NEMO WITHOUT STANDING UP WE STARED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FOREST MY HAND STOPPING HALFWAY TO MY MOUTH NED LAND'S COMPLETING ITS ASSIGNMENT
MAELSTROM
BUT EVEN SO THAT VOICE
BUT DINNER OR BREAKFAST THAT STEWARD WILL BE PLENTY WELCOME WHETHER HE BRINGS THE ONE OR THE OTHER THE ONE AND THE OTHER CONSEIL SAID
HIS EYE IS SHARP HIS ARM IS SURE
APPARENTLY A STOPCOCK INSIDE THE BOAT WAS LETTING IN WATER FROM OUTSIDE WHICH OVERRAN US AND SOON FILLED UP THE ROOM
IN THE FIRST GROUP
IT WAS ON THIS OCEANIC RIVER THAT THE NAUTILUS WAS THEN NAVIGATING
THE SOUTH POLE ISN'T AT THE WATER'S EDGE BUT FAR INLAND
I WANTED TO RUN TO THE CAPTAIN'S RESCUE
FOR HIS PART CONSEIL THOUGHT HE SPOTTED A TURTLE SIX FEET WIDE AND ADORNED WITH THREE PROTRUDING RIDGES THAT RAN LENGTHWISE
AND SURE ENOUGH THERE'S NOW TALK OF SUCH A DISCOVERY IN WHICH A NEW SET OF LEVERS GENERATES CONSIDERABLE POWER
AND SURE ENOUGH THERE'S NOW TALK OF SUCH A DISCOVERY IN WHICH A NEW SET OF LEVERS GENERATES CONSIDERABLE POWER
WHEN THEY WERE CAPTURED SOME HAWKSBILLS WERE STILL ASLEEP INSIDE THEIR CARAPACES A REFUGE FROM OTHER MARINE ANIMALS
IT WAS NOW THE 26TH
IN TWENTY-SIX YEARS CUNARD SHIPS HAVE MADE 2,000 ATLANTIC CROSSINGS WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A VOYAGE CANCELED A DELAY RECORDED A MAN A CRAFT OR EVEN A LETTER LOST
INVENTOR MUSICIAN RENAISSANCE GENIUS HE'S A TRAIL-BLAZING CREATION THE PROTOTYPE NOT ONLY FOR COUNTLESS RENEGADE SCIENTISTS IN POPULAR FICTION BUT EVEN FOR SUCH VARIED FIGURES AS SHERLOCK HOLMES OR WOLF LARSEN
A RUNAWAY REEF 1 2
CAPTAIN NEMO THEN BORED INTO THE LOWER SURFACE
I WANT IT SETTLED ONCE AND FOR ALL
THAT DAY IT WAS YULETIDE AND IT STRUCK ME THAT NED LAND BADLY MISSED CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS THAT GENUINE FAMILY HOLIDAY WHERE PROTESTANTS ARE SUCH ZEALOTS
THE NAUTILUS DID NOT STIR
THE NAUTILUS DID NOT STIR
IT'S ALMOST BEYOND CONJECTURE JULES VERNE 1828-1905 PUBLISHED THE FRENCH EQUIVALENTS OF THESE WORDS IN 1869 AND LITTLE HAS CHANGED SINCE
THE SEA CONTAINS IT
THE HUMPBACK WHALE FROM THE GENUS BALAENOPTERA IN OTHER WORDS WINGED WHALES BEASTS WITH WRINKLED BELLIES AND HUGE WHITISH FINS THAT GENUS NAME REGARDLESS DO NOT YET FORM WINGS
CARRIED AWAY BY HIS VIOLENT INSTINCTS NED LAND LEAPED UP THE COMPANIONWAY
THIS HEIGHT HAD TRIPLED SINCE THE MOMENT THE NAUTILUS HAD DIVED BENEATH THE WAVES
WIT HAD DEFEATED SCIENCE
SHEER CHANCE HAD PLACED US IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SQUID AND I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO METICULOUSLY STUDY SUCH A CEPHALOPOD SPECIMEN
WE CHASED IT UNFLAGGINGLY FOR A FULL HOUR AND I'D BEGUN TO THINK IT WOULD PROVE TOO DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE WHEN THE ANIMAL GOT THE UNTIMELY IDEA OF TAKING REVENGE ON US A NOTION IT WOULD SOON HAVE CAUSE TO REGRET
UNFORTUNATELY HE WENT ON I CAN'T TAKE YOU THROUGH THAT SUEZ CANAL BUT THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THE LONG JETTIES OF PORT SAID WHEN WE'RE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN I EXCLAIMED
THE OTHER WASHES THE SHORES OF IRELAND AND NORWAY WITH LUKEWARM WATER GOES BEYOND SPITZBERGEN WHERE ITS TEMPERATURE FALLS TO 4 DEGREES CENTIGRADE AND FASHIONS THE OPEN SEA AT THE POLE
THE MOUNTAINS OF ARGUMENTS AMASSED OVER A YEAR COLLAPSED ALL AT ONCE AND EACH MAN NOW WANTED ONLY TO CATCH UP ON HIS EATING AND SLEEPING TO MAKE UP FOR THE TIME HE HAD SO STUPIDLY SACRIFICED
HIS SWORN HATE FOR HUMANITY A HATE THAT PERHAPS WAS BENT ON SOME DREADFUL REVENGE--WHAT HAD PROVOKED IT
I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO THINK BUT NEXT TO ME I HEARD CAPTAIN NEMO'S VOICE SLOWLY SAY
THE NARWHALE SEEMED MOTIONLESS
THIS MAN WILL BE DEAD IN TWO HOURS NOTHING CAN SAVE HIM NOTHING CAPTAIN NEMO CLENCHED HIS FISTS AND TEARS SLID FROM HIS EYES WHICH I HAD THOUGHT INCAPABLE OF WEEPING
FORTUNATELY THIS COMPARTMENT DIDN'T CONTAIN THE BOILERS BECAUSE THEIR FURNACES WOULD HAVE BEEN ABRUPTLY EXTINGUISHED
IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE A MOCKERY OF THEM IT ISN'T AN ISSUE I SAID OF FISHING FOR THEM WITH A SWIVEL HOOK HOISTING THEM ONTO THE DECK OF A SHIP CHOPPING OFF THE TAIL WITH A SWEEP OF THE AX OPENING THE BELLY RIPPING OUT THE HEART AND TOSSING IT INTO THE SEA SO IT'S AN ISSUE OF YES PRECISELY IN THE WATER IN THE WATER YE GODS JUST GIVE ME A GOOD HARPOON
CALMNESS SINCE HIS SKIN PALE RATHER THAN RUDDY INDICATED TRANQUILITY OF BLOOD
MEANWHILE FEARING THAT DUMONT D'URVILLE WASN'T ABREAST OF DILLON'S ACTIVITIES THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SENT A SLOOP OF WAR TO VANIKORO THE BAYONNAISE UNDER COMMANDER LEGOARANT DE TROMELIN WHO HAD BEEN STATIONED ON THE AMERICAN WEST COAST
WE ARE NOT EVEN CONSTRAINED BY OUR WORD OF HONOR
STAYING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER IT ROLLED GENTLY SOMETIMES TO ONE SIDE SOMETIMES TO THE OTHER
THE HUNT IS ON
THESE WERE SUCKERFISH FROM THE THIRD FAMILY OF THE SUBBRACHIAN MALACOPTERYGIA
BUT ITS LINES ARE SUFFICIENTLY LONG AND THEIR TAPERING GRADUAL ENOUGH SO THAT THE DISPLACED WATER EASILY SLIPS PAST AND POSES NO OBSTACLE TO THE SHIP'S MOVEMENTS
HE TOLD ME
I COMMENTED ON THIS TO THE CAPTAIN
FIRST OFF I'LL MENTION THAT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA THERE EXIST VEINS OF ZINC IRON SILVER AND GOLD WHOSE MINING WOULD QUITE CERTAINLY BE FEASIBLE
LOOK SIR
WHEN I SHARED THESE IMPRESSIONS WITH HIM HE ANSWERED ME IN A TONE TOUCHED WITH EMOTION
FORTUNATELY THE GLASS CASES WERE SOLIDLY SECURED AT THE BASE AND HAD STOOD FAST
BUT A FEW DAYS LATER IT SNAPPED AGAIN AND COULDN'T BE RECOVERED FROM THE OCEAN DEPTHS
THEY LOOKED IN VAIN
CAREFULLY EXAMINING THIS MASS I COULD IDENTIFY THE SWOLLEN OUTLINES OF A SHIP SHORN OF ITS MASTS WHICH MUST HAVE SUNK BOW FIRST
BUT IN MY CASE SINCE I FACE CONSIDERABLE PRESSURES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA I NEEDED TO ENCLOSE MY HEAD IN A COPPER SPHERE LIKE THOSE FOUND ON STANDARD DIVING SUITS AND THE TWO HOSES FOR INHALATION AND EXHALATION NOW FEED TO THAT SPHERE THAT'S PERFECT CAPTAIN NEMO BUT THE AIR YOU CARRY MUST BE QUICKLY DEPLETED
HAVEN'T SEEN OR HEARD A THING THE CANADIAN REPLIED
I NO LONGER KNEW WHAT ARGUMENTS TO PUT FORWARD ON MY BEHALF
THE OUTSIDE DOOR HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN AND CAPTAIN NEMO CLOSED IT AFTER WE REENTERED THE FIRST CELL
AND FINALLY SPYGLASSES FOR BOTH DAY AND NIGHT ENABLING ME TO SCRUTINIZE EVERY POINT OF THE HORIZON ONCE THE NAUTILUS HAS RISEN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES THESE ARE THE NORMAL NAVIGATIONAL INSTRUMENTS I REPLIED AND I'M FAMILIAR WITH THEIR USES
THE ORDER WAS GIVEN TO STOP AND THE FRIGATE MERELY COASTED
BESIDES FOR SOME TIME NOW THE MAN HAD BEEN GLOOMIER MORE WITHDRAWN LESS SOCIABLE
IT CAN'T BE DENIED THAT SOME SPECIES OF SQUID AND OTHER DEVILFISH ARE QUITE LARGE THOUGH STILL SMALLER THAN CETACEANS
ALTHOUGH MY DIVING SUIT WAS HEAVY ENOUGH TO PROTECT ME FROM THIS ANIMAL'S BITES I COULDN'T KEEP BACK A SHUDDER OF HORROR
ALMOST EVERY DAY THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE WERE OPEN FOR SOME HOURS AND OUR EYES NEVER TIRED OF PROBING THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNDERWATER WORLD
IN THE CENTER STOOD AN UPRIGHT WHEEL GEARED TO RUDDER CABLES RUNNING TO THE NAUTILUS'S STERN
IT FILLED ME WITH REAL CHAGRIN TO CRUSH UNDERFOOT THE GLEAMING MOLLUSK SAMPLES THAT LITTERED THE SEAFLOOR BY THE THOUSANDS
OUR BEVERAGE CONSISTED OF CLEAR WATER TO WHICH FOLLOWING THE CAPTAIN'S EXAMPLE I ADDED SOME DROPS OF A FERMENTED LIQUOR EXTRACTED BY THE KAMCHATKA PROCESS FROM THE SEAWEED KNOWN BY NAME AS RHODYMENIA PALMATA
ABOVE US HUDDLED AMONG THE BROWN WEEDS THERE FLOATED OBJECTS ORIGINATING FROM ALL OVER
I ATTACH A PRINT OF THE POSITIVE
BUT ENGLISH AND AMERICAN WHALERS IN A FRENZY OF DESTRUCTION SLAUGHTERED ALL THE ADULTS INCLUDING PREGNANT FEMALES AND WHERE LIFE AND ACTIVITY ONCE EXISTED THOSE FISHERMEN LEFT BEHIND ONLY SILENCE AND DEATH
I WAS INCAPABLE OF CONNECTING TWO IDEAS IN LOGICAL ORDER AND I HAD STRAYED INTO THE MOST ABSURD HYPOTHESES WHEN I WAS SNAPPED OUT OF MY MENTAL STRUGGLES BY THESE WORDS FROM NED LAND
BARELY TWENTY FEET SEPARATED HIM FROM THE MOTIONLESS ANIMAL
MY COMPANIONS AND I THEN WITNESSED AN UNUSUAL SIGHT
CHAPTER 21 SOME DAYS ASHORE STEPPING ASHORE HAD AN EXHILARATING EFFECT ON ME
CAPTAIN NEMO NEVER TOOK HIS EYES OFF THE TWO CONCENTRIC CIRCLES OF THE COMPASS HANGING IN THE CABIN
ALL AT ONCE CARRIED AWAY BY ITS FRIGHTFUL EXCESS LOAD THE NAUTILUS SANK INTO THE WATERS LIKE A CANNONBALL IN OTHER WORDS DROPPING AS IF IN A VACUUM
FISH FLED HERE AND THERE AS THEIR RETREAT WAS DISTURBED
NEITHER WIFE PARENTS NOR CHILDREN ARE WAITING FOR HIM BACK HOME
BUT THE NAUTILUS SANK DEEPER STILL
AS FOR ME I WAS HARDLY DRAWN BY THE LURE OF MONEY AND YET WAS FAR FROM THE LEAST ATTENTIVE ON BOARD
WE LEFT THE LOUNGE
HOW THE SHIP WOULD MANEUVER I HADN'T A GUESS
THIS TIME ASTERN
THE ICE STAYED BETWEEN 400 AND 500 METERS DEEP
TWO HOURS LATER THE SAME NOISES THE SAME COMINGS AND GOINGS WERE REPEATED
CAPTAIN NEMO HAD GONE DOWN SOUTH ONLY TO REPLENISH HIS SODIUM SUPPLIES
I'VE NO IDEA HE ANSWERED ME
AS FOR THE WATER NOW BUOYING THE SHIP IT WAS A LAKE COMPLETELY ENCIRCLED BY AN INNER WALL ABOUT TWO MILES IN DIAMETER HENCE SIX MILES AROUND
BUT THIS MYSTERY WOULD INEVITABLY BE CLEARED UP AND SOON BECAUSE CAPTAIN NEMO GAVE ORDERS TO INCREASE SPEED
OFTEN THE HORIZON SEEMED COMPLETELY CLOSED OFF
NEAR SEVEN O'CLOCK WE FINALLY SURVEYED THE BANK OF SHELLFISH WHERE PEARL OYSTERS REPRODUCE BY THE MILLIONS
AT LEAST LET US LEAD THE LIVES OF THE FISH THAT POPULATE THIS LIQUID ELEMENT OR BETTER YET THE LIVES OF AMPHIBIANS WHICH CAN SPEND LONG HOURS EITHER AT SEA OR ON SHORE TRAVELING THROUGH THEIR DOUBLE DOMAIN AS THEIR WHIMS DICTATE
TWO DEGREES HAD ALREADY BEEN GAINED
THESE BEASTS CAN BE QUITE UNPREDICTABLE
IT'S SHELTERED FROM THE STRONGEST WINDS AND THE SEA IS NEVER VERY TURBULENT HERE HIGHLY FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR DIVING WORK
I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM LIT A CIGAR AND WATCHED HIM AT WORK
HE REGARDED IT AS HIS OWN AND HAD LAID THE SAME CLAIM TO IT THAT IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THE WORLD THE FIRST MEN HAD TO THEIR FORESTS ON LAND
VERNE AND HETZEL WERE IN CONSTANT CONFLICT AND THE BOOK WENT THROUGH MULTIPLE DRAFTS STRUGGLES REFLECTED IN ITS SEVERAL WORKING TITLES OVER THE PERIOD 1865-69
AFTER DRESSING THE POOR MAN'S WOUND I REDID THE LINEN BANDAGES AROUND HIS HEAD AND I TURNED TO CAPTAIN NEMO
HAVING NEVER DEALT WITH MAN THEY DIDN'T RUN OFF AT OUR APPROACH AND I COUNTED ENOUGH OF THEM THEREABOUTS TO PROVISION A COUPLE HUNDRED SHIPS
I WAS PUTTING DOWN MY NOVEL HALF READ I WAS WAKING UP AS MY DREAM NEARED ITS CLIMAX
YOU SEE SIR THESE SHARKS ARE BADLY DESIGNED
THE NEXT DAY MARCH 26 I RETURNED TO MY MINER'S TRADE WORKING TO REMOVE THE FIFTH METER
HE WAITED FOR A FEW MINUTES UNTIL THE ORB TOUCHED THE RIM OF THE HORIZON
I STOOD UP AND SAID TO HIM
HOWEVER THOUGH I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT BOTH THE ROUQUAYROL AND RUHMKORFF DEVICES I'D LIKE TO REGISTER SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE RIFLE WITH WHICH YOU'LL EQUIP ME BUT IT ISN'T A RIFLE THAT USES GUNPOWDER THE CAPTAIN REPLIED
THIS HAD TO BE THE CASE
IN THIS WAY WE CAUGHT SEVERAL LOGGERHEADS REPTILES A METER WIDE AND WEIGHING 200 KILOS
I ESTIMATE THAT THE NAUTILUS COVERED A TRACK OF SOME 600 LEAGUES UNDER THE WAVES OF THIS SEA AND THIS VOYAGE WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN JUST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TIMES TWO
NOT A SINGLE DAY OR EVEN A SINGLE HOUR COULD WE AFFORD TO LOSE
A GIGANTIC SHADOW APPEARED ABOVE THE POOR DIVER
NOW THEN I HAVE SUPPLEMENTARY BALLAST TANKS CAPABLE OF SHIPPING 100 METRIC TONS OF WATER
LATER ON THIS NEW ISLAND WILL BE FUSED TO ITS NEIGHBORING ISLAND GROUPS AND A FIFTH CONTINENT WILL STRETCH FROM NEW ZEALAND AND NEW CALEDONIA AS FAR AS THE MARQUESAS ISLANDS
WE HAD RUN AGROUND AT FULL TIDE AND IN ONE OF THOSE SEAS WHOSE TIDES ARE MODERATE AN INCONVENIENT STATE OF AFFAIRS FOR FLOATING THE NAUTILUS OFF
THE OPPORTUNITY MUST BE THE REAL THING
COULDN'T IT BE LAUNCHED DIAGONALLY AGAINST THOSE TRACTS OF ICE WHICH WOULD BREAK OPEN FROM THE IMPACT AH PROFESSOR YOU'RE FULL OF IDEAS TODAY BESIDES CAPTAIN I ADDED WITH STILL GREATER ENTHUSIASM WHY WOULDN'T WE FIND OPEN SEA AT THE SOUTH POLE JUST AS AT THE NORTH POLE
HE WALKED UP AND DOWN SAT AND STOOD PICKED UP A BOOK AT RANDOM DISCARDED IT IMMEDIATELY CONSULTED HIS INSTRUMENTS WITHOUT TAKING HIS CUSTOMARY NOTES AND SEEMED UNABLE TO REST EASY FOR AN INSTANT
I CONTINUED SKETCHING
IT'S LIVING INFINITY AS ONE OF YOUR POETS PUT IT
AN INVITATION IN WRITING 76 16
DOORS WERE CUT INTO THE WATERTIGHT BULKHEADS AND WERE SHUT HERMETICALLY BY MEANS OF INDIA-RUBBER SEALS WHICH INSURED COMPLETE SAFETY ABOARD THE NAUTILUS IN THE EVENT OF A LEAK IN ANY ONE SECTION
IT'S ACTUALLY OUR WORK ROOM AND THERE YOU'LL LEARN THE FULL STORY ABOUT THE NAUTILUS CHAPTER 13 SOME FIGURES A MOMENT LATER WE WERE SEATED ON A COUCH IN THE LOUNGE CIGARS BETWEEN OUR LIPS
THAT SAID YOUR FRIEND CONSEIL IS LISTENING AND HE'S READY TO KEEP SCORE I COULDN'T HELP SMILING AS CONSEIL WIPED HIMSELF OUT OF EXISTENCE
I WAS AT THE END OF MY STRENGTH
I'VE GIVEN ORDERS TO OPEN THE HATCHES WHAT ABOUT THE PAPUANS WHAT ABOUT THEM CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED WITH A LIGHT SHRUG OF HIS SHOULDERS
NEAR THE ISLAND OF SANTORINI PROFESSOR THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED ME AND RIGHT IN THE CHANNEL THAT SEPARATES THE VOLCANIC ISLETS OF NEA KAMENI AND PALEA KAMENI
THE NAUTILUS FOLLOWED IT TO ITS LOWEST REACHES LOCATED 4,431 METERS DOWN AND EVEN THERE IT RESTED WITHOUT ANY STRESS OR STRAIN
BUT THIS LOFTY PLATEAU MEASURED ONLY A FEW FATHOMS AND SOON WE REENTERED OUR ELEMENT
I RECEIVED A LETTER THREE HOURS BEFORE THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN LEFT ITS BROOKLYN PIER THE LETTER READ AS FOLLOWS
PICTURE THOSE EARLY NAVIGATORS VENTURING FORTH IN SAILBOATS BUILT FROM PLANKS LASHED TOGETHER WITH PALM-TREE ROPES CAULKED WITH POWDERED RESIN AND COATED WITH DOGFISH GREASE
SO THEY LODGED A COMPLAINT IN MADRID AND THEY OBTAINED AN ORDER FROM THE INDECISIVE KING PHILIP V
IT WAS FLEEING NOT FIGHTING
DIDN'T IT MEASURE ABOUT SIX METERS SAID CONSEIL WHO WAS STATIONED AT THE WINDOW AND EXAMINING ANEW THE CREVICES IN THE CLIFF
FINALLY IN A MUCH-FEARED SATIRICAL JOURNAL AN ARTICLE BY ITS MOST POPULAR COLUMNIST FINISHED OFF THE MONSTER FOR GOOD SPURNING IT IN THE STYLE OF HIPPOLYTUS REPULSING THE AMOROUS ADVANCES OF HIS STEPMOTHER PHAEDRA AND GIVING THE CREATURE ITS QUIETUS AMID A UNIVERSAL BURST OF LAUGHTER
SOUTHERN PUFFERS WITH RED BACKS AND WHITE CHESTS DISTINGUISHED BY THREE LENGTHWISE ROWS OF FILAMENTS AND JUGFISH SEVEN INCHES LONG DECKED OUT IN THE BRIGHTEST COLORS
BULLHEADS FOREVER SPATTERED WITH MUD WHICH MAKE DISTINCT HISSING SOUNDS
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR US NEVERTHELESS IT WILL HAVE TO DO WHAT
713 827-1345 A COMPLETE UNABRIDGED TRANSLATION OF VINGT MILLES LIEUES SOUS LES MERS BY JULES VERNE BASED ON THE ORIGINAL FRENCH TEXTS PUBLISHED IN PARIS BY J
SIR NED LAND TOLD ME IF THAT BOAT GETS WITHIN A MILE OF US I'M JUMPING OVERBOARD AND I SUGGEST YOU FOLLOW SUIT I DIDN'T REPLY TO THE CANADIAN'S PROPOSITION BUT KEPT WATCHING THE SHIP WHICH WAS LOOMING LARGER ON THE HORIZON
NO MY FRIEND
POOR CONSEIL HAD ASSAULTED AN ELECTRIC RAY OF THE MOST DANGEROUS SPECIES THE CUMANA
IT COULDN'T TEAR ITSELF AWAY FROM THE SETTING OF THIS LAST STRUGGLE FROM THIS SEA THAT HAD DEVOURED ONE OF ITS OWN
OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE AREA ONLY TWO METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED
BUT WHERE DO WE FIND HIM NED LAND ASKED
A SORRY SIGHT THIS CARCASS LOST UNDER THE WAVES BUT SORRIER STILL WAS THE SIGHT ON ITS DECK WHERE LASHED WITH ROPES TO PREVENT THEIR BEING WASHED OVERBOARD SOME HUMAN CORPSES STILL LAY
NO SHADOWS NO BLURS THANKS TO OUR ARTIFICIAL LIGHT
CONSEIL HAD COOLLY REASONED OUT THIS HYPOTHESIS AND LAID HIS PLANS ACCORDINGLY
THE FIRST WORDS I PRONOUNCED WERE WORDS OF APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE TO MY TWO COMPANIONS
IN THE MIDST OF THEIR LEAPING AND CAVORTING WHILE THEY COMPETED WITH EACH OTHER IN BEAUTY RADIANCE AND SPEED I COULD DISTINGUISH SOME GREEN WRASSE BEWHISKERED MULLET MARKED WITH PAIRS OF BLACK LINES WHITE GOBIES FROM THE GENUS ELEOTRIS WITH CURVED CAUDAL FINS AND VIOLET SPOTS ON THE BACK WONDERFUL JAPANESE MACKEREL FROM THE GENUS SCOMBER WITH BLUE BODIES AND SILVER HEADS GLITTERING AZURE GOLDFISH WHOSE NAME BY ITSELF GIVES THEIR FULL DESCRIPTION SEVERAL VARIETIES OF PORGY OR GILTHEAD SOME BANDED GILTHEAD WITH FINS VARIOUSLY BLUE AND YELLOW SOME WITH HORIZONTAL HERALDIC BARS AND ENHANCED BY A BLACK STRIP AROUND THEIR CAUDAL AREA SOME WITH COLOR ZONES AND ELEGANTLY CORSETED IN THEIR SIX WAISTBANDS TRUMPETFISH WITH FLUTELIKE BEAKS THAT LOOKED LIKE GENUINE SEAFARING WOODCOCKS AND WERE SOMETIMES A METER LONG JAPANESE SALAMANDERS SERPENTINE MORAY EELS FROM THE GENUS ECHIDNA THAT WERE SIX FEET LONG WITH SHARP LITTLE EYES AND A HUGE MOUTH BRISTLING WITH TEETH
ITS HULL LOOKED IN GOOD CONDITION AND IT MUST HAVE GONE UNDER ONLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE
I REPLIED IN CLEAR FRENCH THAT I WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH HIS LANGUAGE
WE HAD REACHED THAT INACCESSIBLE SPOT WITHOUT FACING EXHAUSTION OR DANGER AS IF OUR SEAGOING PASSENGER CARRIAGE HAD GLIDED THERE ON RAILROAD TRACKS
MY CLOTHES WERE WEIGHING ME DOWN
NEAR SEVEN O'CLOCK NED AND CONSEIL JOINED ME
THE GREEK AND LATIN HISTORIANS CAN FIND NOTHING TO SAY IN ITS FAVOR AND THE GREEK GEOGRAPHER STRABO ADDS THAT IT'S ESPECIALLY ROUGH DURING THE RAINY SEASON AND THE PERIOD OF SUMMER PREVAILING WINDS
NO DOUBT HE HAD OFTEN TRAVELED IT AND WAS INCAPABLE OF LOSING HIS WAY
ITS CLARITY IS BELIEVED TO EXCEED THAT OF SPRING WATER
AFTER CROSSING A PRETTY LUSH PRAIRIE WE ARRIVED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF A SMALL WOOD ENLIVENED BY THE SINGING AND SOARING OF A LARGE NUMBER OF BIRDS
EXOTIC COCKLES FROM SENEGAL FRAGILE WHITE BIVALVE SHELLS THAT A SINGLE BREATH COULD POP LIKE A SOAP BUBBLE
THE SUNSHINE COMING THROUGH THE CRATER HAD GROWN STRONGER SHEDDING A HAZY LIGHT OVER ALL THE VOLCANIC WASTE FOREVER BURIED IN THE HEART OF THIS EXTINCT MOUNTAIN
I VENTURED TO COMMENT ON IT TO MY COMPANIONS
THE OCEAN WAS OBSERVED WITH RENEWED CARE
KILOMETER ROUGHLY 6/10 OF A MILE
AMONG THE VARIOUS FISH INHABITING IT SOME I VIEWED OTHERS I GLIMPSED AND THE REST I MISSED COMPLETELY BECAUSE OF THE NAUTILUS'S SPEED
AND HOW MANY OF THESE OYSTERS FOR WHICH HE RISKED HIS LIFE WOULD HAVE NO PEARL IN THEM
THIS WAS HUMILIATING FOR ONE OF THE FASTEST RACERS IN THE AMERICAN NAVY
I TRIED TO KEEP MY EYES OPEN BUT THEY CLOSED IN SPITE OF ME
BUT THEIR WATERS OF CHOICE ARE THE RED SEA AND THE MEDITERRANEAN NEAR THE GREEK ISLANDS OR THE COAST OF SYRIA
BALLARD FINDER OF THE SUNKEN TITANIC CONFESSES THAT THIS WAS HIS FAVORITE BOOK AS A TEENAGER AND COUSTEAU HIMSELF MOST RENOWNED OF MARINE EXPLORERS CALLED IT HIS SHIPBOARD BIBLE
I OBSERVED THAT GREEN-COLORED PLANTS KEPT CLOSER TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA WHILE REDS OCCUPIED A MEDIUM DEPTH WHICH LEFT BLACKS AND BROWNS IN CHARGE OF DESIGNING GARDENS AND FLOWERBEDS IN THE OCEAN'S LOWER STRATA
I'VE NO IDEA NED REPLIED
NED LAND WENT WESTWARD UP THE COAST
AMONG OTHERS I NOTED THAT SAND GOBY MENTIONED BY ARISTOTLE AND COMMONLY KNOWN BY THE NAME SEA LOACH WHICH IS ENCOUNTERED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE SALTY WATERS NEXT TO THE NILE DELTA
THESE VARIOUS FOOD ITEMS SEEMED TO BE RICH IN PHOSPHOROUS AND I THOUGHT THAT THEY TOO MUST HAVE BEEN OF MARINE ORIGIN
AND YOU PROFESSOR KINDLY LISTEN TO ME CHAPTER 10 THE MAN OF THE WATERS IT WAS THE SHIP'S COMMANDER WHO HAD JUST SPOKEN
IT'S THE SAME WITH WHALERS
THEY HAVE TO ROLL THEIR BELLIES OVER TO SNAP YOU UP AND IN THE MEANTIME NED LAND HAD A WAY OF PRONOUNCING THE WORD SNAP THAT SENT CHILLS DOWN THE SPINE
THEN NOT BOTHERING TO DIVE IT GOT UP A LITTLE SPEED RETREATED AND WAS CONTENT TO KEEP ITS DISTANCE
THERE HE WAS ABLE TO INTEREST THE ASIATIC SOCIETY AND THE EAST INDIA COMPANY IN HIS DISCOVERY
CAPTAIN NEMO WAS THERE WAITING FOR ME
IT HAD TO BE MARCH 28
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT CAPTAIN NEMO WAS COURTING A DEATH WORTHY OF HIMSELF SEEKING TO BE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
AND HOW I RESENTED THE OFFHAND MANNER IN WHICH THE CAPTAIN HAD EXTENDED HIS DEPLORABLE INVITATION
IN OTHER WORDS YOU'D BE SQUASHED AS FLAT AS IF YOU'D JUST BEEN YANKED FROM BETWEEN THE PLATES OF A HYDRAULIC PRESS FIRE AND BRIMSTONE NED PUT IN
CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF GIN I'VE HAD THESE PAST TWO MONTHS YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT MEANWHILE I WAS EXAMINING THIS UNUSUAL BIRD
EVEN SO CAPTAIN NEMO RUSHED AT THE DEVILFISH AND WITH A SWEEP OF THE AX HEWED ONE MORE OF ITS ARMS
I HOPE SO
I DRESSED WARMLY
NO SAILS FOR THE WIND TO CARRY OFF
ALLOW ME TO LEAD THE WAY YOURS TO COMMAND CAPTAIN I FOLLOWED CAPTAIN NEMO AND AS SOON AS I PASSED THROUGH THE DOORWAY I WENT DOWN A KIND OF ELECTRICALLY LIT PASSAGEWAY THAT RESEMBLED A GANGWAY ON A SHIP
FROM THAT DAY ON I NOTED WITH SOME UNEASINESS THAT NED LAND'S ATTITUDES TOWARD CAPTAIN NEMO GREW WORSE AND WORSE AND I DECIDED TO KEEP A CLOSE WATCH ON THE CANADIAN'S MOVEMENTS AND ACTIVITIES
I ALSO CAUGHT ONLY A GLIMPSE OF LITTLE ROTI ISLAND PART OF THIS SAME GROUP WHOSE WOMEN HAVE A WELL-ESTABLISHED REPUTATION FOR BEAUTY IN THE MALAYSIAN MARKETPLACE
THROWN INTO THE SEA THE SUCKERFISH IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO PLAY THEIR ROLES GOING AND FASTENING THEMSELVES ONTO THE BREASTPLATES OF THE TURTLES
IT JUST RIDES WITH THE WAVES BUT OTHERWISE IT HASN'T STIRRED BUT WE KNOW THAT IT'S CERTAINLY GIFTED WITH GREAT SPEED
THE SAILORS WENT BACK TO THEIR SCULLING AND THE COXSWAIN STEERED THE LONGBOAT TOWARD THE FLOATING BARREL
THEIR CAUTIOUS BEHAVIOR PROVED TO ME THAT THESE WINGED CREATURES KNEW WHERE THEY STOOD ON BIPEDS OF OUR SPECIES AND I CONCLUDED THAT IF THIS ISLAND WASN'T INHABITED AT LEAST HUMAN BEINGS PAID IT FREQUENT VISITS
NOT A SINGLE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE PAST TEN PACES
BUT PAYING NO ATTENTION TO US THEY POUNCED ON THE CORPSE AND QUARRELED OVER EVERY SCRAP OF IT
NED I EXCLAIMED
AS FOR THE LOCAL FAUNA IT INCLUDED THOUSANDS OF CRUSTACEANS OF EVERY TYPE
BESIDES WHEN IT'S AN ISSUE OF MONSTERS THE HUMAN IMAGINATION ALWAYS TENDS TO RUN WILD
VIA THIS STRAND YOU COULD EASILY CIRCLE THE LAKE
PULL OUT OF YOUR BAG OF TRICKS THE BEST ENGLISH EVER SPOKEN BY AN ANGLO-SAXON AND TRY FOR A MORE FAVORABLE RESULT THAN MINE NED NEEDED NO PERSUADING AND STARTED OUR STORY ALL OVER AGAIN MOST OF WHICH I COULD FOLLOW
SOME WERE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES
PROFESSOR HE SAID LISTEN CAREFULLY
ITS THREE MASTS GONE WATER IN ITS HOLD A THIRD OF ITS CREW OUT OF ACTION IT PREFERRED TO GO TO THE BOTTOM WITH ITS 356 SEAMEN RATHER THAN SURRENDER
WE ACCEPT I REPLIED
I FOLLOWED A GUIDE WHO WAS IMMUNE TO EXHAUSTION
THE MANROPES THAT FORMED A HANDRAIL AROUND THE PLATFORM WERE LOWERED
SO THE NAUTILUS HOVE BEFORE THE ENTRANCE TO THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS STRAIT A PASSAGEWAY THAT EVEN THE BOLDEST NAVIGATORS HESITATED TO CLEAR
THE INSIDE DOOR OPENED AND WE PASSED INTO THE WARDROBE
I FOLLOWED HIM
I SPOTTED THIS FACT IN THE PERPENDICULARITY OF THE SUN'S RAYS WHICH WERE NO LONGER REFRACTED
JUST THEN THE WHOLE CREW RETURNED ON BOARD AND THE DOUBLE OUTSIDE DOOR WAS CLOSED
MISTS WERE RISING FROM THE COLD SURFACE OF THE WATER
AT LAST ON MARCH 18 AFTER TWENTY FUTILE ASSAULTS THE NAUTILUS WAS DECISIVELY HELD IN CHECK
IT'S ONLY A CLUSTER OF PHOSPHORESCENT PARTICLES EXCLAIMED ONE OF THE OFFICERS
AND TO SIGHT IT CALLED FOR ENCOUNTERING IT WHICH WAS A CHANCY BUSINESS
AND SO AFTER THEY'VE FINISHED DEPRIVING OUR WATER DROP OF ITS MINERAL NUTRIENTS THE DROPLET GETS LIGHTER RISES TO THE SURFACE THERE ABSORBS MORE SALTS LEFT BEHIND THROUGH EVAPORATION GETS HEAVIER SINKS AGAIN AND BRINGS THOSE TINY ANIMALS NEW ELEMENTS TO ABSORB
WRONG NED MY FRIEND CONSEIL ANSWERED BECAUSE I SEE ONLY ORDINARY PARROTS HERE CONSEIL MY FRIEND NED REPLIED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS PARROTS ARE LIKE PHEASANT TO PEOPLE WITH NOTHING ELSE ON THEIR PLATES AND I MIGHT ADD I SAID THAT WHEN THESE BIRDS ARE PROPERLY COOKED THEY'RE AT LEAST WORTH A STAB OF THE FORK INDEED UNDER THE DENSE FOLIAGE OF THIS WOOD A WHOLE HOST OF PARROTS FLUTTERED FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH NEEDING ONLY THE PROPER UPBRINGING TO SPEAK HUMAN DIALECTS
IT WAS A STEEL SPINDLE OBEDIENTLY IN MOTION WITHOUT RIGGING OR MASTING AND ABLE TO BRAVE THEIR FURY WITH IMPUNITY
IT'S COMPLETELY DECKED OVER ABSOLUTELY WATERTIGHT AND HELD SOLIDLY IN PLACE BY BOLTS
NEAR ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING I RECEIVED A MOST UNEXPECTED VISIT FROM CAPTAIN NEMO
TIME WOULD TELL
TIME WOULD TELL
THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY A BLIND ALLEY WITH NO POSSIBLE OUTLET
THOSE BEASTS GO BY THE NAME OF KRAKE FAKE IS MORE LIKE IT THE CANADIAN REPLIED SARCASTICALLY
HOW DO YOU REPLACE IT SINCE YOU NO LONGER STAY IN CONTACT WITH THE SHORE THAT QUESTION DESERVES AN ANSWER CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED
BUT I WAS GIVEN A CHANCE TO MARVEL AT IT SOON ENOUGH
NOW THEN WE'VE BEEN BURIED BENEATH THE WATERS FOR THIRTY-SIX HOURS AND THE NAUTILUS'S HEAVY ATMOSPHERE ALREADY NEEDS RENEWING
CAPTAIN NEMO BROUGHT A REAL PASSION TO THEM
HE'S HAUNTED BY HIS FORMER LIFE
ONLY I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY A HAPPY YEAR UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE'RE PLACED
CONSEQUENTLY I'D HAVE TO INCREASE MY WEIGHT FROM 1,507.2 METRIC TONS TO 1,513.77
I DID SO AND FOUND CAPTAIN NEMO BUSY WITH CALCULATIONS IN WHICH THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE OF X AND OTHER ALGEBRAIC SIGNS
THE RED SEA 160 5
THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT SAVINGS FOR CAPTAIN NEMO WHO COULDN'T EASILY RENEW THEM
I'D HAD TIME TO COLLECT MYSELF
IF ON THE OTHER HAND WE DO KNOW EVERY LIVING SPECIES WE MUST LOOK FOR THE ANIMAL IN QUESTION AMONG THOSE MARINE CREATURES ALREADY CATALOGED AND IN THIS EVENT I WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF A GIANT NARWHALE
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED PROFESSOR ARONNAX IN VISITING ONE OF THOSE FISHERIES CERTAINLY CAPTAIN FINE
BY THE NEXT DAY MARCH 27 SIX METERS OF ICE HAD BEEN TORN FROM THE SOCKET
YAWNS DISLOCATED MY JAWS
NED LAND RUSHED TO THE WINDOW
HE MUST HAVE BEEN A MADO OF HIGH RANK BECAUSE HE PARADED IN A MAT OF BANANA LEAVES THAT HAD RAGGED EDGES AND WAS ACCENTED WITH BRIGHT COLORS
TOMORROW MIGHT NOT CAPTAIN NEMO TAKE US FAR AWAY FROM ANY SHORE
ITS HOLE WAS REAL ENOUGH THAT IT HAD TO BE PLUGGED UP AND I DON'T THINK A HOLE'S EXISTENCE CAN BE MORE EMPHATICALLY PROVEN
I TURNED TO CAPTAIN NEMO AND IN AN AGITATED VOICE
THESE FEATHERS ARE GATHERED BY THE FOWL FORGERS AND SKILLFULLY FITTED ONTO SOME POOR PREVIOUSLY MUTILATED PARAKEET
WE THEN PLOWED THE WAVES OF THE INDIAN OCEAN VAST LIQUID PLAINS WITH AN AREA OF 550,000,000 HECTARES WHOSE WATERS ARE SO TRANSPARENT IT MAKES YOU DIZZY TO LEAN OVER THEIR SURFACE
TIT FOR TAT CAPTAIN NED LAND REPLIED
AN INDISPUTABLE EVENT MY GALLANT NED
I GREW PALE
24 AND LONGITUDE 17
YET THIS LOOSE STRUCTURE GIVES THE NOVEL AN AIR OF DOCUMENTARY REALISM
IT THEN DIVIDES INTO TWO ARMS NEAR THE 43RD PARALLEL
HE HOPES NOTHING WILL PREVENT THE PROFESSOR FROM ATTENDING AND HE LOOKS FORWARD WITH PLEASURE TO THE PROFESSOR'S COMPANIONS JOINING HIM
I UNDO THE BOLTS HOLDING THE SKIFF TO THE SUBMERSIBLE AND THE LONGBOAT RISES WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
FROM BEYOND THIS RIDGE THERE CAME FEARSOME BELLOWS SUCH AS A HERD OF CATTLE MIGHT PRODUCE
OBVIOUSLY THIS SOUTHERNMOST BASIN FROZE OVER DURING ITS SIX-MONTH WINTER AND BECAME UTTERLY INACCESSIBLE
THE NAUTILUS WENT INTO THESE BRITTLE MASSES LIKE A WEDGE SPLITTING THEM WITH DREADFUL CRACKLINGS
I NOTED SOME WOMEN AMONG THEM DRESSED FROM HIP TO KNEE IN GRASS SKIRTS HELD UP BY BELTS MADE OF VEGETATION
ONE WOULD THINK HE WAS IN FRONT OF AN AQUARIUM NO I REPLIED BECAUSE AN AQUARIUM IS NOTHING MORE THAN A CAGE AND THESE FISH ARE AS FREE AS BIRDS IN THE AIR WELL CONSEIL MY FRIEND IDENTIFY THEM
AND I HADN'T THE FOGGIEST INKLING THAT SAILORS LUCK WAS ABOUT TO BRING ME FACE TO FACE WITH THESE DAUNTING ANDAMAN ABORIGINES
THEIR UTMOST PRESSURE--IT HAS BEEN CALCULATED CAN BUILD TO 3,000 KILOGRAMS ON EVERY SQUARE FOOT OF SURFACE THEY STRIKE
THE ICE BANK THE CANADIAN TOLD ME
AN AMAZING CHARACTER THIS BOY
PROGRESS IS SLOW PROFESSOR ARONNAX IT'S TRUE I REPLIED
I REENTERED MY STATEROOM WHERE NED AND CONSEIL WERE WAITING SILENTLY
AREN'T YOU COMING CAPTAIN I ASKED
BIRDS OF PARADISE STOLE OFF AT OUR APPROACH AND I WAS IN REAL DESPAIR OF CATCHING ONE WHEN CONSEIL WALKING IN THE LEAD STOOPED SUDDENLY GAVE A TRIUMPHANT SHOUT AND CAME BACK TO ME CARRYING A MAGNIFICENT BIRD OF PARADISE
JUST THEN A FAIRLY LOUD HISSING TOLD ME THAT THE BALLAST TANKS WERE FILLING AND THE NAUTILUS SANK BENEATH THE WAVES OF THE ATLANTIC
NOTHING BUT THE IMMENSENESS OF THE SEA
HENCE THESE TAPIRO WERE MUCH IN DEMAND BY THE EPICURES OF ANCIENT ROME AND THEIR ENTRAILS WERE DRESSED WITH BRAINS OF PEACOCK TONGUE OF FLAMINGO AND TESTES OF MORAY TO MAKE THAT DIVINE PLATTER THAT SO ENRAPTURED THE ROMAN EMPEROR VITELLIUS
MY FRIENDS I SAID IT'S TIME
LIKEWISE THE PILOTHOUSE AND THE BEACON HOUSING WERE WITHDRAWN INTO THE HULL UNTIL THEY LAY EXACTLY FLUSH WITH IT
IF I WERE ON BOARD A WHALER THERE'S AN ENCOUNTER THAT WOULD BE GREAT FUN
I LIT IT AT A SMALL BRAZIER SUPPORTED BY AN ELEGANT BRONZE STAND AND I INHALED MY FIRST WHIFFS WITH THE RELISH OF A SMOKER WHO HASN'T HAD A PUFF IN DAYS
THE MONSTER AGAIN BECAME AN ISLET ROCK OR REEF BUT A RUNAWAY REEF UNFIXED AND ELUSIVE
TO HARPOON IT CALLED FOR SIGHTING IT WHICH WAS THE CREW'S BUSINESS
THE NAUTILUS WOULD DO LONG DIAGONAL DIVES THAT TOOK US TO EVERY LEVEL
FOUR-EYED FISH FROM SURINAM ETC
IT WAS AN OYSTER OF EXTRAORDINARY DIMENSIONS A TITANIC GIANT CLAM A HOLY-WATER FONT THAT COULD HAVE HELD A WHOLE LAKE A BASIN MORE THAN TWO METERS WIDE HENCE EVEN BIGGER THAN THE ONE ADORNING THE NAUTILUS'S LOUNGE
SOME STILL WEREN'T RIPE ENOUGH AND THEIR THICK SKINS COVERED WHITE SLIGHTLY FIBROUS PULPS
I HADN'T SEEN THE CAPTAIN SINCE OUR VISIT TO THE ISLAND OF SANTORINI
A TYPE OF RAY FROM THE GENUS OXYRHYNCHUS FIVE FEET WIDE HAD A WHITE BELLY WITH A SPOTTED ASH-GRAY BACK AND WAS CARRIED ALONG BY THE CURRENTS LIKE A HUGE WIDE-OPEN SHAWL
FISH
THESE ANIMALS WERE PLAYING AMONG THEMSELVES
FOR AN HOUR PLAINS OF SAND UNROLLED BEFORE OUR STEPS
IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERY MASS BRIGHTLY LIT BY OUR ELECTRIC BEAMS THERE SNAKED PAST THOSE ONE-METER LAMPREYS THAT ARE COMMON TO NEARLY EVERY CLIME
NOTHING HAD CHANGED IN ITS INTERIOR ARRANGEMENTS
HIS FACE LOOKED EXHAUSTED
OBVIOUSLY THE NAUTILUS WAS STRAIGHTENING A BIT
PRECISELY I REPLIED
DURING OUR STROLL TOMORROW WHO SAYS WE WON'T RUN INTO ONE JUST LIKE IT BAH CONSEIL PUT IN
DURING THIS MEMORABLE CAMPAIGN JOURNALISTS MAKING A PROFESSION OF SCIENCE BATTLED WITH THOSE MAKING A PROFESSION OF WIT SPILLING WAVES OF INK AND SOME OF THEM EVEN TWO OR THREE DROPS OF BLOOD SINCE THEY WENT FROM SEA SERPENTS TO THE MOST OFFENSIVE PERSONAL REMARKS
THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT TERRIFIED ME
IT'S A CHINESE TRIGGERFISH NED LAND REPLIED
WE ARRIVED AT THE MOUNTAIN'S LOWER GRADIENTS
SOMETIMES I HEARD MELANCHOLY SOUNDS REVERBERATING FROM THE ORGAN WHICH HE PLAYED VERY EXPRESSIVELY BUT ONLY AT NIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST SECRETIVE DARKNESS WHILE THE NAUTILUS SLUMBERED IN THE WILDERNESS OF THE OCEAN
NO MORE SHORE IN SIGHT
THE MAN WAS A SORT OF KNIGHT OF RHODES A LATTER-DAY SIR DIEUDONNé OF GOZO ON HIS WAY TO FIGHT AN ENCOUNTER WITH THE DRAGON DEVASTATING THE ISLAND
SOME MOMENTS LATER WE SAW A DOZEN CREWMEN SET FOOT ON THE SHELF OF ICE AMONG THEM NED LAND EASILY RECOGNIZED BY HIS TALL FIGURE
COMMANDER LA PéROUSE SET OUT ON DECEMBER 7 1785 WITH HIS SHIPS THE COMPASS AND THE ASTROLABE
BUT WE FACED IT HEAD-ON EACH ONE OF US DETERMINED TO DO HIS DUTY TO THE END
TO CAST OFF HE NEEDED ONLY TO FIRE AND STOKE HIS FURNACES
THE PROPELLER CHURNED THE WAVES MORE SWIFTLY
I GOT READY TO RECORD THE RESULTS OF THIS EXPERIMENT
DID YOUR STUDY AT THE MUSEUM AFFORD YOU SUCH A PERFECT RETREAT NO SIR AND I MIGHT ADD THAT IT'S QUITE A HUMBLE ONE NEXT TO YOURS
SUDDENLY I LET OUT A YELL
THE RAY AND THE SHARK WHAT NED LAND EXCLAIMED
DOES THIS MEAN I'LL WAKE UP HALF DEVOURED ONE FINE DAY I'M AWFULLY FOND OF YOU CONSEIL MY FRIEND BUT NOT ENOUGH TO EAT YOU WHEN THERE'S BETTER FOOD AROUND THEN I DAREN'T DELAY CONSEIL REPLIED
THE COMMANDER STOOD HIS GROUND
FINALLY
BUT WHAT I SAW WAS SIMPLY A REFLECTION PRODUCED BY THE CRYSTAL WATERS OF THESE STRATA
HE COMPLAINED VEHEMENTLY ABOUT BEING IMPRISONED IN DEFIANCE OF HIS CIVIL RIGHTS ASKED BY VIRTUE OF WHICH LAW HE WAS HEREBY DETAINED INVOKED WRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS THREATENED TO PRESS CHARGES AGAINST ANYONE HOLDING HIM IN ILLEGAL CUSTODY RANTED GESTICULATED SHOUTED AND FINALLY CONVEYED BY AN EXPRESSIVE GESTURE THAT WE WERE DYING OF HUNGER
SUCH A PHENOMENON WON'T OCCUR
BUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL VENTURED TO OBSERVE IT'S LIKE AN ACTUAL ISTHMUS CONNECTING EUROPE TO AFRICA YES MY BOY I REPLIED IT CUTS ACROSS THE WHOLE STRAIT OF SICILY AND SMITH'S SOUNDINGS PROVE THAT IN THE PAST THESE TWO CONTINENTS WERE GENUINELY CONNECTED BETWEEN CAPE BOEO AND CAPE FARINA I CAN EASILY BELIEVE IT CONSEIL SAID
HIS SAILORS COULDN'T HIDE THEIR DISCONTENT AND THEIR WORK SUFFERED BECAUSE OF IT
THE OCEAN OUTSIDE IS RISING AND BY A PERFECTLY NATURAL LAW OF BALANCE THE LEVEL OF THIS LAKE IS ALSO RISING
INITIALLY VERNE'S NARRATIVE WAS INFLUENCED BY THE 1863 UPRISING OF POLAND AGAINST TSARIST RUSSIA
CAPTAIN NEMO DIDN'T STOP STUDYING THE PRESSURE GAUGE
THERE'LL BE MORE LEFT OVER A WORD OF CAUTION MR LAND I TOLD THE HARPOONER WHO WAS ABOUT TO RAVAGE ANOTHER COCONUT PALM
MASTER IS TOO KIND CONSEIL REPLIED
IN 1840 THIS SHREWD INDUSTRIALIST FOUNDED A POSTAL SERVICE BETWEEN LIVERPOOL AND HALIFAX FEATURING THREE WOODEN SHIPS WITH 400-HORSEPOWER PADDLE WHEELS AND A BURDEN OF 1,162 METRIC TONS
JUST THEN THE CREWMEN FINISHED LOADING THE SODIUM SUPPLIES AND THE NAUTILUS COULD HAVE DEPARTED IMMEDIATELY
IT HAD NED LAND THE KING OF HARPOONERS
THESE THOUGHTS SWIFTLY CROSSED MY MIND WHILE THIS STRANGE INDIVIDUAL FELL SILENT LIKE SOMEONE COMPLETELY SELF-ABSORBED
SINAI ON WHOSE SUMMIT MOSES MET GOD FACE TO FACE THAT SUMMIT THE MIND'S EYE ALWAYS PICTURES AS WREATHED IN LIGHTNING
MY HEAVY SOLES WERE CRUSHING THE SKELETONS OF ANIMALS FROM THE AGE OF FABLE ANIMALS THAT USED TO TAKE COVER IN THE SHADE OF THESE TREES NOW TURNED TO STONE
HE WENT ON WITH THE CONVERSATION AS FOLLOWS
120 MINUTES I WAS KEEPING TRACK OF THEM--STILL SEPARATED ME FROM THE MOMENT I WAS TO REJOIN NED LAND
GOING BACK UNDER THE WATERS THE NAUTILUS DREW NEAR THE COAST CRUISING ALONG IT FOR ONLY A FEW MILES
BUT I PREFERRED TO USE A MORE PRACTICAL PROCEDURE AND THAT IS YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE COMPOSITION OF SALT WATER
NED LAND TRIED TO LODGE A COMPLAINT BUT THE ONLY ANSWER HE GOT WAS A DOOR SHUT IN HIS FACE
TO A MODERN SHIP WELL RIGGED SOLIDLY CONSTRUCTED AND IN CONTROL OF ITS COURSE THANKS TO OBEDIENT STEAM SOME CONDITIONS ARE NO LONGER HAZARDOUS THAT OFFERED ALL SORTS OF DANGERS TO THE VESSELS OF THE ANCIENTS
YOUR LIFE IS WORTH MORE THAN OURS
CAPTAIN NEMO HAD AN EXPLICIT PERSONAL INTEREST IN CHECKING ON THE CURRENT CONDITION OF THIS GIANT CLAM
HAVING NOTHING BETTER TO DO I DECIDED TO DREDGE THESE BEAUTIFUL CLEAR WATERS WHICH EXHIBITED A PROFUSION OF SHELLS ZOOPHYTES AND OPEN-SEA PLANTS
HE WOULD HAVE SEEN IT AS HIS SWORN DUTY TO DESTROY A CONTRIVANCE OF THIS KIND JUST AS PROMPTLY AS A GIGANTIC NARWHALE
I LEFT THE CAPTAIN IN THE DYING MAN'S CABIN AND I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM VERY MOVED BY THIS SCENE
I APPROACHED THIS PHENOMENAL MOLLUSK
THE SEA WAS SWELLING AND SURGING
PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE TOLD ME IN A TONE OF SOME URGENCY I ASK THAT YOU NOW HONOR ONE OF THE BINDING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN US WHICH ONE CAPTAIN YOU AND YOUR COMPANIONS MUST BE PLACED IN CONFINEMENT UNTIL I SEE FIT TO SET YOU FREE YOU'RE IN COMMAND I ANSWERED GAPING AT HIM
TIPSY FROM THAT POTENT JUICE OUR BIRD OF PARADISE HAD BEEN REDUCED TO HELPLESSNESS
HAD WE CLEARED THE ICE BANK
I MIGHT ADD THAT THESE CAPSULES ARE NO BIGGER THAN NUMBER 4 SHOT AND THE CHAMBER OF ANY ORDINARY RIFLE COULD HOLD TEN OF THEM I'LL QUIT DEBATING I REPLIED GETTING UP FROM THE TABLE
BUILT TO PURSUE IT WAS BEING PURSUED AND I COMMENTED ON THIS TO COMMANDER FARRAGUT
WE WON'T SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN BEFORE WE GO
THE WAVES GREW TRANQUIL AGAIN
THERE MY EYES FELL ON THE COMPASS
I'D HARDLY CALL THIS SHORE THE CANADIAN REPLIED
BUT CAPTAIN NEMO REMAINED CONTENT WITH INVITING ME TO FOLLOW HIM AND I DID SO LIKE A MAN RESIGNED TO THE WORST
FOR EACH FOOT OF ICEBERG ABOVE THE SEA THERE ARE THREE MORE BELOW
CONSEQUENTLY TO CALCULATE THE VALUE OF THIS COLLECTION WAS I SHOULD SAY IMPOSSIBLE
MANY OF OUR SAILORS SWORE THAT THE MONSTER COULDN'T NEGOTIATE THIS PASSAGEWAY SIMPLY BECAUSE HE'S TOO BIG FOR IT NEAR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ON JULY 6 FIFTEEN MILES SOUTH OF SHORE THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN DOUBLED THAT SOLITARY ISLET AT THE TIP OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN CONTINENT THAT STRAY ROCK DUTCH SEAMEN HAD NAMED CAPE HORN AFTER THEIR HOMETOWN OF HOORN
WAS IT STILL NIGHT
WELL I SAID THESE ARE REAL DEVILFISH CAVERNS AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOME OF THOSE MONSTERS HEREABOUTS WHAT CONSEIL PUT IN
IN 1838 THE FRENCHMAN DUMONT D'URVILLE STOPPED AT THE ICE BANK IN LATITUDE 62 DEGREES 57 SIGHTING THE LOUIS-PHILIPPE PENINSULA
THEY GO TO THESE HOLES TO BREATHE
NED AND CONSEIL HAD KEPT ME ALIVE DURING THE FINAL HOURS OF OUR LONG DEATH THROES
WHO KNOWS WHETHER WE'LL SEE A SECOND NAUTILUS WITHIN THE NEXT 100 YEARS
NO MORE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
THE NEXT DAY APRIL 1 WHEN THE NAUTILUS ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES BEFORE NOON WE RAISED LAND TO THE WEST
IN ESSENCE MANATEES LIKE SEALS ARE DESIGNED TO GRAZE THE UNDERWATER PRAIRIES DESTROYING THE CLUSTERS OF WEEDS THAT OBSTRUCT THE MOUTHS OF TROPICAL RIVERS
AND SO THE MONSTER SURFACED AGAIN DESPITE THE ENDLESS WITTICISMS HEAPED ON IT BY THE POPULAR PRESS AND THE HUMAN IMAGINATION SOON GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE MOST RIDICULOUS ICHTHYOLOGICAL FANTASIES
TWO O'CLOCK AT LEAST CONSEIL REPLIED
EVEN IN A TEMPERATURE OF MERELY 5 DEGREES CENTIGRADE EVERY OUTSIDE PART OF THE NAUTILUS WAS COVERED WITH ICE
ONLY SIR I ADDED I'LL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF ADDRESSING A QUESTION TO YOU ADDRESS AWAY PROFESSOR ARONNAX AND IF I'M ABLE TO ANSWER I WILL WELL THEN CAPTAIN HOW IS IT THAT YOU'VE SEVERED ALL TIES WITH THE SHORE YET YOU OWN FORESTS ON CRESPO ISLAND PROFESSOR THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED ME THESE FORESTS OF MINE DON'T BASK IN THE HEAT AND LIGHT OF THE SUN
BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT NOT A SINGLE DOGFISH LET ITSELF GET CAUGHT IN THE NAUTILUS'S NETS SO I CAN'T VOUCH FOR THEIR VORACITY
AT 2:35 CAPTAIN NEMO APPEARED IN THE LOUNGE
NEAR THE AFTERNOON IT WAS ALREADY CRUISING UNDER THE IMMENSE FROZEN CARAPACE OF THE ICE BANK
I WANTED TO CONSULT THE COMPASS
IN EVERY BIG CITY THE MONSTER WAS THE LATEST RAGE
WITH THEIR SMOOTH VISCOUS FILAMENTS THEY MEASURED AS MUCH AS 300 METERS LONG
THERE THE LOCAL FLORA WAS REPRESENTED BY A WIDE CARPET OF SAMPHIRE A SMALL UMBELLIFEROUS PLANT THAT KEEPS QUITE NICELY WHICH ALSO BOASTS THE NAMES GLASSWORT SAXIFRAGE AND SEA FENNEL
BUT NOTHING IN HIS FACIAL EXPRESSION INDICATED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD MY STORY
I THEN REMEMBERED THAT THIS LOYAL GOOD-NATURED SATELLITE WOULD RETURN TO THIS SAME PLACE THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW TO RAISE THE TIDE AND TEAR THE NAUTILUS FROM ITS CORAL BED
REIGNING MORE OR LESS POORLY UNDER THE NAME KING PHILIP V THIS ARISTOCRAT HAD TO DEAL WITH MIGHTY OPPONENTS ABROAD
LOOK AT ME--IN ECSTASY OVER FRESHLY GRILLED PORK
THEY WERE LIKE MONSTROUS FIREFLIES THAT COULD THOROUGHLY PULVERIZE A MAN IN THEIR IRON JAWS
SUCH A LEAK COULD NOT BE PATCHED AND WITH ITS PADDLE WHEELS HALF SWAMPED THE SCOTIA HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO CONTINUE ITS VOYAGE
SUDDENLY THE CLOCK STRUCK EIGHT
YOU WILL BE GOING WITH US RIGHT ME
I WANTED NO ARGUMENTS
SOON WE WERE IMPRISONED UP TO THE NECK IN INDIA-RUBBER CLOTHING AND STRAPS FASTENED THE AIR DEVICES ONTO OUR BACKS
WHEN HIS TIME WAS UP HE YIELDED HIS EQUIPMENT TO ANOTHER AND REENTERED THE FOUL AIR ON BOARD ALWAYS CALM UNFLINCHING AND UNCOMPLAINING
NEAR NOON I WAS ON THE PLATFORM WITH CONSEIL
FLOATING ON ITS SIDE ITS BELLY RIDDLED WITH BITES THE POOR CETACEAN WAS DEAD
IF MASTER WILL AUTHORIZE ME I'LL TELL THE WHOLE BUSINESS IN GERMAN WHAT
YES NED LAND WENT ON
THEY FLOATED LIKE WRECKAGE FROM A SHIP SOMETIMES FASTENING ONTO OUR WINDOWS LIKE OPAQUE SHUTTERS
WE'LL SOON SEE NED LAND REPLIED SHAKING HIS HEAD WITH A DETERMINED EXPRESSION
AH WHAT A SPLENDID DEATH FOR A SEAMAN CAPTAIN NEMO THEN SAID
CONSEIL WAS EAGER TO ACCEPT AND THIS TIME THE CANADIAN PROVED PERFECTLY AMENABLE TO GOING WITH US
CAPTAIN NEMO DECIDED TO MAKE FOR THE OCEAN FLOOR BY SUBMERGING ON AN APPROPRIATELY GRADUAL DIAGONAL WITH THE HELP OF HIS SIDE FINS WHICH WERE SET AT A 45 DEGREES ANGLE TO THE NAUTILUS'S WATERLINE
BUT THIS FUTILE SEARCH COULDN'T DRAG ON MUCH LONGER
CALM DOWN MR LAND
SOME DAYS ASHORE 109 22
HE WAS LASHED AROUND THE WAIST TO WITHSTAND THE MONSTROUS BREAKERS FOAMING OVER THE DECK
THE WIND WAS BLOWING FROM THE SOUTHWEST INITIALLY A STIFF BREEZE IN OTHER WORDS WITH A SPEED OF FIFTEEN METERS PER SECOND WHICH BUILT TO TWENTY-FIVE METERS NEAR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
IT'S COMING TOWARD US
THE NAUTILUS CONTINUED TO WANDER AT RANDOM
IN STILL OTHER LOCALITIES SUCH AS RéUNION ISLAND AND THE ISLAND OF MAURITIUS THEY BUILD FRINGING REEFS HIGH STRAIGHT WALLS NEXT TO WHICH THE OCEAN'S DEPTH IS CONSIDERABLE
I STARED AT THE LUMINOUS RIPPLES BREAKING OVER MY HANDS SHIMMERING SHEETS SPATTERED WITH BLOTCHES OF BLUISH GRAY
ONE HOSE IS FOR THE ENTRANCE OF AIR TO BE INHALED THE OTHER FOR THE EXIT OF AIR TO BE EXHALED AND THE TONGUE CLOSES OFF THE FORMER OR THE LATTER DEPENDING ON THE BREATHER'S NEEDS
FOR MY PART I MADE NO ALLUSION TO HIS ESCAPE PLANS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO PUSH HIM INTO AN ATTEMPT THAT WAS CERTAIN TO MISFIRE
THEN MY EYES FOCUSED ON A HUGE WORLD MAP DISPLAYED ON THE TABLE AND I PUT MY FINGER ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE OUR JUST-DETERMINED LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE INTERSECTED
LITTLE BY LITTLE NED DEVELOPED A TASTE FOR CHATTING AND I LOVED HEARING THE TALES OF HIS ADVENTURES IN THE POLAR SEAS
NEAR FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE SUBMERSIBLE PICKED UP SPEED
BUT IT ISN'T ENOUGH JUST TO MOVE WE HAVE TO SEE WHERE WE'RE GOING
WAS IT SOMETHING OTHER THAN A MARITIME ACCIDENT THAT HAD DRAGGED THIS CRAFT UNDER THE WATERS
WILL YOU HELP ME FOR ONCE IN HIS LIFE THE POOR LAD DIDN'T ADDRESS ME IN THE THIRD PERSON THE CANADIAN AND I SAT HIM UP
TWENTY HORRIBLE FACES APPEARED
THIS FORCE IS ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY I EXCLAIMED IN SOME SURPRISE
THE FLOOR OF THIS IMMENSE VALLEY IS MADE PICTURESQUE BY MOUNTAINS THAT FURNISH THESE UNDERWATER DEPTHS WITH SCENIC VIEWS
BUT NIGHT FELL AND WRAPPED THE SURGING OCEAN IN ITS SHADOWS
THIS WAS THE SITUATION
FOR THE TIME BEING THEN WE HAD TO SET ASIDE ANY HOPE OF RETURNING TO EUROPEAN SEAS
THE GENTLENESS OF THE MAN'S GAZE THE GENEROSITY EXPRESSED IN HIS FACIAL FEATURES THE NOBILITY OF HIS BEARING ALL VANISHED FROM MY MEMORY
ITS SHEAVES OF CONDUCTING WIRE WERE INSULATED WITHIN A GUTTA-PERCHA COVERING WHICH WAS PROTECTED BY A PADDING OF TEXTILE MATERIAL ENCLOSED IN A METAL SHEATH
IT'S GOING BACK TOWARD EUROPE LET IT TAKE US THERE
IN THE TOP PART OF THIS ENORMOUS HEAD INSIDE BIG CAVITIES SEPARATED BY CARTILAGE YOU'LL FIND 300 TO 400 KILOGRAMS OF THAT VALUABLE OIL CALLED SPERMACETI THE SPERM WHALE IS AN AWKWARD ANIMAL MORE TADPOLE THAN FISH AS PROFESSOR FRéDOL HAS NOTED
CORRECT BUT UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS THE MAN HAS NO FREEDOM
IF IT WAS A CETACEAN IT EXCEEDED IN BULK ANY WHALE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED BY SCIENCE
THEN THE PALLBEARERS APPROACHED
FOR THE NEXT HOUR OUR FRIGATE KEPT UP THIS PACE WITHOUT GAINING A FATHOM
VIOLENT SQUALLS ASSAULTED US DURING THE DAYTIME
I COULD ALREADY FEEL A DEFINITE PAIN AROUND MY PELVIC GIRDLE
HE TOOK ME TO THE BOW AND THERE I FOUND NOT JUST A CABIN BUT AN ELEGANT STATEROOM WITH A BED A WASHSTAND AND VARIOUS OTHER FURNISHINGS
AN INTERMINABLE DEBATE THEN BROKE OUT BETWEEN BELIEVERS AND SKEPTICS IN THE SCHOLARLY SOCIETIES AND SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS
HE SEEMS TO MISS EVERYTHING THAT'S DENIED US
MUCH TO MY SURPRISE HE WENT BACK DOWN SOUTH AND RETURNED TO EUROPEAN SEAS
ALTHOUGH OUR CELL WAS LARGE WE OBVIOUSLY HAD USED UP MOST OF THE OXYGEN IT CONTAINED
AIR TANKS ABUNDANTLY CHARGED WERE PLACED ON OUR BACKS BUT THE ELECTRIC LAMPS WERE NOT IN READINESS
THIS STRUGGLE HAD LASTED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
I CAN'T SAY
THE NIGHT PASSED IN THIS WAY WITHOUT THE CREW EVER EMERGING FROM THEIR USUAL INERTIA
MY CHEF IS A SKILLFUL FOOD PROCESSOR WHO EXCELS AT PICKLING AND PRESERVING THESE VARIOUS EXHIBITS FROM THE OCEAN
WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES WE WOULD BE ON BOARD AND THERE I COULD BREATHE EASY AGAIN--BECAUSE MY TANK'S CURRENT AIR SUPPLY SEEMED TO BE QUITE LOW IN OXYGEN
MUCH TO MY SURPRISE IT INDICATED A DEPTH OF 360 METERS
THOSE TWO INSEPARABLE COMPANIONS HAD SLEPT SERENELY UTTERLY UNAWARE OF THE NAUTILUS'S FEAT
A GALLANT FLEMISH BOY WHOM I GENUINELY LIKED AND WHO RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT
COME ALONG THEN
FOR THE LADIES IT'S A JEWEL THEY CAN WEAR ON THEIR FINGERS NECKS AND EARS THAT'S OBLONG IN SHAPE GLASSY IN LUSTER AND FORMED FROM MOTHER-OF-PEARL
YES SURELY BUT I HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT
IN OTHER WORDS IT FILLED WITH LUMINESCENT MATTER SO INTENSE THAT AT FIRST I COULDN'T STAND THE BRIGHTNESS OF IT
BUT BEFORE ENTERING THE GULF OF MEXICO NEAR LATITUDE 44 DEGREES NORTH THIS CURRENT DIVIDES INTO TWO ARMS
WE'LL SAY COAL FROM THE SEAFLOOR IF YOU PREFER CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED
INFURIATED COMMANDER FARRAGUT KEPT TWISTING THE THICK TUFT OF HAIR THAT FLOURISHED BELOW HIS CHIN
FUCUS PLANTS AND CREEPERS WERE GROWING IN STIFF PERPENDICULAR LINES GOVERNED BY THE DENSITY OF THE ELEMENT THAT GENERATED THEM
NOT EVEN CAPTAIN NEMO
BUT WHILE OBSERVING THESE DIFFERENT SPECIMENS OF MARINE FAUNA I DIDN'T STOP EXAMINING THE LONG PLAINS OF ATLANTIS
BUT ALTHOUGH OF MODERATE DIMENSIONS THEY AT LEAST FURNISH A MEAT THAT'S HIGHLY PRIZED
I COULD CLEARLY MAKE OUT A HIGH MOUNTAIN CROWNING RAS MOHAMMED BETWEEN THE TWO GULFS
YET THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE OF WATER UNDER ITS KEEL SINCE THE AVERAGE DEPTH OF THESE SEAS IS 1,800 METERS
THIS AT LEAST IS THE THEORY OF MR CHARLES DARWIN WHO THUS EXPLAINS THE FORMATION OF ATOLLS--A THEORY SUPERIOR IN MY VIEW TO THE ONE THAT SAYS THESE MADREPORIC EDIFICES SIT ON THE SUMMITS OF MOUNTAINS OR VOLCANOES SUBMERGED A FEW FEET BELOW SEA LEVEL
NO IT WOULDN'T BE ADVISABLE REPLIED NEMO THE EMOTIONLESS
AND A FEW MINUTES LATER WE WERE FLOATING ON THE WAVES OF THE ATLANTIC
BUT WEREN'T THEIR FEARS EXAGGERATED YES AND NO PROFESSOR ARONNAX ANSWERED CAPTAIN NEMO WHO SEEMED TO KNOW HIS RED SEA BY HEART
BUT WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS REFUGE
BRISTLING WITH STINGS AND STREWN WITH NODULES IT SPORTS HIDEOUSLY IRREGULAR HORNS
WELL MR LAND THE COMMANDER ASKED DO YOU STILL ADVISE PUTTING MY LONGBOATS TO SEA NO SIR NED LAND REPLIED BECAUSE THAT BEAST WON'T BE CAUGHT AGAINST ITS WILL THEN WHAT SHOULD WE DO STOKE UP MORE STEAM SIR IF YOU CAN
I RENOUNCED TERRESTRIAL FOODS LONG AGO AND I'M NONE THE WORSE FOR IT
IT CHANGED ITS SETTING AND DECOR FOR THE MERE PLEASURE OF OUR EYES AND WE WERE CALLED UPON NOT SIMPLY TO CONTEMPLATE THE WORKS OF OUR CREATOR IN THE MIDST OF THE LIQUID ELEMENT BUT ALSO TO PROBE THE OCEAN'S MOST DAUNTING MYSTERIES
EVEN THOUGH THE SURFACE OF THE SEA HAS SOLIDIFIED INTO ICE ITS LOWER STRATA ARE STILL OPEN THANKS TO THAT DIVINE JUSTICE THAT PUTS THE MAXIMUM DENSITY OF SALT WATER ONE DEGREE ABOVE ITS FREEZING POINT
NEAR FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON WE SIGHTED CAPE RAS MOHAMMED TO THE NORTH
AS OFTEN AS THE SUN SWEPT OVER ITS DAILY ARC THE MASTS WERE POPULATED WITH SAILORS WHOSE FEET ITCHED AND COULDN'T HOLD STILL ON THE PLANKING OF THE DECK BELOW
THEY FORM A WHIRLPOOL APTLY CALLED THE OCEAN'S NAVEL WHOSE ATTRACTING POWER EXTENDS A DISTANCE OF FIFTEEN KILOMETERS
O ALMIGHTY GOD
OH HE EXCLAIMED
THE SEA WAS MAGNIFICENT THE SKIES CLEAR
FROM WHAT CAUSE
UNFORTUNATELY THIS BAY FORMS AN OPEN OFFSHORE MOORING THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEND
CARRIED AWAY BY ITS MOMENTUM THE SHIP SOMETIMES MOUNTED ON TOP OF THESE TRACTS OF ICE AND CRUSHED THEM WITH ITS WEIGHT OR AT OTHER TIMES WHEN COOPED UP BENEATH THE ICE FIELDS IT SPLIT THEM WITH SIMPLE PITCHING MOVEMENTS CREATING WIDE PUNCTURES
THE NAUTILUS'S GENERAL HEADING WAS SOUTHEAST AND IT STAYED AT A DEPTH BETWEEN 100 AND 150 METERS
THAT'S ONE ROUGH SEA NED LAND TOLD ME
ON FEBRUARY 6 THE NAUTILUS CRUISED IN SIGHT OF THE CITY OF ADEN PERCHED ON A PROMONTORY CONNECTED TO THE CONTINENT BY A NARROW ISTHMUS A SORT OF INACCESSIBLE GIBRALTAR WHOSE FORTIFICATIONS THE ENGLISH REBUILT AFTER CAPTURING IT IN 1839
WILL YOU BE READY SIR YES
THE ENTIRE SKY ALTHOUGH LIT UP BY STELLAR RADIATION SEEMED PITCH-BLACK IN COMPARISON WITH THE WHITENESS OF THESE WATERS
ONE USES FEWER BUNSEN CELLS BUT THEY'RE BIG AND STRONG AND EXPERIENCE HAS PROVEN THEIR SUPERIORITY
THADDEUS KOSCIUSKO THE HERO WHOSE DYING WORDS HAD BEEN FINIS POLONIAE MARKOS BOTZARIS FOR MODERN GREECE THE REINCARNATION OF SPARTA'S KING LEONIDAS
FURTHERMORE THIS NATIVE BOATMAN CLAIMED THAT DURING A STAY IN VANIKORO SIX YEARS EARLIER HE HAD SEEN TWO EUROPEANS BELONGING TO SHIPS THAT HAD RUN AGROUND ON THE ISLAND'S REEFS MANY YEARS BEFORE
NEVERTHELESS CONTRARY TO MY EXPECTATIONS THE NAUTILUS DEFINITELY BEGAN TO MOVE BACKWARD
CAPTAIN NEMO SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
THE EASE WITH WHICH I COULD MOVE INCREASED MY CONFIDENCE AND THE MANY STRANGE SIGHTS CAPTIVATED MY IMAGINATION
NOTHING NEW ON BOARD
A FEW WHIFFS OF AIR HAD ENTERED MY LUNGS
WITH A SWEEP OF THE AX CAPTAIN NEMO CHOPPED OFF THIS FEARSOME TENTACLE WHICH SLID WRITHING DOWN THE STEPS
AND AS FOR OTHER FISH COMMON TO THE ATLANTIC AND MEDITERRANEAN I WAS UNABLE TO OBSERVE MIRALETS TRIGGERFISH PUFFERS SEAHORSES JEWELFISH TRUMPETFISH BLENNIES GRAY MULLET WRASSE SMELT FLYING FISH ANCHOVIES SEA BREAM PORGIES GARFISH OR ANY OF THE CHIEF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ORDER PLEURONECTA SUCH AS SOLE FLOUNDER PLAICE DAB AND BRILL SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE DIZZYING SPEED WITH WHICH THE NAUTILUS HUSTLED THROUGH THESE OPULENT WATERS
IT'S GOING TO RELIVE ITS DAILY EXISTENCE
CAPTAIN NEMO KEPT HIS PROW POINTING SOUTH
THE WEATHER WAS THREATENING THE SEA ROUGH AND BILLOWY
MY MEMORIES TOOK WING TOWARD FRANCE IN THE WAKE OF THOSE ZODIACAL STARS DUE TO TWINKLE OVER IT IN A FEW HOURS
A MAJOR SEA NEARLY UNKNOWN TO THE ANCIENTS EXCEPT PERHAPS THE CARTHAGINIANS THOSE DUTCHMEN OF ANTIQUITY WHO WENT ALONG THE WEST COASTS OF EUROPE AND AFRICA ON THEIR COMMERCIAL JUNKETS
COVERED WITH HEAVY CLOUDS THE STORMY SKY GAVE ONLY THE FAINTEST LIGHT TO THE OCEAN'S UPPER STRATA
WALTER WITH THE PAINTINGS OF MILO WINTER CEDAR POST PUBLISHING HOUSTON TEXAS TEXT PREPARED BY
NATURALLY ENOUGH THE CANADIAN WANTED TO LAY IN A SUPPLY OF HONEY AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ILL-MANNERED OF ME TO SAY NO
AMONG OTHER SPECIMENS IN THESE TWO BRANCHES I NOTED SOME WINDOWPANE OYSTERS WITH THIN VALVES OF UNEQUAL SIZE A TYPE OF OSTRACOD UNIQUE TO THE RED SEA AND THE INDIAN OCEAN THEN ORANGE-HUED LUCINA WITH CIRCULAR SHELLS AWL-SHAPED AUGER SHELLS SOME OF THOSE PERSIAN MUREX SNAILS THAT SUPPLY THE NAUTILUS WITH SUCH WONDERFUL DYE SPIKY PERIWINKLES FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS LONG THAT ROSE UNDER THE WAVES LIKE HANDS READY TO GRAB YOU TURBAN SNAILS WITH SHELLS MADE OF HORN AND BRISTLING ALL OVER WITH SPINES LAMP SHELLS EDIBLE DUCK CLAMS THAT FEED THE HINDU MARKETPLACE SUBTLY LUMINOUS JELLYFISH OF THE SPECIES PELAGIA PANOPYRA AND FINALLY SOME WONDERFUL OCULINA FLABELLIFORMA MAGNIFICENT SEA FANS THAT FASHION ONE OF THE MOST LUXURIANT TREE FORMS IN THIS OCEAN
THE GENERAL EFFECT OF THESE SMOOTH ROCKS IS INDESCRIBABLE
BUT IN GRAPPLING WITH THEM WE HAD TO VENTURE UP DIFFICULT TRAILS THROUGH A HUGE THICKET
NOBODY SAID A WORD
ACTUAL PETRIFIED THICKETS AND LONG ALCOVES FROM SOME FANTASTIC SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE KEPT OPENING UP BEFORE OUR STEPS
BUT THEY SOON HAD TO SIDESTEP ITS THRUSTS
WHAT WAS IRRITATING THIS MOLLUSK
OUR RETURN JOURNEY BEGAN
IT'S A SALTY RIVER SALTIER THAN THE SEA SURROUNDING IT
HIS CHIEF OFFICER STRUGGLED FURIOUSLY WITH OTHER MONSTERS CRAWLING UP THE NAUTILUS'S SIDES
BY ANY CHANCE COULD THEY BE ELECTRIC TOO ELECTRIC OH YE GODS I'M HALF TEMPTED TO BELIEVE IT
ANYHOW IT LIT OUR WAY ALTHOUGH HAZILY BUT I SOON GREW ACCUSTOMED TO THIS UNIQUE GLOOM AND IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I UNDERSTOOD THE USELESSNESS OF THE RUHMKORFF DEVICE
WE RETURNED ON BOARD
IT WAS THIS CURRENT THE NAUTILUS WAS ABOUT TO CROSS
AS FOR THE CREW THEY ONLY WANTED TO ENCOUNTER THE UNICORN HARPOON IT HAUL IT ON BOARD AND CARVE IT UP
SPERM WHALES DON'T PREY ON THEIR WHALEBONE COUSINS
OPEN YOUR EYES REPEATED THE SAILORS OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
I'VE SEEN A MOLECULE OF SALT WATER HEAT UP AT THE SURFACE SINK INTO THE DEPTHS REACH MAXIMUM DENSITY AT 2 DEGREES CENTIGRADE THEN COOL OFF GROW LIGHTER AND RISE AGAIN
LIGHT MOVABLE READING STANDS WHICH COULD BE PUSHED AWAY OR PULLED NEAR AS DESIRED ALLOWED BOOKS TO BE POSITIONED ON THEM FOR EASY STUDY
WITHOUT THUNDERCLAPS LIGHTNING BOLTS WOULD BE MUCH LESS FRIGHTENING ALTHOUGH THE DANGER LIES IN THE FLASH NOT THE NOISE
I FINALLY UNDERSTOOD
THERE'S SOMETHING SERIOUS AFOOT CONSEIL SAID AND IT BODES WELL BAH REPLIED THE RANCOROUS HARPOONER
AT THE FAR END STOOD A FOURTH WATERTIGHT BULKHEAD SEPARATING THE CREW'S QUARTERS FROM THE ENGINE ROOM
IT'S NOT JUST ONE WHALE IT'S TEN TWENTY A WHOLE GAM
HIS COMPANION DID LIKEWISE
I FORCED HIM TO WAIT
WITH MASTER'S PERMISSION I'LL MAKE AN OBSERVATION TO HIM CONSEIL THEN TOLD ME
FORTUNATELY THIS SUBMERGING MOVEMENT STOPPED
JUST AS CONSEIL WAS ABOUT TO JUMP ASHORE I HELD HIM BACK
SO WOULD HE GO DOWN SOUTH
THE SUN'S RAYS HIT THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES AT A FAIRLY OBLIQUE ANGLE DECOMPOSING BY REFRACTION AS THOUGH PASSING THROUGH A PRISM
RED WITH BLOOD MOTIONLESS BY THE BEACON CAPTAIN NEMO STARED AT THE SEA THAT HAD SWALLOWED ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS AND LARGE TEARS STREAMED FROM HIS EYES
WE HAVE A COMMANDER WHO'S GAME FOR ANYTHING WHAT MASTER DOES I'LL DO CONSEIL REPLIED
BUT IN MY HUMBLE OPINION A LIFE IN JAIL IS A LIFE WITHOUT JOY FOR FOUR DAYS UNTIL FEBRUARY 3 THE NAUTILUS INSPECTED THE GULF OF OMAN AT VARIOUS SPEEDS AND DEPTHS
THE LOUNGE IS AT YOUR DISPOSAL AND WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'LL TAKE MY LEAVE CAPTAIN NEMO BOWED
WELL PROFESSOR ARE YOU PLEASED WITH THIS RED SEA
TO APPRECIATE SUCH A NUMBER WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT A QUINTILLION IS TO A BILLION WHAT A BILLION IS TO ONE IN OTHER WORDS THERE ARE AS MANY BILLIONS IN A QUINTILLION AS ONES IN A BILLION
I BOWED AND THE COMMANDER WENT ON
TWELVE MILES AWAY CAPE ST VINCENT WAS HAZILY VISIBLE THE SOUTHWESTERN TIP OF THE HISPANIC PENINSULA
THE STEAMING WATER WAS INJECTED INTO THE ICY WATER OUTSIDE AND AFTER THREE HOURS HAD PASSED THE THERMOMETER GAVE THE EXTERIOR TEMPERATURE AS 6 DEGREES CENTIGRADE
BESIDES ACCORDING TO THE CALCULATIONS OF NATURALISTS ONE OF THESE ANIMALS ONLY SIX FEET LONG WOULD HAVE TENTACLES AS LONG AS TWENTY-SEVEN
BY THEN THE STORM HAD REACHED ITS MAXIMUM INTENSITY
AND NOW HE RESTS BESIDE HIS COMPANIONS IN THAT CORAL CEMETERY YES FORGOTTEN BY THE WORLD BUT NOT BY US
AT THIS LOCALITY WE STOOD IN THE CENTER OF A HUGE CLEARING SURROUNDED BY THE TALL TREE FORMS OF THIS UNDERWATER FOREST
THEY HAVE QUITE ENOUGH NATURAL ENEMIES SUCH AS SPERM WHALES SWORDFISH AND SAWFISH WITHOUT YOU MEDDLING WITH THEM I'LL LET THE READER DECIDE WHAT FACES THE CANADIAN MADE DURING THIS LECTURE ON HUNTING ETHICS
LOOK HOW HIGH ITS BLOWHOLES ARE SPOUTING ALL THAT AIR AND STEAM
JUST THIS
JUST THIS
STRIKING AN AVERAGE OF OBSERVATIONS TAKEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES REJECTING THOSE TIMID ESTIMATES THAT GAVE THE OBJECT A LENGTH OF 200 FEET AND IGNORING THOSE EXAGGERATED VIEWS THAT SAW IT AS A MILE WIDE AND THREE LONG--YOU COULD STILL ASSERT THAT THIS PHENOMENAL CREATURE GREATLY EXCEEDED THE DIMENSIONS OF ANYTHING THEN KNOWN TO ICHTHYOLOGISTS IF IT EXISTED AT ALL
LUCKILY AND MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE CONSEIL PULLED OFF A RIGHT-AND-LEFT SHOT AND INSURED OUR BREAKFAST
THEN MY MIND GREW CALMER MY IMAGINATION MELTED INTO HAZY DROWSINESS AND I SOON FELL INTO AN UNEASY SLUMBER
THE LATTER RETURNED FROM TIME TO TIME TO BREATHE AT THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
ALL IN ALL IT'S ESTIMATED THAT IF THE SEA BOTTOM WERE MADE LEVEL ITS AVERAGE DEPTH WOULD BE ABOUT SEVEN KILOMETERS WELL PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED WE'LL SHOW YOU BETTER THAN THAT I HOPE
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED SINCE THE BALLAST TANKS AREN'T YET EMPTY AND WHEN THEY ARE THE NAUTILUS MUST RISE TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA THE CAPTAIN WENT OUT AND SOON I SAW THAT AT HIS ORDERS THE NAUTILUS HAD HALTED ITS UPWARD MOVEMENT
AND UTTERLY EXHAUSTED FAINT FROM LACK OF FOOD AND REST I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM FULL OF WONDER AT THIS STARTLING EXCURSION ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
CHAPTER 3 AS MASTER WISHES THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J
SLIP IT UNDER YOUR BELT AND LET'S BE OFF I STARED AT MY COMPANIONS
IT SLAYS INSECTS BY SHOOTING THEM WITH A SIMPLE DROP OF WATER
THE STRAIT THAT LUIS VAEZ DE TORRES FACED ON RETURNING FROM THE SOUTH SEAS IN MELANESIA THE STRAIT IN WHICH SLOOPS OF WAR UNDER CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE RAN AGROUND IN 1840 AND NEARLY MISCARRIED WITH ALL HANDS
WHO KNOWS
GRILLING OVER THE COALS THOSE CUTLETS FROM THE BARI-OUTANG SOON GAVE OFF A SUCCULENT AROMA THAT PERFUMED THE AIR
ONE DAY PERHAPS SOME VOLCANIC PHENOMENON WILL BRING THESE SUNKEN RUINS BACK TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
AND FOR A MAN WHO DIDN'T MISS HIS PAST EXISTENCE ON LAND FOR A CAPTAIN NEMO WHO WAS AT HOME HERE WHO WENT WHERE HE WISHED WHO TOOK PATHS MYSTERIOUS TO OTHERS IF NOT HIMSELF IN ATTAINING HIS ENDS I COULD UNDERSTAND SUCH A LIFE
BUT AS UNEMOTIONAL AS HE WAS HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE IMPECCABLY EMOTIONLESS THAN CONSEIL WHEN I TOLD THE FINE LAD OUR INTENTION OF PUSHING ON TO THE SOUTH POLE
FROM THE HEART OF THE WATERS
I WENT THROUGH THE OPENING THAT HAD ALREADY GIVEN ACCESS TO MY TWO COMPANIONS
I DRESSED HURRIEDLY AND ENTERED THE MAIN LOUNGE
PERHAPS I WOULD NEVER LEARN WHO HE WAS WHERE HE CAME FROM OR WHERE HE WAS HEADING BUT MORE AND MORE I COULD SEE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE MAN AND THE SCIENTIST
SO THE SECRET OF HIS EXISTENCE MIGHT SOMEDAY BE UNVEILED
MEANWHILE PREPARATIONS FOR THIS DARING ATTEMPT WERE GETTING UNDER WAY
THE OARS MAST AND SAIL ARE IN THE SKIFF
BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY YOU'RE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE FIRST USE I'VE FOUND FOR THIS VALUABLE FORCE
I MISSED IT NO I SAID THE ANIMAL'S WOUNDED THERE'S ITS BLOOD
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK IMPOSSIBLE TO REPLY
THE ISLANDERS WERE STILL THERE IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN ON THE DAY BEFORE PERHAPS 500 OR 600 OF THEM
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS ASSUMED THE EXISTENCE OF A NEW WORLD
PERHAPS THEY WOULDN'T SUFFICIENTLY INCREASE THE NAUTILUS'S SPECIFIC GRAVITY
THEN HIS HAND SIGNALED ME TO FOLLOW HIM
IN ANY EVENT THE NAUTILUS WAS GOING TO TRY
FOLLOW ME I TOLD MY TWO COMPANIONS
WHY WERE WE IMPRISONED BEHIND THESE MASKS OF METAL AND GLASS
YOU AND YOUR CAPTAIN NEMO I PITY YOU BOTH BUT WE WILL GO TO THE POLE MR LAND MAYBE BUT YOU WON'T COME BACK AND NED LAND REENTERED HIS CABIN TO KEEP FROM DOING SOMETHING DESPERATE HE SAID AS HE LEFT ME
SO I DIDN'T ALLUDE TO THIS EVENT WHEN THAT EVENING I CHANCED TO BE ALONE WITH THE CAPTAIN IN THE LOUNGE
I'M GOING TO MAKE ANOTHER UNDERWATER TOUR OF THE WORLD PERHAPS MY LAST WHO KNOWS?--AND I'LL REVIEW EVERYTHING I'VE STUDIED IN THE DEPTHS OF THESE SEAS THAT I'VE CROSSED SO OFTEN AND YOU CAN BE MY FELLOW STUDENT
DURING THE COURSE OF THE NEXT DAY APRIL 12 THE NAUTILUS DREW NEAR THE COAST OF DUTCH GUIANA BY THE MOUTH OF THE MARONI RIVER
OUR GLOBE BEGAN WITH THE SEA SO TO SPEAK AND WHO CAN SAY WE WON'T END WITH IT
AND INSTEAD OF HEADING BACK TO THE NAUTILUS CAPTAIN NEMO CONTINUED HIS DARING EXCURSION
THE LATTER WENT OUT
SEVERAL THOUSAND KILOS OF MEAT WERE HAULED BELOW TO BE DRIED AND STORED
I COULDN'T STOP MARVELING AT THESE ANIMALS SO PERFECTLY CUT OUT FOR RACING THEIR HEADS SMALL THEIR BODIES SLEEK SPINDLE-SHAPED AND IN SOME CASES OVER THREE METERS LONG THEIR PECTORAL FINS GIFTED WITH REMARKABLE STRENGTH THEIR CAUDAL FINS FORKED
LOOK THE PANELS HAD OPENED AND I COULD SEE A COMPLETELY WHITE SEA AROUND THE NAUTILUS
TREES WITHOUT LEAVES WITHOUT SAP TURNED TO STONE BY THE ACTION OF THE WATERS AND CROWNED HERE AND THERE BY GIGANTIC PINES
PEOPLE WERE CONSTANTLY BABBLING ABOUT THE CREATURE EVEN VIA THE ATLANTIC CABLE
THERE'S ALSO THE STORY OF HOW THE BISHOP OF TRONDHEIM SET UP AN ALTAR ONE DAY ON AN IMMENSE ROCK
I DON'T IMAGINE YOU'RE WORRIED THAT THESE GENTLEMEN WILL STAVE IN WALLS THAT SHELLS FROM YOUR FRIGATE COULDN'T BREACH NO CAPTAIN BUT ONE DANGER STILL REMAINS WHAT'S THAT SIR TOMORROW AT ABOUT THIS TIME WE'LL NEED TO REOPEN THE HATCHES TO RENEW THE NAUTILUS'S AIR NO ARGUMENT SIR SINCE OUR CRAFT BREATHES IN THE MANNER FAVORED BY CETACEANS BUT IF THESE PAPUANS ARE OCCUPYING THE PLATFORM AT THAT MOMENT I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN PREVENT THEM FROM ENTERING THEN SIR YOU ASSUME THEY'LL BOARD THE SHIP I'M CERTAIN OF IT WELL SIR LET THEM COME ABOARD
HIS HEART MUST HAVE BEEN THROBBING WITH INTENSE EXCITEMENT
AND IN LATITUDE 32 DEGREES 40 NORTH AND LONGITUDE 167 DEGREES 50 WEST I FOUND AN ISLET THAT HAD BEEN DISCOVERED IN 1801 BY CAPTAIN CRESPO WHICH OLD SPANISH CHARTS CALLED ROCCA DE LA PLATA IN OTHER WORDS SILVER ROCK SO WE WERE ABOUT 1,800 MILES FROM OUR STARTING POINT AND BY A SLIGHT CHANGE OF HEADING THE NAUTILUS WAS BRINGING US BACK TOWARD THE SOUTHEAST
I'LL LET THE READER DECIDE HOW THIS NEWS WAS RECEIVED BY THE CANADIAN
BUT IN THE WATER IT'S ANOTHER STORY YES I SEE NED REPLIED GROWING MORE INTERESTED
IT'S APPROACHING
THE BLACKISH BACK SUPPORTING ME WAS SMOOTH AND POLISHED WITH NO OVERLAPPING SCALES
WHAT WAS CAPTAIN NEMO THINKING
THEN DROPPING NED AND TURNING TO THE BATTLESHIP WHOSE SHELLS WERE SHOWERING AROUND HIM
THE SEA ABSORBING EVERY COLOR OF THE PRISM EXCEPT ITS BLUE RAYS REFLECTED THE LATTER IN EVERY DIRECTION AND SPORTED A WONDERFUL INDIGO TINT
ABOVE THE DOOR OPENED AN AIR VENT THAT LET IN A FRESH CURRENT OF OXYGEN RENEWING THE THIN AIR IN OUR CELL
I COULD ONLY THANK MY HOST
FINALLY AS A LAST RESORT I HAULED OUT EVERYTHING I COULD REMEMBER FROM MY EARLY SCHOOLDAYS AND I TRIED TO NARRATE OUR ADVENTURES IN LATIN
NOW'S MY CHANCE TO HUNT LIONS AND TIGERS BUT IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT SHARKS IN THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK IT OVER BEFORE ACCEPTING
WHATEVER MOTIVES HAD DRIVEN HIM TO SEEK INDEPENDENCE UNDER THE SEAS HE REMAINED A HUMAN BEING BEFORE ALL ELSE
THESE POLYPS HAVE A UNIQUE GENERATING MECHANISM THAT REPRODUCES THEM VIA THE BUDDING PROCESS AND THEY HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE WHILE ALSO PARTICIPATING IN A COMMUNAL LIFE
IN FACT WATER IS A BETTER CONDUCTOR OF SOUND THAN AIR AND UNDER THE WAVES NOISES CARRY FOUR TIMES AS FAST
THE ELECTRIC CELLS YOU USE TO GENERATE THIS MARVELOUS FORCE MUST BE DEPLETED VERY QUICKLY
UNDER THIS POWERFUL THRUST THE NAUTILUS'S HULL QUIVERED LIKE A RESONATING CHORD AND THE SHIP SANK STEADILY UNDER THE WATERS
OFTEN WE COULD CHART OUR COURSE ONLY BY GUESSWORK A LESS THAN SATISFACTORY METHOD IN THE MIDST OF THESE WINDING PASSAGEWAYS WHOSE LANDMARKS CHANGE CONTINUOUSLY
THIS BREAD WAS EXCELLENT I MUST ADMIT AND I ATE IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE
NOW WE'VE GOT THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES
FROM THEIR SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS THEY WERE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE MAMMAL'S MINIMUM LENGTH AT MORE THAN 350 ENGLISH FEET THIS WAS BECAUSE BOTH THE SHANNON AND THE HELVETIA WERE OF SMALLER DIMENSIONS ALTHOUGH EACH MEASURED 100 METERS STEM TO STERN
IN THIS WAY ANIMAL LIFE DEVELOPED AND DRAWN BY THE GREENERY AND FERTILE SOIL MAN APPEARED
AH PROFESSOR HE SAID IN AN AFFABLE TONE I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU
WHAT BLOODSHED
IN THIS LANTERN ONE FINDS A GLASS SPIRAL THAT CONTAINS ONLY A RESIDUE OF CARBON DIOXIDE GAS
THIS DUGONG--WHICH ALSO BOASTS THE NAME HALICORE--CLOSELY RESEMBLED A MANATEE
HERE UNDER THESE CLEAR WAVES THIS CRAB RACED AROUND WITH MATCHLESS AGILITY WHILE GREEN TURTLES FROM THE SPECIES FREQUENTING THE MALABAR COAST MOVED SLUGGISHLY AMONG THE CRUMBLING ROCKS
MY FIRST CONCERN WAS TO LOOK FOR THE FRIGATE
I COULDN'T SAY COULD BARELY EVEN IMAGINE
WHEN WE WERE IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY'S SEAS YOU DIDN'T SAY A WORD
BECAUSE FRANKLY IT TASTED LIKE LEATHER
ABREAST OF THE WEST INDIES THIS VALLEY FORKS INTO TWO ARMS AND TO THE NORTH IT ENDS IN AN ENORMOUS DEPRESSION 9,000 METERS DEEP
FOR SHIPS A MERE REEF FOR US AN IMMENSE CAVERN
AMONG THE BOOKS THAT MAKE UP MY FAVORITE READING YOU'LL FIND THE WORK YOU'VE PUBLISHED ON THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS
WELL THAT NECKLACE COST ME ONLY $1.50 BUT YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY TRUST ME ON THIS PROFESSOR ITS PEARLS WERE SO BIG THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GONE THROUGH THAT STRAINER WITH TWENTY HOLES MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED LAUGHING THOSE WERE ARTIFICIAL PEARLS ORDINARY GLASS BEADS WHOSE INSIDES WERE COATED WITH ESSENCE OF ORIENT WOW THE CANADIAN REPLIED
NORTH OF US
SOME OF THESE MASSES DISPLAYED GREEN VEINS AS IF SCRAWLED WITH UNDULATING LINES OF COPPER SULFATE
ARRIVING WITHIN A FEW CABLE LENGTHS OF THE CETACEAN OUR LONGBOAT SLOWED DOWN AND THE SCULLS DIPPED NOISELESSLY INTO THE TRANQUIL WATERS
BUT THE DOOR WAS CLOSED AND I COULDN'T SEE ITS ACCOMMODATIONS WHICH MIGHT HAVE TOLD ME THE NUMBER OF MEN IT TOOK TO OPERATE THE NAUTILUS
NED LAND HE CALLED
THEN IT SOMERSAULTS IT TURNS COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN
WOULD A SUDDEN OUTBURST OF VOICES TELL ME THAT NED LAND'S ESCAPE PLANS HAD JUST BEEN DETECTED
HIS SPECIFICATIONS FOR AN OPEN-SEA SUBMARINE AND A SELF-CONTAINED DIVING SUIT WERE DECADES BEFORE THEIR TIME YET MODERN TECHNOLOGY BEARS THEM OUT TRIUMPHANTLY
WAS IT SOME SORT OF ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE
BUT IN OUR CASE ALL WE COULD DO WAS FIRE AT THEM ON THE WING WHICH LEFT US LITTLE CHANCE OF GETTING ONE
GLOBEFISH GENUINE PORCUPINES OF THE SEA ARMED WITH STINGS AND ABLE TO INFLATE THEMSELVES UNTIL THEY LOOK LIKE A PIN CUSHION BRISTLING WITH NEEDLES
BE SEATED HE TOLD ME AND EAT LIKE THE FAMISHED MAN YOU MUST BE OUR BREAKFAST CONSISTED OF SEVERAL DISHES WHOSE CONTENTS WERE ALL SUPPLIED BY THE SEA AND SOME FOODS WHOSE NATURE AND DERIVATION WERE UNKNOWN TO ME
IT WAS A HIGH-SPEED FRIGATE FURNISHED WITH SUPERHEATING EQUIPMENT THAT ALLOWED THE TENSION OF ITS STEAM TO BUILD TO SEVEN ATMOSPHERES
NEXT NATURAL TOWERS WITH WIDE STEEPLY CARVED BATTLEMENTS LEANED AT ANGLES THAT ON DRY LAND THE LAWS OF GRAVITY WOULD NEVER HAVE AUTHORIZED
THIS NEW SEARCH AFTER PUTTING IN AT SEVERAL STOPS OVER THE PACIFIC DROPPED ANCHOR BEFORE VANIKORO ON JULY 7 1827 IN THE SAME HARBOR OF VANA WHERE THE NAUTILUS WAS CURRENTLY FLOATING
GIFTED WITH UNCOMMON MANUAL ABILITY NED LAND WAS A CANADIAN WHO HAD NO EQUAL IN HIS DANGEROUS TRADE
JUST AS WE WERE CROWDING EACH OTHER TO REACH THE PLATFORM TWO MORE ARMS LASHED THE AIR SWOOPED ON THE SEAMAN STATIONED IN FRONT OF CAPTAIN NEMO AND CARRIED THE FELLOW AWAY WITH IRRESISTIBLE VIOLENCE
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF OPEN SEA WASHES THE POLE WE'LL GO TO THAT VERY PLACE RIGHT I SAID CARRIED AWAY BY THE CAPTAIN'S LOGIC
THE LOG INDICATED A MODERATE SPEED THE PRESSURE GAUGE A DEPTH OF ABOUT SIXTY FEET
THIS GROUP IS CHIEFLY MADE UP OF NINE LARGE ISLANDS AND FORMS A 120-LEAGUE STRIP FROM THE NORTH-NORTHWEST TO THE SOUTH-SOUTHEAST LYING BETWEEN LATITUDE 2 DEGREES AND 15 DEGREES SOUTH AND BETWEEN LONGITUDE 164 DEGREES AND 168 DEGREES
I FOLLOWED HIM WITH MY EYES
NEVERTHELESS HE DECIDED TO START ON DILLON'S TRAIL
YOUR COMING HAS DISRUPTED MY WHOLE EXISTENCE UNINTENTIONALLY I SAID
ADMIRAL DE CHATEAU-RENAULT WAS SO INDECISIVE AS TO OBEY THIS DIRECTIVE AND THE GALLEONS ENTERED THE BAY OF VIGO
THE ENORMOUS HEAD OF THIS CETACEAN OCCUPIES ABOUT A THIRD OF ITS BODY
I TOLD CONSEIL THAT SPONGES ARE FISHED UP IN TWO WAYS EITHER BY DRAGNET OR BY HAND
THE SHEET-IRON PANELS SLID SHUT
WAS IT UNINTENTIONALLY THAT MR NED LAND HIT ME WITH HIS HARPOON I DETECTED A CONTROLLED IRRITATION IN THESE WORDS
AT LEAST I HOPE IT WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE
WAS HE A HERO OF THAT DREADFUL CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA A WAR LAMENTABLE YET FOREVER GLORIOUS
BUT I'M TEMPTED TO THINK THAT THE COMMANDER AND HIS CHIEF OFFICER WERE BORN IN THE LOW LATITUDES
YE GODS CONSEIL SAID IT'S FORTUNATE THAT NED LAND DIDN'T COME WITH US WHY SO CONSEIL BECAUSE THAT MADCAP HUNTER WOULD KILL EVERY ANIMAL HERE EVERY ANIMAL MAY BE OVERSTATING IT BUT IN TRUTH I DOUBT WE COULD KEEP OUR CANADIAN FRIEND FROM HARPOONING SOME OF THESE MAGNIFICENT CETACEANS
WE NEED SOME FRUIT TO GO WITH IT OR AT LEAST SOME VEGETABLES THEN LET'S LOOK FOR FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WHEN OUR BREADFRUIT HARVESTING WAS DONE WE TOOK TO THE TRAIL TO COMPLETE THIS DRY-LAND DINNER WE DIDN'T SEARCH IN VAIN AND NEAR NOONTIME WE HAD AN AMPLE SUPPLY OF BANANAS
AND IN SOME REMOTE EPOCH BUILT UP BY VOLCANIC DISGORGINGS AND SUCCESSIVE LAYERS OF LAVA WHO KNOWS WHETHER THE PEAKS OF THESE FIRE-BELCHING MOUNTAINS MAY REAPPEAR ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE ATLANTIC
THE PROPELLER CHURNED THE WAVES WITH MATHEMATICAL REGULARITY SOMETIMES EMERGING ABOVE THE SURFACE AND THROWING PHOSPHORESCENT SPRAY TO GREAT HEIGHTS
SOON A GENTLE ROLLING TOLD ME THAT WE WERE AFLOAT IN THE OPEN AIR
NOW THEN THE NAUTILUS HAS A BURDEN OF 1,500 METRIC TONS
LONG HORIZONTAL PISTONS GROANED AND PUSHED THE TIE RODS OF THE DRIVE SHAFT
SOMETIMES THEY SET SNARES ON THE TOPS OF THE TALL TREES THAT THE BIRD OF PARADISE PREFERS TO INHABIT
BUT CAPTAIN NEMO DIDN'T WANT THESE GALLANT GENTLEMEN WASTING THEIR TIME AND ENERGY SO HE ENDED THE HUNT BY DIVING BENEATH THE WATERS
ABOMINABLE NED MY FRIEND CONSEIL REPLIED
WE AGREED TO WAIT FOR THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES NED LAND WENT ON
WHEN MASTER HAS TOLD ME THESE ANIMALS NAMES THEY'RE SEALS AND WALRUSES TWO GENERA OUR SCHOLARLY CONSEIL HASTENED TO SAY THAT BELONG TO THE FAMILY PINNIPEDIA ORDER CARNIVORA GROUP UNGUICULATA SUBCLASS MONODELPHIA CLASS MAMMALIA BRANCH VERTEBRATA VERY NICE CONSEIL I REPLIED BUT THESE TWO GENERA OF SEALS AND WALRUSES ARE EACH DIVIDED INTO SPECIES AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN WE NOW HAVE A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THEM
I ACCEPT YOUR CALCULATIONS CAPTAIN I REPLIED AND I'D BE ILL-MANNERED TO DISPUTE THEM SINCE YOUR DAILY EXPERIENCE BEARS THEM OUT
SOME PROMISING OPPORTUNITY MIGHT COME UP AND I DON'T SEE WHAT COULD STOP US FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT
QUESTIONING THE NATIVES CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE ALSO LEARNED THAT AFTER LA PéROUSE'S TWO SHIPS HAD MISCARRIED ON THE ISLAND'S REEFS THE COUNT HAD BUILT A SMALLER CRAFT ONLY TO GO OFF AND MISCARRY A SECOND TIME
THERE ARE CERTAIN FULTON-STYLE GUNS PERFECTED BY THE ENGLISHMEN PHILIPPE-COLES AND BURLEY THE FRENCHMAN FURCY AND THE ITALIAN LANDI
SEMIRED WRASSE SPORTING SCALES ONLY AT THE BASES OF THEIR DORSAL AND ANAL FINS
BY SUNRISE WE WERE OFF
WE'VE ESCAPED BEING CRUSHED
BUT IF WE COULDN'T ATTAIN OUR END THROUGH FORCE OR CUNNING I LIKED TO THINK WE MIGHT ACHIEVE IT THROUGH PERSUASION
FROM THE DAILY NOTES KEPT BY MR CONSEIL I ALSO RETRIEVE CERTAIN FISH FROM THE GENUS TETRADON UNIQUE TO THESE SEAS
ON DECEMBER 1 IT CUT THE EQUATOR AT LONGITUDE 142 DEGREES AND ON THE 4TH OF THE SAME MONTH AFTER A QUICK CROSSING MARKED BY NO INCIDENT WE RAISED THE MARQUESAS ISLANDS
IT THEN OCCURRED TO ME THAT THESE WORDS EITHER REFERRED TO THE STATE OF THE SEA OR THAT THEY MEANT
IRON UTENSILS ANCHORS EYELETS FROM PULLEYS SWIVEL GUNS AN EIGHTEEN-POUND SHELL THE REMAINS OF SOME ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS A PIECE OF STERNRAIL AND A BRONZE BELL BEARING THE INSCRIPTION MADE BY BAZIN THE FOUNDRY MARK AT BREST ARSENAL AROUND 1785
GOING AROUND THE OPPOSITE WAY CONSEIL MET UP WITH ME AND WE RETURNED TO THE MIDDLE OF THIS CABIN WHICH HAD TO BE TWENTY FEET LONG BY TEN WIDE
I INFORMED HIM THAT THEY WERE MADE FROM THE SMOOTH SILKEN FILAMENTS WITH WHICH THE FAN MUSSEL A TYPE OF SEASHELL QUITE ABUNDANT ALONG MEDITERRANEAN BEACHES ATTACHES ITSELF TO ROCKS
THESE BEARINGS DETERMINED THE FRIGATE TOOK A MORE DECISIVE WESTWARD HEADING AND TACKLED THE SEAS OF THE CENTRAL PACIFIC
UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS SOME TEN MEN AT THE MOST SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO OPERATE IT ALL RIGHT THE CANADIAN SAID THEN WHY SHOULD THERE BE ANY MORE THAN THAT WHY I ANSWERED
BUT THE CANADIAN LOOKING RATHER WORRIED FOLLOWED ME
I'VE HEARD OF YOU PROFESSOR ARONNAX
THEN SOME WONDERFUL PEPPERY-FURROW SHELLS
SO IN OUR SWIFT CRUISE THROUGH THESE DEEP STRATA HOW MANY VESSELS I SAW LYING ON THE SEAFLOOR SOME ALREADY CAKED WITH CORAL OTHERS CLAD ONLY IN A LAYER OF RUST PLUS ANCHORS CANNONS SHELLS IRON FITTINGS PROPELLER BLADES PARTS OF ENGINES CRACKED CYLINDERS STAVED-IN BOILERS THEN HULLS FLOATING IN MIDWATER HERE UPRIGHT THERE OVERTURNED
A GENUINE KALEIDOSCOPE OF RED GREEN YELLOW ORANGE VIOLET INDIGO AND BLUE
BEFORE MY EYES THERE QUIVERED A HORRIBLE MONSTER WORTHY OF A PLACE AMONG THE MOST FARFETCHED TERATOLOGICAL LEGENDS
HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO FINISH OFF THE CLASS CRUSTACEA THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF ITS STOMATOPODS AMPHIPODS HOMOPODS ISOPODS TRILOBITES BRANCHIOPODS OSTRACODS AND ENTOMOSTRACEANS
COULD WE BREAK THROUGH IT
INCREASE ITS DIMENSIONS FIVEFOLD OR EVEN TENFOLD THEN GIVE THIS CETACEAN A STRENGTH IN PROPORTION TO ITS SIZE WHILE ENLARGING ITS OFFENSIVE WEAPONS AND YOU HAVE THE ANIMAL WE'RE LOOKING FOR
THE NOTE WAS WORDED AS FOLLOWS
NED LAND WAS CONTENT TO SHARPEN HIS HARPOON A DREADFUL WEAPON IN HIS HANDS
BUT THIS ROPE MEASURED NO MORE THAN ABOUT TEN FATHOMS AND ITS END HAD SIMPLY BEEN FASTENED TO A SMALL BARREL THAT WHILE FLOATING WOULD INDICATE THE DUGONG'S MOVEMENTS BENEATH THE WATERS
CAPTAIN NEMO WAS INSIDE
WHY WERE WE FORBIDDEN TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER
IN THIS LOCALITY THERE GAPED THE MOUTH OF A MAGNIFICENT CAVE
ONCE THE BIRDS HAVE MIGRATED NORTHWARD TO ESCAPE THE COLD THESE MARINE MAMMALS REMAIN AS SOLE LORDS OF THE POLAR CONTINENT
UNTIL NOW IT'S THE BOWHEAD WHALE YOU'VE HUNTED AND IT WON'T RISK GOING PAST THE WARM WATERS OF THE EQUATOR OH PROFESSOR WHAT ARE YOU FEEDING ME THE CANADIAN ANSWERED IN A TOLERABLY SKEPTICAL TONE
I'LL SEE HIM TODAY I ANSWERED THE CANADIAN WHO IF HE TOOK ACTION HIMSELF WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE RUINED EVERYTHING
FOR THE TIME BEING NED LAND WAS CONTENT TO CHOP THESE TRUNKS INTO PIECES AS IF HE WERE MAKING FIREWOOD
DID WE STRIKE BOTTOM I ASKED
JUST THEN CAPTAIN NEMO TURNED TO ME
THE ANCIENTS WELL UNDERSTOOD THE USEFULNESS TO COMMERCE OF CONNECTING THE RED SEA WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN BUT THEY NEVER DREAMED OF CUTTING A CANAL BETWEEN THE TWO AND INSTEAD THEY PICKED THE NILE AS THEIR LINK
WE HAVEN'T A MOMENT TO LOSE
A SMALL CYLINDRICAL TRUNK ADORNED WITH VERTICAL LINES MOTTLED WITH RED SPOTS AND CROWNED BY A WONDROUS BLOSSOMING OF TENTACLES
NEARLY SEVEN MONTHS HAD GONE BY WITHOUT OUR HAVING ANY NEWS FROM SHORE
I ARRIVED ON THE PLATFORM
MEANWHILE THE GRAVE DIGGING WENT SLOWLY
AND IF IT'S TRUE THAT THE ENGINEER HAS MORE CONFIDENCE IN A CRAFT THAN THE BUILDER AND THE BUILDER MORE THAN THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE UTTER ABANDON WITH WHICH I PLACE MY TRUST IN THIS NAUTILUS SINCE I'M ITS CAPTAIN BUILDER AND ENGINEER ALL IN ONE CAPTAIN NEMO SPOKE WITH WINNING ELOQUENCE
TIMOR ISLAND WAS VISIBLE FOR BARELY AN INSTANT AT NOON WHILE THE CHIEF OFFICER DETERMINED HIS POSITION
SEVENTY-FOUR YEARS AGO TO THE DAY AT THIS VERY SPOT IN LATITUDE 47 DEGREES 24 AND LONGITUDE 17 DEGREES 28 THIS SHIP SANK AFTER A HEROIC BATTLE
YOU'D SERIOUSLY CONSIDER TAKING OVER THIS CRAFT VERY SERIOUSLY THE CANADIAN REPLIED
IF WE CAN STAY ATTACHED TO THE NAUTILUS WE CAN STILL MAKE IT HE HADN'T FINISHED SPEAKING WHEN A CRACKING SOUND OCCURRED
THE CREW BATTLED WITH FLAILING AXES
AMONG THE ARTICULATES THERE WERE ANNELID WORMS ONE AND A HALF METERS LONG FURNISHED WITH A PINK PROBOSCIS EQUIPPED WITH 1,700 ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION SNAKING THROUGH THE WATERS AND AS THEY WENT THROWING OFF EVERY GLEAM IN THE SOLAR SPECTRUM
I'LL SHOW YOU MINE AND IN THE BOW OF THE PLATFORM CAPTAIN NEMO UNFURLED A BLACK FLAG LIKE THE ONE HE HAD LEFT PLANTED AT THE SOUTH POLE
ONCE WE'RE ON SOLID GROUND WE'LL FIGURE OUT A COURSE OF ACTION
MEAT HE KEPT REPEATING
WHEN I BURN THIS COMBUSTIBLE TO PRODUCE SODIUM THE SMOKE ESCAPING FROM THE MOUNTAIN'S CRATER GIVES IT THE APPEARANCE OF A STILL-ACTIVE VOLCANO AND WILL WE SEE YOUR COMPANIONS AT WORK NO AT LEAST NOT THIS TIME BECAUSE I'M EAGER TO CONTINUE OUR UNDERWATER TOUR OF THE WORLD
FORMERLY IN PREHISTORIC DAYS LAND ANIMALS QUADRUPEDS APES REPTILES BIRDS WERE BUILT ON A GIGANTIC SCALE
DO YOU KNOW YOUR SPANISH HISTORY EVEN IF HE KNEW IT BY HEART A MAN IN MY DISTURBED BEFUDDLED CONDITION COULDN'T HAVE QUOTED A SYLLABLE OF HIS OWN COUNTRY'S HISTORY
IT WAS NO ORDINARY MISANTHROPY THAT KEPT CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS COMPANIONS SEQUESTERED INSIDE THE NAUTILUS'S PLATING BUT A HATE SO MONSTROUS OR SO SUBLIME THAT THE PASSING YEARS COULD NEVER WEAKEN IT
IT GOES DOWN SOUTH SKIRTS EQUATORIAL AFRICA WARMS ITS WAVES IN THE RAYS OF THE TORRID ZONE CROSSES THE ATLANTIC REACHES CAPE SãO ROQUE ON THE COAST OF BRAZIL AND FORKS INTO TWO BRANCHES ONE GOING TO THE CARIBBEAN SEA FOR FURTHER SATURATION WITH HEAT PARTICLES
I ALSO NOTED LONG WHITISH STRINGS OF SALPS A TYPE OF MOLLUSK FOUND IN CLUSTERS AND SOME JELLYFISH OF LARGE SIZE THAT SWAYED IN THE EDDIES OF THE BILLOWS
WHICH IF NEED BE ALLOWS ME TO EXTEND MY STAY IN THE LOWER STRATA FOR AS LONG AS I WANT CAPTAIN I REPLIED I'LL REST CONTENT WITH MARVELING
THE WRITER WHOSE NARRATIVES RECORD THE LOFTY DEEDS OF THOSE HEROIC TIMES IS PLATO HIMSELF
I COULDN'T STAND STILL
I COULD EASILY DISTINGUISH THEM
IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS TO WEIGH ONLY THAT SAME NUMBER OF METRIC TONS
PERHAPS THEY DIDN'T WANT US TO GET TIRED OF THESE BEAUTIFUL THINGS
WHAT SORT OF CRAFT IS IT NED FROM ITS RIGGING AND ITS LOW MASTS THE CANADIAN REPLIED I BET IT'S A WARSHIP
CAPTAIN NEMO DIDN'T PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
HE HAD BECOME LESS SOCIABLE ALMOST SULLEN
NUMEROUS UNDERWATER VOLCANOES HAVE BEEN SIGHTED IN THIS PART OF THE OCEAN AND MANY SHIPS HAVE FELT TERRIFIC TREMORS WHEN PASSING OVER THESE TURBULENT DEPTHS
I TRIED TO FIGHT OFF THIS DROWSINESS
ARE YOU SORRY THAT FATE HAS CAST YOU INTO CAPTAIN NEMO'S HANDS THE CANADIAN PAUSED FOR A SHORT WHILE BEFORE REPLYING
SO I HAD A FELLOW COUNTRYMAN ON BOARD PERHAPS SEVERAL
THAT BALEEN WHALE KEPT COMING CLOSER
BESIDES LOOK LOOK
HATCHES THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED THE DAY BEFORE WERE NOW OPEN
SUDDENLY JUST AS ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING NED LAND'S VOICE WAS AUDIBLE
TO BE SO CAKED WITH THE LIMESTONE OF THESE WATERS THIS WRECKAGE MUST HAVE SPENT MANY A YEAR ON THE OCEAN FLOOR
THE NEXT DAY MARCH 20 IT STOPPED SNOWING
THEN LORD KNOWS WHY THE THOUGHT OF THE MONSTER CAME INTO MY HEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME
THERE WAS NO POINT IN DAMPENING THE ENERGY THEY WERE PUTTING INTO OUR ARDUOUS RESCUE WORK
FOR AN INSTANT IT BUMPED THE NAUTILUS'S SIDE THEN ALL SOUNDS CEASED
HE HAD LEFT HIS CANADIAN FRIEND SLEEPING LIKE A MAN WHO HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING ELSE
THUS THEY'VE ALREADY DEPOPULATED ALL OF BAFFIN BAY AND THEY'LL WIPE OUT A WHOLE CLASS OF USEFUL ANIMALS
BUT IF WE RETURNED TO THE PACIFIC FAR FROM EVERY POPULATED SHORE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO NED LAND'S PLANS
THE COMMON PERCH PRETTY FAIR EATING NED LAND REPLIED
A SHIP'S RIGGING WOULD HAVE BEEN UNUSABLE BECAUSE ALL ITS TACKLE WOULD HAVE JAMMED IN THE GROOVES OF THE PULLEYS
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS TURNING WHITE AND MILKY
A DREADFUL NOISE FILLED THE AIR A COMPLICATED NOISE MADE UP OF THE ROAR OF CRASHING BREAKERS THE HOWL OF THE WIND CLAPS OF THUNDER
BOILING WATER I EXCLAIMED
THIS RIOT OF RAINBOW TINTS WAS A WONDER A FEAST FOR THE EYES
SO DON'T SHRUG YOUR SHOULDERS SO BLITHELY AND DON'T DISCOUNT SOMETHING WITH THE FEEBLE EXCUSE THAT YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT WE'LL SOON SEE NED LAND SHOT BACK SHAKING HIS HEAD
AS IT WAS IN THE FIVE AND A HALF MONTHS SINCE FATE HAD BROUGHT US ON BOARD WE HAD CLEARED 14,000 LEAGUES AND OVER THIS TRACK LONGER THAN THE EARTH'S EQUATOR SO MANY FASCINATING OR FRIGHTENING INCIDENTS HAD BEGUILED OUR VOYAGE
I RECOGNIZED SOME SPURGES THAT LET THEIR CAUSTIC PURGATIVE SAP TRICKLE OUT
I SPENT THE EVENING IN READING WRITING AND THINKING
CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS MEN HAD COME TO BURY THEIR COMPANION IN THIS COMMUNAL RESTING PLACE ON THE INACCESSIBLE OCEAN FLOOR
BUT THE COUNTRY HAD PRACTICALLY NO ARMY OR NAVY
THE HATCHES WERE OPENED--OR TORN OFF IF YOU PREFER--AND WAVES OF CLEAN AIR WERE ADMITTED INTO EVERY PART OF THE NAUTILUS
TO THIS NO REPLY WAS POSSIBLE
SEE NED MY FRIEND SEE THE MONSTROUS RESULTS OF INTEMPERANCE DAMNATION THE CANADIAN SHOT BACK
I SAW HIS CALM EYES SOMETIMES PERK UP
OH WHY WAS I SO SHORT OF TIME
A FEW STROKES OF THE OAR BROUGHT THE SKIFF TO THE SAND WHERE IT RAN AGROUND
BUT YOU MUST ADMIT THAT CERTAIN CETACEANS DO GROW TO SIGNIFICANT SIZE SINCE THEY'RE SAID TO SUPPLY AS MUCH AS 120 METRIC TONS OF OIL THAT I'VE SEEN THE CANADIAN SAID
CARP PIKE UGH THE CANADIAN PUT IN WITH DISTINCT SCORN
BETTER ARMED THAN A BALEEN WHALE WHOSE UPPER JAW IS ADORNED SOLELY WITH WHALEBONE THE SPERM WHALE IS EQUIPPED WITH TWENTY-FIVE HUGE TEETH THAT ARE TWENTY CENTIMETERS HIGH HAVE CYLINDRICAL CONICAL SUMMITS AND WEIGH TWO POUNDS EACH
SO I CALLED CONSEIL TO MY SIDE WHILE AT AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF EIGHT TO NINE METERS THE NAUTILUS SLOWLY SKIMMED EVERY BEAUTIFUL ROCK ON THE EASTERLY COAST
FINALLY SOME FISH OF LARGER PROPORTIONS
I WAS LACKING A FEW THROATFULS OF AIR BUT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BY
I HEAR THAT SOME WILL COVER THEMSELVES WITH ALGAE AND FUCUS PLANTS
HE GATHERED ONLY ABOUT TEN SHELLFISH PER DIVE BECAUSE HE HAD TO TEAR THEM FROM THE BANKS WHERE EACH CLUNG WITH ITS TOUGH MASS OF FILAMENTS
I WAS WALKING IN THE VERY PLACE WHERE CONTEMPORARIES OF EARLY MAN HAD WALKED
IF THE NAUTILUS'S PUMPS CONTINUALLY INJECTED STREAMS OF BOILING WATER INTO THIS SPACE WOULDN'T THAT RAISE ITS TEMPERATURE AND DELAY ITS FREEZING IT'S WORTH TRYING I SAID RESOLUTELY
SHOULD I ALERT THEM
AT 6:30 NED LAND ENTERED MY STATEROOM
3,000,000 FRANCS I WENT ON
IF YOU LOOKED CAREFULLY YOU COULD SEE ITS BLACKISH BACK ALTERNATELY RISE AND FALL ABOVE THE WAVES FIVE MILES FROM THE NAUTILUS
THEY'RE KNOWN ONLY TO ME
SIR WHAT MAKES YOU ASSUME THIS WEALTH GOES TO WASTE WHEN I'M THE ONE AMASSING IT
FIVE NIGHTS AND FOUR DAYS I TOLD MY COMPANIONS
JUST THEN I HEARD INDISTINCT CHORDS FROM THE ORGAN MELANCHOLY HARMONIES FROM SOME UNDEFINABLE HYMN ACTUAL PLEADINGS FROM A SOUL TRYING TO SEVER ITS EARTHLY TIES
THEN HE WENT BACK UP EMPTIED HIS SACK PULLED UP HIS STONE AND STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN THE WHOLE PROCESS LASTING ONLY THIRTY SECONDS
ONE HELPED BY THE NORTHEAST TRADE WINDS RETURNS TO THE BAY OF BISCAY AND THE AZORES
I VENTURED A KNOCK AT THE DOOR OPENING INTO THE CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM
THIS WAS DUE TO THE REFLECTING POWER OF THE WALLS OF ICE WHICH THREW THE BEAMS OF OUR BEACON RIGHT BACK AT US
AND EVEN AFTER THEY'RE DEAD THERE'S STILL A MAJOR MARKET FOR THESE BIRDS
ACCORDINGLY THE WAGS CLAIMED THAT THIS SLIPPERY RASCAL HAD WAYLAID SOME PASSING TELEGRAM AND WAS MAKING THE MOST OF IT
LEANING MY ELBOWS ON THE BEACON HOUSING WHICH JUTTED FROM THE STERN OF THE PLATFORM I GOT SET TO SCOUR THAT WHOLE STRETCH OF SKY AND SEA
A TORRENT HAD CARRIED US FROM ONE SEA TO THE OTHER
IF YOU HELD A HARPOON MR LAND WOULDN'T YOUR HANDS BE ITCHING TO PUT IT TO WORK POSITIVELY SIR AND JUST FOR ONE DAY WOULD IT DISPLEASE YOU TO RETURN TO YOUR FISHERMAN'S TRADE AND ADD THIS CETACEAN TO THE LIST OF THOSE YOU'VE ALREADY HUNTED DOWN IT WOULDN'T DISPLEASE ME ONE BIT ALL RIGHT YOU CAN TRY YOUR LUCK THANK YOU SIR NED LAND REPLIED HIS EYES ABLAZE
THERE LIES OUR PEACEFUL CEMETERY HUNDREDS OF FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES AT LEAST CAPTAIN YOUR DEAD CAN SLEEP SERENELY THERE OUT OF THE REACH OF SHARKS YES SIR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED SOLEMNLY OF SHARKS AND MEN END OF THE FIRST PART AUTHOR'S NOTE
SO THE SKIFF DIDN'T LEAVE SHIPSIDE THAT DAY MUCH TO THE DISPLEASURE OF MR LAND WHO COULDN'T COMPLETE HIS PROVISIONS
THE CANADIAN CONSEIL AND I HAD A PRETTY LONG CONVERSATION ON THIS SUBJECT
WE FISHED UP THE HARPOON AND THE SKIFF STARTED OFF IN PURSUIT OF THE ANIMAL
ALL RIGHT NED I ASKED THE CANADIAN NOW WHAT DO YOU NEED GAME WITH FOUR PAWS PROFESSOR ARONNAX NED LAND REPLIED
IN ANY EVENT I THOUGHT IT BEST TO LET HIM HAVE HIS CHAT AND WE ALL THREE WENT TO SIT NEXT TO THE BEACON WHERE WE WERE LESS EXPOSED TO THE DAMP SPRAY FROM THE BILLOWS
A NARROW CHANNEL SEPARATED IT FROM A CONSIDERABLE SHORE PERHAPS A CONTINENT WHOSE LIMITS WE COULDN'T SEE
I OBJECT I REPLIED
AND OVERALL THIS VOYAGE WAS PLAGUED BY MISFORTUNE ULTIMATELY COSTING THE LIVES OF REAR ADMIRAL D'ENTRECASTEAUX TWO OF HIS SUBORDINATE OFFICERS AND SEVERAL SEAMEN FROM HIS CREW
IT'S PRUDENT BECAUSE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS YOU'RE RIGHT CONSEIL UNFORTUNATELY NED LAND SAID THEY'VE ONLY GIVEN US THE STANDARD MENU NED MY FRIEND CONSEIL ANSWERED WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF THEY'D GIVEN US NO LUNCH AT ALL THIS DOSE OF SANITY CUT THE HARPOONER'S COMPLAINTS CLEAN OFF
THERE EVEN MORE POWERFUL AND OBEDIENT THAN GAS ELECTRICITY DID MOST OF THE COOKING
AT THAT TIME THE SUMMER SOLSTICE OF THESE SOUTHERNMOST DISTRICTS THE SUN HAD STARTED BACK DOWN AND TOMORROW IT WOULD CAST ITS LAST RAYS
BUT ASIDE FROM THIS OCCURRING I DIDN'T DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF OUR MAKING CONTACT WITH THEM
MOREOVER I HOPED SOME BOOKS EVEN MORE RECENT WOULD PERMIT ME TO PINPOINT THE DATE PRECISELY
AND YOU'RE IN THE WRONG MR LAND I WENT ON
I HAD TO FIND OUT AT ALL COST I WANTED TO SPEAK I WANTED TO RIP OFF THE COPPER SPHERE IMPRISONING MY HEAD
THE CAPTAIN GAVE HIM HIS ORDERS IN THAT STRANGE LANGUAGE I COULDN'T EVEN IDENTIFY
SOME MEETING THE LIQUID SURFACE WOULD RICOCHET AND VANISH INTO THE SEA AT CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES
THE OUTLINES OF THE CONTINENTS ALLOW THE SEAS TO BE DIVIDED INTO FIVE MAJOR PARTS
LOBSTERS HERMIT CRABS PRAWNS MYSID SHRIMPS DADDY LONGLEGS ROCK CRABS AND A PRODIGIOUS NUMBER OF SEASHELLS SUCH AS COWRIES MUREX SNAILS AND LIMPETS
THERE YOU GO TALKING LIKE A NATURALIST BUT MEANTIME I'LL BE ACTING LIKE A BAKER
JUST THEN I WAS IN THE BOW LEANING OVER THE STARBOARD RAIL
JUST THEN I WAS ON THE PLATFORM
AND THIS WAS THE OCEAN THAT I WAS FIRST DESTINED TO CROSS UNDER THESE STRANGEST OF AUSPICES
A WALL OF SUPERB ROCKS STOOD BEFORE US IMPOSING IN ITS SHEER MASS
ONE OF THESE BOATS MADE A DREADFUL FIRST IMPRESSION
IT WAS AN ENJOYABLE AND IMPRESSIVE WAY OF NAVIGATING THAT DID INDEED RECALL THE MANEUVERS OF AN AIRSHIP RIDE WITH THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE THAT THE NAUTILUS FAITHFULLY OBEYED THE HANDS OF ITS HELMSMAN
THIS VALUABLE SUBSTANCE OFTEN MERGES WITH OTHER POLYPARIES FORMING COMPACT HOPELESSLY TANGLED UNITS KNOWN AS MACCIOTA AND I NOTED SOME WONDERFUL PINK SAMPLES OF THIS CORAL
THE STORM GLASS WHOSE MIXTURE DECOMPOSES TO FORETELL THE ARRIVAL OF TEMPESTS
I'LL ONLY POINT OUT THAT AFTER RAISING SO MANY OBJECTIONS AGAINST MY PLAN YOU'RE NOW CRUSHING ME UNDER ARGUMENTS IN ITS FAVOR CAPTAIN NEMO WAS RIGHT
I'LL DROWN BEFORE HE DOES JUST THEN PAST THE FRINGES OF A LARGE CLOUD THAT THE WIND WAS DRIVING EASTWARD THE MOON APPEARED
MERCY LOOK AT THESE COD HE SAID
AND ISN'T STEEL SURER THAN LEAD
YES MY BOY IT'S A LEFT-HANDED SHELL A LEFT-HANDED SHELL CONSEIL REPEATED HIS HEART POUNDING
IT TRANSPORTS THE ANIMAL THAT SECRETES IT WITHOUT THE ANIMAL STICKING TO IT
THAT SAME YEAR A HUMBLE SEAL FISHERMAN THE ENGLISHMAN WEDDELL WENT AS FAR AS LATITUDE 72 DEGREES 14 ON THE 35TH MERIDIAN AND AS FAR AS 74 DEGREES 15 ON THE 36TH
THE TWO HULLS ARE MANUFACTURED FROM BOILERPLATE STEEL WHOSE RELATIVE DENSITY IS 7.8 TIMES THAT OF WATER
BEST TO WAIT
OUR PROW POINTED TO THE INDIAN OCEAN
I TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE DENSE ICE BANK WE WERE GOING TO CONQUER
YOUR SHIP IS A CENTURY AHEAD OF ITS TIME PERHAPS SEVERAL CENTURIES
THE OLD SAYING STILL HOLDS GOOD
I WAS PURSUING THE POLICY THAT WE HAD SEEN THE LAST OF HIM WHEN ON NOVEMBER 16 WHILE REENTERING MY STATEROOM WITH NED AND CONSEIL I FOUND A NOTE ADDRESSED TO ME ON THE TABLE
FOR CHEMISTS IT'S A MIXTURE OF CALCIUM PHOSPHATE AND CALCIUM CARBONATE WITH A LITTLE GELATIN PROTEIN
WELL MR NATURALIST THE CANADIAN ASKED IN A GENTLY MOCKING TONE AND HOW ABOUT THAT MEDITERRANEAN WE'RE FLOATING ON ITS SURFACE NED MY FRIEND WHAT CONSEIL PUT IN
I SWIFTLY HOISTED MYSELF TO THE SUMMIT OF THIS HALF-SUBMERGED CREATURE OR OBJECT THAT WAS SERVING AS OUR REFUGE
LIKE SHAKESPEARE'S KING LEAR HE COURTS DEATH AND MADNESS IN A GREAT STORM THEN COMMITS MASS MURDER COLLAPSES IN CATATONIC PARALYSIS AND SUICIDALLY RUNS HIS SHIP INTO THE OCEAN'S MOST DANGEROUS WHIRLPOOL
IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN NED LAND DREW MY ATTENTION TO A FEARSOME COMMOTION OUT IN THIS HUGE SEAWEED
I TOOK A FEW STEPS INSIDE
IN THE AIR THERE PASSED SOOTY ALBATROSS WITH FOUR-METER WINGSPANS BIRDS APTLY DUBBED VULTURES OF THE OCEAN ALSO GIGANTIC PETRELS INCLUDING SEVERAL WITH ARCHING WINGS ENTHUSIASTIC EATERS OF SEAL THAT ARE KNOWN AS QUEBRANTAHUESOS AND CAPE PIGEONS A SORT OF SMALL DUCK THE TOPS OF THEIR BODIES BLACK AND WHITE--IN SHORT A WHOLE SERIES OF PETRELS SOME WHITISH WITH WINGS TRIMMED IN BROWN OTHERS BLUE AND EXCLUSIVE TO THESE ANTARCTIC SEAS THE FORMER SO OILY I TOLD CONSEIL THAT INHABITANTS OF THE FAROE ISLANDS SIMPLY FIT THE BIRD WITH A WICK THEN LIGHT IT UP SPANISH
THE THRUST OF THE WATERS WAS SO GREAT THE NAUTILUS SWERVED AWAY
FOR TWO DAYS WE VISITED THESE DEEP AND DESERTED WATERS BY MEANS OF OUR SLANTING FINS
THE ISLET OF APHROESSA WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE MEASURING 300 FEET IN DIAMETER AND THIRTY FEET IN HEIGHT
BUT THIS LONG IRON CYLINDER LYING IN THE BAY WITH NO MASTS OR FUNNELS--WHAT WERE THEY TO MAKE OF IT
NOW THEN I'LL BE QUITE ASTONISHED IF THAT GOOD-NATURED SATELLITE DOESN'T SUFFICIENTLY RAISE THESE MASSES OF WATER AND DO ME A FAVOR FOR WHICH I'LL BE FOREVER GRATEFUL THIS SAID CAPTAIN NEMO WENT BELOW AGAIN TO THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR FOLLOWED BY HIS CHIEF OFFICER
THE SHIP'S OFFICERS SHARED THE VIEWS OF THEIR LEADER
IS CAPTAIN NEMO ALIVE
THEY DIDN'T MOVE AS WE APPROACHED
I TRIED TO CALL OUT
YET I DECIDED TO RETURN TO THE NAUTILUS
THE PROPELLER WAS INSTANTLY SET IN MOTION AND THE LOG GAVE OUR SPEED AS TWENTY MILES PER HOUR
FOLLOWED BY HIS CHIEF OFFICER CAPTAIN NEMO ENTERED THE LOUNGE
OFFICERS WERE PROBING THE INCREASING GLOOM WITH THEIR NIGHT GLASSES
HOWEVER ONE BIRD UNIQUE TO THESE SHORES WHICH NEVER PASSES BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF THE ARU AND PAPUAN ISLANDS WAS MISSING FROM THIS COLLECTION
GUIDED BY HIS SKILLFUL HANDS THE NAUTILUS PASSED BY ALL THESE DIFFERENT MASSES OF ICE WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED BY SIZE AND SHAPE WITH A PRECISION THAT ENRAPTURED CONSEIL
BUT SOME ARE EDIBLE THE HARPOONER REPLIED
TOMORROW TODAY NED LAND SAID
CAPTAIN NEMO'S FIRST CONCERN WAS TO REVIVE THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN
FROM THE LOUNGE WHERE I WAS WRITING UP THE INCIDENTS OF THIS EXCURSION TO THE POLAR CONTINENT I COULD HEAR THE CALLS OF PETREL AND ALBATROSS CAVORTING IN THE MIDST OF THE TURMOIL
I REALIZED THAT ITS SPUR HAD JUST BUMPED A BLOCK OF ICE
THEY EXAMINED THE OCEAN WITH THE MOST SCRUPULOUS CARE
SOON I THREW MYSELF DOWN ON A COUCH AND PICKED UP A BOOK WHICH MY EYES SKIMMED MECHANICALLY
THEY CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
IN THE SPRING THEY DELIGHT IN SWIMMING UP THE GREAT RIVERS FIGHTING THE CURRENTS OF THE VOLGA DANUBE PO RHINE LOIRE AND ODER WHILE FEEDING ON HERRING MACKEREL SALMON AND CODFISH
OBVIOUSLY WE WERE JUST GROPING BLINDLY
THE ADROIT CANADIAN SPENT HIS TIME PREPARING THE MEAT AND FLOUR PRODUCTS HE HAD BROUGHT FROM GUEBOROA ISLAND
LOOK AT ITS SPIRAL OH MASTER CAN TRUST ME ON THIS CONSEIL SAID TAKING THE VALUABLE SHELL IN TREMBLING HANDS BUT NEVER HAVE I FELT SUCH EXCITEMENT AND THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO BE EXCITED
BUT MAY I ADDRESS A QUESTION TO YOU YOU MAY NOT SIR AFTER THAT I STOPPED OBJECTING AND STARTED OBEYING SINCE RESISTANCE WAS USELESS
HE WAS BENDING OVER HIS WORKTABLE AND HADN'T HEARD ME
IF MASTER SAYS SO CONSEIL REPLIED
I'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT PICTURE
THE TWO MEN HELD A QUICK EXCHANGE IN THEIR INCOMPREHENSIBLE LANGUAGE AND EITHER THE CHIEF OFFICER HAD BEEN ALERTED PREVIOUSLY OR HE FOUND THE PLAN FEASIBLE BECAUSE HE SHOWED NO SURPRISE
THEN AFTER SIGHTING DOWN ITS BARREL FOR A FEW SECONDS HE WOULD STRAIGHTEN UP AND RESUME HIS WALK
THE SEA WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE FOR A ONE-MILE RADIUS AROUND THE NAUTILUS
A GLORY-OF-THE-SEAS THE MOST VALUABLE SHELL IN THE EAST INDIES
I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM
I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM
I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM
LITTLE BY LITTLE THE ICE BANK WAS TURNING INTO AN ICE FIELD AGAIN
MY DEPARTURE FOR FRANCE WAS SET FOR EARLY MAY
I WAS AFRAID TO GUESS
A FEW FRIGHTENED SPERM WHALES WERE FLEEING TOWARD THE HORIZON
YOU'D SAY YOUR AFTER-MEAL GRACE EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T GET ANY FOOD FOR YOUR BEFORE-MEAL BLESSING AND YOU'D STARVE TO DEATH RATHER THAN COMPLAIN WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO CONSEIL ASKED
TRAVELING IN THE LEAD THE COMPASS RAN AFOUL OF BREAKERS ON THE SOUTHERLY COAST
WHERE AND WHEN HAD HE BUILT IT AND HOW COULD HE HAVE BUILT IT IN SECRET
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS NED LAND SHOUTED EXPLODING FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME
ON THE MORNING OF THE 24TH IN LATITUDE 12 DEGREES 5 SOUTH AND LONGITUDE 94 DEGREES 33 WE RAISED KEELING ISLAND A MADREPORIC UPHEAVING PLANTED WITH MAGNIFICENT COCONUT TREES WHICH HAD BEEN VISITED BY MR DARWIN AND CAPTAIN FITZROY
AS FAR AS THE EQUATOR THIS WHOLE SEAFLOOR IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION BY PLUTONIC FORCES
SO HAVING CONCLUDED THAT OUR SOLE CHANCE FOR SALVATION LAY IN BEING PICKED UP BY THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S LONGBOATS WE HAD TO TAKE STEPS TO WAIT FOR THEM AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
EVEN CAPTAIN NEMO'S PERSONAL INSIGHTS WERE DENIED ME BECAUSE THAT MYSTIFYING INDIVIDUAL DIDN'T APPEAR ONE SINGLE TIME DURING OUR HIGH-SPEED CROSSING
HE HAD CAUGHT ME ON MY WEAK SIDE AND I MOMENTARILY FORGOT THAT NOT EVEN THIS SUBLIME EXPERIENCE WAS WORTH THE LOSS OF MY FREEDOM
BY THEN WE WERE PASSING BETWEEN SICILY AND THE COAST OF TUNISIA
I FIRE OFF A TELEGRAM AND THAT'S THAT RIGHT I SAID TIPSY FROM ALL THESE WONDERS NOTHING TO IT AFTER PASSING THE WELL OF THE COMPANIONWAY THAT LED TO THE PLATFORM I SAW A CABIN 2 METERS LONG IN WHICH CONSEIL AND NED LAND ENRAPTURED WITH THEIR MEAL WERE BUSY DEVOURING IT TO THE LAST CRUMB
THE DAYS PASSED QUICKLY AND I NO LONGER KEPT TRACK OF THEM
FINALLY THE SHIP'S RAYS APPEARED
HOSTS OF BIRDS IN THE AIR AND MYRIADS OF FISH UNDER THE WATERS WHICH VARIED FROM INTENSE BLUE TO OLIVE GREEN DEPENDING ON THE DEPTH
THE TRADESMEN OF CADIZ HAD NEGOTIATED A CHARTER WHEREBY THEY WERE TO RECEIVE ALL MERCHANDISE COMING FROM THE WEST INDIES
FINALLY CLASSED IN THE LOWEST ORDER THE SMALLEST PEARLS ARE KNOWN BY THE NAME SEED PEARLS
BUT THE METHODS YOU'RE USING STRIKE ME AS PRIMITIVE
DON'T YOU SEE THAT BY SOLIDIFYING IT COULD BURST THESE TRACTS OF ICE IMPRISONING US JUST AS ITS FREEZING CAN BURST THE HARDEST STONES
FROM THEN ON NO MORE MOLLUSKS NO MORE ZOOPHYTES NO MORE ARTICULATES
A FIRST-CLASS BAROMETER MY FRIEND YES SIR A NATURAL BAROMETER THAT DIDN'T LET ME DOWN WHEN I NAVIGATED THE NARROWS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN JUST THEN ITS PEAK APPEARED BEFORE US STANDING OUT DISTINCTLY AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE SKIES
YOU'LL BE FREE HERE AND IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT FREEDOM MOREOVER TOTALLY RELATED TO IT I'LL LAY ON YOU JUST ONE CONDITION
OUR ENGINES TRIED TO OFFER RESISTANCE BY CHURNING THE WAVES WITH PROPELLER IN REVERSE BUT THE NAUTILUS WENT WITH THE TORRENT AS SWIFT AS AN ARROW
YOU CAN HEAR THE PUMPS WORKING
SO THIS MILK WAS A WORTHWHILE RESERVE RATION FOR US BECAUSE IN THE FORM OF SALT BUTTER OR CHEESE IT WOULD PROVIDE A PLEASANT CHANGE OF PACE FROM OUR STANDARD FARE
TAKING REFUGE IN MY STATEROOM WE STARED AT EACH OTHER WITHOUT PRONOUNCING A WORD
ON THE REAR PANELING BENEATH THE PORTRAITS OF HIS HEROES I SAW THE PORTRAIT OF A STILL-YOUTHFUL WOMAN WITH TWO LITTLE CHILDREN
THIS ORDER WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THE CLASS CONSISTS OF TWO FAMILIES
BY THEN IT WAS THE BAD SEASON IN THESE SOUTHERNMOST REGIONS BECAUSE JULY IN THIS ZONE CORRESPONDS TO OUR JANUARY IN EUROPE
I WATCHED IT ON THE MAP WITH MY EYES I SAW IT LOSE ITSELF IN THE IMMENSENESS OF THE PACIFIC AND I FELT MYSELF SWEPT ALONG WITH IT WHEN NED LAND AND CONSEIL APPEARED IN THE LOUNGE DOORWAY
OUR NAVIGATING CONTINUED UNDER THESE CONDITIONS UNTIL MARCH 13
LET MASTER HAVE NO FEARS ABOUT BREATHING
AS FOR CONSEIL HE HAD COME ALONG OUT OF SIMPLE CURIOSITY
THEN ONE FINE DAY THE ANIMAL DIVES AND DRAGS ALL ITS OCCUPANTS DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS LIKE IN THE VOYAGES OF SINBAD THE SAILOR I ANSWERED LAUGHING
HANGING FROM ITS WALLS A DOZEN DIVING OUTFITS WERE WAITING FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTED TO TAKE A STROLL
I TURNED TO CAPTAIN NEMO
AND HE PRESSED AN ELECTRIC BUTTON TRANSMITTING AN ORDER TO THE CREW'S QUARTERS
I INFORMED THE CAPTAIN OF NED'S PROPOSITION WHICH WAS PROMPTLY ACCEPTED
EXTENDING OVER AN EXPANSE OF 100 LEAGUES NORTH TO SOUTH AND OVER 90 LEAGUES EAST TO WEST THIS ISLAND GROUP LIES BETWEEN LATITUDE 2 DEGREES AND 6 DEGREES SOUTH AND BETWEEN LONGITUDE 174 DEGREES AND 179 DEGREES WEST
THAT'S WHAT COMES ABOUT PROFESSOR
I LISTENED AT THE DOOR TO HIS STATEROOM
IT'S AN ACTUAL BOAT INDEED
I FELT I WAS DONE FOR
THIS WAS THE LAST STRAW AND IT RESULTED IN AROUSING PUBLIC PASSIONS ALL OVER AGAIN
ASSUREDLY I SAID TO MYSELF HE'S CONTRACTED SOME MENTAL ILLNESS
HOW LONG THAT DAY SEEMED THE LAST I WOULD SPEND ABOARD THE NAUTILUS
OUR PATH WAS BORDERED BY HOPELESSLY TANGLED BUSHES FORMED FROM SNARLS OF SHRUBS ALL COVERED WITH LITTLE STAR-SHAPED WHITE-STREAKED FLOWERS
THEY KNEW NOTHING
THEY WEREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FAILURE
IN FACT THE POPULOUS SHORES OFFERED READY REFUGE EVERYWHERE
THUS IF THIS NEW YEAR ISN'T A HAPPY ONE FOR ME IT WILL BE FOR HIM AND VICE VERSA
COMMANDER FARRAGUT FELT AND WITH GOOD REASON THAT IT WAS BEST TO STAY IN DEEP WATERS AND KEEP HIS DISTANCE FROM CONTINENTS OR ISLANDS WHOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THE ANIMAL ALWAYS SEEMED TO AVOID--"NO DOUBT OUR BOSUN SAID BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH WATER FOR HIM SO THE FRIGATE KEPT WELL OUT WHEN PASSING THE TUAMOTU MARQUESAS AND HAWAIIAN ISLANDS THEN CUT THE TROPIC OF CANCER AT LONGITUDE 132 DEGREES AND HEADED FOR THE SEAS OF CHINA
LET ME GET WITHIN FOUR HARPOON LENGTHS OF IT THE CANADIAN SHOT BACK AND IT HAD BETTER LISTEN BUT TO GET NEAR IT THE COMMANDER WENT ON I'D HAVE TO PUT A WHALEBOAT AT YOUR DISPOSAL CERTAINLY SIR THAT WOULD BE GAMBLING WITH THE LIVES OF MY MEN AND WITH MY OWN THE HARPOONER REPLIED SIMPLY
IN PLACE OF LEAVES MOST OF THEM SPROUTED BLADES OF UNPREDICTABLE SHAPE WHICH WERE CONFINED TO A NARROW GAMUT OF COLORS CONSISTING ONLY OF PINK CRIMSON GREEN OLIVE TAN AND BROWN
THAT WAS A STROKE OF GENIUS CATCHING ONE OF THESE LIVE BIRDS WITH YOUR BARE HANDS IF MASTER WILL EXAMINE IT CLOSELY HE'LL SEE THAT I DESERVE NO GREAT PRAISE AND WHY NOT CONSEIL BECAUSE THIS BIRD IS AS DRUNK AS A LORD DRUNK YES MASTER DRUNK FROM THE NUTMEGS IT WAS DEVOURING UNDER THAT NUTMEG TREE WHERE I CAUGHT IT
NUTMEG ON WHICH THESE BIRDS HABITUALLY GORGE THEMSELVES SWEETENS THEIR FLESH AND MAKES IT DELICIOUS EATING
SO I HAD ASSUMED THAT CAPTAIN NEMO IN ADJUSTING HIS COURSE WOULD GO AROUND EACH OBSTACLE OR WOULD HUG THE WALLS AND FOLLOW THE WINDINGS OF THE TUNNEL
I STAYED IN MY STATEROOM
I STAYED IN MY STATEROOM
NOON I CALLED
HERE THE CAKED HEIGHTS OF AN ACROPOLIS ALONG WITH THE FLUID FORMS OF A PARTHENON
SINCE FATE HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE YOU'LL STAY ABOARD MY VESSEL
THEY AREN'T FREQUENTED BY LIONS TIGERS PANTHERS OR OTHER QUADRUPEDS
THE PROPELLER WAS SET IN MOTION
AS FOR ANY HOPE OF BEING RESCUED BY COMMANDER FARRAGUT THAT HAD TO BE RENOUNCED COMPLETELY
THE HEAT INSIDE THE EARTH IS GROWING WEAKER THE TEMPERATURE IN THE GLOBE'S LOWER STRATA IS COOLING APPRECIABLY EVERY CENTURY AND TO OUR GLOBE'S DETRIMENT BECAUSE ITS HEAT IS ITS LIFE BUT THE SUN THE SUN ISN'T ENOUGH CONSEIL
LOOKING LIKE BIG BLUISH SHADOWS THRESHER SHARKS WENT BY EIGHT FEET LONG AND GIFTED WITH AN EXTREMELY ACUTE SENSE OF SMELL
IN ALL HONESTY I WAS DEAD TIRED BY THE TIME I SPOTTED A HAZY GLOW HALF A MILE AWAY CUTTING THROUGH THE DARKNESS OF THE WATERS
I REGARDED HIM WITH A MIXTURE OF FEAR AND FASCINATION IN THE SAME WAY NO DOUBT THAT OEDIPUS REGARDED THE SPHINX
BY 11:30 WE HAD ARRIVED AT OUR LANDING PLACE
OPEN SEA HE TOLD ME
THERE SEVERAL GROUPS OF SEA COWS WERE LIVING IN FAMILY UNITS
THE FRIGATE APPROACHED WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND STOPPED TWO CABLE LENGTHS FROM THE ANIMAL AND COASTED
THAT'S GOOD NEWS THE CANADIAN REPLIED BUT WHERE'S THE NAUTILUS GOING I'M UNABLE TO SAY NED AFTER THE SOUTH POLE DOES OUR CAPTAIN WANT TO TACKLE THE NORTH POLE THEN GO BACK TO THE PACIFIC BY THE NOTORIOUS NORTHWEST PASSAGE I WOULDN'T DOUBLE DARE HIM CONSEIL REPLIED
SO THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WASN'T LACKING IN MEANS OF DESTRUCTION
YOU UNDERSTAND NED LAND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
WE WERE STRETCHED OUT IN THIS DELIGHTFUL CAVE FOR AN HOUR
POLYPS AND ECHINODERMS ABOUNDED ON THE SEAFLOOR
SO I WAS OBLIGED NOT TO EXCEED THIS WEIGHT WHILE BUILDING IT TO THE AFORESAID DIMENSIONS
THE WORD ENTER ANSWERED ME
ARRIVING WITHIN TWENTY FEET OF THE SKIFF THE DUGONG STOPPED SHARPLY SNIFFING THE AIR WITH ITS HUGE NOSTRILS PIERCED NOT AT THE TIP OF ITS MUZZLE BUT ON ITS TOPSIDE
OUR CREATOR CAST THEM USING A COLOSSAL MOLD THAT TIME HAS GRADUALLY MADE SMALLER
AND NOW NED WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY A PROMISING OPPORTUNITY ONE THAT LEADS THE NAUTILUS ON A CLOUDY NIGHT WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF SOME EUROPEAN COAST AND YOU'LL TRY TO GET AWAY BY SWIMMING YES IF WE'RE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SHORE AND THE SHIP'S AFLOAT ON THE SURFACE
THE NEXT DAY FEBRUARY 10 SEVERAL SHIPS APPEARED RUNNING ON OUR OPPOSITE TACK
BUT I COULDN'T MAKE UP MY MIND ABOUT CERTAIN OTHERWISE EXCELLENT DISHES AND I COULDN'T EVEN TELL WHETHER THEIR CONTENTS BELONGED TO THE VEGETABLE OR THE ANIMAL KINGDOM
BUT ON FEBRUARY 3 1866 A NEW ISLET NAMED GEORGE ISLAND EMERGED IN THE MIDST OF SULFUROUS STEAM NEAR NEA KAMENI AND WAS FUSED TO IT ON THE 6TH OF THE SAME MONTH
THE THREE OF US FOLLOWED HIM AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER MIRACULOUSLY SAFE WE REACHED THE FISHERMAN'S LONGBOAT
WE'LL SUCCEED THE NEXT TIME AND AS SOON AS THIS EVENING IF NEED BE WHAT'S THE NAUTILUS'S HEADING I ASKED
NED LAND WAS UNWILLING TO LEAVE HIS PROVISIONS BEHIND AND DESPITE THE IMPENDING DANGER HE CLUTCHED HIS PIG ON ONE SIDE HIS KANGAROOS ON THE OTHER AND SCAMPERED OFF WITH RESPECTABLE SPEED
INSTEAD OF BREATHING IT THEMSELVES THEY HAD SAVED IT FOR ME AND WHILE THEY WERE SUFFOCATING THEY POURED LIFE INTO ME DROP BY DROP
BUT STREAKS OF WATER PARTED BY THE SHIP'S SPUR SOMETIMES THREADED BEFORE OUR EYES WITH EXTRAORDINARY SPEED
THERE VERY PUZZLED NED LAND AND CONSEIL WATCHED THE CREWMEN OPENING THE HATCHES WHILE A FRIGHTFUL CLAMOR AND FURIOUS SHOUTS RESOUNDED OUTSIDE
AREN'T YOU AWARE THAT THIS FORCE COULD BE THE INSTRUMENT OF OUR SALVATION RATHER THAN OUR DESTRUCTION YES CAPTAIN MAYBE SO
I FOLLOWED CAPTAIN NEMO DOWN GANGWAYS LOCATED FOR EASY TRANSIT AND I ARRIVED AMIDSHIPS
THEN HIS SHIPS ARRIVED AT THE UNKNOWN REEFS OF VANIKORO
THE ATTACK HAS COME
I NOW KNOW THAT SHEER CHANCE HAS PLACED IN MY PRESENCE PROFESSOR PIERRE ARONNAX SPECIALIST IN NATURAL HISTORY AT THE PARIS MUSEUM AND ENTRUSTED WITH A SCIENTIFIC MISSION ABROAD HIS MANSERVANT CONSEIL AND NED LAND A HARPOONER OF CANADIAN ORIGIN ABOARD THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN A FRIGATE IN THE NATIONAL NAVY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA I BOWED IN AGREEMENT
THEN IT REAPPEARED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SHIP EITHER BY CIRCLING AROUND US OR BY GLIDING UNDER OUR HULL
THEREFORE I OBEY NONE OF ITS REGULATIONS AND I INSIST THAT YOU NEVER INVOKE THEM IN FRONT OF ME THIS WAS PLAIN SPEAKING
A FEW MINUTES LATER WE ENCOUNTERED THE SHARK'S CORPSE AGAIN FLOATING
THE DEVILFISH IS MERELY A MOLLUSK AND EVEN THIS NAME HINTS AT ITS SEMILIQUID FLESH BECAUSE IT'S LATIN MEANING SOFT ONE
SUCH WAS THE REGION OUR NAUTILUS WAS VISITING JUST THEN
WE WERE THE ICE BANK'S PRISONERS
THAT HUNTING TRIP IN THE CRESPO FORESTS OUR RUNNING AGROUND IN THE TORRES STRAIT THE CORAL CEMETERY THE PEARL FISHERIES OF CEYLON THE ARABIC TUNNEL THE FIRES OF SANTORINI THOSE MILLIONS IN THE BAY OF VIGO ATLANTIS THE SOUTH POLE
ON MAY 30 IN SIGHT OF LAND'S END IT PASSED BETWEEN THE LOWERMOST TIP OF ENGLAND AND THE SCILLY ISLANDS WHICH IT LEFT BEHIND TO STARBOARD
I DIDN'T GO LOOKING FOR HIM
ATTACKING CETACEANS WITH THRUSTS FROM A SPUR
SUCH A MAN BRINGS A NATION MORE HONOR THAN THE GREATEST COMMANDERS
I LIKE THINGS OVER AND DONE WITH
ANOTHER RESIDENT OF THESE SEAS CAUGHT MY ATTENTION AND REVIVED ALL MY MEMORIES OF ANTIQUITY
HE UNDERSTOOD THE CANADIAN'S FRAME OF MIND AND ADDRESSED HIM DIRECTLY
I FOLLOWED HIM AND WENT BACK TO THE MAIN LOUNGE
CAPTAIN NEMO AND I
MY HEART WAS POUNDING
ASSUMING THE SAME WORK WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED EVERY TWELVE HOURS IT WOULD STILL TAKE FIVE NIGHTS AND FOUR DAYS TO SEE THE UNDERTAKING THROUGH TO COMPLETION
FOR UNDERWATER WORK PROJECTS THE WORKMAN WEARS A WATERPROOF SUIT WITH HIS HEAD IMPRISONED IN A METAL CAPSULE WHILE HE RECEIVES AIR FROM ABOVE BY MEANS OF FORCE PUMPS AND FLOW REGULATORS THAT'S THE STANDARD EQUIPMENT FOR A DIVING SUIT I SAID
IT MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK WHEN WE REACHED A NARROW VALLEY GOUGED BETWEEN HIGH VERTICAL WALLS AND LOCATED 150 METERS DOWN
TOWED IN THE SAME WAY MY COMPANIONS WENT WITH ME
THEN GOING ON
ONLY A CRAFT WITHOUT SAILS DRIVEN BY AN ELECTRIC MOTOR THAT NEEDED NO COAL COULD FACE SUCH HIGH LATITUDES
JUST AS WE WERE BOARDING HE SPOTTED SEVERAL TREES TWENTY-FIVE TO THIRTY FEET HIGH BELONGING TO THE PALM SPECIES
I'M HUNGRY GIVE ME A BITE TO EAT OH CONSEIL PUT IN THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE SO UNINTELLIGENT BY NATURE AS HE WAS SAYING THESE WORDS THE DOOR OPENED
I HALF OPENED MY EYES
HE'S SURE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FIRST CHANCE THAT COMES HIS WAY
I THINK THAT'S THE STANDARD DEFINITION OF TRAPPED AT LEAST IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD SO PROFESSOR ARONNAX YOU THINK THE NAUTILUS WON'T BE ABLE TO FLOAT CLEAR ONLY WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY CAPTAIN SINCE THE SEASON IS ALREADY TOO ADVANCED FOR YOU TO DEPEND ON AN ICE BREAKUP OH PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED IN AN IRONIC TONE YOU NEVER CHANGE
NOW IN OPEN WATER THE NAUTILUS TOOK A DIRECT COURSE TO THE POLE WITHOUT VEERING FROM THE 52ND MERIDIAN
BUT THAT DAMNED ANIMAL ALSO DID A SPEED OF 18.5
DON'T BE ALARMED THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME
I WAS PREPARED TO GREET CAPTAIN NEMO BUT IT WAS HIS CHIEF OFFICER WHO APPEARED--WHOM I HAD ALREADY MET DURING OUR FIRST VISIT WITH THE CAPTAIN
AFTER ALL I'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO BELIEVE IN YOUR CAPTAIN'S LITTLE PASSAGEWAY AND MAY HEAVEN GRANT IT REALLY DOES TAKE US TO THE MEDITERRANEAN THE SAME EVENING AT LATITUDE 21 DEGREES 30 NORTH THE NAUTILUS WAS AFLOAT ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND DRAWING NEARER TO THE ARAB COAST
HALF OVERTURNED IT SHIPPED A TON OR TWO OF WATER THAT WE HAD TO BAIL OUT
BUT THIS FORAGING TOOK UP A GOOD DEAL OF OUR TIME WHICH EVEN SO WE HAD NO CAUSE TO REGRET
THE NAUTILUS KEPT TO ITS SOUTHEASTERLY HEADING
SO THE NATIVES HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO CREATE FAKE ONES LIKE PEOPLE CREATE FAKE PEARLS OR DIAMONDS WHAT CONSEIL EXCLAIMED
IT'S MEANT TO BE A REFUGE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ITS COMMANDER PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEVERED ALL TIES WITH THE SHORE PERHAPS CONSEIL SAID BUT IN A NUTSHELL THE NAUTILUS CAN HOLD ONLY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MEN SO COULDN'T MASTER ESTIMATE THEIR MAXIMUM HOW CONSEIL BY CALCULATING IT
HE'S A COMPLETELY DISINTERESTED PARTY ON THIS QUESTION
INSTEAD LET'S TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE WE ARE I STARTED MOVING GROPING MY WAY
ACCORDINGLY OUR SPEED WAS TWENTY-FIVE MILES THAT IS TWELVE FOUR-KILOMETER LEAGUES PER HOUR
HERE ARE THE ONES THAT THE NAUTILUS'S NETS MOST FREQUENTLY HAULED ON BOARD
CLASS OF CARTILAGINOUS FISH ORDER CHONDROPTERYGIA WITH FIXED GILLS SUBORDER SELACIA FAMILY RAJIIFORMA GENUS ELECTRIC RAY YES MY FRIEND I ANSWERED IT WAS AN ELECTRIC RAY THAT PUT YOU IN THIS DEPLORABLE STATE OH MASTER CAN TRUST ME ON THIS CONSEIL SHOT BACK
I ASKED THEM THE PURPOSE OF THEIR VISIT
VERNE'S TITLE THE FRENCH TITLE OF THIS NOVEL IS VINGT MILLE LIEUES SOUS LES MERS
METAL BARS ARCHED
THE UNDERWATER COALFIELDS 206 11
THAT STILL MEANT FORTY-EIGHT HOURS OF WORK
IT DID NOT
AFTER SPENDING FIVE MINUTES IN THIS TRANCE HE TURNED TO US
MEANWHILE FURIOUS AT THESE GOINGS ON NED LAND GAVE FREE REIN TO HIS INDIGNATION
BALEEN WHALES LIKE TO FREQUENT THE SOUTHERNMOST AND NORTHERNMOST SEAS
THE NEXT DAY JANUARY 6
LET'S GO CHANGE CLOTHES ON THE NAUTILUS THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR LATER WE HAD COMPLETED OUR CIRCULAR STROLL AND WERE BACK ON BOARD
A SINGLE NIGHT AND DAY WERE ENOUGH TO OBLITERATE THIS ATLANTIS WHOSE HIGHEST PEAKS MADEIRA THE AZORES THE CANARIES THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS STILL EMERGE ABOVE THE WAVES
IT THEN DAWNED ON ME TO ASK CAPTAIN NEMO IF HE HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED THIS POLE WHICH NO HUMAN BEING HAD EVER TROD UNDERFOOT
WHILE ONE OF US LAY ON HIS BACK STAYING MOTIONLESS WITH ARMS CROSSED AND LEGS OUTSTRETCHED THE OTHER WOULD SWIM AND PROPEL HIS PARTNER FORWARD
THEN THEY REMOVE THE OYSTER'S MEATY TISSUE BOIL IT AND FINALLY STRAIN IT IN ORDER TO EXTRACT EVEN THE SMALLEST PEARLS DO THE PRICES OF THESE PEARLS DIFFER DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE CONSEIL ASKED
THIS LADDER LEADS TO A MANHOLE CUT INTO THE NAUTILUS'S HULL AND CORRESPONDING TO A COMPARABLE HOLE CUT INTO THE SIDE OF THE SKIFF
AFTER I PARTED THEM WITH MY HANDS THESE OTHERWISE MOTIONLESS PLANTS WOULD SHOOT RIGHT BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL POSITIONS
IT HAD AN AUSTERE ALMOST MONASTIC APPEARANCE
MEANWHILE SHELLS FELL AROUND US IN INCREASING NUMBERS
I'M THE OPPRESSED AND THERE ARE MY OPPRESSORS
IN 1868 ON THIS 21ST DAY OF MARCH I MYSELF CAPTAIN NEMO HAVE REACHED THE SOUTH POLE AT 90 DEGREES AND I HEREBY CLAIM THIS ENTIRE PART OF THE GLOBE EQUAL TO ONE-SIXTH OF THE KNOWN CONTINENTS IN THE NAME OF WHICH SOVEREIGN CAPTAIN IN MY OWN NAME SIR SO SAYING CAPTAIN NEMO UNFURLED A BLACK FLAG BEARING A GOLD N ON ITS QUARTERED BUNTING
IT CONTAINS A SUMMARY OF MY RESEARCH UNDER THE SEA AND GOD WILLING IT WON'T PERISH WITH ME
IN DESPAIR POOR NED WENT INTO SECLUSION LIKE CAPTAIN NEMO
ON THIS OCCASION I WITNESSED ONE OF THE FINEST GUNSHOTS EVER TO THRILL THE MARROW OF A HUNTER
I WENT OUT ON THE PLATFORM WHERE I COULD BARELY STAND UPRIGHT AGAINST THE JOLTS OF THE BILLOWS
YOU CAN REPAY YOUR DEBT BY COMING WITH ME WHEN I LEAVE THIS INFERNAL NAUTILUS BY THE WAY CONSEIL SAID ARE WE GOING IN A FAVORABLE DIRECTION YES I REPLIED BECAUSE WE'RE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN AND HERE THE SUN IS DUE NORTH SURE NED LAND WENT ON BUT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER WE'LL MAKE FOR THE ATLANTIC OR THE PACIFIC IN OTHER WORDS WHETHER WE'LL END UP IN WELL-TRAVELED OR DESERTED SEAS I HAD NO REPLY TO THIS AND I FEARED THAT CAPTAIN NEMO WOULDN'T TAKE US HOMEWARD BUT RATHER INTO THAT HUGE OCEAN WASHING THE SHORES OF BOTH ASIA AND AMERICA
IN SHORT THE WHOLE PALETTE OF A COLOR-HAPPY PAINTER
SIMILARLY HERE ARE SOME DOLPHIN LIVERS YOU MIGHT MISTAKE FOR STEWED PORK
NEAR ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHILE ON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN THE NAUTILUS FELL IN WITH A HERD OF BALEEN WHALES
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT HOW THE SKIFF ESCAPED FROM THE MAELSTROM'S FEARSOME EDDIES HOW NED LAND CONSEIL AND I GOT OUT OF THAT WHIRLPOOL I'M UNABLE TO SAY
BLACK POLISHED WITHOUT MOSS OR OTHER BLEMISH CARVED INTO STRANGE SHAPES SITTING FIRMLY ON A CARPET OF SAND THAT SPARKLED BENEATH OUR STREAMS OF ELECTRIC LIGHT
THAT WAS ONE DEGREE GAINED
I DIDN'T ENCOUNTER CAPTAIN NEMO WHILE GOING DOWN THE GANGWAYS
ITS OPEN MOUTH LET WATER FLOW THROUGH ITS WHALEBONE LIKE A MURMURING SURF
CAN'T YOU OR ONE OF YOUR MEN NEVER SIR THE CAPTAIN SAID SWIFTLY INTERRUPTING ME
SO I THINK THAT EXCAVATING THOSE SANDS WOULD BRING TO LIGHT A GREAT MANY WEAPONS AND TOOLS OF EGYPTIAN ORIGIN OBVIOUSLY I REPLIED
AND I CAN'T DO A THING
THEY BRAYED LIKE DONKEYS
THE SUN WAS ALREADY SENDING SUFFICIENT LIGHT UNDER THESE WAVES
EMERGING FROM THE STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR THE NAUTILUS TOOK TO THE HIGH SEAS
I STOOD THERE UNTIL SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING CAPTAIN NEMO NEVER SEEMING TO NOTICE ME
THE ROCKY MASS WAS GOUGED WITH IMPENETRABLE CREVICES DEEP CAVES UNFATHOMABLE HOLES AT WHOSE FAR ENDS I COULD HEAR FEARSOME THINGS MOVING AROUND
HE STUDIED THE COMPASS AND PRESSURE GAUGE IN SILENCE THEN WENT AND PUT HIS FINGER ON THE WORLD MAP AT A SPOT IN THE SECTOR DEPICTING THE SOUTHERNMOST SEAS
BY THEN IT WAS 9:30
NOISES FROM DEEP UNDERNEATH CLEARLY TRANSMITTED BY THE LIQUID MEDIUM REVERBERATED WITH MAJESTIC AMPLITUDE
STUNNED AMAZEMENT WILL PROBABLY BE YOUR HABITUAL STATE OF MIND
BY THIS POINT EVERYTHING WAS FROZEN EVEN SOUND
BY THEN WE HAD FARED 4,860 LEAGUES FROM OUR STARTING POINT
THIS SHORTAGE OF WINE BREAD AND MEAT ISN'T SUITABLE FOR AN UPSTANDING ANGLO-SAXON A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO BEEFSTEAK AND UNFAZED BY REGULAR DOSES OF BRANDY OR GIN FOR MY PART CONSEIL THAT DOESN'T BOTHER ME IN THE LEAST AND I'VE ADJUSTED VERY NICELY TO THE DIET ON BOARD SO HAVE I CONSEIL REPLIED
SIMPLY TO DESTROY THEM
HE ASKED ME VERY GRACIOUSLY IF I FELT EXHAUSTED FROM OUR VIGIL THE NIGHT BEFORE
LATER CAPTAIN NEMO HAD HUNDREDS OF THEM HUNTED BECAUSE THEIR BLACK FLESH IS HIGHLY EDIBLE
FOR TWO MONTHS NOBODY HEARD A WORD ABOUT IT
ON ITS PLATFORM AND ON THE EMBANKMENT CREWMEN WERE BUSTLING AROUND BLACK SHADOWS THAT STOOD OUT CLEARLY IN THE MIDST OF THE LUMINOUS AIR
SAILOR AFTER SAILOR HEAVED INSULTS AT THE MONSTER WHICH COULDN'T BE BOTHERED WITH ANSWERING BACK
AT THIS POINT THE SORTERS BEGIN THEIR TWOFOLD TASK
ONE ODD DETAIL
ON FEBRUARY 5 WE FINALLY PUT INTO THE GULF OF ADEN A GENUINE FUNNEL STUCK INTO THE NECK OF BAB EL MANDEB AND BOTTLING THESE INDIAN WATERS IN THE RED SEA
STEAM RUSHED WHISTLING INTO THE GAPING VALVES
BY THEN THE SHORES OF AFRICA AND EUROPE WERE CONVERGING AND IN THIS NARROW SPACE COLLISIONS WERE COMMONPLACE
THE FURNITURE HAD BEEN KNOCKED OVER
THE HARPOONER WALKED IN THE LEAD AND DURING HIS STROLL THROUGH THIS FOREST HE GATHERED WITH SURE HANDS SOME EXCELLENT FRUIT THAT SHOULD HAVE COMPLETED HIS PROVISIONS
VOLCANOES WERE QUITE NUMEROUS IN THE WORLD'S EARLY DAYS BUT THEY'RE GOING EXTINCT ONE BY ONE
LIKE SO MANY OTHERS HE BEGAN WITH DIFFICULTIES AND SETBACKS BUT HE TRIUMPHED BECAUSE HE HAS THE VOLUNTEER SPIRIT
BY THEN IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
OUR VOYAGE IS JUST BEGINNING AND I'VE NO DESIRE TO DEPRIVE MYSELF SO SOON OF THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY EVEN SO CAPTAIN NEMO I WENT ON IGNORING HIS IRONIC TURN OF PHRASE THE NAUTILUS HAS RUN AGROUND AT A MOMENT WHEN THE SEA IS FULL
THEY WERE THE EYES OF GIGANTIC CRUSTACEANS CROUCHING IN THEIR LAIRS GIANT LOBSTERS REARING UP LIKE SPEAR CARRIERS AND MOVING THEIR CLAWS WITH A SCRAP-IRON CLANKING TITANIC CRABS AIMING THEIR BODIES LIKE CANNONS ON THEIR CARRIAGES AND HIDEOUS DEVILFISH INTERTWINING THEIR TENTACLES LIKE BUSHES OF WRITHING SNAKES
THE LIGHT TOOK ON A UNIFORM HUE
WE'LL TAKE NO PITY ON THESE FEROCIOUS CETACEANS
YES I REPEAT
DURING THIS WHOLE TIME OF LOW TIDE THE ISLANDERS LURKED NEAR THE NAUTILUS BUT THEY WEREN'T BOISTEROUS
THE NAUTILUS HAD JUST STARTED OFF AT GREAT SPEED
WHEN THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE PRESSURES ARE IN PERFECT BALANCE THEY NEUTRALIZE EACH OTHER AND ALLOW YOU TO TOLERATE THEM WITHOUT DISCOMFORT
WHERE WERE WE
WHERE WERE WE
I REENTERED MY STATEROOM
INDEED LARGER BLOCKS OF ICE SOON APPEARED THEIR BRILLIANCE VARYING AT THE WHIM OF THE MISTS
I RUSHED ONTO THE PLATFORM
FINALLY WE'RE UPRIGHT I EXCLAIMED
IT'S LOCATED BETWEEN LATITUDE 0 DEGREES 19 AND 10 DEGREES 2 SOUTH AND BETWEEN LONGITUDE 128 DEGREES 23 AND 146 DEGREES 15 AT NOON WHILE THE CHIEF OFFICER WAS TAKING THE SUN'S ALTITUDE I SPOTTED THE SUMMITS OF THE ARFAK MOUNTAINS RISING IN TERRACES AND ENDING IN SHARP PEAKS
I HAD NOW EARNED THE RIGHT TO PEN THE DEFINITIVE BOOK ON THE SEA AND SOONER OR LATER I WANTED THAT BOOK TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY
WAS IT AN EFFECT OF THE MOON'S RAYS
DOGFISH KNOWN AS TOPES TWELVE FEET LONG AND ESPECIALLY FEARED BY DIVERS WERE RACING WITH EACH OTHER
AT AROUND TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALL CONTACT WITH EUROPE BROKE OFF
AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ARMED WITH RIFLES AND AXES WE PULLED CLEAR OF THE NAUTILUS
AND HE SLIPPED AN OPEN CLASP KNIFE UNDER MY CLOTHES SLITTING THEM FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WITH ONE SWIFT STROKE
THE VARIOUS SCHOOLS OF THE OLD MASTERS WERE REPRESENTED BY A RAPHAEL MADONNA A VIRGIN BY LEONARDO DA VINCI A NYMPH BY CORREGGIO A WOMAN BY TITIAN AN ADORATION OF THE MAGI BY VERONESE AN ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN BY MURILLO A HOLBEIN PORTRAIT A MONK BY VELAZQUEZ A MARTYR BY RIBERA A VILLAGE FAIR BY RUBENS TWO FLEMISH LANDSCAPES BY TENIERS THREE LITTLE GENRE PAINTINGS BY GERARD DOW METSU AND PAUL POTTER TWO CANVASES BY GERICAULT AND PRUD'HON PLUS SEASCAPES BY BACKHUYSEN AND VERNET
I MEANT 150 PEARLS
I LOOKED BACK DOWN THE SIDE WE HAD JUST CLEARED
I FOUND IT EXCELLENT EVEN BETTER THAN VEAL IF NOT BEEF
BUT BELOW THE WAVES ABOARD THE NAUTILUS YOUR HEART NEVER FAILS YOU
NO BECAUSE THE NEW MOON WAS BARELY TWO DAYS OLD AND WAS STILL LOST BELOW THE HORIZON IN THE SUN'S RAYS
TRAVEL BETWEEN UPPER NORWAY AND THE SOUTH IS LIMITED
OUR EYES QUESTIONED EACH OTHER AND MORE DIRECTLY THAN IF OUR THOUGHTS HAD BEEN TRANSLATED INTO WORDS
IT WAS HORRIBLE
FROM THIS NEWS I DERIVED SOME PERSONAL ENLIGHTENMENT HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH SCIENCE
BARELY A FEW SPARSE FLOES SOME MOVING ICEBERGS
THEN HIS MEN SIMULTANEOUSLY STAKED IT OFF AT SEVERAL POINTS AROUND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE
THE DAY I EXPOUNDED THIS THEORY TO CAPTAIN NEMO HE ANSWERED ME COLDLY
ON THIS OCCASION CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME THAT HE INTENDED TO REACH THE INDIAN OCEAN VIA THE TORRES STRAIT
YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT VARIOUS ACCIDENTS CAUSED BY COLLISIONS WITH YOUR UNDERWATER MACHINE HAVE AROUSED PUBLIC PASSIONS ON THOSE TWO CONTINENTS
31 32 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS AT RANDOM
246 16
UNINJURED THE LATTER STOOD UP WENT RIGHT TO THE INDIAN QUICKLY CUT THE ROPE BINDING THE MAN TO HIS STONE TOOK THE FELLOW IN HIS ARMS AND WITH A VIGOROUS KICK OF THE HEEL ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
I COULDN'T CURB ITS PULSATIONS
HERE A QUESTION POPPED INTO MY HEAD
SO THE NAUTILUS WAS LYING ON ITS STARBOARD SIDE COMPLETELY STATIONARY TO BOOT
JUST FOR THE RECORD I'LL MENTION THOSE MEDITERRANEAN FISH THAT CONSEIL AND I BARELY GLIMPSED
FINALLY THE NATURALISTS OF ANTIQUITY MENTION SOME MONSTERS WITH MOUTHS AS BIG AS A GULF WHICH WERE TOO HUGE TO GET THROUGH THE STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR GOOD WORK MEN THE CANADIAN PUT IN
I MUSED ON ALL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SITUATION
THE SEXTANT WHICH TAKES THE SUN'S ALTITUDE AND TELLS ME MY LATITUDE
AND THEY WASTED THREE LONG WEEKS CROSSING THIS SECTOR
AT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE SKIES CAUGHT ON FIRE
BUT ONE CIRCUMSTANCE AROSE THAT DISPLAYED NED LAND'S MARVELOUS SKILLS AND SHOWED JUST HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE WE COULD PLACE IN HIM
IT DOESN'T HAVE A FORKED TAIL LIKE BALEEN WHALES OR SPERM WHALES AND ITS FINS LOOK LIKE SAWED-OFF LIMBS BUT IN THAT CASE I PUT IN
ON THIS INDIAN SHORE PROFESSOR THERE ARE ROADS AND RAILWAYS ENGLISH FRENCH AND HINDU VILLAGES
SPAIN HAD TO WITHSTAND THESE ALLIES
THE CHIEF OFFICER KEPT LIFTING HIS SPYGLASS AND STUBBORNLY EXAMINING THE HORIZON WALKING UP AND DOWN STAMPING HIS FOOT IN HIS NERVOUS AGITATION A SHARP CONTRAST TO HIS SUPERIOR
I CAN'T STAY HERE ANY LONGER
THE CANADIAN WAS QUITE DISHEARTENED HAVING COUNTED ON PUTTING HIS PLANS INTO EXECUTION IN THE GULF EITHER BY REACHING SHORE OR BY PULLING ALONGSIDE ONE OF THE MANY BOATS PLYING A COASTAL TRADE FROM ONE ISLAND TO ANOTHER
AS FOR MOLLUSKS THEY CONSISTED OF EXHIBITS I HAD ALREADY OBSERVED
INSIDE THE CORPSE OF ONE OF THESE ANIMALS THERE WERE FOUND A BUFFALO HEAD AND A WHOLE CALF
I'LL BE GLAD TO HAVE DONE IT BUT IN ORDER TO HAVE DONE IT IT HAS TO FINISH
SIDES TORN OPEN FUNNEL BENT PADDLE WHEELS STRIPPED TO THE MOUNTINGS RUDDER SEPARATED FROM THE STERNPOST AND STILL HANGING FROM AN IRON CHAIN THE BOARD ON ITS STERN EATEN AWAY BY MARINE SALTS
NEAR 11:30 THE BALLAST TANKS EMPTIED AND THE SUBMERSIBLE ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
NO FLAG WAS FLAPPING FROM THE GAFF OF ITS FORE-AND-AFT SAIL AND I COULDN'T TELL ITS NATIONALITY
NOW THEN RIGHT AT THIS SPOT THE SEA COVERS ENTIRE FORESTS THAT SANK UNDERWATER IN PREHISTORIC TIMES
NOTHING EXCEPT AN IMMENSENESS OF DESERTED WAVES
BY THIS POINT NED LAND HAD LOST ALL SELF-CONTROL
TWO OF HIS MEN CLIMBED ONTO THE WHALE'S FLANK AND TO MY ASTONISHMENT I SAW THEM DRAW FROM ITS UDDERS ALL THE MILK THEY HELD IN OTHER WORDS ENOUGH TO FILL TWO OR THREE CASKS
I'LL LET THE READER DECIDE WHETHER EYES GOT PROPER EXERCISE ABOARD THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
WHAT SHARP HISSES AND SNORTS UNIQUE TO THESE FRIGHTENED ANIMALS
GO ON BECAUSE IT JUST COULDN'T BE TRUE THE CANADIAN REPLIED UNCONSCIOUSLY ECHOING A FAMOUS CATCHPHRASE OF THE SCIENTIST ARAGO
THEN A LOWER COUNTERCURRENT THE ONLY PRESENT-DAY PROOF OF ITS EXISTENCE BEING LOGIC
YOUR CABIN IS WAITING FOR YOU I BOWED AND LETTING THE COMMANDER ATTEND TO GETTING UNDER WAY I WAS TAKEN TO THE CABIN THAT HAD BEEN SET ASIDE FOR ME
DURING ALL THOSE TIMES I'D THOUGHT HE WAS CONVALESCING IN THE GRIP OF SOME MISANTHROPIC FIT WAS HE INSTEAD FAR AWAY FROM THE SHIP INVOLVED IN SOME SECRET ACTIVITY WHOSE NATURE STILL ELUDED ME
I'VE BEEN STRUCK BY A LIGHTNING BOLT THESE WORDS EXPLAINED EVERYTHING TO ME
REENTERING THE LOUNGE I FIRST NOTED THE BEARINGS OF CEYLON ON WHICH ANTIQUITY LAVISHED SO MANY DIFFERENT NAMES
IN THIS WAY HE WOULD COMPLETE HIS UNDERWATER TOUR OF THE WORLD GOING BACK TO THOSE SEAS WHERE THE NAUTILUS ENJOYED THE GREATEST FREEDOM
THE ANNUAL HARVEST HASN'T YET BEGUN
WHATEVER HE HAD ONCE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF HUMANITY HE HAD NO RIGHT TO METE OUT SUCH PUNISHMENT
SOMETHING WAS OUT THERE THAT MUCH WAS CERTAIN AND ANY DOUBTING THOMAS WAS INVITED TO PLACE HIS FINGER ON THE SCOTIA'S WOUND
ON THE 28TH AT 77 DEGREES 32
HE WAS TALL HIS FOREHEAD BROAD HIS NOSE STRAIGHT HIS MOUTH CLEARLY ETCHED HIS TEETH MAGNIFICENT HIS HANDS REFINED TAPERED AND TO USE A WORD FROM PALMISTRY HIGHLY PSYCHIC IN OTHER WORDS WORTHY OF SERVING A LOFTY AND PASSIONATE SPIRIT
SO THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE
THE SEA UNDULATED PLACIDLY BENEATH THE FRIGATE'S STEMPOST
THE MOST ORDINARY GOOD SENSE WOULD FORBID HIM TO SET US FREE
THOSE PEARLS STAYING IN THE STRAINERS WITH TWENTY TO EIGHTY HOLES ARE IN THE FIRST ORDER
HAVE FAITH IN HIM AND SLEEP IN PEACE MASTER HAS NO NEED FOR MY SERVICES NO MY FRIEND
BUT ON THE 26TH APPEASED WITH GIFTS AND SEEING THAT THEY DIDN'T NEED TO FEAR ANY REPRISALS THE NATIVES LED THE CHIEF OFFICER MR JACQUINOT TO THE SITE OF THE SHIPWRECK
IT WAS INDEED THAT BYGONE ABODE OF PROTEUS THE OLD SHEPHERD OF KING NEPTUNE'S FLOCKS
ACCORDING TO HIS CALCULATIONS THIS FROZEN MASS ENCLOSING THE SOUTHERNMOST POLE FORMS A VAST ICE CAP WHOSE WIDTH MUST REACH 4,000 KILOMETERS
THE TINIEST SOUNDS WERE TRANSMITTED WITH A SPEED TO WHICH THE EAR IS UNACCUSTOMED ON SHORE
WHAT WAS THE BOND BETWEEN THESE HEROIC SOULS AND THE SOUL OF CAPTAIN NEMO
BETWEEN EUROPEANS AND SAVAGES IT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR EUROPEANS TO SHOOT BACK BUT NOT TO ATTACK FIRST
THEY BEAR NO GOVERNMENT SEAL OF APPROVAL BUT I IMAGINE THEY'RE NONE THE WORSE FOR IT ON THE CONTRARY JUST THEN CAPTAIN NEMO OPENED A DOOR FACING THE ONE BY WHICH I HAD ENTERED THE LIBRARY AND I PASSED INTO AN IMMENSE SPLENDIDLY LIT LOUNGE
DID I SAY SHARKS I EXCLAIMED HASTILY
IN 1791 JUSTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FATE OF THESE TWO SLOOPS OF WAR THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT FITTED OUT TWO LARGE CARGO BOATS THE SEARCH AND THE HOPE WHICH LEFT BREST ON SEPTEMBER 28 UNDER ORDERS FROM REAR ADMIRAL BRUNI D'ENTRECASTEAUX
THIS ENCOUNTER REMINDED ME THAT OTHER MORE DAUNTING ANIMALS MUST BE LURKING IN THESE DARK REACHES AND MY DIVING SUIT MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE PROTECTION AGAINST THEIR ATTACKS
THERE OUR DIVING SUITS WERE REMOVED NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
I HAD ONE QUESTION LEFT TO ADDRESS TO CAPTAIN NEMO
AT 3,200 FEET OR 100 TIMES GREATER PRESSURE IT'S 1,756,800 KILOGRAMS
NED PROMISED US CUTLETS WHICH SEEMS HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE TO ME SIR THE CANADIAN REPLIED OUR HUNTING NOT ONLY ISN'T OVER IT HASN'T EVEN STARTED
A MAGNIFICENT PLAIN OF WAVES PLOWED CONTINUOUSLY BY SHIPS OF EVERY NATION SHADED BY EVERY FLAG IN THE WORLD AND ENDING IN THOSE TWO DREADFUL HEADLANDS SO FEARED BY NAVIGATORS CAPE HORN AND THE CAPE OF TEMPESTS
ON JULY 4 1779 AS A MEMBER OF THE SQUADRON UNDER ADMIRAL D'ESTAING IT ASSISTED IN THE CAPTURE OF THE ISLAND OF GRENADA
MY BREATHING GREW WEAKER
IN MY EYES YOUR MODERN ARTISTS ARE ALREADY AS OLD AS THE ANCIENTS
THE LIGHTNING BOLTS OF CAPTAIN NEMO 117 23
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS SOME RUIN ENSHROUDED IN A CRUST OF WHITENED SEASHELLS AS IF UNDER A MANTLE OF SNOW
THE BATTLE BETWEEN SPERM WHALES AND BALEEN WHALES HAD ALREADY BEGUN WHEN THE NAUTILUS ARRIVED
THIS ORIGINAL CITY OF ATHENS NINETY CENTURIES OLD HAD BEEN INVADED AND PARTLY DESTROYED BY THE ATLANTEANS
AS I SAID THE NAUTILUS VEERED TO THE EAST
ULTIMATELY IT'S UNIMPORTANT
THEN LITTLE ONE-METER SHARKS THE HEAD LARGE THE SNOUT SHORT AND ROUNDED THE TEETH SHARP AND ARRANGED IN SEVERAL ROWS THE BODY SEEMINGLY COVERED WITH SCALES
DID CAPTAIN NEMO VIEW US WITH DISTRUST IN THESE HEAVILY TRAVELED SEAS OR DID HE SIMPLY WANT TO HIDE FROM THE SIGHT OF THOSE SHIPS OF EVERY NATION THAT PLOWED THE MEDITERRANEAN
HOBSON SECRETARY OF THE NAVY
WHAT HAPPENED TO MASTER CONSEIL ASKED VERY STARTLED
THEN LORD KNOWS WHY THEY WERE GRIPPED WITH A SUDDEN FEAR
NOW THEN ON MAY 25 WHILE SUBMERGED TO A DEPTH OF 3,836 METERS THE NAUTILUS LAY IN PRECISELY THE LOCALITY WHERE THIS SECOND CABLE SUFFERED THE RUPTURE THAT RUINED THE UNDERTAKING
THEN FOLLOWING THE CAPTAIN'S EXAMPLE I LET MYSELF BE CROWNED WITH MY HEAVY COPPER SPHERE AND OUR AIR TANKS IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO ACTION
HE'S FOUND HIMSELF A SEPARATE WORLD THAT SAVES ITS MOST ASTONISHING WONDERS JUST FOR HIM BUT WHERE ARE THE FISH THE CANADIAN VENTURED TO OBSERVE
AS FOR THE FOREGROUNDS PASSING BEFORE OUR EYES THEY WERE FANTASTICALLY CARVED ROCKS FORESTS OF TREES THAT HAD CROSSED OVER FROM THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM INTO THE MINERAL KINGDOM THEIR MOTIONLESS SILHOUETTES SPRAWLING BENEATH THE WAVES
THROUGH THE LOUNGE WINDOWS I COULD SEE LONG CREEPERS AND GIGANTIC FUCUS PLANTS BULB-BEARING SEAWEED OF WHICH THE OPEN SEA AT THE POLE HAD REVEALED A FEW SPECIMENS
ON FEBRUARY 8 AS EARLY AS THE FIRST HOURS OF DAYLIGHT MOCHA APPEARED BEFORE US
TWO MONTHS EARLIER WE WOULD HAVE ENJOYED PERPETUAL DAYLIGHT IN THIS LATITUDE
CHAPTER 2 A NEW PROPOSITION FROM CAPTAIN NEMO ON JANUARY 28 IN LATITUDE 9 DEGREES 4 NORTH WHEN THE NAUTILUS RETURNED AT NOON TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA IT LAY IN SIGHT OF LAND SOME EIGHT MILES TO THE WEST
THESE ISLANDS ARE CORAL FORMATIONS
THE COMPANY'S INVESTORS WERE LURED BY THE BAIT OF ENORMOUS GAINS BECAUSE THIS SCUTTLED TREASURE IS ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH 500,000,000 FRANCS IT WAS 500,000,000 FRANCS CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED BUT NO MORE RIGHT I SAID
NED LAND AND CONSEIL RETURNED TO THEIR CABIN
THIS ISLAND WHOSE SURFACE AREA MEASURES 1,625 SQUARE LEAGUES IS GOVERNED BY RAJAHS
IN FACT IT TAKES NO LESS THAN SIXTEEN DOZEN OF THESE HEADLESS MOLLUSKS TO SUPPLY THE 315 GRAMS THAT SATISFY ONE MAN'S MINIMUM DAILY REQUIREMENT FOR NITROGEN
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY SUPERVISION LEFT ON THE NAUTILUS
THE LAD WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD AND HIS AGE TO THAT OF HIS EMPLOYER WAS AS FIFTEEN IS TO TWENTY
BUT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE NAUTILUS ABOUT TEN METERS AWAY THERE ROSE DAZZLING WALLS OF ICE
HERE'S WHAT CAME TO PASS
EXPOSED TO THE OUTSIDE AIR THE THERMOMETER MARKED 2 DEGREES TO 3 DEGREES CENTIGRADE
UNKNOWN TO THE CREW I'VE STOWED SOME FOOD AND FLASKS OF WATER INSIDE I'M WITH YOU WHAT'S MORE THE CANADIAN ADDED IF THEY CATCH ME I'LL DEFEND MYSELF I'LL FIGHT TO THE DEATH THEN WE'LL DIE TOGETHER NED MY FRIEND MY MIND WAS MADE UP
FOR MY PART DESPITE THE HARPOONER'S CONFIDENT TALK I ADMIT THAT I ENTERTAINED NO ILLUSIONS
ALL AROUND US THIS FREEZE IS GAINING FAST HOW LONG I ASKED WILL THE OXYGEN IN THE AIR TANKS ENABLE US TO BREATHE ON BOARD THE CAPTAIN LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN THE LIKE
TWO CABLE LENGTHS OFF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S STARBOARD QUARTER THE SEA SEEMED TO BE LIT UP FROM UNDERNEATH
I HAD THOUGHT IT ALL OUT BUT TO NO AVAIL BECAUSE THE CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCED BY OUR BREATHING PERMEATED EVERY PART OF THE SHIP
AFTER SECURELY FASTENING THE CHEST CAPTAIN NEMO WROTE AN ADDRESS ON ITS LID IN CHARACTERS THAT MUST HAVE BEEN MODERN GREEK
IN THESE WIDE SEAS EMPTY OF ISLANDS IT WAS NO LONGER FEASIBLE TO JUMP SHIP
NED LAND WAS ALL FOR JUMPING OVERBOARD
AND AS FOR THEIR SPEECH IT'S UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT'S THE NUISANCE IN NOT KNOWING EVERY LANGUAGE CONSEIL REPLIED OR THE DRAWBACK IN NOT HAVING ONE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD ALL GO OUT THE WINDOW NED LAND REPLIED
BUT IN ALL THESE STORIES IS THERE ANY TRUTH CONSEIL ASKED
BUT JUST THEN I SAW THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY AS A LEAD-IN TO MY TOPIC
WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY THEY LIVED UP TO THEIR NICKNAMES OF BASKET SPONGES CHALICE SPONGES DISTAFF SPONGES ELKHORN SPONGES LION'S PAWS PEACOCK'S TAILS AND NEPTUNE'S GLOVES DESIGNATIONS BESTOWED ON THEM BY FISHERMEN MORE POETICALLY INCLINED THAN SCIENTISTS
BUT HOW WOULD HE RECEIVE OUR DEMANDS FOR FREEDOM
THESE WERE THE HISTORICAL MEMORIES THAT CAPTAIN NEMO'S SCRAWL SENT RUSHING THROUGH MY MIND
THE SKIFF APPROACHED CAUTIOUSLY TO WITHIN THREE FATHOMS OF THE ANIMAL
CONSEIL AND I STAYED NEXT TO EACH OTHER AS IF DAYDREAMING THAT THROUGH OUR METAL CARAPACES A LITTLE POLITE CONVERSATION MIGHT STILL BE POSSIBLE
THAT MAN NOW BURIED IN THE CORAL CEMETERY WASN'T HE THE VICTIM OF SOME COLLISION CAUSED BY THE NAUTILUS
SO IF THE BEAST DOES EXIST IT'S ALREADY LONG GONE I HAD NO REPLY TO THIS
FRANTIC I RUSHED INTO THE LIBRARY
THE NARROW HATCH HAD BARELY CLOSED OVER ME WHEN I WAS SURROUNDED BY PROFOUND DARKNESS
THIS TOXIC VEGETATION HAS INCREASED BENEATH THE SEAS OF THE TORRID ZONE SO THE DISEASE SPREADS UNCHECKED FROM THE MOUTH OF THE RIO DE LA PLATA TO FLORIDA AND IF PROFESSOR TOUSSENEL IS CORRECT THIS PLAGUE IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE SCOURGE THAT WILL STRIKE OUR DESCENDANTS ONCE THE SEAS ARE DEPOPULATED OF WHALES AND SEALS
THEIR LIMESTONE DEPOSITS BUILD UP INTO ROCKS REEFS ISLETS ISLANDS
MY MOUTH OPENED CONVULSIVELY FILLING WITH BRINE
THIS LAST ATTEMPT ULTIMATELY MISFIRING THE TWO STRANGERS EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS IN THEIR INCOMPREHENSIBLE LANGUAGE AND WITHDREW NOT EVEN FAVORING US WITH ONE OF THOSE ENCOURAGING GESTURES THAT ARE USED IN EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
CARRIED AWAY WITH ITS DRIVING POWER THE NAUTILUS HAD PASSED THROUGH THE VESSEL'S MASS LIKE A SAILMAKER'S NEEDLE THROUGH CANVAS
MADE OF SOLID IVORY WITHOUT STRIATIONS HARDER THAN ELEPHANT TUSKS AND LESS PRONE TO YELLOWING THESE TEETH ARE IN GREAT DEMAND
BUT THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER 4 ARRIVED WITH THIS UNDERWATER MYSTERY STILL UNSOLVED
I KNEW THIS MAN WAS DARING TO THE POINT OF BEING FOOLHARDY
THE SEA WAS OF MODERATE DEPTH
I DOUBT IT I REPLIED
AND NOW WE HAD ACTUALLY STARTED OUR RETURN JOURNEY
HOWEVER THIS DELICATE QUESTION WOULD HAVE TO BE NEGOTIATED WITH THE CAPTAIN
TWO HOURS LATER WE HAD COMPLETED A FULL CIRCLE AROUND IT
WE STOOD STOCK-STILL NOT KNOWING WHAT SURPRISE WAS WAITING FOR US WHETHER PLEASANT OR UNPLEASANT
CAPTAIN NEMO ENTERED BENEATH A DARK GALLERY WHOSE GENTLE SLOPE TOOK US TO A DEPTH OF 100 METERS
CONSEQUENTLY I HOPED THAT SOME CREWMEN WOULD SOON MAKE AN APPEARANCE
NED LAND AND CONSEIL WERE THERE WAITING FOR ME
LIKE MULBERRY TREES THEY REPRODUCE BY MEANS OF SHOOTS AND SEEDS
IN ANY EVENT PROFESSOR THESE BOOKS ARE AT YOUR DISPOSAL AND YOU MAY USE THEM FREELY I THANKED CAPTAIN NEMO AND APPROACHED THE SHELVES OF THIS LIBRARY
HE'S HAD A FIT THAT'S LASTED EIGHT DAYS AND ISN'T OVER EVEN YET
YOU OBSERVE CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME THAT I USE BUNSEN CELLS NOT RUHMKORFF CELLS
THE WATER GLUED THEM TO MY BODY THEY WERE PARALYZING MY MOVEMENTS
I ESTIMATE--BUT PERHAPS I'M MISTAKEN--THAT THE NAUTILUS'S HAPHAZARD COURSE CONTINUED FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY DAYS AND I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG THIS WOULD HAVE GONE ON WITHOUT THE CATASTROPHE THAT ENDED OUR VOYAGE
I STARED AT HIM
AT THE SURFACE THIS WATER GAVE A TEMPERATURE OF 12 DEGREES CENTIGRADE BUT NOW IT GAVE NO MORE THAN 10 DEGREES
I HEARD A DOOR WITH WATERTIGHT SEALS CLOSE AFTER US AND WE WERE SURROUNDED BY PROFOUND DARKNESS
IF THAT ENERGETIC MAN WAS ABLE TO THINK ABOUT HIS LIFE IN ITS LAST SECONDS IMAGINE WHAT HIS FINAL THOUGHTS MUST HAVE BEEN AS HE SPOKE CAPTAIN NEMO SEEMED DEEPLY MOVED AN EMOTION I FELT WAS TO HIS CREDIT
AFTER GOING DOWN A FAIRLY STEEP SLOPE OUR FEET TROD THE FLOOR OF A SORT OF CIRCULAR PIT
THAT DAY JANUARY 21 1868 THE CHIEF OFFICER WENT AT NOON TO TAKE THE SUN'S ALTITUDE
THE SKIFF HEADED SOUTHWARD
OUR ELECTRIC BULLETS ARE INEFFECTIVE AGAINST SUCH SOFT FLESH WHERE THEY DON'T MEET ENOUGH RESISTANCE TO GO OFF
FINE SO MUCH THE BETTER
SOME BIG DOGFISH ALSO PASSED BY A VORACIOUS SPECIES OF SHARK IF THERE EVER WAS ONE
IN WONDERMENT WE LEANED ON OUR ELBOWS BEFORE THESE SHOW WINDOWS AND OUR STUNNED SILENCE REMAINED UNBROKEN UNTIL CONSEIL SAID
THERE ARE SOME SHELLFISH THAT TURN INTO REAL JEWEL COFFERS
MAY I LEARN PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED ME I'VE SAID YOU'D BE FREE ABOARD MY VESSEL SO NO PART OF THE NAUTILUS IS OFF-LIMITS TO YOU
THE HUMAN MIND ENJOYS IMPRESSIVE VISIONS OF UNEARTHLY CREATURES
I WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEPLY INTERESTED IN VISITING THIS LONG 360-LEAGUE REEF AGAINST WHICH THE EVER-SURGING SEA BROKE WITH THE FEARSOME INTENSITY OF THUNDERCLAPS
BORINGS WILL TELL US THAT
I WAS WAITING
GO ON
SWALLOWING A FEW GULPS OF SALT WATER WHATEVER YOU SAY NED THEN TRYING TO IMITATE CAPTAIN NEMO'S CAREFREE TONE I ASKED BY THE WAY GALLANT NED ARE YOU AFRAID OF SHARKS ME THE CANADIAN REPLIED
OSPREYS ED
NO AN INCIDENT HE ANSWERED ME
THERE ARE TWO CURRENTS HERE
SO I HOPED HE WOULD NOW HUG THE COASTS OF EUROPE AND AMERICA WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE CANADIAN TO TRY AGAIN WITH A GREATER CHANCE OF SUCCESS
JUST THEN CAPTAIN NEMO STOPPED
BUT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WEAR AND TEAR WERE ALMOST NONEXISTENT
THE OTHERS WEAK AND AILING SET SAIL WITH THE COUNT DE LA PéROUSE
I WON'T COUNT THEM COUNT WHAT THOSE 11,000,000 EGGS
I HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS
PIERCED TO THE HEART IT WAS STRUGGLING WITH DREADFUL SPASMS WHOSE AFTERSHOCKS KNOCKED CONSEIL OFF HIS FEET
THEY'RE MERELY MOUTH AND TEETH MOUTH AND TEETH
MEANWHILE IGNORING ALL THESE FINE SPECIMENS OF PAPUAN FLORA THE CANADIAN PASSED UP THE DECORATIVE IN FAVOR OF THE FUNCTIONAL
ONLY THE SODIUM IS CONSUMED AND THE SEA ITSELF GIVES ME THAT
HIS PUPILS WERE HIDEOUSLY CONTRACTED
BUT HE DIDN'T SAY
LADYFINGERS ARE SMALL THIN WHITE CLOUDS WITH RAGGED EDGES
LADYFINGERS ARE SMALL THIN WHITE CLOUDS WITH RAGGED EDGES
SOME OF THESE WRECKED SHIPS HAD PERISHED IN COLLISIONS OTHERS FROM HITTING GRANITE REEFS
DON'T FLARE UP SO QUICKLY
BUT CAPTAIN NEMO DETAINED ME AND INVITED ME TO TAKE A SEAT NEXT TO HIM
IT MUST HAVE TASTED PRETTY BAD NED LAND ADDED
SEA ROBINS WHOSE LIVERS ARE THOUGHT TO BE POISONOUS
THESE ALGAE ARE A GENUINE PRODIGY OF CREATION ONE OF THE WONDERS OF WORLD FLORA
IT WAS A LIBRARY
AND WHEN THIS LIGHT CAME IN CONTACT WITH FLOWERS ROCKS BUDS SEASHELLS AND POLYPS THE EDGES OF THESE OBJECTS WERE SHADED WITH ALL SEVEN HUES OF THE SOLAR SPECTRUM
SUDDENLY A SLIGHT MOVEMENT COULD BE FELT OVER THE HULL
STRABO SAW IT USED FOR SHIPPING
THIS OUTRAGEOUS ANIMAL HAD TO SHOULDER RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL DERELICT VESSELS WHOSE NUMBERS ARE UNFORTUNATELY CONSIDERABLE SINCE OUT OF THOSE 3,000 SHIPS WHOSE LOSSES ARE RECORDED ANNUALLY AT THE MARINE INSURANCE BUREAU THE FIGURE FOR STEAM OR SAILING SHIPS SUPPOSEDLY LOST WITH ALL HANDS IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY NEWS AMOUNTS TO AT LEAST 200
THE LAST OF THESE IS AMPLY REPRESENTED BY THE FOUR ZOOPHYTE GROUPS THREE CLASSES OF ARTICULATES FIVE CLASSES OF MOLLUSKS AND THREE VERTEBRATE CLASSES
I'LL CHASE THAT ANIMAL TILL MY FRIGATE EXPLODES YES I REPLIED AND NOBODY WOULD BLAME YOU WE COULD STILL HOPE THAT THE ANIMAL WOULD TIRE OUT AND NOT BE AS INSENSITIVE TO EXHAUSTION AS OUR STEAM ENGINES
NEAR MIDNIGHT THE SEA SUDDENLY RESUMED ITS USUAL HUE BUT BEHIND US ALL THE WAY TO THE HORIZON THE SKIES KEPT MIRRORING THE WHITENESS OF THOSE WAVES AND FOR A GOOD WHILE SEEMED IMBUED WITH THE HAZY GLOW OF AN AURORA BOREALIS
HAVE YOU SEEN ENOUGH OF ITS HIDDEN WONDERS ITS FISH AND ZOOPHYTES ITS GARDENS OF SPONGES AND FORESTS OF CORAL
THEY HAVE BEEN QUITE APTLY DEFINED AS
SO THIS PROVED TO ME THAT SOME CONNECTION EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO SEAS
THEN HIS NERVES GREW CALMER HIS FACIAL FEATURES RECOVERED THEIR USUAL ICY COMPOSURE AND TURNING TO ME
THESE ORDERS WERE EXECUTED AND THE FRIGATE SWIFTLY RETREATED FROM THIS CORE OF LIGHT
HE WAS ONE OF YOUR GREAT SEAMEN THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME ONE OF YOUR SHREWDEST NAVIGATORS THAT D'URVILLE
THE MIST HAD CLEARED AND ON THAT DAY I HOPED OUR NOON SIGHTS COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED
IN THE MIDST OF THESE LUMINOUS SHEETS OF WATER I THEN GLIMPSED FLASHES OF LIGHT LIKE THOSE SEEN INSIDE A BLAZING FURNACE FROM STREAMS OF MOLTEN LEAD OR FROM MASSES OF METAL BROUGHT TO A WHITE HEAT--FLASHES SO INTENSE THAT CERTAIN AREAS OF THE LIGHT BECAME SHADOWS BY COMPARISON IN A FIERY SETTING FROM WHICH EVERY SHADOW SHOULD SEEMINGLY HAVE BEEN BANISHED
BUT IF MASTER SAYS SO CONSEIL TOLD HIM THEN SO BE IT WHAT'S MORE NED I SAID CAPTAIN NEMO HIMSELF DID THE HONORS IN HIS TUNNEL AND I STOOD BESIDE HIM IN THE PILOTHOUSE WHILE HE STEERED THE NAUTILUS THROUGH THAT NARROW PASSAGEWAY YOU HEAR NED CONSEIL SAID
THE NAUTILUS HAD CLEARED 8,100 MILES
THEN THE LEVEL OF THE OYSTERBANK WOULD LOWER UNPREDICTABLY
THE WIND'S BLOWING TOWARD SHORE
A LARGE BIRD WITH A WIDE WINGSPAN QUITE CLEARLY VISIBLE APPROACHED AND HOVERED OVER US
I THEN UNDERSTOOD CAPTAIN NEMO'S INTENT
ON BOTH SIDES I HAD WINDOWS OPENING OVER THESE UNEXPLORED DEPTHS
HE HAD SUBDUED PHYSICAL PAIN WITH MORAL STRENGTH
WE ARE HERE AND WE MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT I WAS HARD PRESSED BY NED LAND'S COMMON SENSE AND I FELT MYSELF LOSING GROUND
CAPTAIN NEMO STARED AT THEM FOR A FEW MOMENTS STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS TO THEM SANK TO HIS KNEES AND MELTED INTO SOBS
WHEN IT WAS JUST A FEW METERS ABOVE THE WAVES CAPTAIN NEMO'S COMPANION TOOK AIM AND FIRED
AFTER THAT THESE VILLAINOUS ATTEMPTS WERE NOT REPEATED
BECAUSE AS THAT TIME COVER STORY SUGGESTS WE STILL HAVEN'T CAUGHT UP WITH VERNE
BUT THERE HIS SCIENCE CAME TO A HALT
ME CONSEIL REPLIED
I'LL ONLY ASK YOU CAPTAIN
HAD I DISCOVERED WHO HE WAS WHERE HE CAME FROM WHERE HE WAS HEADING HOW DEEP HE WAS TAKING US
BECAUSE NEWFOUNDLAND IS SIMPLY AN UNDERWATER PEAK YOU COULD CALL THESE COD MOUNTAIN FISH
ABOVE BECAUSE THE ICE BANK'S UNDERBELLY SPREAD OVER US LIKE AN IMMENSE CEILING
A PIER IS A TYPE OF WHARF EXPRESSLY SET ASIDE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL VESSEL
A PIER IS A TYPE OF WHARF EXPRESSLY SET ASIDE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL VESSEL
AND I'LL MENTION--FOR THE RECORD--SOME LITTLE BANDED BLENNIES THAT FOLLOW SHIPS INTO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS SHARP-SNOUTED CARP EXCLUSIVE TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC SCORPIONFISH AND LASTLY THE GADOID FAMILY CHIEFLY THE COD SPECIES WHICH I DETECTED IN THEIR WATERS OF CHOICE OVER THESE INEXHAUSTIBLE GRAND BANKS
ARMS FOLDED BODIES CONTRACTED SHELLS TURNED OVER BY CHANGING THEIR CENTER OF GRAVITY AND THE WHOLE FLOTILLA DISAPPEARED UNDER THE WAVES
DAMNATION HE EXCLAIMED
DAMNATION HE EXCLAIMED
WHEN I TURNED AROUND I COULD STILL SEE THE NAUTILUS'S WHITISH BEACON WHICH WAS STARTING TO GROW PALE IN THE DISTANCE
BUT SINCE SALT WATER FREEZES ONLY AT 2 DEGREES I WAS FINALLY ASSURED THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF IT SOLIDIFYING
THE NAUTILUS DOESN'T NEED A HARBOR NO PROFESSOR BUT IT NEEDS ELECTRICITY TO RUN BATTERIES TO GENERATE ITS ELECTRICITY SODIUM TO FEED ITS BATTERIES COAL TO MAKE ITS SODIUM AND COALFIELDS FROM WHICH TO DIG ITS COAL
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THE DAY WAS WELL ALONG BUT A VERY DENSE MORNING MIST SHRANK THE HORIZON AND OUR BEST SPYGLASSES WERE UNABLE TO PIERCE IT
AT ONCE THE ENGINE STEPPED UP ITS DRIVE POWER SETTING THE PROPELLER IN SWIFTER ROTATION
I COULDN'T SLEEP
DID YOU HEAR MY QUESTION
BY VESSELS NAMED THE SOLWAY THE ISIS THE PARAMATTA THE HUNGARIAN THE CANADIAN THE ANGLO-SAXON THE HUMBOLDT AND THE UNITED STATES ALL RUN AGROUND
ICE ICE AND MORE ICE YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT NED I ANSWERED BUT I'M NOT
NED LAND COULDN'T CONCEAL HIS GLEE
FLOATING FLUSH WITH THE WATER THE NAUTILUS MOVED AHEAD AT A MODERATE PACE
MEANWHILE AS THE SUN GOT PROGRESSIVELY HIGHER IT LIT UP THE WATERY MASS MORE AND MORE
HIS FEATURES WERE ACCENTUATED TAKING ON SUPERHUMAN PROPORTIONS
IT WAS DESERTED
IT WAS DESERTED
IT WAS DESERTED
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE THESE VALUABLE REPTILES BECAUSE THEY WAKE UP AT THE SLIGHTEST SOUND AND THEIR SOLID CARAPACES ARE HARPOON-PROOF
HIS STEP WAS FIRM BUT LESS REGULAR THAN USUAL
HE USED TO TAKE PLEASURE IN EXPLAINING THE UNDERWATER WONDERS TO ME
IT WOULD BE MOST UNFORTUNATE IF SUCH A SECRET WERE TO DIE WITH ITS INVENTOR CAPTAIN NEMO DID NOT REPLY
IT'S CLEAR THAT THESE STRANGERS DON'T INTEND TO LET US DIE OF HUNGER OTHERWISE LAST EVENING'S DINNER WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE UNLESS THEY'RE FATTENING US UP NED SHOT BACK
WAS HE ONE OF THOSE UNAPPRECIATED SCHOLARS ONE OF THOSE GENIUSES EMBITTERED BY THE WORLD AS CONSEIL EXPRESSED IT A LATTER-DAY GALILEO OR MAYBE ONE OF THOSE MEN OF SCIENCE LIKE AMERICA'S COMMANDER MAURY WHOSE CAREERS WERE RUINED BY POLITICAL REVOLUTIONS
JUST THEN A STONE WHIZZED TOWARD US LANDED AT OUR FEET AND CUT SHORT THE HARPOONER'S PROPOSITION
I ASKED CAPTAIN NEMO IF HE HAD OBSERVED ANY FISH AT MORE CONSIDERABLE DEPTHS
RIGHT AWAY THE CANADIAN REPLIED
ICEBERGS OR MOUNTAINS
ONE OF THE SAILORS LED ME TO THE AFTERDECK WHERE I STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF A SMART-LOOKING OFFICER WHO EXTENDED HIS HAND TO ME
HE HELD MY HAND HE KEPT ENCOURAGING ME AND I EVEN HEARD HIM MUTTER
AWAY WENT ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING TO THE LANDING PLACES OF NEW YORK OR THE ST LAWRENCE
JUST THEN THE DUGOUT CANOES DREW NEARER TO THE NAUTILUS AND A CLOUD OF ARROWS BURST OVER US
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE BEACON HAD GONE BACK ON AND WAS CASTING ITS ELECTRIC LIGHT INTO THE LIQUID MASS
ARE WE UP TO PRESSURE HE ASKED THE MAN
HE CROSSED HIS ARMS
I COULD MAKE OUT ONLY ITS WOODED MOUNTAINS ON THE HORIZON BECAUSE CAPTAIN NEMO HATED TO HUG SHORE
WHAT WAS THE SECRET BEHIND THIS UNDERWATER NAVIGATING WHOSE EXPLANATION THE WHOLE WORLD HAD SOUGHT IN VAIN
THE DEEPEST PARTS OF THE OCEAN ARE TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO US
NED LAND KNEW HOW TO HANDLE THESE TREES
WHAT'S THIS TALK ABOUT DOUBLING THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE BUT UNLESS THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATES ON DRY LAND AND CROSSES OVER THE ISTHMUS OR UNDER IT PROFESSOR ARONNAX UNDER IT SURELY CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED SERENELY
THE SEA IS SIMPLY THE VEHICLE FOR A PRODIGIOUS UNEARTHLY MODE OF EXISTENCE
THE NUTS GAVE WAY AND RIPPED OUT OF ITS SOCKET THE SKIFF WAS HURLED LIKE A STONE FROM A SLING INTO THE MIDST OF THE VORTEX
NEAR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THIS AGONIZING SENSATION AFFECTED ME TO AN INTENSE DEGREE
THE TOTIPALMES FULLY WEBBED FAMILY WAS REPRESENTED BY SWIFT FRIGATE BIRDS NIMBLY CATCHING FISH AT THE SURFACE AND BY NUMEROUS TROPIC BIRDS OF THE GENUS PHAETON AMONG OTHERS THE RED-TAILED TROPIC BIRD THE SIZE OF A PIGEON ITS WHITE PLUMAGE SHADED WITH PINK TINTS THAT CONTRASTED WITH ITS DARK-HUED WINGS
I OWED IT TO YOU THE GHOST OF A SMILE GLIDED ACROSS THE CAPTAIN'S LIPS AND THAT WAS ALL
FINALLY CAPTAIN NEMO REGAINED HIS SELF-CONTROL
MEANWHILE BRISKLY UNCONCERNED THE NAUTILUS RAN AT FULL PROPELLER THROUGH THE MIDST OF THESE RUINS
I WAS OBSERVING THE STATE OF THE SEA UNDER THESE CONDITIONS AND EVEN THE LARGEST FISH WERE NOTHING MORE THAN ILL-DEFINED SHADOWS WHEN THE NAUTILUS WAS SUDDENLY TRANSFERRED INTO BROAD DAYLIGHT
AMONG THE TRIANGULAR TYPE I NOTICED SOME HALF A DECIMETER LONG WITH BROWN TAILS YELLOW FINS AND WHOLESOME EXQUISITELY TASTY FLESH
NOT A BOAT NOT A DIVER
WE'LL DO IT THIS EVENING HE SAID
SINCE HE MADE NO ALLUSION TO HIS ABSENCE THE PAST EIGHT DAYS I ALSO REFRAINED FROM MENTIONING IT AND I SIMPLY ANSWERED THAT MY COMPANIONS AND I WERE READY TO GO WITH HIM
IT SOON VANISHED INTO THE SHADOWS
FROM THE BRANCH MOLLUSCA HE MENTIONS NUMEROUS COMB-SHAPED SCALLOPS HOOFLIKE SPINY OYSTERS PILED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER TRIANGULAR COQUINA THREE-PRONGED GLASS SNAILS WITH YELLOW FINS AND TRANSPARENT SHELLS ORANGE SNAILS FROM THE GENUS PLEUROBRANCHUS THAT LOOKED LIKE EGGS SPOTTED OR SPECKLED WITH GREENISH DOTS MEMBERS OF THE GENUS APLYSIA ALSO KNOWN BY THE NAME SEA HARES OTHER SEA HARES FROM THE GENUS DOLABELLA PLUMP PAPER-BUBBLE SHELLS UMBRELLA SHELLS EXCLUSIVE TO THE MEDITERRANEAN ABALONE WHOSE SHELL PRODUCES A MOTHER-OF-PEARL MUCH IN DEMAND PILGRIM SCALLOPS SADDLE SHELLS THAT DINERS IN THE FRENCH PROVINCE OF LANGUEDOC ARE SAID TO LIKE BETTER THAN OYSTERS SOME OF THOSE COCKLESHELLS SO DEAR TO THE CITIZENS OF MARSEILLES FAT WHITE VENUS SHELLS THAT ARE AMONG THE CLAMS SO ABUNDANT OFF THE COASTS OF NORTH AMERICA AND EATEN IN SUCH QUANTITIES BY NEW YORKERS VARIOUSLY COLORED COMB SHELLS WITH GILL COVERS BURROWING DATE MUSSELS WITH A PEPPERY FLAVOR I RELISH FURROWED HEART
ON THE OFFCHANCE THAT THE ANIMAL MIGHT BE FOUND IN THESE WATERWAYS A THOUSAND METHODS WERE USED TO SPARK ITS INTEREST OR ROUSE IT FROM ITS APATHY
IT'S THE FAITHFUL RECORD OF THIS INCONCEIVABLE EXPEDITION INTO AN ELEMENT NOW BEYOND HUMAN REACH BUT WHERE PROGRESS WILL SOMEDAY MAKE GREAT INROADS
ARRIVING UNDER THE STOVES WIRES TRANSMITTED TO PLATINUM GRIDDLES A HEAT THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED AND SUSTAINED WITH PERFECT CONSISTENCY
APPARENTLY CAPTAIN NEMO HAD GIVEN THIS ORDER AT THE SAME TIME HE COMMANDED THE NAUTILUS TO PICK UP SPEED
MY MISTAKE
CONSEIL STATIONED BESIDE ME STARED STRAIGHT AHEAD
I CREPT FORWARD THROUGH THE NAUTILUS'S DARK GANGWAYS PAUSING AFTER EACH STEP TO CURB THE POUNDING OF MY HEART
AS THE ANCIENTS WERE WONT TO DO IT WAS DYED WITH PURPLE INK FROM THE MUREX SNAIL AND SHADED WITH VIOLET TINTS THAT I EXTRACT FROM A MARINE SLUG THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA HARE
WHAT AN INDESCRIBABLE SIGHT AND WHAT A VARIETY OF SETTINGS AND SCENERY WHERE THESE REEFS AND VOLCANIC ISLANDS LEVELED OFF BY THE LIBYAN COAST
OH DAMNATION NED LAND SHOUTED STAMPING HIS FOOT ON THE RESONANT SHEET IRON
AND IN HIS FORESTS ON CRESPO ISLAND CONSEIL ADDED
MUCH TO NED LAND'S DISPLEASURE CAPTAIN NEMO HAD NO LIKING FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BRAZIL'S POPULOUS SHORES BECAUSE HE SHOT BY WITH DIZZYING SPEED
TODAY IS JANUARY 4 AND IN FIVE DAYS THE MOON WILL BE FULL
THEY NUMBERED IN THE MILLIONS
YES CAPTAIN NEMO SAID HEADING TO THE LOUNGE DOOR
BRAVO THREE TIMES OVER CAPTAIN
WHAT YOUR D'URVILLE DID ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME I'VE DONE IN THE OCEAN'S INTERIOR BUT MORE EASILY MORE COMPLETELY THAN HE
I WAS SINKING
WHAT A PREDICAMENT
I SAW IT THROUGH THE MISTS JUST THIS MORNING TWENTY MILES TO THE EAST WHAT LAND IS IT I'VE NO IDEA BUT WHATEVER IT IS THERE WE'LL TAKE REFUGE YES NED
IT WAS A HUGE QUADRILATERAL WITH CANTED CORNERS TEN METERS LONG SIX WIDE FIVE HIGH
THE NATIVES GAVE THE CASTAWAYS A FAIR ENOUGH WELCOME
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO NED LAND GOT DOWN TO THE IMPORTANT BUSINESS OF DINNER
I STARED AT THE CAPTAIN
AS IF AT A SIGNAL EVERY SAIL WAS ABRUPTLY LOWERED
I HELD MY HEAD IN BOTH HANDS TO KEEP IT FROM BURSTING
BUT FOR A GOOD WHILE I KEPT DREAMING AWAY UNTIL THE MOMENT MY EYES FOCUSED ON THE INSTRUMENTS HANGING ON THE WALL
COMPLAINING DOESN'T HAVE TO DO GOOD IT JUST FEELS GOOD
I GOT UP AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
THAT INDIAN PROFESSOR LIVES IN THE LAND OF THE OPPRESSED AND I AM TO THIS DAY AND WILL BE UNTIL MY LAST BREATH A NATIVE OF THAT SAME LAND CHAPTER 4 THE RED SEA DURING THE DAY OF JANUARY 29 THE ISLAND OF CEYLON DISAPPEARED BELOW THE HORIZON AND AT A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES PER HOUR THE NAUTILUS GLIDED INTO THE LABYRINTHINE CHANNELS THAT SEPARATE THE MALDIVE AND LACCADIVE ISLANDS
WOW NED LAND EXCLAIMED
HERE I'M NATURALLY LED INTO TELLING YOU HOW THE NAUTILUS IS MANEUVERED I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT IN ORDER TO STEER THIS BOAT TO PORT OR STARBOARD IN SHORT TO MAKE TURNS ON A HORIZONTAL PLANE I USE AN ORDINARY WIDE-BLADED RUDDER THAT'S FASTENED TO THE REAR OF THE STERNPOST AND WORKED BY A WHEEL AND TACKLE
JUST THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS EQUALLY IN THE BERING STRAIT AND THE DAVIS STRAIT SO THE SOUTHERN RIGHT WHALE IS STILL UNKNOWN TO YOU
SO AT THIRTY-TWO FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE SEA YOU'LL UNDERGO A PRESSURE OF 17,568 KILOGRAMS
AMONG OTHER ZOOPHYTES THERE WERE PORTUGUESE MEN-OF-WAR KNOWN BY THE NAME PHYSALIA PELAGICA LIKE BIG OBLONG BLADDERS WITH A PEARLY SHEEN SPREADING THEIR MEMBRANES TO THE WIND LETTING THEIR BLUE TENTACLES DRIFT LIKE SILKEN THREADS
WHEN THIS WAS DONE CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS MEN STOOD UP
I COULD FEEL THE PENETRATING FORCE OF THE STEEL SPUR
AND THE PASSING YEARS WILL SOMEDAY BEAR OUT MAURY'S OTHER VIEW THAT BY COLLECTING IN THIS WAY OVER THE CENTURIES THESE SUBSTANCES WILL BE TURNED TO STONE BY THE ACTION OF THE WATERS AND WILL THEN FORM INEXHAUSTIBLE COALFIELDS
OUR PATH IS BARRED TO THE SOUTH I ASKED HIM
BUT IT WOULD BE LESS WORK TO BELIEVE ME
ONLY THE CAPTAIN WENT ON I URGE YOU TO AIM CAREFULLY AT THIS ANIMAL IN YOUR OWN PERSONAL INTEREST IS THE DUGONG DANGEROUS TO ATTACK I ASKED DESPITE THE CANADIAN'S SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS
THEN THERA SANK UNDER THE WAVES ONLY TO RISE AND SINK ONCE MORE IN THE YEAR 69 A.D
THESE ATLANTEANS HE SAID RESIDED ON AN IMMENSE CONTINENT GREATER THAN AFRICA AND ASIA COMBINED TAKING IN AN AREA THAT LAY BETWEEN LATITUDE 12 DEGREES AND 40 DEGREES NORTH
FRENCH FISHERMEN GIVE THEM THE NAME CUCKOLDFISH AND THEY BELONG TO THE CLASS CEPHALOPODA FAMILY DIBRANCHIATA CONSISTING OF THEMSELVES TOGETHER WITH CUTTLEFISH AND ARGONAUTS
THE NAUTILUS DREW NEAR WAILEA BAY AN UNLUCKY PLACE FOR ENGLAND'S CAPTAIN DILLON WHO WAS THE FIRST TO SHED LIGHT ON THE LONGSTANDING MYSTERY SURROUNDING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SHIPS UNDER THE COUNT DE LA PéROUSE
AND MASTER'S BABIRUSA WOULD BE ENSCONCED IN ITS CAGE AT THE ZOO IN THE BOTANICAL GARDENS AND IT WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED EVERY CURIOSITY SEEKER IN TOWN QUITE SO CONSEIL AND WHAT'S MORE I IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WILL SOON BE POKING FUN AT US TO BE SURE CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY I DO THINK THEY'LL HAVE FUN AT MASTER'S EXPENSE
AN EXCELLENT LONGBOAT LIGHT AND UNSINKABLE WHICH IS USED FOR EXCURSIONS AND FISHING TRIPS BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO SET OUT DON'T YOU HAVE TO RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA BY NO MEANS
COULD A MORE FRIGHTENING NAME HAVE RUNG IN OUR EARS UNDER MORE FRIGHTENING CIRCUMSTANCES
PRIMO THE ACANTHOPTERYGIANS WHOSE UPPER JAW IS FULLY FORMED AND FREE-MOVING AND WHOSE GILLS TAKE THE SHAPE OF A COMB
RESTING ON SHORE THEY ASSUMED EXTREMELY GRACEFUL POSITIONS
NO TRANSOCEANIC NAVIGATIONAL UNDERTAKING HAS BEEN CONDUCTED WITH MORE ABILITY NO BUSINESS DEALINGS HAVE BEEN CROWNED WITH GREATER SUCCESS
ITS NAKED WALLS DIDN'T REVEAL ANY TRACE OF A DOOR OR WINDOW
AS LONG AS I COULD DENY THE REALITY OF THE BUSINESS I CONFINED MYSELF TO A FLAT NO COMMENT BUT SOON PINNED TO THE WALL I HAD TO EXPLAIN MYSELF STRAIGHT OUT
MASTER MAY RECALL CONSEIL THEN SAID THAT WE HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH SWIMMING
AN EXCITABLE CONCHOLOGIST WOULD SURELY HAVE FAINTED DEAD AWAY BEFORE OTHER MORE NUMEROUS GLASS CASES IN WHICH WERE CLASSIFIED SPECIMENS FROM THE MOLLUSK BRANCH
HEAVY CLOUDS PASSED ABOVE US FORMING AND FADING SWIFTLY
EVEN SO I CHERISHED NO HOPES THAT THE MAN WOULD SET US FREE
TWO RINGDOVES ROUNDED OUT THIS EXTRAORDINARY MENU
AND EVEN AT OUR MAXIMUM SPEED IT TOOK THE LIBERTY OF THUMBING ITS NOSE AT THE FRIGATE BY RUNNING A FULL CIRCLE AROUND US
IT LACKED ONLY THE CHARM OF CONVERSATION
THESE WERE THE SAME WATERWAYS WHERE CAPTAIN DENHAM ABOARD THE HERALD PAYED OUT 14,000 METERS OF SOUNDING LINE WITHOUT FINDING BOTTOM
MY AGITATION INCREASED
IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT CALCULATIONS THIS REDUCTION IS ONLY 0000436 PER ATMOSPHERE OR PER EVERY THIRTY FEET OF DEPTH
GOING ALONG THE 55TH MERIDIAN THE NAUTILUS CUT THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE ON MARCH 16 NEAR EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
INSTEAD FROM SOME INEXPLICABLE WHIM HE DECIDED TO BRAVE IT OUT ON THE SURFACE
OUR NOON SIGHTS WERE STILL LACKING
WHAT SWARMS BAH
IN THIS INSTANCE THE REDUCTION WOULD BE 00436
NOT AT ALL MY BOY
SO IN CONCLUSION I WISH MASTER TO HAVE WHATEVER HIS HEART DESIRES THANK YOU CONSEIL
IT WAS THE TIDE MERELY THE TIDE WHICH WELLNIGH CAUGHT US BY SURPRISE JUST AS IT DID SIR WALTER SCOTT'S HERO
THE SOUTH POLE 236 15
I TURNED AND DISCOVERED THE CAPTAIN
WE WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS WE HAD TO BE QUITE CLOSE TO SUEZ
TO THE SOUTH TEN MILES FROM THE NAUTILUS A SOLITARY ISLET ROSE TO A HEIGHT OF 200 METERS
HERE IN THIS VERY PLACE THOSE GALLEONS CARRYING TREASURE TO THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAD GONE TO THE BOTTOM
MORE IN COMMAND OF HIMSELF CAPTAIN NEMO REMAINED COOL
BUT I CONFESS THAT MY CURIOSITY IS AROUSED TO THE LIMIT BY THIS NAUTILUS THE MOTOR POWER IT CONTAINS THE EQUIPMENT ENABLING IT TO OPERATE THE ULTRA POWERFUL FORCE THAT BRINGS IT TO LIFE
THE NAUTILUS SWIFTLY RETREATED PUTTING US OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF THE VESSEL'S SHELLS
WHAT KEPT MY STOMACH IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD I'M UNABLE TO SAY
IT'S THE HEARTLAND OF THE BLACKS WHO OCCUPY ALL MALAYSIA MR DE RIENZI HAS SAID
NO SIR HE ANSWERED ME BUT WE'LL DISCOVER IT TOGETHER
HARDLY A BILLOW
LISTEN TO ME
CAPTAIN NEMO I TOLD MY HOST WHO HAD JUST STRETCHED OUT ON A COUCH THIS IS A LIBRARY THAT WOULD DO CREDIT TO MORE THAN ONE CONTINENTAL PALACE AND I TRULY MARVEL TO THINK IT CAN GO WITH YOU INTO THE DEEPEST SEAS WHERE COULD ONE FIND GREATER SILENCE OR SOLITUDE PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED
HOW MANY SHIPS HAVE PERISHED IN THESE WATERWAYS AS THEY TRIED TO GET DIRECTIONS FROM THE HAZY LIGHTS ON THE COAST
UNLOCKING NOISES BECAME AUDIBLE A DOOR OPENED AND TWO MEN APPEARED
THERE I SAW NUMEROUS IRON UNDERSIDES THE PHANTASMAGORIC RUINS OF STEAMERS SOME LYING DOWN OTHERS REARING UP LIKE FEARSOME ANIMALS
ACCORDINGLY MY EYES SOON CLOSED BEHIND THEIR HEAVY GLASS WINDOWS AND I FELL INTO AN UNCONTROLLABLE DOZE WHICH UNTIL THEN I HAD BEEN ABLE TO FIGHT OFF ONLY THROUGH THE MOVEMENTS OF OUR WALKING
NOON HE SAID
DO YOU THINK I'LL SEND YOU BACK TO A WORLD THAT MUST KNOW NOTHING MORE OF ME
THERE WERE WHITISH EELS OF THE SPECIES GYMNOTUS FASCIATUS THAT PASSED LIKE ELUSIVE WISPS OF STEAM CONGER EELS THREE TO FOUR METERS LONG THAT WERE TRICKED OUT IN GREEN BLUE AND YELLOW THREE-FOOT HAKE WITH A LIVER THAT MAKES A DAINTY MORSEL WORMFISH DRIFTING LIKE THIN SEAWEED SEA ROBINS THAT POETS CALL LYREFISH AND SEAMEN PIPERS AND WHOSE SNOUTS HAVE TWO JAGGED TRIANGULAR PLATES SHAPED LIKE OLD HOMER'S LYRE SWALLOWFISH SWIMMING AS FAST AS THE BIRD THEY'RE NAMED AFTER REDHEADED GROUPERS WHOSE DORSAL FINS ARE TRIMMED WITH FILAMENTS SOME SHAD SPOTTED WITH BLACK GRAY BROWN BLUE YELLOW AND GREEN THAT ACTUALLY RESPOND TO TINKLING HANDBELLS SPLENDID DIAMOND-SHAPED TURBOT THAT WERE LIKE AQUATIC PHEASANTS WITH YELLOWISH FINS STIPPLED IN BROWN AND THE LEFT TOPSIDE MOSTLY MARBLED IN BROWN AND YELLOW FINALLY SCHOOLS OF WONDERFUL RED MULLET REAL OCEANIC BIRDS OF PARADISE THAT ANCIENT ROMANS BOUGHT FOR AS MUCH AS 10,000 SESTERCES APIECE AND WHICH THEY KILLED AT THE TABLE SO THEY
BUT IT WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE TO SAY THAT WE SAT IN THE LOUNGE AS IF WE WERE RIDING IN A COACH ON AN EXPRESS TRAIN
A CATACLYSM OCCURRED--FLOODS EARTHQUAKES
I SPENT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE DAY ON THE PLATFORM
STOKE YOUR FURNACES AND CLAP ON FULL STEAM THREE CHEERS GREETED THIS ORDER
JETS OF LIQUID RISING LIKE HUNDREDS OF MAGNIFICENT BOUQUETS
WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO SAYING THAT THE AIR CONTAINED IN THE NAUTILUS WOULD BE EXACTLY ENOUGH FOR 625 MEN OVER TWENTY-FOUR HOURS 625 NED REPEATED
AND COULD MASTER TELL US THE PROFITS BROUGHT IN BY HARVESTING THESE BANKS OF PEARL OYSTERS ACCORDING TO SIRR'S BOOK I REPLIED THESE CEYLON FISHERIES ARE FARMED ANNUALLY FOR A TOTAL PROFIT OF 3,000,000 MAN-EATERS FRANCS CONSEIL REBUKED
OUR LIGHTS PRODUCED A THOUSAND DELIGHTFUL EFFECTS WHILE PLAYING OVER THESE BRIGHTLY COLORED BOUGHS
SAVE POLAND'S BORDERS ED
SCUM THE CAPTAIN SHOUTED
ARE YOU CLEAR ON THE CHAIN OF EVENTS CAPTAIN NEMO ASKED ME
VERY EASILY I RELATED TO HIM WHAT THE FINAL DEEDS OF CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE HAD BROUGHT TO LIGHT DEEDS DESCRIBED HERE IN THIS HEAVILY CONDENSED SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE MATTER
ASK IT PROFESSOR BY WHAT NAME AM I TO CALL YOU SIR THE COMMANDER REPLIED TO YOU I'M SIMPLY CAPTAIN NEMO TO ME YOU AND YOUR COMPANIONS ARE SIMPLY PASSENGERS ON THE NAUTILUS LATIN
WE MUST BE ABLE TO STEER RIGHT OR LEFT UP OR DOWN
THEY WANTED TO BE TAKEN TO A SPANISH PORT IF NOT TO CADIZ THEN TO THE BAY OF VIGO LOCATED ON SPAIN'S NORTHWEST COAST AND NOT BLOCKADED
NOW LOOK AT THAT CLOCK
IT WAS LIKE A STILL-ERECT COALFIELD ITS ROOTS CLUTCHING BROKEN SOIL ITS BOUGHS CLEARLY OUTLINED AGAINST THE CEILING OF THE WATERS LIKE THIN BLACK PAPER CUTOUTS
TO FACE A FREQUENTLY RAGING SEA IN A FRAIL SKIFF WAS A RACE TO CERTAIN DISASTER
I DID SO
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE THEIR EYES
WHEN I STOOD UP I SAW CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS CHIEF OFFICER ON THE PLATFORM
A LENGTH OF 35 METERS
IN FOUR MINUTES IT HAD CLEARED THE FOUR VERTICAL LEAGUES SEPARATING IT FROM THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN AND AFTER EMERGING LIKE A FLYING FISH IT FELL BACK INTO THE SEA MAKING THE WAVES LEAP TO PRODIGIOUS HEIGHTS
AMONG THE NAUTILUS'S CREW ALLIED BODY AND SOUL WITH CAPTAIN NEMO AND LIKEWISE FLEEING FROM HUMAN CONTACT I HAD FOUND A FELLOW COUNTRYMAN
JUST THEN THE DOOR TO THE MAIN LOUNGE OPENED AND CAPTAIN NEMO APPEARED
JUST THEN CONSEIL AND THE CANADIAN ENTERED WITH A CALM EVEN GLEEFUL AIR
WITH TWO VIGOROUS KICKS OF THE HEEL I CAME BACK TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
FROM WHERE WE STOOD THE SKY WAS PRETTY EASY TO SEE AND I WATCHED CLOUDS RACE BY DISHEVELED BY THE WEST WIND LETTING TATTERS OF MIST TRAIL OVER THE MOUNTAIN'S SUMMIT
WE'LL STAY HERE LONG ENOUGH TO LOAD IT ON BOARD IN OTHER WORDS A SINGLE WORKDAY THEN WE'LL RESUME OUR VOYAGE
THE COMPASS WHICH STEERS MY COURSE
IT LIKEWISE HUGGED KILTAN ISLAND A SHORE OF MADREPORIC ORIGIN DISCOVERED BY VASCO DA GAMA IN 1499 AND ONE OF NINETEEN CHIEF ISLANDS IN THE ISLAND GROUP OF THE LACCADIVES LOCATED BETWEEN LATITUDE 10 DEGREES AND 14 DEGREES 30 NORTH AND BETWEEN LONGITUDE 50 DEGREES 72 AND 69 DEGREES EAST
THE INSTRUMENT INDICATED A DEPTH OF 6,000 METERS
THE SQUID'S FEARSOME BEAK WAS WIDE OPEN OVER NED LAND
A RARE SPECIES WHOSE VERY EXISTENCE WAS STILL DOUBTED IN LACéPèDE'S DAY SINCE THAT PIONEERING CLASSIFIER OF FISH HAD SEEN ONE ONLY IN A PORTFOLIO OF JAPANESE DRAWINGS
I WAS IN THE GRIP OF ANGUISHED HALLUCINATIONS
THEN TURNING TO HIS COMPANION HE CONVERSED WITH HIM IN A LANGUAGE I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
THERE WAS A MIGHTY EXPLOSION MINGLED WITH CHEERS FROM THE CREW
IN PARIS ITS ENGINE BY KRUPP IN PRUSSIA ITS SPUR BY THE MOTALA WORKSHOPS IN SWEDEN ITS PRECISION INSTRUMENTS BY HART BROS
AT DINNER THE SAME DAY MY STEWARD SERVED ME SOME SLICES OF THIS FLESH SKILLFULLY DRESSED BY THE SHIP'S COOK
I WENT TO BED
QUIET COMMANDER FARRAGUT SAID
SET IN THE CABIN'S WALLS WERE FOUR DEADLIGHTS WINDOWS OF BICONVEX GLASS THAT ENABLED THE MAN AT THE HELM TO SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
THE CIVILIZED WORLD HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD
I STUDIED IN LONDON PARIS AND NEW YORK BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN I WAS A RESIDENT OF THE EARTH'S CONTINENTS BUT HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO BUILD THIS WONDERFUL NAUTILUS IN SECRET EACH PART OF IT PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAME FROM A DIFFERENT SPOT ON THE GLOBE AND REACHED ME AT A COVER ADDRESS
BUT THEY HAD TO SHARE THEIR DOMINION WITH HUGE HERDS OF MARINE MAMMALS THAT LOOKED AT US WITH GENTLE EYES
CEREBRAL INFLAMMATION WAS COMPLETE AND HAD BROUGHT ON A PARALYSIS OF MOVEMENT AND SENSATION
CAPTAIN NEMO ARMS CROSSED OVER HIS CHEST KNELT IN A POSTURE OF PRAYER AS DID ALL THE FRIENDS OF HIM WHO HAD LOVED THEM
ORDINARILY I NEVER ASKED WHETHER OR NOT IT SUITED HIM TO GO WITH ME ON MY JOURNEYS
AT EVERY THRUST NED LAND'S HARPOON WOULD PLUNGE INTO A SQUID'S SEA-GREEN EYE AND BURST IT
WRITTEN IN EVERY LANGUAGE BOOKS ON SCIENCE ETHICS AND LITERATURE WERE THERE IN ABUNDANCE BUT I DIDN'T SEE A SINGLE WORK ON ECONOMICS THEY SEEMED TO BE STRICTLY BANNED ON BOARD
THE SUN'S DISK LIKE A BALL OF FIRE ALREADY CUT INTO BY THE EDGE OF THE HORIZON
A STRUGGLE OF THE ELEMENTS WAS APPROACHING
RAISING HIS SEXTANT CAPTAIN NEMO TOOK THE ALTITUDE OF THE SUN WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM HIS LATITUDE
HAD HE FIGURED IN THE RECENT POLITICAL OR SOCIAL UPHEAVALS OF THIS CENTURY
I SEE NO REASON TO PREVENT THEM
AND JUST THINK HOW WE'LL DEVOUR ALL THIS MEAT OURSELVES WHILE THOSE NUMBSKULLS ON BOARD WON'T GET A SHRED IN HIS UNCONTROLLABLE GLEE I THINK THE CANADIAN MIGHT HAVE SLAUGHTERED THE WHOLE HORDE IF HE HADN'T BEEN SO BUSY TALKING
JUST THEN THE PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED WE WERE NO MORE THAN TWENTY FEET FROM THE SURFACE
HE HAD ALREADY EATEN IT ON HIS MANY VOYAGES AND KNEW HOW TO COOK ITS EDIBLE SUBSTANCE
THIS MAN LEAPED FORWARD TO INTERCEPT THE BLOW
ON JANUARY 25 THE OCEAN BEING COMPLETELY DESERTED THE NAUTILUS SPENT THE DAY ON THE SURFACE CHURNING THE WAVES WITH ITS POWERFUL PROPELLER AND MAKING THEM SPURT TO GREAT HEIGHTS
HAS THE SEA YIELDED UP SOME NOVEL SECRET TO YOU WE WERE MILES APART
ALL THESE IDEAS AND A THOUSAND OTHERS ASSAULTED ME AT THE SAME TIME
AND PLENTY GOOD FOR US NED LAND SHOT BACK
I'VE PORED OVER IT
IT WAS DIVIDED BY FUNCTION INTO TWO PARTS
THESE CLOTHES CONSISTED OF JACKET AND PANTS
BY THAT TIME CAPTAIN NEMO WILL BE LOCKED IN HIS ROOM AND PROBABLY IN BED
THE LIQUID MASSES SUPPORT THE LARGEST KNOWN SPECIES OF MAMMALS AND PERHAPS CONCEAL MOLLUSKS OF INCOMPARABLE SIZE OR CRUSTACEANS TOO FRIGHTFUL TO CONTEMPLATE SUCH AS 100-METER LOBSTERS OR CRABS WEIGHING 200 METRIC TONS
ITS OBLONG BODY ENDED IN A VERY LONG CAUDAL FIN AND ITS LATERAL FINS IN ACTUAL FINGERS
WHO EVER HEARD OF SUCH MALARKEY
I WANTED TO AVOID THE CAPTAIN TO HIDE FROM HIS EYES THE AGITATION OVERWHELMING ME
NED LAND TAPPED THESE WALLS AND TRIED TO PROBE THEIR THICKNESS
YOU'RE ILL-ADVISED TO PASS JUDGMENT ON ME SIR
IT'LL BE CLOUDY TONIGHT
AT THIS POINT THE PROPELLER'S VIBRATIONS SLOWED DOWN APPRECIABLY THEN THEY DIED OUT ALTOGETHER
NORTH OR SOUTH
SOME CREWMEN WERE AT THEIR LAST GASP
DILLON GUESSED THAT THE SHIPS AT ISSUE WERE THOSE UNDER THE COUNT DE LA PéROUSE SHIPS WHOSE DISAPPEARANCE HAD SHAKEN THE ENTIRE WORLD
BORN IN THE FRENCH RIVER TOWN OF NANTES VERNE HAD A LIFELONG PASSION FOR THE SEA
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS RIFT IN THE CLOUDS THE CHIEF OFFICER TOOK THE ORB'S ALTITUDE
THIS ET CETERA WON'T KEEP ME FROM MENTIONING ONE MORE FISH THAT CONSEIL WITH GOOD REASON WILL LONG REMEMBER
MY EYES NEVER LEFT THE CAPTAIN
HALF AN HOUR HAD ALREADY GONE BY WITHOUT OUR SITUATION CHANGING WHEN OUR EYES WERE SUDDENLY SPIRITED FROM UTTER DARKNESS INTO BLINDING LIGHT
CONSEIL DID THEM IN A FLASH AND I WAS SURE THE LAD HADN'T MISSED A THING BECAUSE HE CLASSIFIED SHIRTS AND SUITS AS EXPERTLY AS BIRDS AND MAMMALS
THE CAMERA WAS AIMED AT THE SCENERY ON THE OCEAN FLOOR AND IN A FEW SECONDS WE HAD A PERFECT NEGATIVE
NED LAND STARED AT CAPTAIN NEMO AND OBVIOUSLY MISSED HIS MEANING
THE THERMOMETER INDICATED A TEMPERATURE OF 4.25 DEGREES CENTIGRADE WHICH AT THIS DEPTH SEEMED TO BE A TEMPERATURE COMMON TO ALL LATITUDES
SIR I TOLD THE CAPTAIN THANK YOU FOR PLACING THIS LIBRARY AT MY DISPOSAL
THIS MAN WAS CERTAINLY THE MOST WONDERFUL PHYSICAL SPECIMEN I HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED
THIS OPERATION WAS SWIFTLY EXECUTED BECAUSE THE FRESH ICE WAS STILL THIN
THEIR UNDULATING FLIGHT THE GRACE OF THEIR AERIAL CURVES AND THE PLAY OF THEIR COLORS ALLURED AND DELIGHTED THE EYE
LATER I REVIEWED MY NARRATIVE
I COULDN'T RAISE THEM
YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS OUR SITUATION HAD BECOME UNTENABLE
NOW WE KNOW NED SAID THAT WE CAN'T EXPECT A THING FROM THIS MAN
AND IN ALL HONESTY I CONFESS THAT THIS VENTURESOME EXCURSION WAS FAR FROM DISPLEASING TO ME
PERHAPS YOU'LL ENCOUNTER THEM WHEN WE REACH EL TUR HENCE CAPTAIN NEMO THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE RED SEA ABOARD THE NAUTILUS NO SIR THEN SINCE YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THE CROSSING OF THE ISRAELITES AND THE CATASTROPHE THAT BEFELL THE EGYPTIANS I WOULD ASK IF YOU'VE EVER DISCOVERED ANY TRACES UNDER THE WATERS OF THAT GREAT HISTORIC EVENT NO PROFESSOR AND FOR AN EXCELLENT REASON WHAT'S THAT IT'S BECAUSE THAT SAME LOCALITY WHERE MOSES CROSSED WITH ALL HIS PEOPLE IS NOW SO CLOGGED WITH SAND CAMELS CAN BARELY GET THEIR LEGS WET
I WAS LAGGING BEHIND SOME TWENTY PACES WHEN I SAW CAPTAIN NEMO SUDDENLY COME BACK TOWARD ME
THE COUNTRY WHOSE REALITY HAS NEVERTHELESS BEEN ACCEPTED BY SUCH OTHER THINKERS AS POSIDONIUS PLINY AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS TERTULLIAN ENGEL SCHERER TOURNEFORT BUFFON AND D'AVEZAC
GRUNTS ON WHICH GOLD AND SILVER MINGLE THEIR LUSTER WITH THAT OF RUBY AND TOPAZ
BUT THE BASE OF THESE HIGH WALLS CONSISTED OF BROKEN SOIL OVER WHICH THERE LAY PICTURESQUE PILES OF VOLCANIC BLOCKS AND ENORMOUS PUMICE STONES
ENGINEER HE CALLED KEEP THE PRESSURE MOUNTING NED LAND MADE HIS WAY TO HIS POST
I WROTE UP MY NOTES UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
THE FRIGATE CONSEIL REPLIED ROLLING OVER ON HIS BACK
THE FAMILY DELPHINIA NUMBERS TEN GENERA AND THE DOLPHINS I SAW WERE AKIN TO THE GENUS DELPHINORHYNCHUS REMARKABLE FOR AN EXTREMELY NARROW MUZZLE FOUR TIMES AS LONG AS THE CRANIUM
NEVERTHELESS HE DIDN'T WASTE AN INSTANT
SUDDENLY CONSEIL'S VOICE STARTLED ME AWAKE
THEN HE LEFT VANIKORO HEADED TOWARD NEW ZEALAND DROPPED ANCHOR AT CALCUTTA ON APRIL 7 1828 AND RETURNED TO FRANCE WHERE HE RECEIVED A VERY CORDIAL WELCOME FROM KING CHARLES X
CHAPTER 9 THE TANTRUMS OF NED LAND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG THIS SLUMBER LASTED
NED LAND OBSERVED THE SEA WITH HIS PENETRATING EYES
UNABLE TO COMPETE WITH THE MONSTER'S SPEED THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN SLOWED DOWN AND STAYED AT HALF STEAM
OUR SKIFF REJOINED IT TOOK IT IN TOW AND HEADED TO THE NAUTILUS
THE AIR COULDN'T BE RENEWED IN THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR
MY HEART WAS POUNDING AT THE THOUGHT THAT OUR PLANS MIGHT BE DISCOVERED BEFORE WE HAD LEFT THE NAUTILUS AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING HAULED IN FRONT OF CAPTAIN NEMO AND FINDING HIM ANGERED OR WORSE SADDENED BY MY DESERTING HIM
AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING FULL OF UNEASINESS I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
SIRR NED AND CONSEIL TOOK SEATS ON A COUCH AND RIGHT OFF THE CANADIAN SAID TO ME
PLEASE GRANT ME A PARDON AS I'VE ALREADY GRANTED ONE TO MR LAND AND ON THE SAME GROUNDS
BUT COMMANDER FARRAGUT WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO GO FORTH
EVERY MAN BY VIRTUE OF HIS VERY HUMANITY DESERVES FAIR TREATMENT
I OFTEN WONDERED WHY HE TOOK THESE OBSERVATIONS
IT SCRAMBLES UP TREES ON THE BEACH AND SENDS THE COCONUTS TUMBLING
SO IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HURRY AND EMPTY THE GALLEONS BEFORE THE ALLIED FLEETS ARRIVED AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMPLE TIME FOR THIS UNLOADING IF A WRETCHED QUESTION OF TRADE AGREEMENTS HADN'T SUDDENLY COME UP
THEN AS SPECIMENS OF OTHER GENERA BLOWFISH RESEMBLING A DARK BROWN EGG FURROWED WITH WHITE BANDS AND LACKING TAILS
I HOVERED IN THAT PAINFUL STATE THAT PREDOMINATES DURING THE PERIOD OF ANTICIPATION BEFORE SOME FRIGHTFUL EXPLOSION
SOLID MATTER HAD WRESTED FROM LIQUID MATTER SOME 37,657,000 SQUARE MILES HENCE 12,916,000,000 HECTARES
THERE IN KING NEPTUNE'S DOMAIN BY KARPATHOS HIS SPOKESMAN IS AZURE-HUED PROTEUS ED
WHEN I INFORMED YOU THAT IT WAS AN ISSUE OF UNDERWATER FORESTS YOU THOUGHT I'D GONE INSANE
BEFORE INSERTING MY HEAD INTO ITS COPPER CAPSULE I COMMENTED ON THIS TO THE CAPTAIN
MY FINGERS GAVE OUT
SEVERAL OF YOUR SCIENTIFIC COLLEAGUES TOOK THEIR DEGREES IN MEDICINE SUCH AS GRATIOLET MOQUIN-TANDON AND OTHERS THAT'S RIGHT I SAID I AM A DOCTOR I USED TO BE ON CALL AT THE HOSPITALS
SO HE TOLD THE HARPOONER
THERE I SAW AGAIN BUT NOT YET PRESSED AND DRIED LIKE THE NAUTILUS'S SPECIMENS SOME PEACOCK'S TAILS SPREAD OPEN LIKE FANS TO STIR UP A COOLING BREEZE SCARLET ROSETANGLE SEA TANGLE STRETCHING OUT THEIR YOUNG AND EDIBLE SHOOTS TWISTING STRINGS OF KELP FROM THE GENUS NEREOCYSTIS THAT BLOOMED TO A HEIGHT OF FIFTEEN METERS BOUQUETS OF MERMAID'S CUPS WHOSE STEMS GREW WIDER AT THE TOP AND A NUMBER OF OTHER OPEN-SEA PLANTS ALL WITHOUT FLOWERS
BUT WHAT'S WRONG MY BOY I'VE BEEN DAZZLED STRUCK BLIND INVOLUNTARILY MY EYES FLEW TO THE WINDOW BUT I COULDN'T STAND THE FIRE DEVOURING IT
IN THE CENTER STOOD A HUGE TABLE COVERED WITH PAMPHLETS AMONG WHICH SOME NEWSPAPERS LONG OUT OF DATE WERE VISIBLE
BIRDS NESTED IN THE YOUNG TREES
THE SPHERICAL ONES ARE MADE INTO BRACELETS
SOME ZOOPHYTES WERE DREDGED UP BY THE CHAIN OF OUR TRAWL
BY THEN THE NAUTILUS HAD RETURNED TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
THE NAUTILUS EASILY AVOIDED THE MONEY BREAKERS TO PORT AND THE VICTORIA REEFS TO STARBOARD POSITIONED AT LONGITUDE 130 DEGREES ON THE TENTH PARALLEL WHICH WE WENT ALONG RIGOROUSLY
AT RANDOM
THE SCOTIA'S ACCIDENT WAS UNDENIABLE
PROFESSOR THIS STRANGE MAN THEN SAID YOU MUST EXCUSE THE INFORMALITY WITH WHICH I RECEIVE YOU AND THE DISORDER REIGNING IN THIS LOUNGE SIR I REPLIED WITHOUT PRYING INTO WHO YOU ARE MIGHT I VENTURE TO IDENTIFY YOU AS AN ARTIST A COLLECTOR SIR NOTHING MORE
YES SIR
YES SIR
YES SIR
YES SIR
I'VE TAKEN SUCH OBSERVATIONS HE TOLD ME AND I CAN VOUCH FOR THEIR RELIABILITY FINE I REPLIED BUT THE NAUTILUS LIVES IN A SEPARATE WORLD AND THE SECRETS OF ITS SCIENTISTS DON'T MAKE THEIR WAY ASHORE YOU'RE RIGHT PROFESSOR HE TOLD ME AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF SILENCE
THE AIR WAS STREAKED WITH VIOLENT FLASHES OF LIGHTNING
BUT COMMANDER FARRAGUT WAS UNWILLING TO ATTEMPT THIS TORTUOUS PASSAGEWAY AND MANEUVERED INSTEAD TO DOUBLE CAPE HORN
WHAT THINK YOU I THINK WE'RE TRAPPED CAPTAIN TRAPPED
THE PANTS ENDED IN BULKY FOOTWEAR ADORNED WITH HEAVY LEAD SOLES
THE BEAST WEIGHED 5,000 KILOGRAMS
WE MUST UNDERSTAND HIM
THE MANATEES LET THEMSELVES BE STRUCK DOWN WITHOUT OFFERING ANY RESISTANCE
THERE ARE NO OBSTACLES FOR US
IT ALSO HEATED A DISTILLING MECHANISM THAT VIA EVAPORATION SUPPLIED EXCELLENT DRINKING WATER
AND I DON'T THINK THE CANADIAN SAID THAT YOUR NEMO WOULD OBJECT TO US STASHING A CARGO OF COCONUTS ABOARD HIS VESSEL I IMAGINE NOT I REPLIED BUT HE WON'T WANT TO SAMPLE THEM TOO BAD FOR HIM CONSEIL SAID
WHILE HE WAS TAKING HIS SIGHTS HE DIDN'T MOVE A MUSCLE AND THE INSTRUMENT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN STEADIER IN HANDS MADE OUT OF MARBLE
HE WAS A PRISONER ESCAPING FROM PRISON AND NEVER DREAMING HE WOULD NEED TO REENTER IT
HERE'S WHAT I FOUND AT THE VERY SITE OF THAT FINAL SHIPWRECK CAPTAIN NEMO SHOWED ME A TIN BOX STAMPED WITH THE COAT OF ARMS OF FRANCE AND ALL CORRODED BY SALT WATER
THEIR HAZY TRANSPARENCY WAS NOTHING MORE THAN DROWNED LIGHT
HE OBSERVED IT A GOOD WHILE
SINCE I PREFER NEVER TO USE VIOLENCE I EXPECT FROM YOU IN SUCH A CASE EVEN MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER YOUR UNQUESTIONING OBEDIENCE
FINALLY AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING ON THAT MEMORABLE DAY OF MARCH 19 THE LOUNGE DOOR OPENED
WHO KNOWS WHERE THE WINDS WILL TAKE THAT CONTRIVANCE INTO WHOSE HANDS IT MAY FALL
ONE AFTER ANOTHER REPORTS ARRIVED THAT WOULD PROFOUNDLY AFFECT PUBLIC OPINION
WE HAD EVERY KNOWN MECHANISM FROM THE HAND-HURLED HARPOON TO THE BLUNDERBUSS FIRING BARBED ARROWS TO THE DUCK GUN WITH EXPLODING BULLETS
THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE DIDN'T OPEN
SHOWERS OF SPARKS AND CINDERS OF FLAMING COAL ESCAPED FROM ITS FUNNELS SPANGLING THE AIR WITH STARS
ITS PLATING CAN'T GIVE WAY
I FELT SURE IT DID SO INEXHAUSTIBLE IS THIS SERIES OF UNDERWATER WONDERS
FROM NOW ON WE'LL PAY CLOSER ATTENTION TO EM BUT I WENT ON FOR SECRETING PEARLS THE IDEAL MOLLUSK IS THE PEARL OYSTER MELEAGRINA MARGARITIFERA THAT VALUABLE SHELLFISH
ITS BALLAST TANKS FULL IT WAS SITTING AT A DEPTH OF 1,000 METERS IN A COMPARATIVELY UNPOPULATED REGION OF THE OCEAN WHERE ONLY LARGER FISH PUT IN OCCASIONAL APPEARANCES
SO I SUMMONED CONSEIL WHO BROUGHT ME A SMALL LIGHT DRAGNET SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN OYSTER FISHING
BUT A SLIDING SOUND BECAME AUDIBLE
THE DAY YOU'RE READY ALERT US AND WE'RE WITH YOU
FISHING BOOTS OTTER CAP COAT OF FAN-MUSSEL FABRIC LINED WITH SEALSKIN
I CAN'T EXPRESS THE INTENSITY OF MY AMAZEMENT AT THE BEAUTIES OF THESE NEW REGIONS
YOU MAY INSPECT IT IN DETAIL AND I'LL BE DELIGHTED TO ACT AS YOUR GUIDE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU SIR BUT I WON'T ABUSE YOUR GOOD NATURE
THEN ONE MAY SMOKE ON BOARD SURELY IN THAT CASE SIR I'M FORCED TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE KEPT UP RELATIONS WITH HAVANA NONE WHATEVER THE CAPTAIN REPLIED
SPEAK JUST FOR ME STRICTLY ON MY BEHALF IF YOU WANT BUT I RARELY ENCOUNTER HIM
THEN IN A CALMER TONE
AS IF HE COULD PROBE YOUR VERY SOUL
NED LAND WHO PROMPTLY REAPPEARED AFTER WE HUGGED SHORE NEVER STOPPED QUESTIONING ME
I REALIZED THAT IT WAS LETTING THE WARSHIP APPROACH
WHEN THE SUN APPEARED FOR AN INSTANT NEAR NOON CAPTAIN NEMO TOOK A REASONABLY ACCURATE SIGHT THAT GAVE OUR POSITION AS LONGITUDE 51 DEGREES 30 AND LATITUDE 67 DEGREES 39 SOUTH
SAVAGES HEAD FOR THE SKIFF I SAID MOVING TOWARD THE SEA
FOR AN INSTANT I THOUGHT THE POOR MAN ENTWINED BY THE DEVILFISH MIGHT BE TORN LOOSE FROM ITS POWERFUL SUCTION
THE LATTER INTERRUPTED HIS STROLLING AND AIMED HIS SPYGLASS AT THE POINT INDICATED
AND POISONED HAIL PERHAPS WE'VE GOT TO ALERT CAPTAIN NEMO I SAID REENTERING THE HATCH
ONLY SOME GOVERNMENT COULD OWN SUCH AN ENGINE OF DESTRUCTION AND IN THESE DISASTER-FILLED TIMES WHEN MEN TAX THEIR INGENUITY TO BUILD INCREASINGLY POWERFUL AGGRESSIVE WEAPONS IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT UNKNOWN TO THE REST OF THE WORLD SOME NATION COULD HAVE BEEN TESTING SUCH A FEARSOME MACHINE
BUT A CANADIAN'S WIT IS HALF FRENCH AND MR NED LAND MADE THIS CLEAR IN HIS REPLY
I THEN EXAMINED THE FITTINGS OF THIS MECHANISM WHOSE POWER WAS INCREASED A HUNDREDFOLD BY BICONVEX LENSES THAT WERE DESIGNED LIKE THOSE IN A LIGHTHOUSE AND KEPT ITS RAYS PRODUCTIVELY FOCUSED
ON MARCH 14 AT LATITUDE 55 DEGREES I SPOTTED FLOATING ICE PLAIN PALE BITS OF RUBBLE TWENTY TO TWENTY-FIVE FEET LONG WHICH FORMED REEFS OVER WHICH THE SEA BURST INTO FOAM
THE OARSMEN TOOK THEIR TIME
LET'S WAIT FOR NIGHTFALL NIGHT FELL
THEN HE BEGAN HIS DESCRIPTION AS FOLLOWS
WITH ALL THE SPEED THEIR STILTLIKE LEGS COULD MUSTER FINE FAT BUSTARDS SCAMPERED OVER THE SLOPES
I STARED IN GENUINE WONDERMENT AT THIS ROOM SO INGENIOUSLY LAID OUT AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES
THEY WERE PORTRAITS OF GREAT MEN OF HISTORY WHO HAD SPENT THEIR LIVES IN PERPETUAL DEVOTION TO A GREAT HUMAN IDEAL
BUT HE DIDN'T APPEAR
MY COMPANIONS AND I HAD NO TIME TO COLLECT OURSELVES
A STEWARD IS A WAITER ON BOARD A STEAMER
A STEWARD IS A WAITER ON BOARD A STEAMER
BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO GIVE AS GOOD AS I GOT
ITS BREATH IS CLEAN AND HEALTHY
HIS SHIP AND HE WERE ONE
FAIRLY FLAT TO THE EAST IT SWELLED A LITTLE TOWARD THE SOUTH
AND ABOVE ALL WHAT MUST HE HAVE THOUGHT WHEN CAPTAIN NEMO PULLED A BAG OF PEARLS FROM A POCKET IN HIS DIVING SUIT AND PLACED IT IN THE FISHERMAN'S HANDS
HOW COULD I RELINQUISH THIS OCEAN--"MY OWN ATLANTIC AS I LIKED TO CALL IT--WITHOUT OBSERVING ITS LOWER STRATA WITHOUT WRESTING FROM IT THE KINDS OF SECRETS THAT HAD BEEN REVEALED TO ME BY THE SEAS OF THE EAST INDIES AND THE PACIFIC
HERE AND THERE CHRYSANTHEMUMS SPROUTED TIMIDLY AT THE FEET OF ALOES WITH LONG SAD SICKLY LEAVES
SOON HE HAD FORGOTTEN MY PRESENCE AND WAS LOST IN A REVERIE THAT I NO LONGER TRIED TO DISPEL
I TRIED TO INTERVENE ONE LAST TIME
A SEA STRETCHING INTO THE DISTANCE
THE CANADIAN BANGED A TABLE WITH HIS FEARSOME FIST
AS DISCOVERED BY COMMANDER MAURY THE TRUE SOURCE OF THE GULF STREAM ITS STARTING POINT IF YOU PREFER IS LOCATED IN THE BAY OF BISCAY
BUT AFTER ALL AS CONSEIL NOTED WE ENJOYED COMPLETE FREEDOM WE WERE DAINTILY AND ABUNDANTLY FED
BUT WHAT DOES NED LAND THINK ABOUT ALL THIS NED LAND'S THOUGHTS ARE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF MINE CONSEIL REPLIED
CAPTAIN NEMO REJOINED ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE VERTICAL CURRENTS WHICH ARE CAUSED BY DIFFERENCES IN THE WATER'S SALINITY AND DENSITY CAN PRODUCE ENOUGH MOTION TO SUSTAIN THE RUDIMENTARY LIFESTYLES OF SEA LILIES AND STARFISH TRUE THE CAPTAIN PUT IN
BUT THERE WAS NO QUESTION NOW
THAT KINDLY LIGHT REKINDLED OUR STRENGTH
THESE POLYPS GROW EXCLUSIVELY IN THE AGITATED STRATA AT THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND SO IT'S IN THE UPPER REACHES THAT THEY BEGIN THESE SUBSTRUCTURES WHICH SINK LITTLE BY LITTLE TOGETHER WITH THE SECRETED RUBBLE BINDING THEM
PIERRE ARONNAX PROFESSOR AT THE PARIS MUSEUM FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL NEW YORK SIR
THEN HERE'S HOW TO CALCULATE IT I REPLIED
WE WERE ROCKING FRIGHTFULLY
WITHOUT IT I WOULDN'T HAVE VENTURED TODAY INTO SUCH A BLIND ALLEY AS THE RED SEA LATIN
THEY WERE MANEUVERED BY SKILLFUL HALF-NAKED PADDLERS AND I VIEWED THEIR ADVANCE WITH DEFINITE ALARM
THERE SIR ALL UNDER CONTROL HE TOLD ME AFTER A FEW MOMENTS
ENGINES FORWARD COMMANDER FARRAGUT CALLED
CONSEIL KEPT STILL
OFTEN WE WENT AROUND TALL POINTED ROCKS RISING LIKE PYRAMIDS
COULDN'T MASTER PERSUADE HIS FRIEND CAPTAIN NEMO TO SEND THE THREE OF US ASHORE IF ONLY SO OUR FEET DON'T LOSE THE KNACK OF TREADING ON THE SOLID PARTS OF OUR PLANET I CAN ASK HIM I REPLIED BUT HE'LL REFUSE LET MASTER TAKE THE RISK CONSEIL SAID AND WE'LL KNOW WHERE WE STAND ON THE CAPTAIN'S AFFABILITY MUCH TO MY SURPRISE CAPTAIN NEMO GAVE ME THE PERMISSION I ASKED FOR AND HE DID SO WITH GRACE AND ALACRITY NOT EVEN EXACTING MY PROMISE TO RETURN ON BOARD
WE'RE CERTAINLY SEEING SOME UNUSUAL THINGS AND FOR TWO MONTHS WE'VE HAD NO TIME FOR BOREDOM
THE FALKLAND ISLANDS WERE PROBABLY DISCOVERED BY THE FAMOUS NAVIGATOR JOHN DAVIS WHO GAVE THEM THE NAME DAVIS SOUTHERN ISLANDS
PERHAPS THESE GENTLEMEN WILL GRASP A FEW WORDS OF IT I TRIED AGAIN TELLING THE TALE OF OUR ADVENTURES CLEARLY ARTICULATING MY EVERY SYLLABLE AND NOT LEAVING OUT A SINGLE DETAIL
IS IT DEEPLY FASCINATING THIS VOLUME MASTER IS READING TREMENDOUSLY FASCINATING I REPLIED
THEY BOARDED TWO SLOOPS OF WAR THE COMPASS AND THE ASTROLABE WHICH WERE NEVER SEEN AGAIN
I THINK MASTER HAD BEST NOT DEPEND ON IT TO ANY GREAT EXTENT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING I'M SAYING THAT JUST AS I JUMPED OVERBOARD I HEARD THE MEN AT THE HELM SHOUT OUR PROPELLER AND RUDDER ARE SMASHED SMASHED YES SMASHED BY THE MONSTER'S TUSK
IT WAS LIKELY THAT THEY HAD COME FROM NEIGHBORING ISLANDS OR FROM THE MAINLAND OF PAPUA PROPER
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT FISH MAKE UP THE FOURTH AND LAST CLASS IN THE VERTEBRATE BRANCH
WE KNOW THAT MOVING CREATURES CAN STILL BE ENCOUNTERED WHERE WATER PLANTS NO LONGER GROW
SOME OF THESE TEETH HAVE BEEN FOUND BURIED IN THE BODIES OF BALEEN WHALES WHICH THE NARWHALE ATTACKS WITH INVARIABLE SUCCESS
THE HUNTERS HAD COUNTED ON CONSUMING THE PROCEEDS OF THEIR HUNTING AND THEY HAD MISCALCULATED
HALF AN HOUR LATER GUIDED BY ITS ELECTRIC TRAIL WE REACHED THE NAUTILUS
CONSEIL AND I WILL BE INSIDE WAITING FOR YOU THE CANADIAN LEFT WITHOUT GIVING ME TIME TO ANSWER HIM
DID HE REGRET THOSE WORDS HE HAD JUST PRONOUNCED IN FRENCH
NOW IT WAS A SCHOOL OF ARGONAUTS THEN VOYAGING ON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
ACTUAL GAME
FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM ANY VIEWS I DRIFTED FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER
I WAS WONDERING WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS URGENT NEED FOR SLEEP WHEN I FELT A DENSE TORPOR SATURATE MY BRAIN
THE ASTROLABE WENT TO ITS RESCUE AND ALSO RAN AGROUND
INLAID WITH EBONY TRIM TALL OAKEN SIDEBOARDS STOOD AT BOTH ENDS OF THIS ROOM AND SPARKLING ON THEIR SHELVES WERE STAGGERED ROWS OF EARTHENWARE PORCELAIN AND GLASS OF INCALCULABLE VALUE
THE NAUTILUS SUFFERED A COLLISION THAT CRACKED ONE OF THE ENGINE LEVERS AND IT STRUCK THIS MAN
CHAPTER 7 THE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS THE MEDITERRANEAN YOUR IDEAL BLUE SEA
THESE FINS ARE FLEXIBLE ABLE TO ASSUME ANY POSITION AND CAN BE OPERATED FROM INSIDE BY MEANS OF POWERFUL LEVERS
IN THE DISTANCE IS A MOUNTAINOUS HORIZON A WONDROUSLY UNDULATING LINE THAT MAKES UP THE BACKGROUND OF THIS LANDSCAPE
BUT I HELD NO HOPES THAT THE SUN WOULD MAKE AN APPEARANCE THAT DAY
THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S SPEED INCREASED
WILL IT ATTACK US UNDER THE WAVES
THE COLD WAS BRISK
A HUNTING TRIP NED EXCLAIMED
FOR MY PART I STARED AT THEM WITH ANXIOUS EYES AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY MISSING A LIMB OR TWO
JUST THEN A NOISE WAS AUDIBLE OUTSIDE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN WE CAN'T GO FORWARD BACKWARD OR SIDEWAYS
FOR A GOOD WHILE THE CANADIAN HAD SAID NOTHING MORE TO ME ABOUT HIS ESCAPE PLANS
WHAT UNHEARD-OF SCENERY AND WHY ARE WE REDUCED TO PRESERVING IT ONLY AS A MEMORY WOULD YOU LIKE CAPTAIN NEMO ASKED ME TO BRING BACK MORE THAN JUST A MEMORY WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN THAT NOTHING COULD BE EASIER THAN TAKING A PHOTOGRAPH OF THIS UNDERWATER REGION BEFORE I HAD TIME TO EXPRESS THE SURPRISE THIS NEW PROPOSITION CAUSED ME A CAMERA WAS CARRIED INTO THE LOUNGE AT CAPTAIN NEMO'S REQUEST
TRAVELING THESE DEEP REGIONS WHERE NO MAN HAS EVER VENTURED BEFORE
YOU COULD TELL IN ADVANCE THAT THE SPERM WHALES WOULD BE VICTORIOUS NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY WERE BETTER BUILT FOR FIGHTING THAN THEIR HARMLESS ADVERSARIES BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY COULD STAY LONGER UNDERWATER BEFORE RETURNING TO BREATHE AT THE SURFACE
THEY TASTE LIKE CHICKEN STUFFED WITH TRUFFLES CONSEIL SAID
AS FOR YOU PROFESSOR ARONNAX YOU'RE A MAN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING EVEN SILENCE
IT SEPARATES QUEENSLAND FROM THE HUGE ISLAND OF PAPUA ALSO CALLED NEW GUINEA
BUT WHAT WERE MERE WINDS TO THIS NAUTILUS WHICH NO STORMS COULD INTIMIDATE
WHAT EXCELLENT GAME ESPECIALLY IN A STEW
I TOUCHED HIM WITH MY HAND AND POINTED TO THE WALLS OF OUR PRISON
LUCKILY MY BOWIE KNIFE HASN'T LEFT ME AND I CAN STILL SEE WELL ENOUGH TO PUT IT TO USE THE FIRST ONE OF THESE BANDITS WHO LAYS A HAND ON ME AUTHOR'S NOTE
SO THE REACTION SET IN
ITS CONTENT WAS THE SAME BUT THE FORM DIFFERED
TAKING HIS AX AND WIELDING IT WITH GREAT VIGOR HE SOON STRETCHED OUT ON THE GROUND TWO OR THREE SAGO PALMS WHOSE MATURITY WAS REVEALED BY THE WHITE DUST SPRINKLED OVER THEIR PALM FRONDS
WE'LL BE HERE WE'LL BE THERE ME I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW
ONE OF THESE CHIEFTAINS CAME FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE NAUTILUS EXAMINING IT WITH CARE
BY ONE O'CLOCK WE HAD RETURNED
SHOOT YOU DEMENTED VESSEL
STEAMING SULFUROUS FUMES UNCOILED IN THE MIDST OF WAVES BUBBLING LIKE WATER IN A BOILER
ABRAHAM LINCOLN DEAD FROM THE BULLET OF A BELIEVER IN SLAVERY
BUT NO SOLEMN PROMISES BIND US TO THE COMMANDER OF THIS VESSEL NONE SIR THE STRANGER REPLIED
OVER AN EXTENSIVE AREA THE SOIL CONSISTED OF THAT IGNEOUS GRAVEL CALLED TUFF REDDISH IN COLOR AS IF MADE FROM CRUSHED BRICKS
THE CAPTAIN APPROACHED PLACED A FINGER OVER A POSITION ON THE CHART AND PRONOUNCED JUST ONE WORD
AFTER THE DOOR TO MY STATEROOM WAS CLOSED HE SAT AND STARED AT ME SILENTLY
THERE OUR NAUTILUS WAS COMPLETED BY ME AND MY WORKMEN IN OTHER WORDS BY MY GALLANT COMPANIONS WHOM I'VE MOLDED AND EDUCATED
HE DESCRIBED HIS FISHING TRIPS AND HIS BATTLES WITH GREAT NATURAL LYRICISM
AT THIS RATE IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT WE WOULD NEVER CATCH UP WITH IT
WHATEVER THE RANGE OF ITS FLIGHT HOWEVER EVASIVE ITS TRAJECTORY EVEN UP AND OVER THE NAUTILUS THE HAPLESS FLYING FISH ALWAYS FOUND A DOLPHIN TO WELCOME IT WITH OPEN MOUTH
AN INSTANT LATER THE LONGBOAT'S SAILORS HELPED US OVERBOARD ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND WE SET FOOT ON LEVEL SAND IN A METER AND A HALF OF WATER
BUT BY THIS POINT OBSERVING STUDYING AND CLASSIFYING WERE OUT OF THE QUESTION
MY TWO COMPANIONS LAY DOWN ON THE CABIN'S CARPETING AND WERE SOON DEEP IN SLUMBER
NOT ONE CREWMAN WAS VISIBLE FOR A SINGLE INSTANT
IN THESE POLAR SEAS FORBIDDEN TO MAN DID HE FEEL RIGHT AT HOME THE LORD OF THESE UNREACHABLE REGIONS
THIS ENCOUNTER DIDN'T SURPRISE ME BECAUSE I KNEW THESE ANIMALS WERE BEING HUNTED SO RELENTLESSLY THAT THEY TOOK REFUGE IN THE OCEAN BASINS OF THE HIGH LATITUDES
BUT BEFORE I COULD REPLY HE SHOWED ME A MANUSCRIPT OPEN ON THE TABLE AND TOLD ME IN A MORE SERIOUS TONE
LET'S BLOW IT UP AND IF IT STILL RESISTS LET'S PUT WINGS ON THE NAUTILUS AND FLY OVER IT OVER IT PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED SERENELY
CONSEIL HAD TOLD HIS FRIEND ABOUT THE WONDERS OF OUR UNDERSEA STROLL AND THE CANADIAN WAS SORRY HE HADN'T GONE ALONG
IN THIS SECOND YEAR OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY CALENDAR ON THE 11TH AND 12TH DAYS IN THE MONTH OF PASTURE THIS SQUADRON FOUGHT AN ENCOUNTER WITH ENGLISH VESSELS
AND $500.00 TO THE MAN WHO CAN PIERCE THAT INFERNAL BEAST CALM OF EYE COOL OF FEATURE AN OLD GRAY-BEARDED GUNNER I CAN SEE HIM TO THIS DAY--APPROACHED THE CANNON PUT IT IN POSITION AND TOOK AIM FOR A GOOD WHILE
I ENCOUNTERED HIM ONLY AT RARE INTERVALS
ACCORDINGLY PEOPLE HAVE PROPOSED NAMING THIS DEVILFISH BOUGUER'S SQUID AND HOW LONG WAS IT THE CANADIAN ASKED
ON JANUARY 18 THE NAUTILUS LAY IN LONGITUDE 105 DEGREES AND LATITUDE 15 DEGREES SOUTH
COME ON CONSEIL I TOLD HIM
WHAT AN AGONIZING DAY I SPENT TORN BETWEEN MY DESIRE TO REGAIN MY FREE WILL AND MY REGRET AT ABANDONING THIS MARVELOUS NAUTILUS LEAVING MY UNDERWATER RESEARCH INCOMPLETE
NOW FOR ALL THE REASONS PUT FORWARD TO THIS POINT I BELIEVED THAT THIS ANIMAL WAS A MEMBER OF THE BRANCH VERTEBRATA CLASS MAMMALIA GROUP PISCIFORMA AND FINALLY ORDER CETACEA
LEAVE MASTER BEHIND HE REPLIED
NED MY FRIEND YOU'RE A SLAYER OF FISH A HIGHLY SKILLED FISHERMAN
CHAPTER 16 STROLLING THE PLAINS THIS CELL PROPERLY SPEAKING WAS THE NAUTILUS'S ARSENAL AND WARDROBE
I WAS BUSY TRACING THE NAUTILUS'S COURSE ON THE WORLD MAP
I'VE SEEN THE NAUTILUS AT WORK OUT IN FRONT OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND I KNOW WHERE I STAND ON ITS SPEED
OUR SOUNDING LINES INDICATED THAT THEY DROPPED PERPENDICULARLY FOR MORE THAN 300 METERS AND OUR ELECTRIC BEAMS MADE THE BRIGHT LIMESTONE POSITIVELY SPARKLE
AN ACCIDENT I SAID TO HIM
THERE COULD NO LONGER BE ANY DOUBT
19 6
MY CHIEF OFFICER WAS STANDING BESIDE HIM
THE CORAL REALM 132 SECOND PART 1
WE'RE SHUT UP IN A RELATIVELY CONFINED AREA
TWO MONTHS LATER TESTIMONY FROM A CERTAIN COMMANDER BOWEN ABOARD THE ALBEMARLE ALLEGED THAT RUBBLE FROM SHIPWRECKED VESSELS HAD BEEN SEEN ON THE COAST OF NEW GEORGIA
THE GREAT EASTERN PUT BACK TO SEA ON JULY 13 1866
WELL MASTER NEEDS TO EAT HIS LUNCH
IT WAS MT
WE STAYED IN THIS PLACE AN ENTIRE HOUR CONTEMPLATING ITS VAST PLAINS IN THE LAVA'S GLOW WHICH SOMETIMES TOOK ON A STARTLING INTENSITY
BUT I WAS MISTAKEN AND ONCE AGAIN WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH MONSTERS OF THE DEEP
29 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS AT RANDOM
IN TWO MINUTES WE WERE ON THE STRAND
A CASTAWAY I EXCLAIMED
QUARTO CONSEIL WENT ON UNABASHED THE APODS WITH LONG BODIES THAT LACK PELVIC FINS AND ARE COVERED BY A HEAVY OFTEN GLUTINOUS SKIN AN ORDER CONSISTING OF ONLY ONE FAMILY
AND THE HELMSMAN STANDING ALONE CALMER HIS FACE SMOOTH AND SERIOUS HIS GRIZZLED HAIR PLASTERED TO HIS BROW HIS HANDS CLUTCHING THE WHEEL SEEMED EVEN YET TO BE GUIDING HIS WRECKED THREE-MASTER THROUGH THE OCEAN DEPTHS
EH CONSEIL PUT IN
SIR THE COMMANDER SAID ARE YOU UP TO PRESSURE AYE SIR THE ENGINEER REPLIED
WHEN THE NAUTILUS PASSED BETWEEN THEM COVERING THEM WITH SHEETS OF ELECTRICITY THEY SEEMED READY TO SALUTE US WITH THEIR COLORS AND SEND US THEIR SERIAL NUMBERS
EH
WHAT WAS IT
WHAT WAS IT
UNDOUBTEDLY PEOPLE NOW KNEW WHERE THEY STOOD ON THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SO-CALLED MONSTER
THERE'S DEFINITELY A WHALE LURKING IN OUR WATERS
SEXTO AND LAST CONSEIL SAID THE PLECTOGNATHS WHOSE MAXILLARY BONE IS FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE SIDE OF THE INTERMAXILLARY THAT FORMS THE JAW AND WHOSE PALATE ARCH IS LOCKED TO THE SKULL BY SUTURES THAT RENDER THE JAW IMMOVABLE AN ORDER LACKING TRUE PELVIC FINS AND WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO FAMILIES
SO IT IS HERE AMONG THESE GALLANT PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN US IN THAT I'M REVIEWING MY NARRATIVE OF THESE ADVENTURES
SOMETIMES I TRIED TO PEER THROUGH THE DENSE GLOOM WHICH WAS BROKEN ONLY BY THE PHOSPHORESCENT FLICKERS COMING FROM OUR MOVEMENTS
BUT WILL MASTER TELL ME WHY THIS HUGE SMELTER SUSPENDED OPERATIONS AND HOW IT IS THAT AN OVEN WAS REPLACED BY THE TRANQUIL WATERS OF A LAKE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD CONSEIL BECAUSE SOME CONVULSION CREATED AN OPENING BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN THE OPENING THAT SERVES AS A PASSAGEWAY FOR THE NAUTILUS
THESE GRACEFUL MOLLUSKS WERE SWIMMING BACKWARD BY MEANS OF THEIR LOCOMOTIVE TUBES SUCKING WATER INTO THESE TUBES AND THEN EXPELLING IT
IN THE VERY HEART OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED ME A VOLCANO WHOSE INTERIOR WAS INVADED BY THE SEA AFTER SOME CONVULSION IN THE EARTH
AFTER THIS WE SHOULD INSIST THAT NATURE EQUIP THEM WITH WICKS IN ADVANCE HALF A MILE FARTHER ON THE GROUND WAS COMPLETELY RIDDLED WITH PENGUIN NESTS EGG-LAYING BURROWS FROM WHICH NUMEROUS BIRDS EMERGED
THUS NO OTHER COURSE WOULD DO BUT TO NAME IT FOR ITS HUE AN ARTISTIC EXPLANATION CAPTAIN NEMO I REPLIED BUT I'M UNABLE TO REST CONTENT WITH IT
LATER HE WOULD EXTRACT THE FLOUR BY SIFTING IT THROUGH CLOTH TO SEPARATE IT FROM ITS FIBROUS LIGAMENTS LET IT DRY OUT IN THE SUN AND LEAVE IT TO HARDEN INSIDE MOLDS
I EXPECTED NED LAND TO GREET THIS NEWS WITH UNFEIGNED SATISFACTION
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY FELT ABOUT BEING SHOVED INSIDE THIS AQUATIC PRISON BUT AS FOR ME I WAS SHIVERING ALL OVER
ON ONE SIDE THOSE FAVORING A MONSTER OF COLOSSAL STRENGTH
WALLS WERE INVENTED SIMPLY TO FRUSTRATE SCIENTISTS
I OPENED IT IMPATIENTLY
WHY NOT
INSTINCTIVELY I WORRIED THAT I MIGHT GET SOAKED
NED LAND STUFFED HIS HAVERSACK WITH IT
THE SHEET-IRON WALLS WERE DEAF
BUT WHEN WE HAD ASCENDED TO AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT 250 FEET WE WERE STOPPED BY INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES
BOOKS ON MECHANICS BALLISTICS HYDROGRAPHY METEOROLOGY GEOGRAPHY GEOLOGY ETC HELD A PLACE THERE NO LESS IMPORTANT THAN WORKS ON NATURAL HISTORY AND I REALIZED THAT THEY MADE UP THE CAPTAIN'S CHIEF READING
WE'RE SURE TO END UP BUMPING INTO SOME ANIMAL WITH EITHER FEATHERS OR FUR IF NOT IN THIS LOCALITY THEN IN ANOTHER AND IF NOT TODAY THEN TOMORROW BECAUSE WE MUSTN'T WANDER TOO FAR OFF CONSEIL ADDED
THE LATTER HAS A DIAMETER OF 6 METERS A PITCH OF 7.5 METERS AND CAN DO UP TO 120 REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE AND THAT GIVES YOU A SPEED OF FIFTY MILES PER HOUR THERE LAY A MYSTERY BUT I DIDN'T INSIST ON EXPLORING IT
THESE POLYPARIES WERE STICKING TO ROCKS SHELLS OF MOLLUSKS AND EVEN THE STALKS OF WATER PLANTS
THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME THAT MANY TRIBES OF SEALS USED TO INHABIT THESE SHORES
BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE HAD BEEN FORESEEN BECAUSE I FELT MYSELF PROPELLED INTO A LITTLE ROOM ADJOINING THE WARDROBE
AND EVEN THE NAUTILUS RISING SUPERIOR TO EVERY DANGER IN THE SEA WAS ABOUT TO BECOME INTIMATE WITH ITS CORAL REEFS
GUARANIAN MACKEREL FURNISHED WITH TWO ANAL FINS
THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED HERE MAKES ITS WAY TO THE STERN WHERE ELECTROMAGNETS OF HUGE SIZE ACTIVATE A SPECIAL SYSTEM OF LEVERS AND GEARS THAT TRANSMIT MOVEMENT TO THE PROPELLER'S SHAFT
BUT I MUSTN'T LET THESE FANTASIES RUN AWAY WITH ME
TO THE NATURALIST'S EYE ITS GRACEFULLY ROUNDED CROWN FORMED OF BIG MULTILOBED LEAVES WAS ENOUGH TO DENOTE THE ARTOCARPUS THAT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSPLANTED TO THE MASCARENE ISLANDS EAST OF MADAGASCAR
IT OCCURRED TO ME LORD KNOWS WHY THAT THIS BOAT BURIED UNDER THE SEA MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE ATLAS LOST WITH ALL HANDS SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO AND NEVER HEARD FROM AGAIN
THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW WE STARED AT THE LOWER STRATA OF THIS SOUTHERNMOST OCEAN
THE COMPASS STILL SHOWED OUR HEADING AS EAST-NORTHEAST THE PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED A PRESSURE OF FIVE ATMOSPHERES CORRESPONDING TO A DEPTH OF FIFTY METERS AND THE ELECTRIC LOG GAVE OUR SPEED AS FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
ONCE IT WAS ABREAST OF CAPE HORN I THOUGHT IT WOULD STRIKE WEST OF THE CAPE MAKE FOR PACIFIC SEAS AND COMPLETE ITS TOUR OF THE WORLD
THE NEXT MORNING I CLIMBED ON DECK
WHETHER THIS LAYOVER WOULD HELP OR HINDER NED LAND'S SCHEMES I COULDN'T HAVE SAID
OH REALLY AND I CAN PROVE IT TO YOU WITH A FEW SIMPLE FIGURES BOSH NED REPLIED
NIGHTFALL DIDN'T INTERRUPT MY OBSERVATIONS
FIVE METERS AWAY A SHADOW APPEARED AND DROPPED TO THE SEAFLOOR
BUT IN ALL HONESTY WHILE IMPRISONED IN THESE HEAVY CLOTHES AND NAILED TO THE DECK BY MY LEAD SOLES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TAKE A SINGLE STEP
SOME THIRTY PICTURES BY THE MASTERS UNIFORMLY FRAMED AND SEPARATED BY GLEAMING PANOPLIES OF ARMS ADORNED WALLS ON WHICH WERE STRETCHED TAPESTRIES OF AUSTERE DESIGN
WHEN IT WAS AFLOAT THE CREW TOWED IT LEADING IT RIGHT ABOVE THE IMMENSE TRENCH OUTLINED TO MATCH THE SHIP'S WATERLINE
HOW DID HE GET THIS WOUND I ASKED HIM
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO JOIN THE EXPEDITION ON THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNION WILL BE PLEASED TO REGARD YOU AS FRANCE'S REPRESENTATIVE IN THIS UNDERTAKING
THAT TASK IS PERFORMED WITH ELEVEN STRAINERS OR SIEVES THAT ARE PIERCED WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF HOLES
I THEN CONSIDERED LEAVING MY STATEROOM
OVER THE PERIOD 1869-71
NED LAND WAS ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD
THEY'RE FIRING AT US I EXCLAIMED
FURIOUS NED TRIED TO SEE THROUGH THE MISTS ON THE HORIZON
P
P
P
THE STARBOARD WALL HAD MOVED FORWARD TO A POINT LESS THAN FOUR METERS FROM THE NAUTILUS'S HULL
TO THE EYE DELIGHTFUL JELLYFISH TO THE TOUCH ACTUAL NETTLES THAT OOZE A CORROSIVE LIQUID
I COUNTED FOUR OF THEM--FOUR MEN ONE STILL STANDING AT THE HELM THEN A WOMAN HALFWAY OUT OF A SKYLIGHT ON THE AFTERDECK HOLDING A CHILD IN HER ARMS
YOU HAVE RIGHT ON YOUR SIDE AND MY ARGUMENTS CAN'T STAND UP TO YOURS
NO ERRORS WERE COMMITTED IN OUR MANEUVERS
WE FOLLOWED HIM DOWN A GENTLE SLOPE AND DISAPPEARED UNDER THE WAVES
CONSEIL I CALLED IN AN IMPATIENT VOICE
IF I CAN'T TAKE THE SUN'S ALTITUDE TOMORROW I WON'T BE ABLE TO TRY AGAIN FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS
SEVEN DAYS LATER ON FEBRUARY 13 THE ISLET OF APHROESSA APPEARED LEAVING A TEN-METER CHANNEL BETWEEN ITSELF AND NEA KAMENI
WITH GREAT PROMPTNESS THE LIGHT REAPPEARED AND GREW STRONGER
THE LONE REBEL AMONG US WAS CONSEIL WHO SEEMED UTTERLY UNINTERESTED IN THE QUESTION EXCITING US AND WAS OUT OF STEP WITH THE GENERAL ENTHUSIASM ON BOARD
THIS MEANT DETACHING ABOUT 6,500 CUBIC METERS TO DIG A HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE SHIP COULD DESCEND BELOW THIS TRACT OF ICE
DURING THE FIRST MONTHS OF THE YEAR 1867 THE QUESTION SEEMED TO BE BURIED AND IT DIDN'T SEEM DUE FOR RESURRECTION WHEN NEW FACTS WERE BROUGHT TO THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION
CAPTAIN NEMO WAS WITH THEM
WHAT HAPPENED CONSEIL ASKED
THIS MANEUVER DID NOT ESCAPE THE CANADIAN
EVERYTHING THROUGH ELECTRICITY 58 13
THEY'RE PRICED BY THE MEASURING CUP AND ARE USED MAINLY IN THE CREATION OF EMBROIDERY FOR CHURCH VESTMENTS BUT IT MUST BE A LONG HARD JOB SORTING OUT THESE PEARLS BY SIZE THE CANADIAN SAID
DON'T BE SO IRRITABLE NED I THEN TOLD THE HARPOONER AND DON'T RUIN THINGS FOR US WITH POINTLESS VIOLENCE
THE SKIFF IS IN PLACE AND THE HATCHES ARE CLOSED
FOR SO MANY DAYS NOW THESE NATURAL WONDERS AND ARTISTIC MASTERWORKS HAD BEEN CENTRAL TO MY LIFE AND I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND FOREVER
ITS SHORES SEEMED COVERED WITH GREENERY FROM ITS BEACHES TO ITS SUMMITS INLAND CROWNED BY MT
THE NAUTILUS IS MADE UP OF TWO HULLS ONE INSIDE THE OTHER
DILLON RETURNED TO CALCUTTA
WHY HAD THE NAUTILUS COME TO VISIT ITS GRAVE
BUT I SAID GETTING BACK TO PEARLS OF GREAT VALUE I DON'T THINK ANY SOVEREIGN EVER POSSESSED ONE SUPERIOR TO THE PEARL OWNED BY CAPTAIN NEMO THIS ONE CONSEIL SAID POINTING TO A MAGNIFICENT JEWEL IN ITS GLASS CASE
IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE WE REACH THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL IT CAN'T BE VERY EASY TO ENTER IT NO SIR
HE BROUGHT DOWN A WHITE PIGEON AND A RINGDOVE WHICH WERE BRISKLY PLUCKED HUNG FROM A SPIT AND ROASTED OVER A BLAZING FIRE OF DEADWOOD
BUT TO ROAM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA WHEN YOU'RE ALMOST CERTAIN TO MEET MAN-EATERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S ANOTHER STORY
BUT THEN THE NAUTILUS VEERED AWAY AGAIN AND WENT LOOKING FOR THE LOWEST DEPTHS OF AN UNDERWATER VALLEY GOUGED BETWEEN THIS CAPE AND SIERRA LEONE ON THE COAST OF AFRICA
I ASSUMED THAT CAPTAIN NEMO WAS STATIONED IN THE PILOTHOUSE
ANYHOW WE'LL BE ARMED AND ON OUR WAY WE MIGHT HUNT A MAN-EATER OR TWO
IT'S CARRYING OUR DIVING EQUIPMENT AND WE'LL SUIT UP JUST BEFORE WE BEGIN OUR UNDERWATER EXPLORING CAPTAIN NEMO TOOK ME TO THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY WHOSE STEPS LED TO THE PLATFORM
GET UP
I WENT TO BED BUT SLEPT PRETTY POORLY
BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES COULDN'T WE ALL DIE OF ASPHYXIATION
ANYHOW WE'LL LEAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO SHIP THE WHOLE MENAGERIE TO FRANCE THEN WE AREN'T RETURNING TO PARIS CONSEIL ASKED
THUS THEY DIE IN THE OPEN AIR AND BY THE END OF TEN DAYS THEY'VE ROTTED SUFFICIENTLY
BUT I STILL CATCH GLIMPSES OF OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE THAT ARE SURROUNDED BY INVOLVEMENTS AND SECRETS THAT ALONE ON BOARD MY COMPANIONS AND I CAN'T SHARE
SO I WAS MARVELING AT THIS DELIGHTFUL SUNRISE SO LIFE-GIVING AND CHEERFUL WHEN I HEARD SOMEONE CLIMBING ONTO THE PLATFORM
I SEE SOME INSTRUMENTS HANGING ON THE WALLS OF THIS LOUNGE WHOSE PURPOSES ARE UNKNOWN TO ME
AN ELECTRIC WIRE PUTS IT IN CONTACT WITH THE PATENT LOG
THERE I SAW A COLLECTION OF INCALCULABLE VALUE THAT I HAVEN'T TIME TO DESCRIBE COMPLETELY
HIS MOVEMENTS WERE SYSTEMATICALLY EXECUTED AND FOR HALF AN HOUR NO DANGER SEEMED TO THREATEN HIM
SOME OF THESE SHELLS WERE FURROWED WITH FLAKY GREENISH BANDS THAT RADIATED DOWN FROM THE TOP
BUT AS FOR LONGBOATS NOT A ONE IN SIGHT
BUT ABOVE WATER AS WELL AS UNDERWATER SHAFTS OF ELECTRIC LIGHT ARE TRANSMITTED WITH INCOMPARABLE CLARITY
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY SHOULD WE DETEST OR ADMIRE THIS MAN
IT LIGHTS US AND WITH A UNIFORMITY AND CONTINUITY NOT EVEN POSSESSED BY SUNLIGHT
IN THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP FINE SAMPLES OF ALGAE IN PARTICULAR CERTAIN FUCUS PLANTS WHOSE ROOTS WERE LADEN WITH THE WORLD'S BEST MUSSELS
I OBSERVED IT CAREFULLY TRYING TO FIND OUT THE NATURE OF THIS GIGANTIC CETACEAN
IN ADDITION TO ME THE SKIFF CARRIED CAPTAIN NEMO TWO CREWMEN AND THE INSTRUMENTS--IN OTHER WORDS A CHRONOMETER A SPYGLASS AND A BAROMETER
I FOLLOWED HIM BOLDLY
EARLY IN THE MORNING ON NOVEMBER 11 FRESH AIR POURED THROUGH THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR INFORMING ME THAT WE HAD RETURNED TO THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN TO RENEW OUR OXYGEN SUPPLY
I ENTERED
ONE OF THE NAUTILUS'S MEN PRESENTED ME WITH A STREAMLINED RIFLE WHOSE BUTT WAS BOILERPLATE STEEL HOLLOW INSIDE AND OF FAIRLY LARGE DIMENSIONS
IN FACT THE MYSTERY OF THAT LAST AFTERNOON WHEN WE WERE LOCKED IN PRISON AND PUT TO SLEEP THE CAPTAIN'S VIOLENT PRECAUTION OF SNATCHING FROM MY GRASP A SPYGLASS POISED TO SCOUR THE HORIZON AND THE FATAL WOUND GIVEN THAT MAN DURING SOME UNEXPLAINED COLLISION SUFFERED BY THE NAUTILUS ALL LED ME DOWN A PLAIN TRAIL
WHO IN HADES EVER BELIEVED IN THEM THE CANADIAN EXCLAIMED
THE COLD-TEMPERATURE POLES AND THE GEOGRAPHICAL POLES DON'T COINCIDE IN EITHER THE NORTHERN OR SOUTHERN HEMISPHERES AND UNTIL PROOF TO THE CONTRARY WE CAN ASSUME THESE TWO SPOTS ON THE EARTH FEATURE EITHER A CONTINENT OR AN ICE-FREE OCEAN I THINK AS YOU DO PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED
CONSEIL LAID IN A SUPPLY OF THEM BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE PROPERLY COOKED THESE WINGED CREATURES MAKE A PLEASANT DISH
DAMNATION EXCLAIMED THE FURIOUS CANADIAN
ONLY THE PROPELLER'S VIBRATIONS DISTURBED THE DEEP SILENCE REIGNING ON BOARD
THE SOIL WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY MADREPORIC BUT CERTAIN DRY STREAM BEDS WERE STREWN WITH GRANITE RUBBLE PROVING THAT THIS ISLAND WAS OF PRIMORDIAL ORIGIN
IN ESSENCE BEATING THE BUSHES THE TWO FRIENDS FLUSHED A HERD OF KANGAROOS THAT FLED BY BOUNDING AWAY ON THEIR ELASTIC PAWS
WHAT FOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED
WHAT ARE MY DISCOVERIES TO DATE
THERE IN PLACE OF NATURAL WONDERS THE WATERY MASS OFFERED SOME THRILLING AND DREADFUL SCENES TO MY EYES
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY FOUND WHAT ALL MANKIND WILL SURELY FIND ONE DAY THE TRUE DYNAMIC POWER OF ELECTRICITY I'M NOT SO CERTAIN THEY'LL FIND IT CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED ICILY
ROTTING WEEDS HAVE POISONED THE AIR AND THIS POISONED AIR CAUSES THE YELLOW FEVER THAT DEVASTATES THESE WONDERFUL COUNTRIES
HE WAS COMING TOWARD ME ARMS CROSSED SILENT NOT WALKING BUT GLIDING LIKE A GHOST
THE HEAT GENERATED BY OUR BATTERIES WAS SO INTENSE THAT AFTER SIMPLY GOING THROUGH THE MECHANISM WATER DRAWN COLD FROM THE SEA ARRIVED BOILING HOT AT THE BODY OF THE PUMP
PRETTY PERPLEXED DUMONT D'URVILLE DIDN'T KNOW IF HE SHOULD GIVE CREDENCE TO THESE REPORTS WHICH HAD BEEN CARRIED IN SOME OF THE LESS RELIABLE NEWSPAPERS
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER CONSEIL APPROACHED ME SAYING
IT'S THE MOST TRANQUIL OF THE SEAS
HENCE THEY EMBODY A SORT OF NATURAL SOCIALISM
EXCELLENT NED LAND SAID
AND HOW DO YOU ACCOMPLISH THIS
I OWE EVERYTHING TO THE OCEAN
I MUST GO WITH THEM PERHAPS EVEN GUIDE THEM
THIS INCIDENT SEEMED TO FASCINATE NED LAND INTENSELY
WHAT'S CERTAIN IS THAT IN 615 B.C
I'LL ALSO MENTION THAT THE CANADIAN AT THE END OF HIS STRENGTH AND PATIENCE MADE NO FURTHER APPEARANCES
THEY HAVE EARS BUT HEAR NOT ED
AMONG ALL THE SURPRISES THE FUTURE HAD IN STORE FOR ME THIS WOULD NOT BE THE MILDEST
EACH SHIP BRINGS BACK AN AVERAGE CATCH OF 4,400 FISH MAKING 22,000,000
MY TWO COMPANIONS AND I BOWED REVERENTLY
I UP MAST AND HOIST SAIL--OR I TAKE OUT MY OARS--AND I GO FOR A SPIN BUT HOW DO YOU RETURN TO THE SHIP I DON'T PROFESSOR ARONNAX
HOWEVER THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF OUR ALMOST MOTIONLESS NAUTILUS I COULD SEE NOTHING AMONG THESE LONG FILAMENTS OTHER THAN THE CHIEF ARTICULATES OF THE DIVISION BRACHYURA
THE NEXT DAY AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I WAS AWAKENED BY THE STEWARD WHOM CAPTAIN NEMO HAD PLACED EXPRESSLY AT MY SERVICE
COULD I HOPE TO BE RESCUED
NEXT TO ME MY TWO COMPANIONS WERE GETTING TIPSY ON THE FRESH OXYGEN PARTICLES
I LOST TRACK OF THE PASSING HOURS
SO WHERE WAS CAPTAIN NEMO TAKING US
IS IT A YEAR THAT WILL BRING OUR IMPRISONMENT TO AN END OR A YEAR THAT WILL SEE THIS STRANGE VOYAGE CONTINUE YE GODS CONSEIL REPLIED I HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO TELL MASTER
BUT THE WIND WAS BLOWING A STRONG GUST AND THE FURIOUS BILLOWS WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO FACE THEM IN A MERE SKIFF
IN THEIR ROTATIONAL AND ORBITAL MOVEMENTS STARS AND THEIR SATELLITES GO FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
THE CANADIAN LEAPED UP THE STEPS BUT I STOPPED HIM
TO ABSORB IT WE WOULD NEED TO FILL CONTAINERS WITH POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE AND SHAKE THEM CONTINUALLY
SOME MINUTES LATER IT STOPPED AT A DEPTH OF 833 METERS AND CAME TO REST ON THE SEAFLOOR
ON JANUARY 4 TWO DAYS AFTER CROSSING THE CORAL SEA WE RAISED THE COAST OF PAPUA
NOON ARRIVED AND JUST AS ON THE DAY BEFORE THE SUN DIDN'T PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
WHAT CRASHES FROM THE WATERS BREAKING AGAINST SHARP ROCKS ON THE SEAFLOOR WHERE THE HARDEST OBJECTS ARE SMASHED WHERE TREE TRUNKS ARE WORN DOWN AND WORKED INTO A SHAGGY FUR AS NORWEGIANS EXPRESS IT
IT WAS HERE TOO THAT LIEUTENANT PARKER ABOARD THE AMERICAN FRIGATE CONGRESS WAS UNABLE TO REACH THE UNDERWATER SOIL AT 15,149 METERS
ITS SLANTING FINS DREW IT TO DEPTHS OF 2,000 AND 3,500 METERS
CAPTAIN NEMO SET THE EXAMPLE AND WAS FOREMOST IN SUBMITTING TO THIS STRICT DISCIPLINE
NO DOUBTS WERE POSSIBLE
NOW PROFESSOR YOU KNOW EVEN BETTER THAN I THAT NATURE DOESN'T VIOLATE GOOD SENSE AND SHE WOULDN'T GIVE SOME NATURALLY SLOW ANIMAL THE ABILITY TO MOVE SWIFTLY IF IT HADN'T A NEED TO USE THAT TALENT
THIS WAS OUR CHANCE AND COMMANDER FARRAGUT WAS DETERMINED TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF IT
THIS ONCE-IMPORTANT CITY USED TO CONTAIN SIX PUBLIC MARKETPLACES PLUS TWENTY-SIX MOSQUES AND ITS WALLS PROTECTED BY FOURTEEN FORTS FASHIONED A THREE-KILOMETER GIRDLE AROUND IT
I TOOK ONE LAST LOOK AT THE NATURAL WONDERS AND ARTISTIC TREASURES AMASSED IN THE MUSEUM THIS UNRIVALED COLLECTION DOOMED TO PERISH SOMEDAY IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEAS TOGETHER WITH ITS CURATOR
IF SO HE WOULD HAVE TO KEEP UP SOME KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SHORE TO COME BY THE MATERIALS NEEDED FOR SUCH AN OPERATION
WE THEN WENT WITH THE CURRENT OF THE SEA'S GREATEST RIVER WHICH HAS ITS OWN BANKS FISH AND TEMPERATURE
WE'VE ARRIVED AT THE FOOTHILLS OF THESE MOUNTAINS AND I THINK WE'LL DO BETTER IF WE RETURN TO THE FOREST REGIONS IT WAS GOOD ADVICE AND WE TOOK IT
IT WAS AN ADULT AS COULD BE SEEN FROM THE SIX ROWS OF TEETH FORMING AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE IN ITS UPPER JAW
ALL THESE PIGEONS ARE ONLY APPETIZERS SNACKS
AEGRI SOMNIA 126 24
THE GULF STREAM 274 20
CAPTAIN NEMO DECIDED TO TAKE HIS NAUTILUS DOWN TO THE LOWEST DEPTHS IN ORDER TO DOUBLE-CHECK THESE DIFFERENT SOUNDINGS
HOWEVER DURING THE DAY OF MARCH 16 THESE TRACTS OF ICE COMPLETELY BARRED OUR PATH
AND THE REFRACTION OF THE SUN ALREADY LOW ON THE HORIZON AGAIN RINGED THE EDGES OF VARIOUS OBJECTS WITH THE ENTIRE COLOR SPECTRUM
I MUST ADMIT THAT HE FLATLY DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THE UNICORN AND ALONE ON BOARD HE DIDN'T SHARE THE GENERAL CONVICTION
I DIDN'T ANSWER HIM BACK LETTING HIM BLOW OFF ALL THE STEAM HE WANTED
SOON KEELING ISLAND DISAPPEARED BELOW THE HORIZON AND OUR COURSE WAS SET TO THE NORTHWEST TOWARD THE TIP OF THE INDIAN PENINSULA
THEY'VE EXISTED FOR 2,000 OR 3,000 YEARS AND I MIX THEM UP IN MY MIND
I SEIZED HIS ARM
IT LAY TO AT HALF STEAM IN AN EFFORT TO HOLD STEADY ON THE WAVES
BEYOND A STARK SILENCE REIGNED IN THIS DESOLATE NATURAL SETTING A SILENCE BARELY BROKEN BY THE FLAPPING WINGS OF PETRELS OR PUFFINS
SOME FIFTEEN OF THE NAUTILUS'S SEAMEN SURROUNDED THEIR CAPTAIN AND STARED WITH A FEELING OF IMPLACABLE HATE AT THE SHIP BEARING DOWN ON THEM
HUNGER SPURRED US ON
LIGHTING UP THE SEAFLOOR EVEN THIRTY FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN THE SUN ASTONISHED ME WITH ITS POWER
NEAR EVENING REAO ISLAND MELTED INTO THE DISTANCE AND THE NAUTILUS NOTICEABLY CHANGED COURSE
AND THEY REPRESENTED AN ENORMOUS SUM OF MONEY
WHENEVER HE ENCOUNTERED THE CAPTAIN HIS EYES WOULD FLICKER WITH DARK FIRE AND I WAS IN CONSTANT DREAD THAT HIS NATURAL VEHEMENCE WOULD CAUSE HIM TO DO SOMETHING RASH
THIS POWERFUL ANIMAL IS AUDIBLE FROM FAR AWAY WHEN IT SENDS UP TOWERING SPOUTS OF AIR AND STEAM THAT RESEMBLE SWIRLS OF SMOKE
I REGARDED HIM WITH INTENSE EXCITEMENT SILENTLY ANALYZING HIS STRANGE FACIAL EXPRESSION
BUT I COULDN'T LINGER
AND YET NOBODY PROLONGED HIS UNDERWATER WORK BEYOND THE TIME ALLOTTED HIM
MY BOY I REPLIED WHEN I EXPRESSED THE BELIEF THAT THESE PAPUAN NATIVES WERE A THREAT TO HIS NAUTILUS THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED ME WITH GREAT IRONY
OR ON THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS THAT ON THE FISHING THE CANADIAN REPLIED
BACK ON BOARD THE SAILORS HELPED DIVEST US OF OUR HEAVY COPPER CARAPACES
AS FOR OUR CRAFT IT NO LONGER STIRRED STAYING AS MOTIONLESS AS IF THESE CORAL POLYPS HAD ALREADY WALLED IT IN WITH THEIR INDESTRUCTIBLE CEMENT
HE PONDERED
CONSEIL OBSERVED AND CLASSIFIED HIS ZOOPHYTES ARTICULATES MOLLUSKS AND FISH
TURTLES CAME TO LAY THEIR EGGS
THEN IT'S AN AIR GUN SURELY
IN THE MEANTIME THEN I WAS BUSY CLASSIFYING MY MINERALOGICAL BOTANICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL TREASURES WHEN THAT INCIDENT TOOK PLACE WITH THE SCOTIA
I OVERCAME THE HORROR THAT ITS APPEARANCE INSPIRED IN ME PICKED UP A PENCIL AND BEGAN TO SKETCH IT
I RECOGNIZED THE LOWER SLOPES OF SOME MAGNIFICENT ROCKS CARPETED BY THE FINEST ZOOPHYTE SPECIMENS AND RIGHT OFF I WAS STRUCK BY AN EFFECT UNIQUE TO THIS MEDIUM
IT WAS NO CORPSE LOST IN THE WAVES
ITS MASS OF FILAMENTS ATTACHED IT TO A TABLE OF GRANITE AND THERE IT GREW BY ITSELF IN THE MIDST OF THE CAVE'S CALM WATERS
NED LAND SEIZED A HARPOON
I FELT ONLY A CERTAIN TIGHTNESS IN THE JOINTS OF MY FINGERS AND EVEN THIS DISCOMFORT SOON DISAPPEARED
BUT NED LAND WAS NOT MISTAKEN AND WE ALL SPOTTED THE OBJECT HIS HAND WAS INDICATING
I NOTED SOME ONE-DECIMETER SOUTHERN BULLHEAD A SPECIES OF WHITISH CARTILAGINOUS FISH OVERRUN WITH BLUISH GRAY STRIPES AND ARMED WITH STINGS THEN SOME ANTARCTIC RABBITFISH THREE FEET LONG THE BODY VERY SLENDER THE SKIN A SMOOTH SILVER WHITE THE HEAD ROUNDED THE TOPSIDE FURNISHED WITH THREE FINS THE SNOUT ENDING IN A TRUNK THAT CURVED BACK TOWARD THE MOUTH
THE NAUTILUS DIDN'T STAY IDLE AND CRUISING ALONG THE COAST IT ADVANCED SOME TEN MILES FARTHER SOUTH AMID THE HALF LIGHT LEFT BY THE SUN AS IT SKIMMED THE EDGE OF THE HORIZON
IF THE LABYRINTH BECAME HOPELESSLY TANGLED THE SUBMERSIBLE WOULD RISE ABOVE IT LIKE AN AIRSHIP AND AFTER CLEARING THE OBSTACLE IT WOULD RESUME ITS SPEEDY COURSE JUST A FEW METERS ABOVE THE OCEAN FLOOR
THE SKIFF COULDN'T AVOID THE COLLISION
I FELT A MORTAL CHILL FREEZE MY DULL NEARLY PARALYZED LIMBS
AND IS CONSEIL GOING TO RISK IT NED ASKED
I WANT TO OBSERVE THE FULL SERIES OF THESE WONDERS GATHERED UNDER THE SEAS OF OUR GLOBE
YOU MAY GO PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME
AND THE FINBACK WHALE YELLOWISH BROWN THE SWIFTEST OF ALL CETACEANS
THE PRESENCE OF THIS FURNACE UNDER THE WATERS HAD ME EXTREMELY PUZZLED
A HIGH-SPEED FRIGATE THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS FITTED OUT FOR PUTTING TO SEA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
THERE GOES THE FORTUNE OF A WHOLE WHALING FLEET WELL SIR THE CANADIAN ASKED COULDN'T I HUNT THEM JUST SO I DON'T FORGET MY OLD HARPOONING TRADE HUNT THEM
THE POSSIBILITY OF PERISHING IN OUR RECKLESS UNDERTAKING WAS THE LEAST OF MY WORRIES
IN THE LIBRARY I OFTEN FOUND BOOKS HE HAD LEFT OPEN ESPECIALLY BOOKS ON NATURAL HISTORY
BEST TO TRY AND FORGET HIM
THE NAUTILUS LAY PERFECTLY STILL
HAD WE RISEN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
AND WOE TO THE FOREIGNER WHO LIFTS A FINGER AGAINST THESE SACRED SAURIANS
THAT EXPLAINS PERFECTLY ALL THAT BELLOWING WE HEARD WHEN OUR SO-CALLED NARWHALE LAY IN SIGHT OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN PERFECTLY MR LAND
HE MIXED SULFUR WITH SOME DRY LEAVES SET THEM ON FIRE WITH A SPARK FROM HIS TINDERBOX AND PROCEEDED TO SMOKE THE BEES OUT
BUT AS ONE INTELLECTUAL HAS REMARKED HERE PERHAPS IS THE ACTUAL POINT WHERE LIFE RISES HUMBLY OUT OF SLUMBERING STONE BUT WITHOUT BREAKING AWAY FROM ITS CRUDE STARTING POINT FINALLY AFTER TWO HOURS OF WALKING WE REACHED A DEPTH OF ABOUT 300 METERS IN OTHER WORDS THE LOWERMOST LIMIT AT WHICH CORAL CAN BEGIN TO FORM
ALL RIGHT THEN MY FINE HARPOONER IF VERTEBRATES SEVERAL HUNDRED METERS LONG AND PROPORTIONATE IN BULK LIVE AT SUCH DEPTHS THEIR SURFACE AREAS MAKE UP MILLIONS OF SQUARE CENTIMETERS AND THE PRESSURE THEY UNDERGO MUST BE ASSESSED IN BILLIONS OF KILOGRAMS
YOU MAY TALK FREELY THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME
UNDER REVERSE STEAM IMMEDIATELY THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN BEAT TO PORT SWEEPING IN A SEMICIRCLE
THEN NIGHT FELL IN THE MIDST OF A HEAVY SILENCE OCCASIONALLY BROKEN BY THE CALLS OF PELICANS AND NOCTURNAL BIRDS BY THE SOUND OF SURF CHAFING AGAINST ROCKS OR BY THE DISTANT MOAN OF A STEAMER CHURNING THE WAVES OF THE GULF WITH NOISY BLADES
WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO OCCUPY HIM HERE
HE WOULD SEE ME PERHAPS SPEAK TO ME
YES NED WITH YOUR OWN TWO EYES WITH MY OWN TWO EYES WHERE MAY I ASK IN SAINT-MALO CONSEIL RETURNED UNFLAPPABLY
IN ONE HOUR EACH MAN CONSUMES THE OXYGEN CONTAINED IN 100 LITERS OF AIR HENCE DURING TWENTY-FOUR HOURS THE OXYGEN CONTAINED IN 2,400 LITERS
SO IN 1867 THIS COMPANY OWNED TWELVE SHIPS EIGHT WITH PADDLE WHEELS AND FOUR WITH PROPELLERS
I COULD SEE HOW HEAVILY THIS PROTRACTED IMPRISONMENT WAS WEIGHING ON HIM
AFTER CHANGING CLOTHES I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM AND IN THE GRIP OF DREADFULLY OBSESSIVE THOUGHTS I SAT NEXT TO THE BEACON
JUST THEN THE SEAFLOOR BEGAN TO SLOPE SHARPLY DOWNWARD
THE CLASS SPONGIARIA CONTAINS ABOUT 300 SPECIES THAT ARE ENCOUNTERED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF SEAS AND EVEN IN CERTAIN STREAMS WHERE THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN THE NAME FRESHWATER SPONGES
AS CAPTAIN NEMO HAD COMMENTED WE WERE ARRIVING IN THESE WATERWAYS A MONTH TOO SOON
WE'VE GOTTEN OUT OF TIGHTER SPOTS
ALL RIGHT WE'LL SEE IF IT CAN OUTRUN OUR CONICAL SHELLS
I WAS READY
AND REPTILES BY VIRGATA TURTLES BELONGING TO THE GENUS CHELONIA WHICH FURNISHED OUR TABLE WITH A DAINTY BUT WHOLESOME DISH
I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO YOU
A GLEEFUL NED PROPOSED THAT WE RETURN THE NEXT DAY TO THIS MAGIC ISLAND WHICH HE PLANNED TO DEPOPULATE OF ITS EVERY EDIBLE QUADRUPED
WELL I ASKED HIM
ARRIVING AT THE SUMMIT OF THIS PEAK CAPTAIN NEMO CAREFULLY DETERMINED ITS ELEVATION BY MEANS OF HIS BAROMETER SINCE HE HAD TO TAKE THIS FACTOR INTO ACCOUNT IN HIS NOON SIGHTS
IT WAS ONLY A FLEETING GLIMMER BUT ITS EFFECT WAS INDESCRIBABLE
CONSEIL PICKED A COUPLE BUNCHES
CONSEIL AND I WILL GO TO THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY
THE CANADIAN CONSEIL AND I SANK OUR WEAPONS INTO THESE FLESHY MASSES
FROM SUCH SLENDER THREADS HANG THE DESTINIES OF NATIONS
MY EYES DIDN'T LEAVE THE PRESSURE GAUGE
WE KNOW MORE ABOUT MARS THAN WE KNOW ABOUT THE OCEANS THIS REALITY BEGINS TO EXPLAIN THE DARK POWER AND OTHERWORLDLY FASCINATION OF TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS
AND AS I STARED AT THIS DESOLATE WRECKAGE CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME IN A SOLEMN VOICE
NOBODY BY THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY OR THE CREW'S QUARTERS
BENEATH THEIR PIERCED DISTENDED EARLOBES THERE DANGLED STRINGS OF BEADS MADE FROM BONE
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WERE
THE FLOOR OF THIS PRISON LAY HIDDEN BENEATH THICK HEMPEN MATTING THAT DEADENED THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS
SOME NEW PHENOMENON NOT QUITE MY FRIENDS I REPLIED
HOW CAN I DESCRIBE IT
ACCORDINGLY DESPITE STRONG COMPETITION FROM FRANCE PASSENGERS STILL CHOOSE THE CUNARD LINE IN PREFERENCE TO ALL OTHERS AS CAN BE SEEN IN A RECENT SURVEY OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
THE NAUTILUS IS BRINGING US TO VANIKORO I ASKED
PARTRIDGE FAMILY NED LAND ASKED
I OBSERVED THAT THESE MEDITERRANEAN DEPTHS BECAME MORE AND MORE CLUTTERED WITH SUCH GRUESOME WRECKAGE AS THE NAUTILUS DREW NEARER TO THE STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR
AFTER FIVE STEPS I ENCOUNTERED AN IRON WALL MADE OF RIVETED BOILERPLATE
BY THEN IT WAS RISING TO THE SURFACE BUT CAUTIOUSLY WHILE SLOWLY EMPTYING ITS BALLAST TANKS
THEY MAKE GOOD PETS AND TOGETHER WITH CERTAIN OTHER NATURALISTS I THINK THESE ANIMALS CAN BE PROPERLY TRAINED TO PERFORM YEOMAN SERVICE AS HUNTING DOGS FOR FISHERMEN
I COULD SEE PERFECTLY THEIR UNDULATING SPIRAL-SHAPED SHELLS WHICH CUVIER APTLY COMPARED TO AN ELEGANT COCKLEBOAT
BUT JUST WHEN I LEAST EXPECTED IT I LAID MY HANDS ON A WONDER A NATURAL DEFORMITY I'D HAVE TO CALL IT SOMETHING VERY SELDOM ENCOUNTERED
I CONSULTED THE PRESSURE GAUGE
I SEARCHED ITS SURFACE FOR AN OPENING OR A HATCH A MANHOLE TO USE THE OFFICIAL TERM
OH I GRANT YOU IF THE NAUTILUS HAD EMERGED FROM THE STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR AND MADE FOR THAT CAPE IN THE SOUTH IF IT WERE TAKING US TOWARD THOSE REGIONS THAT HAVE NO CONTINENTS THEN I'D SHARE YOUR ALARM
TO SAY CANADIAN IS TO SAY FRENCH AND AS UNSOCIABLE AS NED LAND WAS I MUST ADMIT HE TOOK A DEFINITE LIKING TO ME
I WAS CONVINCED THAT WHEN CAPTAIN NEMO REACHED THIS POINT HE WOULD BACK OUT AGAIN
AND THIS REACTION WASN'T LONG IN COMING
REEFS WERE STILL NUMEROUS BUT MORE WIDELY SCATTERED AND WERE FIXED ON THE CHART WITH THE GREATEST ACCURACY
WOULD YOU STILL SAY CAPTAIN NEMO THAT WE REALLY KNOW NOTHING NO PROFESSOR THE CAPTAIN REPLIED I WOULDN'T BE SO DISCOURTEOUS
WHEN THE MONSTER'S DETRACTORS CITED A SAYING BY THE BOTANIST LINNAEUS THAT NATURE DOESN'T MAKE LEAPS WITTY WRITERS IN THE POPULAR PERIODICALS PARODIED IT MAINTAINING IN ESSENCE THAT NATURE DOESN'T MAKE LUNATICS AND ORDERING THEIR CONTEMPORARIES NEVER TO GIVE THE LIE TO NATURE BY BELIEVING IN KRAKENS SEA SERPENTS MOBY DICKS AND OTHER ALL-OUT EFFORTS FROM DRUNKEN SEAMEN
A SINGLE DETAIL COMES BACK TO ME
NED AND CONSEIL MY TWO GALLANT FRIENDS WERE SACRIFICING THEMSELVES TO SAVE ME
WE DISEMBARKED AND THINKING IT BEST TO ABIDE BY THE CANADIAN'S INSTINCTS WE FOLLOWED NED LAND WHOSE LONG LEGS THREATENED TO OUTPACE US
I SPOTTED THE ROUNDED DOMES OF ITS MOSQUES THE ELEGANT TIPS OF ITS MINARETS AND ITS FRESH LEAFY TERRACES
YET FOR THE IMAGININGS OF THESE STORYTELLERS THERE HAD TO BE IF NOT A CAUSE AT LEAST AN EXCUSE
BUT SOME PRELIMINARY VIBRATIONS COULD SOON BE FELT OVER THE BOAT'S HULL
I SAW ONLY THE HELMSMAN IMPRISONED IN HIS GLASS-WINDOWED PILOTHOUSE
BESIDES WHEN I SAW MASTER FAINTING IT LEFT ME WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DESIRE TO BREATHE
THE AIR INSIDE THE NAUTILUS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RENEWED FOUR HOURS EARLIER FOLLOWING DAILY PRACTICE ON BOARD
THERE CAPTAIN NEMO STOPPED AND HIS HAND INDICATED AN OBJECT THAT I HADN'T YET NOTICED
CHAPTER 9 A LOST CONTINENT THE NEXT MORNING FEBRUARY 19 I BEHELD THE CANADIAN ENTERING MY STATEROOM
YOU COULD PLAINLY SEE ITS 250 SUCKERS ARRANGED OVER THE INNER SIDES OF ITS TENTACLES AND SHAPED LIKE SEMISPHERIC CAPSULES
WHAT A HUBBUB ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
EACH OF THESE FAMILIES IS DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL GENERA EACH GENUS INTO SPECIES EACH SPECIES INTO VARIETIES
WORK BEGAN IMMEDIATELY AND WAS CARRIED ON WITH TIRELESS TENACITY
IT WAS MADE UP OF VARIOUS FISH AND SOME SLICES OF SEA CUCUMBER THAT PRAISEWORTHY ZOOPHYTE ALL GARNISHED WITH SUCH HIGHLY APPETIZING SEAWEED AS THE PORPHYRA LACINIATA AND THE LAURENCIA PRIMAFETIDA
FINALLY ON MARCH 10 A SMALLER ISLET CALLED REKA APPEARED NEXT TO NEA KAMENI AND SINCE THEN THESE THREE ISLETS HAVE FUSED TO FORM ONE SINGLE SELFSAME ISLAND WHAT ABOUT THIS CHANNEL WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW I ASKED
BUT IN THE TORRES STRAIT ONE STILL FINDS A METER-AND-A-HALF DIFFERENCE IN LEVEL BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW SEAS
AND THE POWER OF THEIR LIGHT WAS INCREASED BY THOSE GLIMMERS UNIQUE TO MEDUSAS STARFISH COMMON JELLYFISH ANGEL-WING CLAMS AND OTHER PHOSPHORESCENT ZOOPHYTES WHICH WERE SATURATED WITH GREASE FROM ORGANIC MATTER DECOMPOSED BY THE SEA AND PERHAPS WITH MUCUS SECRETED BY FISH
BUT WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I MENTIONED THIS SERIOUS COMPLICATION TO CAPTAIN NEMO
OUR RIFLES RIFLES
THE CAPTAIN WAS STILL STROLLING THERE HIS STEPS AGITATED
DRIVEN BY ENERGETIC ARMS THE LONGBOAT FLEW ON ITS TRAIL
A PERPLEXING CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE WE WEREN'T IN THE LOW LATITUDES AND BESIDES ONCE THE NAUTILUS WAS SUBMERGED IT SHOULDN'T BE SUBJECT TO ANY RISE IN TEMPERATURE
THE NAUTILUS WAS TRAVELING AT THE FRIGHTFUL SPEED OF FORTY MILES PER HOUR
WHAT WAS THE USE AT SUCH A DISTANCE
I SOUGHT THEM GREEDILY FERRETED THEM OUT TIRELESSLY AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER SOME OBJECTS OF GREAT VALUE
THAT'S ALL I HAVE ON ME MASTER HAS NEVER BEEN MORE GENEROUS CONSEIL REPLIED
THE WHOLE MEAGER FLORA OF THIS REGION CONSISTED OF CERTAIN MICROSCOPIC BUDS RUDIMENTARY DIATOMS MADE UP OF A TYPE OF CELL POSITIONED BETWEEN TWO QUARTZ-RICH SHELLS PLUS LONG PURPLE AND CRIMSON FUCUS PLANTS BUOYED BY SMALL AIR BLADDERS AND WASHED UP ON THE COAST BY THE SURF
SO I HAD DIFFICULTY DECIDING HE SAID
I EVEN BOUGHT A PEARL NECKLACE FOR MY FIANCéE KATE TENDER BUT SHE MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE INSTEAD
IN DISCUSSING THESE COLOSSAL PLANTS CONSEIL NED AND I WERE NATURALLY LED INTO MENTIONING THE SEA'S GIGANTIC ANIMALS
CONSEQUENTLY UNDER THESE CONDITIONS IT NEEDED TO DISPLACE ONLY NINE-TENTHS OF ITS VOLUME HENCE 1,356.48 CUBIC METERS
AS FOR THE AVERAGE DEPTH OF THIS PART OF THE PACIFIC I'LL INFORM YOU THAT IT'S A MERE 4,000 METERS THIS SAID CAPTAIN NEMO HEADED TO THE HATCH AND DISAPPEARED DOWN THE LADDER
DESPITE ITS SPEED THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN THE MIDST OF THIS SCHOOL OF ANIMALS AND ITS NETS BROUGHT UP AN INCALCULABLE NUMBER AMONG WHICH I RECOGNIZED ALL NINE SPECIES THAT PROFESSOR ORBIGNY HAS CLASSIFIED AS NATIVE TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN
WHY IN EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH SNAP YOUR JAWS SMACK YOUR LIPS AND TEETH ISN'T THAT THE WORLD'S MOST UNDERSTANDABLE MESSAGE
MY COMPANIONS CAME OVER
THAT DAY THE SIXTH OF OUR IMPRISONMENT CAPTAIN NEMO CONCLUDED THAT PICKS AND MATTOCKS WERE TOO SLOW TO DEAL WITH THE ICE LAYER STILL SEPARATING US FROM OPEN WATER--AND HE DECIDED TO CRUSH THIS LAYER
NEXT TO THIS GALLEY WAS A BATHROOM CONVENIENTLY LAID OUT WITH FAUCETS SUPPLYING HOT OR COLD WATER AT WILL
THIS EFFECT WAS CAUSED BY MYRIADS OF TINY LUMINOUS ANIMALS WHOSE BRIGHTNESS INCREASED WHEN THEY GLIDED OVER THE METAL HULL OF OUR SUBMERSIBLE
LIKE HIS FABLED ARTHUR GORDON PYM I EXPECTED ANY MOMENT TO SEE THAT SHROUDED HUMAN FIGURE VERY FAR LARGER IN ITS PROPORTIONS THAN ANY DWELLER AMONG MEN THROWN ACROSS THE CATARACT THAT PROTECTS THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE POLE
I FELT AS IF A HEAVY WEIGHT HAD BEEN LIFTED FROM ME AND I WAS ABLE TO RESUME MY REGULAR TASKS IN A STATE OF COMPARATIVE CALM
THE CAPTAIN WALKED STRAIGHT TOWARD IT AND WE WERE BACK ON BOARD JUST AS THE FIRST GLIMMERS OF DAWN WERE WHITENING THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
IT CAN SUCK DOWN NOT ONLY SHIPS BUT WHALES AND EVEN POLAR BEARS FROM THE NORTHERNMOST REGIONS
CHAPTER 11 THE SARGASSO SEA THE NAUTILUS DIDN'T CHANGE DIRECTION
AND DON'T THINK THAT THE PRESENCE OF THESE SALTS IS DUE MERELY TO SOME WHIM OF NATURE
IT'S LIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE NED LAND EXCLAIMED KNIFE IN HAND STAYING ON THE DEFENSIVE
IT WAS NO LONGER ILLUMINATED WATER IT WAS LIQUID LIGHT
EVEN THIS WAS INTOLERABLE
THE LONGBOAT'S COXSWAIN TOOK THE TILLER
THEY WERE GOOD I ADMIT BUT WITH A PECULIAR FLAVOR TO WHICH I WOULD SOON GROW ACCUSTOMED
THEN HE ADDED
AFTER MOORING THE SKIFF WE REENTERED THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR
HENCE I COULD HAVE ANSWERED YOU AS EARLY AS OUR INITIAL INTERVIEW BUT FIRST I WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE AND THEN THINK THINGS OVER
THEY WERE ASTONISHED AT THE CAPTAIN'S INEXPLICABLE ABSENCE
BUT HERE IT WAS NO LONGER SOME ISOLATED BUSH OR A MODEST GROVE OF LOW TIMBER
THEN CROSSING HIS ARMS
THE SLEEVES ENDED IN SUPPLE GLOVES THAT DIDN'T IMPEDE HAND MOVEMENTS
THE LAST WORDS OF CAPTAIN NEMO 294 23
ALL THESE EVENTS PASSED BEFORE MY EYES LIKE BACKDROPS UNROLLING UPSTAGE IN A THEATER
YES HE SAID THE OCEAN OWNS A GENUINE CIRCULATION AND TO START IT GOING THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS HAS ONLY TO INCREASE ITS HEAT SALT AND MICROSCOPIC ANIMAL LIFE
THIS STAGGERS THE MIND
THEN OFF IN THE DISTANCE IT TURNED BLUE AND FADED IN THE MIDST OF A HAZY DARKNESS
THE NEXT DAY I RELATED THE NIGHT'S EVENTS TO CONSEIL AND THE CANADIAN EVENTS THAT HAD AROUSED MY CURIOSITY TO A FEVER PITCH
THEN PROFESSOR ARONNAX I PROPOSE AN UNUSUAL EXCURSION PROPOSE AWAY CAPTAIN SO FAR YOU'VE VISITED THE OCEAN DEPTHS ONLY BY DAY AND UNDER SUNLIGHT
BUT CAPTAIN NEMO GOT THERE FIRST
HIS BEWILDERED EYES INDICATED THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW TO WHAT SUPERHUMAN CREATURES HE OWED BOTH HIS LIFE AND HIS FORTUNE
THAT'S A DUGONG ORDER SIRENIA GROUP PISCIFORMA SUBCLASS MONODELPHIA CLASS MAMMALIA BRANCH VERTEBRATA CONSEIL REPLIED
DURING THE DAY OF DECEMBER 11 I WAS BUSY READING IN THE MAIN LOUNGE
I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT UNTIL I COUNT THEM MYSELF SO COUNT THEM CONSEIL
THE LATTER SEEMED TO BE IN THE GRIP OF AN EXCITEMENT HE TRIED IN VAIN TO CONTROL
LIKEWISE DR ROBERT D
THE LIQUID MASSES CAME INTO VIEW BRIGHTLY LIT BY THE SHIP'S ELECTRIC OUTPOURINGS
I RAN TO HIS RESCUE
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE NOTHING WE'LL EVER SEE FROM THIS SHEET-IRON PRISON
THIS LAND OF FIRE FORMS A HUGE CLUSTER OF ISLANDS OVER THIRTY LEAGUES LONG AND EIGHTY LEAGUES WIDE EXTENDING BETWEEN LATITUDE 53 DEGREES AND 56 DEGREES SOUTH AND BETWEEN LONGITUDE 67 DEGREES 50 AND 77 DEGREES 15 WEST
A REAL MESS CALL BY THUNDER
BUT WHILE THEY'RE SIMPLE TO DO SUCH CALCULATIONS CAN GIVE ONLY A VERY UNCERTAIN FIGURE NO PROBLEM THE CANADIAN WENT ON INSISTENTLY
MEANWHILE TURNING THE NAUTILUS MADE A CIRCLE AROUND THE SINKING SHIP AND FOR AN INSTANT I COULD READ THE BOARD ON ITS STERN
HE'LL SURELY HAVE TO STOP IF ONLY AT THE ICE BANK AND HE'LL RETURN TO THE SEAS OF CIVILIZATION
I WASN'T SAYING A THING CAPTAIN THEN SIR WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'LL BID YOU GOOD EVENING AND WITH THAT CAPTAIN NEMO LEFT THE LOUNGE
NOT A SOUL BREATHED ON BOARD
THESE MINES EXTEND UNDER THE WAVES LIKE THE COALFIELDS AT NEWCASTLE
HE GAVE AN ORDER
OUR FRIGATE DREW NEARER TO THE CETACEAN
I UNDERSTOOD HIS FEAR
GO TO IT MY BOY AND CONSEIL IN HIS SERENE VOICE DESCRIBED FOR THE THIRD TIME THE VARIOUS VICISSITUDES OF OUR STORY
THEY LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE AT ANCHOR BY SOME IMMENSE OPEN OFFSHORE MOORING WHERE THEY WERE WAITING FOR THEIR DEPARTURE TIME
BUT I IMAGINE YOU HAVE PRESSING REASONS FOR LOOKING ME UP VERY PRESSING
IT'S ONLY FIT TO BE SOLD FOR ITS WEIGHT
FISH COMMON TO THE OCEANS WE HAD ALREADY CROSSED
NOT AN ATOM FOR THE NAUTILUS
WE ALSO GATHERED IN A FEW SEA CUCUMBERS SOME PEARL OYSTERS AND A DOZEN SMALL TURTLES THAT WE SAVED FOR THE SHIP'S PANTRY
BUT IT STILL HAS TO BE PRODUCED IN SHORT EXTRACTED
I SWAM MORE VIGOROUSLY BUT HAMPERED BY CLOTHES THAT WERE AS RESTRICTING AS A CLOAK MADE OF LEAD I WAS MANAGING WITH ONLY THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY
WITHOUT UNLOADING THE CONVOY WOULD STAY IN CUSTODY AT THE OFFSHORE MOORING OF VIGO UNTIL THE ENEMY FLEETS HAD RETREATED
THE SECOND IS DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION
AS FOR ME WHOM FATE HAD JUST BROUGHT ABOARD HIS VESSEL WHOSE LIFE HE HAD HELD IN THE BALANCE
NOT A FACT HAS BEEN OMITTED NOT A DETAIL HAS BEEN EXAGGERATED
ONE OF THESE ELDERS RELATED THE HISTORY OF ANOTHER TOWN 1,000 YEARS OLDER STILL
THE ICE STRUCK SUPERB POSES
TO MARK THAT MIRACULOUS SEQUEL THE SEA TURNED A RED WITHOUT EQUAL
STILL THE SAME AUSTERE MONASTIC APPEARANCE
NEXT TO THIS CABINET I SAW A CHEST BOUND WITH HOOPS OF IRON ITS LID BEARING A COPPER PLAQUE THAT DISPLAYED THE NAUTILUS'S MONOGRAM WITH ITS MOTTO MOBILIS IN MOBILI
AN ELEGANT ROYAL HAMMER SHELL FROM THE INDIAN OCEAN WHOSE EVENLY SPACED WHITE SPOTS STOOD OUT SHARPLY AGAINST A BASE OF RED AND BROWN
BUT HE REMAINED MUTE AND EMOTIONLESS
WHEN IT OVERTURNED ONE OF THESE BLOCKS HIT THE NAUTILUS AS IT WAS CRUISING UNDER THE WATERS
CAPTAIN NEMO HADN'T EVEN SUGGESTED MY FETCHING NED OR CONSEIL
MY EYES FLEW TOWARD THE CLOCK
HE NO LONGER EVEN HEARD ME
LASTLY I CAN VOUCH--AS IMPROBABLE AS IT SEEMS--THAT EVEN IF I HAD WANTED TO DESTROY ALL MY ILLUSIONS EVEN IF I HAD BEEN WILLING TO GIVE IN TO DESPAIR I COULD NOT HAVE DONE SO
I'M UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE HOURS THAT PASSED IN THIS WAY
SO THE CAPTAIN WENT ON WHEN THE NAUTILUS LIES ON THE WAVES UNDER THESE CONDITIONS ONE-TENTH OF IT DOES EMERGE ABOVE WATER
AND HOW ABOUT YOU MR NED LAND LIKE A LOG PROFESSOR
THOSE POOR MEN LEAPED UP INTO THE SHROUDS CLUNG TO THE MASTS WRITHED BENEATH THE WATERS
WELL PROFESSOR
WE'RE IN EUROPE AND BEFORE CAPTAIN NEMO'S WHIMS TAKE US DEEP INTO THE POLAR SEAS OR BACK TO OCEANIA I SAY WE SHOULD LEAVE THIS NAUTILUS I CONFESS THAT SUCH DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CANADIAN ALWAYS BAFFLED ME
WHAT SPERM WHALES YOU'RE HANDING US
LATER SIR RICHARD HAWKINS CALLED THEM THE MAIDENLAND AFTER THE BLESSED VIRGIN
IT WAS CARVED UP IN SIGHT OF THE CANADIAN WHO REMAINED TO WATCH EVERY DETAIL OF THE OPERATION
BUT SAID CONSEIL WHO PERPETUALLY RETURNED TO THE DIDACTIC SIDE OF THINGS IS THIS PEARL FISHING EVER DANGEROUS NO I REPLIED QUICKLY ESPECIALLY IF ONE TAKES CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS WHAT RISKS WOULD YOU RUN IN A JOB LIKE THAT NED LAND SAID
CAN'T YOU FIND SOMETHING BETTER
SO YOU UNDERSTAND SIR THE STRANGER WENT ON THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO TREAT YOU AS MY ENEMY I KEPT QUIET WITH GOOD REASON
I DIDN'T THINK HE COULD STAND SUCH EXERTIONS FOR MUCH LONGER
JUST THEN LEANING OVER THE FORECASTLE RAILING I SAW NED LAND BELOW ME ONE HAND GRASPING THE MARTINGALE THE OTHER BRANDISHING HIS DREADFUL HARPOON
LONG SARDINES FROM THE GENUS ODONTOGNATHUS LIKE THREE-DECIMETER PIKE SHINING WITH A BRIGHT SILVER GLOW
HOUR AFTER HOUR WENT BY WITHOUT IT SHOWING THE LEAST SIGN OF WEARINESS
BUT I HOPED AN OPPORTUNITY WOULD ARISE FOR A VISIT TO THE FORESTS OF OCEANIA
THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT GO HOME
IT MANEUVERED TO CUT INTO THE HERD OF LONG-SKULLED PREDATORS
TENDERS ARE SMALL STEAMBOATS THAT ASSIST THE BIG LINERS
TENDERS ARE SMALL STEAMBOATS THAT ASSIST THE BIG LINERS
WE ARRIVED THERE ON MAY 28 AND THE NAUTILUS LAY NO FARTHER THAN 150 KILOMETERS FROM IRELAND
WE'RE CASTAWAYS WHOM YOU'VE CHARITABLY TAKEN ABOARD WE'LL NEVER FORGET THAT
THEY WILL EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO POISON THE SPRINGS WHERE THESE FOWL HABITUALLY DRINK
THEY'RE ENTHUSIASTIC EATERS OF MARINE VEGETABLES WHICH GIVES THEM AN EXQUISITE FLAVOR
YE GODS I'LL SLEEP SOUNDLY CONSEIL SAID
I HAD ASKED HIM NOTHING BUT HE READ MY THOUGHTS AND ON HIS OWN HE ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS I WAS ITCHING TO ADDRESS HIM
THIS CASUALTY CERTAINLY DATED FROM SOME FAR-OFF TIME
BESIDES COMMANDER FARRAGUT HAD MENTIONED THAT A CERTAIN SUM OF $2,000.00 WAS WAITING FOR THE MAN WHO FIRST SIGHTED THE ANIMAL BE HE CABIN BOY OR SAILOR MATE OR OFFICER
I STATED OUR NAMES AND TITLES
PROFESSOR HE SAID TO ME WOULD IT BE CONVENIENT FOR YOU TO MAKE AN UNDERWATER EXCURSION TODAY WITH MY COMPANIONS I ASKED
SOME OF THESE ANIMALS CAN THRIVE ONLY AT THE SURFACE OF SEAS OR RIVERS BUT A MINORITY CAN DWELL AT FAIRLY GREAT DEPTHS
NOW NED WE'RE ALL EARS I SAID
LIKE ACTUAL SNAILS WE WERE AT HOME IN OUR SHELL AND I CAN VOUCH THAT IT'S EASY TO TURN INTO A FULL-FLEDGED SNAIL
NOTHING COULD HAVE MADE A MORE UNUSUAL SIGHT THAN THE MARVELOUS TIMING WITH WHICH DOLPHINS HUNT THESE FISH
SIX MILES SEPARATED IT FROM US
EVEN IF I HAD DISCOVERED THAT SOME FABULOUS MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURE REALLY EXISTED IT WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH A TERRIFIC MENTAL JOLT
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS ECCENTRIC INDIVIDUAL WAS SIMPLY CONTINUING A CONVERSATION WE'D ALREADY STARTED
IT MEASURED THREE DECIMETERS LONG
MY SECOND HULL THE OUTER COVER INCLUDES A KEEL FIFTY CENTIMETERS HIGH BY TWENTY-FIVE WIDE WHICH BY ITSELF WEIGHS 62 METRIC TONS
I LEFT MY STATEROOM AND RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE WHICH WAS DESERTED AND PLUNGED IN NEAR DARKNESS
BUT TO THE SOUTH THERE IS A DEEP SUDDENLY OCCURRING DEPRESSION A 3,000-METER PIT
NEARLY CONSEIL REPLIED
THE NAUTILUS IS APPROACHING POPULATED AREAS
AT THE CLOSE OF DAY I SAW A BIG SHIP PASSING ON THE HORIZON STRUGGLING PAINFULLY
LET'S WAIT LET'S BE GUIDED BY EVENTS AND LET'S DO NOTHING SINCE RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ON THE CONTRARY PROFESSOR THE HARPOONER REPLIED NOT WANTING TO GIVE IN
I COULD FEEL THE ANGER BUILDING IN HIM
THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH SLAG LAVA FLOWS AND PUMICE STONES
IT'S MORE THAN JUST BREAD THE CANADIAN ADDED
MOST OF THESE SEALS WERE SLEEPING ON THE ROCKS OR THE SAND
BUT THANKS TO OUR SKILLFUL COXSWAIN WE WERE FOULED ON THE BIAS RATHER THAN BROADSIDE SO WE DIDN'T CAPSIZE
A BOWIE KNIFE IS A WIDE-BLADED DAGGER THAT AMERICANS ARE FOREVER CARRYING AROUND
A BOWIE KNIFE IS A WIDE-BLADED DAGGER THAT AMERICANS ARE FOREVER CARRYING AROUND
WE KNOW THAT DO WE CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED IN A TONE OF MILD SURPRISE
IT FELL AS FAR AS 73.5 CENTIMETERS
WHEN THIS CLOUD HAD DISPERSED THE SQUID WAS GONE AND SO WAS MY POOR FELLOW COUNTRYMAN
FOUR CREWMEN WERE WAITING AT THE DOOR AND THEY LED US TO THE CELL WHERE WE HAD SPENT OUR FIRST NIGHT ABOARD THE NAUTILUS
COMMANDER FARRAGUT TO MY THINKING HAD MADE A WISE MOVE IN HIRING ON THIS MAN
TO PUT A SIMPLE QUESTION TO YOU SIR THE CANADIAN ANSWERED ME
CHAPTER 21 A MASS EXECUTION THE WAY HE SAID THIS THE UNEXPECTEDNESS OF THIS SCENE FIRST THE BIOGRAPHY OF THIS PATRIOTIC SHIP THEN THE EXCITEMENT WITH WHICH THIS ECCENTRIC INDIVIDUAL PRONOUNCED THESE LAST WORDS--THE NAME AVENGER WHOSE SIGNIFICANCE COULD NOT ESCAPE ME--ALL THIS TAKEN TOGETHER HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON MY MIND
THEN I WENT TO BED
THE DINING ROOM 5 METERS LONG AND SEPARATED FROM THE LIBRARY BY A WATERTIGHT BULKHEAD IN OTHER WORDS IT COULDN'T BE PENETRATED BY THE SEA
WITH A SUPREME EFFORT SHE HAD LIFTED HER CHILD ABOVE HER HEAD AND THE POOR LITTLE CREATURE'S ARMS WERE STILL TWINED AROUND ITS MOTHER'S NECK
HERE LIES SUPREME TRANQUILITY
THE LOCAL FLORA WAS REPRESENTED BY FINE FLOATING ALGAE
I'LL MAKE A FERMENTED BATTER FROM ITS PULP THAT'LL KEEP INDEFINITELY WITHOUT SPOILING
THE NAUTILUS LOOKING LIKE A LONG REEF EMERGED FROM THE WAVES TWO MILES OFFSHORE
LET'S FORGE AHEAD
APPARENTLY THE NAUTILUS HAD GONE AGROUND THEN HEELED OVER SHARPLY
AFTER THIS THREE-DAY DELAY IF THE MONSTER HADN'T APPEARED OUR HELMSMAN WOULD GIVE THREE TURNS OF THE WHEEL AND THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD CHART A COURSE TOWARD EUROPEAN SEAS
I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING I KNEW--OR RATHER EVERYTHING I DIDN'T KNOW AND I ASKED HIM WHAT HE HAD SEEN OR HEARD ON HIS PART
I HAVEN'T LET THE NAUTILUS PULL TOO NEAR THE COAST AND WE'RE FAIRLY WELL OUT FROM THE MANNAR OYSTERBANK
CLOUDS WERE FLEEING TO THE SOUTH
THIS IS AN ACTUAL LAKE IN THE OPEN ATLANTIC AND THE GREAT CURRENT'S WATERS TAKE AT LEAST THREE YEARS TO CIRCLE IT
SINCE LOCAL EVAPORATION ISN'T ENOUGH TO RESTORE THE BALANCE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ADDED WATER SHOULD MAKE THIS SEA'S LEVEL HIGHER EVERY YEAR
SEE RIGHT NOW IT'S TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THAT'S PERFECT ANOTHER USE FOR ELECTRICITY
WASN'T ITS HEAD CONSEIL WENT ON CROWNED BY EIGHT TENTACLES THAT QUIVERED IN THE WATER LIKE A NEST OF SNAKES PRECISELY WEREN'T ITS EYES PROMINENTLY PLACED AND CONSIDERABLY ENLARGED YES CONSEIL AND WASN'T ITS MOUTH A REAL PARROT'S BEAK BUT OF FEARSOME SIZE CORRECT CONSEIL WELL WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY IF THIS ISN'T BOUGUER'S SQUID IT'S AT LEAST ONE OF HIS CLOSE RELATIVES I STARED AT CONSEIL
CONSEIL AND I STAYED BEHIND UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK SURVEYING THE BEACH OBSERVING AND STUDYING
DON'T WORRY CONSEIL MY FRIEND WE'RE NEVER GOING BACK TO THAT WORLD BY THIS POINT IT WAS FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
AFTER LEAVING KEELING ISLAND OUR PACE GOT GENERALLY SLOWER
THAT DAY MARCH 14 HE AND CONSEIL MANAGED TO FIND ME IN MY STATEROOM
BUT IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT THESE GRASSES ALGAE AND FUCUS PLANTS WERE CARRIED OFF FROM THE BEACHES OF EUROPE AND AMERICA THEN TAKEN AS FAR AS THIS ZONE BY THE GULF STREAM
HE AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE REPLACED BY NEW WORKMEN INCLUDING CONSEIL AND ME
HOWEVER VERNE GIVES HIS HERO'S BRILLIANCE AND BENEVOLENCE A DARK UNDERSIDE--THE MAN'S OBSESSIVE HATE FOR HIS OLD ENEMY
A THOUSAND SPECKS OF LIGHT GLITTERED IN THE MIDST OF THE GLOOM
HAD I ACCIDENTALLY CAUSED THESE SYMPTOMS OF ANGER
CAPTAIN NEMO CONTINUED TO PLUMMET INTO THE DARK DEPTHS OF THIS FOREST WHOSE SHRUBBERY GREW EVER MORE SPARSE
KILOGRAM KILO ROUGHLY 2.2 POUNDS HECTARE ROUGHLY 2.5 ACRES KNOT 1.15 MILES PER HOUR LEAGUE IN VERNE'S CONTEXT 2.16 MILES LITER ROUGHLY 1 QUART METER ROUGHLY 1 YARD 3 INCHES
BUT I WAS ALL SET TO TIE THE KNOT CONSEIL THE CANADIAN REPLIED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS AND IT WASN'T MY FAULT THE WHOLE BUSINESS FELL THROUGH
I WAITED I LISTENED I LIVED ONLY THROUGH MY SENSE OF HEARING
ITS TIMEPIECE MARKED 2:30
THE SOLAR RAYS EASILY CROSSED THIS AQUEOUS MASS AND DISPERSED ITS DARK COLORS
MY ALARM INCREASED
YOU'RE EVERLASTINGLY CALM
A STRENUOUS TASK BUT FEASIBLE THANKS TO OUR RELIEVING EACH OTHER
ONLY I MUST ASK YOU TO POSTPONE THE QUESTION OF NEW YEAR'S GIFTS AND TEMPORARILY ACCEPT A HEARTY HANDSHAKE IN THEIR PLACE
NOT A SOUND
MY MENTAL PROCESSES CAME TO A DEAD STOP
WE'LL ESCAPE I EXCLAIMED
MORE COAL WAS SWALLOWED BY THE FURNACES
THE SKY WAS OVERCAST
THAT EVENING CAPTAIN NEMO WAS FORCED TO OPEN THE SPIGOTS OF HIS AIR TANKS AND SHOOT A FEW SPOUTS OF FRESH OXYGEN THROUGH THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR
AND IF COMMANDER MAURY IS CORRECT WERE ONE TO HARNESS THE FULL WARMTH OF THIS CURRENT IT WOULD SUPPLY ENOUGH HEAT TO KEEP MOLTEN A RIVER OF IRON SOLDER AS BIG AS THE AMAZON OR THE MISSOURI JUST THEN THE GULF STREAM'S SPEED WAS 2.25 METERS PER SECOND
PROFESSOR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY
I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE LOUNGE WHEN CAPTAIN NEMO ENTERED
LET'S SHATTER THIS ICE BANK
AFTER OUR POSITION FIX I REENTERED THE LOUNGE AND WHEN OUR BEARINGS WERE REPORTED ON THE CHART I SAW THAT WE WERE OFF THE ISLAND OF CEYLON THAT PEARL DANGLING FROM THE LOWER LOBE OF THE INDIAN PENINSULA
SNIPEFISH WITH LONG JAWS EXCELLENT ANIMALS TWENTY-FIVE CENTIMETERS LONG AND GLEAMING WITH THE MOST CHEERFUL COLORS
EACH MAN WANTED ONE LAST LOOK WITH WHICH TO SUM UP HIS EXPERIENCE
IT'S WAKING UP UNDER THE SUN'S CARESSES
WELL NOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SEE HOW UNUSUAL THE CANADIAN PUT IN SETTING ASIDE HIS TANTRUMS AND GETAWAY SCHEMES WHILE SUBMITTING TO THIS IRRESISTIBLE ALLURE
CHAPTER 6 THE GREEK ISLANDS AT SUNRISE THE NEXT MORNING FEBRUARY 12 THE NAUTILUS ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
THE NAUTILUS SLOWED DOWN IN AN ODD MANNER AND VERY UNPREDICTABLE IN ITS WAYS IT SOMETIMES SWAM IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS SOMETIMES DRIFTED ON THEIR SURFACE
I COULDN'T ANSWER HIM
SO WE CAN'T RELY ON NATURE TO RESCUE US ONLY OUR OWN EFFORTS
OUR CONVERSATION THEN TURNED TO HIS EVERLASTING ESCAPE PLANS AND WITHOUT GOING TOO FAR I FELT I COULD OFFER HIM THIS HOPE
BY THE PRESIDENT THE PACIFIC AND THE CITY OF GLASGOW LOST FOR REASONS UNKNOWN
AS FOR ME I GAVE IN LESS READILY TO THIS INTENSE NEED FOR SLEEP
LASTLY A COUPLE SPECIES OF TRIGGERFISH THE CUCUYO WHOSE STIPPLED FLANKS GLITTER WITH A SPARKLING GOLD COLOR AND THE BRIGHT PURPLE LEATHERJACKET WHOSE HUES GLISTEN LIKE A PIGEON'S THROAT
THIS BOAT THIS SHEET-IRON MONSTER HAD OBVIOUSLY JUST RISEN TO THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN THERE TO BREATHE IN GOOD WHALE FASHION
WE MUST GIVE UP SEEING OUR HOMELAND FRIENDS AND RELATIVES EVER AGAIN YES SIR
AND NOW NED LAND I ADDED LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT
YET IT WASN'T SHORT OF MONEY PROVIDED THAT ITS GALLEONS LADEN WITH GOLD AND SILVER FROM AMERICA COULD ENTER ITS PORTS
BUT ONE DISTRESSING CIRCUMSTANCE TOTALLY THWARTED THE CANADIAN'S PLANS
THAT MEANS THEY DON'T SEE US AS CASTAWAYS CLINGING TO SOME WRECKAGE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER--GRACIOUS CONSEIL PUT IN SHAKING OFF THE WATER THAT HAD SPRAYED OVER HIM FROM ANOTHER SHELL
HE DIDN'T HEAR ME
ON FEBRUARY 9 THE NAUTILUS CRUISED IN THE WIDEST PART OF THE RED SEA MEASURING 190 MILES STRAIGHT ACROSS FROM SUAKIN ON THE WEST COAST TO QUNFIDHA ON THE EAST COAST
IF WE DO NOT KNOW EVERY ONE OF THEM IF NATURE STILL KEEPS ICHTHYOLOGICAL SECRETS FROM US NOTHING IS MORE ADMISSIBLE THAN TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF FISH OR CETACEANS OF NEW SPECIES OR EVEN NEW GENERA ANIMALS WITH A BASICALLY CAST-IRON CONSTITUTION THAT INHABIT STRATA BEYOND THE REACH OF OUR SOUNDINGS AND WHICH SOME DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER AN URGE OR A WHIM IF YOU PREFER CAN BRING TO THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE OCEAN FOR LONG INTERVALS
I WAS SUFFOCATING
IT WAS THE FRIGATE
IT DOESN'T FEAR HEAVILY TRAVELED SEAS
MOREOVER THEIR LINE OF DEMARCATION IS SO CLEAR THAT ABREAST OF THE CAROLINAS THE NAUTILUS'S SPUR CUT THE WAVES OF THE GULF STREAM WHILE ITS PROPELLER WAS STILL CHURNING THOSE BELONGING TO THE OCEAN
SEAHORSES AND DRAGONFISH BAD VERY BAD THE HARPOONER REPLIED
A DEVOTED LAD WHO WENT WITH ME ON ALL MY JOURNEYS
MAY THE EXECUTIONER PASS AWAY AND THE SCIENTIST CONTINUE HIS PEACEFUL EXPLORATION OF THE SEAS
HE LOOKED GLOOMY TO ME
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLEARING ON A PEDESTAL OF ROUGHLY PILED ROCKS THERE STOOD A CROSS OF CORAL EXTENDING LONG ARMS YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WERE MADE OF PETRIFIED BLOOD
BUT ON APRIL 11 IT ROSE SUDDENLY AND THE SHORE REAPPEARED AT THE MOUTH OF THE AMAZON RIVER A HUGE ESTUARY WHOSE OUTFLOW IS SO CONSIDERABLE IT DESALTS THE SEA OVER AN AREA OF SEVERAL LEAGUES
GIANT SQUID SPORT TEN TENTACLES NOT EIGHT
MY GALLANT NED IF YOU COME AND TELL ME A CHANCE TO ESCAPE IS AVAILABLE TO US THEN I'LL DISCUSS IT WITH YOU
WHAT AN AWFUL ANIMAL HE EXCLAIMED
I LEAPED ONTO THE PLATFORM
ORGAN-PIPE CORAL GORGONIAN CORAL ARRANGED INTO FAN SHAPES SOFT SPONGES FROM SYRIA ISIS CORAL FROM THE MOLUCCA ISLANDS SEA-PEN CORAL WONDERFUL CORAL OF THE GENUS VIRGULARIA FROM THE WATERS OF NORWAY VARIOUS CORAL OF THE GENUS UMBELLULARIA ALCYONARIAN CORAL THEN A WHOLE SERIES OF THOSE MADREPORES THAT MY MENTOR PROFESSOR MILNE-EDWARDS HAS SO SHREWDLY CLASSIFIED INTO DIVISIONS AND AMONG WHICH I NOTED THE WONDERFUL GENUS FLABELLINA AS WELL AS THE GENUS OCULINA FROM RéUNION ISLAND PLUS A NEPTUNE'S CHARIOT FROM THE CARIBBEAN SEA--EVERY SUPERB VARIETY OF CORAL AND IN SHORT EVERY SPECIES OF THESE UNUSUAL POLYPARIES THAT CONGREGATE TO FORM ENTIRE ISLANDS THAT WILL ONE DAY TURN INTO CONTINENTS
THE RED SEA
A NEW PROPOSITION FROM CAPTAIN NEMO 145 3
A MONTH FROM NOW IN THIS VERY PLACE THE NUMEROUS FISHING BOATS OF THE HARVESTERS WILL GATHER AND THESE ARE THE WATERS THEIR DIVERS WILL RANSACK SO DARINGLY
THEN PERLON SHARKS ASH GRAY PIERCED WITH SEVEN GILL OPENINGS FURNISHED WITH A SINGLE DORSAL FIN PLACED ALMOST EXACTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY
I SAT UP IN BED LISTENING IN THE DARKNESS AND THEN WAS SUDDENLY HURLED INTO THE MIDDLE OF MY STATEROOM
SIR NED LAND TOLD ME THAT DAY IF YOUR CAPTAIN GOES ANY FARTHER YES HE'LL BE A SUPERMAN HOW SO NED BECAUSE NOBODY CAN CLEAR THE ICE BANK
WHICH AMOUNTED TO FORGETTING OUR CASTAWAY STATUS FOR MUCH TOO LONG IF THEY REALLY HAD GOOD INTENTIONS TOWARD US
EVERY FILAMENT OR RIBBON NO MATTER HOW THIN STOOD RAMROD STRAIGHT
SO THE ICE BANK WAS HIGHER HERE THAN WE HAD FOUND IT ON THE OUTSKIRTS
HERE ALONE LIES INDEPENDENCE
AT LEAST ITS NATIONALITY WILL REMAIN A SECRET TO YOU
AN INDUCTION COIL GATHERS THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED AND DIRECTS IT TO A SPECIALLY DESIGNED LANTERN
LIVING IN A CONDUCTING MEDIUM SUCH AS WATER THIS BIZARRE ANIMAL CAN ELECTROCUTE OTHER FISH FROM SEVERAL METERS AWAY SO GREAT IS THE POWER OF ITS ELECTRIC ORGAN AN ORGAN WHOSE TWO CHIEF SURFACES MEASURE AT LEAST TWENTY-SEVEN SQUARE FEET
THE OPEN-SEA PLANTS HAD ALREADY LEFT BEHIND THE INCREASINGLY ARID SEAFLOOR WHERE A PRODIGIOUS NUMBER OF ANIMALS WERE STILL SWARMING
I DIDN'T DISTURB HIS MEDITATIONS BUT CONTINUED TO PASS IN REVIEW THE CURIOSITIES THAT ENRICHED THIS LOUNGE
BUT THIS HYPOTHESIS OF A WAR MACHINE COLLAPSED IN THE FACE OF FORMAL DENIALS FROM THE VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS
IT FEARS NEITHER THE RED SEA'S DREADFUL STORMS NOR ITS CURRENTS AND REEFS INDEED I SAID THIS SEA IS MENTIONED AS ONE OF THE WORST AND IN THE DAYS OF THE ANCIENTS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN IT HAD AN ABOMINABLE REPUTATION THOROUGHLY ABOMINABLE PROFESSOR ARONNAX
I HAD NO TROUBLE IDENTIFYING THEM
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO
TO ANSWER THEM CALLED FOR DISSECTING THIS UNKNOWN MONSTER
WATER IS HIS TRUE ELEMENT AND HE LIVES IN THE SEA MORE THAN ON SHORE GOING CONSTANTLY FROM ONE ISLAND TO ANOTHER EVEN TO CRETE ITALIAN
THESE SEAMEN OBVIOUSLY BELONGED TO DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES ALTHOUGH INDICATIONS OF EUROPEAN PHYSICAL TRAITS COULD BE SEEN IN THEM ALL
SIR HE ANSWERED YOU CAN TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THIS HUNK OF IRON WILL NEVER NAVIGATE AGAIN ON THE SEAS OR UNDER THEM
BUT THEN I SAID DOES THIS CONTRAPTION CONTAIN SOME SORT OF LOCOMOTIVE MECHANISM AND A CREW TO RUN IT APPARENTLY THE HARPOONER REPLIED
IN THE DAYS OF THE PTOLEMIES AND THE ROMAN EMPERORS IT WAS A GREAT COMMERCIAL ARTERY FOR THE WORLD AND WHEN ITS ISTHMUS HAS BEEN CUT THROUGH IT WILL COMPLETELY REGAIN THAT BYGONE IMPORTANCE THAT THE SUEZ RAILWAYS HAVE ALREADY BROUGHT BACK IN PART
THAT A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL HAD SUCH A MECHANISM AT HIS DISPOSAL WAS LESS THAN PROBABLE
FIVE MILES STILL SEPARATED IT FROM US AND ITS BEACH MERGED WITH THE MISTY WATERS
THIS OBSTACLE COULDN'T STOP CAPTAIN NEMO AND HE LAUNCHED HIS SHIP AGAINST THE ICE FIELDS WITH HIDEOUS VIOLENCE
OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS SOME WOOD OR REED HUTS INDICATED THE QUARTER WHERE THE BEDOUINS LIVED
OH MY HEART NEARLY EXPLODED WITH EXCITEMENT AND HORROR
IT WAS APPARENTLY CONSIDERED OUT OF THE QUESTION TO DIVE BY FILLING THE BALLAST TANKS
WE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN LUCKIER IN OUR SEARCH FOR EDIBLE VEGETATION AND SOME OF THE MOST USEFUL PRODUCE IN THE TROPICAL ZONES SUPPLIED US WITH A VALUABLE FOODSTUFF MISSING ON BOARD
GRACIOUS CONSEIL PUT IN A CHOIR OF BULLS NO I SAID A CHOIR OF WALRUSES ARE THEY FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER EITHER FIGHTING OR PLAYING WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER THIS WE MUST SEE THEN SEE IT WE MUST CONSEIL AND THERE WE WERE CLIMBING THESE BLACKISH ROCKS AMID SUDDEN LANDSLIDES AND OVER STONES SLIPPERY WITH ICE
THEIR HUES ARE CONFINED TO A GAMUT OF REDS FROM THE PALLOR OF PINK TO THE GLOW OF RUBY
HE WAS AT WORK
EITHER WE KNOW EVERY VARIETY OF CREATURE POPULATING OUR PLANET OR WE DO NOT
THE NEXT DAY THE OCEAN RESUMED ITS USUAL APPEARANCE
WE WERE ABREAST OF THE TIP OF SOUTH AMERICA BY MARCH 31 AT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
WELL HAVE I CONVINCED YOU YOU'VE CONVINCED ME OF ONE THING MR NATURALIST
ABOVE US THERE APPEARED AN IDENTICAL BAND THAT DUPLICATED OUR EVERY MOVEMENT AND GESTURE
THE SHIP SCUDDED ALONG LIKE AN AIR BALLOON BORNE BY THE WIND OVER SOME PRAIRIE ON LAND
NO FIRES TO FEAR BECAUSE THIS SUBMERSIBLE IS MADE OF SHEET IRON NOT WOOD
ALTHOUGH THIS FEAT IS FICTITIOUS IT WILL SOMEDAY COME TRUE BECAUSE IT'S LIKELY THAT BY HUNTING WHALES IN THE ARCTIC OR ANTARCTIC REGIONS MAN WILL FINALLY REACH THIS UNKNOWN SPOT ON THE GLOBE
IT'S DIVING NED LAND EXCLAIMED
SIR EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE CUT YOURSELF OFF FROM HUMANITY I CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVEN'T DISOWNED ALL HUMAN FEELING
I THOUGHT I HADN'T HEARD HIM RIGHT BUT I COULDN'T REPEAT MY COMMENT BECAUSE THE CAPTAIN'S HEAD HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED INTO ITS METAL COVERING
AS FOR THE ARTICULATES IN HIS NOTES CONSEIL HAS VERY APPROPRIATELY DIVIDED THEM INTO SIX CLASSES THREE OF WHICH BELONG TO THE MARINE WORLD
HIS LOOKS CAUGHT THE ATTENTION AND ABOVE ALL THE STRENGTH OF HIS GAZE WHICH GAVE A UNIQUE EMPHASIS TO HIS FACIAL APPEARANCE
OUR FISHERMEN FREQUENTLY SEE SPECIMENS OVER 1.8 METERS LONG
THIS STREAM OF ELECTRICITY DAZZLED MY EYES AND AFTER MOMENTARILY SHUTTING THEM I LOOKED AROUND
NOBODY KNEW
MY ANXIETY AND AGITATION WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE GIVEN ME AWAY IF CAPTAIN NEMO HAD SEEN ME
THE SEA IS A VAST POOL OF NATURE
THE FIRST HULL HAS A THICKNESS OF NO LESS THAN FIVE CENTIMETERS AND WEIGHS 394.96 METRIC TONS
I TRIED IN VAIN TO FALL ASLEEP
A MAN
RAYS INCLUDING SPOTTED RAYS THAT WERE OVAL IN SHAPE AND BRICK RED IN COLOR THEIR BODIES STREWN WITH ERRATIC BLUE SPECKLES AND IDENTIFIABLE BY THEIR JAGGED DOUBLE STINGS SILVER-BACKED SKATES COMMON STINGRAYS WITH STIPPLED TAILS BUTTERFLY RAYS THAT LOOKED LIKE HUGE TWO-METER CLOAKS FLAPPING AT MIDDEPTH TOOTHLESS GUITARFISH THAT WERE A TYPE OF CARTILAGINOUS FISH CLOSER TO THE SHARK TRUNKFISH KNOWN AS DROMEDARIES THAT WERE ONE AND A HALF FEET LONG AND HAD HUMPS ENDING IN BACKWARD-CURVING STINGS SERPENTINE MORAY EELS WITH SILVER TAILS AND BLUISH BACKS PLUS BROWN PECTORALS TRIMMED IN GRAY PIPING A SPECIES OF BUTTERFISH CALLED THE FIATOLA DECKED OUT IN THIN GOLD STRIPES AND THE THREE COLORS OF THE FRENCH FLAG MONTAGUE BLENNIES FOUR DECIMETERS LONG SUPERB JACKS HANDSOMELY EMBELLISHED BY SEVEN BLACK CROSSWISE STREAKS WITH BLUE AND YELLOW FINS PLUS GOLD AND SILVER SCALES SNOOKS STANDARD MULLET WITH YELLOW HEADS PARROTFISH WRASSE TRIGGERFISH GOBIES ETC PLUS A THOUSAND OTHER
I ASK ONLY TO LIVE 100 YEARS MORE THE LONGER TO REMEMBER YOU
YOUR FOUR VERSIONS OF THE SAME NARRATIVE PERFECTLY CONSISTENT BY AND LARGE ESTABLISHED YOUR PERSONAL IDENTITIES FOR ME
THESE WALLS WERE THE EXPRESS ACHIEVEMENTS OF MADREPORES KNOWN BY THE NAMES FIRE CORAL FINGER CORAL STAR CORAL AND STONY CORAL
CARRIED BY AN INBOUND CURRENT THE LONGBOAT REACHED THE ISLAND IN A MATTER OF MOMENTS
WITH PANTING CHESTS AND ANXIOUS EYES WE EACH WOULD OBSERVE THE CETACEAN'S MOVEMENTS
SWIFT CURRENTS SWEPT AWAY ALL THIS DIFFUSE GAS AND TORRENTS OF LAVA SLID TO THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN LIKE THE DISGORGINGS OF A MT
SO IT WAS A PROMISING OPPORTUNITY DESPITE THE THIRTY MILES THAT SEPARATED THE NAUTILUS FROM THESE UNION COASTS
THERE I SAW SOME MAGNIFICENT BIRDS SOARING ALOFT THE ARRANGEMENT OF THEIR LONG FEATHERS CAUSING THEM TO HEAD INTO THE WIND
SO IT MUST BE A RARITY OR SOMETHING THE CANADIAN ASKED IN THE TONE OF A HUNTER WHO FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF HIS ART GIVES THE GAME A PRETTY LOW RATING
TO MY MIND IT WOULD LEAD NOWHERE
IN OLDEN TIMES FINE FABRICS STOCKINGS AND GLOVES WERE MADE FROM SUCH FILAMENTS BECAUSE THEY WERE BOTH VERY SOFT AND VERY WARM
AN IRON LADDER CLAMPED TO THE WALL LED TO THE SHAFT'S UPPER END
TWENTY MINUTES LATER WE BOARDED SHIP
SNATCHING ONLY A FEW MINUTES FOR MEALS AND A FEW HOURS FOR SLEEP COME RAIN OR COME SHINE I NO LONGER LEFT THE SHIP'S DECK
SWATHED IN BLOOD-SOAKED LINEN HIS HEAD WAS RESTING ON A FOLDED PILLOW
A FEW PACES AWAY A MONSTROUS METER-HIGH SEA SPIDER WAS STARING AT ME WITH BEADY EYES POISED TO SPRING AT ME
A SHIP I EXCLAIMED
I BENT OVER HIM
I SAW A FEW THAT HAD SUNK STRAIGHT DOWN THEIR MASTING STILL UPRIGHT THEIR RIGGING STIFFENED BY THE WATER
THIS FRUIT CONTAINED NO PITS
BY THEN WE HAD FARED NEARLY 13,000 LEAGUES FROM OUR STARTING POINT IN THE PACIFIC HIGH SEAS
THERE'S THE THING IN QUESTION ABREAST OF US TO LEEWARD CHAPTER 6 AT FULL STEAM AT THIS SHOUT THE ENTIRE CREW RUSHED TOWARD THE HARPOONER COMMANDER OFFICERS MATES SAILORS CABIN BOYS DOWN TO ENGINEERS LEAVING THEIR MACHINERY AND STOKERS NEGLECTING THEIR FURNACES
NOW THEN THE BIGGEST WHALES THOSE RORQUAL WHALES THAT FREQUENT THE WATERWAYS OF THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS HAVE NEVER EXCEEDED A LENGTH OF 56 METERS--IF THEY REACH EVEN THAT
CAPTAIN NEMO WAS OBVIOUSLY FAMILIAR WITH THIS BIVALVE'S EXISTENCE
A POWERFUL SPYGLASS TO HIS EYE HE SCRUTINIZED EVERY POINT OF THE HORIZON WITH THE UTMOST CARE
A VALUABLE SPECIES THAT PATRONIZES ALL WATERS FRESH OR SALT EQUALLY AT HOME IN RIVERS LAKES AND OCEANS LIVING IN EVERY CLIME TOLERATING ANY TEMPERATURE THEIR LINE DATING BACK TO PREHISTORIC TIMES ON THIS EARTH YET PRESERVING ALL ITS BEAUTY FROM THOSE FAR-OFF DAYS
I TRIED TO PUSH THE DEVICE AWAY
THESE BALLAST TANKS EXIST WITHIN EASY ACCESS IN THE LOWER REACHES OF THE NAUTILUS
AH SIR LIVE
HE HAD MADE ME IF NOT AN ACCOMPLICE AT LEAST AN EYEWITNESS TO HIS VENGEANCE
THEN I FELT MYSELF BEING PULLED UPWARD BACK TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
I ESTIMATE THAT WE COVERED A DISTANCE OF AT LEAST 500 KILOMETERS DURING THIS ILL-FATED DAY OF NOVEMBER 6
THE LATEST WONDER IS ALWAYS THE MOST ASTONISHING AND IF THIS PROGRESSION KEEPS UP I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT ITS CLIMAX WILL BE
IN ESSENCE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME SEVERAL SHIPS HAD ENCOUNTERED AN ENORMOUS THING AT SEA A LONG SPINDLE-SHAPED OBJECT SOMETIMES GIVING OFF A PHOSPHORESCENT GLOW INFINITELY BIGGER AND FASTER THAN ANY WHALE
ITS DISTANCE STILL KEPT US FROM DISTINGUISHING THE COLORS OF ITS PENNANT WHICH WAS FLUTTERING LIKE A THIN RIBBON
I'LL MENTION CHIEFLY SOME TRUNKFISH UNIQUE TO THE RED SEA THE SEA OF THE EAST INDIES AND THAT PART OF THE OCEAN WASHING THE COASTS OF EQUINOCTIAL AMERICA
I LEFT THE TABLE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
I REALIZED THAT HE WAS STANDING UP
SUDDENLY A HISSING SOUND WAS AUDIBLE AND THE DUGONG DISAPPEARED
SIR I SAID COOLLY I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU ON A MATTER THAT SIMPLY CAN'T WAIT WHATEVER COULD THAT BE SIR HE REPLIED SARCASTICALLY
SO IT ISN'T QUITE BUILT ON THE TEN-TO-ONE RATIO OF YOUR HIGH-SPEED STEAMERS
BETWEEN THEM JOINING THEM TOGETHER ARE IRON T-BARS THAT GIVE THIS SHIP THE UTMOST RIGIDITY
IT ALSO GOT MORE UNPREDICTABLE OFTEN TAKING US TO GREAT DEPTHS
WHAT'S MORE VERNE ADDS BACKBONE TO THE ACTION BY DEVELOPING THREE RECURRING MOTIFS
I UNDERSTAND LESS HOW YOU CAN CHASE AQUATIC GAME IN YOUR UNDERWATER FORESTS
HIS FACE HAD RESUMED ITS USUAL EMOTIONLESSNESS
YELLOW MACKEREL WITH WINGS MADE OF FILAMENTS
I WAS OUTDOING HIM IN DARING
I'VE SEVERED ALL TIES WITH SOCIETY FOR REASONS THAT I ALONE HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPRECIATE
HIS EYES NEVER LEFT THAT VESSEL
SO NO ANSWER WAS CALLED FOR
SOME KINGFISHERS LURKED ALONG THE WATERCOURSES BUT THEY DIDN'T LET US APPROACH
IT'S FLYING NO FLAG
I HURRIED TO FIND OUT THE NAUTILUS'S HEADING
THERE'S NOTHING IN SIGHT AND IN TRUTH THE OCEAN WAS DESERTED
HERE AND THERE OPALINE HUES OF INFINITE SUBTLETY RACED AMONG SPARKS OF LIGHT THAT WERE LIKE SO MANY FIERY DIAMONDS THEIR BRILLIANCE MORE THAN ANY EYE COULD STAND
TRULY IF THAT GALLANT LAD HAD OWNED GILLS INSTEAD OF LUNGS I THINK HE WOULD HAVE MADE AN OUTSTANDING FISH
JUST THEN WE WENT AROUND THE HIGHEST RIDGE OF THESE ROCKY FOOTHILLS THAT SUPPORTED THE VAULT
I FELT AN UNBEARABLE QUEASINESS
A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE TWO OF THEM REAPPEARED ON THE PLATFORM
HE SEEMED IMPATIENT BAFFLED
THEN IT HITS THE COAST OF AFRICA SWEEPS IN A LONG OVAL AND RETURNS TO THE CARIBBEAN SEA
TWO STRANDS MADE OF A HORN SUBSTANCE COVERED WITH DOWN ROSE OVER ITS TAIL WHICH WAS LENGTHENED BY LONG VERY LIGHT FEATHERS OF WONDERFUL FINENESS AND THEY COMPLETED THE COSTUME OF THIS MARVELOUS BIRD THAT THE ISLANDERS HAVE POETICALLY NAMED THE SUN BIRD HOW I WISHED I COULD TAKE THIS SUPERB BIRD OF PARADISE BACK TO PARIS TO MAKE A GIFT OF IT TO THE ZOO AT THE BOTANICAL GARDENS WHICH DOESN'T OWN A SINGLE LIVE SPECIMEN
HOW LONG DO YOU FIGURE THEY'LL KEEP US IN THIS IRON BOX TO TELL THE TRUTH FRIEND LAND I KNOW LITTLE MORE ABOUT IT THAN YOU DO BUT IN A NUTSHELL WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE IS GOING ON MY SUPPOSITION IS THAT SHEER CHANCE HAS MADE US PRIVY TO AN IMPORTANT SECRET
JUST THEN IGNORING MY PRESENCE THE CAPTAIN OPENED THIS CABINET A SORT OF SAFE THAT CONTAINED A LARGE NUMBER OF INGOTS
SHORTAGE OF AIR 252 17
THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN
YOU'RE GOING TO VOYAGE THROUGH A LAND OF WONDERS
JUST THEN THE NAUTILUS HAD ARRIVED AT THE PERPENDICULAR FACE OF THAT HIGH WALL
THE ENORMOUS SHEET-IRON CYLINDER SEEMED DESERTED
THE FULL TRUTH DAWNED ON ME
ACCORDINGLY I'M IN THE HABIT OF STAYING IN THE PILOTHOUSE AND DIRECTING MANEUVERS MYSELF
THERE PICTURESQUE RUINS TOOK SHAPE BETRAYING THE HAND OF MAN NOT OUR CREATOR
I HAD CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM JUST AS THE CHIEF OFFICER WAS TAKING HIS READINGS OF HOUR ANGLES
I FELT MY NAKED FEET CLINGING TO THE STEPS OF AN IRON LADDER
PEOPLE MISTAKE THEM FOR ISLETS
HERE WE ARE THE CAPTAIN SAID
STAY HERE MY FRIENDS I SAID STOPPING THEM
BREAKFAST OVER I MADE MY WAY ASHORE
THE DOOR CLOSED AGAIN
THE WIND SHIFTED ABRUPTLY TO EVERY POINT ON THE COMPASS
INNER BOILINGS SENT QUICK SHIVERS RUNNING THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN'S CRUST
WE COULD COUNT SEVERAL HUNDRED OF THEM
SO IT WISELY STAYED IN MIDWATER
THE CANADIAN SIGHTED NOTHING NEW ON THE HORIZON NEITHER SAIL NOR SHORE
WAS HE A FIGHTER FOR OPPRESSED PEOPLES A LIBERATOR OF ENSLAVED RACES
AT FIRST CAPTAIN NEMO ATE WITHOUT PRONOUNCING A SINGLE WORD
IT GOES TO THE SKIFF HE REPLIED
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A STEAMER ON ONE OF THOSE LINES OUT OF NEW YORK TO LIVERPOOL OR LE HAVRE
I WENT DOWN THE GANGWAYS AND ARRIVED AT THE MUSEUM WHERE I HAD SPENT SO MANY PLEASANT AND PRODUCTIVE HOURS
HERE THE GULF STREAM WIDENS
CAPTAIN NEMO WAS WAITING FOR ME
DURING THIS PHASE OF OUR VOYAGE CAPTAIN NEMO CONDUCTED INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS ON THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES IN VARIOUS STRATA OF THE SEA
IT TOOK ME FIVE MINUTES TO REACH THE DOOR AT THE FAR END WHICH LED INTO THE LIBRARY
NEAR 5:30 THE FIRST GLIMMERS OF LIGHT ON THE HORIZON DEFINED THE UPPER LINES OF THE COAST WITH GREATER DISTINCTNESS
THE NAUTILUS WAS NO LONGER MOVING
I MIGHT ADD I WENT ON THAT THERE'S A SIMILAR BARRIER BETWEEN GIBRALTAR AND CEUTA AND IN PREHISTORIC TIMES IT CLOSED OFF THE MEDITERRANEAN COMPLETELY GRACIOUS CONSEIL PUT IN
THEY ARE SHELTERED NURTURED FLATTERED PAMPERED AND OFFERED A RITUAL DIET OF NUBILE MAIDENS
WHEN THE LAST TIPS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS HAD DISAPPEARED BELOW THE HORIZON THE NAUTILUS SUBMERGED TO A DEPTH BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY-FIVE METERS AND WENT ALONG THE SOUTH AMERICAN COAST
NOW THEN SINCE THESE ICE MOUNTAINS DON'T EXCEED A HEIGHT OF 100 METERS THEY SINK ONLY TO A DEPTH OF 300 METERS
IT WAS BECOMING HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE
HOPE AND FEAR BESIEGED ME BY TURNS
FOR AN ENTIRE HOUR I WAS DEEP IN THESE MUSINGS TRYING TO PROBE THIS MYSTERY THAT FASCINATED ME SO
SOON THE CANADIAN ANNOUNCED THAT THE CRAFT WAS A BIG BATTLESHIP A DOUBLE-DECKER IRONCLAD COMPLETE WITH RAM
WE PASSED FREELY UNDER THEIR LOFTY BOUGHS LOST UP IN THE SHADOWS OF THE WAVES WHILE AT OUR FEET ORGAN-PIPE CORAL STONY CORAL STAR CORAL FUNGUS CORAL AND SEA ANEMONE FROM THE GENUS CARYOPHYLIA FORMED A CARPET OF FLOWERS ALL STREWN WITH DAZZLING GEMS
THIS NOOSE SLID AS FAR AS THE CAUDAL FINS AND CAME TO A HALT
OUR COURSE WAS SET FOR THE NORTHWEST AND THE NEXT DAY OUR FRIGATE'S PROPELLER FINALLY CHURNED THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC
WHAT A SUPPLY FOR THE NAUTILUS
DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW THAT I'M RICH TO THE TUNE OF BILLIONS I UNDERSTAND CAPTAIN
MOREOVER THE MOON THEN DISAPPEARED AND LEFT US IN PROFOUND DARKNESS
MY COMPANIONS KEPT THEIR SEATS AND DIDN'T MOVE
ABREAST OF LATITUDE 60 DEGREES EVERY PASSAGEWAY HAD DISAPPEARED
NOTHING ON THE HORIZON EXCEPT NEAR FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON A LONG STEAMER TO THE WEST RUNNING ON OUR OPPOSITE TACK
THE ENTIRE HORIZON WAS HIDDEN BEHIND A CURTAIN OF WONDERFUL FORESTS
SO I COULDN'T ENTERTAIN THIS IDEA OF LEAVING THE NAUTILUS BEFORE COMPLETING OUR COURSE OF INQUIRY
THUS WE WENT AS DEEP AS TWO OR THREE KILOMETERS DOWN BUT WITHOUT EVER VERIFYING THE LOWEST DEPTHS OF THIS SEA NEAR INDIA WHICH SOUNDINGS OF 13,000 METERS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REACH
AS FOR ME DEEPLY PUZZLED I WENT BELOW TO THE LOUNGE AND BROUGHT BACK AN EXCELLENT LONG-RANGE TELESCOPE I HABITUALLY USED
AH I PUT IN
TONIGHT
WELL RECEIVED IN SCHOLARLY CIRCLES THIS BOOK HAD ESTABLISHED ME AS A SPECIALIST IN THIS PRETTY OBSCURE FIELD OF NATURAL HISTORY
YES I REPLIED
THE SKIFF STILL ATTACHED TO THE SHIP'S PLATING WAS LIKEWISE CARRIED AROUND AT DIZZYING SPEED
WITH HIS EYE AND HIS THROWING ARM HE WAS WORTH THE WHOLE CREW ALL BY HIMSELF
TO THE SOUTH AND EAST HEADS OF CORAL WERE ALREADY ON DISPLAY LEFT UNCOVERED BY THE EBBING WATERS
THE NAUTILUS'S POWERFUL PUMPS FORCED AIR DOWN INTO THE TANKS AND STORED IT UNDER HIGH PRESSURE
AT FIRST I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS SUDDEN ASSAULT BUT I WAS REASSURED TO OBSERVE THE CAPTAIN LYING MOTIONLESS BESIDE ME
WORDS ARE POWERLESS TO DESCRIBE SUCH WONDERS
HOW COULD ELECTRICITY WORK WITH SUCH POWER
FROM THIS COLLECTION OF PORTRAITS COULD I FINALLY UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF HIS EXISTENCE
SURELY WITH SOME NEW BREED OF PIRATES EXPLOITING THE SEA AFTER THEIR OWN FASHION
THE UNDERWATER HUNTING TRIP THE TORRES STRAIT OUR RUNNING AGROUND THE SAVAGES OF PAPUA THE CORAL CEMETERY THE SUEZ PASSAGEWAY THE ISLAND OF SANTORINI THE CRETAN DIVER THE BAY OF VIGO ATLANTIS THE ICE BANK THE SOUTH POLE OUR IMPRISONMENT IN THE ICE THE BATTLE WITH THE DEVILFISH THE STORM IN THE GULF STREAM THE AVENGER AND THAT HORRIBLE SCENE OF THE VESSEL SINKING WITH ITS CREW
I SAW THE BOTTOM OF HIS DINGHY MOORED A FEW FEET ABOVE HIS HEAD
AHOY
I OBSERVED HIM WITH GREAT CARE
TWO DAYS PASSED
MOLLUSKS WERE REPRESENTED BY VARIETIES OF SQUID THAT ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR ORBIGNY ARE UNIQUE TO THE RED SEA
BY NOON WE WERE NO FARTHER ALONG THAN AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
CHAPTER 24 THE CORAL REALM THE NEXT DAY I WOKE UP WITH MY HEAD UNUSUALLY CLEAR
BUT I MUST SAY THAT NATURALISTS ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT ON THE STRUCTURAL MODE OF SPONGES
ABSOLUTELY NOT
OUR NETS ALSO HAULED IN A BOLD DARING VIGOROUS AND MUSCULAR FISH ARMED WITH PRICKLES ON ITS HEAD AND STINGS ON ITS FINS A REAL SCORPION MEASURING TWO TO THREE METERS THE RUTHLESS ENEMY OF COD BLENNIES AND SALMON
WHERE WAS CAPTAIN NEMO
PERHAPS THAT THIS APPROACHING SHORE WAS TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT CONTRARY TO THE CANADIAN'S VIEWS IN WHICH IT STILL SEEMED TOO FAR AWAY
THAT SAME YEAR THE AMERICAN MORREL WHOSE REPORTS ARE DUBIOUS WENT ALONG THE 42ND MERIDIAN FINDING OPEN SEA AT LATITUDE 70 DEGREES 14 IN 1825 THE ENGLISHMAN POWELL WAS UNABLE TO GET BEYOND 62 DEGREES
THE PRESSURE GAUGE MARKED TEN ATMOSPHERES
HIS CHIEF OFFICER REGULARLY FIXED THE POSITIONS I FOUND REPORTED ON THE CHART AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT I COULD EXACTLY PLOT THE NAUTILUS'S COURSE
I KEPT SEARCHING FOR A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE APPEARANCE OF THE DIVER AND THAT CHEST FILLED WITH GOLD
BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH WEARING THESE HEAVY DIVING SUITS YOU NO LONGER FEEL THE LIQUID ELEMENT YOU SIMPLY THINK YOU'RE IN THE MIDST OF AIR A LITTLE DENSER THAN AIR ON LAND THAT'S ALL
THIS FLOUR WAS THE STARCH-LIKE SAGO AN EDIBLE SUBSTANCE CHIEFLY CONSUMED BY THE MELANESIAN PEOPLES
I COULD THEN SEE OUR IMAGES CLEARLY MIRRORED ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE WAVES BUT REFLECTED UPSIDE DOWN
ONE OF OUR NETS HAD HAULED UP A TYPE OF VERY FLAT RAY THAT WEIGHED SOME TWENTY KILOGRAMS
THE NEXT DAY MARCH 22 AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE BEGAN
YOU EXPECT US TO FALL FOR THAT NOT TOO TERRIBLY NED LAND REPLIED AND NO MORE THAN IF I TOLD YOU THERE ARE WHALES THAT ARE 300 FEET LONG AND WEIGH 1,000,000 POUNDS THAT'S INDEED CONSIDERABLE I SAID
IT WAS A HEAVY RAINFALL RATTLING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
AMONG THESE BOOKS I NOTED MASTERPIECES BY THE GREATS OF ANCIENT AND MODERN TIMES IN OTHER WORDS ALL OF HUMANITY'S FINEST ACHIEVEMENTS IN HISTORY POETRY FICTION AND SCIENCE FROM HOMER TO VICTOR HUGO FROM XENOPHON TO MICHELET FROM RABELAIS TO MADAME GEORGE SAND
MOREOVER THE SOLUTION IT PROPOSED ALLOWED FOR FREE PLAY OF THE IMAGINATION
THE OARS HUNG SUSPENDED ABOVE THEIR ROWLOCKS
ONLY HE NEVER TOOK THE HAND I EXTENDED TO HIM
WHAT CREATURES INHABIT OR COULD INHABIT THOSE REGIONS TWELVE OR FIFTEEN MILES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
WHAT CREATURES INHABIT OR COULD INHABIT THOSE REGIONS TWELVE OR FIFTEEN MILES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
42 DEGREES CENTIGRADE HE SAID
ON APRIL 16 OF THAT SAME YEAR IT JOINED THE SQUADRON AT BREST UNDER REAR ADMIRAL VILLARET DE JOYEUSE WHO WAS ENTRUSTED WITH ESCORTING A CONVOY OF WHEAT COMING FROM AMERICA UNDER THE COMMAND OF ADMIRAL VAN STABEL
WE HAD LIVED OFF THE SHIP'S STORES FOR FIVE DAYS
IN 65 JUST TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO I TO WHOM YOU SPEAK I MYSELF STEPPED ONTO THE CARCASS OF A WHALE NEAR GREENLAND AND ITS FLANK STILL CARRIED THE MARKED HARPOON OF A WHALING SHIP FROM THE BERING SEA
FOR AN HOUR WE WENT ALONG IT IN THIS FASHION STAYING ONLY A FEW METERS AWAY
BY THEN THE NAUTILUS LAY HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM THE NEAREST COAST
AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I WAS AWAKENED BY A VIOLENT COLLISION
SHADOWS GATHERED AND GLOOM OVERRAN THE SEA UNTIL THE MOON CAME UP
SOMETIMES AN UNPREDICTABLE IRREGULARITY IN THE SEAFLOOR WOULD FORCE THE NAUTILUS TO SLOW DOWN AND THEN IT WOULD GLIDE INTO THE NARROW CHANNELS BETWEEN THE HILLS WITH A CETACEAN'S DEXTERITY
OR PROCEEDING IN A MORE CONVENIENT MORE ECONOMICAL AND CONSEQUENTLY MORE PROBABLE FASHION WAS HE SATISFIED WITH MERELY RETURNING TO BREATHE AT THE SURFACE OF THE WATER LIKE A CETACEAN RENEWING HIS OXYGEN SUPPLY EVERY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
ACCORDINGLY I THINK AS MUCH ABOUT STAYING AS MR LAND ABOUT MAKING HIS ESCAPE
HE ADDRESSED A FEW WORDS TO HIS CHIEF OFFICER IN THEIR STRANGE LANGUAGE THEN HE TURNED TO ME
DID THE CAPTAIN MEAN TO KEEP US ON BOARD HIS VESSEL PERMANENTLY
FOR MY PART I WAS NO LONGER WORRIED ABOUT THOSE DANGERS MY IMAGINATION HAD SO RIDICULOUSLY EXAGGERATED
CAPTAIN NEMO'S COMPANION PICKED UP THE ANIMAL LOADED IT ON HIS SHOULDER AND WE TOOK TO THE TRAIL AGAIN
THEN TURNING TOWARD THE ORB OF DAY WHOSE LAST RAYS WERE LICKING AT THE SEA'S HORIZON
NOW THEN LATE IN 1702 SPAIN WAS EXPECTING A RICH CONVOY WHICH FRANCE VENTURED TO ESCORT WITH A FLEET OF TWENTY-THREE VESSELS UNDER THE COMMAND OF ADMIRAL DE CHATEAU-RENAULT BECAUSE BY THAT TIME THE ALLIED NAVIES WERE ROVING THE ATLANTIC
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN I RECOGNIZED SOME IRISHMEN SOME FRENCHMEN A FEW SLAVS AND A NATIVE OF EITHER GREECE OR CRETE
ALL IN ALL THIS REPLY TOLD ME NOTHING
CIVILIZATION NED LAND TOLD ME THAT DAY
WE'VE SEEN PROGRESS IN SONAR TORPEDOES AND OTHER BELLIGERENT MACHINERY BUT SAILORS AND SCIENTISTS TO SAY NOTHING OF TOURISTS--HAVE YET TO VOYAGE IN A SUBMARINE WITH THE LUXURY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE NAUTILUS
GO BELOW HE TOLD ME IN A CURT TONE
BUT I SAW THEIR NUMBERS SWELL CONSIDERABLY ON THE BEACH
FINALLY THIS LONG NIGHT WAS OVER
BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENED WHO KNEW IF WE MIGHT NOT HIT THE UNDERBELLY OF THE ICE BANK AND BE HIDEOUSLY SQUEEZED BETWEEN TWO FROZEN SURFACES
OH BRAVO CONSEIL I EXCLAIMED
GET UP SHOUTED THE FINE LAD
THE WATER'S COMING UP TO US I GOT BACK ON MY FEET
THE NETS WERE HAULED ON BOARD
HERE PROFESSOR ARONNAX ARE THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF THIS BOAT NOW TRANSPORTING YOU
MY BAGGAGE WASN'T HEAVY
ARMED WITH BOWS ARROWS AND SHIELDS NEARLY ALL OF THEM CARRIED FROM THEIR SHOULDERS A SORT OF NET WHICH HELD THOSE POLISHED STONES THEIR SLINGS HURL WITH SUCH DEXTERITY
WELL SIR NED LAND SAID TO ME COMING UP AFTER THE CAPTAIN'S DEPARTURE
MEANWHILE WE WENT EVER ONWARD AND THESE VAST PLAINS OF SAND SEEMED ENDLESS
IN THE MIDST OF THEIR GLOOMY RUBBLE THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED AS IF PASSING THE DEAD IN REVIEW
AND AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING AFTER THE LIGHTS OF FIRE ISLAND HAD VANISHED INTO THE NORTHWEST WE RAN AT FULL STEAM ONTO THE DARK WATERS OF THE ATLANTIC
THE ST LAWRENCE MISSISSIPPI AMAZON PLATA ORINOCO NIGER SENEGAL ELBE LOIRE AND RHINE WHICH BRING IT WATERS FROM THE MOST CIVILIZED COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE MOST UNDEVELOPED AREAS
YES SOMETIMES THE CAPTAIN REPLIED
I COULD CLEARLY DISTINGUISH THE TILLED SOIL ON ITS OUTSKIRTS THE VARIOUS MOUNTAIN CHAINS RUNNING PARALLEL WITH ITS COASTLINE AND ITS VOLCANOES CROWNED BY MAUNA KEA WHOSE ELEVATION IS 5,000 METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL
SO PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE WENT ON AFTER THINKING FOR A FEW MOMENTS YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY CAN'T ESCAPE FROM THEIR PRISON NO MY FRIEND EASY
CONSEQUENTLY I DECIDED TO DIVIDE OUR ENERGIES SO WE WOULDN'T BOTH BE WORN OUT AT THE SAME TIME AND THIS WAS THE ARRANGEMENT
PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE SAID TO ME ARE YOU READY TO START I'M READY KINDLY FOLLOW ME WHAT ABOUT MY COMPANIONS CAPTAIN THEY'VE BEEN ALERTED AND ARE WAITING FOR US AREN'T WE GOING TO PUT ON OUR DIVING SUITS I ASKED
THEY'RE MY SOLE REMAINING TIES WITH DRY LAND
THE TINIEST OBJECTS REMAINED VISIBLE
BY THEN COMMANDER FARRAGUT NED LAND AND I WERE ON THE AFTERDECK PEERING EAGERLY INTO THE PROFOUND GLOOM
FINISHING HIS INVESTIGATIONS DILLON STAYED AT THE SITE OF THE CASUALTY UNTIL THE MONTH OF OCTOBER
YOU A CANNIBAL
UNDER THESE DARK WATERS THERE STRETCHED THE BANK OF SHELLFISH AN INEXHAUSTIBLE FIELD OF PEARLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILES LONG
IN TRUTH THIS ANIMAL IS A LIVING FISHHOOK PROMISING WEALTH AND HAPPINESS TO THE GREENEST FISHERMAN IN THE BUSINESS
ITS ANIMAL NATURE ISN'T IN DOUBT AND WE CAN'T ACCEPT EVEN THE VIEWS OF THE ANCIENTS WHO REGARDED IT AS HALFWAY BETWEEN PLANT AND ANIMAL
I REALIZED THAT THE SKIFF WAS BEING DETACHED AND LAUNCHED TO SEA
THE ZOOPHYTE BRANCH OFFERED SOME VERY UNUSUAL SPECIMENS FROM ITS TWO GROUPS THE POLYPS AND THE ECHINODERMS
YOU COULD TELL THAT SOME PANELS WERE SHIFTING OVER THE NAUTILUS'S SIDES
IF MASTER WOULD OBLIGE ME BY LEANING ON MY SHOULDER MASTER WILL SWIM WITH MUCH GREATER EASE WITH ONE HAND I SEIZED THE ARM OF MY LOYAL CONSEIL
THEN AMONG THIS BASALTIC ROCK THERE SNAKED LONG HARDENED LAVA FLOWS INLAID WITH VEINS OF BITUMINOUS COAL AND IN PLACES COVERED BY WIDE CARPETS OF SULFUR
STANDING BY THE PORT DEADLIGHT I SPOTTED MAGNIFICENT CORAL SUBSTRUCTURES ZOOPHYTES ALGAE AND CRUSTACEANS WITH ENORMOUS QUIVERING CLAWS THAT STRETCHED FORTH FROM CREVICES IN THE ROCK
THE NAUTILUS TACKED ABOUT AND RETREATED FROM THIS FURNACE IT COULDN'T BRAVE WITH IMPUNITY
I'D SAY AT LEAST BREAKFAST TIME BECAUSE WE'VE CERTAINLY WOKEN UP TO A NEW DAY WHICH INDICATES CONSEIL REPLIED THAT WE'VE SPENT TWENTY-FOUR HOURS IN SLUMBER THAT'S MY ASSESSMENT I REPLIED
PASSING NEAR THESE UNUSUAL ANIMALS I COULD EXAMINE THEM AT MY LEISURE SINCE THEY DIDN'T STIR
AS WE MOVED FORWARD I HEARD A KIND OF PITTER-PATTER ABOVE MY HEAD
THE MONSTER QUESTION INFLAMED ALL MINDS
HALF A DAY'S DELAY WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFORGIVABLE
BUT JUST THEN THE NAUTILUS'S SLANTING FINS TOOK US TO GREAT DEPTHS AND I COULD SEE NOTHING OF THOSE HIGH CORAL WALLS
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS AN ISSUE OF GOING INTO THE WOODS ON SOME HARMLESS FOX HUNT
I KNOCKED ON HIS DOOR
COMMANDER FARRAGUT WAS NO LONGER CONTENT SIMPLY TO TWIST HIS GOATEE
THESE COMPOSERS CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED ME ARE THE CONTEMPORARIES OF ORPHEUS BECAUSE IN THE ANNALS OF THE DEAD ALL CHRONOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES FADE
I PUSHED THE DOOR OPEN
IT WAS A SUPERB NATURAL CURIOSITY RATHER THAN A LUXURIOUS PIECE OF JEWELRY BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY FEMALE EAR THAT COULD HANDLE IT
WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO SAYING THAT IF YOU COULD REACH SUCH A DEPTH IN THE OCEAN EACH SQUARE CENTIMETER ON YOUR BODY'S SURFACE WOULD BE EXPERIENCING 1,000 KILOGRAMS OF PRESSURE
ITS FURLED SAILS MERGED WITH THE LINES OF ITS YARDARMS
OH GOOD I GET TO GO BEAR HUNTING TOMORROW IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT LIONS ON THE ATLAS PLAINS OR TIGERS IN THE JUNGLES OF INDIA YOU MIGHT SAY
IF ONLY I HAD KNOWN LIKE CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS COMPANION HOW TO EXCHANGE THOUGHTS BY MEANS OF PREARRANGED SIGNALS
TOMORROW ON THE DAY STATED AND AT THE HOUR STATED THE TIDE WILL PEACEFULLY LIFT IT OFF AND IT WILL RESUME ITS NAVIGATING THROUGH THE SEAS CAPTAIN I SAID I DON'T DOUBT TOMORROW CAPTAIN NEMO ADDED STANDING UP TOMORROW AT 2:40 IN THE AFTERNOON THE NAUTILUS WILL FLOAT OFF AND EXIT THE TORRES STRAIT UNDAMAGED PRONOUNCING THESE WORDS IN AN EXTREMELY SHARP TONE CAPTAIN NEMO GAVE ME A CURT BOW
IN PERSON SIR AND STILL AFTER HIS PRIZE THE CANADIAN REPLIED
FINALLY ARCHERFISH WITH LONG TUBULAR SNOUTS REAL OCEANGOING FLYCATCHERS ARMED WITH A RIFLE UNFORESEEN BY EITHER REMINGTON OR CHASSEPOT
BUT NOW IT WAS NO LONGER AN ISSUE OF A SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BUT A QUITE REAL AND SERIOUS DANGER TO BE AVOIDED
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY EGGS HAVE BEEN COUNTED IN A SINGLE FEMALE I'LL GO ALL OUT CONSEIL REPLIED
INEVITABLY THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS OF THE UNDERTAKING BECAME ITS MOST ENERGETIC OPPONENTS
COME HIGHER I FOLLOWED HIM WITH ONE LAST BURST OF ENERGY AND IN A FEW MINUTES I HAD SCALED THE PEAK WHICH CROWNED THE WHOLE ROCKY MASS BY SOME TEN METERS
THIS CANAL SERVED COMMERCE UNTIL THE CENTURY OF ROME'S ANTONINE EMPERORS
IT HAD TO BE A CONTINENT OR AT LEAST AN ISLAND EITHER ONE OF THE CANARIES OR ONE OF THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS
IT DRIFTED BACK AND FORTH RIDING WITH THE WAVES LIKE A CORPSE
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN EVERYTHING
COULDN'T THE HEART OF THE OCEAN HIDE THE LAST-REMAINING VARIETIES OF THESE TITANIC SPECIES FOR WHOM YEARS ARE CENTURIES AND CENTURIES MILLENNIA
IT WILL NEVER DO TO COUNT ON CAPTAIN NEMO'S BENEVOLENCE
AFTER DETERMINING OUR POSITION THE CAPTAIN PRONOUNCED ONLY THESE WORDS
THE CURRENT WAS SLACKING OFF IT WAS ALMOST FULL TIDE
THIS GRIM POSSIBILITY TOOK ON A DREADFUL INTENSITY IN MY MIND AND FIRED BY MY IMAGINATION I FELT AN UNREASONING TERROR RUN THROUGH ME
FIRST LET'S LOOK INTO THIS CRESPO ISLAND I CONSULTED THE WORLD MAP
THAT GLOW IS BASICALLY ELECTRIC IN NATURE
THE NAUTILUS TOOK FULL ADVANTAGE OF THIS COUNTERCURRENT
ITS STEEL MUSCLES WERE CRACKING
AS I MUSED IN THIS WAY TRYING TO ESTABLISH IN MY MEMORY EVERY DETAIL OF THIS IMPRESSIVE LANDSCAPE CAPTAIN NEMO WAS LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON A MOSS-COVERED MONUMENT MOTIONLESS AS IF PETRIFIED IN SOME MUTE TRANCE
MY MIND WAS IN A DAZE
IN THIS STRANGE SETTING CAPTAIN NEMO THEN GREW FANTASTICALLY
BUT FOR A FEW MINUTES I KEPT ACCIDENTALLY CONFUSING THE TWO KINGDOMS MISTAKING ZOOPHYTES FOR WATER PLANTS ANIMALS FOR VEGETABLES
AS FOR OUR NEGLECT OUR ISOLATION IN THE DEPTHS OF THIS CELL I WAS AFRAID TO GUESS AT HOW LONG IT MIGHT LAST
CARRIED AWAY BY CURIOSITY I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND TO TAKE IT WEIGH IT FONDLE IT
I BELIEVE IT'S THE SOLE INJURY THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN HAS SUSTAINED
HAVING NO GUNPOWDER I'VE REPLACED IT WITH AIR AT HIGH PRESSURE WHICH IS ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED ME BY THE NAUTILUS'S PUMPS BUT THIS AIR MUST BE SWIFTLY DEPLETED WELL IN A PINCH CAN'T MY ROUQUAYROL TANK SUPPLY ME WITH MORE
IN CONSEIL I HAD A SEASONED SPECIALIST IN BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION AN ENTHUSIAST WHO COULD RUN WITH ACROBATIC AGILITY UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE LADDER OF BRANCHES GROUPS CLASSES SUBCLASSES ORDERS FAMILIES GENERA SUBGENERA SPECIES AND VARIETIES
THIS ANIMAL THIS MONSTER THIS NATURAL PHENOMENON THAT HAD PUZZLED THE WHOLE SCIENTIFIC WORLD THAT HAD MUDDLED AND MISLED THE MINDS OF SEAMEN IN BOTH HEMISPHERES WAS THERE COULD BE NO ESCAPING IT AN EVEN MORE ASTONISHING PHENOMENON A PHENOMENON MADE BY THE HAND OF MAN
ALL THESE CRUMBLING MASSES WERE COVERED WITH AN ENAMEL POLISHED BY THE ACTION OF UNDERGROUND FIRES AND THEY GLISTENED UNDER THE STREAM OF ELECTRIC LIGHT FROM OUR BEACON
ONE WRONG STEP WOULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS ON THE NARROW PATHS CUT INTO THE SIDES OF THESE CHASMS BUT I WALKED ALONG WITH A FIRM TREAD AND WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST FEELING OF DIZZINESS
I TOLD NED LAND AND CONSEIL THAT FARSEEING NATURE HAD GIVEN THESE MAMMALS A MAJOR ROLE TO PLAY
TOMORROW THE 21ST WAS THE DAY OF THE EQUINOX
THESE ARE EXCLUSIVE CURRENTS THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THEIR TEMPERATURE AND COLOR THE MOST REMARKABLE BEING THE ONE CALLED THE GULF STREAM
OUR WORD OF HONOR WHICH WE SINCERELY WOULD HAVE KEPT
THE FROZEN ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC OCEANS THE INDIAN OCEAN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND THE PACIFIC OCEAN
BY THEN THE NAUTILUS HAD REDUCED SPEED
HE BELIEVED IN IT AS CERTAIN PIOUS WOMEN BELIEVE IN THE LEVIATHAN FROM THE BOOK OF JOB--OUT OF FAITH NOT REASON
THE PROS AND CONS 6 3
SOON THEIR PICKS WERE VIGOROUSLY ATTACKING THIS COMPACT MATTER AND HUGE CHUNKS WERE LOOSENED FROM ITS MASS
I HADN'T SEEN NED LAND
THEN SMALL ALCYON CORAL BELONGING TO THE SPECIES PROCELLARIA PELAGICA ALSO A LARGE NUMBER OF STARFISH UNIQUE TO THESE CLIMES PLUS SOME FEATHER STARS SPANGLING THE SAND
ACCORDINGLY I WAS SURE THAT HE HAD ALREADY RISKED HIS NAUTILUS IN THE MIDST OF THE ANTARCTIC SEAS
AND HOLD ON JUST NOW WE'RE PROCEEDING AT THE MODERATE PACE OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR IT'S MARVELOUS I REPLIED AND I TRULY SEE CAPTAIN HOW RIGHT YOU ARE TO USE THIS FORCE
WILL I FINALLY LEARN THE MAN'S NAME
OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD COME TOGETHER BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD BREAK FREE
AND WHERE IF YOU PLEASE WILL WE BE IN SIX MONTHS MR NATURALIST PERHAPS HERE PERHAPS IN CHINA
A GHASTLY UNEASINESS STOLE THROUGH ME
THE HORIZON GREW WIDER AND CLEARER ALL AT ONCE
SEVERAL TIMES WE GOT WITHIN A FEW FATHOMS OF IT AND THE CANADIAN HOVERED IN READINESS TO STRIKE
PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME I BEG YOU TO SHARE MY BREAKFAST WITHOUT FORMALITY
HAD IT RUN AFOUL OF AN UNDERWATER ROCK OR THE WRECKAGE OF SOME ENORMOUS DERELICT SHIP
THIS WAS NO MERE PHOSPHORESCENT PHENOMENON THAT MUCH WAS UNMISTAKABLE
AND NOW LET'S GET TO WORK FOR TWO HOURS OUR FISHING PROCEEDED ENERGETICALLY BUT WITHOUT BRINGING UP ANY RARITIES
LOOK HERE PROFESSOR ARONNAX SPEAK FRANKLY
BUT TO FIND ALL AT ONCE RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES THAT THE IMPOSSIBLE HAD BEEN MYSTERIOUSLY ACHIEVED BY MAN HIMSELF
SEVERAL TIMES THAT DAY THE NAUTILUS REPEATED THE SAME EXPERIMENT AND ALWAYS IT BUMPED AGAINST THIS SURFACE THAT FORMED A CEILING ABOVE IT
HOWEVER THEY SAY THAT IN 1820 RIGHT IN THESE SOUTHERN SEAS A BALEEN WHALE RUSHED AT THE ESSEX AND PUSHED IT BACKWARD AT A SPEED OF FOUR METERS PER SECOND
ITS WATERS COME TO FULL BLOOM
ITS FINS SET VERTICALLY ITS PROPELLER THROWN IN GEAR AT THE CAPTAIN'S SIGNAL THE NAUTILUS ROSE WITH LIGHTNING SPEED SHOOTING UPWARD LIKE AN AIR BALLOON INTO THE SKY
ALWAYS AMID THE HIGH ARCTIC MISTS
CONSEIL EVERLASTINGLY PRUDENT FORCE-FED HIMSELF
WITH ITS BRIGHT COLORS IT LIVED UP TO THOSE POETIC NAMES OF BLOOD FLOWER AND BLOOD FOAM THAT THE INDUSTRY CONFERS ON ITS FINEST EXHIBITS
AT THE MOUTH OF A HOLE CUT IN THE TRUNK OF A DRAGON TREE THERE SWARMED THOUSANDS OF THESE INGENIOUS INSECTS SO COMMON TO ALL THE CANARY ISLANDS WHERE THEIR OUTPUT IS ESPECIALLY PRIZED
THE ARGONAUT IS FREE TO LEAVE ITS SHELL I TOLD CONSEIL BUT IT NEVER DOES NOT UNLIKE CAPTAIN NEMO CONSEIL REPLIED SAGELY
IT'S SELF-ADHERING AND NOT DEPENDENT ON THE TIGHTNESS OF ITS RIVETS
THESE ARE CAUSED CHIEFLY BY MELTING ICE WHICH KEEPS THE AIR EXTREMELY DAMP
SOME AUTHORS MORE ARTISTIC THAN SCIENTIFIC--CLAIM THAT THESE FISH ARE MELODIOUS SINGERS THAT THEIR VOICES IN UNISON PUT ON CONCERTS UNMATCHED BY HUMAN CHORISTERS
LIKE LITTLE DOMES OF LEAD MY LIDS FELL OVER MY EYES
MISCELLANEOUS TRIGGERFISH LEATHER JACKS UNICORNFISH AND A HUNDRED OTHERS THAT LEFT STRIPES ON THIS LUMINOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THEIR COURSE
THEIR HUNTING WAS NOT A FASCINATING SPORT
THE ELECTRICIANS ON BOARD DECIDED TO CUT THE CABLE BEFORE FISHING IT UP AND BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT EVENING THEY HAD RETRIEVED THE DAMAGED PART
HIS SHIFT OVER EACH MAN SURRENDERED TO A GASPING COMPANION THE AIR TANK THAT WOULD REVIVE HIM
BUT AS SOON AS HIS HANDS SEIZED THE RAILING HE WAS THROWN BACKWARD IN HIS TURN
WITH ITS UNTOLD DEPTHS COULDN'T THE SEA KEEP ALIVE SUCH HUGE SPECIMENS OF LIFE FROM ANOTHER AGE THIS SEA THAT NEVER CHANGES WHILE THE LAND MASSES UNDERGO ALMOST CONTINUOUS ALTERATION
SO I BEGAN A CAREFUL REEXAMINATION OF OUR CELL
THANKS TO THE WORK OF POLYPS A SLOW BUT STEADY UPHEAVAL WILL SOMEDAY CONNECT THESE ISLANDS TO EACH OTHER
I THINK I'VE NOW EARNED THE RIGHT TO DUB IT THAT
OBSERVING THE SITUATION FOR SOME WHILE THE CAPTAIN SAID TO ME
THE BAROMETER WHICH MEASURES THE HEAVINESS OF THE OUTSIDE AIR AND FORECASTS CHANGES IN THE WEATHER
WE CAN'T STAY ANY LONGER IN THIS BOILING WATER I TOLD THE CAPTAIN
AND YET THEY CAN'T ESCAPE THE PROVENçAL FISHERMEN WHO PRIZE THEM AS HIGHLY AS DID THE ANCIENT INHABITANTS OF TURKEY AND ITALY
NOW THEN THE SEA IS PRECISELY THEIR BEST MEDIUM THE ONLY SETTING SUITABLE FOR THE BREEDING AND GROWING OF SUCH GIANTS--NEXT TO WHICH SUCH LAND ANIMALS AS ELEPHANTS OR RHINOCEROSES ARE MERE DWARVES
IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS MY BOY THEN WE HAVE AMPLE TIME TO FINISH OUR VOYAGE CONSEIL REPLIED IF NED LAND DOESN'T MESS THINGS UP THUS REASSURED CONSEIL WENT BACK TO STUDYING THE SHALLOWS THAT THE NAUTILUS WAS SKIMMING AT MODERATE SPEED
IT WAS FLOATING NEXT TO AN EMBANKMENT SHAPED LIKE A WHARF
I MIGHT ADD IN FACT THAT THE AIR BLADDERS OF FISH CONTAIN MORE NITROGEN THAN OXYGEN WHEN THESE ANIMALS ARE CAUGHT AT THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND CONVERSELY MORE OXYGEN THAN NITROGEN WHEN THEY'RE PULLED UP FROM THE LOWER DEPTHS
THE FRUITS OF YOUR RESEARCH MUST NOT BE LOST
WHEN THESE MAMMALS WANTED TO RELOCATE THEY MOVED IN LITTLE JUMPS MADE BY CONTRACTING THEIR BODIES CLUMSILY HELPED BY THEIR IMPERFECTLY DEVELOPED FLIPPERS WHICH AS WITH THEIR MANATEE RELATIVES FORM ACTUAL FOREARMS
HAVEN'T I ENCOMPASSED IT MYSELF
IT WAS MADE OF BLACK GLASSY LAVA MIXED WITH BITS OF FELDSPAR
THE DOOR OPENED
YOU MEAN BEAT US TO A FARE-THEE-WELL LET'S NOT EXAGGERATE MR LAND I WENT ON
THE THERMOMETER MARKED 2 DEGREES CENTIGRADE
THEY TRIED TO ENFORCE THEIR RULE AS FAR AS GREECE BUT THEY HAD TO RETREAT BEFORE THE INDOMITABLE RESISTANCE OF THE HELLENIC PEOPLE
THE SEAFLOOR ROSE NOTICEABLY AND WHEN I LIFTED MY ARMS SOMETIMES THEY WOULD PASS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
YOU SEE ONLY IMPEDIMENTS AND OBSTACLES
EVERYTHING SEEMED DEAD INSIDE THIS BOAT
BUT THIS SIGHT COULD COST US DEARLY
THIS GULFWEED THE SWIMMING GULFWEED OR BERRY CARRIER IS THE CHIEF SUBSTANCE MAKING UP THIS IMMENSE SHOAL
SINCE I COULD NO LONGER HOLD MY TONGUE I LET IT WAG
IT WAS AN ALBATROSS OF THE FINEST SPECIES A WONDERFUL SPECIMEN OF THESE OPEN-SEA FOWL
WE KEPT RISING ON A DIAGONAL GOING ALONG THIS SHINY SURFACE THAT SPARKLED BENEATH OUR ELECTRIC RAYS
I ASK ONLY A LITTLE PATIENCE OF YOU SINCE YOU'LL HAVE AMPLE TIME TO BE PATIENT
THESE TWO DIMENSIONS ALLOW YOU TO OBTAIN VIA A SIMPLE CALCULATION THE SURFACE AREA AND VOLUME OF THE NAUTILUS
EACH BOAT IS MANNED BY TEN OARSMEN AND TEN FISHERMEN
THE NAUTILUS IS HEADING THAT DIRECTION AND WE'LL SOON KNOW WHAT WE'RE IN FOR IN FACT THAT BLACKISH OBJECT WAS SOON ONLY A MILE AWAY FROM US
IN ANOTHER TWO TUNA AND A SAILOR IN UNIFORM
AND IF THE STRANGE COMMANDER OF THIS BOAT DID HAVE A SECRET TO KEEP WHICH SEEMED RATHER LIKELY--HE WOULD NEVER GIVE US FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT ABOARD HIS VESSEL
OH
AFTER ITS FISHING WAS FINISHED AND ITS AIR SUPPLY RENEWED I THOUGHT THE NAUTILUS WOULD RESUME ITS UNDERWATER EXCURSION AND I WAS GETTING READY TO RETURN TO MY STATEROOM WHEN CAPTAIN NEMO TURNED TO ME AND SAID WITHOUT FURTHER PREAMBLE
IT WAS SHEER BAD LUCK
GOOD HE SAID
PROFESSOR ARONNAX ABOARD THE NAUTILUS NOVEMBER 16 1867 CAPTAIN NEMO INVITES PROFESSOR ARONNAX ON A HUNTING TRIP THAT WILL TAKE PLACE TOMORROW MORNING IN HIS CRESPO ISLAND FORESTS
ON JULY 20 WE CUT THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN AT LONGITUDE 105 DEGREES AND BY THE 27TH OF THE SAME MONTH WE HAD CLEARED THE EQUATOR ON THE 110TH MERIDIAN
I COULDN'T HELP SHOWING MY DISTASTE FOR SUCH A BEVERAGE
PART OF THE NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT INCIDENT
THANK YOU MR LAND HE TOLD HIM
BUT I DON'T THINK THESE FISHERIES BRING IN THE RETURNS THEY ONCE DID
WHERE ARE WE I ASKED
CRUEL AND MERCILESS
OH IF ONLY I DIDN'T HAVE TO BREATHE TO LEAVE MORE AIR FOR MASTER IT BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES TO HEAR HIM SAY THESE WORDS
THROUGH BRUTE FORCE ALONE THE SUBMERSIBLE CARVED OUT A CHANNEL FOR ITSELF
THAT NIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INDIAN OCEAN WHEN HE IMPRISONED US IN THE CELL HADN'T HE ATTACKED SOME SHIP
THERE ANIMAL LIFE WAS REPRESENTED BY NOTHING MORE THAN SEA LILIES STARFISH DELIGHTFUL CRINOIDS WITH BELL-SHAPED HEADS LIKE LITTLE CHALICES ON STRAIGHT STEMS TOP-SHELL SNAILS BLOOD-RED TOOTH SHELLS AND FISSURELLA SNAILS A LARGE SPECIES OF COASTAL MOLLUSK
I DECLAIMED INSIDE THIS COPPER BOX THAT TOPPED MY HEAD SPENDING MORE AIR ON EMPTY WORDS THAN WAS PERHAPS ADVISABLE
AS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED VERNE'S CAPTAIN NEMO WAS A POLISH NOBLEMAN WHOSE ENTIRE FAMILY HAD BEEN SLAUGHTERED BY RUSSIAN TROOPS
HOW CAN YOU LIGHT YOUR WAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN WITH THE RUHMKORFF DEVICE PROFESSOR ARONNAX
WHEN
WHY AM I CHAINED TO THIS HUNK OF SHEET IRON WHY NED I REPLIED
WELL NED YOU WANT ME TO ASK CAPTAIN NEMO WHAT HE INTENDS TO DO WITH US YES SIR EVEN THOUGH HE HAS ALREADY MADE THAT CLEAR YES
THE SEAS SOME FIGURES 96 SOME FIGURES 95 102 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS SOME FIGURES 101 SOME FIGURES 103 112 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS THE BLACK CURRENT 111 THE BLACK CURRENT 114 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS AN INVITATION IN WRITING 113 STROLLING THE PLAINS 121 122 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS STROLLING THE PLAINS 123 124 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS STROLLING THE PLAINS 124 STROLLING THE PLAINS 125 126 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS 130 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS AN UNDERWATER FOREST 129 94 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS 94 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS 131 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS 140 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS FOUR THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE PACIFIC 139 148 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS VANIKORO 147 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS THE TORRES STRAIT THE TORRES STRAIT
ON MAY 8 WHILE ABREAST OF NORTH CAROLINA WE WERE ACROSS FROM CAPE HATTERAS ONCE MORE
OUT OF HABIT I WAITED FOR HIM TO PRONOUNCE HIS DAILY PHRASE
THEN ADDRESSING ME DIRECTLY AS IF TO DRIVE AWAY AN UGLY THOUGHT
AND IN ONLY A FEW YEARS HOW MANY VICTIMS HAVE BEEN FURNISHED TO THE OBITUARY NOTICES BY THE ROYAL MAIL INMAN AND MONTREAL LINES
SO WHERE WAS IT BOUND
NOW THEN ALTHOUGH THE LATTER HYPOTHESIS WAS COMPLETELY ADMISSIBLE IT COULDN'T STAND UP TO INQUIRIES CONDUCTED IN BOTH THE NEW WORLD AND THE OLD
ONLY CONTRARY TO PLANTS ON SHORE THESE TREE FORMS BECOME ATTACHED TO ROCKS ON THE SEAFLOOR BY HEADING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
EQUIPPED WITH PICKS SOME TEN MEN CLIMBED ONTO THE NAUTILUS'S SIDES AND CRACKED LOOSE THE ICE AROUND THE SHIP'S LOWER PLATING WHICH WAS SOON SET FREE
WERE THEY FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS FELLOW MAN
TWO AND A HALF METERS BELOW ITS WATERLINE THERE GAPED A SYMMETRICAL GASH IN THE SHAPE OF AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE
THAT DAY THEY GATHERED UP SOME UNUSUAL SPECIMENS FROM THESE FISH-FILLED WATERWAYS
THREAD HERRING FIFTEEN INCHES LONG WERE WRAPPED IN THEIR PHOSPHORESCENT GLIMMERS
BUT CONSEIL HAD ONE FLAW
IT DIDN'T FOLLOW THE EXACT COURSE OF THE ZEALOUS AND THE NEW ASTROLABE WHICH HAD PROVED SO ILL-FATED FOR CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE
I EVEN RECOMMEND THAT THEY BE ACCLIMATIZED TO FRESH WATER A CHANGE INCIDENTALLY THAT A NUMBER OF SALTWATER FISH CAN MAKE WITH EASE
I KNOW THAT IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS NEGROES DON'T HESITATE TO ATTACK SHARKS DAGGER IN ONE HAND AND NOOSE IN THE OTHER
THROUGH THE WINDOWS YOU COULD SEE THEIR ENORMOUS MOUTHS PAVED WITH TEETH THEIR FEARSOME EYES
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THIS SEMIDARKNESS AMID THIS LIQUID THAT'S SO DENSE IN COMPARISON TO THE ATMOSPHERE A GUNSHOT COULDN'T CARRY FAR AND WOULD PROVE FATAL ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY ON THE CONTRARY SIR WITH THIS RIFLE EVERY SHOT IS FATAL
LIKE YOU I'M A MAN NEGLECTED AND UNKNOWN LIVING IN THE FAINT HOPE THAT SOMEDAY I CAN PASS ON TO FUTURE GENERATIONS THE FRUITS OF MY LABORS--FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING BY MEANS OF SOME CONTRIVANCE LEFT TO THE LUCK OF WINDS AND WAVES
BY THIS POINT THE NAUTILUS WAS RESTING ON A BED OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK AND DRILLED BY BORES IN A THOUSAND PLACES
I WANTED TO ASK THE CAPTAIN BUT I STILL DIDN'T GRASP THAT SIGN LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWED HIM TO CHAT WITH HIS COMPANIONS WHEN THEY WENT WITH HIM ON HIS UNDERWATER EXCURSIONS
THAT'S ALL AS I SPOKE I TRIED TO SOUND MORE CONFIDENT THAN I REALLY FELT
AFTER TEN MINUTES OF WALKING WE WERE IN FIVE METERS OF WATER AND THE TERRAIN HAD BECOME ALMOST FLAT
WOULD MASTER KINDLY COME HERE FOR AN INSTANT HE SAID TO ME IN AN ODD VOICE
I PLACED IT IN CONSEIL'S HANDS AND HOLDING IT LIKE PRECIOUS PORCELAIN FROM CHINA THAT CAUTIOUS SURE-FOOTED LAD GOT IT BACK TO THE NAUTILUS IN ONE PIECE
POSSIBLY THE CANADIAN WAS FAMILIAR WITH THIS DISTINCTION BUT CONSEIL KNEW FAR MORE ABOUT IT
MYRIAMETER ROUGHLY 6.2 MILES TON METRIC ROUGHLY 2,200 POUNDS VIII FIRST PART CHAPTER 1 A RUNAWAY REEF THE YEAR 1866 WAS MARKED BY A BIZARRE DEVELOPMENT AN UNEXPLAINED AND DOWNRIGHT INEXPLICABLE PHENOMENON THAT SURELY NO ONE HAS FORGOTTEN
THE SKIFF WAS AGROUND TEN FATHOMS AWAY FROM US
A WELL-KNOWN HISSING TOLD ME THAT WATER WAS ENTERING THE SHIP'S BALLAST TANKS
THE THREE OF US RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE
WOULD HE DOUBLE THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE THEN CAPE HORN AND PUSH ON TO THE ANTARCTIC POLE
I LIKED HIM BETTER ECCENTRIC THAN INSANE THESE THOUGHTS WERE CLEARLY READABLE ON MY FACE
PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO THEN TOLD ME THERE ARE PEARL FISHERIES IN THE BAY OF BENGAL THE SEAS OF THE EAST INDIES THE SEAS OF CHINA AND JAPAN PLUS THOSE SEAS SOUTH OF THE UNITED STATES THE GULF OF PANAMA AND THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA
IN 1600 SIR THE DUTCHMAN GHERITK WAS SWEPT BY STORMS AND CURRENTS REACHING LATITUDE 64 DEGREES SOUTH AND DISCOVERING THE SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS
CAPTAIN NEMO HAD JUST ACTIVATED HIS ELECTRIC DEVICE
CONSEIL A CREATURE OF HABIT CAME TO ASK HOW MASTER'S NIGHT WENT AND TO OFFER HIS SERVICES
SEVEN ARMS OUT OF EIGHT HAD BEEN CHOPPED OFF
MY MOUTH WAS FILLING WITH WATER
AFTER DISCOVERING YOUR IDENTITIES I WANTED TO WEIGH CAREFULLY WHAT POLICY TO PURSUE TOWARD YOU
AH MY GALLANT NED
IT'S EASY TO FIND OUT I ANSWERED
HOISTED ON BOARD THE LONGBOAT WAS READJUSTED INTO ITS SOCKET AND THE NAUTILUS PLUNGED BACK BENEATH THE WAVES
28 282 21
THIS DIVER DIDN'T SEE US
JUST THEN I SAW THE CAPTAIN'S WEAPON SPRING TO HIS SHOULDER AND TRACK A MOVING OBJECT THROUGH THE BUSHES
CROSSING THROUGH THE LOUNGE I ARRIVED AT THE DOOR CONTRIVED IN ONE OF THE CANTED CORNERS THAT OPENED INTO THE CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM
I LAY OUTSTRETCHED STRENGTH GONE NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS
BUT THE NAUTILUS KEPT GRAVITATING SOUTHWARD
THEN SOME SEA POACHERS FISH BELONGING TO THE GENUS ASPIDOPHOROIDES WHOSE BODIES ARE COVERED WITH SCALY ARMOR DIVIDED INTO EIGHT LENGTHWISE SECTIONS
IF THE LOWER HALF OF THE SUN'S DISK DISAPPEARED JUST AS THE CHRONOMETER SAID NOON WE WERE RIGHT AT THE POLE
NOT A REEF NOT AN ISLET
I KNOW THAT SOME DIVERS CAN LAST UP TO FIFTY-SEVEN SECONDS AND HIGHLY SKILLFUL ONES TO EIGHTY-SEVEN
I WAS RIGHT TO CLAIM THAT BALEEN WHALES HAVE ENOUGH NATURAL ENEMIES WITHOUT COUNTING MAN
I HEARD PUMPS OPERATING WITHIN THE SHIP I FELT THE WATER LOWERING AROUND ME AND IN A FEW MOMENTS THE CELL WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY
UNDER ITS GAZE THE SEA CAUGHT ON FIRE LIKE A TRAIL OF GUNPOWDER
THE NAUTILUS HAD DRIFTED INTO THE MIDST OF SOME PHOSPHORESCENT STRATA WHICH IN THIS DARKNESS CAME OFF AS POSITIVELY DAZZLING
WE WERE TURNING OUR BACKS ON EUROPE
NO SIR HE REPLIED
THE LATTER METHOD CALLS FOR THE SERVICES OF A DIVER BUT IT'S PREFERABLE BECAUSE IT SPARES THE POLYPARY'S TISSUE LEAVING IT WITH A MUCH HIGHER MARKET VALUE
SO LET'S TRY IT PROFESSOR BY THEN THE THERMOMETER GAVE 7 DEGREES CENTIGRADE OUTSIDE
FROM THESE SEAS I'LL ALSO MENTION SOME UNUSUAL SPECIMENS OF CROAKERS FISH FROM THE ORDER ACANTHOPTERYGIA FAMILY SCIENIDEA
I'M GOING TO GROUND THE NAUTILUS ON THE LOWER SHELF THEN MY MEN WILL PUT ON THEIR DIVING SUITS AND ATTACK THE THINNEST OF THESE ICE WALLS CAN THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE BE LEFT OPEN WITHOUT ILL EFFECT
IT TOLD ME THAT THE NAUTILUS WAS AFLOAT ON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
THE ROADS AREN'T TERRIBLY WELL KEPT UP EVERYTHING YOU SAY CAPTAIN JUST INCREASES MY CURIOSITY
INITIALLY I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT THAT THESE FRAGILE PARTITIONS COULD BREAK
I STARED AT NED LAND WHOSE MOTIVES WERE EASY TO GUESS
AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING JANUARY 8 I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
THEY'VE COME IN THEIR DUGOUTS YES SIR WELL SIR CLOSING THE HATCHES SHOULD DO THE TRICK PRECISELY AND THAT'S WHAT I CAME TO TELL YOU NOTHING EASIER CAPTAIN NEMO SAID
ALSO CAUGHT WERE A COUPLE DOZEN NILE DUCK SUPERIOR-TASTING WILDFOWL WHOSE NECK AND CROWN OF THE HEAD ARE WHITE SPECKLED WITH BLACK
BUT LET'S CONTINUE OUR OBSERVATIONS MY EYES FLEW BACK TO THE PRESSURE GAUGE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR THE VIEWS OF ONE CHRONICLER IN THE 14TH CENTURY GLADLY THIS FANCIFUL FELLOW CLAIMS THE SEA WAS GIVEN ITS NAME AFTER THE CROSSING OF THE ISRAELITES WHEN THE PHARAOH PERISHED IN THOSE WAVES THAT CAME TOGETHER AGAIN AT MOSES COMMAND
LOOK AT THE CONSTRUCTION WORK GOING ON UNDER THESE WAVES I RETURNED TO THE WINDOW
MONSTROUS WAVES RACE TOGETHER FROM EVERY POINT OF THE HORIZON
AND WHY NOT WHAT GOOD WOULD A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS DO US HERE ON THE NAUTILUS HERE NO NED LAND SAID
WHAT OTHER BOLDER PIONEER WOULD COME AX IN HAND TO CLEAR AWAY ITS DARK UNDERBRUSH
YOU KNOW HIM CAPTAIN WHY NOT PROFESSOR ARONNAX THIS SAID CAPTAIN NEMO WENT TO A CABINET STANDING NEAR THE LOUNGE'S LEFT PANEL
SOME BROOK LAMPREY A TYPE OF EEL FIFTEEN INCHES LONG HEAD GREENISH FINS VIOLET BACK BLUISH GRAY BELLY A SILVERY BROWN STREWN WITH BRIGHT SPOTS IRIS OF THE EYE ENCIRCLED IN GOLD UNUSUAL ANIMALS THAT THE AMAZON'S CURRENT MUST HAVE SWEPT OUT TO SEA BECAUSE THEIR NATURAL HABITAT IS FRESH WATER
I PROMISE YOU NOT ONLY WILL THE NAUTILUS FLOAT CLEAR IT WILL GO FARTHER STILL FARTHER SOUTH I ASKED GAPING AT THE CAPTAIN
THERE HAD BEEN A COLLISION BUT IT WAS COMPARATIVELY MILD
SIDE BY SIDE CAPTAIN NEMO AND I WALKED DIRECTLY TOWARD THIS CONSPICUOUS FLAME
NO LUXURIES
I ASKED THE CAPTAIN WHAT THIS LADDER WAS FOR
AT WHICH POINT I ESTIMATE THAT IT HELD MORE THAN 1,000 KILOGRAMS OF GOLD IN OTHER WORDS CLOSE TO 5,000,000 FRANCS
BUT MY EYES SOON GREW ACCUSTOMED TO ITS DARKNESS AND I SAW THE PILOT A MUSCULAR MAN WHOSE HANDS RESTED ON THE PEGS OF THE WHEEL
IF YOU DON'T MIND PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME WE'LL DETERMINE OUR EXACT POSITION AND FIX THE STARTING POINT OF OUR VOYAGE
IF YOU WANT TO CONSIGN PEOPLE TO OBLIVION YOU DON'T LIGHT UP THEIR DUNGEONS
OUR PROGRESS WAS SWIFT
ITS CHIEF ARM MAKES FOR THE SHORES OF IRELAND AND NORWAY WHILE THE SECOND FLEXES SOUTHWARD AT THE LEVEL OF THE AZORES
THE NAVAL ARSENALS WERE UNLOCKED FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT WHO PRESSED ENERGETICALLY FORWARD WITH THE ARMING OF HIS FRIGATE
THEIR TENACITY WAS SO GREAT THEY WOULD RIP APART RATHER THAN LET GO
NO STORMS TO BRAVE BECAUSE JUST A FEW METERS BENEATH THE WAVES IT FINDS ABSOLUTE TRANQUILITY
NO ONE IS UNAWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THAT GREAT WARM-WATER CURRENT KNOWN BY NAME AS THE GULF STREAM
THEIR TAILS CHURNED THE NORMALLY PEACEFUL STRATA INTO ACTUAL BILLOWS
AYE SIR THE ENGINEER REPLIED
AYE SIR THE ENGINEER REPLIED
HE WANTED TO RISE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES AND HARPOON THE MONSTERS ESPECIALLY CERTAIN SMOOTH-HOUND SHARKS WHOSE MOUTHS WERE PAVED WITH TEETH ARRANGED LIKE A MOSAIC AND SOME BIG FIVE-METER TIGER SHARKS THAT INSISTED ON PERSONALLY PROVOKING HIM
FORTUNATELY NED'S HANDS CAME ACROSS A BIG MOORING RING FASTENED TO THE TOPSIDE OF THIS SHEET-IRON BACK AND WE ALL HELD ON FOR DEAR LIFE
CAPTAIN NEMO APPEARED
HE APPROACHED THE THERMOMETER CONSULTED IT AND TURNED TO ME
TRAILING IN THIS WAY FROM THESE IRON GLOVE MAKERS THE RESULTING RECEPTACLES SCOURED THE OCEAN FLOOR AND COLLECTED EVERY MARINE EXHIBIT IN THEIR PATH
WHEN WE RETURN TO SHORE JADED FROM ALL THESE NATURAL WONDERS CONSEIL ADDED THINK HOW WE'LL LOOK DOWN ON THOSE PITIFUL LAND MASSES THOSE PUNY WORKS OF MAN
BUT WE WERE MOVING AT A MODERATE SPEED
OFTEN NO LONGER SEEING ANY WAY OUT I THOUGHT WE WERE IMPRISONED FOR GOOD BUT CAPTAIN NEMO GUIDED BY HIS INSTINCTS DISCOVERED NEW PASSAGEWAYS FROM THE TINIEST INDICATIONS
CONSEIL AND I WERE SOON DRESSED IN THESE DIVING SUITS AS WERE CAPTAIN NEMO AND ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS--A HERCULEAN TYPE WHO MUST HAVE BEEN PRODIGIOUSLY STRONG
I REALIZED MOREOVER THAT NED LAND'S BROODING WAS GETTING HIM MADDER BY THE MINUTE
THAT ESSENCE OF ORIENT MUST SELL FOR QUITE A LARGE SUM AS LITTLE AS ZERO
SHRUBS AND EVEN A FEW TREES EMERGED FROM CREVICES IN THE WALLS
AMONG OTHER SPECIMENS FROM THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP SOME PEACOCK-TAILED FLABELLARIAN CORAL POLYPS FLATTENED INTO STYLISH SHAPES AND UNIQUE TO THIS PART OF THE OCEAN
WHAT EVERYBODY KNOWS CAPTAIN I ANSWERED HIM
BUT IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE TO ME THAT IT HAD DISCOVERED THE NAUTILUS AT SUCH A DISTANCE STILL LESS THAT IT KNEW WHAT THIS UNDERWATER MACHINE REALLY WAS
AS FOR THE RUHMKORFF DEVICE IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE IN THE PICTURE
AND IN TRUTH WE USED UP A GOOD PART OF OUR AMMUNITION IN VAIN
AN IRON BEDSTEAD A WORKTABLE SOME WASHSTAND FIXTURES
2 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS 8 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS A RUNAWAY REEF 9 A RUNAWAY REEF 11 16 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS THE PROS AND CONS 17 18 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS AS MASTER WISHES 19 22 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS AS MASTER WISHES 23 28 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS NED LAND 27 30 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS AT RANDOM
I DIDN'T SEE A SOUL FROM THE CREW
I COULDN'T STAND THIS BRIGHTNESS BUT CAPTAIN NEMO STARED STRAIGHT AT IT AS IF TO INHALE THE SPIRIT OF THE STORM
I COULD HARDLY WAIT UNTIL OUR POSITION WAS REPORTED ON THE CHART
THEY ALL ROSE RIGHT UP TOWARD THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
NOBODY COULD BE BETTER THAN A KIND AND GENEROUS MAN LIKE YOURSELF ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THE CANADIAN REPEATED IN EMBARRASSMENT
SO CIRCUMSTANCES WERE IN FAVOR OF THE CANADIAN'S PLANS
THEN ADDRESSING ME
HIS EYES WERE GLEAMING WITH DESIRE AT THE SIGHT OF THAT ANIMAL
THE ROCK WAS A DEVILFISH AND THAT'S EVERYTHING WE KNOW THE CANADIAN ASKED
THE FEELING BECAME SO ACUTE I WONDERED WHETHER IT WOULDN'T BE BETTER TO ENTER THE CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM DARE HIM FACE TO FACE BRAVE IT OUT WITH WORD AND DEED
MEANWHILE TO AVOID RUNNING AGROUND THE NAUTILUS HALTED THREE CABLE LENGTHS FROM A STRAND CROWNED BY SUPERB PILES OF ROCKS
WE KNOW THAT THE CREW OF THE ROYAL NAVY'S BULLDOG FISHED UP A STARFISH FROM 2,620 FATHOMS HENCE FROM A DEPTH OF MORE THAN ONE VERTICAL LEAGUE
IN SHORT I CAN ADMIRE YOU AND COMFORTABLY GO WITH YOU WHILE PLAYING A ROLE I ONLY PARTLY UNDERSTAND
I OBSERVED THAT THE RED SEA'S WATER WAS BECOMING LESS SALTY THE CLOSER WE GOT TO SUEZ
THANKS TO THEM I'VE WITNESSED THE DESTRUCTION OF EVERYTHING I LOVED CHERISHED AND VENERATED--HOMELAND WIFE CHILDREN FATHER AND MOTHER
I DIDN'T WANT TO FALL BEHIND
WHERE HAD THIS PRECIOUS METAL COME FROM
NO VEHEMENT PHRASES WILL LEAVE MY MOUTH NO VICIOUS GESTURES WILL GIVE MY FEELINGS AWAY NOT EVEN WHEN THEY DON'T FEED US ON TIME I HAVE YOUR WORD NED I ANSWERED THE CANADIAN
IT WAS UNABLE TO FLY
BUT IT WAS ONLY A FLEETING VISION AND THE NAUTILUS SOON SANK BENEATH THE DARK WAVES OF THESE WATERWAYS
THEN CONTRARY TO CUSTOM HE ORDERED THAT BOTH PANELS IN THE LOUNGE BE OPENED AND GOING FROM THE ONE TO THE OTHER HE CAREFULLY OBSERVED THE WATERY MASS
HOWEVER NED LAND STILL FOUND THESE PROVISIONS INADEQUATE
ACCORDINGLY NOT WANTING TO ENTANGLE HIS PROPELLER IN THIS WEED-CHOKED MASS CAPTAIN NEMO STAYED AT A DEPTH SOME METERS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
SO HE MADE ME A PROPOSITION I HADN'T ANTICIPATED
MY LIMBS STIFFENED IN THE GRIP OF INTENSE CRAMPS
BUT THIS SEA PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE TOLD ME THIS PRODIGIOUS INEXHAUSTIBLE WET NURSE OF A SEA NOT ONLY FEEDS ME SHE DRESSES ME AS WELL
A DOOR OPENED AND I STOOD IN THE COMPARTMENT WHERE CAPTAIN NEMO INDISPUTABLY A WORLD-CLASS ENGINEER HAD SET UP HIS LOCOMOTIVE EQUIPMENT
FOR MY PART I NOTED ONLY SOME LOGGERHEAD TURTLES WITH LONG CARAPACES
SOON I FELT THE BEATS OF OUR PROPELLER GETTING FASTER AND WE PICKED UP SPEED
IN ESSENCE THIS INGENIOUS AMERICAN HAS NOTED THAT BETWEEN THE SOUTH POLE AND THE 60TH PARALLEL THE SEA IS COVERED WITH FLOATING ICE OF DIMENSIONS MUCH GREATER THAN ANY FOUND IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC
IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO ACCEPT THAT PRODIGIOUS THINGS CAN COME FROM OUR CREATOR
THE PROPELLER WAS GOING SO FAST I COULD NEITHER FOLLOW NOR COUNT ITS REVOLUTIONS
MORE THAN ONCE THEIR COMPOSITION PROVOKED COMMENTS FROM CONSEIL
AS HAPPENS IN THE POLAR REGIONS IT SEEMED THAT NIGHT AND DAY NO LONGER FOLLOWED THEIR NORMAL SEQUENCE
AT 10:15 CAPTAIN NEMO HIMSELF TOOK THE HELM
I ASSUME THIS CONDITION IS ONE AN HONEST MAN CAN ACCEPT YES SIR
JUST THEN A HUGE CAVE OPENED UP IN OUR PATH HOLLOWED FROM A PICTURESQUE PILE OF ROCKS WHOSE SMOOTH HEIGHTS WERE COMPLETELY HUNG WITH UNDERWATER FLORA
BY TOMORROW WHO KNOWS IF THIS SHIP WON'T BE 100 LEAGUES OUT TO SEA
DREADFUL INDEED IF AS WE COULD ASSUME CAPTAIN NEMO HAD BEEN USING THE NAUTILUS IN WORKS OF VENGEANCE
IT CARRIED SEVENTY-FOUR CANNONS AND WAS LAUNCHED IN 1762
WHAT CAUSED THAT EXPLOSION I ASKED
THE MOLLUSK'S TWO VALVES WERE PARTLY OPEN
28 I'VE COLLECTED EVERY ONE OF THEM 56 WE WALKED WITH STEADY STEPS
GOOD LORD THE CANADIAN WENT ON IT'S ROLLED OVER ON ITS BACK AND IT'S RAISING ITS BREASTS IN THE AIR IT'S A SIREN CONSEIL EXCLAIMED
WE'LL FILL THEM UP AND THEY'LL SUPPLY ALL THE OXYGEN WE NEED GOOD THINKING PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CAPTAIN REPLIED WITH A SMILE
SO THOSE MILLIONS HAD BEEN DELIVERED TO THEIR ADDRESS
EVEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HAVE NOTICED ME SO COMPLETELY WAS HE IMMERSED IN HIS TRANCE
THE ELECTRIC LOG INDICATED THAT THE NAUTILUS HAD REDUCED SPEED
KINDLY BE SEATED HE TOLD ME
IT WAS NED LAND'S VOICE AND IT SHOUTED
SEVERAL TIMES I SAW CAPTAIN NEMO STOP AND TAKE AIM WITH HIS RIFLE
ACCORDINGLY I'LL REST CONTENT WITH DRAWING ON MY RESERVE STOCK OF SODIUM
NEAR FIVE O'CLOCK A TORRENTIAL RAIN FELL BUT IT LULLED NEITHER WIND NOR SEA
I WOULD ONLY ASK YOU ABOUT THE USES INTENDED FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS OF PHYSICAL MEASURE PROFESSOR THESE SAME INSTRUMENTS ARE FOUND IN MY STATEROOM WHERE I'LL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF EXPLAINING THEIR FUNCTIONS TO YOU
FOUR MEN APPEARED AND NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY PUSHED THE CHEST OUT OF THE LOUNGE
PROPERLY SPEAKING THE SARGASSO SEA COVERS EVERY SUBMERGED PART OF ATLANTIS
AND HOW NED I ASKED DO YOU KNOW THAT'S SO BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY SO AND WHY DO PEOPLE SAY SO BECAUSE PEOPLE KNOW SO NO NED
ABOVE US THE YAWNING CRATER LOOKED LIKE THE WIDE MOUTH OF A WELL
MORE TRANQUIL AND LESS FEARFUL THAN THEIR NORTHERN RELATIVES THEY POSTED NO SENTINELS ON GUARD DUTY AT THE APPROACHES TO THEIR CAMPSITE
THE STURGEON AH CONSEIL MY FRIEND YOU SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST IN MY OPINION ANYHOW
LEANING AGAINST THE WALLS I DRAGGED MYSELF DOWN THE GANGWAYS TO THE LOUNGE WHOSE CEILING LIGHTS WERE ON
CONSEIL EH
IT HAD A PICTURE THAT PORTRAYED THE DEVILFISH IN QUESTION OH GOOD NED LAND EXCLAIMED WITH A BURST OF LAUGHTER
MY COMPANIONS AND I TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN STRETCHING OUT ON ITS FINE-GRAINED SAND
WE OUGHT TO BE BACK BEFORE NIGHTFALL I SAID
ONCE IMMERSED IN WATER ALL THESE OBJECTS LOST A PART OF THEIR WEIGHT EQUAL TO THE WEIGHT OF THE LIQUID THEY DISPLACED AND THANKS TO THIS LAW OF PHYSICS DISCOVERED BY ARCHIMEDES I DID JUST FINE
BESIDES THERE WERE TWO OF US
AT TEN O'CLOCK THE MOON WON'T BE UP YET
I CAN SEE WE'RE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME WITH A HALF SMILE
SO HE WENT UP AND DOWN SEVERAL TIMES
SEVERAL VALUABLE SPECIES OF CYTHERA CLAMS AND VENUS CLAMS
CONSEQUENTLY THE FEATS OF KRAKENS OR OTHER MONSTERS OF THAT ILK MUST BE RELEGATED TO THE REALM OF FICTION SO MR NATURALIST NED LAND CONTINUED IN A BANTERING TONE YOU'LL JUST KEEP ON BELIEVING IN THE EXISTENCE OF SOME ENORMOUS CETACEAN YES NED I REPEAT IT WITH A CONVICTION BACKED BY FACTUAL LOGIC
AND BESIDES WE AREN'T ON IT BUT UNDER IT A SANDY BEACH UNFOLDED BEFORE US MEASURING 500 FEET AT ITS WIDEST POINT BETWEEN THE WATERS OF THE LAKE AND THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN'S WALLS
ITS COASTLINE LOOKED FLAT BUT HIGH MOUNTAINS ROSE IN THE DISTANCE
THIS WAS THE MONSTER'S DEATH RATTLE
THEN DUMONT D'URVILLE TRIED TO DEPART
IT HIT THE ANIMAL BUT NOT IN THE USUAL FASHION--IT BOUNCED OFF THAT ROUNDED SURFACE AND VANISHED INTO THE SEA TWO MILES OUT
IT'S EXCELLENT I SAID BUT IT'S NOT FROM THE TOBACCO PLANT RIGHT THE CAPTAIN REPLIED THIS TOBACCO COMES FROM NEITHER HAVANA NOR THE ORIENT
STILL MASTER SHOULD TELL OUR STORY CONSEIL SAID TO ME
SO PROFESSOR I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW BRIGHT AND EARLY THIS SAID IN A CAREFREE TONE CAPTAIN NEMO LEFT THE LOUNGE
AND DEPRIVED OF THIS ADORNMENT IT DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE WATERS FINALLY AN ACTUAL EVENT NED LAND SAID
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED NEAR TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND FRESH ICE KEPT FORMING OVER THE SHIP'S SIDES WITH ASTONISHING SPEED
DRIFT ICE OR FLOATING FLOES
THE MAN HAD KEPT HIS ENERGY AND COMPOSURE
FROM EIGHT TO NINE O'CLOCK THE NAUTILUS STAYED A FEW METERS BENEATH THE WATERS
EVEN SO THESE MEN WERE FRUGAL OF SPEECH AND USED AMONG THEMSELVES ONLY THAT BIZARRE DIALECT WHOSE ORIGIN I COULDN'T EVEN GUESS
THE DARKNESS IN THE LOUNGE ENHANCED THE BRIGHTNESS OUTSIDE AND WE STARED AS IF THIS CLEAR GLASS WERE THE WINDOW OF AN IMMENSE AQUARIUM
BY EVENING WE HAD CLEARED 200 LEAGUES UP THE ATLANTIC
I THINK THE HORN-COVERED MANDIBLES OF ONE OF THESE SQUID ARE ENTANGLED IN THE BLADES
PERHAPS FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLES OF OYSTER FARMERS IN CHINA AND INDIA HE HAD EVEN PREDETERMINED THE CREATION OF THIS PEARL BY STICKING UNDER THE MOLLUSK'S FOLDS SOME PIECE OF GLASS OR METAL THAT WAS GRADUALLY COVERED WITH MOTHER-OF-PEARL
SIMILAR EVENTS WERE LIKEWISE OBSERVED IN PACIFIC SEAS ON JULY 23 OF THE SAME YEAR BY THE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS FROM THE WEST INDIA PACIFIC STEAM NAVIGATION CO
WE'VE GOTTEN OFF WITH A MILD DUNKING
THE HARPOONER'S FAMILY ORIGINATED IN QUEBEC AND THEY WERE ALREADY A LINE OF BOLD FISHERMEN BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN THIS TOWN STILL BELONGED TO FRANCE
A CETACEAN AS POWERFUL AS A WHOLE CAVALRY REGIMENT--NOW THAT'S A WHALE OF A WHALE WE STAYED ON THE ALERT UNTIL DAYLIGHT GETTING READY FOR ACTION
THIS FISHING ENDED OUR STAY IN THE WATERWAYS OF THE AMAZON AND THAT EVENING THE NAUTILUS TOOK TO THE HIGH SEAS ONCE MORE
I ASSUMED THAT HE WAS KEEPING TO THE PILOTHOUSE
IT'S A DAINTY PASTRY
THE PEAR-SHAPED ONES INTO EARRINGS AND SINCE THEY'RE THE MOST VALUABLE THEY'RE PRICED INDIVIDUALLY
WELL CAPTAIN NEMO WENT ON
WELL CAPTAIN NEMO WENT ON
IN THE MIDST OF THIS HOPELESSLY TANGLED FABRIC OF WEEDS AND FUCUS PLANTS I NOTED SOME DELIGHTFUL PINK-COLORED STAR-SHAPED ALCYON CORAL SEA ANEMONE TRAILING THE LONG TRESSES OF THEIR TENTACLES SOME GREEN RED AND BLUE JELLYFISH AND ESPECIALLY THOSE BIG RHIZOSTOME JELLYFISH THAT CUVIER DESCRIBED WHOSE BLUISH PARASOLS ARE TRIMMED WITH VIOLET FESTOONS
THEY'RE SHREWD CETACEANS
A PEARL WORTH TEN MILLION 152 4
A STEWARD ENTERED HE BROUGHT US SOME CLOTHES JACKETS AND SAILOR'S PANTS MADE OUT OF A FABRIC WHOSE NATURE I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
OBVIOUSLY IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE ZOOPHYTE AND MOLLUSK SPECIMENS THE FINE LAD WAS CLASSIFYING HIS HEAD OFF
I SHARED THE RESULTS OF MY OBSERVATIONS WITH THE CANADIAN AND CONSEIL
MEANWHILE THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT AND OUR DISCUSSIONS ARE FUTILE
HE STOOD UP PACING IN CIRCLES LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE STRIKING THE WALLS WITH HIS FOOT AND FIST
AN IDEA VISIBLY CROSSED HIS MIND
FOR NED LAND AS WELL AS FOR EVERY NAVIGATOR BEFORE US I KNEW THAT THIS WAS THE GREAT INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE
DID ITS INVENTOR MEET UP WITH CAPTAIN NEMO
DID ITS INVENTOR MEET UP WITH CAPTAIN NEMO
EVERYTHING THAT BEGINS IN THIS WORLD MUST INEVITABLY COME TO AN END I THINK AS MASTER DOES CONSEIL REPLIED AND IT'S EXTREMELY POSSIBLE THAT AFTER CROSSING EVERY SEA ON THE GLOBE CAPTAIN NEMO WILL BID THE THREE OF US A FOND FAREWELL BID US A FOND FAREWELL THE CANADIAN EXCLAIMED
BUT DIDN'T HE GIVE YOU ANY DETAILS ON NOT A ONE MR NATURALIST
THE HOUR OF BATTLE HAD SOUNDED
ALL TEN MET THE SAME FATE
THOUGH FRAGILE ON IMPACT CRYSTAL CAN STILL OFFER CONSIDERABLE RESISTANCE
IN ANOTHER FINALLY A HORSE WITH ITS RIDER
IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY IN A MANNER OF CONFOUNDED BY THIS LAPSE INTO BANALITY CONSEIL LEFT HIS SENTENCE HANGING
THAT DAY THE USUAL WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH EVEN GREATER ENERGY
ITS CIRCUMFERENCE 900 MILES
HERE'S AN ISLAND
UNCONCERNED THE LATTER LET US COME WITHIN HALF A CABLE LENGTH
AT A MERE GESTURE FROM HIM THE HELMSMAN WOULD INSTANTLY CHANGE THE NAUTILUS'S HEADING
I THEN UNDERSTOOD THE ROLE PLAYED BY THESE WAVES WHICH TRAP AIR IN THEIR FLANKS AND RELEASE IT IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA WHERE ITS OXYGEN BRINGS LIFE
IT FORMS AN ACTUAL RIDGE WITH ONLY SEVENTEEN METERS OF WATER REMAINING ABOVE IT WHILE THE DEPTH ON EITHER SIDE IS 170 METERS
BE THAT AS IT MAY CAPTAIN NEMO ALSO INTRODUCED ME TO THE DIFFERENT DATA HE HAD OBTAINED ON THE RELATIVE DENSITIES OF THE WATER IN OUR GLOBE'S CHIEF SEAS
I SAW LITTLE OF THE CAPTAIN
HE SPOTTED THE DUGONG
I KNOCKED AGAIN THEN TRIED THE KNOB
I STARED AT THE LAST RAYS WREATHING THIS PEAK WHILE SHADOWS WERE GRADUALLY CLIMBING ITS GRADIENTS
THEN A DOOR OPENED INTO THE GALLEY 3 METERS LONG AND LOCATED BETWEEN THE VESSEL'S HUGE STORAGE LOCKERS
CARRIED BY THE GANGES TO THE HIGH SEAS THESE WERE DECEASED INDIAN VILLAGERS WHO HADN'T BEEN FULLY DEVOURED BY VULTURES THE ONLY MORTICIANS IN THESE PARTS
YOUR MATTRESS WAS MADE FROM THE OCEAN'S SOFTEST EELGRASS
BUT NOT WITHOUT PRAYING LIKE A GOOD HINDU FOR THE FAVORS OF THE RADIANT ORB
THAT'S HOW THICK THE ICEBERG WAS
IF CIRCUMSTANCES ARE IN OUR FAVOR BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN THIS EVENING WE'LL BE LANDING ON SOME PIECE OF SOLID GROUND OR WE'LL BE DEAD
THE DYNAMIC POWER OF MY ENGINES IS NEARLY INFINITE
THIS CLEARING WAS A CEMETERY THIS HOLE A GRAVE THAT OBLONG OBJECT THE BODY OF THE MAN WHO MUST HAVE DIED DURING THE NIGHT
OFTEN THE SEAFLOOR ROSE TO WITHIN TWO METERS OF THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
IF A SEA EXISTS AT THE SOUTH POLE IT'S POSSIBLE THIS SEA MAY BE COMPLETELY FROZEN OVER SO WE COULDN'T COME UP TO THE SURFACE MY DEAR SIR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT THE NAUTILUS IS ARMED WITH A FEARSOME SPUR
MEANWHILE I HAD ASSUMED THIS REST PERIOD WOULD BE THE TURNING POINT IN OUR STROLL BUT I WAS MISTAKEN
ENOUGH WAS IT A VOW OF REPENTANCE THAT HAD JUST ESCAPED FROM THIS MAN'S CONSCIENCE
I'VE GOTTEN HOLD OF A MONKEY WRENCH TO UNSCREW THE NUTS BOLTING THE SKIFF TO THE NAUTILUS'S HULL
THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT CROSSED MY MIND
ELSEWHERE CONSEIL PUT IN SHAKING HIS HEAD
ON THE OTHER HAND GOOD SENSE DECREES THAT WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE THE NAUTILUS FINE PROFESSOR ARONNAX THAT'S WISELY SAID BUT ONE PROVISO I SAID JUST ONE
YOU NEVER ALLOW YOURSELF ANY DISPLAYS OF BILE OR ATTACKS OF NERVES
THEIR DOMINION EXTENDED EVEN TO EGYPT
WE'RE IN LONGITUDE 137 DEGREES 15 WEST OF THE MERIDIAN OF PARIS AND LATITUDE 30 DEGREES 7 NORTH IN OTHER WORDS ABOUT 300 MILES FROM THE SHORES OF JAPAN
AN ESCAPE ATTEMPT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE FEASIBLE ASSUMING NED LAND MANAGED TO SEIZE THE SKIFF WITHOUT THE CAPTAIN'S KNOWLEDGE
THE PHILOSOPHER DIDEROT HAS VERY APTLY CLAIMED THAT A MAN'S BEARING IS THE CLUE TO HIS CHARACTER AND THIS STOCKY LITTLE MAN WAS CERTAINLY A LIVING PROOF OF THIS CLAIM
HATE SWALLOWS HIM WHOLE
THAT DIAL I SEE THERE WITH THE NEEDLE MOVING ACROSS IT--ISN'T IT A PRESSURE GAUGE IT IS INDEED A PRESSURE GAUGE
I GOT UP QUICKLY DRESSED AND WENT INTO THE LOUNGE
THE HATCHES CLOSED ONCE MORE AND OUR COURSE WAS SET DUE WEST
AND ALL THAT'S LEFT IS FOR ME TO SHOULDER MY RIFLE
FOR PART OF THE NIGHT THE NOVELTY OF OUR CIRCUMSTANCES KEPT CONSEIL AND ME AT THE LOUNGE WINDOW
NEAR FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON UNABLE TO CONTROL THE IMPATIENCE AND UNEASINESS DEVOURING ME I WENT BACK TO THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY
TURRET SNAILS OLIVE SHELLS OF THE TENT OLIVE SPECIES WITH NEATLY INTERSECTING LINES AND RUSSET SPOTS STANDING OUT SHARPLY AGAINST A FLESH-COLORED BACKGROUND FANCIFUL SPIDER CONCHS THAT LOOKED LIKE PETRIFIED SCORPIONS TRANSPARENT GLASS SNAILS ARGONAUTS SOME HIGHLY EDIBLE CUTTLEFISH AND CERTAIN SPECIES OF SQUID THAT THE NATURALISTS OF ANTIQUITY CLASSIFIED WITH THE FLYING FISH WHICH ARE USED CHIEFLY AS BAIT FOR CATCHING COD
I'M A PROFESSIONAL HARPOONER
I REGRETTED THAT
PERFECTLY CLEAR I SAID NOT YET KNOWING WHY I WAS BEING GIVEN THIS HISTORY LESSON
MOREOVER THE EXPLOSIONS GREW MORE INTENSELY AUDIBLE
OBSERVING CONSEIL I DISCOVERED THAT JUST BARELY THE GALLANT LAD HAD FALLEN UNDER THE GENERAL INFLUENCE
NO DOUBT NED LAND UNDERSTOOD THIS BECAUSE HE SAID NOTHING TO ME
SEVERAL TIMES THE ANIMAL LET US APPROACH
IT COVERS SEVEN-TENTHS OF THE PLANET EARTH
NEVERTHELESS WE CAN'T PREVENT A LOSS OF BALANCE FROM TAKING ITS TOLL
I WATCHED THEIR STROKES VIGOROUSLY CATCH THE WATER AND THEY ALWAYS WAITED TEN SECONDS BEFORE ROWING AGAIN FOLLOWING THE PRACTICE USED IN MOST NAVIES
AND SOON PROFESSOR YOU ALSO WILL HAVE CLEARED MY ARABIC TUNNEL CHAPTER 5 ARABIAN TUNNEL THE SAME DAY I REPORTED TO CONSEIL AND NED LAND THAT PART OF THE FOREGOING CONVERSATION DIRECTLY CONCERNING THEM
MOREOVER IN ORDER TO COME BACK UP IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO EXPEL THE EXCESS WATER AND OUR PUMPS MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE OUTSIDE PRESSURE
HOW MANY CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THESE OPAQUE MISTS
CHAPTER 2 THE PROS AND CONS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THESE DEVELOPMENTS WERE OCCURRING I HAD RETURNED FROM A SCIENTIFIC UNDERTAKING ORGANIZED TO EXPLORE THE NEBRASKA BADLANDS IN THE UNITED STATES
IT WILL BE A REALLY UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS I ADDED IN AN INSINUATING TONE
FOR MY PART I WAS SIMPLY DISTRESSED TO SEE THIS DUGONG OUTWIT OUR EVERY SCHEME
THIS RATHER SHADY CONDUCT AROUSED THE SUSPICION THAT THE NATIVES HAD MISTREATED THE CASTAWAYS
BUT THE AIR TANKS WERE KEPT FULL FOR ANY EVENTUALITY AND WOULD FUNCTION APPROPRIATELY TO SHOOT A FEW CUBIC METERS OF OXYGEN INTO THE NAUTILUS'S THIN ATMOSPHERE
THE LATTER TOOK UP RESIDENCE ON THE ISLAND AND BUILT A SMALLER CRAFT WITH RUBBLE FROM THE TWO LARGE ONES
WE WERE SILENT
THE MOST LEARNED MEN THE CAPTAIN SAID STILL HAVE MUCH TO LEARN
RIGHT NOW NOTHING IS CLEAR TO ME I STILL GLIMPSE ONLY GLIMMERS IN THE DARK AND I MUST LIMIT MY PEN AS IT WERE TO TAKING DICTATION FROM EVENTS
MAY THE CONTEMPLATION OF SO MANY WONDERS EXTINGUISH THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE IN HIM
I STARED
I STARED
AS FOR THE RUHMKORFF LAMPS THEY WERE UNNECESSARY IN THE MIDST OF THESE BRILLIANT WATERS SATURATED WITH OUR ELECTRIC RAYS
FROM THE EIGHTY-NINTH FISH GENUS IN LACéPèDE'S SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION BELONGING TO HIS SECOND SUBCLASS OF BONY FISH CHARACTERIZED BY GILL COVERS AND A BRONCHIAL MEMBRANE I NOTED SOME SCORPIONFISH WHOSE HEADS ARE ADORNED WITH STINGS AND WHICH HAVE ONLY ONE DORSAL FIN
IN ESSENCE WE WERE THEN CROSSING THAT PART OF THE WHOLE MEDITERRANEAN SO FERTILE IN CASUALTIES
I HEARD THE WEAPON COLLIDE RESONANTLY AS IF IT HAD HIT SOME HARD SUBSTANCE
PART OF THIS VOYAGE UNDER THE SEAS
THE SUN FAIRLY LOW ON THE HORIZON STRUCK FULL FORCE ON THE HOUSES IN THIS TOWN ACCENTING THEIR WHITENESS
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR HE CALLED TO ME
NUMEROUS BLACKISH PATCHES WERE SPREADING OVER ITS SURFACE ANNOUNCING THE IMMINENT FORMATION OF FRESH ICE
EXQUISITE CONSEIL REPLIED
IT WAS WRITTEN IN A SCRIPT THAT WAS CLEAR AND NEAT BUT A BIT OLD ENGLISH IN STYLE ITS CHARACTERS REMINDING ME OF GERMAN CALLIGRAPHY
SINCE CONDITIONS INSIDE WERE UNIVERSALLY UNBEARABLE HOW EAGERLY HOW HAPPILY WE PUT ON OUR DIVING SUITS TO TAKE OUR TURNS WORKING
AND SINCE I KNEW IT HAD APPEARED IN THE COURSE OF 1865 I CONCLUDED THAT THE FITTING OUT OF THE NAUTILUS HADN'T TAKEN PLACE BEFORE THEN
HIS FACE WAS PALE FROM SOME SPASM OF HIS HEART WHICH MUST HAVE STOPPED BEATING FOR AN INSTANT
STILL THEY'RE MERELY BIRDS CONSEIL SAID
IF DURING OUR TRIP WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THESE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF FISH IT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE ATTRACTED BY OUR ELECTRIC LIGHT AND TRIED TO FOLLOW ALONGSIDE
IT SEEMED AS IF WE'D PLUNGED INTO A POOL OF QUICKSILVER
WHEN THIS STRANGER FOCUSED HIS GAZE ON AN OBJECT HIS EYEBROW LINES GATHERED INTO A FROWN HIS HEAVY EYELIDS CLOSED AROUND HIS PUPILS TO CONTRACT HIS HUGE FIELD OF VISION AND HE LOOKED
THE BLADES OF ITS PROPELLER WEREN'T CHURNING THE WAVES
NOR DID WE HAVE ANY WAY TO COUNTER CAPTAIN NEMO'S WHIMS
I TRIED IN VAIN TO RECOVER MY COMPOSURE
TO GREEKS SIMPLY THE SEA TO HEBREWS THE GREAT SEA TO ROMANS MARE NOSTRUM BORDERED BY ORANGE TREES ALOES CACTUS AND MARITIME PINE TREES PERFUMED WITH THE SCENT OF MYRTLE FRAMED BY RUGGED MOUNTAINS SATURATED WITH CLEAN TRANSPARENT AIR BUT CONTINUOUSLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION BY FIRES IN THE EARTH THIS SEA IS A GENUINE BATTLEFIELD WHERE NEPTUNE AND PLUTO STILL STRUGGLE FOR WORLD DOMINATION
DURING THOSE NINETEEN DAYS JUST MENTIONED NO UNIQUE INCIDENTS DISTINGUISHED OUR VOYAGE
THEN THE WATERS OF THE ATLANTIC RUSHED INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN
BY ACTING IN THIS WAY I SHIELD YOU FROM COMPLICITY I ABSOLVE YOU OF ALL RESPONSIBILITY SINCE I MYSELF MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO SEE WHAT YOU AREN'T MEANT TO SEE
WE WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A SHIP WHOSE SEVERED SHROUDS STILL HUNG FROM THEIR CLASPS
THESE WERE AUKS AS AGILE AND SUPPLE IN WATER WHERE THEY ARE SOMETIMES MISTAKEN FOR FAST BONITO AS THEY ARE CLUMSY AND HEAVY ON LAND
HE CAN RELY ON ME TO TOW HIM TO THAT VESSEL IF HE'S AGREEABLE TO GOING WITH OUR FRIEND NED BEFORE I COULD REPLY WHITE SMOKE STREAMED FROM THE BATTLESHIP'S BOW
WE SINCERELY BELIEVED IN MASTER'S NARWHALE WE WERE WRONG CONSEIL NO DOUBT BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WITH NO DOUBTS WHO BELIEVE TO THIS DAY PROBABLY CONSEIL
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC TINY INFUSORIA BUILD CONTINENTS BUT HERE THEY'RE BUILT BY VOLCANIC PHENOMENA
ONE PART OF CAPTAIN NEMO'S SECRET LIFE HAD BEEN UNVEILED
AND I DON'T NEED YOUR COLORS TO RECOGNIZE YOU
HIS TALES TOOK ON THE FORM OF AN EPIC POEM AND I FELT I WAS HEARING SOME CANADIAN HOMER RECITING HIS ILIAD OF THE HIGH ARCTIC REGIONS
HUNTED AND TRAPPED BY FISHERMEN THIS VALUABLE CARNIVORE HAS BECOME EXTREMELY RARE AND IT TAKES REFUGE CHIEFLY IN THE NORTHERNMOST PARTS OF THE PACIFIC WHERE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD ITS SPECIES WILL SOON BE FACING EXTINCTION
IN THESE DEEP STRATA WOULD I MEET UP WITH MORE OF CAPTAIN NEMO'S COMPANIONS FRIENDS HE WAS ABOUT TO VISIT WHO LED LIVES AS STRANGE AS HIS OWN
NO MORE POSITIONS WERE REPORTED ON THE WORLD MAP
TREE TRUNKS RIPPED FROM THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS OR THE ANDES AND SENT FLOATING DOWN THE AMAZON OR THE MISSISSIPPI NUMEROUS PIECES OF WRECKAGE REMNANTS OF KEELS OR UNDERSIDES BULWARKS STAVED IN AND SO WEIGHED DOWN WITH SEASHELLS AND BARNACLES THEY COULDN'T RISE TO THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
THE UNDULATING WAVES REGULARLY TOOK ON THE APPEARANCE OF WATERED SILK WITH WIDE STRIPES
ARE YOU TIRED OF THIS VOYAGE UNDER THE SEAS
THE GAFF OF ITS FORE-AND-AFT SAIL FLEW NO FLAG
SO WE HAD TO SAVE IT NO NED I REPLIED IT ISN'T WORTH MORE
IT CONSISTED OF TURTLE SOUP MADE FROM THE DAINTIEST HAWKSBILL A RED MULLET WITH WHITE SLIGHTLY FLAKY FLESH WHOSE LIVER WHEN SEPARATELY PREPARED MAKES DELICIOUS EATING PLUS LOIN OF IMPERIAL ANGELFISH WHOSE FLAVOR STRUCK ME AS EVEN BETTER THAN SALMON
AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE MIST ROLLED PONDEROUSLY OVER THE WAVES AND ITS HUGE CURLS WERE LIFTING LITTLE BY LITTLE
WE LAY RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE HARBOR OF VANA LOCATED IN LATITUDE 16 DEGREES 4 SOUTH AND LONGITUDE 164 DEGREES 32 EAST
I LIKEWISE HOPE THAT HIS POWERFUL SUBMERSIBLE HAS DEFEATED THE SEA INSIDE ITS MOST DREADFUL WHIRLPOOL THAT THE NAUTILUS HAS SURVIVED WHERE SO MANY SHIPS HAVE PERISHED
I HAD TO ADMIT THAT CAPTAIN NEMO'S LEADERSHIP HAD BEEN MOST INJUDICIOUS
A SUDDEN JOLT THREW ME DOWN
AFTER OUR POSITION HAD BEEN MARKED ON THE CHART I SAW THAT WE WERE PASSING INTO THE MOUTH OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL THAT OUR HEADING WOULD TAKE US TO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS WITH INCOMPARABLE SPEED
AND SO CAPTAIN NEMO WOULD LIVE OUT HIS LIFE ENTIRELY IN THE HEART OF THIS IMMENSE SEA AND EVEN HIS GRAVE LAY READY IN ITS IMPENETRABLE DEPTHS
HAD THE CREW SEEN ME GO OVERBOARD
INSTANTLY THERE HE WAS THROWN ON HIS BACK LEGS IN THE AIR HIS BODY HALF PARALYZED AND YELLING
IN THESE STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES THE SCOPE FOR CONJECTURE WAS UNLIMITED
I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT NATION IT'S FROM
SO I HAD TO RESIGN MYSELF TO MY FATE AND GET READY TO ESCAPE
YES WE ARE CERTAINLY I REPLIED EVASIVELY BUT AFTER WE MAKE A DETOUR WHATEVER DETOUR MASTER WISHES OH IT'S NOTHING REALLY
AMONG OTHERS I NOTED SOME LONG-FINNED ALBACORE A SPECIES IN THE GENUS SCOMBER AS BIG AS TUNA BLUISH ON THE FLANKS AND STREAKED WITH CROSSWISE STRIPES THAT DISAPPEAR WHEN THE ANIMAL DIES
UNDER THAT TONGUE OF LAND NATURE LONG AGO MADE WHAT MAN TODAY IS MAKING ON ITS SURFACE WHAT
THAT EXPLAINS THE PHOSPHORESCENT GLOW FROM THIS SO-CALLED NARWHALE THAT SO PUZZLED US SCIENTISTS
NOT EVEN THE SWIFTEST FISH OR BIRDS COULD KEEP UP WITH US AND THE NATURAL CURIOSITIES IN THESE SEAS COMPLETELY ELUDED OUR OBSERVATION
IT LIGHTS ME IT WARMS ME IT'S THE SOUL OF MY MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT
LOOK AT THIS OCEAN PROFESSOR
AND IF I DESIRE THAT THE NAUTILUS EMERGE ABOVE THE WAVES TO ONE-TENTH OF ITS TOTAL CAPACITY I EMPTY ALL THE BALLAST TANKS COMPLETELY THIS LOGIC BACKED UP BY FIGURES LEFT ME WITHOUT A SINGLE OBJECTION
I'M FEEDING YOU THE FACTS BY THUNDER
THE ORDER CETACEA CONSISTS OF THREE FAMILIES BALEEN WHALES SPERM WHALES DOLPHINS AND IT'S IN THIS LAST GROUP THAT NARWHALES ARE PLACED
I ADMIT CAPTAIN I'M NOT YET ON VERY FAMILIAR TERMS WITH THAT GENUS OF FISH WE'RE USED TO THEM THE REST OF US CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED
LOOK
LOOK
SO THE ADDED WEIGHT WOULD ONLY BE 6.57 METRIC TONS THAT'S ALL THAT'S ALL PROFESSOR ARONNAX AND THE CALCULATION IS EASY TO CHECK
WE'VE GOT TO TALK TO THE CAPTAIN
EVERY VARIETY OF COWRY USED AS MONEY IN INDIA AND AFRICA
THE LOUNGE WAS PLUNGED IN PROFOUND DARKNESS
THAT RASCAL MUST BE COVERED WITH SIX-INCH ARMOR PLATE CURSE THE BEAST COMMANDER FARRAGUT SHOUTED
NO DOUBT IT WOULD STRAIGHTEN UP ONCE THE BLOCK CAME TO A HALT
A BORN STOIC PUNCTILIOUS ON PRINCIPLE HABITUALLY HARDWORKING RARELY STARTLED BY LIFE'S SURPRISES VERY SKILLFUL WITH HIS HANDS EFFICIENT IN HIS EVERY DUTY AND DESPITE HIS HAVING A NAME THAT MEANS COUNSEL NEVER GIVING ADVICE NOT EVEN THE UNSOLICITED KIND
YOUR WORD THAT YOU'LL SUBMIT TO IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT GO ON SIR I REPLIED
IT WHEELED ON THE SKIFF TO ASSAULT US IN ITS TURN
WITHOUT THE HIGH QUALITY OF ITS HULL THE MORAVIAN WOULD SURELY HAVE SPLIT OPEN FROM THIS COLLISION AND GONE DOWN TOGETHER WITH THOSE 237 PASSENGERS IT WAS BRINGING BACK FROM CANADA
BUT SOME MOMENTS LATER WHEN HE TURNED TO ME I THREW BACK AT HIM A PHRASE HE HAD USED IN THE TORRES STRAIT
HIT BY AN ELECTRIC BULLET THE PIG DROPPED DEAD ON THE SPOT
SOON IN THE SHADOWS I SPOTTED A PALE SIGNAL LIGHT GLIMMERING A MILE AWAY HALF DISCOLORED BY MIST
WE WALKED WITH STEADY STEPS THAT RANG ON THE SEAFLOOR WITH ASTONISHING INTENSITY
THERE CONSEIL'S WORK CAME TO A HALT
THAT'S WHY THE COUNT DE BUFFON'S ENCYCLOPEDIA SAYS THAT CETACEANS CAN LIVE AND EVEN MUST LIVE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS
THE COAST TO THE EAST LOOKED LIKE A SLIGHTLY BLURRED MASS IN A DAMP FOG
BUT IF MY HANDS CAME NEAR THE MOVING FLOWERS OF THESE SENSITIVE LIVELY CREATURES AN ALARM WOULD INSTANTLY SOUND THROUGHOUT THE COLONY
INDEED WE HAD STRUCK BOTTOM TO USE NAUTICAL TERMINOLOGY BUT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND AT A DEPTH OF 3,000 FEET
AND NOW PROFESSOR THE CAPTAIN ADDED I'LL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR INTELLECTUAL PURSUITS
IN ESSENCE THESE NETS STAYED IN OUR WAKE FOR SEVERAL HOURS INCARCERATING AN ENTIRE AQUATIC WORLD IN PRISONS MADE OF THREAD
THIS WAS THE REMORA WHICH TRAVELS ATTACHED TO THE BELLIES OF SHARKS
NED LAND STILL KEPT UP THE MOST TENACIOUS SKEPTICISM
A DESERTED IMMENSENESS
SO HERE WE ARE BACK ON SHORE CONSEIL SAID
MOST OF THESE DISHES ARE NEW TO YOU HE TOLD ME
OTHERS LOOKED LIKE UPSIDE-DOWN BASKETS FROM WHICH WIDE LEAVES AND LONG RED TWIGS WERE GRACEFULLY TRAILING
A FLASH OF ANGER AND SCORN LIT UP THE STRANGER'S EYES AND I GLIMPSED A FEARSOME PAST IN THIS MAN'S LIFE
OH IF ONLY WE HAD THE CHEMICAL METHODS THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO DRIVE OUT THIS NOXIOUS GAS
TO ME RESEARCH IS A RELIEF A POTENT DIVERSION AN ENTICEMENT A PASSION THAT CAN MAKE ME FORGET EVERYTHING ELSE
WOULD CAPTAIN NEMO HEAD UP NORTH AND BEACH US ON THE BRITISH ISLES
BATFISH A SORT OF REDDISH ISOSCELES TRIANGLE HALF A METER LONG WHOSE PECTORAL FINS ARE ATTACHED BY FLESHY EXTENSIONS THAT MAKE THESE FISH LOOK LIKE BATS ALTHOUGH AN APPENDAGE MADE OF HORN LOCATED NEAR THE NOSTRILS EARNS THEM THE NICKNAME OF SEA UNICORNS
QUIVERING VIOLENTLY ITS TAIL WAS CREATING A CONSIDERABLE EDDY
I SHARED MY THOUGHTS AND FEARS WITH CAPTAIN NEMO
HE STARED AT THE SHIP WHICH STAYED TO HIS LEEWARD FIVE OR SIX MILES OFF
I INSTINCTIVELY RECOILED
THESE PERFECTED DIVING SUITS IT WAS EASY TO SEE WERE A FAR CRY FROM SUCH MISSHAPEN COSTUMES AS THE CORK BREASTPLATES LEATHER JUMPERS SEAGOING TUNICS BARREL HELMETS ETC INVENTED AND ACCLAIMED IN THE 18TH CENTURY
WHO EVER HEARD OF SUCH MALARKEY NED MY FRIEND CONSEIL REPLIED HAD YOU EVER HEARD OF THE NAUTILUS
ONLY WHEN WE SEE THE FISHERIES WE'LL SEE NO FISHERMEN
AS SOON AS ONE SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED ANOTHER WAS READY TO GO OFF
SO WE'RE IN GOD'S HANDS AND I'LL SEE YOU THIS EVENING THIS SAID THE CANADIAN WITHDREW LEAVING ME CLOSE TO DUMBFOUNDED
THE OTHER PEARLS THAT STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL ARE MORE ERRATICALLY SHAPED AND ARE PRICED BY WEIGHT
BUT THE LINES OF RIVETS HAD BEEN FIRMLY DRIVEN INTO THE SHEET-IRON JOINS AND WERE STRAIGHT AND UNIFORM
THE SKIES WERE THREATENING BUT LAND LAY INSIDE THOSE DENSE MISTS AND WE HAD TO ESCAPE
ONE ANIMAL NO LESS HIDEOUS WHICH I ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL TIMES WAS THE ENORMOUS CRAB THAT MR DARWIN OBSERVED TO WHICH NATURE HAS GIVEN THE INSTINCT AND REQUISITE STRENGTH TO EAT COCONUTS
I CONSULTED THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS
SO IT'S OBVIOUS THAT NEA AND PALEA WILL JOIN IN DAYS TO COME
SO DISTINCT IS ITS CURRENT FROM THE SURROUNDING SEA ITS CONFINED WATERS STAND OUT AGAINST THE OCEAN AND OPERATE ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL FROM THE COLDER WATERS
THE NAUTILUS WAS BRAZENLY SWALLOWED UP
LAYERS OF CLOUDS CLOAKED THE SKY AND LEFT ONLY A FEW STARS IN VIEW
MY NOTES NOTHING MORE
WHAT A SIGHT
WHAT A SIGHT
ONLY TWO PERSONS FACE EACH OTHER HERE
CAPTAIN NEMO RESUMED THE LEAD IN OUR LITTLE BAND ALWAYS HEADING FORWARD WITHOUT HESITATION
THE SAME DAY AN ODD FISHING PRACTICE FURTHER INCREASED THE NAUTILUS'S STORES SO FULL OF GAME WERE THESE SEAS
THAT NIGHT I SLEPT POORLY AND BETWEEN MY FITFUL DREAMS I THOUGHT I HEARD A DISTANT MOANING LIKE A FUNERAL DIRGE
GLEAMING WITH DARK FIRE HIS EYES HAD SHRUNK BENEATH HIS FROWNING BROW
A MARBLED TURBAN SNAIL GLEAMING WITH MOTHER-OF-PEARL
NED LAND CONCEDED THIS HIMSELF
NOW THEN I WENT ON THE NAUTILUS'S CAPACITY IS 1,500 METRIC TONS AND THAT OF A TON IS 1,000 LITERS SO THE NAUTILUS HOLDS 1,500,000 LITERS OF AIR WHICH DIVIDED BY 2,400 I DID A QUICK PENCIL CALCULATION
MOREOVER THEY'RE JUST AS VORACIOUS AS DOGFISH IF I CAN BELIEVE A CERTAIN COPENHAGEN PROFESSOR WHO SAYS THAT FROM ONE DOLPHIN'S STOMACH HE REMOVED THIRTEEN PORPOISES AND FIFTEEN SEALS
CONSEIL NED AND I SAT IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE WINDOWS
ULTIMATELY WHEN HE CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER HE'LL STOP I WOULDN'T BET ON IT I REPLIED
SO THIS WAS THE SUBMERGED REGION THAT HAD EXISTED OUTSIDE EUROPE ASIA AND LIBYA BEYOND THE PILLARS OF HERCULES HOME OF THOSE POWERFUL ATLANTEAN PEOPLE AGAINST WHOM ANCIENT GREECE HAD WAGED ITS EARLIEST WARS
FOR THE TIME BEING GET RID OF THESE NOTIONS OF TAKING OVER THE NAUTILUS OR ESCAPING FROM IT
A FEW MOMENTS LATER EIGHT STRAPPING FELLOWS APPEARED SILENTLY THEIR FACES LIKE MASKS AND DRAGGED US DOWN INTO THEIR FEARSOME MACHINE
THE SKIFF WAS LAUNCHED TO SEA
IN ESSENCE THE NARWHALE IS ARMED WITH A SORT OF IVORY SWORD OR LANCE AS CERTAIN NATURALISTS HAVE EXPRESSED IT
I COULD EASILY DISTINGUISH OBJECTS 100 METERS AWAY
FARTHER OFF A SUCCESSION OF STEEPLY CUT CLIFFS SPORTING A GRAYISH TINT HUGE MIRRORS THAT REFLECTED THE SPARSE RAYS OF A SUN HALF DROWNED IN MIST
FINALLY COMMON PERIWINKLES DELPHINULA SNAILS TURRET SNAILS VIOLET SNAILS EUROPEAN COWRIES VOLUTE SNAILS OLIVE SHELLS MITER SHELLS HELMET SHELLS MUREX SNAILS WHELKS HARP SHELLS SPIKY PERIWINKLES TRITON SNAILS HORN SHELLS SPINDLE SHELLS CONCH SHELLS SPIDER CONCHS LIMPETS GLASS SNAILS SEA BUTTERFLIES EVERY KIND OF DELICATE FRAGILE SEASHELL THAT SCIENCE HAS BAPTIZED WITH ITS MOST DELIGHTFUL NAMES
INTENSE NIGHTMARES BESIEGED ME
DID MASTER GET BITTEN NO MY BOY BUT I'D GLADLY HAVE SACRIFICED A FINGER FOR SUCH A FIND WHAT FIND THIS SHELL I SAID DISPLAYING THE SUBJECT OF MY TRIUMPH
BUT LOWER DOWN WHILE DIVING BENEATH THAT SURFACE ISN'T YOUR SUBMERSIBLE GOING TO ENCOUNTER A PRESSURE AND CONSEQUENTLY UNDERGO AN UPWARD THRUST THAT MUST BE ASSESSED AT ONE ATMOSPHERE PER EVERY THIRTY FEET OF WATER HENCE AT ABOUT ONE KILOGRAM PER EACH SQUARE CENTIMETER PRECISELY SIR THEN UNLESS YOU FILL UP THE WHOLE NAUTILUS I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN FORCE IT DOWN INTO THE HEART OF THESE LIQUID MASSES PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED STATIC OBJECTS MUSTN'T BE CONFUSED WITH DYNAMIC ONES OR WE'LL BE OPEN TO SERIOUS ERROR
VERNE IS OFTEN DUBBED IN ISAAC ASIMOV'S PHRASE THE WORLD'S FIRST SCIENCE-FICTION WRITER AND IT'S TRUE MANY OF HIS SIXTY-ODD BOOKS DO ANTICIPATE FUTURE EVENTS AND TECHNOLOGIES
NED SAW WITH PLEASURE THAT THIS COURSE WOULD BRING US ONCE AGAIN CLOSER TO EUROPEAN SEAS
ITS TONGUE ALSO OF HORN SUBSTANCE AND ARMED WITH SEVERAL ROWS OF SHARP TEETH WOULD FLICKER OUT FROM BETWEEN THESE GENUINE SHEARS
MANEUVERS THAT AREN'T FEASIBLE FOR AN ORDINARY SHIP ARE EASY FOR THE NAUTILUS
WHERE'S THAT SHIP FROM I'VE NO IDEA
NO ONE IS UNAWARE OF THE NAME OF THAT FAMOUS ENGLISH SHIPOWNER CUNARD
THE NAME SARGASSO COMES FROM THE SPANISH WORD SARGAZO MEANING GULFWEED
OUR COMPASS INDICATIONS NO LONGER OFFERED ANY GUARANTEES
AND SINCE HE AND NED WERE NOW FAST FRIENDS HE JUST HAD TO SHOW OFF
BUT WE HAD TO KEEP WALKING AND WE WENT FORWARD WHILE OVERHEAD THERE SCUDDED SCHOOLS OF PORTUGUESE MEN-OF-WAR THAT LET THEIR ULTRAMARINE TENTACLES DRIFT IN THEIR WAKES MEDUSAS WHOSE MILKY WHITE OR DAINTY PINK PARASOLS WERE FESTOONED WITH AZURE TASSELS AND SHADED US FROM THE SUN'S RAYS PLUS JELLYFISH OF THE SPECIES PELAGIA PANOPYRA THAT IN THE DARK WOULD HAVE STREWN OUR PATH WITH PHOSPHORESCENT GLIMMERS
CAPTAIN ANDERSON CALLED AN IMMEDIATE HALT AND ONE OF HIS SAILORS DIVED DOWN TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE
WE COULD SUCK THE ATOMS FROM THE AIR BY THE LUNGFUL AND IT WAS THE BREEZE THE BREEZE ITSELF THAT POURED INTO US THIS LUXURIOUS INTOXICATION
THE HATCH CLOSED THE BALLAST TANKS FILLED WITH WATER AND THE SUBMERSIBLE SANK SOME TEN METERS DOWN
FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON 259 18
GOOD LORD PROFESSOR NED LAND ANSWERED ME DON'T MENTION IT
WHAT IF WE NEVER RETURN TO IT NED LAND ADDED
ITS LEVEL--AS INDICATED BY THE PRESSURE GAUGE--WOULD BE THE SAME AS THE OUTSIDE LEVEL BECAUSE SOME CONNECTION HAD TO EXIST BETWEEN THIS LAKE AND THE SEA
PEARLS RESULT SIMPLY FROM MOTHER-OF-PEARL SOLIDIFYING INTO A GLOBULAR SHAPE
WE MUST CONFER WITH CAPTAIN NEMO CONSEIL SAID
SATURATED WITH THE OUTSIDE LIGHT MY EYES COULDN'T MAKE OUT A THING
GET BACK INSIDE FROM WHAT COUNTRY IS THAT SHIP YOU DON'T KNOW
I HAD LEFT MYSELF A LOOPHOLE
THERE'S A PASSAGEWAY YES AN UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY THAT I'VE NAMED THE ARABIAN TUNNEL
AS FOR FISH THEY WERE NUMEROUS AND OFTEN REMARKABLE
BUT OUR SUCKERFISH WOULD EFFECT THEIR CAPTURE WITH EXTRAORDINARY CERTAINTY AND PRECISION
TO BE MORE ACCURATE I SHOULD HAVE SAID TO THE NORTHEAST
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS DRAW IT FROM AN AD HOC SPIGOT BESIDES PROFESSOR ARONNAX YOU'LL SEE FOR YOURSELF THAT DURING THESE UNDERWATER HUNTING TRIPS WE MAKE NO GREAT EXPENDITURE OF EITHER AIR OR BULLETS LATIN
WHEN I FINISHED HE DIDN'T PRONOUNCE A SINGLE WORD
CAPTAIN NEMO AND MY TWO COMPANIONS SUITED UP AS WELL
BESIDES HOW SHOULD WE ATTACK THIS UNKNOWN CREATURE HOW SHOULD WE DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST IT
FROM THE WHITE IT HAD RECENTLY BEEN THE SEA WAS TURNING RED A COLORATION CAUSED BY THE PRESENCE OF IRON SALTS
THEY WERE A BREED OF TRAWL RESEMBLING THOSE USED OFF THE NORMANDY COAST HUGE POUCHES HELD HALF OPEN BY A FLOATING POLE AND A CHAIN LACED THROUGH THE LOWER MESHES
THERE ITS WATERS STILL WEAK IN TEMPERATURE AND COLOR BEGIN TO FORM
IT'S WORTHLESS MAYBE THAT'S WHY KATE TENDER MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE REPLIED MR LAND PHILOSOPHICALLY
CORRECT MR NATURALIST HE ANSWERED ME AND WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT THEM AT CLOSE QUARTERS I GAPED AT THE CAPTAIN
WE'RE GOING TO RID THE SEAS OF IT
CAPTAIN NEMO CONSEIL NED LAND AND I FOUND SEATS IN THE STERN OF THE SKIFF
IT TOOK US TWO HOURS TO REACH THE SUMMIT OF THIS HALF-CRYSTAL HALF-BASALT PEAK
I OFTEN HEARD THEM REPEAT THE WORD ASSAI AND FROM THEIR GESTURES I UNDERSTOOD THEY WERE INVITING ME TO GO ASHORE AN INVITATION I FELT OBLIGED TO DECLINE
A BREEZE WAS BLOWING NOISILY FROM THE WEST AND DISHEVELED BY THE WIND LONG BILLOWS MADE THE SUBMERSIBLE ROLL VERY NOTICEABLY
AS FOR MY ACCOUNT OF THIS EXCURSION UNDER THE WATERS I'M WELL AWARE THAT IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE
BECAUSE JUST AS 40,000 NEAR-INVISIBLE BUDS HAVE BEEN COUNTED IN ONE FIVE-SQUARE-MILLIMETER SPACE SO ALSO HAVE FUCUS PLANTS BEEN GATHERED THAT WERE OVER 500 METERS LONG
ITS GERM TOOK ROOT
I SEE OUR CAPTAIN'S WAY OF LIFE
ON ITS SURFACE THEY CAN STILL EXERCISE THEIR INIQUITOUS CLAIMS BATTLE EACH OTHER DEVOUR EACH OTHER HAUL EVERY EARTHLY HORROR
OFF WE GO CONSEIL REPLIED
THESE VIEWS WERE VARIED CONTINUOUSLY BY THE SUN'S OBLIQUE RAYS OR WERE COMPLETELY SWALLOWED UP BY GRAY MISTS IN THE MIDDLE OF BLIZZARDS
I'M TIED HAND AND FOOT BUT NED MY FRIEND CONSEIL SAID WHY NOT ASK CAPTAIN NEMO FOR PERMISSION TO HUNT BEFORE CONSEIL COULD FINISH HIS SENTENCE NED LAND SCOOTED DOWN THE HATCH AND RAN TO LOOK FOR THE CAPTAIN
IN FACT THERE COULD BE NO IMMEDIATE DANGER
IN THE MIDST OF THIS PLACID NATURAL SETTING SKY AND OCEAN COMPETED WITH EACH OTHER IN TRANQUILITY AND THE SEA OFFERED THE ORB OF NIGHT THE LOVELIEST MIRROR EVER TO REFLECT ITS IMAGE
I TOOK THE WOUNDED MAN'S PULSE
WE WERE DISCUSSING HE SAID THE VIEWS OF ANCIENT HISTORIANS ON THE DANGERS OF NAVIGATING THIS RED SEA TRUE I REPLIED
I COULD BARELY HEAR IT
WHERE WOULD THE MAN FLEE AFTER THIS HORRIBLE ACT OF REVENGE
THERE WERE HELIOTROPES VERY REMISS AT LIVING UP TO THEIR SUN-WORSHIPPING REPUTATIONS SINCE NO SUNLIGHT EVER REACHED THEM
YELLOW BLUE AND BLACK PEARLS THE UNUSUAL HANDIWORK OF VARIOUS MOLLUSKS FROM EVERY OCEAN AND OF CERTAIN MUSSELS FROM RIVERS UP NORTH
CHRONOMETERS WHICH ALLOW ME TO CALCULATE MY LONGITUDE
PLATO'S ATLANTIS
IT WAS FORMED BY THE LONG CURVE OF LITTLE MANNAR ISLAND
ITS FLESH IS ACTUAL RED MEAT HIGHLY PRIZED AND SET ASIDE THROUGHOUT MALAYSIA FOR THE TABLES OF ARISTOCRATS
MAMMALS REPTILES AND THOSE COUNTLESS LEGIONS OF FISH AN INFINITE ORDER OF ANIMALS TOTALING MORE THAN 13,000 SPECIES OF WHICH ONLY ONE-TENTH BELONG TO FRESH WATER
BUT THE CAPTAIN WAS RIGHT
MORE NUMEROUS THAN BIRDS IN THE AIR THESE FISH RACED RIGHT UP TO US NO DOUBT ATTRACTED BY THE BRILLIANT GLOW OF OUR ELECTRIC BEACON
DURING OUR ABSENCE THE NETS HAD BEEN SPREAD AND I OBSERVED WITH FASCINATION THE FISH JUST HAULED ON BOARD
WE WERE BEING SWEPT WESTWARD AND I ESTIMATE THAT OUR COMPARATIVELY MODERATE SPEED REACHED TWELVE MILES PER HOUR
NOW LET'S PUT ON OUR UNDERWATER SUITS AND WE'LL BEGIN OUR STROLL I DIDN'T REPLY AND WHILE STARING AT THESE SUSPICIOUS WAVES I BEGAN TO PUT ON MY HEAVY AQUATIC CLOTHES HELPED BY THE LONGBOAT'S SAILORS
I'VE EVEN HEARD THAT THOSE RORQUAL WHALES OFF THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS SOMETIMES GET OVER 150 FEET THAT STRIKES ME AS EXAGGERATED I REPLIED
THERE SPONGES GREW IN EVERY SHAPE GLOBULAR STALKLIKE LEAFLIKE FINGERLIKE
WE'LL NEED TO WALK LONG HOURS AND SCALE A MOUNTAIN
BRACING HIMSELF HE WAITED FOR THE FEARSOME MAN-EATER WITH WONDERFUL COMPOSURE AND WHEN THE LATTER RUSHED AT HIM THE CAPTAIN LEAPED ASIDE WITH PRODIGIOUS QUICKNESS AVOIDED A COLLISION AND SANK HIS DAGGER INTO ITS BELLY
IT IS ACCURATE
START NAMING THEM NED LAND EXCLAIMED
WELL NOW
122 A DREADFUL BATTLE WAS JOINED
OUR DRAGNETS BROUGHT UP MANY SPECIMENS OF POLYPS AND ECHINODERMS PLUS SOME UNUSUAL SHELLS FROM THE BRANCH MOLLUSCA
SO I WAS ABLE TO STUDY THE MADREPORIC PROCESS THAT HAS CREATED THE ISLANDS IN THIS OCEAN
MY CHEST CAVED IN AND I FAINTED
LOSING ALL SELF-CONTROL NED LAND HURLED THREATS AND INSULTS AT THEM
HEADING NORTH IT WAS CRUISING ALONG THE OCEAN'S BEACHES
NO MIDDLE OF THE ROAD FOR THESE TWO
AND I HEARD HIM MURMUR THESE WORDS THE LAST OF HIS TO REACH MY EARS
WHAT A SHAME
CENTURIES PASSED
I'M A GOOD SWIMMER WITHOUT CLAIMING TO EQUAL SUCH OTHER AUTHORS AS BYRON AND EDGAR ALLAN POE WHO WERE MASTER DIVERS AND I DIDN'T LOSE MY HEAD ON THE WAY DOWN
YES PROFESSOR THE CAPTAIN REPLIED
THE NAUTILUS DRIVEN DOWNWARD BY ITS PROPELLER AND SLANTING FINS DESCENDED TO THE LOWEST STRATA OF THIS SEA
AFTER TWO HOURS OF ENERGETIC WORK NED LAND REENTERED EXHAUSTED
WILL THE NATIONALITY OF THE STRICKEN WARSHIP TELL US THE NATIONALITY OF CAPTAIN NEMO
TO EACH HIS OWN THE CAPTAIN REPLIED STARING INTENTLY AT NED LAND
BUT JUST AS CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS CHIEF OFFICER RUSHED AT IT THE ANIMAL SHOT OFF A SPOUT OF BLACKISH LIQUID SECRETED BY A POUCH LOCATED IN ITS ABDOMEN
MUSHROOM-SHAPED FUNGUS CORAL SOME SLATE-COLORED SEA ANEMONE INCLUDING THE SPECIES THALASSIANTHUS ASTER AMONG OTHERS ORGAN-PIPE CORAL ARRANGED LIKE FLUTES AND JUST BEGGING FOR A PUFF FROM THE GOD PAN SHELLS UNIQUE TO THIS SEA THAT DWELL IN MADREPORIC CAVITIES AND WHOSE BASES ARE TWISTED INTO SQUAT SPIRALS AND FINALLY A THOUSAND SAMPLES OF A POLYPARY I HADN'T OBSERVED UNTIL THEN
NOW MY GALLANT NED DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY SQUARE CENTIMETERS YOU HAVE ON YOUR BODILY SURFACE I HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST NOTION PROFESSOR ARONNAX ABOUT 17,000 AS MANY AS THAT YES AND SINCE THE ATMOSPHERE'S PRESSURE ACTUALLY WEIGHS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN ONE KILOGRAM PER SQUARE CENTIMETER YOUR 17,000 SQUARE CENTIMETERS ARE TOLERATING 17,568 KILOGRAMS AT THIS VERY MOMENT WITHOUT MY NOTICING IT WITHOUT YOUR NOTICING IT
THE UPPER STRATA WERE TOO VIOLENTLY AGITATED
BY THEN THE FRIGATE LAY IN LATITUDE 31 DEGREES 15 NORTH AND LONGITUDE 136 DEGREES 42 EAST
THEY OBVIOUSLY WERE TRUE PAPUANS MEN OF FINE STOCK ATHLETIC IN BUILD FOREHEAD HIGH AND BROAD NOSE LARGE BUT NOT FLAT TEETH WHITE
WAS IT THE VOICE OF SOME POOR DEVIL LEFT BEHIND IN MIDOCEAN SOME OTHER VICTIM OF THAT COLLISION SUFFERED BY OUR SHIP
I WANTED TO ESTABLISH ONE SUPREME IMPRESSION IN MY MIND
LONG BORES WERE DRIVEN INTO THE SIDE WALLS
THIS TIME THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE
HERE AND IN THE SHADOWS BIRDS OF PREY SOARED AND WHIRLED FLYING AWAY FROM NESTS PERCHED ON TIPS OF ROCK
YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW YOU'LL BE LODGED ABOARD THE NAUTILUS I FOLLOWED CAPTAIN NEMO WHO VIA ONE OF THE DOORS CUT INTO THE LOUNGE'S CANTED CORNERS LED ME BACK DOWN THE SHIP'S GANGWAYS
THE SEA IS OF NO GREAT DEPTH AT THE GRAND BANKS
AT THE VERY OUTSET AND IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS HADN'T HE DECLARED THAT THE SECRET OF HIS LIFE REQUIRED THAT WE BE PERMANENTLY IMPRISONED ON BOARD THE NAUTILUS
EIGHT O'CLOCK HAD JUST STRUCK
THE LIGHT FROM OUR GLASS COILS PRODUCED MAGICAL EFFECTS AT TIMES LINGERING ON THE WRINKLED ROUGHNESS OF SOME NATURAL ARCH OR SOME OVERHANG SUSPENDED LIKE A CHANDELIER WHICH OUR LAMPS FLECKED WITH FIERY SPARKS
I DRESSED QUICKLY
I SAT AND HE BEGAN SPEAKING AS FOLLOWS
HAVE YOU MADE SOME DISCOVERY THAT HAS ESCAPED ME
SIR I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY HOW YOUR NETS CAN FURNISH EXCELLENT FISH FOR YOUR TABLE
NOTHING'S OUT THERE PROFESSOR ARONNAX AND IF THERE IS SOME ANIMAL WHAT CHANCE WOULD WE HAVE OF SPOTTING IT
A WHOLE SERIES OF TOP-SHELL SNAILS--GREENISH YELLOW ONES FISHED UP FROM AMERICAN SEAS OTHERS COLORED REDDISH BROWN THAT PATRONIZE THE WATERS OFF QUEENSLAND THE FORMER COMING FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO AND NOTABLE FOR THEIR OVERLAPPING SHELLS THE LATTER SOME SUN-CARRIER SHELLS FOUND IN THE SOUTHERNMOST SEAS FINALLY AND RAREST OF ALL THE MAGNIFICENT SPURRED-STAR SHELL FROM NEW ZEALAND
THE THERMOMETER MARKED 3 DEGREES CENTIGRADE
FINALLY NOTHING REMAINS BUT THE FIBERS EITHER GELATINOUS OR MADE OF HORN THAT CONSTITUTE YOUR HOUSEHOLD SPONGE WHICH TAKES ON A RUSSET HUE AND IS USED FOR VARIOUS TASKS DEPENDING ON ITS DEGREE OF ELASTICITY PERMEABILITY OR RESISTANCE TO SATURATION
THEN HE SEEMED TO QUESTION ME DIRECTLY WITH A LONG STARE
BENEATH THE UNDULATIONS OF THE BILLOWS THE WINDOWS WERE ENLIVENED BY THE BLUSHING OF THE RISING SUN
HE ALONE REARED IT SO TO SPEAK IN ORDER TO TRANSFER IT ONE DAY TO HIS DEARLY BELOVED MUSEUM
DID IT CALL AT THE CAPES OF SPITZBERGEN OR THE SHORES OF NOVAYA ZEMLYA
THAT'S ALL FINE AND DANDY
THERE THE REMNANTS OF A WHARF AS IF SOME BYGONE PORT HAD LONG AGO HARBORED MERCHANT VESSELS AND TRIPLE-TIERED WAR GALLEYS ON THE SHORES OF SOME LOST OCEAN
WOULD I EVER LEARN THE NATIONALITY OF THIS ECCENTRIC MAN WHO HAD BOASTED OF HAVING NONE
SO YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BE SORRY ABOUT OUR CLIMB CONTINUED
ALWAYS AT INCALCULABLE SPEED
CHAPTER 20 IN LATITUDE 47 DEGREES 24 AND LONGITUDE 17 DEGREES 28 IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS STORM WE WERE THROWN BACK TO THE EAST
YES NED MY FRIEND
BUT WE WERE WARMLY DRESSED IN FURS FOR WHICH SEALS AND AQUATIC BEARS HAD PAID THE PRICE
I WAS ASSAULTED BY NIGHTMARES
MEANWHILE CONTINUOUSLY SWEPT ALONG BY THE NAUTILUS WHERE WE LIVED IN NEAR ISOLATION WE RAISED THE TUAMOTU ISLANDS ON DECEMBER 11 THAT OLD DANGEROUS GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRENCH GLOBAL NAVIGATOR COMMANDER BOUGAINVILLE
I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO THINK WHEN A VOICE SAID TO ME
BUT HE DIDN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND ME AND THE SITUATION GREW RATHER BAFFLING
MOREOVER TO RENEW OUR AIR SUPPLY THE SUBMERSIBLE ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES ONLY AT NIGHT AND RELYING SOLELY ON COMPASS AND LOG IT STEERED BY DEAD RECKONING
AND IF MR NED LAND DID NOT REPENT OF HIS GLUTTONY AT OUR OYSTER FEST IT'S BECAUSE OYSTERS ARE THE ONLY DISH THAT NEVER CAUSES INDIGESTION
VOLUNTARY WATCHES FROM THE CROSSTREES OF THE TOPGALLANT SAIL WERE SELF-IMPOSED BY MORE THAN ONE WHO WOULD HAVE CURSED SUCH TOIL UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES
WHERE ARE WE THE CANADIAN EXCLAIMED
ALL WAS DARKNESS BUT SUCH UTTER DARKNESS THAT AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES MY EYES WERE STILL UNABLE TO CATCH A SINGLE ONE OF THOSE HAZY GLEAMS THAT DRIFT THROUGH EVEN THE BLACKEST NIGHTS
DID IT VISIT SUCH UNCHARTED SEAS AS THE WHITE SEA THE KARA SEA THE GULF OF OB THE LYAKHOV ISLANDS OR THOSE UNKNOWN BEACHES ON THE SIBERIAN COAST
YOU'RE RIGHT PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE TOLD ME
THE FIRST CABLE WAS PUT DOWN DURING THE YEARS 1857-1858
EVEN SO TEN O'CLOCK WAS ABOUT TO STRIKE
CAPTAIN NEMO I SAID THIS IS AN IDEAL EASY-TO-USE WEAPON
YOU NEEDED TO BE FLEMISH LIKE CONSEIL TO ACCEPT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES LIVING IN A HABITAT DESIGNED FOR CETACEANS AND OTHER DENIZENS OF THE DEEP
MY WONDERMENT WAS BOUNDLESS AND IT WENT FROM THE SUBMERSIBLE ITSELF TO THE ENGINEER WHO HAD CREATED IT
WE WENT ALONG A STEEP NARROW PATH THAT RAN OVER THE CLIFF'S SUMMIT
THE POOR SHIP THEN SANK MORE SWIFTLY
HONESTLY SIR I'D RATHER JUMP OVERBOARD
YOU'VE MADE IT TO THE ICE BANK WHICH IS ALREADY FAR ENOUGH BUT YOU WON'T GET ANY FARTHER NEITHER YOUR CAPTAIN NEMO OR HIS NAUTILUS
WE WERE STRETCHED OUT ON THE BACK OF SOME KIND OF UNDERWATER BOAT THAT AS FAR AS I COULD JUDGE BOASTED THE SHAPE OF AN IMMENSE STEEL FISH
A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE FRIGATE'S TWO FUNNELS VOMITED TORRENTS OF BLACK SMOKE AND ITS DECK QUAKED FROM THE TREMBLING OF ITS BOILERS
THEN I BEGAN TO WONDER IF THIS ECCENTRIC INDIVIDUAL WAS EVEN ON BOARD
I VIEWED HIM AS OUTSIDE HUMANITY BEYOND ALL FEELINGS OF COMPASSION THE IMPLACABLE FOE OF HIS FELLOW MAN TOWARD WHOM HE MUST HAVE SWORN AN UNDYING HATE
BUT CAPTAIN NEMO DIDN'T APPEAR
HUGE GLADES OPENED UP SEEMINGLY CLEARED BY THE HAND OF MAN AND I SOMETIMES WONDERED WHETHER SOME RESIDENTS OF THESE UNDERWATER REGIONS WOULD SUDDENLY APPEAR BEFORE ME
IT'S ARMED WITH A STEEL SPUR QUITE EQUAL TO MR LAND'S HARPOON I IMAGINE THE CANADIAN DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
STATIONED ON THE TOP STEPS ONE OF THE SEAMEN UNDID THE BOLTS OF THE HATCH
NED LAND SOON DOZED OFF AND TO MY ASTONISHMENT CONSEIL ALSO FELL INTO A HEAVY SLUMBER
THEN THE HUNT WAS ON AGAIN AND ONCE MORE WOULD BE MARKED BY THE EXPLOITS OF NED AND CONSEIL

IT WAS TIERRA DEL FUEGO THE LAND OF FIRE A NAME GIVEN IT BY EARLY NAVIGATORS AFTER THEY SAW NUMEROUS CURLS OF SMOKE RISING FROM THE NATIVES HUTS
CONSEIL WAS ALREADY TRYING TO LOOSEN THE HARPOONER'S HANDS FROM HIS HALF-SUFFOCATED VICTIM AND I HAD GONE TO JOIN IN THE RESCUE WHEN I WAS ABRUPTLY NAILED TO THE SPOT BY THESE WORDS PRONOUNCED IN FRENCH
I WAS MARVELING AT THIS MAGNIFICENT OCEAN VIEW WHEN CAPTAIN NEMO APPEARED
NO SIR BUT I WISH YOU HAPPY HUNTING THE SKIFF PULLED CLEAR AND CARRIED OFF BY ITS SIX OARS IT HEADED SWIFTLY TOWARD THE DUGONG WHICH BY THEN WAS FLOATING TWO MILES FROM THE NAUTILUS
WITH MY HAND I TRIED TO CURB THE POUNDING OF MY HEART
YOU IF NOT YOUR COMPANIONS WON'T PERHAPS COMPLAIN TOO MUCH ABOUT THE STROKE OF FATE THAT HAS BROUGHT US TOGETHER
HERE WHENEVER HE NEEDED CAPTAIN NEMO CAME TO WITHDRAW THESE MILLIONS TO BALLAST HIS NAUTILUS
BUT IN THIS FLUID SETTING TRAVELED BY THE NAUTILUS OUR ELECTRIC GLOW WAS BEING GENERATED IN THE VERY HEART OF THE WAVES
BUT KEEP GOING BECAUSE YOU FILL ME WITH FASCINATION AS FOR CARTILAGINOUS FISH CONSEIL WENT ON UNFLAPPABLY THEY CONSIST OF ONLY THREE ORDERS GOOD NEWS NED PUT IN
THE DEEPENING MYSTERY OF NEMO'S PAST LIFE AND FUTURE INTENTIONS THE MOUNTING TENSION BETWEEN NEMO AND HOT-TEMPERED HARPOONER NED LAND AND NED'S ONGOING SCHEMES TO ESCAPE FROM THE NAUTILUS
HE DID SO IN THE MOST CORDIAL TERMS AND CONDUCTED HIMSELF LIKE A TRUE GENTLEMAN HE DIDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ELSE NOTHING SIR THE CANADIAN REPLIED
THE FABRIC OF THE JACKET WAS REINFORCED WITH COPPER MAIL THAT SHIELDED THE CHEST PROTECTED IT FROM THE WATER'S PRESSURE AND ALLOWED THE LUNGS TO FUNCTION FREELY
IN MY CAPACITY AS ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE PARIS MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY I HAD BEEN ATTACHED TO THIS EXPEDITION BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT
WHAT SHIP COULD WITHSTAND A COLLISION WITH HIS UNDERWATER MONITOR
AS FOR ZOOPHYTES FOR A FEW MOMENTS I WAS ABLE TO MARVEL AT A WONDERFUL ORANGE-HUED HYDRA FROM THE GENUS GALEOLARIA THAT CLUNG TO THE GLASS OF OUR PORT PANEL
EXAMPLE
EXAMPLE
EXAMPLE
BUT DESPITE OUR NARRATOR'S FINE ACCENT AND STYLISH TURNS OF PHRASE THE GERMAN LANGUAGE MET WITH NO SUCCESS
CONSEQUENTLY IT'S POINTLESS TO ARGUE ABOUT WHAT TACTICS WE SHOULD PURSUE IN SUCH A CASE
BUT WHAT CROWDS OF THEM
BUT UNTIL THEN I BEG YOU TO CONTROL YOUR IMPATIENCE
I STILL COULDN'T MAKE UP MY MIND
THE MAELSTROM
YOUR STATEROOM ADJOINS MINE HE TOLD ME OPENING A DOOR AND MINE LEADS INTO THAT LOUNGE WE'VE JUST LEFT I ENTERED THE CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM
AND VERNE'S MARINE ENGINEERING PROVES ESPECIALLY AUTHORITATIVE
AFTER WE ARRIVE IN HOME WATERS WE CAN DO AS WE SEE FIT
CHIEF AMONG THEM WERE SPECIMENS OF THAT DREADFUL CARTILAGINOUS GENUS THAT'S DIVIDED INTO THREE SUBGENERA NUMBERING AT LEAST THIRTY-TWO SPECIES
BAILLY BELIEVED THAT ATLANTIS WAS LOCATED AT THE NORTH POLE
WE ARRIVED AT THE DINING ROOM WHERE WE FOUND BREAKFAST SERVED
AND IN ESSENCE PROFESSOR NATURE IS HERE MADE MANIFEST BY ALL THREE OF HER KINGDOMS MINERAL VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL
YOU WERE SAYING PROFESSOR HE ASKED ME
NOBODY ON BOARD SEEMED TO BE MAKING ANY PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE
I LIKEWISE MARVELED AT THE NUMEROUS MEDUSAS INCLUDING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEIR BREED THE COMPASS JELLYFISH UNIQUE TO THE FALKLAND SEAS
WHICH IS ENOUGH TO MAKE A FEARSOME MONSTER DOES ANYBODY FISH FOR EM NOWADAYS THE CANADIAN ASKED
WE WALKED BY OURSELVES GENUINE LOITERERS STOPPING OR STRAYING AS OUR FANCIES DICTATED
NO MAN EITHER THE CAPTAIN HAD ADDED
WOULDN'T THAT BE MY RIGHT PERHAPS IT WOULD BE THE RIGHT OF A SAVAGE I REPLIED
BUT IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE CONSUMPTION OF SODIUM NEEDED BY YOUR ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT WOULD BE GREATER THAN THE QUANTITY YOU'D EXTRACT
SIR TODAY IS JUNE 1 1868 OR THE 13TH DAY IN THE MONTH OF PASTURE
A LAUNCH AND WHALEBOAT FROM THE NEW ASTROLABE WERE STEERED TO THIS LOCALITY AND AFTER GOING TO EXHAUSTING LENGTHS THEIR CREWS MANAGED TO DREDGE UP AN ANCHOR WEIGHING 1,800 POUNDS A CAST-IRON EIGHT-POUNDER CANNON A LEAD INGOT AND TWO COPPER SWIVEL GUNS
SLENDER SHEAVES OF CIRRUS CLOUDS WERE FOLLOWED ON THE HORIZON BY LAYERS OF NIMBOCUMULUS
WELL PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED ME WE'RE ACTUALLY IN THAT BAY OF VIGO AND ALL THAT'S LEFT IS FOR YOU TO PROBE THE MYSTERIES OF THE PLACE THE CAPTAIN STOOD UP AND INVITED ME TO FOLLOW HIM
CONSEIL HAD REPAIRED TO HIS CABIN
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER THEY DON'T STRIKE ME AS VERY WICKED THEY'RE CANNIBALS EVEN SO MY BOY A PERSON CAN BE BOTH A CANNIBAL AND A DECENT MAN CONSEIL REPLIED JUST AS A PERSON CAN BE BOTH GLUTTONOUS AND HONORABLE
I WAS UNABLE TO SAY
IT WAS THE CANADIAN ON THIS TOPIC HE WAS NEVER MISTAKEN--WHO SIGHTED A BALEEN WHALE ON THE EASTERN HORIZON
ITS MASTS TREMBLED DOWN TO THEIR BLOCKS AND SWIRLS OF SMOKE COULD BARELY SQUEEZE THROUGH THE NARROW FUNNELS
ANXIOUS TO SEE NED LAND AT WORK COMMANDER FARRAGUT AUTHORIZED HIM TO MAKE HIS WAY ABOARD THE MONROE
THE CRAFT THAT COOK WAS ABOARD CHARGED INTO SOME CORAL ROCK AND IF HIS VESSEL DIDN'T GO DOWN IT WAS THANKS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT A PIECE OF CORAL BROKE OFF IN THE COLLISION AND PLUGGED THE VERY HOLE IT HAD MADE IN THE HULL
LOOK THE CANADIAN EXCLAIMED HIS VOICE FULL OF EXCITEMENT
IT WOULD HAVE THE PROPORTIONS DETERMINED BY THE OFFICERS OF THE SHANNON THE INSTRUMENT NEEDED TO PERFORATE THE SCOTIA AND THE POWER TO PIERCE A STEAMER'S HULL
FAREWELL O SUN HE CALLED
SOMETIMES HE LOOKED UP STARED STRAIGHT AHEAD AND SHOUTED A REQUEST FOR DIRECTIONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY A VOICE THAT WAS GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER
BUT AS YET I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN TENDERED ANY ENLISTMENT OFFERS
AS FOR THEM THEY'RE CRUEL DESTRUCTIVE BEASTS AND THEY DESERVE TO BE EXTERMINATED THE CANADIAN TURNED SWIFTLY AT THESE LAST WORDS
WE'RE HERE TO CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS LET'S CONDUCT THEM IT WON'T TAKE A MINUTE THE CANADIAN REPLIED
FOR SIX MONTHS WE HAD BEEN PRISONERS ABOARD THE NAUTILUS
COULD HEARTLESSLY WATCH IT CHANGE COLOR FROM CINNABAR RED WHEN ALIVE TO PALLID WHITE WHEN DEAD
WELL SIR REPLIED THE CANADIAN WHOSE ENTHUSIASM HAD SUBSIDED IT'S A DREADFUL SIGHT FOR SURE
EVEN IN OUR ERA OF SATELLITE DISHES AND VIDEO GAMES THE SEAS KEEP THEIR SECRETS
HE POSITIVELY AVOIDS ME ALL THE MORE REASON YOU SHOULD GO LOOK HIM UP I'LL CONFER WITH HIM NED WHEN THE CANADIAN ASKED INSISTENTLY
THEY'RE EXTREMELY VALUABLE BECAUSE OF THEIR CARAPACES WHICH ARE COVERED WITH BIG SLABS OF HORN THIN BROWN TRANSPARENT WITH WHITE AND YELLOW MARKINGS
THE FURNACES WERE URGED INTO GREATER ACTIVITY
I ATE VERY LITTLE
REASONABLY ENOUGH IT'S ASSUMED THAT TODAY'S WHALES ARE SMALLER BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO REACH THEIR FULL GROWTH
YOUR QUILL PEN WILL BE WHALEBONE YOUR INK A JUICE SECRETED BY CUTTLEFISH OR SQUID
INDEED IN A FEW MOMENTS THE NAUTILUS HAD SUBMERGED SOME METERS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
WILL IT CANNONADE US AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA TELL ME NED I ASKED CAN YOU MAKE OUT THE NATIONALITY OF THAT CRAFT CREASING HIS BROW LOWERING HIS LIDS AND PUCKERING THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES THE CANADIAN FOCUSED THE FULL POWER OF HIS GAZE ON THE SHIP FOR A SHORT WHILE
AND IN TIME YOU WILL BE TOO
THE NAUTILUS HAS GONE AGROUND AND JUDGING FROM THE WAY IT'S LISTING I DON'T THINK IT'LL PULL THROUGH LIKE THAT FIRST TIME IN THE TORRES STRAIT BUT I ASKED ARE WE AT LEAST BACK ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA WE HAVE NO IDEA CONSEIL REPLIED
MEANWHILE THAT MONSTROUS HERD KEPT COMING CLOSER
IN MY SELFISH PERSONAL INTERESTS COULD I GO BACK ON MY WORD AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RUINING THE FUTURE LIVES OF MY COMPANIONS
TRULY THIS WATER SURROUNDING ME WAS JUST A KIND OF AIR DENSER THAN THE ATMOSPHERE ON LAND BUT ALMOST AS TRANSPARENT
BEAK BLACK HEAD GRAY AND STIPPLED EYES SURROUNDED BY WHITE DOTS BACK WINGS AND TAIL GRAYISH BELLY AND THROAT WHITE FEET RED
BY APRIL 20 WE HAD RISEN TO AN AVERAGE LEVEL OF 1,500 METERS
THE INSTRUMENTS INDICATED THAT IT WAS RUNNING SOUTHWARD AT A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES PER HOUR AND A DEPTH OF 100 METERS
HENCE SUCH AN OYSTER HELD FIFTEEN KILOS OF MEAT AND YOU'D NEED THE STOMACH OF KING GARGANTUA TO EAT A COUPLE DOZEN
IT'S SIMPLY MOVEMENT AND LOVE
HIS EYES WERE SPACED A LITTLE FAR FROM EACH OTHER AND COULD INSTANTLY TAKE IN NEARLY A QUARTER OF THE HORIZON
I CLUNG TO IT
THIS WAS MY DISMISSAL AND I REENTERED MY STATEROOM
MAELSTROM THEY WERE SHOUTING
BUT I WAS RECKONING WITHOUT AN ENCOUNTER THAT SLIGHTLY DELAYED OUR ARRIVAL
SINCE WE WERE NO LONGER VERTICAL THE STARBOARD PICTURES WERE GLUED TO THE TAPESTRIES WHILE THOSE TO PORT HAD THEIR LOWER EDGES HANGING A FOOT AWAY FROM THE WALL
THESE AMERICANS REFUSED TO GIVE UP
NED LAND STAYED AT HIS POST HARPOON IN HAND
THE ENGINEER WAS SUMMONED ONCE AGAIN
AFTER INHALING A FEW BREATHS OF AIR WE WENT BELOW ONCE MORE
WITH YOUR PERMISSION SIR THE HARPOONER ADDED TOMORROW AT DAYBREAK WE'LL HAVE WORDS WITH IT IF IT'S IN A MOOD TO LISTEN TO YOU MR LAND I REPLIED IN A TONE FAR FROM CONVINCED
WE'LL RETURN IN OUR TRACKS AND GO OUT THE SOUTHERN OPENING
AS I SAID COMMANDER FARRAGUT HAD CAREFULLY EQUIPPED HIS SHIP WITH ALL THE GEAR NEEDED TO FISH FOR A GIGANTIC CETACEAN
SPONGES SEA CUCUMBERS JELLYFISH CALLED SEA GOOSEBERRIES THAT WERE ADORNED WITH REDDISH TENDRILS AND GAVE OFF A SUBTLE PHOSPHORESCENCE MEMBERS OF THE GENUS BEROE THAT ARE COMMONLY KNOWN BY THE NAME MELON JELLYFISH AND ARE BATHED IN THE SHIMMER OF THE WHOLE SOLAR SPECTRUM FREE-SWIMMING CRINOIDS ONE METER WIDE THAT REDDENED THE WATERS WITH THEIR CRIMSON HUE TREELIKE BASKET STARS OF THE GREATEST BEAUTY SEA FANS FROM THE GENUS PAVONACEA WITH LONG STEMS NUMEROUS EDIBLE SEA URCHINS OF VARIOUS SPECIES PLUS GREEN SEA ANEMONES WITH A GRAYISH TRUNK AND A BROWN DISK LOST BENEATH THE OLIVE-COLORED TRESSES OF THEIR TENTACLES
LUCKILY I WAS IN A POSITION TO ANSWER HIM
AMONG BONY FISH CONSEIL NOTICED SOME BLACKISH MARLIN THREE METERS LONG WITH A SHARP SWORD JUTTING FROM THE UPPER JAW BRIGHT-COLORED WEEVERS KNOWN IN ARISTOTLE'S DAY AS SEA DRAGONS AND WHOSE DORSAL STINGERS MAKE THEM QUITE DANGEROUS TO PICK UP THEN DOLPHINFISH WITH BROWN BACKS STRIPED IN BLUE AND EDGED IN GOLD HANDSOME DORADOS MOONLIKE OPAHS THAT LOOK LIKE AZURE DISKS BUT WHICH THE SUN'S RAYS TURN INTO SPOTS OF SILVER FINALLY EIGHT-METER SWORDFISH FROM THE GENUS XIPHIAS SWIMMING IN SCHOOLS SPORTING YELLOWISH SICKLE-SHAPED FINS AND SIX-FOOT BROADSWORDS STALWART ANIMALS PLANT EATERS RATHER THAN FISH EATERS OBEYING THE TINIEST SIGNALS FROM THEIR FEMALES LIKE HENPECKED HUSBANDS
TEN OF HIS COMPANIONS FOLLOWED HIM
SO WE RETURNED THROUGH THE FOREST AND WE COMPLETED OUR HARVEST BY MAKING A CLEAN SWEEP OF SOME PALM CABBAGES THAT HAD TO BE PICKED FROM THE CROWNS OF THEIR TREES SOME SMALL BEANS THAT I RECOGNIZED AS THE ABROU OF THE MALAYSIANS AND SOME HIGH-QUALITY YAMS
THEY'RE RIGHT-HANDED WITH ONLY RARE EXCEPTIONS AND WHEN BY CHANCE A SHELL'S SPIRAL IS LEFT-HANDED COLLECTORS WILL PAY ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD FOR IT
CAPTAIN NEMO MADE HIS WAY TO THE HELMSMAN'S SIDE TO OPERATE HIS SUBMERSIBLE AS AN ENGINE OF DESTRUCTION
COME ON NOW ISN'T IT TIME FOR OUR SUDDEN DEPARTURE FROM CAPTAIN NEMO NO NO NED I REPLIED IN A VERY FIRM TONE
THEN IT RETREATED TWO OR THREE MILES LEAVING A PHOSPHORESCENT TRAIL COMPARABLE TO THOSE SWIRLS OF STEAM THAT SHOOT BEHIND THE LOCOMOTIVE OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN
BUT HAVING GONE PAST THE SHALLOWS OF THE STRAIT OF SICILY THE NAUTILUS RESUMED ITS USUAL DEEP-WATER SPEED
THROUGH THE LOUNGE WINDOW I COULD SEE ONLY ITS GRANITE BEDROCK
I DARED NOT HESITATE EVEN IF CAPTAIN NEMO STOOD BEFORE ME
NOT A THING
IN FACT AS NATURALISTS HAVE VENTURED TO OBSERVE DEXTRALITY IS A WELL-KNOWN LAW OF NATURE
WE LOST ALL SELF-CONTROL
IF SUCH IS NOT THE CASE THEN AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITY THIS MONSTER THAT HAS SWALLOWED US WILL RETURN US TO THE WORLD INHABITED BY OUR OWN KIND UNLESS THEY RECRUIT US TO SERVE ON THE CREW CONSEIL SAID AND KEEP US HERE TILL THE MOMENT NED LAND ANSWERED WHEN SOME FRIGATE THAT'S FASTER OR SMARTER THAN THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN CAPTURES THIS DEN OF BUCCANEERS THEN HANGS ALL OF US BY THE NECK FROM THE TIP OF A MAINMAST YARDARM WELL THOUGHT OUT MR LAND I REPLIED
SO SWEAR TO ME THAT YOU'LL ACCEPT OUR SITUATION WITHOUT THROWING A TANTRUM OVER IT I GIVE YOU MY WORD PROFESSOR NED LAND REPLIED IN AN UNENTHUSIASTIC TONE
AT THE CAPTAIN'S SIGNAL WE RETURNED TO THE BANK OF SHELLFISH AND RETRACING OUR STEPS WE WALKED FOR HALF AN HOUR UNTIL WE ENCOUNTERED THE ANCHOR CONNECTING THE SEAFLOOR WITH THE NAUTILUS'S SKIFF
WE PROCEEDED TOWARD IT BUT CAUTIOUSLY BECAUSE THIS SEA COULD HAVE BEEN STREWN WITH REEFS
HIS VIGOROUS NATURE COULDN'T ADAPT TO THIS PROTRACTED IMPRISONMENT
AT 4:17 IN THE AFTERNOON DURING A HIGH TEA FOR PASSENGERS GATHERED IN THE MAIN LOUNGE A COLLISION OCCURRED SCARCELY NOTICEABLE ON THE WHOLE AFFECTING THE SCOTIA'S HULL IN THAT QUARTER A LITTLE ASTERN OF ITS PORT PADDLE WHEEL
I HAD IMAGINED THAT IF IT CAME TO THIS I WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT TO TALK IT OVER
I WATCHED THESE EXPERIMENTS WITH THE MOST INTENSE FASCINATION
MILLIGRAM ROUGHLY 1/28,000 OF AN OUNCE
HE STOOD UP BOWED AND ASKED IF IT SUITED ME TO COME ALONG
THIS ORDER CONSISTS OF FIFTEEN FAMILIES IN OTHER WORDS THREE-QUARTERS OF ALL KNOWN FISH
BUT THE PANELS WERE HERMETICALLY SEALED AND A MANTLE OF SHEET IRON SEPARATED ME FROM THIS OCEAN WITH WHICH I WAS STILL UNFAMILIAR
BENDING FROM THE WAIST HE SHOOK THE CANADIAN BY THE SHOULDERS
I SPOTTED GIGANTIC FURROWS TRAILING OFF INTO THE DISTANT DARKNESS THEIR LENGTH INCALCULABLE
HE TOLD HIMSELF NO
CAPTAIN NEMO WAS STANDING BEFORE ME BUT I ALMOST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM
NOT ONLY WAS HE SICK HE WAS WOUNDED
THEY SAY JULIUS CAESAR GAVE SERVILIA A PEARL WORTH 120,000 FRANCS IN OUR CURRENCY I'VE EVEN HEARD STORIES THE CANADIAN SAID ABOUT SOME LADY IN ANCIENT TIMES WHO DRANK PEARLS IN VINEGAR CLEOPATRA CONSEIL SHOT BACK
THE CHIEF OFFICER WOULD THEN CLIMB ONTO THE PLATFORM AND HIS USUAL PHRASE WOULD RING THROUGH THE SHIP'S INTERIOR
THEREFORE I WROTE AFTER EXAMINING THESE DIFFERENT HYPOTHESES ONE BY ONE WE ARE FORCED EVERY OTHER SUPPOSITION HAVING BEEN REFUTED TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL MARINE ANIMAL
THEN SMALL QUANTITIES OF MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE POTASSIUM CHLORIDE MAGNESIUM BROMIDE SULFATE OF MAGNESIA CALCIUM SULFATE AND CALCIUM CARBONATE
NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE PLATFORM THE SKIFF WAS HALF SET IN THE SHIP'S HULL MAKING A SLIGHT BULGE
NOW THEN IT DID EXIST THIS WAS AN UNDENIABLE FACT
AROUND THE NAUTILUS THE SEA WAS BOILING FURIOUSLY
HONESTLY HE SAID I'M NOT SORRY ABOUT THIS VOYAGE UNDER THE SEAS
ORDINARILY WHEN SOMEONE CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER HE STILL HAS THE OPTION OF RETURNING IN HIS TRACKS
THE NAUTILUS ADOPTED AN AVERAGE SPEED OF TWENTY-SIX MILES PER HOUR THE SPEED OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN
NOW THEN WOULD HE RESORT TO VIOLENCE IN ORDER TO BE RID OF US OR WOULD HE DROP US OFF ONE DAY ON SOME REMOTE COAST
THE HAZY SILHOUETTE OF PELUSIUM WAS OUTLINED THREE MILES TO THE SOUTH
AT OTHER TIMES THEY CAPTURE IT WITH A TENACIOUS GLUE THAT PARALYZES ITS MOVEMENTS
WOULD MASTER CONSEIL SAID TO ME GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND ON PEARL FISHING ON THE FISHING ITSELF I ASKED
IN LONDON THE SHEET-IRON PLATES FOR ITS HULL BY LAIRD'S IN LIVERPOOL ITS PROPELLER BY SCOTT'S IN GLASGOW
I HOPED SO SINCE THE POOR DEVIL HADN'T BEEN UNDER VERY LONG
WE ABSOLUTELY MUST BAG SOME GAME TO PLACATE THIS MAN-EATER OR ONE OF THESE MORNINGS MASTER WON'T FIND ENOUGH PIECES OF HIS MANSERVANT TO SERVE HIM WHILE EXCHANGING THIS CHITCHAT WE ENTERED BENEATH THE DARK CANOPIES OF THE FOREST AND FOR TWO HOURS WE EXPLORED IT IN EVERY DIRECTION
IN AN HOUR WE HAD REACHED THE ISLET
FINALLY THOSE PEARLS FOR WHICH ONE USES STRAINERS PIERCED WITH 900 TO 1,000 HOLES MAKE UP THE SEED PEARLS HOW INGENIOUS CONSEIL SAID TO REDUCE DIVIDING AND CLASSIFYING PEARLS TO A MECHANICAL OPERATION
THE SAME NEGLECT THE SAME SOLITUDE
IT'S IN THIS LAST THAT PRECIOUS CORAL BELONGS AN UNUSUAL SUBSTANCE THAT AT DIFFERENT TIMES HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED IN THE MINERAL VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS
DESPITE HIS INFERIOR FORCES ADMIRAL DE CHATEAU-RENAULT FOUGHT COURAGEOUSLY
THE CONVERGING INSIDE WALLS CHANGED INTO OVERHANGS AND OUR CLIMB INTO A CIRCULAR STROLL
EACH UTENSIL SPOON FORK KNIFE AND PLATE BORE ON ITS REVERSE A LETTER ENCIRCLED BY A LATIN MOTTO AND HERE IS ITS EXACT DUPLICATE
THEY CONSISTED CHIEFLY OF PLANTS SHELLS AND OTHER EXHIBITS FROM THE OCEAN THAT MUST HAVE BEEN CAPTAIN NEMO'S OWN PERSONAL FINDS
IT HAD SEEN THE BALEEN WHALES AND WAS PREPARING TO ATTACK
WITH INEXHAUSTIBLE ZEST THE POPULAR PRESS TOOK POTSHOTS AT FEATURE ARTICLES FROM THE GEOGRAPHIC INSTITUTE OF BRAZIL THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE IN BERLIN THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION IN WASHINGTON D.C AT DISCUSSIONS IN THE INDIAN ARCHIPELAGO IN COSMOS PUBLISHED BY FATHER MOIGNO IN PETERMANN'S MITTHEILUNGEN AND AT SCIENTIFIC CHRONICLES IN THE GREAT FRENCH AND FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS
THIS SPEED WAS MAINTAINED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND ON THE EVENING OF APRIL 9 WE RAISED SOUTH AMERICA'S EASTERNMOST TIP CAPE SãO ROQUE
I MERELY OBSERVED THAT IN THE UPPER LAYERS THE WATER WAS ALWAYS COLDER OVER SHALLOWS THAN IN THE OPEN SEA
YES OPEN SEA
BUT NO DOUBT THESE OTHERS ANSWER PRESSING NEEDS UNIQUE TO THE NAUTILUS
NOW THEN UNLOADING THE INGOTS FROM THOSE GALLEONS AT THE PORT OF VIGO WOULD HAVE BEEN A VIOLATION OF THEIR RIGHTS
CORRECT HE SAID
NED LAND AND CONSEIL WERE OBSERVING THE LUMINOUS WATERS THROUGH THE GAPING PANELS
THE ICE BANK 228 14
THE NEXT DAY JANUARY 5 AFTER ITS DECK PANELING WAS OPENED THE SKIFF WAS WRENCHED FROM ITS SOCKET AND LAUNCHED TO SEA FROM THE TOP OF THE PLATFORM
BEYOND THIS I'LL MENTION THAT SODIUM BATTERIES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO GENERATE THE GREATER ENERGY AND THEIR ELECTRO-MOTOR STRENGTH IS TWICE THAT OF ZINC BATTERIES CAPTAIN I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE EXCELLENCE OF SODIUM UNDER THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH YOU'RE PLACED
ITS TOP PART FORMS A BOX WHERE THE AIR IS REGULATED BY A BELLOWS MECHANISM AND CAN BE RELEASED ONLY AT ITS PROPER TENSION
THEY'RE CLASSIFIED INTO FISH WE EAT AND FISH WE DON'T EAT SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE GLUTTON CONSEIL REPLIED
EXTREMELY WELL MY GALLANT LAD I REPLIED
SALTS HE SAID FILL THE SEA IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES PROFESSOR AND IF YOU REMOVED ALL ITS DISSOLVED SALINE CONTENT YOU'D CREATE A MASS MEASURING 4,500,000 CUBIC LEAGUES WHICH IF IT WERE SPREAD ALL OVER THE GLOBE WOULD FORM A LAYER MORE THAN TEN METERS HIGH
THE BLIZZARD LASTED UNTIL THE NEXT DAY
BUT WHAT PART OF THE GLOBE COULD THIS BE THIS LAND SWALLOWED BY CATACLYSMS
SHARKS DON'T FLIP OVER BEFORE ATTACKING
ALL THE SAME I WAS CONTENT SIMPLY TO PUT THE FRIGATE IN A CONDITION WHERE IT COULD DO ME NO HARM
LITTLE BY LITTLE THE MISTS WERE DISPERSED UNDER THE ACTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS
SEA FANS ISIDIAN POLYPS AND CORAL POLYPS
NOT ANOTHER WORD OUT OF YOU I TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE BATTLESHIP WHICH WAS PUTTING ON STEAM
BUT ALTHOUGH THAT TUNNEL WAS EASY TO DESCEND GOING BACK UP MUST HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE
AS THE ROMAN PLAYWRIGHT SENECA RECOMMENDED WE OPENED THEM RIGHT AT OUR TABLE THEN STUFFED OURSELVES
WAS IT IN MOTION OR STATIONARY ON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN OR SINKING INTO THE DEPTHS
IT WILL STILL CARRY YOU THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE OCEAN'S WONDERS
SOME FIGURES 63 14
I TRIED TO STOP HIM BUT HIS SHOT WENT OFF AND SHATTERED A BRACELET OF AMULETS DANGLING FROM THE ISLANDER'S ARM
IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
ALL THESE HYPOTHESES SEEMED EXTREMELY PLAUSIBLE TO ME AND TO HOPE FOR FREEDOM THROUGH USE OF FORCE YOU HAD TO BE A HARPOONER
STRIPED SHARKS FIVE METERS LONG THE HEAD SQUAT AND WIDER THAN THE BODY THE CAUDAL FIN CURVED THE BACK WITH SEVEN BIG BLACK PARALLEL LINES RUNNING LENGTHWISE
IT'S A GLORIOUS MISSION BUT ALSO A DANGEROUS ONE
THIS RED SEA IS 2,600 KILOMETERS LONG WITH AN AVERAGE WIDTH OF 240
WHAT STRANGE POWER WAS CARRYING US ALONG
MEANWHILE NED LAND LESS DEDICATED TO CONCHOLOGY QUESTIONED ME ABOUT MY INTERVIEW WITH CAPTAIN NEMO
THE OPERATION PROCEEDED APACE
CONSEIL DID SO AND HE WAS QUITE ASTONISHED TO EXPERIENCE NO SENSATION OF EITHER HOT OR COLD
WHAT MECHANICAL FORCE ALLOWED IT TO MOVE ABOUT WITH SUCH PRODIGIOUS SPEED
NOW MAURY SAYS IF BITS OF CORK OR CHAFF OR ANY FLOATING SUBSTANCE BE PUT INTO A BASIN AND A CIRCULAR MOTION BE GIVEN TO THE WATER ALL THE LIGHT SUBSTANCES WILL BE FOUND CROWDING TOGETHER NEAR THE CENTER OF THE POOL WHERE THERE IS THE LEAST MOTION
BUT WHILE THIS GREENERY WAS SPRAWLING UNDER OUR STEPS IT DIDN'T NEGLECT US OVERHEAD
IT'S PLACED IN CONTACT WITH THE WATER AND IT INDICATES THE OUTSIDE PRESSURE ON OUR HULL WHICH IN TURN GIVES ME THE DEPTH AT WHICH MY SUBMERSIBLE IS SITTING AND THESE ARE SOME NEW BREED OF SOUNDING LINE THEY'RE THERMOMETRIC SOUNDING LINES THAT REPORT WATER TEMPERATURES IN THE DIFFERENT STRATA AND THESE OTHER INSTRUMENTS WHOSE FUNCTIONS I CAN'T EVEN GUESS HERE PROFESSOR I NEED TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION CAPTAIN NEMO SAID
THUS PROVIDED FOR I BREATHE AND I SEE CAPTAIN NEMO TO MY EVERY OBJECTION YOU GIVE SUCH CRUSHING ANSWERS I'M AFRAID TO ENTERTAIN A SINGLE DOUBT
TO STARBOARD A PROMINENT BULGE ON THE SEA BOTTOM CAUGHT MY ATTENTION
IN THE MIDST OF THE GENERAL SILENCE A VOICE BECAME AUDIBLE
THEN WE RETURNED TO THE LOCALITY WHERE THE 1863 ACCIDENT HAD TAKEN PLACE
THE SANDY BOTTOM WAS CLEAR AND BRIGHT
NEXT DAY NOVEMBER 10
AS FOR ME I PASSED A HAND OVER MY BROW WHERE BEADS OF COLD SWEAT WERE BUSY FORMING
WHAT THIS FIRE WAS WHAT SUBSTANCES FED IT HOW AND WHY IT KEPT BURNING IN THE LIQUID MASS I COULDN'T SAY
ACCORDINGLY EAT YOUR BREAKFAST LIKE A MAN WHO'LL PROBABLY EAT DINNER ONLY WHEN IT'S EXTREMELY LATE I DID JUSTICE TO THIS MEAL
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME HE CAME OVER
ITS FINE-GRAINED SAND WAS FOLLOWED BY A GENUINE CAUSEWAY OF SMOOTH CRAGS COVERED BY A CARPET OF MOLLUSKS AND ZOOPHYTES
OUR LIGHTING EQUIPMENT WOULD BE USELESS TO US THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED ME
YOU WERE THROWN OVERBOARD AFTER THE FRIGATE'S COLLISION YES PROFESSOR BUT I WAS LUCKIER THAN YOU AND RIGHT AWAY I WAS ABLE TO SET FOOT ON THIS FLOATING ISLET ISLET OR IN OTHER WORDS ON OUR GIGANTIC NARWHALE EXPLAIN YOURSELF NED IT'S JUST THAT I SOON REALIZED WHY MY HARPOON GOT BLUNTED AND COULDN'T PUNCTURE ITS HIDE WHY NED WHY BECAUSE PROFESSOR THIS BEAST IS MADE OF BOILERPLATE STEEL AT THIS POINT IN MY STORY I NEED TO GET A GRIP ON MYSELF RECONSTRUCT EXACTLY WHAT I EXPERIENCED AND MAKE DOUBLY SURE OF EVERYTHING I WRITE
THEN HOW COULD WE TELL WHETHER WE HAD REACHED THE POLE
I EXAMINED IT WITH A COMPLETELY OPEN MIND
LET'S THINK THIS OVER I SAID TO MYSELF AND LET'S TAKE OUR TIME
WE'RE GOING MR NED WHERE THE CAPTAIN'S FANCY TAKES US HIS FANCY THE CANADIAN REPLIED WON'T TAKE US VERY FAR
WHAT WAS FILLING HIM WITH SUCH SADNESS
SO I BEGGED NED TO LET ME THINK ABOUT IT BEFORE TAKING ACTION
CHAPTER 8 THE BAY OF VIGO THE ATLANTIC
THE CANADIAN DREW LIKE A FURNACE GOING FULL BLAST
THE CANADIAN GOT INTO HIS UNDERWATER COSTUME AND WAS READY AS SOON AS HIS FELLOW WORKERS
WAIT AND SEE PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO SAID
SUCH THOUGHTS HADN'T PREVIOUSLY CROSSED MY MIND AND I WAS DETERMINED TO KEEP ON MY GUARD
WITH TYPICAL HUMAN FICKLENESS THEY JUMPED FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER
BUT I KNEW THAT THE SUN'S RAYS EVEN IN THE CLEAREST SEAS COULD REACH NO DEEPER
SO HE SAID TO ME THE CASTAWAYS BUILT A THIRD SHIP ON VANIKORO ISLAND AND TO THIS DAY NOBODY KNOWS WHERE IT WENT AND PERISHED NOBODY KNOWS CAPTAIN NEMO DIDN'T REPLY BUT SIGNALED ME TO FOLLOW HIM TO THE MAIN LOUNGE
AS YOU KNOW AT THE TURN OF THE TIDE THE WATERS CONFINED BETWEEN THE FAROE AND LOFOTEN ISLANDS RUSH OUT WITH IRRESISTIBLE VIOLENCE
CAPTAIN NEMO WENT IN
THEY PITCH CAMP ON TOP MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME LIGHT A FIRE BUILD HOUSES CONSEIL SAID
WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THE CAPTAIN BUT NEITHER DO I SHARE CONSEIL'S VIEWS
I THEN OPEN THE DECK PANELING CAREFULLY CLOSED UNTIL THAT POINT
IN THEIR DARK CREVICES HUGE CRUSTACEANS AIMING THEIR LONG LEGS LIKE HEAVY ARTILLERY WATCHED US WITH UNBLINKING EYES WHILE UNDERFOOT THERE CREPT MILLIPEDES BLOODWORMS ARICIA WORMS AND ANNELID WORMS WHOSE ANTENNAS AND TUBULAR TENTACLES WERE INCREDIBLY LONG
TIME WAS IN ABEYANCE ON THE SHIP'S CLOCKS
HAD IT FLED FROM US
THE NAUTILUS SOMETIMES LYING ON ITS SIDE SOMETIMES STANDING ON END LIKE A MAST ROLLED AND PITCHED FRIGHTFULLY
AND YET THE MARVELOUS POWER OF HIS VISION COULD HAVE PERFORMED YEOMAN SERVICE
SOME OF THESE PEARLS WERE BIGGER THAN A PIGEON EGG
BUT I'VE TAPPED NONE OF THESE LAND-BASED METALS AND I WANTED TO MAKE DEMANDS ONLY ON THE SEA ITSELF FOR THE SOURCES OF MY ELECTRICITY THE SEA ITSELF YES PROFESSOR AND THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE OF SUCH SOURCES
IN THE MORNING I SPOTTED THIS ISLAND'S LOFTY SUMMITS A FEW MILES TO LEEWARD
ON MARCH 22 THE NAUTILUS HAD DIVED UNDER THE OPEN WATERS AT THE POLE
ARE YOU GRASPING ALL THIS NED MY FRIEND ASKED THE SCHOLARLY CONSEIL
WHICH MEANT RETURNING TO FRANCE BY WAY OF THE ANTIPODES
BY TURNING A SWITCH I ESTABLISHED CONTACT BETWEEN THE INDUCTION COIL AND THE GLASS SPIRAL AND THE SEA LIT UP BY OUR FOUR LANTERNS WAS ILLUMINATED FOR A RADIUS OF TWENTY-FIVE METERS
WE SCALED ROCKS THAT CRUMBLED BEHIND US COLLAPSING IN ENORMOUS SECTIONS WITH THE HOLLOW RUMBLE OF AN AVALANCHE
SEARCHING WITH CARE CAPTAIN NEMO SOON FOUND A NARROW OPENING INTO WHICH HE BRAZENLY SLIPPED WELL AWARE HOWEVER THAT IT WOULD CLOSE BEHIND HIM
ON THE VALVES A PEARL STICKS FAST
SO NED LAND HAD GOOD REASON TO WORRY
SEE ANYTHING OUT THERE PROFESSOR NO NED I REPLIED BUT YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE YOUR EYES TAKE A GOOD LOOK NED WENT ON
WHAT WOULD I SAY TO HIM
AND IF YOU'D CARE TO FOLLOW ME WE'LL INSPECT THE NAUTILUS'S STERN IN ESSENCE I WAS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE WHOLE FORWARD PART OF THIS UNDERWATER BOAT AND HERE ARE ITS EXACT SUBDIVISIONS GOING FROM AMIDSHIPS TO ITS SPUR
THEN I HEARD THE HATCHES CLOSE
THIS SCENE LASTED BARELY A FEW SECONDS
BUT OUR CIRCUMSTANCES WERE NO LESS DREADFUL
I FELT--OR AT LEAST I THOUGHT I DID--THE SUBMERSIBLE SINKING TOWARD THE SEA'S LOWER STRATA
ONLY FOUR METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED
AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN NEMO ONE OF HIS MEN STEPPED FORWARD AND A FEW FEET FROM THIS CROSS DETACHED A MATTOCK FROM HIS BELT AND BEGAN TO DIG A HOLE
THERE SOME TEN MEN WERE STANDING BY FOR THE ASSAULT ARMED WITH BOARDING AXES
AND YET FOR THE THREE HOURS I'VE LIVED ON THIS FLOATING ISLAND IT HASN'T SHOWN A SIGN OF LIFE THIS BOAT HASN'T MOVED AT ALL NO PROFESSOR ARONNAX
THIS PROSPECT SEEMED INCREASINGLY PAINFUL TO ME BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH MY BRAIN WAS CLEAR OF ITS OBSESSIONS FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE I WAS FEELING AN ODD SHORT-WINDEDNESS IN MY CHEST
I DESCRIBED OUR NOCTURNAL EXCURSION TO HIM AND SINCE THE PANELS WERE OPEN HE COULD STILL CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THIS SUBMERGED CONTINENT
PUFFERS AND MOONFISH THEY'RE AN INSULT TO A FRYING PAN THE CANADIAN EXCLAIMED
BUT AFTER THINKING IT OVER I REALIZED THAT THESE SO-CALLED CLOUDS WERE CAUSED SIMPLY BY THE CHANGING DENSITIES OF THE LONG GROUND SWELLS AND I EVEN SPOTTED THE FOAMING WHITE CAPS THAT THEIR BREAKING CRESTS WERE PROLIFERATING OVER THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
I REMEMBER IT BECAUSE EVERY MORNING IT WAS REPEATED UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES
AFTER THE WORKS OF ART NATURAL RARITIES PREDOMINATED
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT CAPTAIN NEMO WANTED TO CARRY OUT HIS UNDERWATER PROGRAM AND I HAD NO DOUBT THAT HE INTENDED AFTER DOUBLING CAPE HORN TO RETURN TO THE PACIFIC SOUTH SEAS
A MAN WISE BUT UNLUCKY
WOULD HE WAIT FOR NIGHTFALL AND EXIT THROUGH HIS UNDERWATER PASSAGEWAY IN SECRECY
BY THEN IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK
HEATED BY PERPENDICULAR RAYS FROM THE TROPICAL SUN IT LEAVES THE BAY OF BENGAL CROSSES THE STRAIT OF MALACCA GOES UP THE SHORES OF ASIA AND CURVES INTO THE NORTH PACIFIC AS FAR AS THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS CARRYING ALONG TRUNKS OF CAMPHOR TREES AND OTHER LOCAL ITEMS THE PURE INDIGO OF ITS WARM WATERS SHARPLY CONTRASTING WITH THE OCEAN'S WAVES
SOON WE HAD GONE BELOW THE LIVABLE ZONE WHERE MOST FISH RESIDE
MEANWHILE CAPTAIN NEMO STROLLED FROM ONE END OF THE PLATFORM TO THE OTHER NOT GLANCING AT ME PERHAPS NOT EVEN SEEING ME
DID IT WITHSTAND THE MAELSTROM'S CLUTCHES
THE SEA WAS LIT BY OUR BEACON'S ELECTRIC RAYS
HARDSHELLS BURROWERS CRAYFISH PRAWNS AND GHOST CRABS CONSEIL MENTIONS SOME COMMON SPINY LOBSTERS WHOSE FEMALES SUPPLY A MEAT HIGHLY PRIZED SLIPPER LOBSTERS OR COMMON SHRIMP WATERSIDE GEBIA SHRIMP AND ALL SORTS OF EDIBLE SPECIES BUT HE SAYS NOTHING OF THE CRAYFISH SUBDIVISION THAT INCLUDES THE TRUE LOBSTER BECAUSE SPINY LOBSTERS ARE THE ONLY TYPE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
IT WAS A SHARK OF HUGE SIZE MOVING IN DIAGONALLY EYES ABLAZE JAWS WIDE OPEN
THEN THE NEEDLE STOPPED
THERE THE LAST SLEEP OF THE NAUTILUS'S OCCUPANTS FRIENDS BOUND TOGETHER IN DEATH AS IN LIFE WOULD BE DISTURBED BY NO MONSTER OF THE DEEP
I WENT DOWN A SHORT STAIR LEADING TO THE GROUND FLOOR
OUR SEA ED
NEVER BEFORE HAD I BEEN GIVEN THE CHANCE TO GLIMPSE THESE ANIMALS ALIVE AND AT LARGE IN THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT
THE PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED THAT THE NAUTILUS STAYED AT A CONSTANT DEPTH OF 300 METERS THE COMPASS THAT IT KEPT HEADING SOUTH THE LOG THAT IT WAS TRAVELING AT A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES PER HOUR AN EXCESSIVE SPEED IN SUCH A CRAMPED AREA
I OPENED MY MOUTH WIDE AND MY LUNGS GLUTTED THEMSELVES ON THE FRESH PARTICLES
HE STILL HOPED THAT BEHIND ALL THAT FOG THERE LAY THOSE SHORES HE LONGED FOR
LET'S SIGNAL THEM
YES SIR IT WILL GO TO THE POLE TO THE POLE I EXCLAIMED UNABLE TO KEEP BACK A MOVEMENT OF DISBELIEF
ITS ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT HAD BEEN TURNED OFF AND THE MOTIONLESS PROPELLER LET IT RIDE WITH THE WAVES
BUT NO SOONER HAD I PEERED INTO THE EYEPIECE THAN THE INSTRUMENT WAS SNATCHED FROM MY HANDS
THE ABSOLUTE CALM OF THE WAVES FACILITATED THIS OPERATION
A GREAT RARITY MY GALLANT COMRADE AND ABOVE ALL VERY HARD TO CAPTURE ALIVE
AT PRESENT THEY WERE CACKLING IN CHORUS WITH PARAKEETS OF EVERY COLOR WITH SOLEMN COCKATOOS THAT SEEMED TO BE PONDERING SOME PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM WHILE BRIGHT RED LORIES PASSED BY LIKE PIECES OF BUNTING BORNE ON THE BREEZE IN THE MIDST OF KALAO PARROTS RAUCOUSLY ON THE WING PAPUAN LORIES PAINTED THE SUBTLEST SHADES OF AZURE AND A WHOLE VARIETY OF DELIGHTFUL WINGED CREATURES NONE TERRIBLY EDIBLE
THESE PEOPLE ARE ABOUT AS HOSPITABLE AS THE SAVAGES OF NEW CALEDONIA
I DIDN'T WANT TO RESTRICT MY COMPANIONS FREEDOM IN ANY WAY AND YET I HAD NO DESIRE TO LEAVE CAPTAIN NEMO
THEN HE PRESSED A BUTTON
A DISCIPLE OF SUCH CHARACTER-JUDGING ANATOMISTS AS GRATIOLET OR ENGEL COULD HAVE READ THIS MAN'S FEATURES LIKE AN OPEN BOOK
THAT'S WHY I PROPOSE THAT WE RETURN TO THE SKIFF WHAT
THEN WE ARRIVED AT A CELL LOCATED WITHIN EASY ACCESS OF THE ENGINE ROOM
THE NEXT DAY FEBRUARY 14 I DECIDED TO SPEND A FEW HOURS STUDYING THE FISH OF THIS ISLAND GROUP
AT FIRST I WAS DRAGGED ABOUT TWENTY FEET UNDER
YES FUNNY MAN NED LAND REPLIED
THE SKIFF HANDLED EASILY AND SPED SWIFTLY
THOSE STRANGE SEAMEN ON THE NAUTILUS WERE CONTENT WITH THE OXYGEN CIRCULATING INSIDE
OF THE OTHER MEN ON BOARD I SAW ONLY MY EMOTIONLESS STEWARD WHO SERVED ME WITH HIS USUAL MUTE EFFICIENCY
I HESITATED TO INTERRUPT HIM
THEY ABSORB THE MARINE SALTS THEY ASSIMILATE THE SOLID ELEMENTS IN THE WATER AND SINCE THEY CREATE CORAL AND MADREPORES THEY'RE THE TRUE BUILDERS OF LIMESTONE CONTINENTS
IT MEASURED FOUR TO FIVE MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
WE HAD FOUR HOURS TO OURSELVES BEFORE THE SUN COULD BE PRODUCTIVELY OBSERVED
THESE MOLLUSKS BELONGED TO THE SPECIES KNOWN BY NAME AS OSTREA LAMELLOSA WHOSE MEMBERS ARE QUITE COMMON OFF CORSICA
IF THIS MEASURE PROVED FRUITLESS IT COULD AROUSE THE CAPTAIN'S SUSPICIONS MAKE OUR CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN MORE ARDUOUS AND JEOPARDIZE THE CANADIAN'S PLANS
37 42 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS AT FULL STEAM 43 46 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS AT FULL STEAM 47 52 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS A WHALE OF UNKNOWN SPECIES 53 54 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS MOBILIS IN MOBILI 54 MOBILIS IN MOBILI 53 54 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS 60 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS MOBILIS IN MOBILI 61 62 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS THE TANTRUMS OF NED LAND 62 THE TANTRUMS OF NED LAND 61 64 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS 70 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS THE TANTRUMS OF NED LAND 69 76 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS THE MAN OF THE WATERS 77 78 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS 80 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS 86 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS THE NAUTILUS 87 94 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS EVERYTHING THROUGH ELECTRICITY 93 96 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER
BUT SINCE THEN I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS REVOLUTION AND CAPTAIN NEMO DEPRIVED OF ALL CONTACT WITH THE SHORE WAS HARDLY THE MAN TO KEEP ME INFORMED
YES A HIVE THE CANADIAN REPEATED WITH BEES BUZZING AROUND I WENT CLOSER AND WAS FORCED TO RECOGNIZE THE OBVIOUS
BUT THIS LUMINOUS GLOBE HADN'T BEEN TURNED ON WITHOUT GOOD REASON
HOWEVER EVEN THOUGH ELECTRICITY DOESN'T SUPPLY ME WITH BREATHABLE AIR IT AT LEAST OPERATES THE POWERFUL PUMPS THAT STORE IT UNDER PRESSURE IN SPECIAL TANKS
IT'S AN ODD ANOMALY IN THIS BIZARRE ELEMENT AS ONE WITTY NATURALIST PUTS IT
AS FOR THOSE DAUNTING STROKES OF THE TAIL HITTING OUR SIDES THE SHIP NEVER FELT THEM
CAPTAIN NEMO LEFT THE CAVE AND WE CLIMBED BACK UP THE BANK OF SHELLFISH IN THE MIDST OF THESE CLEAR WATERS NOT YET DISTURBED BY DIVERS AT WORK
I OFTEN STUDIED THE INSTRUMENTS HANGING ON THE LOUNGE WALL
HE WAS EVEN ABOUT TO FIX ITS EXACT POSITION WHEN TWO WATERSPOUTS SHOT OUT OF THIS INEXPLICABLE OBJECT AND SPRANG HISSING INTO THE AIR SOME 150 FEET
MY EYES DARTED TO EVERY POINT OF THE HORIZON
HE DIDN'T SEE ME
YES I SAID 2,000,000 FRANCS AND NO DOUBT ALL IT COST OUR CAPTAIN WAS THE EFFORT TO PICK IT UP HA NED LAND EXCLAIMED
BUT MY DIVING CLOTHES WERE BUILT ALONG SUCH LINES THAT I NEVER SUFFERED FROM THIS PRESSURE
THAT DAY I PURCHASED MY LAST VOLUMES MY LAST PAMPHLETS MY LAST NEWSPAPERS AND EVER SINCE I'VE CHOSEN TO BELIEVE THAT HUMANITY NO LONGER THINKS OR WRITES
NOW THEN THOSE TESTACEA CAPABLE OF PRODUCING PEARLS INCLUDE RAINBOW ABALONE TURBO SNAILS GIANT CLAMS AND SALTWATER SCALLOPS--BRIEFLY ALL THOSE THAT SECRETE MOTHER-OF-PEARL IN OTHER WORDS THAT BLUE AZURE VIOLET OR WHITE SUBSTANCE LINING THE INSIDES OF THEIR VALVES ARE MUSSELS INCLUDED TOO THE CANADIAN ASKED
THAT'S WHY WE AREN'T MOVING AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO RISE TO THE SURFACE AND SLAUGHTER THE VERMIN A DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING CORRECT
JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE LOUNGE NED LAND AND CONSEIL ENTERED
IN THE WATER THEIR IDEAL ELEMENT I MUST SAY THESE ANIMALS SWIM WONDERFULLY THANKS TO THEIR FLEXIBLE BACKBONES NARROW PELVISES CLOSE-CROPPED HAIR AND WEBBED FEET
HUNTING OTTERS IN UNDERWATER FORESTS AS WE DID IN THE FORESTS OF CRESPO ISLAND IS AN ACCEPTABLE ACTIVITY
THERE OUR NETS BROUGHT UP SOME FINE FISH SAMPLES
WE'RE SIMPLY CAPTIVES PRISONERS MASQUERADING UNDER THE NAME GUESTS FOR THE SAKE OF EVERYDAY COURTESY
HOW PAINFULLY THE HOURS PASSED AS I SOMETIMES ENVISIONED MYSELF SAFE ON SHORE WITH MY COMPANIONS OR DESPITE MY BETTER JUDGMENT AS I SOMETIMES WISHED THAT SOME UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD PREVENT NED LAND FROM CARRYING OUT HIS PLANS
I DON'T KNOW IF CONSEIL WAS BUSY WITH THEIR CLASSIFICATION BUT AS FOR ME I LOOKED AT THEIR SILVER BELLIES THEIR FEARSOME MOUTHS BRISTLING WITH TEETH FROM A VIEWPOINT LESS THAN SCIENTIFIC MORE AS A VICTIM THAN AS A PROFESSOR OF NATURAL HISTORY
MEANWHILE THE REDDISH LIGHT GUIDING US HAD EXPANDED AND INFLAMED THE HORIZON
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE VOYAGES FROM WHICH PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS COME BACK AS MASTER WISHES A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER OUR TRUNKS WERE READY
FROM THIS LOCALITY TO THE LESSER ANTILLES THE OCEAN'S GEOLOGIC PROFILE FEATURES A STEEPLY CUT CLIFF SIX KILOMETERS HIGH AND ABREAST OF THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS THERE'S ANOTHER WALL JUST AS IMPOSING
WE RUSHED AFTER HIM
NEAR ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I WAS OVERCOME WITH TREMENDOUS EXHAUSTION
MOREOVER TO FIND A BEARABLE TEMPERATURE THE SHIP HAD ONLY TO SINK JUST A FEW METERS BENEATH THE WAVES
THE NAUTILUS KEPT TO AN EAST-NORTHEASTERLY HEADING A SPEED OF TWELVE MILES PER HOUR AND A DEPTH BETWEEN FIFTY AND SIXTY METERS
YOU COULD FEEL THEM CLINGING TO THE SUBMERSIBLE LIKE HOUNDS ATOP A WILD BOAR IN THE UNDERBRUSH
I COCKED AN EAR AND LISTENED
SIR WE'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET OUT OF THIS JAM
BUT AS FOR ME I'M BOUND AND DETERMINED NOT TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF ANY SUCH MONSTER TILL I'VE DISSECTED IT WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS YET CONSEIL ASKED ME DOESN'T MASTER BELIEVE IN GIGANTIC DEVILFISH YIKES
ITS STERN WAS FLOODED AND THE ESSEX WENT DOWN FAST NED LOOKED AT ME WITH A BANTERING EXPRESSION
THE WORK KEPT ME GOING
DEEP DOWN THE CANADIAN MUST HAVE BEEN OVERJOYED AT NOT HAVING TO CONTEND WITH HIM
BUT IF IT GETS THE URGE TO DIVE I WOULDN'T GIVE $2.00 FOR MY HIDE THE CANADIAN MIGHT HAVE QUOTED A MUCH LOWER PRICE
THIS ANIMAL HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ESCAPE THE TEETH OF THOSE SPERM WHALES
19.3 MILES PER HOUR SIR KEEP STOKING THE FURNACES THE ENGINEER DID SO
I HAD A SENSE OF WHAT HE WAS SUFFERING BECAUSE I ALSO WAS GRIPPED BY HOMESICKNESS
AS FOR ITS HEIGHT NOT EVEN NED LAND WITH HIS GREAT STATURE WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE IT
SO THE NAUTILUS'S CREW COULD DRESS THEMSELVES AT LITTLE COST WITHOUT NEEDING A THING FROM COTTON GROWERS SHEEP OR SILKWORMS ON SHORE
NED LAND AND CONSEIL STOOD NEXT TO ME
HOWEVER I FEEL COMPELLED TO MENTION THAT BREAD AND WINE WERE TOTALLY ABSENT
ON IMPACT IT GAVE OFF A METALLIC SONORITY AND AS INCREDIBLE AS THIS SOUNDS IT SEEMED I SWEAR TO BE MADE OF RIVETED PLATES
HIS JOINING OF THESE TWO SEAS WILL SHORTEN THE ROUTE FROM CADIZ TO THE EAST INDIES BY 9,000 KILOMETERS AND HE'LL SOON CHANGE AFRICA INTO AN IMMENSE ISLAND YES PROFESSOR ARONNAX AND YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE PROUD OF YOUR FELLOW COUNTRYMAN
CAPTAIN NEMO REJOINED US
CRUSTACEANS ARE SUBDIVIDED INTO NINE ORDERS AND THE FIRST OF THESE CONSISTS OF THE DECAPODS IN OTHER WORDS ANIMALS WHOSE HEAD AND THORAX ARE USUALLY FUSED WHOSE CHEEK-AND-MOUTH MECHANISM IS MADE UP OF SEVERAL PAIRS OF APPENDAGES AND WHOSE THORAX HAS FOUR FIVE OR SIX PAIRS OF WALKING LEGS
CROAKERS WITH GOLD CAUDAL FINS
AS YOU KNOW I DO WHATEVER I LIKE WITH MY NAUTILUS YES I DID KNOW THAT
NOTHING OBLIGED ME TO GRANT YOU HOSPITALITY
THE SEA WAS STARTING TO CONGEAL EVERYWHERE
BUT SUCH MEN ARE RARE AND WHEN THE POOR FELLOWS CLIMB BACK ON BOARD THE WATER COMING OUT OF THEIR NOSES AND EARS IS TINTED WITH BLOOD
I STARED AT THE SEA
THE NAUTILUS SLID DOWNWARD ON ITS SLANTING FINS STILL SINKING
DESPITE THE BUZZING IN MY HEAD I SOON COULD HEAR VIBRATIONS UNDER THE NAUTILUS'S HULL
BUT IN THE WATER THEY'RE LIKE MULLET SPINDLE-SHAPED AND PERFECTLY BUILT FOR SPEED I CAN EASILY BELIEVE MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED
SHARKS WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE INDEED CONSEIL SAID
ABOVE AND BELOW THE ICE BANK WAS SUBSIDING IN LONG GRADIENTS
THEN AGAIN WHO KNOWS WHETHER SOME TYRANT CAPTAIN NEMO FINISHED HIS SENTENCE WITH A VEHEMENT GESTURE
A MORBID SLEEP FULL OF HALLUCINATIONS SEIZED MY WHOLE BEING
GO ON I TOLD HIM
I SPUN AROUND
A GELATINOUS SEMIFLUID SUBSTANCE COATED THE FIBROUS TISSUE OF THESE SPONGES AND FROM THIS TISSUE THERE ESCAPED A STEADY TRICKLE OF WATER THAT AFTER CARRYING SUSTENANCE TO EACH CELL WAS BEING EXPELLED BY A CONTRACTING MOVEMENT
SLIM CHANCE BUT HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL IN THE HUMAN BREAST
THE AVENGER
NEVERTHELESS I'M COUNTING ON YOUR DEXTERITY TO CATCH ME ONE OF THESE DELIGHTFUL REPRESENTATIVES OF TROPICAL NATURE I'LL GIVE IT A TRY PROFESSOR THOUGH I'M HANDIER WITH A HARPOON THAN A RIFLE MALAYSIANS WHO DO A BOOMING BUSINESS IN THESE BIRDS WITH THE CHINESE HAVE VARIOUS METHODS FOR CATCHING THEM THAT WE COULDN'T USE
NED AND CONSEIL STOOD UP TO LEAVE
THIS ATTEMPT ALSO FAILED
AMONG MOLLUSKS AND ZOOPHYTES I FOUND IN OUR TRAWL'S MESHES VARIOUS SPECIES OF ALCYONARIAN CORAL SEA URCHINS HAMMER SHELLS SPURRED-STAR SHELLS WENTLETRAP SNAILS HORN SHELLS GLASS SNAILS
LITTLE BY LITTLE THE BUZZING DIED DOWN AND THE DISEMBOWELED HIVE YIELDED SEVERAL POUNDS OF SWEET HONEY
BUT HIS AVOWED INTENTION TO IMPRISON US FOREVER ON HIS SHIP JUSTIFIED OUR EVERY EFFORT
ALREADY NED EXCLAIMED
HIS HAND MOTIONED TOWARD A SPOT WITHIN THE LIQUID MASS AND I LOOKED CAREFULLY
I DON'T MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH BY STARVATION BECAUSE THE NAUTILUS'S PROVISIONS WILL CERTAINLY LAST LONGER THAN WE WILL
NOW WHETHER OR NOT THEIR CROSSING WAS LITERALLY MIRACULOUS THE ISRAELITES DID CROSS THERE IN RETURNING TO THE PROMISED LAND AND THE PHARAOH'S ARMY DID PERISH AT PRECISELY THAT LOCALITY
I'LL LET YOU ASSESS THE DEGREE OF ANGER CONSUMING OUR IMPATIENT NED LAND
MEANWHILE THE NAUTILUS ROSE SLOWLY TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND I WATCHED THE AVENGER'S MURKY SHAPE DISAPPEARING LITTLE BY LITTLE
THEY WERE AS ASTONISHED AS I WAS BUT NO WISER
BUT BACK TO YOU PROFESSOR ARONNAX NED LAND SAID STILL HANGING ON TO HIS IDEAS
SQUID ORDINARY SQUID FROM THE CLASS CEPHALOPODA NO I SAID DEVILFISH OF LARGE DIMENSIONS
FOR A MUSEUM IT TRULY WAS IN WHICH CLEVER HANDS HAD SPARED NO EXPENSE TO AMASS EVERY NATURAL AND ARTISTIC TREASURE DISPLAYING THEM WITH THE HELTER-SKELTER PICTURESQUENESS THAT DISTINGUISHES A PAINTER'S STUDIO
I KEPT HEARING NOISES FROM THE SAVAGES WHO WERE STAMPING ON THE PLATFORM AND LETTING OUT DEAFENING YELLS
WE FOLLOWED HIM
ONLY TWO METERS SEPARATED US FROM THE OPEN SEA
NO NOT OVER IT BUT UNDER IT UNDER IT I EXCLAIMED
WILL MASTER ALLOW ME TO MAKE HIM A RECOMMENDATION CONSEIL ASKED ME
BELOW BECAUSE THE SOMERSAULTING BLOCK SHIFTING LITTLE BY LITTLE HAD FOUND POINTS OF PURCHASE ON BOTH SIDE WALLS AND HAD GOTTEN JAMMED BETWEEN THEM
I HAVEN'T EVEN SPOTTED THE CREW OF THIS BOAT
I'LL ALSO MENTION SOME QUADRANGULAR TRUNKFISH TOPPED BY FOUR LARGE PROTUBERANCES ALONG THE BACK
I HELD UP MY HEAD AGAIN
ITS WATERS SUPPLIED EXCELLENT FISH FOR THE TABLES ON BOARD
A COVEY OF TERNS ALIGHTED ON THE NAUTILUS
BESIDES IT'S UNWISE TO CARRY ELECTRIC LANTERNS UNDER THESE WAVES
NEVERTHELESS CAPTAIN NEMO WENT FROM PASSAGEWAY TO PASSAGEWAY ALWAYS PROCEEDING SOUTH
BUT TELL ME CAPTAIN HOW MANY OYSTERS CAN A BOAT FISH UP IN A WORKDAY ABOUT 40,000 TO 50,000
NOW THEN NATURE HAS GENERALLY OBEYED THIS LAW IN COILING HER SHELLS
OH I DO BELIEVE YOU
NO THE CIVILIZED WORLD WON'T BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR US SUCH WORDS FROM THE LIPS OF THIS EMOTIONLESS FLEMISH BOY SHOWED THAT OUR ENTHUSIASM WAS NEAR THE BOILING POINT
THEN I'LL CONTINUE
THE MUSEUMS IN TRIESTE AND MONTPELLIER HAVE PRESERVED SOME DEVILFISH CARCASSES MEASURING TWO METERS
UNTIL TOMORROW THEN CAPTAIN NEMO WENT BACK ON BOARD
SO KINDLY HEAR ME OUT HE FELL SILENT FOR SOME MOMENTS THEN HE SAID
DAMNATION THE CANADIAN EXCLAIMED
THESE ARISTOCRATS DEEM THEMSELVES THE SONS OF CROCODILES IN OTHER WORDS DESCENDANTS WITH THE MOST EXALTED ORIGINS TO WHICH A HUMAN BEING CAN LAY CLAIM
THE COMPASS WASN'T ENCOURAGING
CONSEIL HAD JUST MADE A CAST OF THE DRAGNET AND HIS GEAR HAD COME BACK UP LOADED WITH A VARIETY OF FAIRLY ORDINARY SEASHELLS WHEN SUDDENLY HE SAW ME PLUNGE MY ARMS SWIFTLY INTO THE NET PULL OUT A SHELLED ANIMAL AND GIVE A CONCHOLOGICAL YELL IN OTHER WORDS THE MOST PIERCING YELL A HUMAN THROAT CAN PRODUCE
TWO MEN WERE SUFFICIENT FOR THIS OPERATION
AS A PRECAUTION THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE STAYED CLOSED BECAUSE THE NAUTILUS'S HULL COULD RUN AFOUL OF SOME SUBMERGED BLOCK OF ICE
IT HAD TO BE A SEA BREEZE LIFE-GIVING AND CHARGED WITH IODINE
CHAPTER 15 AN INVITATION IN WRITING THE NEXT DAY NOVEMBER 9 I WOKE UP ONLY AFTER A LONG TWELVE-HOUR SLUMBER
SO MY POOR NED I CAN ONLY COUNSEL PATIENCE AND CONSEIL REPLIED EVEN MORE THAN PATIENCE RESIGNATION CONSEIL HAD SAID THE TRUE WORD
I ADMIT IT
NEXT THE BALLAST TANKS FILLED WITH WATER THE BOAT SANK AND WAS FITTED INTO ITS SOCKET
I SIMPLY NUDGED MY BIG COPPER HEADPIECE AGAINST CONSEIL'S HEADPIECE
IT'S AN IMMENSE WILDERNESS WHERE A MAN IS NEVER LONELY BECAUSE HE FEELS LIFE ASTIR ON EVERY SIDE
AND LATE IN 1842 HE RETURNED TO 71 DEGREES BUT COULDN'T GET BEYOND IT
AND FINALLY CARRIED AWAY BY ITS SUPREME MOMENTUM IT LUNGED THROUGH AND ONTO THIS FROZEN SURFACE CRUSHING THE ICE BENEATH ITS WEIGHT
THERE LEANING ON ERRATICALLY CUT FOUNDATIONS MONUMENTAL ROCKS SEEMED TO DEFY THE LAWS OF BALANCE
SINCE THE TOPPLING OF THIS ICEBERG THE NAUTILUS HAD RISEN ABOUT 150 FEET BUT IT STILL STAYED AT THE SAME ANGLE TO THE PERPENDICULAR
WHAT ABOUT THE FRIGATE I ASKED
YOU MYSELF CONSEIL REPLIED AND AT MASTER'S COMMAND THAT COLLISION THREW YOU OVERBOARD ALONG WITH ME NOT AT ALL
A SHIP NAMED AFTER THE SEARCH WAS PLACED AT HIS DISPOSAL AND HE DEPARTED ON JANUARY 23 1827 ACCOMPANIED BY A FRENCH DEPUTY
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS HOUSES TOPPLE ROOF TILES PUNCTURE DOORS IRON RAILINGS SNAP IN TWO AND TWENTY-FOUR-POUNDER CANNONS RELOCATE
202 FAREWELL O SUN HE CALLED
AMONG THE ECHINODERMS NOTABLE FOR BEING COVERED WITH SPINES
AFTER AN HOUR'S WALK WE REACHED A GENUINE SAGO PALM FOREST
WELL CAPTAIN I SAID ON BEHALF OF THE BALEEN WHALES THERE'S STILL TIME IT'S POINTLESS TO RUN ANY RISKS PROFESSOR
IT WAS WHITE UNDERNEATH AND REDDISH ON TOP WITH BIG ROUND SPOTS OF DEEP BLUE ENCIRCLED IN BLACK ITS HIDE QUITE SMOOTH AND ENDING IN A DOUBLE-LOBED FIN
HE WORE AN EXPRESSION OF GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
ARE YOU BORED WITH THIS SHIP
TWO HOURS AFTER LEAVING THE NAUTILUS WE HAD CLEARED THE TIMBERLINE AND 100 FEET ABOVE OUR HEADS STOOD THE MOUNTAIN PEAK FORMING A DARK SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE BRILLIANT GLARE THAT CAME FROM ITS FAR SLOPE
IN THE CRAMPED SPACE BETWEEN CAPE BON AND THE STRAIT OF MESSINA THE SEA BOTTOM RISES ALMOST ALL AT ONCE
THE OBSTINATE CANADIAN REFUSED AND I COULD CLEARLY SEE THAT HIS TIGHT-LIPPED MOOD AND HIS BAD TEMPER WERE GROWING BY THE DAY
CONSEIL AND I DID THE SAME BUT NOT WITHOUT HEARING THE CANADIAN TOSS US A SARCASTIC HAPPY HUNTING ON TOP THE SUIT ENDED IN A COLLAR OF THREADED COPPER ONTO WHICH THE METAL HELMET WAS SCREWED
WAS THIS ECCENTRIC MAN ILL
THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN STAYED AT HALF STEAM
YET THERE WERE NO ROLLING MOVEMENTS TO INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF WAVES UNDULATING ABOVE ME
WE'LL DO IT THIS EVENING AT NINE O'CLOCK HE SAID
THIS BOTTOM WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I HAD VISITED DURING MY FIRST EXCURSION UNDER THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN
THIS SHORT BREAK WAS A DELIGHT
AS FOR HIS CHIEF OFFICER THE SAME APPLIED
AROUND THEM RAYS WERE UNDULATING LIKE SHEETS FLAPPING IN THE WIND AND AMONG THESE I SPOTTED MUCH TO MY GLEE A CHINESE RAY YELLOWISH ON ITS TOPSIDE A DAINTY PINK ON ITS BELLY AND ARMED WITH THREE STINGS BEHIND ITS EYES
SOMETIMES I LEAPED OVER A CREVASSE WHOSE DEPTH WOULD HAVE MADE ME RECOIL HAD I BEEN IN THE MIDST OF GLACIERS ON SHORE
APPARENTLY THE TUNNEL HAS NO WAY OUT AT THIS END AND SO SO I SAID OUR MANEUVERS ARE QUITE SIMPLE
THERE IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO OH
CAPTAIN NEMO NO LONGER APPEARED NEITHER IN THE LOUNGE NOR ON THE PLATFORM
AT LAST THESE WORDS ESCAPED HIS LIPS
THERE I FELL TO THINKING ABOUT THE INCIDENTS THAT MARKED OUR EXCURSION OVER THE MANNAR OYSTERBANK
THE EDGE OF ITS LIGHT SWEPT OVER THE SEA IN AN IMMENSE HIGHLY ELONGATED OVAL CONDENSING AT THE CENTER INTO A BLAZING CORE WHOSE UNBEARABLE GLOW DIMINISHED BY DEGREES OUTWARD
MASTER IS READING HIS OWN BOOK MY OWN BOOK INDEED MY HANDS WERE HOLDING MY OWN WORK ON THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS
NOW THEN IF THE CREW OF THIS UNDERWATER BOAT HAVE A PERSONAL INTEREST IN KEEPING THAT SECRET AND IF THEIR PERSONAL INTEREST IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LIVES OF THREE MEN I BELIEVE THAT OUR VERY EXISTENCE IS IN JEOPARDY
WAS HE PERHAPS STILL UNDECIDED
A MAN OF GREAT HEIGHT--OVER SIX ENGLISH FEET--HE WAS POWERFULLY BUILT SERIOUS IN MANNER NOT VERY SOCIABLE SOMETIMES HEADSTRONG AND QUITE ILL-TEMPERED WHEN CROSSED
WE'RE SIMPLY RUNNING AROUND BLINDFOLDED NED LAND WAS JUST PRONOUNCING THESE LAST WORDS WHEN WE WERE SUDDENLY PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS UTTER DARKNESS
WE DIG THE GRAVES THEN ENTRUST THE POLYPS WITH SEALING AWAY OUR DEAD FOR ETERNITY AND WITH A SUDDEN GESTURE THE CAPTAIN HID HIS FACE IN HIS CLENCHED FISTS VAINLY TRYING TO HOLD BACK A SOB
MEANWHILE NED LAND PULLED THE CAPTAIN CLEAR
I FOUND THE WEATHER OVERCAST THE SEA GRAY BUT CALM
SOMETIMES BENDING OVER THE FORECASTLE RAILINGS SOMETIMES LEANING AGAINST THE STERNRAIL I EAGERLY SCOURED THAT COTTON-COLORED WAKE THAT WHITENED THE OCEAN AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE
IT'S A VERY LONG CYLINDER WITH CONICAL ENDS
THEY FORMED DISTINCT MALE-AND-FEMALE GROUPS THE FATHER WATCHING OVER HIS FAMILY THE MOTHER SUCKLING HER LITTLE ONES THE STRONGER YOUNGSTERS EMANCIPATED A FEW PACES AWAY
WHAT'S THIS
WHILE GRAZING THESE ROCKY SLOPES LOST UNDER THE WATERS I STILL SPOTTED SOME SEASHELLS TUBE WORMS LIVELY ANNELID WORMS FROM THE GENUS SPIRORBIS AND CERTAIN STARFISH SPECIMENS
CAPTAIN NEMO REENTERED NEAR MIDNIGHT
WHAT'S MORE I'VE DETECTED THOSE FALLING AND RISING CURRENTS THAT MAKE UP THE OCEAN'S TRUE BREATHING
IT'S SHIFTING
TEN TWENTY FIFTY A HUNDRED I'M UNABLE TO ANSWER YOU MR LAND
BUT ALTHOUGH IT COULD NEITHER SINK NOR SPLIT OPEN IT WAS IN SERIOUS DANGER OF BEING PERMANENTLY ATTACHED TO THESE REEFS AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FINISH OF CAPTAIN NEMO'S SUBMERSIBLE
IN THIS LOCALITY A NUMBER OF SEA TURTLES WERE SLEEPING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
CAPTAIN NEMO INDICATED THE PLACE I WAS TO OCCUPY
GATHERING SPEED LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SHIP NAVIGATED ON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN AND SAFE AND SOUND IT LEFT BEHIND THE DANGEROUS NARROWS OF THE TORRES STRAIT
SUPPOSE ONE DAY SOME VOLCANIC UPHEAVAL RAISES THESE TWO BARRIERS BACK ABOVE THE WAVES THAT'S MOST UNLIKELY CONSEIL IF MASTER WILL ALLOW ME TO FINISH I MEAN THAT IF THIS PHENOMENON OCCURS IT MIGHT PROVE DISTRESSING TO MR DE LESSEPS WHO HAS GONE TO SUCH PAINS TO CUT THROUGH HIS ISTHMUS AGREED BUT I REPEAT CONSEIL
JUST SIDE DISHES DESSERT
SINCE WE'RE DEEP IN THE OCEAN BEING INSIDE THIS BOAT IS VASTLY PREFERABLE TO BEING ABOVE IT OR BELOW IT BUT WE FIX THINGS BY KICKING OUT ALL THE JAILERS GUARDS AND WARDENS NED LAND ADDED
BUT WHEREVER IT'S FROM IT WILL SINK BEFORE NIGHTFALL
I GIVE YOU THE FREEDOM TO ENJOY YOUR PRIVACY CAN'T I HAVE THE SAME FOR MYSELF THIS RECEPTION WAS LESS THAN ENCOURAGING
BEFORE MORE CAREFULLY EXAMINING THE INTERIOR FEATURES OF THIS ENORMOUS CAVERN AND BEFORE DECIDING IF IT WAS THE WORK OF NATURE OR HUMANKIND I WENT OVER TO CAPTAIN NEMO
THESE MONSTERS KEPT PACE IN OUR WATERS WITH SUCH PRECISION THEY SEEMED TO BE STANDING STILL AND I COULD HAVE TRACED THEIR OUTLINES IN MINIATURE ON THE WINDOW
WE HAD FARED 17,000 LEAGUES AND AS NED LAND PUT IT THERE WAS NO END IN SIGHT
YOU'RE UP TO MAXIMUM PRESSURE THE COMMANDER ASKED HIM
ALWAYS THAT SAME FIERCE IMPLACABLE DEFIANCE OF HUMAN SOCIETY
DID MASTER RING FOR ME CONSEIL REPLIED
I SUSPECT THAT MY TWO FINE COMPANIONS WEREN'T QUITE AS CLEARHEADED AS ONE COULD WISH
AND WHAT POWERFUL INHALATIONS
AS I SAID THIS UNDERWATER CRATER SPEWED LAVA BUT NOT FLAMES
BUT WE OURSELVES HADN'T SEVERED ALL TIES WITH HUMANITY
DARK AND DEEP A WIDE GALLERY OPENED AHEAD OF US
OLD LEGENDS EVEN CLAIM THAT THESE CETACEANS LED FISHERMEN TO WITHIN A MERE SEVEN LEAGUES OF THE NORTH POLE
THE OFFICERS ON WATCH RUSHED TO THE CRAFT'S STERN
I GLIMPSED A BLACK MASS DISAPPEARING EASTWARD WHERE ITS RUNNING LIGHTS WERE FADING OUT IN THE DISTANCE
FIRST THEY REMOVE THE LAYERS OF MOTHER-OF-PEARL WHICH ARE KNOWN IN THE INDUSTRY BY THE NAMES LEGITIMATE SILVER BASTARD WHITE OR BASTARD BLACK AND THESE ARE SHIPPED OUT IN CASES WEIGHING 125 TO 150 KILOGRAMS
BUT AT THIS JUNCTURE I HAVE A HUNCH THAT WE'RE STILL LEFT WITH ONE REAL DIFFICULTY WHAT'S THAT SIR WHEN YOU'RE AT A DEPTH OF 1,000 METERS THE NAUTILUS'S PLATING BEARS A PRESSURE OF 100 ATMOSPHERES
THE OUTCOME
THE OUTCOME
THE OUTCOME
WE'RE SAVED HUMPH NED LAND PUT IN HIS TONE DENOTING RESERVATIONS
LIKE MOST FLEMISH PEOPLE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER ON THE CONTRARY MY RESPECT IS DUE YOU
HOW DO YOU RISE BACK TO THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
THE NIGHT WAS STILL DARK
THIS WAS WHAT I SAW AND FELT
NED AND CONSEIL WERE THERE ENRAPTURED WITH THE PLEASURE TRIP GETTING UNDER WAY
I WASN'T SURE HE WOULD SUCCEED
ACCORDINGLY I WAS CONTENT TO REPLY
CHAPTER 12 EVERYTHING THROUGH ELECTRICITY SIR CAPTAIN NEMO SAID SHOWING ME THE INSTRUMENTS HANGING ON THE WALLS OF HIS STATEROOM THESE ARE THE DEVICES NEEDED TO NAVIGATE THE NAUTILUS
ICE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED US AND CLOSED OFF THE HORIZON
MY MIND WAS COMPLETELY WRAPPED UP IN MY MEMORIES OF THE POLE
THIS JELLYLIKE SUBSTANCE DISAPPEARS WHEN THE POLYP DIES EMITTING AMMONIA AS IT ROTS
YOU'RE SAFE ON THIS LAKE AND NOBODY ELSE CAN VISIT ITS WATERS
THE STEWARD WAS CHOKING IN THE GRIP OF THOSE POWERFUL HANDS
I COULD SEE GUEBOROA ISLAND ONLY DIMLY
HE ISN'T A SCIENTIST LIKE MASTER AND HE DOESN'T SHARE OUR ENTHUSIASM FOR THE SEA'S WONDERS
IN MY OPINION WE'LL NEVER AGAIN HAVE SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY NEVER CONSEIL BESIDES MR NEMO REALLY LIVES UP TO HIS LATIN NAME SINCE HE COULDN'T BE LESS IN THE WAY IF HE DIDN'T EXIST TRUE ENOUGH CONSEIL THEREFORE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER I THINK A HAPPY YEAR WOULD BE A YEAR THAT LETS US SEE EVERYTHING EVERYTHING CONSEIL
IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
HERE'S HOPING IT PULLS UP AND SINKS THIS DAMNED NAUTILUS NED MY FRIEND CONSEIL REPLIED WHAT HARM COULD IT DO THE NAUTILUS
AND DUE TO THE PERFECT UNION OF ITS MATERIALS THE SOLIDARITY OF ITS CONSTRUCTION ALLOWS IT TO DEFY THE MOST VIOLENT SEAS
AS FOR MARINE MAMMALS ON PASSING BY THE MOUTH OF THE ADRIATIC SEA I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED TWO OR THREE SPERM WHALES EQUIPPED WITH THE SINGLE DORSAL FIN DENOTING THE GENUS PHYSETER SOME PILOT WHALES FROM THE GENUS GLOBICEPHALUS EXCLUSIVE TO THE MEDITERRANEAN THE FOREPART OF THE HEAD STRIPED WITH SMALL DISTINCT LINES AND ALSO A DOZEN SEALS WITH WHITE BELLIES AND BLACK COATS KNOWN BY THE NAME MONK SEALS AND JUST AS SOLEMN AS IF THEY WERE THREE-METER DOMINICANS
AT FIRST THERE WAS OCEAN EVERYWHERE
CERTAIN AUTHORS HAVE EVEN HELD THAT THE MANY WEEDS STREWN OVER THIS SEA WERE TORN LOOSE FROM THE PRAIRIES OF THAT ANCIENT CONTINENT
LET ME TELL YOU PROFESSOR YOU WON'T REGRET THE TIME YOU SPEND ABOARD MY VESSEL
ITS SPEED STEADILY DECREASES AS IT ADVANCES NORTHWARD AND WE MUST PRAY THAT THIS STEADINESS CONTINUES BECAUSE AS EXPERTS AGREE IF ITS SPEED AND DIRECTION WERE TO CHANGE THE CLIMATES OF EUROPE WOULD UNDERGO DISTURBANCES WHOSE CONSEQUENCES ARE INCALCULABLE
ITS SURFACE AREA TOTALS 1,011.45 SQUARE METERS ITS VOLUME 1,507.2 CUBIC METERS WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO SAYING THAT WHEN IT'S COMPLETELY SUBMERGED IT DISPLACES 1,500 CUBIC METERS OF WATER OR WEIGHS 1,500 METRIC TONS
THERE WERE CONSPICUOUS SIGNS OF A HURRICANE ON THE WAY
THE WATERS SHOOK WITH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MAN-EATER WHICH THRASHED ABOUT WITH INDESCRIBABLE FURY
KINDLY ALLOW ME TO SORT THEM OUT USING THIS WHIMSICAL SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION
THAT THE FAMILY DIBRANCHIATA INCLUDES THREE GENERA THE ARGONAUT THE SQUID AND THE CUTTLEFISH AND THAT THE FAMILY TETRABRANCHIATA CONTAINS ONLY ONE GENUS THE NAUTILUS
BUT I WAS MISTAKEN AND MUCH TO MY SURPRISE HE DID NOTHING OF THE SORT
SARMIENTO WHOSE ELEVATION IS 2,070 METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL
IF WE COULDN'T OBTAIN THEM TOMORROW WE WOULD FINALLY HAVE TO GIVE UP ANY HOPE OF FIXING OUR POSITION
AT THE POLES YOU'LL SEE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PHENOMENON AND THROUGH THIS LAW OF FARSEEING NATURE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY WATER CAN FREEZE ONLY AT THE SURFACE AS THE CAPTAIN WAS FINISHING HIS SENTENCE I SAID TO MYSELF
FORTUNATELY AFTER VIGOROUS MASSAGING BY CONSEIL AND THE CAPTAIN I SAW THE NEARLY DROWNED MAN REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS LITTLE BY LITTLE
EVERY EYE LOOKED TOWARD THE POINT INDICATED
YET IF SOME SAW IT PURELY AS A SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED MORE PRACTICAL PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN AMERICA AND ENGLAND WERE DETERMINED TO PURGE THE OCEAN OF THIS DAUNTING MONSTER TO INSURE THE SAFETY OF TRANSOCEANIC TRAVEL
I HOPE YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN THEM MR NATURALIST THE CANADIAN REPLIED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS WHEN IT COMES TO WHALES YOU CAN BELIEVE ANYTHING
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THE LOG TOLD ME THAT THE NAUTILUS HAD REDUCED SPEED
IT WANTED TO RETREAT BUT THE UNEARTHLY ANIMAL CAME AT US WITH A SPEED DOUBLE OUR OWN
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY WERE BUT BELIEVE YOU ME THEY WON'T EAT ME WITHOUT MY KICKING UP A PROTEST CALM YOURSELF NED MY FRIEND CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY
ITS ABSENCE DISTURBED ME
THIS NEW ROUTE VERY STEEP AND HENCE VERY ARDUOUS QUICKLY TOOK US CLOSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
WHETHER THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS THIRTY-FIVE OR FIFTY YEARS OF AGE I COULD NOT PRECISELY STATE
THE COLD WAS A LITTLE MORE BRISK
THE NAUTILUS'S MEN ATTACHED TO EACH FISH'S TAIL A RING THAT WAS BIG ENOUGH NOT TO HAMPER ITS MOVEMENTS AND TO THIS RING A LONG ROPE WHOSE OTHER END WAS MOORED ON BOARD
MEANWHILE CAPTAIN NEMO HAD CALLED A HALT
SO THE SHIP'S MODE OF VENTILATION WAS FINALLY ESTABLISHED
INDEED FROM THIS MOMENT ON ANY MARITIME CASUALTY WITHOUT AN ESTABLISHED CAUSE WAS CHARGED TO THE MONSTER'S ACCOUNT
MATE MAN THE GUN IN THE BOW OUR FORECASTLE CANNON WAS IMMEDIATELY LOADED AND LEVELED
THIS DONE THE CAPTAIN PRESSED A BUTTON WHOSE WIRING WAS IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE CREW'S QUARTERS
THE ANIMAL KINGDOM BLOSSOMS AND THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM DOESN'T THESE VARIOUS TYPES OF SHRUBBERY WERE AS BIG AS TREES IN THE TEMPERATE ZONES
HANDS OUTSTRETCHED TOWARD THE SEA HE CONTEMPLATED THE PROUD WRECK WITH BLAZING EYES
NED CONSEIL AND I FOUND SEATS IN THE STERN
HE HURLED IT AT THOSE FLESHY MASSES AND RAN THEM CLEAN THROUGH LEAVING BEHIND TWO SQUIRMING ANIMAL HALVES
I INCHED OVER THE CARPET AVOIDING THE TINIEST BUMP WHOSE NOISE MIGHT GIVE ME AWAY
ON APRIL 13 1867 WITH A SMOOTH SEA AND A MODERATE BREEZE THE SCOTIA LAY IN LONGITUDE 15 DEGREES 12 AND LATITUDE 45 DEGREES 37 IT WAS TRAVELING AT A SPEED OF 13.43 KNOTS UNDER THE THRUST OF ITS 1,000-HORSEPOWER ENGINES
THESE WERE NEAR-IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND HE WAS TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF THEM
THEY SWAM WITH QUIVERINGS OF THEIR FOUR LEAFLIKE ARMS LETTING THE OPULENT TRESSES OF THEIR TENTACLES DANGLE IN THE DRIFT
THE ANIMAL DROPPED ELECTROCUTED AND ITS DESCENT BROUGHT IT WITHIN REACH OF OUR ADROIT HUNTER WHO PROMPTLY TOOK POSSESSION OF IT
THE ARMS AND TAILS OF THESE ANIMALS GROW BACK THROUGH REGENERATION AND IN SEVEN YEARS THE TAIL ON BOUGUER'S SQUID HAS SURELY HAD TIME TO SPROUT AGAIN ANYHOW NED SHOT BACK IF IT ISN'T THIS FELLOW MAYBE IT'S ONE OF THOSE INDEED OTHER DEVILFISH HAD APPEARED AT THE STARBOARD WINDOW
AND ALL REMAINING BREATHABLE AIR HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN
WHEN I WANT SOME I'LL JUST COOK IT IN THE GALLEY ON BOARD--IT'LL HAVE A SLIGHTLY TART FLAVOR BUT YOU'LL FIND IT EXCELLENT SO MR NED I SEE THAT THIS BREAD IS ALL WE NEED NOT QUITE PROFESSOR THE CANADIAN REPLIED
NOT ONLY ARE THE SIDE WALLS CLOSING IN BUT THERE AREN'T TEN FEET OF WATER AHEAD OR ASTERN OF THE NAUTILUS
UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS SHIPWRECKS HAD TO BE NUMEROUS
THAT'S NICOLAS FROM CAPE MATAPAN NICKNAMED IL PESCE HE'S WELL KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE CYCLADES ISLANDS
MY FIRST HARPOON MISSED THAT'S ALL
NEARLY STRANGLED THE STEWARD STAGGERED OUT AT A SIGNAL FROM HIS SUPERIOR
BUT IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS HOW CAN YOUR HELMSMAN FOLLOW THE COURSE YOU'VE GIVEN HIM MY HELMSMAN IS STATIONED BEHIND THE WINDOWS OF A PILOTHOUSE WHICH PROTRUDES FROM THE TOPSIDE OF THE NAUTILUS'S HULL AND IS FITTED WITH BICONVEX GLASS IS GLASS CAPABLE OF RESISTING SUCH PRESSURES PERFECTLY CAPABLE
AMONG OTHER FOWL I NOTED SOME SHEATHBILLS FROM THE WADING-BIRD FAMILY THE SIZE OF PIGEONS WHITE IN COLOR THE BEAK SHORT AND CONICAL THE EYES FRAMED BY RED CIRCLES
TO THE NAUTILUS HE SAID
THE WIND WAS BLOWING A STRONG GUST FROM THE EAST
BUT STRONG COPPER BANDS SECURED THEM GIVING THEM NEARLY INFINITE RESISTANCE
IT RALLIED A NUMBER OF SUPPORTERS
MEANWHILE SOME TWENTY OF THE NAUTILUS'S SAILORS--ALL ENERGETIC WELL-BUILT FELLOWS--CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
TIT FOR TAT CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD THE CANADIAN
FROM THE COAST OF ALGIERS TO THE BEACHES OF PROVENCE HOW MANY SHIPS HAVE WRECKED HOW MANY VESSELS HAVE VANISHED
AURES HABENT ET NON AUDIENT NOT ONLY DOES THIS PASSAGEWAY EXIST BUT I'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS
IT WENT ALONG THE 50TH MERIDIAN WITH CONSIDERABLE SPEED
THE SIZE OF A GOOSE WITH SLATE-COLORED BODIES WHITE UNDERSIDES AND LEMON-COLORED NECK BANDS THESE ANIMALS LET THEMSELVES BE STONED TO DEATH WITHOUT MAKING ANY EFFORT TO GET AWAY
TO REACH IT WE HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY UP CEYLON'S WEST COAST
IF WE ACCEPT THE HYPOTHESES OF THE MICROBIOLOGIST EHRENBERG WHO BELIEVES THAT THESE UNDERWATER DEPTHS ARE LIT UP BY PHOSPHORESCENT ORGANISMS--NATURE HAS CERTAINLY SAVED ONE OF HER MOST PRODIGIOUS SIGHTS FOR RESIDENTS OF THE SEA AND I COULD JUDGE FOR MYSELF FROM THE THOUSANDFOLD PLAY OF THE LIGHT
BUT HIS CREWS WERE RUN DOWN FROM THE FEVERS RAGING ON THESE UNSANITARY SHORES AND QUITE ILL HIMSELF HE WAS UNABLE TO WEIGH ANCHOR UNTIL MARCH 17
THE TIPS OF CRESPO ISLAND HAD DISAPPEARED DURING THE NIGHT
SO THE RED SEA WON'T BE OUR WAY BACK TO EUROPE EITHER BUT I DIDN'T SAY WE'D RETURN TO EUROPE WHAT DO YOU FIGURE THEN I FIGURE THAT AFTER VISITING THESE UNUSUAL WATERWAYS OF ARABIA AND EGYPT THE NAUTILUS WILL GO BACK DOWN TO THE INDIAN OCEAN PERHAPS THROUGH MOZAMBIQUE CHANNEL PERHAPS OFF THE MASCARENE ISLANDS AND THEN MAKE FOR THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE AND ONCE WE'RE AT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE THE CANADIAN ASKED WITH TYPICAL PERSISTENCE
ALL THESE INSANE INADMISSIBLE IDEAS DOGGED ME AND IN THIS FRAME OF MIND CONTINUALLY EXCITED BY THE SERIES OF WONDERS PASSING BEFORE MY EYES I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND ON THIS SEA BOTTOM ONE OF THOSE UNDERWATER TOWNS CAPTAIN NEMO DREAMED ABOUT
THE PRISON WAS STILL A PRISON AND ITS PRISONERS STILL PRISONERS
WHILE CRUISING ALONG ONLY A FEW CABLE LENGTHS FROM THE UNDERPINNING OF REAO ISLAND I MARVELED AT THE GIGANTIC PIECE OF WORK ACCOMPLISHED BY THESE MICROSCOPIC LABORERS
JUST THEN CAPTAIN NEMO APPEARED ON THE PLATFORM
EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES
THE LITTLE AIR THAT REMAINED HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN
BUT IN THE 1860S FRANCE HAD TO TREAT THE TSAR AS AN ALLY AND VERNE'S PUBLISHER PIERRE HETZEL PRONOUNCED THE BOOK UNPRINTABLE
IT'S THE FOREST OF CRESPO ISLAND I THOUGHT
THE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL NEWSPAPERS DEALT WITH THE QUESTION CHIEFLY FROM THIS VIEWPOINT
THE SEA WAS PLOWED CONTINUOUSLY BY THE MANY STEAMERS PROVIDING SERVICE BETWEEN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND NEW YORK OR BOSTON AND IT WAS CROSSED NIGHT AND DAY BY LITTLE SCHOONERS ENGAGED IN COASTAL TRADE OVER VARIOUS POINTS ON THE AMERICAN SHORE
MEANWHILE I WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINING THESE UNLEASHED BREAKERS
JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO SNAP UP THE POOR FISHERMAN THE MAN-EATER SAW ITS NEW ADVERSARY REPOSITIONED ITSELF ON ITS BELLY AND HEADED SWIFTLY TOWARD HIM
BUT BEFOREHAND COME INSPECT THE CABIN SET ASIDE FOR YOU
THEY WERE GOLD INGOTS
AND SINCE THE HUMAN MIND DOTES ON OBJECTS OF WONDER YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE WORLDWIDE EXCITEMENT CAUSED BY THIS UNEARTHLY APPARITION
SO HE CHAMPED AT THE BIT IN THE GRIP OF AN INTENSE HOMESICKNESS THAT COULD BE CURED ONLY BY OUR ESCAPE
WHAT HAPPENED I INSTANTLY SAID TO THEM
ITS ENORMOUS MOUTH OCCUPIED A THIRD OF ITS BODY
UNFORTUNATELY I COULDN'T FISH UP THIS WONDERFUL SPECIMEN AND SURELY NO OTHER MEDITERRANEAN ZOOPHYTES WOULD HAVE BEEN OFFERED TO MY GAZE IF ON THE EVENING OF THE 16TH THE NAUTILUS HADN'T SLOWED DOWN IN AN ODD FASHION
CAVORTING AROUND THE NAUTILUS WAS A SCHOOL OF TRIGGERFISH WITH FLAT BODIES GRAINY SKINS ARMED WITH STINGS ON THEIR DORSAL FINS AND WITH FOUR PRICKLY ROWS OF QUILLS QUIVERING ON BOTH SIDES OF THEIR TAILS
AT HIS ORDERS THE CRAFT WAS EASED OFF IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS RAISED FROM ITS ICY BED BY A CHANGE IN ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY
IN THE CENTER OF THIS ROOM STOOD A TABLE RICHLY SPREAD
ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA YOUR CHIEF SENSATION IS THE CONSTANT FEELING OF AN UNDERLYING CHASM AS THE DUTCHMAN JANSEN SO APTLY PUT IT
AMONG THE WORKS OF JOSEPH BERTRAND HIS BOOK ENTITLED THE FOUNDERS OF ASTRONOMY EVEN GAVE ME A DEFINITE DATE
I WAS PERFECTLY ABREAST OF THIS QUESTION WHICH WAS THE BIG NEWS OF THE DAY AND HOW COULD I NOT HAVE BEEN
THEY KEPT GROWING TALLER
IT WAS NAVIGATING AT RANDOM
THE CEILING LIGHTS WERE OFF YET THE LOUNGE WAS STILL BRIGHTLY LIT
IN THE ZOOPHYTE BRANCH CLASS ALCYONARIA ONE FINDS THE ORDER GORGONARIA WHICH CONTAINS THREE GROUPS
SO LEAVE THESE POOR CETACEANS ALONE
MY TWO GALLANT COMPANIONS STOOD PETRIFIED AT THE SIGHT OF THE WONDERS ON DISPLAY
SUDDENLY I FELT A MILD JOLT
HE CHEWED ON IT
BUT I REPEAT
TO BE SPECIFIC THESE WERE SEALS
MY IMAGINATION MAGNIFIED THIS SENSATION
STATIONED IN THE LOUNGE THE CAPTAIN AND I WATCHED THE NEEDLE SWERVING SWIFTLY OVER THE PRESSURE GAUGE
CAN YOU PICTURE I ASKED THEM WHAT THIS FUNNEL MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE WHEN IT WAS FILLED WITH BOILING LAVA AND THE LEVEL OF THAT INCANDESCENT LIQUID ROSE RIGHT TO THE MOUNTAIN'S MOUTH LIKE CAST IRON UP THE INSIDES OF A FURNACE I CAN PICTURE IT PERFECTLY CONSEIL REPLIED
WHEN YOUR PEERS MR LAND DESTROY DECENT HARMLESS CREATURES LIKE THE SOUTHERN RIGHT WHALE OR THE BOWHEAD WHALE THEY COMMIT A REPREHENSIBLE OFFENSE
NOW HE LEFT ME TO MY RESEARCH AND NO LONGER ENTERED THE LOUNGE
BUT THAT'S SIMPLY AN OLIVE SHELL OF THE TENT OLIVE SPECIES GENUS OLIVA ORDER PECTINIBRANCHIA CLASS GASTROPODA BRANCH MOLLUSCA YES YES CONSEIL
BUT COMMANDER FARRAGUT DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE A SINGLE DAY OR EVEN A SINGLE HOUR IN MAKING FOR THOSE SEAS WHERE THE ANIMAL HAD JUST BEEN SIGHTED
IN ESSENCE ITS LIGHT WAS GENERATED IN A VACUUM INSURING BOTH ITS STEADINESS AND INTENSITY
THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WAS CRISSCROSSED BY A FLOATING ARBOR OF MARINE PLANTS BELONGING TO THAT SUPERABUNDANT ALGAE FAMILY THAT NUMBERS MORE THAN 2,000 KNOWN SPECIES
ITS FISHING FINISHED THE NAUTILUS DREW NEARER TO THE COAST
AT A DEPTH OF TEN METERS WE WALKED AMID A SWARM OF SMALL FISH FROM EVERY SPECIES MORE NUMEROUS THAN BIRDS IN THE AIR MORE AGILE TOO
UNLESS HE INTENDED THE RESULTS OF HIS EXPERIMENTS FOR ME
THEIR BRIGHTNESS MIGHT UNEXPECTEDLY ATTRACT CERTAIN DANGEROUS OCCUPANTS OF THESE WATERWAYS AS CAPTAIN NEMO PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS I TURNED TO CONSEIL AND NED LAND
BUT MY DARING COMPANION WAS SUDDENLY TOPPLED BY THE TENTACLES OF A MONSTER HE COULD NOT AVOID
NEAR THEM SOME SEMIPHOSPHORESCENT RED PORGY ROLLED BY A VARIETY OF GILTHEAD THAT THE EGYPTIANS RANKED AMONG THEIR SACRED ANIMALS LAUDING THEM IN RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES WHEN THEIR ARRIVAL IN THE RIVER'S WATERS ANNOUNCED THE FERTILE FLOOD SEASON
LIVING BREATHING JUST AS FEARSOME
THE COMMANDER OF THE NEW ASTROLABE THEN HAD A MONUMENT ERECTED UNDER A TUFT OF MANGROVE IN MEMORY OF THE FAMOUS NAVIGATOR AND HIS COMPANIONS
THEN ENTRUSTED WITH RESTORING THE BALANCE BETWEEN HOT AND COLD TEMPERATURES AND WITH MIXING TROPICAL AND NORTHERN WATERS THE GULF STREAM BEGINS TO PLAY ITS STABILIZING ROLE
FINALLY HE CAME OVER TO ME AND SAID
WAS IT REENTERING THE MOTIONLESS STRATA DEEP IN THE SEA
NEAR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I OBSERVED THAT WE ENCOUNTERED THE ICE BANK'S UNDERBELLY AT A DEPTH OF ONLY FIFTY METERS
BY CONTRAST CAPTAIN NEMO WOULD SEEK THE SEA'S TEMPERATURE BY GOING HIMSELF INTO ITS DEPTHS AND WHEN HE PLACED HIS THERMOMETER IN CONTACT WITH THE VARIOUS LAYERS OF LIQUID HE FOUND THE SOUGHT-FOR DEGREE IMMEDIATELY AND WITH CERTAINTY
I SAW LONG RIBBONS OF FUCUS DRIFTING ABOVE ME SOME GLOBULAR OTHERS TUBULAR
CONSEQUENTLY THEIR GENTLE FEATURES THEIR SENSITIVE EXPRESSIONS EQUAL TO THOSE OF THE LOVELIEST WOMEN THEIR SOFT LIMPID EYES THEIR CHARMING POSES LED THE ANCIENTS TO GLORIFY THEM BY METAMORPHOSING THE MALES INTO SEA GODS AND THE FEMALES INTO MERMAIDS
A BROOK WAS BORN
BUT WE COULDN'T STOP
THE NAUTILUS HAD TO MANEUVER SHREWDLY IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNDERWATER SPIDERWEB
NEVER BEFORE HAS MY NAUTILUS CRUISED SO FAR INTO THESE SOUTHERNMOST SEAS BUT I REPEAT
BUT NIGHT ALREADY FELL FOR THREE OR FOUR HOURS AND LATER IT WOULD CAST SIX MONTHS OF SHADOW OVER THESE CIRCUMPOLAR REGIONS
THE MAN OF THE WATERS 46 11
BUT ON ITS FAR SLOPE IT CROWNED THE RECEDING BOTTOM OF THIS PART OF THE ATLANTIC BY A HEIGHT TWICE THAT
THEY SURVEYED THE SEA WITH SCRUPULOUS CARE
THIS BEAST OFFERS THE ADDED LUXURY OF BEING GOOD TO EAT YES MR LAND
THE HATCH LIDS FELL BACK ONTO THE OUTER PLATING
THERE SILVER-PLATED DINNERWARE GLEAMED UNDER RAYS POURING FROM LIGHT FIXTURES IN THE CEILING WHOSE GLARE WAS SOFTENED AND TEMPERED BY DELICATELY PAINTED DESIGNS
IT WAS THE WATER OF THE RED SEA HURLED TOWARD THE MEDITERRANEAN BY THE TUNNEL'S SLOPE
THEN STEERING HIS NAUTILUS WITH CONSUMMATE DEXTERITY HE SKILLFULLY DODGED THE MASSES OF ICE SOME OF WHICH MEASURED SEVERAL MILES IN LENGTH THEIR HEIGHTS VARYING FROM SEVENTY TO EIGHTY METERS
ALTHOUGH THEY BELONG TO THE CLASS OF CARTILAGINOUS FISH THEY RATE AS A DELICACY
FAR TOO MUCH TRAFFIC FOR THE NAUTILUS TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE ON THE SURFACE
THIS WAS A POSITION ALREADY WELL ALONG IN THESE ANTARCTIC REGIONS
THEY'RE EATEN FRESH DRIED MARINATED OR SALT-PRESERVED AND IN OLDEN TIMES THEY WERE BORNE IN TRIUMPH TO THE TABLE OF THE ROMAN EPICURE LUCULLUS
HE WOULD RISK ANYTHING JUST TO ENTER A TAVERN IN HIS OWN COUNTRY TO BE SURE THE MONOTONY OF LIFE ON BOARD MUST HAVE SEEMED UNBEARABLE TO THE CANADIAN WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FREEDOM AND ACTIVITY
FROM QUEBEC TO THE TUAMOTU ISLANDS FROM PARIS TO THE ANTIPODES DOESN'T IT MEAN
NOT ANOTHER WORD ON ANY OF THIS
BUT THE BARREL SOON POPPED UP ON THE SURFACE AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE ANIMAL'S BODY APPEARED AND ROLLED OVER ON ITS BACK
THEN SEEING THAT NED JUST LET ME TALK WITHOUT SAYING MUCH HIMSELF I PRESSED HIM MORE CLOSELY
BUT MY DAILY STROLLS ON THE PLATFORM WHERE I WAS REVIVED BY THE LIFE-GIVING OCEAN AIR THE SIGHTS IN THE RICH WATERS BEYOND THE LOUNGE WINDOWS THE BOOKS TO BE READ IN THE LIBRARY AND THE COMPOSITION OF MY MEMOIRS TOOK UP ALL MY TIME AND LEFT ME WITHOUT A MOMENT OF WEARINESS OR BOREDOM
WHERE ARE WE IN SIGHT OF LAND
BAH HE SAID
I'M AFRAID I MUST BE FRANK WITH MASTER GOOD FOR YOU I THOUGHT
I WANTED TO ASK HIM
IN THE MARITIME WORLD AND IN THE REALM OF GEOGRAPHIC EXPLORATION WHALES HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE
SMASHED STRANGLED CRUSHED BY THE FEARSOME ARMS OF A DEVILFISH GROUND BETWEEN ITS IRON MANDIBLES THIS FRIEND WOULD NEVER REST WITH HIS COMPANIONS IN THE PLACID WATERS OF THEIR CORAL CEMETERY
BUT THESE SUMMITS COULD HAVE BELONGED TO MOUNTAINS AS HIGH OR EVEN HIGHER THAN THE HIMALAYAS OR MT
THESE ROCKS WERE HUNG WITH HUGE WEEDS IMMENSE SEA TANGLE GIGANTIC FUCUS A GENUINE TRELLIS OF WATER PLANTS FIT FOR A WORLD OF GIANTS
AFTER CROSSING THROUGH A MODERATELY DENSE THICKET WE AGAIN FOUND SOME PLAINS OBSTRUCTED BY BUSHES
THE CEILING LIGHTS WENT OUT SO QUICKLY MY EYES LITERALLY ACHED JUST AS IF WE HAD EXPERIENCED THE OPPOSITE SENSATION OF GOING FROM THE DEEPEST GLOOM TO THE BRIGHTEST SUNLIGHT
THE CREW WERE WAITING IMPATIENTLY FOR ORDERS FROM THEIR LEADER
TODAY TURNED TO STONE TRANSFORMED INTO CARBON FUEL THEY OFFER ME INEXHAUSTIBLE COAL MINES SO CAPTAIN YOUR MEN PRACTICE THE TRADE OF MINERS HERE PRECISELY
IT IS INDEED A RIVER THAT RUNS INDEPENDENTLY THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC ITS WATERS NEVER MIXING WITH THE OCEAN'S WATERS
IT CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF ISLANDS ISLETS AND REEFS AMONG WHICH WE NOTED THE ISLANDS OF VITI LEVU VANUA LEVU AND KADAVU
IN PANAMA THEY MAKE JUST $1.00 PER WEEK
CHORDS FROM THE ORGAN WERE REVERBERATING FAINTLY
THERE SIR
I SAID NO
THE HEAT HAD BECOME UNBEARABLE
ITS STINGS CAN INFLICT DANGEROUS INJURIES
BUT HOW A PIECE OF RED MEAT NO MATTER HOW SMALL CAN FIGURE IN YOUR MENU THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL NOR I SIR CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED ME
I'M UNWILLING TO SAY THAT THERE WAS MUTINY ON BOARD BUT AFTER A REASONABLE PERIOD OF INTRANSIGENCE COMMANDER FARRAGUT LIKE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS BEFORE HIM ASKED FOR A GRACE PERIOD OF JUST THREE DAYS MORE
IT'S EASILY DONE
OUR SUBMERGENCE HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR AN HOUR
IT WILL BE A LONG WHILE BEFORE YOU TIRE OF THE SIGHTS CONSTANTLY BEFORE YOUR EYES
I'M WELL AWARE THAT'S A PRIVILEGE RESERVED FOR MANKIND BUT I DON'T ALLOW SUCH MURDEROUS PASTIMES
SIR I SAID YOU'RE SURELY UNAWARE OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN EUROPE AND AMERICA WITH YOURSELF AS THE SUBJECT
I THOUGHT HE'D CALLED A HALT SO THAT WE COULD TURN AND START BACK
I TESTED IT WITH MY FOOT
SWEPT ALONG BY ITS PROPELLER THE NAUTILUS WAS TRAVELING THROUGH A SHEATH OF FLASHING LIGHT
FOR AN INSTANT I WAS GRIPPED BY DESPAIR
IT WAS A RARE EVENT THAT COULD EXCITE HIM
I QUESTIONED THEM
WE'RE OVERHAULING IT THE CANADIAN WOULD SHOUT
THE FLORIDA SUNDERLAND ENGLAND CHAPTER 19 VANIKORO THIS DREADFUL SIGHT WAS THE FIRST OF A WHOLE SERIES OF MARITIME CATASTROPHES THAT THE NAUTILUS WOULD ENCOUNTER ON ITS RUN
WHERE ARE WE I SAID
ITS COAT CHESTNUT BROWN ABOVE AND SILVER BELOW WOULD HAVE MADE ONE OF THOSE WONDERFUL FUR PIECES SO MUCH IN DEMAND IN THE RUSSIAN AND CHINESE MARKETS
I VOWED NOT TO LET HIM GO BELOW AGAIN WITHOUT AT LEAST SOUNDING HIM OUT ON HIS FUTURE PLANS
GET MY HARPOON NED LAND EXCLAIMED
A HUMAN VOICE HAD ANSWERED US
SO I HAD TO GIVE UP ANY NOTIONS OF QUESTIONING THEM
WE'RE GOING UP THE COAST OF PORTUGAL
WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY EAT AROUND HERE
THE CANADIAN THEN TOLD ME
PERTINENT TO THIS I'LL ASK YOU IF THE NAUTILUS'S RUNNING AFOUL OF THE SCOTIA WHICH CAUSED SUCH A GREAT UPROAR WAS THE RESULT OF AN ACCIDENTAL ENCOUNTER ENTIRELY ACCIDENTAL SIR
WITH HIS POWERFUL HANDS HE SENT ME BUCKLING TO THE GROUND WHILE HIS COMPANION DID THE SAME TO CONSEIL
NO COAL TO RUN OUT OF SINCE ELECTRICITY IS ITS MECHANICAL FORCE
FOR A FEW MOMENTS MORE I OBSERVED THE DYING MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS EBBING LITTLE BY LITTLE
I DON'T KEEP HIM ON BOARD FOR MY PLEASURE
WE REACHED A DEPTH OF 100 METERS BY WHICH POINT WE WERE UNDERGOING A PRESSURE OF TEN ATMOSPHERES
THIS BAY IS FELICITOUSLY LAID OUT FOR THEIR TYPE OF FISHING
HE HAD GOOD GROUNDS FOR AN OUTBURST
IT TOOK SOME TIME TO CALM OUR TROUBLED VISION
AH IT'S YOU PROFESSOR HE SAID TO ME
THE LIBRARY 5 METERS LONG
AH IT'S A CLEVER BOAT YES SIR CLEVER DARING AND INVULNERABLE
THE SHELLFISH MELEAGRINA THAT WOMB FOR PEARLS WHOSE VALVES ARE NEARLY EQUAL IN SIZE HAS THE SHAPE OF A ROUND SHELL WITH THICK WALLS AND A VERY ROUGH EXTERIOR
A GESTURE FROM HIM BROUGHT US TO A HALT AND HOWEVER MUCH I WANTED TO CLEAR THIS WALL I HAD TO STOP
WE WERE FLOATING IN THE MIDST OF GIGANTIC BODIES BLUISH ON THE BACK WHITISH ON THE BELLY AND ALL DEFORMED BY ENORMOUS PROTUBERANCES
BUT THE CREATURE AT ISSUE HERE WAS AN ECHENEIS OSTEOCHARA UNIQUE TO THIS SEA
FROM THIS I FINALLY CONCLUDED THAT IT BELONGED TO THE BRANCH VERTEBRATA CLASS MAMMALIA SUBCLASS MONODELPHIA GROUP PISCIFORMA ORDER CETACEA FAMILY BUT HERE I COULDN'T MAKE UP MY MIND
NO MAMMAL EXCEPT MAN HAS MORE ABUNDANT CEREBRAL MATTER
THE POWER OF OUR BEACON WAS INCREASED A HUNDREDFOLD LIKE A LAMP SHINING THROUGH THE BICONVEX LENSES OF A WORLD-CLASS LIGHTHOUSE
BUT THE WEAKNESS OF ITS SLOPE BETWEEN ITS STARTING POINT NEAR BUBASTIS AND THE RED SEA LEFT IT NAVIGABLE ONLY A FEW MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR
MY PROFESSORIAL GLEE MAY EASILY BE IMAGINED
THE WATER WAS RISING
CONSEIL AND LAND SPENT THE LONG HOURS WITH ME
I STRAIGHTENED SUDDENLY
I STRAIGHTENED SUDDENLY
IT WAS BARELY ABLE TO WALK
BUT I ENLIGHTENED THE FINE LAD AND LET HIM DOWN GENTLY BY GIVING HIM VARIOUS DETAILS ON THE LAYING OF THIS CABLE
NOT ONE OF THEM HAD COME UP TO ENJOY THE OPEN AIR
IN NEW YORK ETC
GIVEN THIS NO ONE WILL BE ASTONISHED AT THE UPROAR PROVOKED BY THIS ACCIDENT INVOLVING ONE OF ITS FINEST STEAMERS
I WAS MISTAKEN
I WAS MISTAKEN
IT BLINDED US
A ONE-METER JACK WITH A PROMINENT HEAD SEVERAL FINE BONITO FROM THE GENUS SCOMBER DECKED OUT IN THE COLORS BLUE AND SILVER AND THREE MAGNIFICENT TUNA WHOSE HIGH SPEEDS COULDN'T SAVE THEM FROM OUR TRAWL
AND IF IT HAS THEIR POWER TO ELECTROCUTE IT'S SURELY THE MOST DREADFUL ANIMAL EVER CONCEIVED BY OUR CREATOR
HIS FOUR COMPANIONS LEANED INTO THEIR OARS
CAPTAIN NEMO SHOWED ME TO A BENCH
BE THAT AS IT MAY BY THE NEXT DAY THE NAUTILUS HAD LEFT ITS HOME PORT AND WAS NAVIGATING WELL OUT FROM ANY SHORE A FEW METERS BENEATH THE WAVES OF THE ATLANTIC
BRANDISHED IN ITS CAPTAIN'S HANDS THE NAUTILUS WAS SIMPLY A FEARSOME HARPOON
THREE HOLES PROTECTED BY HEAVY GLASS ALLOWED US TO SEE IN ANY DIRECTION WITH SIMPLY A TURN OF THE HEAD INSIDE THE SPHERE
GO BELOW THE CANADIAN CONSEIL AND I COULD ONLY OBEY
AND WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE THAT AS A LAST RESORT IF THE NAUTILUS DOESN'T RIGHT ITSELF WHICH I'D REGARD AS A REAL CALAMITY BUT COULDN'T WE AT LEAST GET THE LAY OF THE LAND NED WENT ON
ON THE 23RD OF THAT SAME MONTH HE REACHED THE 74TH PARALLEL A POSITION DENOTING THE FARTHEST SOUTH ATTAINED UNTIL THEN
THEN THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE CLOSED
IT WAS ALMOST NOON
I NOTED THE SLIGHT OVERLAP OF ITS SHEET-IRON PLATES WHICH RESEMBLED THE SCALES COVERING THE BODIES OF OUR BIG LAND REPTILES
IT SEEMED OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THIS MAN DIDN'T UNDERSTAND FRENCH BECAUSE I MADE SEVERAL REMARKS IN A LOUD VOICE THAT WERE BOUND TO PROVOKE HIM TO SOME INVOLUNTARY SHOW OF INTEREST HAD HE UNDERSTOOD THEM
I COULDN'T TELL
MURKY AS WELL AND VERY RICH IN SALINE MATERIAL THEIR PURE INDIGO CONTRASTS WITH THE GREEN WAVES SURROUNDING THEM
WHEN EVEN THE PAINTER'S BRUSH CAN'T DEPICT THE EFFECTS UNIQUE TO THE LIQUID ELEMENT HOW CAN THE WRITER'S PEN HOPE TO REPRODUCE THEM
HENCE THE NEED FOR SOME OPENING THAT PUT THE BOAT'S INTERIOR IN CONTACT WITH THE ATMOSPHERE
DO YOU WANT TO BE NAILED TO THE NAUTILUS'S SPUR BEFORE IT CHARGES THAT SHIP DREADFUL TO HEAR CAPTAIN NEMO WAS EVEN MORE DREADFUL TO SEE
HE STOOD STILL REVIVING ONLY WHEN HIS PILOT'S INSTINCTS TOOK OVER
THEN HE BRISKLY UNDRESSED ME WHILE I SWAM FOR US BOTH
BUT GIVING UP THAT INTOLERABLE EARTHLY YOKE THAT SOME MEN CALL FREEDOM IS PERHAPS LESS PAINFUL THAN YOU THINK BY THUNDER NED LAND SHOUTED
ALL DAY LONG I WAS AQUIVER WITH GRUESOME FOREBODINGS
BESIDES I USE MY SUPPLEMENTARY BALLAST TANKS ONLY TO REACH AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF 1,500 TO 2,000 METERS AND THAT WITH A VIEW TO CONSERVING MY MACHINERY
PROFESSOR WHEN I PROPOSED THAT YOU GO HUNTING IN MY CRESPO FORESTS YOU THOUGHT I WAS CONTRADICTING MYSELF
I WAITED FOR CAPTAIN NEMO
SO LONG AS IT NAVIGATES HORIZONTALLY NED LAND MUTTERED I'VE NO COMPLAINTS
HAD HIS COMPANIONS DIED WITH HIM
THE NAUTILUS WAS BUILT TO REST ON THE OCEAN FLOOR AND I DON'T NEED TO UNDERTAKE THE ARDUOUS LABORS THE MANEUVERS D'URVILLE HAD TO ATTEMPT IN ORDER TO FLOAT OFF HIS SLOOPS OF WAR
BUT ONE OF THEM THE CAPTAIN OF THE MONROE KNEW THAT NED LAND HAD SHIPPED ABOARD THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND ASKED HIS HELP IN HUNTING A BALEEN WHALE THAT WAS IN SIGHT
THE EARTH DOESN'T NEED NEW CONTINENTS BUT NEW MEN SAILORS LUCK LED THE NAUTILUS STRAIGHT TO REAO ISLAND ONE OF THE MOST UNUSUAL IN THIS GROUP WHICH WAS DISCOVERED IN 1822 BY CAPTAIN BELL ABOARD THE MINERVA
YES HE LOVED HIS SHIP THE SAME WAY A FATHER LOVES HIS CHILD
SO IT WAS IMPERATIVE TO MAKE CONTACT WITH WHATEVER BEINGS WERE CONFINED INSIDE THE PLATING OF THIS MACHINE
IT WAS THE DUTCH NAVIGATOR TASMAN WHO DISCOVERED THIS GROUP IN 1643 THE SAME YEAR THE ITALIAN PHYSICIST TORRICELLI INVENTED THE BAROMETER AND KING LOUIS XIV ASCENDED THE FRENCH THRONE
HIS HEART STILL THROBBED FOR SUFFERING HUMANITY AND HIS IMMENSE PHILANTHROPY WENT OUT BOTH TO DOWNTRODDEN RACES AND TO INDIVIDUALS
I STAYED THERE AN HOUR BASKING IN THE AURA OF THE CEILING LIGHTS PASSING IN REVIEW THE TREASURES SHINING IN THEIR GLASS CASES
LUCK PLUS LOGIC PROFESSOR AND LOGIC EVEN MORE THAN LUCK CAPTAIN I HEAR YOU BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE MY EARS OH SIR
IT WILL AT LEAST CONVEY THE QUICKNESS OF MY OBSERVATIONS
GIVEN THE WAY THE NAUTILUS WAS NAVIGATING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHEER INSANITY TO THINK OF ESCAPING NED LAND DIDN'T REPLY
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER WE WERE BREATHING FRESH AIR ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
BESIDES AN ESCAPE ATTEMPT MIGHT BE TIMELY IF WE WERE IN SIGHT OF THE COASTS OF ENGLAND OR PROVENCE BUT IN THE WATERWAYS OF PAPUA IT'S ANOTHER STORY
FROM ITS MASS OF GREENERY HUGE GLOBULAR FRUIT STOOD OUT A DECIMETER WIDE AND FURNISHED ON THE OUTSIDE WITH CREASES THAT ASSUMED A HEXANGULAR PATTERN
HELPED BY THE WATER MY MOVEMENTS WERE EXECUTED WITH STARTLING EASE
ON NOVEMBER 26 AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE NAUTILUS CLEARED THE TROPIC OF CANCER AT LONGITUDE 172 DEGREES
THE OPEN WATERS AT THE SHORELINE WERE ALIVE WITH THESE DELIGHTFUL PTEROPODS TRUE BUTTERFLIES OF THE SEA
I REALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED
UNDER THE GREEN SHADE OF SOME TROPICAL EVERGREENS I SPOTTED A FEW SAVAGES WHO LOOKED EXTREMELY STARTLED AT OUR APPROACH
THE VESSEL LAY A MILE AND A HALF OFF AND WITH THE FIRST GLIMMERS OF DAYLIGHT IT RESUMED ITS CANNONADE
OH THE RASCAL CONSEIL EXCLAIMED
DORADOS FROM THE GENUS SPARUS SOME MEASURING UP TO THIRTEEN DECIMETERS APPEARED IN SILVER AND AZURE COSTUMES ENCIRCLED WITH RIBBONS WHICH CONTRASTED WITH THE DARK COLOR OF THEIR FINS
WHAT A STRUGGLE
THE LONG SNAKE WAS COVERED WITH SEASHELL RUBBLE AND BRISTLING WITH FORAMINIFERA
I ATE SUPPER FEASTING WITH APPETITE ON AN EXCELLENT PIECE OF SEAL LIVER WHOSE FLAVOR REMINDED ME OF PORK
LET'S GO LET'S GO I EXCLAIMED
I COULDN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF THESE MARINE WONDERS WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY JOLTED BY AN UNEXPECTED APPARITION
NO CREWMEN
THERE YOU GO AGAIN CONSEIL MY FRIEND THE IMPATIENT CANADIAN SHOT BACK
OBVIOUSLY SOME SLEEP-INDUCING SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN LACED INTO THE FOOD WE'D JUST EATEN
IT WAS LOCATED BETWEEN LATITUDE 5 DEGREES 55 AND 9 DEGREES 49 NORTH AND BETWEEN LONGITUDE 79 DEGREES 42 AND 82 DEGREES 4 EAST OF THE MERIDIAN OF GREENWICH
TALL BLACK-ROSEWOOD BOOKCASES INLAID WITH COPPERWORK HELD ON THEIR WIDE SHELVES A LARGE NUMBER OF UNIFORMLY BOUND BOOKS
FOUR INCISORS IN BOTH THE UPPER AND LOWER PLUS TWO BIG CANINES SHAPED LIKE THE FLEUR-DE-LIS
AMONG OTHER THINGS WE CAME TO TALK OF THE NAUTILUS'S CIRCUMSTANCES AGROUND IN THE SAME STRAIT WHERE CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE HAD NEARLY MISCARRIED
WHAT DID WE DO THAT'S SO PRAISEWORTHY
AT THIS ORDER WHICH WAS RELAYED TO THE ENGINE BY MEANS OF A COMPRESSED-AIR DEVICE THE MECHANICS ACTIVATED THE START-UP WHEEL
WILL ANYONE BELIEVE ME
BUT SINCE YOU SEEM TO HAVE MADE A SPECIAL STUDY OF THIS SEA CAPTAIN CAN YOU TELL ME HOW IT GOT ITS NAME MANY EXPLANATIONS EXIST ON THE SUBJECT PROFESSOR ARONNAX
NOT A SAIL ON THE HORIZON
AND WE FOUND NOTHING
LEANING HIS ELBOW ON THE CORNER OF A VALUABLE MOSAIC TABLE HE NO LONGER SAW ME HE HAD FORGOTTEN MY VERY PRESENCE
AND HOW MANY TIMES I SHARED THE EXCITEMENT OF GENERAL STAFF AND CREW WHEN SOME UNPREDICTABLE WHALE LIFTED ITS BLACKISH BACK ABOVE THE WAVES
WE COULDN'T COMPLAIN AND MOREOVER THE VERY UNIQUENESS OF OUR SITUATION HAD SUCH GENEROUS REWARDS IN STORE FOR US WE HAD NO GROUNDS FOR CRITICISM
UNDER MY EYES THERE PERHAPS LAY THE WARLIKE TOWN OF MAKHIMOS OR THE PIOUS VILLAGE OF EUSEBES WHOSE GIGANTIC INHABITANTS LIVED FOR WHOLE CENTURIES AND HAD THE STRENGTH TO RAISE BLOCKS OF STONE THAT STILL WITHSTOOD THE ACTION OF THE WATERS
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS I EXCLAIMED
THE CANADIAN'S SIGNAL HADN'T REACHED ME
ORIGINALLY THIS SHIP WAS CHRISTENED THE MARSEILLAIS
THIS BOAT IS A MASTERPIECE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY AND I'D BE SORRY TO HAVE MISSED IT
WHEN IT PLIED MORE HEAVILY TRAVELED SEAS WE OFTEN SAW WRECKED HULLS ROTTING IN MIDWATER AND FARTHER DOWN CANNONS SHELLS ANCHORS CHAINS AND A THOUSAND OTHER IRON OBJECTS RUSTING AWAY
THEN FORDING SOME STREAM BEDS HE REACHED OPEN PLAINS THAT WERE BORDERED BY WONDERFUL FORESTS
NOT A SINGLE SHIP ENCOUNTERED IT
I NEVER TOUCH THE FLESH OF LAND ANIMALS NEVERTHELESS THIS I WENT ON POINTING TO A DISH WHERE SOME SLICES OF LOIN WERE STILL LEFT
NOW THEN SINCE AN ENGINE IS NEEDED TO GENERATE THAT SPEED AND A MECHANIC TO RUN THAT ENGINE I CONCLUDE
USUALLY WHAT GAMBLERS REGRET THE MOST ISN'T THE LOSS OF THEIR MONEY SO MUCH AS THE LOSS OF THEIR INSANE HOPES
SOME GIGANTIC DEVILFISH MAYBE EVEN LESS LIKELY NED
I BOTH DESIRED AND DREADED IT
I WAS STRETCHED OUT ON THE SEAFLOOR DIRECTLY BENEATH SOME BUSHES OF ALGAE WHEN I RAISED MY HEAD AND SPIED TWO ENORMOUS MASSES HURTLING BY THROWING OFF PHOSPHORESCENT GLIMMERS
DANIELE MANIN THE ITALIAN PATRIOT
THERE AS YONDER MYRIADS OF BIRDS ENLIVENED THIS PART OF THE POLAR CONTINENT
HERDS OF THESE DIFFERENT MAMMALS WERE PLAYING ABOUT IN THE TRANQUIL WATERS AND I COULD EASILY SEE THAT THIS ANTARCTIC POLAR BASIN NOW SERVED AS A REFUGE FOR THOSE CETACEANS TOO RELENTLESSLY PURSUED BY HUNTERS
AS FOR RELEGATING IT TO THE REALM OF FICTION THAT CHARGE HAD TO BE DROPPED
A FRIEND OF MINE CAPTAIN PAUL BOS OF LE HAVRE HAS OFTEN SWORN TO ME THAT HE ENCOUNTERED ONE OF THESE MONSTERS OF COLOSSAL SIZE IN THE SEAS OF THE EAST INDIES
THE NAUTILUS CRUISED ALONG A SHORT DISTANCE OFF THE SHORE OF THIS DESERT ISLAND
BUT THERE ARE STORIES OF GIGANTIC SPERM WHALES
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL TOLD ME WE'LL PASS IT BY I FULLY EXPECT TO I REPLIED IN A TONE OF DEEP CONVICTION
SMALL ONE-METER SHARKS WITH GRAY AND WHITISH HIDES THEIR TEETH ARRANGED IN SEVERAL BACKWARD-CURVING ROWS FISH COMMONLY KNOWN BY THE NAME CARPET SHARK
CAPTAIN NEMO WAS ALREADY THERE
WHAT AN EXPERIENCE I EXCLAIMED
AFTER DETERMINING THE NAUTILUS'S HEADING I NOTED THAT IT WAS PROCEEDING TOWARD THE ANCIENT ISLAND OF CRETE ALSO CALLED CANDIA
LIVE IN THE HEART OF THE SEAS
THEN I HEARD THEM HOIST IT UP THE IRON COMPANIONWAY BY MEANS OF PULLEYS
ONE OF THE STEEL PLATES FLEW UP A MAN APPEARED GAVE A BIZARRE YELL AND INSTANTLY DISAPPEARED
BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME ANXIETIES
BETWEEN US AND THE SHORE THE SEA WAS DESERTED
BRANDISHING AN IMAGINARY HARPOON HIS HANDS POSITIVELY TREMBLED
MY FRIENDS I REPLIED VERY MOVED WE'RE BOUND TO EACH OTHER FOREVER AND I'M DEEPLY INDEBTED TO YOU WHICH I'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CANADIAN SHOT BACK
AFTER LIKEWISE CLOSING THE OPENING IN THE SKIFF THE CANADIAN BEGAN TO UNSCREW THE NUTS STILL BOLTING US TO THE UNDERWATER BOAT
WE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY OF FEBRUARY 22 IN THE SARGASSO SEA WHERE FISH THAT DOTE ON MARINE PLANTS AND CRUSTACEANS FIND PLENTY TO EAT
THIS MAN DOESN'T UNDERSTAND FRENCH I TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE WOUNDED MAN THEN I REPLIED
HOW STARTLED HE MUST HAVE FELT HOW FRIGHTENED EVEN AT SEEING FOUR HUGE COPPER CRANIUMS LEANING OVER HIM
I DID WISH TO RUN THIS RISK
AS FOR YOU PROFESSOR ARONNAX YOU'LL STAY IN THE LIBRARY TWO STEPS AWAY AND WAIT FOR MY SIGNAL
COULD THERE BE A FIRE ON BOARD I WONDERED
244 THE POOR FELLOW WAS DONE FOR
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME WHAT A FUTILE EXPENSE OF EMOTION
BUT THE SHIP'S AIR TANKS WERE NEARLY EMPTY
YOU HAVE A SKIFF I REPLIED IN SOME ASTONISHMENT
FURNISHING SUCH ARGUMENTS TO A PROFESSIONAL HARPOONER WAS A WASTE OF WORDS
I FOUND NO ONE THERE
EVEN SO NED LAND HASN'T GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF RECOVERING HIS FREEDOM
VERNE REGARDS THE SEA FROM MANY ANGLES
SOME MAGIC LAY BEHIND THIS DAZZLING SIGHT
HE HAS A PRACTICAL MIND AND A DEMANDING STOMACH
APPARENTLY THEY WERE ENGINEERS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE LANGUAGES OF NEITHER THE FRENCH PHYSICIST ARAGO NOR THE ENGLISH PHYSICIST FARADAY
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A FAULTY MANEUVER BECAUSE THIS UNDERWATER TUNNEL WAS OBSTRUCTED BY SUCH BLOCKS AND DIDN'T MAKE FOR EASY NAVIGATING
DEFEATED MUTILATED BATTERED TO DEATH THE MONSTERS FINALLY YIELDED TO US AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE WAVES
I MIGHT ADD THAT THIS WAS A MAN OF GREAT PRIDE THAT HIS CALM FIRM GAZE SEEMED TO REFLECT THINKING ON AN ELEVATED PLANE AND THAT THE HARMONY OF HIS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND BODILY MOVEMENTS RESULTED IN AN OVERALL EFFECT OF UNQUESTIONABLE CANDOR ACCORDING TO THE FINDINGS OF PHYSIOGNOMISTS THOSE ANALYSTS OF FACIAL CHARACTER
WHO CAN SAY IT WON'T HUG THE COASTS OF FRANCE ENGLAND OR AMERICA WHERE AN ESCAPE ATTEMPT COULD BE CARRIED OUT JUST AS EFFECTIVELY AS HERE PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CANADIAN REPLIED YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE ROTTEN TO THE CORE
I MIGHT ADD THAT I COULD HARDLY USE OUR STATE OF HEALTH AS AN ARGUMENT
ITS PROPELLER CHURNED THE WAVES AND IT HEADED DUE NORTH AT A SPEED OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
ITS CONSTRUCTION WAS CONTINUED BY DARIUS THE GREAT SON OF HYSTASPES AND PROBABLY COMPLETED BY KING PTOLEMY II
HOW CAN I MAKE GUNPOWDER ON MY SHIP WHEN I HAVE NO SALTPETER SULFUR OR CHARCOAL EVEN SO I REPLIED TO FIRE UNDERWATER IN A MEDIUM THAT'S 855 TIMES DENSER THAN AIR YOU'D HAVE TO OVERCOME CONSIDERABLE RESISTANCE THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FOLLOW
THIS EFFECT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND FOR ANYONE WHO HAS NEVER SEEN LIGHT BEAMS SO SHARPLY DEFINED ON SHORE
I WAS EXPERIENCING THAT ACCOMPANYING NAUSEA THAT FOLLOWS SUCH CONTINUOUS SPINNING MOTIONS
THE NAUTILUS 53 12
BESIDES WORKING MEANT LEAVING THE NAUTILUS WHICH MEANT BREATHING THE CLEAN OXYGEN DRAWN FROM THE AIR TANKS AND SUPPLIED BY OUR EQUIPMENT WHICH MEANT LEAVING THE THIN FOUL AIR BEHIND
NOBODY APPEARED ON OUR ARRIVAL
THE AUTHOR OF A TWO-VOLUME WORK IN QUARTO ON THE MYSTERIES OF THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS HAS NO EXCUSE FOR NOT SETTING SAIL WITH COMMANDER FARRAGUT
AND I TOO COULD FEEL THE DIFFERENCE CREATED BY THE WATER'S POWERFUL DENSITY--DESPITE MY HEAVY CLOTHING COPPER HEADPIECE AND METAL SOLES I CLIMBED THE MOST IMPOSSIBLY STEEP GRADIENTS WITH ALL THE NIMBLENESS I SWEAR IT OF A CHAMOIS OR A PYRENEES MOUNTAIN GOAT
IF HIS DESTINY IS STRANGE IT'S ALSO SUBLIME
YOU'LL SEE SIR HOW TASTY THIS BREAD IS ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'VE GONE WITHOUT BAKED GOODS FOR SO LONG CONSEIL SAID
WE WERE THOROUGHLY SATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS OF OUR HUNTING
AND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
IN THE MIDST OF THE STONE MAZES FURROWING THIS ATLANTIC SEAFLOOR CAPTAIN NEMO MOVED FORWARD WITHOUT HESITATION
NO PROMISES FETTER US
THERE WERE SPARROW HAWKS WITH WHITE BELLIES AND SCREECHING KESTRELS
THE SHARK RETURNED ROLLED OVER ON ITS BACK AND WAS GETTING READY TO CUT THE INDIAN IN HALF WHEN CAPTAIN NEMO WHO WAS STATIONED BESIDE ME SUDDENLY STOOD UP
NED LAND WAS ON FAMILIAR TERMS WITH THIS FRUIT
IT WAS A CABIN MEASURING SIX FEET SQUARE AND CLOSELY RESEMBLING THOSE OCCUPIED BY THE HELMSMEN OF STEAMBOATS ON THE MISSISSIPPI OR HUDSON RIVERS
WE KEPT OUR HANDS OVER OUR EYES WHICH WERE UTTERLY SATURATED WITH THOSE CONCENTRIC GLEAMS THAT SWIRL BEFORE THE RETINA WHEN SUNLIGHT STRIKES IT TOO INTENSELY
IN TEN MINUTES THE TIDE WOULD REACH ITS MAXIMUM ELEVATION AND IF CAPTAIN NEMO HADN'T MADE A RASH PROMISE THE NAUTILUS WOULD IMMEDIATELY BREAK FREE
STONES DON'T FALL FROM THE SKY CONSEIL SAID OR ELSE THEY DESERVE TO BE CALLED METEORITES A SECOND WELL-POLISHED STONE REMOVED A TASTY RINGDOVE LEG FROM CONSEIL'S HAND GIVING STILL GREATER RELEVANCE TO HIS OBSERVATION
TRUE IT WAS A KILLER WHALE BELONGING TO THE BIGGEST KNOWN SPECIES WHOSE LENGTH SOMETIMES EXCEEDS TWENTY-FOUR FEET
FOR AN INSTANT I COULD GLIMPSE THE WONDERFUL RUINS OF THE TEMPLE OF HERCULES BURIED UNDERSEA AS PLINY AND AVIANUS HAVE MENTIONED TOGETHER WITH THE FLAT ISLAND THEY STAND ON
I ADMIT THAT I WAS LESS THAN READY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
THE AIR COMPRESSED INSIDE THE CRAFT SENT ITS DECKS FLYING AS IF THE POWDER STORES HAD BEEN IGNITED
ON A BED THERE LAY A MAN SOME FORTY YEARS OLD WITH STRONGLY MOLDED FEATURES THE VERY IMAGE OF AN ANGLO-SAXON
COMMANDER FARRAGUT THEN DECIDED TO USE MORE DIRECT METHODS
SO TILL I HAVE PROOF TO THE CONTRARY I'LL DENY THAT BALEEN WHALES SPERM WHALES OR UNICORNS CAN DO ANY SUCH THING LISTEN TO ME NED NO NO PROFESSOR
WE CUT THE EQUATOR
HIS FACIAL FEATURES WERE TRANSFIGURED
CONSEQUENTLY I HAD BEGUN TO GROPE MY WAY WHEN SUDDENLY I SAW THE GLOW OF AN INTENSE WHITE LIGHT
I WASN'T THE SUBJECT OF HIS HATE BECAUSE HE WASN'T EVEN LOOKING AT ME
IT WAS SWEEPING AROUND IN A SPIRAL WHOSE RADIUS KEPT GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
PEOPLE NOT ONLY CLAIMED THESE DEVILFISH COULD DRAG SHIPS UNDER BUT A CERTAIN OLAUS MAGNUS TELLS OF A CEPHALOPOD A MILE LONG THAT LOOKED MORE LIKE AN ISLAND THAN AN ANIMAL
HE SPOTTED A COCONUT PALM BEAT DOWN SOME OF ITS FRUIT BROKE THEM OPEN AND WE DRANK THEIR MILK AND ATE THEIR MEAT WITH A PLEASURE THAT WAS A PROTEST AGAINST OUR STANDARD FARE ON THE NAUTILUS
OH WHAT A GRUESOME TALE THESE MEDITERRANEAN DEPTHS COULD TELL THIS HUGE BONEYARD WHERE SO MUCH WEALTH HAS BEEN LOST WHERE SO MANY VICTIMS HAVE MET THEIR DEATHS
THEN THE NAUTILUS DREW NEAR THE BEACHES OF AFRICA WHERE THE SEA IS CONSIDERABLY DEEPER
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THESE DEPTHS ON A DARK NIGHT VERY MUCH I WARN YOU THIS WILL BE AN EXHAUSTING STROLL
EYES AND SPYGLASSES A BIT DAZZLED IT IS TRUE BY THE VISTA OF $2,000.00 DIDN'T REMAIN AT REST FOR AN INSTANT
IN 1829 THE ENGLISHMAN FORSTER COMMANDER OF THE CHANTICLEER LAID CLAIM TO THE ANTARCTIC CONTINENT IN LATITUDE 63 DEGREES 26 AND LONGITUDE 66 DEGREES 26 ON FEBRUARY 1 1831 THE ENGLISHMAN BISCOE DISCOVERED ENDERBY LAND AT LATITUDE 68 DEGREES 50 ADELAIDE LAND AT LATITUDE 67 DEGREES ON FEBRUARY 5 1832 AND GRAHAM LAND AT LATITUDE 64 DEGREES 45 ON FEBRUARY 21
WAS HE PLAYING ON MY CREDULITY
EVERY MORNING I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
BUT YOUR PROVISO APPLIES TO ANY ESCAPE ATTEMPT WHETHER IT HAPPENS IN TWO YEARS OR TWO DAYS
WE TILTED
THEN HE LOWERED HIS SPYGLASS AND EXCHANGED ABOUT TEN WORDS WITH HIS CHIEF OFFICER
I NO LONGER FELT THE ENTHUSIASM OF OUR FIRST DAYS ON BOARD
AFTER HE FINISHED SAYING MASS THIS ROCK STARTED MOVING AND WENT BACK INTO THE SEA
I WAS ON THE PLATFORM JUST THEN
LAURENCIA CLADOSTEPHUS WITH THE SLENDEREST FOLIAGE RHODYMENIA PALMATA RESEMBLING THE FAN SHAPES OF CACTUS
