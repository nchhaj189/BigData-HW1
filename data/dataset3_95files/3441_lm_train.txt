STORY OF PRINCE SAYF AL-MULUK AND THE PRINCESS BADI'A AL-JAMAL THE BOOK OF THE THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT WHEN IT WAS THE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY-SEVENTH NIGHT SHAHRAZAD CONTINUED IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SA'ADAN HAVING BROKEN INTO THE PALACE OF KING JAMAK AND POUNDED TO PIECES THOSE THEREIN THE SURVIVORS CRIED OUT QUARTER
BUT THE MOSLEM CHAMPIONS MET THEM AND LEFT MOST OF THEM PROSTRATE ON THE EARTH WHILST THE REST TURNED AND SOUGHT SAFETY IN FLIGHT SEEKING SURER SITE WHILE THE CLANKING SABRES THEIR BACK-SIDES SMITE
OR HAPLY I CATCH SIGHT OF HIM UNEXPECTEDLY AND AM CONFOUNDED AND THE BLOOD AND THE LIFE FLY MY BODY AND I ABIDE IN UNREASONING PLIGHT A WEEK OR E'EN A SE'NNIGHT SAID I EXCUSE ME FOR I ALSO HAVE SUFFERED THAT WHICH IS UPON THEE OF LOVE LONGING AND DISTRACTION OF SOUL AND WASTING OF FRAME AND LOSS OF STRENGTH
HAKAMATHA-TAKUNAH=SAPIENTIA DIS POSITIONIS ASTRORUM ASIAT
SUCH WAS THEIR CASE;[FN#452 BUT AS REGARDS THE TWO PRINCESSES THEY CAME TO THE PAVILION AND ENTERING THEREIN AFTER THE EUNUCHS HAD RICHLY FURNISHED IT ACCORDING TO COMMAND SAT DOWN ON THE COUCH OF GOLD BESIDE WHICH WAS A WINDOW THAT GAVE UPON THE GARDEN
AFTER WHICH THEY CUT OFF A SPAN'S LENGTH OF THEIR HEADS AND TAILS AND THREW IT AWAY
IF BENT ON WILFUL AIMS AND LEWD I FAIN FORSWEAR THEE AH WHEN SHE HAD MADE AN END OF HER WRITING THIS SHE CAST THE WRIT FROM HER HAND IN WRATH AND THE OLD WOMAN PICKED IT UP AND WENT WITH IT TO ARDASHIR
THE PROPHET CALLED IT BLESSED BECAUSE ORDERED BY AN ANGEL TO PRAY THEREIN
THEN AFTER A MOMENT THE WAZIR FARIS AROSE AND KISSING GROUND SAID O EMIRS O GRANDEES YE KEN THAT I AM WAZIR AND THAT MY WAZIRATE DATETH FROM OLD BEFORE THE ACCESSION OF KING ASIM BIN SAFWAN WHO HATH NOW DIVESTED HIMSELF OF THE KINGSHIP AND MADE HIS SON KING IN HIS STEAD ANSWERED THEY YES WE KNOW THAT THY WAZIRATE IS FROM SIRE AFTER GRANDSIRE HE CONTINUED AND NOW IN MY TURN I DIVEST MYSELF OF OFFICE AND INVEST THIS MY SON SA'ID FOR HE IS INTELLIGENT QUICK-WITTED SAGACIOUS
ADD AND WITH HIM A HOST OF OTHERS AFTER HIS KIND
THEN MAKING THE COCK-BOAT FAST TO THE COAST AND LEAVING ONE THEREIN TO GUARD IT THEY FARED ON INTO THE ISLAND WHERE THEY FOUND ABUNDANCE OF FRUITS OF ALL COLOURS AND ATE OF THEM TILL THEY WERE SATISFIED
BUT AS FOR THE GIRL WHO IS WITH HER THERE IS NONE IN OUR LAND RESEMBLETH HER IN FAVOUR OR APPROACHETH HER IN FAIRNESS SAVE THE PRINCESS HAYAT AL-NUFUS WHO IS SECLUDED AND NEVER GOETH OUT
YA KHAWAND IN BRESL
FN#295 HARDLY THE EQUIVALENT OF THE ARAB
THEN THE HOST OF THE MOSLEMS CRAVE AT THE HEATHENRY CALLING FOR HELP UPON THE LORD OF THE THREE WORLDS AND THEY CEASED NOT FROM FIGHT AND FRAY TILL THE DAY CAME TO AN END WHEN THEY DREW APART
NI'AM WHICH ANSWERS A NEGATIVE DOST THOU NOT GO?"--NI'AM YES
WHEREUPON THE BROKER SALUTED HIM WITH THE SALAM AND ASKED HIM THE REASON OF HIS ENCHANTMENT
AND SHE REPLIED HEARTEN ME BY EATING A BIT AND DRINKING A SUP OF WATER."[FN#210 THEY CONSENTED AND ENTERING ATE AND DRANK TILL THEY WERE DRUNKEN WHEN SHE DRUGGED THEM WITH BHANG AND STRIPPED THEM OF THEIR CLOTHES AND ARMS
ON THIS WISE FARED IT WITH THE PRINCE
BUT OF MALICE PREPENSE I THREW SELF AWAY UNWITTING OF LOVE WHAT HIS NATURE BE AND SAYF AL-MULUK CEASED NOT TO WEEP AND WAIL AND BEAT FACE AND BREAST TILL SA'ID AWOKE AND MISSING HIM FROM THE BED AND SEEING BUT A SINGLE CANDLE SAID TO HIMSELF WHITHER IS SAYF AL-MULUK GONE THEN HE TOOK THE OTHER CANDLE AND WENT ROUND ABOUT THE PALACE TILL HE CAME UPON THE CLOSET WHERE HE SAW THE PRINCE LYING AT FULL LENGTH WEEPING WITH SORE WEEPING AND LAMENTING ALOUD
NOR IS THERE ANY WAY FOR ME THERETO
AND PRESENTLY HE LOVED HIM AND MADE MUCH OF HIM AND ON THIS WISE THEY FARED ON TILL NIGHTFALL WHEN THEY DISMOUNTED AND ATE AND DRANK
THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT I CONTRIVE A MEANS FOR OUR REUNION THEN SHE FAREWELLED HIM AND FARED FORTH KNOWING NOT WHERE SHE SET HER FEET FOR STRESS OF HER LOVE
NOW KING KHIRAD SHAH HAD A BROTHER SIRAN THE SORCERER HIGHS THAN WHOM THERE WAS NO GREATER WIZARD IN HIS DAY AND HE LIVED APART FROM HIS BROTHER IN A CERTAIN STRONGHOLD CALLED THE FORTALICE OF FRUITS,[FN#68 IN A PLACE ABOUNDING IN TREES AND STREAMS AND BIRDS AND BLOOMS HALF A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM SHIRAS
WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FOURTEENTH NIGHT SHE PURSUED IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN DALILAH WAS ADMITTED HASAN ASKED HER WHAT BRINGETH THEE HITHER O ILL-OMENED OLD WOMAN
BUT THIS DAY IS THE LAST OF THY WORLDLY DAYS WHEN SA'ADAN HEARD THESE WORDS HIS EYES WAXED BLOOD-RED AND HE CRAVE AT BATTASH AND AIMED A STROKE AT HIM WITH HIS CLUB
WHY DIDST THOU NOT TELL ME IT WAS HIS CHILD WHAT HATH BEFALLEN HIM CRIED ZURAYK AND HASAN REPLIED WE GAVE HIM RAISINS TO EAT AND HE CHOKED AND DIED AND THIS IS HE QUOTH ZURAYK ALAS MY SON

AFTER WHICH THEY RETURNED AND TOLD GHARIB WHO BLESSED ALLAH AND GLORIFIED HIM SAYING PRAISED BE THE ALMIGHTY WHO HATH MADE THIS THING EASY TO US WITHOUT STRIFE THEN HE ABODE IN CASHMERE OF INDIA FORTY DAYS TILL HE HAD ORDERED THE AFFAIRS OF THE COUNTRY AND CAST DOWN THE SHRINES AND TEMPLES OF THE FIRE AND BUILT IN THEIR STEAD MOSQUES AND CATHEDRALS WHILST RA'AD SHAH MADE READY FOR HIM RARITIES AND TREASURES BEYOND COUNT AND DESPATCHED THEM TO AL-IRAK IN SHIPS THEN GHARIB MOUNTED ON KAYLAJAN'S BACK AND JAMRKAN AND SA'ADAN ON THAT OF KURAJAN AFTER THEY HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF RA'AD SHAH
AFTER WHICH HE COMMANDED THE BATTLE DRUMS TO SOUND THE POINT OF WAR
BUT OTBAH'S DAYS WERE ENDED

THE CREATOR FATIR OR THE ANGELS SO CALLED FROM THE FIRST VERSE
WHEN HE READ IT AND UNDERSTOOD IT HE SAID TO ME O SHAYKH WE HAVE TAKEN OTHER IN HER STEAD
FOR IT HATH A VAST CITY[FN#392 AND A SAFE WHEREIN ARE STORE OF RARITIES AND THINGS OF PRICE AND FOLK OF ALL KINDS
WHAT HAST THOU TO DO WITH MY SOUL I REJOINED O HATIM,[FN#423 THERE REMAINETH NONE TO ME BUT THOU EXCEPT ALLAH

FN#423 PROBABLY USED IN ITS SENSE OF A BLACK CROW THE BRESL
THE TWO PLACES ARE ALSO MENTIONED BY AL-MAS'UDI
NOW THE CAUSE THEREOF WAS THAT WHEN THE YOUNG PRINCE HAD DELAYED BEYOND MEASURE THE KING HIS SIRE HAD LEVIED A MIGHTY HOST AND HAD MARCHED WITH IT IN PERSON TO GET TIDINGS OF HIS SON
AND SHE CALLED HIM SAYING HITHER O DONKEY-BOY SO HE CAME TO HER AND SHE ASKED KNOWEST THOU MY SON THE DYER

SWEET LIPPED AND SOFT SIDED INDEED IS SHE NOW WHEN JULNAR HEARD WHAT SALIH SAID SHE REPLIED THOU SAYEST SOOTH O MY BROTHER
HE ENTERED AND TAKING THE SADDLE-BAGS OFF THE ASS'S BACK SET UP THE ROD AND HUNG TO IT THE CHARGER WHEREIN WERE THE CLOTHES PROCLAIMING ALOUD WHERE BE THE CLEVER ONES OF ALL QUARTERS WHO MAY AVAIL TO TAKE THIS DRESS THEN HE CONJURED AS BEFORE AND MEAT WAS SET BEFORE HIM AND HE ATE AND THEN WINE WHEN HE DRANK
BUT HE FOUND NO WAY TO THIS WHEREFORE HIS BREAST WAS STRAITENED
WHEREUPON SHE ROSE AND EMBRACING HIM SEATED HIM BY HER SIDE AND ASKED HIM O MY BROTHER HOW ART THOU AND MY MOTHER AND MY COUSINS HE ANSWERED O MY SISTER THEY ARE WELL AND GLAD AND IN GOOD CASE LACKING NAUGHT SAVE A SIGHT OF THY FACE THEN SHE SET SOMEWHAT OF FOOD BEFORE HIM AND HE ATE AFTER WHICH TALK ENSUED BETWEEN THE TWAIN AND THEY SPAKE OF KING BADR BASIM AND HIS BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS HIS SYMMETRY AND SKILL IN CAVALARICE AND CLEVERNESS AND GOOD BREEDING
THE PRINCESS STARTLED BY THE DREAM AWOKE TROUBLED AND SAID THUS DO MEN WITH WOMEN FOR WOMEN HAVE PITY ON MEN AND THROW AWAY THEIR LIVES FOR THEM WHEN THEY ARE IN DIFFICULTIES
WHO DARE SPEAK SUCH WORD SO SHE TOOK THE LETTER AND AFTER READING AND UNDERSTANDING IT SHE SMOTE HAND ON HAND SAYING VERILY THIS IS A CALAMITY WHICH IS FALLEN UPON US AND I KNOW NOT WHENCE THIS YOUNG MAN CAME TO US QUOTH THE OLD WOMAN O MY LADY ALLAH UPON THEE WRITE HIM ANOTHER LETTER
FOR THAT THESE JEWELS AND JACINTHS ARE MORE PLENTIFUL WITH US THAN PEBBLES ON THE BEACH AND WE KNOW THE GOOD AND THE BAD OF THEM AND THEIR WHEREABOUTS AND THE WAY TO THEM AND THEY ARE EASY TO US WHEN THE KING SAW THE JEWELS HIS WITS WERE BEWILDERED AND HIS SENSE WAS ASTOUNDED AND HE SAID BY ALLAH ONE SINGLE GEM OF THESE JEWELS IS WORTH MY REALM THEN HE THANKED FOR HIS BOUNTY SALIH THE SEA BORN AND LOOKING TOWARDS QUEEN JULNAR SAID I AM ABASHED BEFORE THY BROTHER FOR THAT HE HATH DEALT MUNIFICENTLY BY ME AND BESTOWED ON ME THIS SPLENDID GIFT WHICH THE FOLK OF THE LAND WERE UNABLE TO PRESENT SO SHE THANKED HER BROTHER FOR HIS DEED AND HE SAID O KING OF THE AGE THOU HAST THE PRIOR CLAIM ON US AND IT BEHOVES US TO THANK THEE FOR THOU HAST ENTREATED OUR SISTER WITH KINDNESS AND WE HAVE ENTERED THY DWELLING AND EATEN OF THY VICTUAL
NOW A SATAN HAD ENTERED THE BELLY OF THE IDOL AND SPEAKING AS WITH ITS TONGUE SAID O KING THERE IS COME TO THY CITY ONE HIGHS GHARIB KING OF AL-IRAK WHO BIDDETH THE FOLK QUIT THEIR BELIEF AND WORSHIP HIS LORD
AND IF THOU HAVE A MIND TO MARRY ZAYNAB BRING WITH THEE ALSO THE FORTY CARRIER-PIGEONS SO ALI WENT TO THE KHAN AND GOING IN TO THE COOK SALUTED HIM AND SAID TIS LONG SINCE I HAVE MET THEE IN THE BEER-KEN THE SLAVE REPLIED I HAVE BEEN BUSY COOKING FOR THE SLAVES AND THE DOGS THEN HE TOOK HIM AND MAKING HIM DRUNKEN QUESTIONED HIM OF HIS WORK

MY SIGHT IS GONE AND I AM BLIND AND CLAPPING MY HAND TO MY EYES FELL A-WEEPING AND A-WAILING WHILST THE ACCURSED LAUGHED AND SAID FEAR NOT THOU ART NOW BECOME LIKE MINE OTHER GUESTS BUT AS FOR MY TWO COMRADES THEY DRANK THE MILK AND BECAME BLIND

THEN CAME FORTH MURAD SHAH ARMED CAP-A-PIE AND CRAVE HIS CHARGER RIGHT AND LEFT CRYING O FOLK LET NONE COME FORTH TO ME BUT YOUR KING
SO THEY WAITED TILL THE INFIDELS FELL ASLEEP WHEN JAMRKAN COM-MENDED THEM TO MOUNT AND THEY ROSE TO RIDE AND ON THE LORD OF THE WORLDS THEY RELIED
THEN HE LOOKED AT THEM AND ASKED WHO HATH PLAYED YOU THIS TRICK AND MADE YOU NAKED
THEN SAID SHE TO HIM FORTIFY THY HEART FOR THOU ART GOING TO THE KING'S PALACE WHERE THERE WILL WITHOUT FAIL BE GUARDS AND EUNUCHS AT THE GATE
SO THE OLD SCOTTISH HIGHLANDERS NEVER ASKED THE NAME OR CLAN OF A CHANCE GUEST LEST HE PROVE A FOE BEFORE HE HAD EATEN THEIR FOOD
HOWEVER HE CONCEALED HIS CASE AND SPAKE NOT OF HER TO HIS MOTHER OR HIS UNCLE ALBEIT HE WAS ON COALS OF FIRE FOR LOVE OF HER
BUT THE KING RECEIVED HIM WITH A LANCE THRUST IN THE BREAST SO DOUR THAT THE POINT ISSUED FROM BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS AND ALLAH HURRIED HIS SOUL TO THE FIRE THE ABIDING-PLACE DIRE
NOR DID MORNING DAWN BEFORE THE MOST PART OF THE UNBELIEVERS WERE SPECIES WITHOUT SOULS AND THE REST MADE FOR THE WASTES AND MARSHES WHILST GHARIB AND MURA'ASH RETURNED TRIUMPHANT AND VICTORIOUS
THEN HE OPENED HIS ARMOURIES AND DISTRIBUTED ARMS AND ARMOUR TO THE TROOPS AFTER WHICH HE SET OUT WITH THEM AND JOURNEYED TILL HE CAME TO ISBANIR AND ALL ENCAMPED BEFORE THE CITY-GATE

WHEREUPON HE AND HIS PEOPLE FLED AND STAYED NOT IN THEIR FLIGHT TILL THEY REACHED THE FORTALICE OF FRUITS AND WENT INTO SIRAN CRYING OUT AND EXCLAIMING WOE AND RUIN AND THE RED KING SAID TO SIRAN O SAGE GHARIB HATH WITH HIM THE ENCHANTED SWORD OF JAPHET SON OF NOAH AND WHOMSOEVER HE SMITETH THEREWITH HE SEVERETH HIM IN SUNDER AND WITH HIM ALSO ARE TWO MARIDS FROM MOUNT CAUCASUS GIVEN TO HIM BY KING MURA'ASH

BUT DO THOU CHARGE HASAN SHUMAN TO LAY HANDS ON HER FOR HE KNOWETH HER AND HER DAUGHTER ALSO THEN HASAN INTERCEDED FOR HER WITH THE CALIPH SAYING INDEED SHE HATH NOT PLAYED OFF THESE TRICKS BECAUSE SHE COVETED THE FOLK'S STUFF BUT TO SHOW HER CLEVERNESS AND THAT OF HER DAUGHTER TO THE INTENT THAT THOU SHOULDST CONTINUE HER HUSBAND'S STIPEND TO HER AND THAT OF HER FATHER TO HER DAUGHTER

BUT AS REGARDS DALILAH THE WILY WHEN THE DAY BROKE ONE OF THE LODGERS IN THE KHAN CAME OUT OF HIS CHAMBER AND SEEING THE GATE OPEN AND THE SLAVES DRUGGED AND THE DOGS DEAD HE WENT IN TO HER AND FOUND HER LYING DRUGGED WITH A SCROLL ON HER NECK AND AT HER HEAD A SPONGE STEEPED IN THE COUNTER-DRUG
FOR THEY WOULD HAVE DEEMED EVILLY OF ME AND WOULD NOT HAVE CREDITED ME EVEN ALTHOUGH I SWORE TO THEM AN I TOLD THEM THAT A KING HAD BOUGHT ME WITH HIS GOLD AND MADE ME HIS PORTION OF THE WORLD AND PREFERRED ME OVER ALL HIS WIVES AND EVERY THING THAT HIS RIGHT HAND POSSESSED
THEN HE RAISED THE CHIEF'S HEAD ON HIS SPEAR-POINT AND RETURNED TO THE MERCHANTS WHO REWARDED HIM LIBERALLY AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY TILL THEY REACHED BAGHDAD
SO WHEN MANY DAYS OF FRUITLESS WAITING HAD GONE BY SHE AROSE AND GOING DOWN INTO THE SEA REPAIRED TO HER MOTHER WHO SIGHTING HER ROSE TO HER AND KISSED HER AND EMBRACED HER AS DID THE MERMAIDS HER COUSINS

THINE ERRAND SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED TO THE UTTERMOST IF IT BE THE WILL OF ALLAH THE MOST HIGH LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH AND THE LIGHT WHICH FOLLOWETH THE GLOOM
HE ROSE UP STANDING AND RECEIVED HIM WITH HONOUR
SO FARED IT WITH HER
SO HAPLY ALLAH ALMIGHT MAY INCLINE HER HEART TO THEE AND SHE MAY GRANT THEE THY WISH THEN SHE CALLED THE HANDMAID MARJANAH HIGHT AND SAID TO HER AS THOU LOVEST ME DO MY ERRAND THIS DAY AND BE NOT NEGLECTFUL THEREIN
THEN SHE WENT AWAY WITH THE MAIDENS OF THE ARABS AND THE CALIPH SAID TO JA'AFAR THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT I TAKE HER TO WIFE SO JA'AFAR REPAIRED TO HER FATHER AND SAID TO HIM THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL HATH A MIND TO THY DAUGHTER HE REPLIED WITH LOVE AND GOODWILL SHE IS A GIFT AS A HANDMAID TO HIS HIGHNESS OUR LORD THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL SO HE EQUIPPED HER AND CARRIED HER TO THE CALIPH WHO TOOK HER TO WIFE AND WENT IN TO HER AND SHE BECAME OF THE DEAREST OF HIS WOMEN TO HIM
FOR HE HAD LIVED AN HUNDRED AND FOURSCORE YEARS AND HAD NO CHILD MALE OR FEMALE BY REASON WHEREOF HE WAS EVER IN CARK AND CARE FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AND FROM NIGHT TO MORN
AND SO THEY CONTINUED FOR A LONG TIME
THERE REMAINS NOT A JOINT IN HIS LIMBS BUT WHAT DISEASE FIRM FIXT EVER TORTURETH
THOU SEEST THIS FOR THAT REPINING QUOTH I O MAID AND WHAT BETIDETH THEE OF THY LOVE FOR THIS MAN
52-54 FN#255 SHE COULD LEGALLY COMPEL HIM TO SELL HER
THEIR JOY WAS CHANGED INTO ANNOY AND BEHOLD THE PROVOST CAME IN WHEN HIS WIFE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN AND HE WENT OUT IN QUEST OF THE CHILD WHILST THE OTHER MERCHANTS ALSO FARED FORTH AND EACH SOUGHT HIS OWN ROAD
SO WHEN HE SAW HIS KINSMAN IN THIS PLIGHT HE ASKED FOR THE TRUTH OF WHAT AILED HIM AND AJIB TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM FIRST AND LAST FROM HIS BROTHER AND SAID O KING GHARIB BIDDETH THE FOLK WORSHIP THE LORD OF THE HEAVENS AND FORBIDDETH THEM FROM THE SERVICE OF SIMULACRES AND OTHER OF THE GODS WHEN JALAND HEARD THESE WORDS HE RAGED AND REVOLTED AND SAID BY THE VIRTUE OF THE SUN LORD OF LIFE AND LIGHT I WILL NOT LEAVE ONE OF THY BROTHER'S FOLK IN EXISTENCE
AND THEY REPLIED THIS IS THE HARIM OF MARDAS CHIEF OF THE BANU KAHTAN AND HIS GOOD AND THAT OF HIS CLAN
THE LIKE HE DID AT SUNDOWN AND DRUGGED DALILAH'S FOOD AND THAT OF ZAYNAB AND THE SLAVES
ONE DAY THE DAMSEL TOOK HER MISTRESS AT UNAWARES AND GOING FORTH THE PALACE REPAIRED TO THE OLD GROCER TO WHOM SHE TOLD THE WHOLE CASE SAYING QUEEN LAB IS MINDED TO MAKE AN END OF THY BROTHER'S SON THE SHAYKH THANKED HER AND SAID THERE IS NO HELP BUT THAT I TAKE THE CITY FROM HER AND MAKE THEE QUEEN THEREOF IN HER STEAD THEN HE WHISTLED A LOUD WHISTLE AND THERE CAME FORTH TO HIM AN IFRIT WITH FOUR WINGS TO WHOM HE SAID TAKE UP THIS DAMSEL AND CARRY HER TO THE CITY OF JULNAR THE SEA-BORN AND HER MOTHER FARASHAH[FN#346 FOR THEY TWAIN ARE THE MOST POWERFUL MAGICIANS ON FACE OF EARTH AND HE SAID TO THE DAMSEL WHEN THOU COMEST THITHER TELL THEM THAT KING BADR BASIM IS QUEEN LAB'S CAPTIVE THEN THE IFRIT TOOK UP HIS LOAD AND FLYING OFF WITH HER IN A LITTLE WHILE SET HER DOWN UPON THE TERRACE ROOF OF QUEEN JULNAR'S PALACE
THERE THEY ABODE IN THE ENJOYMENT OF FAIR ENTERTAINMENT FOR FORTY DAYS AT THE END OF WHICH QUOTH THE KING OF CHINA TO SAYF AL-MULUK O SON OF MY BROTHER HOW IS THY CASE[FN#396

AND I REPLIED THOU SHALT PRESENTLY SEE THE ISSUE THEREOF AND BEHOLD NOW ITS ISSUE THOU SEEST
AND ABDULLAH BIN MA'AMAR AL KAYSI HATH THUS RELATED THE TALE OF OTBAH[FN#79 AND RAYYA
THEN GHARIB ENTERED HIS PALACE AND SITTING DOWN ON THE THRONE OF HIS KINGSHIP PASSED THE DAY IN ORDERING THE AFFAIRS OF THE STATE
AND SAYF AL-MULUK REPLIED IT BEHOVETH US TO ASK AID OF ALLAH ALMIGHTY WHO HATH AFFLICTED US
I KNEW AN OFFICER IN INDIA WHOSE MISTRESS HURT HIS FEELINGS BY SO DOING AT A CRITICAL TIME WHEN HE ATTRIBUTED HER MOVEMENT TO PLEASURE
IF THY BREAST BE STRAITENED TAKE A TURN IN THE STREETS OF CAIRO FOR ASSUREDLY WALKING IN HER MARKETS WILL DO AWAY WITH THY IRK SO HE ROSE UP AND WENT OUT AND THREADED THE STREETS AWHILE BUT ONLY INCREASED IN CARK AND CARE
THE LOVERS OF AL-MEDINAH 150
NOW WHEN HER MATE FLEW AWAY WITH THE OTHERS A BIRD OF RAVEN SEIZED HIM AND SLEW HIM AND ATE HIS FLESH AND DRANK HIS BLOOD AND I WOULD HAVE YOU POURTRAY ME THE PRESENTMENT OF THIS MY DREAM EVEN AS I HAVE RELATED IT TO YOU IN THE LIVELIEST COLOURS LAYING THE FAIR SCENE IN THIS RARE GARDEN WITH ITS WALLS AND TREES AND RILLS AND DWELL ESPECIALLY ON THE FOWLER AND THE FALCON
THEY ARE THE GUESTS OF MURA'ASH KING OF THE JANN AND WILL BE WITH YOU ANON WHEN GHARIB'S MEN HEARD THAT HE WAS SAFE AND WELL THEY JOYED WITH EXCEEDING JOY AND SAID TO THE MARIDS ALLAH GLADDEN YOU TWAIN WITH GOOD NEWS O NOBLE SPIRITS SO KURAJAN AND KAYLAJAN RETURNED TO MURA'ASH AND GHARIB
SO THE BEASTS OF THE SEA AND THE ELEPHANTS AND LEOPARDS AND LYNXES AND ALL BEASTS OF THE LAND RANGED THEMSELVES IN ESPALIER ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WAY AFTER THEIR SEVERAL KINDS AND SIMILARLY THE JINN DREW OUT IN TWO RANKS APPEARING ALL TO MORTAL EYES WITHOUT CONCEALMENT IN DIVERS FORMS GRISLY AND GRUESOME
DEATH HARBOURS IN HIS LANGUID EYE AND SLAYS WITH EVERY GLANCE AND IN HIS CHEEK IS DRUNKENNESS AND NOT IN ANY WINE AND IN THAT OF ANOTHER UPSPRINGS FROM TABLE OF HIS LOVELY CHEEKS[FN#316 A GROWTH LIKE BROIDERY MY WONDER IS
WHEN SHE REACHED THE PALACE SHE ENQUIRED FOR THE KING AND THE SLAVE-GIRLS AND CONCUBINES REPLIED TO HER O MY LADY HE IS GONE FORTH A-HUNTING AND SPORTING SO SHE RETURNED AS SHE WERE A RENDING LIONESS AND BESPAKE NONE FOR THE SPACE OF THREE HOURS WHEN HER BROW CLEARED AND HER WRATH COOLED
UP CAME THE ARMY OF AL-YAMAN LIKE A FLOCK OF SHEEP FILLING PLAIN AND STEEP AND JAMRKAN AND THE BANU AMIR FELL UPON THEM SHOUTING ALLAHO AKBAR TILL ALL HEARD IT MOSLEMS AND MISCREANTS
THE EMINENT TURKISH SCHOLAR WOULD ALSO TRANSLATE SALAT BY WORSHIP DU'A BEING PRAYER BECAUSE IT SIGNIFIES A SIMPLE ACT OF ADORATION WITHOUT ENTREATY
AND IN THIS GARDEN IS A GREAT TANK
THEN THE SHAYKH SAID TO THEM O MY LORDS HAVE YE ANY NEED THAT WE MAY HAVE THE HONOUR OF ACCOMPLISHING
HE PASSED ON AND PRESENTLY CAME TO THE KING'S PAVILION WHERE HE FOUND KING JALAND ASLEEP UNATTENDED
BUT AS REGARDS THE KAFIRS THE SURVIVORS RETURNED TO JALAND AND MADE KNOWN TO HIM THE SLAYING OF HIS SON AND THE SLAUGHTER OF HIS HOST HEARING WHICH HE CAST HIS CROWN TO THE GROUND AND BUFFETING HIS FACE TILL THE BLOOD RAN FROM HIS NOSTRILS FELL FAINTING TO THE FLOOR
SO HE TOOK THE LUTE AND SWEPT THE STRINGS AND BY ALLAH I FANCIED THEY SPOKE IN ARABIC TONGUE WITH A SWEET AND LIQUID AND MURMUROUS VOICE
PRESENTLY UP CAME A MAN AND A MERCHANT WHO ACCOSTED THE JEW AND SAID TO HIM O MASTER WILT THOU SELL ME YONDER BEAR
BUT THE THIRD I PREFERRED FOR SHE SAID IN REPLY WITH EXPRESSION MOST APPOSITE EXQUISITE MY SOUL AND MY FOLK I ENGAGE FOR THE YOUTH MUSK SCENTED I SEE IN MY BED EVERY NIGHT
THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE
THE FIRST TO MEET HIM WAS SAHIM WHO KISSED HIS FEET IN THE STIRRUPS AND SAID MAY THY HAND NEVER WITHER O CHAMPION OF THE AGE
THE GLOOMS ARE THE HANDS AND THE FULL MOONS ARE THE EYES
ONE DAY I WENT OUT TO AL-MIRBAD,[FN#153 BY WAY OF AL-MUHALIYAH;[FN#154 AND BEING OPPRESSED BY THE EXCESSIVE HEAT WENT UP TO A GREAT DOOR TO ASK FOR DRINK WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY AWARE OF A DAMSEL AS SHE WERE A BRANCH SWAYING WITH EYES LANGUISHING EYE BROWS ARCHED AND FINELY PENCILLED AND SMOOTH CHEEKS ROUNDED CLAD IN A SHIFT THE COLOUR OF A POMEGRANATE FLOWER AND A MANTILLA OF SANA'A[FN#155 WORK
MANY A WOMAN EVEN OF THE WORLD HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A MAN BEFORE INDIFFERENT TO HER BECAUSE HE DID NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HER WHEN HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
AND THIS WAS NECESSARILY A CANAL
158-169 =775-785 AND FATHER OF HARUN AL-RASHID
AND RETURNING TO HIS MASTER DELIVERED HIM THE REPLY AND ABD AL-KADIR'S MESSAGE AND REPEATED ALL THEIR TALK WHEREAT HE REJOICED GREATLY AND ARDASHIR WAS TRANSPORTED FOR DELIGHT AND HIS BREAST BROADENED AND HE WAS A MOST HAPPY MAN
ALA RAGHM A FAVOURITE TERM
THEN HE ENTERED THE HAMMAM-BATH AND LOOKING AT HIS FACE IN THE MIRROR NOTED THAT THE WHITE HAIRS IN HIS BEARD OVERLAY ITS BLACK AND HE SAID IN HIMSELF WILL NOT HE WHO TOOK THY SIRE BLESS THEE WITH A SON SO HE WENT IN TO HIS WIFE IN ANGRY MOOD AND SHE SAID TO HIM GOOD EVENING TO THEE
FN#338 HERE THE SHAYKH IS MISTAKEN
YET FOR ALL HIS TONGUE STILL HE SILENCETH
BUT FORMERLY USED BY AL-MAS'UDI AND OTHER GOOD WRITERS
QUESTION THE NIGHT OF ME AND NIGHT THY SOUL SHALL SATISFY MINE EYELIDS NEVER CLOSE IN SLEEP THROUGHOUT THE LIVELONG NIGHT THEN HE WEPT WITH SORE WEEPING AND PLAINED OF THAT HE SUFFERED FOR STRESS OF LOVE-LONGING
FASC

AN HE BE IN THIS CITY HE WILL TAKE HIM AND DEPART FROM YOU
SO HE DRUGGED HIM AND DID AS WE HAVE SEEN
HOW CAME SHE BY THIS FELLOW
VERILY I MEAN TO PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING WHO WILL GIVE ME MORE THAN THOU WOULDEST GIVE ME AND WILL NOT KILL HIM BUT WILL DIVERT HIMSELF BY GAZING UPON HIS BEAUTY AND GRACE FOR IN ALL MY LIFE SINCE I HAVE BEEN A FOWLER I NEVER SAW HIS LIKE AMONG LAND GAME OR WATER FOWL
AFTER THIS ONE NIGHT HE DREAMT A TERRIBLE DREAM AND AWOKE TROUBLED AND TREMBLING
INDEED WE KNOW BY TRADITION THAT THEY HAD TRANSLATIONS NOW APPARENTLY LOST
AND WE ANSWERED WE DEMAND THY NOBLE DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE FOR OTBAH BIN HUBAB BIN MUNDHIR THE ILLUSTRIOUS AND WELL BORN O MY BRETHREN SAID HE SHE WHOM YOU DEMAND IS OWNER OF HERSELF AND I WILL GO IN TO HER AND TELL HER SO HE ROSE IN WRATH[FN#88 AND WENT IN TO RAYYA WHO SAID TO HIM O MY PAPA WHY DO I SEE THEE SHOW ANGER AND HE REPLIED SAYING CERTAIN OF THE ANSARIS HAVE COME UPON ME TO DEMAND THY HAND OF ME IN MARRIAGE QUOTH SHE THEY ARE NOBLE CHIEFS
AND ZURAYK SAID HAST THOU BROUGHT THE PURSE SO ALI THOUGHT IT WAS HASAN SHUMAN AND REPLIED I HAVE BROUGHT IT;[FN#246 OPEN THE DOOR QUOTH ZURAYK IMPOSSIBLE THAT I OPEN TO THEE TILL I SEE THE PURSE
I ONCE BEGAN TO WRITE A BIOGRAPHY OF THE DEVIL
AN SHE HAVE ANY ONE IN MIND LET HER TELL US OF HIM AND WE WILL DO HER WILL AS FAR AS MAY BE DO THOU MAKE ANSWER O MY LADY THY DAUGHTER SAITH TO THEE YE WERE MINDED AFORETIME TO MARRY ME TO SOLOMON ON WHOM BE PEACE AND PORTRAYED HIM MY PORTRAIT ON A TUNIC
300 MOSLEMS DO NOT PAY FOR PRAYERS TO BENEFIT THE DEAD LIKE THE MAJORITY OF CHRISTENDOM AND ACCORDING TO CALVINISTIC WAHHABI-ISM THEIR PRAYERS AND BLESSINGS ARE OF NO AVAIL
NOW A CERTAIN BADAWI HAD HEARD ONE MAN SAY TO A FRIEND PRAISE BE TO ALLAH FOR THY SAFE RETURN
AND IF I LEFT HIM I ALSO SHOULD DIE FOR THE EXCESS OF THE LOVE I BEAR HIM BY REASON OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS TO ME DURING THE TIME OF MY SOJOURN WITH HIM
AND AT LAST HE GAVE A THUNDERING KNOCK THAT AWOKE ALL THE MEN AND THEY SAID THAT IS ALI OF CAIRO'S PECULIAR RAP SO THE HALL-KEEPER OPENED TO HIM AND HASAN SHUMAN SAID TO HIM HAST THOU BROUGHT THE PURSE REPLIED ALI ENOUGH OF JESTING O SHUMAN
SO AN THOU WILT SPARE HER LIFE I WILL FETCH HER TO THEE CRIED THE CALIPH BY THE LIFE OF MY ANCESTORS IF SHE RESTORE THE PEOPLE'S GOODS I WILL PARDON HER ON THINE INTERCESSION AND SAID THE PESTILENCE GIVE ME A PLEDGE O PRINCE OF TRUE BELIEVERS WHEREUPON AL-RASHID GAVE HIM THE KERCHIEF OF PARDON
NOR PATIENCE BIDES WITH ME NOR PLAN APPEARS
AND SHE ANSWERED THE VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE BUT THE MANNER OF OUR SEPARATION WAS STRANGE
SO HE STOOD UP AND KISSED THE GROUND BETWEEN THE HANDS OF GHARIB SAYING THE BLESSING OF THE FIRE BE ON THEE AND LONG LIFE BE THY LIFE O KING GHARIB CRIED O DOG OF THE PERSIANS FIRE IS NOT WORSHIPFUL FOR THAT IT IS HARMFUL AND PROFITETH NOT SAVE IN COOKING FOOD ASKED RUSTAM WHO THEN IS WORSHIPFUL

AFTER WHICH HE LINGERED A FEW DAYS AND DEPARTED TO THE MERCY OF ALMIGHTY ALLAH
HALF A BOTTLE DOING THE WORK OF A WHOLE

AND NOW THOU NEEDST NOT FEAR FOR HIM DROWNING OR SUFFOCATION IN ALL THE OCEANS OF THE WORLD IF HE SHOULD GO DOWN INTO THEM
FOR AL-'ADIL THE NAME OF THE KING WHO LAID OUT THE MAYDAN
AFTER WHICH THEY FELL ON ONE ANOTHER AND THE SWORD WENT ROUND AMONGST THEM THREE DAYS TILL THERE ABODE ALIVE BUT TWO MEN ONE OF WHOM PREVAILED OVER THE OTHER AND KILLED HIM
MOREOVER HE MADE HIS UNCLE AL-DAMIGH KING OVER AL-IRAK AND ALL THE PEOPLES AND LANDS SUBMITTED THEMSELVES TO GHARIB
THOUGH HARD APPEAR MY HOPE TO WIN THOUGH LANGUOR AYE INCREASE AND AFTER THEE MY PATIENCE FAILS AND NE'ER A HELPER SHOWS
QUOTH I ALLAH ASSAIN THE EMIR
I REGRET TO SEE THE LITTLE HONOUR NOW PAID TO THE GALLANT POET IN THE LAND WHERE HE SHOULD BE HONOURED THE MOST
I PASSED THROUGH AL-AKIK IN JULY WHEN IT WAS DRY AS SUMMER DUST AND ITS BEAUTIFUL TREES WERE MERE VEGETABLE MUMMIES
WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND ELEVENTH NIGHT SHE RESUMED IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN AHMAD THE ABORTION HAD MADE KNOWN THE PLACE ALI LAID HOLD OF HIM AND WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE DINAR FROM HIM BUT COULD NOT

BUT I WILL TELL THEE SOMEWHAT WHEREIN ALLAH WILLING THERE SHALL BE PROFIT FOR THEE
SO TAKE THEM FROM THE PURSE-KEEPERESS AND KISS THE EARTH BEFORE THE KING'S DAUGHTER AND BLESS HER AND WEND THY WAY HEARING THESE WORDS HE TOOK THE GOLD AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE HAYAT AL-NUFUS CALLING DOWN BLESSINGS ON HER
SAWIK THE OLD AND MODERN NAME FOR NATIVE FRUMENTY GREEN GRAIN MOSTLY BARLEY TOASTED POUNDED MIXED WITH DATES OR SUGAR AND EATEN ON JOURNEYS WHEN COOKING IS IMPRACTICABLE

AS ALSO DID THE CITIZENS AND HE BESTOWED ON THEM SUMPTUOUS ROBES OF HONOUR AND COMMENDED THE RYOTS TO THEIR CARE

SO THERE IS NAUGHT FOR IT BUT PATIENCE TILL ALLAH DELIVER US FROM THIS OUR STRAIT REPLIED THE PRINCE THERE IS NO MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT

THE OLD WOMAN FEARING SCANDALOUS EXPOSURE CARRIED THEM BOTH INTO THE PAVILION AND SITTING DOWN AT THE DOOR SAID TO THE TWO WAITING-WOMEN SEIZE THE OCCASION TO TAKE YOUR PLEASURE IN THE GARDEN FOR THE PRINCESS SLEEPETH SO THEY RETURNED TO THEIR DIVERSION

WHEREFORE WE SAY THAT THEY BE TRUE MEN WHICH SPEAK SOOTH REJOINED MURA'ASH VERILY THE TRUTH HATH BEEN DISPLAYED TO ME AY AND THE MANIFEST WAY AND I AM CERTIFIED THAT THE WORSHIP OF THE FIRE IS FALSE
NOR DID THE MOSLEMS CEASE PURSUING THEM WITH THE SWORD TILL THEY HAD SCATTERED THEM ABROAD IN THE PLAINS AND STONY PLACES

THE WORD HAS ECHOED FAR WEST AND THE NAME OF THE NOBLE RACE HAS BEEN DEGRADED TO PHILISTER A BOURGEOIS A GREASY BURGHER
IT IS HIS WONT TO GO A RAIDING AND TO CUT OFF HIGHWAYS AND WAYLAY WAYFARERS AND HE IS A FURIOUS TYRANT
WHEREUPON HE QUESTIONED ONE OF THE SHEPHERDS SAYING WHAT BE ALL THIS

BY-AND-BY THE HEN-BIRD FELL INTO THE NET WHEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS TOOK FRIGHT AT HER AND FLEW AWAY AND HER HUSBAND FLEW WITH THEM AND DID NOT RETURN
SO SIT THEE DOWN AND TAKE THINE EASE AND HEARTEN THY HEART AND TELL ME WHAT HATH BETIDED THEE FROM BEGINNING TO END AND QUOTH HE I HEAR AND I OBEY SO HE FELL TO TELLING HER ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM FROM COMMENCEMENT TO CONCLUSION BUT WHEN SHE HEARD SPEAK OF BADI'A AL-JAMAL HER EYES RAN OVER WITH RAILING TEARS AND SHE CRIED O BADI'A AL-JAMAL I HAD NOT THOUGHT THIS OF THEE
AND BEFORE HE COULD RECOVER HIMSELF THE INDIANS PINIONED HIM AND HALED HIM OFF TO THEIR TENTS
BUT IT MISSED HIM AND FELL UPON A BUTTRESS OF THE PALACE AND SMOTE OUT THREE STONES
AND WHEN MORNING MORROWED THE YOUNG MAN AROSE AS WAS HIS WONT BEFORE SUNRISE AND WAKING SAYF AL-MULUK SAID TO HIM PUT THY HEAD FORTH OF THIS LATTICE AND SEE WHAT STANDETH BENEATH IT SO HE PUT OUT HIS HEAD AND SAW THE WIDE WASTE AND ALL THE WOLD FILLED WITH APES WHOSE NUMBER NONE KNEW SAVE ALLAH ALMIGHTY

I GROAN WI THE GROANING OF WINE-WOUNDED MEN AND PINE FOR THE PINING NE'ER FREETH MY HEART AND BY ALLAH MESEEMED THE DOORS AND THE WALLS AND ALL THAT WAS IN THE HOUSE ANSWERED AND SANG WITH HIM FOR THE BEAUTY OF HIS VOICE SO THAT I FANCIED MY VERY LIMBS AND CLOTHES REPLIED TO HIM AND I ABODE AMAZED AND UNABLE TO SPEAK OR MOVE FOR THE TROUBLE OF MY HEART
THERE WAS ONCE IN DAYS OF YORE AND IN AGES AND TIMES LONG GONE BEFORE A KING OF THE KINGS OF THE PERSIANS BY NAME MOHAMMED BIN SABAIK WHO RULED OVER KHORASAN-LAND AND USED EVERY YEAR TO GO ON RAZZIA INTO THE COUNTRIES OF THE MISCREANTS IN HIND AND SIND AND CHINA AND THE LANDS OF MAWARANNAHR BEYOND THE OXUS AND OTHER REGIONS OF THE BARBARIANS AND WHAT NOT ELSE
SO TAKE MY ADVICE AND HIE THEE THIS VERY DAY TO THE KEEPER OF THAT GARDEN AND MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM AND GAIN HIS GOOD GRACES FOR HE ADMITTETH NOT ONE OF ALLAH'S CREATURES INTO THE GARTH BECAUSE OF ITS COMMUNICATION WITH THE PRINCESS'S PALACE
AFTER WHICH HE CRIED OUT SAYING HO
SO ZAYNAB SAID TO HER MOTHER UP AND PLAY OFF SOME FEINT AND FRAUD THAT MAY HAPLY MAKE US NOTORIOUS"--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY

SO BY THE VIRTUE OF MY FAITH I WILL NOT SIT DOWN ON MY THRONE TILL I HAVE DECAPITATED THIS GHARIB AND SUPPRESSED HIS BREATH OF LIFE AND FORCED MY COUSIN AND HIS PEOPLE BACK TO THEIR BELIEF
SO HE RODE WITH HIS MEN AFTER THE ROBBERS TILL HE OVERTOOK THEM AND FELL UPON THEM CRYING OUT AND SAYING ALMIGHTY ALLAH UPON THE REBEL THE TRAITOR THE INFIDEL AND HE SLEW IN A SINGLE CHARGE ONE-AND-TWENTY FIGHTING MEN

MY BROTHER HATH WRONGED ME AND GOTTEN THE MASTERY OF THE LAND AND THE SUBJECTS HAVE SUBMITTED THEMSELVES TO HIM
THEN SHE SAID TO THE OLD WOMAN O MY NURSE WHENCE CAME YONDER HANDSOME YOUTH

WHEN THE CHINAMEN HEARD OF THE COMING OF FORTY SHIPS FULL OF ARMED MEN AND STORES WEAPONS AND HOARDS THEY MADE SURE THAT THESE WERE ENEMIES COME TO BATTLE WITH THEM AND SEIGE THEM

GHARIB REJOICED IN THEM AND SAID TO THEM O FOLK RETURN TO YOUR PEOPLE AND EXPOUND AL-ISLAM TO THEM BUT ALL REPLIED O OUR LORD WE WILL NEVER LEAVE THEE WHILST
WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FIRST NIGHT SHE CONTINUED IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE KING'S WIFE SAID TO THE KING VERILY THIS IS NO BIRD BUT A MAN LIKE THYSELF

HE SOJOURNED WITH HIS BROTHER A WEEK AFTER WHICH HE TOOK HIS DAUGHTER AND SAYF AL-MULUK AND RETURNED TO SARANDIB WHERE THE PRINCESS FOREGATHERED WITH HER MOTHER AND THEY REJOICED AT HER SAFE RETURN
THEN THE EUNUCH CARRIED THE BIRD TO THE PALACE AND PLACING HIM IN A FINE CAGE HUNG HIM UP AFTER SETTING MEAT AND DRINK BY HIM
THEN HE RETURNED TO HIS HOUSE AND HIS FAMILY REJOICED IN HIM AND BLESSED HIM[FN#285 WHO HAD BEEN THE PRIME CAUSE OF THIS BUSINESS.--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
ANSWERED THEY O KING TIS ONLY THE ELEPHANTS AND GIRAFFES THAT IRK US
AS SOON AS IT WAS MORNING JALAND MOUNTED WITH TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY-THOUSAND FIGHTING-MEN CLAD CAP-A-PIE IN HAUBERKS AND CUIRASSES AND STRAIT-KNIT MAIL-COATS THE KETTLE-DRUMS BEAT A POINT OF WAR AND ALL DREW OUT FOR CUT AND THRUST AND FIGHT AND FRAY
FOR SHE IS PRIME IN COMELINESS AND SEEMLIHEAD OF FACE AND SYMMETRICAL SHAPE OF PERFECT GRACE
AND WHEN HE DREW NEAR GHARIB HE CRIED OUT TO HIM SAYING O DOG OF MANKIND WHAT MADE THEE COME INTO OUR LAND TO DEBAUCH MY COUSIN AND HIS FOLK AND PERVERT THEM FROM ONE FAITH TO OTHER FAITH
AND THE LITTLE ONE GREW UP AND FLOURISHED WHILST HIS MATERNAL UNCLE AND GRANDAM AND COUSINS VISITED THE KING EVERY FEW DAYS AND ABODE WITH HIM A MONTH OR TWO MONTHS AT A TIME
BUT PRESENTLY PEERING AFAR INTO THE DESERT I ESPIED A FIRE IN ITS MIDDLE DEPTH
AFTER WHICH SHE SET THREE DINARS IN THE MOUTH AND STOPPED IT UP WITH A PLUG OF PALM-FIBRE
BUT HE WAITED TILL NIGHTFALL WHEN THE MOSLEMS HAD PITCHED THEIR TENTS FOR REST
SAID I TO MYSELF HE'S DROWNED IN SLEEP
I WILL SLAVE FOR YOU NO LONGER THEN SAID THE SLAVES TO HIM WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THEE O OUR COUSIN CRIED DALILAH THIS IS NONE OF YOUR UNCLE'S CHILDREN BUT ALI ZAYBAK THE EGYPTIAN
THE HALL KEEPER ADMITTED HIM AND AS HE ENTERED HASAN SHUMAN ASKED HIM WHAT BRINGETH THEE HERE HE ANSWERED DO YE INTERCEDE WITH ALI THE CAIRENE TO RESTORE ME MY CHILD AND I WILL YIELD TO HIM THE PURSE OF GOLD QUOTH HASAN ALLAH REQUITE THEE O ALI
SO STAND ON THY GUARD AGAINST HIM GHARIB SLEPT NOT THE REST OF THE NIGHT AND WHEN THE DAY BROKE HE CALLED FOR HIS COURSER AND MOUNTED
BUT TWAS TOO LARGE FOR ME SO I STRAITENED IT WITH WAX AND WHEN I LET DOWN THE BUCKET,[FN#231 THAT RING MUST HAVE DROPPED INTO THE WELL
KAANNAHU HUWA
THEN HE SALLIED FORTH AGAIN AND WALKED TILL HE CAME TO THE ROAD CALLED RED WHILST THE PEOPLE LEFT THE STREET CLEAR BEFORE HIM OUT OF FEAR OF HIM
IT IS SUPPOSED TO CAUSE A DISTASTE FOR SOCIETY AND A LONGING FOR SOLITUDE AN UNSETTLED HABIT OF MIND AND NEGLECT OF WORLDLY AFFAIRS

AFTER WHICH SHE ROSE AND DRAWING WATER FROM THE WELL POURED IT FROM THE EWER OVER HIS HANDS WHILST HE WASHED THEM
IF MULE IT BUT RESULTS FROM MULISH RULE."[FN#95 WHEN AL-HAJJAJ HEARD THIS HE TURNED BACK AND WENT HIS WAY UNSEEN OF HIND
BUT IT MISSED HIM AND FELL ON THE HEAD OF A GROOM WHO WAS PASSING BY FOLLOWING HIS MASTER A TROOPER AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN
ASKED THE WATER-CARRIER WHY DOST THOU NOT DRINK
WHEN HE DREW NEAR THE CITY IKRIMAH AND THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE CAME FORTH TO MEET HIM AND THEY SALUTED EACH OTHER AND WENT ON INTO THE TOWN WHERE KHUZAYMAH TOOK UP HIS LODGING IN THE GOVERNMENT-HOUSE AND BADE TAKE SECURITY FOR IKRIMAH AND THAT HE SHOULD BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT.[FN#107 SO AN ACCOUNT WAS TAKEN AGAINST HIM AND HE WAS FOUND TO BE IN DEFAULT FOR MUCH MONEY

AFTER WHICH THEY SET ON FINE SUGAR AND NIGH FORTY FLAGONS IN EACH A DIFFERENT KIND OF WINE AND THEY DRANK AND TOOK THEIR PLEASURE AND MADE MERRY AND HAD A FINE TIME
WHEN IT WAS THE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FOURTH NIGHT SHE PURSUED IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN GHARIB AND KING MURA'ASH RODE FORTH THE PALACE OF JAPHET WITH MEN AND JINNS ATTENDING THEM ON FOOT THEY PASSED THROUGH THE STREETS AND THOROUGHFARES OF THE TOWN BY PALACES AND DESERTED MANSIONS AND GILDED DOORWAYS TILL THEY ISSUED FROM THE GATES AND ENTERED GARDENS FULL OF TREES FRUIT-BEARING AND WATERS WELLING AND BIRDS SPEAKING AND CELEBRATING THE PRAISES OF HIM TO WHOM BELONG MAJESTY AND ETERNITY

THEN THEY SET OUT FOR CUFA WHERE GHARIB CALLED FOR HIS BROTHER AJIB AND COMMANDED TO HANG HIM
SHE LED IN THE PRINCE AND HE CEASED NOT FOLLOWING HER FROM DOOR TO DOOR AND THE PROTECTOR PROTECTED THEM SO THAT THEY PASSED ALL THE GUARDS TILL THEY CAME TO THE SEVENTH DOOR
ITS NAIVE AND STRIKING PICTURE OF CONJUGAL AFFECTION GOES FAR TO REDEEM THE GROSSNESS OF THE NIGHTS
I COMMEND THEE TO HIM WITH WHOM DEPOSITS ARE NOT LOST."[FN#393 SO THE PRINCE BADE ADIEU TO HIS PARENTS AND EMBARKED WITH HIS BROTHER SA'ID AND THEY WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SAILED TILL THEY CAME TO THE CITY OF CHINA

THEN HAVE RUTH ON THE VITALS THY LOVE HATH SEARED AND THE HEART THAT FLIES TO THY SIDE THE MO'E AND WHEN SHE ENDED HER RECITATION PASSION OVERCAME HER AND SHE WAS DISTRAUGHT FOR LOVE AND WEPT COPIOUS TEARS RAIN-LIKE STREAMING DOWN

WHEREFORE I PURPOSE TO CARRY HER FATHER A GIFT OF JACINTHS AND JEWELS BEFITTING HIS DIGNITY AND DEMAND HER OF HIM IN MARRIAGE
PASSION ANNIHILATED HIS RIGHT JUDGMENT AND LOVE OVERPASSED ALL LIMITS IN HIM
INSHALLAH IF I BECOME A CAPTAIN TO THE CALIPH I WILL MAKE THEE ONE OF MY LADS THEN THE BOY MADE OFF AND ALI ZAYBAK WENT UP TO THE DOOR AND KNOCKED
WHEN SHE WAS GONE PASSION AND LOVE-LONGING REDOUBLED UPON THE YOUNG PRINCE AND THE DELIGHT OF SLEEP WAS FORBIDDEN HIM AND THE PRINCESS IN HER TURN TASTED NOT FOOD AND HER PATIENCE FAILED AND SHE SICKENED FOR DESIRE
WHICH DOES THOU CHOOSE
MEANWHILE GHARIB'S HOST WHEN THEY AWOKE THAT MORNING AND FOUND NOT THEIR KING WERE AS SHEEP SANS A SHEPHERD

THEN THEY ISSUED FORTH IN A BODY AND RENEWED THEIR ISLAM BEFORE KING GHARIB WHO REJOICED IN THEM WITH EXCEEDING JOY AND HIS BREAST BROADENED AND HE THREW OFF ALL ANNOY
NOW IT CHANCED THAT ONE DAY THERE CAME AN OLD MAN BEFORE HIM AND RELATED TO HIM A RARE STORY WHICH PLEASED THE KING AND MADE HIM MARVEL SO HE ORDERED HIM A MAGNIFICENT PRESENT AMONGST OTHER THINGS A THOUSAND DINARS OF KHORASAN AND A HORSE WITH ITS HOUSINGS AND TRAPPINGS

MOREOVER THE CITY WOULD BE LEFT WITHOUT KING AND THERE WOULD BE NONE TO GOVERN THE CITIZENS AND LOOK TO THEIR AFFAIRS SO SHOULD THE REALM BE DISORDERED AGAINST THEE AND THE KINGSHIP DEPART FROM THY HANDS BUT BADR BASIM HEARING THESE WORDS CRIED O MY UNCLE IF I RETURN TO MY MOTHER AND CONSULT HER ON SUCH MATTER SHE WILL NOT SUFFER ME TO DO THIS
NOW THE FIRST TO OPEN THE GATE OF WAR WAS KING AL-DAMIGH WHO URGED HIS CHARGER BETWEEN THE TWO OPPOSING ARMIES AND DISPLAYED HIMSELF AND PLAYED WITH THE SWORDS AND THE SPEARS TILL BOTH HOSTS WERE CONFOUNDED AND AT HIM MARVELLED AFTER WHICH HE CRIED OUT SAYING WHO IS FOR JOUSTING

IT CHANCED THAT WHILE PASSING ON MY WAY I SAW THEE AND FELL IN LOVE WITH THEE FOR THY LOVELY FORM
AND WHEN HE AWOKE AFTER LONG SLUMBERING HE SAW THE SHE-PIGEON CAUGHT IN THE NET
WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS HIS DOOM-DAY APPEARED TO HIM AND HE ASSEMBLED HIS BRAVES AND INFORMING THEM OF THE ENEMY'S APPROACH ORDERED THEM MAKE READY TO DO BATTLE WITH HIS BROTHER'S HOST

THESE WERE THE COMPANIONS OF ZAMRAH WHO WERE BEGGING HER TO RETURN TO HIM
NOW THE CAUSE OF THIS WAS THAT TEN DAYS AFTER HIS NEPHEW KING AL-DAMIGH GHARIB'S UNCLE HAD SET OUT FROM AL-JAZIRAH WITH TWENTY-THOUSAND HORSE AND ON NEARING THE FIELD OF BATTLE HAD DESPATCHED ONE OF HIS SCOUTS TO GET NEWS
WHEN THE PRINCESS REJOINED GO LOOK AT THE UPPER END OF THE ESTRADE AND TELL ME WHAT THOU SEEST THERE SO SHE WENT UP AND CONSIDERED THE DREAM-DRAWING
NA'I AL-MAUT THE PERSON SENT ROUND TO ANNOUNCE A DEATH TO THE FRIENDS AND RELATIONS OF THE DECEASED AND INVITE THEM TO THE FUNERAL

AND THUS HE LAVISHED HIS GIFTS TEN DAYS LONG
AND REPAIRING TO THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT FOUND THE DOOR LOCKED AND THE OLD WOMAN ASLEEP BEFORE THE THRESHOLD
NONE SHALL DO IT SAVE I SO HE PUT OFF HIS CLOTHES AND TIED THE ROPE ABOUT HIMSELF AND SHE LET HIM DOWN INTO THE WELL
HE WAS A KURD AND THEREFORE FOND OF BOYS LIKE VIRGIL HORACE ETC BUT THAT PERVERSION DID NOT PREY PREVENT HIS BEING ONE OF THE NOBLEST OF MEN
WHILST FOR THE SECOND AN IMAGE OF DREAMS CAME TO HER IN SLEEP AND SHE SALUTED IT
BUT WHEN THE PEOPLE SAW HIM THEY ACCOSTED THE GROCER AND SAID TO HIM O ELDER IS THIS THY CAPTIVE AND THY PREY GOTTEN IN THESE DAYS THE OLD MAN REPLIED HE IS MY BROTHER'S SON I HEARD THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD

WHICH WHEN SAYF AL-MULUK SAW HE MARVELLED AT THEM AND FORGOT THAT WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIM OF SUFFERINGS.--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
THEN HE CAUSED THE SCRIBES WRITE THE STORY IN LETTERS OF GOLD AND LAY IT UP IN HIS PRIVY TREASURES
THE CALIPH HARUN AL-RASHID WAS WALKING ONE DAY WITH JA'AFAR THE BARMECIDE WHEN HE ESPIED A COMPANY OF GIRLS DRAWING WATER AND WENT UP TO THEM HAVING A MIND TO DRINK
RETURN TO RIGHTEOUS COURSE

BUT AGAINST DEATH THERE IS NO RECOURSE NOR O MY LADY IS THERE AUGHT IN THE WORLD MORE TENDERLY SOLICITOUS THAN THE MALE FOR THE FEMALE AMONG ALL CREATURES WHICH ALMIGHTY ALLAH HATH CREATED
