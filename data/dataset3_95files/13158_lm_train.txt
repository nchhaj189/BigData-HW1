THE VINE-COVERED HILLS ALTHOUGH NOT YET CLOTHED WITH THEIR GREEN GARMENT WERE STILL BEAUTIFUL WHILE AWAY IN THE DISTANCE SPREAD A BROAD ITALIAN PLAIN DOTTED WITH VILLAGES OUT OF WHOSE MIDST A MODEST CHURCH SPIRE EVER LIFTED ITS HEAD
HE INTENDED ME TO KILL YOU WHILE BOTH OF YOU TRIED TO RUIN ME CURSE HIM
WHITHER HER PURE TRUE HEART LED HER SHE FOLLOWED
I RUSHED AWAY AND GOT INTO ST JAMES'S PARK AND THERE IN COMPARATIVE QUIETNESS I BEGAN TO THINK
I AM A WOMAN SO I BEGAN TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
BE MY WIFE MISS FORREST
THAT'S SCRIPTER
THE TWO ROOMS LIKE MANY WE FIND IN FRENCH HOTELS COULD EASILY BE MADE ONE AS A DOORWAY LED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
STAY THOUGH
HE DARE NOT COME
MAY I CLAIM YOUR PARDON YOUR FORGIVENESS HE SAID
WHY SHOULD ANY EXCEPTION BE MADE FOR ME
HIS NATURE HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY PREPARED FOR SUCH WORK
YOU HAVE EXPRESSED YOUR WANT OF FAITH IN OUR POWER
THERE THE COLD WINDS SCARCELY EVER BLOW AND THE PEOPLE'S HEARTS ARE WARM I SUPPOSE SO THERE ARE MYSTERIES THERE AS IN TEMPLE HALL MR BLAKE
SHE MADE THE GHOST VERY REAL TO MANY AND THE CALAMITY WHICH SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO FORETELL SEEMED CERTAIN TO COME TO PASS
IT WAS THE WIRGIN STAGGLES AND THIS ERE WOLTAIRE
ONE WISHES HE HAD LIVED THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN HE STANDS AMONG THOSE ANCIENT PILES
THERE VILLAIN I SAID IS THE MAN WHOM YOU SAY I'VE MURDERED HOW DARE YOU COME HERE SAID VOLTAIRE TO KAFFAR
NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE HAPPENED BETWEEN THE 18TH AND THE 24TH AND EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE LATTER DATE I FOUND MY WAY TO ST PANCRAS STATION AND BOOKED FOR THE STATION NEAREST TOM TEMPLE'S HOME
I LEAVE THIS HOUSE
I HAVE BEEN VERY FOOLISH VERY UNJUST
SHE'S VERY CLEAR-HEADED SHARP AND CLEVER
THINK AS YOU WILL BUT SHE CAN NEVER BE YOURS
THE TRUTH WAS IT HAD GONE AROUND THAT MR VOLTAIRE WAS GOING TO TELL US A STORY CONCERNING THE MYSTIC RITES THAT ARE PRACTISED IN EASTERN LANDS AND THE SUBJECT WAS AN ATTRACTIVE ONE
AS FOR HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS I KNEW BUT LITTLE ABOUT THEM BUT I JUDGED FROM THE LETTERS HIS MOTHER WROTE HIM WHEN AT SCHOOL THAT SHE MUST BE A TRUE KIND-HEARTED MOTHERLY WOMAN
AND SO I ALLAYS SAY AS OW WACCINATION IS MY RUIN
VOLTAIRE KAFFAR TOM TEMPLE AND SIMON SLOWDEN WERE IN THE ROOM
I BECAME ALMOST MAD WITH DESPAIR
WHAT WAS DONE WAS NOT BECAUSE OF ME BUT BECAUSE OF THE DEMON THAT CAUSED ME BLINDLY TO ACT NAMES ARE CHEAP MY MAN AND I DON'T MIND
BUT I HAD NOT TIME TO ASK HER FOR TWO YOUNG MEN CAME INTO THE ROOM
OH SIR SAID THE PROPRIETRESS OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT DON'T GO THERE
WITHOUT HESITATING SIMON DREW A SKETCH A FACSIMILE OF WHICH IS GIVEN ON THE OPPOSITE PAGE
MY LIFE FOR DAYS HAS BEEN A HELL
HE CAN TURN IT TO HIS ADVANTAGE I REPLIED
SOME CLEVER FELLOW HAS INVENTED A CLEVER SYSTEM FOR ASKING AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND THOSE WHO HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO LEARN IT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DECEIVE A CREDULOUS PUBLIC VOLTAIRE'S EYES FLASHED FIRE
NOT SO FAST HE SNEERED
SHE IS A FLOWER IN HERSELF
THEY WERE OF AN EXTREMELY LIGHT GREY AND WERE TINTED WITH A KIND OF GREEN
THEY ARE DOUBTLESS WEARISOME ENOUGH AND YET THEY WERE TERRIBLY REAL TO ME ALTHOUGH I HAVE USED BUT A FEW PAGES OF PAPER IN HINTING AT THEM THEY CAUSED ME TO LIE AWAKE THROUGH MANY A WEARY NIGHT
IT WAS A TERRIBLE STRUGGLE
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIM AND WITH HIS FRIEND THE EGYPTIAN AS WELL DON'T SHE SAID ANXIOUSLY
THERE WAS ONE TURK ONE FRENCHMAN TWO ITALIANS AND ONE EGYPTIAN MY HEART GAVE A GREAT BOUND
NEED I TELL HOW I HAD TO RECOUNT MY DOINGS AND JOURNEYINGS OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN WHILE SIMON AND KAFFAR WERE ASKED TO GIVE SUCH INFORMATION AS I WAS UNABLE TO GIVE AND HOW ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WAS EXPLAINED BY ANOTHER UNTIL ALL WAS PLAIN
AS YET I COULD DO NOTHING
I ACCUSED HIM GENTLEMEN OF BEING CONNECTED WITH THIS GHOST ONLY TO-DAY AND HE FLUSHED GUILTILY AND WAS SILENT
EVEN NOW YOU CANNOT RISE FROM YOUR SEAT AND WALK ACROSS THE ROOM WITHOUT A WORD I ROSE FROM MY SEAT AND WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM
CERTAINLY THERE IS ENOUGH ROMANCE AND MYSTERY IN YOUR STORY TO SATISFY ANY ONE
PRESENTLY I HEARD SOME ONE SPEAK
DO YOU SEE KAFFAR THE EGYPTIAN I WAITED IN BREATHLESS SILENCE FOR THE ANSWER
BY AND BY THE GREAT BUILDING SEEMED TO ASSUME ITS ORIGINAL SHAPE AND BECAME INHABITED BY WHITE-ROBED PRIESTS WHO MINISTERED TO THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO WORSHIP
AH I THOUGHT SO SAID HE CUNNINGLY
TO BE AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN WITH AN ENTREE INTO THE BEST ENGLISH SOCIETY IS WHAT I HAVE LONG LONGED FOR
USING THE ENEMY'S WEAPONS XVIII
I'LL WIN I'LL WIN OR--OR HERE HE PAUSED AS IF A THOUGHT STRUCK HIM
MR KAFFAR WILL HAVE SUPPER I SUPPOSE I SAID TO THE PROPRIETOR OF THE HOUSE
I WILL ANSWER FOR MR BLAKE'S INNOCENCE YOU ANSWER MISS FORREST CRIED VOLTAIRE
I REMEMBERED THE TERRIBLE INFLUENCE HE HAD EXERCISED OVER ME THE POWER OF WHICH MIGHT NOT YET BE BROKEN
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MAY HAPPEN AND YOU MUST NOT BE DEFRAUDED
I WAS TOO ANXIOUS TO GET TO THIS HOTEL WHERE I HOPED KAFFAR WOULD BE STAYING
DOUBTLESS I HAD GONE CLUMSILY TO WORK AND THUS MY FAILURE WOULD BE EXPLAINED
TELL ME THE TRUTH EVEN VOLTAIRE WAS COWED BY HER WORDS
NEVER DID I BELIEVE SUCH VILLAINY POSSIBLE
SHE STILL HAD AN INTEREST IN ME
IF A POOR EASTERN CANNOT HAVE LOVE HE CAN STILL HAVE VENGEANCE HE SAID
AND YOU SEE ALL YOUR DETECTIVE CHAPS HAVE FAILED BUT I SHAN'T FAIL IF YOU'LL HELP ME HELP YOU MR BLAKE
I HAVE AN INDISTINCT KIND OF FEELING THAT BOTH HE AND THE EGYPTIAN ARE DECEIVERS WHILE I AM SURE THAT MR VOLTAIRE IS--IS YOUR ENEMY I HAVE NO DOUBT HE IS I SAID
I COULD HAVE BELIEVED IN EITHER JUST THEN
THERE WERE TWO PLATFORMS IN THE STATION AND A REFRESHMENT ROOM
IT CERTAINLY SEEMED FOOLISH AND YET I COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA OF HIS BEING THE COMPANION OF GERTRUDE FORREST
AND YET THE LITTLE MAN SEEMED HONEST
YES KAFFAR
KAFFAR WAS NOT A MARKED MAN HERE
THEN I HAVE NOT KILLED HIM EVEN THROUGH YOU
ESPECIALLY WAS IT SO IN MY CASE OWING TO THE FACT THAT AT TWENTY-ONE I INHERITED A CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE
YOURS CRIED MISS FORREST'S AUNT
I HAD LIVED MY THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT EVER BEING IN LOVE
IF YOU DO--WELL YOU KNOW MY POWER FROM THAT MOMENT I FELT MORE ENSLAVED THAN EVER
IF I AM I DO NOT FEAR
NOW HE WOULD BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING I COULD DO
GO ON HEROD HE SAID
I DO NOT KNOW BUT THAT I AM GLAD THAT THINGS ARE AS THEY ARE CONTINUED THE PROFESSOR
WAS ALL THIS MESMERISM SO MUCH HOCUS-POCUS AND NONSENSE TO DECEIVE ME A CREDULOUS FOOL
ONLY ONE THING MARRED MY HAPPINESS
THREE MONTHS PASSED
THIS IS BECOMING INTERESTING I SAID
ONLY A VERY FEW OF THE PARTY FOUND THEIR WAY TO THE OLD TIME-HONOURED BUILDING TO JOIN IN THE CHRISTMAS SERVICE THAT MORNING
AH CRIED VOLTAIRE LOVE IS A STRONGER PASSION THAN VENGEANCE AND MY LOVE WILL WIN YOURS MEANWHILE SHE WENT ON WITHOUT NOTICING THIS RHAPSODY IF YOU BREATHE ONE WORD OR UTTER ONE SOUND BY WHICH SUSPICION CAN FALL ON MR BLAKE MY PROMISE IS FORFEITED
SURELY YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN HIS FOOLISH STORY OR CONJURING TRICKS I SAID LAUGHINGLY
BY THE FOLLOWING WEDNESDAY AT MIDNIGHT I MUST PROVE TO GERTRUDE THAT VOLTAIRE WAS A VILLAIN AND A LIAR
NO NOT FOR MY SAKE
IT WAS A YOUNG LADY UNDER THE ORDINARY SIZE AND FROM WHAT I COULD SEE OF HER POSSESSED OF MORE THAN ORDINARY BEAUTY
NOT THAT I DESERVED THE APPELLATION
A HEAVY LOAD IS GONE FROM MY HEART
THE TRUTH WAS AND I FELT SURE OF IT AS I RODE ALONG I WAS PARTLY MESMERIZED OR HYPNOTIZED WHATEVER MEN MAY PLEASE TO CALL IT
BOTHER IT I MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND SO I SUPPOSE I AM TO HAVE SOME FIDGETY OLD WOMEN FOR MY TRAVELLING COMPANIONS THE READER WILL IMAGINE FROM THIS THAT I WAS NOT A LADY'S MAN
I WATCHED EAGERLY BUT THEY FADED AWAY LEAVING NOTHING SAVE THE FEELING THAT A TERRIBLE PRESENCE FILLED THE PLACE
I HAD COME DOWN AS USUAL AND ENTERING THE LIBRARY I FOUND MISS FORREST SEATED
I HEARD THE POSTMAN'S KNOCK AND IN A MINUTE MORE LETTERS WERE BROUGHT IN
I CAUGHT HIM AND HELD HIM FAST
I WAS BY THE SIDE OF DREARWATER POND
I MIGHT WITH MY OWN HAND HAVE SENT A MAN INTO ETERNITY
NEVERTHELESS IT DID SO I PUT ON MY OVERCOAT AND WENT AWAY IN THE DIRECTION OF HYDE PARK IN ORDER IF POSSIBLE TO DISPEL MY FANCIES
I HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE I BEGAN TO QUESTION THE WISDOM OF WHAT I WAS DOING
BUT THAT COULD NOT BE
THINK IF YOU CAN OF MY POSITION
IF I DID I WAS GUILTLESS OF CRIME
THERE ON THE DOOR WAS THE NAME OF THE MAN I HAD HOPED TO FIND--PROFESSOR VON VIRCHOW
HAD SHE BEEN NEAR HER HOME HER KNOWLEDGE WOULD HAVE DEFIED THE POWERS OF THIS MOST DEADLY SERPENT'S BITE
SUPPOSING BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE COMES I PROVE I AM INNOCENT OF HIS DEATH
HAVE YOU ONE I HAVE NOT COULD YOU OBTAIN ONE I THINK NOT BUT THIS MAN HAS BEEN SEEN BY MANY PEOPLE
EVIDENTLY THIS WAS A KEEN YOUTH TRYING TO GET A SUITABLE CUSTOMER FOR HIS RELATIONS
IN ENGLAND THE STREETS WERE MUDDY AND A YELLOW FOG HUNG OVER LONDON AND YET IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS WE WERE BENEATH SUNNY SKIES WE WERE BREATHING A COMPARATIVELY HUMID AIR
GOD XV
BUT SUCH IS MY BELIEF IN MR BLAKE'S INNOCENCE THAT I PROMISE YOU THIS
IT IS NOT FOR THE EYES OF THE WORLD TO SEE
WELL GENTLEMEN HE WACCINATED ME AND I SAID TO UN NEVER NO MORE YER HONOUR WHY ASKED I
BESIDES WOULD HE GAMBLE IN PARIS A CITY OF WHICH HE KNEW NOTHING
SINCE THEN I'VE GUV UP THE TENDER PASSION AND GUV UP WRITIN LETTERS WELL YOU HAVE HAD BAD LUCK SIMON
AND IF YOU DON'T LEAVE THAT ERE COACHMAN AND SMILE ON ME I SHALL EITHER GO UP LIKE A BALOON OR ELSE THERE'LL BE A CASE OF COMBUSTION I WENT ON IN THAT ERE STYLE YER KNOW THINKIN SHE'D MELT LIKE A H'YSTER IN A FRYIN'-PAN BUT SHE DIDN'T
HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME HERE TO TELL ME THAT NO
ONWARD IT SAID AND I BECAME UNCONSCIOUS
SHOULD SHE HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SELLING ME SOME
IF YOU SUCCEED SHE SAID I WILL BE YOUR WIFE BUT NOT SIMPLY FROM A FEELING OF PITY I CRIED
HOWAJJA HEROD HE SAID TO ME I AM FIRST GOING TO USE ONE OF OUR OLD MEANS OF GETTING KNOWLEDGE
CHAPTER II CHRISTMAS EVE JUST BEFORE I REACHED THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR MRS TEMPLE CAME UP AND TOOK ME BY THE ARM
SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO SPEAK WHEN A VOICE SHOUTED COME JUSTIN
THE MONTHS ARE SWIFTLY PASSING AWAY MR JUSTIN BLAKE
YOU'VE BEEN TRAVELLING ALL NIGHT AND ARE A LITTLE TIRED I EXPECT
DO IT FOR MY SAKE I COULD NOT HELP FEELING A GREAT THROB OF JOY IN MY HEART AT THIS
I FOUND THE MAN AND YET I HAD NOT
NEVER MIND OUR DAY WILL COME
ALL THE KNOWLEDGE AND POWER OF MY LIFE ARE TO BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE ACT WITH THAT HE LOOKED AT HELFA WHO STAGGERED TO A LOW CUSHION
TO-MORROW THE WHOLE COUNTRY SHALL SHUDDER BECAUSE OF THIS DARK DEED AND TO-MORROW NIGHT THAT MAN JUSTIN BLAKE SHALL SLEEP IN A FELON'S CELL NO NO SHE CRIED
SHE SPOKE AS IF SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE ME AND WANTED ME TO KNOW IT
AY AND THE HATEFUL GLITTER OF VOLTAIRE'S EYES WAS REAL TOO
WE AGAIN QUESTIONED THE SERVANTS BUT WITH THE SAME RESULT AND THEN WE WENT QUIETLY UP-STAIRS
THE QUARTER OF AN HOUR DRAGGED SLOWLY AWAY WHEN THE SALLOW-FACED GIRL AGAIN APPEARED SAYING THAT PROFESSOR VON VIRCHOW WOULD BE PLEASED TO SEE ME
A YOUNG MAN OF THIRTY A SLAVE TO A DEEP DESIGNING VILLAIN HELD FAST IN HIS POWER BY SOME SECRET NERVOUS OR BRAIN FORCES WHICH HE POSSESSED
WHO ARE YOU DEMANDED VOLTAIRE
I HAD TO DO AS HE TOLD ME
I BEGAN TO BE POSSESSED OF A POWER WHEREBY I COULD CONQUER MYSELF SUBJUGATE MY OWN WILL AND BE MASTER OVER MY PASSIONS
IT'S NINE O'CLOCK JUSTIN YES TOM I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE I SAID CONFUSEDLY
OF MR VOLTAIRE'S POWER UNDOUBTEDLY COME SAID KAFFAR MR BLAKE IS STILL A SCEPTIC
FIRST YOU COULD NOT THEN HAVE ANY REASON FOR SUSPECTING A COLLUSION
MUST I GIVE UP THEN
SO I WENT STRAIGHT TO A PRIVATE DETECTIVE A MAN I SLIGHTLY KNEW
AS THEY CAME NEAR ME I MADE A SLIGHT NOISE WHICH DREW THEIR ATTENTION
INSTANTLY I LEAPT TO MY FEET
THIS WAS TRUE FURTHER BECAUSE ALL EVIL WAS IN OPPOSITION TO THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE AND THUS THE GOOD MUST OVERCOME THE EVIL
THEY ARE GOING TO ASK YOU TO JOIN THEM
THE TOWN WAS FULL OF SQUARES AND IN THESE SQUARES WERE MANY STATUES
NOT MORE THAN THIRTY-FIVE
SHE KEPT BY THE SIDE OF EDITH GRAY IN SPITE OF ALL MY SCHEMES TO GET HER BY MINE
BESIDES I THOUGHT AS OW YOU WER THE ONE THAT OUGHT TO KNOW FIRST OF ALL I THOUGHT LONG OVER SIMON'S WORDS BUT COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
I WOULD DIE FOR YOU I LOVE YOU SO
THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROOF FOR AN ENGLISH COURT OF LAW AND THAT LAW IS TERRIBLY HARD ON MURDERERS MURDERERS CRIED MISS FORREST
BY PURE PSYCHOLOGY I HAVE OBTAINED MY POWER OVER YOU
WE ARE INVITING A FEW FRIENDS TO SPEND CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR WITH US AND WE WISH YOU TO MAKE ONE OF THE NUMBER
YES I SAID I AM COME
HE HAD SET A COMMAND BEFORE ME WHICH WAS AS GHASTLY AS HELL AND YET I DARED NOT DISOBEY
MR BLAKE COULD NEVER NEVER DO SO
THIS SUDDEN FALLING INTO LOVE MAY APPEAR FOOLISH ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED THAT I HAD PASSED THE AGE OF BOYHOOD AND YET I HAVE KNOWN SEVERAL CASES SIMILAR TO MY OWN
HE HAD UTTERED NO WORD WHEN HE SAW ME BUT HE GAVE INDICATIONS OF HIS ASTONISHMENT
THEN I REALIZED A NEW EXPERIENCE
WORK WOULD BE A SLOW PROCESS AND NOT SUITED TO HIS NATURE
I WOULD GIVE THE WORLD IF I COULD
I FOLLOWED HER INTO AN APARTMENT THAT WAS FITTED UP LIKE A DOCTOR'S CONSULTING-ROOM
BUT YOUR AUNT HAD ONE POOR SILLY CREATURE AND SO FOR DUTY'S SAKE I AM BREAKING THE RULES OF ETIQUETTE
HOW I CANNOT TELL YOU
DO YOU FEEL SHAKY AND SHIVERY SIMON I ASKED
ACCORDINGLY I WENT TO ALL THE SEAPORTS ALONG THE COAST OF FRANCE AND ITALY FROM WHICH HE WOULD BE LIKELY TO SET SAIL FOR EGYPT
MY MIND REFUSED TO EXERCISE ITS PROPER FUNCTIONS
TELL ME WHAT IT IS
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
AND DO YOU MEAN TO SAY SUR THAT THAT ERE BEAUTIFUL MISS FORREST WHO I'VE PUT DOWN FOR YOU IS GOIN TO GIT MARRIED TO THAT ERE SOMNAMBLIFYIN WACCINATIN WILLAIN IF HIS DUTIFUL MATE AIN'T A FOUND BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE ONLY NINE DAYS SIMON BUT IT MUSTN'T BE YER HONOUR SO I SAY SIMON
I NEED NOT SAY THAT I DID NOT GO
YOU KNOW THAT MISS FORREST HAS PROMISED TO MARRY ME IF KAFFAR BE NOT FORTHCOMING BY NEXT CHRISTMAS EVE
TWO YOUNG ENGLISHMEN ALSO DECLARED THEMSELVES TO BE ABSTAINERS AND WANTED TO GO WITH ME WHILE HEROD VOLTAIRE LIKEWISE ASKED LEAVE TO ABIDE BY THE RULES HE HAD EVER FOLLOWED IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH HE HAD LIVED
HE HAD NOT STAYED AT ANY OF THE HOTELS
I COULD SPEAK THE FRENCH LANGUAGE FAIRLY AND MIGHT BY SOME MEANS FIND OUT THE STEPS HE HAD TAKEN
I STOOD ALONE
ENTER THY BODY THEN SPIRIT OF MY DAUGHTER AND TELL ME IF THOU DAREST THE SECRET I HAVE DESIRED SO LONG I LOOKED AT THE EMBALMED BODY
NO SOONER HAD THE PORTER LAID THE ARTICLES MENTIONED ON A CORNER SEAT THE ONE FARTHEST AWAY FROM ME THAN THEIR OWNER ENTERED AND MY IRRITATION VANISHED
I WOULD NOT GIVE UP HOWEVER
HOW TERRIBLE IT MUST BE TO HAVE TO OBEY THE SUMMONS OF THE DEVIL AND SO FIND OUT THE TRUTH THAT WHILE TWO IS COMPANY FIVE IS NONE I BEGAN TO TREMBLE AGAIN
CERTAINLY NOT
HAVE YOU FOUND HIM MR BLAKE IS SAFE IN BED BEFORE THIS MISS FORREST--PROBABLY ASLEEP WAS HIS REPLY MISS FORREST I CRIED
I DO NOT MIND TELLING YOU NOW FOR YOU DARE NOT SPEAK
YOU CAN SAVE ME FROM HIM OH I CRIED I KNOW I MUST APPEAR A PITIFUL COWARD TO YOU
I FELT THAT IF THIS MAN WAS TO BE FOUGHT IT MUST BE BY HIS OWN WEAPONS
THERE'S SURELY SOME TRICK IN THIS I SAID TO HER
I'M HIS MASTER FOR MANY REASONS--HE DARE NOT COME
FOR ALTHOUGH I HAD SUCCEEDED ALMOST BEYOND MY HOPES A GREAT FEAR RESTED UPON ME THAT I SHOULD FAIL EVEN YET
HE EVEN GREETED ME WITH A SNEER
I WOULD HAVE STAYED IN MY ROOM HAD I THOUGHT SO ON THE OTHER HAND I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU HERE
WAS NOT HEROD VOLTAIRE YOUR MASTER I WAS SILENT
WAS IT RIGHT TO STAND LISTENING THUS
I STOOD BENEATH THE RUINED WALLS OF AN EASTERN TEMPLE
YOU WILL BE DRAGGED THROUGH THE STREETS LIKE A COMMON FELON AM I GUILTY OF SO MUCH THEN I SAID
ON INQUIRY OF THE HOTEL PORTER I FOUND THAT HE CARRIED A GLADSTONE BAG RATHER SMALL AND NEW
I MEAN NO WRONG--TO YOU
HOWEVER I DO NOT WISH TO BIAS OTHER MINDS AND TRUST THAT MY SCEPTICISM MAY CAUSE NO UNPLEASANTNESS BUT WOULD MR BLAKE LIKE TO BE CONVINCED SAID VOLTAIRE
I WANTED TO TALK QUIETLY WITH TOM
SHE HAD SEEN YOU GO OUT AND WATCHED VOLTAIRE AND ME WHO WENT IN SEARCH OF YOU AND WOULD NOT RETIRE UNTIL SHE KNEW YOUR WHEREABOUTS WELL WHAT THEN I WENT INTO THE ROOM
THE SERVANTS ALONE IN THE HALL AT MIDNIGHT PERHAPS TALKING ABOUT THE TRADITIONAL GHOST COULD EASILY HAVE FRIGHTENED THEMSELVES INTO THE BELIEF THAT THEY HAD SEEN IT
AND FURTHER I WOULD DEFY HIM TO FIND OR PRODUCE SUCH A CODE OF QUESTIONS AS HE MENTIONS I IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE ROOM AND SOON AFTERWARDS RETURNED WITH A BOOK BY A RENOWNED THOUGHT-READER WHEREIN HE EXPLAINED WHAT TO SO MANY HAS APPEARED MARVELLOUS
PERHAPS SO
NO THE SOLDIER SAID HE DID NOT KNOW ANY AT ALL IN THAT STREET OR INDEED IN THAT PART OF THE TOWN
I TURNED TO FOLLOW THEM BUT THEY WERE GONE I KNEW NOT WHITHER AND SO I WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE DETERMINED THAT IF I COULD BE NOTHING ELSE I WOULD BE MISS FORREST'S PROTECTOR
THE ITALIAN LANGUAGE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER STRANGE TO ME
CHAPTER IV VOLTAIRE'S STORY OF THE EAST WHEN LUNCH-TIME CAME I TO MY DELIGHT OBTAINED A SEAT NEXT TO MISS FORREST AND SOON I BECAME OBLIVIOUS TO ALL ELSE BUT HER
AND THAT REMINDS ME JUSTIN SHE BADE ME TELL YOU THAT SHE WOULD BE IN HER OWN HOME AT KENSINGTON UNTIL AFTER THE NEXT NEW YEAR THIS MADE ME JOYFUL IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING
I HAD NO SOONER FINISHED BREAKFAST THAN I MET MISS FORREST AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH HER
I STOPPED THE MAN FOR I DID NOT WISH TO APPEAR IN THE WAY THAT MATTERS SEEMED TO PROMISE
I TRUST I AM NOT THE DISCIPLE OF EITHER THE MEN WHOSE NAME I BEAR
HURRAH I CRIED THERE THEY ARE I COULD SEE I WAS SURPRISING MISS FORREST MORE AND MORE BUT SHE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN
THEN WHEN THE ATTENTION OF THE GUESTS WAS DRAWN TOWARDS THOSE WHO DISPLAYED THEIR POWERS AT ACTING I SAW VOLTAIRE RISE AND GO OUT AND SOON AFTER HE WAS FOLLOWED BY HIS FRIEND
IS IT YOU JUSTIN SAID A VOICE
MY MIND REFUSED TO THINK MY TONGUE REFUSED TO SPEAK WHEN THAT WAS THE SUBJECT
I'M ALL RIGHT I SAID ALMOST MECHANICALLY AT THE SAME TIME FEELING AS IF I WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A CHARM
COULD YOU MANAGE TO PUT ME IN A ROOM WHERE I CAN SEE HIM AT SUPPER WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED
THUS TREES AND BUSHES WERE LADEN WITH SNOW CRYSTALS WHILE THE SPOTLESS WHITE WAS RELIEVED HERE AND THERE BY SOME SHINING EVERGREEN LEAVES WHICH PEEPED OUT AMIDST THEIR SNOWY MANTLES
LOOK SAID ABOU LOOK IN HELFA'S HAND I LOOKED INTENTLY
FOR A FRANC HE WOULD GIVE ME THEIR HISTORY AND LEAD ME TO THEM
HE SAID HE'D TELEGRAPH WOULD YOU MIND LETTING ME KNOW THE TRAIN
TAKE YOUR UNIVERSITY DEGREES--YOUR CAMBRIDGE AND OXFORD MASTER OF ARTS FOR EXAMPLE
HE COMMENCED TALKING ABOUT YORKSHIRE ITS CUSTOMS LEGENDS AND SUPERSTITIONS AND THEN WITH A TACT AND SHREWDNESS WHICH I COULD NOT RESIST HE DREW ME INTO A TALK ABOUT MYSELF
I FELT IT CLINGING TO EVERY FIBRE OF MY BEING
TOM TOOK ME TO MY ROOM AND THEN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH SAID MAKE HASTE OLD FELLOW
MIGHT I ASK YOUR BUSINESS I ASKED AS COOLLY AS I COULD
TO SAY I WAS SORRY WOULD BE BUT TO HINT AT MY FEELINGS
WAS THERE ONE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET
BUT MY TONGUE WAS UNLOOSED
LOOK HERE MY MAN YOU SHOWED YOUR HAND IMMEDIATELY YOU CAME AND YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING YOUR GAME WITHOUT KNOWING THE TRUMP CARDS
I REMEMBER NOTHING
GOD MEANT THE GOOD ONE GOD IS ETERNALLY GOOD ALL-POWERFUL IF THERE IS A GOD
STILL AT THAT VERY MOMENT THE INHERENT OBSTINACY OF MY NATURE SHOWED ITSELF
I THINK NOT
MORE THAN THIS HE HAD DESIGNS UPON THE WOMAN I LOVED WHILE I WAS POWERLESS NAY WORSE THAN POWERLESS FOR HE MIGHT MAKE ME DO THINGS WHICH WOULD BE ALTOGETHER OPPOSED TO WHAT I BELIEVED RIGHT AND TRUE
I KNEW THEN THAT I WAS MORE IN HIS POWER THAN EVER
VOLTAIRE ON THE CONTRARY WAS UNUSUALLY BLAND AND SMILING
PERHAPS HE WOULD LIKE NOT ONLY TO SEE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE POWER OF THE UNSEEN BUT TO FEEL THEM
DID YOU NOT COME HERE AGAINST YOUR WILL
IT HAD NERVED ME TO TRY
THAT WAS BUT AS A TERRIBLE NIGHTMARE--AN AWFUL DREAM
HE WOULD CHECK MY EVERY MOVE
HOW MUCH SHALL IT BE NOT A PENNY UNTIL YOUR WORK IS ACCOMPLISHED REPLIED THE LITTLE MAN WITH DIGNITY
OF COURSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM EXPLAINS THEIR BEING IN LEAGUE IN YORKSHIRE
AROUND WAS A STRANGE LAND AND A WILD LAWLESS PEOPLE
BY THIS TIME THERE WAS EVERY EVIDENCE OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON
I DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH OF EITHER I REPLIED TO GIVE AN ANSWER REASONABLY EITHER IN THE AFFIRMATIVE OR THE NEGATIVE
ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE FELT AS I DID CAN KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT
THE WORK HAD GOT BEHIND AND SO I ASKED TWO OR THREE OF THE SERVANTS TO ASSIST ME SHE STOPPED HERE AS IF AT A LOSS HOW TO PROCEED
YOU CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING
DURING THE DAY THERE WAS HUNTING SKATING AND RIDING WHILE AT NIGHT THERE WAS STORY-TELLING CHARADES GAMES OF VARIOUS SORTS AND DANCING
I REFRAINED FROM GOING TO SCOTLAND YARD AS I THOUGHT VOLTAIRE WOULD BE WATCHING ME
I WISH YOU HAD SAID NOTHING ABOUT HIS STORY WAS HER REPLY
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS MUCH TALKING
AT ANY RATE SUCH IS MY OPINION
HE'S A GETTIN IN THE TRAIN HE IS CAN YOU SEE THE NAME OF THE STATION NO I CAN'T
THEY ARE MOSTLY DEGRADED AND UNCULTURED LACKING"--HERE HE BOWED TO THE LADIES--"THAT DELIGHTFUL POLISH WHICH CHARACTERIZES THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE WEST
I HAVE ONLY DABBLED IN THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNSEEN BUT I KNOW ENOUGH TO TELL YOU THAT WHAT MY FRIEND SAYS IS TRUE WAS THIS A RUSE ON THE PART OF THE EGYPTIAN
THE POPULATION IS RATHER THIN HERE SIR
MONTE CARLO
THEY'RE IN LEAGUE SUR HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY'VE BIN A-PROMENADIN TOGETHER NEARLY EVERY DAY SINCE CHRISTMAS
IF HOWEVER NONE OF YOU WILL VOLUNTEER I CAN SEE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE ACCORDINGLY A MAN ABOUT MY OWN AGE WAS BROUGHT IN AND INTRODUCED AS SIMON SLOWDEN
I FOUND THIS TO BE TRUE IN THE PRESENT CASE
WE'VE SEEN THAT OUR MAN IS ALIVE BUT DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY HOPE OF FINDING HIM I'M SURE THERE IS ONLY BE PATIENT BUT WHAT MUST I DO WELL TAKE THIS MAN TO SEE SOME OF THE SIGHTS OF LONDON UNTIL THREE O'CLOCK THEN COME HOME TO DINNER
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE AD BIN WACCINATED FORTY TIMES AND WERE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER LEGS AND ARMS NATURAL NO J'INTS MASTER BLAKE
MY SENSES WERE NUMBED AND ALL THE WHILE HIS TERRIBLE GLITTERING EYES RESTED ON MINE
IF EVER A MAN LOOKED POSSESSED OF AN EVIL SPIRIT IT WAS HE
THAT YOU WOULD PULL ME LIMB FROM LIMB
HER MOUTH WAS LARGE AND COARSE AND TO MAKE THAT FEATURE STILL MORE OBJECTIONABLE TWO LARGE TEETH LIKE TWO FANGS STUCK OUT AT A CONSIDERABLE ANGLE FROM HER UPPER JAW AND RESTED ON THE LOWER LIP
WELL SHE GOT INTO A TEMPER AND TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW MR BLAKE'S NAME TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH YOURS IN HER ROOM THEN SUR THAT ERE WILLAIN HE SWORE LIKE A TROOPER AND SAID HE'D MAKE YOU RUE THE DAY YOU WERE BORN
HE MUST BE THE OLD NICK IN THE GARRET
THAT TERRIBLE PLACE TO WHICH WE RODE THE OTHER DAY THE SAME GENTLE LADY AND THEN WHEN WE CAME THERE WE FOUND MR BLAKE IN A RECLINING POSITION WITH A BLOODY KNIFE IN HIS HAND
NEITHER COULD WE SPEAK MUCH FOR THE TONGUE IS GENERALLY SILENT WHEN THE SOUL IS WRAPPED IN MYSTERY
SIMON'S SKETCH OF THE STREETS HAD NOT BEEN A FALSE ONE
BUT SHE DID NOT REPLY IN THE SAME VEIN
I SOON FOUND THAT THE NOISE HAD ROUSED THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD AND SO WHEN I ARRIVED I FOUND A NUMBER OF THE GUESTS HAD GATHERED TOGETHER
SHE'S AS SHARP AS A LANCET AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO DECEIVE HER IF ONLY THAT BLAKE HADN'T COME HE SAYS AS IF TALKIN TO HISSELF
I TURNED TOWARDS HER AND SAW HER LOOKING ADMIRINGLY AT THIS MAN WHOM I COULD NOT HELP FEARING
BROOKLETS WATERFALLS RIVERS ALL WERE HELD FAST BY THE ICE-KING
I WOULD DO IT
I SAW THAT SHE CRIED EXCITEDLY
I WILL NOT SAY REPLIED VOLTAIRE
SHE STILL BELIEVED ME INNOCENT
IF HE IS NOT PROVED TO BE GUILTLESS WITHIN A YEAR I WILL MARRY YOU HE LEAPT TO HIS FEET AS IF TO EMBRACE HER
YOU MUST GO TO LONDON TO-MORROW AND GO ON WITH YOUR OLD WORK
ALL THE NEWS WHEN WE MEET
A GREAT DEAL DEPENDS ON FINDING HIM AT ONCE
I DID NOT KNOW THE DISTRICT AT ALL BUT I HAD BEEN TOLD IN WHAT DIRECTION DREARWATER POND LAY SO I DID NOT DOUBT THAT I SHOULD EASILY FIND THEM
IT GETS THICKER THE CLOSER YOU GET TO LEEDS AND HOW FAR THE OTHER WAY ONLY A MATTER OF THREE MILES NORTHWARD SIR
I RECOGNIZED THE STEELY GLITTER OF THOSE WHITY-GREY ORBS WHICH AT TIMES SEEMED TINTED WITH GREEN
THEN I DROVE BACK TO MY ROOMS IN GOWER STREET WEARY AND SAD YET NOT HOPELESS
I HAD GOT HIM A PERFECTLY FITTING SUIT OF CLOTHES IN PARIS IN WHICH HE LOOKED A RESPECTABLE MEMBER OF SOCIETY
AND EVEN IF YOU DID NOT YOU COULD NEVER FIND HIM
I HOPE YOU WILL NOT I REPLIED MEANINGLY
HE BELIEVED BUT LITTLE IN THE POWERS OF THE SOUL OR IN THE SPIRIT WORLD
JUST SO HE ANSWERED WITH A SMILE
NO DOUBT BY THIS VOLTAIRE WAS GLOATING OVER HIS VICTORY WHILE I WAS NEARLY MAD WITH DESPAIR
BUT I DID NOT FEEL THE BITING WIND OR NOTICE THE WEIRD DESOLATION THAT WAS ALL AROUND
HERE THE ORDINARY TOURIST STOPS AND STOPS TOO AT THE BEGINNING OF WHAT REALLY INTERESTS AN IMAGINATIVE MIND
I REMEMBERED MISS FORREST TOO
I KNOW NOTHING AGAINST THEM
I CANNOT
YOU DO NOT KNOW THE TERRIBLE SLAVERY THAT BINDS ME NEITHER CAN I TELL YOU I SHALL TRUST IN YOU TO DELIVER ME FROM THIS MAN SHE WENT ON WITHOUT HEEDING ME
NO--WHY CAUSE I CAN'T STAND THAT TOUGH AS I BE
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS I LOOKED AND SAW A FINELY-WORKED NECKCLOTH ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN ARABIC CHARACTERS THE WORDS ABA WADY KAFFAR IT HAD EVERY APPEARANCE OF BEING SOILED BY SEVERE WRENCHING AND ON IT WERE SPOTS OF BLOOD
IT IS ABSURD TO THINK THAT MR BLAKE IS GUILTY OF SUCH A DEED HE POINTED WITH A TREMBLING HAND TO THE BLOODY KNIFE
CAN YOU HELP ME TO FIND OUT HIS WHEREABOUTS UNDOUBTEDLY I CAN
AND THERE WAS A KNIFE IN HER HAND AND THAT MEANS THAT TWILL BE DONE BY A KNIFE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT THIS GIRL'S WORDS MADE
YES THERE IS JUSTIN
NEITHER OF THEM PAID THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO ME
SHE LOOKED AS HAPPY AS A GIRL COULD WELL LOOK
I HAD TO REFRAIN FROM DOING WHAT HE TOLD ME I WAS NOT TO DO
A COUPLE OF LANGUAGES THE LITERATURE OF TWO OR THREE COUNTRIES MATHEMATICS AND SOMETHING ELSE WHICH I HAVE FORGOTTEN NOW YOU ARE SCARCELY CORRECT SIR SAID ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO CAME IN WITH ME
KAFFAR ON THE OTHER HAND TREATED ME VERY RUDELY
YES I SAID
MY WALK AND TALK WITH HER THAT DAY WERE REAL
THE USUAL TIME FOR AN EXPRESS TRAIN TO RUN FROM DOVER TO VICTORIA IS ABOUT TWO HOURS
NAY MORE THAN THAT
IF KAFFAR WERE SEEN IN LONDON VOLTAIRE'S PLANS WOULD BE UPSET AND I DID NOT THINK MY ENEMY WOULD ALLOW THAT
I ROSE UP WENT TO THE CHAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND DEFIANTLY SAID THERE
AT ANY RATE THE GHOST WAS REAL TO HIM
ARE YOU NOT STAYING HERE NOW AGAINST YOUR WILL
THERE ARE HOWEVER SOME FINE RUINS HERE WHICH WELL REPAY ONE FOR A VISIT
I SEES THEY TWO WILLAINS A-TALKIN TOGETHER AND WHEN THAT ERE WOLTAIRE WENT OFF BY HIMSELF THE OTHER TOOK IT PON HIM TO KEEP WI ME
WHAT SEE YOU SON HEROD I SEE A PARADISE I REPLIED BUT I CANNOT DESCRIBE IT
I AM GLAD HE IS SAFE AND HE MUST REMAIN SAFE CRIED VOLTAIRE
FIRST IT WAS NOW CHRISTMAS EVE WHICH AT ALL TIMES CAUSED THE GENERAL TRAFFIC TO BE DELAYED
AND WE MUST NOT STAY LONG WHY BECAUSE I THINK WE ARE WATCHED BUT WHY SHOULD WE BE WATCHED
NEVER DID I MEET WITH ANY ONE WHO HAS A HIGHER SENSE OF HONOUR THAN SHE
BUT I KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT LAY IN THE FUTURE WHILE MISS FORREST'S GREAT DARK EYES BEAMED UPON ME IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE EARTH SEEM LIKE HEAVEN
I DID NOT INTEND COMING AT FIRST BUT YOUR AUNT POOR SILLY THING SAID YOU WOULD NOT TAKE YOUR MAID WITH YOU AND SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A SIN FOR A YOUNG GIRL LIKE YOU TO TRAVEL ALONE TO YORKSHIRE ON A DAY LIKE THIS YORKSHIRE I THOUGHT
THAT POND WILL BE PUMPED DRY AND EVERY OUTLET EXAMINED
IT SEEMED MY ONLY RESOURCE AND I FELT THAT SOMEHOW SOMETHING WOULD COME OF IT
MY HEART BEGAN TO BEAT VIOLENTLY NOW FOR I FELT I WAS NEAR THE TIME WHEN MY LABOURS WOULD BE REWARDED BY SUCCESS OR I SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP MY SEARCH IN DESPAIR
WHO'S THERE TOM TEMPLE I SPRANG OUT OF BED AND LET HIM IN
THE TRAIN SWEPT INTO VICTORIA AT A QUARTER-PAST TEN
WHERE WAS KAFFAR
AT FIRST I WAS AFRAID YOU WERE A DETECTIVE FELLOW BUT I SEE NOW
AND WHEN A FELLER LIKE THAT ERE WOLTAIRE GOES A-WALKIN WITH A CREATURE LIKE THAT HANCIENT WIRGIN ON HIS ARM THEN I THINK THERE MUST BE SOMETHIN ON BOARD BUT THIS IS PURELY SURMISE SIMON
I WAS SURE THAT EVERY MEANS HE COULD DEVISE TO DEFEAT ME WOULD BE EAGERLY USED
YOUR SINCERE FRIEND TOM TEMPLE
VICE WAS CONQUERING
WHAT'S THE MATTER I ASKED
AFTER DINNER HE'LL BE SLEEPY
THE TRUTH WAS I WAS AFRAID LEST THERE SHOULD BE SOME DESIGN IN VOLTAIRE'S APPARENT FRIENDLINESS AND KAFFAR'S EVIDENT DESIRE TO AROUSE ENMITY AND SO I DETERMINED TO BE ON MY GUARD
BUT THERE MUST EVER BE SOME DATA UPON WHICH TO GO AND YOU SEE YOU GIVE ME NONE THAT IS IN THE LEAST SATISFACTORY PERHAPS YOU CAN I SAID IF I RELATE TO YOU ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH WHAT IS I THINK A SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE STORY I HAD DETERMINED TO TELL THIS LITTLE MAN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO KAFFAR'S DISCOVERY ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH HAPPENED IN YORKSHIRE
WHERE IT CAME FROM I KNEW NOT
FOR A TIME I THOUGHT I WAS DISEMBODIED AND IN MY NEW EXISTENCE I DID DEEDS TOO TERRIBLE TO RELATE
TRY AND TELL OF MY INFLUENCE OVER YOU SEEK TO SPEAK ONE WORD AGAINST ME AND MARK THE RESULT
CHAPTER XIII A MESMERIST'S SPELL I FOUND ON ENTERING THE BREAKFAST-ROOM THAT MY PRESENCE CAUSED NO SURPRISE NEITHER DID ANY OF THE GUESTS REGARD ME SUSPICIOUSLY
AND IS THE EGYPTIAN AT HOME NOW NO SAID THE MAN EYEING ME KEENLY
HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD THE PLUCK TO ASK EDITH GRAY TO BE HIS WIFE HE SAYS HAD NOT HIS LADY-LOVE BEEN SO FEARFUL
YOU SHALL SEE HER LIPS TOUCH MINE
HOWEVER AS YOU KNOW YER HONOUR TIS MOONLIGHT SO I DIDN'T TROUBLE
I HAD SEEN ALL THIS BEFORE BUT TO SIMON IT WAS A MARVEL OF BEAUTY
STILL HER LOVE HAD NERVED ME TO DO WHAT I OTHERWISE COULD NEVER HAVE DONE
AND SO I WAS LEFT ALONE WITH THE WOMAN I LOVED
HERE GOES YER HONOUR VOLTAIRE EYED HIM DOUBTFULLY AND SIMON COOLLY RETURNED THE STARE
I WAS SUCCESSFUL IN THIS
WITHIN THAT YEAR YOU ARE NOT TO SEE ME OR COMMUNICATE WITH ME BUT HE CRIED IF KAFFAR IS DEAD IF THESE TERRIBLE EVIDENCES OF MURDER ARE REAL THEN IN A YEAR--SAY NEXT CHRISTMAS EVE
WAIT
THIS HOWEVER DID NOT AUGUR SO WELL FOR MY INQUIRIES
SO DIFFERENT FROM EGYPT--AH SO DIFFERENT
BUT EVEN THEN IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW
ANYHOW HERE'S SOMETHING ON ACCOUNT AND I PUT A TWENTY-POUND NOTE IN HIS HAND
DARK FORMS SEEMED TO COME FROM VOLTAIRE'S EYES
BUT FOR ME SHE SAYS HER SON WOULD HAVE MARRIED GERTRUDE AND THEN SHE WOULD HAVE LIVED WITH HER HEROD WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN NOT THE POOR OUTCAST HE IS NOW
HE LOOKED AS IF HE'D BEEN FIGHTIN AND YET HE WAS QUITE SOBER
AND YET I MUST
MINE BY A NEW LIFE WHICH I HAD BUT LATELY BEGUN TO LIVE BY A STRENGTH GIVEN ME THROUGH COMMUNION WITH MY MAKER
SHE MINGLES WITH THOSE WHO ARE MOST OBEYED SEE YOU ANYTHING BY WHICH THE MYSTERY CAN BE LEARNED I CAN SEE NOTHING I HEARD A SIGH
HE TOO GAVE YOU THE IDEA OF POWER BUT IT WAS THE POWER OF A SUBORDINATE
THAT'S IT--YES WHAT IS HE DOING TALKIN WITH A MAN WHO KEEPS AN HOTEL WHAT DOES HE SAY IT'S IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND I CAN'T TELL CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT HE SAID IT SOUNDED LIKE THIS--'_JE RESTEY ICI POUR KELKA JOUR BUT I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT IT MEANS THE PROFESSOR TURNED TO ME
I HAPPEN TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH CAMBRIDGE AND HAVE TAKEN THE DEGREE YOU MENTION
I THOUGHT I MADE A FORWARD STEP AT DOVER FOR ON INQUIRING AT AN HOTEL THERE I FOUND THAT A MAN ANSWERING TO KAFFAR'S DESCRIPTION HAD ENGAGED A BEDROOM FOR ONE NIGHT AND HAD GONE ON TO CALAIS BY THE MIDDAY BOAT IN TIME TO CATCH THE EXPRESS FOR PARIS
BUT I WAS NOT AFRAID
THERE IS ALSO PLENTY OF SHOOTING HUNTING ETC ETC
LET US HAVE ANOTHER RIDE THIS AFTERNOON AND SEE WHETHER YOU CAN'T MAKE MISS FORREST A PLEASANT COMPANION IF MISS FORREST WOULD ALLOW ME I SHOULD BE DELIGHTED I SAID
I INSINUATE NOTHING I REPLIED
I WAS RIGHT
ONE HAS TO CHOOSE TIMES OCCASIONS AND PROPER CIRCUMSTANCES IN ORDER TO TELL SUCH FACTS HE SAID
WELL I DON'T WANT YOUR SOCIETY
AND SECOND I HOPED BY ENTERING THE DRAWING-ROOM EARLY I MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO MISS FORREST
FOUR WAS THE REPLY
SO HE SAYS TO ME SIMON SAYS HE GO UP IN THE PLANTATION AND PULL UP A YOUNG FIR TREE AND THEN IN THE MORNING PUT IT IN THE CART AND TAKE IT OVER TO THE SCHOOL-ROOM THIS WAS DAY AFORE YESTERDAY IN THE AFTERNOON
I MIGHT HEAR DISCLOSED THE SECRET OF HIS INFLUENCE AND THEREBY DISCOVER THE MEANS WHEREBY I COULD BE FREE AND THIS FREEDOM MIGHT I HOPED MAKE ME HIS MASTER
MISS FORREST IS MINE BECAUSE SHE KNOWS I AM MASTER OF YOUR LIFE
HEROD VOLTAIRE I SAID VILLAIN BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION I DO NOT BELIEVE IN YOUR POWER
I AM SORRY I REPLIED IF I HAVE CAUSED ANNOYANCE
I'LL DO IT IN THREE-QUARTERS FOR A QUID YER HONOUR IT WAS NOW NEARLY HALF-PAST TEN
I REALIZED THAT TO BE MASTER OVER MYSELF MEANT BEING A SLAVE TO NONE
WHERE'S DR SHARP SAID MRS TEMPLE ADDING THAT THEY COULD EASILY FIND OUT THE DOCTOR'S PRESENT WHEREABOUTS THE NEXT DAY
HAVE YOU MANY LODGERS AT PRESENT I ASKED
THE WORDS WERE DRAGGED OUT OF ME AS IF BY SHEER FORCE OF ANOTHER WILL WHILE I LOOKED VACANTLY BEFORE ME
WHILE AT--YES THE VERY THING!--THAT'S DELIGHTFUL WHAT'S DELIGHTFUL YOU'LL KNOW TO-NIGHT
MASTER BLAKE HE SAID SOLEMNLY IT'S THAT WACCINATIN PROCESS AS HEV DONE IT
STILL I DID NOT SPEAK A WORD
GOT UP BY SOME VILLAIN FOR A PURPOSE AND I CAN GUESS WHO HE IS THIS IS SERIOUS SAID TOM TEMPLE
OH THE WEARY WORK THE DREADFUL UNCERTAINTY
WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE VERY UNCEREMONIOUS MR BLAKE SHE SAID AND I SHALL EXPECT MY SON'S FRIEND TO MAKE HIMSELF PERFECTLY AT HOME I THANKED HER HEARTILY FOR I BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE STRANGE
STILL I FANCIED I SAW HIS LIGHT GLITTERING EYES TURNED IN MY DIRECTION
THREE WEEKS AND THREE DAYS AND I KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO
THE MAN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR WHILE I STOOD CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND THE MOMENT HE OPENED THE DOOR I ENTERED THE ROOM
ARE YOU WELL MR BLAKE SHE ASKED AGAIN
THE TELEGRAM WAS FROM NICE
THIS LED ME TO DEFY HIM STILL
I--YOU DON'T KNOW ALL
BUT I DID NOT LISTEN--I COULD NOT
WHETHER YOU KNOW IT OR NOT I RODE FROM LONDON TO LEEDS WITH YOU YESTERDAY AND I HAVE THOUGHT EVER SINCE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOU SHE LOOKED STRAIGHT AT ME AS IF SHE WOULD READ MY THOUGHTS AND THEN SAID PLEASANTLY I WAS ON THE POINT OF ASKING YOU WHETHER SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE
BUT I--THAT IS AND TOM STOPPED
I HAD DONE MY BEST
BUT I'M BLOWED--THERE I CAN'T SAY FAIRER NOR THAT WHY WHAT DO YOU THINK I DAREN'T TELL YOU YER HONOUR FOR FEAR I'LL MAKE ANOTHER MISTAKE
AVOID HIM AS YOU WOULD A PESTILENCE I SPOKE PASSIONATELY PLEADINGLY
DO YOU FEEL QUITE RIGHT I AM AWFULLY WEAK I SAID AND COLD SHIVERS CREEP DOWN MY LEGS YOU WERE SUCH A LONG TIME UNDER THE INFLUENCE WHATEVER IT IS SAID TOM
BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND WAITED QUIETLY FOR A VOLUNTEER
MY NEXT STEP THEREFORE WAS TO RETURN TO LONDON AND THEN GO TO DOVER CALAIS NEWHAVEN AND DIEPPE TO TRY TO SEE WHETHER KAFFAR COULD BE TRACED
PRESENTLY HOWEVER OUR ATTENTION WAS BY DEGREES DRAWN TO THAT PART OF THE ROOM WHERE HEROD VOLTAIRE SAT AND I HEARD HIM SPEAKING FLUENTLY AND SMOOTHLY ON SOME SUBJECT HE WAS DISCUSSING WITH A YOUNG LADY
TWAS ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK AND WE WERE ALL VERY BUSY WHEN WE HEARD A NOISE IN THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE DOOR
IF I HOPED IT WAS ALMOST WITHOUT REASON
MY OVERTAXED NERVES COULD BEAR NO MORE
I HAVE NOT ONLY SEEN A BETTER PERFORMANCE AT A DOZEN ENTERTAINMENTS BUT I HAVE FOUND OUT THE SECRET OF WHAT IS CALLED THOUGHT-READING DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVE SEEN SIMILAR FEATS BEFORE ASKED VOLTAIRE SAVAGELY
BUT HOW CAN I
I TRIED TO GIT IM OFF BUT TWAS NO USE
CHAPTER IX THE HALL GHOST PERHAPS SOME OF MY READERS MAY THINK I WAS DOING WRONG IN DETERMINING TO LISTEN TO THE PROPOSED CONFERENCE BETWEEN MISS STAGGLES AND VOLTAIRE
THUS THE ETERNAL GOODNESS BRINGS GOOD OUT OF EVIL
CHAPTER XVI STRUGGLING FOR VICTORY I CONFESS THAT I WAS SOMEWHAT EXCITED AS I HEARD HIM COMING UP THE STAIRS
NOTHING WAS CERTAIN YET
SEEING WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND HEARING WHAT I HAVE HEARD I BEG TO QUOTE YOUR GREATEST POET THERE ARE MORE THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH THAN ARE DREAMT OF IN YOUR PHILOSOPHY YOUR QUOTATION IS APROPOS SHE SAID IN REPLY BUT IT SO HAPPENS THAT I HAVE TAKEN CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THE MATTER ABOUT WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING AND AFTER SEEING VARIOUS REPRESENTATIONS OF THESE SO-CALLED OCCULT SCIENCES AND CAREFULLY EXAMINING THEM I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY ARE ONLY SO MANY FAIRLY CLEVER JUGGLING TRICKS WHICH HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS TO DECEIVE CREDULOUS PEOPLE
WILL YOU SIT DOWN MR VOLTAIRE I SAID AFTER A MINUTE'S PERFECT SILENCE
CERTAINLY HE WAS NOT NEAR
IT LOOKED VERY INNOCENT TO BE MESMERIZED LAST NIGHT DIDN'T IT
WHERE IS HE NOW HE WAS IN A BEAUTIFUL TOWN
I'LL GO AND SPEAK TO THEM AND GET THEM ALL SAFE IN THE CARRIAGE AND THEN AS THERE WILL BE BARELY ROOM FOR ME I'LL COME BACK AND RIDE HOME WITH YOU HE RUSHED AWAY AS HE SPOKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES CAME BACK AGAIN
ON THE WHOLE I WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE INTERVIEW
MEANWHILE QUESTION AFTER QUESTION WAS ASKED AND ANSWERED WHILE VOLTAIRE AND KAFFAR STOOD SIDE BY SIDE EACH WITH A TERRIBLE GLITTER IN HIS EYES
BUT CERTAINLY IT COULD NOT BE BELIEVED IN BY ANY WELL-BALANCED MIND
THE HALL GHOST X
LOOKING AT THE WHOLE MATTER IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT FOLLOWED I BELIEVE IT WAS
I HAD AT THE TIME OF MY STORY BEEN FOLLOWING THE BENT OF MY INCLINATIONS FOR TWO YEARS WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUCCESS AND WAS REGARDED BY THOSE WHO KNEW ME AS A LUCKY FELLOW
WE ALL WAITED ANXIOUSLY FOR HER TO SPEAK
BUT SHE WAS VERY RESERVED AND I THOUGHT HER FACE LOOKED VERY PALE
I KNOW I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE LISTENED TO IT BUT I DID
STILL IN THE DARK
AH I SPURN YOU SPIT UPON YOU MR KAFFAR SAID TOM TEMPLE REALLY THIS CANNOT BE ALLOWED
I QUITE EXPECTED TO BE ALONE FOR AN HOUR AT LEAST
AND SHE NO DOUBT CONFUSED BY THE PRESENCE OF VOLTAIRE CHEERFULLY ASSENTED
IN THE PROVERBS OF JOB WE READ FOOL AND HIS MONEY SOON PARTED AND SO WE CAN SEE OW TRUE THE TEACHIN IS TO-DAY BUT WHAT IS TO BE DONE SIMON SIMON SHOOK HIS HEAD AND THEN SAID SOLEMNLY I'M AWAY FROM MY BEARIN'S SUR
YOU DEAL WITH THE THINGS WHICH ARE SEEN BUT THINK NOT OF THE GREAT UNSOLVED SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS OF LIFE
I DID NOT REST
BUT HAS THE KNOWLEDGE COME SINCE ASKED A VOICE
HOW
ALL IS DARK TO ME TOM LEFT ME THEN WHILE I WITH MY POOR TIRED BRAIN TRIED TO THINK WHAT TO DO
NO SIR I DON'T REMEMBER SUCH A PERSON
SURE NOUGH SUR I WUR RIGHT
WHY ASKED MISS FORREST
GRADUALLY I KNEW I WAS MASTERING HIM--THEN ALL WAS BLANK
HERE I FOUND THE MAN I HAD COME TO SEE
AND YET I WAS SCARCELY SATISFIED
CHAPTER VI AFTERWARDS WHEN I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS I WAS IN MY BEDROOM
CHAPTER XVII USING THE ENEMY'S WEAPONS TWO MONTHS PASSED AND NO TIDINGS OF KAFFAR--AT LEAST NONE THAT WERE WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION
THE LOVING WORK OF MONTHS IS ALMOST AT AN END AND SOON I MUST DROP MY PEN
YOU MUST BE A WIZARD HEROD VOLTAIRE OR YOU COULDN'T HAVE SUMMED UP HER DISPOSITION SO CORRECTLY HER SENSE OF HONOUR IS VERY GREAT
AND THAT'S WHY I'VE SENT FOR YOU BUT I CAN'T DO NOTHINK MUCH SUR
THANK GOD
WHEN YOUR SPIRIT IS PREPARED THE KNOWLEDGE WILL COME VOLTAIRE STOPPED ABRUPTLY
EVERY HOUR OF WAITING WAS AS THE READER MAY IMAGINE OF GREAT ANXIETY TO ME
I HAIN'T GOT NO DOUBTS IN MY MIND BUT THAT HINFIDEL AND HIS DOOTIFUL BROTHER HEV GOT DEALIN'S WITH THE DEVIL SIMON ROSE AND WENT TO THE DOOR OPENED IT AND PEERED CAUTIOUSLY AROUND
BUT MR TEMPLE HAS TOLD YOU THE CONDITION OF THE PROMISE AS WELL SHE SAID
I AM VERY HAPPY HAPPIER THAN I EVER HOPED TO BE
HE HAD BEEN VOLTAIRE'S TOOL WHO HAD FRIGHTENED HIM TO DO HIS EVERY BIDDING
STILL I GAVE UP THE IDEA OF EVER SEEING HER AGAIN AND TRIED TO THINK OF THE VISIT I WAS ABOUT TO PAY
IT STOPS AT EVERY STATION FROM LEEDS HOW FAR IS THE NEAREST STATION IN THE LEEDS DIRECTION SEVEN MILES SIR
RECOMMENDED BY AN HOTEL PROPRIETOR I ENGAGED TWO OF THE SHREWDEST MEN IN THIS WONDERFUL CITY TO TRY AND FIND KAFFAR BUT THEY COULD DISCOVER NO TRACE OF HIM
WHAT A CHANGE IT WAS
YES I ALWAYS DO ON CHRISTMAS MORNING SHE REPLIED AS IF THANKFUL I HAD GIVEN HER AN OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING ABOUT OTHER MATTERS
AND THE OTHER WAS THAT IF HIS POWER WAS AS GREAT AS HE BOASTED HE NEEDED NOT BE SO ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN MY CONSENT TO HIS TERMS
I HAVE LOST MY STRENGTH
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT ERE EGYPTIAN HEV BIN DOGGIN ME ALL DAY
HOW COULD I FIND KAFFAR
ONE WAS THAT THIS MAN MUST HAVE SEEN THAT MISS FORREST LOOKED ON ME WITH A DEGREE OF FAVOUR
AND AGAIN WHENCE THE IDEA OF GOD WHENCE THE LONGING FOR HIM
BUT I AM SO EXCITED THAT I CAN SCARCELY MASTER MYSELF
THEN I FELL DOWN AT TOM TEMPLE'S FEET
IF BAD SHE IS CLOTHED IN BLACK
THE SNOW HAD FALLEN STEADILY ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT AND NO BREATH OF WIND HAD STIRRED THE FEATHERY FLAKES
EVEN IF I DID NOT KILL HIM PERHAPS VOLTAIRE HAD GOT HIM OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT HE MIGHT FASTEN THE GUILT ON ME
THEN I SAW HIM GRIP KAFFAR'S HAND
NO ONE COULD HEAR WHAT WE SAID
IT'S A SHAME THAT YOU SHOULD BE UNDER SUCH A BAN BECAUSE IF A MAN CAN'T MAKE HIMSELF PLEASANT TO LADIES WHAT CAN HE DO WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF I REPLIED
HER PRIDE WILL OVERCOME HER JUDGMENT AND BECAUSE OF IT SHE WILL DO THINGS FOR WHICH SHE WILL AFTERWARDS BE SORRY
VOLTAIRE WAS GONE WHILE THE GUESTS AND FAMILY WERE HAVING THEIR LUNCH
IS YOUR MIND CLEAR FAIRLY
YOU WILL ADMIT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU HERE THEN HE SAID
I SEEMED HEMMED IN ON EVERY HAND BY THIS MAN'S TERRIBLE POWER
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT WAS HER REPLY
ARRIVING AT TEMPLE HALL I SAW TOM READING A LETTER
PECULIAR INFLUENCES WERE ALL AROUND ME
I COULD SEE IN HIS FACE THAT HE HAD GUESSED MY SECRET WHILE I FANCIED I COULD SEE BENEATH HIS SOMEWHAT CYNICAL DEMEANOUR INDICATIONS OF HIS LOVE FOR GERTRUDE FORREST
LITTLE AND POOR AS THIS EVIDENCE WAS I DETERMINED TO GO TO EGYPT
I WOULD GIVE ALL I POSSESS IF I COULD
WE SPEAK AND THEY OBEY
HIS NAME SHALL NOT BE A SYNONYM FOR DEVILRY
ALL IS PLAIN AND OPEN AS THE DAY
BUT IT WAS CHRISTMAS EVE SPECIAL TRAINS WERE RUNNING AND PASSENGERS CROWDED ON EVERY HAND THUS WE WERE MORE THAN THREE HOURS IN ACCOMPLISHING THE JOURNEY
HOW SLOWLY THE TRAIN SEEMED TO CREEP TO BE SURE
YOU ARE TOO KIND TOO FORBEARING MR VOLTAIRE OH LEAVE ME CRIED MISS FORREST CLINGING CLOSER TO ME
EVEN SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN SHUDDERED NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE STORY THAT WAS TOLD AS THE STRANGE POWER OF THE MAN THAT TOLD IT
YOU MUST REMEMBER YOU ARE AMONG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES
BUT HE TIRED OF ENGLAND SO I SENT HIM BACK TO CAIRO
MY BRAIN BEGAN TO WHIRL WHILE A TERRIBLE POWER GRIPPED ME
NEVER I THINK DID I SEE SO MUCH TERROR ASTONISHMENT MINGLED WITH HATE EXPRESSED ON A HUMAN FACE BEFORE
TO SIT ON DECK AND GAZE AT THE SMOOTH SEA WHICH REFLECTED IN ITS DEEP WATERS THE BRIGHT STARRY HEAVENS WHILE THE SPLASH OF THE WATERS MADE MUSIC ON THE VESSEL'S SIDE WAS TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING NOT EASILY FORGOTTEN
FOUR YEARS DID I LIVE IN INDIA AMONG THE SAGES WHO HOLD FAST TO THE TEACHING OF BUDDHA
THEN SAID HE JEERINGLY YOUR LIFE MUST BE RUINED
THE NAME OF THE SMALLER MAN WAS SIMPLY THAT OF AN EGYPTIAN ABA WADY KAFFAR THE GUESTS CALLED HIM MR KAFFAR AND THUS MADE IT AS MUCH ENGLISH AS POSSIBLE
I WANT TO BE CERTAIN THIS IS THE RIGHT HOUSE MEANWHILE I NOTICED THAT MY CONSTANT FRIEND SIMON HELD KAFFAR BY THE ARM
IT WAS ALSO NEAR THE STATION AND FAIRLY NEAR THE PLACE WHERE ACCORDING TO SIMON'S SKETCH KAFFAR WAS STAYING
YOU CAN DO NOTHING THAT I HAVE COMMANDED YOU NOT TO DO
YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO WOO AND TO WIN MISS GERTRUDE FORREST I NEVER WILL I CRIED
THAT IS NOT FAIR I SAID
YOUR STORY DOES NOT APPEAR REASONABLE AND ALTHOUGH I HOPE I DO NOT OFFEND YOU BY SAYING SO I CANNOT ACCEPT IT AS GOSPEL PERHAPS SAID KAFFAR WHO SPOKE FOR THE FIRST TIME MR BLAKE WOULD LIKE SOME PROOFS
MONTHS HAD PASSED AWAY AND I HAD TAKEN NO FORWARD STEP
PERCHANCE I SHOULD WOUND YOUR TENDER FEELINGS TOO DEEPLY MR KAFFAR WILL REMEMBER HE'S SPEAKING TO A LADY I'M SURE SAID TOM TEMPLE
WAS I RIGHT IN THUS OPENLY DEFYING THE MAN WHO POSSESSED SUCH A TERRIBLE POWER
THE LADIES RETIRED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM WHILE THE GENTLEMEN PREPARED TO SIT OVER THEIR WINE
YOU SEE WE ALL REMAINED UP SO LATE LAST NIGHT THAT IT WAS TO ME A SETTLED MATTER THAT NONE OF YOU WOULD APPEAR UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO START FOR CHURCH I HOPE I AM NOT DISTURBING YOU IN YOUR MORNING'S MEDITATIONS MR BLAKE SHE REPLIED
SO MUCH DO I BELIEVE IN IT THAT SOMETIMES I LONG TO BE WITH THOSE WHO HAVE GONE
I LOVE GERTRUDE FORREST WITH ALL MY HEART AND I WILL PROMISE NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OTHER MAN TO GIVE UP HOPES OF WINNING HER
FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO THE TIME OF WHICH I AM WRITING I HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN A WORK THAT REQUIRED A KNOWLEDGE OF THE ARABIC LANGUAGE AND ALTHOUGH IT CANNOT BE SAID I HAD BECOME ANYTHING LIKE PROFICIENT IN THAT TONGUE I HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY AN ARABIAN AND COULD ENTER INTO ORDINARY CONVERSATION
I DO NOT KNOW HOW I DARED TO MAKE MY CONFESSION OF LOVE FOR CERTAINLY I HAD BUT LITTLE PROOF OF HER CARING FOR ME
RELIEVE ME MY DEAR OR MY FEELIN'S WILL BE TOO MUCH FOR ME
FOR DAYS I TRIED TO THINK WHAT TO DO WITHOUT AVAIL
HIS MOVEMENTS WERE PERFECTLY GRACEFUL AND FROM THE FLUTTER AMONG THE YOUNG LADIES WHEN HE ENTERED I JUDGED HE HAD ALREADY SPENT SOME LITTLE TIME WITH THEM AND MADE NO SLIGHT IMPRESSION
ON MY WAY DOWN-STAIRS I SAW TOM TEMPLE WHO TOLD ME TO FIND MY WAY TO THE LIBRARY WHERE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PASS THE TIME PLEASANTLY
I WILL NOT DESCRIBE WHAT FOLLOWED
GIVE HER TIME AND POISON HER MIND AGAINST THAT BLAKE AND SHE'LL COME AROUND I'VE DONE THAT SAYS SHE
SURELY YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN ME UP HERE TO GIVE ME YOUR IMPRESSIONS CONCERNING MISS STAGGLES WELL I HEV PARTLY YER HONOUR
VOLTAIRE HOWEVER WAS NOT IN THE ROOM
HE FASCINATES WHILE HE REPELS
THE SOUNDS SEEMED TO COME FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE SERVANTS HALL AND QUICKLY PUTTING ON SOME CLOTHES I HURRIED THITHER
YOU SEEK NOT TO SOLVE THE OCCULT TRUTHS WHICH EXIST IN THE SPIRIT OF ALL MEN
I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT
NOW YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
I REMAINED IN THE ROOM A FEW MINUTES LONGER BUT SHE WAS STUDIOUSLY COLD AND POLITE TO ME SO THAT WHEN I MADE A PRETENCE OF GOING OUT TO THE STABLES TO SEE A NEW HORSE TOM TEMPLE HAD BOUGHT I DID SO WITH A HEAVY HEART
PERHAPS YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE ME WENT ON VOLTAIRE
INTRODUCES THE WRITER AND OTHERS II
THIS WONDERFUL MAN HAD A DAUGHTER BORN TO HIM IN HIS OLD AGE BORN TOO WITH THE SAME LOVE FOR TRUTH THE SAME THIRST FOR A KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS UNSEEN TO THE ORDINARY EYE
WELL AS I TOLD YER MONTHS AGO I WENT TO THE OUSEMAID FOR A MITE O COMFORT AND CATCHES ER A-COURTIN WI THE COACHMAN
HAVE WE BEEN TOGETHER THAT'S HIS KNIFE AT ANY RATE
YES I SEE HIM SAID SIMON AT LENGTH
HIS WILL AND MINE FOUGHT FOR THE MASTERY--HIS STRENGTHENED BY A KNOWLEDGE OF LAWS OF WHICH I WAS IGNORANT AND CONSTANT EXERTION OF IT
NOW FIRST OF ALL I WISH YOU TO BLINDFOLD MY FRIEND KAFFAR
YES HE WAS AT HOME BUT WOULD BE ENGAGED FOR THE NEXT QUARTER OF AN HOUR
MEANWHILE I WANT TO GIVE YOU A FEW INSTRUCTIONS WHAT ARE THEY YOU ARE NOT TO TAKE ONE STEP IN TRYING TO PROVE THAT KAFFAR IS ALIVE AH I CRIED
WHERE THEN
LET HIM SLEEP IF HE WILL UNTIL NINE O'CLOCK
WE DID NOT SEEK TO KNOW THE MYSTERY AFTER WHICH WE WERE PANTING UNTIL THE MIDNIGHT OF ILFRA'S BIRTHDAY
YOU SEE I CANNOT WORK MIRACLES
I SHOULD BE LEAVING THE WOMAN I WAS EACH DAY LOVING MORE AND MORE TO THE MAN WHO KNEW NO HONOUR NO MERCY NO MANLINESS
HEROD VOLTAIRE TURNED AND LOOKED ADMIRINGLY ON HER AND I SAW THAT A BLUSH TINGED BOTH THEIR CHEEKS
EVIDENTLY HE DID NOT THINK I GUESSED HIS WISHES
FOR YOUR SAKE I COULD GIVE UP HOME FRIENDS HAPPINESS LIFE
I SAT FOR A WHILE IN SILENCE SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF MY SURROUNDINGS
BAH
WHEREAS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS DEATH
I LEARNT ONE GREAT LESSON THERE HOWEVER AND THAT WAS THE EVIL OF GAMBLING
SHE IS AN ORPHAN
BUT TOM TEMPLE IMMEDIATELY SENT TO THE KITCHEN AND FOUND THAT THINGS WERE AS WAS DESCRIBED
THAT HE TELLS YOU TO DO YOUR WORST I FELT THAT AGAIN HE WAS TRYING TO THROW ME INTO A KIND OF TRANCE THAT HE WAS EXERTING ALL HIS POWER AND KNOWLEDGE
STILL ANOTHER WEEK WENT BY
YOU SHALL PRAY TO DIE AND DEATH SHALL NOT COME
YOU DARE NOT COULD NOT TAKE ANY NECESSARY STEPS
BUT WHAT DID YOU HEAR I COULD NOT CATCH ALL THEY SAID
FOR REMEMBER WHAT I TELL YOU IS TRUE
EVIDENTLY THEY WERE DEEPLY MOVED
IF EVER HATE AND CRUELTY WERE EXPRESSED IN ANY HUMAN FACE THEY WERE EXPRESSED IN HIS
I HAVE SOME IDEA OF STUMBLING ALONG WITH TOM ON ONE SIDE OF ME AND VOLTAIRE ON THE OTHER BUT NO WORD WAS SPOKEN UNTIL WE CAME TO TEMPLE HALL
I MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT FORGETTING AND THEN LIKE A MAN IN A SLEEP I PUT ON MY HAT AND COAT AND WENT OUT I KNOW NOT WHERE
I THOUGHT I'D BETTER TELL EE YER HONOUR AND THEN YOU'D KNOW OW TO ACT I THANKED SIMON HEARTILY
SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN SPOKE
CHAPTER V CHRISTMAS NIGHT--THE FORGING OF THE CHAIN YOU HAVE MORE THAN REDEEMED YOUR PROMISE VOLTAIRE SAID TOM TEMPLE AFTER A SILENCE THAT WAS ALMOST PAINFUL
AH IF YOU WILL NOT
B-O-L-O--AH THAT'S IT
AT THAT MOMENT I BECAME POSSESSED OF A TERRIBLE PASSION
IF HE WERE IN CAIRO HE WAS HIDING
I WAS SOON DRESSED AND READY TO GO DOWN BUT ON LOOKING AT MY WATCH I FOUND I HAD AN HOUR TO SPARE BEFORE BREAKFAST
ARRIVED AT PARIS I WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED
TELL EE YER ONOUR I SHALL BELIEVE IN GHOSTS AND SPERRITS AGAIN SOON
IT MIGHT BE ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE LONG AND PERHAPS ONE-SIXTH OF A MILE WIDE
NO HE SAID
MY THOUGHTS WERE EVER RUNNING AWAY TO YORKSHIRE AND ON THE PLEASANT TIME I HOPED TO SPEND
THE FIRST QUESTION THAT WILL BE ASKED WILL BE WHY YOU HAVE REFRAINED FROM TELLING SO LONG FOR HE WHO SHELTERS A CRIMINAL BY SILENCE IS REGARDED AS AN AIDER AND AN ABETTOR OF THAT CRIMINAL
I WANT TO BE SHOWN TO THE ROOM WHERE SHE IS WITHOUT HER BEING APPRISED OF MY PRESENCE I DAREN'T HE REPLIED
I KNEW THE PROBABILITY WAS THAT I SHOULD BE FOLLOWED BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO GO WHEN I SEEMED TO HEAR VOICES ALL AROUND ME UTTERING THE WORDS DREARWATER POND WITH THAT I STARTED RUNNING WITH ALL MY MIGHT KNOWING NOT WHERE YET DIMLY REMEMBERING THAT I HAD GONE THE ROAD BEFORE
ANYHOW I CAN PROMISE YOU A JOLLY EVENING HAD I KNOWN THEN WHAT THAT EVENING WOULD LEAD TO I SHOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED THE HOUSE SO JOYOUSLY AS I DID
AND MISS FORREST'S AUNT TREMBLINGLY TOUCHED A BUTTON CLOSE BESIDE HER
RESIST
RESIST
IN HER HAND SHE CARRIED A LONG KNIFE WHICH WAS ALSO COVERED WITH BLOOD WHILE THE HAND WHICH HELD IT WAS RED
READY WITTED SHE WAS QUICK AT REPARTEE
WE HEARD MUCH ABOUT HER BEFORE WE CAME
I HAD NOT COME ON A FALSE REPORT
MERCY LADY
I WAS VERY SORRY I SAID AT LENGTH BUT YOU DID NOT WANT A COMPANION
KAFFAR HAD NOT BEEN AT THE CASINO
I STOOD AND WATCHED HIM UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT AND THEN TRIED TO COLLECT MY SCATTERED THOUGHTS
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING OVER THE SUBJECTS OF EXAMINATION AND WHAT ARE THEY
I DARE NOT
SHE DID NOT ANSWER ME BUT I FANCIED SHE BLUSHED
I SHALL SAY LITTLE OF THE JOURNEY
AND HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE THERE'S ANOTHER TRAIN TO DINGLEDALE JUNCTION I ASKED ANXIOUSLY
I PLAYED THREE TRUMP CARDS LAST NIGHT MR JUSTIN BLAKE
MY NOVEL WAS A FAILURE
THE HOTEL PROPRIETOR SAID HE SHOULD NOT HAVE REMEMBERED HIM BUT THAT HE HAD TALKED ARABIC WITH HIM
IT WAS NOT JUSTIN BLAKE WHO WAS THERE BUT SOMETHING ELSE WHICH WAS CALLED JUSTIN BLAKE AND THE FEELINGS THAT POSSESSED ME WERE SUCH AS I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF
THE PEOPLE TALK IN A STRANGE TONGUE
AH I SEE THE NAME NOW
PERHAPS YOU KNOW THIS HE SAID
HE DIDN'T COME NEAR ME NOR TOUCH ME AND I WUR SLEEPIN AFORE I COULD THINK OF MY GRANDMOTHER JUST SO
YET THE FUTURE LOOKED TERRIBLY DOUBTFUL
BUT I MUST NOT STAY TO WRITE ABOUT THIS FOR MY STORY IS NOT ABOUT ITALIAN SCENERY OR BEAUTIFUL SIGHTS OF ANY SORT
I HAD NOT BEEN THERE LONG BEFORE I HEARD VOICES AND LOOKING UP I SAW THE PARTY WALKING TOWARDS ME
YOU WILL NOT SPREAD SUCH A DECEPTIVE STORY ABOUT NO I REPLIED I WILL NOT
WERE YOU WITH KAFFAR LAST NIGHT AFTER HE HAD SO ABOMINABLY INSULTED YOU AND LEFT THE HOUSE I DO NOT KNOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS NOW NO NO IDEA WHATEVER NOT THE SLIGHTEST JUSTIN MY FRIEND THIS LOOKS VERY STRANGE
WE HAVE A JOLLY HOUSE AND YOU ENGLISHMEN WOULD ENJOY A FEW NIGHTS HERE
ONE THING SAVED ME FROM RUIN VIZ
THE INFLUENCE HAD GONE AND I WAS FREE
FIRST I THOUGHT THE CUSTOM A FOOLISH ONE AS WELL AS BEING HARMFUL
I AM NOT YOUR SLAVE I SAID
SILENTLY I WAITED FOR I SHOULD THINK HALF-AN-HOUR
THERE ARE FIVE PEOPLE IN YON CARRIAGE
IT WAS RARELY SHE SPOKE TO ME HOWEVER FOR SHE DWELT WITH THE UNSEEN AND TALKED WITH THE BURIED DEAD
YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING
ALTHOUGH I HAVE USED A PAGE OF GOOD PAPER IN DESCRIBING THEM I WAS ONLY A VERY FEW SECONDS IN SEEING AND REALIZING WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN
CAN YOU DRAW A SKETCH OF THE ROAD TO IT FROM THE RAILWAY STATION AND HE PUT A PIECE OF PAPER AND PENCIL IN SIMON'S HAND
GOD DID NOT CARE FOR THE BEINGS HE HAD MADE
AT ANY RATE SUCH WAS MY CONVICTION
PERHAPS MR BLAKE SEEING HE LONGS FOR TRUTH MAY LIKE TO DO THIS
NEXT MORNING WHEN I WAS PREPARING TO VISIT SCOTLAND YARD A SERVANT CAME INTO MY ROOM BEARING A CARD ON A TRAY
HONESTLY HOWEVER I DID NOT BELIEVE IN ONE WORD OF IT
IT COULD NOT BE
AT THAT MOMENT I REALIZED THAT I HAD GIVEN MY HEART TO GERTRUDE FORREST AND THAT ANOTHER MAN HAD DESIGNS CONCERNING HER
KNOW MAN THAT YOU ARE PUNISHABLE BY THE LAW OF ENGLAND HOW YOU ARE GUILTY OF MANY THINGS THAT I NEED NOT ENUMERATE HERE
THE FACES OF THE TWO MEN BECAME DIMMER AND DIMMER THE PEOPLE APPEARED TO FLOAT IN MID AIR AND I WITH THEM
I TRIED TO MAKE HIM EXPLAIN FURTHER BUT COULD NOT I'LL SEE SIMON AT ONCE I SAID
IT MIGHT BRING THIS VILLAIN UNDER SUSPICION AND IF SO IT WOULD HINDER HIM FROM EXACTING THE FULFILMENT OF GERTRUDE FORREST'S PROMISE
YOUR EVERY DESIRE SHALL BE GRANTED AND I WILL GIVE UP THAT WHICH IS DEAR TO ME AND IF I WILL NOT SHE SAID
IT CANNOT BE SAID MISS FORREST
BUT WHAT I HAVE SAID IS TRUE I SPOKE RAPIDLY PASSIONATELY AND I SAW THAT HER FACE BECAME ALTERNATELY PALE AND RED BUT SHE DID NOT REPLY
THE LODGING-HOUSE KEEPER HAD KEPT HIS WORD AND KAFFAR WOULD BE SAFE
I HAVE COME TO TELL YOU HE WENT ON THAT YOU CANNOT ESCAPE MY POWER THAT YOU CANNOT DISOBEY ME AND NOT SUFFER
I WALKED RAPIDLY ON IN SILENCE
I FOUND IN MY COMPANION ONE WHO WAS IN EVERY WAY DELIGHTFUL
WAS PROFESSOR VIRCHOW AT HOME
SURELY THERE WAS MORE THAN COMMON INTEREST BETRAYED IN HER VOICE
BUT I LISTENED TO SOME FOOLISH GOSSIP ABOUT YOUR BOASTING OF YOUR CONQUESTS WITH LADIES AND THE LIKE
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS I SAID
OH IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW I HAVE PRAYED AND HOPED AND THOUGHT AND I HAD A PROMISE TOO I SAID
EVERY ONE ELSE THINKS THAT KAFFAR HAS GONE BACK TO EGYPT AS HE SAID AND ESPECIALLY SO AS VOLTAIRE HAS BEEN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIS LUGGAGE TO BE SENT TO CAIRO THIS IS ASTOUNDING
THERE WILL ONLY WANT EIGHT CLEAR DAYS TO CHRISTMAS EVE I CAN'T HELP THAT SIR SAID THE LITTLE PROFESSOR TESTILY
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN MR TEMPLE I DO NOT THINK TOM SHOULD HAVE ENCOURAGED THEIR SUPERSTITION BY TELLING THEM BUT HE DID
I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A TRAIN LEAVING ABOUT MIDNIGHT WHICH TRAVELLED NORTHWARD ONE THAT HAD BEEN RUNNING SOME YEARS
I SAW SOMETHING LYING ON THE GROUND AND ON PICKING IT UP FOUND IT TO BE A SCARF WHICH KAFFAR HAD BEEN WEARING THIS VERY NIGHT
STILL I WAS NOT FIT TO BE HER HUSBAND
BUT SHE HAS A SOUL ABOVE FORMALITIES AND SO DETERMINED TO COME AND TAKE CARE OF HER NIECE THE YOUNG LADY MADE NO REPLY
SHE'S BEEN COOL ENOUGH TO DRIVE HIM AWAY SAID THAT ERE MISS STAGGLES
THE CONDITION OF THE CHRISTIANS WHOM NERO USED AS TORCHES SHALL BE HEAVEN TO WHAT YOURS SHALL BE
IT IS YOU
SIMON SLOWDEN IS IN THE OUSE IF YOU SHOULD WANT HELP SUR I DID NOT FEEL MUCH INCLINED TO TALK AFTER THIS AND SO DISMISSING SIMON I BEGAN TO THINK OF HOW MATTERS STOOD
IF I FAILED MY LOVE WOULD MARRY THE MAN WHO WAS WORSE THAN A FIEND WHILE I FOR WHOM SHE WAS TO SUFFER THIS TORTURE WAS UNABLE TO HELP HER
HER SKIN WAS DARK AND CLEAR HER EYES VERY DARK HER MOUTH PLEASANT YET DECIDED HER CHIN SQUARE AND DETERMINED
HE IS NO ORDINARY MAN
MONDAY NIGHT CAME
WHAT IS YOUR WILL NOW THIS
MY MIND REFUSED TO WORK
HIS EYES HAD A VACANT LOOK ABOUT THEM AND YET THERE SEEMED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INTELLIGENCE DISPLAYED--AT ANY RATE IT SEEMED SO TO ME
STAY
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER IF I COULD HAVE ALLOWED HIM STILL TO THINK I WAS IN HIS POWER BUT THE TEMPTATION TO SHOW HIM MY FREEDOM WAS TOO STRONG
BUT I HAVE ONLY JUST AWOKE I THOUGHT I MUST COME
IT WAS VERY UNFORTUNATE FOR YOU THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE MATCHED YOURSELF WITH SUCH A ONE
HER EVERY WORD AND ACTION DISCLAIMED THE IDEA OF HER BEING A COQUETTE WHILE HER HONEST PREFERENCE FOR MY SOCIETY WAS APPARENT
AT ANY RATE IT WERE HEAVEN TO THINK SO
IT WAS SNOW--SNOW EVERYWHERE
NEARLY ALL ARE EDUCATED IN ONE GROOVE UNTIL THERE IS IN THE ENGLISH MIND AN AMOUNT OF SAMENESS THAT BECOMES MONOTONOUS YOU ARE SPEAKING OF THE EDUCATION OF LADIES MR VOLTAIRE SAID MISS EMERY
SUFFICE IT TO SAY I WAS IN A STATE OF FEVERISH ANXIETY WHEN WE DROVE UP TO THE PROFESSOR'S DOOR THAT NIGHT ABOUT HALF-PAST NINE
YER HONOUR HE SAID I DON'T FEEL AS IF I CAN TALK ABOUT HER
THE TWO WORK TOGETHER AND BOTH ARE CUNNING AS SERPENTS
WHY I DO NOT WISH YOU TO SEARCH FOR HIM IS THAT THEREBY YOU MIGHT FIND OUT THINGS ABOUT ME THAT I DO NOT WISH YOU TO DO
I WILL TRY TO DESCRIBE THE MORE STRIKING OF THE TWO FIRST
INNOCENT
WE HAD NOT GOT FAR INTO FRANCE HOWEVER WHEN WE FOUND EVERYTHING CHANGED
STARTED BOUT HALF-AN-HOUR AGO ANY MESSAGE FOR ME THE GUV'NOR TOLD ME IF I SAW YER TO TELL YER WHERE THEY'D GONE WHO WENT WITH MR TEMPLE MISS GRAY AND THE OTHER LADY YER HONOUR HE HAD LED OUT THE HORSE BY THIS TIME AND I WAS PREPARING TO MOUNT IT WHEN I SAW THAT HE HAD SOMETHING MORE TO COMMUNICATE
SHOULD I YIELD MY DARLING TO VOLTAIRE
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN HUNG UPON HIS EVERY WORD
IT'S RUINED MY BLOOD AND WEAKENED MY BRAIN
DID HE SEE KAFFAR
I FELT SUPREMELY HAPPY AS I RODE BY MISS FORREST'S SIDE
FOR EXAMPLE A MAN VERSED IN THE SECRETS OF THE SPIRIT LIFE CAN CAUSE THE SOUL OF ANY HUMAN BEING TO LEAVE ITS CLAY TENEMENT AND GO TO THE WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEARN ITS SECRETS
I WAS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT YOU BE THROWN INTO A MESMERIC SLEEP
HE SPOKE FRENCH ENOUGH TO MAKE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD AND AS HIS HOST WAS PROFICIENT IN THAT LANGUAGE FRENCH WAS THE TONGUE IN WHICH THEY CONVERSED
WELL T SEEMS TO ME AS OW IT MUST HEV BIN SPECIAL PROVIDENCE AS HEV BROUGHT US TOGETHER AS WE READ IN THE BOOK OF JOB
I HAD BEEN LEFT AN ORPHAN JUST BEFORE I CAME OF AGE AND WAS THUS CAST UPON THE WORLD AT A TIME WHEN IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS FOR YOUNG MEN TO BE ALONE
BUT YOU COULD NOT BE DEPENDED ON
I WALKED ON TOWARDS WESTMINSTER ABBEY STILL WORKING OUT MY NEWLY CONCEIVED IDEA AND WHEN THERE JUMPED INTO A CAB
BUT SURELY SUCH NONSENSE IS NOT BELIEVED IN NOW THESE THINGS ARE NOT NONSENSE SAID VOLTAIRE
HAS ANY ONE BEEN ASKING FOR ME ASKED KAFFAR
HE'S SPEAKING FRENCH
CHAPTER XVIII NEARING THE END THERE WERE AS I SAID EIGHT DAYS IN WHICH TO FIND KAFFAR AND BRING HIM TO LONDON COUNTING THE DAY ON WHICH WE STARTED OUR JOURNEY
EVIDENTLY OUR THOMAS IS AFRAID SAID MISS STAGGLES
HE CAME BACK JUST AFTER THEY'D GONE AND WENT RIDIN EFTER EM LIKE GREASED LIGHTNIN FOR A MINUTE I WAS STUNNED
FOR TWO LONG HOURS I FELT THIS STRANGE INFLUENCE AND THEN IT CEASED
I WAS LIVING A DUAL LIFE
BUT HE LOOKS ALL STRANGE
MEANWHILE HER MOTHER ASSURED ME THAT HER HOUSE WAS CONVENIENT AND COMFORTABLE AND ASKED PERMISSION TO SHOW ME SOME VACANT ROOMS AND GIVE ME AN IDEA OF THE ATTENDANCE I SHOULD RECEIVE
I LOOKED AT MY WATCH AND IT WAS ALMOST TOO DARK FOR ME TO DISCERN THE TIME BUT I SAW AFTER SOME DIFFICULTY THAT IT WANTED BUT A FEW MINUTES TO FIVE
WHAT MOTIVE I ASKED COULD KAFFAR HAVE IN CONNECTING ME WITH THE GHOST AND WHAT WAS THE PLOT WHICH WAS BEING CONCOCTED
MY WILL WAS NOW STRONGER THAN HIS AND BY EXERCISING THAT WILL I WAS ABLE TO RESIST HIM
DO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT MAN SHE SAID HURRIEDLY AND THEN RAN INTO THE HOUSE
MECHANICALLY I BOUGHT A PAPER ONE OF THE LEADING DAILIES
I DID NOT KNOW KAFFAR KNEW FRENCH
I CANNOT SPEAK HIGHLY OF THE RANK AND FILE OF THE PEOPLE THERE
AND YET I WAS NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT HOPE
YOU ARE GOING TO BE FREE
GOD KNOWS HOW GLADLY I WOULD BE WITH YOU BUT IT MUST NOT BE
BUT WE MUST NOT BE SEEN TOGETHER LIKE THIS OR THEY WILL SUSPECT SOMETHING TRUE SAYS HE BUT I WANT TO KNOW HOW THINGS ARE GOIN ON THEN HE STOPPED A MINIT AND A THOUGHT SEEMED TO STRIKE HIM
I WAS FREE AND I KNEW IT
SIT HERE AS SIMON DID AND SEE WHETHER YOU ARE RIGHT I THOUGHT I HEARD A VOICE SAYING DON'T CLOSE TO MY EAR AND I HESITATED
HE SHALL NOT BE MENTIONED WITH LOATHING AND WHAT THEN I CRIED
THIS MAN HAD BECOME THE CENTRE OF ATTRACTION
WHAT WAS HIS PURPOSE IN GETTING AT A CORRECT ESTIMATE OF MISS FORREST'S CHARACTER
BUT THE MOMENT I APPEARED ON THE SCENE HER SMILE WAS GONE AND IF OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED SHE GENERALLY SOUGHT OCCASION TO LEAVE
SHOULD I RENOUNCE MY LIFE'S LOVE
IF YOU HAD KNOWN GIRLS AS LONG AS I YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THEY USUALLY MAKE FRIENDS AND CONFIDANTES OF EACH OTHER
I FELT THAT HE WAS ACTING IN SPITE OF THE TERRIBLE EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU
IN FACT I'M SURE HE HAS DARKNESS AND DEATH HE HAS
MY FRIEND JUSTIN COULD NEVER DO THIS THERE SHE CRIED TO VOLTAIRE
WE ARRIVED IN TURIN ON FRIDAY EVENING ABOUT FIFTY-ONE HOURS FROM THE TIME WE STARTED FROM LONDON
NOW IF YOU HAVE THE COURAGE OF A MAN WITH AN OPINION TEST THE MATTER
I CANNOT REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THE WALK
IT IS TRUE I CALL MYSELF A PROFESSOR OF MESMERISM AND CLAIRVOYANCE BUT IT WOULD BE MORE CORRECT TO CALL ME A PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGIST
STILL CONTINUED SIMON WITH A SLY LOOK I RECKON AS OW I'LL BE A MATCH FOR THAT ERE DOUBLY WACCINATED GHOST AS FRIGHTENED ME SO I COULD GET NOTHING MORE FROM HIM
IT SEEMED TO ME I HAD LIVED A LONG LIFE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
I TURNED AND SAW KAFFAR
HE HAD MADE ME A FREE AGENT AND I MUST ALLOW HIM TO POSSESS ME WHOLLY
HE GAVE A FIERCE SAVAGE LAUGH AND CLAPPED HIS HANDS CLOSE AGAINST MY FACE
HE HAD EITHER FOUND HE COULD DO NO GOOD BY HIS MESMERIC INFLUENCES OR ELSE HE HAD LOST THEM AND SO HE WAS WORKING UP SOME OTHER SCHEME AGAINST ME
SHE HAS A LARGE FORTUNE
BUT TO ME IT LOOKS MIGHTY SUSPICIOUS AS I SAID TO MY SWEETHEART WHEN I SEE HER A-HUGGIN AND KISSIN THE COACHMAN I WENT AWAY LAUGHING BUT MY HEART WAS STILL HEAVY
BUT HE HAS NOT FORGOTTEN YOU
NOT THAT
I COULD NOT BY ANY MEANS SPEAK IT FLUENTLY BUT I KNEW IT ENOUGH TO ENTER INTO AN ORDINARY CONVERSATION
BUT I MIGHT BE WORSE THAN THAT
SURELY I HAD BEEN GUIDED ARIGHT
GOODNESS WAS NOT THE STRONGEST FORCE
I AM A CHILD OF THE EAST AND BELIEVE IN THE TRUTHS THAT ARE TAUGHT THERE
THERE WAS ONE THING IN MY FAVOUR
PRAY WHY SHE ONLY SHOOK HER HEAD
FIRST IT WAS A GOOD HOTEL
HE WAS A LITTLE MAN ABOUT FIVE FEET FOUR INCHES HIGH
I HAVE HAD A TERRIBLE EXISTENCE
STILL IT WAS A WELL-PLANNED AFFAIR
I HAD DONE I KNEW NOT WHAT
WHY DON'T YOU GET AN INFLUENCE OVER HER AS YOU DID OVER BLAKE
I DO NOT BELIEVE IN MADE-UP GHOSTS
I COULD NOT STAND AND PLAY THE EAVESDROPPER
UNDOUBTEDLY THE EGYPTIAN KNEW TOO MUCH FOR VOLTAIRE AND SO I WAS MADE A TOOL WHEREBY HE COULD BE FREED FROM TROUBLESOME OBSTACLES
THERE WAS AN UGLY LOOK IN HER EYES AS SHE SAID THIS BUT THE TITTER INCREASED INTO A KIND OF DERISIVE LAUGH
MR TEMPLE HAS BEEN TELLING SOME STRANGE STORIES ABOUT IT
OH I AM NOT HIS FRIEND NOW
THE MIND OF MY FRIEND KAFFAR WILL BE BY A SECRET POWER MERGED INTO MINE
AT LENGTH A STRANGE LIGHT SHOT FROM HIS EYES AND HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND SPOKE
AND HIS POWER WAS EVIL HIS MOTIVES WERE FIENDISH HIS NATURE WAS DEPRAVED
CAN'T YOU SEE HOW SHE SCORNS YOU HATES YOU LOATHES YOU
PERHAPS HOWEVER I AM USING A WRONG EXPRESSION
I KNEW HE WAS WEIGHING ME TESTING ME AND SEEKING TO ESTIMATE MY POWERS BUT BEING ON MY GUARD HIS SUCCESS WAS LIMITED
WAS HE OR HAD HE BEEN THERE
YES SAID VOLTAIRE
HE WAS PERFECTLY SELF-POSSESSED STOOD STRAIGHT AND HAD A SOLDIER-LIKE BEARING
I FOUND ON DESCENDING THAT NEARLY ALL HAD BREAKFASTED BUT THE FEW WITH WHOM I SPOKE WERE VERY KIND AND PLEASANT TOWARDS ME
HE CALCULATED UPON THE YOUNG LADY'S SUPERSTITIOUS FANCIES
DURING THIS TIME I HAD FELT ENTIRELY FREE FROM ANY OF THE STRANGE INFLUENCES I HAVE DESCRIBED AND I BEGAN TO WONDER AT IT
THERE COULD BE NOTHING GAINED BY IT AND YET I WAS SURE THAT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT MEANING
IT SEEMED AS IF WE HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS AND THUS IT WAS NATURAL FOR US TO CONVERSE FREELY
WHAT HAD I DONE
NEVER SAYS HE
ANYHOW I FOR ONE LIKE TANGIBLE PROOF BEFORE I BELIEVE IN ANYTHING THAT DOES NOT APPEAL TO MY REASON
THEN I GAVE AN AWFUL SHUDDER
WHAT WAS I
STILL IT WAS MY ONLY HOPE AND IT ONLY WANTED EIGHT DAYS TO CHRISTMAS EVE
GIVE EM TO ME SAYS I
THERE WAS NO SATISFACTION IN THE YOUNG LADY'S FACE HOWEVER AND SHE TURNED WITH WHAT I THOUGHT AN ANGRY LOOK TOWARDS THE SCRAWNY DUENNA WHO HAD CLAIMED GUARDIANSHIP OVER HER AND SAID BUT MISS STAGGLES YOU ARE IN A FALSE POSITION
MY FACULTIES WERE RAPIDLY RETURNING TO ME YET I STOOD AS ONE IN A DREAM
HE SMILED ON ME AND LIFTED HIS HAT POLITELY
IT WAS NOT FOR ME TO BUILD CASTLES IN THE AIR AND WEAVE BRIGHT FANCIES
ONE ALMOST HATES HIM AND YET ONE IS OBLIGED TO ADMIRE HIM
BUT TWEEN YOU AND ME AND THE GATEPOST YON HINFIDEL HAIN'T A SERVED ME LIKE HE HEV YOU
IT IS NO USE DENYING THE FACT FOR MY SECRET MUST SOONER OR LATER DROP OUT
SEVEN IS A PERFECT NUMBER AND ALL THE EASTERNS TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION AND IT IS A LAW THAT NO ONE SHALL REVEAL A SECRET THAT THEY MAY HAVE FOUND UNTIL THREE TIMES SEVEN YEARS PASS OVER THEIR HEADS
A STRANGE FEELING BEGAN TO CREEP OVER ME
COULD I HAVE KILLED HIM
AND SO I WENT QUIETLY TO BED AND MUCH TO MY ASTONISHMENT SLEPT LONG AND SOUNDLY
I CANNOT REMEMBER MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SAID
HE HAS LEFT THE COUNTRY AND WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN BUT I AM HERE I SAID DISTINCTLY
AS FOR HIM HE SAT WITH HIS EYES FIXED AS IF HE SAW BEYOND THE PRESENT TIME AND PLACE WHILE HIS FACE WAS LIKE A PIECE OF MARBLE
MY LITTLE SPARK OF FAITH BEGAN TO DIE
SOON AFTER I SEE YOU WITH A BOOTIFUL YOUNG LADY AND I SEE THAT HINFIDEL A-WATCHIN YER WITH A SNAKY LOOK IN HIS EYES
COULD HE NOT MAKE MY FRIEND SAY NOT WHAT REALLY EXISTED BUT WHAT EXISTED IN HIS OWN MIND
I WAS SURE NOW THAT SHE LOVED ME
I--I DO NOT KNOW BUT YOU HAVE BEEN TOGETHER HAVE WE I SAID VACANTLY
STORIES WERE TOLD OLD BALLADS WERE SUNG WHILE ROGER DE COVERLEY WAS DANCED IN DOWNRIGHT EARNEST BY MOST OF THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT
WILL YOU EXPLAIN I CANNOT MISS FORREST
I GOT AN OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO MISS FORREST BUT ONLY FOR A VERY SHORT TIME
MEANWHILE CONSIDER YOURSELF FORTUNATE
IF THERE'S TO BE DEATH FOR ANY ONE SHE WEARS A SHROUD
IT WAS AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN I RETIRED TO REST BUT I COULD NOT SLEEP
THAT SHE USUALLY APPEARS ON NEW YEAR'S NIGHT
BUT TO WORK UNTIL I HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE WORK I HAD SET OUT TO DO
WHERE WAS HE THEN
BUT WE ENGLISH PEOPLE POSSESS THE RIGHT OF OUR OPINIONS
IT IS NOT TRUE SHE CRIED
AND YET A THOUSAND THINGS JUSTIFIED THE ACT
THIS WOULD DO SPLENDIDLY
I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK O THINGS YER HONOUR WHY SIMON WHY SIR TAIN'T ME AS OUGHT TO TELL AND YET I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
WE TALKED AND LAUGHED GAILY ESPECIALLY AS TOM WAS PREPARING FOR HIS WEDDING WITH MISS EDITH GRAY AND WHEN I TOLD MRS TEMPLE HOW TOM HAD POPPED THE QUESTION ON THE LANDING AT MIDNIGHT AFTER THE APPEARANCE OF THE FAMOUS HALL GHOST THE MERRIMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS
I WOULD PROCLAIM THE STORY TO EVERY ONE
THEN IT CEASED TO FEEL TO BE A DUTY TO RID GERTRUDE OF VOLTAIRE
PROMISE ME TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM
YOU KILLED MY FRIEND
I CAN REMEMBER NOTHING DISTINCTLY AND YET I HAVE THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT I NEVER STRUCK HIM A BLOW AND I TOO AM SURE YOU DID NOT DO THIS JUSTIN REPLIED TOM
SHE WEREN'T A MINNIT AFORE SHE WUR OUT MR BLAKE A-CARRYIN SOMETHIN IN HER HANDS
WE CAME TO THE GREAT SQUARE IN WHICH STOOD THE PALACE OF THE KING BUT I PAID NO HEED TO THE IMPOSING BUILDING NOR TO THE MAGNIFICENTLY CARVED MONUMENTS THAT STOOD AROUND IN THE SQUARE
THEN HE LOOKED TOWARDS MISS FORREST AND AGAIN A LOOK OF INTELLIGENCE PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE EGYPTIAN
AND THEN BEFORE I HAD TIME TO REPLY HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND WALKED AWAY
I'M PURTY TOUGH
IF YOU STAY HERE AFTER TO-MORROW OR ATTEMPT TO SEE ME WITHIN THIS AND NEXT CHRISTMAS EVE MY PROMISE IS ALSO FORFEITED WHAT AM I TO LEAVE YOU AT ONCE AT ONCE HE LEFT THE ROOM IMMEDIATELY AFTER SAID TOM WHILE AFTER SAYING GOOD-NIGHT TO ME SHE TOO RETIRED TO HER BEDROOM TO SAY THAT I WAS ASTONISHED AT THE TURN THINGS HAD TAKEN WOULD NOT GIVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF MY FEELINGS
BETWEEN THE LINES ON MY PAPER I WAS EVER SEEING THE OLD BARONIAL HALL THAT WAS TOM TEMPLE'S HOME AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN INVITED TO SPEND THE FESTIVE SEASON THERE
I DETERMINED TO GO TO YORKSHIRE AND SOON FOUND MYSELF WITHIN THE HOSPITABLE WALLS OF TEMPLE HALL
I AM AS IGNORANT AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THE GHOST AS HE IS PERHAPS MORE SO INSTANTLY KAFFAR LEAPT FROM HIS CHAIR AND CAME UP TO ME HIS HANDS CLENCHED HIS BLACK EYES GLEAMING HIS TEETH SET TOGETHER AS IF IN A TERRIBLE RAGE
NO I REPLIED
AND WHAT I HAVE SEEN TO-NIGHT WILL BE EVER A MATTER OF MARVEL AS WELL AS THANKFULNESS THAT I HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO SEE IT THIS WAS EVIDENTLY THE OPINION OF EVERY ONE IN THE ROOM
BUT OH I AM AFRAID MY FRIEND MY ONLY FRIEND LIES MURDERED AT THE BOTTOM OF DREARWATER POND AND MURDERED BY MR BLAKE IT CANNOT BE CRIED MISS FORREST
T-O-R-I-N-O
I FELT MY HEAD WHIRLING AROUND WHILE STREAMS OF ICY WATER SEEMED TO BE RUNNING DOWN MY LEGS
LOOK MR BLAKE
I THINK MY FAILING IS TO FORM HASTY JUDGMENTS CONCERNING PEOPLE WHICH OF COURSE CANNOT BE FAIR I SAID THIS RATHER STAMMERINGLY WHILE SHE WATCHED ME KEENLY
SO FAR NOT ONE STEP HAD BEEN TAKEN TO PROVE WHETHER KAFFAR WAS DEAD OR ALIVE AND ALTHOUGH I KNEW NOTHING OF A DETECTIVE'S BUSINESS I DID NOT LIKE TAKING ANY ONE INTO MY CONFIDENCE
WHAT THEN IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED
WHAT I AM NOW GOING TO WRITE MAY APPEAR FOOLISH AND UNREAL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU REMEMBER THAT I WAS THIRTY YEARS OF AGE BUT THE MOMENT I SAW HIS ARDENT ADMIRING GAZE I FELT MADLY JEALOUS
THE ELDER LADY SAT BOLT UPRIGHT OPPOSITE THE YOUNGER AND BEGAN TO HARANGUE HER
IN THE PSALMS OF SOLOMON IT READS RESIST THE DEVIL AND HE'LL GO AWAY HOWLIN WELL I'VE RESISTED THAT ERE DEVIL AND HE WOULDN'T GO AWAY TILL HE'D KNOWED AS HOW HE'D PLAYED HIS LITTLE GAME AND SIMON LOOKED VERY SOLEMN INDEED
WHERE MR TEMPLE AND I DID NOT LIKE THE LOOK ON HIS FACE AND WE FOLLOWED HIM
THIS DETERMINATION I AT ONCE CARRIED INTO PRACTICE AND IN A LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK I AGAIN SAW THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER
THIS AS MAY BE IMAGINED GRIEVED ME MUCH
HER EVERY WORD GAVE ME HOPE IN SPITE OF MYSELF
I EXPECTED THIS HE SAID BUT I WILL TRY HELFA THE EXPERIMENT WITH HELFA HOWEVER WAS JUST AS FRUITLESS
THIS"--HOLDING UP THE NECKCLOTH
THE TERRIBLE NIGHT ON THE YORKSHIRE MOORS CAME BACK AGAIN THE DARK FORBIDDING WATERS THE GHASTLY RED HAND THE GLEAMING KNIFE THE STRUGGLE--ALL WERE REAL
SOMEHOW IT WAS CONNECTED WITH VOLTAIRE'S SCHEME
NOW HOWEVER I COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF OTHER MATTERS
THEN HE SAID THERE'S A HANCIENT WIRGIN ERE CALLED MISS STAGGLES AIN'T THERE MR BLAKE THERE IS
WE HAVE COME A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE THEY SURELY ARE I SAID
YES AS INNOCENT AS NERO OR ROBESPIERRE
THE COMING OF THE NIGHT XI
EVIDENTLY THEY WERE BEHIND SOME LARGE LAUREL BUSHES WHICH HID THEM FROM MY SIGHT
THIS MUST BE LEFT TO THEIR OWN IMAGINATION
HE'S A SPY YER HONOUR A REG'LAR JUDAS ISCARIOT
YER NAG IS SADDLED SUR HE SAID
BUT IT WAS IN WHISPERS SO LOW THAT I COULD NOT CATCH A WORD
YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE IT TRUE BUT I WOULD GIVE MUCH TO KNOW WHAT ILFRA THE UNDERSTANDING ONE KNEW
YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHO I AM I SAID
BESIDES TO-DAY WHEN I SEE YOU RIDE HOFF WITH THE YOUNG LADY I THINKS TO MYSELF THERE'S NO KNOWIN WHAT TIME HE'LL BE BACK I KNOW WHAT TIS YER HONOUR
ESPECIALLY WAS THIS REALIZED WHEN I KNEW THAT OUR TRAIN WAS HOURS LATE AND I KNEW THAT DID WE NOT ARRIVE IN PARIS AT SOMETHING LIKE REASONABLE TIME WE SHOULD MISS THE EXPRESS TRAINS FOR ENGLAND
I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE AND MY VENGEANCE IS JUST TRY AS I MIGHT I COULD NOT HELP SHUDDERING AT THIS
HIS GROUND WAS CUT FROM UNDER HIM
THE FORMER FIXED HIS TERRIBLE EYE UPON ME AS IF HE WOULD PEER INTO MY VERY SOUL
I WAS NOT SURE BECAUSE YOU HAD YOUR TRAVELLING CAP PULLED OVER YOUR FACE HOW STRANGE THOUGH THAT WE WERE BOTH BOUND FOR THE SAME PLACE I SAID
SIMON DECLARED THAT HE DAR'N'T GO INTO THE DINING-ROOM AMO THE SWELLS LIKE
WELL I SHOULD NOT THINK IT WAS A VITAL PART OF HIS PLAN BUT IT WAS HELPFUL
BUT AS FOR THE DEED ITSELF I KNOW NOT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SHE SAID
DO YOU KNOW WHAT COUNTRY THE TOWN IS IN NO SAID SIMON SHAKING HIS HEAD
HAS A STRONG LOVE FOR MYSTERY SO MUCH SO THAT SHE IS IN SOME THINGS A TRIFLE SUPERSTITIOUS I CAN'T SAY AS TO THAT BUT I SHOULD THINK YOU ARE CORRECT THEN SHE'S A YOUNG LADY OF VERY STRONG LIKES AND DISLIKES BUT AT BOTTOM IS OF A VERY AFFECTIONATE NATURE AFFECTIONATE TO NEARLY EVERY ONE BUT ME MUTTERED MISS STAGGLES
IS THAT ALL I SAID
LET'S OFF AT ONCE YER HONOUR CRIED SIMON
I NEVER SPEAK OF A SACRED THING JESTINGLY WE WERE ALL SILENT
I ACCORDINGLY FOLLOWED HER AND FOUND ROOMS WHICH WHILE NOT ALTOGETHER ACCORDING TO MY ENGLISH TASTES DID HER CREDIT
YOU STUDY THE SAME SUBJECTS AND THUS WHAT ONE OF YOU KNOWS ALL KNOW AND WHAT MAY BE YOUR IDEAS CONCERNING EDUCATION SAID MISS FORREST
WHEN KAFFAR AND I ENTERED THIS VILLAGE SHE WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS OF AGE AND WAS FAIR TO LOOK UPON
THERE HE'S CLOSED HIS EYES--HE'S OFF TO SLEEP THE PROFESSOR TURNED TO ME
HE HAD FORMED SOME NOTION ABOUT THE APPARITION WHICH HE WOULD NOT DIVULGE SO WE DEVOTED OUR ATTENTION TO SPORT AND AFTER FRIGHTENING A GOOD MANY RABBITS WE RETURNED TO THE HALL
AFTER THAT THEY WERE SILENT FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SHE SAYS TO HIM I BELIEVE SHE KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE WANTING TO DO AND HAS SOME IDEA OF THE INFLUENCE YOU HAVE EXERTED OVER HIM
THE MAN IS NOT VERY SUSCEPTIBLE SAID VOLTAIRE CONSEQUENTLY I CANNOT DO SO MUCH WITH HIM AS I SHOULD HAD HE BEEN MORE HIGHLY ORGANIZED
MR TEMPLE TOLD ME OF YOUR INTERVIEW TOGETHER LAST NIGHT A SLIGHT FLUSH CAME TO HER FACE
HE TOOK UP MY POINTS VERY QUICKLY SAW WHAT I WANTED WITHOUT ANY LENGTHENED EXPLANATIONS AND EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO SERVE ME
I DO NOT WEAVE THIS OUT OF MY OWN BRAIN LIKE YOUR AVERAGE ENGLISH NOVELIST HAS TO DO I FANCIED THIS WAS DIRECTED AT ME
MINE CRIED THIS GAUNT OLD WOMAN
SO FAR SO GOOD
THEY BURNED LIKE TWO COALS OF FIRE
I GAVE THIS DETECTIVE A DESCRIPTION OF VOLTAIRE TOLD HIM HIS ADDRESS WHICH I HAD ASCERTAINED THROUGH HIS LETTERS TO TEMPLE HALL AND EXPLAINED MY WISHES TO HIM
CHAPTER XII A MIDNIGHT CONFERENCE SOME ONE WAS KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
HE HAD ALSO TRAVELLED WITH SEVERAL SHOWS TWO OR THREE TRAVELLING THEATRES AND HAD FINALLY SETTLED DOWN WITH A LAME LEG AT TEMPLE HALL WHERE HE MADE HIMSELF GENERALLY USEFUL
I WAS STILL ENSLAVED
YOU THINK HE CONTINUED BECAUSE YOU HAVE REALIZED SOME IMMUNITY FROM THE POWER I WIELD THAT I HAVE LEFT YOU
WHO DO YOU MEAN ASKED TOM
I DO NOT COMPREHEND IN THE LEAST
I TREMBLED LIKE AN ASPEN LEAF
I AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT SIMON HAD SPENT HIS BOYHOOD IN LONDON HAD WHEN A YOUTH JOINED A TRAVELLING CIRCUS AND TRAMPED THE COUNTRY FOR A FEW YEARS
THEN I MADE INQUIRIES FOR THE BOOKING-CLERK WHO PRESENTLY MADE HIS APPEARANCE
I SUPPOSE THAT I TOO MUST HAVE BEEN HAGGARD FOR SHE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW ME
TWAS ON CHRISTMAS EVE WE FIRST MET IN ENGLAND--THEN YOU WILL PROMISE TO BE MY WIFE I PROMISE AND YOUR PROMISE SHALL BE IRREVOCABLE SHE TURNED ON HIM WITH SCORN
WILL YOU NOT THINK OF MY HAPPINESS A LITTLE
I THINK I AM ILL MEN USUALLY ARE WHEN THEY HAVE DONE WHAT YOU HAVE HE SAID
WHEN I CAME TO THE SPOT HOWEVER THOSE I HOPED TO FIND WERE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN AND SO GUIDING THE HORSE UP TO THE DARK WATERS I STOOD AND LOOKED AT THE LITTLE LAKE THAT BORE SUCH A SOMBRE NAME
IF I FAILED WELL I COULD NOT HELP IT
GLAD TO SEE YER HONOUR SAID SIMON HASTILY
STRUGGLE
YOU ASK ME TO GIVE UP WHAT IS NOW THE DEAREST OBJECT OF MY LIFE--EXCEPT ONE
I DID NOT THINK KAFFAR WOULD BE VERY PARTICULAR AS TO HIS SOCIETY AND HE WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO STAY AT THIS DISREPUTABLE PLACE THAN IN A RESPECTABLE LODGING-HOUSE
WHAT EXPECT YOU ABOU I SAID ANXIOUSLY
WE HAD BEEN TALKING I SHOULD THINK TEN MINUTES WHEN TOM TEMPLE CAME TOWARDS US
GOOD MEMORY
I DID NOT KNOW I COULD COME UNTIL HALF-AN-HOUR AGO HE SAID AS HE ENTERED AND THEN STARED AS HE SAW HOW MATTERS STOOD
BESIDES WHAT ABOUT THE BOOKING-CLERK THAT ISSUED A TICKET TO KAFFAR TWO HOURS AFTER YOU AND MR TEMPLE FOUND ME IT'S A LIE HE CRIED
I FEARED VOLTAIRE WITH A TERRIBLE FEAR
WEIGHTS SEEMED TO HANG UPON MY LIMBS BUT I FELT THE STRONGER OF THE TWO
THEN THE WIND BLEW COLDER AND I BEGAN TO WONDER HOW SOON THE JOURNEY WOULD END WHEN THE COLLECTOR CAME TO TAKE ALL THE TICKETS FROM THE LEEDS PASSENGERS
VENGEANCE IS ONE OF THE SWEETEST THOUGHTS TO AN EASTERN AND I MEANT TO BE AVENGED
DARK DREAMS AND NIGHT SHADOWS XII
YOU ARE GOING TO BE HAPPY HER WORDS NERVED ME
BY SOME MEANS HE HAD MADE ME THE SLAVE OF HIS WILL AND I HAD UNKNOWINGLY KILLED KAFFAR AND HE LIKE THE FIEND HE WAS HAD COME TO SWEEP ME OUT OF HIS ROAD
DO YOU REMEMBER A MAN COMING FOR A TICKET THAT NIGHT WHO STRUCK YOU AS PECULIAR WHAT KIND OF A MAN SIR A FOREIGNER
ARRIVING AT VICTORIA I DROVE STRAIGHT TO SCOTLAND YARD AND IN AN HOUR LATER TWO OF THE MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED OFFICERS OF THE LONDON DETECTIVE POLICE FORCE WERE IN POSSESSION OF ALL THE FACTS THAT I COULD GIVE THEM THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE EGYPTIAN PROVIDING HE LIVED
I THOUGHT I WOULD ALLOW YOU TO HAVE A GOOD BREAKFAST BEFORE SUMMONING YOU HE SAID ESPECIALLY AS THIS IS THE LAST CONVERSATION WE SHALL HAVE FOR SOME TIME I THOUGHT I DETECTED A LOOK OF TRIUMPH IN HIS EYES YET I WAS SURE HE REGARDED ME WITH INTENSE HATRED
HE HAD PARALYZED MY ENERGIES
THEY ARE MOSTLY OUT BUT THEY COME HOME AT NIGHT YES THEY COME HOME AT NIGHT ALL EXCEPT ONE WHICH WAS HE
HOW MANY THERE'S MISS FORREST HER AUNT AND MISS STAGGLES BESIDES A GENTLEMAN THAT CAME EARLY IN THE EVENING THAT GENTLEMAN'S NAME IS HEROD VOLTAIRE I SAID
I HAD TO FIND KAFFAR IF HE WAS TO BE FOUND AND THAT TO ME WAS AN AWFUL UNCERTAINTY AND I HAD TO BRING HIM TO GERTRUDE BEFORE THE NEXT CHRISTMAS EVE
I SUPPOSE YOU HAD BREAKFAST BEFORE YOU CAME HERE I ASSURED HIM THAT SIMON HAD BREAKFASTED ON KIDNEYS AND BACON
I COULD NOT HELP BEING CONSTITUTED AS I WAS NEITHER COULD VOLTAIRE HELP HIS NATURE
I FELT THAT HE WAS SIFTING ME FELT THAT HE WAS TRYING TO READ MY VERY SOUL AND YET I COULD NOT BREAK MYSELF FROM HIM
HEROD KILLED ONE OF YOUR CHRISTIAN SAINTS WHILE VOLTAIRE WAS AN INFIDEL
I WAS NOT DISPLEASED AT THIS
AS THE READER MAY GUESS I WAS HIGHLY ELATED AT THE TURN MATTERS WERE TAKING AND IN MY HEART I BEGAN TO LAUGH AT VOLTAIRE'S IDEA OF WINNING GERTRUDE FORREST
JUST BEFORE DINNER VOLTAIRE CAME TO ME AS IF HE WISHED TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION
SIMON I SAID AFTER SOME TIME HAVE YOU THOUGHT ANY MORE OF THE WONDERFUL GHOST THAT YOU SAW LAST NIGHT INSTANTLY HIS FACE TURNED PALE AND HE SHUDDERED AS IF IN FEAR
AND HE MIGHT BE LYING IN DREARWATER POND EVEN THEN
I DID NOT THINK HE WOULD POSSESS VERY MUCH MONEY AND A MAN OF HIS TEMPERAMENT WOULD DEVISE SOME MEANS OF GETTING SOME
MEANWHILE I MUST ACT AND THAT QUICKLY
THINGS IS LOOKING CURIOUS YER HONOUR INDEED SIMON
ONLY THE DIVINE POWER IN THE LIFE OF THE VICTIM CAN MAKE HIM POSSESS A POWER SUPERIOR TO THE MESMERIST'S
SPEAK LIGHTLY OF HER I CONTINUED AND I WILL THRASH YOU LIKE A DOG AS WELL AS THAT CUR WHO FOLLOWS AT YOUR HEELS FOR A MOMENT MY WILL HAD SEEMED TO GAIN THE MASTERY OVER HIM
NOW HE SAID WHAT DO YOU SEE BUT SIMON DID NOT REPLY
AND THEN WHEN HE COMES WE'LL--BUT WHAT NAME SHALL I WRITE ON MY MESSAGE HEROD VOLTAIRE I SAID
IT HAS FAILED ME IN THE PAST BUT IT WILL BE PERCHANCE MORE POTENT IN THE PRESENCE OF ILFRA THE UNDERSTANDING ONE WITH THAT HE TOOK SOME INK AND POURED IT IN HELFA'S HAND
HE WAS PLEASANT AND AGREEABLE TO EVERY ONE ESPECIALLY SO TO ME
I LOOKED AT HER FACE AND IT WAS DEATHLY PALE WHILE HER EYES TOLD ME SHE HAD PASSED SLEEPLESS NIGHTS
HE SAID SIMON
I RETAINED ONE FOR YOU KNOWING YOUR DISLIKE TO THE FAIR SEX
INSTINCTIVELY I FELT THAT I SHOULD HAVE MORE TO DO WITH THESE MEN THAN WITH THE REST OF THE COMPANY PRESENT
CHAPTER XIX THE SECOND CHRISTMAS EVE THE SKIES WERE CLEAR WHEN WE LEFT TURIN AND THE AIR PURE AND FREE
EVIDENTLY VOLTAIRE HAD BEEN CLAIMING THE FULFILMENT OF HER PROMISE FOR HE WAS EARNESTLY SPEAKING WHEN I ENTERED WHILE MISS FORREST PALE AS DEATH SAT BY AN ELDERLY LADY WHO I CONCLUDED TO BE HER AUNT
THIS AND THIS ONLY
I FORGOT I WAS NOT IN EGYPT
THERE WAS SOME WISDOM THEN SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE DEEP THINGS OF LIFE
ORDINARILY I SHOULD HAVE HAD TIME ENOUGH AND TO SPARE BUT EVERYTHING WAS DELAYED AND CONFUSED
MR HEROD VOLTAIRE--MR JUSTIN BLAKE SHE SAID
I DID NOT ENCOURAGE HIM TO SPEAK HOWEVER
HE REALLY COULD NOT SAY
NEVER MIND SUR
KAFFAR I SAID HAD I A HEART LIKE YOU EGYPTIANS YOU KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO
YES SIR WHO A GENTLEMAN FROM ENGLAND FROM ENGLAND
COME PROFESSOR ALLOW ME TO WRITE YOU A CHEQUE
THE TEACHING SEEMED SCIENTIFIC AND REASONABLE
ANYHOW I WILL NOT TRY TO DESCRIBE THEM FOR I SHOULD MISERABLY FAIL
BUT IF YOU GIVE IM A CHANCE HE'LL BEAT YER
I WAS NOT SO MUCH SURPRISED AT MY FREEDOM FROM THE INFLUENCE HE HAD EXERCISED OVER ME THE DAY AFTER I HAD PLACED MYSELF UNDER HIS POWER AND FOR A REASON THAT WAS MORE THAN PAINFUL TO ME
CONTINUE TO THINK SO
WE ARE WARM AND IMPULSIVE
ARRIVED AT THE STATION I SAW TOM TEMPLE WHO GAVE ME A HEARTY WELCOME AFTER WHICH HE SAID JUSTIN MY BOY DO YOU WANT TO BE INTRODUCED TO SOME LADIES AT PRESENT A THOUSAND TIMES NO I REPLIED
AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE PART WHERE JESUS CAME AND CAUSED THE EVIL SPIRIT TO COME OUT OF HIM MY HEART THROBBED WITH JOY
I REALIZED A STERN BEAUTY IN THE SCENE
SHE CAME CLOSER TO US SHE WENT ON WITH A SHUDDER AND THEN STOPPED LIFTING THE TERRIBLE KNIFE IN THE AIR
NO SOONER DID I ARRIVE IN LONDON HOWEVER AND TOOK POSSESSION OF MY EASY-CHAIR THAN I KNEW VOLTAIRE WANTED ME TO GO TO HIM AND I KNEW TOO THAT A MONTH BEFORE I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO YIELD TO THE POWER HE POSSESSED
AND SHE'S COME IN A SHROUD SAID THE SERVANT WHO HAD BEEN IN HYSTERICS AND THERE WAS SPOTS OF BLOOD UPON IT AND THAT MEANS THAT THE ONE WHO DIES WILL BE MURDERED
WAS THERE HOPE FOR ME
I KNEW I WAS THERE IN A YORKSHIRE ROAD RIDING ON A HIGH-BLOODED HORSE
IF I WERE WHOLLY IN HIS POWER HE COULD DO WITH ME AS HE WOULD AND NEED NOT TROUBLE ABOUT ANY PROMISES OF MINE
YOU SHOULD HAVE COME BEFORE
THAT I CANNOT GIVE YOU
I SAW THAT HE WAS NO ORDINARY CHARACTER AS SOON AS HE ENTERED AND WAS BY NO MEANS ONE WHO COULD BE EASILY IMPOSED UPON
I WAS LIKE ONE FASTENED TO THE GROUND
AS SOON AS CHURCH IS OVER WE COMMENCE OUR FUN
SHE WENT UP TO HER ROOM YER HONOUR AND I GOT IN A CONVENIENT PLACE FOR WATCHIN HER WHEN SHE COMES OUT
WHEN I ARRIVED ALL WAS QUIET
ARITHMETIC AND SOMETIMES A LITTLE MATHEMATICS READING WRITING FRENCH SOMETIMES GERMAN AND OF COURSE MUSIC AND DANCING
I SHOULD FIND HIM AT LAST
NO LIGHT SHINES IN THE SKY
SPEAK TO ME MY DAUGHTER AND TELL ME ALL SAID ABOU
BEFORE ME STRETCHED A DARK FUTURE
IT WAS GERTRUDE FORREST'S
WE TOOK A ROUNDABOUT ROAD TO TEMPLE HALL AND SO WERE LONGER TOGETHER AND AGAIN I WAS HAPPY
CERTAINLY I OUGHT TO HAVE FELT FLATTERED BY THEIR GREETING ESPECIALLY BY THAT OF MISS FORREST
BUT THERE WAS NO HOTEL NOR SIGN OF ONE IN THE STREET
YOU HAVE DARED TO DO THAT WHICH I TOLD YOU NOT
IT WAS KAFFAR
IF YOU CHOP ME UP SUR YOU'LL NOT FIND SIXPENNO'TH OF IMAGINATION IN MY CARCASE BUT I CALCALATE I'M PURTY EAVY WI JUDGMENT
I SEE NOW WELL WHAT'S THE NAME IT'S A NAME AS I NEVER SEE OR HEARD TELL ON BEFORE
A PURE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN HAD TRUSTED ME SO FULLY SO TRULY THAT HOPE DAWNED IN MY SKY AND EARTH WAS HEAVEN
AT THIS THE HOUSEKEEPER BECAME CONSCIOUS AND SAID IN A HOARSE WHISPER IS SHE GONE WHAT
I HAVE NOT AND IT IS GREATER THAN EVER
IT WAS NOW AUGUST AND I WAS NO NEARER FINDING HIM THAN WHEN I STARTED
JUSTIN BLAKE SHALL NOT LIE IN A PRISON CELL
IT SEEMED TOO PLAIN
HE'S A REAL STUDENT OF PSYCHOLOGY HE IS
QUITE SHE SAID
THE CASTLE WE VISITED WAS GRIM AND GREY ENOUGH
THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAD SOUGHT TO PICK A QUARREL WITH ME AND I FELT LIKE RESENTING IT
THIS MAY SEEM TO MANY EXTRAVAGANT PRAISE
I HAD TESTED MY OPPONENT BEFORE AND KNEW JUST HOW TO PLAY
I SHALL HAVE NO NEED TO TELL YOU MY ADDRESS AND HE LAUGHED A SAVAGE LAUGH
AH SAY I FELT THAT IF I ALLOWED THIS MAN TO THINK MY WELFARE DEPENDED ON HIS DOING MY WILL HE WOULD DEFY ME
HIS DIALECT WAS A MIXTURE OF THE COCKNEY AND A DOZEN OTHERS EQUALLY BAD UNTIL IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL FROM THAT SOURCE THE PART OF THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH HE HAILED
THEN I HOPE I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ESCORTING YOU I REPLIED
ONE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES HAD SURROUNDED HIS LIFE ANOTHER MINE AND OUR IMAGE AND SHAPE WERE ACCORDING TO THE FORCE OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
THERE WERE ONLY TWO HOTELS IN THE PLACE ONE OF WHICH WAS VERY SMALL
THEN WHEN THE EARTH IN ITS REVOLUTION SPELT OUT THAT HOUR WE ENTERED THE ROOM OF THE MAIDEN WHOSE SOUL HAD DEPARTED
EVERYTHING WAS ICE-BOUND
ARE THEY AT HOME DURING THE DAY NO WAS THE REPLY
HOW DID THEY KNOW THAT I GATHERED THAT MR BLAKE TOLD HER
I AM BECOME A PITIFUL COWARD YOU ARE GOING TO BE HAPPY SHE REPEATED
EVERYTHING WAS VERY QUIET
BUT I GATHERED THAT THEY HAD A DELIGHTFUL RIDE THAT MR BLAKE HAD MADE A DECLARATION OF LOVE TO GERTRUDE AND HER ANSWER I COULD NOT CATCH THAT
WITH THIS THOUGHT I GAVE MY HORSE THE REIN
SUDDENLY HOWEVER THERE WAS COMPARATIVE SILENCE
AS I STATED IT WAS A RAW COLD DAY
YOU ARE DECEIVING AN INNOCENT LADY
AS HE SAW THESE MARKS OF INTEREST A SMILE CREPT OVER HIS FACE
I SUPPOSE VOLTAIRE HAS TOLD EVERY ONE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF LAST NIGHT I SAID AT LENGTH
THEY ARE LIKE CLEVER DRAUGHT-PLAYERS
THEN I LOOKS AND SEES THAT THE DRAWER OF THE WARDROBE AIN'T QUITE SHUT SO I TAKES A STEP FORWARD AND PEEPS IN AND WHAT DID YOU SEE WHY I SEE THE TRAPPIN'S OF THAT ERE GHOST
BUT I CAN AT LEAST CONVINCE SCEPTICS
BUT IT IS HOPELESS NOW WHY YOU HAVE PROMISED TO MARRY ANOTHER MAN WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THIS BOTH OF US WERE VERY EXCITED
I ONLY DID WHAT HE TOLD ME AND HE HAS TREATED ME LIKE A DOG YES
WE SHALL ALL BE REALLY DISAPPOINTED IF YOU SAY NO SO WRITE AT ONCE AND TELL US YOU WILL COME ALSO WHEN WE MAY EXPECT YOU
SHE DID--FOR WELL-BEHAVED PEOPLE
HEROD VOLTAIRE CAME UP TO ME HOWEVER AND HISSED IN MY EAR DO YOU YIELD TO MY POWER NOW I ANSWERED ALMOST MECHANICALLY NO BUT YOU WILL HE WENT ON
YOU KNOW BEST ABOUT THAT IN SPITE OF THE PART YOU PLAY
I THINK YOUR STORY IS ALL IT APPEARS TO BE I REPLIED
IT MEANS I SAID THAT YOU ARE DECEIVED--MISTAKEN
I HOWEVER WAS SILENT
IT CAN ALWAYS BE DEPENDED ON
I ON THE OTHER HAND BELIEVE IT TO BE MORE REAL THAN THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE WE ARE NOT ALTOGETHER STRANGERS TO STORIES ABOUT SPIRITUALISM OR MESMERISM HERE SAID MISS FORREST BUT THE VOTARIES OF THESE SO-CALLED SCIENCES HAVE BEEN AND ARE SUCH MISERABLE SPECIMENS OF MANKIND THAT EDUCATED PEOPLE TREAT THEM WITH DERISION THERE WAS DECISION AND ENERGY IN HER VOICE
THIS WAS A LODGING-HOUSE WAS IT NOT
HE'S A-SHAVED OFF HIS WHISKERS AND HEV GOT A SORT O RED CAP LIKE A BAISIN ON HIS HEAD MY HEART GAVE A GREAT BOUND
BUT DOES MR BLAKE MEAN TO INSINUATE THAT MR KAFFAR AND MYSELF HAVE LEARNT SUCH A CODE AS THIS SAID VOLTAIRE AT LENGTH
YOU FEEL LIKE DEFYING ME DON'T YOU
IT WAS NOW WEDNESDAY MORNING AND I STARTED FROM PARIS WITH SIXTEEN HOURS BEFORE ME IN WHICH TO GET TO LONDON
THEN SHE SAID SLOWLY IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SPEAK TO YOU WITHOUT SHUDDERING
VOLTAIRE'S YOUR ENEMY NOT I YOU KNEW I WAS FOLLOWING YOU DID YOU I SAID
I RENOUNCE PLEASANT SOCIETY
OH NO JUSTIN REPLIED TOM
FIVE HOURS TO WAIT--FIVE HOURS
THE GHOST OF SOME MURDERED MAN OR WOMAN
ANYHOW I WHO HAD NEVER LOVED BEFORE LOVED NOW--LOVED PERHAPS FOOLISHLY
I PONDERED LONG OVER THE WORDS IF HE LEAVES DISGRACED PROVED TO BE A VILLAIN A DECEIVER A BLACKLEG OR WORSE THAN THAT WHILE I SHOW UP AS AN ANGEL OF LIGHT SURELY THAT MEANT A GREAT DEAL
THE IDEA OF TAKING A SPIRIT FROM A LIVING BODY AND SENDING IT AFTER SOME ONE THAT WAS DEAD IN ORDER THAT SOME SECRET MIGHT BE LEARNED MIGHT PASS FOR A HUGE JOKE
BUT JUSTIN CAN YOU REALLY GIVE NO EXPLANATION OF THESE THINGS
NO ONE COULD WANT HIM AS A FRIEND WHILE TO MAKE HIM AN ENEMY WOULD BE TERRIBLE I COULD NOT HELP SHUDDERING AS SHE SPOKE
THIS HOWEVER I CLEARLY SAW
HE HAD NOT BEEN GONE ABOVE HALF A MINUTE BEFORE HE CAME BOUNDING BACK TO MY ROOM
I WILL NOT WOUND YOUR TENDER NATURE
WHAT'S THAT
I KNOW NOTHING OF HIM
I HAVE FOUND HER WORDS TRUE IN MANY CASES AND I WAS SURE IN THE CASE OF VOLTAIRE MY FEELINGS TOLD ME WHAT ACTUALLY EXISTED
OF COURSE IT IS RATHER QUIET HERE BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO OUR BEST TO MAKE IT MORE LIVELY THAN USUAL
WE HAD AN OLD-FASHIONED ENGLISH DINNER AND THAT IS ABOUT ALL I CAN REMEMBER EXCEPT THAT THE TABLE LOOKED EXCEEDINGLY NICE
WOULD THE INQUIRIES BE SUCCESSFUL
THEN HE BURST OUT PASSIONATELY YES I WILL ANSWER YOU
BESIDES VOLTAIRE HAD TOLD ME IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIM
NOW DO YOU BELIEVE HE SAID
I TELL YOU MAN YOUR TRUMPED-UP STORY WOULD BE TORN TO PIECES IN FIVE MINUTES AND IN THE END YOU WOULD BE SAFELY LODGED DOWN AT DARTMOOR FOR FOURTEEN YEARS HE SAT SILENT A MINUTE AS IF IN DEEP THOUGHT
AGAIN IF HE WERE ALIVE WHERE WAS HE
IS THERE ANY MYSTERY CONNECTED WITH HIM I THINK THERE IS
I THOUGHT YOU WERE NOT COMING SHE SAID
I WENT SLOWLY DOWN TILL I CAME TO THE BOTTOM OF IT WHERE A NARROW ROAD BRANCHED OFF LEADING TO A KIND OF OBSERVATORY
I FELT THAT IT WAS EVER IN HIS MIND THAT I SHOULD NOT MAKE ANY EFFORTS AND I HAD TO OBEY
IF I DARED
I AM DAZED--BEWILDERED BUT THAT IS KAFFAR'S KNIFE
I HAD DONE ALL THAT I COULD DO MYSELF
WHERE AM I CRIED SIMON
MUCH AS I LOVED HER I WAS TOO PROUD TO ASK A REASON FOR THIS AND SO ALTHOUGH WE WERE SO FRIENDLY ON CHRISTMAS DAY WE WERE EXCEEDINGLY COLD AND DISTANT WHEN NEW YEAR'S EVE CAME
DO YOU SEE KAFFAR THE EGYPTIAN HE LOOKED AROUND AS IF IN DOUBT
I DON'T FEEL UP TO IT
I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US I REELED UNDER THIS TERRIBLE SHOCK
ALTOGETHER THE FACE WAS REPULSIVE
THE EGYPTIANS HAVE LOST MUCH OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANCIENTS ESPECIALLY IN THE ART OF EMBALMING
YOU DON'T THINK THAT ERE WACCINATIN SUMNAMBLIFYIN WILLAIN EV GOT THE THING IN AND I DIDN'T SPEAK BUT LOOKED KEENLY AT HIM
I WAS NOT SORRY HOWEVER FOR I WAS THUS ENABLED TO ENJOY MORE OF MISS FORREST'S SOCIETY
EVIDENTLY HIS IMPRESSION OF ME WAS NOT FAVOURABLE FOR A CYNICAL SMILE CURLED HIS LIPS AND HIS EYES GLEAMED WITH A STEELY GLITTER
WHY I MUST HAVE SOME CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT LAST NIGHT
HE SUFFERED BECAUSE THE GLORIOUS KNOWLEDGE HE LONGED FOR WAS RUDELY SNATCHED FROM HIM THOU MAN OF THE WEST WHO BEAREST THE NAME OF A JEWISH KING HE SAID TO ME THIS IS A HEAVY BLOW NOT TOO HEAVY FOR YOU ABOU I SAID
SHE IS STILL TRYING TO DO THE SAME
WHY WHAT WILL YOU DO SHE CRIED
AND YET I TREMBLED LEST HE SHOULD MENTION ANOTHER NAME
COULD IT BE THAT I HAD COME ALL THESE WEARY MILES AGAIN ONLY FOR A BITTER AND TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT
EVERY DAY VICE TRIUMPHED EVERY DAY VIRTUE SUFFERED
WHILE YOU AH MR BLAKE HAVE MERCY HE WHINED
NO MR KAFFAR YOU MUST NOT ESCAPE I SAID LEADING HIM BACK TO HIS CHAIR
I READ THE OTHER LETTERS
THEN HE TURNED TO ME
MAN YOU ARE MAD NOT SO MAD I SAYS SEEIN AS OW I SEE YOU CARRY THAT ERE GHOST'S WARDROBE AND PUT IT IN MR BLAKE'S ROOM LAST NIGHT SHE WENT OFF WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD YER HONOUR AND THE NEXT THING I HEARD BOUT HER WAS THAT SHE'D GONE TO LONDON AND WHY DID YOU NOT TELL MR TEMPLE WELL MR BLAKE HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING BOUT HER EVENIN RAMBLES WI THAT ERE HINFIDEL WILLAIN AND WASN'T ACQUAINTED WI THE THINGS THAT YOU AND ME HEV TALKED ABOUT
HIS FACE BECAME ASHY PALE
THIS BOOK IS ONE OF REMARKABLE POWER THE PAPER WENT ON TO SAY AND WILL APPEAL TO THE HIGHEST CLASS OF MINDS
THE HOUSES WERE WHITE THE STREETS WERE WHITE
SIMON SAID TOM A SECOND AFTER WHAT COLOUR ARE THE CHESTNUT MARE'S EYES SIMON HEAVED HIMSELF STRUGGLED LOOKED VACANT AND SAID DREAMILY THEY'RE LOIKE WOMEN AND--WACCINATION YOU--YOU BUT A FILM CAME OVER HIS EYES AND HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS
MEANWHILE ALL THIS TIME HE KEPT LOOKING AT ME AND HIS WORDS WERE UTTERED WITH A NERVOUS FORCE AND INTENSITY THAT WAS TERRIBLE
THEY TOO SEEMED TO BELIEVE IN THE REALITY OF THE APPARITION
WE WASTED NO TIME AFTER BREAKFAST BEFORE SETTING OUT--I WITH BEATING HEART SIMON STILL CALM AND COLLECTED LOOKING WITH CRITICAL EYES ON THE SKETCH HE HAD DRAWN IN HIS MESMERIC SLEEP
CERTAINLY I AM SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE INFLUENCE OF LADIES"--AND HE SMILED THEREBY SHOWING HIS WHITE SHINING TEETH--"BUT I AM A GREAT ADMIRER OF HONEST MEN WHOEVER THEY MAY BE OR WHATEVER BE THEIR OPINION
I AM PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT ABOUT THE MATTER I REPLIED
HE'S GOT A HINKLIN AS HOW WE'RE TRYIN TO MATCH EM AND RECKONS AS HOW I'M YER FRIEND
NEED I SAY THAT MY MORNING WAS TRULY ENJOYABLE
HE STOOD AND LOOKED AT HER FOR A MINUTE AS IF IN DOUBT WHAT TO DO
I DON'T KNOW SHE REPLIES
COULD HE TELL ME OF ANY BOARDING OR LODGING ESTABLISHMENT IN THE STREET
SAYS HE WHEN HE'D DONE SIMON YOU'LL NEVER HAVE SMALL-POX NOW THINK NOT SAYS I
HE IS AN EGYPTIAN AND EASILY DISTINGUISHED
WIN HER MAN AND OUR FORTUNES ARE MADE THIS WAS SAID QUICKLY AND WITH ALL THE FERVOUR OF AN EASTERN
MISS FORREST AVOIDED EVER MEETING ME ALONE NEVER SPOKE TO ME SAVE IN MONOSYLLABLES AND WAS COLD AND HAUGHTY TO ME AT ALL TIMES
ALTHOUGH I AM NOW ENTIRELY FREE FROM ANY SUCH INFLUENCES I CANNOT HELP FEARFULLY WONDERING AT THE AWFUL POWER ONE BEING CAN EXERT OVER ANOTHER
CERTAINLY THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE AFFAIR AND MY OLD FRIEND ABOU AL PHADRE WOULD HAVE SMILED AT ITS LITTLENESS
DID HE REMEMBER SUCH A PASSENGER AS I DESCRIBED
BY A TREMENDOUS EFFORT OF WILL I WAS FREE
YES AND YOU ARE A LIAR A COWARD A VILLAIN
WERE I TO TRY I COULD GIVE NO ADEQUATE IDEA OF MY HOPES AND FEARS MY PRAYERS AND STRUGGLES
WAS HE ALIVE
AND THE NEXT THING I HEARS WUS THAT THE COACHMAN WUR AT THE WILLAGE ALEHOUSE READIN MY LETTER
WE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT LENGTH HOWEVER AND THEN I HASTENED FROM HER SIDE TO LIFT HER FROM THE SADDLE
WE WERE MORE THAN BROTHERS
MY WAY OF EXPRESSING MY THOUGHTS IS PERHAPS DISTASTEFUL TO YOU
AND THEN WITH ALL POSSIBLE HASTE I MADE MY WAY HOME AND THROWING MYSELF IN A CHAIR SAT DOWN TO READ IT
IT CAUSED NO SENSATION AT ALL
THE FIRST HAD A PECULIAR NAME
DID SHE I WONDERED CARE ANYTHING FOR ME
AT LEAST SO IT SEEMED TO ME
TOM ATTRIBUTES ALL HIS HAPPINESS TO THE GHOST
LET ME CALL YOU BY YOUR NAME AND I WILL WIPE THE BLOOD FROM THIS KNIFE I WILL DESTROY EVERY EVIDENCE OF THE DARK DEED
I WAS SILENT
IT IS OWIN TO THE EXPERIMENTIN O A WACCINATIN DOCTOR WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME MAN SHE SAID
I DETERMINED I WOULD MEET STRATAGEM WITH STRATAGEM
THE HAND WAS RED I GAVE A SHRIEK AND FOR A TIME REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE
AFTER THIS MRS WALTERS INSISTED THAT WE MUST HAVE REFRESHMENTS AND BUSTLED AWAY TO ORDER IT WHILE A SERVANT CONDUCTED SIMON AND KAFFAR TO A ROOM WHERE FOOD WAS TO BE OBTAINED
INSTANTLY EVERYTHING FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND IN RELATION TO OUR TERRIBLE MEETING OF THE NIGHT BEFORE
BESIDES I SEEK TO IMPOSE NONE OF MY STORIES ON ANY ONE
I KNOW IT WAS AN EVIDENCE OF MY COWARDICE BUT I COULD NOT WITHSTAND THEIR LAUGHTER
WELL CONTINUED MISS GRAY THIS IS THE PROPER PLACE TO BE BEWITCHED
CERTAINLY EVERYTHING WAS STRANGE
WHEN IT WAS IN HIS SON'S HANDS HE LOOKED AT ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYES UNTIL WHILE I WAS IN POSSESSION OF ALL MY SENSES I SEEMED TO LIVE A CHARMED LIFE
THAT WOULD NEVER DO
FROM THAT MOMENT I AM SURE HE REGARDED ME AS HIS RIVAL AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE SOUGHT TO MEASURE HIS STRENGTH WITH MINE
I AM UP IN EGYPT AGAIN IT WAS LITTLE WE ATE SAID VOLTAIRE DURING THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS
AGAIN I REALIZED MY EXISTENCE IN A VAGUE SHADOWY WAY
I HAVE DECIDED TO HOLD YOU AS THE SLAVE TO MY WILL UNTIL THE DAY MISS GERTRUDE FORREST BECOMES MRS HEROD VOLTAIRE AND THEN TO SET YOU FREE
EVERY HOUR MAY BE PRECIOUS
CHRISTMAS MORNING IV
DO YOU SEE KAFFAR THE EGYPTIAN REPEATED HE
AH
AH
AH
WE WERE SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR
WHAT DO YOU WISH ME TO TELL YOU ABOUT HE SAID IN ANSWER TO REPEATED REQUESTS FOR HIM TO BEGIN FROM SEVERAL YOUNG LADIES
WE WERE EARLY AT THE PROFESSOR'S THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND FOUND HIM WAITING AND ALMOST AS ANXIOUS AS WE WERE
BUT NEVER MIND
I LIVED WI A DOCTOR ONCE AND SAYS HE TO ME SIMON I WANT TO SPERIMENT ON YE SAYS HE
WHILE HIS MOTHER WHO STILL LIVES THE SAME KIND OF LIFE AS OF YORE SUPPLIES HIM WITH MONEY
THE DARKNESS HAD ROLLED AWAY AND THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN SHONE UPON US
YOU DID KILL KAFFAR AND HE LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF YONDER GHOSTLY POOL
SUPPOSING I SUCCEEDED WAS I ANY MORE FIT TO BE HER HUSBAND THAN HE
I HAD ONLY A DIM HAZY IDEA OF WHAT I WAS DOING EXCEPT THAT I SOUGHT TO WREST FROM HIS HAND A KNIFE
BY THIS TIME VOLTAIRE WAS READY WITH HIS PERFORMANCE
AND I TRIED I RESISTED I STRUGGLED
THE POWER HE POSSESSED WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND I HAD TO STRUGGLE TO THE UTMOST TO REMAIN UNCONQUERED
WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME HERE I ASKED SAVAGELY
BUT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE GOOD NEWS
SEVERAL SPOKE OF HIS GOING AWAY AS BEING A GOOD RIDDANCE AND DECLARED HIM TO BE UNFIT FOR RESPECTABLE SOCIETY
HE LOOKED LIKE A JUDAS WHO BETRAYED HIS MASTER QUIETLY PLEASE I REPLIED
BUT I SHOULD DO AWAY WITH MUCH OF THE NONSENSE OF ORDINARY ENGLISH EDUCATION AND DEAL WITH THE MORE OCCULT SCIENCES PARDON ME BUT I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE MY MEANING PLAIN
FAR REMOVED FROM THE GIDDY SOCIETY GIRL SHE WAS YET FULL OF MIRTH AND PLEASANTNESS
I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT OF DISOBEYING HIM
I OPENED THE DOOR NOISELESSLY AND WENT INTO THE ROOM AND SAID DISTINCTLY GOOD EVENING MR KAFFAR HE LOOKED UP AND SAW ME
MY HOPES HAD RISEN HIGH BUT THEY WERE BY THIS ANSWER DASHED TO THE GROUND
YES SIR REPLIED THE CLERK
HAD I IN MY MESMERIC CONDITION YIELDED TO HIS WILL IN SUCH A DEGREE AS TO KILL THE WILY EGYPTIAN AND HURL HIM IN THE POND
THERE IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT THE APPARITION SEEMED VERY UNREAL
MOSTLY IT WAS COLD AND WEARISOME ENOUGH
IT'S IN HIS POCKET AND I CAN'T SEE THROUGH THE CLOTH I CAN'T AND WHAT'S HE DOING NOW WHY HE'S IN FOR MAKIN HISSELF COMFORTABLE HE IS
I HAVE SPENT YEARS OF MY LIFE IN FINDING OUT THE SECRETS OF LIFE
I THINK IT FAIR TO EVERY GUEST THAT HE SHOULD SPEAK OUT I WOULD NOT LIKE TO SAY HE SAID INSULTINGLY
I WILL TELL YOU NOW WHAT ALL THE WORLD MUST KNOW TO-MORROW
WELL I HOPE I AM TO YOU FOR I HAVE BEEN REALLY LONGING FOR YOU TO COME AND I WANT YOU TO HAVE A JOLLY TIME I'M SURE I SHALL I REPLIED
THAT MAN WHO MESMERIZED YOU IS VERY CLEVER SAID THE PROFESSOR QUIETLY WHEN I HAD FINISHED
SOMEHOW SOME WAY I WILL THWART YOU I CRIED
SHE WAS VERY POLITE HOWEVER AND QUICKLY CALLED DOWN THE PROPRIETOR OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
THEY TOOK BUT LITTLE NOTICE OF US HOWEVER AND FOR MY OWN PART I FELT RELIEVED WHEN THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT
AT LENGTH IT CAME AND I READ AS FOLLOWS
WE SWEPT THROUGH MONT CENIS TUNNEL AND THEN WITH A CRY OF GLADNESS WE ENTERED THE SUNNY LAND OF ITALY
THE NILE WAS EXCEEDINGLY LOW AND WATER WAS COMPARATIVELY SCARCE
DID I DO ANYTHING VERY FOOLISH I ASKED RECOLLECTING THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING
I BELIEVE SHE CONTINUED AFTER A PAUSE THAT THE THOUGHT-READING AND MESMERISM WERE SOMEHOW DESIGNED TO INJURE YOU
WE KNEW NOT WHERE TO GO WHEN MR TEMPLE THOUGHT HE HEARD VOICES AWAY IN THE DISTANCE
INSTEAD OF WHICH IT WAS CONQUERING EVERY DAY
WE WERE TO DINE AT SEVEN THAT DAY AND AS I DID NOT USUALLY MAKE AN ELABORATE TOILETTE I KNEW I HAD PLENTY OF TIME
I WALKED RAPIDLY FOR THE MORNING WAS COLD
I STOOD UP AGAIN AND SMILED
ARE YOU QUITE JUSTIFIED IN SAYING THAT I REPLIED SCARCELY KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO SAY
OTHERWISE SOME ONE MAY BE WRONGLY ACCUSED DO NOT ASK ME SAID KAFFAR
I HAVE DONE VERY WRONG
TRY
TRY
THERE HE CRIED AND THEN HE STRUCK ME IN THE FACE WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH
I HAD SHOWN MY HAND
YOU ARE A WONDERFUL MAN
SO SURPRISED WAS HE
NEVERTHELESS I FELT SURE THAT IF I WAS TO OBTAIN THE MASTERY OVER SUCH A MAN IT WOULD BE LITTLE SHORT OF A MIRACLE
SHE HAS ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER IT
SO THAT IS NOT THE REASON
I TOLD MY LITTLE GIRL JUST NOW--FOR SHE IS MINE NOW--THAT SHE WANTED A STRONG MAN TO PROTECT SUCH A WEAK LITTLE DARLING AND SHE SHE SAID THAT SHE KNEW OF NO ONE WHOM SHE LIKED THAT CARED ENOUGH FOR HER TO PROTECT HER
I DID NOT WAIT THERE LONG
THERE IS NO NECESSITY THAT I SHOULD WRITE OF WHAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE REMAINDER OF CHRISTMAS EVE
AND SO I KEP ON WATCHIN AND SCUSE ME YER HONOUR BUT I CAN GUESS AS OW THINGS BE AND I'M FEAR'D AS OW THIS WACCINATION DODGE IS A TRICK O THIS ERE WILLAIN EXPLAIN YOURSELF SIMON WELL SIR I KNOWS AS OW YOU'VE ONLY BIN YER ONE DAY BUT I COULD SEE IN A MINIT AS OW YOU WAS A SMITTEN WITH A CERTAIN YOUNG LADY AND I CAN SEE TOO AS OW THAT WHITE-EYED WILLAIN IS SMITTEN IN THE SAME QUARTER AND HE SEES OW THINGS BE AND HE MEANS BUSINESS IT WAS BY NO MEANS PLEASANT TO HEAR MY AFFAIRS TALKED OF IN THIS WAY AND IT WAS A MARVEL TO ME HOW SIMON COULD HAVE LEARNT SO MUCH BUT I HAVE FOUND THAT A CERTAIN CLASS OF ENGLISH SERVANT SEEMS TO FIND OUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE HOUSE WITH WHICH THEY ARE CONNECTED AND I AM AFRAID I WAS VERY CARELESS AS TO WHO SAW THE STATE OF MY FEELINGS
I WILL MAKE YOU AN OBJECT OF HATRED HIS LIGHT EYES GLEAMED WITH AN UNEARTHLY GLARE
I MYSELF AM GOING TO LONDON TO-DAY AND MOST LIKELY SHALL REMAIN THERE FOR A WHILE
I WOULD I COULD BE MERCIFUL BUT IT MUST NOT BE
BUT TELL ME WHO IS THIS SOME ONE TO WHOM YOU OR HE HAS RELATED LAST NIGHT'S AFFAIR AND WHY WAS IT DONE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I OUGHT TO TELL OR NO BUT YOU ARE AN OLD FRIEND AND I CANNOT REFUSE
IN DECEMBER I SHALL TAKE HER TO MY BREAST BUT SUPPOSING I SAID THAT I FIND KAFFAR
HAVE MERCY YES YES HE SAID HIS VOICE HUSKY WITH PASSION
THE DARK CLOUDS WHICH SWEPT ACROSS THE SKY HID THE PALE RAYS OF THE MOON AND CLOTHED IN BLACK AS I WAS IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SEE ME AMONGST THE DARK TALL TREES
I WILL PROVE TO YOU THAT I HAVE NOT SPOKEN BOASTINGLY
OUR FACES BE A BIT PITTY BUT KISSES AIN'T NONE THE LESS SWEET FOR THAT AND WHEN IS IT TO COME OFF SIMON I'M GOIN TO THE REGISTRAR'S NOW YER HONOUR SO THREE WEEKS TO-MORROW I SHALL BE TOOK IN AND DONE FOR AND ALL THREW WACCINATION THE END END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF WEAPONS OF MYSTERY BY JOSEPH HOCKING
THE EGYPTIAN
EVIDENTLY HE WANTED THE YOUNG LADY TO BELIEVE IN YOUR GUILT AND THUS GIVE HIM GREATER CHANCE OF SUCCESS
YOU COULD CHARM EVEN AN ANGEL WELL YOU'LL DO YOUR BEST FOR ME WON'T YOU SAYS HE
YOU HAVE GUESSED MY SECRET
BUT DON'T YOU REMAIN
IN A FEW YEARS TIME WE SHALL SEE THE LIKE PERFORMED ON THE SANDS AT OUR FASHIONABLE WATERING-PLACES I AM GLAD SAID KAFFAR THAT THE EDUCATION OF YOUR COUNTRY HAS SO FAR ADVANCED I WENT ON TALKING NOT REALIZING THAT I WAS ALL THE TIME FORGING A CHAIN THAT SHOULD HOLD ME IN CRUEL BONDAGE
I WOULD PROMISE NOTHING UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS PERHAPS I HAD BETTER TELL MY STORY I SAID
LET IT BE UNDERSTOOD BEFORE WE GO FURTHER THAT I WAS A BACHELOR LIVING IN LODGINGS
OFTEN THE SONS OF EGYPT MOAN OVER THAT DEPARTED WISDOM
THAT EGYPTIAN IS A WATCHER HE SAID GRIMLY AND I DON'T LIKE EITHER OF EM WHAT'S THE MATTER SIMON WHY THIS YER MORNING I WUR EXCHANGIN A FEW PLEASANT REMARKS WITH ONE OF THE MAID-SERVANTS WHEN I HEARS THE EGYPTIAN SAY IT'S GWINE BEAUTIFUL HOW SAYS T'OTHER
IT HAD GONE ABROAD THAT I HAD GONE OUT TO FIND KAFFAR BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO
MY POLICY IS TO BE QUIET
CURSE YOU HE CRIED YOU DEFY ME EH
BUT STILL SINCE YOU PLACE IT IN THAT LIGHT I SHOULD LIKE TO BE CONVINCED BY THIS TIME THE INTEREST MANIFESTED IN THE MATTER WAS GREAT
AN EGYPTIAN VILLAGE NOT FAR REMOVED FROM SOME OF THE GREAT TEMPLES OF THE DEAD PAST
PRIDE AND VEXATION SEEMED TO OVERCOME HER OTHER FEELINGS AND SO SILENTLY WE RODE ON TOGETHER UNTIL WE REJOINED OUR COMPANIONS
I BELIEVE SHE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN DO A MEAN THING AND YET I SAID WEARILY I AM ALMOST CERTAIN I DID NOT KILL KAFFAR
MISS FORREST I SAID DO NOT MOCK ME
I WOULD SACRIFICE FATHER AND MOTHER FOR YOU I GAVE A GREAT START
THEY SEEMED QUARRELLIN LIKE WHEN I COME UP FOR SHE WUR SAYIN TIS NO USE SHE NEVER WILL NONSENSE SAYS HE
NO WORDS CAN EXPRESS WHAT I FELT AS THE MAN UNTHINKINGLY UTTERED KAFFAR'S NAME
I MUST NOT SHE SAID AND YOU MUST KEEP ME FROM DANGER I MISS FORREST
SHOULD HE TAKE ME
YOU WILL SEE HE SAID THAT HERE WE HAVE NO CHANCE FOR STAGE TRICKS
WHERE'VE I BEEN I CAN'T TELL SAID THE PROFESSOR
MISS FORREST MISS EDITH GRAY JUSTIN BLAKE AND--MYSELF WAS THE REPLY
A FLASH OF LIGHT
IN FIVE MINUTES YOU WILL BE SAFE IN A POLICEMAN'S CHARGE IF I WERE YOU I WOULD TRY AND LEARN THE ENGLISHMAN'S LAWS BEFORE YOU APPEAL TO THEM
I WENT TO HER ROOM LAST NIGHT AND I BEGAN TO TELL HER MORE ABOUT HIM AND COMPARE HIM WITH YOU WELL SAYS HE
I CANNOT BE SILENT WHEN THAT WHICH IS DEARER TO ME THAN LIFE ITSELF IS SUBMITTED TO THE COOL TEST OF BIGOTED IGNORANCE
I FOUND MISS FORREST STILL IN THE LIBRARY TOGETHER WITH TOM TEMPLE AND EDITH GRAY
BUT THAT ERE EMILY THE OUSEMAID EV BIN WACCINATED AND SHE EV HAD SMALL-POX TOO
I FORGOT I WAS IN ENGLAND WHERE MEN ARE THE SLAVES OF THE LADIES
DID MISS GERTRUDE FORREST LIVE THERE
WE HAD BEEN KEPT ASUNDER BY A CRUEL HAND AND HAD BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER AGAIN BY LONG AND BITTER STRUGGLES STRUGGLES WHICH WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND THE LOVE IN OUR HEARTS
THIS IS A PLEASANT SURPRISE I SAID AFTER RESPONDING TO HER GREETING
BUT FROM BEHIND ONE OF THE TREES STEPPED OUT A MAN AND THE MAN WAS--HEROD VOLTAIRE
WE ARE THOUGHT BY FOREIGNERS TO BE VERY CONSERVATIVE AND PERHAPS THERE MAY BE TRUTH IN IT
I CANNOT SAY I FELT EITHER ELATED OR DEPRESSED BY THIS ANSWER
I HAVE HEARD IT SAID THAT SUCH CHARACTERS FALL IN LOVE QUICKLY OR NOT AT ALL
ADDED TO THIS SHE WAS TALL AND BONY AND WOULD HAVE PASSED ANYWHERE FOR ONE OF THE WITCHES OF OLDEN TIME
I STOPPED AGAIN FOR AN INSTANT
THINK YOU I HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF THAT HE SAID
HIS LIMBS GREW STIFF AND IN A FEW SECONDS HE LAY LIFELESS BY US
CHAPTER XI DARK DREAMS AND NIGHT SHADOWS I SUPPOSE I MUST HAVE GONE ON BLINDLY FOR SOME TIME FOR WHEN I AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS I STOOD BESIDE A RIVER WHILE TALL TREES WAVED THEIR LEAFLESS BRANCHES OVERHEAD
SOMETHING IMPORTANT MIGHT BE THE RESULT OF SUCH A CONVERSATION
THEY'RE GONE TO DREARWATER POND YER HONOUR
ARRIVED IN ALEXANDRIA I AGAIN SET INQUIRIES ON FOOT BUT WITH FAR LESS CHANCE OF SUCCESS
PARDON ME SAID KAFFAR EXCITEDLY
FOR A MINUTE I WAS CHAINED TO THE SEAT
HERE I FOUND THAT INQUIRIES COULD EASILY BE MADE
AFTER WHICH HE HAD MADE CONSIDERABLE INROADS INTO A COLD CHICKEN WITH PERCHANCE HALF A POUND OF COLD HAM TO KEEP IT COMPANY
THERE WAS NO GOD
I'LL GET OUT I WAS TOO LATE
AND INSTANTLY WE WERE LOOKING INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES I FEELING A STRANGE KIND OF SHIVER PASS THROUGH ME
THE SOUL HAS FLOWN BUT WHEN THE THREE TIMES SEVEN YEARS IS COMPLETE YOU CAN CALL HER BACK AND LEARN HER WISDOM I CAN CALL HER BACK BUT THE SECRET--AH I KNOW IT NOT HE SAID BY THIS TIME THERE WAS A DEADLY SILENCE IN THE ROOM
I SHOULD POLITELY IGNORE HIM I WATCHED HER FACE AS SHE SPOKE
THAT HE DEFIES YOUR POWER
I DETERMINED TO LISTEN
THE SPIRITS OF THE SO-CALLED DEAD ARE LIVING FORCES ALL AROUND US WHO CAN TELL THEIR CONDITION TO THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE SECRETS OF SPIRITUALISM
I POSSESSED FREEDOM
WHAT I HAD READ WAS SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE ME TO BUY THE BOOK
AND AGAIN I FELT HAPPY
BUT--BUT I PRAY THAT GOD MAY FORGIVE YOU AS I DO THEN I WILL LEAVE YOU HE SAID WITH A TERRIBLE LOOK AT ME
SURELY I COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN
LARGE GREY LIZARDS CRAWLED IN AND OUT AMONG THE CREVICES OF THE ROCKS AND SEEMED TO LAUGH AS THEY SPORTED AMIDST WHAT WAS ONCE THE EXPRESSION OF A GREAT RELIGIOUS SYSTEM BUT WHICH WAS NOW TERRIBLE IN ITS WEIRD DESOLATION
EH LAD"--TURNING TO ME--"IF YE COOM ACROSS SOME ONE AS YE DOESNA LIKE HAE AS LEETLE TO DO WI EM AS YE CAN I AM INCLINED TO THINK THERE IS TRUTH IN THIS JUDGMENT OF THE OLD SCOTCH LADY
I SHALL EXPECT YOU EARLY TO-MORROW NO SOONER WERE WE IN THE STREET THAN SIMON BEGAN TO ASK ME WHAT HE HAD TOLD ME FOR I FOUND THAT HE WAS ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE THINGS HE HAD SAID
HE CALLED THEM ALL HOWAJJA AND REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE
I HAD NOT MADE VERY GREAT INROADS INTO THE OMELETTE MY LANDLADY HAD PREPARED FOR ME WHEN I HEARD THE POSTMAN'S KNOCK AND SOON AFTER A SERVANT ENTERED WITH A LETTER
BUT YOU'LL GO BACK TO THE DRAWING-ROOM NO
THOSE WHO LOVE THE HIGHER POWERS HOWEVER AND CAN RESPECT THE DIVINE POWER OF KNOWLEDGE WOULD HAVE KNELT AT ABOU'S FEET
AH YOU DO NOT KNOW SURELY I HAD FOUND OUT THE MAN'S NATURE
SPIRIT OF ILFRA SAID ABOU ARE YOU HERE NO VOICE SPOKE THAT I COULD HEAR AND YET I REALIZED THAT ABOU HAD RECEIVED HIS ANSWER
SURELY I A MAN OF THIRTY OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER
IT WAS THE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WAS POSSESSED WITH A DEVIL WHICH THE DISCIPLES COULD NOT CAST OUT
THE NEXT MORNING I BADE GOOD-BYE TO MY FRIENDS AND STARTED FOR THE STATION
I SAW AGAIN THE LARGE RED HAND ON THE WATER'S SURFACE
A WEIGHT SEEMED TO REST UPON ME MY FREE AGENCY WAS GONE
STILL PREACHERS TALKED OF A LOVING GOD OF THE GOOD BEING STRONGER THAN THE EVIL
MISS FORREST MUST BE YOURS AND THAT FOR SEVERAL REASONS
I MUST PRODUCE HIM NOTHING ELSE WOULD SUFFICE
I THOUGHT WHEN I WUR DONE THE LAST TIME IT SHOULD BE THE LAST TIME
YOU SPEAK IN WORDS THAT CONVEY NO MEANING TO MY MIND
I GRIEVE FOR YOU LADY
ALL SEEMED AFRAID TO UTTER A SOUND EXCEPT KAFFAR
YOU CANNOT THINK WHAT YOUR WORDS MEAN TO ME OR YOU WOULD NOT SPEAK THEM WILL YOU NOT FOR MY SAKE IF NOT FOR YOUR OWN EXERT YOURSELF
MY NEW-FOUND STRENGTH NOT ONLY BROUGHT ME FREEDOM FROM MY ENEMY NOT ONLY ENABLED ME TO ACCOMPLISH MY PURPOSE BUT GAVE ME FULLER AND RICHER LIFE
THE SHROUD KNIFE AND ALL THE REST ON'T WELL SIMON WELL SUR I TAKES IT TO MY SHANTY AND PUTS IT IN MY OWN BOX TO SHOW YOU AT A CONVENIENT SEASON AS MOSES SAID IS THAT ALL NOT QUITE
IT WOULD NOW BE A TRIAL OF SKILL BETWEEN US
PERHAPS HE BELIEVES MY STORY IS MADE ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE SCARCELY I REPLIED
I WISH I COULD A HAD A CONFABULATION WITH YER AFORE THIS PERFORMANCE COME OFF
HE LAUGHED SCORNFULLY
DO MR VOLTAIRE
YES YOU LAUGH HE SAID
I THEREFORE CLOSED WITH THIS OFFER AND SHORTLY AFTER DROVE AWAY
THE LITTLE MAN LOOKED TO ME FOR EXPLANATION
THEN HE GAVE A SHRUG AS IF HE WAS DISGUSTED WITH HIMSELF WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY AN EXPRESSION OF GRIM DETERMINATION
GIVE IM A WIDE BERTH YER HONOUR AND DOAN'T HEV NOTHIN TO DO WI IM OH I REPLIED HE CAN'T HURT ME DON'T KNOW YER HONOUR
THE TRAIN WAS CROWDED AND I WAS GLAD TO GET IN AT ALL UNMINDFUL OF COMFORT
TOM HURRIED TO MISS GRAY AND TOOK HER BY THE HAND WHILE I NOTHING LOTH SPOKE TO MISS FORREST
THIS APPEARED TO ASSURE THE HOUSEKEEPER WHO GOT UP AND TRIED TO COLLECT HER THOUGHTS
FROM THAT TIME I COULD CATCH NOTHING OF WHAT WAS SAID ALTHOUGH THEY CONVERSED FOR FIVE MINUTES AT LEAST
I WENT TO MOSQUES TO TEMPLES TO BAZAARS--IN VAIN
I PREFER TO BE A SPECTATOR I COULD NO LONGER MISTAKE THE HATE THAT FLASHED FROM HIS EYES
THE FORMER WAS JUST THE KIND OF LADY I HAD PICTURED HER WHILE THE DAUGHTERS GAVE PROMISE OF FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THEIR KIND-HEARTED MOTHER
THE INSINUATION WAS SO FAR FROM TRUE THAT FOR THE MOMENT I WAS TOO SURPRISED TO SPEAK
SO I DETERMINED TO REMAIN IN YORKSHIRE UNTIL SHE RETURNED TO LONDON AND EVEN THEN I HOPED TO BE ABLE TO SHIELD HER FROM THE DESIGNS WHICH I WAS SURE VOLTAIRE STILL HAD
I WANTED TO TELL OF MY VICTORY IN PERSON AND THUS IF NEEDS BE DESTROY VOLTAIRE'S LAST HOPE
THE OFFICIALS HERE WOULD NOT BE SO LIKELY TO NOTICE ANY PARTICULAR PASSENGER
THAT THE MAN WHOM YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD ENTRAPPED BY A JUGGLER'S TRICK TO BE YOUR TOOL AND DUPE IS AS FREE AS YOU ARE
INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE LADIES INTO THE HOUSE I FOLLOWED THE HORSES TO THE STABLES
GERTRUDE AND I LIVE UNDER BRIGHTER SKIES THAN WE SHOULD DO HAD I NOT BEEN LED THROUGH SO TERRIBLE AN EXPERIENCE
BUT HELFA WAS LIKE UNTO THAT WHICH HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
SUPPOSING HE HAD GONE TO EGYPT HOW COULD I FIND HIM
I THINK SOMEHOW THEY ARE ACQUAINTED WITH FORCES UNKNOWN TO US AND WILL USE THEM FOR EVIL YES I BELIEVE ALL THAT I SAID
THE COTTAGERS SAT OUTSIDE THEIR DOORS SINGING IN THE SUN
THERE WAS VILLAINY TO BE UNMASKED THERE WAS A TRUE INNOCENT GIRL TO BE SAVED WHILE MY REPUTATION HAPPINESS AND PERHAPS LIFE WERE IN DANGER
AND STILL I WAS BOUND IN CHAINS
STILL I WAS HELD BY A MYSTERIOUS OCCULT POWER
MAN I HOLD YOUR LIFE IN THE HOLLOW OF MY HAND
HIS COMMAND WAS UPON ME
I HAD RETURNED TO MY NORMAL CONDITION AGAIN AND HAD TOLD NOTHING
BUT I MUST KNOW
ILFRA IS THERE
I DARE SAY I SAID
ONE DETECTIVE FANCIED HE HAD DETECTED HIM IN CONSTANTINOPLE
WEIGHTS SEEMED TO HANG ON MY LIMBS AND MY WHOLE BEING WAS IN A KIND OF TORPOR
THE LADIES ESPECIALLY EVIDENTLY FASCINATED BY THE WITCHERY OF THIS MAN'S PRESENCE ANXIOUSLY WAITED FOR HIM TO COMMENCE
MY HEART BEGAN TO THROB WILDLY WHILE MY BRAIN SEEMED ON FIRE
WHY SHOULD MISS STAGGLES POSE AS A GHOST EVEN AT THE INSTIGATION OF VOLTAIRE
YOU ARE COWED AT LAST ARE YOU HE SAID MOCKINGLY
THEN A WOMAN CAME ALONE
ANYHOW I WENT
EVIDENTLY THE LADIES WERE NOT SORRY TO SEE US FOR A LOOK OF PLEASURE AND SURPRISE GREETED US AND SOON THE CONVERSATION BECAME GENERAL
SIMON SLOWDEN COULDN'T HEV BIN SICH A NINCOMPOOP IF HE HADN'T BIN WACCINATED GAINST WHOOPIN COUGH MEASLES AND SMALL-POX
A THOUSAND MEN ANSWERING TO KAFFAR'S DESCRIPTION MIGHT BE SEEN EVERY DAY
THE MONTHS WERE SLIPPING BY
AM I BOLD TO SPEAK THUS I ASKED
THE BEAUTIES ARE INCOMPARABLE
BUT STILL I LOOKED AND STILL I REMEMBERED
SO I GOES OME AND I SAYS I'LL WRITE ER A LETTER AS WOULD CHARM A DEAD DUCK IN A SAUCEPAN
ALTHOUGH BY UNLAWFUL MEANS YOU MAY HAVE OBTAINED MASTERY OVER ME AS SURELY AS THERE IS A GOD WHO CARES FOR MEN YOUR POWER WILL BE BROKEN
I AM NOT A FOLLOWER OF VOLTAIRE ALTHOUGH I ADMIRE HIS GENIUS
I FELT IN NO MOOD FOR LOOKING AT THEM JUST THEN HOWEVER AND SO WALKED TO A WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT ON THE SNOW-DRAPED LANDSCAPE THAT STRETCHED AWAY ON EVERY HAND
FANCY ME A-SEEIN THINGS IN ITALY AND TELLIN EM TO YOU WITHOUT KNOWIN ANYTHING ABOUT IT
SLOWDEN WILL COME BY TRAIN LEAVING LEEDS 11.38
WE SHALL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DON'T I CANNOT RESIST THE LADIES HE SAID WITH A SMILE BUT YOU MUST NOT BE FRIGHTENED AT MY STORY
I INSTINCTIVELY FELT THAT THIS WAS A MAN OF POWER ONE WHO WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE HIS WILL LAW
I ASK HOWEVER THAT I MAY BE BELIEVED WHEN I SAY THIS
ONLY THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF MYSTERY CAN THINK RIGHTLY ABOUT WHAT LIES IN THE MIND AND HEART OF THE TRUE MAGICIAN
WE REACHED TEMPLE HALL IN DUE TIME WHERE I WAS KINDLY WELCOMED BY MRS TEMPLE AND HER TWO DAUGHTERS
IT COULD DO NO HARM IT MIGHT DO GOOD
I CAN EXPLAIN NOTHING NEITHER CAN I HE LOOKED AT ME KEENLY AND SIGHED
SUCH AT ANY RATE AS I COULD USE
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THEM TO HELP ME
THE TRUTH IS I AM VERY UNFORTUNATE IN MANY RESPECTS
MR BLAKE SHE CONTINUED I NEVER MUST MARRY HIM GOD GRANT YOU MAY NOT I SAID
KAFFAR IS NOT AN ORDINARY-LOOKING MAN AND FROM SCOTLAND YARD OUR POLICE AUTHORITIES HOLD COMMUNICATION WITH ALL OTHER POLICE AUTHORITIES IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD
I WAS PAINFULLY AWARE THAT MISS FORREST MUST THINK I WAS ACTING STRANGELY AND DISCOURTEOUSLY AND ONCE OR TWICE I ESSAYED TO GO BACK TO HER BUT I COULD NOT I WAS DRAWN ON AND ON ALWAYS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE
IN THAT TIME I THOUGHT I COULD HUNT EVERY LODGING-HOUSE AND HOTEL IN THE CITY
THE DETECTIVES HAD DONE ALL THAT MEN COULD DO
IF YOU WILL WELL I SAID AFTER THAT ERE WILLAIN EXPERIMENTED ON ME IN YORKSHIRE I NEVER WOULD AGAIN
FETCH HELFA SAID ABOU TO A SERVANT AND THEN BEGONE HELFA WAS ABOU'S SON
THE REGION WAS VERY DREAR AND MOREOVER THE PLACE HAD A BAD REPUTATION
NEVER SHALL I FORGET THE LOOK OF HATRED THAT GLEAMED FROM HIS EYES AS HE LEFT THE ROOM
AS I KNEW I SHOULD I FOUND VOLTAIRE THERE
IT IS BY GOOD LUCK WE ARE HERE BUT NEITHER OF US HAVE THE MEANS TO PASS AS ENGLISH ARISTOCRATS VERY LONG
I CLOSED WITH THE YOUTH'S OFFER AND ACCORDINGLY WE WALKED DOWN THE STREET TOGETHER
IT IS THIS
THEY ALL TURNED AS I SPOKE AND MISS FORREST GAVE A SCREAM
HEROD THIS SON OF MINE WAS BORN JUST THE DAY BEFORE HIS FATHER WAS KILLED IN A DUEL
I AM HEDGED IN ON EVERY SIDE
YOU SHUDDER AT THE PROBLEM OF WHAT YOU CALL DEATH AND FANCY NOTHING CAN BE KNOWN OF THE SPIRIT WHICH LEAVES THE WORLD IN WHICH YOU LIVE
NEITHER WILL I SPEAK OF MY HOPES AND FEARS WITH REGARD TO THIS IDEA OF FINDING KAFFAR'S WHEREABOUTS BY MEANS OF CLAIRVOYANCE
IF EVER MY PROMISE HAS TO BE FULFILLED I SHALL DIE THE VERY DAY ON WHICH HE CALLS ME WIFE MY HEART GAVE A GREAT THROB OF JOY
CHRISTMAS EVE III
I DID NOT LIKE HIM
SO THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF SHE'S DEPOSITED SOME O HER COMBUSTIBLE MATTER IN MR BLAKE'S ROOM IT WAS A BOLD AND DANGEROUS THING TO DO YER HONOUR BUT I GOES INTO YOUR ROOM AND LOOKS AROUND
BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK
THREE HOURS AND A HALF SIR THIS WAS AN AWFUL BLOW TO ME
I TOOK IT AND READ HEROD VOLTAIRE SHOW HIM UP I SAID TO THE SERVANT
I HAVE FREED YOU FROM THAT MAN THANK GOD YOU HAVE SHE SAID WITH A SHUDDER
BUT I CANNOT HELP IT
I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL SPIRITUALIST PSYCHOLOGIST OR BIOLOGIST
WILL YOU COME AND SPEND A FORTNIGHT OR SO AT TEMPLE HALL
I SHALL NOT TRY AND RELATE WHAT HAPPENED THE NEXT TWO DAYS EXCEPT TO SAY THAT I SET SIMON TO WATCH EVERY TRAIN THAT CAME INTO TURIN STATION WHILE I DID ALL I COULD TO DISCOVER WHETHER HE WERE HIDING IN TURIN
I RECALLED DIMLY THE STRUGGLE THE FIGHTING THE STRANGE FEELING I HAD AS MY SENSES BEGAN TO LEAVE ME
PARTLY BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONLY PASSENGER AND PARTLY BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO STRANGE
I THINK I MUST BE FOR I HAVE SCARCELY KNOWN YOU A WEEK
SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY OR I'M GOING BACK YES HE SAID REVEALING HIS WHITE TEETH I AM GOING TO SAY WHAT I WANT TO SAY AND YOU ARE NOT GOING BACK UNTIL YOU HAVE HEARD IT AND MORE THAN THAT PROMISED TO ACCEDE TO IT AGAIN I FELT A COLD SHIVER CREEP OVER ME BUT I PUT ON A BOLD FACE AND SAID IT ALWAYS TAKES TWO TO PLAY AT ANY GAME YES IT DOES MR BLAKE AND THAT YOU'LL FIND OUT
BUT ADMITTING WHAT YOU SAY YOU ARE ALL CAST IN THE SAME MOULD
SHE IS EVIDENTLY STRONG AND DETERMINED AND CAN BE FORCED TO DO NOTHING NONSENSE SNARLED THE EGYPTIAN
CAUSE I'D RATHER HEV CHOLERA HOOPIN COUGH AND SMALL-POX ALL TOGETHER THAN BE WACCINATED
THROUGH IT THE SECRETS OF ASTRONOMER AND ASTROLOGER WOULD BE KNOWN WHILE THE PAGES OF THE PAST WOULD LIE BEFORE HIM LIKE AN OPEN BOOK
THE STREETS IS AS SLIPPERY AS GLASS AND AS CROWDED AS HERRIN'S IN A BARREL
AND SO I COMMAND YOU HE CONTINUED IN A HOARSE TONE THAT MADE ME SHUDDER THAT YOU DO NOT MOVE ONE STEP IN THAT DIRECTION
AS I LOOKED AT HIS TERRIBLE EYES MY PASSION BECAME GREATER AND I FELT I COULD NOT GOVERN MYSELF IF I STAYED IN THE ROOM
BOLOGNA THAT'S IT
I HAD MADE HIM MY ENEMY AND THE THOUGHT WAS TERRIBLE
SHE IS INTENSELY PROUD AS LUCIFER INTERRUPTED MISS STAGGLES
AND BESIDES THAT I TOLD HER THAT HER MARKED PREFERENCE FOR HIM WAS BEING TALKED ABOUT YES SAYS WOLTAIRE AND SEE HOW SHE'S TREATED HIM SINCE TRUE ENOUGH SAYS SHE
I HAVE ONLY HINTED AT WHAT REALLY EXISTS
LOVE ASTONISHMENT PAIN VEXATION OR JOY
AND MARK YOU THIS TOO
IF THE ITALIAN WERE DECEIVING ME
BUT I THINK IT OUR RIGHT SAID VOLTAIRE
ALL THE MALIGNITY AND CRUELTY THAT COULD BE EXPRESSED IN A HUMAN FACE I THOUGHT I SAW EXPRESSED IN HIS
THROUGH HELFA ABOU HAD SEEN MANY WONDERFUL THINGS AND NOW HE WAS GOING TO USE HIM AGAIN
NOT ANOTHER WORD AND SEIZING HIM BY THE COLLAR I SHOOK HIM FURIOUSLY
AFTER A NUMBER OF ARTICLES WERE SHOWN AND DESCRIBED KAFFAR WAS RECALLED AND WAS LOUDLY APPLAUDED
BUT IF HE CAN BE MADE TO LEAVE HER AND NEVER SPEAK TO HER AGAIN WILL IT NOT SHOW TO HER THAT HE'S WHAT YOU SAID HE WAS AND THUS TURN HER AGAINST HIM I DON'T KNOW
I WANDERED IN THE PLANTATION FOR HOURS BROODING THINKING DESPAIRING
ON ONE SIDE WAS WILD MOORLAND AND ON THE OTHER A PLANTATION OF FIRS EDGED THE DISMAL POND
WE GOT INTO THE HOTEL JUST IN TIME FOR DINNER
THIS WAS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL AS HE WAS GENERALLY VERY BLAND AND POLITE BUT TO-NIGHT HE WAS SO CANTANKEROUS THAT I FANCIED HE MUST HAVE BEEN DRINKING
I HOPE YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY VALUABLES GONE TO-MORROW REAL OR NOT SAID TOM GAILY I'M GLAD IT CAME HOW'S THAT IT GAVE ME NERVE TO POP THE QUESTION HE REPLIED
OF WHAT I ASKED
ABOU AND I WERE ALONE WITH THE TWO BODIES
YOUR ENGLISH LAW IS STERN
IF I CANNOT HAVE LOVE I MUST HAVE VENGEANCE BUT YOU HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
SURELY THAT FACE SHOWED AN EARNESTNESS BEYOND THE COMMON INTEREST OF A PASSING ACQUAINTANCE
IT WUR IN THIS WAY SUR
TRULY DOES OUR GREATEST POET SAY WE ARE SUCH STUFF AS DREAMS ARE MADE OF AND OUR LITTLE LIFE IS ROUNDED WITH A SLEEP TOM TEMPLE IS MARRIED AND LIVES HAPPILY AT TEMPLE HALL
I MUST I MUST SHE CRIED
BUT--WELL I WILL BE MERCIFUL ON ONE CONDITION OH WHAT-WHAT THAT YOU WILL COME BACK TO ENGLAND WITH ME AT ONCE I CANNOT
THE EXPERIENCES WHICH YOU HAVE HAD WOULD MAKE YOU VERY UNCERTAIN THEN YOUR ADVICE IS SEND FOR THIS MAN AT ONCE
I A YOUNG STRONG MAN WAS A SLAVE--A SLAVE OF THE WORST KIND
THIS INK WAS THE MOST PRECIOUS IN HIS POSSESSION AND OBTAINED BY MEANS NOT LAWFUL TO RELATE
I HAD RAISED SUSPICIONS AND NOW I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION I WANTED
THE TRUTH IS I'M NOT A LADIES MAN AND HENCE NOT LIKED BY THEM
BUT SHE MUST BE WON AND WON FAIRLY
I DID NOT WAIT FOR HER REPLY BUT TURNED MY HEAD IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION
I ENTERED THE ROOM AN OLD-FASHIONED DARK PLACE LINED ON EVERY SIDE WITH BOOKS
ABOVE OUR HEADS WAVED TALL PALM TREES
YOU SHALL BE DRAGGED THROUGH MIRE DIRT PAIN DEFEAT DISGRACE AND THEN WHEN ALL IS OVER YOU WILL FIND I HAVE HAD MY OWN WAY HE MADE A STEP TOWARDS ME
I WAS SILENT AND FEARFUL FOR I FELT SURE THE EGYPTIAN MEDITATED ESCAPE
NO YOU MUST COME AGAIN IN THE MORNING
BUT THAT AIN'T MY FAULT MA'AM
IT'S DARK THEN AND EVERYBODY WILL BE INDOORS THEN YER HONOUR THEY WENT AWAY TOGETHER AND I WAS ON THE LOOK-OUT FOR YOU ALL DAY YESTERDAY THERE WAS MUCH IN SIMON'S STORY TO THINK ABOUT AND FOR A TIME ALL WAS MYSTERY TO ME
KILL HIM HE REPLIED
PERCHANCE A HANGMAN'S ROPE WAS HANGING NEAR ME EVEN NOW
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT WE ENGLISH PEOPLE GENERALLY TRY TO GET AN EMPTY CARRIAGE AND FEEL ANNOYED WHEN SOME ONE COMES IN TO SHARE OUR POSSESSION
BLAKE ESQ GOWER STREET LONDON W SURELY I KNOW THE WRITING I MUSED AND THEN BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE POSTMARKS AS IF A LETTER WERE SOMETHING OF VERY UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE
KAFFAR WAS NOT DEAD
THEY HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT HERE AS I HAVE AND SURELY TWO FRIENDS CAN LEAVE THE HOUSE AND COME OUT FOR A STROLL WITHOUT BEING WATCHED WITH THIS THOUGHT IN MY MIND I TURNED TO GO BACK AGAIN WHEN I HEARD VOICES CLOSE BY ME
WE WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUND AND CAME TO DREARWATER POND DREARWATER POND
IF I ONLY COULD
I DID NOT KNOW
THE PREACHERS WERE WRONG
NO I SAID
THIS TRAVELLER HAD ALSO TOLD HIM HE HAD COME FROM ENGLAND THE LAND OF LUXURY AND GOLD AND WAS GOING TO CAIRO
ARRIVING AT THE HOUSE I SAW SIMON SLOWDEN
BUT THIS GHOST DIDN'T LOOK MADE UP
P.S.--I MIGHT SAY THAT MOST OF THE GUESTS WILL ARRIVE ON CHRISTMAS EVE
CHAPTER VIII DARKNESS AND LIGHT DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS THERE WAS BUT LITTLE TO RECORD
BUT A STORM WAS BLOWING AND I KNEW THAT MEANT A LONGER SEA-PASSAGE SO I WENT TO CALAIS THUS RIDING THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST UNINTERESTING PARTS OF FRANCE
LOVE CANNOT BE GREATER THAN MINE
I CANNOT REMEMBER ANY MORE FOR I WAS SO TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
CAN'T YOU SEE IT COURSE I CAN'T
I FELT MORE THAN EVER A LOST MAN
HE STUCK TO ME LIKE A LIMPET TO A ROCK PERHAPS IT WAS ALL FANCY SIMON NO FANCY IN ME BUT A LOT O JUDGMENT
AFTER I HAD COME DOWN FROM HERE LAST NIGHT AND FANCYING THAT EVERY ONE HAD RETIRED FOR IT WAS QUITE MIDNIGHT I KNOWING I WAS TOO EXCITED TO SLEEP MADE MY WAY TO THE LIBRARY
BUT IF I WOULD GO WITH HIM HE WOULD DIRECT ME TO A SPLENDID PLACE MARVELLOUSLY CONVENIENT MARVELLOUSLY CLEAN AND MARVELLOUSLY CHEAP AND BEST OF ALL KEPT BY HIS MOTHER'S SISTER
SO MUCH PLEASED WAS I WITH THIS INTERVIEW THAT I HAD NO FEAR THAT MY ENEMY WOULD NOT BE WELL LOOKED AFTER
BUT I TELL YOU YOU SHALL REPENT ALL THIS
ANOTHER YOUTH CAME UP TO ME SOON AFTER OFFERING TO SELL ME PHOTOGRAPHS OF SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL SIGHTS IN TURIN
HE WAS A BEAUTIFUL HIGH-BLOODED CREATURE AND SEEMED TO DELIGHT IN MAKING THE SNOW CRYSTALS FLY AROUND HIM AS HE SCAMPERED OVER THE FROZEN GROUND
I AM SURE WE SHOULD ALL LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER MR BLAKE IS CONVINCED I AM CONVINCED THAT MR KAFFAR HAS A GOOD MEMORY I SAID
KAFFAR HELD DOWN HIS HEAD FOR A MINUTE AND THEN SAID HASTILY AND HIS MESSAGE SOMETHING TO YOUR ADVANTAGE SIR MY ADVANTAGE
POSSIBLY I WAS A MURDERER IN ACT IF NOT IN THOUGHT
ARE THEY ALL EUROPEANS I ASKED
THUS IT WAS WITH A THROBBING HEART THAT I STOOD THERE ALONE UPON THE LAWN WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY NEW-FOUND LOVE JUST BREAKING UPON ME AND MORE THAN THAT I HAD EVERY REASON TO FEAR THAT SHE WAS TO BE MADE THE DUPE OF TWO CLEVER VILLAINS
I HAVE STAYED UP LATE MR TEMPLE SHE SAID TO TOM IN ORDER TO ARRANGE SOMEWHAT FOR THE PARTY YOU PROPOSE GIVING ON THURSDAY
SHE IS JEST GWINE TO BED HE SAID
MY HEART BECAME LIKE LEAD
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
NO REPLIED VOLTAIRE
I WOULD SOONER LOSE IT A THOUSAND TIMES OVER THAN BE LATE IN REACHING KENSINGTON
AND YET HE WORE HIS OLD FASCINATING SMILE
ONLY ONE HERE AND THERE COMES TO US AND THEN WE ARE TREATED AS NO OTHER SCIENTIFIC MAN WOULD BE TREATED
ITS INTEREST IS MORE THAN ORDINARY BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH THE FASCINATING SUBJECTS OF ANIMAL MAGNETISM MESMERISM AND SPIRITUALISM
THE MAN WITH THE LANDLORD WAS KAFFAR
I HAVE NOT VOLUNTEERED ANY OPINION EITHER AS TO MR VOLTAIRE'S STORY OR YOUR PERFORMANCE
BUT I COULD NOT HINDER THE TURN THINGS HAD TAKEN SO WE STARTED OUR HORSES INTO A GALLOP I HOPING THAT SOON ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY MIGHT OCCUR FOR OUR BEING ALONE WHEN I TRUSTED SHE WOULD TELL ME WHAT I DESIRED TO KNOW
I WATCHED THE PARTY RIDE AWAY--IT WAS COMPARATIVELY SMALL NOW FOR SEVERAL HAD RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES--AND THEN I FOUND MY WAY TO THE LIBRARY
I LIKE THE REST OF MY COUNTRYMEN ARE APT TO DO IN SUCH A CASE BEGAN TO HOPE I MIGHT RETAIN THE ENTIRE USE OF THE CARRIAGE AT LEAST TO LEEDS WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND A PORTER BROUGHT A NUMBER OF WRAPS AND SHAWLS EVIDENTLY THE PROPERTY OF A LADY
STILL NO RELIABLE NEWS
YET I THOUGHT I SAW A BLUSH MOUNT HER CHEEK AS SHE SPOKE
DISTINCTLY MOVED NEAR TO WHERE I STOOD AND FROM THEIR DARK DEPTHS SOMETHING APPEARED--I COULD NOT AT FIRST TELL WHAT
I AM WRITING A LETTER TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NEAREST POLICE STATION TELLING HIM TO COME WITH SOME MEN TO TEMPLE HALL TO ARREST A MURDERER HAVE YOU NO MERCY SHE SAID
MISS FORREST WE EASTERNS ARE NOT LIKE YOU ENGLISH PEOPLE
NO NO ONE NO ONE THAT WILL DIVULGE ANYTHING
I SHALL MAKE YOU YOU CANNOT HE JEERED
SOME SAY THAT IF ANY ONE SEES THE PLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME ALONE HIS HANDS WILL BE RED WITH BLOOD BEFORE A MONTH PASSES AWAY THEN THAT WILL REFER TO ME I SAID
SHE TURNED HER HEAD TO REPLY AND I WAS BENDING MY HEAD SO AS NOT TO MISS A WORD WHEN A SUBTLE POWER SEIZED ME
THE HOTEL PROPRIETOR DID NOT THINK THE GENTLEMAN CARRIED ANY LUGGAGE BUT HE WOULD INQUIRE
SURELY YOU ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED IN ME TO SAVE ME FROM A MAN LIKE VOLTAIRE INTERESTED I CRIED
AND WHAT DID YOU THINK SHE WAS LIKE LIKE THE HALL GHOST AS I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT SAID SIMON
THE GREAT GIANT MOUNTAINS TOWERING UP ON EVERY HAND WERE A REVELATION TO HIM AND HE STOOD OPEN-MOUTHED GAZING AT WHAT IS PERHAPS AMONG THE GRANDEST SIGHTS IN FRANCE
BUT I DON'T THINK SO
SOMEHOW I FELT THAT THIS FASCINATING MAN DID NOT LIKE ME WHILE I WAS SURE HE HAD BEEN DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THE WOMAN WHO HAD THAT DAY TRAVELLED WITH ME FROM LONDON
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS ALL JANE I ASKED
I CANNOT BUT ADMIT HOWEVER THAT I WAS SOMEWHAT ANXIOUS AS TO THE DESTINATION OF GERTRUDE FORREST FOR CERTAINLY SHE HAD MADE AN IMPRESSION UPON ME I WAS NOT LIKELY TO FORGET
YOUR STORY ON THE OTHER HAND IS A BRILLIANT SUCCESS
I COULD GET SIMON TO MY ROOM AND GIVE HIM SOME BREAKFAST AND THEN AFTER A LITTLE REST DRIVE DIRECT TO THE PROFESSOR'S
THAT WAS THE MEMORY OF A CRUEL LOOK WHICH RESTED ON VOLTAIRE'S FACE AS WE WENT AWAY TOGETHER
AH I LONG FOR VENGEANCE ON THE MAN WHO MURDERED MY DEAR FRIEND THEN YOU WILL NOT RELEASE MISS FORREST NEVER THEN I SHALL MAKE YOU YOU MAKE ME HE CRIED SAVAGELY
WE HAD GONE OUT QUIETLY AND HAD ATTRACTED NO NOTICE AND RODE AWAY TOWARDS THE RUINS OF AN OLD CASTLE WHICH TOM THOUGHT WE SHOULD LIKE TO VISIT
EVEN GERTRUDE FORREST WAS CARRIED AWAY BY IT WHILE MISS EDITH GRAY WAS ENRAPTURED AT WHAT SHE TERMED A GLORIOUS MYSTERY I SHOULD LIKE SAID MISS STAGGLES TO HEAR WHAT MR BLAKE THE THOMAS OF THE PARTY HAS TO SAY TO IT THERE WAS AN UGLY LEER IN THE OLD WOMAN'S EYE AS SHE SPOKE AND THE THOUGHT STRUCK ME THAT VOLTAIRE HAD BEEN MAKING FRIENDS WITH HER
THE HEAT HAD DRIVEN THE TOURISTS AWAY TO COLDER CLIMES
SIMON BEGAN TO DESCRIBE BUT WE COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT
YOU MATCHED YOUR STRENGTH WITH MINE
I DID NOT WONDER AT IT
YOU KNOW I WILL GLADLY BE YOUR WIFE I WILL NOT WRITE OF WHAT HAPPENED THEN
IT WAS NOT I WHO REALLY DID THE DEED
WE HAD GONE PERHAPS TWO MILES FROM THE HOUSE WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES SEPARATED FROM TOM TEMPLE AND MISS GRAY AND WE SLACKENED OUR HORSES SPEED TO A WALK
BUT I COULD NOT DO IT
AND NOW I HAVE COME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE AROUSED THE ANGER OF A MAN WHO LAUGHS AT CONVENTIONAL LAWS AND SNAPS HIS FINGERS AT THE ORDINARY USAGES OF SOCIETY--ONE WHO KNOWS NOTHING AND CARES NOTHING FOR YOUR CLAPTRAP MORALITY AND WILL NOT BE INFLUENCED BY IT I AM SORRY IF I HAVE ANGERED YOU I REPLIED HUMBLY
YOU SHALL SEE US GO AWAY TOGETHER--THE WOMAN YOU LOVE AND THE MAN WHO HAS CRUSHED YOU AS IF YOU WERE A WORM THIS MADDENED ME
GOD DID NOT CARE FOR HE HELPED ME NOT
MY LOVE FOR GERTRUDE FORREST WAS REAL
HE WAS NOT AT THE STATION
THIS CONSIDERABLY MOLLIFIED HER SO MY GUIDE PROCEEDED TO LEAD THE WAY TO THE OTHER LODGING-HOUSE
IT WAS BY NO MEANS PLEASANT TO HAVE TO SIT AND LISTEN TO HER HOARSE VOICE SO I PULLED DOWN THE LAPS OF MY TRAVELLING CAP OVER MY EARS AND CLOSING MY EYES BEGAN TO THINK WHO GERTRUDE FORREST WAS AND WHERE SHE WAS GOING
SO AFTER THANKING THE LADY FOR HER KINDNESS AND PAYING FOR THE CIGARETTES I ASKED THE BOY WHO WAS WAITING FOR HIS FRANC TO SHOW ME TO THE OTHER LODGING-HOUSE CLOSE BY
A MONSTER OF FRIGHTFUL MIEN
IT WAS INDEED A DREARY PLACE
SHE HAS A FINE HOUSE IN ENGLAND'S CAPITAL
MIGHT I ASK WHEN HE WILL BE HOME I ASKED EAGERLY
BELIEVE ME LADY IT WAS ALL BECAUSE I LOVED YOU THAT I HAVE ACTED AS I HAVE
NONE HAD SUFFICIENT INDIVIDUALITY TO MAKE A DISTINCT IMPRESSION UPON ME
I WILL SNAP YOUR CRUEL CHAIN ASUNDER I DEFY YOU HE SAID
THE LAUGHTER OF THE LIGHT-HEARTED FRENCH PEOPLE WHO WERE PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES GRATED ON MY EARS
THIS CHRISTMAS DAY IS LIKE SUNDAY TO YOU ENGLISH FOLK AND I DO NOT WISH TO MAR ITS SACREDNESS OH THE SUNDAY PART OF IT IS ALL ENDED AT TWELVE O'CLOCK CRIED THE YOUNG LADY WHO HAD SPOKEN FIRST
THIS FEELING POSSESSED ME TILL WE ARRIVED AT TEMPLE HALL WHEN I FELT FREE AND AS IF BY THE WAVE OF SOME MAGICAL WAND JUSTIN BLAKE WAS HIMSELF AGAIN
NOW WHERE IS YOUR POWER AND WHERE ARE THE CHARGES YOU HAVE BROUGHT HAD HE A PISTOL I BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE SHOT ME DEAD
BUT AS SURE AS WE ARE ALIVE SHE LIKES HIM HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS I SAW THEM COME IN FROM THEIR RIDE AND SO I GUESSED THAT THEY HAD BECOME FRIENDLY AGAIN WELL WELL I MET HER IN THE HALL
INDEED I FOUND OUT AFTERWARDS THAT SHE HAD BEEN VERY ANXIOUS
THEN WHY MUST YOU HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE DEALINGS WITH ME
I LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND ALL SEEMED ASTOUNDED AT THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE EGYPTIAN SAVE VOLTAIRE WHO WAS APOLOGIZING IN PROFUSE TERMS FOR HIS FRIEND
MY LIFE WAS STRANGE AND DISAPPOINTING
I SAW THAT MR BLAKE REFRAINED FROM CRUSHING HIM BENEATH HIS HEEL LIKE A REPTILE
DIRECTLY AFTER DINNER I WENT OUT TO TRY TO FIND KAFFAR'S WHEREABOUTS
BUT I SAW NOTHING OF AN HOTEL
SO I LIED LUFF
I WILL ALLOW NO POSSIBILITY OF A SYSTEM IN THIS AND CONSEQUENTLY I SHALL BE GLAD IF ANY GENTLEMAN WILL HELP ME IN THE MANIFESTATION OF THE HIDDEN POWERS OF THE HUMAN MIND
HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A SAVAGE LEER
I THINK HE IS A FAR BETTER MAN THAN HE WAS BUT I AM NOT AT ALL SORRY THAT HE DISLIKES ENGLAND
BUT MORE THAN THAT THE POND IS SAID TO HAVE AN EVIL POWER
YOU ASK ME MUCH HE CONTINUED
THERE IS ONLY ONE MEANS BY WHICH THE PERSON UNDER THIS INFLUENCE CAN BE FREE
AND AS VOLTAIRE HAD PUBLICLY SPOKEN OF KAFFAR'S LUGGAGE BEING SENT TO CAIRO THERE WAS TO THEM NO MYSTERY REGARDING HIM
HAVE YOU MANY LODGERS NOW I ASKED
THAT HE'S HAD DOZENS OF LOVE AFFAIRS WITH GIRLS
I SEEMED TO SEE RIVERS OF BLOOD AND OVER THEM FLOATED AWFUL CREATURES
AS WE LEFT THE TABLE I TURNED TOWARDS VOLTAIRE AND I FOUND THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT US
YOU FEEL TOWARDS THEM JUST AS I DO
AT BEST A POOR WEAK CREATURE THE PLAYTHING OF A VILLAIN
I FELT THAT HER LIFE WAS GIVEN TO ME
YOU ARE A WEAKER MAN THAN I--WEAKER UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES
AFTER THAT I TOOK TRAIN FOR DOVER AND PREPARED TO TRACK KAFFAR IF POSSIBLE WHEREVER HE HAD GONE NOT REALIZING AT THE TIME THE TASK I HAD PROPOSED FOR MYSELF
I OWED IT TO THE WOMAN I LOVED
AS YOU SAY SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND UPON MY HONOUR I HAVE VERY NEARLY FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER
YOU SEE YOU HAVE RISEN TO FAME AND I HAVE REMAINED IN OBSCURITY
THE OLDER PART OF CAIRO WAS SIMPLY UNBEARABLE
HE ASSURED ME THAT MY SURMISE WAS CORRECT AND FORTHWITH BEGAN TO ENUMERATE THE ADVANTAGES RECEIVED BY THOSE WHO WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE RECEIVED AS LODGERS
BUT PERHAPS YOU'LL BE MORE FORTUNATE NEXT TIME
IT IS LITTLE I CAN RECALL TO MEMORY NOW CONCERNING HER BUT I KNOW THAT WHEN SHE FIRST SET HER EYE UPON ME SHE SAID EH MRS BLAKE BUT YON BAIRN HAS THE GIFT O SECOND SIGHT MY MOTHER LAUGHED AT THE IDEA WHEREUPON THE OLD WOMAN BEGAN TO CORRECT HERSELF
THAT'S IT THANK YOU
BUT WE DID NOT THINK TO FIND SUCH A QUEEN
WE HAD SEVERAL REASONS FOR DOING THIS
I'M CRYIN ALL THE DAY AS THOUGH I GOT MY LIVIN WI SKINNIN ONIONS
ALTHOUGH THE MESSAGE WAS FLASHED WITH LIGHTNING SPEED IT SEEMED A LONG TIME IN COMING
ANYHOW IT AROUSED MR VOLTAIRE FOR AS HE LOOKED AT ME THERE WAS THE LOOK OF A DEMON IN HIS FACE AND HIS HAND TREMBLED
STILL IT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR MUCH AFTER ONE HAS READ DUMAS MEMOIRS OF A PHYSICIAN AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DOUBT THE TRUTH OF MY WORDS ASKED VOLTAIRE SHARPLY
ON THE 2ND OF JANUARY OF THE PRESENT YEAR I SAID A MAN DISAPPEARED IN THE NIGHT FROM A PLACE IN YORKSHIRE
THIS THOUGHT HAD SCARCELY ENTERED MY MIND WHEN TWO MEN ENTERED THE ROOM WHO WERE CERTAINLY NOT OF THE ORDINARY TYPE AND WILL NEED A FEW WORDS OF DESCRIPTION
BUT I AM AFRAID HE HAS NOT BEEN UNDER THIS INFLUENCE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF TIMES FOR HIS VISION TO BE CLEAR
THERE'S ONLY YOU TO BE SILENT
HAVE MERCY HE SAID
I DO NOT USE IT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PAY ME TO DO SO
WHY SHOULD MISS STAGGLES BE SO WILLING TO HELP HEROD VOLTAIRE AND WHAT WERE THE DESIGNS IN HIS MIND
I WISH YOU A HAPPY NEW YEAR MISS FORREST I SAID
LISTLESSLY I OPENED IT AND THE FIRST WORDS THAT CAUGHT MY EYES WERE REVIEWS OF BOOKS I GLANCED DOWN THE COLUMN AND SAW THE WORDS DAVID ELGINBROD BY GEORGE MACDONALD
LEEDS IS A GREAT COMMERCIAL CENTRE WHERE MEN OF EVERY NATIONALITY MEET AND OF COURSE KAFFAR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO PASS UNNOTICED
WHY THEN SHOULD SUCH A TERRIBLE SUSPICION BE AROUSED
HEROD SEND ON MY BAGGAGE TO CAIRO
I COULD FIND TRACES OF HIM NOWHERE
WHAT WAS HER ANSWER MAN SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH LOATHING BUT HE DID NOT SEE IT
BUT I KNOW THAT HER LOOK MADE ME VERY HAPPY AS SHE TOGETHER WITH EDITH GRAY ENTERED HER ROOM A FEW MINUTES AFTER
WE--THAT IS MOTHER THE GIRLS AND MYSELF--ARE CONTEMPLATING A REAL JOLLY CHRISTMAS
VOLTAIRE'S INFLUENCE OVER ME IS GONE AND NOW HE IS IN MY POWER
BY THAT ONE ACT LAST NIGHT YOU PLACED YOURSELF IN MY POWER AND NOW YOU ARE MY SLAVE
SO FAR I MIGHT CONGRATULATE MYSELF ON MAKING FORWARD STEPS
YOU'VE BROUGHT HIM SAID HE
AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES I REPLIED
THEN LOOKING UP AT ME SHE SAID WITH THE HAPPY LOOK I LOVED TO SEE AND I HEARTILY RETURN YOUR WISH MR BLAKE THERE WAS NO COLDNESS NO RESTRAINT IN HER VOICE
THEY SEE HALF-A-DOZEN MOVES AHEAD AND SO DO THAT WHICH TO A NOVICE APPEARS MEANINGLESS AND ABSURD THEN I HEARD ANOTHER VOICE ONE THAT CAUSED MY HEART TO BEAT WILDLY
I WOULD BRAKE THE CHAINS VOLTAIRE HAD FORGED
YOUR DESCRIPTION MAY BE INCORRECT OR A HUNDRED MEN MIGHT ANSWER TO IT
I WILL FREE MYSELF FROM YOU
NO PHANTOMS NO SHADOW NOTHING UNREAL SAVE THE MEMORY OF THAT WHICH I HAVE BUT DIMLY DESCRIBED
I RANG THE BELL VIOLENTLY AND A SERVANT APPEARED AT THE DOOR
I'M TOUGH HAS A CROCODILE'S TONGUE AND CAN STAND A GOODISH BIT O JINGO AND NONSENSE
WHILE MISS STAGGLES HAD BEEN MUMBLING SOMETHING ABOUT SHOWING ME OUT OF DOORS
I'VE BEEN IN THEATRES YER HONOUR AND PLAYED IN PIECES AND I'VE KNOWN THE WILLAIN IN THE PLAY GET UP A SHINDY LIKE THIS
PON MY WORD IT'S LUCKY THOSE JUGGLING FELLOWS CAN'T COME
THEN WHEN OUR JOY WAS FULLEST A CHOIR FROM A NEIGHBOURING CHURCH BEGAN TO SING CHRISTIANS AWAKE SALUTE THE HAPPY MORN WHEREON THE SAVIOUR OF MANKIND WAS BORN IT WAS INDEED A HAPPY CHRISTMAS MORN TO US
I WAS ABLE TO CONNECT CAUSE AND EFFECT
I COULD SCARCELY RESTRAIN FROM STRIKING HIM TO THE GROUND
HAVE YOU THOUGHT MY CONDUCT STRANGE SINCE WE LAST RODE OUT TOGETHER SHE SAID
HE FASCINATED ME AND IN A DEGREE MASTERED ME BUT DID NOT SUCCEED IN ALL HIS DESIRES
THANK GOD FOR THAT
AND YET A GREAT JOY FILLED MY HEART
MR BLAKE SHE SAID MY SOUL LOATHES THE THOUGHT OF MARRYING THAT MAN
SHE SPOKE TOO LOW
BECAUSE THERE ARE FORCES OVER WHICH I HAVE NO CONTROL DRAWING ME ON BUT WHY WILL THEY HAVE DEALINGS WITH YOU
GOOD-MORNING I WILL NOT TRY TO DESCRIBE HOW I PASSED THE DAY
I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU THANK YOU TOM
WHEN I AWOKE THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND LOOKED OUT I SAW THAT THE GREAT YORKSHIRE HILLS WERE COVERED WITH SNOW THE AIR WAS BITINGLY COLD AND THE LEADEN SKY PROMISED US SOME REAL CHRISTMAS WEATHER
THERE THE GOLDEN SANDHILLS STRETCH AWAY THE PALM TREES WAVE THE NILE SWEEPS MAJESTIC
FLEE TO THE HOME OF SPIRITS AND BRING BACK THE SOUL OF THY SISTER THAT SHE MAY TELL ME WHAT WE WISH TO KNOW WHEN THE COMMAND WAS GIVEN I FELT THAT A SOMETHING--AN ENTITY--WAS GONE FROM US
I WOULD NOT TAMELY ADMIT HIS VICTORY AFTER I HAD OPENLY DEFEATED HIM BEFORE
VOLTAIRE SAID YOU WERE MAD FOR MY LIFE
I WOULD SIFT A LITTLE DEEPER
THEN WE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THREE PEOPLE RIDING
BUT I DID NOT ANSWER THEM AND AFTER A WHILE THE SUBJECT DROPPED
MAN WHERE IS HE NOW HOW CAN I SAY SAID THE ITALIAN
EGYPTIANS OFTEN CAME TO BRINDISI AND TO HIM ONE NAME WAS PRETTY MUCH LIKE ANOTHER
ACCORDINGLY AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS WITH SIMON I WENDED MY WAY BACK TO THE HOUSE AGAIN
THEY WILL ALSO RECOGNIZE THE TWO SQUARES WHICH SIMON INDICATED IN HIS PLAN
THERE IS NO REASON WHY MISS STAGGLES AND MR VOLTAIRE MAY NOT WALK TOGETHER THERE'S MORE THAN SURMISE SUR
IT WAS NOW SATURDAY AND HE WOULD NOT RETURN UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT OR TUESDAY MORNING AND I MUST BE IN LONDON BY WEDNESDAY AT MIDNIGHT OR ALL WAS LOST
AT TWELVE O'CLOCK I SENT SIMON TO THE STATION WHILE I WENT TO THE LODGING-HOUSE TO AWAIT KAFFAR'S ARRIVAL
I WISH I COULD THINK OTHERWISE
I MUST BE AS CUNNING AS HE
EVIDENTLY HE REGARDED ME AS HIS RIVAL AND THUS HIS NATURAL ENEMY
I WENT UP-STAIRS TO MY ROOM WHICH YOU KNOW IS CLOSE TO MISS GRAY'S AND GERTRUDE'S
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY ARE IN THIS DIRECTION SHE SAID AT LENGTH
I DO NOT LOVE YOU I NEVER SHALL LOVE YOU
AT THE SMALLER OF THE TWO I FOUND ON INQUIRY THAT A MAN ANSWERING TO MY DESCRIPTION HAD STAYED THERE A DAY AND A NIGHT WAITING FOR THE BOAT FOR ALEXANDRIA
NOT A SINGLE PASSENGER WAS THERE WHILE THE TWO PORTERS WERE LOLLING LAZILY AROUND ENJOYING THE WARMTH OF THE BRIGHT MAY SUN
NOT A BIT ON IT SIR WAS THE REPLY
THUS FOUR DAYS WOULD SUFFICE FOR TRAVELLING AND I SHOULD HAVE MORE THAN THREE DAYS IN WHICH TO FIND KAFFAR
IT WAS TWISTED AND SOILED AND ON IT WERE SPOTS OF BLOOD
THEN MY STRENGTH BEGAN TO RETURN AND I AGAIN STOOD UP AND IN A FEW SECONDS I WAS MASTER OF MYSELF
MISS STAGGLES ALSO SAT NEAR AS GRIM AND TACITURN AS EVER
EACH DECLARED THAT THEY WERE ENTIRELY IGNORANT AS TO THE APPEARANCE OF THE GHOST AND ALL WERE EVIDENTLY TOO FRIGHTENED TO DOUBT THE TRUTH OF THEIR STATEMENT
BUT I STRUGGLED AGAINST IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH AND FOR A MINUTE I SEEMED TO GAIN THE MASTERY
A DOZEN TIMES I WAS BUOYED UP WITH HOPES A DOZEN TIMES MY HOPES WERE DESTROYED LEAVING ME MORE DESPAIRING THAN EVER
I WONDERED WHO COULD BE UP AT THAT TIME OF THE NIGHT BUT WAS NOT LEFT TO REMAIN LONG IN DOUBT MR VOLTAIRE SAID A VOICE YOU HAVE BEEN OUT LOOKING FOR MR BLAKE
AT THE SAME TIME I NOTICED THAT VOLTAIRE TOOK NOT THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE OF HER
WHAT MERCY DID HE HAVE UPON MY FRIEND
BUT YOUR DEFIANCE IS USELESS
HE'D CHARM A SERPIANT VITH THEWS PEEPERS O HISN AREN'T YOU AFRAID YOURSELF THEN HE CAN'T HURT ME FOR I'M TOO TOUGH AND I'M NOAN SIGHIN FOR ANYBODY I AIN'T
WHO'D A THOUGHT IT HE SAID MUSINGLY WHEN I HAD TOLD HIM
EVIDENTLY SHE WAS NOT ONE TO BE EASILY DECEIVED OR TRIFLED WITH
PRESENTLY I BEGAN TO CHIDE MYSELF FOR MY FOOLISHNESS
HIS PLOT WAS WELL WORKED OUT IN EVERY RESPECT
SHE HAD TOLD ME SHE LOVED ME--SHE WHOM HUNDREDS OF BRAVE MEN WOULD LOVE TO CALL THEIR OWN
FOR OF COURSE THEY WILL HAVE TO GO IN THE CARRIAGE AND I MUST GO WITH THEM
MY BRAIN SEEMED ON FIRE
I DID NOT CEASE READING UNTIL I HAD FINISHED WHAT I REGARDED THEN AND STILL REGARD AS ONE OF THE FINEST RELIGIOUS NOVELS OF THE AGE
WHEN THEY HAD GONE I SAID TO TOM I AM NOT GOING TO BED TO-NIGHT NO SAID TOM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS CRIED VOLTAIRE
I DID NOT KNOW WHO SPOKE BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE GERTRUDE FORREST'S VOICE
DID YOU NOT HEAR ME ASKING YOU TO AVOID HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM YES I SAID I AM SORRY
THEY MOVED ON FROM THE SPOT WHERE THEY HAD BEEN STANDING BUT I WAS TOO MUCH STUNNED TO FOLLOW THEM
BESIDES DID NOT THE LONGING FOR HIM GIVE EVIDENCE OF HIS BEING
WHAT COULD IT BE
THERE MIGHT BE NO HOTEL BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE KAFFAR STAYED IN A LODGING-HOUSE OR EVEN IN A PRIVATE HOUSE
WHAT WAS IT
IF THERE IS ANY SPECIES OF MANKIND THAT I DESPISE IT IS THAT OF A FLIRT A SOCIETY MAN A LADIES MAN AND HAVE I EVER GIVEN EVIDENCE OF BELONGING TO THAT CLASS MISS FORREST NO SHE REPLIED
AND A MAN DID NOT CONDUCT HER BUSINESS
BUT HOW'S IT TO BE DONE THEN I TOLD HIM OF MY INTERVIEW WITH THE PROFESSOR AND HOW HE HAD TOLD ME THAT ONLY HE--SIMON--COULD GIVE THE NECESSARY HELP
THERE WAS NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE THAT STRUCK ME DURING THE SERVICE SAVE THE READING OF ONE OF THE LESSONS
PERHAPS SHE AD A FEW WIRE PINS IN HER NATOMY
I THOUGHT OF THE WORDS I SHOULD SAY WHEN STOP I AM SURE I HEARD THAT WORD CLEAR AND DISTINCT
PARDON ME I REPLIED BUT I DECLINE TO ANSWER
YOU ARE HE SAID
JUSTIN THAT MAN TREMBLED LIKE A LEAF
THAT WILL DO I SAID TO THE PROFESSOR
I COULD NOT
I COULD NOT
EVERY ONE WATCHED BREATHLESSLY FOR WHAT WAS TO BE DONE OR SAID NEXT AND CERTAINLY I FELT THAT I WAS REGARDED BY THE GUESTS IN ANYTHING BUT A FAVOURABLE LIGHT
CLAPTRAP MORALITY IS NOTHING TO ME
YOU SHALL SEE HER ARRAYED FOR HER HUSBAND DRESSED ALL IN WHITE AS A BRIDE SHOULD BE
WHAT AFTER ALL WAS THE THOUGHT THAT MADDENED ME IF HE SHOULD BE LYING AT THE BOTTOM OF DREARWATER POND THERE WERE ONLY TWENTY-FOUR DAYS NOW
I HAVE NOT MERITED THE LADY'S DISPLEASURE STILL I THINK IT RIGHT IF YOU HAVE GROUNDS FOR SUSPECTING ANY ONE THAT WE SHOULD KNOW SAID A VOICE
IT'S A BAD HOUSE
MISS FORREST CRIED VOLTAIRE VEHEMENTLY YOU HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF YOUR REST TO-NIGHT IN ORDER TO KNOW ABOUT ONE WHO IS GUILTY OF WHAT YOU ENGLISH PEOPLE CALL A FOUL CRIME BUT WHICH I CALL A DEED THAT MUST BE AVENGED I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU AH
NEVER FELT BETTER
THEY ARE HEVIN A KIND OF CHRISTMAS-TREE IN ONE OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS OVER IN THE WILLAGE TO-NIGHT AND SOME O THE TEACHERS CAME TO THE GUV'NOR AND ASKED HIM FOR A TREE TO PUT SOME KNICK-KNACKS ON
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY WHAT YOU CALL THE VACCINATION DODGE I ASKED AFTER A SECOND'S SILENCE
SOME KAFFAR HAS TOLD ME ABOUT SOME I KNEW BEFORE
I WAS THE PLAYTHING THE TOOL OF A VILLAIN
IT'S A BIGGISH PLACE IT IS AND I CAN'T SEE NO NAME
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN CRIED VOLTAIRE
TO REALIZE MY LIFE A SIMILAR CONDITION MUST BE EXPERIENCED
HE CALLS EVERYTHING MYSTERIOUS BY THAT NAME I SAID
I WAS SITTING IN MY ROOM ANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR THE CONTINENTAL MAIL AND ANY TELEGRAMS WHICH MIGHT ARRIVE
I CONFESS HE WENT ON THAT MY HEART BEGAN TO BEAT QUICKLY AT THESE WORDS
DON'T LOITER SO
WE ARE ALL FRIENDS HERE SAID TOM AND I THOUGHT I DETECTED AN AMOUNT OF ANXIETY IN HIS VOICE
WHAT IS THAT IN YOUR HAND I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
THEN WHEN EXCITEMENT WAS AT THE HIGHEST HE WOKE UP AND COOLLY RUBBED HIS EYES
STILL THERE IS A MEANS OF VENGEANCE
YOU MUST NOT BE LATER THAN NINE O'CLOCK SHE SAID WITH A GLAD LAUGH WHILE MY HEART SEEMED READY TO BREAK FOR JOY
SCARCELY HAD THE FORMALITIES OF INTRODUCTION BEEN GONE THROUGH BETWEEN THE EGYPTIAN AND MYSELF WHEN MY EYES WERE DRAWN TO THE DOOR WHICH WAS AGAIN OPENING
IF THE LATTER HOWEVER I DETERMINED TO GIVE UP MY LIFE FOR MISS FORREST TO PUT MYSELF IN THE HANDS OF THE POLICE AUTHORITIES AND TELL OF THE INFLUENCE VOLTAIRE HAD EXERTED OVER ME
MR VOLTAIRE USED THE WORD IMAGINATION IN HIS STORY I REPLIED AND I THINK IT WOULD DESCRIBE IT VERY WELL
DID HE STAY AT HOME DURING THE DAY
THERE ARE SUBJECTS RELATING TO THE HUMAN BODY MIND AND SOUL WHICH CANNOT BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN REALLY STUDIED AT ALL EXCEPT BY SOME RECLUSE HERE AND THERE WHO IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED MAD
WELL SUR IN TWO MONTHS MORE I WERE DOWN WI SMALL-POX AND WHEN I GOT UP AGAIN I WUR A SIGHT TO BEHOLD
AND WHERE IS KAFFAR SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZED AS VOLTAIRE'S
BUT FOR HIM PERHAPS I SHOULD NEVER HAVE THE TREASURE I NOW POSSESS THE TRUEST AND NOBLEST WIFE GOD EVER GAVE TO MAN
I PROMISED GERTRUDE TO EXERT MYSELF TO FIND KAFFAR TO SET HER FREE FROM HER PROMISE TO VOLTAIRE
EVIL POWERS WERE TRIUMPHANT
THE VOYAGE WAS NOT LONG NEITHER WAS IT VERY TEDIOUS
WELL I SAID WHEN THEY WERE GONE
SAY JUSTIN MY BOY HE SAID WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A GALLOP OF FOUR WHO ARE THE FOUR I ASKED
I WOULD HURL FROM ME THE INCUBUS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE CRUSH ME
BUT MIGHT NOT I HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY THE PROFESSOR
SHE HAS A LARGE ESTATE AND A GRAND COUNTRY MANSION IN THE SOUTH OF THIS COUNTRY
FOR YOUR SAKE SAID VOLTAIRE--'FOR YOUR SAKE I COULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING
HE EVIDENTLY HAD A MESSAGE FOR ME FOR MAKING A SIGN FOR ME TO STOP HE QUICKLY CAME TO MY SIDE
I WANTED TO GET RID OF AN AWFUL WEIGHT WHICH OPPRESSED ME
A MIDNIGHT CONFERENCE XIII
EVERY TIME I BEGAN TO SPEAK OF THE INFLUENCE VOLTAIRE HAD EXERTED I WAS SEEMINGLY TONGUE-TIED
IF EVER YOU SEEK TO WALK WITH HER I WILL DRAG YOU AWAY FROM HER
IS HE NOT A WONDERFUL MAN YES I SAID ABSENTLY
AND DID I SPARE HIM
VOLTAIRE AND KAFFAR WERE BOTH THERE BUT THEY UTTERED NO WORD
IF I WOULD POSSESS THE POWER OF GOD IN ME I MUST SUBMIT MYSELF WHOLLY AND UNRESERVEDLY TO HIM
ACCORDINGLY I TOLD THE GOOD LADY THAT I SHOULD NOT TAKE LODGINGS THERE AND IF I TOOK APARTMENTS IN ANY PLACE IN THE CITY HERS SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST CONSIDERATION
WILL HE LET YOU KNOW WHEN HE IS COMING BACK YES
VOLTAIRE I SAID IS THIS QUITE FAIR NO NO HE CRIED
AND SO WITH HER WARM KISS BURNING ON MY LIPS I HURRIED OFF TO THE GREAT METROPOLIS WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE IDEA WHY I WAS GOING
MORE THAN THAT THE CALAMITIES I DREADED DID NOT TAKE PLACE BUT THE ABSENCE OF THOSE CALAMITIES BROUGHT ME NO SATISFACTION
MISS STAGGLES GOT TIRED AFTER AWHILE AND SO THERE WAS RELIEF IN THAT QUARTER WHILE MY SEAT WAS MOST COMFORTABLE AND I DID NOT WANT TO BE DISTURBED
HE LOOKED VERY GRAVE VERY WORRIED
MY NAME MENTIONED WITH LOATHING
AND YET I WAS SURE SIMON WOULD NOT BE A PARTY IN DECEIVING ME
BUT THAT WILL DROP OUT VERY SOON
THAT IS MY PROFESSION SAID THE LITTLE MAN THEN I AM IN HOPES THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO HELP ME IN MY DIFFICULTY I SHALL BE PLEASED TO HELP YOU HE SAID STILL STIFFLY
SHE LOOKS CURIOUSLY ROUND AND THEN I SEE HER MAKE STRAIGHT FOR YOUR BEDROOM DOOR AND GOES INTO YOUR ROOM
BUT YOU SHALL NOT COME HERE TO POLLUTE THE AIR BY YOUR PRESENCE
SHE WAS
BUT MYSTERIES ARE SOMETIMES OF HUMAN ORIGIN AS HE SAID THIS HE LEERED UP INTO MY FACE AS IF TO READ MY THOUGHTS
YOU KNOW THE PLANTATION UP BEHIND THE HOUSE MR BLAKE THE FIR PLANTATION
IT'S A JUNCTION WHERE SOME GO TO CATCH THE NIGHT EXPRESS TO LEEDS
I FELT MY GERTRUDE'S LIPS AGAINST MINE
DID HE GIVE HIS NAME HEROD VOLTAIRE VOLTAIRE
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT MR KAFFAR MEANS I REPLIED
YES I SAY THIS HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF MY FRIEND TEMPLE
TAKE HEART MY FRIEND
YOU HAVE INQUIRED ABOUT HER SAID A VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZED AS BELONGING TO VOLTAIRE
SIMON WAS AGAIN IN A MESMERIC SLEEP OR WHATEVER THE READER MAY BE PLEASED TO CALL IT IN A FEW SECONDS AFTER HE HAD SAT DOWN
THE SUSPENSE WAS BECOMING TERRIBLE
I WAS GETTING TERRIBLY ANXIOUS NOW
YES SIR HE SAID I DO REMEMBER SUCH A CHAP
HE SMILED AS HE LOOKED AT IT WHILE I TOOK MY HAT AND STATED MY INTENTION TO START FOR TURIN AT ONCE
WHERE IS KAFFAR NOW IS IT TRUE I REMEMBER SAYING
SIMON HEAVED A DEEP SIGH AND PEERED WEARILY AROUND WHILE THE PROFESSOR KEPT HIS EYE STEADILY UPON HIM
STILL I FOUND SOME RELICS OF THE WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS
BUT I MUST HAVE A GOOD PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM
BUT I AM CHAINED ON EVERY HAND BUT YOU ARE GOING TO BREAK THOSE CHAINS
STRANGE NOISES FILLED THE AIR
I REFUSED TO TAKE NOTICE OF MRS TEMPLE'S WARNING GLANCE
I WANT TO WACCINATE YOU GAINST CHOLERA HOOPIN COUGH AND SMALL-POX SAYS HE
I WAS IN THE DOCTOR'S SERVICE AS WACCINATED ME
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS
I DEFY YOU TO UTTER ONE WORD AGAIN I WAS SILENT
THUS WHEN EVENING CAME NOTHING WAS KNOWN OF IT
IT HAD NOT FINISHED WHEN SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
ON ARRIVING WE WERE IMMEDIATELY SHOWN IN AND THE LITTLE MAN SOON MADE HIS APPEARANCE
MY FAITH IN GOD HAD GIVEN ME LIFE AND SO I WOULD DARE TO DEFY THE WRETCH
NO NO
NO NO
WHAT WAS IT MR TEMPLE?--A RED HAND APPEARS FROM THE WATER AND WHOEVER SEES IT WILL BE LED TO COMMIT MURDER OH THERE ARE DOZENS OF STORIES ABOUT THE PLACE SAID TOM
AND YET AS WE GALLOPED ON MY HEART BEAT RIGHT JOYFULLY
AROUND ME WAS A STRETCH OF COMMON LAND ON WHICH GREW HEATHER AND FURZE
SOME OF THE YOUNG LADIES SIMPERED OTHERS WERE FRANK SOME WERE FAIRLY GOOD LOOKING WHILE OTHERS WERE OTHERWISE AND THAT IS ABOUT ALL THAT COULD BE SAID
SURELY SHE NEED NOT BE AGITATED AT MEETING ME UNLESS SHE TOOK A SPECIAL INTEREST IN ME--UNLESS INDEED SHE FELT AS I FELT
THAT IS VERY CONVENIENT FOR ONE WHO HAS STATED HIS BELIEFS SO DOGGEDLY
I SPOKE NOT A WORD HOWEVER
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME SHE SAID THIS FRANKLY AND WITHOUT HESITATION
SIMON DID HIS BEST TO CHEER ME WHILE KAFFAR FURTIVELY WATCHED US BOTH AS IF IN FEAR
I ACCUSED HIM OF MANY THINGS BUT HE DENIED NOTHING DENIED NOTHING NOTHING MISS FORREST
EVIDENTLY THEY HAD FASTENED THEIR HORSES IN THE NEAR DISTANCE AND WERE NOW SEEKING TO BETTER ENJOY THEMSELVES BY WALKING
THE TEMPLE VANISHED AND WITH IT ALL MY REALIZATION OF LIFE SAVE A VAGUE FANCY THAT I WAS MOVING SOMEWHERE I KNEW NOT WHERE
WHAT A FOOL I'VE BEEN
DON'T KILL ME
I KNOW I MAY NOT BE ACTING ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT USAGES OF SOCIETY BUT THAT DOES NOT TROUBLE ME A LITTLE BIT ACCORDINGLY WITH THE UTMOST GOOD TASTE SHE INTRODUCED ME TO A NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN INVITED
WELL BUT TWILL BE GRAND IF WE CAN FIND IM YER HONOUR WON'T IT THEN I SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT HARASSED BY A THOUSAND DOUBTS AND FEARS
GO ON MRS RICHARDS
WELL IT'S WELL TO BE STRONG AND ABLE TO BEAR FATIGUE
THAT IS ALL
I HAD THOUGHT OF GOING BACK BY DIEPPE AND NEWHAVEN
BUT I DARED NOT RISK HIM OUT OF MY SIGHT SO WE GOT INTO A RUMBLING OLD FOUR-WHEELER AND I OFFERED THE CABBY A SOVEREIGN IF HE WOULD GET ME AT THE ADDRESS I GAVE HIM IN HALF-AN-HOUR
AND I THINK I CAN GUESS WHO'S WORKING IT SIMON STARTED
YOU ARE A PROFESSOR OF MESMERISM AND CLAIRVOYANCE I BELIEVE I BEGAN
SHALL YOU GO SHE ASKED
SOMETIMES WAILING SOUNDS WERE WAFTED TO ME WHICH PRESENTLY CHANGED INTO HISSES UNTIL IT SEEMED AS IF A THOUSAND SERPENTS WERE CREEPING ALL AROUND ME
STILL TO BLIGE THE COMPANY I'LL DO OWT RAISONABLE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT DID SIMON SAID TOM TURNING TO THAT WORTHY AFTER IT LIFTED ITS KNIFE IN THE AIR SHE WENT AWAY WITH A WAIL LIKE SAID SIMON SLOWLY
THERE THE SKIES ARE BRIGHT THE TREES ARE ALWAYS GREEN
I WAS NOW MAKING MY GREAT MOVE
I BLUSHED ALMOST GUILTILY AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE--I WHO HAD FOR YEARS DECLARED THAT NO WOMAN COULD INTEREST ME ENOUGH TO MAKE MY HEART THROB ONE WHIT THE QUICKER
YOU SHALL GO WITH ME HALF-AN-HOUR LATER WE WERE AT GOWER STREET MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR OUR JOURNEY TO TURIN--SIMON CALM AND COLLECTED I FEVERISH AND EXCITED
KAFFAR WOULD IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ATTRACT ATTENTION IN A COUNTRY PLACE
MOREOVER DR MACDONALD SHOWS WHAT ENORMOUS POWER FOR EVIL OR FOR GOOD MAY BE EXERTED BY IT
WELL YOU'LL SEE WHAT YOU GET BY DEFYING ME
YOU MUST BE SWEPT OUT OF THE WAY AND THEN AS I TOLD YOU I WILL TAKE THIS DAINTY DUCK FROM YOU I WILL PRESS HER ROSY LIPS TO MINE AND STOP I CRIED
IN MY OPINION SUR SHE'S A WITCH SHE IS AND HEV GOT DEALIN'S WITH THE DEVIL AND WHAT FOR ALL THIS I SAID
PROMISE ME NO WORD SHALL BE UTTERED AS TO THIS
NO YOU ARE WRONG
I HAD NO PANGS OF CONSCIENCE NO FEELING OF REMORSE AND YET THE THOUGHT THAT I HAD HURRIED A MAN INTO ETERNITY WAS HORRIBLE
INSTANTLY THE EYES OF HELFA BEGAN TO CLOSE
IT WAS TO BE A FIGHT TO THE DEATH BETWEEN ME AND THIS MAN IF I WOULD OBTAIN THE WOMAN I LOVED
A MESSAGE JIST A COME YER HONOUR HE CRIED
AND WHEN THE MORNING CAME AND WE ALL TRIED TO LAUGH AT THE GHOST I FELT THAT THERE WAS A DEEP SINISTER MEANING IN IT ALL AND WONDERED WHAT THE END WOULD BE
KAFFAR IS AT TORINO IS HE SAID THE PROFESSOR
AND I HAIN'T A GOT A GOOD-LOOKIN JIB AND BUT HERE VOLTAIRE ENTERED THE ROOM AND SPOKE TO TOM TEMPLE
FORGIVE ME IF I DO
HE WAS NOT REMEMBERED IN THE CUSTOM HOUSE
I WASTED NO TIME
I PLACED A CHAIR FOR HER BESIDE MY OWN WHICH SHE ACCEPTED WITHOUT A WORD
DISAPPOINTING JUSTIN MY BOY HE SAID
WE HAD NOT WAITED ABOVE THREE MINUTES WHEN I KNEW THAT THE ROOM WAS PEOPLED--BY WHOM I KNEW NOT EXCEPT THAT THEY CAME FROM THAT LAND FROM WHOSE BOURNE YOUR GREATEST POET SAYS NO TRAVELLER RETURNS I LOOKED AT ABOU
BESIDES EVEN IF I GOT SUCH A POWER I COULD NOT USE IT
AND YET I WAS LIVING A DUAL LIFE
IS THAT ALL SIMON ALL YER HONOUR
KAFFAR WAS NOT ONE THAT COULD BE LOVED BY YOU COLD PEOPLE
I NATURALLY THOUGHT HE WOULD RETURN TO HIS NATIVE LAND BECAUSE I HAD HEARD HIM SAY HE TALKED NONE OF THE EUROPEAN LANGUAGES BESIDES ENGLISH AND A SMATTERING OF TURKISH
HE AIN'T NO ORDINARY MAN
I SAW THEM ON THE CONTINENT INDEED I SAID WHILE I HAVE NO DOUBT A DARK LOOK PASSED OVER MY FACE
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE ORDINARY ENGLISH EDUCATION AND WHAT DOES IT AMOUNT TO
SHE WAS EVER SEEKING TO SERVE HIM THEN
I LOVE THE VERY GROUND ON WHICH YOU WALK
BUT WHAT THEN I ASKED MR BLAKE QUESTIONS
I HAVE NOTHING THAT I WOULD KEEP SECRET FROM YOU AND YET I CANNOT TELL YOU THAT WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW DID SHE UNDERSTAND ME
I USED TO THINK AFTER THAT WACCINATIN BUSINESS GIVED ME SMALL-POX THAT I WAS DONE FOR
I FOUND IT STIFF ENOUGH NOT SO STIFF WHEN IT CAN BE TAKEN AT YOUR AGE REPLIED VOLTAIRE
SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT OUT
SON HEROD HE SAID PREPARE TO SEE THE GREATEST DEED EVER DONE BY MAN
BUT THAT STORY OF YOUR WALKING FIVE MILES ALONE RATHER THAN RIDE IN A CARRIAGE WITH SOME LADIES HAS CONVINCED HER
AGAIN SIMON SUBMITTED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE LITTLE MAN AND SOON ANSWERED HIS QUESTIONS FAR MORE READILY THAN HE HAD HITHERTO DONE
YOUR FRIEND IS ALIVE
I AM THINKING WHETHER IT IS FAIR TO HER TO TELL YOU AND YET IT IS RIGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT WAS IT TOM SHE THREW HERSELF DOWN ON HER KNEES BEFORE US AND BESOUGHT US TO KEEP THE MATTER IN OUR OWN HEARTS
WHILE THEY WERE CONVERSING I WENT ACROSS THE ROOM AND SPOKE TO MISS FORREST
OUR EMBARRASSMENT CAME TO AN END JUST THEN FOR SEVERAL OTHERS CAME INTO THE ROOM AND THE CONVERSATION BECAME GENERAL
YOU SEE AND THE ITALIAN PUT HIS FACE CLOSE TO MINE
THEN HE TURNED TO MISS FORREST AND SPOKE AS COOLLY AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE HAPPENED THROUGH THE DAY EXCEPT AN INQUIRY WHICH TOM MADE AMONG THE SERVANTS
IT SEEMS TERRIBLY REAL AND I HAVE HEARD OF SUCH STRANGE THINGS BUT YOU ARE NOT AFRAID
WIRE BACK IMMEDIATELY THE TIME I MAY EXPECT HIM ANXIOUSLY I WAITED FOR AN ANSWER
I AM RELATING THIS VERY BADLY JUSTIN
HE HAS GONE BEYOND THE ELEMENTS OF OUR PROFESSION
I'VE PLAYED A GHOST MYSELF IN A THEATRE AND I COULD NEVER GIT UP LIKE YOU DID THE OTHER NIGHT ME GET UP AS A GHOST SHE SCREAMED
SHE HAD BEEN BEAUTIFUL IN LIFE BUT WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL IN DEATH AND IT WAS WITH REVERENCE FOR THAT BEAUTY THAT I STOOD BESIDE HER
THEY BE A BOOTIFUL COUPLE YER HONOUR HE LOOKED AROUND AGAIN AND THEN SAID THAT MURDERIN WACCINATIN WILLAIN IS GONE EFTER EM MR BLAKE
I HAD FALLEN IN LOVE I HAD MADE AN ENEMY AND I HAD MATCHED MYSELF AGAINST MEN WHO POSSESSED A KNOWLEDGE OF SOME OF THE SECRET FORCES OF LIFE WITHOUT EVER CALCULATING MY OWN STRENGTH
BUT WHEN ONCE ALONE IN MY ROOMS NOTHING BUT A FEELING OF UTTER DESOLATION POSSESSED MY HEART
I WAS SO SORRY YOU ALLOWED YOURSELF TO BE PLACED UNDER HIS INFLUENCE LAST NIGHT
A MINUTE MORE AND SIMON ENTERED CAREFULLY LEADING KAFFAR
WHAT DO YOU SAY
BY THE WAY TOM I SAID AFTER ANOTHER SHORT SILENCE HAVE YOU FOUND OUT ANYTHING IN RELATION TO THE GHOST WHICH APPEARED HERE DURING MY VISIT NOTHING DEFINITE
SIMON LOOKED AROUND TO MAKE SURE THERE WERE NO EAVESDROPPERS
AN THEN I TRIED TO GO TO THE DOOR AND WHEN I GOT THERE THERE WAS NOTHIN THAT IS YOU LOOKED INTO THE PASSAGE SIMON NODDED
ARE THEY IN YOUR IDEA NO SCIENCES IN REALITY PARDON ME MR VOLTAIRE I REPLIED BUT I AM AN ENGLISHMAN
NAY YOU CANNOT
EVIDENTLY HE HAD FAILED IN HIS DESIGN AND FOR THE TIME AT ALL EVENTS HAD ABANDONED IT
I CAN ONLY WORK THROUGH CERTAIN LAWS WHICH I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH EITHER TO RECOGNIZE OR DISCOVER
I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS SO FAR GONE A VOICE SAID
HE SEEMED TO BE PONDERING SOME MATTER IN HIS MIND AND APPEARED IRRESOLUTE AS TO WHAT ACTION HE SHOULD TAKE
AND HOW LONG WE STOPPED AT THE LITTLE ROADSIDE STATIONS
FOR A WHILE WE CHATTED ON ORDINARY SUBJECTS AND THEN REMOUNTING OUR HORSES WE PREPARED TO RIDE BACK
THE SECOND CHRISTMAS EVE CHAPTER I INTRODUCES THE WRITER AND OTHERS MY STORY BEGINS ON THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 18 18 WHILE SITTING AT BREAKFAST
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT JUSTIN?"--TURNING TO ME
KAFFAR WOULD GET MONEY BY GAMBLING
IT WAS BUT LITTLE MORE THAN A THIRTY HOURS RIDE TO TURIN--THAT IS PROVIDING EVERYTHING WENT SMOOTHLY
MOREOVER I WILL HAVE NO SECRETS FROM YOU EVEN WITH REGARD TO THE SUBJECT ITSELF
YOU ARE GOOD AT ALL SORTS OF ODD GAMES
BY AND BY HOWEVER I HEARD A VOICE
BOTH ABOU AND I WERE GLAD AT HEART
I IMMEDIATELY RETRACED MY STEPS TO THE HOUSE WHERE MEETING TOM I ASKED HIM TO LET ME HAVE SIMON SLOWDEN AND A COUPLE OF DOGS AS I WANTED TO SHOOT A FEW RABBITS
THANK GOD STOP YOUR PIOUS EXCLAMATIONS HE SAID
THUS I UNDERSTOOD THE EGYPTIAN'S REPLY
ONCE WITH HER ALL MY DREADS AND FEARS VANISHED
SMALL DARK AND WIRY SPEAKING WITH AN ACCENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS I SAID TRYING TO IMITATE KAFFAR
YOU ARE NOT A-GWINE TO WACCINATE ME BE EE SAID SIMON AT LENGTH
GOD BLESS YOU SHE WENT AWAY THEN AND LEFT ME
I'D RATHER HAVE SMALL-POX A DOZEN TIMES THAN YOU SHOULD BE KNOCKED OVERBOARD BY SICH AS HE I WAS NOTHING LOTH AND SO ALTHOUGH IT WAS STILL EARLY WE WERE SOON IN A CAB ON OUR WAY TO THE PROFESSOR'S
I DID NOT REPLY EXCEPT BY A SMILE WHICH THIS ITALIAN MAIDEN EVIDENTLY TOOK FOR AN ASSENT TO HER MOTHER'S PROPOSITION AND ACCORDINGLY PROCEEDED TO MAKE SOME CIGARETTES FOR ME
I HAD SCARCELY REACHED THE PARK GATES HOWEVER WHEN A HAND TOUCHED ME
SHE HAD YELLOW WRINKLED SKIN A SQUARE UPRIGHT FOREHEAD SHAGGY GREY EYEBROWS BENEATH WHICH IN TWO CAVERNOUS SOCKETS WERE TWO BLACK BEADY-LOOKING EYES
I DO NOT WISH TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM I SAID AND MIGHT I ALSO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU
VON VIRCHOW BEGAN BY ASKING THE SAME QUESTION HE HAD ASKED IN THE MORNING
AH WELL SUCH IS THE FATE OF THAT COMMUNITY CALLED COUNTRY GENTLEMEN BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO WRITE ABOUT AND I AM GOING STRAIGHT TO THE REAL OBJECT OF THIS LETTER
SOME SERVANT WALKING IN HER SLEEP NO SIR SAID MRS RICHARDS IN AWFUL TONES
BUT MY BRAIN WAS CONFUSED AND I COULD NOT RID MYSELF FROM THE IDEA THAT SOME PLOT WAS BEING CONCOCTED AGAINST ME
ONE AS I SHUDD'N LIKE MUCH TO DO WI AND WHERE DID HE BOOK FOR DINGLEDALE JUNCTION SIR AND HE WOULD BE ABLE TO CATCH A TRAIN FROM THERE HE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FOR THE EXPRESS TO LEEDS REPLIED THE MAN
WAS NOT THE CREATION OF CERVANTES BRAIN ABOUT AS SENSIBLE AS I
IT SHOULD BE DONE EASILY
THANK YOU MR TEMPLE WITH THIS TOM TEMPLE COMPLETELY BLINDFOLDED THE EGYPTIAN AND THEN WE AWAITED THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE MATTER
I DID THIS FOR TWO REASONS BESIDES MY PRINCIPLES OF ABSTINENCE
ONE THING WAS IN MY FAVOUR
HE APPEARED IN A DEEP SLEEP
I DID NOT INTEND TO BE OFFENSIVE I SAID
NO ONE UTTERED A WORD WE WERE ALL TOO MUCH AMAZED
YOU WILL COME TO THE WEDDING MR BLAKE
BUT I GOVERNED MY FEATURES PRETTY WELL AND THUS I THINK DECEIVED HIM
WE SHALL NOT GET BACK IN TIME FOR DINNER IF YOU DO IT WAS TOM TEMPLE WHO SPOKE AND A TURN IN THE LANE REVEALED HIM
SCUSE ME YER HONOUR BUT SINCE THAT DOCTOR WACCINATED ME AND NEARLY KILLED ME BY IT TOUGH AS I BE I COME TO CALL ALL TOMFOOLERY BY THE SAME NAME
WHAT MUST I DO
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN HE ASKED ANGRILY
FOR SHE KNEW ANTIDOTES FOR EVERY POISON
I AM AN OLD FRIEND OF MISS FORREST'S I SAID TO THE MAN
I COULD RECORD TO YOU FACTS THAT ARE STRANGE BEYOND THE IMAGINATION OF DUMAS
YOU SEE I HAVE LIVED SO LONG IN THE EAST THAT I HAVE LOST MUCH OF MY EUROPEAN TRAINING
THIS WAS ALL
THEN SAID VOLTAIRE I WILL LEAVE YOU
BUT MUCH MIGHT BE DONE EVEN YET
NO ONE HAS HAD A CHANCE OF KNOWING TOM STOPPED IN HIS RECITAL AS IF HE WOULD RATHER NOT TELL WHAT FOLLOWED
WHAT HAD BECOME OF MY TWO TRAVELLING COMPANIONS I WAS NOT AWARE BUT CONCLUDED THAT THEY WOULD BE STAYING AT LEEDS AS THEY HAD GIVEN UP THEIR TICKETS AT THE COLLECTING STATION
WHY ARE THEY PLOTTING AGAINST YOU BECAUSE VOLTAIRE KNOWS THAT I LOVE WITH ALL MY SOUL THE WOMAN HE WANTS TO WIN FOR HIS WIFE A CURIOUS LOOK SHOT ACROSS HER FACE
I CANNOT CALL TO MIND ALL THE GESTURES THE TONES OF VOICE OR THE AWFUL ANGUISH WHICH SEEMED TO POSSESS THEM BOTH
AFTER DINNER THIS BEING NEW YEAR'S DAY WE PASSED A MORE THAN USUALLY MERRY TIME
AH REMEMBER THIS MORNING
NEVER
NEVER
BE PATIENT
I TRIED TO RESIST THE INFLUENCE THAT WAS DRAWING ME OUT OF THE ROOM BUT I COULD NOT
I AM SURE YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO VINDICATE AND PROVE ANY ASSERTION I HAVE MADE
YOU GO INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED AND I'LL TAKE HIM QUIETLY UP-STAIRS TO BED I ENTERED THE SILENT HOUSE LIKE ONE IN A DREAM AND WENT WITH TOM TO MY BEDROOM WHERE I UNDRESSED LIKE A WEARY CHILD AND SOON SUNK INTO A DEEP DREAMLESS SLEEP
CHAPTER XIV GOD FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS I WAS AN ATHEIST
I AM AFRAID IT SAYS VERY LITTLE FOR OUR EDUCATION I REPLIED
AFTERWARDS VII
SOME POWER OF OBSTINACY SEEMED TO POSSESS ME
IT REALLY IS
SHE LOOKED LIKE A WOODEN FIGGER WITHOUT PROPER J'INTS
I WILL CLOSE MY STORY WITH A SECRET
ENGLISH LAW IS HARD ON MURDERERS BUT ALL EVIDENCE IS PUT THROUGH A VERY FINE SIEVE IN AN ENGLISH COURT OF JUSTICE
WE HAD NOW FIVE HOURS TO GET TO KENSINGTON
I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT SHOULD SAVE THAT SOME OF THE YOUNG LADIES WERE FRIGHTENED AND ACCEPTED THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY WHEREBY THEY COULD IN SOME WAY RELIEVE THEIR FEELINGS
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WAS MUCH AGAINST ME
BUT WHEN I REMEMBER THE INFLUENCE IT HAD ON MY LIFE I FEEL INCLINED TO HOLD TO MY OPINION
THE WEATHER LOOKS FROSTY AND THAT PROMISES SKATING
I COULD FOREGO ANYTHING FOR YOU
I THOUGHT YOU HAD FOUND OUT BEFORE THIS THAT I WAS NOT THE MAN EITHER TO BE DISOBEYED OR TRIFLED WITH I DID NOT THINK IT WISE TO SPEAK
IF I COULD FIND THIS MAN I SHOULD BE REWARDED A THOUSANDFOLD
SHE SAID YES BEFORE I HAD STUTTERED OUT MY LITTLE SPEECH I COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE YOU IN SUCH AN AGONY OF PAIN BLUSHINGLY REPLIED HIS HAPPY LITTLE WIFE
YOU KNOW I WILL SHE SAYS
BUT FOR HIM I MIGHT HAVE DRAGGED OUT MY WEARY LIFE DISAPPOINTED AND ALMOST BROKEN-HEARTED
I MUST MAKE A SORT OF APOLOGY TOO HE WENT ON
IF HE IS ALIVE HE SHALL BE FOUND AND I WILL BRING HIM BACK AND SHE SHALL SEE HIM AH YES
THE READER MAY SMILE AS HE OR SHE READS THIS BUT THIS IS TRUE
NO HE'S NOT SAFE SAID VOLTAIRE AND HE SHALL PAY FOR THIS WITH HIS LIFE IS IT MANLY I SAID TO HIM TO PERSECUTE A LADY THUS
I CAN'T MAKE EM OUT WHAT DO YOU SEE NOW SAID THE PROFESSOR TOUCHING HIS FOREHEAD
TIME AFTER TIME BY SOME SUBTLE QUESTION HE SOUGHT TO LEAD ME TO SPEAK ABOUT THE WOMAN DEAR TO MY HEART BUT IN THAT HE DID NOT SUCCEED
I DO NOT THINK IT RIGHT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT MY LODGERS SAID THE MAN SHARPLY
IN FRONT OF ME WERE NOISELESS WATERS A DISMAL SIGHT AT THE BEST OF TIMES BUT AWFUL AS I SAW THEM
HOWEVER I DID NOT STAY HERE
HOWEVER IT IS PERHAPS SCARCELY FAIR TO TALK ABOUT HIM THUS ALL THIS TIME WE HAD STOOD LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW UPON THE WINTRY LANDSCAPE AND I AT LEAST WAS OBLIVIOUS TO ALL ELSE BUT THE FACT THAT I WAS TALKING WITH THE WOMAN WHOSE INTEREST FOR ME WAS PARAMOUNT WHEN A LUMP OF COAL FELL FROM THE GRATE UPON THE FIRE-IRONS
I COULD NEVER FIND HIM
YOU AND HE'S GOT YOUR PEEPERS FIXED IN THE SAME PLACE AND SCUSE ME
TO STOP SUCH AN EVENT I WOULD DEVOTE MY LIFE
I COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK OF IT
AFTER THAT HE COULD SEE ME ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH HIS PROFESSION
THE SECRETS OF MIND AND SPIRIT ARE LEFT UNNOTICED BY YOU WESTERN PEOPLE
AND SECOND THE WEATHER WAS SO BAD THAT TO STATE TIMES OF ARRIVAL WAS IMPOSSIBLE
THE LODGERS ARE BAD MEN AND THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE SHE SAID THIS EVIDENTLY IN EARNEST WHILE THE LITTLE GIRL BEHIND THE COUNTER HOPED I SHOULD NOT GO AMONG THOSE THIEVES
IF IT IS I AM GLAD I AM NOT AN ENGLISHMAN WITH THIS HE FIXED HIS EYES STEADILY ON ME AND TRIED TO FASTEN MY ATTENTION BUT DID NOT AT THE TIME SUCCEED
AT LENGTH SHE TURNED TO HIM AGAIN CONTINUED TOM
DO YOU NOT LIKE THEM SHE ASKED
HE DID NOT SPEAK BUT WINKED SLYLY AT ME AND THEN LED THE HORSE AWAY FROM THE STABLE-YARD
WELL SHE REPLIED LOOKING SHYLY INTO MY FACE
YOU MUST GIVE UP ALL THOUGHTS ALL HOPES ALL DESIGNS OF EVER WINNING GERTRUDE FORREST FOR YOUR WIFE AND IF I REFUSE IF YOU REFUSE I SHALL HAVE TO MAKE YOU DO WHAT I WOULD RATHER YOU WOULD DO WILLINGLY
WAS KAFFAR IN TURIN
IT IS A QUEER NAME THOUGH AIN'T IT WELL WHAT NOW WHY HE'S IN THE TRAIN AND IT'S STARTED IT IS DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING NO BUT HE HAS A TICKET
IN MY JOY I HAD FORGOTTEN MY DETERMINATION BUT NOW I QUICKLY MADE MY WAY TO THE SUMMER-HOUSE THAT STOOD IN THE DARK FIR PLANTATION
COWARD I SAID YOU SOUGHT TO TAKE ME UNAWARES
YES I REMEMBERED THE ADDRESS FOR I HAD SEEN IT ONLY THE DAY BEFORE SO I TOLD THE CABMAN TO DRIVE TO
IT'S A RAILWAY STATION AND I SEE THAT ERE WILLAIN THERE JEST AS CUNNIN AS EVER
AND YET I DARED NOT RISE FROM MY CHAINS AND SEE WHETHER THE THINGS I HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF DOING WERE TRUE
EARTH AND HEAVEN ARE FULL OF OCCULT FORCES I PAID NO FURTHER ATTENTION TO THE SUBJECT AT THE TIME BUT THIS CONVERSATION CAME BACK TO ME WITH TERRIBLE FORCE IN THE AFTER-DAYS
I HAD RECEIVED NO MESSAGE FROM THE LODGING-HOUSE KEEPER NEITHER HAD I HEARD ANY NEWS
YOU SEE HIS POWER OF RESISTANCE IS VERY GREAT AND IT NEEDED FOUR TIMES THE MAGNETISM TO BRING HIM UNDER THAT IT DID YOUR SERVANT I'M SORRY YOU EXPERIMENTED ON HIM AT ALL SAID ANOTHER VOICE
MANY OF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN WHAT WILL BE THE VERY MARROW OF MY STORY COME VOLTAIRE NEVER MIND APOLOGIES SAID TOM TEMPLE
HER LIGHT EYES AND MERRY LAUGH DROVE AWAY DULL CARE AND SOON I WAS IN PARADISE
HE DID NOT SPEAK--HE ONLY LOOKED
BUT IF I FOUND THE EGYPTIAN
THE MATTER WAS STILL ENSHROUDED IN MYSTERY BUT STILL I THOUGHT I HAD FOUND A POSSIBLE SOLUTION
WILL YOU COME HERE AT THREE O'CLOCK YES I SAID WONDERING WHAT SHE MEANT
HER SOUL HAD OUTSOARED THAT OF HER FATHER AND OF ALL THE SAGES FOR MANY MILES AROUND AND SHE WOULD HAVE REVEALED HER KNOWLEDGE BOTH TO HER FATHER AND TO ME BUT FOR ONE THING
I FELT SURE I HAD MADE ONE STEP FORWARD
DID I KILL HIM
AN IDEA FLASHED INTO MY MIND
WERE NOT MY THOUGHTS CONCERNING VOLTAIRE'S SCHEMES ABOUT MISS FORREST ALL FANCY
KAFFAR WAS NEVER SEEN WELL THEN IF YOU ARE SO SURE GIVE ME IN CHARGE
THE WIND HAD GONE TO REST THE MOON SHONE DIMLY FROM BEHIND THE MISTY CLOUDS
I DO NOT KNOW HOW I SHOULD HAVE BORNE UP DURING THOSE TWO TERRIBLE DAYS BUT FOR MY FAITHFUL FRIEND
I COULD NOT SEE MISS GERTRUDE FORREST FOR SHE WAS SITTING ON MY SIDE OF THE TABLE BUT I COULD SEE THE PECULIAR EYES OF HEROD VOLTAIRE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT SOME ONE NEARLY OPPOSITE HIM WHILE HE SCARCELY TOUCHED THE VARIOUS DISHES THAT WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE
WE CAN PROMISE A FAIRLY GOOD BILL OF FARE
HE UTTERED SOME STRANGE WORDS THE MEANING OF WHICH WAS UNKNOWN TO ME AND THEN I KNEW SOME MIGHTY FORCES WERE BEING EXERTED IN THAT OLD SHEIK'S HUT
THE BIOLOGICAL OR HYPNOTIC POWER THAT I HAD FELT THAT VERY NIGHT WAS REAL AND ABOVE ALL A FEELING OF DREAD THAT HAD GRIPPED MY BEING WAS REAL
IN THIS TOWN WHERE ALMOST EVERY NATIONALITY WAS TO BE SEEN NO NOTICE WOULD BE TAKEN OF HIM
STILL I THOUGHT THE BALANCE WOULD BE HEAVIEST ON THE SIDE OF HIS RETURNING TO EGYPT
ONCE OR TWICE I THOUGHT OF LEAVING TEMPLE HALL BUT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO DO SO
THINGS WERE INDEED TAKING CURIOUS TURNS AND I WONDERED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT
IT WOULD TAKE AWAY HIS APPETITE JIST LIKE WACCINATION DID BUT AS I INSISTED HE GAVE WAY AND CERTAINLY DID NOT DRAW ANY ONE'S ATTENTION BY HIS AWKWARDNESS
I AM SELFISH
WHO COULD TELL
YOU MUST EXPLAIN THESE MARKS"--POINTING TO FOOTMARKS NEAR THE WATER'S EDGE
IT IS MY WORK NOW TO TELL ABOUT MY SEARCH AFTER KAFFAR
I DID NOT PRAY
IT WAS TRUE TURIN WAS A LARGE TOWN BUT IN THREE DAYS I WAS SURE I COULD FIND HIM
IF THERE WERE A GOD WHO WAS THE SOURCE OF ALL LIFE HE COULD BY ENTERING INTO THE LIFE OF ANY INDIVIDUAL GIVE HIM SUCH FORCES AS WOULD BE SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER FORCE
ORDINARILY I SHOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO MENTION SUCH A MATTER TO A LADY I HAD SEEN SO LITTLE OF BUT THE REQUEST SLIPPED OUT UNTHINKINGLY
SHE WOULD SACRIFICE HER HAPPINESS TO DO WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE HONOURABLE I BELIEVE SHE WOULD THEN MY PATH IS MARKED OUT SAID HE SAVAGELY
BUT WHAT WERE THEY
I WOULD TRY AGAIN
I HAVE MARKED HER FOR MY OWN
WHO CAN BEAR TO THINK OF HAVING TAKEN AWAY A FELLOW-CREATURE'S LIFE
GERTRUDE HAD NOT BEEN IN THEIR ROOM ABOVE FIVE MINUTES BEFORE MISS GRAY CAME TO THE DOOR AND ASKED TO COME IN
SPIRIT OF HELFA LEAVE THE BODY HE SAID
OF COURSE THERE WAS SOME LAUGHING DEMUR AMONG THOSE WHO ENJOYED THEIR AFTER-DINNER WINE BUT WE FOLLOWED THE BENT OF OUR INCLINATION AND FOUND OUR WAY TO THE DRAWING-ROOM
BUT AH
BUT AH
OH AS I SAID JUST NOW IT IS REPORTED TO BE HAUNTED
YOU MUST NOT HOLD ANY COMMUNICATION WITH MISS FORREST MY AFFIANCED BRIDE
I THEREFORE BRIEFLY RELATED WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IN THIS STORY
WE MUST DO THE BEST WE CAN AMONG OURSELVES
I POINTED OUT HOW ACCORDING TO HIS SYSTEM BY ASKING A QUESTION THE FIRST WORD OF WHICH SHOULD BEGIN WITH A CERTAIN LETTER A PARTICULAR THING SHOULD BE INDICATED AND ALL THAT WOULD BE NEEDED WAS THAT THE PERFORMERS SHOULD BE PERFECTLY CONVERSANT WITH THE SYSTEM
STILL IT MUST CONVINCE EVERY UNPREJUDICED MIND THAT THERE IS SOMETHING DEEPER AND MORE WONDERFUL THAN THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE CONSTANTLY PASSING BEFORE YOUR VIEW MISS STAGGLES WHO HAD BEEN ALMOST AS SILENT AS A SPHINX SPOKE NOW
WAS SHE AT HOME
CAN YOU NOT SEE THE NAME THERE YES THERE'S A RAILWAY STATION A FINE ONE
WHERE IS HE I AM TRYIN TO SEE BUT I CAN'T
ANXIOUSLY I INQUIRED AFTER TRAINS BY WHICH I COULD CATCH THE BOATS FOR ENGLAND BUT THE REPLIES WERE VAGUE
THAT WOULD MAKE IT A QUARTER-PAST ELEVEN
VERY WELL WELL SUR THE NIGHT AFORE LAST I WUR UP THERE
THE BODY OF ILFRA LAY EMBALMED BEFORE US AS WE ENTERED
BUT THERE IS NOT I SAID
IF KAFFAR WERE ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE A THOUSAND MEANS OF KEEPING HIM OUT OF MY WAY
OR IF HE SHOULD NOT COME AT ALL
EVIDENTLY BY SOME STRANGE POWER AT WHICH I HAD LAUGHED HE HAD AGAIN MADE ME OBEY HIS WILL AND WHEN HE HAD GOT ME WHERE HE WANTED ME HE ALLOWED ME TO BE FREE
THERE WAS SOMETHING TANGIBLE FOR WHICH TO WORK NOW AND MY HEART GREW LIGHTER
AWAY FROM HER THE SKIES WERE DARK AGAIN GREAT HEAVY WEIGHTS RESTED ON MY HEART AND MY LIFE SEEMED CLOGGED
WHAT KIND OF A MAN A GIANT WITH BROWN HAIR A GIANT WITH BROWN HAIR
PRESENTLY DINNER CAME TO AN END
SEVEN O'CLOCK AND NO NEWS
IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL WHAT I BELIEVE THAT HE'S ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE
HERE IN ENGLAND YOU WOULD CRUELLY DESIGNATE HIM AS SOMETHING BETWEEN A MADMAN AND AN IDIOT BUT THE EASTERNS LOOK NOT THUS UPON THOSE WHO POSSESS NOT THEIR ORDINARY FACULTIES
THE FIRST WAS NOT LIKELY
TO PUT IT AT THE OUTSIDE IT WAS ONLY A FORTY-EIGHT HOURS JOURNEY ALLOWING TIME FOR A SLEEP ON THE WAY
AND NOW HE CONTINUED I PROMISE NOT TO USE MY POWER OVER YOU ON ONE CONDITION NAME IT I SAID
HE WAS A FUNNY CHAP SIR
THE COMPANY QUICKLY SAW THE TRUTH OF WHAT I WAS SAYING AND FOR THE TIME AT ANY RATE MR VOLTAIRE'S MARVELLOUS KNOWLEDGE WAS HELD AT A DISCOUNT
ANOTHER ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMAN WENT WITH HIM
YOU ARE MINE AGAIN HE CRIED
THIS ROUSED HIS IRE MORE WHILE I SAW THAT VOLTAIRE WATCHED ME WITH HIS LIGHT GLITTERING EYE AS IF EXPECTING A SCENE
AS I FELT AT THAT MOMENT IN SPITE OF MY DESIRE TO LET EVERY ONE KNOW THIS MAN'S POWER OVER ME I WOULD RATHER HAVE PULLED OUT MY TONGUE THAN HAVE DONE SO
I FIND THAT MR TEMPLE HAS TOLD YOU ABOUT AN INTERVIEW WHICH WAS HELD IN THE LIBRARY LAST NIGHT YES
I AM VERY SORRY
THERE IS SOME MISTAKE HE TOOK SOMETHING FROM HIS POCKET WHICH WAS WRAPPED IN A HANDKERCHIEF
I PUT ON MY OVERCOAT AND HAT AND DRAWN ON BY AN UNSEEN POWER I WENT AWAY TOWARDS THE FIR PLANTATION IN WHICH THE SUMMER-HOUSE WAS BUILT
BUT I COULD NOT
BUT I COULD NOT
YES HE SAID
I COULD NOT HELP THINKING ABOUT THIS GREAT PROBLEM OF MY LIFE
SHE WAS VERY PALE AND HER EYES SHONE LIKE STARS
HALF THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE ROOM WERE NEARLY AS MUCH MESMERIZED AS YOU WERE
TRUE HE HAD SKETCHED THEM OUT OF PROPORTION WHILE THE STREET WAS FAR MORE STRAIGHT THAN HE HAD DRAWN IT
THERE IS SOME MISTAKE
AND YET I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HER YET
ONE WORD FROM ME AND YOUR LIBERTY IS GONE
I WENT TO MONTE CARLO
I'M BY NO MEANS SUPERSTITIOUS BUT I DO NOT SEE HOW I CAN TRACE IT TO HUMAN ORIGIN I CANNOT SEE WHY ANY GUEST SHOULD ASSUME THE PERSON OF THE TRADITIONAL GHOST BUT SOME MEN HAVE DEEP DESIGNING MINDS
I WAS ACCORDINGLY USHERED INTO A MUSTY ROOM WHICH SADLY WANTED LIGHT AND AIR
NEW YEAR'S DAY WAS COLD AND FORBIDDING
BUT I RESISTED AND I WAS FREE
AT THAT MOMENT THE GUARD'S WHISTLE BLEW AND THE TRAIN MOVED SLOWLY OUT OF THE STATION
I COULD NOT HELP IT--WHY I COULD NOT TELL
ONLY YOU DON'T CARE FOR LADIES SOCIETY AND I'M AFRAID I SHALL HAVE TO BE AWAY FROM YOU A GOOD BIT NATURALLY YOU WILL OLD FELLOW
TWAS TOO HORRIBLE
THEN I HEARD A LOW HIST YOU'RE LATE SAID THE WOMAN'S VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZED AS MISS STAGGLES YES
MR VOLTAIRE IS A WONDERFUL MAN SHE SAID A CLEVER MAN
GOOD-MORNING MR JUSTIN BLAKE HE SAID BLANDLY
PLEASE ACT ACCORDINGLY LADIES THERE ARE GENTLEMEN THERE ARE SHRIEKED THE EGYPTIAN
I ONLY HEARD ONE SOUND
BESIDES IT MIGHT STAGGER HIM SOMEWHAT TO FIND THAT HIS WORDS HAD NOT FRIGHTENED ME
IN SPITE OF TINSEL AND GILT IN SPITE OF GAY ATTIRE AND LOUD LAUGHTER IN SPITE OF HIGH-SOUNDING TITLES AND ANCIENT NAMES NEVER DID I SEE SO MUCH REAL MISERY AS I SAW IN THE FAR-RENOWNED GAMING PALACE
I HAD NOT BEEN THERE LONG BEFORE I HEARD SOME ONE ENTER WITH THE LANDLORD
BUT IN SPITE OF ALL WE COULD NOT HIT UPON ANY PLAN OF ACTION
I WENT TO A CHURCH ONE SUNDAY NIGHT
NOW JUSTIN SHE SAID AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF HAPPY SILENCE YOU MUST AWAY
A WEEK LATER I WALKED IN HYDE PARK
I GOT INTO OXFORD STREET AND GOT ON A BUS
BUT YOUR ENEMY INTENDED YOU SHOULD WHY DID I NOT THEN BECAUSE THE EGYPTIAN ALSO POSSESSED A MESMERIST'S POWER AND HINDERED YOU
I REMEMBERED WHAT THE GHOST WAS SUPPOSED TO FORETELL AND THE EVIL INFLUENCE THE DARK POND WAS SAID TO HAVE
SO FAR THEN MY INQUIRIES WERE SUCCESSFUL
NATURALLY WE TURNED TO LOOK WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND SOMETHING ENTERED WELL WHAT
FOOTMARKS WERE TO BE SEEN ON THE EDGE OF THE DEEP POND INDICATING A STRUGGLE
NEITHER COULD I TELL MISS FORREST WHAT I HAD HEARD WHILE CERTAINLY VOLTAIRE HAD AS MUCH RIGHT AS I HAD TO SEEK TO WIN HER AFFECTIONS
A LOOK OF WONDER BEGAN TO SETTLE ON THE FACES OF THE GUESTS AND EXCLAMATIONS OF SURPRISE AND BEWILDERMENT WERE APPARENT
IT WAS APPARENT THAT NEARLY ALL WERE CONVERTS TO HIS BELIEFS IF BELIEFS THEY MIGHT BE CALLED
I HAD BEEN TELLING THESE LADIES WHAT A TERRIBLE WOMAN-AVOIDER YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
A MONTH LATER I REALLY BELIEVED IN GOD AND SOON I BEGAN TO REALIZE HIS POWER
TORINO THAT'S IT TORINO I CRIED TURIN
AGAIN I BEGAN TO THINK WHAT HE WAS LIKELY TO DO
YOU KNOW I WILL SIMON YOU OFFERED TO BE MY FRIEND NOW NEARLY A YEAR AGO AY AND THIS ERE IS A LAD AS'LL STICK TO HIS OFFER SUR AND MIGHTY PROUD TO DO SO WELL THEN I'M IN HOPES WE SHALL SUCCEED HOW YER HONOUR BY FIGHTING VOLTAIRE WITH HIS OWN WEAPONS WHAT WACCINATIN BY MESMERISM AND CLAIRVOYANCE SIMON AND WHO'S THE CHAP AS HEV GOT TO BE WACCINATED--OR MESMERIZED AS YOU CALL IT YOU IF YOU WILL SIMON ME SIR SAID SIMON AGHAST
ACROSS THE POND IN THE NEAR DISTANCE LOOMED THE DARK FIR TREES
I DID NOT CHANGE CARRIAGES AS I INTENDED
SIMON SLOWDEN LIVES WITH GERTRUDE AND ME
AND YET WHO GAVE US LOVE--MADE US CAPABLE OF LOVING
THE MINISTER WAS I SHOULD THINK A GOOD MAN FOR HE READ IT NATURALLY AND WITH A GREAT DEAL OF POWER
EAGERLY I SNATCHED IT AND READ--"_EXPECT ME HOME TO-NIGHT BY THE MIDNIGHT TRAIN.--KAFFAR I CAUGHT UP A TIME-TABLE AND ANXIOUSLY SCANNED IT
NEED I RELATE WHAT FOLLOWED THAT NIGHT
FOR SOME TIME I COULD NOT GATHER UP MY SCATTERED SENSES
WHY SUR SAID SIMON WHEN I HAD FINISHED THAT ERE WILLAIN MUST BE WUSS NOR A HINFIDEL
SHE NEVER WOULD TELL ME ANYTHING AND THAT'S WHY I DISLIKE HER SO
I HAVE INQUIRED OF THE SERVANTS WHO ALL ASSURE ME OF THEIR ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF THE MATTER AND I CANNOT THINK THAT ANY OF MY GUESTS WOULD ASSUME THE PERSON OF THE TRADITIONAL GHOST FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO FRIGHTEN THE HOUSEKEEPER AND TWO OR THREE SERVANTS
WE WERE MOVED TO TALK IN AN UNCONVENTIONAL STRAIN
OH I WAS MARRIED ON THE CONTINENT WHEN QUITE A GIRL AND I DARED NOT TELL OF IT FOR MY HUSBAND WAS A GAMBLER AND A VILLAIN
COME DOWN FROM THAT HIGH HORSE AND LET'S TALK QUIETLY
THE HOST THEN LEFT THE ROOM WHILE KAFFAR WENT ON WITH HIS SUPPER
I COULD NOT LET YOU DO THAT
HIS HAIR WAS BLACK AS THE RAVEN'S WINGS AND WAS BRUSHED IN A HEAVY MASS HORIZONTALLY ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD
I PUT MY HAND UPON THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WHICH I KNEW BELONGED TO ONE OF THE OFFICIALS TO WHOM I DETERMINED TO REPORT MY CASE
THE HOUR WAS MIDNIGHT AND OUR BUSINESS WAS WITH THE DEAD
WITH SMALL WIRY LIMBS BLACK RESTLESS FURTIVE EYES RUSTY BLACK HAIR AND A SOMEWHAT UNHEALTHY COLOUR IN HIS FACE HE FORMED A GREAT CONTRAST TO THE MAN I HAVE JUST TRIED TO DESCRIBE
ALTOGETHER IT WAS A RIGHT OLD-FASHIONED UNCONVENTIONAL ENGLISH COUNTRY PARTY AND DAY BY DAY WE GOT TO ENJOY OURSELVES MORE BECAUSE WE LEARNED TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER
BUT I WILL NOT WEARY THE READER WITH MY MENTAL WANDERINGS
AND THAT IS WHY I AM SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF
I CAN HAVE NO STRONGER PROOF THAN THAT HE SAID AND THAT BLOOD CRIES OUT FOR VENGEANCE NOW OH I CANNOT SHE SAID I CANNOT YOU REFUSE ME HE SAID QUIETLY
I WAS NOT SURE
FOR THE REST I CARE NOT A JOT HE WENT AWAY LEAVING ME ALONE AND THEN ALL THE SENSATIONS OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHTS CAME BACK TO ME
WITH REGARD TO MISS FORREST HE SAID I ANSWER NOT IN THE LANGUAGE WHICH EVERY ONE HERE KNOWS
MINUTE AFTER MINUTE PASSED BY AND STILL THERE WAS NO THIRD PARTY
IF ANY OF MY READERS HAVE BEEN TO TURIN THEY WILL REMEMBER THE LONG STREET LEADING FROM THE STATION
IF DEAD--WELL THEN I DID NOT CARE MUCH WHAT HAPPENED
IT IS NEARLY TWELVE O'CLOCK I HEARD VOLTAIRE SAY AND HE'S NOT HERE
YOU WILL KNOW MY BUSINESS AT YOUR COST
I SEE LOTS OF PEOPLE ALL DIM LIKE SAID SIMON SLOWLY
I FELT A STRANGE CHILLING SENSATION CREEP OVER ME AND INVOLUNTARILY I SAT DOWN
1890 CONTENTS CHAP
WE CANNOT WRITE ON PAPER OUR DEEPEST FEELINGS
THE WATERS OF THE RIVER LOOKED BLACK WHILE ABOVE ME WERE WEIRD FANTASTIC FORMS LEAPING IN THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
I THINK YOU HAD SAID THE LITTLE PROFESSOR QUIETLY
AND SECOND THE ORDINARY ENGLISH SERVANT IS EXTREMELY UNSUSCEPTIBLE TO THE PLAY OF HIGHER POWERS
I HAD BEEN WONDERING WHAT TO DO AND WHERE TO GO THIS CHRISTMAS TIME AND THIS INVITATION COMES IN SPLENDIDLY TOM TEMPLE LIVED IN YORKSHIRE AT A FINE OLD COUNTRY HOUSE SOME DISTANCE FROM THE METROPOLIS OF THAT COUNTY AND WAS A REALLY GOOD FELLOW
IT WAS FIVE O'CLOCK ON CHRISTMAS EVE WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THIS LITTLE FRENCH SEAPORT AND THEN IT TOOK US TWO HOURS TO CROSS THE STRAITS ALTHOUGH WE HAPPENED TO BE ON ONE OF THE FAST-SAILING STEAMERS
AND WHEN I SAW VOLTAIRE'S SMILE AS HE WATCHED MISS FORREST REPEL ANY ATTEMPT OF MINE TO CONVERSE WITH HER I BEGAN TO WISH I HAD NEVER SET MY FOOT IN TEMPLE HALL
WELL I HAVE FOUND YOU OUT I SAID
FROM DOVER TO PARIS IT WAS FAIRLY COMFORTABLE BUT FROM PARIS TO THE ITALIAN BORDER WE WERE TRAVELLING THROUGH A SNOWSTORM AND THUS WHEN WE CAME TO THIS OUR LAST STOPPING-PLACE BEFORE GOING THROUGH THE FAMOUS MONT CENIS TUNNEL WE WERE FOUR HOURS LATE
THEN SHE SAID ABRUPTLY YOU TOLD ME YOU LOVED ME WHEN WE RODE OUT TOGETHER THE OTHER DAY I DID I SAID AND I DO LOVE YOU WITH ALL THE INTENSITY THAT A HUMAN HEART IS CAPABLE OF LOVING
MEANWHILE YOU MAY FORCE ME TO ACT AGAINST MY WILL BUT MY WILL YOU SHALL NEVER HAVE FOOL IDIOT HE CRIED YOU SHALL REPENT THIS
COULD YOU NOT BY ANY MEANS FIND OUT
THIS IS HER GREAT WEAKNESS WENT ON VOLTAIRE
OF COURSE THIS MIGHT NOT BE SO
IT IS MAY NOW
HE'S COMIN UP HERE WITH HIS LONG-NOSED POINTER WAS THE REPLY AND LL BE ERE IN A JIFFY FIVE MINUTES AFTER DR SHARP CAME INTO THE ROOM
PERHAPS I WAS I SAID LOOKING AT VOLTAIRE
THE MAN WHO HAD SHOWED ME IN IMMEDIATELY ANSWERED THE SUMMONS
PERCHANCE THEY COULD DO WHAT I HAD FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH
YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD MASTER ME DIDN'T YOU WELL I'M MASTER OF YOU BOTH
VOLTAIRE LOOKED AT ME WITH HIS GREEN-TINTED EYES AS IF HE WOULD READ MY INNERMOST THOUGHTS
I WOULD DO MY BEST TO FIND OUT
DO I ANNOY YOU ASTONISH YOU MISS FORREST I SAID
I THOUGHT I MIGHT SEE SIMON SLOWDEN WHO I WAS SURE WOULD BE MY FRIEND AND WAS WATCHING KAFFAR CLOSELY BUT I COULD NOT CATCH SIGHT OF HIM
I'VE NO DOUBT MY COMPANY IS VERY TIRING AND THUS I MUST BE LEFT OUT IN THE COLD NONSENSE REPLIED TOM
I BELIEVE I SAYS THAT IT'S THAT HINFIDEL AND THE SKINNY WIRGIN A-WALKIN TOGETHER THEY GOES INTO THE SUMMER-'OUSE AND THEN I CREEPS DOWN AND GETS BEHIND A TREE BUT CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE COUPLE TO HEAR EVERY WORD
THEY MIGHT BE IMPOSTORS THEY MIGHT BE PENNILESS ADVENTURERS BUT I COULD NOT PROVE IT
IT WOULD BE WEARISOME TO THE READER TO TELL HIM HOW OFTEN I LOOKED AT MY WATCH AND THOUGHT OF THE PRECIOUS HOURS THAT WERE FLYING
DO YOU THINK I KILLED KAFFAR THE EGYPTIAN NO I DO NOT
THE SUN WAS SHINING IN AT MY WINDOW WHEN I AWOKE AND THIS ITALIAN CITY LOOKED WONDROUSLY BEAUTIFUL AS IT LAY THERE THIS CLEAR DECEMBER MORNING IN THE LIGHT OF THE BRIGHT SUN
PUTTING ASIDE THE OTHER PARTS OF THE BOOK THAT IN WHICH I WAS SO FEARFULLY INTERESTED MIGHT BE BRIEFLY STATED THUS MESMERISM AND ANIMAL MAGNETISM MAY BE REGARDED AS HUMAN FORCES
THIS WAS ALSO A TOBACCONIST'S SHOP BUT A DIRTY OLD WOMAN STOOD BEHIND THE COUNTER
YOU SEE SAID VOLTAIRE THE EVIDENT TRUTH OF THIS
BUT KNOWING I HAD NO RIGHT TO LISTEN TO WHAT MIGHT BE PRIVATE CONVERSATION I STARTED A SECOND TIME FOR THE HOUSE WHEN I HEARD THE NAME OF GERTRUDE FORREST AND THEN I SEEMED CHAINED TO THE GROUND
THEN I BEGAN TO THINK WHAT THE EGYPTIAN WOULD BE LIKELY TO DO AND AFTER WEIGHING THE WHOLE MATTER IN MY MIND I CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION
BUT I LIKE YOUR ENGLISH ADAGES AND ONE IS THIS THOSE LAUGH BEST WHO WIN BUT COME HE SAID ALTERING HIS TONE YOU ARE IN MY POWER
I FELT A NEW LIFE GROWING IN ME A HIGHER LIFE
NO PEN CAN DESCRIBE WHAT I FELT NO WORDS CAN CONVEY TO THE MIND THE THOUGHTS AND PAINS OF MY MIND AND HEART
I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE TURNED MY THOUGHTS IN ANOTHER DIRECTION FOR ALL THE GOOD I COULD SEE IT DID ME
THEN ALL MEMORY AND CONSCIOUSNESS CEASED
AH MY FRIEND IT IS DANGEROUS TO FIGHT WITH A MAN WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW HIS WEAPONS I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS I SAID HAUGHTILY
BUT KAFFAR WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN IT CANNOT BE
I ONLY HAD SOME VAGUE GROUNDS FOR THINKING HE WAS
NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE OCCURRED DURING THE RIDE
I MUST DENY MR BLAKE'S STATEMENT HE SAID
AND RIGHT GLAD WERE WE WHEN THE DAY DAWNED ON WHICH THE VEIL SHOULD BE MADE THICKER OR ALTOGETHER DRAWN ASIDE
ALL MY WITS HEV BIN WACCINATED AWAY AND MY BLOOD IS PUDDLED LIKE WHICH HEV AFFECTED THE WORKIN O MY BRAINS
HAD I
HAD I
THE NORTHERN TRAIN HAS BEEN IN NEARLY HALF-AN-HOUR SO THE THREE HAD TO WAIT FOR THE TWO
THAT OF COURSE CAN NEVER BE SO MY BEAUTIFUL BRIDE IS SAFE AND HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A SAVAGE LEER
BUT YOU FOUND NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING HER CONSENT TOM I SAID ONE DAY AT TEMPLE HALL
EVERYTHING SEEMS RIGHT
MISS STAGGLES AROSE FROM HER CHAIR AND RUSHED TOWARDS ME
AFTER A GREAT MANY INQUIRIES I FOUND THAT KAFFAR OR A MAN STRONGLY RESEMBLING HIM HAD BEEN THERE ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION AND HAD TAKEN A TICKET FOR LEEDS
BUT THE RAW BITING WIND SWEPT ACROSS MOOR AND FEN FORBIDDING THE LESS ROBUST PART OF THE COMPANY TO COME AWAY FROM THE WARM FIRES
IT IS I TOM I SAID LOOKING VACANTLY AROUND
I BELIEVE IN DREAMS VISIONS AND RETURNED SPIRITS OF THE DEAD
WIN HER HEROD VOLTAIRE AND YOU CAN BE A LITTLE KING AND I YOUR PRIME MINISTER
IS THIS TRUE TRUE TO THE LETTER
I WAS ASKED FOR MY OPINION I SAID
WHAT IN THE WORLD DREW YOU AWAY SO SUDDENLY I TRIED TO TELL HER BUT I COULD NOT
AND YET I FANCY MUCH OF HIS HIGH-FLOWN TALK ABOUT SPIRITUALISM WAS MERE IMAGINATION I WAS INCLINED TO THINK SO AT FIRST BUT I HAVE HEARD STRANGE THINGS ABOUT HIM
DID THIS GENTLEMAN HAVE ANY LUGGAGE I ASKED
I THINK SOME ONE CAME UP TO ME AND CONGRATULATED ME ON MY COOLNESS IN DEALING WITH THE MAN WHO HAD INSULTED ME SO
BUT THERE WAS MORE THAN MESMERISM REALIZED LAST NIGHT
THE GHOST LAST NIGHT WAS TO DECEIVE TO FRIGHTEN
THE STORY THE GHOST THE QUARREL--IT WAS ALL WELL DONE I FAIL TO SEE WHAT PART THE GHOST HAD IN THE MATTER I SAID
I AM SIMPLY SHOWING HOW YOUR PERFORMANCE CAN BE DONE BY THOSE POSSESSING NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE OCCULT SCIENCES BUT DOES MR BLAKE DECLINE TO BELIEVE THAT WE KNOW NOTHING OF THE MYSTERIOUS--THAT WE HAVE NOT DIVED INTO SUBJECTS OF WHICH THE ORDINARY MIND CAN KNOW NOTHING SAID KAFFAR
AT THAT MOMENT I FELT GRIPPED BY AN UNSEEN POWER AND I WAS IRRESISTIBLY DRAWN TOWARDS THE DOOR
POSSIBLY HE HAD A THOUSAND HAUNTS UNKNOWN TO ME
DID YOU FEEL NO STRANGE INFLUENCES COMING BACK JUST NOW
I HAD SAILED UP THE NILE BY ONE OF THE ORDINARY RIVER STEAMERS TO A PLACE CALLED ABOO SIMBEL CLOSE TO THE SECOND CATARACT
AT FIRST HE DID NOTHING BUT STARE VACANTLY BUT PRESENTLY A LOOK OF INTELLIGENCE FLASHED INTO HIS EYES
IT WAS WEDNESDAY
THE WORDS MEAN THAT HE WILL STAY THERE FOR SOME DAYS CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE STREET IN WHICH THIS HOTEL IS CONTINUED VON VIRCHOW
I CAUGHT HIS MEANING INSTANTLY
THIS MUST BE LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION OF MY READERS
THEY ALL SEEM TO BE COVERED WI A KIND O MIST LOOK AGAIN SAID THE PROFESSOR
I LOOKED AT GERTRUDE FORREST AND ETHEL GRAY WHO WRAPPED IN THEIR DRESSING-GOWNS STOOD SIDE BY SIDE AND I SAW THAT BOTH OF THEM WERE TERRIBLY MOVED
MISS FORREST WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME AT FIRST
PERHAPS"--TURNING I THOUGHT EAGERLY TO ME--"MR BLAKE WILL BE THE ONE NO I SAID
I OPENED MY MOUTH TO TELL TOM THE WHOLE TRUTH BUT I COULD NOT UTTER A WORD
NEVER SHALL I FORGET THE SIGHT
THERE WAS NO BLOOD YER HONOUR
SO SEEING A SOLDIER PASS UP THE STREET I SALUTED HIM AND ASKED HIM WHETHER HE KNEW A LODGING-HOUSE OR PRIVATE BOARDING ESTABLISHMENT IN THE STREET
I STOOD AT THE EDGE OF THE WATER FOR SOME TIME
WELL I GOT A YOUNG FIR TREE PULLED UP AND WAS JIST A-GOING TO LIGHT MY PIPE WHEN I SEE SOME FIGURES A-COMIN THREW THE PLANTATION TOWARDS A SUMMER-'OUSE THAT WAS PUT UP BOUT TWO YEAR AGO
I HAVE GENERALLY BEEN PUT DOWN AS A KIND OF BORE I EXPECT AND I'VE NEVER TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO IMPROVE MY REPUTATION THEN YOU OUGHT SAID MISS GRAY LAUGHINGLY
RETIRE TO REST SWEET LADY AND THINK THAT WHAT I HAVE SAID IS A DREAM VILLAINY CRIED SHE
NOTHING DISCOVERED"--THAT SUMMED UP THE LONG REPORTS THEY SENT ME
I DESISTED HOWEVER AS THERE WERE LADIES PRESENT AND WENT ON QUIETLY TALKING TO MY NEIGHBOUR AS IF HE HADN'T SPOKEN
SOON AFTER KAFFAR BEGAN TO TALK FLUENTLY TO ONE OF THE MISSES TEMPLE WHILE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE PARTY PREPARED FOR A CHARADE
STRUGGLING FOR VICTORY XVII
SAY THEN NOW THAT ALL IS AGAINST ME THAT YOU FORGIVE ME SHE HESITATED A MINUTE BEFORE REPLYING
WE CLUTCHED EACH OTHER SAVAGELY AND WRESTLED THERE ON THE EDGE OF THE POND
THE TRUTH IS"--HERE HE SUNK HIS VOICE TO A WHISPER--"SHE'S VERY THICK WITH THAT WILLAIN WITH A HINFIDEL'S NAME
AND SHE I HARDLY KNOW
I WAS HAPPY IN SPITE OF THE TERRIBLE NET THAT WAS WOVEN AROUND ME
THERE COULD BE NO GOD
SO I THINKIN SMALL-POX BETTER THAN NOTHIN CATCHED THAT
MR KAFFAR HAS LEFT AS HE SAID AND GONE BACK TO EGYPT
LOCK CO LIMITED LONDON AND MELBOURNE MADE AND PRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY WARD LOCK CO LIMITED LONDON
WHEN THE QUARTER OF AN HOUR WAS UP I WENT AWAY WITH A GREAT WEIGHT UPON MY HEART WONDERING YET DREADING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT
WAS SHE THE PROPRIETOR OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT
WHAT JUSTIN HE EXCLAIMED DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THE VILLAIN USED SUCH MEANS TO GET YOU OUT OF HIS ROAD AND WIN MISS FORREST FOR HIMSELF I FELT HE WAS UNSCRUPULOUS WHEN I FIRST MET HIM I REPLIED
IF YOU ARE I SHALL BE UP ALL NIGHT AND WILL BE SO HAPPY TO HELP YOU I THOUGHT I FELT A GENTLE PRESSURE OF HER HAND BUT I WAS NOT SURE
FOR I KNEW NOTHING OF THE LADY I LOVED AND OF COURSE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF HER CARING FOR ME
IF YOU DON'T GET SMALL-POX IN THAT TIME WHY THEN--WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT SO I SAYS SAY YES AT ONCE SUSAN
BUT I'M AFEARED AS OW THIS VOLTAIRE EV GOT SOMETHIN IN HIS HEAD A-CONCOCTIN LIKE NONSENSE SIMON I SAID
FOR ALTHOUGH THE SECRET TO ME WOULD BE AS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT IT WOULD BE TO HIM YET I COULD PUT IT TO SOME USE WHILE TO HIM IT WOULD DISPEL DISTANCE TIME AND PHYSICAL LIFE
TELL ME QUICKLY HE SPOKE PEREMPTORILY AS IF HE HAD A RIGHT TO COMMAND WHILE SHE DID NOT RESENT HIS DICTATORIAL TONES
YES YOU KILLED KAFFAR--KILLED HIM WITH THAT KNIFE YOU HELD IN YOUR HAND
AT NIGHT ESPECIALLY IT WAS GLORIOUS
THEN MY HEART GAVE A GREAT THROB FOR I THOUGHT SHE RETURNED THE PRESSURE OF MY HAND
I HAD PLENTY OF TIME
YOU SEE YOU ARE MASTER OF THE HALL AND WILL HAVE TO LOOK AFTER THE COMFORT OF ALL THE GUESTS OH AS TO THAT MOTHER WILL DO ALL THAT'S NECESSARY
THERE IN THE QUIET OF MY ROOM ALL THIS MESMERISM AND CLAIRVOYANCE SEEMED ONLY SO MUCH HOCUS-POCUS WHICH NO SENSIBLE AND WELL-EDUCATED MAN SHOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
I TURNED TO TAKE A WALK TOWARDS THE PARK GATES WHEN I HEARD A FOOTSTEP AND TURNING SAW SIMON SLOWDEN
IT WOULD BE AS MUCH AS MY PLACE IS WORTH NO IT WOULD NOT I REPLIED
TRUE I PROMISED BUT NOT TO-DAY
AT ANY RATE SIMON GUESSED HOW THINGS WERE AND MORE THAN THAT HE BELIEVED THAT VOLTAIRE HAD SOME SINISTER DESIGN AGAINST ME
YOU BEGGED FOR HIS LIFE AND I OFFERED IT--FOR YOUR LOVE
I COULD DO NOTHING
CHAPTER III CHRISTMAS MORNING WHEN I GOT OUT ON THE LAWN I ACCUSED MYSELF OF DOING A VERY FOOLISH THING
AN OVERMASTERING IMPULSE LAID HOLD OF ME TO FOLLOW THE EGYPTIAN AND I DIMLY REMEMBER GOING INTO THE HALL AND OUT INTO THE SILENT NIGHT
THE YOUNG MEN WERE ABOUT ON A PAR WITH THE YOUNG LADIES
ABA WADY KAFFAR WAS LOOKING AT THE CEILING AS IF CALCULATING HOW MANY SQUARE FEET THERE WERE
USE ALL YOUR SEDUCTIVE ARTS FIRST AND IF YOU FAIL TO WIN HER BY THOSE TRUST ME TO WEAVE SUCH A CHAIN OF EVENTS AS SHALL MAKE HER BECOME MRS VOLTAIRE UP TO THIS POINT I LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND THEN A MINUTE'S SILENCE ON THEIR PART AROUSED ME TO MYSELF
BUT FOR ALL THAT SHE'S NO HYPOCRITE WELL WHAT FOR THAT HE ASKS
IS HE SUFFICIENTLY SUSCEPTIBLE IS THAT THE ONLY HOPE ALL I CAN SEE AT PRESENT
AH ME
I FELT THAT I COULD NOT JOIN THEM SO I WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
AFTER TOSSING ABOUT A LONG TIME I HIT UPON A PLAN OF ACTION AND THEN MY MIND HAD SOME LITTLE REST
WILL YOU TELL ME SAID MISS FORREST WHAT MY AUNT IS DOING JUST NOW SHE MENTIONED NO NAME AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW THE MAN SITTING IN THE CHAIR COULD KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HER
STILL NONE BUT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER SUCH A SPELL CAN IMAGINE WHAT A STRUGGLE I HAD EVEN THEN
WILL IT BE PAINFUL FOR YOU TO KEEP IT PAINFUL JUSTIN SHE CRIED
I SAW THE DARK PINES FROM WHOSE PRICKLY FOLIAGE THE SNOW CRYSTALS WERE FALLING
WHEN I BECAME POSSESSED OF A LIFE WHEREBY I BECAME MASTER OF MY LOWER SELF I FELT FREE FROM VOLTAIRE'S POWER
I SHALL NOT GIVE YOU IN CHARGE--NOT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOUR PALTRY STORY BUT BECAUSE I SHOULD LOSE MISS FORREST BY SO DOING AND I CANNOT AFFORD TO DO THAT IF FOR NOTHING ELSE THAN TO SPITE YOU
WHY SHOULD THE THOUGHTS OF A CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY SO UNFIT ME A STAID OLD BACHELOR OF THIRTY FOR MY USUAL WORK
I ACCORDINGLY GOT THE KEYS FROM KAFFAR AND SIMON AND POINTING OUT THE PORTMANTEAUS TO AN OFFICIAL GAVE HIM A SOVEREIGN TO SEE THEM EXAMINED AND SENT ON TO MY ADDRESS IN GOWER STREET
REMEMBER THIS
I KNEW I WAS RIGHT HE SAID
BECAUSE THEY ARE PLOTTING AGAINST ME
HOW COULD I TELL WHETHER HE WERE ALIVE OR DEAD
HE CONTINUED DOES ANY ONE KNOW OF THESE THINGS BESIDES YOU TWO SHE SAID AT LENGTH
STRANGE FORMS APPEARED TO BE EMITTED FROM HIS EYES WHILE TO ME HIS FORM EXPANDED AND BECAME TERRIBLE IN ITS MIEN
I REMEMBERED HOW IT HAD BEEN SAID THAT THE POND HAD NO BOTTOM AND THAT IT WAS HAUNTED BY THE SPIRITS OF THOSE THAT HAD BEEN MURDERED
IT ALL DEPENDS ON ONE MAN WHO IS HE SIMON SLOWDEN I THINK YOU CALLED HIM SIMON SLOWDEN
OF COURSE YOU DID
HE WRITES SOMETIMES BUT I NEVER RECEIVE HIS LETTERS WITHOUT THINKING OF THE TERRIBLE NIGHT ON THE YORKSHIRE MOORS--OF THE DARK WATERS THE RED HAND AND THE TERRIBLE STRUGGLE
I'M NOT OVERMICH IN LOVE WI THAT CHAP HE SAYS
THE NEXT MORNIN I SEE HER A-AIRIN HER SWEET SELF ON THE LAWN SO I GOES UP TO ER ALL FAMILIAR LIKE AND I SAYS TOP O THE MORNIN MISS STAGGLES WHO ARE YOU MAN SHE SAYS
OH AH I SEE NOW SAID SIMON
THERE'S A LITTLE VILLAGE THERE SIR HAS SPRUNG UP BECAUSE OF LORD S MANSION SIR AND THE COMPANY HAS PUT UP A STATION AND HOW FAR IS THE NEXT STATION BEYOND THAT A LONG WAY SIR
MAY IT BE THE HAPPIEST YEAR YOU HAVE EVER KNOWN SHE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AS IF SHE EXPECTED TO SEE SOME ONE ELSE PRESENT
JES LIKE WOMEN YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE THEY'LL BREAK OUT WILL YOU KINDLY SIT DOWN SAID VOLTAIRE WHILE I GO TO MY ROOM FOR A BOOK WHILE HE WAS GONE I WENT TO SIMON AND SPOKE TO HIM AND THAT GENTLEMAN GOT VERY COMMUNICATIVE
PARDON ME LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BUT I CANNOT STAND BY AND HEAR THE GREATEST OF ALL SCIENCES MALIGNED AND STILL BE QUIET
I'VE TOLD HER THAT MR BLAKE IS A REGULAR MALE FLIRT
YES I SHALL PREPARE SUPPER WHERE IN HIS OWN ROOM JUST SO
I WILL NOT TAX MY READERS PATIENCE BY SO DOING
I'M TOUGH NOUGH SAYS I
I HAVE INDEED I REPLIED BLUNTLY ESPECIALLY AS I DO NOT REMEMBER HAVING DONE ANYTHING THAT SHOULD MERIT YOUR EVIDENT DISLIKE TO ME I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY SHE SAID
BUT IT WAS PLAIN TO ME
IF I WERE A MAN I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO MAKE HIM MY ENEMY I HAVE HEARD OF AN OLD SAYING AT MY HOME I REPLIED WHICH RAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS BRAG IS A GOOD DOG BUT HOLDFAST IS BETTER STILL I SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH BRAG SHE SAID
DO YOU THINK SHE WILL MARRY VOLTAIRE I SAID AFTER A SHORT SILENCE IF I CANNOT FIND KAFFAR OR PROVE THAT HE IS ALIVE I AM SURE SHE WILL JUSTIN
THERE WAS SOMETHING POSITIVELY FASCINATING ABOUT THE MOUTH AND YET IT BETRAYED MALIGNITY--CRUELTY
MAD MAD I MUST HAVE BEEN NEVER TO HAVE THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE
YESTERDAY SIMON CAME TO ME LOOKING VERY GRAVE
THERE WAS ONE HOUR AND THREE-QUARTERS TO GO TO KENSINGTON
THEY ARE ALL ITALIAN WAS THE REPLY
DON'T YOU KNOW IT WAS VERY FOOLISH OF YOU TO THINK OF COMING ALONE NO SAID THE YOUNGER LADY
HE ALWAYS SPOKE TO ME POLITELY AND TO A CASUAL OBSERVER HIS DEMEANOUR TOWARDS ME WAS VERY FRIENDLY
I SAW THE EYELIDS QUIVER THE MOUTH TWITCH AND THEN THE BODY MOVED
YOU DID NOT THINK I COULD CRUSH YOU LIKE A GRASSHOPPER DID YOU
AT ALL EVENTS I HAD TO REMAIN UNTIL THE TRAIN STOPPED SO I COMPOSED MYSELF AS WELL AS I COULD AND RESOLVED TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT
THE ENVELOPE WAS ADDRESSED IN A BOLD HAND-WRITING TO JUSTIN M
BE MY WIFE AND I WILL BE YOUR SLAVE
THANK YOU SO MUCH AH THAT WILL DO WILL IT HE SAID WITH A SMILE
HE SMILED BLANDLY
A STRANGE GLEAM WAS EMITTED FROM HIS LIGHT GREY EYES WHILE HIS LIPS BECAME ASHY PALE
THAT IS ALL I THINK I NEED SAY CONCERNING MYSELF PRIOR TO THE TIME WHEN MY STORY OPENS EXCEPT TO TELL MY NAME
ONLY A FEW GUESTS REQUIRED THEIR ATTENDANCE
WILL ANY GENTLEMAN OR LADY SHOW ME ANY CURIOSITY HE OR SHE MAY HAVE ACCORDINGLY SEVERAL OF THE PARTY PULLED FROM THEIR POCKETS ARTICLES OF INTEREST AND OF WHICH NEITHER VOLTAIRE NOR KAFFAR COULD HAVE KNOWN
I'VE TRIED
I HAD HOPED TO SPARE YOUR FEELINGS BUT THE TONE OF YOUR DEMAND MAKES ME SPEAK HE HAS NO PROOF FOR WHAT HE IS GOING TO SAY I SAID
YES IT DOES SEEM REMARKABLE
I FORMED A NEW RESOLUTION
DO WHAT I WOULD I COULD NOT REPRESS A START FOR TO MY SURPRISE I SAW MY TRAVELLING COMPANIONS ENTER WITH MISS TEMPLE--GERTRUDE FORREST LOOKING MORE CHARMING AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER AND BESIDE HER MISS STAGGLES TALL GAUNT AND MORE FORBIDDING THAN WHEN IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE
YES SHE SAYS BUT HE HAS COME SAYS SHE
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN
I THINK IT FAIR THAT HE SHOULD CONSENT TO TEST THIS FOR HIMSELF CERTAINLY NOT I REPLIED
ONLY ONE THING CAN MAKE ME HAPPY I SAID AND THAT CAN NEVER BE NOW
I MUST KNOW YOUR REASONS FOR SO DOING BEFORE I ANSWER ANY MORE I BEGAN TO CHIDE MYSELF FOR MY FOLLY
YOU'LL ATTEND TO MY WISHES WITH REGARD TO OUR FRIEND WON'T YOU
I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS EVER RETURNED TO ENGLAND
I STOOD BY A WELL-REMEMBERED SPOT
I LONGED TO KNOW WHAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT BUT HER FACE REVEALED NOTHING
AT ANY RATE SUCH WAS THE CASE
I DARED NOT DWELL UPON THE THOUGHT
MIGHT NOT MY BLIND PASSION HAVE SWEPT ME ON TO THIS DARK DEED
YOU SAW KAFFAR CHALLENGE MR BLAKE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM I SAW HIM INSULT MR BLAKE
HE REMOVED THIS WRAPPING AND THERE REVEALED THE KNIFE YOU HELD IN YOUR HAND
BUT I AM DEBARRED FROM THAT HERE
IT APPEARS THAT SHE HAS MEANS WHICH WERE UNKNOWN TO HER FRIENDS AND THUS SHE KEEPS HIM SUPPLIED
HE SEEMED TO CARRY A HUNDRED SECRETS AROUND WITH HIM AND EACH ONE A DEADLY WEAPON HE WOULD SOME DAY USE AGAINST ANY WHO MIGHT OFFEND HIM
HOUR AFTER HOUR PASSED BY UNTIL NIGHT CAME ON
KAFFAR HAS GONE BACK TO EGYPT
HIS EVERY FEATURE INDICATED THAT HE WAS NOT AN ENGLISHMAN
I WOULD KNOCK AT EVERY HOUSE IN THE STREET AND MAKE INQUIRIES BEFORE I WOULD GIVE UP
STREET CHELSEA
I HAD IF I WAS TO WIN GERTRUDE FOR MY WIFE TO BREAK AND CRUSH VOLTAIRE'S POWER OVER ME
QUITE SURE SIR SAID JANE SMILING AND THEN WITH A CURTSEY SHE TOOK HER LEAVE
HE ONLY CAME A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO DAYS AGO AND HIS HABITS SEEMED UNCERTAIN
I WAS REARED UNDER EGYPT'S SUNNY SKIES
AND THEN I WONDERED HOW LONG MISS FORREST WOULD BE BEFORE SHE CAME AND WHAT SHE WOULD TELL ME
THEN IF THAT IS THE CASE YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO MY ADVICE
AND AS FOR FLESH SHE AIN'T GOT NONE WELL WHAT FOR THAT AND NOT HONLY THAT HE CONTINUED WITHOUT HEEDING MY QUESTION SHE HAIN'T A GOT A HOUNCE OF TENDER FEELIN'S IN HER NATUR
BUT I LOVED HIM
FOR BOTH WERE DESTINED AS MY STORY WILL SHOW TO HAVE CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE OVER MY LIFE
I EXPECTED THAT
AT LENGTH TOM TEMPLE SAID WOULD ONE OF THE SERVANTS DO VOLTAIRE I WOULD RATHER HAVE A VISITOR SAID VOLTAIRE AND FOR TWO REASONS
HE KNEW WHAT THE PARTICULAR FORM IN WHICH THE GHOST APPEARED PORTENDED AND IT FITTED IN WITH HIS SCHEME OF MURDER
MIGHT I ASK IF YOU ARE SOMEWHAT OF A--WELL A GENTLEMAN FOND OF PLAY I DID NOT REPLY
BUT HE"--POINTING AT ME--"IS NO GENTLEMAN
LOOK HERE HEROD VOLTAIRE
ABOU ON THE OTHER HAND WAS KIND TO ME AND TAUGHT ME MUCH AND TOGETHER WE TRIED TO FIND OUT WHAT FOR YEARS HE HAD BEEN VAINLY SEARCHING
DURING THESE DAYS I WAS ENTIRELY FREE FROM VOLTAIRE'S INFLUENCE AS FREE AS I WAS BEFORE I SAW HIM
WHEN I WAS QUITE A LAD I REMEMBER AN OLD SCOTCHWOMAN VISITED OUR HOUSE
FOR MY SAKE SPARE HIM YOUR ONLY SON
I FOUND THAT KAFFAR COULD NOT SPEAK ITALIAN
I MUST GO TO SCOTLAND YARD AND RELATE TO THE AUTHORITIES MY WHOLE STORY
I BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN THE IDEA THAT HE HAD GONE TO EGYPT AS HE HAD SAID
IT WAS NOW JUNE AND TERRIBLY HOT EVEN AT BRINDISI
CHRISTMAS NIGHT--THE FORGING OF THE CHAIN VI
THE MAN HAD PROMISED TO ACCOMPANY ME WILLINGLY WHILE I HAD EXPECTED A DIFFICULT MATTER IN GETTING HIM TO ENGLAND
MY FRIEND'S SPIRIT WOULD HAUNT ME FROM TOWN TO TOWN AND LAND TO LAND MR TEMPLE SHE CRIED TO ME YOU WILL NOT TELL WILL YOU
BUT IT'S THE WACCINATIN YER HONOUR--IT'S THE WACCINATION
MR VOLTAIRE CAME YES HE OVERTOOK US
HIS COMPANION WAS MUCH SMALLER AND EVEN DARKER THAN HE WAS
AGAIN REPORTS FROM THE DETECTIVES CAME AND STILL NO NEWS
I COULD BEAR ANYTHING AFTER HEARING THOSE WORDS
THAT WHICH TROUBLED ME MOST WAS THE FACT THAT I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WERE ALIVE
HE MADE A LEAP FOR THE DOOR
A MORE DREARY PLACE ONE COULD NOT WELL SEE
THAT I HADN'T COURAGE TO RESIST A MAN MANFULLY BUT WOULD ACT TOWARDS AN ENEMY IN A CUNNING SERPENT-LIKE WAY
WHAT I SEE HE WILL SEE ALTHOUGH IN YOUR IDEA OF THE MATTER HE DOES NOT SEE AT ALL
DONE HE REPEATED
THE SERVANT WAS NOT SURE BUT WOULD ASCERTAIN
THERE WERE FOUR MONTHS IN WHICH TO ACT
STILL WE'LL TRY.--SIMON THAT'S ME SAID SIMON SLEEPILY
I KNOWS THEY'RE ON'Y GOT UP TO ARROW UP THE FEELIN'S O TENDER FEMALES
WELL I'LL DO AS YOU WISH ME I FOLLOWED THE SERVANT WHILE SIMON KEPT FAST HOLD ON KAFFAR
AH IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
ARE THOSE ALL YOUR COMMANDS I SAID HUMBLY
ONLY THE GREAT SPIRIT ABOVE KNOWS WHAT I HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO GIVE UP WHEN I TOLD YOU THE CONDITION ON WHICH I WOULD BE SILENT
GOD ALONE KNOWS HOW HAPPY WE WERE
YOU FEAR I MIGHT PRODUCE HIM
COME UP TO-NIGHT AND WIN SOME OF OUR ITALIAN GOLD WHEN WILL MR KAFFAR BE BACK HE SAID HE MIGHT BE BACK ON MONDAY NIGHT--ON TUESDAY MORNING AT LATEST I DAREN'T COME AND PLAY TILL HE COMES I SAID
MR BLAKE WOULD NEVER DO SUCH A THING
MR BLAKE SHE SAID AFTER PAUSING A SECOND DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT DAY WHEN WE LAST RODE OUT TOGETHER WE WERE TALKING OF MR VOLTAIRE I SAID
UNDER SOME SECRET INFLUENCE SIMON SLOWDEN WAS LED TO THE PIANO AND THERE EXECUTED SOME OF THE LATEST AND MOST DIFFICULT PIECES OF MUSIC AND WITHOUT HESITATION TOLD THINGS THAT WERE AT LEAST MARVELLOUS
DINNER HAS BEEN POSTPONED ON ACCOUNT OF YOU LATE ARRIVALS BUT IT WILL BE READY IN HALF-AN-HOUR I WAS NOT LONG OVER MY TOILET AND SOON AFTER HEARING THE FIRST DINNER BELL I WENDED MY WAY TO THE DRAWING-ROOM WONDERING WHO AND WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE I SHOULD MEET BUT WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THE SURPRISES THAT AWAITED ME
I DETERMINED TO GO ON TO PARIS
I FELT I WAS NEAR THE END OF MY JOURNEY AND I BEGAN TO WONDER AT MY CONDITION
HE IS AT ONCE A VIPER A VILLAIN AND A COWARD
BEING AN ABSTAINER I ASKED LEAVE TO RETIRE WITH THE LADIES
I AM GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO EVERYBODY CONTINUED THE OLD LADY FOR THIS IS TO BE A FAMILY GATHERING AND WE MUST ALL KNOW EACH OTHER
I WENT TO THE HOUSE PONDERING THESE THINGS IN MY MIND AND ARRIVING THERE HEARD THE HALL CLOCK STRIKE THE QUARTER FROM WHICH I KNEW IT WAS A QUARTER PAST SIX
ON LOOKING INTO THE ROOM I SAW THAT THE HOUSEKEEPER WAS LYING IN A SWOON ONE OF THE SERVANTS WAS IN HYSTERICS WHILE SIMON SLOWDEN WHO WAS IN THE ROOM AND THE PAGE BOY LOOKED AS WHITE AS SHEETS AND WERE TREMBLING EVIDENTLY WITH FEAR
OH SPARE HIM FOR MY SAKE I NEED NOT ENTER INTO THE FURTHER EXPLANATIONS SHE MADE NOR HOW SHE PLEADED FOR MERCY FOR HIM FOR THEY WERE PAINFUL TO ALL
BUT THAT DID NOT HELP ME FORWARD
HIS TALK WITH KAFFAR BEHIND THE SHRUBS THE NIGHT BEFORE WAS REAL
YES I HAVE ONE OTHER COMMAND FOR YOU
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY MR VOLTAIRE AND HIS FRIENDS HAVE COME A FEW YEARS TOO LATE TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION
A SALLOW-FACED GIRL OPENED THE DOOR AND ASKED MY BUSINESS
GOD ONLY GIVES US POWER TO USE AND HE WILL NOT DO FOR US WHAT WE CAN DO FOR OURSELVES
I WENT HOME AND PRAYED--PRAYED TO BE DELIVERED FROM THE EVIL POWER WHICH CHAINED ME
HE HAS PROMISED TO TAKE MY LIFE-BLOOD IF I DO NO HARM SHALL HAPPEN TO YOU I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT ALLOW HIM TO TOUCH ME HE SHALL NOT THEN I WILL GO MY POINT WAS GAINED
BE YOUR WIFE SHE SAID
YES I'VE NO DOUBT YOU WOULD HAVE ENJOYED A RIDE WITH A CERTAIN LADY BETTER THAN THE LONELY WALK YOU HAVE HAD
BUT THE ONLY THING THAT COULD MAKE ME THINK OF TRYING TO DO WHAT IS TEN THOUSAND TIMES MY DUTY TO DO IS THAT YOU WILL GIVE ME SOME HOPE THAT IF I SHOULD SUCCEED YOU WILL BE THE WIFE OF SUCH A POOR THING AS I AM SHE LOOKED AT ME INTENTLY
ESPECIALLY SO AS MISS FORREST HAD VOLUNTARILY COME TO MY SIDE AND WE HAD GALLOPED AWAY TOGETHER
I DID DISPEL THEM AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS RETURNED TO MY LODGINGS AND DID A GOOD MORNING'S WORK
AT THE SAME TIME I DETERMINED TO HAVE A WATCH SET UPON VOLTAIRE AND HIS EVERY STEP DOGGED SO THAT IF HE HELD ANY COMMUNICATION WITH KAFFAR NECESSARY STEPS MIGHT BE TAKEN TO PROVE TO MISS FORREST MY INNOCENCE AND THUS SHE MIGHT AT ONCE BE FREED FROM THE DESIGNS OF THE MAN SHE HATED
WE BOTH TURNED AND SAW HEROD VOLTAIRE STANDING BY A BOOKCASE WITH AN OPEN VOLUME IN HIS HAND
IT LOOKED LIKE A WOMAN VERY TALL AND SHE HAD A LONG WHITE SHROUD AROUND HER AND ON IT WERE SPOTS OF BLOOD
CAN IT BE HE
IF I COULD BUT KNOW THAT MY LOVE WERE NOT IN VAIN
SHE WAS A CAPABLE WOMAN ABLE TO ATTEND TO THE WANTS OF HER GUESTS WHILE HER DAUGHTER WAS A UNIVERSAL FAVOURITE BECAUSE OF POLITENESS TO CUSTOMERS AND THE GOOD TOBACCO SHE SOLD
FORGIVE ME AND I'LL NEVER DO SO NO MORE
WAS NOT I THE VICTIM OF SOME QUIXOTIC IDEAS
I FELT HER HAND TREMBLE IN MINE AS SHE SPOKE
I FOUND HOWEVER THAT I COULD HIRE A HORSE AND TRAP THAT WOULD TAKE ME THERE IN ABOUT TWO HOURS
HE WORE GOLD-RIMMED SPECTACLES AND WAS EVIDENTLY WELL FED AND ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIMSELF
DON'T ACCUSE HIM OF LACK OF FAITH IN THE UNSEEN
THE FIRST DAY I SAW YOU I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU
MISS FORREST'S AUNT HAD LOOKED FEARFULLY FIRST AT VOLTAIRE THEN AT ME
I KNEW THE HEAT MUST BE WORSE IN CAIRO BUT THAT WAS NOTHING
I WILL SAY NO MORE COME TO WHAT REPEATED MISS FORREST
I'M WILLIN FOR ANYTHING IF YOU CAN GIT THE HUPPER AND OF THAT ERE WILLAIN AND HIS OTHER SELF
IT WAS VERY COLD AND MY FEET CRUNCHED THE FROZEN SNOW
SURELY YOU MUST BE ABLE TO I CANNOT TOM
THERE WERE ONLY THREE PASSENGERS THAT NIGHT--I REMEMBER IT VERY WELL BECAUSE MY BROTHER WAS HERE WITH ME--AND THEY WERE ALL YORKSHIRE THIS MIDNIGHT TRAIN IS A STOPPING TRAIN YES SIR
I SEEMED TO BE MAD
TISN'T MUCH YOU THINK
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO LEAVE ME BUT HE KEPT CLOSE BY MY SIDE AS IF HE WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING
I DENY YOUR POWER DO YOU HE SAID
BUT IT WAS A LOOK OF VICTORY OF POWER
BUT WHAT IS THE USE
HE WALKED DOWN THE STAIRS WITHOUT A WORD AND THEN OUT INTO THE STREET
STILL BY DREARWATER POND
PARTLY I WAS MASTER OVER MY ACTIONS AND PARTLY I WAS UNDER AN INFLUENCE WHICH I COULD NOT RESIST
I KNOW HE WAS FAULTY I KNOW HE DARED THE ANGER OF YOUR ENGLISH GIANT BUT I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD COME TO THIS COME TO WHAT SHE ASKED EAGERLY
I WOULD SEEK TO UNDECEIVE MISS FORREST TOO WHOSE BEHAVIOUR WAS NOW EXPLAINED
AND YET I WISH TO DO YOU NO HARM
THE ANSWER WAS IN ARABIC AND WAS SPOKEN BY KAFFAR
I WISH I COULD FOR THEN OUR WORK WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED HAVE YOU BIN A-WACCINATIN ME SAID SIMON
IT WAS NOW TEN O'CLOCK AND I COULD DO NOTHING THAT NIGHT IN ANY CASE
INDEED THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS IN THE STORY ARE SO INFLUENCED BY IT THAT THE AUTHOR IS LED TO MAKE QUITE A STUDY OF THESE OCCULT SCIENCES I DID NOT READ THE REVIEW FURTHER
I HAD EXPECTED AT LEAST HALF-A-DOZEN BUT ONLY ONE LAY ON THE TRAY BEFORE ME
THAT MEANS THAT YOU DO NOT LIKE THEM SHE SAID
WELL THEN PERHAPS OUR HOST WILL
I INQUIRED AT THE HOTELS
IT WAS NEITHER
OH YOU COLD-BLOODED ENGLISH PEOPLE DON'T MISTAKE THE IMPULSIVE EGYPTIAN
WHAT ARE THE SERVANTS DOING AT THIS TIME THE COOK'S EXAMININ A GOOSE WAS THE REPLY AND THE HOUSEMAID'S TALKING WI A CHAP AS IS JUST COME FROM T VILLAGE HE WENT ON TELLING WHAT THE REST WERE DOING
SHE LOOKED AT ME STRANGELY
I THOUGHT YOU HAD IMPROVED THE FIRST DAY OR SO AFTER YOU CAME BUT YOU SEEM TO HAVE FALLEN BACK INTO YOUR OLD WAYS DON'T PUT THE FAULT ON ME TOM I SAID
AFTER DINNER I SEE HER COME OUT OF THE DRAWIN'-ROOM AND GO AWAY BY HERSELF AND I THOUGHT I'D WATCH
THE HALL GHOST CRIED THE LADIES HYSTERICALLY
AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF QUESTIONING ON THE PART OF THE LADY GUESTS AND MANY SOOTHING REPLIES ON THE PART OF THE MEN SOMETHING LIKE QUIETNESS WAS AT LENGTH RESTORED AND MANY OF THE BRAVER ONES BEGAN TO RETURN TO THEIR ROOMS UNTIL TOM AND I WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE SERVANTS HALL
THE VAPID DANCING SOCIETY MANNIKIN IS EVERYWHERE AN OBJECT OF CONTEMPT WHILE A SOCIETY GIRL AS GENERALLY ACCEPTED IS NOT A WHIT MORE TO MY TASTE I SAW SHE WAS PLEASED AT THIS AND I FELT I LOVED HER MORE THAN EVER
I WAS A COWARD I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HIM SHE SAID
I SET MY TEETH TOGETHER AND VOWED TO BE FREE BUT LOOKING AGAIN AT VOLTAIRE'S EYES MY FEELINGS UNDERWENT ANOTHER REVULSION
BUT NO I WILL NOT ENTERTAIN SUCH A THOUGHT
I WENT TO MY ROOM AND TRIED TO THINK BUT I COULD NOT
I WILL NOT TELL YOU A TALE OF VILLAINY
HE WAS HOWEVER A GOOD-HEARTED FELLOW AND FOR A WONDER CONSIDERING HIS HISTORY AS HONEST AS THE DAY
I RECOGNIZED IT AS BELONGING TO KAFFAR
OH MESMERISM IS A VULGAR AFFAIR
WE DID NOT WAIT A MINUTE BEFORE OPERATIONS WERE COMMENCED
THIRTY-SIX HOURS AND MANY HUNDREDS OF DREARY WEARY MILES BETWEEN
WOULD GERTRUDE BE FREED FROM VOLTAIRE
BUT THE DIFFICULTY LIES HERE
HIS APPEARANCE WAS SO REMARKABLE THAT ANY COUNTRYMAN WOULD STOP FOR A SECOND LOOK AT HIM
THE MAN WHO DESTROYED HIS EVERY HOPE STOOD BEFORE US ALL AND REFUTED HIS TERRIBLE CHARGES
BUT THESE ARE THE THINGS I WOULD HAVE STUDIED AND THUS LIFT THE LIFE OF MAN BEYOND HIS POOR MATERIAL SURROUNDINGS BY THIS TIME THE DRAWING-ROOM WAS PRETTY WELL FULL
WELL YOU WILL PERHAPS KNOW THAT MR KAFFAR IS A VERY ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMAN AND HE LEFT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON FOR A LITTLE TOUR--WHERE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN ASKED TOM TEMPLE A LITTLE ANGRILY
BUT YOU REFUSED
I DID NOT LIKE HAVING CONFIDENCES IN THIS WAY
AND YET AT THE TIME I DID NOT KNOW
SHE'S A BIT OV A COLD IN ER CHEST AND HOUSEKEEPER IS GWINE TO TAKE SOME WARMIN STUFF TO HER I'LL KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE TO-MORROW SAID MISS FORREST AND THEN RELAPSED INTO SILENCE
SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF ME BUT QUIETLY ARRANGED HER BELONGINGS AS IF SHE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF
NOW I MUST USE HIS FEAR OF ME TO MAKE HIM DO MY WILL
BUT IF HE LEAVES DISGRACED PROVED TO BE A VILLAIN A DECEIVER A BLACKLEG OR WORSE THAN THAT WHILE I SHOW UP AS AN ANGEL OF LIGHT I DON'T KNOW SHE SAYS
WE WERE THE SPORT OF CHANCE AND CHANCE MEANT THE DESTRUCTION OF ANYTHING LIKE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY
WAS LOVE THE RESULT OF CHANCE WHICH WAS IN REALITY NOTHING
BEGINNING TO SEARCH XVI
I HAD BEEN BACK IN THE DRAWING-ROOM PERHAPS TEN MINUTES WHEN VOLTAIRE AND KAFFAR RETURNED AND APPARENTLY ENTERED WITH GREAT ZEST INTO THE FESTIVITIES OF THE EVENING
OF THAT I WAS SURE BUT AT THE TIME MY MIND WAS TOO CONFUSED TO SEE HOW
T'OTHER CHAP'S CALLED HEROD PITY THIS ONE ISN'T CALLED JUDAS
CHAPTER XV BEGINNING TO SEARCH NO SOONER DID I BEGIN TO FEEL FREED FROM VOLTAIRE'S POWER THAN I BEGAN TO EXERT MYSELF TO FIND KAFFAR IF INDEED HE WERE TO BE FOUND
THEN YOU GO TO CHURCH THIS MORNING I SAID SEEKING TO TURN THE CONVERSATION AS NATURALLY AS I COULD
I AM SORRY THOSE LADIES HAD TO BE MADE RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE BUT GUESTS HAVE BEEN ARRIVING ALL THE DAY AND THUS THINGS ARE A BIT UPSET
IT WAS NOT MY HEART THAT CONCEIVED THE THOUGHT
HE WAS A COWARD AND STOOD IN DEADLY FEAR OF ME
YOU MUST EXCUSE ME FOR WRITING IN THIS UNCONVENTIONAL STRAIN BUT I CAN'T WRITE OTHERWISE TO MY OLD SCHOOLFELLOW
WHERE THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT SAID SIMON
I HAILED A HANSOM BUT THE CABBY REFUSED TO TAKE THE THREE OF US UPON WHICH KAFFAR OFFERED TO GO IN ANOTHER
BY MIDNIGHT HOWEVER THE OLD HALL WAS SILENT
GOOD-NIGHT IMMEDIATELY HE LEFT FOLLOWED BY KAFFAR I EXPERIENCING A SENSE OF RELIEF
WAIT A MINUTE I SAID TO THE CABBY
ACCORDINGLY THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN AN AUSTRIAN LLOYD STEAMER STOPPED AT THIS LITTLE OLD-FASHIONED SEAPORT ON ITS WAY TO ALEXANDRIA I SECURED A BERTH AND WENT ON BOARD
WHEN ONCE BACK IN LONDON I WOULD ENGAGE THE CLEVEREST DETECTIVES THE CITY COULD BOAST OF AND I WOULD STATE THE WHOLE CASE TO THEM
COULDN'T DO IT FOR TEN SOVEREIGNS SIR SAID THE CABBY
CAN YOU I WENT ON TELL THE WHEREABOUTS OF A MAN WHOM I MAY DESCRIBE TO YOU THAT IS VERY VAGUE WAS THE REPLY
THE IMPOSSIBLE SEEMED POSSIBLE AND YET EVERYTHING WAS MISTY
THAT IS ALL I NEED WRITE CONCERNING THE BOOK I HAVE MENTIONED I.E
HER NATURE IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE
DO YOU RELINQUISH ALL THOUGHTS ALL HOPES OF EVER WINNING GERTRUDE FORREST IN SPITE OF MY STRANGE SITUATION I COULD NOT HELP SEEING TWO RAYS OF LIGHT
WHY SHOULD I STRUGGLE AND RESIST
THE ADJOINING ROOM IS EMPTY SIR THANK YOU I REPLIED WHILE HE LED THE WAY TO THE ROOM
I HAD WRITTEN ONLY ONE NOVEL AND THAT WAS A VERY POOR ONE
CHAPTER X THE COMING OF THE NIGHT DIRECTLY AFTER BREAKFAST I WENT AWAY ALONE
YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT SOME TERRIBLE PIECE YOU'VE ACTED IN AND YOUR IMAGINATION IS CARRYING AWAY YOUR JUDGMENT I HOPE AS OW TIS SUR
AND YET I REALIZED THIS--ALTHOUGH MY BODY WAS CHAINED MY MIND WAS STILL FREE AND ACTIVE
A LITTLE LATER IN THE AFTERNOON HE WAS AGAIN TALKING WITH KAFFAR AND INSTINCTIVELY I FELT THAT I WAS THE SUBJECT OF HIS CONVERSATION
AT LENGTH I ENTERED A FIR WOOD AND I BEGAN TO FEEL MORE MY REAL SELF
I STOOD MOTIONLESS AND WATCHED WHILE THE OUTLINE OF THE HAND BECAME MORE CLEAR
SOME LISPED AND WERE AFFECTED SOME WERE NATURAL AND MANLY
I LOVED MY FRIEND AS JONATHAN LOVED DAVID AND HE IS DEAD--MURDERED BY AN ENEMY'S HAND
NO SHE SAID
MY WIFE MISS FORREST HE REPLIED
BUT HE WAS HANDSOME AND FASCINATING AND SO HE WON ME
I NEED MAKE NO SPECIAL MENTION OF MOST OF THEM
WAS JESUS CHRIST STILL THE SAME WONDERFUL POWER
I TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIM HOWEVER--NEVER REPLIED TO HIS INSULTING WORDS
SURELY THE QUIVERING HAND THE TREMULOUS MOUTH THE DOWNCAST EYE MEANT SOMETHING
STILL THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MY FAVOUR
WE ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM TOGETHER WHERE I FOUND A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAD GATHERED
ALTHOUGH IT WAS CHRISTMAS EVE I FOUND AN EMPTY FIRST-CLASS CARRIAGE AND SOON COMFORTABLY ENSCONCED MYSELF THEREIN
I AM GLAD YOU HAVE COME HOW ARE YOU THIS MORNING
DISAPPOINTMENT ASTONISHMENT ANNOYANCE AND HAUTEUR ALL WERE EXPRESSED
OH ARE YOU SAFE--ARE YOU SAFE SHE SAID HUSKILY
HE DARE NOT COME NEAR ME
AFTER ALL REMARKED SIMON SLOWLY IT SHOWS US HOW A FELLER CAN LIVE AWAY FROM HIS BODY DON'T IT THEN
I KNOW HE DID
AND YET SOME THINGS WERE TERRIBLY REAL
I BEGAN TO DREAD SOME TERRIBLE CALAMITY
THE IDEA MADDENED ME
STRUGGLE SAID HOPE AND DUTY AND LOVE
I WILL SUFFER ANYTHING RATHER THAN YOU SHOULD BE--BE RING THE BELL FOR A SERVANT I SAID
IT WOULD BE CHILD'S PLAY TO FIND KAFFAR THERE
OH TELL US A STORY OF SECOND SIGHT AND SPIRITUALISM AND ALL THAT YOU KNOW REPLIED A YOUNG LADY WITH A DOLL'S FACE AND SIMPERING MANNER
NEVER DID I LOVE MISS FORREST SO MUCH NEVER WAS VOLTAIRE'S VILLAINY SO REAL
IF I DO YOU WILL QUICKLY KNOW
IF HE WERE NOT SPURRED ON BY THOUGHT OF REWARD SHORT AS THE DISTANCE WAS THERE WAS NO KNOWING HOW LONG HE WOULD BE
IF SHE AVOIDS HIM SHE DISLIKES YOU AND DO YOU THINK SHE CARES ABOUT BLAKE SAYS HE
DEATH WAS NOT DEATH TO HIM--HIS EYES PIERCED THAT DARK BARRIER
OH I TELL YOU MISS FORREST A THOUSAND EVIL POWERS SEEM TO REND ME WHEN I ATTEMPT TO DO WHAT I LONG FOR I SHALL TRUST IN YOU SHE CRIED
JUST SO SAID VOLTAIRE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS ON THE PROGRAMME FOR TO-NIGHT I SAID WHEN THEY WERE OUT OF HEARING
STILL NO HELP CAME
I ACCORDINGLY TURNED TO MY DESK WROTE TO TOM TELLING HIM TO EXPECT ME ON THE 24TH INST AND THEN WITHOUT FINISHING MY BREAKFAST ENDEAVOURED TO GO ON WITH MY WORK
I MEANT THAT YOU SHOULD
YER HONOUR HE CONTINUED AFTER I WUR WACCINATED I BROKE OUT IN A KIND OF RASH ALL OVER AND THAT ERE RASH MUST HAVE ROBBED ME OF MY SENSES
IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO FORGIVE I DO FORGIVE YOU I REPLIED ESPECIALLY AS I DESPISE THAT CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS AS MUCH AS YOU
I HAVE DONE YOUR BIDDING I SAID AFTER A MINUTE'S SILENCE
HIS TERRIBLE EYES BECAME BRIGHTER THAN EVER
WHAT IS IT YOU AIN'T A-SEEN THAT ERE HINFIDEL WILLAIN SINCE HE WENT AWAY FROM ERE MR BLAKE HAVE EE I SAW HIM IN HYDE PARK ONE DAY BUT HAVE NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM WELL I'M IN A FOG IN A FOG
JUST THE VERY THING I EXCLAIMED
THERE'S A BLACK FOG A-COMIN UP WAIT A FEW MINUTES SAID THE PROFESSOR AND THEN WE'LL TRY HIM AGAIN PRESENTLY HE SPOKE AGAIN
THEN I HEARD TOM SAY HE'S BETTER NOW
AFTER DINNER WE ALL FOUND OUR WAY TO THE DRAWING-ROOM WHEN THE USUAL SINGING FLIRTING AND DANCING PROGRAMME WAS CARRIED OUT
WHICH WAY DID THEY GO AND HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN GONE I ASKED
I LONGED TO AVENGE THE INSULTS THAT HAD BEEN OFFERED
AND NO SOONER DID I GIT IN THAT ERE HOUSE THAN I BEGINNED TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AND THEN I SEE A HINDIWIDUAL THAT I BEGINNED TO THINK WUR MIGHTY LIKE THAT ERE GHOST AND WHO WAS THAT WHY THAT ERE HANCIENT WIRGIN MISS STAGGLES AH WHAT THEN WELL I HEARD SOMEBODY TELLIN HER AS OW YOU WERE GONE TO LONDON AND I THOUGHT SHE LOOKED MIGHTY PLEASED
I ASKED HIM THE SUBJECT OF THIS SOMETHING PARTICULAR AND HE SAID IT WAS ABOUT THE GHOST
MOREOVER THESE HAVE BEEN SO OFTEN EXPOSED BY CULTURED MEN THAT THEY HAVE NO WEIGHT WITH PEOPLE OF INTELLIGENCE HIS EYES GLEAMED SAVAGELY BUT HE SMILED UPON HER AND SAID PERHAPS I MAY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF UNDECEIVING YOU SOME TIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE MEANWHILE YOU WILL TELL US AN EASTERN STORY SAID ONE OF THE YOUNG LADIES
THUS IT WAS WHILE WE EAGERLY SOUGHT FOR THE MYSTERIOUS POWER I HAVE MENTIONED WE WERE BUOYED UP BY THE HOPE THAT THOUGH WE MIGHT NOT BE SUCCESSFUL ILFRA WOULD REVEAL TO US WHAT WE DESIRED TO KNOW AND THUS THE TIME PASSED ON UNTIL WE REACHED ILFRA'S TWENTY-FIRST BIRTHDAY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SEVEN DAYS
I HAVE IT IN MY POWER NOW TO LODGE YOU SAFE IN A FELON'S GAOL AND BRING YOU TO A HANGMAN'S NOOSE AY AND I WOULD TOO CRIED MISS STAGGLES
MY IDEAS ARE SUCH AS WOULD NOT FIND MUCH FAVOUR IN ORDINARY ENGLISH CIRCLES HE SAID SMILINGLY
SIMON WAS MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE SCENERY
SO HE HAS BEEN TRYING--IS TRYING--TO DRIVE ME AWAY FROM HERE
COULD NOT SOME ONE YOU KNOW AND WHO KNOWS HIM SKETCH A FAITHFUL LIKENESS FROM MEMORY I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY ONE THEN I COULD NOT GUARANTEE TO FIND HIM
NO SOONER HAD I DONE SO THAN HE GAVE A SAVAGE EXULTANT YELL
HE HAD HOWEVER A BIG HEAD A PROMINENT FOREHEAD AND KEEN GREY EYES
STILL THE ART IS NOT ALTOGETHER GONE
EVERYTHING IS MISTY
I DID NOT LIKE EAVESDROPPING OR PLAYING THE SPY AND YET I FELT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT WOULD BE RIGHT TO DO SO AND SURELY THAT TIME HAD COME IN MY HISTORY
YOU SAY MR JUSTIN BLAKE THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHERE KAFFAR IS YET YOU HOLD IN YOUR HAND HIS KNIFE WHICH IS RED WITH BLOOD
THE THOUGHT ALMOST DROVE ME MAD
NO ONE WAS FORTHCOMING
TWO CLEVER MEN WERE AT WORK WHILE THANK GOD I WAS FREE TO ACT AND TO THINK
ARRANGEMENTS HAD BEEN MADE FOR US TO BREAKFAST AT TEN AND THUS BE JUST IN TIME FOR SERVICE AT THE LITTLE VILLAGE CHURCH
IT WILL NOT BE VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO MY WISHES FOR BY SO DOING YOU WILL SET THE WHOLE MACHINERY OF THE LAW OF ENGLAND ON KAFFAR'S TRAIL AND I PROMISE YOU IT WILL FIND HIM
THE LITTLE PROFESSOR HAD GIVEN ME SOME HOPE
IT WAS HELD IN GOOD OLD ENGLISH STYLE AND TO MOST I AM SURE IT WAS VERY ENJOYABLE
IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING I SPENT A PLEASANT EVENING AT TEMPLE HALL
SHE LOOKED PALE AND WORRIED
THAT SHALL NEVER BE
I KNEW HE WAS SEEKING TO EXERT HIS OLD INFLUENCE AND ONCE I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE TO YIELD
THE THREE REMAINING YEARS I HAVE SPENT IN ARABIA SYRIA AND CHALDEA AND DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT WHAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED EXISTS IN REALITY SAID MISS FORREST
YES HE KNEW OF THREE OR FOUR
BUT TWAS NO GO
I WAS INNOCENT IN THOUGHT AND STILL I WAS NOT HELPED
EITHER HE WAS IN LONDON WITH VOLTAIRE OR HE HAD GONE BACK TO EGYPT
I HAD FORGOTTEN THIS PART OF THE PROGRAMME BUT I DETERMINED NOT TO WAIT FOR MY LUGGAGE
WE BELIEVE YOU ARE A WONDERFUL MAN THANK YOU SAID VOLTAIRE
WE ARE CONVINCED THAT YOU ARE A WONDERFUL MAN SHE SAID
SO MUCH WAS THIS SO THAT SHE WAS CALLED ILFRA THE UNDERSTANDING ONE AS THE YEARS WENT ON SHE OUTSTRIPPED HER FATHER AND OBTAINED A KNOWLEDGE OF THAT FOR WHICH HER FATHER HAD UNSUCCESSFULLY STUDIED ALL HIS LIFE
I MUST TELL THEM OF VOLTAIRE'S INFLUENCE OVER ME AND THAT IT WAS PROBABLE I HAD WHILE HELD UNDER A MESMERIST'S SPELL KILLED THE MAN I HAD BEEN TRYING TO FIND
ANYHOW I COULD DO NO MORE AND IT WAS MY ONLY HOPE
DO YOU THINK THAT THE MATTERS TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED EXIST ONLY IN THE MIND
THERE COULD BE NO HARM IN TRYING
BUT HE CHECKED HIMSELF AS IF HE WERE TELLING THE ITALIAN TOO MUCH
THE MOUTH WAS WELL CUT THE LIPS RATHER THIN WHICH OFTEN PARTED REVEALING A SET OF PEARLY WHITE TEETH
AND YET THAT VOLTAIRE IS A TERRIBLE FELLOW
YOU CANNOT--KILL ME--HERE HE GASPED
THE EGYPTIAN STORY WAS ONE THE THOUGHT-READING WAS THE SECOND THE ANIMAL AND MENTAL MAGNETISM WAS THE THIRD
MY IMAGINATION SOARED MY HEART FELT A WONDROUS JOY
YOU ENGLISH PEOPLE HAVE STRONG PREJUDICES AND THUS MY STORY WOULD BE INJURED BY THE NARRATOR NAY VOLTAIRE SAID TOM TEMPLE WE ARE ALL FRIENDLY LISTENERS HERE MY GOOD HOST SAID VOLTAIRE I AM SURE YOU ARE A FRIENDLY LISTENER BUT I HAVE BEEN TELLING OF EASTERN KNOWLEDGE
BUT THERE THAT MAY MEAN NOTHING BUT IT DOES
AND BY THE POWERS OF HIS SOUL LIFE WHICH CAN BE A THOUSAND TIMES STRENGTHENED BY MEANS OF A KNOWLEDGE OF THE FORCES AT THE COMMAND OF ALL HE CAN SUMMON IT BACK TO THE BODY AGAIN
ONLY TEN DAYS WERE WANTING TO CHRISTMAS EVE AND I KNEW NO MORE OF KAFFAR'S WHEREABOUTS THAN I DID ON THE DAY WHEN I DEFIED VOLTAIRE AND STARTED ON MY SEARCH
BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED BEYOND COMPARE AND SO GRAND SO NOBLE
IF YOU PRESUME TO SPEAK TO HER I WILL STOP YOU IN THE ACT
I HAD STAYED THERE BEFORE AND SO I KNEW
MEET HIM AT ST PANCRAS I IMMEDIATELY CAUGHT A CAB AND DROVE TO GOWER STREET AND ON LOOKING AT MY TIME-TABLE I FOUND THAT THE TRAIN MENTIONED IN THE TELEGRAM ARRIVED IN LONDON AT 5.15
BESIDES I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE LONGING FOR OTHER AMUSEMENT THAN STORIES OF THE UNSEEN AS HE SPOKE I SAW HIS EYES TRAVEL TOWARDS ABA WADY KAFFAR AND THEY EXCHANGED GLANCES
ONE FACE WAS EVER BEFORE ME AND I CONSTANTLY WONDERED WHETHER SHE WERE IN REAL DANGER FROM THESE STRANGE MEN AND WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE ANY PART IN THE LABOUR OF DELIVERING HER FROM THEM
I SIMPLY HAPPEN TO HAVE LIVED IN COUNTRIES WHERE THESE MATTERS ARE STUDIED AND AS A CONSEQUENCE HAVE LEARNED SOME OF THEIR MYSTERIES
EVIDENTLY SHE WAS COLD FOR SHE STAMPED HER FEET AGAINST THE WOOD FLOOR WITH GREAT VEHEMENCE
BUT EVEN IF YOU DID NOT IT IS ALL THE SAME
HE TACITLY ADMITTED EVERYTHING
HIS EYES TOO WERE ALMOST BURIED IN THEIR CAVERNOUS SOCKETS AND SHADED BY BUSHY WHITE EYEBROWS
YOU THINK KAFFAR IS TO BE FOUND--WELL WAIT
I FORGOT THE WARNING VOICE BEHIND ME
I KNEW NOTHING WRONG OF THEM
COULD IT BE THAT I HAD MURDERED THIS MAN
YOU ASKED ME FOR LOVE
NO SOONER DID I FEEL MY FREEDOM THAN I WAS NEARLY MAD WITH RAGE
I WILL BE ANSWERED
TRY AS I WOULD I COULD NOT DISPEL THE FANCY THAT SOON SOMETHING TERRIBLE WOULD HAPPEN
AND SURE'S I'M A RIGHT-DOWN COCKNEY HE HATES YOU LIKE PIZEN
MISS STAGGLES MY FRIEND HE SAYS WATCH HER CLOSELY AND MEET ME HERE ON NEW YEAR'S DAY AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
I CONQUERED YOU AND YOU ARE MY SLAVE STILL I DID NOT THINK IT WISE TO REPLY
KAFFAR WAS ALIVE
MOREOVER SHE HAD WILLINGLY CONSENTED TO WALK TO CHURCH WITH ME AND HAD EXPRESSED A DISLIKE FOR THE MAN I IN SPITE OF MYSELF WAS BEGINNING TO FEAR
HI'VE BIN IN THE ARMS O WENUS MYSELF AND KNOWS AS OW A HOUR SLIPS AWAY LIKE A MINNIT
THOSE POSSESSING THEM AND THEREBY HAVING THE POWER TO MESMERIZE MAY SUBJUGATE THE WILL OF THOSE WHO ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MESMERIC INFLUENCES AND HOLD THEM IN A COMPLETE AND TERRIBLE SLAVERY
WHAT IS IT SIMON I SAID
BUT ALTHOUGH TURIN IS BEAUTIFULLY BUILT AND THE STREETS VERY STRAIGHT I FOUND I HAD TO PUT OFF MY SEARCH UNTIL THE MORNING
SHE HAD NO HUSBAND
I AM AN OLD FRIEND AND SCHOOLFELLOW OF EMILY TEMPLE WHILE YOU I AM TOLD ARE AN OLD FRIEND AND SCHOOLFELLOW OF HER BROTHER
ONE VOICE ONLY WAS HEARD AND THAT WAS THE EGYPTIAN'S
YOU MUST LEAVE TEMPLE HALL
GOOD-BYE FOR THE TIME
THE STORY I HAVE TO TELL RELATES TO THAT PART OF THE WORLD
SO I TOLD HER I DID AND THEN--WELL WHAT FOLLOWED WAS PERFECTLY SATISFACTORY I CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS AUDACITY AND THEN WE SPENT THE NIGHT IN WANDERING ABOUT THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE TRYING TO FIND THE GHOST BUT IN VAIN
WHAT NEXT TOM I CRIED EAGERLY
I HAVE MET NEARLY ALL THE YOUNG LADIES BUT ONLY TWO OF THE GENTLEMEN--MR VOLTAIRE AND MR KAFFAR
A PASSIONATE LOVE FOR LITERATURE WHICH LED ME TO MAKE IT MY PROFESSION
A LOOK OF ANNOYANCE SWEPT ACROSS HER FACE AS IF SHE COULD HAVE VERY COMFORTABLY EXCUSED HER PRESENCE
YOU PROMISED YOU WOULD SAID ANOTHER
THUS NOTHING IS MORE NATURAL THAN THAT WE SHOULD BE INVITED TO SUCH A GATHERING AS THIS DO YOU KNOW ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE I ASKED
SAY HE CAME BACK ON TUESDAY BY NOON THERE WOULD THEN BE ONLY THIRTY-SIX HOURS LEFT IN WHICH TO GET TO LONDON
WHAT A POOR AFFAIR IT IS
NO DOUBT THE READER WILL SMILE AT MY ATTEMPTS AS A PRIVATE DETECTIVE BUT REALIZING THE CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH I WAS SURROUNDED THERE MAY BE SOME EXCUSE FOR MY UNBUSINESSLIKE WAY OF GOING TO WORK
NO NO MR BLAKE SHE CRIED
WAS HE HERE NOW--TO HELP TO SAVE
ORDINARILY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED BY IT
AND HER NAME HER NAME SAID TOM SLOWLY IS EDITH GRAY I GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF
IF I HAVE CLAIMED A KNOWLEDGE OF THE MYSTERIOUS I HAVE NOT DONE SO WITHOUT REASON WE BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE SAID MISS STAGGLES
HA JUSTIN CRIED TOM WE DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE YOU JUST YET SURELY SOMETHING'S THE MATTER OH NO I REPLIED WHEN LOOKING AT HEROD VOLTAIRE I SAW A GHASTLY SMILE WREATHE HIS LIPS AND THEN I FELT MY BURDEN GONE
THE WATERS MOVED
EVIDENTLY HOWEVER THE YOUNGER LADY WAS NOT DELIGHTED AT THE ADVENT OF THE ELDER
IF YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME WORD OF HOPE A BEAUTIFUL LOOK LIT UP HER EYES
THE WONDER WAS HOW WE GOT TO PARIS SO SOON WHEN WE CONSIDERED WHAT HAD TO BE CONTENDED WITH
OF COURSE I CAN ONLY HINT AT THESE THINGS HERE AS ONLY THE INITIATED CAN UNDERSTAND THESE SECRET LAWS
IT IS TOO SACRED A SUBJECT TO PARADE
HOW CAN HE HELP US EVIDENTLY HE IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO MESMERIC INFLUENCES AND HE KNOWS THE MAN YOU WISH TO FIND
I AM AN EASTERN
IT WAS A WONDROUS SCENE
I HAVE HEARD THAT MR BLAKE HAS ATTEMPTED TO WRITE A NOVEL SAID VOLTAIRE
DESCRIPTIVE OF ITS TEACHING
I WOULD GO BACK TO ENGLAND
THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WALKED TOGETHER AND TALKED TOGETHER WHILE THE MATRONS LOOKED COMPLACENTLY ON
HE WAS EXCITED AND SCARCELY KNEW WHAT WAS BEST TO DO
HE FIXED HIS TERRIBLE EYE UPON ME AND SAID SLOWLY AND DISTINCTLY JUSTIN BLAKE RESISTANCE IS USELESS
IF THE EGYPTIAN STOPS ANYWHERE IN ITALY IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO REACH HIM AND BRING HIM BACK WITHIN THE TIME YOU MENTION
I AM GOING TO SHOW SHE SAID THAT I BELIEVE MR BLAKE INNOCENT
I COULD NOT FIND THE EGYPTIAN AND THUS IT WAS PROBABLE I HAD KILLED HIM AS HAD BEEN SAID
AND YET I WAS TO LOSE HER AND THAT MAN--A FIEND IN HUMAN FORM--WAS TO WED HER
SLEPT LIKE THE SEVEN SLEEPERS OF THE PATRIARCH SUR ALL THE WAY FROM LEEDS AND YOU DON'T FEEL TIRED NOW NOT A BIT YER HONOUR THEN I SAID I WANT TO EXPLAIN TO YOU A FEW THINGS THAT MUST HAVE APPEARED STRANGE ACCORDINGLY I TOLD HIM OF VOLTAIRE'S INFLUENCE OVER ME AND WHAT CAME OUT OF IT
TO SEARCH OUT ALL THE GAMBLING-HOUSES IN PARIS WOULD BE A HOPELESS TASK
IT WAS IF POSSIBLE MORE QUIET THAN THE ONE FROM WHICH I HAD JUST COME
I'M FEELING SHAKY BUT I SHAN'T MIND A BIT IF YOU'LL LET SIMON REMAIN WITH ME AND SO TOM LEFT ME WITH SIMON
MY LIFE IS A MYSTERY AND AT TIMES A TERROR BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF KAFFAR NO MORE THAN THAT DOG BARKING IN THE YARD
IT WAS JOY AND LIGHT TO ME AND I NEEDED IT IN THE DARK DAYS THAT CAME AFTER
HE DID NOT KEEP AN HOTEL REGISTER
NOW GO AND BEAR THIS IN MIND THAT THE RIGHT AND THE TRUTH SHALL BE TRIUMPHANT I RUNG THE BELL AS I SPOKE AND THE SERVANT APPEARED
I HOPE YOUR SOLITARY WALK IS PLEASANT HE SAID REVEALING HIS WHITE TEETH
I INQUIRED AT THE CASINO--WITHOUT SUCCESS
WHILE I WITHOUT KNOWING WHY PREPARED TO START FOR LONDON
IF THERE SHOULD BE A BREAKDOWN OR IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO HINDER US
EVER SINCE MAY ENDEAVOURS HAVE BEEN MADE TO TRACK HIM BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS PERHAPS HE IS DEAD SAID THE PROFESSOR
LET US JOIN THE OTHERS I STAMMERED WITH DIFFICULTY AND RODE AWAY WITHOUT WAITING FOR HER CONSENT
I SPENT A YEAR IN CAIRO TWO MORE UP BY THE BANKS OF THE NILE AMONG THE RUINS OF ANCIENT CITIES WHERE IN SPITE OF THE DEGRADATION THAT EXISTS THERE IS STILL TO BE FOUND THOSE WHO HAVE SOME OF THE WISDOM OF PAST AGES
THEN TRY AND MOVE FROM YOUR PRESENT POSITION I HAD BEEN LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND TRIED TO MOVE
HE EVIDENTLY FELT THAT HE WAS THE STRONGEST INFLUENCE IN THE ROOM--THAT ALL HAD TO YIELD TO HIM AS THEIR SUPERIOR
AT THIS THERE WAS A TITTER AMONG THE YOUNG LADIES
IT WAS TERRIBLY COLD THERE
WHEN I TOOK THE LAST TRICK YOU BECAME MINE--MINE BODY AND SOUL I STILL DEFIED HIM AND LAUGHED SCORNFULLY INTO HIS FACE
I HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN I MET VOLTAIRE
BUT THEN YOU KNOW THE OLD ADAGE NEEDS MUST WHEN THE DEVIL DRIVES AND SO YOU'VE ADMITTED YOUR IDENTITY I SAID
OF COURSE I WAS NOT SURE BUT THIS WAS STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF HIS BEING ALIVE
STILL I THINK WE HAVE DONE A FAIR MORNING'S WORK
I HAD ARRANGED MY DOOR TO BE SLIGHTLY AJAR SO WAS ABLE TO SEE
AH SWEET LADY I DARE NOT TELL
I'VE PLAYED IN AMLET YER HONOUR ALONG WITH OCTAVIUS BUMPUS'S TRAVELLIN THEATRE AND I CAN NAIL A MADE-UP LIVIN GHOST IN A MINNIT
I FELT THAT LIFE AND LOVE OF LIBERTY WERE STRONG IN ME AND I DETERMINED THAT THOUGH I MIGHT BE CONQUERED IT SHOULD NOT BE WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
WE WANT TO KNOW ALL
THEN TURNING MY HORSE'S HEAD TOWARDS DREARWATER POND I GALLOPED AWAY
EACH MINUTE MY SURROUNDINGS BECAME MORE REAL
I WENT AWAY THEN AND BEGAN TO THINK
I PUT ON MY OVERCOAT AND WALKED TO SCOTLAND YARD
VOLTAIRE IS ON THE CONTINENT
KAFFAR IF HE WERE ALIVE MIGHT BE IN AFRICA AUSTRALIA--NO ONE KNEW WHERE
THEN--AH I AM AN EASTERN AND CANNOT GIVE UP EVERYTHING
THERE WERE NO HOUSES NEAR AND THE HIGH-ROAD WAS SOME DISTANCE AWAY
THEN YOU COULD MANAGE EASILY I CANNOT
NONE OF THE ENGLISH GUESTS SPOKE WHEN VOLTAIRE STOPPED A SECOND IN HIS NARRATION
THEN A STRANGE LIGHT LIT UP HIS EYES
MR KAFFAR SAYS HE CAN GUESS WHO THE PERSON IS WHO HAS PERSONATED THIS GHOST SHE SAID
I RESOLVED TO DO ALL THAT WAS TO BE DONE MYSELF
WHEN I LEFT SHORTLY AFTER I ASKED WHETHER I SHOULD COME THE NEXT DAY OR RATHER WHEN DAYLIGHT CAME AND SPEND CHRISTMAS DAY WITH HER
FACT SUR I'VE BEGUN TO THINK FOR THE FUST TIME AS OW SOME THINGS IN THE BIBLE AIN'T TRUE
AND YET I CAN DO NOTHING YOU CAN DO SOMETHING
WHEN I CAME ALL WAS SILENT
NO GHASTLY DEED TAUNTED ME WITH ITS MEMORY NO DARK CLOUD HUNG IN THE SKIES
IT WOULD BE WELL IF IT COULD BE DONE
YOU WILL SEE HE WENT ON THAT I HAVE NOT TOUCHED HIM AND YET HE IS NO LONGER CONSCIOUS
YES WAS THE REPLY
IN SUCH A LIFE AS MINE THERE ARE NATURALLY THINGS THAT I DO NOT WISH KNOWN
WELL I THINK I'VE MADE THEM COMFORTABLE SO I DON'T MIND SO MUCH YOU'RE A CAPITAL HOST TOM I SAID
I DESPISE THE FOOLISH THINGS WHICH THESE QUACKS OF MESMERISM MAKE BILLY PEOPLE DO IN ORDER TO PLEASE A GAPING-MOUTHED AUDIENCE
I HAD BEEN TO TURIN AND REMEMBERED SOME OF THE PLACES THE SKETCH INDICATED
A YOUNG ITALIAN GIRL STOOD BEHIND THE COUNTER AS IF WAITING FOR AN ORDER
THAT YOU SWORE TO BE REVENGED
TO ME IT WAS DRAWING IT TERRIBLY FINE BUT I CONSENTED
ONE OF THE SHEIKS OF A VILLAGE THAT LAY BURIED AMONG PALM TREES WAS DEEPLY VERSED IN THE THINGS I LONGED TO KNOW AND WITH HIM I TOOK UP MY ABODE
I HAD SCARCELY SLEPT THROUGH THE NIGHT AND ANXIOUSLY AWAITED THE APPEARANCE OF THE TRAIN
IT WAS BECOME INTENSELY REAL INTENSELY EXCITING
VOLTAIRE GAVE A YELL LIKE THAT OF A MAD DOG WHILE MISS FORREST GAVE A SCREAM OF DELIGHT
THE PROMISE OF A LADY IS EVER IRREVOCABLE SHE SAID
AND NOT LIKIN TO GO GIN PROVIDENCE I AXED HER TO CHANGE HER NAME TO SLOWDEN WELL SIMON WHAT WAS HER REPLY SHE SEED THE FORCE O MY REASONIN'S IN A MINUTE AND SO AS YOU MAY SAY THERE'LL BE GOOD BROUGHT OUT O EVIL EVEN THE EVIL O WACCINATIN
NOW SAID VOLTAIRE I TOLD YOU THAT BY A SECRET POWER HIS MIND AND MINE BECAME ONE
AS THE DAYS AND WEEKS PASSED AWAY THINGS BECAME WORSE
I LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND I SAW A STRANGE INTEREST MANIFESTED EXCEPT IN THE FACE OF THE EGYPTIAN
I HAD NOT BEEN IN TEMPLE HALL TWO HOURS BEFORE THAT MAN HAD MARKED ME AS ONE THAT HE WOULD FAIN BE RID OF INDEED SHE SAID
I WAS ASKED MY OPINION AND I GAVE IT I WATCHED MR VOLTAIRE'S FACE AS I SPOKE
THE FIRST OF DECEMBER HAD COME AND I WAS NOT A STEP NEARER FINDING THE MAN WHOSE PRESENCE WOULD FREE ME FROM VOLTAIRE'S VILLAINOUS CHARGE
NAY MORE THAN THAT I WILL MAKE YOU ACT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE YOU TO HER AN OBJECT OF DERISION BUT I SAID IF YOU POSSESS SUCH A POWER OVER ME WHICH I DO NOT ADMIT I WILL PROCLAIM TO EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE THE VILLAINOUS MEANS BY WHICH YOU HAVE POSSESSED IT
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD JOURNEY SIMON I ASKED
THEY'VE BEEN RIDING TOGETHER AGAIN TO-DAY I GUESSED IT
IT WAS MY DUTY AT ALL HAZARDS TO FREE GERTRUDE FORREST FROM VOLTAIRE
THAT IS BECAUSE I NEVER SAW A WOMAN IN WHOM I WAS SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED TO COURT HER SOCIETY
I COULD NOT TELL AND YET A STRANGE LOOK OF INTELLIGENCE FLASHED FROM HER EYES
WE WERE TOO ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER THE SECRETS OF THE DEAD WERE TO BE REVEALED
I WAS SURE TOO THAT SHE LIKED ME
DIFFICULTY LAUGHED TOM
MR TOM TEMPLE HAD FORMED THEIR ACQUAINTANCE SOMEHOW AND SEEMED WONDERFULLY FASCINATED BY THEM
WE CANNOT DESCRIBE IN WORDS THE YEARNINGS AND EXPERIENCES OF THE SOUL
IT WILL NOT ONLY SATISFY MY TASTE BUT GIVE ME POWER AND POWER IS WHAT I MUST HAVE
THEN HER WORDS CAME BACK TO ME AND HER PURE INFLUENCE GAVE ME STRENGTH
BUT BAH
BUT BAH
FOR A MINUTE HE STOOD AS IF IRRESOLUTE
YOU DAR'N'T FIGHT
I CANNOT AFFORD TO LET ANYTHING PASS WITHOUT EXAMINING IT
WHEN WE GOT TO THE FRENCH METROPOLIS WE WERE NEARLY FIVE HOURS LATE
WHAT THAT SECRET WAS I WILL NOT TELL
I LAUGHED IN HIS FACE AS IF I SCORNED HIS BOASTED STRENGTH
YOU WILL BE THANKFUL GERTRUDE FORREST SOME DAY THAT I DO CARE FOR YOU MISS STAGGLES CONTINUED ALTHOUGH I NEVER EXPECT TO GET ANY REWARD FOR MY KINDNESS BY THIS TIME THE TRAIN WAS GOING RAPIDLY AND SO LOUD WAS THE ROAR IT MADE THAT I HEARD ONLY THE GROWLING OF MISS STAGGLES VOICE WITHOUT DISTINGUISHING ANY WORDS
I GAVE AN AWFUL SCREAM AND THEN I SUPPOSE I FAINTED THIS STORY WAS TOLD WITH MANY INTERRUPTIONS MANY PAUSES MANY CRIES AND I SAW THAT THE FACES OF THOSE AROUND WERE BLANCHED WITH FEAR
I LEAVE THIS HOUSE HE SAID WILDLY
AH HE IS A CLEVER MAN BUT I ASKED ANXIOUSLY CAN YOU TELL ME KAFFAR'S WHEREABOUTS NOW NO I CANNOT--THAT IS NOT TO-DAY WHEN THEN I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO AT ALL
IF HE WAS IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD FOUND HIM OUT THIS MAN IS MAD I SAID
EACH OF US HAD REPAIRED TO HIS ROOM AND MOST I EXPECT WERE QUIETLY ASLEEP WHEN A TERRIBLE SCREAM WAS HEARD AFTER WHICH THERE WERE SHOUTS FOR HELP AND HYSTERICAL CRIES
THE OFTENER THE VICTIM YIELDS TO THE WILL OF THE MESMERIST THE STRONGER WILL HIS POWER BECOME
OR PERHAPS ONE OF THEIR FELLOW-SERVANTS SOUGHT TO PLAY THEM A TRICK AND RAN AWAY WHEN THEY SAW WHAT THEY HAD DONE
HE SAT DOWN AS IF IN ASTONISHMENT
JUST SO AND YOU WILL BE MORE THAN SORRY
EVIDENTLY THE GUESTS WERE AS YET STRANGERS TO EACH OTHER AND WERE ONLY GRADUALLY WEARING AWAY THE RESTRAINT THAT NATURALLY EXISTED
ACTING UPON SUDDEN IMPULSE WHICH I THINK WAS CAUSED BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE MEANING GLANCES THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM AFTER VOLTAIRE HAD LOOKED AT MISS FORREST I FOLLOWED THEM OUT INTO THE SILENT NIGHT
WHEN I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS I FOUND ONLY ABOU AND HELFA THERE
INDEED I HAD FROM PRINCIPLE AVOIDED THE SOCIETY OF LADIES THAT IS WHEN THEY WERE OF THE FLIRTABLE OR MARRIAGEABLE KIND
YOU GET MARRIED TO ME SAYS I AND YOU'LL BE KEPT FREE FROM SMALL-POX WITHOUT GOIN THREW THIS YER WILLIFYIN PROCESS WI THAT SHE LOOKS AT ME AND SHE SAYS YOU ARE PURTY AND I'LL TRY YOU FOR THREE MONTHS
BUT I DID NOT TROUBLE FOR WAS NOT GERTRUDE FORREST NEAR ME AND DID WE NOT HAVE DELIGHTFUL CONVERSATION TOGETHER
YOU WILL NOT LEAVE US SO EASILY
NEVERTHELESS KAFFAR HAS NOT GONE WITHOUT LEAVING A FRIEND BEHIND HIM AND YOU WILL HAVE TO SHOW HOW YOU CAME BY THAT"--POINTING TO THE KNIFE WHICH I HAD DROPPED WITH A SHUDDER
THERE WAS MUCH IN MY FAVOUR
SEND SIMON SLOWDEN TO ME AT ONCE I TELEGRAPHED
THE BODY OF ILFRA HAD BEEN REMOVED WHERE I KNOW NOT FOR I NEVER SAW IT AGAIN
I WAS UNSUCCESSFUL UNTIL I CAME TO BRINDISI
HUGE COLUMNS AROSE IN THE AIR SURMOUNTED BY COLOSSAL ARCHITRAVES WHILE THE PONDEROUS STONES OF WHICH THE TEMPLE WAS BUILT WERE COVERED WITH LICHEN
I'M ENSLAVED AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW
THIS WAS PARTICULARLY REMEMBERED--FIRST BECAUSE THE FOREIGN GENTLEMAN SEEMED VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT IT AND SECOND BECAUSE THERE SEEMED TO BE NOTHING IN IT
IF THERE IS A GOD EVIL WOULD BE CHECKED DESTROYED
I WILL MARRY THE WOMAN YOU LOVE AND THEN I WILL LEAD YOU SUCH A LIFE AS YOU NEVER CONCEIVED
THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES WHICH SEEMED TO HANG OVER MY HEAD POSSESSED NO TERROR
AS NICE A CHAP AS YOU EVER SEE I SAID THOUGH I AM MARKED WI SMALL-POX
NOW SIMON SAID TOM TEMPLE THIS GENTLEMAN IS A SCIENTIST AND WANTS TO SHOW SOME EXPERIMENTS AND HE CAN'T GET ANY ONE TO ASSIST HIM SO I THOUGHT I'D ASK YOU WELL SAID SIMON I DON'T KNOW AS I THINK MICH ON THESE SCIENCE GENTS
THEY BE FILLIN ME FASTER N I CAN DISPOSE OF EM
HE STARED AT ME AS IF IN WONDER AND A CURIOUS LIGHT PLAYED IN HIS EYES
NO YOUNG LADY SHOULD TRAVEL ALONE
I COULD NOT SEE A STEP BEFORE ME
HE'LL NIBBLE LIKE HANYTHING WAS THE ANSWER AND THEN I HEARN A NASTY SORT O LAUGH
IS THAT ALL TOM I SAID AT LENGTH
IF HE FAILS--WELL I HAVE ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE MAY I KNOW WHAT NO NOT NOW ANSWER ME THIS
HER LIPS WERE COMPRESSED AND HER EYES HAD A STRANGE LOOK
ONLY TEN DAYS
ONLY TEN DAYS
CAN YOU GIVE ME TEN MINUTES BEFORE DINNER SUR HE SAID
AS I BEFORE HINTED ILFRA THE UNDERSTANDING ONE HAD FOUND OUT THE SECRET
IF I REMEMBER ARIGHT YER HONOUR HE SAID I TOLD YOU AS OW I'D COMPLETELY FINISHED WI ALL BELONGIN TO THE FEMALE PERSUASION YOU DID SIMON WELL I'VE CHANGED MY MIND
FOR EXAMPLE THE EFFECT OF MIND UPON MIND ANIMAL MAGNETISM MESMERISM BIOLOGY AND KINDRED SUBJECTS ARE UNKNOWN TO YOU
AND THEN AS KAFFAR CAME UP BY HIS SIDE MY STRENGTH WAS GONE MY HANDS DROPPED BY MY SIDE AND UNHEEDING THE CYNICAL LEER OF THE EGYPTIAN OR THE TERRIBLE LOOK OF HIS FRIEND I WALKED INTO THE HOUSE LIKE ONE IN A DREAM
IT TURNED MY MIND INTO A NEW CHANNEL
I FOUND ALSO THAT MR SMITH WAS ACTUALLY REPRESENTED THERE IN THE SHAPE OF A SMALL BOY A DOZEN NOVELS AND A FEW NEWSPAPERS
I'LL NO SAY HE HAS THE GIFT O SECOND SIGHT PROPERLY SHE SAID BUT HE'LL FEEL IN A MINUTE WHAT IT'LL TAK SOOM FOWK YEARS TO FIN OUT
PERHAPS SOME MAY THINK THIS CONCLUSION TO BE BUILT ON A VERY INSUFFICIENT FOUNDATION NEVERTHELESS I FELT SURE THAT SUCH WAS THE CASE
COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE HE IS I SAID WITH BEATING HEART
SURELY HE OUGHT TO BE SHUT UP MAD AM I HE SHRIEKED
SUCH WAS SIMON'S INFORMATION
I WANTED TO INVESTIGATE THE WHOLE MATTER
YOU SHALL SUFFER AS NEVER MAN SUFFERED
I WILL NOT CAUSE A RIPPLE ON THE EVEN STREAM OF YOUR LIFE
I SCARCELY SPOKE TO THEM HOWEVER AS I LEFT GERMANY THE NEXT DAY AND WAS RATHER SURPRISED TO SEE THEM HERE LAST NIGHT MR VOLTAIRE IS A VERY FASCINATING MAN I SUGGESTED
A FULLER RICHER LIFE SURGED WITHIN ME ENABLING ME TO RISE ABOVE THE OCCULT FORCES OF OUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL NATURES
YOU HAVE LIVED IN THE EAST SAID MISS FORREST EVIDENTLY FASCINATED BY THE STRANGE TALK
MR KAFFAR IS NOT IN TURIN AT PRESENT HE SAID CONFIDENTIALLY
WITH US IT IS DIFFERENT
DINNER PASSED OVER WITHOUT ANYTHING WORTHY OF NOTE BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS OVER WE HURRIED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM
TO USE YOU AS I DID WAS KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU JUSTIN SAID TOM AS I JOINED THEM
YES MISS EMERY HE SAID I THINK EUROPEAN EDUCATION IS POOR IS ONE-SIDED
EACH TIME THE FORMER ASKED WHAT THE ARTICLE WAS AND EACH TIME THE LATTER ALTHOUGH AT A DISTANCE CORRECTLY DESCRIBED IT
EARLY THE NEXT DAY WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO ENGLAND SIMON AND I TAKING TURNS IN WATCHING THE WILY EGYPTIAN
I SAW NO HOPE
WHY I THOUGHT SHOULD I FOLLOW THESE MEN
THE EGYPTIAN BORE THE NAME OF THE MAN I WANTED TO FIND
ANY LITTLE THING MIGHT GIVE A CLUE TO THE MYSTERY I SOUGHT SIMON IN THE STABLE-YARD AND FOUND HIM AS GRIM AND PLATONIC AS EVER
AND YET I SEEMED TO BE BEATING THE AIR
I LOOKED HOUT FOR YER HONOUR ALL DAY YESTERDAY HE SAID BUT YOU LAY LIKE A HARE IN A FURZE BUSH
HOW WHY YER SEE YER HONOUR AFTER THE DOCTOR EXPERIMENTED ON ME BY WACCINATIN ME AGIN SMALL-POX CHOLERA AND THE MEASLES TOGETHER WI OOPIN COUGH AND SEVERAL OTHER BABY COMPLAINTS AS EV A HINJURIOUS EFFECT UPON PEOPLE AS EV CUT THEIR WISDOM TEETH YOU KNOW AS I TOLD YER HONOUR THAT I CAUGHT THAT ERE WERRY DISEASE OF SMALL-POX WHICH SPILED MY BEAUTY FOR EVER
TIME AFTER TIME ON OUR HOMEWARD JOURNEY DID I CONTRIVE TO BE ALONE WITH MISS FORREST BUT ALWAYS IN VAIN
THE LIVING DEAD WAS TOO TERRIBLE FOR ME AND I FELL SENSELESS TO THE GROUND
MY LIFE IS GIVEN UP TO YOU
HE HAD NO LUGGAGE AND WHAT MADE THE PORTER IN ATTENDANCE REMEMBER HIM SO VIVIDLY WAS THE FACT OF HIS BEING ANGRY WHEN ASKED IF HE HAD ANY LUGGAGE TO BE LABELLED
COUNTERFEITS PROVE REALITY SAID VOLTAIRE LOOKING SEARCHINGLY AT HER
SO AS THERE WUR NO TELLIN IF YOU WOULD GET TO THE SUMMER-HOUSE TO-NIGHT AT FIVE O'CLOCK I THOUGHT I'D JUST TODDLE UP MYSELF
ANY PARTICULAR GUEST TOM I ASKED
SAID HE COULDN'T KEEP A SERVANT AS WOULD BE A LIVIN ADVERTISEMENT AS OW HIS PET OBBY WER A FAILURE
VOLTAIRE WHO HAD BEEN CLOSELY WATCHED WAS APPARENTLY LIVING A QUIET HARMLESS LIFE AND WAS NOT SO FAR AS COULD BE SEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH HIM
I HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS A WOMAN-HATER A SOCIETY-AVOIDER
THE FAULT HAS GENERALLY BEEN WITH THE LADIES
BEGGIN YER PARDON SAID SIMON BUT THIS ERE WACCINATION BUSINESS IS AWFULLY WEARYIN AND I SHOULD LIKE TO--THAT IS THE VERY THING I REPLIED ANTICIPATING HIS REQUEST
THEN I CAME BACK AND COOLLY SAT DOWN AGAIN
AND POSSESSING A KEEN SENSE OF HUMOUR SHE SAW ENJOYMENT IN THAT WHICH TO MANY WOULD BE COMMONPLACE
I WAS BUSY JIST THEN SO I DIDN'T GO TO THE PLANTATION TILL TWAS DUSK
I AM STAYING AT THE HOTEL TROMBETTA YES YES I SHALL BE DELIGHTED
THE HALL LADY SHE SAID FEARFULLY
PROOF CRIED VOLTAIRE
WHY WHAT HAVE I DONE I SAID IN A DAZED KIND OF A WAY
THAT'S A TOWN IN ITALY SOME DISTANCE BEYOND THE FRENCH BORDER THE PROFESSOR BECKONED ME TO BE QUIET
HE DID NOT REMEMBER HIS NAME
IF I MISTAKE NOT THIS EGYPTIAN GENTLEMAN IS ACQUAINTED WITH A MAN IN ENGLAND WHOM I KNOW AND I HAVE A MESSAGE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO CONVEY TO MR KAFFAR'S ADVANTAGE ASKED THE ITALIAN EAGERLY
HE OFTEN SOUGHT TO TURN A LAUGH AGAINST ME
IN GOING TO MY OLD HAUNTS TRYING TO UNEARTH KAFFAR YOU WOULD LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THEM
HE ONLY MADE A MISTAKE IN ONE THING AND THAT HE THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD EVER BE FREED FROM HIS POWER WITHOUT HIS CONSENT
IT MUST BE EIGHT MILES FURTHER ON
SURELY IF A MAN SHOULD AVOID HIM A WOMAN SHOULD DO SO A THOUSAND TIMES MORE
A MESMERIST'S SPELL XIV
OUR SCIENCE WHICH IS REALLY THE QUEEN OF SCIENCES IS DISREGARDED
THEY WERE PLACED VERY CLOSE TOGETHER AND THE BRIDGE OF THE NOSE BEING NARROW THEY APPEARED SOMETIMES AS IF ONLY ONE EYE LOOKED UPON YOU
THEN THERE WAS THE TERRIBLE SPELL THAT THIS MAN HAD CAST UPON ME
ONCE I THOUGHT OF TELEGRAPHING AND TELLING OF MY SUCCESS BUT I REFRAINED FROM THAT
IT WAS NOT AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE FOR SEVERAL REASONS
AGAIN THERE WAS DEATHLY SILENCE IN THE ROOM AND ALL EYES WERE TURNED TOWARDS VOLTAIRE WHO HAD WALKED CLOSE TO SIMON SLOWDEN
HOW DARE HE
I TRIED TO MOVE BUT COULD NOT
I WAS NO LONGER ALONE AND DESOLATE
YOU LOOK STRANGE WELL WELL I REMEMBER SAYING
LET THEM REMEMBER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE STORY AS I HAVE RELATED THEM LET THEM THINK OF HOW MUCH DEPENDED ON MY DISCOVERY OF KAFFAR LET THEM ALSO TRY TO FANCY SOMETHING OF MY FEELINGS AND THEN THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GUESS AT MY WEARY NIGHTS AND ANXIOUS DAYS THEY WILL KNOW HOW FEVERISHLY I HURRIED FROM PORT TO PORT AND FROM TOWN TO TOWN
AT LENGTH THE CAB STOPPED
BUT IF IT'S FOR YOU SUR--WHY HERE GOES
I LOVE YOU NOW WITH ALL MY SOUL SHE LOOKED AT MY FACE STEADILY BUT DID NOT SPEAK A WORD
I ASKED TO SEE THE STATION-MASTER
IF THERE IS ONE THING FOR WHICH I HAVE AVERSION AND CONTEMPT IT IS FOR FLIRTING COQUETRY AND THE LIKE
EVIL WAS RAMPANT
YOU MUST PROVE YOURSELF TO BE INNOCENT TO DO THAT I MUST BRING THIS MAN KAFFAR
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING FOR WHICH I CAN GIVE UP MY SCHEME OF VENGEANCE TELL ME WHAT IT IS SHE CRIED
BUT I AM NOT A HARD MASTER
JUST SO
HIS ANSWER WAS A BEAMING SMILE AND A FEW WORDS SAYING THAT KNOWLEDGE SHOULD NEVER BE BOASTED OF
THE TRAIN IS NOW DUE SIR THAT GOES THERE AND IT STOPS AT THE NEXT STATION OH YES SIR I BOOKED IMMEDIATELY FOR IT AND IN A FEW MINUTES ARRIVED THERE
SHE IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT OF THE SHOP AND GAVE A SHOUT AND A MINUTE AFTER A MATRONLY WOMAN ENTERED ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE AND WHO FROM HER CLOSE RESEMBLANCE TO THE DARK-EYED GIRL WAS PROBABLY HER MOTHER
IT IS FOR ME YOU HAVE PLACED YOURSELF IN THIS POSITION WHILE I REFUSE TO TRY TO LIBERATE YOU FROM IT
I WAS TOO ANXIOUS TO TURN DOWN THE STREET IN WHICH MY HOPES LAY
I AM SURE I HAVE MISS STAGGLES SYMPATHIES BUT WILL SOME ONE ASSIST ME IN WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DO
NEARING THE END XIX
BUT BEFORE I GO I WOULD LIKE TO FIGHT HAND TO HAND WITH THAT GIANT WHO--HA HE STOOD CLOSE TO ME AND SPAT AT ME
WHEN YOU REALIZE THIS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FORM SOME IDEA OF HOW I FELT
A FELON'S CELL
ALTOGETHER IF YOU WILL COME AND HELP US
ONE ASPECT OF THAT KNOWLEDGE IS THAT THE LEARNED CAN READ THE MINDS THE THOUGHTS OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY COME INTO CONTACT THE LADIES BEGAN TO EXPRESS AN INTENSE DESIRE TO HEAR A STORY OF MAGIC AND MYSTERY AND TO ASSURE HIM THAT HIS NAME WAS A DELIGHTFUL ONE
PERHAPS HE'S LEARNED IT LATELY
I WILL NOW ASK HIM ANY QUESTION CONCERNING EITHER THE DEAD OR THE LIVING THAT YOU MAY BE INCLINED TO ASK I WILL ASK A TEST QUESTION SAID GERTRUDE FORREST
SURELY THERE MUST BE SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO CAUSE YOU ALL TO AROUSE US IN THIS WAY I'LL TELL YOU AS WELL AS I CAN SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER BUT I CAN HARDLY BEAR TO THINK ABOUT IT
WERE I IN EGYPT MY VENGEANCE WOULD BE SPEEDY HE SAID HIS LIGHT EYES GLITTERING
THEY SAY THAT LIKE OTHER OLD HOUSES TEMPLE HALL HAS ITS GHOST HE SAID
MEANWHILE SIMON HAD PAID THE CABBY AND SO THE THREE OF US STOOD TOGETHER IN THE HALL
YOU HAVE DARED TO LEAVE LONDON
BUT I CAN'T TELL NO FACES
THIS SECOND SLEEP WILL ENABLE HIM TO SEE MORE CLEARLY TO-MORROW
IS THAT OLD WOMAN TO BE IN THIS CARRIAGE WITH ME FOR FIVE OR SIX LONG HOURS
NEITHER OF US SAW KAFFAR NOR DID WE HEAR ANYTHING OF HIM
WERE I YOU I SHOULD HAVE NO FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIM
YOU DID COME TO ME THIS MORNING WITH SOME FOOLISH JARGON ABOUT MY BEING CONNECTED WITH LAST NIGHT'S AFFAIR BUT I WAS SO SURPRISED BY THE ABSURDITY AND FOOLISHNESS OF SUCH A THING THAT I COULD NOT ANSWER YOU BEFORE YOU RAN AWAY YOU HEAR SHRIEKED THE EGYPTIAN
WHEN OUR CONVERSATION CEASED I FELT SURE OF ONE THING
LIKE YOU I THINK THERE MUST BE A MISTAKE
BUT SINCE I CANNOT HAVE LOVE I MUST HAVE REVENGE HE WENT ON WRITING WHILE MISS FORREST CLASPED HER HANDS AS IF IN PRAYER
THE PARTY EVIDENTLY FORGOT MESMERISM AND THOUGHT-READING AND SEEMINGLY ENJOYED THEMSELVES WITHOUT ITS ASSISTANCE
MR TEMPLE TELLS ME YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL ME ABOUT THE GHOST
PRESENTLY I HEARD VOICES AT THE LIBRARY DOOR AND IMMEDIATELY MISS FORREST'S KINDNESS AND CHEERFULNESS VANISHED AND THOSE WHO ENTERED THE ROOM MUST HAVE FANCIED THAT I WAS ANNOYING HER WITH MY COMPANY
EVERYTHING'S BEEN DONE CRIED I
IF YOU CANNOT FIND THE EGYPTIAN HE WILL MARRY MISS FORREST AND AFTER THAT--WELL ALL SEEMS HOPELESS IT SHALL NOT BE HOPELESS I SAID
I AM AFRAID WE CAN DO NO MORE TO-NIGHT HE SAID
NO WORDS WOULD COME
IF THE YEAR IS TO BE GOOD TO THOSE WITHIN AT THE TIME SHE COMES WITH FLOWERS AND DRESSED IN GAY ATTIRE
I SHOULD LIKE TO ENTER QUIETLY AND GIVE HIM A SURPRISE YOU MEAN NOTHING WRONG ON MY HONOUR I DO NOT IT IS SAID MUSED THE ITALIAN THAT AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN'S HONOUR IS LIKE ENGLISH CLOTH
THE WAITERS IN THE HOTELS LOLLED AROUND WITH LITTLE OR NOTHING TO DO
HOW DO YOU FEEL MR BLAKE ASKED VOLTAIRE BLANDLY
WHEN I HAD FINISHED TELLING TOM MY STORY HE SEEMED PERFECTLY ASTOUNDED
THEN OUR EYES MET
I SOON FOUND THE MAN WHO HAD ISSUED TICKETS ON THE NIGHT I HAVE MENTIONED
HE WAS A STRONGER MAN THAN I NATURALLY WHILE BY HIS TERRIBLE POWER I WAS RENDERED ENTIRELY HELPLESS
KAFFAR WAS GETTING TROUBLESOME TO ME AND I WANTED TO GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY
I AM NOT SURE AND THE LITTLE MAN LOOKED VERY WISE
THIS MORNING AS I TOLD YOU HE ARRANGED FOR KAFFAR'S LUGGAGE TO BE SENT TO EGYPT WHILE HE HIMSELF IS PREPARING TO DEPART WHERE IS HE GOING TO LONDON AND MISS FORREST SHE I HOPE WILL STAY WITH US FOR SOME TIME
HAVE YOU FOUND OUT ANYTHING MORE ABOUT HIM NO I HAVE NOT
THE PHENOMENA THAT WILL BE BROUGHT BEFORE YOU ARE PURELY PSYCHOLOGICAL
EVERYTHING IS CONFUSION
I MASTERED MYSELF HOWEVER AND SO DID NOT TOUCH HIM
WE TRIED TO RECALL ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID AND DONE
I HAVE MANLINESS ENOUGH FOR THAT EVEN YET NO SHE SAID PROUDLY BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONLY MAN I EVER DID OR CAN LOVE FOR A MINUTE I FORGOT MY WOES MY PAINS
PERHAPS I SHALL WANT TO SEE YOU OCCASIONALLY
I HAVE ALTERED MY MIND GERTRUDE AND AM GOING WITH YOU THIS WAS SAID IN A HARSH THICK VOICE
BUT TWO OTHER FORMS STOOD BY ME ONE BEARING A LANTERN
HIS FACE WAS AS THE FACE OF THE DEAD EXCEPT FOR HIS EYES
VERY I REPLIED
AS HE DID SO I SAW KAFFAR COME AWAY FROM ONE OF THE LADS WHO WAS EMPLOYED ABOUT THE HOUSE
THE MAN WAS A VILLAIN POSSESSED OF A STRANGE AND DANGEROUS POWER AND THAT POWER HE WOULD NOT HESITATE TO EXERT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY
IF HE COULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT I WAS UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING TO FREE MYSELF I SHOULD HAVE PERHAPS CAUGHT HIM UNAWARES
I HAD BEEN TRAVELLING INCESSANTLY FOR FORTY HOURS SO I AM AFRAID I DID NOT PRESENT A VERY PLEASANT APPEARANCE
A TRAIN STOOD AT ANOTHER PLATFORM WHICH STOPPED AT A STATION SOME TWO MILES FROM TOM TEMPLE'S HOME
SO I ASKED TO SEE THE PROPRIETOR OF THE PLACE
YOU ARE COOL AND CONSIDERATE
AM I JUSTIN
YES HE WAS SAYING I AM WHAT IS CALLED A SUPERSTITIOUS MAN
ONLY ONE LITTLE WEEK AND A DAY THAT WAS ALL AND THEN IF I DID NOT PRODUCE KAFFAR ALL WAS LOST
VOLTAIRE HAS FOUND OUT THIS AND HE TOO WANTS YOU FOR HIS WIFE
PARDON ME REPLIED VOLTAIRE BUT TONIGHT IS CHRISTMAS EVE AND AS MY STORY MIGHT BE REGARDED AS HEATHENISH I WILL WAIT FOR SOME MORE FAVOURABLE TIME WHEN YOUR MINDS WILL NOT BE INFLUENCED BY THE MEMORIES OF THE BIRTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
I HAD NO SOONER ENTERED THE STABLE-YARD THAN SIMON SLOWDEN APPEARED AND BECKONED TO ME
I TOOK THE NEXT TRAIN FOR LEEDS AND THERE MY SUCCESS ENDED
HE SAW THAT EVERY EYE WAS FIXED UPON HIM WHILE THE FACES OF SOME OF THE YOUNG LADIES WERE BLANCHED WITH TERROR
THEN SOMETHING HEAVY SEEMED TO MOVE AWAY I THOUGHT I HEARD STRANGE CREEPING NOISES LIKE THAT OF AN ADDER CRAWLING AMIDST THICK DRY GRASS AND THEN ALL WAS BLANK
THE BLESSED VIRGIN HAD TAKEN HIM HOME
YOU THINK YOU ARE FREE FROM ME
BEGONE
THEN MAN THIS CASE WILL BE SIFTED TO THE BOTTOM
WHY IT'S MY BELIEF AS OW SHE'S BIN A WACCINATED TEN TIMES YER HONOUR WHY SIMON WHY SHE'S WITHOUT BLOOD OR MARROW SHE IS
BUT IT'S ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW SAID TOM UNEASILY
BESIDES WHICH HE HAD TAKEN THREE LARGE BREAKFAST CUPS OF CHOCOLATE
I WENT WITH MY FRIEND KAFFAR AWAY FURTHER INTO THE HEART OF NUBIA
THE CLOCK ON THE MANTELPIECE BEGAN TO STRIKE THREE
YOU ARE A LIAR AND A VILLAIN HE SCREAMED
MEANWHILE MISS FORREST HAD CLUNG TREMBLINGLY TO MY ARM
I LEAVE THIS COUNTRY--FOR EVER
HIS EFFORTS WERE IN VAIN HOWEVER AND FOR THE TIME AT ALL EVENTS THE BATTLE WAS NOT WITH HIM
I HAD FOLLOWED IN ENGLAND EVERY POSSIBLE CLUE ALL OF WHICH HAD ENDED IN FAILURE
I IMPLORE THE LADY'S PARDON I SEE NO MEANING IN YOUR WORDS SAID MISS FORREST QUIETLY THEREFORE I SEE NOTHING TO FORGIVE AH I LIVE AGAIN
THAT WAS PLAIN
HE NEVER LOST HIS SEEMING SELF-POSSESSION
THESE THOUGHTS HAD SCARCELY PASSED THROUGH MY MIND WHEN HEARING A SOUND BEHIND ME I TURNED AND SAW MISS FORREST WHO MET ME WITH A BRIGHT GOOD-MORNING AND THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON
AND THIS EVIDENTLY MADDENED HIM
THEN BRING HIM HERE AGAIN
DO YOU DOUBT THE EXISTENCE OF THE FORCES I HAVE MENTIONED HE ASKED
BUT UPON THIS I DO INSIST
HE DECLARED THAT HE COULDN'T BEAR THE IDEA OF LEAVING US AFTER HE'D GONE THROUGH SO MUCH TO BRING US TOGETHER
I COULD NOT TELL
I COULD NOT TELL
I COULD NOT TELL
WE HAVE A FEW GOOD HORSES SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME RIDES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
AND SHOULD I BE HAPPY
BUT IT'S MADE HER NO SOFTER TOWARDS YOU
THE PROFESSOR SMILED
I TRACED HIS FOOTSTEPS ALONG THE HIGH-ROAD FOR A LONG WHILE AND THEN WE LOST SIGHT OF THEM
SIX O'CLOCK
HE'S MY ONLY SON
INSTANTLY A BURDEN ROLLED AWAY FROM MY HEART AND FOR A FEW MINUTES I WAS THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
IT WOULD BE NO USE TO GO TO MISS FORREST'S HOUSE IN KENSINGTON AND TELL HER THAT SIMON SLOWDEN HAD WHILE IN A MESMERIC SLEEP SEEN KAFFAR IN ITALY
HE STAYED IN LONDON A FEW DAYS AFTER THE SCENE ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND I GAVE HIM HOUSE-ROOM IN MY OLD LODGINGS
I DID NOT THINK SO
ARRIVING AT THE LANDING WE SAW MISS FORREST AND MISS GRAY LEAVING MRS TEMPLE AT THE DOOR OF HER ROOM
I MUST BE ON THE WATCH
THANK YOU I REPLIED COLDLY
CAUSE CONTINUED SIMON I THOUGHT AS HOW YOU WACCINATORS OR MESMERISTS MADE PASSES AS THEY CALL EM AND WAVED YOUR HANDS ABOUT AND LIKE THAT DID THAT MR VOLTAIRE I THINK YOU CALL HIM MAKE PASSES ASKED THE PROFESSOR
SHE'S AN ANGEL OF A GIRL AND I'M IN HOPES THAT--WELL I DON'T BELIEVE SHE HATES ME GOOD TOM
A WEEK MORE SLIPPED BY
THE SECRET IS MINE SON HEROD SAID ABOU BUT IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO LEARN YET
COULD I SEE HER
YOU HAVE ASKED A GREAT MANY
YOU ARE A MOONING COWARD HE RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM AS HE SPOKE AND A MINUTE LATER I HEARD THE HALL DOOR SLAMMED WITH VEHEMENCE
THEN MY NAME IS UNFORTUNATE
SO I GOT BEHIND A LARGE TREE WHICH WHILE IT HID ME FROM ANY ONE ENTERING THE HOUSE ENABLED ME TO BE WITHIN EARSHOT OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE SAID ESPECIALLY SO AS THE SUMMER-HOUSE WAS A RUSTIC AFFAIR AND THE SIDES BY NO MEANS THICK
DID SHE KEEP A BOARDING-HOUSE
BOTH WALKED UP TO US AND BOTH SMILED ON MRS TEMPLE WHEREUPON SHE INTRODUCED THEM
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING SHE CRIED
BESIDES WHICH YOU WILL HAVE TO PRODUCE MY FRIEND A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
IT SWEPT INTO THE STATION IN GOOD TIME AND TO MY GREAT RELIEF AND DELIGHT I SAW SIMON APPEAR ON THE PLATFORM LOOKING AS STOLID AND IMPERTURBABLE AS EVER
I ASKED YOU TO MARRY ME--ME WHO WOULD GIVE UP EVERYTHING FOR YOU
THAT WAS AT THE END OF THREE MONTHS
HOWEVER YOU WILL HAVE A CHAPERON SO THE DEFICIENCY WILL BE MORE THAN REMEDIED AND THERE WAS GRIM SATISFACTION IN THE WOMAN'S VOICE
TO ME HE WAS ESPECIALLY INSULTING AND WENT SO FAR AS TO HINT THAT I UNLIKE OTHER ENGLISHMEN WAS A COWARD
EXPECT US EARLY TO-MORROW MORNING I SAID AND THEN WENT AWAY TO THE NEAREST TELEGRAPH OFFICE WITH A LIGHTER HEART THAN I HAD KNOWN FOR MANY LONG MONTHS
STILL I DID ALL I COULD AND THEN HURRIED ON TO CAIRO
WE ARE ALL ANXIOUS TO HEAR IT I MENTIONED LAST NIGHT SAID VOLTAIRE THAT I HAD SPENT SOME TIME IN EGYPT UP BY THE NILE
INDEED THERE IS SCARCELY A YOUTH OR MAIDEN WHO WILL BE SEEN HERE AFTER DARK WHY ASKED VOLTAIRE SUDDENLY
I MUST DO SOMETHING
THE THOUGHT OF MARRYING THAT MAN IS MADNESS MISS FORREST I CRIED YOU MUST THINK I HAVE LOST ALL MANHOOD ALL SELF-RESPECT WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT I SAY
DARKNESS AND LIGHT IX
DO AS I WISH YOU AND I SHALL NOT TROUBLE YOU I DEFY YOU I CRIED
THE SECOND DINNER BELL RANG AND SO MECHANICALLY OFFERING MY ARM TO A LADY WHO HAD I THOUGHT BEEN NEGLECTED ON ACCOUNT OF HER PLAIN LOOKS I FOLLOWED THE GUESTS TO THE DINING-ROOM
THOSE FINE PEOPLE YOU ARE ABOUT TO VISIT DID NOT THINK IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO INVITE YOUR AUNT'S LATE HUSBAND'S STEP-SISTER--PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE IS POOR
AND I SAYS TO MYSELF SIMON SLOWDEN I SAYS THIS YER IS THE LAST TIME YOU MUST BE EVER TAKEN IN AND NOW I'M RIGHT MAD THAT I SHOULD A BIN LICKED IN THIS YER WAY I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT SIMON'S STORY IN SPITE OF MY HEAVY HEART AND SO I ASKED HIM WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID WHEN HE FOUND VACCINATION A FAILURE
TEARS COME INTO MY EYES NOW AS I REMEMBER HOW HER NEW-FOUND HAPPINESS LIT UP HER EYES WITH JOY AND HOW THE COLOUR CAME INTO HER BEAUTIFUL CHEEKS
I LEFT YORKSHIRE WITH SOME LITTLE HOPE IN MY HEART--THE MEMORY OF GERTRUDE'S WORDS WAS WITH ME CHEERING ME DURING THE LONG RIDE
SHE WAS TIED DOWN TO NO CONVENTIONALITIES
INDEED MY BRAIN WAS VERY ACTIVE AND I BEGAN TO REASON OUT WHY I SHOULD BE SO INFLUENCED AND WHY I SHOULD ACT SO STRANGELY
I HAD NOT BEEN THERE TEN MINUTES WHEN MISS FORREST ENTERED
THERE LOOK AT ME
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU SO PROMPT
IT WAS MY DUTY TO MAKE THIS SACRIFICE
THERE'S SOME DEEP-LAID SCHEME ON FOOT SOMEWHERE
THEN KAFFAR WENT OUT AND MR BLAKE WENT AFTER HIM AFTER HIM
THAT MOMENT MY JEALOUSY WHICH HAD BEEN ALLAYED NOW SURGED FURIOUSLY IN ME AND I DETERMINED THAT THAT VERY NIGHT I WOULD MATCH THE STRENGTH OF MY MIND WITH THE STRENGTH OF HIS
THEY HAVE JUST BEEN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS
IF GOD CARED I THOUGHT HE WOULD HELP THE INNOCENT
I HAD JUST REACHED THE DOOR WHEN I HEARD VOICES
HE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY YOU REGARDED HIS MAGICAL STORY AND HIS THOUGHT-READING
I SHALL BE MORE THAN DELIGHTED IF MISS FORREST WILL I DID NOT FINISH THE SENTENCE
HERE IS HIS SCARF WHICH HAS EVIDENTLY BEEN STRAINED AND ON IT ARE SPOTS OF BLOOD WHILE ALL AROUND ARE MARKS INDICATING A STRUGGLE
INDEED I WAS VERY GLAD I COULD NOT
THEN I QUIETLY LED MY HORSE AWAY AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE WHERE DARK FIR TREES MADE THE SCENE IF POSSIBLE MORE GLOOMY THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN
HE WAS FAIRLY TALL WELL BUILT AND HAD EVIDENTLY ENJOYED THE EDUCATION AND ADVANTAGES OF A MAN OF WEALTH
EVIDENTLY THIS MAN WAS A VILLAIN AND WANTED TO MAKE HER HIS WIFE
COME HE SAID DO YOU CONSENT TO MY TERMS
I WOULD HEAR THIS CONFERENCE IN THE WOOD THAT EVENING
BUT I SHOULD THINK IT WAS FAVOURABLE FOR THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF WHISPERING AND AFTER A WHILE I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT THAT DREADFUL MAN BEING MR BLAKE'S ENEMY AH
FIVE WAS THE REPLY
DID I REALLY KILL THAT MAN HE LOOKED AT ME CURIOUSLY AS IF HE SUSPECTED SOMETHING
THIS WAS EASILY ARRANGED AND SOON AFTER SIMON AND I WERE TOGETHER
IS MR BLAKE CONVINCED SAID MISS STAGGLES LEERING TOWARDS ME
YOU WOULD NOT SUFFER IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE ROOM HE SAID EYEING A SOVEREIGN I WAS TURNING OVER IN MY HAND
HE DOES NOT LIKE YOU SHE WENT ON
THE HOUSE WAS VERY QUIET HOWEVER FOR WHICH I WAS VERY GLAD
AND WHAT IS THIS VOLTAIRE PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
HE WAS NOT REMEMBERED AT SOME TWENTY HOTELS AT WHICH I CALLED
STRANGE IT MAY APPEAR BUT IT IS STILL TRUE AND SO WHILE ONE PART OF MY BEING OR SELF WAS REALIZING TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH I WAS SURROUNDED THE OTHER ENSLAVED PART TREMBLED AND FEARED AT SOME DREADFUL FUTURE AND FELT BOUND TO DO WHAT IT WOULD FAIN RESIST
WOULD KAFFAR HAVE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE FOLLOWED IN SUCH A WAY
I SHALL NOT GO I REPLIED
ON THE VERY FACE OF IT IT WAS ABSURD
NINE DAYS SUR--ONLY NINE DAYS
WAS THERE ANY VESTIGE OF INTEREST IN HER HEART BEYOND THAT WHICH SHE FELT FOR ANY PASSING ACQUAINTANCE
I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE SAID WE I CANNOT SAY THAT I ENJOYED MYSELF VERY MUCH
I HAD PLENTY OF MONEY
THEN I REMEMBERED THAT SIMON HAD DESCRIBED KAFFAR AS BEING IN A ROOM WITH A MAN
A HATER OF HUMBUG A DESPISER OF CANT TRUE ENOUGH
WHY I ENGAGED SOME FELLOWS TO COME HERE AND GIVE US AN ENTERTAINMENT TO-NIGHT AND THEY WRITE TO SAY THEY CAN'T COME
DO ALL YOU CAN WITH ME VOLTAIRE AND KAFFAR CAME UP TO ME WHILE THE REST CROWDED AROUND
HIS EYES WERE OF A COLOUR THAT DID NOT ACCORD WITH HIS BLACK HAIR AND SWARTHY COMPLEXION
IT MEANS THAT YOUR VILLAINOUS SCHEMES ARE OF NO EFFECT
THIS BLOOD CRIES OUT FOR VENGEANCE HE SAID
I WAS INTRODUCED TO THEM IN BERLIN
SHORTLY AFTER WE ARRIVED AT THE MIDLAND STATION FOR WHICH I WAS TRULY THANKFUL
BEGONE HE CRIED
I BEGAN TO PICTURE MYSELF IN CONVERSATION WITH HER AND BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH HER WHEN I ACCIDENTALLY LOOKED AT HEROD VOLTAIRE
AT LAST VOLTAIRE WITH A SIDELONG GLANCE AT ME ASKED WHETHER WE WERE CONVINCED AND ONE BY ONE THE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY EXPRESSED THEIR WONDER AND ASTONISHMENT

WARD
I DID NOT LOOK AT HIM UNTIL THE GIRL HAD SHOWN HIM IN AND LEFT THE ROOM
AND IF NO GOD GOOD AND EVIL WERE LITTLE MORE THAN NAMES
WE WERE NOT LONG IN REACHING GOWER STREET WHERE SIMON ENJOYED A GOOD BREAKFAST AFTER WHICH WE DREW UP OUR CHAIRS BEFORE THE CHEERFUL FIRE AND BEGAN TO TALK
THEY WERE MOSTLY YOUNG ALTHOUGH I SAW ONE OR TWO ANCIENT-LOOKING DAMES WHO I SUPPOSED HAD COME TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR DAUGHTERS
THEY'RE ALLAYS A-BRINGIN IN SOME NEW-FANGLED THING OR OTHER BUT GENERALLY THERE'S NOWT IN EM
ACCORDINGLY ON MY ARRIVAL IN THE CITY I OBTAINED A COPY
WE ARE NOT SORRY FOR THIS FOR HE HAS BEEN AN INCALCULABLE HELP TO ME IN MANY WAYS
BUT THEN I DON'T SEEM TO PLEASE
WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND REPLIED THE PROFESSOR
AT ANY TIME HE COULD EXERT HIS POWER AND MAKE ME HIS SLAVE
BUT IT WAS NOT THE KIND OF AFTERNOON WHEN ONE COULD ENJOY TO THE FULL SUCH A PLACE SO WE WERE NOT LONG BEFORE WE TURNED OUR HORSES HEADS HOMEWARD
DREARWATER POND VIII
SHE HAD ONLY JUST SAT DOWN WHEN SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER LADY WHO APPEARED FROM THE SIGN OF RECOGNITION THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM AN ACQUAINTANCE
ON CONDITION THAT HE LEFT ENGLAND NEVER TO RETURN AGAIN BESIDES STIPULATING FOR KAFFAR'S SAFETY
I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU A SCRAPPY ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED I REMEMBERED TOM'S POWERS OF MEMORY HOWEVER FOR WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN REMARKABLE AT SCHOOL AND I KNEW THAT THE ACCOUNT HE GAVE ME WAS NOT FAR FROM CORRECT AND I BEGGED HIM TO GO ON
YES HE SAID YOU MAY WELL BE SILENT FOR WHAT I SAY IS TRUE
KAFFAR I NOTICED FIXED HIS EYES UPON HIS FRIEND AND IN HIS STONY STARE HE SEEMED POSSESSED OF AN EVIL SPIRIT
HE STARED AT ME BLANKLY BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT FOR SOON HIS LIGHT EYES GLITTERED
I KNEW HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS ME FELT SURE THAT HE HATED ME AND THUS I KEPT ON MY GUARD
YES SIR THAT'S THE NAME
DID HER QUICK MIND GUESS MY CONDITION
AH THAT EXPLAINS SOMEWHAT
WHO'D A THOUGHT AS OW I SHOULD HASSIST IN A WACCINATIN BUSINESS LIKE THIS ERE
BUT THAT CONDITION MAKES ME HOPELESS WHAT SHE CRIED
SO I BEGINS MY LETTER THIS YER WAY
CHAPTER VII DREARWATER POND I WILL NOT TRY TO DESCRIBE MY WALK BACK TO TEMPLE HALL OR TELL OF THE TERRIBLE SENSATIONS THAT I FELT
I DID NOT LEAVE ALONE
THEY HAD MADE EVERY INQUIRY POSSIBLE THEY HAD SET ON FOOT DOZENS OF SCHEMES
I HAVE LAIN UNDER HER STATELY PALMS AND WATCHED THE TWINKLING STARS
YES MORE PARTICULARLY ALTHOUGH THERE IS BUT LITTLE MORE VARIATION AMONG THE MEN
SHE CAME UP BY MY SIDE AGAIN PRESENTLY HOWEVER BUT THERE WAS A STRANGE LOOK ON HER FACE
MISS FORREST SEEMED VERY GLAD TO SEE ME AND SAID EAGERLY I CAME DOWN TO ASK WHETHER YOU HAD FOUND MR BLAKE
SURELY I HAD HIT UPON A PLAN AT LAST A PLAN ON WHICH I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT AT THE OUTSET
YOU CAN SEE MORE CLEARLY NOW SIMON PEERED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THEN SAID YES I CAN SEE HIM
LET'S WAIT TILL WE GET TO TEMPLE HALL THEN IN THAT CASE YOU WILL HAVE TO GO HOME IN A CAB
KAFFAR'S HE SAID
BUT LET HIM HAVE NO SUPPER UNTIL AFTER I HAVE DONE WITH HIM NINE O'CLOCK TO-NIGHT
WILL YOU INSIST ON HER ABIDING BY A PROMISE WHICH WAS MADE IN EXCITEMENT TO SAVE AN INNOCENT MAN INNOCENT HE SNEERED AND I NOTICED A LOOK OF VICTORY STILL IN HIS GLITTERING EYE
EVIDENTLY HE IS ON A JOURNEY AND WE MUST WAIT UNTIL HE ARRIVES AT HIS DESTINATION BUT CAN'T SLOWDEN REMAIN AS HE IS AND WATCH HIM THE THING WOULD BE AT ONCE CRUEL AND PREPOSTEROUS SIR
SIMON SLOWDEN SAID HE HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU CAME TO YORKSHIRE AGAIN
I WILL NAME IT
ONE OF THE YOUNG LADIES GAVE A SLIGHT SCREAM AND THEN HE APOLOGIZED FOR HAVING NO MORE TO TELL
I'LL START AT ONCE
I ONLY KNOW I CANNOT STAY LONG WHY AGAIN I HAVE MUCH TO THINK ABOUT MUCH TO DO AND I HAVE MUCH TO TELL YOU I CAN GUESS IT I THINK
I DID NOT FORCE IT
I HURRIED TO THE SUMMER-HOUSE FOR I WISHED TO BE THERE BEFORE THEY ARRIVED
I HAD BEEN WITH THE WOMAN I WANTED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO ACCOMPANY WE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION WHICH WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE INTERESTING FOR ME AND THEN FOR NO REASON SAVE THIS MAN'S ACCURSED POWER I HAD COME BACK WHERE I HAD NO DESIRE TO BE
DURING DINNER KAFFAR MADE HIMSELF VERY DISAGREEABLE
PRESENTLY THEY GOT UP AND WENT AWAY WHILE I WITH ACHING HEAD AND FAST-BEATING HEART TRIED TO THINK WHAT TO DO
ABOU AL PHADRE WAS AN OLD MAN AND NOT ONE WHOM THE LADIES WOULD LOVE--THAT IS FOR HIS FACE FOR IT WAS YELLOW AND WRINKLED
AND I BEGAN TO THINK THAT AS FAR AS THE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED THE CHRISTMAS GATHERING WOULD BE A SOMEWHAT TAME AFFAIR
IT WAS IMMEDIATELY OPENED AND SHE ENTERED AND WHAT THEN I LISTENED JUST SO
BUT ALL IN VAIN
STAY I FORGOT
IT CANNOT BE HE WENT TO THE WRITING-DESK THAT STOOD NEAR BY AND COMMENCED WRITING
HOW WHY I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A BIT WHY THAT ERE GHOST WUR A GOT UP YOU THINK IT WAS GOT UP THEN CERTAIN OF IT YER HONOUR WELL TELL US ABOUT IT WELL SUR AFTER YOU LEFT ALL OF A HURRY LIKE WE HAD A BIG PARTY IN THE HOUSE AND ALL THE SERVANTS AD TO ELP
SHOW THIS GENTLEMAN OUT MARY I SAID
ON THE ONE HAND HE WAS VERY CUNNING AND ON THE OTHER HE KNEW BUT LITTLE OF THE MEANS OF DETECTING PEOPLE IN ENGLAND
FANCY IF YOU CAN THE SCENE
WHY DO YOU KNOW THAT TAKES AWAY ANOTHER DAY
INSTANTLY THE ROOM WAS PEOPLED WITH A STRANGE CROWD
SEE WITH WHAT BREATHLESS INTEREST IT WAS LISTENED TO AND HOW IT HAUNTS THE MEMORIES OF YOUR HEARERS EVEN YET THIS RAISED A SLIGHT TITTER
THERE'S A RAILWAY STATION IN THE TOWN
THE LITTLE KOPTIC COMMUNITY DWELLING IN THE LOW HUTS WHICH REEKED WITH DIRT AND VERMIN WOULD ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HAVE BEEN GLAD TO HAVE DIED
NOTHING HAPPENED THERE WORTH RECORDING
ON OUR WAY BACK FROM CHURCH WE MET VOLTAIRE AND KAFFAR WHO WERE EAGERLY CONVERSING
CAIRO WAS COMPARATIVELY EMPTY
WE WALKED UP AND DOWN AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH NO SUCCESS
AND THUS WHILE ALL THE REST LAUGHED AND WERE JOYFUL I WAS SOLITARY AND SAD
THE STABLE-BOY HAD SCARCELY TAKEN THE HORSES WHEN A THOUGHT STRUCK ME
I CANNOT SACRIFICE DISINTERESTEDLY
IF I MISSED IN THIS ALL WAS LOST
BUT THAT IS THE WAY
THE WHOLE PARTY ARE GOING FOR A RIDE THIS AFTERNOON
SHE NEVER SPEAKS TO ME
THIS INSULT WAS TOO GREAT
I WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE
YES THERE WERE TWO CLOSE TOGETHER
I THOWT SUR AS IT WOULD TAKE A HANGEL WITH BLACK WINGS TO NICK ME LIKE THIS ERE AND NOW I'VE BIN DONE BY SOMEBODY
NO ONE BUT THOSE WHO KNOW CAN TELL THE TERROR OF A MAN WHO HAS GIVEN UP BELIEF IN AN ETERNAL GOODNESS IN A LIVING GOD THAT CARES FOR MAN
AS SOON AS I WUR FIT TO BE SEEN I WENT TO SUSAN TO GIT A MITE O COMFORT AND THEN I SEE ER A-COURTIN WI THE COACHMAN
GENTLEMEN ALL GENTLEMEN MIGHT I ASK THEIR NATIONALITY I SAID
NO DOUBT I WAS TRAVEL-STAINED AND DUSTY ENOUGH
INSTEAD OF THIS HOWEVER SHE FRANKLY ACCEPTED MY ESCORT AND ACCORDINGLY THE RIDE WAS ARRANGED
THEN I'LL WAKE UP THIS MAN SIMON WOKE UP AS USUAL RUBBING HIS EYES AND ASKED WHETHER ANY GOOD HAD BEEN DONE
OF COURSE HE MIGHT HAVE MEANS OF KEEPING HIM THERE IN STRICT SECRECY OR HE MIGHT HAVE A SCORE OF DISGUISES TO KEEP HIM FROM DETECTION
THERE WERE ONLY SEVENTEEN DAYS LEFT NOW
I HAVE NOT TRIED TO GIVE ANY DETAILED ACCOUNT OF MY JOURNEYS NOR OF THE ALTERNATE FEELINGS OF HOPE AND DESPAIR THAT POSSESSED ME
I COULD NOT EXPLAIN IT AND I COULD NOT THROW IT OFF BUT EVER SINCE I HAD AWOKE OUT OF MY MESMERIC SLEEP OR WHATEVER THE READER MAY BE PLEASED TO CALL IT I FELT NUMBED
AS IT WAS HOWEVER THE SAME KIND OF SERPENT THAT HAD LAID THE BEAUTIFUL CLEOPATRA LOW LIKEWISE SET AT LIBERTY THE SOUL OF ILFRA
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HE SAID EVIDENTLY MR BLAKE WITH HIS HARD ENGLISH COMMON-SENSE HAS RAISED SOME AMOUNT OF DOUBT IN YOUR MINDS AS TO THE VALIDITY OF MY STORY AND OF OUR PERFORMANCE
THE BLUNT YORKSHIREMAN'S DESCRIPTION OF HIM TALLIED EXACTLY WITH THE REAL APPEARANCE OF THE EGYPTIAN
AND YET I WAS ABLE TO THINK
WIDELY READ SHE WAS ABLE TO CONVERSE ABOUT BOOKS SHE LOVED AND POSSESSING A MIND THAT WAS UNTRAMMELLED BY SOCIETY NOTIONS IT WAS REFRESHING TO HEAR HER TALK
IT WAS A QUARTER-PAST ELEVEN AND AS I GOT OUT I NOTICED THAT WE STOOD IN FRONT OF ONE OF THOSE TALL NOBLE-LOOKING MANSIONS WHICH ARE SO COMMON IN KENSINGTON
HOW CAN EE COME THIS YER WAY A MINIT YER HONOUR CERTAINLY I SAID AND FOLLOWED HIM INTO A ROOM OVER THE STABLES
HOPE LIVED WITHIN ME AND CONFIDENCE AS TO THE FUTURE BEGAN TO INSPIRE ME
SURELY NO ONE PERCEIVES THAT WE ARE SUSPICIOUS PARTIES I CANNOT SAY
IT MIGHT BE FAR FROM PERFECT BUT IT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR ME
I HAD A GREAT WORK TO DO
WELL I HOPE SO
YOU CANNOT FORCE LOVE AND THE VERY NATURE OF THE CASE WOULD MAKE SUCH A THING IMPOSSIBLE
THE SNOW HAD GONE AND THE ICE HAD MELTED
I TRIED TO CONQUER MYSELF HOWEVER AND TO TELL TOM TO GO ON WITH HIS RECITAL
YOU ACTED IN PRETTY NEARLY THE SAME WAY AS SIMON HERE BUT NOTHING ELSE
DO NOT FEAR
THE CLOUDS BEGAN TO DISPEL THE DIFFICULTIES BEGAN TO MOVE AWAY
THEN PERCHANCE HE WILL HAVE FINISHED HIS JOURNEY AND ACCORDINGLY HE PROCEEDED TO AWAKE SIMON
I NEED NOT SAY I WAS EARLY AT ST PANCRAS THE FOLLOWING MORNING
I FELT I COULD NOT GO IN FOR A FEW MINUTES
THEN HE SAID SLOWLY MR JUSTIN BLAKE YOU THINK YOU HAVE OUTWITTED HEROD VOLTAIRE
YOU KNOW MISS FORREST WELL DON'T YOU HER EDUCATION AND HER DISPOSITION I'VE KNOWN HER LONG ENOUGH WELL TELL ME WHETHER I AM CORRECT IN MY ESTIMATE OF HER CHARACTER
THERE YOU SEE HE'S COMING TO I FELT SOMETHING COLD AT MY TEMPLES THEN A STRANGE SHIVERING SENSATION PASSED OVER ME AND I WAS AWAKE
BECAUSE I BROUGHT HIM I SAID TO SAVE THIS LADY AND EXPOSE YOU
BUT WHAT'S THIS GOT TO DO WITH THE MATTER IN SPITE OF THIS HOWEVER WENT ON VOLTAIRE WITHOUT HEEDING MISS STAGGLES QUERY SHE HAS A GREAT DEAL OF ROMANCE IN HER NATURE
MR TEMPLE HAS ARRANGED FOR A CONJUROR AND A VENTRILOQUIST TO COME AND THUS WE SHALL HAVE SOMETHING TO OCCUPY OUR ATTENTION BESIDES ORDINARY CHITCHAT I'M VERY GLAD I REPLIED ALTHOUGH I SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SPEND THE EVENING AS I HAVE SPENT THIS MORNING I SAID THIS WITH AN EARNESTNESS ABOUT WHICH THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT AND I FANCIED I SAW A BLUSH MOUNT TO HER CHEEK
WOULD YOU MIND TAKING THIS CHAIR MY FRIEND?"--TO SIMON
HE LEFT THE HOUSE SOON AFTER AND WE ALL FELT A SENSE OF RELIEF WHEN HE HAD GONE SAVE MISS STAGGLES OR RATHER MRS VOLTAIRE WHO WENT UP TO HER ROOM WEEPING BITTERLY
SHOW MY FRIENDS IN I SAID
WOULD YOU MIND LEADING HIM TO THE LIBRARY VOLTAIRE CONTINUED
BUT NO J'INTS PROPER SO YOU BELIEVE IN THIS GHOST CAN'T HELP IT YER HONOUR SIMON I DON'T
SIMON I SAID GO TO THAT LODGING-HOUSE AND ASK WHETHER ANY MESSAGE HAS BEEN RECEIVED THE WILLING FELLOW STILL WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE AND A CHEERY LOOK STARTED TO DO MY BIDDING
I TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN
THIS LATTER FEATURE WOULD IN THE EYES OF MANY DESTROY HER PRETENSIONS TO BEAUTY BUT I WHO LIKED PERSONS WITH A WILL OF THEIR OWN ADMIRED THE FIRM RESOLUTENESS THE FEATURE INDICATED
I KNEW THE WOMAN I LOVED WAS NEAR ME
MISS FORREST WAS THEN ENGAGED
IT WAS FOOLISHNESS TO THINK OF GOD I SAID
SO WONDERFUL THAT AFTERWARDS YOU COULD BELIEVE THE STORIES TOLD BY YOUR MOST RENOWNED SATIRIST DEAN SWIFT FAVOUR US WITH ONE I SUGGESTED
THE OLD NUMBING FEELING STILL POSSESSED ME
I DO NOT OFFER ANY EXCUSE HOWEVER
THERE WAS A TRAIN DUE FROM THIS FASHIONABLE SEAPORT AT 12.30
EVERYTHING WAS MYSTERY
ANOTHER WAS EQUALLY CERTAIN HE HAD AT THE SAME TIME SEEN HIM IN BERLIN
WELL I'LL STAY UP WITH YOU THIS GHOST AFFAIR IS NONSENSE TOM
AND WHEN AFTER HAVING BREAKFASTED I WAS WONDERING WHERE HE WAS I FELT THE OLD TERRIBLE SENSATION COME OVER ME
HOPING DESPAIRING EVER TOILING EVER SEARCHING YET NEVER ACHIEVING
IF I WERE HANGED I CARED NOT
JUDGE HIS ANGUISH THEN AND MY DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN SEVEN DAYS BEFORE HER TWENTY-FIRST BIRTHDAY SHE WAS BITTEN BY A CERASTES AND HER BODY DIED
BEFORE I FORGET MYSELF AND SEND FOR THE POLICE TO LOCK YOU UP
TEMPLE HALL IS A CURIOUS PLACE HE SAID
HE'S GOT A PILLER AND HE'S STRETCHIN HISSELF ON THE SEAT AND LAYIN HIS HEAD ON THE PILLER
WHY MA'AM I SAID I'M YOUNG AND SIMPLE AND I WUR FRIGHTENED WI A GHOST T'OTHER NIGHT AND I THOUGHT AS HOW YOU BEIN PURTY HANCIENT MIGHT ASSIST ME IN FINDIN THINGS OUT ABOUT IT WITH THAT SUR SHE LOOKED OAL STRANGE AND I THINKS I'M ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND I SAYS AGAIN THAT ERE GHOST WUR WELL GOT UP MUM
YES THERE IS VILLAINY I THINK
DID SHE GO TO HIM EVIDENTLY REPLIED TOM
EAGERLY I OPENED THOSE WHICH CAME FROM THE DETECTIVES AND FEVERISHLY READ THEM
ON ORDINARY OCCASIONS I SHOULD NOT HAVE MINDED MUCH BUT NOW EVERYTHING DEPENDED ON MY GETTING TO LONDON AT A CERTAIN HOUR
BESIDES I WAS NOT SURE THAT KAFFAR WAS ALIVE
SENT ME OFF WITHOUT A CHARACTER SUR HE REPLIED GRIMLY
I AM VERY SORRY BUT MIGHT I ASK WHY YOU SAW FIT TO CHANGE YOUR CONDUCT FROM FRIENDLINESS TO EXTREME AVERSION I'M ALMOST ASHAMED TO TELL YOU MR BLAKE BUT I WILL
KAFFAR CANNOT BE FOUND OR PROVED ALIVE AND THUS MY POWER OVER YOU IS ABSOLUTE I WONDER YOU DO NOT USE IT I SAID QUIETLY
WE HAD SPENT SOME LITTLE TIME IN PARIS OR WE COULD HAVE DONE IT MORE QUICKLY
AWAY ON THE OPEN MOORS THERE WAS NO FEAR OF EAVESDROPPERS
I SAW VOLTAIRE AND KAFFAR EXCHANGING GLANCES AND I FELT SURE THAT I HEARD THE FORMER SAY IN ARABIC NOT YET AFTER THIS THE TWO ARRANGED TO GIVE US SOME MANIFESTATIONS OF THEIR POWER
THIS WAS SCARCELY TO BE WONDERED AT
I RECOGNIZED MORE CLEARLY THE OBJECTS WHICH HAD STRUCK ME DURING MY FIRST VISIT WHILE THE STORIES WHICH HAD BEEN TOLD CAME BACK TO ME WITH TERRIBLE DISTINCTNESS
STAY A MINUTE THOUGH
HERE THE WARM SUN WHICH HAD BEEN HIDDEN ON THE OTHER SIDE BY THE HIGH MOUNTAIN RANGE HAD MELTED THE SNOW AND SO BRIGHT STREAMS OF WATER CAME RUSHING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDES LAUGHING AS IF IN GLEE
POSSESSING THAT HE BECOMES FREE BECAUSE HE POSSESSES A LIFE SUPERIOR TO MERE PHYSICAL OR HUMAN POWER
THERE ARE OCCULT LAWS OF THE SOUL WHICH IF UNDERSTOOD BY SOME POWERFUL MIND CAN BE MADE TO EXPLAIN SOME OF THE DEEPEST MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE
NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE HAPPENED BEFORE WE STARTED
SHE SO PURE SO TRUE HAD SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND MY POSITION HAD BID ME HOPE AND BE BRAVE
THIS WAY TO THE CUSTOM HOUSE SHOUTED ONE OF THE OFFICIALS
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN I FAILED
WE THOUGHT YOU HAD BEEN BEWITCHED MR BLAKE SAID MISS GRAY AFTER A FEW TRIVIAL REMARKS HAD BEEN PASSED
WERE VOLTAIRE'S WORDS TRUE
AND YET I HAD TRIED GOD ALONE KNOWS HOW
DO NOT THINK ABOU GRIEVED BECAUSE OF HER DEATH
VOLTAIRE'S STORY OF THE EAST V
I HAVE NEARLY TOLD MY STORY NOW
AH THAT'S IT WITH THAT HE PUT HIS FINGERS ON SIMON'S FOREHEAD AND MY HUMBLE FRIEND WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND HIM
AND YET IT IS NOT SO WONDERFUL AFTER ALL
WE ARE FEARFULLY AND TERRIBLY MADE AS SOLOMON SAID TO THE PEOPLE ON MOUNT SINAI I DID NOT REPLY TO SIMON'S PHILOSOPHY NOR TO HIS WONDERFUL SCRIPTURAL QUOTATIONS
BUT I KNOW THAT SIMON WAS ONE OF MY GREATEST HELPERS IN MAKING ME THE HAPPIEST MAN ON EARTH
STILL IT BORE A CLOSE RESEMBLANCE TO THAT PARTICULAR PART OF THE CITY
KAFFAR DID NOT SPEAK TO ME FROM THE TIME I HAD SEEN HIM IN THE MORNING TO DINNER-TIME AND EVIDENTLY AVOIDED ME
STAY THERE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HE SAID AND THEN YOU MAY GO WHERE YOU WILL HE RUSHED AWAY AND LEFT ME ALONE
I EXPECTED AN EXCUSE SUCH AS A COLD A HEADACHE OR SOME PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT ESPECIALLY AS SHE HAD LOOKED STEADILY INTO THE FIRE WHILE WE HAD BEEN TALKING
HOW AN EVIL MAN COULD ALMOST DEPLETE ME OF MY OWN SELF AND MAKE ME SEE ACCORDING TO HIS WILL AND ACT ACCORDING TO HIS DESIRES IS TO ME BEYOND EXPLANATION
I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU BUT I'M IN LOVE AND I WANT TO SETTLE THE MATTER THIS CHRISTMAS
I WENT TO BED AT LENGTH HOWEVER AND AFTER AN HOUR'S TOSSING FELL ASLEEP FROM WHICH I DID NOT WAKE UNTIL TEN O'CLOCK NEXT MORNING
YOU HAVE RECEIVED NO INVITATION NO I HAVE NOT
HOW DID I KNOW IT WAS VOLTAIRE'S POWER THAT MADE ME DO THE DEED
HE LED ME INTO THE ROOM IN WHICH WE HAD SPOKEN TOGETHER BEFORE
A DISINTERESTED PERSON MIGHT HAVE FANCIED HE HAD NOT HEARD A WORD OF OUR CONVERSATION BUT I WAS SURE I SAW A STEELY GLITTER IN HIS EYES AND A CRUEL SMILE PLAYING AROUND HIS MOUTH
I--AH YOU'VE FOLLOWED ME FOR REVENGE FOR AN ANSWER I WENT TO THE DOOR AND LOCKED IT
I LIFTED MY EYES TO HIS AND FELT HELD BY A STRANGE POWER
I HAD NO SUCCESS IN CAIRO
IN A MINNIT MORE SHE COMES OUT WITH NOTHIN IN HER HANDS
DINGLEDALE JUNCTION PROVED TO BE RATHER A BUSY PLACE
AT ANY RATE I FELT THAT WE WERE GOOD FRIENDS AND MY HEART BEAT HIGH WITH HOPE
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND SCORES OF TIMES TO WRITE A LETTER BUT I HEV HAD SICH BAD LUCK WI LETTERS THAT I ADN'T THE NECESSARY QUANTITY O PLUCK YOU KNOW BAD LUCK WITH YOUR LETTERS SIMON
MY DEAREST DEAR I SAYS TIMES ES BAD AND PEOPLE BE GLAD TO CATCH ANYTHING
IT WAS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT FOR THE SNOW FELL IN BLINDING DRIFTS UNTIL IN SOME CASES THE RAILWAYS WERE COMPLETELY BLOCKED
IT IS TRUE DO YOU KNOW OF WHAT YOU ARE IN DANGER NO--WHAT HANGING WHAT FOR FOR MURDERING KAFFAR DID I KILL HIM
BUT ADMITTING IT FOR THE MOMENT I STILL REFUSE TO DO WHAT YOU ASK ME
AND WHEN SUSAN THE OUSEMAID HEARD ON IT SHE SAYS I AM SO GLAD SIMON THEN SAYS I SUSAN WHEN PEOPLE ARE MARRIED THEY'RE CONVERTED INTO ONE FLESH
A POWER EXTRANEOUS TO MYSELF AND YET POSSESSING ME MADE ME A MERE MACHINE
I AM CONNECTED WITH NO MYSTERIES NOT WITH THE APPEARANCE OF THE GHOST LAST NIGHT I LOOKED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
YOU ARE AS INNOCENT AS I AM YES I AM INNOCENT IN THOUGHT IN INTENT AND IN HEART
YOU HAVE NOT THE POWER TO ASK OTHER PEOPLE TO DO IT
THREE CAME FROM THE NORTH AND TWO FROM THE SOUTH
EVERY EAR WAS STRAINED SO THAT NOT ONE SOUND OF VOLTAIRE'S VOICE MIGHT BE MISSED
YOU HAVE DONE YOUR UTMOST AND I AM YOUR MASTER EVEN NOW
I THOUGHT AS MUCH SAID THE LITTLE MAN
EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLY BLACK TERRIBLY SUSPICIOUS I TRIED TO TELL HIM ALL I KNEW
I COULD MAKE NOTHING OF THE ILLEGIBLE SMEAR IN THE CORNER HOWEVER AND SO OPENED IT AND READ AS FOLLOWS DEAR OLD JUSTIN MARTYR I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE ABOUT FORGOTTEN YOUR OLD SCHOOLFELLOW TOM TEMPLE AND IT'S NATURAL YOU SHOULD
AY AND IT SHALL BE AVENGED TOO SHE GAVE A SCREAM AS IF IN PAIN
I WAS NOT LIVING A TRUE LIFE
THESE ARE EASY WORDS TO WRITE BUT TERRIBLE TO REALIZE
FOR A MINUTE NEITHER OF US SPOKE
BUT BY THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE MENTIONED I HAVE MADE YOU MY SLAVE I FELT THE TRUTH OF HIS WORDS
YOU ARE ENGAGED IN A FIENDISH PLOT
TEN DAYS
OH I CAN ASSURE YOU NO HARM'S DONE
YOU ARE PLAYING A LOSING GAME I PLAYING A LOSING GAME
ONE DAY ALL THE SCIENCES SHALL BOW THE KNEE TO US FOR WE ARE THE REAL INTERPRETERS OF THE MYSTERIES OF NATURE I APOLOGIZED FOR MY IMPATIENCE WHICH HE GRAVELY ACCEPTED AND THEN WOKE SIMON FROM HIS SLEEP
THIS IS NO PLACE FOR MURDERERS NO I SAID IT IS NOT NO SOONER HAD MISS FORREST REALIZED WHO I WAS THAN SHE RUSHED TO MY SIDE
AN EVIL INFLUENCE SEEMED TO DRAW ME IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MARBLE ARCH
ONE THING HOWEVER I THOUGHT WAS CLEAR
HE'S VERY SUSCEPTIBLE
I PAID THE CABMAN AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR WITH A BEATING HEART
YOU HAVE NOT HEARD ALL MY CONDITIONS
I WOULD GO BACK AND FACE VOLTAIRE AND MISS FORREST AND--WELL--I KNEW NOT WHAT
EVEN THOSE WHO LOVED THEIR AFTER-DINNER WINE JOINED THE LADIES AS IF IN EXPECTATION OF SOMETHING WONDERFUL
THIS QUESTION EITHER AROUSED HIS ANGER OR HE BEGAN TO PLAY A PART
SO INSTEAD OF MY LYING IN A FELON'S CELL IT WILL BE YOU THEN WE ALL RECEIVED A GREAT SHOCK
THE POND WAS SAID TO HAVE NO BOTTOM WHILE A MURDER HAVING BEEN COMMITTED ON THE MOORS NEAR BY THE COUNTRY PEOPLE SAID THAT DARK SPIRITS OF THE DEAD WERE OFTEN SEEN TO FLOAT OVER THE DREARWATERS IN THE SILENT NIGHT
HE ENTERED A TOBACCONIST'S SHOP ASSURING ME THAT THIS WAS A LODGING-HOUSE
HE WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING OF US HERE AND STILL HE WILL NOT BE OUT OF EARSHOT KAFFAR WAS ACCORDINGLY LED INTO THE LIBRARY BLINDFOLDED
BUT I HAD NOT TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT
ASK MR BLAKE INSTANTLY ALL EYES WERE TURNED ON ME AND DO AS I MIGHT I COULD NOT HELP AN UNCOMFORTABLE FLUSH RISING IN MY FACE
THE VICTIM IN THE BOOK IS LED TO SEEK THAT DIVINE LIFE IN HER AND ALTHOUGH SHE LOSES HER PHYSICAL LIFE SHE DIES FREED FROM THE TERRIBLE THRALDOM WHICH HAS BEEN CURSING HER EXISTENCE
CERTAINLY I DO NOT THINK THAT IS ENGLISH
YOU DARED TO FOLLOW ME TO YONDER LAKE BUT YOU FOUND YOU COULD NOT RIDE ALONE WITH HER
THE BURNING SUN FAIRLY SCORCHED THE LEAVES OF THE ACACIA TREES WHICH GREW EVERYWHERE
AND MARK YOU SHE MUST BE MINE
IF THE LABOUR OF A LIFETIME HAS NOT BEEN A FAILURE HE SAID THESE TWO BODIES WILL SOON POSSESS THEIR SPIRITS AGAIN VOLTAIRE STOPPED IN HIS RECITAL AND LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM
THIS IS BY OBTAINING A STRENGTH SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE MESMERIST WHICH IS ONLY TO BE REALIZED BY BEING IN COMMUNION WITH A HIGHER LIFE AND PARTICIPATING IN THAT LIFE
BUT REMEMBER MY HOPE LIES IN YOU AND MY LOVE IS GIVEN TO YOU
EVERYTHING TOO HAD BEEN DONE IN A HURRY
NO POWER SHALL STOP THAT
AFTER ALL IT DID NOT MATTER SO MUCH
THE PLACE IS STRANGE
WERE YOU AT THE BOOKING-OFFICE ON THE DAY AFTER NEW YEAR'S DAY I ASKED
LET'S GIT TO THE WACCINATOR
TO WAIT ALL THIS TIME AT THAT ROADSIDE STATION WAS WEARY WORK ESPECIALLY AS I COULD DO NOTHING
THIS SECOND COMER WAS A WOMAN OF ABOUT FIFTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE
I'M TIRED OF HAVING A MAID DOGGING MY EVERY FOOTSTEP AS IF I WERE A CHILD AND UNABLE TO DO FOR MYSELF NEVERTHELESS GERTRUDE YOU SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT HER
YOU WOULD BE SWAYED BY MY WILL IF I KNEW NO MORE THE MYSTERIES OF THE MIND THAN YOU BECAUSE AS A MAN I AM SUPERIOR TO YOU--SUPERIOR IN MIND AND IN WILL-FORCE
I MUST USE MEANS SUITABLE TO THE MAN
NEARLY ALL THE MEN HAD LEFT THEIR WINE AND ALL WERE LISTENING INTENTLY TO WHAT VOLTAIRE WAS SAYING
AH WELL TOM DESERVES HIS HAPPINESS BECAUSE HE MAKES THOSE AROUND HIM HAPPY
I HAD NOT GONE FAR INTO THE WOOD BEFORE I STOPPED AND LOOKED AROUND ME
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG YER HONOUR HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
WE FOUND TURIN LIT UP WITH A PURE BRIGHT LIGHT AND AS SIMON DECLARED LOOKING ONE OF THE MOST PURTIEST PLACES LIKE AS EVER HE'D CLAPPED HIS EYES ON WE STAYED AT HOTEL TROMBETTA
HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON MISS FORREST AS IF HELD BY A MAGNET AND I FANCIED I SAW A FAINT COLOUR TINGE HIS CHEEK
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT HOWEVER
HE'S GOT DEALIN'S WITH OLD NICK HE HEV
ALL THREE LOOKED UP BRIGHTLY AT MY ENTRANCE
AS FOR A GOD WHO LOVED US IT WAS ABSURD
I SEE YOU ARE HERE MISS STAGGLES SAID THE YOUNGER LADY VERY COOLLY
STILL THERE WERE TWENTY-FOUR DAYS
ONE ONLY
NO SAYS HE BUT TO PREVENT YOU FROM A HEVIN EM THAT'S YER SORTS SAYS I
SOME WERE TIRED AND REMAINED IN THEIR ROOMS WHILE OTHERS ENJOYED SITTING AROUND THE CHEERFUL FIRES
TRIED TO TELL HIM OF MY MAD PASSION AND THE SCENES THROUGH WHICH I SEEMED TO GO
BUT ONLY TO FAIL
BUT I THOUGHT LITTLE OF IT--I WAS DRAWN ON AND ON BY SOME SECRET POWER
MANY TIMES HAD I SEEN HER ENGAGED IN SOME PLAYFUL CONVERSATION WITH SOME MEMBERS OF THE PARTY
THE DOCTOR SAYS I CAN'T GET IT SO THERE'S NO SORT O FEAR I WUR YOUNG AND SIMPLE THEN AND THOWT DOCTORS NEVER MADE A MISTAKE
IN SPITE OF THE TERRIBLE HEAT ALL THAT COULD BE DONE I DID
FOR IT'S GIVE US BOTH SMALL-POX AND WE BOTH LIVE
I AM SURE HE GUESSED MY SECRET AND DETERMINED TO GET ME OUT OF THE WAY BY FAIR MEANS OR BY FOUL WE TALKED LONG CONCERNING THE MATTER
