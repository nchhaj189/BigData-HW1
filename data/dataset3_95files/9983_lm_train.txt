I DON'T AT ALL LIKE HIS COMING DOWN HERE AFTER MARK WYLDER
HA
HA
HA
HA
THE CART-ROAD LEADING DOWN TO REDMAN'S DELL AND PASSING THE MILLS NEAR REDMAN'S FARM DIVERGES FROM THE FOOTPATH WITH WHICH WE ARE SO WELL ACQUAINTED NEAR THAT PERPENDICULAR BLOCK OF STONE WHICH STANDS A LITTLE ABOVE THE STEPS WHICH THE FOOTPATH HERE DESCENDS
OF COURSE THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECULATIVE IN THE WHOLE TRANSACTION BUT HE HAD MADE HIS BOOK WELL AND BY HIS ARRANGEMENT WITH CAPTAIN LAKE WHICHEVER WAY THE TRUTH LAY HE STOOD TO WIN
NOTHING COULD BE MORE PERFECTLY DISTINCT THAN CHELFORD TRACED IN HER FAIR CORRESPONDENT'S VERY LEGIBLE HAND
CAN IT SAID HE WITH A PEEVISH MALIGNITY
WHEN HE TOOK THIS DECISIVE STEP LAKE'S NERVES WERE STRUNG I DARE SAY TO A HIGH PITCH OF EXCITEMENT
JUST LOOK THERE AND HE WAVED HIS FINGERS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CYCLOPEAN WALL OF TIN BOXES TIER ABOVE TIER EACH BEARING IN YELLOW ITALICS THE NAME OF SOME COUNTRY GENTLEMAN AND TWO BARONETS AMONG THE NUMBER
I DON'T THINK OF EXCUSES LADY CHELFORD
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT--VERY LITTLE MOON BUT THAT AND THE STARS WONDERFULLY CLEAR AND BRIGHT AND ALL THINGS LOOKING SO SOFT AND AIRY
AND RE-ENTERING HIS CAB HE DROVE A LONG WAY AND PAST ST PAUL'S AND CAME AT LAST TO A COURT OUTSIDE WHICH HE HAD TO DISMOUNT FROM HIS VEHICLE ENTERING THE GRIMY QUADRANGLE THROUGH A NARROW PASSAGE
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW HE FEELS TOWARDS ME
LARKIN AND THE VICAR
THUS IF THERE ARE AFFLICTIONS THERE ARE ALSO COMFORTS
IT WAS TWELVE O'CLOCK NOW
NOT BEING GIVEN TO THE FEAR OF LARVAE AND LEMURES AND ALSO KNOWING THAT A MISTAKE IS EASILY COMMITTED IN A GREAT HOUSE LIKE THAT AND THAT MY VISITOR MIGHT HAVE MADE ONE I GREW DROWSY IN A LITTLE WHILE AND SOON FELL ASLEEP AGAIN
BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE DONE TO HAVE KEPT A SECRET FROM CAPTAIN LAKE OF BRANDON
AND IF IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE DEAR RADIE WOULD YOU ALLOW ME TO SEE IT RACHEL OPENED HER DESK AND SILENTLY SELECTED ONE OF THOSE CLUMSY AND ORIGINAL MISSIVES DIRECTED IN A STAGGERING ROUND HAND ON PAPER ODDLY SHAPED AND THICK SUCH AS MIXES NOT NATURALLY WITH THE ARISTOCRATIC FABRIC ON WHICH CRESTS AND CIPHERS ARE IMPRESSED AND PLACED IT IN HER BROTHER'S HAND
HE LOOKED LIKE A GHOST--QUITE WHITE--SMILING
THE CAPTAIN WAS NOW ALL AT ONCE WALKING AT A SWIFT PACE ALONE TOWARDS LARCOM'S POST OF OBSERVATION AND HIS SECRET CONFEDERATE NEARLY AS RAPIDLY IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION
MR PAGE THE PERFORMER WAS A PLUMP YOUNG MAN WITH BLACK WHISKERS AND HIS HAIR IN OILY RINGLETS SUCH AS MAY BE SEEN IN THE MODEL WIGS PRESENTED ON SMILING WAXEN DANDIES IN MR ROSE'S FRONT WINDOW AT DOLLINGTON
I CARE LESS THAN YOU THINK HOW IT GOES NO STANLEY
YOU CAN SUPPOSE IN WHAT SHAPE
BEATEN'--THEN CAME AN OATH--'THREE VOTES--HOW THE DEVIL WAS THAT?--THERE IT IS BY JOVE--NO MISTAKE--MAJORITY AGAINST MINISTERS THREE
MY POOR CHILD--MY CHILD THAT I NURSED!--ANYTHING WOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS
NOW SOMETHING OF THIS NO DOUBT PASSED IN THE MINDS OF LORD CHELFORD AND HIS PRETTY COMPANION
BUT HANDSOME
YOU'RE BETTER DARLING
NOW STANLEY I CAN BEAR ANYTHING BUT THIS BASENESS--ANYTHING BUT THE LIFE-LONG PRACTICE OF PERFIDY--THAT I WILL NOT AND CANNOT ENDURE
WHO IS WITH YOU
HE DID NOT SAY SO INDEED
BUT A FELLOW KNOWS PRETTY WELL WHEN A GIRL LIKES HIM AND YOU KNOW THE MARRIAGE IS A SENSIBLE SORT OF THING AND I'M DETERMINED OF COURSE TO CARRY IT THROUGH
I MADE YOU A VOLUNTARY PROMISE DORCAS AND NOW YOU WILL MAKE ME ONE
AND HE SAID IT WAS THE OLD GENTLEMAN--OLD FLANNELS WE CALLS HIM FOR SHORTNESS--BUT LOR BLESS YOU SHE'S TOO USED TO HIM TO BE FRIGHTENED AND THAT'S ONLY A MAKE-BELIEF
SUCH NICE WHITE TEETH
SHE WATCHED HIS RETREATING FIGURE AS HE AND LITTLE FAIRY WALKED DOWN THE TENEBROSE ROAD TO GYLINGDEN FOLLOWING THEM WITH A DISMAL GAZE AS A BENIGHTED AND WOUNDED WAYFARER IN THAT VALLEY WOULD THE PALE LAMP'S DISAPPEARING THAT HAD FOR A FEW MINUTES IN A FRIENDLY HAND SHONE OVER HIS DREADFUL DARKNESS
HE WANTED TEETH AT BOTH SIDES AND THERE WAS RATHER A SKULL-LIKE CAVITY WHEN HE SMILED--WHICH WAS PRETTY OFTEN
WELL DO YOU TAKE MY OFFER I LAUGHED AND DECLINED TO HIS GREAT ELATION AND JUST THEN THE GONG SOUNDED AND WE WERE AWAY TO OUR TOILETS
BUT I'LL SHUT HIM UP AND THAT'S ALL
LARKIN IN THE GUISE OF CHARITY WAS PROSECUTING HIS DESIGNS UPON THE VICAR'S REVERSION AND OFTEN MOST CRUELLY AND MOST ARTFULLY WHEN HE FRANKLY FANCIED HIS CONDUCT MOST PRAISEWORTHY
A RED LETTER RED INK NO MISS RED PAPER WRITTEN WITH BLACK AND DIRECTED FOR YOU OH AND SO MISS IN MY DREAM I GAVE IT YOU IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
PARDON ME MISS LAKE THE BUSINESS TO WHICH I REFER IS REALLY URGENT VERY URGENT SIR IF IT CANNOT WAIT TILL TO-MORROW MORNING VERY TRUE QUITE TRUE VERY URGENT INDEED REPLIED THE ATTORNEY CALMLY
I WORK IN THE GARDEN I MEND MY DRESSES I DRINK TEA AND WHEN I CHOOSE TO BE DISSIPATED I PLAY AND SING FOR OLD TAMAR--WHY DID NOT YOU ASK HOW SHE IS
IT'S NO USE--I CAN'T READ IT TIME ENOUGH--I THINK YOU'VE READ MORE THAN IS GOOD FOR YOU
IT WAS NOT VERY ENCOURAGING
I LEFT HIM IN THE LIBRARY AND I AM SO VERY GLAD WE HAVE HAD A PLEASANTER REPORT UPON POOR LAKE THIS EVENING
HE DREW HIS DESPATCH-BOX NEARER TO HIM AFFECTIONATELY AS HE THOUGHT ON THE PRECIOUS RECORDS IT CONTAINED
DO YOU PROMISE THERE'S NO SUCH HASTE RADIE
AND AS TO MISS LAKE'S RESIDING WITH YOU--I SPEAK NOW YOU WILL UNDERSTAND IN THE STRICTEST CONFIDENCE BECAUSE THE SUBJECT IS A PAINFUL ONE
I THINK YOU ARE HALF MAD TAMAR
SHE HAD CERTAINLY MYSTIFIED RACHEL PERHAPS WAS MYSTIFYING HERSELF

THE YOUNG LADY WAS SO INTELLIGENT THAT WILLIAM WYLDER WAS OBLIGED TO EXERT HIMSELF IN CONTROVERSY WITH HER ELOQUENT DESPAIR
HE LAY ABOUT TWELVE FEET BELOW THE EDGE
WHEN HE WAS ALONE HE WAS AT ONCE IN A STATE OF FEVER AND GLOOM AND SEEMED ALWAYS WATCHING FOR SOMETHING
AND SO I AM
OLD TAMAR HOLDING HER CANDLE TO LIGHTEN HIS PATH AS SHE STOOD WHITE AND CADAVEROUS IN THE PORCH
HE SAW THE CAPTAIN TAKE FROM THE POCKET OF HIS PALETOT A SQUARE BOX OR PACKET IT MIGHT BE JEWELS OR ONLY PAPERS AND HAND THEM TO HIS COMPANION WHO POPPED THEM INTO HIS LEFT-HAND SURTOUT POCKET AND KEPT HIS HAND THERE AS IF THE FREIGHTAGE WERE SPECIALLY VALUABLE
GOOD-BYE FOR A LITTLE DORKIE AND HE LEANED OVER HER AND KISSED HER CHEEK AND THEN PASSED INTO THE HALL WHERE HE TOOK HIS HAT AND CANE
THERE WAS A GIG IN THE COURT-YARD WITH A GROOM AT THE HORSE'S HEAD AND LARKIN AS HE DREW UP SAW A CHAISE DRIVING ROUND TO THE STABLE YARD
AND IN FACT WERE IT NOT FOR SOME TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE WHICH I MAY MENTION--ALTHOUGH I DON'T SPEAK OF SUCH THINGS--I AFFORDED HIM MYSELF HE MUST HAVE BEEN RUINED IT IS VERY SAD SAID LAKE
AND AS HE READ THIS PLEASANT COMPOSITION THROUGH HE TWO OR THREE TIMES MURMURED APPROVINGLY YES--YES--YES HIS RECOLLECTION HAD SERVED HIM QUITE RIGHTLY
THERE'S ONLY ONE GOOD THING I CAN SAFELY SAY FOR MYSELF--I AM NO PHARISEE
IT DID NOT OF COURSE SURPRISE HIM BUT IT CONCLUSIVELY CORROBORATED ALL HIS INFERENCES
LARKIN TOSSED THE PAPER UPON THE SOFA
YES RACHEL I WILL--I'LL SAY EVERYTHING
I ASSURE YOU RADIE I THINK YOU ALL TO NOTHING THE PERVERSEST FOOL I EVER ENCOUNTERED OR HEARD OF IN THE COURSE OF MY LIFE WELL STANLEY SUPPOSE YOU DO I'LL NOT DISPUTE IT
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS INTRINSIC WORTH JIM WAS NOT POLISHED AND SPOKE MOREOVER AN UNCOUTH DIALECT WHICH BROKE OUT NOW AND THEN
UPON MY HONOUR AND CONSCIENCE AND SOUL CAPTAIN LAKE SAID THE ATTORNEY STRINGING TOGETHER IN HIS VINDICATION ALL THE ARTICLES HE WAS ASSUMED MOST TO RESPECT I AM PERFECTLY FRANK I DO ASSURE YOU
HIS TEMPER HIS CRAFT HIS IMPETUS WERE ALWAYS DRIVING HIM INTO PROJECTS AND SITUATIONS MORE OR LESS CRITICAL
WHO COULD HAVE FANCIED ANY SUCH STUPID HURRY
IT BORE THE BRANDON POSTMARK AND ALTOGETHER HAD THE IMPRESS OF AUTHENTICITY
IT WILL BRING ME A PRESENT AND A HINT TO SAY NOTHING OF MY HAVING SEEN HIM IN THE YEW-WALK AT THIS HOUR OF COURSE HE DID NOT RUN THROUGH ALL THIS RIGMAROLE IN DETAIL
HOW INGENIOUSLY PERVERSE THEIR WHIMSIES ARE
I AM VERY TIMIDLY DEFENDING IT AGAINST VERY SERIOUS ODDS ANSWERED HER SON
YOU TOLD ME SO I THINK
SHE MADE HIM RETURN
REFERRING TO THE LETTERS AS HE PROCEEDED WITH A SHARP PEN IN RED INK HE MADE HIS NATTY LITTLE NOTE UPON EACH TOWN OR CAPITAL IN SUCCESSION FROM WHICH WYLDER HAD DATED A DESPATCH
BUT HIS SUMMONS AND THE PROVOCATION DIED AWAY TOGETHER IN THE PROFOUNDEST SILENCE
BUT THE WILD AND MENACING LOOK WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND ONLY THE REFLECTION OF THE DARK SPECULATIONS AND PASSIONS WHICH WERE TUMBLING AND BREAKING IN HIS SOUL
HE WAS THINKING OF CAPTAIN LAKE WHO WAS OPPOSITE AND LIKE HIM PRAYING
ASK A GENTLEMAN FOR HIS ESTATE OR WATCH BECAUSE I KNOW SOMETHING TO HIS DISADVANTAGE
HE DINED LIKE A KING IN DISGUISE AT THE HUMBLE LITTLE HOSTELRY OF NAUNTON FRIARS AND RETURNED IN THE TWILIGHT TO THE LODGE WHICH HE WOULD MAKE THE DOWER-HOUSE OF FIVE OAKS WITH THE HOWARD SHIELD OVER THE DOOR
AND WHAT MADE IT WORSE IT WAS A MATTER CONNECTED WITH THE DEATH OF POOR LADY BRACTON
THE TIME IS COMING DORCAS WHEN YOU WILL KNOW ALL AND MAYBE JUDGE ME MERCIFULLY
WHAT ABOUT RADIE
ARE YOU ILL DORKIE HE MIGHT WELL ASK FOR SHE APPEARED ON THE POINT OF FAINTING
ARE ANY OF YOUR PEOPLE GOING TO BRANDON THIS MORNING I'LL SEND IT SAID THE LAWYER EYEING THE LITTLE PENCILLED NOTE WISTFULLY WHICH LAKE PRESENTED BETWEEN TWO FINGERS
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND
THOU SHALT NOT COVET
I AM ALWAYS UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN YOU ARE NEAR ME
LARKIN SMILED--THE SMILE SAID PLAINLY WHAT WOULD HE HAVE ME LIVE UPON AND WHERE WE DO MEET PERSONS OF THIS SORT WHO WOULD FAIN FILL OUR BELLIES WITH THE HUSKS THAT SWINE DIGEST
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE PRUDENT OF US--DO YOU?--TO QUARREL WITH MARK WYLDER AND HE DOES NOT WISH OUR MEETING KNOWN
IT WAS A SIGHT TOO FAMILIAR TO DECEIVE THE NURSE
I WAS TWICE HERE IN ENGLAND AND THREE TIMES ABROAD FOR WHOM MR MARK WYLDER ANSWERED HE
IL EST TUE--IL SE MEURT--HE DIES--D'UN COUP DE PISTOLET
I'VE A GREAT MIND TO BURN IT QUIETLY BUT HE APPLIED HIS MATCH INSTEAD TO HIS CIGAR
OR WITHIN THE LAST WEEK?--NO
I ONLY SAID A PART REPLIED STANLEY
YOU DO LOOK WOFULLY SICK THOUGH
OF A SPECTRE WHOM OLD TAMAR SAW
I SAY HE SHALL RADIE HAS HE LOST HIS WITS
OF COURSE I COULD NOT THINK OF DEPRIVING MYSELF OF CANDLE-LIGHT
IS IT MARTIN OF THE CHINA KILNS OR MARTIN OF THE BANK
MY OWN SOLICITOR IS RETAINED IN THE CASE MR LARKIN'S COUNTENANCE DARKENED AND LENGTHENED VISIBLY AND HIS EYES ASSUMED THEIR MOST UNPLEASANT EXPRESSION AND THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE DURING WHICH FORGETTING HIS LOFTY WAYS HE BIT HIS THUMB-NAIL RATHER VICIOUSLY
IT WAS AMAZING HOW SO MANY VOTERS COULD FIND ROOM TO ONE COUNTY
THAT DOES NOT STRIKE ME AS ANY PART OF YOUR RELIGION TAMAR GROANED AGAIN AND SHE SAID
WHO HAVE YOU GOT IN THE ROOMS WELL JOS
BUT I'LL BEAT ABOUT FOR THE MONEY IN THE WAY OF LOAN IF POSSIBLE AND ONE WAY OR ANOTHER I AM RESOLVED IF THE THING'S TO BE DONE TO GET HIM STRAIGHT THERE WAS HERE A LITTLE PAUSE AND MR LARKIN FINDING THAT MISS LAKE HAD NOTHING TO SAY SIMPLY ADDED AND SO FOR THESE REASONS AND WITH THESE VIEWS MY DEAR MISS LAKE WE BEG MOST RESPECTFULLY AND I WILL SAY GRATEFULLY TO DECLINE THE PROFFERED ADVANCE WHICH I WILL SAY AT THE SAME TIME DOES HONOUR TO YOUR FEELINGS I AM SORRY SAID MISS LAKE YOU HAVE HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE IN EXPLAINING SO SIMPLE A MATTER
AND IF IT LIES BETWEEN HIM AND ME I WILL UNDOUBTEDLY OFFER MYSELF AND ACCOMPANY MY ADDRESS WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THIS PRECIOUS DOCUMENT WHICH HE CALLS HIS NOTICE--THE COMPOSITION IN ALL RESPECTS OF A RUFFIAN--AND WHICH WILL INSPIRE EVERY GENTLEMAN WHO READS IT WITH DISGUST ABHORRENCE AND CONTEMPT
AND REQUESTING HER SON'S INTERFERENCE
OF COURSE IF THERE ARE PERSONS TO BE DEALT WITH WHO ARE NOT PLEASANTLY APPROACHABLE BY RESPECTABLE PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE--IN FACT IT WOULD NOT SUIT ME
CAN'T YOU LET ME MANAGE HIM THE OLD MAN DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR WHAT THEY SAID
HE CERTAINLY HAD NOT BEEN AT THE LARK'S NEST WHICH WAS KEPT BY THE MARKER'S VENERABLE PARENT AND WAS A FAVOURITE HAUNT OF THE GAY LIEUTENANT
THEY HAVE CALLED ME TO COUNSEL MORE THAN ONCE POOR FELLOWS
LARKIN NOW SAW THE GLITTER OF A PAIR OF EYES GAZING AT HIM HE FANCIED
NOWT ANSWERED THE MAN BLUFFLY ONLY I WRIT TO MR LARKIN THERE AS I WANTED TO SEE HIM
AND IF LOVED A LITTLE--IT SHOULD BE NOT AT ALL THEY HAD THE ROAD ALL TO THEMSELVES AND WERE GOING AT A WALK UP AN ASCENT SO THE REINS LAY LOOSELY ON THE PONIES NECKS AND DORCAS LOOKED WITH AN UNTOLD MEANING IN HER PROUD FACE ON HER COUSIN AND SEEMED ON THE POINT OF SPEAKING BUT SHE CHANGED HER MIND
GRADUALLY IN A MORE AUTHENTIC SHAPE INFORMATION TRACEABLE TO OLD LADY CHELFORD THROUGH SOME OF THE OLD COUNTY FAMILIES WHO VISITED AT BRANDON MADE IT KNOWN THAT MR WYLDER'S AFFAIRS WERE NOT AT PRESENT BY ANY MEANS IN SO SETTLED A STATE AS WAS SUPPOSED
HE'S IN THE HANDS OF BURLINGTON SMITH AND COMPANY
AND HE'S ALWAYS LISTENING AND STARES SO
NO CHARLIE
AND SOMEHOW I NEVER GOT VERY FAR INTO THE PROS AND CONS OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WHICH SOON SUBSIDED INTO THE FAIRY TALE I HAVE MENTIONED AND THAT SWEET PERPENDICULAR SLEEP--ALL THE SWEETER LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE FOR BEING CONTRABAND AND IRREGULAR
AND I SUPPOSE HE WILL EXPECT PAYMENT FOR HIS NO-TROUBLE
HO THEN WE'LL HAVE THE WRITS DOWN HOT AND HEAVY
AND AT THE INSTANT I FELT MYSELF SEIZED BY THE THROAT AND UNABLE TO STIR OR TO BREATHE
EACH UNDERSTOOD THAT THE CONVERSATION ON THAT THEME WAS ENDED AND SOMEHOW EACH WAS RELIEVED
NO TANT MIEUX I HATE THEM SAID THE CAPTAIN
AND THE TIME IS COMING WHEN IN SPITE OF HIS MANOEUVRING I'LL DRIVE HIM INTO A CORNER AND PIN HIM TO THE WALL
LARKIN WITH ONE OF HIS YOUNG MEN WITH HIM IN THE TAX-CART REACHED BRANDON HALL IN A MARVELLOUSLY SHORT TIME AFTER HIS ARRIVAL AT HOME
I TOOK A DISLIKE TO HIM AT FIRST SIGHT LONG AGO AND THAT NEVER HAPPENED ME BUT I WAS RIGHT WYLDER LOOKED CONFOUNDEDLY ANGRY AND FLUSTERED STANDING WITH HIS HEELS ON THE EDGE OF THE RUG HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS JINGLING SOME SILVER THERE AND GLANCING FROM UNDER HIS RED FOREHEAD STERNLY AND UNSTEADILY ACROSS THE ROOM
THIS SHUT UP THE ADMIRABLE MAN WHO NEXT TRIED A RATHER BOLD MEASURE DIRECTED AGAINST THE REVEREND WILLIAM WYLDER
HE STRETCHED HIS HAND TO HELP HER UP
I ONLY KNOW FOR CERTAIN I TOOK IT SO
POOR OLD TAMAR SAYS HER PRAYERS AND READS HER BIBLE
I MUST HAVE EXPRESSED MYSELF VERY ILL IF I SUGGESTED ANYTHING SO TRAGICAL
YOU ARE A KIND LITTLE MAN AND I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MOMENT SAID THE VICAR SMILING VERY LOVINGLY ON HIS NAUGHTY LITTLE MAN
I MEAN TO CALL TO-MORROW OR NEXT DAY OR SOME DAY SOON AT REDMAN'S FARM
AFTER DINNER HE GOT INTO A CAB AND DROVE TO MARK WYLDER'S CLUB
AND THEN HE MENTIONED THAT HIS FRIEND CAPTAIN LAKE WHO WAS STAYING WITH HIM AT HIS HOUSE AT GYLINGDEN WAS ALSO VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH HIS ACCOMMODATION WHEN HE TOO AT LAWYER LARKIN'S RECOMMENDATION HAD PUT UP FOR A NIGHT AT JOHNSON'S HOTEL
AND I HEARD YOU SPEAK AGAIN BY MY ROOM DOOR ONLY A WEEK BEFORE YOUR MARRIAGE WHEN YOU THOUGHT I WAS ASLEEP
MY DARLING YOU MUST SIT DOWN
BUT A STROLL WITH A LORD WAS WORTH MORE THAN THAT SACRIFICE AND EVERY INCIDENT WHICH HELPED TO MAKE A COLOURABLE CASE OF CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONS AT BRANDON--A POINT IN WHICH THE GOOD ATTORNEY HAD BEEN RATHER WEAK HITHERTO--WAS JUSTLY PRIZED BY THAT VIRTUOUS MAN
I DO NOT EXCEPT IN FACT ANY
AND I THINK I WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM THE STORY OF MY ADVENTURE DESPITE THE SECRET RIDICULE WITH WHICH I FANCIED HE WOULD RECEIVE IT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR A CERTAIN INSURMOUNTABLE DISGUST AND HORROR WHICH HELD ME TONGUE-TIED UPON THE AFFAIR
I GLANCED THE OTHER WAY AND THOUGHT I SAW--THOUGH NOT DISTINCTLY--IN THE DISTANCE A WHITE FIGURE NOT GLIDING IN THE CONVENTIONAL WAY BUT LIMPING OFF WITH A SORT OF JERKY MOTION AND IN A SECOND OR TWO QUITE LOST IN DARKNESS
AND DORCAS AND RACHEL KISSED THEIR HANDS AND SMILED AND AWAY THE CARRIAGE GLIDED
AND I MUST INSIST STANLEY ON CONSULTING CHELFORD BEFORE TAKING ANY STEP
I HAVE SAID IT
HE TALKED OF HIS FIANCEE AS HE MIGHT OF AN OPERA-GIRL ALMOST AND WAS NOW DISCUSSING MISS LAKE IN THE SAME STYLE
BURLINGTON AND SMITH TO THAT EFFECT
I QUITE ALLOW I WAS WRONG--WORSE THAN WRONG--BUT WHERE IS THE USE OF ATTACKING ME NOW WHEN I'M IN THIS DREADFUL FIX
IT STRUCK MR LARKIN THAT HIS GALLANT FRIEND WAS A LITTLE OVERACTING AND SHOWING PERHAPS LESS INTEREST IN THE DISCOVERY THAN WAS STRICTLY NATURAL
I CAN ADMIRE YOU AND UNDERSTAND YOU AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU I'VE BEEN WITH WILLIAM WYLDER AND DOLLY
YET I THOUGHT I COULD EVEN IN THAT DIM GLIMPSE DISCERN HOW THE SILENT SUBTERRANEAN CURRENT OF HER THOUGHTS WAS FLOWING
NONE IN THE WORLD
IF YOU HAVE PUZZLED YOURSELF YOU HAVE ALSO PUZZLED ME
I SOMETIMES INDEED RECEIVE A MALE VISITOR AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PALING WHICH IS MY GRILLE
WYLDER LONDON IT WAS EVIDENTLY WRITTEN IN GREAT HASTE WITH THE BROAD-NIBBED PEN HE LIKED
LARKIN GREW MORE AND MORE UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THE UNEXPECTED INTERPOSITION OF RACHEL LAKE AS THE DAY WORE ON
AND YOU LOOK TIRED
IF YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST REGARD FOR YOUR OWN HONOUR YOU WILL NOT PRECIPITATE THAT MEASURE MISS LAKE
BUT RHEUMATISM ARRESTED HER INDIGNANT FLIGHT
MARK ME THOUGH I'LL GO NO FURTHER IN THE LONG ROUTE OF WICKEDNESS YOU SEEM TO HAVE MARKED OUT FOR ME
AND SADDUCEES ALTHOUGH THEY BELIEVE NEITHER IN THE RESURRECTION NOR THE JUDGMENT ARE NO MORE PROOF THAN OTHER MEN AGAINST THE RESURRECTIONS OF MEMORY AND THE PENALTIES OF ASSOCIATION AND OF FEAR
THERE IF YOU PLEASE SAID THE ATTORNEY ONCE MORE
BUT ONE DAY IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER
AND I DON'T THINK YOU WILL CHARGE ME WITH WANT OF ZEAL IN YOUR BUSINESS OH
WERE YOU TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE OH
THERE SHE IS NOW BUSY IN HER TINY GARDEN WITH THE BIRDS TWITTERING ABOUT HER AND THE YELLOW LEAVES FALLING
BUT THIS SORT OF MUSING AND WONDERMENT LEADS TO NOTHING
BUT IT GROWS LATE I RATHER THINK AND THE TRUSTEES OF OUR LITTLE WESLEYAN CHAPEL--WE'VE GOT A LITTLE INTO DEBT IN THAT QUARTER I AM SORRY TO SAY--AND I PROMISED TO ADVISE WITH THEM THIS EVENING AT NINE O'CLOCK
THEN FOR NEARLY TEN MINUTES HE SMOKED--AN ODD RECREATION FOR A MAN SUFFERING FROM THE CIGARS OF LAST NIGHT--AND AFTER THAT FOR NEARLY AS LONG AGAIN HE SEEMED LOST IN DEEP THOUGHT HIS EYES UPON THE MISTY GRASS BEFORE HIM AND HIS SMALL FRENCH BOOT BEATING TIME TO THE MUSIC OF HIS THOUGHTS
HE WAS A MIRACLE OF A CHILD
THEY WERE NOT LIQUORICE
CARTER WITH WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE HAD FURNISHED HIM
LARKIN ESQUIRE BRANDON MANOR IF YOU PLEASE AND TO SEE THE PEOPLE READ THE INSCRIPTION IN THE HALL OF HIS DINGY HOSTELRY
BUT ALL HUMAN PAIN HAS ITS INTERVALS OF RELIEF
AND RACHEL SEEMED TO HAVE QUITE PASSED FROM HIS RECOLLECTION
THESE ARRANGEMENTS HOWEVER WERE DISCONCERTED BY MISS LAKE'S SITTING DOWN AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE AND QUIETLY REQUESTING MR LARKIN TO OPEN HIS CASE
HE HAS LEFT THE UNITED SERVICE
AS THEY GOT ON THERE WAS MORE NIGHT FOG AND THE LITTLE LAMP AT TOP SHONE THROUGH A HALO
WHAT CAN HE MEAN
NOW RADIE IF YOU WISH TO WRITE SIT DOWN HERE--OR IF YOU PREFER A MESSAGE THOMAS CAN TAKE ONE VERY ACCURATELY
BUT THEN I OWE IT AND I COULD NOT AS S A CHRISTIAN MAN YOU KNOW EVADE MY DEBTS OF COURSE
MY OLD BONES HAVE CARRIED ME HERE--'TIS YEARS SINCE I WALKED SO FAR
I TOLD YOU THIS MORNING IT WAS A HOLIDAY AND HE LAUGHED VERY QUIETLY TO HIMSELF
HE WAS NOW LOOKING DOWN WITH HIS SLY MALIGN SMILE
MAYBE HE HAS RETURNED HE DID NOT BELIEVE IT THOUGH
AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD SEE NOTHING NOTICEABLE IN STANLEY'S DEMEANOUR HE COULD HAVE FELT IT IN HIS HEART TO BOX HIS EARS
HE'S HIS OWN MASTER OF COURSE
AND DORCAS STANDING ON THE STEPS LOOKED AFTER IT VERY SADLY
YOU WANT TO EXTORT SOME ADVANTAGE FROM WYLDER
IT WAS KNOWN TO BE QUITE FINAL AND AS THE LADY EVINCED NO CHAGRIN AND AFFECTED NO UNUSUAL SPIRITS BUT HELD SWANLIKE AND MAJESTIC THE EVEN TENOR OF HER WAY THERE WAS ON THE WHOLE LITTLE DOUBT ANYWHERE THAT THE GENTLEMAN HAD RECEIVED HIS CONGE AND WAS HIDING HIS MORTIFICATION AND HEALING HIS WOUNDS IN PARIS OR VIENNA OR SOME OTHER SUITABLE RETREAT
LADY CHELFORD EXTENDED HER LONG SHRIVELLED FINGERS ON WHICH GLIMMERED SUNDRY JEWELS AND MADE A LITTLE NOD TO HER SON WHO GAVE IT TO HER WITH A SMILE
SO THOUGHT THIS GOOD MAN COMPLACENTLY
BRANDON CHAPEL ON SUNDAY
I TELL YOU WHAT CHARLIE BETWEEN YOU AND ME THAT FELLOW STANLEY IS A D----D BAD LOT
HE COULD GIVE PARTICULARS AS TO THAT
RIDICULOUS LITTLE PUDGY BUDDLE--HOW AWFUL ON A SUDDEN ARE YOU GROWN--THE INTERPRETER OF DEATH IN THIS VERY CASE
AND MY FRIEND LAKE--CAPTAIN LAKE--NOW UNHAPPILY IN SO VERY PRECARIOUS A STATE APPEARS TO DISLIKE THE OFFICE ALSO AND TO ANTICIPATE ANNOYANCE IN THE EVENT OF HIS CONSENTING TO ACT
BUT SHE SHOWED ALWAYS A QUEENLIKE INDIFFERENCE ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT THINK OR OBSERVE
A HAEMORRHAGE PERHAPS A SUDDEN SHIVERING AND INFLAMMATION--A SINKING MAYBE OR DELIRIUM--SOME AWFUL CHANGE PROBABLY--FOR BUDDLE DID NOT RETURN
THE FIFTEENTH--JUST TEN CLEAR DAYS
THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE ROAD I COULD NOT PASS SOMETHING
GOOD-NIGHT AND HE LIGHTED A BED-ROOM CANDLE AND LEFT THE ROOM
I BEG YOUR PARDON DEAR TAMAR BUT YOU MUST FIRST TELL ME THAT STORY YOU USED TO TELL ME LONG AGO OF LADY RINGDOVE THAT LIVED IN EPPING FOREST TO WHOM THE GHOST CAME AND TOLD SOMETHING SHE WAS NEVER TO REVEAL AND WHO SLOWLY DIED OF THE SECRET GROWING ALL THE TIME MORE AND MORE LIKE THE SPECTRE
HE DOES NOT LIKE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT HE'S ABOUT
NOW UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THIS ENQUIRY A THING STRUCK MR LARKIN STRANGELY ENOUGH WHICH HE HAD QUITE OVERLOOKED BEFORE
THOSE FELLOWS WITH THE RED CROSS BEFORE HAVE PROMISED YES
RACHEL TOOK THE KEY WITH A FAINT GLEAM OF SCORN ON HER FACE AND BROUGHT OUT THE WINE IN SILENCE
I VENTURE TO SAY STANLEY YOUR PLANS ARE ALL FOR YOURSELF
SOME FELLOW PERHAPS WATCHING FOR A FRIEND--OR TRICKS MAYBE THEN THE ATTORNEY TRYING HIS SUPERCILIOUS SMILE IN THE DARK LISTENED AGAIN FOR A GOOD WHILE BUT NOTHING WAS HEARD EXCEPT THOSE WHISPERINGS OF THE WIND WHICH POETS SPEAK OF
THE VICAR HAD BEEN SENT FOR TO NAUNTON TO PRAY WITH A DYING PERSON
IT IS A PITY HE IS NOT QUITE STRAIGHT OR AT LEAST MORE PUNCTUAL IN HIS MONEY AFFAIRS HE IS DISTRESSED FOR MONEY
WHEN I HAD REACHED MY LODGINGS AFTER MY LITTLE EXCURSION UP THE RHINE UPON MY TABLE THERE LAY AMONG THE REST ONE LETTER--THERE GENERALLY IS IN AN OVERDUE BUNDLE--WHICH I VIEWED WITH SUSPICION
I MUST SEE YOU THROUGH THE ENCHANTED DELL--IT IS ONLY A STEP--AND THEN I SHALL RETURN WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE LIKE A WORTHY KNIGHT HAVING DONE MY DEVOIR HONESTLY SHE LOOKED DOWN THE DELL WITH A DARK AND PAINFUL GLANCE AND THEN SHE SAID A FEW WORDS OF HESITATING APOLOGY AND ACQUIESCENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THEY PARTED AT THE LITTLE WICKET OF REDMAN'S FARM
HE MAY EXPECT--HA HA HA
IT WAS SIMPLY RACHEL'S LETTER TO HER FRIEND DOLLY WYLDER ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ATTORNEY'S CONFERENCE WITH HER AT REDMAN'S FARM
DO YOU MEAN THAT SAID RACHEL TURNING A TONE OF SUDDEN SURPRISE AND ENERGY ALMOST HORROR TURNING FULL UPON HIM AND STOPPING SHORT
YOU'RE POOR ENOUGH
AFTER ALL I HAVE DONE AND SUFFERED SAID SHE WITH A FAINT SMILE OF UNIMAGINABLE BITTERNESS
WELL CERTAINLY NEITHER HAD YOU IT WAS ALL THE DEVIL
I HOPE IT DID HIM GOOD
EH
I AM YOUR WIFE
OH POOR STANLEY--POOR STANLEY DRINK THIS WATER DARLING
NO GOOD WILL EVER HAPPEN US AND I MUST GO LIKE THE REST THERE WAS A SHORT SILENCE AND RACHEL GAZED ON THE CARPET IN TROUBLED REFLECTION AND THEN WITH AN ANXIOUS LOOK SHE TOOK HER COUSIN'S HAND AND SAID DORCAS YOU MUST THINK OF THIS NO MORE
I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID OF HIM
IN WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE VISITS HIS SISTER'S SICK BED
DRIVER HAS BEEN ALWAYS CORRECT
HE COULD NOT AT ANY TIME HAVE VERY WELL DEFINED HIS FEELINGS TOWARD HIS SISTER BUT MINGLING IN THEM CERTAINLY WAS A VEIN OF UNACKNOWLEDGED DREAD AND SHALL I SAY RESPECT
LET IT BE A DEPOSITION DO YOU MIND
STANLEY YOU MUST SPEAK TRUTH
WITNESSES
THE OLD WOMAN WITH HER SHAWL OVER HER HEAD SAT LISTENING FOR HER YOUNG MISTRESS'S APPROACH ON THE LITTLE SIDE BENCH IN THE TRELLISED PORCH AND TOTTERED HASTILY FORTH TO MEET HER AT THE GARDEN WICKET WHISPERING FORLORN WELCOMES AND THANKSGIVINGS WHICH RACHEL ANSWERED ONLY WITH A KISS
BUT WE COULD NOT MOVE HIM FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE LAY WITHOUT INFLICTING SO MUCH PAIN THAT WE WERE OBLIGED TO WAIT FOR ASSISTANCE
HA HA HA I'LL NOT DEBATE WITH YOU WYLDER ON THAT STUPID OLD QUESTION
LADY CONSTANCE
AND HE SIGHED AGAIN IN THE DELICIOUS LUXURY OF HAVING SECURED BOTH HEAVEN AND MAMMON
BUT THAT FEELING--THE--MY POOR LITTLE MAN
I S'POSE SIR YOU WERE VIEWING THE BODY WHAT BODY MR WYLDER'S PLEASE SIR THE VICAR EXCLAIMED MR LARKIN HIS SMILE OF CONDESCENSION SUDDENLY VANISHING
SHE TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND HE SHOOK HERS MECHANICALLY LIKE A MAN RESCUED FROM SHIPWRECK AND PLAINLY NOT RECOLLECTING HIMSELF WELL
THE STABLES OF THE BRANDON ARMS OF THE GEORGE INN OF THE SILVER LION EVEN OF THE WHITE HOUSE THOUGH A GOOD WAY OFF AND GENERALLY EVERY VACANT STANDING FOR HORSES IN OR ABOUT THE TOWN WERE CROWDED
SO AS LARKIN WALKED DOWN THE PLATFORM THE WHISTLE SOUNDED AND THE TRAIN GLIDED FORWARD AND AS IT PASSED HIM THE GENTLEMAN IN THE CLOAK AND QUEER HAT WAS LOOKING OUT
SHE WOULD HAVE SCREAMED IN THE EXTREMITY OF HER TERROR BUT THAT HER VOICE FOR SOME SECONDS TOTALLY FAILED HER
AND I HAVE ARRANGED IMMEDIATELY ON HIS ARRIVAL AT HIS DESIRE TO MEET HIM PROFESSIONALLY AND TO HEAR THE ENTIRE NARRATIVE BOTH OF WHAT HE KNOWS AND OF WHAT HE SUSPECTS AS JOS
AND RECOGNISING HER BROTHER THOUGH LIKE RHODA IN HOLY WRIT SHE DOUBTED WHETHER IT WAS NOT HIS ANGEL SHE ROSE UP AND WITH AN AWFUL EJACULATION SHE APPROACHED THE WINDOW
I'M GLAD YOU'RE COME CHARLIE
STANLEY VOLUNTEERED TO ASSURE ME HE HAD NOT THE FAINTEST IDEA OF LOOKING FOR A CONSTITUENCY
IF THAT SCOUNDREL HAD COME TO KILL US YOU COULD NOT CRY OUT LOUDER HE WHISPERED WITH AN OATH
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM ALMOST
STANLEY LOOKED ROUND HIM WITH PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES
IF YOU HAD PUT IT LIKE A BIT OF NEWS IN GALIGNANI I WOULD HAVE SEEN IT AND KNOWN WHAT TO DO
BUT HE HAD BEEN FIFTY TIMES OVER DURING HIS BRIEF CAREER IN SCRAPES OF A VERY MENACING KIND
HE WAS SEATED IN THAT SMALL ROOM OR CLOSET WHICH HE HAD YEARS AGO APPROPRIATED AS HIS PRIVATE APARTMENT
DOWN CAME THE BRANDON BOXES
STILL SHE WAS STANLEY'S SISTER AND TO BE TREATED ACCORDINGLY
AND IF YOU PLEASE TO LET HIM RUN HIS EYE ALSO OVER THIS NOTE TO YOU AS I HAVE MY OWN REASONS FOR WISHING HIM TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SEEN IT
I KNOW YOU'LL COME WELL RACHEL DID GO
AND COULD NO MORE POSTPONE IT WHEN THE TIME CAME THAN HE COULD ADJOURN AN ECLIPSE
OH MASTER STANLEY MASTER STANLEY
I DON'T SEE WHY IT SHOULD
I MAY SEE YOU TO TELL THE STORY IN FOUR WEEKS TIME
AFTER ALL TWAS NO PARTICULAR BUSINESS OF MINE
I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY LENDER IN FACT WOULD ENTERTAIN SUCH A SECURITY
HE HAS NOT COME AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SHOW ANY ANXIETY ABOUT IT REPLIED THE ATTORNEY TAKING THE CAPTAIN'S THIN HAND RATHER DEFERENTIALLY
BUT HE CHECKED THE RISING DEVIL WITHIN HIM AND CHANGED HIS TONE
PERHAPS YOU WOULD TAKE A LITTLE TURN ON THE GREEN--I MUST CALL FOR A MOMENT AT THE READING-ROOM--AND I'LL EXPLAIN
I_'LL NOT UNDERTAKE YOUR EXCUSES I PROMISE YOU EXCUSES
THEY'RE NOT QUARRELLING NO WAYS MURMURED HE
IS NOT THAT IT MISS LAKE AND--AND YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE DREADFUL TO SELL IT ALL FOR NEXT TO NOTHING IS NOT THAT WHAT YOU MEAN MISS LAKE--RACHEL DEAR I MEAN YES DOLLY STRIPPING YOURSELVES OF A SPLENDID INHERITANCE AND ROBBING YOUR POOR LITTLE BOY
STANLEY WAS ALWAYS IMPRACTICABLE PERVERSE DECEITFUL AND SO FOOLISH WITH ALL HIS CUNNING AND SUSPICION--SO VERY FOOLISH
I GLANCED ROUND FOR WYLDER BUT HE WAS NOT THERE
I KNEW MY FRIEND MR LARKIN WOULD BE ONLY TOO GLAD OF AN OPINION IN THIS DIFFICULTY FROM YOU THREW IN THE VICAR
SHARP DARK AND STRANGE LAY THAT FAMILIAR FACE UPON THE WHITE PILLOW
PERHAPS IT WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH MORE EXCITING IDEAS
CHAPTER XLVII
LARKINS HAD SPECULATED THUS AND BUILT RICH BUT SOMBRE CASTLES IN THE AIR FOR SOME TIME LONGER HE SAID QUIETLY TO HIMSELF YES AND THEN HE ORDERED HIS DOG-CART AND DROVE OFF TO DOLLINGTON AND PUT UP AT JOHNSON'S HOTEL WHERE STANLEY LAKE HAD SLEPT ON THE NIGHT OF HIS SISTER'S RETURN FROM LONDON
I OWN I DID FEEL TOWARDS THIS LADY WHO EITHER WAS OR SEEMED TO ME SO SINGULAR A MYSTERIOUS INTEREST JUST BEGINNING--OF THAT PECULIAR KIND WHICH BECOMES AT LAST TERRIBLY ABSORBING
WHILE THESE YOUNG LADIES ARE DISCUSSING STANLEY LAKE I MAY BE PERMITTED TO MENTION MY OWN ESTIMATE OF THAT AGREEABLE YOUNG PERSON
HOW'S THIS AND MR LARKIN LOOKED AS MUCH SCARED AND ASTONISHED AS IF A SPIRIT ROSE UP BEFORE HIM
BY-THE-BYE RADIE YOU MENTIONED OUR OLD SERVANT WHOM MY FATHER THOUGHT SO HIGHLY OF--JIM DUTTON--THE OTHER EVENING
NOTHING MORE OF THE BODY TO WHICH IT BELONGED EXCEPT THE POINT OF A KNEE IN STAINED AND MUDDY TROUSERS PROTRUDING FROM THE PEAT WAS VISIBLE
IN FACT HE WAS THEN AND THERE FULLY APPRISING HIM OF HIS AWFUL SITUATION
I MUST GO AND ASK HER HOW SHE DOES SHE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT HOLDING HER BOUQUET DROOPING TOWARDS THE FLOOR AND LOOKING WITH HER CLOUDED EYES DOWN--DOWN--THROUGH IT
SO SHE SMILED UPON THE PICTURE PAINTED ON THE CLOUDS
SO IN REPLY TO HER QUESTIONS THE VICAR TOLD HER FRANKLY HOW HE STOOD
SO I JUMPED TO THE GROUND AND WAS GREETED VERY KINDLY BY THE SMOKERS
AND SO SURE AS YOU PERSIST IN YOUR UNWARRANTABLE DESIGN OF RESIDING IN THAT UNSUSPECTING FAMILY I WILL PUBLISH WHAT I SHALL THEN FEEL CALLED UPON BY MY POSITION TO MAKE KNOWN
BUT I AM VERY CERTAIN SAID RACHEL WHO IN THE MIDST OF THIS CROWDED GOSSIPING BALL-ROOM WAS TALKING MUCH MORE FREELY TO STANLEY AND ALSO STRANGE TO SAY IN MORE SISTERLY FASHION THAN SHE WOULD HAVE DONE IN THE LITTLE PARLOUR OF REDMAN'S FARM
WHAT STATE HAD I REALLY BEEN IN WHEN I SAW THAT LONG-CHINNED APPARITION OF THE PALE PORTRAIT
I MUST I SUPPOSE PAY MY RESPECTS
D--D NONSENSE--IT'S ALL THAT HEAVY BUS OF DRIVER'S--I'LL CHANGE THAT
SOMETHING MAY BE MADE OF MARK WYLDER
A BLOODTHIRSTY RASCAL THAT BRACTON MUTTERED THE MAJOR
RADIE NOT COME YET SAID HE ENTERING
SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL SHOCKED AND HER FEELINGS QUITE CHANGED HOWEVER WHEN NEXT MORNING THE POST BROUGHT A LETTER TO CHELFORD FROM MARK WYLDER BEARING THE BOULOGNE POSTMARK
I THINK HER KNOWLEDGE LAY CHIEFLY IN THE MATTERS OF POULTRY AND PUDDINGS AND LATTERLY OF THE NURSERY WHERE ONE TREASURE LAY--THAT GOLDEN-HAIRED LITTLE BOY FOUR YEARS OLD WHOM I HAD SEEN PLAYING AMONG THE ROSES BEFORE THE PARSONAGE DOOR ASLEEP BY THIS TIME--HALF-PAST SEVEN PRECISE AS OLD LADY CHELFORD LOVED TO WRITE ON HER SUMMONS TO DINNER
HE HAD A FEW PLEASANT LINGERING WORDS TO SAY
SHE DOES NOT ENCOURAGE FELLOWS AS THEY DO
AND THE O'ER-CHARGED HEART AND BRAIN WERE RELIEVED
THE CAPTAIN APPEARED QUITE EASY AND CHEERFUL
THE PENMANSHIP WAS I AM AFRAID CLUMSY AND THE SPELLING HERE AND THERE IRREGULAR
AND TO SAY TRUTH THE MATTER TROUBLED HIS MANLY BREAST BUT LITTLE
HE HAS RUINED ME YOU CRUEL WRETCHED CREATURE SAID RACHEL NOW CONVINCED THAT HE HAD COMPROMISED HER AS HE THREATENED
THERE WAS JUST ONE SENTENCE WHICH STARTLED HER ATTENTION
NO IT WAS NOT MR WYLDER
BUT THE FITFUL EVENING BREEZE CAME UP THROUGH REDMAN'S DELL WITH A GENTLE SWEEP OVER THE AUTUMNAL FOLIAGE
YOU MUST COME IN WITH ME AND DRINK TEA AND THEN YOU CAN GO HOME IN THE BROUGHAM SAID DORCAS MORE KINDLY
I WAS LOOKING TOWARDS THE STAIR-HEAD
YOU DESERVE NO LOVE FROM ME--YOU'VE SHOWED ME NONE--_NEVER STANLEY
HIS MOMENTARY DISGUST HAD RESTORED HIM FOR A FEW SECONDS TO HIS NORMAL SELF
OUR GLANCES MET IN THE MIRROR
BUT HE MUST RAISE A SUFFICIENT SUM FOR THE EXPENSE OF GOING INTO TITLE WOULD BE SOMETHING
IN SUCH DARKNESS REDMAN'S DELL WAS A SOLEMN NOT TO SAY AN AWFUL SPOT
THORNS ALSO AND THISTLES SHALL IT BRING FORTH AND GOD PROVIDES THE FLOWERS TOO
YOU PRESERVE YOUR GOOD LOOKS WONDERFULLY
HE WAS NOT INTERESTED BY THE STRUGGLE OF THE GALLANT MAJOR WHO SMILED LIKE A PRIZE-FIGHTER UNDER HIS PUNISHMENT
I THINK YOU WONDERFUL--I THINK YOU A HEROINE--I DO RADIE
BUT ANOTHER--A PALE COURIER--ON THE SIGHTLESS COURSERS OF THE AIR WAS SPEEDING WITH A DIFFERENT MESSAGE TO CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE IN THE SMALL AND SOMBRE DRAWING-ROOM IN REDMAN'S DELL
LARCOM THE BUTLER VISITS THE ATTORNEY
BUT RESPECTING MR MARK WYLDER HE COULD SAY NOWT HE KNEW NOWT LORD CHELFORD WAS CALLED AWAY AT THIS MOMENT BY AN URGENT NOTE
AND THE WYLDER ARMS WITH THEIR LEGEND RESURGAM STANDS IN BOLD RELIEF OVER THE GREAT DOOR OF BRANDON HALL
WHERE HAVE YOU PUT HIM IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S LOBBY MY LORD
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED AT THAT MOMENT A WALK UPON THE QUARTER-DECK WITH A GOOD HEAD-WIND BLOWING AND LIBERTY TO CURSE AND SWEAR A BIT OVER THE BULWARK
I HAD A VERY LATE DINNER--IN FACT A SUPPER--IN THE PARLOUR
AND CAPTAIN LAKE CONTINUED TO WATCH THE DOOR FOR SOME SECONDS AFTER HIS DEPARTURE AS IF HE COULD SEE HIS RETREATING FIGURE THROUGH IT
HE IS ALWAYS JOTTING DOWN LITTLE SUMS IN ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION
WHEN IT WAS OVER HE EXPECTED CLEARER WEATHER AND A CALM
IT REACHED OLD JACKSON THROUGH HIS SISTER WHO WAS MARRIED TO THE BROTHER OF THE MARQUIS OF DULHAMPTON'S SOLICITOR
11_S
DO YOU KNOW HIS CLUB CAPTAIN LAKE THE WANDERERS
HOW LONG--A VERY SHORT TIME I TELL YOU
AND THEN SHE LOOKED UP SUDDENLY WITH AN ODD FIERCE SMILE AND SHE SAID BITTERLY ENOUGH--'AND YET IF I WERE A MAN AND CAPABLE OF LOVING I COULD LOVE NO OTHER WAY
WILL YOU PLEASE MA'AM WRITE A LITTLE NOTE--MY OLD HAND SHAKES SO SHE COULD HARDLY READ MY WRITING--TO MY MISTRESS--MISS RADIE MA'AM
THERE WERE SOLEMN FESTIVITIES AT BRANDON AND FESTIVE SOLEMNITIES AT THE PRINCIPAL COUNTY HOUSES IN RETURN
RACHEL LAKE WAS GLAD TO SEE THE SLENDER AND SLIGHTLY-STOOPED FIGURE OF THE VICAR STANDING THAT MORNING--HIS BRIGHT LITTLE BOY BY THE HAND--IN THE WICKET OF THE TINY FLOWER-GARDEN OF REDMAN'S FARM
HIS LITTLE MAN WAS SO BRIGHT AND MERRY THAT HE SEEMED TO HIM THE VERY SPIRIT OF LIFE
WHERE--HIS COOL CUNNING ONCE MORE ASCENDANT--HE PENNED THOSE FORGERIES CLOSING THEM WITH MARK WYLDER'S SEAL WHICH HE COMPELLED HIS SISTER--QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF ALL BUT THAT THEIR DESPATCH BY POST AT THE PERIODS PENCILLED UPON THEM WAS ESSENTIAL TO HER WRETCHED BROTHER'S ESCAPE
FORGETTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL CANON THROUGH WHICH BREATHES THE GENUINE SPIRIT OF BRITISH LIBERTY HE FELT FOR A MOMENT THAT HE WAS SUCH A KING AS THAT CAT HAD NO BUSINESS TO LOOK AT
BUT I MUST BE PERMITTED TO DECLINE UNDERTAKING TO INTERPRET THAT ORACLE AND SO SAYING STANLEY LAKE GLIDED INTO THE LIBRARY AND SHUT THE DOOR WITH AN ANGRY CLAP
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND
LAKE WAS NATURALLY BY NO MEANS WANTING IN RESOURCE AND A CERTAIN SORT OF COOLNESS WHICH SUPERVENED WHEN THE MOMENTARY DISTRACTION WAS OVER
AND WE'LL BUY THREE MUFFINS ON OUR WAY HOME FOR A FEAST THIS EVENING
CHAPTER XII
THAT'S ALL JUST TO GET HIM OFF THIS UNPLEASANT GROOVE WITH A LITTLE JOLT I SAID BY-THE-BYE WYLDER YOU KNOW THE PICTURES HERE
IT MAKES MEN BITTER
LET HER LIE IT APPEARED VERY ODD BUT SO IT WAS HE APPEARED EAGER UPON THIS POINT AND FAINT AS HE WAS ALMOST SAVAGE
LOOK HOW HIS NOSTRILS GO LIKE A FISH'S GILLS
MY DEAR SIR IT IS REALLY MELANCHOLY AND UP WENT HIS SMALL PINK EYES IN A PURE HORROR AND HIS HANDS WERE LIFTED AT THE SAME TIME
BUT HE'S AS INNOCENT AS A CHILD--AND YOU KNOW THEM DIRECTIONS IN THE WILL IS VERY STRONG
YOU COULD NOT I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD BE HAPPY WITH STANLEY FOR HER HUSBAND
I ASSURE YOU I'LL NEVER FORGET IT
LARKIN WAS ONE OF THOSE OXEN WHO WHEN TREADING OUT CORN DECLINE TO BE MUZZLED
AND PROMISE ME WILLIAM WYLDER THAT YOU WILL THINK NO MORE OF SELLING THAT REVERSION WHICH MAY BE THE SPLENDID PROVISION OF YOUR DEAR LITTLE BOY
BUT WITH ALL THIS HE COULD BE AS SECRET AS THE SEA WITH WHICH HE WAS CONVERSANT AND AS HARD AS A STONEWALL WHEN IT ANSWERED HIS PURPOSE
AND THAT THERE IS NO GREATER SNARE THAN THE STATE OF THE MAN WITH WHOM ALL GOES SMOOTHLY AND WHO MISTAKES HIS CIRCUMSTANCES FOR HIS VIRTUES
HE HAS FRIGHTENED YOU SAID RACHEL
SHE WAS A HOWARD--_THAT WAS THE FACT HE RELIED ON--NO MORTAL COULD GAINSAY IT
AND SO THAT WEARY NIGHT LIMPED TEDIOUSLY AWAY AND MORNING DAWNED AND TIPPED THE DISCOLOURED FOLIAGE OF THE GLEN WITH ITS GLOW AWAKING THE SONGS OF ALL THE BIRDS AND DISPERSING THE WHITE MISTS OF DARKNESS
BUT ARE NOT THERE RESOURCES I DON'T SEE CAPTAIN LAKE WHAT YOU POINT AT I'LL GIVE HIM SOMETHING FOR HIS REVERSION IF HE CHOOSES AND MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE FOR HIS LIFE THE ATTORNEY SOMEHOW DIDN'T SEEM TO TAKE KINDLY TO THIS PROPOSITION
I HAD PONDERED TOO LONG OVER THE LORE OF THIS SATANIC FAMILY AND DRUNK VERY STRONG TEA I SUPPOSE
HE DID NOT CARE FOR ADVICE ON ANY DIFFICULTY DEPENDING ON HIS SPECIAL RELATIONS TO THE VENDORS IN BOTH THESE CASES
AT ALL EVENTS HE OUGHT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN US AND MARK WYLDER
IN THE HALL SHE FELT FOR A MOMENT QUITE OVERPOWERED AND SITTING IN ONE OF THE OLD CHAIRS THAT DID DUTY THERE SHE UTTERED A DEEP GROAN AND LOOKED WITH SUCH A GAZE IN THE FACE OF THE MAID WHO HAD ADMITTED HER THAT SHE THOUGHT THE OLD WOMAN WAS DYING
I'M COME RACHEL EXPRESSLY TO TAKE YOU WITH ME
CHAPTER XLII
ON THE TABLE THERE LAY A LETTER WHICH MARGERY HAD BROUGHT FROM THE POST-OFFICE
LARKIN IS PLOTTING TREASON AGAINST US
ARE NOT YOU BETTER SAID DORCAS LAYING HER HAND ON RACHEL'S AND LOOKING ON HER WITH A MELANCHOLY GAZE
I AM A VERY POOR CLIENT AND INDEED MORE TROUBLE THAN I COULD POSSIBLY BE GAIN TO ANYONE
I REMEMBER WHEN THIS BIT OF LUCK WOULD HAVE MADE ME A DEVILISH HAPPY FELLOW--_TWICE AS HAPPY
RACHEL LAKE DURING THE DISCUSSION HAD REMOVED HER HAND
THIS ROOM STANLEY DEAR YES THIS ROOM WILL ANSWER VERY WELL HE SAID LOOKING ROUND
AND SOMEHOW IN THIS LOW-ROOFED ROOM SO SMALL AND HOMELY SHE LOOKS LIKE A DISPLACED DIVINITY--AN EXILE UNDER JUNO'S JEALOUSY FROM THE CLOUDY SPLENDOURS OF OLYMPUS--DAZZLINGLY MELANCHOLY AND HUMANO MAJOR AMONG THE MEANNESSES AND TRUMPERIES OF EARTH
VANITY OF VANITIES AS MR THACKERAY AND KING SOLOMON CRY OUT IN TURN
JIM DUTTON HAD NOT TURNED UP SINCE AND HIS LETTER WAS ONE OF THOSE MARES NESTS OF WHICH GENTLEMEN IN MR LARKIN'S LINE OF BUSINESS HAVE SO LARGE AN EXPERIENCE
IT CONTAINED ONLY THESE WORDS WEDNESDAY
HE SEATED HIMSELF ON ONE OF THE RUSTIC SEATS AND HIS YELLOW EYES WANDERED RESTLESSLY AND VAGUELY ALONG THE OUTLINE OF THE BEAUTIFUL HILLS
IN A LITTLE TIME YOU WILL PROBABLY BE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THEM BY THE INEVITABLE DISCLOSURES OF TIME WHICH AS THE WISE MAN SAYS DISCOVERS ALL THINGS BUT--BUT WHAT'--STAMMERED THE PALE VICAR ALTOGETHER SHOCKED AND GIDDY
I HAVE HORRIBLE REASONS AS YOU KNOW FOR AVOIDING YOU AND SO I WILL
VERY WELL
AND IT NEEDED A GOOD DEAL OF THAT ARTIFICIAL COMMAND OF COUNTENANCE WHICH HE CULTIVATED TO PREVENT HIS BETRAYING SOMETHING OF THE LATTER WHEN SIR HARRY BRACTON TALKING LOUD AND VOLUBLY AS USUAL SWAGGERED INTO THE SUPPER-ROOM WITH DORCAS BRANDON ON HIS ARM
I'D LIKE TO GO ON SOME MISSION AND MAYBE COME BACK IN A GREAT MANY YEARS--MAYBE DOLLY WHEN WE ARE OLD
I FANCY MR WYLDER IS A RESOLUTE MAN--NONE OF THE WYLDERS WANTED COURAGE CAPTAIN LAKE WAS BY THIS TIME SMILING HIS SLY SLEEPY SMILE UPON HIS FRENCH BOOTS
LAKE WAS SUBJECT TO TRANSIENT PAROXYSMS OF EXASPERATION
IN A HOLE NEAR THE MILL ROAD--IT'S UP IN THE SILVER LION NOW SIR IT MUST BE THE VICAR'S--IT MUST SAID JOS
I CANNOT TELL WHETHER THAT SLENDER SILKEN MACHINATOR CAPTAIN LAKE LOITERED IN THE CHAPEL FOR THE PURPOSE OF TALKING TO OR AVOIDING JOS
HE HAD A COUPE ALL TO HIMSELF
AND RACHEL IN A WHISPER EJACULATED THE AWFUL NAME THAT MUST NOT BE TAKEN IN VAIN
IT IS SUCH A DARLING LITTLE THING
AND I NEED NOT SAY SUCH A MAN IS NOT TO BE HAD FOR NOTHING LAKE NODDED A SEEMING ASSENT WHICH SEEMED TO SAY I HAVE FOUND IT SO NOW MY DEAR CAPTAIN LAKE I JUST MENTION THIS--I PUT IT BEFORE YOU--THAT IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE COUNTY IS NOT TO BE CONTESTED FOR NOTHING--AND YOU'LL WANT A VERY SERIOUS SUM OF MONEY FOR THE PURPOSE AND POSSIBLY A PETITION--AND I CAN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER MAKE UP WITH AN EFFORT ABOUT L15,000_L NOW IT STRIKES ME THAT IT WOULD BE A WISE THING FOR YOU--THE WISEST THING PERHAPS MY DEAR CAPTAIN LAKE YOU EVER DID--TO PLACE ME IN THE SAME BOAT WITH YOURSELF I DON'T EXACTLY SEE I'LL MAKE IT QUITE CLEAR THE ATTORNEY'S TALL FOREHEAD HAD A LITTLE PINK FLUSH OVER IT AT THIS MOMENT AND HE WAS LOOKING DOWN A LITTLE AND POKING THE BASE OF SIR WILLIAM DE BRAUNDON'S MONUMENT WITH THE POINT OF HIS UMBRELLA
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER
HE WAS GLAD THEY HAD A MOMENT TO THEMSELVES
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU STANLEY
AND NOW STANLEY DEAR SAID SHE FOR JUST THEN SHE WAS PAST CARING FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE SERVANTS I HOPE WE UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER--AT LEAST THAT YOU DO ME
I'M AFRAID IT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR YOU TO WALK TO REDMAN'S FARM DEAR RADIE--BUT IT IS HARDLY A MILE I THINK--FOR YOU SEE THE FELLOW MUST NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE
WELL ONE THING WAS PLAIN
HE SAW HIS SISTER LOOK AT HIM AND HE FLUNG THE KEYS ON THE TABLE RATHER SAVAGELY WITH I DARE SAY A CURSE BETWEEN HIS TEETH
YOU PREJUDGE ME WITHOUT PROOF
OR THE AWFUL SENSE OF IMPENDING CONSEQUENCES THAT CLOSED OVER HER LIKE THE SHADOW OF NIGHT THE MOMENT THE EXCITEMENT OF HER PLEADING WAS OVER--'RACHEL ARE YOU MAD?--FLY FLY FLY WAS ALWAYS SOUNDING IN HER EARS
IN ONE OF THESE TENDER PAROXYSMS WHEN IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS DULCINEA THE YOUNG BARONET WAS ALWAYS HOT SHORT AND SAUCY WITH HIS OWN SEX
BUT IT IS ONLY FROM THE GENERAL TENOR OF WHAT PASSED BY A SORT OF GUESS WORK YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT THAT CONCLUSION LARCOM ASSENTED
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WAS THE TESTIMONY OF LORD CHELFORD WHO PUT CAPTAIN LAKE'S DEPOSITION IN EVIDENCE AS ALSO THE TESTIMONY OF LARKIN AND THE EQUALLY PRECISE EVIDENCE OF LARCOM THE BUTLER
THE CRITICAL PROCESS OF COMING OUT IS HERE CONSUMMATED BY THE YOUNG LADIES OF THAT TOWN AND VICINAGE
GRINNING AT YOUR HEELS
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ANYTHING WILLIE DARLING
THEY THINK IT FAIR YOU KNOW TO DUPE OTHER PEOPLE IN SUCH AFFAIRS
SHE WAS NOT EXACTLY LANGUID BUT A GRAVE AND LISTLESS BEAUTY AND A SPLENDID BEAUTY FOR ALL THAT
I'LL DRINK SOME TEA PLEASE IF YOU HAVE GOT ANY AND IT ISN'T TOO MUCH TROUBLE
AND PLEASE HAND HIM THE ENCLOSED NOTICE OPEN AS YOU GET IT
HONEST BUDDLE WAS DELIGHTED
LADY CHELFORD AND DORCAS AND CHELFORD HAD NEARLY ENDED THAT IRREGULAR REPAST WHEN WE ENTERED
GOOD-NIGHT HE SPOKE IN HIS USUAL CLEAR LOW TONES AND HIS QUEER AMBIGUOUS SMILE WAS THERE STILL
PRAY THINK
JUST NOW SAID WYLDER EMITTING FIRST A THIN STREAM OF SMOKE AND WATCHING ITS ASCENT
FIND OUT WHAT FRIGHTENS HIM AND DO IT OR SAY IT
AND IT WAS I THINK THAT SHE DID NOT SMILE
IT LOOKED OMINOUS AND LIKE AN INCIPIENT SLIDING AWAY OF THE BRANDON BUSINESS WELL NO MATTER ALL THINGS WORKED TOGETHER FOR GOOD
BUT THAT I AM SO FAR FROM UNDERSTANDING MYSELF I SHOULD OFTEN BE AMAZED AT THE SAYINGS AND DOINGS OF OTHER PEOPLE
PERFECTLY
HE WAS INWARDLY SENSIBLE OF A SORT OF CONDESCENSION IN ENTERING SO DIMINUTIVE AND HOMELY A PLACE--A KIND OF HALF AMUSING DISPROPORTION BETWEEN JOS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER
I VENTURE TO SAY MOST POSITIVELY I CAN'T CONCEIVE ANY SANE REASON FOR YOUR REFUSING DORCAS'S ENTREATY TO LIVE WITH US AT BRANDON AND LEAVE THIS TRISTE AND UNWHOLESOME AND EVERYWAY OBJECTIONABLE PLACE SHE WAS VERY KIND BUT I CAN'T DO IT YES YOU CAN'T DO IT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE PRECISELY THE MOST SENSIBLE PRUDENT AND COMFORTABLE ARRANGEMENT YOU COULD POSSIBLY MAKE
SHE WAS GOING HIS WAY
WHEN I MET LORD CHELFORD IN HIS EARLY WALK THAT MORNING I'M SURE I LOOKED MYSELF LIKE A GHOST--AT ALL EVENTS VERY WILD AND SEEDY--FOR HE ASKED ME MORE SERIOUSLY THAN USUAL HOW I WAS
AND NOW STANLEY ONE WORD MORE
STATION
YES THIS IS IT--HERE IT IS--THIS IS IT
BURLINGTON AND SMITH TO COMPEL HIM TO EXECUTE A CONVEYANCE TO THEIR CLIENT--ON THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT
AND DOCTOR BUDDLE SAYS IF THE CUT ON HIS JAW HAD BEEN HALF AN INCH LOWER HE WOULD HAVE CUT SOME ARTERY AND LOST HIS LIFE--WRETCHED MAN THEY HAVE COME ABOUT LAW BUSINESS DOLLY ENQUIRED THE YOUNG LADY WHO HAD A PROFOUND INSTINCTIVE DREAD OF MR LARKIN
DID THE SAME IDEA NEVER STRIKE YOU NOT I THINK THAT I CAN RECOLLECT IN NONE OF YOUR CONVERSATIONS UPON THE SUBJECT WITH--WITH MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY CONTINUED THE ATTORNEY WITH A GRAVE SIGNIFICANCE
LAKE WAS LISTENING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER ANYONE WAS STIRRING AND BEING SATISFIED RE-ASCENDED THE STAIRS LEAVING THE STOUT AND COURTEOUS BUTLER AMPLE MATTER FOR ROMANTIC SPECULATION
AND AN EXCITING ONE IT WAS
THE VICAR ON HIS WAY TO THE CHAPEL PASSED MR JOS
AS IT WAS HOWEVER I WAS RESOLVED TO MAINTAIN MY POSITION
BUT TAMAR WAS OUT OF THE WAY
WON'T YOU SEND FOR WILLIAM WYLDER AND CHELFORD AND TELL ALL YOU KNOW OF MARK SHE SAW HE WAS ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING AND SHE LEANED HER HEAD NEAR HIS LIPS AND SHE HEARD HIM WHISPER IT WON'T SERVE MARK I'M THINKING OF YOU STANLEY--I'M THINKING OF YOU TO WHICH HE SAID EITHER YES OR SO SHE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH
DOLLY YOU ARE TOO GOOD TO ME RACHEL'S EYES WERE LOOKING INTO HERS WITH A CAREWORN ENTREATING GAZE AND HER COLD HAND WAS PRESSED ON THE BACK OF DOLLY'S
IN FACT THAT THE LITTLE MAN WITH OF COURSE GREAT CARE MIGHT DO VERY WELL AND OUGHT TO RECOVER IF NOTHING WENT WRONG
AND I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY TO EMPLOY THROUGH HIM SEVERAL PERSONS WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH HIS APPEARANCE AND AT MY DESIRE FREQUENT THOSE PLACES WITH A VIEW TO DISCOVERING HIM AND BRINGING ABOUT AN INTERVIEW WITH ME
YOU MUST NOT BE SO EXCITED DORCAS SAY WHAT THE DOCTOR MAY SEE HIM I MUST THERE IS TIME TO THINK OF THAT DARLING HAS HE SPOKEN TO ANYONE VERY LITTLE I BELIEVE
LARKIN ROSE FROM HIS DESK RUMINATING AND WENT TO THE WINDOW AND PLACED THE LETTER AGAINST THE PANE
BUT THANK GOD IT IS OVER AND THEY CRIED AND SMILED TOGETHER IN THAT DELIGHTFUL EMBRACE WHILE ALL THE TIME LITTLE FAIRY WITH A PAPER CAP ON HIS HEAD WAS TELLING THEM HALF-A-DOZEN THINGS TOGETHER AND PULLING WAPSIE BY THE SKIRTS
I DID NOT THINK OF THAT
LUKE TOOK CARE OF MR LARKIN'S DOGS AND GROOMED MR WYLDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOG-CART FOR MARK BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOG-CART IN THE POST-OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE
WHY OBJECTION MY DEAR SIR IS A STRONG WORD
DON'T BE A MUFF AND GIVE HIM EXPENSIVE WINES--A PINT OF SHERRY IS PLENTY BETWEEN YOU
AND WILL CHOOSE I THINK FOR HIMSELF AND I FANCY NOT ALTOGETHER ACCORDING TO THEIR IDEAS WHEN THE TIME COMES
A HANDSOME FORTUNE
I TOLD YOU HE RESUMED AGAIN AFTER A SHORT PAUSE AND COMMENCING WITH A GENTLE LAUGH THAT SHE LIKED THAT FELLOW BRACTON YOU DID SAY SOMETHING I THINK OF THAT SOME TIME SINCE SAID RACHEL
AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE WHEN STANLEY'S EYE WAS NOT UPON HIM GLANCE SHARPLY ON THE YOUNG MAN WITH AN UNEASY AND NOT VERY FRIENDLY CURIOSITY
I THINK THEY ARE PUZZLED TOO
PAY MARTIN FOR THE JOB WHEN FINISHED
THEY HAVE GOT DOGS AND GUNS AND ARE GOING OF COURSE TO SHOOT
LORD CHELFORD LISTENED SO QUIETLY THAT THE TALL ATTORNEY FELT HE WAS MAKING WAY WITH HIM AND CONCLUDED HIS PERSUASION BY APPEALING TO HIM FOR AN OPINION
THAT'S VERY CONVENIENT
HE HAD SO OPERATED ON MARK WYLDER
HOW D'YE DO LARKIN
IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I SAW YOU CHARLES
BUT HE HAD COOLED BY THE TIME HE REACHED LONDON AND THE LETTER FROM LAKE RECEIVED AT HIS MOTHER'S AND APPOINTING THE MEETING AT BRANDON QUIETED THAT MUTINY
IN THE HALL I MET THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE LOOKING VERY HANDSOME BUT WITH A CERTAIN WITCH-LIKE BEAUTY VERY PALE SOMETHING A LITTLE HAGGARD IN HER GREAT DARK EYES AND A STRANGE LISTENING LOOK
HIS LITTLE MAN--LITTLE FAIRY--OH
LAKE CLEARED HIS THROAT TWICE BUT DID NOT FIND HIS VOICE AND TURNED AWAY AND READ HALF THROUGH THE EPITAPH ON LADY MARY BRANDON WHICH IS A PIOUS AND SOMEWHAT PURITANICAL COMPOSITION
IF YOU HAVE FORMED ANY PLAN WHICH DEPENDS UPON FRIGHTENING HIM IT IS A DESPERATE ONE
HOW YOU FIND THEM RATED AND CLASSIFIED--WHAT ODD NOTES YOU MAKE TO THEM IN THE MARGIN
MY CHAMBER AS I HAVE MENTIONED WAS UPON THE THIRD STOREY
LORD CHELFORD WAS SURPRISED TO SEE RACHEL AND HELD HER HAND WHILE HE CONGRATULATED HER ON THE MORE FAVOURABLE OPINION OF THE PHYSICIAN THIS AFTERNOON
THE ONLY THING TO BE DONE IT STRIKES ME IS TO SELL A PART OF FIVE OAKS I'LL NOT SELL ANY PROPERTY STANLEY AND WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE THEN I DON'T KNOW
BUT I DON'T KNOW VERY WELL WHAT TO MAKE OF HER
HE WAS GRACIOUS TO HIS DOMESTICS BUT THE DISTANCE WAS INCREASED
THEN I HEARD TWO O'CLOCK STRIKE
YOU'D RATHER HAVE YOUR POOR OLD UGLY MUSSIE
IT WOULD SEEM WE HAVE MADE A MISTAKE MRS CRUTCHLEIGH WAS SENSITIVE ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF THE FAMILY OF CLAY MANOR
HE MUMBLED TO HIMSELF IN HIS DROWSY STATE AS SHE WAS QUITE SURE IN PRAYER
AND HE HAD THE VEXATION TO SEE LORD CHELFORD PALPABLY ENGAGING MISS BRANDON FOR THE NEXT DANCE
AND THEN HE LEANED BACK LUXURIOUSLY HIS NEWSPAPER LISTLESSLY ON HIS KNEES AND BEGAN TO READ INSTEAD AT HIS EASE THE SHAPELESS WRAPT-UP FIGURE DIAGONALLY OPPOSITE
THE MORNING--YES THE MORNING--WHAT THEN
STANLEY YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO FEEL AS I DO THE SHAME AND TREACHERY OF MY SITUATION
IN SOWING MY ANNUALS I HAVE SO MUCH TO FORECAST AND ARRANGE
HIS MONEY WAS QUITE SAFE
AND I KNOW IF HE THOUGHT IT ANYTHING THE LEAST SERIOUS DOCTOR BUDDLE WOULD HAVE LOOKED IN BEFORE NOW HE'S SO VERY KIND I WISH MY DARLING COULD GET A LITTLE SLEEP
BUSY TIMES SIR TOM WEALDON USED TO REMARK WITH A CHUCKLE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE THICK OF THE FUSS AND CONSPIRATION WHICH WAS THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS
THE GHOST OF MISS BAILY IS A LIE HE SAID BY MY SOUL
NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THIS HOWEVER OUR DINNER WAS ON THE WHOLE MUCH PLEASANTER THAN I ANTICIPATED
THE FACT IS YOU MUST MY DEAR MR WYLDER MAKE AN EFFORT
I SHOULD BE SO MUCH HAPPIER
SOMEHOW HIS TIMES DID NOT INTEREST HIM AT BREAKFAST
THAT WHEN A DIRE NECESSITY SUBJUGATED HIS WILL HIS CONTEMPT HIS RAGE AND HE INWARDLY DECIDED THAT THE ATTORNEY'S EXTORTION MUST BE SUBMITTED TO HIS WIFE--WHOM HE NEVER MADE ANY ACCOUNT OF IN THE TRANSACTION WHOM HE RECKONED CARELESSLY ON TURNING ABOUT AS HE PLEASED BY A FEW COMPLIMENTS AND CAJOLERIES--SHOULD HAVE STARTED UP COLD AND INFLEXIBLE AS MARBLE IN HIS PATH TO FORBID THE PAYMENT OF THE BLACK MAIL AND EXPOSE HIM TO THE UNASCERTAINED AND FORMIDABLE CONSEQUENCES OF DUTTON'S STORY AND THE DISAPPOINTED ATTORNEY'S VENGEANCE--WAS ANOTHER STROKE OF LUCK WHICH TOOK HIM ALTOGETHER BY SURPRISE
AND NOW MY DEAR AND REVEREND FRIEND YOU KNOW ME I HOPE CONTINUED MR LARKIN VERY KINDLY AS HE HANDED BACK THE LETTER
SOMETHING LIKE CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE AND A POSSIBILITY EVEN OF ENJOYING THE PRESENT WAS STRUGGLING VISIBLY THROUGH THE COLD FOG THAT ENVIRONED HIM
I'D WALK TILL I DROPPED TO REACH YOU--BUT I'D SAY WHAT'S ON MY MIND TIS LIKE A MESSAGE FROM HEAVEN--AND I MUST SPEAK--AYE DEAR I MUST BUT I SAY I CAN'T STAY
THIS EVENING IN THE DRAWING-ROOM THERE WERE TWO VERY PRETTY ORMOLU CASKETS UPON THE LITTLE MARBLE TABLE
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF HIM
AND WHO THOUGH SELDOM SOBER WAS ALWAYS WELL INSTRUCTED IN THE NEWS OF THE TOWN
CHAPTER II
HAPPY THE GIRL--AND I AM ONE--WHO CANNOT LIKE UNTIL SHE IS FIRST BELOVED
DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLAN TO STICK UP A DEATH'S-HEAD AND CROSS-BONES HERE AND THERE AND TO SPLIT UP OLD COFFIN-LIDS FOR YOUR SETTING-STICKS AND GET OLD MOWLDERS THE SEXTON TO BURY YOUR ROOTS AND COVER THEM IN WITH A DUST TO DUST AND SO FORTH AND PLANT A YEW TREE IN THE MIDDLE AND STICK THOSE BITS OF PAINTED BOARD THAT LOOK SO WOEFULLY LIKE GRAVESTONES ALL ROUND IT AND THEN LET OLD TAMAR PROWL ABOUT FOR A GHOST
I STILL BELIEVE IN THE INFLUENCE--FROM THE TIPS OF YOUR FINGERS YOUR LOOKS AND TONES
YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE COMMITTED YOURSELF THAN HE
MARK WYLDER HAD RETURNED FROM BOULOGNE FOR THE POWER OF ATTORNEY HAD BEEN EXECUTED AT BRIGHTON
OF COURSE NON CUIVIS CONTIGIT IT WAS NOT EVERY MAN'S PRIVILEGE TO DANCE WITH THE SPLENDID LADY OF BRANDON
PEOPLE SAID ALSO WHAT IS TRUE OF MOST TERRORISTS THAT HE WAS HIMSELF QUITE CAPABLE OF BEING FRIGHTENED
A MAN OF FASHION--A TOWN MAN--HIS DRESS BESPOKE HIM
IT WAS ONLY AN HOUR SINCE IN CONVERSATION WITH OUR POLICEMAN EDWARDS THAT I MENTIONED THE FACT OF MY HAVING MYSELF TRAVELLED FROM LONDON TO SHILLINGSWORTH LAST NIGHT WITH MR MARK WYLDER WHO WENT ON BY TRAIN IN THIS DIRECTION I PRESUME TO MEET OUR UNFORTUNATE FRIEND CAPTAIN LAKE BY APPOINTMENT
CHAPTER VI
WHEN LAKE HAD ENDED HIS TOILET AND STARED IN THE GLASS HE STILL LOOKED SO HAGGARD THAT ON GREETING MR LARKIN IN THE PARLOUR HE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO MENTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN COLD IN THAT CONFOUNDED BILLIARD-ROOM LAST NIGHT WHICH SPOILED HIS SLEEP AND MADE HIM AWFULLY SEEDY THAT MORNING
IT IS AN ODD FANCY LIVING ALONE HERE AN ODD NECESSITY STANLEY AREN'T YOU AFRAID OF BEING ROBBED AND MURDERED RADIE HE SAID LEANING FORWARD TO SMELL AT THE PRETTY BOUQUET IN THE LITTLE GLASS AND TURNING IT LISTLESSLY ROUND
THIS DIVESTED THE INEVITABLE DISSOLUTION OF THESE HIGH RELATIONS OF A GREAT DEAL OF ITS ECLAT AND RIDICULE
THE BATTLE IS OVER
BUT UNLESS I'M SHARP I CAN'T ESCAPE WHAT'S COMING
WAS IT WATCHFULNESS
WHEN I TELL YOU I CAN'T THAT'S ENOUGH TAMAR DID NOT MOVE HER FINGERS FROM THE SLEEVE OF HIS COAT ON WHICH THEY RESTED AND THAT THIN PRESSURE MYSTERIOUSLY DETAINED HIM
AND WHAT DO YOU FOUND YOUR OPINION ABOUT MR MARK WYLDER ON WELL SIR I COULD NOT HEAR MORE THAN A WORD NOW AND A SENTINCE AGAIN
WHO SHOULD I FIND IN THE DRAWING-ROOM TALKING FLUENTLY AND SMILING AFTER HIS WONT TO OLD LADY CHELFORD WHO SEEMED TO RECEIVE HIM VERY GRACIOUSLY FOR HER AT LEAST BUT CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE
I DO NOT KNOW
IN THE MEANTIME MISS LAKE WITH HER HAND ON HER BROTHER'S ARM WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UNDER THE TREES OF THE BACK AVENUE TOWARDS THAT FOOTPATH WHICH THROUGH WILD COPSE AND BROKEN CLUMPS NEAR THE PARK EMERGES UPON THE STILL DARKER ROAD WHICH PASSES ALONG THE WOODED GLEN BY THE MILLS AND SKIRTS THE LITTLE PALING OF THE RECLUSE LADY'S GARDEN
AND DOCTOR BUDDLE--I MET HIM THIS MORNING--SO KINDLY TOOK HIM INTO HIS ROOM AND EXAMINED HIM AND SAYS IT MAY BE NOTHING AT ALL PLEASE HEAVEN AND SHE SIGHED SMILING STILL
BUT IN THE INTERVALS HIS SHREWD EYES SEARCHED THE FACE OF THE CAPTAIN NOT KNOWING WHETHER TO BELIEVE ONE SYLLABLE OF WHAT HE RELATED
SUCH WICKEDNESS AS THAT CANNOT BE LAWFUL--I WON'T BELIEVE THE LAW ALLOWS IT CRIED RACHEL LAKE
I'VE NO OBJECTION--HAVE I?--TO WRITE SUCH A LETTER ASKED THE VICAR OF HIS ADVISER
YOU PLAINLY KNOW SOMETHING TO MARK WYLDER'S DISCREDIT
I WILL MENTION HOWEVER THAT YOUR INTERFERENCE YOUR VIOLENT INTERFERENCE MADAM MAY BE ATTENDED WITH MOST SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES TO MY REVEREND CLIENT FOR WHICH OF COURSE YOU CONSTITUTED YOURSELF FULLY RESPONSIBLE WHEN YOU ENTERED ON THE COURSE OF UNAUTHORISED INTERFERENCE WHICH HAS RESULTED IN DESTROYING THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT PREPARED WITH GREAT CARE AND LABOUR FOR HIS PROTECTION
BUT I'M SURE IT'S AN INFLUENCE--YOU SMILE AND WHISPER TO THEM SHE SMILED--WITHOUT RAISING HER EYES--ON THE FLOWER SHE WAS TYING UP
AND HE HAS HIS CANARY IN THE CAGE IN THE WINDOW AND HIS KITTEN TO PLAY WITH IN THE STUDY
BUT THIS IS I AM AWARE OPEN TO OBJECTION AND IN FACT WOULD NOT BE JUSTIFIABLE EXCEPT UNDER THE VERY PECULIAR URGENCY OF THE CASE
MR WYLDER'S BUSINESS DETAINS HIM A DAY OR TWO LONGER THAN HE EXPECTED AND HE IS PUNISHED BY A FINAL DISMISSAL THE OLD LADY'S THIN CHEEKS WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES SHOT A REDDISH LIGHT AND ALTOGETHER SHE MADE AN ANGRY SIGHT
WHAT PARTICULAR GOOD CAN IT DO US IN THIS UNPLEASANT UNCERTAINTY WELL DORKIE BELIEVE ME I HAVE A SURE INSTINCT IN MATTERS OF THIS KIND
RACHEL GREW MORE SAD AND STRANGE THAN EVER AFTER THIS MARRIAGE
I'M VERY FOND OF CHILDREN MYSELF AND SHOULD OF COURSE PUT THE ENTIRE CASE--AS RESPECTED HIM AS WELL AS YOURSELF--TO THE BEST OF MY HUMBLE POWERS BEFORE YOU
I PAUSED I WAS DOUBTFUL ABOUT ACCEPTING IT FOR THE BUSINESS OF THE SEASON WAS JUST ABOUT TO COMMENCE IN EARNEST AND THE COUNTRY HAD NOT YET ASSUMED ITS CHARMS
NOW MISS LAKE YOU SEE THIS BOOK
AND RACHEL WITH A START AWOKE AND SAT UP WITH A WILD LOOK AND A CRY WHAT IS IT NOTHING DEAR MISS RADIE--ONLY POOR OLD TAMAR AND A NEW DAY HAD BEGUN
IN HER EAR IT SOUNDED LIKE A WHISPER OR A SHUDDER AND SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES AND SAW THE DARKENING DELL BEFORE HER
NO MORE ROULADES AND RINGING CHORDS FROM THE PIANO--NO MORE CLEAR SPIRITED TONES OF THE LADY'S VOICE SOUNDED THROUGH THE LOW CEILINGS OF REDMAN'S FARM AND THRILLED WITH A HAUNTING MELODY THE DESERTED GLEN WHEREIN THE BIRDS HAD ENDED THEIR VESPER SONGS AND GONE TO REST
BUT IT WAS MOMENTOUS IN THE CRITICAL STATE OF THINGS TO GIVE THIS DANGEROUS ATTORNEY A HANDSOME SHARE IN HIS STAKE--TO PLACE HIM AS HE HAD HIMSELF SAID IN THE SAME BOAT AND ENLIST ALL HIS UNSCRUPULOUS ASTUTENESS IN MAINTAINING HIS TITLE
THE YELLOW EYES AND OPEN MOUTH
AND IN SOME MEASURE YOU TOO RADIE
MR LARKIN'S NEXT STEP WAS TO APPLY FOR A COMMISSIONER TO COME DOWN AND INVESTIGATE
YOU MUST REALLY PLACE YOURSELF MORE CHEERFULLY AND I'LL SPEAK TO CHELFORD ABOUT TAMAR
I DON'T CARE I HOPE HOW POOR A MAN MAY BE BUT DO LET HIM BE A GENTLEMAN
BUT AS HIS RETURN IS DELAYED I MEAN TO PLACE THEM IN CHELFORD'S HANDS
HIS EXPENSES I SAY REACHED EXACTLY L5 3_S
HE DID NOT LIKE GOING FORWARD--BUT TO TURN BACK MIGHT BRING HIM AGAIN BESIDE THE MYSTERIOUS FIGURE
AND EVERY TIME HE WALKED DOWN THE STREET WITH HIS FACE TOWARD LONDON HIS YELLOW EYES GLEAMED THROUGH THE DARK AIR WITH THE FIXED GAZE OF A MAN LOOKING OUT FOR THE APPEARANCE OF A VEHICLE
DORCAS DARLING DON'T FORSAKE ME
RACHEL--A CHANGED RACHEL STILL--THOUGH MORE LIKE HER EARLY SELF WAS NOW IN THE TINY GARDEN OF REDMAN'S FARM
AND IF IT BE SO AS I SAY WHAT'S TO BE DONE NEXT--WHAT'S TO BE DONE--OH WHAT IS TO BE DONE I SAY GOOD-NIGHT OLD TAMAR
OF COURSE AN ATTORNEY'S OPINION UPON A QUESTION OF REAL PROPERTY IS NOT CONCLUSIVE
AND THE YOUNG LADY LOOKED ROUND WITH A STRANGE ANXIETY LIKE A PERSON SEEKING FOR SOMETHING AND FORGETTING WHAT
AND LORD CHELFORD FOLLOWED HER WITH A SAD SORT OF SMILE ADMIRING HER GREATLY
WE HEAR NO COMPLAINTS HOWEVER AND FANCY HE MUST BE TOLERABLY COMFORTABLE NOTWITHSTANDING YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS SAID UNCLE LORNE
I HOPE SHE IS HAPPY
HE GOT THE BODY EASILY DOWN THE NEARLY PRECIPITOUS DECLIVITY
WHAT CAN THAT MEAN MUTTERED LARKIN WITH A SORT OF GASP AT HIS DISCOVERY
WHY SHOULD HE BE RETAINED IN THAT GHASTLY EXISTENCE
AFTER A WHILE IN A PET HE WALKED AWAY
THE ESTATES HAVE BEEN BACK AND FORWARD SO OFTEN BETWEEN THE BRANDONS AND WYLDERS I ALWAYS FANCY THERE MAY BE A SCREW LOOSE OR A FRANGIBLE LINK SOMEWHERE AND HE'S DEEPLY INTERESTED FOR MARK WYLDER YOU ARE BETTER DARLING
I WAS NOT ABLE TO GO UP TO THE HALL MA'AM WITH THE MESSAGE
HE LIKED WRITING PRIVATE OR CONFIDENTIAL AT TOP OF HIS NOTES WITHOUT APPARENT RIGHT OR EVEN REASON TO IMPOSE EITHER PRIVACY OR CONFIDENCE UPON THE PERSONS TO WHOM HE WROTE
I FOUND MYSELF LAST NIGHT SITTING UP IN MY BED TALKING IN THE DARK ABOUT IT THERE WAS A SILENCE FOR A TIME AND RACHEL SAID IT IS GROWING LATE DORCAS BUT YOU MUST NOT GO RACHEL--YOU MUST STAY AND KEEP ME COMPANY--YOU MUST INDEED RADIE SAID DORCAS
HE'LL BE QUITE COOL AGAIN IN FIVE MINUTES
AND WITH A PANG THE DREADFUL SENSE OF REALITY RETURNED
AND I ADMIRE MOORE FOR THAT FLASH OF THE FALLEN ANGELIC--IT IS THE SENTIMENT OF A HERO AND A MADMAN--TOO BASE AND TOO NOBLE FOR THIS COOL WISE WORLD SHE WAS ALREADY MOVING AWAY NEBULOUS IN HOVERING FOLDS OF SNOWY MUSLIN
NOTHING UNUSUAL IS THERE ANSWERED RACHEL GLANCING UNEASILY ROUND LEST THEY SHOULD BE OVERHEARD
I JUMPED OUT OF BED WITH A ROAR AND CHALLENGED THE OWNER OF THE HAND BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER AND HEARD NO SOUND
THEREFORE WITH DECISION AND CAUTION HE FOLLOWED CAPTAIN LAKE'S MARCH AND REACHING THE YEW-WALK HE SAW THE SLIM FIGURE IN THE CAP AND PALETOT TURN THE CORNER AND ENTER THE BROAD WALK BETWEEN THE TWO WALL-LIKE BEECH HEDGES WHICH LED DIRECT TO THE FIRST ARTIFICIAL POND--A LONG NARROW PARALLELOGRAM ROUND WHICH THE BROAD WALK PASSED IN TWO STRAIGHT LINES FENCED WITH THE TOWERING BEECH HEDGES SHORN AS SMOOTH AS THE WALLS OF A NUNNERY
YOU'LL SAY SO WHEN YOU HAVE QUITE HEARD ME
MR WYLDER IS ABOUT TO REAPPEAR AND HAS DESPATCHED THESE HERALDS OF HIS APPROACH NO DOUBT SUITABLY FREIGHTED TO PLEAD FOR HIS REACCEPTANCE INTO FAVOUR
THEN A BOLD RENUNCIATION AND EXPOSURE OF MR JOS
WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF THE HUMAN PORTION OF THE HOSTILE PAGEANT TOM BEING AN OFFICIAL PERSON DID NOT CHOOSE TO HINT
HE WAS VERY GENTLEMANLIKE IN APPEARANCE AND EVEN ELEGANT
THESE TERRORS AND DUBITATIONS ARE INFECTIOUS
LARKIN ON THE GREEN--NOT NEAR ENOUGH TO SPEAK--ONLY TO SMILE AND WAVE HIS HAND KINDLY AND LOOK AFTER THE GOOD ATTORNEY WITH ONE OF THOSE YEARNING GRATEFUL LOOKS WHICH CLING TO STRAWS UPON THE DROWNING STREAM OF LIFE
THE STORY WHICH IN HIS LAST INTERVIEW WITH LORD CHELFORD STANLEY LAKE HAD RELATED WAS PROBABLY AS NEAR THE TRUTH AS HE WAS CAPABLE OF TELLING
WHO CAN THIS BE SAID LAKE LOOKING AT THE ADDRESS OF ONE OF THESE
WAS IT POSSIBLE TO HOLD TO BOTH OR MUST HE CLEAVE ONLY TO ONE AND DESPISE THE OTHER
BUT IF YOU COULD SEND UP SOME WATER I THINK HE'D LIKE IT
BUT THEY ARE TALKING OF FOUR DIFFERENT MEN ALREADY TO TAKE SIR HARRY TWISDEN'S PLACE
DEATH WILL CLOSE THE EYES AND EARS AGAINST THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF EARTH
SO THERE WERE WYLDERS OF BRANDON AND BRANDONS OF BRANDON
AT HIS SUGGESTION I HAVE SENT FOR SIR FRANCIS SEDDLEY FROM TOWN AND I HOPE HE MAY ARRIVE EARLY TO-MORROW MORNING WHY STANLEY LAKE MAY DIE TO-DAY HE DOES NOT APPREHEND THAT
BUT THE FIGURE BEGAN TO MOVE AND I RAISED MY EYES AND SAW IT RETREAT WITH A LIMPING GAIT INTO THE THICK COPSE BEFORE ME IN THE SHADOW OF WHICH IT STOPPED AND TURNED STIFFLY ROUND AND DIRECTED ON ME A LOOK OF HORROR AND THEN WITHDREW
SIR YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT JAMES DUTTON THIS EPISTLE DISTURBED MR JOS
THE MOON HAD GONE DOWN AND THE GLEN WAS DARKER THAN EVER
I HAD FORGOT AT THE MOMENT THAT THE ILL-OMENED PORTRAIT HUNG THERE AND A SUDDEN HORROR SMOTE ME
IS NOT IT SO IT IS REALLY
D THAT SHEER COLD BLADE
AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOUR FRIENDSHIP--YOU'LL BE MY FRIEND STILL--WON'T YOU
WHY WON'T YOU CREDIT WHAT I SAY I DON'T URGE YOU--I NEVER HAVE--TO REVEAL THAT WHICH YOU DESCRIBE SO STRANGELY AS A CONCEALMENT YET NO SECRET
I NEVER KNEW BEFORE THAT HE HAD ANY EXCLAIMED DORCAS
IN THE NATURE OF THINGS IT CAN HARDLY BE OTHERWISE I REPLIED A GOOD DEAL STARTLED AND PERPLEXED BY THE CURIOUS AUDACITY OF HER INTERROGATORY
AND I WOULD NOW WRITE BUT THERE IS NO ADDRESS TO HIS LETTERS
AND LET HIM KNOW THE MOMENT THEY MEET
JUST AT THIS MOMENT THEY BECAME AWARE OF A TIMID LITTLE TAPPING WHICH HAD BEEN GOING ON AT THE WINDOW DURING THE LATTER PART OF THIS CONFERENCE AND LOOKING UP THE ATTORNEY AND THE VICAR SAW LITTLE FAIRY'S VIOLET EYES PEERING UNDER HIS LIGHT HAIR WITH ITS MILD GOLDEN SHADOW AND THE ODD SENSITIVE SMILE AT ONCE SHY AND ARCH
DORCAS WAS NOT VERY WELL
BUT TIME CANNOT CHANGE ME--AND I AM SPEAKING NOT FROM IMPULSE BUT CONVICTION
I DON'T AFFECT TO BE ANGRY OR TALK ROMANCE AND HEROICS BECAUSE YOU FANCY SUCH STUFF
THERE WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN THE QUALITY OF THE INK THAT WROTE THE NUMBER OF THE DATE 28TH FROM THAT USED IN THE REST OF THE LETTER
SO I STOPPED A LITTLE WAY IN THE COPSEWOOD WHICH WAS GROWING QUITE DARK AND I SHOUTED THERE AGAIN PEEPING UNDER THE BRANCHES AND FELT QUEER AND MUCH RELIEVED THAT NOTHING ANSWERED OR APPEARED
BUT NEEDING A MODICUM OF LATHER THE LOOKING GLASS THE STROP THE DILIGENT RAZOR DELICATE MANIPULATION AND STEALING A PORTION OF OUR PRECIOUS TIME EVERY DAY WE LIVE
NO PERSON LIVING HAS A RIGHT TO DEMAND ONE VERY TRAGIC YOUNG LADY AND QUITE CHARMING SNEERED THE DOWAGER ANGRILY
I'M THREATENING NOTHING BUT THE WRATH OF GOD WHO HEARS US UNLESS YOU MEAN TO DO ME AN INJURY TAMAR I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU MEAN HE ANSWERED IN A CHANGED TONE
LARKIN LOOKED UP SMILING WITH HIS MOUTH ALSO A LITTLE OPEN AS WAS HIS WONT WHEN HE WAS PARTICULARLY AFFABLE
I AM AFRAID I AM A VERY IMPERTINENT--AT LEAST A VERY INQUISITIVE--WAYFARER
BUT HE WOULD SOON BE UP AND OUT AGAIN AND HE WOULD STEAL UP NOW AND SEE HIM
BUT RACHEL THOUGH SHE TREATED THE SUBJECT SERENELY IN THIS INTERVIEW WAS SADDER AND MORE FORLORN THAN EVER AND LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT AND PERHAPS IF WE KNEW ALL SHED SOME SECRET TEARS
THAT MORNING LAKE'S FIRST REPORT UPON HIS INQUISITION INTO THE WHEREABOUTS OF MARK WYLDER--ALTOGETHER DISAPPOINTING AND BARREN--REACHED LORD CHELFORD IN A SHORT LETTER
MAYBE RACHEL DEAR YOU WOULD LIKE TO DRIVE A LITTLE NO DARLING NOT YET
TAMAR HAD PASSED THE AGE OF GHOSTLY TERRORS
AND THESE YARNS FURNISHED AFTER THE PATTERN OF OTHELLO'S TALES OF ANTHROPOPHAGITES AND MEN WHOSE HEADS DO GROW BENEATH THEIR SHOULDERS ONE OF THE MANY VARIETIES OF FASCINATION WHICH HE PRACTISED ON THE FAIR SEX
WHY YOU HAVE THIS MOMENT HAD A LETTER FROM HOCKLEY
RACHEL SAW THAT SHE HAD MADE AN IMPRESSION UPON DOLLY AND WAS RESOLVED TO CARRY HER POINT
BURLINGTON AND SMITH'S CLIENTS
THIS ON THE BEST AUTHORITY
WILLIAM WAS ALWAYS A VERY CLEVER FELLOW TO TALK--VERY WELL READ IN THEOLOGY--IS NOT HE?--YES HE DOES TALK VERY SWEETLY AND NOBLY ON RELIGION
HAD HE CROSSED HIM YESTERDAY BY THE DOWN-TRAIN AND WAS HE BY THIS TIME CLOSETED WITH LARKIN IN THE LODGE
I THOUGHT HE HAD RETURNED TO BRIGHTON
SO LISTEN TO ME THIS IS A VITAL MATTER
LISTEN TO ME YOU COWARDLY LIBELLER
HARDLY SO MUCH BUT NEARLY PERHAPS FORTY-THREE THOUSAND POUNDS WERE OFFERED FOR IT
YOU BLAME YOUR BROTHER RACHEL IN THIS AFFAIR DID I
AND ONE AFTER ANOTHER WRECKS THE DAUGHTERS OF OUR FAMILY--A WAYWARD FAMILY AND FULL OF MISERY
IT IS VERY HARD TO ESCAPE THAT SUBTLE AND INTOXICATING POISON
DON'T MOVE TILL I GO DOWN
WHY--WHY--THIS--_POSITIVELY THIS IS THE LETTER
AND AS SHE TURNED WITH A START SHE SAW OLD TAMAR STANDING IN THE DOOR-WAY LOOKING AT HER
HE NEITHER IS NOR EVER WILL BE MARRIED
IT CAN'T BE FOR MONEY OR BALLS OR PLAY AND HE HAS NO HONEST BUSINESS ANYWHERE
YOU KNOW ME--YOU KNOW HOW I HATE SECRETS
AND ALTOGETHER I AM AFRAID OUR FRIEND THE VICAR WAS BEING EXTRICATED IN A RATHER EMBARRASSING FASHION
POOR RACHEL LAKE MADE OLD TAMAR SIT AT HER WORSTEDS IN THE WINDOW OF THE LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM WHILE THESE CONVERSATIONS PROCEEDED
HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO BELIEVE THIS LETTER OR NOT
HE AND I HAD JUST HAD A GAME AND WERE TIRED OF IT
I KNOW HE'S A BAD MAN A WORTHLESS MAN--SELFISH CRUEL MAYBE
HE MADE A STATEMENT TO CHELFORD WHO WAS A MAGISTRATE FOR THE COUNTY I SUPPOSE TO ASSIST THE CORONER'S INQUEST
I THINK SHE SAID YOU MENTIONED YESTERDAY THAT YOU REMEMBERED ME WHEN AN INFANT
LADY CHELFORD WITH ONE OF THOSE SUDDEN CHANGES OF FRONT WHICH OCCUR IN FEMALE STRATEGY ON HEARING THAT STANLEY LAKE WAS ACTUALLY ACCEPTED BY DORCAS HAD ASSAILED BOTH HIM AND HIS SISTER WHOM HERETOFORE SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL PETTED AND DISTINGUISHED WITH A FURY THAT WAS STARTLING
I SEE THE RING OF THE PERSIAN MAGICIAN
THERE WERE A GOOD MANY DRUNKEN FELLOWS ABOUT THE TOWN BUT THERE WAS AN END OF ELECTION DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE BRANDON INTEREST
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS YOUR BOUDOIR OR PARLOUR I CALL IT MY DRAWING-ROOM BUT IT'S ANYTHING YOU PLEASE WHAT VERY ODD PEOPLE OUR ANCESTORS WERE HE MUSED ON
THE TALL FORM OF UNCLE LORNE WAS LEANING AGAINST A TREE AT THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE WITH HIS LEFT HAND EXTENDED TOWARDS US AND HIS RIGHT POINTING DOWN THE PRECIPICE
SO AFTER A WHILE DOLLY ASSISTING AND SOMETIMES BOTH TALKING TOGETHER THE STORY WAS TOLD RACHEL BLESSED AND PANEGYRISED AND THE ATTORNEY'S CONGRATULATIONS CHALLENGED AND YIELDED ONCE MORE
I HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT A VERY DANGEROUS PERSON HAS DISCOVERED MORE ABOUT THAT DREADFUL EVENING THAN WE BELIEVED KNOWN TO ANYBODY IN GYLINGDEN
I SHALL GO TO DOLINGTON DAY ARTER TO-MORROW BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK TRANE IF YOU ERE GONG SIR WHEN THE ATTORNEY RETURNED BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE O'CLOCK NEXT MORNING THIS LETTER AWAITED HIM
EASILY EARNED LUKE SAID CAPTAIN LAKE IN HIS SOFT TONES
AND AFTER ALL YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD THERE--ANY MAN MAY HAVE BUSINESS
ALL OVER!--NEVER TO STIR MORE
THE SUDDEN AND TOTAL DISAPPEARANCE OF SO COLOSSAL AN OBJECT WAS ITSELF AMAZING
AND THE LAWYER FELLOWS AND TRUSTEES AND ALL THAT SORT OF PRUDENT PEOPLE GET ABOUT ONE AND PERSUADE AND EXHORT AND THEY BULLY YOU BY JOVE
THERE HE HAD SPOKEN THE SENTENCES WHICH MADE THE EARTH TREMBLE AND SHOWED HER DISTINCTLY THE CRACKING LINE BENEATH HER FEET WHICH WOULD GAPE AT HIS WORD INTO THE FATHOMLESS CHASM THAT WAS TO SWALLOW HER
IT SAID MY DEAR SIR,--I THINK I HAVE REASON TO COMPLAIN
AH NO
BUT HE WON'T STAY IN THE COUNTRY NOR SPEND HIS MONEY TO PLEASE YOU OR I
THE CAPTAIN WAS A TERRORIST
ORDER THEM IN HIS NAME BUT BRING THEM DOWN WITH YOU SO I WAS A SECOND TIME GOING DOWN TO BRANDON AS HONORARY COUNSEL WITHOUT KNOWING IT
YOU ARE ONE OF US RACHEL
MR LARCOM HELD HIS BREATH
BURLINGTON AND SMITH WHO HE MUST ADMIT HAD GONE TO VERY GREAT EXPENSE IN INVESTIGATING TITLE PREPARING DEEDS C AND WHO WERE NOTED AS A VERY EXPENSIVE HOUSE
NO THAT'S IN THE LAKE OF FIRE WHERE THE WICKED SERAPHIM AND CHERUBIM BAPTISE AND ANABAPTISE AND HOLD THEM UNDER WITH A GREAT STONE LAID ACROSS THEIR BREASTS
BUT NOT EVERY KIND OF FLOWERS WILL GROW THERE UNDER THE LORDLY SHADOW OF THE ELMS AND CHESTNUTS
AND TO CROWN ALL MISS RADIE HAD GROWN TIRED OF KEEPING HER OWN SECRET AND MUST NEEDS BRING TO LIGHT THE BURIED DISGRACES WHICH ALL CONCERNED WERE EQUALLY INTERESTED IN HIDING AWAY FOR EVER
IT MIGHT BE THE MAKING OF HIM
HE STOPPED SHORT--AND AS HE STARED UPON THE OBJECT HE FELT THAT ELECTRIC CHILL AND RISING OF THE HAIR WHICH ACCOMPANY SUPERNATURAL PANIC
WON'T YOU TRUST ME AND NOW FOR MY ADVICE SAID DORCAS SMILING DOWN IN HER MYSTERIOUS WAY UPON A CRIMSON EXOTIC NEAR HER FEET
I ASSURE YOU I ALTOGETHER ACQUIT YOU OF SYMPATHY WITH ANY THING SO UTTERLY RUFFIANLY AND HE TOOK THE HAND OF THE RELIEVED ATTORNEY WITH A FRIENDLY CONDESCENSION
YOU SAW IT TOO FOR NOTHING OF THAT KIND ESCAPES YOU
BUT THERE MAY BE SOME ONE
AND CHELFORD IS A VERY GOOD FELLOW OF COURSE AND ALL THAT--BUT HE'S TAKING CARE OF DORCAS YOU SEE
TO TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH I WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT AFRAID
AND I HAVE BEEN TWO OFTEN DUPED BY HIM TO TRUST WHAT HE SAYS
I AM QUITE CONFIRMED IN THE VIEW I TOOK AT FIRST HE SAID
BUT HE'LL BE SENT UP AGAIN AT LAST A THOUSAND A HUNDRED TEN AND ONE BLACK MARBLE STEPS AND THEN IT WILL BE THE OTHER ONE'S TURN
IT WAS A TREMENDOUS CRISIS FOR HONEST MRS PAGE THE CONFECTIONER OVER THE WAY WHO IN LEGAL PHRASE HAD THE CARRIAGE OF THE SUPPER AND REFRESHMENTS THOUGH LARGELY ASSISTED BY MR BATTERSBY OF DOLLINGTON
FOR LORD GEORGE IS TOO STRONG TO BE SHOOK OUT
THE DOOR OF THE LITTLE CHAMBER OPENED AND STANLEY LAKE ENTERED SAYING IN A DOUBTFUL ALMOST TIMID WAY IT IS I RADIE COME TO THANK YOU AND JUST TO ASK YOU HOW YOU DO AND TO SAY I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR KINDNESS
THERE ARE OTHERS ON WHOM MUCH MORE NATURALLY THE CARE OF HIS MONEY WOULD DEVOLVE AND I THINK THAT MY UNDERTAKING THE OFFICE HE PROPOSES UNDER HIS PRESENT STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT APPEAR LIKE AN ACQUIESCENCE IN THE EXTRAORDINARY COURSE HE HAS TAKEN AND A SANCTION GENERALLY OF HIS CONDUCT WHICH I CERTAINLY CAN'T APPROVE
IT'S VERY STRONG--CAPITAL I SAID CRUNCHING MY TOAST
HE MERELY SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH THE SLIGHTEST IMAGINABLE NOD AND A WAVE OF A PUDGY HAND IN A SOILED DOG-SKIN GLOVE WHICH EMERGED FOR A SECOND FROM UNDER A CAPE IN TOKEN THAT HE GRATEFULLY DECLINED THE FAVOUR
AND THEN THE CAPTAIN DREW A LONG BREATH AND THEN STILL STARING AT HIM HE LAUGHED A GHASTLY LITTLE LAUGH ALSO QUIETLY
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM
IT IS FIRST TO BLOOM--FIRST TO WITHER
AS WELL MIGHT THE GENTLEMAN WHO SHAVES SUPPOSE AS HIS FINGERS GLIDE AFTER THE OPERATION OVER THE POLISHED SURFACE OF HIS CHIN--_FACTUS AD UNGUEM_--THAT HE MAY FLING HIS BRUSH AND STROP INTO THE FIRE AND BURY HIS RAZOR CERTAIN FATHOMS IN THE EARTH
IT IS A HEAVY ITEM ANY WAY
BUT NO--I HAVE NO FAITH IN THE SCISSORS
YET THE LETTER FROM GENOA DATED 20TH REFERS BACK TO THE LETTER FROM VENICE WRITTEN EIGHT DAYS LATER
I RESOLVED RACHEL QUITE TO EXTINGUISH THE MADNESS
SHE WAS SANGUINE SHE WAS GENIAL AND COMPANIONABLE AND HER SPIRITS ROSE AT THE SIGHT OF A FRIENDLY FACE
LARKIN A LAWYER OF GYLINGDEN
HE HAD A MERCANTILE GENIUS AND NEVER EXERCISED HIS CRAFT VIOLENCE AND FEROCITY ON MEN OR OBJECTS WHEN NO ADVANTAGE WAS OBTAINABLE BY SO DOING
AND WHEN IN FITFUL REVERIES FANCY TURNED FOR A MOMENT TO AN EARTHLY PAST AND FUTURE ALL THERE WAS A BLANK--THE PAST SADDENED THE FUTURE BLEAK
LET US SUPPOSE IT WAS ONE OF THOSE FALTERINGS OF FAITH WHICH TRY THE BEST MEN THAT JUST NOW MADE HIM FEEL A LITTLE QUEER AND GAVE HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT MARK WYLDER NOW GROWN HABITUAL THAT NEW AND GHASTLY COMPLEXION WHICH MADE THE SITUATION SO UNPLEASANT
AND INDEED I FIND A GREAT DIFFICULTY IN RENDERING MYSELF USEFUL WITH ANY LIKELIHOOD OF REALLY SUCCEEDING WITHOUT AT THE SAME EXPOSING MYSELF TO AN IMPUTATION OF IMPERTINENCE
AND SO HE WAS SHOWN INTO THAT GENTLEMAN'S OFFICIAL CABINET AND RECEIVED WITH THE USUAL LOFTY KINDNESS
AND HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE POLITELY INTIMATED SOMETHING OF THE KIND HAD NOT THE ENVELOPED OFFENDER MADE A SLIGHT AND LAZY TURN WHICH BURYING HIS CHIN STILL DEEPER IN HIS BREAST ALTOGETHER CONCEALED HIS EYES AND SO CLOSED THE OFFENSIVE SCRUTINY
THIS SINISTER CHANGE WAS SUDDEN AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THE SUGGESTION ABOUT THE REVERSION
PERHAPS IF HE HAD ACCEPTED WHAT SHE SAID IT MIGHT HAVE LED HIM TO NEW AND SOUNDER CONCLUSIONS
BUT THAT DON'T SIGNIFY MUCH ONLY THE HOUSE WILL COST ME A PRETTY PENNY TO GET IT INTO ORDER AND FURNISH
LARKIN HAD DRIVEN OFF EARLY TO FIVE OAKS TO MAKE INSPECTION OF HIS PURCHASE
THERE WAS A PICTURE IN THE OUTER HALL--ONE OF THOSE FULL-LENGTH GENTLEMEN OF GEORGE II.'S TIME WITH A DARK PERUKE FLOWING ON HIS SHOULDERS A CUT VELVET COAT AND LACE CRAVAT AND RUFFLES
I'VE ANTICIPATED HER HOWEVER DORKIE AND HE TOOK HER HAND AND KISSED IT
HE KNEW IT WOULD NOT DO TO LEAVE THE BODY SO AMONG THE ROCKS AND BRAMBLES
MR LARKIN IS IN POSSESSION OF ALL THE FAMILY PAPERS
AND BY JOVE THERE'S SURPLICE TOO AND HE'S GOOD FOR SEVEN VOTES
BUT SERIOUSLY RADIE YOU CAN BE I THINK VERY ESSENTIALLY OF USE TO ME IN THIS AFFAIR AND YOU MUST NOT REFUSE NOW STANLEY I WILL CUT THIS MATTER SHORT
EITHER WE HAVE MISTAKEN THE NIGHT OR SOMEBODY HAS TAKEN UPON HIM TO UPSET ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS
BUT HERE IN THIS NARROW WAY THERE MET HIM FULL A HATED SHADOW WHOM HE WOULD FAIN HAVE CUT BY LOOKING TO RIGHT OR LEFT OR UP OR DOWN BUT WHICH WAS NOT TO BE EVADED--WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE HIS SALUTATION BUT HIS ARM AND WALKED--A HORROR OF GREAT DARKNESS BY HIS SIDE--THROUGH THIS SOLITUDE
AND THERE ARE FEW STANLEY WHO WOULD NOT PREFER THE CERTAINTY OF THE WORST TO THE ANGUISH OF SUCH RELATIONS OF MYSTERY AND RESERVE WITH A HUSBAND
I OFTEN THOUGHT SINCE THAT HE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE WYLDER BEFORE HIM
AND REMEMBER TO SAY I HAVE NOT READ HER LETTER BUT IF I FIND IT REQUIRES AN ANSWER IT SHALL HAVE ONE HE LOOKED ROUND LIKE A MAN NEWLY AWAKENED AND UP AMONG THE GREAT BOUGHS AND INTERLACING FOLIAGE OF THE NOBLE TREES AND THE CHILD MADE HIM TWO COURTESIES AND DEPARTED TOWARDS REDMAN'S FARM
I ONCE KNEW HE CONTINUED A LITTLE MORE GRAVELY A MARRIAGE MADE UPON THAT PRINCIPLE AND NOT VERY AUDACIOUSLY EITHER WHICH TURNED OUT VERY UNHAPPILY SO I SHOULD CONJECTURE SHE SAID RISING FROM HER CHAIR RATHER DREARILY AND ABSTRACTEDLY AND THERE IS GOOD OLD LADY SARAH
AND IT CAME TO DORCAS IN A MORE AUTHENTIC FASHION THOUGH MYSTERIOUSLY AND RATHER IN THE GUISE OF A CONUNDRUM THAN OF A DISTINCT BIT OF FAMILY INTELLIGENCE FROM NO LESS A PERSON THAN THE OLD DOWAGER LADY CHELFORD HERSELF
PERHAPS IF YOU WERE TO FRAME YOUR QUESTION A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY I MIGHT POSSIBLY--A--YOU WERE SAYING I MEAN A MATTER OF VERY DEEP INTEREST TO ME SAID THE POOR VICAR COLOURING A LITTLE THOUGH NO VERY CONSIDERABLE SUM VIEWED ABSOLUTELY
WHAT OBJECT COULD HE GAIN FOR INSTANCE BY THE FIB HE HAD JUST TOLD ME
CHAPTER XVI
LORD CHELFORD HAD TAKEN HIS DEPARTURE AND YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT WHO PENS THESE PAGES HAD GONE FOR A FEW DAYS TO MALWICH
IT WAS THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN HERE IN THE MORNING--DUTTON IS HIS NAME AND SO IT IS REALLY HALF-PAST ELEVEN SAID LAKE IN A SLEEPY SURPRISE
BUT SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT SHE BECAME AN ENIGMA
ON THE CONTRARY I BELIEVE HE LIKED ME AS WELL AS HE WAS CAPABLE OF LIKING ANYBODY AND IT WAS NOW SEVEN YEARS SINCE WE HAD MET
AND SOMETIMES WHEN THEY MADE A FEAST AND EAT THEIR PENNYWORTH OF CHERRIES SITTING ON THE STYLE HE TREATED HIM I AM AFRAID TO THE PROFANE HISTORIES OF JACK THE GIANT-KILLER AND THE YELLOW DWARF
IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF MOBILITY--TRUE BEAUTY THERE IS A BEAUTY OF ANOTHER STAMP EQUALLY EXQUISITE MISS BRANDON AND PERHAPS MORE OVERPOWERING I SAID THIS IN NEARLY A WHISPER AND IN A VERY MARKED WAY ALMOST TENDER AND THE NEXT MOMENT WAS AMAZED AT MY OWN AUDACITY
I PAUSED LOOKING AT A PICTURE BUT THINKING OF HER AND WAS SURPRISED BY HER VOICE VERY NEAR ME
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU ARE SERIOUS DORCAS SAID LADY CHELFORD MORE ANXIOUSLY AND ALSO MORE GENTLY
WAS IT ELATION OR WAS THERE NOT SOMETHING WILDLY BITTER GLEAMING IN THAT SMILE
I DID NOT MEAN ANYTHING UPON MY HONOUR TAMAR THAT COULD ANNOY YOU
AND PRAY MY DEAR WHAT ARE THESE THESE CASKETS CONTAIN THE JEWELS WHICH MR WYLDER GAVE ME ABOUT SIX WEEKS SINCE
AS HE SUPPORTED HER IN HER CHAIR THE LIBRARY DOOR OPENED AND THE SINISTER FACE OF UNCLE LORNE LOOKED IN AND RETURNED THE CAPTAIN'S STARE WITH ONE JUST AS FIXED AND HORRIFIED
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT MORE THAN A MONTH HAD PASSED SINCE SHE SAW THE MILL-ROAD LAST
DORCAS MADE TWO KISSES OF IT AND RACHEL ONE BUT IT WAS COUSINLY AND KINDLY
YOU MAY HAVE TAKEN STEPS CAPTAIN LAKE UNDER A MISTAKE
A VISION MAYBE ECHOED THE CAVERNOUS TONES OF THE OLD MAN
BUT SHE'LL BE PRECIOUS SOBER BY TO-MORROW MORNING--AND I VENTURE TO SAY WE SHALL HEAR NOTHING MORE OF THAT SCHEME OF HERS
NO TAMAR I CAN'T STAY ANY LONGER NOW
A WONDERFUL INTEREST THOSE LITTLE PARK-LIKE BROKEN DELLS HAVE ALWAYS HAD FOR ME
YOU HAVE NO IDEA OF THE EXPENSE AND TROUBLE OF TITLE AND THE INEVITABLE COSTLINESS MY DEAR SIR OF ALL CONVEYANCING OPERATIONS
BUT THANK YOU WILD BESSIE FRANKLEYN YOU HAVE QUITE OPENED MY EYES
THIS GAVE TO HIS PLANS AND DEALINGS IN RELATION TO THE VICAR A CHARACTER OF IRRESOLUTION AND CAPRICE FOREIGN TO HIS CHARACTER WHICH WAS GRIM AND DECIDED ENOUGH WHEN HIS DATA WERE CLEAR AND HIS OBJECT IN SIGHT
CHAPTER XLIV
HITHERTO HIS ESCAPES HAD NOT LED TO SAFETY AND HE WAS ONLY RAISED FROM THE PIT TO BE SOLD TO THE ISHMAELITES
HE'S PROFLIGATE
HOWEVER HE TRIED THE EFFECT OF A DIRECT OBSERVATION
FROM HIM I LEARNED THAT JOS
AND HER CHEEKS FLUSHED ABOVE THE ROUGE AND HER EYES FLASHED SEVERELY
AND I WILL SAY--IT WOULD NOT BE FRANK AND CANDID TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE--THAT I HAVE OF LATE BEEN ANYTHING BUT SATISFIED WITH THE POSITION WHICH OSTENSIBLY YOUR PROFESSIONAL ADVISER AND CONFIDENTIAL MAN OF BUSINESS I HAVE OCCUPIED
WHILE MAKING MY TOILET FOR DINNER I AMUSED MYSELF BY CONJECTURING WHETHER THERE COULD BE ANY FOUNDATION IN FACT FOR MARK'S BOAST THAT MISS BRANDON LIKED HIM
YOU'LL USE YOUR DISCRETION IN MENTIONING THE SUBJECT SO THE CAPTAIN WAS NOW PREPARED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SECRET MEETING OF THE NIGHT BEFORE AND TO CORROBORATE THE TESTIMONY OF HIS ATTORNEY AND HIS BUTLER
WHAT SHALL I SAY COULD NOT HAVE A BETTER MAN
I'VE BEEN VERY PRESUMPTUOUS I FEAR TO-NIGHT MISS BRANDON HE SAID IN HIS PECULIAR LOW TONES
IS IT NOT HONESTLY A MERE NOISE AND INTERRUPTION--A MUSICAL CACKLING OF GEESE AND SILVERY BRAYING OF TINY ASSES
HE VANISHED FROM COURT LIKE AN EVIL SPIRIT INTO THE TORTURE-CHAMBER OF TAXATION
I MEAN I NEVER ENGAGE MYSELF BEYOND ONE DANCE
SOME JEWELS I THINK FOR DORCAS
HE PERHAPS CAN EXPLAIN
I NEVER KNEW ANYTHING WRONG IN THIS GYLINGDEN OFFICE
SO SHE SAID DORCAS AND I ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS
WAS IT CREDIBLE
WAS IT CREDIBLE
AND THAT THEY SEEMED VERY HERNEST LIKE AND STOPPED OF TALKING DIRECTLY HE MR LARCOM ENTERED THE ROOM WITH THE POST-BAG'--THE ATTORNEY KNEW VERY WELL WHAT WAS IN THE WIND
IT WAS THE SUCCESS OF THIS HIS FIRST STRATAGEM WHICH SUGGESTED THAT LONG SERIES OF FRAUDS WHICH WITH THE AID OF JIM DUTTON SELECTED FOR HIS STRIKING POINTS OF RESEMBLANCE TO MARK WYLDER HAD BEEN CARRIED ON FOR SO LONG WITH SUCH CONSUMMATE ART IN A DIFFERENT FIELD
YOU UNDERSTAND ME CLEARLY TAMAR YES MISS RADIE ANSWERED OLD TAMAR WONDER-STRICKEN WITH A STRANGE EXPRESSION OF FEAR IN HER FACE
STANLEY YOU ARE ISOLATING ME
LARCOM SHOUTED LAKE
DO YOU REALLY THINK--WELL IT HAS FREQUENTLY CROSSED MY MIND--BUT THE EXPENSE YOU KNOW
YOU MUST OBEY YOUR HUSBANDS CRIED THE DOWAGER WHO PUT DOWN NONSENSE WITH A HIGH HAND AND HAD RULED HER LORD WITH A ROD OF IRON
I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE AND SHE PUT A PRESENT IN HER HARD CRUMPLED HAND
IT WAS ONLY LADY CHELFORD AND THE MARCHIONESS WHO TALKED IT OVER--THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED IT VERY WELL
HOWEVER HE DOES SEE THE FUTILITY OF THIS
I WONDER HE DOES NOT WRITE--NO NOTHING OF MARK SHE FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE HALL
MARK HAD DONE SOME GOOD-NATURED THINGS FOR HIM IN A SMALL FIVE-POUND WAY
LARKIN THE REVERSION WOULD BE A BAD PURCHASE AT A HALFPENNY
WHY SHOULD THE WORLD BE CHEERFUL
I CAN'T DO IT STANLEY
WYLDER THE ORDER ON LAKE A LITTLE NOTE WAS ENCLOSED DEAR LAKE,--I WISH YOU JOY AND ALL THE GOOD WISHES GOING AS I COULD NOT MAKE THE PRIZE MYSELF
BUT HE DID NOT APPEAR AND STANLEY--THOUGH I NOW BELIEVE OBSERVED BY THIS STRANGE BEING--EXECUTED HIS HORRIBLE TASK REPLACED THE IMPLEMENTS AND RETURNED TO RACHEL AND WITH HER TO REDMAN'S FARM
BUT IT DESCRIBED UGLILY AND THE MAJOR CONSULTED IN BROKEN HINTS WITH AN UNEASY WINK OR TWO ABOUT A FLIGHT TO BOULOGNE
I ONLY KNOW TWO OF THEIR CLERGY--THE AFRICAN VICAR QUITE A GENTLEMAN AND SPEAKS THROUGH HIS NOSE
VERY LIKE MY HAND AND HE EXAMINED THE SEAL
HIS HEART WAS FAILING HIM FOR THE THINGS THAT WERE COMING TO PASS
ABOUT THREE WEEKS AFTER THE APPEARANCE OF THE ADVERTISEMENT IN GALIGNANI ONE OF MARK WYLDER'S LETTERS REACHED LARKIN
I'LL CONSULT LARKIN--SHALL I
IT WILL SOON BE OVER MY DARLING
SO I HAVE BUT QUITE ALONE AND WITHOUT EVER LEARNING WHO HE WAS I ANSWERED
HE HAD NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO SUBMIT TO FORTUNE WITH HIS BEST AIR
FOR THERE WERE CLEVER AND WITTY MEN AS WELL AS VERY BRAVE ONES IN IT
OR AS MEN IN MONEY PERPLEXITIES LOVE NOT THE SCRUTINY OF THEIR ACCOUNTS OR PAPERS YOU DON'T CARE TO TIRE YOUR EYES OVER THE DOCUMENTS IN THAT NEATLY JAPANNED BOX THE RESPECTABLE LAWYER'S CONSCIENCE
THE STIFF FIGURE OF MRS MARSTON THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER PALE AND AUSTERE IN RUSTLING BLACK SILK SHE WAS ACCOUNTED A MISER AND ESTIMATED TO HAVE SAVED I DARE NOT SAY HOW MUCH MONEY IN THE WYLDER FAMILY--KIND TO ME WITH THE BREAD-AND-JAM AND NAPLES-BISCUIT-KINDNESS OF HER SPECIES IN OLD TIMES)--STOOD IN FANCY AT THE DOORWAY
HE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE RECEIVED SOME UNEXPECTED CHECK--IF NOT CHECKMATE IN THAT DARK AND DEEP GAME ON WHICH HE SEEMED TO HAVE STAKED SO AWFULLY
HE MR LARKIN WAS TREATED LIKE A CHILD IN THIS MATTER AND HIS ADVICE NEVER SO MUCH AS ASKED NOR HIS PROFESSIONAL HONOUR ACCREDITED BY THE SMALLEST ACT OF CONFIDENCE
AND SO THE LITTLE ACCOUNT AS BETWEEN THE VICAR AND JOS
DON'T SAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE RACHEL SMILED ON THE GROUND AS BEFORE
NO DORCAS SAID RACHEL TAKING HER PROFFERED HAND IN THE SPIRIT IN WHICH IT WAS GIVEN AND WITH THE AIR RATHER OF A DEFIANCE THAN OF A GREETING
AND TELL HIM I SAY HE KNOWS WEALDON PRETTY WELL--HE MAY LOOK ON IT AS SETTLED
WE ARE BUSY HERE JUST NOW AND DON'T REQUIRE REVELATIONS IF YOU PLEASE THE OLD MAN LIFTED UP HIS LONG LEAN FINGER AND TURNED ON HIM WITH A SMILE WHICH I HATE EVEN TO REMEMBER
STOP SAID RACHEL SUDDENLY AS SHE REACHED ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE CHAPTER
AND WITHOUT ANSWERING SHE BEGAN MECHANICALLY TO GET ON HER CLOAK AND HAT
AND SOMEHOW THEY INTEREST ME UNSPEAKABLY
IS IT LADY MACBETH
YOU'VE A HEADACHE MISS RADIE SAID THE OLD WOMAN STANDING BY HER WITH THAT PAINFUL ENQUIRY WHICH SAT NATURALLY ON HER FACE
TELL HIM I SHALL PROBABLY SEE MR LARKIN MYSELF SAID THE CAPTAIN SNAPPISHLY
AND YOU REALLY WANTED A LITTLE FILLIP
BUT I COULD NOT HELP IT UNLESS I HAD TOLD EVERYTHING
I NEED HARDLY SAY CAPTAIN LAKE HOW I FEEL IN THIS BUSINESS
SO I AM CERTAIN WOULD RACHEL
THERE IS MUSIC AND DRAWING
AND AS HIS EYES RESTED ON THE FLYING DIORAMA OF TREES AND FARMSTEADS AND STANDING CROPS AND HE FELT ALREADY THE PRIDE OF A GREAT LANDED PROPRIETOR HIS LONG FINGERS FIDDLED PLEASANTLY WITH THE ROUGH TOOLING OF HIS MOROCCO LEATHER BOX
NOW DORKIE DARLING YOUR POOR SOLDIER HAS COME BACK RESOLVED TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF AND NEVER MORE TO RESERVE ANOTHER SEMBLANCE OF A SECRET FROM YOU SAID HE SO SOON AS HIS FIRST GREETING WAS OVER
THE VICAR TOLD HIM THE STORIES OF DAVID AND GOLIATH AND JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN AND OF THE WONDROUS BIRTH IN BETHLEHEM OF JUDEA THE STAR THAT LED THE WISE MEN AND THE CELESTIAL SONG HEARD BY THE SHEPHERDS KEEPING THEIR FLOCKS BY NIGHT AND SNATCHES OF PILGRIM'S PROGRESS
HE NEVER SPEAKS--ONLY A VOTE--AND A FELLOW THAT NEVER APPEARS TILL THE MINUTE BRITTLE THE MEMBER FOR STONEY-MUCKFORD WAS IN THE NEXT CARRIAGE TO ME YESTERDAY
IT WAS LAKE'S UNGOVERNED FURY WHEN LARKIN DISCOVERED THE MISTAKE IN POSTING THE LETTERS IN WRONG SUCCESSION WHICH SO NEARLY EXPLODED HIS INGENIOUS SYSTEM
WILL YOU TAKE ME FOR YOUR FOOTMAN AS FAR AS THE TOWN ASKED LORD CHELFORD
ALL ABOUT HIS BROTHER GEORGE
SIR HARRY WAS CHAFFING THE CAPTING AND HITTING HIM VERY HARD FOR A HUPSTART'--AND IN FACT CRUMP WAS MORE PARTICULAR IN REPORTING THE WORTHY BARONET'S LANGUAGE THAN WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
IT WAS RATHER A MARKED THING--AS LEAN MRS LOYD OF GYLINGDEN WHO HAD TWO THIN SPINSTERS WITH PINK NOSES UNDER HER WING REMARKED--THIS LONG WALK OF LORD CHELFORD AND MISS LAKE IN THE PARK
NOR DO I MR LARKIN AT PRESENT
A DEPUTATION OF THE TENANTRY OF THE GYLINGDEN AND THE LONGMOOR ESTATES TOGETHER WITH THOSE OF THE BRANDON ESTATE WENT IN PROCESSION TO BRANDON HALL IN THE AFTERNOON AND READ A WELL-CONCEIVED AND AFFECTIONATE ADDRESS WHICH WAS RESPONDED TO IN APPROPRIATE TERMS BY CAPTAIN LAKE WHO RECEIVED THEM WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE AT HIS SIDE IN THE GREAT GALLERY--PERHAPS THE NOBLEST APARTMENT IN THAT NOBLE ANCESTRAL MANSION
WELL RADIE I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU ONE THING THAT I'M RESOLVED TO CARRY OUT SAID LAKE WITH A DREAMY SERENITY LOOKING ON THE DARK CARPET
AND HE SAID I GRANT THEE THY BOON GENTLE JOAN
I KNOW ST ANGE YOU'LL LIKE TO ASSIST SO LARCOM WITHDREW CEREMONIOUSLY AND LORD CHELFORD HASTENED HIS TOILET AND WAS DOWN STAIRS AND IN THE ROOM ASSIGNED BY THE HOUSEKEEPER TO THE ILL-STARRED CAPTAIN LAKE BEFORE DOCTOR BUDDLE HAD ARRIVED
NOTHING FOR ME BY-THE-WAY NO LETTER
THERE RAGE THE ELEMENTS WHICH GOD ONLY CAN CONTROL
I'M NOT JOKING CHARLIE UPON MY WORD THOUGH I'M LAUGHING MARK SWORE NOW AND THEN BUT I TAKE LEAVE TO SOFTEN HIS OATHS IT WAS THE PERSIAN MAGICIAN COME MARK SAY WHAT YOU MEAN I MEAN WHAT I SAY
AND PERHAPS YOU BEAR IN MIND THAT DESIGN CALLED THE ELECTOR IN WHICH THE PRINCE EMERGING FROM HIS PALACE GATE WITH A CLOUD OF COURTIERS BEHIND IS MET BY A POOR WOMAN HER LITTLE CHILD BY THE HAND APPEALING TO HIS COMPASSION DESPISING WHOM HE TURNS AWAY WITH A SERENE DISDAIN
YES DORKIE I'M HERE AT LAST
THUS WAS THE GOOD MAN'S DAY CONSUMED
SOMETHING IN THE GENERAL CHARACTER
WAITING IN THE DRAWING-ROOM I HAD SOME ENTERTAINING TALK WITH MISS LAKE
HE COULD NOT SUPPRESS HIS GRINS
THE HUMAN MIND IS FERTILE IN THAT SORT OF GROWTH
I'VE BEEN VERY IMPORTUNATE--I PRIZED THE HONOUR I SOUGHT SO VERY MUCH I FORGOT HOW LITTLE I DESERVED IT
MARGERY BRING THE BASKET IN
EH CAN HE POSSIBLY
IS THERE ANY THING ELSE JUST NOW YOU THINK OF FOR TIME PRESSES AND REALLY WE HAVE GROUND TO APPREHEND SOMETHING UNPLEASANT TO-MORROW
THERE WAS A MEDITATIVE FRAGRANCE OF CIGARS ABOUT HIM AND TWO OR THREE HAVANNAH STUMPS UNDER THE GRATE
CAN I HAVE MISTAKEN THE NAME BUT NO
MARK WYLDER HAD AS YOU PERCEIVE RATHER VAGUE NOTIONS OF DECENCY AND NOT MUCH EXPERIENCE OF LADIES
AND AFTER ANOTHER VERY CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL AT THE END OF WHICH SHE SHUT THE MINIATURE IN ITS CASE SHE SAID IT WAS A PECULIAR FACE AND VERY BEAUTIFUL
I CAN NEVER CEASE TO MOURN OVER MY MADNESS
TEN--_TWENTY TO ONE--IT IS THE OLD STORY--SOME UNFORTUNATE FEMALE CONNECTION--SOME AMBIGUOUS RELATION INVOLVING A DOUBTFUL MARRIAGE AND JOSIAH LARKIN TURNED UP HIS SMALL PINK EYES AND SHOOK HIS TALL BALD HEAD GENTLY AND MURMURED AS HE NODDED IT THE SINS OF HIS YOUTH FIND HIM OUT
YOU KNOW HE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD
BUT THEY WERE ONLY RECEIVED AND LED TO NOTHING
IN WHICH MISS RACHEL LAKE COMES TO BRANDON AND DOCTOR BUDDLE CALLS AGAIN
AND THIS MUST GO ON SO LONG AS THE STATE OF MAN IS IMPERFECT AND PLENTY OF POSSIBLE EVIL IN FUTURITY
I'M AFRAID IT'S A SELFISH WORLD MR WYLDER AND THINKS VERY LITTLE OF WHAT DOES NOT CONCERN IT NOW YOU I DARE SAY CONTINUED WYLDER NOT CARING TO PERCEIVE THE SOUPCON OF SARCASM THAT MODULATED HER ANSWER SO MUSICALLY LOOK UPON ME AS A VERY FORTUNATE FELLOW YOU ARE A VERY FORTUNATE PERSON MR WYLDER
I HAVE NO BUSINESS TO UNDERTAKE THIS TRUST SIMPLE AS IT IS I HAVE ONLY MY LORD TO BOW TO YOUR LORDSHIP'S DECISION
DOLLY WILLIAM DON'T LOOK SO FRIGHTENED
THE TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS WHILE HE PARTED LITTLE FAIRY'S GOLDEN HAIR WITH HIS FINGERS
MY BROTHER MARK MR LARKIN SMILED A SAD AND SIMPLE SMILE AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
ALSO TO INSTRUCT ME WHAT YOU AUTHORISE ME TO SAY SHOULD I BE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO MEET HIM
AND THIS INCIDENT OVER THEY BROKE UP GRADUALLY INTO LITTLE GROUPS IN SUNDAY GUISE AND MANY COLOURS SOME FOR A RAMBLE ON THE COMMON AND SOME TO TEA ACCORDING TO THE PRIMITIVE HOURS THAT RULED OLD GYLINGDEN
I SWEAR IT IF YOU LIKE
THIS OF COURSE WAS TO AWAIT MR WYLDER'S PERFECT CONVENIENCE
THE SLEEPY CLERK THAT NIGHT IN THE DOLLINGTON STATION STAMPED TWO FIRST-CLASS TICKETS FOR LONDON ONE OF WHICH WAS FOR A GENTLEMAN AND THE OTHER FOR A CLOAKED LADY WITH A VERY THICK VEIL WHO STOOD OUTSIDE ON THE PLATFORM
THE BONES AND JOINTS MA'AM OF A CASE
LARKIN'S FACE AND HE WAS PLAINLY MEDITATING A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLY AS THEY APPROACHED THE QUIET GREEN OF GYLINGDEN
FAREWELL MR WYLDER FAREWELL
THERE'S NO MAN ON EARTH WHO CAN TELL ANYTHING OF ME OR PUT ME UNDER ANY SORT OF PRESSURE THANK HEAVEN
THE COMPANION DISCLOSES HIMSELF
AND LITTLE FAIRY WILL GO TOO
HIS ADDRESS IS RATHER A WIDE ONE TOO--LONDON
HE IS CERTAINLY AND LAKE LOOKED AT US AS HE ADDED THESE LAST WORDS IN TURN WITH A QUICK SUSPICIOUS GLANCE AS IF HE HAD SAID SOMETHING RASH AND DOUBTED WHETHER WE HAD OBSERVED IT
HIS MIND WAS ALREADY FULL OF THESE PROJECTS
SO MARGERY SITTING UPON HER STOOL IN THE BACKGROUND--FOR THE QUEEN HAD SAID IT AND SIT SHE MUST--AND GRINNING FROM EAR TO EAR IN A GREAT HALO OF GLORY PARTOOK OF TEA
QUITE SO SAID THE CAPTAIN LOOKING UP SUDDENLY AS WAS HIS WAY WITH A MOMENTARY GLARE LIKE A MAN NEWLY-WAKED FROM A NARCOTIC DOZE
MY IDEA WAS THAT LORD CHELFORD WOULD SEE MORE CLEARLY WHAT WAS BEST FOR LITTLE FAIRY
LITTLE MAN WILL BE TAKEN BY HIS SAVIOUR THAT LOVES HIM BEST OF ALL--AND HE'LL BE IN HEAVEN--AND ONLY HAVE A SHORT TIME TO WAIT AND MAYBE HIS POOR WAPSIE WILL COME TO HIM PLEASE GOD AND HIS DARLING MAMMA--AND WE'LL ALL BE HAPPY TOGETHER FOR EVER AND NEVER BE SICK OR SORRY ANY MORE MY TREASURE--MY LITTLE FAIRY--MY DARLING AND LITTLE MAN LOOKED ON HIM WITH HIS TIRED EYES NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT MEANT NOR WHY WAPSIE WAS CRYING
ON A VERY LITTLE MORE AT ALL EVENTS
AND I SUPPOSE OTHER MODEST MEN ARE NOT ALWAYS PROOF AGAINST SIMILAR FLATTERIES OF IMAGINATION
AND I AM SURE WE SHALL ALL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE ON SEEING SIR FRANCIS SEDDLEY
BUT THE BEST MAN CANNOT MANAGE A DIALOGUE ALONE
BEFORE LUNCHEON CAPTAIN LAKE ARRIVED
LARKIN PROCEEDED AUTOMATICALLY IN THE IMMORTAL STRUCTURE OF THAT GENTLEMAN
BUT I THINK HE COMES IT A LITTLE TOO STRONG--TWO SERMONS LAST SUNDAY AND A PRAYER-MEETING AT NINE O'CLOCK WELL IT WON'T DO HIM ANY HARM I REPEATED
BUT THERE WERE NO SUCH FOPPERIES TO HURRY OFF THE STAGE DISCONCERTED
THANK HEAVEN AT LEAST FOR THAT
AND SEEING SO GOOD A SITUATION WAS TO BE HAD AND THINKING YOU THE FITTEST MAN I KNOW I WISHED TO SERVE YOU AND MY FRIEND AT THE SAME TIME DUTTON BECAME GRATEFUL AND DOCILE UPON THIS
OTHERS SET HIM DOWN AS A GENTLEMAN IN DIFFICULTIES OF SOME SORT WHO WAS USING GYLINGDEN FOR A TEMPORARY REFUGE
I DARE SAY IT IS VERY IMPRUDENT AND I DON'T DENY THAT MR WYLDER MAY HAVE REASON TO COMPLAIN OF ME AND THE WORLD WILL NOT SPARE ME EITHER
HER READING WAS VERY SLOW AND HAD OTHER FAULTS TOO BEING IN THAT SING-SONG STYLE TO WHICH SOME PEOPLE INEXPLICABLY LIKE TO READ HOLY WRIT
HE HAD HIS TWO OR THREE SHELVES OF BOOKS IN THE RECESS
OUR BRIGHT DARLING I THINK DOLLY WE COULD NOT LIVE HERE
IT WAS THE PARSONAGE AND OLD BACHELOR DOCTOR CREWE THE RECTOR IN MY NONAGE STILL STOOD IN MEMORY AT THE DOOR IN HIS BLACK SHORTS AND GAITERS WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND A PUCKERED SMILE ON HIS HARD RUDDY COUNTENANCE AS I APPROACHED
THOU SHALT NOT CAST AN EYE OF DESIRE
I FORGET ITS NAME
AND THEN SIDE-BY-SIDE THEY PACED DOWN THE BROAD WALK BY ITS EDGE
SHE PLACED HER HAND ON HIS AND STEPPED TO THE GROUND
BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES LOOK ODD
POOR STANLEY SHE MURMURED WITH A KIND OF AGONY LOOKING DOWN UPON THAT CHANGED FACE
AND IN THE SAME DEJECTED WAY SHE SIPPED IT SLOWLY
AND THE MAID BEING WANTED AT HOME OLD TAMAR UNDERTOOK THE MESSAGE TO BRANDON HALL WHERE HER YOUNG MISTRESS WAS AND SALLIED FORTH IN HER CLOAK AND BONNET UNDER THE HAUNTED TREES OF REDMAN'S DELL
STAY A MOMENT I'M GOING SAID STANLEY OVERTAKING AND CONFRONTING HER NEAR THE DOOR
AND THERE WAS A LITTLE REMINDER FROM GOOD JOS
DOCTOR BUDDLE HAS BEEN VERY KIND--BUT HE IS I AM AFRAID MORE DESPONDING THAN POOR WILLIAM OR DOLLY IMAGINES--HEAVEN HELP THEM BUT CHILDREN RECOVER WONDERFULLY
MAKING THE MOST OF HIS HEIGHT WHICH HE FANCIED ADDED MUCH TO THE ARISTOCRATIC EFFECT OF HIS PRESENCE WITH HIS HEAD THROWN BACK AND SWINGING HIS WALKING CANE EASILY BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB BY HIS SIDE HE STRODE LANGUIDLY THROUGH THE MAIN STREET OF GYLINGDEN IN THE HAPPY BELIEF THAT HE WAS MAKING A SENSATION AMONG THE DENIZENS OF THE TOWN
BUT I STARTED WITH HIM AND WE WALKED TOGETHER UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS GOING AS USUAL TO THE INN THE--WHAT D'YE CALL IT?--"BRANDON ARMS AND IT WAS A SUDDEN THOUGHT--NOW I THINK OF IT--FOR HE TOOK NO LUGGAGE THOUGH TO BE SURE I DARE SAY HE HAS GOT CLOTHES AND THINGS IN TOWN AND WHEN DOES HE RETURN IN A DAY OR TWO AT FURTHEST HE SAID
TELL LORD CHELFORD I WISH VERY MUCH TO SEE HIM HERE SO AWAY WENT THE MAID AGAIN
THIS IS HIS LADY YOU KNOW HALLO
I'VE A WORD TO SAY--YOU MUST PAUSE IF IT AFFECTS OUR BUSINESS MISS LAKE I DO REQUEST THAT YOU ADDRESS YOURSELF TO ME
THIS YOUNG LADY'S LITTLE EDEN THOUGH OVERSHADOWED AND ENCOMPASSED WITH THE SOLEMN SYLVAN CLOISTER OF NATURE'S BUILDING AND VOCAL WITH SOUNDS OF INNOCENCE--THE SONGS OF BIRDS AND SOMETIMES THOSE OF ITS YOUNG MISTRESS--WAS NO MORE PROOF THAN THE MESOPOTAMIAN HAUNT OF OUR FIRST PARENTS AGAINST THE INTRUSION OF DARKER SPIRITS
THE STEPS WERE NOT THOSE OF A MAN WALKING BRISKLY WITH A PURPOSE
VERY TIRED BUT NOT AT ALL SLEEPY--ON THE CONTRARY EXCITED AND NERVOUS AND RATHER RELIEVED NOTWITHSTANDING THAT STANLEY HAD LEFT HER TO WALK HOME ALONE
THIS SMALL APPENDIX WAS THUS CONCEIVED P.S.--TOM WEALDON AS USUAL DEEP IN ELECTIONS UNDER THE ROSE BEGS YOU KINDLY TO BRING DOWN WHATEVER YOU THINK TO BE THE BEST BOOK OR BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT AND HE WILL REMIT TO YOUR BOOKSELLER
AND I SUPPOSE I MAY SAY TO THEM THAT YOU SEE THE NECESSITY OF DISPOSING OF THE REVERSION AND AGREE TO SELL IT IF IT BE NOT TOO LATE THE VICAR ASSENTED
WHAT A WORLD IT IS TO BE SURE THOUGHT MR LARKIN AS HE SHOOK HIS LONG HEAD OVER DUTTON'S LETTER
CERTAINLY OUR GOOD PEOPLE DO OCCUPY SOME SPACE HERE
I THINK ON REFLECTION YOU WILL SEE THAT MR WYLDER--THE REVEREND WILLIAM WYLDER AND HIS LADY--COULD NOT FOR ONE MOMENT SERIOUSLY ENTERTAIN IT AND THAT I WHO AM BOUND TO DO THE BEST I CAN FOR THEM COULD NOT DREAM OF ADVISING IT I FANCY IT IS A MATTER OF TOTAL INDIFFERENCE SIR WHAT YOU MAY AND WHAT YOU MAY NOT ADVISE IN A MATTER QUITE BEYOND YOUR PROVINCE--I DON'T IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND OR DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND YOU--AND THINKING YOUR MANNER IMPERTINENT AND OFFENSIVE I BEG THAT YOU WILL NOW BE SO GOOD AS TO LEAVE MY HOUSE MISS RACHEL WAS VERY ANGRY--ALTHOUGH NOTHING BUT HER BRIGHT COLOUR AND THE VEXED FLASH OF HER EYE SHOWED IT
AND WE WERE NOW TRAVERSING THE HOMELY AND ANTIQUE STREET OF THE LITTLE TOWN WITH ITS QUEER SHOPS AND SOLID STEEP-ROOFED RESIDENCES
WHY SHOULD NOT I SHARE IN THE PROFIT--IF SUCH THERE BE--BY GETTING MY HAND TOO UPON THE INSTRUMENT OF COMPRESSION
YOU ARE VERY LOYAL MR DE CRESSERON AND WITHOUT AWAITING MY REPLY SHE MADE SOME REMARK WHICH I FORGET TO LADY CHELFORD WHO SAT AT A LITTLE DISTANCE
I DON'T I THINK RECOLLECT ANY PARTICULAR SMITH JUST AT THIS MOMENT
MORE SERIOUS THAN YOU SUPPOSE ANSWERED LARKIN WITH A SHAKE OF HIS HEAD
I CAN'T HELP IT
I CAN'T HELP IT
AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE WAS ADMITTED INTO THE TINY DRAWING-ROOM IN WHICH THE CAPTAIN LAY
TAMAR TAMAR
STANLEY LAKE AND HIS SISTER DINED NEXT DAY AT BRANDON
WELL THOUGHT THE VICAR THAT MUNIFICENT OFFER IS UNAVAILING IT SEEMS
HE WOULD BE ON ANOTHER ERRAND BY THE TIME THE WRIT CAME DOWN
BUT THEY HAVE NO CHANCE WITH THE GIPSIES
AND A VERY SERENE COMPANION HE WAS IF NOT VERY BRILLIANT
THE ATTORNEY TOLD DOWN THE MONEY IN BANK BILLS
I WAS ALWAYS A LOVER OF SUCH ANTIQUITIES BUT I CONFESS AT THAT MOMENT I WOULD HAVE VASTLY PREFERRED A SPRIGHTLY MODERN CHINTZ AND A TRUMPERY LITTLE FRENCH BED IN A CORNER OF THE BRANDON ARMS
I KEEP THIS CLOSED SAID OLD TAMAR AND FORBID HER TO CROSS IT LEST SHE SHOULD DISTURB THE MISTRESS
THAT WILL DO
DON'T MOVE ME AND IN A MINUTE MORE--'DON'T MIND THAT D--D BRUTE
THE FASCINATION WAS DISTURBED BY A NOISE AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AND I SAW LAKE STANDING CLOSE TO HIM AND LOOKING BOTH ANGRY AND FRIGHTENED
AND WILLIAM WYLDER WHOSE CHARACTER SIMPLY AND SENSITIVELY HONOURABLE MR LARKIN APPRECIATED WAS TO WRITE TO BURLINGTON AND SMITH A LETTER FOR THE SATISFACTION OF THEIR SPECULATIVE AND NERVOUS CLIENT PLEDGING HIS HONOUR AS A GENTLEMAN AND HIS CONSCIENCE AS A CHRISTIAN THAT IN THE EVENT OF THE SALE BEING COMPLETED HE WOULD NEVER DO COUNTENANCE OR PERMIT ANY ACT OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER TENDING ON ANY GROUND TO IMPEACH OR INVALIDATE THE TRANSACTION
SHE WAS DRESSED GRAVELY BUT RICHLY AND RECEIVED ME KINDLY--AND STRANGE TO SAY WITH A SMILE THAT YET WAS NOT JOYFUL
AND A SECOND COVENANT BINDING HIM AND THE TRUSTEES OF THE SETTLEMENT AGAINST EXECUTING ANY DEED C WITHOUT A SIMILAR CONSENT
THE GIGANTIC BROCKEN SPECTRE PROJECTED FROM HIMSELF UPON THE WIDE HORIZON OF HIS FUTURITY
IT WAS BY THE DROWSY FADED LIGHT OF A LATE SUMMER'S EVENING THAT HE ARRIVED AT THE QUAINT LITTLE PARSONAGE
AND QUEEN'S BRACTON IS A VERY NICE THING YOU KNOW YES SO THEY SAID
WHY IS HIS WORK SO ILL DONE WHEN HE OUGHT MOST TO EXERT HIMSELF
MESSRS
IT IS PERFECTLY PLAIN WE SHOULD SELL
COME MAKE A CUP OF TEA AND TELL US A STORY AND FRIGHTEN ME AND MARGERY BEFORE WE GO TO OUR BEDS
VERY WELL AND THE TALL ATTORNEY ROSE AND FACING THE RURAL PROSPECT AT HIS WINDOW WITH HIS BACK TO MR LARCOM HE READ WITH A FAINT SMILE THE FEW LINES IN A DELICATE HAND CONSENTING TO THE SALE OF FIVE OAKS
AND AFTER IT HAD EXHIBITED ITSELF IN THE WAY I HAVE SAID CAPTAIN LAKE OPENED A LITTLE DESPATCH-BOX AND TOOK THEREFROM A FOREIGN LETTER BUT THREE DAYS RECEIVED
THEY TALK OF ITALIAN EVENINGS
WON'T YOU AYE BY-GONES ARE BY-GONES
MR LARCOM WAS A GOOD DEAL EXCITED
THE VICAR AND JOHN HUGHES CLERK AND SEXTON WERE LAST OUT
COULD I SAY JUST A WORD WITH YOU--THIS WAY A LITTLE
THE WORST IS THAT ITS TENDENCIES ARE SO GODLESS
AND HE NEVER LOST AN OPPORTUNITY OF CONVEYING HIS OPINION OF SIR MULGRAVE SOMETIMES IN DISTINCT AND CONFIDENTIAL SENTENCES AND SOMETIMES ONLY BY A SAD SHAKE OF HIS HEAD OR BY AWFULLY DECLINING TO SPEAK UPON THE SUBJECT
W WITHIN WAS WHAT HE CALLED HIS NOTICE TO STANLEY LAKE AND IT WAS THUS CONCEIVED PRIVATE DEAR LAKE--I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE ALL SAFE FOR NEXT ELECTION IN DOLLINGTON OR THE COUNTY
ONLY SUDDENLY HE LOOKED UP AND SAID QUIETLY VERY WELL
THEY TELL ME HE WAS SEEN AT ANCONA SAID LAKE TRANQUILLY
HE IS NOT SURPRISED IF THE PATIENT'S MIND WANDERS A LITTLE AT TIMES
THEY HAD COST HIM SOMETHING AND HE HAD NOT ANY MORE SPARE BREAD JUST THEN TO THROW UPON THE WATERS
SHE'S A MERE FIGUREHEAD
WOULD TO HEAVEN I WERE DEAD
AND APPEARING QUITE ABSORBED IN HER NEW SUBJECT SHE PLACED HERSELF CLOSE BESIDE THE DOWAGER AND CONTINUED TO CHAT IN A LOW TONE
IS HE REALLY TOO DEEP FOR YOU
WELL NOW THOUGH REALLY IT IS FUNNY
THE GIRL SCREAMED AND A CRASH OF GLASS AND CROCKERY WHISKED AWAY BY THEIR COATS RESOUNDED ON THE GROUND
BOTH TIRED
I WISH WE WERE QUIETLY RID OF HIM HE IS SUCH AN UNSCRUPULOUS DOG
BUT YES OF COURSE SAID LAKE
AT THE SAME TIME I CANNOT BUT FEEL MY LORD HOW PECULIAR AND PAINFUL IS THE POSITION IN WHICH IT PLACES ME
AND IN LIKE MANNER ON BEHALF OF STANLEY WILLIAMS BRANDON LAKE OF BRANDON HALL IN THE COUNTY OF ESQ
I TOLD HIM I WAS BETTER THAN HE IN MY HUMBLE OPINION AND SO I AM BY CHALKS
JUST A LITTLE BETTER WHISPERED HIS MAMMA LOOKING AS ALL THE REST WERE ON THAT WAN SAD LITTLE FACE
AND SUCH A PAIR OF WOMEN--WITCHES BY JOVE!--AND THAT RASCALLY GROOM AND A HYPOCRITICAL ATTORNEY
GLIDING NEAR THE LIDO--WHERE SO MANY RINGS OF DOGES LIE LOST BENEATH THE WAVES--I HEARD THE PLEASANT SOUND OF FEMALE VOICES UPON THE WATER--AND THEN WITH A SUDDEN GLORY ROSE A SAD WILD HYMN LIKE THE MUSICAL WAIL OF THE FORSAKEN SEA THE SPOUSELESS ADRIATIC MOURNS HER LORD
IT WAS ODD IN THE SORT OF GHASTLY BANTER IN WHICH HE PLAYED OFF THIS OLD MAN HOW MUCH HATRED WAS PERCEPTIBLE
I'M AS WHITE AS GEHAZI EXCEPT ON MY HEAD WHEN THAT BLOOD COMES SAYING WHICH HE ROSE ABRUPTLY AND WITH LONG JERKING STEPS LIMPED TO THE DOOR AT WHICH I SAW IN THE SHADE THE FACE OF A DARK-FEATURED MAN LOOKING GLOOMILY IN
OTHERS KNEW HE WAS STAYING WITH MR LARKIN AND SUPPOSED HE WAS TRYING TO RAISE MONEY AT DISADVANTAGE AND REMARKED THAT SOME OF MR LARKIN'S CLIENTS LOOKED ALWAYS UNHAPPY THOUGH THEY HAD SO GODLY AN ATTORNEY TO DEAL WITH
LAKE FANCIED THAT THE MAN WAS DRIVING WRONG ONCE OR TWICE AND WAS ON THE POINT OF CURSING HIM TO THAT EFFECT FROM THE WINDOW
IT WAS NOW THE BUTLER'S TURN TO LISTEN WHICH HE DID AT THE HALF-OPENED DOOR OF HIS ROOM
A BAT ATTRACTED THITHER LIKE HIMSELF WAS FLITTING AND FLICKERING THIS WAY AND THAT ACROSS THE CASEMENT
AS I COULD BE OF NO POSSIBLE USE IN LOCAL DETAILS I LEFT THE COUNCIL OF WAR SITTING INTENDING A STROLL IN THE GROUNDS
IN THE LIGHT OF THIS CELESTIAL ILLUSION SHE STOOD NOW BY THE PIANO TURNING OVER THE PAGES OF POOR TOM MOORE AS I HAVE SAID WHEN A LOW PLEASANT VOICE NEAR HER SAID I WAS SO GLAD TO SEE THAT DORCAS HAD PREVAILED AND THAT YOU WERE HERE
MR WYLDER'S SETTLEMENTS WERE NOT SATISFACTORY IT WAS PRESUMED OR THE YOUNG LADY COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO LIKE HIM OR HOWEVER IT CAME TO PASS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THAT SPRIG OF WILLOW INEVITABLY TO BE MOUNTED BY HERO OR HEROINE UPON SUCH EQUIVOCAL OCCASIONS WAS PLACED BY THE HONEST TOWN BY NO MEANS IN HER BREAST BUT ALTOGETHER IN HIS BUTTON-HOLE
AND IF THERE SHOULD TURN OUT TO BE ANYTHING NOT QUITE STRAIGHT GOING ON AT THE POST-OFFICE OF GYLINGDEN--HITHERTO AN UNIMPEACHED INSTITUTION--HE HAD NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT THAT DARK AND SINUOUS SPIRIT WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
THERE WAS ONLY ONE LETTER--THE ADDRESS WAS WRITTEN--'MISS LAKE REDMAN'S FARM NEAR BRANDON PARK GYLINGDEN IN A STIFF HAND RATHER SLANTING BACKWARDS
I WAS NOT SURE BUT I WAS AFRAID
UPON THAT PURCHASE HOWEVER THE GOOD ATTORNEY HAD CAST HIS EYE
THEN HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A RUSTLING OF THE LEAVES NEAR HIM AND HE HALLOOED WHO'S THERE BUT NO ANSWER CAME
I DON'T KNOW RACHEL WHAT TO THINK OF ANYONE OR ANYTHING
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT
AND WHEN INTENDING TO MAKE PEACE BETWEEN THEM I ALLUDED TO IT JUST BEFORE WE LEFT AND BRACTON SAID IT WAS REALLY NOTHING--QUITE BLOWN OVER--AND THAT HE COULD NOT RECOLLECT WHAT EITHER HAD SAID
AN IMPRACTICABILITY TOO
LORD CHELFORD COULD NOT DESERT THE YOUNG LADY AND WOULD IT HAVE BEEN A VERY NICE DELICACY IN MISS LAKE TO MAKE HER COURTESY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK AND PROTEST AGAINST PURSUING THEIR WALK TOGETHER ANY FURTHER
THE SHEAF OF LETTERS LAY BEFORE HIM ON THE TABLE LIKE CORNELIUS AGRIPPA'S BLOODY BOOK'--A THING TO CONJURE WITH
AND REALLY I DO NOT MYSELF KNOW THAT CONSIDERING POOR WILLIAM'S LIABILITIES AND HIS MEANS AND HOW MANY CHANCES THERE WERE AGAINST THAT REVERSION EVER BECOMING A FACT THAT I WOULD NOT MYSELF HAVE ADVISED HIS SELLING IT IF A REASONABLE PRICE WERE OBTAINABLE
DID YOU SEE STANLEY
THE VICAR KNEW HIM_--_HE NEVER PRESSED ANY MAN
SO THE ATTORNEY LOWERED THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT
HE PUT HIS HAND UNDER THE CLOTHES AND FELT HIS THIN SLENDER LIMBS--THINNER THAN EVER NOW
I KNOW HER BROTHER A LITTLE--THAT IS CAPTAIN LAKE--STANLEY LAKE
WHAT IS HE DOING NOW SAID LAKE IN THE SAME LANGUID WAY HIS ELBOWS ON THE ARMS OF HIS CHAIR STOOPING FORWARD AND LOOKING SERENELY ON THE FLOOR LIKE A MAN WHO IS TIRED OF HIS WORK AND ENJOYS HIS RESPITE
SO MUFFLED UP I COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
AT ALL EVENTS SHE DRANK SOME WINE
THIS IS WHAT IT SEEMED
THE BEST THING I TAKE IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED MINISTERS HA HA HA
AND HE ALWAYS SHAPED HIM SOMEHOW AFTER THE OUTLINES OF A GRIZZLY PRINT HE REMEMBERED IN HIS BOYISH DAYS OF A MANIAC CHAINED IN A SICILIAN CELL GROVELLING UNDER THE LASH OF A HALF-SEEN GAOLER AND WITH HIS TEETH BURIED IN HIS OWN ARM
HOW OFTEN HAD STANLEY LAKE SWORN TO HER THERE WAS NO SECRET
I TOLD YOU HE WAS COMING UP--LEND HIM A HAND YELLED UNCLE LORNE IN GREAT EXCITEMENT
THE TRAGIC SHADOW OF HER LIFE HAS NOT CHILLED LORD CHELFORD'S STRONG AFFECTION
I'M A BIT THAT WAY MYSELF
I'LL BE SURE TO UNDERSTAND WELL MISS--I MEAN RACHEL DEAR--YOU KNOW--I MAY TELL YOU NOW--THE VICAR--MY DEAR WILLIE--HE AND I--WE'VE BEEN IN GREAT TROUBLE--OH SUCH TROUBLE--HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS AND SHE DRIED HER EYES QUICKLY--'MONEY MY DEAR AND SHE SMILED WITH A BEWILDERED SHRUG--'SOME DEBTS AT CAMBRIDGE--NO FAULT OF HIS--YOU CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT A SAVING DARLING HE IS--BUT THESE WERE A FEW OLD THINGS THAT MOUNTED UP WITH INTEREST MY DEAR--YOU UNDERSTAND--AND LAW COSTS--OH YOU CAN'T THINK--AND INDEED DEAR MISS--WELL RACHEL_--I FORGOT--I SOMETIMES THOUGHT WE MUST BE QUITE RUINED OH DOLLY DEAR SAID RACHEL VERY PALE I FEARED IT
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD BROKEN DOWN THE FIRST TIME AT LEAST THE VICAR HAD SEEN HER ANYTHING BUT CHEERY AND HIS HEAD SANK AND IT SEEMED AS IF HIS LAST LIGHT HAD GONE OUT AND HE WAS QUITE BENIGHTED
A SLANTING BEAM FROM THE WINDOW GLIMMERED ON HIS TALL BALD HEAD AND HIS FACE WAS BLACK AND MENACING AS THE SUMMIT OF A THUNDER-CROWNED PEAK
NOW I CAN'T TELL MISS LAKE AS YOU LOOK ON TOM MOORE THERE AND I TRY TO READ YOUR SMILE WHETHER YOU HAPPEN AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT TO ADORE OR DESPISE HIM MOORE'S IS A DARING MORALITY--WHAT DO YOU THINK FOR INSTANCE OF THESE LINES SHE SAID TOUCHING THE VERSE WITH HER BOUQUET
I SUPPOSE EVERYTHING WENT OFF PLEASANTLY
LARKIN WAS NOW MOVING ALONE UNDER THE LIMBS OF THE BRANDON TREES
AND DETESTING OLD LADY CHELFORD FOR SUNDRY SLIGHTS AND SMALL IMPERTINENCES AND ENVYING BRANDON AND ITS BELONGINGS WAS RESOLVED NOT TO BE PUT DOWN BY PRESUMPTION IN THAT QUARTER
I LOVE YOUR BROTHER
ONCE OR TWICE INDEED OF THE MOST ALARMING NATURE
QUITE SO
QUITE SO
I DON'T THINK SIR HE WOULD WRITE TWO LETTERS ONE REFERRING BACK TO THE OTHER AT THE SAME TIME AND POST AND DATE THE LATTER MORE THAN A WEEK BEFORE THE OTHER OH SAID LAKE QUIETLY FOR THE FIRST TIME EXHIBITING A SLIGHT CHANGE OF COUNTENANCE AND LOOKING PEEVISH AND EXCITED
YEARS I DARE SAY AND A HARD LIFE AND PROFLIGACY AND COMMAND HAD NOT MADE HIM LESS SELFISH OR MORE HUMANE OR ABATED HIS CRAFT AND RESOLUTION
NO SIR
NO MAN HAD I BELIEVE A HIGHER REPUTATION IN HIS WALK--FEW MEN WERE MORE FORMIDABLE
YOU QUITE MISTAKE I AM PERSUADED MY GOOD FRIEND MR LARKIN
YOU MUST DRINK SOME WINE FIRST
DO YOU SUPPOSE I'M QUITE DEMENTED
THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS PRESENT SITUATION WERE HOWEVER APPALLING AND ALMOST DAUNTED HIS SEMI-DIABOLICAL ENERGIES
IT WAS A CONSIDERABLE STAKE TO PLAY FOR AND WELL WORTH A TRIFLING RISK
BUT I WON'T LET ALL GO
WE CERTAINLY ARE MUCH PLEASANTER IN THIS ROOM DORKIE MORE IN PROPORTION THAN WE TWO SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE DRAWING-ROOM HE SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HER DRAWING HIS CHAIR VERY CLOSE TO HERS AND TAKING HER HAND IN HIS
I MAY MENTION I SUPPOSE THAT I DO SO AT YOUR REQUEST AND LARKIN MADE A NEAT LITTLE ENDORSEMENT TO THAT EFFECT AND HE FELT RELIEVED
THE VICAR'S REVERSION A VERY CHIMERICAL CONTINGENCY HE WOULD BY NO MEANS CONSENT TO SELL
AND EYEING THE YOUNG MAN SHREWDLY THE WHILE TO READ WHAT HE MIGHT OF THE STORY IN HIS FACE
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN RADIE
AND SHE POSITIVELY SEEMED TO DISLIKE HIM
SHE HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO ACQUIESCE IN RACHEL'S ESTIMATE OF STANLEY AND TO FANCY THAT WHATEVER HE DID IT WAS WITH AN UNACKNOWLEDGED PURPOSE
SO SOON AS THE DUST AND ASHES OF RAILWAY TRAVEL WERE REMOVED THE PALE CAPTAIN IN CHANGED ATTIRE SNOWY CAMBRIC AND WITH PERFUMED HAIR AND HANDKERCHIEF PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE DORCAS
IT IS FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS SINCE ANYONE CONNECTED WITH BRANDON CAME FORWARD
PEOPLE WON'T LIKE IT YOU KNOW
BUT IT WAS DELIVERED QUIETLY
HE SAW LAWYER LARKIN AS IT WERE REFLECTED IN THE PLATE-GLASS WITH HIS HOLLOW SMILE AND HUNGRY EYES BEFORE HIM KNOWING MORE THAN HE SHOULD DO PAYING HIM COMPLIMENTS AND PLOTTING HIS RUIN
DELIVER US FROM THE EVIL ONE
NEXT TARTARUS
SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY OH SAID THE VICAR'S WIFE TAKING HER SEAT AND THE INSPECTION AND EXPOSITION BEGAN
HE DID NOT SPEAK WHILE THEY REMAINED IN THE ROOM
BUT FOR A RESIDENT HERE PUTTING ASIDE OTHER FEELINGS--A RESIDENT HOLDING A POSITION--IT WOULD NOT DO I ASSURE YOU
HE DID NOT WISH TO LOSE EITHER
YOU NEVER TOOK ADVICE--YOU NEVER WILL
AFTER DINNER WHEN THE DOWAGER'S PLACE KNEW HER NO MORE LORD CHELFORD RESUMED HIS TALK WITH LARKIN
BUT BEING IN SOME MATTERS OF A NERVOUS AND IMPATIENT TEMPERAMENT HE HAD COME AGAIN AS WE SEE HOPING TO FIND JIM THERE AND TO ANTICIPATE HIS INTERVIEW OF THE MORNING
I MUST GO IN FOR IT IT IS LIFE OR DEATH
DORCAS DARLING I WISH I COULD TELL YOU EVERYTHING
SHE IS EITHER A FOOL OR A VERY GREAT PHILOSOPHER AND THERE IS SOMETHING GRAND IN THE SERENE OBSCURITY THAT ENVELOPES HER AND RACHEL LAUGHED A VERY LITTLE
THANK HEAVEN I THINK I MAY TRULY SAY I BEAR ILL-WILL TO NO MAN LIVING
UPON MY HONOUR I QUITE SEE--I NOW ACQUIT YOU
I WANT YOU FOR BEST MAN MAYBE
THEY SAT AT CORNERS DIAGONALLY OPPOSED AND WERE THEREFORE AS FAR APART AS WAS PRACTICABLE--AN ARRANGEMENT NOT SOCIABLE TO BE SURE BUT ON THE WHOLE VERY COMFORTABLE AND WHICH NEITHER SEEMED DISPOSED TO DISTURB
IT CAN'T GO BEYOND FIVE HUNDRED OR SAY NINE HUNDRED--EH AT THE OUTSIDE NINE HUNDRED_--SAY DOUBLE AS MANY THOUSAND AND I'M AFRAID YOU'LL BE NEARER THE MARK
YOU WERE ALWAYS A GOOD FELLOW AND I REALLY WANT A HAND HERE CONFOUNDEDLY
WYLDER MIGHT RETURN ANY DAY AND TOM WEALDON WOULD PROBABLY BE ONE OF THE FIRST MEN WHOM HE WOULD SEE
AND I ASSURE YOU SO FAR AS PERSONAL ANNOYANCE OF ANY KIND IS CONCERNED YOU MAY BE PERFECTLY AT EASE
AS YET WE HAD NO SUSPICION WHOSE WAS THE BODY THUS UNEXPECTEDLY DISCOVERED
THE JOINT BUSINESS PROSPERED
YOURS C
AND THE WEATHER SO VERY DELICIOUS
AS HE PASSED THE LITTLE COTTAGE WHERE OLD WIDOW MADDOCK LAY SICK RACHAEL LAKE EMERGED
IT'S NOT REAL
FROM TAMAR'S DESCRIPTION OF IT I CONCLUDE IT WAS A REVOLVER
I'M SORRY I BEGAN HE SAID PETTISHLY
RACHEL SEEMED TO HAVE MADE UP HER MIND TO SUBMIT PASSIVELY TO WHATEVER HE REQUIRED
YOUR UNEXPLAINED ABSENCE LONGER CONTINUED YOU MUST SEE WILL IMPOSE ON ME THE NECESSITY OF OFFERING AN EXPLANATION TO MISS BRANDON'S FRIENDS OF THE RELATIONS UNDER THESE STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH YOU AND SHE ARE TO BE ASSUMED TO STAND
AND AS WE WERE LYING OFF--I FORGET THE CURSED NAME OF IT--HE BEGGED ME TO PUT HIM ASHORE
SO DO I DORCAS SAID RACHEL IN A FIRM LOW WHISPER RETURNING HER LOOK AS DARKLY
BURLINGTON AND SMITH DID NOT CARE TO RUN THE AWFUL RISK WHICH MR LARKIN BEHIND THE SCENES INVITED THEM TO ACCEPT FOR HIS SAKE
HE WOULD MISS HIS TROUBLESOME LITTLE MAN WHEN THE SUN SHONE OUT THAT HE USED TO WELCOME--WHEN THE BIRDS HOPPED ON THE WINDOW-STONE TO FIND THE CRUMBS THAT LITTLE MAN USED TO STREW THERE
THE WYLDERS AND BRANDONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONTESTING THE RIGHT TO THESE ESTATES AND THE SAME THING MAY ARISE AGAIN ANY DAY BUT TELL ME STANLEY HOW DO YOU WANT TO APPLY MONEY
NOW SEE MY DEAR SIR I AM I HUMBLY HOPE A CHRISTIAN MAN
BUT AFTER ALL THERE IS NO PICTURE OF FLOWERS OR STILL LIFE OR EVEN OF LANDSCAPE THAT WILL INTEREST LONG
AND IF HE WON'T I PROMISE YOU HE SHALL LEAVE THE COUNTRY SAID THE YOUNG MAN GENTLY JUST LIFTING HIS YELLOW EYES FOR A SECOND WITH ANOTHER UNPLEASANT GLARE
OF THE SECOND PART AND DORCAS ADDERLEY BRANDON OF BRANDON HALL IN THE COUNTY OF C C
YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ADMINISTERING IT YOURSELF MISS BRANDON
THE HIATUS IN HIS CORRESPONDENCE CAUSED MR LARKIN EXTREME UNEASINESS
MARK WYLDER'S FATE IS DREADFUL AND STANLEY IS THE MOVER OF ALL THIS
NO--NOT HE
YOU ARE THINKING I KNOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN US ONCE OR TWICE TALKING TOGETHER STANLEY PAUSED NOT KNOWING EXACTLY HOW TO CONSTRUCT THE REMAINDER OF HIS SENTENCE
THE FACT IS TO CARRY YOU SAFELY THROUGH YOU WILL NEED PRETTY NEARLY THE UNDIVIDED ATTENTION OF A WELL-QUALIFIED ABLE AND CONFIDENTIAL PRACTITIONER
IT WAS A SMALL HOUSE THIS REDMAN'S FARM BUT VERY SILENT FOR ALL THAT WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS OVER
SO HE TOOK HIS CAP AND LIGHTED HIS CIGAR TOO AND STROLLED A LITTLE WAY WITH THE ATTORNEY
DO GIVE YOUR POOR SOUL THIS ONE CHANCE AND LAKE ANSWERED HIM SUPERCILIOUSLY AND IRREVERENTLY
I'VE DISCOVERED SOMETHING ABOUT HIS LETTERS SAID THE ATTORNEY AND PAUSED
THERE WERE NEW FACES AT THE DOOR
EVERYTHING WORKED TOGETHER HE KNEW
WHAT AILS HER--IS SHE ILL MASTER STANLEY ASKED THE OLD WOMAN RETURNING WITH HER WHITE EYES THE YOUNG MAN'S STRANGE YELLOW GLARE
AND ANYTHING THAT COMES FROM YOU MR LARCOM IS NEVER HEARD IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR NAME BEYOND THESE WALLS
AND YOUR WAY OF LIFE AND YOUR LOOKS--FOR BOTH ARE CHANGED--ARE LIKELY IN A LITTLE PRATING VILLAGE WHERE EVERY HUMAN BEING IS WATCHED AND DISCUSSED INCESSANTLY TO EXCITE CONJECTURE
BUT THERE IS NOTHING WHICH EITHER SHE OR I MAY SAY WHICH I WISH TO CONCEAL FROM ANY FRIEND OF MR WYLDER'S THE IDEA OF MISS BRANDON'S SERIOUSLY THINKING OF WITHDRAWING FROM HER ENGAGEMENT WITH MARK WYLDER I CONFESS NEVER ENTERED MY MIND
NICE MANAGEMENT
BUT WILLIAM WYLDER WAS DIFFERENT
THE BRANDONS--POOH
BUT THOUGH HE SPOKE QUITE MEEKLY THE ATTORNEY LOOKED RATHER BLACK AND HIS CONVERSE GREW SOMEWHAT DRY AND SHORT
AND WHERE IS POOR BILLY QUARTERED NOT QUITE HALF A MILE AWAY
HIS RETURN HE SAYS CANNOT BE DELAYED BEYOND A VERY FEW MONTHS PERHAPS WEEKS AND HE STATES IN HIS OWN ROUGH WAY THAT HE WILL THEN EXPLAIN THE MOTIVES OF HIS CONDUCT TO THE ENTIRE SATISFACTION OF ALL THOSE WHO ARE COGNIZANT OF THE MEASURES WHICH HE HAS ADOPTED--NO MORE CLARET THANKS--NO MORE--A DELICIOUS WINE--AND HE ADDS IT WILL THEN BE QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAS ACTED NEITHER FROM CAPRICE NOR FROM ANY MOTIVE OTHER THAN SELF-PRESERVATION
WHO HAS LIKE KING SOLOMON MADE WISDOM HIS FIRST OBJECT AND WHO FINDS RICHES ADDED THERETO
I AM WEARY OF URGING YOU IN VAIN TO DO SO
HAVE NOT YOU READ OF STRAINING AT GNATS AND SWALLOWING CAMELS
AND WHY THE DEVIL HE CONTINUED IN A CHANGED TONE DO YOU APPLY THOSE INSOLENT TERMS TO WHAT I PURPOSE DOING I WISH I COULD FIND WORDS STRONG ENOUGH TO EXPRESS MY HORROR OF YOUR PLOT--A PLOT EVERY WAY DISGUSTING
IT COMMENCED THUS GENOA
HOW SWIFT TO SHED BLOOD AS POOR WILLIAM WYLDER SAID LAST SUNDAY
WHAT DO YOU LAUGH AT CHARLIE SAID WYLDER GRINNING HIMSELF
YOU WOMEN UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER AND HOW TO GET A FELLOW FAVOURABLY INTO ONE ANOTHER'S THOUGHTS
HOW DO YOU MEAN LARCOM WELL SIR I KNOW YOU WON'T MENTION ME MR LARKIN CERTAINLY NOT--GO ON WHEN PEOPLE GETS HOT A-TALKING THEY WON'T MIND A BODY COMIN IN
BUT I DON'T THINK SO NOR ANY MAN OF SENSE NOR ANYONE BUT A HAIRBRAINED CONCEITED KNIGHT-ERRANT I THINK CHELFORD ONE OF THE MOST SENSIBLE AS WELL AS HONOURABLE MEN I KNOW
CHAPTER XV
THEN WILLIAM WYLDER SHUT THE HALL-DOOR AND TURNED ABOUT
YET I CAN'T SAY
JIM DUTTON SIR
I DREAMED THAT I WAS ARRANGING MY TOILET BEFORE THIS GLASS--JUST AS I HAD DONE THAT EVENING--WHEN ON A SUDDEN THE FACE OF THE PORTRAIT I HAVE MENTIONED WAS PRESENTED ON ITS SURFACE CONFRONTING ME LIKE A REAL COUNTENANCE AND ADVANCING TOWARDS ME WITH A LOOK OF FURY
AND SO VERY LITTLE COURTSHIP HAS SUFFICED
AND THERE WAS A LITTLE SPACE BEFORE THEY HEARD A KNOCK AT THE DOOR OF DORCAS'S PRETTY ROOM AND LORD CHELFORD DULY INVITED CAME IN
FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING--EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING YOU KEEP YOUR SECRET AS USUAL STANLEY SAID THE YOUNG LADY
TAMAR THEY ARE GALLOPING DOWN THE ROAD I THINK--WHAT CAN IT MEAN EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG LADY SCARED SHE COULD NOT TELL WHY
BURLINGTON AND SMITH HE HAD SIMPLY EXPRESSED HIS OWN SURMISES AS TO THE PROBABLE WITHDRAWAL OF THE INTENDING PURCHASER BUT HAD RECEIVED NO FORMAL NOR INDEED ANY AUTHENTIC INFORMATION FROM EITHER THE PARTY OR THE SOLICITORS REFERRED TO TO THAT EFFECT
IT WAS NOT PERFECTLY CLEAR TO THE GENTLEMEN AND LADIES IN CHARGE OF THE ICES CHICKENS AND CHAMPAGNE BETWEEN WHICH OF THE THREE SWELLS WHO HAD JUST LEFT THE ROOM THE QUARREL WAS--IT HAD COME SO SUDDENLY AND WAS OVER SO QUICKLY LIKE A CLAP OF THUNDER
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THE GAY BELLES AND ELDERLY SPINSTERS AND FAT VILLAGE CHAPERONES WERE INVESTED IN SUITABLE COSTUME BY THE APPOINTED HOUR AND IN A FEW WEEKS MISS WILLIAMS MIND RECOVERED ITS WONTED TONE AND HER COUNTENANCE ITS NATURAL EXPRESSION
HE KISSED HER CHEEK AGAIN PLACING ONE ARM ROUND HER SLENDER WAIST AND WITH HIS OTHER HAND TAKING HERS
YOU HAVE BEEN MORE ILL THAN I THOUGHT DARLING AND YOU ARE STILL FAR FROM QUITE RECOVERED RACHEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED EYE STRUCK HER WITH A PAINFUL SURPRISE
THERE ARE THE FORRESTERS I KNOW IT ALL STANLEY
IT WAS A CASE IN WHICH HE CLEARLY SAW HE MUST COMMAND HIMSELF
EVERYONE MUST ASSIST
HOW SHE USED TO PLUCK THE LEAVES FROM THE FLOWERS LIKE FAUST'S MARGUERITE SAYING HE LOVES ME A LITTLE--PASSIONATELY NOT AT ALL NOW IF I WERE LOVED PASSIONATELY I MIGHT LOVE A LITTLE
MISS BEAUCHAMP
THEN HE DROPPED INTO THE BRANDON ARMS AND HAD A GLASS OF BRANDY AND WATER AND A NEWSPAPER IN THE COFFEE-ROOM
AND IT IS THE MORE PROVOKING BECAUSE I LOVE YOU SO
THE GAMEKEEPERS THE FIFTY HAY-MAKERS IN THE GREAT MEADOW THEY WERE TO ENTER THE TOWN FROM THE TOP OF CHURCH STREET WHERE THEY WERE TO GATHER ALL THE BOYS AND BLACKGUARDS THEY COULD
HIS YELLOW EYES FOR A MOMENT GLEAMED INTO HERS AND THEN ON THE VICAR AND WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED SMILE HE EXTENDED HIS HAND
DEEP AND SHALLOW
STANLEY LAKE'S POSITION IF ALL WERE KNOWN WAS AT THIS MOMENT FORMIDABLE ENOUGH
I OUGHT TO HAVE REJOICED--BUT WE DON'T ALWAYS SEE WHAT MOST CONCERNS OUR PEACE
NOW IT WAS NOT QUITE CLEAR WHAT WAS RIGHT--BY WHICH THE GOOD ATTORNEY MEANT PRUDENT--UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
YOU MEAN HE SAID LOOKING UP FOR A MOMENT WITH A SUDDEN STARE SHE HAS GOT MONEY
BURLINGTON AND SMITH ANYTHING BUT SATISFIED WITH HIM--THE VICAR
I HOPE YOU ARE NOT VERY TIRED DARLING
YOU'RE TALKING LIKE A MANIAC
AT LAST SHE PLACED THE PICTURE IN MY HAND AND ASKED IS THIS REALLY VERY LIKE HER IT IS AND IT IS NOT I SAID AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
THAT REVERSION
SHE IS A SUPERBLY FINE GIRL
AND NEXT THEY PULLED UP AT THAT OFFICIAL RENDEZVOUS WITH WHITE-WASHED FRONT--AND POST-OFFICE IN WHITE LETTERS ON A BROWN BOARD OVER ITS DOOR AND ITS BLACK HINGED WINDOW-PANE THROUGH WHICH MR DRIVER--OR IN HIS ABSENCE MISS ANNE DRIVER--ANSWERED QUESTIONS AND TRANSACTED AFFAIRS OFFICIALLY
MY LITTLE MAN FAIRY GLANCED STILL SMILING BUT VERY SHAMEFACEDLY AT THE GRAND ATTORNEY AND IN HIS LITTLE FIST HE HELD A PAIR OF RATHER SEEDY GLOVES TO THE WINDOW PANE
BUT THAT DELUSION WAS QUITE CURED NOW--NO RESERVE OR DOUBT OR COLDNESS LEFT BEHIND
IT IS STRANGE SO REASONABLE A QUESTION FROM A WIFE SHOULD SCARE YOUR SISTER FROM THE ROOM I DON'T QUITE SEE THAT--FOR MY PART I DON'T THINK ANYTHING STRANGE IN A WOMAN
MY COURAGE I THINK IS GONE
THE MAN SIR AS YOU LEFT A NOTE FOR YESTERDAY WHICH HE DESIRES TO SEE YOU TELL HIM TO STEP IN SO OUT WENT THE WAITER IN PUMPS AND THE SOUND OF THICK SHOES WAS AUDIBLE ON THE LOBBY AND A STURDIER KNOCK SOUNDED ON THE DOOR
WHEN I KNEW IT THERE WERE BUT THREE SINGLE MEN ACCORDING EVEN TO THE MODEST MEASURE OF GYLINGDEN HOUSEKEEPING CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING WIVES AND THESE WERE DIFFICULT TO PLEASE SET A HIGH PRICE ON THEMSELVES--LOOKED THE COUNTRY ROUND AT LONG RANGES AND WERE ONLY WISTFULLY AND MEEKLY GLANCED AFTER BY THE FRUGAL VESTALS OF GYLINGDEN AS THEY STRUTTED ROUND THE CORNERS OR SMOKED THE PIPE OF APATHY AT THE READING-ROOM WINDOWS
THE VICAR HIS BROTHER HAD A PROMISE OF MONEY FROM HIM AND IS DISAPPOINTED--IN VERY GREAT EMBARRASSMENTS
AND THERE WAS GROWING IN DORCAS'S MIND A FEELING TOWARDS RACHEL WHICH HER PRIDE FORBADE HER TO DEFINE
WHY HA HA
HANDSOME BUT SO NOISY AND FOOLISH AND WICKED
AND SO THE ROOM ON THE LEVEL MY LORD WOULD PERHAPS BE MORE CONVENIENT CERTAINLY
AND LAKE WHO AS WE KNOW HAD JUST SEEN HIS SISTER GAVE HIM ALL PARTICULARS
NOT SO WELL--GONE TO BED--BUT WOULD BE BETTER EVERYONE WAS SURE IN THE MORNING SO HE WENT IN AND SAW THE VICAR WHO HAD JUST RETURNED WITH DOLLY FROM A LITTLE RAMBLE
AND LETTING THE THIN OPEN LETTER FALL OR RATHER THROWING IT WITH A SLIGHT WHISK UPON THE TABLE
AND THEN SHE REVISITED THE KITCHEN BUT THAT WAS EMPTY TOO AND THE FIRE TAKEN DOWN
THAT'S A DEVILISH FINE GIRL SAID MARK WYLDER
QUITE WELL I TRUST
WHERE HAVE YOU LEFT HIM UP THERE AT THE PATHWAY NEAR THE STONE STEPS WAITING THERE WELL YES
HE WAS A TALL LANK MAN--RATHER LONG OF LIMB LONG OF HEAD AND GAUNT OF FACE
RACHEL WAS TROUBLED BY A SORT OF FEAR TO-NIGHT AND THE LOW FEVER OF AN UNDEFINED EXPECTATION WAS UPON HER
LARKIN WAS FOUND TO HAVE TAKEN BUT AN ESTATE FOR THE LIFE OF MARK WYLDER WHICH TERMINATED AT HIS DECEASE
HE WAS FURNISHED WITH AN EXCELLENT CHARACTER--HIS CHEQUES WERE ALWAYS HONOURED--HIS TOTS ALWAYS UNEXCEPTIONABLE--HIS VOUCHERS NEVER ANYTHING BUT EXACT
BUT I AM MAKING UP MY MIND TO A GREAT AND BOLD STEP AND WHEN I AM BETTER ABLE I WILL TALK IT OVER WITH YOU--MY ONLY FRIEND RACHEL AND SHE KISSED HER
I'M SO GLAD HE'S AWAY--THE CLUMSIEST DOG IN ENGLAND--NOTHING CLEVER--NO INVENTION--ONLY A BULLY--THE PEOPLE HATE HIM
YOU ARE QUITE UNREASONABLE
THE BODY DIES AND THE LORD OF LIFE COMPARES IT TO THE DEATH OF THE SEED IN THE EARTH
I'D SAY WITH A COURTESY--"THINK NOT PRINCE THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A CAT AND THAT MY BIRTH IS OBSCURE
THAT SCOUNDREL LARCOM KNEW PERFECTLY IT WAS MEANT FOR ME
SO WYLDER LAKE AND JOS
THE FACT IS MISS LAKE THAT THAT IS AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES I COULD NOT THINK OF ADVISING
HE DROPPED YOU BECAUSE YOU DROPPED HIM
CHAPTER LII
THERE WAS AN AIR OF IMMOVABLE RESOLUTION IN THE FEW WORDS WHICH DORCAS HAD SPOKEN WHICH RATHER TOOK HIM BY SURPRISE
IT WAS WONDERFUL HOW THAT FAIR YOUNG FACE COULD LOOK SO TERRIBLE
BUT SHE OWNED FOR HER PART SHE PREFERRED THE OLD FASHION AND THOUGHT THE MEN DID ALSO
WHO I ASKED
SHE LOOKED ON ME FOR A SECOND OR TWO WITH HER DARK DROWSY GLANCE AND THEN IT RETURNED TO THE PICTURE WHICH WAS AGAIN IN HER HAND
WHEN SHE RETURNED SHE WAS A LITTLE TIRED AND DOUBTFUL WHETHER SHE WOULD DANCE ANY MORE--CERTAINLY NOT THE NEXT DANCE
AND VERY BLUE UNDER THE EYES WHICH SHOWED A GREAT DEAL OF THEIR WATERY WHITES
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SIR DEMANDED LAKE IN HIS MOST UNPLEASANT TONES
I'VE HALF A MIND CHARLIE TO TELL YOU A THING
THE ODIOUS SPECTACLE OCCUPIED HIM FOR SOME MINUTES
A CHAIR BETWEEN LAKE AND SIR HARRY IMPEDED THE BARONET'S STRIDE AND HIS UPLIFTED ARM WAS CAUGHT BY A GENTLEMAN IN MOUSTACHE WHO HELD SO FAST THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF SHAKING IT LOOSE
SO THEY FELL INTO DISCOURSE AMONG THE AUTUMNAL FLOWERS AND WITHERED LEAVES
AND I WISH SHE SIGHED SOFTLY I WISH WE WERE AS WE USED TO BE
AND OVER THIS TEMPERATE BEVERAGE I TOLD HIM FRANKLY THE NATURE OF THE SERVICE WHICH MARK WYLDER WISHED ME TO RENDER HIM
AND WE OWE HIM THAT RESPECT STANLEY HE HAS BEEN SO VERY KIND TO US CHELFORD IS THE VERY LAST MAN WHOM I WOULD THINK OF CONSULTING ANSWERED STANLEY WITH HIS MALIGN AND PEEVISH LOOK
HE HAS FRIGHTENED YOU SAID RACHEL HERSELF FRIGHTENED
SO HE GLIDED BY OLD LADY CHELFORD WHO WAS DOZING STIFFLY THROUGH HER SPECTACLES ON A FRENCH NOVEL AND THROUGH A SECOND DRAWING-ROOM AND INTO THE HALL WHERE HE SAW LARCOM'S EXPANSIVE WHITE WAISTCOAT AND DISREGARDED HIS ADVANCE AND RESPECTFUL INCLINATION AND STRODE INTO THE OUTER HALL OR VESTIBULE WHERE WERE HAT-STANDS WALKING-STICKS GREAT COATS UMBRELLAS AND THE EXUVIAE OF GENTLEMEN
HOW BASE
WE CAN'T BE OVERHEARD IT IS SO LARGE
HERE WAS OBVIOUSLY RESENTED A CHANCE OF OBTAINING THE COMMAND OF A SECRET OF GREATER OR LESS IMPORTANCE
BUT STILL WITH AN UNPLEASANT ASSOCIATION ABOUT IT
WE LIVE IN SOLITUDE AND PRIVATIONS--THE WORLD HATES US--THEY STONE US--THEY CUT US ASUNDER EVEN WHEN WE ARE DEAD
AND AT ANY TIME I THINK RACHEL IN A LIKE SOLITUDE AND DARKNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO SEE THE RED GLIMMER OF OLD TAMAR'S CANDLE PROCLAIMING UNDER THE BRANCHES THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF HUMAN LIFE AND SYMPATHY
BILLIARDS I ASSURE YOU
THAT IS YOU WON'T UNTIL YOU HAVE SAID WHAT YOU MEDITATE
LARKIN OF THE LODGE ESQ MASTER OF FIVE OAKS WAS SAFELY LOCKED INTO THE BOX UNDER HIS LONG ARM AND THE ATTORNEY VANISHED BOWING VERY MUCH AND CONCEALING HIS ELATION UNDER A SOLEMN SORT OF NONCHALANCE
NO MAN EVER FAILED BUT THROUGH HIS OWN FAULT--NONE EVER SUCCEEDED BUT BY HIS DESERVINGS
MY FATHER WAS KING OF SIX KINGDOMS AND LOVED MY MOTHER TENDERLY AND SO FORTH RACHEL I LIKE YOU INTERRUPTED THE DARK BEAUTY FIXING HER LARGE EYES FROM WHICH NOT LIGHT BUT AS IT WERE A RICH SHADOW FELL SOFTLY ON HER COMPANION
COME NOW DORKIE BE A GOOD GIRL--YOU MUST NOT LOOK SO VEXED I'M NOT VEXED WHAT THEN I'M ONLY THINKING SHE SAID THIS WITH THE SAME BITTER SMILE
AND THE LANK ATTORNEY WITH TALL BALD HEAD SHADED FACE AND HUNGRY DANGEROUS EYES A PRIEST OR A MAGICIAN
MRS WOOLASTON SHE IS SUCH A KIND SOUL LENT HIM SUCH A BEAUTIFUL OLD PICTURE BOOK--"WOODWARD'S ECCENTRICITIES IT IS CALLED--AND HE'S QUITE HAPPY--LITTLE FAIRY ON HIS LITTLE STOOL AT THE WINDOW NO HEADACHE OR FEVER ASKED MISS LAKE CHEERFULLY THOUGH SHE KNEW NOT WHY THERE SEEMED SOMETHING OMINOUS IN THIS LITTLE AILMENT
SO MARK WAITED TO PUT THE LADY INTO THE CARRIAGE AND HE MEDITATED WALKING A LITTLE WAY BY THE WINDOW AND MAKING HIS PEACE AND THERE WAS PERHAPS SOME VAGUE VISION OF JUMPING IN AFTERWARDS
THE SAME EARTH FOR THE DEAD GREAT AND SMALL
SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL MUFFLED UP AND LOOKED VERY PALE AND ASKED WHETHER MISS BRANDON WAS IN HER ROOM WHITHER SHE GLIDED RAPIDLY UP STAIRS
VERY WELL DARLING WE'LL LEAVE IT SO DOLLY DARLING YOU AND NURSE MUST BE SO TIRED SITTING UP
NO NOT PLEASANT--AND I'VE QUITE MADE UP MY MIND IT SHA'N'T GO ON
I'M DEVILISH UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THIS GRAND MATCH
THE OLD PARK OF BRANDON LIES THERE MORE THAN FOUR MILES FROM END TO END
WHAT WAS THIS SECRET
HE MUST NOT THINK OF IT AND UP STARTED RACHEL AND BEFORE DOLLY COULD INTERPOSE OR REMONSTRATE SHE HAD CROSSED THE LITTLE HALL AND ENTERED THE HOMELY STUDY WHERE THE GENTLEMEN WERE CONFERRING
A RIDICULOUS FAILURE AMUSED HIM NEARLY AS MUCH
AFTER A WHILE HE TOOK HIS CRUMPLED LETTER FROM HIS POCKET UNFOLDED AND SMOOTHED IT AND WROTE UPON A BLANK HALF-PAGE RESPECTED SIR,--SINCE THE ABOVE I AVE A MUCH TO TEL MOS SURPRISEN THE GENTLEMAN YOU WER ANCEOUS OF TIDING MISTER M
THE TEETH SO WHITE AND EVEN
THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON VERY STRONGLY THOUGH DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED BY THE NEWS
AND I MUST SAY ONCE FOR ALL SIR THAT--QUITE SETTING ASIDE EVERY CONSIDERATION OF HONOUR AND OF CONSCIENCE AND OF THE HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL POSITION IN WHICH YOU WOULD PLACE ME AS A MAN OF BUSINESS BY TAKING THE VERY SHORT TURN WHICH THIS YOUNG LADY MISS LAKE SUGGESTS--YOUR LETTERS AMOUNT TO AN EQUITABLE AGREEMENT TO SELL WHICH ON PETITION THE COURT WOULD COMPEL YOU TO DO SO YOU SEE MY DEAR MISS LAKE THERE IS NO MORE TO BE SAID SAID THE VICAR WITH A CAREWORN SMILE LOOKING UPON RACHEL'S HANDSOME FACE
YOUR LITTLE BOY MUST NOT BE RUINED BUT--BUT I DO ASSURE YOU I HAVE SO PLEDGED MYSELF BY THE LETTER I HAVE MENTIONED THAT I COULD NOT--NO IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE HE ADDED AS HE RECOLLECTED THE STRONG AND POINTED TERMS IN WHICH HE HAD PLEDGED HIS HONOUR AND CONSCIENCE TO THE LONDON FIRM TO GUARANTEE THEM AGAINST ANY SUCH DISTURBANCE AS MISS LAKE WAS URGING HIM TO ATTEMPT
AND SUCH INCONCEIVABLE MEANNESS CANNOT ENTER YOUR MIND THE ATTORNEY WITH WHAT HE MEANT TO BE A POLISHED SARCASM BOWED AND SMILED TOWARD MISS LAKE
ON THE STEPS OF THE READING-ROOM STOOD OLD TOM RUDDLE WHO ACTED AS MARKER IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM TREASURER AND BOOK-KEEPER BESIDE AND SWEPT OUT THE PREMISES EVERY MORNING AND WENT TO AND FRO AT THE PROPER HOURS BETWEEN THAT LITERARY AND SPORTING INSTITUTION AND THE POST-OFFICE
THEY TELL YOU
HE FELT QUITE GRATEFUL TO THEM IN HIS PRIGGISH WAY--THEIR MANAGEMENT IN THIS MATTER HAD BEEN SO EMINENTLY SATISFACTORY
DORCAS HAD URGED HER EARNESTLY TO GIVE UP REDMAN'S FARM AND TAKE UP HER ABODE PERMANENTLY AT BRANDON
ABOUT YOUR DANGER SHE ANSWERED
AND SHE AND STANLEY SIDE BY SIDE WALKED ON TOWARD REDMAN'S DELL
WHAT SHALL I SAY
THERE WAS JUST A SECOND IN WHICH THE ATHLETIC BARONET STOOD AS IT WERE BREATHLESS AND INCREDULOUS AND THEN HIS HERCULEAN FIST WHIRLED IN THE AIR WITH A MOST UNSEEMLY OATH
AS IT IS WRITTEN HE THAT HAD GATHERED MUCH HAD NOTHING OVER
YOU MUST COME TOO--YOU MUST RADIE OH STANLEY STANLEY STANLEY WHY D IT IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW
BUT LISTEN NO MORE TO OTHER PEOPLE'S CONVERSATION
RACHEL TREATED HIM WITH A SORT OF DEFERENCE A LITTLE CONTEMPTUOUS PERHAPS SUCH AS SPOILED CHILDREN RECEIVE FROM INDULGENT ELDERS
THEY HAD MANY FAULTS BUT THEY WERE NOT STICKS OR STONES
YOU MUST NOT KEEP HER SHE'S OF NO EARTHLY USE POOR OLD THING
YOU DON'T KNOW YET HOW I AM DODGING OR WHY MY MEASURES ARE TAKEN
WHO WAS THERE TO CALL AT SO ODD AN HOUR
SO THE VICAR MADE HIS ADIEUX THERE AND BEGAN AT A BRISKER PACE TO RETRACE HIS STEPS TOWARD GYLINGDEN
WHO IS THE TALL MAN WITH THE LONG PALE FACE AND WILD PHOSPHORIC EYES
I FORGOT MY PROMISE ABOUT MARK WYLDER
MR LARKIN EYED THE WYLDER CORRESPONDENCE NOW WITH A SORT OF REVERENCE THAT WAS NEW TO HIM
AND WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE HIM FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES IF HE COULD SPARE TIME
NEARLY TWO HOURS HAD PASSED BEFORE THEY RETURNED
BRACTON'S OUTRAGE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ENTIRE THING--AND SO HELP HIM HEAVEN SO SOON AS HE SHOULD BE ON HIS LEGS AGAIN HE WOULD MAKE HIM FEEL IT ONE WAY OR OTHER
IT WAS LATE NOW NOT FAR FROM ONE O'CLOCK AND AROUND HER THE TERRIBLE SILENCE OF A STILL NIGHT
RACHEL LAKE WAS COURAGEOUS AND ENERGETIC
TO ME THE NATURAL DEMISE OF A TETE-A-TETE DISCOURSE HAS ALWAYS SEEMED A DISGRACE
SECRET THEN IF YOU WILL HAVE IT SO RETORTED STANLEY SUDDENLY WITH ONE OF THOSE GLARES THAT LASTED FOR JUST ONE FELL MOMENT
THERE IS A COMFORTER AND THERE IS A CHASTENER
THE TRUSTEES OF WYLDER A MINOR TRIED AS THEY WERE ADVISED THEY MUST HIS TITLE TO FIVE OAKS BY EJECTMENT
BUT PEERS DID NOT IN THE LEAST OVERAWE STANLEY LAKE WHO HAD BEEN ALL HIS DAYS FAMILIAR WITH THOSE IDOLS
I HAVE RECEIVED THOSE LETTERS CAPTAIN LAKE OF WHICH I SPOKE TO YOU WHEN I LAST HAD THE HONOUR OF SEEING YOU AS FURNISHING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THEM GRAVE MATTER OF SUSPICION SINCE WHEN I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ONE WITH MR WYLDER'S SIGNATURE
BUT WHAT THE DEVIL BRINGS YOU HERE HE SAID
THERE ARE MANY OF COURSE VERY DESIRABLE GENTLEMEN BUT I FEEL IT MY DEAR SIR A VERY SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITY NAMING ONE FOR SO PECULIAR A MATTER
HE THRUST THE UNFOLDED LETTER ROUGHLY INTO THE VERY DEPTHS OF HIS BREECHES POCKET AND BLEW OUT BOTH CANDLES
HER ALARMS QUICKLY SUBSIDED HOWEVER FOR SHE KNEW THE VOICE WELL
AND THAT FOR SOME SPIRITS THE ONLY APPROACH TO THE THRONE OF MERCY WAS THROUGH GREAT TRIBULATION
THAT IS RIGHT THE MAID DUCKED A SHORT COURTESY
MARK WYLDER IS DOWN HERE AND HE HAS GOT AN ESTATE AND A HOUSE AND IT IS TIME HE SHOULD MARRY YOU MARK WYLDER IS HERE TO MARRY MY COUSIN DORCAS
YOU MUST NOT LOSE YOUR WALK THEN YOU WON'T COME INTO THE HOUSE YOU WON'T DRINK TEA WITH ME AND YOU WON'T JOIN ME IN MY LITTLE WALK
WILLIAM WYLDER WERE DARKENED AND AGITATED
THERE WAS A TOTAL WANT OF INTEREST IN THE CARELESS SORT OF SURPRISE SHE VOUCHSAFED MY LITTLE SALLY
LARKIN ALONE FOR THAT
BUT GENERALS MUST SLEEP LIKE OTHER MEN
I DON'T THINK YOU QUITE KNOW ME
HOW IS POOR OLD MRS MADDOCK HE ASKED
A HAND I ECHOED
HERE IT IS PLAIN THERE WAS A SLIP IN POSTING THE WRONG ONE FIRST TREPANNED KIDNAPPED HID AWAY IN THE CRYPTS OF SOME REMOTE MAD-HOUSE--REDUCED TO SUBMISSION BY PRIVATION AND MISERY--A CASE AS DESPERATE AS THAT OF A PRISONER IN THE INQUISITION
CHAPTER VIII
IT WAS THE LAWYER MR LARKIN ENTERED THE VICAR'S STUDY WHERE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BUSY ABOUT HIS SERMON
AND A WICKED SERAPH RECEIVED HIM AND BLESSED HIM TILL HIS HAIR STOOD UP
RACHEL LAKE RANG HER BELL SHARPLY AND OLD TAMAR APPEARED
BUT OUR DEAR MR SPECTATOR TELLS US SOMEWHERE THAT HE LAUGHED EASILY WHICH I THINK QUITE ACCOUNTS FOR HIS ACCEPTANCE WITH THE CLUB
I CAME DOWN HERE TO MARRY HER
BUT THERE IS THIS IN YOU THAT RESEMBLES ME--WE BOTH HATE HYPOCRISY AND WE ARE BOTH IN OUR OWN WAYS PROUD
LADY MACBETH
A COLD BREATH OF HORROR CREPT FROM HIS BRAIN TO HIS HEEL AS HE TURNED ABOUT AND SAW THE LARGE BLANCHED FEATURES AND GLASSY EYES OF UNCLE LORNE BENT OVER HIM
SHE WAS FAINTED OUTRIGHT IN HER CHAIR IN THE DUTCH ROOM
STOWER WENT UP THE DAY BEFORE
BUT THOUGH THE GOOD FOLK OF GYLINGDEN IN GENERAL CARED VERY LITTLE HOW MARK WYLDER MIGHT HAVE DISPOSED OF HIMSELF THERE WAS ONE INHABITANT TO WHOM HIS ABSENCE WAS FRAUGHT WITH VERY SERIOUS ANXIETY AND INCONVENIENCE
WITH THE EDGE OF HIS NETHER LIP NIPPED IN HIS TEETH AND HIS CLENCHED HANDS IN HIS POCKETS HE WALKED THROUGH THE FOREST TREES TO THE PARK AND IN HIS SOLITUDES HURRIED ONWARD AS IF HIS LIFE DEPENDED ON HIS SPEED
AND THOUGH I DON'T THINK WE COULD EITHER GIVE A REASON--I DON'T KNOW DOLLY BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO TRUST HIM BUT MY DEAR HE IS AN EXCELLENT MAN AND SUCH A FRIEND AND HE HAS MANAGED ALL THIS MOST TROUBLESOME BUSINESS SO DELIGHTFULLY
NO LIFE LIKE A GARDENER'S--EARLY HOURS WORK AIR AND PLENTY OF QUIET AND THE YOUNG LADY LAUGHED
AND IN THAT CASE IT WILL BE EVERY THING THAT THE DEEDS SHOULD BE EXECUTED AND THE PURCHASE COMPLETED BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THIS PERSON AND THE PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF MARK WYLDER'S DEATH
IN THE MEANTIME YOU MUST NOT PLAGUE POOR MISS RADIE WITH YOUR NONSENSE
LORD CHELFORD READ I ASK NOT I KNOW NOT IF GUILT'S IN THY HEART I BUT KNOW THAT I LOVE THEE WHATEVER THOU ART HE LAUGHED
THE OFFER SAID THE ATTORNEY BEGINNING RATHER ABRUPTLY IS NO DOUBT A HANDSOME OFFER AT THE FIRST GLANCE AND IT MAY BE WELL MEANT
IT IS NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF DEBT--PLENTY OF MONEY
IT WAS PLAIN THAT STANLEY LAKE'S CANVASS WAS PRETTY WELL OVER
I_'M AS MUCH SURPRISED AS HE
BUT THERE'S NO HURRY
BUT THERE SHE WAS--HE COULD NOT PASS HER BY
THE EARLY SPRING WAS ALREADY SHOWING ITS BRIGHT GREEN THROUGH THE BROWN OF WINTER AND SUN AND SHOWER ALTERNATING AND THE GAY GOSSIPING OF SWEET BIRDS AMONG THE BRANCHES WERE CALLING THE YOUNG CREATION FROM ITS SLUMBERS
AT GYLINGDEN AND BRANDON HE HAD BEEN SIMULATING CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE--BEING IN TRUTH SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT--WITH A VIGILANT HISTRIONIC EFFORT WHICH WAS AWFULLY EXHAUSTING AND SOMETIMES NEARLY INTOLERABLE
SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND THEN AWAY TOWARD THE DECLINING SUN AND SHE SAID DESPAIRINGLY I CANNOT COMPREHEND YOU COME SAID HE MISS LAKE BETHINK YOU
IT WAS PARTLY A MYSTIFICATION ABOUT THE ELECTION
YOU'LL BE VERY QUIET--SHE SUSPECTS NOTHING
WE HAD TO GET ALONG A DIM OAK-PANELLED PASSAGE AND INTO A SORT OF OEIL-DE-BOEUF WITH A LANTERN LIGHT ABOVE FROM WHICH DIVERGED TWO OTHER SOLEMN CORRIDORS AND A SHORT PUZZLING TURN OR TWO BROUGHT US TO THE HEAD OF THE UPPER STAIRS
OH DON'T--_PRAY DON'T MENTION IT
WYLDER NO
NOW WILLIE DARLING YOU MUST NOT GO TILL YOU HAVE HAD YOUR BREAKFAST--YOU WILL MAKE YOURSELF ILL--INDEED YOU WILL--DO COME BACK JUST TO PLEASE ME AND EAT A LITTLE FIRST NO DARLING
THE PORTION OF IT WHICH THE CARPET DID NOT COVER SHOWED IT TO BE OAK DARK AND RUGGED
IT IS A COPY OF THIS WHICH IN VERY SPLENDID COLOURING FILLS THE WINDOW THAT LIGHTS THE BRANDON STATE SEAT IN THE CHAPEL
I DID NOT KNOW OR EVEN SUSPECT THAT A HOSTILE MEETING BETWEEN POOR LAKE AND BRACTON WAS THOUGHT OF
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THE UPROAR WHIRLS UP IN A CRESCENDO TO A PITCH AND VOLUME PERFECTLY AMAZING
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE THING I USED TO LOOK AT THEM WITH A FEELING OF MELANCHOLY AND MYSTERY
BY JOVE
WE WERE BOTH PEERING AT IT HAVING DRAWN NEAR STOOPING AND HESITATING AS MEN DO IN A CURIOUS HORROR
YOU SAY YOU THINK YOU ARE DYING
IN NEITHER DRAFT DID JOS
DRY AND VERY HOT THEY WERE--AND LITTLE MAN BABBLING HIS NONSENSE ABOUT LITTLE BOYS AND HIS WAPSIE AND TOYS AND BIRDS AND THE MILL-STREAM AND THE CHURCH-YARD--OF WHICH WITH SO STRANGE A FATALITY CHILDREN NOT IN ROMANCE ONLY BUT REALITY SO OFTEN PRATTLE IN THEIR FEVERISH WANDERINGS
THE SHADOWS AND MISTS OF REDMAN'S DELL ANTICIPATED NIGHT AND IT WAS ALREADY DEEP TWILIGHT THERE
HE HAD LODGINGS SOMEWHERE NEAR RICHMOND AS HOWARD LARKIN ESQ AND IS STILL A RELIGIOUS CHARACTER
TO SPEAK FRANKLY SAID THE POOR VICAR WITH THAT HECTIC IN HIS CHEEK THAT CAME WITH AGITATION I NEVER FANCIED THAT MY REVERSIONARY INTEREST COULD BE SALEABLE NEITHER IS IT IN ALL PROBABILITY ANSWERED THE ATTORNEY
BUT THIS WAS A DECIDEDLY VILLAINOUS SCRAWL--IN FACT IT WAS WRITTEN AS A SELF-EDUCATED BUTCHER MIGHT PEN A BILL
SHE IS CLEVER SHE IS GENEROUS AND HAS MANY NOBLE QUALITIES
LORD CHELFORD WHO KNEW ALL SAYS THAT SHE ACTED NOBLY NOW JOSEPH BEING A JUST MAN WAS MINDED TO PUT HER AWAY PRIVILY THE LAW BEING WHAT
LAKE'S LATE SMOKING WITH WYLDER MUST HAVE DISAGREED WITH HIM VERY MUCH INDEED FOR HE SEEMED MORE OUT OF SORTS AS NIGHT APPROACHED
GIVE UP EVERY IDEA OF IT THIS MOMENT
BUT LIVING IN A SMALL OLD HOUSE IN A DARK GLEN WITH NO COMPANION AND LITTLE TO OCCUPY HER IT WAS DIFFERENT
BUT SHE WAS LOOKING JUST AS BEFORE AT THE MINIATURE AS IT SEEMED TO ME IN FANCY INFUSING SOME OF THE SPIRIT I HAD DESCRIBED INTO THE ARTIST'S RECORD AND SHE SAID ONLY IN SOLILOQUY AS IT WERE YES I SEE--I THINK I SEE SO THERE WAS A PAUSE
IT WAS WITH A SURE PRESCIENCE THAT MARK WYLDER'S LETTER HAD INFERRED THAT STANLEY LAKE WOULD ASPIRE TO THE REPRESENTATION EITHER OF THE COUNTY OR OF THE BOROUGH OF DOLLINGTON
YOU'RE A VERY ODD GIRL--WHY WON'T YOU BELIEVE ME MISS RACHEL ONLY GLANCED ACROSS HER MUFFLERS ON HIS FACE
I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM TO-DAY SAID DORCAS
I NEED ONLY BRING POOR OLD TAMAR WITH ME AND I CAN GIVE UP REDMAN'S FARM IN SEPTEMBER NEXT
HOW OFTEN I WISH IT
DO MAKE RACHEL EXPLAIN HERSELF IF SHE CAN--_I HAVE NO OBJECTION I ASSURE YOU
I WILL THANK YOU TO APPRISE HIM THAT I MEAN TO TAKE MY CHOICE FIRST
SO GLAD I MET YOU AND THEY EDGED INTO A LITTLE NOOK OF THE LOBBY WHERE THEY HAD A FEW MINUTES CONFIDENTIAL TALK DURING WHICH THE MAJOR LOOKED GRAVE AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND CARRIED HIS HEAD HIGH NODDING NOW AND THEN WITH MILITARY DECISION
BUT FAINT AS THE OUTLINE WAS SHE SAW SHE FANCIED THAT IT WAS A TALLER PERSON THAN HE
WELL IT WILL BE NO HARM TO BE READY
WELL HE IS A RUM ONE
AT ALL EVENTS I THINK YOU'LL PITY ME AND AT LAST UNDERSTAND YOUR MISERABLE COUSIN I SAID BEFORE RACHEL THAT I LIKED YOU
WHAT A GENIUS THEY HAVE FOR TEASING
BUT THE SUM OFFERED IS MUCH TOO SMALL AND THE AMOUNT OF COSTS AND OTHER DRAWBACKS UTTERLY MONSTROUS AND THE RESULT IS AFTER DEDUCTING ALL THESE CLAIMS INCLUDING YOUR COSTS MR LARKIN HERE MR LARKIN THREW UP HIS CHIN A LITTLE SMILING AND WAVING HIS LONG HAND AND SAYING OH
YOU HAVE NOT EVEN SUGGESTED A POSTPONEMENT OF THE DAY FIXED FOR THE COMPLETION OF YOUR ENGAGEMENT TO THAT YOUNG LADY
AND HAS HIS MEASURES AND HIS PALLIATIVES READY FOR EACH SUCCESSIVE PHASE OF SICKNESS AND RECOVERY
COULD THIS BE THE HEROINE OF THE PENDING ALLIANCE
HE HAD NO FANCY TO BE WORRIED WHEN HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND BY PROSY REMONSTRANCES
THE SHOP-KEEPERS WERE SHUTTING THEIR WINDOWS
BEING AT LENGTH MADE VICAR OF HUDDELSTON AND MASTER OF CHURCH REVENUES TO THE AMOUNT OF THREE HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR--HAD AT FORTY-FIVE MARRIED HIS EARLY LOVE NOW FORTY-TWO
THE VICAR THINKING OF OTHER THINGS NEVER SEEING THE REPROACHFUL IRONY IN ALL THIS WOULD TAKE IT QUITE LITERALLY ASSENT SADLY AND WITH LITTLE FAIRY BY THE HAND SET FORTH FOR REDMAN'S FARM
BUT HEARING THIS HE WALKED HOME AND REPLACED THE DRESS-COAT AND SILK STOCKINGS HE HAD VENTURED TO REMOVE PROMPTLY IN HIS VALISE WHICH HE BUCKLED DOWN AND LOCKED--SWALLOWED WITH AGITATED VORACITY SOME FRAGMENTS OF BREAKFAST--GOT ON HIS EASY BOOTS AND GAITERS--BRUSHED HIS BEST HAT AND LOCKED IT INTO ITS LEATHER CASE--PLACED HIS RUG GREAT-COAT AND UMBRELLA AND A ROUGH WALKING-STICK FOR SERVICE AND A GOLD-TIPPED EXQUISITE CANE FOR DUTY ON PROMENADES OF FASHION NEATLY ON TOP OF HIS VALISE AND WITH HIS OLD WHITE HAT AND SHOOTING-COAT ON LOOKING AND WHISTLING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AS USUAL HE POPPED CARELESSLY INTO JOHN HOBBS'S STABLE WHERE HE WAS GLAD TO SEE THREE HORSES STANDING AND HE MENTALLY CHOSE THE BLACK COB FOR HIS FLIGHT TO DOLLINGTON
I WAS ONLY A LITTLE STARTLED
HE SIR J.H PRESENTED HIS RESPECTS TO MR LARK_ENS OR LARK_INS OR LARK_ME OR LARK_US_--SIR J.H
SO I WILL SHE ANSWERED
SO I TALKED MY SUBLIMEST AND BRIGHTEST CHIT-CHAT IN MY MOST MUSICAL TONES AND WAS RATHER ENGAGING AND AMUSING I VENTURED TO HOPE
THIS TARN MAYBE--AND WITH THE THOUGHT THE WATER LOOKED BLACKER--AND A DEEPER AND COLDER SHADOW GATHERED OVER THE OMINOUS HOLLOW IN WHICH I STOOD AND THE RUSTLING IN THE WITHERED LEAVES SOUNDED ANGRILY
BUT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO IT ANY LONGER TILL I KNOW HER DECISION
L17 10 0 TEN POUNDS OF WHICH THE PREMIUM TOGETHER WITH FOUR POUNDS TEN SHILLINGS FOR EXPENSES C
AND I KNEW THINGS ABOUT HIM THAT OUGHT TO HAVE DAMNED HIM AND SHE'S WELL RID OF A BRANDED RASCAL
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW NO SAID MR LARKIN THOUGHTFULLY
BUT SHE FELT TOO FAINT AND ILL TO GET UP AND COMMENCE A RETREAT TOWARDS REDMAN'S FARM
IT WILL BE OVER IN A MINUTE
LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE PER CENT FOR MY MONEY IF I INSURE--AND POSSIBLY TO DEFEND AN ACTION BEFORE I'VE BEEN SIX MONTHS IN POSSESSION
THOUGH IF I PLEASED I MIGHT MAKE YOU MINE
BUT THERE WAS NO COMFORT THEN IN HIS THOUGHTS ONLY A SENSE OF FEAR AND HOPELESS FATIGUE
I TOLD HIM AT LAST THAT UNLESS HE WITHDREW YOUR FRIENDS SHOULD KNOW ALL
HE HAD QUITE SLEPT OFF WHAT HE WOULD HAVE CALLED THE NONSENSE OF LAST NIGHT AND WAS VERY KEEN UPON SETTLEMENTS CONSOLS MORTGAGES JOINTURES AND ALL THAT DRY BUT MOMENTOUS LORE
AND WITH ALL HER FAULTS SHE LOVES ME AND WILL LOVE YOU STILL MORE NO LORD CHELFORD NO SHE WAS PALE NOW AND LOOKING VERY SADLY IN HIS EYES
I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DOUBTED YOU AND SHE KISSED HER AGAIN
AND THEN SHE ASKED IS OUR PRECIOUS MANNIKIN ASLEEP WHICH ALSO BEING ANSWERED HAPPILY AS IT SHOULD BE SHE BID HER FUSSY ADIEUX WITH A MERRY SMILE AND HURRIED GABBLING AMICABLY WITH HER HANDMAID ACROSS THE LITTLE FLOWER-GARDEN
IT'S VERY SAD
2 HE OPENED THE WYLDER BOX FIRST AND GLANCED THROUGH A NEAT LITTLE STATEMENT OF TITLE PREPARED FOR COUNSEL WHEN DRAUGHTING THE DEED OF SETTLEMENT FOR THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS NEVER TO TAKE PLACE
AND TWICE WHEN HE WAS ON LEAVE WE HAD BEEN FOR MONTHS TOGETHER UNDER THE SAME ROOF
WHO ARE THEY SAID THE ATTORNEY AND HIS DOVE'S EYES WERE GONE AGAIN AND THE RAT'S EYES UNEQUIVOCALLY LOOKING OUT OF THE SMALL PINK LIDS
SHE WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM HER GAY FIERY SELF IN THIS WALK--SO GENTLE
THE PHARISEES EVEN WHILE DEVOURING WIDOWS HOUSES BELIEVED HONESTLY IN THEIR OWN SUPREME RIGHTEOUSNESS
SHE HELD FORTH HER HAND WHICH I DID LITTLE MORE THAN TOUCH
WELL THIS CERTAINLY IS NOT USUAL MURMURED MR LARKIN WHO WAS A LITTLE MORE PERTURBED THAN PERHAPS HE QUITE CARED TO ACKNOWLEDGE EVEN TO HIMSELF
BUT FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS OR FOR MELODRAMATIC SITUATIONS I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST TASTE
IT SAID WE SHALL SOON BE AT KNOWLTON--FOR CHRISTMAS I SUPPOSE
AND IF THEY GO TO PARTICULARISE YOU MAY SAY THE PLACES I HAVE BEEN AT
DON'T WAIT FOR ME ABOUT THE PARCHMENTS
WILL YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO SAY WHAT YOU THINK UPON THIS POINT
THE SILENCE THAT SUPERVENES IS INDICATIVE OF THE SOLITARY CHARACTER OF THE ENJOYMENT
WELL MY GOOD INVALUABLE FRIEND YOU WILL BE GLAD--YOU WILL REJOICE WITH US I KNOW TO LEARN THAT AFTER ALL THE SALE OF OUR REVERSION IS UNNECESSARY THE ATTORNEY ALLOWED HIS CLIENT TO SHAKE HIM BY BOTH HANDS AND HE SMILED A SINISTER CONGRATULATION AS WELL AS HE COULD GRINNING IN REPLY TO THE VICAR'S PLEASANT SMILE AS CHEERFULLY AS WAS FEASIBLE AND WOFULLY PUZZLED IN THE MEANTIME
NO--YOU COULD NOT SUPPOSE I MEANT SUCH AN IDEA--OH DEAR--NO NO
A HURRIED GLANCE ON THE TABLE SATISFYING HIM THAT NO SECRET PAPER OR DESPATCH LAY THERE HE CALLED COME IN AND MR LARCOM THE GRAVE BUTLER OF BRANDON WEARING OUTSIDE HIS PORTLY PERSON A BLACK GARMENT THEN KNOWN AS A ZEPHYR A WHITE CHOKER AND BLACK TROUSERS AND WELL POLISHED BUT RATHER SPLAY SHOES AND ON THE WHOLE HIS FAT AND SERIOUS ASPECT CONSIDERED BEING CAPABLE OF BEING MISTAKEN FOR A CHURCH DIGNITARY OR AT LEAST FOR AN EMINENT UNDERTAKER ENTERED THE ROOM WITH A SOLEMN AND GENTLEMANLIKE REVERENCE
IT IS A WONDERFUL LIKENESS SAID LORD CHELFORD
OH MY DEAR SIR MY DEAR CAPTAIN LAKE HOW COULD YOU--BUT OH
STILL THEY CAN'T HELP KNOWING SOMETHING OF THE BARRISTER'S SPECIAL PROVINCE
I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF PRESENTING MYSELF ALTHOUGH I FEAR AT A SOMEWHAT UNSEASONABLE HOUR BUT IN REFERENCE TO A LITTLE BUSINESS WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT I THINK BEAR TO BE DEFERRED NO BAD NEWS MR LARKIN I HOPE--NOTHING HAS HAPPENED
THAT IS SAID STANLEY RECOLLECTING THAT HE HAD MADE SOME VERY CREDITABLE MEALS AT THE SAME TABLE WHEN I SMOKE SO LATE AS I DID LAST NIGHT YOU DROVE MR WYLDER TO DOLLINGTON YES
THE BRANDON CONSERVATORY
THE ABSENCE OF AN ACCUSTOMED FACE EVEN THOUGH THE OWNER BE NOTHING VERY REMARKABLE IS ALWAYS FELT
BUT THERE WAS ALSO A GORGEOUS STAIN OF BLOOD THAT BATHED HIS EAR AND TEMPLE
REASON HAS AFTER ALL SO LITTLE TO DO WITH OUR MOODS
AND HIS MADE ME WINCE
BUT I'M AFRAID IT IS ENORMOUS
SHE MADE RAISIN-WINE AND THOSE CURIOUS BISCUITS THAT TASTED OF WINDSOR SOAP
BUT THE ATTORNEY LOOKED DOWN AND THEN UP WITH A SHADOW ON HIS FACE AND HIS LIP IN HIS FINGER AND THUMB AND HE SAID THAT'S ALL VERY WELL AND A SINE QUA NON SO FAR AS IT GOES
YOU WILL QUITE UNDERSTAND RESUMED THE ATTORNEY THE DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE WITH WHICH I MAKE THIS COMMUNICATION
IT WAS FANCY MERELY
BUT THOUGH HIS FACE WAS TURNED UP TOWARDS THE SKY THERE WAS A CONTRACTION AND A DARKNESS UPON IT NOT ALTOGETHER HEAVENLY
HAVING WHISPERED HIS ORISONS INTO HIS WELL-BRUSHED HAT AND TAKEN HIS SEAT HIS DOVE-LIKE EYES RESTED FOR A MOMENT UPON THE BRANDON SEAT
UNDER A LIKE HALF-DELUSION MR JOS
AND A COUNTENANCE THOUGH THEN GRAVE ENOUGH INSTINCT WITH A CERTAIN PROMISE OF ANIMATION AND SPIRIT NOT TO BE MISTAKEN
AND I WILL ALSO SAY HE CONTINUED A LITTLE HAUGHTILY THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SPARED YOUR CENSURE UNTIL AT LEAST YOU HAD HEARD WHAT I HAD TO SAY I DO BELIEVE YOU CHELFORD
TAKE CARE
THERE WAS NO SENTIMENTAL SOFTENING
THE STONE IS A HUMBUG SAID WYLDER
I HAVE A NOTION I SHA'N'T TROUBLE GYLINGDEN OR HER AFTER TO-MORROW RACHEL GLANCED QUICKLY AT HIM
THAT'S SINGING--PARTICULARLY LOUD SINGING
OLD LADY CHELFORD GLANCED ACROSS HER SHOULDER AT DORCAS WHO LEANED BACK IN A GREAT CHAIR BY THE WINDOW LISTLESSLY TURNING OVER A BOOK
FAMILY PRAYERS INDEED
IT IS ALL VERY FINE LAUGHING AT ME AND MY FANCIES
LARKIN TRIED HIS NEWSPAPER AND READ FOR TEN MINUTES OR SO PRETTY DILIGENTLY
IT WAS A FALLACY A MERE CHIMERA THAT WAS GONE
AS EASY AS THAT SAID LAKE CHUCKING A LITTLE BUNCH OF GRAPES FULL INTO SIR HARRY BRACTON'S HANDSOME FACE
BUT YOU'LL TAKE MY WORD OF HONOUR FOR IT YOU HAVE MADE THE MOST ABSURD MISTAKE THAT EVER AN OLD FOOL TUMBLED INTO
BUT I'M AFRAID I'M A STUBBORN CREATURE AND HAVE NOT THE FEMININE GIFT OF FLATTERY
AND WE'LL ALL LEAVE IF YOU PLEASE MR CRUTCHLEIGH IF THIS GOES ON THE FACT IS MRS CRUTCHLEIGH HAD GOT AN INKLING OF THIS PERFORMANCE AND HAD AFFECTED TO BELIEVE IT IMPOSSIBLE
HADN'T YOU A LETTER FROM HIS MOTHER LATELY
TAKE CARE SIR LORD CHELFORD'S COMING SAID THE YOUNG LADY HAUGHTILY WITH A CONTRACTED GLANCE OF HORROR FIXED ON LAKE
I'LL BUY YOU THAT TWENTY-FIVE GUINEA BOOK OF PICTURES--WHAT'S ITS NAME?--IF YOU GIVE ME THREE HUNDRED GUINEAS ONE MONTH AFTER I'M A PEER OF PARLIAMENT
AND JIM DUTTON ENTERED THE ROOM AND CLOSING THE DOOR MADE AT THE SIDE OF THE BED HIS REVERENCE CONSISTING OF A NOD AND A FAINT PLUCK AT THE LOCK OF HAIR OVER HIS FOREHEAD
STANLEY SHE REPEATED IN A CHANGED AND HORROR-STRICKEN WAY
INDEED SIR PLEASE MASTER FAIRY WAS RAISING THE ROOF A NURSERY PHRASE WHICH IMPLIED INDESCRIBABLE BELLOWING AND AS NAUGHTY AS COULD BE UNTIL MISSIS ALLOWED HIM TO COME AFTER YOU OH
OLD TAMAR I ALWAYS THOUGHT HAD SEEN MANY UNTOLD THINGS IN HER DAY AND SOME OF HER RECOLLECTIONS TROUBLED HER I DARE SAY
YOU NEVER DID MIND LITTLE STANNIE WHEN HE WAS NAUGHTY YOU KNOW THERE WAS HERE A LITTLE SUBSIDENCE IN HIS SPEECH
IT IS BETTER TO TAKE THINGS ON TRUST WITH SOMETHING OF DISTANCE AND INDISTINCTNESS
IT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS HOWEVER TO CONTINUE A CONTEST OF THIS KIND
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED DARLING
MR WYLDER
OF COURSE WHEN GREAT GUNS ARE PRESENT AND PEOPLE TALK PRO BONO PUBLICO ONE AT A TIME WITH PARLIAMENTARY REGULARITY THINGS ARE DIFFERENT
CHAPTER IX
THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE WINDOWS OF THE READING-ROOM AND IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM BENEATH IT
AND YOU OPENED IT AND LEANED YOUR HAND UPON YOUR HEAD SICK-LIKE READING IT
SMOOTH CHEEKS LIGHT BROWN CURLING MOUSTACHE AND EYES VERY PECULIAR BOTH IN SHAPE AND COLOUR AND SOMETHING OF ELEGANCE OF FINISH IN HIS OTHER FEATURES AND OF GENERAL GRACE IN THE COUP D'OEIL STRUCK ONE AT A GLANCE
STANLEY IS CLEVER AND CUNNING I THINK BUT HE IS NEITHER WISE NOR FRANK
NEVER MIND AND LAKE PULLED ON HIS WHITE GLOVE GLANCING DOWN THE FILE OF SILENT WAITERS-SOME LOOKING FRIGHTENED AND SOME RESERVED--IN WHITE TIES AND WAISTCOATS AND HE GLIDED OUT OF THE ROOM--HIS MIND SOMEWHERE ELSE--LIKE A SOMNAMBULIST
WYLDER WAS GLOWERING AND ABSTRACTED--WORSE COMPANY THAN USUAL
I'VE SEEN LOTS OF OUR FELLOWS HIT YOU KNOW AND I DON'T LIKE HIS LOOKS--POOR FELLOW
THE WINDOWS HOWEVER WERE DARK AND A LITTLE RESEARCH SATISFIED CAPTAIN LAKE THAT THE COLONY WAS IN BED
AND THOUGH HE WAS NOT OF COURSE AFRAID OF GHOSTS NOR IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD OF ROBBERS YET SOMEHOW HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS GIGANTIC GRAY MONKEY
YOU MAY WANT A TRIFLE TO BALK S.L.'S ELECTIONEERING AND THERE'S AN ORDER ON LAKE FOR 200_L DON'T TRIFLE ABOUT THE COUNTY AND BOROUGH
LARKIN WORE A MASK
ITS TALK WAS IN WHISPERS
WRITING HOWEVER IN IGNORANCE OF WHAT MAY SINCE HAVE PASSED AT BRANDON I MAY BE ASSUMING A STATE OF THINGS WHICH POSSIBLY NO LONGER EXISTS
BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY FOR THERE'S NOTHING IN IT
IT IS EASY TO LOOK GRAVE OVER POOR RACHEL'S SLIGHT AND PARTLY UNCONSCIOUS SHARE IN THE BUSINESS OF THE TRAGEDY
A GREAT MATCH WAS PLAYED BETWEEN THOSE FELLOWS AT BRIGHTON
THE BRIDE HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT
SO THAT'S OFF YOUR MIND MY DEAR SIR OH MR LARKIN--MY--MY--YOU DON'T KNOW SIR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME--THE AGONY--OH THANK GOD
IT WAS ALL THAT BOTTLE AND THAT MIRACULOUS CHILD
THERE ARE THOSE WHO HOVER ABOUT THE BED AND NOTE EVERY GLEAM AND GLOW OF SUBSIDING LIFE AND WILL READ IN SUNSET SOMETHING OF THE COLOURS OF THE DAWN AND CLING WILDLY TO THESE HALLUCINATIONS OF LOVE
CHAPTER XLVI
OR FROM STRIPPING A MAN OF HIS POSSESSIONS AND TRANSFERRING THEM TO HIMSELF BY PROCESSES FROM WHICH MOST MEN WOULD SHRINK
THE PRETTY PARSONAGE WAS NOW CLOSE BY
IT WAS NOT QUITE TIME TO GO HOME
BUT HIS PLEASURES AND ALL HIS WAYS ARE STILL SIMPLE
BUT THERE BEING NOTHING OF THE KIND HE WAS FAIN TO ABIDE AT HIS CORNER
TWICE FOR A MOMENT THEIR EYES MET
AND THEN AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE HE BEGAN UNCOMFORTABLY TO MOVE DOWN THE PATH ONCE MORE
AND DID NOT SEEM TO WISH TO LEAD ME TO THE SUBJECT
CAPTAIN LAKE KNEW VERY WELL AND GRACEFULLY PRACTISED THE ART OF NOT SEEING INCONVENIENT ACQUAINTANCES IN THE STREET
HOW DO YOU DO LAKE
I HAVE SOLD MY COMMISSION SHE LOOKED STRAIGHT AT HIM WITH LARGE EYES AND COMPRESSED LIPS AND NODDED HER HEAD TWO OR THREE TIMES JUST MURMURING WELL
YOU SEEM TO BE VERY SENSIBLE MR DE CRESSERON
WHEN IT IS DONE HE WILL BE LIKE ME HUMANO MAJOR
AND YOU MUST ADVISE ME
I'LL GO WITH YOU AND SEE HIM AND DISABUSE HIM
EVERY FELLOW PARTICULARLY THESE GENTLEMANLIKE FELLOWS THEY HAVE A PLUCK AT YOU WHEN THEY CAN
AND HE DESIRED THAT SHE SHOULD SEND HIM TO HIS HOTEL TO SEE HIM IN THE MORNING
A CELESTIAL GRATITUDE GLOWED AND EXPANDED WITHIN HIS BREAST
JIM WAS IN LONDON LOOKING FOR A SITUATION ALL WHICH PLEASED CAPTAIN LAKE
I SOMETIMES THINK I HAVE ONLY MYSELF TO BLAME
MR LARKIN WALKED DOWN DIRECT TO GYLINGDEN AND PAID A RATHER AWFUL VISIT TO MR DRIVER OF THE POST-OFFICE
HAVEN'T I
YES THE POSTMARKS CORRESPOND
IT WAS REALLY A HUMAN HAND AND ARM DISCLOSED BY THE SLIPPING OF THE BANK
AND AGAIN IN THE ILLUSIVE SENSE OF DELIVERANCE THE POOR VICAR'S HOPES BRIGHTENED AND EXPANDED
LARKIN IS VIS-A-VIS WITH A CONCEALED COMPANION
OH NO IT IS ONLY ANNE SINGING
YOUR OTHER CLIENT IS NOT ILL--NOTHING SAD ABOUT MARK WYLDER I HOPE NO--NOTHING SAD CAPTAIN LAKE--NOTHING--BUT A GOOD DEAL THAT IS STRANGE OH IS THERE SAID LAKE IN HIS SOFT TONES LEANING FORWARD IN HIS EASY CHAIR AND LOOKING ON THE SHINING POINTS OF HIS BOOTS
YOU KNOW THIS GOES UNDER GROUND ALL THE WAY TO VALLAMBROSA THANK YOU
NOW MY GOOD OLD TAMAR YOU REALLY CAN'T BE SUCH AN IDIOT AS TO FANCY THERE CAN BE ANY IMAGINABLE WRONG IN KEEPING THAT PRYING LITTLE SLUT IN IGNORANCE OF THAT WHICH IN NO WISE CONCERNS HER
HOW VERY SENSIBLE
WITH HIS LITTLE BAG IN HIS HAND HE WENT DOWN STAIRS THINKING UNPLEASANTLY I BELIEVE AND JUMPED INTO THE HANSOM THAT AWAITED HIM AT THE DOOR TELLING THE MAN TO GO TO THE
THE INFERIOR ANIMALS--AS WE SEE THEM CAGED AND CARED FOR AND FED AT ONE O'CLOCK PRECISE IN THOSE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS PROVIDED FOR THEIR MAINTENANCE--CONFINE THEIR UPROAR TO THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY ANTECEDENT TO THEIR MEAL AND PERFORM THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF DEGLUTITION WITH SILENT ATTENTION AND ONLY SUCH SUCKINGS LAPPINGS AND CRUNCHINGS AS ILLUSTRATE THEIR INDUSTRY AND CONTENT
HOW PASSEE THIS CREATURE WAS TILL I MADE HER TOILET AND HOW WONDERFULLY THE POOR OLD BEAUTY LOOKS NOW AND SHE GLANCED COMPLACENTLY AT THE PLANT SHE HAD JUST TRIMMED
I'VE NO DOUBT MISS LAKE IS A VERY INTELLIGENT PERSON AND WHEN NOT EXCITED WILL SEE IT CLEARLY THE ATTORNEY'S MANNER HAD SOMETHING OF THAT RESERVE AND GRIM SORT OF DRYNESS WHICH SUPERVENED WHENEVER HE FANCIED A FRIEND OR CLIENT ON WHOM HE HAD FORMED DESIGNS WAS BECOMING IMPRACTICABLE
THE TENANTRY WERE AFTERWARDS HANDSOMELY ENTERTAINED UNDER THE IMMEDIATE DIRECTION OF JOSIAH LARKIN ESQ OF THE LODGE THE RESPECTED MANAGER OF THE BRANDON ESTATES AT THE BRANDON ARMS IN THE TOWN OF GYLINGDEN
HERE HAD BEEN MARK WYLDER
I AM NOT A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN NOW STANLEY
YOU STAND THERE LIKE AN EVIL SPIRIT WITH SOME PURPOSE WHICH I CANNOT DIVINE
QUITE WELL
AND THEN THE VICAR SAID I AM AFRAID I HAVE QUITE UNINTENTIONALLY OFFENDED YOU MR LARKIN--PERHAPS IN MY IGNORANCE OF BUSINESS
IF THE CASE WERE MINE I SHOULD BE MUCH TEMPTED TO SPEAK WITH THE DETECTIVE AUTHORITIES AND TRY WHETHER THEY MIGHT NOT GIVE THEIR ASSISTANCE OF COURSE WITHOUT ECLAT
HOLLO CRIED LAKE
WHICH WAS TO GERMINATE IN A LITTLE WHILE INTO HOWARD
IT IS PAINFUL TO ME TO DISCLOSE WHAT I KNOW BUT THAT YOUNG LADY ACCOMPANIED MR MARK WYLDER MY LORD IN HIS MIDNIGHT FLIGHT FROM DOLLINGTON AND REMAINED IN LONDON UNDER I PRESUME HIS PROTECTION FOR SOME TIME THAT STATEMENT SIR IS I HAPPEN TO KNOW UTTERLY CONTRARY TO FACT
BUT I CANNOT OVERCOME MY REPUGNANCE--AND I WON'T TRY I WONDER SAID STANLEY WITH A SLY LOOK OF ENQUIRY THAT YOU WHO READ THE BIBLE--AND A VERY GOOD BOOK IT IS NO DOUBT--AND BELIEVE IN ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT WILL DO STANLEY
YOU WERE ALWAYS A SHARP GIRL RADIE AND I THINK YOU DO SEE IT HE SAID AT LAST VERY QUIETLY
BUT YOU ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT DORKIE IN SUPPOSING THAT I AM UNDER VERY CONSIDERABLE APPREHENSION FROM THEIR MACHINATIONS
I'M TAKEN BY CONVERSATION--AND ALL THAT
BUT IF IT WERE SO AND THAT YOUR BROTHER REALLY WISHED--DO YOU THINK HE DOES MR LARKIN?--TO BUY THE REVERSION HE MIGHT THINK IT MORE VALUABLE PERHAPS I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY SIR THAT FROM THAT QUARTER YOU WOULD GET NOTHING LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE AGREED TO TAKE
SHE WAS LOOKING AT HIM WITH A WILD STERN STARE STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AND HE STILL HOLDING HER ARM AND CLOSE TO HER
IT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POOR RACHEL ILL AND TROUBLED DEAR--TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISERABLY NERVOUS POOR RACHEL
VERY PLEASANT THIS SAID THE ATTORNEY AFTER A PAUSE RECOVERING A LITTLE
I WAS THINKING OF A FEW MINUTES WALK UPON THE TERRACE BUT YOU ARE FATIGUED
BUT YOU SHA'N'T SPEAK MORE THAN YOU LIKE
DON'T DISAPPOINT
MY DEAR MISS LAKE I RESPECT AND ESTEEM YOU
AND HIS MOTHER WHO NEVER MINCED MATTERS SAID PERHAPS MORE THAN SHE QUITE THOUGHT
HE HAD HIS FACE TO YOUR EAR WHEN I CAME IN
LARCOM PRESENTED HIM WITH A NOTE IN A SEALED ENVELOPE
BUT SOON A REACTION CAME AND I FELT CONVINCED THAT THE APPARITION WAS A LIVING MAN
AND YOU WILL PLEASE SPECIALLY NOT TO MENTION IT TO ANY PERSON WHATSOEVER
AND THAT'S HOW THE CAPTING AND MISS RACHEL LAKE THEY CARRIED ON THEIR DISPUTE LIKE THOUGH ME COMING INTO THE ROOM JUST SO
WE TAKE LEAVE OF OUR FRIENDS
THIS PRONENESS TO SUDDEN ACCESSES OF VIOLENCE AND FURY WAS THE COMPENSATION WHICH ABATED THE EFFECT OF HIS ORDINARY CRAFT AND SELF-COMMAND
POOR MISS RADIE SHE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING BUT WHAT WAS GOOD FROM OLD TAMAR WHATEVER I MIGHT HA BIN MYSELF MISERABLE SINNERS ARE WE ALL
MR LARKIN KNEW THAT DRIVER'S CLERKS WERE HIS DAUGHTERS IT IS NOT EASY TO MEET WITH A YOUNG FELLOW THAT IS QUITE HONEST
THEY HAD PRODUCED THEIR MADMEN AND VILLAINS TOO
AT ALL EVENTS IT WOULD BE WELL TO MAKE YOUR CLERKS RECOLLECT THEMSELVES
AND I AM SURE OF A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT EITHER FOR THE COUNTY OR FOR DOLLINGTON AS YOU KNOW AND CAN DO BETTER FOR HIM THEN
I WAS NOT AWARE
WON'T THAT BE PRETTY SAID RACHEL PARTING HIS GOLDEN LOCKS OVER THE YOUNG FOREHEAD AND KISSING HIM
TAKE CARE TO SAY IT AND WE'LL HAVE IT WELL REPORTED IN THE CHRONICLE AND OUR LADS WON'T MIND IT NOR HEAR IT NEITHER FOR THAT MATTER SO THERE WAS MOUNTING IN HOT HASTE IN THE COURTYARD OF OLD BRANDON AND A RATHER PONDEROUS SELECTION OF WALKING-STICKS BY THE POLITICIANS--OF WHOM I WAS ONE--INTENDED FOR THE WINDOWS OF THE ASSEMBLY ROOM
A FOREIGN LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM HAD MOST POSITIVELY BEEN LOST
THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED UP WITH HER WATERY EYES WIDE OPEN AND THERE WAS A SHORT PAUSE
BY THIS TIME SHE WAS STANDING
AND HIS LONG PALMS WERE RAISED AND WAVED OR RATHER PADDLED SLOWLY TO THE RHYTHM OF THE SENTIMENT
HE WILL PROBABLY BE HERE TO-MORROW
AND I REALLY DID NOT MUCH CARE WHETHER I WERE KILLED OR NOT
OF COURSE IT WAS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF THEN
I DON'T MIND DREAMS TAMAR NOR FORTUNE-TELLERS--I'VE DREAMED SO MANY GOOD DREAMS AND NO GOOD EVER CAME OF THEM
WE DROVE BY THE SMALL OLD HOUSE AT THE LEFT WITH ITS DOUBLE GABLE AND PRETTY GRASS GARDEN AND TRIM YEWS AND MODERN LILACS AND LABURNUMS BACKED BY THE GRAND TIMBER OF THE PARK
A MAN PUSHED HIS WAY TO THE FRONT OF THE CROWD AND FOR A MOMENT IT SEEMED THAT MARK WYLDER STOOD LIVING BEFORE THEM
LET US GO TOGETHER AND TO THIS DOLLY READILY ASSENTED
SHE HAD A LARGE WHITE KERCHIEF PINNED WITH A GRISLY PRECISION ACROSS HER BREAST AND A WHITE LINEN CAP TIED UNDER HER CHIN FITTING CLOSE TO HER HEAD LIKE A CHILD'S NIGHTCAP SUCH AS THEY WORE IN MY YOUNG DAYS AND DESTITUTE OF BORDER OR FRILLING ABOUT THE FACE
OLD TAMAR HAS BEHAVED ADMIRABLY RACHEL SIGHED AGAIN AND SAID YES--POOR TAMAR AND NOW DEAR I'M AFRAID I MUST LEAVE YOU--I'M VERY SORRY
ON THE CONTRARY HE REALLY BELIEVED I AM CONVINCED THAT HE SCOUTED THE GHOST AND HAD MERELY VOLUNTEERED THIS SALUTARY SELF-EXAMINATION AS AN EXERCISE OF CONSCIENCE
WE'RE NOT VERY RICH YOU AND I
READ THAT SAID LAKE TOSSING GYBES NOTE TO HIM
THERE AMONG OLD WYLDER AND BRANDON TOMBS--SOME PAINTED STONE EFFIGIES OF THE PERIOD OF ELIZABETH AND THE FIRST JAMES AND SOME MUCH OLDER--STONE AND MARBLE KNIGHTS PRAYING ON THEIR BACKS WITH THEIR SPURS ON AND SAID TO HAVE BEEN REMOVED NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO FROM THE ABBEY OF NAUNTON FRIARS WHEN THAT FAMOUS MONASTERY BEGAN TO LOSE ITS ROOF AND TURN INTO A PICTURESQUE RUIN AND BY-GONE GENERATIONS OF WYLDERS AND BRANDONS HAD OFFERED UP THEIR CONSPICUOUS DEVOTIONS WITH--JUDGING FROM THEIR HEATHEN LIVES--I FEAR NO VERY REMARKABLE EFFICACY
IN THE DUTCH ROOM
AND YOU WANT A NEW GOWN MRS DUTTON
BUT IT WAS IN MATTERS OF SOME MOMENT THAT ONE PERCEIVED IT
THAT IS OF COURSE UNDER PROPER CONDITIONS AND WITH A DUE SENSE OF ITS SACRED CHARACTER AND A--A--OBLIGATIONS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS LOVE CONTINUED MISS BRANDON
LAWYER LARKIN'S MIND BEGINS TO WORK
AND YOU WON'T LEAVE ME RADIE I'M CERTAIN I'LL STAY DEAR AS YOU WISH IT SAID RACHEL KISSING HER
THEY ARE WHIPPING THEIR MEN UP AWFULLY
A SHOUT OF HORROR BROKE FROM US ALL
A MYSTERY IMPLIED A DIFFICULTY OF A DELICATE AND FORMIDABLE SORT
AT LEAST IT PROVED THAT DUTTON ASSUMED THE CAPTAIN TO BE SPECIALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT CONCERNED MARK WYLDER'S FATE
BUT IT COULD NOT LAST FOR EVER
AND BRAVE RACHEL WOULD QUITE MASTER IT
DORCAS SAYS THERE IS NO USE IN WRITING
WELL I DARE SAY IT WAS AS LONG AS THE UMBRELLA HE GOT UP WITH THE SAME PERPLEXED AND ABSENT LOOK AS HE SAID THIS AND THREW AN ANXIOUS GLANCE ABOUT THE ROOM AS IF LOOKING FOR SOMETHING HE HAD MISLAID
THE MARE LAY STONE DEAD ON HER SIDE AT THE BOTTOM
HE WAS THINKING OF GIVING HER A CROWN BUT THERE WERE SEVERAL REASONS AGAINST IT SO THAT HANDSOME COIN REMAINED IN HIS PURSE
WELL HE DOES LOOK MORE TIRED BUT THAT MUST BE TILL HIS RECOVERY BEGINS WHICH WILL BE PLEASE HEAVEN IMMEDIATELY OH YES MY LITTLE MAN HAS HAD TWO OR THREE ATTACKS MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN THIS AND ALWAYS SHOOK THEM OFF SO EASILY I WAS REMINDING DOLLY ALWAYS AND GOOD DOCTOR BUDDLE ASSURES US IT IS NONE OF THOSE HORRID COMPLAINTS AND SO THEY TALKED OVER THE CASE OF THE LITTLE MAN WHO WITH NOAH AND HIS SONS AND THE BATTERED SOLDIERS AND ANIMALS BEFORE HIM WAS FIGHTING THOUGH THEY ONLY DIMLY KNEW IT SILENTLY IN HIS LITTLE BED THE GREAT BATTLE OF LIFE OR DEATH
AND WE MUST DO NOTHING PRECIPITATELY
MARK HAS NO COFFIN
AND HE'S A SLOW COACH TOO I THREW IN
OH UNCLE
THIS THOMAS TUPTON WAS SOMETHING OF A SPORTING CELEBRITY AND A LIKELY MAN ENOUGH TO BE OF MARK'S ACQUAINTANCE
AND THIS PERHAPS WAS THE REASON WHY HE HAD CONTRACTED HIS HABIT OF LAUGHING AND GRINNING A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN THE FUN OF THE DIALOGUE ALWAYS WARRANTED
SUCH A FRIEND AS HAS BEEN RAISED UP TO US IN THAT HOLY AND WISE MAN WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS
AND BESOUGHT THE PRIEST WHEN SHE WAS DYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE HER LAID IN THE ABBEY VAULT WITH HER MOUTH OPEN AND HER EYES AND EARS SEALED IN TOKEN THAT HER TERM OF SLAVERY WAS OVER THAT HER LIPS MIGHT NOW BE OPEN AND THAT HER EYES WERE TO SEE NO MORE THE DREADFUL SIGHT NOR HER EARS TO HEAR THE FRIGHTFUL WORDS THAT USED TO SCARE THEM IN HER LIFE-TIME
HE WAS SPEAKING WITH DIFFICULTY
NOT THAT THEY WERE MUCH TROUBLED WITH DANGERS FROM ANY SUCH QUARTER
SELFISH OLD THING
I SWEAR IT MY DARLING UPON MY HONOUR AND SOUL AND I WILL SWEAR IT IN ANY TERMS--THE MOST AWFUL THAT CAN BE PRESCRIBED--IN ORDER TOTALLY AND FOR EVER TO REMOVE FROM YOUR MIND SO AMAZING A FANCY AND WITH A LITTLE LAUGH AND STILL HOLDING HER HAND HE PASSED HIS ARM ROUND HER WAIST AND KISSED HER AFFECTIONATELY
THEY HAD NOW REACHED THOSE RUDE STONE STEPS SOME TEN OR FIFTEEN IN NUMBER WHICH CONDUCT THE NARROW FOOTPATH UP A PARTICULARLY STEEP ACCLIVITY AND HERE LAKE LOST COURAGE AGAIN FOR THEY DISTINCTLY HEARD THE FOOTSTEPS THAT PACED THE PLATFORM ABOVE
THE ATTORNEY QUIETLY BOLTED HIS STUDY DOOR AND STOOD ERECT WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LOOKING STERNLY DOWN ON THE LETTERS
IT COULD NOT BE
HAD IT ACTUALLY OCCURRED THAT STRANGE CONFESSION OF DORCAS BRANDON'S
YOU KNOW ME--EH CAPTAIN LAKE
SHE'S A TREMENDIOUS FINE GIRL BY JOVE
I DON'T KNOW INDEED THAT HE EVER TOOK IT OFF
BUT YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING IT IS NOT A THING TO BE DONE IN A MOMENT YOU CAN IF YOU PLEASE DO A GREAT DEAL IN A MOMENT CERTAINLY
AND BY JOVE HE'LL HAVE UP EVERY SOUL CONCERNED
HER ONLY BROTHER
HE WOULD HAVE TALKED TO UGLY MRS W
AND I LOVE YOU ALL THE SAME THANK YOU DORCAS DEAR
THERE IT WAS NO MISTAKE NOW
CAPTAIN LAKE LOOKS IN AT NIGHTFALL
AND RACHEL LAUGHED A SOFT LITTLE LAUGH AFTER IT LOOKING AMUSED AND VERY LOVINGLY ON HER COUSIN
AND THERE ARE NICE PICKINGS AMONG THE CHARITIES AND ENDOWMENTS AND PURCHASES OF BUILDING SITES AND TRUST DEEDS
STILL IT WAS AN ABSTRACT BREACH OF PROMISE AND WOULD HAVE MUCH IMPROVED BY SOME OUTWARD AND VISIBLE SIGN OF DISRUPTION AND DISAPPOINTMENT
WELL I SUPPOSE I TOO MUST SAY GOOD-BYE
HIS FACE TOO WAS BROADER AND COARSER BUT IN FEATURES AND LIMBS THE RELATIVE PROPORTIONS WERE WONDERFULLY PRESERVED
AND WHAT THE DEVIL HAVE I TO DO WITH SECRETS
OH RACHEL DEAR IF THIS IS BROKEN OFF I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US--I DON'T KNOW DOLLY SPOKE QUITE WILDLY WITH HER HANDS ON RACHEL'S SHOULDERS
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT EXCLAMATION I MADE
OH STANLEY IN MERCY TELL ME WAS THERE ANY OTHER ENGAGEMENT NOTHING DARLING--NOTHING ON EARTH OF THE SORT AND HE SPOKE WITH AN ICY LITTLE LAUGH
AND THE GOOD LITTLE MAMMA CALLED TO HER MAID-OF-ALL-WORK FROM THE WINDOW HAS THE MASTER COME YET BECKY NO MA'AM PLEASE AND I THINK SHE OFFERED UP A LITTLE THANKSGIVING SHE SO LONGED TO GIVE HIM HIS TEA HERSELF
AND THE VICAR AND HIS WIFE HAD QUITE A CHEERY CHAT OVER THE FIRE AND HE AND SHE BOTH AGREED HE WOULD MAKE A HANDSOME SUM BY EUSEBIUS
MARK SORELY AGAINST THE GRAIN AND WITH NO GOOD GRACE AT LAST CONSENTED TO ADVANCE L300 IN THIS DREAD EMERGENCY AND THE VICAR BLESSED HIS BENEFACTOR AND IN HIS CLOSET ON HIS KNEES SHED TEARS OF THANKFULNESS OVER HIS DELIVERANCE AND THE SKY OPENED AND THE FLOWERS LOCKED BRIGHT AND LIFE GREW PLEASANT ONCE MORE
SHE HAS ONE OF HER MISERABLE HEADACHES POOR THING
BUT IT WILL BE WISER AND BETTER TERRIBLE AS IT MAY BE THAT THE REVELATION SHOULD COME FROM YOU WHOM SHE HAS MADE HER HUSBAND
AND THEN IN THE SAME TONE AND WITH THE SAME COUNTENANCE HE ASKED IS THE BLOOD ON MY FOREHEAD I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I ANSWERED
OH NONE THANK YOU
SHE'S A LITTLE BIT NOISY TO-NIGHT THOUGHT THE ATTORNEY AS HE DESCENDED THE ROAD TO GYLINGDEN
MAY ONE HEAR IT SAID LAKE IN THE SAME SILKEN TONE AND LOOKING DOWN AS BEFORE ON HIS BOOTS
AND I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT OUR FRIEND CAPTAIN LAKE PLAYED FIRST AT ONE AND THEN AT THE OTHER WITH WHAT SUCCESS EXACTLY I DON'T KNOW
SATURDAY IS IT
THEN HOWARD LARKIN HOWARD AND THE FIVE GAKS HOWARDS WOULD COME TO BE VERY GREAT PEOPLE INDEED
THERE ARE A CERTAIN SOBER LITERALITY AND MATERIALISM IN OLD AGE WHICH ABATE THE ILLUSIONS OF THE SUPERNATURAL AS EFFECTUALLY AS THOSE OF LOVE
A STATEMENT IS MERE HEARSAY COMFORTED SOMEWHAT REASSURED IN A CERTAIN WAY AND IN STRONG HOPES THAT AT ALL EVENTS SUCH A MUDDLE WOULD BE ESTABLISHED AS TO BEWILDER THE JURY MR JOS
THIS IS THE REASON WHY SUSPENSE IS SO INTOLERABLE AND THE RETROSPECT EVEN OF THE WORST LESS TERRIBLE
WILL NOTHING CONTENT YOU WHY I GRUMBLE VERY LITTLE I THINK CONSIDERING HOW WELL OFF I AM REJOINED HE WITH A LAUGH
AND YET SEEING--FOR YOU DID SEE IT--THAT I WOULD NOW RATHER BE ALONE YOU PERSIST IN WALKING WITH ME AND TALKING OF TREES AND AIR AND CELESTIAL EVENINGS AND THINKING OF SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
IT WAS A DRESS VERY ODD AND UNPLEASANT TO BEHOLD AND SUGGESTED THE IDEA OF AN HOSPITAL OR A MADHOUSE OR DEATH IN AN UNDEFINED WAY
OR ELSE IT HAD GONE ON TO THE GREAT RAILWAY CONTRACTOR DOBBS AND THE QUESTION HOW MANY VOTES HIS INFLUENCE WAS REALLY WORTH
SO LONG AS THIS APPARITION REMAINED BEFORE ME I NEVER DOUBTED ITS BEING SUPERNATURAL
BUT THERE IS NO REASON WHY CAPTAIN LAKE SHOULD OBJECT
I DON'T THINK MARK WAS VERY CLEAR AS TO WHAT HE WANTED OR EVEN IF HE HAD HAD A COOL HALF-HOUR TO DEFINE HIS WISHES THAT HE WOULD SERIOUSLY HAVE MODIFIED EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS
HIS ABSENCE I WILL LAY MY LIFE WILL BE SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR
WE HAD BEEN FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS AT SCHOOL TOGETHER
THENCE HE BEHELD THEM COME AT LAST SLOWLY TO A STAND-STILL TALK EVIDENTLY A LITTLE MORE AND FINALLY THEY SHOOK HANDS--AN INDEFINABLE SOMETHING STILL OF SUPERIORITY IN LAKE'S AIR--AND PARTED
BUT IF IT BE SO THE FAULT IS NOT MINE NO DORCAS THE FAULT IS NOT YOURS NOR MINE
GOOD-NIGHT RADIE
SO THIS GAY ASTUTE MAN OF FASHION HAD FALLEN INTO THE DUNGEON OF SUDDEN DARKNESS AND THE CUSTODY OF OLD WOMEN
THE SAME OCCURRED AT CHARTERIS
HE WITH TWO OR THREE YOUNG SWELLS BY HIM HAD MADE A SPEECH FROM HIS BAROUCHE OUTSIDE THE SILVER LION NEAR THE GREEN
BUT AS HE MOUNTED THE STONE STEPS THAT CONDUCTED THE PASSENGER UP THE STEEP ACCLIVITY TO THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE DARK AND NARROW WALK HE WAS PURSUING ONE BLACK SORROW MET HIM AND BLOTTED OUT ALL THE REST
THE VOID AND THE DARKNESS BROUGHT BACK I SUPPOSE MY RECOLLECTION OF THE DUBIOUS TERMS ON WHICH THESE YOUNG MEN STOOD AND A FEELING OF THE HOLLOWNESS AND DELUSION OF THE GENIAL HOURS JUST PASSED UNDER THE BRILLIANT LIGHTS TOGETHER WITH AN UNPLEASANT SENSE OF APPREHENSION
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT OF COURSE IT CAN LEAD TO NOTHING AND THERE'S NO USE IN MY SPEAKING TO WYLDER AND SO THERE'S AN END OF IT THERE MAY BE SOME USE A PURPOSE IN WHICH NEITHER MY FEELINGS NOR INTERESTS HAVE ANY PART
IS LARCOM THERE IN THE GALLERY MI LOR ASK HIM TO COME IN SO MONSIEUR LARCOM ENTERED AND BOWED OMINOUSLY
LAKE AND LARKIN YOU KNOW MIGHT BE MISTAKEN
LARKIN PRESENTED THIS LITTLE ORDER IT WAS IN THE HANDSOME SQUARE ROOM IN WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE TRANSACTED BUSINESS--A LOFTY APARTMENT WAINSCOTED IN CARVED OAK AND WITH A GREAT STONE MANTELPIECE WITH THE WYLDER ARMS PROJECTING IN BOLD RELIEF IN THE CENTRE AND A FLORID SCROLL WITH RESURGAM STANDING FORTH AS SHARP AS THE DAY IT WAS CHISELLED NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE
1 AND NO
1 AND NO
IT WAS A STRANGE SHOCK--IMMENSE RELIEF--IMMENSE HORROR--QUITE OVERWHELMING
AND I RESISTED I BELIEVE BUT I DON'T NOW
BUT THE CHANGE IN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WAS SO AMAZING AND MOMENTOUS
BUT YOU'LL CHOOSE IT FOR ME WON'T YOU
THIS LEGAL INSTRUMENT WAS ATTESTED BY TWO WITNESSES AND BORE DATE ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE THE INTERVIEW JUST RELATED BETWEEN THE VICAR AND MR LARKIN
WYLDER WAS AN ENERGETIC AND SOMEWHAT VIOLENT PERSON WITH HIGH ANIMAL COURAGE AND WOULD BE SURE TO BLOW UP AND BREAK THROUGH ANY SUCH MACHINATION
I ONLY MENTIONED IT
WHENEVER HE WAS AWAY HE INTERPOLATED BRANDON MANOR AND STUCK IT ON HIS VALISE AND HAT-CASE
DON'T THANK--NOT A WORD--BUT LISTEN
AND WORSE STILL HE HAD PUBLISHED A SLENDER VOLUME OF POEMS AND A BULKIER TOME OF ESSAYS SCHOLASTIC AND THEOLOGIC BOTH WHICH VENTURES NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR MERITS HAD TURNED OUT UNHAPPILY
HE KNEW THE PATH AS HE HAD BOASTED TO LORD CHELFORD FROM HIS BOYHOOD
BUT THEN SHE HAD BEEN VERY GUARDED
WYLDER'S DRESS-COATS ALWAYS SMELT OF TOBACCO AND HIS TALK OF TAR
LAKE RODE
AND HE READ I CANNOT TELL YOU MY POOR BROTHER HOW MISERABLE I AM
SHE'S CLEVER--AND I DON'T THINK SHE GIVES ME UP YET NO--A DRINK!--AND THEY THINK I'M MORE HURT THAN I REALLY AM--BUDDLE YOU KNOW--ONLY AN APOTHECARY--VILLAGE AND HE GROANED
I DON'T SEE HOW WE'RE TO GET THE BULLET OUT OF HIM WITHOUT MISCHIEF
RACHEL KNEW THAT A TRAGEDY MIGHT BE--AT THAT INSTANT AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THAT VERY SPECTACLE--GATHERING ITS THUNDERS SILENTLY IN ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM WHERE SHE SAW STANLEY'S PALE PECULIAR FACE
BUT SUCH A LOSS HE WOULD SAY HE COULD NOT AFFORD
HE MARCHED INTO THE TOWN RATHER QUICKLY LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BUSINESS ON HIS HANDS
SHE'S AWFULLY SLOW
A YEAR AND A-HALF MAYBE OR POSSIBLY A YEAR MIGHT DO
AND MOST ASSUREDLY THOUGHT MR LARKIN THERE IS SOME INFERNAL SECRET WELL WORTH KNOWING AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THIS
A NURSE WHO HAD BEEN CALLED IN FROM THE COUNTY INFIRMARY SAID HE MADE A VERY HAPPY ENDING
THAT YELLOW LEVEL LIGHT HAS IN MY MIND SOMETHING UNDEFINABLY GLORIOUS AND MELANCHOLY SUCH AS TO MAKE ALMOST ANY SCENERY INTERESTING AND MY SOLITARY WALK WAS DELIGHTFUL
THE SUPPER-ROOM
I PREFER REMAINING HAVE YOU OBSERVED HOW DORCAS HAS TREATED ME THIS EVENING NO STANLEY
OH THE YEARNING UNIMAGINABLE FOR QUIET AND REST
SO SOON AS DORCAS OBTAINED A HEARING WHICH WAS NOT FOR SOMETIME--FOR SHE AS A MISERABLE AND RIDICULOUS VICTIM AND IDIOT WAS NEARLY AS DEEP IN DISGRACE AS THOSE SHAMELESS HARPIES THE LAKES'--SHE TOLD THE WHOLE TRUTH AS RESPECTED ALL PARTIES WITH HER SUPERB AND TRANQUIL FRANKNESS
IT IS MY DUTY SIR CAPTAIN LAKE'S SLENDER HAND SPRANG ON THE ATTORNEY'S COLLAR COAT AND WAISTCOAT TOGETHER AND HIS KNUCKLES HARD AND SHARP WERE SCREWED AGAINST MR LARKIN'S JAW-BONE AS HE SHOOK HIM AND HIS FACE WAS LIKE A DRIFT OF SNOW WITH TWO YELLOW FIRES GLARING IN IT
YOU KNOW HE'LL DIE SAID DORCAS PALE AND FIERCE
THE CARES OF THE WORLD--THE MISERIES OF WHAT THE WORLD CALLS DIFFICULTIES AND A STRUGGLE'--THESE WERE FOR THE POOR VICAR;--THE WORST TORTURE FOR AUGHT WE KNOW WHICH AN AVERAGE SOUL OUT OF HELL CAN ENDURE
THIS DEEP GULLY IN CHARACTER A GOOD DEAL RESEMBLES REDMAN'S GLEN INTO WHICH IT PASSES BEING FULLY AS DEEP AND WOODED TO THE SUMMIT AT BOTH SIDES BUT MUCH STEEPER AND NARROWER AND THEREFORE MANY SHADES DARKER
THE INSTINCT OF THE LONELY AND GLOOMY MAN UNCONSCIOUSLY DREW HIM TOWARDS THE LIGHT AND HE APPROACHED
THAT GOOD SIMPLE VICAR--HOW UNLIKE HIS BROTHER--IS WISER PERHAPS THAN ALL THE SHREWD PEOPLE THAT SMILE AT HIM
I AM TO KNOW NOTHING OF YOUR SECRETS
EVEN LARKIN HIS OWN LAWYER IS IN THE DARK
HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH--THE BROUGHAM WOULD BE AT THE DOOR TO TAKE MISS LAKE HOME IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
AND HE THOUGHT THAT THE HANDSOME GIRL LOOKED RATHER THIN AND PALE
OF COURSE MR WYLDER IF YOU SIR DESIRE ME TO LEAVE I SHALL INSTANTANEOUSLY DO SO
POSSIBLY'--SAID THE VICAR HIS EYES VERY WIDE OPEN AND LOOKING WITH A HESITATING GAZE FROM RACHEL TO THE ATTORNEY--'THERE MAY BE SOMETHING IN IT WHICH NEITHER YOU NOR I KNOW
BOTH SILENT
LARKIN'S NAME WAS ULTIMATELY STRUCK FROM THE ROLL OF SOLICITORS AND ATTORNEYS AND THERE WERE MINUTE AND MERCILESS ESSAYS IN THE PAPERS SURROUNDING HIS DISGRACE WITH A DREADFUL GLARE
IT MAY BE A FREAK OF HIS I DON'T THINK CAPTAIN LAKE THAT IS EXACTLY A POSSIBLE SOLUTION HERE
SECLUDED ONCE MORE--HIDDEN IN REDMAN'S DELL
WELL SAY I OUT OF MY LARGE ACQUAINTANCE THERE ARE NOT MANY MEN TO WHOM I WOULD GO FOR WISDOM
I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THE GIGANTIC SPECTRE WAS ABOUT TO RUSH UPON US IN AN ACCESS OF FRENZY
YOU MAY BE RESTORED TO ME SOON--MAYBE NEVER_--BUT TILL THEN I HAVE LOST YOU WELL SAID DORCAS IT MAY BE THERE IS A WILD KIND OF TRUTH IN WHAT YOU SAY RACHEL AND--NO MATTER--_TIME AS YOU SAY AND LIGHT_--I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU RACHEL
AND CHELFORD AND I TETE-A-TETE HAD A GLASS OF SHERRY AND WATER TOGETHER IN THE DRAWING-ROOM BEFORE PARTING
THE SHORTS GAITERS AND SMILE--A PHANTOM
THE FAINTLY-TRACED LINE ON WHICH THE VICAR WAS TO SIGN WAS NOW FAIRLY PRESENTED TO HIM
AND THEREFORE HIS NOT SEEING THE NOTE WAS A MERE ACCIDENT
WAITER ANOTHER PINT OF CHIAN
SHOW HIM TO THE DOOR SAID MISS LAKE
HUSH
WHEN I ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM AFTER DINNER LORD CHELFORD WAS PLAINLY ARGUING A POINT WITH THE YOUNG LADIES AND BY THE TIME I DREW NEAR IT WAS MISS LAKE'S TURN TO SPEAK
BUT KEEP THIS CLOSE
THANK YOU LITTLE MAN
I'VE BEEN FOR SOME WEEKS SO INSUFFERABLY BUSY AND HE LAID HIS WHITE HAND LIGHTLY OVER HIS EYES AS IF THEY AND THE BRAIN WITHIN WERE ALIKE WEARY
THE INEVITABLE MOUNTAIN WAS ALWAYS ON HIS SHOULDERS
AND I DO NOT YET KNOW WHICH FEELING IS THE JUSTER SURELY SHE IS WOMAN ENOUGH TO BE FUSSED A LITTLE ABOUT HER MARRIAGE OH DEAR NO
SHE MUST HAVE LEFT SOMETHING--A BAG OR A WHITE BASKET UPON THE WINDOW-SASH
I'M VERY SORRY INDEED
AND LISTEN SHE CONTINUED YOU MUST GO INTO MY ROOM AND BRING THE MESSAGE BACK AS IF FROM ME WITH MY LOVE TO MISS BRANDON
ONE HEAD BUSY
THE ENGROSSED DEEDS LAY IN THE BLACK BOX THERE
I DON'T KNOW WHEN WELL IT CERTAINLY IS VERY ODD AT ALL EVENTS IT HAD GLANCED UPON A SENSITIVE RECOLLECTION UNEXPECTEDLY
I TOLD YOU CHELFORD WOULD BE HERE SAID MISS BRANDON TO RACHEL IN A LOW TONE GLANCING AT THE YOUNG PEER
IN FACT MY DEAR MISS LAKE--IT IS AWFUL TO CONTEMPLATE--HE HAS BEEN IN THE HANDS OF SHARKS HARPIES MY DEAR MADAM
AND YOU KNOW MY OPINION ALL ALONG ABOUT THE FALLACY--YOU MUST EXCUSE ME SEEING ALL THE TROUBLE IT HAS INVOLVED YOU IN--THE INFATUATION OF HESITATING ABOUT THE SALE OF THAT MISERABLE REVERSION WHICH THEY COULD HAVE DISPOSED OF ON FAIR TERMS
IN HIS COAT-POCKET WERE FOUND OF COURSE IN NO VERY PRESENTABLE CONDITION HIS CIGAR-CASE HIS INITIALS STAMPED ON IT FOR MARK HAD IN HIS DAY A KEEN SENSE OF PROPERTY
AT THIS MOMENT HE HAD JUST EIGHT MINUTES MORE TO GO AND THE GLITTER OF THE PAIR OF EYES STARING BETWEEN THE MUFFLER AND THE RIM OF THE HAT MET HIS VIEW ONCE MORE
HIS BACK WAS TOWARD ME
AND I FEAR WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR EXTREME MEASURES UPON THEIR PART
THE CHOWSLEYS ARE UP TO SIX AND A-HALF I SEE HERE AND HE POINTED TO THE TIMES MR LARCOM'S FAT FACE SMILED IN SPITE OF HIS ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP IT UNDER
DON'T THINK I WAS SO HOT SINCE THE BALL AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE BY JOVE SIR IN 1828--AWFUL SUMMER THAT THE MAJOR WAS JERKING HIS HANDKERCHIEF UNDER HIS FLORID NOSE AND CHIN BY WAY OF VENTILATION
AND HE WAS SO FRIENDLY AND TALKED SO BEAUTIFULLY AND ALTHOUGH AS HE ADMITTED IN HIS LOFTY WAY THERE MIGHT BE DIFFERENCES IN FORTUNE AND POSITION YET WERE WE NOT ALL MEMBERS OF ONE BODY
THERE RADIE THERE SAID LAKE DISENGAGING HER FINGERS
WELL SHE IS CLEVER IN SOME RESPECTS
AND SHE LED HIM AGAIN INTO ACTION AND ACQUIRED DURING THE NEXT TEN MINUTES A GREAT DEAL OF CURIOUS LORE ABOUT SPANISH MULETEERS AND FRENCH PRISONERS TOGETHER WITH SOME PARTICULARS ABOUT THE NATURE OF PICKET DUTY AND THAT SCOUNDREL CASTANOS CHAPTER IV
SHE HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE AND LOOKING HALF OVER HER SHOULDER IN A LOW TONE INDICATING SURPRISE SHE MERELY SAID
IT WAS FINISHED HOWEVER AND HE WAS NOW READING IT OVER WITH CARE
THEY WERE STARING AT ONE ANOTHER ACROSS THE BED THE CAPTAIN IN HIS SHIRT
THERE WAS A SILENCE
THERE WAS A SILENCE
IT IS EASY TO FRIGHTEN HIM
I MUST LOOK A LITTLE LONGER AT THESE DIAMONDS AS LONG DEAR AS YOU PLEASE
IT WAS THAT OF A VERY TALL OLD MAN ENTIRELY DRESSED IN WHITE FLANNEL--A VERY LONG SPENCER AND SOME SORT OF WHITE SWATHING ABOUT HIS HEAD
AND THOSE PALTRY LITTLE EYES IN THEIR PINK SETTING THAT NEVERTHELESS FASCINATED HER LIKE THE GAZE OF A SERPENT
I CALLED OUT ONCE OR TWICE SHARPLY--'COME IN WHO'S THERE WHO'S THAT AND SO FORTH WITHOUT ANY SORT OF EFFECT EXCEPT THAT UNPLEASANT REACTION UPON THE NERVES WHICH FOLLOWS THE SOUND OF ONE'S OWN VOICE IN A SOLITUDE OF THIS KIND
EXCEPT FOR THE WAITERS AND THE ACTORS IN IT IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE SUPPER-ROOM WAS EMPTY DURING THIS SUDDEN FRACAS
HAD YOU BEEN THINKING OF HIM LATELY NOT A BIT MA'AM
THAT'S ALL IN A MOMENT MORE SHE SAT BESIDE HIM
TO RACHEL'S EYES THAT DISAPPEARING FORM LOOKED LIKE THE MOPING SPIRIT OF GUILT AND REGRET HAUNTING THE SCENE OF THE IRREVOCABLE
THE INTERIOR CORRESPONDED WITH THE ADDRESS AND THE LINES SLANTED CONFOUNDEDLY
YOU KNOW SIR JULIUS DON'T YOU VERY SLIGHTLY
SAY ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK TO-MORROW MORNING
THE FACT IS ONE DAY IN THIS CASE DOES NOT ANSWER AS WELL AS ANOTHER FOR I MUST HAVE DRAFTS OF THE DEEDS PREPARED BY MY CONVEYANCER IN TOWN AND THE NOTE IS INDISPENSABLE
WHERE IS THE LAGGARD SO DULL AS TO EXPERIENCE NO PLEASING FLUTTER AT HIS HEART IN ANTICIPATION OF MEETING A PERFECT BEAUTY IN A COUNTRY HOUSE
OF YOUR STAY IN LONDON I SAY NOTHING
THE ATTORNEY HAD HE ASKED HIMSELF THE QUESTION WHAT WAS HIS OBJECT IN THESE INQUISITIONS WOULD HAVE ANSWERED--'I AM DOING WHAT FEW OTHER MEN WOULD
HE HAD NOT BEEN TWO MINUTES IN HIS APARTMENT AGAIN WHEN HE ONCE MORE BEHELD THE FIGURE OF HIS MASTER CROSS THE WINDOW AND HEARD THE SMALL DOOR SOFTLY OPENED AND CLOSED AND THE BOLTS SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY DRAWN AGAIN INTO THEIR PLACES
YES DEAR--DELIGHTED
PERHAPS HE WAS RIGHT AND HE WAS AT ONCE ELATED AND PURIFIED AND HIS LOOKS AND MANNER THAT AFTERNOON WERE MORE THAN USUALLY MEEK AND CELESTIAL
THE GENTLEMAN SIR AS WAS TO AV MARRIED MISS BRANDON WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN WOMAN EJACULATED THE ATTORNEY HIS BACK TO THE FIRE STANDING ERECT AND A BLACK SHADOW OVER HIS AMAZED AND OFFENDED COUNTENANCE
NO DISTINCT IDEAS ABOUT IT POSSIBLY
THE GOOD ATTORNEY'S WEAKNESS WAS MONEY
AND YOU KNOW RADIE WE'RE NOT RICH ENOUGH--YOU AND I--TO SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE
THERE WERE THE BRANDON ARMS AND THE BRANDON QUARTERED WITH THE WYLDER
I THINK I'M GOING MAD AND SHE CONTINUED STARING AT HIM ALL THE TIME
BUT YOU CAN'T PAY IT AT PRESENT AND IT MAY BE HIGHLY IMPORTANT TO ENABLE YOU TO TREAT THIS AS A DEBT OF HONOUR YOU PERCEIVE
DORCAS--WHOM IF THE TRUTH WERE SPOKEN SHE WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE MET--ENCOUNTERED HER ON THE STEPS
JUST WAIT A BIT TILL I GET MY SLIPPERS ON
BUT IN THE MEANTIME I ASSURE YOU RACHEL YOU ARE DISPOSED TO BE VERY IMPERTINENT VERY IMPERTINENT
HAVE I BEEN TRUSTED
ABOUT A WORK WHICH I BEGAN THEN AND LAID ASIDE--ON EUSEBIUS
HAD HE KNOWLEDGE PUBLIC TALENTS TRAINING
HE REALLY BELIEVED SHE WAS A LITTLE--_EVER SO LITTLE--CRAZED
TOM WEALDON PULLED UP AT THE LITTLE WICKET
IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE JOS
IT IS GROWING TOO WINTRY FOR MAMMA NEAR THE SEA THOUGH I LIKE IT BETTER IN A HIGH WIND THAN IN A CALM
I'M NOT OF ANY REGIMENT NOW WHY YOU HAVE NOT SOLD OUT SHE FLUSHED AND SUDDENLY GREW PALE FOR SHE WAS AFRAID SOMETHING WORSE MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HAVING NO GREAT CONFIDENCE IN HER BROTHER
I CAN'T AFFORD A GUINEA
NO IT WAS A MISTAKE
ARRANGED I SUPPOSE BY LADY CHELFORD--NO GREAT DOT--AND AN UNAMIABLE FAMILY--AN ODIOUS FAMILY--NOTHING TO RECOMMEND HER BUT HER RANK SO RUMINATED RACHEL LAKE AS SHE LOOKED OUT ON HER SHADOWY GARDEN AND TAPPED A LITTLE FEVERISH TATTOO WITH HER FINGER ON THE WINDOW PANE
YOU WILL EASILY SEE HOW DIFFICULT IS MY POSITION
THROUGH THE STONE MULLIONS OF THE PROJECTING WINDOW AT THE RIGHT A FLUSH OF FIRE-LIGHT LOOKED PLEASANT AND HOSPITABLE AND ON THE THRESHOLD WERE STANDING LORD CHELFORD AND MY OLD FRIEND MARK WYLDER
SHE WAS STILL STANDING AT THE DOOR WITH HER HAND UPON THE BRASS HANDLE
IT IS NOT RADIE ALTOGETHER JEST
THIS MASTER OF PERSUASION WAS NOT AWARE THAT CAPTAIN LAKE WAS ARGUING THE QUESTION FOR HIMSELF ON TOTALLY DIFFERENT GROUNDS AND THAT IT WAS FIXED IN HIS MIND PRETTY MUCH IN THESE TERMS THAT OLD VILLAIN WANTS AN EXORBITANT BRIBE--IS HE WORTH IT HE KNEW WHAT THE LAWYER THOUGHT HE DID NOT KNOW--THAT FIVE OAKS WAS HELD BY THE LAWYERS TO BE POSSIBLY WITHOUT THOSE UNFORTUNATE LIMITATIONS WHICH AFFECTED ALL THE REST OF THE ESTATE
PERHAPS SAID THE VICAR BRIGHTENING UP SUDDENLY AND LOOKING IN THE ATTORNEY'S EYES FOR ANSWER PERHAPS SOMETHING MIGHT BE DONE WITH THE REVERSION AS A SECURITY TO BORROW A SUFFICIENT SUM WITHOUT SELLING THE ATTORNEY SHOOK HIS HIGH HEAD AND WHISKERS GRAY AND FOXY AND MEDITATED WITH THE SEAL OF HIS PENCIL CASE BETWEEN HIS LIPS
HE TOLD STANLEY THAT HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP DORCAS BUT THAT HE LAKE MUST FIGHT HIM AND GO TO BOULOGNE FOR THE PURPOSE AND THEY SHOULD ARRANGE MATTERS SO THAT ONE OR OTHER MUST FALL
HE'S NOT A MAN I CAN TELL YOU WHEREVER HE IS TO BE BULLIED NO MORE THAN I AM
WILLIAM HAD UNDOUBTEDLY THE REVERSION OF THE ESTATE
I SEE YOU DO REMEMBER THAT NIGHT--_AS WELL YOU MAY MISS LAKE HE EJACULATED IN FORMIDABLE TONES AND WITH A SHAKE OF HIS BALD HEAD
SUITABILITY OF CLIMATE FOR WE HAVE SUN AND SHADE HERE SUCCESSION OF BLOOM AND CONTRAST OF COLOUR AND EVER SO MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS I CAN QUITE IMAGINE IT THOUGH IT DID NOT STRIKE ME BEFORE HE SAID LOOKING ON HER WITH A SMILE OF PLEASANT AND PECULIAR INTEREST WHICH SOMEHOW GAVE A REALITY TO THIS PLAYFUL TALK
ABOUT THE SAME TIME--WHILE MR JOS
AND IT IS NOT FOR NOTHING BE VERY SURE THAT I AM RUNNING THIS QUEER RIG MASQUERADING HIDING AND DODGING LIKE A RUNAWAY FORGER WHICH IS NOT PLEASANT ANYWAY AND IF YOU DOUBT IT ONLY TRY
THE LITTLE STREET OF GYLINGDEN THROUGH WHICH THEY WERE PASSING LOOKED STRANGE AND DREAM-LIKE
BUT YOU KNOW I SEE WITH THE WILD EYES OF THE BRANDONS I AM GRATEFUL DORCAS THAT YOU DON'T HATE ME
HE CELEBRATED HIS LAST GREAT DEFEAT WITH A PIC-NIC IN THE ROMANTIC SCENERY OF NOLTON WHERE HE AND HIS COMRADES IN DISASTER HAD A ROARING EVENING AND NO END OF CHAFF WHEN HE AND JOS
WHAT CAN HE GAIN FROM CHILDREN'S TALK
SO MR LARKIN I HAVE QUITE MADE UP MY MIND
I HOPE STANLEY DOES NOT INTEND TRYING TO EXTRACT MONEY FROM HIM
NO GOOD STORY--HEY
IN WHICH WE GO TO THE DRAWING-ROOM AND THE PARTY BREAKS UP
WHY SHOULD THEY BOTH OBJECT MERELY TO RECEIVE AND FUND HIS MONEY
AND WITH THE SAME SAD SMILE HE LOOKED ROUND ON THE FIGURES SOME MARBLE SOME PAINTED STONE OF DEPARTED BRANDONS AND WYLDERS WITH GARRULOUS EPITAPHS WHO SURROUNDED THEM IN VARIOUS COSTUMES QUITE A FAMILY GROUP IN WHICH THE ATTORNEY WAS GRATIFIED TO MINGLE
BUT DARK AS IT WAS THERE WAS STILL LIGHT ENOUGH TO ENABLE RACHEL AS SHE HURRIED ACROSS THE LITTLE GARDEN ON HER RETURN FROM BRANDON TO SEE A LONG WHITE FACE AND SOME DIM OUTLINE OF THE FIGURE TO WHICH IT BELONGED LOOKING OUT UPON HER FROM THE WINDOW OF HER LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM
I SUSPECT THERE ARE VERY FEW MERE HYPOCRITES ON EARTH
IT IS BY TRUTH HE GLANCED ASIDE AT THE TARN WHERE I HAD SEEN THE PHANTOM AND BY WHICH THEIR PATH NOW LED THEM--'YOU REMEMBER PARNELL'S PRETTY IMAGE
HE DOES NOT STICK AT TRIFLES MASTER STANLEY
AND RACHEL SAID--'WELL YOU MUST NOT THINK OF SELLING YOUR REVERSION
WHEN I DID I AM NOT ASHAMED TO CONFESS IT WAS TO PLUNGE MY HEAD UNDER THE BED-CLOTHES WITH THE CHILDISH INSTINCT OF TERROR
I WAS GROWING MOST UNCOMFORTABLY LIKE ONE OF MRS ANNE RADCLIFFE'S HEROES--A NERVOUS RACE OF DEMIGODS
THE ATTORNEY MUST RUN UP TO LONDON FOR A DAY OR TWO
AND THOUGHT HE WAS MAKING JUST THE INTERESTING IMPRESSION HE MEDITATED
I OF COURSE KNEW NOTHING OF IT UNTIL HE HAD BEEN MORE THAN AN HOUR UPON HIS JOURNEY RACHEL LAKE MADE NO ANSWER BUT A LITTLE LAUGH
SHE WAS THIN THEN BUT SHE HAS PLUMPED OUT A BIT AND IMPROVED EVERY WAY WHATEVER ELSE HE WAS MARK WAS CERTAINLY NO BEAUTY;--A LITTLE SHORT HE WAS AND RATHER SQUARE--ONE SHOULDER A THOUGHT HIGHER THAN THE OTHER--AND A SLIGHT ENERGETIC HITCH IN IT WHEN HE WALKED
SHE SEEMED TO LIKE THOSE LINGERING SENTENCES--AND HUNG UPON THEM--AND EVEN SMILED BUT IN HER EYES THERE WAS A VAGUE AND MELANCHOLY PLEADING--A WANDERING AND UNFATHOMABLE LOOK THAT PAINED HIM
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME DORCAS HAD SEEN STANLEY LAKE'S FEATURES IN THAT TRANSLATED STATE WHICH INDICATED THE ACTION OF HIS EVIL NATURE AND THE APPARITION HAUNTED HER FOR MANY A DAY AND NIGHT
JIM DUTTON'S LETTER HAD SOMEHOW AN AIR OF SOBRIETY AND EARNESTNESS WHICH MADE WAY WITH HIS CONVICTIONS
THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION SAID LAKE WHO NEVERTHELESS APPEARED STRANGELY UNEASY
BUT THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN RESENTED IT AND BROODED OVER IT EVERY NOW AND THEN WHEN THE PALE FACE OF THE CAPTAIN CROSSED HIS EYE
HOW IS RACHEL
HE'S STAYING HERE WITH ME YOU ARE AWARE ON A VISIT
AND THEN LOOKED OUT ON THE LAMPLIT PLATFORM AND SAW THE OFFICIALS LOITERING OFF TO THE CLANG OF THE CARRIAGE DOORS
HOW MARK WYLDER'S DISAPPEARANCE AFFECTED HIS FRIENDS
A FIGURE WHICH HAD LOST ITS ENERGY--A FACE STAMPED WITH THE LINES AND PALLOR OF A DEJECTION ALMOST GUILTY--WITH SOMETHING OF THE FALLEN GRACE AND BEAUTY OF POOR MARGARET AS WE SEE HER WITH HER FOREHEAD LEANING ON HER SLENDER HAND BY THE STIRLESS SPINNING-WHEEL--THE IMAGE OF A STRANGE AND INEFFACEABLE SORROW SAT RACHEL LAKE
YOU CAN'T HAVE A NOTION--NO ONE HAS--WHAT IT IS I SEE INDEED MURMURED THE HONEST VICAR IN A COMPASSIONATING TONE AND QUITE ENTERING INTO THE SPIRIT OF MR LARKIN'S MOURNFUL APPEAL AS IF THE BEING IN LARGE BUSINESS WAS THE MOST DISTRESSING SITUATION IN WHICH AN ATTORNEY COULD WELL FIND HIMSELF
BUT INDEED IF I WERE CAPABLE AT THIS MOMENT I SHOULD NOT FAIL TO SEE HER POOR CREATURE THERE WAS SOMETHING APOLOGETIC AND ALMOST MISERABLE IN HIS LOOK AS HE SAID THIS
HOW QUICKLY AND STRIKINGLY SICKNESS TELLS UPON CHILDREN
AND AS TO MY EVER AGAIN ACTING AS HIS TRUSTEE;--THOUGH YES I FORGOT'--HE MADE A SUDDEN PAUSE AND WAS LOST FOR A MINUTE IN ANNOYED REFLECTION--'YES I MUST FOR A WHILE
THE UNIVERSAL INSTINCT HONOURS BEAUTY
SUPPOSE WE HAVE TEA IN THE TAPESTRY ROOM THE DUTCH ROOM STANLEY--I THINK SO--I SHOULD LIKE IT VERY WELL
HERE IT IS IT WAS A SCRAP PENCILLED ON THE BACK OF A LETTER LUKE WAGGOT PUT THE HORSE TO AND DRIVE THE DOG-CART TO THE WHITE HOUSE LOOK OUT FOR ME THERE
IN THE CORNER
BUT MATTERS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW NOW AND THE VISCOUNT WHO IS A VERY SENSIBLE FELLOW IN THE MAIN SAW IT AT ONCE
I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT MR LARKIN HAS BEEN DOING
AND ESPECIALLY DIRECTING THAT IN THE EVENT OF ALIENATING THE ESTATE THE SAID DORCAS MUST BE MADE AN ASSENTING PARTY TO THE DEED
THE INVESTIGATION WAS A SORT OF SCIENTIFIC RECREATION TO HIM AND SOMETHING MORE
ALL THESE FANCIFUL QUERIES FLITTED THROUGH HIS BRAIN AS THE VICAR'S HANDS SHOOK BOTH HIS AND HE LABOURED HARD TO MAINTAIN THE CHEERFUL GRIN WITH WHICH HE RECEIVED THE NEWS AND HIS GUILEFUL RAPACIOUS LITTLE EYES SEARCHED NARROWLY THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS CLIENT
I DON'T STAY LONG ANYWHERE AND DON'T CARRY MY OWN NAME--AND NEVER ASK FOR LETTERS AT THE POST
AFTER THE BALL
ALL I CAN TELL YOU STANLEY IS THIS THAT IF I WERE A MAN AND AN ATTEMPT MADE TO EXTORT FROM ME ANY SORT OF CONCESSION BY TERROR I WOULD SHOOT THE MISCREANT WHO MADE IT THROUGH THE HEAD LIKE A HIGHWAYMAN WHAT THE DEVIL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT SAID HE
HE HAD NO LACK OF CUNNING AND A CONVENIENT FUND OF COOL CRUELTY WHEN THAT STOICAL ATTRIBUTE WAS CALLED FOR
WRITE TO SOME GOOD ATTORNEY IN LONDON
I TELL YOU I WON'T MORTGAGE AND YOU SHALL SELL THIS SIR IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE BEEN SPOKEN TO IN SUCH TERMS AND WHY DO YOU CONTRADICT AND THWART ME UPON BUSINESS OF WHICH I KNOW SOMETHING AND YOU NOTHING
HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH LITTLE FAIRY--NOT AT ALL SATISFIED
AND HE STOOPED WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST MOTION OVER THE FIRE-PLACE IN THE ATTITUDE I HAVE DESCRIBED
OF GYLINGDEN OPERATED MOST SUCCESSFULLY ON SATURDAY LAST AND WE ARE HAPPY TO SAY THE GALLANT PATIENT HAS SINCE BEEN GOING ON AS FAVOURABLY AS COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED
THERE CAN BE NO OBJECTION OF COURSE TO YOUR READING IT
HE TURNED TO HIS LEFT WALKING DOWN TOWARDS THE TOWN AND THE INNOCENT GREEN TREES HID HIM QUICKLY AND THE GUSH AND TINKLE OF THE CLEAR BROOK ROSE FAINT AND PLEASANTLY THROUGH THE LEAVES FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE GLEN AND REFRESHED HER EAR AFTER HIS UNPLEASANT TALK
OR NO I COULD NOT TRUST YOU
UPON MY HONOUR I NEVER CAN RACHEL SHUDDERED AS THE DOOR OPENED AND THERE WAS A GHASTLY SORT OF EXPECTATION IN HER LOOK
ONLY I DON'T THINK SHE'S QUITE SO DULL AND APATHETIC AS I AT FIRST SUPPOSED
WHAT'S THAT HORRID WORK OF ART AGAINST THE WALL A SHELL-WORK CABINET DEAR
IT WOULD NOT DO FOR THE BUTLER TO BE TAKEN OR EVEN SEEN BY LAKE NOR YET TO BE LEFT AT THE OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR AND BARRED OUT
WHEN LORD CHELFORD JOINED US I PERCEIVED THAT WYLDER WAS IN THE ROOM AND SAW A VERY CORDIAL GREETING BETWEEN HIM AND LAKE
WHAT PRODIGIES MIGHT IT NOT ACCOMPLISH FOR ITS HAPPY POSSESSOR IF ONLY HE COULD READ IT ARIGHT AND COMMAND THE SPIRITS WHICH ITS SPELLS MIGHT CALL UP BEFORE HIM
PERHAPS OTHERS WERE THINKING THE SAME OF RACHEL
IT WAS THE RECEIPT OF A FOREIGN LETTER OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXACT COPY VENICE
SO HE LOOKED THAT WAY TOO
THEIR VISION IS FORMED FOR DARKNESS AND LIGHT BLINDS THEM
MR LARKIN
HARM
SO LUKE CAME FORTH
IF THE TENDER MERCIES OF THE WICKED ARE CRUEL SO ARE THE ELEGANCES OF A VULGAR MAN
IF HE WERE LIKE LORD CHELFORD OR EVEN LIKE OUR GOOD VICAR--NOT IN PIETY FOR POOR STANLEY'S TRAINING LIKE MY OWN WAS SADLY NEGLECTED THERE--I MEAN IN A FEW MANLY POINTS OF CHARACTER I SHOULD BE QUITE HAPPY I THINK IN MY SOLITARY NOOK IS HE SO VERY ODD SAID MISS BRANDON COLDLY
INDEED IT IS RADIE
AND MR LARKIN OF COURSE MADE THE BEST TERMS HE COULD
MR WYLDER VERY WELL KNOWS WITH WHAT RELUCTANCE I TOUCHED THE CASE--A NASTY CASE
AND WHEN ABOUT TO DESCEND A SORT OF PANIC AND INSURMOUNTABLE DISGUST SEIZED HIM
BRIGHT AND NATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING-GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH HIS BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF HIS CAGE
I WISH VERY MUCH I COULD SEE YOU ALL THE WAY BUT THERE'S A RISK IN IT YOU KNOW
AND WHEN WAPSIE WAS MENTIONED SOMETIMES THE VICAR'S EYES FILLED BUT HE SMILED THROUGH THIS WITH A KIND OF GLADNESS AT THE CHILD'S AFFECTION
THE ROAD MAKES A LONG AND EASY DESCENT INTO THE LITTLE TOWN OF GYLINGDEN AND DOWN THIS WE WERE GOING AT AN EXHILARATING PACE AND THE JINGLE OF THE VEHICLE SOUNDED LIKE SLEDGE-BELLS IN MY EARS AND ITS SWAYING AND JERKING WERE PLEASANT AND LIFE-LIKE
AND I DID NOT WANT A COLLISION WITH MR LARKIN EITHER
CAPTAIN LAKE LOOKED PEEVISH AND DANGEROUS AS HE ALWAYS DID WHEN HE WAS ANXIOUS
AND SHE LIKES ME THOUGH SHE'S ODD AND DON'T SHOW IT THE WAY OTHER GIRLS WOULD
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH EVERYONE WAS CONSPIRING TO PERPLEX AND TORMENT HIM
THERE ARE FLOWERS AS WE SEE AND TWO OR THREE CORRESPONDENTS AND WALKS INTO THE VILLAGE
AND SOMETIMES WINKING WITH A HORRID WILY GRIMACE AT STANLEY WHO FERVENTLY WISHED HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TARN
THE ESTATES WERE BACK AGAIN WITH THE WYLDERS
AS THE ATTORNEY MARCHED LEISURELY ONWARD HE SAW OR FANCIED THAT HE SAW NOW AND THEN IN UNCERTAIN GLIMPSES SOMETHING WHITE IN MOTION AMONG THE TREES BESIDE HIM
IT MUST BE SOME BAD SECRET
AND WHO WAS THIS LITTLE MRS WILLIAM WYLDER WHO CAME IN SO HOMELY OF FEATURE SO RADIANT OF GOODHUMOUR SO EAGER AND SIMPLE IN A VERY PLAIN DRESS--A BRANDON HOUSEMAID WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SEEN IN IT LEANING SO PLEASANTLY ON HIS LEAN LONG CLERICAL ARM--MADE FOR REACHING BOOKS DOWN FROM HIGH SHELVES A LANK SCHOLARLIKE LIMB WITH A SOMEWHAT THREADBARE CUFF--AND WHO LOOKED ROUND WITH THAT ANTICIPATION OF PLEASURE AND THAT SIMPLE CONFIDENCE IN A REAL WELCOME WHICH ARE SO LIKELY TO INSURE IT
SHE TURNED INTO THE LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM AT THE LEFT AND HERSELF UNSEEN DID TAKE THAT LAST LOOK AND SAW HIM GO UP THE ROAD AGAIN TOWARDS BRANDON
CHAPTER XXVIII
AND PERHAPS YOUR MEETING MAY STILL BE IN TIME
A LIEUTENANT--AND THERE LIKELY TO STICK ALL MY DAYS
I AM NOT SURE THAT LAWYER LARKIN DID NOT OFTEN THINK HIMSELF VERY NEARLY WHAT HE WISHED THE WORLD TO THINK HIM--AN EMINENT CHRISTIAN WHAT AN AWFUL ABYSS IS SELF DELUSION
I HAVE REASONS FOR EVERYTHING WHICH YOU MAY GUESS I DARE SAY BEING A SHARP CHAP
AND WITH THE WINTER'S SNOW WE'LL VANISH FROM BRANDON AND APPEAR WITH THE EARLY FLOWERS AT OUR COTTAGE AMONG THE BEAUTIFUL WOODS AND HILLS OF WALES
HE HAD EITHER GROWN COARSER A GREAT DEAL OR I MORE DECENT DURING OUR SEPARATION
I'M NOT WELL YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR PROMISE
IT WAS A SUNNY DAY AND THE AIR STILL
PERHAPS IN COMPARISON HIS TRIAL IS IN SOME SORT A BLESSING
BUT YOU MAY BE IN ERROR RESPECTING MR WYLDER
AND OLD TAMAR GOT UP BEFORE HER WITH HER SCARED SECRET LOOK CLOTHED IN WHITE--THE WITCH WHOSE WORD HAD CHANGED ALL AND SUMMONED ROUND HER THOSE SHAPES WHICH THREW THEIR INDISTINCT SHADOWS ON THE WALLS AND FACES AROUND
I'VE HEARD IT ALL--I HEARD YOU AND MISS RADIE SPEAK ON THE NIGHT YOU FIRST CAME TO SEE HER AFTER YOUR SICKNESS
NOT THAT I NEED CARE MORE THAN DORCAS OR ANYONE ELSE
THE INVALUABLE WEALDON HAD RUN THROUGH THE LIST OF HIS TO-MORROW'S VISITS AND GIVEN HIM AN INKLING OF THE IDIOSYNCRASIES THE FEUDS AND THE LIKINGS OF EACH ELECTOR IN THE CATALOGUE
NO YOU SHA'N'T BE LOST IF I CAN HELP IT RACHEL SHOOK HER HEAD AS SHE SPOKE WITH A BITTER SMILE AND A DREADFUL SIGH
AND HE KEPT ME WALKING BACK AND FORWARD NEAR THE MILL-ROAD A PRECIOUS LONG TIME
THERE ARE SOME MEN THAT CAN ONLY REALLY LOVE ONCE IN THEIR LIVES AND NEVER FORGET THEIR FIRST LOVE I ASSURE YOU WYLDER MURMURED ALL THIS AND LOOKED AS PLAINTIVE AS HE COULD WITHOUT EXCITING THE ATTENTION OF THE PEOPLE OVER-THE-WAY
THE END WAS THAT HE PURCHASED A RESPITE OF THREE MONTHS BY ADDING THIRTY POUNDS TO HIS DEBT AND SO WAS THANKFUL FOR ANOTHER DELIVERANCE AND WAS CONFIDENT OF THE PROMISED SUBSIDY WITHIN A WEEK OR AT ALL EVENTS A FORTNIGHT OR AT WORST THREE MONTHS WAS A LONG REPRIEVE--AND THE SUBSIDY MUST ARRIVE BEFORE THE EMERGENCY
THERE WAS NO SHADOW OF SELF-REPROACH TO SLUR THE SUNNY LANDSCAPE
FOR WHEN THAT PLEASED AND COMMUNICATIVE HOST HAD WITHDRAWN JOS
BUT HIS ADVERTISEMENTS FOR A RESIDENT PUPIL HAD NOT BEEN ANSWERED
IN FACT IT IS IDLE TO SAY THAT BEING UNACCUSTOMED TO THE GRAND SCALE ON WHICH LAW COSTS PRESENT THEMSELVES ON OCCASION HE WAS UNSPEAKABLY SHOCKED AND HE GREW VERY PALE AND SILENT ON HEARING THESE IMPRESSIVE SENTENCES
IF I MIGHT VENTURE TO SUGGEST I REALLY THINK A PEREMPTORY ALTERNATIVE SHOULD BE PRESENTED TO HIM
YOU MAY PLOT YOUR WICKEDNESS OR MAKE YOUR CONFESSION OR POP THE QUESTION AND NOT A SOUL BUT YOUR CONFIDANT BE A BIT THE WISER--PROVIDED ONLY YOU COMMAND YOUR COUNTENANCE
ALL QUITE WELL EVER SINCE
I DARE SAY SAID WYLDER WITH A SNEER HE WAS ASKING AFFECTIONATELY FOR ME EH NO
WHAT A DAZZLING PROSPECT IT OPENED FOR STANLEY
YES MASTER MARK COULD NOT HURT ME
DORCAS PAUSED UPON THE DOOR-STEPS AND RECEIVED HER SISTER-IN-LAW UPON THAT ELEVATION
HE HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE TO SEE HIM IN ONE OF HIS VIOLENT MOODS AND FANCIED THAT HIS APATHETIC MANNER INDICATED A PERSON MORE EASILY BULLIED
AND NOW THEY SAY MARK WYLDER IS MARRIED AND HAS CHILDREN
THEY MAKE THEIR RECOVERIES ALL IN A MOMENT BUT HE DOES NOT LOOK WORSE SAID THE VICAR LIFTING HIS EYES EAGERLY FROM HIS BOOT WHICH HE WAS BUTTONING ON THE CHAIR
AND STANLEY BEING A WIDEAWAKE AND VIOLENT PERSON AND HIS MEASURES SHARP AND RECKLESS MR LARCOM CHERISHED A NERVOUS RESPECT FOR HIM
AND MAYBE IT WOULD NOT BE AMISS IF YOU GAVE HIM A HINT TOM WEALDON INDEED WAS A GOOD-NATURED FELLOW
I'LL LOOK IN UPON YOU BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE IN THE MORNING AND I'LL SAY YES OR NO THEN SAID THE CAPTAIN AS THEY PARTED UNDER THE OLD STONE PORCH THE ATTORNEY WITH A GRACEFUL INCLINATION A SAD SMILE AND A WAVE OF HIS HAND--THE CAPTAIN WITH HIS HANDS IN THE POCKETS OF HIS LOOSE COAT AND A SIDELONG GLANCE FROM HIS YELLOW EYES
THE FAULT IS IN CIRCUMSTANCES
YES REALLY
IT IS NO PART OF YOUR DUTY TO TELL THE WORLD WHAT CAN'T POSSIBLY CONCERN THEM AND MAY BRING YOUR YOUNG MISTRESS TO--_PERDITION
HE IS NOT ONLY NO GENTLEMAN BUT NO MAN--A COWARD AS WELL AS A RUFFIAN
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE TRUSTED ME AS I DID YOU IT IS AN ANTIPATHY--AN ANTIPATHY I CANNOT GET OVER DEAR DORCAS
AND SO HE WALKED DOWN TO PRETTY LITTLE GYLINGDEN
AND I SHOWED IT TO A CLEVER FELLOW AT MALTA--A MISSIONARY CHAP--AND HE READ IT OFF SLICK AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS
BUT HIS AUDACIOUS ENERGY HITHERTO HAD EXTRICATED HIM
THEY SENT THE NOTICE FOR YOU HERE
DORCAS MUST KNOW THE TRUTH THAT THERE IS A SECRET JEALOUSLY GUARDED FROM HER SHE DOES KNOW--NO WOMAN COULD FAIL TO PERCEIVE THAT
AND BEGGING OF HIM TO MAKE A DISCLOSURE--DISCLOSURE OF WHAT
NOW STANLEY LAKE HAD PERHAPS EXPECTED TO SEE SOME ONE ELSE
HOW CAN YOU GO ON WITH IT COME TAMAR WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME
BUT HE KNEW NOTHING
FROM MOTHER TO CHILD FROM CHILD TO GRANDCHILD THE SAME INFLUENCE CONTINUES
THEN AT LENGTH HE RECOLLECTED THAT MR LARKIN WAS WAITING IN THE STUDY
DELIGHTFUL SENTIMENT THE GRATITUDE OF A RIGHTEOUS MAN
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED IT MOST CAREFULLY SAID STANLEY QUIETLY
MY DEARS WHAT'S ALL THIS
I'M GROWN BROWN AND GREAT WHISKERS
DON'T LET HIM--DON'T LET HIM
WON'T YOU EXCUSE ME BUT PRAY DO
BUT WHAT WAS THIS LITTLE TIP FROM FORTUNE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID PIECES OF SCRIVENERY IN HIS DESPATCH BOX
BUSINESS I VENTURE TO SAY AND HE WENT INTO THAT ELECTIONEERING WITHOUT EVER MENTIONING IT EITHER SO THOUGHT LARKIN AND HE DID NOT LIKE THIS
JIM HAD BEEN SPINNING THEORIES ABOUT THE REASONS OF HIS MYSTERIOUS THOUGH VERY AGREEABLE OCCUPATION AND ANNOUNCED THEM BROADLY IN HIS LETTER TO LARKIN
I AM SURE LARKIN DID NOT HIMSELF SUPPOSE THIS
RADIE KISS ME NEXT MORNING BEFORE EARLY FAMILY PRAYERS WHILE MR JOS
1679 AND THE WYLDER ARMS AND THE ETERNAL RESURGAM PROJECTING OVER ITS DOOR
YOU SEE MR WYLDER I RELIED IN FACT ALTOGETHER UPON THIS A--ARRANGEMENT
THE WILDEST OF ALL LARK'S QUESTIONS REFERS TO WYLDER'S PLACE OF ABODE WHICH SIR J
THEY HAD NEVER GROWN OLD IN ONE ANOTHER'S FOND EYES
BUT THE WORDS ARE PRECISE--HONOUR AND OBEY--AND OBEY YOU MUST
THE BEST THING FOR BOTH WAS PERHAPS THAT THE ONE SHOULD SELL AND THE OTHER BUY THE REVERSION
BUT HOW CAN YOU SHOW IT SAID LAKE WITH A SLIGHT YAWN
I DON'T THINK HE HAD ANY DEFINITE MOTIVE IN DOING THIS BUT SOMETHING STRUCK HIM THAT HE HAD NOT REMARKED BEFORE
AND I SHALL WRITE TO CHELFORD AS MY TRUSTEE TO COME HERE TO ADVISE ME AND I SNAP MY FINGERS AT YOU BOTH AND MEET YOU WITH DEFIANCE AND STANLEY'S SINGULAR EYES GLARED UPON HER FOR A FEW SECONDS
THE LOOK WAS ORACULAR AND PAINFUL
I HAD A FOREBODING OF EVIL THE MOMENT I SAW HIM--BEFORE THE POOR LITTLE MAN WAS PUT TO HIS BED DORCAS RANG THE BELL
I FORGIVE YOU
BUT IT DID NOT APPEAR
WE KNOW HE HAD IMAGINED FOR HIMSELF SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION ON THIS BEHALF AND CHERISHED A SECRET TENDRE FOR THE SAME REVERSION
HIS JUSTICE BEING WHAT
THAT'S A POINT
AND THEN LISTENED AS STILL AS A MOUSE
NO MORE MISS
WHAT EXACTLY HE HAD DONE TO DISOBLIGE THEM HE COULD NOT BRING TO MIND
THEN HEREBUS
THE HAND WAS DORCAS'S--AND LORD CHELFORD JUMPED INTO THE LITTLE PONY CARRIAGE WHICH AWAITED HIM AT THE DOOR OF THE SILVER LION WHEN HE REACHED REDMAN'S FARM CAPTAIN LAKE COULD NOT EXERT HIMSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO SPEAK FOR NEARLY HALF-AN-HOUR
ON THE LAST OCCASION HOWEVER HE SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING HIM IN VIEW AND CAME UP WITH HIM IN A COURT WHEN HE WAS REWARDED WITH A SIGHT OF SUCH A FACE AS CAUSED HIM TO FALL TO THE GROUND IN A FIT
THE CONSTANT BUSTLE WAS INJURIOUS TO HIS PATIENT
I NEVER LAUGHED SO MUCH I DON'T THINK IN THE SAME TIME BEFORE OR SINCE
IN FACT HE RATHER LIKED IT PROVIDED HE WAS ADMITTED TO CONFIDENCE
SAY YOUR PRAYERS WHEN I GO OUT AND COME HERE NO MORE HE PAUSED AS IF THESE INCREDIBLE WORDS WERE TO SINK INTO MY MEMORY
I AM NOT VERY HAPPY
SOME HAD NOT SEEN ANY AND OTHERS ONLY A BIT OF IT BEING BUSY WITH PLATES AND ICE-TUBS
THERE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING PLAYFUL IN DORCAS'S LOOK
AS I LOOKED THROUGH THE CHAISE-WINDOWS EVERY MOMENT PRESENTED SOME GROUP OR OUTLINE OR HOMELY OBJECT FOR YEARS FORGOTTEN
BUT YOU ARE NOT TO GO TO THE BRANDON ARMS--YOU GOT MY NOTE DIDN'T YOU I HAD AND HAD COME DIRECT TO THE HALL IN CONSEQUENCE
BUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A CONJUNCTION MIGHT WELL DISMAY HIM
I AM SOMETIMES AT THE BRINK OF DESPAIR TAKE COMFORT FROM THOSE FEARS
I AGREE WITH YOU--WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO LADY CHELFORD--THAT IS HER SON LORD CHELFORD OH SAID BUTTLE WHOSE SMIRK VANISHED ON THE INSTANT IN A VERY RED AND DISMAL VACANCY I--I'M AFRAID HE'LL THINK ME SHOCKINGLY RUDE AND IN A MINUTE MORE BUTTLE WAS GONE
POOR DOLLY
YOU ARE FRIGHTENED NOT MUCH FRIGHTENED STANLEY SHE WHISPERED
SO THE CAPTAIN HAD HARDLY COMMENCED HIS HOMEWARD WALK WHEN LARCOM THOUGH NO GREAT RUNNER THREW HIMSELF INTO AN AGITATED AMBLE AND REACHED AND ENTERED THE LITTLE DOOR JUST IN TIME TO ESCAPE OBSERVATION
NO HE DOES NOT LIKE ME_--THAT IS--I DON'T KNOW
THE OLD RECTOR HAD LONG PASSED AWAY
NO DORCAS NO
CONSERVATORY LVII.--CONCERNING A NEW DANGER WHICH THREATENED CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE LVIII.--MISS RACHEL LAKE BECOMES VIOLENT LIX.--AN ENEMY IN REDMAN'S DELL LX.--RACHEL LAKE BEFORE THE ACCUSER LXI.--IN WHICH DAME DUTTON IS VISITED LXII.--THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINS WHY MARK WYLDER ABSCONDED LXIII.--THE ACE OF HEARTS LXIV.--IN THE DUTCH ROOM LXV.--I REVISIT BRANDON HALL LXVI.--LADY MACBETH LXVII.--MR
I DON'T KNOW WHERE LAKE IS STAYING
RACHEL AND DORCAS WERE SITTING IN THE ROOM WITH HIM--NOT EXPECTING THE CATASTROPHE THEN
I CAN'T COMPREHEND YOU--YOU FRIGHTEN ME STANLEY
FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES
AND AS THAT GENTLEMAN PENNED A RECEIPT THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED--HIS EYES LOWERED TO THE LITTLE VELLUM-BOUND BOOK IN WHICH HE WAS NOW MAKING AN ENTRY YOU HAVE HANDED ME A LARGE SUM MR LARKIN--3,276_L 11_S 4_D I UNDERTOOK THIS YOU KNOW ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WAS NOT TO GO ON VERY LONG
THAT WILL DO SAID HE GLOWERING FURIOUSLY AT LAKE WHO CONFRONTED HIM IN THE SAME ATTITUDE A COUPLE OF YARDS AWAY
I HAVE LEFT NOTES FOR HIM WHEREVER HE IS LIKELY TO CALL ENTREATING AN INTERVIEW
THE NIGHT WAS VERY STILL--A SHARP NIGHT WITH A THIN MOON LIKE A SCIMITAR HANGING BRIGHT IN THE SKY AND A MYRIAD OF INTENSE STARS BLINKING IN THE HEAVENS ABOVE THE STEEP ROOFS AND SPIRAL CHIMNEYS OF BRANDON HALL AND THE ANCIENT TREES THAT SURROUNDED IT
I KNOW NOTHING OF YOUR DOINGS STANLEY--HEAVEN FORBID
I'LL GET AWAY
SHE EVEN ACCOMPANIED HIM AS FAR AS THE TOP OF THE RUDE FLIGHT OF STEPS I HAVE MENTIONED SO OFTEN AND THERE AWAITED HIS RETURN--THE CONDITION IMPOSED BY HIS COWARDICE--AND MADE MORE DREADFUL BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY HAD HEARD RETREATING FOOTSTEPS ALONG THE WALK AND STANLEY SAW THE TALL FIGURE OF UNCLE JULIUS OR LORNE AS HE CALLED HIMSELF TURNING THE FAR CORNER
HE CHUCKLED OVER THE LITTLE MAN'S BED
I WONDER WHETHER SHE HEARD US
HE OWED HIM COSTS AND BESIDE COSTS ALSO TO BURLINGTON SMITH AND CO
HE MUST RETURN SOON AND I CAN'T WELL REFUSE TO ACT UNTIL AT LEAST SOME OTHER ARRANGEMENT IS MADE
FIGURES CUT IN STONE AND PAINTED AND GILDED IN TARNISHED SPLENDOUR ACCORDING TO THE GORGEOUS BARBARISM OF ELIZABETH'S AND THE FIRST JAMES'S AGE
IT CAN'T LAST VERY LONG
WHY HE CAN'T HAVE L300 A YEAR CLEAR FROM THAT LITTLE PROPERTY IN DEVON
HE RAISED THEM AND LOOKED OUT TOO
AND WITH THEM WYLDER HIS THOUGHTS
BUT THE FACT IS IF I THOUGHT YOU WOULD MENTION THE MATTER I COULD NOT TOUCH IT EVEN FOR YOU
I PRESUME MISS LAKE I MAY TAKE A CHAIR CERTAINLY SIR IF YOU INSIST ON MY LISTENING TO-NIGHT WHICH I SHOULD CERTAINLY DECLINE IF I HAD THE POWER THANK YOU MISS LAKE AND THE ATTORNEY TOOK A CHAIR CROSSING ONE LEG OVER THE OTHER AND THROWING HIS HEAD BACK AS HE RECLINED IN IT WITH HIS LONG ARM OVER THE BACK--THE EXPRESS IMAGE AS HE FANCIED OF A POLISHED GENTLEMAN CONDUCTING A DIPLOMATIC INTERVIEW WITH A CLEVER AND HIGH-BRED LADY
WHY SHOULD IT BE NECESSARY TO BUY OFF THE CONSPIRATORS WHOM A GUILTLESS MAN WOULD DEFY AND PUNISH
HE WAS--I WAS SURE OF THAT--CONNECTED WITH THE BRANDON FAMILY
STANLEY TURNED HIS PALE GLARE OF FURY FROM RACHEL TO DORCAS AND DORCAS SAID AGAIN WHAT IS IT RACHEL DARLING RACHEL WITH A BRIGHT BLUSH ON HER CHEEKS STEPPED QUICKLY UP TO HER PUT HER ARMS ABOUT HER NECK AND KISSED HER AND OVER HER SHOULDER SHE CRIED TO HER BROTHER TELL HER STANLEY AND SO SHE QUICKLY LEFT THE ROOM AND WAS GONE
CHAPTER LXVI
IF YOU REFLECT YOU MUST SEE IT
WAS HE THERE?--NO
FINDING THAT THE BODY WAS THAT OF MARCUS WYLDER ESQUIRE OF RADDISTON AND THAT HE HAD COME BY HIS DEATH IN CONSEQUENCE OF TWO WOUNDS INFLICTED WITH A SHARP INSTRUMENT IN THE REGION OF THE HEART BY SOME PERSON OR PERSONS UNKNOWN AT A PERIOD OF FOUR WEEKS SINCE OR UPWARDS CHELFORD WAS ENGAGED IN THE SICK ROOM AS I UNDERSTOOD IN CONFERENCE WITH THE PATIENT
THAT ODD LOOK I DETECTED IN THE MIRROR--WHAT DID IT MEAN
HIS ESTATES IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND INDEED
GOOD-BYE SAID RACHEL
WHEN THEREFORE MR LARKIN HEARD FROM THE PORTLY AND VERACIOUS MR LARCOM WHO WAS ON VERY HAPPY RELATIONS WITH THE PROPRIETOR OF THE LODGE THAT TOM WEALDON HAD BEEN TWICE QUIETLY TO BRANDON TO LUNCH AND HAD TALKED AN HOUR ALONE WITH THE CAPTAIN IN THE LIBRARY EACH TIME
AND OLD TAMAR STOOD UP AND SHADED HER EYES WITH HER SHRUNKEN HAND
SHE PASSED IT AND THE MILLS AND NEVER STOPPED TILL SHE REACHED THE VICARAGE
UPON MY WORD YOUNG LADY
WELL RADIE DEAR--YOU HAVE PUT YOUR HAND TO THE PLOUGH AND YOU SHA'N'T TURN BACK NOW WHAT NO--YOU SHA'N'T TURN BACK NOW YOU SEEM SIR TO FANCY THAT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO CHOOSE FOR MYSELF SAID MISS RACHEL SPIRITEDLY
IN THE MEAN TIME MR LARKIN HAD GOT AMONG THE NOBLE TREES OF BRANDON AND WAS APPROACHING THE LORDLY FRONT OF THE HALL
I AM SPEAKING FRANKLY WHEN I SAY THERE MUST BE A TOTAL CHANGE
BUT CHELFORD WANTED TO SEE HIM ABOUT MR WYLDER
LARKIN DID NOT LIKE IT
AND THEN BETHOUGHT HIM OF SOMETHING TO BE TRIED
HE SELDOM EXPRESSED AN ILL ONE OF ANYBODY AND THEN IT WAS IN VERY MEASURED LANGUAGE
BUT SHORTLY AFTER AS I SUPPOSE SLEEP OVERTOOK ME AND I HAVE NO DISTINCT IDEA FOR HOW LONG MY SLUMBER LASTED
HE'S SECRET
AND THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN THIN AND TALL IN WHITE NECKTIE AND BLACK A LITTLE THREADBARE STOOD ON THE STEPS OF THE PORCH IN A SAD ABSTRACTION
PEOPLE SAY HE HAS NOT ENOUGH LEFT TO GO ON WITH
NOR YOU DON'T WHO'VE BEEN FOR TEN YEARS OVER THOSE D--D PAPERS
IT WAS NOT FROM MALICE
IS THERE IMMEDIATE DANGER THE DOCTOR SAYS NOT BUT HE IS VERY MUCH ALARMED FOR TO-MORROW OH
YOU MUST ARRANGE ABOUT CHELFORD AND LAKE
IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT MISGIVING ABOUT A GENTLEMAN OF LARKIN'S SPECIES THE FAMILY LAWYER WHO BECOME VISCERA MAGNORUM DOMUUM
GOOD-NIGHT HE SHOOK HER HAND AND JERKED IT FROM HIM WITH SUPPRESSED FURY PASSING ON WITH A QUICKENED PACE
DORCAS SAT STATELY AND SAD--LOOKING FROM THE WINDOW TOWARD THE DISTANT SUNSET HORIZON PILED IN DUSKY GOLD AND CRIMSON CLOUDS AGAINST THE FADED GREEN SKY--A GLORY THAT IS ALWAYS MELANCHOLY AND DREAMY
AND NATURE WHO HAD GATHERED IN THE PAST WAS PROVIDING FOR THE FUTURE
SO WITHOUT TROUBLING HER WITH QUESTIONS SHE MADE TEA AND THEN SOME NEGUS WITH CAREFUL AND TREMBLING HANDS
AND LIKED TO CALL ALOUD TO THE PORTERS TUMBLING AMONG THE LUGGAGE--'JOS
I AM SURE HE OFTEN WORE IT WHEN HE WAS QUITE ALONE
AND WHEN YOU HAVE HEARD ALL--WHICH UPON MY SOUL AND HONOUR YOU SHALL THE MOMENT I AM ENABLED TO PROVE ALL--YOU WILL THANK ME FOR HAVING BRAVED YOUR MOMENTARY DISPLEASURE TO SPARE YOU A GREAT DEAL OF USELESS AND MISERABLE SUSPENSE
THAT NIGHT HE POSTED A NOTE TO BURLINGTON SMITH AND CO AND BY SATURDAY NIGHT'S POST THERE CAME DOWN TO THE SHERIFF AN EXECUTION FOR 123_L AND SOME ODD SHILLINGS UPON A JUDGMENT ON A WARRANT TO CONFESS AT THE SUIT OF THAT FIRM FOR COSTS AND MONEY ADVANCED AGAINST THE POOR VICAR WHO NEVER DREAMED AS HE CONNED OVER HIS NEXT DAY'S SERMON WITH HIS SOLITARY CANDLE THAT THE BLOW HAD VIRTUALLY DESCENDED AND THAT HIS HOMELY FURNITURE THE SILVER SPOONS HIS WIFE HAD BROUGHT HIM AND THE TWO SHELVES HALF FULL OF OLD BOOKS WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT HER AND ALL THE REST OF THEIR LITTLE FRUGAL TRUMPERY TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN THIN PERSON HAD PASSED INTO THE HANDS OF MESSRS
HE WAS THINKING OF THE LEAVE-TAKING--OF POOR DOLLY AND LITTLE FAIRY
THERE IT WAS
BUT HE COULD NOT OBSERVE THE SLIGHTEST INDICATION OF CHANGE
THERE IS A DREADFUL IMAGE--AND I SOMETIMES THINK A DREADFUL BEING ALWAYS NEAR ME
WHAT WAS THE PECULIARITY IN THAT SLIGHT MOVEMENT--SOMETHING IN THE KNEE
WHO KNEW TO WHAT IT MIGHT CONDUCT
THE SINS OF HIS YOUTH AND HE SIGHED
I SEE--TO BE SURE--REALLY WYLDER IT DOES YOUR TASTE INFINITE CREDIT I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WYLDER CHUCKLING BENIGNANTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
WHEN HE WENT INTO THE NURSERY LITTLE FAIRY WAS SITTING UP TAKING HIS MEDICINE
YOU'VE SEEN LITTLE FAIRY ASKED THE GOOD VICAR WITH A VERY ANXIOUS SMILE AND YOU THINK HIM BETTER DEAR MISS LAKE DON'T YOU WHY I CAN'T SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SO SOON AS HE'S BETTER HE'LL BE QUITE WELL
AND WHITE OLD TAMAR WHO HAD NOT SPOKEN SO MUCH FOR A MONTH BEFORE PUT ON HER SOLEMN ROUND SPECTACLES AND BY HER DIPT CANDLE READ HER CHAPTER IN THE PONDEROUS BIBLE SHE HAD THUMBED SO WELL AND HER WHITE LIPS TOLD OVER THE WORDS AS SHE READ THEM IN SILENCE
CHAPTER VII
SO DARLING YOU HAVE IT ALL
UNSEEN I SAW RACHEL AND DORCAS BEAUTIFUL IN THE SAD MOONLIGHT PASSED SO NEAR WE COULD HAVE SPOKEN--PASSED ME LIKE SPIRITS--NEVER MORE IT MAY BE TO CROSS MY SIGHT IN LIFE
RACHEL DARLING YOU MUST NOT SAY THAT--I LOVE YOU SO--SO DESPERATELY YOU DON'T KNOW I CAN SAY NOTHING ELSE LORD CHELFORD
LARKIN HAD ALSO THE VICAR'S BUSINESS AND REVERSION TO ATTEND TO
I HAD NOW GOT HALF-WAY IN MY SECOND CHEROOT AND THE CLOCK CLANGED ONE IT WAS A VERY STILL NIGHT AND THE PROLONGED BOOM VIBRATED STRANGELY IN MY EXCITED EARS AND BRAIN
LARKIN TO THE SELECTION
I THINK I COULD
OF THE SECOND PART AND SO FORTH
HE IS HARDLY EVER WITHOUT A BLACK EYE
STILL IT HAD THAT UNPLEASANT CHARACTER REMAINING FIXED ON ITS FEATURES
THEREFORE I DON'T THINK HE WAS QUITE SO CAREFUL AS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO SPARE LAKE THAT JOLT UPON THE ELBOW WHICH COMING FROM A RIVAL IN A MOMENT OF PUBLIC TRIUMPH WAS NOT ALTOGETHER EASY TO BEAR LIKE A CHRISTIAN
IT WAS DATED FROM GENEVA AND SAID DEAR LARKIN,--I SAW MY FRIEND SMITH HERE IN THE CAFE WHO HAS KEPT A BRIGHT LOOK OUT I DARE SAY
AND I'D MUCH RATHER CAPTAIN LAKE MOVE IN THIS MATTER--SINCE MOVE I MUST--IN YOUR INTEREST--I MEAN AS YOUR FRIEND AND MAN OF BUSINESS--THAN IN ANY WAY CAPTAIN LAKE THAT MIGHT POSSIBLY INVOLVE YOU IN TROUBLE YOU ARE MY MAN OF BUSINESS--AREN'T YOU
BUT THE RAT'S EYES WERE LOOKING AT HER WITH A HUNGRY SUSPICION AND SMILED NOT
WHEN THE OPERATION WAS COMPLETED THERE REMAINED NO DOUBT WHATEVER ON MY MIND
I DID ADVISE WHEN IT WAS YET TIME TO PROFIT BY ADVICE
YOU USED TO BE ACCURATE TAMAR
AND I WON'T MORTGAGE SAID STANLEY
FOR I ASSURE YOU RADIE AND I WOULD NOT ASK IT IF IT COULD BE AVOIDED
I CAN'T SAY I VERY MUCH ADMIRE LADY CONSTANCE THOUGH SHE IS TO BE CHELFORD'S WIFE
SECRET_--YES--BUT NO SECRET IN THE EVIL SENSE--A SECRET ONLY AWAITING THE EVIDENCE WHICH I DAILY EXPECT AND THEN TO BE STATED FULLY AND FRANKLY TO YOU MY ONLY DARLING AND AS COMPLETELY BLOWN TO THE WINDS DORCAS LOOKED IN HIS STRANGE FACE WITH HER PROUD SAD GAZE LIKE ONE GUESSING AT A FUNEREAL ALLEGORY
AND VERY SOLEMN TOO THE LOOK-OUT FROM THE WINDOW AMONG THE COLONNADES OF TALL OLD TREES ON THE OVERSHADOWED EARTH AND THROUGH THEM INTO DEEPEST DARKNESS
HE HAS ONLY TO HAND YOU A RECEIPT IN MY NAME FOR THE AMOUNT OF CHEQUES YOU MAY GIVE HIM AND TO LODGE A PORTION OF IT WHERE I TOLD HIM AND THE REST TO BUY CONSOLS
MOST WOMEN I AM SURE WOULD ABHOR ME--YES DORCAS--_ABHOR ME YOU AND I AGAINST THE WORLD RADIE SAID DORCAS WITH A WILD SMILE AND A DARK ADMIRATION IN HER LOOK AND KISSING RACHEL AGAIN
I WISH I WAS HANDSOME MY LITTLE MAN AND CLEVER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SIR I REPEAT
I HAVE ONCE OR TWICE FOUND MYSELF ON A SUDDEN IN TOTAL SILENCE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SOMEWHAT PROLIX THOUGH HUMOROUS STORY COMMENCED IN AN UPROAR FOR THE SOLE RECREATION OF MY PRETTY NEIGHBOUR AND ENDED--PATCHED UP RENOUNCED_--A FALTERING FAILURE UNDER THE CONVERGING GAZE OF A STERNLY ATTENTIVE AUDIENCE
LARKIN ESQ
I HAVE OFTEN SINCE THOUGHT UPON THE ODD SENSATION WITH WHICH I HESITATED OVER HIS UNOPENED LETTER
BUT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS BY NO MEANS A SAFE THING TO CROSS HIS PATH
SHE QUIVERED WITH TERROR LEST HE SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER AND MIGHT BE MEDITATING SOME MISCHIEF
THEN THE ATTORNEY NOW IN HIS TURN FLUSHED AND VERY MUCH ELATED CONGRATULATED THE POOR VICAR ON HIS EMANCIPATION FROM HIS DIFFICULTIES
YOUR OUTCAST AND MISERABLE SISTER ON STANLEY'S LIPS HIS SERENE UNPLEASANT SMILE WAS GLEAMING AS HE CLOSED THE NOTE CARELESSLY
I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT WHEN THAT GOOD MAN MR LARKIN LEFT HIS PRESENCE CAPTAIN LAKE INDULGED IN A PERFECTLY BLASPHEMOUS MONOLOGUE
BEAUTY SOMETIMES SEEN AGAIN DOES EXCEL OUR RECOLLECTIONS OF IT
IT IS NOT THAT BUT ONLY THAT YOU MUST NEVER NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN OH
AND ALTHOUGH WITH HER FRIEND RACHEL LAKE SHE LIVES ABROAD CHIEFLY IN ITALY AND SWITZERLAND BRANDON HALL BY THE COMMAND OF ITS PROPRIETOR LIES ALWAYS AT HER DISPOSAL
THE AMBITIOUS CAPTAIN WALKED OUT SNIFFING WHITE AND INCENSED
LARKIN DID NOT REPEAT HIS CHALLENGE
YOU HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN ME
IT IS SO GREAT A RELIEF TO HAVE COMPANIONSHIP
I DARE SAY
FOR I SAW MR MARK WYLDER LATE LAST NIGHT AT SHILLINGSWORTH LEAVING MAJOR JACKSON IN CONSIDERABLE SURPRISE MR LARKIN WALKED OFF TO EDWARDS DWELLING AT THE TOP OF CHURCH STREET AND FOUND THAT ACTIVE POLICEMAN AT HOME
I CONTINUED TO STARE UPON THIS APPARITION WITH THE MOST DREADFUL FASCINATION I EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE
YOU MUST NOT GO UNTIL YOU HAVE EATEN SOMETHING TIME ENOUGH DARLING
IT MUST CONCERN ME SIR AND I INSIST ON HEARING IT ALL SO YOU SHALL RADIE
IT WOULDN'T PAY I DID NOT HALF LIKE THE EQUIVOCAL OFFICE WHICH MY FRIEND MARK HAD PREPARED FOR ME
AND LIKING HIS MONEY THOUGHT HE LIKED HIMSELF--A CONFUSION NOT UNCOMMON
A STYLE I ADMIRE RATHER THOUGH IT IS NOT VERY REFINED NOR AT ALL CLASSIC
MY DUTIES WERE LIGHTER AS ADVISER THAN I AT FIRST APPREHENDED
THERE WAS A PECULIARITY IN HER GREETING WHICH I FELT A LITTLE OVERAWING WITHOUT EXACTLY DISCOVERING IN WHAT IT CONSISTED
BUT SHE COULD NOT GET INTO THE SPIRIT OF HER LETTER
BUT IT WON'T BE LONG TILL I RUN UP MY FLAG AGAIN AND TAKE THE COMMAND
AND THIS IS THE MEANING OF THE CURSE THAT HAS ALWAYS FOLLOWED US
SO WILLIAM HAS MARRIED ON L180 A YEAR AND THE CAPTAIN LAUGHED QUIETLY BUT VERY PLEASANTLY AGAIN
OH WILLIE DARLING YOU LOOK SO HAPPY--YOU WERE UNEASY THIS EVENING SAID HIS LITTLE UGLY WIFE WITH A BEAUTIFUL SMILE JUMPING UP AND CLASPING HIM
I DID NOT THINK THAT HUMAN WICKEDNESS COULD PRODUCE SUCH A BROTHER AS YOU ARE WELL IT IS NO NEWS WHAT YOU THINK OF ME AND NOT MUCH MATTER EITHER
SIR YOU COMMITTED FOR ONCE THE RARE INDISCRETION OF TELLING THE TRUTH
IS THAT FAIRY
AND THE HORSEHAIR HAS SUFFICED FOR AN HOUR AND WHY NOT FOR ANOTHER--AND SOON
A STATEMENT OF TITLE IS USUALLY A DRY AFFAIR
THERE IS NOT A MAN WITH A CHANCE OF ACCEPTANCE TO COME FORWARD IF I REFUSE
THE PRETTY MILL-ROAD RUNNING UP THROUGH REDMAN'S DELL DANK AND DARK WITH TALL ROMANTIC TREES WAS LEFT BEHIND IN ANOTHER MOMENT
TAMAR YES MISS RACHEL WHY DO YOU COME SO SOFTLY TAMAR
PERHAPS HE AND LAKE MIGHT GO IN TOGETHER THOUGH HE'D RATHER BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE HON
AND IN ANOTHER MINUTE THE CAPTAIN WITH A LIGHTED CIGAR BETWEEN HIS LIPS MOUNTED TO THE SEAT TOOK THE REINS THE HORSE BOUNDED OFF AND AWAY RATTLED THE LIGHT CONVEYANCE SPARKS FLYING FROM THE ROAD AT A DEVIL OF A PACE DOWN THE DESERTED STREET OF GYLINGDEN AND QUICKLY MELTED IN DARKNESS
THERE ARE NO DOUBT--PARDON ME--SEVERAL LITTLE MATTERS TO BE ARRANGED
AND PERHAPS IT WILL BE BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD LOOK IN AT THE LODGE WHEN HE MENTIONED THE LODGE IT WAS IN SO LOFTY A WAY THAT A STRANGER WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT SOMETHING VERY HANDSOME INDEED AND ONE OF THE SIGHTS OF THE COUNTY
MEANER HOUSES HAVE GROWN UP INTO DUKEDOMS
BUT UNDER MY UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MOST URGENT IMPORTANCE--A LOAN OF THREE HUNDRED POUNDS--DID HE MENTION IT AGAIN MR LARKIN SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH THE SAME SAD SMILE
HIS OLD FRIEND SIR FRANCIS SEDDLEY SUMMONED BY THE TELEGRAPH WAS NOW GLIDING FROM LONDON ALONG THE RAILS FOR DOLLINGTON STATION
BUT I AM THINKING OF DOING SOMETHING FOR YOU
THE CHANGE WAS SO LITTLE THAT I DO NOT THINK ANY BUT SHE AND RACHEL SAW IT
AND I THINK THEY FANCY HE IS A VERY CRAFTY MAN
BUT THERE WERE LARCOM'S CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE MAD-HOUSE TO THROW INTO THE BALANCE
YES YOU ARE ILL AND HE HASTILY THREW OPEN THE WINDOW CLOSE TO WHICH THEY WERE SITTING AND SHE QUICKLY REVIVED IN THE COOLING AIR
PERHAPS YOU HAVE
YOU CAN'T THINK HOW I HATE THIS--HOUSE
SHE CERTAINLY DOES TALK SUCH NONSENSE
AND SO WEALDON GOT INSTRUCTIONS IN HIS OWN PHRASE TO GO THE WHOLE ANIMAL
I SHOULD I KNOW A GHOST INDEED THE GHOST OF OLD TIMES AN UGLY GHOST ENOUGH FOR MANY OF US
AND IT WAS NOT EVERY HOUSE WHICH COULD SATISFY LONDON SWELLS OF CAPTAIN LAKE'S FASHION AND HABITS HE COULD TELL HIM
AND IF THINGS GO TO THE WORST I TELL YOU I'LL NOT STAY
THERE IS ANOTHER VERY FINE ONE OVER THE BRANDON PEW--A FREAK PERHAPS OF SOME OF THOSE OLD BRANDONS OR WYLDERS WHO HAD A STRANGE SPIRIT OF CYNICISM MINGLING IN THEIR PROFLIGACY AND VIOLENCE
THAT SPIRIT BELONGS TO THE BLOOD OF OUR STRANGE RACE
BUT IT IS ALWAYS SO WHEN HE IS EVER SO LITTLE ILL MY PRECIOUS LITTLE MAN
AND I REALLY THINK ONCE OR TWICE HE WAS GOING TO TELL ME OH
SHE IS GOOD-LOOKING--A LITTLE COARSE SOME PEOPLE THINK RESUMED THE YOUNG MAN
RACHEL'S AGONY BROKE FORTH IN A LOUD WILD CRY
YET I THINK I WAS NATURALLY BOLD AND TRUE
YOU'VE INTERESTED YOURSELF A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MARK WYLDER'S MOVEMENTS NOT MORE THAN MY DUTY CLEARLY IMPOSED YES
THE POINT WAS CARRIED ON TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS BUT THE DECISION OF THE COURT BELOW WAS ULTIMATELY AFFIRMED
BUT YOU TELL ME NOTHING STANLEY NOT DARLING TILL I KNOW IT MYSELF
I AM VERY PROUD OF IT
THEIR SPIRIT I AM SURE IS IN US RACHEL
FOR SPARKS THE MILLIONAIRE CLOTHIER WHO HAD PURCHASED BEVERLEY AND WAS A POTENT VOICE IN THE DOLLINGTON BANK AND WHOSE POLITICS WERE DOUBTFUL AND RELATIONS AMPHIBIOUS WAS SITTING IN THE PEW NEARLY OPPOSITE AND SHOWED HIS RED FAT FACE AND WHITE WHISKERS OVER THE OAK WAINSCOTING
AND IT WAS SUCH A BLESSING THERE CERTAINLY WAS NEITHER SCARLATINA NOR SMALL-POX BOTH WHICH ENEMIES HAD APPEARED ON THE NORTHERN FRONTIER OF GYLINGDEN AND WERE PICKING DOWN THEIR TWO OR THREE CASES EACH IN THAT QUARTER
HE WAS CERTAINLY OBSERVING HIM FROM AMONG THE TOMBS IN HIS SLY WAY
KNEW THAT HE LIKED A BIT OF FIRE AT HIS TEA ANY LETTERS--ANY CALLS--ANY NEWS STIRRING NO LETTERS NOR CALLS SIR PLEASE EXCEPT THE BUTCHER'S BOOK
AND ALTHOUGH MY QUARTERS HAD BEEN CHANGED TO THE LOWER STOREY I GREW UNCOMFORTABLE AS IT WAXED LATE AND HALF REGRETTED THAT I HAD NOT MIGRATED TO THE BRANDON ARMS UNCLE LORNE HOWEVER MADE ME NO VISIT THAT NIGHT
BUT DURING AN ABSENCE MARK WYLDER'S SUIT GREW UP AND PROSPERED AND SIR HARRY BRACTON ACQUIESCED
I DON'T THINK RACHEL DEAR YOU HEARD ME SAID DORCAS
IT IS QUITE TRUE
IT IS QUITE TRUE
THE EIGHTH--IS NOT IT?--YES THE EIGHTH ANSWERED RACHEL
RACHEL HAD COME ONE MORNING TO SEE DORCAS AND AWAITING HER APPEARANCE SAT DOWN IN THIS ROOM
WE MUST TAKE ADVICE
AND SHE LOOKED FIXEDLY ON THE PALE FEATURES PRESENTED TO HER AND SAID RACHEL LAKE RACHEL LAKE
I DON'T EVEN GET A LETTER FROM HIM
HE COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH BUT ONE OF THE FELLOWS WITH HIM INTERPRETED AND THEY WERE ALL ANXIOUS TO GET ASHORE
IN FACT HE THOUGHT HIM CAPABLE OF EVERYTHING
ONE O'CLOCK WAS BETTER HOWEVER THAN TWELVE
THERE HAD BEEN MANY LAWSUITS FREQUENT DISINHERITINGS AND EVEN WORSE DOINGS
IT WAS RATHER TRYING IN THIS STATE OF THINGS TO RECEIVE FROM THE TRIUMPHANT BARONET WITH ONLY A PARENTHETICAL DEAR LAKE I BEG YOUR PARDON A ROUGH KNOCK ON THE ELBOW OF THE HAND THAT HELD HIS GLASS AND TO BE THEN SUMMARILY HUSTLED OUT OF HIS PLACE
GOOD-NATURED BUDDLE HAD BEEN THERE AT NINE QUITE AMAZED AT HIS BEING SO WELL STILL RESERVED AND CAUTIOUS AND AFRAID OF RAISING HOPES
A LOAD WHICH NO MAN COULD LIFT LAY UPON HER HEART
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD EVER LIKE ME BUT RACHEL'S HAND ON A SUDDEN WITH A SLIGHT QUIVER WAS DRAWN FROM HIS
HIS SHOULDERS WERE NESTLED INTO THE CORNER AND HIS FACE BURIED AMONG HIS LOOSE MUFFLERS
THE BILLIARD-MARKER AT HIS CLUB KNOWS HIS HAUNTS
THERE WAS ONLY A CHINK OF THE SHUTTER OPEN
HERE COMES THE FAIR BRUNNISENDE AND HE MADE HIS SALUTATION
AND THE STORY MIGHT GET ABROAD BEFORE THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE VICAR'S INTEREST
LAUGHINGLY HALF-RESISTING THE YOUNG MAN WAITED TILL HER ENTHUSIASTIC SALUTATION WAS OVER AND WITH ONE GLOVED HAND CARESSINGLY ON HER SHOULDER AND WITH THE OTHER SMOOTHING HIS RUFFLED MOUSTACHE HE LAUGHED A LITTLE MORE A QUIET LOW LAUGH
WHEN LAWYER LARKIN REACHED THE DIM CHAMBER WITH THE DUTCH TAPESTRIES WHERE HE HAD FOR A LITTLE WHILE TO AWAIT CAPTAIN LAKE'S LEISURE HE BEGAN TO ANTICIPATE THE SCENE NOW SO IMMEDIATELY IMPENDING MORE UNCOMFORTABLY THAN BEFORE
HOW DO YOU DO OLD RUDDLE--QUITE WELL ASKED THE CAPTAIN WITH A SMILE
I DON'T ASPIRE TO THE POSITION--I AM WILLING AT THIS MOMENT TO RETIRE FROM IT
LARKIN ESQ THE LODGE GYLINGDEN RECEIVED FROM LONDON A PRINTED FORM DULY FILLED IN AND WITH THE OFFICIAL SIGNATURE ATTACHED INFORMING HIM THAT ENQUIRY HAVING BEEN INSTITUTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS LETTER NO RESULT HAD BEEN OBTAINED
BUT TO BUY MY PERSONAL LIBERTY AND THE RIGHT TO VISIT MY BROTHER AT GAMWELL--NEVER AND YET SHE LOOKED LORD CHELFORD THOUGHT VERY GOODHUMOURED AND PLEASANT AND HE FANCIED A SMILE FROM HER MIGHT DO MORE WITH SOME MEN THAN ALL GENTLE JOAN'S HONEYED VOCABULARY
AND SHE'S TOO SOLEMN BY HALF AND GRAND
HOW IS HE DORCAS VERY ILL DEAR I'M AFRAID--SIT DOWN DARLING RACHEL WAS RELIEVED FOR IN HER PANIC SHE ALMOST FEARED TO ASK IF HE WERE LIVING
MY POOR LITTLE FAIRY--MY POOR DOLLY--MY POOR GOOD FRIEND WILLIAM
AH YES--I THINK--SHOULD MY ENGAGEMENTS PERMIT--OF STARTING EARLY TO-MORROW
THIS SEA-MONSTER SMOKED HERE AS UNCEREMONIOUSLY AS HE WOULD HAVE DONE IN REES'S DIVAN AND I ONLY WONDER HE DID NOT CALL FOR BRANDY-AND-WATER
CHAPTER LXIII
NEITHER DOES THE WORLD KNOW OR SUSPECT ANYTHING OF THE MATTER
WHAT MIGHT NOT ARISE FROM SUCH A SITUATION BETWEEN STANLEY AND MARK WYLDER EACH IN HIS WAY A WORTHY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ILL-CONDITIONED AND TERRIBLE RACE WHOSE BLOOD HE INHERITED
DID EITHER MISS LAKE OR THE CAPTAIN USE THE WORD MAD-HOUSE WELL NO OR ANY OTHER WORD--LUNATIC ASYLUM OR A--BEDLAM OR--OR ANY OTHER WORD MEANING THE SAME THING WELL I CAN'T SAY SIR AS I REMEMBER
SHE IS VERY CHARMING AND CLEVER OF COURSE SO LONG AS SHE SPEAKS OF THE KIND OF THING SHE UNDERSTANDS
ON THE CONTRARY IT RATHER PLACES ME IN AN AWKWARD POSITION KEEPING OTHER PEOPLE'S SECRETS THE ATTORNEY MADE ONE OF HIS SLIGHT GENTLEMANLIKE BOWS AND THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH A LOFTY AND RESERVED LOOK
NOW THE PLAIN QUESTION IS DO YOU WISH TO RETAIN MY SERVICES CERTAINLY SAID CAPTAIN LAKE BITING HIS LIP WITH A SINISTER LITTLE FROWN
HE HAD BEEN PERHAPS A LITTLE FOOLISH AND FANCIFUL IN THE ARTICLE OF BOOKS AND HAD COMMITTED A SERIOUS INDISCRETION IN THE MATTER OF A CARVED OAK BOOKCASE
QUITE SO WHISPERED LAKE
THE ATTORNEY MADE A HUNGRY SNATCH AT THE PAPER OVER WILLIAM WYLDER'S SHOULDER NEARLY BEARING THAT GENTLEMAN DOWN ON HIS FACE BUT HIS CLUTCH FELL SHORT
HYPOCRITES ARE CONTRARY TO MOSES
WHAT YOU PLEASE--WISE OR FOOLISH--YOU'LL DO IN WHAT CONCERNS YOURSELF;--YOU ALWAYS HAVE_--WITHOUT CONSULTING ME
I COULD TELL YOU HOW IT REALLY STANDS NOW ONLY I HAVE NOT TIME
AND THESE PEARLS
THE LATTER I WAS PRETTY CONFIDENT ABOUT
YOU WILL SEE DORCAS DARLING YOU ARE CERTAINLY ILL
AND WHERE CAPTAIN LAKE DID IT OCCUR MAY I ENQUIRE SAID LARKIN WITH HIS CHARMING INSINUATION
ARE YOU BETTER DEAR WHISPERED RACHEL
THE DOCTOR PEEPED OUT OF HIS PARLOUR
THERE WAS BUT ONE FIGURE IN IT--SLENDER LIGHT-HAIRED WITH HIS YELLOW MOUSTACHE AND PALE FACE GROWN OF LATE A LITTLE FATTER
WHERE SHALL IT BE THEY WERE IN THE GREAT DRAWING-ROOM WHERE I HAD FIRST SEEN DORCAS BRANDON AND RACHEL LAKE ON THE EVENING ON WHICH MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PRINCELY HALL WAS RENEWED AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SO MANY YEARS
BE HE NEAR OR BE HE FAR I REGARD HIS VERY NAME WITH HORROR DORCAS RETURNED HER GAZE WITH ONE OF HAUGHTY AMAZEMENT
WELL HE INTENDED LOCKING HIM QUIETLY INTO THE SUITE OF THREE APARTMENTS YOU KNOW AT THE FAR END OF THE OLD GALLERY AND GIVING HIM FULL COMMAND OF THE MULBERRY GARDEN BY THE LITTLE PRIVATE STAIR AND PUTTING A GOOD IRON DOOR TO IT
I WISH I COULD ENJOY THEM LIKE YOU
OF COURSE IT IS ALL RIGHT
THE SONG CEASED
WHEN HE WAS QUITE ASSURED THAT ALL WAS QUIET HE SHUT AND BOLTED HIS DOOR CLOSED THE WINDOW-SHUTTERS AND RELIGHTED HIS PAIR OF WAX CANDLES
I'M VERY GLAD YOU SAY SO
THE ATTORNEY ONLY TOUCHED ON THIS REMARKING IN A FRIENDLY WAY BUT THEN YOU KNOW IT IS SO MERE A SHADOW THIS INDEED POOR WILLIAM KNEW VERY WELL
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR PRIDE HAS BEEN HURT
IN BRANDON PARK
HE HATED THE FRESH GLITTER OF THAT MORNING SCENE
THEN HE ENQUIRED AFTER THE TWO HEIFERS THAT MR JOHNSON WAS SO GOOD AS TO FEED FOR HIM ON HIS LITTLE FARM
AND LET ME SEE IT ON YOU WHEN NEXT I COME AND WITH A COURTESY AND A GREAT BEAMING SMILE ON HER HOT FACE SHE ACCEPTED THE FIVE-POUND NOTE WHICH HE PLACED IN HER HAND
YOU ACCOMPANIED MR MARK WYLDER IN HIS MIDNIGHT FLIGHT TO LONDON MISS LAKE
WON'T YOU TAKE SOMETHING BUT JOS
I MAY AS WELL MENTION HERE THAT THE ATTORNEY DID PRESENT THE NOTE TO SIR J
SHE LEANED HER TEMPLE ON HER HAND AND HER RICH LIGHT HAIR HALF COVERED HER FINGERS AND HER AMAZING INTERVIEW WITH DORCAS WAS AGAIN PRESENT WITH HER AND THE SAME FEELING OF BEWILDERMENT
REMEMBER STANLEY HOW LONG THE ESTATE HAS BEEN PRESERVED
WILL YOU COME RACHEL AT SIGHT OF THIS CASTLE OR COTTAGE IN THE AIR RACHEL LIGHTED UP
IN THIS STAGE OF HIS REVERIE HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A TALL POWDERED FOOTMAN IN THE BRANDON LIVERY WHO CAME RESPECTFULLY TO ANNOUNCE THAT HIS MASTER DESIRED TO SEE MR LARKIN
HE IS AFFEARD
HE COULD NOT DREAM OF HIS DYING
A THREATENING NOTICE
I WAS NOW APPROACHING BRANDON HALL
PERHAPS HE HAD OTHER PLANS TOO
I SAY SAID STANLEY ADDRESSING THE KEEPER WHOM BY A BECK HE HAD BROUGHT TO HIS SIDE YOU DON'T ALLOW HIM SURELY TO GO ALONE NOW NO SIR--SINCE YOUR ORDER SIR SAID THE STERN RESERVED OFFICIAL
HE IS SUCH AN ADMIRABLE SURGEON
AND SO SHE GOT THE GIRL TO LIGHT CANDLES AND ASKED HER A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS AND OBLIGED HER IN FACT TO SPEAK CONSTANTLY THOUGH SHE SEEMED TO LISTEN BUT LITTLE
I AND ANASTASIA WILL REMAIN IN THE CLOAK-ROOM
STUNNED STUPID AND WILD--ALWAYS AGITATED--IT IS NOT EASY TO COMPOSE HIS SERMONS AS FINELY AS HERETOFORE
BUT DEAR IT IS TOO LATE--I HAVE SIGNED THIS--THIS INSTRUMENT--AND IT IS TOO LATE
HE WAS PERHAPS CONTENT TO SEE IT EVEN WHEN HE LOOKED IN THE GLASS AND HAD NOT A VERY DISTINCT IDEA WHAT THE UNDERLYING FEATURES MIGHT BE
HER WILLIE WOULD NOT TELL HER YET
YOU WILL NEVER KNOW PERHAPS HOW MUCH IT IS TO ME THE YOUNG QUEEN LOOKED ON HER KINDLY BUT SADLY THROUGH HER LARGE STRANGE EYES CLOUDED WITH A PRESAGE OF FUTURITY AND SHE KISSED HER AGAIN AND SAID RACHEL DEAR I HAVE A PLAN FOR YOU AND ME
HE HAD SPOKEN TRUTH STRANGELY ENOUGH WHEN HE MENTIONED HIS GAMBLING DEBTS AS AN INCENTIVE TO HIS MARRIAGE WITH THE HEIRESS OF BRANDON IN THAT SUNDAY WALK WITH RACHEL IN THE PARK
TAKE HIM BY THE HAND MERCIFUL LADS OR THEY'LL DRAW HIM DOWN AGAIN AND WITH THESE WORDS UNCLE LORNE RECEDED AND I SAW HIM NO MORE
THE FACE AND FIGURE WERE STANLEY LAKE'S
I HAVE NOW FORMED MINE AND ALL THAT'S OVER
WELL CHILD SAID HE GENTLY I THINK I KNOW YOUR FACE BUT I FORGET YOUR NAME LITTLE MARGERY PLEASE SIR FROM MISS LAKE AT REDMAN'S FARM SHE REPLIED WITH A COURTESY
THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF MARK WYLDER BEYOND THE CHARGE OF HIS MONEY AND MAKING A SMALL PAYMENT TO AN OLD MRS DUTTON IN LONDON BY HIS DIRECTION AND THAT BEYOND THIS HE WAS AS ABSOLUTELY IN THE DARK AS SHE OR CHELFORD
IT WAS HIS PRIMARY IMPRESSION HERE
AND STUPID AS THE VICAR WAS HE WOULD HARDLY ANNOUNCE THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER TO A CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN IN A FASHION SO OUTRAGEOUS
WHY HAVE NOT YOU A SPARE ENGINE AT A PLACE LIKE THIS
BUT I HATE HIM WHY SHOULD YOU THOUGH
HIS OFFICIAL STATION PRECLUDED PROMINENCE
I ONLY CONJECTURE
THIS TEMPER AN INTENSE RELUCTANCE EVER TO SAY THANK YOU AND A PROFOUND AND QUIET EGOTISM WERE THE INGREDIENTS OF THAT PRIDE ON WHICH--A LITTLE INCONSISTENTLY PERHAPS IN SO EMINENT A CHRISTIAN--HE PIQUED HIMSELF
HAS THERE BEEN ANY REAL CONFIDENCE CAPTAIN LAKE UPON YOUR PART
AND STANLEY LAKE--A GENERAL IN DIFFICULTIES--RETRACED HIS STEPS TOWARD THE PARK GATE THROUGH WHICH HE HAD COME RUMINATING ON HIS SITUATION AND RESOURCES
I'M A QUARTER PAST ELEVEN--WHAT ARE YOU
AND IN SO FAR IT CONFIRMED HIS SUSPICIONS OF LAKE
WHAT DOES MRS
A KIND OF ADORING WHICH I FANCY BELONGS PROPERLY TO THE LORDS OF CREATION AND WHICH WE OF THE WEAKER SEX HAVE NO RIGHT TO PRACTISE MISS LAKE IS PLEASED TO BE IRONICAL TO-NIGHT HE SAID WITH A SMILE
AND CONSIDERABLE CIRCUMSPECTION WILL BE NEEDED PENDING YOUR BROTHER'S ABSENCE IN DEALING WITH THE PERSONS WHO ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESS THEIR CLAIMS UNPLEASANTLY
DEAR ME HOW LONG IT IS SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU SO SHE LED HIM IN BY THE ARM TO HER TINY DRAWING-ROOM
AS I STOOD IN A SORT OF REVERIE LOOKING STRAIGHT UPON THE DOOR I SAW--AND THIS TIME THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE WHATSOEVER--THE HANDLE--THE ONLY MODERN THING ABOUT IT--SLOWLY TURNED AND THE DOOR ITSELF AS SLOWLY PUSHED ABOUT A QUARTER OPEN
CHILDREN HAD ONCE OCCUPIED THAT SILENT FLOOR FOR THERE WAS A LITTLE BALUSTRADED GATE ACROSS THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE
IN THE MEANTIME THERE WAS NOT A MOMENT TO BE LOST IN CLENCHING THE PURCHASE OF FIVE OAKS
WILLIE WAS IN HIS OLD COLLEGE SPIRITS
COME TAMAR TELL ME ONCE FOR ALL--ONLY DROP YOUR VOICE A LITTLE IF YOU PLEASE--WHAT THE PLAGUE HAS GOT INTO YOUR OLD HEAD
RACHEL LAKE BEFORE THE ACCUSER
THEN CAME ANOTHER WHISPER AND A WINK
AYE SIR A SCRIBE AND A PHARISEE A SADDUCEE AND A PUBLICAN AND A PRIEST AND A LEVITE SAID THE FUNCTIONARY WITH A WINK AT LAKE
AND INDEED I THINK I'VE A RIGHT TO ASK THAT ASSISTANCE OF YOU YOU SEEM TO FORGET YOUNG LADY THAT THERE ARE TIMES AND PLACES FOR SUCH DISCUSSIONS
AND THE QUICK GLANCE OF THE ATTORNEY COULD READ NOTHING WHATEVER IN THE CAPTAIN'S PALLID FACE AND DOWNCAST EYES SMILING ON THE POINTS OF HIS VARNISHED BOOTS
CHAPTER XLV
THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND US NOW THE FIFTY POUNDS WHICH GOOD MR LARKIN HAD PROCURED FOR THE IMPROVIDENT VICAR BORE INTEREST I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO SAY AT THIRTY PER CENT
THERE WAS NOTHING IMPRESSED ON THE WAFER BUT A POKE OF SOMETHING LIKE THE FERRULE OF A STICK
I AM TRULY REJOICED MY LORD TO HEAR YOU SAY SO
THEY SHOOK HANDS AGAIN--IT WAS THE THIRD TIME--AND THEN SHE WALKED UP THE LITTLE GRAVEL WALK HARDLY A DOZEN STEPS AND DISAPPEARED WITHIN THE DOOR OF REDMAN'S FARM WITHOUT TURNING ANOTHER PARTING LOOK ON LORD CHELFORD WHO REMAINED AT THE LITTLE PALING--EXPECTING ONE I THINK--TO LIFT HIS HAT AND SAY ONE MORE PARTING WORD
ANYTHING ABOUT RAIKES'S LEASE SAID THE GREAT CAPTAIN LAKE RISING FROM BEHIND HIS DESK WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED SMILE AND EXTENDING HIS GENTLEMANLIKE HAND
LARKIN'S SHINING BALD HEAD NO DOUBT STOOD UP IN SILENT APPEAL
WHEN HE WAS GONE THE VICAR RETURNED FROM THE DOOR-STEP RADIANT--NOT TO THE STUDY BUT TO THE PARLOUR
IT WAS WELL TO HAVE HEARD WITHOUT PROCRASTINATION WHAT HE HAD TO SAY
20TH MARCH
DOLLY OPEN THE WINDOW THERE WAS A SILENCE FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND RACHEL RESUMED NOW WILLIAM WYLDER I AM CONVINCED THAT YOU AND YOUR WIFE AND SHE KISSED DOLLY AND YOUR DEAR LITTLE BOY ARE MARKED OUT FOR PLUNDER--THE OBJECTS OF A CONSPIRACY
AND THE LITTLE ALTERATION WAS MADE AND HENCEFORWARD HE SPOKE OF SIR MULGRAVE AS NOT QUITE A PLEASANT MAN TO DEAL WITH IN MONEY MATTERS
THE ATTORNEY AND CAPTAIN BRANDON LAKE WERE NOW WALKING SIDE BY SIDE OVER THE MORE SEQUESTERED PART OF THE GREEN
IN LETTERS OF FLAME IN THE AIR BEFORE HER
YOU USED NOT TO BE A FOOL TAMAR
CARRYING THEM WITH A SORT OF SWAGGER HE CAME SLOWLY UP TO THE PART OF THE PATHWAY OPPOSITE TO THE PILLAR WHERE HE DROPPED THOSE DRAPERIES IN A HEAP UPON THE GRASS
THEN CAME THE WHISTLE AND THEN THE CLANK AND JERK OF THE START
HOW MUCH HAD HAPPENED
I DON'T CARE TWOPENCE
STILL THERE WAS A SENSE OF WONDER--A GREAT BLANK AND SOMETHING OF PAIN IN THE DISCOVERY--YES PAIN--THOUGH SHE SMILED A FAINT BLUSHING SMILE--ALONE AS SHE WAS
CAN I
AT ANY RATE SOME THINGS DON'T PLEASE US AS WE CALCULATED
BUT IF THEY KNEW THAT THEY WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO A SIFTING EXAMINATION ON OATH ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE COMMISSIONER THEY MIGHT POSSIBLY PREFER FINDING THE LETTER IN WHICH CASE THERE WOULD BE NO MORE ABOUT IT
BUT SHE WAS RIGHT
I SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF HE CAME TO-MORROW
WE LOITERED STANLEY AND I A GREAT DEAL TOO LONG IN THE PARK BUT I AM NOW AT HOME AND I FEAR I HAVE BROUGHT YOU MUCH TOO FAR OUT OF YOUR WAY ALREADY
SEE ALL MY WATERING-POTS AND PRUNING-SCISSORS MY STICKS AND BASS-MAT AND GLASS COVERS
I RATHER THINK HE'S A-DYING
AND LET ME ADD IT STRIKES ME AS HIGHLY IMPORTANT BOTH IN THE INTERESTS OF THE LEADING INDIVIDUALS IN THIS UNPLEASANT BUSINESS AND ALSO AS PERTAINING TO YOUR OWN COMFORT AND SECURITY THAT YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY AVOID COMMUNICATING WHAT YOU HAVE JUST MENTIONED TO ANY OTHER PARTY
AND I BELIEVE HE HAD OFTEN BEEN VIOLENT AND COWARDLY IN HIS ALTERCATIONS WITH HIS SISTER--SO AT LEAST TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WHO WERE VERSED IN THE SCANDALS OF THE FAMILY AFFIRMED
HE WAS ALWAYS FOOLISH AND CHANGEABLE AND A DEAL TOO INNOCENT FOR THEM WICKED OFFICER-GENTLEMEN
THERE--THERE--THERE RADIE--THERE'S A GOOD GIRL
IF THE CAPTAIN HAD HIS EYE ON THE REVERSION IT WOULD REQUIRE NICE NAVIGATION TO CARRY HIS PLAN SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH
YOU WERE VERY NEAR FAINTING NO DEAR--NOTHING--I AM QUITE WELL NOW--GO ON BUT SHE DID NOT GO ON IMMEDIATELY FOR RACHEL WAS TREMBLING IN A KIND OF SHIVERING FIT WHICH DID NOT PASS AWAY TILL AFTER POOR DOLLY WHO HAD NO OTHER STIMULANT AT COMMAND MADE HER DRINK A CUP OF VERY HOT MILK
AND THEIR PICTURES AND TRADITIONS HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED ME
AND THAT OTHER DREAM TO WHICH SHE OFTEN LED ME WITH THE LARGE HAZEL EYES AND CLEAR DELICATE TINTS--SO SWEET SO RIANTE YET SO SAD
I NEED NOT MY DEAR SIR BE MORE PARTICULAR--AT PRESENT AT LEAST
BUT WE HAVE A DOUBLE DEATH
I'LL GIVE UP PLAY
YOU ARE UNJUST
HE SHOWED HIS WORST TO MEN HIS BEST TO GOD
ALTOGETHER HE LOOKED WILD
AND WISH YOU CAPTAIN LAKE NOTHING BUT GOOD SIR--NOTHING BUT GOOD EXCEPT A HASTY WORD OR TWO I KNOW NO REASON YOU SHOULD NOT SAID THE CAPTAIN IN THE SAME TONE
WAS THERE NO MODE OF HEDGING SO THAT WHETHER MARK WYLDER WERE LIVING OR DEAD THE ATTORNEY SHOULD STAND TO WIN
DOES SHE SAY WHERE SHE IS STAYING OR HER SON BOTH I THINK ANSWERED RACHEL LANGUIDLY
SOMETIMES HIS PLAUSIBILITIES HIS VEHEMENCE AND HIS VOWS DISTURBED IT FOR A TIME
HE'S QUITE GENTLE AND SOMETIMES HE'D MAKE YOU DIE O LAUGHING
AS I LOOKED HE SUDDENLY TURNED TOWARD ME AND FIXED UPON ME A COLD AND AS IT SEEMED A WRATHFUL GAZE OVER HIS SHOULDER
IF THE TRUSTEES SMITH THE PORK-BUTCHER OLD CAPTAIN SNOGGLES THE TOWN CLERK AND THE REST HAD TO WAIT SOME TWENTY MINUTES IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AT THE LODGE SO MUCH THE BETTER
RACHEL MET THIS COARSE ATTACK WITH QUIET CONTEMPT
AND HE IS STAYING AT LARKIN'S HOUSE I FIND WYLDER WAS TALKING TO ME ON THE DOOR STEPS AFTER DINNER HAVING IN A RATHER SULKY WAY SWALLOWED MORE THAN HIS USUAL MODICUM OF MADEIRA AND HIS REMARKS WERE DELIVERED INTERRUPTEDLY--TWO OR THREE PUFFS OF HIS CIGAR INTERPOSED BETWEEN EACH SENTENCE
HIS SMILE GREW A LITTLE STRANGER AND HIS FACE A DEGREE WHITER AS HE SET DOWN HIS GLASS QUIETLY GLIDED A LITTLE AWAY AND BRUSHED OFF WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF THE ASPERSION WHICH HIS COAT HAD SUFFERED
NOW THEREFORE LOOKING AT HIS WATCH AND CONSULTING HIS TIME TABLE HE GOT HIS SLIM VALISE FROM UNDER ON TOP OF THE SEAT BEFORE HIM TOGETHER WITH HIS HAT-CASE DESPATCH-BOX STICK AND UMBRELLA AND BRUSHED OFF WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF SOME OF THE GRITTY RAILWAY DUST THAT LAY DRIFTED IN EXTERIOR FOLDS AND HOLLOWS OF HIS COAT REBUTTONED THAT GARMENT WITH PRECISION ARRANGED HIS SHIRT-COLLAR STUFFED HIS MUFFLER INTO HIS COAT-POCKET AND MADE GENERALLY THAT RUDE SACRIFICE TO THE GRACES WITH WHICH NATTY MEN PRECEDE THEIR EXIT FROM THE DUST AND ASHES OF THIS SORT OF SEPULTURE
THE SOUND OF THE OAK DOOR CLOSING HEAVILY BEHIND HIM AND JOHN HUGHES AND THE KEY REVOLVING IN THE LOCK RECALLED HIM AND WITH A SIGH AND A SMILE AND A KINDLY NOD TO JOHN HE LOOKED UP AND ROUND ON THE FAMILIAR AND PRETTY SCENERY UNDECIDED
YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL RADIE
HOW LONG WAS IT SINCE LIPS HAD TOUCHED ITS BRIM BEFORE AND WHOSE
I SEED HIM IN THE TRAIN FROM LUNNON T'OTHER NIGHT
MR LARKIN GOT INTO A LITTLE BROWN ROOM LOOKING INTO THE INN GARDEN AND CALLED FOR SOME LUNCHEON AND PEN AND INK AND HAD OUT A SHEAF OF LAW PAPERS HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM TIED UP IN PROFESSIONAL RED TAPE
SHE WAS ALMOST STARTLED HOWEVER AS SHE APPROACHED THE PORCH TO SEE IT NOD AND A HAND DIMLY WAVED IN TOKEN OF GREETING
WATCHING ALWAYS FOR SIGNS AND OMENS
HE MET TWO LITTLE CHILDREN IN THE STREET AND STOPPED AND SMILED AS HE STOOPED DOWN TO PAT THEM ON THE HEADS AND ASK THEM WHOSE CHILDREN THEY WERE AND GAVE ONE OF THEM A HALFPENNY
PERHAPS IT WAS THIS ODD APPARITION THAT STARTLED LAKE'S HORSE
BUT THERE WAS A PERFECTLY SATISFACTORY IDENTIFICATION OF THE DRESS AND PROPERTIES OF THE CORPSE AS THOSE OF MR MARK WYLDER
SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD ENERGY TO PLAN HER HUSBAND'S CAREER AND MANAGE THAT AFFAIR OF DUNCAN
I DO BELIEVE STANLEY YOU CARE FOR NO ONE BUT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY YOURSELF SHE SAID INSTEAD HOWEVER BUT PERHAPS THE LEAST IN THE WORLD FOR ME AND THAT NOT VERY WISELY SHE CONTINUED A LITTLE FIERCELY FOR FROM THE MOMENT YOU SAW ME YOU'VE DONE LITTLE ELSE THAN TRY TO DISGUST ME MORE THAN I AM WITH MY PENURY AND SOLITUDE
I SHALL PROTECT THE PROPERTY OF MY FAMILY SIR FROM YOUR FOLLY OR YOUR MACHINATIONS
AT ALL EVENTS HE HAD BEEN BEFOREHAND AND TAKEN MEASURES TO QUIET THAT PERSON'S DANGEROUS RESENTMENT
HE HAD NOT A GUINEA
HE WAS RENOVATED AND REFRESHED HIS SOUL WAS STRENGTHENED AND HIS COUNTENANCE WAXED CHEERFUL AND HE BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE HIMSELF AGAIN UNDER THE BROWN CANOPY OF METROPOLITAN SMOKE AND AMONG THE CABS AND GASLIGHTS
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY HOW SHORT THE DAYS HAVE GROWN AS IF IT HAD ALL HAPPENED WITHOUT NOTICE AND CONTRARY TO THE ALMANAC
I CAME FROM DORCAS BRANDON'S BED-CHAMBER DOOR WHERE HER EVIL ANGEL TOLD ME A THING;--AND MARK WYLDER MUST NOT SEEK TO MARRY HER FOR HE WILL BE BURIED ALIVE IF HE DOES AND HE WILL MAYBE NEVER GET UP AGAIN
IT IS ROOMY AND HAIRY AND NO STEPS
AND NO ONE HAS THE HEART TO TEAR THEM FROM THEM
LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY AT THE PROPOSITION AND MARK RETORTED BY TELLING HIM HE WOULD SO INSULT HIM IF HE DECLINED AS TO COMPEL A MEETING
CHAPTER XI
NO MEAT
AN APOLOGY WAS PERHAPS THE BEST AND MOST MODEST SHAPE INTO WHICH HE COULD THROW THE ADVERTISEMENT OF HIS DINNER AT BRANDON--HIS CONFIDENTIAL TALK WITH THE PROUD OLD DOWAGER AND HIS AFTER-DINNER RAMBLE WITH THAT RISING YOUNG PEER LORD CHELFORD
CHAPTER LIV
THE IMAGE OF DORCAS ROSE BEFORE ME
THE PHYSICIAN AFTER A WHILE FINDS THE LEADING FEATURES OF MOST CASES PRETTY MUCH ALIKE
AND I WISH TO SPEAK RATHER LOW FOR REASONS EACH LOOKED THE OTHER IN THE EYES WITH THAT UNCERTAIN AND SINISTER GAZE WHICH HAS A CHARACTER BOTH OF FEAR AND MENACE
IN WHICH DAME DUTTON IS VISITED
FOR THE FIRST TIME WE WERE REALLY A SMALL PARTY
THE TARN IN THE PARK
I'LL SEND DOWN WITH PLEASURE TO ENQUIRE THANK YOU NO
TO HER THERE SEEMED A LIGHT OF INSINCERITY AND CRUELTY IN ITS PALLOR
HER BRANCH INDEED WAS A LITTLE UNDER A CLOUD KEEPING A SMALL PROVISION-SHOP IN THE TOWN OF DWIDDLESTON
THE VICAR AND HIS GOOD LITTLE WIFE WERE AT NAUNTON THAT EVENING TO HEAR A MISSIONARY RECOUNT HIS ADVENTURES AND EXPERIENCES IN JAPAN AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBOURS HAD BEEN CALLED IN TO FILL THE EMPTY CHAIRS
I'LL BRING HIM A NEW BOX
NOW WITH THE VICAR HE WAS IMPERATIVE THAT THE MATTER OF THE REVERSION SHOULD BE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL--ALTOGETHER SACRED IN FACT
AND I DO NOT THINK IT LIKELY YOU'LL SEE ME FOR A GOOD WHILE--POSSIBLY FOR A VERY LONG TIME
BUT HE KNEW THE VIRTUES OF THE DRUG AND CULTIVATED ITS ACQUAINTANCE AND WAS OFTENER UNDER ITS INFLUENCE THAN PERHAPS ANY MORTAL EXCEPT HIMSELF SUSPECTED
HE IS PALPABLY MACHINATING SOMETHING TO MY DESTRUCTION WITH AN INFLUENTIAL ATTORNEY ON WHOM I KEEP A WATCH AND HE HAS GOT SOME FELLOW NAMED DUTTON INTO THE CONSPIRACY
BUT IT IS A CENSORIOUS WORLD AND I CAN ONLY SPEAK POSITIVELY OF MY OWN SENSATIONS IN HIS COMPANY
SHE CLUNG TO IT
IS IT ANYTHING ABOUT MARRIAGE
SIX MONTHS LAST YEAR ON THE AFRICAN COAST WATCHING SLAVERS--THINK OF THAT
I THINK HE SAID WITH A LITTLE SIGH I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SO RESERVED WITH YOU DARLING IF I HAD HAD ANYTHING PLEASANT TO CONFIDE
AND ALTHOUGH HE APPEARED IN NOWISE OCCUPIED BY WHAT WAS PASSING BETWEEN DORCAS BRANDON AND SIR HARRY SHE PERFECTLY WELL KNEW THAT NOTHING OF IT ESCAPED HIM
I HAVE ONLY LEARNED THAT WHATEVER IS MOST PRIZED IS HARDEST TO FIND AND SPRING IS COME AGAIN CONTINUED RACHEL PASSING BY THIS LITTLE SPEECH AND MY LABOURS RECOMMENCE
WITH CHILDREN YOU KNOW I--I ALWAYS SAY THERE'S A CHANCE--BUT YOU ARE RIGHT TO LOOK THE THING IN THE FACE--AND I'LL BE HERE THE FIRST CALL IN THE MORNING
ON RECEIPT OF THE INSTRUMENT THEREFORE HE WROTE BY RETURN OF POST PRESENTING HIS RESPECTFUL COMPLIMENTS TO SIR JULIUS HOCKLEY AND DEEPLY REGRETTING THAT AS SOLICITOR OF THE WYLDER FAMILY AND THE GENTLEMAN SIC EMPOWERED TO ACT UNDER THE LETTER OF ATTORNEY IT WAS IMPERATIVE UPON HIM TO TROUBLE HIM SIR JULIUS H WITH A FEW INTERROGATORIES WHICH HE TRUSTED HE WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN ANSWERING THE FIRST WAS WHETHER HE HAD BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH MR MARK WYLDER'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE BEFORE SEEING HIM SIGN SO AS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY HIM
I AM SPEAKING AGAINST MY BROTHER'S INTEREST
IT IS UNDER 60_L
HE WAS AWARE THAT THEY WERE IN A POSITION TO ISSUE AN EXECUTION ON THE GUARANTEE FOR THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THEIR COSTS
IT IS LOOKED BACK UPON FOR ONE-HALF OF THE YEAR AND FORWARD TO FOR THE OTHER
IT IS THE FIRST TEN THAT EMERGE FROM NOTHING AND COMMENCING IN A POINT IT IS DURING THEM THAT CONSCIOUSNESS MEMORY--ALL THE FACULTIES GROW AND THE EXPERIENCE OF SENSE IS SO NOVEL CROWDED AND ASTOUNDING
I GOT IT YOU REMEMBER MORE THAN A YEAR AGO WHEN STANLEY SAID HE WAS COMING TO PAY ME A VISIT
I HAVE NOT GOT IT WITH ME
AND AS I WRITE I OPEN MY EYES AND START AND CRY CAN IT BE TWENTY FIVE-AND-TWENTY AYE BY JOVE
AND ALSO THAT HE LIED WITH TOO FERTILE AN AUDACITY
YOU LOOK AWFUL SICK AND TIRED
RETURNED THE GENTLEMAN'S GAZE
HE WAS ON THE POINT OF SPEAKING HIS MIND WHICH WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN PLEASANT TO HEAR UPON THIS PIECE OF DETECTIVE IMPERTINENCE OF HIS WIFE'S
SETTLE IT QUIETLY
HIS FACE IS FLATTENED AGAINST THE WINDOW
I DON'T CARE TO SPEAK
IS IT REALLY THE PASSION OF GREAT MINDS OR OF LITTLE
SHE WAS GRATEFUL BUT NO NOTHING COULD MOVE HER
RACHEL WAS NOT GIVEN TO HYSTERICS
THIS WILL I TRUST QUIET THEM ON THE SUBJECT OF THEIR COSTS AND ALSO PREVENT ANY LOW DODGING ON THE PART OF THE PURCHASER THIS LETTER WOULD ALMOST SEEM TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WITH A SUPERNATURAL KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS PASSING IN GYLINGDEN AND WAS CERTAINLY WELL CONTRIVED TO PREVENT THE VICAR FROM WAVERING
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT ANSWERED LAKE
BUT REALLY BUT REALLY RADIE DEAR YOU CAN'T NEED ANY CONFIRMATION MORE THAN THIS EVENING AFFORDS
SHE WAS GOING OUT FOR A LONELY TWILIGHT WALK UPON THE TERRACE WHERE MANY A BEAUTIFUL BRANDON OF OTHER DAYS THE SUNSHINE OF WHOSE SMILE GLIMMERED ONLY ON THE CANVAS THAT HUNG UPON THOSE ANCESTRAL WALLS AND WHOSE SORROWS WERE HID IN THE GRAVE AND FORGOTTEN BY THE WORLD HAD WALKED IN OTHER DAYS IN THE PRIDE OF BEAUTY OR IN THE SADNESS OF DESERTION
DO PRAY UNCLE LAKE
HE SEEMS A CLEVER FELLOW--A BIT TOO CLEVER PERHAPS--AND WAS TOO MUCH MASTER HERE I SUSPECT IN POOR DICKIE'S REIGN
AND AVAILING HIMSELF OF THE CLEAR MOONLIGHT HE STOPPED NEARLY CONFRONTING HER
I WISH I HAD DONE AS YOU SAID
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT LAD AS I DO THEN THERE CAME A SECOND CIGAR AND SOME LITTLE TIME IN LIGHTING AND FULL TWENTY ENJOYABLE PUFFS BEFORE HE RESUMED
THE WITNESS--THE WITNESS--THE DREADFUL WITNESS SHE REPEATED
AND THOUGHTFUL HE CONTINUED FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SCREWING HIS LIPS GENTLY AS WAS HIS WONT WHILE RUMINATING HIS LONG HEAD MOTIONLESS THE NAILS OF HIS LONG AND SOMEWHAT LARGE HAND TAPPING ON THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR WITH A SHARP GLANCE NOW AND THEN AT THE UNREADABLE VISAGE OF THE CAVALRY OFFICER
SHE IS GAY AT LEAST SHE USED TO BE BEFORE SHE FELL INTO THAT TRANSCENDENTAL PARSON'S HANDS--I MEAN POOR DEAR WILLIAM WYLDER
HAPPY TO SEE YOU SIR SO WELL AND STRONG AND LIKELY TO ENLIGHTEN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD FOR MANY A DAY TO COME
BUT HERS REMAINED SERENELY UNDISTURBED AND MINE DROPPED AND TURNED AWAY HASTILY
AND I'M AFRAID RACHEL YOU'LL BE INCONVENIENCED TOO YES YOU HAVE MADE HIM SAVAGE AND BRUTAL
IT WAS A BLEACHED AND A LONG-CHINNED FACE--THE COUNTENANCE OF LORNE'S PORTRAIT--ONLY MORE FADED SINISTER AND APATHETIC
NOT TWENTY
STANLEY'S UNEASINESS LEST RACHEL'S CONDUCT SHOULD COMPROMISE THEM INCREASED
BUT THAT IS ALL
EVEN SO HE HAD A LONGER WAIT THAN HE EXPECTED SOUNDS ARE HEARD SO FAR BY NIGHT
AND EVEN IN WHAT HE SAID TO ME THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT HALF BETRAYED HIM EVERY MOMENT
THOUGH THEY CANNOT SLUR OUR FAIR FAME IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEY MAY VERY SERIOUSLY AFFECT OUR PROPERTY
I SUSPECT THAT WYLDER AND LAKE TOO FELT SOMETHING OF THE SAME OMINOUS QUALM FOR I THOUGHT THEIR FACES LOOKED GLOOMY IN THE LIGHT AS THEY STOOD TOGETHER BUTTONING THEIR LOOSE WRAPPERS AND LIGHTING THEIR CIGARS
IT IS VERY SERIOUS SIR VERY
WE ARE ALL AGREED ARE NOT WE
LARKIN WAS TO REFRESH THE VILLAGE OF GYLINGDEN WITH HIS PRESENCE
I USED TO BE BRAVE
BUT YOU ARE TO REMEMBER THAT THE SECURITY WAS ALTOGETHER SPECULATIVE
I DO NOT KNOW IN THE LEAST WHAT HAD PASSED BEFORE BUT LAKE SAID HOW THE DEVIL DID HE COME IN HUSH!'WAS ALL THAT TOM WEALDON SAID LOOKING AT THE GAUNT SPECTRE WITH LESS OF FEAR THAN INQUISITIVENESS
WELL ENQUIRED THE MAJOR CONFOUNDEDLY FRIGHTENED
I HAD AN UNPLEASANT FEELING THAT MARK WYLDER WAS ABOUT SOME MISCHIEF--A SUSPICION THAT SOME GAME OF MINE AND COUNTERMINE WAS GOING ON BETWEEN HIM AND LAKE TO WHICH I HAD NO CLUE WHATSOEVER
AGAIN I HAD SERIOUS THOUGHTS OF REMOVING MY PERSON AND EFFECTS TO THE BRANDON ARMS
AND THEY SAY JOS
WITH A START RACHEL GLANCED BACK AND SAW THE PALE PECULIAR FACE OF HER BROTHER
DORCAS WHO IS ALWAYS VERY GOOD TO ME MADE ME PROMISE TO COME WHENEVER I WAS AT DRACKLEY
AND THEN WITH A LITTLE SIGH AND A SHAKE OF HER HEAD SAID NO WELL I MUST TELL DORCAS SHE WAS RIGHT--YOU ARE VERY INEXORABLE AND CRUEL I AM VERY CRUEL TO KEEP YOU HERE SO LONG--AND I TOO AM FORGETTING THE VICAR WHO WILL BE HERE IMMEDIATELY AND I MUST MEET HIM IN A COSTUME LESS LIKE THE WOMAN OF ENDOR LORD CHELFORD LEANING ON THE LITTLE WICKET PUT HIS ARM OVER AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND AGAIN
HE LIKED THESE FINE CONSOLATIONS OF THE JEWISH DISPENSATION--ACTUAL MILK AND HONEY AND A LAND OF PROMISE ON WHICH HE COULD SET HIS FOOT
WHO COULD TELL EXACTLY THE CAUSE OF HIS DISMISSAL AND WHY THE YOUNG LADY HAD ASSERTED HER CAPRICIOUS RESOLVE TO BE FREE
IT WILL HAPPEN--AND MOST OMINOUSLY I FEEL THAT YOU ARE COURTING A DREADFUL RETALIATION AND THAT YOU WILL BRING ON YOURSELF A GREAT MISFORTUNE
YOU'RE TALKING WILDLY ON PURPOSE I BELIEVE TO TERRIFY ME
I TRAVELLED AS FAR AS SHILLINGSWORTH LAST NIGHT WITH MR MARK WYLDER
UNDERMINED BY THE BROOK WHICH WAS SWOLLEN BY THE RECENT RAINS
AND DEAR SIR,--I HAVE THIS MOMENT ARRIVED FROM LONDON WHERE I DEEPLY REGRET TO STATE THE NEGOTIATION ON WHICH WE BOTH RELIED TO CARRY YOU COMFORTABLY OVER YOUR PRESENT DIFFICULTIES HAS FALLEN THROUGH IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT I CANNOT BUT REGARD AS THE INEXCUSABLE CAPRICE OF THE INTENDING PURCHASER
HE FANCIED THE EYES WERE LAUGHING
THE OLD WOMAN HAD A SECRET HATRED OF THIS PLACE AND THE UNEXPECTED SOUNDS MADE HER HOLD HER BREATH
IT WAS A GREAT DAY FOR JOS
I'LL DRAW IT QUIETLY ROUND AND ROUND--CLOSER AND CLOSER--TILL THEY CAN NEITHER BLOW NOR BUDGE AND THEN UP TO THE YARDARM THEY GO WITH WHAT BREATH IS LEFT IN THEM
SHE WAS GLAD--YES VERY GLAD
HE WAS KINDLY AND ENJOYING
WE SHALL BE OLD MAIDS YOU AND I AND LIVE TOGETHER LIKE THE LADIES OF LLANGOLLEN CARELESS AND HAPPY RECLUSES
MAJOR JACKSON WHO IS GONE TO THE TOWN TO FETCH THE DOCTOR MY LORD SAYS MR LAKE WON'T A-BEAR CARRIAGE
THE GOOD LAWYER LIKED ILLUMINATING HIS LITTLE NARRATIVES COMPLIMENTS AND REMINISCENCES WITH PLENTY OF ARMORIAL BEARINGS AND HERALDIC FIGURES AND PLAYED OUT HIS COURT-CARDS IN EASY AND SOMEWHAT OVERPOWERING PROFUSION
YOU HAVE SOME OF MY SECRETS AND YOU MUST HAVE MORE
LARKIN SOMETIMES THOUGHT ONE THING SOMETIMES ANOTHER
IT IS A MEETING THOUGHT MR LARCOM TAKING COURAGE FOR HE ALREADY FELT SOMETHING OF THE CONFIDENCE AND SUPERIORITY OF POSSESSING A SECRET
AND HE SAID QUIETLY WITH A WAVE OF HIS CANE IN THE SAME DIRECTION YES A PRECIOUS LOT OF WYLDERS IS THERE A WYLDER VAULT HERE CAPTAIN BRANDON LAKE HANGED IF I KNOW!--WHAT THE DEVIL'S THAT TO YOU OR ME SIR ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN WITH A PEEVISH SULLENNESS
THERE WAS SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL AND TALISMANIC IN THE MYSTERY
THE ATTORNEY WAS PROSPEROUS
HE COULD RECOLLECT NO SUCH NAME AS JAMES DUTTON
MISS RACHEL WILL FIND I'M NOT QUITE SUCH A LUBBER AS SHE FANCIES
AND I THINK SHE SAID DARLING CHAPTER LX
EVERY MAN MUST TASTE OF LIFE
THE MORE HE THOUGHT OVER HIS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE AND HIS INTERVIEW WITH LAKE THE MORE STEADILY RETURNED UPON HIS MIND THE OLD CONVICTION THAT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN WAS DEEP IN THE SECRET WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE
POOR DEVILS THEY HAD A NOTION I BELIEVE WE WERE GOING TO SELL THEM FOR SLAVES AND HE MADE ME A PRESENT OF A RING AND TOLD ME A LONG YARN ABOUT IT
WHEN IN A LITTLE TIME POOR DOLLY RETURNED HER WILLIE TOOK HER ROUND THE WAIST AS ON THE DAY WHEN SHE ACCEPTED HIM AND LED HER TENDERLY INTO THE OTHER ROOM AND TOLD HER ALL AND THEY HUGGED AND WEPT TOGETHER
I HAVE NOT GOT IT TO GIVE AND I DON'T THINK SHE'S FOOL ENOUGH TO EXPECT IT
SILVER TRAYS AND POWDERED FOOTMEN AND UTRECHT VELVET UPHOLSTERY--MISERABLE COMFORTERS
THEY HAD CHARADES AND PROVERBES DRAMATIQUES
THE ELECTION WAS THE PRESSING TOPIC AND LAKE WAS SOON ENGAGED IN IT AGAIN
BUT I ASSURE YOU--WHEN WILL THAT OLD WOMAN GIVE ME A CUP OF TEA?--I ASSURE YOU RADIE THERE'S NOTHING IN IT RACHEL MADE NO REPLY BUT SHE LOOKED STEADFASTLY AND UNEASILY UPON THE ENIGMATICAL FACE AND DOWNCAST EYES OF THE YOUNG MAN
MAYBE MY DEAR SIR YOU CAN THINK OF SOME CONSCIENTIOUS AND CHRISTIAN PRACTITIONER WHO IS NOT SO LADEN WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S CARES AND TROUBLES AS YOU ARE
AND BESIDE THERE'S NOTHING TO ROB AND I REALLY DON'T MUCH MIND BEING MURDERED HE LOOKED ROUND AND SMILED ON AS BEFORE LIKE A MAN CONTEMPTUOUSLY AMUSED BUT SLEEPILY WITHAL
THE FACT IS I DID NOT MYSELF BELIEVE IN THAT STEALTHY MOTION OF MY DOOR AND SET IT DOWN TO ONE OF THOSE ILLUSIONS WHICH I HAVE SOMETIMES SUCCEEDED IN ANALYSING--A HALF-SEEN COMBINATION OF OBJECTS WHICH RIGHTLY PLACED IN THE DUE RELATIONS OF PERSPECTIVE HAVE NO MUTUAL CONNECTION WHATEVER
IT WAS A REPAST SPREAD OF WHICH HE COULD NOT PARTAKE AND IT SPITED HIM
SICK ROOMS EVEN WHEN PALPABLY DOCTORS NURSES FRIENDS HAVE ALL CEASED TO HOPE ARE NOT TO THOSE WHO STAND IN THE VERY NEAREST AND MOST TENDER RELATIONS TO THE PATIENT ALTOGETHER CHAMBERS OF DESPAIR
HE HAD NOT NATURALLY A PLEASANT TEMPER--SOMEWHAT SHORT DARK AND DANGEROUS BUT BY NO MEANS NOISY
AN EXPENSIVE HOUSE--_WHERE WAS THIS NOW OH SIR MULGRAVE PRAY DON'T THINK OF IT--I'M ONLY TOO HAPPY--PRAY DRAW YOUR PEN ACROSS THE ENTIRE THING I THINK SO SAID THE BARONET UNEXPECTEDLY
THE PROCEEDINGS HAD REACHED THIS POINT WHEN AN OCCURRENCE TOOK PLACE WHICH STARTLED LORD CHELFORD LARKIN LARCOM AND EVERY ONE IN THE ROOM WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH MARK WYLDER'S APPEARANCE
AND THE PRATTLE OF CHILDREN PLAYING ON THE FLAGS AND THE SCRAPE OF A VIOLIN FROM A WINDOW WERE IN HIS EARS BUT AS IT WERE UNHEARD
NEITHER DID SHE LIKE THE STERN GLOOM THAT OVERCAST RACHEL'S COUNTENANCE WHEN STANLEY WAS IN THE ROOM NOR THOSE OCCASIONAL WALKS TOGETHER UP AND DOWN THE SHORT YEW WALK IN WHICH LAKE LOOKED SO COLD AND ANGRY AND RACHEL SO EARNEST
BLEAK AND WINTRY THAT UNGENIAL MONTH SET IN AT GYLINGDEN
JUST YOU HOIST THAT SIGNAL AND SOMEBODY WILL BEAR DOWN AND BLAZE INTO HIM AT ALL HAZARDS--YOU'LL SEE HOW
MISS CHUBLEY ALL THE SHOPKEEPERS IN THE TOWN KNEW AND LIKED AND IN A WAY RESPECTED HER AS MISS DOLLY OLD REVEREND JOHN CHUBLEY D.D WHO HAD BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE FROM THE PERIOD OF HIS BOYHOOD
AND IT WAS WELL HE HAD EXTINGUISHED HIS LIGHTS FOR AS HE DID SO CAPTAIN LAKE'S LIGHT FIGURE IN A GRAY PALETOT AND CLOTH CAP GLIDED BY LIKE A SPIRIT IN THE FAINT MOONLIGHT
AND WHEN MARGERY STRUCK BY HER FIXED AND MELANCHOLY COUNTENANCE STOPPED IN THE MIDST OF A SENTENCE THE YOUNG LADY TURNED AND GAZED ON HER WISTFULLY WITH LARGE EYES AND PALE FACE AND SIGHED HEAVILY
WAS IT BETTER TO WAIT UNTIL HE HAD SEEN DUTTON AND HEARD HIS STORY BEFORE HINTING AT HIS INTELLIGENCE AND HIS NAME--OR WAS IT WISER TO DO THAT AT ONCE AND WATCH ITS EFFECT UPON THE GALLANT CAPTAIN NARROWLY AND TRUST TO INSPIRATION AND THE MOMENT FOR STRIKING OUT THE RIGHT COURSE
NONE AT ALL
HE FANCIED THAT EXCEPTION MIGHT BE TAKEN TO HIS CHEQUE FOR SO LARGE A SUM AND WAS EAGER TO AVOID DELAY AND CAME FROM LONDON SO PROVIDED
THE GROUND UNDULATES BEAUTIFULLY AND NOBLE TIMBER STUDS IT IN ALL VARIETIES OF GROUPING
AND RACHEL LOOKED DOWN ON THE FERNS BEFORE HER FEET AS THEY WALKED ON SIDE BY SIDE NOT WITH A SMILE BUT WITH A BLUSH AND THAT BEAUTIFUL LOOK OF GRATIFICATION SO BECOMING AND INDESCRIBABLE
AND THE SUSPENSE BY NO MEANS CONDUCIVE TO TEMPER
I RATHER THINK THE CONTRARY
AS YOU LOVE YOUR LITTLE BOY LAY IT DOWN AND HEAR ME CONTINUED MISS LAKE
HE HAD STOPPED AT DOLLINGTON AS THE ATTORNEY SUSPECTED HE WOULD AND HE HAD KEPT TRYST IN THE BRANDON GROUNDS WITH SLY CAPTAIN LAKE WHOSE RELATIONS WITH HIM IT BECAME NOW MORE DIFFICULT THAN EVER CLEARLY TO COMPREHEND
BEING VERY GENTLEMANLIKE IN EXTERNALS WITH A CERTAIN GRACE AMOUNTING VERY NEARLY TO ELEGANCE AND HAVING APPLIED HIMSELF DILIGENTLY TO PLEASE THE COUNTY PEOPLE THAT PROUD FRATERNITY REMEMBERING HIS FATHER'S ESTATES CONDONED HIS POVERTY AND TOOK CAPTAIN LAKE BY THE HAND AND LIFTED HIM INTO THEIR SUPERB THOUGH NOT VERY ENTERTAINING ORDER
THE PAST IS INDEED IMMUTABLE AND THE FUTURE IS EQUALLY FIXED AND MORE DREADFUL COME RADIE
I HOPE RADIE YOU'LL BE BETTER--EVERY WAY--WHEN NEXT I SEE YOU
DON'T YOU THINK--HE MAY HAVE AN OBJECT--AND NOT BELIEVE I'M IN MUCH DANGER
THE HANDWRITING I KNEW AS ONE SOMETIMES KNOWS A FACE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO REMEMBER WHO THE PLAGUE IT BELONGS TO
AND FOR ME SELF-SACRIFICE SHE RETORTED BITTERLY
IT SETTLES THAT
WYLDER HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY RESERVED WITH ME
I GIVE IT DORCAS YOU ARE CHANGED
BUT STILL I THINK IT IMPRESSED HIM AND THAT DIPLOMATICALLY CAPTAIN LAKE WAS IN THE RIGHT TO ENVIRON HIMSELF WITH THE CEREMONIAL OF A LORD OF BRANDON
LIGHT THE CANDLES IN THE DRAWING-ROOM MARGERY AND THEN CHILD GO TO YOUR BED SAID THE YOUNG LADY AWAKENING FROM AN ABSTRACTION
IF NOT IT IS NOT FOR WANT OF DISTINCTNESS ON MY PART
I'M NOT EQUAL TO IT WE MUST GO STANLEY
IF I AM NOT IN GYLINGDEN BY MONDAY WE MUST PUT OFF THE WEDDING FOR A WEEK LATER--THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT
OR AN ELOPEMENT ANOTHER SHAKE OF THE HEAD
IN A LONG PERUKE AND DARK RED VELVET COAT FACING THE HALL-DOOR
MY MIND IS QUITE MADE UP--I AM INEXPRESSIBLY GRATEFUL--YOU WILL NEVER KNOW HOW GRATEFUL--BUT EXCEPT AS A FRIEND--AND WON'T YOU STILL BE MY FRIEND?--I NEVER CAN REGARD YOU RACHEL WAS SO PALE THAT HER VERY LIPS WERE WHITE AS SHE SPOKE THIS IN A MELANCHOLY BUT VERY FIRM WAY
YES STANLEY I KNEW YOU WERE A COWARD SHE REPLIED FIERCELY AND WILDLY
SHE IS EITHER ABSOLUTELY UNINTERESTING OR VERY INTERESTING INDEED AND I CAN'T SAY WHICH DOES SHE LIKE YOU HE ASKED
THE SITUATION PERHAPS IS BETTER
IS THIS YOURS MRS WYLDER MINE INDEED LAUGHED POOR LITTLE MRS DOROTHY
SO I FELT NO LONGER LIKE A CONSPIRATOR AND WAS TO OFFER SUCH ADVICE AS MIGHT SEEM EXPEDIENT WITH THE CLEAR APPROBATION OF MISS BRANDON'S TRUSTEE
ON THE WHOLE THEN IT WAS A DIFFICULT QUESTION
I MAY STATE HOWEVER TO YOU WITHOUT BETRAYING CONFIDENCE THAT TEN TIMES THAT SUM WOULD NOT AVAIL TO EXTRICATE HIM EVEN TEMPORARILY FROM HIS DIFFICULTIES
AND IF SHE OR MRS WILLIAM WYLDER THE VICAR'S WIFE SHOULD CALL TO SEE ME ALWAYS SAY I'M ASLEEP AND A LITTLE BETTER
WHEN MOSES WENT TO SPEAK WITH GOD SAYS THE ADMIRABLE HALL HE PULLED OFF HIS VEIL
THERE WAS NO LOOK OF LIKING THOUGH SOME FAINT GLIMMERINGS BOTH OF ANNOYANCE AND EMBARRASSMENT IN HER FACE
FROM MY OBSERVATION OF HIM I AM CERTAIN OF TWO THINGS--I AM SURE THAT HE HAS SOME REASON FOR THINKING THAT YOUR BROTHER MARK WYLDER IS DEAD
THINKIN I MIGHT BE MISTOOK ANSWERED THE MAN
BUT I'LL LEAVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT MORE MY SENSE AND DECENCY WITH A REQUEST THAT YOU WILL USE THEM FOR MY SAKE YOU'RE A DEVILISH WITTY FELLOW LAKE
VERY HOT INDEED
THEY TALKED A LONG WHILE--RACHEL CHIEFLY A LISTENER AND OFTEN QUIETLY WEEPING
WHEN LAKE WITH A LITTLE SHUDDER FOR IT WAS GROWING CHILL LIFTED UP HIS YELLOW EYES SUDDENLY AND RECOLLECTED WHERE HE WAS THE COMMON HAD GROWN DARK AND WAS QUITE DESERTED
AFTER A WHILE WITH AN OATH HE EXCLAIMED THAT'S HIM THEN AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE HE GASPED ANOTHER OATH IT IS HIM THE SQUARE-BUILT MAN IN THE SURTOUT HAD A GREAT PAIR OF BLACK WHISKERS
I WANT YOUR OPINION SO SHE FLOATED ON AND I ACCOMPANIED HER
BUT QUITE TRUE LADY CHELFORD ANSWERED MISS BRANDON HAUGHTILY
WYLDERS AND CHELFORDS AT THIS MOMENT MISS BRANDON ENTERED WITH HER BRILLIANT COUSIN RACHEL
WAS SHE ILL?--AND SHE THOUGHT HOW LONELY SHE WOULD BE IF RACHEL WERE TO DIE--HOW LONELY SHE WAS NOW
AND THUS COMFORTING HIMSELF HE MET OLD MAJOR JACKSON ON THE GREEN AND THAT GENTLEMAN'S STATEMENT ENDED WITH THE WORDS
OR ASK PRETTY MRS FUSIBLE ON YOUR RIGHT TO ELOPE WITH YOU FROM HER GRINNING AND GABBLING LORD WHOSE BALD HEAD FLASHES RED WITH CHAMPAGNE ONLY AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE
MR MARK WYLDER PLEASE
CAN YOU CONJECTURE WHY HE IS GONE RACHEL MADE NO ANSWER BUT ROSE WITH A DREAMY LOOK AS IF GAZING AT SOME DISTANT OBJECT AMONG THE DARK MASSES OF FOREST TREES AND STOOD BEFORE THE WINDOW SO LOOKING ACROSS THE TINY GARDEN
DORCAS HAD ALWAYS PUZZLED HER--NOT INDEED SO MUCH LATTERLY--BUT THIS NIGHT THE MYSTERY BEGAN TO DARKEN ONCE MORE
THE DOUBLE-CHINNED AND FLORID PROPRIETOR OF THE BRANDON ARMS WITH A BRANDY-AND-WATER FAMILIARITY OFFERED CAPTAIN LAKE TWO TO ONE ON THE GAME IN ANYTHING HE LIKED WHICH THE CAPTAIN DECLINED AND TOOK HIS SEAT ON THE BENCH
AND PRAY HOW DO YOU AMUSE YOURSELF HERE
ON THE LITTLE FINGER SOMETHING GLIMMERED DULLY
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY CIVIL TO ME BUT WE DON'T LIKE ONE ANOTHER
IT WAS VILLAINOUS IN HIM TO SEEK TO MARRY YOU
I FEEL A LITTLE ILL
SHREWD FELLOWS WONDERED AS THEY ALWAYS DO WHEN A RASH GAME BREAKS DOWN AT THE INFATUATION OF THE PERFORMER
I BELIEVE THE BEST RULE IN TELLING A STORY IS TO FOLLOW EVENTS CHRONOLOGICALLY
IS IT YOU AND BEFORE HE COULD ANSWER SHE HAD THROWN HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK AND KISSED HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES
I KNOW WHERE HE IS RESUMED THE OLD MAN WITH HIS FINGER ON HIS LONG CHIN AND LOOKING DOWN UPON THE CARPET
HE WALKED ON HOWEVER WITHOUT QUICKENING HIS PACE WAVING VERY SLIGHTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE HIS EBONY WALKING-CANE--THIN AS A PENCIL--AS IF IT WERE A WAND TO BECKON AWAY THE UNSEEN THINGS THAT HAUNT THE DARKNESS
CAPTAIN LAKE WAS AT HOME AS USUAL UP TO ONE O'CLOCK IN THE LIBRARY--THE MOST DILIGENT ADMINISTRATOR THAT BRANDON HAD PERHAPS EVER KNOWN
LITTLE FAIRY
AND IF IT SHOULD MISCARRY WHAT INEVITABLE RUIN YAWNED BEFORE HIM
BUT HE WAS NOW SURE THAT HIS FELLOW-TRAVELLER WAS AN ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD PROBABLY RECOGNISED HIM
AND SUDDENLY WITH AN EXCEEDING BITTER CRY SHE STOOD UP CLOSE TO HIM SEIZING HIM IN HER TINY HANDS BY THE COLLAR AND WITH WILD EYES GAZING INTO HIS SHE SAID SEE WHAT YOU'VE BROUGHT ME TO--WRETCH WRETCH WRETCH AND SHE SHOOK HIM WITH VIOLENCE AS SHE SPOKE
I HOPE YOU DO NOT THINK IT RUDE--BUT I NEVER DO MISS BRANDON CAN MAKE WHAT LAWS SHE PLEASES FOR ALL HERE AND FOR SOME OF US EVERYWHERE HE REPLIED WITH A MORTIFIED SMILE AND A BOW
MY HANDS ARE CLEAN
A LONG LETTER FROM STANLEY LAKE TOLD LORD CHELFORD IN DETAIL ALL THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THAT ENERGETIC YOUNG GENTLEMAN FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THE TRUANT KNIGHT I HAVE BEEN AT HIS CLUB REPEATEDLY AS ALSO AT HIS LODGINGS--STILL HIS THOUGH HE HAS NOT APPEARED THERE SINCE HIS ARRIVAL IN TOWN
THE THOUGHT HE WOULD NOT ALLOW NEAR HIM
SO MR LARKIN WAS ON THE PLATFORM AND HIS BELONGINGS STOWED AWAY AGAINST THE WALL OF THE STATION-HOUSE
I'VE AS DEEP AN INTEREST IN IT AS YOU
LORD CHELFORD WOULD HAVE WRITTEN AT ONCE TO REMONSTRATE WITH MARK ON THE UNSEEMLINESS OF PUTTING OFF HIS MARRIAGE SO CAPRICIOUSLY OR AT ALL EVENTS SO MYSTERIOUSLY--MISS BRANDON NOT BEING CONSIDERED NOR HER FRIENDS CONSULTED
ONLY THINK--A SLAVE
WYLDER'S ATTORNEY HAD DONE HIS DEVOIR AND MR LARKIN AVOWED A SORT OF PARENTAL INTEREST IN BOTH PARTIES TO THE INDENTURES AND MADE AT CLOSING A LITTLE SPEECH VERY HIGH IN MORALITY AND FLAVOURED IN A MANLY WAY WITH RELIGION AND CONGRATULATED MARK ON HIS HONOUR AND PLAIN DEALING WHICH HE GAVE US TO UNDERSTAND WERE THE SECRETS OF ALL SUCCESS IN LIFE AS THEY HAD BEEN IN AN HUMBLE WAY OF HIS OWN
YES VALLOMBROSA--AYE ITALY I KNOW IT WELL SO DO WE SIR
IT WOULD PREJUDICE THE BETRAYER AT LEAST AS MUCH AS THE BETRAYED
I SHOULD OBLITERATE MY PAST SELF ALTOGETHER
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER STANLEY LAKE FELT ANYTHING OF THIS BEING VERY DECIDEDLY OF THE EARTH EARTHY
AND NOW WITH A STRANGE SURPRISE HOW VIVIDLY REMEMBERED AND HOW AFFECTIONATELY GREETED
AND TO SAY TRUTH AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME I HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY--SO WELL ACQUAINTED WAS I WITH THE ACTORS AND THE SCENERY--IN DETERMINING WITHOUT CONSULTING MY DIARY WHAT PORTIONS OF THE NARRATIVE I RELATE FROM HEARSAY AND WHAT AS A SPECTATOR
YOUNG AS HE WAS STANLEY LAKE WAS AN OLD MAN OF THE WORLD NOT TO BE DISCONCERTED AND NEVER SAW MORE THAN EXACTLY SUITED HIM
THE BLACK YEW HEDGE WAS A PERFECT SCREEN
CHAPTER XXXI
CHAPTER XL
I MAY YET HAVE TO RETRACT MY SECRET OH
HE LOOKED IN HER FACE WITH A GLAZED AND ASHY STARE
SCARCE A MAN OR WOMAN IN THE SHIRE BUT HAD A THEORY OR A STORY--SOMETIMES BEARING HARD ON THE LADY SOMETIMES ON THE GENTLEMAN
THEN HE PULLED IT UP AND TOOK TO HIS NEWSPAPER AGAIN AND READ THE POLICE CASES AND A VERY CURIOUS LETTER FROM A POOR-HOUSE DOCTOR DESCRIBING A BOY WHO WAS QUITE BLIND IN DAYLIGHT BUT COULD SEE VERY FAIRLY BY GAS OR CANDLE LIGHT AND THEN HE LIGHTED UPON A VERY ODD STORY AND SAID TO BE UNDERGOING SPECIAL SIFTING AT THE HANDS OF SIR SAMUEL SQUAILES OF A POLICEMAN ON A CERTAIN BEAT IN FLEET STREET NOT FAR FROM TEMPLE BAR WHO EVERY NIGHT SAW AT OR ABOUT THE SAME HOUR A CERTAIN SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING FIGURE WALK ALONG THE FLAG-WAY AND ENTER A PASSAGE
I WAS THINKING RACHEL YOU COULD ADVISE ME IF YOU WOULD YOU ARE SO CLEVER YOU KNOW ADVISE SAID RACHEL SOFTLY
HOW DARED RACHEL CONFER WITH HIM--INFLUENCE HIM PERHAPS UNDER HER VERY EYE WALKING BEFORE THE WINDOWS OF BRANDON--THAT BRANDON WHICH WAS HERS AND TO WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN STANLEY PASSING HER GATE A POOR AND TIRED WAYFARER OF THE WORLD AND MADE HIM--_WHAT OH MAD CAPRICE
LORD CHELFORD RAISED HIS HAT SMILING
AND YOU MEANT TO KEEP IT ALL TO YOURSELF
LAKE KNEW THAT HIS FACE HAD BETRAYED HIM
BUT I SUPPOSE EVERY FELLOW FEELS A LITTLE QUEER WHEN HE IS GOING TO BE SPLICED A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS EH
YOU'RE MISERABLY POOR RACHEL
AND FORTHWITH WEALDON TOOK THE COMMAND
I DON'T SEE EXACTLY HOW MY LORD SAID MR LARKIN A LITTLE LOFTILY AND REDDER THAN USUAL
BUT THEN DON'T YOU SEE IT IS YOUR OWN FAULT IF YOU MAKE IT A QUESTION OF RIGHT WHEN YOU MAY MAKE IT ALTOGETHER ONE OF FASCINATION WHO PRAY IS DISPUTING THE HUSBAND'S RIGHT TO RULE DEMANDED OLD LADY CHELFORD UNEXPECTEDLY
NO ONE SEEMED TO CARE EXCEPT POOR OLD TAMAR WHETHER I EVER SAID A PRAYER OR HEARD ANY GOOD THING
HE KNEELED DOWN IN THE STUDY--'LITTLE MAN'S TOP AND SOME CUT PAPER NONDESCRIPTS WERE LYING WHERE HE HAD LEFT THEM AT HIS ELBOW--AND HE TRIED TO PRAY AND THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS DARLING OUGHT TO KNOW THAT HE WAS GOING INTO THE PRESENCE OF HIS MAKER
BUT WHEN YOU SAW RACHEL AND ME TALKING TOGETHER OR RATHER RACHEL TALKING TO ME I DO ASSURE YOU DORCAS UPON MY SACRED HONOUR ONE HALF OF WHAT SHE SAID I DO NOT TO THIS MOMENT COMPREHEND AND THE WHOLE WAS BASED ON THE MOST PREPOSTEROUS BLUNDER
THERE'S SOME WINE IN THE PRESS I THINK HE TRIED TO OPEN IT BUT HIS HAND SHOOK
YES STANLEY IT DOES CONCERN ME THAT IS FALSE TRUE TRUE SIR
IT WAS A SPECTRE OF MIST THAT EVAPORATED BEFORE SHE COULD FIX HER EYES ON IT BUT WAS ALWAYS NEAR HER ELBOW
YOU MEAN TO THREATEN ME WOMAN SAID HE WITH A PALE MALEVOLENT LOOK
YOU MUST NOT DISMISS YOUR ESCORT HERE
THE CAPTAIN WAS SULLEN THAT EVENING AT HOME
HOWEVER I MAY MENTION THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE LETTER YOU AUTHORISED ME TO WRITE AND GUARANTEED BY YOUR BOND ON WHICH THEY HAVE ENTERED JUDGMENT THEY HAVE GONE TO THE ENTIRE EXPENSE OF DRAWING THE DEEDS AND INVESTIGATING TITLE AND THEY SAY THAT THE PURCHASER WILL POSITIVELY BE OFF UNLESS THE ARTICLES ARE IN THEIR OFFICE BY TWELVE O'CLOCK TO-MORROW
I WAS THINKING CAPTAIN LAKE WHETHER IN THE EVENT OF ITS TURNING OUT THAT MR MARK WYLDER WAS DEAD IT WOULD BE THOUGHT PROPER TO LAY HIS BODY HERE DEAD SIR!--AND WHAT THE PLAGUE PUTS THAT IN YOUR HEAD
A METAPHYSICAL MICROSCOPE OF NO CONCEIVABLE POWER COULD HAVE DEVELOPED ITS EXACT SHAPE AND COLOUR--A MERE SPECK FLOATING AS IT WERE IN A TRANSPARENT KYST IN HIS SOUL--A MERE GERM--BY-AND-BY TO BE AN IMPISH EMBRYO AND RIPE FOR ACTION
IN THE RUDE MASS AT THE FAR ANGLE MR JOS
THE WHOLE THING SEEMED LIKE YESTERDAY
AT THE HALL WILL CLEAR ALL UP
IN A SHORT TIME THE SAME VOICE WITH THE SAME UNCERTAIN ECHO AMONG THE TREES CRIED FAINTLY MARK--MARK AND THEN A PAUSE
BUT I DON'T SEE THAT I CAN BE OF ANY USE TO HIM OR WHY THE DEVIL I SHOULD
HE WOULD HAVE HIS PICTURES AND HIS PEDIGREE
AT EVERY SACRIFICE TO BE QUITE HONEST
WILLIAM WYLDER AT THREE O'CLOCK PERFORMED HIS HOLY OFFICE IN READING-DESK AND PULPIT THE GOOD FOLK FROM GYLINGDEN ASSEMBLED IN FORCE SAW NOTHING NOTICEABLE IN THE DEMEANOUR OR APPEARANCE OF THE GREAT BRANDON HEIRESS
NOW I MAY AS WELL MENTION HERE AN OCCURRENCE WHICH SEEMING VERY INSIGNIFICANT HAS YET A BEARING UPON THE CURRENT OF THIS TALE AND IT IS THIS
THE MOON HAD GONE DOWN
LARKIN OF THE LODGE HAD BEGUN TO PUT BY MONEY SO FAST THAT HE WAS GROWING RAPIDLY TO BE A VERY CONSIDERABLE MAN INDEED
AND SO IT IS WITH OUR REMEMBRANCE OF THE IMMORTAL PART
DID YOU SEE HIM LOOKING UP SAID UNCLE LORNE WITH HIS PALLID SMILE
THERE'S NOT A LETTER SIR I EVER WRITE OR RECEIVE THAT MIGHT NOT SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED WITH MY GOOD WILL LIE OPEN ON THAT TABLE FOR EVERY VISITOR THAT COMES IN TO READ;--OPEN AS THE DAY SIR AND THE ATTORNEY WAVED HIS HAND GRANDLY
I HEAR THE PONY-CARRIAGE
HE COULD SCARCELY TURN HIS HEAD AND LOOK UP BESEECHINGLY FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES
I DARE SAY MR LARKIN WOULD HAVE HAD AS LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN REFERRING THE GALLANT CAPTAIN TO THE SAME FAMILY
THE FIRE WAS VERY LOW WHEN I AWOKE AND SAW A FIGURE--AND A VERY ODD ONE--SEATED BY THE EMBERS AND STOOPING OVER THE GRATE WITH A PAIR OF LONG HANDS EXPANDED AS IT SEEMED TO CATCH THE WARMTH OF THE SINKING FIRE
PITY IT WAS SHE HAD EVER HAD A SECRET TO KEEP
THE WORLD WOULD NOT TOLERATE IT
OH I KNOW--THAT'S LORNE BRANDON
WHY SHOULD HE DREAD THIS CABAL AS HE CALLED IT EVEN THOUGH DIRECTED BY THE MALIGNANT ENERGY OF THE ABSENT AND SHADOWY MARK WYLDER
I DON'T LIKE BLACK HAIR
DON'T YOU THINK MR LARKIN YOU COULD PERHAPS REDUCE THIS JUST A LITTLE AH THE EXPENSES WELL YES MR JOS
IT IS SIMPLY SIR THAT THIS YOUNG LADY REPRESENTS CAPTAIN LAKE WHO WISHES TO GET THE REVERSION FOR HIMSELF THAT IS UTTERLY FALSE SIR SAID MISS LAKE FLASHING AND BLUSHING WITH INDIGNATION
AND IF IT BE AS BODIES USUALLY ARE AFTER SUCH A TIME HOW CAN ANYBODY PRETEND TO IDENTIFY IT
I NEED NOT REMIND YOU NOT TO MENTION I CANNOT OF COURSE SAY HOW MR LARKIN'S CONJECTURES REACHED SO PRODIGIOUS AN ELEVATION BUT I CAN NOW COMPREHEND WHY IT WAS DESIRABLE THAT THIS SURPRISING ESTIMATE OF THE VICAR'S LIABILITIES SHOULD PREVAIL
MARK HAD THE FRANKNESS OF CALLOSITY AND COULD RECOUNT HIS EVIL DEEDS AND CONFESS HIS VICES WITH HILARITY AND DETAIL AND WAS PROMPT TO TAKE HIS PART IN A LARK AND WAS A REMARKABLY HARD HITTER AND NEVER SHRANK FROM THE BRUNT OF THE ROW
AND IN FACT OF LATE YEARS MR JOS
LARKIN'S PROPERTIES WERE HANDSOME AND IMPOSING AND HE NEVER PLAYED WITH CHILDREN WITHOUT PRODUCING HIS GOLD REPEATER AND MAKING IT STRIKE AND EXHIBITING ITS WONDERS FOR THEIR AMUSEMENT AND THE EDIFICATION OF THE ADULTS WHOSE PRESENCE OF COURSE HE FORGOT
LARKIN ENTERED POINTEDLY AND BRIEFLY INTO MISS LAKE'S OFFER WHICH HE CHARACTERISED AS WHOLLY NUGATORY ILLUSORY AND CHIMERICAL TOLD HIM HE HAD SPOKEN ON THE SUBJECT YESTERDAY EVENING TO THE YOUNG LADY WHO NOW SAW PLAINLY THAT THERE REALLY WAS NOTHING IN IT AND THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO CARRY OUT THAT PART OF HER PROPOSITION WHICH CONTEMPLATED A RESIDENCE IN THE VICAR'S FAMILY
NOTWITHSTANDING ALL WHICH HE WAS SOMEHOW UNLOVELY IN MY EYES AND IN AN INDISTINCT WAY FORMIDABLE
THEN TERRA TENEBROSA
SOME IN OLD-FASHIONED COACHES
I THOUGHT STANLEY YOU WERE IN LONDON SO I WAS
HE'S VERY TIRED NURSE SAID RACHEL
YOU DON'T SEEM TO COMPREHEND THE TREMENDOUS MISFORTUNE THAT MENACES ME--_US_--_YOU AND ME AND HE CURSED MARK WYLDER WITH A GASP OF HATRED NOT EASILY EXPRESSED
I HOPE I MAY NEVER DESIRE TO SEE YOU ALONE AGAIN BUT IF I DO IT SHALL NOT BE TO RECEIVE BUT TO IMPOSE COMMANDS
AND HER DARK COUSIN DORCAS DRIVES DOWN SOMETIMES IN THE PONY-CARRIAGE AND IS NOT ALWAYS SILENT
MINGLED WITH THIS CRITICISM WAS A FEELING QUITE UNAVOWED EVEN TO HERSELF--A SORE FEELING THAT LORD CHELFORD HAD BEEN--AND THIS SHE NEVER ADMITTED TO HERSELF BEFORE--MORE PARTICULAR--NO NOT EXACTLY THAT--BUT MORE SOMETHING OR OTHER--NOT EXACTLY EXPRESSIBLE IN WORDS IN HIS APPROACHES TO HER THAN WAS CONSISTENT WITH HIS SITUATION
HOW FRIENDS ARE RAISED UP AND WITH A SMILE THAT SHONE LIKE AN APRIL SUN THROUGH HER TEARS SHE STOOD ON TIPTOE AND KISSED THE TALL YOUNG LADY WHO--NOT SMILING BUT WITH A PALE AND VERY TROUBLED FACE--BOWED DOWN AND RETURNED HER KISS
THAT D--D GIRL DESERVES TO BE SHOT FOR HER TREACHERY WAS THE FIRST SENTENCE THAT BROKE FROM HIS WHITE LIPS
DOES NOT BRUTALITY IN OUR SEX AND EVEN RASCALITY INTEREST THEM SOMETIMES
LAKE ADDRESSED THE DRIVER YOU COME FROM JOHNSON'S HOTEL--DON'T YOU--AT DOLLINGTON YES SIR WELL I'LL PAY YOU HALF-FARE TO BRING ME THERE ALL RIGHT SIR
AND THE GAME PROCEEDED WITH ANIMATION AND NO LACK OF LAUGHTER BEGUILING THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT
IT IS WHAT THEY CALL A REVERSION WILLIAM WYLDER IS NOT SELLING HIS REVERSION SAID RACHEL FIXING A WILD AND STARTLED LOOK ON HER COMPANION
IF HE HAD OF COURSE I SHOULD NOT HAVE MENTIONED IT
LOOKING ROUND ME IN A SORT OF DREAM I REMEMBERED SUDDENLY WHAT WYLDER HAD TOLD ME OF OLD LORNE BRANDON TO WHOSE PORTRAIT THIS INEXPLICABLE PHANTOM BORE SO POWERFUL A RESEMBLANCE
THERE IS HOWEVER ONE SATISFACTORY CIRCUMSTANCE DISCLOSED IN HIS LAST LETTER
LOTS OF RATS I FANCY RADIE BEHIND THAT WAINSCOTING
QUITE THE CONTRARY--A VERY LAWLESS MATTER INDEED
IF HE KEEPS A SECRET FROM ME AFFECTING ALL HIS BUSINESS RELATIONS LIKE THIS AND DRIVING HIM ABOUT THE WORLD LIKE AN ABSCONDING BANKRUPT HOW CAN I ADVISE HIM ALL THIS DRIFTED SLOWLY THROUGH HIS MIND AND EACH SUGGESTION HAD ITS COLLATERAL SPECULATIONS
THE ATTORNEY KNEW HOWEVER THAT THE DANGER WAS QUITE APPRECIATED AND WENT ON YOU WILL THEREFORE WANT A COMPETENT MAN--WHO HAS THE PAPERS AT HIS FINGERS ENDS AND KNOWS HOW TO DEAL ABLY--_ABLY SIR WITH A FELLOW OF JAMES DUTTON'S STAMP--AT YOUR ELBOW
CAN HE KNOW ANYTHING
THERE MAY BE SOMETHING IN WHAT LARCOM SAID--A VERY GREAT DEAL POSSIBLY
THAT YOU WERE PERHAPS WELL SATISFIED WITH YOUR FIRST DAY'S PROGRESS BUT THE NEXT MADE NO HEAD-WAY
AND A LETTER UNOPENED AND SEALED WITH LORD CHELFORD'S SEAL
RACHEL HAD OPENED HER WINDOW-SHUTTERS AS WAS HER WONT WHEN THE MOON WAS UP AND WITH HER SMALL WHITE HANDS ON THE WINDOW-SASH LOOKED INTO THE WOODED SOLITUDES LOST IN HAUNTED DARKNESS IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT ONE AND THERE MASSED IN VAPOROUS AND DISCOLOURED FOLIAGE HARDLY MORE DISTINCT OR LESS SOLEMN
CAPTAIN BRANDON LAKE WAS A VERY PUNCTUAL CHURCH-GOER SINCE THE IDEA OF TRYING THE COUNTY AT THE NEXT ELECTION HAD ENTERED HIS MIND
SO MISS DORCAS MUST PACK AND TURN OUT WHENEVER I DIE THAT IS IF I SLIP MY CABLE FIRST
THERE IS A STRANGE MYSTERY AND POWER IN THE APATHETIC AND IN THAT UNAFFECTED CARELESSNESS EVEN DEFIANCE OF OPINION AND CRITICISM WHICH I HAD SEEN HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SO BEAUTIFULLY EMBODIED
HE HAD LOST HIS HAT TOO AMONG THE THICKETS AND COULD NOT TAKE TIME TO RECOVER IT
THAT EVENING CAPTAIN LAKE WAS IN LONDON COMFORTABLY QUARTERED IN A PRIVATE HOTEL IN ONE OF THE STREETS OFF PICCADILLY
AND IT WAS THOUGHT THAT SIR HARRY WAS GOING TO CANVASS THE TOWN
WHAT DID IT PORTEND
THERE WAS IN FACT NO WAY OF ACCOUNTING FOR IT THAT WAS ALTOGETHER COMPLIMENTARY TO HIS RESPECTED AND NUTRITIOUS CLIENT
AND SO IN A SULK WITHOUT MAKING HIS ADIEUX HE MARCHED OFF TO HIS CRIB AT THE BRANDON ARMS
HER FACE WAS PALE AND HER CHEEKS WET WITH TEARS WHICH SHE DID NOT WIPE AWAY
WHEN THE POOR VICAR RECEIVED THIS LATTER BLOW HE LAID THE PALM OF HIS HAND ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AS IF TO PREVENT HIS BRAIN FROM BOILING OVER
YES SHE IS--SHE'S VERY WELL
AND I THINK MATTERS ARE PRETTY WELL ARRANGED TO DISAPPOINT THE KIND INTENTION OF GOOD UNCLE WYLDER--THE BRUTE
IT SHUT WITH A SPRING LOCK OF WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE HAD A LATCH-KEY
YOU MAY PLAN WITH YOUNG CAESAR BORGIA ON YOUR LEFT THE POISONING OF YOUR HOST
IN THE DEWS OF NIGHT THE SPIRIT OF PEACE AND SLUMBERS SMILED OVER IT
LITTLE FAIRY WAS SO PLEASED WITH HIS VISIT TO REDMAN'S FARM TO-DAY
IT COMES FROM BURLINGTON AND SMITH
THE BELL WAS BEATING ONE AS I REMEMBER PRECISELY AS THAT KING OF GHOSTS OLD HAMLET REVISITED THE GLIMPSES OF THE MOON UPON THE FAMOUS PLATFORM OF ELSINORE
LARCOM RECEIVED HIM GRAVELY IN THE HALL
THEY ARE OWLS
SHE DID NOT BID HIM WELCOME OR EVEN SPEAK
BUT THE FACT OF BEING MISUNDERSTOOD SHALL NOT DETER ME FROM THE DISCHARGE OF A SIMPLE DUTY IF IT IS PART OF YOUR DUTY SIR TO MAKE YOURSELF INTELLIGIBLE MAY I BEG THAT YOU WILL DO IT WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY MY PRINCIPAL OBJECT IN CALLING HERE WAS TO INFORM YOU MISS LAKE THAT YOU MUST QUITE ABANDON THE IDEA OF RESIDING IN THE VICAR'S HOUSE AS YOU PROPOSED UNLESS YOU WISH ME TO STATE EXPLICITLY TO HIM AND TO MRS WYLDER THE INSURMOUNTABLE OBJECTIONS WHICH EXIST TO ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENT
IT IS MARK WYLDER SAID UNCLE LORNE
IT WAS QUITE DELIGHTFUL
LARKIN HAD EACH PROJECTED FOR HIMSELF PRETTY MUCH THE SAME CAREER
AND HUDDLING ON HER CLOTHES AND MUTTERING TO HERSELF ALL THE WAY SHE GOT INTO THE HALL AND STANDING A COUPLE OF YARDS AWAY FROM THE DOOR ANSWERED IN SHRILL AND QUERULOUS TONES AND QUESTIONING THE MESSENGER IN THE SAME BREATH
AND SHE SAT DOWN UNDER THE GRAY STONE WHICH STOOD PERPENDICULARLY THERE ON WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN THE STEP OF A STILE LEANING AGAINST THE RUDE COLUMN BEHIND HER
LAKE CERTAINLY MADE TWO VISITS TO LONDON ONE OF THEM OF A WEEK'S DURATION
CAPTAIN LAKE AFTER HIS CUSTOM GLARED A SINGLE FULL LOOK UPON THE ATTORNEY SUDDEN AS THE FLASH OF A PAIR OF GUNS FROM THEIR EMBRASURES IN THE DARK
HE WAS SMILING SILENTLY AND SLILY ON RACHEL WHO WITH A LITTLE CRY OF SURPRISE SAID OH STANLEY
OURS NEVER PROSPERS
SWIVELL I SEE VOTED IN THE MAJORITY
DISCOLOURED AND DISFIGURED AS WERE BOTH CLOTHES AND BODY I WAS SURE THAT THE DEAD MAN WAS NO OTHER THAN MARK WYLDER
YOU ARE STAYING AT BRANDON SAID RACHEL NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY
YOU ARE COLD MISS RADIE AND TIRED--POOR THING
THE LORD FORGIVE ME--I'M DECEIVING HER HE DID NOT LIKE THE TONE AND LOOK WHICH ACCOMPANIED THIS
SOLEMN THOUGHTS SIR--SOLEMN THOUGHTS CAPTAIN LAKE--SILENT MENTORS ELOQUENT MONITORS AND HE WAVED HIS LONG LANK HAND TOWARD THE MONUMENTAL GROUPS
IN LIKE MANNER HE COMPARES THE RECEPTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF ETERNAL LIFE INTO THE SOUL TO THE DROPPING OF A SEED INTO THE EARTH
HE WAS DETERMINED IF HE COULD TO PULL HIM THROUGH THIS
THE DEVIL IN SUCH A MOUTH WAS SO APPALLING AND SO AMAZING THAT THE WORTHY WOMAN GAZED THUNDER-STRUCK UPON HIM FOR A MOMENT
I SAY--I KNOW_--ALL THE ODDS ARE AGAINST US
AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT MARK WYLDER IS LIVING HE ADDED SUDDENLY
IT MUST BE ADMITTED HOWEVER THAT HIS PRIDE WAS NOT OF THAT STAMP WHICH WOULD PREVENT HIM FROM LISTENING TO OTHER MEN'S PRIVATE TALK OR READING THEIR LETTERS IF ANYTHING WERE TO BE GOT BY IT
AS SHE CAME TO THIS PLATFORM ROUND WHICH THE TREES RECEDED A LITTLE SO AS TO ADMIT THE MOONLIGHT THE OLD WOMAN WAS TIRED
YOU'LL COME THEN SAID STANLEY
AND--LOOK NOW--IS NOT IT MAGNIFICENT SHE ARRESTED THE FILE OF GENTLEMEN JUST BY A LARGE LAMP BEFORE WHOSE EFFULGENCE SHE PRESENTED THE SUBJECT OF HER EULOGY--ONE OF THOSE COSTLY TRIFLES WHICH ANNOUNCE THE APPROACH OF HYMEN AS FLOWERS SPRING UP BEFORE THE ROSY STEPS OF MAY
THERE ARE MANY THINGS BEST NOT CONJECTURED ABOUT AT ALL--SOME INTERESTING SOME ABOMINABLE SOME THAT PASS ALL COMPREHENSION
AND I AM SO GLAD YOU ADVISE ME TO GO ON
AND HAS A SORT OF LAZINESS--MENTAL BODILY AND MORAL--THAT IS SUBLIME BUT PROVOKING
YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION TO TRAVEL
HE PUT HIS HAND TO WHERE HIS HAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN TOKEN OF SALUTATION AND SAID HE I BEG PARDON MISS LAKE MA'AM BUT I'M SORRY TO SAY YOUR BROTHER THE CAPTAIN'S BADLY HURT AND MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE A SHAKEDOWN IN THE PARLOUR READY FOR HIM BY THE TIME I COME BACK WITH THE DOCTOR MA'AM RACHEL SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW WAS CLOSE BY THE WHEEL OF THE VEHICLE BY THIS TIME
I WAS ENTIRELY DECEIVED--YOU KNOW I SPEAK TRUTH--QUITE DECEIVED
SHE AND HER SON WERE IT SEEMED NOT ONLY TO THINK AND ACT BUT TO FEEL ALSO FOR THIS UTTERLY IMMOVABLE YOUNG LADY
AND DORCAS IS SO SUPINE I BELIEVE SHE WOULD ALLOW HERSELF TO BE GIVEN AWAY BY ANYONE AND TO ANYONE RATHER THAN BE AT THE LEAST TROUBLE
AND THE BUSINESS OF THE REV
AND THAT EXHAUSTED MR LARKIN SAT AS USUAL WITH ONE LONG THIGH CROSSED UPON THE OTHER--HIS ARM THROWN OVER THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR AND HIS TALL BALD HEAD A LITTLE BACK AND HIS SMALL MILD EYES TWINKLING THROUGH THEIR PINK LIDS ON THE ENIGMATICAL CAPTAIN WHO HAD ENTERED UPON THE MARCH OF AMBITION IN A SPIRIT SO AUDACIOUS AND CONQUERING
GRADUALLY HE RECOVERED HIS SELF-POSSESSION
LITTLE FAIRY'S DRUM WAS HANGING FROM A PEG ON THE HAT-STAND--THE DRUM THAT WAS TO SOUND NO MORE IN THE GARDEN OR UP AND DOWN THE HALL WITH THE BRIGHT-HAIRED LITTLE DRUMMER'S SONG
NOW INDEED THEY WERE MEEK AND SAD AND PINK
AND WAS SURE TOO THAT YOUNG LADIES LOST NOTHING BY A LITTLE RESERVE AND MODESTY
WE DON'T CORRESPOND
I'M SORRY
IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE EVEN THAT HE WAS WANDERING FROM PLACE TO PLACE UNDER THE COERCION OF A COUPLE OF KEEPERS
LAUGHTER THROUGH TEARS GREETED THESE PLEASANTRIES
BUT THAT IS ALL TRIFLING COMPARED WITH OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
HOW D'YE DO DEAR LARKIN SAID CAPTAIN BRANDON STANLEY LAKE THE HERO OF ALL THIS DEBATE AND COMMOTION SMILING HIS CUSTOMARY SLY GREETING AND EXTENDING HIS SLIM HAND ACROSS THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR--'I'M SO SORRY YOU WERE AWAY--THIS THING HAS COME AFTER ALL SO SUDDENLY--WE ARE GETTING ON FAMOUSLY THOUGH--BUT I'M AWFULLY FAGGED AND INDEED HE LOOKED PALE AND TIRED THOUGH SMILING
AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF IT--IT IS VERY PRETTY AND HE LAUGHED A GENTLE LITTLE LAUGH GLANCING OVER THE TINY GARDEN
IT WAS NOT A BAD DOT
I THINK I KNOW THE FEELING SAID MISS LAKE QUIETLY
BUT HERE HE FAILED
BUT LET THAT PASS
LAKE STARED AT THE FRIGHTENED GIRL IN HIS FIERCE ABSTRACTION
YES REVERSION I AM SURE IS THE NAME
BUT THERE WAS NONE THAT WOULD QUITE FIT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES
LARKIN HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN ACTING
IT IS NEARLY ACCOMPLISHED NOW
IN THIS LIVID HAND RISING FROM THE EARTH THERE WAS A CHARACTER BOTH OF MENACE AND APPEAL
OF COURSE THERE WAS ABUNDANCE OF TALK
SHE HATES BRACTON LIKE POISON BECAUSE HE LIKES THE BRANDON PEOPLE
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME DAMNABLE TAINT IN THE BLOOD OF THE COMMON ANCESTOR--A SPICE OF THE INSANE AND THE DIABOLICAL
IS CUM PRIVET AND HIM AND MASTER MET TONITE NERE 2 IN MORNING IN THE LONG POND ALLEE SO IS NEAR HOME THEN WE SUPOSED NO MORE AT PRESENT SIR FROM YOUR HUMBEL SERVENT JOHN LARCOM
SIR HARRY'S INVASION WAS THE MOST AUDACIOUS THING ON RECORD
BUT I THINK HE MENTIONED LARKINS'S HOUSE DIDN'T HE
LITTLE MARGERY MUST NOT SUSPECT--YOU'LL MANAGE THAT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY STANDING AND THE YOUNG LADY WITH A LAUGH SAT DOWN LOOKING SO PLEASED AND GOOD-NATURED AND MERRY THAT EVEN OLD TAMAR WAS FAIN TO SMILE A GLIMMERING SMILE
ONCE OR TWICE A NOD A LITTLE TOO DEEP OR SUDDEN CALLED ME UP
WITH MARK WYLDER IT WAS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION--ALTOGETHER VISIONARY AND IMPRACTICABLE
YES TO BOTH QUESTIONS ANSWERED SHE WITH THE FAINTEST GLEAM OF THE CONVENTIONAL SMILE AND LOOKING NOW GRAVELY AGAIN AT HER BOUQUET
I AM GOING INTO THE TOWN DOLLY AND SO ARE YOU SAID RACHEL AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
THE CONTEMPLATED UNION BETWEEN CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE LATE OF THE GUARDS SOLE SURVIVING SON OF THE LATE GENERAL WILLIAMS STANLEY STANLEY LAKE OF PLASRHWYN AND THE BEAUTIFUL AND ACCOMPLISHED MISS BRANDON OF BRANDON HALL IN THIS COUNTY WAS CELEBRATED IN THE ANCESTRAL CHAPEL OF BRANDON SITUATED WITHIN THE MANORIAL BOUNDARIES IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE TOWN OF GYLINGDEN ON YESTERDAY
ON FRIDAY NIGHT NEXT AT HALF-PAST TWELVE THIS HE READ TWICE OR THRICE PAUSING BETWEEN WHILES
PRAY UNDERSTAND THAT IN ANY WAY YOU PLEASE TO EMPLOY ME I AM ENTIRELY AT YOUR COMMAND
I LIKED YOU ALWAYS RACHEL FROM THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW YOU--I LIKED YOU BETTER AND BETTER--INDESCRIBABLY--INDEED I DO
THE YOUNG CAPTAIN STOOD FOR A MOMENT STILL ON REACHING THE UPPER PLATFORM
I THINK THAT STANLEY WAS RIGHT AND THAT LIVING IN THAT SOLITARY AND DARKSOME DELL HELPED TO MAKE HER HYPOCHONDRIAC
HAD HE SEEN IT THERE AT ALL
AND BE YOUR PLANS WHAT THEY MAY YOU SHA'N'T MIX MY NAME IN THEM
TWENTY YEARS OF HAPPY AND LOVING LIFE WERE ALLOTTED THEM AND ONE PLEDGE--POOR MISS DOROTHY--WAS LEFT ALONE WHEN LITTLE MORE THAN NINETEEN YEARS OLD
I AM--I THINK I AM--A LITTLE NERVOUS DARLING AND YOU WON'T LEAVE ME SO THEY SAT DOWN TOGETHER IN HER CHAMBER
WELL LARKIN--LETTERS LETTERS PERPETUALLY YOU SEE
CHAPTER L
AND OTHER DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY HE WAS WALKING HOMEWARDS SLOWLY AND DEJECTEDLY
HERE'S THIS LETTER--HOW MUCH TIME AND TROUBLE IT COSTS ME--HOW MUCH OPPORTUNITY POSSIBLY SACRIFICED SIMPLY BY REASON OF THE INCURABLE MENDACITY OF MEN AND HE KNOCKED THE BACK OF HIS FINGER BITTERLY ON THE OPEN PAGE
THE LITTLE COLOUR HE HAD RECEDED FROM THE VICAR'S FACE FOR THE LOOKS AND TONES OF GOOD-NATURED BUDDLE WERE NOT TO BE MISTAKEN
IF HE DOES NOT RETURN IN A DAY OR TWO CHELFORD I AM SURE WILL SPEAK TO ME AND THEN I SHALL TELL HIM MY RESOLUTION YES SAID RACHEL
IT IS THE WINDOW OF HELL AND THE SPIRITS IN PRISON COME UP TO SEE THE LIGHT OF IT
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT THEY QUARRELLED ABOUT NONE IN THE WORLD
I CAN'T TELL HOW OR WHERE TO FIND HIM
THE ATTORNEY BEING LONG AS WELL AS LANK HAD TO STOOP UNDER THE DOORWAY BUT DREW HIMSELF UP HANDSOMELY ON COMING OUT AND ASSUMED HIS EASY HIGH-BRED STYLE WHICH ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT AWARE OF IT WAS VERY NEARLY INSUPPORTABLE AND SMILED VERY ENGAGINGLY AND MEANT TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE WEATHER
HE FOLDED THE DEED AND REPLACED IT IN HIS POCKET WITH A PEACEFUL SMILE AND CLOSED EYES MURMURING I'M MUCH MISTAKEN IF THE GRAY MARE'S THE BETTER HORSE IN THAT STUD HE LAUGHED GENTLY THINKING OF THE CAPTAIN'S FORMIDABLE AND UNSCRUPULOUS NATURE EXHIBITIONS OF WHICH HE COULD NOT FAIL TO REMEMBER
THERE WAS A SHADE OF GUILT IN HIS TAMPERINGS WITH IT AKIN TO THE BLACK ART WHICH HE FELT WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING
BUT I CAN'T SEE ANY PROFIT IN NOW DISCUSSING AN ENGAGEMENT OF MORE THAN TWO MONTHS STANDING OR A MARRIAGE WHICH IS FIXED TO TAKE PLACE ONLY TEN DAYS HENCE
I AM MORE A STAY-AT-HOME THAN I USED TO BE
THE FAMILY ACCORDING TO THEIR CUSTOM HAD SOUGHT THEIR SLUMBERS EARLY
LARKIN WHO WAS STANDING AT THE DOORWAY IN SAD BUT GRACIOUS CONVERSE WITH THE VICAR
NO BELL YET--TIME ENOUGH--DING DONG
SO SUBDUED--AND HE WAS MORE INTERESTED BY HER PERHAPS THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
BESIDES YOU ARE THE LUCKIEST FELLOW IN CREATION
BUT IT RESTED AND CONSOLED HER IMAGINATION AND OPENED IN THE BLACKNESS OF HER SKY ONE SMALL VISTA THROUGH WHOSE SILVERY EDGE THE BLUE AND STARS OF HEAVEN WERE VISIBLE
BUT THE WYLDER COAT IN THE CENTRE WITH THE GRINNING GRIFFINS FOR SUPPORTERS AND FLAUNTING SCROLLS ALL ROUND AND THE OMINOUS WORD RESURGAM UNDERNEATH PROCLAIMED ITSELF SADLY AND VAUNTINGLY OVER THE GREAT ENTRANCE
THEREFORE I WILL SAY THIS--_SHE IS QUITE FREE FOR ME
THERE WAS A CERTAIN COURTEOUS FRANKNESS AND A FINE OLD ENGLISH SENSE OF DUTY PERCEPTIBLE IN ALL HIS SERIOUS TALK
YOU WOULD NOT LIKE FOR A STUPID CROTCHET TO RUIN POOR RADIE I FANCY I'M DOING JUST WHAT YOU BOTH BID ME SAID THE OLD WOMAN
STILL IT OFTEN NEEDS AS YOU SAY PROFESSIONAL ADVICE TO SOLVE SUCH DIFFICULTIES--IT IS VERY SAD--OH
IT SAID DEAR CHELFORD DON'T GET RILED
HOW HAD THAT HORRIBLE FIGURE COME THERE--WHY WAS THIS MEETING--WHENCE HIS KNOWLEDGE
WE TOLD HIM THAT BUDDLE HAD BEEN SENT FOR
AND TELL ME NOW HOW DO YOU GET ON WITH THE BRANDON PEOPLE RACHEL WAS CURIOUS AND WOULD IF SHE COULD HAVE RECALLED THAT SARCASTIC OH WHICH HAD POSTPONED THE STORY
LARKIN'S PRESENCE
MR DRIVER KNEW HIM MR LARKIN AND HE MIGHT TELL HIS YOUNG MEN IF THEY GOT THE LETTER FOR HIM THEY SHOULD HEAR NO MORE OF IT
HE NEVER CAN BE ANYTHING TO ME
HE WAS PLEASED TO DIRECT A POWER OF ATTORNEY TO ME TO RECEIVE HIS RENTS AND SIGN RECEIPTS
AND LADY CONSTANCE OF COURSE HAS A CLAIM ON HIS TIME AND THOUGHTS RACHEL SMILED AS SHE SPOKE AND WAS ADJUSTING HER BOUQUET AS DORCAS MADE ANSWER LADY CONSTANCE MY DEAR RADIE
AND YOU MUST COME WITH ME
THIS WAY WAS RATHER A ROUND IT MUST BE CONFESSED TO THE LODGE--JOS LARKIN'S PEACEFUL RETREAT
THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND ARE UPON THE WHOLE HAPPIER AND MORE CHEERFUL THAN THEY ARE ALWAYS WILLING TO ALLOW
I OFTEN THOUGHT I MUST GO MAD IN MY SOLITUDE POOR RACHEL
IF HE TRIES AND FAILS I SUPPOSE HE WILL BE RUINED
I HAVE GOT EXACTLY 55_L SINCE I SAW YOU WHICH MAKES ME ALL RIGHT AT DOLLINGTON
THE CHAPEL LAY FULL IN VIEW WHERE SO MANY OF THE STRANGE AND EQUIVOCAL RACE UNDER WHOSE ANCIENT ROOF-TREE I THEN STOOD WERE LYING UNDER THEIR TOMBSTONES
AND IF HE HAD HAD HIS WAY I THINK THE WORLD WOULD HAVE GONE SMOOTHLY ENOUGH WITH MOST PEOPLE
SHE WAS FLUSHED AND FELT ODDLY
LAWYER LARKIN'S MIND WAS WORKING MORE DILIGENTLY THAN ANYONE SUSPECTED UPON THIS PUZZLE OF MARK WYLDER
AND AT LAST A VERY KINDLY PARTING AND A PROMISE FROM THE SIMPLE AND GENTLE VICAR THAT HE WOULD OFTEN LOOK IN AT REDMAN'S FARM
LARKIN ESQ MENTIONING THAT HE HAD FOUND MESSRS
WELL I HAVEN'T CRIED THE DOCTOR WITH AN AGREEABLE CHUCKLE SHAKING THE MAJOR'S HAND AND DISAPPEARING AGAIN INTO HIS PARLOUR
I COULD NOT SEE HIM TO-DAY
THERE ARE THE DODMINSTERS
THERE WAS THE FIVE OAKS ESTATE SPECIALLY EXCLUDED FROM SETTLEMENT WORTH 1,400_L A YEAR
NOW OLD LADY CHELFORD CHOSE TO PATRONISE MR PAGE THE DOLLINGTON PROFESSOR AND PARTLY I FANCY TO SHOW THAT SHE COULD TURN THINGS TOPSY-TURVY IN THIS TOWN OF GYLINGDEN HAD MADE A POINT WITH THE RULERS OF THE FEAST THAT HER CLIENT SHOULD SING HALF-A-DOZEN SONGS IN THE SUPPER-ROOM BEFORE DANCING COMMENCED
THEY'LL NEVER BRING ME THERE BY HORSE UNDER TWO HOURS THEY ARE SO CURSED TEDIOUS
MR LARCOM PREPARED TO BE FAST ASLEEP IN THE CHAIR IN THE EVENT OF THE CAPTAIN'S MAKING A SUDDEN ADVANCE AND ENTERING HIS SANCTUM
I ONLY KNOW HE MAKES ME OFTEN VERY UNCOMFORTABLE ANSWERED RACHEL
I HAVE NOT AN IDEA
RACHEL LAKE WAS INDEED A VERY CONSTANT GUEST AT THE HALL AND THE SERVANTS PAID HER MUCH RESPECT WHICH I LOOK UPON AS A SIGN THAT THE YOUNG HEIRESS LIKED HER AND TREATED HER WITH CONSIDERATION
AND A DEED TO BE EXECUTED AT SHILLINGSWORTH WHICH HE WOULD TAKE EN ROUTE FOR GYLINGDEN STOPPING THERE FOR THAT NIGHT AND GOING ON BY NEXT MORNING'S TRAIN
MY DEAR FATHER THE ORGANIST WOULD NOT SEND A BOY OF HIS TO WHAT HE CALLED AN IDLE SCHOOL
I ASSURE YOU MY LORD THAT IS THE IDENTICAL PHRASE HE EMPLOYS--SELF-PRESERVATION
CAN YOU CONJECTURE WHERE HIS ADDRESS MAY NOW BE ASKED THE VICAR A LITTLE ABRUPTLY
HIS TROUBLES WERE HEAVY UPON HIM TOO JUST THEN
IS NOT IT SAD PRAY DON'T LET IT AFFECT YOUR SPIRITS SAID LAKE WHO WAS LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKING ON THE CARPET ABOUT A YARD BEFORE HIS LACQUERED BOOTS IN HIS USUAL SLY WAY
SO I HAD NOT PATIENCE YOU SEE IT WAS NOW RACHEL'S TURN TO LAUGH A MUSICAL LITTLE ROULADE
SO THE BEAUTY OF OUR FAMILY NEVER AVAILED IT ANY MORE THAN ITS TALENTS AND ITS COURAGE
AND YOU KNOW THE BEGGAR HAS NEXT TO NOTHING
OH SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A GENTLE SORT OF DERISION
HE DID NOT SEE THAT LUCK AND SELFISHNESS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT
BUT HE INSTANTLY RECOVERED HIMSELF
VERY WELL DARLING LISTEN CHAPTER LXII
HE DREW NEAR HIS WINDOW
HIS RUMINATIONS WERE DREARY I FANCY AND HIS TEMPER BY NO MEANS PLEASANT
IT'S MY CHARACTER THE TWO GENTLEMEN YOU PERCEIVE THOUGH STILL AGITATED WERE BECOMING REASONABLE AND MORE OR LESS COMPLIMENTARY AND CONCILIATORY
TO TRY TO ANSWER THE SMILES OF THOSE WHO AT LEAST ONCE LOVED ME AND TO TAKE THEIR HANDS
COULD HE TELL
PERHAPS HE THOUGHT HE SAW A PHANTOM
I DROVE HIM TO DOLLINGTON LAST NIGHT
YOU'VE SEEN HIM LARCOM
I'LL HEAR IT THEN
WHEN HE READS WHAT I SEND HIM BY YOUR HAND HE'LL BE AS MILD AS YOU PLEASE
THE WHIST PARTY WERE OLD JERMYN CARTER VANBRUGH AND WYLDER
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE LISTEN TO REASON
AND THE PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT WE HAVE NAMED AND MINOR HOUSES OF REFECTION WERE VOCAL WITH THE TALK OF FLUNKEYS PATRICIAN WITH POWDERED HEADS AND SPLENDENT IN VARIEGATED LIVERIES
OLD TAMAR WOULD NOT LEAVE HER BUT KEPT HER SEAT IN THE HIGH-BACKED ARM-CHAIR THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT LIKE A NURSE--AS INDEED SHE WAS--IN A SICK CHAMBER
MAY I TAKE THE LIBERTY TO ASK YOU FOR ONE MOMENT TO LOOK UP AS BETWEEN THESE TWO GENTLEMEN THIS IT MUST BE ALLOWED WAS AN IMPERTINENT REQUEST
AND I THINK MY QUESTIONS VERY MUCH TO THE PURPOSE SAID THE YOUNG LADY IN HER LOW SILVERY TONES
IDLE SPECULATION
AND WITHOUT FULL CONSIDERATION WITHOUT URGENT CAUSE I STANLEY WILL NOT BEGIN WHY IT IS ONLY FIVE OAKS AND WE SHALL HAVE THE MONEY YOU FORGET SAID STANLEY
I WAS BETRAYED I DON'T KNOW HOW INTO THIS LITTLE VENTURE AND IT WAS A FLAT FAILURE
BUT MEN ARE SO DIFFERENT SO AUDACIOUS--SOME MEN AT LEAST--AND STANLEY EVER SINCE HIS ILL-OMENED ARRIVAL AT REDMAN'S FARM LAST AUTUMN HAS AMAZED AND TERRIFIED ME I THINK RADIE WE HAVE BOTH COURAGE--_YOU HAVE CERTAINLY
I ALL ALONG SUSPECTED OR RATHER I MEAN SUPPOSED THAT MR WYLDER HAD BEEN PLACED IN THIS MATTER UNDER COERCION--A--A THREAT A LITTLE MORE WINE ASKED LORD CHELFORD AFTER ANOTHER INTERVAL
SHE WAS ALWAYS VERY KIND TO YOU STANLEY AND JUST THEN OLD TAMAR OPENED THE DOOR
DO YOU KNOW HIM SIR JULIUS HOCKLEY
COME NOW--WILL YOU?--AND SEE THEM AND SHE PLACED RACHEL'S HAND ON HER ARM AND THE TWO YOUNG LADIES DEPARTED
IT'S SO AWFUL SECRET SHE SAID WITH HER HAND STILL UPON HIS ARM
THE STRANGE BITTERNESS OF HER TONE THOUGH IT WAS LOW ENOUGH AND SOMETHING WILD SUFFERING AND REVENGEFUL IN HER LOOK THOUGH BUT MOMENTARY AND HARDLY DEFINABLE DID NOT ESCAPE LORD CHELFORD AND HE FOLLOWED UNCONSCIOUSLY THE DIRECTION OF HER GLANCE
7_D
OH RACHEL IT IS A GREAT BLOW--MAYBE IF YOU THOUGHT IT OVER!--I'LL WAIT ANY TIME NO LORD CHELFORD I'M QUITE UNWORTHY OF YOUR PREFERENCE
I'M YOUR WIFE WELL DORCAS I TOLD YOU SOMETHING OF IT
I THINK I CAN RISK A CONJECTURE
LORD CHELFORD I CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW GRATEFUL I AM AND HOW ASTONISHED BUT IT COULD NEVER BE--NO--NEVER RACHEL PERHAPS YOU MEAN MY MOTHER--I HAVE TOLD HER EVERYTHING--SHE WILL RECEIVE YOU WITH ALL THE RESPECT YOU SO WELL DESERVE
I HOPE SO AT LEAST FOR THAT WOULD FORCE YOU TO APPEAR AMONG US SOMETIMES NO I AM NOT LONELY--THAT IS NOT LONELIER THAN IS GOOD FOR ME
BUT BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO TAKE THIS STEP AN OCCURRENCE TOOK PLACE TO ARREST HIS PROCEEDINGS
I'LL RETURN ON SATURDAY
I AWOKE JUST THEN IT IS ODD SAID MISS LAKE WITH A LITTLE LAUGH
INTO WHAT THEY CALL A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE--I FORGET THE FRENCH WORD--YOU KNOW
IT WAS A DISTINCTION
IN FACT IT WAS BY THIS TIME HALF-PAST ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND WORKING-PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY SIT UP TO THAT HOUR
DORCAS PALE AS MARBLE SIGHING DEEPLY AGAIN AND AGAIN HER RICH BLACK HAIR DRENCHED IN WATER WHICH TRICKLED OVER HER CHEEKS LIKE THE TEARS AND MOISTURE OF AGONY WAS RECOVERING
AND THERE IS NO EXTREMITY I WILL NOT MAKE YOU FEEL--AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN--IF YOU DARE DESPISE THIS FIRST AND NOT UNFRIENDLY WARNING
I DON'T THINK HIS FRIENDS WOULD ADVISE IT AND WHY NOT
AND IT IS TOO BAD TO HAVE ONE'S TIME WASTED IN SOLEMN LECTURES ABOUT STUFF AND NONSENSE
LOVERS MAYBE AND HOW
HAVE YOU HEARD LATELY FROM JIM NO YOU'LL SEE HIM SOON HOWEVER AND GIVE HIM THIS NOTE D'YE SEE AND TELL HIM I WAS HERE ASKING ABOUT YOU AND HIM AND VERY WELL AND GLAD IF I CAN SERVE HIM AGAIN
PRECISELY THE SAME HOWEVER WAS TO BE SAID OF HIS CONNECTION WITH MARK WYLDER
I AM NOT SURE THAT MR LARKIN'S HAND DID NOT SHAKE A LITTLE AS HE TOOK THE STATEMENT OF TITLE AGAIN OUT OF THE WYLDER TIN BOX NO
LITTLE MRS ESTERBROKE THE HOUSEKEEPER WAS FUSSING HITHER AND THITHER ABOUT THE ROOM NOISELESSLY
SEVERAL OF OUR NEIGHBOURS--THE HILLYARDS THE LEDWICHES THE WYNDERMERES AND EVER SO MANY MORE--HAVE SPOKEN TO ME VERY STRONGLY ABOUT CONTESTING THE COUNTY ON THE OLD WHIG PRINCIPLES AT THE ELECTION WHICH IS NOW IMMINENT
AND HOLD YOUR TONGUE DO YOU SEE OH MASTER STANLEY MASTER STANLEY
IT IS BECAUSE YOU LIVE SO SOLITARY HERE AND IT IS SUCH A GLOOMY OUT-O'-THE-WAY SPOT--SO AWFULLY DARK AND DAMP NOBODY COULD BE WELL HERE AND YOU REALLY MUST CHANGE
THIS IS DATED THE 29TH SAID LAKE IN THE SAME QUIET TONE
BUT WHATEVER THE IMPULSE IT SUBSIDED--OR WAS DIVERTED BY SOME NEW IDEA
AND WHEN HIS SHIP CAME TO ENGLAND MET FREQUENTLY
FOR THOUGH THIS WAS A VERY RESPECTABLE-LOOKING FELLOW FOR HIS WALK IN LIFE THE GAY YOUNG OFFICER STARED FULL AT HIM WITH A FRIGHTENED AND RATHER DREADFUL COUNTENANCE AND ACTUALLY SPRUNG FROM HIS BED AT THE OTHER SIDE WITH AN EJACULATION AT ONCE TRAGIC AND BLASPHEMOUS
ONCE OR TWICE I FANCIED SOMETHING AND STARTED UP IN MY BED
BUT THIS MOVEMENT WAS NOT EXECUTED
BUT REALLY THE SUN SETS CRUELLY EARLY THIS EVENING AND I AM SO VERY SORRY OUR LITTLE WALK IS SO SOON TO END THERE WAS NOT MUCH IN THIS LITTLE SPEECH BUT IT WAS SPOKEN IN A LOW SWEET VOICE
AND THE VULGAR BRUTE WILL BE AS RICH AS CROESUS I DARE SAY HERE SOLILOQUISED STANLEY LAKE IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S ORDINARY VEIN
WHEN HOWEVER FORTUNE SO PLACED THEM THAT ONE OR OTHER MUST GO TO THE WALL CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE WAS AWFULLY UNSCRUPULOUS
YOU KNOW DEAR BEFORE HE WENT MARK PROMISED TO LEND DEAR WILLIE A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
AND THEN HE MOUNTED A CHAIR AND TOOK DOWN SUCCESSIVELY FOUR OF HIS JAPANNED BOXES
BUT PERHAPS TO-MORROW--PERHAPS EVEN TO-DAY--YOU MAY RELENT YOU KNOW
WHAT A CHARMING PARK
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY OLD PLAN OF THE VALLEYS AND LAKES OF WALES
YOU KNOW HOW IT ALL CAME ABOUT AND YOU MUST SEE I'M NOT REALLY TO BLAME AT LEAST IN INTENTION FOR ALL THIS MISERABLE TROUBLE
NEITHER HAD OLD LADY CHELFORD ALTHOUGH SHE HARANGUED HER SON UPON IT AS VOLUBLY AND FIERCELY AS IF HE HAD BEEN MARK WYLDER IN PERSON WHENEVER HE AND SHE WERE TETE-A-TETE
SHE HAD BEGUN TO THINK AND NOT WITHOUT EVIDENCE THAT DORCAS FOR SOME CAUSE OR CAPRICE HAD CEASED TO THINK OF STANLEY AS SHE ONCE DID
BUT HER WARNINGS AND ENTREATIES I HAVE SAID WERE NOT QUITE THROWN AWAY
IT'S CRUEL--IT'S COWARDLY I MEAN TO DO IT--YOU'LL SEE SUDDENLY SHE HURRIED BY HIM AND IN A MOMENT WAS IN THE LITTLE KITCHEN WITH ITS FIRE AND CANDLE BURNING CHEERILY
IT BEING TIME ENOUGH WHEN I GO BACK AND NO SQUALLS A-HEAD JUST NOW AT HOME THOUGH FOREIGN POLITICS LOOK MUGGY ENOUGH
HE WAS THINKING HOW ARISTOCRATIC HE LOOKED AND HOW WELL IN EXTERNALS HE BECAME THE BRANDON SEAT
PRODUCED BY STAN GOODMAN THOMAS BERGER AND THE ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM
D THE DOGS WHAT ARE THEY BARKING FOR SAID LAKE FAINTLY
SOME MOST POWERFUL AND MYSTERIOUS CAUSE MUST UNDOUBTEDLY BE IN OPERATION TO INDUCE SO SHARP A PARTY SO KEEN AFTER THIS WORLD'S WEALTH TO RISK SO HUGE A PRIZE
AND ANOTHER TIME WHEN HE LENT HIM HIS COPY OF BELL'S LIFE IN THE COFFEE-ROOM
HE LOITERED AT THE TABLE
AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO GIVE THEM THE HANDLING OF MINE
IN THE DUTCH ROOM WHERE THEY WAITED THERE WAS A LARGE TABLE WITH A PYRAMID OF BLANK ENVELOPES IN THE MIDDLE AND EVER SO MANY CUBIC FEET OF CANVASSING CIRCULARS SIX CHAIRS AND PENS AND INK
YES DEAR DORCAS AND SHE KISSED THE SLENDER HAND THAT SMOOTHED HER HAIR
THIS IS NO PLACE YOU KNOW TAMAR TO TALK IN
BURLINGTON AND SMITH AS A BARGAIN IRREVOCABLY CONCLUDED IN POINT OF HONOUR AND MORALITY
BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN MEN ARE TRANSLATED FROM THEIR NATURES AND FORCED TO BE ROMANTIC AND SUPERSTITIOUS
AH THANK YOU
I WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO HEAR A STEP STIRRING OR A COUGH EVEN OR THE GABBLE OF SERVANTS AT A DISTANCE
YOU WON'T MIND A WORD I SAY AND GO ON PREDICTING ALL MANNER OF MISCHIEF BETWEEN ME AND WYLDER THE VERY NATURE OF WHICH I CAN'T SURMISE
AND SHE TOOK HIS LITTLE HAND IN HERS--IT WAS HOT AND DRY
YOU SHALL HAVE NO MORE TROUBLE I ASSURE YOU
BUT HAVE WE NO COMPENSATION IN THIS THAT THE LOVE WHICH BEGETS IT IS OFTEN AS UNREASONABLE
THE QUESTION CERTAINLY DOES ARISE
BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS VERY FAR FROM FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN HE LET HIMSELF INTO HIS FAMILY HOTEL WITH THAT LATCHKEY THE COCK'S TAIL OF MICYLLUS WITH WHICH GOOD-NATURED OLD MRS MUGGERIDGE OBLIGED THE GOOD-LOOKING CAPTAIN
DOES LITTLE DORKIE LOVE ME SAID LAKE IN A SWEET UNDERTONE
IT WON'T DO SIR SAID LARKIN WITH A SINISTER QUIETUDE
BUT SHE WAS ALSO A LITTLE ANGRY AND WITH ANGER THERE WAS PRIDE WHICH WOULD NOT STOOP TO ASK FOR THE REVELATION WHICH HE CHOSE TO DEFER
HERE THE CAPTAIN WAS PERCEPTIBLY STEALING INTO HIS OLD WAYS AND FEELINGS
I HEARD IT--I COULD NOT HELP HEARING
AS FOR MARK IT WAS PRESUMED HE HAD GONE INTO VOLUNTARY BANISHMENT AND WAS MAKING THE GRAND TOUR IN THE SPIRIT OF THAT LACKADAISICAL GENTLEMAN IN THE THEN FASHIONABLE SONG WHO SAYS FROM SPORT TO SPORT THEY HURRY ME TO BANISH MY REGRET AND IF THEY WIN A SMILE FROM ME THEY THINK THAT I FORGET
THEY WERE NOW APPROACHING SHILLINGSWORTH WHERE THE ATTORNEY WAS TO GET OUT AND PUT UP FOR THE NIGHT HAVING A DEED WITH HIM TO BE EXECUTED IN THAT TOWN AND SO SWEETENING HIS JOURNEY WITH THIS SMALL INCIDENT OF PROFIT
FLAG-STAFFS FOR INSTANCE AND BANNERS MARQUEES PYROTECHNIC MACHINERY AND LONG TIERS OF ROCKETS FESTOONS OF EVERGREENS TRIUMPHAL ARCHES WITH APPROPRIATE MOTTOES TO COME DOWN AND HIDE THEMSELVES AWAY WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASANT TO THE MANY WHO LIKE A JOKE AND TO THE FEW LET US HOPE WHO LOVE A SNEER
THE WELL--I CAN'T COMPREHEND--HOW IN THE NAME OF--HOW IN THE NAME HE PLACED THE TWO LETTERS ON HIS DESK AND READ THEM OVER AND UP AND DOWN AND PONDERED DARKLY OVER THEM
I DON'T THINK THE CAPTAIN WOULD VENTURE ANYTHING SO AWFULLY HAZARDOUS
THERE WAS NO GUEST JUST THEN AT BRANDON AND THE CAPTAIN SAT ALONE ON THAT DEVOTIONAL DAIS THE ELEVATED FLOOR OF THE GREAT OAKEN BRANDON SEAT
WHEN LUST HATH CONCEIVED IT BRINGETH FORTH SIN AND SIN WHEN IT IS FINISHED BRINGETH FORTH DEATH
IT ACTUALLY THREATENED THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH WAS SO NEAR ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT
HE SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM WEEPING GENTLY HIS THIN FACE TURNED A LITTLE AWAY AND HIS HAND ON THE COVERLET
SHE GOT THEM CRYING FITS UP STAIRS YOU KNOW
EVERYONE KNOWS SOMETHING OF THE ENCHANTMENT OF THE ITALIAN MOON THE EXPANSE OF DARK AND FLASHING BLUE AND THE PHANTASMAL CITY RISING LIKE A BEAUTIFUL SPIRIT FROM THE WATERS
CAPTAIN LAKE FOLLOWS TO LONDON
SHE LISTENS I DARE SAY THE LITTLE SPY SAID HE
AND KEEP THIS LETTER AS CLOSE FROM EVERY EYE AS SEALED ORDERS
YOU D--D OLD MISCREANT
AND THEN A SORT OF START
AND INDEED UNLESS YOU PROCEED TO SIGN I HAD BETTER GO AS MY TIME IS GENERALLY I MAY SAY A LITTLE PRESSED UPON AND I HAVE IN FACT SOME BUSINESS ELSEWHERE TO ATTEND TO WHAT IS THIS LAW-PAPER DEMANDED RACHEL LAYING THE TIPS OF HER SLENDER FINGERS UPON IT
AND WAS NOW BEGINNING TO FEEL ALARM LEST THE PURCHASE OF THE REVERSION SHOULD FAIL
THERE WAS A LITTLE FAIR-HAIRED CHILD PLAYING ON THE GROUND BEFORE THE STEPS AS I WHIRLED BY
HE FORGOT HOW DARK IT WAS
MAY WE GO INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM
WHEN I CAME INTO THE PARLOUR THIS MORNING I KNEW THEY WERE SPEAKING OF IT
RACHEL SAW THAT SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG AND BECKONED HIM TOWARD THE PORCH IN SILENCE AND HAVING REMOVED THE SLENDER FASTENINGS OF THE DOOR IT OPENED AND HE ENTERED IN A RUSH OF DAMP NIGHT AIR
NO NOTHING OF THAT KIND
YOU DON'T WANT MY ADVICE BUT REALLY I DO RADIE
WHY ONE PLACE IS AS WELL AS ANOTHER
LARKIN HESITATES TO STRIKE BUT THAT WON'T LAST LONG
I'M JUST WHAT THE PRAYER-BOOK SAYS--NEITHER MORE NOR LESS--A MISERABLE SINNER
AND MORE DARKLY ABOUT HIS RELATIONS WITH MARK WYLDER--_PRINCEPS INDUETUR MAERORE
HER INTERVIEW WITH DORCAS REMAINED ON HER MEMORY LIKE AN ODD CLEAR HALF-HORRIBLE DREAM
I WAS RIDICULOUSLY ANNOYED WITH MYSELF
LARKIN STARED AT HIM WITH HIS WORST EXPRESSION
HE WAS NOT GLAD
PUT HER HEAD DOWN
THAT IN ANOTHER MAN WOULD HAVE INDICATED SOMETHING
VASTLY FINE AND INDEPENDENT
SO IN DUE TIME IN CAME THE CORPULENT PROPRIETOR AND LAWYER LARKIN SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND BEGGED HIM TO SIT DOWN LIKE A MAN WHO CONFERS A DISTINCTION
AND HE LOOKED AT THEM ALL WONDERINGLY FOR TWO OR THREE MOMENTS AND SO TIRED
THE FACT IS I SUPPOSE HE WAS CONFOUNDEDLY NERVOUS DYSPEPTIC OR WHATEVER ELSE IT MIGHT BE AND THE HEAT AND GLARE WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIM
MAY I DEPEND UPON YOU YES MA'AM CERTAINLY IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK
I WROTE TO MY FAIR FRIEND MISS KYBES AND HAD AN ANSWER CONFIRMING IF THAT WERE NEEDED THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT AND MENTIONING ENIGMATICALLY THAT IT HAD CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF CONVERSATION THE POSTURE OF AFFAIRS IN THE SMALL WORLD OF GYLINGDEN EXCEPT IN THE MATTER OF THE ALLIANCE JUST REFERRED TO WAS NOT MUCH CHANGED
FOR HE APPROACHED HIS FACE VERY NEAR TO IT IN A SCRUTINISING WAY AND ONLY SAID OH THAT MARRYING FOR LOVE WAS A FATALITY IN OUR FAMILY SHE CONTINUED IN THE SAME LOW TONE--TOO FAINT I THINK TO REACH MARK
I THINK I HAVE A RIGHT TO YOUR ADVICE DORKIE WHY DON'T YOU ASK RACHEL SHE'S CLEVERER THAN I AND YOU ARE MORE IN THE HABIT OF CONSULTING HER NOW DORKIE IS GOING TO TALK HER WICKED NONSENSE OVER AGAIN AS IF I HAD NEVER ANSWERED IT
WELL YOU KNOW BEST
YOU ARE TAKING I'VE TOLD YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN THE VERY WAY TO EXCITE ATTENTION AND GOSSIP
AND SEE RACHEL THERE'S NO USE IN LECTURING ME_--SO DON'T LET US QUARREL
BUT BE I WHAT I MAY MY OBJECTIONS ARE INSURMOUNTABLE
CHAPTER XLIX
YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF QUITE NERVOUS
ARE YOU ILL DORKIE DARLING SAID THE APPARITION IN ACCENTS OF TENDERNESS
SHE LIVED ON BAD TEA--SAT UP ALL NIGHT--AND EVERY NOW AND THEN BURST INTO HELPLESS FLOODS OF TEARS
FOR IF IT BE IT IS THE ACT OF A MADMAN AND I'LL PREVENT IT IF I POSSIBLY CAN UPON MY WORD
AH
STANLEY LAKE WHO HAD BEGUN TO ENTERTAIN HOPES FOR RACHEL IN THAT DIRECTION WENT DOWN TO REDMAN'S FARM AND AFTER HIS BLEAK AND BITTER FASHION RATED THE YOUNG LADY FOR HAVING PERVERSELY NEGLECTED HER OPPORTUNITIES AND REPULSED THAT MOST DESIRABLE PARTI
YOU'LL MAKE A FUSS
LARKIN IN LAVENDER TROUSERS AND KID GLOVES NEW HAT METROPOLITAN BLACK FROCK-COAT AND SHINING FRENCH BOOTS--THE MOST ELEGANT AS WELL AS THE MOST CHRISTIAN OF PROVINCIAL ATTORNEYS
ALTOGETHER CURIOSITY IF NO DEEPER SENTIMENT WAS HIGHLY PIQUED
THE SILVER LION DID A GREAT BUSINESS THAT NIGHT
AND SHE SEATED HERSELF AND CONTINUED PRAY WHAT DOES THE DOCTOR REALLY SAY HE SPEAKS VERY SERIOUSLY DOES HE THINK THERE IS DANGER VERY GREAT DANGER MISS BRANDON LOOKED DOWN AND THEN WITH A PALE GAZE SUDDENLY IN CHELFORD'S FACE HE THINKS HE MAY DIE SAID SHE
AS THERE WERE NO MORE GATES TO OPEN MISS BRANDON DISMISSED THE SERVANT WHO STOOD AT THE PONIES HEADS AND WHO TOUCHING HIS HAT WITH HIS WHITE GLOVE RECEIVED HIS CONGE AND STRODE WITH WILLING STEPS UP THE ROAD
AND AT HIS REQUEST AND WITH LORD CHELFORD'S APPROVAL HAVE BEEN ADVISED WITH IN DETAIL UPON ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS CONNECTED WITH THE APPROACHING MARRIAGE I AM NOT GOING AT PRESENT TO SAY ANY MORE UPON THESE SUBJECTS BECAUSE LADY CHELFORD PREFERS DEFERRING OUR CONVERSATION SAID THIS VERY ODD YOUNG LADY
TOM WEALDON WOULD HIMSELF IN PASSING GIVE THE MEN AT THE COAL-WORKS A HINT
SO SHE THOUGHT IT BETTER I SHOULD COME FOR ORDERS TO YOUR LORDSHIP
THE OPINION CAME--VERY CLEAR VERY QUIET VERY UNPLEASANT--DEAD AGAINST MR LARKIN'S VIEW AND CONCLUDING WITH THE REMARK THAT HE THOUGHT THERE WAS MORE IN THE AFFAIR THAN HAD YET COME TO LIGHT
SO THE LAWYER HAVING TO RUN ON AS FAR AS CHARTERIS BY THE GOODS-TRAIN UPON BUSINESS WALKED DOWN TO THE STATION WHERE HAVING HALF-AN-HOUR TO WAIT HE FELL INTO TALK WITH THE STATION-MASTER WHOM HE ALSO KNEW AND AFTERWARDS WITH TOM CHRISTMAS THE PORTER
AND SO DORCAS AS SWAINS ARE SELDOM PASSIONATELY IN LOVE WITH SO SMALL A PITTANCE AS MINE I THINK I SHALL MATURE INTO A QUEER OLD MAID AND TAKE ALL THE LITTLE WYLDERS MASTERS AND MISSES WITH YOUR LEAVE FOR THEIR WALKS AND HELP TO MAKE THEIR PINAFORES WHEREUPON MISS DORCAS PUT HER PONIES INTO A VERY QUICK TROT AND BECAME ABSORBED IN HER DRIVING
MR LARKIN EYED HER FOR A SECOND TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER SHE WAS TELLING LIES
YOU REMEMBER MY POOR MAMMA DON'T YOU VERY WELL THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD YET SHOWN ANY TENDENCY SO FAR AS I HAD SEEN TO BE INTERESTED IN ANYTHING OR TO TALK TO ME
IT IS WORTH TRYING
IMPERFECTLY AS IT WAS SEEN HE COULD UNDERSTAND IT
BUT I WISH TO SAY THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR MATTER I BEG IT MAY BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THAT MR WYLDER IS IN NO RESPECT MORE MY CLIENT THAN YOU CAPTAIN LAKE AND THAT I MERELY ACT AS A MOST RELUCTANT MESSENGER IN THE MATTER JUST SO SAID CAPTAIN LAKE
BUT THERE IS A PLEASANT SHARPNESS IN ENGLISH EVENINGS QUITE PECULIAR
HE ASKED BUDDLE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK HAVING WAKED UP FROM A SORT OF STUPOR)--'WHAT ABOUT JIM DUTTON AND THEN WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TALK ABOUT A BODY THEY HAD FOUND AND WHAT IT WAS
I CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE BRANDON SHERRY MR LARCOM
QUITE TO OURSELVES YOU AND I
BUT IN WYLDER'S I SAW A SORT OF CONCEITED CONSCIOUSNESS AND A CERTAIN EAGERNESS TOO WHILE HE TALKED
EVERY MAN MUST TASTE OF DEATH
A LITTLE STUNNED AND STRANGE ALTHOUGH SHE HAD TALKED LIGHTLY AND EASILY ENOUGH
IN WHICH OLD TAMAR LIFTS UP HER VOICE IN PROPHECY
A NOTE SIR OH YES
AND THEY ARE TO PLAY AT HOCKLEY SIR JULIUS HOCKLEY'S GROUND
YOU'RE NOT EQUAL TO IT EITHER I THINK AND LAKE LEANED ON THE PALING
THE HYAENA CERTAINLY WAS NOT SHOWING FIGHT
I ASSURE YOU I DOUBT VERY MUCH IF THE DEEDS ARE SAFE IN HIS POSSESSION
AND INDEED THERE WAS AN INDESCRIBABLE AIR OF SUBSERVIENCE IN THE DEMEANOUR OF THE SQUARE-BUILT GENTLEMAN VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT MARK WYLDER ONCE SHOWED
AND WHAT IS SMITH DOING OR SAYING WHY HE HAS BEEN TALKING OVER ELECTION MATTERS
THE VICAR HAD THEORIES ABOUT IMAGINATION AND FANCIED IT WAS AN IMPORTANT FACULTY AND THAT THE CREATOR HAD NOT GIVEN CHILDREN THEIR UNEXTINGUISHABLE LOVE OF STORIES TO NO PURPOSE
IT WAS ESCAPE--FLIGHT FROM GYLINGDEN--FLIGHT FROM BRANDON--FLIGHT FROM REDMAN'S FARM
AND INDEED ONLY THAT THE TRADESPEOPLE HERE ARE SO VERY KIND WE SHOULD OFTEN FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE PERHAPS SAID MR LARKIN BLANDLY YOU WOULD PERMIT ME TO LOOK AT THE LETTER YOU MENTION HAVING RECEIVED FROM THE SOLICITORS AT CAMBRIDGE OH THANK YOU CERTAINLY
THERE'S A GOOD GIRL
AND I'VE GROWN TO LIKE YOU SO THAT IF I LOSE YOU I THINK I SHALL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY LITTLE PAUSE THE BLUSH WAS DEEPER HER EYES LOWER STILL
THE BEST MAN THE SIMPLEST MAN THAT EVER LIVED HAS HIS RESERVES
AND A NOTE IN THE GOOD ATTORNEY'S HAND INVITING HIM TO REMAIN AT THE LODGE TILL HIS RETURN AND PARTICULARLY REQUESTING THAT HE WOULD KINDLY ABSTAIN FROM MENTIONING TO ANYONE DURING HIS ABSENCE ANY MATTER HE MIGHT INTEND TO COMMUNICATE TO HIM IN HIS PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY OR OTHERWISE THIS OF COURSE WAS A LITTLE CRITICAL AND MADE HIS TO-MORROW'S JOURNEY TO LONDON A RATHER ANXIOUS PROSPECT
I DON T LIKE HOWEVER SENDING YOU INTO THE JAWS OF THE CITY SHARKS--I USE THE TERM MY DEAR MR WYLDER ADVISEDLY--AND I MAKE A SOLITARY EXCEPTION IN YOUR CASE
HE WAS NOT ADDICTED TO STORMY GREETINGS AND PATTED HIS SISTER'S SHOULDER GENTLY HIS ARM A LITTLE EXTENDED LIKE A MAN WHO TRANQUILLISES A FROLICSOME PONY
IT SEEMED TO ME TO INDICATE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN MERE INDIFFERENCE--SOMETHING OF AVERSION AND NEARER TO A POSITIVE EMOTION THAN ANYTHING I HAD YET SEEN IN THAT EXQUISITELY APATHETIC FACE
YOU'LL SEE TO THAT MR BUGGS PLEASE
RACHEL SAID DORCAS I AM A CHANGEABLE BEING--VIOLENT SELF-WILLED
THEN YOU REALLY THINK THERE IS A CONSPIRACY--FORMED BY HIM OR AGAINST HIM WHICH AGAINST HIM CAPTAIN LAKE
AND I VENTURE TO SAY CAPTAIN LAKE THAT LORD CHELFORD WILL BE JUST AS MUCH SURPRISED AS I WHEN HE HEARS IT JOS
THERE'S CAPTAIN LAKE OF BRANDON FOR INSTANCE--I SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF I LOST THE BRANDON BUSINESS THE DAY AFTER THE MATTER REACHED HIS EARS
THEN OUR FRIEND STANLEY HAVING RUMINATED FOR A MINUTE PENCILLED A LITTLE NOTE TO MARK TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS STAYING AT MUGGERIDGE'S HOTEL 7 HANOVER STREET PICCADILLY AND WISHED MOST PARTICULARLY TO SEE HIM FOR A FEW MINUTES
12_S
BUT THIS WAS NOT A TEMPESTUOUS CONFERENCE BY ANY MEANS
BURLINGTON AND SMITH WERE TO BE DRAWN WITH AN EXACTER PENCIL AND FAR MORE DELICATE COLOURING
THERE WAS A POSTSCRIPT TO LAKE'S LETTER WHICH MIGHT HAVE OPENED MY EYES AS TO THE MOTIVES OF THIS PRESSING INVITATION WHICH I PLEASED MYSELF BY THINKING THOUGH PENNED BY CAPTAIN LAKE CAME IN REALITY FROM HIS BEAUTIFUL YOUNG BRIDE
IN SOBER EARNEST YOUR ADVICE ANSWERED LAKE
HER LIKINGS AND DISLIKINGS WERE ALWAYS MORE OR LESS ENIGMATICAL
NOT HERE TAMAR
DORCAS KNOWING HOW RACHEL THOUGHT UPON IT HAD GROWN RESERVED AND IMPENETRABLE UPON THE SUBJECT
THEY WERE BY THIS TIME WALKING SIDE BY SIDE
WILL ANSWER LARK'S QUESTIONS WHICH ARE NOT HE THINKS VERY IMPERTINENT
AT NINE O'CLOCK THEREFORE HE PRESENTED HIMSELF ATTENDED BY HIS LEGAL HENCHMEN AS BEFORE
I THINK THAT IS ALL
BEFORE THE DIVISION
IT WAS A BROAD-FACED LETTER OF BLUISH COMPLEXION AND HAD MADE INQUISITION AFTER ME IN THE COUNTRY--HAD ASKED FOR ME AT QUEEN'S FOLKSTONE
WEALDON WAS AT BRANDON ABOUT SESSIONS BUSINESS AND AS USUAL FULL OF ELECTION STRATAGEMS AND CALCULATIONS
IF THIS THEORY WERE RIGHT WILLIAM WYLDER'S REVERSION WAS CERTAIN TO TAKE EFFECT
BUT OUR FRIEND STANLEY LAKE WAS ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHO THINK THAT THE COURSE OF THE WORLD'S AFFAIRS SHOULD BEND A GOOD DEAL TO THEIR PERSONAL CONVENIENCE AND HE WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THESE UNREASONABLE WORKING-PEOPLE WHO HAD GONE TO THEIR BEDS AND BROUGHT HIM TO THIS REMOTE AND GRIMY AMPHITHEATRE OF BLACK WINDOWS FOR NOTHING
BUT ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS TRISTE AND TIRESOME--ONLY A STORY OF DIFFICULTIES AND PETTY VEXATIONS
IN FACT I WOULD RATHER TELL IT THAN NOT
BUT SHE WAS A BOLD LASS AND NOT GIVEN IN ANYWISE TO THE MELTING MOOD AND SAID GAILY WITH HER OPEN HAND STILL CARESSINGLY ON DORCAS'S WAIST I MAKE A VERY GOOD NUN DORCAS AS I TOLD STANLEY THE OTHER DAY
ONLY THROWN MISS INTO THE DELL
OF COURSE YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LAKE IN ALLUDING TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MY MAKING ANY COMMUNICATION TO LORD CHELFORD I LIMIT MYSELF STRICTLY TO THE LETTER OF SIR JULIUS HOCKLEY AND DO NOT BY ANY MEANS MY DEAR CAPTAIN LAKE INCLUDE THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAS JUST OCCURRED AND THE COMMUNICATION WHICH YOU HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO MAKE ME OH
AND HE FELT MOREOVER AS IF HE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GUESS WHO HE WAS
IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE CAPTAIN WAS GONE
THE DOOR OF THE LIBRARY OPENED AND SHE WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED TO SEE STANLEY ENTER
AND THE POOR LITTLE WOMAN QUITE RELIEVED WENT OFF IMMEDIATELY IN HER GRATITUDE TO RACHEL AND PAID HER QUITE AN AFFECTIONATE LITTLE VISIT
AN ACQUIESCENCE A FAINT EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE A FAINTER SMILE--SHE CONTRIBUTED LITTLE MORE AFTER THE FIRST FEW QUESTIONS OF COURTESY HAD BEEN ASKED IN HER LOW SILVERY TONES AND ANSWERED BY ME
THEY DREW UP AT THE BRANDON ARMS AND LITTLE GIRLS COURTESIED AT DOORS AND HOUSEHOLDERS PEEPED FROM THEIR WINDOWS NOT STANDING CLOSE TO THE PANES BUT RESPECTFULLY BACK AT THE GREAT LADY AND THE NOBLEMAN WHO WAS NOW TAKING HIS LEAVE
C WHEN JOS
AND I THE LANDSCAPE AND THE WHISTLING OF THE BIRDS
AND SIMPLY BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER IN THE COURSE OF MY LIFE DONE A SINGLE ACT UNWORTHY OF A GENTLEMAN OR IN THE MOST TRIFLING WAY COMPROMISED MYSELF
HE GRASPED THE SWITCH IN HIS HAND AS IF TO STRIKE HER
NOW I SAY YOU SHALL AND WITH EVERY ENERGY AND FACULTY YOU POSSESS OR ELSE ABIDE THE CONSEQUENCES AND I TELL YOU SIR REPLIED RACHEL I KNOW YOU
AND LAKE ADDED WHAT A D--D CUNNING FELLOW YOU ARE
YOU ARE WORSE THAN SIR HARRY BRACTON--FOR YOU'RE NO FOOL
QUIET--QUIET--CAN'T YOU I SAY
SHE STEPPED INTO HER LITTLE KITCHEN--ALWAYS A FAIRY KITCHEN SO TINY SO WHITE SO RADDLED AND SHINING ALL OVER WITH THAT PLEASANTEST OF ALL EFFULGENCE--BURNISHED TINS PEWTERS AND THE HOMELY DECORATIONS OF THE DRESSER--AND SHE LOOKED ALL ROUND AND SMILED PLEASANTLY AND KISSED OLD TAMAR AND SAID SO MY DEAR OLD FAIRY HERE'S YOUR CINDERELLA HOME AGAIN FROM THE BALL AND I'VE SEEN NOTHING SO PRETTY AS THIS SINCE I LEFT REDMAN'S FARM
AND SUDDENLY MR CRUMP
AND LARKIN SAYS WITH SMART MANAGEMENT I SHALL HAVE A RENTAL OF THIRTEEN THOUSAND BEFORE THREE YEARS
BUT CURABLE ON SHORT ABSENCES AND EASILY TRANSFERABLE
WE EXPECT SIR FRANCIS THIS MORNING
BUT HER GAZE WAS SUCH AS I ONCE SAW THE SAME PROUD AND HANDSOME FACE TURN UPON THE DEAD--PALE EXQUISITE PERHAPS A LITTLE STERN
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE D I STAY IN HIS HOUSE ONE REASON WAS PERHAPS THAT IT SAVED HIM NEARLY A GUINEA A DAY AND HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME OTHER LITTLE REASONS JUST THEN
THE SEED DIES TO OUTWARD SENSE AND DESPAIR FOLLOWS
AND WENT TO BED AFTER A CALM AND PLEASED REVIEW OF HIS MEMORANDA AND SLEPT THE SLEEP OF THE RIGHTEOUS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS
AND HE PROPOSES MAKING LORD VISCOUNT CHELFORD AND CAPTAIN LAKE TRUSTEES TO FUND HIS MONEY OR OTHERWISE INVEST IT FOR HIS USE AND HAS HE--I BEG PARDON--BUT DID HE MENTION A LITTLE MATTER IN WHICH I AM DEEPLY--INDEED VITALLY INTERESTED THE VICAR PAUSED
WELL SO I BELIEVE SHE IS BUT I CAN'T FANCY HER
SHE TURNED FROM THE WINDOW INTENDING TO WRITE TWO LETTERS WHICH SHE HAD OWED TOO LONG--YOUNG LADIES LETTERS--FOR MISS LAKE LIKE MANY OF HER SEX AS I AM TOLD HAD SEVERAL LITTLE CORRESPONDENCES ON HER HANDS
THE WHITE PARCHMENT--THE BLUE AND SILVER STAMPS IN THE CORNER--THE GERMAN TEXT AND FLOURISHES AT THE TOP AND THOSE BROAD HORIZONTAL LINES OF RECITAL `HABENDUM AND SO FORTH--MARSHALLED LIKE AN ARMY IN PROCESSION BEHIND HIS MARCH OF TRIUMPH INTO FIVE OAKS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF ITS DEPOSED PRINCE
BUT YOU HAD NO EXCUSE AND EVERY OPPORTUNITY--AND YOU HAVE ALLOWED YOUR COUSIN STANLEY TO BE MURDERED YOU DO ME GREAT INJUSTICE DORCAS
AND THE TRUTH IS I BELIEVE IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT CHANCE OF SEEING AND INTERRUPTING YOU I SHOULD NOT HAVE PASSED THROUGH REDMAN'S DELL TO-DAY HE LAUGHED A LITTLE AS HE SAID THIS
THERE WAS ALSO THIS PASSAGE FEELING ACUTELY THE ANXIETY INTO WHICH THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE PURCHASER MUST THROW YOU--THOUGH I TRUST NOTHING OF THAT SORT MAY OCCUR--I TOLD THEM THAT RATHER THAN HAVE YOU THROWN UPON YOUR BEAM-ENDS BY SUCH AN OCCURRENCE I WOULD MYSELF STEP IN AND PURCHASE ON THE TERMS AGREED ON
THESE WERE AUNT JEMIMA'S I THINK YES
THERE WAS NOTHING QUITE NEW IN THE SITUATION THEREFORE
WHAT A DREARY THING A DINNER PARTY MADE UP OF SUCH PEOPLE MUST BE--LIKE AESOP'S FABLES WHERE THE COWS AND SHEEP CONVERSE AND SOMETIMES A WOLF OR A FOX SHE SAID
AND REALLY IF I WERE TO STAY HERE AND TRY TO EXPLAIN I VERY MUCH DOUBT WHETHER I COULD
YOU'LL WANT THE MONEY AND YOU MUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO SELL FIVE OAKS CAPTAIN LAKE SHIFTED HIS FOOT AS IF HE HAD FOUND IT ON A SUDDEN ON A HOT FLAG
AND NOT BEING UNDER ANY PERSONAL OBLIGATIONS TO HER I CONFESS MY ACQUIESCENCE IN THE SPIRIT OF CAPTAIN LAKE'S REMARKS
NOW YOU'RE NOT ANGRY WITH ME RADIE DEAR
I BELIEVE I OUGHT TO HAVE WITHDRAWN A LITTLE I SAID VERY HUMBLY
DON'T YOU REMEMBER HOW OUR GREAT ANCESTOR WHO FOUGHT FOR THE HOUSE OF YORK CHANGED SUDDENLY TO LANCASTER AND HOW SIR RICHARD LEFT THE KING AND TOOK PART WITH CROMWELL NOT FOR ANY PARTICULAR ADVANTAGE I BELIEVE OR FOR ANY PARTICULAR REASON EVEN BUT FOR WICKEDNESS AND WOUNDED PRIDE PERHAPS I DON'T QUITE SEE YOUR MEANING DORCAS
BUT HE HAD A RIGHT TO GO TO DONDALE'S IF HE PLEASED INSTEAD OF THAT CHEAP HOSTELRY NEAR COVENT GARDEN
ON A CABINET NEAR TO WHERE SHE STOOD WAS A CASKET OF ORMOLU WHICH SHE UNLOCKED AND TOOK OUT A MINIATURE OPENED AND LOOKED AT IT FOR A LONG TIME
AND A SIMILAR ONE ONLY SHORTER FOUND LAWYER LARKIN IN HIS PLEASANT BREAKFAST PARLOUR
BUT HE THOUGHT SO EXTREME A MEASURE WOULD HARDLY BE CONTEMPLATED NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR THREATS UNLESS THE PURCHASER WERE TO WITHDRAW OR THE VENDOR TO EXHIBIT SYMPTOMS OF--HE WOULD NOT REPEAT THEIR PHRASE--IRRESOLUTION IN HIS DEALING
AND THEN HE ORDERED A FLY AND DROVE IN IT TO LAWYER LARKIN'S HOUSE--'THE LODGE IT WAS CALLED--AND ENTERED MR LARKIN'S DRAWING-ROOM VERY CHEERFULLY
THEN THERE WAS THAT BEAUTIFUL APATHETIC DORCAS BRANDON
THIS GENERAL LIKING FOR CHILDREN AND INSTINCT OF SMILING ON THEM IS ONE SOURCE OF THE DELIGHTFUL ILLUSIONS WHICH MAKE THE REMEMBRANCE OF EARLY DAYS SO LIKE A DREAM OF PARADISE AND GIVE US AT STARTING SUCH FALSE NOTIONS OF OUR VALUE
BUT EVEN IN THESE BE KNEW HOW TO COMMAND HIMSELF PRETTY WELL BEFORE WITNESSES
HE DISGUSTS THE WORLD WITH HIS HANG-DOG LOOKS
LAKE ASKED WILLIAM WYLDER PERHAPS HE WILL BE WITH US
GLAD TO HAVE A SHARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OFF MY SHOULDERS I CAN TELL YOU
THE BAND WAS PLAYING POP GOES THE WEASEL AND OLD JACKSON VERY WELL DRESSED AND BUCKLED UP WITH A SPLENDID SMILE UPON HIS WAGGISH MILITARY COUNTENANCE CRIED AS HE PASSED WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND HOW DO LAKE--HOW DO MR LARKIN--BEAUTIFUL DAY I'VE NO WISH TO INJURE MARK
NO NO MISS DORKIE WON'T GIVE US MUCH TROUBLE HE USED TO CALL HER MISS DORKIE PLAYFULLY TO HIS CLERKS
AND YOU WON'T ATTRIBUTE WHAT I SAY TO IMPERTINENT CURIOSITY
IT WAS ABOUT THE HOUR WHEN HE WAS LIKELY TO FIND LAKE IN HIS STUDY
I THINK SO SAID THE BARONET IN A BLUFF FIRM WAY
A FELLOW DOESN'T WANT TO PUT HIMSELF INTO THE HANDS OF A STRANGER ALTOGETHER ESPECIALLY A LAWYER HA HA
AND A SUPERB HAUGHTINESS QUITE UNAFFECTED
AND NOBODY TO ADVISE BUT THAT VILLAGE DOCTOR BUDDLE--THAT'S HARDLY CREDIBLE I THINK PARDON ME
AND HIS BOOTS WERE SOILED WITH CLAY AND HIS WRAPPING COAT MARKED HERE AND THERE WITH THE GREEN OF THE STEMS AND BRANCHES OF TREES THROUGH WHICH HE HAD MADE HIS WAY
JEALOUSY IS VERY UNREASONABLE
I WAS THERE AND HOCKLEY WAS THERE AND MARK WYLDER WAS THERE--WAS NOT HE AND LAKE STARED AND LAUGHED AND THE ATTORNEY STARED
THE SPLENDID YOUNG BRIDE WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON THE STAGE WHO LOOKED VERY MUCH AS USUAL
YOU MUST NOT TREAT ME AS RACHEL HAS
ALL IS OVER BETWEEN ME AND MR WYLDER--QUITE OVER--FOR EVER UPON MY LIFE YOUNG LADY THIS IS BEING VERY SHARP INDEED
A SEALED ENVELOPE BROKEN
I LEFT IT BEHIND
LARKIN WAS ALWAYS IN HER MIND
INDEED I MAY MENTION I HAVE REASON TO THINK SO--IN FACT TO KNOW THAT SUCH IS THE CASE
HE SOMETIMES HEARD THINGS NOT WHOLLY VALUELESS AND ONCE OR TWICE HAD GATHERED HINTS IN THIS WAY WHICH SAVED HIM TROUBLE OR MONEY WHICH IS MUCH THE SAME THING
YOU OR I MAY OVER-ESTIMATE THAT DANGER BEING SO NEARLY AFFECTED BY IT
THE LAUGH THOUGH LOW SOUNDED WILD AND HOLLOW IN THAT DARK SOLITUDE
FOR ALTHOUGH THE VICAR WAS INFLEXIBLE SHE HAD PREVAILED WITH HIS WIFE WHO AT PARTING AGAIN PROMISED RACHEL THAT IF SHE COULD DO IT THE SALE SHOULD BE STOPPED
AND TO JUDGE BY HIS FACE WAS TRANSLATED FROM THE GLARE OF THAT ARENA INTO A DARK AND SPLENETIC WORLD OF HIS OWN
BEAUTIFUL CHAPEL THIS CAPTAIN LAKE--BEAUTIFUL CHAPEL SIR SAID THE ATTORNEY AGAIN LOOKING ROUND WITH A DREARY SMILE OF ADMIRATION
I COULD NOT AFFORD TO ADMIRE HER IF SHE HAD NOT
MR LARCOM HAD NO THEORY WHATSOEVER TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS PROCEDURE ON THE PART OF HIS MASTER
AND THINKING OF THE SIGNED ARTICLES WITHIN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH AN ANGELIC HAND HAD PLACED THEM THERE WHILE HE SLEPT SO WONDROUS WAS IT ALL
PER ANNUM AND TEN PER CENT
BUT THAT YOU KNOW YOU ARE ALWAYS WELCOME
WHEN HE REACHED THE DOOR UNCLE LORNE SUDDENLY STOPPED AND FACED US WITH A COUNTENANCE OF WRATH AND FEAR AND THREW UP HIS ARMS IN AN ATTITUDE OF DENUNCIATION BUT SAID NOTHING
ONLY THAT MR LARKIN WAS ALTOGETHER THE MAN HE WAS I THINK HE WOULD HAVE CURSED FREELY
CAN I CONJECTURE WHY HE IS GONE MURMURED RACHEL STILL GAZING WITH A WILD KIND OF APATHY INTO DISTANCE
THE LADIES ON GYLINGDEN HEATH
FROM THE HIGH GLASS DOORWAY COMMUNICATING WITH THE DRAWING-ROOMS AT THE FAR END AMONG TOWERING RANKS OF RARE AND GORGEOUS FLOWERS OVER THE ENCAUSTIC TILES AND THROUGH THIS ATMOSPHERE OF PERFUME DID CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE IN HIS SHOOTING COAT GLIDE SMILING TOWARD HIS BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WIFE
THERE ARE REASONS QUITE HONOURABLE I NEED NOT TELL YOU WHICH MAKE IT NECESSARY JAMES DUTTON THAT THE WHOLE OF THIS AFFAIR SHOULD BE KEPT PERFECTLY TO OURSELVES
I DID NOT MEAN TO PRAY
IT FOLLOWS THE GENERAL LAW OF MORTALITY
SOMETHING MUST BE DONE IN THE MATTER I SPOKE OF IMMEDIATELY
WHEN THEY HAD TALKED TOGETHER FOR A WHILE THE CAPTAIN SAID THE FACT IS IT IS NOT QUITE ON ME YOU WOULD HAVE TO ATTEND
COME NOW DORCAS--I'M SORRY--I'M SUCH A BRUTE YOU KNOW WHEN I'M VEXED
THE STAKES WERE ENORMOUS
DO BEG OF HIM IN MY NAME--AND I KNOW MR LARKIN WOULD WISH IT SO MUCH AND SO LORD CHELFORD WITH A LOOK WHICH AT ANOTHER TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AMUSED ONE QUITE CONSCIOUS OF THE ODDITY OF HIS INTRODUCTION CAME IN AND SLIGHTLY SALUTED MR LARKIN WHO WAS FOR A FEW SECONDS PRETTY OBVIOUSLY CONFOUNDED AND WITH A PINK FLUSH ALL OVER HIS BALD FOREHEAD TRIED TO SMILE WHILE HIS HUNGRY LITTLE EYES SEARCHED THE VISCOUNT WITH FEAR AND SUSPICION
HIS HEAD WAS BUSY ENOUGH AT THAT MOMENT THOUGH IT WAS QUITE STILL AND HIS SLY EYES RESTED ON HIS PRAYER-BOOK
I'M SHOT
CAPTAIN LAKE HE WAS CONFIDENT KNEW JAMES DUTTON--WHY OTHERWISE SHOULD THAT PERSON HAVE DESIRED HIS INTELLIGENCE COMMUNICATED TO HIM
THIS GENTLEMAN WAS SIMPLY A MASS OF CLOAKS AND CAPES CULMINATING IN A QUEER BATTERED FELT HAT
SUCH WERE SOME OF THIS DANGEROUS FELLOW'S WEAK POINTS
THERE WERE OLD BRANDON AND WYLDER MONUMENTS BUILT UP AGAINST THE WALLS
I THINK MISS LAKE IT IS PRETTY PLAIN YOU ARE NOT ACTING FOR YOURSELF HERE--YOU HAVE BEEN SENT MA'AM SAID THE ATTORNEY LOOKING VERY VICIOUS AND SPEAKING A LITTLE HUSKILY AND HURRIEDLY
HOW COULD SHE TELL WHAT IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT PORTEND
AS TO HER RESIDING WITH YOU AS SHE PROPOSES MISS LAKE IS WELL AWARE THAT I AM COGNIZANT OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH RENDER ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENT ABSOLUTELY IMPRACTICABLE
SOME WONDERED WHAT MIGHT BE THE DISEASE OF THAT PALE PEEVISH-LOOKING GENTLEMAN WHO SAT THERE SO STILL LANGUID AND DEJECTED
YES YES VERY DILIGENT
AND THEN THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE--THE SILENCE OF A FATIGUE LIKE THAT OF FEVER NEAR WHICH SLEEP REFUSES TO COME
AND FURTHER THAT HE CAPTAIN LAKE MUST PERFECTLY COMPREHEND IF HE COULD NOT APPRECIATE THE REASONS WHICH WOULD FOR EVER BAR ANY SUCH RELATION
BUT WHAT GIRL OF ENERGY AND STRONG AFFECTIONS WOULD HAVE HAD THE MELANCHOLY COURAGE TO SURRENDER HER BROTHER TO PUBLIC JUSTICE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
AND THOUGH DIGNIFIED OF COURSE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY MILD AND GRACIOUS WITH ALL HIS SERVANTS THAT EVENING AND EXPOUNDED AT FAMILY PRAYERS IN A SENSE THAT WAS LIBERAL AND COMFORTING
BUT EVEN THEN IT IS ONLY BEGUN
IF THE SECRET WERE ALL MY OWN--HEAVEN KNOWS HATEFUL AS IT IS HOW BOLDLY I WOULD RISK ALL AND THROW MYSELF ON YOUR FIDELITY OR YOUR MERCY--I KNOW NOT HOW YOU MIGHT VIEW IT
AND COMING DOWN TO HIS SITTING-ROOM HE LOOKED INTO HIS MORNING PAPER AND THEN INTO THE STREET AND TOLD THE SERVANT AS HE SATE DOWN TO BREAKFAST THAT HE EXPECTED A GENTLEMAN NAMED WYLDER TO CALL THAT MORNING AND TO BE SURE TO SHOW HIM UP DIRECTLY
I HAVE PASSED A DAY OF SUCH DREADFUL AGITATION
AND IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN NECESSARY TO SAY MY HONEY MY LOVE AND MY DEAR THAT GOOD SOUL WOULD NOT HAVE SAID IT AND YOU MAY BE PRETTY SURE THAT IF SHE HAD NOT AND WITH THE SUITABLE BY-PLAY TOO SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE RIDDEN TO GAMWELL THAT DAY AND YOU DON'T THINK YOU COULD HAVE PERSUADED YOURSELF TO REPEAT THAT LITTLE CHARM WHICH OBTAINED HER BOON AND ONE OF HIS HORSES STRAIGHTWAY SAID LORD CHELFORD
GIVE ME YOUR PROMISE STANLEY TELL ME ONCE MORE ARE YOU REALLY QUITE FRANK WHEN YOU TELL ME THAT YOU APPREHEND NO PERSONAL INJURY FROM THESE PEOPLE--APART I MEAN FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF MR LARKIN'S CONSPIRING TO IMPEACH OUR RIGHTS IN FAVOUR OF MR WYLDER PERSONAL INJURY
AND THEN FOLLOWED A SHORT SILENCE
YOU WILL NOT PRESS ME MY DEAR SIR
I'VE HAD--A--SUCH A LETTER FROM MY--MY CLIENT MR MARK WYLDER
MY RESPECTED CLIENT MR MARK WYLDER IS SUFFERING UNDER SOME ACUTE PRESSURE APPLIED PERHAPS BY MY FRIEND CAPTAIN LAKE
4_D YET IN THAT SIMILAR INSTITUTION WHICH FLOURISHED AT NAUNTON ONLY NINE MILES AWAY THERE STOOD TO HIS NAME THE SATISFACTORY CREDIT OF 564_L
D--D HUMBUG
I DON'T THINK HE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD OPINION OF THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN
I HAVE BEEN THINKING HE TAKES AIRS AND MAYBE HE IS ON HIS HIGH-HORSE ABOUT THAT AWKWARD BUSINESS ABOUT MISS BRANDON
AND THIS OTHER MOTIVE TOO EXISTED FOR RETAINING HIM IN THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE THAT BY PREVENTING HIS MARRIAGE AND HIS HAVING A FAMILY TO SUCCEED HIM THE REVERSION OF HIS BROTHER WILLIAM WAS REDUCED TO A CERTAINTY AND WOULD BECOME A MAGNIFICENT INVESTMENT FOR STANLEY LAKE WHENEVER HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO PURCHASE
AWFUL SHE WAS AND PROMPT TO LECTURE YOUNG PEOPLE BEFORE THEIR PEERS AND SPOKE HER MIND WITH FEARFUL DIRECTNESS AND PRECISION
I WON'T TELL HIM AND YOU SHA'N'T
AND I CAN SHOW YOU THE EVIDENCE ON WHICH MY CONCLUSIONS RESTED THANK YOU--NO SIR
BUT I DOUBT IF OUR TALK WOULD QUITE STAND THE TEST OF PRINT
WELL NO ONE ELSE SUSPECTED THAT INCIPIENT MADNESS--THAT WAS SOMETHING
JUST IN YOUR USUAL WAY MURMURED MR LARKIN
AND SHE LOOKED AT HIM STEADILY WITH A FAINT SMILE AND ARCHED BROWS FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND AN UNDEFINABLE EXPRESSION OF PUZZLE AND CURIOSITY
DON'T THEY SOMETIMES ACTUALLY ADMIRE WHAT IS REPULSIVE
AND I WILL TAKE NO STEP IN SELLING A PART OF OUR ESTATE TO THAT ODIOUS MR LARKIN WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM AND AT LEAST HEARING WHAT HE THINKS OF IT STANLEY'S EYES WERE CAST DOWN--AND HE WAS NIPPING THE STRUGGLING HAIRS OF HIS LIGHT MOUSTACHE BETWEEN HIS LIPS--BUT HE MADE NO ANSWER
I'VE BEEN I'M AFRAID VERY IMPERTINENT
IN FACT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE NEXT TEN MINUTES MIGHT BRING HIM
THE FLEXIBLE AND ANGRY JOS
HERE'S THREE THINGS FOR YOU 1
WHAT COULD ALL THE WORLD DO TO HARM HIM IN FREE ENGLAND IF HE WERE INNOCENT IF HE WERE WHAT HE SEEMED--NO WORSE THAN HIS SOCIAL PEERS
PERHAPS HE THOUGHT SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED TO AFFECT HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE
THE BRANDONS IN HER YOUNG DAYS WERE NOT WANTING IN SPIRIT
FLATTERING OF MANKIND I AM SURE I HAVE NO TALENT FOR
THE WORST OF THESE IS THAT UNLIKE OTHER TROUBLES THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS SAFELY TO BE COMMUNICATED TO THOSE WHO LOVE US BEST
I COULD NOT GET MY NERVES INTO A COMFORTABLE STATE AND CHEERFUL THOUGHTS REFUSED TO INHABIT THE DARKENED CHAMBER OF MY BRAIN
MARK'S IDEAS OF LADIES AND OF PROPRIETY WERE LOW AND HE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN A SAILOR ASHORE AND NOT A GOOD SPECIMEN OF THAT CLASS OF MONSTER
IS NOT IT MELANCHOLY SAID LARKIN IN HIS FINEST AND MOST PATHETIC HORROR
LITTLE FAIRY AFTER ALL WAS BETTER
HE SAID HE HAD A BAD BRUISE UNDER HIS RIBS AND A SPRAINED WRIST AND WAS A LITTLE BIT SHAKEN
MR LARKIN WOULD TAKE A SHORT WALK AND AS HIS BUSINESS WAS PRESSING HE WOULD TAKE THE LIBERTY OF LOOKING IN AGAIN IN ABOUT HALF-AN-HOUR IF SHE THOUGHT HER MISTRESS WOULD BE AT HOME THEN
SEND HER MAID AYE SEND HER MAID CRIED CAPTAIN LAKE TO LARCOM
SHE DESIRED ME SIR PLEASE TO GIVE IT INTO YOUR OWN HAND IF I COULD AND NOT TO LEAVE IT PLEASE SIR UNLESS YOU WERE AT HOME WHEN I REACHED HE READ THE DIRECTION AND DROPPED IT UNOPENED INTO THE POCKET OF HIS SHOOTING COAT
DORCAS THIS IS MY OLD FRIEND CHARLES DE CRESSERON
AND INDEED IT WAS SUCH A SMILE AS MUST HAVE MADE IT HAPPY--AND SHE SAID GAILY YOU FORGET THAT LORD CHELFORD PASSES THIS WAY SOMETIMES AND SHINES UPON THEM TOO NO HE'S A DULL EARTHLY DOG
LARKIN AT TIMES THOUGHT THERE WAS A CONSTANT AND SECRET CORRESPONDENCE GOING ON BETWEEN HIM AND MARK WYLDER AND THAT HE WAS HIS AGENT IN ADJUSTING SOME COMPLICATED AND VILLAINOUS PIECE OF DIPLOMACY BY MEANS OF THE FUND--SECRET-SERVICE MONEY--WHICH MARK HAD PLACED AT HIS DISPOSAL
THEN THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE
TWO ANGELS BURIED HIM ALIVE IN VALLOMBROSA BY NIGHT
FOR AS I HAVE SAID SHE INTERESTED ME STRANGELY
RACHEL'S TALKS WITH THE VICAR WERE FREQUENT
LARKINS'S SPECULATIONS HAVE NOT TURNED OUT LUCKILY
AND I STATE THIS NOT IN VINDICATION OF HER BUT TO LEND WEIGHT TO THE CAUTION I GIVE YOU AGAINST EVER AGAIN PRESUMING TO CONNECT HER NAME WITH YOUR SURMISES THE PEER'S COUNTENANCE WAS SO INEXPRESSIBLY STERN AND HIS EYES POURED SUCH A STREAM OF FIRE UPON THE ATTORNEY THAT HE SHRANK A LITTLE AND LOOKED DOWN UPON HIS GREAT FINGERS WHICH WERE DRUMMING LET US HOPE SOME SACRED MUSIC UPON THE TABLE
HIS LEAF ALSO SHALL NOT WITHER
THE MEAN TYRANNICAL TRIUMPHANT GAZE OF THE ATTORNEY WAS UPON HIM AND HIS OWN COUNTENANCE WAS HIS ACCUSER
AS WORLDS FIRST BEGIN IN THINNEST VAPOUR AND WHIRL THEMSELVES IN TIME INTO CONSISTENCY AND FORM SO DO THESE DARK MACHINATIONS WHICH AT TIMES GATHER ROUND UNSUSPECTING MORTALS AS POINTS OF REVOLUTION BEGIN NEBULOUSLY AND INTANGIBLY AND GROW IN VOLUME AND IN DENSITY TILL A COLOSSAL SYSTEM WITH ITS INEXORABLE TENDENCIES AND FORCES CRUSHES INTO ETERNAL DARKNESS THE CENTRE IT HAS ENVELOPED
HE'S NOTHING TO ME YOU HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD ME
AND I CAN EXPLAIN TO CHELFORD WHY I COULD NOT MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE
PARTICULARLY ITALY SAID LAKE
AND YOU CAN DO A GREAT DEAL
SO BUDDLE TOLD HIM ALL THAT WAS YET KNOWN AND HE LISTENED VERY ATTENTIVELY
AND CAN TAKE MY TURN AT THE WHEEL--EH AND HE LAUGHED WITH CUNNING EXULTATION
YOU ARE NERVOUS DARLING HE CONTINUED LAYING HIS HAND ON HERS
BUT THOUGH MARVELLOUSLY PRESERVED IN ITS THEN STATE CERTAINTY WAS HARDLY ATTAINABLE
AND IN YOURS I ONLY SEE THE IMAGE OF A LOST FRIEND
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER HIM NOR I EITHER PERHAPS--VERY LIKELY AND HE PUT THE LETTER IN HIS POCKET
HE WAS BETTER TO-DAY
I ALWAYS DO
YOU UNDERSTAND LARCOM DID UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY AND SO THIS LITTLE VISIT ENDED
YEARS AFTER WHEN JIM WAS EMIGRATING I BELIEVE LORD CHELFORD GAVE HIM A HANDSOME PRESENT
THERE HE SAW MRS M'INTYRE A CALEDONIAN LADY AT THIS HOUR SOMEWHAT MELLOW AND TALKATIVE
ARE YOU WELL DEAR ASKED RACHEL WHEN THEY REACHED HER ROOM
AND EVEN TOM WEALDON WAS SNORING IN THE FAIRY LAND OF DREAMS
FOR A MONTH AND THREE DAYS MR JOS
I TELL YOU I'LL LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED TO SAVE MYSELF
LADY CHELFORD'S WRATH WAS NOW TURNED ANEW UPON WYLDER--AND THE INCONVENIENCE OF HAVING NO VISIBLE OBJECT ON WHICH TO EXPEND IT WAS ONCE MORE PAINFULLY FELT
MR JOS
MR JOS
MR JOS
MR JOS
MR JOS
MR JOS
MR JOS
HE WAS STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE WINDOW AND SPRANG FORWARD AS PALE AS SHE AND GRASPED HER WITH A WHITE LEER THAT SHE NEVER FORGOT OVER HIS SHOULDER AND THE VENICE GLASS WAS SHIVERED ON THE GROUND
HE HAD CALLED TO MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE LEST MR DRIVER SHOULD BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION
WITH A SHRUG AND A STEALTHY GLANCE ROUND HIM CAPTAIN LAKE STARTED UP
THE FRONT OF THE TOWN HALL RESOUNDED WITH THE RING OF HORSE-HOOFS THE CRACK OF WHIPS THE BAWLING OF COACHMEN THE CLANK OF CARRIAGE STEPS AND CLANG OF COACH DOORS
OUR TALK GREW SLOW AND OUR SPIRITS SUBSIDED IN THIS CHANGED AND TENEBROSE SCENERY
NOT LIKE DORCAS THOUGH THE SAME BUT SOMETHING GHASTLY WAN GLITTERING AND TERRIBLE LIKE A PRIESTESS AT A SOLITARY SACRIFICE
BUT I NEVER LIKED HIM ALTHOUGH HE UNDOUBTEDLY HAD A SUPERFICIAL FASCINATION
I OFTEN THOUGHT IF ONE OF THOSE ARTISTS WHO PHOTOGRAPH LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT--THE QUIET CLEVER REPORTERS TO WHOM ENGLAND IS OBLIGED FOR SO MUCH OF HER DAILY ENTERTAINMENT OF HER SOCIAL KNOWLEDGE AND HER POLITICAL SAFETY WERE PENCIL IN HAND TO ENSCONCE HIMSELF BEHIND THE ARRAS AND PRESENT US AT THE CLOSE OF THE AGREEABLE BANQUET WITH A LITERAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE FEAST OF REASON WHICH WE GIVE AND TAKE WITH SO MUCH COMPLACENCY--WHETHER IT WOULD QUITE SATISFY US UPON RECONSIDERATION
AND I WON'T BE DENIED YOU ARE VERY GOOD DORCAS
ARE YOU COMING TO BRANDON THIS EVENING
PRETTY WELL THANK YE BUT AWFULLY FAGGED--UP ALL NIGHT AND NO USE BUT HOW IS HE ASKED THE MAJOR WITH A DREADFUL QUALM OF DISMAY
CHAPTER XXXVII
THE SUN GLIMMERED THROUGH THE BOUGHS BEHIND HER
SO THERE WAS NO DOUBTING IT LONGER
I DON'T SET UP FOR A LIGHT OR A SAINT
THERE WAS A RABBLE OF THE RAFF OF QUEEN'S BRACTON ALONG WITH HIM
THEN THEY WHISPERED TOGETHER FOR THREE OR FOUR MINUTES AND RACHEL CLASPED HER JEWELLED FINGERS TIGHT ACROSS HER FOREHEAD QUITE WILDLY FOR A MINUTE
I TOOK A WRONG STEP
CHAPTER LXXIV
AND THEY CAN'T COME TO-DAY CERTAINLY NOT AND POOR WILLIAM WYLDER BREATHED AGAIN IN THE DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF EVEN MOMENTARY ESCAPE AND FELT HE COULD HAVE EMBRACED HIS PRESERVER
OLD WATTLES NOT HALF-RECOVERED WENT BY THE EARLY TRAIN YESTERDAY WEALDON TELLS ME
AND DOLLY ALARMED AND EAGER QUITE AGREED WITH RACHEL THAT THE SALE MUST BE STOPPED AND SHE WOULD DO WHATEVER DEAR RACHEL BID HER
IN THE MEANTIME HOWEVER A WRIT REACHED THE HAND OF THE POOR VICAR OF NAUNTON FRIARS WHO WROTE IN EAGER AND CONFUSED TERROR TO A FRIEND IN THE MIDDLE TEMPLE ON THE DREAD SUMMONS AND LEARNED THAT HE WAS NOW IN COURT AND MUST APPEAR OR SUFFER JUDGMENT BY DEFAULT
HE MAINTAINED HIS CHARACTER AS A NICE SPOKEN GENTLEMAN BY ENQUIRING OF THE MAID WHO OPENED THE DOOR HOW THE LITTLE BOY WAS
AND KEEP THE HALL DOOR SHUT AND BOLTED AGAIN SHE NODDED
I KNOW YOU TOO WELL STANLEY
ONE WORD MORE STANLEY
I WAS MORE ELATED BY HER TRIFLING NOTICE OF ME THAN I CAN QUITE ACCOUNT FOR
YOU ARE TOO GOOD TO ME DOLLY
BUT THE GUARD KNEW NOTHING OF THE PARTY NEITHER DID THE PORTER TO WHOM THE GUARD PUT A SIMILAR QUESTION
IN HIS CLEVERNESS--LEST THE INADEQUATE PURCHASE-MONEY SHOULD UPSET HIS BARGAIN--HE OMITTED THE USUAL COVENANT GUARANTEEING THE VENDOR'S TITLE TO SELL THE FEE-SIMPLE AND RECITED MOREOVER THAT GRAVE DOUBTS EXISTING ON THE POINT IT WAS AGREED THAT THE SUM PAID SHOULD NOT EXCEED TWELVE YEARS PURCHASE
IT REALLY IS GROWING TOO ABSURD--A MERE ORDER UPON YOU TO HAND ME 200_L HOW I'M TO DISPOSE OF IT I HAVE NOT THE FAINTEST NOTION AND HE LAUGHED AGAIN
WE MUST CATCH THE UP MAIL TRAIN AT DOLLINGTON
FOR BY THE TIME LORD CHELFORD RETURNED THE OLD LADY HAD ASKED HIM TO STAY FOR DINNER WHICH HE DID NOTWITHSTANDING HIS MORNING DRESS TO HIS GREAT INWARD SATISFACTION BECAUSE HE COULD HENCEFORWARD MENTION THE OTHER DAY WHEN I DINED AT BRANDON OR OLD LADY CHELFORD ASSURED ME WHEN LAST I DINED AT BRANDON AND HE COULD MORE INTIMATELY SPEAK OF OUR FRIENDS AT BRANDON AND THE BRANDON PEOPLE AND IN SHORT THIS DINNER WAS VERY SERVICEABLE TO THE EXCELLENT ATTORNEY
I BEG PARDON SAID THE VICAR RISING WITH A SUDDEN SMILE AND GOING TO THE WINDOW
WITH A BEAUTIFUL AND I WAS BY THIS TIME SATISFIED A VERY SINGULAR AND INTERESTING WOMAN FOR HIS WIFE WHO MUST HAVE MARRIED HIM FOR LOVE PURE AND SIMPLE
THE FELLOW-PASSENGER AT THE OPPOSITE ANGLE LAY BACK ALL CLOAKS AND MUFFLERS WITH NOTHING DISTINCT EMERGING BUT THE FELT HAT AT TOP AND THE TIP--IT WAS ONLY THE TIP NOW--OF THE SHINING SHOE ON THE FLOOR
SOME CONCRETE PAGEANTRIES TO BE ABOLISHED AND REMOVED
IT WILL BE QUITE A HOLLOW THING--A ONE-INNINGS AFFAIR HAVE YOU EVER SEEN PAUL'S ELEVEN PLAY ASKED THE LAWYER CARELESSLY TAKING UP THE NEWSPAPER WHICH LAKE HAD LAID DOWN
HE WAS ALREADY GRUMBLING AT THE PRICE AND CERTAINLY WOULD STAND NO TRIFLING
BUT YOU SHALL NOT ENSNARE ME
HE IS THE GENTLEMAN JULIUS FOR WHOM IN THE WILL UNDER WHICH WE TAKE THOSE VERY ODD PROVISIONS ARE MADE--SUCH AS I BELIEVE NO ONE BUT A WYLDER OR A BRANDON WOULD HAVE DREAMED OF
AND HE LIKE THE POOR VICAR THOUGH FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS HAD GROWN INTENSELY ANXIOUS TO SELL
WELL IT IS NOT A THING YOU'D FORGET EASILY--AND INDEED IT WAS A VERY WELL KEPT SECRET AS WELL AS AN UGLY ONE AND LAKE SMILED IN HIS SLY QUIZZICAL WAY
OR A MYSTERY--OR EVEN A DREAM WELL--A DREAM
AND TO THAT TAMAR I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND AT LAST THANK GOD
THE BROUGHAM WILL BE WITH HER
SUCH AN EFFUSION
WELL THAT SHIP'S BLEW UP
HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND THEN AT RACHEL
THEN HE JOINED A CONVERSATION GOING ON BETWEEN DORCAS BRANDON AND THE VICAR HIS BROTHER
HE INTENDED BEING PERFECTLY INGENUOUS WITH LAKE AND SHOWING HIM THAT HE HAD NO SECRETS--NO CONCEALMENTS--ALL OPEN AS THE DAY'--BY PRODUCING THE LETTER IN WHICH THE NOTICE WAS ENCLOSED AND SUBMITTING IT FOR CAPTAIN LAKE'S PERUSAL
IN A TONE THAT WAS ICY AND BITTER SHE SAID TO SAVE MYSELF I WOULD NOT DO IT
HEARS I'M UP FOR THE COUNTY
HIS TEMPER CONTINUING SAVAGE ALL THAT EVENING AND IN A MODIFIED DEGREE IN THE SAME STATE FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER
SHE IS A WIDE-AWAKE YOUNG LADY AND NOTHING THE WORSE FOR THAT
LARKIN'S WAS OLD SIR MULGRAVE BRACTON--THE DEFUNCT PARENT OF THE SIR HARRY WITH WHOM WE ARE ACQUAINTED
THE SHERIFF'S ALL RIGHT
WHY DID TIME LIMP SO TEDIOUSLY AWAY WITH HIM PROLONGING HIS ANGUISH GRATUITOUSLY
THE VICAR READ IT WITH A VAGUE COMPREHENSION AND IN HIS COLD FINGERS SHOOK THE HAND OF HIS FELLOW SUFFERER
AM I TO CONCLUDE THAT YOU WITHDRAW FROM YOUR ENGAGEMENT ASKED MR LARKIN
HE HAS NOT APPOINTED ANOTHER MAN OF BUSINESS OH DEAR NO SAID LARKIN QUICKLY WITH A FAINT SUPERCILIOUS SMILE
AND INDEED I DON'T QUITE COMPREHEND
CHAPTER LXIX
HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING FELLOW
WHAT IS HIS AILMENT GASTRIC FEVER THE DOCTOR SAYS
I DON'T KNOW PRECISELY WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT
CHAPTER XVII
AND THE GOOD VICAR COMES OFTEN--THIS IS ONE OF HIS DAYS--WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BOY AND TALKS SO WELL AND ANSWERS MY FOLLIES AND EXPLAINS ALL MY PERPLEXITIES AND IS REALLY A GREAT HELP AND COMFORT YES SAID LORD CHELFORD WITH THE SAME PLEASANT SMILE HE TOLD ME SO
THE VICAR WAS NOT IN THE LEAST SURPRISED WHEN MARK CAME IN FOR A FORTUNE
MAYBE IN ENGLAND AND THERE WRITES THESE LETTERS WHICH ARE SENT FROM ONE CONTINENTAL TOWN TO ANOTHER TO BE POSTED AND THUS THE APPEARANCE OF LOCOMOTION IS KEPT UP
AND HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY WELL YOU KNOW RADIE WOMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS
THAT HE MENTIONED THIS LEST MISAPPREHENSION SHOULD ARISE BUT NOT AS ATTACHING ANY IMPORTANCE TO THE SUPPOSED DISCOVERY WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY MR MARK WYLDER'S DEATH
I EXPECT HER AT NINE
MARK WYLDER'S RETURN BODED SHE BELIEVED SOMETHING TREMENDOUS
IT DID NOT STRIKE ME
I WILL NEVER BREAK IT AGAIN--IT WAS THOUGHTLESS
YES SIR GLAD O THAT SAID THE MAJOR LOOKING AFTER HIM
AND NOW AGAIN THE TRAIN SUBSIDED TO A STAND-STILL AND SHILLINGSWORTH RESOUNDED THROUGH THE NIGHT AIR AND LARKIN SCRAMBLED FORWARD TO THE WINDOW BY WHICH SAT THE ENVELOPED GENTLEMAN AND CALLED THE PORTER AND WITH MANY UNHEEDED APOLOGIES PULLED OUT HIS VARIOUS PROPERTIES CLOSE BY THE KNEES OF THE TRANQUIL TRAVELLER
SELF-PRESERVATION DEAR RADIE IS THE FIRST LAW OF NATURE FOR YOURSELF STANLEY
HE WENT TO HIS CLUB AND DINED BETTER THAN HE HAD DONE FOR MANY DAYS
AND HE LAID HIS HAT AND STICK AND GRAY PALETOT ON HER LITTLE MARQUETRIE-TABLE AND SAT DOWN AND LOOKED LANGUIDLY ABOUT HIM WITH A SLY SMILE LIKE A MAN AMUSED
I MAY BE QUITE MISTAKEN YOU KNOW BUT I WISHED YOU TO UNDERSTAND--HAVING SOME LITTLE EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD I'D BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO BE OF ANY USE IF YOU THOUGHT MY DIPLOMACY COULD HELP POOR WYLDER OUT OF HIS TROUBLE--THAT IS IF THERE REALLY IS ANY
THE LATE MARQUIS YOU KNOW PRIDED HIMSELF ON HIS HONEY--AND MY FRIEND THORNBURY COUSIN TO SIR FREDERICK THORNBURY--I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW HIM--AN EAST INDIAN JUDGE YOU KNOW--VERY KINDLY LEFT IT AT DOLLINGTON FOR ME ON HIS WAY TO THE EARL OF EPSOM'S THANK YOU--DELICIOUS I'M SURE IT HAS BEEN IN SUCH GOOD COMPANY
I CAN'T_--YOU CAN'T--SOONER OR LATER
AND THERE HAD BEEN FREQUENT INTERMARRIAGES--NOT VERY OFTEN HAPPY
MUCH OF THE DAY AS I TOLD YOU HAD BEEN PASSED AMONG THE GRISLY RECORDS OF THESE OLD FAMILY CRIMES AND HATREDS
DULY NEXT MORNING THE ROSY-FINGERED AURORA DREW THE GOLD AND CRIMSON CURTAINS OF THE EAST AND THE SPLENDID APOLLO STEPPING FORTH FROM HIS CHAMBER TOOK THE REINS OF HIS UNRIVALLED TEAM AND DRIVING FOUR-IN-HAND THROUGH THE SKY LIKE A GREAT SWELL AS HE IS TOOK SMALL NOTE OF THE STARING HUCKSTERS AND PUBLICANS BY THE ROAD-SIDE AND SUBLIMELY OVERLOOKED THE FOOTSORE AND RAGGED PEDESTRIANS THAT CRAWL BELOW HIS LEVEL
DON'T YOU THINK POSSIBLY MARK WYLDER MIGHT THINK US VERY IMPERTINENT I THINK CAPTAIN LAKE ON THE CONTRARY WE MIGHT BE DOING THAT GENTLEMAN THE ONLY SERVICE HE IS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING AND I KNOW WE SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING TOWARD TRACING AND EXPOSING THE MACHINATIONS OF A CONSPIRACY A CONSPIRACY
HE HANDED TO LORD CHELFORD A PARCEL OF THOSE CLEVER AND ELABORATE FORGERIES WITH WHICH LAKE HAD LAST FURNISHED HIM WITH A PENCILLED NOTE ON EACH DIRECTING THE DATE AND TOWN AT WHICH IT WAS TO BE DESPATCHED
I'M MEPHISTOPHELES I SUPPOSE AND YOU MARGARET OR SOME OTHER SIMPLE HEROINE--REBUKING THE FIEND IN THE MAJESTY OF YOUR PURITY AND INDEED IN THE REDDISH LIGHT AND IN THAT LONELY AND SOLEMN SPOT THE SLIM FORM OF THE CAPTAIN PALE SNEERING WITH HIS WILD EYES CONFRONTING THE BEAUTIFUL LIGHT-HAIRED GIRL LOOKED NOT QUITE UNLIKE A TYPE OF THE JAUNTY FIEND HE WAS PLEASED TO SUPPOSE HIMSELF
MY DEAR SIR I HAVE SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL
WHAT WAS MARK WYLDER'S RELIGION THAT I MAY SPEAK TO HIM COMFORTABLY AN ANABAPTIST I CONJECTURE FROM HIS PRESENT SITUATION REPLIED LAKE
I'M SURE DORKIE YOU MUST THINK ME A BRUTE
AND HE MIGHT BREAK HIS D--D NECK ANY TIME AMONG THOSE ROCKS AND GULLIES OR GET AWAY ALTOGETHER FROM YOU IN THE DARK SO THE KEEPER AT THE WATER'S BRINK JOINED UNCLE LORNE WHO WAS TALKING AFTER HIS FASHION INTO THE DARK POOL
SHE WAS PAST SIXTY WITH A MOURNFUL PUCKERED AND PUFFY FACE TINTED ALL OVER WITH A THIN GAMBOGE AND BURNT SIENNA GLAZING
SHE STOPPED WITH SOMETHING ALMOST WILD IN HER LOOK
WHAT DO YOU SAY--EH YOU MEAN TO COME OUT AS AN ORATOR THEN ORATOR BE DIDDLED
HE BROUGHT FORTH NO CIGAR-CASE WITH THE STEREOTYPED HAVE YOU ANY OBJECTION TO MY SMOKING A CIGAR HE DID NOT EVEN CHANGE HIS ATTITUDE EVER SO LITTLE
IT WAS PART OF HIS BUSINESS TO LOOK ALWAYS GRAVE AND HE COUGHED AND RECOVERED HIS GRAVITY
HAD HE PATRIOTISM ANY ONE NOBLE MOTIVE OR FINE INSTINCT TO PROMPT HIM TO PUBLIC LIFE
FOR I BEING A BACHELOR AND TREATED ACCORDINGLY WAS AIRILY PERCHED ON THE THIRD STOREY
THE SLAVE OF YOUR RING WORKS UNSEEN SO HE DOES LAUGHED WYLDER IN A STATE OF ELATION AND HE'S NOT DONE WORKING YET I CAN TELL YOU
BUT THE YOUNG LADY SHOWED NO SIGN OF EXCITEMENT AND LAY BACK IN HER CHAIR IN HER USUAL DEEP COLD CALM
I CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE TEMPER OTHERWISE--SO VIOLENT QUITE SO SAID LAKE QUIETLY
HE ONLY TOLD ME HE HAD MET YOU PRETTY OFTEN WHEN YOU WERE AT LADY ALTON'S LAST SEASON YES IN TOWN SHE ANSWERED A LITTLE DRILY
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL WAYWARD AND DARING AND ONE WAY OR ANOTHER MISFORTUNE ALWAYS WAYLAYS US
IT WAS CIRCUMLOCUTORY SAD AND MYSTERIOUS
SO THE DOCTOR THREW OPEN THE WINDOW-SHUTTERS AND CLIPPED STANLEY LAKE'S EXQUISITE COAT RUTHLESSLY THROUGH WITH HIS SCISSORS AND HAVING CLEARED THE ROOM OF ALL USELESS HANDS HE MADE HIS EXAMINATION
STANLEY LAKE DID NOT LIKE WAITING ANY MORE THAN DID LOUIS XIV
YES MY DEAR
OH MR LARCOM
I SUPPOSE SHE WAS GLAD AND TOOK THIS WAY OF SHOWING IT
BUT I AM SURE YOU ARE RIGHT
YOU'RE SUCH A DEMURE OLD MAID OF A CHAP
W
THEIR SWEETEST AND MERRIEST TONES HOVER MUSICALLY IN THE DISTANCE
BUT THE SIGHT OF ITS STEEP ROOF AND HOMELY CHIMNEY-STACKS SMOTE WITH A SHOCK AT HER BRAIN AND HEART--A TROUBLED MOAN ESCAPED HER
AND I THINK IF CAPTAIN LAKE DOES NOT TAKE CARE HE MAY GET INTO TROUBLE
WE ALLOW WYLDER YOU SEE TO COME EVERY DAY TO HIS DEVOTIONS
I MADE IT A POINT
WHEN AT THE LATER BREAKFAST UP AT BRANDON THAT IRREGULAR PENCILLED SCROLL REACHED LORD CHELFORD'S HAND HE SAID AS HE GLANCED ON THE DIRECTION THIS IS MARK WYLDER'S
INDEED QUITE SO--NINETY SHILLINGS A DOZEN I SHOULD VENTURE TO SAY AND HARDLY TO BE HAD AT THAT FIGURE
THERE'S A VERY NICE PLACE--AN ASYLUM OR SOMETHING FOR OLD WOMEN--NEAR--(DOLLINGTON HE WAS GOING TO SAY BUT THE ASSOCIATIONS WERE NOT PLEASANT)--NEAR SOME OF THOSE LITTLE TOWNS CLOSE TO THIS AND HE'S A VISITOR OR GOVERNOR OR WHATEVER THEY CALL IT
SHILLINGSWORTH
BUT WHAT CAN I SAY--HOW CAN I THANK YOU SAID THE VICAR CLASPING HER HAND
THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS WERE NOT WORKING BY ANY MEANS SO SMOOTHLY AS HE HAD EXPECTED
AND--HERE'S THE CARRIAGE AND IT DREW UP CLOSE TO THE STEPS AND RACHEL ENTERED
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM OR HIS AFFAIRS
WE BOTH KNOW DORCAS VERY WELL
I WONDER HOW MY SISTER IS THIS MORNING WOULD YOU LIKE A MESSENGER
AND ALL THIS MINUTE INFORMATION IS TRUSTWORTHY AND QUITE WITHOUT MALICE
OH DOLLY DOLLY OH WILLIE DARLING
AS WE WENT OUT WYLDER ENQUIRED WITH HIS USUAL GOOD TASTE
CERTAINLY REPLIED LADY CHELFORD
CHELFORD HAD A NOTE FROM MR WYLDER THIS MORNING--ANOTHER NOTE--HIS COMING DELAYED AND SOMETHING OF HIS HAVING TO SEE SOME PERSON WHO IS ABROAD CONTINUED DORCAS AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
CHAPTER LVIII
FOR LESS THAN HALF THE VALUE OF FIVE OAKS ALONE HE WAS GETTING THAT ESTATE AND A VASTLY GREATER ONE BESIDE TO BE SUCCEEDED TO ON MARK WYLDER'S DEATH
HERE IS MY STICK--AND I'LL RETURN IMMEDIATELY AND I'LL GO WITH YOU CRIED LITTLE FAIRY
HE HAD DONE ALL HE COULD TO OBVIATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FOLLY IN THIS CASE
MARK TRIED TO BULLY BUT THE COOL OLD HEADS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE THREW HIMSELF AT LAST ENTIRELY ON OUR MERCY--AND VERY ABJECT HE BECAME POOR THING HOW WELL THE MOUNTAINS LOOK
PERHAPS INDEED SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS WISDOM IN HIS ADVICE
BUT IT IS BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW AT ONCE THAN GO ABOUT POKING EVERYWHERE FOR INFORMATION I DO ASSURE YOU AND HAVING REALLY NO WISH TO HURT HIM PURSUED THE CAPTAIN AND ALSO MAKING IT AS I DO A POINT THAT YOU SHALL REPEAT THIS CONVERSATION AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE I DON'T CHOOSE TO APPEAR SINGULAR AS YOUR SOLE INFORMANT AND I'VE GIVEN YOU HERE A LINE TO SIR JAMES CARTER--HE'S MEMBER YOU KNOW FOR HUDDLESBURY
THE WOMAN MENTALLY EXCLAIMED LAKE TELEGRAPHING AT THE SAME TIME WITH A BOW AND A SMILE OF DEFERENTIAL ALACRITY AND MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD AS DEFTLY AS HE COULD
GOOD-NIGHT FOOLISH OLD TAMAR OH MASTER STANLEY IT WILL TAKE A DEAL TO SHAKE MY MIND
HE'S QUITE HARMLESS--HE WOULD NOT HURT A FLY
IT WAS CHEERFUL ALWAYS TILL THIS FRIGHTFUL WEEK CHANGED EVERYTHING
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S MY COUSIN OR WHO ISN'T
HE HAS HAD A HINT OR TWO ALREADY AND HE'LL NEVER FIGHT THE NEXT ELECTION
I'VE A LOT OF FELLOWS WITH ME
AND HE CONSEQUENTLY I SUPPOSE NEVER LIKED ME
HE LOOKED WISTFULLY ON THE LITTLE HATCH OF OLD WIDOW MADDOCK'S COTTAGE
IN THE MEANTIME OUR FRIEND CAPTAIN LAKE ARRIVED IN A HIRED FLY WITH HIS LIGHT BAGGAGE AT THE DOOR OF STATELY BRANDON
AND VISED BY MY COUSIN HAD PRESENTED ITSELF AT THE FRIARS IN SHROPSHIRE AND THENCE PROCEEDED BY SIR HARRY'S DIRECTION THERE WAS THE AUTOGRAPH TO NOLTON HALL
I DID NOT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT
ME SHE MAY HATE AND MUST DESPISE
AND THERE WAS THAT FELLOW WITH THE TWISTED MOUSTACHE--PLAINLY AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN--TWISTING THE END OF ONE OF THEM AND THINKING PROFOUNDLY WITH HIS BACK TO THE WALL EVIDENTLY CONSIDERING HIS COMING DIPLOMACY WITH LAKE'S FRIEND AYE BY-THE-BYE AND LAKE'S EYE WANDERED IN BEWILDERMENT AMONG VILLAGE DONS AND ELDERLY COUNTRY GENTLEMEN IN SEARCH OF THAT INESTIMABLE TREASURE
I DID NOT MIND LOOKING OUT AGAIN
HOW NEAR HE HAD BEEN TO PURCHASING THE VICAR'S REVERSION
IT IS A FRIGHTFUL PLIGHT
AND TO SAY TRUTH I WAS THINKING OF SAYING A WORD OR TWO JUST ABOUT AS IDEA THAT HAS BEEN IN MY MIND SOME TIME AND WHICH YOU HALF DIVINED--YOU ARE SO CLEVER--THE FIRST DAY I SAW YOU AT REDMAN'S FARM
IS THERE
JIM DUTTON MIGHT ARRIVE AT ANY MOMENT AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO RISK HIS PUBLISHING THE MELANCHOLY INTELLIGENCE OF MARK WYLDER'S DEATH BEFORE THE TRANSFER OF THE VICAR'S REVERSION
AND THUS MEMORY AND FORECAST AND SUSPENSE WERE SUPERSEDED FOR THE MOMENT BY ABSORBING MENTAL ACTION
IT IS ALL OVER LADY CHELFORD STARED AT THE AUDACIOUS YOUNG LADY WITH A LOOK OF INCENSED AMAZEMENT FOR SOME SECONDS UNABLE TO SPEAK
I HEARD IT ALL BEFORE I KNEW WHERE I WAS I REALLY THINK TAMAR YOU'VE TAKEN LEAVE OF YOUR WITS--YOU ARE QUITE IN THE CLOUDS
I CAN AND HE LAUGHED AND RUBBED HIS LONG FINGERS TOGETHER SOFTLY
BUT UNQUESTIONABLY A SNEER
SHALL I ASK MY MOTHER OR WILL YOU WRITE I WILL WRITE SHE SAID
TAMAR WAS IN THE KITCHEN
BUT STANLEY LAKE'S COLD COMMERCIAL GENIUS HIS CRAFT AND EGOTISM WERE FRUSTRATED OCCASIONALLY BY HIS TEMPER WHICH I AM AFRAID WITH ALL ITS EXTERNAL VARNISH WAS OF THE SORT WHICH IS STYLED DIABOLICAL
WELL WOMEN NEVER UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS
THE GIRL HAVING TURNED AWAY TO TITTER FORGOT LAKE'S GRAPES
OLD LADY CHELFORD OCCASIONALLY DOZED AND NODDED STERNLY AFTER TEA WAKING UP AND EYEING PEOPLE GRIMLY AS THOUGH ENQUIRING WHETHER ANYONE PRESUMED TO SUSPECT HER LADYSHIP OF HAVING HAD A NAP
HERE IT IS SHE DID NOT WATCH HIS COUNTENANCE OR LOOK IN HIS DIRECTION AS HE READ IT
WILL YOU JUST LOOK AT THAT--IT'S THE GLOBE'--ONLY SIX LINES AND TELL ME WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT CERTAINLY WEALDON AND I HAVE JOTTED DOWN A FEW NAMES HERE SAID LAKE SLIDING A LIST OF NAMES BEFORE ME
THE TRUTH WAS SHE RECOILED FROM IT WITH A SPECIES OF HORROR
LAKE SAID NOTHING--HE ONLY WHISPERED RATHER INDISTINCTLY ONE WORD WATER'--AND WAS NOT ABLE TO LIFT HIS HEAD WHEN IT CAME
YOU KNEW QUITE WELL LAST NIGHT THERE WAS TO BE THIS WICKED DUEL IN THE MORNING--AND YOU--A MAGISTRATE--A LORD-LIEUTENANT--WHAT ARE YOU?--YOU CONNIVED AT THIS BLOODY CONSPIRACY--AND HE_--YOUR OWN COUSIN CHELFORD--YOUR COUSIN CHELFORD LOOKED AT HER VERY MUCH AMAZED
PERHAPS IF THERE IS ANY DIFFICULTY YOU WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO SAY SO AND I SHALL THEN BE IN A POSITION TO CONSIDER THE CASE IN ITS NEW ASPECT WHAT THE DEVIL DIFFICULTY CAN THERE BE SIR
LITTLE MAN HAS NOT BEEN WELL YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY
HE DID NOT KNOW THE CITY WELL
AND INDEED IN NO SENSE WAS IT
FOR I WILL BE NO PARTY TO SEEING AN INNOCENT FAMILY COMPROMISED BY ADMITTING AN INMATE OF WHOSE REAL CHARACTER THEY HAVE NOT THE FAINTEST SUSPICION AND I SHALL AT ONCE SET IN MOTION A PUBLIC ENQUIRY INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MR MARK WYLDER'S DISAPPEARANCE LOOKING STRAIGHT IN HIS FACE WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION OF HELPLESSNESS SHE UTTERED AT LAST A HORRIBLE CRY OF ANGUISH THAT ALMOST THRILLED THAT CALLOUS CHRISTIAN
AND THE IDEA OF THIS WHITE SENTINEL OUTSIDE HER DOOR EXCITED HER SO UNPLEASANTLY THAT SHE OPENED IT BUT FOUND NO TAMAR THERE
I WILL NOT DRINK TEA NOR GO IN
THE HOUR WAS DULL WITHOUT LITTLE FAIRY
AND POOR WILLIAM WYLDER LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM WITH WHITE FACE AND DAMP FOREHEAD WAS LISTENING STUNNED AND HARDLY UNDERSTANDING A WORD HE SAID AND ONLY THE DREADFUL QUESTIONS RISING TO HIS MOUTH CAN ANYTHING BE DONE
I DON'T LIKE YOUR TALKING IN THIS STRAIN WHEN YOU KNOW IT IS TOO LATE TO RECEDE
THE ATTORNEY ROSE WITH A GAUNT AND SAD SMILE OF WELCOME--BEGGED MR WYLDER WITH A WAVE OF HIS LONG HAND TO BE SEATED--AND THEN SEATING HIMSELF AND CROSSING ONE LONG THIGH OVER THE OTHER HE THREW HIS ARM OVER THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR AND LEANING BACK WITH WHAT HE CONCEIVED TO BE A GRACEFUL AND GENTLEMANLY NEGLIGENCE--WITH HIS VISITOR FULL IN THE LIGHT OF THE WINDOW AND HIS OWN COUNTENANCE IN SHADOW THE LIGHT COMING FROM BEHIND--A DIPLOMATIC ARRANGEMENT WHICH HE AFFECTED--HE FIXED HIS SMALL PINK EYES OBSERVANTLY UPON HIM AND ASKED IF HE COULD DO ANYTHING FOR MR WILLIAM WYLDER
THEN AM I TO UNDERSTAND IN CONCLUSION SAID THE ATTORNEY THAT DEFYING ALL CONSEQUENCES THE REV
WHAT A DEEP GENTLEMAN WAS THAT STANLEY LAKE WHO SAT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE WITH THE TIMES BEFORE HIM
IN DUE TIME THE BROUGHAM CAME ROUND WITH ITS LAMPS LIGHTED AND MARK WHO WAS BY THIS TIME PLACID GREETED PRICE ON THE BOX FAMILIARLY AFTER HIS WONT AND ASKED HIM WHOM HE WAS GOING TO DRIVE AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW CUNNING FELLOW
HE HIMSELF RESUMING HIS EASY POSE UPON HIS CHAIR WITH HIS BACK AS MUCH AS WAS PRACTICABLE PRESENTED TO THE CANDLES AND THE LONG BONY FINGERS OF THE ARM WHICH RESTED ON THE TABLE NEGLIGENTLY SHADING HIS OBSERVING LITTLE EYES AND SCREENING OFF THE SIDE LIGHT FROM HIS EXPRESSIVE FEATURES
THERE WERE SCANDALOUS STORIES OF WICKED OLD TIBERIUS--BANKRUPT DEAD AND BURIED--COMPROMISING THE FAME OF TAMAR--NOT ALWAYS A SPECTACLED AND CADAVEROUS STUDENT OF HOLY WRIT
LARKIN ESQ WHO ATTENDED SO MANY SERVICES AND SERMONS ON SUNDAYS AND LED A LIFE OF SUCH ASCETIC PROPRIETY
BUT CAPTAIN BRANDON LAKE THERE IS NOTHING LIKE BEING COMPLETELY ABOVE-BOARD--IT HAS BEEN MY RULE THROUGH LIFE
THOUGH IF YOU BE I CAN'T HELP IT FOR I MUST SPEAK
A RUINED MAN WITH A PISTOL TO MY HEAD
I WAS JUST THINKING DEAR RADIE HE SAID IN HIS SWEET LOW TONES WHICH TO HER EAR ALWAYS BORE A SUSPICION OF MOCKERY IN THEM HOW PRETTY YOU CONTRIVE TO MAKE THIS BRIGHT LITTLE GARDEN AT ALL TIMES OF THE YEAR--YOU HAVE SUCH LOTS OF THOSE EVERGREENS AND IVY AND THOSE ODD FLOWERS THEY CALL THEM IMMORTELLES IN FRANCE SAID RACHEL IN A COLD STRANGE TONE AND MAKE CHAPLETS OF THEM TO LAY UPON THE COFFIN-LIDS AND THE GRAVES AH YES TO BE SURE I HAVE SEEN THEM THERE AND IN PERE LA CHAISE--SO THEY DO
SHE HATED THAT LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM IN HER PRESENT MOOD--ITS ASSOCIATIONS WERE ODIOUS AND EVEN GHASTLY
CAPTAIN BRANDON LAKE WAS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AT HEAD QUARTERS IN THESE CRITICAL TIMES
THERE IS NOT A BEAUTIFUL PORTRAIT IN BRANDON THAT HAS NOT A SAD AND TRUE STORY
THERE HE WAS TALKING TO OLD LADY CHELFORD
REALLY RADIE YOU'RE QUITE MISTAKEN
I MUST ALLOW THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY UNPLEASANT ABOUT THAT WORTHY OLD WOMAN
HE WAS SEEN I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE A DAY OR TWO BEFORE MY ARRIVAL HERE AT A LOW PLACE CALLED THE MILLER'S HALL IN THE CITY WHERE MEMBERS OF THE FANCY RESORT AT ONE OF THEIR ORGIES BUT NOT SINCE
SMITH KNEW WHAT FAIRLY MEANT AND HIS ENTRIES WENT DOWN ACCORDINGLY
IF STANLEY DIES DORCAS SIR HARRY BRACTON SHALL HEAR OF IT
NO REASON SAID DORCAS SLOWLY
I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT SINCE OF THOSE WORDS AND THEY HAVE BEGUN FOR ME TO TAKE THE SPIRIT OF A PROPHECY--SOMETIMES THAT IS--BUT AT OTHERS THEY SOUND DIFFERENTLY--LIKE A DREADFUL MENACE--AS IF MY AFFLICTIONS WERE ONLY TO BRING ME TO THE GATE OF LIFE TO FIND IT SHUT KNOCK AND IT SHALL BE OPENED SAID THE VICAR
I CAN'T SEE IT ANY MORE THAN WHAT HURRY CAN POSSIBLY EXIST ABOUT IT SAID LAKE STUNG WITH A MOMENTARY FURY
THERE HASN'T BEEN A ROBBERY IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I BELIEVE FOR EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS
AND INDEED IT IS VERY LIKELY AFTER ALL THAT HE REALLY WENT ABOUT THE JEWELS
MY INVITATIONS I FEAR WERE OBTAINED IF NOT UNDER FALSE PRETENCES AT LEAST UPON FALSE ESTIMATES AND THE LAITY RATED MY LEGAL LORE TOO HIGHLY
THERE'S NO DOUBT WHATEVER--THIS IS THE LETTER REFERRED TO IN THE LAST--WEALDON MARTIN AND THE 150_L AND THE ATTORNEY TOOK OUT HIS KEYS LOOKING PALE AND STERN LIKE A MAN ABOUT TO OPEN THE DOOR UPON A HORROR AND UNLOCKED HIS SAFE AND TOOK OUT THE OFT-CONSULTED AND FAMILIAR SERIES--LETTERS TIED UP AND BEARING THE LABEL MARK WYLDER ESQ AYE HERE IT IS GENOA 20TH AND THIS VENICE 28TH
THE BLUE SHADOWS OF TWILIGHT OVERCAST THE LANDSCAPE AND THE MISTS OF NIGHT WERE ALREADY STEALING LIKE THIN SMOKE AMONG THE TRUNKS AND ROOTS OF THE TREES
AND--AND I THINK I DO TRUST YOU RADIE SAID THE HEIRESS OF BRANDON
WHEN THE CLAY WITH WHICH IT WAS CLOTTED WAS A LITTLE REMOVED IT BECAME INDUBITABLE
SO STANLEY LAKE WALKED UP THE LITTLE AISLE TOWARD THE COMMUNION TABLE THINKING AND TOOK HOLD OF THE RAILING THAT SURROUNDED THE BRASS MONUMENT OF SIR WILLIAM DE BRAUNDON AND SEEMED TO GAZE INTENTLY ON THE EFFIGY BUT WAS REALLY THINKING PROFOUNDLY OF OTHER MATTERS AND ONCE OR TWICE HIS SLY SIDELONG GLANCE STOLE OMINOUSLY TO JOS
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER RACHEL LAKE WILL EVER MARRY
HE WAS IN A RIGHTEOUS AND DIGNIFIED WAY PLEASED TO PRESENT HIMSELF IN SO BECOMING A COSTUME AND MOREOVER IN GOOD COMPANY FOR STANLEY LAKE WAS GOING WITH HIM TO DUTTON FOR A DAY'S SPORT WHICH NEITHER OF THEM CARED FOR
I DO HOPE YOU WILL COME
THAT'S NO TRADITION OF THE BRANDONS SAID MISS DORCAS QUIETLY
BUGGS AND THE BILIOUS YOUNGSTER ENTERED WITH THE DEED AND THE ARTICLES WERE DULY EXECUTED AND THE VICAR SIGNED ALSO A RECEIPT FOR THE FANCIFUL PART OF THE CONSIDERATION AND UPON IT AND THE DEED HE ENDORSED A SOLEMN PROMISE IN THE TERMS I HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT HE WOULD NEVER TAKE ANY STEP TO QUESTION SET ASIDE OR DISTURB THE PURCHASE OR ANY MATTER CONNECTED THEREWITH
I FOUND IN MY LODGINGS IN LONDON ON MY RETURN FROM DONCASTER SOME TWO MONTHS LATER A COPY OF THE COUNTY PAPER OF THIS DATE WITH A CROSS SCRAWLED BESIDE THE PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH FOLLOWS
HERE THEN WAS A FACT ESTABLISHED
BUT THAT WERE TO ME MORE ENDURABLE THAN FRIENDSHIP GAINED ON FALSE PRETENCES
BESIDES I'M PRESSED FOR TIME AND CAN'T STAY NOW TO LISTEN THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE THIS MASTER STANLEY
AND WHEN THE DOWAGER OPENED HER FIRE ON RACHEL THE YOUNG LADY REPLIED WITH A SPIRIT AND DIGNITY TO WHICH SHE WAS NOT AT ALL ACCUSTOMED
HEAVEN KNOWS WHEN I CONSENTED TO THAT JOURNEY I DID NOT COMPREHEND ITS FULL PURPOSE THOUGH I KNEW ENOUGH TO HAVE WARNED ME OF MY DANGER AND UNDERTOOK IT IN GREAT FEAR AND ANGUISH OF MIND
WHAT SORT OF BEINGS MUST THOSE BE WHO HATE IT
BENEATH IN BLACK LETTER IS INSCRIBED THE TEXT PRINCEPS INDUETUR MAERORE ET QUIESCERE FACIAM SUPERBIAM POTENTIUM_'--AND GIGANTIC DEATH LAYS HIS FINGERS ON THE GREAT MAN'S ERMINE TIPPET
THINK OF YOUR LITTLE BOY--THINK OF DOLLY--IF YOU WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM HER BUT SAID DOLLY MR LARKIN HEARD FROM CAPTAIN LAKE THAT MARK IS PRIVATELY MARRIED AND ACTUALLY HAS HE SAYS A LARGE FAMILY
I WISH I HAD NOT BEEN LED INTO IT I DON'T THINK I'D MAKE A GOOD HUSBAND TO ANY WOMAN I DID NOT FANCY AND WHERE'S THE GOOD OF MAKING A GIRL UNHAPPY EH TUT WYLDER YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THOUGHT OF ALL THAT BEFORE
THEN WITH HIS WILD GAZE HE FOLLOWED THE LINE OF HIS ADVERSARY'S RETREAT AND SHOOK HIS EARS SLIGHTLY LIKE A MAN AT WHOSE HAIR A WASP HAS BUZZED
THE PAIN IS SUSPENDED AND THE SYSTEM RECRUITS ITSELF TO ENDURE THE COMING PAROXYSM
LARKIN ESQ DELIVERED THIS PERORATION FROM A MORAL ELEVATION ALL THE LOFTIER THAT HE HAD A PEER OF THE REALM ON HIS SIDE
HE HAS SOME SENSE AND CAUTION HAS NOT HE?--BUT SIR HARRY IS WICKEDNESS ITSELF WHY--WHAT HAS SIR HARRY DONE
BUT DON'T CRY TILL I'VE DONE SAID LAKE TRANQUILLY
I'LL BE BACK IMMEDIATELY
BUT THE SQUARE FORM AND BLACK WHISKERS OF THE PRODIGAL SON WERE NOT DISCERNIBLE THERE
MR WYLDER HAD NOT BEEN THERE FOR NINE WEEKS AND THREE DAYS
THE DEEDS WITH THEIR BLUE AND SILVER STAMPS WERE HANDSOMELY ENGROSSED--HAVING BEEN APPROVED IN DRAFT BY CROMPTON S
THE FIGURE WAS ONCE MORE A MERE MOUNTAIN OF RUG
HE HAS LEFT THE ARMY TAMAR AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS PLANS ARE AH
IN HASTE YOURS TRULY M
AND HOW HAVE YOU BEEN RADIE OH VERY WELL
BUT THOUGH HIS ACCENTS WERE ENGAGING AND HE SMILED--OF COURSE A SABBATH-DAY SMILE--YET CAPTAIN LAKE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NOT THE DOVE'S BUT THE RAT'S EYES THAT WERE DOING DUTY UNDER THAT TALL BALD BROW
BUT WISHING IS VAIN AH
IT WAS ALL A BLUNDERING CHIMERA
AS HE GAZED HOWEVER IT WAS GONE
IT SHALL BE LIFE
THEN HE TOOK ANOTHER TURN AND STOPPED AGAIN AND THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND GAZED FOR A WHILE ON THE CEILING AND THEN HE STOOD FOR A TIME AT THE WINDOW WITH HIS LIP BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB
THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINS WHY MARK WYLDER ABSCONDED
WHAT OF THAT--WE MUST REMEMBER WHO WE ARE--_GENTLEMEN_--AND ANSWER THIS SORT OF SHABBINESS AND EVERY OTHER ENDURABLE ANNOYANCE AS LORD CHESTERFIELD DID--WITH A BOW AND A SMILE
HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD DO IT PRETTY QUICKLY
AND HE LEFT THEM TOGETHER TALKING AND CRYING AND HE LOCKED HISSELF INTO THE LIBRARY LIKE ONE AS KNOWED HE'D DONE SOMETHING TO BE ASHAMED ON HALF THE NIGHT IT'S NOT HAPPY LARCOM I'M MUCH AFRAID
BUT WHICH IS NOW COMPLETE AND WILL I HOPE EVENTUALLY REPAY ME WERE YOU OF AGE MY DEAR SIR WHEN HE GAVE YOU THESE BOOKS ON CREDIT
HE ALWAYS THOUGHT EVERYONE MIGHT BE LYING
SO TAKING HEART OF GRACE HE MARCHED ON STILL ZEALOUSLY PEERING AMONG THE TREES UNTIL COMING TO AN OPENING IN THE PATHWAY HE MORE DISTINCTLY SAW A TALL WHITE FIGURE STANDING IN AN APE-LIKE ATTITUDE WITH ITS ARMS EXTENDED GRASPING TWO BOUGHS AND STOOPING AS IF PEEPING CAUTIOUSLY AS HE APPROACHED
THERE WAS SOMETHING I THINK GRIM AND SPECTRAL IN THIS CEREMONIOUS ASCENT TO THE EMPTY CHAMBER
A DEVIL IN A FAMILY NOW AND THEN IS NOT SUCH A BAD THING WHEN THERE'S WORK FOR HIM ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LAKE THEY SAY HE KILLED HIS SON A BLACKGUARD WHO WAS FOUND SHOT WITH HIS FACE IN THE TARN IN THE PARK
I HAD MADE UP MY MIND WHEN I SAW YOU FIRST AND I'LL CARRY MY POINT
AND WYLDER WAS MISSED THOUGH SOOTH TO SAY NOT VERY MUCH REGRETTED
THIS PLACE I SUPPOSE IS CONFOUNDEDLY SLOW IS NOT IT
AND I DO ASSURE YOU THOUGH WE HAD NEVER LIKED ONE ANOTHER I REALLY WAS VERY GLAD THEY DID NOT MOVE HIS EXPULSION--WHICH WOULD HAVE INVOLVED HIS QUITTING THE SERVICE--AND I POSITIVELY DON'T KNOW HOW HE COULD HAVE LIVED IF THAT HAD OCCURRED I DO SOLEMNLY ASSURE YOU CAPTAIN LAKE WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME HAS BEYOND EXPRESSION AMAZED AND I WILL SAY HORRIFIED ME SAID THE ATTORNEY WITH A SLOW AND MELANCHOLY VEHEMENCE
HE COULD NOT TELL WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON IN THE DARK
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS INTO WHICH A GOOD DEAL OF TALK IS FITTED AND WHICH SEEM SOMEWHAT OF THE LONGEST TO THOSE WHO AWAIT ITS EXPIRATION
WELL NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK--THAT GOOD MAN MR LARKIN JUST AS THINGS WERE AT THE WORST FOUND A WAY TO MAKE EVERYTHING--OH BLESSED MERCY!--THE HAND OF HEAVEN MY DEAR--QUITE RIGHT AGAIN--AND WE'LL BE SO HAPPY
LITTLE MAN'S FRUGAL STORE OF TOYS CHIEFLY THE GIFTS OF PLEASANT RACHEL WILD BEASTS NOAH AND HIS SONS AND PART OF A REGIMENT OF FOOT SOLDIERS WITH THE USUAL RETURN OF BROKEN LEGS AND MISSING ARMS STOOD PEACEFULLY MINGLED UPON THE BOARD ACROSS HIS BED WHICH SERVED AS A PLATFORM
SO THE STORY WAS SOON TOLD
BUT AFTER ALL IT WAS ONLY RIGHT FOR IT OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE BEEN HIS AT ALL
LARKIN SMILING AFTER HIS SORT EXCUSED HIMSELF
HE WAS A VERY HONEST FELLOW AND ATTACHED AND A CLEVER FELLOW TOO MY FATHER THOUGHT
BUT YOU FORGET THAT YOUR BROTHER COULD NOT HAVE RETURNED SO SOON RETURNED SAID RACHEL
SHE HAS BEEN VERY RUDE TO ME TO-NIGHT
WELL I'M HAPPY TO TELL YOU--BUT PRAY TAKE A CHAIR--THAT I HAVE SUCCEEDED AND THE DIRECTORS HAVE ALLOTTED YOU FIVE SHARES
COMPARATIVELY INDEED SHE WAS
BUT IT SEEMS YOU DON'T VERY MUCH MIND THAT HE KNEW THAT MR LARKIN DID VERY MUCH MIND IT
THIS PHENOMENON EXCITED THE PROFOUNDEST INTEREST IN THE CORRESPONDING FRIEND OF THE FAMILY WHO FUMBLING HIS LETTER BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB IN HIS BREECHES POCKET STANDING ON TIP-TOE WITH MOUTH AGAPE AND HIS HEAD AGAINST THE SHUTTER FOLLOWED THE RECEDING FIGURE WITH A GREEDY STARE
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SAFE TO TRAMPLE UPON THEM
I THINK IF SHE HAD LISTENED TO ME WITH EVEN THE FAINTEST INTIMATION OF CARING WHETHER I SPOKE IN THIS TONE OR NOT WITH EVEN A FLASH OF MOMENTARY RESENTMENT I MIGHT HAVE RUSHED INTO A MOST REPREHENSIBLE AND RIDICULOUS RIGMAROLE
I HAVE LONG CEASED THEN TO WONDER WHY ANY LIVING SOUL DOES ANYTHING THAT IS INCONGRUOUS AND UNANTICIPATED
HE WAS SOBER AS A JUDGE ALL THE MORNING AND PROCEEDED STRICTLY ON THE PRINCIPLE OF BUSINESS FIRST AND PLEASURE AFTERWARD
MY BUSINESS WILL DETAIN ME HERE I RATHER THINK THREE DAYS LONGER BY RETURN OF POST LORD CHELFORD WROTE TO STANLEY LAKE I AM SO VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR ALL THE TROUBLE YOU HAVE TAKEN
AND THOUGH THE SUN DOES NOT VERY OFTEN GLIMMER ON ITS WINDOWS IT YET POSSESSES AN AIR OF SAD OLD-WORLD COMFORT--A LITTLE FLOWER-GARDEN LIES IN FRONT WITH A PALING ROUND IT
BUT THE FACT IS I DON'T SEE MY WAY OUT OF MY PRESENT BUSINESS'--(THIS LAST WORD WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR ANOTHER CROSSED OUT WHICH LOOKED LIKE SCRAPE')--'FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS MAYBE
TWILIGHT WAS DARKER IN REDMAN'S DELL THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
THE TOWN CLERK KNEW THE CONSTITUENCY OF DOLLINGTON AT HIS FINGERS ENDS
I HAVE NOT FIRED A GUN YET AND THEY LITTLE THINK WHAT A RAKING BROADSIDE I'LL GIVE THEM
HOW VERY MAGNIFICENT
DOCTOR BUDDLE HAD BEEN SIX MILES AWAY THAT EVENING WITH A PATIENT AND LOOKED IN AT THE VICAR'S LONG AFTER THE CANDLES WERE LIGHTED
LORD CHELFORD THREW AWAY HIS STUMP TENDERED HIS CASE AGAIN TO MR LARKIN AND THEN TOOK HIS LEAVE WALKING SLOWLY HOMEWARDS
IF I'M TO CONDUCT HIS BUSINESS I OUGHT TO KNOW IT
I WISH I COULD
I TELL YOU AGAIN I AM CONVINCED THE ATTORNEY BELIEVES IT
IT STRUCK ME ON THE FIRST PERUSAL ANSWERED THE ATTORNEY
STRANGE TO SAY LAKE WAS CONSCIOUS AND IN A FEW SECONDS HE SAID IN REPLY TO THE HORRIFIED QUESTIONS OF HIS FRIEND I'M ALL SMASHED
I DON'T KNOW CAPTAIN LAKE THAT I WOULD BE QUITE JUSTIFIED IN WITHHOLDING THE SUBSTANCE OF SIR JULIUS HOCKLEY'S LETTER FROM LORD CHELFORD CONSULTED AS I HAVE HAD THE HONOUR TO BE BY THAT NOBLEMAN
GOOD-BYE GOD BLESS YOU RACHEL AND HE HURRIEDLY KISSED THE HAND SHE HAD PLACED IN HIS AND WITHOUT A WORD MORE OR LOOKING BACK HE WALKED SWIFTLY DOWN THE WOODED ROAD TOWARDS GYLINGDEN
IT HAD THINNED MY SIMPLE FRIEND'S HAIR A LITTLE AND HIS FACE TOO WAS MORE CAREWORN THAN I LIKED BUT HIS EARNEST SWEET SMILE WAS THERE STILL
IT IS SO LIKE YOU I HAVE SAID HOW VERY KIND I THOUGHT IT OF DORCAS TO PROPOSE IT
IT BELONGS TO WOMEN OF OUR BLOOD
THE CAPTAIN TOOK IT WITH A LITTLE NOD AND A PEEVISH SIDE-GLANCE
AND NOW WITH DILATED EYES AND WHITE FACE SHE WALKED NOISELESSLY INTO THE KITCHEN LISTENED THERE FOR A MOMENT THEN STOLE LIGHTLY TO THE SERVANTS SLEEPING-ROOM AND LISTENED THERE AT THE DOOR AND LASTLY LOOKED IN AND SATISFIED HERSELF THAT BOTH WERE STILL SLEEPING
HE HAD FOUND TIME FOR A VISIT TO THE KING-AT-ARMS AND THE HERALDS OFFICE
YES THE MUSIC WAS VERY PRETTY AND SOME OF THE SONGS WERE QUITE CHARMINGLY SUNG
SHE DOES NOT SAY SHE KNOWS IT BUT ONLY THAT SHE SUSPECTS THEY ARE IN A GREAT FIX ABOUT MONEY WELL YOU MUST KNOW THAT I WAS THE SOLE CAUSE OF MARK WYLDER'S LEAVING THE COUNTRY YOU STANLEY YES I DORKIE
THE CAPTAIN'S STEP CAME LIGHTLY TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS AND PAUSED
HAVING AGAIN ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO HIS JOURNEY HE WAS NOW APPROACHING THAT PART OF THE PATH WHERE THE TREES RECEDE A LITTLE LEAVING A CONSIDERABLE SPACE UNOCCUPIED AT EITHER SIDE OF HIS LINE OF MARCH
HE'S A GOOD-NATURED LITTLE CREATURE--POOR OLD BUDDLE--AND I AM CERTAIN IF IT CAN SAFELY BE HE WON'T PREVENT IT WHERE IS HE DARLING--WHERE IS STANLEY SO DORCAS DESCRIBED AS WELL AS SHE COULD
I SAY THERE'S BEEN FOUL PLAY
IT WAS A SAD AND BITTER SMILE AND SEEMED TO ASK WHITHER HAS THAT DESPERATE LOVE IN SO SHORT A TIME FLOWN
AND HER LITTLE HANDMAID OF UP IN THE SEAT BEHIND
HE WAS AFRAID TO REMOVE HIS ARM FROM DORCAS AND HE WAS SPLASHING WATER FROM A GLASS UPON HER FACE AND FOREHEAD
I HAVE ACTED CAPTAIN LAKE WITH FIDELITY IN ALL RESPECTS TO YOU AND TO EVERY CLIENT FOR WHOM I'VE BEEN CONCERNED
THERE IS GOING TO BE AN ELECTION FOR THE COUNTY AND--ONLY THINK--HE INTENDS COMING FORWARD
HIS HEAD BESIDE WAS FULL OF AMAZING CONJECTURES
WITH THESE HIS OPPORTUNITIES WERE IMMENSE
A DUSKY GLOW FROM THE WEST STILL FAINTLY SHOWED HANS HOLBEIN'S PROUD ELECTOR IN THE BRANDON WINDOW FADING WITH DEATH HIMSELF AND THE DREAD INSCRIPTION PRINCEPS INDUETUR MAERORE INTO UTTER DARKNESS
I AM GOING TO TELL YOU RACHEL WHAT I HAVE RESOLVED ON HOW REALLY BEAUTIFUL THESE DIAMONDS ARE!--QUITE SUPERB YES SAID DORCAS OPENING THE JEWEL-CASES WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN FROM HER CABINET ONE AFTER THE OTHER
AS HE APPROACHED THIS SOME ONE SAID CLOSE IN HIS EAR I BEG YOUR PARDON MASTER STANLEY HE COWERED DOWN WITH A SPRING AS I CAN FANCY A MAN DUCKING UNDER A ROUND-SHOT AND GLANCED SPEECHLESSLY AND STILL IN HIS ATTITUDE OF RECOIL UPON THE SPEAKER
HE FELT HIS POWERS FORSAKING HIM
IN A FORTNIGHT MORE HE HAD GROWN QUITE LIKE HIMSELF AGAIN
I DID NOT QUITE SEE YOUR MEANING
WAS LORD CHELFORD COMING HIS LORDSHIP HAD LEFT THE ROOM WHEN SHE RETURNED AND MR LARCOM SAID HE WAS WITH LAWYER LARKIN IN THE LIBRARY MR LARKIN CAN WAIT
THE OLD FLAME BLAZED UP WILDLY AND THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS MORE IN LOVE THEN AND FOR SOME WEEKS AFTER THE BALL THAN PERHAPS HE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
HIS MOTHER WAS A BRANDON--A SECOND COUSIN OF DORCAS'S--NO OF HER FATHER'S--I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW
IT IS SOMETIMES A LONG GAME
AND ALTHOUGH HE DOES NOT OFFER ITS FULL VALUE STILL I SHOULD SLEEP SOUNDER IF IT WERE CONCLUDED
YOU COULD NOT MEAN WHAT YOU SEEMED TO SAY
YOU MUST NOT ACT PRECIPITATELY AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MERE PIQUE
BUT SOMETHING ASSURES ME I AM RESCUED AND SHALL HAVE A QUIET MIND ONCE MORE--I AM NOW IN SAFE AND ABLE HANDS AND HE SHOOK THE SAFE AND ABLE AND RATHER LARGE HANDS OF THE AMIABLE ATTORNEY IN BOTH HIS
HE'S IN THE TOWN I KNOW
DEATH AND SLEEP SO WELCOME
THEY HAD BEEN AN ILL-CONDITIONED AND NOT A HAPPY RACE
IN REDMAN'S DELL
HE'S WONDERFULLY RESERVED
I COME BY REASON OF WHAT I READ IN THE CHRONICLE OVER NIGHT ABOUT MR MARK WYLDER BEING FOUND DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF HIM ASKED THE CORONER
IT WAS ONLY TWENTY STEPS FURTHER ON AND THE WOODS RECEDED ROUND IT SO AS TO LEAVE AN IRREGULAR AMPHITHEATRE OF SOME SIXTY YARDS ACROSS
BUT SPEAK LOW PLEASE IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING UNPLEASANT TO SAY TAMAR LAID HER HAND UPON HIS ARM AGAIN
I THINK I'LL TURN ALSO AND GO HOME THAT WAY NOTHING WOULD GIVE ME GREATER PLEASURE SAID THE VICAR TRULY AS WELL AS KINDLY FOR HE HAD GROWN INTERESTED IN THEIR CONVERSATION
AND THOUGH IT IS NOT OF SO MUCH CONSEQUENCE STILL I THINK I SHOULD NOT HAVE TOLD YOU
I WISH ALMOST SHE WAS NOT HERE AT ALL OR I WISH SHE WAS IN DORCAS'S SHOES NONSENSE WYLDER
HERE IT IS SAID WILLIAM WYLDER EAGERLY AND HE GAZED WITH HIS KIND TRUTHFUL EYES UPON THE ATTORNEY'S COUNTENANCE AS HE GLANCED OVER IT TRYING TO READ SOMETHING OF FUTURITY THEREIN
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
AND DOUBTLESS SO THEY ARE AND WERE AND EVER WILL BE UNTIL THE TIME-HONOURED MACHINERY OF OUR ELECTION SYSTEM HAS BEEN OVERHAULED AND ADAPTED TO THE CIVILISATION OF THESE DAYS
I OWN TO THAT PREJUDICE
AND SHADE AFTER SHADE WAS SPREADING SOLEMNLY OVER THE LANDSCAPE AND HAVING A GOOD WAY TO WALK I BEGAN TO STRIDE BRISKLY ALONG THE SLOPES AND HOLLOWS IN THE TWILIGHT NOW AND THEN LOOKING INTO VACANCY OVER MY SHOULDER
HIS FACE IS SO BURNT HE'S ALL EYES AND MOUTH AND ON ONE HAND HAS ONLY ONE FINGER AND HE TICKLES ME WITH IT TILL I ALMOST GIVE UP THE GHOST
I DO NOT THINK HE IS A YEAR OLDER THAN I BUT TAKES AIRS BECAUSE HE'S A TRUSTEE
BUT MISS BRANDON MADE HIM ONE OF HER GRAVEST AND SLIGHTEST BOWS AND SUDDENLY SAW MRS BROWN AT HER SHOP DOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE AND HAD A WORD TO SAY TO HER
WHEN THE VICAR I DARE SAY IN A VERY ODD QUAINT WAY MADE HIS PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE MOVED THERETO ASSUREDLY NEITHER BY FORTUNE NOR BY BEAUTY TO GOOD MERRY LITTLE MISS DOROTHY CHUBLEY WHOM NOBODY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AFTER AND THE TOWN HAD SOMEHOW SET DOWN FROM THE FIRST AS A NATURAL-BORN OLD MAID--THERE WAS A VERY GENERAL AMAZEMENT
I'M A BRANDON MYSELF DORCAS SO I'VE A RIGHT TO SPEAK
HE HAD MADE AWAY WITH HIS CHILDREN'S MONEY OR SQUANDERED HIS OWN
HE STOLE AWAY FROM MR LARKIN'S TRELLISED PORCH IN THE DUSK
DID YOU SEE BUDDLE JUST NOW NO NOT SINCE MORNING HE SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED--BAD OPINION--UNLESS HE HAS A LAW OBJECT--THOSE D--D DOCTORS--NEVER CAN KNOW
MARK WYLDER I EXCLAIMED A GOOD DEAL RELIEVED
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT AS TO A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE
HOW MANY BEAUTIFUL RUINS THAT PICTURESQUE OLD FELLOW CROMWELL HAS LEFT US YOU DON'T EAT YOUR BREAKFAST THOUGH SAID THE ATTORNEY WITH A CHARMING SMILE OF REPROACH
UPON MY HONOUR I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING OF THE ROUE IN ME
THAT LETTER OF ATTORNEY OR WHATEVER IT IS MUST NOT BE ACTED UPON
THEY WERE ALL THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WHO SACRIFICED THEMSELVES SO--THEY WERE ALL UNHAPPY MARRIAGES
NO--NO
HIS SELFISHNESS WOULD EXPAND NOBLY AND RISE ABOVE HIS PRUDENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DROWN THEM SOMETIMES
ALLOW ME--PRAY DO AND HE TOOK HER LITTLE BAG FROM HER HAND
BUT RACHEL WAS A BRAVE LASS AND RALLIED QUICKLY
NOT STIFF OR PRUDISH INDEED BUT FRANK AND COLD ENOUGH WITH HIM AND THAT WAS COMFORTING
THOMAS JONES AND ME WENT OVER IT LAST SEPTEMBER AND IT OUGHT TO BRING NEAR 3,000_L
JONES BRING MISS LAKE'S CLOAK AND BONNET HERE
IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE MAD AND WOULD MAKE A CAPITAL FARCE
THIS IS THE LETTER--AYE THIS IS THE LETTER HE REPEATED THIS FROM TIME TO TIME AS HE TURNED IT OVER AND LOOKED AT THE POSTMARK AND BACK AGAIN AT THE LETTER AND LOOKED UP AT THE DATE AND DOWN AT THE SIGNATURE AND READ THE NOTE THROUGH
IT WOULD COST MY YOUNG MISTRESS HER LIFE
YOU HAVE FORMED YOUR PLAN WHATEVER IT IS AND THAT PLAN YOU WILL FOLLOW AND NO OTHER THOUGH MEN AND ANGELS WERE UNITED TO DISSUADE YOU THERE WAS A PAUSE HERE AND A SILENCE FOR A GOOD MANY SECONDS
LARKIN WALKED OFF TO BRANDON BUT THERE HE LEARNED THAT CAPTAIN BRANDON LAKE AS HE NOW CHOSE TO CALL HIMSELF HAD GONE THAT MORNING TO LONDON
THEY USED TO STAND ON THE LITTLE MARBLE TABLE BETWEEN THE WINDOWS OLD TAMAR HAD GLIDED IN WHILE THEY HERE TALKING AND PLACED THE LITTLE TEA EQUIPAGE ON THE TABLE UNNOTICED AND THE CAPTAIN WAS SIPPING HIS CUP OF TEA AND INSPECTING THE PATTERN WHILE HIS SISTER AMUSED HIM
IN THIS MOOD HE PACED WITHOUT MINDING IN WHAT DIRECTION HE WENT UNDER THOSE GREAT ROWS OF TIMBER WHICH OVER-ARCH THE PATHWAY LEADING TOWARD REDMAN'S DELL--THE PATH THAT HE AND MARK WYLDER HAD TROD IN THAT MISTY MOONLIGHT WALK ON WHICH I HAD SEEN THEM SET OUT TOGETHER
ONLY WITHOUT KNOWING IT YOU WERE THWARTING ME AND HELPING TO GET ME INTO A SERIOUS DIFFICULTY BY YOUR OBSTINACY--OR WHAT YOU WILL--ABOUT FIVE OAKS SOMEHOW TRIFLING AS THE MATTER WAS STANLEY SEEMED TO GROW MORE AND MORE UNWILLING TO DISCLOSE IT AND RATHER SHRANK FROM IT NOW
DO COME HERE DOROTHY SHE EXCLAIMED NOT RAISING HER EYES I HAVE FOUND THE VERY THING WHAT THING
LARKIN FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS MORE
THERE WAS BUT ONE IMPERFECT VISTA LOOKING DOWN THE GLEN AND THIS AFFORDED NO DISTANT VIEW--ONLY A DOWNWARD SLANT IN THE NEAR WOODLAND AND A DENSER BACKGROUND OF FOREST RISING AT THE OTHER SIDE AND TO-NIGHT MISTILY GILDED BY THE YELLOW MOON-BEAMS THE MOON HERSELF UNSEEN
I AM GLAD YOU ARE HERE RADIE--I HAVE GROWN SO NERVOUS--SO SUPERSTITIOUS I BELIEVE
THOUGH THAT WON'T DO--HE'S IN WYLDER'S INTEREST--CURSE HIM
D YOU WHAT THE DEVIL--DON'T BE A--FOOL AND OTHER SOOTHING EXPRESSIONS ESCAPED THIS PEACEMAKER AS HE CLUNG FAST TO THE YOUNG BARONET'S ARM
MR LARKIN CAME TO ME THE EVENING BEFORE LAST SAID RACHEL AND TOLD ME THAT THE LITTLE SUM I MENTIONED--NOW DON'T SAY A WORD TILL YOU HAVE HEARD ME--WAS NOT SUFFICIENT
THEY WERE HOWEVER SIMILARLY DECLINED IN PANTOMIME
HE LET THE ROOF ALL OUT OF REPAIR AND COMMITTED WASTE BESIDE IN TIMBER HE HAD NO RIGHT TO IN LIFE AS I AM TOLD
AND WHAT DOES HE PROPOSE DOING THEN ASKED WYLDER WITHOUT RAISING HIS EYES FROM HIS BOOK
THERE WAS IN FACT OFTEN IN THE GOOD ATTORNEY'S MODE OF TRANSACTING BUSINESS JUST A SOUPCON OR FLAVOUR OF AN ARRIERE PENSEE OF A REMOTE AND UNSEEN PLAN WHICH WAS A LITTLE UNSATISFACTORY
AND SHE FLOATED DOWN LIKE A CLOUD UPON THE OTTOMAN BESIDE OLD LADY SARAH AND SMILED AND LEANED TOWARDS HER AND TALKED IN HER SWEET LOW DISTINCT ACCENTS
THERE WAS ALSO AN ALLUSION TO CAPTAIN LAKE'S ACCIDENT--WITH THE EXPRESSION OF A HOPE THAT IT WOULD PROVE BUT A TRIFLING ONE AND AN ASSURANCE THAT HIS CANVASS WOULD NOT BE PREVENTED BY IT--ALTHOUGH FOR A FEW DAYS IT MIGHT NOT BE A PERSONAL ONE
THE CAMBRIDGE TRADESMEN WERE GROWING MINATORY
THE MORE SHE THOUGHT THE CLEARER HER CONVICTION
VERY UNPLEASANT POSSIBLY
BUT THIS YOU MAY BE SURE OF YOU WILL NEVER FIND ANYONE TO LOVE YOU BETTER RACHEL--I THINK SO WELL--AND--AND NOW--THAT IS ALL
TURNING UP THE DARK ROAD AT REDMAN'S DELL THE GALLANT CAPTAIN PASSED THE OLD MILL AND ALL BEING QUIET UP AND DOWN THE ROAD HE HALTED UNDER THE LORDLY SHADOW OF A CLUMP OF CHESTNUTS AND OPENED AND READ THE LETTER HE HAD JUST TAKEN CHARGE OF
A BEAUTIFUL SMILING LITTLE FELLOW VERY EXACTING OF ATTENTION--TROUBLESOME PERHAPS
AND THE URBANE AND CORDIAL CAPTAIN WITH ALL A CANDIDATE'S GOOD FELLOWSHIP SHOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HANDS AND HEARD THEIR STORY
IT WAS PARTLY THE MONOTONY AND THEIR OCCUPYING THE CARRIAGE ALL TO THEMSELVES--AS THE TWO UNCOMMUNICATIVE SEAMEN DID THE EDDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE--BUT THERE WAS BESIDE AN INDISTINCT FEELING THAT IN SPITE OF ALL THESE WRAPPERS AND SWATHINGS HE KNEW THE OUTLINES OF THAT FIGURE
THANK YOU DARLING
AND WE WERE ALL AMAZED AT LENGTH TO FIND HOW VERY LATE IT WAS
YOU MEAN LITTLE CAROLINE
SO I GOT THE RESURGAM YOU SEE THERE ENGRAVED ROUND IT AND BY JOVE
I NEVER MIND WHAT HE TELLS ME FOR I THINK HE LIKES TO MISLEAD EVERYBODY
WHILE RACHEL LAKE WAS AS USUAL BUSY IN HER LITTLE GARDEN THAT DAY LORD CHELFORD ON HIS WAY TO THE TOWN BY THE PRETTY MILL-ROAD TOOK OFF HIS HAT TO HER WITH A SMILING SALUTATION AND LEANING ON THE PALING HE SAID I OFTEN WONDER HOW YOU MAKE YOUR FLOWERS GROW HERE--YOU HAVE SO LITTLE SUN AMONG THE TREES--AND YET IT IS SO PRETTY AND FLOWERY
THAT ACCOUNTS FOR IT ALL
AND THE OPEN HEATH CONTRASTED PLEASANTLY WITH THE SOMBRE AND CONFINED SCENERY OF REDMAN'S DELL
DO AS YOU LIKE
I HAVE LITTLE TO RECORD OF NEXT DAY EXCEPT THAT LARKIN RECEIVED ANOTHER LONDON LETTER
I SEE
AND I DON'T THINK I EVER HEARD HIM SAY A GOOD WORD OF ANY ONE I DARE SAY HE ABUSES YOU AND ME AS HE DOES EVERYONE ELSE DOES HE I SAID
I AM FALLEN FROM LIGHT INTO DARKNESS
LAKE GLIDED FROM THE FEAST WITH A SENSE OF A TREMENDOUS LIABILITY UPON HIM
SHE WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD THEIR LITTLE CONVERSATION ENDED BEFORE ITS TIME
AN EVIL EYE LOOKS ON THE VICAR
I WAS TOO CURIOUS TO SEE THE BRIDE IN HER NEW RELATIONS AND TO OBSERVE SOMETHING OF THE CONJUGAL ADMINISTRATION OF LAKE TO ALLOW ANYTHING SERIOUSLY TO STAND IN THE WAY OF MY PROPOSED TRIP
I TELL YOU TAMAR I'M IN HASTE AND CAN'T STAY
YOU HAVE MISS RADIE'S SECRET IN YOUR HANDS I DON'T THINK YOU'D LIKE TO INJURE HER AND YOU USED TO BE TRUSTWORTHY
THEN CHANGED HER DRESS QUICKLY PUT ON HER WALKING BOOTS A CLOSE BONNET AND THICK VEIL AND TAKING HER PURSE SHE COUNTED OVER ITS CONTENTS AND THEN STANDING IN THE MIDST OF THE ROOM LOOKED ROUND IT WITH A GREAT SIGH AND A STRANGE LOOK AS IF IT WAS ALL NEW TO HER
IT DID NOT STRIKE ME BEFORE BUT DO YOU KNOW NOW IT IS LAUGHS OUT JOLLY MRS DOLLY ISN'T IT
AN UNDULATING LANDSCAPE WITH A HOMELY FARMSTEAD HERE AND THERE AND PLENTY OF OLD ENGLISH TIMBER SCATTERED GRANDLY OVER IT EXTENDED MISTILY TO MY RIGHT
HE WAS ARRANGING HE SAID ABOUT SELLING OUT OH
THERE WAS BESIDE A SCAR WHICH HOWEVER WAS NOT A VERY GLARING INCONSISTENCY ALTHOUGH IT WAS PLAINLY OF A MUCH OLDER STANDING THAN THE DATE OF MARK'S DISAPPEARANCE
AND I HAD SUCH A NICE WALK ON THE COMMON FIRST AND THEN A TURN UP AND DOWN BEFORE THE BRANDON ARMS WHERE AT LAST I READ A PAPER AND COULD NOT RESIST A GLASS OF BRANDY AND WATER AND GROWING LAZY CAME HOME IN A FLY SO I THINK I HAVE HAD A VERY GAY EVENING
PRAY COMPOSE YOURSELF MISS LAKE--THERE'S NO NEED TO AGITATE YOURSELF--NOTHING OF ALL THIS NEED OCCUR IF YOU DO NOT FORCE IT UPON ME--_NOTHING
AND LONGING TO BREAK THE SEAL HE AVAILED HIMSELF OF THE CAPTAIN'S PERMISSION
KEEP A BRIGHT LOOK OUT
COME CHARLIE YOU USED TO LIKE A BET
WILLIAM WYLDER HAD A LETTER CONTAINING THREE LINES FROM HIM AT EIGHT O'CLOCK TO WHICH HE SENT AN ANSWER WHEREUPON THE SOLICITOR DESPATCHED A SPECIAL MESSENGER ONE OF HIS CLERKS TO DOLLINGTON WITH A LETTER TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPUTY FROM WHOM HE RECEIVED DULY A REPLY WHICH NECESSITATED A SECOND LETTER WITH A FORMAL UNDERTAKING TO WHICH CAME ANOTHER REPLY
WHEN THEY REACHED THAT LONELY PATH NEAR THE FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS STANLEY DISTINCTLY THREATENED HIS COMPANION WITH A DISCLOSURE OF THE SCANDALOUS INCIDENT IN THE CARD-ROOM OF THE CLUB WHICH HE AFTERWARDS RELATED SUBSTANTIALLY AS IT HAD HAPPENED TO JOS
ALWAYS QUIETLY LIKE A LITTLE GENTLEMAN BUT OH
I HOPE DORCAS YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME
A PRETTY FOREIGN TONGUE SPOKEN ROUND US AND NO ONE BUT OURSELVES TO COMMUNE WITH AND BOOKS AND MUSIC
D HIM THAT FORGED IT
EVERY FOOL KNOWS THE WYLDERS ARE GENTLEMEN--ALL GENTLEMEN IN MISFORTUNE
YOU'RE A HEROINE RADIE
CAN YOU TELL BY THE SKY WHEN IT IS HOLIDAY IN HELL
DID YOU SEE THAT SAID WYLDER IN MY EAR WITH A CHUCKLE
MR WYLDER WILL APPLY TO A COURT OF EQUITY TO ARREST THEIR PROCEEDINGS
I DON'T SEE THAT I AM A WORSE BROTHER THAN YOU ARE A SISTER STANLEY LAKE WAS SPEAKING WITH A LIVID INTENSITY
IS NOT THERE JUST A LITTLE SUSPICION OF FROST--DON'T YOU THINK SO--NOT ACTUALLY COLD BUT CRISP AND SHARP--UNSPEAKABLY EXHILARATING
BUT RESPECTING GOOD MR LARKIN YOU ARE INDEED IN ERROR
SO SHE HURRIED AWAY WITH A HASTY AND KIND GOOD-BYE
I KNOW WHAT BECAME OF HIM CONTINUED THE ORACLE
BUT IN RACHEL S EYES AS PICTURES WILL IT CHANGED ITS CHARACTER WITH HER OWN CHANGE OF THOUGHT AND NOW IT SEEMED THE PALE RAPT SMILE OF ONE WHO HEARS MUSIC FAR OFF OR SEES A VISION
SO RACHEL FIRST MADE HER VISIT TO LITTLE MAN SITTING UP IN HIS BED VERY PALE AND THIN AND LOOKING AT HER NOT WITH HIS PRETTY SMILE BUT A LANGUID EARNEST WONDER AND NOT SPEAKING
AND MISS DIPPLES HER MAID SHE SAYS AS HOW SHE WAS WORSE UP STAIRS AND SHE'S MADE UP AGAIN WITH MISS LAKE WHICH SHE WAS VERY GLAD NO DOUBT OF THE MAKING FRIENDS I DO SUPPOSE
THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL IN WILL HONEYCOMB FOR INSTANCE
WELL--MAYBE--YES HE IS TO BLAME--THE MISERABLE MAN--WHOM I HATE TO THINK OF AND YET AM ALWAYS THINKING OF--STANLEY WELL KNOWS IS NOT IN A STATE TO DO IT DON'T YOU THINK RACHEL REMEMBERING WHAT I HAVE CONFIDED TO YOU THAT YOU MIGHT BE FRANKER WITH ME IN THIS OH DORCAS
THAT LITTLE HELPLESS GROPING WAILING CREATURE WAS NOW THE DORCAS BRANDON THE MISTRESS OF THE GRAND OLD MANSION AND ALL ITS SURROUNDINGS WHO WAS THE HEROINE OF THE SPLENDID MATRIMONIAL COMPROMISE WHICH WAS ABOUT TO RECONCILE A FEUD AND AVERT A POSSIBLE LAWSUIT AND FOR ONE GENERATION AT LEAST TO TRANQUILLISE THE TROUBLED ANNALS OF THE BRANDONS AND WYLDERS
IT WILL LEAD I THINK TO A MUCH MORE EXACT GUESS ABOUT MR MARK WYLDER THERE WAS A STURDY EMPHASIS IN THE ATTORNEY'S SPEECH WHICH WAS FAR FROM USUAL AND INDICATED SOMETHING
AND I THINK SIR GLANCING AGAIN AT ME IT MUST STRIKE YOU A LITTLE ODDLY THAT I SHOULD BE INVITED IN YOUR PRESENCE TO DISCUSS FAMILY MATTERS WITH MISS DORCAS BRANDON NOW WAS IT FAIR TO CALL A PEACEABLE INHABITANT LIKE ME INTO THE THICK OF A FRAY LIKE THIS
AND ON THE WHOLE NOTWITHSTANDING HIS MODESTY I THOUGHT WYLDER VERY WELL ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING IT WILL OPERATE I'M AFRAID AS YOU WILL PRESENTLY SEE RATHER TO HIS PREJUDICE
THEREFORE YOU SEE MY LIBERTY AND WISHES BEING AT PRESENT INTERFERED WITH IT WOULD BE VERY HARD LINES IF POOR DORCAS SHOULD BE HELD TO HER BARGAIN
OH THE FATIGUE OF THESE MONOTONOUS AGITATIONS--THIS NEVER-ENDING SUSPENSE
AND I THINK THOUGH I HAVE LEARNED TO FEAR DEATH I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN LET STANLEY EVEN SUSPECT IT SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK OF FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH
WHAT THE DEVIL'S THAT SAID WEALDON
PERHAPS THEY BORE NO VERY DISTINCT MEANING JUST THEN TO HIS MIND
YOU'RE A LITTLE HYSTERICAL THAT'S ALL
BUT HE REALLY LOOKED WORSE
I HAD A LINE FROM MR MARK WYLDER YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AS USUAL WITHOUT ANY ADDRESS BUT THE POSTMARK AND GOOD MR LARKIN LAUGHED A MILD LITTLE PATIENT LAUGH AND LIFTED HIS OPEN HAND AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
YOU HAVE NOT TROUBLED YOURSELF A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ME YOU KNOW
AND AS I DID SO I FELT A RATHER COLD HAND REALLY RESTING ON MY THROAT AND QUIETLY PASSED UP OVER MY CHIN AND FACE
AND SO HE MOVED ON TO THE MILL-ROAD ON WHICH HE ENTERED AND WAS SOON DEEP IN THE SHADOWS OF REDMAN'S DELL
SO SHE SAT HERSELF DOWN BY THE KITCHEN FIRE AND PLACED HER PRETTY FEET--COLD NOW--UPON THE HIGH STEEL FENDER AND EXTENDED HER COLD HANDS TOWARDS THE EMBERS LEANING BACK IN HER RUDE CHAIR
AT THAT DREAD HOUR CAPTAIN LAKE ABOUT A MILE ON THE DOLLINGTON WHICH WAS THE OLD LONDON ROAD FROM GYLINGDEN WAS PACING BACKWARD AND FORWARD UNDER THE TOWERING FILES OF BEECH THAT OVERARCH IT AT THAT POINT
I SUPPOSE HE HOPES IT
BUT IT WILL COST A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY DORKIE YES I KNOW
HER CONVERSATION WAS LIVELY AND RATHER BOLD NOT AT ALL IN THE COARSE SENSE BUT SHE STRUCK ME AS HAVING FORMED A SYSTEM OF ETHICS AND VIEWS OF LIFE BOTH GOOD-HUMOURED AND SARCASTIC AND HAD CARRIED INTO HER RUSTIC SEQUESTRATION THE MELANCHOLY AND PRECOCIOUS LORE OF HER EARLY LONDON EXPERIENCE
AND AT ONCE I SAY GO ON
THERE'S A DEAD BODY PARTLY DISCLOSED DOWN THERE--SOME ONE MURDERED AND BURIED
AND I'M AFRAID NOT LISTENING TO JIM'S ANSWERS AS ATTENTIVELY AS ONE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED
AND HE AS FRANKLY APPROVED AND SAID HE WOULD ASK LARKIN THE FAMILY LAWYER TO COME UP IN THE MORNING TO ASSIST
POOR WILLIAM
I HAVE TAKEN--TO SAVE YOU--IT MAY BE ONLY A RESPITE_--ONE STEP THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHICH IS INSUPPORTABLE
POSSIBLY HE MAY NEVER KNOW AND THAT MIGHT BE BEST FOR BOTH--BUT BE IT HOW IT MAY I WILL NEVER MARRY ANYONE ELSE DORCAS DEAR YOU MUST NOT SPEAK TO LADY CHELFORD OR TO MARK WYLDER TO-NIGHT
YOU DEAR OLD WITCH HOW THE PLAGUE COULD YOU TAKE ANY SUCH FRIGHTFUL NONSENSE INTO YOUR HEAD
THEY HAD A COUPLE OF FLAGS AND SOME MUSIC
AND I'LL SAY A GREAT DEAL MORE SAID HE IN A PECULIAR ODD TONE THAT WAS VERY FIRM AND YET INDESCRIBABLY TENDER
BUT I RAYTHER THINK NOT
THE WOOD PASSED DORCAS STOPPED THE CARRIAGE AND THE TWO YOUNG LADIES DESCENDED
AND THE RENTAL WHICH HE NOW CAREFULLY CONSULTED TOLD HIM THESE JOINTLY WERE IN ROUND NUMBERS WORTH 2,300_L A YEAR AND IMPROVABLE
AT ALL EVENTS HE DID NOT STIR AND CAREFULLY ABSTAINED FROM WAKENING AND IN A FEW SECONDS MORE THEY WERE AGAIN IN MOTION
I THINK A SHOWER IS COMING AND SHE PICKED UP HER TROWEL AND OTHER IMPLEMENTS AND PLACED THEM IN THE PORCH AND GLANCED UP TOWARDS THE CLOUDS AS IF SHE SAW THEM AND HAD NOTHING TO THINK OF BUT HER GARDENING AND THE WEATHER AND AS IF HER HEART WAS NOT BREAKING
AND SURELY THAT IS NOT UNREASONABLE I HAVE LEARNED ONE SECRET AND AM EXPOSED TO ONE DANGER
HA!--_LOOK HE RESUMED POINTING WITH HIS CADAVEROUS FOREFINGER TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE POOL
WHEREUPON HE WROTE TO BURLINGTON SMITH AND CO ACQUAINTING THEM RESPECTFULLY IN DIPLOMATIC FASHION WITH THE ATTITUDE WHICH AFFAIRS HAD ASSUMED
DORCAS SHOWS HER JEWELS TO MISS LAKE
HE UNLOCKED THE IRON SAFE AND TOOK OUT THE SHEAF OF WYLDER'S LETTERS AND CONNED THE LAST ONE OVER VERY CAREFULLY
HE REGRETTED THAT HE HAD NOT AN OPPORTUNITY OF TELLING THEM SO PERSONALLY
IN THE MEANTIME HE HAS MADE A DISTINCT OFFER TO BUY FIVE OAKS
WYLDER IN FACT TIED ME DOWN BY A PROMISE AND HE'LL BE DEVILISH ANGRY WITH YOU
HERE WAS A NEW REASON FOR WISHING TO KNOW REALLY HOW MARK WYLDER STOOD
HOW HAVE I DESERVED SO WONDERFUL A BLESSING AND I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID THE ATTORNEY FONDLING THE VICAR'S ARM IN HIS LARGE HAND THAT THESE CLAIMS WILL ULTIMATELY BE REDUCED FULLY THIRTY PER CENT
HE GOT UP AT HIS LEISURE AND GREETED OLD TAMAR WITH HIS SLEEPY AMUSED SORT OF SMILE AND A FEW TRITE WORDS OF KINDNESS
NOTWITHSTANDING THE LATE WHIST PARTY OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN MADE A VERY EARLY TOILET
I REALLY DON'T KNOW--YOU PERHAPS CAN TELL ANSWERED SHE COLDLY
AND OH SUCH TRANSPORTS OF GRATITUDE BROKE FORTH WHEN HE WAS GONE
OF COURSE IT IS QUITE EASY THE BARONET WAS SMILING HIS BEST WITH A VERY RED FACE AND THAT UNPLEASANT UNCERTAINTY IN HIS CONTRACTED EYES WHICH ACCOMPANIES SUPPRESSED RAGE
AND BEG PARDON WITH PROPER HUMILITY--SUPPOSING THE MASTER IS ON THE SAME ERRAND--WHAT CAN HE SAY
THEIR FIDELITY WAS OF THE DAYS OF CHIVALRY AND THEIR SIMPLICITY COMICAL AND BEAUTIFUL
IT WAS MARK WYLDER'S PENMANSHIP--HE COULD SWEAR TO IT
FORGOT SUMMAT SIR SAID THE PORTER TOUCHING HIS HAT
AND YOU MUST PROMISE ME SOLEMNLY THAT YOU WILL NOT LISTEN TO THE ADVICE OF THAT BAD CRUEL MAN MR LARKIN MY DEAR MISS LAKE YOU MISUNDERSTOOD HIM
NO SAID MR LARKIN AGAIN I'M NOT SUSPICIOUS--NATURALLY TOO MUCH THE REVERSE I FEAR
HE SHALL BE LIKE A TREE PLANTED BY THE WATER-SIDE THAT WILL BRING FORTH HIS FRUIT IN DUE SEASON
THAT SUDDEN STAB FROM JOS
SHE'LL BE HOME IMMEDIATELY
I HAD HEARD A GREAT DEAL OF HER BEAUTY
A FEW MINUTES BROUGHT US INTO THE BLACKBERRY HOLLOW WHICH DEBOUCHES INTO REDMAN'S DELL
HE LOOKS UPON POOR LAKE AS IN VERY GREAT DANGER--BUT THAT IS ALL WHAT BRUTES YOU MEN ARE SAID DORCAS WITH A WILD SCORN IN HER LOOK AND ACCENT AND HER CHEEKS FLUSHED WITH PASSION
LET HIM DO WHAT HE WILL--I BELIEVE A LAWSUIT IS HIS WORST REVENGE--I'M INDIFFERENT JUST THEN A KNOCK CAME TO THE CHAMBER DOOR
THERE WAS A STRANGE PAIN AT HIS HEART AND THE PAIN OF INTENSE AND FRUITLESS CALCULATION IN HIS BRAIN
SO NOW HAVING TAKEN ALL MEASURES GLIDING AMONG THE PORTMANTEAUS HAND-BARROWS AND PORTERS AND THE CLANGOROUS BELL RINGING HE MOUNTED LITHE AND LANK INTO HIS PLACE
HE GREW MORE NERVOUS ABOUT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN HIM AND MARK WYLDER IN PROPORTION AS THE WORLD GREW MORE SPLENDID AND PROSPEROUS FOR HIM
WE COULD UNITE OUR INCOMES
YOU REMEMBER MY DEAR MR WYLDER THAT I DID NOT AT ALL INVITE THESE RELATIONS
AND CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU MR LARCOM SAID THE GOOD ATTORNEY WAVING HIS LONG HAND TOWARD A VACANT CHAIR
A FRACAS IN THE LIBRARY
I'LL SEE YOU A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR WAY HOME RADIE SAID STANLEY
YOU HAVE PREPARED AN AGREEABLE SURPRISE FOR HIM
BUT WE GET ROUGH WAYS IN THE ARMY I'M AFRAID AND YOU WON'T MIND ME
YOU SEE I HAVE COME BACK A LITTLE BEFORE MY TIME SAID DORCAS
IT REFERS TO THE VICAR THE REV
I HEARD NO TALKING SUCH AS COMES BETWEEN WHIFFS WITH FRIENDLY SMOKERS SIDE BY SIDE
HOW AWFUL WAS THE CHANGE
YOU'RE NOT AILING NUNKIE ARE YOU
AND SHE PUSHED OPEN THE WINDOW AND STOOD FOR A MOMENT IN THE CHILL AIR AND SIGHED AND WHISPERED A WORD OR TWO OVER THE CLOSING FLOWERS OF HER LITTLE GARDEN TOWARD THE DARKENING GLEN AND WITH ANOTHER GREAT SIGH CLOSED THE WINDOW AND RETURNED
I HAVE LOST A LOT OF MONEY LIKE A--FOOL I SUPPOSE
THEN THE THING CAN'T GO ON I CAN'T HELP IT BUT I'M RESOLVED IT SHALL ANSWERED STANLEY
LARKIN WAS NOT THERE
SO THAT MY BELOVED BROTHER JULIUS AT PRESENT AFFLICTED IN MIND LAKE QUOTED THE WORDS OF THE WILL WITH AN UNPLEASANT SNEER SHOULD HAVE HAD HIS APARTMENTS AND HIS PLEASURE GROUNDS QUITE TO HIMSELF AND WOULD THAT ARRANGEMENT OF MR WYLDER'S HAVE SATISFIED THE CONDITIONS OF THE WILL SAID THE TOWN CLERK
HAD JAMES DUTTON ARRIVED AND ANNOUNCED THE DEATH OF MARK--NO
WAS HE IN SHIVE'S COURT OR CURSED LUCK
TOO BAD TO LOSE A SECOND UNCLE AT THE SAME EARLY AGE
THE TONES OF HIS PLEASANT LITTLE VOICE IN THOSE SAD FLIGHTS OF MEMORY AND FANCY BUSY WITH FAMILIAR SCENES AND OCCUPATIONS SOUNDED WILD AND PLAINTIVE IN HIS EAR
WILL THE PEOPLE COME TO-DAY MR LARKIN EXPLAINED THE CONSTITUTIONAL RESPECT FOR THE SABBATH
THOSE HIGH FELLOWS ARE VERY KNOWING OFTEN--SO MUCH ON THE TURF AND ALL THAT--VERY SHARP AND VERY DEEP HE WAS THINKING OF A CERTAIN NOBLE LORD IN DIFFICULTIES WHO HAD HIT A CLIENT OF HIS RATHER HARD AND WHOSE AFFAIRS DID NOT REFLECT MUCH CREDIT UPON THEIR NOBLE CONDUCTOR
YOU'RE ALWAYS CALLING NAMES D YOU
I KNEW YOU'D BE BETTER AND HE PATTED HER SHOULDER WITH HIS SOFT HAND
THERE IS NOT A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN ON THE GRAND JURY WHO IS NOT YOUR SUPERIOR
HIS ILL-OMENED SMILE EXPANDED TO A GRIN THAT WAS UNDISGUISEDLY DIABOLICAL
A SULTANA RATHER--SUBLIMELY EGOTISTICAL WITHOUT REVERENCE--A VOLUPTUOUS AND HAUGHTY EMBODIMENT OF INDIFFERENCE
A FEW MINUTES LATER HER BROTHER WHO HAD BEEN BUSY DOWN STAIRS PUT HIS HEAD IN AND ASKED WILL YOU COME WITH ME NOW RADIE OR DO YOU PREFER TO WAIT HERE I'LL STAY HERE--THAT IS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
AND I HOPE YOU WILL TRY TO LIKE ME ON TILL--TILL SPRING COMES YOU KNOW
POOR DOLLY VERY TIRED HAD GONE TO LIE DOWN FOR A LITTLE
I WISH YOU'D CHANGE WITH ME AND LET ME BE COOK WEEK ABOUT
HE HAD HOWEVER PLACED THE VICAR'S LETTER IN THEIR HANDS AND HAD ACCOMPANIED IT WITH HIS OWN TESTIMONY TO THE HONOUR AND CHARACTER OF THE REV
BUT HANG IT WYLDER YOU'RE A MARRIED MAN NOW AND MUST GIVE UP TALKING THAT WAY
SO THEY SENT HIM INTO THE SMALL CARD-ROOM NEXT THAT WE WERE PLAYING IN
I'VE A GOOD GLASS AND CAN SEE PRETTY FAR AND MAKE A FAIR GUESS ENOUGH WHAT'S GOING ON ABOARD THE ENEMY
COME IN SAID THE CAPTAIN
AT THE SAME TIME THE TWO DOGS WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED US BEGAN TO BARK FURIOUSLY BENEATH IN THE RAVINE
HIS FEATURES IN PROFILE HAD SOMETHING OF A GRECIAN CHARACTER BUT HIS FACE WAS TOO BROAD--VERY BROWN RATHER A BLOODLESS BROWN--AND HE HAD A PAIR OF GREAT DENSE VULGAR BLACK WHISKERS
YES DEAR STANLEY MUCH BETTER
MARRIAGE?--WHY TIS A DIVINE INSTITUTION
I--I--YES--I HAVE--HAVE YOU AN ENGINE HERE:--EXPRESS--I'LL PAY ANYTHING BUT NO THERE WAS NO ENGINE--NOT NEARER THAN THE JUNCTION AND SHE MIGHT NOT BE SPARED HOW FAR IS THE JUNCTION NINETEEN AND A-HALF NINETEEN MILES
I THINK WE WERE ABOUT THE LAST IN THE CLUB--IT WAS PAST THREE O'CLOCK--AND SO THE OLD BOYS DELIBERATED ON THEIR SENTENCE
IN THE NIGHT TIME WE PICKED UP THREE POOR DEVILS IN AN OPEN BOAT ONE WAS A PERSIAN MERCHANT WITH A GRAND BEARD
LORD CHELFORD A MOST HONOURABLE ONE
AND YET WITHOUT HOPE FOR MYSELF DESPERATELY IN LOVE DORCAS LOOKED DOWN AND SMILED ODDLY
SHE KNEW PERHAPS IT WAS THE MEREST CHIMERA
AND OLD TAMAR LOOKED ON HER IN A SORT OF WONDER HER BEAUTY SEEMED SO CELESTIAL AND SPLENDID
CERTAINLY SHE IS AWFULLY LIKE A GHOST
I DON'T THINK THEY PRETEND TO LIKE ONE ANOTHER
LORD CHELFORD PLAINLY THOUGHT MORE THAN HE CARED TO SAY
SHE WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR THE DEAR CHILD WAS BETTER BUT THERE WAS A WEIGHT UPON HER SOUL AND A DREADFUL HORROR ON HER COUNTENANCE STILL
AND NOW HANDSOME SIR HARRY BRACTON SIX FEET HIGH SO BROAD-SHOULDERED AND SLIM-WAISTED HIS FINE BUT NOT VERY WISE FACE IRRADIATED WITH INDEFATIGABLE SMILES STOOD AND CONVERSED WITH HER WITH THAT JAUNTY SWAGGER OF HIS--HIS WEIGHT NOW ON THIS SIDE NOW ON THAT SQUARING HIS ELBOWS LIKE A CRACK WHIP WITH FOUR-IN-HAND AND WAGGING HIS PERFUMED TRESSES--BOISTEROUS ROLLICKING BEAMING WITH IMMEASURABLE SELF-COMPLACENCY
THE LITTLE WHIM HAD SOMETHING TRANQUILLISING AND BALMY
WAS THIS DOOMED HOUSE OF BRANDON NEVER TO KNOW REPOSE OR FRATERNITY
SHE SEIZED IT
THE ATTORNEY HAD TOLD HIM IT WAS A TOUCH-AND-GO AFFAIR AND THE WHOLE THING MIGHT BE OFF IN A MOMENT
AND JUST AS THE LADIES ARRIVED THAT PERSON EMERGED LOOKING OVERPOWERINGLY GENTLEMANLIKE IN A WHITE HAT GRAY PALETOT LAVENDER TROWSERS AND WHITE RIDING GLOVES
AND REALLY THE FIRE IS QUITE PLEASANT TO-NIGHT
YES HE IS--_THAT HE IS
IT IS WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER LITTLE MATTER--THE EXECUTION OF THE DEED OF CONVEYANCE TO MESSRS
YOU'LL NOT MENTION OF COURSE AND I'M ONLY FEELING MY WAY JUST NOW AND SPEAKING CONJECTURALLY ALTOGETHER
CAPTAIN LAKE SEEMED TO HAVE MOST TO SAY
AND IT IS QUITE USELESS SPEAKING TO HIM PERHAPS IF RACHEL LAKE HAD BEEN IN BELGRAVIA LEADING A TOWN LIFE THE MATTER WOULD HAVE TAKEN NO SUCH DARK COLOURING AND PORTENTOUS PROPORTIONS
I SHOULD LIKE IT SO AND THE BARONET WHO WAS I AM AFRAID WHAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD TERM PERHAPS VULGAR WINKED OVER HIS GLASS AT THE BLOOMING CONFECTIONER WHO TURNED AWAY AND TITTERED OVER HER SHOULDER AT THE HANDSOME BARONET'S CHARMING BANTER
YOU ONCE SAID MISS LAKE RESUMED THAT SOONER OR LATER I SHOULD BE TAUGHT THE VALUE OF RELIGION AND WOULD LEARN TO PRIZE MY GREAT PRIVILEGES
THEY HAVE THEIR PAROXYSMS LIKE AGUE
THERE ARE LOTS OF THOSE BURGLAR FELLOWS GOING ABOUT YOU KNOW THANK YOU DEAR FOR REMINDING ME
IF I WERE STRONG ENOUGH OR POOR OLD TAMAR I SHOULD HAVE PUT IT AWAY
TO CAPTAIN LAKE MISS BRANDON'S ADIEUX WERE AS COLD AND HAUGHTY AS HER GREETING
YOU TERRIFY ME SAID RACHEL WITH ONE HAND RAISED TOWARD HIS FACE WITH A GESTURE OF HORROR AND ENTREATY AND THE OTHER CLOSED UPON HIS WRIST
CHAPTER XXI
AND LAY HELPLESS IN THE STOCKS AWAITING THE JUDGMENT OF BUDDLE
WHEN I HEARD THE SERVANT'S STEP TRAVERSING THAT LONG GALLERY AS IT SEEMED TO THE IN HASTE TO BE GONE AND WHEN ALL GREW QUITE SILENT I BEGAN TO FEEL A DISMAL SORT OF SENSATION AND LIGHTED THE PAIR OF WAX CANDLES WHICH I FOUND UPON THE SMALL WRITING TABLE
I WENT THROUGH HALF-A-DOZEN OTHERS AND RECURRED TO IT AND PUZZLED OVER ITS EXTERIOR AGAIN AND AGAIN POSTPONED WHAT I FANCIED WOULD PROVE A DISAGREEABLE DISCOVERY
UPON MY WORD I DON'T KNOW WHY THE GIRL MARRIES YOU
LAWYER LARKIN WAS ON THE WHOLE I DARE SAY TOLERABLY WELL PLEASED WITH THE POSITION AS HE WOULD HAVE SAID OF HIS SPIRITUAL INTEREST AND BELONGED TO THAT COMPLACENT CONGREGATION WHO SAID I AM RICH AND HAVE NEED OF NOTHING AND WHO NO DOUBT OPENED THEIR EYES WIDE ENOUGH AND MISDOUBTED THE ASTOUNDING REPORT OF THEIR EARS WHEN THE JUDGE THUNDERED THOU ART WRETCHED AND MISERABLE AND POOR AND BLIND AND NAKED WHEN JOS
WHY HAS HE SENT YOU HERE
AT LAST THERE CAME A GREAT UPBRAIDING A GREAT ECLAIRCISSEMENT AND LAUGHTER AND CRYING AND HUGGING
THE LADY ROSE IN A SOFT FLOATING WAY
SITTING IN MY WELL-STUFFED CHAIR MY ELBOWS ON THE CUSHIONED ARMS THE CONVERSATION OF LAKE AND THE TOWN CLERK NOW AND THEN GREW FAINT AND THEIR FACES FADED AWAY AND LITTLE FYTTES AND FRAGMENTS OF THOSE LIGHT AND PLEASANT DREAMS LIKE FAIRY TALES WHICH VISIT SUCH STOLEN NAPS SUPERSEDED WITH THEIR PICTURESQUE AND MUSICAL ILLUSIONS THE REALITIES AND RECOLLECTIONS OF LIFE
NONE OF HIS FAMILY EVER DID WHEN THEY CAME TO LIE ON A BED OF SICKNESS OR OF DEATH EITHER NO NO SAID RACHEL WILDLY
I SUPPOSE WE HAD BETTER PERHAPS PUT IT ASIDE AND MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE MAY TURN UP AND THE ATTORNEY ROSE GRANDLY TO REPLACE THE STATEMENT OF TITLE IN ITS TIN BOX INTIMATING THEREBY THAT THE AUDIENCE WAS ENDED
HE WAS DEADLY PALE WITH HIS FAINT UNPLEASANT SMILE
I THINK AS MY FRIEND AND A FRIEND TO THE BRANDON FAMILY YOU OUGHT TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO DELAY IF YOU COULD NOT STOP IT
I TRUST YOU DORCAS IN EVERYTHING IMPLICITLY
CHAPTER LV
AND I FEAR THEY WILL EXECUTE ANY POWERS THEY POSSESS IN THE MOST SUMMARY MANNER THE ATTORNEY'S EYE WAS UPON THE VICAR AS HE SPOKE BUT LORD CHELFORD ANSWERED
YOU THINK THEN MR LAKE THERE MAY BE SOME SERIOUS--A--A--WELL I SHOULD HOPE NOT--I DO MOST EARNESTLY TRUST NOT THIS WAS SAID WITH UPTURNED EYES AND MUCH UNCTION
THE ENTIRE AMOUNT IT IS TRUE WAS NOT VERY GREAT
I WAS MERELY SUPPOSING A DEALING BETWEEN FRIENDS AND IN THAT SENSE I VENTURED TO NAME THE EXTREME LIMIT TO WHICH I COULD GO
AND THEIR VIRTUES MORE REMARKED PERHAPS THAN BEFORE THE STONE-CUTTER WAS INSTRUCTED TO PUBLISH THEM WITH HIS CHISEL ANSWERED LAKE WITH ONE OF HIS QUIET SNEERS
INDEED AT ONE TIME I THINK SHE HAD HALF MADE UP HER MIND TO FIGHT THE OLD BATTLE OVER AGAIN AND RESOLUTELY EXERCISE THIS FATAL PASSION
FOR MY PART I DOUBT IF SHE UNDERSTANDS HERSELF--_I CERTAINLY DON'T DORCAS SMILED BITTERLY
AND IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT IF YOU DON'T MAKE TWO TEN-AND-SIX A SHARE
THE THING--IN FACT THERE HAS BEEN SOME GOSSIPING FELLOW
INDEED
THAT BALLAD YOU KNOW EXPRESSES IT VERY PRETTILY:--"OH THOU HAST BEEN THE CAUSE OF THIS ANGUISH MY MOTHER IT WAS NOT THEN AS OLD A SONG AS IT IS NOW
THE NATURE OF HIS INJURY CONSIDERED CAPTAIN LAKE RECOVERED WITH WONDERFUL REGULARITY AND RAPIDITY
AS TO MINE IN A WAY THAT PLAINLY EXPRESSED THEY ARE MERELY PUT DOWN FOR FORM'S SAKE
SURELY THE CHELFORDS WHO HAVE AN INFLUENCE THERE OUGHT TO HAVE EXERTED IT TO PREVENT HER DOING ANYTHING SO MAD
SHE WINCED AT THE NAME AND BRUSHED HER HAND TO HER EAR
RACHEL DEAR I SOMETIMES THINK THERE IS AN EVIL GENIUS ATTENDANT ON OUR FAMILY CONTINUED DORCAS IN THE SAME SUBDUED TONE WHICH IN ITS VERY SWEETNESS HAD SO SINISTER A SOUND IN RACHEL'S EAR
A PUPIL OR TWO AND A SUCCESS WITH HIS WORK ON THE CHARACTER AND INACCURACIES OF EUSEBIUS WOULD MAKE MATTERS SQUARE IN A LITTLE TIME
SHE WAS HERSELF SO ASTONISHED THAT FOR A GOOD WHILE SHE COULD HARDLY COLLECT HER THOUGHTS OR BELIEVE HER SENSES
HE FELT TRUCULENTLY AND WOULD HAVE MURDERED THAT WEEK IF HE COULD IN THE MIDST OF ITS LOITERING SUNSHINE AND GAIETY
HOW WOMEN DO CONTRIVE TO WASTE OUR TIME AND PATIENCE OVER NONSENSE
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING SINCE MR LARKIN
DESPAIR IS FATALISM AND CAN'T HELP ITSELF
HE HAD A HIGH STAND-UP COLLAR TO THE CAPE HE WORE WHICH COVERED HIS CHEEKS AND NOSE AND OUTSIDE WAS LOOSELY SWATHED A LARGE CREAM-COLOURED CASHMERE HANDKERCHIEF
HE'LL RESIGN
THIS DUTY DISCHARGED SHE INSISTED IN THE INTEREST OF HER RHEUMATISM UPON CHANGE OF AIR
LARKIN ESQ THE LODGE GYLINGDEN ANNOUNCING THE FACT THAT HE HAD OVERDRAWN HIS ACCOUNT CERTAIN POUNDS SHILLINGS AND PENCE AND INVITING HIM FORTHWITH TO RESTORE THE BALANCE
HE HAD NO PARTICULAR OBJECTION TO A MYSTERY
I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU MISS LAKE CALL ME RACHEL
SHE IS NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS
I'VE KNOWN HIM HIT UPON SUCH ORIGINAL EXPEDIENTS AND MAKE SUCH WONDERFUL SUCCESSES SO WITH A KIND SMILE HE LEFT THE ROOM
I DON'T LOVE YOUR CRAGS AND PEAKS AND SOMBRE GRANDEUR NOR YET THE FAT FLAT LUXURIANCE OF OUR OTHER COUNTIES
NOW YOU'RE A MORAL MAN CHARLIE TELL ME REALLY WHAT YOU THINK OF A FELLOW MARRYING A GIRL HE DOES NOT CARE THAT FOR AND HE SNAPT HIS FINGERS
WHAT CAN HE WANT OF MARK WYLDER
WYLDER HIS SISTER-IN-LAW AT HIS LEFT BUT SHE WAS ENTERTAINING LORD CHELFORD NOW
I NEVER WAS SO UNEASY
AS THEY DID SO RACHEL LAKE WENT SWIFTLY AND SILENTLY BEFORE HER BROTHER
IT IS OPPOSITE THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM--A SEQUESTERED PHILOSOPHIC RETREAT
I PROTEST BEFORE HEAVEN MY DARLING THERE IS NOT ONE WORD OR ACT OF MINE I NEED FEAR TO SUBMIT TO ANY COURT OF JUSTICE OR OF HONOUR ON EARTH HE TOOK HER HAND AND KISSED IT AFFECTIONATELY AND STILL FONDLING IT GENTLY BETWEEN HIS HE RESUMED I DON'T MEAN TO SAY OF COURSE THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BETTER THAN OTHER YOUNG FELLOWS
NO LIVING WOMAN EVER SHOWED A PALER FACE AND SHE STARED WITH A LOOK THAT WAS SHARP AND STERN UPON THE WAINSCOT BEFORE HER
AND NOW THEY TURNED AND WALKED SLOWLY SIDE BY SIDE ALONG THE BROAD WALK BY THAT PERPENDICULAR WALL OF CRISP BROWN LEAVES HE RECOGNISED ALSO A CERTAIN HITCH IN HIS SHOULDER WHICH MADE HIM SWEAR AND ASSEVERATE AGAIN
BUT THE FACT IS MY DEAR MR WYLDER SIX HUNDRED POUNDS WOULD LEAVE LITTLE MORE THAN A HUNDRED REMAINING AFTER BURLINGTON AND SMITH HAVE HAD THEIR COSTS
HE WAS SO SOCIABLE AND NEEDED SYMPATHY AND COMPANIONSHIP AND REPAID IT WITH A BOUNDLESS SENSITIVE LOVE
THE POOR VICAR AND HIS LITTLE FOLLOWING WERE GOT PRETTY WELL INTO THE FURCAE CAUDINAE
ONLY OF COURSE I DON'T DECLINE TO FULFIL MY PART WHENEVER AT LIBERTY
WHAT'S DONE CANNOT BE UNDONE SAID RACHEL SADLY AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE UNCONSCIOUSLY QUOTING FROM A TERRIBLE SOLILOQUY OF SHAKESPEARE
BUT THERE WAS NO WAY AND HE MUST REST CONTENT WITH SUCH REPORT AS HIS EYES MIGHT FURNISH
WHILE I WAS AT MY TOILET IN CAME MARK WYLDER LAUGHING AS WAS HIS WONT AND VERY UNCEREMONIOUSLY HE TOOK POSSESSION OF MY EASY-CHAIR AND THREW HIS LEG OVER THE ARM OF IT
BUT I BEG YOUR PARDON
AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE A ROOM AT THE HALL AND CAPITAL SHOOTING WHEN WE RETURN WHICH WILL BE IN A FORTNIGHT AFTER I CAN'T SAY THAT WYLDER WAS AN OLD FRIEND
THE POWERS YOU SPEAK OF ARE QUITE WITHOUT PARALLEL IN A NEGOTIATION TO PURCHASE
HE DID NOT BUT HE STRUCK LAKE WITH THE BACK OF HIS HAND IN THE FACE AND LAKE WHO WALKED BY HIS SIDE WITH HIS FINGERS ON THE HANDLE OF A DAGGER IN HIS COAT POCKET INSTANTLY RETORTED WITH A STAB WHICH HE REPEATED AS MARK FELL
AND HE AND LADY CHELFORD WILL STAY FOR THE HUNT BALL
AND IF MISS DORCAS MISS BRANDON YOU KNOW--SHOULD WISH TO GO UP TO SEE HER TELL HER SHE'S ASLEEP
JENNY PUT THE KETTLE ON OLD LADY CHELFORD HAVING DESPATCHED A SHARP AND UNCEREMONIOUS MESSAGE TO HER YOUNG KINSWOMAN ABSENT WITHOUT LEAVE WARNING HER IN EFFECT THAT IF SHE RETURNED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM IT WOULD BE TO PRESIDE ALONE OVER GENTLEMEN DEPARTED SOMEWHAT TO OUR SECRET RELIEF
SOMETHING MA'AM--A PERSON--I CAN'T EXACTLY TELL--ABOVE THE STEPS IN THE BLACKBERRY PATH
OH SAID MR LARKIN IN A LOW REVERENTIAL TONE AND THE SMILE VANISHED
SEND IN THE MORNING AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT AND THE CAPTAIN RATHER SAVAGELY TURNED AWAY SKIRTING THE CROWD WHO HOVERED ABOUT THE BAND IN HIS LEISURELY AND NOW SOLITARY RAMBLE
IT WILL PERHAPS CONDUCE TO CLEARNESS TO DISPOSE OF THIS PART OF THE MATTER FIRST
THE LADIES HAD ACCOMPLISHED THEIR ASCENSION TO THE UPPER REGIONS
NOT BEING ABLE BY ANY ENDEAVOUR'--(HERE A NAUTICAL PHRASE SCRATCHED OUT AND ENDEAVOUR SUBSTITUTED)--'OF MINE TO BE UP TO TIME AND AS THESE ARE P.P
HAD HE BEEN THERE TO-DAY?--NO
SO THE YOUNG PEOPLE SITTING IN THE LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM OF REDMAN'S FARM PURSUED THEIR DIALOGUE
I ALMOST THINK YOU'RE MAD STANLEY
DO YOU SUPPOSE I AM A HIGHWAYMAN IN DISGUISE OR A MURDERER LIKE--WHAT'S HIS NAME--EUGENE ARAM
THEN FOLLOWED SOME CONVERSATION WHICH I DARE SAY INTERESTED THE LAWYER MORE THAN BE QUITE SHOWED IN MR JOHNSON'S COMPANY
THAT'S PAST A DOUBT NOW
IN MORE TROUBLE THAN YOU SUPPOSE I REMAIN DEAR CHELFORD YOURS WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK FAITHFULLY MARK WYLDER CHAPTER XXIX
HE TREATS THE YOUNG LADY VERY COOLLY THOUGHT RACHEL FORGETTING PERHAPS THAT HIS SPECIAL RELATIONS TO DORCAS BRANDON HAD COMPELLED HIS STAY IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD
IT WILL PRODUCE MR YOUNG SAYS A VERY LARGE SUM AND I WISH TO LEND IT TO YOU EITHER ALL OR AS MUCH AS WILL MAKE YOU QUITE COMFORTABLE--YOU MUST NOT REFUSE
AND TWO OR THREE TIMES WHEN THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY'S ATTENTION SEEMED UNACCOUNTABLY TO WANDER FROM HIS AGREEABLE CONVERSATION HE THOUGHT HE DETECTED HER HAUGHTY EYE MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION
IT WAS NOT PROVED ONLY THOUGHT LIKELY WHICH SHOWED WHAT A NICE CHARACTER HE WAS
MR LARKIN SAID HE TURNING VERY GRATEFULLY TO THE ATTORNEY YOU CAN LAY THIS CHRISTIAN COMFORT TO YOUR KIND HEART THAT YOU HAVE MADE MINE A HUNDREDFOLD LIGHTER SINCE I ENTERED THIS BLESSED ROOM
THAT D--D OLD MADMAN IS MADDER THAN EVER SAID LAKE IN HIS FELLEST TONES LOOKING STEADFASTLY WITH HIS PECULIAR GAZE UPON THE CLOSED DOOR
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO BE PLEASED OR SORRY THAT RACHEL HAD REFUSED TO RESIDE AT BRANDON
IT WAS SUCH AN EXAGGERATED PORTRAIT AS A RUSTIC GENIUS MIGHT HAVE EXECUTED UPON A SIGN-BOARD
MAY I SAY YOU'LL COME RACHEL SMILED SADLY ON THE SNOW-DROPS AT HER FEET AND SHOOK HER HEAD A LITTLE
AND WHEN NEXT I CAN LAY MY HAND UPON HIM I'LL MAKE HIM EAT THAT PAPER ON HIS KNEES AND PLACE MY HEEL UPON HIS NECK THE PERORATION OF THIS PECULIAR INVECTIVE WAS EMPHASISED BY AN OATH AT WHICH THE HALF-DOZEN SHORT GRIZZLED HAIRS THAT SURMOUNTED THE TOP OF MR JOS
AND HOW IS MISS RACHEL VERY BAD WITH A HEADACHE PLEASE SIR IS SHE AT HOME YES SIR PLEASE ANY MESSAGE YES SIR PLEASE--A NOTE FOR YOU SIR AND SHE PRODUCED A NOTE RATHER INDEED A LETTER
NO ILL-WILL CERTAINLY--QUITE THE REVERSE
GYLINGDEN WAS QUITE IN AN UPROAR
HE KNEW VERY WELL HOW TO TAKE CARE OF HIS MONEY
THIS PORTION OF HIS DISCOURSE HE DISMISSED RATHER SLIGHTLY AND MYSTERIOUSLY
IT IS PLAIN THAT THE LETTERS ARE WRITTEN IN BATCHES--SEVERAL AT A TIME--AND COMMITTED TO SOME ONE TO CARRY FROM TOWN TO TOWN AND POST HAVING PREVIOUSLY FILLED IN DATES TO MAKE THEM CORRESPOND WITH THE EXACT PERIOD OF POSTING THEM THE ATTORNEY'S SEARCHING GAZE WAS FIXED ON THE CAPTAIN AS HE SAID THIS WITH ALL THE SIGNIFICANCE CONSISTENT WITH CIVILITY
WYLDER WAS SURPRISED PUZZLED AND A GOOD DEAL INCENSED--THAT SAUCY CRAFT HAD FIRED HER SHOT SO UNEXPECTEDLY ACROSS HIS BOWS
HE HAD MADE A SPLENDID PURCHASE FROM CAPTAIN LAKE IT WAS TRUE
SO I SUPPOSE I FELT FOR THOUGH I WISHED TO THINK HER STUPID I COULD NOT
NO DARLING--NOTHING
MARGERY BRING MY GLOVES AND CLOAK AND SHE UNPINNED THE FADED SILK SHAWL THAT DID DUTY IN THE GARDEN AND DREW OFF HER GAUNTLETS AND SHOWED HER PRETTY HANDS
I TOLD HER MY EARLY RECOLLECTIONS OF BRANDON AND GYLINGDEN AND HOW I REMEMBERED HER A BABY AND SAID SOME GRACEFUL TRIFLES ON THAT THEME WHICH I FANCIED WERE LIKELY TO PLEASE
I DON'T THINK HE'S MUCH OF A SPORTSMAN HA ISN'T HE
YOU'VE BEEN SO VERY GOOD
I'M VERY THANKFUL SIR SAID MR LARCOM VERY BUT DO SIT DOWN MR LARCOM--PRAY DO SAID THE ATTORNEY WHO WAS VERY GRACIOUS TO LARCOM
THERE'S A SPORTING OFFER FOR YOU
ON SECOND THOUGHTS THIS NIGHT HE COOLLY APPRISED ME THAT HE HAD SOME IDEA OF SOUNDING THE ELECTORS
WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING-ROOM A TOILET BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
BUT YOU KNOW MY POOR BROTHER WHY I CONSENTED AND WITH WHAT AGONY
IT WAS WELL THEY HAD STOPPED JUST BY THE STEM OF A GREAT ASH TREE AGAINST WHICH RACHEL LEANED FOR SOME SECONDS WITH DARKNESS BEFORE HER EYES AND THE ROAR OF A WHIRLPOOL IN HER EARS
THERE THE EXAMINATION WAS CONTINUED AND HIS WATCH THE CHAIN BROKEN FOUND IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
MERE DISTRACTION
I'LL GO AS FAR AS I CAN BUT IT IS VERY LATE YOU KNOW--AND YOU ARE SURE YOU ARE NOT AFRAID I OUGHT TO BE AFRAID OF NOTHING NOW STANLEY BUT I THINK I AM AFRAID OF EVERYTHING MERELY A LITTLE NERVOUS--IT'S NOTHING--I'VE BEEN WRETCHEDLY SINCE MYSELF
NOW HE WAS GOING INTO THIS BUSINESS AS HE DID INTO OTHERS METHODICALLY
THEIR VERY WILLS WERE SPICED WITH THE DEVILMENT OF THE TESTATORS AND ABOUNDED IN INSINUATIONS AND EVEN LANGUAGE WHICH WERE SCANDALOUS
I HAD RATHER YOU DID
HE OUGHT TO BE IN A MADHOUSE HE USED TO BE VERY QUIET SAID THE TOWN CLERK WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT HIM
AS RACHEL STOOD IN HER LITTLE GARDEN ON THE SPOT WHERE SHE HAD BIDDEN FAREWELL TO THE VICAR SHE WAS ROUSED FROM HER VAGUE AND DISMAL REVERIE BY THE SOUND OF A CARRIAGE CLOSE AT HAND
IT HAD NOT A GOOD COUNTENANCE SOMEHOW
YOU AND I ARE MADE FOR ONE ANOTHER--THE SAME BLOOD--SOMETHING OF THE SAME WILD NATURE
HE WAS ALWAYS SO ANGRY WHEN I URGED HIM TO HELP THEM THAT I KNEW IT WOULD BE USELESS ASKING HIM
AND NOW SAID SHE CHELFORD OUGHT NOT WE TO SEND FOR POOR RACHEL
WHO WERE THE WITNESSES
AND I WILL TAKE A DECIDED COURSE
OH HO
IT IS NOT TOO LATE
AND THE MORAL RESPIRATION CIRCULATION INSENSIBLE PERSPIRATION AND ALL THE REST OF THAT PECULIAR MORAL SYSTEM WHICH EXHIBITED ITS TYPE IN JOS
AND I DO BELIEVE AS HOW MR MARK WYLDER IS CONFINED IN A MAD-HOUSE AND THE CAPTAIN KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT AND WON'T DO NOTHING TO GET HIM OUT H'M--VERY ODD--VERY STRANGE
SOME OF MY READERS WILL REMEMBER
I DON'T KNOW RACHEL--I DON'T LIKE IT--I'M NOT FIT FOR IT
THE WYLDERS OF BRANDON APPEAR VERY EARLY IN HISTORY
AND THEN CAME A DEEP SIGH
IT WAS TOO DARK AND THE WAY NOT QUITE REGULAR ENOUGH TO RENDER ANY GREATER SPEED PRACTICABLE
THIS OLD WOMAN HAD IN HER FACE AND AIR ALONG WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SUSPICION AND ANXIETY A CERTAIN CHARACTER OF DECENCY AND RESPECTABILITY WHICH MADE HER ALTOGETHER A PUZZLING AND UNPLEASANT APPARITION
YOU HAVE CERTAINLY HAD RELATIONS WITH MR MARK WYLDER--CORRESPONDENCE FOR ANYTHING I KNOW
I SAY I'LL SEE HIM NO MORE
BUT IT MAY PROVE TO BE STRICTLY TRUE
HE LOOKED A LITTLE FLUSHED AND DARTED A STEALTHY GLANCE ACROSS THE TABLE BUT NO ONE HE THOUGHT HAD OBSERVED THE MANOEUVRE
WHATEVER IT WAS RACHEL PROBABLY KNEW IT
HE'S NOT PARTICULARLY POLITE WHOEVER HE IS THOUGHT MR LARKIN WITH A SNIFF
DOES NOT IT QUITE REALISE YOUR CONCEPTION CAPTAIN LAKE OF YOUNG LOCHINVAR YOU KNOW AND HIS FAIR HELEN SO STATELY HIS FORM AND SO LOVELY HER FACE YOU REMEMBER THAT NEVER A HALL SUCH A GALLIARD DID GRACE
LEAN FORWARD BELLOWED WEALDON AGAIN
I SAW IT STANDING AMONG THE LOTUS AND HEMLOCK
LARKIN ON THE GREEN NOT FIVE MINUTES SINCE AND THITHER THE GALLANT CAPTAIN BENT HIS STEPS
MISS BRANDON HAD LEFT THE ROOM
AND NOW FOR MYSELF
DON'T REJECT MY POOR ENTREATY
POOR WILLIAM SOUND IN MORALS FREE FROM VICE NO DANDY A QUIET BOOKISH SELF-DENYING MORTAL WAS YET WHEN HE TOOK HOLY ORDERS AND QUITTED HIS CHAMBERS AT CAMBRIDGE AS MUCH IN DEBT AS MANY A SCAMP OF HIS COLLEGE
AND HE CALLED AT HOCKLEY ON HIS WAY BACK TO SEE SIR JULIUS
I SAW HONEST TOM WEALDON ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AGO--GROWN STOUTER AND SOMEWHAT MORE PHLEGMATIC BY TIME BUT STILL THE SAME IN GOOD NATURE AND INQUISITIVENESS
WHEN STANLEY LAKE SAW THE VICAR THE LINES OF HIS PALE FACE CONTRACTED STRANGELY AND HIS WILD GAZE FOLLOWED HIM AND I DON'T THINK HE BREATHED ONCE UNTIL THE THIN SMILING MAN IN BLACK WITH THE LITTLE GAMBOLLING BRIGHT BOY HOLDING BY HIS HAND HAD PASSED BY
HE WAS DESTINED HOWEVER BEFORE VERY LONG TO REVISIT THESE SCENES
SUDDEN AS A SIGH AND COLD
THINGS HAVE TURNED OUT DIFFERENT
I HAVE FORFEITED HIS GOOD-WILL SOMEHOW--HE HAS CEASED TO TAKE ANY INTEREST IN MY WRETCHED AFFAIRS
ST ANGE COULD NOT WAIT UNTIL HE HAD LAID THEM DOWN BUT BROKE OUT WITH OH MI LOR!--QU'EST-IL ARRIVE?--LE PAUVRE CAPITAINE
IS HE DEAD SAID DORCAS WITH THE PECULIAR STERNNESS OF AGONY
ALL READY IN A MOMENT LIKE A YOUNG LADY OF ENERGY
SOMETHING LIKE A STUNTED BLACKENED BRANCH WAS STICKING OUT OF THE PEAT ENDING IN A SET OF SHORT THICKISH TWIGS
YOU CHASSER MR WYLDER WITHOUT ONE MOMENT'S NOTICE AND WITHOUT DEIGNING TO CONSULT ME OR ANY OTHER PERSON CAPABLE OF ADVISING YOU
YOU HAD BETTER COME IN AND REST NO DORCAS I WON'T GO IN BUT RACHEL YOU ARE TIRED
WHILE IT LAY ON THE TABLE THE ROOM BECAME THE HOLY OF HOLIES IN HIS DARK RELIGION
I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY HE HAS COME DOWN HERE OR WHAT HE CAN POSSIBLY WANT OF THAT DISAGREEABLE LAWYER
THERE ENDS MY SHARE IN YOUR CONFIDENCE AND YOUR FORTUNES
BUT NEEDS MUST WHEN THE OLD BOY DRIVES
AND OF COURSE WAGES AND ALL THAT WILL BE IN PROPORTION WELL JIM HAD NOT ANY OBJECTION TO SPEAK OF
WITH DOWNCAST LOOK AND AN ANGRY CONTORTION HE TORE THE SHEETS OF NOTE-PAPER ACROSS AND WAS ON THE POINT OF REDUCING THEM TO A THOUSAND LITTLE SNOW FLAKES AND GIVING THEM TO THE WIND WHEN ON SECOND THOUGHTS HE CRUMPLED THEM TOGETHER AND THRUST THEM INTO HIS BREAST POCKET
YOU WERE RIGHT RADIE--I THINK I'M NOT EQUAL TO A BUSINESS OF THIS SORT AND I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO SUCH A SCENE
SHE WAS IN THE CONSERVATORY AMONGST HER FLOWERS AND ON SEEING HIM STEPPED INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM
WITH RACHEL THIS WEAKNESS DID NOT LAST LONG
BUT SHE SAW THAT HE WAS SMILING HIS SLY SLEEPY SMILE AND SHE SAID QUIETLY WELL STANLEY I ASK NO MORE--BUT YOU DON'T DECEIVE ME I DON'T TRY TO
BUT YOU ARE RIGHT--AND I'M RIGHT AND WE ARE ALL RIGHT--IT IS THE BEST THING FOR US BOTH
I'M NO SUCH IDIOT
HE DECLINES STATING ANY REASON FOR HIS WITHDRAWAL
ONCE THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN BEHIND THE DISTANT HILLS IT WAS THE DARKEST THE MOST SILENT AND THE MOST SOLITARY OF NOOKS
IN WHICH I GO TO BRANDON AND SEE AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE IN THE TAPESTRY ROOM
MARK WYLDER'S SUBMISSION
FIVE OAKS IS AN ESTATE IN ITSELF
AND DOLLY IF YOU ALLOW THIS SALE YOU DESERVE THE RUIN YOU ARE INVITING AND THE REMORSE THAT WILL FOLLOW YOU TO YOUR GRAVE DO YOU HEAR THAT WILLIE SAID DOLLY WITH HER HAND ON HIS ARM
BUT IT CONTINUED AND GREW GRADUALLY UNPLEASANT
AN YOU'LL NEVER SEE HIM OUT AGAIN IF THE CAPTING HAS HIS WILL DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU ACTUALLY THINK HE'S SHUT UP IN A MADHOUSE AT THIS MOMENT DEMANDED THE ATTORNEY
I DID NOT VENTURE TO CULTIVATE HER
I WENT DOWN AND TOOK POSSESSION ON THE 4TH THE TENANTS VERY GLAD AND SO THEY MIGHT WELL BE
AND SHADOWY FIGURES WITH CUES IN THEIR HANDS GLIDING HITHER AND THITHER ACROSS ITS UNCURTAINED WINDOWS
I WILL KNOW NO MORE SECRETS--NO MORE DISGRACE
IT WAS AT GRAY'S CLUB IN PALL MALL
MAJOR JACKSON WAS VERY NERVOUS INDEED
THE IDEA BESIDES COULD NOT BE RECONCILED WITH THE FACTS OF THE CASE
LAKE PLUNGED THE SPURS INTO HIS BEAST WHICH REARED SO STRAIGHT THAT SHE TOPPLED BACKWARD TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE
HE KNOWS SOMETHING OF HORSES I BELIEVE AND SOMETHING OF PLAY BUT HE'LL HARDLY MAKE OUT A LIVING THAT WAY SAID WYLDER WITH A SORT OF SNEER OR LAUGH
THAT MEAL PASSED OFF RATHER PLEASANTLY
AN OLD FRIEND LOOKS INTO THE GARDEN AT REDMAN'S FARM
DORCAS'S LARGE EYES RESTED UPON HER WITH A GRAVE ENQUIRY AND THEN MISS BRANDON LOOKED DOWN IN SILENCE FOR A WHILE ON THE CARPET AND WAS THINKING A LITTLE STERNLY MAYBE AND WITH A LOOK OF PAIN STILL HOLDING RACHEL'S HAND SHE SAID WITH A SAD SORT OF REPROACH IN HER TONE RACHEL DEAR YOU HAVE NOT TOLD MY SECRET NO INDEED DORCAS--NEVER AND NEVER WILL
PERHAPS YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO LOOK AT THE TIMES AND I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR THE SARDINES THE POSTMARK HOCKLEY STARED THE LAWYER IN THE FACE
AND HELD HER HANDS SOME SECONDS LONGER THAN IS STRICTLY USUAL IN SUCH A GREETING
AND HIS CONFIDENTIAL FRIENDS KNEW THAT IN A TRANSACTION IN WHICH HE HAD PAID MONEY OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET FOR SIR MULGRAVE HE HAD NEVER GOT BACK MORE THAN SEVEN AND SIXPENCE IN THE POUND
I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY THE PROS AND CONS OF THAT MIGRATION TO BRANDON AGAINST WHICH RACHEL HAD PRONOUNCED SO FIRMLY
ONE CROP OF CARES WILL ALWAYS SUCCEED ANOTHER--NOT VERY OPPRESSIVE NOR IN ANY WISE GRAND PERHAPS--WORRIES SIMPLY NO MORE
AND YOU WARNED ME WITH A STRANGE SECOND-SIGHT BEFORE THE EVIL WAS KNOWN TO EITHER OF US
A DIFFERENCE OF FOURTEEN VOTES AND THUS WE WENT ON DISCUSSING THIS UNEXPECTED TURN OF LUCK AND READING TO ONE ANOTHER SNATCHES OF THE LEADING ARTICLES IN DIFFERENT INTERESTS UPON THE SUBJECT
YOU HAVE NO CONCEPTION HOW AND MAY NEVER EVEN SUSPECT
WYLDER WOULD HAVE BEEN SUITABLE IN POINT OF WEALTH
WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOUR DOG SO CHARMING A COMPANION IN YOUR WALKS
AND HE PULLS OUT A LETTER ALL OVER RED RED AYE MISS
HE WAS IN CONFIDENTIAL--WHICH MEANT LUCRATIVE--RELATIONS WITH MARK WYLDER
SO DO THEY SAY THAT MARK IS MARRIED
IT WAS A SPECK AT FIRST
TA-TA DEAR TAMAR
WHAT WILL BE THOUGHT?--WHAT WILL THE WORLD SAY?--WHAT WILL YOUR FRIENDS SAY
I WAS NOT A BIT AFRAID OF BEING FOUND OUT
WYLDER HAD GONE OFF THE SCENE AS MR CARLYLE SAYS INTO INFINITE SPACE
WAS HE STILL ABROAD OR HAD HE ARRIVED
BUT WHENEVER I MEANT TO SUMMAT CAME OVER ME AND I COULDN'T WELL WELL WELL SAID LAKE UNEASILY
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW A PERSON AT ALL VERSED IN GYLINGDEN MATTERS--OR PERHAPS A MEMBER OF YOUR CLUB--NAMED SMITH SMITH
I WAS THE LAST MAN ON EARTH HE WOULD HAVE CONSULTED WITH
I'VE BEEN VERY FOOLISH
I HAVE NO ONE ON EARTH TO CONFIDE IN BUT YOU
THAT PERVERSE AND UTTERLY SELFISH BROTHER STANLEY LAKE HAD CHOSEN TO TAKE HIS LEAVE
AND I DON'T SEE THAT ANY THING IS LIKELY TO COME OF IT THE ATTORNEY SPOKE IN THE SAME DRY AND RESERVED WAY AND THERE WAS A SHADOW ON HIS LONG FACE
YOU DID NOT SEE THAT BEFORE
FEEL ME--I'M COLD AND WHITE ALL OVER--I DIED TOO SOON--I'D HAVE HAD WINGS NOW ONLY FOR THAT PISTOL
I'D BE SO FRIGHTENED IF THERE WAS
YOU'VE NO CAUSE TO HATE HIM
DON'T YOU REMEMBER RASSELAS NO HE SAID LOOKING ROUND HIM
AND CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE LATE OF HER MAJESTY'S
AND I FEEL SURE HE'LL STRIKE OUT SOMETHING FOR OUR POOR PATIENT
I HAVE NOT EITHER
ALL WAS FORGOTTEN AND FORGIVEN IN THAT TREMENDOUS MOMENT
AT PRESENT I AM HARDLY IN A POSITION TO SAY MORE THAN AN ACQUAINTANCE--NEVER I FEAR VERY CORDIAL ON HIS PART--WOULD ALLOW
I KNEW IT CONTINUED RACHEL WITH A KIND OF SHUDDER
THE TALK OF COURSE HAS ITS PAROXYSMS AND ITS SUBSIDENCES
WRETCHED WICKED PUNISHED FOOL YOU SUSPECT WHAT THEY FOUGHT ABOUT RADIE RACHEL MADE NO ANSWER
AN HOUR OF ILLUSION--AN HOUR OF SLEEP--AN HOUR'S RESPITE OF ANY SORT TO SIX HOURS OF PAIN--AND SO THE SOUL IN ANGUISH FINDS STRENGTH FOR ITS LONG LABOUR ABRIDGED BY NEITHER DEATH NOR MADNESS
HE WAS ALSO SOMETHING OF A RELIGIOUS LIGHT AND HAD FOR A TIME CONFORMED TO METHODISM BUT RETURNED TO THE CHURCH
DORCAS HAD READ AND HEARD STORIES OF MEN SEEMINGLY NO WORSE THAN THEIR NEIGHBOURS--NAY HIGHLY ESTEEMED AND PRAISED AND LIKED--WHO YET WERE HAUNTED BY EVIL MEN WHO ENCOUNTERED THEM IN LONELY PLACES OR BY NIGHT AND CONTROLLED THEM BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF SOME DREADFUL CRIME
BUT ON MY PART THERE IS NO FEELING I DO ASSURE YOU BUT THE NATURAL DESIRE TO LIVE ON THE FRIENDLY TERMS WHICH OUR TIES OF FAMILY AND OUR POSITION IN THE COUNTY STANLEY LAKE WAS WRITING THE CHEQUE FOR 200_L MEANWHILE AND HANDED IT TO LARKIN
AND HAVING COMPLETED HIS MYSTERIOUS INCREMATION HE WITH HIS YELLOW EYES MADE A STOLEN GLANCE AROUND AND LIGHTING HIS CIGAR GLIDED GRACEFULLY UP THE STEEP ROAD UNDER THE SOLEMN CANOPY OF OLD TIMBER TO THE SOUND OF THE MOANING STREAM BELOW AND THE RUSTLE OF WITHERED LEAVES ABOUT HIM TOWARD REDMAN'S FARM
MR
MR
AND SIR HARRY REMAINED WITH A GLASS OF PINK CHAMPAGNE SUCH AS YOUNG FELLOWS DRINK WITH A FAITH AND COMFORT SO WONDERFUL AT BALLS AND FETES CHAMPETRES
I'M NOT THE LEAST SURPRISED KNOWING I AM SORRY TO SAY A GOOD DEAL OF THE WAYS OF THE WORLD AND EXPECTING VERY LITTLE GRATITUDE FOR EITHER GOOD WILL OR SERVICES THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH A MELANCHOLY SNEER DIRECTED FULL UPON THE POOR VICAR WHO DID NOT HALF UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION AND LOOKED RATHER GUILTY AND FRIGHTENED
WHAT IS THE MATTER NO DEAR RACHEL NOT ILL ONLY MAYBE AGITATED A LITTLE
PEOPLE DATE BY IT
SHE WAS AFRAID FOR A MINUTE DURING WHICH HE LOITERED THERE THAT HE WAS GOING TO SEAT HIMSELF UPON THE CLOAKS WHICH HE HAD JUST THROWN UPON THE GROUND AND FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY ESCAPE DETECTION FOR MANY SECONDS MORE
WHAT A BEAST THAT FELLOW IS
YET I COULD NOT THINK HER STUPID
NOW I HAVE KNOWN CASES IN WHICH GOOD-NATURED DEBAUCHEES HAVE INTERESTED THEMSELVES CHARITABLY IN THE DIFFICULTIES OF FORLORN FAMILIES
BUT HANG IT
BUT HANG IT
IT IS AN ODD STATE OF THINGS TO HOLD ONE'S ESTATE UNDER CONDITION OF LETTING A MADMAN WANDER ABOUT YOUR HOUSE AND PLACE MAKING EVERYBODY IN IT UNCOMFORTABLE AND INSECURE AND EXPOSING HIM TO THE IMMINENT RISK OF MAKING AWAY WITH HIMSELF EITHER BY ACCIDENT OR DESIGN
AND NOW THAT HIS EYELIDS CLOSED IT SEEMED TO SAY OUR INTERVIEW IS OVER--THE CURTAIN HAS DROPPED
THE DREADFUL ACCENTS THAT VIBRATED WITHIN HER
AND SO THE YOUNG LADY AND LORD CHELFORD WERE LEFT TO PURSUE THEIR WAY TOWARDS REDMAN'S FARM TOGETHER
THEY BOTH FORGOT THAT IT WAS ARITHMETICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO HAVE PREVENTED IT UNLESS HE HAD GOT SOME MONEY
WOMEN ARE SO ENIGMATICAL--SOME IN EVERYTHING--ALL IN MATTERS OF THE HEART
AND YOU DO KNOW THE YOUNG LADY INTIMATELY I SAY SIR I DO NOT REPLIED RACHEL HAUGHTILY AND FIERCELY
IN THE MEANTIME THE FIFTY POUNDS HAD GONE AS WE KNOW DIRECT TO CAMBRIDGE
IT GAVE HIM CONSIDERATION HE FANCIED
I REVISIT BRANDON HALL
NEITHER WAS THERE THE SLIGHTEST RESENTMENT
I SEE IT ALL NOW AND SHE WAVED HER WHITE HANDS TOGETHER VERY SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM AS MESMERISERS MOVE THEIRS
FOR SOME SECONDS I HARDLY KNEW WHERE I WAS
IT WAS A CHEERY LITTLE BED-ROOM WHEN THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THE FIRE BURNING BRIGHTLY IN THE GRATE
WILL YOU GIVE ME JUST A MINUTE MR DE CRESSERON IN THE DRAWING-ROOM WHILE I SHOW YOU A MINIATURE
THESE THOUGHTS WENT WHISKING AND WHIRLING ROUND IN CAPTAIN LAKE'S BRAIN TO THE ROAR AND CLATTER OF THE JOINVILLE POLKA TO WHICH FIFTY PAIR OF DANCING FEET WERE HOPPING AND SKIMMING OVER THE FLOOR
I AM ABANDONED AND MUST BE RUINED THESE DREADFUL THOUGHTS FILLED IN ANOTHER SILENCE
HE HAD BEEN THERE THAT EVENING BEFORE SHORTLY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL WITH OLD MOTHER DUTTON AS HE CALLED HER ABOUT HER SON JIM
STANLEY IS AN ODD CREATURE SAID RACHEL SO SOON AS ANOTHER SLIGHT INCLINE BROUGHT THEM TO A WALK
TRUST MY SURE CONVICTION AND PROMISE ME DORCAS THAT YOU WILL NOT HESITATE TO JOIN ME IN AVERTING BY A SACRIFICE WE SHALL HARDLY FEEL A REALLY STUPENDOUS BLOW HE KISSED HER HAND AND THEN HER LIPS AND HE SAID YOU WILL DORKIE I KNOW YOU WILL
ITS EXPRESSION WAS QUITE AS USUAL--NOT ACTUALLY DISCONTENT OR PEEVISHNESS BUT CRIMPED AND PUCKERED ALL OVER WITH UNCHANGING LINES OF ANXIETY AND SUFFERING
AND AT SUCH TIMES I BELIEVE THAT ANYONE MIGHT SAY ANYTHING TO THE REVELLER AT HIS ELBOW WITHOUT THE SMALLEST RISK OF BEING OVERHEARD BY MORTAL
MANY SAID THE SEER
THE DEAD THEMSELVES DECLARE THEIR DREADFUL SECRETS OPEN-MOUTHED TO THE WINDS
BUT I AM NOT VERY WELL AND A VERY DULL COMPANION TO-DAY YOU THINK I AM GOING TO BORE YOU WITH VISITS
AND WITH A MAN OF HIS STAMP SPECULATION WHICH GOES UPON GUESS AS TO DATES AND QUANTITIES WHICH ARE ALL ASCERTAINABLE BY REFERENCE TO BLACK AND WHITE SOON LOSES ITS INTEREST
A RETROSPECT OF A SCORE OF YEARS OR SO AT THREE-AND-THIRTY IS A MUCH VASTER AFFAIR THAN A MUCH LONGER ONE AT FIFTY
DON'T MENTION WHERE I WRITE FROM NOR EVEN SO MUCH AS MY NAME
ASK NICELY YOU KNOW
LIFTING UP HER EYES SHE SAW LORD CHELFORD LOOKING OVER THE LITTLE GATE
AND I'LL TELL YOU ALL THE NEWS
A PLEASANT DAY A LIGHT AIR A FROSTY SUN
THERE ARE OPERATIONS OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH GO ON ACTIVELY WITHOUT YOUR BEING AWARE OF THEM
STANLEY LAKE DID NOT APPEAR THAT DAY
AND HE SMILED INEFFABLE PITY OVER THE CRUMPLED NEWSPAPER--ON THE POOR SOULS IN THAT SORT OF WORLDLY LIMBO
THE SECOND HONOUR_--BOTH INVOLUNTARY
AH DOROTHY
IF YOU WISH IT I WILL WRITE TO BURLINGTON SMITH AND COMPANY ABOUT IT--THEY ARE LARGELY IN POLICIES AND POST-OBITS IT IS VERY SAD--VERY SAD INDEED
LARKIN IS VIS-A-VIS WITH A CONCEALED COMPANION LXVIII.--THE COMPANION DISCLOSES HIMSELF LXIX.--OF A SPECTRE WHOM OLD TAMAR SAW LXX.--THE MEETING IN THE LONG POND ALLEY LXXI.--SIR HARRY BRACTON'S INVASION OF GYLINGDEN LXXII.--MARK WYLDER'S HAND LXXIII.--THE MASK FALLS LXXIV.--WE TAKE LEAVE OF OUR FRIENDS WYLDER'S HAND
HE IS VERY CLEVER
BUT LITTLE MAN WAS LEANING BACK
HE LOOKED A LITTLE CONFUSEDLY AND HE CONVEYED THAT HE WOULD NOT LIKE TO BE IN ANYTHING THAT WAS NOT QUITE STRAIGHT
YOU WILL BE WALKING WITH WAPSIE IN A WEEK AGAIN THE SUN COULD AS SOON CEASE FROM SHINING AS LITTLE FAIRY FROM LIVING
AND--AND HOW ARE THE FAMILY AT BRANDON--ALL WELL I TRUST MR LARCOM BLEW HIS NOSE
THERE IS HOPE IN THAT DESPAIR AND HE LOOKED AT HER WITH GREAT INTEREST IN HIS GENTLE EYES
SINCE THE VOLUMINOUS DESPATCH FROM MARSEILLES PROMISING HIS RETURN SO SOON NOT A LINE HAD BEEN RECEIVED FROM MARK WYLDER
IT WOULD BE BETTER SIR--THE PUBLICITY OF AN ARREST IT WAS A HARD WORD TO UTTER IN THE TOWN WOULD BE VERY PAINFUL--IT WOULD BE BETTER I THINK THAT I SHOULD WALK OVER TO THE PRISON--IT IS ONLY SIX MILES--AND SEE THE AUTHORITIES THERE AND GIVE MYSELF UP AND HIS LIP QUIVERED
I ONLY KNOW THAT HIS VISIT TO GYLINGDEN MUST HAVE BEEN MADE WITH SOME SERIOUS PURPOSE AND HIS IDEAS ARE ALL SO RASH AND VIOLENT HE WAS AT DONNYSTON FOR TEN DAYS I THINK WHEN I WAS THERE AND SEEMED CLEVER
THAT IS OF COURSE WHEN YOU ARE ALONE ANSWERED STANLEY SERENELY
WONDERFUL FINE WINE THAT!--BUT STILL I'M TOLD THIS IS NOT A BAD WINE NOTWITHSTANDING LARCOM RECEIVED IT WITH GRAVE GRATITUDE AND SIPPED IT AND SPOKE RESPECTFULLY OF IT
HOW THAT BEAUTIFUL GIRL HAS THROWN HERSELF AWAY I THOUGHT
SO THAT MYSTERY WAS CLEARED UP
I WISH I KNEW MORE ABOUT THOSE PROUD FORLORN BEAUTIES WHOSE PORTRAITS ARE FADING ON THE WALLS
BUT LAST NIGHT HE HAD FRIGHTENED THEM SO POOR LITTLE MAN
BUT IT IS QUITE VAIN I KNOW SPEAKING TO YOU REALLY RADIE YOU'RE ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN A POOR FELLOW
DON'T ASK ME BUT LISTEN WONDER STRICKEN AND PAINED WAS THE COUNTENANCE WITH WHICH THE VICAR GAZED UPON HER AND DOLLY LOOKED BOTH FRIGHTENED AND PERPLEXED
I WISH WE COULD FIND ANOTHER--THE TRUE ONE IN THE PRESENT AND IN THE COMING TIME DORCAS SMILED FAINTLY AND I THINK THERE WAS A LITTLE GLEAM OF A GHASTLY SATIRE IN IT
HE HAD TWICE BEEN PUBLICLY COMPLIMENTED IN THIS SENSE WHEN MANAGING LORD HEDGEROW'S ESTATE
AND HE SAYS--HE SAYS--OH HERE'S THE LETTER AND YOU'LL SEE IT ALL THERE HE HANDED IT TO LAKE AND KEPT HIS EYE ON HIM WHILE HE READ IT
I'M SURE YOU WILL
A TALL GRAY STONE STANDS IN THE CENTRE OF THIS SPACE
YOU KNOW A FELLOW'S NEVER SATISFIED
HOW CHARMING THIS PLACE IS--THE TEMPLE OF FLORA AND YOU THE DIVINITY AND HE KISSED HER CHEEK
BUT DO YOU HAPPEN CAPTAIN LAKE TO KNOW OF ANY OF THOSE UNFORTUNATE THOSE MISERABLE CONNECTIONS WHICH YOUNG GENTLEMEN OF FASHION--EH
CHAPTER LVI
BUT IF STANLEY HAD ANY I CAN WELL IMAGINE WHAT TORTURE IT MUST HAVE ENDURED
AN OBSOLETE CHAMBERMAID HAD BEEN ALREADY INSTALLED AS NURSE
GIVE ME A GLASS OF WINE
I HAVE NO MORE INFLUENCE WITH HIM AND CAN NO MORE AFFECT HIS DOINGS OR WHAT YOU CALL HIS FATE_--AND TO SAY THE TRUTH CARE ABOUT THEM NO MORE THAN THE CHILD UNBORN
HE RATHER LIKED TALKING WITH PEOPLE
AND YOU MUST COME DOWN BY THE FIRST IF YOU CAN
HIS GRANDMOTHER HAD BEEN A HOWARD
PEOPLE OF ALL SORTS WERE COMING AND GOING AND BRANDON HALL WAS ALREADY GROWING LIKE AN INN
AND RACHEL MECHANICALLY AS STORY-TELLERS SAY PLACED HER SLENDER GLOVED HAND UPON HIS ARM--THE MISCREANT ARM THAT HAD BEEN SO NEARLY RAISED TO STRIKE HER
BUT YOU WILL MEET WITH MEN IN EVERY PROFESSION--AND MINE IS NO EXCEPTION--DISPOSED TO EXTRACT THE LAST FARTHING WHICH THE LAW BY ITS EXTREMEST PROCESS WILL GIVE THEM
THE MOMENT RACHEL SAW HER SHE DIVINED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND GLIDING OVER SHE PLACED HER ARM ROUND HER
CHAPTER LIII
DEAR LARKIN,--I READ A RUMOUR OF A DISSOLUTION DURING THE RECESS
BUT YOU SEE HOW IT IS
I SEE PEN AND INK ON THE TABLE THERE
FOR TO PREVENT YOUR CONJECTURAL INTERFERENCE FROM DOING HIM A MORE SERIOUS MISCHIEF I WILL NOW AND HERE IF YOU PLEASE DIVULGE THE TRUE AND ONLY CAUSE OF HIS ABSCONDING
LOOK AT SOMETHING ELSE CAN'T YOU
ON THE CONTRARY HER MIND WANDERED AWAY AND SHE FOUND HERSELF LISTENING EVERY NOW AND THEN AND AT LAST SHE FANCIED THAT OLD TAMAR ABOUT WHOM THAT DREAM AND HER UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE AT THE DOOR HAD GIVEN HER A SORT OF SPECTRAL FEELING THAT NIGHT WAS UP AND WATCHING HER
DISCHARGE LARKIN--FIGHT HIM--AND SEE US VALIANTLY STRIPT OF OUR PROPERTY BY SOME CURSED LAW-QUIBBLE
NOT BEING ABLE TO DISCOVER HIS TERMINAL SYLLABLE HE WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF STYLING HIM BY HIS SPRIGHTLY BEGINNING AND CALLING HIM SHORTLY LARK AS SIR J
BESIDES SHE WAS SURE HE WOULD RETURN--SHE COULD NOT TELL HOW SOON--AND ALTHOUGH THE CLUMP OF ALDERS HID HER FROM VIEW SHE COULD NOT TELL BUT THAT THE NEXT MOMENT WOULD DISCLOSE HIS FIGURE RETRACING HIS LEISURELY STEPS AND READY TO PURSUE AND OVERTAKE IF BY A PRECIPITATE MOVEMENT SHE HAD BETRAYED HER PRESENCE
MISS BRANDON SMILED FROM UNDER HER GIPSY-HAT VERY PLEASANTLY FOR HER
AND DON'T WRITE
HE WROTE WITH A STUPID GOOD-HUMOUR AND AN INSOLENT BREVITY WHICH TOOK NO ACCOUNT OF MISS BRANDON'S POSITION OR THAT THOUGH SECONDARY IN AWKWARDNESS OF HER NOBLE RELATIVES
SACRIFICED FOR HIM AND THAT SACRIFICE USED BY HIM TO TORTURE TO EXTORT PERHAPS TO RUIN
LITTLE FAIRY USED TO WALK WHEN PAROCHIAL VISITS WERE NOT VERY DISTANT WITH HIS WAPSIE HOW THAT NAME CAME ABOUT NO ONE REMEMBERED BUT THE VICAR ANSWERED TO IT MORE CHEERILY THAN TO ANY OTHER
AND NOW I'VE SAID ALL AND PRAY ASK ME NO MORE UPON THAT POINT RACHEL SPOKE WITH A HURRIED AND FIERCE IMPATIENCE THAT RATHER STARTLED HER COMPANION
BUT WE WILL BRING THEM TO PARTICULARS
BUT I MAY REPENT IT AFTERWARDS STANLEY YOU MAY REGRET POSTPONING IT MUCH MORE YOU HAVE NO IDEA RACHEL HOW VERY TIRESOME YOU'VE GROWN YES STANLEY I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND IT
HIS BOY INDEED WOULD TAKE AN ESTATE TAIL--AND COULD DISENTAIL WHENEVER--IF EVER--HE CAME OF AGE
AND THE DIRECT AND FIERY CHARGE OF HER KINSWOMAN WAS UNANSWERED
I'M SORRY I DID NOT TAKE YOUR ADVICE
RACHEL KNOWS ALL THIS
THE RENTAL IS FIVE THOUSAND A-YEAR AND SOME HUNDREDS AND THE RENTS CAN BE GOT UP A BIT--SO LARKIN TELLS ME
WE BEAT OFF THE DOGS AND ON RETURNING TO LAKE FOUND JEKYL TRYING TO RAISE HIM A LITTLE AGAINST A TREE
STOP WILLIAM WYLDER DON'T SIGN
AND IT WAS NOW DUSK THE SUN HAVING GONE DOWN DURING MY REVERIE
BUT I DO ASSURE YOU I WAS NOW IN AN EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT STATE
ANY SORT OF DEALING WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE SIMPLE VICAR
FOR ALTHOUGH STANLEY LAKE LOOKED VERY PALE AND VICIOUS AS HE WALKED DOWN TO THE IRON GATE OF THE LODGE AMONG THE EVERGREENS AND BASS-MATS THE GOOD ATTORNEY'S COUNTENANCE SHONE WITH A SERENE AND HEAVENLY LIGHT SO PURE AND BRIGHT INDEED THAT I ALMOST WONDER HIS DAZZLED SERVANTS SITTING ALONG THE WALL WHILE HE READ AND EXPOUNDED THAT MORNING DID NOT RESPECTFULLY PETITION THAT A VEIL AFTER THE MANNER OF MOSES MIGHT BE SUSPENDED OVER THE SERAPHIC EFFULGENCE
AND YOU'RE NOT AFRAID--YOU KNOW THE PLACE IS SO QUIET--OF THE LITTLE WALK BY YOURSELF
WE'LL FORGET IT
WE BOTH AGREED THAT YOU ARE TOO MUCH A RECLUSE IN THAT DER FRIESCHUTZ GLEN--AT LEAST FOR YOUR FRIENDS PLEASURE
SO THE VICAR'S PEN WAS APPLIED BUT BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO TRACE THE FIRST LETTER OF HIS NAME RACHEL LAKE RESOLUTELY SNATCHED THE THICK BLUISH SHEET OF SCRIVENERY WITH ITS HANDSOME MARGINS AND RED INK LINES FROM BEFORE HIM AND TORE IT ACROSS AND ACROSS WITH THE QUICKNESS OF TERROR AND IN FEWER SECONDS THAN ONE COULD FANCY IT LAY ABOUT THE FLOOR AND GRATE IN PIECES LITTLE BIGGER THAN DOMINOES
IT IS WHAT I CALL AN ACCURATE PORTRAIT BUT THAT IS ALL
AND--AND TO BEG THAT FLOWER'--AND HE PLUCKED IT RESOLUTELY FROM HER BOUQUET--'WHICH I WILL KEEP WHILE I LIVE
NO MASTER STANLEY
A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT HIS HEART IS NOT SET UPON THE THINGS OF THE WORLD
AND HE THAT HAD GATHERED LITTLE HAD NO LACK IT IS THE SAME EARTH FOR ALL
HE PURSUED HIS WAY WITH A VAGUE FEELING OF DANGER AND RAGE HAVING ENCOUNTERED AN OPPOSITION OF SO MUCH MORE ALARMING A CHARACTER THAN HE HAD ANTICIPATED AND FOUND HIS WIFE NOT ONLY COMPETENT FERRE ASPECTUM TO ENDURE HIS MANIACAL GLARE AND SCOWL BUT SERENELY TO DEFY HIS VIOLENCE AND HIS WRATH
WYLDER THOUGHT HIM A CLEVER MAN AND SO PERHAPS IN A CERTAIN SENSE HE WAS
YOUR SECRET IS SAFE AND RACHEL TRY TO LIKE ME I LOVE YOU BETTER DORCAS THAN I THOUGHT I EVER COULD
OF A BLOW OF THE PISTOL AND SO ON THE YOUNG NOBLEMAN GATHERING THE FACTS AS BEST HE MIGHT
VERY HONEST FELLOWS WITH GOOD LOOKING AFTER--EH THE ATTORNEY LAUGHED A LITTLE AWKWARDLY WITH HIS PRETTY PINK BLUSH OVER HIS LONG FACE
THE CARNIVAL OF VENICE WAS NOTHING LIKE SO GRAND AN EVENT
NOW YOU MUST NOT BE ANGRY
IF A WAFER HAD BEEN STUCK UPON MY FOREHEAD AND SHE HAD OBSERVED IT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUST THAT LOOK AND NO MORE
BUT STILL I'M PUZZLED
WHAT HAVE I HEARD--WHAT HAVE I ENDURED
THE SUN HAD JUST GONE DOWN
WHAT THE D HAS HE COME DOWN HERE FOR
BUT OF COURSE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO BE ARRANGED--SETTLEMENTS YOU KNOW--AND I CAN'T MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF THEIR LINGO AND A FELLOW DON'T LIKE TO SIGN AND SEAL HAND OVER HEAD--_YOU WOULD NOT ADVISE THAT YOU KNOW
THE CAPTAIN WAS RATHER A GOOD WHIP AND HE DROVE AT A GREAT PACE TO DOLLINGTON TOOK THE TRAIN ON TO CHARTERIS THERE POSTED HIS LETTER AND SO RETURNED
THERE CAN HARDLY BE A SECOND OPINION MISS BRANDON
I--I THINK MR LARKIN A VERY CUNNING PERSON
AND PRAY SIR HAVE YOU NO EVIDENCE IN THE LETTERS YOU SPEAK OF BUT THE INSERTION OF DATES AND THE POSTING THEM IN INVERSE ORDER TO LEAD YOU TO THAT STRONG CONCLUSION NONE AS SUPPLIED BY THE LETTERS THEMSELVES ANSWERED LARKIN A LITTLE DOGGEDLY AND I VENTURE TO THINK THAT IS RATHER STRONG QUITE SO TO A MIND LIKE YOURS SAID LAKE WITH A FAINT GLEAM OF HIS UNPLEASANT SMILE THROWN UPON THE FLOOR BUT OTHER MEN DON'T SEE IT
THE SAME PALE SMILE WAS THERE
IT WAS DESTINED TO ILLUSTRATE THE CORRESPONDENCE AND LARKIN SAT DOWN BEFORE IT AND SURVEYED WITH A SOLEMN STARE THE WIDE SCENE OF MARK WYLDER'S OPERATIONS AS A GENERAL WOULD THE THEATRE OF HIS RIVAL'S STRATEGY
AND HER THICK GAUNTLETS ON HER SLENDER HANDS
THEY ARE DETERMINED TO GO THROUGH WITH IT
SHALL I TAKE YOU TO THE SUPPER-ROOM NO STANLEY THANK YOU
HE HAD A RIGHT TO HIS PINT OF HIGH-PRICED WINE AND TO ACCOMPLISH HIS WANDERINGS IN A CAB INSTEAD OF AS THE ITALIANS SAY PARTLY ON FOOT AND PARTLY WALKING THEREFORE AND ON THIS PRINCIPLE MR JOS
AND I AM GLAD SAID RACHEL THAT I HAPPENED TO LIGHT ON YOU AND SHE PAUSED
AND PROBABLY EACH SAW GLIMMERING IN THE HORIZON THE GOLDEN ROUND OF A CORONET
BUT HE HAD COME TO HEAR THE DISTRESSES OF HIS CLIENTS AS TRANQUILLY AS DOCTORS DO THE PANGS OF THEIR PATIENTS
AND IF MISS BRANDON SENDS TO ASK ME TO THE HALL SAY I'VE A HEADACHE AND FEAR I CAN'T GO
AND I CAN'T SAY WITH WHAT FEAR AND HOPE I AWAIT WHAT YOU MAY SAY
WHAT CONFOUNDED NONSENSE
HOW FILMY THEY ARE
THOUGH NOT MUCH OF A SPORTSMAN LAKE LENT HIMSELF HANDSOMELY TO ALL THE SPORTING PROCEEDINGS OF THE COUNTY AND SUBSCRIBED IN A WAY WORTHY OF THE OLD RENOWN OF BRANDON HALL TO ALL SORTS OF CHARITIES AND GALAS
WHY CAPTAIN LAKE THE MATTER IS THIS--IT AMOUNTS IN FACT TO FRAUD
THE GREAT NIGHT HAD NOW ARRIVED
I DO NOT REPRESENT TO YOU HOW MUCH REASON EVERYONE INTERESTED BY RELATIONSHIP IN THAT YOUNG LADY HAS TO FEEL OFFENDED AT THE DISRESPECT WITH WHICH YOU HAVE TREATED HER
DO NOT SUPPOSE MY POOR BROTHER THAT I WRITE FROM IMPULSE--I HAVE DEEPLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT DEEPLY REPEATED STANLEY WITH A SNEER
IF THE MESSENGER CAUGHT THE QUARTER TO ELEVEN UP TRAIN AT DOLLINGTON HE WOULD BE IN LONDON AT SIX AND COULD RETURN WITH THE DOCTOR BY THE DOWN MAIL TRAIN AND SO REACH DOLLINGTON AT TEN MINUTES PAST FOUR NEXT MORNING WHICH WOULD ANSWER AS HE WOULD NOT OPERATE SOONER
SOME MEN WITH A PIERCING INSIGHT INTO THE EVIL OF MAN'S NATURE HAVE A BLURRED VISION FOR THEIR OWN MORALITIES
THEY'LL TAKE IT TO MEAN MORE THAN IT DOES AND YOU OUGHTN'T
I KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM
BUT LAKE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS ANNOYED AT HIS UNEXPLAINED ABSENCE
YOU'LL NOT MENTION IT AND I'LL HAVE A WORD WITH LAKE QUITE FRIENDLY OF COURSE
ANOTHER MAN MIGHT NOT HAVE COME HERE MR WYLDER UNTIL HIS PRESENCE HAD BEEN SPECIALLY INVITED AFTER THE--THE WHEN HE CAME TO DEFINE THE OFFENCE IT WAS NOT VERY EASY TO DO SO INASMUCH AS IT CONSISTED IN THE VICAR'S HAVING UNCONSCIOUSLY VERY NEARLY ESCAPED FROM HIS FANGS
MEN WHO BEAT ABOUT THE WORLD IN SHIPS USUALLY HAVE
I SAY I DO--(AND HE UTTERED AN UNPLEASANT EXCLAMATION DO YOU THINK I'LL LEAVE MATTERS TO TAKE THEIR COURSE AND SIT DOWN HERE TO BE DESTROYED
MARK WYLDER IS AS PROMPT AS YOU AND HAS TEN TIMES YOUR NERVE AND SENSE
AND THE DUSKY CRIMSON AND TARNISHED GOLD HAD GONE OUT OF VIEW TILL MORNING
IN MAKING THIS CHANGE IN HIS POSITION SLIGHT AS IT WAS THE GENTLEMAN IN THE SUPERFLUOUS CLOTHING REMINDED MR JOS
ONLY I THINK I HAVE PERHAPS A LITTLE MISTAKEN THE RELATION IN WHICH I STOOD AND FANCIED WRONGLY IT WAS IN THE LIGHT SOMEWHAT OF A FRIEND AS WELL AS OF A PROFESSIONAL ADVISER
THEY CAN READ THROUGH THE OUTER SKIN OF ORDINARY MEN AS THROUGH A PARCHMENT AGAINST THE LIGHT THE INNER WRITING AND SPELL OUT ITS MEANINGS
DON'T YOU THINK IT HAD BEST GO AT ONCE?--THERE MAY BE SOMETHING REQUIRING AN ANSWER AND YOUR POST LEAVES DOESN'T IT AT TWELVE OH
SHE ONLY LOOKED AT HER WITH A GOOD-HUMOURED BUT GRAVE CURIOSITY FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN SAID WITH RATHER A KINDLY SMILE AND NOW DORCAS I LIKE YOU DORCAS MADE NO ANSWER BUT PUT HER ARM ROUND RACHEL'S NECK AND KISSED HER
BUT SHE WAS SEATED CLOSE TO THE GROUND SEVERAL YARDS AWAY AND IN THE SHARP SHADOW OF THE OLD BLOCK OF STONE
YOU KNOW JOS
AND WAS LISTENING AND SILENT WHEN BUDDLE'S SHORT STEP AND SHORT RESPIRATION WERE HEARD IN THE PASSAGE
WHAT IF THAT MYSTERIOUS AND ALMOST ILLEGIBLE BRUTE JAMES DUTTON SHOULD ARRIVE WHILE HE WAS AWAY
IT IS REALLY NOT FAIR TO EXPECT YOU OR ME TO KEEP PEOPLE LIKE THAT SHE HAS NOT COST YOU MUCH HITHERTO STANLEY AND SHE WILL GIVE YOU VERY LITTLE TROUBLE HEREAFTER
I'M NOT A POET LIKE YOU--BOOK-LEARNED YOU KNOW
AND IF YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE SUCH A TRAGEDY FIGURE AND KEEP MOPING AND CRYING AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING AND LOOK SO FUNESTE AND MISERABLE YOU'LL BE SURE TO FIX ATTENTION AND SET THE WHOLE D--D PLACE SPECULATING AND GOSSIPING
IT IS NOT FOR THE CHILD I NURSED TO SAY THAT SAID TAMAR
AS IT IS I BEHOLD IN MYSELF AN ABYSS I GAZE DOWN AND LISTEN AND DISCOVER NEITHER LIGHT NOR HARMONY BUT THUNDERINGS AND LIGHTNINGS AND VOICES AND LAUGHTER AND A MEDLEY THAT DISMAYS ME
I DON'T THINK HE'S FIT FOR MANY THINGS
I MEAN I AM AT THE LADY'S DISPOSAL EITHER TO FULFIL MY ENGAGEMENT THE EARLIEST DAY I CAN OR TO BE TURNED ADRIFT
DITTO DITTO WITH CAPTAIN LAKE OF BRANDON
AFTER A STRUGGLE WITH THIS INFERNAL GAROTTER I SUCCEEDED IN AWAKING MYSELF
CHAPTER LXXII
YOU KNOW SIR SAID CAPTAIN LAKE BUT A LITTLE HUSKILY TURNING ABOUT AND SMILING AT LAST THAT MARK WYLDER IS NOTHING TO ME
INDEED I APPREHEND MY FRIENDS WILL HARDLY THINK ME JUSTIFIED IN OFFERING SO MUCH THE SEXTON WAS WALKING BACK AND FORWARD NEAR THE DOOR MAKING THE BEST CLATTER HE DECENTLY COULD AND WONDERING THE CAPTAIN AND LAWYER LARKIN COULD FIND NO BETTER PLACE TO TALK IN THAN THE CHURCH
IN HIS PRESENCE RELIGION IN THE VICAR'S MOUTH WAS AN IMPERTINENCE
AND LARCOM I THINK THOUGHT HE WAS THE DEVIL
THE SERVANT HELD THE PONIES HEADS AND MISS DORCAS PASSED THROUGH THE LITTLE GARDEN AND MET OLD TAMAR IN THE PORCH
LARK MAY THEREFORE TELL MARK IF HE SEES HIM OR HIS FRIENDS--MATTHEW LUKE AND JOHN--THAT SIR JULIUS SAW MARK ONLY ON TWO SUCCESSIVE DAYS AT THE CRICKET-MATCH PLAYED BETWEEN PAUL'S ELEVEN--THE COINCIDENCE IS REMARKABLE--AND THE ISHMAELITES THESE I AM BOUND TO OBSERVE WERE LITERALLY THE DESIGNATIONS OF THE OPPOSING SIDES
SO RACHEL SAT DOWN TO HER DESK AND BEGAN TO WRITE
AND LAST COMES IN OLD MAJOR JACKSON SMILING LARGELY SQUARING HIMSELF AND DOING HIS COURTESIES IN A FIRM BUT FLORID MILITARY STYLE AND PLAINLY PLEASED TO FIND HIMSELF IN GOOD COMPANY AND ON THE EVE OF A GOOD DINNER
IT IS MARVELLOUS IN A SMALL CONSTITUENCY OF 300 AVERAGE SOULS WHAT A QUEER MORAL RESULT ONE OF THESE BUSINESS-LIKE AND NARROW INVESTIGATIONS WHICH PRECEDE AN ELECTION WILL FURNISH
SOMETHING OF THIS I AM SURE APPEARED IN HIS COUNTENANCE AND CAPTAIN LAKE LOOKED AWFULLY SAVAGE AND EACH GENTLEMAN STARED THE OTHER FULL IN THE FACE WITH MORE FRANKNESS THAN BECAME TWO SUCH DIPLOMATISTS
YOU ARE NOT VEXED WITH ME
HE HAD A RIGHT TO A HANDSOME LUNCH AND A HANDSOME DINNER INSTEAD OF THAT ECONOMICAL FUSION OF BOTH MEALS INTO ONE AT A CHEAP EATING-HOUSE IN AN OUT-OF-THE-WAY QUARTER
AND HE MADE IT QUITE A LITTLE COUSINLY DUTY THAT I SHOULD SUCCEED AT THIS MOMENT MR PAGE INTERPOSED WITH THE ENERGETIC PRELUDE OF HIS CONCLUDING DITTY
AND HE SLID SIR JULIUS HOCKLEY'S PIECE OF RUBBISHY BANTER INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET AND THEN OPENED AND GLANCED AT HALF-A-DOZEN OTHER LETTERS IN A COOL QUICK OFFICIAL WAY ENDORSING A LITTLE NOTE ON THE BACK OF EACH WITH HIS GOLD PATENT PENCIL
DOES HE MEAN HE'LL BE HERE IN A WEEK OR ONLY TO HAVE THE PAPERS READY IN A WEEK ASKED LAKE
WYLDER'S HAND A NOVEL BY J
I CONTINUED GAZING ON THIS FIGURE WITH A DREADFUL INCREDULITY AND THE INDISTINCT FEELING THAT IT MUST BE AN ILLUSION--AND THAT IF I COULD ONLY WAKE UP COMPLETELY IT WOULD VANISH
YOU WON'T REFUSE ME DARLING
AND BECAUSE SHE CAN'T PERSUADE ME TO ACCEPT HER VIEWS OF WHAT IS CHRISTIAN AND SENSIBLE SHE THREATENS TO GO MAD--I THINK THAT IS HER PHRASE I DON'T THINK RACHEL IS A FOOL SAID DORCAS QUIETLY HER EYE STILL UPON STANLEY
NOT THAT SEAWORTHY FAITH WHICH FLOATS THE SPIRIT THROUGH THE STORM BUT FRAGMENTS OF ITS LONG-BURIED WRECK ROLLED UP FROM THE DEPTHS AND FLUNG MADLY ON THE HOWLING SHORE
AND IF HE DOES ONE OR OTHER MUST GO TO THE WALL
BUT SOMEHOW I SHOULD NOT HAVE LIKED TO BUY A HORSE FROM HIM
AND I THINK I HAVE SEEN HIM EVEN WHEN HE SMILED LOOK THE LEAST LITTLE BIT IN THE WORLD UNCOMFORTABLE AS IF HE DID NOT QUITE ENTER INTO THE CAPTAIN'S PLEASANTRIES
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THE POLTROON IN HIM AND HE WAS TREMBLING
IT WAS PLAIN YESTERDAY AT THE SESSIONS THAT INFERNAL WOMAN HIS WIFE HAD BEEN AT HIM
AND SO SOUGHT TO COERCE HIS SISTER RACHEL
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL IN NATURE PHYSICAL AND MORAL THAT HAD AS WELL NOT BE ASCERTAINED
OVID TELLS US IN HIS FASTI HOW STATUES SOMETIMES SURPRISED PEOPLE BY SPEAKING MORE FRANKLY AND TO THE PURPOSE EVEN THAN MISS BRANDON AND STRAIGHT WERE COLD CHISELLED MARBLE AGAIN
HE WAS TWISTING HIS NECK UNCOMFORTABLY IN HIS SHIRT COLLAR AND FOR SOME SECONDS WAS MORE AGITATED IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN HIS PATRON WAS

CHAPTER LXVII
AND YET SO GRUDGING WAS FATE HAD TO UNDERGO AN ENGAGEMENT OF NIGH THIRTY YEARS BEFORE HYMEN REWARDED THEIR CONSTANCY
HE SEEMED DISTRESSED BY THE NOISE
LARKIN WAS NOT QUITE IN A COMFORTABLE STATE AND HE RESOLVED TO GET THE DEEDS AND GO DOWN AGAIN TO THE VICAR'S AND PERSUADE HIM TO EXECUTE THEM
YOU THINK I NO LONGER LOVE YOU RACHEL AS I DID
AND THAT THE TOPIC OF THEIR CORRESPONDENCE WAS PERHAPS SOME COMPROMISE THE SUBJECT OR THE TERMS OF WHICH WOULD NOT BEAR THE LIGHT
BUT THIS WAS THE ONLY RUMOURED INCIDENT WHICH WOULD AT ALL HAVE PREPARED ONE FOR THE OCCURRENCE
WHAT HAD I BEST DO
NOT ASLEEP HE ENQUIRED STANDING BY THE BED
BUT ARE THERE NO CASTLES IN THE CLOUDS WHICH WE LIKE TO INHABIT ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THEM ALTOGETHER AIR-BUILT AND WHOSE EVAPORATION DESOLATES US
WHATEVER HIS MOTIVE--AND HE ALWAYS HAD A DISTINCT MOTIVE THOUGH SOMETIMES NOT EASILY DISCOVERABLE--HE WAS A GOOD DEAL ADDICTED NOW TO COMMENTING IN HIS CONFIDENTIAL TALK WITH RELIGIOUS GOSSIPS AND OTHERS UPON THE AWFUL STATE OF THE POOR VICAR'S AFFAIRS HIS INCONCEIVABLE PRODIGALITY THE UNACCOUNTABLE SUMS HE HAD MADE AWAY WITH AND HIS OWN ANXIETY TO HAND OVER THE DIRECTION OF SUCH A HOPELESS COMPLICATION OF DEBT AND ABDICATE IN FAVOUR OF ANY COMPETENT SKIPPER THE COMMAND OF THE WATER-LOGGED AND FOUNDERING SHIP
THE APPARITION WHATEVER IT WAS SEEMED TO PERSECUTE ME WITH A MYSTERIOUS OBSTINACY
HER KINSMAN LORD CHELFORD DID SO
JAMES CLUTTWORTH OR YOUNG LORD GRIDDLESTONE
IT WAS VERY DARK UNDER THOSE GREAT TREES
IT WOULD BE A VERY SERIOUS BLOW TO LOSE THIS
UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HIS PRIDE WOULD HAVE CONDEMNED THE VICAR TO A DIREFUL TERM OF SUSPENSE AND HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE PRETTY LITTLE GABLED HOUSE AT THE DOLLINGTON END OF THE TOWN FOR MANY DAYS TO COME
HE COULD NOT HOWEVER HAVE DOUBTED THAT HE WAS VERY NERVOUS--AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD OF THE COMPANIONSHIP EVEN OF ONE OF THE GYLINGDEN SHOPKEEPERS THROUGH THIS INFESTED BIT OF WOOD
WHEN HE SAW LARKIN THAT CONSCIENTIOUS GUARDIAN OF HIS CLIENT'S INTERESTS SCRUTINISED THE BILL OF COSTS VERY JEALOUSLY AND STRUCK OUT BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE POUNDS
I COULD POINT YOU OUT MANY PICTURES AND TELL YOU STORIES--MY COUSIN RACHEL KNOWS THEM ALL
THE MOONLIGHT SHINES THROUGH THEM AS THROUGH THE PHANTOM DANE IN RETZCH'S OUTLINES--COLOUR WITHOUT SUBSTANCE
AND IF YOU'LL BE A GOOD GIRL AND TRUST ME IN MATTERS OF BUSINESS STANLEY I TELL YOU PLAINLY ONCE MORE I NEVER WILL CONSENT TO SELL ONE ACRE OF THE BRANDON ESTATES THEN WE'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO WITHOUT YOU DORKIE HE SAID IN A PLEASANT MUSING WAY
BUT THE COMFORT WAS SADLY SPOKEN AND HE SIGHED
WAS SHE VERY WISE OR AT ALL LEARNED
HE MUST BE SAVED
I DREAMED MA'AM THE NIGHT BEFORE HE CAME A GREAT FELLOW WAS AT THE HALL-DOOR WHAT
EVERY FACULTY OF EYE HAND AND THOUGHT--HIS WHOLE HEART AND SOUL IN THE GAME
YOU HAVE HEARD OF COURSE OF MR WYLDER'S ABSENCE YES SOMETHING--_EVERYTHING SAID RACHEL HURRIEDLY LOOKING FROWNINGLY AT A FLOWER WHICH SHE WAS TWIRLING IN HER FINGERS
WHAT PRETTY LITTLE TEA-CUPS RADIE--QUITE CHARMING--OLD COCK CHINA ISN'T IT
OF COURSE ALL SORTS OF THEORIES WERE FLOATING IN HIS MIND
AND SHE GLANCED AT HIM ENQUIRINGLY
INTO THESE HE GOT AND NOW AND THEN BROUGHT OUT A LETTER BEARING ON SOME POINT OF SPECULATION AND READ IT THROUGH AND THEN CLOSED HIS EYES FOR THREE MINUTES AT A TIME AND THOUGHT
I CAN'T SUPPOSE IT
I WARNED YOU OF YOUR DANGER--YOU HAVE HAD THE WORST OF IT I SPOKE TO HIM
SIMPLY THAT HE WOULD HAVE HER TO BE NEITHER--BUT SCREENED AND PARTED WITH PRIVILY LET THE PHARISEES WHO WOULD HAVE SUMMUM JUS AGAINST THEIR NEIGHBOURS REMEMBER THAT GOD REGARDS THE TENDER AND COMPASSIONATE WHO FORBEARS ON OCCASION TO PUT THE LAW IN MOTION AS THE JUST MAN
HIS HANDKERCHIEF ALSO MARKED
AFTER A WHILE WITH TWO OR THREE GASPS SHE CAME TO HERSELF
WHEN HE WAS HERE LAST NIGHT THE LITTLE FELLOW'S PULSE WAS A HUNDRED AND FORTY-FOUR AND NOW DOWN TO NINETY-SEVEN
POOR TAMAR
THE FRIGHTLE MAN!--DON'T LET HIM--HE'LL HURT HER--THE FRIGHTLE MAN AND LITTLE MAN'S CHEEKS WERE DRENCHED IN TEARS AND HIS WEE FEET DANCED IN AN AGONY OF TERROR ON THE FLOOR AS BAWLING HE TRIED TO PULL HIS FRIEND RACHEL INTO A CORNER
AND INDEED THEY ARE A GOOD DEAL TOGETHER
AND I THINK THIS IS A HAUNTED GLEN--TREES FLOWERS ALL HAVE AN INTELLIGENCE AND A FEELING--AND I AM SURE YOU SEE WONDERFUL THINGS BY MOONLIGHT FROM YOUR WINDOW WITH A STRANGE MEANING ECHO THOSE WORDS RETURNED TO HER AFTERWARDS--'I'M SURE YOU SEE WONDERFUL THINGS BY MOONLIGHT FROM YOUR WINDOW BUT NO MATTER
AND TO THINK THAT ALL THE WHITE CITIZENS WERE ONCE MEN AND WOMEN MURMURED UNCLE LORNE WITH A SCOWL
IT CERTAINLY WAS AN AMAZING OUTRAGE UPON HIS SELF-ESTEEM THAT THE SECRET WHICH WAS THE WEAPON OF TERROR BY WHICH HE MEANT TO RULE HIS SISTER RACHEL SHOULD BY HER SLENDER HAND BE TAKEN SO EASILY FROM HIS GRASP AND LIFTED TO CRUSH HIM
I'VE WRITTEN TO HER TO COME
YOUR WAY OF SPEAKING OF MY COUSIN SIR IS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE DISCREDITABLE TO YOU AND OFFENSIVE TO ME AND SHOULD YOU VENTURE TO REPEAT IT I WILL CERTAINLY MENTION IT TO LADY CHELFORD AND SO SHE TURNED TO OLD MAJOR JACKSON AT HER RIGHT WHO HAD BEEN EXPOUNDING A POINT OF THE BATTLE OF VITTORIA TO LORD CHELFORD
I QUITE CONCEIVE BY WHOM I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SIR REPLIED MISS LAKE WITH GRAVE DISDAIN
SHE HAD A SPLENDID SHAWL OR TWO ABOUT HER AND A CERTAIN AIR OF DEMI-TOILETTE WHICH GAVE THE GYLINGDEN PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT HER LADYSHIP DID NOT LOOK ON THIS GALA IN THE LIGHT OF A REAL BALL BUT ONLY AS A SORT OF RUSTIC IMITATION--CURIOUS POSSIBLY AMUSING AND LIKE OTHER RURAL SPORTS DESERVING OF ENCOURAGEMENT FOR THE SAKE OF THE PEOPLE WHO MADE INNOCENT HOLIDAY THERE
SLIGHT GENTLE WITH SOMETHING OF A PALE AND STUDIOUS REFINEMENT IN HIS FACE
TOM WEALDON MYSELF AND TWO SCRIVENERS SQUEEZED INTO THE DOG-CART WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY JEKYL AND AWAY WE WENT
THEN AGAIN MARK--MARK--MARK AND THEN IT GREW MORE DISTANT AND SOUNDED AMONG THE TREES AND REVERBERATIONS OF THE GLEN LIKE LAUGHTER
I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE'S GONE NOR WHY IT'S A SECRET--I DON'T AND I'D RATHER NOT
THE PILOT LEAVES THE RUDDER AND LEANS OVER THE PROW AND LISTENS
THESE JEWELS ALL GO BACK TO MR WYLDER
AND FINALLY SHE PASSED INTO THE OLD WOMAN'S BED-CHAMBER WHOM SHE SAW HER WHITE HEAD UPON HER PILLOW DREAMING AGAIN PERHAPS
AND LET ME RECOMMEND YOU SEEING YOUR LEGAL ADVISER WHOEVER HE IS IMMEDIATELY YOU MEAN SAID THE VICAR WHO WAS BY THIS TIME VERY MUCH FLUSHED A GENTLEMAN OF YOUR PROFESSION MR LARKIN
HAD THERE BEEN LIGHT HIS PALE FACE WOULD HAVE SHOWN JUST THEN A MALIGN ANXIETY SUCH AS THE FACE OF AN ILL-CONDITIONED MAN MIGHT WEAR WHO APPREHENDS DANGER OF TREADING ON A SNAKE
THE MINISTER HIMSELF COULD NOT TELL WHETHER THE DISSOLUTION WAS AT HAND
SO SOON AS A CALAMITY IS WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THE BLOOD COMES UPON MY FOREHEAD AS THEY FOUND ME IN THE MORNING--IT IS A SIGN THE OLD MAN THEN DREW BACK SLOWLY AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE CURTAINS AT THE FOOT OF THE BED AND I SAW NO MORE OF HIM DURING THE REST OF THAT ODIOUS NIGHT
THEY HAVE THEM IN ALL THE CEMETERIES--I FORGOT THAT
AND LASTLY HE WAS NEVER MORE TO ADDRESS ANY ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO WERE PRESENT AT HIS DETECTION
BUT THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE LEARNED AND MR LARCOM RETURNED AND ATTENDED THE CAPTAIN VERY REVERENTIALLY AT HIS SOLITARY BREAKFAST
IT IS THE LOVELIEST TRAITS THAT REMAIN WITH US PERENNIALLY
HER FACE WAS IN SHADE AND ITS DELICATE CHISELLING WAS BROUGHT OUT IN SOFT REFLECTED LIGHTS
BUT LIVING I CANNOT ENDURE MY PRESENT STATE OF MIND LONGER
THANK DORCAS VERY MUCH FROM ME--THAT IS IF YOU REALLY MEAN THAT SHE ASKED ME I AM SO SORRY--I AM SO DISAPPOINTED SAID LORD CHELFORD LOOKING GRAVELY AND ENQUIRINGLY AT HER
HE IS ONE OF THOSE QUIXOTIC FELLOWS WHO GET ON VERY WELL IN FAIR WEATHER WHILE LIVING WITH A DUKE OR DUCHESS BUT ARE SURE TO RUN YOU INTO MISCHIEF WHEN THEY COME TO THE INNS AND HIGHWAYS OF COMMON LIFE
SHE DID NOT LIKE STANLEY'S STEALTHY VISITS TO REDMAN'S FARM
EVERYONE HAS EXPERIENCED I SUPPOSE FOR A FEW WONDERFUL MOMENTS NOW AND THEN A GLOW OF SEEMINGLY CAUSELESS HAPPINESS IN WHICH THE EARTH AND ITS PEOPLE ARE GLORIFIED--PEACE AND SUNLIGHT REST ON EVERYTHING--THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC AND LOVE IS IN THE AIR AND THE HEART ITSELF SINGS FOR JOY
AND LITTLE FAIRY WAS UP A GREAT DEAL TOO LATE
YOU HAVE NO IDEA DORCAS--NO ONE CAN--HOW TERRIFIC IT IS
AND WHEREVER HE IS I'LL FIND HIM OUT AND ACQUIT MYSELF WITH THE SCORN I OWE HIM OF ANY SHARE IN A PLOT SO UNSPEAKABLY MEAN AND ABSURD BRAVA BRAVA
I HAD INTENDED RESTORING THEM TO HIM
BUT ONLY A PART AND SOME CIRCUMSTANCES I DID INTENTIONALLY COLOUR A LITTLE
OH DEAR
MARK WYLDER'S SLAVE
TAMAR KNEW THE PATH VERY WELL
I MEAN OF THE--THE FAMILY ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH AS MR WYLDER'S FRIEND YOU SEEM TO TAKE AN INTEREST SHE SAID
IT MIGHT BE A GOAT A WHITE GOAT
IN WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE TAKES HIS HAT AND STICK
IN DUE TIME THE SAME FIGURE PASSING AT THE SAME RATE DID EMERGE AGAIN AND APPROACHED JUST AS BEFORE ONLY THIS TIME HE WAS CARELESSLY EXAMINING SOME SMALL BUT CLUMSY STEEL INSTRUMENT WHICH GLITTERED OCCASIONALLY IN THE LIGHT
WHAT YOU MENTION TO ME YOU KNOW AS A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY AND HOLDING AS I DO A CONFIDENTIAL POSITION--IN FACT A VERY CONFIDENTIAL ONE--ALIKE IN RELATION TO MR WYLDER AND TO THE FAMILY OF BRANDON HALL IS OF COURSE SACRED
WHAT ARE YOU STANDING THERE FOR SNARLED LAKE WITH A GLARE AT THE OLD MAN
HIS SURE INSTINCT TOLD HIM IT WAS A SECRET WELL WORTH MASTERING
IT IS TOO ABSURD REALLY THAT SUCH A MONSTROUS THING SHOULD BE ENFORCED
RACHEL WALKED ON SWIFTLY
AND OUR MARRIAGE IS FIXED FOR THE TWENTY-SECOND--JUST A FORTNIGHT HENCE
HIS ENQUIRIES ON THIS POINT WERE OF COURSE CONDUCTED WITH CAUTION AND REMOTENESS
LET ME IN HER FIRST IMPRESSION WHEN SHE SAW THIS PERSON CROSS THE LITTLE FENCE AT THE ROAD-SIDE WAS THAT MARK WYLDER WAS THE MAN
IT'S A HAND CRIED WEALDON WITH AN OATH
YOU MUST MARRY--YOU SHALL MARRY
IT IS PLAYING AT COSTS
AND HOW DO YOU DO MR LARCOM
HE DOES NOT KNOW NOR YOU NOR ANYONE
LONDON SHOUTED THE DOCTOR AS THE MAN TOUCHED HIS HAT IN PASSING
IN FACT LORD CHELFORD WHATEVER MIGHT BE HIS OPINION OF THE MOTIVES OF CAPTAIN LAKE AND THE PRUDENCE OF DORCAS WAS CLEARLY DISPOSED TO MAKE THE BEST OF THE INEVITABLE AND TO STAMP THE NEW BRANDON ALLIANCE WITH WHAT EVER RESPECTABILITY HIS FRANK RECOGNITION COULD GIVE IT
HE WAS A SPOILED BOY TOTALLY WITHOUT MORAL EDUCATION
ARE YOU ILL DARLING THOUGH SHE WAS WALKING ON BESIDE HER COMPANION RACHEL LOOKED ON THE POINT OF FAINTING
HE WAS LOOKING ON ME FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES AND SMILING IN A SLY RAKISH WAY THAT NO MAN LIKES IN ANOTHER
LARKIN'S SOUL SNEERED AT THIS PIECE OF STATE
BUT I WOULD NOT ACQUIESCE IN THE DOWAGER'S ABUSING MY CONCESSION TO THE PREJUDICE OF THAT BEAUTIFUL AND DARING YOUNG LADY--'I MEAN LADY CHELFORD IN DEFERENCE TO YOU WHO ARE NOT AWARE AS MISS BRANDON IS THAT I AM ONE OF MR WYLDER'S OLDEST AND MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS
THEY LAUGH AND THOUGH THEY DON'T CONVERSE THEY MAKE A CHEERFUL NOISE AND SHOW A CHEERFUL COUNTENANCE
BUT IF SHE DID NOT LIKE BRACTON VERY WELL INDEED SHE WOULD SEND HIM ABOUT HIS BUSINESS
BUT TOM WEALDON IT WAS KNOWN--AS THINGS ARE KNOWN WITHOUT EVIDENCE--WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THE CLEVER DODGES AND LONG-HEADED MANOEUVRES
YOUR HIDEOUS SLANDER IS GARNISHED WITH TWO OR THREE BITS OF TRUTH BUT ONLY THE MORE VILLAINOUS FOR THAT
THOUGH I HAVE SEEN WITH AN ASTONISHMENT THAT HAS NEVER SUBSIDED FELLOWS JUST AS OLD AND AS FAT AND BRACED UP BESIDES IN THE INFLEXIBILITIES OF REGIMENTALS KEEPING UP AT DOUBLE QUICK AT THE HEADS OF THEIR COMPANIES FOR A GOOD QUARTER OF A MILE BEFORE THE COLONEL ON HORSEBACK MERCIFULLY CALLED A HALT
YES I WAS WRONG
WHAT WAS IT
HE WAS REALLY A LITTLE TIRED OF ACTING SENTRY AND WAS VERY PEEVISH BY THE TIME THE RING OF WHEELS AND HORSE-HOOFS APPROACHING FROM THE LONDON DIRECTION BECAME AUDIBLE
AND THE PUBLISHERS SOMEHOW DID NOT TAKE KINDLY TO EUSEBIUS WHO WAS MAKING THE TOUR OF THAT FASTIDIOUS AND HARD-HEARTED FRATERNITY
AND HE HAD BEEN SEEN IN CONFERENCE WITH CAPTAIN LAKE AT A SUBSEQUENT HOUR AT BRANDON
AND WHAT CARE THEY FOR WRECK OR DROWNING I SUPPOSE IT WAS THE SAME SMILE
THE MOON WAS LOW AND ITS YELLOW DISK SEEMED AS IT SOMETIMES DOES DILATED TO A WONDROUS BREADTH AS ITS EDGE TOUCHED THE BLACK OUTLINE OF THE DISTANT WOODS
WILLIAM WYLDER IS DISTRESSED FOR MONEY
LARKIN I FANCY FOUND SOME SUCH SUBJECT OF CONTEMPLATION
YOUR DESPERATE AND INGRAINED PERVERSITY HAS RUINED US BOTH I WISH YOU'D LET ME KNOW MY OWN MIND
AND SO WITH HIS EYES LOWERED TO THE TABLE AT WHICH HE SAT GLANCING EVER AND ANON SIDEWAYS AT THE DOOR AND TRACING LITTLE FIGURES WITH THE TIP OF HIS FINGER UPON THE SHINING ROSEWOOD HE WENT ON MURMURING HIS STRANGE AND HATEFUL STORY IN THE EAR OF HIS WIFE
SHE HAD RAILED UPON WYLDER IN NO MEASURED TERMS HERSELF AND EVEN THREATENED AS THE PROPER MEASURE THAT VERY STEP WHICH DORCAS HAD ANNOUNCED
DINNER HAD BEEN A VERY DULL TETE-A-TETE
OF COURSE I DO NOT RECKON THOSE WHO ARE UNDER COMPULSION TO AFFECT PURITY OF MANNERS AND A HOLY INTEGRITY OF HEART--AND THERE ARE SUCH--BUT THOSE WHO VOLUNTEER AN EXTRAORDINARY PROFESSION OF HOLINESS BEING ALL THE WHILE CONSCIOUS VILLAINS
BETTER TO-DAY TAMAR ENQUIRED THIS GRAND AND BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY
THEN THERE WAS A PAUSE
I PERFECTLY KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT
STANLEY LAKE COULD BE VERY AMUSING
IN SMALL THINGS AS IN GREAT HE WAS PROSPEROUS
I SIMPLY ASKED HER WHAT SHE URGED YOU TO DO--I THINK I HAVE A CLAIM TO KNOW
OH FIT RETRIBUTION
AND THREE MINUTES AFTERWARDS HE HAD LEFT THE TOWN HALL
FOR I NEED NOT TELL YOU IN MY POSITION IT CAN'T BE PLEASANT TO BE DENIED ALL ACCESS TO THE CLIENT WHO HAS APPOINTED ME TO ACT FOR HIM NOR CONDUCIVE TO THE APPREHENSION OF HIS WISHES UPON MANY POINTS WHICH I SHOULD MUCH PREFER NOT BEING LEFT TO MY DISCRETION
HE SAT DOWN UNDER THE SHADE OF A KNOT OF BEECH TREES OVERLOOKING THAT ILL-OMENED TARN WHICH WE HAVE OFTEN MENTIONED UPON A LICHEN-STAINED ROCK HIS CHIN RESTING ON HIS CLENCHED HAND HIS ELBOW ON HIS KNEE AND THE HEEL OF HIS OTHER FOOT STAMPING OUT BITS OF THE SHORT GREEN SOD
BUT DON'T TALK THAT WAY TO ME AGAIN
I DON'T KNOW REALLY RADIE WHY YOU SHOULD TALK AS YOU DO
IT SAID PRIVATE REV
EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE SMOOTH ONLY FOR THAT D FELLOW
SHE LOOKED NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT BUT PASSED ON WITH INFLEXIBLE GAZE AND HASTY STEPS LIKE ONE WHO CROSSES A PLANK OVER SOME AWFUL CHASM
BUT YOU NEEDN'T FEAR ME MASTER STANLEY ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN A LITTLE STERNLY
I GOT INTO MY ROOM AGAIN AND SHUT THE DOOR WITH A CLAP THAT SOUNDED LOUDLY AND UNNATURALLY THROUGH THE DISMAL QUIET THAT SURROUNDED ME AND STOOD WITH MY HAND ON THE HANDLE WITH THE INSTINCT OF RESISTANCE
AND GET IT LOOKED AT FIRST THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL MORE BUT THESE WERE THE PASSAGES WHICH PERPLEXED LARKIN
HE WAS A LITTLE BIT STUNNED I THINK IN HIS NEW SITUATION
BUT KNOWING ALL I NOW DO I HOLD A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION--AND SO I THINK WILL YOU
THEY AND ALL THEIR HATED ASSOCIATIONS WOULD BE FAR BEHIND AND THAT AWFUL PAGE IN HER STORY NOT TORN OUT INDEED BUT GUMMED DOWN AS IT WERE AND NO LONGER GLARING AND GLOWERING IN HER EYES EVERY MOMENT OF HER WAKING LIFE
HOW COULD YOU--HOW COULD YOU STANLEY IT WAS A MISTAKE ALTOGETHER
AND IT STRIKES ME AS VERY CURIOUS YOU LIKE LIVING IN THIS REALLY VERY HUMILIATING STATE I DON'T INTEND TO GO OUT FOR A GOVERNESS IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN
I SEE VERY PLAINLY THAT HE SUSPECTS YOU AS I DO
BUT PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF IT SAID THE CAPTAIN THOUGH THAT'S NOT LIKELY NOT THAT I RECOLLECT CAPTAIN LAKE ANSWERED JOS
A SUCCESSFUL COUP MADE TOM WEALDON SPLIT WITH LAUGHING
AND I DO NOT THINK THAT MARK WYLDER WILL QUIETLY SUBMIT TO HIS DISAPPOINTMENT IT WAS TO HAVE BEEN SIMPLY A MARRIAGE OF TWO ESTATES
NONE IN LIFE MY DARLING AND THERE IS REALLY NO SECRET--NOTHING--_TELL YOUR WIFE--NOTHING YOU FEAR COMING TO LIGHT I SWEAR AGAIN NOTHING
THERE'S A PLEASANT SENSE OF ADVENTURE TOO IN THE MIDST OF YOUR SECLUSION
AND TALL BEAUTIFUL GRACEFUL IN RUSTLING SILKS SHE GLIDED INTO THE TINY DRAWING-ROOM SILENTLY AND SATE DOWN SOFTLY BY THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT UPON THE FLOWERS AND THE FALLING LEAVES MOTTLED IN LIGHT AND SHADOW
SHE ROSE
SHE HAD BEEN INVEIGHING AGAINST MISS BRANDON'S APATHY UNDER WYLDER'S DISRESPECT AND NOW THAT THE YOUNG LADY SPOKE AND ACTED TOO SHE WAS INCENSED
POOR CHILD
YOU'LL BE GLAD TO HEAR YOUR MISTRESS IS BETTER
YOU MUST NOT TRIFLE WITH THESE THINGS
AND TO THESE VOCAL EXERCISES OF THE FEASTERS RESPOND THE ENDLESS RING AND TINKLE OF KNIFE AND FORK ON CHINA PLATE AND THE MINISTERING ANGELS IN WHITE CHOKERS BEHIND THE CHAIRS THOSE MURMURED SOLICITATIONS WHICH HUM ROUND AND ROUND THE EARS OF THE REVELLERS
I DID NOT MEAN I ASSURE YOU
HE HAS NOT A TITLE AND HIS ESTATE IS NOT ENOUGH TO CARRY THE POINT A FORCE D'ARGENT
AND JEKYL WATCHING THE CATASTROPHE WAS VERY NEAR PULLING OUR HORSE OVER THE EDGE AND LAUNCHING US ALL TOGETHER LIKE THE CAPTAIN INTO THE DEFILE
AS AN ABSURDITY AND YET FRAUGHT WITH MISERABLE SUSPENSE AH DORCAS WHY WILL YOU MISCONSTRUE ME
ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT WYLDER WAS A FREE AGENT AND YET FOR PURPOSES OF SECRECY EMPLOYING ANOTHER PERSON TO POST HIS LETTERS AT VARIOUS CONTINENTAL TOWNS
BUT I MUST SEND A LINE TO OLD TAMAR
DON'T YOU THINK HE MIGHT TAKE STEPS TO RELIEVE HIMSELF CONSIDERABLY I DON'T SEE IT CAPTAIN LAKE SAID THE ATTORNEY SADLY AND DRILY
AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SCREAM OF THE ENGINE WAS HEARD PIERCING THE DEEP TATTING THE CYCLOPEAN RED LAMPS GLARED NEARER AND NEARER AND THE PALPITATING MONSTER SO STUPENDOUS AND SO DOCILE CAME SMOOTHLY TO A STAND-STILL BEFORE THE TRELLISWORK AND HOLLYHOCKS OF THAT PRETTY STATION
YOU SHALL DO IT--IMMEDIATELY TOO SHE STAMPED WILDLY AS SHE SAID IT AND IF YOU HESITATE STANLEY I SHALL BE COMPELLED TO SPEAK THOUGH THE THOUGHT OF IT MAKES ME ALMOST MAD WITH TERROR WHAT IS HE TO DO RACHEL SAID DORCAS STANDING NEAR THE DOOR
BUT SOMEHOW THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO LAKE TO SAY DO ALLOW ME THIS ONCE TO PRESCRIBE
BUT THAT WAS LONG AFTERWARDS
HIS LEFT ARM LIFTED AND HIS RIGHT HAND GRASPING THE HAFT OF A TABLE-KNIFE
POOR MARK THERE IS NO DOUBT SIR WHATSOEVER THAT HE IS PERFECTLY WELL
CAPTAIN LAKE WAS NOT GOING IN FOR THAT RACE
YOU ARE TO SUPPOSE THE CASE OF A GENTLEMAN WHO IS NURSING HIS ESTATE--YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS--AND WANTS TO TRAVEL AND KEEP QUITE QUIET AND WHO REQUIRES A STEADY TRUSTWORTHY MAN TO LOOK AFTER HIM IN SUCH A WAY AS I SHALL DIRECT WITH VERY LITTLE TROUBLE AND CAPITAL PAY
I WISH CAPTAIN LAKE TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK AND AS I SAID ABOVE-BOARD
IT WAS MUCH THE LONGEST HE HAD YET RECEIVED AND WAS IN THE NATURE OF A DESPATCH RATHER THAN OF THOSE SHORT NOTES IN WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO FOR THE MOST PART COMMUNICATED
HOW LONG YOU SAY WAS JACK'S SWORD
THAT IS ALL AND THAT IS EVERY THING IT HAD GROWN DARK WHILE STANLEY SAT IN THE LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM AND RACHEL STOOD ON HER DOORSTEP AND SAW HIS FIGURE GLIDE AWAY SLOWLY INTO THE THIN MIST AND SHADOW AND TURN UPWARD TO RETURN TO BRANDON BY THAT NARROW RAVINE WHERE THEY HAD HELD RENDEZVOUS WITH MARK WYLDER ON THAT ILL-OMENED NIGHT WHEN TROUBLE BEGAN FOR ALL
THE CAPTAIN AND THE ATTORNEY CONVERSE AMONG THE TOMBS
I'VE DONE WITH HIM NOW--_EMERITUS_--HE TOUCHES ME NO MORE
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
HE DID NOT WANT TO QUARREL--QUITE THE REVERSE
TAKE MY ARM
BUT REALLY I WAS NEARLY MAD WITH JEALOUSY AND SIMPLY DOING MY UTMOST TO DRIVE A RIVAL FROM YOUR PRESENCE
BUT THERE WAS A SILENCE AND DESERTION IN THIS PART OF THE MANSION WHICH SOMEHOW MADE ME FEEL THAT I WAS MYSELF A SOLITARY INTRUDER ON THIS LEVEL OF THE VAST OLD HOUSE
BUT NO IT COULD NOT BE
CHELFORD I RECOLLECT TOOK A BOOK AND READ TO US NOW AND THEN A SNATCH OF POETRY--I FORGET WHAT
BUT BE WARNED OR YOU'LL RUE IT WHY RADIE YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE WORLD
STANLEY LAKE HAD NOW NO IDEA THAT HIS INJURIES WERE DANGEROUS
RACHEL LAKE WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO NEVER LOSE THEIR PRESENCE OF MIND EVEN UNDER VIOLENT AGITATION FOR LONG AND WHO GENERALLY EVEN WHEN HIGHLY EXCITED SEE AND DO INSTINCTIVELY AND WITH DECISION WHAT IS BEST TO BE DONE
I THINK LADY CHELFORD AND HER SON BEGIN TO THINK THERE IS MORE IN THIS ODDLY-TIMED JOURNEY OF MR WYLDER'S THAN FIRST APPEARED
AND TELL ME DORCAS DOES HE KNOW THAT HE IS IN DANGER--SUCH IMMINENT DANGER THAT I CANNOT SAY RACHEL DEAR
ALL MEN ARE NOT LIKE YOU AND ME MY DEAR MR WYLDER
IN VIRTUE OF HIS RELATION TO MARK WYLDER AND OF HIS POSITION AS SOLE RESIDENT AND LEGAL PRACTITIONER HE WAS OBEYED
DORCAS THINKS--I'LL DO NO GOOD
NO--NOT THE LEAST DISTRESSED THAT I EVER HEARD OF LAUGHED STANLEY COLDLY--'ONLY JUST A LITTLE BIT ROGUISH MAYBE THAT'S SO LIKE YOU STANLEY SAID THE YOUNG LADY WITH A QUIET SCORN RESUMING HER ONWARD WALK
IT MIGHT BE ONLY THE LINES OF PAIN AND FATIGUE
HE COULD NOT GO OUT WITHOUT HIS LITTLE FAREWELL AT THE BED-SIDE AND HE WOULD BRING HIM IN SOME PRETTY FLOWERS
TURN OVER THE PAGES AND TRY TO FIND SOME PART WHICH SAYS WHERE SAFETY AND PEACE MAY BE FOUND AT ANY PRICE
YOU MUST TAKE IT RACHEL OR I'LL NOT GO STANLEY LAKE WAS SWEARING IN HIS LOW TONES LIKE A SWELL-MOBSMAN TO-NIGHT
HE COULD NOT DECIDE WHAT PRESENT USE TO MAKE OF IT NOR WHETHER TO MENTION IT TO CAPTAIN LAKE NOR IF HE DID SO HOW IT WAS BEST TO OPEN THE MATTER
IN THE MEANTIME RACHEL HAD ARRIVED AT BRANDON HALL
AND THIS LITTLE GARDEN COSTS I ASSURE YOU A GREAT DEAL OF WISE THOUGHT
FLOWERS LIKE FAIRIES HAVE THEIR FAVOURITES WHOM THEY SMILE ON AND OBEY
HIS HAT REMAINED ON HIS HEAD OVERSHADOWING HIS FACE
BUT I WOULD NOT PART WITH IT
LARKIN--HE NEVER SO MUCH AS DREAMED OF LOOKING FOR THEM THERE REMAIN HARDLY NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENT OF THE REVEREND MR WYLDER'S DEBTS--A SUM WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN AMPLE BEFORE THIS EXTRAORDINARY NEGOTIATION WAS COMMENCED TO HAVE EXTRICATED HIM FROM ALL HIS PRESSING DIFFICULTIES AND WHICH I WOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY TOO HAPPY AT BEING PERMITTED TO ADVANCE AND WHICH AND A GREAT DEAL MORE MISS LAKE WHOSE CONDUCT HAS BEEN MORE THAN KIND--QUITE NOBLE--WISHED TO PLACE IN YOUR CLIENT'S HANDS THAT SAID THE ATTORNEY FLUSHING A LITTLE I BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN TECHNICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
NO LARK BUT HONEST BUSINESS
SO YOU ARE GOING TO LONDON--_TO-MORROW IS NOT IT SAID CAPTAIN LAKE WHEN ON THE GREEN OF GYLINGDEN WHERE VISITORS WERE PROMENADING AND THE MILITIA BANDS PLAYING LUSTY POLKAS HE MET MR JOS
NEVER MIND WYLDER IT'S THE WINNING CARD SAID LORD CHELFORD LAYING HIS HAND ON HIS SHOULDER
MR LARKIN TOOK A TURN OR TWO UP AND DOWN THE ROOM THINKING
BUT BOYS HEAR OFTEN MORE THAN IS GOOD AND MORE THAN GOSPEL WHO LIVE IN SUCH HOUSES AS OLD GENERAL LAKE THE OLD MILLIONAIRE WIDOWER KEPT
GREAT DEBATE AND CONJECTURE IN THE READING-ROOM AND EVEN ON THE BENCHES OF THE BILLIARD-ROOM
DON'T YOU THINK PEOPLE HAVE EYES TO SEE AND EARS AND TONGUES IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
TRY AND GET TOM WEALDON
D HIM
I'LL DRINK TEA IN MY ROOM
WHY SHOULD SHE FEAR STANLEY OR WHAT COULD IT BE TO HER WHETHER HE WAS BESIDE HER IN HER HOMEWARD WALK
WHY IT'S NOTHING--I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY I THINK ABOUT IT AT ALL
AND I RELY ON YOU ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TO MAKE HIM UNDERTAKE IT
THE CONSCIOUS FRAILTY OF MORTALITY OWES THAT SAD REVERENCE TO ITSELF AND TO THE ESTEEM OF OTHERS
AND THE MASKS WHICH AN ELECTRIC GUST HAD DISPLACED FOR A MOMENT REVEALING GROSS AND SOMEWHAT REPULSIVE FEATURES WERE BEING READJUSTED WHILE EACH LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU DORKIE
AND SHE LIKED ME ONCE DEVILISH WELL I CAN TELL YOU
HE WAS NOT YET FEELING HIS WAY HE WAS ONLY PREPARING TO FEEL HIS WAY
AND WOULD NOT IT BE BETTER DEAR YOU WENT TO YOUR BED YOU RISE SO EARLY VERY TRUE GOOD OLD TAMAR BUT TO-NIGHT I MUST WRITE A LETTER--NOT A LONG ONE THOUGH--AND I ASSURE YOU I'M QUITE WELL
YOU TAKE A WONDERFULLY SERIOUS VIEW OF RACHEL'S NONSENSE I DO CERTAINLY YOU WOMEN HAVE A MARVELLOUS TALENT FOR MAKING MOUNTAINS OF MOLEHILLS--YOU AND RADIE ARE ADEPTS IN THE ART
WHO'S THAT SAID LAKE GRASPING HER WRIST
AND THE IDEA OF DISMEMBERING THE BRANDON INHERITANCE SEEMS TO ME LIKE TAKING A PLANK FROM A SHIP--ALL WILL GO DOWN WHEN THAT IS DONE BUT YOU CAN'T DISMEMBER IT
AND THINK WE OUGHT TO BE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE SO THAN IN THIS HOUSE ON THE TERMS OF A COMPROMISE WITH A TRAITOR LIKE LARKIN
THE REV
THE REV
AND SO WILLIAM WYLDER WAS VICAR NOW INSTEAD OF THAT STRAIGHT WIRY CLERIC OF THE MULBERRY FACE AND BLACK LEGGINGS
OUGHT TO BE A GOOD DEAL TO LAKE
HE WHISPERS A FEW WORDS NOW AND THEN--THAT IS ALL NOTHING TO CHELFORD--NOTHING PARTICULAR I MEAN NO--NOTHING--AT LEAST THAT I HAVE HEARD OF DID HE WISH TO SEE NO ONE NO ONE DEAR NOT POOR WILLIAM WYLDER NO DEAR
HE MIGHT ARRIVE ANY DAY OR NIGHT
I THINK IT WILL ALL DO VERY NICELY
SHE WAS SO INDESCRIBABLY HANDSOME--SO PASSIVELY DISDAINFUL
HIS THEORIES WERE BUILT CHIEFLY OF VAPOUR AND EVERY CHANGING LIGHT OR BREATH THEREFORE ALTERED THEIR COLOURING AND OUTLINES
WHAT A DREADFUL ONE MIGHT IT NOT PREPARE FOR DORCAS
BUT LARKIN HAS BEEN CORRESPONDING WITH MARK WYLDER UP TO A VERY LATE DAY AND IF THIS BODY HAS BEEN SO LONG BURIED HOW THE DEVIL CAN IT BE HE
FEW LIGHTS BURNED AFTER HALF-PAST TEN AND THE WHOLE VICINITY WAS DEEP IN ITS SLUMBERS BEFORE TWELVE O'CLOCK
NOW SIR HARRY'S RUDENESS TO LAKE HAD NOT BEEN I AM AFRAID ALTOGETHER ACCIDENTAL
NOW UNDERSTAND AT ONCE THAT I WON'T PERMIT THAT
NOW YOU SEE WHAT ART MAY DO
FOUL PLAY SIR FOUL PLAY--IS THERE
I KNOW IT
I KNOW IT
A GODDESS IN HER AERIAL PLACE HAUGHTY BEAUTIFUL UNCONSCIOUS OF HUMAN GAZE AND SEEN AS IT WERE TELESCOPICALLY BY MORTALS FROM BELOW
MISS RADIE DEAR,--IF COMING DOWN TO-NIGHT FROM BRANDON THIS IS TO TELL YOU IT IS AS MUCH AS YOUR LIFE IS WORTH TO PASS THE BLACKBERRY WALK ABOVE THE STEPS
A MOVE OF SOME SORT SUSPECTED--THE OPPOSITION PRINTS ALL HINTING AT TRICKS AND AMBUSCADES
SO I PAUSED
TALL BLACK-HAIRED--BUT A BLACKNESS WITH A DULL RICH SHADOW THROUGH IT
AT LEAST TO CONSIDER HE SAID SOMETHING
AND THAT'S THE REASON DEAR RADIE I CAN WALK ONLY A SHORT WAY WITH YOU
HE WAS DISMISSED IN A TEMPEST WITH COSTS
PALE LITTLE FAIRY SITTING BEFORE HIS PICTURE-BOOK WAS WATCHING THE SCENE WITH ROUND EYES AND ROUND MOUTH AND THAT MIXTURE OF INTEREST AWE AND DISTRESS WITH WHICH CHILDREN WITNESS THE UNCOMPREHENDED EXCITEMENT AND COLLISION OF THEIR ELDERS
SHE WAS STANDING IN THE PORCH OF HER TINY HOUSE AND OLD TAMAR WAS SITTING KNITTING ON THE BENCH CLOSE BY
WILLIE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU COULD NOT SEE HOW UGLY AND DULL YOUR POOR FOOLISH LITTLE WIFE WAS
I KNOW THERE ARE THINGS AGAINST ME--THERE ARE BETTER-LOOKING FELLOWS THAN I--AND--AND A GREAT MANY THINGS--AND I KNOW VERY WELL THAT YOU WILL JUDGE FOR YOURSELF--QUITE DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER GIRLS
AND IF I CAN FIND TIME I HOPE TO SEE HER TO-DAY
I HAD INTENDED LEAVING IT TO MY DEAR LITTLE MAN UP STAIRS
HE WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
HOLDING HER GLASSES TO HER EYES THE NOTE AT A DISTANCE AND HER HEAD RATHER BACK SHE SAID IT IS NOT A PRETTY BILLET AND SHE READ IN A SLOW AND GRIM WAY DEAR CHELFORD,--I'M CALLED UP TO LONDON JUST FOR A DAY
THE DOUBT DID NOT COME IN THESE DEFINED SHAPES
BUT HE DID NEITHER
HIS FACE COMES UP LIKE A WHITE FISH WITHIN A FATHOM OF THE TOP--IT MAKES ME LAUGH
BUT I DARE SAY THEY WERE IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE THEM FOR A DISSOLUTION WAS JUST THEN EXPECTED AND NO TIME WAS TO BE LOST
I ONLY ADVISE YOU
THE ENVELOPE BORE THE LONDON POSTMARK
BUT ALL WAS VAIN
SHE WOULD HAVE GLADLY CHOSEN ANOTHER SPOT TO REST IN BUT FATIGUE WAS IMPERIOUS
BUT THOUGH HE WAS BY COMPARISON EASY IN HIS COMPANY WITH EVEN A DASH OF FAMILIARITY HE STILL RESPECTED MR LARKIN AS A MAN WITH MONEY AND A SORT OF INFLUENCE AND IN WHOSE WAY AT ELECTION AND OTHER TIMES IT MIGHT LIE TO DO HIS HOUSE A GOOD OR AN ILL TURN
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE COMMITTED A MISTAKE--ANY MAN MAY
HAVE YOU REALLY COME ALL THIS WAY RACHEL TO SEE ME THIS EVENING SHE SAID AND SOMETHING OF SARCASM THRILLED IN THE COLD MUSICAL TONES
AND SHE ENJOINED UPON HER GIRLS THE PROPRIETY OF BEING SPECIALLY RESERVED IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH PERSONS OF LORD CHELFORD'S RANK
INDEED WHATEVER HAPPENS DEAR MISS LAKE MAY HEAVEN FOR EVER BLESS YOU
I DARE SAY EXACT AS IT IS IT WOULD GIVE TO ONE WHO HAD NOT SEEN HER A FALSE AS IT MUST AN INADEQUATE IDEA OF THE ORIGINAL
AND YET I'M GOING TO GIVE THE MOST DESPERATE PROOF OF LOVE THAT EVER SISTER GAVE--ALL FOR YOUR SAKE
SO HE RESOLVED TO LIE IN WAIT AND ANTICIPATE ANY NEW SUITOR WHO MIGHT APPEAR
AND I NEED NOT SAY YOU'LL BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO LET THAT GIRL OF YOURS HEAR ANYTHING
AND ALTOGETHER RACHEL WAS GLAD NOW THAT SHE HAD MADE THE EFFORT AND COME WITH HER COUSIN
LAKE HAD BEEN RAILING ON ALL THIS TIME AND HIS VOICE WHICH IN ILL-TEMPER WAS SINGULARLY BLEAK AND TERRIBLE WAS AGAIN IN HER EARS THE MOMENT SHE RECOVERED HER HEARING
AND HE HAS BEEN USEFUL TO ME
UPON MY HONOUR AND SOUL I KNOW NO MORE OF HIS MOVEMENTS PLANS OR MOTIVES THAN YOU DO
OH YES
OH YES
I FEAR THAT THE ARTICLES WERE SO ARTFULLY FRAMED BY HIS SOLICITORS IN ONE PARTICULAR WHICH IT NEVER ENTERED INTO MY MIND TO REFER TO ANYTHING LIKE TRICK OR DESIGN THAT WE SHALL FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPEL HIM TO CARRY OUT WHAT IN THE STRONGEST TERMS I HAVE REPRESENTED TO MESSRS
AND IF HE SHINES HERE IT IS ONLY IN REFLECTED LIGHT MARGERY CHILD FETCH ME THE SCISSORS AND A HOBBLE-DE-HOY OF A GIRL WITH ROUND EYES AND A LONG WHITE-APRON AND BARE ARMS CAME DOWN THE LITTLE WALK AND--EYEING THE PEER WITH AN AWFUL CURIOSITY--PRESENTED THE SHEARS TO THE CHARMING ATROPOS WHO CLIPPED OFF THE WITHERED BLOSSOMS THAT HAD BLOOMED THEIR HOUR AND WERE TO CUMBER THE STALK NO MORE
AND HIS THIN LITTLE LEGS WERE CLASPED ABOUT HER WAIST AND HIS ARMS ROUND HER NECK AND HE KISSED HER WITH HIS WET FACE DEVOURINGLY BLUBBERING THE FRIGHTLE MAN--YOU DOATIE!--THE FRIGHTLE MAN THEN MR WYLDER I SHALL HAVE THE DOCUMENT PREPARED AGAIN FROM THE DRAFT
I HAVE HAD I GRIEVE TO SAY BY THIS MORNING'S POST A MOST SERIOUS LETTER FROM LONDON THE ATTORNEY SHOOK HIS HEAD WHILE SEARCHING HIS POCKET
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS I'LL THINK AND THEN HE CLOSED HIS EYES
AND IF WE DON'T WE'RE BOTH RUINED HE SAID WITH A BLEAK OATH
DO COME IN--PRAY DO WAS HEARD IN DOLLY'S VOICE
IT IS NOTHING THAT MONEY CAN BUY OFF EASILY EITHER THOUGH HE DOES NOT LIKE PARTING WITH IT
LARKIN LOOKED DOWN ON THE SEEDY AND DISTRACTED VICAR FROM AN IMMENSE MORAL ELEVATION
I GOT UP AS QUICKLY AS MIGHT BE TO THE HIGHER GROUNDS AND WAITED THERE FOR AWHILE AND WATCHED FOR THE EMERGENCE OF THE OLD MAN
SO IF MONEY IS A ROOT OF EVIL THE WANT OF IT WITH DEBT IS ROOT AND STEM AND BRANCHES
YOU'D BETTER SEE LORD CHELFORD THIS MINUTE
I QUITE SO SAID THE CAPTAIN IN HIS SOFT LOW TONES
OF COURSE SHE HAS
CASH THE ENCLOSED ORDER FOR 150_L MORE FOR THE SAME STAKE
THE MAJOR SURPRISED DOCTOR BUDDLE SHAVING
YOU MUST PRAY FOR ME TAMAR
IN ANSWER TO THE ROARING SHIVER OF THE GONG WE ALL TROOPED AWAY TOGETHER TO LUNCHEON
HE CAN'T POSSIBLY WANT TO CONFUSE US UPON DATES AS WELL AS PLACES BECAUSE THAT WOULD SIMPLY RENDER HIS LETTERS FOR PURPOSES OF BUSINESS NUGATORY AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS HE WISHES ATTENDED TO JOS
I OFTEN WONDER HOW THE WYLDER COAT CAME IN THE CENTRE
HE STOOD ERECT
I SUPPOSE MISS PARTRIDGE WOULD HAVE HAD A PRECIOUS LOT OF BABBIES
THE GREAT WHISKERS
COMMITTED TO A DREADFUL GAME IN WHICH THE STAKES HAD COME TO EXCEED ANYTHING HIS WILDEST FEARS COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED FROM WHICH HE COULD NOT ACCORDING TO HIS OWN CANONS BY ANY IMAGINABLE MEANS RECEDE--_HERE WAS THE SPOT WHERE THE DREADFUL BATTLE HAD BEEN JOINED AND HIS COVENANT WITH FUTURITY SEALED
IT WAS A FRANK AND PASSIONATE DENIAL OF THE SLANDER BREATHING UNDEFINABLY BUT IRRESISTIBLY THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH
POOR MISERABLE LOST STANLEY IT WAS JUST A LOOK AND AN INARTICULATE CRY FOR MERCY
BUT HE COULD DO A HANDSOME AND GENEROUS THING FOR HIMSELF
I WAS ROMANTIC LIKE EVERY OTHER YOUNGISH FELLOW WHO IS NOT A PREMATURE CURMUDGEON
AND THE THIRD WAS WHETHER HE COULD COMMUNICATE ANY INFORMATION WHATSOEVER RESPECTING MR M.W.'S PRESENT PLACE OF ABODE
BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S COUNTENANCED HE'LL TRY TO GET THE START OF YOU
NATURE SUBSERVES THE MAJORITY
I DON'T KNOW ANY MAN SHREWDER
I SEE IT AT LAST
RACHEL THOUGH I KNOW HIM AND HIS WICKEDNESS AND AM FILLED WITH HORROR--I LOVE HIM DESPERATELY I AM VERY GLAD SAID RACHEL THAT YOU DO KNOW EVERYTHING
LARKIN CARRIED THE LAST CLOSE CONTEST AT DOLLINGTON BY A MAJORITY OF TWO HE KICKED THE CROWN OUT OF THE GRAVE ATTORNEY'S CHIMNEY-POT AND FLUNG HIS OWN WIDE-AWAKE INTO THE RIVER
THEN I AM TO UNDERSTAND MY LORD THAT I AM SUPERSEDED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS CASE SAID THE ATTORNEY AT LAST IN A MEASURED WAY WHICH SEEMED TO SAY YOU HAD BETTER THINK TWICE ON THIS POINT CERTAINLY MR LARKIN SAID THE VISCOUNT
GO BACK AGAIN--GO IN AND LOCK YOUR DOOR--WE'LL NOT GO TO HIM--_YOU NEED NOT YOU KNOW
HE HAD HOPES TOO OF ULTIMATELY CATCHING THE GOOD ATTORNEY NAPPING AND LEADING HIM TOO BOUND AND DOCILE INTO HIS ERGASTULUM ALTHOUGH HE WAS HIMSELF JUST NOW IN JEOPARDY FROM THAT QUARTER
PITY IT WON'T DO EVERYWHERE
I THINK RACHEL YOU HAVE A LOVER SHE SAID
THAT IS WHAT I COLLECT FROM IT HOW ON EARTH COULD THEY HAVE MISCALCULATED SO
ONLY HAVE PATIENCE JUST A MINUTE--AND GIVE ME A LITTLE WINE OR WATER--ANYTHING THERE IS THE KEY
AND MAKE YOUR MIND EASY ABOUT HIM
CONSOLIDATE ALL YOUR LIABILITIES AND KEEP A SUM IN HAND
LARKIN LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
BUDDLE HOWEVER THOUGHT THE CASE SO IMMINENT THAT ON HIS WAY TO THE BRANDON ARMS MEETING LARKIN GOING ATTENDED BY HIS CLERK AGAIN TO THE VICAR'S HOUSE HE STOPPED HIM FOR A MOMENT AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAD PASSED ADDING THAT LAKE WAS SO FRIGHTFULLY INJURED THAT HE MIGHT BEGIN TO SINK AT ANY MOMENT AND THAT BY NEXT EVENING AT ALL EVENTS HE MIGHT NOT BE IN A CONDITION TO MAKE A DEPOSITION
AND THE GREAT OLD HOUSE WAS PERFECTLY STILL
LISTEN TO ME GOOD AND KIND AS YOU ARE
COME STANLEY--FOR SHAME IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THEY WERE WALKING IN DEEP DARKNESS AND SILENCE SIDE BY SIDE ALONG THE PATH WHICH DIVERGING FROM THE MILL-ROAD PENETRATES THE COPPICE OF THAT SEQUESTERED GORGE ALONG THE BOTTOM OF WHICH FLOWS A TRIBUTARY BROOK THAT FINDS ITS WAY A LITTLE LOWER DOWN INTO THE MILL-STREAM
THAT LOW COARSE CREATURE MUST BE LOOKED UP SOMEHOW LAKE KNOWS WHERE HE IS LIKELY TO BE FOUND AND WILL SEE HIM I DARE SAY THIS EVENING--PERHAPS IN TIME TO WRITE BY TO-NIGHT'S POST SO IN A QUIET KEY MISS DORCAS BEING AT A DISTANCE THOUGH IN THE SAME ROOM THE DOWAGER AND HER SON DISCUSSED THIS UNPLEASANT AND VERY NERVOUS TOPIC
TAKE ONE OF MY HORSES STRAIGHTWAY WELL THOUGH THE BOOK IS LOST WE RETAIN THE MORAL YOU SEE SAID RACHEL WITH A LITTLE LAUGH
AND NOW REMEMBERING HOW THE BREAKING OF THAT SEAL RESEMBLED IN MY LIFE THE BREAKING OPEN OF A PORTAL THROUGH WHICH I ENTERED A LABYRINTH OR RATHER A CATACOMB WHERE FOR MANY DAYS I GROPED AND STUMBLED LOOKING FOR LIGHT AND WAS IN A MANNER LOST HEARING STRANGE SOUNDS WITNESSING IMPERFECTLY STRANGE SIGHTS AND AT LAST ARRIVING AT A DREADFUL CHAMBER--A SAD SORT OF SUPERSTITION STEALS OVER ME
AND STANLEY SHE ADDED IN A WHISPER LOOKING FULL IN HIS EYES WHICH WERE RAISED FOR A MOMENT TO HERS IT IS HARDLY CREDIBLE THAT YOU DARE STILL TO PERSIST IN SO DESPERATE AND CRUEL A PROJECT THANK YOU SAID STANLEY QUIETLY BUT THE YELLOW LIGHTS GLARED FIERCELY FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND WERE THEN LOWERED INSTANTLY TO THE FLOOR
YES SHE MUST BE QUITE GROWN UP BY THIS TIME--FIVE YEARS--SHE PROMISED TO BE PRETTY
HE WALKED UNDER THE SOLEMN TREES--THE SAME UNDER WHOSE AIRY GROYNING WYLDER AND LAKE HAD WALKED AWAY TOGETHER ON THAT NOTEWORTHY NIGHT ON WHICH MARK HAD LAST TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE GRAND OLD GABLES AND TWISTED CHIMNEYS OF BRANDON HALL
AND WYLDER'S CONFUSION ABOUT CAPTAIN LAKE--WHAT WAS THAT
SO I'VE HEARD IT ALL--AND THOUGH I MAYN'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE INS AND OUTS ON'T I KNOW IT WELL IN THE MAIN
BUT THEY STILL EXPRESS THEMSELVES DISSATISFIED UPON THE POINT AND APPEAR TO SUSPECT A DISPOSITION TO SHILLY-SHALLY I HAVE SAID ALL I COULD TO DISABUSE THEM OF THE UNPLEASANT PREJUDICE
WHAT HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE
BUT IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THE GOVERNMENT MAY WIN--A WEEK AGO THEY RECKONED UPON ELEVEN AND AS WE WERE TALKING THE POST ARRIVED
SOMETHING OF PANIC OR HORROR RELIEVED SOMETIMES BY A GUSH OF TEARS--SOMETIMES MORE SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY SUBSIDING WITHOUT THAT HYSTERICAL ESCAPE
I ASSURE YOU DEAR MISS LAKE WE HAVE NOT ACTED INCONSIDERATELY--NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE WITHOUT CAREFUL AND DEEP CONSIDERATION YOU MUST EMPLOY AN ABLE ATTORNEY IMMEDIATELY
I KNOW PERFECTLY HE WOULD PROTEST AGAINST A COMPROMISE
IT IS BUT A SHORT TIME WE HAVE TO LOVE AND BE JEALOUS AND LOVE AGAIN
MARK WYLDER HE KNEW CARRIED PISTOLS AND ALL THINGS CONSIDERED HE THOUGHT IT JUST POSSIBLE HE MIGHT USE THEM
WELL I HOPE SO SHE SAID AT LAST WITH A SIGH AND A SLIGHT SENSE OF RELIEF
EQUALLY DISTRACTING EMACIATING AND GODLESS WAS THE CONDITION TO WHICH THE MERE ADVENT OF THIS FESTIVAL REDUCED WORTHY MISS WILLIAMS THE DRESSMAKER WHO HAD MORE WHITE MUSLIN AND YOUNG LADIES ON HER HANDS THAN SHE AND HER CHOIR OF NEEDLE-WOMEN KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH
THERE WAS A TWITTERING OF SMALL BIRDS AMONG THE BROWN LEAVES AND IVY AND A THOUSAND OTHER PLEASANT SOUNDS AND SIGHTS STIRRING IN THE SHARP SUNNY AIR
I DARE SAY THE CAPTAIN FELT HIS GAZE UPON HIM AND HE UNDOUBTEDLY HEARD HIS EMPHASIS BUT HE PLAINLY DID NOT TAKE EITHER TO HIMSELF
I HAD NEVER BEEN QUITE SUCH AN ASS BEFORE
NEITHER WOULD MESSRS
MAJOR JACKSON--WHO SHALL NEVER ENTER THESE DOORS AGAIN--FOR HE WAS EMPLOYED--TRUSTED IN THEIR BRUTAL PLANS
THE LEFT HAND ON WHICH WAS THE RING OF THE PERSIAN MAGICIAN WAS BARE
LIKE MOST RUSTIC COMMUNITIES GYLINGDEN AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD WERE EARLY IN BED
TAMAR HE'S KILLED--STANLEY'S KILLED--I'M SURE HE'S KILLED AND ALL'S DISCOVERED'--AND RACHEL RAN WILDLY UP THE HILL A FEW STEPS BUT STOPPED AND RETURNED AS SWIFTLY
HE THEREFORE READ WHAT HIS GAZETTEER HAD TO SAY ABOUT THESE TOWNS AND CITIES STANDING FOR BETTER LIGHT AT THE WINDOW
I'M SORRY BUT I COULD NOT TELL THERE WAS SUCH A DEVIL ON THE EARTH YES I TOLD YOU SO
TO EXAMINE AND APPROVE
AND AWAY ROLLED THE BROUGHAM WITH THE TWO LADIES AND CHELFORD AND THE VICAR WENT IN AND MARK HURLED THE STUMP OF HIS CHEROOT AT FORTUNE AND DELIVERED A FRAGMENTARY SOLILOQUY THROUGH HIS TEETH
RACHEL DEAR I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU SAID DORCAS PLACING HER ARMS GENTLY ABOUT HER NECK AND KISSING HER TWICE OR THRICE
THANK YOU DEAR VERY MUCH
I DO NOT KNOW HOW LATE TOM WEALDON AND STANLEY LAKE SAT UP OVER THEIR LISTS
ALTHOUGH THE MARRIAGE WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE STRICTLY PRIVATE--NONE BUT THE IMMEDIATE RELATIONS OF THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM BEING PRESENT--THE BELLS OF GYLINGDEN RANG OUT MERRY PEALS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THE TOWN WAS TASTEFULLY DECORATED WITH FLAGS AND BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AT NIGHT
THE POST'S IN AT DOLLINGTON FIFTY MINUTES BEFORE WE GET OUR LETTERS HERE
AT FIVE O'CLOCK--IT WAS DARK NOW--THERE WAS A TREAD ON THE DOOR-STEPS AND A DOUBLE TATTOO AT THE TINY KNOCKER
AND YOU THINK IN HIS PRESENT SITUATION ABOUT TO MARRY DORCAS YOU CAN USE ME FOR THE PURPOSE
ONE WOMAN CAN ALWAYS INFLUENCE ANOTHER AND YOU ARE CONSTANTLY WITH DORCAS
THERE ARE MEN TO WHOM THE BUSINESS OF ELECTIONS--A LIFE OF SECRECY EXCITEMENT SPECULATION AND COMBAT--HAS ALL BUT IRRESISTIBLE CHARMS
I WOULD TRY DOLLY TO BE OF USE
ALL THESE INTERRUPTIONS WERE QUIET NOW AND ALTOGETHER GONE--'LITTLE MAN
WHATEVER HIS MEANS ARE THEY HARDLY SUFFICE FOR HIS PERSONAL EXPENSES--INDEED THEY DON'T SUFFICE FOR I HAVE HAD TO HELP HIM
NEVER OBJECTED TO A LARK THE GENTLEMAN SO DESIGNATED INTRODUCES HIMSELF WITH A STRONG PREJUDICE IN SIR J.'S MIND IN HIS FAVOUR--SO MUCH SO THAT BY WAY OF A LARK SIR J
YOU LOVE FLOWERS DORKIE
WHY DO YOU TALK THAT WAY
THEN IT IS PLAIN SIR I MUST HEAR YOU TO-NIGHT SAID MISS LAKE HAUGHTILY
BUT THE RECEIVER OF THIS RICH AND PEERLESS GIFT--LIKE SOME MYSTERIOUS KNIGHT WHO HAVING CARRIED ALL BEFORE HIM IN THE TOURNEY VANISHES NO ONE KNOWS WHITHER WHEN THE PRIZE IS ABOUT TO BE BESTOWED AND WHOM THE SUMMONS OF THE HERALD AND THE CALL OF THE TRUMPET FOLLOW IN VAIN--HAD ESCAPED THEM
ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS TO OBSERVE WHETHER SHE OR THE GIRL WAS LISTENING
I WONDER WHAT THEY'LL THINK OF IT AT BRANDON SAID THE ATTORNEY WITH A CAVERNOUS GRIN OF SLY ENQUIRY AT HIS COMPANION WHICH RECOLLECTING HIS CHARACTER HE SOFTENED INTO A SAD SORT OF SMILE AND ADDED NO HARM I DARE SAY
AND NOW MR LARKIN YOU'LL ADMIT I THINK THAT I'VE EXHIBITED NO ILL-TEMPER MUCH LESS VIOLENCE UNDER THE PROVOCATION OF THAT NOTE CERTAINLY
AFTER MANY DEVIOUS WANDERINGS I FOUND UNDER SHELTER OF A WONDERFUL LITTLE HOLLOW IN WHICH LAY DIM AND STILL A TARN REFLECTING THE STEMS OF THE TREES THAT ROSE FROM ITS EDGE IN A WAY SO CLEAR AND BEAUTIFUL THAT WITH A SMILE AND A SIGH I SAT MYSELF DOWN UPON A ROCK AMONG THE FERNS AND FELL INTO A REVERIE
3
NO NO
I SHOULD AT ANY TIME BE MOST HAPPY TO ADVISE YOU SAID MR LARKIN WITH A LOFTY AND PLEASED BENEVOLENCE AND WITH GREAT PLEASURE PROVISIONALLY UNTIL WE CAN HIT UPON A SATISFACTORY SOLICITOR WITH A LITTLE MORE TIME AT HIS DISPOSAL I UNDERTAKE THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR CASE THANK HEAVEN AGAIN SAID THE VICAR WHO HAD NOT LET GO HIS HANDS
STOP THIS STUFF
AYE I DARE SAY DEEP ENOUGH AND INTIMATE WITH THE LAKES
PERHAPS I DO WORSHIP
THE LITTLE SCENE TOOK PLACE CLOSE TO HER CHAIR
I DON'T BELIEVE DOCTORS LIKE TO TELL THEIR PATIENTS SO THERE WAS A SILENCE OF SOME MINUTES AND RACHEL CLASPING HER HANDS IN AN AGONY SAID OH YES--HE'S GONE--HE'S CERTAINLY GONE
AND THEN SHE BURST INTO SOBS AND AN AGONY OF TEARS
SHE IS AT HOME IS SHE YES SIR VERY WELL
OLD LADY CHELFORD'S BITTER AND OMINOUS ACQUIESCENCE ALSO CAME AND THE PRESENCE OF MOTHER AND SON AT THE SOLEMNITY AVERTED THE FAMILY SCANDAL WHICH THE OLD LADY'S FIRST ACCESS OF FRENZY THREATENED
IT WILL BE AN EVIL DAY FOR YOU DORKIE WHEN YOU QUARREL WITH ME HE LOOKED STEADILY ON HER SMILING FOR A SECOND OR TWO MORE AND THEN GLIDED FROM THE CONSERVATORY
THE DULHAMPTONS HAVE ARRIVED
AND I THINK I KNEW ALMOST BEFORE THEY SUSPECTED IT THAT THEIR GENEROUS INTERFERENCE WAS ALTOGETHER DUE TO ONE FINE PAIR OF EYES AND A PRETTY TOURNURE IN THE DISTRESSED FAMILY CIRCLE
SIT DOWN AND LOOK AT YOUR BOOK BUT RACHEL WITH A SMILE OF LOVE AND GRATIFICATION LIFTED THE LITTLE MAN UP IN HER ARMS AND KISSED HIM
DORCAS HAD TOLD HIM ALSO THE STORY OF RACHEL'S DECIDED OPPOSITION TO THE MARRIAGE
AND THE THIRD OBEDIENCE WHICH SPRINGS FROM THEM OLD LADY CHELFORD COUGHED AND THEN RALLYING SAID VERY GOOD MISS AND PRAY LADY CHELFORD WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MR MARK WYLDER PURSUED MISS DORCAS
AND NOW SHE BECAME ALL AT ONCE THE APOLOGIST OF THIS INSOLENT TRUANT AND WAS READY TO DENOUNCE HER UNREASONABLE IRRITATION
THESE FRANK PEOPLE ARE A SORE PUZZLE TO GENTLEMEN OF LAWYER LARKIN'S QUAINT AND SAGACIOUS TURN OF MIND
INDEED HE HAD GROWN UNDER THIS URGENT PRESSURE AS NERVOUSLY ANXIOUS TO SELL AS HE HAD BEEN TO RETAIN IT
WHO ARE YOU SAID LORD CHELFORD
LIKE YOU I DO NOT DESIRE TO SPECULATE AS TO THE CAUSES OF WYLDER'S EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT
AND INDEED THERE WAS AN INSUBORDINATE AND FIERY SPIRIT IN THAT YOUNG LADY WHICH WOULD HAVE BROOKED NOTHING LESS AND DREAMED OF NOTHING BUT EQUALITY
THERE WAS A SUSPICION OF A SNEER--NOT IN HIS COUNTENANCE NOT IN HIS TONE NOT NECESSARILY IN HIS WORDS--BUT SOMEHOW A SUSPICION WHICH STUNG THE ATTORNEY LIKE A CERTAINTY AND A PINKISH FLUSH TINGED HIS FOREHEAD
I AM MORE LIKELY TO TURN INTO A LADY MACBETH THAN A DEVOTE SAID SHE COLDLY WITH THE SAME PAINFUL SMILE
IT IS A DREADFUL WORLD SO IT IS MISS RADIE ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN HER GLITTERING EYES RETURNING HER SAD GAZE WOFULLY
OF COURSE BUDDLE COULD NOT GIVE ANY SORT OF OPINION UPON A CASE WHICH HE HAD NOT SEEN
AND WORSE THAN THAT WICKED OLD MAN
HE WAS NEVER TO PLAY ANY GAME OF CARDS AGAIN
I ALLOW YOU MIGHT DO MUCH BETTER THAN MARK WYLDER BUT ALSO WORSE
BESIDES IT WAS EVEN IF CHELFORD WERE AT HER FEET A WILD IMPOSSIBILITY NOW
AND YOU KNOW WE MAY ANY DAY HEAR FROM YOUR BROTHER DIRECTING THE LOAN TO BE PAID OVER TO YOU
LORD CHELFORD TOO HAVING LOOKED ON LAKE WITH SILENT BUT AWFUL MISGIVINGS LONGED FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE DOCTOR
WHEREFORE HE WHO KNEW ALL THINGS IN DESCRIBING THE THORNS WHICH CHOKE THE WORD PLACES THE CARES OF THIS WORLD FIRST AND AFTER THEM THE DECEITFULNESS OF RICHES AND THE LUSTS OF OTHER THINGS
LESS THAN FIFTY POUNDS WOULD NOT DO
OLD TAMAR ROSE UP AFFRIGHTED HER STIFF ARMS RAISED AND UTTERED A BLESSING
THEY SEEMED MADE FOR ONE ANOTHER
SHE HAS SOME AVERSIONS BUT NO QUARRELS
IS IT NOT SO SO SOON AFTER MY LITTLE ESCAPADE I DID NOT LIKE THE QUESTION
THE SEED OF THE WORD IS RECEIVED AT LENGTH INTO GOOD GROUND
YOU LOOK AT ME RADIE AS IF I WERE A MONSTER--OR MONSTRESS I SHOULD SAY--WHEREAS I AM ONLY A BRANDON
I DON'T THINK HE BELIEVED SO HIMSELF THEN
AND POOR LITTLE MRS WILLIAM WYLDER WHO KNEW NOT THE REASON OF HIS VISITS FELL SLOWLY AND TO THE GOOD MAN'S ENTIRE BEWILDERMENT INTO A CHRONIC JEALOUSY
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE PURSUED THIS FIGURE BUT ALWAYS LOST IT IN THE SAME PASSAGE
BUT I REGRET TO SAY MY HOPES HAVE VERY MUCH DECLINED AND I BEGIN TO THINK HE MUST HAVE CHANGED HIS QUARTERS
ANY OF THE COUNTY PEOPLE YOU MEET TELL THEM I'M MAKING A LITTLE EXCURSION ON THE CONTINENT
I HAD THEN BEEN HIS WORKING JUNIOR IN THE CAUSE OF WYLDER V TRUSTEES OF BRANDON MINOR--DORCAS BRANDON HIS OWN COUSIN
PERSONS LIKE LARCOM DO MAKE SUCH ABSURD BLUNDERS AND SO MISAPPREHEND THE CONVERSATION OF EDUCATED PEOPLE
WHAT A FOOL I'VE BEEN
HE HAD ALWAYS PREDICTED THAT MARK MUST BECOME VERY RICH AND THAT NOTHING BUT INDOLENCE COULD PREVENT HIS ULTIMATELY BECOMING A VERY GREAT MAN
THE SAME QUERIES WERE PUT IN A SOMEWHAT HAUGHTY AND PEREMPTORY WAY TO THE SPORTING HOTEL-KEEPER WHO ANSWERED THAT MR MARK WYLDER HAD BEEN STAYING FOR A WEEK AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT FIVE MONTHS AGO
SHE WENT OUT QUICKLY TO GREET HIM
I REPEAT THEREFORE STANLEY THAT DORCAS MUST KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH
BUT I AM QUITE WELL AGAIN
DOES HE SAY ANYTHING NO
NEXT MORNING STANLEY LAKE AT BREAKFAST WITH THE LAWYER SAID A PRETTY ROOM THIS IS
AFTER HER FIRST SHOCK ALL HER TERRORS WERE CONCENTRATED ON THE ONE POINT--STANLEY'S IMMINENT DANGER
I'LL COME BACK WHEN I HEAR THE CARRIAGE AND SEE YOU FOR A MOMENT AS YOU WON'T STAY OR COME WITH ME AND BID YOU GOOD-BYE SO DORCAS WENT HER WAY
THE LANGUAGE WAS QUITE EXPLICIT--THERE WAS NO WAY OUT OF IT
FOR IN THOSE DAYS I WAS A LITTLE SHY
SIR HARRY BRACTON'S INVASION OF GYLINGDEN
FROM THE WINDOWS THE CAPTAIN THUS SUPPORTED WAS TO MAKE HIS MAIDEN SPEECH ONE POINT IN WHICH TOM WEALDON INSISTED UPON AND THAT WAS AN INJUNCTION TO THE MEN OF GYLINGDEN ON NO ACCOUNT TO BREAK THE PEACE
AND NOW DEAR CHARLIE YOU HAVE IT ALL
WHAT CAN SHE SEE IN HIM
MACKLESTON-ON-THE-MOOR HOWEVER AND THE GREAT BARNFORD ESTATE WERE UNAFFECTED BY THESE LIMITATIONS
IN MY SHIRT CANDLE IN HAND I LOOKED OUT INTO THE PASSAGE
IT IS AN OLD LEGEND OF THE VENETIAN GLASS--ITS SHIVERING AT TOUCH OF POISON
THE CAPTAIN'S LIPS MOVED A DISCLAIMER I SUPPOSE BUT NO SOUND CAME
I WAS DREAMING WHEN YOU CAME IN
ELEVEN MINUTES PAST THREE SAID HE AND I'VE A MEETING AT MY HOUSE AT HALF-PAST
COME IN SAID MISS BRANDON
NEARLY TEN MINUTES PASSED BEFORE THE TALK WAS RENEWED
HE'S GONE TO TOWN HE SAYS--YES THE MAIL TRAIN--TO GET SOME DIAMONDS FOR MISS BRANDON--A PRESENT--THAT OUGHT TO HAVE COME THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
THEY STEER NO MORE BUT DRIVE BEFORE THE WIND
BUT AS YOU SAY THERE IS TIME ENOUGH TO THINK OF ALL THAT QUITE SO--TIME ENOUGH
MR LARCOM ACCIDENTALLY HAD ANOTHER--A CYLINDRICAL BIT OF STEEL WITH A HINGE IN THE END OF IT AND A FEW QUEER WARDS
I--YOU KNOW--I'M INTERESTED FOR ALL PARTIES WELL SIR OF MR WYLDER I CAN'T SAY AS I KNOW NO MORE THAN HE'S BEEN A SUBJEK OF MUCH UNPLEASANT FEELIN WHICH I SHOULD SAY THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF ANGRY TALK SINCE I LAST SAW YOU SIR BETWEEN MISS LAKE AND THE CAPTING AH YES YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING OF THE KIND
C LARKIN'S GROOM WAS WAITING FOR AN ANSWER
IS THERE NO DOCTOR--I'M VERY MUCH HURT SAID LAKE FAINTLY AFTER A MINUTE'S SILENCE
OF COURSE THEY QUITE UNDERSTOOD HIS POSITION
HE WENT TO THE DOOR BUT IT WAS NOT TO CALL FOR WATER OR FOR OLD TAMAR
AND INDEED THEY WALKED TOGETHER STOPPING NOW AND AGAIN AS IT SEEMED VERY AMICABLY
WE'RE QUIET AND YOU'RE MORE LIKE TO WEIGH MY WORDS HERE--AND YOU'LL BE ALONE FOR A WHILE AFTER YOU LEAVE ME AND CAN PONDER MY ADVICE AS YOU WALK HOME BY THE PATH WELL WHATEVER IT IS I SUPPOSE IT WON'T TAKE VERY LONG TO SAY--LET US WALK ON TO THE STONE THERE AND THEN I'LL STOP AND HEAR IT--BUT YOU MUST NOT KEEP ME ALL NIGHT HE SAID VERY PEEVISHLY
I HAVE NOTHING PARTICULAR AT PRESENT ABOUT TENANTS OR TIMBER EXCEPT THE THREE ACRES OF OAK BEHIND FARMER TANBY'S--HAVE IT TOOK DOWN
I HAD PROMISED CHELFORD TO RUN UP TO REDMAN'S FARM AND LET HIM KNOW IF THE JURY ARRIVED AT A VERDICT DURING HIS ABSENCE
THE RED AUTUMNAL SUN NEARING THE EDGE OF THE DISTANT HILLS LOOKED THROUGH THE HORIZONTAL MISTY AIR SHORN OF ITS BEAMS AND LIGHTED THE THIN AND GENTLE FEATURES OF THE VICAR WITH A MELANCHOLY RADIANCE
WEALDON WON'T REFUSE I RECKON--BUT DON'T LET LAKE GUESS WHAT THE 150_L IS FOR
HAVE ALL READY TO SIGN AND SEAL WHEN I COME BACK--CERTAINLY WITHIN A WEEK
BUT SHE COULD NOT PRAY
AND WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS DOG-CART AT DOLLINGTON WRAPPED HIS RUG ABOUT HIS LEGS WHIP AND REINS IN HAND AND THE OSTLER BUCKLED THE APRON ACROSS THE SUN WAS SETTING REDLY BEHIND THE HILLS
ALL WOMEN ARE
AND THEN YOU REMEMBER WHENEVER AFTERWARDS THEY OPENED THE DOOR OF THE VAULT THE WIND ENTERING IN MADE SUCH MOANINGS IN HER HOLLOW MOUTH AND DECLARED THINGS SO HORRIBLE THAT THEY BUILT UP THE DOOR OF THE VAULT AND ENTERED IT NO MORE
OH NO!--NOTHING OF MARK AND HE ADDED WITH A DEEP SIGH OH DEAR
HE SAID HE COULD FORCE MARK WYLDER TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY
YOU'VE BEEN HURT IN THE FOOT EH
THEY'VE JUST RUN IN TO LUNCHEON
LARKIN GETTING HIS HAT ON STERNLY AND THINKING HOW LIKELY HE WAS TO THROW HIMSELF INTO THE MILL RACE AND IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS THAT MARK WHOM HE AND LARCOM HAD BOTH SEEN ALIVE AND WELL LAST NIGHT--THE LATTER INDEED THIS MORNING_--COULD POSSIBLY BE THE MAN
BUT SOMETIMES SHE WOULD TALK AND TREAT HER HEARERS TO HER RECOLLECTIONS AND RECOUNT ANECDOTES WITH A SORT OF GRIM CLEVERNESS NOT WHOLLY UNAMUSING
AND THEN COMES THE PALINGENESIS--THE RISING IN GLORY
ALL MR JOS
A MERE--A--THE SLIGHTEST THING IN THE WORLD NOT SCHOOLFELLOWS----YOU ARE NOT AN ETON MAN EH SAID LAKE
HE COULD MAKE WILLIAM WYLDER OF COURSE DO WHATEVER HE PLEASED
AND BESIDES I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME THINGS THEY WANT ME TO DO IN THE SETTLEMENTS AND YOU WERE ALWAYS A LONG-HEADED FELLOW
I THINK MY OFFER WILL STRIKE YOU AS A GREAT ONE CONSIDERING THE POSTURE OF AFFAIRS
I HOPE I SHALL SOON BE FAVOURED WITH HIS DIRECTIONS AS TO WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY HE'S AN ODD FELLOW
READ IT
ON A LOW SEAT CHATTING TO HER AS I CAME UP WAS A VERY HANDSOME AND RATHER SINGULAR-LOOKING GIRL FAIR WITH A LIGHT GOLDEN-TINTED HAIR
HIS EYE WAS ON THE WINDOW NOW AND THEN IT DROPPED WITH A VAGUE PRESAGE UPON THE SLEEK HEAD OF THE DARING AND ENIGMATICAL CAPTAIN READING THE LITANY FROM BATTLE MURDER AND SUDDEN DEATH GOOD LORD DELIVER US AND HE ALMOST FANCIED HE SAW A YELLOW SKULL OVER HIS SHOULDER GLOWERING CYNICALLY ON THE PRAYER-BOOK
THEN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS LETTERS OPENED A LARGE-SEALED ENVELOPE WITH S.C.G
AND THERE WAS A STERN PERSON WHO HELD A RENEWAL OF ONE OF HIS OLD PAPER SUBSIDIES TO THE NECESSITIES OF HIS SCAMPISH FRIEND CLARKSON WHO WAS PLAINLY A DIFFICULT AND AWFUL CHARACTER TO DEAL WITH
I NEVER MEAN TO CONJECTURE IF I CAN HELP IT AGAIN AND THE WAN ORACLE HAVING SPOKEN SHE SATE DOWN IN THE SAME SORT OF ABSTRACTION AGAIN BESIDE DORCAS AND SHE LOOKED FULL IN HER COUSIN'S EYES
WELL THINGS DO TURN OUT VERY ODDLY
I NEVER HAD
HEAVEN FORGIVE ME VERY GOOD HE WHISPERED AND HE PEEPED OVER THE BANISTER AND THEN ENTERED RACHEL'S SILENT ROOM DARKENED WITH CLOSED SHUTTERS THE WHITE CURTAINS AND WHITE COVERLET SO LIKE THE DARK CHAMBER OF WHITE DEATH HE HAD INTENDED SPEAKING TO TAMAR THERE BUT CHANGED HIS MIND OR RATHER COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND
SAME AS YESTERDAY--NO CHANGE--ONLY A LITTLE BLEEDING LAST NIGHT--NOT ARTERIAL
IT WAS A GREAT WINDFALL FOR A POOR DEVIL LIKE ME
AND THOUGH THE DAY IS LONGER THERE IS MORE TO DO IN IT YOU SEE I DON'T WONDER AT YOUR BEING A STAY-AT-HOME FOR TO MY EYES IT IS THE PRETTIEST SPOT OF EARTH IN ALL THE WORLD
IN A MOMENT MORE WE WERE ALL ON THE GROUND AND SCRAMBLING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE RAVINE AMONG ROCKS BOUGHS BRAMBLES AND FERNS IN THE DEEP SHADOWS OF THE GORGE THE DOGS STILL YELLING FURIOUSLY FROM BELOW
I MAY BE WILD AND--AND WHAT YOU PLEASE BUT I'M NO WORSE THAN THAT BRUTE MARK WYLDER AND YOU NEVER TURNED UP YOUR EYES WHEN HE WAS HER CHOICE
HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
KEWES THE EMINENT QUEEN'S COUNSEL ON A CASE FURNISHED BY JOS
AND INDEED SO SCANDALOUS AN APPENDAGE WAS BUGGS THAT IF HE HAD BEEN LESS USEFUL I BELIEVE THE PURE ATTORNEY WHO IN THE UNCOMFORTABLE WORDS OF JOHN BUNYAN HAD FOUND A CLEANER ROAD TO HELL WOULD HAVE CASHIERED HIM LONG AGO
AND NO MATTER WHAT YOU OR RACHEL MAY SAY IT WAS KINDER TO WITHHOLD IT AS LONG AS I COULD HE GLANCED AT THE DOOR AND SPOKE IN A LOWER TONE
SO I TOOK IT FOR A KEEPSAKE
DORCAS DID NOT DEIGN TO LOOK AFTER HIM
THE BAKER AND JOHN THOMAS OF THE DELFT IRONMONGERY SPONGE AND UMBRELLA SHOP AT THE CORNER OF CHURCH STREET IN GYLINGDEN WERE ANNOUNCED BY THE FATIGUED SERVANT
THE WINGED WORDS--MAKING PLEASANT MUSIC--FLEW PLEASANTLY AWAY NOW AMONG TRANSPARENT LEAVES AND GLIMMERING SUN
I DO NOT OFFER ANY CONJECTURES AS TO THE CAUSE OF THIS VERY EMBARRASSING PROCEDURE ON HIS PART
I AM VERY LONELY HERE AND MY SPIRITS ARE GONE AND I NEVER NEEDED KINDNESS SO MUCH BEFORE AND SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HER COUSIN'S NECK AND BRAVE RACHEL AT LAST BURST INTO TEARS
AT THIS MOMENT THE LARGE WHITE MARSEILLES WAISTCOAT OF GRAVE MR LARCOM APPEARED FOLLOWED BY A TALL POWDERED FOOTMAN AND THEIR CANDLES AND BUSINESS-LIKE PROCEEDINGS FRIGHTENED AWAY THE PHANTOMS
IT WAS A GREAT SHOCK
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING AS HE WALKED DOWN THE MILL-ROAD TOWARD THE TOWN HE MET LORD CHELFORD ON HIS WAY TO MAKE ENQUIRY ABOUT RACHEL AT REDMAN'S FARM
THIS TRANSIENT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL--A GLAMOUR BEGUILING OUR SENSES
RACHEL LEANED BACK AND SEEMED TO ENJOY IT VERY MUCH
AND MISS LAKE WAS SHUT IN AND DROVE ON ALONE UNDER THE THICK CANOPY OF OLD TREES AND UP THE MILL-ROAD LIGHTED BY THE FLASHING LAMPS TO HER OWN LITTLE PRECINCTS AND WAS IN TURN AT HOME--SOLITARY TRISTE BUT STILL HER HOME
BUT IF HE COSTS YOU MORE I HEREBY PROMISE TO PAY IT
LARKIN TOOK HIS LEAVE A LITTLE ABRUPTLY
BUT I HAVE RECEIVED ONLY THE OTHER DAY A LETTER FROM A NEW CORRESPONDENT--A PERSON SIGNING HIMSELF JAMES DUTTON--ANNOUNCING HIS BELIEF THAT MR MARK WYLDER IS DEAD--_IS DEAD_--AND HAS BEEN MADE AWAY WITH BY FOUL MEANS
AND AFTER A LITTLE SHE SAID I PROMISED RACHEL TO SHOW YOU MY JEWELS
THEN CAME THE THOUGHT--PERHAPS THEY UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER AND THAT WAS THE MEANING OF STANLEY'S UNEXPECTED VISIT
WE CAN STATE UPON AUTHORITY THAT THE CORONER WILL HOLD HIS INQUEST ON THE BODY TO-MORROW AT TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE TOWN OF GYLINGDEN
I LOOK ON IT AS WHOLLY UNIMPORTANT AND IT IS REALLY NOT A POINT WORTH STANDING UPON FOR A SECOND SO THAT ALSO WAS AGREED TO
THE NIGHT WAS ALTOGETHER SO CHARMING THAT LORD CHELFORD WAS TEMPTED
BUT LET ME REST
CHAPTER XXX
THE PLAIN TRUTH IS I DID NOT VERY MUCH LIKE HIM
ARE YOU SURE SAID CAPTAIN LAKE PEEPING TOWARD THAT APARTMENT OVER THE OLD WOMAN'S SHOULDER
SHE KNEW SOMETHING WAS COMING--THE SECRET SHE HAD INVOKED SO LONG--AND SHE WAS APPALLED
NEVER WAS A POOR DEVIL SO LECTURED ABOUT NOTHING AS I BETWEEN YOU
THE ATTORNEY ROSE MADE ANOTHER BOW AND THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND MOVED IN A WAY THAT WAS OPPRESSIVELY GENTLEMANLIKE TO THE DOOR AND SPEEDILY VANISHED AT THE LITTLE WICKET
AND I HAVE A HALFPENNY TO BUY APPLES FOR LITTLE FAIRY THE ATTORNEY STOOD AT HIS WINDOW WITH A SHADOW ON HIS FACE AND HIS SMALL EYES A LITTLE CONTRACTED AND SNAKELIKE FOLLOWING THE SLIM FIGURE OF THE THREADBARE VICAR AND HIS GOLDEN-HAIRED DANCING LITTLE COMRADE
LARKIN STALKED UNDER THE ANTIQUE RIBBED ARCHES OF THE LITTLE AISLE
A PERSON WANTED TO SEE CAPTAIN LAKE
THE LONG STREET OF GYLINGDEN STRETCHED DIM AND SILENT BEFORE HIM
HEAR HEAR HEAR SAID LAKE LANGUIDLY AND TAPPING A LITTLE APPLAUSE ON THE TABLE WHILE HE WATCHED THE SOLICITOR'S RHETORIC WITH HIS SLY DISCONCERTING SMILE
BUT SOMEHOW I'M NOT THE LEAST AFRAID
CHAPTER LIX
BE THE FACT HOW IT MAY THOSE LAKES BROTHER AND SISTER HAVE A GUILTY KNOWLEDGE OF THE AFFAIR
HE WROTE IN TERMS WHICH ROUSED JIM DUTTON'S WRATH
I SUPPOSE THE WORLD THINKS ME A VERY HAPPY FELLOW MISS LAKE HE SAID WITH A RATHER PENSIVE GLANCE OF ENQUIRY INTO THAT YOUNG LADY'S EYES AS HE SET DOWN HIS HOCK-GLASS
MY MISTRESS'--HE ALWAYS CALLED HER SO AND LAKE THE CAPTING--'HAS BEEN TAKIN ON HOFFLE LAST NIGHT WHATEVER COME BETWIXT EM
THERE WAS NO BELL FOR POOR MARK
I DIDN'T UPON MY HONOUR THEN YOU DID NOT MEAN TO INSULT ME SIR SAID LAKE
THEY PUT HIM ON DUTY FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS WITH HIS EAR TO THE RIVER LISTENING FOR VOICES
BUT NO MATTER
I HAD ONLY A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF LARGE DUSKY EYES AND VERY EXQUISITE FEATURES--MORE DELICATE THAN THE GRECIAN MODELS AND WITH A WONDERFUL TRANSPARENCY LIKE TINTED MARBLE
SHE WAS GLAD THE DIE WAS CAST AND THAT IT WAS OUT OF HER POWER TO RETRACT
LARKIN THEN SOUGHT TO RECOUP HIMSELF OUT OF THE ASSETS OF THE DECEASED CAPTAIN
I WONDER RADIE YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF HER AT NIGHT IN THIS CHEERFUL HABITATION
THE OTHER WITNESS WAS SIR JULIUS HOCKLEY OF HOCKLEY AN UNEXCEPTIONABLE EVIDENCE THOUGH A GOOD DEAL ON THE TURF
DOCTOR BUDDLE WAS DARK AND SHORT IN HIS ANSWERS TO VOLUBLE LITTLE MRS WYLDER--THOUGH OF COURSE QUITE RESPECTFUL--AND THE VICAR SAW HIM DOWN THE NARROW STAIRS AND THEY TURNED INTO THE STUDY FOR A MOMENT AND SAID BUDDLE IN AN UNDER TONE HE'S VERY ILL--I CAN SAY NOTHING ELSE AND THERE WAS A PAUSE
AND HER BROTHER STANLEY HAD ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH AND THEREFORE WAS MUCH BETTER OFF THAN MANY A YOUNGER SON OF A DUKE
THOUGH A SHREWD FELLOW IN MANY WAYS HE HAD A SECRET CONVICTION THAT NO WOMAN COULD RESIST HIM
CONCERNING A NEW DANGER WHICH THREATENED CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE
DO THEY KNOW ANYTHING VERY BAD--ARE YOU IN THEIR POWER WHY MY DEAREST WHAT ON EARTH COULD PUT SUCH A WILD FANCY IN YOUR HEAD SAID LAKE WITH A STRANGE LAUGH AND AS SHE FANCIED GROWING STILL PALER
THIS TIME HE WENT TO A SOMEWHAT MYSTERIOUS AND BARRICADOED PLACE WHERE IN A BLAZE OF LIGHT IN VARIOUS ROOMS GENTLEMEN IN HATS AND SOME IN GREAT COATS WERE PLAYING ROULETTE OR HAZARD
SEVERAL GROUPS PASSED CLOSE BY HIM IN THEIR PLEASANT CIRCUIT
AND WE'LL LOOK AT THE PICTURES IN THE OLD FRENCH JOSEPHUS AND MAMMA AND I WILL TELL STORIES
HE'S A DEEP FELLOW TOO
HE RESPECTED HIS AUDACITY AND HIS MYSTERY AND HE WONDERED INTENSELY WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THAT SMALL SKULL UNDER THE LIGHT AND GLOSSY HAIR AND ANXIOUSLY GUESSED HOW VITALLY IT MIGHT POSSIBLY AFFECT HIM AND WONDERED WHAT HIS SCHEMES WERE AFTER THE ELECTION--_QUIESCERE FACIAM SUPERBIAM POTENTIUM
LADY CHELFORD PERHAPS KNEW MORE OF THE CAPRICIOUS AND DARING CHARACTER OF THE LADIES OF THE BRANDON LINE THAN I AND MAY HAVE DISCOVERED SOME SIGNS OF A COMING STORM IN THE ORACULAR QUESTIONS WHICH HAD FALLEN SO HARMONIOUSLY FROM THOSE BEAUTIFUL LIPS
A FEW DAYS LATER JOS
IF NOT MAY I BEG MISS LAKE THAT YOU WILL DEFER IT FOR A MOMENT WILLIAM WYLDER LAY DOWN THAT PEN
AND WHAT DELIGHTFUL AIR RADIE
THERE WAS TIME ENOUGH HOWEVER TO SETTLE THE POINT
THE POSITION OF THE GOOD ATTORNEY THEREFORE IN A COMMERCIAL POINT OF VIEW WAS EMINENTLY HEALTHY AND CONVENIENT
BUT TALKING OF STANLEY REMINDS ME OF TROUBLE AND FOLLIES THAT I CAN'T HELP OR PREVENT
SHE SAT DOWN
I WON'T SELL AT ALL OH
BUT THOUGH SOMETHING OF A NUN IN HER WAY OF LIFE THERE WAS NO GERM OF THE OLD MAID IN HER AND MONEY WAS NOT OFTEN IN HER THOUGHTS
IT WAS WARPED AND ARCHED ALL ALONG BY THE WALL BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE WINDOW
MR JOHNSON THE PROPRIETOR YOU MAY BE SURE DOES NOT CONFOUND HIM WITH THE GREAT SQUIRES THE BARONETS AND FEUDAL NAMES OF THE COUNTY
WHEN STANLEY TOOK HIS LEAVE AFTER ONE OF THESE VISITS--STOLEN VISITS SOMEHOW THEY ALWAYS SEEMED TO HER--THE SOLITARY MISTRESS OF REDMAN'S FARM INVARIABLY EXPERIENCED THE NERVOUS REACTION WHICH FOLLOWS THE ARTIFICIAL CALM OF SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT
NOW SOME MEN--AND SIR HARRY WAS OF THEM--ARE CHURLISH AND FEROCIOUS OVER THEIR LOVES AS CERTAIN BRUTES ARE OVER THEIR VICTUALS
I AM SO VERY GLAD I MET YOU I WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL SO SOLITARY HE PLACED HIMSELF BESIDE MISS LAKE
HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN SOMETHING TO HEAR WHAT WAS PASSING
BE FRANK
YOU HAD BETTER RETURN TO GYLINGDEN AND LEAVE ME SO I WILL DEAR RADIE BY-AND-BY SAID HE WITH HIS AMUSED SMILE
SIR HARRY BRACTON WAS THE CRACK SHOT OF SWIVEL'S GALLERY
BUT WORK IS FOUND OR INVENTED--FOR SOMETIMES THE HOUR IS DULL AND THAT BRIGHT SPIRITED AND AT HEART IT MAY BE BITTER EXILE WILL MAKE OUT LIFE SOMEHOW
BY-AND-BY IN MOONLIGHT THEY WILL RETURN TO THE CASEMENT PIPING THE SAME TUNE IN GHOSTLY TONES
LORD CHELFORD BEING AN EARLY MAN WAS NOTWITHSTANDING THE BALL OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT DRESSING WHEN ST ANGE HIS SWISS SERVANT KNOCKED AT HIS DOOR WITH A DOZEN POCKETHANDKERCHIEFS A BOTTLE OF EAU-DE-COLOGNE AND SOME OTHER PROPERTIES OF HIS METIER
HIS EYES WERE SMALL AND REDDISH AS IF ACCUSTOMED TO CRY
THANK GOD FOR THAT SAID DORCAS HARDLY ABOVE HER BREATH
THE MEN FROM THE GAS-WORKS THE MASONS AND BLACKSMITHS WERE TO BE MARCHED IN BY LUKE SAMWAYS
THE TELEGRAPH WAS NOT THEN AS NOW WHISPERING SECRETS ALL OVER ENGLAND AT THE RATE OF TWO HUNDRED MILES A SECOND AND FIVE SHILLINGS PER TWENTY WORDS
FOR I NEVER COULD QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT STRANGE LADY
MAKE ANY EXCUSE YOU LIKE
AND PRAY TELL ME IF I HAVE SAID ANYTHING I OUGHT NOT OH NO--NOTHING I ASSURE YOU REPLIED MR LARKIN WITH A LOFTY AND GENTLE DRYNESS
EVERYONE OF THEM LADEN WITH DEEDS AND PAPERS
SHE WAS SO UNRESERVED IT SEEMED AND YET IN THIS DIRECTNESS THERE WAS SOMETHING ALMOST CONTEMPTUOUS
THE ONLY CLIENT AMONG HIS WEALTHY SUPPORTERS WHO EVER WENT IN A GRUDGING SPIRIT INTO ONE OF THESE LITTLE BILLS OF JOS
EARLY DEATH OF THE FRAIL AND FAIR TENEMENT OF CLAY--BUT A STILL EARLIER DEATH OF HAPPINESS
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE TO GUIDE HIM TO A CONCLUSION AND THE GOOD PEOPLE WHO FORMED THAT POLITE AND ANIMATED MOB WERE IN HIS EYES ONE AND ALL QUITE BELOW THE LEVEL OF TRAGEDY OR EVEN OF MELODRAMA
HAD NOT YOU BETTER TURN BACK TO GYLINGDEN OR THE LODGE OR WHEREVER YOU MEAN TO PASS THE EVENING AND LEAVE ME TO MY QUIET WALK AND MY SOLITUDE IN A FEW MINUTES DEAR RADIE--YOU ARE SO ODD
HE HAD NOT VERY MUCH FACT TO GO UPON
WELL THAT MAY BE SIR BUT I AMOST SUSPECK SHE'S BEEN HURTED SOMEHOW
THEY HAVE--BUT THAT'S OVER AND SHE TURNED UP HER PALLID PUCKERED FACE AND WITH A TREMBLING AND KNOTTED PAIR OF HANDS UPLIFTED SHE MUTTERED AN AWFUL THANKSGIVING
ON HIS WAY A RUSTIC SEAT UNDER THE SHADOW INVITED HIM AND HE SAT DOWN DRAWING RACHEL'S LETTER FROM HIS POCKET
AND SIR JULIUS HOCKLEY WITNESSED--I THINK THEY CALL IT--THAT LETTER OF ATTORNEY WHICH MARK SENT ABOUT A WEEK SINCE TO MR LARKIN
HE HAD AN AMBITION TOO TO PASS FOR A HIGH-BRED GENTLEMAN AND THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE DONE BY A SOMEWHAT LOFTY AND DRAWLING WAY OF TALKING AND DISTRIBUTING HIS LENGTH OF LIMB IN WHAT HE FANCIED WERE EASY ATTITUDES
AND YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME IN THE MEANTIME AND THE DOCTOR SHOOK HANDS VERY HARD WITH THE VICAR AT THE HALL-DOOR AND MADE HIS WAY HOMEWARD--THE VICAR'S EYES FOLLOWING HIM TILL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT
LARKIN ESQ OF THE LODGE WORTH ALREADY L27,000 AND ON THE HIGH ROAD TO GREATNESS AND THE TRUMPERY LITTLE PLACE IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF
I REMEMBER HIM WELL WHEN I WAS A BOY
IT WILL PROBABLY KILL HIM
HE MAY RETALIATE YOUR THREAT BY A COUNTER MOVE MORE DREADFUL
HOW IS YOUR SISTER CAPTAIN LAKE HAVE YOU SEEN HER TO-DAY ASKED OLD LADY CHELFORD RATHER BENIGNANTLY
THERE WAS NO TRACE OF MADNESS IN HIS LETTERS NOR OF RESTRAINT
WAS NEVER WILD ENOUGH TO THINK OF ASKING AFTER AND DOES NOT KNOW
OLD WOMEN ALWAYS LIKE RASCALS AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY
SOONER OR LATER HE WOULD GET MASTER JIM INTO A FIX AND HOLD HIM ALSO SPELL-BOUND IN THE SAME SORT OF NIGHTMARE
I SUPPOSE SHE KNEW I WAS LOOKING AT HER
YOU ARE TIRED TO DEATH AND PALE AND SORRY MY DEAR CHILD
YES RADIE YOU SEE I'VE FOUND YOU OUT AND HIS EYE WANDERED STILL SMILING ODDLY OVER THE FRONT OF HER QUAINT HABITATION
WELL LARKIN HOW D'YE DO
YOU FOUND YOURSELF THIS MORNING EXACTLY AT THE POINT FROM WHICH YOU COMMENCED YESTERDAY AND TO-MORROW WOULD RECOMMENCE WHERE YOU STARTED THE DAY BEFORE
AND IT NEEDED A GREAT EFFORT TO ENABLE HER TO TAKE THE TURN UP THE DARK AND LONELY MILL-ROAD LEADING TO REDMAN'S FARM
HAPPY SHE HAD DISCOVERED IT SO SOON
THAT'S YOUR PLAN CAPTAIN THEN THE CAPTAIN RECURRED TO HIS LETTERS WHICH WERE A LARGER PACK THAN USUAL THIS MORNING CHATTING ALL THE TIME WITH WEALDON AND ME ON THE TREMENDOUS TOPIC AND TOSSING ASIDE EVERY LETTER THAT DID NOT BEAR ON THE COMING STRUGGLE
THE CRIME WOULD HARDLY BE GREATER
THERE WAS BUT ONE RISK IN IT WHICH WAS IN THE COARSE PERFIDY OF MARK WELDER HIMSELF WHO WOULD DESIRE NO BETTER FUN IN SOME OF HIS MOODS THAN BOASTING TO LAKE OF THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT IN JOS
BUT I'M SO GLAD YOU ARE HOME AGAIN
NOR HOW THAT COULD BENEFIT ANYONE
LARKIN HIS CLERK AND THE DESPATCH-BOX HAD A SHORT WAIT IN THE DUTCH ROOM BEFORE HIS ADMISSION TO THE LIBRARY WHERE AN ANIMATED DEBATE WAS AUDIBLE
RODIN WAS WONT TO CONSULT
BECAUSE HE IS QUITE SURE TO ADVISE AGAINST IT ANSWERED STANLEY SHARPLY
BUT HE WAS IN A SORT OF WAY ATTACHED TO THE LAKE FAMILY THE SON OF AN HEREDITARY TENANT ON THAT ESTATE WHICH HAD MADE ITSELF WINGS AND FLOWN AWAY LIKE THE ISLAND OF LAPUTA
HE SAW FROM HIS WINDOW THE GOOD VICAR WALK SMILING BY IN WHITE CHOKER AND SEEDY BLACK HIS LITTLE BOY HOLDING BY HIS FINGERS AND CAPERING AND WHEELING IN FRONT AND SMILING UP IN HIS FACE
HE COMES DE SE BATTRE FROM BEATING HIMSELF IN DUEL--IL A ETE ATTEINT DANS LA POITRINE--LE PAUVRE GENTIL-HOMME
I HAVE SOMETIMES IN MY TRAVELS LIGHTED ON A STRANGELY SHAPED MOUNTAIN WHOSE HUGE CURVES AND SOMBRE COLOURING HAVE INTERESTED ME INDEFINABLY
TO MISS LAKE LORD CHELFORD THOUGH NOT IN SET TERMS YET IN MANY PLEASANT WAYS APOLOGISED FOR HIS MOTHER'S IMPERTINENCE
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE HIS ENTIRE EXPENSES REACHED EXACTLY L5 3_S AND WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE WAS THE GOOD MAN'S PROFIT UPON THAT SMALL ITEM
BUT ONE OF MR JUKE'S YOUNG MEN IS KEEPING THEM OFF LAKE MADE AN EFFORT TO RAISE HIMSELF BUT WITH A GRIN AND A SUPPRESSED MOAN HE ABANDONED IT
THE ONLY COMPENSATION I EXACT FOR YOUR INVOLUNTARY PART IN THE MATTER IS THAT YOU DISTINCTLY CONVEY THE TENOR OF MY LANGUAGE TO MR WYLDER ON THE FIRST OCCASION ON WHICH HE AFFORDS YOU AN OPPORTUNITY OF COMMUNICATING WITH HIM
BUT TOGETHER THE ESTATES ARE MORE THAN MOST TITLED MEN POSSESS
HANG ME IF I KNOW THE SOUNDINGS OR WHERE I'M GOING
CHELFORD IS JUST RETURNED FROM BRIGHTON
THE ROOM WAS NOT SO DARK THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE DISTINCTLY ENOUGH
BUT MEN SUFFER THAT WAY TOO--THOUGH OF COURSE VERY LIKELY IT'S MORE THEIR OWN FAULT IT IS VERY SAD SAID MISS LAKE WHO WAS BUSY WITH A PATE
DISTURBING AND MINGLING WITH HER DREAMS
MISS LAKE WAS NOT THERE
THE STEP WAS EVIDENTLY TAKEN ON THE CALCULATION THAT HE WOULD STRIKE AND OFFER A HANDSOME COMPROMISE
NO DIFFICULTY CAN EXIST BUT IN THE ONE QUARTER
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE TRUTH WHEN NEXT I GO DOWN TO REDMAN'S FARM
BUT I HAVE QUITE MADE UP MY MIND AND NOTHING CAN EVER CHANGE ME
WILL YOU THEREFORE FAVOUR ME IF CONVENIENT BY THE BEARER WITH THE SMALL NOTE OF CONSENT WHICH MUST ACCOMPANY THE ARTICLES AGREEING TO SELL
WHICH SHE THINKS ALSO THE POOR YOUNG GENTLEMAN IS CERTAINLY A-DYING IS THERE ANY VACANT BED-ROOM NEAR WHERE YOU HAVE PLACED HIM
OH DARLING THE WORLD'S GHASTLY FOR ME NOW I WISH DORCAS WE WERE AWAY--AS YOU USED TO SAY--IN SOME WILD AND SOLITARY RETREAT LIVING TOGETHER--TWO RECLUSES--BUT ALL THAT IS VISIONARY--QUITE VISIONARY NOW DORCAS SIGHED
I WENT OVER WYLDER'S HISTORY IN MY MIND AND CAPTAIN LAKE'S--ALL I COULD RECOLLECT OF IT--BUT COULD FIND NO CLUE AND THAT HORRIBLE VISITATION OR VISION
YOU MUSTN'T BE ANGRY
AND I REMAIN ALONE UNDER THAT DREADFUL BURDEN PLEASE MISS BRANDON THE DOCTOR'S DOWN STAIRS WITH CAPTAIN LAKE SAID THE MAID OPENING THE DOOR
SHAKE HANDS SIR
WHAT DO YOU SAY
AND I MUST BE PERMITTED TO ADD THAT I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE QUITE RID OF IT AND ONLY REGRET THE MANNER IN WHICH MY WISH HAS BEEN ANTICIPATED A DISCOURTESY WHICH I ATTRIBUTE HOWEVER TO FEMALE INFLUENCE THE CONCLUDING SENTENCE WAS SPOKEN WITH A VILE SNEER AND A MEASURED EMPHASIS DIRECTED AT LORD CHELFORD WHO COLOURED WITH A SUDDEN ACCESS OF INDIGNATION AND STOOD STERN AND MENACING AS THE ATTORNEY WITH A GENERAL BOW TO THE COMPANY AND A LOFTY NONCHALANCE MADE HIS EXIT FROM THE APARTMENT
EVERY PERFECT WOMAN IS I THINK A SISTER OF FLORA'S
HE STOPPED IN A HORROR AND AS HE GAZED THE FIGURE SUDDENLY DREW BACK AND DISAPPEARED
HE HAS GOT THE VICARAGE OF NAUNTON FRIARS OH THEN WILL IS NOT QUITE SUCH A FOOL AS WE TOOK HIM FOR IT IS WORTH JUST L180 A YEAR
WE HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO SEE ANOTHER GIRL--BRIGHT AND FAIR-HAIRED RACHEL LAKE--IN THE SMALL ROOMS OF REDMAN'S FARM
THERE WAS RUNNING ALL THIS TIME IN RACHEL'S MIND AND HAD BEEN ALMOST SINCE THE FIRST MENACING MENTION OF WYLDER'S NAME BY HER BROTHER AN INDISTINCT REMEMBRANCE OF SOMETHING UNPLEASANT OR HORRIBLE
AND BETWEEN YOU I SHALL BE CALLED IN QUESTION YOU WRETCHED FOOL STANLEY WAS TAKING THESE HARD TERMS VERY MEEKLY FOR A SAVAGE YOUNG COXCOMB LIKE HIM
I AM SURE YOU HAVE QUITE MISUNDERSTOOD HIM
DORCAS IS THE BELLE OF THE COUNTY
SHALL WE PUT IT OFF FOR A LITTLE
HOW DEVILISH STIFF BRACTON'S MAN WAS ABOUT IT
ALL THAT YOU HAVE DARED TO INSINUATE IS UTTERLY FALSE
AND SHE CAN BE AMUSING AND TALKS VERY WELL BUT SHE HAS NO SENSE--SHE IS UTTERLY QUIXOTIC--SHE IS NO MORE CAPABLE OF ADVISING THAN A CHILD I SHOULD NOT HAVE FANCIED THAT ALTHOUGH YOU SAY SO STANLEY SHE ANSWERED CARELESSLY ADDING A GERANIUM TO HER BOUQUET
THE ATTORNEY HAD JUST SAID THERE PLEASE IN REPLY TO THE VICAR'S QUESTION WHERE DO I WRITE MY NAME AND RED BUGGS GRINNING WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN LIKE AN OVER-HEATED DOG AND THE SAD AND BILIOUS YOUNG GENTLEMAN STOOD BY TO WITNESS THE EXECUTION OF THE CLERIC'S AUTOGRAPH
DORCAS WAS VERY PALE AND HER GAZE WAS STERN AND SOMETHING UNDEFINABLY WILD IN HER QUIETUDE
EIGHT YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE WE MET LAST AND THAT IS SOMETHING AT ANY TIME
BE PERFECTLY CIVIL WITH STANLEY LAKE TILL I COME ON BOARD--THAT IS INDISPENSABLE
WHAT A STRANGE PASSION IS AMBITION I THOUGHT
IT CONTAINS BUT FOUR LINES AND I'VE GIVEN YOU THE FORM
THIS SORT OF INFLEXIBLE MERRY-MAKING IN NATURE SEEMS MARVELLOUSLY SELFISH IN THE EYES OF ANXIOUS CAPTAIN LAKE
THE BLEACHED FACE SO MEEK SO CRUEL OF THAT SHABBY SPECTRE IN THE SMALL LOW PARLOUR OF REDMAN'S FARM WAS ALWAYS BEFORE HER
POOR DOLLY WAS TIRED
UNDER PRETEXT OF BUSINESS AT NAUNTON JOS
BECAUSE WITH MORE RELUCTANCE THAN I CAN TELL I AT LENGTH CONSENT AT LARKIN'S ENTREATY I MAY SAY TO BANK AND FUND HIS MONEY BUT DORCAS'S MIND RETAINED ITS FIRST IMPRESSION
BEFORE TEA SIR JUST AS MISS LAKE HARRIVED IN THE BROUGHAM AND SO ON
CHAPTER XXXVIII
POOH POOH
IT WAS NOT VERY AMUSING THIS INTERCHANGE OF THOUGHT AND FEELING BETWEEN LARKIN AND THE DOWAGER UPON A THEME ALREADY SO WELL VENTILATED AS MARK WYLDER'S ABSCONDING AND THEREFORE I LET IT PASS
HE'S IN THE CHURCH QUITE RIGHT--THE ONLY THING HE WAS FIT FOR AND CAPTAIN LAKE LAUGHED LIKE A MAN WHO ENJOYS A JOKE SLILY
HE DID NOT HESITATE TO FOLLOW--BUT WITH THE SOFT TREAD OF A POLITE BUTLER DOING HIS OFFICES OVER THE THICK CARPET OF A DRAWING-ROOM--AND IT WAS IN HIS MIND--'SUPPOSE HE DOES DISCOVER ME WHAT THEN
SO THAT THIRTY-TWO POUNDS OUT OF HIS BORROWED FIFTY WERE FORFEIT FOR THESE ITEMS WITHIN A YEAR AND A MONTH
LET US SIT DOWN HERE--WE SHAN'T BE INTERRUPTED--AND JUST ANSWER YOUR WRETCHED FRIEND RACHEL TWO OR THREE QUESTIONS AND HEAR WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY RACHEL WAS FLUSHED AND EXCITED AND SAT WITH THE LITTLE BOY STILL IN HER ARMS
PERHAPS SOME DOUBT ABOUT THE CAPTAIN'S STATE OF HEALTH AND MISGIVING AS TO DELIRIUM TREMENS MAY HAVE FLICKERED OVER HIS BRAIN
I'LL PAY EVERYTHING BUT DEAR MISS LAKE I CAN'T SAID THE VICAR DEJECTEDLY
NEXT MORNING AT HALF-PAST SEVEN O'CLOCK A DOZEN OR SO OF RUSTICS UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR JACKSON ARRIVED AT THE BACK ENTRANCE OF BRANDON HALL BEARING STANLEY LAKE UPON A SHUTTER WITH GLASSY EYES THAT DID NOT SEEM TO SEE SUNKEN FACE AND A VERY BLUE TINGE ABOUT HIS MOUTH
YOU SAID YOU KNOW IN THE PARK YOU WOULD TELL CHELFORD
THE ATTORNEY'S ADVENTURES ON THE WAY HOME
TO MY MIND THERE IS SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY SATISFACTORY IN THE INTENSE SOLIDITY OF THOSE OLD STAIRS AND FLOORS--NO SPRING IN THE PLANKS NOT A CREAK
AND NOW RACHEL I TELL YOU WHAT WAS UNKNOWN TO ALL BUT MYSELF AND HEAVEN--LOOKING NEITHER FOR COUNSEL NOR FOR PITY NOR FOR SYMPATHY BUT BECAUSE I MUST AND YOU HAVE SWORN TO KEEP MY SECRET
LARKIN ROSE WITH A NEGLIGENT AND LORDLY CASE AND PLACED A CHAIR FOR MISS LAKE SO THAT THE LIGHT MIGHT FALL FULL UPON HER FEATURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS USUAL DIPLOMATIC ARRANGEMENT WHICH HE FANCIED COMPLACENTLY NO ONE HAD EVER DETECTED
BUT CAPTAIN LAKE DID LOOK UP AND THERE WAS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARILY UNPLEASANT IN HIS YELLOW EYES AS HE FIXED THEM UPON THE CONTRACTED PUPILS OF THE ATTORNEY WHO NOTHING DAUNTED WENT ON PRAY EXCUSE ME--THANK YOU CAPTAIN LAKE--THEY SAY ONE IS BETTER HEARD WHEN LOOKED AT THAN WHEN NOT SEEN
SO UNLESS YOU COMPLETE THAT INSTRUMENT NOW I REGRET TO SAY I MUST TAKE IT BACK UNFINISHED AND THE RESULT MAY BE TO DEFEAT THE ARRANGEMENT ALTOGETHER AND IF THE CONSEQUENCES SHOULD PROVE SERIOUS I AT LEAST AM NOT TO BLAME DON'T SIGN I ENTREAT I IMPLORE OF YOU
AND SO IT IS YOU JIM SAID THE CAPTAIN
AND IN HIS WAY OF ESTIMATING HIS FELLOW MEN AND THE CANONS OF HONOUR THERE WAS OCCASIONALLY PERCEPTIBLE A FAINT FLAVOUR OF THE VILLAINOUS AND AN UNDEFINED SAVOUR AT TIMES OF BRIMSTONE
CHAPTER XIV
AND TO BE SO IN HIS LINE OF BUSINESS HE MUST HAVE HIS WITS ABOUT HIM I CAN TELL YOU HE AMUSED ME DEVILISHLY SAID WYLDER WITH A SORT OF EXHORTATION HE TREATED ME TO
NOT A BIT IN LOVE
IT WAS ONLY THE DEMIGODS WHO VENTURED WITHIN THE CIRCLE
THIS GOOD OLD COUPLE HAVING LOVED EARLY AND WAITED LONG AND LIVED TOGETHER WITH WONDERFUL TENDERNESS AND GAIETY OF HEART THEIR ALLOTTED SPAN BID FAREWELL FOR A LITTLE WHILE--THE GENTLE LITTLE LADY GOING FIRST AND IN ABOUT TWO YEARS MORE THE GOOD RECTOR FOLLOWING
SHE DID NOT KNOW OR EVEN SUSPECT THAT SHE HAD BEEN LIVING IN AN AERIAL CASTLE AND WORSHIPPING AN UNREAL IMAGE UNTIL ON A SUDDEN ALL WAS REVEALED IN THAT CHANCE GLEAM OF CRUEL LIGHTNING THE LINE IN THAT LETTER WHICH SHE READ SO OFTEN SPELLED OVER AND PUZZLED OVER SO INDUSTRIOUSLY THOUGH IT WAS CLEAR ENOUGH
ONLY THAT I KNOW YOU ARE REALLY FOND OF US I SHOULD NEVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN
GOOD-NIGHT DEAR GOOD-NIGHT AND THE YOUNG LADIES PARTED WITH A KISS AND THEN ANOTHER
YES I CERTAINLY WILL--YOU MUST HAVE ADVICE
THROUGH THIS HOWEVER FOR THE FIRST TIME JOS
IT PERHAPS INDICATED AN ANXIETY AND A MENTAL LOOK-OUT IN THAT DIRECTION FOR HE REALLY EXPECTED NO SUCH THING
AND I SUPPOSE I'M A BIT PUT OUT BY THAT DISREPUTABLE DOG'S BEING HERE--I MEAN LAKE
WYLDER THAT WHICH CONTEMPLATES A RESIDENCE IN HIS HOUSE AND IN THE RESPECTABLE BOSOM I MAY SAY OF THAT IN MANY RESPECTS UNBLEMISHED FAMILY MISS LAKE STARED WITH A LOOK OF FIERCE ENQUIRY AT THE ATTORNEY
AND I COULD NOT ADVISE THE PARTY YOU NAMED SIR TO SELL HIS REMAINDER FOR A SONG YOU'LL ADVISE AS YOU PLEASE SIR AND NO DOUBT NOT WITHOUT SUFFICIENT REASON RETORTED CAPTAIN LAKE
OR IT MAY BE HIS AGITATION AND FEAR CRIED AMEN TO THE REPROACH
AND STANLEY ALSO ROSE PRECIPITATELY AND CAUGHT HER IN HIS ARMS FOR SHE WAS FALLING
THOUGH OF COURSE YOU MAY ARGUE A POINT IF NEED BE AND LET YOUR HUSBAND HEAR REASON AND HAVING RULED THE POINT OLD LADY CHELFORD LEANED BACK AND RESUMED HER DOZE
DON'T BE TOO HARD ON ME DEAR CHELFORD
ABUNDANCE OF MALICE
SUCH AS STRIKE US SOMETIMES WITH A DESOLATE SCEPTICISM AND MAKE US FANCY THAT ALL AFFECTION IS ILLUSION AND PERISHABLE WITH THE DECEITS AND VANITIES OF EARTH
BUT WHAT WAS HE TO DO EXACTLY
THAT WILL BE A SPOKE IN SIR HARRY'S WHEEL SIR HARRY WHO SAID LAKE
YOU OUGHT NOT MY DEAR SIR--PRAY PERMIT ME TO SAY--YOU REALLY OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ALLOWED IT TO COME TO THIS THE POOR VICAR SIGHED PROFOUNDLY AND SHOOK HIS HEAD A CONTRITE MAN
I AM CERTAIN HE TRUSTS NO ONE ON EARTH AND AT THE SAME TIME EXCEPT IN HIS CONFIDENCES HE'S THE RASHEST MAN LIVING
HE TOOK THE PREVIOUS LETTER FROWNED ON IT FIERCELY FROM HIS RAT-LIKE EYES AND THEN WITH AN EJACULATION AS LIKE AN OATH AS SO GOOD A MAN COULD UTTER HE EXCLAIMED I HAVE IT THEN CAME A PAUSE AND HE SAID BOTH ALIKE!--BLANKS LEFT WHEN THE LETTERS WERE WRITTEN AND THE DATES FILLED IN AFTERWARD--_NOT THE SAME HAND I THINK_--NO NOT THE SAME--_POSITIVELY A DIFFERENT HAND THEN JOS
BUT I'M POSITIVE THAT IS ALL SO THIS LITTLE MATTER SETTLED THE LAWYER TOOK HIS LEAVE
NO SAID RACHEL A LITTLE PETTISHLY AND PUT IT ASIDE
HE ALSO THOUGHT A LARGER CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE STATED AND ACKNOWLEDGED AS PAID SAY 22,000_L THE VICAR WOULD REALLY RECEIVE JUST 2,200_L COSTS WOULD DO SOMETHING TO REDUCE THE BALANCE FOR JOS
WILLIAM WYLDER WAS SITTING AT HIS DESK AND A LARGE SHEET OF LAW SCRIVENERY ON THICK PAPER WITH A STAMP IN THE CORNER WAS BEFORE HIM
YOU HAVE BROUGHT IT TO THAT--YOU MUST COME I'M NOT FIT FOR IT I TELL YOU--I'M NOT
MY DEAR SIR
MARK CLAPPED ON HIS HAT AND RIFLED THE POCKET OF HIS PALETOT OF HIS CIGAR-CASE AND MATCHES AND SPLUTTERED A CURSE OR TWO ACCORDING TO OLD NOLLEKINS RECEIPT FOR EASING THE MIND AND ON THE DOOR-STEPS LIGHTED HIS CHEROOT AND BECAME GRADUALLY MORE PHILOSOPHICAL
I RATHER THINK NOT
I PEEPED THROUGH THE DENSE WINDOW CURTAIN THERE WERE NO SHUTTERS
AND THE MORE I REFLECT THE MORE AM I CONVINCED--IF YOU WILL NOT TELL HER STANLEY THAT I MUST
IT MAY HAVE BEEN MERE FANCY OR IT MAY HAVE REFERRED TO SOMETHING LONG AGO IMPERFECTLY HEARD
BUT AS WE KNOW PERCEIVING THAT THE SITUATION OF AFFAIRS LIKE ALL UNCERTAIN CONJUNCTURES OFFERED MANIFESTLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SPECULATION HE WAS PERHAPS DESIROUS LIKE OUR OLD FRIEND SINDBAD OF THAT GLEAM OF LIGHT WHICH MIGHT SHOW HIM THE GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES WITH WHICH THE FLOOR OF THE CATACOMB WAS STREWN
AND A SPIRITED MINX TOO
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING INDEFINITELY PLEASANT IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ALTHOUGH A BETROTHED BRIDE THE YOUNG LADY STILL WAS FANCY FREE
DO YOU REMEMBER MISS BEAUCHAMP RADIE HE ASKED RATHER SUDDENLY AFTER A VERY LONG PAUSE
WHO'S THERE HE WHISPERED
SO IN EARNEST TERMS AGAIN SHE CONJURED HER AT LEAST TO LAY THE WHOLE MATTER BEFORE SOME FRIEND ON WHOM SHE COULD RELY
FORTUNATELY THE MARRIAGE CONSIDERING THE ANTIQUITY AND THE TERRITORIAL POSITION OF THE TWO FAMILIES WHO WERE INVOLVED WAS TO HAVE BEEN A VERY QUIET AFFAIR INDEED--NO FESTIVITIES--NO FIRE-WORKS--NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A COUNTY GALA--NO GLARE OR THUNDER--NO CONCUSSION OF SOCIETY--A DIGNIFIED BUT SECLUDED MARRIAGE
TO KISS DORCAS AND GOOD DOLLY
THE OLD FELLOW OUGHT TO BE UNDER RESTRAINT
DOES IT NOT STRIKE YOU--HAD WE NOT BETTER CONSIDER CONSIDER WHAT SIR SAID THE ATTORNEY WITH A SNAP AND LOSING HIS TEMPER SOMEWHAT
IT WAS DOUBTFUL IF HE WAS TO SEE ANOTHER MORNING
THERE'S THE HIGHWAY--MARK WOULD HAVE MADE A CAPITAL GARROTTER THE ATTORNEY GROANED AND TURNED UP HIS EYES
I WISH SHE WAS DIFFERENT
NOW RADIE YOU MUST BE REASONABLE--WHO HAVE I TO ADVISE WITH NOT ME STANLEY--KEEP YOUR PLOTS AND YOUR SECRETS TO YOURSELF
I HAD BEEN UTTERLY MYSTIFIED AND SO I PRESUME HAD ALL THE OTHER LOOKERS-ON
HIS WHITE TOPCOAT AND HAT WERE TO CLOTHE THE EFFIGY WHICH WAS TO SWING OVER THE BONFIRE
MAYBE IT WAS A VISION SIR SUGGESTED THE TOWN CLERK
YES YOU'D LIKE TO GO AND MAMMA WILL STAY AT HOME AND TRY TO BE USEFUL IN HER POOR MISERABLE WAY AND SO ON
I SHALL SOON BE AS WELL AS I AM EVER LIKELY TO BE--THAT IS QUITE WELL ANSWERED RACHEL
PUT ON YOUR BONNET AND MY OLD SHAWL CHILD
DORCAS IS COMING SHE SAID
OUR DINNER PARTY AT BRANDON
AND DOLLY AND THE VICAR FELT THAT RACHEL'S NOBLE PROPOSAL WAS THE MAKING OF THEM
WHAT ARE YOU NOW AND SO WITH KNITTED BROWS AND STERN LIPS A CADAVERIC GAZE WAS RETURNED ON HER FROM THE MIRROR
BUT I HAVE MADE THE PROMISE AND I'LL KEEP IT
I CAN HAVE NO OBJECT IN MISLEADING YOU AND YOU HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED FROM ME ANYTHING BUT KINDNESS AND AFFECTION
I EXAMINED IT CAREFULLY AND LAID IT DOWN UNOPENED
IF HE WAS SHUT UP SOMEWHERE THEY COULD MAKE HIM WRITE A SET OF THESE LETTERS OFF AT A SITTING AND SEND THEM FROM PLACE TO PLACE TO BE POSTED TO MAKE US THINK HE WAS TRAVELLING AND PREVENT OUR FINDING WHERE THEY KEEP HIM
AND THE BALD HEAD OF THE TALL ATTORNEY AND THE GLOSS ON HIS EASY BLACK FROCK-COAT AND HIS GOLD WATCH-CHAIN AND THE LONG AND LARGE GLOVED HAND DEPENDING NEAR THE CARPET WITH THE GLOVE OF THE OTHER IN IT
INDEED MY DEAR SIR VERY CAUTIOUS
HE BOWED AND SMILED IN THE MOST UNEXCEPTIONABLE OF WHITE CHOKERS AND THE DAPPEREST OF DRESS COATS AND DREW OFF THE WHITEST IMAGINABLE PAIR OF KID GLOVES WHEN HE SAT DOWN TO THE PIANO SUBSIDING IN A SORT OF BOW UPON THE MUSIC-STOOL AND STRIKING THOSE FEW BRISK AND NOISY CHORDS WITH WHICH SUCH ARTISTS PROCLAIM SILENCE AND REASSURE THEMSELVES
ON THE CONTRARY THINGS WERE GROWING DECIDEDLY MORE AWFUL
I ENCLOSE A NOTE WHICH PERHAPS YOU WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO GIVE HIM SHOULD YOU MEET BEFORE YOU LEAVE TOWN THE NOTE TO MARK WYLDER WAS IN THESE TERMS DEAR WYLDER,--I HAD HOPED TO SEE YOU BEFORE NOW AT BRANDON
I CALCULATE I'LL BE HERE AGAIN CERTAINLY IN THREE DAYS TIME
HE HAD MADE A STILL BETTER PURCHASE FROM THE VICAR
AS YOU ARE SO SERIOUSLY PRESSED AND YOUR BROTHER'S RETURN DELAYED IT MERELY CROSSED MY MIND AS A THING WORTH TRYING IT WAS VERY KIND AND THOUGHTFUL
FROM RACHEL TO DORCAS FROM DORCAS TO THE ATTORNEY AND FROM HIM TO DUTTON AND BACK AGAIN HE RAMBLED IN THE INFERNAL LITANY HE MUTTERED OVER THE INAUSPICIOUS TARN AMONG THE ENCLOSING BANKS AND UNDULATIONS AND SOLITARY AND LONELY WOODS
RACHEL CRIED QUIETLY AS SHE LISTENED AND AT LAST WORN OUT BY MANY FEVERISH NIGHTS AND THE FATIGUES OF HER JOURNEY SHE FELL INTO A DISTURBED SLUMBER WITH MANY STARTINGS AND SUDDEN WAKINGS WITH CRIES AND STRANGE EXCITEMENT
SO BY THIS TIME BEING SPLENDID IN FRENCH BOOTS AND WHITE VEST AND ALTOGETHER PERFECT AND REFRESHED I EMERGED FROM MY DRESSING-ROOM WYLDER BY MY SIDE
I THINK HE PRAYS RATHER MORE THAN IS GOOD FOR HIS CLIENTS
WHO WOULD SPEAK THE WHOLE TRUTH OR LIKE TO HEAR IT?--NOT I I KNOW NOR I SHE SAID QUIETLY
I PAUSED LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW MISS BRANDON TO SPEAK BUT SHE DID NOT CHOOSE TO DO SO THINKING I SUPPOSE IT WAS MY BUSINESS
THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE FEARED FROM PRYING EYES AND LISTENING EARS
I DON'T THE LEAST PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND HIM
THE FRANKNESS OF THE SENTIMENTAL JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU AND OF MY COARSE FRIEND MARK WYLDER IS BUT A DAMNABLE FORM OF VICIOUS EGOTISM
I COULD NOT TELL WHICH WAY HE HAD TURNED ON GETTING INTO THE THICKET
I'M GOING INTO THE TOWN
BUT LAWYER LARKIN KNEW THE VALUE OF THE PRECIOUS METALS AND WAITED FOR MORE DATA
BUT WE WERE IN NO MOOD FOR THE PICTURESQUE
HE OPENED THE TINY GARDEN-GATE OF REDMAN'S FARM LOOKING ABOUT HIM WITH A SUPERCILIOUS BENEVOLENCE LIKE A MAN CONSCIOUS OF BESTOWING A DISTINCTION
COME IN AND HAVE A CHOP WILL YOU NO THANK YOU I'VE HAD MY BREAKFAST YOU HAVE HAVE YOU
NO MY LOVE--I CAN'T INDEED
MARK WYLDER WAS NOT THE PERSON FOR ANY SUCH OFFICE
IT'S WELL TO BE DISTINGUISHED IN ANY LINE
YOU HAVE ACCOUNTED IN NO WAY FOR YOUR ABSENCE
NOTHING HAS OCCURRED AS YET AT LEAST AFFECTING THE INTERESTS OF THAT FAMILY
BUT HE WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCES I HAD
BEWARE BEWARE
THERE WAS A PLEASANT EVENING LIGHT STILL AND THE GAS-LAMPS MADE A PURPLISH GLOW AGAINST IT
IF IT WERE NOT THE BEST THING FOR THE CAPTAIN SURELY IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE
WHAT GOOD CAN IT POSSIBLY DO YOU
IT WAS NEVER MORE THAN A CONTINGENCY
NOT THAT I RECOLLECT--IN FACT THERE WAS NOT TIME
AND IF THE SURMISES WHICH ARE AFLOAT PROVE WELL-FOUNDED THE DISCOVERY WILL SET AT REST THE SPECULATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN BUSY RESPECTING THE WHEREABOUTS OF A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN OF LARGE PROPERTY AND ANCIENT LINEAGE WHO SOME TIME SINCE MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED AND WILL NO DOUBT THROW THIS COUNTY INTO A STATE OF VERY UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT
THERE WAS A LONG WAIT HERE LEST HE SHOULD RETURN
HE SPOKE IN A SORT OF UNDERTONE LIKE A MAN WHO DOES NOT WANT TO BE OVERHEARD AND THE ROOM WAS QUITE LARGE ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT SORT OF SECRECY EASY WITHOUT THE APPEARANCE OF SEEKING IT
I WAS I THOUGHT TO BUILD UP OUR HOUSE
IF HE DOESN'T I WILL
BUT BEATING THE AIR
PRAY TELL ME FRANKLY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ALL THIS I AM NOT QUITE SURE MISS BRANDON THAT I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION I REPLIED ENQUIRINGLY
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR YOU PERHAPS FOR MYSELF I HAD DIED LONG AGO WELL THAT IS ANOTHER THING
IF IT WERE OFFERED ME THIS MOMENT POSITIVELY I WOULD NOT HAVE IT
WHO--WHAT--WHAT IS IT SAID HE
AND THUS HE WAS ENABLED TO IDENTIFY HIM
A PARAGRAPH IN THE COUNTY PAPER
I AM A MOST UNHAPPY CREATURE FORCED BY CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE YOUR ENEMY FOR A TIME--NOT ALWAYS
HE EXPLAINED TO THE VICAR THE FOLLY OF BORROWING INSIGNIFICANT AND INSUFFICIENT SUMS--THE TROUBLE AND CONSEQUENTLY THE COST OF WHICH WERE JUST AS GREAT AS OF AN ADEQUATE ONE
BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE BLAND TONES OF LARCOM THE SOLEMN BUTLER ANNOUNCED THE REV
THE WYLDERS ARE ALL WELL I HOPE QUITE WELL SO FAR AS I AM AWARE ANSWERED THE ATTORNEY WITH A GRIM POLITENESS
DEAR LARKIN,--YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO FIND ME IN THIS PORT BUT I THINK MY SECRET CRUISE IS NEARLY OVER NOW AND YOU WILL SAY THE PLAN WAS A MASTER-STROKE AND WELL EXECUTED BY A POOR DEVIL WITH NOBODY TO ADVISE HIM
I DON'T KNOW THE YOUNG LADY AND I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE BUT I TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN SERVE ME RETORTED STANLEY WITH A SAVAGE GLARE AND FEATURES WHITENED WITH PASSION AND YOU SHALL SERVE ME
AND MR LARKIN THOUGH HIS MIND WAS PRETTY UNIVERSALLY OF THE INQUISITIVE ORDER BEGAN IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE TO FEEL A SPECIAL CURIOSITY
THE TERROR OF DISCOVERY AND RUIN INSTANTLY SUPERVENED
SO THE ATTORNEY'S BUSINESS WAS TO SMILE AND WATCH--TO WATCH AND OF COURSE TO PRAY AS HERETOFORE--BUT SPECIALLY TO WATCH
HER BROTHER WAS TO SEE HER HOME AND THERE WAS A LEAVE-TAKING AND THE YOUNG LADIES WHISPERED A WORD OR TWO AND KISSED AFTER THE MANNER OF THEIR KIND
I RATHER THINK WITH PROPER PRECAUTIONS IT WOULD
AND YET MISS LAKE WE ARE ALL MORE OR LESS COWARDS OR DECEIVERS--AT LEAST TO THE EXTENT OF SUPPRESSION
HER YOUNG LADY HAD WALKED UP TO BRANDON TAKING THE LITTLE GIRL WITH HER AND SHE SUPPOSED WOULD BE BACK AGAIN EARLY
AND PERHAPS I HAVE DISTRESSED YOU NO DORCAS I AM PRETTY WELL
SHE HAD JUST TIME TO SEE THAT IT WAS A BROUGHAM AND TO RECOGNISE THE BRANDON LIVERIES WHEN IT DREW UP AT THE GARDEN WICKET AND DORCAS CALLED TO HER FROM THE OPEN WINDOW
THAT HE STRUCK IN A STATE OF UTTER CONFUSION AND WHEN HE SAW MARK DEAD WITH HIS FEET ON THE PATH AND HIS HEAD LYING OVER THE EDGE HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LIMB ALMOST TO BRING HIM BACK
AND THE KETTLE BEING IN A SKITTISH SINGING STATE QUICKLY WENT OFF IN A BOIL AND TAMAR ACTUALLY MADE TEA IN HER BROWN TEA-POT
BUT THIS SUDDEN EXPANSION WAS NOT TO LAST
HIS THREAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
PERHAPS HE REPEATED WITH A SNEER
AND MR JOS
AND MR JOS
AND MR JOS
AND MR JOS
AND SO IT CARRIED HIM PLEASANTLY A GOOD WAY ON HIS WALK AND HE WAS NOW IN THE SHADOW OF THE DENSE COPSEWOOD THAT MANTLES THE DEEP RAVINE WHICH DEBOUCHES INTO REDMAN'S DELL
I WOULD THIS MOMENT--I'D BE DELIGHTED--ONLY JUST UNTIL I HAVE GOT A LETTER WHICH I EXPECT--A LETTER I ASSURE YOU NOTHING MORE--AND UNTIL I HAVE GOT IT IT WOULD BE SIMPLY TO WASTE YOUR TIME AND PATIENCE TO WEARY YOU WITH ANY SUCH--ANY SUCH SECRET SAID DORCAS
HOW WHITE YOUR TABLE IS HOW NICE YOUR CHAIRS
AND IT WAS EXASPERATING THAT THE NATIVE CRAFT AND DARING OF THIS INEXPERIENCED CAPTAIN SHOULD FORESTALL SO ACCOMPLISHED A MAN OF BUSINESS AS JOS
SHE KNEW THE RISK OF EXASPERATING THAT TALL MAN OF GOD WHO LIVED AT THE LODGE
EVERYTHING WAS GOING PERFECTLY SMOOTHLY WITH HIM
HE PASSED THE PILE OF CLOAKS BUT A FEW STEPS AND AGAIN TURNED TOWARD BRANDON
AND THEN SHE SAID WITHOUT HOWEVER REMOVING HER EYES FROM THE MINIATURE YOU ARE I BELIEVE MR DE CRESSERON A VERY OLD FRIEND OF MR WYLDER'S
WHAT OBJECT ON EARTH CAN I HAVE IN IMPAIRING THE ESTATE
SHE SMILED AND TO OUTWARD SEEMING WAS THE SAME
HOCKLEY IS A VERY PRETTY PLACE IS NOT IT A SWEET PLACE
IT IS LIKE THE TURF WHERE EVERYONE ADMITS AN HONEST MAN CAN HARDLY HOLD HIS OWN
BUT NOT HIS FIRST OBJECT
WITH HIS EYES CLOSE TO THE WINDOW PANE HE SAW HIS MASTER GLIDE SWIFTLY ALONG THE SHORT TERRACE WHICH COVERS THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND DISAPPEAR DOWN THE STEPS LIKE A SPECTRE SINKING INTO THE EARTH
IT WAS LATE IN THE AUTUMN AND I WAS SKIMMING ALONG THROUGH A RICH ENGLISH COUNTY IN A POSTCHAISE AMONG TALL HEDGEROWS GILDED LIKE ALL THE LANDSCAPE WITH THE SLANTING BEAMS OF SUNSET
HOW DELICIOUS THESE VIOLETS ARE SAID STANLEY LEANING FOR A MOMENT OVER THE FRAGRANT PURPLE DOME THAT CROWNED A CHINA STAND ON THE MARBLE TABLE THEY WERE PASSING
ON COMING OUT THERE WAS A BLACK CLOUD UPON THE ATTORNEY'S FEATURES AND HE SAID SULKILY TO EDWARDS WHO HAD TURNED THE KEY IN THE LOCK AND NOW TOUCHED HIS HAT AS HE LISTENED YES THERE IS A RESEMBLANCE BUT IT IS ALL A MISTAKE
I HAPPENED AT THAT MOMENT TO RAISE MY EYES AND I SAW DORCAS'S FACE REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR
AND AS THE MAHOMETAN PRAYS TOWARDS MECCA AND THE JEW TOWARDS JERUSALEM SO CAPTAIN LAKE'S MORNING ORISONS WHATSOEVER THEY WERE WERE OFFERED AT THE WINDOW OF HIS BED-ROOM TOWARD LONDON FROM WHENCE HE LOOKED FOR HIS SALVATION OR IT MIGHT BE THE OTHER THING--WITH A DREADFUL YEARNING
BUT YOU MUST NOT SACRIFICE YOURSELF YOUR FORTUNE AND YOUR HAPPINESS TO A SHADOW
NO NOTHING BUT A DISPLAY OF HIS TEMPER AND MORALS--NOT VERY ASTONISHING AFTER ALL--AND LIKE AN UGLY PICTURE OR A DREADFUL DREAM IN NO WAY TO AFFECT HER AFTER-LIFE EXCEPT AS AN ODIOUS REMEMBRANCE
SO FORTH JUMPED THE CAPTAIN SO FAR RELIEVED AND GLIDED INTO THE DIM QUADRANGLE WITH ITS SQUARE OF SMOKY SKY OVERHEAD
IT IS NOT A CLASS OF BUSINESS THAT I LIKE OR WOULD TOUCH WITH ONE OF MY FINGERS SO TO SPEAK AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD GENTLY
A GOOD DEAL OF BLOOD HAD FLOWED FROM HIM UPON THE ARM AND SIDE OF ONE OF THE MEN WHO SUPPORTED HIS HEAD
I MUST GIVE YOU A LINE SO HE DID AND HID AWAY THE NOTE IN HIS DESPATCH-BOX AND SAID THE FAMILY ALL QUITE WELL I HOPE WHEREAT LARCOM SHOOK HIS HEAD
HE HATED MY FATHER BUT THAT WAS NO REASON TO PERSECUTE ME AND I BUT AN INFANT ALMOST WHEN HE DIED D HIM
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE MY BOW JUST YET AND I'VE NO WISH TO INJURE YOU
YOU'VE NOT COME DOWN HERE ON MY ACCOUNT--THAT IS ALTOGETHER
THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF A SATIRICAL MEANING HOWEVER IN HER FACE
WHOM HAVE I DEFRAUDED
GREAT NEWS SIR
THE NURSE DOZING A LITTLE IN HER CHAIR NEAR THE BED'S HEAD
THE RIGHT GLOVED WITH THE GLOVE OF THE OTHER HAND CLUTCHED FIRMLY IN IT
AND THE YOUNG LADY ON A SUDDEN LOOKED THOUGHTFUL--PERHAPS A LITTLE SAD
I THOUGHT HE SEEMED PUT OUT AND A LITTLE FLUSHED
HE WAS SO PARTICULARLY RESPECTFUL TO HER--HE SHOWED HER BY THE VERY FORM INTO WHICH HE SHAPED HIS GOOD WISHES THAT HE KNEW HOW FRANKLY SHE HAD OPPOSED THE MARRIAGE--HOW TRUE SHE HAD BEEN TO HER FRIEND DORCAS--AND SHE UNDERSTOOD HIM AND WAS GRATEFUL
WHAT ON EARTH CAN HE MEAN
AND SEE GIVE HIM THIS IT'S TEN POUNDS
SLUMBER BROODED OVER THE LITTLE TOWN AND HIS STEPS SOUNDED SHARP AND HOLLOW AMONG THE HOUSES
IN ALL OLD HOUSES ONE IS OF COURSE LIABLE TO ADVENTURES
AND YOUR OWN IMPRESSION THAT CAPTAIN LAKE WHICH I TRUST MAY TURN OUT TO BE SO KNOWS WHERE MR MARK WYLDER IS AT PRESENT STAYING I MUCH MISDOUBT SIR IT WON'T TURN OUT TO BE NO GOOD STORY FOR NO ONE SAID MR LARCOM IN A LOW AND SAD TONE AND WITH A LONG SHAKE OF HIS HEAD
HE HAD SEEN STRANGE THINGS THAT NIGHT
SHE IS NOT BETTER
AND SO THEY WERE EACH PLEASED IN THE WAY THAT SUITED THEM
WHAT'S WANTED IS A TRUSTWORTHY MAN PERFECTLY STEADY YOU SEE AND A FELLOW WHO KNOWS HOW TO HOLD HIS TONGUE THE LAST CONDITION PERHAPS STRUCK THE MAN AS A LITTLE ODD
ONLY A BACHELOR I'M AFRAID AS MY POOR MARGERY CALLS THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO TAKES HER OUT FOR A WALK ON A SUNDAY AND I FEAR MEANS NOTHING MORE THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I'VE FOUND CHELFORD TALKING TO YOU RACHEL AT THE DOOR OF YOUR PRETTY LITTLE GARDEN RACHEL LAUGHED
NO THANK YOU
AND DO YOU SEE YOU ARE NOT TO TALK YOU UNDERSTAND
AND CHATTING MERRILY SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE HER COUSIN WHO HELD THE REINS
AND I'LL LOSE MY LIFE BUT I'LL PREVENT IT NOW MAYBE WILLIE UPON MY WORD PERHAPS SHE'S QUITE RIGHT
AND THIS MRS WILLIAM WYLDER JUST ANNOUNCED BY SOFT-TONED LARCOM IS THE DAUGHTER THERE IS NO MISTAKING THE JOLLY SMILE AND LUMPY ODD LITTLE FEATURES AND RADIANCE OF AMIABILITY OF THE GOOD DOCTOR AND MRS CHUBLEY SO CURIOUSLY BLENDED IN HER LOVING FACE
I WONDER SHE DID NOT SMILE OFTENER IT BECAME HER SO
LARKIN WHO WAS TALKING AT THE CHURCH DOOR WITH THE GOOD VICAR
AND LIKE A MAN WITH TOO MANY BILLS AFLOAT FORGOT HIS ENDORSEMENTS OCCASIONALLY AND DID NOT RECOGNISE HIS OWN ACCEPTANCES WHEN PRESENTED AFTER AN INTERVAL
TO HER I WAS FIRST PRESENTED AND CURSORILY SCRUTINISED WITH A STATELY OLD-FASHIONED INSOLENCE AS IF I WERE A CANDIDATE FOOTMAN AND SO DISMISSED
THE BODY WAS GOT UP IN A SHEET TO A SORT OF SPRING CART WHICH AWAITED IT AND SO CONVEYED TO THE SILVER LION IN GYLINGDEN WHERE IT WAS PLACED IN A DISUSED COACH-HOUSE TO AWAIT THE INQUEST
HE'S QUITE HAPPY PLEASE HEAVEN HE'LL BE QUITE WELL TO-MORROW--THE DARLING LITTLE MAN SAID RACHEL ALL THE MORE FONDLY FOR THAT VAGUE OMEN THAT SEEMED TO SAY HE'S GONE HERE'S MR LARKIN CRIED DOLLY JUMPING UP AND SMILING AND NODDING AT THE WINDOW TO THAT LONG AND NATTY APPARITION WHO GLIDED TO THE HALL-DOOR WITH A SAD SMILE RAISING HIS WELL-BRUSHED HAT AS HE PASSED AND WITH ONE GRIM GLANCE BEYOND MRS WYLDER FOR HIS SHARP EYE HALF DETECTED ANOTHER PRESENCE IN THE ROOM
THERE WAS A PAINFUL CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THEM
NOW MISS LAKE WE ARE SITTING HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIM WHO IS THE SEARCHER OF HEARTS AND BEFORE WHOM NOTHING IS SECRET--YOUR EYE IS UPON MINE AND MINE ON YOURS--AND I ASK YOU DO YOU REMEMBER THE NIGHT OF THE 29TH OF SEPTEMBER LAST THAT MEAN PALE TAUNTING FACE
I'VE HAD TO SELL OUT
THE ATTORNEY BEGAN TO HATE STANLEY LAKE AS NONE BUT A MAN OF THAT STAMP CAN HATE THE PERSON WHO MARS A SCHEME OF AGGRANDISEMENT
NO--I'VE HEARD OF HIM ONLY WELL THEY SAY HE IS WASTING HIS PROPERTY VERY FAST
ALL THOSE SMALL SOUNDS LOST IN THE HUM OF MIDDAY LIFE NOW CAME INTO RELIEF--A TICKING IN THE WAINSCOT A CRACK NOW AND THEN IN THE JOINING OF THE FURNITURE AND OCCASIONALLY THE TAP OF A MOTH AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE FROM OUTSIDE SOUNDS SHARP AND ODD WHICH MADE HER WISH THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT WERE NOT SO INTENSE
I THINK IT A VERY WISE MEASURE I REPLIED MUCH SURPRISED
AND THE ATTORNEY GAVE HIM HIS ADVICE
THEREFORE YOU MUST HAVE HIM AT YOUR HOUSE--BE SURE--AND I WILL SQUARE IT WITH YOU
YES SAID MR LARKIN MILDLY IT IS SO VERY SHADOWY--AND THAT FEELING TOO IN THE WAY
BUT I ONLY LAUGH AT TRIFLES THAT WOULD HAVE RILED ME ONCE
THE DEEDS I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE LETTER YOU DIRECTED ME TO WRITE HAVE BEEN PREPARED--THAT IS IN DRAFT OF COURSE--AND THEN MY DEAR SIR I NEED NOT REMIND YOU THAT THERE REMAIN THE COSTS TO ME--THOSE OF COURSE AWAIT YOUR ENTIRE CONVENIENCE--BUT STILL IT WOULD NOT BE EITHER FOR YOUR OR MY ADVANTAGE THAT THEY SHOULD BE FORGOTTEN IN THE GENERAL ADJUSTMENT OF YOUR AFFAIRS WHICH I UNDERSTAND YOU TO PROPOSE THE VICAR'S COUNTENANCE FELL
AND IF SO WHAT WERE THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF SUCH FRIEND
I NEVER SUPPOSED FOR AN INSTANT MORE THAN I SAY
WILLIAM WYLDER RIGHTLY CONCEIVED YOU WHEN HE SO STATED YOUR MEANING TO ME YES CERTAINLY I AM MOST ANXIOUS TO ASSIST THEM WITH THAT LITTLE SUM WHICH I HAVE NOW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PROCURING A--EXACTLY--YES--WELL MISS LAKE THAT IS OF COURSE VERY KIND OF YOU--VERY KIND INDEED AND CREDITABLE TO YOUR FEELINGS
THOUGH ALL THE WORLD DOES NOT THINK WITH US I CAN TELL YOU THINGS COME BEFORE US IN OUR PROFESSION
AND THE AIR WAS FROSTY AND THE NIGHT DARK AS HE DREW UP BEFORE HIS OWN DOOR-STEPS NEAR GYLINGDEN
MARK WYLDER WAS THE LAST MAN IN THE WORLD TO SUBMIT TO PHYSICAL COERCION
HE WAS FOLLOWED NOT ACCOMPANIED--FOR MR LARKIN KNEW WHAT A GENTLEMAN HE WAS--BY A YOUNG AND BILIOUS CLERK WITH BLACK HAIR AND A MELANCHOLY COUNTENANCE AND BY OLD BUGGS--HIS CONDUCTING MAN--ALWAYS GRINNING WHOSE RED FACE GLARED IN THE LITTLE GARDEN LIKE A GREAT BUNCH OF HOLLYHOCKS
ITS APATHY INTERESTED ME INSCRUTABLY
THE BEST FRIEND THAT WAPSIE EVER MET WITH IN HIS LIFE BUT YOU WOULD NOT GIVE ME TO HIM WAPSIE GIVE YOU DARLING
AND I AM DETERMINED WE SHALL
HE WAS COMING BACK SO SHE RAN DOWN WITH THIS LIGHT OF HOPE IN HER FACE AND SAW OLD TAMAR IN THE HALL AND GAVE HER A GLASS OF THE WINE WHICH RACHEL HAD PROVIDED AND THE OLD WOMAN'S SPIRIT CAME AGAIN
MR LARKIN SMILED AND SHRUGGED REGRETFULLY AND REPLACED THE CASE IN HIS COAT POCKET
SOMETIMES HE WON SOMETIMES HE FAILED
YOU MEAN WYLDER OF COURSE YES
AND THE PRESENT WOULD BE INSIPID I THINK WITHOUT THEM
I ONLY CONJECTURE FOR HE REALLY DID SEEM TO HAVE A GREAT DEAL MORE ON HIS MIND
EVERYTHING LOOKED STRANGELY COLD AND MOTIONLESS OUTSIDE
FIE LAKE THERE'S NO POETRY IN YOU SAID LORD CHELFORD LAUGHING
WHEN I SAW TOM WEALDON ALONE NEXT DAY IN THE STREET OF GYLINGDEN HE WALKED A LITTLE WAY WITH ME AND SAID TOM WITH A GRAVE WINK DON'T LET THE CAPTAIN UP THERE BE HARD ON THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN
SO HE MADE UP HIS MIND AND MARCHED RESOLUTELY ONWARD AND HAD NEARLY REACHED THAT POINT AT WHICH THE CONVERGING SCREEN OF THICKET AGAIN OVERSHADOWS THE PATHWAY WHEN CLOSE AT HIS SIDE HE SAW THE TALL WHITE FIGURE PUSH ITSELF FORWARD AMONG THE BRANCHES AND IN A STARTLING UNDER-TONE OF ENQUIRY LIKE A CONSPIRATOR CHALLENGING HIS BROTHER A VOICE--THE SAME WHICH HE HAD SO OFTEN HEARD DURING THIS WALK--CRIED OVER HIS SHOULDER MARK WYLDER LARKIN SPRUNG BACK A PACE OR TWO TURNING HIS FACE FULL UPON THE CHALLENGER WHO IN HIS TURN WAS PERHAPS AFFRIGHTED FOR THE SAME VOICE UTTERED A SORT OF STRANGLED SHRIEK AND HE HEARD THE BRANCHES CRACK AND RUSTLE AS HE PUSHED HIS SUDDEN RETREAT THROUGH THEM--LEAVING THE ATTORNEY MORE HORRIFIED THAN EVER
WE ARE ALWAYS UNPLEASANT IN IT THIS AUSPICIOUS REMARK HE MADE TAKING OFF HIS HAT AND PLACING IT AND HIS CANE ON HER WORK-TABLE
BUT I HAVE BEEN ILL AND I AM A LITTLE TIRED
I MAY SAY I HAVE THAT HONOUR BUT WE HAVE NEVER BEEN THROWN TOGETHER
I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT INTO IT BUT I CAN'T GET AWAY NOW
THE FACT WAS THAT MR LARKIN HAD A LITTLE MISTAKEN HIS MAN
DON'T YOU THINK SO
DON'T YOU THINK SO
SHAKE HANDS WITH YOUR COUSIN MY DEAR SAID OLD LADY CHELFORD PEREMPTORILY
A MOST IMPORTANT WINDFALL
THE REFUSAL OF THEIR OWN CLIENT TO MAKE THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT HAS ALARMED THOSE GENTLEMEN I REGRET TO ADD FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR COSTS WHICH AS I BEFORE APPRISED YOU ARE THOUGH I CANNOT SAY EXCESSIVE CERTAINLY VERY HEAVY
I SAY SIR I DON'T RECOLLECT SAID LAKE GLARING FOR AN INSTANT IN HIS FACE VERY SAVAGELY
AND SIR HARRY CHERISHED AN AGREEABLE OPINION OF HIMSELF
MISS LAKE AGAIN LOOKED DOWN UPON THE PAGE AND AS SHE DID SO LORD CHELFORD TURNED AND SAID YOU ARE A WORSHIPPER OF TOM MOORE MISS LAKE AN ADMIRER PERHAPS--CERTAINLY NO WORSHIPPER
I ASSURE YOU IT IS A HAPPINESS TO ME TO BE OF ANY LITTLE USE
BEING TACITURN AND UNDEMONSTRATIVE SHE STOOD AT THE DOOR LOOKING WITH AS PLEASED A COUNTENANCE AS SO SAD A PORTRAIT COULD WEAR UPON THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN
AND TAMAR THOUGH NOT WITHOUT AWE FOR DARKNESS AND SOLITUDE EVEN WERE THERE NO ASSOCIATIONS OF A FEARFUL KIND IN THE LOCALITY ARE SUGGESTIVE AND DISMAL TO THE LAST
WERE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE
LARKIN WITH STILL AN AWFUL FOREBODING WEIGHING AT HIS HEART KNOCKED AT THE VICAR'S DOOR AND WAS SHOWN INTO THE STUDY
I WONDER WHAT IT IS MANY FAMILIES HAVE DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER MISS BRANDON
COULD ANYTHING BE IMAGINED SO MAD--SO UNACCOUNTABLE
THE KITCHEN WAS ONLY A KITCHEN NOW
YOU WON'T TELL YOUR SECRET
MY GOOD TAMAR WILL READ HER CHAPTERS ALOUD
LAKE GROUND HIS TEETH AND RETURNED JOS
THE NOISE RATTLED AND ROARED IN HIS EARS THE TALK SOUNDED MADLY AND THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE EXCITED AND MENACED HIM UNDEFINABLY AND HE FELT AS IF HE WAS ON THE POINT OF STARTING TO HIS FEET AND STAMPING AND SHOUTING
AND PICKIN WHAT MEANING I COULD OUT OF WHAT MISS LAKE SAID AND THE CAPTING COULD NOT DENY I DO SUSPECK SIR MOST SERIOUS AS HOW THEY HAVE PUT MR MARK WYLDER INTO A MAD-HOUSE
AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS I HAD RATHER MORE OF YOUR CONFIDENCE THAN I HAD ANY RIGHT TO AND DID NOT AT FIRST SEE THE NECESSITY OF CALLING IN LORD CHELFORD WHOSE EXPERIENCE OF BUSINESS IS NECESSARILY VERY LIMITED TO DIRECT YOU
I DO NOT CARE TO QUARREL
CHELFORD LIKE THE LAWYER HAD HEARD FROM MARK WYLDER THAT MORNING--A FEW LINES POSTPONING HIS RETURN
FROM THE THICKET AS HE PROCEEDED HE HEARD A VOICE--HE HAD OFTEN SHOT WOODCOCKS IN THAT COVER--CALLING IN A TONE THAT SOUNDED IN HIS EARS LIKE BANTER MARK--MARK--MARK--MARK HE STOPPED HOLDING HIS BREATH AND THE SOUND CEASED
AND I REALLY MUST TELL YOU FRANKLY THAT IF YOU DREAM OF ESCAPING THE MOST SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES YOU MUST AT ONCE PLACE YOURSELF AND YOUR AFFAIRS IN THE HANDS OF A COMPETENT MAN OF BUSINESS
NO DEAR
HE MAY HAVE MENTIONED IT
COME RADIE LET BY-GONES BE BY-GONES
AND I DO NOT LIKE YOURS JUST BECAUSE IN SPITE OF ALL I DO LOVE YOU STILL
THIS LATTER IMAGE HAD JUST GLIDED IN AND TAKEN ITS PLACE IN MY WAKING DREAM WHEN I THOUGHT I SAW REFLECTED IN THE POOL AT MY FEET THE SHAPE AND FACE WHICH I NEVER COULD FORGET OF THE WHITE LONG-CHINNED OLD MAN
DELICIOUS EVENING--YES SAID THE ATTORNEY THROWING BACK HIS LONG HEAD AND LETTING HIS MOUTH DROP
BESIDES THESE MATTERS OF WYLDER AND OF LAKE HE HAD ALSO A CLAUSE TO INSERT IN A PRIVATE ACT ON BEHALF OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE BAPTIST CHAPEL AT NAUNTON FRIARS
SO HE CAN'T YOU SEE BE WRITTEN TO
WHEN THEY HEAR IT--THEY DON'T RECOGNISE IT AND THEY WONDER WHAT THE SPEAKER IS DRIVING AT
SHE HEARD HIM WITH SUDDEN PANIC AND A SENSE OF COLD STOLE OVER HER
I FANCIED HE MIGHT BE--YOU KNOW THE DULHAMPTONS ARE AT BRIGHTON
I SO WISH I HAD BROUGHT HIS NOTE WITH ME
I WAS MISTAKEN
BUT THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE IS WORKING IN IT AND IT WILL SURELY GROW AND BRING FORTH FRUIT--THIRTY SIXTY AN HUNDREDFOLD--BE NOT DISMAYED
OLD TAMAR WAS SITTING IN THE PORCH WITH HER CLOSED BIBLE UPON HER KNEES
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING--HE'S A VERY STRANGE CLIENT SAID LARKIN LAUGHING AGAIN
WE WILL MAKE A LITTLE TOUR TOGETHER WHEN ALL THIS SHALL HAVE BLOWN OVER IN A FEW WEEKS AND CHOOSE OUR RETREAT
I MUST BE IN REALITY WHAT I AM HELD OUT TO THE WORLD AS BEING--YOUR TRUSTED AND RESPONSIBLE AND SOLE ADVISER
IF YOU CHOOSE TO BREAK IT YOU MAY GIVE ME SOME TROUBLE BUT YOU SHA'N'T COMPROMISE ME
EACH LADY LOOKED DOWN THE ONE IN SUFFERING THE OTHER IN THOUGHT
HE WAS MORE AFFECTIONATE THIS EVENING THAN USUAL
LITTLE MAN LOOKED WONDERINGLY FROM HIS TIRED EYES ON WAPSIE AND HIS THIN FINGERS CREPT ON HIS HAND AND WAPSIE TURNED ABOUT DRYING HIS EYES AND SAID LITTLE MAN
HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT
AND THERE ARE THOSE OF WHOM IT IS SAID THE POISON OF ASPS IS UNDER THEIR LIPS WHAT'S THAT EJACULATED RACHEL WITH A SUDDEN SHRIEK--THAT WHISPERED SHRIEK SO EXPRESSIVE AND GHASTLY THAT YOU PERHAPS HAVE ONCE HEARD IN YOUR LIFE--AND HER VERY LIPS GREW WHITE
FOR A SECOND I WAS UNABLE I THINK TO LIFT MY EYES FROM THE WATER WHICH PRESENTED THIS CADAVEROUS IMAGE
MY CASE--I SUPPOSE IT IS FATAL--I AM TO GO OUT OF THIS ROOM IN A LONG CLOTH-COVERED BOX
POOR LADY MARY BRANDON DYING THERE--SO UNHAPPILY MATED--A YOUNG MOTHER AND HER BABY SLEEPING IN LONG BRODERIE ANGLAISE ATTIRE UPON THE PILLOW ON THE SOFA AND WHOM SHE USED TO SHOW ME WITH A PEEPING MYSTERY AND HER FINGER TO HER SMILING LIP AND A GAIETY AND FONDNESS IN HER PRETTY FACE
I THINK I MUST GO TO THE LODGE AND SEE MR LARKIN FOR A MOMENT BUT YOU HAVE EATEN NOTHING REMONSTRATED HIS PARTNER
THEY LIVED I SUPPOSE OUT OF DOORS LIKE THE COWS AND ONLY CAME INTO THEIR SHEDS AT NIGHT WHEN THEY COULD NOT SEE THE ABSURD UGLINESS OF THE PLACES THEY INHABITED
HIS READING YOU SEE LAY MORE IN CIRCULATING LIBRARY LORE AND HE WAS NOT DEEP IN JOHNSON--AS FEW OF US WOULD BE I'M AFRAID IF IT WERE NOT FOR BOSWELL
IT'S SOME SORT OF GLASS
THIS PLAN FOR INSTANCE UNTIL YOU SPOKE THIS MOMENT WAS BUT A QUESTION AND ONE WHICH I COULD NOT SUBMIT UNTIL I HAD SEEN WEALDON AND HEARD HOW MATTERS STOOD AND WHAT CHANCES OF SUCCESS I SHOULD REALLY HAVE
I ADMIRE YOU RACHEL--I LIKE YOUR CHARACTER--I HAVE GROWN TO LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART AND MIND--QUITE DESPERATELY I THINK
I MENTION THAT MARK HAVING BROKEN HIS PROMISE AND PLAYED FOR HEAVY STAKES TOO BOTH ON BOARD HIS SHIP AND AT PLYMOUTH AND NAPLES WHICH I HAPPEN TO KNOW
BUT I TELL YOU AGAIN STANLEY UNLESS YOU PROMISE UPON YOUR HONOUR TO FORBEAR ALL MENTION OF MY NAME I WILL WRITE THIS EVENING TO LADY CHELFORD APPRISING HER OF YOUR PLANS AND OF MY OWN DISGUST AND INDIGNATION
FOR THE REST HE COULD SAY NOTHING
SO OUT HE WENT INTO THE CHILL FRESH NIGHT-AIR AND ROUND THE CORNER INTO THE QUAINT MAIN-STREET OF GYLINGDEN AND WALKED DOWN IT IN THE DARK NEARLY TO THE LAST HOUSE BY THE CORNER OF THE REDMAN'S DELL ROAD AND THEN BACK AGAIN AND SO ON TRYING TO TIRE HIMSELF I THINK
HOW DO YOU DO MARGERY
WHAT THE GREAT LUTHER CALLED WITHOUT DESCRIBING THEM HIS TRIBULATIONS'--THOSE DREADFUL DOUBTS AND APATHIES WHICH AT TIMES MENACE AND DARKEN THE RADIANT FABRIC OF FAITH AND FILL THE SOUL WITH NAMELESS HORRORS
I HAVE TAKEN A FANCY TO WALK ON THE COMMON THAT IS ALL--A KIND OF LONGING
A DOZEN LINES OF ONE OF THESE PAGES WOULD SUFFICE TO CONTAIN THE FRUITS OF HIS DAY'S WORK
AND DOES IT NOT STRIKE YOU THAT MY STAYING HERE ON THE CONTRARY WOULD--WOULD TEND TO PREVENT THE KIND OF CONVERSATION YOU SPEAK OF NOT THE LEAST DEAR RADIE--THAT IS I MEAN IT COULD HAVE NO POSSIBLE EFFECT UNLESS THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE FIRST SUPPOSED AND THEN IT COULD BE OF NO APPRECIABLE USE
YOURS SINCERELY M
BUT IT WAS ANSWERED
THANK GOD MISS SAID OLD TAMAR LIFTING UP HER TREMBLING FINGERS AND WHITE EYES TO HEAVEN
HE HAD RETURNED TO GYLINGDEN DIRECT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD FROM HIS CONFERENCES WITH MARK WYLDER TO TELL ALL CONCERNED THAT IT WAS VAIN ENDEAVOURING TO TRACE HIM AND STILL OFFERING HIS DISINTERESTED SERVICES IN THE PURSUIT
NOT A HUNDRED YARDS REMOVED FROM IT AND WITH AN EAGER RECOGNITION I GAZED ON THE NOBLE FRONT OF THE OLD MANORIAL HOUSE
CHAPTER XLI
AND RACHEL WAS FOR A MOMENT INDESCRIBABLY RELIEVED BY STANLEY'S DEPARTURE
TWENTY-EIGHT POUNDS FOURTEEN SHILLINGS AND EIGHT PENCE
AND THE MAJOR DEVILISH UNCOMFORTABLE ACCOMPANIED HIM AT A SMART PACE TO THE GREAT GATE OF BRANDON
HOW NOBLE HOW GOOD HOW BRIGHT AND TRUE WAS THAT HERO OF HER UNCONSCIOUS ROMANCE
I THINK THAT BLUE IMPROVES IT WONDERFULLY
IT REACHED LAKE FROM TOM TWITTERS OF HIS CLUB WHO KEPT THE BRANDON CAPTAIN AU COURANT OF THE TOWN-TALK
HIS DOING SO PLACES HIM IN THE SAME INTEREST WITH US
HE COULD NOT SAY THAT HE RECOGNISED ANYTHING DISTINCTLY--ONLY HE FANCIED THAT SOME ONE HE KNEW WAS SITTING THERE UNREVEALED INSIDE THAT MASS OF CLOTHING
OUR SHIP WAS AT NAPLES WHEN SHE WAS THERE TWO YEARS AGO
I KNOW IT IS ALTOGETHER A FALSEHOOD
THEY HAD NOT WALKED TOGETHER VERY FAR WHEN STANLEY RECOLLECTED THAT HE MUST TAKE HIS LEAVE AND WALK BACK TO GYLINGDEN
DO YOU REALLY THINK YOUR FRIEND MR WYLDER CARES ABOUT ME I TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED
WELL IT WAS PRETTY--FRENCH I DARE SAY--A LITTLE SET OF TABLETS--A TOY--THE COVER OF ENAMEL STUDDED IN SMALL JEWELS WITH A SLENDER BORDER OF SYMBOLIC FLOWERS AND WITH A HEART IN THE CENTRE A MOSAIC OF LITTLE CARBUNCLES RUBIES AND OTHER RED AND CRIMSON STONES PLACED WITH A VIEW TO LIGHT AND SHADE
SUDDEN ARRIVALS AND PASSING PILGRIMS LIKE ME LEANING OVER THE PALING AND REFRESHED BY THE GLIMPSE THE ROGUE STEALS OF THIS CHARMING ORATORY
THE TIME WAS GROWING SHORT
YOU ARE LOOKING PALE--YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ILL
NO OTHER SOUND BUT THE MELANCHOLY SOUGHING OF THE NIGHT-BREEZE AND THE HOARSE MURMUR OF THE STREAM RISING FROM THE STONY CHANNEL OF REDMAN'S DELL WERE NOW OR DURING THE REMAINDER OF HIS WALK THROUGH THESE HAUNTED GROUNDS AGAIN AUDIBLE
I WILL BE FIRM--IT IS MY DUTY TO CLEAR THIS MATTER UP IF I CAN--WE MUST DO AS WE WOULD BE DONE BY CHAPTER LI
MRS CRUTCHLEIGH STAYED HER STEP UPON THE STAIRS ABRUPTLY AND TURNED WITH A LOOK OF FIERCE SURPRISE UPON HER LEAN WHITE-HEADED LORD ARRESTING THEREBY THE UPWARD MARCH OF CORFE CRUTCHLEIGH ESQ THE HOPE OF HIS HOUSE WHO WAS PULLING ON HIS GLOVES WITH HIS ELDEST SPINSTER SISTER ON HIS LANK ARM
MARK--HA--HA--HARK--HA--HA--HA--HARK--MARK--MARK--HA--HA--HARK WHO'S THERE CRIED THE ATTORNEY IN A TONE RATHER FEROCIOUS FROM FRIGHT AND STAMPING ON THE PATH
YOU CAN'T SUPPOSE THAT SHE COULD NOT MARRY MUCH BETTER AND IF YOU HAVE NOT MADE UP YOUR MIND TO BREAK OFF OF WHICH THE WORLD WOULD FORM BUT ONE OPINION YOU HAD BETTER NOT SPEAK IN THAT WAY ANY MORE WHY IT WAS ONLY TO YOU CHARLIE AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I DO BELIEVE IT IS THE BEST THING FOR ME
STILL IT WAS TOO PRODIGIOUS AND TOO HAZARDOUS TO BE PROBABLE
I FANCIED HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DIFFERENTLY PLACED BUT MISS BRANDON DID NOT SEEM CONSCIOUS OF HIS ABSENCE AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE HANDSOME BLONDE WOULD HAVE BEEN AS WELL PLEASED IF HE HAD BEEN ANYWHERE BUT WHERE HE WAS
I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS SO LATE SAID RACHEL
THIS WAS HIS BROTHER WILLIAM THE VICAR
IT WAS QUITE HOPELESS AND POOR LARKIN PRESSED TOO
AND I'LL WAIT A LITTLE OH
UP THE BROAD STRAIGHT AVENUE WITH ITS SOLEMN FILES OF GIGANTIC TIMBER TOWERING AT THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT HAND THE CHAISE ROLLED SMOOTHLY AND THROUGH THE FANTASTIC IRON GATE OF THE COURTYARD AND WITH A FINE SWINGING SWEEP AND A JERK WE DREW UP HANDSOMELY BEFORE THE DOOR-STEPS WITH THE WYLDER ARMS IN BOLD AND FLORID PROJECTION CARVED ABOVE IT
HE LIFTED HER HEAD BY THE EAR AND LET IT FALL BACK
AND AS HER GUARDIAN I CANNOT AVOID TELLING HER SHOULD I FAIL TO HEAR EXPLICITLY FROM YOU WITHIN THREE DAYS FROM THIS DATE THAT SHE IS AT LIBERTY TO HOLD HERSELF ACQUITTED OF HER ENGAGEMENT TO YOU
HE WAS VERY CLOSE--VERY RUMINATED LARKIN
HE WAS LOOKING UP AT A WINDOW WITH A COUPLE OF SOOTY SCARLET GERANIUMS IN IT
I WON'T
I WON'T
THEY TRY NOT TO BLOW BUT I NEVER LET THEM ALONE TILL THEY DO
SHE WAS HE THOUGHT EVEN MORE LOVELY THAN HE REMEMBERED HER
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU WISH TO BE ACCESSORY TO ALL THIS AND THEREFORE IT BEHOVES YOU RACHEL TO DO WHAT YOU CAN TO PREVENT IT
I'M BAD AT GENEALOGIES
ON THAT NIGHT MISS LAKE THE 29TH SEPTEMBER YOU DROVE IN MR MARK WYLDER'S TAX-CART TO THE DOLLINGTON STATION WHERE NOTWITHSTANDING YOUR VEIL AND YOUR CAUTION YOU WERE SEEN AND RECOGNISED
I'M AFRAID I HAVE LED YOU TOO FARTHER THAN YOU INTENDED SHE FANCIED THAT HER SUDDEN CHANGE OF PLAN ON MEETING HER BROTHER WOULD APPEAR ODD
AND NOW RACHEL YOU KNOW HER AND YOU MUST SAY A GOOD WORD FOR ME
IT SAID MY DEAR CAPTAIN BRANDON LAKE,--IMPERATIVE BUSINESS CALLS ME TO LONDON BY THE EARLY TRAIN TO-MORROW
A NICE MESS YOU HAVE MADE OF IT AMONG YOU ARE YOU BETTER DORCAS SAID RACHEL
MR LARKIN HAD A WAY OF GENTLY COMPRESSING HIS UNDER-LIP BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB--A MILD PINCH A REFLECTIVE CARESS--WHEN CONTEMPLATIONS OF THIS NATURE OCCUPIED HIS BRAIN
MY DEAR MISS LAKE SAID THAT GOOD LITTLE WOMAN SKIPPING TO HER SIDE
BUT I MEANT OTHER THINGS
I HAD NO IDEA MARK WYLDER'S TASTE WAS SO EXQUISITE YES VERY MAGNIFICENT I SUPPOSE HOW CHARMING--QUITE REGAL--YOU WILL LOOK DORCAS DORCAS SMILED STRANGELY AND HER BOSOM HEAVED A LITTLE RACHEL THOUGHT
FOR TWO OR THREE SECONDS I LITERALLY COULD NOT MOVE
AT THE POST-OFFICE WINDOW HE TAPPED WITH THE SILVER TIP OF HIS CANE AND TOLD MISS DRIVER WITH A SLEEPY SMILE I'M GOING DOWN TO REDMAN'S FARM AND ANY LETTERS FOR MY SISTER MISS LAKE I MAY AS WELL TAKE WITH ME EVERYBODY IN BUSINESS IN THE TOWN OF GYLINGDEN BY THIS TIME KNEW CAPTAIN LAKE AND HIS BELONGINGS--A MOST RESPECTABLE PARTY--A HIGH MAN
MY JOURNEY THOUGH BY RAIL AND AS EASY AS THAT OF THE PERSIAN GENTLEMAN WHO SKIMMED THE AIR SEATED ON A PIECE OF CARPET PREDISPOSED ME TO SLEEP
THE POSSIBILITIES WERE POSITIVELY DAZZLING
THE BEST METHOD OF HIDING YOUR OPINION OR YOUR MOTIVES FROM SUCH MEN IS TO TELL IT TO THEM
HE MUST WALK ALONE BY THE SHOP-DOORS--WHERE THE LITTLE MAN WAS SO ADMIRED--AND UP THE MILL-ROAD AND IN THE CASTLE MEADOW AND OVER THE STILE WHERE THEY USED TO SIT
HOW SMOOTHLY AND SIMPLY EVERYTHING WOULD GO IF ONLY MEN WOULD STICK TO TRUTH
CHELFORD CANNOT LIKE HER
HE LISTENED
AND SHE SICKENED
YOU WANT NO ADVICE
COME RACHEL SHALL WE ESCAPE FROM THE SPELL AND THE DESTINY INTO SOLITUDE
I'VE HEARD OF YOUR COMING HERE AND SENDING SO OFTEN THEY SAT DOWN SIDE BY SIDE AND DORCAS HELD HER HAND
COME WHAT WILL YOU LEAVE ME
PRAY READ YOUR LETTERS AND DON'T MIND ME I ENTREAT
THIS IS A CRITICAL MATTER DO YOU SEE AND IF IT WERE KNOWN IN THIS PLACE THAT YOUR YOUNG MISTRESS HAD GONE AWAY AS SHE HAS DONE--THOUGH QUITE INNOCENTLY--UPON MY HONOUR--I THINK IT WOULD BLAST HER
HANG IT I CAN'T PULL IT OFF--I'M GROWING AS FAT AS A PIG--BUT THEY ARE LIKE A QUEER LITTLE STRING OF FLOWERS
THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE
I PERCEIVED IT--AND I THINK I CAN'T BE MISTAKEN
WELL PERHAPS I HAVE FORMED AN OUTLINE OF A PLAN AND IT STRIKES ME AS VERY WELL I HAVE--FOR I DON'T THINK YOU ARE LIKELY TO TAKE THAT TROUBLE
WHAT CYCLOPEAN CARPENTERS
ON THE OTHER HAND THE MORE MR LARKIN RELIED UPON THE TRUTH OF DUTTON'S LETTER THE COOLER HE BECAME RESPECTING THE PURCHASE OF FIVE OAKS
I LOOK FOR HIS RETURN EVERY DAY--EVERY HOUR INDEED--AND NO DOUBT HIS ABSENCE WILL TURN OUT TO HAVE BEEN UNAVOIDABLE
AND HE THINKS--HE THINKS--HE'LL BE HERE SOON AGAIN--OH HERE IT IS MR LARKIN HAD BEEN FUMBLING FIRST IN HIS DEEP WAISTCOAT AND THEN IN HIS BREAST-POCKET AS IF FOR THE LETTER WHICH WAS LOCKED FAST INTO THE IRON SAFE WITH CHUBB'S PATENT LOCK IN HIS OFFICE AT THE LODGE
I AM AT THE BRANDON ARMS TILL TO-MORROW SAID LAKE WITH WHITE LIPS VERY QUIETLY TO THE GENTLEMAN IN MOUSTACHES WHO BOWED SLIGHTLY AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH SIR HARRY
THE UPPER SKY HAD STILL A FAINT GRAY TWILIGHT HALO AND THE STARS LOOKED WAN AND FAINT
THEN I GREW ANGRY AT HAVING BEEN PUT INTO SUCH REMOTE AND POSSIBLY SUSPECTED QUARTERS AND THEN MY COMFORTABLE SCEPTICISM SUPERVENED
OF COURSE THE LADY SAW THAT LANK AND SINISTER MAN OF GOD QUITE DISTINCTLY BUT SHE DID NOT CHOOSE TO DO SO AND LARKIN WITH A GRAND SORT OF PRESCIENCE FORESAW A COUNTY FEUD BETWEEN THE HOUSES OF FIVE OAKS AND BRANDON AND NOW THE LADY HAD VANISHED
NO ONE AT SUCH A MOMENT MINDED HIS MAUNDERINGS
SHOULD HE LIVE TO SEE THE EVENING
THIS WAS MR LARCOM--THE GRAVE MAJOR DOMO THE BLAND AND ATTACHED BUTLER
BUT RACHEL WAS NEVER LONG OVERWHELMED BY ANY SHOCK--FEAR WAS NOT FOR HER--HER BRAVE SPIRIT STOOD HER IN STEAD
IT SEEMED TO ME SIMPLY THAT STANLEY LAKE WAS A LIVELY AMUSING AND EVEN INTELLIGENT MAN WITHOUT ANY INTERNAL RESOURCE
CAPTAIN LAKE TAKES AN EVENING STROLL ABOUT GYLINGDEN
AND NOT BEING A READY MAN THOUGH GIVEN TO BANTER HE SOMETIMES DESCENDED TO MENACE IN HIS JOCULARITY
AT FIRST HE DID NOT MIND
I'LL TALK TO HIM
THE VERY PRIESTESS OF DESPAIR
WELL DORCAS DEAR I AM UTTERLY AMAZED
YOU KNOW RACHEL LAKE I'VE NOT THE HONOUR OF KNOWING MISS LAKE
BECAUSE I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND A WEEK AGO TO PUT AN END TO THIS ODIOUS ENGAGEMENT
LET US TRY THE REVEREND WILLIAM WYLDER WAS OFTEN AT THE LODGE NOW
WYLDER IS INCITING HIM AND WILL REAP THE BENEFIT OF IT
AND ALSO BY ACCOSTING ME WHOM AS ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN AGREEING TO IMPOSE THESE CONDITIONS HE WAS NEVER TO ADDRESS I FELT MYSELF AT LIBERTY TO MENTION IT TO YOU HOLDING THE RELATION YOU DO TO ME AS WELL AS TO HIM IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DESIRABLENESS OF PLACING YOU IN POSSESSION OF THE TRUE CAUSE OF HIS ABSCONDING WHICH WAS SIMPLY MY TELLING HIM THAT I WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM SLURRED AS HE WAS TO MARRY A LADY WHO WAS TOTALLY IGNORANT OF HIS ACTUAL POSITION
I QUITE FORGOT MR LARKIN SAID HE
BE SO GOOD TO HAND MY LAWYER MR JOS
IF INDEED HE FELT HIS INFERIORITY AND OWNED HIS DEPENDENCE I THINK I MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE CALLED HIM MY HONEY MY LOVE AND MY DEAR AND ENCOURAGED AND COMFORTED HIM
THIS WAS THE CLAMPCOURT GHOST AND I BELIEVE HE WAS LEFT IN THAT DEBATABLE STATE AND NEVER AFTER EITHER EXPLODED OR CONFIRMED
ONLY IN JUSTICE TO MARK I MUST SAY THAT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SO SHAMELESS A DRAWER OF THE LONG-BOW AS THE VENETIAN GENTLEMAN AND OFFICER
YOU ARE NEVER TO CALL ME YOUR FRIEND MIND THAT
LORD CHELFORD WAS NOT LONG AWAY WHEN THE STORY OF LADY CONSTANCE WAS AGAIN ALIVE AND VOCAL
I'LL SIT IN THE PORCH IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME DORCAS
THE DEEPENING SHADOW WARNED DORCAS THAT IT WAS TIME TO REPAIR TO THE DUTCH ROOM WHERE SHE FOUND LIGHTS AND TEA PREPARED
BUT I HAD TO GET ROUND THE POOL A CONSIDERABLE CIRCUIT
AND THAT TO MR.--A--A--YOUR VISITOR A GLANCE AT ME IT CAN'T BE VERY INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO THIS KIND OF--OF--CONVERSATION WHICH IS NEITHER VERY ENTERTAINING NOR VERY WISE I AM ANSWERABLE ONLY FOR MY PART OF IT
TWO OF THEM IN YELLOW LETTERS BORE RESPECTIVELY THE LABEL BRANDON NO
IS HE EVER ANGRY WHEN HE LAUGHS--IS HE WAPSIE--OH WAPSIE IS HE
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE SORT OF SWAGGER WITH WHICH THE WRITING MARCHED ACROSS THE PAGE LAKE MIGHT HAVE SEEN HERE AND THERE A LITTLE QUAVER--INDICATIVE OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM HASTE--THE VIBRATIONS OF ANOTHER SORT OF FLURRY
CAPTAIN LAKE WAS A GENTLEMAN AND AN OFFICER AND OF COURSE AN HONOURABLE MAN
I DID NOT KNOW HE HAD LEFT HOME IT'S STRANGE HE SHOULD NOT HAVE CONSULTED YOU
AND INDEED THEY HAD SOME CAUSE
THE PEOPLE THERE KNEW THE LAWYER VERY WELL
BUT IT IS HARD TO KNOW ANY MAN FOR CERTAIN IN THIS WORLD
AND WE EACH KNOW OUR OWN AFFAIRS YOU YOURS AND I MINE BEST THERE WAS SOMETHING BY NO MEANS PLEASANT IN HIS COUNTENANCE WHEN HIS TEMPER WAS STIRRED AND A LITTLE THING SOMETIMES SUFFICED TO DO SO
A NEGRO CAME TO ME A BLACK CLERGYMAN WITH WHITE EYES AND REMAINED BESIDE ME
AND WHEN HIS OWN LITTLE CANARY--'BIRDIE HE USED TO CALL HIM--WOULD SING AND TWITTER IN HIS CAGE--AND THE TIME CAME TO WALK OUT ON HIS LONELY VISITS
HIS TREASURE--HIS ORACLE--HIS BOOK OF POWER THE LABELLED PARCEL OF WYLDER'S LETTERS WITH THE ANNOTATED MAP FOLDED BESIDE THEM--HE REPLACED IN THEIR RED-TAPED LIGATURE IN HIS IRON SAFE AND WITH CHUBB'S KEY IN HIS POCKET TOOK HIS HAT AND CANE--THE DAY WAS FINE--AND WALKED FORTH FOR BRANDON AND THE CAPTAIN'S STUDY
I CAN'T THE LEAST SAY WHETHER IT WAS ALTOGETHER FANCY
AND SILENT AS THE DEAD IN CHARON'S BOAT AWAY THEY GLIDED TOWARD THE WHITE HOUSE WHICH LAY UPON THE HIGH ROAD TO DOLLINGTON
YOU'LL NOT BE ANGRY MASTER STANLEY DEAR
IT SHOULD NEVER MOVE FROM THAT--NOR HIS DRUM--NOR THAT LITTLE HAT AND CAPE HANGING ON THEIR PEG WITH THE TINY BOOTS UNDERNEATH
SHE TURNED AND CARESSINGLY SMOOTHED THE GOLDEN TRESSES OVER RACHEL'S FRANK WHITE FOREHEAD AND KISSED THEM AS SHE DID SO
BURLINGTON SMITH AND CO SOLICITORS GREW UP AND EXPANDED WITH A TROPICAL LUXURIANCE
LOOK AT IT DO MR WYLDER--ISN'T IT LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS WYLDER WAS LAUGHING RATHER REDLY WITH THE UPPER PART OF HIS FACE VERY SURLY I THOUGHT
YOUR DUTIFUL AND LOVING SERVANT TAMAR SO OLD TAMAR AFTER A LITTLE TOOK HER DEPARTURE
IN THIS HE WAS INTENSELY IN EARNEST FOR THE CONNECTION WOULD HAVE DONE WONDERS FOR CAPTAIN LAKE IN THE COUNTY
AT YOUR CONFOUNDED GRUMBLING MARK
LARCOM ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE MISS LAKE AND CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY THAT YOUNG LADY PASSED THE GRIM OLD PHANTOM ON THE LOBBY
OH STANLEY IT IS A LOAD UPON MY CONSCIENCE--A MOUNTAIN--A MOUNTAIN BETWEEN ME AND MY HOPES
MINE HAVE BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT IN WHICH I WAS TAKEN INTO A CONFIDENCE SO DREADFUL
BUT FIRST PROMISE SO HELP YOU HEAVEN YOU WILL KEEP MY SECRET I DO PROMISE INDEED DORCAS I SWEAR I'LL NOT REPEAT ONE WORD YOU TELL ME IT HAS BEEN A VAIN STRUGGLE
IT WAS NO PROCESS OF REASON OR PHILOSOPHY BUT SIMPLY I BECAME PERSUADED OF IT AND SOMETHING LIKE RAGE OVERCAME MY TERRORS
SO AM I SAID THE LEARNED BUDDLE
I HOPE HE DOES NOT BULLY HER IN TRUTH THERE WERE IN HER EXQUISITE FEATURES THE TRACES OF THAT MYSTERIOUS MISERY AND FEAR WHICH SEEMED TO FALL WHEREVER STANLEY LAKE'S ILL-OMENED CONFIDENCES WERE GIVEN
FOR IF THE GOOD ATTORNEY WAS CAUTIOUS HE WAS ALSO GREEDY AND WOULD TAKE POSSESSION AS EARLY AS WAS SAFE
THE JURY WERE NOT SWORN UNTIL TWO O'CLOCK
SECRET
I'M HERE YOU KNOW IN LOCO PARENTIS_;--MY MOTHER AND I KEEP WATCH AND WARD
WHEN THE ESTATES ARE JOINED IN ONE THEY'LL BE GOOD ELEVEN THOUSAND A YEAR
HERE WAS ANOTHER WOULD-BE CORRESPONDENT OF MARK'S FOILED FOR WANT OF HIS ADDRESS
MERCIFUL HEAVEN
IF UNDER THESE DEPLORABLY UNTOWARD CIRCUMSTANCES YOU STILL THINK I CAN BE OF ANY USE TO YOU MAY I BEG THAT YOU WILL NOT HESITATE TO SAY HOW
DID I SAY
BUT I COULD NOT
WHAT SHE READ THERE--WHAT PROCESSION OF THOUGHTS AND IMAGES PASSED BY--THREW NEITHER LIGHT NOR SHADOW ON HER FACE
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE FEARFUL
AND I THINK WHEN ANOTHER SUCH YESTERDAY SHALL HAVE ARRIVED WHERE SHALL I BE
THERE WAS WATER SPILT ON THE TABLE AND THE FRAGMENTS OF A BROKEN GLASS UPON THE FLOOR
HE DRESSED IN IT READ HIS NEWSPAPER THERE AND THERE SAW HIS SELECT ACQUAINTANCE
HE COULD HIT A WALKING-CANE AT FIFTEEN YARDS AT THE WORD
BUT IT DOES NOT AMOUNT TO THAT THOUGH IT WON'T BENEFIT ME FOR HE SETTLED THAT WHEN I DIE IT SHALL GO TO HIS RIGHT HEIRS--THAT WILL BE TO MY SON IF I EVER HAVE ONE
THEY LEAVE LONDON AT FIVE AND GET TO DOLLINGTON AT HALF-PAST TEN AND DRIVER NEVER HAS THEM IN SOONER THAN TWENTY MINUTES PAST ELEVEN
THE LITTLE BUTTER-COOLER OF A GLASS LAMP GLIMMERED FROM THE ROOF
RURAL FAMILIES OF EMINENCE CAME IN
IT COULD HARDLY BE THAT_--DECENCY HAD NOT YET QUITE TAKEN LEAVE OF THE EARTH
AND THE GOOD LITTLE BODY TO THE AMAZEMENT OF HER TWO MAIDS WOULD BE HEARD PASSIONATELY WEEPING IN THE PARLOUR IN HER FORSAKEN STATE
THE IMMENSE FUTURITY BEYOND THAT COULD NOT BE SHIRKED TO WHICH SHE WAS CERTAINLY GOING
HE WAS PERFECTLY WELL
LAKE'S OBJECT BEING TO INDUCE MARK TO ABANDON HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH DORCAS BRANDON
IT'S A LONG TIME SIR SINCE I HAD THE HONOUR OF SEEING YOU
HE WAS READING LITTLE FAIRY'S DEATH WARRANT
OR IS IT THAT YOU DON'T CARE TO SEARCH HIM TOO NARROWLY OR HAVE NOT TIME
AT LAST DOCTOR BUDDLE OFFICIALLY INTERFERED
IN LIKE MANNER TOO THE GOOD AND SKILFUL PARSON COMES BY EXPERIENCE TO KNOW THE SIGNS AND STAGES OF THE MORAL AILMENTS AND RECOVERIES WHICH SOME OF THEM KNOW HOW SO TENDERLY AND SO WISELY TO CARE FOR
I SCORN YOUR THREATS--I DEFY YOU STANLEY LAKE LOOKED TRANSPORTED AND THE YELLOW FIRES OF HIS DEEP-SET EYES GLARED ON HER WHILE HIS LIPS MOVED TO SPEAK BUT NOT A WORD CAME AND IT BECAME A CONTORTION
IN A LITTLE WHILE IN COMES LORD CHELFORD ALWAYS NATURAL AND PLEASANT AND QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS PEERAGE--HE WAS ABOVE IT I THINK--AND CHATTED AWAY MERRILY WITH THAT HANDSOME ANIMATED BLONDE--WHO ON EARTH COULD SHE BE?--AND DID NOT SEEM THE LEAST CHILLED IN THE STIFF AND FROSTED PRESENCE OF HIS MOTHER BUT WAS GENIAL AND PLAYFUL EVEN WITH THAT SPIRIT OF THE FROZEN OCEAN WHO RECEIVED HIS AFFECTIONATE TRIFLING WITH A SORT OF SMILING THOUGH WINTRY PRIDE AND COMPLACENCY REFLECTING BACK FROM HER ICY ASPECTS SOMETHING OF THE ROSY TINTS OF THAT KINDLY SUNSHINE
AND WHEN IT WAS OVER WE BLESSED THEM
SOMETHING TOO MIGHT BE LEARNED BY NOTING LAKE'S LOOKS DEMEANOUR AND LANGUAGE UNDER THIS DIRECT COMMUNICATION FROM THE MAN TO WHOM HIS RELATIONS WERE SO MYSTERIOUS
BUT SOMETHING IS--I WILL NOT SAY THREATENED--BUT I MAY SAY MOOTED WHICH WERE ANY ATTEMPT SERIOUSLY MADE TO CARRY IT INTO EXECUTION WOULD I REGRET TO SAY INVOLVE VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES TO A PARTY WHOM FOR I MAY SAY MANY REASONS I SHOULD REGRET BEING CALLED UPON TO AFFECT UNPLEASANTLY AND PRAY MR LARKIN CAN I BE OF ANY USE EVERY USE MISS LAKE AND IT IS PRECISELY FOR THAT REASON THAT I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF WAITING UPON YOU AT WHAT I AM WELL AWARE IS A SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL HOUR PERHAPS MR LARKIN YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD AS TO CALL IN THE MORNING--ANY HOUR YOU APPOINT WILL ANSWER ME SAID THE YOUNG LADY A LITTLE STIFFLY
YOU MENTIONED CAROLINE BEAUCHAMP BUT I DON'T SEE HOW YOUR VISIT HERE COULD HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH THAT PLAN BUT DON'T YOU THINK RADIE I SHOULD DO WELL TO MARRY THAT IS ASSUMING EVERYTHING TO BE SUITABLE WELL PERHAPS FOR YOURSELF STANLEY
IT WAKENS UP THE FROZEN SPIRIT OF ENJOYMENT AND LEADS THE SAD FACULTIES FORTH ON A WILD FORGETFUL FROLIC
I DON'T QUITE APPREHEND
THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS OH YES
FROM TWO O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT THE ACTION OF HIS SKIN HAS COMMENCED AND NEVER CEASED SINCE
FEAR HATH TORMENT--AND FEAR IS THE WORST INGREDIENT IN MENTAL PAIN
BUT IT WAS CONDITIONED THAT THE SAID STANLEY WILLIAMS LAKE WAS NOT TO DEAL WITH THE SAID LANDS EXCEPT WITH THE CONSENT IN WRITING OF THE SAID DORCAS C WHO WAS TO BE A CONSENTING PARTY TO THE DEED
HE HAD HARDLY EXPECTED TO SEE HER HERE IN THIS ROLLICKING RUSTIC GATHERING
AND OLD LADY CHELFORD AT THE WORD SHOT A GLEAM OF CONTEMPTUOUS TRIUMPH AT MISS DORCAS
I DO NOT THINK THERE ARE MANY MEN WHO IN MY SITUATION WOULD HAVE FELT VERY DIFFERENTLY
AND TELL DORCAS WITH DOZENS OF LOVES I WOULD WRITE TO HER BUT HAVE NOT A MINUTE FOR THE TRAIN
IF MASTER STANLEY SHOULD CALL HE IS TO DO JUST AS HE PLEASES
BUT THE CLOTHIER COULD NOT AND HIS BROUGHAM WHIRLED HIM AWAY TO NAUNTON FRIARS
TABLETS IN BRASS MARBLE-PILLARED MONUMENTS AND A COUPLE OF LIFE-SIZED KNIGHTS ARMED CAP-A-PIE ON THEIR BACKS IN THE AISLE
ARE YOU IN HIS SECRETS AT ALL SOMETHING IN HIS CONFIDENCE I SHOULD HOPE SAID MR LARKIN IN RATHER A LOFTY AND RESERVED WAY
WELL TAMAR WHERE'S YOUR STORY SAID THE YOUNG LADY
I CAN'T ENDURE THE MISERY TO WHICH YOU WOULD CONSIGN ME
AND IF YOU DO ANYTHING SO INSANE SURE I AM YOU'LL RUE IT WHILE YOU LIVE
AT THAT MOMENT WE HEARD A VOICE CALLING AND RAISING OUR EYES SAW UNCLE LORNE LOOKING DOWN FROM THE ROCK WITH AN AGITATED SCOWL
MORE THE FIRST YEAR
DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A FOOL
HE HAS TERRIFIED HER
I'LL BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU TO-MORROW IF YOU CAN CONVENIENTLY LOOK IN--SAY AT TWELVE OR HALF-PAST TO REPORT PROGRESS SO THAT WAS ARRANGED
BUT I COULD NOT PASS BY WITHOUT A WORD EVEN AT THE RISK OF INTERRUPTING YOU
A BURLY ROLL OF CLOAKS RUGS CAPES AND LOOSE WRAPPERS PLACED IN THE CORNER AND TANQUAM CADAVER PASSIVE AND MOTIONLESS
AN HOUR AFTER CAPTAIN STANLEY BRANDON LAKE WHOSE ELECTION ADDRESS WAS FIGURING THAT EVENING IN THE DOLLINGTON COURIER AND IN THE COUNTY CHRONICLE LAY WITH HIS CLOTHES STILL ON IN THE LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM OF REDMAN'S FARM HIS INJURIES ASCERTAINED HIS THIGH BROKEN NEAR THE HIP AND HIS SPINE FRACTURED
HE WAS VERY VAIN OF HIS TEETH--HIS ONLY REALLY GOOD POINT--FOR HIS EYES WERE A SMALL CUNNING GRAY PAIR
WELL YOU KNOW HE LEFT BRANDON WITH SOME CHARGES TO MY COUSIN DORCAS
HE HAD PUSHED MATTERS FORWARD WITH WONDERFUL DESPATCH
I CAN'T EXPLAIN TO HER ALL MY REASONS FOR DECLINING
AND WHEN SHE TURNED TO OLD TAMAR WHO BROUGHT IN HER TINY TEA EQUIPAGE IT SEEMED AS IF THE SHADOW OF THE DELL INTO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN VACANTLY GAZING STILL RESTED ON HER FACE
IF THERE BE POWERS EITHER IN HEAVEN OR HELL IT SEEMS LIKE A DEFIANCE AND AN INVOCATION
THE FOOT OF MY BED LAY TOWARDS THE WINDOW DISTANT AT LEAST FIVE-AND-TWENTY-FEET
AND THAT A LONG BETROTHAL NOT BEING DESIRABLE ON THE WHOLE MISS BRANDON'S RELATIVES THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE THAT THE ENGAGEMENT SHOULD TERMINATE AND HAD SO DECIDED MR WYLDER HAVING VERY PROPERLY PLACED HIMSELF ABSOLUTELY IN THEIR HANDS
CHAPTER I
AND YOU MAY RELY UPON IT YOU WILL HAVE A MUCH LONGER TIME AT ALL EVENTS THAN THEY ARE DISPOSED TO ALLOW YOU CHAPTER XXXIII
MY BLESSED LITTLE MAN
LET IT COME--MY RESOLUTION IS TAKEN STANLEY WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND IN HIS EASY WAY AS HE WOULD ACROSS A DRAWING-ROOM TO STAND BY A PIANO AND HE LOOKED OUT UPON THE TREES WHOSE TOPS STOOD MOTIONLESS AGAINST THE DARKENED SKY LIKE MASSES OF RUINS
LARKIN WOULD HAVE GIVEN LARGE MONEY FOR AN ENGINE TO GET UP WITH THE TRAIN THAT WAS NOW SOME FIVE MILES ON ITS ROUTE AT TREBLE QUADRUPLE THE COMMON COST OF SUCH A MAGICAL APPLIANCE
MANY A WISER MAN THAN I HAD BEEN MYSTIFIED BY DYSPEPSIA AND MELANCHOLIC VAPOURS
EVERY NOW AND THEN AS I TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR I FANCIED I SAW IT SOFTLY CLOSE
THE DEVIL FIXED HIM PRECISELY THERE FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF FLEECING AND WATCHING AND THREATENING HIM--PERHAPS WORSE
THE FACT IS CAPTAIN LAKE OUR POOR FRIEND THE VICAR YOU KNOW THE REV
WE JUST CAUGHT THE UP TRAIN HE SAYS HE'LL BE BACK AGAIN ON SATURDAY I SAID
MY DEAR SIR I ONLY WISH I COULD
THERE HAS CUM A LETER FOR A SERTUN PERSEN THIS MORNING WITH A LUNDUN POSMARK AND I DO NOT NOW HAND NOR SELE BUT BAD WRITTING WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN WOT CONTANES BUT I MAY FOR AS YOU TOLD ME OFFEN YOU ARE ANCEUS FOR WELFARE OF OUR FAMLY AS I NOW TO BE NO MORE THAN TREWTH SO I AM ANCEUS TO ASCEST YOU SIR WICH MY CONSEYNCE IS SATESFID BUT LETER AS TRUBELED A SERTUN PERSEN OUFULL HOO I NEW WAS ENGRY AND LOOK OUFULL PUT ABOUT WICH DO NOT OFFEN APEN AND YOU MAY SEWER THERE IS SUMTHING IN WIND HE IS ALDAY SO OUFULL PEEFISH YOU WILL NOT THING WORSE OF ME SPEEKEN PLANE AS YO DISIER THERE BEEING A DEEL TO REGRET FOR FRENDS OF THE OLD FAMLY I FEER IN A SERTUN RESENT MARREGE IF I SHUD LERN BE CHANCE CONTENSE OF LETTER I WILL SEWER RITE YOU.--I REMANE YOUR HUMBEL SERVANT JOHN LARCOM JUST AS GRAVE MR LARCOM HAD ENDED THE PERUSAL OF THIS BULLETIN HE HEARD A LIGHT STEP ON THE STAIR AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE WHICH MADE HIS MANLY HEART JUMP UNPLEASANTLY WITHIN HIS FAT RIBS
FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS SINCE THEN HOW MY DAYS HAVE FLOWN
IN FACT IT WAS A ROUGH BUT POWERFUL LIKENESS--STARTLING AT THE MOMENT--UNEXCEPTIONABLE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE--BUT WHICH FAILED ON A NEARER AND EXACTER EXAMINATION
HE SEEMED TO THINK--YES--IT WOULD BE ONLY A DAY OR SO
I WAS QUITE SURE SHE BOTH THOUGHT AND FELT AND COULD TALK TOO IF SHE CHOSE IT
COULD IT BE STANLEY
I FIND IN MY DIARY A NOTE--'CHELFORD TELLS ME IT IS WRITTEN IN OLD SURVEYS WYLDERTON AND WAS ONE OF THE HOUSES OF THE WYLDERS
I'VE HAD SUCH A LONG WALK ACROSS THE PARK
WE DECLINED WINE AND WATER AND ALL OTHER CREATURE COMFORTS
OLD MAJOR JACKSON KEPT THE YOUNG LADIES IN PRACTICE BETWEEN WHILES WITH HIS BARREN GALLANTRIES AND GRACES AND WAS JUST SO FAR BETTER THAN NOTHING
AYE IN ITALY
HE WRITES IN A VIOLENT PASSION AND I'M REALLY PLACED IN A MOST DISAGREEABLE POSITION WON'T YOU SIT DOWN A--THANKS--A--WELL I THOUGHT ON THE WHOLE HAVING RECEIVED THE LETTER AND THE ENCLOSURE WHICH I MUST SAY VERY MUCH SURPRISES ME--VERY MUCH INDEED AND LARKIN LOOKED REPROVINGLY ON AN IMAGINARY MARK WYLDER AND SHOOK HIS HEAD A GOOD DEAL
VERY WISE--EXACTLY
BUT THE POOR VICAR WAS IN RATHER URGENT CIRCUMSTANCES JUST THEN AND HIS TROUBLES HAD CLOSED IN RECENTLY WITH A NOISELESS BUT TREMENDOUS CONTRACTION LIKE THAT IRON SHROUD IN MR MUDFORD'S FINE TALE
I'D LIKE TO SEE RACHEL AT LAST HE SAID HOLDING CHELFORD'S HAND IN BOTH HIS VERY HARD
AND THEN RISING UP WITH PITEOUS LOOK IN HER OLD NURSE'S FACE SHE SAID OH
RACHEL YOU MUST TRY TO LIKE ME SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HER COUSIN'S NECK AND RACHEL FELT IN HER EMBRACE THE VIBRATION OF AN AGONY
UP CHURCH-STREET I CONTRIVED A PEEP AT THE OLD GRAY TOWER WHERE THE CHIMES HUNG
AND IF A WYLDER WHY WAS IT BRANDON HALL
NOT THAT EXACTLY MISS LAKE BUT ONLY THAT I MUST SPEAK TO-NIGHT--IN FACT I HAVE NO CHOICE
TO-MORROW MORNING I WILL SEE DORCAS--POOR DORCAS!--AND TELL HER ALL
SHE THOUGHT
I DON'T--I WISH TO SPARE YOU
THERE WERE INFLUENCES OF A WHOLLY UNSUSPECTED KIND ALREADY GATHERING ROUND THE POOR VICAR WILLIAM WYLDER
AND PALE WITH DREARY EYES AND THIN HIGH NOSE SAT IN A HIGH-BACKED CARVED OAK THRONE WITH RED CUSHIONS
AND THE BRANDONS HAD INTERMARRIED WITH OTHER HOWARDS AND FIVE OAKS WOULD NATURALLY THEREFORE GO TO HOWARDS
YOU LIKED HIM WELL ENOUGH ONCE THE YOUNG LADY COLOURED RATHER FIERCELY
AND I DARE SAY NOTWITHSTANDING MY OTHER REASONS HAD THE LADIES AT THE HALL BEEN ALL EITHER OLD OR UGLY I WOULD HAVE MADE GOOD MY RETREAT TO THE VILLAGE HOTEL
AND AS HE HAD FIVE CLIENTS ON THIS OCCASION THE TOTAL REACHED L67 10_S LEAVING A CLEAR PROFIT AS I HAVE MENTIONED OF L62 7_S ON THIS ITEM
ON THE NIGHT WHEN MARK WYLDER HAD LEFT BRANDON IN HIS COMPANY THEY HAD SOME ANGRY TALK
AND VISIONS OF THE GRAND JURY ROSE DIM AND SPLENDID--AN HEIRESS AND A SEAT FOR THE COUNTY
OH YES OF COURSE IN SERIOUS MATTERS
ON A SUDDEN THE BED-CLOTHES WERE GENTLY LIFTED AT MY FEET AND I SPRANG BACKWARDS SITTING UPRIGHT AGAINST THE BACK OF THE BED AND ONCE MORE UNDER THE GAZE OF THAT LONG-CHINNED OLD MAN
BUT CERTAIN ANXIETIES OF A RATHER GHASTLY KIND AND SPECULATIONS AS TO WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON IN LONDON JUST THEN WERE ROUND HIM AGAIN LIKE ARMED GIANTS IN ANOTHER MOMENT AND THE RICHES OR HYPOCRISY OF HIS HOST WERE NO MORE TO HIM THAN THOSE OF OVERREACH OR TARTUFFE
200_L 23RD FEB C
NO STANLEY NOW_--FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE NOW
BUT MANY PEOPLE AFTERWARDS THOUGHT THAT THE CRAZED OLD MAN IN ONE OF HIS NIGHT-RAMBLES HAD SEEN THAT WHICH TILL NOW NO ONE HAD IMAGINED
AND I THINK YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME FOR THE PRESENT FOR TO SAY TRUTH I DO NOT FEEL VERY WELL GOOD-NIGHT RADIE--GOOD-NIGHT OLD TAMAR
THE MAN PLAINLY HAD NOT EXPECTED TO PRODUCE ANY SUCH RESULT AND LOOKED VERY QUEER
BUT I AM TIRED AND AS YOU ARE SO KIND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR OFFER OF THE CARRIAGE LARCOM HAD THAT MOMENT APPEARED IN THE VESTIBULE AND RECEIVED THE ORDER
CHAPTER LXVIII
NOTHING AFFECTED HIM SO MUCH AS THAT KIND OF UNKINDNESS
HE CERTAINLY NEVER WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE FOR ME
IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GREAT TERRITORIAL INFLUENCE OF THE BRANDON FAMILY WILL OBTAIN A CONSIDERABLE ACCESSION IN THE ESTATES OF THE BRIDEGROOM IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND THERE WAS SOME MORE WHICH I NEED NOT COPY BEING VERY LIKE WHAT WE USUALLY SEE ON SUCH OCCASIONS
I AM SATISFIED
AND SUCH DIFFICULTIES WERE NOT DISADVANTAGEOUS TO A CLEVER AND FIRM PERSON WHO MIGHT RENDER HIMSELF VERY NECESSARY TO AN EMBARRASSED PRINCIPAL WITH PLENTY OF MONEY
WE'LL SEND HOME FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT
THERE WAS A SILENCE DURING WHICH PALE CAPTAIN LAKE LOCKED UP MARK WYLDER'S WARNING AND THE ATTORNEY TWICE CLEARED HIS VOICE
WHAT DAY OF THE MONTH IS THIS SAID DORCAS
AND REALLY RADIE YOU'RE MAKING MOUNTAINS OF MOLE-HILLS
YES SAID LAKE IN THE SAME MOCKING TONE THAT WAS LOW AND SWEET AND EASILY MISTAKEN FOR SOMETHING MORE AMIABLE
IT ALMOST ANSWERS WITH HIMSELF
IN THE MEANTIME DORCAS YOU CANNOT LIKE MY COMPANY BECAUSE YOU DO NOT LIKE ME
WHAT WAS IT SAID DOLLY STARING WITH ROUND EYES IN THE OLD WOMAN'S WOEFUL FACE HER CURIOSITY AROUSED FOR A MOMENT
IT WAS PROBABLY WELL THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH SHACKLED WITH CONSIDERATIONS OF THAT PARTICULAR KIND IN THE IMPORTANT NEGOTIATION ABOUT FIVE OAKS
WYLDER ENCLOSED WAS AN ORDER ON LAKE FOR 150_L WHEN LARKIN GOT THIS HE WAS IN HIS STUDY
JAMES DUTTON TOO
YOU SAID RIGHT JUST NOW
IN THE SAME WAY MISS BRANDON WITH LORD AND LADY CHELFORD WAS SEEN NEXT SUNDAY SERENE AND UNCHANGED IN THE GREAT CARVED OAK BRANDON PEW RAISED LIKE A DAIS TWO FEET AT LEAST ABOVE THE LEVEL OF MERE CHRISTIANS WHO FREQUENTED THE FAMILY CHAPEL
I SOMETIMES THINK HE IS MAD RADIE I COULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED SUCH A THING
AND I DON'T THINK I'LL GO BACK RADIE YOU SHALL GO BACK SIR AND CARRY MY MESSAGE
BUT IT IS THE HAND OF GOD THAT IS UPON YOU AND LIKE ME YOU WILL SAY AT LAST IT IS GOOD FOR ME THAT I HAVE BEEN IN TROUBLE LIE DOWN DEAR MISS RADIE AND I'LL READ TO YOU THE BLESSED WORDS OF COMFORT THAT HAVE BEEN SEALED FOR ME EVER SINCE I SAW YOU LAST
IT WAS THAT ODIOUS SIR HARRY BRACTON--WAS NOT IT WHY SO ODIOUS RACHEL
LORD CHELFORD WAS INDEED APPROACHING ONLY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
IT'S AS TRUE AS YOU STAND THERE--_OUR MOTTO
AND EVEN IF I WERE WHERE'S THE GOOD IN ANGRY FEELING OR REPROACHES NOW DON'T YOU SEE WHEN I CAN'T MEND IT
IN WHICH FRAME OF MIND HE TOOK FROM HIS COAT POCKET A COPY OF CAPTAIN LAKE'S MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT AND READ OVER AGAIN A COVENANT ON THE CAPTAIN'S PART THAT WITH RESPECT TO THIS PARTICULAR ESTATE OF FIVE OAKS HE WOULD DO NO ACT AND EXECUTE NO AGREEMENT DEED OR OTHER INSTRUMENT WHATSOEVER IN ANY WISE AFFECTING THE SAME WITHOUT THE CONSENT IN WRITING OF THE SAID DORCAS BRANDON
I DO BELIEVE SAID THE GOOD VICAR AS HE WALKED DOWN WHAT MR LARKIN CALLED THE APPROACH AND LOOKING UP WITH IRREPRESSIBLE GRATITUDE TO THE BLUE SKY AND THE WHITE CLOUDS SAILING OVER HIS HEAD IF IT BE NOT PRESUMPTION I MUST BELIEVE THAT I HAVE BEEN DIRECTED HITHER--YES DARLING YES MY HANDS ARE WARM THIS WAS ADDRESSED TO LITTLE FAIRY WHO WAS CLAMOURING FOR INFORMATION ON THE POINT AND CLINGING TO HIS ARM AS HE CAPERED BY HIS SIDE WHAT IMMENSE RELIEF AND HE MURMURED ANOTHER THANKSGIVING AND THEN QUITE HILARIOUSLY IF LITTLE MAN WOULD LIKE TO COME WITH HIS WAPSIE WE'LL TAKE SUCH A NICE LITTLE WALK TOGETHER AND WE'LL GO AND SEE POOR WIDOW MADDOCK
AND MOREOVER WHEN HE AGAIN ESSAYED HIS SUIT THE YOUNG LADY HAD PEREMPTORILY MADE UP HER MIND TO DANCE NO MORE THAT NIGHT
AND OF IT HE WAS NOW SURE
AND IN THE MIDST OF HER PRATTLE WAS PEEPING AT THE LANDMARKS OF THEIR PROGRESS
AND I FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE QUITE RUINED IF I WERE TO FORFEIT YOUR GOOD OFFICES
IT COULD NOT BE SAID TO BE LOVE
FOR THE ATTORNEY INTENDED TO KEEP THAT GENTLEMAN VERY QUIET
THE UNSPEAKABLE SADNESS OF WOUNDED PRIDE WAS ON HER BEAUTIFUL FEATURES AND THERE WAS A FONDNESS IN THE GESTURE WITH WHICH SHE LAID HER FINGERS ON THESE EXOTICS AND STOOPED OVER THEM WHICH GAVE TO HER SOLITUDE A SENTIMENT OF THE PATHETIC
REMEMBER IT'S I THE ONLY ONE ON EARTH WHO STANDS NEAR YOU IN KINDRED YOUR SISTER STANLEY WHO IMPLORES OF YOU TO TAKE THIS STEP BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE
IT SAID MISTER LARKINS,--RESPECKTED SIR I WRITE YOU SIR TO LET YOU KNOW HAS HOW THERE IS NO MORE CHANCE YOU SHUD EAR OF POOR MR MARK WYLDER--OF HOSE ORRIBLE DEATH I MAKE BOLD TO ACQUAINTE YOU BY THIS WRITING--WHICH IS SECRET HAS YET FROM ALL--HE BING HID AND MADE AWAY WITH IN THE DARK
AS I WENT DOWN I HEARD MISS LAKE CHATTING WITH HER QUEEN-LIKE COUSIN NEAR AN OPEN DOOR ON THE LOBBY
I PROTEST IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN AGAINST IT AND YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE NOW WILLIAM WITH MY OFFER BEFORE YOU
IT WAS TO REQUEST HIS IMMEDIATE ATTENDANCE AT REDMAN'S FARM TO SEE CAPTAIN LAKE WHO WAS IN A MOST ALARMING STATE
BUT HE'LL BE BACK AGAIN ON SATURDAY AND IN THE MEANTIME DESIRES ME TO LAY HIS HEART AT YOUR FEET DORCAS
YOU AND I HAVE OUR NOTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GENTLEMANLIKE AND PROFESSIONAL--A--AND GENTLEMANLIKE AS I SAY--HEAVEN FORBID QUITE SO SAID CAPTAIN LAKE GENTLY
PERHAPS YOUNG LADIES FRIENDSHIPS ARE NEVER VERY ENDURING
AND THIS I WILL SAY RADIE IF I HAD KNOWN THE WORST I THINK EVEN THAT WOULD NOT HAVE DETERRED ME
BUT YOU SHALL NOT IN THE MEANTIME GO TO THE WALL FOR WANT OF ADVICE
IT IS AN ANGEL WHO COMES DOWN AND TROUBLES THE WATER WHAT A HEAVENLY EVENING SAID A LOW SWEET VOICE BUT WITH SOMETHING INSIDIOUS IN IT CLOSE AT HIS SHOULDER
LARKIN BY THE FIRM WHO THOUGH RATHER LAMELY EXONERATED THEMSELVES AS HAVING BEEN QUITE TAKEN IN BY THE GYLINGDEN ATTORNEY
IF ONE COULD ONLY SEE IT THE MANOEUVRING AND THE ULTIMATE COLLISION OF TWO SUCH GENERALS AS HE AND LAKE WOULD BE WORTH OBSERVING
ON REFLECTION YOU'LL SAY SO
THE BUTLER NODDED GLOOMILY
I KNOW NOT
AND I SHOULD NOT WISH ON CONSIDERATION TO SPEAK TO ANY OFFICIAL PERSON
HOW THEY COME WEARING FOR EVER THE SWEETEST AND PLEASANTEST LOOK OF THEIR EARTHLY DAYS
HE EXPECTS TO BE HOME IN TWO MONTHS TIME
ON MY ARRIVAL I WAS SANGUINE ABOUT FINDING HIM
I HESITATE TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION EVEN WITH YOU
SO SUBSTANTIALLY VALUABLE IS A THOROUGH ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE CAPABILITIES OF THE LAW
AND THIS HAPPENED EVERY NOW AND AGAIN UNTIL I HAD QUITE EXHAUSTED MY BUDGET AND THEN I DID OPEN IT AND LOOKED STRAIGHT TO THE SIGNATURE
WELL I THINK SHE HAS BEEN MORE THAN USUALLY REPULSIVE--QUITE MARKED
I NEVER SAW YOU READ A LETTER SO SERIOUS-LIKE BEFORE
STILL IN A RATHER FLURRIED WAY PROSECUTING HIS CONJUGAL ATTENTIONS
AND WOULD OWE HER ON SATURDAY NEXT TWENTY-FIVE GUINEAS
I DO BELIEVE BEELZEBUB EMPLOYS THEM STILL AS HE DID IN EDEN FOR THE SPECIAL PLAGUE OF US POOR DEVILS
MY JOURNEY IS OVER FOR THE PRESENT SIR AND PERHAPS YOU WOULD FIND THESE LITTLE THINGS ENTERTAINING AND HE TENDERED WITH THE SAME SMILE PUNCH THE PENNY GLEANER AND GRAY'S MAGAZINE A RELIGIOUS SERIAL
THE CAPTAIN STOPPED ALSO AND LOOKED AT HER WITH A STARE WHICH I SUPPOSE HAD SOMETHING FORBIDDING IN IT FOR THE CHILD WAS FRIGHTENED
IT IS NOTHING ON EARTH TO ME
A NASTY CASE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE HE'LL CERTAINLY NOT GO POOR FELLOW BEFORE FOUR O'CLOCK P.M
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE IT HAS GONE THAT LENGTH QUITE
YOU AND THEY GO CAPITALLY TOGETHER--SO SOLEMN AND ELOQUENT AND GODLY--CAPITAL FELLOWS
OTHER SPIRITUAL TROUBLES TOO THERE ARE
IF THERE WAS REALLY SOMETHING UNSOUND IN THE STATE OF LAKE'S RELATIONS AND THAT HE COULD BE GOT TO CONSIDER LAWYER LARKIN AS A FRIEND WORTH KEEPING THAT ESTATE MIGHT BE HAD A BARGAIN--YES A GREAT BARGAIN
TAMAR WAS DRESSED JUST AS SHE USED TO BE WHEN SITTING IN THE OPEN AIR AT HER KNITTING EXCEPT THAT OVER HER SHOULDERS SHE HAD A THIN GRAY SHAWL
IN WHICH SIR FRANCIS SEDDLEY MANIPULATES
I CAN'T SERVE YOU
HE COULD NOT RISE--HE COULD NOT STIR
HE'S HER BROTHER AND SHE PAUSED
YOURS DEAR LARKIN VERY TRULY BUT LOOK AFTER MY BUSINESS BETTER M
THIS KINDNESS HOWEVER SHE DECLINED
IT IS ALL HORRIBLE WICKEDNESS
ANYTHING CERTAIN--_ANY THING WOULD BE BETTER LITTLE FAIRY GREW GRAVE IN SPITE OF THE ATTORNEY'S SMILES WHENEVER HE SAW HIM
YOU WERE ANGRY AND RAISED YOUR VOICE
I THINK MY VEXATION IS VERY NEAR ENDED
IT IS A POEM AND A REVERIE
MY JOURNEY WAS FROM LONDON
ONE EVENING STANLEY LAKE STOOD AT HER DOOR
HE GLIDED UP HER NARROW STAIR AND LET HIMSELF IN BY THE LATCH
NOW OF THIS LITTLE DOOR HE HEARD THE TWO IRON BOLTS STEALTHILY DRAWN AND THEN THE HANDLE OF THE SPRING LOCK TURNED AND THE DOOR CAUTIOUSLY OPENED AND AS GENTLY CLOSED
IN VIRTUE OF SOME MYSTERIOUS HARMONIES IT IS THE IMAGE OF GOD AND MUST WE FEEL ENCLOSE THE GOD-LIKE
AND WHERE IS THE NOTICE HE SPEAKS OF HERE WHY REALLY CAPTAIN LAKE I DID NOT VERY WELL KNOW IT IS SUCH A PRODUCTION--I COULD NOT SAY WHETHER YOU WOULD WISH IT PRESENTED
AND I MAY SAY IF I WERE SUPPOSED TO BE EVER SO SLIGHTLY ENGAGED IN THESE RISKY THINGS IT WOULD BE THE RUIN OF ME
I COULD NOT COMPREHEND THE SITUATION THAT WAS FORMING
AND HOW JUSTLY HIGH IT DESERVES TO HOLD ITS HEAD AMONGST THE PROVINCIAL EMPORIA OF OUR PRODUCTIVE INDUSTRY THE SHAPELESS TRAVELLER IN THE CORNER TOUCHED HIS EAR WITH HIS PUDGY DOGSKIN FINGERS AND SHOOK HIS HAND AND HEAD A LITTLE IN TOKEN EITHER THAT HE WAS DEAF OR THE NOISE SUCH AS TO PREVENT HIS HEARING AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT THE GLITTERING EYES CLOSED AND THE PANTOMIMIST APPEARED TO BE ASLEEP
YOU HAVE BEEN DUPED
BY JOVE HE'S KILLED I THINK LAKE GROANED
OUT OF THE HEART PROCEED MURDERS_;--THESE DREADFUL REALITIES SHAPE THEMSELVES FROM SO FILMY A MEDIUM AS THOUGHT
FOR BETWEEN OURSELVES DICKIE POOR FELLOW WAS NOT ALWAYS PLEASANT TO DEAL WITH
TIMBER LIKE THE BRANDON OAKS AND MONUMENTS LIKE THESE--THESE ARE THINGS WHICH WHATEVER ELSE HE MAY ACQUIRE THE NOVUS HOMO CAPTAIN BRANDON LAKE--THE PARVENU_--CAN NEVER COMMAND MR JOS
I'LL READ JUST A PASSAGE OR TWO IF YOU'LL PERMIT ME
AND WHERE'S THE GOOD OF MONEY I SAY IF YOU CAN'T ENJOY IT AND MR WYLDER LOOKED POETICALLY UNHAPPY AND TRUNDLED OVER A LITTLE BIT OF FRICANDEAU ON HIS PLATE WITH HIS FORK DESOLATELY AS THOUGH EARTHLY THINGS HAD LOST THEIR RELISH
THERE WAS SIR JONATHAN BRANDON FOR INSTANCE WHO RAN HIS OWN NEPHEW THROUGH THE LUNGS IN A DUEL FOUGHT IN A PAROXYSM OF CENCIAN JEALOUSY
AND IT'S GUILT GUILT BUT MY FATE AND I'LL GO AND YOU'LL NEVER THANK ME
YOU ARE SO SENSIBLE AND YOU HAVE BEEN REALLY SO VERY KIND I ASSURE YOU I APPRECIATE IT RADIE--I DO INDEED
THAT SHE WAS TO BE PUBLICLY STIGMATISED AND PUNISHED
BUT RACHEL FELT THAT THE FASHION OF HER COUNTENANCE TOWARDS HER WAS CHANGED
SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO WRITE HIM ONE OF THOSE TERSE COURTEOUS BITING NOTES FOR WHICH SHE WAS FAMOUS
THIS CAN'T BE HE BUT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE IMPRESSION ON MR JOS
YOU MUST BE CAUTIOUS
YOU WILL BE HAPPIER WHEN YOU HAVE DISCLOSED THE TRUTH AND RELEASED AT ALL EVENTS ONE OF YOUR VICTIMS
HE DID NOT IMITATE A GENTLEMAN HAPPILY AND WAS NEVER SO VULGAR AS WHEN HE WAS FINEST
AND THE DOCTOR RAZOR IN HAND LISTENED WITH WIDE OPEN EYES AND HALF HIS FACE LATHERED TO THE STORY
MY MIND IS ALTOGETHER DARK AND TURBID
IT WAS DULL WORK
YES MY MEMORY HAD SERVED ME RIGHT
YOU HAD BETTER WRITE YOUR PROPHECIES IN YOUR ROOM SIR--HAD NOT YOU?--AND GIVE THEM TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY TO PROCLAIM WHEN THEY ARE FINISHED
LOW FELLOWS ARE ALWAYS TALKING
SO SOON AS HE WAS ONCE MORE CONCEALED BY THE SCREEN OF UNDERWOOD OLD TAMAR NOW SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED CREPT HURRIEDLY AWAY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION HALF DEAD WITH TERROR UNTIL SHE HAD DESCENDED THE STEPS AND WAS BURIED ONCE MORE IN FRIENDLY DARKNESS
THE PRINCESS BY THIS TIME WAS SEATED ON THE OTTOMAN AND CHOSE TO READ A LETTER THUS INTIMATING I SUPPOSE THAT MY AUDIENCE WAS AT AN END
HE MUST HAVE NO FOOTING IN EITHER TILL I RETURN
WOULD YOU DISLIKE MY SMOKING A CIGAR RADIE OH NO ANSWERED THE YOUNG LADY WITH A LITTLE LAUGH AND A HEAVY SIGH FOR SHE KNEW IT MEANT SILENCE AND HER DARK AUGURIES GREW DARKER
A SOLITARY CANDLE BEING PLACED TO MAKE THINGS BRIGHT AND PLEASANT FOR THE VISITOR WHO DID NOT LOOK SO HIMSELF THE VICAR VERY PALE AND APPEARING TO HAVE GROWN EVEN THINNER SINCE HE LAST SAW HIM ENTERED AND SHOOK HIS HAND WITH AN ANXIOUS ATTEMPT AT A SMILE WHICH FADED ALMOST INSTANTLY
SHE WAS LOOKING WITH A STRANGE LIGHT UPON HER FACE--A SMILE PERHAPS--UPON THE OPEN PAGES OF MOORE'S MELODIES AS HE SPOKE
ANYTHING NO MATTER WHAT--A GHOST OR A MURDER OLD TAMAR SHOOK HER HEAD
I'VE A NOTION OF RUNNING UP TO TOWN ONLY FOR A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THIS BUSINESS COMES OFF JUST ON THE SLY
WHAT CONSIDERABLE PEOPLE THOSE WYLDERS WERE AND WHAT AN ANTIQUE STOCK AFTER THIS HE WISHED TO MAKE A VISIT TO THE VICAR AND SO WE PARTED COMPANY
AND I MAY SAY CONSIDERING WHO I AM--AND MY YEARS--AND THE MANNER IN WHICH I AM USUALLY TREATED I AM A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THE TONE IN WHICH YOU ARE PLEASED TO QUESTION ME THESE LAST TERRIBLE REMARKS TOTALLY FAILED TO OVERAWE THE SERENE TEMERITY OF THE GRAVE BEAUTY
SHE'S WILLING TO GO AND WISHIN FOR DEATH THIS MANY A DAY
THAT'S VERY ODD
LARKIN HAD NO APPREHENSIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE DEALING
AND FEEL THAT ALL THE TIME I AM A VILE IMPOSTOR STAINED INCREDIBLY FROM WHOM IF THEY KNEW ME THEY WOULD TURN IN HORROR AND DISGUST
AND WHAT I NOW HAVE TO DO IS TO GUARD MYSELF IF POSSIBLE FROM WHAT I'M THREATENED WITH SHE FANCIED SHE SAW HIS PALE FACE GROW MORE BLOODLESS EVEN IN THE SHADOW WHERE HE SAT
WON'T YOU SIT DOWN--NO BAD NEWS
WILLIAM WYLDER AND HIS RESPECTABLE FAMILY AND A PROPOSITION WHICH HE AS MY CLIENT MENTIONED TO ME THIS EVENING
HIS RELIGION WAS OF A COMFORTABLE PUNCTUAL BUSINESS-LIKE CAST WHICH ACCORDING WITH HIS GENIUS--DENIED HIM INDEED SOME THINGS FOR WHICH IN TRUTH HE HAD NO TASTE--BUT IN NO RESPECT INTERFERED WITH HIS MAIN MISSION UPON EARTH WHICH WAS GETTING MONEY
IN THAT STATE IT WAS HE REACHED REDMAN'S FARM AND HIS INTERVIEW WITH RACHEL OCCURRED
MAYBE HE WRITES NOT UNDER PHYSICAL BUT MORAL COERCION
HERE THERE WAS FAINT MOONLIGHT AND STARLIGHT VERY WELCOME
AND THAT CAPTAIN LAKE HIMSELF WHOSE DISLIKE OF HIM WAS HARDLY DISGUISED SUSPECTED HIM AT TIMES OF THAT ALARMING KNOWLEDGE
DON'T FORGET THAT VERY GLAD
BUT MARK I THOUGHT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS LAUGHTER AND GENERAL JOLLITY WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
BUT AS IT HAD BEEN FOR YEARS WELL ASCERTAINED THAT HE EITHER COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY AND THAT HIS LOVE PASSAGES LIKE THE PASSAGES IN GOTHIC PILES THAT LEAD TO NOTHING WERE NOT DESIGNED TO TERMINATE ADVANTAGEOUSLY HE HAD LONG CEASED TO EXCITE EVEN IN THAT DESOLATE REGION THE SMALLEST INTEREST
NO I ASSURE YOU I'M NOT JOKING
OPEN THE WINDOW STANLEY
MY DEAR--IT IS TIME THE BRANDONS SHOULD GROW LIKE OTHER PEOPLE
AND WHEN IT DISAPPEARED SHE SIGHED AGAIN HEAVILY STILL LOOKING IN ITS TRACK
AND ITS TO-INGS AND FRO-INGS ON TIP-TOE
HE HAD BEGUN TO GROW MORE HOPEFUL
BUT THERE WERE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE--JIM DUTTON WAS RATHER A TALLER AND EVERY WAY A LARGER MAN THAN MARK WYLDER
SOME ONE TWO OR THREE PERHAPS DO YOU THINK IT'S TRUE SIR PERSISTED MR LARKIN
THE EVENING PAPERS FOR THE DAY BEFORE LAY ON THE BREAKFAST TABLE
THE HALL-DOOR WAS NOW SHUT AND BOLTED
FIFTY FELLOWS I KNOW ARE IN MUCH WORSE FIXES
THE MASK FALLS
YOU ARE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING BUT OF HURTING YOURSELF
I DON'T THINK MORTAL EVER SUFFERED HORROR MORE INTENSE
YOUR REFUSAL WOULD ALMOST MAKE ME MAD
AND SO SOFTLY CLOSING HER DOOR SHE LEFT HER TO HER QUEER VISIONS AND DEATHLIKE SLUMBER
THAT MARK WYLDER WAS LIVING WAS THE GRAND FACT WITH WHICH HE HAD JUST THEN TO DO
HIS COUNTENANCE CHANGED AND HE BECKONED AS IF TO SOME ONE IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM BEHIND US AND SMILED HIS DREADFUL SMILE AND SO LEFT THE APARTMENT
THE CAPTURED BRACTON BANNERS WERE TO HANG IN THE COFFEE-ROOM OF THE SILVER LION TO INSPIRE THE ROUGHS
STANLEY LAKE LOOKED FOR A MOMENT DISPOSED TO BREAK INTO ONE OF HIS FURIES BUT INSTEAD HE ONLY LAUGHED HIS UNPLEASANT LAUGH
BUT I AM MUCH MISTAKEN OR SHE WILL HERSELF ON HALF-AN-HOUR'S CALM CONSIDERATION SEE THE MORAL IMPOSSIBILITIES WHICH INTERPOSE BETWEEN HER TO ME MOST AMAZING PLAN AND ITS REALISATION THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE HERE DURING WHICH THE TREAD OF THEIR FEET ON THE SOFT GRASS ALONE WAS AUDIBLE
AND IF HE WENT TO LONDON DISAPPOINTED AND THAT THINGS TURNED OUT UNLUCKILY ABOUT DUTTON IT MIGHT BE A VERY AWFUL BUSINESS INDEED
BUT THE QUESTION WHICH NEXT AROSE WAS VERY PERPLEXED--WAS THE BODY THAT OF MR MARK WYLDER
FOR SOME MINUTES THEY WERE SILENT
CHAPTER LXV
MR LARKIN'S HEART STOOD STILL FOR A MOMENT AND THEN BOUNDED UP AS IF IT WOULD CHOKE HIM
PUT IT ON THE TABLE SAID RACHEL COLLECTED NOW BUT PALE AND SOMEWHAT STERN
LARKIN IF HE DID NOT MARCH HIM OUT TO DO HIM JUSTICE HAD HAD NO HAND IN PRIMARILY BRINGING HIM THERE
I DON'T CARE A CURSE WHAT HE WAS REJOINED MARK
WHY HIS BROTHER MARK COULD GET HIM CLEVERLY OUT OF IT--COULD NOT HE WHEEZED THE PORK-BUTCHER
IT WAS IN FACT ONE OF THOSE BRISK AND BRIGHT MORNINGS WHICH PROCLAIM A UNIVERSAL CHEERFULNESS AND MOCK THE MISERIES OF THOSE DISMAL WAYFARERS OF LIFE TO WHOM RETURNING LIGHT IS A RENEWAL OF SORROW WHO BOWING TOWARD THE EARTH RESUME THEIR DESPAIRING MARCH AND LIMP AND GROAN UNDER HEAVY BURDENS UNTIL DARKNESS WELCOME COMES AGAIN AND THEIR EYELIDS DROP AND THEY LIE DOWN WITH THEIR LOADS ON LOOKING UP A SILENT SUPPLICATION AND WISHING THAT DEATH WOULD TOUCH THEIR EYELIDS IN THEIR SLEEP AND THEIR JOURNEY END WHERE THEY LIE
AND SAYS HE'S THAT OLD SIR LORNE BRANDON THAT SHOT HIMSELF IN HIS BED-ROOM
SHE GIVES ME THE HORRORS I ASSURE YOU WHENEVER I LOOK AT HER
BUT WHAT WOULD HAVE BECOME OF THE VICAR IF HE HAD NOT BEEN RAISED UP TO PURCHASE
BUT THE DOUBT HAD LED MR JOS
BUT DO YOU THINK MR LARKIN REALLY SUPPOSES THAT POOR MARK IS DEAD I DO DEAR--I SUSPECT HE KNOWS IT AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT RACHEL DARLING I CAN'T DEFINE--I'VE NO PROOFS TO GIVE YOU
WE ARE OLD FRIENDS NOW--YOU'LL FORGIVE ME CALLING YOU RACHEL--IT MAY BE PERHAPS THE LAST TIME RACHEL WAS STANDING THERE WITH SUCH A BEAUTIFUL BLUSH AND DOWNCAST EYES AND HER HAND IN HIS
IT EXPRESSED ITSELF ENIGMATICALLY
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HIS ABSENCE
THEN CAPTAIN LAKE ASKED TO SEE THE BILLIARD-MARKER WHO WAS LIKELY TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HIM
SHADOWS WERE STANDING ABOUT THAT LONELY BED ALREADY
AND WHO KNOWS WHERE THE ESTATE WOULD HAVE BEEN BY THIS TIME I BELIEVE CHARLIE HE RECOMMENCED SUDDENLY THERE IS NOT SUCH AN UNNATURAL FAMILY ON RECORD AS OURS
YOURS TRULY MARK WYLDER NOW THERE CERTAINLY WAS NEED OF WYLDER'S ASSURANCE THAT NOTHING UNPLEASANT SHOULD HAPPEN TO THE CONSCIOUS BEARER OF SUCH A MESSAGE TO AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN
AND YOU HAVE GONE INTO ELECTIONEERING BUSINESS AND FORMED CONNECTIONS OF THAT SORT WITHOUT ONCE DOING ME THE HONOUR TO CONFER WITH ME ON THE SUBJECT
I GRANT ALL THAT
MARK WYLDER IS IN AN EVIL PLIGHT SAID HE
IN FOUR WEEKS HE WAS OUT RATHER PALE AND LANGUID BUT STILL ABLE TO WALK WITHOUT DIFFICULTY LEANING ON A STICK FOR TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES AT A TIME
AND SHADING HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND HE SCRUTINISED THE NUMERALS--'28TH AGAIN;--'A TOTALLY DIFFERENT INK
GOOD-NIGHT DEAR RADIE
I TELL YOU STANLEY I FEEL THAT YOU DESIGN EMPLOYING ME IN SOME OF YOUR CROOKED PLANS
HAD NOT SALMON OF I KNOW NOT HOW MANY POUNDS WEIGHT BEEN PLAYED AND BROUGHT TO LAND BY THAT SLENDER TOWAGE
AND I KNEW MISS BRANDON WOULD NOT FORGIVE ME IF I ALLOWED HIM TO GO AWAY WITHOUT COMING HERE
WITH THIS WENT A PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL NON-OFFICIAL NOTE TO SMITH DESIRING HIM TO ANSWER STIFFLY AND PRESS FOR AN IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT AND TO CHARGE COSTS FAIRLY AS MR WILLIAM WYLDER WOULD HAVE AMPLE FUNDS TO LIQUIDATE THEM
THEN HE CAME BACK AS GENTLY AS HE HAD GONE AND STOOD BESIDE HIS SISTER
HE SAYS HE DID BUSINESS FOR YOUR UNCLE ONCE
DO THEY ENTERTAIN THE NEIGHBOURS EVER AT BRANDON SOMETIMES WHEN OLD LADY CHELFORD AND HER SON ARE STAYING THERE BUT THE NEIGHBOURS CAN'T ENTERTAIN THEM I FANCY OR YOU
OH STANLEY--POOR STANLEY GASPED RACHEL WITH WHITE LIPS
MARK HAD PLENTY OF ODD AND NOT UNAMUSING LORE
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
THERE WAS A STING OF COMPUNCTION--A YEARNING--AND THEN STARTED A FEW BITTER AND SOLITARY TEARS
BUT I NOW KNOW VERY WELL THAT FROM THE FIRST IT WAS QUITE SETTLED THAT DOWN I SHOULD GO
AND BEFORE THE WINDOW STOOD MY DRESSING-TABLE AND ON IT A LARGE LOOKING-GLASS
LORD GEORGE READY TO JOIN AND GO HALVES
HE WAS SITTING AT THIS MOMENT ON THE BILLIARD TABLE WITH HIS COAT OFF AND HIS CUE IN HIS HAND AND HAD LIGHTED A CIGAR
BUT SHE'LL BE BETTER SHE SAYS IN THE AFTERNOON AND HOPES TO COME UP HERE TO SEE YOU AND MISS BRANDON THIS EVENING LORD CHELFORD AND I HAD A PLEASANT WALK THAT DAY TO THE RUINS OF WILLERTON CASTLE
AND HE TOLD FITZSTEPHEN ON SUNDAY AFTER CHURCH THAT HE'D NEVER SIT AGAIN HERE BY JOVE IS A LETTER FROM MOWBRAY SAID LAKE OPENING IT
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A PURPOSE--WILL YOU EVER LEARN TO BE FRANK AND STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SPEAK PLAINLY TO THOSE WHOM YOU OUGHT TO TRUST IF NOT TO LOVE
BUT I FEAR YOU ARE TIRED'--HE LOOKED VERY KINDLY ON HER PALE FACE--'AND YOU KNOW IT WILL COST YOU A WALK OF MORE THAN TWO MILES I FORGOT--YES--I BELIEVE I AM A LITTLE TIRED
AND TOM WEALDON THE TOWN CLERK WAS SUCH A SPIRIT
INDEED HE WON'T EAT ANYTHING AND YOU SEE THE LIGHT HURTS HIS EYES
WHAT A CHARMING EVENING SAID THE VICAR MAKING AN EFFORT AT CHEERFULNESS
WHAT CAN IT NOW BE TO YOU OR ME--WHY
YOU'RE GOING HOME I SUPPOSE RADIE YES--OH YES--BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL GO THIS WAY
A MOST INTERESTING CHILD
LARKIN MENTIONED IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE VICAR JUST RELATED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED A POWER OF ATTORNEY FROM MARK WYLDER
CHELFORD WAS TO GIVE THE BEAUTIFUL HEIRESS AWAY
AND OLD TAMAR YOU KNOW SUCH A FIGURE
HE SAW THE PORK-BUTCHER IN HIS BACK-PARLOUR AND HAD A FEW WORDS TO SAY ABOUT THE CHAPEL-TRUST AND HIS LOOKS AND TALK WERE QUITE EDIFYING
THE NOTE WHICH BY THIS TIME THE VICAR HAD RECEIVED THOUGH SHORT WAS ON THE WHOLE TREMENDOUS
HE HAS SEEN THE PLACES WHICH YOU ARE YET TO SEE NOTHING I SHOULD LIKE BETTER
AND I WOULD HAVE SECURED THE DOOR BUT THERE WAS NO SORT OF FASTENING WITHIN
THERE IS THAT AWFUL MR BUGGS SAID DOLLY WITH A LOOK OF HONEST ALARM
SHALL I TELL YOU YES STANLEY--YES
IT WAS THE OLD QUESTION ABOUT ROGERS THE BREWER AND WHETHER LORD ADLESTON AND SIR WILLIAM COULD NOT GET HIM
LARKIN LOOKED UP AND LAKE LAUGHED IN HIS FACE QUIETLY THE MOST IMPERTINENT LAUGH HE HAD EVER SEEN OR HEARD WITH HIS YELLOW EYES FIXED ON THE LAWYER'S PINK LITTLE OPTICS
AND I GRIEVE TO SAY THEY ADD THAT IN THE EVENT OF THE THING FALLING THROUGH THEY WILL ISSUE EXECUTION FOR THE AMOUNT OF THEIR COSTS WHICH AS I ANTICIPATED A GOOD DEAL EXCEEDS FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS
LARKIN HAD A SMATTERING OF SCHOOL LATIN AND KNEW HALF-A-DOZEN FRENCH WORDS WHICH HE TOOK OUT ON OCCASION
YES IT IS TO LORD CHELFORD SAID THE ATTORNEY WITH A GRAND SORT OF SUAVITY--HE LIKED LORDS--PLACING IT AFTER A SCRUTINY IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
YET PERHAPS I WAS WRONG
AND I WAS GLAD I HAPPENED TO DROP IN AT THE MOMENT OF ACTION AND WISHED TO SEE THE PLAY OUT
IS LORD CHELFORD WITH HIM YES MISS PLEASE THEN TELL HIM I WILL BE SO OBLIGED IF HE WILL COME HERE FOR A MOMENT WHEN THE DOCTOR IS GONE
HA HA HA
WON'T YOU BELIEVE ME DARLING THEN IF IT BE SO STANLEY I THINK WE SHOULD HESITATE LONG BEFORE SELLING ANY PART OF THE ESTATE UPON A MERE CONJECTURE OF DANGER
THE MEETING IN THE LONG POND ALLEY
AT LAST THE GALLANT OFFICER SEEMED TO DISCOVER THINGS AS THEY WERE FOR HE SAID JIM DUTTON BY JOVE THE OATH WAS NOT SO INNOCENT
WILL IT BE SWIFT ROUND-HAND OR A SLOW TWISTER OR A SHOOTER OR A LOB
A WICKED AND MERCILESS MAN I SAY REPEATED MISS LAKE
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE TROUBLED ABOUT MONEY
YOU SEE EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN YES MISS ANSWERED TAMAR WHOSE EYES WERE FIXED IN A SORT OF FASCINATION FULL ON THOSE OF HER MISTRESS
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE IN HUMAN SHAPE BUT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STAIRS THE GREEN EYES OF A LARGE CAT WERE SHINING
AND THEN JOS
BUT I THINK HE'S THE NASTIEST DOG I EVER MET
YOUR SORROWFUL AND ONLY SISTER RACHEL ON FINISHING THE LETTER STANLEY ROSE QUICKLY TO HIS FEET
IT WAS NO MITIGATION OF THE RUDENESS IN LAKE'S ESTIMATE THAT SIR HARRY WAS SO ENGROSSED AND ELATED AS TO SEEM HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF ANY EXISTENCE BUT MISS BRANDON'S AND HIS OWN
IS NOT IT SAD CERTAINLY
SIR DO YOU PRETEND TO BE A GENTLEMAN I RATHER THINK SO HE SAID WITH A QUIET SNEER
WILLIAM WYLDER WHICH HE WAS HAPPY TO SAY SEEMED TO HAVE CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT WITH MESSRS
THE BATTERED FELT HAT COVERED HIS FOREHEAD AND EYEBROWS AND LEFT IN FACT BUT A NARROW STREAK OF SEPARATION BETWEEN
IT WAS FERINE AND SPECTRAL AND SO TREMENDOUSLY VIOLENT THAT THE LONG ATTORNEY EXPECTING NOTHING OF THE SORT WAS THROWN OUT OF HIS BALANCE AGAINST THE CHIMNEYPIECE
NO HE COULD NOT
AND TO PLEASE OLD TAMAR YOU'LL JUST DRINK THIS THANK YOU TAMAR I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT THE TRUTH WAS SHE NEEDED IT
NEITHER SHOULD I I FANCY
AND I'LL DO AS YOU BID ME AND I HAVE DONE MASTER STANLEY HOWSOEVER IT TROUBLES MY MIND AND NOW OLD TAMAR'S WORDS SPOKE--THAT'S ALL
I AM AFRAID WE SHALL HAVE RAIN TO-MORROW LARKIN UTTERED A SHORT GROAN
I WONDER HE DID NOT DINE HERE TO-DAY
TELL MARTIN THE TILES I SAW IN AUGUST LAST WILL ANSWER FOR THE COW-HOUSE
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW KIND--HOW DISINTERESTEDLY GOOD HE HAS BEEN
AND HE FANCIED UNDER THE RED TAPE A LABEL TRACED IN THE NEATEST SCRIVENERY WITH A PENCIL OF LIGHT CONTAINING SUCH GRATIFYING TESTIMONIALS TO HIS DESERTS AS WELL DONE GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT THE SAINTS SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH AND SO FOLLOWING
SHE DOES NOT KNOW I'VE TOLD YOU ALL MYSELF STANLEY WENT TO THE LIBRARY AND DORCAS TO THE CONSERVATORY NEITHER VERY HAPPY EACH HAUNTED BY AN EVIL AUGURY AND A SENSE OF COMING DANGER
THE OTHER SIDE WILL SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY
SAY I AM VERY SORRY TO HEAR SHE IS SUFFERING
IN THE MEANTIME I RETURN THE MINIATURE WITH HER HAIR IN IT WHICH I CONSTANTLY WORE ABOUT ME SINCE I GOT IT
IT WAS KIND OF YOU AND THEIR EYES MET REGRETFULLY
I PROTEST I HAVE FORGOT IT AT HOME
LIKE THE REST OF HIS LETTERS IT WAS ODD BUT WRITTEN AS IT SEEMED IN BETTER SPIRITS
AND I DON'T SEE THAT IT CAN DO HIM ANY HARM REMEMBERING THAT HE HAS A SOUL TO BE SAVED OR THE OTHER THING EH LAUGHED WYLDER
ON HER HEAD WAS THE SAME CLOSE LINEN NIGHTCAP BORDERLESS AND SKULL-LIKE AND SHE LAID HER SHRIVELLED FRECKLED HAND UPON HIS ARM AND LOOKING WITH AN EARNEST AND FEARFUL GAZE IN HIS FACE SHE SAID IT HAS BEEN ON MY MIND THIS MANY A DAY TO SPEAK TO YOU MASTER STANLEY
FRAGRANT--WONDERFULLY FRAGRANT HE OBSERVED MEEKLY WITH A CONNOISSEUR'S SHAKE OF THE HEAD
GOD BLESS YOU DEAR
BUT SHE SAT IN THAT WAKING LETHARGY IN WHICH ARE SLUGGISH DREAMS OF HORROR AND NEITHER EYES NOR EARS FOR THAT WHICH IS BEFORE US
AND I THINK MY INCOME AND YOURS JOINED WOULD ENABLE US TO LIVE WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF GETTING INTO DEBT
THE LAYOVER OF GYLINGDEN IS SOMEHOW TWO OPAQUE FOR THEM I ALMOST THINK
THOUGH I COULD GIVE A TOLERABLE ACCOUNT OF MYSELF AFTER THE MANNER OF THE WHITE CAT IN THE STORY WHICH I THINK IS A PATTERN OF FRANKNESS AND MODEST DIGNITY
A PRODIGY
IS IT WITTY OR WISE OR LEARNED
IT IS MY LITTLE MAN
IT MUST HAVE LAIN THERE A CONSIDERABLE TIME FOR NOTWITHSTANDING THE ANTISEPTIC PROPERTIES OF THAT SORT OF SOIL MIXED WITH THE DECAYED BARK AND FIBRE OF TREES A PORTION OF THE FLESH OF THE HAND WAS DECOMPOSED AND THE NAKED BONE DISCLOSED
STILL HOPING HOWEVER THAT ALL MAY YET BE EXPLAINED I REMAIN MY DEAR WYLDER YOURS VERY TRULY CHELFORD LORD CHELFORD HAD NOT OPENED THE SUBJECT TO DORCAS
I DON'T ENVY THE MAN WHO IS SUPERIOR TO THE SOCIETY OF CHILDREN
AS SHE SAT HERE SHE HEARD THE CLANK OF A STEP APPROACHING MEASUREDLY FROM THE BRANDON SIDE
BUT WE SHALL BE QUITE BY OURSELVES SAY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
IT IS THE MOST TIRESOME THING YOU CAN CONCEIVE BUT YOU HAVE NOT SAID STANLEY THAT SHE DOES NOT SUSPECT THE TRUTH OF COURSE I SAY IT
I DON'T THINK THAT MR LARKIN HAD READ THE WANDERING JEW HE HAD NO GREAT TASTE FOR WORKS OF FANCY
GENERALLY IT IS ONE OF THE FEW SPECTACLES BEST SEEN ALONE
IT TOO DIES--SUCH A DEATH AS THE CHILDREN OF HEAVEN DIE HERE--ONLY TO GERMINATE AFRESH WITH CELESTIAL POWER AND BEAUTY MISS LAKE'S WAY LAY BY A FOOTPATH ACROSS A CORNER OF THE PARK TO REDMAN'S DELL
GO YOUR OWN WAY WHY CAN'T YOU
BUT LITTLE MAN BY THIS TIME WAS STRUGGLING TO GET DOWN AND GIVE CHASE TO A CROW GRUBBING NEAR THEM FOR DAINTIES WITH A MUDDY BEAK AND WAPSIE'S EYES FOLLOWED SMILING THE WILD VAGARIES OF HIS LITTLE FAIRY
I FANCY I WAS IN ONE OF THOSE MOODS WHICH UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES I SOMETIMES EXPERIENCE STILL--A SEMI-NARCOTIC EXCITEMENT SILENT BUT DELIGHTFUL
THERE IS THE SWORD A BURNISHED PIECE OF CUTLERY WEIGHING JUST SO MANY POUNDS
LET ME IN RADIE
WHOM SHE HAD RECEIVED WITH A COLDNESS IF NOT AVERSION SO MARKED THAT IF HE HAD A SPARK OF RACHEL'S SPIRIT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE APPROACHED HER MORE
HE'LL RETURN TO-MORROW
HE POPPED IN UNCEREMONIOUSLY
IT MUST BE SOMETHING VERY EXTRAORDINARY AND WELL WORTH INVESTIGATING--OF COURSE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE FAMILY--WHICH COULD HAVE EVOKED THE APPARITION WHICH HAD JUST CROSSED HIS WINDOW
A THIRD LADY AT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ORDINARY ROOM'S LENGTH AWAY HALF RECLINING ON AN OTTOMAN WAS NOW APPROACHED BY WYLDER WHO PRESENTED ME TO MISS BRANDON
I WALKED LIKE A SENTINEL UP AND DOWN MY CHAMBER PUFFING LEISURELY THE SOLEMN INCENSE AND TRYING TO THINK OF THE OPERA AND MY ESSAY ON PARADISE LOST AND OTHER PLEASANT SUBJECTS
WELL RADIE I KNOW YOU MEAN ME
THE SICK MAN LIKES THE SOUND OF HIS KIND DOCTOR'S STEP ON THE STAIRS
BUT THINK WHAT YOU MAY IT MUST BE DONE
THEY ARE ALL ASLEEP IN THE WHITE HOUSE I'LL BE WITH YOU IN FIVE MINUTES AND YOU SHALL HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF WHEN WE GET INTO DOLLINGTON STANLEY OPENED THE DOOR
THE REMAINDER WAS--THE VICAR WOULD CLEARLY UNDERSTAND--ONE OF THOSE RIDICULOUS PEDANTRIES OF LAW UPON WHICH OUR SYSTEM OF CROTCHETS AND FICTIONS INSISTED
HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST-OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGOT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
HE WAS IN AN INTENSE ELECTIONEERING EXCITEMENT
I THINK YOU MIGHT TRUST ME A LITTLE DORCAS--BUT THAT OF COURSE IS FOR YOU YOU ARE YOUR OWN MISTRESS NOW--BUT AT LEAST YOU MAY RECONSIDER THE QUESTION YOU PROPOSE DECIDING IN SO EXTRAORDINARY A WAY
BUT HIS GAME OF HIDE-AND-SEEK CANNOT GO ON FOR EVER
AND MARK WAS STILL MORE SORE AND ANGRY AND STRUTTED AWAY TO ANOTHER TABLE A LONG WAY OFF AND TOSSED OVER THE LEAVES OF A FOLIO OF WOUVERMAN'S WORKS AND DID NOT SEE ONE OF THE PLATES HE STARED AT SO SAVAGELY
SHE'S A GOOD LITTLE GIRL SHE QUITE BELIEVES HER MISTRESS IS UP STAIRS EH YES
THE BALD HEAD OF THE ATTORNEY AS HE LEANED OVER HIM AND INDICATED AN IMAGINARY LINE WITH HIS GOLD PENCIL-CASE WAS PRESENTED TOWARD MISS LAKE AS SHE ENTERED
SHE DID NOT LIKE WYLDER I THOUGHT ALTHOUGH SHE HAD BEEN THE INVENTOR AND CONSTRUCTOR OF THE FAMILY ALLIANCE OF WHICH HE WAS THE HERO
HOWEVER I MAY BE ONLY NERVOUS AND FOOLISH AND I THINK I'LL SPEAK TO LORD CHELFORD ABOUT IT THE ATTORNEY LOOKED DOWN AND TOOK HIS NETHER LIP GENTLY BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB
WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE LETTER HAD BEEN SENT BY MISTAKE TO BRANDON--TO CAPTAIN LAKE
SHE SMILED VERY BRIGHTLY NEXT MORNING
THE OLD VISCOUNTESS WAS FLUSHED SHE DID NOT ROUGE AND VERY ANGRY AND I THINK UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGH SHE AFFECTED HER USUAL SUPREMACY
WHY HIS OWN PAPER WAS BACKING THE MINISTERS
THE NOTICE WAS INDEED SO OUTRAGEOUS IN ITS SPIRIT AND SO INTOLERABLE IN ITS LANGUAGE THAT KNOWING SOMETHING OF STANLEY'S WILD AND TRUCULENT TEMPER HE BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THE EXPLOSION HE WAS ABOUT TO PROVOKE
THIS LETTER OF DUTTON'S TO BE SURE MAY TURN OUT TO BE ALL A LIE OR A BLUNDER
IT IS PLAIN RACHEL YOU DO NOT LIKE MY COMPANY TRUE DORCAS I DO NOT LIKE YOUR COMPANY
I WILL CALL EARLY TO-MORROW AND SEE MR WYLDER PARDON ME SAID THE ATTORNEY I HAVE TO ADDRESS MYSELF NEXT TO THE SECOND PORTION OF YOUR OFFER AS STATED TO ME BY MR W
LARKIN LIKE THE REST OF THE CONGREGATION WAS BY THIS TIME PRAYING HIS ELBOWS ON THE EDGE OF THE PEW HIS HANDS CLASPED HIS THUMBS UNDER HIS CHIN AND HIS LONG FACE AND PINK EYES RAISED HEAVENWARD WITH NOW AND THEN A GENTLE DOWNWARD DROPPING OF THE LATTER
IT WAS ALL YOU KNOW OLD LADY CHELFORD'S ARRANGEMENT
I SEE STANLEY YOU'VE HAD A SCENE WITH MARK WYLDER
ON THE LEFT THE ROAD IS OVERTOPPED BY MASSES OF NOBLE FOREST
AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL--I AM UPON MY WORD RACHEL ANSWERED WITH A HEAVY SIGH
AND HE SEED ME ON THE SHILLINGSWORTH PLATFORM AND I THINK HE TOOK ME FOR SOME ONE ELSE
NEITHER DO I--WHEN SHE PLEASES TO EXERT HER GOOD SENSE--BUT SHE CAN WHEN SHE PLEASES BOTH TALK AND ACT LIKE A FOOL AND PRAY WHAT DOES SHE WANT YOU TO DO STANLEY THE MEREST NONSENSE BUT WHAT IS IT I REALLY CAN HARDLY UNDERTAKE TO SAY I VERY WELL UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF AND I HAVE HALF-A-DOZEN LETTERS TO WRITE
ABOUT FOUR DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE DESPATCHES TO WHICH THE CONFERENCE OF CAPTAIN LAKE AND THE ATTORNEY REFERRED THERE CAME A LETTER FROM THE SAME PROLIFIC CORRESPONDENT DATED 20TH MARCH FROM GENOA WHICH ALTOGETHER PUZZLED MR LARKIN
DON'T YOU THINK I KNEW HIS HAND AND THE POST-MARK AND YOUR LOOK SAID QUITE PLAINLY HERE'S NEWS OF MY FRIEND STANLEY LAKE AND MARK WYLDER I HAD AN UNCLE IN THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND THEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE A DISTINGUISHED DIPLOMATIST IF HE HAD LIVED
M.P.--EH
AND YET IT MIGHT BE ALL TRUE ABOUT MARK'S SECRET MARRIAGE
I KNOW I WAS RIGHT
FOR ONE BOUT--I FANCY A GOOD DEAL LONGER THAN THE OTHERS--MY NAP WAS MUCH SOUNDER THAN BEFORE AND I OPENED MY EYES AT LAST WITH THE SHUDDER AND HALF HORROR THAT ACCOMPANY AN AWAKENING FROM A GENERAL CHILL--A DISMAL AND FRIGHTENED SENSATION
AND THE ARCHBISHOP WITH WINGS
AND NOW THAT IT WAS ALL DONE AND OVER TOLD HIM WHAT HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIM BEFORE THAT CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF THE PURCHASE HE HAD GOT A SPLENDID PRICE FOR IT THE GOOD MAN HAD ALSO HIS AGREEMENT FROM LAKE TO SELL FIVE OAKS
I WISH THEY HAD ANYONE ABLE TO ADVISE THEM
BUT LAKE WAS BUSY ABOUT THE DOLLINGTON CONSTITUENCY AND THE TOWN CLERK'S BLUFF FACE WAS SERIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL
TELL ME ALL YOU CAN MAKE OUT ABOUT HIM
BUT THERE WAS A RECLUSE AND UNEARTHLY CHARACTER IN THE FACE OF THE CRONE WHICH SATISFIED HIM THAT SHE WOULD NEVER THINK OF FENCING WITH SUCH WEAPONS WITH HIM
HAD HE SEEN IT AT ALL
SO I CEASED TO CHALLENGE THE UNEARTHLY INQUISITOR AND ALLOWED HIM AFTER A WHILE SERENELY ENOUGH TO PEEP AS I TURNED MY BACK OR TO WITHDRAW AGAIN AS I MADE MY REGULAR RIGHT-ABOUT FACE
AND MY ENTERING THE ROOM IS THE SIGNAL FOR SILENCE--A GUILTY SILENCE--FOR DEPARTURE AND FOR EQUIVOCATION
HIS MARE SHIED AT A DEAD BODY THAT'S THERE
YOUR POOR SOLDIER IS ALTOGETHER YOURS DORKIE AND HE KISSED HER CHEEK
IT IS IN MOTION ALREADY--D HIM--IT'S COMING AND YOU EXPECT ME TO DO EVERYTHING ALONE I REPEAT IT STANLEY SAID RACHEL WITH A FIERCE CYNICISM IN HER LOW TONES YOU DON'T WANT ADVICE
AND SECONDLY THAT HE IS HIMSELF DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE PURCHASE OF YOUR REVERSION
BUT IN THE FLESH OR OUT OF THE FLESH I SAW IT YOU HAVE HAD REVELATIONS SIR I'VE HEARD SAID STANLEY'S MOCKING VOICE
HE HAS BEEN THREE NIGHTS TOGETHER WITHOUT ONCE PUTTING OFF HIS CLOTHES--THINK OF THAT
IT WAS SELFISH--AND HATING SELFISHNESS--HE WOULD HAVE STRUCK THE SUN OUT OF THE SKY THAT MORNING WITH HIS WALKING-CANE IF HE COULD AND DRAPED THE WORLD IN BLACK
HIS FACE BLANCHED AS WHITE AS THE CLOTH
I WAS CURIOUS
THE CAPTAIN WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED INDEED AND BEGGED THEY WOULD GO INTO THE PARLOUR AND TAKE LUNCHEON
AND AS HE PURSUED HIS WAY HIS MIND GOT UPON THE ACCUSTOMED GROOVE AND AMUSED ITSELF WITH SPECULATIONS RESPECTING THE VAGARIES OF MARK WYLDER
WHERE IS THE MARVELLOUS TO FIND REFUGE IF NOT AMONG THE CHAMBERS THE INTRICACIES WHICH HAVE SEEN THE VICISSITUDES THE CRIMES AND THE DEATHS OF GENERATIONS OF SUCH MEN AS HAD OCCUPIED THESE
AND I SUPPOSE OUR GOOD VICAR WAS NOT EXEMPT FROM THEM ANY MORE THAN OTHER CHRISTIANS
AND THIS BLUNDER MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS CASE AS IN ANY OTHER THAT SUPPOSED THE SAME MACHINERY
AND IN A MINUTE MORE THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION RESUMED THEIR DRIVE
YOU WALK AS OVER STRATA OF STONE
I REMAIN C
HOW WAS IT THAT THIS MAN WITH THE YELLOW EYES SEEMED TO GLEAM FROM THEM AN INFLUENCE OF PAIN OR DISTURBANCE WHEREVER ALMOST HE LOOKED
SHE MADE ME PROMISE TO SEND FOR HER IF HE WAS WORSE--SHE LOVED HIM SO--EVERYONE LOVED HIM--THEY COULD NOT HELP--OH WILLIE
SHE WAS SITTING AND IN NO CALMER STATE
I?_--OH DEAR NO
SHE WILL SEE WHAT IS RIGHT AND DO IT
LARKIN OF THE LODGE GYLINGDEN 200_L STERLING ON MY ACCOUNT
I HEARD FROM GYBES LAST EVENING--WHAT A HAND THAT FELLOW WRITES--ONLY A DOZEN WORDS--"LOOK OUT FOR SQUALLS AND KEEP YOUR MEN IN HAND I'VE SENT FOR WEALDON
I VIEW IT NOW QUITE DIFFERENTLY
JERMYN IS WITH HIM BUT HE'LL BURN THE HOUSE OR MURDER SOME ONE YET
BUT HANG IT A FELLOW CAN'T HELP THINKING SOMETIMES THERE ARE OTHER THINGS BESIDES MONEY AND DORCAS IS NOT MY STYLE
CHAPTER LXIV
I AM COILING SUCH A WEB ROUND THEM AND MAKING IT FAST AS YOU MAY SEE A SPIDER FIRST TO THIS POINT AND THEN TO THE OTHER THAT I WON'T LEAVE MY PERSECUTORS ONE SOLITARY CHANCE OF ESCAPE
AND IN THIS HAPPY STATE AND VOLUNTEERING ALL MANNER OF COURTESIES OPENING AND SHUTTING WINDOWS LENDING HIS RAILWAY GUIDE AND HIS NEWSPAPERS WHENEVER HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY HE AT LENGTH REACHED THE GREAT LONDON TERMINUS AND WAS RATTLING OVER THE METROPOLITAN PAVEMENT WITH HIS HAND ON HIS DESPATCH-BOX TO HIS CHEAP HOTEL NEAR THE STRAND
IT COMES FROM THE GARDENS OF QUEEN'S AUDLEY
THE BRANDON ESTATE SHALL NOT BE DIMINISHED IN MY TIME WHY YOU PERVERSE IDIOT DON'T YOU PERCEIVE YOU IMPAIR THE ESTATE AS MUCH BY MORTGAGING AS BY SELLING WITH TEN TIMES THE ULTIMATE DANGER
CHAPTER LVII
LORD CHELFORD WAS ADVISED BY THE FRIEND WHOM HE CONSULTED THAT HE NEED NOT MAKE THOSE PAINFUL PARTICULARS PUBLIC AFFECTING ONLY A DEAD MAN AND LEADING TO NO RESULT
THERE WAS THE RUB
I WISH HE'D GIVE UP THAT TOWN-CLERKSHIP--IT CAN'T BE WORTH MUCH AND IT'S IN HIS WAY--I'D MAKE IT UP TO HIM SOMEHOW
WELL YOU KNOW WE LEARN BY EXPERIENCE MR WYLDER
THAT STUPENDOUS LIFE EVERLASTING NOW FIRST UNVEILED
TELL THEM TO LET HER LIE THERE WEALDON AND I HOWEVER SCRAMBLED DOWN THE BANK
OLD LADY CHELFORD STIFF AND RICH A VANDYKE DOWAGER WITH A GENERAL EFFECT OF DEEP LACE FUNEREAL VELVET AND PEARLS
WYLDER I'LL DRIVE SAID CAPTAIN LAKE
I ARRIVED YESTERDAY AND THEY TELL ME YOU STAY SO MUCH AT HOME THAT POSSIBLY YOU MIGHT NOT APPEAR IN THE UPPER WORLD FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS
I REACHED BRANDON RATHER LATE
CLINTON AND I WERE AT PIQUET AND WERE DISTURBED BY A PRECIOUS ROW THE OLD BOYS KICKED UP
DO YOU WANT TO WAKE YOUR PEOPLE UP OH
BUT I'LL COME OUT STRONG AS A VOTER_--THAT'S THE STUFF THEY LIKE--AT THE RIGHT SIDE OF COURSE AND THAT IS THE WAY TO MANAGE IT
SAFE SAFE AT HOME
BUT KEEP YOUR OFFENCES AGAINST GOD TO YOURSELF AND LET YOUR BATTLE WITH YOUR OWN HEART BE WAGED UNDER THE EYE OF HIM ALONE
THE VICAR WITH HIS LITTLE BOY FAIRY BY THE HAND USED TWICE AT LEAST IN THE WEEK TO MAKE SOMETIMES AN HOUR'S SOMETIMES ONLY HALF AN HOURS VISIT AT REDMAN'S FARM
SHE REVIEWED STANLEY IN HER MIND'S EYE
SIR WILLIAM WYLDER IN RUFF ROSETTES AND FULL DRESS OF JAMES I.'S FASHION ON HIS BACK DEFUNCT WITH CHILDREN IN CLOAKS KNEELING AT HEAD AND FOOT WAS HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE
WHEN HE ESCAPED MISS BRANDON WAS ENGAGED ONCE MORE--AND TO SIR HARRY BRACTON FOR A SECOND TIME
AND WHY NOT DEAR
GYLINGDEN HOWEVER WAS ONE OF THOSE PLACES WHICH IF IT KNOWS ANYTHING IS SURE TO FIND A WAY OF TELLING IT AND THE ATTORNEY WAS SOON SATISFIED THAT MARK'S SECRET VISIT HAD BEEN CONDUCTED WITH SUFFICIENT CAUTION TO BAFFLE THE EYES AND EARS OF THE GOOD FOLK OF THE TOWN
I'LL DO AS MUCH FOR YOU RADIE
YES IT IS TRUE--A TRUE ALLEGORY I MEAN TAMAR
SHE CAN'T REASON
AT ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK BUDDLE WAS CALLED UP AND SPIRITED AWAY TO BRANDON IN A DOG-CART
I THINK--I SUPPOSE YOU CAN HARDLY BE AWARE MA'AM THAT I AM HERE AS THE REV
IT WAS A LONG WALK
I CAN'T TAKE YOU--NO IT IS BUSINESS--STAY WITH MAMMA AND I'LL BE BACK AGAIN IN A FEW MINUTES SO SPITE OF FAIRY'S CLAMOURS AND THE REMONSTRANCES OF HIS FOND CLINGING LITTLE WIFE WITH A HURRIED KISS OR TWO AWAY HE WENT ALONE AT A VERY QUICK PACE THROUGH THE HIGH STREET OF GYLINGDEN AND WAS SOON IN THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THE SERIOUS GENTLEMAN ATTORNEY
SOMETIMES HIS SUSPICIONS TOOK A DIFFERENT TURN AND HE THOUGHT THAT LAKE MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE PERSECUTORS OF WHOM MARK SPOKE WITH SUCH MYSTERIOUS HATRED
BUT I CAN'T POSSIBLY PAY THEM DON'T YOU SEE
AND SO WITH YOUR LORDSHIP'S PERMISSION I'LL WITHDRAW LORD CHELFORD WALKED WITH HIM TO THE STEPS
WHEN I RETURNED TO BRANDON A FEW MORNINGS LATER CAPTAIN LAKE RECEIVED ME JOYFULLY AT HIS SOLITARY BREAKFAST
YOU SIT UP STAIRS CHIEFLY SHE NODDED SADLY
WILLIAM WYLDER GRADUALLY CAME TO OCCUPY A GOOD DEAL OF HIS TIME
BUT THE L300 WERE NOT YET IN HIS POCKET AND MARK HAD GONE AWAY
THANK YOU SAID HE TO THE MAID SUDDENLY RECOLLECTING HIMSELF WITH A SORT OF SMILE
AND HE SAT AFTERWARDS FOR NEARLY TEN MINUTES WITH LEAN OLD MRS MULLOCK IN HER LITTLE SHOP WHERE TOFFEY TOYS AND PENNY BOOKS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WERE SOLD TOGETHER WITH BASKETS TEA-CUPS STRAW-MATS AND OTHER ADULT WARE
THIS TIME IT WAS FROM MARSEILLES AND BORE DATE THE 27TH NOVEMBER
SHE WAS BETTER ACQUAINTED PERHAPS WITH HIS DEFECTS THAN HIS FASCINATIONS AND TOO FAMILIAR WITH BOTH TO APPRECIATE AT ALL THEIR EFFECT UPON A STRANGER
COME I SAY WHAT IS IT HE STOOPED AND LEANED HIS EAR TO TAMAR
YOU MUST NOT LOOK SO INCREDULOUS
PRECISELY L62 7_S
I DON'T LIKE HIM
CIGARS LIKE OTHER PLEASURES ARE TRANSITORY
THE FOG MAKES ONE COUGH A LITTLE THIS EVENING LARKIN'S ANSWER THANKS AND ENQUIRIES CAME GRAVELY IN RETURN
HE WON'T EAT AND LOOKS PALE BUT HE SLEPT VERY WELL MY DARLING MAN
HE WAS IN SUCH AN ODD STATE HE COULD NOT QUITE TRUST HIMSELF
WHY I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NO INTENTION OF TRYING TO DEFEAT YOUR OWN ACT AND THAT IS ALL THE LETTER WOULD GO TO
I'LL WALK DOWN AND SEE HER AND LAKE YAWNED AT THE WINDOW AND THEN TOOK HIS HAT AND STICK AND SAUNTERED TOWARD GYLINGDEN
HE READ IT THROUGH
THE VICAR'S REVERSION IN THAT CASE WAS EVERYTHING
THE CONVENTIONAL COUNTENANCE TOO WAS WANTING
AND IS NOT HE VULGAR TOO BUT DORCAS WAS NOT DEMONSTRATIVE
BUT HIS ORGIES WHEN OFF DUTY WERE SUCH AS TO CAUSE THE GOOD ATTORNEY WHEN COMPLAINTS REACHED HIM TO SHAKE HIS HEAD AND SIGH PROFOUNDLY AND SOMETIMES TO LIFT UP HIS MILD EYES AND LONG HANDS
THE PONY CARRIAGE SO SOON AS DAYLIGHT CAME I MADE A SWIFT COLD WATER TOILET AND GOT OUT INTO THE OPEN AIR WITH A SOLEMN RESOLUTION TO SEE THE HATED INTERIOR OF THAT BED-ROOM NO MORE
YOU MUST REFLECT MY DEAR LAKE HOW VERY SEVERE ARE THE INJURIES YOU HAVE SUSTAINED
IT CAN'T BE HELPED AND I SAY YOU MUST
BRING ALL YOUR PAPERS AND I'LL GET AT THE ROOT OF THE BUSINESS AND SEE IF POSSIBLE IN EACH PARTICULAR CASE WHAT LINE IS BEST TO BE ADOPTED HOW CAN I THANK YOU MY DEAR SIR CRIED GENTLE WILLIAM WYLDER HIS COUNTENANCE ACTUALLY BEAMING WITH DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE--A BRIGHTER LOOK THAN IT HAD WORN FOR MANY WEEKS
HE WAS REFRESHED
WHAT WILD BEASTS THEY ARE
THAT'S ALL
THAT'S ALL
POOR LADY CHELFORD WHO LOVED TO GIVE THE INGENIOUS YOUNGSTERS OF BOTH SEXES WHEN OCCASION INVITED A PIECE OF HER MIND WAS HERE--IN THE CASE OF THIS VULGAR AND MOST PROVOKING DELINQUENT--ABSOLUTELY TONGUE-TIED
I'VE SAID PLAINLY AND I'M READY TO SWEAR IT
IF MY BROTHER DARED SAY THAT IN MY PRESENCE I WOULD MAKE HIM CONFESS BEFORE YOU THAT HE KNOWS IT CANNOT BE
THERE IS SOMETHING AWFUL ALWAYS IN THE SPECTACLE OF SUCH A SICK-BED AS THAT BESIDE WHICH RACHEL HAD JUST STOOD
SO I GLANCED AT HER AND MISS BRANDON DIVINED IT SEEMED WHAT WAS PASSING IN MY MIND FOR SHE SAID THAT IS MY COUSIN MISS LAKE AND I THINK HER VERY BEAUTIFUL--DON'T YOU YES SHE CERTAINLY IS VERY HANDSOME AND I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HER ANIMATION AND SPIRIT BUT REMEMBERED JUST IN TIME THAT THAT LINE OF EULOGY WOULD HARDLY HAVE INVOLVED A COMPLIMENT TO MISS BRANDON
SOME PLEASANT ENOUGH AS HE MEASURED PLEASURE OTHERS TROUBLESOME
HER LOOKS ALARMED THE NURSE WHO WITH RACHEL'S HELP PERSUADED HER TO LEAVE THE ROOM
IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY SCENERY COME IN STANLEY AND ADMIRE MY DECORATIONS
IT IS THE VERY TEMPLE OF BLUE-DEVILRY AND I ASSURE YOU IF I LIVED AS YOU DO I'D CUT MY THROAT BEFORE A MONTH--YOU MUSTN'T
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO UP STAIRS WITH YOU MISS COME AND SO UP STAIRS THEY WENT
AND BY THE TIME I SEE HER NEXT HER OLD FANCY POSSESSES HER
IT IS MONSTROUS HIS BEING SOLICITOR FOR BOTH
NEITHER WAS THERE ANY FLURRY IN HER MANNER--HER BONY ARM AND DISCOLOURED HAND ONCE HER FINGERS LAY UPON HIS SLEEVE DID NOT MOVE--ONLY SHE LOOKED VERY EARNESTLY IN HIS FACE AS SHE SPOKE
THEY THINK HE WANTS TO GET THEM INTO A FIX--HEY
NO ONE'S TO BLAME BUT WYLDER HIMSELF
AND AN IRREGULAR SCREEN OF TIMBER AND UNDERWOOD DIVIDED THE COMMON OF GYLINGDEN IN SYLVAN FASHION FROM THE MOOR
BUT DORCAS I AM AFRAID THE VERY SAME THOUGHT HAS BEEN IN HIS MIND I HOPE NOT RADIE AND DORCAS SIGHED DEEPLY
ONLY YOU MAY SAY IF ANYONE PRESSES THAT I AM THINKING OF HIRING YOU TO ATTEND ON A GENTLEMAN WHOSE NAME YOU DON'T YET KNOW WHO'S GOING TO TRAVEL
THERE WAS NOT ONE OF US WHO LOOKED AT HIM THAT DID NOT FEEL CONVINCED THAT HE WAS MORTALLY HURT
BUT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONSIDERED I CANNOT AVOID CONCLUDING AS YOU DO THAT THERE MUST BE SOME VERY SERIOUS REASON FOR IT
I'VE ONLY ONE WORD
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD MADE ANY SUCH CONFESSION
BUT I FEAR I DO SEE A DIFFICULTY--IN FACT SEVERAL DIFFICULTIES
HE PERCEIVED WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DID NOT THAT MISS BRANDON'S EYE ONCE ON THAT EVENING RESTED FOR A MOMENT ON CAPTAIN LAKE WITH A PECULIAR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST
WYLDER'S CROTCHETS WERE CHIEFLY MARE'S NESTS WE HAD READ THE DRAFT OF THE SETTLEMENT PREPARATORY TO ITS BEING SENT TO SENIOR COUNSEL TO BE APPROVED
A FAINT PERFUME OF THE MILDEST CHEROOT DECLARED HOW THEY HAD BEEN EMPLOYED
THE MOST COMPANIONABLE MEN ARE NOT ALWAYS THE GREATEST INTELLECTS
IT WON'T DO PEDDLING AND TINKERING IN SUCH A CASE
HA HA
PERHAPS HIS PERSONNEL PREJUDICED ME--THOUGH I COULD NOT QUITE SAY WHY
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SITTING HERE YOU FANCY YOURSELF EXAMINING SOME VAGRANT OR POACHER AT GYLINGDEN SESSIONS
AND WHY ASKED DORCAS
THE DEVIL AND HIS WIFE I CALL THEM
YOU ARE RESTED SHE SAID
SOMETHING IN THE ELBOW
PROPHESYING ANSWERED THE PHANTOM
OR DORCAS--OR HAD LAKE THE DIABOLICAL SNEAK INTERPOSED WITH HIS LONG PURSE AND A PLAUSIBLE HYPOCRISY OF KINDNESS TO SPOIL LARKIN'S PLANS
THE NURSE'S ARM ROUND HIS THIN SHOULDERS
I THOUGHT OF WHAT MY VISION SAID OF THE BLOOD UPON MY FOREHEAD AND BY JOVE
HE INTENDED TO SPEAK BUT HIS VOICE CAUGHT
WAS EVER SO PLEASANT A DOCTOR
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF STOPPING ME HERE BECAUSE MASTER STANLEY SOMETHING TOLD ME TIS THE BEST PLACE
I ONLY KNOW HE SEEMS TO BE A BETTER MARKSMAN THAN YOUR POOR BROTHER RACHEL LOOKED AT HER WITH SOMETHING OF HAUGHTY AND SURPRISED DISPLEASURE BUT SAID NOTHING
WILLIAM WYLDER YOU SHAN'T BUT MY DEAR MISS LAKE WE HAVE CONSIDERED EVERYTHING AND MR LARKIN AND I AGREE THAT MY CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SUCH AS TO MAKE IT INEVITABLE REALLY THIS IS CHILD'S PLAY
NOW HERE'S A THING WORTH YOUR LOOKING AT
AND HE LOITERED SILENTLY AND STOOD WITH THE CURTAIN IN HIS GLOVED HAND LOOKING UPON THE COLD COVERLET AS IF RACHEL LAY DEAD THERE
SHALL I WRITE IT ALL IN A BOOK AND GIVE IT YOU
SHE IS DORCAS BRANDON
HONEST MAJOR JACKSON WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
WILL YOU HAVE A CIGAR NO WELL I BELIEVE TWO'S ENOUGH FOR ME AND HE LOOKED UP AT THE STARS
OLD TAMAR WILL SOON BE IN HER COFFIN AND THIS NIGHT FAR IN THE PAST LIKE MANY ANOTHER AND TWILL BE EVERYTHING TO YOU ONE DAY FOR WEAL OR WOE TO HEARKEN TO HER WORDS NOW MASTER STANLEY WHY TAMAR HAVEN'T I TOLD YOU I'M READY TO LISTEN TO YOU
BUT AT AN ORDINARY SYMPOSIUM WHEN THE GARRULOUS AND DIFFIDENT MAKE MERRY TOGETHER AND PEOPLE BREAK INTO TWOS OR THREES AND TALK ACROSS THE TABLE OR INTO THEIR NEIGHBOURS EARS AND ALL TOGETHER THE NOISE IS NOT ONLY EXHILARATING AND PECULIAR BUT SOMETIMES PERFECTLY UNACCOUNTABLE
LAKE SAT WITH ME CHATTING RATHER CLEVERLY NOT PLEASANTLY
THINKING ABOUT YOU--AND I HAVE JUST HEARD FROM AN OLD HUMBLE FRIEND WHO WANTS HIGH INTEREST AND OF COURSE IS CONTENT TO TAKE SECURITY SOMEWHAT PERSONAL IN ITS NATURE
AFTER THIS MR LARKIN'S RUMINATIONS DARKENED AND GREW PERHAPS LESS DISTINCT
NOTHWITHSTANDING ALL WHICH THERE REMAINED IN HIS MIND AN IMAGE OF MARK WYLDER IN THE STRAW AND DARKNESS OF A SOLITARY CONTINENTAL MAD-HOUSE--SQUALID NEGLECTED AND BECOMING GRADUALLY THAT WHICH HE WAS SAID TO BE
CHELFORD MADE SUCH A POINT OF IT
WOULD IT WERE SO--WOULD TO HEAVEN IT WERE SO SUPPOSE RACHEL THAT I HAD BEEN DECEIVING YOU--PERHAPS DECEIVING MYSELF--TIME WILL SHOW THERE WAS A WILD SMILE ON BEAUTIFUL DORCAS'S FACE AS SHE SAID THIS WHICH FADED SOON INTO THE PROUD SERENITY THAT WAS ITS USUAL CHARACTER
SHE DID NOT LIKE HIS MOODS OR LOOKS AFTER THOSE VISITS OF WHICH HE THOUGHT SHE KNEW NOTHING
SHE SAW HIS YELLOW EYES FIXED UPON HER FEATURES AND HIS FACE WEARING AN ODD EXPRESSION--WAS IT INTEREST OR TENDERNESS OR ONLY SCRUTINY
THEY WERE THE DESULTORY STRIDES OF A STROLLER LOUNGING OUT AN HOUR'S WATCH
THE GREAT LONDON DOCTOR SIR FRANCIS SEDDLEY WILL BE WITH YOU EARLY IN THE MORNING AND CHELFORD HAS GREAT CONFIDENCE IN HIM
IT IS NOT A BAD SIGN BLEEDING SO FREELY BUT HE LOOKS DEVILISH SHAKY YOU SEE
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING NOT ALTOGETHER JOYOUS IN JOS
HE WAS GOING INTO THIS AS INTO A GREAT SPECULATIVE CASE IN WHICH HE HAD A HEAVY STAKE WITH ALL HIS ACTIVITY CRAFT AND UNSCRUPULOUSNESS
HE HAD BROUGHT THE MONEY WHICH HE KNEW WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE AT SUCH A MOMENT AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE TO SIGN AND SEAL FORTHWITH TO WHICH THE CAPTAIN A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY AGREED
AND I MIGHT BE LEFT IN THE LURCH IT IS A BETTER WAY AT ALL EVENTS MARK THAN WYLDER VERSUS TRUSTEES OF BRANDON MINOR SAID I
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRESENT WAS PAST
IN THE DUTCH ROOM AFTER TEA I SUPPOSE SAID THE ATTORNEY
YOU ARE BETTER DARLING
YOU ARE BETTER DARLING
YOU ARE BETTER DARLING
AND WAS IT NOT SPECULATIVE AND WAS IT NOT POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD LOSE ALL THAT MONEY AND WAS IT NOT ON THE WHOLE THE WISEST THING THAT THE VICAR UNDER HIS DIFFICULTIES COULD HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO DO
WHAT CLUMSY GRANDEUR
WHAT A FELLOW THAT IS
CAPTAIN LAKE HAD MANY THINGS TO THINK OF
SEE NOW MISS RADIE DEAR
AND THE OLD WOMAN ASSISTED HER TO UNDRESS AND SO SHE LAY DOWN WITH A SIGH IN HER BED
BUT HE ENDED BY SHOOTING HIMSELF THROUGH THE HEAD IN HIS BED-ROOM AND THAT WAS NOT THE WORST THING EVER HE DID AND WYLDER LAUGHED AGAIN AND BEGAN TO WHISTLE VERY LOW--NOT I FANCY FOR WANT OF THOUGHT BUT AS A SORT OF ACCOMPANIMENT THERETO FOR HE SUDDENLY SAID AND WHERE IS HE STAYING WHO?--LAKE YES I DON'T KNOW
WHEN THE SERVICE WAS OVER CAPTAIN LAKE WENT ACROSS TO MR SPARKS AND ASKED HIM TO COME TO BRANDON TO LUNCH
AND YOU COULD FROM ITS DARKENED WINDOW SEE ITS RED BEAMS STILL TINTING THE HIGH GROUNDS OF WILLERSTON VISIBLE THROUGH THE STEMS OF THE OLD TREES THAT WERE MASSED IN THE NEAR FOREGROUND
AND IN THE WAITING-ROOM HE MADE SOME EQUALLY BUSINESS-LIKE MEMORANDA BEING CERTAIN CHIPS AND SPLINTERS STRUCK OFF THE CLUMSY TALK OF THESE OFFICIALS AND LAID UP IN THE LAWYER'S LITTLE PRIVATE MUSEUM FOR FUTURE ILLUSTRATION AND ANALYSIS
MY GOOD CLIENT MR MARK WYLDER
HA HA HA AND WYLDER CHUCKLED ANGRILY AND THE SMALL CHANGE IN HIS POCKET TINKLED FIERCELY AS HIS EYE GLANCED ON THE GRACEFUL CAPTAIN WHO WAS ENTERTAINING THE LADIES NO DOUBT VERY AGREEABLY IN THE DISTANCE
IS IT NIGHT YET DON'T DESPAIR STANLEY DEAR
AND LET HIM PUT THEM DOWN AT ONCE
BUT COME WHAT MIGHT SHE WOULD NOT ABANDON THE VICAR AND HIS LITTLE BOY AND GOOD DOLLY TO THE ARTS OF THAT ABOMINABLE MAGICIAN
BUT THEY CERTAINLY DID TAKE RATHER WHAT I WOULD CALL A SHORT TURN WITH US ON THE OCCASION TO WHICH I REFER
CHAPTER XLVIII
AND HE SET HIS TWO NEWSPAPERS HIS SHILLING BOOK AND OTHER TRIUMPHS OF CHEAP LITERATURE IN SUNDRY SHAPES IN THE VACANT SEAT AT HIS LEFT HAND AND MADE EVERYTHING HANDSOME ABOUT HIM
SHOULD IT PROVE ADVERSE YOU ARE TO EXPECT AN IMMEDIATE DISSOLUTION
CAPTAIN LAKE VISITS HIS SISTER'S SICK BED XXII.--IN WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE MEETS A FRIEND NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE XXIII.--HOW RACHEL SLEPT THAT NIGHT IN REDMAN'S FARM XXIV.--DORCAS BRANDON PAYS RACHEL A VISIT XXV.--CAPTAIN LAKE LOOKS IN AT NIGHTFALL XXVI.--CAPTAIN LAKE FOLLOWS TO LONDON XXVII.--LAWYER LARKIN'S MIND BEGINS TO WORK XXVIII.--MARK WYLDER'S SUBMISSION XXIX.--HOW MARK WYLDER'S DISAPPEARANCE AFFECTED HIS FRIENDS XXX.--IN BRANDON PARK XXXI.--IN REDMAN'S DELL XXXII.--MR
LAKE UNDER THE LAWYER'S SMALL VIGILANT EYES QUIETLY READ MARK WYLDER'S AWFUL THREATENINGS THROUGH TWICE OVER AND LARKIN WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER THERE WAS ANY CHANGE OF COUNTENANCE TO SPEAK OF AS HE DID SO
AND WHO CAN RESIST A DOCTOR'S JOKES WHEN THEY GARNISH SUCH TIDINGS AS HE WAS TELLING
WELL THEN AS IT SEEMS I MUST HEAR IT PRAY SPEAK AT ONCE STANDING WHERE WE ARE AND QUICKLY FOR THE SUN WILL SOON GO DOWN AND ONE STEP MORE I WILL NOT WALK WITH YOU WELL RADIE YOU ARE PLEASED TO BE WHIMSICAL
BUT HE HAD NOT HIS TIN BOXES THERE
I WISH THE MORNING PAPERS WERE COME
HE NEVER TELLS ME HIS PLANS THOUGH HE MUST KNOW--HE DOES KNOW--I LOVE HIM
SO HE GRINNED FACETIOUSLY AS HE PUT THE COIN IN HIS BREECHES POCKET AND THANKED HIM
AT THE END OF THAT TIME A FOREIGN LETTER CAME FOR HIM TO THE LODGE
LAKE SO TO SPEAK STOOD AT HIS WICKET AND THAT ACCOMPLISHED BOWLER FORTUNE BALL IN HAND AT THE OTHER END
GOOD-NIGHT WHEN THE LIGHT WHEELS OF THE DOG-CART GRITTED ON THE MILL-ROAD BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN GATE OF REDMAN'S FARM THE TALL SLENDER FIGURE OF RACHEL LAKE WAS DIMLY VISIBLE STANDING CLOAKED AND WAITING BY IT
THE ADDRESS TO WHICH HIS LETTERS WERE FORWARDED WAS THE BRANDON ARMS GYLINGDEN SO CAPTAIN LAKE INFORMED THAT FUNCTIONARY THAT HIS FRIEND HAD COME UP TO TOWN AND ASKED HIM AGAIN WHETHER HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT HE HAD NOT CALLED THERE OR SENT FOR HIS LETTERS.--NO
HE'S ILL-TEMPERED
THERE ARE SOME CHEERFUL LITTLE COTTAGES NEAR THE GREEN IN GYLINGDEN AND I VENTURE TO THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY GLOOMIEST AND MOST UNCOMFORTABLE PLACES YOU COULD HAVE SELECTED TO LIVE IN RACHEL LOOKED DREARILY TOWARD THE WINDOW AND SIGHED--IT WAS ALMOST A GROAN
WYLDER PLAINLY WROTE IN GREAT HASTE AND MERELY SAID I SHALL HAVE TO WAIT A DAY OR TWO LONGER THAN I YESTERDAY THOUGHT TO MEET A FELLOW FROM WHOM I AM TO RECEIVE SOMETHING OF IMPORTANCE RATHER AS I THINK TO ME
WEALDON'S TWO LITTLE VISITS EXPLAINED PERFECTLY THE ACTIVE URBANITIES OF CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE
YES DEAR BETTER--VERY WELL'--ANSWERED RACHEL LOOKING UP BUT WITHOUT AN ANSWERING GLANCE AT HER COUSIN
STANLEY LOOKED AS IF HE DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND AND THERE WAS A LITTLE SILENCE
THIS IS FROM GYBES--LET US SEE
HE WAS PALE
SERENE ENOUGH IN ATTITUDE BUT THE TERRIBLY WILD LOOK WAS UNCHANGED
MARK WYLDER'S HAND
THEREFORE UPON PRINCIPLE HE WAS NOT AVERSE FROM THAT DIREST OF BORES RAILWAY CONVERSATION
BURLINGTON SMITH AND CO
HE DID NOT COME A MINUTE TOO SOON OR TOO LATE BUT PRECISELY AT THE MOMENT WHICH ENABLED HIM WITHOUT FUSS AND WITHOUT A TIRESOME WAIT TO PROCEED TO THE DETAILS OF TICKET LUGGAGE SELECTION OF PLACE AND ULTIMATE ASCENSION THERETO
YOU'LL SEE IT IN A LITTLE WHILE
AND ALONE ON THE TERRACE LOOKING OVER THE STONE BALUSTRADE--OVER THE RICH AND SOMBRE LANDSCAPE DIM AND VAPOROUS IN THE TWILIGHT--SHE STILL SAW THE PALE FACE OF RACHEL--PALER THAN SHE LIKED TO SEE IT
STANLEY STANLEY!--BROTHER BROTHER OH BROTHER THERE WAS THE UNCHANGED FACE GAPING ITS AWFUL FAREWELL OF EARTH
WHAT STAY I FORGOT TO ASK DO YOU MAKE IN TOWN ONLY A DAY OR TWO YOU'LL NOT WAIT FOR THE DIVISION ON TRAWLER'S MOTION OH DEAR NO
ONE KNOWS THINGS SOMETIMES
SHE RUNS AWAY WITH THINGS
I KNEW HE WAS AT DONNYSTON BUT HE DID NOT MENTION HE HAD SEEN YOU THERE
HE WAS A GOOD DEAL SURPRISED THEN WHEN MISS LAKE SAID AND WITH QUITE A CHEERFUL COUNTENANCE AND VERY QUICKLY BUT SO THAT HER WORDS STUNG HIS EAR LIKE THE PRICK OF A BODKIN
BURLINGTON AND SMITH
QUITE SO REPEATED LAKE SOFTLY TAKING THE THIN NEATLY FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER WHICH LARKIN WITH A SAD INCLINATION OF HIS BODY HANDED TO HIM
HE SEEMED TO DO IT WITHOUT A PURPOSE--BY INSTINCT OR ON PRINCIPLE--AND WOULD CONTRADICT HIMSELF SOLEMNLY TWICE OR THRICE IN A WEEK WITHOUT SEEMING TO PERCEIVE IT
YOU DO LOOK VERY ILL
LARKIN WAS I AM SORRY TO SAY IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE OFFENSIVE--'FLAGITIOUS FRAUDULENT AND KINDRED EPITHETS WERE LAUNCHED AGAINST THAT TALL BALD HEAD IN A STORM THAT DARKENED THE AIR AND OBLITERATED THE HALO THAT USUALLY ENCIRCLED IT
HOW VERY BEAUTIFUL THAT CLUMP OF BIRCH TREES IS NEAR THE EDGE OF THE SLOPE THERE
ALL THESE AND FIFTY MINOR MEASURES WERE ORDERED BY THE FERTILE WEALDON IN A MINUTE AND SUITABLE MESSENGERS ON THE WING TO SEE AFTER THEM
BUT THERE IT REMAINED LIKE THE PICTURE OF A CAMERA OBSCURA INTO WHICH A MOMENTARY LIGHT HAS BEEN ADMITTED UNSEEN FOR A SECOND BUT THE IMAGES RETURN WITH THE DARKNESS AND GROUP THEMSELVES IN THEIR OLD COLOURS AND PLACES AGAIN
AS FOR ME I WAS PUZZLED
BUT THOUGH WE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FIND HIM HE KNOWS VERY WELL WHERE TO FIND US--AND AS YOU ARE AWARE WE HEAR FROM HIM CONSTANTLY--AND NO DOUBT HE RECOLLECTS HIS PROMISE AND WILL TRANSMIT THE NECESSARY DIRECTIONS ALL IN GOOD TIME I EARNESTLY HOPE HE MAY AND THE POOR CLERIC LIFTED UP HIS EYES UNCONSCIOUSLY AND THREW HIS HOPE INTO THE FORM OF A PRAYER
I LIGHTED ON HIM IN THE VILLAGE
AND I THINK HE ADDED WITH AN OATH HAVING FIRST TAKEN TWO PUFFS AT HIS CIGAR IF I HAD SEEN HER FIRST I'D HAVE THOUGHT TWICE BEFORE I'D HAVE GOT MYSELF INTO THIS BUSINESS I ONLY SMILED AND SHOOK MY HEAD
DUTTON MIGHT ARRIVE AT ANY MOMENT
AND AFTERWARDS SHOT HIS COACHMAN DEAD UPON THE BOX THROUGH HIS COACH-WINDOW AND FINALLY DIED IN VIENNA WHITHER HE HAD ABSCONDED OF A PIKE-THRUST RECEIVED FROM A SENTRY IN A BRAWL
WHAT SALOON WAS EVER SO CHEERY AS THIS OR FLASHED ALL OVER IN SO SMALL A LIGHT SO SPLENDIDLY OR YIELDED SUCH IMMORTAL NECTAR FROM CHASED TEAPOT AND URN AS THIS BREWED IN BROWN CROCKERY FROM THE ROARING KETTLE
I THINK HE KNEW OLD MR BEAUCHAMP
BUT MY DEAR CAPTAIN LAKE LET US BE PLAIN
BUT DROWNING MEN WILL GRASP WE KNOW AT STRAWS
HE IS SUCH A LIAR
THE POWER TO BRING HIS FRIENDS--THOSE WHOM HE LIKED OR WHO AMUSED HIM--ABOUT HIM AND TO INDULGE LUXURIOUSLY EVERY REASONABLE FANCY WILLING TO FORSAKE ALL AND FOLLOW THE BECK OF THAT PHANTOM
THE VICAR ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ALL THAT WE KNOW
MY MOTIVES ARE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO YOU I KNOW AND YOU THINK ME OBSTINATE AND STUPID
YOU KNOW HER I BELIEVE
ONLY TRY ME SHE FANCIED SHE SAW IN DOLLY'S FACE UNDER ALL HER GRATITUDE SOME PERPLEXITY AND HESITATION AND FEARED TO ACCEPT A DECISION THEN
WHEN THE SERVICE WAS OVER THE NEIGHBOURLY LITTLE CONGREGATION WITH A SPRINKLING OF VISITORS TO GYLINGDEN FOR SAKE OF ITS HEALING WATERS BROKE UP AND LOITERED IN THE VICINITY OF THE PORCH TO REMARK ON THE SERMON OR THE WEATHER AND ASK ONE ANOTHER HOW THEY DID AND TO SEE THE BRANDON FAMILY ENTER THEIR CARRIAGE AND THE TALL POWDERED FOOTMAN SHUT THE DOOR UPON THEM AND MOUNT BEHIND AND MOVE OFF AT A BRILLIANT PACE AND WITH A GLORIOUS CLANGOUR AND WHIRL OF DUST
SHE WAS QUICKLY BETTER
SO REASONED THE GOOD ATTORNEY AS WITH A LANGUID SMILE AND A SIGH OF CONTENT HIS LONG HAND LAID ACROSS THE COVER OF THE DESPATCH-BOX BY HIS SIDE HE LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE PLATE-GLASS WINDOW UPON THE SUNNY FIELDS AND HEDGEROWS THAT GLIDED BY HIM AND FELT THE BLESSED ASSURANCE LOOK WHATSOEVER HE DOETH IT SHALL PROSPER MINGLING IN THE HUM OF SURROUNDING NATURE
IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR'S TIME HOWEVER I HAD QUITE WORKED OFF THE EFFECT OF THIS NIGHT-MARE AND REASONED MYSELF INTO THE NATURAL SOLUTION THAT THE CREATURE HAD GOT ON MY BED AND LAY AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY WILL UPON MY THROAT AND SO ALL THE REST HAD FOLLOWED
OUR SHIP WAS AT MALTA WHEN I GOT THE LETTER
TO MY EYE THERE IS NO SCENERY SO SWEET AS THIS AT LEAST TO BREAKFAST BY
THE CONNUBIAL CAPABILITIES OF GYLINGDEN ARE POSITIVELY WRETCHED
LARKIN TOLD ME THIS--AND I TOOK AN OPINION--AND FOUND IT IS SO
DO YOU GET FORWARD AT ONCE
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME
AND SO ABSURD AS IF HE COULD SUCCEED IN DECEIVING ANYONE UPON THE SUBJECT SO I READ THE PARAGRAPH OVER AGAIN AND LAID DOWN THE PAPER SIMPLY SAYING WELL CERTAINLY THAT IS DISGUSTING I HAD HEARD OF HIS DUEL
MY OLD HEAD'S A POOR ONE TO REMEMBER WHIMPERED WHITE TAMAR
HE HAD BEEN VEHEMENTLY ENAMOURED OF THE HEIRESS OF BRANDON A YEAR AGO AND MORE
YOU MUST PROMISE ME NOT TO BE FRIGHTENED AT WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU SAID LAKE
AT THE CLUB I SAW IT IN THE MORNING POST AND AN HOUR AFTER OLD JOE GABLOSS THAT PROSY ARGUS WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING RECOUNTED THE DETAILS WITH PATIENT PRECISION AND IN LEGAL PHRASE PUT IN LETTERS FROM TWO OR THREE COUNTRY HOUSES PROVING HIS STATEMENT
LOVE IS NOT BLIND WITH ME BUT QUITE INSANE
SOME DAY I MAY BE--I AM SICK AND TERRIFIED THEY HAD SAT DOWN BY THIS TIME SIDE BY SIDE ON THE CRISP BANK
THEREFORE ARRANGEMENTS WERE CAREFULLY ADJUSTED TO DETAIN THAT IMPORTANT PERSON IN THE EVENT OF HIS ARRIVING
NOT FOR TWO MONTHS
EVERYTHING WAS AS I HAD LEFT IT EXCEPT THE DOOR WHICH WAS THE LEAST BIT OPEN
POOR DEAR DEVIL!--HOW HE DID JUMP AT THE CONDITIONS;--AND PROVIDED THEY WERE EACH AND ALL STRICTLY OBSERVED IT WAS INTIMATED THAT THE OCCURRENCE SHOULD BE KEPT SECRET
HOW DID IT HAPPEN--OH HOW?--YOU SUCH A SCHOLAR SO CLEVER SO HANDSOME MY BEAUTIFUL WILLIE--HOW DID YOU EVER LOOK DOWN ON POOR WRETCHED ME I THINK IT WILL BE FINE WILLIE AND MISS LAKE WILL EXPECT YOU AT REDMAN'S FARM
I WAS COMIN DOWN TO SEE THE CAPTAIN AT BRANDON--AND SEED HIM THE SAME NIGHT WHY HAVE YOU COME HERE ASKED THE CORONER
VACANT PEEVISH WITH AN UNMEANING PASSION FOR CORRUPTION AND INTRIGUE AND THE SORT OF EGOTISM WHICH CRAVES DISTINCTION
IT WAS THE ACCIDENTAL DISCLOSURE OF THE BLOOD IN WHICH HIS SHIRT SLEEVE WAS SOAKED THAT FIRST OPENED RACHEL'S EYES TO THE FRIGHTFUL TRUTH
THIS IS YOUR D--D WORK
TAMAR WILL TELL YOU WHO HAS CALLED--HARDLY ANYONE--I SAW THEM MYSELF EVERY DAY AT BRANDON AND TOLD THEM YOU WERE ILL
SHE STOOD MEDITATING FOR A MINUTE
YES I DO REALLY THINK YOU HAD BEGUN TO LIKE LORD CHELFORD--ONLY BEGUN THE LEAST LITTLE INSIDIOUS BIT
WHERE'S THE STATION-MASTER ALL THIS TIME HE KEPT STARING AFTER THE FAINT PULSATIONS ON THE AIR THAT INDICATED THE FLIGHT OF THE ENGINE
WHEN DO YOU MEAN TO PAY DAWLINGS THAT BET ON THE DERBY DEMANDED SIR HARRY HIS FACE VERY RED AND ONLY THE GHOST OF HIS SMILE GRINNING THERE
WELL DORKIE LOVE WHAT'S THE MATTER SAID STANLEY SHARPLY AT LAST BREAKING THE SILENCE
NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER I VENTURE TO THINK
IF ANYTHING CROSSES YOUR MIND A WORD WITH MR DE C
AND ALTHOUGH AT THIS MOMENT IT IS NOT IN MY POWER TO REWARD YOUR INVALUABLE ASSISTANCE NOW REALLY MY DEAR SIR I MUST INSIST--NO MORE OF THIS I BESEECH YOU
I SAY I DON'T CARE A FARTHING
THIS MORNING A LETTER CAME AT BREAKFAST BY POST AND WHEN HE HAD READ IT THE POOR VICAR GREW A LITTLE WHITE AND HE FOLDED IT VERY QUIETLY AND PUT IT IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET AND PATTED LITTLE FAIRY ON THE HEAD
I FANCY HE HAS ENOUGH TO LIVE UPON WITHOUT ADDING TO IT HOWEVER I SAID
THEY TOO HAVE READY--HAVING OFTEN PROVED THEIR CONSOLATORY EFFICACY--THEIR FEBRIFUGES AND THEIR TONICS CULLED FROM THAT TREE OF LIFE WHOSE LEAVES ARE FOR THE HEALING OF THE NATIONS POOR RACHEL'S HOURS WERE DARK AND LIFE HAD GROWN IN SOME SORT TERRIBLE AND DEATH SEEMED NOW SO REAL AND NEAR--AYE QUITE A FACT--AND SOMEHOW NOT UNFRIENDLY
GREAT CONSOLATIONS GREAT CHASTISEMENTS
THE IDEA OF HOLDING MISS BRANDON TO THIS ENGAGEMENT AND PROROGUING HER NUPTIALS FROM DAY TO DAY TO CONVENIENCE THE BRIDEGROOM--ABSENT WITHOUT EXPLANATION--WAS OF COURSE QUITE UNTENABLE
BUT WITH AN EFFORT SHE SMILED AND SAID WITH A LITTLE SHIVER THE AIR HAS GROWN QUITE CHILL AND THE SUN NEARLY SET
I FORGET ALL THE OTHER GOOD THINGS HE DID
CAPTAIN LAKE'S FEW HOURS SLEEP CONTRARY TO POPULAR IDEAS ABOUT GAMESTERS SLUMBERS HAD BEEN THE SOUNDEST AND THE MOST NATURAL WHICH HE HAD ENJOYED FOR A GOOD MANY NIGHTS
OF COURSE THERE WAS SOME SATIRE IN GYLINGDEN
BUT I LIKE HER AND I WISH YOU'D ADVISE ME HE WAS TALKING AFTER HIS WONT TO THE CARPET
THE MARRIAGE HAD BEEN AFTER ALL AS GREAT A SURPRISE TO RACHEL AS TO ANY OF THE GYLINGDEN GOSSIPS
BUT THE UNFORTUNATE GIRL YOU WERE GOING TO SAY--THANK YOU
BUT THE NARROW WALK THAT TURNED FROM REDMAN'S DELL WAS ALWAYS DARK IN STANLEY'S MEMORY
WHAT MODERN NECROMANCERS CONVERSING WITH TABLES CALL MOCKING SPIRITS HAVE ALWAYS USURPED THEIR PLACE WITH US
IF YOU MENTION IT TO HIM HE'LL GO UP WITH YOU TO REDMAN'S FARM AND TAKE THE DEPOSITION
UNDER THE COLD SHADOW OF LADY CHELFORD THE PROPRIETIES FLOURISHED AND GENERALLY VERY LITTLE ELSE
AND TRUSTED THAT BUSINESS WAS IMPROVING
I CAN'T SAY WHETHER MISS BRANDON DEIGNED TO FOLLOW HIM WITH HER DARK DREAMY GAZE
I WAS SICK OF THE SERVICE AND NO WONDER
NO--NO MORE I THANK YOU
MY EVIDENCE IS CONCLUSIVE I DON'T KNOW WHAT MR LARKIN WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT
AND TAKE THE BASKET AND COME BACK BY THE SIDE DOOR CROAKED OLD TAMAR
HE WISHED HIMSELF MORE THAN ONCE WELL OUT OF THIS CONFOUNDED PASS AND LISTENED NERVOUSLY FOR A GOOD WHILE AND STARED ONCE MORE HALF-FRIGHTENED IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS INTO THE DARKNESS
THE VICAR WOULD HAVE HAD TO SEEK OUT THE ATTORNEY TO LIE IN WAIT FOR AND TO WOO HIM
A BOLD FRANK GOOD-HUMOURED FELLOW--HE PLAYED AT ELECTIONS AS HE WOULD AT CRICKET
I HAD NOT AN OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING HER ACQUAINTANCE YESTERDAY
CHAPTER V
HA!--SUCH AN OLD GOOSE AND SHE WIPED HER EYES AGAIN
MY OLD EYES HAVE SEEN HIM THERE WALKING BACK AND FORWARD LYING AT CATCH FOR SOME ONE THIS NIGHT--THE GREAT ENEMY OF MAN
AT ANY RATE I WAS A FOOL AND I THINK I'M RUINED
AND THERE ARE TWO MEN WRITING IN THE DUTCH ROOM VERY BUSILY IT MUST BE ABOUT THE ELECTION WHAT ELECTION DEAR ASKED RACHEL
HE WISHED AS WAS HIS CUSTOM EVERYTHING ABOVE-BOARD AND SUCH AN OPINION AS MIGHT BE PUBLISHED BY EITHER CLIENT IN THE TIMES NEXT DAY IF HE PLEASED IT
WHY COULD HE NOT PUT HIS HEAD IN AT THE DOOR AND CALL HIM
I_'M NOT HALF GOOD ENOUGH FOR SUCH COMPANY--AND THE PLACE IS GROWING RATHER COLD--IS NOT IT A GREAT MANY WYLDERS SIR--A GREAT MANY WYLDERS AND THE ATTORNEY DROPPED HIS VOICE AND PAUSED AT THIS EMPHASIS POINTING A LONG FINGER TOWARD THE SURROUNDING EFFIGIES
WE WERE NOT FAR FROM REDMAN'S FARM AND IT WAS AGREED ON HASTY CONSULTATION THAT OUR BEST COURSE WOULD BE TO CARRY LAKE THITHER AT ONCE BY THE FOOTPATH AND THAT ONE OF US--WEALDON UNDERTOOK THIS--SHOULD DRIVE THE CARRIAGE ON AND APPRISING RACHEL ON THE WAY OF THE ACCIDENT WHICH HAD HAPPENED AND THAT HER BROTHER WAS ON HIS WAY THITHER SHOULD DRIVE ON TO BUDDLE'S HOUSE SENDING ASSISTANCE TO US FROM THE TOWN
I SUPPOSE THERE WERE FEW WAKING HEADS AT THIS HOUR IN ALL THE WIDE PARISH OF GYLINGDEN THOUGH MANY A USUALLY IDLE ONE WAS NOW BUSY ENOUGH ABOUT THE GREAT POLITICAL STRUGGLE WHICH WAS TO MUSTER ITS NATIVE FORCES BOTH IN BOROUGH AND COUNTY AND AGITATE THESE RURAL REGIONS WITH THE ROAR AND COMMOTION OF CIVIL STRIFE
WHEN AT LAST WITH ANOTHER GREAT SIGH SHE LIFTED HER HEAD HER EYES RESTED ON OLD TAMAR'S FACE AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIRE-PLACE WITH A DARK DULL SURPRISE AND PUZZLE FOR A MOMENT AS IF SHE COULD NOT TELL WHY SHE WAS THERE OR WHERE THE PLACE WAS
BUT THIS IS NOT MINE--ONLY IN PART--THAT IS I DARE NOT TELL IT--BUT MAY BE SOON FREE--AND TO US ALL DEAR DORCAS A WOFUL WOFUL DAY WILL IT BE I MADE YOU A PROMISE RACHEL SAID HER BEAUTIFUL COUSIN GRAVELY AND A LITTLE COLDLY AND SADLY TOO
THE CLERKS WERE IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM AT THAT MOMENT PARTAKING OF REFRESHMENT
AND THIS IS THE RESURRECTION OF THE MEMORY THE FORETASTE AND IMAGE WHICH THE FAITHFUL CREATOR ACCORDS US OF THE RESURRECTION AND GLORY TO COME--THE BODY REDEEMED THE SPIRIT MADE PERFECT
WELL YOU KNOW MASTER STANLEY WHAT IT'S ABOUT WELL THERE IS SOMETHING UNPLEASANT AND I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE HEARD A SMATTERING OF IT IN YOUR MUDDLED WAY
HAD LORD CHELFORD BEEN INVOKED AND ANSWERED SATISFACTORILY
I WAS JUST THINKING YOUR DULNESS MIGHT DO THE SAME FOR YOU DRAWLED LAKE
FOR SOMETIMES I THINK I AM ALMOST BEREFT OF--REASON CHAPTER XXXII
D'YE SEE--HEY AND WYLDER WINKED AND GRINNED WITH A WAG OF HIS HEAD
THAT SOME WEEKS AFTERWARDS HE SAW HIM AT BRIGHTON
THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS PLEASANT PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH
I DO NOT KNOW AT ALL HOW MISS BRANDON FELT AT THIS INSTANT
ABOUT THE MATRIMONIAL LIKELIHOODS OF GENTLEMEN WITH TITLES AND ESTATES FAME THAT MOST TUFT-HUNTING OF DIVINITIES IS ALWAYS DISTENDING HER CHEEKS AND BLOWING THE VERY FINEST FLOURISHES HER OLD TRUMPET AFFORDS
HE WALKED ABOUT THE COURTYARD SMOKING LOOKING SOMETIMES ON THE SOLEMN FRONT OF THE OLD PALATIAL MANSION AND SOMETIMES BREATHING A WHITE FILM UP TO THE STARS IMPATIENT LIKE THE ENAMOURED ALADDIN WATCHING IN AMBUSCADE FOR THE EMERGENCE OF THE PRINCESS BADROULBADOUR
WHY OF COURSE SIR I USE THE WORD IN ITS USUAL SENSE--THAT IS THERE WAS A RUMOUR WHEN I WAS LAST IN TOWN AND I REALLY FORGET WHO TOLD ME
BARS OF SUNSHINE FALL THROUGH THE BRANCHES ABOVE ACROSS THE THICK TAPESTRY OF BLUE YELLOW AND CRIMSON THAT GLOW SO RICHLY UPON THEIR DEEP GREEN GROUND
HE WENT INTO THE SUPPER-ROOM AND HAD A GLASS OF SELTZER WATER AND SHERRY
I MUST HAVE A GOOD HANDFUL OF MONEY BY MAY NEXT
SHE IS A SPLENDID BEAUTY AND WHEN YOU SEE HER YOU'LL SAY ANY FELLOW MIGHT BE PROUD OF SUCH A BRIDE
YOU'D BETTER STAY WHERE YOU ARE MISS
IT IS REALLY RATHER A COMPLIMENT AND RELIEVES ME OF THE UNPLEASANT NECESSITY OF SAYING--NO YET MR LARKIN WAS VERY SORE AND CURIOUS AND IN A MEASURE HATED BOTH LAKE AND WYLDER FOR THEIR SECRET CONFIDENCES AND WAS MORE THAN EVER RESOLVED TO GET AT THE HEART OF MARK'S MYSTERY
THE MARE NOW LYING NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE GORGE HAD I BELIEVE FALLEN UPON HIM AND THEN TUMBLED OVER
AND WORSE STILL HE HAD LENT THAT COSTLY LOAN HIS SIGN MANUAL ON TWO OR THREE OCCASIONS TO FRIENDS IN NEED AND ONE WAY OR ANOTHER FOUND THAT ON WINDING UP AND CLOSING HIS CAMBRIDGE LIFE HIS ASSETS FELL SHORT OF HIS LIABILITIES VERY SERIOUSLY
LET HIM COME IN AND SO IN COMES JIM DUTTON AGAIN TO HEAR PARTICULARS AND HAVE AS HE HOPES HIS ENGAGEMENT RATIFIED
BEAR THAT IN MIND DEAR DORCAS
AND HE TALKED UPON THIS THEME TILL THE GOOD LADY MARVELLING HOW SO GREAT A MAN COULD BE SO HUMBLE WAS CALLED TO THE RECEIPT OF CUSTOM ON THE SUBJECT OF PARADISE AND LEMON-DROPS AND THE HEAVENLY-MINDED ATTORNEY WITH A CELESTIAL CONDESCENSION RECOGNISED HIS TWO LITTLE ACQUAINTANCES OF THE STREET AND ACTUALLY ADDING ANOTHER HALFPENNY TO HIS BOUNTY--ESCAPED WITH A HASTY FAREWELL AND A SMILE TO THE STREET AS EAGER TO EVADE THE THANKS OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE AND THE ADMIRATION OF MRS MULLOCK
AND AS HE STOOD OPPOSITE LAKE CONVERSING WITH NOW AND AGAIN AN EARNEST GESTURE HE SHOWED A PROFILE WHICH MR LARCOM KNEW VERY WELL
SHE HAD BREAKFASTED WITH OLD LADY CHELFORD THAT MORNING AND THIS WAS MY FIRST MEETING THAT DAY
I HEARD WHAT MISS RADIE SAID
WHAT A DELIVERANCE FOR THE GOOD ATTORNEY
SO I TOOK UP A BOOK PUT IT DOWN AND THEN WENT AND LOOKED OVER WYLDER'S SHOULDER AND MADE MY CRITICISMS--NOT VERY NOVEL I FEAR--UPON THE PAGES HE TURNED OVER
NOW THIS PROCEEDING OF MR WYLDER'S AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME STRUCK THE RIGHTEOUS ATTORNEY AND REASONABLY AS A VERY SERIOUS AND UNJUSTIFIABLE STEP
THE SUDDENNESS AND THE NATURE OF THE DISCLOSURES WERE DREAM-LIKE AND UNREAL AND THE IMAGE OF DORCAS REMAINED IMPRESSED UPON HER SIGHT
AND--AND ANY NEWS IN THAT QUARTER OF MR MARK WYLDER--ANY--ANY SURMISE
OLD TAMAR DIED THREE YEARS SINCE AND LIES IN THE PRETTY LITTLE CHURCHYARD OF GYLINGDEN
LARKIN MADE HIS OWN HANDSOME ESTIMATE OF HIS EXPENSES AND THE VALUE OF HIS TIME TO AND FROM LONDON AND THEN HE CHARGED THIS IN ITS ENTIRETY--SHALL WE SAY INTEGRITY--TO EACH CLIENT SEPARATELY
LAKE YOU SEE WANTED WEIGHT AND NOTHWITHSTANDING HIS CONNECTIONS WAS IT COULD NOT BE DENIED A NEW MAN IN THE COUNTY
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IS QUITE DIFFERENT AND REALLY NOTHING THAT NEED AFFECT YOU
I'M SUCH A FOOL I MUST ONLY GO TO THE SHERIFF THE FIRST THING THE MORNING AND BEG OF HIM TO HOLD OVER THAT THING YOU KNOW UNTIL I HAVE HEARD FROM BURLINGTON AND SMITH
FOR LAKE LIKE A FOOL CHUCKED A LOT OF GRAPES IN HIS FACE--FOR NOTHING BY GEORGE THE DOCTOR SHORT AND BROAD WAS NOW STUMPING UP THE STRAIGHT AVENUE UNDER THE NOBLE TREES THAT ROOFED IT OVER AND MAJOR JACKSON SAUNTERED ABOUT IN THE VICINITY OF THE GATE MORE INTERESTED IN LAKE'S SAFETY THAN HE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED POSSIBLE A DAY OR TWO BEFORE
YOU ARE MORE IN HIS CONFIDENCE THAN WE ARE SAID LAKE
HE HAS SET HIS HEART UPON THIS MARRIAGE AND I REALLY THINK YOU WILL ALMOST DRIVE HIM MAD IF YOU ACT AS YOU THREATEN YOU HAVE INDEED DEAR LADY CHELFORD BEEN ALWAYS VERY KIND TO ME AND I DO TRUST YOU REPLIED THIS BEAUTIFUL HEIRESS TURNING HER LARGE SHADOWY EYES UPON THE DOWAGER AND SPEAKING IN SLOW AND SILVERY ACCENTS SOMEHOW VERY MELANCHOLY
THESE UNDULATIONS AND ALL THAT SPLENDID TIMBER AND THE GLORIOUS RUINS ON THAT HILLOCK OVER THERE
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING UNUSUALLY GENTLE ALMOST RESEMBLING TENDERNESS IN HIS MANNER
YOU'LL BOTH LIVE TO THANK ME FOR THIS ALL THIS TIME LITTLE FAIRY UNHEEDED WAS BAWLING IN GREAT ANGUISH OF SOUL CLINGING TO RACHEL'S DRESS AND CRYING--'OH
I EXPECT YOUR INFLUENCE AND IF YOU DON'T USE IT AND EFFECTUALLY IT WILL BE WORSE FOR YOU
IT'S A CONFOUNDED DEAL MORE LIKE THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH IN PILGRIM'S PROGRESS"--YOU REMEMBER--THAT OLD TAMAR USED TO READ TO US IN THE NURSERY REPLIED MASTER STANLEY WHO HAD NEVER ENJOYED BEING QUIZZED BY HIS SISTER NOT BEING BLESSED WITH A REMARKABLY SWEET TEMPER
I'M SO GLAD I SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING YOU HERE SAID DORCAS
EXQUISITE INDEED SAID LORD CHELFORD
MISS BRANDON WAS PLAINLY NOT A PERSON TO MAKE ANY SORT OF EXERTION TOWARDS WHAT IS TERMED KEEPING UP A CONVERSATION
LARKIN SMILED BENIGNANTLY AND WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING NO DOUBT WORTH HEARING BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED AND HIS OLD COOK AND ELDERLY PARLOUR-MAID--NO BREATH OF SCANDAL EVER TROUBLED THE SERENE FAIR FAME OF HIS HOUSEHOLD AND EVERYONE ALLOWED THAT IN THE PRUDENTIAL VIRTUES AT LEAST HE WAS NEARLY PERFECT--AND SLEDDON THE GROOM WALKED IN WITH THOSE SAD FACES WHICH I SUPPOSE WERE FIRST LEARNED IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY WERE ACCEPTABLE TO THEIR MASTER
THAT YOU KNOW WAS NEVER MORE THAN A MERE WHISPER
I DO MOST EARNESTLY INSIST THAT YOU PROMISE ME YOU WILL NEVER MENTION THE MATTER OF PROFESSIONAL REMUNERATION MORE UNTIL AT LEAST I PRESS IT WHICH RELY UPON IT WILL NOT BE FOR A GOOD WHILE THE ATTORNEY'S SMILE PLAINLY SAID THAT HIS GOOD WHILE MEANT IN FACT NEVER THIS IS INDEED UNIMAGINABLE KINDNESS
AND NOT ONLY SO BUT IN SOME SORT AT HER DIGESTION ALSO WHICH SHE CHOSE SHOULD TAKE PLACE FOR SOME TEN MINUTES IN THE CHAIR THAT SHE OCCUPIED AT THE SUPPER TABLE
THAT IS ALL I CAN SAY
BUT AS I SAID POOR RADIE SHE CAN'T REASON
EYE AND HAND FOOT AND BAT HE MUST STAND TENSE YET FLEXIBLE LITHE AND SWIFT AS LIGHTNING READY FOR EVERYTHING--CUT BLOCK SLIP OR HIT TO LEG
I'LL RUN DOWN AND SEND UP THE DOCTOR AND HE'LL TAKE HIM ON IF HE CAN BEAR IT MAJOR JACKSON DID NOT RUN
INDEED YOU HAVE LIFTED A MOUNTAIN FROM IT BY THE TIMELY PROFFER OF YOUR INVALUABLE ASSISTANCE AGAIN THE ATTORNEY WAVED OFF WITH A BENIGNANT AND HUMBLE SMILE RATHER OPPRESSIVE TO SEE ALL IDEA OF OBLIGATION AND ACCOMPANIED HIS GRATEFUL CLIENT TO THE GLASS DOOR OF HIS LITTLE PORCH WHERE FAIRY WAS ALREADY AWAITING HIM WITH THE GLOVES IN HIS HAND
ON THE GREEN THE VICAR WITH HIS PRETTY BOY BY THE HAND PASSED HIM NOT A HUNDRED YARDS OFF LIKE A SHIP AT SEA
I LOOK A-HEAD A BIT EH
THEY WERE WORTH RISKING SOMETHING
THERE WAS A STOP PRESS THAT EVENING IN THE COUNTY PAPER--'WE HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT A BODY HAS BEEN DISINTERRED EARLY THIS AFTERNOON UNDER VERY STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF GYLINGDEN
IT HAS BROKEN UP HIS HARD PROUD HEART HE SAYS
THE STEPS APPROACHED
WELL MR LARCOM PRAY SIT DOWN
THE CHURCH-YARD METEOR EXPIRED THERE WAS NOTHING IN A MOMENT BUT HIS ORDINARY SMILE OF RECOGNITION
HE DID NOT CARE TO ENTER FEELING A LITTLE GUILTY ALTHOUGH HE EXPLAINED ON THE WAY ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
AND THEN YOU SEE YOUR FEELINGS MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT AND ALL THAT
I TELL YOU STANLEY PLAINLY I WILL NOT SELL
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WRITE NOW WILLIE DEAR EXPOSTULATED HIS GOOD LITTLE WIFE YOU HAVE NOT TASTED YOUR TEA YET I HAVE INDEED DEAR
HE SAYS THEY'LL NEVER HAVE THEM IN TIME UNLESS HE GOES AND BLOWS THEM UP
SUCH A TASK MISS LAKE WOULD BE MOST PAINFUL TO ME
AND SHE HELD HER TONGUE AND KNITTED HER WHITE WORSTEDS WHEN SHE COULD SIT QUIET--WHICH WAS MOST HOURS OF THE DAY
AND THERE I LAY BREATHLESS FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME NOT FAR FROM TEN MINUTES DURING WHICH THERE WAS NO SOUND NOR OTHER SYMPTOM OF ITS PRESENCE
AND I'M SURE FROM WHAT BRACTON HAS SAID TO ME--I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY--THAT DORCAS LIKES HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED IT IS VERY HAPPY FOR HER AT LEAST THEY ARE NOT SAID RACHEL AND A LONG SILENCE ENSUED
AND DORCAS SAID YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE MUSIC ON THE WATERS THAT LURES MARINERS TO DESTRUCTION
MISS LAKE AS SHE DROVE THAT NIGHT TOWARD GYLINGDEN SAID LITTLE TO THE VICAR'S WIFE WHOSE GOOD HUSBAND HAD BEEN AWAY TO FRIARS MAKING A SICK-CALL AND SHE PRATTLED ON VERY MERRILY ABOUT HIS FRUGAL LITTLE TEA AWAITING HIS LATE RETURN AND ASKED HER TWICE ON THE WAY HOME WHETHER IT WAS HALF-PAST NINE FOR SHE DID NOT BOAST A WATCH
IN FACT HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD THE SCORE AT ANY POINT OF THE GAME
I'M VERY GLAD YOU CAME RADIE SAID A SWEET VOICE WHICH SOMEHOW MADE HER SHIVER CLOSE TO HER EAR
I'LL LOSE MY LIFE BUT HE SHALL PAY THE FORFEIT OF HIS CRIME SO SAYING RACHEL LEFT THE ROOM AND GLIDING THROUGH PASSAGES AND DOWN STAIRS SHE KNOCKED AT STANLEY'S DOOR
OH WAS IT POSSIBLE BUT MEMORY WOULD CALL UP THE VICAR FROM HIS HALF-WRITTEN SERMON
YOU MUST TELL ME ALL THE NEWS AND I'LL SHOW YOU MY HOUSE AND AMAZE YOU WITH MY HOUSEKEEPING
THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT HIM TO EXCITE THE LEAST UNEASINESS
HERE HE IS CRIED JEKYL
HE WAS A STAINED MAN AND WAS LIABLE AT ANY MOMENT TO BE BRANDED
MY CHAIR WAS BESIDE MISS BRANDON
ONE OR TWO COVENANTS AND MODIFICATIONS IN THE ARTICLES HAD STRUCK HIM AS DESIRABLE ON READING THE INSTRUMENT OVER WITH WILLIAM WYLDER
LARKIN DOES NOT LIKE THE CAPTAIN A BIT TOO WELL--AND HE HAS THE WILL OFF EVERY WORD OF IT
BUT THEIR POACHERS WERE NOT OF THE DANGEROUS SORT AND THERE HAD NOT BEEN A ROBBER ABOUT GYLINGDEN WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN
LARKIN HAD STRUCK OUT A MASTERLY PLAN
I WAS NOT AWARE HE HAD THAT FAILING OH YES
AND HOW COULD I HAVE ANTICIPATED THE STRANGE TURN THINGS HAVE TAKEN
AN ANSWER IS THERE SAID MR LARKIN DRAWING IT FROM HIS POCKET AND LOOKING AT IT AGAIN WITH A PERCEPTIBLE CURIOSITY
THERE WAS A COMPLICATED COUSINSHIP AMONG THESE BRANDONS WYLDERS AND LAKES--INEXTRICABLE INTERMARRIAGES WHICH FIVE YEARS AGO BEFORE I RENOUNCED THE BAR I HAD AT MY FINGERS ENDS BUT WHICH HAD NOW RELAPSED INTO HAZE
BUT RACHEL AT LAST SAID STANLEY YOU MEDITATE SOME INJURY TO MARK WYLDER I RADIE HE ANSWERED QUIETLY WHY ON EARTH SHOULD YOU THINK SO I SAW YOU TWICE WATCH HIM WHEN YOU THOUGHT NO ONE OBSERVED YOU--AND I KNOW YOUR FACE TOO WELL STANLEY TO MISTAKE NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE RADIE
THE ROAD WAS HARDLY TWO YARDS WIDE AND THE WOOD WALLED IT IN AND OVERHUNG IT OCCASIONALLY IN THICK IRREGULAR MASSES
BUT IN PROPORTION TO MY EXPENSES--A WOMAN OF COURSE CAN LIVE ON LESS THAN HALF WHAT A MAN CAN--I'M A GREAT DEAL POORER THAN YOU
SHE ROSE UP LIKE THE GRIM WHITE WOMAN WHO HAUNTS YON WOOD BEFORE HIM
WELL MIGHT THE GOOD MAN GLOW WITH A HAPPY CONSCIOUSNESS OF A BLESSING
THE PONIES BEING GRAVE AND TRUSTWORTHY AND HAVING THE ROAD QUITE TO THEMSELVES NEEDED LITTLE LOOKING AFTER AND MISS BRANDON WAS FREE TO CONVERSE WITH HER COMPANION
WHEN I AM QUITE WELL AGAIN WHISPERED THE LITTLE MAN WON'T YOU BRING ME TO THE CASTLE MEADOW WHERE THE WEE RIVER IS AND WE'LL FLOAT RACES WITH DAISIES AND BUTTERCUPS--THE WAY YOU DID ON MY BIRTHDAY THEY SAY THAT LITTLE MANNIKIN SUDDENLY THE VICAR STOPPED
BUT HAVING DISABLED AND STRUCK HIM DOWN AND WON THE STAKES HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WHAT REMAINED OF HIM HIS COLD WHITE HAND TO SHAKE OR SIPPED CLARET WITH HIM AT HIS OWN TABLE AND TOLD HIM STORIES AND ENTERTAINED HIM WITH SLY SARCASTIC SALLIES AND THOUGHT HOW HE COULD MAKE USE OF HIM IN AN AMICABLE WAY
I LIKE THAT GOOD AND SIMPLE WELSH PARSON OF BEAUMARIS NEAR TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHO WITH A SAD SORT OF HUMOUR PLACED FOR MOTTO UNDER HIS PORTRAIT DONE IN STAINED GLASS NUNC PRIMUM TRANSPARUI
I'M AN OLD WOMAN MY DEAR AND I SHA'N'T TROUBLE YOU VERY LONG
YOU MAY AND YOU SHALL HEAR--IN FACT I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE THING
WHAT THEN DID RACHEL MEAN BY ALL THAT ESCAPED HER WHEN HE WAS IN DANGER
SIR HENRY TWISDEN CAN'T HOLD HIS SEAT--HE'S ALL BUT BROKE--AS POOR AS JOB AND THE GENTRY HATE HIM AND HE LIVES ABROAD
AND I'M GLAD HE'S NOT AMONG THEM ANY LONGER TO LEARN BAD WAYS--I AM SO THE DRAWING-ROOM BEING PREPARED RACHEL BID TAMAR AND LITTLE MARGERY GOOD-NIGHT AND THE SLEEPY LITTLE HANDMAID STUMPED OFF TO HER BED
AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MRS DOROTHY ONLY REMARKING SERIOUSLY IT IS VERY PRETTY AND APPROPRIATE AND WYLDER MAKING NO REMARK HELPED HIMSELF TO A CUP OF COFFEE AND THEN TO A GLASS OF CURACOA AND THEN LOOKED INDUSTRIOUSLY AT A SPANISH QUARTO OF DON QUIXOTE AND LASTLY WALKED OVER TO ME ON THE HEARTHRUG
BUT YOU KNOW THE FACT IS WE SOLICITORS SELDOM HAVE THE COMMAND OF OUR OWN MONEY
DO YOU ALLUDE TO A LEGAL MATTER ENQUIRED LARKIN WITH HIS LOOK OF INSINUATING CONCERN AND ENQUIRY
YOU WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE A NEW MAMMA
HOW THE MOTHER OF ROBIN SAID TO HER HUSBAND MY HONEY MY LOVE AND MY DEAR AND ALL THIS FOR LEAVE TO RIDE WITH HER SON TO SEE HER OWN BROTHER AT GAMWELL I REMEMBER SAID DORCAS WITH A SMILE
WYLDER'S LEVANTING IN THIS WAY WAS SINGULARLY DISCONCERTING
IT IS I MISS LAKE MR JOSIAH LARKIN OF THE LODGE SAID THAT GENTLEMAN WITH WHAT HE MEANT TO BE AN AIR OF DIGNIFIED FIRMNESS AND LOOKING VERY LIKE A TALL CONSTABLE IN POSSESSION
THE MEASURES WHICH YOU HAVE ADOPTED ARE I THINK MOST JUDICIOUS
IT WILL MAKE A DEUCED FINE ESTATE
DEAR LARKIN,--I HOPE YOU DID THE THREE COMMISSIONS ALL RIGHT
HOW LONG SINCE THAT COLD CRYSTAL HAD GLOWED WITH THE RIPPLES OF WINE
LARKIN TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD DONE ALL IN HIS POWER TO SATISFY THEM OF THE BONA FIDE CHARACTER OF HIS REVEREND CLIENT'S DEALINGS FROM THE FIRST
THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTING BUT MAY SOMETIMES BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THERE BEING NOTHING REALLY TO DISCOVER
SHE WAS MORE NERVOUS THOUGH NOT LESS COURAGEOUS THAN FORMERLY
LAKE POURED OUT SOME SHERRY IN A TUMBLER AND DRANK IT OFF
I WISH YOU WERE MORE PLEASANTLY LODGED RADIE
YOU HAVE ONLY JUST HEARD IT RACHEL DEAREST AND YOU ARE STARTLED
IT IS NOT BEAUTIFUL I ALLOW
FOR HE'S A SHY YOUTH AND MUST BE ENCOURAGED HE GAVE ME A CHEERFUL SLAP ON THE SHOULDER AS HE UTTERED THIS AGREEABLE BIT OF BANTER AND ALTOGETHER DISCONCERTED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
HE LOOKED AS IF HE COULD HAVE MURDERED HIM
I THINK BEFORE TROUBLING HIS LORDSHIP UPON THE SUBJECT--IF INDEED ON REFLECTION YOU SHOULD NOT THINK IT WOULD BE A LITTLE ODD TO TROUBLE HIM AT ALL IN REFERENCE TO IT--I HAD BETTER LOOK A LITTLE MORE CAREFULLY INTO THE PAPERS AND SEE WHETHER ANYTHING IN THAT DIRECTION IS REALLY PRACTICABLE AT ALL DO YOU THINK MR LARKIN YOU CAN WRITE THAT STRONG LETTER TO STAY PROCEEDINGS WHICH YOU INTENDED YESTERDAY THE ATTORNEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID WITH A SAD SORT OF DRYNESS--'I CAN'T SEE MY WAY TO IT THE VICAR'S HEART SANK WITH A FLUTTER AND THEN SWELLED AND SANK ANOTHER BIT AND HIS FOREHEAD FLUSHED
AND YOU DON'T THINK WORSE OF ME I'M VERY SURE CAPTAIN LAKE FOR A LITTLE INDISCREET ZEAL ON BEHALF OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS TREATED ME WITH SUCH UNLIMITED CONFIDENCE AS MR WYLDER
AND IN ACCORD WITH THE TEMPESTUOUS AND DISMAL WEATHER THE FORTUNES OF THE REV
BUT GOD SEES BOTH THEIR VEIL AND THEIR FACE AND I KNOW NOT WHETHER HE MORE HATES THEIR VEIL OF DISSIMULATION OR THEIR FACE OF WICKEDNESS CAPTAIN LAKE WANTED REST--SLEEP--QUIET THOUGHTS AT ALL EVENTS
HIRAM AND JACOBS TRANSMITTED UNDER COVER TO CAPTAIN LAKE'S TOWN SOLICITOR
WHO MADE YOU A PROPHET
SHE FELT HIS VILLAINY TURNING WITH A COWARDLY AND MERCILESS TREASON UPON HER FORLORN SELF
I RECOVERED MYSELF
HER DREADFUL INTERVIEW WITH JOS
BUT LAKE WAS NOW MARRIED AND UNDER THE INCANTATION WHISTLED OVER HIM BY THE TOOTHLESS ARCHDEACON OF MUNDLEBURY HAD SPRUNG UP INTO A COUNTY MAGNATE AND WAS WORTH CULTIVATING AND TO BE TREATED TENDERLY
HOW FRESH AND PRETTY SHE LOOKS IN THAT SAD SYLVAN SOLITUDE WITH THE BACKGROUND OF THE DULL CRIMSON BRICK AND THE CLIMBING ROSES
YOU ARE ABOUT TO COMMIT AS GROSS AND INDELICATE A BREACH OF FAITH AS I RECOLLECT ANYWHERE TO HAVE HEARD OF
YOU HAVE BEEN ABROAD YOU KNOW
BUT STILL YOU LOVE POOR OLD MAMMA BEST OF ALL
I WAS WOUNDED TO FIND YOU HAD THOUGHTS YOU WOULD NOT TRUST TO ME
SO HE GLIDED UP THE SHORT AISLE WITH A SAD RELIGIOUS SMILE SUITED TO THE PLACE AND INCLINED HIS LANK BACK AND HIS TALL BALD HEAD TOWARD THE CAPTAIN IN CEREMONIOUS GREETING AS HE APPROACHED
AND THERE WAS HIGH FESTIVAL KEPT IN THE PARLOUR THAT NIGHT
BUT HE LOOKED ONCE OR TWICE A LITTLE HARD AT STANLEY LAKE
YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME IN YOUR WILL NUNKIE WON'T YOU
OH THEN WHERE IS MY SON
I WONDER YOU HAVEN'T BECOME AN OLD WOMAN HERE AND HE KISSED HER AND WENT HIS WAY WITH A SLIGHT WAVE OF HIS HAND AND HIS ODD SMILE AS HE CLOSED THE LITTLE GARDEN GATE AFTER HIM
YOU ARE NOT VERY TIRED ARE YOU
HE HELD HER HAND A LITTLE HARDER THAN WAS HIS WONT
I DON'T SAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE EXPRESSED IT IN THESE LITERAL TERMS
LARKIN IN TURNING UP HIS EYES AND GROANING
OH LAKE AVERNUS IS IT SAID LAKE WITH AN ANGRY SNEER AND RAISING HIS HAT WITH A MOCK REVERENCE
I WUD NOT WISH SIR NO NOISE MADE TILL I CUM--WHICH I AM RETURNING HOAME AND WILL THEN TRAVEL TO GYLINGDEN STRATEWAYS TO SEE YOU
I GOT A FANCY INTO MY HEAD THAT LUCK WOULD COME WITH IT AND MAYBE THAT GLASS STUFF WAS THE THING THAT HAD THE VIRTUE IN IT
I WERE MOST UNFORTUNATE--MOST UNFORTUNATE INDEED MISS LAKE IF MY MANNER COULD IN THE LEAST JUSTIFY THE STRONG AND UNDUE LANGUAGE IN WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO CHARACTERISE IT
BETTER MEN MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED SOMETHING OF IT--I DO SOLEMNLY PLEDGE MY HONOUR THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND SO MUCH AS CROSSED MY MIND--NOT NATURALLY SUSPICIOUS I BELIEVE BUT ALL THE MORE SHOCKED CAPTAIN LAKE ON THAT ACCOUNT HE WAS POOR THEN YOU SEE AND A FEW POUNDS WERE EVERYTHING TO HIM AND THE TEMPTATION IMMENSE
STANDING BETWEEN THE LIVING AND THE DEAD HERE REUBEN HERE
HE WAS SUCH A PRETTY FELLOW WITH HIS FAT WHITE CHEEKS AND LONG NOSE AND HE LOOKED HALF ASLEEP
HE MERELY MENTIONED IT AND MADE NO COMMENT
AND WHEN I WAS NO MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLD I REFUSED TO SAY MY PRAYERS FOR HER
A STEP WAS HEARD AT THE THRESHOLD--IT ENTERED THE HALL
IN THE MEANTIME THE DOGS CONTINUED THEIR UNACCOUNTABLE YELLING CLOSE BY
THE CANDLES WERE STILL BURNING IN THE SITTING-ROOM AND THE LIGHT WAS DAZZLING AFTER THE PROFOUND DARKNESS IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN FOR SO LONG
I THINK THIS LITTLE BIT OF MUSIC--IT WAS GOT UP YOU KNOW BY THAT OLD QUIZ DOWAGER LADY CHELFORD--WAS REALLY NOT SO BAD--A RATHER GOOD IDEA AFTER ALL MISS LAKE
HE HAD TO LOOK FOR A TIME AT THE DISTANT PROSPECT TO ALLOW HIS SMILE TO SUBSIDE AND TO PERMIT THE CONSCIOUS TRIUMPH WHICH HE KNEW BEAMED THROUGH HIS FEATURES TO DISCHARGE ITSELF AND EVAPORATE IN THE LIGHT AND AIR BEFORE TURNING TO MR LARCOM WHICH HE DID WITH AN AIR OF SUDDEN RECOLLECTION
AT ALL EVENTS IT IS HER RIGHT TO KNOW ALL--AND SHE SHALL
LESS THAN TEN MINUTES MORE WOULD SET ME DOWN AT ITS DOOR-STEPS
THERE WAS SOMETHING ESTRANGED AND THREATENING
BUT JOS
BUT JOS
IT WAS STRICTLY A LIFE ESTATE
LARKIN DRAWING A STEP OR TWO BACKWARD
EVERY DAY THE POSITION GREW MORE CRITICAL AND EMBARRASSING
HE LOOKS UNCOMMON BAD AND I AND MRS ESTERBROKE THE HOUSEKEEPER MY LORD THOUGHT YOU WOULD NOT LIKE HE SHOULD DIE OUT OF DOORS HAS SHE GOT YOUR MISTRESS'S DIRECTIONS MISS BRANDON IS NOT CALLED UP MY LORD AND MRS ESTERBROKE IS UNWILLIN TO HALARM HER
WELL I WILL AND STANDING HE DRANK NEARLY HALF THE CUP SHE HAD POURED OUT FOR HIM AND SET IT DOWN AND FELT IN HIS POCKET SHE THOUGHT FOR HIS KEYS
IT WAS TRACED BY THE HAND OF POOR OLD MISS KYBES--WITH HER MANY FAULTS ALWAYS KIND TO ME
AND THAT FROM DORCAS BRANDON MEANS YOU KNOW EVERYTHING I DON'T KNOW THAT IT MEANS ANYTHING
I ASSURE YOU DORCAS I REALLY AM BUSY
AND DURING HER WEEK'S CONFINEMENT TO HER ROOM HER SON CONTRIVED SO THAT SHE CONSENTED TO STAY FOR THE ODIOUS CEREMONY AND WAS EVEN SOURLY CIVIL TO MISS LAKE WHO RECEIVED HER ADVANCES QUITE AS COLDLY AS THEY WERE MADE
THAT BOW WINDOW IS WORTH ALL THE PICTURES IN BRANDON
OH YOU DON'T KNOW--HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS--THE DANGER WE ARE IN
THE EXCELLENT MAN'S RELIGION WAS WE KNOW A LITTLE JEWISH AND RESTED UPON TEMPORAL REWARDS AND COMFORTS
WHILE HE WAS BUTTONING HIS WALKING BOOTS WITH HIS FOOT ON THE CHAIR BEFORE THE FIRE A TAP AT HIS STUDY DOOR SURPRISED HIM
WHY WILL YOU NOT BELIEVE ME
NOW MISS LAKE I HAVE STATED NO PARTICULARS BUT DO YOU THINK THAT KNOWING ALL THIS AND KNOWING THE FRAUD BY WHICH YOUR ABSENCE WAS COVERED AND PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDING AS EVERY MAN CONVERSANT WITH THIS SINFUL WORLD MUST DO THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF ALL THIS I COULD DREAM OF PERMITTING YOU MISS LAKE TO BECOME DOMESTICATED AS AN INMATE IN THE FAMILY OF A PURE-MINDED THOUGH SIMPLE AND UNFORTUNATE CLERGYMAN IT MAY BECOME MY DUTY HE RESUMED TO PROSECUTE A SEARCHING ENQUIRY MADAM INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MR MARK WYLDER'S DISAPPEARANCE
THERE--DON'T BLESS ME
HOW TREMENDOUS YOU WILL NOT BE SO FRIGHTENED IN A LITTLE TIME
AND IF THAT WERE SO NONE OF US WOULD EVER INHERIT THE PROPERTY
I KNEW THAT TREMULOUS CROSS
IF CAPTAIN LAKE CHOOSES TO DRIVE YOU NEED NOT COME
HE RECOLLECTED THAT ONLY FIFTY YARDS BACK THEY HAD PASSED A SPADE AND PICK LYING WITH SOME OTHER TOOLS BY THE SIDE OF THE PATH NEAR THAT BIT OF OLD WALL WHICH WAS BEING REMOVED
HE NEVER WOULD ENTER BRANDON AS ITS MASTER AND NEVER WILL DURING DORCAS BRANDON'S LIFETIME
BRACTON'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU THE FACT IS CAPTAIN LAKE AN ACCOMPLISHED PLAYER MADE A PRETTY LITTLE REVENUE OF SIR HARRY'S BILLIARDS WHICH WERE WILD AND NOISY
IT WAS WELL FOR DRIVER THE POSTMASTER AND HIS DAUGHTERS THAT ALL THE CIRCULARS MADE UP THAT DAY IN BRANDON HALL WERE NOT DESPATCHED THROUGH THE GYLINGDEN POST-OFFICE
HE WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD HIS SAD WALK IN HIS OWN SHY COMPANY
NEVER MIND--THERE--THERE AND BETWEEN WHILES HIS MIND WHICH IN TRUTH HAD A GOOD DEAL UPON IT WOULD WANDER AND PURSUE ITS DISMAL AND PERPLEXED EXPLORATIONS TO THE UNHEARD ACCOMPANIMENT OF HER SOBS
WON'T YOU SHAKE HANDS HE TOOK HER HAND WITH A SMILE
I WRITE TO MENTION THIS AS I MAY BE TOO MUCH HURRIED TO-MORROW WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS NOTE WHEN WEALDON ARRIVED
HE KNEW THIS BURST OF ANGUISH WAS UNAFFECTED
HE KNEW SHE WAS RESOLUTE FIERCE OF WILL AND PROMPT IN ACTION AND NOT TO BE BULLIED
SHOW MR.--MR
I DON'T BELIEVE IT EITHER SIR RESUMED THE ATTORNEY AFTER A LITTLE INTERVAL
DON'T YOU THE BLUE
RACHEL'S POSITION HAD NOT BEEN ALTERED BY HER BROTHER'S MARRIAGE
IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT
HERE THEN NEXT SUNDAY AFTERNOON WHEN THE GOOD VICAR THE REV
IN THE LITTLE HALL STANLEY LOOKED AGAIN AT HIS WATCH AND GETTING QUIETLY OUT WENT SWIFTLY THROUGH THE TINY GARDEN AND ONCE UPON THE MILL-ROAD RAN AT A RAPID PACE DOWN TOWARDS THE TOWN
AND HIS CHEEKS AND FOREHEAD GREW SUDDENLY PINK AND HE COUGHED A LITTLE AND TRIED TO THROW A LOOK OF MILD SURPRISE INTO HIS FACE
THEN HE TOOK OUT HIS CIGAR CASE SELECTED A PROMISING WEED AND WRAPPING THE LACONIC NOTE PRETTILY ROUND ONE OF HIS SCENTED MATCHES LIGHTED IT AND THE NOTE FLAMED PALE IN THE DAYLIGHT AND DROPPED STILL BLAZING AT THE ROOT OF THE OLD TREE HE STOOD BY AND SENT UP A LITTLE CURL OF BLUE SMOKE--AN INCENSE TO THE DEMON OF THE WOOD--AND TURNED IN A MINUTE MORE INTO A BLACK FILM OVERRUN BY A HUNDRED CREEPING SPARKLES
YOU HAVE BEEN VISITING THE SICK AND AFFLICTED AND I WAS PASSING BY
THE PURCHASE OF THE REVERSION WAS TO WAIT AND FRAUDULENT AS WAS THE PRICE AT WHICH HE HAD PROPOSED TO BUY IT HE WAS NOW RESOLVED TO GET IT FOR LESS THAN HALF THAT SUM AND HE WROTE A SHORT NOTE TO THE VICAR WHICH HE FORTHWITH DESPATCHED
SO THE GOOD ATTORNEY PRAYED ON TO THE EDIFICATION OF ALL WHO SAW AND MOTHERS IN THE NEIGHBOURING SEATS WERE SPECIALLY CAREFUL TO PREVENT THEIR CHILDREN FROM WHISPERING OR FIDGETING
HE WILL VIEW THE QUESTION MORE CALMLY THAN YOU OR I CAN
AND SUCH A PRETTY FELLOW
AND IT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A PROPOSITION WHICH WAS ON OTHER GROUNDS UNTENABLE YOU MEAN MISS LAKE'S PROPOSED RESIDENCE HERE--AN ARRANGEMENT IT APPEARS TO ME EVERY WAY MOST DESIRABLE I OBJECTED TO IT ON I WILL SAY MORAL GROUNDS MY LORD
I ASSUMED LADY CHELFORD AS YOU HAD INTERESTED YOURSELF IN ME SO FAR AS TO ORIGINATE THE IDEA OF MY ENGAGEMENT TO MR WYLDER THAT YOU HAD CONSIDERED THESE TO ME VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS A LITTLE AND COULD GIVE ME SATISFACTORY ANSWERS UPON POINTS ON WHICH MY MIND HAS BEEN EMPLOYED FOR SOME DAYS
WHERE IS THAT GIRL MARGERY IN THE KITCHEN MASTER STANLEY SAID SHE COURTESYING AGAIN
IT SEEMS WYLDER--MR WYLDER--HAS MET HIM IN GENEVA FROM WHENCE HE DATES
SHE WROTE SUCH AN ODD NOTE TO-DAY ADDRESSED TO YOU
BUT HE CAN'T BITE YET--HA HA HA
GET TO YOUR BED MARGERY CHILD YOU ARE SLEEPY SAID THE YOUNG LADY KINDLY TO HER QUEER LITTLE MAID-OF-HONOUR
A HORRIBLE ODOUR LOADED THE AIR
LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION
I WONDERED WHAT FIGURE STANLEY WOULD MAKE AS A HUSTINGS ORATOR AND WHAT IMPRESSION IN HIS CANVASS
BUT AT LAST WITH AN ANXIOUS THROB AT HIS HEART HE RECOGNISED THE DINGY ARCHWAY AND THE CRACKED BROWN MARBLE TABLET OVER THE KEYSTONE AND HE RECOGNISED SHIVE'S COURT
WYLDER LOOKED SHARPLY AT HER BUT SHE DID NOT SMILE AND SEEMED TO SPEAK IN GOOD FAITH
AND IN ANY CASE YOU WILL DO ME THE JUSTICE TO UNDERSTAND THAT I FOR MY PART--I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPEAK OF IT
HE WAS NOW SAYING--AS HOLDING HIS WAPSIE'S HAND HE CAPERED ROUND IN FRONT LOOKING UP IN HIS FACE WHY HAS MR LARKIN NO TEETH WHEN HE LAUGHS
AND KNOWING NOW ALL THAT THEN HUNG HEAVY AT THE HEART OF THE FAIR TENANT OF REDMAN'S FARM I SHOULD INDEED WONDER INEXPRESSIBLY WERE IT NOT AS I HAVE JUST SAID THAT I HAVE LONG CEASED TO WONDER AT ANY VAGARIES OF MYSELF OR MY FELLOW CREATURES
AND WHAT IS THIS JOB OF MARTIN'S
AND FROM THAT FIRM I AM SORRY TO SAY A BILL OF COSTS WAS COMING WHEN DEEDS WERE PREPARED AND ALL DONE EXCEEDING THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS
THEY WERE IN MY EYES RESERVED PROPHETESSES WHO COULD SPEAK IF THEY WOULD OF MY OWN FUTURE A POOR SUPPORT DORCAS--A BROKEN REED
AND THE MAJOR SHOOK HIS HAND BRIEFLY BUT HARD AND THE GENTLEMEN PARTED
THE AUSPICIOUS EVENT SO INTERESTING TO OUR COUNTY WHICH WE HAVE THIS DAY TO ANNOUNCE THOUGH FOR SOME TIME UPON THE TAPIS HAS BEEN ATTENDED WITH AS LITTLE PUBLICITY AS POSSIBLE
DON'T MIND ME--YOU HAVEN'T MUCH HITHERTO
BUT I'LL DO AS I HAVE SAID HE SWORE AGAIN AND CHELFORD SHALL HAVE A DISTINCT STATEMENT UNDER MY HAND OF EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED
DORCAS BRANDON DID NOT CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO THE TALK
DON'T--DON'T--_DON'T SHE SAID VEHEMENTLY
BUT A PROPHET IS NEVER HONOURED
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ON MY LIFE STANLEY I'LL ACQUAINT MR WYLDER THIS EVENING WITH WHAT YOU MEDITATE AND THE ATROCIOUS LIBERTY YOU PRESUME--YES SIR THOUGH YOU ARE MY BROTHER THE ATROCIOUS LIBERTY YOU DARE TO TAKE WITH MY NAME--UNLESS YOU PROMISE UPON YOUR HONOUR NOW AND HERE TO DISMISS FOR EVER THE ODIOUS AND UTTERLY RESULTLESS SCHEME CAPTAIN LAKE LOOKED VERY ANGRY AFTER HIS FASHION BUT SAID NOTHING
HE'S OUT OF THE ARMY NOW AND I'M THANKFUL FOR IT
SO HE WAITED SAYING NOW AND THEN A SOOTHING WORD OR TWO
AND YOU MEAN STANLEY TO COERCE HIM BY FEAR INTO A MARRIAGE WITH YOUR PENNILESS SISTER WHO HATES HIM
BUT WHEN HE CAME BACK AT ELEVEN AND HAD COMPLETED HIS EXAMINATION HE TOLD THEM FRANKLY THAT THERE WAS A DECIDED CHANGE
I WAS NEAR LOST AND DID RISE AGAIN
SHE COULD NOT SEE HIS YELLOW EYES NOW AS HE STOOD WITH HIS BACK TO THE WINDOW
THE PEEVISH GLANCE WITH WHICH HE EYED IT BETRAYED A PRESENTIMENT OF SOMETHING UNPLEASANT
THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN--THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME--AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVE THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP-MOUTHED MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW-BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND A SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
YOU WON'T FORGET
WHO COULD IT BE
SO I WITHDREW TO MY CHAMBER WHERE I AM GLAD TO SAY I SAW NOTHING OF UNCLE LORNE
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ROBIN HOOD
MY CASE THOUGHT THAT SEEMINGLY LISTLESS FIGURE ON THE BED
HE HAD LEFT HIS ADDRESS AND WAS IN THE COUNTRY
IF I WERE HE I THINK I SHOULD FLY TO THE ANTIPODES
AND THEN HE GAVE THEM AS FULLY AND EXACTLY AS HE COULD ALL THE LIGHTS EMITTED BY DR BUDDLE AND ENDEAVOURED TO GIVE HIS NARRATIVE AS CHEERFUL AND CONFIDENT AN AIR AS HE COULD
HIS FURY WAS EXCITED TO A PITCH THAT WAS VERY NEARLY UNGOVERNABLE
I CAN'T QUITE DESCRIBE TO YOU THE ODD AND UNPLEASANT SORT OF SURPRISE WHICH THAT VERY GENTLEMANLIKE FIGURE STANDING AMONG THE BRANDON HOUSEHOLD GODS AT THIS MOMENT COMMUNICATED TO ME
BLACK EYES--BLACK HAIR--RATHER ON A LARGE SCALE BUT CERTAINLY HANDSOME
SHALL I GET SOME WATER FROM YOUR ROOM NO STANLEY
SO DOLLY DESPATCHED THE MESSENGER WITH A LANTERN AND THUS IT WAS THERE CAME A KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF REDMAN'S FARM AT THAT UNSEASONABLE HOUR
BUT SHE WAS RELIEVED
BUT SHE WAS RELIEVED
WHEN RACHEL HEARD THE CLANG OF HOOFS AND THE RATTLE OF THE TAX-CART DRIVING DOWN THE MILL-ROAD AT A PACE SO UNUSUAL A VAGUE AUGURY OF EVIL SMOTE HER
CAPTAIN LAKE HAVING GIVEN ORDERS THE EVENING BEFORE THAT ANYONE WHO MIGHT CALL IN THE MORNING AND ASK TO SEE HIM SHOULD BE SHOWN UP TO HIS BED-ROOM SANS CEREMONIE WAS ROUSED FROM DEEP SLUMBER AT A QUARTER PAST TEN BY A KNOCK AT HIS DOOR AND A WAITER'S VOICE
HE THINKS IT'S ALL FROM HIS STOMACH AND HE'S FEVERISH
THEY EXPECTED THEIR CLIENT THE PURCHASER IN A DAY OR TWO
ONE OF HIS MANIACAL TEMPERS WHICH HAD OFTEN BEFORE THROWN HIM AS IT WERE OFF THE RAILS WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS IMMEDIATE TROUBLES
THE GOOD ATTORNEY DREW UP AND STARED AT THIS GRAY PHANTASM SAYING TO HIMSELF YES IN A SORT OF QUIET HISS
I DON'T MEAN HE EVER WAS PLUCKED
I HAVE NEVER HAD BUT ONE TRANSACTION WITH THEM
BUT THERE ARE WAYS OF GETTING MONEY BY MORTGAGES AND LOANS AND PAYING THEM OFF WITHOUT LOSING THE PROPERTY I'VE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE OBJECTION TO RAISING MONEY IN THAT WAY
BUT FEW WOULD HAVE GUESSED HER AGONY AS SHE PLEADED WITH THE VICAR AND HIS WIFE
BUT HE HAD NONE--FOR HE WALKED BY THE BRANDON ARMS AND HALTED AND STARED AT THE POST-OFFICE AS IF HE FANCIED HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY THERE
BUT THE RESULT IS THAT PARTLY ON TECHNICAL AND PARTLY ON OTHER GROUNDS I CONTINUE OF THE CLEAR OPINION THAT THE IDEA IS ABSOLUTELY IMPRACTICABLE AND MUST BE PEREMPTORILY LAID ASIDE IN ATTEMPTING TO ARRIVE AT AN ESTIMATE OF ANY RESOURCES WHICH YOU MAY BE CONSCIOUS OF COMMANDING
GOOD-NIGHT TAMAR
THE SILVER LIGHT OF HEAVEN FADED FROM HIS LONG FACE A DEEP SHADOW OF EARTH CAME THEREON AND HIS SMALL DOVE-LIKE EYES GREW INTENSE HUNGRY AND RAT-LIKE
BUT IT LEFT HIM A DEVILISH HARD HEAD I TOLD HIM AND I THINK IT SHARPENS HIS WITS I RATHER THINK YOU'LL FIND HIM A USEFUL MAN
BUT THAT WAS NOT RACHEL'S WAY
AND ON ARRIVING AT DUXLEY WAS QUITE SURPRISED TO FIND LADY DULHAMPTON AND HER DAUGHTERS THERE UPON A SIMILAR QUEST
POOR MARK WILL YOU BE SO GOOD SIR AS TO TOUCH THE BELL SAID LAKE CHANGING HIS TONE
HA HA HA LARKIN WAS NOT EASILY PUT OUT BUT HE WAS DISCONCERTED NOW
IT WAS NOT IN ANY DEFINED WAY--I DID NOT FANCY THAT HE WAS MACHINATING FOR INSTANCE ANY SORT OF MISCHIEF IN THE BUSINESS BEFORE US--BUT I HAD A NOTION THAT HE WAS NOT QUITE WHAT HE PRETENDED
I AM AFRAID CAPTAIN LAKE DABBLED A LITTLE IN OPIUM
IN INFLUENCE AND WHAT IS TERMED POSITION IT WAS OF COURSE WORTH A GREAT DEAL MORE
AND WITH OTHER THINGS AT HIS BACK AN ABLE MAN LIKE HIM MIGHT BEFORE LONG LOOK AS HIGH AS SHE
I'VE ALWAYS HEARD IT COST MY UNCLE AND SIR WILLIAM CAMDEN FIFTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS YES IT WILL BE EXPENSIVE WEALDON THINKS--_VERY THIS TIME
SHE LIKED TO LISTEN
WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT STANLEY HE LOOKED UP WITH A GENTLE START LIKE ONE RECOVERING FROM A REVERIE AND SAID WITH HIS YELLOW EYES FIXED FOR A MOMENT ON HIS SISTER BEFORE THEY DROPPED AGAIN TO THE CARPET
BUT IT WAS REVERENT AND DISTINCT AND I HAVE HEARD WORSE EVEN IN THE READING DESK
I OWN SAID LORD CHELFORD LAUGHING THAT FROM PREJUDICE I SUPPOSE I AM IN FAVOUR OF THE APOSTOLIC METHOD AND STAND UP FOR THE DIVINE RIGHT OF MY SEX
LARKIN WITH A GLOW OF SATISFACTION TOOK ONE OF THESE NOBLE CIGARS AND ROLLED IT IN HIS FINGERS AND SMELT IT
SINCE HE GOT A LITTLE WATER HE'S QUITE QUIET POOR FELLOW
IT SEEMED TO ME HOWEVER THAT THE DISTANCE HAD POSITIVELY INCREASED SINCE YESTERDAY AND THAT THE OFTENER SHE MET ME THE MORE STRANGE SHE BECAME
A POCKET-BOOK WITH SOME ENTRIES NEARLY EFFACED
HER MISTRESS DID NOT SPEAK
HOW LONG IS ALL THIS TO GO ON FOR MASTER STANLEY WHY D YOU TAMAR CAN'T YOU LISTEN HE SAID CLUTCHING HER WRIST IN HIS LAVENDER KID GRASP RATHER ROUGHLY
AND I DO THINK IF PEOPLE HAD NO RESERVES THEY WOULD BE VERY UNINTERESTING HE ADDED
BESIDES WHY ON EARTH SHOULD EITHER SHOW HIMSELF IN THAT ABSURD WAY
AND THEY WERE NOT LESS BEAUTIFUL FOR BEING SOMETHING MORE THAN PICTURES AND STATUES
A ROTTEN HOUSE--DOWN WITH IT--BLOW IT UP--THREE VOTES ONLY--BUT AS GOOD AS THREE HUNDRED FOR THE PURPOSE--OF THE THREE HUNDRED GRANT BUT THREE YOU KNOW--OF COURSE THEY DON'T THINK OF RESIGNING OH DEAR NO--AN IMMEDIATE DISSOLUTION
THOMAS SLEDDON OF WADDING HALL--AT THIS MOMENT IN THE BRANDON ARMS"--IS JUST THE MAN
HOW D'YE DO MRS DUTTON
STILL RACHEL LAKE FANCIED THAT SHE DETECTED SIGNS NOT ONLY OF TOLERANCE BUT OF POSITIVE LIKING IN HER HAUGHTY COUSIN'S DEMEANOUR AND WONDERED AFTER ALL WHETHER DORCAS WAS BEGINNING TO LIKE SIR HARRY BRACTON
DON'T THEY OFTEN AFFECT INDIFFERENCE AND OCCASIONALLY EVEN AVERSION WHERE THERE IS A DIFFERENT SORT OF FEELING
LARKIN DELIVERED THIS WITH STERN FEATURES AND EMPHASIS THE CAPTAIN'S COUNTENANCE UNDERWENT SUCH A CHANGE AS CONVINCED THE ATTORNEY THAT SOME INDESCRIBABLE EVIL HAD BEFALLEN MARK WYLDER AND THAT CAPTAIN BRANDON LAKE HAD A GUILTY KNOWLEDGE THEREOF
THERE WAS A SILENCE OF SOME SECONDS AND HIS YELLOW FERINE GAZE MET HERS STRANGELY
EH WELL IT CERTAINLY WAS A CURIOUS ACCIDENT
HE HAD QUITE TIME TO MAKE HIS VISIT AND SAVE THE DOWN-TRAIN AFTER
WHAT ON EARTH CAN IT BE JOS
YOU KNOW ME TOO WELL
YOU'RE BETTER NOW
IT IS NOT PRETTY REPEATED THE OLD LADY
I AM VERY CERTAIN STANLEY THAT IF THIS SUPPOSED PREFERENCE LEADS YOU TO ABANDON YOUR WILD PURSUIT OF DORCAS IT WILL PREVENT MORE RUIN THAN PERHAPS EITHER OF US ANTICIPATES
NO HOPE--NO POSSIBILITY OF A PHYSICAL REASCENSION THIS TIME
HE HAD NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO PERFORM CAVALIER SEUL WITH HIS SLICE OF MUTTON--A SENSUAL SORT OF ISOLATION WHILE ALL THE WORLD WAS CHATTING SO AGREEABLY AND NOISILY AROUND HIM
SO WITH RAPID STRIDES PASSING THE DIM GABLES OF REDMAN'S FARM HE AT LENGTH FOUND HIMSELF WITH A SENSE OF INDESCRIBABLE RELIEF UPON THE GYLINGDEN ROAD AND COULD SEE THE TWINKLING LIGHTS IN THE WINDOWS OF THE MAIN STREET
WELL CAPTAIN
WHEN JOS
IT WAS I THINK ABOUT FIFTEEN POUNDS--BOOKS--I AM ASHAMED TO SAY HOW LONG AGO
WHEN DID YOU COME AND SO ON--LAKE ANSWERING AND LOOKING WONDERFULLY AS USUAL
SHE TOO WAS A DREAM AND I DARE SAY HER MONEY SPENT BY THIS TIME
CAN I DO ANYTHING CAPTAIN LAKE FOR YOU WHILE IN TOWN NOTHING ON EARTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
I TOLD HIM HOWEVER THAT I HAD DREAMED DREAMS AND WAS RESTLESS AND UNCOMFORTABLE IN MY PRESENT BERTH AND BEGGED HIS INTEREST WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER TO HAVE MY QUARTERS CHANGED TO THE LOWER STOREY--QUITE RESOLVED TO REMOVE TO THE BRANDON ARMS RATHER THAN ENCOUNTER ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT AS I HAD PASSED
D YOU--ARE YOU THERE SHOUTED THE CAPTAIN VERY ANGRY
AND I WAS SAID TO HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF HIS TALENT
WISE OLD TAMAR HAD TURNED THE KEY UPON THE SLEEPING GIRL
HE'LL SOON BE BACK IN TOWN OR TO BRIGHTON I SAID
HE SEES THE THING HIMSELF NOW
IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT HE HAD MADE ANOTHER GREAT ADVANCE HAD THROWN AWAY HIS CRUTCH HANDLED STICK AND RECOVERED FLESH AND VIGOUR
ANYTHING RATHER THAN THAT DEGRADATION--THAN THAT VILLAINY
AND NOW THE ANCIENT GRAY CHAPEL WITH ITS STAINED WINDOW AND STORE OF OLD BRANDON AND WYLDER MONUMENTS AMONG ITS SOLEMN CLUMP OF ELM-TREES FLITTED BY ON MY RIGHT
HE IS COMING AND SURE ENOUGH HERE HE WAS QUITE UNEXPECTED NEXT MORNING AND WAS THERE NO MORE ASKED MISS LAKE
WELL THE NEXT POSSIBLY I HOPE I NEVER DO THAT SAID THE APATHETIC BEAUTY SERENELY
HE'S A PUSHING FELLOW ONE OF THE COOLEST HANDS I KNOW
WITH THE NEED FOR ACTION THE POWER OF ACTION IS GONE
NOW LOOK AT THESE PERSIAN LETTERS ON THE INSIDE FOR THAT'S THE ODDEST THING ABOUT IT
I SUPPOSE THE BALANCE OF ATTRACTION AND REPULSION WAS OVERCOME BY MISS LAKE MUCH AS HE DISLIKED STANLEY FOR WYLDER FOLLOWED THEM OUT WITH LORD CHELFORD TO HELP THE YOUNG LADY INTO HER CLOAK AND GOLOSHES AND I FOUND MYSELF NEAR MISS BRANDON FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT EVENING AND MUCH TO MY SURPRISE SHE WAS FIRST TO SPEAK AND THAT RATHER STRANGELY
BUT HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE PROSPECT
IF HE DECLINED HIS ADVICE THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE SAID BUT TO BOW HIS HEAD TO THE STORM AND THAT PONDEROUS EXECUTION WOULD DESCEND IN WRECK AND DESOLATION
SHE WAS UP AND DRESSED AND THIS MOMENT COMING DOWN AND WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE MISS BRANDON IF SHE WOULD STEP INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM
SHE PAUSED AS HE SPOKE AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT LITTLE GARDEN DOOR
THEY SHOOK HANDS
LARKIN KNEW THE NEXT MOMENT HE HAD TALKED NONSENSE
AND AS QUICKLY AS MIGHT BE THE TRUSTWORTHY MAN WITH HIS LATCH-KEY IN HIS POCKET SOFTLY OPENED THE PORTAL THROUGH WHICH THE OBJECT OF HIS ANXIETY HAD JUST EMERGED CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND STOOD LISTENING INTENTLY IN THE RECESS OF THE ENTRANCE WHERE HE HEARD THE NOW MORE CARELESS STEP OF THE CAPTAIN TREADING AS HE THOUGHT THE BROAD YEW-WALK WHICH TURNS AT A RIGHT ANGLE AT THE FOOT OF THE TERRACE STEP
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE UNACCOUNTABLE PROCEEDING ON THE PART OF STANLEY LAKE AND A MORE ROMANTIC SITUATION IF RACHEL AND HIS LORDSHIP HAD NOT HAD BEFORE TWO OR THREE LITTLE ACCIDENTAL RAMBLES TOGETHER IN THE GROUNDS AND GARDENS OF BRANDON
THE GULES AND GOLD WERE REFLECTED ON THE YOUNG MAN'S HEAD AND WITH A VAIN AUGURY THE ATTORNEY READ AGAIN THE SOLEMN WORDS FROM HOLY WRIT PRINCEPS INDUETUR MAERORE THE GOLDEN GLARE RESTED LIKE A GLORY ON HIS HEAD
TELL HIM YOU DESIRE NO BETTER AND WILL BRING IT AT ONCE BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE
SO TAMAR WITHDREW TO PREPARE TEA
OTHERS AGAIN SUPPOSED HE MIGHT BE THAT MAJOR CRADDOCK WHO HAD LOST THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS ON VANDERDECKEN THE OTHER DAY
I HOPE SHE WILL
ALLOW ME TO SPEAK A WORD CAPTAIN LAKE YOU D--D OLD MISCREANT REPEATED THE CANDESCENT CAPTAIN
IT IS TOO SERIOUS A STEP TO BE TAKEN IN HASTE THERE HAS BEEN NO HASTE RACHEL AND THERE CAN BE NO CHANGE AND WHAT REASON CAN YOU GIVE NONE
I WAS AS MUCH SURPRISED AS ANY FOR A FEW SECONDS
AND TO PREVENT THAT RISK THE UTMOST PROMPTITUDE WAS INDISPENSABLE
BUT HE WENT ON THE CONTRARY RATHER QUIETLY THREATENING TO PAY ME OFF HOWEVER THOUGH HE DID NOT SAY HOW
ALLOW ME TO SAY YOU MISAPPREHEND YOU INFERNAL OLD CUR I MEAN NO IMPUTATION UPON YOU SIR
WELL MRS SMITHERS SAID HE ENCOURAGINGLY HIS LONG FEET ON THE FENDER FOR THE EVENING WAS SHARP AND MRS S
SHE HAD SMILED AT IT AS SUCH WHEN DORCAS USED TO HINT AT IT
DEBATE AND INTERRUPTION
AND THE FEW WHO HAD SEEN IT ALL DID NOT CLEARLY COMPREHEND IT--ONLY IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THE ROW HAD ORIGINATED IN JEALOUSY ABOUT MISS JONES THE PRETTY APPRENTICE WHO WAS JUDICIOUSLY WITHDRAWN FORTHWITH BY MRS PAGE THE PROPEREST OF CONFECTIONERS
ON THE WHOLE HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SORRY FOR THE DELAY
I DON'T LIKE IT BUT IT IS TOO LATE NOW
I DO NOT KNOW STANLEY WHAT YOUR FEELINGS MAY BE
SO THEY CROSSED THE STILE AND STILL CONVERSING FOLLOWED THE FOOTPATH UNDER THE HEDGEROW OF THE PRETTY FIELD AND CROSSING ANOTHER STILE ENTERED THE PARK
YOU USED NOT I'VE HEARD TO BE ALWAYS SO SCRUPULOUS OLD TAMAR THERE WAS A VILE SARCASM IN HIS TONE AND LOOK
HERE WAS LIGHT BUT IT GLARED AND FLASHED IN VAIN FOR HIM
ANY ANSWER REQUIRED NO SIR PLEASE--ONLY TO LEAVE IT AND MISS LAKE IS QUITE WELL NO SIR PLEASE--A BAD HEADACHE TO-DAY OH
THE CAPTAIN WAS NOT SORRY FOR IN TRUTH HE WAS IN RATHER IMMINENT JEOPARDY JUST THEN
SHE COULD ONLY CLOSE HER EYES AND WRING HER HANDS
HIS FINGERS ONCE SO BUSY LAY MOTIONLESS ON THE COVERLET AND HIS TIRED EYES RESTED ON THE TOYS WITH A JOYLESS EARNEST APATHY
WELL TAMAR HOW DO YOU DO?--HOW ARE ALL
HE TOOK A COURSE I DID NOT EXPECT
D IT
MY BOOK--EXCEPT WHEN I WAS THINKING OF THE TARN AND THAT OLD MAN I SO HATED--WAS MISS BRANDON'S EXQUISITE AND MYSTERIOUS FACE
YOU'VE BEEN VERY KIND RADIE
HA HA SAYS THE GENTLEMAN WITH A GENTLE LITTLE LAUGH I SUPPOSE SHE'S AS FRIGHTFUL AS EVER THAT WORTHY WOMAN
HOW COULD HE HAVE OVERLOOKED THAT
YES DEAR SHE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO SAY MORE BUT HE REMAINED SILENT AND SHE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO SPEAK AND ALSO THAT SHE HAD THAT TO SAY WHICH MUST BE SAID
THERE WAS REPROACH BUT LOVE TOO IN THE DEEP SOFT GLANCE SHE THREW UPON HIM
THERE WAS NO RETREAT
I SHALL HOWEVER TURN IT OVER IN MY MIND DON'T THE LEAST MIND ME
IF THERE BE ANY HANGING BACK OR APPEARANCE OF IT IT MAY CALL DOWN UNPLEASANT--INDEED TO BE QUITE FRANK RUINOUS--CONSEQUENCES WHICH I THINK IN THE INTEREST OF YOUR FAMILY YOU WOULD HARDLY BE JUSTIFIED IN INVOKING UPON THE MERE SPECULATION OF YOUR RESPECTED BROTHER'S DEATH THERE WAS A SOUND OF VOICES AT THE DOOR
AND HOW DO YOU DO--QUITE WELL JIM--AND OUT OF PLACE
THANK YOU FROM MY HEART FOR YOUR LOVE
HE HAD A GROWING BELIEF THAT LAKE AND PERHAPS HE ONLY_--EXCEPT WYLDER HIMSELF--KNEW THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MYSTERIOUS MARCHING AND COUNTER-MARCHING
AND HE WAS A GOOD JUDGE
BUT YOU CAN'T READ IT WITHOUT LIGHT SAID RACHEL
HOPE THE LIFE OF ACTION WAS GONE
RACHEL LAKE HAD SPOKEN LAST AND IT WAS THE CAPTAIN'S TURN TO SPEAK NEXT
WILLIAM WYLDER HAS PRESSING OCCASION FOR SOME MONEY AND I CAN'T LEAVE HIM ABSOLUTELY IN THE HANDS OF BURLINGTON AND SMITH NO OF COURSE--QUITE SO SAID LAKE WITH THAT SLY SMILE WHICH MADE EVERY FELLOW ON WHOM IT LIGHTED SOMEHOW FANCY THAT THE CAPTAIN HAD DIVINED HIS SECRET
IT IS AN OFFICE OF GREAT RESPONSIBILITY AND I FOR ONE WILL NOT CONSENT TO TOUCH IT ON ANY OTHER CONDITIONS THAN THOSE I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY TO MENTION THESE ARE EASILY COMPLIED WITH--IN FACT I UNDERTAKE TO SHOW YOU THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN DISTURBED ANSWERED LAKE RATHER SULLENLY
LET ME WHISPER YOU NO NOT JUST AT THIS MOMENT PLEASE SAID LAKE DRAWING AWAY DISGUSTED FROM THE MANIACAL LEER AND TITTER OF THE GIGANTIC OLD MAN
SIMPLY THAT HE THOROUGHLY LIKES YOU AND ENJOYS HIMSELF
DO YOU PLAY OH
LARKIN PROFOUNDLY
THE MAJOR FUSSED INTO THE HOUSE AND SAW AND TALKED WITH LARCOM WHO WAS SOLEMN AND BLAND UPON THE SUBJECT AND WENT OUT FIRST TO MAKE PERSONAL INSPECTION OF THE CAPTAIN WHO SEEMED TO HIM TO BE DYING
BUT IF A STONE THE GENTLE SCENE DIVIDE SWIFT RUFFLING CIRCLES CURL ON EVERY SIDE AND GLIMMERING FRAGMENTS OF A BROKEN SUN BANKS TREES AND SKIES IN THICK DISORDER RUN BUT AS I SAID IT IS NOT A DOUBT THAT AGITATES YOUR MIND--THAT IS WELL REPRESENTED BY THE STONE THAT SUBSIDES AND LEAVES THE POOL CLEAR IT MAYBE BUT STAGNANT AS BEFORE
HE WILL BLAST HIMSELF AND DISGRACE ALL CONNECTED WITH HIM
WHO IS TO ADVISE YOU IF NOT YOUR HUSBAND
I LITTLE THOUGHT YOU HAD ANY SUCH MATTER TO SPEAK--AND YOU SPOKE SO SUDDEN LIKE I COULD NOT HELP IT
THOUGH 100_L
SO STUPID SO HE SHOOK HANDS WITH OLD TAMAR AND PATTED HER AFFECTIONATELY ON THE SHOULDER AND HE SAID KEEP THE HALL-DOOR BOLTED
BUT HE HAD BEEN VIOLENTLY AGITATED AND THE TRACES OF HIS FURY COULD NOT DISAPPEAR IN A MOMENT
AT THAT MOMENT THERE MIGHT BE A WHOLE ROSARY OF SONS SMALL AND GREAT TO INTERCEPT THE INHERITANCE
AND PUT ON THAT DAMNED AFFECTED LOOK OF HORROR
THOUGH RACHEL WAS UNFIT FOR LETTER-WRITING SHE WAS STILL MORE UNFIT FOR SLUMBER
CHAPTER XXXIX
MEANWHILE IN THE BLACKBERRY DELL DOCTOR BUDDLE WAS ASSISTING AT A DIFFERENT SORT OF INQUISITION
WE WERE NEVER GOOD FRIENDS MARK AND I
I DO ASSURE YOU UPON MY HONOUR I NEVER HEARD OF SO RIDICULOUS A BLUNDER
AND NOW WITH THIS FIVE OAKS TO BEGIN WITH--L1,400 A YEAR--A GREAT CAPABILITY IMMENSELY IMPROVABLE HE WOULD STAKE HALF HE'S WORTH ON MAKING IT MORE THAN L2,000 WITHIN FIVE YEARS
BUT WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPOSE ANY PLOT AGAINST OUR TITLE MARK WYLDER IS IN CONSTANT CORRESPONDENCE WITH THAT FELLOW LARKIN
IN ABOUT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS RACHEL LAKE ARRIVED IN THE CARRIAGE WHICH HAD BEEN DESPATCHED FOR HER WITH DORCAS'S NOTE
AND HER FINGERS MORALLY TINGLED TO BOX HIS EARS
AND THAT WE ONLY AWAITED HELP TO GET HIM DOWN TO REDMAN'S FARM
AND SO THE BRICK WALLS AND LAMPS BEGAN TO GLIDE BACKWARD AND THE TRAIN WAS OFF
WHEN WILLIAM WYLDER HEARD THE NEWS HE FAINTED
AY
SO THE VICAR VERY MUCH FLUSHED IN PANIC AND PERPLEXITY AND TRUSTING WILDLY TO HIS PROTESTING LAWYER'S GUIDANCE SUBMITTED
THE SAD EXPERIENCE OF MY PROFESSION HAS TAUGHT ME THAT A SUSPICIOUS MAN OF THE WORLD WITHOUT RELIGION MY DEAR MR WYLDER AND HE LIFTED HIS PINK EYES AND SHOOK HIS LONG HEAD AND LONG HANDS IN UNISON--'WITHOUT RELIGION--WILL IMAGINE ANYTHING
AND IT HAD EXCEEDED ALL I HEARD
THE HUNT BALL IS THE GREAT ANNUAL EVENT OF GYLINGDEN
AND WHEN I AM NOT HERE A DEVIL GOES UP AND DOWN IN THE ROOM
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT ASKED WYLDER A LITTLE SNAPPISHLY
BUT IT WAS NOW PLAIN TO ME THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE ON HIS MIND AND HE WAS THINKING OF THE SHABBY LETTER HE HAD JUST RECEIVED
HE WAS SHOT SOMEWHERE IN THE SHOULDER OR BREAST--THEY COULD NOT SEE EXACTLY WHERE NOR DISTURB HIM AS HE LAY
HIS DRESS WAS CONFOUNDEDLY DRAGGLED
HERE THE ROAD BEING BOTH STEEP AND RUGGED OUR SPEED ABATED
MORTAL HATRED SEEMS TO DEEPEN AND DILATE INTO SOMETHING DIABOLICAL IN THESE PERVERTED ANIMOSITIES
HIS MORALITY HOWEVER I SUPPOSE WAS QUITE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE WORLD AND HE HAD NEVER COMMITTED HIMSELF IN ANY OF THOSE WAYS OF WHICH THAT RESPECTABLE TRIBUNAL TAKES COGNIZANCE
I AM IN GREAT DISTRACTION OF MIND AND SHE HUGGED AND KISSED THE PALE LITTLE BOY SHE HERSELF PALER
THE FAT LITTLE DOCTOR RECEIVED HIM IN DRAWERS AND A VERY TIGHT WEB WORSTED SHIRT STANDING BY THE WINDOW AT WHICH DANGLED A SMALL LOOKING-GLASS
HE THOUGHT I AM SURE THAT A COMPETENT STAFF OF ANGELS WERE PLACED SPECIALLY IN CHARGE OF THE INTERESTS OF JOS
WHEN THE CRUTCHLEIGHS OF CLAY MANOR A GOOD OLD FORMAL FAMILY WERE MOUNTING THE STAIRS IN SOLEMN PROCESSION--THEY WERE ALWAYS AMONG THE EARLY ARRIVALS--THEY HEARD A PIANO AND A TENOR PERFORMING IN THE SUPPER-ROOM
BUT THE ATTORNEY SUSPECTED SOMETIMES--JUST FROM A FAINT PHRASE WHICH HAD ONCE ESCAPED STANLEY LAKE--AS THE LIKELIEST SOLUTION THAT MARK WYLDER HAD MADE A LEFT-HANDED MARRIAGE SOMEHOW AND SOMEWHERE AND THAT A SUBTERRANEAN WIFE AND FAMILY WOULD EMERGE AT AN UNLUCKY MOMENT AND SQUAT UPON THAT REMAINDER AND DEFY THE WORLD TO DISTURB THEM
HE WAS PROFOUNDLY INTERESTED
AND HE WAS THE SORT OF PERSON WHO IF THE FANCY WERE STRONG ENOUGH MIGHT MARRY IN HASTE AND REPENT--AND MAKE HIS WIFE TOO REPENT--AT LEISURE
BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD NO SORT OF PRINCIPLE AND A DESPERATELY STRONG HEAD
THEN LAKE GOT INTO HIS CAB AGAIN HAVING LEARNED THAT HE HAD LODGINGS IN ST JAMES'S STREET WHEN HE DID NOT STAY AT THE CLUB AND TO THESE HE DROVE
THERE WERE PLEASANT THEORIES ADAPTABLE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES
A LITTLE BIT SLOW EH HE WHISPERED AND LAUGHED AGAIN AND LOUNGED INTO THE HALL
I POKED UP MY FIRE AND LIGHTED MY CANDLE
CAPTAIN LAKE WAITING WITH HIS HAND ON THE DOOR-HANDLE FOR THE STROKE HEARD THE SMACK OF THE BALLS AND THE SCORE CALLED BY THE MARKER AND ENTERED THE HOT GLARING ROOM
ALL MY CONDUCT HAS BEEN AS OPEN AS THE LIGHT
IT WAS A TALISMAN IT SEEMS AND NO ONE WHO WORE IT COULD EVER BE LOST
HE WAS SUCH A DARLING PERHAPS THE VICAR WAS THINKING OF THE CHURCH-YARD AND HOW HE WOULD LIKE WHEN HIS TIME CAME TO LIE BESIDE THE GOLDEN-HAIRED LITTLE COMRADE OF HIS WALKS
LIKE A BIRD I COULD SING AND FLY ALMOST--A FOOLISH OLD THING--HA
AND HE EXPECTED TO SEE THE GLITTERING LIGHTS THAT PEEPED THROUGH THE DARK CHINK BETWEEN BRIM AND COLLAR SHUT UP UNDER ITS REBUKE
I AM SO DELIGHTED THAT YOU HAVE COME
I HAVE A LITTLE WINE AT REDMAN'S FARM
LAKE ADMITTED THAT RACHEL HAD POSTED THE LETTERS IN LONDON BELIEVING THEM TO BE GENUINE FOR HE PRETENDED THAT THEY WERE WYLDER'S
HIS LITTLE PINK EYES OPENED QUITE ROUND AND HIS LANK CHEEKS AND TALL FOREHEAD FLUSHED AT THE RUSH OF WILD IDEAS THAT WHIRRED ROUND HIM LIKE A COVEY OF BIRDS AT THE STARTLING SUGGESTION
HE ALSO KNEW THAT SHE WAS IMPETUOUS AND CLEVER AND HE FEARED FROM THAT SMALL WHITE HAND A FATAL MISCHIEF--HE COULD NOT TELL EXACTLY HOW--TO HIS PLANS
IT SAID WE HAVE MUCH PLEASURE IN STATING THAT THE SEVERE INJURY SUSTAINED FOUR DAYS SINCE BY CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE AT THE TIME A VISITOR AT THE LODGE THE PICTURESQUE RESIDENCE OF JOSIAH LARKIN ESQ IN THE VICINITY OF GYLINGDEN IS NOT LIKELY TO PROVE SO DIFFICULT OF TREATMENT OR SO IMMINENTLY DANGEROUS AS WAS AT FIRST APPREHENDED
BUT REALLY I DO NOT KNOW VERY WELL WHERE TO TURN OR WHOM TO SPEAK TO
LAKE AVERNUS SAID A HOLLOW VOICE BEHIND HIM AND A LONG GRISLY HAND WAS LAID ON HIS SHOULDER
HARDLY FIVE MINUTES REMAINED NOW
HE COULD ONLY LOOK AND MUTTER AFTER IT WILDLY
HE LOOKED BEFORE HIM WITH HIS EYEBROWS SCREWED IN A VAIN EFFORT TO PIERCE THE DARKNESS AND THE SAME BEHIND HIM
YOU KNOW THE STATE I'M IN--SLEEPLESS--HALF WILD--ALL ALONE HERE
THERE WAS SOMETHING EVERY WAY VERY SERIOUS IN THE AFFAIR
SO REASSURING IS THE FAMILIAR SPECTACLE OF LIFE EVEN IN ITS SUBSIDENCE SO LONG AS BODILY TORTURE AND MENTAL ABERRATION ARE ABSENT
I MAKE A VERY GOOD SORT OF A NUN AND A CAPITAL HOUSEMAID
AND AS THEY CHATTED IN THIS STRAIN RACHEL PAUSED ON A SUDDEN WITH UPRAISED HAND LISTENING PLEASANTLY
QUITE WELL I HOPE
ONE'S JUDGMENT MATURES AND WE ARE HARDER TO PLEASE--DON'T YOU THINK SO?--AS WE GROW OLDER AYE SO WE ARE I DARE SAY
SHE QUAILED FOR A MINUTE IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS GIGANTIC DEPRAVITY AND CRUELTY
I BOUND YOU EVEN BY A PROMISE TO TAKE IT BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT ENDED
THERE WAS NO INTIMACY OR CONFIDENCE BETWEEN US
DO I THINK IT MAY SAFELY BE CONTRACTED SOLELY TO JOIN TWO ESTATES REPEATED THE OLD LADY WITH A LOOK AND CARRIAGE THAT PLAINLY SHOWED HOW ENTIRELY SHE APPRECIATED THE AMAZING PRESUMPTION OF HER INTERROGATRIX
I'LL COME TO-MORROW AND TELL YOU EXACTLY--MAYBE TO-MORROW EVENING--WILL THAT DO
OH DOCTOR MY LITTLE FAIRY THE DOCTOR KNEW SOMETHING OF THE POOR VICAR'S TROUBLES--OF COURSE IN A VILLAGE MOST THINGS OF THE KIND ARE KNOWN--AND OFTEN IN HIS BRISK ROUGH WAY HE THOUGHT AS WITH A NOD AND A WORD HE PASSED THE LANK CLERIC UNDER THE TREES OR ACROSS THE COMMON WITH HIS BRIGHT PRATTLING SUNNY-HAIRED LITTLE BOY BY THE HAND--OR ENCOUNTERED THEM TELLING STORIES ON THE STILE NEAR THE CASTLE MEADOW--WHAT A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE WAS ALWAYS DANCING ABOUT HIS PATH IN THAT SMILING WAYWARD LOVING LITTLE FELLOW--AND NOW A LONG ICELANDIC WINTER WAS COMING AND HIS PATH WAS TO KNOW THAT LIGHT NO MORE
ONE DOES NOT REALLY UNTIL ONE HAS VISITED IT TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER AT ALL COMPREHEND ITS WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE
AND AFTER THE TRENCHANT AND RAPID VIVISECTION WHAT SINISTER SCARS AND SEAMS REMAIN AND HOW GAUNT AND REPULSIVE OLD ACQUAINTANCES STAND UP FROM IT
OH WILLIE OUR PRECIOUS TREASURE--OUR ONLY ONE AND SO THEY WALKED UP AND DOWN THAT ROOM HIS ARM ROUND HER WAIST AND IN THAT SORROWFUL EMBRACE MURMURING AMID THEIR SOBS TO ONE ANOTHER THEIR THOUGHTS AND REMEMBRANCES OF LITTLE MAN HOW SOON THE TREASURE GROWS A RETROSPECT
WHY DOES HE WAIT FOR YOU THERE
MY VERY HAIR WAS DRIPPING WITH A COLD MOISTURE
AND OF COURSE THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY
HE HAD THE SAME BLACK CURLY HAIR AND THICK BLACK WHISKERS
HE HAS HAD A GREAT TOUR TO MAKE
THEY HAD NOT WALKED FAR WHEN LAKE SUDDENLY SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ALL THIS RADIE--THIS PARTICULAR VERSION I MEAN OF MARRIAGE A-LA-MODE THEY ARE PREPARING UP THERE AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CANE TOWARDS BRANDON HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER
GOOD-NIGHT TAMAR TAMAR STOOD FOR A MOMENT WITH HER ODD WEIRD LOOK UPON HER AND THEN BIDDING HER GOOD-NIGHT GLIDED STIFFLY AWAY SHUTTING THE DOOR
I DON'T THINK YOUR BIBLE TEACHES YOU ANYWHERE TO HURT YOUR NEIGHBOUR AND TO BREAK FAITH DON'T SPEAK OF THE BIBLE NOW
SO WISHING THEM THE GOOD-NIGHT THEY MERITED HE RE-ENTERED HIS CAB AND DROVE RAPIDLY BACK AGAIN TOWARDS THE WEST-END
IS MRS DUTTON AT HOME THE OLD LADY WHO WAS A LAUNDRESS ENTERED IN A SHORT BLUE COTTON WRAPPER WIPING THE SUDS FROM HER SHRUNKEN BUT SINEWY ARMS WITH HER APRON AND ON SEEING THE CAPTAIN HER COUNTENANCE WHICH WAS THREATENING BECAME VERY REVERENTIAL INDEED
YOU MUST QUIETLY STOP THAT MIND
RACHEL SAID NOTHING BUT HER EYES RESTED ON THE FLOOR AND WITH THE QUIET OBEDIENCE OF HER EARLY CHILDHOOD SHE DID AS TAMAR SAID
I'LL PITCH YOU OUT OF THE WINDOW I--I SAY LET GO
NOT A MESSAGE SIR
THEY'LL WANT TO KEEP IT OPEN FOR A BID FROM THE OTHER SIDE
HIS ANGLING HAD BEEN PROSPEROUS HITHERTO BUT JUST NOW HE HAD MADE A MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT AND HIS NETS AND HIS HEART WERE BURSTING
IS THAT YOU LAKE?--BEG PARDON
I DEFY HIM UTTERLY
THEN COULD ONLY GO UPON THE POINT THAT IT WAS KNOWN TO LAKE AT THE PERIOD OF THE SALE THAT MARK WYLDER WAS DEAD
IT IS NOT A THING TO BE PASSED OVER MURMURED THE ATTORNEY WHO HAD COME TO A DECISION AS TO THE FIRST STEP TO BE TAKEN AND HE THOUGHT WITH A QUALM OF THE EFFECT OF ONE OF WYLDER'S CONFIDENTIAL NOTES GETTING INTO CAPTAIN LAKE'S HANDS
YES--SIGNAL--STOP HIM CAN YOU THE PORTER ONLY SCRATCHED HIS HEAD UNDER HIS CAP AND SMILED SHEEPISHLY AFTER THE TRAIN
HE HAD GROWN TO DREAD THE ATTORNEY SINCE THE ARRIVAL OF DUTTON'S LETTER
BUT MY HANDS ARE SO AWFULLY FULL AND HE LIFTED THEM UP AND SHOOK THEM AND SHOOK HIS TALL BALD HEAD AT THE SAME TIME AND SMILED A WEARY SMILE
HERE IT IS SAID THE CAPTAIN
SOMEHOW THE RACKING OFF OF THIS BITTER VINTAGE FROM ONE VESSEL INTO ANOTHER DID NOT SEEM TO IMPROVE ITS QUALITY
HE'S ABOUT THE GREATEST LIAR I THINK I EVER MET WITH AND HE LAUGHED ANGRILY
BELLA MA STUPIDA!--I EXPERIENCED AT LAST THE SORT OF PIQUE WITH WHICH GEORGE SAND'S HERO APOSTROPHISES LA DERNIERE ALDINI
NOT MUCH TIN I'M AFRAID NO NOT MUCH TIN ANSWERED LAKE
WHY STANLEY THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE GONE TO NAUNTON OH
WELL WE HAD BETTER WAIT
CHAPTER XIII
AND GO WE MUST FOR IT IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE OF ESCAPE
YOU HAVE ENTERTAINED THE PROJECT OF PURCHASING THE REVEREND WILLIAM WYLDER'S REVERSION
I THINK IT WAS LAWYER LARKIN'S PRIVATE CANON IN HIS DEALINGS WITH MEN THAT EVERYTHING WAS MORAL THAT WAS NOT CONTRARY TO AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT
AND NOBODY HAS EVER DONE IT WHO HAS NOT REGRETTED THAT HE DID NOT SELL INSTEAD I WON'T SELL FIVE OAKS STANLEY SAID THE YOUNG LADY SERIOUSLY
I OPENED MY BIBLE LORD HELP ME THREE TIMES TO-DAY MASTER STANLEY AND COULD NOT GO ON
AND I AM SORRY TO SAY I DON'T THINK HE HEARD MUCH OF WHAT I WAS SAYING FOR HE SUDDENLY CAME OUT WITH AND WHERE IS STANLEY LAKE NOW DO YOU KNOW I SAW HIM IN TOWN--ONLY FOR A MOMENT THOUGH--ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AGO
HE HAS HIS RETIRING ADDRESS WRITTEN
NO DARLING
I REALLY BELIEVE--AND AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME I MAY USE STRONG LANGUAGE IN A HISTORICAL SENSE--THAT CAPTAIN LAKE WAS THE GREATEST LIAR I EVER ENCOUNTERED WITH
I'VE SOMETIMES THOUGHT YOU WERE SIMPLY AN IMPOSTOR AND SOMETIMES SIMPLY THE DUPE OF YOUR OWN SORCERIES
AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHAT BUSINESS YOU HAD LISTENING AT THE KEYHOLE TO YOUR MISTRESS AND ME NOR WHY I AM WASTING MY TIME TALKING TO AN OLD WOMAN ABOUT MY AFFAIRS WHICH SHE CAN NEITHER UNDERSTAND NOR TAKE PART IN MASTER STANLEY IT WON'T DO
HE SUPPOSED SHE LIKE DORCAS FANCIED HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT WYLDER
FOR RICHER FOR POORER YOU'RE MY OWN--YOUR WAPSIE'S LITTLE MAN AND HE LIFTED HIM UP AND CARRIED HIM IN HIS ARMS AGAINST HIS LOVING HEART AND THE WATER STOOD IN HIS EYES AS HE LAUGHED FONDLY INTO THAT PRETTY FACE
THE GALLANT CAPTAIN HER BROTHER WAS ALSO ABSENT
HE WAS UNDER DOCTOR BUDDLE'S PORCH AND MADE A FLIMSY RATTLE WITH HIS THIN BRASS KNOCKER
O LET JOS
TRUE SAID THE VICAR YOUR MIND IS DISTURBED BUT NOT BY DOUBT
WAPSIE DON'T LET HIM
IT WAS SAD TO BE SURE THE LITTLE MAN SO MANY DAYS IN HIS BED TOO LANGUID TO CARE FOR TOY OR STORY QUITE SILENT EXCEPT WHEN IN THE NIGHT TIME THOSE WEIRD MONOLOGUES BEGAN WHICH SHOWED THAT THE FEVER HAD REACHED HIS BRAIN
I WILL BE RELEASED SIR FROM YOUR PRESENCE REALLY THIS IS VERY FINE RADIE CONSIDERING HOW WE ARE RELATED
AND NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE STANLEY I THINK I'LL MAKE YOU CARRY IT OUT TO THE LOBBY FOR ME I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO TOUCH IT DEAR RADIE
AND THIS HE LEFT WITH THE HALL-PORTER TO GIVE HIM SHOULD HE CALL
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF LARKIN ASKED WYLDER WITH A SLY GLANCE FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES
ALWAYS DOES WHEN HE CAN
ALL ON A SUDDEN DORCAS BRANDON SAID AND PRAY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MARRIAGE LADY CHELFORD WHAT DO I THINK OF MARRIAGE REPEATED THE DOWAGER THROWING BACK HER HEAD AND EYEING THE BEAUTIFUL HEIRESS THROUGH HER GOLD SPECTACLES WITH A STONY SURPRISE FOR SHE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE CATECHISED BY YOUNG PEOPLE
MARK WYLDER WAS VERY SHREWD AND WOULD NOT HAVE RUN HIMSELF INTO A FIX ANSWERED LAKE
AND BESIDES WRITING NOW AT A DISTANCE AND IN THE SPIRIT OF HISTORY I SUSPECT THE INTEREST WHICH BEAUTY ALWAYS EXCITES HAD A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH MY RESOLVE TO HOLD MY GROUND
AND WHEN SHE HAD DONE HE LAUGHED
AN EVIL SPIRIT INCARNATE HE SEEMED TO HER
FOR AFTER A SHORT PAUSE LEAVING THESE STILL UPON THE GROUND HE TURNED AND WALKED SLOWLY LIKE A POLICEMAN ON HIS BEAT TOWARD BRANDON
IT'S NOTHING I BELIEVE WHERE IS HE
TO BRING THE MATTER BEFORE THE COMMITTEE WERE UTTER RUIN TO MARK AND THEY LET HIM OFF ON THESE CONDITIONS--HE WAS TO RETIRE FORTHWITH FROM THE CLUB
ON COMING OUT UPON THE DOOR-STEPS WE ALL GREW SILENT
IT WILL TAKE PLACE SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE TWENTY-FOURTH OF NEXT MONTH
GRUMBLE
I AIR NO RELIGIOUS PRIG PUFFING MYSELF AND TRUSTING TO FORMS MAKING LONG PRAYERS IN THE MARKET-PLACE MARK'S QUOTATIONS WERE PARAPHRASTIC AND THINKING OF NOTHING BUT THE UPPERMOST SEATS IN THE SYNAGOGUE AND BROAD BORDERS AND THE PRAISE OF MEN--HANG THEM I HATE THOSE FELLOWS SO MARK LIKE OTHER MEN WE MEET WITH WAS PROUD OF BEING A PUBLICAN
AND IF HE PERSISTS JUST YOU PUT AN ADVERTISEMENT IN GALIGNANI SAYING MR SMITH WILL TAKE NOTICE THAT THE OTHER PARTY IS DESIROUS TO PURCHASE AND BECOMING VERY PRESSING
MY DARLING YOU WALKED TOO FAST HERE
I DON'T SEE IT SAID HE WITH ANOTHER SHAKE OF THAT LONG HEAD
YES STANLEY I CONJURE YOU TO TELL IT ALL THE COLD LIPS WITH A LIVID HALO ROUND THEM MURMURED THANK YOU IT WAS A SNEER VERY SHOCKING JUST THEN PERHAPS
BUT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY DEAD
IN THE RUDE AND SHALLOW GRAVE IN WHICH HE LAY HIS PURSE WAS FOUND AND SOME LOOSE SILVER MIXED IN THE MOULD
YOU'LL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO ENQUIRE WHETHER THERE WILL BE DANCING TO-NIGHT
AND IF I FAIL THROUGH YOUR UNKINDNESS HERE HE SWORE AN IMPIOUS OATH I'LL END ALL WITH A PISTOL AND LEAVE A LETTER TO CHELFORD DISCLOSING EVERYTHING CONCERNING YOU AND ME AND MARK WYLDER I THINK RACHEL LAKE WAS AS NEAR FAINTING AS EVER LADY WAS WITHOUT ACTUALLY SWOONING
DON'T BE THINKING ABOUT MASTER STANLEY
HE WAS ONE OF OUR FAMILY DEVILS HE WAS
BUT DETERMINED TO BRAVE ALL SHE WENT DOWN TO SEE DOLLY AND THE VICAR AT HOME
THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF RAPINE AND DUPLICITY HAD FALLEN THROUGH WITH A DISMAL CRASH
AND I SUPPOSE CAPTAIN LAKE YOU RECEIVED MY NOTE YOU MEAN JUST NOW
I HAVE SUCH A TREASURE OF AN OLD NURSE--POOR OLD TAMAR--WHO TELLS ME STORIES AND READS TO ME AND LISTENS TO MY FOLLIES AND TEMPER AND SOMETIMES SAYS VERY WISE THINGS TOO
YOU'RE WORTH CULTIVATING NOW YOU KNOW WYLDER WAS LEANING ON HIS ELBOW WITH JUST THE TIP OF HIS THUMB TO HIS TEETH WITH A VICIOUS CHARACTER OF BITING IT WHICH WAS PECULIAR TO HIM WHEN ANYTHING VEXED HIM CONSIDERABLY AND GLANCING SHARPLY THIS WAY AND THAT YOU KNOW HE SAID SUDDENLY WE ARE A SORT OF COUSINS
RACHEL SIGHED PROFOUNDLY AND HER EYES LOOKED SADLY THROUGH HER BOUQUET ON THE FLOOR
WHEN WE WERE IN THE PERSIAN GULF NEAR SIX YEARS AGO I WAS IN COMMAND OF THE SHIP
AND DORCAS I DON'T DENY IT I AM AMAZED YOU TELL ME SUCH THINGS
MR LARKIN'S CIGAR-CASE WAS OPEN IN HIS HAND IN A MOMENT AND WITH SUCH A SMILE AS A GENTEEL PERFUMER OFFERS HIS WARES WITH HE PRESENTED IT TOWARD THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS BUILT UP IN THE STACK OF GARMENTS
LARKIN VERY SHARPLY FOR AN INSTANT OF--_SOME_BODY
TAMAR TO BE SURE--WHY OF COURSE I KNOW YOU
YOU'LL DO ALL YOU CAN
AND NOT A CREATURE SUSPECTS YOU HAVE BEEN FROM HOME
PERHAPS YOU WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO WRITE A LINE ACROSS IT STATING THE DATE OF YOUR HANDING IT TO ME I--OF COURSE--I CAN SEE NO OBJECTION
READER YOU HAVE LOOKED ON HANS HOLBEIN'S DANCE OF DEATH THAT GRIM PHANTASMAL PAGEANT SYMBOLIC AS A DREAM OF PHARAOH
BUT A LITTLE IN ADVANCE OF HIM WHERE THE COPSEWOOD CLOSED IN AGAIN JUST ABOVE THOSE STONE STEPS WHICH LAKE AND HIS SISTER RACHEL HAD MOUNTED TOGETHER UPON THE NIGHT OF THE MEMORABLE RENDEZVOUS HE FANCIED THAT HE AGAIN SAW THE GRAY FIGURE COWERING AMONG THE FOREMOST STEMS OF THE WOOD
ON THE CONTRARY SOMETHING FIERCE AND LURID WHICH I THOUGHT WONDERFULLY BECOMING
GOOD-BYE MISS BRANDON AND CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE THAT PALE APPARITION WAS GONE
THE QUIETUDE OF THE GENTLEMAN IN THE FAR CORNER WAS QUITE SINGULAR
SO MY MEAL ENDED WE WENT INTO THE TAPESTRY ROOM WHERE THE NIGHT BEING SHARP A PLEASANT BIT OF FIRE BURNED IN THE GRATE AND WEALDON GREETED ME
AND THE INTEREST OF THE MONEY IS BETTER TO ME THAN MY PAY
THERE I'M NOT ANGRY--ONLY YOU'RE A FOOL
AND LIGHTING OUR CANDLES AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WE SCALED THAT LONG ASCENT TOGETHER AND HE CONDUCTED ME THROUGH THE INTRICACIES OF THE DEVIOUS LOBBIES UP STAIRS TO MY CHAMBER-DOOR WHERE HE BID ME GOOD-NIGHT SHOOK HANDS AND DESCENDED TO HIS OWN QUARTERS
THE PEOPLE--HANG IT!--YOU'LL HAVE ALL THE PEOPLE ABOUT YOU
NOT ALWAYS SICK
SO I DID
BE LIVELY
IN THE MEANTIME I WISH TO MAKE IT QUITE CLEAR WHAT I MEAN
NEITHER IN TRUTH DID I
WELL YOU SEE I'M HERE RADIE SOMEHOW HE WAS NOT VERY WELL PLEASED TO SEE HER
SHE WAS ALONE WITH STANLEY WITH A BEATING HEART AND A KIND OF CHILL STEALING OVER HER BY HER BROTHER'S BED
THE GOOD VICAR IS A GREAT TERRITORIAL MAGNATE NOW
THAT SORT OF THING WON'T ANSWER ME
IT IS QUITE UNDERSTOOD
BUT WHAT WAS I SAYING?--OH YES--MARK YOU KNOW--IT WAS VERY KIND BUT HE HAS SO MANY THINGS ON HIS MIND IT QUITE ESCAPED HIM--AND HE KEEPS YOU KNOW WANDERING ABOUT ON THE CONTINENT AND NEVER GIVES HIS ADDRESS
IT IS NO SMALL THING THROUGH SO MANY CENTURIES TO HAVE RETAINED YOUR ANCESTRAL ESTATES AND YOUR PRE-EMINENT POSITION AND EVEN THIS SPLENDID RESIDENCE OF SO MANY GENERATIONS OF YOUR LINEAGE I THOUGHT THAT MISS BRANDON HAVING BROKEN THE ICE WAS HENCEFORTH TO BE A CONVERSABLE YOUNG LADY
HE TOLD ME NOTHING
LARKIN COULD NOT TELL WHICH WAY IT HAD GONE
THE NEXT GENERATION OR TWO WOULD AMUSE THEMSELVES WITH A LAWSUIT UNTIL THE OLD BRANDON TYPE REAPPEARED IN SOME BACHELOR BROTHER OR UNCLE WITH A JEZEBEL ON HIS LEFT HAND AND AN ATTORNEY ON HIS RIGHT AND PRESTO
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE BODY WERE SOON ESTABLISHED
I SHOWED IT TO PLATTEN AND FOYLE
IF HE HAD HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN REMINDED AS HE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE WILD FIELD OF TACTICS JUST NOTED BY HIS PEN OF THAT GLOBE SIMILARLY STARRED ALL OVER WITH LITTLE RED CROSSES WHICH M
AND UNLESS YOU MAKE ME THE PROMISE I REQUIRE I WILL TAKE BEFORE EVENING SUCH MEASURES AS WILL COMPLETELY EXCULPATE ME
IT IS REALLY AS I SAY INEXPLICABLE FOR MR MARK WYLDER MUST THOROUGHLY SEE ALL THIS
IT DOES LOOK AS IF THE DIVISION WAS NEARER THAN THEY PRETEND JUST SO
BUT HE IS HAPPY TO OBSERVE AT ALL EVENTS THAT END HOW HE MAY THE GENTLEMAN BEGINS WITH A LARK WHICH SIR J.H
EVER SINCE I HAVE LIVED IN TERROR AND WORSE IN DEGRADATION
IN THE QUEER LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM OF REDMAN'S FARM IT WAS TWILIGHT SO DENSE WERE THE SHADOWS FROM THE GREAT OLD CHESTNUTS THAT SURROUNDED IT BEFORE THE SUN WAS WELL BENEATH THE HORIZON
ITS SOLEMN AND UNIVERSAL IMPORTANCE IN GYLINGDEN AND THE COUNTRY ROUND GAVE ME I FANCIED SOME NOTION OF WHAT THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD MUST HAVE BEEN TO THE HEBREWS AND JERUSALEM
YOU SEE HOW I'M PLACED
HIS GALL ROSE AND THAT DISTANT TALK RANG IN HIS EARS LIKE A COOL BUT INTANGIBLE INSULT
SO I SUPPOSED
CLERGYMAN AND MAGICIAN BOTH AND THE CHIEF OF THE LYING PROPHETS WITH THICK LIPS
OH POOR STANLEY
BUT I KNOW YOU'LL HOLD THE TILLER TILL I GET THROUGH
THE CUR WILL BEGIN TO TRY FOR THE COUNTY OR FOR DOLLINGTON
DOES HE REALLY THINK THAT STANLEY WILL RECOVER SAID RACHEL
NONSENSE LITTLE MAN CRIED HIS FATHER WITH QUICK REPROOF ON HEARING THIS SACRILEGIOUS UPROAR
BUT MY DOING SO NOW UNFORTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE I SHALL HAVE IN A VERY FEW DAYS WOULD BE ATTENDED WITH A DANGER WHICH YOU WILL THEN UNDERSTAND
CHAPTER LXX
THE SWEET CHAPEL BELL WAS JUST CEASING TO TOLL AS MR JOS
NOW REALLY THIS EVENING IS QUITE CELESTIAL I'VE JUST BEEN LISTENING TO A GOOD MAN'S CONVERSATION AND I WISH TO REFLECT UPON IT SAID RACHEL VERY COLDLY
THE POOR VICAR
YOU NEED NOT TALK OF THIS
HE SUSPECTED THAT HIS JOURNEY TO LONDON HAD FOR ITS OBJECT A MEETING WITH THAT PERSON
THE ATTORNEY WAS IN A POSITION TO LECTURE THE REV
PERHAPS IT WAS THIS SMELL OF CARRION FROM WHICH HORSES SOMETIMES RECOIL WITH A SPECIAL TERROR THAT CAUSED THE SWERVING AND REARING WHICH HAD ENDED SO FATALLY
WOULD YOU LET HIM WHIP ME IF I WAS NAUGHTY
HE DID NOT MOVE BUT HIS STRANGE EYES GAZED COLD AND EARNEST FROM THEIR DEEP SOCKETS UPON HER FACE IN AWFUL SILENCE
IT WAS A SORT OF BOUDOIR OR DRESSING-ROOM WITH A FEW PRETTY OLD PORTRAITS AND MINIATURES AND A NUMBER OF LOUIS QUATORZE LOOKING-GLASSES HUNG ROUND AND SUCH PRETTY QUAINT CABRIOLE GILT AND PALE GREEN FURNITURE
BUT HIS TALL FIGURE ROSE UP AND HE EXTENDED THE FINGERS OF HIS LEFT HAND CLOSE TO THE CANDLE FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN HELD THEM UP TO HIS EYES GAZING ON HIS FINGER-TIPS WITH A HORRIFIED SORT OF SCRUTINY AS IF HE SAW SIGNS AND PORTENTS GATHERED THERE LIKE THOMAS AQUINAS ANGELS AT THE NEEDLES POINTS AND THEN THE SAME CADAVEROUS GRIN BROKE OUT OVER HIS FEATURES
IT IS NECESSARY TO TELL YOU
A NEW PRESENT FROM MARK WYLDER THOUGHT LADY CHELFORD AS THESE OBJECTS MET HER KEEN GLANCE
IT IS MOST UNLIKELY WE SHOULD EVER GET A FARTHING OF IT ANY OTHER WAY AND IT WILL GIVE US ENOUGH TO MAKE US QUITE HAPPY BUT MY DARLING DON'T YOU KNOW THE REVERSION UNDER THE WILL IS A GREAT FORTUNE
THIS PLACE IS DREADFUL AND ITS DARKNESS DREADFUL
THE DOGS WERE BARKING AT IT
PERMIT ME TO ASSIST YOU TO SOME HONEY YOU'LL FIND IT REMARKABLY GOOD I VENTURE TO SAY
IT BEHOVES HIM
I'M GLAD DARLING I UNDERSTAND YOU NOW
AND LITTLE MARGERY ACTIVELY BROUGHT THE TEA-CADDY
NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
I LIT A BIT OF FIRE IN YOUR ROOM MISS
AND MR LARKIN DISAPPOINTED LEFT A NOTE TO STATE THAT IN WRITING THAT MORNING AS HE HAD DONE IN REFERENCE TO THE PURCHASE OF THE REVERSION THROUGH MESSRS
THE FEATURES ARE TRUE
HE STOPPED--HE LISTENED--HE STARED SUSPICIOUSLY INTO THE PROFOUND DARKNESS
YOU DO RADIE AND WHY DO YOU DISSEMBLE WITH ME I DON'T DISSEMBLE
AND IF YOU WANT TO ENGAGE THEM NOW YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE DOUBLE WHAT THEY GOT LAST TIME BUT LAKE WAS NOT TO BE DAUNTED
IN WHICH MY SLUMBER IS DISTURBED
I ASSURE YOU DORCAS I HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY FRANK
I HAVE JUST HEARD FROM CAMBRIDGE AND FIND THAT MY GOOD FRIEND MR MOUNTAIN THE BOOKSELLER HAS BEEN DEAD TWO MONTHS AND HIS WIFE--HE WAS A WIDOWER WHEN I KNEW HIM BUT IT WOULD SEEM HAS MARRIED SINCE--IS HIS SOLE EXECUTRIX AND HAS SOLD THE BUSINESS AND DIRECTED TWO GENTLEMEN--ATTORNEYS--TO CALL IN ALL THE DEBTS DUE TO HIM--PEREMPTORILY--AND THEY SAY I MUST PAY BEFORE THE 15TH
BUT I'M CERTAIN YOU WILL MEET NO ONE
I SAID HE SHOULD GO ABROAD AND SO HE SHALL SAID LAKE IN A VERY LOW TONE WITH A GRIM OATH
WELL HEAVEN HELP US ALL SO SHE STOOD IN THE SAME SAD ATTITUDE LOOKING OUT UPON THE SHADOWY SCENE IN A FORLORN REVERIE
AND THOUGH AS RESPECTED MARK WYLDER THEY WERE GRISLY THE ATTORNEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SORRY TO BE QUITE SURE THAT THEY WERE SOUND
HOW CAN DORCAS ENDURE THAT MAN THOUGHT RACHEL AS SHE SAW SIR HARRY LEAD HER TO HER SEAT AFTER A SECOND DANCE
AND FEW WHO DID SO CAME OFF ALTOGETHER SCATHLESS
MAYBE HE IS IN SOME MAD DOCTOR'S HOUSE AND NOT MAD
IN THE DRAWING-ROOM HE WATCHED MISS LAKE OVER HIS CUP OF COFFEE AND AFTER A FEW WORDS TO HIS FIANCEE HE LOUNGED TOWARD THE TABLE AT WHICH SHE WAS TURNING OVER SOME PRINTS
AND THEY DROPPED RACHEL AT HER LITTLE DWELLING
THIS CRY OF MARK WAS BEGINNING TO CONNECT ITSELF UNCOMFORTABLY IN HIS MIND WITH HIS SPECULATIONS ABOUT HIS WEALTHY CLIENT WHICH IN THAT SOLITUDE AND DARKNESS BEGAN TO SEEM NOT SO ENTIRELY PURE AND DISINTERESTED AS HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF REGARDING THEM AND A SORT OF WOOD-DEMON SUCH AS A QUEER LITTLE SCHOOLFELLOW USED LONG AGO TO READ A TALE ABOUT IN AN OLD GERMAN STORY-BOOK WAS NOW DOGGING HIS DARKSOME STEPS AND HANGING UPON HIS FLANK WITH A VINDICTIVE DESIGN
BE COURAGEOUS THEN STANLEY
HO AND MR LARKIN LIFTED UP HIS PINK EYES AND LONG HANDS AND SHOOK HIS LONG HEAD WITH A MELANCHOLY SMILE AND A SIGH LIKE A SHUDDER
POOH
POOH
I HAD A LONG YARN FROM THE VISCOUNT--ADVICE AND THAT SORT OF THING
THERE ARE QUITE OTHER PERSONS AND I CAN'T ALLOW THEM TO STARVE SO SAYING HE ROSE WITH HIS PECULIAR SMILE AND EXTENDED HIS HAND TO SIGNIFY THAT THE CONFERENCE WAS AT AN END
I MUST TALK TO SOME ONE
SHE HAS FINE EYES--AND I THINK NO OTHER GOOD POINT--MUCH TOO DARK FOR MY TASTE--BUT THEY SAY CLEVER AND NOT ANOTHER WORD WAS THERE ON THIS SUBJECT
MR PAGE HAD NOW COMPLETED HIS PROGRAMME AND WARNED BY THE DISRESPECTFUL VIOLINS FROM THE GALLERY OF THE BALL-ROOM WHENCE A CONSIDERABLE CATERWAULING WAS ALREADY ANNOUNCING THE APPROACH OF THE DANCE HE MADE HIS FAREWELL FLOURISH AND BOW AND SMILING WITHDREW
HE FANCIES YOU KNOW HE'S A PROPHET
AND WITH THESE FINE QUALITIES AND A MUCH SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAYS OF THE FLASH WORLD HAD COMMANDED MY BOYISH REVERENCE AND A GENERAL POPULARITY AMONG STRANGERS
THE ATTORNEY WITHDREW THE LITTLE PRIVATE ENCLOSURE AND SLIPT IT WITH A BRIEF ENDORSEMENT INTO THE NEAT SHEAF OF WYLDER'S LETTERS ALL SIMILARLY NOTED AND SO LOCKED IT UP IN THE IRON SAFE
CHAPTER X
JUST AT THE DARKEST POINT OF THE ROAD A LITTLE ABOVE THE RUDE COLUMN WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED LAKE'S HORSE A YOUNG ONE SHIED STOPPED SHORT RECOILING ON ITS HAUNCHES AND SNORTED FIERCELY INTO THE AIR
IT WAS A LONG VISIT
BUT I'VE LOST THAT--YES--I LET HIM UNDERSTAND I DID NOT CARE FOR IT AND SO THAT GOOD INFLUENCE IS GONE FROM ME--GRACELESS CREATURE
YOU SEE CAPTAIN LAKE TO SPEAK QUITE FRANKLY--THERE'S NOTHING LIKE BEING PERFECTLY FRANK AND OPEN--ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE NOT TREATED ME WITH CONFIDENCE WHICH OF COURSE WAS NOT CALLED FOR IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE--I MAY AS WELL SAY IN PASSING THAT I HAVE NO DOUBT ON MY MIND YOU KNOW A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN YOU CARE TO TELL ABOUT THE FATE OF MR MARK WYLDER
IT WAS EVIDENT HIS MIND WAS WORKING AND NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THE ROOM FOR A MINUTE BUT THE TAPPING OF HIS NAILS ON THE CHAIR LIKE A DEATH-WATCH
YOU WILL FIND ON CONSIDERATION THAT MISS LAKE WILL NOT PRESS HER RESIDENCE UPON YOU
IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HAD SPOKEN SOME THREE OR FOUR MINUTES THAT DORCAS SUDDENLY UTTERED A WILD SCREAM AND STARTED TO HER FEET
BUT AS YOU WISH IT I'LL CARRY MY FANGS ELSEWHERE;--AND WHAT HAS BECOME OF WILL WYLDER OH
I SEE DORCAS YOU ARE FRIGHTENED AND NERVOUS
YOURS MY DEAR LARKIN VERY TRULY MARK WYLDER FOLDED IN THIS WAS A THIN SLIP OF FOREIGN PAPER ON WHICH WERE TRACED THESE LINES PRIVATE DEAR LARKIN,--DON'T FUNK THE INTERVIEW WITH THE BEAST LAKE--A HYAENA HAS NO PLUCK IN HIM
A POACHER MAYBE
LARKIN WANTED TO GET A MAN'S PROPERTY A BARGAIN--AND HE HAD MADE TWO OR THREE EXCELLENT HITS THOUGH COMPARATIVELY ON A VERY SMALL SCALE--HE LIKED SO TO CONTRIVE MATTERS AS TO BRING HIS CLIENT TO HIS KNEES BEGGING HIM TO PURCHASE ON THE TERMS HE WISHED
WITHOUT REMOVING HIS GAZE HE WAS FUMBLING IN HIS POCKET FOR HIS NOTE-BOOK WHICH HE DISPLAYED WITH A FAINT SMILE GRIM AND PALLID
THE CHIMES FROM THE GYLINGDEN CHURCH-TOWER HAD PROCLAIMED THAT IN THE DISTANCE SOME MINUTES BEFORE
PERHAPS MR LARKIN HAD NOT YET FORMED ANY DISTINCT PLANS AND WAS REALLY IN CONSIDERABLE DUBITATION
AND MISS BRANDON HAD BEEN FROM THE FIRST SPECIALLY COLD AND REPELLENT TO CAPTAIN LAKE
AND WITHOUT FLATTERING AND WHEEDLING YOU'LL NEVER HAVE CONJUGAL OBEDIENCE
THAT YOUNG LADY WAS LEANING BACK IN HER GREAT OAK CHAIR IN WHICH SHE LOOKED LIKE THE HEROINE OF SOME SAD AND GORGEOUS ROMANCE OF THE OLD CIVIL WARS OF ENGLAND AND DIRECTING A GAZE OF CONTEMPLATIVE AND HAUGHTY CURIOSITY UPON THE OLD LADY WHO WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DARING PROFANATION
CHAPTER XXVII
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY WE SHOULD NOT LAKE SAID IN HIS PECULIAR TONES
HIS FEATURES PEAKED AND EARTHY AND THAT LOOK SO NEW AND PECULIAR WHICH DOES NOT SAVOUR OF LIFE UPON THEM
I DARE SAY HE'S THE KIND OF FELLOW YOU'D LIKE VERY WELL RADIE AND HIS SLY EYES HAD A TWINKLE IN THEM WHICH SEEMED TO SAY PERHAPS I'VE DIVINED YOUR SECRET AND SO I DO AND I LIKE HIS WIFE TOO VERY MUCH HIS WIFE
AND THAT HE HAD THE HONOUR OF BEING PRESENTED TO MARK--SAINT OR SINNER AS HE MAY BE--ON THE GROUND BY HIS SIR J.H.'S FRIEND CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE OF THE GUARDS HERE WAS AN ASTOUNDING FACT
HANG IT
THE LITTLE ADVENTURE AND THE DEEPENING SHADES HELPED TO SADDEN MY HOMEWARD WALK
NOW THERE CAME FROM MESSRS
HE WOULD REPEAT HIS HYMN WITH HIM AND PRAY--AND SO HE WENT UP THE NURSERY STAIRS
I DARE SAY IT BRINGS HIM IN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED A YEAR EH AND WYLDER LAUGHED AGAIN
SHE HAS NO LIFE IN HER
BUT OH
BUT OH
AND THE CAPTING HE'S HOFFLE BAD-TEMPERED THIS MORNING AND HE NEVER LOOKED NEAR HER ONCE AFTER HIS SISTER CAME
AND BEING ALREADY OF A THOUGHTFUL OLD-BACHELOR TEMPERAMENT AND AVERSE FROM BURNING HOUSES I PLACED ONE OF MY TALL WAX-LIGHTS IN A BASIN ON THE TABLE BY MY BED--IN WHICH I SOON EFFECTED A LODGMENT AND LAY WITH A COMPARATIVE SENSE OF SECURITY
INCREDIBLE
THIS ELECTION FRIGHTENS ME RADIE--EVERYTHING FRIGHTENS ME NOW--BUT THIS IS SO AUDACIOUS
TAKE CARE YOUR WIT DON'T GET YOU INTO TROUBLE SAID THE BARONET CHUCKLING AND GROWING ANGRIER FOR HE SAW THE HEBE LAUGHING
I'M NO JUDGE BUT THE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTOOD IT SAID HE WAS VERY GOOD OH
TAMAR DEAR MASTER STANLEY'S HERE AND WISHES TO SEE YOU OH
BUT THAT WAS IN THE CLOUDS
AND IT WAS INCUMBENT ON GYLINGDEN TO MAKE HIS DEFEAT MEMORABLY DISGRACEFUL AND DISASTROUS
THANK HEAVEN
THE SECOND WAS WHETHER HE MR M.W WAS ACCOMPANIED AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE INSTRUMENT BY ANY FRIEND
I HOPE I DID NOT VEX YOU TAMAR
I HOPE--GOD HELP ME--I HAVE NOT DONE WRONG
AND THE FACT IS I DON'T THINK WE ARE SAFE UNTIL THAT SALE IS CONCLUDED DORCAS LOOKED FOR A MOMENT EARNESTLY IN HIS FACE AND THEN DOWN IN THOUGHT
YOUR KEYS ARE IN MY BASKET NO DARLING
BEWARE--I MAY ENTRENCH MYSELF IN THAT ISOLATION
AND THEN LOOKED FOR A WHILE FROM THE WINDOW UPON RECEDING HEDGEROWS AND FARMSTEADS AND THE LEVEL AND SPACIOUS LANDSCAPE
ELECTIONEERING SCHEMES ARE CONDUCTED PARTICULARLY AT THEIR INITIATION LIKE CONSPIRACIES--IN FACT THEY ARE CONSPIRACIES AND THEREFORE THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE IN THE INTENSE CAUTION WITH WHICH STANLEY LAKE SET ABOUT HIS
IS NOT ABLE TO READ WHICH OR WHAT
HE WOULD NOT DISTURB HER--NO LET HER ENJOY FOR AN HOUR MORE HER HAPPY ILLUSION
I WRITE TO CHELFORD TO SAY THE SAME THIS NOTE WAS AS UNCEREMONIOUS AND STILL SHORTER
IN THE AUTUMNAL SUN AMONG THE EMBROWNED AND THINNING FOLIAGE OF THE NOBLE TREES BRANDON HALL LOOKED SOLEMN SAD AND MAGNIFICENT AS USUAL WITH A SORT OF RETROSPECTIVE SERENITY BURIED IN OLD-WORLD GLORIES AND SORROWS AND HEEDING LITTLE THE FOLLIES AND SCANDALS OF THE HOUR
AND I WILL TELL YOU IN A LITTLE TIME EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
SO LARCOM CAME TO THE DOOR TO ANNOUNCE THE DOCTOR IN A WHISPER AND BUDDLE FUSSED INTO THE ROOM AND MADE HIS BOW TO LORD CHELFORD AND HIS BRIEF COMPLIMENTS AND CONDOLENCES
VERY PASSIONATE BUT HARDLY RESPECTABLE
YOU HAVE HEARD THEN FROM MR WYLDER MY DEAR DORCAS NO LADY CHELFORD SAID THE YOUNG LADY WITH A GRAVE SERENITY TURNING HER HEAD LEISURELY TOWARDS HER
DORCAS DARLING HE'LL DIE
IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO TELL WYLDER WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF HIM IT WOULD PERHAPS HAVE MADE HER MORE TOLERABLE THAN SHE WAS FOR SOME DAYS AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THAT LETTER TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY
WHY WHY WHY DID YOU EVER COME SHE THREW BACK HER PALE FACE BITING HER LIP AND EVEN IN THAT DEEPENING GLOOM HER SMALL PEARLY TEETH GLIMMERED WHITE
SHE MADE NO ANSWER AND HE REPEATED THE QUESTION
AND HE LIKES YOU--HE LOVES YOU
YES HE'S A STRANGE MIXTURE OF SUSPICION AND IMPRUDENCE
IN THIS THE SUBTLEST AND MOST PERILOUS OF ALL INTOXICATIONS IT NEEDS IMMENSE PRESENCE OF MIND TO CONDUCT OURSELVES ALWAYS WITH DECORUM
WHAT COULD BE THE MOTIVE FOR THIS ELABORATE AND HIDEOUS FRAUD
IT IS ALL A FRAUD--EVEN IF YOU HAVE SIGNED--ALL A FRAUD
OF COURSE YOU HAD THE SETTLEMENTS AND DEVIL'S IN IT IF YOU COULD NOT HAVE BEAT ABOUT A WHILE--IT WAS NOT SO QUICK WITH ME--AND NOT DOUBLED THE POINT IN A SINGLE TACK
YOU WILLIAM ARE A GENTLEMAN
HE PROPPED THE BODY AGAINST THE BANK AND TRIED TO STANCH THE BLEEDING
IT WAS THE DARK AND PALLID SCRUTINY OF A FAMILIAR OF THE HOLY OFFICE BRINGING A VICTIM BACK TO CONSCIOUSNESS
MR LARKIN NEVER HURT ANYONE
AND HE SHUT OUT THE WHOLE TRIBE OF LETTER-WRITERS BY SIMPLY OMITTING TO GIVE THEM HIS ADDRESS
SO SO SOMETHING NEW AND VERY ELEGANT AND PRETTY SAID THE OLD LADY ALOUD HOLDING HER HEAD HIGH AND LOOKING AS IF SHE WERE DISPOSED TO BE PROPITIATED
YES--ABOUT THE NAUNTON JUNCTION
DORCAS BRANDON PAYS RACHEL A VISIT
AND TO SAY TRUTH IT WAS PARTLY TO TRY YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH A QUESTION ON THAT VERY POINT THAT I CAME HERE AND NOT INDEED DOLLY DEAR FROM IMPERTINENT CURIOSITY BUT IN THE HOPE THAT MAYBE YOU MIGHT ALLOW ME TO BE OF SOME USE HOW WONDERFULLY GOOD YOU ARE
THE MOST CRUSHING INVECTIVE WAS--THANKS TO HIS ADROIT MYSTIFICATION--SIMPLY A SOLILOQUY
BUT THOUGH HE NEVER HINTED AT AN UNFAVOURABLE ESTIMATE OF THE CAPTAIN HIS INTIMACIES WITH HIM WERE A LITTLE RESERVED
YOU KNOW MY FEELING ABOUT THE NOTE I WROTE THIS MORNING A LITTLE--I WILL NOT SAY INCAUTIOUSLY BECAUSE WITH A CLIENT OF YOUR KNOWN CHARACTER AND HONOUR NO IDEA OF THE SORT CAN FIND PLACE--BUT I WILL SAY THOUGHTLESSLY
ONE BLOSSOM ONLY REMAINED UNTARNISHED AND DORCAS PLUCKED IT AND WITH IT IN HER FINGERS SHE RETURNED TO THE PORCH WHERE RACHEL REMAINED
HE GLANCED OVER HIS SHOULDER DOWN THE STEPS HE HAD JUST SCALED
OH TAMAR
I DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF YOU
I SUSPECT THAT GRAVE MR LARCOM HAD BEEN MAKING HIS OBSERVATIONS AND CONJECTURES THEREUPON
WHATEVER EMINENT QUALITIES MARK WYLDER MIGHT BE DEFICIENT IN THE ATTORNEY VERY WELL KNEW THAT CUNNING WAS NOT AMONG THE NUMBER
HIS HEART MISGAVE HIM
HE DID NOT CONDESCEND TO ASK THE VICAR WHETHER HE STILL ENTERTAINED MISS LAKE'S PROPOSAL
BUT ALTHOUGH AFTER THAT INTERVIEW I SHALL PERHAPS NEVER SEE HER MORE I SHALL YET BE HAPPIER AND I THINK RELIEVED FROM SUSPENSE AND THE TORMENTS OF MYSTERY
THERE WAS NO TRACE NOW OF HIS SLEEPY JEERING WAY
BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT
AND THE REAL POINT IS THE FATAL SLIP IN YOUR POOR UNCLE'S WILL WHICH MAKES IT SO HIGHLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU AND MARK SHOULD BE UNITED
BUT WHEN IT WAS OVER I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT THE SONG WAS ABOUT
OH NO
OH NO
OH NO
THEY SHOW THEIR BEST TO MEN THEIR WORST TO GOD
IT WAS ONLY PRUDENT
NOTHING CAN BE MORE FALSE
FROM ALL THIS THE READER MAY SUPPOSE THAT MR JOS
AS FROM HER LITTLE TABLE SHE LOOKED LISTLESSLY THROUGH THE WINDOW SHE SAW AGAINST THE FAINT GLOW OF THE MOONLIGHT THE FIGURE OF A MAN WHO SEIZED THE PALING AND VAULTED INTO THE FLOWER GARDEN AND WITH A FEW SWIFT STUMBLING STRIDES OVER THE FLOWER-BEDS REACHED THE WINDOW AND PLACING HIS PALE FACE CLOSE TO THE GLASS SHE SAW HIS EYES GLITTERING THROUGH IT
OLD LADY CHELFORD SAT IN AN ARM-CHAIR IN THE SUPPER-ROOM WHERE A CONSIDERABLE AUDIENCE WAS COLLECTED
BUT A WORLDLY JUDGE WILL SOMETIMES DISAPPOINT THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN SUITOR
BEFORE IT WAS OVER THE DOCTOR SHAVED THE UNSHORN SIDE AND THE MAJOR STILL IN THE ROOM COMPLETED HIS TOILET IN HOT HASTE
YOU MUST NOT LOSE AN HOUR IN GETTING YOUR COMMITTEE TOGETHER AND PRINTING YOUR ADDRESS WHO'S ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU'LL HAVE JENNINGS OF COURSE
THE OLD MARCHIONESS NEVER APPEARS TILL THREE O'CLOCK AND ONLY OUT IN THE CARRIAGE TWICE SINCE THEY CAME
WHEN HE SAW THAT LAKE WHO BIT HIS LIP DURING THE PERUSAL HAD COME TO THE END BY HIS GLANCING UP AGAIN AT THE DATE LARKIN MURMURED SOMETHING YOU SEE HAS GONE WRONG WITH HIM
AND ASKED THE WAITER WITH A GRAND SMILE AND RECOGNITION HOW HE DID
IT WAS THUS EXPRESSED RESPECTET SIR,--IN ACCORDENS WITH YOUR DISIER I AV TOOK MY PEN TO SAY A FUE WORDS
STANLEY KNEW IT VERY WELL AND WAS NOT STARTLED AS THE ATTORNEY WAS THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN HE SAW IT
COME BACK AT HALF-PAST ELEVEN AND I'LL SEE YOU AND BRING YOUR PAPERS
D YOU LET ME IN HE REPEATED DRUMMING INCESSANTLY ON THE GLASS
AND AS WE TURNED THE CORNER A GLANCE AT THE BRANDON ARMS HOW VERY SMALL AND LOW THAT PALATIAL HOSTELRY OF MY EARLIER RECOLLECTIONS HAD GROWN
SHE'S OF COURSE VERY MUCH TO BE PITIED AND YOU HAVE MY LEAVE TO PITY HER AS MUCH AS YOU PLEASE I DO PITY HER SAID RACHEL
I VENTURE TO SAY I SUFFER MORE THAN YOU
AND A GALE IS SUCH FUN--SUCH A ROMP
BUT WITH A WILD AND BITTER RAGE RINGING UNDER IT
AM I
BUT I MUST CATCH MR LARKIN BEFORE HE GOES OUT
BUT IT WOULD NOT DO
BUT IT WOULD NOT DO
BUT IT WOULD NOT DO
HIS WARDROBE STOOD THERE
MY POOR MOTHER WAS THE LAST
STANLEY I AM SURE COULD SAVE THEM
ALSO TRUE THAT I WENT TO LONDON
DO YOU THINK SAID HE THERE IS MUCH DANGER OF THAT
DOLLY RECEIVED HER IN A GLAD SORT OF FUSS
OTHER SORROWS BEAR HEALING ON THEIR WINGS;--THIS ONE IS THE PROMETHEAN VULTURE
YOU MUST NOT TOUCH THE BELL--LISTEN TO ME
LARKIN AND THE VICAR XXXIII.--THE LADIES OF GYLINGDEN HEATH XXXIV.--SIR JULIUS HOCKLEY'S LETTER XXXV.--THE HUNT BALL XXXVI.--THE BALL ROOM XXXVII.--THE SUPPER-ROOM XXXVIII.--AFTER THE BALL XXXIX.--IN WHICH MISS RACHEL LAKE COMES TO BRANDON AND DOCTOR BUDDLE CALLS AGAIN XL.--THE ATTORNEY'S ADVENTURES ON THE WAY HOME XLI.--IN WHICH SIR FRANCIS SEDDLEY MANIPULATES XLII.--A PARAGRAPH IN THE COUNTY PAPER XLIII.--AN EVIL EYE LOOKS ON THE VICAR XLIV.--IN WHICH OLD TAMAR LIFTS UP HER VOICE IN PROPHECY XLV.--DEEP AND SHALLOW XLVI.--DEBATE AND INTERRUPTION XLVII.--A THREATENING NOTICE XLVIII.--IN WHICH I GO TO BRANDON AND SEE AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE IN THE TAPESTRY ROOM XLIX.--LARCOM THE BUTLER VISITS THE ATTORNEY L.--NEW LIGHTS LI.--A FRACAS IN THE LIBRARY LII.--AN OLD FRIEND LOOKS INTO THE GARDEN AT REDMAN'S FARM LIII.--THE VICAR'S COMPLICATIONS WHICH LIVELY PEOPLE HAD BETTER NOT READ LIV.--BRANDON CHAPEL ON SUNDAY LV.--THE CAPTAIN AND THE ATTORNEY CONVERSE AMONG THE TOMBS LVI.--THE BRANDON
I AM HIS SISTER AND THOUGH HE HAS SHOWN LITTLE LOVE FOR ME I AM NOT WITHOUT AFFECTION--AND STRONG AFFECTION--FOR HIM
BUT I MAY MENTION THAT BURLINGTON AND SMITH HAVE WRITTEN VERY STERNLY
AND RACHEL SAID WELL DORCAS YOU PROMISE YOU SPEAK TRULY RACHEL YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO MY PROMISE
BUT TO-MORROW WILL BE TIME ENOUGH
SO THE ATTORNEY HAD NO NOTION OF ALLOWING THIS HIGHLY SATISFACTORY ARITHMETIC TO BE THROWN INTO CONFUSION BY THE FILLIP OF A SMALL GLOVED FINGER
I'M AFRAID MA'AM HE'S GONE SAID THE NURSE
AND NOW AS WHEN I HAD SEEN THE ILL-OMENED FORM OF UNCLE LORNE AMONG ITS SOLITUDES THE DESCENDING SUN SHONE ACROSS IT WITH A SADDENED GLORY TIPPING WITH GOLD THE BLADES OF GRASS AND THE BROWN ANTLERS OF THE DISTANT DEER
PAUL'S ELEVEN HAVE CHALLENGED THE GIPSIES SAID LAKE LANGUIDLY LIFTING HIS EYES FROM THE PAPER
THE CAPTAIN HAD SIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED MURMURING THAT FORMULA ABOUT HAND AND SEAL AND ACT AND DEED AND DORCAS GLIDED IN LIKE A GHOST AND MERELY WHISPERING AN ENQUIRY TO LAKE DID LIKEWISE THE CLERK DEFERENTIALLY PUTTING THE QUERY THIS IS YOUR HAND AND SEAL C AND JOS
IF FAMILY SQUABBLES WERE TO ARISE I HAD NO FANCY TO MIX IN THEM
ALL THAT WAS NOBLEST AND MOST BEAUTIFUL IS THERE IN A CHANGELESS AND CELESTIAL SHADOW
MINE HOST MIGHT HAVE TURNED A GOOD ROUND SUM ONLY BY SHOWING THE BODY WERE IT NOT THAT EDWARDS THE CHIEF POLICEMAN HAD THE KEYS OF THE COACH-HOUSE
AND DON'T FANCY DARLING I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT YOU SAID TO ME ABOUT DUTY--THOUGH I WOULD CALL IT DIFFERENTLY--ONLY I FEEL SO WILD I CAN THINK OF NOTHING CLEARLY YET
AND IF YOU FIND IT HALF AS HARD TO LEAVE IT AS I DO YOUR STAYING HERE IS QUITE ACCOUNTED FOR THIS LITTLE SPEECH ALSO RACHEL UNDERSTOOD QUITE WELL THOUGH SHE WENT ON AS IF SHE DID NOT
BUT THE SPIRITUAL TRIBULATION WHICH CAME AND WENT WAS PROBABLY CONNECTED WITH THE DREADFUL AND INCESSANT HORRORS OF HIS MONEY TROUBLE
I'D CHOOSE IT THYSELF ONLY I'M SUCH A BAD JUDGE
CAPTAIN LAKE WAS NOT SO LOW AND RATHER BETTER THAN THIS MORNING THE DOCTOR SAID
I'VE A GREAT OBJECTION TO SPEAK OF BUSINESS TO-DAY SAID MR LARKIN HOLILY
WAS THERE NOT A TIME--AND NO VERY DISTANT ONE--WHEN FUTURITY CAUSED YOU NO ANXIETY AND WHEN THE SUBJECT WHICH HAS GROWN SO INTERESTING WAS ALTOGETHER DISTASTEFUL TO YOU
WHAT A VARNISHED RASCAL--WHAT A MATCHLESS LIAR
ALL THIS POWER WILL I GIVE THEE SAID THE DEVIL AND THE GLORY OF THEM
DID HE TELL THE FAMILY AT BRANDON CERTAINLY NOT THAT I HEARD
THERE WAS SOMETHING NAIVE AND SPIRITUEL AND VERY TENDER IN HER FACE WHICH HE HAS NOT CAUGHT--PERHAPS IT COULD HARDLY BE FIXED IN COLOURS YES I ALWAYS HEARD HER EXPRESSION AND INTELLIGENCE WERE VERY BEAUTIFUL
HE ACTED INSTINCTIVELY ON THE THEORY THAT ANY GOOD THAT WAS TO BE GOT FROM HUMAN BEINGS WAS TO BE EXTRACTED FROM THEIR FEARS
THAT IS THE WAY YOU WOMEN RUN AWAY WITH THINGS
YOU ARE NOT TO REPEAT ONE SYLLABLE I SAY TO YOU TO YOUR MOTHER DO YOU MIND OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON LIVING
GLASS OF WATER--QUICK CHILD CRIED OLD TAMAR TO MARGERY
WHAT THE DEVIL CAN YOU HAVE BEEN DREAMING OF
YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LAKE SAID LORD CHELFORD ADDRESSING ME
SHE WAS CONSTANTLY HINTING SOMETHING OF THE KIND
HE WAS NEARER TO THE CLOUDS AND THEY LOOKED SMALLER
IT IS A FUNNY WAY FOR A GENTLEMAN AND HE'S A GENTLEMAN
BY THE SAME POST WENT UP TO THE SAME FIRM A PROPOSITION--AN AFTERTHOUGHT--SANCTIONED BY A SECOND MINIATURE CORRESPONDENCE WITH HIS CLIENT NOW SAILING BEFORE THE WIND TO GUARANTEE THEM AGAINST LOSS CONSEQUENT AGAINST STAYING THE EXECUTION IN THE SHERIFF'S HANDS FOR A FORTNIGHT WHICH IF THEY AGREED TO THEY WERE FURTHER REQUESTED TO SEND A DRAFT OF THE PROPOSED UNDERTAKING BY RETURN AT FOOT OF WHICH IN PENCIL HE WROTE N.B.--_YES THIS ARRANGEMENT NECESSITATED HIS PROVIDING HIMSELF WITH A GUARANTEE FROM THE VICAR
YOU HAVE GIVEN HIM TIME ENOUGH
IT WAS LATE IN THE NIGHT AS WE KNOW
IT IS DANGEROUS DON'T YOU SEE
BUT HE HAD NOT YET SEEN LEVERETT
YOU KNOW YOU FANCIED I WAS THINKING OF MARRYING I DON'T REMEMBER THAT I SAID SO BUT I THOUGHT IT
HE IS A CLEVER FELLOW NO DOUBT BUT HAS BEEN SOMETIMES OUT-WITTED BEFORE NOW
WE'LL GO DOWN NOW TAMAR AND IN THE SAME STEALTHY WAY WALKING LIGHTLY AND SLOWLY DOWN THE STAIRS THEY WENT AND STANLEY ENTERED THE KITCHEN
SOME PEOPLE ARE MIRACULOUSLY SHARP OF HEARING
AFTER THAT TERRA OBLIVIONIS
AND YOU HAVE THE CHART BY HEART CHARLIE I'M AFRAID YOU'LL FIND ME BY NO MEANS SO WELL UP NOW AS SIX YEARS AGO IN WYLDER AND BRANDON BUT SURELY YOU HAVE YOUR LAWYER MR LARKIN HAVEN'T YOU TO BE SURE--THAT'S EXACTLY IT--HE'S DORCAS'S AGENT
YOU ARE A WONDERFUL LASS RADIE THANK YOU DEAR AND WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS PLACE THE HAPPY VALLEY I CALL IT
I HAVE A REGARD FOR YOU DUTTON
BE RESOLUTE--WE ARE BOTH RUINED UNLESS WE GO
WELL HE WENT AWAY IN SUCH A HURRY THAT HE NEVER THOUGHT OF IT
HE HAD A PROFOUND DISTRUST OF CAPTAIN LAKE
IF SHE HAS ANY CLEAR IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT I DON'T SEE WHY SHE SHOULD NOT TELL YOU
SATISFACTORY I HOPE SAID LAKE AS BEFORE
THE ATTORNEY WAS STANDING DURING THIS SAMPLE OF LAKE'S PARLIAMENTARY RHETORIC A LITTLE FLUSHED FOR HE DID NOT KNOW THE MOMENT WHEN A BLUE FLICKER FROM THE RHETORICAL THUNDER-STORM MIGHT SPLINTER HIS OWN BALD HEAD AND FOR EVER END HIS CONNECTION WITH BRANDON
RACHEL LAKE STANDING BY THE PIANO TURNED OVER THE LEAVES OF THE VOLUME OF MOORE'S MELODIES FROM WHICH THE ARTIST IN BLACK WHISKERS AND WHITE WAISTCOAT HAD JUST ENTERTAINED HIS NOBLE PATRONESS AND HIS AUDIENCE
I HAVE FOUND OUT A THING CAPTAIN LAKE WHICH WILL NO DOUBT INTEREST YOU AS MUCH AS IT DOES ME
IN WHICH LAKE UNDER THE TREES OF BRANDON AND I IN MY CHAMBER SMOKE OUR NOCTURNAL CIGARS
QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
THESE MASSES OF SOLEMN AND DISCOLOURED VERDURE THE FAINT BUT SPLENDID LIGHTS AND LONG FILMY SHADOWS THE SLOPES AND HOLLOWS--MY EYES WANDERED OVER THEM ALL WITH THAT STRANGE SENSE OF UNREALITY AND THAT MINGLING OF SWEET AND BITTER FANCY WITH WHICH WE REVISIT A SCENE FAMILIAR IN VERY REMOTE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD AND WHICH HAS HAUNTED A LONG INTERVAL OF MATURITY AND ABSENCE LIKE A ROMANTIC REVERIE
I HATE COWARDICE AND DECEPTION EVEN IN MYSELF--I HATE PERFIDY--I HATE FRAUD SHE TAPPED A LITTLE EMPHASIS UPON THE FLOOR WITH HER WHITE SATIN SHOE AND HER EYES FLASHED WITH A DARK AND ANGRY MEANING AMONG THE CROWD AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AS IF FOR A SECOND OR TWO FOLLOWING AN OBJECT TO WHOM IN SOME WAY THE STATEMENT APPLIED
RACHEL LAKE SEES WONDERFUL THINGS BY MOONLIGHT FROM HER WINDOW
YOU HAVE SHOWN IT DARLING AND YOU MUST CEASE TO BLAME YOURSELF
AND THOUGH HE CONSTANTLY WROTE TO MR LARKIN--YOU HAVE NO IDEA MY DEAR MISS LAKE WHAT A BLESSED ANGEL THAT MAN IS--OH
YES DARLING I WAS--_VERY UNEASY
I ALWAYS THOUGHT WHEN IN HIS COMPANY OF OLD LORD HOLLAND'S SILK STOCKING WITH SOMETHING UNPLEASANT IN IT
A CAT MAY LOOK YOU KNOW CAN'T YOU TOUCH THE BELL SIR
EVERYTHING IS SO WONDERFUL AND AWFUL IN THE LIGHT THAT HAS COME THAT MORNING POOR WILLIAM WYLDER HAD RECEIVED A LETTER FROM JOS
HE MADE AN ENQUIRY OF THE GUARD WITH WHOM HE WAS ACQUAINTED ABOUT HIS COMPANION
THE WHITE CAP KERCHIEF AND DRAPERY COURTESIED TO HIM AS HE DREW NEAR AND THE DISMAL FACE CHANGED NOT
WHAT A FRIEND IS RAISED UP AND HE CLASPED AND WRUNG THE LONG HANDS OF THE ATTORNEY AND I REALLY THINK THERE WAS A LITTLE MOISTURE IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S PINK EYES FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
BUT WHO IN THIS WIDE-AWAKE WORLD WAS BETTER ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF THAN THE GALLANT CAPTAIN
I'M A BAD BREAKFASTER
THE GOOD VICAR HAD MARCHED OFF WITH THE MAJOR WHO WAS BY THIS TIME UNBUCKLING IN HIS LODGINGS
SHE NEVER TOOK THAT TROUBLE FOR FORM'S SAKE LIKE OTHER WOMEN
I DESPISE HIS MACHINATIONS
YOU REALLY CAN'T IMAGINE WHO ARE ALWAYS HERE HOW VERY INTENSELY A PERSON WHO HAS JUST ESCAPED FROM LONDON ENJOYS ALL THIS I DON'T THINK STANLEY SAID THE YOUNG LADY COLDLY AND LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HER AS SHE WALKED YOU EVER CARED FOR NATURAL SCENERY--OR LIKED THE COUNTRY--AND YET YOU ARE HERE
THE OLD WOMAN OPENED IT
AND AWAY THEY DROVE THROUGH THE QUIET TOWN OF GYLINGDEN TOGETHER AND THROUGH THE SHORT STREET ON THE RIGHT AND SO UPON THE STILL QUIETER COMMON
IT'S ONLY ME MASTER STANLEY--YOUR POOR OLD TAMAR
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THEIR CRIMES AND FOLLIES THOSE WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE US NEVER IMPAIRED THE BRANDON ESTATE
LARKIN'S MIND THAT THIS CERTAINLY WAS HE AND WITH A SULKY NOD TO THE POLICEMAN HE WALKED DARKLY DOWN TO THE VICAR'S HOUSE
SO SOON AS THE LETTER WHICH HAD SO SURPRISED AND INCENSED STANLEY LAKE WAS DESPATCHED AND BEYOND RECALL RACHEL WHO HAD BEEN INDESCRIBABLY AGITATED BEFORE GREW ALL AT ONCE CALM
I DON'T THINK I WAS EVER THERE YOU HORRID DUNCE!--IT'S A BOOK BUT A STUPID ONE--SO NO MATTER LAUGHED MISS RACHEL GIVING HIM A LITTLE SLAP ON THE SHOULDER WITH HER SLENDER FINGERS
HE BEGAN TO RAVE ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK
AND IN FACT NOT ONLY DID LORD CHELFORD ASSIST THE FAIR LADY CLOAKED AND HOODED INTO THE CARRIAGE BUT THE VICAR'S GOODHUMOURED LITTLE WIFE WAS HANDED IN ALSO THE GOOD VICAR LOOKING ON AND AS THE GAY GOOD-NIGHT AND LEAVE-TAKING TOOK PLACE BY THE DOOR-STEPS MARK DREW BACK LIKE A GUILTY THING IN SILENCE AND SHOWED NO SIGN BUT THE RED TOP OF HIS CIGAR GLOWING LIKE THE EYE OF A CYCLOPS IN THE DARK
A FORTNIGHT BEFORE I THINK DURING DOLLY'S JEALOUS FIT THIS MAGNIFICENT OFFER OF RACHEL'S WOULD NOTWITHSTANDING THE DREADFUL NECESSITIES OF THE CASE HAVE BEEN COLDLY RECEIVED BY THE POOR LITTLE WOMAN
BUT FOREWARNED
IT WAS GOOD OF YOU TO COME RACHEL SAID MISS BRANDON
OLD MAJOR JACKSON HEARD OF IT IN HIS EARLY WALK AT BUDDLE'S DOOR
YOU THINK HE'LL DIE SAID THE VICAR STARING AT HIM
AND LAKE TURNED ROUND UPON ME A LITTLE ABRUPTLY HIS ODD YELLOWISH EYES A LITTLE LIKE THOSE OF THE SEA-EAGLE AND THE GHOST OF HIS SMILE THAT FLICKERED ON HIS SINGULARLY PALE FACE WITH A STERN AND INSIDIOUS LOOK CONFRONTED ME
HE REALLY ENJOYED HIS THREE LITTLE COURSES--HIS PINT OF CLARET HIS CUP OF CAFE NOIR AND HIS CHASSE THE GREAT BABYLON WAS HIS JERUSALEM AND HIS SPIRIT FOUND REST THERE
SHE HAD NO ONE TO CONSULT WITH
AND THEN CAME ONE OF THOSE WILD SCENES WHICH CLOSE SUCH TRAGEDIES--PAROXYSMS OF DESPAIR AND FRANTIC LOVE OVER THAT WORTHLESS YOUNG MAN WHO LAY DEAD BELOW STAIRS
PRAYERS WELL THEN IF YOU PERMIT ME BEING A LITTLE TIRED I'LL GO TO MY BED-ROOM WITH A GRAVE AND AFFECTIONATE INTEREST MR LARKIN LOOKED IN HIS FACE AND SIGHED A LITTLE AND SAID MIGHT I PERHAPS VENTURE TO BEG JUST THIS ONE NIGHT THAT CHASTENED AND ENTREATING LOOK IT WAS HARD TO RESIST
BUT STANLEY LAKE WAS SO DEEP--SUCH A MASK--IN HIM IT MEANT NOTHING
BUT HE SEEMED TO KNOW INTUITIVELY THAT LARKIN INTENDED TELLING HIM APROPOS OF THE STATION THAT STORY OF THE HADDON PROPERTY AND SIR JAMES WOTTON'S WILL WHICH AS TOLD BY THE GOOD ATTORNEY AND JUMBLED BY THE CLATTER WAS PERHAPS A LITTLE DREARY
NEITHER GHOST NOR SPECTRAL ILLUSION BUT FLESH AND BLOOD--THOUGH IN MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HORROR OF A MADMAN AKIN TO THE GHOSTLY OR DEMONIAC
AS IF SOMETHING MORE WERE EXPECTED
BUT SOMEHOW GENERALLY THINGS CAME PRETTY RIGHT IN THE END
CHAPTER XXXIV
AND I SAW A GOOD DEAL OF HER
I OFTEN WONDER SO CHRISTIAN A MAN AS MR LARKIN CAN COUNTENANCE HIM
LARKIN HAD A HOLY RELIANCE UPON HIS RELIGIOUS REPUTATION WHICH HAD ALWAYS STOOD HIM IN STEAD
I USED TO THINK MYSELF BRAVE
I'M STAYING FOR A FEW DAYS AT THE LODGE--LARKIN'S HOUSE
THE OLD SERVANT HAD PLACED THE TEA-THINGS ON THE TABLE AND WHAT REMAINED OF THAT WINE OF WHICH STANLEY HAD PARTAKEN ON THE NIGHT FROM WHICH THE ECLIPSE OF RACHEL'S LIFE DATED
I THINK IT BETTER TO TRUST ENTIRELY TO THE MEANS YOU HAVE ALREADY EMPLOYED
HOW DARED HER HUSBAND MASK FROM HER WHAT HE CONFIDED TO ANOTHER
THE LEVEL MOONLIGHT WAS SHINING THROUGH THE STAINED HERALDIC WINDOW AND FELL BRIGHT ON THE PORTRAIT OF UNCLE LORNE AT THE OTHER END THROWING A PATCH OF RED LIKE A STAIN ON ONE SIDE OF ITS PALE FOREHEAD
CERTAIN SURE MASTER STANLEY WELL COME UP STAIRS TO YOUR MISTRESS'S ROOM SAID LAKE MOUNTING THE STAIRS WITH HIS HAT IN HIS HAND AND ON TIP-TOE LIKE A MAN APPROACHING A SICK CHAMBER
FOUKES AND MAULEY SAID MR LARKIN
BECAUSE I SUPPOSE LOVE TO BE A MADNESS AND THE SUBLIMEST AND THE MOST DESPICABLE OF STATES
SHE WAS CERTAINLY PERFECTLY NEAT AND CLEAN BUT WHITE PREDOMINATED UNPLEASANTLY IN HER COSTUME
YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED ALREADY IN FILLING DORCAS'S MIND WITH SURMISE AND SPECULATION AND DO YOU THINK THE GYLINGDEN PEOPLE ARE EITHER BLIND OR DUMB
DON'T KEEP LOOKING AT ME
THE DOOR WAS SHUT INSTANTLY AND I FOUND MYSELF STANDING AT IT AND LOOKING OUT UPON THE LOBBY WITH A CANDLE IN MY HAND AND ACTUALLY FREEZING WITH FOOLISH HORROR
AND MIND THIS--I'D RATHER BE DEAD THAN ANY CREATURE LIVING SHOULD KNOW IT
I COULD NOT HAVE FANCIED THAT SHE WHISPERED WITH A GASP
HOW HELPLESS AND APPALLED WE SHUT OUR EYES OVER THAT AWFUL CHASM
I AM GLAD STANLEY I HAPPENED TO MEET YOU
IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THOUGH I HARDLY HOPE IT THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE SOMETHING DEFINITE BY THIS EVENING'S POST
I HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT MARK WYLDER WOULD HAVE DONE--FOR HE SPOKE VERY FIERCELY ON THE SUBJECT--PERHAPS HE CONSULTED YOU NO NO
BUT I AM SURE HE CAN'T SUSPECT THAT I LIKE HIM
IT WAS NO FAULT OF MINE BUT I NEVER LIKED HIM
THIS SEQUESTERED TENEMENT BEARS THE NAME OF REDMAN'S FARM
IT WOULD LEAD HIM GRACEFULLY INTO DETAIL AND ALTOGETHER THE IDEA THE SITUATION THE SCENE AND PROSPECT WERE SO SOOTHING AND CHARMING THAT THE GOOD ATTORNEY FELT A SILENT EXALTATION AS HE LISTENED TO LORD CHELFORD'S TWO OR THREE DELIGHTED SENTENCES UPON THE ILLIMITABLE WONDERS AND MYSTERIES GLIMMERING IN THE HEAVENS ABOVE THEM
HE'S A VERY GENTLEMANLIKE FELLOW AND YOUR COUSIN MY COUSIN--THE DEVIL'S COUSIN--EVERYONE'S COUSIN
WITH A CRASH AMONG BRIARS AND A HEAVY THUMP FROM BENEATH THAT SHOOK THE EARTH THE MARE AND HER RIDER WENT OVER
HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT BUT HE IS WHAT HE IS AND I DON'T THINK HE'LL EVER CHANGE HE MAY BE WHAT HE WILL
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD TO HER AND SHE IS VERY GRATEFUL
I NEVER YET RESOLVED TO MAKE A WOMAN LIKE ME AND FAILED
I THOUGHT YOU HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE NOW SAID LAKE
IT WAS A HOPE
AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY BUT FIVE POUNDS IN THE WORLD UNTIL MARCH WHEN MY HALF-YEAR WILL BE PAID
BY THE TIME HIS LITTLE BOOK WAS AGAIN IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS POCKET THE TRAIN HAD ARRIVED AND DOORS SWUNG OPEN AND CLAPT AND PEOPLE GOT IN AND OUT TO THE PORTER'S ACCOMPANIMENT OF DOLLINGTON--DOLLINGTON--DOLLINGTON AND LAWYER LARKIN TOOK HIS PLACE AND GLIDED AWAY TO CHARTERIS WHERE HE HAD A WAIT OF TWO HOURS FOR THE RETURN TRAIN AND A GOOD DEAL OF BARREN TALK WITH PERSONS AT THE STATION REWARDED BY ONE OR TWO SENTENCES WORTH NOTING AND ACCORDINGLY DULY ENTERED IN THE SAME LITTLE POCKET-BOOK
AND THEY WALKED ALONG BROTHER AND SISTER IN THE SABBATH SUNSET LIGHT TO MEET HIM
AND THANKING YOU MOST EARNESTLY HE THROUGH ME BEGS MOST GRATEFULLY TO DECLINE IT
QUOD IMPOSSIBILE AGAIN
THERE HAD BEEN MORE NEED OF HIS VEIL TO HIDE THE GLORIOUS FACE OF GOD FROM HIM THAN TO HIDE HIS FROM GOD
THERE WAS A DARK ROOM A SORT OF ANTE-ROOM TO THE LIBRARY WITH ONLY TWO TALL AND NARROW WINDOWS AND HUNG WITH OLD DUTCH TAPESTRIES REPRESENTING THE BATTLES AND SIEGES OF MEN IN PERIWIGS PIKEMEN DRAGOONS IN BUFF COATS AND MUSKETEERS WITH MATCHLOCKS--ALL THE GRIM FACES OF SOLDIERS GENERALS DRUMMERS AND THE REST GROWN PALE AND DUSKY BY TIME LIKE ARMIES OF GHOSTS
MY FRIEND CAPTAIN LAKE DINES AT BRANDON TO-MORROW
I'LL SHOW YOU THOUGH IT'S NOT SO BAD AS YOU FANCY
THERE WAS NOT INDEED WHEN THEY MET YESTERDAY THE LEAST CHANGE OR CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE CAPTAIN'S MANNER
DO YOU KNOW YOU FRIGHTENED ME I THOUGHT I'D LOOK IN MISS BEFORE I WENT TO BED JUST TO SEE IF YOU WANTED ANYTHING NO--NOTHING THANK YOU DEAR TAMAR AND I DON'T THINK MISS RACHEL YOU ARE QUITE WELL TO-NIGHT THOUGH YOU ARE SO GAY--YOU'RE PALE DEAR
BEFORE HIM WHO JUDGES ALL AND KNOWS ALL THINGS--_UTTERLY AND DAMNABLY FALSE THE ATTORNEY MADE A BOW--IT WAS HIS BEST
I LONG TO TELL YOU THIS WHICH AFTER ALL IS AN UTTER ABSURDITY A THOUSAND TIMES MORE THAN YOU CAN DESIRE TO HEAR IT
AND ALTHOUGH MY AFFAIRS ARE IN A MOST UNPLEASANT AND COMPLICATED STATE I AM SURE THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE PERFECTLY SMOOTH IF ONLY I HAD RECEIVED THE LOAN MY KIND BROTHER INTENDS AND WHICH TO BE SURE AS YOU SAY ANY DAY I MAY RECEIVE BUT MY DEAR SIR DO YOU REALLY MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU WOULD PAY CLAIMS FROM VARIOUS QUARTERS--HOW OLD IS THIS FOR INSTANCE?--WITHOUT EXAMINATION THE VICAR LOOKED VERY BLANK
IT'S HIM BY AND MR LARKIN FORGETTING SYNTAX AND PROPRIETY AND RELIGION ALL TOGETHER AND MAKING A FRANTIC RACE TO KEEP UP WITH THE TRAIN SHOUTED STOP IT STOP IT--HOLLO!--STOP--STOP--HO STOP BUT HE PLEADED WITH THE WINDS
MR LARKIN ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AND ADJUSTED HIS RUG AND MUFFLERS ABOUT HIM FOR NOTWITHSTANDING THE SEASON THERE HAD BEEN SOME COLD RAINY WEATHER AND THE EVENING WAS SHARP
YOU CONFER AND CONSULT IN MY HOUSE--YOU DEBATE AND DECIDE UPON MATTERS MOST NEARLY CONCERNING FOR AUGHT I KNOW MY INTERESTS AND MY HAPPINESS--CERTAINLY DEEPLY AFFECTING YOU AND THEREFORE WHICH I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
AND WHEN AT LAST THE DUSKY OUTLINE OF THE HALL ROSE BEFORE ME IT WORE A SORT OF WEIRD AND HAUNTED ASPECT
I COULD NOT QUITE BELIEVE I HAD SEEN A GHOST
IT WAS THE FACE OF MARK WYLDER--SHE KNEW IT WELL--BUT GROWN FAT AND BROADER AND THERE WAS--BUT THIS SHE COULD NOT SEE DISTINCTLY--A PURPLISH SCAR ACROSS HIS EYEBROW AND CHEEK
HE WAS RATHER GLAD OF IT
I ASSURE YOU UPON MY HONOUR I'VE NO SECRET
THERE WAS SOMETHING EVIL AND SHRINKING IN HIS ASPECT WHICH I FELT WITH A SORT OF CHILL LIKE THE COMMENCING FASCINATION OF A SERPENT
BOULOGNE FOR INSTANCE A NEAT LITTLE RED CROSS OVER THE TOWN AND BENEATH 12TH OCTOBER 1854 BRIGHTON DITTO 20TH OCTOBER 1854 PARIS DITTO 17TH NOVEMBER 1854 MARSEILLES DITTO 26TH NOVEMBER 1854 FRANKFURT DITTO 22ND FEBRUARY 1855 GENEVA DITTO 10TH MARCH 1855 GENOA DITTO 20TH MARCH 1855 VENICE DITTO 28TH MARCH 1855 I MAY HERE MENTION THAT IN THE PRECEDING NOTATION I HAVE MARKED THE DAYS AND MONTHS EXACTLY BUT THE YEARS FANCIFULLY
IF YOUR FEELINGS INDEED HAD BEEN DIFFERENT AND THAT YOU HAD NOT MADE SUCH A POINT--YOU KNOW DON'T INSULT ME STANLEY BY TALKING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING
WELL I'M FAR FROM SAYING THAT BUT IT IS THEIR BUSINESS YOU KNOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CLIENT
YOU ARE CHOOSING YOUR CONFIDANT AND EXCLUDING ME
AT ALL EVENTS HE ONLY SAID IN A PETTISH BUT DEPRECATORY SORT OF WAY WELL WHERE'S THE GOOD OF SCOLDING
IT WAS ONE OF MANY OPENING UPON THE LONG GALLERY WHICH HAD BEEN THE SCENE FOUR GENERATIONS BACK OF THAT UNNATURAL AND BLOODY MIDNIGHT DUEL WHICH HAD LAID ONE SCION OF THIS ANCIENT HOUSE IN HIS SHROUD AND DRIVEN ANOTHER A FUGITIVE TO THE MORAL SOLITUDES OF A CONTINENTAL BANISHMENT
AT LAST HOWEVER IT DREW NEARER--NEARER--QUITE CLOSE--AND A SORT OF NONDESCRIPT VEHICLE--ONE HORSED--LOOMED IN THE DARK AND HE CALLS HALLO
THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE WERE LONGER THAN ALL THE REST PUT TOGETHER AND I THINK WOULD CONTINUE TO BE SO WERE MY FUTURE EXTENDED TO AN ANTE-NOACHIAN SPAN
THERE IS NOT MUCH TO BE DONE JUST NOW I FANCY IN THE GARDENING WAY
HE QUESTIONED HIS MAMMA AND CROSS-EXAMINED THE NURSE AND LOOKED GRAVE AND VERY MUCH ANNOYED
LOSE NO TIME AND I'LL GIVE YOU HALF-A-CROWN LUKE STUCK ON HIS GREASY WIDEAWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOG-CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
WELL MR LARCOM I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN LED INTO AN ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION
YOU CAN'T BE TOO FRANK AND HUMBLE WHEN YOU HAVE WRONGED YOUR NEIGHBOUR
JUST FOR THE SAKE OF HER ESTATE--IT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD OF COURSE AND ALL THAT--BUT IS NOT IT A LITTLE BIT SHABBY DON'T YOU THINK
WILL YOU DANCE THIS SET--ARE YOU ENGAGED MISS BRANDON HE SAID IN LOW EAGER TONES
I WAS YET TO LEARN A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THIS VISITATION
I PROMISE UPON MY HONOUR I'LL NOT SAY A WORD ABOUT IT TILL YOU BID ME I KNOW STANLEY--I KNOW THEN WHY WON'T YOU LOOK DOWN OR LOOK UP OR LOOK ANY WAY YOU PLEASE ONLY DON'T STARE AT ME SO YES--OH YES AND SHE SHUT HER EYES
YOU DON'T COMPLAIN AND YOU'RE NOT BITTER ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE HAD GREAT MISFORTUNES MY POOR RACHEL THERE BE LADIES YOUNG AND OLD WHO THE MOMENT THEY ARE PITIED THOUGH NEVER SO CHEERFUL BEFORE WILL FORTHWITH DISSOLVE IN TEARS
HE TOLD LORD CHELFORD THAT THE CASE WAS A VERY NASTY ONE IN FACT THE CHANCES WERE AGAINST THE CAPTAIN AND HE BUDDLE WOULD WISH A CONSULTATION WITH A LONDON SURGEON--WHOEVER LORD CHELFORD LEAD MOST CONFIDENCE IN--SIR FRANCIS SEDDLEY HE THOUGHT WOULD BE VERY DESIRABLE--BUT OF COURSE IT WAS FOR THE FAMILY TO DECIDE
STANLEY LAKE WAS AT HER SHOULDER AS SHE ENTERED AND BOTH WERE WHITE WITH AGITATION
AND HE SHALL CALL AT THE VICAR'S AND SEE DOLLY AND BRING US WORD HOW THE DEAR LITTLE BOY IS
PAUL'S ELEVEN BEAT FIFTEEN OF THE ISHMAELITES ABOUT A FORTNIGHT SINCE
I NEVER WENT FURTHER THAN THAT
IN WHICH UNCLE LORNE TROUBLES ME
SHE HAS DANCED WITH HIM TWICE ON THE CONTRARY AND HAS SUFFERED HIS AGREEABLE CONVERSATION ALL THE EVENING
YOU KNOW MY DEAR MR WYLDER I TOLD YOU FROM THE FIRST THAT MESSRS
D--D NONSENSE
SIR HARRY BRACTON HAD ACTUALLY INVADED THE TOWN OF GYLINGDEN
DON'T YOU POOR MR BUTTLE DID NOT KNOW LORD CHELFORD AND THUS SHOOTING HIS ARROW O'ER THE HOUSE HE HURT HIS BROTHER CHELFORD TURNED AWAY AND BOWED AND SMILED TO ONE OR TWO FRIENDS AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM
SOME DISAPPOINTMENT HERE AND THERE WITH CUSTOMARY SNEERS AND COMPASSION AND A GOOD DEAL OF GENUINE AMUSEMENT NOT ILL-NATURED
IT WILL PROBABLY BE FOUND THAT YOU DO NOT IN REALITY OWE SIXTY POUNDS OF EVERY HUNDRED CLAIMED AGAINST YOU OH MR LARKIN IF I COULD INDUCE YOU MR LARKIN SMILED A MELANCHOLY SMILE AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
BUT THE CUP OF HIS TRIBULATION WAS NOT YET QUITE FULL
2
SEE MASTER STANLEY IF I DON'T SAY IT TO YOU I MUST TO ANOTHER SHE SAID
SO LET ME MENTION THAT JUST ABOUT THE TIME WHEN WYLDER AND I WERE FILMING THE TRUNKS OF THE OLD TREES WITH WREATHS OF LINGERING PERFUME MISS RACHEL LAKE HAD AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR
THEN HE TOOK A LITTLE GAZETTEER OFF A TINY SHELF NEAR THE BELL-ROPE WHERE WAS A RAILWAY GUIDE AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY A FRENCH DITTO AND A BIBLE AND WITH HIS SHARP PENKNIFE HE DEFTLY SLICED FROM ITS PLACE IN THE WORK OF REFERENCE THE FOLDED MAP OF EUROPE
THERE IS ALWAYS A LITTLE SHOCK AFTER AN ABSENCE OF SOME YEARS BEFORE IDENTITIES ADJUST THEMSELVES AND THEN WE FIND THE CHANGE IS NOT AFTER ALL SO VERY GREAT
THE SUM INSUFFICIENT GREAT AS IT IS
IF THIS LETTER WAS TRUE THERE WAS NOT A MOMENT TO BE LOST IN BRINGING THE PURCHASE OF THE VICAR'S REVERSION TO A POINT
AND I REALLY THINK I HAVE BROUGHT MY LITTLE EVIDENCES VERY PRETTILY TOGETHER AND JUMPED TO A RIGHT CONCLUSION--EH A FLICKER OF THAT SINISTER SHADOW I HAVE SOMETIMES MENTIONED CROSSED LARKIN'S FACE AND CONTRACTED HIS EYES AS HE SAID A LITTLE STERNLY I HAVE NOTHING ON EARTH TO CONCEAL SIR
YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM I THINK--RATHER A STRONG COMMITTEE
THIS PICTURE WAS PALE AND HAD A LONG CHIN AND SOMEHOW HAD IMPRESSED MY BOYHOOD WITH A SINGULAR SENSE OF FEAR
I REALLY DON'T THINK WYLDER CARES TWOPENCE ABOUT HER OR SHE ABOUT HIM AND STANLEY LAKE LAUGHED GENTLY AND SLEEPILY
THE SHADOWS DEEPENED ROUND HER BUT SHE DID LOOK UP NOR CALL IN THE OLD CHEERFUL ACCENTS FOR LIGHTS
BUT THE OLD FIERCE DEFIANT SPIRIT AWOKE
AND HAVE NO GROUNDS FOR ILL-WILL--EH SAID THE CAPTAIN DRILY
THE EXPENSES WERE LIKELY TO BE AWFUL AND SOME ALLOWANCE WAS TO BE MADE FOR HIS STATE OF MIND
OH THAT THE PROPHET BUDDLE WERE HERE TO END MY TREMENDOUS SUSPENSE AND TO ANNOUNCE A REPRIEVE FROM HEAVEN WHILE THE WOUNDED CAPTAIN LAY ON THE BED WITH HIS CLOTHES ON AND THE COVERLET OVER HIM AND THAT CLAY-COLOURED APATHETIC FACE WITH CLOSED EYES UPON THE PILLOW WITHOUT SIGH OR MOTION NOT A WHISPERED WORD ESCAPED HIM
I AM BOUND IN HONOUR AND CONSCIENCE NOT TO DISTURB IT--I HAVE WRITTEN TO MESSRS
I HAD BETTER THEN COMMUNICATE WITH BURLINGTON AND SMITH BY THIS POST
STILL THERE WAS A CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN CONCILIATORY MANNERS AND EXQUISITE TACT
BURLINGTON AND SMITH A PEREMPTORY DEMAND FOR THE FOURTEEN POUNDS TEN SHILLINGS AND AN EQUALLY SUMMARY ONE FOR TWENTY-EIGHT POUNDS FOURTEEN SHILLINGS AND EIGHT PENCE THEIR COSTS IN THIS MATTER
RACHEL HAS A RIDICULOUS WAY OF TALKING LIKE AN ORACLE AND TREATING AS SETTLED FACT EVERY ABSURDITY SHE FANCIES
UPON MY WORD I BELIEVE YOU HAVEN'T CLEAR TWO HUNDRED A YEAR
I ONLY CAME DOWN TO TELL YOU BECAUSE RADIE YOU KNOW YOU PROPOSED IT YOURSELF
WHO'S THAT DRAWLED CAPTAIN LAKE RISING PALE AND HALF AWAKE ON HIS ELBOW AND NOT VERY CLEAR WHERE HE WAS
THE TOWN CLERK PRESSED HIS ARM WITH A SIGNIFICANT SIDE NOD AND A WINK WHICH SEEMED TO SAY I UNDERSTAND HIM
INDEED HE SELDOM SHOWED IN THOSE PREMISES WHICH HE CONSIDERED DECIDEDLY LOW DROPPING IN ONLY NOW AND THEN LIKE THE GREAT COUNTY GENTLEMEN ON SESSIONS DAYS TO GLANCE AT THE PAPERS AND GOSSIP ON THEIR OWN HIGH AFFAIRS
THE UNSEEN MINISTERS OF A STUPENDOUS EQUITY HAVE THEIR EYES AND THEIR HANDS ABOUT EVERY MAN'S PORTION
DREADFUL AS WERE THE TRADESMEN'S PEREMPTORY AND WRATHFUL LETTERS THE PROMPTITUDE AND ENERGY OF THIS LATTER PERSONAGE WERE SUCH AS TO PRODUCE A SENSE OF IMMEDIATE DANGER SO ACUTE THAT THE SCARED VICAR OPENED HIS DISMAL CASE TO HIS BROTHER MARK
EVER SINCE HIS CONFERENCE WITH THE VICAR GOOD MR LARKIN HAD BEEN DIMLY THINKING OF A THING
AT ALL EVENTS HE COULD SEE IT NO MORE
IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE LIBRARY DOOR OPENED AND STANLEY LAKE PEEPED IN
BUT SHE SHALL
I WON'T PART WITH TAMAR SHE HAS NOT COST ME MUCH SAID LAKE WHOSE TEMPER WAS NOT OF A KIND TO PASS BY ANYTHING
I DARE SAY HE LIED ALWAYS AND ABOUT EVERYTHING
SO ALTHOUGH THE WEIRD WHITE WOMAN WHO LEERED AFTER HIM SO STRANGELY AS HE WALKED WITH HIS MOST LORDLY AIR OUT OF THE LITTLE GARDEN AND DOWN THE DARKENING ROAD TOWARDS GYLINGDEN COULD NOT SAY HE RESOLVED TO MAKE TRIAL AGAIN
OLD CHUDWORTH OFFERED THAT ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO OF COURSE CAPTAIN LAKE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FANCY PRICE FROM ME I MUST ABANDON THE IDEA
ONE NIGHT AFTER A LONG TALK IN THE MORNING WITH GOOD WILLIAM WYLDER AND GREAT DEJECTION FOLLOWING ALL ON A SUDDEN RACHEL SAT UP IN HER BED AND IN A PLEASANT VOICE AND LOOKING MORE LIKE HERSELF THAN SHE HAD FOR MANY MONTHS SHE SAID I THINK I HAVE FOUND THE TRUE WAY OUT OF MY TROUBLES TAMAR
IT WAS NOT HIS DOING NOR MINE BUT SOMETHING ELSE
WHO IS THAT CRIED MISS LAKE A LITTLE SHARPLY
OF COURSE HIS HOST WAS PROPERLY AFFLICTED AND SYMPATHETIC
THERE WAS NO REASON HOWEVER WHY THE RESPECTABLE LAWYER SHOULD NOT MAKE WHATEVER WAS TO BE FAIRLY MADE OF THE SITUATION
THE IRON SAFE IN WHICH HE KEPT HIS KEYS FILLED ONE OF ITS NOOKS
AND IT IS SO DELIGHTFUL TO HAVE FOR MY GUIDE A CHRISTIAN MAN WHO EVEN WERE I SO DISPOSED WOULD NOT LEND HIMSELF TO AN UNWORTHY OR QUESTIONABLE DEFENCE
THERE WAS NOTHING VERY GENIAL OR PROMISING THEREFORE IN THE RELATIONS OF OUR LITTLE PARTY AND I DID NOT EXPECT A VERY AGREEABLE EVENING
I GOT INTO BRANDON PARK BY THE PRETTY GATE NEAR LATHAM
THE VICAR LOOKED AT HER WITH HIS EYES WIDE OPEN PUZZLED LIKE A MAN WHO IS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER HE MAY NOT BE DOING SOMETHING WRONG
BUT I THINK YOU'LL SAY IT WAS TIME WELL SPENT AT LEAST I'M SURE YOU'LL APPROVE THE RESULT
SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY CARE FOR WYLDER ANY MORE THAN HE CARED FOR HER
THE SAME EARTH FOR THE LIVING
SO NOISELESSLY RACHEL LAKE WITHOUT MORE PARLEY STEPPED INTO THE ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR
BUT YOU ARE NOT AFRAID TO WALK A PART OF THE WAY HOME WITHOUT ME
THAT'S ALL SO JIM DUTTON MADE HIS BOW AND DEPARTED
I BELIEVE WE LEARN TO PRIZE HOME MORE THE LONGER WE LIVE WHAT A WISE OLD LADY
OH I'M SO GLAD--HERE'S THE FINGER POST AT LAST AND THEN--'WELL HERE WE ARE AT THE CAT AND FIDDLE I THOUGHT WE'D NEVER PASS IT AND AT LAST THE BROUGHAM STOPPED AT THE LITTLE GARDEN-GATE AT THE FAR END OF THE VILLAGE
AND THE CLERGYMAN WALKED WITH ME A LONG WHILE TO-AND-FRO TO-AND-FRO UPON THE EARTH TELLING ME THE WONDERS OF THE ABYSS AND IS IT FROM THE ABYSS SIR HE WRITES HIS LETTERS ENQUIRED THE TOWN CLERK WITH A WINK AT LAKE
I'VE BEEN SO STUPID AND INATTENTIVE
SHE LOOKED UP WITH THE INSTINCT OF PRAYER AND CLASPED HER HANDS ON THE HANDLE OF THAT LITTLE BAG WHICH HAD MADE THE MYSTERIOUS JOURNEY WITH HER
IT WAS THE ONLY MOTION SHE HAD OBSERVED HIS FACE LAY JUST AS IT HAD DONE ON THE PILLOW
I HAVE A LITTLE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED A-YEAR
THE WYLDERS HAD NOT MUCH TO BOAST OF EVEN IN CONTRAST WITH THAT WICKED LINE
NO MATTER
NOT THAT HE DISTURBED THEM MUCH BUT THEY WERE A GRAVE AND GENTLEMANLIKE PROPERTY AND HE LIKED THEM FOR THEIR BINDING AND THE IMPRESSION THEY PRODUCED ON HIS VISITORS
THE THING ITSELF WAS A GHOSTLY SLUR UPON THE HOUSE AND TO RUN AWAY A REPROACH TO MY MANHOOD
LIKE A MAN DOING THINGS IN A DREAM WITHOUT THOUGHT OR TROUBLE ONLY WAITING AND LISTENING FOR A MOMENT BEFORE HE DISTURBED THEM HE TOOK AWAY THE IMPLEMENTS WHICH HE REQUIRED
HE'S A DELIGHTFULLY IMPUDENT CHAP AND GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND I WAS A LIMB OF THE DEVIL AND HE A SAINT
STANLEY SIPPED HIS CLARET HIS EYES UPON THE CLOTH
UNLUCKILY HOWEVER FOR JOS.'S CASE ONE OF HIS CLEVER LETTERS WRITTEN DURING THE NEGOTIATION TURNED UP AND WAS PUT IN EVIDENCE IN WHICH HE PRESSED CAPTAIN LAKE WITH THE FACT THAT HE THE PURCHASER WAS ACTUALLY IN POSSESSION OF INFORMATION TO THE EFFECT THAT MARK WAS DEAD AND THAT HE WAS THEREFORE BUYING UNDER A LIABILITY OF HAVING HIS TITLE LITIGATED WITH A DOUBTFUL RESULT THE MOMENT HE SHOULD ENTER INTO POSSESSION
WILLIAM WYLDER MEANWHILE WAS TROUBLED AND HIS MIND CLOUDED BY MORE SORROWS THAN ONE
I'D LIKE TO SEE THE PLACE AGAIN--AND--AND THE WALKS--BUT NOT I THINK FOR A LONG TIME
LEARNING IS BETTER FOUND IN BOOKS AND AS FOR WIT IS IT ALWAYS PLEASANT
AND MARK'S DEATH IS BY THIS TIME A NEARLY FORGOTTEN MYSTERY
THERE'S NOTHING REMARKABLE IN STANLEY POOR FELLOW EXCEPT HIS FAULTS
SO WILL SHE
LARKIN'S TONE WAS NOW MUCH MODERATED
IT IS ODD ENOUGH--VERY ODD SAID LARKIN
THOUGH YOU DO NOT REKELECT ME SIR I KNOW YOU WELL MR LARKINS HAVEN SEEN YOU HOFFEN WHEN A BOY
THE GALLANT GENTLEMAN WAS REMOVED FROM THE SCENE OF HIS MISADVENTURE TO BRANDON HALL CLOSE TO WHICH THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED AND AT WHICH MANSION HIS NOBLE RELATIVES LORD CHELFORD AND THE DOWAGER LADY CHELFORD ARE AT PRESENT STAYING ON A VISIT
LAWYER LARKIN YOUR EYES THOUGH VERY SMALL ARE VERY SHARP
RELY UPON IT WE'LL DO THE BEST WE CAN FOR YOU HE CONTINUED IN A PATRONISING WAY WITH HIS CHIN RAISED AND EXTENDING HIS HAND KINDLY TO SHAKE THAT OF THE PARSON
I AM UNCLE LORNE
IN WHICH VARIOUS PERSONS GIVE THEIR OPINIONS OF CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE
I COULD NOT IMAGINE--I AM AMAZED YOU HAVE SO TAKEN IT BUT YOU THINK I EXERCISE SOME CONTROL OR COERCION OVER MY COUSIN MR MARK WYLDER
BUT MARK HAD A DECIDED OBJECTION TO MANY LETTERS
THESE FOUR GENTLEMEN BESIDE MYSELF WERE PRESENT AT THE OCCURRENCE
YOU SAY DEAD AND GONE CAPTAIN LAKE CURSED HIM AND HIS ABSENT KEEPER BETWEEN HIS TEETH
I DREAMED HOW MASTER STANLEY WAS COMING THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU DID DID YOU
I THINK YOU A HEROINE RADIE
WITH A GOOD-NIGHT GOOD-NIGHT WE PARTED AND I HEARD THEIR RETREATING STEPS CRUNCHING ALONG THE WALK THAT LED TO REDMAN'S HOLLOW AND BY MISS RACHEL'S QUIET HABITATION
THE PARTY WERE JUST NINE--AND IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT A ROW NINE WELL-BEHAVED PEOPLE WILL CONTRIVE TO MAKE AT A DINNER-TABLE
HE TOOK A TALL-STEMMED VENETIAN GLASS THAT STOOD UPON THE CABINET AN ANTIQUE DECORATION AND FILLED IT WITH SHERRY--A STRANGE REVIVAL OF OLD SERVICE
HOW VERY SILENT DORCAS WAS THOUGHT RACHEL AS THEY DROVE FROM GYLINGDEN
OF MARK WYLDER NOT A TRACE WAS DISCOVERABLE
I'VE BEEN THINKING OF HIM DO YOU KNOW AND I SHOULD LIKE TO FIND HIM OUT
IT WAS WITH THE CORNER OR AS THE ITALIANS HAVE IT THE TAIL OF MY EYE THAT I SAW OR IMAGINED THAT I SAW THIS TRIFLING BUT UNPLEASANT MOVEMENT
THEY DID SO
LARKIN'S INTIMIDATING SMIRK WITH A LOOK OF FURY WHICH--FOR HE NOW BELIEVED HE HELD THE WINNING CARDS--DID NOT APPAL HIM
SO THE LITERAL WAITER KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
WHAT A PRODIGALITY OF OAK
HIS EXCITEMENT WAS TOO INTENSE FOR FOUL TERMS OR EVEN BLASPHEMY
I'LL TAKE THE RUG IT'S TOO HEAVY FOR YOU AND I MAY AS WELL HAVE IT TO DOLLINGTON HE KISSED HER CHEEK IN HIS SLIGHT WAY AND LEFT HER AND WAS SOON ON HIS WAY TO DOLLINGTON WHERE HE SLEPT THAT NIGHT--RATHER MORE COMFORTABLY THAN HE HAD DONE SINCE RACHEL'S DEPARTURE
I LOOKED AT HER AS SHE STOOD GRAVELY GAZING FROM THE WINDOW
BUT NOT I VENTURE TO THINK ABSOLUTELY
BUT SOMEHOW HER TALK WAS NEITHER SO GAY NOR SO VOLUBLE AS IT USED TO BE
NONE WHATEVER CAPTAIN LAKE AND YOU WILL THEREFORE PERCEIVE THAT WHATEVER I NOW SAY SPEAKING IN COOL BLOOD I AM NOT LIKELY TO RECEDE FROM LAWYER LARKIN BOWED
AND LET THE FUN GO FORWARD
I DON'T SUPPOSE AT BRANDON
A POINT HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED--AS SOMETIMES HAPPENS--AND JOS
THANK HEAVEN YOU ARE BETTER YES--YES--A GREAT DEAL BETTER
IN A FEW MINUTES MORE MISS BRANDON HAD LEFT THE SUPPER-ROOM LEANING UPON LORD CHELFORD'S ARM
I SAID MARK WYLDER DON'T NAME HIM SHE SAID RISING AND APPROACHING HIM SWIFTLY
AS ALSO WITH THE SHERIFF WHO HAS BEEN VERY KIND OH NO!--OH NO MR LARKIN!--PRAY I'M QUITE READY TO SIGN NOW WILLIAM WYLDER YOU SHA'N'T SIGN UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHETHER THIS IS A SALE OF YOUR REVERSION THE YOUNG LADY HAD HER WHITE HAND FIRMLY PRESSED UPON THE SPOT WHERE HE WAS TO SIGN AND THE RING THAT GLITTERED ON HER FINGER LOOKED LIKE A TALISMAN INTERPOSING BETWEEN THE POOR VICAR AND THE MOMENTOUS ACT HE WAS MEDITATING
A REPUTABLE INMATE TRULY AND A PLEASANT ECLAIRCISSEMENT THIS WAS ONE OF HIS FRENCH WORDS AND PRONOUNCED BY HIM WITH HIS USUAL ACCURACY PRECISELY AS IT IS SPELT)--A PLEASANT ECLAIRCISSEMENT_--WHENEVER THAT LONDON EXCURSION AND ITS CREDITABLE CIRCUMSTANCES COME TO LIGHT CHAPTER LXI
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED BUT WYLDER SAT BESIDE MISS LAKE
OR SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER IMPOVERISHED HIS FAMILY NOT CREDITABLY
SHE KNEW THAT SHE HAD DONE RIGHT
BUT IN A WHILE SHE WAKENED QUITE AND HEARD THE DOUBLE KNOCKS ONE AFTER ANOTHER IN QUICK SUCCESSION
THOUGH THE WEATHER WAS USUALLY COLD I DON'T THINK SHE EVER WAS COOL DURING THAT PERIOD--I AM SURE SHE NEVER SLEPT--I DON'T THINK SHE ATE--AND I AM AFRAID HER RELIGIOUS EXERCISES WERE NEGLECTED
THE YOUNG LADY YOU MENTION NEVER EVEN SAW MR MARK WYLDER SINCE SHE TOOK LEAVE OF HIM IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AT BRANDON
I THINK LORD CHELFORD PERCEIVED THERE WAS SOMETHING AMISS BETWEEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR HIS EYE RESTED ON RACHEL WITH A MOMENTARY LOOK OF ENQUIRY UNCONSCIOUS NO DOUBT AND QUICKLY AVERTED AND HE WENT ON CHATTING PLEASANTLY
YES SAID LORD CHELFORD IN A VERY LOW TONE RETURNING HER GAZE SOLEMNLY
AND THEREFORE I CANNOT SAY HOW MISS BRANDON PERSUADED HER HANDSOME COUSIN RACHEL TO GO WITH HER PARTY UNDER THE WING OF OLD LADY CHELFORD TO THE HUNT BALL OF GYLINGDEN
THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE WHOM ONE COULD NOT ASSOCIATE WITH COMFORTABLY
I DO ASSURE YOU SO FAR FROM TAKING HER ADVICE AND THINKING HER AN ORACLE AS YOU SUPPOSE I BELIEVE HER IN SOME RESPECTS VERY LITTLE REMOVED FROM A FOOL I THINK HER VERY CLEVER ON THE CONTRARY SAID DORCAS ENIGMATICALLY
IT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD AS YOU SAY AND THERE'S AN END OF IT THEY SAY SHE'S SUCH A BEAUTY
ANCESTRY CAPTAIN LAKE--_YOUR ANCESTRY--NOBLE ASSEMBLAGE--MONUMENTS AND TIMBER
YOU HAVE OFTEN HEARD ME SPEAK OF HIM
TO BE SURE YES
IN ONE OF THE GREAT STONE VASES THAT ARE RANGED ALONG THE TERRACE THERE FLOURISHED A BEAUTIFUL AND RARE ROSE
AND I'M NO WORSE OFF NOW THAN ANY TIME FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS
IF DORCAS BRANDON HAD BEEN A PLAIN WOMAN I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VOTED AN IMPERTINENT BORE
AND IT IS GROWING COLD THROW AWAY THAT CIGAR AND COME IN IN A MINUTE
I THOUGHT YOU MUST HAVE FORMED SOME POLITICAL PROJECT MR WEALDON HAS BEEN WITH YOU SO OFTEN
WELL DEAR ME NO INDEED;'--AND IN AN EARNEST WHISPER CLOSE IN HIS EAR--'A PRESENT TO MISS BRANDON AND THE DONOR IS NOT A HUNDRED MILES AWAY FROM YOUR ELBOW MY LORD AND SHE WINKED SLYLY AND LAUGHED WITH A LITTLE NOD AT WYLDER
MYSTERY ALREADY--MYSTERY FROM THE FIRST
NOT ALTOGETHER THROUGH HORROR OR GRIEF THOUGH HE FELT BOTH
THAT IS THE SORT OF THING YOU KNOW--OF COURSE WITH A DIFFERENCE--A GIRL IS SUPPOSED TO SPEAK THERE
IN THE GUILTY PATH YOU HAVE OPENED FOR ME ONE STEP MORE I WILL NEVER TREAD EXCUSE ME RADIE BUT YOU'RE TALKING LIKE A FOOL I AM NOT SORRY YOU THINK SO--YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND MOTIVES HIGHER THAN YOUR OWN YOU'LL SEE THAT YOU MUST THOUGH
HIS CHEEKS WERE WET WITH TEARS AND HIS PRETTY LITTLE NOSE RED THOUGH HE WAS SMILING
I'VE BEEN SHUT UP SO IN THE LIBRARY AND KEEPING SUCH TIRESOME COMPANY--YOU'VE NO IDEA
I AM AFRAID OUR FRIEND JOS
THE HOUSEKEEPER SAY SHE THINKS MY LORD THE ROOM HOPPOSIT WHERE MR SLEDD THE ARCHITECK SLEP WHEN ERE WOULD ANSWER VERY NICE
BUT IT IS REALLY NOT MUCH WHEN YOU HEAR ME OUT
SKILL AND INDUSTRY CONQUER CHURLISH NATURE--AND THIS IS MY VERSAILLES I DON'T BELIEVE IN THOSE STICKS AND SCISSORS AND WATERING-POTS
YES POOR DEAR OLD TAMAR
THE LEAN FIGURE IN THE BLACK FROCK-COAT AND BLACK SILK WAISTCOAT WITH THAT GREAT GLEAMING WATCH-CHAIN THE LONG SHABBY WITHERED FACE AND FLUSHED BALD FOREHEAD
BUT HE'S VERY FAR FROM A FOOL YES OF COURSE HE KNOWS GREEK POETS AND LATIN FATHERS AND ALL THE REST OF IT
AN HOURLY BULLETIN UP TO TWELVE O'CLOCK SHOULD BE IN THE HALL OF THE BRANDON ARMS AND REDMAN'S DELL GREW QUIET ONCE MORE
TRY ONE OF THESE SAID THE PEER PRESENTING HIS CIGAR CASE
AND NOW THAT I HAVE COLLECTED THE FACTS AND CAN SHOW YOU DARLING EXACTLY WHAT THE CHANCES ARE YOU MUST CONSENT TO HEAR THE LONG STORY AND WHEN YOU HAVE HEARD GIVE ME YOUR ADVICE DORCAS SMILED AND ONLY PLUCKED A LITTLE FLOWERY TENDRIL FROM A PLANT THAT HUNG IN A NATURAL FESTOON ABOVE HER
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM AND I DO KNOW YOU--DON'T YOU SEE
MARK'S LATIN WAS SAILOR-LIKE 2
YET WITH ALL ITS WEAKNESS THERE WAS A DANGEROUS FORCE IN THE CHARACTER WHICH ON THE WHOLE INSPIRED AN ODD MIXTURE OF FEAR AND CONTEMPT
HE'S COLD
IT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT HAD INTERESTED HER FOR DAYS
GOOD-BYE MISS LAKE AND AWAY WENT WEALDON WILD PALE AND HATLESS LIKE A MAN PURSUED BY ROBBERS
HE WAS NOT A GREAT ADEPT--YET AT LEAST--LIKE THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO CAN SWALLOW FIVE HUNDRED DROPS OF LAUDANUM AT A SITTING
BUT THAT IS A VIEW OF THE OCCURRENCE IN WHICH EXCEPT AS A MATTER OF DEEP REGRET I CANNOT BE SUPPOSED TO BE IMMEDIATELY INTERESTED
HE'S SO UNSCRUPULOUS
AND THAT THE WORTHY BARONET SO APPEALED TO AND BEING A BLUNT SORT OF FELLOW AND AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF STANLEY'S DID IN A SHORT AND TESTY SORT OF WAY CORROBORATE CAPTAIN LAKE'S STORY HAVING PREVIOUSLY CONDITIONED THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE REFERRED TO AS THE AUTHORITY FROM WHOM MR LARKIN HAD LEARNED IT
AND SO LITTLE WAS HE ACQUAINTED WITH THE GENTLEMAN THAT HE FORGOT HE WAS AN EVANGELIST DOING GOOD UNDER THE STYLE AND TITLE OF MARK
BUT WHEN SHE TRIES TO TALK OF SERIOUS BUSINESS--POOR RADIE
OH DEAR MISS LAKE--RACHEL I MEAN--RACHEL DEAR I HOPE IT WON'T BE ALL OFF
THAT GENTLEMAN ON THE CONTRARY HE HAD SEEN ALIVE AND WELL AT SHILLINGSWORTH ON THE NIGHT PREVIOUS
IT WAS ALSO SAID THAT IT HAD IN SOME WAY HAD REFERENCE TO MISS BRANDON
AT ALL EVENTS THERE WAS THE GLITTER AND THE GENTLEMAN WAS AWAKE
WHAT WAS IT TAMAR LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AND SUSPICIOUSLY IN THE KITCHEN FIRE AND PLACED HER PUCKERED HAND TO THE SIDE OF HER WHITE LINEN CAP
LIKE OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF A DYNASTY SHE HAD STUDIED THE HISTORY OF HER RACE TO PROFIT BY ITS ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES
BUT CHELFORD WON'T BE MANAGED OR SCOLDED INTO ANYTHING OF THE KIND
AND AWAY WENT BUSY LITTLE FAIRY SMILING AND CHATTING WITH MARGERY TO SEE THE HENS AND CHICKENS IN THE YARD
MORE REGULAR ATTENDANTS IN CHURCH THAN I FEAR THEY FORMERLY WERE
BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE NEED NOT BE IN PROMINENCE
WOMEN ARE SO FULL OF CAPRICE AND HYPOCRISY AND HUMBUGGING IMPUDENCE WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
BUT LORD CHELFORD WAS AT HIS ELBOW--THE SUIT WAS RESISTED
MUCH TO-ING AND FRO-ING THERE WAS BETWEEN THE TOWN AND REDMAN'S FARM THE RESPECTABLE INHABITANTS ALL SENDING OR GOING UP TO ENQUIRE HOW THE CAPTAIN WAS DOING
BY THIS TIME YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT THE CHRONICLER OF THESE GYLINGDEN ANNALS HAD TAKEN HIS LEAVE OF MAGNIFICENT OLD BRANDON AND OF ITS STRANGELY INTERESTING YOUNG MISTRESS AND WAS CARRYING AWAY WITH HIM AS HE FLEW ALONG THE LONDON RAILS THE BROKEN IMAGERY OF THAT GRAND AND SHIVERED DREAM
WYLDER HAS NO CLAIM UPON ME
WHO BUILT THE OLD HOUSE--A BRANDON OR A WYLDER
IN A MAD_-HOUSE
AND THAT HE HAD SEEN HIM TWICE--ONCE BACKING JONATHAN WHEN HE BEAT THE GREAT AMERICAN BILLIARD-PLAYER
IT WAS A GREAT BREAK UP AND A WORSE FALL FOR RACHEL THAN FOR HER BROTHER WHEN THE PLATE COACHES PICTURES AND ALL THE VALUABLE EFFECTS OF OLD TIBERIUS WENT TO THE HAMMER AND HE HIMSELF VANISHED FROM HIS CLUBS AND OTHER HAUNTS AND LIVED ONLY--A THIN INTERMITTENT RUMOUR--SURMISED TO BE IN GAOL OR IN GUERNSEY AND QUITE FORGOTTEN SOON AND A LITTLE LATER ACTUALLY DEAD AND BURIED
IT IS THIS BEGINNING AT A POINT AND EXPANDING TO THE IMMENSE DISK OF OUR PRESENT RANGE OF SENSUOUS EXPERIENCE THAT GIVES TO THEM SO PRODIGIOUS AN ILLUSORY PERSPECTIVE AND MAKES US IN CHILDHOOD MEASURING FUTURITY BY THEM FORM SO WILD AND EXAGGERATED AN ESTIMATE OF THE DURATION OF HUMAN LIFE
NO NO LITTLE MAN
A GENTLEMAN OF VERY MODERATE ABILITIES WITH NO PROSPECTS AND WITHOUT FORTUNE WHO FINDS HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY DESERVINGS OF HIS OWN ON A SUDDEN POSSESSED OF AN ESTATE AND ABOUT TO BE UNITED TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HEIRESS IN ENGLAND IS I THINK RATHER A FORTUNATE PERSON YOU DID NOT ALWAYS THINK ME SO STUPID MISS LAKE SAID MR WYLDER SHOWING SOMETHING OF THE HECTIC OF VEXATION
IT IS ALL LADY CHELFORD'S DOING
BUT I MUST AND WILL SPEAK FRANKLY
LA
HERE IT IS AND HE EXTENDED HIS STUMPY BROWN LITTLE FINGER AND SHOWED A THICK COARSELY-MADE RING OF GOLD WITH AN UNCUT RED STONE OF THE SIZE OF A LARGE CHERRY STONE SET IN IT
FRENCH POLITICS RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA COMMERCIAL TREATIES PARTY COMBINATIONS HOW MEN CAN SO WRAP THEMSELVES UP IN THESE THINGS
HE ACCOUNTED FOR IT BY HIS ATTRIBUTES AND THE BLESSING THAT WAITS ON INDUSTRY AND INTEGRITY
LET US EACH TRY TO FORGET THAT THERE IS ANYTHING HIDDEN BETWEEN US IF EVER THE TIME COMES DEAR DORCAS WHEN I MAY TELL IT TO YOU I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU WILL BLESS OR HATE ME FOR HAVING KEPT IT SO WELL
IT WAS DARK BY THIS TIME AND THE DRAWING-ROOM A VAST AND GRAND CHAMBER WITH NO LIGHT BUT THE FIRE AND A PAIR OF DIM SOFT LAMPS NEAR THE SOFAS AND OTTOMANS LOFTY AND GLOWING WITH RICH TAPESTRY CURTAINS AND PICTURES AND MIRRORS AND CARVED OAK AND MARBLE--WAS ALREADY TENANTED BY THE LADIES
BUT HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE MARRIED WITHOUT AN INCOME VERY TRUE CAPTAIN LAKE--THERE'S NO DEFENDING THAT--IT WAS WRONG BUT THE RETRIBUTION IS TERRIBLE AND THE RIGHTEOUS MAN SHOOK HIS TALL HEAD
NOR TO COME INTO ANY PLACE BUT THIS--THE PARK I MEAN NO SIR AND DO YOU MIND TRY AND GET HIM HOME ALWAYS BEFORE NIGHTFALL
AND I DARE SAY IT MADE YOUNG LOCHINVAR A LITTLE NOISY AND SWAGGERING WHEN HE PROPOSED TREADING THE MEASURE"--IS NOT THAT THE PHRASE
THE DELF CUPS AND SAUCERS;--IT WILL BE TWICE AS GOOD IN THEM AND AS THE HANDSOME MISTRESS OF THE MANSION SITTING IN THE DEAL CHAIR LOOSENED HER CLOAK AND UNTIED HER BONNET SHE CHATTED AWAY TO THE EDIFICATION OF MARGERY AND THE AMUSEMENT OF BOTH
THE FAINTEST INDICATION OF SOMETHING LIKE A PEEVISH SNEER
STAY DEAR DON'T GO FOR A MOMENT
I KNOW ALSO THAT WHEN HIS TEMPER WHICH WAS NOTHING VERY REMARKABLE WAS EXCITED HE COULD BE SAVAGE AND BRUTAL ENOUGH
SHE PEEPED ROUND THE STONE IN WHOSE SHADOW SHE WAS SITTING
HE CONSULTED HIS WATCH AND SHE SAT FIXED AND POWERLESS AS A PORTION OF THE BLOCK ON WHICH SHE LEANED STARING UP AT THIS TO HER TERRIFIC APPARITION
LARKIN CAME FORWARD IN THE INTERESTS OF HUMANITY AND UNABLE TO RESIST THE IMPORTUNITIES OF A PARTY WHOM HE RESPECTED HE DID WHAT AT THE TIME APPEARED A VERY RISKY THING ALTHOUGH IT HAS TURNED OUT TOLERABLY SAFE IN THE LONG RUN THE SCREW WAS NOW TWISTED PRETTY WELL HOME UPON THE POOR VICAR WHO IF HE HAD ANY SENSE AT ALL WOULD REMEMBERING LARKIN'S EXPRESSIONS ONLY A WEEK BEFORE SUGGEST HIS BUYING AND SO THE CORRESPONDENCE WOULD DISCLOSE IN A MANNER MOST HONOURABLE TO THE ATTORNEY THE HISTORY OF THE PURCHASE
THERE WERE CERTAIN PHRASES IN THE WILL OF THE LATE MR WYLDER WHICH LIMITED A LARGE PORTION OF THE GREAT ESTATE IN STRICT SETTLEMENT
NOW OUR FRIEND JOS
VERY GREAT DANGER I FEAR SAID RACHEL
KEEP TO THE SHADY SIDE CLOSE BY THE HEDGE WHERE THE TREES STOP
LARKIN WAS RETURNING IN A HEAVENLY FRAME OF MIND TO THE LODGE BRANDON MANOR GYLINGDEN
AND I FORGOT TO TELL YOU TAMAR I'VE A RING FOR YOU IN TOWN--A LITTLE SOUVENIR
ITS FRAGRANT PETALS WERE NOW STREWN UPON THE TERRACE UNDERNEATH
DID NOT YOU LITTLE MAN
ALL THAT COULD BE GOT FROM JIM DUTTON WAS THAT HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE MISTOOK AND SO ATTENDED
IN THE STUDY WITH HIS WAPSIE
THEY BOWED AND STOOD GRINNING NEAR THE DOOR
ALTHOUGH BY JOVE
IT WAS ONLY A LARGE WAFER-STAMP SO HE BROKE IT OPEN AND DREW OUT A SHABBY VERY ILL-WRITTEN SCROLL
A MAN MY DEAR CAPTAIN LAKE WHOSE FATHER BEFORE HIM HAS BEEN A GENTLEMAN OLD LARKIN WHILE IN THE FLESH WAS AN ORGANIST AND KEPT A SMALL DAY SCHOOL AT DWIDDLESTON AND HIS GRANDFATHER HE DID NOT CARE TO ENQUIRE AFTER AND WHO HAS HAD THE EDUCATION OF ONE DOES NOT FEEL HIMSELF AT HOME YOU KNOW--I'M SURE YOU HAVE FELT THE SAME SORT OF THING YOURSELF OH
IN THIS LITTLE EXCURSION HE WAS CONCERNED FOR NO LESS THAN FIVE
NO PARTY MISS LAKE IN HIS POSITION EVER QUITE APPREHENDS EVEN IF HE COULD BRING HIMSELF FULLY TO STATE THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF HIS LIABILITIES
I MAY BE MISTAKEN OF COURSE
WHY MY DEAR IF YOU KNEW HIM AS WE DO YOU'D TRUST YOUR LIFE IN HIS HANDS BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW HIM STILL BETTER
IT IS THE DISTINCTIVE PRIVILEGE OF MAN TO EXERT HIS VOICE DURING HIS REPAST AND TO INDULGE ALSO IN THOSE SPECIALLY HUMAN CACHINNATIONS WHICH NO LOWER CREATURE EXCEPT THAT DISREPUTABLE AUSTRALIAN BIPED KNOWN AS THE LAUGHING JACKASS PRESUMES TO IMITATE
AND I THINK HIM EVERY WAY VERY NEARLY A FOOL
I COULD NOT IN THE LEAST TELL WHY
AND ITS OCCUPANT WAS THAT MISS LAKE WHOM I HAD MET LAST NIGHT AT BRANDON HALL AND WHOSE PLEASURE IT WAS TO LIVE HERE IN INDEPENDENT ISOLATION
NO SIR I DON'T SAID CAPTAIN LAKE FIXING HIS EYES FOR A MOMENT WITH A FRANK STARE ON THE ATTORNEY'S FACE
AND YOU MUST BRING YOUR TEA-CUP TOO AND WE'LL TAKE IT TOGETHER
HOW COULD THAT ILL-OMENED MAN HAVE DIVINED HER CONNECTION WITH THE INCIDENTS--THE UNKNOWN INCIDENTS--OF THAT DIREFUL NIGHT
I REALLY CAN'T SUSPECT SO MONSTROUS A THING
SHE ADDRESSED HERSELF ON THE CONTRARY ALTOGETHER TO HER LILIPUTIAN WHITE LAP-DOG SNOW AND PLAYED WITH HIS SILKEN EARS
SHE TOLERATES ME LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE
LITTLE FAIRY ALL THIS WHILE CONTINUED IN OUR CHURCH LANGUAGE SICK AND WEAK THE VICAR WAS VERY SORRY BUT NOT AFRAID
CHAPTER XX
I SEIZED THE OCCASION AND GAVE HER AS WELL AS I COULD THE SAD AND PRETTY PICTURE THAT REMAINED AND ALWAYS WILL IN THE VACANT AIR WHEN I THINK OF HER ON THE MYSTERIOUS RETINA OF MEMORY
THERE WAS SOME OTHER BUSINESS--BRANDON BUSINESS--TO BE TALKED OVER FIRST
PARKES MUST ACT FOR ME AS USUAL--NO BLUSTER ABOUT GIVING UP
AND FIRST I'LL TELL YOU UPON MY HONOUR WHAT RACHEL HAS BEEN WORRYING ME ABOUT DORCAS SATE BESIDE HIM ON THE SOFA AND HE PLACED HIS SLENDER ARM AFFECTIONATELY ROUND HER WAIST
HOW COULD SHE ACCOUNT FOR THIS DESPERATE HALLUCINATION
I NEVER HEARD THAT JIM GAVE ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY THE LEAST TROUBLE AFTERWARD
I--THIS--WELL THIS I CERTAINLY DO OWE
AND SEEMS SO PLEASED TO HAVE MET WITH SO CLEVER A PUPIL
YOU SAY YOU MUST RETURN TO GYLINGDEN NOW MR WYLDER
HERE'S A LECTURE OR AN EXHORTATION FROM MISS RADIE AND A QUANTITY OF INFINITELY ABSURD ADVICE ALL WHICH I AM TO READ AND INWARDLY DIGEST AND DISCUSS WITH HER WHENEVER SHE PLEASES
LOOK IN THE GLASS AND THEN INTO YOUR OWN HEART AND ASK YOUR CONSCIENCE NEXT AM I REALLY QUITE A HERO OR ALTOGETHER SO LOVELY AS I AM BELOVED KEEP THE ANSWER TO YOURSELF BUT BE TENDER WITH THE VEHEMENT FOLLIES OF YOUR JEALOUS WIFE
BY-THE-BYE ARE YOU ANYTHING OF A CRICKETER
HIS EYES HOWEVER HAPPENED TO WANDER IN AN UNLUCKY MOMENT TO OLD LADY CHELFORD WHO INSTANTANEOUSLY SIGNALLED TO HIM WITH HER FAN
GET THE DEEDS READY AS I SAID IN MY LAST
AS HE STOOD MEDITATING NEAR HIS WINDOW HE SAW THE POOR VICAR WITH SLOW LIMBS AND DOWNCAST COUNTENANCE WALK UNDER HIS LABURNUMS AND LAURUSTINUSES TOWARDS HIS LITTLE GATE AND SUDDENLY STOP AND TURN ROUND AND MAKE ABOUT A DOZEN QUICK STEPS LIKE A MAN WHO HAS FOUND A BRIGHT IDEA TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND THEN COME TO A THOUGHTFUL HALT AND SO TURN AND RECOMMENCE HIS SLOW MARCH OF DESPAIR HOMEWARD
WICKED MEN AND BRAVE AND SUFFERING WOMEN--THAT IS THE HISTORY OF OUR FAMILY--AND MEN AND WOMEN ALWAYS QUITE UNLIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD--UNLIKE THE HUMAN RACE
WHAT TREMENDOUS SELF-RELIANCE AND DISDAIN MUST FORM THE BASIS OF A FEMALE CHARACTER WHICH ACCEPTED MISAPPREHENSION AND DEPRECIATION WITH AN INDIFFERENCE SO GENUINE AS TO SCORN EVEN THE TRIFLING EXERTION OF DISCLOSING ITS POWERS
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THE DEVIL PUT SUCH STUFF IN YOUR HEAD
I WILL SPEAK TO MISS BRANDON WHEN SHE COMES DOWN
HALLO
I TRIED TO RECOLLECT ANYTHING PARTICULAR IN HIS MANNER--THERE WAS NOTHING
LEE SAYS HE SAW HIM AT CHARTERIS
AND WHEN WE JOINED THE LADIES IN THE DRAWING-ROOM THE GOOD VICAR'S ENTHUSIASTIC LITTLE WIFE CAME TO MEET US IN ONE OF HER HONEST LITTLE RAPTURES
AND TO HAVE GONE AWAY INTO OUTER DARKNESS WITH NO PROJECT ON THE STOCKS AND THE ATTORNEY'S COUNTENANCE AVERTED WOULD HAVE BEEN SIMPLY DESPAIR
I REGRET THE ENHANCED EXPENSE--I REGRET THE DELAY--I REGRET THE RISK--I REGRET IN FACT THE WHOLE SCENE
FOR SOME FRIENDLY VOICE AND HAND TO STAY HER THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH
YES SAID UNCLE LORNE LIFTING UP SLOWLY A DIFFERENT FINGER AT EACH NAME IN HIS CATALOGUE
I PEEPED INTO THE LIBRARY BUT HE WAS NOT THERE
THAT NIGHT A SPECTRE STOOD BY OLD TAMAR'S BEDSIDE IN SHAPE OF HER YOUNG MISTRESS AND SHOOK HER BY THE SHOULDER AND STOOPING SAID STERNLY CLOSE IN HER FACE TAMAR I'M GOING AWAY--ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS
HERE THEY ARE CRIED LAKE AND GRASPING THE FIRST MORNING PAPER HE COULD SEIZE ON HE TORE IT OPEN WITH A GREATER DISPLAY OF ENERGY THAN I HAD SEEN THAT LANGUID GENTLEMAN EXHIBIT ON ANY FORMER OCCASION
BUT THOUGH THE TYPE BEING SMALL HIS EYES WERE MORE PINK THAN BEFORE HE WAS NOTHING WISER THE INFORMATION BEING OF THAT NIGGARDLY HISTORICAL AND STATISTICAL KIND WHICH AVAILED NOTHING IN HIS PRESENT SCRUTINY
BUT NEITHER WOULD HE BE A GOOD HUSBAND THOUGH NOT SO BAD AS STANLEY
AT THE SAME TIME I HAD AN ODD SORT OF RELUCTANCE TO MENTION THE SUBJECT TO MY ENTERTAINERS
AND BEING SOMEWHAT THICK IN SOME MATTERS THOUGH A CUNNING FELLOW HE SAID YES
HE SOLEMNLY AVERRED THAT HE NEVER MEANT TO HAVE USED THE DAGGER EXCEPT TO DEFEND HIS LIFE
EXACTLY MY WISH MISS LAKE REPLIED MR JOS
SELL FIVE OAKS--THAT'S FOURTEEN HUNDRED A YEAR SAID HE
I THINK IN FACT HE WAS DESTITUTE OF THOSE FINE MORAL INSTINCTS WHICH ARE BORN WITH MEN BUT NEVER ACQUIRED
BUT HOW I SAY COULD I KNOW HE WAS SUCH A DEVIL
WHO--WHERE--MARK WYLDER NO
BUT I SUPPOSE HE DOES NOT LIKE YOU LESS FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED
FOR MY PART I HAVE DONE MY DUTY AND HERE AND NOW RENOUNCE ALL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE FUTURE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR AFFAIRS SAYING WHICH SHE ROSE IN A STATELY AND INCENSED WAY AND LOOKING WITH FLASHING EYES OVER DORCAS'S HEAD TO A FAR CORNER OF THE APARTMENT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD SHE RUSTLED SLOWLY AND MAJESTICALLY FROM THE DRAWING-ROOM
THIS LITTLE EXTEMPORISED BIVOUAC AS IT WERE WITH HER DOMESTICS DELIGHTED THE YOUNG BELLE
BUT THIS IS NO COMMON STRAIN UPON COURAGE RADIE
LARKIN ESQ THE LODGE BRANDON MANOR GYLINGDEN ON BEHALF OF HIS CLIENT THE REVEREND WILLIAM WYLDER
IN HIS COOL GRAND OFFICIAL WAY MR LARKIN REQUESTED MR EDWARDS TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE SILVER LION WHERE IN THE SAME CALM AND COMMANDING WAY HE DESIRED HIM TO ATTEND HIM TO VIEW THE CORPSE
MISS LAKE WAS NATURALLY PERFECTLY FRANK
THIRTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR--THE OLDEST FAMILY IN THE COUNTY--AND A STEADY THICK AND THIN SUPPORTER OF THE MINISTER
IT WAS ON THE UPPER LEVEL OF IT THAT SHE HAD HELD THAT CONFERENCE WITH STANLEY LAKE WHICH OBVIOUSLY REFERRED TO THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN'S TREATMENT OF THE VANISHED MARK
THAT MARK HAD SEEN SOME ONE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF GYLINGDEN A PERSON PRETENDING TO BE HIS WIFE OR SOME NEAR RELATIVE OF HERS AS WELL AS HE CAPTAIN LAKE COULD UNDERSTAND AND WAS RESOLVED TO GO TO LONDON PRIVATELY AND HAVE THE MATTER ARRANGED THERE
MAY I THEREFORE ASK AT THIS STAGE WHETHER THE REV
IT HAS INCREASED A LITTLE WITH INTEREST THOUGH GOOD MR MOUNTAIN NEVER CHARGED MORE THAN SIX PER CENT
WE CAME HERE TO A BALL
BUT TAKE NO STEP TILL I COME BACK SAID THE DOCTOR WHO HAD STUFFED A GREAT ROLL OF LINT AND PLAISTER AND SOME OTHER MEDICINALS INTO ONE POCKET AND HIS LEATHER CASE OF INSTRUMENTS FORCEPS PROBE SCISSORS AND ALL THE OTHER STEEL AND SILVER HORRORS INTO THE OTHER
BUT THE OSS SIR MUST AV IS OATS FUST FEED HIM HERE THEN
YES SIR WELL--OH
BUT IF SO IT IS A WORSHIP STRANGELY MIXED WITH CONTEMPT AND SHE LAUGHED A LITTLE
THESE INDEED WERE EVEN IN STANLEY'S CHILDHOOD OLD-WORLD HAZY TRADITIONS OF THE SERVANTS HALL
RELATING HOW I DROVE THROUGH THE VILLAGE OF GYLINGDEN WITH MARK WYLDER'S LETTER IN MY VALISE
MIND I SPELL IT WITH AN A NOT WITH AN E BUT HANG IT FOR AN ATTORNEY YOU KNOW AND SUCH A SHARP CHAP IT DOES SEEM TO ME RATHER A--A JOKE EH HE BEARS A GOOD CHARACTER AMONG THE TOWNSPEOPLE DOESN'T HE
AND I FIND MY OWN BUSINESS PRETTY NEARLY AS MUCH AS I CAN MANAGE
SHE SAW THE GLIMMER OF THE GOLD WATCH AND DISTINCTLY THE GREAT BLACK WHISKERS AND THE FACE PALLID IN THE MOONLIGHT
AND HAD FOR SOME YEARS KEPT UP A REGULAR CORRESPONDENCE WHICH FIRST GREW DESULTORY AND FINALLY AS MANHOOD SUPERVENED DIED OUT
I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE HOW GREAT WAS MY GUILT
I SHOULD CHANGE MY NAME SEAR MY FEATURES WITH VITRIOL AND LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE
I SUPPOSE HE EXPECTS TO BE ASKED TO THE WEDDING
THERE WAS A WAVING OF HANDS AND SMILES AND A SHOUTED BEAUTIFUL DAY WHAT A POSITION THAT POOR FELLOW HAS GOT HIMSELF INTO GOOD MR LARKIN THOUGHT WITH A SHRUG OF COMPASSION TO HIMSELF
I DON'T SEE MISS BRANDON THAT MY THOUGHTS UPON THAT SUBJECT CAN CONCERN ANYONE BUT MYSELF RETORTED THE OLD LADY SEVERELY AND FROM AN AWFUL ALTITUDE
UPON THIS ON LORD CHELFORD'S MOTION IN OUR FORLORN CONDITION WE WENT TO THE BILLIARD-ROOM AND THERE UNDER THE BRIGHT LIGHTS AND THE GAY INFLUENCE OF THAT WONDERFUL GAME WE FORGOT OUR CARES AND BECAME EXCELLENT FRIENDS APPARENTLY--'CUTS CANONS SCREWS MISSES FLUKES'--LORD CHELFORD JOKED WYLDER CHAFFED EVEN LAKE SEEMED TO ENJOY HIMSELF
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE MA'AM WRITE AND PROMISE IF YOU SEND FOR HER SHE SHALL GET THE NOTE SO DOLLY MADE THE PROMISE AND BRINGING OLD TAMAR WITH HER INTO THE STUDY PENNED THESE ODD LINES FROM HER DICTATION MERELY ADJUSTING THE GRAMMAR
AND THAT ONE CUP OF WINE"--YOU RECOLLECT--WHICH THE HERO DRANK
HE WAS NOT BUSY ABOUT HIS PLATE NOR BALANCING THE CELLAR BOOK NOR EVEN PERUSING HIS BIBLE
CAPTAIN LAKE OVERTOOK HIM AND HE GOT IN AND WAS DRIVEN TO DOLLINGTON WHERE HE TOOK THE UP-TRAIN
AND I DON'T FLATTER HER
MISS LAKE HAD SHE SUPPOSED HER OWN NOTIONS AND WOULD ACT AS SHE PLEASED
THOSE LITTLE TRIPS TO TOWN PAID VERY FAIRLY
I ALMOST FANCY THESE GYLINGDEN PEOPLE DULL AS THEY ARE MUST OBSERVE IT
I DARE SAY--EH THE MAJOR'S SOUL WAS AT THE DOLLINGTON STATION AND WAS REGULATING POOR LAKE'S DEPARTURE BY BRADSHAW'S GUIDE WHO KNOWS
CERTAINLY STANLEY LAKE WAS RIGHT ABOUT REDMAN'S DELL
FOR YOU KNOW IF POOR MARK IS DEAD THEN WOULD NOT HE HAVE THE ESTATE NOW
THAT'S THE WAY THEY KEEP HOLIDAY
POOR STANLEY
C
I CAME TO SEE MY BROTHER YOU ARE FRANK AT ALL EVENTS RACHEL AND TRUTH IS BETTER THAN COURTESY
SO THAT D--D FELLOW LAKE IS DOWN HERE STILL
HOW THE
YOU ARE CORRESPONDING WITH HIM--AREN'T YOU I'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW THAT IS CAPTAIN LAKE
HOW SOON WILL THE DOCTOR BE HERE FROM A QUARTER TO HALF AN HOUR MY LORD THEN TELL THE HOUSEKEEPER TO ARRANGE AS SHE PROPOSES AND DON'T REMOVE HIS CLOTHES UNTIL THE DOCTOR COMES
BUT A GRAIN OF WHEAT WILL BRING FORTH NO FRUIT UNLESS IT DIE FIRST
AND IN A STATE OF SUPERNATURAL DISMAY HE FELT FOR A WHILE DISPOSED TO KILL HIMSELF
I READ THIS PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE HALF A DOZEN TIMES OVER DURING BREAKFAST
HERE I AM WELL LET ME GO
I'VE PAID AWAY ALL I COULD AND GIVEN BILLS FOR THE REST
THINK THEN WHAT IT WAS WHEN MR PUMMICE OF COPAL AND PUMMICE THE SPLENDID HOUSE-PAINTERS AT DOLLINGTON ARRIVED WITH HIS ARTISTS AND CHARWOMEN TO GIVE THE ASSEMBLY ROOM ITS ANNUAL TOUCHING-UP AND BEDIZENMENT PREPARATORY TO THE HUNT BALL
DEAR NO--NOT THAT I SEE ANY ESSENTIAL HARM IN THE GAME AS A GAME FOR THOSE I MEAN WHO DON'T OBJECT TO THAT SORT OF THING
AND HAVING AS IT WERE SECURED ITS AWFUL COMMAND OVER ME BY A PROTRACTED GAZE HE ROSE SUPERNATURALLY LEAN AND TALL AND DREW NEAR THE SIDE OF MY BED
THERE WAS SOMETHING TOO IN THE TONE AND LOOK OF CAPTAIN LAKE WHICH WENT A GOOD WAY TO CONFOUND AND PERPLEX HIS SUSPICIONS AND HE HALF FANCIED THAT THE MASTERSTROKE HE HAD HAZARDED WAS A RANK AND IRREPARABLE BLUNDER
AND YOU HAVE GOT MY AGREEMENT SIGNED PARDON ME CAPTAIN BRANDON LAKE
YOU MUST SEE MY DEAR SIR WITH SUCH RUMOURS POSSIBLY ABOUT TO GET AFLOAT AND SUCH PERSONS ABOUT TO APPEAR AS THIS JAMES DUTTON THAT MATTERS ARE REALLY GROWING CRITICAL AND THERE'S NO LACK OF ABLE SOLICITORS WHO WOULD ON SPECULATION UNDERTAKE A SUIT UPON LESS EVIDENCE PERHAPS THAN MAY BE FORTHCOMING TO UPSET YOUR TITLE UNDER THE WILL THROUGH MRS DORCAS BRANDON LAKE--YOUR JOINT TITLE--IN FAVOUR OF THE REVERSIONER LAKE ONLY BIT HIS LIP AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
ONLY AN ENQUIRY ABOUT THEM FEW SHARES ANSWERED MR LARCOM WITH ANOTHER SERENE REVERENCE AND REMAINING STANDING HAT IN HAND AT THE DOOR
WILLIAM WYLDER I AM SO GLAD I'M IN TIME SAID RACHEL RUSTLING ACROSS THE ROOM
BURLINGTON AND SMITH WERE IN FACT A VERY SHARP HOUSE
THE DAY APPOINTED FOR THE NUPTIALS WAS NOW VERY NEAR AND THE BRIDEGROOM NOT ONLY OUT OF SIGHT BUT WHOLLY UNTRACEABLE
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED--BUT HE'S ALIVE
AND HE SAID ALL AT ONCE WITH A SUDDEN ACCESSION OF ENERGY AND AN UNPLEASANT MOMENTARY GLARE IN HIS EYES YOU KNOW RACHEL THIS SORT OF THING IS ALL NONSENSE
AND RACHEL RAISED HER EYES AND WHISPERED AN AGITATED THANKSGIVING
I RATHER DISLIKE IT BECAUSE MARK WANTS TO KEEP IT QUIET
DORCAS TURNED IN HER GRAND WAY AND WALKED SLOWLY TOWARD THE DOOR
BURNING BENEATH HER FEELING ABOUT IT WAS NOW A DEEP-ROOTED ANGER AND JEALOUSY
THE SUN JUST TOUCHED THE VERGE OF THE WOODED UPLANDS AS THE YOUNG PEOPLE BEGAN TO DESCEND THE SLOPE OF REDMAN'S DELL
SO WYLDER HAS RUN UP TO TOWN I SAID SO SOON AS WE HAD SHAKEN HANDS IN THE HALL
MAYBE MARK WYLDER IS MAD AND WANDERING IN CHARGE OF A KEEPER
AND HERE'S MY CHECK FOR 50_L WHICH YOU CAN SEND--OR PERHAPS I HAD BETTER SEND BY THIS NIGHT'S POST--TO THOSE CAMBRIDGE PEOPLE
YES IT WAS A STUPENDOUS SECRET
AND THE QUIET OF THE ROAD AND THE SWEET AIR AND SUNSHINE TEMPTED HIM TO WALK OFF THE CHILL AND FEVER OF THE FIT
BUT I DO NOT RESENT--IT IS NOT MY WAY--"BEARETH ALL THINGS MISS LAKE BEARETH ALL THINGS"--I HOPE I TRY TO PRACTISE THE PRECEPT
YOU WON'T DO IT--BUT YOU CAN AND WILL PRACTISE ALL THE AIRS AND FOOLERIES OF A BAD MELODRAMA
WHAT FRIGHTENED HIM WAS THE CERTAINTY THAT THE STEP WHICH HE WELL KNEW WAS STANLEY LAKE'S
THEY--THEY REPEATED CAPTAIN LAKE
IT IS PASSING AWAY HER COLOUR WAS RETURNING AND WITH A SHIVERING SIGH SHE SAID OH
YES--YELLOW--QUITE PERFECT SAID STANLEY
THE LIMITATIONS LET ME SEE IS NOT THERE SOMETHING THAT ONE MIGHT BE SAFE IN ADVANCING A TRIFLE UPON--EH?--H'M--YES AND WITH HIS LIP IN HIS FINGER AND THUMB HE CONNED OVER THOSE REMAINDERS AND REVERSIONS WITH A SKILLED AND RAPID EYE
NOW DORCAS MIND THERE MUST BE NO TRIFLING
THE UP TRAINS FROM DOLLINGTON WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND THAT DIDDLED CRUTCHLEIGH WOULD BE DOWN ON HIM THE MOMENT THE BREATH WAS OUT OF POOR LAKE
SUPPOSE SOME FINE DAY HE SHOULD PUT HIS HAND OVER THE PALING AND TAKE YOURS AND MAKE YOU A SPEECH YOU ROMANTIC DARLING SHE SAID DON'T YOU KNOW THAT PEERS AND PRINCES HAVE QUITE GIVEN OVER MARRYING SIMPLE MAIDENS OF LOW ESTATE FOR LOVE AND LIKING AND UNDERSTAND MATCH-MAKING BETTER THAN YOU OR I
WILL YOU COME WITH ME FOR A DRIVE RADIE SHE ASKED
HOWEVER ON THE WHOLE IT WAS BEST TO OBEY MARK WYLDER'S ORDERS AND ACCORDINGLY GALIGNANI SAID
SO THE GIRL DRIED HER HANDS--SHE WAS WASHING THE TEACUPS--AND IN A TWINKLING WAS EQUIPPED AND ON HER WAY TO GYLINGDEN
THE ORIGINAL LINES WERE NOT PREPOSSESSING
I WAS QUIETLY INCENSED AND DISGUSTED
AND SO OUR DINNER-LIST IS FULL
PURSUE YOUR OWN PLOTS--YOUR WICKED PLOTS
THERE APPEARS TO BE A CONCERT GOING ON
AND THIS POINT CLEARLY SETTLED I AVOWED MYSELF A LITTLE TIRED
IF THE FELLOW KNEW THAT HIS FIXED STARE WAS OBSERVED THROUGH HIS NARROW EMBRASURE--AND LARKIN THOUGHT HE COULD HARDLY BE INSENSIBLE TO THE REPROOF OF HIS RETURN FIRE--HE MUST BE A PARTICULARLY IMPERTINENT PERSON
AND ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THE LOAN WAS SURE TO COME THE DELAY--ANY DELAY IN HIS SITUATION--WAS CRITICAL AND FORMIDABLE
HE TAPPED--OR RATHER BEAT ON THE PANE WITH HIS FINGERS--AND AT THE SAME TIME HE SAID REPEATEDLY
THEN THERE WOULD BE INSURANCES IN PROPORTION
THE DREADFUL CONFIDENCE WOULD BE MORE TERRIBLE FROM ANY OTHER
IT WAS HARDLY REASONABLE
ALL THE DATA EXCEPT THE MUSTER-ROLL OF ELECTORS WERE IN NUBIBUS_--WHO WOULD RETIRE--WHO WOULD STEP FORWARD AS YET ALTOGETHER IN THE REGION OF CONJECTURE
BUT I THINK I SHOULD HARDLY BE DOING MY DUTY IF I WERE NOT TO WARN YOU THAT YOU WILL DO WISELY TO EXHIBIT NO HESITATION IN THE ARRANGEMENTS BY WHICH YOUR AGREEMENT IS TO BE CARRIED OUT AND THAT IN THE EVENT OF YOUR SHOWING THE SLIGHTEST DISPOSITION TO QUALIFY THE SPIRIT OF YOUR STRONG NOTE TO THEM OR IN ANYWISE DISAPPOINTING THEIR CLIENT YOU MUST BE PREPARED FROM WHAT I KNOW OF THE FIRM FOR VERY SHARP PRACTICE INDEED WHAT COULD THEY DO TO HIM OR WHY SHOULD THEY HURT HIM OR WHAT HAD HE DONE TO EXCITE EITHER THE SUSPICION OR THE TEMPER OF THE FIRM
THERE MASTER STANLEY FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN--YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SPEAK OF
YOUR LORDSHIP'S VERY GOOD AND THE WINE I MAY SAY EXCELLENT--DELICIOUS CLARET
YOU'RE MAD SIR SAID THE ATTORNEY DISENGAGING HIMSELF WITH A SUDDEN AND VIOLENT EFFORT AND STANDING WITH THE BACK OF A TALL CHAIR GRASPED IN BOTH HANDS AND THE SEAT INTERPOSED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND CAPTAIN LAKE
YOU NEED NOT LOOK SO PALE
DID YOU DID NOT YOU KNOW I WAS THERE SAID LAKE IN RATHER A CHANGED TONE
THE MONEY CAREFULLY COUNTED WAS ROLLED IN LAKE'S POCKET BOOK AND THE BRIGHT NEW DEED WHICH MADE JOS
CAPTAIN LAKE PUT IT IN HIS PALETOT POCKET LOOKED IN HER FACE GENTLY AND SMILED AND THANKED HER IN HIS GRACEFUL WAY--AND IN FACT LEFT AN ENDURING IMPRESSION UPON THAT IMPRESSIBLE NATURE
HE FELT HIS PULSE
DEEP IN THIS PICTURESQUE RAVINE BURIED AMONG THE THICK SHADOWS OF TALL OLD TREES RUNS THE NARROW MILL-ROAD WHICH LOWER DOWN DEBOUCHES ON THE END OF THE VILLAGE STREET
GLIDING WITHOUT NOISE FROM PLACE TO PLACE SHE PACKED A SMALL BLACK LEATHER BAG WITH A FEW NECESSARY ARTICLES
FOR THAT IS DELIVERED UNTO ME AND TO WHOMSOEVER I WILL I GIVE IT THE WORLD BELONGS TO THE RASCALS
WHATEVER MAY BE THE CAUSE OF MARK WYLDER'S PRESENT LINE OF CONDUCT IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IF HE REALLY DID ATTEND THAT MEETING AT THE MILLER'S HALL THERE CANNOT BE ANYTHING VERY SERIOUS WEIGHING UPON HIS SPIRITS
BY GEORGE SIR THEY'VE BEEN AT MISCHIEF BURST FORTH THE MAJOR
OBJECTION
THAT IS PRECISELY AS I SAID
THIS WON'T DO HE MUTTERED
BUT HE HAD A PASSIONATE SORT OF OBSTINACY AND HIS WHIMS TOOK A VIOLENT CHARACTER WHEN THEY WERE CROSSED AND HE WAS ANGRY AND JEALOUS AND UNINTELLIGIBLE REMINDING ONE OF CARLYLE'S DESCRIPTION OF PHILIP EGALITE--A CHAOS
IT IS WONDERFUL THAT SHE SHOWED HER STATE OF MIND SO LITTLE
AND IS NOT IT TRUE--IS NOT IT CRUEL--IS NOT IT FRIGHTFUL TO GO ON YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE AWARE MY GOOD TAMAR THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING SLANDER ALL THIS WHILE AND MIGHT BE SENT TO GAOL FOR IT
HAD YOU NOT BETTER GO DOWN AND SPEAK TO YOUR FRIEND IN THE WATER YOUNG MAN I BLESS YOU FOR REMEMBERING SAID UNCLE LORNE SOLEMNLY
SO AS SHE WORKED SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES AND BEHELD A RATHER HANDSOME YOUNG MAN STANDING AT THE LITTLE WICKET OF HER GARDEN WITH HIS GLOVED HAND ON THE LATCH
AND SO ALL THINGS FAVOURING
THINGS HAVE NOT GONE QUITE SMOOTH WITH ME SINCE
AND THAT HE UNDERSTOOD LARKIN HAD SOME LIGHTS TO THROW UPON THE SAME SUBJECT
HE HAD A LIKING FOR LONG SERMONS AND A SAD ABHORRENCE OF AMUSEMENTS AND SAT OUT THE MORNING AND THE EVENING SERVICES REGULARLY--AND KEPT UP HIS DISSENTING CONNECTION TOO AND GAVE THEM MONEY--AND APPEARED IN PRINT IN ALL CHARITABLE LISTS--AND MOURNED OVER OTHER MEN'S BACKSLIDINGS AND CALAMITIES IN A LOFTY AND CHRISTIAN WAY SHAKING HIS TALL BALD HEAD AND TURNING UP HIS PINK EYES MILDLY
THE WHOLE PARTY EXCEPT RACHEL WERE AGHAST
IF I THOUGHT THERE COULD BE ANYTHING THE LEAST WRONG OR REPREHENSIBLE--WE ARE ALL FALLIBLE--IN MY ALLOWING MY MIND TO TURN SO MUCH UPON MY CLIENT I CAN CERTAINLY SAY I SHOULD BE VERY FAR FROM ALLOWING IT--I SHALL CERTAINLY CONSIDER IT--AND I MAY PROMISE MYSELF TO DECIDE IN A CHRISTIAN SPIRIT AND IF THERE BE A DOUBT TO GIVE IT AGAINST MYSELF THIS RESOLUTION WHICH WAS HE TRUSTED THAT OF A RIGHTEOUS MAN WAS I AM AFRAID THE EFFECT RATHER OF FRIGHT THAN REFLECTION AND EMPLOYED IN THAT SENSE SOMEWHAT IN THE MANNER OF AN EXORCISM--WHISPERED RATHER TO THE GHOST THAN TO HIS CONSCIENCE
MY MOTHER COULD TELL US ALL ABOUT IT--WE BRANDONS LAKES
DEAR RADIE EVERY MAN WHO HAS EVER BEEN ON TERMS OF INTIMACY WITH ANOTHER MUST KNOW THINGS TO HIS DISADVANTAGE BUT NO ONE THINKS OF TELLING THEM
AYE AYE--ANOTHER TIME--SOME NIGHT THERE'S AURORA BOREALIS IN THE SKY
DEAR CHARLIE EVER MOST SINCERELY YOUR OLD FRIEND MARK WYLDER
MY ONLY BROTHER
LARCOM MARK'S ON LEAVE TO-NIGHT IN UNIFORM
THE CAPTAIN HAD BUTTONED THE COLLAR OF HIS LOOSE COAT ACROSS HIS FACE AND IT WAS DARK BESIDE
IT IS ONLY A LIFE ESTATE WELL PERHAPS SO
WHERE IS THE WOMAN WHO WILL PATIENTLY ACQUIESCE IN THE RESERVE OF HER HUSBAND WHO SHARES HIS CONFIDENCE WITH ANOTHER
IT IS INCREDIBLE
YOU MUST PROCURE ABLE ADVICE AT ONCE
AND I BEGINNING TO GROW VERY DROWSY WAS NOT LONG IN GETTING TO BED WHERE I FELL ASLEEP INDESCRIBABLY QUICKLY
BEG YOUR PARDON SIR
AND I WANT YOU TO SHAKE HANDS AND MAKE HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND DRAW HIM OUT--DO YOU SEE
SO HAVING ENDED ALL THESE STUDIES THE ATTORNEY LIFTED UP HIS EYES AGAIN AS HE LOWERED HIS NEWSPAPER AND BEHELD THE SAME GLITTERING GAZE FIXED UPON HIM THROUGH THE SAME HORIZONTAL CRANNY
IT WAS NEAR TWELVE O'CLOCK WHEN LORD CHELFORD SAW MISS BRANDON
AND THE MORE HE LOOKED THE MORE HE FELT DISPOSED TO LOOK
STILL THERE WAS THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES OVER HIS PINEAL GLAND
HE DID NOT SHOW MUCH
LARKIN HAD SOMETHING OF THE RED INDIAN'S FACULTY FOR TRACKING HIS GAME BY HARDLY PERCEPTIBLE SIGNS AND TOKENS THROUGH THE WILDERNESS
THERE IS NO PRIVACY LIKE IT
THE TIME HAD NOW ARRIVED WHEN OUR FRIEND JOS
NEXT DAY IT WAS RESOLVED THE CAPTAIN'S PERSONAL CANVASS WAS TO COMMENCE
WHATEVER YOU MEDITATE HE PROBABLY ANTICIPATES IT--YOU KNOW BEST--AND YOU WILL FIND HIM PREPARED
AND--AND BESIDES I HATE HIM WHAT D--D NONSENSE
THE PASSAGE WAS EMPTY AND ENDED IN UTTER DARKNESS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK
AND MORE OR LESS HIS LITTLE MIND CONTINUED WANDERING UNTIL NEAR SIX WHEN HE FELL INTO A SOUND SLEEP AND SEEMED BETTER FOR IT
YOU MUST NOT LEAVE ME TO-NIGHT
WOULD IT NOT BE A MORE CONVENIENT COURSE AS WELL AS MORE MERCIFUL TO PUT HIM TO DEATH
AND MARGERY POPPED HER CLOAK ON HER SHOULDERS AND THE YOUNG LADY PULLED ON HER GLOVES
YES WE SOMETIMES CONJECTURE RIGHT AND SOMETIMES WRONG
AND YOU HAVE QUITE CEASED TO LOVE ME
I'VE JUST HEARD IN THE OTHER ROOM FROM YOUR WIFE WILLIAM WYLDER THAT YOU WERE ABOUT SELLING YOUR REVERSION IN THE ESTATES AND I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER THAT IS SO
THIS LOOK WAS BUT ONCE AND MOMENTARY
I SEE IT ALL NOW SHE WHISPERED
SO CHELFORD LED STANLEY LAKE BEFORE THE LADY OF THE CASTLE
AND HE DREW HIS FACE ASIDE AMONG THE JESSAMINE WHEN HE SAW THE GAUNT ATTORNEY DIRECTING HIS PATRONISING SMILE UPON HIM
YOU CERTAINLY ARE IN DANGER--_GREAT DANGER LAKE BECAME INDESCRIBABLY AGITATED AND UTTERED SOME WORDS NOT OFTEN ON HIS LIPS THAT SOUNDED LIKE DESPERATE WORDS OF SUPPLICATION
THE TRAIN--THE IMAGE UPON EARTH OF THE IRREVOCABLE THE IRRETRIEVABLE--WAS GONE NEITHER TO BE OVERTAKEN NOR RECALLED
P.S.--I STAY AT THE BRANDON ARMS IN THE TOWN UNTIL AFTER THE MARRIAGE
AND ONE PERSON STILL IN HIS DAILY COSTUME
POOR DEVIL I'M AFRAID HE'LL DO NO GOOD THE LADIES THAT MORNING HAD TEA IN THEIR ROOMS
MY CIGAR CASE WAS A RESOURCE
NOW YOU KNOW WHAT EVEN MODERATE SUCCESS IN THE HOUSE WHEN FAMILY AND PROPERTY GO TOGETHER MAY ACCOMPLISH
OLD TAMAR IS A SENSIBLE CREATURE AS SHE ALWAYS WAS
BUT NO ILL-WILL--NO MALEVOLENCE IN VICTORY--NO SOURNESS IN DEFEAT
I THOUGHT I HEARD HIM CALL THE YOUNG LADY MISS LAKE AND THERE ROSE BEFORE ME AN IMAGE OF AN OLD GENERAL LAKE AND A DIM RECOLLECTION OF SOME REVERSE OF FORTUNE
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS TO BE SAID
AND SAYS YOU TO ME MISS IT'S ALL ABOUT MASTER STANLEY
AND WITH HIS CANE MADE A SMACKING LIKE A HARLEQUIN'S SWORD UPON THE OLD WOMAN'S DEAL TABLE CRYING
CAN YOU GIVE ME TWO HOURS TO-MORROW EVENING--SAY TO TEA--IF YOU WILL DO ME THE HONOUR
NO I TAKE LEAVE TO THINK HE CERTAINLY DOES NOT
HERE I STAND FOREWARNED WITH MY EYES OPEN DETERMINEDLY FOLLOWING IN THE FUNEREAL FOOTSTEPS OF THOSE WHO HAVE GONE THEIR WAY BEFORE ME
SO THEN IT HAD COME AND GONE--GONE FOR EVER
HOW IS IT THAT THEY FAIL TO SEE QUITE THROUGH ONE JOS
AH--ALL RIGHT I WAS FORGETTING
YOU ARE A VERY AMUSING BROTHER--IF NOT A VERY CHEERY OR A VERY USEFUL ONE STANLEY SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND CALLED ACROSS THE LITTLE HALL INTO THE HOMELY KITCHEN OF THE MANSION
I SAW THEM PLAY THAT MATCH AT BRIGHTON I MENTIONED JUST NOW A FEW DAYS AGO AH
WHAT CAN THE CHILD MEAN DO YOU THINK LADY CHELFORD IT MAY BE SAFELY CONTRACTED SOLELY TO JOIN TWO ESTATES PURSUED THE YOUNG LADY
AND OH
AND OH
AND OH
POOR WILLIAM WYLDER HAD THOSE SPECIAL TROUBLES WHICH HAUNT NERVOUS TEMPERAMENTS AND SPECULATIVE MINDS WHEN UNDER THE SOLEMN INFLUENCE OF RELIGION
HER BACK WAS TOWARDS US AND SHE HELD THE LETTER IN HER HAND AS IF READING IT BUT HER LARGE EYES WERE LOOKING OVER IT AND ON US IN THE GLASS WITH A GAZE OF STRANGE CURIOSITY
BUT HE'LL NEVER MAKE A SERVANT FOR YOU--HE'S A ROUGH CREATURE SHE SAYS AND WAS A GROOM
AND NOW STANLEY LAKE DREW UP IN THE TAX-CART AND GREETED THE LADIES AND TOLD THEM HOW HE MEANT TO PASS THE DAY
DORCAS MET HER AT THE DOOR AND THEY KISSED SILENTLY
SO HE STRUTTED FORTH IN HIS GREAT COAT UNNATURALLY BROAD ABOUT THE HIPS
YOU'RE SURPRISED TO SEE ME HERE HE SAID IN HIS VERY PLEASING LOW TONES
QUITE STRAIGHT SIR REPEATED STANLEY LAKE LOOKING ROUND ON HIM STERNLY
BUT YOU ARE SO LIKE MY POOR DEAR UNCLE LANGTON
VAIN TO CONJECTURE FOR WHAT STATION THAT TRAVELLER IN THE BATTERED HAT WAS BOUND
I LIKE TO CALL YOU COUSIN--KINDRED IS SO PLEASANT
IT IS VAIN REASONING WITH THAT WHICH IS NOT REASON
TOLD HIM THAT LORD CHELFORD HAD SHE SUPPOSED NO IDEA OF MARRYING OUT OF HIS OWN RANK
IT IS ONLY RIGHT IS FAMILY SHUD KNOW ALL AND HIS SAD ENDING--WICH I WILL TELL BEFORE YOU SIR IN FULL ACCORDEN TO MY BEST GUESS AS BIN THE FAMILY LAWYER AND SIR YOU WILL FIND IT USFUL TO TELL THIS IN SECRET TO CAPTEN LAKE OF BRANDON HALL--BUT NOT ON NO ACCOUNT TO ANY OTHER IT IS ORRIBLE SIR TO THINK A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WITH EVERYTHING THE WORLD CAN GIVE SHUD BE MADE AWAY WITH SO CREWEL IN THE DARK
BUT NO IT WAS TOO TALL FOR THAT
AND SITTING DOWN SHE LEANED HER HEAD ON HER HAND WITH A MOAN THE LIVING PICTURE OF DESPAIR
THE GOOD VICAR WAS NOT ONLY DISMAYED BUT ENDANGERED BY HIS BROTHER'S PROTRACTED ABSENCE
FIRST LUCUS MORTIS
IT WAS NOW THE FIRST WEEK IN NOVEMBER
AND WAS WITH THE USUAL FATALITY A BIT OF A MAUVAIS SUJET
THERE WAS NO LONGER LIGHT TO READ BY
YOU MAKE YOURSELF NERVOUS THAT WAY
IN THE MEANWHILE ON HIS RETURN TO THE LIBRARY LORD CHELFORD FOUND HIS DOWAGER MOTHER IN HIGH CHAT WITH THE ATTORNEY WHOM SHE AFTERWARDS PRONOUNCED A VERY GENTLEMANLIKE MAN FOR HIS LINE OF LIFE THE CONVERSATION INDEED WAS CHIEFLY THAT OF LADY CHELFORD THE EXEMPLARY ATTORNEY CONTRIBUTING FOR THE MOST PART A POLITE ACQUIESCENCE AND THOSE REFLECTIONS WHICH MOST APPOSITELY POINTED THE MORAL OF HER LADYSHIP'S TALE WHICH CONCERNED ALTOGETHER THE VAGARIES OF MARK WYLDER--A SUBJECT WHICH PIQUED HER CURIOSITY AND IRRITATED HER PASSIONS
IN A MOMENT--IN A MOMENT SAID THE LAWYER SIGNALLING TO HIM TO BE QUIET AS LOFTILY AS IF CHAPEL HALL AND SEXTON WERE HIS PRIVATE PROPERTY
WAS IT SUSPICION
BUT RUDDLE HAD SEEN MR JOS
WHY IS THAT FELLOW SO SUPINE
AND IF HE HAD NO SUCH INTENTION AND WERE AS FREE AS YOU ARE AND AGAIN TO URGE HIS FOOLISH SUIT UPON HIS KNEES STANLEY I WOULD DIE RATHER THAN ACCEPT HIM IT WAS NOT ALWAYS SO FOOLISH A SUIT RADIE ANSWERED HER BROTHER HIS EYES ONCE MORE UPON THE CARPET
NO MORE PRATTLING AT UNSEASONABLE TIMES--NO MORE CRYING--NO MORE SINGING--NO MORE LAUGHING
AND ON THE FINGER AS I AFTERWARDS SAW AT THE INQUEST GLIMMERED THE TALISMANIC LEGEND RESURGAM--I WILL RISE AGAIN IT WAS THE CORPSE OF MARK WYLDER WHICH HAD LAIN BURIED HERE UNDISCOVERED FOR MANY MONTHS
SHE'S KILLED
HE HAD NOT MOVED ALL THIS WHILE
AND WHEN EVERYTHING WENT SMOOTHLY WERE DULL AND DOVE-LIKE BUT WHEN THINGS CROSSED OR EXCITED HIM WHICH OCCURRED WHEN HIS OWN POCKET OR PLANS WERE CONCERNED THEY GREW SINGULARLY UNPLEASANT AND GREATLY RESEMBLED THOSE OF SOME NOT AMIABLE ANIMAL--WAS IT A RAT OR A SERPENT
YOU MUST TAKE OFF YOUR THINGS AND STAY
AND OWE IT TO US ALL TO APPEAR NOW AND THEN IN THIS UPPER WORLD EXCELSIOR MISS LAKE INTERPOSED DAPPER LITTLE MR BUTTLE WITH A SMIRK
WHAT COULD OLD TAMAR DO
HAPPY THAT MOMENT--THAT ENCHANTED MOMENT OF OBLIVION AND ILLUSION
SO WITH PERMISSION UP HE JUMPED BEHIND AND AWAY THEY WHIRLED CLOSE OVER THE GROUND ON TOY WHEELS RINGING MERRILY ON THE SHINGLE HE LEANING OVER THE BACK AND CHATTING PLEASANTLY WITH THE YOUNG LADIES AS THEY DROVE ON
SO PRAY DON'T REFUSE
HE'S AS EASILY FRIGHTENED AS A FISH AND UNCLE LORNE CREPT DOWN THE BANK TACKING AND DODGING AND ALL THE TIME LAUGHING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF
THE ATTORNEY HAD NO PLEASURE IN DOING PEOPLE ILL TURNS
BUT I ARRIVED HERE THIS MORNING
HOW STUPID HOW COULD I TELL HE WAS SUCH A FIEND I TOLD YOU HOW IT WOULD BE
SO I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE QUITE RESOLVED ON
HE COULD NOT STAND BEING BROUGHT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOWN
MASTER STANLEY MY CHILD RACHEL WENT INTO THE PARLOUR AND KNEELED DOWN WITH WHITE UPTURNED FACE AND CLASPED HANDS
AND HE MADE A VERY PRETTY CORPSE WHEN HE WAS LAID OUT AND HIS GOLDEN HAIR LOOKED SO NICE AND HE WAS ALL SO SLIM AND SHAPELY
BEEN IN CALCUTTA LAKE NO
WHAT DOES HE SAY SO MARK'S GONE TO TOWN HE SAID
WITH ONE OF THE CANDLES IN HIS HAND HE WENT OUT AND MADE A HURRIED PEEPING EXPLORATION AND SOON FOR THE ROOMS WERE QUICKLY COUNTED IN REDMAN'S FARM HE FOUND HER CHAMBER SMALL NEAT SIMPLEX MUNDITIIS
THE SAME GENTLE VOICE WITH THAT SLIGHT OCCASIONAL HESITATION WHICH SOMEHOW I LIKED
DEAR LITTLE FAIRY--WHERE IS HE ASKED RACHEL HER SAD EYES LOOKING TOWARD THE DOOR
AND HAS NO MORE CONSCIENCE THAN THAT AND HE TOUCHED HIS FINGER TO THE COLD SUMMIT OF A MARBLE BUST
THE VICAR'S TROUBLES GREW AND GATHERED AS SUCH TROUBLES WILL
BUT CUNNING AS HE IS I THINK I'VE QUITE SEEN THROUGH HIS PLOT
YOU MUST KNOW DORKIE THAT BEFORE HIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE MARK WYLDER PROMISED TO LEND WILLIAM HIS BROTHER A SUM SUFFICIENT TO RELIEVE HIM OF ALL HIS PRESSING DEBTS DEBTS
STOP THAT HYPOCRITICAL GRIMACING WILL YOU
PART OF THE PERIWIG AND CHEEK OF SIR MARCUS BRANDON STILL GLIMMERED WHITISH AS AT A LITTLE DISTANCE DID ALSO THE DIM MARBLE FACE AND ARM OF THE YOUNG COUNTESS OF LYDINGWORTH MOURNING THESE HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS OVER HER DEAD BABY
IF YOU HAVE HEARD FROM HIM WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS PERHAPS YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS TO SEND ME THE ENVELOPE OF HIS LETTER WHICH BY ITS POSTMARK MAY POSSIBLY THROW SOME LIGHT OR HINT SOME THEORY AS TO HIS POSSIBLE MOVEMENTS
AYE SO IT IS SURE!--AND SUCH IT WAS AND WILL BE
HOW ARE YOU LAKE
THERE IS A LITTLE ANNUITY CHARGED ON SIR HUGH LANDON'S ESTATE AND HIS SOLICITOR HAS WRITTEN OFFERING ME SIX HUNDRED POUNDS FOR IT
LARKIN WAS LOCKING THE DESPATCH BOX WHICH WAS TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO LONDON MR LARCOM ARRIVED AT THE LODGE
BY GEORGE IT WAS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CASE HE HAD EVER MET WITH
CHAPTER XLIII
THE DOCTOR WILL MAKE HIS VISIT IMMEDIATELY AND THEN WE CAN ASK HIM
I AM SO GLAD RADIE DEAR YOU ARE COME
HE HAD A NOTE FOR MR LARKIN'S HAND WHICH HE MUST HIMSELF DELIVER
AND TELLS ME THAT CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE IS THINKING OF STANDING EITHER FOR THE COUNTY OR FOR DOLLINGTON
BUT THANK HEAVEN DOCTOR BUDDLE SAYS THERE'S NOTHING TO MAKE US AT ALL UNEASY
WAPSIE YOUR HANDS WOULD BE COLD AND HE HELD THE GLOVES TO HIM AGAINST THE GLASS
AND BEFORE HE HAD REACHED THE END OF THE PLATFORM THE CARRIAGE WINDOWS WERE FLYING BY HIM WITH THE SPEED OF WHEEL-SPOKES AND THE END OF THE COUPE WITH ITS RED LANTERN SAILED AWAY THROUGH THE CUTTING
I WILL WRITE TO-NIGHT ACCEPTING THAT OFFER AND YOU SHALL HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY THOSE DEBTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PRESSING SO MISERABLY UPON YOU
ALL SIR WELL AND--AND LET ME GIVE YOU A GLASS OF SHERRY MR LARCOM AFTER YOUR WALK
PEOPLE MUST LOVE AND SYMPATHISE VERY THOROUGHLY I THINK TO ENJOY NATURAL SCENERY TOGETHER
BUT HIS BRAIN WAS APPALLED AND HIS HEART DIED WITHIN HIM IN THE UNSPEAKABLE HORROR OF DEATH
AND I FELT A NATURAL DESIRE TO ESCAPE FROM THE HOUSE WHICH WAS PLAGUED WITH ITS PRESENCE
AND ASK THE DOCTOR NOW FROM ME HOW HE THINKS CAPTAIN LAKE IN A LITTLE WHILE THE MAID RETURNED
WHY DOES MAMMA SAY HE IS A GOOD MAN WAPSIE BECAUSE LITTLE MAN HE IS A GOOD MAN SAID THE VICAR RECALLED BY THE IMPIETY OF THE QUESTION
BUT LUKE KNEW HIS PECULIAR SMILE AND PRESUMED IT
BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN YOU DON'T IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND IT WHEN YOU FANCY I CAN DO ANYTHING TO SERVE ANYONE IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE CONNECTED WITH THAT DISAGREEABLE BUSINESS--OR THAT I AM PERSONALLY IN THE LEAST TO BLAME IN IT
IT CONTAINS MADAM THE SKELETON OF A CASE
THIS LITTLE PARCEL OF LETTERS WAS IN ITS EVIL WAY A HOLY THING
MARK'S WAS A BOLD FREE HAND AND IF THERE WAS NOTHING PARTICULARLY ELEGANT NEITHER WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD BE CALLED VULGAR IN IT
THAT TOO PLAINLY REFERS TO A FORMER LETTER--NOT A WORD OF THE SORT
SHE DOES NOT LIKE ME MAYBE
WILLIE DARLING DON'T YOU WISH HIM TO COME IN MOST PARTICULARLY
TO MY SURPRISE A LARGE LETTER BEARING THE GYLINGDEN POSTMARK AND WITH A SEAL AS LARGE AS A FLORIN SHOWING HAD I EXAMINED THE HERALDRY THE BRANDON ARMS WITH THE LAKE BEARINGS QUARTERED THEREON AND PROVING TO BE A VERY EARNEST INVITATION FROM STANLEY LAKE FOUND ME IN LONDON JUST ABOUT THIS TIME
LARKIN SOLICITOR AND THE VICAR AND MESSRS
AND NOW DEAR SHE SAID AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE YOU'LL REMEMBER YOUR SOLEMN PROMISE I NEVER BROKE MY WORD DEAR DORCAS
I'M NOW EMANCIPATED FOR I HOPE A WEEK OR TWO
SUFFICIENT TIME MUST BE ALLOWED TO INTERVENE TO DISCONNECT THE PURCHASE OF THE VICAR'S REMAINDER FROM THE NEWS OF MARK WYLDER'S DEMISE
HIS DOUBTS AND SUSPICIONS HAD SUBSIDED AND HE NOW BELIEVED WITH A PROFOUND MORAL CERTAINTY THAT MARK WYLDER WAS ACTUALLY DEAD WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF A MAD-HOUSE OR OF SOME LAWLESS PLACE OF DETENTION ABROAD
RACHEL BEHELD THE THINGS WHICH WERE COMING TO PASS LIKE AN AWFUL DREAM
THE LUCKIEST DOG IN ENGLAND
BUT SHE WAS MISTAKEN
HE LOOKS BETTER--A LITTLE BETTER DON'T YOU THINK
AND AS HE GLIDED THROUGH THE DARK TOWARDS SPLENDID OLD BRANDON HE GROUND HIS TEETH AND UTTERED TWO OR THREE SENTENCES WHICH NO RESPECTABLE PUBLISHER WOULD LIKE TO PRINT
BUT SHE COULD SAY NOTHING TO THE PURPOSE EITHER
THE PROCESS IS SIMPLE JOS
A CLEVER GIRL LIKE YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN FUTURE AND WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME NOW SHE ASKED WITH A FIERCE COLD STARE
HERE IS LAKE WITH A NOBLE OLD PLACE INEXHAUSTIBLE IN VARIETY
NOT A SOUL WAS STIRRING--NOT A SOUND BUT THOSE SAD AND SOOTHING OF NATURE WAS TO BE HEARD
THEY HAD HARDLY TURNED THE CORNER HOWEVER WHEN HE POPPED HIS HEAD FORWARD AND CHANGED THE DIRECTION
A MESSAGE OR BUSINESS SAID MR LARKIN URBANELY
MY ROOM WAS LARGE AND OLD-FASHIONED BUT SNUG
I ONLY MEANT YOU USED NOT TO BE A FOOL AND PRAY DON'T BEGIN NOW
PERHAPS YOU THINK I OUGHT TO GO AND HOUSEKEEP FOR YOU WHY--HA HA!--I REALLY DON'T KNOW RADIE WHERE I SHALL BE
AND SO IT WAS WITH THAT PROUD COLD CHEF D'OEUVRE OF TINTED STATUARY
YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REALLY SERIOUS ANNOYANCE--YOU DON'T KNOW THE PARTY SAID HE
AND THEN--FOR THE ATTORNEY HAD ALL THE FAMILY SETTLEMENTS PRESENT TO HIS MIND--THERE WAS THIS CLEAR MOTIVE FOR PROLONGING HIS LIFE THAT BY THE SLIP IN THE WILL UNDER WHICH DORCAS BRANDON INHERITED THE BULK OF HER ESTATE WOULD TERMINATE WITH THE LIFE OF MARK WYLDER
HE STATED THAT YOU HAD OFFERED TO ADVANCE A SUM OF 600_L FOR THE LIQUIDATION OF HIS LIABILITIES
HIS LETTER TO CHELFORD SIX WEEKS AGO WAS FROM BOULOGNE
WHAT OF HER RACHEL VERY FLUSHED AND AGITATED STILL WAS NOW TRYING TO SPEAK AS USUAL
BUDDLE IN THE HALL AFTERWARDS DECLINED BREAKFAST--HE HAD A BOARD TO ATTEND
HE HAD NOT STIRRED ALL THE TIME SHE WAS THERE
HE'S A CUNNING DOG AND NOT VERY SOFT-HEARTED
THE ICE ONCE BROKEN JOS
THE GENTLEMAN IS LIBERAL AND IF YOU CAN JUST HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU WILL HAVE LITTLE TROUBLE IN SATISFYING HIM UPON ALL OTHER POINTS
LAKE SAUNTERED BACK SLOWLY TOWARD THE HALL
WHEN I GOT THIS RING CHARLIE THREE HUNDRED A YEAR AND A LONDON LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN PERU AND PARADISE TO POOR PILL GARLICK AND SEE WHAT IT HAS DONE FOR ME AYE AND BETTER THAN ALADDIN'S FOR YOU NEED NOT RUB IT AND BRING UP THAT CONFOUNDED UGLY GENII
SHE FELT A SORT OF ALARM IN WHICH THERE WAS SOME LITTLE MIXTURE OF THE SUPERSTITIOUS AND SHE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR NOT ENTERING THE ROOM BUT STARING IN TOWARD THE WINDOW WHERE AGAINST THE DIM EXTERNAL LIGHT SHE CLEARLY SAW WITHOUT RECOGNISING IT A TALL FIGURE GREETING HER WITH MOP AND MOE
AND THE RUDDY LIGHT TINTED HIS PALE FEATURES
HE HAD PROMISED HIM THAT LOAN TOO WHICH WOULD HAVE LIFTED HIM OUT OF HIS SLOUGH OF DESPOND AND HE CLUNG WITH AN AFFECTIONATE GRATITUDE TO THESE EXHIBITIONS OF BROTHERLY LOVE
HA!--LOOK
SO IN DUE COURSE HAVING SMOKED MY CHEROOT I JERKED THE STUMP INTO THE FIRE
THEN DOLLY BETHOUGHT HER OF HER PROMISE TO RACHEL
AND ARE THERE NOT MOMENTS WHEN THEY BECOME ALMOST INSIPID
AND CHELFORD WHO IS MOST ANXIOUS TO TRACE MARK WYLDER HAVING TO SURRENDER--I THINK THEY CALL IT--A TRUST IS NOT IT--OR SOMETHING--I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS--TO HIM AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND OUT HIS ADDRESS MR LARKIN WROTE TO SIR JULIUS WHOM CHELFORD DID NOT FIND AT HOME TO ASK HIM FOR A DESCRIPTION OF MARK TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER HE HAD DISGUISED HIMSELF
STANLEY DEAR WHAT'S THE MATTER IN HEAVEN'S NAME SHE WHISPERED SO SOON AS SHE HAD GOT HIM INTO HER LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM
ANY WAY IT WAS YOUR DUTY TO HAVE PRINTED SOME NOTICE THAT THE THING WAS THOUGHT OF
ONE WORD OF HER WILD PROTEST HE DID NOT BELIEVE
STILL HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT HE COULD FORGET HIS PROMISE OR SHUT UP HIS BOWELS OF MERCY OR LONG DELAY THE REMITTANCE WHICH HE KNEW TO BE SO URGENTLY NEEDED
THE AIR WAS SO SHARP SO CLEAR SO SUNNY THE MYSTERIOUS SENSE OF COMING LIFE SO INVIGORATING AND THE SOUNDS AND ASPECT OF NATURE SO REJOICING THAT RACHEL WITH HER GAUNTLETS ON HER WHITE BASKET OF FLOWER SEEDS HER TROWEL AND ALL HER GARDEN IMPLEMENTS BESIDE HER FELT HER OWN SPRING OF LIFE RETURN AND REJOICED IN THE GLAD HOUR THAT SHONE ROUND HER
I SHALL KNOW MORE OF COURSE WHEN I'VE SEEN JAMES DUTTON
I THINK YOU'D BETTER
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF WYLDER'S HAND BY J
SO I SAT UP TO DETECT HIM AND HEARING THE DOOR OPEN AND A STEP I PURSUED AND FIND I'VE MADE A MISTAKE
IT WAS A SORT OF TRADITIONARY LOYALTY
BOTH LADIES IN AN INSTANT WERE AT THE BEDSIDE LOOKING AT THE PEAKED AND WHITE COUNTENANCE WHICH WAS ALL THEY WERE EVER AGAIN TO SEE OF STANLEY
BUT IN THE MAIN IT WAS A LOYAL TOWN AND TRUE TO ITS PRINCESS
STILL PURSUING HER SOLEMN AND MELANCHOLY DISCOURSE THE YOUNG LADY FOLLOWED THE PATH ACCOMPANIED BY THE VICAR
YOU'LL NOT BELIEVE UNTIL IT HAPPENS AND WHEN IT DOES YOU'D GIVE YOUR EYES YOU COULD UNDO IT
DEATH COMES TO OTHER WOMEN IN ITS ACCUSTOMED WAY
AND NOW MY DEAR MISS LAKE IT IS TOO LATE--_QUITE TOO LATE NO
YES DARLING THANK YOU
YES DORCAS MY BELOVED MY ONLY DARLING YOU WILL YET KNOW ALL IT HAS COST ME TO RETAIN FROM YOU EVEN THIS FOLLY
CHAPTER XXXV
SO IT WAS PROPHESIED BY THE BLACK MAGICIAN I THOUGHT SIR YOU MENTIONED JUST NOW HE WAS A CLERGYMAN SUGGESTED MR WEALDON WHO EVIDENTLY ENJOYED THIS WONDERFUL YARN
THEY SAY THAT LITTLE MANNIKIN WON'T GET WELL AND AM I ALWAYS TO BE SICK HERE IN MY LITTLE BED WAPSIE WHISPERED LITTLE FAIRY IN HIS DREAMY EARNEST WAY THAT WAS NEW TO HIM
WHAT DOES DOCTOR BUDDLE SAY HE SAW HIM YESTERDAY MORNING
HE ORDERED THE TAX-CART AND TWO HORSES TO DRIVE TANDEM
AFFAIRS I MUST ONLY FORFEIT
I REALLY CAN'T SAY NOT HAVING READ IT BUT THERE MAY SAID CAPTAIN LAKE WHO WAS NOW AND THEN A LITTLE IMPERTINENT JUST TO KEEP MR LARKIN IN HIS PLACE AND PERHAPS TO HINT THAT HE UNDERSTOOD HIM
BUT HE'S NO CREDIT TO THE FAMILY YOU SEE AND I NEVER COULD ABIDE HIM
HE HAD ABUNDANCE OF MATTER FOR THOUGHT AND PERTURBATION AND FELT HIMSELF WHEN THE IMAGES OF LARCOM LARKIN AND JIM DUTTON CROSSED THE RETINA OF HIS MEMORY SOME THRILL OF THE FEAR WHICH HATH TORMENT'--THE FEAR OF A TERRIBLE COERCION WHICH HE LIKED SO WELL TO PRACTISE IN THE CASE OF OTHERS
HE SMILED LITTLE ON OTHERS I BELIEVE BUT ALWAYS KINDLY UPON ME
SO THAT BEING UNDERSTOOD--EH?--I SUPPOSE WE HAVE NOTHING PARTICULAR TO ADD AND CAPTAIN LAKE EXTENDED HIS GLOVED HAND TO TAKE LEAVE
AND SO THERE HOVERED IN MY CURIOSITY SOME LITTLE FLICKER OF EGOTISTIC ROMANCE WHICH HELPED TO ROUSE MY SPIRITS AND SPUR ME ON TO ACTION
BUT THE HOUSE THOUGH SMALL WAS BUILT WITH THICK PARTITION WALLS AND SOUNDS WERE WELL ENCLOSED IN THE ROOMS TO WHICH THEY BELONGED
IT WAS BUT A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE WITH MITIGATIONS
WITH THIS CONVICTION CAME A SENSE OF SUPERIORITY AND A PLEASANT CONFIDENCE IN HIS POSITION WHICH BETRAYED ITSELF IN A SLIGHT FROWN AND A PALLID SMILE AS HE LOOKED STEADILY IN THE YOUNG MAN'S FACE WITH HIS SMALL CRAFTY HUNGRY EYES
OH STANLEY
THE VICAR'S COMPLICATIONS WHICH LIVELY PEOPLE HAD BETTER NOT READ
OF COURSE IT WILL BE EXPENSIVE BUT NOTHING LIKE THE OTHER
LARKIN FIGURE AS THE PURCHASER BY NAME
HER COTTON GOWN HAD ONCE HAD A PALE PATTERN OVER IT BUT WEAR AND WASHING HAD DESTROYED ITS TINTS TILL IT WAS NO BETTER THAN WHITE WITH A MOTTLING OF GRAY
HOW QUIET YOU ARE HERE SAID THE CAPTAIN
BY-THE-BYE I HAD A LETTER THIS MORNING FROM THAT PARTY--OUR COMMON FRIEND MR W YOU KNOW SAID LARKIN GRACEFULLY
I WAS BITTEN HOWEVER ALREADY BY THE INTEREST OF THE COMING CONTEST
I WAS SO CONFOUNDEDLY NERVOUS THAT EVEN A HARMLESS NECESSARY CAT APPALLED ME AND I CLAPPED MY DOOR AS IF AGAINST AN EVIL SPIRIT
THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD GREETED HER WITH PROPER RESPECT AND DORCAS MET HER GRACIOUSLY AND WITH ALL THE EXTERNALS OF KINDNESS
RACHEL WAS ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHO NO MATTER WHAT MAY BE UPON THEIR MINDS ARE QUICKLY IMPRESSIBLE BY THE SCENES IN WHICH THEY FIND THEMSELVES
I WAS QUITE HAPPY STRIDING IN THE AMBER LIGHT AND SOFT LONG SHADOWS AMONG THE FERNS THE COPSEWOOD AND THE GRAND OLD CLUMPS OF TIMBER EXPLORING THE UNDULATIONS AND THE WILD NOOKS AND HOLLOWS WHICH HAVE EACH THEIR CIRCUMSCRIBED AND SYLVAN CHARM
BUT I WAS CALLED ON TO DECIDE FOR YOU IN YOUR ABSENCE AND THEY ALL THOUGHT POOR LAKE COULD NOT BE MOVED ON TO GYLINGDEN WITHOUT DANGER YOU DID QUITE RIGHTLY CHELFORD AND I THANK YOU SAID MISS BRANDON COLDLY
YES--MUCH BETTER
NOT SO WELL I AM SURE AS YOU MIGHT HAVE MARRIED
THIS PLAIN OF GREEN TURF BROKE GRADUALLY INTO A HEATH
A SHORT DEED TO BE CONSULTED UPON ON BEHALF OF HIS CLIENT PUDDER SWYNFEN ESQ OF SWYNFEN GRANGE IN THE SAME COUNTY
ITS LIGHT WAS DARKENED
IT HAD ALREADY THE DISMAL CHARACTER OF A SICK CHAMBER
IT REACHED MR LARKIN AS HE SAT AT BREAKFAST WITH HIS FRIEND STANLEY LAKE
I HAVE WRITTEN ALREADY
DURING THE FEW DAYS AGONY OF PREPARATION THAT IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED THIS NOTABLE ORGIE THE GOOD LADY'S COUNTENANCE BESPOKE THE MAGNITUDE OF HER CARES
WE CALLED HIM THE MAGICIAN HE WAS SO LIKE THE PICTURES OF ALADDIN'S UNCLE WHY HE WAS AN AFRICAN I INTERPOSED MY SENSE OF ACCURACY OFFENDED
I'VE SOMETIMES THOUGHT MY STRUGGLES AND SINKINGS AMUSED HER CRUEL SERENITY
THOMAS BREWEN THE FOOTMAN WHO IS UNDER NOTICE TO LEAVE HAS TWICE TO THE CAPTAIN'S KNOWLEDGE PLAYED ME THE SAME TRICK AND STOLE OUT THROUGH THE GUNROOM WINDOW AT NIGHT AND DENIED IT AFTERWARDS
BUT THAT'S OVER SIR
YES HE WOULD TELL POOR DOLLY FIRST AND THEN HIS LITTLE MAN
BUT HERE WAS THE QUIET SAGACIOUS PEER WHO HAD SHOWN HIMSELF ON TWO REMARKABLE COMMITTEES SO QUICK AND ABLE A MAN OF BUSINESS AND THE PICTURE OF THE VICAR'S SITUATION AND OF THE POWERS AND TERRORS OF MESSRS
MY DARLING HE'S LIKE HIMSELF SIR WHILE HE'S SITTING UP--HIS LITTLE HEAD QUITE RIGHT AGAIN MY HEAD'S QUITE RIGHT WAPSIE THE LITTLE MAN WHISPERED SADLY
BUT DORCAS ONLY IN RICH AND STATELY BRANDON HALL--THE BEAUTIFUL GENIUS LOCI UNDER LOFTY CEILINGS CURIOUSLY MOULDED IN THE FIRST JAMES'S STYLE--AMID CARVED OAK AND RICHEST DRAPERIES TALL CHINA VASES PAINTINGS AND COLD WHITE STATUES
YOU MAKE TOO MUCH OF IT MY DEAR SIR
NOW WHILE THE IMPROVED INSTRUMENT WAS IN PREPARATION THE ATTORNEY STROLLED DOWN IN THE EVENING TO LOOK AFTER HIS CLERICAL CLIENT AND KEEP HIM STRAIGHT FOR THE MEETING AT WHICH HE WAS TO SIGN THE ARTICLES NEXT DAY
AND I NEVER SAID I GAVE HER SIXPENCE--DID I
I KNOW VERY WELL I'M A MISERABLE SINNER BUT THERE'S MERCY ABOVE AND I DON'T HIDE MY FAULTS
GOOD-BYE AND SHE EXTENDED HER HAND
ARE YOU CERTAIN
I COULD NOT STAND UPRIGHT IN THIS ROOM WITH MY HAT ON
I ONLY WANT TO EXPLAIN IT AND GET YOUR ADVICE AND ANY LITTLE ASSISTANCE YOU CAN GIVE ME
AND YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OR TRIED TO BE OF ANY EARTHLY USE TO ME
NO WONDER THEN THAT THE GOOD ATTORNEY WAS MORE THAN USUALLY BLAND AND HAPPY THAT DAY
HEY
AND THE FACT IS HE ADDED STEADILY UNLESS I HAVE THAT NOTE BEFORE I LEAVE TO-MORROW-MORNING I'LL ASSUME THAT YOU WISH TO BE OFF CAPTAIN LAKE AND I WILL ADAPT MYSELF TO CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MAY HAVE IT NOW SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH A FIERCE CARELESSNESS
IT LOOKS A LITTLE FISHY HE SAYS--WELL SO IT DOES--"WE MAY TAKE THE DIVISION TO-NIGHT
HERE'S THE KEY OF MY BED-ROOM--SAY I'M SICK--AND YOU MUST GO IN AND OUT AND BRING TEA AND DRINKS AND TALK AND WHISPER A LITTLE YOU UNDERSTAND AS YOU MIGHT WITH A SICK PERSON AND KEEP THE SHUTTERS CLOSED
NOW THERE WAS THIS CONSOLATION IN POOR LARKIN'S CASE THAT ALTHOUGH HE WAS QUITE RUN AGROUND AND A DEFAULTER IN THE DOLLINGTON BANK TO THE EXTENT OF 7_L
HE WAS RIGHT
DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING SO BEE-UTIFUL IN YOUR LIFE
AND I'M ALWAYS OF COURSE AT YOUR COMMAND PSHAW SAID LAKE ANGRILY
AND ODDLY ENOUGH ONE BLACK LOCK OF HAIR WHICH HE WORE TWISTED IN A FORMAL CURL FLAT ON HIS FOREHEAD REMAINED UNDISTURBED IN ITS POSITION AS IT WAS FIXED THERE AT HIS LAST TOILET FOR BRANDON HALL
YOU SEE THE OLD BRUTE MEANT TO LEAVE HER A LIFE ESTATE
DON'T BE AFRAID DEAR I'M NOT AFRAID--WOMAN
HE HAD HIS HAND UPON LAKE'S SHOULDER THEY ARE COUSINS YOU KNOW
OF COURSE
OF COURSE
WOULD HE LIKE HIS PRECIOUS HEAD LOWER A BIT
BUT I CAN'T HEAR A MAN OF BUSINESS LIKE YOU ASSERT UPON WHAT HE CONCEIVES TO BE RELIABLE INFORMATION--SITUATED AS THE BRANDON TITLE IS--DEPENDING I MEAN IN SOME MEASURE UPON HIS LIFE--THAT MARK WYLDER IS NO MORE WITHOUT BEING A GOOD DEAL SHOCKED I QUITE UNDERSTAND SIR--QUITE CAPTAIN LAKE
THERE WAS NOW A GRAND COUP UNDER DISCUSSION--THE FORESTALLING OF ALL THE HORSES AND VEHICLES ALONG THE LINE OF RAILWAY AND IN ALL THE PRINCIPAL POSTING ESTABLISHMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY
YOU CANNOT GO ON LIVING LIKE THIS
HE COULD NOT BE SURE OF COURSE BUT AT ALL EVENTS THE PERSISTENT STARE WAS EXTREMELY AND PERHAPS DETERMINEDLY IMPERTINENT
I REMAIN MY DEAR AND REVEREND SIR WITH PROFOUND REGRETS AND SYMPATHY YOURS VERY SINCERELY JOS
STUPID
SO LAKE OPENED THE TIMES AND AS HE STUDIED ITS COLUMNS I THINK HE STOLE A GLANCE OR TWO OVER ITS MARGIN AT THE ATTORNEY NOW DEEP IN THE LETTER OF SIR JULIUS HOCKLEY
THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM NOT TO TIRE HIMSELF TALKING AND OFFERED IF HE WISHED TO MAKE A STATEMENT BEFORE A MAGISTRATE TO ARRANGE THAT ONE SHOULD ATTEND AND RECEIVE IT
AND YET THE LIKENESS MUST HAVE BEEN OF THE RUDEST POSSIBLE SORT
AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE COURT IN COMMENTING UPON MR JOS
I WONDER WHAT HAS BECOME OF THAT OLD BOOK WITH ITS ODD LITTLE WOODCUTS
THERE ARE RENTS TO BE RECEIVED BY ME AND SUMS HANDED OVER TO A CONSIDERABLE--I MAY SAY INDEED A VERY LARGE AMOUNT
AT ALL EVENTS IT FLASHED THE SAME SUSPICION OF LAKE UPON HIS MIND AGAIN
THERE IN THE TRANSPARENT GREEN SHADOW STAND THE TWO MILLS--THE OLD ONE WITH A.D
I DON'T QUESTION YOUR GOOD OPINION MISS BRANDON OF YOUR OWN DISCRETION
NO MORE CONSOLATIONS CLAIMED--NO MORE BROKEN TOYS TO BE MENDED--SOME OF THE INNOCENT LITTLE RUBBISH LAY IN THE STUDY
HUSH WHISPERED UNCLE LORNE AND HE LIMPED SOFTLY INTO THE ROOM AND STOPPED ABOUT THREE YARDS AWAY SHE IS NOT DEAD BUT SLEEPETH HALLO
TEN DAYS IS SO SHORT A TIME AND I CAN DO NOTHING MR LARKIN STOOD AT THE WINDOW RUMINATING WITH HIS LEFT HAND IN HIS BREECHES POCKET AND HIS RIGHT WITH FINGER AND THUMB PINCHING HIS UNDER LIP AFTER HIS WONT AND THE DESPAIRING ACCENTS OF THE POOR VICAR'S LAST SENTENCE STILL IN HIS EAR
WELL IT IS YOUNG AGAIN AND BEAUTIFUL
HE'LL HURT HER--HE'LL HURT HER--HE'LL HURT HER
AND THE ATTORNEY WHO HAD A WAY LIKE HIM OF NOTING THINGS WITHOUT APPEARING TO SEE THEM WAS CONSCIOUS OF IT AND WAS PERHAPS DECIDED BY THIS TRIFLE TO ACCOST THE GALLANT CAPTAIN
MR WYLDER REFUSES TO EXECUTE THE DEED OF SALE CERTAINLY SAID LORD CHELFORD TAKING THIS REPLY UPON HIMSELF
IRONY IS THE WEAPON OF COWARDICE AND COWARDICE THE VICE OF WEAKNESS
IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE IT EITHER DULL OR BASE
AND SO UNDERSTANDING IT WITH THAT ONE AWFUL LOOK THAT MAY BE THE LAST SHE GLIDED FROM THE BED-SIDE TOLD OLD DOROTHY THAT HE SEEMED DISPOSED TO SLEEP AND LEFT THE ROOM
I CAN ONLY WISH
OH NO--RUN UP TO TOWN
AND IN THE EVENT OF THEIR HAZARDING SUCH A MEASURE THE REV
NOW DORKIE I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL
LARKIN EXAMINED THESE MYSTERIOUS EPISTLES ONCE MORE
AND BY JOVE SIR
IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT HAVING GOT ONE MOMENTOUS MATTER WELL OFF HIS MIND THE GOOD ATTORNEY WAS TO BE LONG RID OF ANXIETIES
REGIMENT OF GUARDS IDLER SCAMP COXCOMB AND THE BEAUTIFUL DORCAS BRANDON HEIRESS OF BRANDON WERE MAN AND WIFE
HE WALKED AT HIS BEST PACE HOWEVER AND INDEED WAS CONFOUNDEDLY UNEASY ABOUT HIS OWN PERSONAL LIABILITIES
BUT WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
AND HIS HAIR IS ALWAYS STANDING STRAIGHT ON HIS HEAD FOR FEAR
MY SHIPS COME HOME A MONTH BEFORE THE DAY
AND THE OLD WOMAN'S FACE AFFORDED STANLEY LAKE NO CLUE TO THE COMING THEME
AND DORCAS CLOSED THOSE STRANGE WILD EYES THAT HAD SO FATALLY FASCINATED HER AND THEN SHE TREMBLED WITHOUT SPEAKING OR SHEDDING A TEAR
HE HAS DONE IT
BUT DON'T MAKE A ROW
FAREWELL MRS WYLDER AND WITH A SILENT BOW TO RACHEL--PERFECTLY POLISHED PERFECTLY TERRIBLE--HE WITHDREW FOLLOWED BY THE SALLOW CLERK AND BY THAT RADIANT SCAMP OLD BUGGS WHO MADE THEM SEVERAL OBEISANCES AT THE DOOR
HE THOUGHT HE NOW BEGAN TO DISCERN THE OUTLINES OF A GIGANTIC AND SYMMETRICAL VILLAINY EMERGING THROUGH THE FOG
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND TO SPEAK TO HIM
HE WOULD GET MURRAY'S HANDBOOKS AND ALL SORTS OF WORKS--HE WAS DETERMINED TO READ IT UP
I SEE YOU HAVE USED ME
OH YES CERTAINLY AND NOW THAT LITTLE STAR OF YELLOW WILL MAKE IT PERFECT SAID DORCAS
TALL JOS
YES THAT CERTAINLY DOES LOOK VERY ODDLY AND I THINK CAPTAIN LAKE IT BEHOVES US TO LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED TO SIFT THIS MATTER TO THE BOTTOM WITH WHAT PARTICULAR PURPOSE I DON'T QUITE SEE SAID LAKE
THE SIGHT OF THAT PALE FACE WAS A COLD PANG AT HER HEART--A FACE PROPHETIC OF EVIL AT SIGHT OF WHICH THE DARK CURTAIN WHICH HID FUTURITY SEEMED TO SWAY AND TREMBLE AS IF A HAND FROM BEHIND WAS ON THE POINT OF DRAWING IT
HE HAD FELT THE LIVID CHANGE OF COLOUR AND THAT TWITCHING AT HIS MOUTH AND CHEEK WHICH HE COULD NOT CONTROL
HE USED TO TALK TO ME
AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW A SENSIBLE MAN LIKE YOU KNOWING MARK WYLDER AND KNOWING ME SIR COULD USE SUCH--SUCH AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE
FAMILIAR OBJECTS GLIDED PAST HER THE SAME YET THE FASHION OF THE COUNTENANCE WAS ALTERED
BUT THAT EVENING WAS STREAKED WITH A TINGE OF HORROR AND I MORE SILENT AND DISTRAIT THAN USUAL
SO FORTH WE SALLIED AND UNDER THE AUTUMNAL FOLIAGE IN THE COOL AMBER LIGHT OF THE DECLINING EVENING WE ENJOYED OUR CHEROOTS
NOISELESSLY THEY RE-ENTERED THE LITTLE HALL OF REDMAN'S FARM
LAKE HAD NO VERY HIGH OPINION OF MEN OR WOMEN GENTLE OR SIMPLE
THIS KIND OF THING WILL DO YOU GOOD
AND WHEN ONCE SHE HAD TAKEN A CLEAR VIEW OF HER DUTY WONDERFULLY PERSISTENT AND IMPRACTICABLE
YOU KNOW RACHEL THE WORLD MUST NOT SEE THIS--WE WILL CARRY OUR HEADS HIGH
BUT HE LOOKED SERENE AND LEANED BACK WITH THE CORNER OF RACHEL'S NOTE BETWEEN TWO FINGERS
I SAW MARK FOLLOWING YOU LIKE AN APE ON ALL-FOURS
AND HAVING GOT IT WELL LIGHTED HE LEANED BACK AND BROKE THE SEAL AND READ THIS LETTER WHICH I SUSPECT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS HE FANCIED MIGHT CONTAIN MATTER OF MORE PRACTICAL IMPORT I WRITE TO YOU MY BELOVED AND ONLY BROTHER STANLEY IN AN ALTERED STATE OF MIND AND WITH CLEARER VIEWS OF DUTY THAN I THINK I HAVE EVER HAD BEFORE JUST AS I CONJECTURED MUTTERED STANLEY WITH A BITTER SMILE AS HE SHOOK THE ASHES OFF THE TOP OF HIS CIGAR--'A WOMAN'S HOMILY HE READ ON AND A LIVID FROWN GRADUALLY CONTRACTED HIS FOREHEAD AS HE DID SO
MAJOR JACKSON WHISPERED AN ABRUPT WORD OR TWO IN HIS EAR AND THREW BACK HIS HEAD EYEING LAKE WITH GRAVE AND SLY DEFIANCE
MISS LAKE HAS SPOKEN IN CHARITY I WILL HOPE AND TRUST WITHOUT THOUGHT
BUT IF ON PUBLIC GROUNDS IT IS DESIRABLE I WILL MAKE IT OF COURSE
D HIM HE HAS DONE IT GASPED STANLEY LAKE
HOW RACHEL SLEPT THAT NIGHT IN REDMAN'S FARM
IT DID BRING ME UP
BUT EVEN THE TOMB SECURES NO SECRECY
BUT HIS LAST WAS FROM BRIGHTON
AND THE DELAY--BUT RACHEL DARLING ARE YOU ILL SHE RANG THE BELL AND OPENED THE WINDOW AND GOT SOME WATER
CERTAINLY WITHIN A WEEK HE WRITES
RETIRING
AND THE POOR VICAR WAS A LITTLE PUZZLED AND BEGAN TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE HAD SAID ANYTHING GAUCHE OR OFFENSIVE--'IT WOULD BE SO VERY PAINFUL TO APPEAR UNGRATEFUL THE ATTORNEY HAD THE STATEMENT OF TITLE IN ONE HAND AND LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR READ IT DEMURELY IN SILENCE WITH THE OTHER TAPPING THE SEAL-END OF HIS GOLD PENCIL-CASE BETWEEN HIS LIPS
AND I PROMISED DOLLY TO GO DOWN TO HER TO-NIGHT IF THAT DARLING LITTLE BOY SHOULD BE WORSE--I AM VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT HIM AND IS HE IN DANGER THE HANDSOME LITTLE FELLOW SAID DORCAS
LARKIN
LARKIN
LARKIN
LARKIN
LARKIN
LARKIN
LARKIN
LARKIN
WHY HAD HE NOT SPOKEN TO HIM
FOR ONE REASON OR OTHER HE WAS AT LEAST AS STRONGLY INTERESTED AS LAKE IN MAINTAINING SECRECY
IS HE VERY MUCH HURT HE APPEARS MY LORD TO ME I REGRET TO SAY ALMOST A-DYING LIKE VERY WEAK
AND NOW AND THEN WHEN EVIL REMEMBRANCES MAYBE GATHERED ROUND HER SOLITUDE SHE WARNED THEM OFF WITH THAT BOOK OF POWER--SO THAT MY RECOLLECTION OF HER IS ALWAYS THE SAME WHITE-CLAD CADAVEROUS OLD WOMAN WITH A PAIR OF BARNACLES ON HER NOSE AND HER LOOK OF SECRECY AND SUFFERING TURNED ON THE LARGE PRINT OF THAT WORN VOLUME OR ELSE ON THE FUMBLING-POINTS OF HER KNITTING-NEEDLES
IF POOR LAKE GOES OFF ANYWHERE BETWEEN ELEVEN AND FOUR O'CLOCK I'M NABBED BY GEORGE THE DOOR WAS OPENED
WELL WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN BY REFUSING TO HELP ME EVEN WITH A HINT
YOU KNOW STANLEY WHATEVER THERE IS IS UNDER SETTLEMENT AND WE CANNOT APPLY IT DORKIE
AND THAT STUPID SCHEMING LUBBER LARKIN DRIVING HIM ABOUT IN HIS TAX-CART INSTEAD OF MINDING HIS BUSINESS
FOR WE WAXED TURKISH AND TACITURN OVER OUR TOBACCO
HE BEGAN I THINK TO FANCY SOME ESTRANGEMENT THERE
ONLY FOR A MOMENT THANK YOU
HE CLEARED IT AND SIPPED A LITTLE CLARET
I THOUGHT OF THE FAIR BRUNNISENDE WITH THE CAPTIVE KNIGHT IN THE HANDS OF HER SENESCHAL BEFORE HER AND I FANCIED HE SAID SOMETHING OF HAVING FOUND HIM TRESPASSING IN HER TOWN AND BROUGHT HIM UP FOR JUDGMENT
AND WHY NOT ANY OF THESE DORCAS SMILED COLDLY AND CONTINUED WELL I SHALL HEAR THE CARRIAGE COMING TO THE DOOR AND I'LL RETURN AND BID YOU GOOD-NIGHT
YOU ARE WELL CONNECTED--POWERFUL RELATIVES--YOUR BROTHER HAS HUXTON FOUR HUNDRED A YEAR WHENEVER OLD--THE--THE PRESENT INCUMBENT GOES--AND THERE ARE OTHER THINGS BESIDE--BUT YOU MUST NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE RUINED THROUGH TIMIDITY
I LOOKED OVER THE DOOR
LORD CHELFORD WAS A LIVELY AND AGREEABLE COMPANION
THE PEOPLE NEVER THINK OF SHUTTING THEIR DOORS HERE IN SUMMER TIME TILL THEY ARE GOING TO BED AND THEN ONLY FOR FORM'S SAKE
I WON'T STAY
IT WAS A REGULAR PLANNED THING FOR THE QUEEN'S BRACTON PEOPLE HAD BEEN DROPPING IN AN HOUR BEFORE
THERE WAS A SMALL DOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
AT THE SAME TIME HE GRACEFULLY POKED THE LITTLE NOTE BETWEEN TWO FINGERS TO CAPTAIN LAKE WHO GLANCED FULL ON HIM FOR A SECOND AS HE TOOK IT
THEN CAPTAIN LAKE UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLE AND SPEAKING QUITE ABOVE-BOARD YOU MUST DISMISS AT ONCE FROM YOUR MIND THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN DO SO UPON THE TERMS YOU HAVE OF LATE SEEN FIT TO IMPOSE
IN THE MORNING MARK WYLDER WAS EARLY UPON THE GROUND
AND WHEN THEY POURED IT INTO AND OVER HIS LIPS HE SIGHED AND CLOSED HIS EYES
HE COULD HAVE SMASHED ALL THE GLASS UPON THE TABLE
LORD CHELFORD HAD JOINED THE TWO LADIES AND HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT GERMAN ART AND SOME PLEASANT LIGHTS TO THROW FROM FOREIGN TRAVEL AND DEVIOUS READING AND WAS AS USUAL INTELLIGENT AND AGREEABLE
THE ATTORNEY'S SMALL EYE GLANCED OVER THE GROUND AND HEARTHSTONE WHERE THE BITS WERE STREWN LIKE LADIES SMOCKS ALL SILVER WHITE THAT PAINT THE MEADOWS WITH DELIGHT
HIS SPIRIT REVIVED
BUT ALL THIS TIME THE LADIES ARE CONVERSING IN DORCAS'S BOUDOIR
IT WAS MADNESS--IT IS MADNESS FOR I LOVE HIM STILL
BUT NO--THERE WAS NO NEED TO TAP AT THE WOODEN WINDOW-PANE
YOUR ENEMY IS THAT DREADFUL MR LARKIN
SO OLD YOUR--MRS DUTTON TELLS ME BUT THAT WON'T SIGNIFY
AND THIS COMBAT WITH THE DOUBTS AND TERRORS OF A MIND OF MUCH MORE THAN ORDINARY VIGOUR AND RESOURCE THOUGH ALTOGETHER FEMININE COMPELLED HIM TO BESTIR HIMSELF AND SO FOR THE TIME FOUND HIM ENTIRE OCCUPATION
IT REMAINS IN MY MEMORY AS IF THE SUN WERE ALWAYS SHINING SPECIALLY ON THIS LITTLE GARDEN MISS LAKE LAUGHED
YOU DON'T DRINK DUTTON COLOURED A LITTLE AND COUGHED AND SAID NO SIR YOU HAVE YOUR PAPERS YES SIR WE MUST BE SATISFIED AS TO YOUR SOBRIETY DUTTON
AND DOLLY IT WILL BE INEXCUSABLE WICKEDNESS IN YOU IF YOU ALLOW IT NOW WILLIE DEAR DO YOU HEAR THAT--DO YOU HEAR WHAT SHE SAYS BUT DOLLY DARLING--DEAR MISS LAKE THERE IS NO REASON WHATEVER TO SUPPOSE THAT POOR MARK IS DEAD SAID THE VICAR VERY PALE
EXPECTS THE PERIOD OF PROSTRATION AND THE RETURN OF APPETITE
BESIDES HE HAD ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF--THE ORGAN OF VENERATION STANDING PROMINENT ON THE TOP OF THE VICAR'S HEAD--TO REGARD MARK IN THE LIGHT OF A GREAT PRACTICAL GENIUS--'NATUS REBUS AGENDIS HE KNEW MEN SO THOROUGHLY--HE UNDERSTOOD THE WORLD SO MARVELLOUSLY
CHAPTER LXXIII
WELL YOU KNOW THAT WAS LETTING POOR OLD MARK OFF IN A COACH
EXCEPT TO THE YOUNG PARTY HERSELF AND IN THIS PRESENCE I HAVE NEVER MENTIONED IT
I HAVE THEREFORE MY DEAR MR WYLDER CASTING ASIDE ALL UNPLEASANT FEELING CALLED TO ENTREAT YOU TO END AND DETERMINE ANY HESITATION YOU MAY HAVE FELT AND TO EXECUTE WITHOUT ONE MOMENT'S DELAY THE ARTICLES WHICH ARE PREPARED AND WHICH MUST BE IN THE POST-OFFICE WITHIN HALF AN HOUR THEN MR JOS
FAIRY
FAIRY
THE PRECIPITOUS BANKS SHUT OUT THE SUNLIGHT EXCEPT AT NOON AND THE ROAD THROUGH THIS DEFILE OVERHUNG BY TOWERING TREES AND ROCKS WAS EVEN NOW IN SOLEMN SHADOW
FOR NEXT MORNING AT A LITTLE PAST FOUR O'CLOCK HE DIED
WAS SHE AN HELPMEET FOR A BLACK-LETTER MAN WHO TALKED WITH THE FATHERS IN HIS DAILY WALKS COULD EXTEMPORISE LATIN HEXAMETERS AND DREAM IN GREEK
I--I DON'T KNOW--MAYBE--GIVE HER SOME WATER SAID LAKE
I PROTEST I FORGOT MY GLOVES
MY POOR FATHER
DID YOU EVER SEE SO PUSHING A BRUTE SO WYLDER CHUCKED AWAY HIS CIGAR AND STOOD FOR A MINUTE WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LOOKING UP AT THE STARS AS IF READING FORTUNES THERE
WHERE WILL YOU KEEP THAT NOTE
AND HE SAID I DON'T KNOW SIR THAT THE REVEREND MR WYLDER WOULD ENTERTAIN ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF A SALE OF HIS REVERSION
WHAT A
IT ANSWERS WITH THE WORLD
I MERELY HEARD THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME TRIFLING ALTERCATION IN THE SUPPER-ROOM
TO ME FROM ASSOCIATION NO DOUBT THAT PARK HAS ALWAYS HAD A MELANCHOLY CHARACTER
IT IS MARK WYLDER'S WRITING--I'LL SWEAR TO IT
LARKIN HE HAD ALREADY IMPORTED THE H
AND THIS PALPABLY REFERS TO SOME DIRECTION
THERE IS A STAINED WINDOW IN THE EAST WHICH CONNOISSEURS IN THAT BRANCH OF MEDIAEVAL ART ADMIRE
WE MUST TAKE THINGS COOLLY AND CAUTIOUSLY
FOR THEM IT IS NOT EASY TO SEE WHERE WISDOM ENDS AND GUILE BEGINS--WHAT WILES ARE JUSTIFIED TO HONOUR AND WHAT PARTAKE OF THE GENIUS OF THE ROBBER AND WHERE LIE THE DELICATE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN LEGITIMATE DIPLOMACY AND DAMNABLE LYING
A MISERABLE SINNER HAVE I BEEN MY FRIEND BUT DETAILS PROFIT NEITHER THEE NOR ME
JERMYN AND CARTER WERE CHARGING MARK WYLDER IN SO MANY WORDS WITH NOT PLAYING FAIRLY--THERE WAS AN ACE OF HEARTS ON THE TABLE PLAYED BY HIM AND BEFORE THREE MINUTES THEY BROUGHT IT HOME--AND IN FACT IT WAS QUITE CLEAR THAT POOR DEAR MARK HAD HELPED HIMSELF TO IT IN QUITE AN IRREGULAR WAY OH DEAR CAPTAIN LAKE OH DEAR HOW SHOCKING--HOW INEXPRESSIBLY SHOCKING
THE GYLINGDEN YOUNG LADIES USED TO PEEP IN AND FROM THE LOBBY OBSERVE THE WENCHES DRY-RUBBING AND WAXING THE FLOOR AND THE GREAT MR PUMMICE WITH HIS MYRMIDONS IN APRONS AND PAPER CAPS RETOUCHING THE GILDING
MR MARK WYLDER PERHAPS YOU REFER TO YES
A SENTIMENT HOWEVER NOT ALTOGETHER UNSERVICEABLE
WILL YOU AGREE TO THIS DOLLY DEAR
THEN SHE COMMENCED HER DARK WALK UP THE MILL-ROAD--HER HANDS STILL CLASPED HER LIPS MOVING IN BROKEN APPEALS TO HEAVEN
YES SIR
IS HE SAID LAKE WITH A SLY SCOFF THOUGH HE SEEMED TO ME A GOOD DEAL SCARED
HONEST LARCOM WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY SORT OF COVER TO HIDE HIS ADVANCE
AND HE TALKED OF HIS ELECTIONEERING AS ONLY SUSPENDED FOR A DAY OR TWO
I HAVE BEEN AWFULLY DISSIPATED SINCE I SAW YOU IN AN INNOCENT WAY MY DEAR CAPTAIN LAKE YOU MEAN OF COURSE--IN AN INNOCENT WAY OH
AND BE HIS SKILL MUCH OR LITTLE TRUSTS IN HIM AND WILL EVEN JOKE A LITTLE ASTHMATIC JOKE AND SMILE A FEEBLE HECTIC SMILE ABOUT HIS AILMENTS WHEN HE IS PRESENT
I SUSPECT IT IS RATHER THAT SOMETHING OF THE OLD PICTURE IS OBLITERATED IN THAT LITTLE INTERVAL TO RETURN NO MORE
IN THE MEANTIME CAPTAIN LAKE ACCEPTED THE TRUST
LAKE COLLECTED HIMSELF
HE HOPED THE ATTORNEY MIGHT NOT SUCCEED IN DISCOVERING JIM DUTTON'S WHEREABOUTS
THEY CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY EVER SPEAKS QUITE THE TRUTH
SO HE STOPPED AND LIFTED HIS HAT AND GREETED HER
AND MAY I PARTICULARLY ASK THAT YOU WILL SO ATTEND TO WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY AS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A NOTE OF IT FOR MR WELDER'S CONSIDERATION CERTAINLY IF YOU DESIRE
I WISH YOU'D LET ME ADOPT YOU FOR AN UNCLE
LARKIN'S PRIDE LIKE ALL HIS OTHER PASSIONS--EXCEPT HIS WEAKNESS FOR THE PRECIOUS METALS--WAS UNDER PROPER REGULATION
EVERYTHING PROMISED FAIRLY--THE QUIET MIND WAS RETURNING--THE GOOD TIME COMING--ALL THE PLEASANTER FOR THE STORMS AND SNOWS OF THE NIGHT THAT WAS OVER
WELL HE SAID HESITATINGLY IT IS NOT EASY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE TO POINT OUT A SUITABLE SOLICITOR
HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AGAIN AND HELD IT TO HIS EAR AND CONSULTED IT ONCE MORE BEFORE HE PLACED THE TINY GOLD DISK AGAIN IN HIS POCKET
HE'S SELFISH
IT IS A LITTLE COLD HERE
LITTLE FAIRY WAS ASKING HIM A QUESTION ALL THIS TIME VERY VEHEMENTLY HOW LONG WAS JACK'S SWORD THAT HE KILLED THE GIANTS WITH AND SEVERAL TIMES TO THIS DISTINCT QUESTION HE RECEIVED ONLY THE UNSATISFACTORY REPLY YES MY DARLING AND AT LAST WHEN LITTLE FAIRY MOUNTED HIS KNEE AND HUGGING THE ABSTRACTED VICAR ROUND THE NECK URGED HIS QUESTION WITH KISSES AND LAMENTATIONS THE PARSON ANSWERED WITH A LOOK OF GREAT PERPLEXITY AND ONLY HALF RECALLED SAID INDEED LITTLE MAN I DON'T KNOW
BUT LIGHT IS STILL MORE DREADFUL NOW AND I THINK I'LL CHANGE
I SHOUTED LUSTILY AFTER HIM TO STAY AND THEN IN A SORT OF HALF-FRIGHTENED RAGE I PURSUED HIM
HOW WONDERFUL AND MYSTERIOUS IS THE INFLUENCE OF LIGHT
ANOTHER THOUGHT NOW STRUCK HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME
I AM SO SORRY WELL HE HAS LIKE OTHER FELLOWS ONLY HE CAN'T GET AWAY AS EASILY AND HE HAS BEEN VERY MUCH PRESSED SINCE MARK WENT FOR HE HAS NOT YET LENT HIM A GUINEA AND IN FACT RACHEL SAYS SHE THINKS HE IS IN DANGER OF BEING REGULARLY SOLD OUT
WHAT A FOOL YOU WERE NEAR BECOMING SHE LOOKED LIKE HER OLD PLEASANT SELF DURING THIS LITTLE SPEECH--ARCH AND FRESH AND STILL SMILING--SHE LOOKED UP AND SIGHED AND THEN HER DARK LOOK RETURNED AND SHE SAID DISMALLY WHAT UTTER MADNESS AND LEANED FOR A WHILE WITH HER FINGERS UPON THE WINDOW SASH
SO HE GOT IN ONE OF THE CLERKS WHO WERE DIRECTING THE CANVASSING CIRCULARS AND GAVE HIM THE DRAFT APPROVED BY HIS COUNSEL TO READ ALOUD WHILE HE FOLLOWED WITH HIS EYE UPON THE ENGROSSED DEED
I WAS NOT THINKING OF THAT
AND HAT IN HAND WITH HIS CANE IN HIS FINGERS HE MADE ANOTHER GLANCE AND A NOD OVER HIS SHOULDER AT THE THRESHOLD AND THEN GLIDED FORTH INTO THE LITTLE GARDEN AND SO TO THE MILL-ROAD DOWN WHICH AT A SWIFT PACE HE WALKED TOWARDS THE VILLAGE
I SOMETIMES YEARN FOR IT AS THEY SAY FOREIGN GIRLS DO FOR CONVENT LIFE POOR DORCAS SAID RACHEL VERY SOFTLY FIXING HER EYES UPON HER WITH A LOOK OF INEXPRESSIBLE SADNESS AND PITY
WHY SAID HE HOLDING THE TEXT BEFORE HIS EYES IN ONE HAND AND WITH THE FINGERS OF THE OTHER TOUCHING THE TOP OF HIS BALD FOREHEAD TOM WEALDON IS NOT ONCE MENTIONED IN THIS NOR IN ANY OF THEM
I REALLY BEG YOUR PARDON RADIE BUT IT IS PRECIOUS STUFF
VERY QUIET--YES OF COURSE VERY QUIET AND QUITE HARMLESS TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE IN THE HOUSE WITH HIM AND SEE HIM BUT ONCE IN HALF-A-DOZEN YEARS
ALAS
BUT I SEE YOU ARE NOT JUST NOW IN A MOOD TO TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT MY NONSENSE--WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT TO-MORROW
I'LL LET BRANDON AND ABDICATE
AT THE DOOR OF HER BOUDOIR RACHEL LAKE MET DORCAS
THERE--I SAY--A PASSENGER FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AT THE SAME MOMENT A WINDOW OF THE CAB--SHALL WE CALL IT--WAS LET DOWN AND A FEMALE VOICE--RACHEL LAKE'S--CALLED TO THE DRIVER TO STOP
BUT THAT OF THE DYNASTY OF BRANDON HALL WAS A TRUCULENT ROMANCE
I'M SACRIFICED IT IS TRUE BUT I WON'T RENEW MY HOURLY HORRORS AND LIVE UNDER THE RULE OF YOUR DIABOLICAL SELFISHNESS SAY WHAT YOU WILL BUT KEEP YOUR TEMPER--WILL YOU HE ANSWERED MORE LIKE HIS ANGRY SELF
WELL IT IS GONE AND THIS MARRIAGE IS INDISPENSABLE
DON'T THEY SAID MARK WITH A SLY GLANCE OF COMPLACENCY AND HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD EVER HAVE GOT THEIR TITLE BY ANY OTHER MEANS
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO ANYTHING--UPON MY HONOUR I DON'T--ONLY JUST TO EXERCISE YOUR COMMON SENSE--AND YOU HAVE LOTS OF SENSE RADIE
I MUST GO BACK TO HIM
A HEARTACHE TAMAR LET ME HELP YOU OFF WITH THESE THINGS MISS RADIE DEAR THE YOUNG LADY DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR BUT SHE ALLOWED TAMAR TO REMOVE HER CLOAK AND HAT AND HANDKERCHIEF
I WISH SO MUCH MY DEAR SIR I COULD BE OF USE TO YOU
IT WAS GOOD REASON HE SHOULD PRESENT TO GOD THAT FACE WHICH HE HAD MADE
LARKIN ESQ WAS AS PUNCTUAL AS THE CLOCK AT THE TERMINUS
WYLDER WAS PLAINLY UNDER NO PHYSICAL COERCION
THE WEATHER THE SCENE THE STOMACH HOW PLEASANTLY THEY DEAL WITH FACTS--HOW THEY SUPERSEDE PHILOSOPHY AND EVEN ARITHMETIC AND TEACH US HOW MUCH OF LIFE IS INTOXICATION AND ILLUSION
HAVE I BEEN CONSULTED?--I PUT IT TO YOU
PERHAPS HE HAS BEEN INVEIGLED INTO THE HANDS OF RUFFIANS AND IS LIVING AS IT WERE UNDER THE VAULT OF AN INQUISITION AND COMPELLED TO WRITE WHAT EVER HIS GAOLERS DICTATE
A GLEAM OF GOOD HUMOUR SEEMED TO COME WITH IT AND HE SAID I WAS JUST THINKING DORKIE THAT FOR YOU AND ME ALONE THESE GREAT ROOMS ARE A LITTLE DREARY
AND I SUPPOSE HE SAID WE ARE TO REGARD THIS LITTLE CONVERSATION FOR THE PRESENT AS CONFIDENTIAL CERTAINLY CAPTAIN LAKE AND PERMIT ME TO SAY THAT I FULLY APPRECIATE THE JUST AND LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION WHICH YOU HAVE PLACED UPON MY CONDUCT--A CONSTRUCTION WHICH A PARTY LESS CANDID AND HONOURABLY-MINDED THAN YOURSELF MIGHT HAVE FAILED TO FAVOUR ME WITH AND WITH THIS PRETTY SPEECH LARKIN TOOK HIS HAT AND GRACEFULLY WITHDREW
BUT CLUMSY FELLOWS OUGHT NOT TO TRY THAT SORT OF THING
AND ACTUALLY WENT SO FAR AS TO GIVE PRICE ONE OF THOSE CHEAP AND NASTY WEEDS OF WHICH HE KEPT A SUPPLY APART IN HIS CASE FOR SUCH OCCASIONS OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP
I SAY OLD FELLOW COME OUT AND HAVE A WEED WILL YOU I RAISED MY EYES
THIS IS ALL I WILL PROBABLY TROUBLE YOU ABOUT ELECTIONS FOR SOME MONTHS TO COME OR AT LEAST WEEKS
AND SHE SENDS IT TOSSING ABOUT FROM HAND TO HAND AMONG THE SERVANTS
MR LARKIN HAD A WORD TO SAY TO THE PORTER FROM THE WINDOW AND BOUGHT ONE MORE NEWSPAPER
I ASSURE YOU DARLING I AM SERIOUS
HE HAD ALREADY PASSED THE MIDWAY POINT WHERE THIS DARK PATH BEGINS TO DESCEND THROUGH THE RAVINE INTO REDMAN'S DELL
MUCH HURT OLD BOY
YOU MUST RUN DOWN TO THE TOWN THOUGH AND BUY SOME JELLY AND YOU ARE TO BRING HER BACK CHANGE OF THIS AND HE PLACED HALF-A-CROWN IN HER HAND
HOWARD LARKIN THEN HOWARD LARKIN SIMPLY
I WALKED DOWN ONE OF THE LONG ALLEYS WITH TALL CLOSE HEDGES OF BEECH AS IMPENETRABLE AS CLOISTER WALLS TO SIGHT AND WATCHED THE TENCH BASKING AND FLICKERING IN THE CLEAR POND AND THE DAZZLING SWANS SAILING MAJESTICALLY ALONG
A LAMP SHONE FULL ON HIM
HIS LIPS STIRRED AND HIS THROAT BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK UNTIL A SECOND EFFORT BROUGHT UTTERANCE AND HE MURMURED IS THAT YOU RADIE YES DEAR
AND SAID HE WITH AN OATH AND HIS HAND TO HIS FOREHEAD OVER HIS EYEBROW IT IS THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE THING IN NATURE THEN AFTER A REVERIE OF SOME SECONDS THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN APPLIED HIMSELF ENERGETICALLY TO HIS TOILET
I REALLY BELIEVE YOU THINK NO ONE CAN ENJOY A RAMBLE LIKE THIS BUT YOURSELF COME STANLEY WHAT DO YOU WANT SAID HIS SISTER STOPPING SHORT AND SPEAKING WITH THE FLUSH OF IRRITATION ON HER CHEEK--'DO YOU MEAN TO WALK TO REDMAN'S DELL OR HAVE YOU ANYTHING UNPLEASANT TO SAY NEITHER I HOPE SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH HIS SLEEPY SMILE HIS YELLOW EYES RESTING ON THE INNOCENT GRASS BLADES BEFORE HIM
I WAS TELLING MISS BRANDON THAT WE BOTH KNOW STANLEY LAKE ON HEARING WHICH WYLDER SEEMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING UNCOMMONLY INTERESTING OR CLEVER IN THE ILLUSTRATION BEFORE HIM
AND MY DEAR ON FRIDAY WEEK HE FELL THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE FANCY EMPORIUM AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
SHE WENT IN AND SHUT THE DOOR AND CALLED TAMAR
OH WHERE WAS HE TO TURN
AND NOTHING RALLIED HER SO SURELY AS THE SENSE THAT AN ATTEMPT WAS BEING MADE TO INTIMIDATE HER
MIND I DON'T SAY ANYTHING AFFECTING THEIR INTEGRITY--HEAVEN FORBID
M
M
WILLIAM WYLDER AND MRS WYLDER AND I SAID WILLIAM IS AN OLD COLLEGE FRIEND OF MINE AND I OBSERVED HIM AS HE ENTERED WITH AN AFFECTIONATE AND SAD SORT OF INTEREST
HE'LL COME HERE SOME NIGHT AND SEE YOU SAID UNCLE LORNE LOOKING WITH A CADAVEROUS APATHY ON LAKE WHO WAS GAZING AT HIM IN RETURN WITH A SINISTER SMILE
A PROMISCUOUS MOB OF THE PLEBS AND PROFANUM VULGUS OF GYLINGDEN BESET THE DOOR TO SEE THE LADIES--THE SLIM AND THE YOUNG IN WHITE MUSLINS AND ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS AND THEIR STOUT GUARDIAN ANGELS OF MATURER YEARS IN SATINS AND VELVETS AND JEWELS--SOME REAL AND SOME JUST AS GOOD OF PASTE
IT WAS OLD LADY CHELFORD'S PLAN
WHAT WAS THAT TO THE PURPOSE
WITH A GASP SHE BEGAN TO RECOVER HERSELF
THE AGREEMENT WAS TO HAVE GONE UP TO LONDON BY THIS DAY'S MAIL AND NOW COULD NOT REACH TILL THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW--FOUR-AND-TWENTY HOURS LATER THAN WAS PROMISED
D IT BRACTON
MYSTERY IS THE SHADOW OF GUILT
I THINK THREE POUNDS A WEEK OUGHT TO DO IT VERY HANDSOME
YES I THINK SO
YOU ARE NOT AWARE MISS LAKE OF THE NATURE OF YOUR ACT AND OF THE CONSEQUENCES TO WHICH YOU HAVE EXPOSED YOURSELF MADAM
I AM GOING I THINK TO LAY IT IN THE DUST
YOU MUST BE VERY SOLITARY HERE AT TIMES--THAT IS YOU MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL MORE RESOURCE THAN I OR INDEED ALMOST ANYONE I KNOW OR THIS SOLITUDE MUST AT TIMES BE OPPRESSIVE
I THOUGHT OF THE FEW ODD WORDS AND LOOKS THAT HAD DROPPED FROM WYLDER ABOUT HIM WITH AN OMINOUS PANG AS I LOOKED AND I FELT SOMEHOW AS IF THERE WERE SOME OCCULT RELATION BETWEEN THAT CONFUSED PRELUDE OF WYLDER'S AND THE MEPHISTOPHELEAN IMAGE THAT HAD RISEN UP ALMOST UPON THE SPOT WHERE IT WAS SPOKEN
OF COURSE SHE HAS NOT
AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT WITHOUT PREPARATION OR APPARENT COURTSHIP THAT HER BROTHER HAD ACTUALLY WON THIS GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL HEIRESS AND THAT JUST EMERGED FROM THE SHADES OF DEATH HE A HALF-RUINED SCAPEGRACE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE HIS PLACE AMONG THE MAGNATES OF THE COUNTY AND NO DOUBT TO ENTER HIMSELF FOR THE BOLD AND SPLENDID GAME OF AMBITION THE STAKES OF WHICH WERE NOW IN HIS HAND TOWERED BEFORE HER LIKE AN INCREDIBLE AND DISASTROUS ILLUSION OF MAGIC
OH RECEIVING HIM WITH A PROUD SAD LOOK
ABOUT THREE WEEKS AFTER THIS GREAT COUNTY MARRIAGE THERE ARRIVED THIS TIME FROM FRANKFORT A SHARP LETTER ADDRESSED TO JOS
AND THE MORAL ALTITUDES OF THE ATTORNEY AMUSED HIM VASTLY
AND SHOULD THEY CALL YOU MUST SAY THE SAME
THESE PARLIAMENTARY WRANGLES COMMERCIAL SPECULATIONS AND FOREIGN DISPUTES ARE THEY NOT AFTER ALL BUT MELANCHOLY AND DREARY RECORDS OF THE MEREST WORLDLINESS
MISS LAKE MA'AM--THE PAPER BUT WILD WORDS WERE OF NO AVAIL
IN THE REAR OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT WERE KEPT SOME DOGS OF LAWYER LARKIN'S
IN THE CLOAK-ROOM SUCH A FUSS UNFURLING OF FANS AND LAST LOOKS AND HURRIED ADJUSTMENTS
ONE WAS THOMAS TUPTON OF THE TRAVELLERS HOTEL BRIGHTON
YOU ARE NOT LIKELY RACHEL TO SEE THEM AGAIN FROM THE BLUE FLASH OF THE BRILLIANTS RACHEL IN HONEST AMAZEMENT RAISED HER EYES TO HER COUSIN'S FACE
I'LL NEVER BE YOUR SLAVE
BUT HE CONTRIVED TO LEAVE UPON THE VICAR'S MIND A VERY PAINFUL AND AWFUL SORT OF UNCERTAINTY RESPECTING THE YOUNG LADY OF WHOM HE SPOKE
SO AS WYLDER HAD SET A CHAIR FOR ME I COULD NOT AVOID SITTING UPON IT THOUGH I SHOULD MUCH HAVE PREFERRED STANDING AFTER THE MANNER OF MEN AND RETAINING MY LIBERTY
HIS STRANGE EYES GLANCED NOW THIS WAY NOW THAT WITH A FIERCE RESTLESSNESS--NOW TO THE WINDOW--NOW TO THE DOOR--AND YOU WOULD HAVE SAID HE WAS LISTENING INTENTLY TO SOME INDISTINCT AND TOO DISTANT CONVERSATION AFFECTING HIM VITALLY THERE WAS SUCH A LOOK OF FEAR AND CONJECTURE ALWAYS IN HIS FACE
WE HAVE BOTH GOT SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS I FANCY TO THINK OF AND STANLEY LAKE GLIDED SLOWLY AWAY AND WAS LOST IN THE CROWD
AND HE WOULD BE FIRST J
HOW DO YOU DO?--BETTER I HOPE RADIE
I CAN THEREFORE WITHOUT BREAK OR BLUR CONTINUE MY DESCRIPTION
I WISH THERE WAS ANY WAY OF STOPPING THAT OLD SHE'--(IT LOOKED LIKE DRAGON OR DEVIL--BUT WAS TRACED OVER WITH A CLOUD OF FLOURISHES AND ONLY LADY CHELFORD'S MOUTH WAS LEFT UNTOUCHED DON'T EXPECT TO HEAR FROM ME SO LONG A YARN FOR SOME TIME AGAIN
ARE YOU BETTER NO
DORCAS IF YOUR GOOD ANGEL IS NEAR LISTEN TO HIS WARNINGS WE HAVE NO GOOD ANGELS MY POOR RACHEL
IMPOSSIBLE--_QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
YOU LOOK RATHER MELANCHOLY
D IT WHERE'S THE NOTE SAID THE CAPTAIN RUMMAGING UNEASILY IN HIS POCKETS
AND FIRST WE MUST CONSULT CHELFORD
SIR HARRY BRACTON WAS ALREADY CHAFFING A BIT AS HE EXPRESSED IT WITH THE YOUNG LADY WHO ASSISTED IN DISPENSING THE GOOD THINGS ACROSS THE SUPPER-TABLE AND WAS JUST CALLING UP HER BLUSHES BY A PRETTY PARALLEL BETWEEN HER EYES AND THE SPARKLING QUALITY OF HIS GLASS AND TELLING HER HER MAMMA MUST HAVE BEEN SWEETLY PRETTY
AS A HALO SURROUNDS A SAINT A SHADOW ROSE SUDDENLY AND ENVELOPED PALE SCENTED SMILING STANLEY WITH THE YELLOW EYES
DON'T LET ANYONE KNOW MORE
I DARE SAY MY LAST NIGHT'S ADVENTURE TENDED TO MAKE ME MORE NERVOUS AND PRONE TO EVIL ANTICIPATION
AND IN A VERY FEW WEEKS MORE I READ IN THE SAME COUNTY PAPER TRANSMITTED TO ME BY THE SAME FAIR HANDS BUT THIS TIME NOT WITH A CROSS BUT THREE DISTINCT NOTES OF ADMIRATION STANDING TREMULOUSLY AT THE MARGIN OF THE PARAGRAPH THE FOLLOWING TO ME FOR A TIME INCREDIBLE AND VERY NEARLY TO THIS DAY AMAZING ANNOUNCEMENT MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE
THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE NOTE SIR
SUCH VOLUMES OF FINE AND VARIOUS COUNTRY AIR AND SUCH AN EIGHT HOURS PROCESSION OF ALL SORTS OF NATURAL PICTURES ARE NOT TRAVERSED WITHOUT EFFECT
AND NOW THEY SLACKENED SPEED WITH A LONG PIERCING WHISTLE AND CAME TO A STANDSTILL AT EAST HAD_DON WITH A JERK UPON THE LAST SYLLABLE EAST HAD_DON EAST HAD_DON AS THE HERALD OF THE STATION DECLARED AND LAWYER LARKIN SAT STRAIGHT UP VERY ALERT WITH A BUDDING SMILE READY TO BLOW OUT INTO A CHARMING RADIANCE THE MOMENT HIS FELLOW-TRAVELLER ROSE PERPENDICULAR AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED AND PEEPED FROM HIS WINDOW
I WISH I HAD NEVER COME HERE
THE DOCTOR GREW JOCULAR
AND YOU GIVE ME A LINE ON THIS STAMP ACKNOWLEDGING THE 50_L ON ACCOUNT OF MONEY TO BE RAISED ON YOUR REVERSION
I WONDER WHAT HIS LORDSHIP THINKS
AND HIGHER UP ON A SORT OF PLATFORM THE STEEP BANK RISING HIGH BEHIND IT WITH ITS TOWERING OLD WOOD OVERHANGING AND SURROUNDING UPON A SITE WHERE ONE OF KING ARTHUR'S KNIGHTS OF AN AUTUMN EVENING AS HE RODE SOLITARY IN QUEST OF ADVENTURES MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE PEEPING GRAY GABLE OF AN ANCHORITE'S CHAPEL DIMLY THROUGH THE GILDED STEMS AND HEARD THE DROWSY TINKLE OF HIS VESPER-BELL STANDS AN OLD AND SMALL TWO-STORIED BRICK AND TIMBER HOUSE
DO WHAT YOU WILL YOU SHALL NEVER USE ME AGAIN SUPPOSE THESE HEROICS OF YOURS MISS RADIE SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO BRING ABOUT--TO BRING ABOUT THE WORST SAID STANLEY WITH A SNEER THROUGH WHICH HIS VOICE TREMBLED
SHE HAS TOO MUCH ALREADY TO TROUBLE HER THOUGH OF QUITE ANOTHER SORT
HE KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND AND DID HIS SPIRITING GENTLY
THERE WOULD BE NO MORE INTERRUPTION NOW--THE VICAR WOULD WRITE HIS SERMONS UNDISTURBED
WELL I'M THINKING TOO AND I FIND IT QUITE POSSIBLE TO BE VEXED AT THE SAME TIME
I THINK YOU'LL FIND DORCAS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM OR ELSE IN THE CONSERVATORY HE ADDED
SHE PROVOKES ME BUT I THOUGHT SHE LIKED SIR HARRY BRACTON
HER ROUTE LAY AS BY THIS TIME MY READER IS WELL AWARE BY THAT NARROW DEFILE REACHED FROM REDMAN'S FARM BY A PATHWAY WHICH SCALES A FLIGHT OF RUDE STEPS THE SAME WHICH STANLEY LAKE AND HIS SISTER HAD MOUNTED ON THE NIGHT OF MARK WYLDER'S DISAPPEARANCE
YOU'LL HEAR AND HE TURNED AWAY
THEN THEY TALKED EARNESTLY A LITTLE LONGER STANDING TOGETHER BY THE POND
OF COURSE--NAPOLEON BONAPARTE LEANING ON OLD DR SIMCOCK'S ARM ANSWERED LAKE
THE SUBJECT OF OUR CONFERENCE REALLY IS AS YOU WILL FIND AN URGENT ONE AND TO-MORROW MORNING WHICH WE SHOULD EACH EQUALLY PREFER WOULD BE POSSIBLY TOO LATE--TOO LATE AT LEAST TO OBVIATE A VERY PAINFUL SITUATION YOU WILL MAKE IT I AM SURE AS SHORT AS YOU CAN SIR SAID THE YOUNG LADY IN THE SAME TONE
THERE ARE SOME FAMILIES I THINK TOO WICKED FOR HEAVEN TO PROTECT AND THEY ARE GIVEN OVER TO THE ARTS OF THOSE WHO HATED THEM IN LIFE AND PURSUE THEM AFTER DEATH
SHE LOOKED DOWN THE SILENT WAY HE HAD SO LATELY TAKEN AND REPEATED RATHER BITTERLY MY ONLY BROTHER
POOR LITTLE FAIRY
I DON'T SUPPOSE HE CARES MORE FOR A CLERGYMAN THAN FOR ANY OTHER MAN
IT WAS A WALK OF NEARLY THREE MILES ACROSS THE PARK FROM THIS POINT TO THE HALL AND THE SLOPES AND HOLLOWS OF THIS NOBLE UNDULATING PLAIN CAME OUT GRANDLY IN THE LONG SHADOWS AND SLANTING BEAMS OF EVENING
BUT IT WAS FIXED IN HIS MIND THAT THE CARRIAGE OF HIS BUSINESS WAS SUPERNATURALLY ARRANGED
AND SHE MEDITATED A GREAT WHILE TRYING TO BRING BACK DISTINCTLY HER RECOLLECTION OF LADY CONSTANCE AND ALSO VAGUELY CONJECTURING WHO HAD ARRANGED THE MARRIAGE AND HOW IT HAD COME ABOUT
YES HE IS CLEVER
I REMAIN ALWAYS DEAR LARKIN EVER YOURS TRULY MARK WYLDER HE HARDLY TRUSTS LAKE MORE THAN HE DOES ME I PRESUME MURMURED MR LARKIN ELEVATING HIS TALL BALD HEAD WITH AN OFFENDED AND SUPERCILIOUS AIR
AND THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING BY GEORGE
HERE IS MARK WYLDER'S LETTER DEAR CHARLES--OF COURSE YOU HAVE HEARD OF MY GOOD LUCK AND HOW KIND POOR DICKIE--FROM WHOM I NEVER EXPECTED ANYTHING--PROVED AT LAST
YOU ARE VERY ODDLY HOUSED RADIE I LIKE IT SHE SAID QUIETLY ALSO WITH A GLANCE ROUND HER HOMELY DRAWING-ROOM
BUT IF YOU WILL HAVE ME SAY SO I DO SUSPECT--I THINK IT MUST HAVE ORIGINATED IN JEALOUSY OF YOU YOU LOOK RADIE AS IF YOU THOUGHT I HAD MANAGED IT--WHEREAS I REALLY DID NOT CARE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU DORCAS
YOU HAVE BEEN COMMISSIONED MA'AM I VENTURE TO THINK TO COME HERE TO WATCH THE INTERESTS OF ANOTHER PARTY I SAY SIR I DON'T IN THE LEAST COMPREHEND YOU I THINK IT IS PRETTY OBVIOUS MA'AM--MISS LAKE I BEG PARDON--YOU HAVE HAD SOME CONVERSATION WITH YOUR BROTHER ANSWERED THE ATTORNEY WITH A SIGNIFICANT SNEER
THEN GEHENNA AND THEN STAGIUM IGNIS OF COURSE ACQUIESCED LAKE WITH AN UGLY SNEER AND A MOCK BOW
THAT WICKED ATTORNEY MR LARKIN IS RESOLVED ON ROBBING THEM
RACHEL RETURNED HER LOOK AS FRANKLY WITH AN AMUSED SMILE AND THEN SAID WITH A COMIC LITTLE TOSS OF HER HEAD WELL DORCAS I DON'T SEE WHY YOU SHOULD NOT THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SAY SO YOU'RE NOT LIKE OTHER PEOPLE
THAT OTHER GIRL RACHEL--SHE'S A DEVILISH HANDSOME CRAFT
SO I WROTE HIM A YARN IN RETURN AND DREW IT UNCOMMON MILD
CHAPTER XXIV
SO GETTING ONE SEAT NEARER HE SAID WONDERFUL PLACE SHILLINGSWORTH SIR
BETTER DEAD MISS THAN LIVING ON IN SIN AND SORROW BETTER DISCOVERED THAN HID BY DAILY FALSEHOOD AND CRUELTY
BUT HE MIGHT HAVE DONE WORSE
CHAPTER XXII
WHEN MISS BRANDON RETURNED LAKE WAS UNFORTUNATELY ON DUTY BESIDE OLD LADY CHELFORD WHOM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO PROPITIATE AND WHO WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A STORY--AN EXTRAORDINARY FAVOUR FROM HER LADYSHIP
ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE ACCIDENT THERE CAME ONE OF MR MARK WYLDER'S STRANGE LETTERS TO MR JOS
AND YET THE LAWYER WAS SATISFIED AND EVEN PLEASED WITH IT AND EAT HIS LATE DINNER VERY HAPPILY
AND I HAVE I KNOW IT CALAMITY BEFORE ME
WE MUST BE SHARP
CHAPTER XIX
I MET POOR DOMINICK--WHAT AN ASS THAT CHAP IS--BUT HE DID NOT KNOW ME TILL I INTRODUCED MYSELF SO I MUST BE A GOOD DEAL CHANGED
I HAD ONCE A GOOD DEAL OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE IN THIS SORT OF BUSINESS
STANLEY LAKE THAT EMINENT LONDON SWELL HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF AS GENTLEMAN-IN-WAITING TO LADY CHELFORD'S HOUSEHOLD AND WAS PERPETUALLY GLIDING WITH LITTLE MESSAGES BETWEEN HER LADYSHIP AND THE DAPPER VOCALIST OF DOLLINGTON WHO VARIED HIS PROGRAMME AND SUBMITTED TO AN OCCASIONAL ENCORE ON THE PRIVATE ORDER THUS COMMUNICATED
HE WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURE IN THE STORY-BOOKS
CAN I DO ANYTHING RADIE
NOW NOW WE ARE ALL FRIENDS AREN'T WE SAID POOR DOLLY WHO COULD NOT MAKE ANYTHING OF THE DEBATE AND WAS STARING WITH OPEN MOUTH FROM ONE SPEAKER TO ANOTHER
IF THE BUTCHERS BOY THEN PASSING SAW THAT GAUNT AND GOOD ATTORNEY STANDING THUS IN HIS BOW-WINDOW I AM SURE HE THOUGHT HE WAS AT HIS DEVOTIONS AND ABATED HIS WHISTLING AS HE WENT BY
AT THAT MOMENT SIR HARRY BRACTON ARRIVED TO CLAIM HER AND MISS KYBES--ELDERLY AND SENTIMENTAL AND IN NO GREAT REQUEST--TIMIDLY SAID IN A GOBBLING CONFIDENTIAL WHISPER WHAT A HANDSOME COUPLE THEY DO MAKE
CHAPTER LXXI
IT DEPENDED ON THE ISSUE OF THE GREAT DEBATE THAT WAS DRAWING NIGH
AND HE DID NOT MENTION ME EITHER DORCAS SHOOK HER HEAD
NO INDEED--NOT A WORD--IT IS VERY SAD AND INVOLVES QUITE A WORLD OF TROUBLE--AND UTTERLY INEXPLICABLE
FOR A CLEVER GIRL SHE CERTAINLY DOES WRITE THE MOST WONDERFUL RUBBISH
HE WAITED NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE WHILE HE STANLEY LAKE WENT TO GYLINGDEN AND GOT HIS TAX-CART AT HIS DESIRE
THE BRANDON CONNECTION ONE WAY OR OTHER WAS WORTH TO THE ATTORNEY IN HARD CASH BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX HUNDRED A-YEAR
FOR JACK FORD AND I SPENT FIVE WEEKS IN THE HALL ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN THE FAMILY WERE AWAY AND THOUGHT THE KEEPER WAS NOT KIND TO HIM
WELL DARLING THANK YOU
HE HAD COME AND GONE UNATTENDED
LADY CHELFORD ORDERED HER HORSES AND WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE BRANDON NEXT MORNING
I MIGHT BE ALL IN THE WRONG--AND WAS NO DOUBT UNREASONABLE--FOR HE BORE A HIGH CHARACTER AND PASSED FOR A VERY GENTLEMANLIKE MAN AMONG THE VILLAGERS
AND STANLEY LAKE QUIETLY ENJOYED AS CERTAIN MINDS WILL THE NEFARIOUS AND SHABBY METAMORPHOSIS WHICH EVERY NOW AND THEN SOME FAMILIAR AND RESPECTABLE BURGESS UNDERWENT IN THE SPELL OF HALF-A-DOZEN DRY SENTENCES WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
YOU MEAN CONSTRAINT SUGGESTED LARKIN VERY CURIOUS
THE BRANDON PARTY DID NOT STAY VERY LATE
SINCE HER MARRIAGE SHE HAD NOT HINTED TO RACHEL THE SUBJECT OF THEIR OLD CONVERSATIONS
THIS AT ALL EVENTS WAS ITS LAST SERVICE
AND DORCAS COULD ALMOST FANCY TWO YELLOW LIGHTS REFLECTED UPON THE FLOOR
SOMETIMES I DO DREAM
HE FELT WITH AN UNERRING INTUITION THAT THE YOUNG LADY BOTH DESPISED AND SUSPECTED HIM
IT IS ONLY A LITTLE MATTER--I WANT TO ASK HIS OPINION--AND--OH
HE ARRIVED THIS MORNING
THERE WAS INDEED SOMETHING FEVERISH AND AT TIMES EVEN FIERCE IN HER LOOKS AND WORDS
AND TO SAY THE TRUTH I DON'T CARE
HE VERY WELL KNOWS THAT FLITTING AND SKULKING FROM PLACE TO PLACE LIKE AN ESCAPED CONVICT HE IS SAFE IN WRITING WHAT INSULTS HE PLEASES THROUGH THE POST
ITS FOUR POSTS WERE LIKE THE REST OF IT OAK WELL-NIGH BLACK FANTASTICALLY TURNED AND CARVED WITH A GREAT URN-LIKE CAPITAL AND BASE AND SHAPED MIDWAY LIKE A GIGANTIC LANCE-HANDLE
AND I RATHER THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIMSELF THAT HE WERE WHO IS HE I ASKED SPEAKING FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND SIR JULIUS WROTE TO CHELFORD SUCH AN ABSURD DESCRIPTION OF POOR MARK IN DOGGREL RHYME--SO LIKE--HIS ODD WALK HIS GREAT WHISKERS AND EVERYTHING
I'M SURE HE WILL RELIEVE YOU THIS IS BRANDON MURMURED LAKE
MONSTROUS HOT SIR--HEY
AND SOMETIMES I ADMIRE HER AND SOMETIMES I DESPISE HER
BUT SHE WOULD NOT LET IT SPEAK FROM HER PROUD LIPS
IN ONE GENERATION A WYLDER ILL-USING HIS WIFE AND HATING HIS CHILDREN WOULD CUT THEM ALL OFF AND SEND THE ESTATE BOUNDING BACK AGAIN TO THE BRANDONS
IT WAS ONLY A MOOT-POINT
HAVE I LOST YOUR LOVE FOR ASKING SO POOR A KINDNESS I'M ONLY DISAPPOINTED RACHEL
I BEG YOU'LL COLLECT YOURSELF--SHALL I CALL FOR WATER MISS LAKE THE FACT IS THE ATTORNEY BEGAN TO APPREHEND HYSTERICS OR SOMETHING EVEN WORSE AND WAS HIMSELF RATHER FRIGHTENED
REST ASSURED YOU SHALL HAVE NO CONFIDENCE OF MINE WHILE YOU DO SO STANLEY LAKE LOOKED AT HER WITH A GAZE AT ONCE PEEVISH AND INQUISITIVE
MY DEAR MR LARKIN MY DEAR SIR YOU HAVE BEEN MY PRESERVER MY BENEFACTOR--IN FACT UNDER HEAVEN VERY NEARLY MY LAST AND ONLY HOPE WELL I HAD HOPED I WAS NOT REMISS OR WANTING IN DILIGENCE AND MR LARKIN TOOK HIS SEAT IN HIS MOST GENTLEMANLIKE FASHION CROSSING HIS LONG LEGS AND THROWING HIS TALL HEAD BACK RAISING HIS EYEBROWS AND LETTING HIS MOUTH LANGUIDLY DROP A LITTLE OPEN
HE IS A SINA QUE NON
I HAVE BEEN LONG INTENDING SOME TIME OR OTHER TO CHANGE MY PLACE OF RESIDENCE PERHAPS I SHALL GO TO SWITZERLAND AND I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO SELL MY RENT-CHARGE ON THE DULCHESTER ESTATE
DON'T YOU THINK IF WE SAID A POUND A-DAY AND YOUR TRAVELLING EXPENSES CERTAINLY--_ANY_THING--WHAT_EVER YOU PLEASE SIR AND THE ATTORNEY WAVED HIS LONG HAND A LITTLE AND SMILED ALMOST COMPASSIONATELY
I KNEW YOU WOULD BE
A MESSAGE IN THAT GREAT HOUSE WAS A JOURNEY
AND WE SEE A GOOD DEAL OF ONE ANOTHER UPON THOSE TERMS AND I HAVE NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE OF HER
YOU'LL FIND TAMAR UP AND WATCHING FOR YOU--I ARRANGED ALL THAT
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT JUST NOW I REALLY CANNOT SATISFY ANY PARTICULAR ENQUIRY
HE PRODUCED NEITHER TRACT NOR NEWSPAPER NOR VOLUME--NOT EVEN A POCKET-BOOK OR A LETTER
I'LL HEAR NO SECRET STANLEY IT CAN'T BE LONG A SECRET AT LEAST FROM YOU--YOU CAN'T HELP KNOWING IT HE DRAWLED GENTLY
I WASH MY HANDS OF HIM CAPTAIN LAKE TURNED AND WALKED QUICKLY TO THE DOOR BUT CAME BACK AS SUDDENLY
I WENT TO MY BED-ROOM AND SECURED THE DOOR LEST UNCLE LORNE OR JULIUS SHOULD MAKE ME ANOTHER MIDNIGHT VISIT
SOME IDLE BOYS WERE OBSERVING THE DANDY CAPTAIN AND HE TURNED DOWN THE SHORT LANE THAT OPENED ON THE COMMON AND SAUNTERED UPON THE SHORT GRASS
WHY COULD YOU NOT LEAVE ME IN PEACE STANLEY I CAN'T GO WITHOUT YOU RACHEL
THERE IS NOT A FACT IN IT WITHOUT A NOTE OF THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE WITNESS WHO CAN PROVE IT--THE WITNESS_--OBSERVE ME THEN THERE WAS A PAUSE OF A FEW SECONDS DURING WHICH HE STILL KEPT HER UNDER HIS STEADY GAZE
AND IF YOU GO TO THE WALL WITHOUT AN EFFORT AND ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE SLURRED IN PUBLIC WHAT BECOMES OF YOUR CHANCE OF PREFERMENT AND NOW TITLE WENT UP TO BURLINGTON SMITH AND CO
LAKE RECOILED A STEP
HE HEARD HIM TALK OF RELIGION WITH DISGUST
SO HE HELPED HIMSELF AND LEANING AGAINST THE TABLE LOOKED SUPERCILIOUSLY UPON SIR HARRY WHO WAS NOT TO BE DETERRED BY THE DROWSY GAZE OF CONTEMPT WITH WHICH THE CAPTAIN RETORTED HIS ANGRY CHAFF POOR UNCLE DIED OF LOVE OR CHICKEN POX OR SOMETHING AT FORTY
WHAT WE GAIN IN KNOWLEDGE BY SCRUTINY IS SOMETIMES PAID FOR IN A GHASTLY SORT OF DISGUST
HE HAD BECOME GRADUALLY SO ABSORBED IN READING IT THAT HE LAID HIS CIGAR UNCONSCIOUSLY BESIDE HIM AND SUFFERED IT TO GO OUT
AND AS THE DAY WAS STILL AND GENIAL THEY REMAINED STANDING IN THE GARDEN
YOURS DEAR LAKE VERY FAITHFULLY M
NO--STUPID!--THAT'S MULLETT AND HOCK'S
THE CAPTAIN YOU SEE WAS BELOW WITH A HURT IN HIS LEG
BUT HE REMEMBERED HOW VERY LONG AND DARK THE PATH THAT WAY WAS AND HOW UNPLEASANT HIS ADVENTURES THERE HAD BEEN
THE PRUDENT ATTORNEY TURNED THE KEY IN THE DOOR AND FORTH CAME THE VOLUMINOUS MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT OF STANLEY WILLIAMS LAKE OF SLOBBERLIGH IN THE COUNTY OF DEVON LATE CAPTAIN C C
I AM TOLD SIX CRUMPETS AND A NEW EGG APIECE BESIDES AT TEA TO MAKE MERRY WITH AND STORIES AND LITTLE SONGS FOR FAIRY
SHE TAKES THE WHOLE AFFAIR WITH A QUEENLIKE AND SUPERNATURAL INDIFFERENCE
NO SHADOW OF TROUBLE ON THAT CALM MARBLE BEAUTY NO LIGHT OF JOY BUT A SERENE SUPERB INDIFFERENCE
SO SHE STOOD LOOKING FORTH ON HER NOBLE POSSESSIONS--ON TERRACES--'LONG ROWS OF URNS'--NOBLE TIMBER--ALL SEEN IN SLANTING SUNLIGHT AND LONG SHADOWS--AND SEEING NOTHING BUT THE GREAT WORD FOOL
FOOL I WAS TO GO NEAR HER SO THE CAPTAIN HAD TO ASSIST AT THE DOWAGER LADY'S SUPPER
AN ENEMY IN REDMAN'S DELL
IN WHICH DORCAS BRANDON SPEAKS
I FIND A NOTE IN MY DIARY OF THAT DAY:--'FROM HALF-PAST TEN O'CLOCK UNTIL TWO WITH MARK WYLDER AND MR LARKIN THE LAWYER IN THE STUDY--DULL WORK--OVER PAPERS AND TITLE--LORD CHELFORD WITH US NOW AND THEN TO LEND A HELPING HAND LAWYER LARKIN THOUGH HE MADE OUR WORK LIGHTER--FOR HE WAS CLEAR QUICK AND ORDERLY AND COULD LAY HIS HAND ON ANY PAPER IN THOSE TIN WALLS OF LEGAL MANUSCRIPTS THAT BUILT UP TWO SIDES OF HIS OFFICE--DID NOT MAKE OUR BUSINESS TO ME AT LEAST ANY PLEASANTER
THE MORE I SAW OF THIS MODEST REFINED AND MANLY PEER THE MORE I LIKED HIM
THERE WAS FIRST A FALTERING
AND SO SAID THE CAPTAIN COMING TO A STAND-STILL I'LL BID YOU GOOD-BYE LARKIN
WILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF
I WAS SO MYSELF I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM DORCAS SIT HERE A LITTLE AND REST DEAR
THIS IS OUR SECRET--YOURS AND MINE--AND WE'LL FORGET IT
AND THE TINKLE OF TINY WHEELS COMING DOWN THE ROAD WAS AUDIBLE
HE HAS A BROTHER THAT IS WALKING ABOUT IN HIS COFFIN
THOMAS WEALDON SIR
THE COMPLAINING OF THE LONELY STREAM FAR DOWN IS THE ONLY SOUND IN THE AIR
I--REALLY MISS LAKE--PARDON ME BUT THIS IS VERY IRREGULAR AND IN FACT UNPRECEDENTED SAID JOS
LAKE IS SUCH A BEAST
DESPAIR--DISTRACTION--THE FURIES SIT WITH HIM
DO YOU REALLY THINK SO NOW DON'T BLAME ME SAID MISS LAKE AND DON'T BE FRIGHTENED TILL YOU HAVE HEARD ME
IS THAT THE TIMES WHAT DOES IT SAY A LONG LEADER--NO RESIGNATION--IMMEDIATE DISSOLUTION
SHE HAD BEEN SITTING UP ALL NIGHT WITH SICK LITTLE FAIRY
LARKIN'S OPINION UPON THE MATTER WAS WORTHY OF RESPECT INASMUCH AS HE WAS HIMSELF UNDER THE ROSE THE CO OF THAT FIRM AND MINISTERED ITS CAPITAL
THE MERE SUGGESTION WAS A SNEER
AND LADIES YOU KNOW LADIES WILL BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES
REALLY DEAR TAMAR YOU MUST EXCUSE MY LAUGHING
BUT IF YOU CAN'T BE QUITE SILENT YOU HAD BETTER I FRANKLY TELL YOU DECLINE THE SITUATION EXCELLENT IN ALL RESPECTS AS IT IS I'M A MAN SIR AS CAN BE CLOSE ENOUGH SO MUCH THE BETTER
AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A CHANCE THAT THE GRAY MONKEY WAS LURKING SOMEWHERE NEAR THE PATH STILL THERE WAS NOW BUT A SHORT SPACE BETWEEN HIM AND THE BROAD CARRIAGE TRACK DOWN REDMAN'S DELL AND ONCE UPON THAT HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ALMOST IN THE STREET OF GYLINGDEN
I'VE GROWN TO FEAR STANLEY SOMEHOW LIKE A GHOST
AND HE THINKS YOU ARE LOSING YOUR SPIRITS AMONG THE GREAT TREES AND SHADOWS OF REDMAN'S DELL
IF HE IS AT THAT GIVE HIM AT THE RATE OF A HUNDRED A-YEAR OR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY IF YOU THINK HE WON'T DO FOR LESS
OTHERS THE WEALTHIER MORE IN LONDON STYLE
THEN THE YOUNG LADY PUT ON HER BONNET AND CLOAK AND WALKED DOWN TO GYLINGDEN WITH AN ANXIOUS BUT STILL A LIGHTER HEART TO SEE HER FRIEND DOLLY WYLDER
BUT NEITHER WAS I QUITE SATISFIED THAT THE THING WAS ALTOGETHER CANNY
HITHERTO THE BRANDON MEN HAVE ALL WITHOUT EXCEPTION BEEN THE WICKEDEST IN ALL ENGLAND AND THE WOMEN THE HANDSOMEST AND THE MOST SELF-WILLED
I CAN'T THINK I MEAN HE'S BEEN MADE AWAY WITH IN THAT SENSE
HE WOULD YET STAND THE HIGHEST MAN IN HIS COUNTY
I'M NOT SO WEAK AS YOU SUPPOSE YOU KNOW RADIE I'M A SADDUCEE AND THAT SORT OF THING DOES NOT TROUBLE ME THE LEAST IN THE WORLD
LAKE'S AFRAID OF YOURS M
AND WON'T YOU LET ME CALL YOU DOLLY WELL RACHEL DEAR REPLIED DOLLY LAUGHING I'M DELIGHTED YOU'RE COME
THE POSITION OF A SHY MAN WHO HAS JUST MADE AN UNINTELLIGIBLE JOKE AT A DINNER-TABLE WAS NOT MORE PREGNANT WITH SELF-REPROACH AND EMBARRASSMENT
A BILL WAS FILED BY MESSRS
ONE PAIR AT LEAST OF EYES HOWEVER WERE WIDE OPEN
I WILL COME UP AGAIN AND HE SWORE A GREAT OATH
STANLEY LAKE HAD BEEN IN MARK WYLDER'S COMPANY ONLY TEN DAYS AGO WHEN THAT GREAT MATCH WAS PLAYED AT BRIGHTON
IT WILL ALL BLOOM AGAIN AFTER THE WINTER YOU KNOW AND I THOUGHT I WOULD COME BACK AND SAY THAT AND GIVE YOU THIS RELIC OF THE BLOOM THAT IS GONE--THE LAST TOKEN AND SHE KISSED RACHEL AS SHE PLACED IT IN HER FINGERS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE AND OF HOPE I WILL KEEP IT DORKIE
AND IN THE MEANTIME HEARD IN RUDE OUTLINE THE TENOR OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING--THE MINUTE INCIDENTS AND COLOURING OF WHICH WERE AFTERWARDS FAITHFULLY COMMUNICATED
HE DID NOT HE HOPED CARE FOR MONEY MORE THAN A GOOD MAN OUGHT
LARKIN GLANCED ROUND FOR A TOPIC
IT WOULD BE VERY CONVENIENT IF YOU WOULD FAVOUR US WITH HIS ADDRESS SAID STANLEY WITH A GRACIOUS SNEER
STANLEY LAKE WAS NOT A MAN TO LET THE GRASS GROW UNDER HIS FEET WHEN AN OBJECT WAS TO BE GAINED
I FEAR IT IS EVEN WORSE THAN HE SAYS AND SHE LOOKED WITH A HORRIBLE ENQUIRY INTO RACHEL'S EYES
HE HAD JUST TIME TO SWALLOW A CUP OF COFFEE AT THE TERMINUS HOTEL AND WAS GLIDING AWAY TOWARDS THE DISTANT WALLS OF BRANDON HALL
HE HATED THAT SLY DOUBLE-DEALING REPTILE OF PREY--THE ARACHNIDA OF SOCIAL NATURE--THE SPIDERS WITH WHICH ALSO NATURALISTS PLACE THE SCORPIONS
BUT HIS FRIENDS MIGHT RELY ON SEEING HIM AT THE HUSTINGS AND HEARING HIM TOO WHEN THE PROPER TIME ARRIVED IT WAS QUITE WELL KNOWN HOWEVER IN GYLINGDEN BY THIS TIME THAT CAPTAIN LAKE WAS NOT TO SEE THE HUSTINGS--THAT HIS SPINE WAS SMASHED--THAT HE WAS LYING ON AN EXTEMPORISED BED STILL IN HIS CLOTHES IN THE LITTLE PARLOUR OF REDMAN'S FARM--CURSING THE DEAD MARE IN GASPS--RAILING AT EVERYBODY--SHUDDERING WHENEVER THEY ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE HIS CLOTHES--HOPING IN BROKEN SENTENCES THAT HIS PEOPLE WOULD GIVE BRACTON AND--GOOD LICKING
I THINK I AM BEGINNING TO GROW AFRAID OF HIM MYSELF DORCAS WAS NOT GIVEN TO SIGHING--BUT SHE SIGHED--GAZING SADLY ACROSS THE WIDE BLEAK MOOR WITH HER PROUD APATHETIC LOOK WHICH SEEMED PASSIVELY TO DEFY FUTURITY--AND THEN FOR AWHILE THEY WERE SILENT
HE'S HER BROTHER I FANCY OH SAID THE YOUNG LADY IN THAT TONE WHICH IS POINTED WITH AN UNKNOWN ACCENT BETWEEN A NOTE OF ENQUIRY AND OF SURPRISE
BUT UNQUESTIONABLY A LETTER HAS BEEN LOST--AND WHO'S TO TAKE IT LARKIN MADE A FULLER ENDORSEMENT THAN USUAL ON THIS PARTICULAR LETTER AND RUMINATED OVER THE CORRESPONDENCE A GOOD WHILE WITH HIS LIP BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB AND A SHADOW ON HIS FACE BEFORE HE REPLACED IT IN ITS IRON DRAWER
SO MUCH DID SHE DREAD THE POSSIBILITY OF AGAIN ENCOUNTERING THE PERSON SHE HAD JUST DESCRIBED
HE HAD FOUND NO DIFFICULTY HITHERTO IN SERVING GOD AND MAMMON
DUSTY AND SEEDY SOMEWHAT AS MEN ARE AFTER A JOURNEY I CHATTED WITH MARK AND THE NOBLE PEER FOR A FEW MINUTES AT THE DOOR WHILE MY VALISE AND ET CETERAS WERE LIFTED IN AND HURRIED UP THE STAIRS TO MY ROOM WHITHER I FOLLOWED THEM
NO THANK YOU NO--ANY PRAYERS I REQUIRE I CAN MANAGE FOR MYSELF THANK YOU
AND THEN THEY SHOOK HANDS
TAMAR MIGHT GLIDE IN AND OUT
AND WAGGING HIS HEAD HE ADDED RATHER LOFTILY FOR HIM MISS BRANDON I RECKON HAS TAKEN YOUR MEASURE MASTER STANLEY AS WELL AS I
AND WE USED TO DRAW HIM OUT--POOR JACK AND ME
THEN BARATHRUM
THEN AS CAUTIOUSLY AND SWIFTLY SHE RETURNED TO HER DRAWING-ROOM AND CLOSED THE WINDOW-SHUTTERS AND DREW THE CURTAIN AND SIGNALLING TO HER BROTHER THEY WENT STEALTHILY FORTH INTO THE NIGHT AIR CLOSING THE HALL-DOOR AND THROUGH THE LITTLE GARDEN AT THE OUTER GATE OF WHICH THEY PAUSED
WHAT THE D IS IT ALL ABOUT OH
HOW VERY SHORT LORD CHELFORD PAUSED WITH A SMILE AT THESE WORDS
THEY WERE NOT TO BE TAKEN UP AND LAID DOWN LIKE WAX DOLLS
I SEE DOCTOR--I SEE
WELL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TILL THEN TO LOOK ABOUT YOU
IT IS ALL MARBLE STEPS
IT IS A VERY OLD LARK HAS GOT ME INTO THIS PRESENT VEXATION
CHAPTER XVIII
NO--TO NO ONE BUT TO GOD MY LITTLE MAN
SO YOU WON'T BE FRIGHTENED SHE WAS GAZING STRAIGHT INTO HIS WILD YELLOW EYES FASCINATED WITH A LOOK OF EXPECTING TERROR
IT WAS AN IRREVOCABLE STEP AND I TOOK IT NOT SEEING ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED IT IS TRUE
LARKIN MADE HALF-A-DOZEN LITTLE ENTRIES IN HIS POCKET-BOOK WITH STATEMENT OF MR WILLIAM JOHNSON AND THE DATE OF THEIR CONVERSATION AT THE HEAD OF THE MEMORANDUM
BUT I BELIEVE SHE LOOKED A LITTLE PALE AS SHE GRAVELY ADJUSTED THE FLOWERS SO AUDACIOUSLY VIOLATED BY THE TOUCH OF THE COOL YOUNG GENTLEMAN
WHY REALLY IT IS HARDLY A FIVE MINUTES MATTER MISS LAKE
BUT I KNOW HER BROTHER--SO DOES WYLDER WHAT'S THAT SAID MARK WHO HAD JUST COME IN AND WAS TUMBLING OVER A VOLUME OF PUNCH AT THE WINDOW
BRING CANDLES MARGERY AND SO THE LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM WAS ILLUMINATED
WHAT THE DEVIL IS IT
WERE SLUMBERS SWEET AS OF OLD EVER TO KNOW IT MORE
PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT SAID RACHEL STILL STANDING AT THE DOOR OF HER LITTLE PORCH
HE FELT THAT A CRISIS WAS COMING
AND THEY LAID HIM DOWN AGAIN AND THEN HIS SPOKEN DREAMS BEGAN ONCE MORE
CONNECTED WITH THIS DOCUMENT THERE CAME TO LIGHT A CIRCUMSTANCE SO VERY ODD THAT THE READER MUST AT ONCE BE APPRISED OF IT
IT GETS HIM ALL THE RELIGIOUS BUSINESS OF THE COUNTY
IT'S NOT HAPPY AND THE ATTORNEY ROSE SHAKING HIS TALL BALD HEAD AND HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND LOOKED DOWN IN MEDITATION
THERE HAD ONCE BEEN A BOUNDARY AND A STILE THERE
THE UNCEREMONIOUS BRIDEGROOM HAS I SUPPOSE FOUND HIS WAY BACK WITH A PEACE-OFFERING IN HIS HAND AND SHE ACTUALLY PEERED THROUGH HER SPECTACLES INTO THE NOW DARKENED CORNERS OF THE CHAMBER HALF EXPECTING TO DISCOVER THE TRUANT WYLDER AWAITING THERE THE LECTURE SHE WAS WELL PREPARED TO GIVE HIM
THE ATTORNEY BEING A SHARP LONG-HEADED FELLOW WHO KNEW VERY WELL WHAT BUSINESS WAS KNEW PERFECTLY WELL TOO THAT TWO OR THREE SHORT LETTERS MIGHT HAVE SETTLED ANY LEGITIMATE BUSINESS WHICH HIS GALLANT FRIEND HAD IN THE CAPITAL
THE WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC WITH A WIDE PANEL OVER ITS DOOR PRESENTING IN TINTS SUBDUED BY TIME A STAGE-COACH AND FOUR HORSES IN MID CAREER LAY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS NEARER TO GYLINGDEN
WILLIAM WYLDER'S REVERSION WAS VERY TEMPTING
RACHEL HAS BEEN TALKING THE RANKEST NONSENSE IN THE MOST UNREASONABLE TEMPER CONCEIVABLE
LAKE AND LORD CHELFORD MAY BOTH KNOW MORE THAN THEY SAY
THERE WERE FOUR WITNESSES BESIDE MYSELF--LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JERMYN SIR JAMES CARTER LORD GEORGE VANBRUGH AND NED CLINTON
IT WAS OF COURSE A VERY GOOD THING
DON'T YOU KNOW VERY WELL IN A SMALL PLACE LIKE THIS THEY ARE ALL ALIVE WITH CURIOSITY
AND HARDLY TEN MINUTES HAD PASSED WHEN MELTON HERVEY TRUSTIEST OF AIDE-DE-CAMPS WAS ON HIS WAY TO DOLLINGTON TO MAKE A LARGE LODGMENT TO THE CAPTAIN'S CREDIT IN THE COUNTY BANK AND TO PROCURE A LETTER OF CREDIT FOR A STUPENDOUS SUM IN FAVOUR OF MESSRS
I'D UNDERTAKE TO TAKE A DOG-CART OVER THE GROUND IN TWENTY MINUTES IS LARKIN HERE I ASKED
HOW STUPID I HAVE BEEN
AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB-LIFE AND OFTEN REVELLED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
I'VE THEREFORE VENTURED TO COME MERELY TO SAY GOOD-BYE--ONLY THAT JUST--GOOD-BYE
RACHEL RACHEL IS IT POSSIBLE MURMURED THE YOUNG LADY WITH THE SAME DUBIOUS SMILE LOOKING DOWN UPON THE GROUND AND SHAKING HER HEAD
LAKE HAS GONE UP TO TOWN THIS MORNING--SOME BUSINESS WITH HIS BANKER ABOUT HIS COMMISSION--AND HE SAYS HE WILL MAKE WYLDER OUT ON HIS ARRIVAL AND WRITE TO ME SAID LORD CHELFORD
HOW CAN YOU TELL WHICH WAS IN THE WRONG
WYLDER LEANED BACK IN HIS LOW CHAIR WITH HIS HANDS STUFFED IN HIS POCKETS AND THE AIR OF A MAN TRYING TO LOOK UNCONCERNED BUT BOTH ANNOYED AND DISCONCERTED NEVERTHELESS
HE HAS MAYBE
IN FACT SIR THEY LOOK UPON IT THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY THEM AND OF COURSE THEY ARE VERY ANGRY I'M SURE I WAS WRONG
I ACCEPT WHAT YOU SAY
BUT WE CAN SPEAK OF THAT ANOTHER TIME YES--YOU'RE RIGHT
I TELL YOU SHE'S DREAMING THE SAME DREAM THAT I DREAMT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HALLO
HAS IT NOT STRUCK YOU THAT MARK WYLDER MAY POSSIBLY KNOW SOMETHING OF YOU YOU WOULD NOT HAVE PUBLISHED I DON'T THINK HE DOES
THE TWO POLICEMEN WHO CONSTITUTED THE CIVIL FORCE OF GYLINGDEN TWO JUSTICES OF THE PEACE THE DOCTOR AND A CROWD OF AMATEURS AMONG WHOM I RANK MYSELF WERE GROUPED IN THE DISMAL GORGE A LITTLE TO WINDWARD OF THE DEAD BODY WHICH FATE HAD BROUGHT TO LIGHT WHILE THREE MEN WERE NOW EMPLOYED IN CAUTIOUSLY DISINTERRING IT
WHICH OF COURSE COULD HARDLY EXCEED A SIMPLE MENTION OF YOUR ANXIETY TO BE PLACED IN COMMUNICATION WITH HIM
AT ALL EVENTS I WAS FALLING INTO A HABIT OF SEEING IT
I SAY IT IS NO BUSINESS ON EARTH OF YOURS STANLEY LAKE WAS GROWING ANGRY
OH PRECIOUS LITTLE MAN
AND RETARDING THE TRANSMISSION OF THE DOCUMENT BY AT LEAST FOUR-AND-TWENTY HOURS TO LONDON
IT WAS INDEED A HUMAN HAND AND ARM DISCLOSED FROM ABOUT THE ELBOW ENVELOPED IN A DISCOLOURED COAT-SLEEVE WHICH FELL BACK FROM THE LIMB AND THE FINGERS LIKE IT BLACK WERE EXTENDED IN THE AIR
LARKIN BEING AN ACTIVE-MINDED MAN AND PRACTICAL WITHAL IN A LITTLE WHILE SHOOK IT OFF AND FROM HIS BREAST-POCKET TOOK A TINY TREASURE OF A POCKET-BOOK IN WHICH WERE SOME BANK-NOTES PRECIOUS MEMORANDA IN PENCIL AND HALF-A-DOZEN NOTES AND LETTERS BEARING UPON CASES AND NEGOTIATIONS ON WHICH AT THIS JUNCTURE HE WAS WORKING
HOW CHEERFUL
TELL HER SO
TELL HER SO
I DON'T KNOW THAT HER PRESENCE WOULD HAVE PREVENTED HIS INVITATION FOR WYLDER'S WOOING WAS CERTAINLY OF THE COOLEST
HIS BAROUCHE WAS TO BE SMASHED AND BURNT ON THE GREEN
YET THERE CAME TO ME BY INSTINCT AN UNPLEASANT FEELING ABOUT HIM
ALL OUR WOMEN WERE SO
THERE IS NEAR THE HALL A VERY PRETTY GLEN CALLED REDMAN'S DELL VERY STEEP WITH A STREAM RUNNING AT THE BOTTOM OF IT BUT SO THICKLY WOODED THAT IN SUMMER TIME YOU CAN ONLY NOW AND THEN CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE WATER GLIDING BENEATH YOU
HE LOOKED BACK HESITATINGLY
IF YOU CAN'T KEEP A SECRET--FOR IT IS A SECRET--SAY SO
THE ARMY IS AWFULLY EXPENSIVE--I MEAN OF COURSE A REGIMENT LIKE OURS
YES INDEED STANLEY AND SO I SHALL CONTINUE TO BE UNTIL PRAY HOW DOES IT CONCERN YOU
AND THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST BY APPOINTMENT IN THE GROUNDS OF BRANDON
I HAVE CAREFULLY RECONSIDERED THE VERY HANDSOME PROPOSAL WHICH MISS LAKE WAS SO GOOD AS TO SUBMIT
NOW RADIE LISTEN TO REASON AND DON'T MAKE A NOISE
THE GONDOLA WHICH BORE THE MUSICIANS FLOATED BY--A SLENDER HAND OVER THE GUNWALE TRAILED ITS FINGERS IN THE WATER
JUST NOW DOLLY FANCIED THAT LITTLE MAN WAS BETTER--THE DARLING
RADIE LAKE--SHE'S A SPLENDID GIRL BY JOVE
IT WAS BUT CONSCIENTIOUS CAPTAIN LAKE THAT I SHOULD MAKE PARTICULAR ENQUIRY RESPECTING THE GENUINENESS OF A LEGAL INSTRUMENT CONFERRING SUCH VERY CONSIDERABLE POWERS
BUT HIS BODY'S BIN FOUND SIR YOU MEAN MR MARK YES PLEASE SIR
AND I ASSURE YOU DEAR RADIE THERE IS NOT THE LEAST TRUTH IN THAT STORY ABOUT LADY CONSTANCE WHY SHOULD DORCAS BE SO EARNEST TO CONVINCE HER HANDSOME COUSIN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THIS RUMOUR
BUT YOUR BROTHER'S INTENDED ADVANCE OF THREE HUNDRED POUNDS CAN HARDLY HAVE HAD RELATION ONLY TO THIS TRIFLING CLAIM UPON YOU
AND WHEN HE DINES AT HIS CLUB HALF-A-PINT DOES HIM
THOUGH THE WORDS YOU READ ARE SAD AND AWFUL THEY ARE ALSO SWEET LIKE FUNERAL MUSIC A LONG WAY OFF AND THEY TRANQUILLISE ME WITHOUT MAKING ME BETTER AS THE HARPING OF DAVID DID THE TROUBLED AND FORSAKEN KING SAUL SO THE OLD NURSE MOUNTED HER SPECTACLES GLAD OF THE INVITATION AND BEGAN TO READ
THEY WERE VERY BUSY TALKING
YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE DANCING
YES'M VERY TIRED'M
AND NOT KNOWING HOW THEY MEAN TO ACT AND ONLY KNOWING HOW UTTERLY WICKED CUNNING AND BLOODY-MINDED HE IS AND THAT HE HATES ME AS HE PROBABLY NEVER HATED ANYONE BEFORE I MUST BE PREPARED TO MEET HIM AND IF POSSIBLE TO BLOW UP THAT SATANIC CABAL WHICH WITHOUT MONEY I CAN'T
THAT WILL DO HE SAID AWAKING FROM HIS WANDERING THOUGHT
SO RACHEL LIGHTED HER CANDLES AND READ IT WITH VERY LITTLE INTEREST FOR IT CONCERNED A WORLD TOWARDS WHICH SHE HAD FEW YEARNINGS
LARKIN WHOM HE ALWAYS DESPISED AND NOW HATED--WHOM HE BELIEVED TO BE A FIFTH-RATE PLUCKLESS ROGUE WITHOUT AUDACITY WITHOUT INVENTION
SHE WAS EXTREMELY PROVOKED TOO AT DORCAS'S EVIDENT REPOSE UNDER THIS ASTOUNDING TREATMENT AND WAS ENIGMATICALLY SARCASTIC UPON HER WHEN THEY SAT TOGETHER IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
HE MAY FRIGHTEN YOU PERHAPS
I'LL GET A PRIVATE ACT NEXT SESSION AND REGULATE THOSE ABSURD CONDITIONS IN THE WILL
THE BATTLE OF INKERMAN WAS FOUGHT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE HUNT BALL
A VOICE AS PECULIAR AS THE APPEARANCE OF THE FIGURE SAID YOU ARE IN MY BED--I DIED IN IT A GREAT MANY YEARS AGO
RACHEL RACHEL GIRL
I DON'T THINK YOU EVER LOVED ME OR CARED WHETHER I WAS ALONE OR IN COMPANY
MARCH 28
OF COURSE THE MEN COULD NOT BE OBEYED IN ALL THINGS NOR THE WOMEN DISOBEYED
WELL THE FACT IS WHEN I REPRESENT A CLIENT SIR MULGRAVE BRACTON OF A CERTAIN RANK AND POSITION I MAKE IT A PRINCIPLE--AND AS A MAN OF BUSINESS I FIND IT TELLS--TO PRESENT MYSELF IN A STYLE THAT IS SUITABLY HANDSOME OH
WAS THERE NOT TALKATIVE IN PILGRIM'S PROGRESS I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW THINGS MORE PROVOKING THAN THAT A MAN WHO OWES YOU MONEY AND CAN'T PAY THE INTEREST SHOULD PRETEND TO RELIGION TO YOUR FACE EXCEPT PERHAPS HIS GIVING SIXPENCE IN CHARITY
AND I THINK THEY ARE ABOUT THE HAPPIEST AND I'M SURE THEY ARE THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD WELL RADIE I'LL SEE YOU TO-MORROW AGAIN
SHE'S A STRANGE GIRL SHE DOES NOT SEEM TO FEEL HER SITUATION--A MOST PAINFUL AND CRITICAL ONE
THE PICTURE OF THAT SMILE SO GAY AND FEARLESS AND YET SO FEMININE ROSE UP BESIDE THE SADDER SMILE THAT GREETED HIM NOW AND HE THOUGHT OF ONDINE WITHOUT AND ONDINE WITH A SOUL
BUT WHO'D HAVE IMAGINED WHAT'S BEFORE ME STANLEY WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND OPENED THE SHUTTER A LITTLE
2 THE OTHER WYLDER NO
I THINK IT'S ONLY TO SPOIL YOUR GAME YOU SEE ANSWERED WEALDON
HIS MIND WAS BUSY
I AM GOING TO TRY ALONE AND FOR EVER THE VALUE OF THOSE THEORIES OF FUTURITY AND THE UNSEEN WHICH I HAVE QUIETLY SCOUTED ALL MY DAYS
MR SMITH WILL TAKE NOTICE THAT THE OTHER PARTY IS DESIROUS TO PURCHASE AND BECOMING VERY PRESSING IN THE MEANTIME LAKE WAS PUSHING HIS POPULARITY AMONG THE GENTRY WITH REMARKABLE INDUSTRY AND WITH TOLERABLE SUCCESS
BUT HE DOES NOT CHOOSE TO DO IT
MRS DUTTON
MRS DUTTON
LET US HAVE ANOTHER GAME BY-AND-BY
BUT I'LL SHORTEN YOUR LONG FACE A GOOD INCH WITH A GENUINE BROAD GRIN WHEN YOU LEARN HOW IT ALL WAS
WHY SHOULD I LIKE YOUR COMPANY DORCAS SMILED A PROUD AND RATHER SAD SMILE AT THIS SUDDEN CHANGE FROM THE CONVENTIONAL TO THE PASSIONATE
BUT NOT QUITE SO DREADFUL IS THE SIGHT AS ARE THE IMAGININGS AND THE DESPAIR OF ABSENCE
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER THEN HE LOOKED SLILY AT ME LAUGHING WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
MANY MEN WHO LIVED TWO HUNDRED MILES AWAY AND MADE A FLYING VISIT ONLY ONCE IN THREE YEARS KNEW IT A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN THE LONDON-BRED RAKE WHO HAD LIVED IN THE WEST-END ALL HIS DAYS
I LIKE A LITTLE PUZZLE AND MYSTERY--THEY SURROUND OUR FUTURE AND OUR PAST
HE WAS GOING TO MARRY THE GAMEKEEPER'S DAUGHTER IT WAS THOUGHT AND HE AND THE OLD BOY WHO WAS FOR HIGH BLOOD AND ALL THAT WERE AT LOGGERHEADS ABOUT IT
BE QUICK YOU ARE WANTED THERE SAID THE ATTENDANT AS HE PASSED
AND IT WAS WELL THOUGH DESPAIR WERE IN THE PANG THAT SHE HAD AT LAST QUITE EXPLAINED THIS TO HERSELF
TUT TUT
TUT TUT
WE HAD VERY ROUGH WEATHER--A GALE FOR TWO DAYS AND A NIGHT ALMOST--AND A HEAVY SWELL AFTER
SHE KNEELED AT HER BEDSIDE AND WEPT AND PRAYED AND THEN WENT DOWN AND TALKED WITH OLD TAMAR WHO WAS KNITTING IN THE SHADE BY THE PORCH
THE GENTLEMAN WAS ABSOLUTELY MOTIONLESS AND SILENT
I WONDER WHAT THE DEUCE THE OLD DOWAGER SEES IN HIM
I'M GOING UP TO THE HALL AND I'LL TELL THEM SHE'S MUCH BETTER AND THAT I'VE BEEN IN HER ROOM AND THAT PERHAPS SHE MAY GO UP TO SEE THEM IN THE MORNING OLD TAMAR SHOOK HER HEAD AND GROANED
YOUR TEA-CADDY NOT A BAD SAFE
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE DON'T SPOIL ALL BY FOLLY NOW HE WAS OVERAWED AND DEPRECATORY
WE HAVE NOT CORRESPONDED
AND THE DOGS BEING PUT IN AND THE ATTORNEY I'M AFRAID A LITTLE SPITED AT HIS RECEPTION IN POSSESSION OF THE REINS THEY DROVE DOWN THE LITTLE STREET AT A GREAT PACE AND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE CORNER
HE HIMSELF HARDLY KNEW ALL THAT WAS PASSING IN HIS OWN BRAIN
TWO OR THREE GROUPS AND AN INVALID VISITOR OR TWO--FOR GYLINGDEN BOASTS A SPA'--WERE LOUNGING AWAY THE TWILIGHT HALF-HOURS THERE
CAPTAIN LAKE DID LOOK IN AT THE LODGE IN THE MORNING AND REMAINED AN HOUR IN CONFERENCE WITH MR JOS
I THINK THEY'LL MAKE HIM MAD
RACHEL SAT DOWN UPON ONE OF THE KITCHEN CHAIRS SCARCE KNOWING WHAT SHE DID AND STANLEY LAKE HALTED NEAR THE THRESHOLD--GAZING FOR A MOMENT AS WILDLY AS SHE WITH THE GHOST OF HIS SLY SMILE ON HIS SMOOTH CADAVEROUS FACE
I DON'T CORRESPOND WITH HIM
NO I MUST STAY AT HOME THIS EVENING--I MEAN I HAVE NOT SPIRITS TO GO TO BRANDON
AND WHEN AT LAST THE GIRL HERSELF GROWING INTERESTED IN HER OWN NARRATIVE ABOUT A KIDNAPPER GREW VOLUBLE AND ANIMATED AND LOOKED ROUND UPON THE YOUNG LADY AT THE CRISIS OF THE TALE SHE WAS SURPRISED TO REMARK ON A SUDDEN THAT SHE WAS GAZING VACANTLY INTO THE BARS
AND LAKE SAID IN HIS CLEAR LOW TONE ON A SUDDEN JUST AS HE SPOKE WHEN PERFECTLY WELL QUITE A MISTAKE UPON MY HONOUR AS A CLEAR-VOICED SENTENCE SOMETIMES SPEAKS OUT IN SLEEP FOLLOWED BY SILENCE SO NO MORE WAS HEARD AFTER THIS--NO MORE FOR EVER
I AM AFRAID THAT PART OF HER EDUCATION WHICH DEALS WITH FUTURITY HAD BEEN NEGLECTED
THE WRITING WAS NEARLY WASHED AWAY BUT THE LETTERS LWICH OR TWICH WERE STILL LEGIBLE NEAR THE CORNER AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A LETTER TO DULWICH WHICH MARK WYLDER HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PUT IN THE GYLINGDEN POST-OFFICE ON THE LAST NIGHT ON WHICH HE APPEARED AT BRANDON
LARKIN'S COUNTENANCE WHICH STRUCK THE VICAR AND HE SAID YOU DON'T SEE ANY OBJECTION AND PAUSED
I SHALL DIE TO-NIGHT
THERE HAS PLAINLY BEEN A LETTER LOST MANIFESTLY
YOU'LL BE HAPPIER THAN EVER--BUT NOT HERE
THIS LITTLE EXCURSION TO LONDON WOULD COST HIM AS I SAID EXACTLY L5 3_S IT MIGHT HAVE COST HIM L13 10_S AND AT THAT SUM HIS EXPENSES FIGURED IN HIS LEDGER
AND HE RETURNED HER GLANCE FOR A SECOND WILDLY AND THEN DROPPED HIS EYES TO THE GROUND
YOU'LL FORGIVE ME I HOPE MRS WYLDER HE ADDED WITH A PLAYFUL CONDESCENSION FOR RUNNING AWAY WITH YOUR HUSBAND BUT ONLY FOR A FEW MINUTES--HA HA THE SHADOW WAS UPON JOS
THANK YOU AGAIN SAID STANLEY
SO FAR DEAR LADY CHELFORD FROM PROVOKING ME TO THIS DECISION HIS ABSENCE IS I ASSURE YOU THE SOLE REASON OF MY HAVING DELAYED TO INFORM HIM OF IT AND I ASSURE YOU MISS BRANDON I SHA'N'T UNDERTAKE TO DELIVER YOUR MONSTROUS MESSAGE
I NEVER DID THINK TO SEE MR WYLDER SO AFFEARD OF LAKE
CHAPTER XXVI
HOW FAR AWAY HOW NEAR TO SILENCE YET HOW CLEAR
AND I HOPE AT ALL EVENTS THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD THAT MARK WYLDER WILL SOON RETURN AND LOOK AFTER HIS OWN BUSINESS--I'M QUITE TIRED OF IT AND OF HE WAS GOING TO SAY YOU_)--'OF EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH IT THIS DELAY IS ATTENDED WITH MORE SERIOUS MISCHIEF
BUT RACHEL HAS MADE SUCH A ROW ABOUT IT
YOU MAY MADAM I REGRET TO OBSERVE HAVE RUINED MY CLIENT SAVED HIM I HOPE AND RUN YOURSELF MADAM INTO A VERY SERIOUS SCRAPE UPON THAT POINT YOU HAVE SAID QUITE ENOUGH SIR
DON'T THANK ME--DON'T SAY ANYTHING NOW
THERE LAY HER BROTHER SUCH AS HE WAS--STILL HER BROTHER ON THE BLEAK NEUTRAL GROUND BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH
IT IS A VERY PRETTY POETICAL PARALLEL AND MISS KYBES WAS PLEASED TO THINK THAT CAPTAIN LAKE WOULD BE SURE TO REPORT HER ELEGANT LITTLE COMPLIMENT IN THE PROPER QUARTERS AND THAT HER INCENSE HAD NOT MISSED FIRE
IT OFTEN STRUCK ME AS A GREAT MISTAKE THAT WHERE THERE IS A GOOD INCOME AND A POSITION TO BE MAINTAINED THERE IS NOT A LITTLE PUT BY EVERY YEAR TO MEET CASES LIKE THIS--WHAT THEY CALL A RESERVE FUND IN TRADING COMPANIES I DO NOT THINK THERE IS MUCH MONEY
RELATING HOW A LONDON GENTLEMAN APPEARED IN REDMAN'S DELL
THE BARONET WAS SUDDEN AND VEHEMENT IN HIS AFFAIRS OF THE HEART
AND WHEN HIS JEALOUSY WAS EVER SO LITTLE TOUCHED POSITIVELY IMPERTINENT
HE SAID THAT ON THE NIGHT OF MARK WYLDER'S LAST VISIT TO BRANDON HE HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM FROM THE HALL
IT IS IN FACT THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS RUIN
LARKIN CONTINUED TO STARE ON HIM IN SILENCE WITH HIS ROUND EYES FOR SOME SECONDS AFTER
YOUR COUNTENANCE MISS LAKE--YOU MUST PARDON MY FRANKNESS IT IS MY WAY--_YOUR COUNTENANCE TELLS ONLY TOO PLAINLY THAT YOU NOW COMPREHEND MY ALLUSION THERE WAS A CONFIDENCE AND SIGNIFICANCE IN THE ATTORNEY'S AIR AND ACCENT AND A PECULIAR LOOK OF LATENT FEROCITY IN HIS EVIL COUNTENANCE WHICH GRADUALLY EXCITED HER FEARS AND FASCINATED HER GAZE
I WAS FACING A DOOR ABOUT TWENTY FEET DISTANT WHICH EXACTLY AS I OPENED MY EYES TURNED SLOWLY ON ITS HINGES AND THE FIGURE OF UNCLE LORNE IN HIS LOOSE FLANNEL HABILIMENTS INEFFACEABLY TRACED UPON MY MEMORY LIKE EVERY OTHER DETAIL OF THAT ILL-OMENED APPARITION GLIDED INTO THE ROOM AND CROSSING THE THICK CARPET WITH LONG SOFT STEPS PASSED NEAR ME LOOKING UPON ME WITH A MALIGN SORT OF CURIOSITY FOR SOME TWO OR THREE SECONDS AND SAT DOWN BY THE DECLINING FIRE WITH A SIDE-LONG GLANCE STILL FIXED UPON ME
AS HE TOOK IT FROM THE SALVER HE RECOGNISED LARKIN'S VERY CLEAR AND LARGE HAND
I CAN'T WAIT--I SHA'N'T BE AWAY TWENTY MINUTES--TIME ENOUGH WHEN I COME BACK HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING OF MARK DARLING SHE ENQUIRED EAGERLY
HE MAY STAY WHERE HE IS--LET HIM--I'LL NOT RETURN
THEY COULD ACT AND SPEAK
THE CHAPEL WAS GROWING DARK AND ITS STONE AND MARBLE COMPANY OF BYGONE WYLDERS AND BRANDONS WERE LOSING THEMSELVES IN SHADOW
AND THROUGH THE SUBTLE ABSORBENTS OF YOUR SYMPATHY HE INFUSES INTO YOU SOMETHING OF HIS OWN HILARIOUS AND EXULTING SPIRIT
BUT NEVER AGAIN TO BE THE SAME--THE CARELESS MIND NO MORE
THE SUMMER SUNSHINE THROUGH THE TREES THE LEAFY SONGS OF BIRDS OBSCURED IN THE SMOKE AND DROWNED IN THE DISCORD OF AN UNTOLD AND EVERLASTING TROUBLE
ALL THIS CHICANERY WILL YET BREAK DOWN AND THE CONSPIRACY BE IT WHAT IT MAY WILL BE THOROUGHLY EXPOSED
I NEVER TAKE ANY AND A LITTLE WOULD BE SO GOOD FOR YOU AND POOR NURSE
DIDN'T PLAY WITH THEM A MINUTE SAID THE MAID
BUDDLE THOUGHT HE WAS IN SO HIGHLY EXCITED A STATE THAT HIS BRAIN MUST HAVE SUSTAINED SOME INJURY ALSO
HE GLANCED TO THE OTHER END OF THE CARRIAGE WHERE SAT HIS SOLITARY FELLOW-PASSENGER
AND MARK WYLDER WHO HAD INTENDED RENEWING HIS TALK WITH MISS LAKE SAW THAT SHE HAD FOILED HIM AND STOOD WITH A HEIGHTENED COLOUR AND HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LOOKING CONFOUNDEDLY CROSS AND VERY LIKE AN OUTCAST IN THE SHADOW BEHIND
IT WAS VERY UNREASONABLE OF ME TO THINK OF TROUBLING YOU WITH MY WRETCHED AFFAIRS
LARKIN WAS AWAY FOR LONDON
CHAPTER XXIII
AS THE DOCTOR TODDLED TOWARDS GYLINGDEN WITH SYMPATHETIC MAJOR TACKSON BY HIS SIDE BEFORE THEY ENTERED THE TOWN THEY WERE PASSED BY ONE OF THE BRANDON MEN RIDING AT A HARD CANTER FOR DOLLINGTON
SO HERE TOO HE LEFT A LITTLE NOTE TO THE SAME PURPOSE
LARKIN HAD A WEAKNESS FOR ENVELOPING MUCH OF WHAT HE SAID AND WROTE IN AN HONOURABLE MYSTERY
BUT NOTHING OF THE KIND TOOK PLACE AND THE OCULAR EXERCISES OF THE ATTORNEY WERE TOTALLY INEFFECTUAL
AND CHATTED WITH HIM AS LADIES WILL
THE LEARNED ARCHBISHOP BRANDON A CADET WHO FILLED THE SEE OF YORK IN HIS DAY AND WAS THE ONLY UNEXCEPTIONABLY GODLY PERSONAGE OF THAT LONG LINE WAS PRAYING AS USUAL AT HIS DESK--PERHAPS TO THE SAINTS AND VIRGIN FOR I BELIEVE HE WAS BEFORE THE REFORMATION--IN BEARD AND SKULL-CAP AS WAS EVIDENT FROM THE BLACK PROFILE OF HEAD AND UPLIFTED HANDS AGAINST THE DIM SKY SEEN THROUGH THE CHAPEL WINDOW
THE NURSE WAS THE FIRST TO PERCEIVE THE CHANGE THERE'S A CHANGE MA'AM'--AND THERE WAS A PAUSE
ONLY FOR MR LARKIN IT NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND INDEED I DON'T THINK IT WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN THOUGHT OF I HOPE HE HAS SOME ONE TO ADVISE HIM SAID MISS LAKE ANXIOUSLY
VENOUS YOU KNOW--ONLY VENOUS THE MAJOR THOUGHT HE SPOKE OF THE GODDESS AND THOUGH HE DID NOT WELL COMPREHEND SAID HE WAS GLAD OF IT THINK HE'LL DO THEN HE MAY--VERY UNLIKELY THOUGH
ALTOGETHER YOUR LORDSHIP WILL PERCEIVE THAT THE SITUATION IS ONE OF CONSIDERABLE INDEED VERY GREAT EMBARRASSMENT AS RESPECTS ME
BEFORE HE HAD WALKED FIVE MINUTES IN THIS DIRECTION HE WAS ENCOUNTERED BY A LITTLE GIRL IN A CLOAK WHO STOPPED AND DROPPED A COURTESY
I KNEW VERY WELL WHOSE IT WAS AND WATCHED HER COUNTENANCE
SO THE ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THE PRESENT WERE SUSPENDED
IT WAS JUST WHAT SHE WISHED TO ESCAPE
BUT YOU CAN'T PERSUADE ME IT IS QUITE SO PLEASANT FOR THOSE WHO HAPPEN TO LIVE UNDER THE SAME ROOF AND ARE LIABLE TO BE INTRUDED UPON AS WE HAVE BEEN TO-NIGHT EVERY HOUR OF THEIR EXISTENCE WELL CERTAINLY IT IS NOT PLEASANT ESPECIALLY FOR LADIES ADMITTED THE TOWN CLERK
DON'T YOU REMEMBER POOR PALE WINNIE THE MAID WHO USED TO TAKE US ON OUR WALKS ALL THE SUMMER AT DAWLING
MARK WYLDER YOU KNOW OF COURSE HAS TURNED UP AGAIN IN ENGLAND
WELL IF STANLEY LAKE WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS HORRID CONSPIRACY HE CERTAINLY HAD A MOTIVE IN CLEARING THE FIELD OF HIS RIVAL
AND TO YOU I NEED NOT
HE WAS THINKING WHAT HAD BEST BE DONE IN ANY AND EVERY CONTINGENCY
IT HAS BROUGHT ME TO THIS
WHOM HE WAS ON THE POINT OF TRIPPING UP THAT HE SHOULD HAVE TURNED SHORT AND GAROTTED THE GALLANT CAPTAIN WAS A PROVOKING TURN OF FORTUNE
THE PEOPLE OF GYLINGDEN KNEW VERY WELL THAT WHEN THE RAT-LIKE GLITTER TWINKLED IN MR LARKIN'S EYES AND THE SHADOW CAME OVER HIS LONG FACE THERE WAS MISCHIEF BREWING
MR WYLDER'S CONFIDENTIAL SOLICITOR ACTING SOLELY FOR HIM IN A MATTER OF A STRICTLY PRIVATE NATURE THE ATTORNEY STOOD ERECT A LITTLE FLUSHED WITH THAT PECULIAR CONTRACTION MEAN AND DANGEROUS IN HIS EYES
HIS COOL IMPERTINENCE AND ESPECIALLY THIS CUNNING PRECAUTION INCENSED OLD LADY CHELFORD
OLD TAMAR DID NOT STOP AT REDMAN'S FARM
WHY SHOULD NOT HE DO AS WELL AS ANOTHER
THERE SAID THE ATTORNEY VERY PEREMPTORILY AND MAKING A LITTLE FURROW IN THE THICK PAPER WITH THE SEAL END OF HIS PENCIL
I WOULD SO LIKE DOLLY TO COME AND LIVE WITH YOU
GOING FOR THE DOCTOR MA'AM
I LONG TO HAVE A GOOD TALK WITH YOU DORKIE
LET ME IN
LET HIM ALONE WHISPERED THE TOWN CLERK IN A SIGNIFICANT WHISPER DON'T CROSS HIM AND HE'LL NOT STAY LONG YOU_'RE HERE A SCRIBE MURMURED UNCLE LORNE LOOKING UPON TOM WEALDON
YOU'LL THINK IT PRETTY--A GOLD RING WITH A STONE IN IT--IT BELONGED TO POOR DEAR AUNT JEMIMA YOU REMEMBER
IT WAS A PECULIAR CONCENTRATED VIGILANCE AND RAPINE THAT I HAVE SEEN THERE
WHAT YOU CAN DO TO SAVE ME MAY AMOUNT TO NOTHING BUT IT MAY BE EVERYTHING AND YOU SAY YOU WON'T TRY
ANYTHING YOU LIKE FOR THE FIRST TIME HER BROTHER STOOD BEFORE HER IN A REALLY TERRIBLE SHAPE
LARKIN IS LIKELY TO FIGURE ONCE MORE IN THE COURTS ABOUT SOME VERY UGLY DEFALCATIONS IN THE CASH OF THE PENNINGSTAL MINING COMPANY AND THAT THIS TIME THE PERSECUTIONS OF THAT EMINENT CHRISTIAN ARE LIKELY TO TAKE A DIFFERENT TURN AND AS TOM SAID WITH A GLOOMY SHREWDNESS TO END IN TEN YEARS PENAL SOME SUMMERS AGO I WAS FOR A FEW DAYS IN THE WONDROUS CITY OF VENICE
SHE HAD HEARD HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS LOOKING FROM THE WINDOW AT THE TOWERING AND SOMBRE CLUMPS OF HER ANCESTRAL TREES--PALE PROUD WITH PERHAPS A PECULIAR GLEAM OF RESENTMENT--OR MALIGNITY--IN HER EXQUISITE FEATURES
HE STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF A DREADFUL MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH SHE SAW HIM AMBIGUOUS AND AWFUL
TOM WEALDON LOOKING ODD TOO WAS CLOSE AT HIS ELBOW AND HAD HIS HAND ON LAKE'S ARM LIKE A MAN WHO WOULD PREVENT VIOLENCE
DUST TO DUST
A WILD VOICE WAS TALKING THIS WAY TO-AND-FRO AND UP AND DOWN IN THE CHAMBERS OF MEMORY
SHE BLANCHED BEFORE IT--EVERY VESTIGE OF COLOUR FLED FROM HER FEATURES--SHE STARED--SHE GAPED AT HIM WITH A STRANGE LOOK OF IMBECILITY--AND THE LONG FACE SEEMED TO ENJOY AND PROTRACT ITS TRIUMPH
LAKE STROLLED INTO THE BALL-ROOM AND ON TO THE UPPER END WHERE THE BEST PEOPLE ARE AND SUDDENLY HE WAS IN MISS BRANDON'S PRESENCE
COME TAMAR AND KISS ME FOR I AM FREE ONCE MORE SO THAT NIGHT PASSED PEACEFULLY
CHAPTER XXV
THE HUNT BALL
AND HE YOU KNOW HAS LETTERS FROM HIM AND MR LARKIN THINKS KNOWS MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE ABOUT HIM
DID THEY
BUT I NEVER YET KNEW A DIVIDED DIRECTION COME TO GOOD
I'M VERY WELL NOW SHE SAID GENTLY
BUT THE SITUATION THE EXCUSE AND THE RESULT WERE PRESENT TO HIS MIND AND FILLED HIM WITH A COMFORTABLE ASSURANCE
YOU KNOW WE AGREED YOU MUST GO AND I CAN'T GO WITH YOU LAKE WAS COOLER BY THIS TIME AND HIS SISTER MORE EXCITED THAN BEFORE THEY WENT OUT
AND TAMAR HER ROUND SPECTACLES BY THIS TIME ON HER NOSE SITTING AT THE LITTLE TABLE BY HER PILLOW READ IN A SOLEMN AND SOMEWHAT QUAVERING VOICE SUCH COMFORTABLE PASSAGES AS CAME FIRST TO MEMORY
DO YOU RECOLLECT RADIE WHAT I SAID THAT MORNING WHEN I FIRST CALLED HERE AND SAW YOU PERHAPS I DO BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN ANSWERED SHE
IT IS FAIR TO MENTION HOWEVER THAT YOUR KNOWING IT WILL MAKE YOU FULLY AS ODIOUS TO HIM AS I AM--AND THAT I ASSURE YOU IS VERY ODIOUS INDEED
AND ASKED HIM NEXT FOR HIS GOOD FRIEND MR JOHNSON
IN WHICH I ENTER THE DRAWING-ROOM
AND HIS PRAYER WAS--'I THANK THEE THAT I AM NOT AS OTHER MEN ARE SPIRITUALLY PROUD FORMALISTS HYPOCRITES OR EVEN AS THIS PHARISEE DO YOU WISH ANOTHER GAME I ASKED
AND HER MAID ENTERED TO SAY THAT THE CARRIAGE PLEASE MA'AM WAS AT THE DOOR TO TAKE MISS LAKE HOME
SHERIDAN LE FANU FIRST PUBLISHED 1864 CONTENTS CHAP
I AM SO VERY SLOW AND SO SILLY ABOUT BUSINESS AND YOU SO MUCH MY FRIEND--I HAVE FOUND YOU SO--THAT YOU MIGHT THINK ONLY OF ME I SHOULD OF COURSE CONSIDER THE LITTLE BOY SAID MR LARKIN CONDESCENDINGLY
AND YET IT WAS IMMENSE
BUT WHAT WAS TO BE DONE WITH MERE LONDON WYLDER WAS HIDDEN FROM MORTAL SIGHT LIKE A HEAVEN-PROTECTED HERO IN THE ILIAD AND A CLOUD OF INVISIBILITY GIRDLED HIM
BUT IS NOT THERE A TIME MR WYLDER WHEN HE SHALL HAVE SHUT TO THE DOOR AND ARE THERE NOT SOME WHO CRYING TO HIM TO OPEN SHALL YET REMAIN FOR EVER IN OUTER DARKNESS I SEE DEAR MISS LAKE THAT YOUR MIND IS AT WORK--IT IS A GOOD INFLUENCE--AT WORK UPON THE GREAT THEME WHICH EVERY MORTAL SPIRIT OUGHT TO BE EMPLOYED UPON MY FEARS ARE AT WORK
MR LARCOM'S FEARS NOW NATURALLY SUBSIDED AND CURIOSITY AS NATURALLY SUPERVENED
LORD EDWARD MORDUN READ IT
YOU SEE THE FACT IS MY DEAR MR WYLDER I NEVER MEDDLE IN SPECULATIVE THINGS
TAKE MY ARM SAID LAKE
AND SILENT AS MUTES AT A FUNERAL THEY WALKED ON AND SOON THE FALL OF THEIR FOOTSTEPS WAS HEARD NO MORE AND I RE-ENTERED THE HALL AND SHUT THE DOOR
BY-THE-BYE HERE'S YOUR BAG
THE TREMENDOUS CONTEST IMPENDING OVER THE COUNTY WAS OF COURSE THE THEME
OLD TAMAR'S TIRED OF LIFE
SOONER OR LATER JUDGMENT WILL OVERTAKE YOU SO SURE AS YOU PERSIST IN IT
MY ONLY BROTHER THAT YOUNG LADY WAS NOT QUITE A PAUPER THOUGH SHE MAY HAVE THOUGHT SO
IT WAS NOT INDEED QUITE DARK YET
AND CAPTAIN LAKE GLANCING FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES THIS WAY AND THAT WITHOUT RAISING OR TURNING HIS FACE STOPPED LISTLESSLY AT THE TIME-WORN WHITE STONE AND TURNING TO THE OLD CRONE WHO WAS BY HIS SIDE HE SAID WELL THEN YOU HAVE YOUR WAY
BUT NOW IT IS DIFFERENT AND HE MUST MARRY YOU THE YOUNG LADY STARED WITH A HAUGHTY AMAZEMENT UPON HER BROTHER
INDEED HE NEVER LOST AN OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A PERSON OF RANK
YOU WILL BE IN A WORSE POSITION THAN EVER UNLESS YOU BOLDLY RAISE A THOUSAND POUNDS--IF I CAN MANAGE SUCH A TRANSACTION UPON A SECURITY OF THE KIND
OF COURSE I PROMISE UPON YOUR HONOUR UPON MY HONOUR--_THERE I BELIEVE YOU GENTLEMEN DRAGOONS OBSERVE THAT OATH--I HOPE SO
IT WAS A GUST--VIOLENT--SOON OVER
LARKIN I MEAN WAS THINKING OVER MISS DORKIE'S SHARE IN THE DEED WITH A COMPLACENT SORT OF INTEREST ANTICIPATING A STRUGGLE BUT SURE OF VICTORY--THAT BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY WAS WALKING SLOWLY FROM FLOWER TO FLOWER IN THE SPLENDID CONSERVATORY WHICH PROJECTS SOUTHWARD FROM THE HOUSE AND REARS ITSELF IN GLACIAL ARCHES HIGH OVER THE SHORT SWARD AND FLOWERY PATTERNS OF THE OUTER GARDEN OF BRANDON
WELL HE CAN'T LOOK BETTER YOU KNOW DEAR TILL THERE'S A DECIDED CHANGE
I HAVE TOLD HER FIFTY TIMES OVER AND SHE SEEMS TO GIVE WAY AT THE MOMENT
SLIM AND TALL HE GLIDED A CHASTENED DIGNITY IN HIS LONG UPTURNED COUNTENANCE AND A FAINT HALO OF SAINT-HOOD ROUND HIS TALL BALD HEAD
THE FACT IS HE WAS ENGAGED OVER A LETTER THE WRITING OF WHICH CONSIDERING HOW ACCOMPLISHED A GENTLEMAN HE WAS HE HAD FOUND RATHER LABORIOUS AND TEDIOUS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WITH A SCISSORS HE CLIPT HIS OWN NAME WHERE IT OCCURRED FROM THE THIN SHEET AND THEN IN RED INK AND ROMAN CAPITALS HE SCRAWLED A LINE OR TWO ACROSS THE INTERIOR OF THE LETTER ENCLOSED IT IN AN ENVELOPE DIRECTED IT AND THEN RANG THE BELL
AND HE WAS CALLED UPON TO PAY FORTHWITH TEN POUNDS FOR PREMIUM AND FOUR POUNDS TEN SHILLINGS FOR EXPENSES QUOD IMPOSSIBILE THE ATTORNEY HAD NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO TRY TO INDUCE THE LENDER TO LET HIM HAVE ANOTHER FIFTY POUNDS PENDING THE INVESTIGATION OF TITLE--ANOTHER FIFTY OF WHICH HE WAS TO GET IN FACT EIGHTEEN POUNDS
AND THEN WITH TIME CAME HEALING OF THESE SORROWS
BUT TO CHANGE MY WAY OF LIFE IS A DREAM THAT DOES NOT TROUBLE ME
HE MAY BE A TRUSTEE BUT THAT'S NOT LIKELY
I RATHER THINK HE HAD NO PARTICULAR WISH TO TAKE LORD CHELFORD INTO COUNCIL
THE SHOCK OF HER BRIEF INTERVIEW WITH HER BROTHER OVER REFLECTION ASSURED HER KNOWING ALL SHE DID THAT STANLEY'S WOOING WOULD PROSPER AND SO THIS CAUSE OF QUARREL HAD REALLY NOTHING IN IT
SIT DOWN BY ME RACHEL
AND THIS SO INTO HIS RED SLIPPERS HE SLID AND GOT HIS GREAT SHAWL DRESSING-GOWN SUCH AS FINE GENTLEMEN THEN WORE ABOUT HIS SLENDER PERSON AND KNOTTED THE SILKEN CORDS WITH DEPENDING TASSELS AND GREETED JIM DUTTON AGAIN IN VERY FRIENDLY FASHION ENQUIRING VERY PARTICULARLY HOW HE HAD BEEN EVER SINCE AND WHAT HIS MOTHER WAS DOING
I FORGOT TO ASK HIM WHERE HE IS STAYING
FROM THE CAPTAIN'S DEED TO THE VICAR'S HIS MIND GLANCED FONDLY
LAKE DINED AT BRANDON THAT EVENING AND THOUGH LOOKING ILL WAS VERY GOOD COMPANY AND PROMISED TO BRING AN EARLY REPORT OF RACHEL'S CONVALESCENCE IN THE MORNING
HA HA BY JOVE SAID MAJOR JACKSON WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM THE SUPPER-ROOM WHERE HE HAD HEARD SEVERAL NARRATIVES OF THE OCCURRENCE
WAS STANLEY--HER HUSBAND--WHOSE CHARACTER SHE HAD BEGUN TO DISCERN WHOSE HABITUAL MYSTERY WAS SOMEHOW TINGED IN HER MIND WITH A SHADE OF HORROR ONE OF THIS TWO-FACED DIABOLICAL ORDER OF HEROES
DOES HE SPEAK TO YOU NOT A WORD MY LORD
I'M NOT QUITE SURE I SUPPOSE HE THIS I'M MADE OF MONEY
BUT IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE IT MAY BE TRUE IF IT IS YOU KNOW SIR SAID JOS
OR FROM PROSECUTING HIS SMALL SPITES WITH A PATIENT AND VIRULENT INDUSTRY
HIS SAVINGS IF THE GOOD MAN CHOSE TO PRACTISE SELF-DENIAL WERE HIS OWN--AND IT WAS A SORT OF PROBLEM WHILE HE STAYED AND INTERESTED HIM CURIOUSLY--KEEPING DOWN HIS BILL IN MATTERS WHICH HE WOULD NOT HAVE DREAMED OF DENYING HIMSELF AT HOME
HE APPEALS IMPERCEPTIBLY TO YOUR AFFECTIONS WHICH CANNOT BE STIRRED--SUCH IS GOD'S WILL--EVER SO LIGHTLY WITHOUT SOME LITTLE THRILLINGS OF HAPPINESS
INDEED THE THING IS TOO PLAIN TO BE RESISTED
I HALF BELIEVE IN PRESENTIMENTS AND I FELT ONE NOW IN THE CHILL AIR THE SUDDEN SILENCE AND THE WATCHFUL GAZE OF THE MOON
BUT AS MR WILLIAM WYLDER'S SOLICITOR AND AS I HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED TO HIM I MUST NOW INFORM YOU THAT THE SUM OF SIX HUNDRED POUNDS WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY USELESS IN HIS POSITION
AS HE ENTERED THE FLOWER-GARDEN THE JAUNDICED FACE OF OLD TAMAR WITH ITS THOUSAND SMALL WRINKLES AND ITS OMINOUS GLEAM OF SUSPICION WAS LOOKING OUT FROM THE DARKENED PORCH
SIT DOWN MARGERY I'M ONLY HERE BY PERMISSION
ALWAYS IN ADVANCE--ALWAYS DRAINED TO THE UTTERMOST SHILLING AND I AM MYSELF IN THE PREDICAMENT YOU WILL SEE THERE AND HE THREW A LITTLE NOTE FROM THE DOLLINGTON BANK TO JOS
HE TURNED SUDDENLY AWAY TALKING THE WHILE BUT WITH HIS EYES UPON THE NOTE AND THEN HE FOLDED OR RATHER CRUMPLED IT UP AND STUFFED IT INTO HIS POCKET AND CONTINUED HIS TALK
A TINY BROOK THAT MAKES ITS WAY AMONG BRIARS AND SHINGLE TO THE MORE CONSIDERABLE MILL-STREAM OF REDMAN'S DELL SENT UP A HOARSE BABBLING FROM THE DARKNESS BENEATH
AS RESPECTS RACHEL WE KNOW HOW UNJUST WAS THE ATTACK
THE HEART OF MAN IS DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS AND DESPERATELY WICKED
STANLEY LAKE DID NOT CARE TO SMASH ANY MAN EXCEPT SUCH AS STOOD IN HIS WAY
WILL YOU READ THE NOTE NO SAID DORCAS QUIETLY
FOR SOME TIME OLD TAMAR HEARD THE CLATTER IN HER SLEEP
WHAT DREAMS WERE HENCEFORWARD TO HAUNT IT
SO WE LAID DOWN OUR CUES WITH THE CUSTOMARY EJACULATIONS OF SURPRISE
HIS BOW WAS OF THAT GRAVE BUT MOCKING SORT WHICH WAS MEANT TO CONVEY IT
SHERIDAN LE FANU
I HAVE SUCH GOOD NEWS--BUT I CAN'T TELL IT TILL I THINK FOR A MINUTE--I MUST BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING ANYWHERE EVERYWHERE ONLY IF IT IS GOOD NEWS LET ME HEAR IT AT ONCE
WHEN THE BUTLER REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE HAD TURNED HE FOUND HIMSELF ALL AT ONCE WITHIN FIFTY STEPS OF THAT ECCENTRIC GENTLEMAN WHO WAS TALKING BUT IN SO LOW A TONE THAT NOT EVEN THE SOUND OF THE VOICES REACHED HIM WITH A RATHER SHORT BROAD-SHOULDERED PERSON BUTTONED UP IN A SURTOUT AND WEARING A QUEER GERMANESQUE FELT HAT BATTERED AND CRUSHED A GOOD DEAL
THE BLONDE AND THE DARK IT WAS A DAZZLING CONTRAST
PEOPLE COMPLAINED THAT ACQUAINTANCE MADE LITTLE WAY WITH HER
BUT YOU SEE IF A FELLOW HASN'T HIS LIBERTY WHERE'S THE GOOD OF MONEY
AND THE REVEREND WILLIAM WYLDER MIGHT HAVE NO MORE CHANCE OF THE ESTATES THAN HE HAD OF THE CROWN
SHE HAD JUST THAT SYMMETRICAL THREE HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR WHICH THE FAMOUS DEAN OF ST PATRICK'S TELLS US HE SO OFTEN WISHED THAT HE HAD CLEAR SHE HAD HAD SOME MONEY IN THE FUNDS BESIDES STILL MORE INSIGNIFICANT BUT THIS HER BROTHER STANLEY HAD BORROWED AND BEGGED PIECEMEAL AND THE CONSOLS WERE NO MORE
AND IN A MOMENT MORE WE DREW UP AT THE GREAT GATE ON THE LEFT
AND AS SHE LISTENED TO MRS CRINKLE'S BABBLE OVER THE COUNTER AND CHOSE HIS TOYS FOR POOR LITTLE FAIRY SHE FELT LIKE ONE TRIFLING ON THE WAY TO EXECUTION
MY LITTLE MAN YOU MUST NOT DO THAT
NEW LIGHTS
BUT IT IS DIFFERENT DORCAS AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT
CHAPTER III
H
THIS WAS THE COURT WHERE DAME DUTTON DWELT
POOR MORTALS
CHELFORD DOES NOT LIKE PERSONALITIES BUT HE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING
IT WAS VERY FOOLISH OF ME TO EXPECT FROM MR WYLDER'S FRIEND ANY OTHER ANSWER
ONLY IT WOULD NOT DO FOR ANYONE TO OPEN IT AND RUN UP TO THE ROOM AS THEY MIGHT SO DON'T FORGET TO SECURE THE DOOR WHEN I GO
CHAPTER XXXVI
I MEANT TO SPEAK TO HIM AND END ALL BETWEEN US
WYLDER AND LAKE HAD A WALK BEFORE THEM AND WE BID LORD CHELFORD GOOD-NIGHT IN THE PASSAGE AND I WALKED WITH THEM THROUGH THE DESERTED AND NEARLY DARKENED ROOMS
IN WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE MEETS A FRIEND NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE
WHAT HE MOST NEEDED WERE ASCERTAINED DATA
AND THAT'S HOW I THINK IT'S GONE WITH HIM
IT WAS SO MANY WEEKS AFTER THE HUNT BALL THAT THE CZAR NICHOLAS DIED
THE INNER MAN HAD BEST BE KNOWN ONLY TO HIMSELF AND HIS MAKER
AND THE VISCOUNT SEEING IT AGREED THE BEST THING FOR HER AS WELL AS ME WOULD BE WE SHOULD MARRY
IN FACT COMPARED WITH OTHER YOUNG FELLOWS HE WAS A BIT OF A SCREW
HOW CAN I HELP IT NOW WHAT'S YOUR QUARREL
I HAVE JUST SEEN BY ACCIDENT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MARRIAGE AT BRANDON
HE IS ENDOWED WITH EMINENT TALENTS FOR BUSINESS AND MUST PERFECTLY APPRECIATE THE EMBARRASSMENT IN WHICH THE MYSTERY WITH WHICH HE SURROUNDS THE PLACE OF HIS ABODE MUST INVOLVE THOSE WHOM HE HAS APPOINTED TO CONDUCT HIS BUSINESS I HAVE HEARD FROM HIM THIS MORNING RESUMED THE LAWYER
LONG DID THE ATTORNEY PORE OVER HIS COPY OF THE WILL WITH HIS FINGER AND THUMB CLOSED ON HIS UNDER LIP
WYLDER IS SUCH A FELLOW
NOTHING OF THE SORT
NOTHING OF THE SORT
IT WAS STILL EARLY IN THE DAY
THERE WAS TO BE NO WEAKNESS OR PASSION IN HER REIGN
AND HE WAS NOW HARANGUING FROM THE STEPS OF THE COURT HOUSE
AND THE VICAR EVIDENTLY MUCH TROUBLED IN MIND HAVING RUN UP TO THE NURSERY TO SEE HIS LITTLE MAN THE TWO LADIES SET OUT TOGETHER
HAD SHE OVERHEARD A PART OF THAT UNWORTHY TALK OF WYLDER'S AT THE DINNER-TABLE THE DAY BEFORE AND MISTAKEN RACHEL'S SHARE IN THE DIALOGUE
BUT HE'LL NOT HEAR IT
THEN HE BECAME ELOQUENT ON THE MADNESS OF FURTHER INDECISION IN A STATE OF THINGS SO FEARFULLY MENACING FREELY ADMITTING THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCOMPARABLY BETTER FOR THE VICAR NEVER TO HAVE MOVED IN THE MATTER THAN HAVING PUT HIS HAND TO THE PLOUGH TO LOOK BACK AS HE HAD BEEN DOING
CAPTAIN LAKE WAS IN LONDON THIS MORNING
EVERYTHING AS HE SAID WAS DOING VERY NICELY AND IT WOULD BE A DEPLORABLE THING TO MAR BY ANY UNTOWARD ACT THIS PILGRIM'S QUIET AND PROSPEROUS PROGRESS
LARKIN WAS LEFT TO RUMINATE WITHOUT ANY NEW LIGHT UPON THE DUSKY LANDSCAPE NOW CONSTANTLY BEFORE HIS EYES
I DO NOT LIKE HIM MYSELF AND DORCAS BRANDON DISLIKES HIM TOO
I'LL GO AND SEE YOU--UPON MY HONOUR I WILL--TO-MORROW OR NEXT DAY AT THE DELL
HE BOLTED HIS DOOR AND UNLOCKED HIS DRESSING CASE AND FROM A LITTLE SILVER BOX IN THAT GLITTERING REPOSITORY HE TOOK ONE AFTER THE OTHER TWO OR THREE LITTLE WAFERS OF A DARK HUE AND PLACED THEM SUCCESSIVELY ON HIS TONGUE AND SUFFERED THEM TO MELT AND SO SWALLOWED THEM
HE STOPPED WITH HIS FINGERTIPS TO HIS EYEBROW AND THOUGHT MORE
AND TELL HIM I HAVE A PROMISE OF THE ADJUTANCY OF THE COUNTY MILITIA IF HE LIKES THAT
FOR TO SPEAK FRANKLY MR LARKIN MY CIRCUMSTANCES ARE VERY PRESSING
BUT I WAS PASSIVE
AND INTEREST AS WE SEE WAS NOT TRIFLING
HOW ARE YOU WILLIAM RACHEL GREW DEADLY PALE AND THEN FLUSHED AND THEN WAS PALE AGAIN
I THINK SIR YOU'VE GOT HIM INTO SOME FOREIGN MAD-HOUSE OR PLACE OF CONFINEMENT AND I WON'T STOP TILL IT'S SIFTED TO THE BOTTOM
BUT DOES STANLEY--HE CAN HARDLY HOPE DORCAS REMOVED HER ARMS FROM HER COUSIN'S NECK
HE DID NOT SAY DISTINCTLY
RAILING AT MARK WYLDER WAS ALAS
THE TREASURE
AND THE NURSE SAID HE'D LIKE TO BE DOZIN SIR HE'S SO TIRED PLEASE SO DOWN THE POOR LITTLE FELLOW LAY HIS WAPSIE PRAYING BY HIS BEDSIDE
AND NOW HE CAME UPON THE WIDER PLATEAU FROM WHICH THE CLOSE COPSE RECEDING ADMITTED SOMETHING MORE OF THE LIGHT FAINT AS IT WAS THAT LINGERED IN THE HEAVENS
IN ITALY SAID THE OLD MAN REFLECTIVELY AS IF TRYING TO GATHER UP HIS IDEAS ITALY
YOU WERE ALWAYS THE SAME CLOSE DARK AND CROOKED AND WISE IN YOUR OWN CONCEIT
AND 150_L._?--NO SUCH SUM HAS BEEN MENTIONED
IT IS A FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF MEN NOT OF GOD
I AM SUBJECTED TO THE MOST AGONISING SUSPICIONS AND INSULTS
IS STANLEY SHOT NOT SHOT
BUT IT IS NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE BULLET AND THE OPERATION WILL BE CRITICAL AND IT IS FOR THAT SPECIALLY THAT SIR FRANCIS IS COMING DOWN IT IS TO TAKE PLACE TO-MORROW AND HE'LL DIE IN THAT OPERATION
HAD YOU NOT BETTER ENQUIRE MR CRUTCHLEIGH
I REMEMBERED HIM BUT MORE DIMLY THAN HIS MERRY LITTLE WIFE THOUGH SHE WENT FIRST
IT WAS A VERY AWKWARD PAUSE
YOU HAVE FRIGHTENED RACHEL OUT OF THE ROOM FOR ONE THING ANSWERED HE WITH A SNEER
THE LITTLE MAN WAS SOLITARY AND THESE RAMBLES WERE A DELIGHT
LAKE HAS GOT PRIVATE DIRECTIONS ABOUT THE DISPOSITION OF A PORTION OF THE MONEY
NO SIR--NOTHING CAPTAIN LAKE
I HAVE EVERYTHING I WANT
AFTER A LITTLE MORE TALK LAKE AND THE TOWN CLERK RESUMED THEIR ELECTIONEERING CONFERENCE AND THE LISTS OF ELECTORS WERE PASSED UNDER THEIR SCRUTINY NAME BY NAME LIKE SLIDES UNDER THE MISCROSCOPE
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT A GREAT TEMPTATION AND A CONTUMACIOUS HUSBAND MIGHT BRING ONE TO
AND HAVING GIVEN HIS DIRECTIONS TO THE MAID HE WENT HOME IN HASTE AND RETURNED IN HALF AN HOUR WITH THE SOMETHING IN A PHIAL--A FEW DROPS IN WATER AND LITTLE MAN SAT UP LEANING ON HIS WAPSIE'S ARM AND TOOK IT VERY GOOD HIS NURSE SAID APPROVINGLY
HOW ON EARTH SIR COULD I HAVE THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION THAT YOU HAD SEEN MY CLIENT MR WYLDER CONSIDERING THE TENOR OF YOUR LETTERS AND CONVERSATION
I EXPECTED HE WOULD SHOW FIGHT AND THAT A MEETING WOULD FOLLOW
SILENTLY SHE HANDED HER LITTLE BLACK LEATHER BAG TO HER BROTHER AND THEN THERE WAS A PAUSE
BUT THIS APATHETIC BEAUTY HAD EITHER MORE MORAL COURAGE OR MORE STUPIDITY THAN I AND WAS PLAINLY TERRIBLY INDIFFERENT ABOUT THE CATASTROPHE
YOU DON'T LAKE'S HAND WITH WHICH HE CLUTCHED AND PULLED CHELFORD'S WAS TREMBLING
LARKIN WAS NOT GIVEN TO FANCY NOR TROUBLED WITH SUPERSTITION
I AM TOLD THAT HE SHIFTS HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE ABOUT ONCE IN SIX MONTHS AND THAT HE HAS NEVER PAID ONE SHILLING OF RENT FOR ANY AND HAS SOMETIMES POSITIVELY RECEIVED MONEY FOR VACATING HIS ABODE
HE'S AWFUL COWED HE IS
NOW AS TO MY THINKING OF REPRESENTING EITHER COUNTY OR BOROUGH HE RESUMED AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE HOLDING MARK WYLDER'S NOTICE BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB AND GLANCING AT IT FROM TIME TO TIME AS A SPEAKER MIGHT AT HIS NOTES I AM JUST AS WELL QUALIFIED AS HE IN EVERY RESPECT
AND I MUST GO BACK WITH HIM FOR I HAVE NOT BEEN VERY WELL--INDEED I'VE BEEN I MAY SAY VERY ILL--AND I TOLD THAT FELLOW LARKIN WHO HAS HIS EYES ABOUT HIM AND WOULD WONDER WHAT KEPT ME OUT SO LATE THAT I WOULD RUN DOWN TO SOME OF THE PLACES NEAR FOR A CHANGE AND SLEEP A NIGHT THERE
SO HE WAS GETTING ON VERY PLEASANTLY WITH HIS NEW NEIGHBOURS AND WAS LIKELY TO STAND VERY FAIRLY IN THAT DULL BUT NOT UNFRIENDLY SOCIETY
ANNUAL PREMIUM ON A POLICY FOR L100 DOUBLE INSURANCE L S D BEING INSISTED UPON BY LENDER TO COVER CONTINGENT EX 10 0 0 PENSES AND LIFE NOT INSURABLE A DELICACY OF THE LUNGS BEING ADMITTED ON THE ORDINARY SCALE ANNUITY PAYABLE TO LENDER CLEAR OF PREMIUM THE 7 10 0 SECURITY BEING UNSATISFACTORY
WHY EXACTLY HE HALTED THERE HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID
ITS PROMPTINGS ARE BLASPHEMOUS
HOW AWFULLY HE COMPREHENDED THE REASONABLENESS OF THE THANKSGIVING WHICH HE HAD READ THAT DAY IN THE CHURCHYARD--'WE GIVE THEE HEARTY THANKS FOR THAT IT HATH PLEASED THEE TO DELIVER THIS OUR BROTHER OUT OF THE MISERIES OF THIS SINFUL WORLD WITH THE ATTORNEY IT WAS DIFFERENT
AND THE STYLE OF HIS DRESS BEING THE SAME HELPED THE ILLUSION
HOW ON EARTH DO YOU GET OVER THE DAY AND WORSE STILL THE EVENINGS VERY WELL--WELL ENOUGH
THEREFORE LITTLE BY LITTLE LIKE A FLOWER THAT HAS BEEN BRUISED IN THE TRANQUILLISING INFLUENCES ABOUT HER THE YOUNG LADY GOT UP EXPANDED AND GREW LIKE HERSELF AGAIN--NOT LIKE ENOUGH INDEED TO SAY MUCH BUT TO LISTEN AND FOLLOW HIS MANLY REFINED AND PLEASANT TALK EVERY MOMENT WITH A PANG THAT HAD YET SOMETHING PLEASURABLE IN IT CONTRASTING THE QUIET AND CHIVALRIC TONE OF HER PRESENT COMPANION WITH THE FEROCIOUS DUPLICITY OF THE SLY SMOOTH TERRORIST WHO HAD JUST LEFT HER SIDE
CHARITY LET US REMEMBER THINKETH NO EVIL BY-THE-BYE SAID LAKE RATHER BRISKLY FOR HIM RUMMAGING HIS POCKETS I'M GLAD I REMEMBERED HE GAVE ME A LITTLE NOTE TO CHELFORD
WON'T THAT DO
WHEN HE WAKENED UP IN THE BUZZ AND CLACK OF TONGUES THAT FOLLOWED THE CLOSE OF THE GAME CAPTAIN LAKE GLARED ROUND FOR A MOMENT LIKE A MAN CALLED UP FROM SLEEP
I HAVE JUST BEEN LOOKING AT THE PLANT YOU USED TO ADMIRE SO MUCH AND THE LEAVES ARE SHED ALREADY AND IT REMINDED ME OF OUR FRIENDSHIP RADIE
LADY CHELFORD AND MISS BRANDON I SUPPOSE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM SO TO THE DRAWING-ROOM HE PASSED
AND HE WOULD WRITE SHARPLY TO BURLINGTON SMITH AND CO AND HAD NO DOUBT THE COSTS WOULD BE SETTLED FOR TWENTY-THREE POUNDS
AND THE EVIDENCE IN HIS POCKET BEING PRETTY SOON EXHAUSTED HE GLANCED AGAIN AT HIS COMPANION OVER THE WAY
THAT IS VERY ODD SAID CAPTAIN LAKE
AT ALL EVENTS SHE DID NOT AND AFTER A WHILE THE PRESENT ONE GOT INTO A DECIDEDLY SINKING CONDITION
THEN SOME TIME AFTER I FANCIED I HEARD A CREAKING STEP ON THE LOBBY OUTSIDE AND CANDLE IN HAND OPENED THE DOOR AND LOOKED OUT WITH AN ODD SORT OF EXPECTATION AND A RATHER AGREEABLE DISAPPOINTMENT UPON VACANCY
CAPTAIN LAKE WAS SINKING VERY FAST NEXT MORNING
MR WYLDER IS MY CLIENT AND I WAS BOUND TO SAY I WAS NOT SATISFIED ABOUT HIS PRESENT POSITION WHICH SEEMS TO ME UNACCOUNTABLE EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT HE IS UNDER RESTRAINT OF SOME SORT
WHERE THE DEVIL HAVE YOU BEEN--TAKE HIM AWAY
LET ME HAVE THE ENTIRE STORY JUST AS YOU USED TO TELL IT SO OLD TAMAR WHO KNEW IT WAS NO USE DISPUTING A FANCY OF HER YOUNG MISTRESS ALTHOUGH ON SUNDAY NIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED OTHER TALK RECOUNTED HER OLD TALE OF WONDER
I'LL SEND SOME TO YOU SO COMING DOWN STAIRS RACHEL SAID IS THE VICAR AT HOME YES HE WAS IN THE STUDY AND THERE THEY FOUND HIM BRUSHING HIS SEEDY HAT AND MAKING READY FOR HIS COUNTRY CALLS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE TOWN
BUT FAR MORE DREADFUL TO ME THE MYSTERY IN WHICH I HAVE LIVED EVER SINCE
LARKIN URGED HIS POINT WITH ALL SORTS OF ARGUMENTS ALWAYS PLACING THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IN THE MOST PLAUSIBLE LIGHTS AND ATTITUDES AND HANDLING HIS SUBJECT IN ROUND AND FLOWING SENTENCES
THE BRANDON ARMS I SUPPOSE
AND HOW IS MARK ENQUIRED LAKE WITH HIS ODD SLY SMILE AS HE SCRAWLED A LITTLE ENDORSEMENT ON THE ORDER
GO OR STAY I'M EQUALLY RUINED NOW BUT NOT EQUALLY DISGRACED
BLESS YOU DEAR MISS RADIE WHERE SHOULD I FIND A STORY
DOTTED WITH STRAGGLING BIRCH AND OAK AND HERE AND THERE A HOARY ASH TREE WITH A GRAND AND MELANCHOLY GRACE DREAMING AMONG THE SONGS OF WILD BIRDS IN THEIR NATIVE SOLITUDES AND THE BROWN LEAVES TIPPED WITH GOLDEN LIGHT ALL BREATHING SOMETHING OF OLD-WORLD ROMANCE--THE POETRY OF BYGONE LOVE AND ADVENTURE--AND STIRRING UNDEFINABLE AND DELIGHTFUL EMOTIONS THAT MINGLE UNREALITY WITH SENSE A MUSIC OF THE EYE AND SPIRIT
BUT THE CLOUDS HAD BEGUN TO BREAK AND THE SKY TO CLEAR OVER THE GOOD VICAR JUST AT THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD BEEN DARKEST AND MOST MENACING
SIR JULIUS'S REPLY WAS OF THE HOITY-TOITY AND ROLLICKING SORT BORDERING IN PARTS VERY NEARLY ON NONSENSE AND GENERALLY IMPERTINENT
HERE YES MA'AM THIS HALL-DOOR
THEN HE WAS LIFTED UP AND KISSED AND SMILED ON BY THAT SUNSHINE ONLY REMEMBERED IN THE SAD OLD DAYS--PARENTAL LOVE
STRIKE HER ON THE HEAD
IS NOT IT ODD
THE SKY AS HE LOOKED TOWARD BRANDON WAS DRAPED IN BLACK CLOUD INTENSELY BLACK MEETING A BLACK HORIZON--EXCEPT FOR ONE LITTLE RENT OF DEEP CRIMSON WHICH SHOWED WESTWARD BEHIND THOSE ANTIQUE GABLES AND LORDLY TREES LIKE A LAKE OF BLOOD
STANLEY LAKE LEFT OLD LADY CHELFORD'S SIDE AND GLIDED TO THAT OF DORCAS BRANDON
AND TO SAY TRUTH I DON'T THINK THE DIAMONDS HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO IT OH?--HEM!--WELL YOU KNOW I_'M NOT EXACTLY THE CONFIDANT MR WYLDER WOULD CHOOSE I SUSPECT IN A CASE OF THAT VERY PAINFUL AND I WILL SAY DISTRESSING CHARACTER--I RATHER THINK--INDEED I HOPE NOT NO OF COURSE--I DARE SAY--BUT I JUST FANCIED HE MIGHT WANT A HINT ABOUT THE LAW OF THE MATTER THE GRACIOUS ATTORNEY GLANCED AT HIS GUEST WITH A THOROUGHLY BUSINESS-LIKE AND SEARCHING EYE
MISS BRANDON TOOK OLD TAMAR'S HAND GENTLY AND PRESSED IT
SO NOT CARING TO STAY LONGER AND SEEING NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY TURNING BACK THE ATTORNEY BUTTONED THE TOP BUTTON OF HIS COAT AND HOLDING HIS HEAD VERY ERECT AND PLACING AS MUCH AS HE COULD OF THE PATH BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE SIDE WHERE THE FIGURE HAD DISAPPEARED MARCHED ON STEADILY
AND THESE WORDS WERE VERY DISTINCT--IN FACT THEY STUNTED DOWN THE VICAR'S REVERSION IN THE GREATER PART OF THE PROPERTY TO A STRICT LIFE ESTATE
STILL THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF HOLDING IN A HORSE-HAIR
SHE COULD ONLY LOOK HER WILD SUPPLICATION;--DELIVERANCE--AN ISSUE OUT OF THE TERRORS THAT BESET HER
THE WHOLE TOWN WAS IN A FERMENT THAT NIGHT
FOR HE FELT A PANG OF REPROACH AT PASSING HER DOOR
IT WAS MY DETERMINATION IT SHOULD NOT BE
IF YOU HAD A PARTICLE OF GRATITUDE YOU'D BUILD A TEMPLE TO FORTUNE--YOU'RE PAGAN ENOUGH FOR IT MARK FORTUNE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT SAYS MARK LAUGHING AGAIN
THENCE AGAIN TO ILCHESTER WHENCE MY FIERY AND DECISIVE OLD AUNT SENT IT STRAIGHT BACK TO MY COUSIN WITH A WHISK OF HER PEN WHICH SEEMED TO SAY HOW THE PLAGUE CAN I TELL WHERE THE PUPPY IS?--'TIS YOUR BUSINESS SIR NOT MINE TO FIND HIM OUT AND SO MY COUSIN DESPATCHED IT TO MY HEAD-QUARTERS IN TOWN WHERE FROM THE TABLE IT LOOKED UP IN MY FACE WITH A BROAD RED SEAL AND A COUNTENANCE SCARRED AND MARRED ALL OVER WITH VARIOUS POST-MARKS ERASURES AND TRANSVERSE DIRECTIONS THE SCARS AND FURROWS OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND ADVENTURE
BUT CHELFORD TOLD ME THAT ONE OF THE LONDON PEOPLE SAID HE THOUGHT FIVE OAKS BELONGED TO ME ABSOLUTELY IN THAT CASE THE INHERITANCE IS DISMEMBERED ALREADY I WILL HAVE NO SHARE IN SELLING THE OLD ESTATE OR ANY PART OF IT TO STRANGERS STANLEY EXCEPT IN A CASE OF NECESSITY
I MEET MARK WYLDER IN THREE PLACES SOMETIMES
THE FIGURE WAS VISIBLE--THAT OF A SHORT BROADISH MAN WITH A MASS OF CLOAKS RUGS AND MUFFLERS ACROSS HIS ARM
IS IT THOUGHT THE WRITS WILL FOLLOW THE DISSOLUTION UNUSUALLY QUICKLY THEY MUST UNLESS THEY WANT A VERY LATE SESSION
NOR IS THERE ANY PRIVATION IN LIVING AS I DO
BUT YOU APPEAR TO ME VERY CRUEL AND YOU SMILE AS I SAY SO I SMILE BECAUSE I SOMETIMES THINK SO MYSELF WITH A FIXED AND WRATHFUL STARE RACHEL RETURNED THE ENIGMATICAL GAZE OF HER BEAUTIFUL COUSIN
SINGING IN OUR DROWSY EARS LIKE ARIEL--VISITING OUR REVERIES LIKE ANGELS OF LIGHT--BEING REALLY OUR EVIL GENII--AH YES DORCAS DEAR SAID RACHEL AFTER BOTH HAD BEEN SILENT FOR A TIME SPEAKING SUDDENLY AND WITH A LOOK OF PALE AND KEEN ENTREATY--'BEWARE OF STANLEY--OH
HE HAD STAVED OFF SOME OF HIS TROUBLES BY A LITTLE LOAN FROM AN INSURANCE COMPANY BUT THE PREMIUM AND THE INSTALMENTS WERE DISPROPORTIONED TO HIS REVENUE AND INDEED VERY NEARLY FRIGHTFUL TO CONTEMPLATE
AND REALLY I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD POSSIBLY HOLD YOUR OWN AMONG THE PARTIES WHO ARE PRESSING YOU WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE I FEEL SAID THE POOR VICAR AND HIS EYES FILLED AS HE SMILED AND HIS LIP QUIVERED A LITTLE--'I FEEL AS IF MY PRAYER FOR DIRECTION AND DELIVERANCE WERE ANSWERED AT LAST
HE MUST HANG OUT THE SIGNAL IN GALIGNANI LAKE COULD NEVER SUSPECT ITS MEANING EVEN WERE HE TO SEE IT
WELL ABOUT CHELFORD
YOU'LL GET THE SCRIP YOU KNOW ON EXECUTING BUT THE SHARES ARE ALLOTTED
IT WAS HOWEVER ON THE WHOLE BETTER SPELLED AND EXPRESSED THAN THE PENMANSHIP WOULD HAVE LED ONE TO EXPECT
HE OUGHT TO BE SHOT THE KEEPER SILENTLY SLID HIS ARM INTO UNCLE LORNE'S AND UNRESISTING THE OLD MAN TALKING TO HIMSELF THE WHILE DREW HIM FROM THE ROOM
I MAY HAVE SPOKEN WITH WARMTH FEARING THAT YOU MIGHT BE ACTING UNDER SOME CRUEL MISAPPREHENSION--THAT'S ALL
AND THE ANGELS IMPRISONED MARK
AND UPON THIS STAGE DIRECTION THE LITTLE PIECE OF BY-PLAY TOOK PLACE AND THE YOUNG LADY COLDLY TOUCHED THE CAPTAIN'S HAND AND PASSED ON
AND THERE WERE ONE OR TWO TRIFLES IN THE CAPTAIN'S ATTITUDE AND COSTUME OF WHICH THE ATTORNEY WHO AS WE KNOW WAS NOT ONLY GOOD BUT ELEGANT MADE A NOTE
FOR SO THE SCRIPTURE SAYS--"CURSED IS THE GROUND FOR THY SAKE"--HARD TO THE BODY--A VALE OF TEARS--DARK TO THE SPIRIT
SIR JULIUS HOCKLEY'S LETTER
SUPPOSE MY DEAR SIR THEY SHOULD PROCEED TO ARREST YOU OR TO SEQUESTRATE THE REVENUE OF YOUR VICARAGE
SIR FRANCIS SEDDLEY RETURNED TO LONDON ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON WITHIN A WEEK AFTER THE OPERATION BUDDLE BEGAN TO TALK SO CONFIDENTLY ABOUT HIS PATIENT THAT THE FUNEREAL CLOUD THAT OVERHUNG BRANDON HAD ALMOST TOTALLY DISAPPEARED AND MAJOR JACKSON HAD QUITE UNPACKED HIS PORTMANTEAU
AND YOU KNOW YOUR HUSBAND DOES NOT UNDERSTAND BUSINESS IS IT MR LARKIN MY DEAR
HE WAS THINKING YOU MAY BE SURE OF HIS BROTHER MARK
I WAS VEXED WITH MYSELF FOR HAVING MANAGED WITH SO LITTLE SKILL A CONVERSATION WHICH OPENED SO ODDLY AND FRANKLY MIGHT HAVE PLACED ME ON RELATIONS SO NEARLY CONFIDENTIAL WITH THAT SINGULAR AND BEAUTIFUL GIRL
BUT I OPENED IT
AND HE HELD HER SLENDER HAND FROM WHICH SHE HAD DRAWN THE GAUNTLET IN HIS
THE BALL ROOM
BUT HE DOES NOT CARE FOR SHOOTING AND I DON'T THINK MR LARKIN'S SOCIETY CAN AMUSE HIM
IT WAS HIS LOFTY ARISTOCRATIC STARE
MISS RACHEL LAKE BECOMES VIOLENT
I BELIEVE I THOUGHT I WAS DOING A DUTY
WE KNOW HE CAME ABOUT ELECTIONEERING MATTERS
THE DOGS WERE SNIFFING AND YELPING ABOUT IT
OLD GENERAL LAKE HAD ONCE HAD MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR AND LIVED UNTIL THE CRASH CAME IN THE STYLE OF A VICIOUS OLD PRINCE
WHAT A CHARMING DAY SAID HE WITH HIS PLEASANT SMILE RAISING HIS HAT AND HOW VERY PLEASANT TO SEE YOU AT YOUR PRETTY INDUSTRY AGAIN AS RACHEL CAME FORWARD IN HER FADED GARDENING COSTUME AN OLD SILK SHAWL ABOUT HER SHOULDERS AND HOODWISE OVER HER HEAD SOMEHOW VERY BECOMING THERE WAS A BLUSH--HE COULD NOT HELP SEEING IT--ON HER YOUNG FACE AND FOR A MOMENT HER FINE EYES DROPPED AND SHE LOOKED UP SMILING A MORE THOUGHTFUL AND A SADDER SMILE THAN IN OLD DAYS
HE WAS SUSPECTED OF HAVING MURDERED HIS OWN SON AT THE EDGE OF A TARN IN THE PARK
RACHEL'S MORE THAT WAY
IT IS TRUE THAT I WAS AT DOLLINGTON AND AT CHARTERIS ON THE NIGHT YOU NAME
RACHEL MADE NO REMARK AND THERE WAS A LITTLE SILENCE
SO WHEN A SMOOTH EXPANSE RECEIVES IMPREST CALM NATURE'S IMAGE ON ITS WATERY BREAST DOWN BEND THE BANKS THE TREES DEPENDING GROW AND SKIES BENEATH WITH ANSWERING COLOURS GLOW
WHILE STANLEY LAKE IS THUS SCANNING THE SHABBY BUT DANGEROUS IMAGE OF THE ATTORNEY IN THE MAGIC MIRROR BEFORE HIM THAT EMINENT LIMB OF THE LAW WAS NOT INACTIVE IN THE QUIET TOWN OF GYLINGDEN
IT'S ALL D--D NONSENSE KEEPING HIM HERE--DID YOU SEE HIM AT THE DOOR?--HE WAS ON THE POINT OF ASSAILING SOME OF US
PERHAPS ON SECOND THOUGHTS HE RIGHTLY JUDGED THAT LEVERETT KNEW NO MORE THAN HE DID OF THE MATTER
THANK GOD MY DARLING SAID THE VICAR
OLD MAJOR JACKSON WITH HIS GLASS IN HIS EYE WAS CONTENDING IN HIS SHIRT-SLEEVES HEROICALLY WITH A MANCHESTER BAG-MAN WHO WAS PALPABLY TOO MUCH FOR HIM
HANG MOPING AND NONSENSE
BUT IT'S A BIN A BAD ROW AND I SUSPECK AMOST HE'S USED VILINS COMPULSION I SUPPOSE
BUT THERE WAS AN UNWONTED DIFFICULTY IN FINDING ANYTHING TO SAY
MAY I SEE WYLDER'S NOTE--THAT IS IF THERE'S NO PRIVATE BUSINESS OH CERTAINLY AND WITH WYLDER'S GREAT RED SEAL ON THE BACK OF THE ENVELOPE THE LETTER RAN THUS DEAR LARKIN,--I WRITE IN HASTE TO SAVE POST TO SAY I SHALL BE DETAINED IN TOWN A FEW DAYS LONGER THAN I THOUGHT
IS WYLDER AT ALL DEFINITE AS TO WHEN WE MAY EXPECT HIS RETURN OH DEAR NO--QUITE AS USUAL--HE EXPECTS TO BE HERE SOON
HE WANTED THE SEAT AND WOULD STICK AT NOTHING TO SECURE IT
I NEVER SAID YOU WERE TO BLAME
THEY WERE AN ILL-CONDITIONED RACE--THAT IS TO SAY EVERY NOW AND THEN THERE EMERGED A MISCREANT WITH A PRETTY EVIDENT VEIN OF MADNESS
LARKIN--EXCEPT WHEN MAKING A MYSTERIOUS TRIP AT ELECTION TIMES OR IN AN EMERGENCY IN A CRITICAL CASE--WAS A FRANK AND AS HE BELIEVED COULD BE A FASCINATING COMPAGNON DE VOYAGE SUCH AND SO GREAT WAS HIS URBANITY ON A JOURNEY
WEALDON'S MY MAN
IT IS ODD HOW MANY OF OUR FAMILY MARRIED FOR LOVE--WILD LOVE-MATCHES
AND SO HE AND HIS WITH CLEVER MANAGEMENT WOULD BE ANYTHING BUT NOVI HOMINES IN THE COUNTY
THERE WAS A GREAT LOWERING PRESS OF OAK AND SOME SHELVES WITH WITHERED GREEN AND GOLD LEATHER BORDERS
THE CIGAR WAS DELICIOUS THE AIR BALMY AND PLEASANT HIS DIGESTION HAPPY THE SOCIETY UNEXCEPTIONABLY ARISTOCRATIC--A STEP HAD JUST BEEN GAINED AND HIS CONSIDERATION IN THE TOWN AND THE COUNTRY ROUND IMPROVED BY THE OCCURRENCES OF THE EVENING AND HIS WHOLE SYSTEM IN CONSEQUENCE IN A STATE SO SERENE SWEET AND SATISFACTORY THAT I REALLY BELIEVE THERE WAS GENUINE MOISTURE IN HIS PINK DOVE-LIKE EYES AS HE LIFTED THEM TO THE HEAVENS AND MURMURED BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL AND HE MISTOOK HIS SENSATIONS FOR A HOLY RAPTURE AND SILENT WORSHIP
ONCE AGAIN DO YOU PROMISE YES RADIE
IT WAS ONLY TWO-AND-TWENTY YEARS AGO AND I WAS THEN BUT ELEVEN YEARS OLD
IN THIS THERE CAN BE NO DISMAY
IS IT SIR HARRY BRACTON
BUT MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH SIR JULIUS WAS A TRIFLING MATTER
NOT QUITE AWAKE YET HARDLY
REMEMBER I AM NEITHER WELL NOR HAPPY AND FORGIVE WHAT YOU CANNOT LIKE IN ME
SHE CHOSE TO BE GRACIOUS TO THE LAKES
AND IN FACT THAT UNLESS HE WITHDREW I MUST ACQUAINT THE YOUNG LADY'S GUARDIAN OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WAS QUITE ENOUGH PROBABILITY IN THIS STORY TO WARRANT JOS
HE CHOSE AN UNLUCKY MOMENT FOR HIS DEPARTURE
ONE ADVANTAGE WHICH THE GOOD ATTORNEY DERIVED FROM HIS DOUBLE ACCOUNT WITH THE RIVAL INSTITUTIONS WAS THAT WHENEVER CONVENIENT HE COULD THROW ONE OF THESE CERTIFICATES OF DESTITUTION AND IMPOTENCE SADLY UNDER THE EYES OF A CLIENT IN WANT OF MONEY LIKE POOR WILL WYLDER
SOME GRAPES PLEASE SAID LAKE TO THE YOUNG LADY BEHIND THE TABLE
STRONG POINTS EH CHARLIE
IT WAS PROTRACTED TO THE 2ND OCTOBER WHEN YOU ARRIVED IN THE DOWN TRAIN AT DOLLINGTON AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND TOOK A CAB TO THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE YOU WERE MET BY A GENTLEMAN ANSWERING THE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR BROTHER CAPTAIN LAKE
DORCAS ADDED ANOTHER BLOSSOM
AND ASSURED HIM THAT LORD EDWARD BUXLEIGH WHOM HE HAD RECOMMENDED TO STAY AT THE HOUSE FOR THE SHOOTING HAD BEEN VERY WELL PLEASED WITH THE ACCOMMODATION--VERY HIGHLY SO INDEED--AND HIS LORDSHIP HAD SO EXPRESSED HIMSELF WHEN THEY HAD LAST MET AT SIR HUGH HUXTERLEY'S OF HATCH COURT
I'D DO THE SAME FOR YOU SIR
DURING THIS TREMENDOUS PERIOD MISS WILLIAMS HARDLY RESEMBLED HERSELF--HER EYES DILATED HER LIPS WERE PALE AND HER BROW CORRUGATED WITH DEEP AND INFLEXIBLE LINES OF FEAR AND PERPLEXITY
HE WAS A GOOD DEAL BLOWN AND HEATED BY HIS RUN AND A LITTLE WILD AND SCARED AT THE CLOSENESS OF THE CAPTAIN'S UNCONSCIOUS PURSUIT
SIT DOWN FOR A MOMENT AND LISTEN DARLING
YOU ARE ALL SO GOOD AND FOND OF WILLIE THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY READY ALMOST TO QUARREL FOR HIM BUT HER LITTLE LAUGH PRODUCED NO ECHO EXCEPT A VERY JOYLESS AND FLUSHED EFFORT FROM THE ATTORNEY AS HE LOOKED UP FROM CONSULTING HIS WATCH
STANLEY LAKE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MORE THAN HE COULD WELL AFFORD THAT IT WERE THAT DAY WEEK AND HE NO WORSE OFF
IF HE WANTS TO BORROW ANY I'LL SURPRISE HIM THE CUR
I THINK YOU ARE BETTER HE SAID LOOKING IN HER FACE AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
IT SHALL NOT BE ALL BITTER NOR ALL SWEET FOR ANY
AND IN AN ADVANCED STAGE OF DECOMPOSITION THAT SETTLES THE MATTER SAID LARKIN BREATHING AGAIN AND WITH A TOSS OF HIS HEAD AND ALMOST A SMILE OF DISDAIN
THE CAPTAIN ACCOMPANIED BY MR JEKYL MYSELF AND A COUPLE OF THE GRAVE SCRIVENERS FROM THE NEXT ROOM WERE TO GO BY THE BACK APPROACH AND REDMAN'S DELL TO THE ASSEMBLY ROOMS WHICH CRUMP AND THOMAS ALREADY ON THEIR WAY IN THE FLY UNDERTOOK TO HAVE OPEN FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND FURNISHED WITH SOME SERIOUS POLITICIANS FROM THE VICINITY
MEN ARE TOO HASTY TO JUDGE ONE ANOTHER MY DEAR SIR
THIS IS SELF-SACRIFICING AND NOBLE AND JUST THE CONSCIENTIOUS CONDUCT I SHOULD EXPECT FROM MYSELF BUT THERE WAS ALSO THIS CONSIDERATION WHICH YOU FAILED TO DEFINE
AND THIS MYSTERY OF MARK WYLDER'S FLIGHT AND SECLUSION WAS THE PRESENT OBJECT OF HIS KEEN AND PATIENT PURSUIT
BUT I DID NOT SAY I WANTED ANYTHING OF COURSE YOU DO OR I SHOULD NOT HAVE SEEN YOU
THIS IS VERY ODD INDEED LARKIN'S FINGER-TIPS DESCENDED OVER HIS EYEBROW AND SCRATCHED IN A MINIATURE WAY THERE FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN HIS LARGE LONG HAND DESCENDED FURTHER TO HIS CHIN AND HIS UNDER-LIP WAS AS USUAL IN DEEP THOUGHT FONDLED AND PINCHED BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB
I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE
I LOOK UPON IT SIR THAT THAT PARTY HAS BEEN MADE AWAY WITH OLD VILLAIN EXCLAIMED LAKE STARTING UP WITH A SUDDEN ACCESS OF ENERGY AND HIS FACE LOOKED WHITER STILL THAN USUAL--PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY THE LIGHT
HE THOUGHT UNEASILY WHETHER THERE MIGHT NOT BE A SIDE-PATH OR ORIFICE ANYWHERE THROUGH WHICH HE MIGHT CREEP SO AS TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE AND LISTEN
MY FATE MAY BE QUITE A DIFFERENT ONE FROM THAT WHICH I SUPPOSE OR YOU IMAGINE
WELL WHAT IS HE DOING AND WHEN DOES HE COME BACK
CAPTAIN LAKE KNEW SOMETHING OF FEMININE PAROXYSMS
THREE DIFFERENT PERSONS--UNEXCEPTIONABLE WITNESSES--CAN DEPOSE TO HAVING SEEN HIM LAST NIGHT AND HE HAD A LONG CONFERENCE WITH CAPTAIN LAKE WHO IS BY THIS TIME MAKING HIS DEPOSITION
YOU'RE NEAR FORTY EH NUNKIE
THE HONEST GYLINGDEN FOLK SELDOM HEARD THE TOWER CHIMES TELL ELEVEN AND GENTLE AND SIMPLE HAD OF COURSE BEEN LONG IN THEIR BEDS
BUT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AFTER THE MANNER OF MEN WERE SPITED WITH FORTUNE
YOU LITTLE THINK I HAVE YOU HERE
BUT STANLEY HOPED TO PUMP THE ATTORNEY AND THE ATTORNEY I'M AFRAID LIKED BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASHIONABLE CAPTAIN
TO BE SURE
AND HAVING TAKEN THIS PLAN OF CONCEALING HIS RESIDENCE WILL CONDUCT IT SKILFULLY
IT WAS A PLEASANT DRIVE UNDER THE NOBLE OLD TREES
THERE ARE MUCH HANDSOMER MEN THAN HE AND MANY AS AMUSING--AND HE WITH NO ESTATE SHE HAD HEARD OF CHARMS AND PHILTRES
THE WORTHY ATTORNEY HAD MUCH MORE OF THAT LEAVEN THAN HE
SIR FRANCIS SEDDLEY CAME DOWN EXPRESS FROM LONDON AND ASSISTED BY OUR SKILFUL COUNTY PRACTITIONER HUMPHREY BUDDLE ESQ M.D
I KNOW--UPON MY HONOUR AND SOUL SIR--NOTHING ON EARTH ABOUT HIM--WHAT HE'S DOING WHERE HE IS OR WHAT'S BECOME OF HIM
THERE'S MORE IN THIS STANLEY THAN YOU CARE TO TELL ME
VERY ODD ECHOED THE ATTORNEY
IT WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN MARK WYLDER'S HAND--NOT THE LEAST LIKE IT
WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE INSANE I FEEL THE SPIRIT OF A PROPHETESS TOO AND I SEE THE SORROW THAT AWAITS ME
IT WAS ONE OF TOM MOORE'S MELODIES
I AM HEAVEN KNOWS GIVING TO THIS AFFAIR OF MY ABSENT CLIENT'S GRATUITOUSLY AS MUCH THOUGHT AND VIGILANCE AS EVER I DID TO ANY CASE IN WHICH I WAS DULY REMUNERATED
AND IF YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOUR THAT YOU QUITE ABANDON THAT IDEA I SHALL ON THE INSTANT TAKE MY LEAVE AND CERTAINLY FOR THE PRESENT TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER UPON A MOST PAINFUL SUBJECT AND NOW SIR AS I HAVE NO INTENTION WHATEVER OF TOLERATING YOUR INCOMPREHENSIBLY IMPERTINENT INTERFERENCE AND DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR MEANING IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE AND DO NOT INTEND TO WITHDRAW THE OFFER I HAVE MADE TO GOOD MRS WYLDER YOU WILL I HOPE PERCEIVE THE USELESSNESS OF PROLONGING YOUR VISIT AND BE SO GOOD AS TO LEAVE ME IN UNMOLESTED POSSESSION OF MY POOR RESIDENCE IF I WISHED TO DO YOU AN INJURY MISS LAKE I SHOULD TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD
JUMP OFF SHOUTED WEALDON
HE KNOWS WHEN INFLAMMATION MAY BE EXPECTED AND FEVER WILL SUPERVENE
AND THE FACT IS MY DEAR SIR WE MUST LOOK THE THING STRAIGHT IN THE FACE
I HAVE IT HERE NOTED AND PREPARED
