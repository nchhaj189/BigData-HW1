HUCK EXPLAINS.LAYING OUT A CAMPAIGN.WORKING THE CAMPMEETING.A PIRATE AT THE CAMPMEETING.THE DUKE AS A PRINTER
LOOK AT OLD NORTHUMBERLAND
HOW DO YOU COME TO BE HERE JIM AND HOW'D YOU GET HERE HE LOOKED PRETTY UNEASY AND DIDN'T SAY NOTHING FOR A MINUTE
THEN THE YOUNG MAN HOVE A SIGH AND SAYS
WHAT YOU WANT IS PRACTICE
AND WHILE THEY WAS FULL OF IT NEXT DAY BACK COMES OLD FINN AND WENT BOO-HOOING TO JUDGE THATCHER TO GET MONEY TO HUNT FOR THE NIGGER ALL OVER ILLINOIS WITH
 HE DROPPED BELOW ME WITH THE CURRENT AND BY AND BY HE CAME A-SWINGING UP SHORE IN THE EASY WATER AND HE WENT BY SO CLOSE I COULD A REACHED OUT THE GUN AND TOUCHED HIM
IT WAS ONE OF THESE LONG SLANTING TWO-MILE CROSSINGS
THE DUKE WAS THINKING HE'D BEEN DOING PRETTY WELL TILL THE KING COME TO SHOW UP BUT AFTER THAT HE DIDN'T THINK SO SO MUCH
 HE GOT EVERY BLESSED ONE OF THEM OUT OF THAT YOUNG FLATHEAD THAT WE CANOED UP TO THE STEAMBOAT
BUT PAINSTAKINGLY AND WITH THE TRUSTWORTHY GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT OF PERSONAL FAMILIARITY WITH THESE SEVERAL FORMS OF SPEECH
AND BY AND BY ABOUT MIDNIGHT THEY MADE JIM AND ME BACK HER OUT AND FLOAT HER DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER AND FETCH HER IN AND HIDE HER ABOUT TWO MILE BELOW TOWN
 BUT THIS ONE WAS A STAVING DREAM
BUT I BET WE CAN FIND A WAY THAT'S TWICE AS LONG
 I FELT SO LONESOME I MOST WISHED I WAS DEAD
WHEN JIM CALLED ME TO TAKE THE WATCH AT FOUR IN THE MORNING HE SAYS
AND SO WHEN I COULDN'T STAND IT NO LONGER I LIT OUT
SOLOMON HAD ONE
BUT HE NEVER TOLD WHAT IT WAS HE SAID TO IT
SHE WAS TWENTY-FIVE AND TALL AND PROUD AND GRAND BUT AS GOOD AS SHE COULD BE WHEN SHE WARN'T STIRRED UP
 I'VE AS GOOD A NOTION AS EVER I HAD IN MY LIFE TO TAKE IT OUT O YOU THIS VERY MINUTE
 ALL THE NOBILITY DOES THAT WAS JUST HIS WAY
THE RUNAWAY NIGGER
 MY SERVANT HERE K'N TELL YOU BOUT IT GENTLEMEN THE DOCTOR AND SEVERAL SAID SHUCKS AND I SEE NOBODY DIDN'T ALTOGETHER BELIEVE HIM
SO EVERY NOW AND THEN I'D BORROW TWO OR THREE DOLLARS OFF OF THE JUDGE FOR HIM TO KEEP FROM GETTING A COWHIDING
AND SO HE WENT ON A-BRAGGING ABOUT THE TRAGEDY AND ABOUT EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER WHICH WAS TO PLAY THE MAIN PRINCIPAL PART IN IT
BEWARE
 ON THAT SIDE IT WAS A GOOD MANY MILES WIDE BUT ON THE MISSOURI SIDE IT WAS THE SAME OLD DISTANCE ACROSSA HALF A MILEBECAUSE THE MISSOURI SHORE WAS JUST A WALL OF HIGH BLUFFS
 THE GIRLS WOULDN'T SAY NOTHING BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO GO TO ENGLAND
 WHAT A BODY WAS HEARING AMONGST THEM ALL THE TIME WAS
THERE MAY BE BULLIER CIRCUSES THAN WHAT THAT ONE WAS BUT I NEVER STRUCK THEM YET
AND YOUR PAP HAIN'T EVER BEEN BACK SINCE
AND TO MAKE IT MORE SCARY THE SKY WAS DARKING UP AND THE LIGHTNING BEGINNING TO WINK AND FLITTER AND THE WIND TO SHIVER AMONGST THE LEAVES
I'M A-STANDING ABOUT ALL I CAN STAND NOWSO DON'T GIMME NO SASS
SHE PUT ME IN THEM NEW CLOTHES AGAIN AND I COULDN'T DO NOTHING BUT SWEAT AND SWEAT AND FEEL ALL CRAMPED UP
 THERE WAS PAP LOOKING WILD AND SKIPPING AROUND EVERY WHICH WAY AND YELLING ABOUT SNAKES
 BOGGS RODE OFF BLACKGUARDING SHERBURN AS LOUD AS HE COULD YELL ALL DOWN THE STREET
FOR JULIET'S A DEAR SWEET MERE CHILD OF A GIRL YOU KNOW AND SHE DOESN'T BRAY LIKE A JACKASS WELL NEXT THEY GOT OUT A COUPLE OF LONG SWORDS THAT THE DUKE MADE OUT OF OAK LATHS AND BEGUN TO PRACTICE THE SWORD FIGHTTHE DUKE CALLED HIMSELF RICHARD III
 I COULDN'T GET HIM TO LET ME STAY AND WAIT FOR SID
I JUST GIVE UP THEN
 DE RIVER WUZ A-RISIN EN DEY WUZ A GOOD CURRENT
I GOT TO TURN OUT AND FIND MY NIGGER HE LOOKED KINDER BOTHERED AND STOOD THERE WITH HIS BILLS FLUTTERING ON HIS ARM THINKING AND WRINKLING UP HIS FOREHEAD
AND THEN A PERFECT RIPPER OF A GUST WOULD FOLLOW ALONG AND SET THE BRANCHES TO TOSSING THEIR ARMS AS IF THEY WAS JUST WILD
 WE SHUT THE CELLAR DOOR BEHIND US AND WHEN THEY FOUND THE BAG THEY SPILT IT OUT ON THE FLOOR AND IT WAS A LOVELY SIGHT ALL THEM YALLER-BOYS
 "PICKS IS THE THING MORAL OR NO MORAL
 I STOOD BY THE DUKE AT THE DOOR AND I SEE THAT EVERY MAN THAT WENT IN HAD HIS POCKETS BULGING OR SOMETHING MUFFLED UP UNDER HIS COATAND I SEE IT WARN'T NO PERFUMERY NEITHER NOT BY A LONG SIGHT
 SHE RUN OFF IN DE NIGHT SOME TIMENOBODY DON'T KNOW JIS WHEN
 I MADE THE LAND ABOUT A MILE BELOW AND BEEN FOOLING ALONG EVER SINCE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING BUT THEY SAID WHAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AND SUCH A CURRENT
 DON'T ANSWER ME THAT WAY
 BUT WE GOT TO LET THAT GO
I SAYS TO MYSELF THIS IS ANOTHER ONE THAT I'M LETTING HIM ROB HER OF HER MONEY
 NO DIFFERENCEJUST THE SAME THING
 NOW LOOK AT JUST THAT ONE THING OF THE LANTERN
IT GOT TO TROUBLING ME SO I COULDN'T REST
HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE OF HAVING ME OUT OF THE WAY THE WHOLE THREE DAYS
AND THE KING AND THE DUKE WOULD RUTHER MARY JANE WAS OFF WORKING FOR THE AUCTION THAN AROUND IN REACH OF DOCTOR ROBINSON
 YOU BEEN A-DRINKING DRINKIN
 I DONE IT AND HE EAT IT AND SAID IT WOULD HELP CURE HIM
 BLESS YOU CHILD WHEN YOU SET OUT TO THREAD A NEEDLE DON'T HOLD THE THREAD STILL AND FETCH THE NEEDLE UP TO IT
BUT AS I WAS SAYING SHE DIED BEFORE SHE GOT HER MIND MADE UP AND NOW THEY KEPT THIS PICTURE OVER THE HEAD OF THE BED IN HER ROOM AND EVERY TIME HER BIRTHDAY COME THEY HUNG FLOWERS ON IT
THEY FOUND OUT HE HADN'T BEN SEEN SENCE TEN O'CLOCK THE NIGHT THE MURDER WAS DONE
BUT SOMETIMES NOT THAT WAY BECAUSE THEY'VE LEFT DEAD FISH LAYING AROUND GARS AND SUCH AND THEY DO GET PRETTY RANK
 SO JIM HE WAS SORRY AND SAID HE WOULDN'T BEHAVE SO NO MORE AND THEN ME AND TOM SHOVED FOR BED
 OH HE DONE IT ADMIRABLE
 NOW I THOUGHT OF SOMETHING ELSE
AND HE'D LAND ON THAT WRECK IF IT WAS HIS LAST ACT
I HAD HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS BEFORE BUT NOT ALL OF THEM
 IN THE DAY AND IN THE NIGHT-TIME SOMETIMES MOONLIGHT SOMETIMES STORMS AND WE A-FLOATING ALONG TALKING AND SINGING AND LAUGHING
 I SLIPPED THE RAMROD DOWN IT TO MAKE SURE IT WAS LOADED THEN I LAID IT ACROSS THE TURNIP BARREL POINTING TOWARDS PAP AND SET DOWN BEHIND IT TO WAIT FOR HIM TO STIR
 HE TOLD ME WHEN THE ROADS FORKED I MUST TAKE THE RIGHT HAND AND FIVE MILE WOULD FETCH ME TO GOSHEN HE WAS DRUNK I RECKON
LEASTWAYS I KINDER FORGET
AND THE OLD DOCTOR AND UNCLE SILAS FOLLOWED AFTER TOM INTO THE HOUSE
 DEN I GIN M TEN CENTS APIECE EN DEY UZ MIGHTY WELL SATISFIED EN WISHT SOME MO RAF'S UD COME ALONG EN MAKE M RICH AGIN
 ALL THE BOYS DID
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO RUN THE RAFT IN THE DAYTIME WITHOUT ANYBODY ABOARD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT ME
 YOU CAN GET UP THE INFANT-SCHOOLIEST WAYS OF GOING AT A THING
 WE NEITHER OF US COULD KEEP STILL
 THEN THE FIRST DARK NIGHT THAT COMES STEAL THE KEY OUT OF THE OLD MAN'S BRITCHES AFTER HE GOES TO BED AND SHOVE OFF DOWN THE RIVER ON THE RAFT WITH JIM HIDING DAYTIMES AND RUNNING NIGHTS THE WAY ME AND JIM USED TO DO BEFORE
WE GOT TO RUSH
DIDN'T YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR MIND TO HOOK THE MONEY AND HIDE IT THE DUKE NEVER SAID NOTHING FOR A LITTLE BIT
 THEN WE SET OUT THE LINES
 AS I SPRUNG ABOARD I SUNG OUT
GOODNESS SAKES
THEY BURIED HIM AND WE COME BACK HOME AND I WENT TO WATCHING FACES AGAINI COULDN'T HELP IT AND I COULDN'T REST EASY
 JIM DIDN'T LIKE THE SPIDERS AND THE SPIDERS DIDN'T LIKE JIM
 SO THE VERY NEXT MORNING AT THE STREAK OF DAWN WE GOT ANOTHER LETTER READY AND WAS WONDERING WHAT WE BETTER DO WITH IT BECAUSE WE HEARD THEM SAY AT SUPPER THEY WAS GOING TO HAVE A NIGGER ON WATCH AT BOTH DOORS ALL NIGHT
 WELL I KNOWED A POTATO WOULD DO THAT BEFORE BUT I HAD FORGOT IT
KIN ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN TELL ME WHER MR PETER WILKS LIVES THEY GIVE A GLANCE AT ONE ANOTHER AND NODDED THEIR HEADS AS MUCH AS TO SAY WHAT D I TELL YOU  THEN ONE OF THEM SAYS KIND OF SOFT AND GENTLE
 AT LAST I GOT SO SLEEPY I COULDN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN ALL I COULD DO AND SO BEFORE I KNOWED WHAT I WAS ABOUT I WAS SOUND ASLEEP AND THE CANDLE BURNING
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE DOCTOR UPS AND TURNS ON THEM
THEY'LL SOON GET TIRED OF THAT AND WON'T BOTHER NO MORE ABOUT ME
BUT WE'VE ALL GOT TO GO ONE TIME OR ANOTHER
 I RECKON THAT'S A CONSIDERBLE SIGHT BETTER N KILLIN OF HIM
 I WANT IT I HAIN'T GOT ONLY A DOLLAR AND I WANT THAT TO IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE WHAT YOU WANT IT FORYOU JUST SHELL IT OUT HE TOOK IT AND BIT IT TO SEE IF IT WAS GOOD AND THEN HE SAID HE WAS GOING DOWN TOWN TO GET SOME WHISKY
 WHO EVER HEARD OF GETTING A PRISONER LOOSE IN SUCH AN OLD-MAIDY WAY AS THAT
AND WHEN SHE COME SHE WAS HOT AND RED AND CROSS AND COULDN'T HARDLY WAIT FOR THE BLESSING
 HE WAS AS KIND AS HE COULD BEYOU COULD FEEL THAT YOU KNOW AND SO YOU HAD CONFIDENCE
PAP WARN'T IN A GOOD HUMORSO HE WAS HIS NATURAL SELF
AND HE SINGS OUT
 THE SECRET OF MY BIRTH THE SECRET OF YOUR BIRTH
 WELL MISS MARY JANE SHE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU SHE'S GONE OVER THERE IN A DREADFUL HURRYONE OF THEM'S SICK WHICH ONE I DON'T KNOW
BUT IT'S TOLABLE DARK IN HEAH EN I AIN GOT NO USE F'R NO FLOWER NOHOW EN SHE'D BE A POW'FUL SIGHT O TROUBLE WELL YOU TRY IT ANYWAY
 I SAID I DIDN'T KNOW
 I CHANGED TO THE ILLINOIS EDGE OF THE ISLAND TO SEE WHAT LUCK I COULD HAVE AND I WARN'T DISAPPOINTED
 BUT WHEN HE DID GET THE THING STRAIGHTENED AROUND HE LOOKED AT ME STEADY WITHOUT EVER SMILING AND SAYS
 THE DOOR WAS OPEN INTO THE PARLOR WHERE THE CORPSE WAS LAYING AND THERE WAS A CANDLE IN BOTH ROOMS
 BUT I BETTER HIVE IT TONIGHT IF I CAN BECAUSE THE DOCTOR MAYBE HASN'T LET UP AS MUCH AS HE LETS ON HE HAS
 MUM'S THE WORD FOR US AS THEY WAS STARTING DOWN THE LADDER THE DUKE HE CHUCKLES AGAIN AND SAYS
 WE WAS DOWN SOUTH IN THE WARM WEATHER NOW AND A MIGHTY LONG WAYS FROM HOME
 AND DON'T GO ABOUT WOMEN IN THAT OLD CALICO
DERN HIM I WONDER WHAT HE DONE WITH THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS THEY WORRIED OVER THAT AWHILE AND RANSACKED ALL AROUND FOR IT
 NIGGERS WOULD COME FROM ALL AROUND THERE AND GIVE JIM ANYTHING THEY HAD JUST FOR A SIGHT OF THAT FIVE-CENTER PIECE
IT WOULD MAKE MARY JANE COMFORTABLE AND IT WOULDN'T COST NOTHING
BUT I DON'T KNOWMAYBE YOU WAS ASLEEP AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU WAS ABOUT THE DUKE BRISTLES UP NOW AND SAYS
 SAY BOY WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR FATHER IT'S THEATHEWELL IT AIN'T ANYTHING MUCH THEY STOPPED PULLING
 LOOK AT BOTH PLEASETHEY'RE BY THE SAME HAND THE LAWYER DONE IT AND SAYS
 WHY CAN'T YOU STICK TO THE MAIN POINT ALL RIGHTI DON'T CARE WHERE HE COMES OUT SO HE COMES OUT
 THE WOODS WARN'T THICK SO I LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER TO DODGE THE BULLET AND TWICE I SEEN HARNEY COVER BUCK WITH HIS GUN
 DIDN'T YOU TOTE OUT DE LINE IN DE CANOE FER TO MAKE FAS TO DE TOW-HEAD NO I DIDN'T
AND THE HORSE A-GOING LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE TOO
AND SO THREE TIMES THEY COME OUT RIGHT AND THREE TIMES THEY COME OUT WRONG
 I BET I'LL TAKE SOME O THESE FRILLS OUT O YOU BEFORE I'M DONE WITH YOU
WHY DUKE IT WAS YOU THAT SAID MAKE UP THE DEFFISIT
 BUT THE LAWYER HE JUMPS ON THE TABLE AND YELLS AND SAYS
 WHEN THE WOMAN STOPPED TALKING I LOOKED UP AND SHE WAS LOOKING AT ME PRETTY CURIOUS AND SMILING A LITTLE
 I SEE THE HANDBILL MYSELF
 THE WINDOWS AND DOORYARDS WAS FULL
 IT WAS AFTER SUN-UP AND I HAD BEEN SOUND ASLEEP
 WHEN I STRUCK SUSAN AND THE HARE-LIP I SAYS
 SHE WAS LEANING OVER WITH PART OF HER UPPER DECK ABOVE WATER AND YOU COULD SEE EVERY LITTLE CHIMBLY-GUY CLEAN AND CLEAR AND A CHAIR BY THE BIG BELL WITH AN OLD SLOUCH HAT HANGING ON THE BACK OF IT WHEN THE FLASHES COME
THEY'RE COMING AFTER ME
 THAT IS NOTHING
BUT WHEN SHE GOT DONE THERE WARN'T HARDLY ANYTHING LEFT O POOR HARE-LIP
WHY MY BOY YOU ARE ALL OUT OF BREATH
 _HE KNOW HOW TO VALUE EM
 SHE WAS A TWO-STORY AND TILTED OVER CONSIDERABLE
AND TOLD HIS DRIVER TO WAIT AND WE DROVE OFF A LITTLE PIECE AND I TOLD HIM THE KIND OF A FIX I WAS IN AND WHAT DID HE RECKON WE BETTER DO
 JIM THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA SO WE TOOK A SMOKE ON IT AND WAITED
 WHAT I WANT IS MY NIGGER
 THEN WE LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOW
 IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE THING TO DO AND NO TROUBLE
 DOES THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS LAY AROUND EVERY DAY FOR PEOPLE TO PICK UP
 PRETTY SOON WE COME TO A NICE INNOCENT-LOOKING YOUNG COUNTRY JAKE SETTING ON A LOG SWABBING THE SWEAT OFF OF HIS FACE FOR IT WAS POWERFUL WARM WEATHER
 SHE DIDN'T EVER HAVE TO STOP TO THINK
 I PUT DOWN THE NEEDLE AND THREAD AND LET ON TO BE INTERESTEDAND I WAS TOOAND SAYS
THE DOCTOR WAS AN OLD MAN
 AND WOULDN'T HE THROW STYLE INTO IT?WOULDN'T HE SPREAD HIMSELF NOR NOTHING
 THERE WAS THINGS WHICH HE STRETCHED BUT MAINLY HE TOLD THE TRUTH
 (I RECKONED I WOULDN'T SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE DOLLAR I GOT FROM THE JUDGE I SAID IT WAS PRETTY BAD MONEY BUT MAYBE THE HAIR-BALL WOULD TAKE IT BECAUSE MAYBE IT WOULDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
TAKE A-HOLD OF IT
 DO YOU WANT TO GO TO DOING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S IN THE BOOKS AND GET THINGS ALL MUDDLED UP OH THAT'S ALL VERY FINE TO SAY TOM SAWYER BUT HOW IN THE NATION ARE THESE FELLOWS GOING TO BE RANSOMED IF WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT TO THEM?THAT'S THE THING I WANT TO GET AT
AND WHEN THINGS BEGAN TO COME BACK TO ME THEY SEEMED TO COME UP DIM OUT OF LAST WEEK
 AND WHEN THEY GOT TO THE GRAVE THEY FOUND THEY HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES AS MANY SHOVELS AS THEY WANTED BUT NOBODY HADN'T THOUGHT TO FETCH A LANTERN
TAKE Y'R HANDS OFF!LEGGO MY THROAT!I TAKE IT ALL BACK THE DUKE SAYS
 ONE WAS PILGRIM'S PROGRESS ABOUT A MAN THAT LEFT HIS FAMILY IT DIDN'T SAY WHY
 EVERY TIME HE DANCED AROUND AND SAYS DAH'S CAIRO IT WENT THROUGH ME LIKE A SHOT AND I THOUGHT IF IT WAS CAIRO I RECKONED I WOULD DIE OF MISERABLENESS
 I SAYS TO MYSELF SPOS'N HE CAN'T FIX THAT LEG JUST IN THREE SHAKES OF A SHEEP'S TAIL AS THE SAYING IS
 I LOOKED AWAY DOWN-STREAM AND SEEN A BLACK SPECK ON THE WATER
 AND THEN HE HAD FETCHED AWAY A THREE-GALLON JUG OF WHISKY TOO THAT HE FOUND UNDER A WAGON WHEN HE WAS STARTING HOME THROUGH THE WOODS
 MISS WATSON'S BIG NIGGER NAMED JIM WAS SETTING IN THE KITCHEN DOOR
 SO I SET DOWN AND LAID FOR HIM TO WAKE
 SAYS I I BROKE IN AND SAYS
 I WATCHED THEIR FACES TO SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN HAPPENING BUT I COULDN'T TELL
 SO WE WENT A-QUAKING AND SHAKING DOWN THE STABBOARD SIDE AND SLOW WORK IT WAS TOOSEEMED A WEEK BEFORE WE GOT TO THE STERN
 I JUMPED IN AND WAS OFF IN A HURRY
 YOU LEMME CATCH YOU FOOLING AROUND THAT SCHOOL AGAIN YOU HEAR
TROT AHEAD I FOLLOWED A HALF A MILE
 I DIDN'T DO HIM NO MORE MEAN TRICKS AND I WOULDN'T DONE THAT ONE IF I'D A KNOWED IT WOULD MAKE HIM FEEL THAT WAY
HELLO JIM HAVE I BEEN ASLEEP
 HAS I BEN A-DRINKIN
 THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE GOOD DEAL OF TALK ALL THE AFTERNOON AND ME AND TOM WAS ON THE LOOKOUT ALL THE TIME
OH LET UP ON THIS CUSSED NONSENSE
 YOU DO THAT WHEN YOU'VE LOST A HORSESHOE THAT YOU'VE FOUND INSTEAD OF NAILING IT UP OVER THE DOOR BUT I HADN'T EVER HEARD ANYBODY SAY IT WAS ANY WAY TO KEEP OFF BAD LUCK WHEN YOU'D KILLED A SPIDER
THEN THE OTHER BROTHERS ON BOTH SIDES GOES FOR ONE ANOTHER
WE'S SAFE HUCK WE'S SAFE
 IF HE TELLS THEM TO BUILD A PALACE FORTY MILES LONG OUT OF DI'MONDS AND FILL IT FULL OF CHEWING-GUM OR WHATEVER YOU WANT AND FETCH AN EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER FROM CHINA FOR YOU TO MARRY THEY'VE GOT TO DO ITAND THEY'VE GOT TO DO IT BEFORE SUN-UP NEXT MORNING TOO
THE KING WENT FOR HIM.A ROYAL ROW.POWERFUL MELLOW
 DE DREAM SAY LET BALUM INVES DE TEN CENTS EN HE'D MAKE A RAISE FOR ME
NOUGH!I OWN UP I WAS VERY GLAD TO HEAR HIM SAY THAT
BUT HE DON'T MIND IT CUZ HE DON'T WEIGH MUCH ANYWAY
 I DIDN'T BELIEVE WE COULD LICK SUCH A CROWD OF SPANIARDS AND A-RABS BUT I WANTED TO SEE THE CAMELS AND ELEPHANTS SO I WAS ON HAND NEXT DAY SATURDAY IN THE AMBUSCADE
 AND YET YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF NATURAL TO HIDE UNDER THE BED WHEN YOU ARE UP TO ANYTHING PRIVATE
 SOMETIMES HE SMILED AND IT WAS GOOD TO SEE
WE HEARD THEM SING OUT
 'LONG BOUT SIX IN DE MAWNIN SKIFTS BEGIN TO GO BY EN BOUT EIGHT ER NINE EVERY SKIFT DAT WENT LONG WUZ TALKIN BOUT HOW YO PAP COME OVER TO DE TOWN EN SAY YOU'S KILLED
 I RECKON I HAIN'T RAISED SUCH A SCAMP AS MY TOM ALL THESE YEARS NOT TO KNOW HIM WHEN I SEE HIM
 HE WON'T LAST YES HE WILL LAST TOO
 I WUZ DE ON'Y ONE DAT HAD MUCH
SO BEING TIRED WE BID GOOD-NIGHT AND WENT UP TO BED RIGHT AFTER SUPPER AND CLUMB OUT OF THE WINDOW AND DOWN THE LIGHTNING-ROD AND SHOVED FOR THE TOWN
IS IT MY POOR BROTHER'S DEAR GOOD FRIEND AND PHYSICIAN
BUT THEY AIN'T NOTHING TO THAT OLD RAM ANYWAY
QUICK SALES AND SMALL PROFITS
HE'S BITING ME ON THE NECK  I NEVER SEE A MAN LOOK SO WILD IN THE EYES
 BY AND BY SOMEBODY SINGS OUT
SO I SHOVED FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER ON A LONG DOWN-STREAM SLANT
 A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT DON'T COST NOTHING AND IT'S JUST THE LITTLE THINGS THAT MAKES A MAN TO BE LOOKED UP TO AND LIKED
 BUT I DASN'T GO FUR OR SHE'D A SENT FOR ME
 CHILDREN WAS HEELING IT AHEAD OF THE MOB SCREAMING AND TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
 THE KING TOLD US TO STAND WELL OUT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER AND NOT SHOW A LIGHT TILL WE GOT A LONG WAYS BELOW THE TOWN
 WELL THE IRON-JAWED MAN HE LAUGHED RIGHT IN HIS FACE
BUT SHE JUMPED UP AND WIPED IT OFF WITH THE BACK OF HER HAND AND SAYS
 BUT I DIDN'T
THERE'S THE RESPECT MUST GIVE US PAUSE
 I FETCHED THE SHORE A HALF A MILE ABOVE THE VILLAGE AND THEN WENT SCOOTING ALONG THE BLUFF BANK IN THE EASY WATER
BUT PAP DROVE HIM OFF WITH THE GUN AND IT WARN'T LONG AFTER THAT TILL I WAS USED TO BEING WHERE I WAS AND LIKED ITALL BUT THE COWHIDE PART
 A COUPLE OF NIGGER TRADERS COME ALONG AND THE KING SOLD THEM THE NIGGERS REASONABLE FOR THREE-DAY DRAFTS AS THEY CALLED IT AND AWAY THEY WENT THE TWO SONS UP THE RIVER TO MEMPHIS AND THEIR MOTHER DOWN THE RIVER TO ORLEANS
 KILL THE WOMEN
AND FOLKS AT HOME THAT HAD CHARACTERS
WE PUT ALL THE OTHER THINGS HANDY AT THE BACK OF THE CAVERN
YES IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
I WAS GETTING AFRAID I HAD COME
 THEY SQUEAKED THROUGH UNDERNEATH
 WHENEVER WE SEE ANYBODY COMING WE CAN TIE JIM HAND AND FOOT WITH A ROPE AND LAY HIM IN THE WIGWAM AND SHOW THIS HANDBILL AND SAY WE CAPTURED HIM UP THE RIVER AND WERE TOO POOR TO TRAVEL ON A STEAMBOAT SO WE GOT THIS LITTLE RAFT ON CREDIT FROM OUR FRIENDS AND ARE GOING DOWN TO GET THE REWARD
DAH'S WHAH DEY IS
AND THEN THE TEACHER CHARGED IN AND MADE US DROP EVERYTHING AND CUT
I DON'T WANT TO BLOW ON NOBODY
SHE WARN'T NEAR OVER IT
 WHO'S JIM'S MOTHER I'M HIS MOTHER
BECAUSE PETER SAID THEN THAT HE SORTER FELT LIKE HE WARN'T GOING TO GET WELL THIS TIME
 JUDGE THATCHER'S GOT IT
 I DROPPED PAP'S WHETSTONE THERE TOO SO AS TO LOOK LIKE IT HAD BEEN DONE BY ACCIDENT
BUT HE NEVER MEDDLED AT ALL
 I WAS JUST TO THAT PASS I DIDN'T HAVE NO REASONING FACULTIES NO MORE
THOUGH SAD HEARTS ROUND HIM THICKENED    'TWAS NOT FROM SICKNESS SHOTS
YOUR HEAD GETS LEVELER AND LEVELER ALL THE TIME TOM SAWYER I SAYS
 JIM SAID IT MADE HIM ALL OVER TREMBLY AND FEVERISH TO BE SO CLOSE TO FREEDOM
CHAPTER XII

IF YOU DON'T HITCH ON TO ONE TOOTH YOU'RE BOUND TO ON ANOTHER AIN'T YOU
 THE WIDOW SHE FOUND OUT WHERE I WAS BY AND BY AND SHE SENT A MAN OVER TO TRY TO GET HOLD OF ME
 SO I WENT TO HIM THAT NIGHT AND TOLD HIM PAP WAS HERE AGAIN FOR I FOUND HIS TRACKS IN THE SNOW
 WELL NOBODY COULD THINK OF ANYTHING TO DOEVERYBODY WAS STUMPED AND SET STILL
I'VE GOT IT
 AND WHEN SHE GOT THROUGH THEY ALL JEST LAID THEIRSELVES OUT TO MAKE ME FEEL AT HOME AND KNOW I WAS AMONGST FRIENDS
 WAS IT A GRANGERFORD OR A SHEPHERDSON LAWS HOW DO I KNOW
AND WHEN I RECKONED HE WAS GONE HE COME BACK AND PUT HIS HEAD IN AGAIN AND TOLD ME TO MIND ABOUT THAT SCHOOL BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO LAY FOR ME AND LICK ME IF I DIDN'T DROP THAT
GIMME THE RAGS
HE WAS STANDING PERFECTLY STILL IN THE STREET AND HAD A PISTOL RAISED IN HIS RIGHT HANDNOT AIMING IT BUT HOLDING IT OUT WITH THE BARREL TILTED UP TOWARDS THE SKY
STAND AWAY AND THE CANNON LET OFF SUCH A BLAST RIGHT BEFORE ME THAT IT MADE ME DEEF WITH THE NOISE AND PRETTY NEAR BLIND WITH THE SMOKE AND I JUDGED I WAS GONE
 I HAD STOPPED CUSSING BECAUSE THE WIDOW DIDN'T LIKE IT
CHAPTER XLII
CHAPTER XLII
 BUT WE DIDN'T WAIT
BUT THE FRONT DOOR WAS LOCKED AND THE KEY WASN'T THERE
 EVERY MINUTE IT WAS GETTING EARLIER NOW AND PRETTY SOON SOME OF THEM WATCHERS WOULD BEGIN TO STIR AND I MIGHT GET CATCHEDCATCHED WITH SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MY HANDS THAT NOBODY HADN'T HIRED ME TO TAKE CARE OF
WHO IS YOUR FOLKS HE SAYS
 TILL ONE O'CLOCK MINDNO LONGER
 THE KING AND THE DUKE TURNED OUT BY AND BY LOOKING PRETTY RUSTY
 HE'S THE BEST NATUREDEST OLD FOOL IN ARKANSAWNEVER HURT NOBODY DRUNK NOR SOBER BOGGS RODE UP BEFORE THE BIGGEST STORE IN TOWN AND BENT HIS HEAD DOWN SO HE COULD SEE UNDER THE CURTAIN OF THE AWNING AND YELLS
 SO THE HAIR-BALL TALKED TO JIM AND JIM TOLD IT TO ME
DOAN YOU MEMBER DE HOUSE DAT WAS FLOAT'N DOWN DE RIVER EN DEY WUZ A MAN IN DAH KIVERED UP EN I WENT IN EN UNKIVERED HIM AND DIDN LET YOU COME IN
 WE HAD THE SKY UP THERE ALL SPECKLED WITH STARS AND WE USED TO LAY ON OUR BACKS AND LOOK UP AT THEM AND DISCUSS ABOUT WHETHER THEY WAS MADE OR ONLY JUST HAPPENED
AND NOT MEAN BUT KIND
 WELL IF EVER I STRUCK ANYTHING LIKE IT I'M A NIGGER
THE FACES DIDN'T TELL ME NOTHING
WE COULDN'T HANDLE HIM OF COURSE
 I DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING TO DO
AND HE KEPT IT UP ALL OVER TOWN WITH A TIN PAN TILL MOST MIDNIGHT
 WELL WHAT DID HE DO
AND AFTER ALL THAT SOUL-BUTTER AND HOGWASH I NEVER SEE IT FRESHEN UP THINGS SO AND SOUND SO HONEST AND BULLY
WHEN THEY GOT ABREAST THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND THEY QUIT SHOOTING AND DROPPED OVER TO THE MISSOURI SHORE AND WENT HOME TO THE TOWN
 I DON'T WISH TO BE MIXED UP IN NO SUCH BUSINESS AS THAT I SAYS TO MYSELF
 NO
 NO
 NO
 NO
 NO
 NO
 NO
I DID WISH AUNT SALLY WOULD COME AND GET DONE WITH ME AND LICK ME IF SHE WANTED TO AND LET ME GET AWAY AND TELL TOM HOW WE'D OVERDONE THIS THING AND WHAT A THUNDERING HORNET'S-NEST WE'D GOT OURSELVES INTO SO WE COULD STOP FOOLING AROUND STRAIGHT OFF AND CLEAR OUT WITH JIM BEFORE THESE RIPS GOT OUT OF PATIENCE AND COME FOR US
BUT BY AND BY IT GOT SORT OF LONESOME AND SO I WENT AND SET ON THE BANK AND LISTENED TO THE CURRENT SWASHING ALONG AND COUNTED THE STARS AND DRIFT LOGS AND RAFTS THAT COME DOWN AND THEN WENT TO BED
 I PUT TEN DOLLARS IN A COW
A STILE MADE OUT OF LOGS SAWED OFF AND UP-ENDED IN STEPS LIKE BARRELS OF A DIFFERENT LENGTH TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCE WITH AND FOR THE WOMEN TO STAND ON WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO JUMP ON TO A HORSE
 SHE SAID ALL A BODY WOULD HAVE TO DO THERE WAS TO GO AROUND ALL DAY LONG WITH A HARP AND SING FOREVER AND EVER
 I KNOWED HE WOULD BE CHANGING IT AROUND EVERY WHICH WAY AS WE WENT ALONG AND HEAVING IN NEW BULLINESSES WHEREVER HE GOT A CHANCE
MISS WATSON YOUR RUNAWAY NIGGER JIM IS DOWN HERE TWO MILE BELOW PIKESVILLE AND MR PHELPS HAS GOT HIM AND HE WILL GIVE HIM UP FOR THE REWARD IF YOU SEND
 SO FUR SO GOOD
SPIRITS WOULDN'T SAY DERN THE DERN FOG SOON AS IT WAS NIGHT OUT WE SHOVED
 THAT WAS GOOD
 WE HAD MIGHTY GOOD WEATHER AS A GENERAL THING AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENED TO US AT ALLTHAT NIGHT NOR THE NEXT NOR THE NEXT
IT WAS BECAUSE I WARN'T SQUARE
 WHICH END GETS UP FIRST THE HIND END MUM WELL THEN A HORSE THE FOR'RARD END MUM WHICH SIDE OF A TREE DOES THE MOSS GROW ON NORTH SIDE IF FIFTEEN COWS IS BROWSING ON A HILLSIDE HOW MANY OF THEM EATS WITH THEIR HEADS POINTED THE SAME DIRECTION THE WHOLE FIFTEEN MUM WELL I RECKON YOU HAVE LIVED IN THE COUNTRY

 WHO'S THERE I SAYS
WE RUN NIGHTS AND LAID UP AND HID DAYTIMES
THAT'S WHAT AN ARMY ISA MOB
 I LIKED THE OLD WAYS BEST BUT I WAS GETTING SO I LIKED THE NEW ONES TOO A LITTLE BIT
 CONSCIENCE SAYS TO ME WHAT HAD POOR MISS WATSON DONE TO YOU THAT YOU COULD SEE HER NIGGER GO OFF RIGHT UNDER YOUR EYES AND NEVER SAY ONE SINGLE WORD
 A BODY CAN'T TELL YIT WHICH ONE GWYNE TO FETCH HIM AT DE LAS  BUT YOU IS ALL RIGHT
THEY DON'T HAVE LOG WALLS IN A DUNGEON
HE'D CALL IT AN ADVENTURETHAT'S WHAT HE'D CALL IT
 LET EM FETCH ALONG THEIR SUSPICIONS NOW IF THEY WANT TOTHIS LL LAY EM OUT WHEN WE GOT UP-STAIRS EVERYBODY GETHERED AROUND THE TABLE AND THE KING HE COUNTED IT AND STACKED IT UP THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN A PILETWENTY ELEGANT LITTLE PILES
 NOBODY CAN READ MY HAND BUT MY BROTHER THERESO HE COPIES FOR ME
 THAT WAS BRIGHTIT WAS RIGHT DOWN BULLY
 MY NOSE BEGUN TO ITCH
 AND AFTER WE'D THOUGHT A MINUTE I SAYS
 YOU'LL SAY IT'S DIRTY LOW-DOWN BUSINESS
 WE STUCK TO IT ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR WHICH WAS AS LONG AS WE COULD STAND UP
 AND THE SAME WITH A KING'S SON
 HE RAISED CONSIDERABLE ROW ABOUT IT BUT ME AND JIM STUCK TO IT AND WOULDN'T BUDGE
 THE WHOOPS WAS WARNINGS THAT WOULD COME TO US EVERY NOW AND THEN AND IF WE DIDN'T TRY HARD TO MAKE OUT TO UNDERSTAND THEM THEY'D JUST TAKE US INTO BAD LUCK STEAD OF KEEPING US OUT OF IT
BUT GET THEE TO A NUNNERY&MDASH;GO
I SEE I HAD SPOKE TOO SUDDEN AND SAID TOO MUCH AND WAS IN A CLOSE PLACE
 NODROWNDED HIM IN A BUTT OF MAMSEY LIKE A CAT
WHEN I GOT UP STAIRS I LOOKED OUT AT THE WINDOW AND SEE TOM DOING HIS LEVEL BEST WITH THE LIGHTNING-ROD BUT HE COULDN'T COME IT HIS HANDS WAS SO SORE
 IF YOU THINK IT AIN'T DISMAL AND LONESOME OUT IN A FOG THAT WAY BY YOURSELF IN THE NIGHT YOU TRY IT ONCEYOU'LL SEE
 YOU SEE YOU'RE A RUNAWAY PRENTICE THAT'S ALL
BUT NOTHING WOULD DO TOM BUT HE MUST CRAWL TO WHERE JIM WAS ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND PLAY SOMETHING ON HIM
 THERE WAS TROUBLE BOUT SOMETHING AND THEN A LAWSUIT TO SETTLE IT
 A TOW-HEAD IS A SANDBAR THAT HAS COTTONWOODS ON IT AS THICK AS HARROW-TEETH
WONDERFUL ATTRACTION
 I BEGUN TO TELL ABOUT SHEFFIELD AND HOW WE LIVED THERE AND ALL ABOUT THE ENGLISH WILKSES AND SO ON
 JIM WAS MONSTROUS PROUD ABOUT IT AND HE GOT SO HE WOULDN'T HARDLY NOTICE THE OTHER NIGGERS
 I BET I KNOW WHERE JIM IS NO
BUT I SAID IN A KIND OF A COARSE WHISPER JIM AND HE ANSWERED UP RIGHT AT MY ELBOW WITH A SORT OF A MOAN AND I SAYS
AND MAYBE YOU COULD HEAR A FIDDLE OR A SONG COMING OVER FROM ONE OF THEM CRAFTS
BOY THAT'S A LIE
 I COULD HEAR THE BOOMING NOW AND THEN FURTHER AND FURTHER OFF AND BY AND BY AFTER AN HOUR I DIDN'T HEAR IT NO MORE
I THOUGHT I WAS DREAMING
 HE SAID IT WOULD FETCH BAD LUCK
CHAPTER II
CHAPTER II
 BY AND BY WHEN THEY WAS ASLEEP AND SNORING JIM SAYS
EN YOU'S DE ONLY FREN OLE JIM'S GOT NOW I WAS PADDLING OFF ALL IN A SWEAT TO TELL ON HIM
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYBODY ELSE GO IN THERE NO YOUR GRACE NOT AS I REMEMBER I BELIEVE STOP AND THINK I STUDIED AWHILE AND SEE MY CHANCE
WELL BY THE END OF THREE WEEKS EVERYTHING WAS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE
IT'S THE BEST WAY
A NIGGER STEALER.SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY.A PRETTY LONG BLESSING.TAR AND FEATHERS
CHAPTER IV
BUT WHAT TIME O DAY IN THE EVENIN''BOUT AN HOUR ER TWO BEFORE SUNDOWN HOW'D YOU COME I COME DOWN ON THE SUSAN POWELL FROM CINCINNATI WELL THEN HOW'D YOU COME TO BE UP AT THE PINT IN THE MORNIN_'IN A CANOE I WARN'T UP AT THE PINT IN THE MORNIN IT'S A LIE SEVERAL OF THEM JUMPED FOR HIM AND BEGGED HIM NOT TO TALK THAT WAY TO AN OLD MAN AND A PREACHER
SO THE DUKE GOT OUT HIS BOOK AND READ THE PARTS OVER IN THE MOST SPLENDID SPREAD-EAGLE WAY PRANCING AROUND AND ACTING AT THE SAME TIME TO SHOW HOW IT HAD GOT TO BE DONE
AND FIRST YOU KNOW THE NIGGER THAT DOES UP THE ROOMS WILL GET AN ORDER TO BOX THESE DUDS UP AND PUT EM AWAY
SO HE ALLOWED HE WOULD GO DOWN TO THE TOWN AND FIX THAT THING
 THE KING SAID IT WAS ALL THE MORE HOMELY AND MORE PLEASANTER FOR THESE FIXINGS AND SO DON'T DISTURB THEM
CHAPTER VI
CHAPTER VI
 THEY BACKED WATER
 AIN'T THAT SENSIBLE YOU BET IT IS!THE JEDGE IS RIGHT EVERYBODY SINGS OUT ALL RIGHT THENNOT A WORD ABOUT ANY SELL
 WE CAN JUST HAVE BOOMING TIMESTHEY DON'T HAVE NO SCHOOL NOW
 THAT YOUNG GIRL SCREAMED OUT AND COMES RUSHING AND DOWN SHE THROWS HERSELF ON HER FATHER CRYING AND SAYING OH HE'S KILLED HIM HE'S KILLED HIM  THE CROWD CLOSED UP AROUND THEM AND SHOULDERED AND JAMMED ONE ANOTHER WITH THEIR NECKS STRETCHED TRYING TO SEE AND PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE TRYING TO SHOVE THEM BACK AND SHOUTING BACK BACK
 DON'T I TELL YOU IT'S IN THE BOOKS
 WE GOT TO BE HERE THREE DAYS
 I DON'T REMEMBER IT SO THE KING LET GO OF ME AND BEGUN TO CUSS THAT TOWN AND EVERYBODY IN IT
ALL RIGHTTHAT'S MIGHTY GOOD
LOOK AT LADY JANE GREY HE SAYS
I SET DOWN ONE TIME BACK IN THE WOODS AND HAD A LONG THINK ABOUT IT
 I ONLY WANT TO GO ALONG BY BUT THE DOGS WON'T LET ME WHAT ARE YOU PROWLING AROUND HERE THIS TIME OF NIGHT FORHEY I WARN'T PROWLING AROUND SIR I FELL OVERBOARD OFF OF THE STEAMBOAT OH YOU DID DID YOU
 I RUN ACROSS HIM IN THE WOODS ABOUT AN HOUR OR TWO AGO AND HE SAID IF I HOLLERED HE'D CUT MY LIVERS OUTAND TOLD ME TO LAY DOWN AND STAY WHERE I WAS
WHY IT'S FROM ST PETERSBURGIT'S FROM SIS I ALLOWED ANOTHER WALK WOULD DO ME GOOD
THEN WE LIT THE PIPES AND DANGLED OUR LEGS IN THE WATER AND TALKED ABOUT ALL KINDS OF THINGSWE WAS ALWAYS NAKED DAY AND NIGHT WHENEVER THE MOSQUITOES WOULD LET USTHE NEW CLOTHES BUCK'S FOLKS MADE FOR ME WAS TOO GOOD TO BE COMFORTABLE AND BESIDES I DIDN'T GO MUCH ON CLOTHES NOHOW
DON'T TOUCH MEDON'T
 AND EVERY TIME I WAKED UP I THOUGHT SOMEBODY HAD ME BY THE NECK
 IT WOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD TO LAND YONDER WHERE THE LIGHT ISIT'S ONLY A WOOD-YARD
SO THE OLD MAN SAID COME ALONG LET SID FOOT IT HOME OR CANOE IT WHEN HE GOT DONE FOOLING AROUNDBUT WE WOULD RIDE
BUT WHEN HE SEE IT WAS ONLY ME HE TOOK A GOOD GAP AND STRETCH AND THEN HE SAYS
 _WELL DEN IS JIM GYWNE TO SAY IT
ANYHOW THERE'S ONE THINGTHERE'S MORE HONOR IN GETTING HIM OUT THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS WHERE THERE WARN'T ONE OF THEM FURNISHED TO YOU BY THE PEOPLE WHO IT WAS THEIR DUTY TO FURNISH THEM AND YOU HAD TO CONTRIVE THEM ALL OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD
 BUT I NOTICED DEY WUZ A NIGGER TRADER ROUN DE PLACE CONSIDABLE LATELY EN I BEGIN TO GIT ONEASY
 I WON'T HAVE IT
AND IF HE DONE IT AGAIN HE MUST BE KILLED
 SHE DONE IT SO BEAUTIFUL IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR
BUT I'VE TOLD HIM A MANY A TIME T I WOULDN'T TRADE PLACES WITH HIM
LOOK ME IN DE EYE
 I AIN'T AS RICH AS OLD JIM HORNBACK AND I CAN'T BE SO BLAME GENEROUS AND GOOD TO TOM DICK AND HARRY AS WHAT HE IS AND SLAM AROUND MONEY THE WAY HE DOES
 SO WE UNHITCHED A SKIFF AND PULLED DOWN THE RIVER TWO MILE AND A HALF TO THE BIG SCAR ON THE HILLSIDE AND WENT ASHORE
 I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING JUST AS YOU'VE TOLD ME
 I'LL WAIT AND WHEN HE COMES BACK IF HE SAYS HE'S GOT TO GO ANY MORE I'LL GET DOWN THERE TOO IF I SWIM
 AT LAST I SAYS
 SO NOW THE FRAUDS RECKONED THEY WAS OUT OF DANGER AND THEY BEGUN TO WORK THE VILLAGES AGAIN
 ALL RIGHT
 NOW WOULDN'T HE
SOMETIMES A STACK OF PEOPLE WOULD COME THERE HORSEBACK FROM TEN OR FIFTEEN MILE AROUND AND STAY FIVE OR SIX DAYS AND HAVE SUCH JUNKETINGS ROUND ABOUT AND ON THE RIVER AND DANCES AND PICNICS IN THE WOODS DAYTIMES AND BALLS AT THE HOUSE NIGHTS
HE HAD AN UNCOMMON LEVEL HEAD FOR A NIGGER
ONE SAYS
 BUT SHE DIDN'T COME
 NOW BEN ROGERS DO YOU WANT TO DO THINGS REGULAR OR DON'T YOU?THAT'S THE IDEA
BOGGS I LOOKED OVER THERE TO SEE WHO SAID IT AND IT WAS THAT COLONEL SHERBURN
 BUT IT'S AWLUZ JIS SO
 IT'S THE GIFT OF HIM THAT LAYS YONDER COLD BUT JOYFUL MARY JANE SHE WENT FOR HIM SUSAN AND THE HARE-LIP WENT FOR THE DUKE AND THEN SUCH ANOTHER HUGGING AND KISSING I NEVER SEE YET
 JIM LIKED THAT NOTION
 IT'S THE BEATENEST THING I EVER STRUCK
IS IT THEM AND SOMEBODY TROTTING ALONG WITH THE GANG WOULD ANSWER BACK AND SAY
 I DIDN'T SAY ANY MORE BUT I DONE SOME THINKING
 IF HE GOT A NOTION IN HIS HEAD ONCE THERE WARN'T NO GETTING IT OUT AGAIN
 WELL THEN WE WON'T BLOW ON THEM SAYING THEM WORDS PUT A GOOD IDEA IN MY HEAD
IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO GET THERE
HUCK DONE IT
 ANYWAYS THEY STAYED AWAY FROM US AND IF MY BUILDING THE FIRE NEVER FOOLED THEM IT WARN'T NO FAULT OF MINE
THERE WAS GOING TO BE A CIRCUS THERE THAT AFTERNOON AND THE COUNTRY PEOPLE WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO COME IN IN ALL KINDS OF OLD SHACKLY WAGONS AND ON HORSES
 SO SHE'D HAD A ROUGH TIME
THERE'S A GANG OF MURDERERS IN YONDER AND IF WE DON'T HUNT UP THEIR BOAT AND SET HER DRIFTING DOWN THE RIVER SO THESE FELLOWS CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THE WRECK THERE'S ONE OF EM GOING TO BE IN A BAD FIX
 IT'S JEST A SMALL THIN BLUE ARROWTHAT'S WHAT IT IS
BUT I TOUCHED THE CURTAIN THAT HID MARY JANE'S FROCKS SO I JUMPED IN BEHIND THAT AND SNUGGLED IN AMONGST THE GOWNS AND STOOD THERE PERFECTLY STILL
 I DIDN'T WAIT FOR NO BREAKFASTI WARN'T HUNGRY OLD MAN SAID THE YOUNG ONE I RECKON WE MIGHT DOUBLE-TEAM IT TOGETHER
 A BODY MIGHT STUMP HIS TOE AND TAKE PISON AND FALL DOWN THE WELL AND BREAK HIS NECK AND BUST HIS BRAINS OUT AND SOMEBODY COME ALONG AND ASK WHAT KILLED HIM AND SOME NUMSKULL UP AND SAY WHY HE STUMPED HIS TOE  WOULD THER BE ANY SENSE IN THAT
BUT AS I WAS SAYING WE'D GOT ALL THE WORK DONE NOW AT LAST
YES WHEREABOUTS SAYS I
YOU'S BACK AGIN LIVE EN SOUN JIS DE SAME OLE HUCKDE SAME OLE HUCK THANKS TO GOODNESS WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU JIM
AND TOM SUPERINTENDED
FOR IF HE DIDN'T GET SAVED HE WOULD GET DROWNDED
SO I STARTED FOR TOWN IN THE WAGON AND WHEN I WAS HALF-WAY I SEE A WAGON COMING AND SURE ENOUGH IT WAS TOM SAWYER AND I STOPPED AND WAITED TILL HE COME ALONG
 WHEN HE GOT A-FRONT OF US HE LIFTS HIS HAT EVER SO GRACIOUS AND DAINTY LIKE IT WAS THE LID OF A BOX THAT HAD BUTTERFLIES ASLEEP IN IT AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO DISTURB THEM AND SAYS
 BUT MOS'LY I WISHT DEY'D LEMME LONE I DOES TOM SAYS
SO THEY HAD IT NIP AND TUCK FOR FIVE MILE OR MORE THE OLD MAN A-GAINING ALL THE TIME
 WHERE WOULD HE LIVE BUT I THOUGHT YOU LIVED IN SHEFFIELD I SEE I WAS UP A STUMP
 BY AND BY ONE SHOWED
 SHE NEVER TOLD ME WHY AND I COULDN'T MAKE IT OUT NO WAY
AND IT AIN'T LIKELY THERE'S TWO PRISONERS ON SUCH A LITTLE PLANTATION AND WHERE THE PEOPLE'S ALL SO KIND AND GOOD
 BOGGS AND THE MEN TURNED ROUND TO SEE WHO CALLED HIM AND WHEN THEY SEE THE PISTOL THE MEN JUMPED TO ONE SIDE AND THE PISTOL-BARREL COME DOWN SLOW AND STEADY TO A LEVELBOTH BARRELS COCKED
THE MINUTE HE WAS ON THE HORSE BEGUN TO RIP AND TEAR AND JUMP AND CAVORT AROUND WITH TWO CIRCUS MEN HANGING ON TO HIS BRIDLE TRYING TO HOLD HIM AND THE DRUNK MAN HANGING ON TO HIS NECK AND HIS HEELS FLYING IN THE AIR EVERY JUMP AND THE WHOLE CROWD OF PEOPLE STANDING UP SHOUTING AND LAUGHING TILL TEARS ROLLED DOWN
 WHAT YOU RECKON I BETTER DO
 IT MADE ME FEEL SO MEAN I COULD ALMOST KISSED HIS FOOT TO GET HIM TO TAKE IT BACK
 I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEADI'D GOT TO THROW UP MY HAND
 THEN PRETTY SOON HE SAYS
IT'S A DEAD MAN
 'RING UP FAIR ROSAMUN  FAIR ROSAMUN ANSWERS THE BELL
 IS DEY OUT O SIGHT YIT
 WE FOLLOWED THE MEN AND THE DOGS BUT THEY OUTRUN US AND WE LOST THEM
THEN I RAISED A YELL
SPOS'N IT TAKES HIM THREE OR FOUR DAYS
 HERE WAS A BOY THAT WAS RESPECTABLE AND WELL BRUNG UP
 IT GIVE THE DWELLING-HOUSE AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS GOLD TO THE GIRLS
BUT NO THEY MUST COUNT IT
 THAT'S WHY I COME
AND CALLED US HONEY AND ALL THE PET NAMES HE COULD THINK OF
I DOAN WANT TO GO FOOL'N LONG ER NO WRACK
 IF HE WAS BOUND TO HAVE IT SO I COULDN'T HELP IT
AND WHEN YOU GET THROUGH ROBBING IT YOU'LL COME BACK HERE AND WONDER WHAT HAS BECOME OF ME AND JIM AND THE RAFTAND YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT IN WONDERING AND HE SAID IF HE WARN'T BACK BY MIDDAY THE DUKE AND ME WOULD KNOW IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND WE WAS TO COME ALONG
 THINKS I THE OLD MAN WILL BE GLAD WHEN HE SEES THISSHE'S WORTH TEN DOLLARS
EN DISH YER DOLLAR BILL'S DE CHILE
THE PEOPLE THAT HAD SEEN THE THING SAID HE DONE IT PERFECT
THEN I SET TO THINKING OVER HOW TO GET AT IT AND TURNED OVER SOME CONSIDERABLE MANY WAYS IN MY MIND
COME OUT FROM UNDER THAT BED HUCK FINN SO I DONE IT
YES YOU BETTER TURN Y'R HEAD AWAYI WOULD IF I WAS YOU TOM OH DEARY ME SAYS AUNT SALLY
 I SEE HOW MAYBE I COULD GET ME AND JIM RID OF THE FRAUDS
EN HOW'S A BODY GWYNE TO HIT UM WID A ROCK
 HE USED TO MARRY A NEW WIFE EVERY DAY AND CHOP OFF HER HEAD NEXT MORNING
 IT WOULDN'T STRAIN ME NONE AFTER I GOT MY HAND IN
AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUT-GAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T
 SO WE CLEARED OUT FOR THE HOUSE
 I BEGUN TO SUSPICION SOMETHING
AUNT SALLY WAS A GOOD DEAL UNEASY
 I OUT WITH MY KNIFE AND CUT THE ROPE AND AWAY WE WENT
DEY'S MIGHTY GOOD TO ME DESE NIGGERS IS EN WHATEVER I WANTS M TO DO FUR ME I DOAN HAVE TO AST M TWICE HONEY

 I SET PERFECTLY STILL THEN LISTENING TO MY HEART THUMP AND I RECKON I DIDN'T DRAW A BREATH WHILE IT THUMPED A HUNDRED
 I SHOVED THE WHOLE THING OUT OF MY HEAD AND SAID I WOULD TAKE UP WICKEDNESS AGAIN WHICH WAS IN MY LINE BEING BRUNG UP TO IT AND THE OTHER WARN'T
AND IT DIDN'T
I KNOW WHAT YOU'LL SAY
 A PRISONER'S GOT TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A DUMB PET AND IF A RATTLESNAKE HAIN'T EVER BEEN TRIED WHY THERE'S MORE GLORY TO BE GAINED IN YOUR BEING THE FIRST TO EVER TRY IT THAN ANY OTHER WAY YOU COULD EVER THINK OF TO SAVE YOUR LIFE WHY MARS TOM I DOAN WANT NO SICH GLORY
 SOME OF THE OLD WOMEN WAS KNITTING AND SOME OF THE YOUNG FOLKS WAS COURTING ON THE SLY
AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
 I SEE UM GO BY HEAHWATCHED UM THOO DE BUSHES SOME YOUNG BIRDS COME ALONG FLYING A YARD OR TWO AT A TIME AND LIGHTING
 HE TURNED BLUE ALL OVER AND DIED IN THE HOPE OF A GLORIOUS RESURRECTION
BUT WHEN I PADDLED AHEAD IN THE CANOE WITH THE LINE TO MAKE FAST THERE WARN'T ANYTHING BUT LITTLE SAPLINGS TO TIE TO
THE DUKE HE HIRED THE COURT HOUSE AND WE WENT AROUND AND STUCK UP OUR BILLS
 EARLY IN DE MAWNIN SOME ER DE NIGGERS COME ALONG GWYNE TO DE FIELDS EN DEY TUK ME EN SHOWED ME DIS PLACE WHAH DE DOGS CAN'T TRACK ME ON ACCOUNTS O DE WATER EN DEY BRINGS ME TRUCK TO EAT EVERY NIGHT EN TELLS ME HOW YOU'S A-GITT'N ALONG WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL MY JACK TO FETCH ME HERE SOONER JIM WELL TWARN'T NO USE TO STURB YOU HUCK TELL WE COULD DO SUMFNBUT WE'S ALL RIGHT NOW
 BUT WHEN I GOT TO SHORE PAP WASN'T IN SIGHT YET AND AS I WAS RUNNING HER INTO A LITTLE CREEK LIKE A GULLY ALL HUNG OVER WITH VINES AND WILLOWS I STRUCK ANOTHER IDEA
 WHEN HE'S DRUNK THERE AIN'T NO NEAR-SIGHTED MAN COULD TELL HIM FROM A KING WELL ANYWAYS I DOAN HANKER FOR NO MO UN UM HUCK

 THISH YER COMES OF TRUST'N TO PROVIDENCE
 COME ALONG OLD HOSS COLD CORN-PONE COLD CORN-BEEF BUTTER AND BUTTERMILKTHAT IS WHAT THEY HAD FOR ME DOWN THERE AND THERE AIN'T NOTHING BETTER THAT EVER I'VE COME ACROSS YET
 I TRIED TO MAKE OUT TO MYSELF THAT I WARN'T TO BLAME BECAUSE I DIDN'T RUN JIM OFF FROM HIS RIGHTFUL OWNER
 IT LL ONLY MAKE THINGS ONCOMFORTABLE
 WE GOT FIVE CATFISH OFF THE LINES AND WENT HOME
 THERE WARN'T ANY SIGNS OF THE BAR AT THE HEADIT WAS ALL UNDER WATER NOW
 THEN THE PEOPLE BEGUN TO HOLLER AT HIM AND MAKE FUN OF HIM AND THAT MADE HIM MAD AND HE BEGUN TO RIP AND TEAR
THIS YOUNG GIRL KEPT A SCRAP-BOOK WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE AND USED TO PASTE OBITUARIES AND ACCIDENTS AND CASES OF PATIENT SUFFERING IN IT OUT OF THE PRESBYTERIAN OBSERVER AND WRITE POETRY AFTER THEM OUT OF HER OWN HEAD
BUT HE SAID I MUST GO IN THE DARK AND LOOK SHARP
THERE AIN'T NO GOOD WAY BUT ONE
 YES IT WAS MORTIFICATIONTHAT WAS IT
 THE LIGHTNING SHOWED HER VERY DISTINCT
 TAKE OFF YOUR BONNET NO I SAYS
BUT IF JULIET'S SUCH A YOUNG GAL DUKE MY PEELED HEAD AND MY WHITE WHISKERS IS GOIN TO LOOK ONCOMMON ODD ON HER MAYBE NO DON'T YOU WORRY

MR GARRICK
MR GARRICK
BY AND BY IT WAS GETTING-UP TIME
 MARY JANE WILKS YOU KNOW ME FOR YOUR FRIEND AND FOR YOUR UNSELFISH FRIEND TOO
 I JUDGED SHE WOULD BE PROUD OF ME FOR HELPING THESE RAPSCALLIONS BECAUSE RAPSCALLIONS AND DEAD BEATS IS THE KIND THE WIDOW AND GOOD PEOPLE TAKES THE MOST INTEREST IN
 THEY TOOK HIM AND BURIED HIM ON THE BANK
AND BOTH OF THEM SET AT THE TABLE THINKING AND NOT SAYING NOTHING AND LOOKING MOURNFUL AND THEIR COFFEE GETTING COLD AND NOT EATING ANYTHING
 THE MISSOURI NEGRO DIALECT
 BUT I RECKON I GOT TO LIGHT OUT FOR THE TERRITORY AHEAD OF THE REST BECAUSE AUNT SALLY SHE'S GOING TO ADOPT ME AND SIVILIZE ME AND I CAN'T STAND IT
THEN THE MEN SEE THEM AND JUMPED ON THEIR HORSES AND TOOK OUT AFTER THEM
 AND IT TAKES THEM WEEKS AND WEEKS AND WEEKS AND FOR EVER AND EVER
THEN THE NIGHT YOU'RE READY FETCH THE LEG A KICK DOWN SHE GOES
CHAPTER XVI
CHAPTER XVI
HUCK LOSES THE RAFT.IN THE FOG.HUCK FINDS THE RAFT.TRASH
PO LITTLE CHAP BUT SOME SAYS HE GOT OUT AND GOT AWAY AND COME TO AMERICA DAT'S GOOD
WE'RE GOING TO SET YOU FREE JIM ONLY HAD TIME TO GRAB US BY THE HAND AND SQUEEZE IT
HOW'M I GOING TO GUESS SAYS I WHEN I NEVER HEARD TELL OF IT BEFORE BUT YOU CAN GUESS CAN'T YOU
EN I TOLE YOU I BEN RICH WUNST EN GWINETER TO BE RICH AGIN
I JUDGED IT WOULD HAVE TOOK TOO LONG TO MAKE SO MANY
FOR WHAT YOU WANT ABOVE ALL THINGS ON A RAFT IS FOR EVERYBODY TO BE SATISFIED AND FEEL RIGHT AND KIND TOWARDS THE OTHERS
BUT I THINKS IT'S SAKES ALIVE I HOPE IT AIN'T HANNER I'M SORRY TO SAY IT I SAYS BUT HANNER'S THE VERY ONE MY GOODNESS AND SHE SO WELL ONLY LAST WEEK
AND DO YOU RECKON ANYBODY'S GOING TO RESK HIS LIFE FOR A TEXAS AND A PILOT-HOUSE SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS WHEN IT'S LIKELY TO BREAK UP AND WASH OFF DOWN THE RIVER ANY MINUTE  JIM COULDN'T SAY NOTHING TO THAT SO HE DIDN'T TRY
 I SLID OUT AND AS I PASSED THE DINING-ROOM I THOUGHT I'D MAKE SURE THEM WATCHERS HADN'T SEEN ME
 I LAY HE'D WAIT A POW'FUL LONG TIME FO I AST HIM
 IT WAS BAKER'S BREAD"WHAT THE QUALITY EAT
 SO WHEN WE SEE THE RAFT WAS GONE AND WE FLAT BROKE THERE WARN'T ANYTHING FOR IT BUT TO TRY THE ROYAL NONESUCH ANOTHER SHAKE
ON THE RIVER FRONT SOME OF THE HOUSES WAS STICKING OUT OVER THE BANK AND THEY WAS BOWED AND BENT AND ABOUT READY TO TUMBLE IN
 I SCRATCHED AROUND AMONGST THE OLD TOOLS AND GOT A PICKAXE AND GIVE IT TO HIM AND HE TOOK IT AND WENT TO WORK AND NEVER SAID A WORD
I DON'T WISH TO BE TOO HARD ON THESE TWO MEN BUT I THINK THEY'RE FRAUDS AND THEY MAY HAVE COMPLICES THAT WE DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
AND HE'S GOT TO TOO
THERE'S A HAND THAT WAS THE HAND OF A HOG
 JIM THROWED SOME OLD RAGS OVER HIM BUT HE NEEDN'T DONE IT
IT WAS HURTING HIM CONSIDERABLE AND BLEEDING
SHE DON'T CLAP THEM TOGETHER THE WAY YOU DID WHEN YOU CATCHED THE LUMP OF LEAD
AND IF SHE IS SHE'LL BE HOME IN THE MORNING ANYWAY
COME ALONG SO THEY GOT OUT AND WENT IN
 JIM SAID HE BELIEVED IT WAS SPIRITS
 SHE SAID SHE'D HAVE HER FROCKS AND A LOT OF OTHER TRAPS TOOK OUT OF HER ROOM IF THEY WAS IN UNCLE HARVEY'S WAY BUT HE SAID THEY WARN'T
ANOTHER ONE WAS A SHARP-LOOKING GENTLEMAN WITH A CARPET-BAG OF THE OLD-FASHIONED KIND MADE OUT OF CARPET-STUFF THAT HAD JUST COME OFF OF THE STEAMBOAT AND WAS TALKING TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE AND GLANCING TOWARDS THE KING NOW AND THEN AND NODDING THEIR HEADSIT WAS LEVI BELL THE LAWYER THAT WAS GONE UP TO LOUISVILLE
 SNAKE TAKE N BITE JIM'S CHIN OFF DEN WHAH IS DE GLORY
WE'LL COME DOWN TO THE VILLAGE ON HER I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE ORDERED TWICE TO GO AND TAKE A STEAMBOAT RIDE
AND FOUND YOU WARN'T UP AND SO THEY WAS HOPING TO SLIDE OUT OF THE WAY OF TROUBLE WITHOUT WAKING YOU UP IF THEY HADN'T ALREADY WAKED YOU UP GREAT GUNS THIS IS A GO SAYS THE KING
HE MIGHT TELL WHO TOLD HIM
AND THEN FOR THREE MINUTES OR MAYBE FOUR I NEVER SEE TWO MEN LEAK THE WAY THEY DONE
BUT THEY DIDN'T THINK OF IT AND I RECKONED IT WARN'T BEST FOR ME TO MIX IN BUT I JUDGED I'D GET THE DOCTOR'S YARN TO AUNT SALLY SOMEHOW OR OTHER AS SOON AS I'D GOT THROUGH THE BREAKERS THAT WAS LAYING JUST AHEAD OF MEEXPLANATIONS I MEAN OF HOW I FORGOT TO MENTION ABOUT SID BEING SHOT WHEN I WAS TELLING HOW HIM AND ME PUT IN THAT DRATTED NIGHT PADDLING AROUND HUNTING THE RUNAWAY NIGGER
 THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY HOWDY-DO WOULDN'T IT
 BUT HE DIDN'T GIT MUCH CHANCE TO ENJOY HIS LUCK FOR INSIDE OF A WEEK OUR FOLKS LAID HIM OUT I RECKON THAT OLD MAN WAS A COWARD BUCK I RECKON HE WARN'T A COWARD
ANOTHER TIME A MAN COMES A-PROWLING ROUND HERE YOU ROUST ME OUT YOU HEAR
SO THEN WE WAS PRETTY SCARED AND MADE UP AN AGREEMENT THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE NOTHING IN THE WORLD TO DO WITH SUCH ACTIONS AND IF WE EVER GOT THE LEAST SHOW WE WOULD GIVE THEM THE COLD SHAKE AND CLEAR OUT AND LEAVE THEM BEHIND
 JUMP UP AND CRACK YO HEELS
 WHEN WE UZ MOS DOWN TO DE HEAD ER DE ISLAN A MAN BEGIN TO COME AFT WID DE LANTERN I SEE IT WARN'T NO USE FER TO WAIT SO I SLID OVERBOARD EN STRUCK OUT FER DE ISLAN  WELL I HAD A NOTION I COULD LAN MOS ANYWHERS BUT I COULDN'TBANK TOO BLUFF
 THEY GAINED ON THE BOYS BUT IT DIDN'T DO NO GOOD THE BOYS HAD TOO GOOD A START
SO HE ALLOWED HE WOULD ADVERTISE JIM IN THE ST LOUIS AND NEW ORLEANS PAPERS
 ALL MY TROUBLES WAS GONE
AND WHEN YOU PRESSED DOWN ON THEM THEY SQUEAKED BUT DIDN'T OPEN THEIR MOUTHS NOR LOOK DIFFERENT NOR INTERESTED
 BUT HE HAD TO HAVE IT
THE BOOT ON THAT FOOT WAS BUSTED AND TWO OF HIS TOES STUCK THROUGH AND HE WORKED THEM NOW AND THEN
AND IF I COULD THINK UP ANYTHING WORSE I WOULD DO THAT TOO
 BY AND BY HE SAID HE HAD CIPHERED OUT TWO OR THREE WAYS BUT THERE WARN'T NO NEED TO DECIDE ON ANY OF THEM YET
 THERE IS A DESPRATE GANG OF CUTTHROATS FROM OVER IN THE INDIAN TERRITORY GOING TO STEAL YOUR RUNAWAY NIGGER TO-NIGHT AND THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SCARE YOU SO AS YOU WILL STAY IN THE HOUSE AND NOT BOTHER THEM
PUSH THE DOOR OPEN YOURSELFJUST ENOUGH TO SQUEEZE IN D YOU HEAR I DIDN'T HURRY
IF I TROD ON A STICK AND BROKE IT IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE A PERSON HAD CUT ONE OF MY BREATHS IN TWO AND I ONLY GOT HALF AND THE SHORT HALF TOO
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO WALK ALL THE WAY UP TO THE STEAMBOAT FOR BECAUSE SHE'S A BIG ORLEANS BOAT AND I WAS AFEARD SHE MIGHTN'T STOP THERE
 IT WAS ABOUT SUNDOWN
 HE WAS WELL BORN AS THE SAYING IS AND THAT'S WORTH AS MUCH IN A MAN AS IT IS IN A HORSE SO THE WIDOW DOUGLAS SAID AND NOBODY EVER DENIED THAT SHE WAS OF THE FIRST ARISTOCRACY IN OUR TOWN
 THINK O THAT NOW
AND THE BOY BEING IN A KIND OF A FLIGHTY SLEEP TOO WE MUFFLED THE OARS AND HITCHED THE RAFT ON AND TOWED HER OVER VERY NICE AND QUIET AND THE NIGGER NEVER MADE THE LEAST ROW NOR SAID A WORD FROM THE START
SO WE WENT BACK AND GOT THE CANOE AND PADDLED UP ABREAST THE CAVERN AND LUGGED ALL THE TRAPS UP THERE
YONDER WAS THE BANKS AND THE ISLANDS ACROSS THE WATER
 HE SAYS

FOR WHO WOULD FARDELS BEAR TILL BIRNAM WOOD DO COME TO DUNSINANE BUT THAT THE FEAR OF SOMETHING AFTER DEATH MURDERS THE INNOCENT SLEEP GREAT NATURE'S SECOND COURSE AND MAKES US RATHER SLING THE ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE THAN FLY TO OTHERS THAT WE KNOW NOT OF
BUT NIGHTS LIKE THIS THEY BULL RIGHT UP THE CHANNEL AGAINST THE WHOLE RIVER
YOURS TRULY HUCK FINN
IF YOU EVER DENY IT AGAIN I'LL DROWN YOU
BUT I HAD PLENTY TIME
THE BEST AUTHORITIES USES THEIR OWN BLOOD
ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS DEC'D AND DID YOUNG STEPHEN SICKEN    AND DID YOUNG STEPHEN DIE
 I WISHT I HAD DE MONEY I WOULDN WANT NO MO CHAPTER IX
BY AND BY HE RAISED UP PART WAY AND LISTENED WITH HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE
 NOW WE WAS IN THE LEAN-TO AND HEARD TRAMPINGS CLOSE BY OUTSIDE
AS WE WENT BY OUR HOUSE I WISHED I HADN'T SENT MARY JANE OUT OF TOWN
 I WANTED TO GET ABOARD OF HER AND SLINK AROUND A LITTLE AND SEE WHAT THERE WAS THERE
AND THEN WE UP-STEAM AGAIN AND WHIZZED ALONG AFTER THEM TILL WE WAS NEARLY TO THE MILL AND THEN STRUCK UP THROUGH THE BUSH TO WHERE MY CANOE WAS TIED AND HOPPED IN AND PULLED FOR DEAR LIFE TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER BUT DIDN'T MAKE NO MORE NOISE THAN WE WAS OBLEEGED TO
AND I KNOW WHERE I HID IT BUT I'M AFRAID IT AIN'T THERE NO MORE
I'LL TAKE THE CANOE AND GO AND SEE JIM
 I COULD SWEAR THEY WAS BEATS AND BUMMERS THAT'S ALL THOUGH THAT'S WORTH SOMETHING
 THEY AGREED TO GET TOGETHER AND FIX A DAY AS SOON AS THEY COULD AND THEN WE ELECTED TOM SAWYER FIRST CAPTAIN AND JO HARPER SECOND CAPTAIN OF THE GANG AND SO STARTED HOME
HIS MEAT'S AS WHITE AS SNOW AND MAKES A GOOD FRY
 NOW LEAVE_AND TAKE YOUR HALF-A-MAN WITH YOU"TOSSING HIS GUN UP ACROSS HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS THIS
 THERE AIN'T BUT ONE
 IT MAKES ME FEEL RIDICULOUS TO THINK I WAS SOFT ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT RUBBAGE
I'LL HELP YOU STEAL HIM WELL I LET GO ALL HOLTS THEN LIKE I WAS SHOT
THEN THE PEOPLE BEGUN TO FLOCK IN AND THE BEATS AND THE GIRLS TOOK SEATS IN THE FRONT ROW AT THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN AND FOR A HALF AN HOUR THE PEOPLE FILED AROUND SLOW IN SINGLE RANK AND LOOKED DOWN AT THE DEAD MAN'S FACE A MINUTE AND SOME DROPPED IN A TEAR AND IT WAS ALL VERY STILL AND SOLEMN ONLY THE GIRLS AND THE BEATS HOLDING HANDKERCHIEFS TO THEIR EYES AND KEEPING THEIR HEADS BENT AND SOBBING A LITTLE
SO WHEN HE'D SQUARED UP THERE WARN'T NOTHING LEFT BUT SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND OUR NIGGER JIM
BUT IT SEEMED A SIGHT LONGER THAN THAT
SAYS I
 IT WAS DREADFUL LONESOME
 I FOLLOWED AROUND TO SEE
 THEN THEY PULLED HIS DAUGHTER AWAY FROM HIM SCREAMING AND CRYING AND TOOK HER OFF
BUT NOW HE WAS A-GOING TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF AND BE A MAN NOBODY WOULDN'T BE ASHAMED OF AND HE HOPED THE JUDGE WOULD HELP HIM AND NOT LOOK DOWN ON HIM
 THEN WE HEARD STEPS ON THE STAIRS AND BLOWED OUT OUR LIGHT AND HID
AND IF I HAD I COULDN'T A DONE IT BECAUSE THAT NIGGER BUSTED IN AND SAYS
 HOW CAN THEY GET LOOSE WHEN THERE'S A GUARD OVER THEM READY TO SHOOT THEM DOWN IF THEY MOVE A PEG A GUARD
YOU SEE IT SAYS FOR A CONSIDERATION  THAT MEANS I HAVE BOUGHT IT OF YOU AND PAID YOU FOR IT
THEY SAID HE COULD VOTE WHEN HE WAS AT HOME
BUT THE OLD LADY SAYS
 WE'LL RUSTLE AROUND AND GATHER UP WHATEVER PICKINS WE'VE OVERLOOKED IN THE STATEROOMS AND SHOVE FOR SHORE AND HIDE THE TRUCK
 I SET UP A SHOUTAND THEN ANOTHERAND THEN ANOTHER ONE
GOES THE SECOND ONE AND HE TUMBLES BACKWARDS ON TO THE GROUND HEAVY AND SOLID WITH HIS ARMS SPREAD OUT
 SO THEY WENT OFF A-JAWING
AND I WISHED I COULD TELL HER A THOUSAND LIES SO SHE COULD DO IT AGAIN
BUT I WAS SO SLEEPY I COULDN'T HELP IT
 THEN THE DUKE TOOK AND WROTE OUT A SIGN ON A SHINGLE SO
BECAUSE THE RUNAWAY NIGGER TOLD BURTON AND ME ALL ABOUT THAT SCANDALOUS SHOW AND BURTON SAID HE WOULD TELL THE PEOPLE
I HAIN'T READ IT YET BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT I'VE GOT THAT ONE I WANTED TO OFFER TO BET TWO DOLLARS SHE HADN'T BUT I RECKONED MAYBE IT WAS JUST AS SAFE TO NOT TO
SAY SAYS THE DUKE I GOT ANOTHER IDEA
EN I FEEL SOSOI DOAN KNOW HOW I FEEL
IT WAS A MIGHTY NICE FAMILY AND A MIGHTY NICE HOUSE TOO
 I DIDN'T TAKE NOTICE NOR LET ON
AND HE COMES A-FUMBLING UNDER THE CURTAIN TWO OR THREE FOOT FROM WHERE I WAS
 WE WOULD A TOOK THE BOTTLE BUT IT WAS BROKE
 THINK O THAT BED-LEG SAWED OFF THAT A WAY S'E
AND YET I'D A SOLD HER FOR FIFTEEN BEFORE AND THOUGHT TWAS ALL SHE WAS WORTH THAT'S ALL HE SAID
THE THIRD NIGHT THE HOUSE WAS CRAMMED AGAINAND THEY WARN'T NEW-COMERS THIS TIME BUT PEOPLE THAT WAS AT THE SHOW THE OTHER TWO NIGHTS
IT AIN'T NO USE TO TRY TO LEARN YOU NOTHING HUCK
HE'S ALIVE THANK GOD
WELL THE OLD MAN HE LIKED THAT SPEECH AND HE MIGHTY SOON GOT IT SO HE COULD DO IT FIRST RATE
 IF THEY DIDN'T FIND THEM I COULDN'T BEAR TO THINK ABOUT IT
AIN'T THEY NO SHEPHERDSONS AROUND THEY SAID NO TWAS A FALSE ALARM
 IT KEPT A-COMING AND WHEN IT WAS ABREAST OF ME I SEE THERE WARN'T BUT ONE MAN IN IT
BUT AFTER THAT HE NEVER BIT INTO NOTHING BUT WHAT HE JABBED HIS FORK INTO IT IN THREE OR FOUR PLACES FIRST
ANYWAYS IT WAS PLENTY GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
 SOMETIMES A BELT OF LAND A QUARTER OF A MILE DEEP WILL START IN AND CAVE ALONG AND CAVE ALONG TILL IT ALL CAVES INTO THE RIVER IN ONE SUMMER
TOM SAID SO HIMSELF
 I FELT EVER SO THANKFUL
ANYBODY THAT DON'T BELIEVE YET THAT IT'S FOOLISHNESS TO HANDLE A SNAKE-SKIN AFTER ALL THAT THAT SNAKE-SKIN DONE FOR US WILL BELIEVE IT NOW IF THEY READ ON AND SEE WHAT MORE IT DONE FOR US
 WE RECKONED WE WAS ALL GOING TO DIE BUT DIDN'T
 THIS AIN'T NO HEALTHY PLACE FOR A STRANGER TO COME NONOT IMPUDENT WHELPS SID
 LOST THEIR BAGGAGE
WELL AUNT POLLY SHE SAID THAT WHEN AUNT SALLY WROTE TO HER THAT TOM AND SID HAD COME ALL RIGHT AND SAFE SHE SAYS TO HERSELF
HOBSON AND DR ROBINSON WAS DOWN TO THE END OF THE TOWN A-HUNTING TOGETHERTHAT IS I MEAN THE DOCTOR WAS SHIPPING A SICK MAN TO T'OTHER WORLD AND THE PREACHER WAS PINTING HIM RIGHT
 I LIKED THE NIGGER FOR THAT
 IT WAS A MONSTROUS BIG RIVER DOWN THERESOMETIMES A MILE AND A HALF WIDE
 YOU'RE A FRAUD THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE WELL HOW THEY ALL TOOK ON
 EVERYBODY SAID
 THE NIGGERS WAS JUST GETTING THROUGH BREAKFAST AND STARTING FOR THE FIELDS
 SO I SAYS A RAFF IS WHAT I'S ARTER
 NOW WHAT DO YOU RECKON IT IS WELL I DON'T KNOW
 THE WALLS OF ALL THE ROOMS WAS PLASTERED AND MOST HAD CARPETS ON THE FLOORS AND THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS WHITEWASHED ON THE OUTSIDE
 HE SAID WE WAS REPRESENTING PRISONERS
 STEP FORWARD GEORGE JACKSON
 DAH'S DE STUMP DAHDAT'S ONE ER DE WOMEN
 I LAID THERE AND HAD A GOOD REST AND A SMOKE OUT OF MY PIPE LOOKING AWAY INTO THE SKY
AND WHEN I STRUCK THE RAFT AT LAST I WAS SO FAGGED I WOULD A JUST LAID DOWN TO BLOW AND GASP IF I COULD AFFORDED IT
 I GROPED ALONG UP TO MY CUBBY AND HID IT THERE TILL I COULD GET A CHANCE TO DO BETTER
 WELL HE WAS RIGHT
AND WHEN EVERYTHING WAS READY A YOUNG WOMAN SET DOWN AND WORKED IT AND IT WAS PRETTY SKREEKY AND COLICKY AND EVERYBODY JOINED IN AND SUNG AND PETER WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT HAD A GOOD THING ACCORDING TO MY NOTION
 THEN I SET DOWN AND CRIED
IF YOU'D BEEN IN TOWN AT FIRST LEVI BELL THE KING BROKE IN AND REACHED OUT HIS HAND AND SAYS
 YOU HAD BETTER LET ME INVEST IT ALONG WITH YOUR SIX THOUSAND BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE IT YOU'LL SPEND IT NO SIR I SAYS I DON'T WANT TO SPEND IT
 THERE WARN'T A WINDOW TO IT BIG ENOUGH FOR A DOG TO GET THROUGH
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK
I HAIN'T EVER DONE YOU NO HARM
WELLIIWELL THAT OUGHT TO SETTLE IT OF COURSE
 SAY WHERE IS THAT SONGTHAT DRAFT IN THE BANK FOR TO BE COLLECTED
EVERYTHING WAS GOING SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I HAD ALLOWED FOR
YOU SAID IT WAS THE WORST BAD LUCK IN THE WORLD TO TOUCH A SNAKE-SKIN WITH MY HANDS
IS HE HER UNCLE
 CAN'T YOU SEE THAT THEY'D GO AND TELL
JULIET
 AND GOT TO THINKING OVER OUR TRIP DOWN THE RIVER
IT TAKES UP MORE ROOM THAN ALL THE REST OF A PERSON'S INSIDES AND YET AIN'T NO GOOD NOHOW
 I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING AT FIRST BUT NEXT I DID
 EVERY ANIMAL IS GRATEFUL FOR KINDNESS AND PETTING AND THEY WOULDN'T THINK OF HURTING A PERSON THAT PETS THEM
 SO TOM WAS SATISFIED
BUT AFTER THEY'D JUMPED OVERBOARD AND TOOK A SWIM IT CHIPPERED THEM UP A GOOD DEAL
 AND HE HAD GOT IN TEN DOLLARS WORTH OF ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THE PAPER WHICH HE SAID HE WOULD PUT IN FOR FOUR DOLLARS IF THEY WOULD PAY IN ADVANCESO THEY DONE IT
 AND WARN'T THE COOKING GOOD AND JUST BUSHELS OF IT TOO
 I PEEPED OUT THROUGH THE WILLOW BRANCHES AND THERE IT WASA SKIFF AWAY ACROSS THE WATER
 "YOUR AUNT'S BEEN MIGHTY UNEASY SHE NEEDN'T I SAYS BECAUSE WE WAS ALL RIGHT
WHEN I GOT DOWN STAIRS IN THE MORNING THE PARLOR WAS SHUT UP AND THE WATCHERS WAS GONE
JUST A SOLID WALL AS WELL AS I COULD SEE BY THE STARS
BY AND BY SHE COME ALONG AND SHE DRIFTED IN SO CLOSE THAT THEY COULD A RUN OUT A PLANK AND WALKED ASHORE
IT MADE ME FEEL MUCH MORE EASIER THAN WHAT I WAS FEELING BEFORE
HELLO YOU BUT IT DIDN'T BUDGE
AND AS FOR THAT SHEET THEY MADE THE RAG LADDER OUT OF THER AIN'T NO TELLING HOW MANY TIMES THEY DIDN'T STEAL THAT
 MY SOULS BUT I WAS SCARED
AND SHE ASKED ME IF I WOULD DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND NOT TELL ANYBODY AND I SAID I WOULD
THE MEN RIPPED AROUND AWHILE AND THEN RODE AWAY
 I POPPED OUT TO MY ARMPITS AND BLOWED THE WATER OUT OF MY NOSE AND PUFFED A BIT
AND SO HE WILL NAME THE SAME TO WIT AS FOLLOWS VIZZ.:REV
SOMETIMES I HEARD GUNS AWAY OFF IN THE WOODS
 SO I DONE IT
DAH SHE IS BUT IT WARN'T
 I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO TRY
 THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY HOWDY-DO
 THEY PEDDLE OUT SUCH A FISH AS THAT BY THE POUND IN THE MARKET-HOUSE THERE
I'S A FREE MAN EN I COULDN'T EVER BEN FREE EF IT HADN BEN FOR HUCK
 EVERY TIME ONE OF THEM SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE RIVER SIDE OF THE WOODPILE HE GOT SHOT AT
 AND THEN I WENT ON AND TOLD HER ALL WHAT I TOLD UNCLE SILAS BEFORE
 I WAS MOST READY TO CRY
 THERE NOWTHAT'S A SPECIMEN
 TOM JERKED THE DOOR OPEN AND FLUNG OUT A SLAB OF JIM'S MEAT AND THE DOGS WENT FOR IT AND IN TWO SECONDS HE WAS OUT HIMSELF AND BACK AGAIN AND SHUT THE DOOR AND I KNOWED HE'D FIXED THE OTHER DOOR TOO
THE FIFTH NIGHT BELOW ST LOUIS WE HAD A BIG STORM AFTER MIDNIGHT WITH A POWER OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING AND THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN A SOLID SHEET
THEN HE STRUCK OUT OVER THE SWAMP AND WADED ANKLE DEEP AS MUCH AS ANOTHER HALF-MILE
PRETTY SOON HE WAS ALL FAGGED OUT AND FELL DOWN PANTING
 PEOPLE LIVED IN THEM YET BUT IT WAS DANGERSOME BECAUSE SOMETIMES A STRIP OF LAND AS WIDE AS A HOUSE CAVES IN AT A TIME
 THEY HELD THE CANDLE AND TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT ME AND ALL SAID WHY HE AIN'T A SHEPHERDSONNO THERE AIN'T ANY SHEPHERDSON ABOUT HIM  THEN THE OLD MAN SAID HE HOPED I WOULDN'T MIND BEING SEARCHED FOR ARMS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T MEAN NO HARM BY ITIT WAS ONLY TO MAKE SURE
 WE WENT DOWN THE HILL AND FOUND JO HARPER AND BEN ROGERS AND TWO OR THREE MORE OF THE BOYS HID IN THE OLD TANYARD
 HE LINED OUT TWO LINES EVERYBODY SUNG IT AND IT WAS KIND OF GRAND TO HEAR IT THERE WAS SO MANY OF THEM AND THEY DONE IT IN SUCH A ROUSING WAY
QUICK
 WHO EVER HEARD OF A STATE PRISONER ESCAPING BY A HICKRY-BARK LADDER
PREACHER BE HANGED HE'S A FRAUD AND A LIAR
 AND THEY LAUGHED ALL THE TIME AND THAT MADE THE DUKE MAD
THEY GO OUT AND FOLLOW THE BARS AND HUNT FOR EASY WATER UNDER THE REEFS
 HE WAS AWFUL SURPRISED
 SO SHE HAD TO BE SATISFIED
 I WAS TANGLED GOOD NOW
 PRETTY SOON I WENT OUT ON THE ROAD TRYING TO THINK WHAT I BETTER DO AND I RUN ACROSS A BOY WALKING AND ASKED HIM IF HE'D SEEN A STRANGE NIGGER DRESSED SO AND SO AND HE SAYS
 SO I'LL MOSEY ALONG NOW AND SMOUCH A COUPLE OF CASE-KNIVES SMOUCH THREE HE SAYS
 EN I HAIN'T EVER HAD NO DREAM B'FO DAT'S TIRED ME LIKE DIS ONE OH WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT BECAUSE A DREAM DOES TIRE A BODY LIKE EVERYTHING SOMETIMES
 SO WE CREPT TO THE DOOR AND TOM STOPPED US THERE AND PUT HIS EYE TO THE CRACK BUT COULDN'T MAKE OUT NOTHING IT WAS SO DARK
 I POKED ALONG WELL ON TO AN HOUR EVERYTHING STILL AS ROCKS AND SOUND ASLEEP
CHAPTER XXXIII
CHAPTER XXXIII
AND HE'S GONE AGAIN NOT MORE'N AN HOUR AGO
 I COULDN'T MAKE ANYTHING OUT OF THAT SO I PUT THE PAPER IN THE BOOK AGAIN AND WHEN I GOT HOME AND UPSTAIRS THERE WAS MISS SOPHIA IN HER DOOR WAITING FOR ME
 I LANDED BELOW WHERE I JUDGED WAS PHELPS'S PLACE AND HID MY BUNDLE IN THE WOODS AND THEN FILLED UP THE CANOE WITH WATER AND LOADED ROCKS INTO HER AND SUNK HER WHERE I COULD FIND HER AGAIN WHEN I WANTED HER ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE BELOW A LITTLE STEAM SAWMILL THAT WAS ON THE BANK
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT SAYS HE
I DECLARE TO GRACIOUS THER AIN'T BUT NINE SHE SAYS
THEY COME IN AND SHUT THE DOOR
AND THIS OLD RIP OF OURN IS ONE OF THE CLEANEST I'VE STRUCK IN HISTORY
AND A PIECE OF CARPET ON THE FLOORAND YOUR OWN FATHER GOT TO SLEEP WITH THE HOGS IN THE TANYARD
 WHOEVER TOLD YOU'S ANOTHER LUNATIC
 YOU KNOW THAT ONE-LAIGGED NIGGER DAT B'LONGS TO OLD MISTO BRADISH
MORNINGS BEFORE DAYLIGHT I SLIPPED INTO CORNFIELDS AND BORROWED A WATERMELON OR A MUSHMELON OR A PUNKIN OR SOME NEW CORN OR THINGS OF THAT KIND
 YOU COULDN'T TELL THEM FROM THE REAL KIND
THEN SHE TOOK OFF THE HANK AND LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AND VERY PLEASANT AND SAYS
AND THE RAIN WOULD THRASH ALONG BY SO THICK THAT THE TREES OFF A LITTLE WAYS LOOKED DIM AND SPIDER-WEBBY
 THE BILLS SAID
 "YOU'VE PUT ON CONSIDERABLE MANY FRILLS SINCE I BEEN AWAY
 ALL HE'S GOT TO DO IS TO WRITE ON THE PLATE AND THROW IT OUT
DO YOU RECKON THAT NIGGER WOULD BLOW ON US
 YOU JUST TELL ME YOUR SECRET AND TRUST ME
AND T'OTHER CHAP AND A LONG WHITE COTTON NIGHTSHIRT AND A RUFFLED NIGHTCAP TO MATCH
 AND UNCLE SILAS HE TRUSTS EVERYBODY
ALAS ALAS OUR POOR BROTHERGONE AND WE NEVER GOT TO SEE HIM
 BLESS YOU THEY AIN'T GOT NOTH'N TO COMPLAIN OF WELL THE KING HE TALKED HIM BLIND
 SO FOR A MINUTE I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING
 HE'LL NEVER KNOW HOW NIGH HE COME TO GETTING LYNCHED
AND WHEN HE HAD HIS HAND IN AND WAS EXCITED IT WAS PERFECTLY LOVELY THE WAY HE WOULD RIP AND TEAR AND RAIR UP BEHIND WHEN HE WAS GETTING IT OFF
 WANT TO KEEP IT OFF  AND HE SAID
WELL WASN'T HE MAD
 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY I HADN'T UNTIED HER
 IF IT DIDN'T SUIT HIM TO EXPLAIN A THING TO YOU HE WOULDN'T DO IT
 THE NEXT MINUTE I WAS A-SPINNING DOWN STREAM SOFT BUT QUICK IN THE SHADE OF THE BANK
BUT TOM'S BRITCHES CATCHED FAST ON A SPLINTER ON THE TOP RAIL AND THEN HE HEAR THE STEPS COMING SO HE HAD TO PULL LOOSE WHICH SNAPPED THE SPLINTER AND MADE A NOISE
 I NEVER KNOWED B'FO T WAS SO MUCH BOTHER AND TROUBLE TO BE A PRISONER WELL IT ALWAYS IS WHEN IT'S DONE RIGHT
TYING UP DAYTIMES.AN ASTRONOMICAL THEORY.RUNNING A TEMPERANCE REVIVAL.THE DUKE OF BRIDGEWATER.THE TROUBLES OF ROYALTY
AND TOWARDS THE END SOME BEGUN TO GROAN AND SOME BEGUN TO SHOUT
 LET THE COLD WORLD DO ITS WORST
BUT IT AIN'T SO NO MORE
 BUT NO NARY A PALE DID THEY TURN
THOUGH HE SAID IT OFTEN MADE HIM FEEL EASIER AND BETTER FOR A WHILE IF PEOPLE TREATED HIM ACCORDING TO HIS RIGHTS AND GOT DOWN ON ONE KNEE TO SPEAK TO HIM AND ALWAYS CALLED HIM YOUR MAJESTY AND WAITED ON HIM FIRST AT MEALS AND DIDN'T SET DOWN IN HIS PRESENCE TILL HE ASKED THEM
IT MIGHT BE FIVE OR SIX MILES LONG AND MORE THAN HALF A MILE WIDE
JIM THIS IS NICE I SAYS
KASE I DOAN SKASELY EVER CRY SO TOM WAS STUMPED
I STARTED UP THE ILLINOIS SHORE IN THE CANOE JUST AFTER DARK
BUT YOU DON'T EVER THINK OF THAT
YOU'D SEE THE AXE FLASH AND COME DOWNYOU DON'T HEAR NOTHING
 THE FERRYBOAT WAS FLOATING WITH THE CURRENT AND I ALLOWED I'D HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE WHO WAS ABOARD WHEN SHE COME ALONG BECAUSE SHE WOULD COME IN CLOSE WHERE THE BREAD DID
LEGGO THE BOY YOU OLD IDIOT
DID YOU HEAR EM SHOOTING THE CANNON OH YES
 THEY PAWED THE YALLER-BOYS AND SIFTED THEM THROUGH THEIR FINGERS AND LET THEM JINGLE DOWN ON THE FLOOR
 I DOAN MINE ONE ER TWO KINGS BUT DAT'S ENOUGH
SUCH WAS NOT THE FATE OF    YOUNG STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS
DON'T YOU DO IT
SO JIM TOOK UP SOME OF THE TOP PLANKS OF THE RAFT AND BUILT A SNUG WIGWAM TO GET UNDER IN BLAZING WEATHER AND RAINY AND TO KEEP THE THINGS DRY
BUT ALL THE BOYS SAID IT WOULD BE WICKED TO DO IT ON SUNDAY AND THAT SETTLED THE THING
IS YOUR HUSBAND GOING OVER THERE TO-NIGHT OH YES
DAYTIMES WE PADDLED ALL OVER THE ISLAND IN THE CANOE IT WAS MIGHTY COOL AND SHADY IN THE DEEP WOODS EVEN IF THE SUN WAS BLAZING OUTSIDE
IN ANOTHER SECOND OR TWO IT WAS SOLID WHITE AND STILL AGAIN
THE OLD MAN MADE ME GO TO THE SKIFF AND FETCH THE THINGS HE HAD GOT
NOW THE WAY THAT THE BOOK WINDS UP IS THIS
AND THERE I HAD TO STICK RIGHT STRAIGHT ALONG ALL THE REST OF THE DAY AND ALL NIGHT
 I'VE BEEN IN TOWN TWO DAYS AND I HAIN'T HEARD NOTHING BUT ABOUT YOU BEIN RICH
ALL OF A SUDDEN BANG
 I HEARD BUCK'S GUN GO OFF AT MY EAR AND HARNEY'S HAT TUMBLED OFF FROM HIS HEAD
 SO TOM'S AUNT POLLY SHE TOLD ALL ABOUT WHO I WAS AND WHAT
 PRETTY SOON HE SIGHS AND SHAKES HIS HEAD
YOU COULDN'T MAKE NOTHING ELSE OUT
CHAPTER XV

HE WOULDN'T TRUST ME
 SAYS I IF IT COULD STAY WHERE IT IS ALL RIGHT
WHEN SHE WAS SETTING THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING YOU COULD TOUCH HER ON THE BACK OF HER NECK WITH A FEATHER AND SHE WOULD JUMP RIGHT OUT OF HER STOCKINGS
 WHAT DID YOU RECKON HE WANTED WITH IT WHY I THOUGHT HE'D BE IN THE PULPIT ROT HIM I FORGOT HE WAS A PREACHER
THE JUDGE AND THE WIDOW WENT TO LAW TO GET THE COURT TO TAKE ME AWAY FROM HIM AND LET ONE OF THEM BE MY GUARDIAN
 SO HE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND PRETTY SOON HE SAYS
 SO THERE I HAD TO STICK PLUMB UNTIL DAYLIGHT THIS MORNING
 I'LL WUSSHUP DE GROUN UND YO FOOT I WILL ALL RIGHT I'LL DO IT SEEING IT'S YOU AND YOU'VE BEEN GOOD TO US AND SHOWED US THE RUNAWAY NIGGER

 JIM COULD A GOT OUT OF THAT WINDOW-HOLE BEFORE THIS ONLY THERE WOULDN'T BE NO USE TRYING TO TRAVEL WITH A TEN-FOOT CHAIN ON HIS LEG
BUT JACK AIN'T NO STRANGER SO HE SAYS

 THE MATCH WENT OUT AND SO DID WE AND SHOVED IN THE STAPLE AGAIN AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED AS GOOD AS EVER

SO HE CRIED AND HIS WIFE SHE CRIED AGAIN
 BUT IT'S KIND OF SLOW AND TAKES A LONG TIME HAS THIS ONE BEEN GOING ON LONG BUCK WELL I SHOULD RECKON
 AND WE RECKONED THE NIGGERS STOLE IT THAT MADE ME SQUIRM
 WE GOT HOME ALL SAFE
THE WHOLE BILIN OF M S FRAUDS
MY MOTHER'S DOWN SICK AND OUT OF MONEY AND EVERYTHING AND I COME TO TELL MY UNCLE ABNER MOORE
 WHEN WAS THAT IT WAS THE DAY WE HAD THE FUNERAL
 SHE WENT TO THE COFFIN VERY SOFT AND KNEELED DOWN AND LOOKED IN
EN I'S RICH NOW COME TO LOOK AT IT
I AM TO BE OFF A PIECE AND BLOW A TIN HORN IF I SEE ANY DANGER
BUT I COULDN'T STIR

ALL KINGS IS MOSTLY RAPSCALLIONS AS FUR AS I CAN MAKE OUT IS DAT SO YOU READ ABOUT THEM ONCEYOU'LL SEE
 HE SAID THEY WAS CRAWLING UP HIS LEGS
I GREASED IT UP AND WENT TO WORK
THEN THE KING SAYS KIND OF ABSENT-MINDED LIKE
 WHY ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS TO LIFT UP THE BEDSTEAD AND SLIP OFF THE CHAIN
 AND IT WAS THE NIGGERSI JUST EXPECTED IT
 WHEN I WAS FIFTY YARDS OFF JIM SAYS
THEN BEN ROGERS SAYS
 STICK YOUR HEAD DOWN LOWERTHERE THAT'LL DO
SO UP-BOUND BOATS DIDN'T ALWAYS RUN THE CHANNEL BUT HUNTED EASY WATER
COME TO THINK THE LOGS AIN'T A-GOING TO DO
YOU GOT TO INVENT ALL THE DIFFICULTIES
ALL THE STORES WAS ALONG ONE STREET
N S'I YES LOOK AT IT S'IWHAT COULD HE A-WANTED OF IT S'I
 I SAYS TO MYSELF THERE AIN'T NO TELLING BUT I MIGHT COME TO BE A MURDERER MYSELF YET AND THEN HOW WOULD I LIKE IT
JIM IN ROYAL ROBES.THEY TAKE A PASSENGER.GETTING INFORMATION.FAMILY GRIEF
 THE GIRLS SAID THEY HADN'T EVER DREAMED OF SEEING THE FAMILY SEPARATED OR SOLD AWAY FROM THE TOWN
HE SAID IF HE EVER GOT OUT THIS TIME HE WOULDN'T EVER BE A PRISONER AGAIN NOT FOR A SALARY
BUT YOU CAN'T LAY THE SPOON ON THE RATS AND THAT I KNOW WELL SALLY I'M IN FAULT AND I ACKNOWLEDGE IT
 IT AIN'T RIGHT AND IT AIN'T MORAL AND I WOULDN'T LIKE IT TO GET OUT
BUT THE DUKE STAYED HUFFY A GOOD WHILE TILL BY AND BY THE KING SAYS
AND AFTER THAT WE CAN LET ON TO OURSELVES THAT WE WAS AT IT THIRTY-SEVEN YEARS
 I GUESSED I WOULDN'T STAY IN ONE PLACE BUT JUST TRAMP RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY MOSTLY NIGHT TIMES AND HUNT AND FISH TO KEEP ALIVE AND SO GET SO FAR AWAY THAT THE OLD MAN NOR THE WIDOW COULDN'T EVER FIND ME ANY MORE
 LOOKY HERE YOU BREAK FOR THAT LIGHT OVER YONDER-WAY AND TURN OUT WEST WHEN YOU GIT THERE AND ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE OUT YOU'LL COME TO THE TAVERN
 WHAT YOU KNOW BOUT WITCHES AND THAT NIGGER WAS CORKED UP AND HAD TO TAKE A BACK SEAT
AND HE DONE IT PRETTY WELL TOO FOR A SLOUCH
 I WAS BEHIND THE DOOR AND I WAS MIGHTY SORRY FOR YOU MISS MARY JANE IT MADE MY EYES WATER A LITTLE TO REMEMBER HER CRYING THERE ALL BY HERSELF IN THE NIGHT AND THEM DEVILS LAYING THERE RIGHT UNDER HER OWN ROOF SHAMING HER AND ROBBING HER
 YOU BEEN UP TO SOMETHING YOU NO BUSINESS TO AND I LAY I'LL FIND OUT WHAT IT IS BEFORE I'M DONE WITH YOU SO SHE WENT AWAY AS I OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED INTO THE SETTING-ROOM
 WHY THE WAY THEY PLAYED THAT THING IT WOULD FOOL ANYBODY
 AND YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE THEM ANY
WHAT'S THAT YONDER A PIECE OF A RAFT I SAYS
WHEN I STRUCK THE TOWN I SEE THERE WARN'T NOBODY OUT IN THE STORM SO I NEVER HUNTED FOR NO BACK STREETS BUT HUMPED IT STRAIGHT THROUGH THE MAIN ONE
 I'LL PUT YOU UP A SNACK TO EAT
NEXT MORNING CHOP OFF HER HEAD  AND THEY CHOP IT OFF
AND ABOUT THIS TIME THEY WAS THROUGH WITH THE JOB AND WAS TAPERING OFF WITH A KIND OF GENERL GOOD-BYE CUSSING AND THEN THE OLD DOCTOR COMES AND TAKES A LOOK AND SAYS
HERE'S YOUR OPPOSITION LINE
BUT NOW I TOOK TO IT AGAIN BECAUSE PAP HADN'T NO OBJECTIONS
YOU OWDACIOUS PUPPY HE LOOKED KIND OF HURT AND SAYS
 HUCK YOU DON'T EVER SEEM TO WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT'S REGULAR
AND TWICE I SEEN LITTLE GANGS OF MEN GALLOP PAST THE LOG STORE WITH GUNS
 HE WAS THINKING ABOUT HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN AWAY UP YONDER AND HE WAS LOW AND HOMESICK
 WELL WE GOT TO SAVE HIM HAIN'T WE
THEN AS WE GOT FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY ALL THE TIME WE COULDN'T HARDLY HEAR THEM AT ALL
OH IT'S TOO TOO HARD THEN HE TURNS AROUND BLUBBERING AND MAKES A LOT OF IDIOTIC SIGNS TO THE DUKE ON HIS HANDS AND BLAMED IF HE DIDN'T DROP A CARPET-BAG AND BUST OUT A-CRYING
WE PLAYED ROBBER NOW AND THEN ABOUT A MONTH AND THEN I RESIGNED
BUT TOM SAID IT WARN'T BORROWING IT WAS STEALING
THE PITIFULEST THING OUT IS A MOB
 PEOPLE WOULD CALL ME A LOW-DOWN ABOLITIONIST AND DESPISE ME FOR KEEPING MUMBUT THAT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
 ONCE THERE WAS A THICK FOG AND THE RAFTS AND THINGS THAT WENT BY WAS BEATING TIN PANS SO THE STEAMBOATS WOULDN'T RUN OVER THEM
PRETTY SOON HE WAS ALL TIRED OUT AND DROPPED DOWN WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE DOOR AND SAID HE WOULD REST A MINUTE AND THEN KILL ME
FOR IT WAS LIKE BEING BORN AGAIN I WAS SO GLAD TO FIND OUT WHO I WAS
HUCKLEBERRY FINN SCENE
 WE SAID THERE WARN'T NO HOME LIKE A RAFT AFTER ALL
TOM POKED ABOUT AMONGST THE PASSAGES AND PRETTY SOON DUCKED UNDER A WALL WHERE YOU WOULDN'T A NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A HOLE
 SHORE'S YOU'RE BORN HE'LL TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE
 NOW ALL READY
BUT THAT AIN'T THE THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
AND AS I WAS SAYING THEY HAVEN'T GOT HERE IN TIME DID ANYBODY SEND EM WORD OH YES
 YOU SEE HE COME TO TOWN THE MORNING AFTER THE MURDER AND TOLD ABOUT IT AND WAS OUT WITH EM ON THE FERRYBOAT HUNT AND RIGHT AWAY AFTER HE UP AND LEFT

II'D DONE FORGOT IT
 AND THERE WAS A BOTTLE THAT HAD HAD MILK IN IT AND IT HAD A RAG STOPPER FOR A BABY TO SUCK
WHEN THE PLACE WAS PACKED FULL THE UNDERTAKER HE SLID AROUND IN HIS BLACK GLOVES WITH HIS SOFTY SOOTHERING WAYS PUTTING ON THE LAST TOUCHES AND GETTING PEOPLE AND THINGS ALL SHIP-SHAPE AND COMFORTABLE AND MAKING NO MORE SOUND THAN A CAT

 HE WAS HERE A MINUTE AGO YOU MEAN WHERE'S HUCK FINN_THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN

 IT AIN'T GOOD SENSE TO GO COURT'N AROUND AFTER A HALTER IF YOU CAN GIT AT WHAT YOU'RE UP TO IN SOME WAY THAT'S JIST AS GOOD AND AT THE SAME TIME DON'T BRING YOU INTO NO RESKS
 BUT I DIDN'T MIND BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE NOBODY JUST YETI ONLY WANTED TO GET THE LAY OF THE LAND

BECAUSE THE WIDOW SHE TOLD ME SO HER OWN SELF I DOAN K'YER WHAT DE WIDDER SAY HE WARN'T NO WISE MAN NUTHER
AND THE MINUTE I SAYS IT OUT CRAWLS THIS NIGGER FROM SOMEWHERES AND SAYS HE'LL HELP AND HE DONE IT TOO AND DONE IT VERY WELL
WELL BY THIS TIME I WAS MOST DOWN TO THE FOOT OF THE ISLAND
 I GOT DOWN THERE ALL OUT OF BREATH BUT LOADED UP WITH JOY AND SUNG OUT
EVERYBODY WAS ASLEEP
THEY HAD BORROWED A MELODEUMA SICK ONE
WE HAD A ROUGH TIME GETTING TO THE TOP THE SIDES WAS SO STEEP AND THE BUSHES SO THICK
KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE RATS
 WELL THE NIGHT GOT GRAY AND RUTHER THICK WHICH IS THE NEXT MEANEST THING TO FOG
IF GENTLEMEN KIN AFFORD TO PAY A DOLLAR A MILE APIECE TO BE TOOK ON AND PUT OFF IN A YAWL A STEAMBOAT KIN AFFORD TO CARRY EM CAN'T IT SO THEY SOFTENED DOWN AND SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT
BUT EVERY TIME YOU'S GWYNE TO GIT WELL AGIN
WELL DEN DIS IS DE WAY IT LOOK TO ME HUCK
 I DON'T SAY THAT OURN IS LAMBS BECAUSE THEY AIN'T WHEN YOU COME RIGHT DOWN TO THE COLD FACTS
 NOW AIN DAT SO BOSSAIN'T IT SO
 I'LL TAKE THE ORDER AND SEND IT ALONG WITH YOUR BROTHER'S AND THEN THEY'LL KNOW IT'S ALL RIGHT SO THEY GOT SOME PAPER AND A PEN AND THE KING HE SET DOWN AND TWISTED HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE AND CHAWED HIS TONGUE AND SCRAWLED OFF SOMETHING
 FIFTEEN FARMERS AND EVERY ONE OF THEM HAD A GUN
THE BRUTE
WE DIDN'T SEE NO SUCH MARK GOOD SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN
ASSISTED BY THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY
STEALING CATTLE AND SUCH THINGS AIN'T ROBBERY
 WE DIDN'T HAVE NO TROUBLE ABOUT SNAGS
 A GOOD MANY THINKS HE DONE IT
I KNOWED I WAS ALL RIGHT NOW
KASE HE SAY DEY AIN'T NO WITCHES
 IF I HAD TOM SAWYER'S HEAD I WOULDN'T TRADE IT OFF TO BE A DUKE NOR MATE OF A STEAMBOAT NOR CLOWN IN A CIRCUS NOR NOTHING I CAN THINK OF
SO I KNOW THE AVERAGE ALL AROUND
THE MORE I STUDIED ABOUT THIS THE MORE MY CONSCIENCE WENT TO GRINDING ME AND THE MORE WICKED AND LOW-DOWN AND ORNERY I GOT TO FEELING
CHAPTER IX
 I_I RUN OFF JIM BUT MIND YOU SAID YOU WOULDN TELLYOU KNOW YOU SAID YOU WOULDN TELL HUCK WELL I DID
I DIDN'T LOSE NO TIME
 BUT PRETTY SOON THEY SEE THAT LONG-LEGGED UNDERTAKER MAKE A SIGN TO THE PREACHER AS MUCH AS TO SAY DON'T YOU WORRYJUST DEPEND ON ME  THEN HE STOOPED DOWN AND BEGUN TO GLIDE ALONG THE WALL JUST HIS SHOULDERS SHOWING OVER THE PEOPLE'S HEADS
 THE FROCKS WAS HUNG ALONG THE WALL AND BEFORE THEM WAS A CURTAIN MADE OUT OF CALICO THAT HUNG DOWN TO THE FLOOR
 TOM SAYS IT WASN'T ENOUGH
BUT THESE ARE THE ONES THAT PETER WAS THICKEST WITH AND USED TO WRITE ABOUT SOMETIMES WHEN HE WROTE HOME
HE STORMED RIGHT ALONG AND SAID ANY MAN THAT PRETENDED TO BE AN ENGLISHMAN AND COULDN'T IMITATE THE LINGO NO BETTER THAN WHAT HE DID WAS A FRAUD AND A LIAR
WHO'S THAT
WHATREGULAR YESREGULAR
BUT WHEN I GLIMPSED HIM IN THE LIGHTNING MY HEART SHOT UP IN MY MOUTH AND I WENT OVERBOARD BACKWARDS
HE WAS ALWAYS JUST THAT PARTICULAR
 I NEVER HEARD THE BEAT OF IT
 HE RAISED UP AND BLINKED HIS EYES AROUND AND SAYS
AND I SAYS ALL RIGHT THAT SUITS ME BUT I AIN'T GOT NO MONEY FOR TO BUY THE OUTFIT AND I RECKON I COULDN'T GET NONE FROM HOME BECAUSE IT'S LIKELY PAP'S BEEN BACK BEFORE NOW AND GOT IT ALL AWAY FROM JUDGE THATCHER AND DRUNK IT UP
EVERYTHING WAS DEAD QUIET AND IT LOOKED LATE AND SMELT LATE
 THE DUKE HE FRETTED AND SWEATED AROUND AND WAS IN A MIGHTY SOUR WAY
THERE AIN'T NOTHING IN IT
JIM WAS FOR PUTTING OUR TRAPS IN THERE RIGHT AWAY BUT I SAID WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE CLIMBING UP AND DOWN THERE ALL THE TIME
 I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE THEM NOR YOUR SISTERS NOR NOBODY IN THIS TOWN
HANDS OFFTHEY'RE COLD
AND PAP HE ALWAYS SAID IT TOO THOUGH HE WARN'T NO MORE QUALITY THAN A MUDCAT HIMSELF
AND BY AND BY I FOUND HIM ROOSTING ON THE BITTS FORWARD WITH HIS HEAD DOWN BETWEEN HIS KNEES
 THESE SPARKS WAS OUR CLOCKTHE FIRST ONE THAT SHOWED AGAIN MEANT MORNING WAS COMING SO WE HUNTED A PLACE TO HIDE AND TIE UP RIGHT AWAY
I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HIM
THROW STIFF-ARMED FROM THE SHOULDER LIKE THERE WAS A PIVOT THERE FOR IT TO TURN ON LIKE A GIRL
 HE SAYS TO BOGGS MIGHTY CA'M AND SLOWHE SAYS
 HE WENT A MOONING AROUND FIRST TO ONE RAT-HOLE AND THEN ANOTHER TILL HE'D BEEN TO THEM ALL
 HE TOLD ME TO WATCH OUT SHARP AND LET HIM KNOW WHEN THE MEN COME IN SIGHT AGAIN
EN IT'S COME TRUE
 BUT I SAID COME ON IF WE GET LEFT ON THIS WRECK WE ARE IN A FIX SURE
 WHY BULLY IT BEATS THE NONESUCH DON'T IT THE DUKE ALLOWED IT DID
 TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT NOW THAT'S A GOOD BOY SO I SAID IT WOULDN'T BE NO USE TO TRY TO PLAY IT ANY LONGER AND I WOULD JUST MAKE A CLEAN BREAST AND TELL HER EVERYTHING BUT SHE MUSN'T GO BACK ON HER PROMISE
NOT THESE IMPAIRED THE SACRED NAME    OF STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS
 THEM'S THE VERY WORDS I SAID
 DON'T EVER TELL ME ANY MORE THAT A NIGGER AIN'T GOT ANY HISTRIONIC TALENT
SO WE TIED UP ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE ABOVE IT IN THE MOUTH OF A CRICK WHICH WAS SHUT IN LIKE A TUNNEL BY THE CYPRESS TREES AND ALL OF US BUT JIM TOOK THE CANOE AND WENT DOWN THERE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY CHANCE IN THAT PLACE FOR OUR SHOW
SO I SEEN EASY ENOUGH THAT THEY'D SHOVED IN THERE TO DO UP YOUR MAJESTY'S ROOM OR SOMETHING S'POSING YOU WAS UP
IT'S A LIE JIM TURNER
 I WENT INTO DE WOODS EN JEDGED I WOULDN FOOL WID RAFFS NO MO LONG AS DEY MOVE DE LANTERN ROUN SO
 NOW THE THING FOR YOU TO DO IS TO DROOP YOUR TAILS AND GO HOME AND CRAWL IN A HOLE
 SAYS I ME-YOW
 THEN THE KING LL GET IT AGAIN AND IT LL BE A LONG DAY BEFORE HE GIVES ANYBODY ANOTHER CHANCE TO SMOUCH IT FROM HIM
 I HEARD THE WHOOP AGAIN
 THEY HAIN'T GOT IT WHY WHO'S GOT IT I WISH I KNOWED BUT I DON'T
 THIS SHOOK ME UP CONSIDERABLE BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE WIDOW'S ANY MORE AND BE SO CRAMPED UP AND SIVILIZED AS THEY CALLED IT
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANI DON'T KNOW THE WORDS TO PUT IT IN
 THEY BOTH GOT POWERFUL MELLOW BUT I NOTICED THE KING DIDN'T GET MELLOW ENOUGH TO FORGET TO REMEMBER TO NOT DENY ABOUT HIDING THE MONEY-BAG AGAIN
NOT NOW
 LOOK YONDER!UP THE ROAD!AIN'T THAT SOMEBODY COMING HE SPRUNG TO THE WINDOW AT THE HEAD OF THE BED AND THAT GIVE MRS PHELPS THE CHANCE SHE WANTED
HE SAID TWENTY MILE MORE WARN'T FAR FOR THE RAFT TO GO BUT HE WISHED WE WAS ALREADY THERE
 TOM SAWYER HE SAYS THE SAME
AND THE NEXT MINUTE HE SPRUNG UP AND DROPPED THE BRIDLE AND STOOD
AND I JUDGED I OUGHT TO TOLD HER FATHER ABOUT THAT PAPER AND THE CURIOUS WAY SHE ACTED AND THEN MAYBE HE WOULD A LOCKED HER UP AND THIS AWFUL MESS WOULDN'T EVER HAPPENED
 I LIKED ALL THAT FAMILY DEAD ONES AND ALL AND WARN'T GOING TO LET ANYTHING COME BETWEEN US
 WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO THE COLD FACTS WE SIMPLY GOT TO LET ON THAT A LANTERN'S RESKY
WHENEVER I GOT UNCOMMON TIRED I PLAYED HOOKEY AND THE HIDING I GOT NEXT DAY DONE ME GOOD AND CHEERED ME UP
 I'S GWYNE TO SET DOWN HERE AND LISTEN TELL I HEARS IT AGIN SO HE SET DOWN ON THE GROUND BETWIXT ME AND TOM
WELL WHEN THEY WAS ALL GONE THE KING HE ASKS MARY JANE HOW THEY WAS OFF FOR SPARE ROOMS AND SHE SAID SHE HAD ONE SPARE ROOM WHICH WOULD DO FOR UNCLE WILLIAM AND SHE'D GIVE HER OWN ROOM TO UNCLE HARVEY WHICH WAS A LITTLE BIGGER AND SHE WOULD TURN INTO THE ROOM WITH HER SISTERS AND SLEEP ON A COT
GO FOR HIS DAUGHTER!QUICK GO FOR HIS DAUGHTER
SHE WARN'T PARTICULAR
 W'Y WHAT HAS YOU LIVED ON
IT AIN'T NO USE IT CAN'T BE DONE
AND HERE WAS AUNTY PEGGING AWAY AT THE QUESTIONS AND ME A-SHAKING ALL OVER AND READY TO SINK DOWN IN MY TRACKS I WAS THAT SCARED
 I KNOW YOU CLEAR THROUGH
 WOULDN'T THAT PLAN WORK WORK
 WE CAN SPARE IT OH SHUCKS YES WE CAN SPARE IT
 THEM'S THE VERY WORDS
 THERE WAS A POWER OF STYLE ABOUT HER
YOU MUST A MET HIM ON THE ROAD DIDN'T YOU?OLDISH MAN WITH A NO I DIDN'T SEE NOBODY AUNT SALLY
THE FUNERAL.SATISFYING CURIOSITY.SUSPICIOUS OF HUCK,QUICK SALES AND SMALL
 AND IF YOU HEAR ANY DIGGING GOING ON NIGHTS IT'S US
AND BESIDES HE SAID HE MIGHT COME AND HA'NT US
PO LITTLE JOHNNY
 FULL OF PRINCIPLE
THE NEW OLD GENTLEMAN TURNS BRISK TOWARDS AB TURNER AND HIS PARD AND HIS EYE LIGHTS UP LIKE HE JUDGED HE'D GOT THE KING THIS TIME AND SAYS
BUT I KNOWED BETTER
THEN LIST WITH TEARFUL EYE    WHILST I HIS FATE DO TELL
HIS SOUL DID FROM THIS COLD WORLD FLY    BY FALLING DOWN A WELL
BUT SOMEBODY STOLE DE WOOD-FLAT DAT NIGHT EN NEX DAY DE ONE-LAIGGED NIGGER SAY DE BANK'S BUSTED
 SHE WAS MIGHTY RED IN THE FACE FOR A MINUTE AND HER EYES LIGHTED UP AND IT MADE HER POWERFUL PRETTY
WE GOT AN OLD TIN LANTERN AND A BUTCHER-KNIFE WITHOUT ANY HANDLE AND A BRAN-NEW BARLOW KNIFE WORTH TWO BITS IN ANY STORE AND A LOT OF TALLOW CANDLES AND A TIN CANDLESTICK AND A GOURD AND A TIN CUP AND A RATTY OLD BEDQUILT OFF THE BED AND A RETICULE WITH NEEDLES AND PINS AND BEESWAX AND BUTTONS AND THREAD AND ALL SUCH TRUCK IN IT AND A HATCHET AND SOME NAILS AND A FISHLINE AS THICK AS MY LITTLE FINGER WITH SOME MONSTROUS HOOKS ON IT AND A ROLL OF BUCKSKIN AND A LEATHER DOG-COLLAR AND A HORSESHOE AND SOME VIALS OF MEDICINE THAT DIDN'T HAVE NO LABEL ON THEM
BUT HE'S MISSED SEEING HIS BROTHER PETER DIEWHICH HE MAYN'T MIND NOBODY CAN TELL AS TO THATBUT HIS BROTHER WOULD A GIVE ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD TO SEE HIM BEFORE HE DIED
 AND YOU WON'T GO
 OH LET A POOR DEVIL ALONE THEN HE WENT DOWN ON ALL FOURS AND CRAWLED OFF BEGGING THEM TO LET HIM ALONE AND HE ROLLED HIMSELF UP IN HIS BLANKET AND WALLOWED IN UNDER THE OLD PINE TABLE STILL A-BEGGING
 I DID
GIMME A CHAW V TOBACKER HANK CAIN'T
 I DIDN'T KNOW HOW I WAS GOING TO SET STILL
 HE SLAPS THE DUKE ON THE SHOULDER AND SAYS
 I WISH THE BOTTOM OF THIS FORTRESS WAS SOLID ROCK JIM DON'T KNOW NOBODY IN CHINA WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT
 THEY ALWAYS TAKE ADVANTAGE MISS CHARLOTTE SHE HELD HER HEAD UP LIKE A QUEEN WHILE BUCK WAS TELLING HIS TALE AND HER NOSTRILS SPREAD AND HER EYES SNAPPED
 WE BLOWED OUT A CYLINDER-HEAD GOOD GRACIOUS
DON'T YOU GIVE ME NONE O YOUR LIP SAYS HE
 I'LL LAY FOR YOU MY SMARTY
THEY TOOK BOGGS TO A LITTLE DRUG STORE THE CROWD PRESSING AROUND JUST THE SAME AND THE WHOLE TOWN FOLLOWING AND I RUSHED AND GOT A GOOD PLACE AT THE WINDOW WHERE I WAS CLOSE TO HIM AND COULD SEE IN
AND HE WAS PAINTED ALL OVER RING-STREAKED-AND-STRIPED ALL SORTS OF COLORS AS SPLENDID AS A RAINBOW
 I SAID I BELIEVED MY UNCLE ABNER MOORE WOULD TAKE CARE OF ME AND SO THAT WAS WHY I STRUCK OUT FOR THIS TOWN OF GOSHEN
SHE DRUTHER DIE FIRST
 THEN IN ANOTHER VILLAGE THEY STARTED A DANCING-SCHOOL
AND BEFORE A BODY COULD THINK SHE GRABBED ME AND GIVE ME A SQUEEZE AND SAID I WAS THE BEST BOY IN THE WORLD AND NOT TO TELL ANYBODY
 "BOOM I SEE THE WHITE SMOKE SQUIRT OUT OF THE FERRYBOAT'S SIDE
PRETTY SOON I HEARS IT AGAIN
SO THE NEXT DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL ALONG ABOUT NOON-TIME THE GIRLS JOY GOT THE FIRST JOLT
 THERE WAS A WOMAN ABOUT FORTY YEAR OLD IN THERE KNITTING BY A CANDLE THAT WAS ON A PINE TABLE
 BUT I NEVER SAID SO BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY MAKE TROUBLE AND WOULDN'T DO NO GOOD
IT WOULD BE MOST AN HOUR YET TILL BREAKFAST SO WE LEFT AND STRUCK DOWN INTO THE WOODS
HEAVE HER HEAD TO STABBOARD  I HEARD THAT JUST AS PLAIN AS IF THE MAN WAS BY MY SIDE
 _WHO SUNG OUT
 THERE'ROYAL NONESUCH BRICKSVILLE  PUT IT AWAY AND DON'T LOSE IT
AND IT WARN'T NO USE TO TELL JIM SO I DIDN'T TELL HIM
THEY GOT TO THE WOODPILE THAT WAS IN FRONT OF MY TREE AND SLIPPED IN BEHIND IT AND SO THEY HAD THE BULGE ON THE MEN AGAIN
WE DIDN'T SAY A WORD FOR A GOOD WHILE
I'M TIRED OF THIS BUT I'LL ENDURE IT TILL ONE O'CLOCK
 HE GRABBED HIS GUN AND RODE STRAIGHT TO THE PLACE WHERE WE WAS HID
 POOR THING MANY'S THE TIME I MADE MYSELF GO UP TO THE LITTLE ROOM THAT USED TO BE HERS AND GET OUT HER POOR OLD SCRAP-BOOK AND READ IN IT WHEN HER PICTURES HAD BEEN AGGRAVATING ME AND I HAD SOURED ON HER A LITTLE
 I'LL BE ALONG IN A MINUTE HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND I CLEARED OUT UP THE RIVER-BANK
 SO HE GLIDED ALONG AND THE POWWOW AND RACKET GETTING MORE AND MORE OUTRAGEOUS ALL THE TIME
AND IF THEY WARN'T FOOLS THEY'D SLEEP IN YOUR HAIR SILAS_YOU'D NEVER FIND IT OUT
HOUSE TO ROB YOU MEAN SAYS I TO MYSELF

 SO I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AGAIN
AFEARD TO COME OUT WELL HE SAYS YOU NEEDN'T BE AFEARD NO MORE BECUZ THEY'VE GOT HIM
 AND YOU COULD HEAR HER WHOOP TO JERICHO
 WHEN WE WAS READY TO SHOVE OFF WE WAS A QUARTER OF A MILE BELOW THE ISLAND AND IT WAS PRETTY BROAD DAY
 I WISHED I WAS OUT OF THAT TREE BUT I DASN'T COME DOWN
THE WIDOW SAID I WAS COMING ALONG SLOW BUT SURE AND DOING VERY SATISFACTORY
 SO I WENT TO STUDYING IT OUT
 BUT THE KING SAYS
 WHEN I STRUCK THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND I NEVER WAITED TO BLOW THOUGH I WAS MOST WINDED BUT I SHOVED RIGHT INTO THE TIMBER WHERE MY OLD CAMP USED TO BE AND STARTED A GOOD FIRE THERE ON A HIGH AND DRY SPOT
AND SAID THAT AFTER SHE'D ABOUT COUNTED HER HEAD OFF FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS HE JUDGED SHE'D GIVE IT UP AND OFFER TO KILL ANYBODY THAT WANTED HER TO EVER COUNT THEM ANY MORE
 WE WAS IN RUTHER TOO MUCH OF A SWEAT TO THINK OF SO MANY THINGS

 HE SCOLDED US FOR EVERYTHING AND WE COULDN'T SEEM TO DO NOTHING RIGHT
 SO I SLIPS TO THE SICK-ROOM AND IF I FOUND HIM AWAKE I RECKONED WE COULD PUT UP A YARN FOR THE FAMILY THAT WOULD WASH
 DON'T YOU KNOW NOTHING WELL I DON'T WANT TO KNOW NO SUCH FOOLISHNESS AS THAT
BUT DOG MY CATS EF IT AIN'T DE POWERFULLEST DREAM I EVER SEE

 THE MEN BROUGHT THEIR GUNS WITH THEM

 EVERYBODY SINGS OUT SOLD AND ROSE UP MAD AND WAS A-GOING FOR THAT STAGE AND THEM TRAGEDIANS

 I GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH AND YOU WANT TO BRACE UP MISS MARY BECAUSE IT'S A BAD KIND AND GOING TO BE HARD TO TAKE BUT THERE AIN'T NO HELP FOR IT
I BELIEVE IT'S SOAND IF IT AIN'T SO THERE'S A HEAP STRONGER RESEMBLANCE THAN I'D NOTICED BEFORE ANYWAY
FOR WHO FETCHED ME SO LOW WHEN I WAS SO HIGH
 BY AND BY HE SAYS
 BY AND BY HE SAYS
 WE BUSTED IT UP AND CHASED THE CHILDREN UP THE HOLLOW
BUT LOOKY HERE HUCK WHO WUZ IT DAT UZ KILLED IN DAT SHANTY EF IT WARN'T YOU THEN I TOLD HIM THE WHOLE THING AND HE SAID IT WAS SMART

BUT ALL OF US WAS SAVED BUT BILL WHIPPLEAND OH HE WAS THE BEST CRETUR!I MOST WISH T IT HAD BEEN ME I DO MY GEORGE
AND BY AND BY WHEN I'M AWAY DOWN THE RIVER I'LL WRITE A LETTER AND TELL MARY JANE WHERE IT'S HID

AND I HEARD AN OWL AWAY OFF WHO-WHOOING ABOUT SOMEBODY THAT WAS DEAD AND A WHIPPOWILL AND A DOG CRYING ABOUT SOMEBODY THAT WAS GOING TO DIE
 I WARN'T EVER MURDERED AT ALLI PLAYED IT ON THEM
 THE WAVES MOST WASHED ME OFF THE RAFT SOMETIMES BUT I HADN'T ANY CLOTHES ON AND DIDN'T MIND
 SHALL I GO PRIVATE AND TELL MARY JANE

WE'LL TRY AND GET EM TO SEND FOR YOU WHICH MADE THEM ALL LAUGH AND THEY SAID IT WAS A PRIME GOOD HIT
 WHY HOW YOU TALK

 I'M ONLY A BOY LOOK HERE IF YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAIDNOBODY'LL HURT YOU
NEVER MIND ABOUT THEM
AND THEN THEY SHOOK HANDS WITH THE DUKE AND DIDN'T SAY NOTHING BUT JUST KEPT A-SMILING AND BOBBING THEIR HEADS LIKE A PASSEL OF SAPHEADS WHILST HE MADE ALL SORTS OF SIGNS WITH HIS HANDS AND SAID GOO-GOOGOO-GOO-GOO ALL THE TIME LIKE A BABY THAT CAN'T TALK
 THE SEEGARS WAS PRIME
HUCK FINN I FELT GOOD AND ALL WASHED CLEAN OF SIN FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER FELT SO IN MY LIFE AND I KNOWED I COULD PRAY NOW

 I'M UNFAVORABLE TO KILLIN A MAN AS LONG AS YOU CAN GIT AROUN IT
 THERE'S HOBSON THE BABTIS PREACHER
GOES THE FIRST SHOT AND HE STAGGERS BACK CLAWING AT THE AIRBANG
 HE'S A RUNAWAY NIGGER AND THEY'VE GOT HIM

EN TRASH IS WHAT PEOPLE IS DAT PUTS DIRT ON DE HEAD ER DEY FREN'S EN MAKES EM ASHAMED THEN HE GOT UP SLOW AND WALKED TO THE WIGWAM AND WENT IN THERE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING BUT THAT
 I'D SEEN ALL I WANTED TO OF THEM AND WANTED TO GET ENTIRELY SHUT OF THEM
 YOU FLOAT ALONG DOWN ABOUT TWENTY MILES AND YOU'LL COME TO A TOWN ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE RIVER
 OH THEY'RE HERE
 THEY DRESSED IN WHITE LINEN FROM HEAD TO FOOT LIKE THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND WORE BROAD PANAMA HATS
 WHILE I WAS COOKING SUPPER THE OLD MAN TOOK A SWIG OR TWO AND GOT SORT OF WARMED UP AND WENT TO RIPPING AGAIN
COME BLACK WITH SIN
 WHY COULDN'T YOU SAID THAT BEFORE
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS TIT-TAT-TOE THREE-IN-A-ROW AND AS EASY AS PLAYING HOOKY
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT
EVERYBODY THAT COULD GET A CHANCE AT HIM TRIED THEIR BEST TO COAX HIM OFF OF HIS HORSE SO THEY COULD LOCK HIM UP AND GET HIM SOBER
HE MUST SHOVE RIGHT OVER TO TOWN AND SELL
 IF I SEE A STUMP I TOOK IT FOR A MAN
I RECKONED THE POOR KING WAS IN FOR A GAUDY TIME OF IT WITH THE AUDIENCE BUT NOTHING OF THE SORT
BUT MAYBE IT WAS LUCKIER I DIDN'T
 I FELT AWFUL BAD TO SEE IT
 I TRIED TO BUT THE WORDS WOULDN'T COME
SO I DONE IT
 BUT I DIDN'T DO IT PRETTY GOOD AND WHEN I GOT DONE I SEE SHE WARN'T SATISFIED
 I JUDGED HE WOULDN'T COME BACK THAT NIGHT
 YOU GOT ANY RATS AROUND HERE NO SAH I HAIN'T SEED NONE WELL WE'LL GET YOU SOME RATS WHY MARS TOM I DOAN WANT NO RATS
 BUT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY SPYING AROUND THAT GIVES NOTICE TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE CASTLE
 STRIKE A LIGHT THERE SOMEBODY

SO WE PITCHED IT IN AND IT DIDN'T WAKE HIM
WELL YOU JUST OWN UP FIRST THAT YOU DID HIDE THAT MONEY THERE INTENDING TO GIVE ME THE SLIP ONE OF THESE DAYS AND COME BACK AND DIG IT UP AND HAVE IT ALL TO YOURSELF WAIT JEST A MINUTE DUKEANSWER ME THIS ONE QUESTION HONEST AND FAIR
AND HE SAID HE WOULD MORE PARTICULAR IF IT WAS DARK BECAUSE THE WITCHES WENT FOR HIM MOSTLY IN THE DARK AND IT WAS GOOD TO HAVE FOLKS AROUND THEN
SOME OF THEM KINDS OF LOAFERS NEVER HAS A CENT IN THE WORLD NOR A CHAW OF TOBACCO OF THEIR OWN
LAY YOUR HAND ON THIS BOOK AND SAY IT I SEE IT WARN'T NOTHING BUT A DICTIONARY SO I LAID MY HAND ON IT AND SAID IT

THREE LITTLE LOG NIGGER-CABINS IN A ROW T'OTHER SIDE THE SMOKE-HOUSE
THE DOOR AIN'T GOING TO BE LOCKED TOM AND THERE'S THE WINDOW AND THE ROD
 THE KING HE READS IT AND PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET AND SAYS
IT WAS AWFUL THOUGHTS AND AWFUL WORDS BUT THEY WAS SAID
 IT WAS ACCORDING TO THE OLD SAYING GIVE A NIGGER AN INCH AND HE'LL TAKE AN ELL  THINKS I THIS IS WHAT COMES OF MY NOT THINKING
 IT ITCHED TILL THE TEARS COME INTO MY EYES
SO I SLID OUT AND SLIPPED OFF UP THE ROAD AND THERE WARN'T ANYBODY AT THE CHURCH EXCEPT MAYBE A HOG OR TWO FOR THERE WARN'T ANY LOCK ON THE DOOR AND HOGS LIKES A PUNCHEON FLOOR IN SUMMER-TIME BECAUSE IT'S COOL
THE KING SAID THE CUBBY WOULD DO FOR HIS VALLEYMEANING ME
 DID YOU SPECULATE ANY MORE YES
 I WENT TO LOOKING OUT SHARP FOR A LIGHT AND SORT OF SINGING TO MYSELF
 SO I JUST TOOK A LOOK AND SHOVED ALONG STRAIGHT FOR TOWN
 I RECKONED IF SHE KNOWED ME SHE'D TAKE A JOB THAT WAS MORE NEARER HER SIZE
WE COULD HAVE A CHANGE ANYWAYAND MAYBE A CHANCE FOR THE CHANGE ON TOP OF IT
 A WISE MAN UD TAKE EN BUIL A BILER-FACTRY
ARE YOU ENGLISH TOO I SAYS YES
 WHAT'S YOUR LAY I'VE DONE CONSIDERBLE IN THE DOCTORING WAY IN MY TIME
 BUT NOTHING COME OF IT
I WONDER IF UNCLE SILAS IS GOING TO HANG THIS NIGGER
SAYS I TO MYSELF I CAN EXPLAIN BETTER HOW WE COME TO NOT BE IN THAT ROOM THIS MORNING IF I GO OUT TO ONE SIDE AND STUDY OVER IT A LITTLE
AND WHEN WE GOT THE WORD WE RUSHED OUT OF THE WOODS AND DOWN THE HILL
 PRETTY SOON I FOUND A MAN OUT IN THE RIVER WITH A SKIFF SETTING A TROT-LINE
 NOW YOU GO ALONG OUT THERE AND LAY LOW TILL NINE OR HALF-PAST TO-NIGHT AND THEN GET THEM TO FETCH YOU HOME AGAINTELL THEM YOU'VE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING
 PRETTY SOON WE STRUCK THE FORWARD END OF THE SKYLIGHT AND CLUMB ON TO IT
 SO WE JUDGED WE COULD GET SOME OF THEM AGAIN
 ABOUT TWO DOZEN MEN FLOCKED DOWN WHEN THEY SEE THE YAWL A-COMING AND WHEN THE KING SAYS
 YOU MUST BE A BLAME FOOL WHAT TOWN IS IT MISTER IF YOU WANT TO KNOW GO AND FIND OUT
IS IT THEM?SINGING THE DOXOLOGER."AWFUL SQUAREFUNERAL ORGIES.A BAD INVESTMENT CHAPTER XXVI
THE NEIGHBORS SAID IT WAS THE DOCTOR FIRST THEN EMMELINE THEN THE UNDERTAKERTHE UNDERTAKER NEVER GOT IN AHEAD OF EMMELINE BUT ONCE AND THEN SHE HUNG FIRE ON A RHYME FOR THE DEAD PERSON'S NAME WHICH WAS WHISTLER
HOW'D YOU GET YOUR BREAKFAST SO EARLY ON THE BOAT IT WAS KINDER THIN ICE BUT I SAYS
SAY LOOKY HERE
 BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE MAN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARKAND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
SO NOW HE RAISED A HOWL THAT FAIRLY MADE A BODY'S HAIR RAISE AND DOWN HE WENT IN THE DIRT AND ROLLED THERE AND HELD HIS TOES
I SEE A LIGHT A-COMIN ROUN DE P'INT BYMEBY SO I WADE IN EN SHOVE A LOG AHEAD O ME EN SWUM MORE'N HALF WAY ACROST DE RIVER EN GOT IN MONGST DE DRIFT-WOOD EN KEP MY HEAD DOWN LOW EN KINDER SWUM AGIN DE CURRENT TELL DE RAFF COME ALONG
 IF THEY WANTED US TO CALL THEM KINGS AND DUKES I HADN'T NO OBJECTIONS LONG AS IT WOULD KEEP PEACE IN THE FAMILY
 THAT CUT BANK WAS AN ISLAND AND JIM HAD GONE DOWN T'OTHER SIDE OF IT
 TOM HAD HIS STORE CLOTHES ON AND AN AUDIENCEAND THAT WAS ALWAYS NUTS FOR TOM SAWYER
I'D BETTER LAY LOW AND KEEP DARK AND NOT WRITE AT ALL
 PRETTY SOON TOM SAYS
MIGHTY SOON WE'LL HAVE THE CAVE SO CLUTTERED UP WITH WOMEN AND FELLOWS WAITING TO BE RANSOMED THAT THERE WON'T BE NO PLACE FOR THE ROBBERS
I HEARD WHAT THEY SAID TOOEVERY WORD OF IT

 SPECIALLY SEEING WE GOT IT SO EASY_GIVEN BACK TO US FLUNG AT OUR HEADS AS YOU MAY SAY WHEN OF COURSE WE ALLOWED TO HAVE TO STEAL IT BACK
THEN THEY JAILED HIM AND NEXT DAY THEY HAD HIM BEFORE COURT AND JAILED HIM AGAIN FOR A WEEK
OBSEQUIES AIN'T USED IN ENGLAND NO MORE NOWIT'S GONE OUT
 I PADDLED OVER TO THE ILLINOIS SHORE AND DRIFTED DOWN MOST A HALF A MILE DOING IT
WONDER WHO HE'S A-GWYNE TO CHAW UP THIS TIME
EVERYBODY THAT WANTS TO JOIN HAS GOT TO TAKE AN OATH AND WRITE HIS NAME IN BLOOD EVERYBODY WAS WILLING
 YES YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
 I WHOOPED AND LISTENED
BEKASE WHY
 I STOOD ON THE BANK AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE RIVER
 SO HE LOCKED ME IN AND TOOK THE SKIFF AND STARTED OFF TOWING THE RAFT ABOUT HALF-PAST THREE
MAN THE SWEEPS AND SET HER LOOSE
THEY GRIPPED US ALL AND MARCHED US RIGHT ALONG STRAIGHT FOR THE GRAVEYARD WHICH WAS A MILE AND A HALF DOWN THE RIVER AND THE WHOLE TOWN AT OUR HEELS FOR WE MADE NOISE ENOUGH AND IT WAS ONLY NINE IN THE EVENING
 I SHOT PAST THE HEAD AT A RIPPING RATE THE CURRENT WAS SO SWIFT AND THEN I GOT INTO THE DEAD WATER AND LANDED ON THE SIDE TOWARDS THE ILLINOIS SHORE
 YES SHE SAID SAY SHE HAS RUN OVER FOR TO ASK THE APTHORPS TO BE SURE AND COME TO THE AUCTION AND BUY THIS HOUSE BECAUSE SHE ALLOWED HER UNCLE PETER WOULD RUTHER THEY HAD IT THAN ANYBODY ELSE
PHELPS WAS ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONE-HORSE COTTON PLANTATIONS AND THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE
BECAUSE NOW IF I COULD TIP HER THE WINK SHE'D LIGHT OUT AND SAVE ME AND BLOW ON OUR DEAD-BEATS
 THEY MADE THE KING TELL HIS YARN AND THEY MADE THE OLD GENTLEMAN TELL HIS'N
AND ONE OF YOU GIRLS GO AND WAKE UP BUCK AND TELL HIMOH HERE HE IS HIMSELF
WELL FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN I DONE IT
THE WHOOPING WENT ON AND IN ABOUT A MINUTE I COME A-BOOMING DOWN ON A CUT BANK WITH SMOKY GHOSTS OF BIG TREES ON IT AND THE CURRENT THROWED ME OFF TO THE LEFT AND SHOT BY AMONGST A LOT OF SNAGS THAT FAIRLY ROARED THE CURRRENT WAS TEARING BY THEM SO SWIFT
 WHAT HAS BECOME OF THAT BOY I SEE MY CHANCE
 WHY THAT AIN'T TOM IT'S SID
 I WOULDN LAY DE WEIGHT ER MY FINGER ON UM NOT F'R TEN HUND'D THOUS'N BILLION DOLLARS I WOULDN'T CHAPTER XXXVII
 NOW YOU WORK YOUR MIND AND STUDY OUT A PLAN TO STEAL JIM AND I WILL STUDY OUT ONE TOO
 ANOTHER TIME THEY TRIED TO GO AT YELLOCUTION
 LAWSY I'S MIGHTY GLAD TO GIT YOU BACK AGAIN HONEY I SAYS
 WE WAS OUT OF COFFEE SO JIM SAID I BETTER GO ALONG WITH THEM IN THE CANOE AND GET SOME
BECAUSE HE HADN'T EVER BEEN AWAY FROM HOME BEFORE IN HIS LIFE
THEN HE WOULD HOIST UP HIS EYEBROWS
 SO I TOLD THE FOLKS I RECKONED I WOULD GO UP TO THE TOWN AND FETCH DOWN MY BAGGAGE
 I RECK'N I KNOWS WHAT I KNOWS
 GO LONG WITH YOU NOW AND DO AS YOUR MOTHER TOLD YOU WHEN WE GOT UP-STAIRS TO HIS ROOM HE GOT ME A COARSE SHIRT AND A ROUNDABOUT AND PANTS OF HIS AND I PUT THEM ON
THEN I TIED UP THE RIP IN THE MEAL SACK WITH A STRING SO IT WOULDN'T LEAK NO MORE AND TOOK IT AND MY SAW TO THE CANOE AGAIN
 THEY LET ON TO BE SORRY THEY WAS GOING OUT OF THIS REGION
 THEN HE TOOK HIS PLACE OVER AGAINST THE WALL
 "LETTING ON DON'T COST NOTHING
 WE'LL SEND YOU SOME THINGS BY THEM I SAID DON'T DO NOTHING OF THE KIND
IT HAD CLOUDED UP PRETTY DARK JUST AFTER I GOT ON TO THE RAFT BUT IT WAS CLEARING UP AGAIN NOW
 THEY'VE GOT TO WALTZ THAT PALACE AROUND OVER THE COUNTRY WHEREVER YOU WANT IT YOU UNDERSTAND WELL SAYS I I THINK THEY ARE A PACK OF FLAT-HEADS FOR NOT KEEPING THE PALACE THEMSELVES STEAD OF FOOLING THEM AWAY LIKE THAT

CHAPTER XXVIII
CHAPTER XXVIII
 IT WARN'T BUT A MIGHTY LITTLE WAYS TO THE RAFT NOW
THERE WARN'T NOTHING TO DO BUT JUST HOLD STILL AND TRY AND BE READY TO STAND FROM UNDER WHEN THE LIGHTNING STRUCK
TRAMPTRAMPTRAMP
TRAMPTRAMPTRAMP
WHY THERE AIN'T NO NECESSITY FOR IT
AND HE SAID WHAT HE HAD PLANNED IN HIS HEAD FROM THE START IF WE GOT JIM OUT ALL SAFE WAS FOR US TO RUN HIM DOWN THE RIVER ON THE RAFT AND HAVE ADVENTURES PLUMB TO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER AND THEN TELL HIM ABOUT HIS BEING FREE AND TAKE HIM BACK UP HOME ON A STEAMBOAT IN STYLE AND PAY HIM FOR HIS LOST TIME AND WRITE WORD AHEAD AND GET OUT ALL THE NIGGERS AROUND AND HAVE THEM WALTZ HIM INTO TOWN WITH A TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION AND A BRASS-BAND AND THEN HE WOULD BE A HERO AND SO WOULD WE
HOW DOES THAT STRIKE YOU I'M IN UP TO THE HUB FOR ANYTHING THAT WILL PAY BILGEWATER
 I WENT IN THERE AND SAYS
THEY COME OUT TO SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
WE WAS FEELING PRETTY GOOD AFTER BREAKFAST AND TOOK MY CANOE AND WENT OVER THE RIVER A-FISHING WITH A LUNCH AND HAD A GOOD TIME AND TOOK A LOOK AT THE RAFT AND FOUND HER ALL RIGHT AND GOT HOME LATE TO SUPPER AND FOUND THEM IN SUCH A SWEAT AND WORRY THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHICH END THEY WAS STANDING ON AND MADE US GO RIGHT OFF TO BED THE MINUTE WE WAS DONE SUPPER AND WOULDN'T TELL US WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS AND NEVER LET ON A WORD ABOUT THE NEW LETTER BUT DIDN'T NEED TO BECAUSE WE KNOWED AS MUCH ABOUT IT AS ANYBODY DID AND AS SOON AS WE WAS HALF UP STAIRS AND HER BACK WAS TURNED WE SLID FOR THE CELLAR CUPBOARD AND LOADED UP A GOOD LUNCH AND TOOK IT UP TO OUR ROOM AND WENT TO BED AND GOT UP ABOUT HALF-PAST ELEVEN AND TOM PUT ON AUNT SALLY'S DRESS THAT HE STOLE AND WAS GOING TO START WITH THE LUNCH BUT SAYS
 BUT ANSWER ME ONLY JEST THIS ONE MORENOW DON'T GIT MAD
 OF COURSE THERE WAS A BOOMING CURRENT
 YOU GIT ME THAT MONEY TO-MORROWI WANT IT I HAIN'T GOT NO MONEY IT'S A LIE
 DON'T YOU KNOW ABOUT THE HAREM
 THE DUKE HE BEGUN TO ABUSE HIM FOR AN OLD FOOL AND THE KING BEGUN TO SASS BACK AND THE MINUTE THEY WAS FAIRLY AT IT I LIT OUT AND SHOOK THE REEFS OUT OF MY HIND LEGS AND SPUN DOWN THE RIVER ROAD LIKE A DEER FOR I SEE OUR CHANCE
 I TOOK NOTICE AND DONE BETTER
 BY AND BY SOMEBODY SAYS
 AND ABOVE ALL DON'T YOU HANDLE THE WITCH-THINGS HANNEL M MARS SID
THE CANDLE WAS ON THE FLOOR AND THERE THEY ALL WAS LOOKING AT ME AND ME AT THEM FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MINUTE
 ONE LONG LANKY MAN WITH LONG HAIR AND A BIG WHITE FUR STOVEPIPE HAT ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND A CROOKED-HANDLED CANE MARKED OUT THE PLACES ON THE GROUND WHERE BOGGS STOOD AND WHERE SHERBURN STOOD AND THE PEOPLE FOLLOWING HIM AROUND FROM ONE PLACE TO T'OTHER AND WATCHING EVERYTHING HE DONE AND BOBBING THEIR HEADS TO SHOW THEY UNDERSTOOD AND STOOPING A LITTLE AND RESTING THEIR HANDS ON THEIR THIGHS TO WATCH HIM MARK THE PLACES ON THE GROUND WITH HIS CANE
 HE HAD HOUSES AND LAND AND IT'S RECKONED HE LEFT THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND IN CASH HID UP SOM'ERS WHEN DID YOU SAY HE DIED I DIDN'T SAY BUT IT WAS LAST NIGHT FUNERAL TO-MORROW LIKELY YES BOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WELL IT'S ALL TERRIBLE SAD
DE MAN AIN'T ASLEEPHE'S DEAD
THEY HAD PICTURES HUNG ON THE WALLSMAINLY WASHINGTONS AND LAFAYETTES AND BATTLES AND HIGHLAND MARYS AND ONE CALLED SIGNING THE DECLARATION THERE WAS SOME THAT THEY CALLED CRAYONS WHICH ONE OF THE DAUGHTERS WHICH WAS DEAD MADE HER OWN SELF WHEN SHE WAS ONLY FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
BY AND BY WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE BETTER DO AND FOUND THERE WARN'T NO WAY BUT JUST TO GO ALONG DOWN WITH THE RAFT TILL WE GOT A CHANCE TO BUY A CANOE TO GO BACK IN
 AND THERE AIN'T NO COWARDS AMONGST THE GRANGERFORDS EITHER
IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO MAKE UP MY MIND THAT THESE LIARS WARN'T NO KINGS NOR DUKES AT ALL BUT JUST LOW-DOWN HUMBUGS AND FRAUDS
JIST BECAUSE WE STOOD ON OUR RIGHTS_THAT'S WHAT FOR
 BY THE TIME I GOT THERE THE SKY WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE GRAY IN THE EAST
AND NOBODY SAYING ANYTHING TO HIM EITHER BECAUSE THE KING WAS TALKING AND THEY WAS ALL BUSY LISTENING
THEY TIPTOED AWAY
WE'LL LET IT ALONE FOR TO-DAY BECAUSE OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT TO GO BY THAT TOWN YONDER IN DAYLIGHTIT MIGHTN'T BE HEALTHY TOWARDS NIGHT IT BEGUN TO DARKEN UP AND LOOK LIKE RAIN
 BUT THEY SAILED INTO DIGGING ANYWAY BY THE FLICKER OF THE LIGHTNING AND SENT A MAN TO THE NEAREST HOUSE A HALF A MILE OFF TO BORROW ONE
 NOT BY A BLAME SIGHT
 OH NO I RECKON NOT
THE HANDS WAS GONE TO THE FIELDS
BUT BY THIS TIME SOMEBODY HAD LET THEM LOOSE AND HERE THEY COME MAKING POWWOW ENOUGH FOR A MILLION
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER PLEASE WRITE A LINE OR TWO AND SIGN YOUR NAMES THE OLD GENTLEMAN WROTE BUT NOBODY COULDN'T READ IT
 BUT I SAYS I GOT TO DO ITI CAN'T GET OUT OF IT
PRETTY SOON I HEARD A TWIG SNAP DOWN IN THE DARK AMONGST THE TREESSOMETHING WAS A STIRRING
AND WHEN THEY GOT PRETTY CLOSE ON TO US WE DODGED INTO THE BUSH AND LET THEM GO BY AND THEN DROPPED IN BEHIND THEM
ONE MORNING I HAPPENED TO TURN OVER THE SALT-CELLAR AT BREAKFAST
 I KNOW BETTER I COUNTED M MYSELF WELL I'VE COUNTED THEM TWICE AUNTY AND I CAN'T MAKE BUT NINE SHE LOOKED OUT OF ALL PATIENCE BUT OF COURSE SHE COME TO COUNTANYBODY WOULD
HE HAD ABOUT A MILLION WIVES WHY YES DAT'S SO
THEN PRETTY SOON SHERBURN SORT OF LAUGHED
 HE WHITENED A LITTLE
 SHE WAS VERY DEEP AND I SEE IN A MINUTE THERE WARN'T MUCH CHANCE FOR ANYBODY BEING ALIVE IN HER
WHAT THEY WANTED WAS LOW COMEDYAND MAYBE SOMETHING RUTHER WORSE THAN LOW COMEDY HE RECKONED
 WHERE'S THAT TEN CENTS
 THE KING HE GIVE ME A LEFT-HANDED LOOK OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE AND SO I KNOWED ENOUGH TO TALK ON THE RIGHT SIDE
LOOK AT IT GENTLEMEN AND LADIES ALL
STEAD OF BEING FIXED SO I COULD TAKE MY OWN TIME IF I WANTED TO AND SEE ALL THE FUN AND HAVE MARY JANE AT MY BACK TO SAVE ME AND SET ME FREE WHEN THE CLOSE-FIT COME HERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD BETWIXT ME AND SUDDEN DEATH BUT JUST THEM TATTOO-MARKS
 AND AIN'T THAT A BIG ENOUGH MAJORITY IN ANY TOWN SO THEY GOT READY TO GO DOWN STAIRS AGAIN
WELL O COURSE DAT NIGGER WANT TO KEEP ME OUT ER DE BUSINESS BEKASE HE SAYS DEY WARN'T BUSINESS NOUGH FOR TWO BANKS SO HE SAY I COULD PUT IN MY FIVE DOLLARS EN HE PAY ME THIRTY-FIVE AT DE EN ER DE YEAR
HUCK'S FATHER.THE FOND PARENT.REFORM
THEY HAIN'T NO RIGHT TO SHUT HIM UP
 WHAT IS YOU A-TALKIN BOUT
 ONE OF THESE WAS THAT DOCTOR
PLAY THE LAST LINK IS BROKEN'THAT'S THE THING THAT LL SCOOP A RAT QUICKER N ANYTHING ELSE
BUT THE HISTRIONIC MUSE IS THE DARLING
 BUT WE DIDN'T SEE NO RAFTS LAYING UP
I HAD TO PART THE WILLOW BRANCHES TO GET IN
 IT'S JUST AS EASY WHICH CANDLE  I SAYS
AT LAST I HAD AN IDEA
 PA'S LUCK DIDN'T HOLD OUT
JUST THEN SHERBURN STEPS OUT ON TO THE ROOF OF HIS LITTLE FRONT PORCH WITH A DOUBLE-BARREL GUN IN HIS HAND AND TAKES HIS STAND PERFECTLY CA'M AND DELIBERATE NOT SAYING A WORD
BUT PRETTY SOON THE NEW GENTLEMAN BROKE IN AND SAYS
ALONG DURING THE MORNING I BORROWED A SHEET AND A WHITE SHIRT OFF OF THE CLOTHES-LINE
 BUT BY AND BY ALONG COMES ANOTHER ONE AND THIS TIME I WON
WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY SWARMED INTO THE GRAVEYARD AND WASHED OVER IT LIKE AN OVERFLOW
 AND WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY BENT OVER AND LOOKED IN THE COFFIN AND TOOK ONE SIGHT AND THEN THEY BUST OUT A-CRYING SO YOU COULD A HEARD THEM TO ORLEANS MOST
THE OLD MAN WAS UPTOWN AGAIN BEFORE BREAKFAST BUT COULDN'T GET NO TRACK OF TOM
SO WE CRUISED ALONG UP-SHORE TILL WE GOT KIND OF TIRED AND BEAT OUT
POOR WILLIAM AFFLICTED AS HE IS HIS HEART'S ALUZ RIGHT
 SOME OTHER PRISONERS HAS DONE IT ONE ER DEM BIG CAT-TAIL-LOOKIN MULLEN-STALKS WOULD GROW IN HEAH MARS TOM I RECK'N BUT SHE WOULDN'T BE WUTH HALF DE TROUBLE SHE'D COSS DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT
COME IN SAYS THE WOMAN AND I DID
I FOUND AN OLD RUSTY WOOD-SAW WITHOUT ANY HANDLE
AND IT PLEASED THE GIRLS TOOTICKLED THEM SO THEY CLEAN FORGOT THEY EVER HAD A TROUBLE IN THE WORLD
 I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT
THE FIRST CHANCE WE GOT THE DUKE HE HAD SOME SHOW BILLS PRINTED
IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS PLAYING DOUBLE
THE NEARER IT GOT TO NOON THAT DAY THE THICKER AND THICKER WAS THE WAGONS AND HORSES IN THE STREETS AND MORE COMING ALL THE TIME
 YOU MAKE THEM A WITCH PIE
AND SO IT MAKES IT SO ROTTEN DIFFICULT TO GET UP A DIFFICULT PLAN
WOULD YOU KNOW THE BOY AGAIN IF YOU WAS TO SEE HIM HINES I RECKON I WOULD BUT I DON'T KNOW
NO IT WOULDN'T DOTHERE AIN'T NECESSITY ENOUGH FOR IT FOR WHAT  I SAYS
 AIN'T THAT SO YOU BET IT IS
THEN THEY WAKED UP ANOTHER FELLOW AND TOLD HIM AND LAUGHED BUT HE DIDN'T LAUGH
HOLD THE NEEDLE STILL AND POKE THE THREAD AT IT
 I DON'T TAKE NO STOCK IN MATHEMATICS ANYWAY
EN I AST M IF DEY GWYNE TO GRAB A YOUNG WHITE GENLMAN'S PROPATY EN GIT A HID'N FOR IT
 I JUST EXPECTED THERE'D BE SOMEBODY LAYING DOWN IN IT BECAUSE PEOPLE OFTEN DONE THAT TO FOOL FOLKS AND WHEN A CHAP HAD PULLED A SKIFF OUT MOST TO IT THEY'D RAISE UP AND LAUGH AT HIM
THE LIGHTNING WAS GLARING AND FLITTERING AROUND SO CONSTANT THAT WE COULD SEE THEM PLENTY SOON ENOUGH TO THROW HER HEAD THIS WAY OR THAT AND MISS THEM
TOM DIDN'T YOU THINK AUNT SALLY D OPEN OUT HER ARMS AND SAY SID SAWYER MY LAND SHE SAYS BREAKING IN AND JUMPING FOR HIM YOU IMPUDENT YOUNG RASCAL TO FOOL A BODY SO AND WAS GOING TO HUG HIM BUT HE FENDED HER OFF AND SAYS
WE GOT A SPLENDID STOCK OF SORTED SPIDERS AND BUGS AND FROGS AND CATERPILLARS AND ONE THING OR ANOTHER
THEN HE SAYS SLOW AND SCORNFUL
AND HIS AUNT POLLY SHE SAID TOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT OLD MISS WATSON SETTING JIM FREE IN HER WILL
 T'OTHER ONE SAID THIS WARN'T ONE OF THE SHORT ONES HE RECKONEDAND THEN THEY LAUGHED AND HE SAID IT OVER AGAIN AND THEY LAUGHED AGAIN
 JIM HE SPOKE TO THE DUKE AND SAID HE HOPED IT WOULDN'T TAKE BUT A FEW HOURS BECAUSE IT GOT MIGHTY HEAVY AND TIRESOME TO HIM WHEN HE HAD TO LAY ALL DAY IN THE WIGWAM TIED WITH THE ROPE
AND IF I DON'T EVER SEE YOU AGAIN I SHA'N'T EVER FORGET YOU AND I'LL THINK OF YOU A MANY AND A MANY A TIME AND I'LL PRAY FOR YOU TOO!"AND SHE WAS GONE
IT'S ALL RIGHT
 WE FETCHED AN ARMFUL AND HID IT IN THE WEEDS AND SET DOWN TO REST AND TOM SAYS KIND OF DISSATISFIED
 HE MADE UP A LOT AND WROTE THEM OUT ON A PAPER AND READ THEM OFF SO
TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THE UNDERTAKER COME WITH HIS MAN AND THEY SET THE COFFIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM ON A COUPLE OF CHAIRS AND THEN SET ALL OUR CHAIRS IN ROWS AND BORROWED MORE FROM THE NEIGHBORS TILL THE HALL AND THE PARLOR AND THE DINING-ROOM WAS FULL
TRYIN TO GIVE US THE SLIP WAS YE YOU PUP
 AND THEN ONE BY ONE THEY GOT UP AND STOOD AND WENT A-WEAVING AROUND THE RING SO GENTLE AND WAVY AND GRACEFUL THE MEN LOOKING EVER SO TALL AND AIRY AND STRAIGHT WITH THEIR HEADS BOBBING AND SKIMMING ALONG AWAY UP THERE UNDER THE TENT-ROOF AND EVERY LADY'S ROSE-LEAFY DRESS FLAPPING SOFT AND SILKY AROUND HER HIPS AND SHE LOOKING LIKE THE MOST LOVELIEST PARASOL
 NEXT MORNING CHOP OFF HER HEAD  AND HE MADE EVERY ONE OF THEM TELL HIM A TALE EVERY NIGHT
YOU SPOT
 THE SAME IF YOU SHOOK THE TABLE-CLOTH AFTER SUNDOWN
ONCE I GOT A FISH-LINE BUT NO HOOKS
WELL THERE WAS A BIG OUTLANDISH PARROT ON EACH SIDE OF THE CLOCK MADE OUT OF SOMETHING LIKE CHALK AND PAINTED UP GAUDY
 BUT WHEN HE SEES THE CANOE HE DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF HERSAID SHE WAS BIG ENOUGH FOR ONE BUT DIDN'T LOOK PRETTY SAFE FOR TWO
NOTHING IN SIGHT
 SO THEY'D GOT TO WORK THAT OFFI NEVER SEE SUCH A GIRAFFT AS THE KING WAS FOR WANTING TO SWALLOW EVERYTHING
 WHY THEY'D STEAL THE VERYWHY GOODNESS SAKES YOU CAN GUESS WHAT KIND OF A FLUSTER I WAS IN BY THE TIME MIDNIGHT COME LAST NIGHT
AND HE SAID THERE WAS A-RABS THERE TOO AND ELEPHANTS AND THINGS
 SO WE ALLOWED WE WOULD STEAL EVERYTHING THERE WAS THAT COME HANDY
YES SAYS I AND OTHER TIMES WHEN THINGS IS DULL THEY FUSS WITH THE PARLYMENT
 I BET I WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM
THE END
SO AWAY THEY WENT MAD AND YELLING AND SNATCHING DOWN EVERY CLOTHES-LINE THEY COME TO TO DO THE HANGING WITH
THESE RAPSCALLIONS WANTED TO TRY THE NONESUCH AGAIN BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH MONEY IN IT BUT THEY JUDGED IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE BECAUSE MAYBE THE NEWS MIGHT A WORKED ALONG DOWN BY THIS TIME
HUCK DOES YOU RECK'N WE GWYNE TO RUN ACROST ANY MO KINGS ON DIS TRIP NO I SAYS I RECKON NOT WELL SAYS HE DAT'S ALL RIGHT DEN
 BUT I'M SORRY M'AM AND I WON'T DO IT NO MOREI WON'T HONEST YOU WON'T WON'T YOU
 I HAD TRIED TO GET OUT OF THAT CABIN MANY A TIME BUT I COULDN'T FIND NO WAY
AND THE KING TOLD HIM TO SHUT UP AND SAID OH YES IT'S MIGHTY LIKELY AND SHOOK ME UP AGAIN AND SAID HE RECKONED HE'D DROWND ME
 SEEGARS I BET YOUAND COST FIVE CENTS APIECE SOLID CASH
WELL I'D BEN A-RUNNING A LITTLE TEMPERANCE REVIVAL THAR BOUT A WEEK AND WAS THE PET OF THE WOMEN FOLKS BIG AND LITTLE FOR I WAS MAKIN IT MIGHTY WARM FOR THE RUMMIES I TELL YOU AND TAKIN AS MUCH AS FIVE OR SIX DOLLARS A NIGHTTEN CENTS A HEAD CHILDREN AND NIGGERS FREEAND BUSINESS A-GROWIN ALL THE TIME WHEN SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER A LITTLE REPORT GOT AROUND LAST NIGHT THAT I HAD A WAY OF PUTTIN IN MY TIME WITH A PRIVATE JUG ON THE SLY
CHAPTER VII
CHAPTER VII
WHO'S EVERYBODY
HERE'S THE TICKET
HE'S SAID HE'LL TELL AND HE WILL
WELL I GETS UP A-WONDERING AND GOES DOWN STAIRSNOBODY AROUND
I CAN'T REST JIM TILL WE GIVE HER A RUMMAGING
 THEN FOR AN HOUR IT WAS DEADLY DULL AND I WAS FIDGETY
PRETTY SOON JIM SAYS
 I RECKON YOU AIN'T USED TO LYING IT DON'T SEEM TO COME HANDY
 THE DUKE'S ROOM WAS PRETTY SMALL BUT PLENTY GOOD ENOUGH AND SO WAS MY CUBBY
 WHEN THE BOAT WAS GONE THE KING MADE ME PADDLE UP ANOTHER MILE TO A LONESOME PLACE AND THEN HE GOT ASHORE AND SAYS
 _GLORY GLORY HALLELUJAH AND SO ON
DO A LITTLE IN PATENT MEDICINES
 THE LAW BACKS THAT OLD JUDGE THATCHER UP AND HELPS HIM TO KEEP ME OUT O MY PROPERTY
 YES I'LL GO BEFORE BREAKFASTI'LL BE GLAD TO
 SO I LET IT GO AT THAT THOUGH I COULDN'T SEE NO ADVANTAGE IN MY REPRESENTING A PRISONER IF I GOT TO SET DOWN AND CHAW OVER A LOT OF GOLD-LEAF DISTINCTIONS LIKE THAT EVERY TIME I SEE A CHANCE TO HOG A WATERMELON
DON'T YOU HOLLER
EXPECTATION.A WHITE LIE.FLOATING CURRENCY.RUNNING BY CAIRO.SWIMMING ASHORE
 THINK'S I MAYBE IT'S PAP THOUGH I WARN'T EXPECTING HIM
OF COURSE I WANTED TO SLIDE DOWN AND GET IT OUT OF THERE BUT I DASN'T TRY IT
EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT NOW
AND YET SOMEHOW I COULDN'T THINK ABOUT NOTHING ELSE
SO I TOLD HIM JUST HOW TO FIND THE RAFT AND THEN HE STARTED
AND BY AND BY HE SAYS
 THEY HAD BIG BRASS DOG-IRONS THAT COULD HOLD UP A SAW-LOG
I GOT TO SET STILL AND FLOAT AND YET IT'S MIGHTY FIDGETY BUSINESS TO HAVE TO HOLD YOUR HANDS STILL AT SUCH A TIME
 THERE WARN'T NO MORE POPULAR MAN IN TOWN THAN WHAT THAT UNDERTAKER WAS
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ABLE TO READ IT
 HARVEY AND WILLIAM'S THE ONLY ONES THAT'S LEFT NOW
 I RECK'N DEY'S GWYNE TO BE MIGHTY ROUGH TIMES BUCK WENT OFF THOUT WAKING ME UP WELL I RECK'N HE DID
THE DOOR OF THE CAVERN WAS BIG ENOUGH TO ROLL A HOGSHEAD IN AND ON ONE SIDE OF THE DOOR THE FLOOR STUCK OUT A LITTLE BIT AND WAS FLAT AND A GOOD PLACE TO BUILD A FIRE ON
THE BOAT FLOATED ON AND WENT OUT OF SIGHT AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE ISLAND
BUT UNCLE SILAS HE SAID THERE WARN'T NO OCCASION TO BEBOYS WILL BE BOYS HE SAID AND YOU'LL SEE THIS ONE TURN UP IN THE MORNING ALL SOUND AND RIGHT
LIKE AS NOT WE GOT TO BE TOGETHER A BLAMED LONG TIME ON THIS H-YER RAFT BILGEWATER AND SO WHAT'S THE USE O YOUR BEIN SOUR
AND HERE WOULD COME A BLAST OF WIND THAT WOULD BEND THE TREES DOWN AND TURN UP THE PALE UNDERSIDE OF THE LEAVES
 I GOT UNDER THE TABLE AND RAISED THE BLANKET AND WENT TO WORK TO SAW A SECTION OF THE BIG BOTTOM LOG OUTBIG ENOUGH TO LET ME THROUGH
 I NEVER SEE MONEY HAULED IN BY THE WAGON-LOAD LIKE THAT BEFORE
 I GOT TO STEAL THAT MONEY SOMEHOW
OH DEAR DEAR TO THINK THEY AIN'T EVER GOING TO SEE EACH OTHER ANY MORE BUT THEY WILL_AND INSIDE OF TWO WEEKSAND I KNOW IT SAYS I
 PREACHIN'S MY LINE TOO AND WORKIN CAMP-MEETIN'S AND MISSIONARYIN AROUND NOBODY NEVER SAID ANYTHING FOR A WHILE
 EN YOU AIN DEADYOU AIN DROWNDEDYOU'S BACK AGIN
ON THE CONTRARY I DID THE KING KIND OF RUFFLES UP AND SAYS
 I LAY IT NEVER SAWED ITSELF OFF S'ISOMEBODY SAWED IT S'I
 I RECKON I'D BETTER PUT EM ON BUT I'D RUTHER NOT IT'S SO WARM
IN MY OPINION SHE WAS JUST FULL OF SAND
YOU STOP THAT PUTTING ON FRILLS
 WELL ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER DARK WE COME ALONG DOWN IN OUR TRADING-SCOW AND IT WAS SO DARK WE DIDN'T NOTICE THE WRECK TILL WE WAS RIGHT ON IT
 _NO
CLER THE TRACK THAR
 HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF MY VOICE COMING OUT OF THE TREE AT FIRST
SO TOM SAID NOW FOR THE NONNAMOUS LETTERS
 YOU KEEP YOUR HEAD SHET AND MIND Y'R OWN AFFAIRSIF YOU GOT ANY
 THEN I SET OUT A LINE TO CATCH SOME FISH FOR BREAKFAST
 I WARN'T LONESOME NOW
IS HE GOING TO DECEIVE A SHIP CLERK?_SO AS TO GET THEM TO LET MISS MARY JANE GO ABOARD
WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BAD DIS TIME UZ BEKASE I HEAR SUMPN OVER YONDER ON DE BANK LIKE A WHACK ER A SLAM WHILE AGO EN IT MINE ME ER DE TIME I TREAT MY LITTLE LIZABETH SO ORNERY
AND SOME OF THEM HE HUGGED AND KISSED AS MANY AS FIVE OR SIX TIMESAND HE WAS INVITED TO STAY A WEEK
 THERE WAS AN OLD HAIR TRUNK IN ONE CORNER AND A GUITAR-BOX IN ANOTHER AND ALL SORTS OF LITTLE KNICKKNACKS AND JIMCRACKS AROUND LIKE GIRLS BRISKEN UP A ROOM WITH
 BUT THERE'S ONE THINGHE CAN HAVE A ROPE LADDER
 WHY I DO BELIEVE IT'S A STRANGER
BUT HE CHANGED HIS MIND BECAUSE HE RECKONED THEY WARN'T HIGH ENOUGH YET TO DO ANY HARM
WHY YOU CAN GET HIM SO IN A LITTLE WHILE THAT HE'LL LOVE YOU
 SO I WENT TO TALKING ABOUT OTHER KINGS AND LET SOLOMON SLIDE
 I WAITED TILL I RECKONED HE HAD GOT A GOOD START
 BUT IF ONLY HALF A MANLIKE BUCK HARKNESS THERESHOUTS LYNCH HIM
 THE WOMEN HAD ON SUN-BONNETS
 I RECKONED I COULDN'T STAND IT MORE'N A MINUTE LONGER BUT I SET MY TEETH HARD AND GOT READY TO TRY
 I JUDGED HE HAD GOT DROWNDED AND I WASN'T EVER GOING TO GET OUT ANY MORE
 HE SAID HE WOULD WATCH OUT AND IF THEY TRIED TO COME ANY SUCH GAME ON HIM HE KNOWED OF A PLACE SIX OR SEVEN MILE OFF TO STOW ME IN WHERE THEY MIGHT HUNT TILL THEY DROPPED AND THEY COULDN'T FIND ME
 SO SAYS I TO JIM
COME ALONG THE REST OF YOU
AND AT LAST FIXED UP A PLAN THAT SUITED ME
BUT THEY DIDN'T YELLOCUTE LONG TILL THE AUDIENCE GOT UP AND GIVE THEM A SOLID GOOD CUSSING AND MADE THEM SKIP OUT
 I KNOWED MIGHTY WELL THAT A DROWNDED MAN DON'T FLOAT ON HIS BACK BUT ON HIS FACE
NOT FROM THE WRIST AND ELBOW WITH YOUR ARM OUT TO ONE SIDE LIKE A BOY
 AS I GOT DOWN TOWARDS IT THREE OR FOUR MORE SHOWEDUP ON A HILLSIDE
WHEN WE GOT HOME THE HOUSE WAS ALL DARK AND STILL
IN ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES HERE COMES BOGGS AGAIN BUT NOT ON HIS HORSE
 I WAS SO HUNGRY I HAD TO STOP TWO MILES BELOW HERE AT A FARM
 THEN I CARRIED THE SACK ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS ACROSS THE GRASS AND THROUGH THE WILLOWS EAST OF THE HOUSE TO A SHALLOW LAKE THAT WAS FIVE MILE WIDE AND FULL OF RUSHESAND DUCKS TOO YOU MIGHT SAY IN THE SEASON
ALL I WANTED WAS A CHANGE I WARN'T PARTICULAR
THEN THE THING FOR US TO DO WAS TO GO FOR THE MAGICIANS
 DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT A FEUD IS NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORETELL ME ABOUT IT WELL SAYS BUCK A FEUD IS THIS WAY
BUT BY AND BY SHE LET IT OUT THAT MOSES HAD BEEN DEAD A CONSIDERABLE LONG TIME
 WHY LOOK AT ONE OF THEM PRISONERS IN THE BOTTOM DUNGEON OF THE CASTLE DEEF IN THE HARBOR OF MARSEILLES THAT DUG HIMSELF OUT THAT WAY
BUT YOU GOT A GUN HAIN'T YOU
AND THEN THE KING HE SHOVED IN AND GOT OFF SOME OF HIS USUAL RUBBAGE AND AT LAST THE JOB WAS THROUGH AND THE UNDERTAKER BEGUN TO SNEAK UP ON THE COFFIN WITH HIS SCREW-DRIVER
NOW I KNOW HOW TO FIX IT
BUT WE NEVER GOT ANYTHING BUT SOME DOUGHNUTS AND JAM THOUGH BEN ROGERS GOT A RAG DOLL AND JO HARPER GOT A HYMN-BOOK AND A TRACT
 IF YOU NOTICE MOST FOLKS DON'T GO TO CHURCH ONLY WHEN THEY'VE GOT TO
 WE TALKED ABOUT CAIRO AND WONDERED WHETHER WE WOULD KNOW IT WHEN WE GOT TO IT
 A COUPLE OF SQUIRRELS SET ON A LIMB AND JABBERED AT ME VERY FRIENDLY
I AIN'T COMFORTABLE
I STOOD A-LOOKING AT HIM
 WE FOUND A SICK NIGGER SUNNING HIMSELF IN A BACK YARD AND HE SAID EVERYBODY THAT WARN'T TOO YOUNG OR TOO SICK OR TOO OLD WAS GONE TO CAMP-MEETING ABOUT TWO MILE BACK IN THE WOODS
 I SAID PADDLE ASHORE THE FIRST TIME A LIGHT SHOWED AND TELL THEM PAP WAS BEHIND COMING ALONG WITH A TRADING-SCOW AND WAS A GREEN HAND AT THE BUSINESS AND WANTED TO KNOW HOW FAR IT WAS TO CAIRO
AND IT DIDN'T COOL IT A BIT NEITHER THE WAY I'VE SEEN THEM KIND OF INTERRUPTIONS DO LOTS OF TIMES
 THEN I BOUNCED FOR THE TOP IN A HURRY FOR I WAS NEARLY BUSTING
SO WE SET THERE WATCHING AND BY AND BY HE STIRS A BIT AND OPENED HIS EYES VERY NATURAL AND TAKES A LOOK AND SAYS
 HE MADE ABOUT A DOZEN LONG GASPS HIS BREAST LIFTING THE BIBLE UP WHEN HE DRAWED IN HIS BREATH AND LETTING IT DOWN AGAIN WHEN HE BREATHED IT OUTAND AFTER THAT HE LAID STILL
 PRETTY SOON WE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CROWD AND THE NOISE OF THE TRAMPING WAS LIKE A SOLDIER MARCH
 BY AND BY I WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO HAVE A LOOK AND THERE LAID A MAN ON THE GROUND
 I WAS SCARED
HISTORY DON'T TELL NO WAY NOW DE DUKE HE'S A TOLERBLE LIKELY MAN IN SOME WAYS YES A DUKE'S DIFFERENT
 AND WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SAW HIS LEG OFF FOR ANYWAY WELL SOME OF THE BEST AUTHORITIES HAS DONE IT
AND EVERYBODY WANTED HIM TO LIVE IN THEIR HOUSES AND SAID THEY'D THINK IT WAS AN HONOR
NEIGHBORS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE NEW COUPLE IS FRAUDS OR NOT
 I RUN IN THE PARLOR AND TOOK A SWIFT LOOK AROUND AND THE ONLY PLACE I SEE TO HIDE THE BAG WAS IN THE COFFIN
RATS.LIVELY BEDFELLOWS.THE STRAW DUMMY
 THEY TREAT THEM WORSE THAN DOGS DON'T THEY GIVE EM HOLIDAYS THE WAY WE DO CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S WEEK AND FOURTH OF JULY OH JUST LISTEN
 BUT IT WARN'T SO
BUT WE CAN'T
 WHEN I START IN TO STEAL A NIGGER OR A WATERMELON OR A SUNDAY-SCHOOL BOOK I AIN'T NO WAYS PARTICULAR HOW IT'S DONE SO IT'S DONE
THIS AIN'T NO THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR JOB
N WHO DUG THAT-AIR HOLE
I KNOWED VERY WELL WHERE THE RIGHT PLAN WAS GOING TO COME FROM
SOME SICKLY GRASS-PATCHES IN THE BIG YARD BUT MOSTLY IT WAS BARE AND SMOOTH LIKE AN OLD HAT WITH THE NAP RUBBED OFF
 IF WE WAS TO GIVE BOTH OUR SHARES TO HIM NOW IT WOULDN'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE AFTER THE ROW AND THE WAY WE'VE SERVED HIM
MAKING THEM PENS WAS A DISTRESSID TOUGH JOB AND SO WAS THE SAW
 FOLKS GOT UP EVERYWHERES IN THE CROWD AND WORKED THEIR WAY JUST BY MAIN STRENGTH TO THE MOURNERS BENCH WITH THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN THEIR FACES
WHAT IS HE UP TO ANYWAY
I DON'T LIKE THAT SHOOTING FROM BEHIND A BUSH
 BUT HE NEEDN'T A WORRIEDIT WAS JEST WHAT I WAS AT THEN HE WEAVES ALONG AGAIN PERFECTLY CA'M AND GOES TO DROPPING IN HIS FUNERAL ORGIES AGAIN EVERY NOW AND THEN JUST LIKE HE DONE BEFORE
 I HOPED THEY WAS GOING TO SAY HE COULD HAVE ONE OR TWO OF THE CHAINS TOOK OFF BECAUSE THEY WAS ROTTEN HEAVY OR COULD HAVE MEAT AND GREENS WITH HIS BREAD AND WATER
 _SO BOY
SAID THIS DROWNDED MAN WAS JUST HIS SIZE AND WAS RAGGED AND HAD UNCOMMON LONG HAIR WHICH WAS ALL LIKE PAP
 WHAT'S A FESS A FESSA FESS IS_YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHAT A FESS IS
NEXT DAY TOWARDS NIGHT WE LAID UP UNDER A LITTLE WILLOW TOWHEAD OUT IN THE MIDDLE WHERE THERE WAS A VILLAGE ON EACH SIDE OF THE RIVER AND THE DUKE AND THE KING BEGUN TO LAY OUT A PLAN FOR WORKING THEM TOWNS
 THEN HE STUDIED IT OVER AND SAID COULDN'T I PUT ON SOME OF THEM OLD THINGS AND DRESS UP LIKE A GIRL
AND LEAVE MY SISTERS WITH THEM YES
WHY HOW LONG YOU BEEN ON THE ISLAND JIM I COME HEAH DE NIGHT ARTER YOU'S KILLED WHAT ALL THAT TIME YESINDEEDY AND AIN'T YOU HAD NOTHING BUT THAT KIND OF RUBBAGE TO EAT NO SAHNUFFN ELSE WELL YOU MUST BE MOST STARVED AIN'T YOU I RECK'N I COULD EAT A HOSS
 WELL ALL AT ONCE HERE COMES A CANOE
BUT BY AND BY SHE DROPPED ON TO PAP AND THE MURDER AND THEN I WAS PRETTY WILLING TO LET HER CLATTER RIGHT ALONG
I CAN STOP ANYWHERE I WANT TO
ASH-HOPPER AND BIG KETTLE TO BILE SOAP IN BY THE LITTLE HUT
 THE ISLAND WAS THREE MILE LONG
 I SAYS
 I SAYS
 I SAYS
 I SAYS
 I SAYS
 I SAYS
 I SAYS
 I SAYS
 I SAYS
 I SAYS
 A LITTLE RIPPLY COOL BREEZE BEGUN TO BLOW AND THAT WAS AS GOOD AS SAYING THE NIGHT WAS ABOUT DONE
 BUT I GO A GOOD DEAL ON INSTINCT
HELLO WHAT'S UP
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN COMPLETE BY MARK TWAIN SAMUEL CLEMENS
AND LONG BLACK STREAKSRAFTS
HE LIT OFF OF HIS HORSE AND GOT BEHIND A LITTLE WOODPILE AND KEP HIS HORSE BEFORE HIM TO STOP THE BULLETS
 THE SHEPHERDSONS DONE THE SAME
HE WOULD A FLUNG US INTO ILLINOIS
I TUCK OUT EN SHIN DOWN DE HILL EN SPEC TO STEAL A SKIFT LONG DE SHO SOM'ERS BOVE DE TOWN BUT DEY WUZ PEOPLE A-STIRRING YIT SO I HID IN DE OLE TUMBLE-DOWN COOPER-SHOP ON DE BANK TO WAIT FOR EVERYBODY TO GO WAY
 I WAS EVER SO GLAD TO SEE JIM
EN DEY AIN'T NOBODY KIN GIT UP A PLAN DAT'S MO MIXED-UP EN SPLENDID DEN WHAT DAT ONE WUZ WE WAS ALL GLAD AS WE COULD BE BUT TOM WAS THE GLADDEST OF ALL BECAUSE HE HAD A BULLET IN THE CALF OF HIS LEG
HE WAS QUIET AND LOOKED UNEASY
SHE NEVER COMPLAINED BUT SHE KINDER PINED AWAY AND DID NOT LIVE LONG
 I GOT AN OLD TIN LAMP AND AN IRON RING AND WENT OUT IN THE WOODS AND RUBBED AND RUBBED TILL I SWEAT LIKE AN INJUN CALCULATING TO BUILD A PALACE AND SELL IT
 THERE'S ONE MORE THINGA THING THAT NOBODY DON'T KNOW BUT ME
 SHE FLUNG HERSELF AT TOM CRYING AND SAYS
BUT I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE I HAD TRIED THEM LOTS OF TIMES MYSELF AND THEY WOULDN'T STING ME
 JUST SET STILL AND TAKE IT LIKE A MAN
SO I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND MADE UP MY MIND I WOULDN'T FORGET I WAS A GIRL
 THEN I WAS GLAD I HADN'T FOUND THE BED WHEN I WANTED IT
I WENT ON A-WHIMPERING AND SAYS
THEY WARN'T NOTHING ELSE BUT MUDMUD AS BLACK AS TAR AND NIGH ABOUT A FOOT DEEP IN SOME PLACES AND TWO OR THREE INCHES DEEP IN ALL THE PLACES
 HERE A LONELY HEART BROKE AND A WORN SPIRIT WENT TO ITS REST AFTER THIRTY-SEVEN YEARS OF SOLITARY CAPTIVITY
 AND HOW SLOW AND STILL THE TIME DID DRAG ALONG
 JIMMY THAT'S ONE OF THE CHILDREN RUN AND TELL LIZE TO PUT ON ANOTHER PLATE FOR DINNER EVERYBODY MADE A RUSH FOR THE FRONT DOOR BECAUSE OF COURSE A STRANGER DON'T COME EVERY YEAR AND SO HE LAYS OVER THE YALLER-FEVER FOR INTEREST WHEN HE DOES COME
IT WAS TWELVE FOOT WIDE AND ABOUT FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN FOOT LONG AND THE TOP STOOD ABOVE WATER SIX OR SEVEN INCHESA SOLID LEVEL FLOOR
BUT AS I COME TO THE GIRLS ROOM THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND I SEE MARY JANE SETTING BY HER OLD HAIR TRUNK WHICH WAS OPEN AND SHE'D BEEN PACKING THINGS IN ITGETTING READY TO GO TO ENGLAND
SO I KNOWED THE RIVER HAD BEGUN TO RISE
SO THEN I DIDN'T CARE NO MORE ABOUT HIM BECAUSE I DON'T TAKE NO STOCK IN DEAD PEOPLE
 I SEE I'D GOT TO INVENT A BAR OR FORGET THE NAME OF THE ONE WE GOT AGROUND ONORNOW I STRUCK AN IDEA AND FETCHED IT OUT
YOU DON'T LIKE TROUBLE AND DANGER
 WE WANT TO BE AWFUL SQUARE AND OPEN AND ABOVE-BOARD HERE YOU KNOW
 "WHY WHAT IN THE WORLDPLAGUE TAKE THE THINGS I'LL COUNT M AGAIN SO I SLIPPED BACK THE ONE I HAD AND WHEN SHE GOT DONE COUNTING SHE SAYS
 THEN HE TOOK A LOOK TO SEE HOW ME AND JIM WAS GETTING ALONG WITH THE PENS
SHERBURN.ATTENDING THE CIRCUS.INTOXICATION IN THE RING.THE THRILLING TRAGEDY
 SO WE TALKED IT OVER ALL ONE NIGHT DRIFTING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER TRYING TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS WHETHER TO DROP THE WATERMELONS OR THE CANTELOPES OR THE MUSHMELONS OR WHAT
PRETTY SOON HE CRAWLS OUT FROM UNDER THE WIGWAM AND SAYS
 I HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE
 I TOTED UP A LOAD AND WENT BACK AND SET DOWN ON THE BOW OF THE SKIFF TO REST
 WHEN WE GOT IN WE COULDN'T HARDLY SEE ANYTHING IT WAS SO DARK
 THEN I TOOK UP THE PIG AND HELD HIM TO MY BREAST WITH MY JACKET SO HE COULDN'T DRIP TILL I GOT A GOOD PIECE BELOW THE HOUSE AND THEN DUMPED HIM INTO THE RIVER
MOTTO MAGGIORE FRETTA MINORE OTTO  GOT IT OUT OF A BOOKMEANS THE MORE HASTE THE LESS SPEED GEEWHILLIKINS I SAYS BUT WHAT DOES THE REST OF IT MEAN WE AIN'T GOT NO TIME TO BOTHER OVER THAT HE SAYS
 THE NIGGER NAT HE ONLY JUST HOLLERED WITCHES ONCE AND KEELED OVER ON TO THE FLOOR AMONGST THE DOGS AND BEGUN TO GROAN LIKE HE WAS DYING
 AND DON'T CALL IT MULLEN CALL IT PITCHIOLATHAT'S ITS RIGHT NAME WHEN IT'S IN A PRISON
 NOT BY A GOOD DEAL
BLAME IT THIS WHOLE THING IS JUST AS EASY AND AWKWARD AS IT CAN BE
 HE SET UP A LITTLE PIECE OF POETRY WHICH HE MADE HIMSELF OUT OF HIS OWN HEADTHREE VERSESKIND OF SWEET AND SADDISHTHE NAME OF IT WAS YES CRUSH COLD WORLD THIS BREAKING HEART"AND HE LEFT THAT ALL SET UP AND READY TO PRINT IN THE PAPER AND DIDN'T CHARGE NOTHING FOR IT
OUT WITH YOU JIM AND SET HER LOOSE
SO HE TOOK A THINK
 IS THAT ALL THE DUKE SAYS YES
 EVERY LITTLE WHILE HE JUMPS UP AND SAYS
 WHO IS IT IT'S TOM SAWYER BY JINGS I MOST SLUMPED THROUGH THE FLOOR
I WENT RIGHT ALONG NOT FIXING UP ANY PARTICULAR PLAN BUT JUST TRUSTING TO PROVIDENCE TO PUT THE RIGHT WORDS IN MY MOUTH WHEN THE TIME COME
THERE WARN'T NOTHING TO DO NOW BUT TO LOOK OUT SHARP FOR THE TOWN AND NOT PASS IT WITHOUT SEEING IT
 I UZ OFF TOO FUR TO HEAR WHAT DEY SAY TO YOUI WUZ FRAID O DE DOGS
 I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WAS TRYING TO HOCUS ME AGAIN
 ONLY THEYTHEYTOLD ME YOU WOULD THEY TOLD YOU I WOULD
 I ROUSED HIM OUT AND SAYS
 WE GOT HER HALF WAY
MR HOBSON AND DEACON LOT HOVEY AND MR BEN RUCKER AND ABNER SHACKLEFORD AND LEVI BELL AND DR ROBINSON AND THEIR WIVES AND THE WIDOW BARTLEY
 THEN I SLID OUT QUIET AND THROWED THE SNAKES CLEAR AWAY AMONGST THE BUSHES
 BUT SHE BROKE OFF TO SAY
 HE WAS THE INNOCENTEST BEST OLD SOUL I EVER SEE
 HIM AND HIS HORSE BOTH WENT HOME PRETTY LEAKY AND CRIPPLED BUT THE GRANGERFORDS HAD TO BE FETCHED HOMEAND ONE OF EM WAS DEAD AND ANOTHER DIED THE NEXT DAY
 EVERYBODY CLAPPED THEIR HANDS AND STOMPED ON THE FLOOR LIKE A PERFECT STORM WHILST THE KING HELD UP HIS HEAD AND SMILED PROUD
SO I TOOK UP A NEEDLE OFF OF THE TABLE AND WENT TO THREADING IT
HE SAID HE NEVER SEE A THING WORK MORE SATISFACTORY
THE LIGHT BEGUN TO COME BEFORE WE GOT TO THE FOOT OF THE ISLAND
SHE'D BE MAD AND DISGUSTED AT HIS RASCALITY AND UNGRATEFULNESS FOR LEAVING HER AND SO SHE'D SELL HIM STRAIGHT DOWN THE RIVER AGAIN
 HERE'S WHAT THE LAW DOES
AND HE SAID PEOPLE ALLOWED THERE'D BE ANOTHER TRIAL TO GET ME AWAY FROM HIM AND GIVE ME TO THE WIDOW FOR MY GUARDIAN AND THEY GUESSED IT WOULD WIN THIS TIME
 WE ARE WHO WE SAY WE ARE
AND THEN HE WOULD GIVE A JUMP AND SCREAM AND SAY ONE HAD BIT HIM ON THE CHEEKBUT I COULDN'T SEE NO SNAKES
NO I HAIN'T EVER SEEN HER SINCE BUT I RECKON I'VE THOUGHT OF HER A MANY AND A MANY A MILLION TIMES AND OF HER SAYING SHE WOULD PRAY FOR ME
HEL-_LO
TOM SAWYER WOUNDED.THE DOCTOR'S STORY.TOM CONFESSES.AUNT POLLY ARRIVES.HAND OUT THEM LETTERS     CHAPTER THE LAST
 SO I SAYS
 SO I SAYS
 SO I SAYS
 SO I SAYS

WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS ALL STILL AND SUNDAY-LIKE AND HOT AND SUNSHINY
 IT WILL BE LONG AFTER SUN-UP THEN AND WHEN YOU ASK FOR HELP YOU TELL THEM YOUR FOLKS ARE ALL DOWN WITH CHILLS AND FEVER
GIT UP AND HUMP YOURSELF JIM
MR KEAN
MR KEAN
WELL HOW'D THE OLD THING PAN OUT THIS TIME DUKE  HE HADN'T BEEN UP-TOWN AT ALL
COL
COL
SO YOU MUSTN'T DISAPPOINT US
 THEN HE STOOD ABOUT FIVE MINUTES PICKING TALLOW-DRIP OFF OF HIS CANDLE AND THINKING
WAS YOU IN THERE YISTERDAY ER LAST NIGHT NO YOUR MAJESTY HONOR BRIGHT NOWNO LIES HONOR BRIGHT YOUR MAJESTY I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH
HE BOUNCED UP AND STARED AT ME WILD
AND HE WARN'T HANGING BACK ANY BUT WAS DOING SOME OF THE HURRYING HIMSELF
 IT WAS THE FIRST I EVER SEE IT GROWING AND IT MADE THE WOODS LOOK SOLEMN AND DISMAL
 "COME AIN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAW BOTH OF THEM SPOKE UP AGAIN AND SAYS
 THEN IN THERE I SEE A MAN STRETCHED ON THE FLOOR AND TIED HAND AND FOOT AND TWO MEN STANDING OVER HIM AND ONE OF THEM HAD A DIM LANTERN IN HIS HAND AND THE OTHER ONE HAD A PISTOL
MY FOLKS WAS LIVING IN PIKE COUNTY IN MISSOURI WHERE I WAS BORN AND THEY ALL DIED OFF BUT ME AND PA AND MY BROTHER IKE
 THEM POOR THINGS WAS THAT GLAD AND HAPPY IT MADE MY HEART ACHE TO SEE THEM GETTING FOOLED AND LIED TO SO BUT I DIDN'T SEE NO SAFE WAY FOR ME TO CHIP IN AND CHANGE THE GENERAL TUNE
AIN'T YOU A SWEET-SCENTED DANDY THOUGH
AND THOUGH IT WOULD TAKE HIM A LONG TIME TO GET THERE WITHOUT MONEY HE WOULD GET THERE ANYWAY AND EVERY TIME HE CONVINCED A PIRATE HE WOULD SAY TO HIM DON'T YOU THANK ME DON'T YOU GIVE ME NO CREDIT
 I BROUGHT MYSELF DOWNYES I DID IT MYSELF
AND THEN THEY GIVE THE PEN TO THE DUKEAND THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THE DUKE LOOKED SICK
 SO I STUCK OUT FOR MO DAN FO DOLLARS EN I SAID F I DIDN GIT IT I'D START A BANK MYSEF
 SO I COME DOWN THE LADDER AND STARTED FOR DOWN-STAIRS
 MOST EVERYBODY WAS ON THE BOAT
SAY I RECKON YOUR FATHER'S POOR AND I'M BOUND TO SAY HE'S IN PRETTY HARD LUCK
THE KING HE SPREAD HIS ARMS AND MARY JANE SHE JUMPED FOR THEM AND THE HARE-LIP JUMPED FOR THE DUKE AND THERE THEY HAD IT
POOTY SOON I'LL BE A-SHOUT'N FOR JOY EN I'LL SAY IT'S ALL ON ACCOUNTS O HUCK
MISS WATSON'S NIGGER JIM HAD A HAIR-BALL AS BIG AS YOUR FIST WHICH HAD BEEN TOOK OUT OF THE FOURTH STOMACH OF AN OX AND HE USED TO DO MAGIC WITH IT
 WELL FOR THE LAND'S SAKE I'LL STOP UP THEM HOLES TO-DAY SAYS UNCLE SILAS LOOKING SORROWFUL
BUT I KNOWED MIGHTY WELL THAT WHENEVER HE GOT HIS PLAN READY IT WOULDN'T HAVE NONE OF THEM OBJECTIONS TO IT
YOU'D SEE ONE STICK HIS NOSE OUT OF A HOLE IN THE CORNER EVERY LITTLE WHILE
AND AFTER THAT FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AS WE FLOATED ALONG THE RAFT WAS A MOST UNCOMMON LIVELY PLACE FOR THERE WARN'T NOTHING BUT SWORD-FIGHTING AND REHEARSINGAS THE DUKE CALLED ITGOING ON ALL THE TIME
THEY'VE GOT THE MONEY AND THEY'D SLIDE RIGHT OUT AND GET AWAY WITH IT
 SO I GIVE IT A SHAKE AND OUT DROPS A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER WITH HALF-PAST TWO WROTE ON IT WITH A PENCIL
 LOOK HERE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO
 IT WAS GETTING GRAY DAYLIGHT NOW
AND I RECKON I COULDN'T A STOOD IT ALL BUT WOULD A HAD TO BUST OUT AND TELL ON OUR GANG IF I HADN'T KNOWED THE SALE WARN'T NO ACCOUNT AND THE NIGGERS WOULD BE BACK HOME IN A WEEK OR TWO
FIRST I KNOW I'LL RUN INTO THE BANK OR A TOWHEAD OR SOMETHING
WELL IT WASN'T FOR A DOG WHY BECAUSE PART OF IT WAS WATERMELON SO IT WASI NOTICED IT
 HOW IS SERVANTS TREATED IN ENGLAND
 A MAN CAN'T GET HIS RIGHTS IN A GOVMENT LIKE THIS
 SHE MOTIONED ME TO BE STILL AND SET DOWN BY ME AND BEGUN TO WHISPER AND SAID WE COULD ALL BE JOYFUL NOW BECAUSE ALL THE SYMPTOMS WAS FIRST-RATE AND HE'D BEEN SLEEPING LIKE THAT FOR EVER SO LONG AND LOOKING BETTER AND PEACEFULLER ALL THE TIME AND TEN TO ONE HE'D WAKE UP IN HIS RIGHT MIND
CHAPTER XI
CHAPTER XI
BUT AFTER HE WAS RESTED HE ALLOWED HE WOULD GIVE HER ONE MORE TURN FOR LUCK AND THIS TIME HE MADE THE TRIP
BUT HUSBAND'S GOING OVER TO SEEHIM AND ANOTHER MAN
 I HAIN'T LOOKED INTO THEM I HAIN'T TOUCHED THEM
A MONTH OR TWO AGO WHEN PETER WAS FIRST TOOK
BUT HE PUT HIS FOOT ON THE GUNNEL AND ROCKED HER AND SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID HE RECKONED HE'D LOOK AROUND FOR A BIGGER ONE
SAY WHO IS YOU
 HOW'S THAT
 WELL THEN THAT'S ALL RIGHT
 HE HAD ONE ANKLE RESTING ON T'OTHER KNEE
 THIS DONE HIM HEAPS OF GOOD AND SO HE GOT CHEERFUL AND COMFORTABLE
BUT THAT AIN'T NO MATTER
 SAID WE'D GOT TO POST JIM FIRST
SHE WORKED ME MIDDLING HARD FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN THE WIDOW MADE HER EASE UP
 YOU MARK THEM WORDSDON'T FORGET I SAID THEM
YOU WANT TO BE STARTING SOMETHING FRESH ALL THE TIME
 DON'T I GENERLY KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT YES DIDN'T I SAY I WAS GOING TO HELP STEAL THE NIGGER YES WELL THEN THAT'S ALL HE SAID AND THAT'S ALL I SAID
 THAT BOOK WAS MADE BY MR MARK TWAIN AND HE TOLD THE TRUTH MAINLY
WHO NAILED HIM IT WAS AN OLD FELLOWA STRANGERAND HE SOLD OUT HIS CHANCE IN HIM FOR FORTY DOLLARS BECUZ HE'S GOT TO GO UP THE RIVER AND CAN'T WAIT
 "BUT HE DONE US A GOOD TURN WITH THE SPOON ANYWAY WITHOUT KNOWING IT AND SO WE'LL GO AND DO HIM ONE WITHOUT HIM KNOWING ITSTOP UP HIS RAT-HOLES THERE WAS A NOBLE GOOD LOT OF THEM DOWN CELLAR AND IT TOOK US A WHOLE HOUR BUT WE DONE THE JOB TIGHT AND GOOD AND SHIPSHAPE
WHEN WE GOT BACK TO THE RAFT AND HE COME TO COUNT UP HE FOUND HE HAD COLLECTED EIGHTY-SEVEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY-FIVE CENTS
 I'M AT MY WIT'S END AND I DON'T MIND ACKNOWLEDGING T I'M RIGHT DOWN SCARED
 COME IN HUCK BUT DOAN LOOK AT HIS FACEIT'S TOO GASHLY I DIDN'T LOOK AT HIM AT ALL
 HE WAS A MIGHTY NICE OLD MAN
AND TOLD ME TO COME WITH A CANDLE
 AND MY SOULS HOW THE PEOPLE YELLED AND LAUGHED AND KEPT IT UP
 WHY CAN'T THE WIDOW GET BACK HER SILVER SNUFFBOX THAT WAS STOLE
I WENT OFF DOWN TO THE RIVER STUDYING OVER THIS THING AND PRETTY SOON I NOTICED THAT MY NIGGER WAS FOLLOWING ALONG BEHIND
THEN SHE GOT TO TALKING ABOUT HER HUSBAND AND ABOUT HER RELATIONS UP THE RIVER AND HER RELATIONS DOWN THE RIVER AND ABOUT HOW MUCH BETTER OFF THEY USED TO WAS AND HOW THEY DIDN'T KNOW BUT THEY'D MADE A MISTAKE COMING TO OUR TOWN INSTEAD OF LETTING WELL ALONEAND SO ON AND SO ON TILL I WAS AFEARD I HAD MADE A MISTAKE COMING TO HER TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE TOWN
 ARE YOU ALL READY
 I TRIED IT
WELL THAT'S MIGHTY CURIOUS
 LAYIN ON O HANDS IS MY BEST HOLTFOR CANCER AND PARALYSIS AND SICH THINGS
 THERE WAS A CROSS IN THE LEFT BOOT-HEEL MADE WITH BIG NAILS TO KEEP OFF THE DEVIL
MUSIC IS A GOOD THING
 SAID THE SHEPHERDSONS LAID FOR THEM IN AMBUSH
AND AT LAST THEY TOOK A CHANGE AND BEGUN TO LAY THEIR HEADS TOGETHER IN THE WIGWAM AND TALK LOW AND CONFIDENTIAL TWO OR THREE HOURS AT A TIME
THEN JIM MANNED THE OARS AND WE TOOK OUT AFTER OUR RAFT
 PEOPLE DO SAY HE WARN'T ANY TOO GOOD TO DO IT
I TRIED FOR A SECOND OR TWO TO BRACE UP AND OUT WITH IT BUT I WARN'T MAN ENOUGHHADN'T THE SPUNK OF A RABBIT
AND ALL STILL AGAINSTILLER THAN EVER
I TOOK THE SACK OF CORN MEAL AND TOOK IT TO WHERE THE CANOE WAS HID AND SHOVED THE VINES AND BRANCHES APART AND PUT IT IN
THERE WAS EMPTY DRYGOODS BOXES UNDER THE AWNINGS AND LOAFERS ROOSTING ON THEM ALL DAY LONG WHITTLING THEM WITH THEIR BARLOW KNIVES
LOOK SHARP NOW
 WHERE IS HE?I WANT MY NIGGER WELL YOU CAN'T GET YOUR NIGGER THAT'S ALLSO DRY UP YOUR BLUBBERING
 SHE HAD FOUR LONG SWEEPS AT EACH END SO WE JUDGED SHE CARRIED AS MANY AS THIRTY MEN LIKELY
 WHAT'S YOUR LINEMAINLY JOUR PRINTER BY TRADE
WHEN JIM BIT INTO IT IT MOST MASHED ALL HIS TEETH OUT
 WE LIT THE LANTERN AND JUDGED SHE WOULD SEE IT
OH HE'S DEAD HE'S DEAD I KNOW HE'S DEAD AND TOM HE TURNED HIS HEAD A LITTLE AND MUTTERED SOMETHING OR OTHER WHICH SHOWED HE WARN'T IN HIS RIGHT MIND
 I HAIN'T BEEN A-NEAR YOUR ROOM SINCE MISS MARY JANE TOOK YOU AND THE DUKE AND SHOWED IT TO YOU THE DUKE SAYS
 I WENT TO THE CAVERN TO GET SOME AND FOUND A RATTLESNAKE IN THERE
AND SHE SET DOWN ON THE BED AND TALKED WITH ME A LONG TIME AND SAID WHAT A SPLENDID BOY SID WAS AND DIDN'T SEEM TO WANT TO EVER STOP TALKING ABOUT HIM
 S'POSE PEOPLE LEFT MONEY LAYING AROUND WHERE HE WASWHAT DID HE DO
 MOS LIKELY DEY HAS RACKETY TIMES IN DE NUSSERY
AND IT WAS WELL A BOAT DIDN'T COME FOR WE HADN'T EVER THOUGHT TO PUT THE GUN IN THE CANOE OR A FISHING-LINE OR ANYTHING TO EAT
I DIDN'T SLEEP MUCH
AND WOULD ALWAYS CALL ME HONEY AND PET ME AND DO EVERYTHING HE COULD THINK OF FOR ME AND HOW GOOD HE ALWAYS WAS
I SET DOWN AGAIN A-SHAKING ALL OVER AND GOT OUT MY PIPE FOR A SMOKE
BUT SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME KEPT SAYING THERE WAS THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL YOU COULD A GONE TO IT
 WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW WHEN GOOD LUCK'S A-COMIN FOR
BUT WHEN IT UZ ALL QUIET AGIN I KNOWED YOU'S IN DE HOUSE SO I STRUCK OUT FOR DE WOODS TO WAIT FOR DAY
 BUT SHE COUNTED AND COUNTED TILL SHE GOT THAT ADDLED SHE'D START TO COUNT IN THE BASKET FOR A SPOON SOMETIMES
 TOM HE WENT TO THE SOAP-KETTLE AND SEARCHED AROUND AND FETCHED BACK THE IRON THING THEY LIFT THE LID WITH
THE SKIFF WAS HALF FULL OF PLUNDER WHICH THAT GANG HAD STOLE THERE ON THE WRECK
 THE BANK WAS CAVED AWAY UNDER ONE CORNER OF SOME OTHERS AND THAT CORNER WAS HANGING OVER
 WELL I FELT BETTER RIGHT OFF
AND IF THE TESTAMENT IS WHERE I HAD IT I'LL KNOW I DIDN'T PUT IT IN AND THAT WILL SHOW THAT I LAID THE TESTAMENT DOWN AND TOOK UP THE SPOON AND OH FOR THE LAND'S SAKE
 NO YOU AIN DEAD
AND ALL OVER THE WALLS WAS THE IGNORANTEST KIND OF WORDS AND PICTURES MADE WITH CHARCOAL
DON'T YOU PLAY NOTHING ON ME BECAUSE I WOULDN'T ON YOU
WENT RIGHT ON
THEY SAY TO A FELLOW I WISHT YOU'D LEN ME A CHAW JACK I JIST THIS MINUTE GIVE BEN THOMPSON THE LAST CHAW I HAD"WHICH IS A LIE PRETTY MUCH EVERYTIME
THE KING GOT OUT AN OLD RATTY DECK OF CARDS AFTER BREAKFAST AND HIM AND THE DUKE PLAYED SEVEN-UP A WHILE FIVE CENTS A GAME
BUT THEY TORE OPEN HIS SHIRT FIRST AND I SEEN WHERE ONE OF THE BULLETS WENT IN
 CONFOUND THESE OLE BRITCHES
HERE'S YOUR TWO SETS O HEIRS TO OLD PETER WILKSAND YOU PAYS YOUR MONEY AND YOU TAKES YOUR CHOICE CHAPTER XXIX
AND SO IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR THEY WAS AS THICK AS THIEVES AGAIN AND THE TIGHTER THEY GOT THE LOVINGER THEY GOT AND WENT OFF A-SNORING IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS
 WHAT'S THE TROUBLE I SAYS
 WHERE'S THE RAFT IT'S ALL RIGHT I SAYS
 BY AND BY I BEGIN TO HEAR GUNS A GOOD WAYS OFF
 SO SHE TOOK AND DUSTED US BOTH WITH THE HICKRY AND WE WAS AS MUCH AS TWO HOURS CATCHING ANOTHER FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN DRAT THAT MEDDLESOME CUB AND THEY WARN'T THE LIKELIEST NUTHER BECAUSE THE FIRST HAUL WAS THE PICK OF THE FLOCK
 BUT THIS TIME I FOUND SOMETHING AT LAST
OMINOUS PLANS.NEWS FROM JIM.OLD RECOLLECTIONS.A SHEEP STORY.VALUABLE INFORMATION
 IT'S WELL FOR YOU TO SET THERE AND BLUBBER LIKE A BABYIT'S FITTEN FOR YOU AFTER THE WAY YOU'VE ACTED
SAID THEY WAS UP TO SOME DEVILMENT OR OTHERWOULDN'T BE GONE LONG
AND SO BE HIS TRUE FRIEND AND LET HIM QUIT THE THING RIGHT WHERE HE WAS AND SAVE HIMSELF
SOME OF THE FENCES HAD BEEN WHITEWASHED SOME TIME OR ANOTHER BUT THE DUKE SAID IT WAS IN CLUMBUS'S TIME LIKE ENOUGH
I NEVER SEE ANYTHING SO LOVELY
 I WAS A-SAYIN'PASS THAT-AIR SASSER O M'LASSES WON'T YE?I WAS A-SAYIN TO SISTER DUNLAP JIST THIS MINUTE HOW DID THEY GIT THAT GRINDSTONE IN THERE S'I
 THEN I TOLD HER MY FATHER AND MOTHER WAS DEAD AND THE LAW HAD BOUND ME OUT TO A MEAN OLD FARMER IN THE COUNTRY THIRTY MILE BACK FROM THE RIVER AND HE TREATED ME SO BAD I COULDN'T STAND IT NO LONGER
BUT THE MINUTE WE TURNED THE CORNER AND WAS IN THE DARK HE SAYS
 BUT IT'S TOO BLAME SIMPLE
WHAT'S THIS IT'S SOMETHING THEY GIVE ME FOR LEARNING MY LESSONS GOOD HE TORE IT UP AND SAYS
 BUT I WARN'T COMFORTABLE LONG BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO THINK OF SOMETHING
 ONCE HE LOCKED ME IN AND WAS GONE THREE DAYS
 EVERYBODY YELLED AT HIM AND LAUGHED AT HIM AND SASSED HIM AND HE SASSED BACK AND SAID HE'D ATTEND TO THEM AND LAY THEM OUT IN THEIR REGULAR TURNS BUT HE COULDN'T WAIT NOW BECAUSE HE'D COME TO TOWN TO KILL OLD COLONEL SHERBURN AND HIS MOTTO WAS MEAT FIRST AND SPOON VITTLES TO TOP OFF ON HE SEE ME AND RODE UP AND SAYS
TOM HE MADE A SIGN TO MEKIND OF A LITTLE NOISE WITH HIS MOUTHAND WE WENT CREEPING AWAY ON OUR HANDS AND KNEES
SHE GRABBED ME AND HUGGED ME TIGHT
 THERE AIN'T A COWARD AMONGST THEM SHEPHERDSONSNOT A ONE
THEY'RE A COUPLE OF FRAUDSREGULAR DEAD-BEATS
BUT I DIDN HAVE NO LUCK
THE MAN THAT BOUGHT HIM IS NAMED ABRAM FOSTERABRAM G
BUT THE NEXT DAY I WENT EXPLORING AROUND DOWN THROUGH THE ISLAND
DEED SHE HAS
THE LAST SHIRT.MOONING AROUND.SAILING ORDERS.THE WITCH PIE
SAY WHEN A COW'S LAYING DOWN WHICH END OF HER GETS UP FIRST
 _HAIN'T YOU BEN GONE AWAY GONE AWAY
 MATILDA ANGELINA ARAMINTA PHELPS WHACK COMES THE THIMBLE AND THE CHILD SNATCHES HER CLAWS OUT OF THE SUGAR-BOWL WITHOUT FOOLING AROUND ANY
 SO ME AND THE DUKE WENT UP TO THE VILLAGE AND HUNTED AROUND THERE FOR THE KING AND BY AND BY WE FOUND HIM IN THE BACK ROOM OF A LITTLE LOW DOGGERY VERY TIGHT AND A LOT OF LOAFERS BULLYRAGGING HIM FOR SPORT AND HE A-CUSSING AND A-THREATENING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND SO TIGHT HE COULDN'T WALK AND COULDN'T DO NOTHING TO THEM
AND SHE SET THERE VERY IMPATIENT AND EXCITED AND HANDSOME BUT LOOKING KIND OF HAPPY AND EASED-UP LIKE A PERSON THAT'S HAD A TOOTH PULLED OUT
 WHO TOLD YOU YOU MIGHT MEDDLE WITH SUCH HIFALUT'N FOOLISHNESS HEY?WHO TOLD YOU YOU COULD THE WIDOW
I CAN'T IMITATE HIM AND SO I AIN'T A-GOING TO TRY TO
 IT SHOWS HOW A BODY CAN SEE AND DON'T SEE AT THE SAME TIME WELL THE NIGGER UNLOCKED THE PADLOCK WHEN HE WENT IN AND HE LOCKED IT AGAIN WHEN HE CAME OUT
AND YET HERE'S A CASE WHERE I'M BLEST IF IT DON'T LOOK TO ME LIKE THE TRUTH IS BETTER AND ACTULY SAFER THAN A LIE
S'POSE A MAN WAS TO COME TO YOU AND SAY POLLY-VOO-FRANZYWHAT WOULD YOU THINK I WOULDN THINK NUFF'N
 DEY WUZ SOMEBODY ROUN ALL DE TIME
 I WATCHED IT COME CREEPING DOWN AND WHEN IT WAS MOST ABREAST OF WHERE I STOOD I HEARD A MAN SAY STERN OARS THERE
YOU WANT TO WATER IT WITH YOUR TEARS
 AND I LET THEM STAY SAID
AND ON SUNDAYS HE WORE A BLUE TAIL-COAT WITH BRASS BUTTONS ON IT
 I SET THERE BEHIND A CLUMP OF BUSHES IN ABOUT SIX FOOT OF HIM AND KEPT MY EYES ON HIM STEADY
 AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
 WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME NOW GEORGE PETERS MUM WELL TRY TO REMEMBER IT GEORGE
WELL IT AIN'T NO USE TO SEND THINGS BY HIM NO MORE HE AIN'T RELIABLE THEN HE SAYS
THAT'S MY OPINION TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT IT MAYN'T BE NO COUNT S'I BUT SICH AS T IS IT'S MY OPINION S'I N IF ANY BODY K'N START A BETTER ONE S'I LET HIM DO IT S'I THAT'S ALL
MAYBE HE LIES AND SAYS HE AIN'T GOT NONE
BUT LUCK DIDN'T RUN MY WAY
EN DIDN'T I BUST UP AGIN A LOT ER DEM ISLANDS EN HAVE A TURRIBLE TIME EN MOS GIT DROWNDED
SO HE HAD CLUMB IN BY THE SHED
 THEY WOULDN'T TOOK ANY MONEY FOR HER
CHAPTER XXXI

CHAPTER XL
AND I SAYS I'LL GO AND WRITE THE LETTERAND THEN SEE IF I CAN PRAY
 SHET DE DO SHE JIS STOOD DE SAME WAY KINER SMILIN UP
 HOW FUR IS IT A LITTLE SHORT OF FOUR MILESRIGHT OUT IN THE COUNTRY BACK HERE WELL THAT LL ANSWER
 I DON'T K'YER NOTH'N BOUT THATIT'S THE COUNT I'M THINKIN ABOUT
 JIM HITCHED IT BEHIND WITH THE HOOKS AND IT WAS A FAIR FIT
 WE HADN'T ROBBED NOBODY HADN'T KILLED ANY PEOPLE BUT ONLY JUST PRETENDED
 I NEVER KNOWED HOW CLOTHES COULD CHANGE A BODY BEFORE
 DEY'S AWLUZ AT IT SAH EN DEY DO MOS KILL ME DEY SK'YERS ME SO
THAT DISTURBED JIMAND ME TOO
 I CLEANED OUT THE PLACE
 HE TOLD ME TO MAKE MYSELF EASY AND AT HOME AND TELL ALL ABOUT MYSELF
BUT EVERYBODY SAID IT WAS A GOOD SERMON AND THEY ALL TALKED IT OVER GOING HOME AND HAD SUCH A POWERFUL LOT TO SAY ABOUT FAITH AND GOOD WORKS AND FREE GRACE AND PREFOREORDESTINATION AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THAT IT DID SEEM TO ME TO BE ONE OF THE ROUGHEST SUNDAYS I HAD RUN ACROSS YET
 HE HAD FORGOT ME AND EVERYTHING ELSE
 EN WHAT USE IS A HALF A CHILE
SO THE KING TOLD US TO BOTH STAY ON WATCH TILL THE WEATHER GOT BETTER
 BUT THEY WAS ALL LOCKED AND CHAINED
THAT DIDN'T HELP ME MUCH THOUGH
 THE KING SAID TAKE IT ALL AROUND IT LAID OVER ANY DAY HE'D EVER PUT IN IN THE MISSIONARYING LINE
TOM SAID HE'D GOT TO
 THEY CALL THAT A GOVMENT THAT CAN'T SELL A FREE NIGGER TILL HE'S BEEN IN THE STATE SIX MONTHS
THE THING'S AWFUL MIXED NOW
 JIM CAN DO THAT
 I CAN'T GIVE THE OLD GENT'S WORDS NOR I CAN'T IMITATE HIM
WHY SAID HE A MAGICIAN COULD CALL UP A LOT OF GENIES AND THEY WOULD HASH YOU UP LIKE NOTHING BEFORE YOU COULD SAY JACK ROBINSON
 WE AIN'T A-GOING TO GNAW HIM OUT ARE WE AIN'T THEM OLD CRIPPLED PICKS AND THINGS IN THERE GOOD ENOUGH TO DIG A NIGGER OUT WITH  I SAYS
 IT WAS JACK-O'-LANTERNS OR LIGHTNING BUGS
 THEY SHA'N'T TOUCH A HAIR OF YOUR HEAD SHE SAYS AND I SEE HER NOSTRILS SPREAD AND HER EYES SNAP WHEN SHE SAID IT TOO
PRAY FOR ME
I'S SEED M BEFO

 FOR IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THAT THEY'D A JAILED US TILL THEM ENGLISHMEN'S BAGGAGE COMEAND THENTHE PENITENTIARY YOU BET
SWORD EXERCISE.HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY.THEY LOAFED AROUND TOWN.A LAZY TOWN.OLD BOGGS.DEAD

SHE DONE BROKE LOOSE EN GONE IEN HERE WE IS CHAPTER XIII
NONE OF YOUR FLABBY TOUGH MEAT THAT'S LAID IN A CUPBOARD IN A DAMP CELLAR ALL NIGHT AND TASTES LIKE A HUNK OF OLD COLD CANNIBAL IN THE MORNING
 THERE JIM LAID SOUND ASLEEP ON THE GROUND
 I WAS GLAD OF THAT
NO NOT TILL YOU'VE ASKED ME FIRST SO SHE DIDN'T LOSE NO TIME BUT ASKED HIM
 THEN WHEN WE HAD GOT PRETTY WELL STUFFED WE LAID OFF AND LAZIED
THERE WAS A LITTLE ONE-HORSE TOWN ABOUT THREE MILE DOWN THE BEND AND AFTER DINNER THE DUKE SAID HE HAD CIPHERED OUT HIS IDEA ABOUT HOW TO RUN IN DAYLIGHT WITHOUT IT BEING DANGERSOME FOR JIM
IF YOU ARE HARVEY WILKS WHEN'D YOU COME TO THIS TOWN THE DAY BEFORE THE FUNERAL FRIEND SAYS THE KING
THEY'RE YOUNG AND SPRY AND K'N EASY EARN A LIVIN  _THEY AIN'T A-GOIN TO SUFFER
 THE STREETS WAS FULL AND EVERYBODY WAS EXCITED
THEY DON'T HAVE NO LESS THAN SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN
 SHE SAID IT WAS WICKED TO SAY WHAT I SAID
 TOM SAID IT WAS A GOOD IDEA SO HE TOOK A PENCIL AND WROTE IT IN
BUT LAW SAKES I DON'T CARE FOR THAT I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU
 I HAIN'T EVER HEARN ER SICH A THING B'FO WELL THEN I'LL HAVE TO MAKE IT MYSELF WILL YOU DO IT HONEY?WILL YOU
 _THAT WARN'T THE PLAN NO IT WARN'T

OH WHAT A TURN YOU DID GIVE ME
 SAY HOW MUCH YOU GOT IN YOUR POCKET
BUT TOMORROW WE WANT ALL TO COMEEVERYBODY
BUT RIGHT AWAY AFTER I SEE I WARN'T SCARED OF HIM WORTH BOTHRING ABOUT
 WE TURNED IT OVER AND OVER AND AT LAST WE MADE UP OUR MINDS THEY WAS GOING TO BREAK INTO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE OR STORE OR WAS GOING INTO THE COUNTERFEIT-MONEY BUSINESS OR SOMETHING
 YES JUST AS THAT MAN HAS GOT THAT SON RAISED AT LAST AND READY TO GO TO WORK AND BEGIN TO DO SUTHIN FOR HIM AND GIVE HIM A REST THE LAW UP AND GOES FOR HIM
 AND SO HE WAS
 THE NEXT TIME IT COME I SEE I WARN'T HEADING FOR IT BUT HEADING AWAY TO THE RIGHT OF IT
WHY CAN'T A BODY TAKE A CLUB AND RANSOM THEM AS SOON AS THEY GET HERE BECAUSE IT AIN'T IN THE BOOKS SOTHAT'S WHY
 LOOK AT THAT SHIRTEVERY LAST INCH OF IT KIVERED OVER WITH SECRET AFRICAN WRIT'N DONE WITH BLOOD
BUT I CAN'T SOMEHOW SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IT NO WAY
 NOT A LIE IN IT SAYS I
 "HEAR HIM BEG
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE
 BUT STILL I'M JIST AS ABLE TO BE SORRY FOR MR WILKS FOR NOT ARRIVING IN TIME ALL THE SAME IF HE'S MISSED ANYTHING BY ITWHICH I HOPE HE HASN'T WELL HE DON'T MISS ANY PROPERTY BY IT BECAUSE HE'LL GET THAT ALL RIGHT
IT WOULDN'T DO AT ALL
SHE WAS GOING TO LIVE SO AS TO GO TO THE GOOD PLACE
IT WAS AFTER SUN-UP NOW BUT WE WENT RIGHT ON AND DIDN'T TIE UP
GOOD LAND  I SAYS
 BOUN TO GIT YO MONEY BACK A HUND'D TIMES DE PREACHER SAYS
AND THEN PRETTY SOON THE FERRYBOAT GIVE IT UP AND WENT FOR THE SHORE AND I LAID INTO MY WORK AND WENT A-BOOMING DOWN THE RIVER
 YOU NEVER KNOWED A SOUND DODGE AROUND SO AND SWAP PLACES SO QUICK AND SO MUCH
 IT'S WHAT MAKES ME SO LATE
 WELL BALUM HE TUCK DE MONEY EN WHEN HE WUZ IN CHURCH HE HEAR DE PREACHER SAY DAT WHOEVER GIVE TO DE PO LEN TO DE LORD EN BOUN TO GIT HIS MONEY BACK A HUND'D TIMES
AND WHEN TOM'S DONE WITH HIM WE'LL GIVE HIM WHAT IT'S WORTH OR ALL WE GOT AND THEN LET HIM GET ASHORE
 SHE SAYS
 SHE SAYS
 SHE SAYS
 SHE SAYS
 SHE SAYS
 SHE SAYS
 IT'S A-COMIN  MIND I TELL YOU IT'S A-COMIN IT DID COME TOO
 THE WOODS WAS FULL OF TEAMS AND WAGONS HITCHED EVERYWHERES FEEDING OUT OF THE WAGON-TROUGHS AND STOMPING TO KEEP OFF THE FLIES
 WELL THEN THE OLD THING COMMENCED AGAIN
 I SAYS TO THE PEOPLE WHY AIN'T THIS NIGGER PUT UP AT AUCTION AND SOLD?THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
 I GOT EVERYTHING INTO THE CANOE AS QUICK AS I COULD AND THEN WENT CREEPING THROUGH THE WOODS TO SEE WHAT I COULD FIND OUT
 SOMETIMES IT'S DONE ONE WAY SOMETIMES ANOTHER
SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW SHE WAS EVER GOING TO BE HAPPY THERE KNOWING THE MOTHER AND THE CHILDREN WARN'T EVER GOING TO SEE EACH OTHER NO MOREAND THEN BUSTED OUT BITTERER THAN EVER AND FLUNG UP HER HANDS AND SAYS
THEN WE STRUCK OUT EASY AND COMFORTABLE FOR THE ISLAND WHERE MY RAFT WAS
 JIM SAID HE DIDN'T BELIEVE HE COULD GO ANY FURTHERSO SCARED HE HADN'T HARDLY ANY STRENGTH LEFT HE SAID
AND CHAWING TOBACCO AND GAPING AND YAWNING AND STRETCHINGA MIGHTY ORNERY LOT
JULIET'S IN A BALCONY ENJOYING THE MOONLIGHT BEFORE SHE GOES TO BED AND SHE'S GOT ON HER NIGHT-GOWN AND HER RUFFLED NIGHTCAP
 I COULD SHOW HER NOW THAT I WARN'T TO BLAME ON ACCOUNT OF THE RATS
I'LL GO AND STUFF THE STRAW INTO JIM'S CLOTHES TO REPRESENT HIS MOTHER IN DISGUISE AND BE READY TO BAA LIKE A SHEEP AND SHOVE SOON AS YOU GET THERE SO OUT HE WENT AND DOWN CELLAR WENT I
WHAT ALL OF THEM NOLEASTWAYS NOT ALL AT ONCETHAT IS I DON'T THINK I EVER SEE THEM ALL COME OUT AT ONCE BUT JUST ONE TIME HELLO
 BEFORE NIGHT THEY WANTED TO LYNCH HIM BUT HE WAS GONE YOU SEE
WHAT DO DEY STAN FOR
 WE'LL DO THAT TOO BUT LOOKY HERE TOM WHAT DO WE WANT TO WARN ANYBODY FOR THAT SOMETHING'S UP
 I TOLD JIM ALL ABOUT THE TIME I HAD JABBERING WITH THAT WOMAN
 HIS FOREHEAD WAS HIGH AND HIS HAIR WAS BLACK AND STRAIGHT AND HUNG TO HIS SHOULDERS
 YOUR MOTHER COULDN'T READ AND SHE COULDN'T WRITE NUTHER BEFORE SHE DIED
AND THEN WE WAS DOG-TIRED AND OUR HANDS WAS BLISTERED AND YET YOU COULDN'T SEE WE'D DONE ANYTHING HARDLY
NEXT HE BEGUN TO SNOREAND THEN I WAS PRETTY SOON COMFORTABLE AGAIN
 SO NEXT MORNING HE GOT SOME BIG SHEETS OF WRAPPING PAPER AND SOME BLACK PAINT AND DRAWED OFF SOME HANDBILLS AND STUCK THEM UP ALL OVER THE VILLAGE
 GIMME A CASE-KNIFE HE HAD HIS OWN BY HIM BUT I HANDED HIM MINE
I JUDGED THAT THAT PIECE OF PAPER MEANT THAT MISS SOPHIA WAS TO MEET HARNEY SOMEWHERES AT HALF-PAST TWO AND RUN OFF
I WAS TRYING TO DO FOR THE BEST IN SELLIN EM OUT SO QUICK
 HE HASN'T HAD ANY TOO MUCH TIMEAND BESIDES HE MIGHTN'T A GOT THE LETTER AT ALL YOU KNOW TOO BAD TOO BAD HE COULDN'T A LIVED TO SEE HIS BROTHERS POOR SOUL
THE LIGHTNING ROD.HIS LEVEL BEST.A BEQUEST TO POSTERITY.A HIGH FIGURE
HE COULDN'T HELP IT
 THAT WAS ALWAYS HIS WORD
IT WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE SHANTY AND I THOUGHT I HEARD THE OLD MAN COMING ALL THE TIME
 BUT OF COURSE I FORGOT ALL ABOUT DRIVING SLOW ON ACCOUNTS OF BEING GLAD AND FULL OF THINKING
 I LANDED AND SLOPPED THROUGH THE TIMBER AND UP THE RIDGE AND INTO THE CAVERN
NOW I CAN HAVE A GOOD LOOK AT YOU
WELL I WONDER
SO WE WAS PRETTY GLAD WHEN THE DUKE SAYS
 TOM SAID SHE WAS GOING TO GET ONE OF US SURE BEFORE WE GOT THROUGH
WE FIXED UP A SHORT FORKED STICK TO HANG THE OLD LANTERN ON BECAUSE WE MUST ALWAYS LIGHT THE LANTERN WHENEVER WE SEE A STEAMBOAT COMING DOWN-STREAM TO KEEP FROM GETTING RUN OVER
BUT TOM SAID HE WOULD BLOCK THEM OUT FOR HIM AND THEN HE WOULDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT JUST FOLLOW THE LINES
BUT HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT NO MORE ADVENTURES
 IT WAS A DREADFUL THING TO SEE
 NOW YOU KNOW HE AIN'T
I ASKED HER TO LET ME THINK A MINUTE
AND WE LIKE TO GOT A HORNET'S NEST BUT WE DIDN'T
DAH YOU GOES DE OLE TRUE HUCK
THIS IS WHAT SHE WROTE ABOUT A BOY BY THE NAME OF STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS THAT FELL DOWN A WELL AND WAS DROWNDED
AND EVERY TIME ONE OF THEM FLOPPED DOWN ON HER IT DIDN'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE WHAT SHE WAS DOING SHE WOULD JUST LAY THAT WORK DOWN AND LIGHT OUT
 BUT I BET SHE DONE IT JUST THE SAMESHE WAS JUST THAT KIND
 WHY THEY CAN'T COLLECT THE MONEY FOR THE NIGGERS YETTHEY'RE IN THE WORST KIND OF A FIX MISS MARY WELL SHE SAYS I'LL RUN DOWN TO BREAKFAST NOW AND THEN I'LL START STRAIGHT FOR MR LOTHROP'S DEED THAT AIN'T THE TICKET MISS MARY JANE I SAYS BY NO MANNER OF MEANS
NOW OLD JIM YOU'RE A FREE MAN AGAIN AND I BET YOU WON'T EVER BE A SLAVE NO MORE EN A MIGHTY GOOD JOB IT WUZ TOO HUCK
 IS A FRENCHMAN A MAN YES WELL DEN
WHEN IT WAS DARK I SET BY MY CAMP FIRE SMOKING AND FEELING PRETTY WELL SATISFIED
AND THEN FASTER AND FASTER THEY WENT ALL OF THEM DANCING FIRST ONE FOOT OUT IN THE AIR AND THEN THE OTHER THE HORSES LEANING MORE AND MORE AND THE RINGMASTER GOING ROUND AND ROUND THE CENTER-POLE CRACKING HIS WHIP AND SHOUTING HI!HI AND THE CLOWN CRACKING JOKES BEHIND HIM
 NOW CLER OUT TO BED AND DON'T LEMME SEE NO MORE OF YOU TILL MORNING I WAS UP STAIRS IN A SECOND AND DOWN THE LIGHTNING-ROD IN ANOTHER ONE AND SHINNING THROUGH THE DARK FOR THE LEAN-TO
 WHEN LOUIS XVI
WHILE WE LAID OFF AFTER BREAKFAST TO SLEEP UP BOTH OF US BEING ABOUT WORE OUT I GOT TO THINKING THAT IF I COULD FIX UP SOME WAY TO KEEP PAP AND THE WIDOW FROM TRYING TO FOLLOW ME IT WOULD BE A CERTAINER THING THAN TRUSTING TO LUCK TO GET FAR ENOUGH OFF BEFORE THEY MISSED ME
 THEY ALWAYS MAKE THEIR PENS OUT OF THE HARDEST TOUGHEST TROUBLESOMEST PIECE OF OLD BRASS CANDLESTICK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON
AND THEN I OUT AND LOOKED AROUND A BUNCH OF WILLOWS AND THERE WAS THE OLD MAN DOWN THE PATH A PIECE JUST DRAWING A BEAD ON A BIRD WITH HIS GUN
AND SO OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO BUT HOW CAN WE DO IT IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS WHY BLAME IT ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO IT
GOING TO ORLEANS GIT ABOARD SAYS THE KING
 DON'T YOU LET ON YOU'RE HERE
YOU JUST MARCH INTO THAT SETTING-ROOM AND STAY THERE TILL I COME
THER'S BEN A DOZEN A-HELPIN THAT NIGGER N I LAY I'D SKIN EVERY LAST NIGGER ON THIS PLACE BUT I'D FIND OUT WHO DONE IT S'I
 THEN THE OLD MAN GOT TO CUSSING AND CUSSED EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY HE COULD THINK OF AND THEN CUSSED THEM ALL OVER AGAIN TO MAKE SURE HE HADN'T SKIPPED ANY AND AFTER THAT HE POLISHED OFF WITH A KIND OF A GENERAL CUSS ALL ROUND INCLUDING A CONSIDERABLE PARCEL OF PEOPLE WHICH HE DIDN'T KNOW THE NAMES OF AND SO CALLED THEM WHAT'S-HIS-NAME WHEN HE GOT TO THEM AND WENT RIGHT ALONG WITH HIS CUSSING
TIS MY FATE TO BE ALWAYS GROUND INTO THE MIRE UNDER THE IRON HEEL OF OPPRESSION
 I HAIN'T SEEN NO FOG NOR NO ISLANDS NOR NO TROUBLES NOR NOTHING
 I KNOWED DEY WAS ARTER YOU
 WHY JIM IS HE STOPPED AND WENT TO STUDYING
ESCAPING FROM THE WRECK.THE WATCHMAN.SINKING
AND SHE COULDN'T SEEM TO HUG AND SHAKE ENOUGH AND KEPT SAYING YOU DON'T LOOK AS MUCH LIKE YOUR MOTHER AS I RECKONED YOU WOULD
 SO IT WAS YOU YOU LITTLE RAPSCALLIONS THAT'S BEEN MAKING ALL THIS TROUBLE AND TURNED EVERYBODY'S WITS CLEAN INSIDE OUT AND SCARED US ALL MOST TO DEATH
CHAPTER THE LAST THE FIRST TIME I CATCHED TOM PRIVATE I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS HIS IDEA TIME OF THE EVASION?WHAT IT WAS HE'D PLANNED TO DO IF THE EVASION WORKED ALL RIGHT AND HE MANAGED TO SET A NIGGER FREE THAT WAS ALREADY FREE BEFORE
BUT STEAD OF THAT I WILL BAA LIKE A SHEEP SOON AS THEY GET IN AND NOT BLOW AT ALL
 BUT SHE SAID SHE'D SET UP FOR HIM A WHILE ANYWAY AND KEEP A LIGHT BURNING SO HE COULD SEE IT
BUT WHO ARE WE GOING TO ROB?HOUSES OR CATTLE OR STUFF
 BUT IT DIDN'T DO NO GOOD
WHY LAWSAMERCY IT'S MOST NIGHT AND SID NOT COME YET
AND THAT WAS HOW I COME TO BE HERE
BUT IT'S GONE THAT'S THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT AND YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO CHANGE TO A RED FLANN'L ONE TILL I CAN GET TIME TO MAKE A NEW ONE
 AND THEY CALL IT THE MUMPS THAT'S WHAT MISS MARY JANE SAID WELL WHAT IN THE NATION DO THEY CALL IT THE MUMPS FOR WHY BECAUSE IT IS THE MUMPS

 "THE FIRST GOOD TOWN WE COME TO WE'LL HIRE A HALL AND DO THE SWORD FIGHT IN RICHARD III
 I LISTENED
BY THE ILLUSTRIOUS KEAN
IS DAT MAN GWYNE TO BE WASEFUL O CHILLEN
HE KETCHED THIS PIECE OF A RAFT
TIS A CONSUMMATION DEVOUTLY TO BE WISHED
COME RIGHT IN OH DO SAYS AUNT SALLY
 WE BEGUN TO COME TO TREES WITH SPANISH MOSS ON THEM HANGING DOWN FROM THE LIMBS LIKE LONG GRAY BEARDS
 BUT HE STUDIED IT OVER AND THEN SAID JIM WOULD HAVE TO WORRY ALONG THE BEST HE COULD WITH AN ONION
OH WELL THAT'S ALL INTERPRETED WELL ENOUGH AS FAR AS IT GOES JIM I SAYS
 IT AIN'T NO SLOUCH OF A NAME TO SPELLRIGHT OFF WITHOUT STUDYING I SET IT DOWN PRIVATE BECAUSE SOMEBODY MIGHT WANT ME TO SPELL IT NEXT AND SO I WANTED TO BE HANDY WITH IT AND RATTLE IT OFF LIKE I WAS USED TO IT
 TOM AND ME WAS TO SLEEP IN THE SAME ROOM AND BED
 AND HOW FAR A BODY CAN HEAR ON THE WATER SUCH NIGHTS
 NIGGERS IS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT WITCHES IN THE DARK BY THE KITCHEN FIRE
THAT WAS ALL FIXED
STAND RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE
 I GIVE HER A TURN WITH THE PADDLE AND BRUNG HER NOSE TO SHORE
 I SAID JIM MIGHT WAKE UP AND COME
AND YET NEVER A SKIFF COME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR ME TO HAIL
 WELL SHE WAS IN A TEARING WAYJUST A-TREMBLING ALL OVER SHE WAS SO MAD
I WENT ALONG UP THE BANK WITH ONE EYE OUT FOR PAP AND T'OTHER ONE OUT FOR WHAT THE RISE MIGHT FETCH ALONG
 HE USED TO ALWAYS WHALE ME WHEN HE WAS SOBER AND COULD GET HIS HANDS ON ME
WHEN WE GOT HER OUT TO ABOUT THE MIDDLE WE LET HER ALONE AND LET HER FLOAT WHEREVER THE CURRENT WANTED HER TO
WE HAD JIM OUT OF THE CHAINS IN NO TIME AND WHEN AUNT POLLY AND UNCLE SILAS AND AUNT SALLY FOUND OUT HOW GOOD HE HELPED THE DOCTOR NURSE TOM THEY MADE A HEAP OF FUSS OVER HIM AND FIXED HIM UP PRIME AND GIVE HIM ALL HE WANTED TO EAT AND A GOOD TIME AND NOTHING TO DO
 SOME OF THEM GETS ON THE POLICE AND SOME OF THEM LEARNS PEOPLE HOW TO TALK FRENCH WHY HUCK DOAN DE FRENCH PEOPLE TALK DE SAME WAY WE DOES NO JIM
 BUT AFTER HE GOT UP HALF WAY ABOUT THREE TIMES AND MISSED FIRE AND FELL EVERY TIME AND THE LAST TIME MOST BUSTED HIS BRAINS OUT HE THOUGHT HE'D GOT TO GIVE IT UP
 BUT ANYWAY IT ALL COME OF LOOKING AT THE MOON THAT WAY LIKE A FOOL
SO I WILTED RIGHT DOWN ON TO THE PLANKS THEN AND GIVE UP
 HE DRESSED JIM UP IN KING LEAR'S OUTFITIT WAS A LONG CURTAIN-CALICO GOWN AND A WHITE HORSE-HAIR WIG AND WHISKERS
BENCH BY THE KITCHEN DOOR WITH BUCKET OF WATER AND A GOURD
SO I SHOVED ON BY
IT WAS THE BLESSEDEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO HIM BECAUSE HE WAS A CHANGED MAN NOW AND HAPPY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE
 SO I TIPTOED ALONG AND GOT DOWN STAIRS ALL RIGHT
GIMME A CASE-KNIFE I DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHAT TO DOBUT THEN I THOUGHT
4
 I CRAWLED INTO THE WIGWAM BUT THE KING AND THE DUKE HAD THEIR LEGS SPRAWLED AROUND SO THERE WARN'T NO SHOW FOR ME
NEXT DAY TOM STOLE A PEWTER SPOON AND A BRASS CANDLESTICK IN THE HOUSE FOR TO MAKE SOME PENS FOR JIM OUT OF AND SIX TALLOW CANDLES
 IT'S LIKE PICKING UP MONEY OUT'N THE ROAD YES IT ISAND I COULD A HAD IT IF I'D BEEN BIG ENOUGH
 TWO MONTHS OR MORE RUN ALONG AND MY CLOTHES GOT TO BE ALL RAGS AND DIRT AND I DIDN'T SEE HOW I'D EVER GOT TO LIKE IT SO WELL AT THE WIDOW'S WHERE YOU HAD TO WASH AND EAT ON A PLATE AND COMB UP AND GO TO BED AND GET UP REGULAR AND BE FOREVER BOTHERING OVER A BOOK AND HAVE OLD MISS WATSON PECKING AT YOU ALL THE TIME
WE STRUCK IT MIGHTY LUCKY
I WENT INTO THE WIGWAM
 IT WAS MOST PESKY TEDIOUS HARD WORK AND SLOW AND DIDN'T GIVE MY HANDS NO SHOW TO GET WELL OF THE SORES AND WE DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE NO HEADWAY HARDLY
 THERE COULDN'T ANYTHING WAKE THEM UP ALL OVER AND MAKE THEM HAPPY ALL OVER LIKE A DOG FIGHTUNLESS IT MIGHT BE PUTTING TURPENTINE ON A STRAY DOG AND SETTING FIRE TO HIM OR TYING A TIN PAN TO HIS TAIL AND SEE HIM RUN HIMSELF TO DEATH
 ANYBODY WOULD WHAT WAS THE TROUBLE ABOUT BUCK?LAND I RECKON MAYBEI DON'T KNOW WELL WHO DONE THE SHOOTING
BUT WHEN HE STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP LIKE A LIBERTY-POLE AND THE LIGHTNING BEGUN TO FLICKER OUT FROM UNDER HIS EYEBROWS YOU WANTED TO CLIMB A TREE FIRST AND FIND OUT WHAT THE MATTER WAS AFTERWARDS
 I KNOW PERFECTLY WELL I TOOK IT OFF BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU HAIN'T GOT BUT ONE ON
 WE JUDGED THEY WAS STUDYING UP SOME KIND OF WORSE DEVILTRY THAN EVER
BUT HE GOT BACK TO-DAY AND I TOLD HIM AS SOON AS HE GOT HERE TWO HOURS AGO I HAD GOT SO UNEASY I COULDN'T SET STILL
BECAUSE OF COURSE SHE PROB'BLY HAIN'T GOT ANY BUT THAT ONE I KNOW
SO I TRIED TO SWEAT OUT A VERSE OR TWO MYSELF BUT I COULDN'T SEEM TO MAKE IT GO SOMEHOW
 BUT THERE'S ONE THING ANYWAYJIM'S TOO OLD TO BE DUG OUT WITH A CASE-KNIFE
I WOULDN'T STRAIN MYSELF IF I WAS YOU
ONLY HE SAYS YOU MUSTN'T BELLOW OUT ROMEO
AND I WISHED I COULD DO SOMETHING FOR HER BUT I COULDN'T ONLY TO SWEAR THAT I WOULDN'T NEVER DO NOTHING TO GRIEVE HER ANY MORE
JACKSON'S ISLAND IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
 I WAS GLAD ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I WANTED HIM AND ME TO BE TOGETHER
 WHY IT'S PERFECTLY RIDICULOUS WELL ALL RIGHT TOM FIX IT YOUR OWN WAY
 AS I WENT BY I SEE IT WAS A LANTERN HANGING ON THE JACKSTAFF OF A DOUBLE-HULL FERRYBOAT
AND WHEN WE GOT TO THE VILLAGE THEY YAWLED US ASHORE
 YOU BET I'D WAIT IF IT WAS SEVEN YEAR THAT'S ME EVERY TIME SAYS I
BUT WHAT I SAY IS THIS
 I KILLED HIM AND CURLED HIM UP ON THE FOOT OF JIM'S BLANKET EVER SO NATURAL THINKING THERE'D BE SOME FUN WHEN JIM FOUND HIM THERE
 WHAT MAKES THEM COME HERE JUST AT THIS RUNAWAY NIGGER'S BREAKFAST-TIME
FOR I COULDN'T REST EASY TILL I COULD SEE THE FERRYBOAT START
JUDGE THATCHER SURPRISED JIM LISTENING PAP HUCK AND HIS FATHER REFORMING THE DRUNKARD FALLING FROM GRACE THE WIDOWS MOSES AND THE BULRUSHERS MISS WATSON HUCK STEALING AWAY THEY TIP-TOED ALONG JIM TOM SAWYER'S BAND OF ROBBERS   HUCK CREEPS INTO HIS WINDOW MISS WATSON'S LECTURE THE ROBBERS DISPERSED RUBBING THE LAMP
SO I LAID THERE ABOUT AN HOUR TRYING TO THINK AND WHEN BUCK WAKED UP I SAYS
 I HAD TO ACCOUNT FOR THINGS SOME WAY SO I SAYS
 I MADE A KIND OF A TENT OUT OF MY BLANKETS TO PUT MY THINGS UNDER SO THE RAIN COULDN'T GET AT THEM
THEREYOU'VE HEARD WHAT HE SAID
AND HOW HE EVER COULD THINK OF SO MANY OF THEM AND SO SUDDEN AND SO PAT WAS WHAT I COULDN'T NOWAY UNDERSTAND
WHY MARS TOM I HAIN'T GOT NO COAT O ARM
 I COULDN'T SEE THEM BUT I COULD TELL WHERE THEY WAS BY THE WHISKY THEY'D BEEN HAVING
 WELL AFTER DINNER FRIDAY WE WAS LAYING AROUND IN THE GRASS AT THE UPPER END OF THE RIDGE AND GOT OUT OF TOBACCO
AND IF IT'S ANY OBJECT I DON'T MIND LETTING ON WE WAS AT IT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEAR
SEEIN HOW I'M DRESSED I RECKON MAYBE I BETTER ARRIVE DOWN FROM ST LOUIS OR CINCINNATI OR SOME OTHER BIG PLACE
 I SEE HIM THERE
 FAMILIES FETCHED THEIR DINNERS WITH THEM FROM THE COUNTRY AND EAT THEM IN THE WAGONS
 WE WENT WINDING IN AND OUT AMONGST THE TREES AND SOMETIMES THE VINES HUNG SO THICK WE HAD TO BACK AWAY AND GO SOME OTHER WAY
AND HE HAD A COUPLE OF BIG CARPET-BAGS BY HIM
ALSO
ALSO
 I HOPPED UP AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT AT A HOLE IN THE LEAVES AND I SEE A BUNCH OF SMOKE LAYING ON THE WATER A LONG WAYS UPABOUT ABREAST THE FERRY
 I HAD IT OUT OF THERE BEFORE THEY WAS HALF-WAY DOWN STAIRS
SO'LL MY OLD MAN IF YOU WANT HIM TO
AND I KNEW THEY'D LAY FOR US THE THIRD NIGHT AND CONSIDER IT WAS THEIR TURN NOW
 THEN THE KING SAYS I KNOWED IT
 HE CARRIED A MAHOGANY CANE WITH A SILVER HEAD TO IT
THE NEWS WAS ALL OVER TOWN IN TWO MINUTES AND YOU COULD SEE THE PEOPLE TEARING DOWN ON THE RUN FROM EVERY WHICH WAY SOME OF THEM PUTTING ON THEIR COATS AS THEY COME
AND EVERY WOMAN NEARLY WENT UP TO THE GIRLS WITHOUT SAYING A WORD AND KISSED THEM SOLEMN ON THE FOREHEAD AND THEN PUT THEIR HAND ON THEIR HEAD AND LOOKED UP TOWARDS THE SKY WITH THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN AND THEN BUSTED OUT AND WENT OFF SOBBING AND SWABBING AND GIVE THE NEXT WOMAN A SHOW
 CAN'T YOU THINK OF NO WAY YES I SAYS BUT I RECKON IT AIN'T REGULAR
 HOW DO DAT COME I DON'T KNOW
 DESE IS ALL I KIN STAN IT'S THE WAY I FEEL TOO JIM
AS SOON AS TOM WAS BACK WE CUT ALONG THE PATH AROUND THE GARDEN FENCE AND BY AND BY FETCHED UP ON THE STEEP TOP OF THE HILL THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE
YOU COULD SEE LITTLE DARK SPOTS DRIFTING ALONG EVER SO FAR AWAYTRADING SCOWS AND SUCH THINGS
THEN WE'RE ALL RIGHT YES SIR IT'S THE BEST WAY
HIS HANDS WAS LONG AND THIN AND EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE HE PUT ON A CLEAN SHIRT AND A FULL SUIT FROM HEAD TO FOOT MADE OUT OF LINEN SO WHITE IT HURT YOUR EYES TO LOOK AT IT
 THERE WAS A PLACE ON MY ANKLE THAT GOT TO ITCHING BUT I DASN'T SCRATCH IT
I WANTED TO GO AND LOOK AT A PLACE RIGHT ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE ISLAND THAT I'D FOUND WHEN I WAS EXPLORING
AND I HAD TO UP AND TELL HOW I WAS IN SUCH A TIGHT PLACE THAT WHEN MRS PHELPS TOOK ME FOR TOM SAWYERSHE CHIPPED IN AND SAYS OH GO ON AND CALL ME AUNT SALLY I'M USED TO IT NOW AND TAIN'T NO NEED TO CHANGE"THAT WHEN AUNT SALLY TOOK ME FOR TOM SAWYER I HAD TO STAND ITTHERE WARN'T NO OTHER WAY AND I KNOWED HE WOULDN'T MIND BECAUSE IT WOULD BE NUTS FOR HIM BEING A MYSTERY AND HE'D MAKE AN ADVENTURE OUT OF IT AND BE PERFECTLY SATISFIED
 I'LL JUST WALK UP AND DOWN A MINUTE AND SEE IF I CAN CALL IT BACK FROM RECOLLECTION'S VAULTS SO HE WENT TO MARCHING UP AND DOWN THINKING AND FROWNING HORRIBLE EVERY NOW AND THEN
 I NOTICED SOME PIECES OF LIMBS AND SUCH THINGS FLOATING DOWN AND A SPRINKLING OF BARK
SO THE OLD MAN HE GOT A LETTER OUT OF THE OFFICE AND WE WAITED AWHILE LONGER BUT SID DIDN'T COME
 OH YES YOU GOT A GUN
 WELL I SEE I WARN'T HURT THANKS TO GOODNESS
THEY DIDN'T HAVE NO BACKS
WHAT DO YOU RECKON'S THE MATTER WITH YOU ANYWAY
 BUT I SAID I DIDN'T
 THEY'VE GOT HIM BACK SAFE AND SOUND AND HE'S IN THAT CABIN AGAIN ON BREAD AND WATER AND LOADED DOWN WITH CHAINS TILL HE'S CLAIMED OR SOLD TOM ROSE SQUARE UP IN BED WITH HIS EYE HOT AND HIS NOSTRILS OPENING AND SHUTTING LIKE GILLS AND SINGS OUT TO ME
 HE WAS A-REELING ACROSS THE STREET TOWARDS ME BARE-HEADED WITH A FRIEND ON BOTH SIDES OF HIM A-HOLT OF HIS ARMS AND HURRYING HIM ALONG
WHEN I GOT DOWN OUT OF THE TREE I CREPT ALONG DOWN THE RIVER BANK A PIECE AND FOUND THE TWO BODIES LAYING IN THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND TUGGED AT THEM TILL I GOT THEM ASHORE
WE ALL GOT IN A BIG ROOM IN THE HOTEL AND LIT UP SOME CANDLES AND FETCHED IN THE NEW COUPLE
THE MOST CELEBRATED THING IN SHAKESPEARE
 I SAYS NOW I RECKON THE WIDOW OR THE PARSON OR SOMEBODY PRAYED THAT THIS BREAD WOULD FIND ME AND HERE IT HAS GONE AND DONE IT
 IT WAS A HANDSOME LOT OF QUALITY I TELL YOU
 WHY IF DEY WAS A RATTLESNAKE TO COME IN HEAH I'D TAKE EN BUST RIGHT OUT THOO DAT LOG WALL I WOULD WID MY HEAD WHY JIM YOU WOULDN'T BE AFRAID OF IT AFTER A LITTLE
THEN THE RINGMASTER HE SEE HOW HE HAD BEEN FOOLED AND HE WAS THE SICKEST RINGMASTER YOU EVER SEE I RECKON
I STARTED ACROSS TO THE TOWN FROM A LITTLE BELOW THE FERRY-LANDING AND THE DRIFT OF THE CURRENT FETCHED ME IN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TOWN
 IS YOUR MAN WHITE OR BLACK I DIDN'T ANSWER UP PROMPT
 I TUCKED THE MONEY-BAG IN UNDER THE LID JUST DOWN BEYOND WHERE HIS HANDS WAS CROSSED WHICH MADE ME CREEP THEY WAS SO COLD AND THEN I RUN BACK ACROSS THE ROOM AND IN BEHIND THE DOOR
 TOM HE LOOKED AT THE NIGGER STEADY AND KIND OF WONDERING AND SAYS
 I SHOT HEAD-FIRST OFF OF THE BANK LIKE A FROG CLOTHES AND ALL ON AND STRUCK OUT FOR THE CANOE
 IT WAS COOL IN THERE
 THEN SOMEBODY SINGS OUT TAKE UP A COLLECTION FOR HIM TAKE UP A COLLECTION  WELL A HALF A DOZEN MADE A JUMP TO DO IT BUT SOMEBODY SINGS OUT LET HIM PASS THE HAT AROUND  THEN EVERYBODY SAID IT THE PREACHER TOO
BUT I RECOLLECTED IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH LIKE THE KING TO LET ANYBODY ELSE TAKE CARE OF THAT MONEY BUT HIS OWN SELF
 AND HERE COMES THE WHITE WOMAN RUNNING FROM THE HOUSE ABOUT FORTY-FIVE OR FIFTY YEAR OLD BAREHEADED AND HER SPINNING-STICK IN HER HAND
 PAP ALWAYS SAID TAKE A CHICKEN WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T WANT HIM YOURSELF YOU CAN EASY FIND SOMEBODY THAT DOES AND A GOOD DEED AIN'T EVER FORGOT
 IT'S THE WAY THEY'VE ACTED FROM THE VERY STARTLEFT US TO DO EVERYTHING
 HE HAD BEEN DRUNK OVER IN TOWN AND LAID IN THE GUTTER ALL NIGHT AND HE WAS A SIGHT TO LOOK AT
AND THE WAY WE'VE FIXED IT THE SALE AIN'T GOING TO COUNT AND THEY AIN'T GOING TO GET NO MONEY
AND NOW THE KING PUT HIS'N ON AND HE TOLD ME TO PUT MINE ON
 "AND NOW YOU SEE WHAT YOU GOT BY IT
AND SOME HAD LINSEY-WOOLSEY FROCKS SOME GINGHAM ONES AND A FEW OF THE YOUNG ONES HAD ON CALICO
THEN SIGHS AGAIN AND SAYS
WELL THEM DOGS NEVER EVEN GOT ON THE TRACK OF M ONCE
 GRANGERFORD WAS VERY TALL AND VERY SLIM AND HAD A DARKISH-PALY COMPLEXION NOT A SIGN OF RED IN IT ANYWHERES
I REACHED FOR IT BUT IT WASN'T WHERE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
 GLORY BE TO GOODNESS WE'RE SHUT OF THEM JIM LIT OUT AND WAS A-COMING FOR ME WITH BOTH ARMS SPREAD HE WAS SO FULL OF JOY
 NOW WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I BEGUN TO WORRY ABOUT THE MENI RECKON I HADN'T HAD TIME TO BEFORE
AND THEN WHATEVER WE'VE PUT IN THE PAN DON'T YOU LET ON YOU SEE IT AT ALL
 BUT WE CAN'T FOOL ALONG
 THERE WAS A BIG FIREPLACE THAT WAS BRICKED ON THE BOTTOM AND THE BRICKS WAS KEPT CLEAN AND RED BY POURING WATER ON THEM AND SCRUBBING THEM WITH ANOTHER BRICK
HERE'S HUCK FINN HE HAIN'T GOT NO FAMILY
 I STUDIED A MINUTE SORT OF HOLDING MY BREATH AND THEN SAYS TO MYSELF
I WOULD COME
 BUT THE WORDS WOULDN'T COME
HE'S CRAZY S'I
 DON'T TALK LOUD HE WAS IN THE RIVER UNDER THE STERN OAR WITH JUST HIS NOSE OUT
BUT WHEN I GOT TO IT IT WARN'T NOTHING BUT A COUPLE OF SAWLOGS MADE FAST TOGETHER
 AND WE HAD HIM UP TO THE SICK-ROOM AND HAD A HIGH TALK
 GO LONG
WE SLEPT MOST ALL DAY AND STARTED OUT AT NIGHT A LITTLE WAYS BEHIND A MONSTROUS LONG RAFT THAT WAS AS LONG GOING BY AS A PROCESSION
AND JIM SAID YOU MUSTN'T COUNT THE THINGS YOU ARE GOING TO COOK FOR DINNER BECAUSE THAT WOULD BRING BAD LUCK
FOR HE COULD DO IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE BEING ACQUAINTED WITH ALL PIRATE CREWS IN THAT OCEAN
WELL ALL DAY HIM AND THE KING WAS HARD AT IT RIGGING UP A STAGE AND A CURTAIN AND A ROW OF CANDLES FOR FOOTLIGHTS
 I GOT SO DOWN-HEARTED AND SCARED I DID WISH I HAD SOME COMPANY
YOU'S DE BES FREN JIM'S EVER HAD
WELL LAST I PULLED OUT SOME OF MY HAIR AND BLOODED THE AXE GOOD AND STUCK IT ON THE BACK SIDE AND SLUNG THE AXE IN THE CORNER
 WHY I WROTE YOU TWICE TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU COULD MEAN BY SID BEING HERE WELL I NEVER GOT EM SIS AUNT POLLY SHE TURNS AROUND SLOW AND SEVERE AND SAYS
 WHERE WOULD I GO TO WELL LOOKY HERE BOSS DEY'S SUMF'N WRONG DEY IS
 HE HAD HIS CHIN IN HIS HAND THINKING
 AND THEY CALL THAT GOVMENT
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE BULGED OUT BIG AND SCARY WITH A LONG ROW OF WIDE-OPEN FURNACE DOORS SHINING LIKE RED-HOT TEETH AND HER MONSTROUS BOWS AND GUARDS HANGING RIGHT OVER US
TROUBLE HAS BRUNG THESE GRAY HAIRS AND THIS PREMATURE BALDITUDE
 S'E WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT SISTER HOTCHKISS S'E
AMEN COME LAME AND HALT AND BLIND
 ABOUT TWO THEY COME UP AGAIN THOUGH AND JIM WAS GOING TO CALL ME
 YOU FETCH THEM TO THE CAVE AND YOU'RE ALWAYS AS POLITE AS PIE TO THEM
AND WHEN HE TURNED BACK FROM THE WINDOW THERE SHE STOOD A-BEAMING AND A-SMILING LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE AND I STANDING PRETTY MEEK AND SWEATY ALONGSIDE
I MADE FAST AND LAID DOWN UNDER JIM'S NOSE ON THE RAFT AND BEGAN TO GAP AND STRETCH MY FISTS OUT AGAINST JIM AND SAYS
WE HEARD THEM COME ALONG TOWARDS THE CRICK BUT COULDN'T SEE THEM
 WHILE I WAS AT IT HE ASKED ME WHAT MY NAME WAS BUT BEFORE I COULD TELL HIM HE STARTED TO TELL ME ABOUT A BLUEJAY AND A YOUNG RABBIT HE HAD CATCHED IN THE WOODS DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY AND HE ASKED ME WHERE MOSES WAS WHEN THE CANDLE WENT OUT
THEN HERE COMES THE FERRYBOAT
 I SAYS LOOK AT MY HATIF YOU CALL IT A HATBUT THE LID RAISES UP AND THE REST OF IT GOES DOWN TILL IT'S BELOW MY CHIN AND THEN IT AIN'T RIGHTLY A HAT AT ALL BUT MORE LIKE MY HEAD WAS SHOVED UP THROUGH A JINT O STOVE-PIPE
 IT WARN'T NO USE TO SAY ANY MORE
 WELL THESE KIND OF MUMPS IS A KIND OF A HARROW AS YOU MAY SAYAND IT AIN'T NO SLOUCH OF A HARROW NUTHER YOU COME TO GET IT HITCHED ON GOOD WELL IT'S AWFUL I THINK SAYS THE HARE-LIP
 THERE AIN'T EVEN A DOG TO GIVE A SLEEPING-MIXTURE TO
AND THERE WAS THINGS ENOUGH ON THAT TABLE FOR SEVEN FAMILIESAND ALL HOT TOO
IT DOAN MAKE NO TRACK
 IN ANOTHER BILL HE WAS THE WORLD-RENOWNED SHAKESPEARIAN TRAGEDIAN GARRICK THE YOUNGER OF DRURY LANE LONDON  IN OTHER BILLS HE HAD A LOT OF OTHER NAMES AND DONE OTHER WONDERFUL THINGS LIKE FINDING WATER AND GOLD WITH A DIVINING-ROD DISSIPATING WITCH SPELLS AND SO ON
 COME BUCKLE TO YOUR PADDLE AND LET'S GET ALONG I BUCKLED TO MY PADDLE AND THEY LAID TO THEIR OARS
SO I MOTIONED THEM IN QUIET AND THEY SLIPPED UP ON HIM AND GRABBED HIM AND TIED HIM BEFORE HE KNOWED WHAT HE WAS ABOUT AND WE NEVER HAD NO TROUBLE
KEPT RIGHT ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
BUT YOUI MEAN SOMEBODYGOT IN AHEAD O ME IT'S A LIE
 _THINK OF IT S'I
BUT A HOG IS DIFFERENT
AND I'LL MAKE HIM PUNGLE TOO OR I'LL KNOW THE REASON WHY
AND I DO BELIEVE HE CARED JUST AS MUCH FOR HIS PEOPLE AS WHITE FOLKS DOES FOR THEIR'N
 SHE SAID SHE WARN'T ASHAMED OF ME
 I'D BEGUN TO THINK I WARN'T GOING TO GET A HINT OF NO KIND TO HELP ME
NOW GO ON AND I WON'T DO SO ANY MORE
SOMETIMES YOU COULD HEAR A SWEEP SCREAKING
 DIRECTLY IT BEGUN TO RAIN AND IT RAINED LIKE ALL FURY TOO AND I NEVER SEE THE WIND BLOW SO
SO HE SAID NOW FOR THE GRAND BULGE
SO WE STOPPED IN OUR TRACKS TILL THEY CATCHED UP
 THEN THEY'D SETTLE BACK AGAIN TILL THERE WAS A DOG FIGHT
AND SO I JUDGED THE RAFT MUST BE BUTTING INTO THE BANK EVERY NOW AND THEN OR ELSE IT WOULD GET FURTHER AHEAD AND CLEAR OUT OF HEARINGIT WAS FLOATING A LITTLE FASTER THAN WHAT I WAS
 THESE PEOPLE WAS MOSTLY KINFOLKS OF THE FAMILY
 IF THEY WARN'T THE BEATENEST LOT THEM TWO FRAUDS THAT EVER I STRUCK
 IF I'LL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW THE NIGGERS WILL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN INSIDE OF TWO WEEKSHERE IN THIS HOUSEAND PROVE HOW I KNOW ITWILL YOU GO TO MR LOTHROP'S AND STAY FOUR DAYS FOUR DAYS SHE SAYS
AND YET HERE HE WAS WITHOUT ANY MORE PRIDE OR RIGHTNESS OR FEELING THAN TO STOOP TO THIS BUSINESS AND MAKE HIMSELF A SHAME AND HIS FAMILY A SHAME BEFORE EVERYBODY
 SO I SAID I WOULD GO FOR IT
FISHING.THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE.A LIVELY RUN.JIM ADVISES A DOCTOR
 SO THE DUKE TOOK HIS HANDS OFF AND SAYS
SO WE HAD A RIGHT DOWN GOOD SOCIABLE TIME
I DO NOT WISH ANY REWARD BUT TO KNOW I HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING
 I'LL HUNT THE LABBOARD SIDE YOU HUNT THE STABBOARD
 HIS HAT WAS LAYING ON THE FLOORAN OLD BLACK SLOUCH WITH THE TOP CAVED IN LIKE A LID
 VERY WELL THEN
 BY AND BY HE SAID HE'D STRUCK SO MANY GOOD ONES HE DIDN'T HARDLY KNOW WHICH TO TAKE BUT THERE WAS ONE WHICH HE RECKONED HE'D DECIDE ON
 I SAID ALL RIGHT
 I COULDN MANAGE TO K'LECK DAT MONEY NO WAY
 IT WAS THE MOST UNDIGESTIBLE SAWDUST I EVER SEE
AND HE GIVE OUT THE IDEA THAT HIS CONGREGATION OVER IN ENGLAND WOULD BE IN A SWEAT ABOUT HIM SO HE MUST HURRY AND SETTLE UP THE ESTATE RIGHT AWAY AND LEAVE FOR HOME
 HE DIDN'T GO SOUND ASLEEP BUT WAS UNEASY
 WE WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH THIS BUSINESS AND TOM ALLOWED IT WAS WORTH TWICE THE TROUBLE IT TOOK BECAUSE HE SAID NOW SHE COULDN'T EVER COUNT THEM SPOONS TWICE ALIKE AGAIN TO SAVE HER LIFE
 THE WIDOW RUNG A BELL FOR SUPPER AND YOU HAD TO COME TO TIME
 CUSS YOU I CAN SEE NOW WHY YOU WAS SO ANXIOUS TO MAKE UP THE DEFFISITYOU WANTED TO GET WHAT MONEY I'D GOT OUT OF THE NONESUCH AND ONE THING OR ANOTHER AND SCOOP IT ALL THE KING SAYS TIMID AND STILL A-SNUFFLING
 HE SAID SO HIS OWN SELF AFTERWARDS
 WHY WHAT IN THE NATION DO YOU MEAN
 WELL THEY FROZE TO ME FOR TWO HOURS
AND WE PUT THE THREE TIN PLATES IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN UNDER THE VITTLES
WELL THAT LOOKED KIND OF REASONABLE SO I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING AGAINST IT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN A FROG LAY MOST AS MANY SO OF COURSE IT COULD BE DONE
 YOUR NEWSPAPERS CALL YOU A BRAVE PEOPLE SO MUCH THAT YOU THINK YOU ARE BRAVER THAN ANY OTHER PEOPLEWHEREAS YOU'RE JUST AS BRAVE AND NO BRAVER
 IT WOULDN'T DO TO TAKE TO THE SHORE
 I HAD TO LET ON TO GET CHOKED WITH A CHICKEN BONE SO AS TO GET TIME TO THINK HOW TO GET DOWN AGAIN
BUT WE COULDN'T SEE NO SIGN OF THEM
AND SHE'S GOING TO STICK TO THEM TILL THEY SAY THEY'LL COME AND THEN IF SHE AIN'T TOO TIRED SHE'S COMING HOME
 HERE'S A DOLLAR FOR YOU
 THIS HOLE'S BIG ENOUGH FOR JIM TO GET THROUGH IF WE WRENCH OFF THE BOARD TOM SAYS
 HINES HE HURT MY WRIST DREADFUL PULLING AND TUGGING SO AND I RECKON HE CLEAN FORGOT I WAS IN THE WORLD HE WAS SO EXCITED AND PANTING
AND AS FOR ME I WISHED I WAS IN JERUSLEM OR SOMEWHERES
 PRETTY SOON HE BEGUN TO SPEAK AND I SEE STRAIGHT OFF HE PRONOUNCED LIKE AN ENGLISHMANNOT THE KING'S WAY THOUGH THE KING'S WAS PRETTY GOOD FOR AN IMITATION
 AND WHAT'S MOREIF I WAS ONE OF THEM I WOULD SEE A MAN IN JERICHO BEFORE I WOULD DROP MY BUSINESS AND COME TO HIM FOR THE RUBBING OF AN OLD TIN LAMP HOW YOU TALK HUCK FINN
THEN WE PADDLED OVER HERE TO HEAR THE NEWS AND SID'S AT THE POST-OFFICE TO SEE WHAT HE CAN HEAR AND I'M A-BRANCHING OUT TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT FOR US AND THEN WE'RE GOING HOME SO THEN WE WENT TO THE POST-OFFICE TO GET SID
 I FELT VERY GOOD
YOU'RE THE HOUN I'M AFTER AND I'M A-GWYNE TO HAVE YOU TOO AND SO HE WENT ON CALLING SHERBURN EVERYTHING HE COULD LAY HIS TONGUE TO AND THE WHOLE STREET PACKED WITH PEOPLE LISTENING AND LAUGHING AND GOING ON
SET HER LOOSE JIM
AND THE SUIT WENT AGIN ONE OF THE MEN AND SO HE UP AND SHOT THE MAN THAT WON THE SUITWHICH HE WOULD NATURALLY DO OF COURSE
 IT WAS THAT DULL KIND OF A REGULAR SOUND THAT COMES FROM OARS WORKING IN ROWLOCKS WHEN IT'S A STILL NIGHT
 SO THE QUESTION WAS WHAT TO DO
WELL THEN I'LL BELIEVE SOME OF IT
 SO I JUDGED I'D GOT TO DO THE OTHER THINGLAY FOR THEM AND EAVESDROP
YOU SEE ALL KINDS OF THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN
 FACT IS I RECKON WE'D COME TO CONSIDER HIM OUR NIGGER
 IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD NO'M
THERE WAS GENERLY HOGS IN THE GARDEN AND PEOPLE DRIVING THEM OUT
 WHY DIDN'T YOU COME OUT AND SAY SO
 DAD FETCH IT I JIS WISHT I COULD GIT MY HAN'S ON ONE ER DEM WITCHES JIS WUNSTON'Y JIS WUNSTIT'S ALL I'D AST
WHY HUCK
I DON'T K'YER TO SEE EM NO MO THEN HE SLOPPED RIGHT ALONG AND WENT AWAY AND PRETTY SOON THE TREES HID HIM
SO THAT STIRRED UP THE PEOPLE AND A LOT OF MEN BEGUN TO PILE DOWN OFF OF THE BENCHES AND SWARM TOWARDS THE RING SAYING KNOCK HIM DOWN
 BUT WE GOT UNDER ALL RIGHT AND OUT THROUGH THE HOLE SWIFT BUT SOFTJIM FIRST ME NEXT AND TOM LAST WHICH WAS ACCORDING TO TOM'S ORDERS
 I AM PETER WILKS BROTHER HARVEY AND THIS IS HIS BROTHER WILLIAM WHICH CAN'T HEAR NOR SPEAKAND CAN'T EVEN MAKE SIGNS TO AMOUNT TO MUCH NOW'T HE'S ONLY GOT ONE HAND TO WORK THEM WITH
HE WAS CLEAN SHAVED EVERY MORNING ALL OVER HIS THIN FACE AND HE HAD THE THINNEST KIND OF LIPS AND THE THINNEST KIND OF NOSTRILS AND A HIGH NOSE AND HEAVY EYEBROWS AND THE BLACKEST KIND OF EYES SUNK SO DEEP BACK THAT THEY SEEMED LIKE THEY WAS LOOKING OUT OF CAVERNS AT YOU AS YOU MAY SAY
ONE MORNING WHEN WE WAS PRETTY WELL DOWN THE STATE OF ARKANSAW WE COME IN SIGHT OF A LITTLE ONE-HORSE TOWN IN A BIG BEND
 HOW'D THEY ACT THEY DIDN'T DO NOTHING
AND THEY SLID HIM EDGEWAYS BETWEEN TWO BARN DOORS FOR A COFFIN AND BURIED HIM SO SO THEY SAY BUT I DIDN'T SEE IT
 HE HAD SUSPICIONS OF HIS FATHER THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON
 THAT'S WHY THEY'RE INVITED HERE THIS EVENIN
ABOUT THIS TIME I MIGHTY NEAR STEPPED ON A GOOD-SIZED SNAKE AND IT WENT SLIDING OFF THROUGH THE GRASS AND FLOWERS AND I AFTER IT TRYING TO GET A SHOT AT IT
AND THAT MINUTE THE TWO BOYS STARTED ON THE RUN
SHAKE IT
 BUT IT WARN'T GOOD JUDGMENT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE BOOT THAT HAD A COUPLE OF HIS TOES LEAKING OUT OF THE FRONT END OF IT
 I'LL WALKI DON'T MIND THE DISTANCE BUT WE WON'T LET YOU WALKIT WOULDN'T BE SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY TO DO IT
 WILL YOU MARY JANE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF UP AND MY BUT SHE WAS HANDSOME
 _HE AS SOON CHOP A CHILE IN TWO AS A CAT
CHAPTER XXXVII
 COME RIGHT IN AND MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME SO TOM HE THANKED THEM VERY HEARTY AND HANDSOME AND LET HIMSELF BE PERSUADED AND COME IN
HE'S AS FREE AS ANY CRETUR THAT WALKS THIS EARTH WHAT DOES THE CHILD MEAN I MEAN EVERY WORD I SAY AUNT SALLY AND IF SOMEBODY DON'T GO I'LL GO
SO THEN HIM AND THE DUKE WITH A HAND ACROSS EACH OTHER'S SHOULDER AND T'OTHER HAND TO THEIR EYES WALKED SLOW AND SOLEMN OVER THERE EVERYBODY DROPPING BACK TO GIVE THEM ROOM AND ALL THE TALK AND NOISE STOPPING PEOPLE SAYING SH AND ALL THE MEN TAKING THEIR HATS OFF AND DROOPING THEIR HEADS SO YOU COULD A HEARD A PIN FALL
THEN I TOOK A BITE TO EAT AND BY AND BY LAID DOWN IN THE CANOE TO SMOKE A PIPE AND LAY OUT A PLAN
 I COULDN'T MAKE IT OUT
I HAD SHUT THE DOOR TO
THEN SOME MEN IN A SKIFF COME BY AND AS GOOD LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THE NIGGER WAS SETTING BY THE PALLET WITH HIS HEAD PROPPED ON HIS KNEES SOUND ASLEEP
THERE WARN'T NO BED IN THE PARLOR NOR A SIGN OF A BED
AND THE PLACE GETTING HOTTER AND HOTTER AND THE BUTTER BEGINNING TO MELT AND RUN DOWN MY NECK AND BEHIND MY EARS
THEY WON'T FIND ME AND THEY'LL THINK I'VE BEEN KILLED AND FLOATED DOWN THE RIVERTHERE'S SOMETHING UP THERE THAT LL HELP THEM THINK SOSO DON'T YOU LOSE NO TIME JIM BUT JUST SHOVE OFF FOR THE BIG WATER AS FAST AS EVER YOU CAN I NEVER FELT EASY TILL THE RAFT WAS TWO MILE BELOW THERE AND OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MISSISSIPPI
AND IF SHE DIDN'T EVERYBODY NATURALLY DESPISES AN UNGRATEFUL NIGGER AND THEY'D MAKE JIM FEEL IT ALL THE TIME AND SO HE'D FEEL ORNERY AND DISGRACED
BUT HE JERKED IT IN AGAIN AND SAYS
 HE SAID IF WE WARN'T PRISONERS IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT THING AND NOBODY BUT A MEAN ORNERY PERSON WOULD STEAL WHEN HE WARN'T A PRISONER
WHEN I GOT TO CAMP I WARN'T FEELING VERY BRASH THERE WARN'T MUCH SAND IN MY CRAW
SAID THE BAG OF GOLD WAS ENOUGH AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO NO DEEPERDIDN'T WANT TO ROB A LOT OF ORPHANS OF EVERYTHING THEY HAD
 I TOLD ABOUT LOUIS SIXTEENTH THAT GOT HIS HEAD CUT OFF IN FRANCE LONG TIME AGO
I'S SOLLERMUN
EN DE MAN DAT THINK HE KIN SETTLE A SPUTE BOUT A WHOLE CHILE WID A HALF A CHILE DOAN KNOW ENOUGH TO COME IN OUT'N DE RAIN
BY THE TIME WE HAD LEFT A MILE OF WOODS BEHIND US AND STRUCK THE RIVER EVERYTHING WAS QUIET AND WE PADDLED OVER TO THE TOWHEAD AND HID IN THE COTTONWOODS AND WAS SAFE
 THEN HE LAID STILLER AND DIDN'T MAKE A SOUND
AND THEN CUT YOUNG COTTONWOODS AND WILLOWS AND HID THE RAFT WITH THEM
 WE HUSTLED IT ON TO THE RAFT IN A PILE AND I TOLD JIM TO FLOAT ALONG DOWN AND SHOW A LIGHT WHEN HE JUDGED HE HAD GONE ABOUT TWO MILE AND KEEP IT BURNING TILL I COME
AND WHEN IT DID SHOW IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A THOUSAND MILE OFF
WAS YOU IN MY ROOM NIGHT BEFORE LAST NO YOUR MAJESTY"WHICH WAS THE WAY I ALWAYS CALLED HIM WHEN NOBODY BUT OUR GANG WARN'T AROUND
 WE WENT ALONG A NARROW PLACE AND GOT INTO A KIND OF ROOM ALL DAMP AND SWEATY AND COLD AND THERE WE STOPPED
I JUDGED I HAD DONE IT PRETTY NEATI RECKONED TOM SAWYER COULDN'T A DONE IT NO NEATER HIMSELF
BECAUSE TOM SAID WE GOT TO HAVE SOME LIGHT TO SEE HOW TO DIG BY AND A LANTERN MAKES TOO MUCH AND MIGHT GET US INTO TROUBLE
IN ST PETERSBURG THEY USED TO SAY THERE WAS TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN ST LOUIS BUT I NEVER BELIEVED IT TILL I SEE THAT WONDERFUL SPREAD OF LIGHTS AT TWO O'CLOCK THAT STILL NIGHT
YES MARS SID A DOG
AND IT WAS MIGHTY STILL IN THERE AND EVERYBODY BENDING A LITTLE FORWARDS AND GAZING AT HIM
AND SO AS LONG AS WE WAS REPRESENTING A PRISONER WE HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO STEAL ANYTHING ON THIS PLACE WE HAD THE LEAST USE FOR TO GET OURSELVES OUT OF PRISON WITH
HE WARN'T ANYWHERE
AND LAID LOW AND KEPT DARK TILL THE POOR OLD KING WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS CAVORTINGS ON THE STAGE
 I AIN'T THE MAN TO STAND ITYOU HEAR
 I SLEPT THE NIGHT THROUGH AND GOT UP BEFORE IT WAS LIGHT AND HAD MY BREAKFAST AND PUT ON MY STORE CLOTHES AND TIED UP SOME OTHERS AND ONE THING OR ANOTHER IN A BUNDLE AND TOOK THE CANOE AND CLEARED FOR SHORE
 I WALKED DOWN STREET A WAYS AND STOPPED
 YIT DEY SAY SOLLERMUN DE WISES MAN DAT EVER LIVE  I DOAN TAKE NO STOCK IN DAT
 THEN HE TURNS OFF SLOW AND DREAMY TOWARDS THE STAIRS SAYING
IT WAS WHITE
I TOOK A DIPPER AND A TIN CUP AND MY OLD SAW AND TWO BLANKETS AND THE SKILLET AND THE COFFEE-POT
 IF I HAD A YALLER DOG THAT DIDN'T KNOW NO MORE THAN A PERSON'S CONSCIENCE DOES I WOULD PISON HIM
 IN ABOUT A MINUTE EVERYBODY WAS SAYING IT
I'LL UP AND TELL THE TRUTH THIS TIME THOUGH IT DOES SEEM MOST LIKE SETTING DOWN ON A KAG OF POWDER AND TOUCHING IT OFF JUST TO SEE WHERE YOU'LL GO TO
WANT TO TELL ME_'T ANY CRETUR T'S IN HIS RIGHT MIND S A GOIN TO SCRABBLE ALL THEM CRAZY THINGS ONTO A GRINDSTONE S'I
AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE CAPERING AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HAW-HAWED TILL HE COME BACK AND DONE IT OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM DO IT ANOTHER TIME
 BUCK TAKE THIS LITTLE STRANGER AND GET THE WET CLOTHES OFF FROM HIM AND DRESS HIM UP IN SOME OF YOURS THAT'S DRY BUCK LOOKED ABOUT AS OLD AS METHIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN OR ALONG THERE THOUGH HE WAS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN ME
N HERE SO N SO PEGGED ALONG FOR THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR N ALL THATNATCHERL SON O LOUIS SOMEBODY N SICH EVERLAST'N RUBBAGE
BUT I DON'T KNOW EVERYBODY YET
A BODY THAT DON'T GET STARTED RIGHT WHEN HE'S LITTLE AIN'T GOT NO SHOWWHEN THE PINCH COMES THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO BACK HIM UP AND KEEP HIM TO HIS WORK AND SO HE GETS BEAT
CHAPTER XVII
CHAPTER XVII
 THERE AIN'T NO INSTANCE OF IT
 BUT I SEE I COULDN'T DO NOTHING WITHOUT A CANDLE AND I DASN'T LIGHT ONE OF COURSE
BECAUSE WHEN WE GET DOWN THE RIVER A HUNDRED MILE OR TWO I COULD WRITE BACK TO MARY JANE AND SHE COULD DIG HIM UP AGAIN AND GET IT
THEN THE COTTON FIELDS BEGINS AND AFTER THE FIELDS THE WOODS
 HE MOST DESPERATELY WANTED TO SEE HARVEYAND WILLIAM TOO FOR THAT MATTERBECAUSE HE WAS ONE OF THEM KIND THAT CAN'T BEAR TO MAKE A WILL
THEN WE FETCHED HIM OVER AND I STARTED DOWN FOR THE RAFT
 I WISH TOM SAWYER WAS HERE JIM HE GRUMBLED A LITTLE BUT GIVE IN
 YOU SEE HE STARTED TO TELL ME THE TRUTH
I WAS PRETTY HUNGRY BUT IT WARN'T GOING TO DO FOR ME TO START A FIRE BECAUSE THEY MIGHT SEE THE SMOKE
I'M SORRY AND I WARN'T EXPECTING IT
 HE HAD HEARD OLD SOWBERRY HAGAN IN HIS BEST DAYS AND HE SAID IT LAID OVER HIM TOO
AND THEN SHE WENT TO SLUICING OUT COFFEE WITH ONE HAND AND CRACKING THE HANDIEST CHILD'S HEAD WITH HER THIMBLE WITH THE OTHER AND SAYS
BUT THAT PIE WAS A JOB
 THERE AIN'T A MINUTE TO LOSE
 SO THERE'S A REWARD OUT FOR HIMTHREE HUNDRED DOLLARS
 THEN HE STRIKES A MOST NOBLE ATTITUDE WITH ONE LEG SHOVED FORWARDS AND HIS ARMS STRETCHED AWAY UP AND HIS HEAD TILTED BACK LOOKING UP AT THE SKY
 SHE WAS AT WORK ON WHAT THEY SAID WAS HER GREATEST PICTURE WHEN SHE TOOK SICK AND EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT IT WAS HER PRAYER TO BE ALLOWED TO LIVE TILL SHE GOT IT DONE BUT SHE NEVER GOT THE CHANCE
 THEY FEED HIM IN A PAN THAT AIN'T NOTHING
 I RECKONED I WAS SCARED NOW TOO
NEVER TALKED ABOUT NOTHING ELSE ALL THESE THREE WEEKS
 AND THEY'LL FOLLOW THAT MEAL TRACK TO THE LAKE AND GO BROWSING DOWN THE CREEK THAT LEADS OUT OF IT TO FIND THE ROBBERS THAT KILLED ME AND TOOK THE THINGS
AND SO FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS
WE WENT TIPTOEING ALONG A PATH AMONGST THE TREES BACK TOWARDS THE END OF THE WIDOW'S GARDEN STOOPING DOWN SO AS THE BRANCHES WOULDN'T SCRAPE OUR HEADS
 YOU DO A GIRL TOLERABLE POOR BUT YOU MIGHT FOOL MEN MAYBE
 NOTHING TO DO BUT HITCH YOUR ROPE LADDER TO THE BATTLEMENTS SHIN DOWN IT BREAK YOUR LEG IN THE MOATBECAUSE A ROPE LADDER IS NINETEEN FOOT TOO SHORT YOU KNOWAND THERE'S YOUR HORSES AND YOUR TRUSTY VASSLES AND THEY SCOOP YOU UP AND FLING YOU ACROSS A SADDLE AND AWAY YOU GO TO YOUR NATIVE LANGUDOC OR NAVARRE OR WHEREVER IT IS
THEN THE NICE BREEZE SPRINGS UP AND COMES FANNING YOU FROM OVER THERE SO COOL AND FRESH AND SWEET TO SMELL ON ACCOUNT OF THE WOODS AND THE FLOWERS
BUT THAT NEVER MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO AUNT SALLY
 I'LL SHOW HIM HOW TO MAKE IT WHEN HE GETS TO IT SHUCKS TOM I SAYS I THINK YOU MIGHT TELL A PERSON
 WHY DIDN'T YOU STEP INTO THE ROAD MY BOY THE SHEPHERDSONS DON'T FATHER
AND PRETTY SOON YOU'D HEAR A LOAFER SING OUT HI
JIM WARN'T THERE
THE WAY ALL THE BEST AUTHORITIES DOES IS TO SAW THE BED-LEG IN TWO AND LEAVE IT JUST SO AND SWALLOW THE SAWDUST SO IT CAN'T BE FOUND AND PUT SOME DIRT AND GREASE AROUND THE SAWED PLACE SO THE VERY KEENEST SENESKAL CAN'T SEE NO SIGN OF IT'S BEING SAWED AND THINKS THE BED-LEG IS PERFECTLY SOUND
 "I PUT IT IN THE COFFIN
PERHAPS THIS GENTLEMAN CAN TELL ME WHAT WAS TATTOOED ON HIS BREAST BLAMED IF THE KING DIDN'T HAVE TO BRACE UP MIGHTY QUICK OR HE'D A SQUSHED DOWN LIKE A BLUFF BANK THAT THE RIVER HAS CUT UNDER IT TOOK HIM SO SUDDEN
A MAN THAT HADN'T EVER DONE ME NO HARM
LEMME LOOK AT YOU CHILE LEMME FEEL O YOU
SOON AS NIGHT WAS MOST GONE WE STOPPED NAVIGATING AND TIED UPNEARLY ALWAYS IN THE DEAD WATER UNDER A TOWHEAD
IT WAS A CLOSE PLACE
I RECKONED I WOULD SNEAK OUT AND GO FOR THE WOODS TILL THE WEATHER MODERATED
I CATCHED A GOOD BIG CATFISH TOO AND JIM CLEANED HIM WITH HIS KNIFE AND FRIED HIM
YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
 A FEW DAYS AGO I WAS TALKING WITH AN OLD COUPLE THAT LIVES NEXT DOOR IN THE LOG SHANTY AND THEY HAPPENED TO SAY HARDLY ANYBODY EVER GOES TO THAT ISLAND OVER YONDER THAT THEY CALL JACKSON'S ISLAND
AND BY AND BY THE OLD MAN SAYS
 THEN HE SAYS
 THEN HE SAYS
 THEN HE SAYS
 THEN HE SAYS
 THEN HE SAYS
 THEN HE SAYS
DO HE KNOW YOU GENLMEN WE COULD SEE PRETTY WELL NOW
I NEVER SEE NOTHING LIKE IT
I DIDN'T MEAN NOTHING M'AM
 IT WAS THE KING AND THE DUKE
TWO OR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS WENT BY
 BUT HE TOOK THE PEN AND WROTE
 WAS YOU LOOKING FOR HIM YOU BET I AIN'T
 I SAYS TO MYSELF SHALL I GO TO THAT DOCTOR PRIVATE AND BLOW ON THESE FRAUDS
HERE HE COMES BOYS ALL THE LOAFERS LOOKED GLAD
SO WE COME BACK
WHY ROBINSON HAIN'T YOU HEARD THE NEWS
SO I QUIT
BUT MAINLY I WANTED TO PUT IN THE TIME
 I RUN ALONG THE BANK A PIECE AND GOT ABOARD AND JIM HE GRABBED ME AND HUGGED ME HE WAS SO GLAD TO SEE ME
THE DUKE HE NEVER LET ON HE SUSPICIONED WHAT WAS UP BUT JUST WENT A GOO-GOOING AROUND HAPPY AND SATISFIED LIKE A JUG THAT'S GOOGLING OUT BUTTERMILK
 NOW I SAY IT AIN'T A-GOIN TO BE MORE'N TWO HOURS BEFO THIS WRACK BREAKS UP AND WASHES OFF DOWN THE RIVER
FIRST THEY DONE A LECTURE ON TEMPERANCE
 "I'M THE CAPTAIN AND THE OWNER AND THE MATE AND THE PILOT AND WATCHMAN AND HEAD DECK-HAND
AND AS TO THE CANDLESTICK IT WARN'T NO CONSEQUENCE IT WOULD BLOW OVER BY AND BY
 HE WAS A BAPTIST
THEN GET UP MY CANOE TO-MORROW NIGHT AND FETCH MY RAFT OVER FROM THE ISLAND
 'FETCH UP JANE SHORE HE SAYS
I BET YOU CAN'T SPELL MY NAME SAYS I
THE DUKE SAID WHAT HE WAS AFTER WAS A PRINTING-OFFICE
 AND SO ONE AFTER THE OTHER THEY ALL SKIPPED OFF INTO THE RING AND MADE THE SWEETEST BOW I EVER SEE AND THEN SCAMPERED OUT AND EVERYBODY CLAPPED THEIR HANDS AND WENT JUST ABOUT WILD
 WHAT DOES I DO
 I DID MOS SHOLY
 WHEN A PRISONER OF STYLE ESCAPES IT'S CALLED AN EVASION
A-A-MEN COME ALL THAT'S WORN AND SOILED AND SUFFERING!COME WITH A BROKEN SPIRIT
BUT THEY COULDN'T MAKE NOTHING OUT OF THE FACE BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN IN THE WATER SO LONG IT WARN'T MUCH LIKE A FACE AT ALL
AS SOON AS I GOT STARTED I TOOK OUT AFTER THE RAFT HOT AND HEAVY RIGHT DOWN THE TOWHEAD
 I AM ONE OF THE GANG BUT HAVE GOT RELIGGION AND WISH TO QUIT IT AND LEAD AN HONEST LIFE AGAIN AND WILL BETRAY THE HELISH DESIGN
 I WAS A-STUDYING OVER MY TEXT IN ACTS SEVENTEEN BEFORE BREAKFAST AND I RECKON I PUT IT IN THERE NOT NOTICING MEANING TO PUT MY TESTAMENT IN AND IT MUST BE SO BECAUSE MY TESTAMENT AIN'T IN
WHEN I GOT TO THE THREE LOG DOORSTEPS I HEARD THEM UNLOCKING AND UNBARRING AND UNBOLTING
AND STEAD OF JUMPING OFF AND TAKING TO THE BRUSH BUD LOWED HE COULD OUT-RUN HIM
 THAT MADE ME FEEL EASY AND SATISFIED
 WHOEVER WOULD A THOUGHT IT WAS IN THAT MARE TO DO IT
 IT'S THE MOST DAZZLING IDEA AT EVER A MAN STRUCK
WELL ALL THROUGH THE CIRCUS THEY DONE THE MOST ASTONISHING THINGS
 HE SAID WE OUGHT TO BOW WHEN WE SPOKE TO HIM AND SAY YOUR GRACE OR MY LORD OR YOUR LORDSHIP"AND HE WOULDN'T MIND IT IF WE CALLED HIM PLAIN BRIDGEWATER WHICH HE SAID WAS A TITLE ANYWAY AND NOT A NAME
THE HOUSES HAD LITTLE GARDENS AROUND THEM BUT THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO RAISE HARDLY ANYTHING IN THEM BUT JIMPSON WEEDS AND SUNFLOWERS AND ASH-PILES AND OLD CURLED-UP BOOTS AND SHOES AND PIECES OF BOTTLES AND RAGS AND PLAYED-OUT TIN-WARE
 GO LONG NOW AND TELL HIM ANYTHING YOU WANT TO
IT WAS ONLY ONE DOG BUT HE MADE A MOST POWERFUL RACKET AND HE KEPT IT UP RIGHT ALONG
GENTLEMEN I WISH THE MONEY WAS THERE FOR I AIN'T GOT NO DISPOSITION TO THROW ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF A FAIR OPEN OUT-AND-OUT INVESTIGATION O THIS MISABLE BUSINESS
 I PUT ON THE SUN-BONNET AND TIED IT UNDER MY CHIN AND THEN FOR A BODY TO LOOK IN AND SEE MY FACE WAS LIKE LOOKING DOWN A JOINT OF STOVE-PIPE
THE PREACHING WAS GOING ON UNDER THE SAME KINDS OF SHEDS ONLY THEY WAS BIGGER AND HELD CROWDS OF PEOPLE
WHAT YOU DOIN WITH THIS GUN I JUDGED HE DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING SO I SAYS
 SO JIM SAYS
 THE IRON MASK ALWAYS DONE THAT AND IT'S A BLAME GOOD WAY TOO JIM AIN'T GOT NO TIN PLATES
 I TOOK ONE SLOW STEP AT A TIME AND THERE WARN'T A SOUND ONLY I THOUGHT I COULD HEAR MY HEART
THIS PLACE WAS A TOLERABLE LONG STEEP HILL OR RIDGE ABOUT FORTY FOOT HIGH
BUT THAT WARN'T PAP'S STYLE
 I COULDN'T TELL NOTHING ABOUT VOICES IN A FOG FOR NOTHING DON'T LOOK NATURAL NOR SOUND NATURAL IN A FOG
JACKSON'S ISLAND'S THE PLACE
WE ALL HAS TO HAVE OUR TROUBLES AND THIS N LL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
 BUT IT WARN'T SO THIS TIME
 YOU BET I DON'T BUT MA SHE MAKES ME
 WHEN WE GOT THERE SHE SET ME DOWN IN A SPLIT-BOTTOMED CHAIR AND SET HERSELF DOWN ON A LITTLE LOW STOOL IN FRONT OF ME HOLDING BOTH OF MY HANDS AND SAYS
 TOM SAWYER SAID I WAS A NUMSKULL
 DAT'S GOOD
 EVERYBODY WAS SORRY SHE DIED BECAUSE SHE HAD LAID OUT A LOT MORE OF THESE PICTURES TO DO AND A BODY COULD SEE BY WHAT SHE HAD DONE WHAT THEY HAD LOST
I'M A-GOING TO FIND OUT WHO IT IS THAT'S HERE ON THE ISLAND WITH ME
AND THE KING HE ALLOWED HE WOULD DROP OVER TO T'OTHER VILLAGE WITHOUT ANY PLAN BUT JUST TRUST IN PROVIDENCE TO LEAD HIM THE PROFITABLE WAYMEANING THE DEVIL I RECKON
THEY SEEMED TO STOP AND FOOL AROUND A WHILE
IT MOST BUSTED THEM BUT THEY MADE UP THE SIX THOUSAND CLEAN AND CLEAR
AND THEN WE TOOK IT AND PUT IT IN A SAFE PLACE UNDER AUNT SALLY'S BED
 WHY CERT'NLY IT WOULD WORK LIKE RATS A-FIGHTING
BUT THERE'D BE ANOTHER PERSON THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT WHO'D BE IN BIG TROUBLE
IT'S THE WAY THEY'RE RAISED BUT DIS ONE DO SMELL SO LIKE DE NATION HUCK WELL THEY ALL DO JIM
 WE MADE AN EXTRA STEERING-OAR TOO BECAUSE ONE OF THE OTHERS MIGHT GET BROKE ON A SNAG OR SOMETHING
AND WE'LL TAKE THE ONE WE LIKE THE BEST WHAT A HEAD FOR JUST A BOY TO HAVE
 EVERYBODY LOOKED HUNGRY AT IT AND LICKED THEIR CHOPS
 ME
 AND THEN WHAT DID YOU ALL DO WELL WE HOLLERED AND TOOK ON BUT IT'S SO WIDE THERE WE COULDN'T MAKE NOBODY HEAR
 YOU FEEL MIGHTY FREE AND EASY AND COMFORTABLE ON A RAFT
SO WAS HIS LONG MIXED-UP WHISKERS
 WHEN THE COURT WANTS TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT THESE TWO LET THEM SEND UP TO BRICKSVILLE AND SAY THEY'VE GOT THE MEN THAT PLAYED THE ROYAL NONESUCH AND ASK FOR SOME WITNESSESWHY YOU'LL HAVE THAT ENTIRE TOWN DOWN HERE BEFORE YOU CAN HARDLY WINK MISS MARY
 I COULD HEAR HIM THROUGH THE BLANKET
 DAT TRUCK DAH IS TRASH
THERE'S A GAUDY BIG GRINDSTONE DOWN AT THE MILL AND WE'LL SMOUCH IT AND CARVE THE THINGS ON IT AND FILE OUT THE PENS AND THE SAW ON IT TOO IT WARN'T NO SLOUCH OF AN IDEA
 NO YOU GO RIGHT ALONG MISS MARY JANE AND I'LL FIX IT WITH ALL OF THEM
AND IN A DAY OR TWO WHEN I GET THE BAGGAGE I CAN PROVE IT
 YOU DON'T RECKON IT'S GOING TO TAKE THIRTY-SEVEN YEARS TO DIG OUT THROUGH A DIRT FOUNDATION DO YOU HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TOM WELL WE CAN'T RESK BEING AS LONG AS WE OUGHT TO BECAUSE IT MAYN'T TAKE VERY LONG FOR UNCLE SILAS TO HEAR FROM DOWN THERE BY NEW ORLEANS
 WHAT TOW-HEAD
 SO THEN WE WENT AWAY AND WENT TO THE RUBBAGE-PILE IN THE BACK YARD WHERE THEY KEEP THE OLD BOOTS AND RAGS AND PIECES OF BOTTLES AND WORE-OUT TIN THINGS AND ALL SUCH TRUCK AND SCRATCHED AROUND AND FOUND AN OLD TIN WASHPAN AND STOPPED UP THE HOLES AS WELL AS WE COULD TO BAKE THE PIE IN AND TOOK IT DOWN CELLAR AND STOLE IT FULL OF FLOUR AND STARTED FOR BREAKFAST AND FOUND A COUPLE OF SHINGLE-NAILS THAT TOM SAID WOULD BE HANDY FOR A PRISONER TO SCRABBLE HIS NAME AND SORROWS ON THE DUNGEON WALLS WITH AND DROPPED ONE OF THEM IN AUNT SALLY'S APRON-POCKET WHICH WAS HANGING ON A CHAIR AND T'OTHER WE STUCK IN THE BAND OF UNCLE SILAS'S HAT WHICH WAS ON THE BUREAU BECAUSE WE HEARD THE CHILDREN SAY THEIR PA AND MA WAS GOING TO THE RUNAWAY NIGGER'S HOUSE THIS MORNING AND THEN WENT TO BREAKFAST AND TOM DROPPED THE PEWTER SPOON IN UNCLE SILAS'S COAT-POCKET AND AUNT SALLY WASN'T COME YET SO WE HAD TO WAIT A LITTLE WHILE
 THE RAFT WAS GONE
 WE'RE BOTH HERE THEN THE OLD MAN TURNS TOWARDS THE KING AND SAYS
 IT WARN'T NO TOWHEAD THAT YOU COULD FLOAT BY IN TEN MINUTES
GRANGERFORD.ARISTOCRACY.FEUDS.THE TESTAMENT.RECOVERING THE RAFT.THE WOODPILE.PORK AND CABBAGE
 THIS ONE KEPT POINTING THE PISTOL AT THE MAN'S HEAD ON THE FLOOR AND SAYING
RIGHT SMART CHANCE OF FUNERALS
 WHY IF YOU WAS TO BLOW ON US HE STOPPED BUT I NEVER SEE THE DUKE LOOK SO UGLY OUT OF HIS EYES BEFORE
 YOU OUGHT TO HAD YOUR JAWS BOXED
 WHY YOU'D THINK IT WAS CHRISTOPHER C'LUMBUS DISCOVERING KINGDOM-COME
SO I ROLLED OFF MY PALLET AND LAID WITH MY CHIN AT THE TOP OF MY LADDER AND WAITED TO SEE IF ANYTHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
 THAT WARN'T ENOUGH TO TAKE US FOURTEEN HUNDRED MILE DECK PASSAGE NOR NO OTHER WAY
 WHERE'D SHE GET AGROUND I DIDN'T RIGHTLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THE BOAT WOULD BE COMING UP THE RIVER OR DOWN
 ONCE WHEN I TURNED SHORT AND DODGED UNDER HIS ARM HE MADE A GRAB AND GOT ME BY THE JACKET BETWEEN MY SHOULDERS AND I THOUGHT I WAS GONE
AND THEN HE BLUBBERS OUT A PIOUS GOODY-GOODY AMEN AND TURNS HIMSELF LOOSE AND GOES TO CRYING FIT TO BUST
 THERE WARN'T NO OTHER SOUND BUT THE SCRAPING OF THE FEET ON THE FLOOR AND BLOWING NOSESBECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS BLOWS THEM MORE AT A FUNERAL THAN THEY DO AT OTHER PLACES EXCEPT CHURCH
SO HE SET DOWN AGAIN AND WENT TO WATCHING SAME AS BEFORE
WHEN THE LIGHTNING GLARED OUT WE COULD SEE A BIG STRAIGHT RIVER AHEAD AND HIGH ROCKY BLUFFS ON BOTH SIDES
YOU MAY ASK JIM IF I DIDN'T JIM SAID IT WAS SO
THE PEOPLE HAD MOVED OUT OF THEM
AT FIRST I HATED THE SCHOOL BUT BY AND BY I GOT SO I COULD STAND IT
BUT ABOUT THE THIRD CRACK I NOTICED A SOUND THAT I KNOWED MIGHTY WELL AND HELD MY BREATH AND LISTENED AND WAITED
 IT'S A GOOD BUSINESSYES THE KING SNARLS AROUND ON HIM AND SAYS
 JIM GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND PUT HIS EAR AGAINST IT AND LISTENED
HE'S ALWAYS A-CARRYIN ON LIKE THAT WHEN HE'S DRUNK
SO THEN I CREPT INTO A LUMBER-PILE TO GET SOME SLEEP
 I RECKON I'LL CUT IT PRETTY SHORT
 HE SAID THE WITCHES WAS PESTERING HIM AWFUL THESE NIGHTS AND MAKING HIM SEE ALL KINDS OF STRANGE THINGS AND HEAR ALL KINDS OF STRANGE WORDS AND NOISES AND HE DIDN'T BELIEVE HE WAS EVER WITCHED SO LONG BEFORE IN HIS LIFE
 I JUDGED I COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS TWO PROVIDENCES AND A POOR CHAP WOULD STAND CONSIDERABLE SHOW WITH THE WIDOW'S PROVIDENCE BUT IF MISS WATSON'S GOT HIM THERE WARN'T NO HELP FOR HIM ANY MORE
NEXT I GOT TO ITCHING UNDERNEATH
 THE OTHER OAR WAS SMASHED OFF AND THE RAFT WAS LITTERED UP WITH LEAVES AND BRANCHES AND DIRT
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST JACKASS IDEAS I EVER STRUCK BUT HE NEVER PAID NO ATTENTION TO ME
AMEN COME SICK AND SORE
AND AT LAST WHEN HE HAD GONE AROUND TWO SIDES OF THE ROOM HE DISAPPEARS DOWN CELLAR
TO THINK I SHOULD HAVE LIVED TO BE LEADING SUCH A LIFE AND BE DEGRADED DOWN INTO SUCH COMPANY  AND HE BEGUN TO WIPE THE CORNER OF HIS EYE WITH A RAG
THEY WISHED HE COULD STAY LONGER BUT THEY SAID THEY COULD SEE IT COULDN'T BE DONE
 SAID HIS BROTHER WILLIAM WAS THE CUSSEDEST JOKER IN THE WORLD AND HADN'T TRIED TO WRITE_HE SEE WILLIAM WAS GOING TO PLAY ONE OF HIS JOKES THE MINUTE HE PUT THE PEN TO PAPER
BUT I SLID OUT OF THE JACKET QUICK AS LIGHTNING AND SAVED MYSELF
AND TOLD HIM TO BUY SOME MORE THREAD TO TIE UP HIS WOOL WITH
WELL I WENT FOOLING ALONG IN THE DEEP WOODS TILL I JUDGED I WARN'T FAR FROM THE FOOT OF THE ISLAND
 I TOLE YOU I GOT A HAIRY BREAS EN WHAT'S DE SIGN UN IT
THEN THERE WAS MISS CHARLOTTE
 THE TWO BOYS WAS SQUATTING BACK TO BACK BEHIND THE PILE SO THEY COULD WATCH BOTH WAYS
NO SAYS I TO MY SELF THERE AIN'T NOTHING IN IT
AND TOM SAID THE SAME
 AND THEY'LL COME A-BILING TOO I JUDGED WE HAD GOT EVERYTHING FIXED ABOUT RIGHT NOW
AND IT STAYED WITH ME AND SCORCHED ME MORE AND MORE
AND SOMETIMES I'M THE FREIGHT AND PASSENGERS
 HE SAID SHE WOULD SLAP DOWN A LINE AND IF SHE COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING TO RHYME WITH IT WOULD JUST SCRATCH IT OUT AND SLAP DOWN ANOTHER ONE AND GO AHEAD
 SO I FIXED THAT AS GOOD AS I COULD FROM THE OUTSIDE BY SCATTERING DUST ON THE PLACE WHICH COVERED UP THE SMOOTHNESS AND THE SAWDUST
 YOUR MISTAKE IS THAT YOU DIDN'T BRING A MAN WITH YOU
 THE HARE-LIP SHE GOT TO PUMPING ME ABOUT ENGLAND AND BLEST IF I DIDN'T THINK THE ICE WAS GETTING MIGHTY THIN SOMETIMES
 THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS AT THE DOOR AND HE SAYS
 I'VE TRIED EM ALL AND THER AIN'T NO BETTER WAY MOST EVERYBODY WOULD A BEEN SATISFIED WITH THE PILE AND TOOK IT ON TRUST
THE WORLD MAY GO ON JUST AS IT'S ALWAYS DONE AND TAKE EVERYTHING FROM MELOVED ONES PROPERTY EVERYTHING
 I KNOWED VERY WELL WHY THEY WOULDN'T COME
AND THEN LOOKS AT JIM AND SAYS
NO SIR WE'LL JUST GO ON AND RANSOM THEM IN THE REGULAR WAY ALL RIGHT
 LE'S COMMENCE RIGHT AWAY SO THE DUKE HE TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT WHO ROMEO WAS AND WHO JULIET WAS AND SAID HE WAS USED TO BEING ROMEO SO THE KING COULD BE JULIET
 WELL IT MADE ME SICK TO SEE IT
THINKS I IT WON'T DO TO PADDLE
 BUT DON'T TRY TO BUDGE
BUT IT DIDN'T SAVE HIM
 JIM HE COULDN'T SEE NO SENSE IN THE MOST OF IT BUT HE ALLOWED WE WAS WHITE FOLKS AND KNOWED BETTER THAN HIM
OR JUMBLED UP VOICES IT WAS SO STILL AND SOUNDS COME SO FAR
 PRISONERS AIN'T EVER WITHOUT RATS
BECAUSE NOBODY SEE HER GO
 HE CUSSED AWAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND THROWED HIS HAT DOWN IN THE MUD AND RODE OVER IT AND PRETTY SOON AWAY HE WENT A-RAGING DOWN THE STREET AGAIN WITH HIS GRAY HAIR A-FLYING
THE WORLD NEVER BELIEVESLET IT PASS'TIS NO MATTER
THE OLD GENTLEMAN OWNED A LOT OF FARMS AND OVER A HUNDRED NIGGERS
 HE SAID HE WOULD SPLIT OPEN A RAW IRISH POTATO AND STICK THE QUARTER IN BETWEEN AND KEEP IT THERE ALL NIGHT AND NEXT MORNING YOU COULDN'T SEE NO BRASS AND IT WOULDN'T FEEL GREASY NO MORE AND SO ANYBODY IN TOWN WOULD TAKE IT IN A MINUTE LET ALONE A HAIR-BALL
HE SAY HE RECK'N YOU'S BEN SHOT KASE YOU DIDN COME HOME NO MO
UNKNOWN FRIEND CHAPTER XL
FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY
 HE WAS JUST SUITEDTHIS KIND OF THING WAS RIGHT IN HIS LINE
 SOME THINK OLD FINN DONE IT HIMSELF NOIS THAT SO MOST EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT AT FIRST
SO THEN I LIT OUTFOR BED I SAID MEANING SOME TIME OR ANOTHER
 YOU CAN DO IT
 BUT TOM HE SHOWED HIM HOW UNREGULAR IT WOULD BE AND SET DOWN AND TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT OUR PLANS AND HOW WE COULD ALTER THEM IN A MINUTE ANY TIME THERE WAS AN ALARM
JUST SLID THE LID ALONG AS SOFT AS MUSH AND SCREWED IT DOWN TIGHT AND FAST
 I WISH WE'D A TIMED HER
 "WE ARE SOLDMIGHTY BADLY SOLD
IN THE DEAD WASTE AND MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN IN CUSTOMARY SUITS OF SOLEMN BLACK BUT THAT THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY FROM WHOSE BOURNE NO TRAVELER RETURNS BREATHES FORTH CONTAGION ON THE WORLD AND THUS THE NATIVE HUE OF RESOLUTION LIKE THE POOR CAT I THE ADAGE IS SICKLIED O'ER WITH CARE
WE WENT TO A CLUMP OF BUSHES AND TOM MADE EVERYBODY SWEAR TO KEEP THE SECRET AND THEN SHOWED THEM A HOLE IN THE HILL RIGHT IN THE THICKEST PART OF THE BUSHES
 I THOUGHT TILL I WORE MY HEAD SORE BUT I COULDN'T SEE NO WAY OUT OF THE TROUBLE
BUT YOU'LL BE GOOD WON'T YOU
I GOT A GOOD PLACE AMONGST THE LEAVES AND SET THERE ON A LOG MUNCHING THE BREAD AND WATCHING THE FERRY-BOAT AND VERY WELL SATISFIED
BUT I BEGGED AND BEGGED AND AT THE LAST MINUTE SHE LET ME COME TOO
 THE YOUNG FELLOW SAYS

 I SEE THE FOG CLOSING DOWN AND IT MADE ME SO SICK AND SCARED I COULDN'T BUDGE FOR MOST A HALF A MINUTE IT SEEMED TO MEAND THEN THERE WARN'T NO RAFT IN SIGHT
 HE FLUNG IT DOWN AND SAYS

 I HADN'T GOT FAR WHEN I HEAR A MAN SAY

 THE KING WAS SAYINGIN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING HE'D STARTED IN ON THEY BEIN PARTICKLER FRIENDS O THE DISEASED
 I DON'T WANT IT AT ALLNOR THE SIX THOUSAND NUTHER
AND YOU CAN'T GET NO OTHER KIND OUT OF A JEWS-HARP
 WHAT DO WE K'YER FOR HIM
WE TRIED TO COMFORT HIM BUT HE SAID IT WARN'T MUCH USE HE COULDN'T BE MUCH COMFORTED
WHY BLESS YOU SAUL THE POOR THING'S AS WET AS HE CAN BE
BUT IT'S THE PLAN NOW SO DRAT HIM WE WENT ALONG BUT I DIDN'T LIKE IT MUCH
IN THE MORNING WE WENT OUT TO THE WOODPILE AND CHOPPED UP THE BRASS CANDLESTICK INTO HANDY SIZES AND TOM PUT THEM AND THE PEWTER SPOON IN HIS POCKET
THIS TABLE HAD A COVER MADE OUT OF BEAUTIFUL OILCLOTH WITH A RED AND BLUE SPREAD-EAGLE PAINTED ON IT AND A PAINTED BORDER ALL AROUND
 IF YOU GET HERE BEFORE ELEVEN PUT A CANDLE IN THIS WINDOW AND IF I DON'T TURN UP WAIT TILL ELEVEN AND THEN IF I DON'T TURN UP IT MEANS I'M GONE AND OUT OF THE WAY AND SAFE
 SO I DROPPED ON MY HANDS AND KNEES IN THE LITTLE PASSAGE AND CREPT AFT IN THE DARK TILL THERE WARN'T BUT ONE STATEROOM BETWIXT ME AND THE CROSS-HALL OF THE TEXAS
 HE HAD AN OLD BATTERED-UP SLOUCH HAT ON AND A GREASY BLUE WOOLLEN SHIRT AND RAGGED OLD BLUE JEANS BRITCHES STUFFED INTO HIS BOOT-TOPS AND HOME-KNIT GALLUSESNO HE ONLY HAD ONE
 SHE TOLD ABOUT ME AND TOM SAWYER FINDING THE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS ONLY SHE GOT IT TEN AND ALL ABOUT PAP AND WHAT A HARD LOT HE WAS AND WHAT A HARD LOT I WAS AND AT LAST SHE GOT DOWN TO WHERE I WAS MURDERED
 SH-SHE SISTER HOTCHKISS SH-SHE BUT HOW IN THE NATION'D THEY EVER GIT THAT GRINDSTONE IN THERE ANYWAY
 WELL WHILST THEY WAS AT IT A STEAMBOAT LANDED AND IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES UP COMES A CROWD A-WHOOPING AND YELLING AND LAUGHING AND CARRYING ON AND SINGING OUT
THINGS GET MIXED UP AND THE JUICE KIND OF SWAPS AROUND AND THE THINGS GO BETTER
HE'S WHITE I RECKON WE'LL GO AND SEE FOR OURSELVES I WISH YOU WOULD SAYS I BECAUSE IT'S PAP THAT'S THERE AND MAYBE YOU'D HELP ME TOW THE RAFT ASHORE WHERE THE LIGHT IS
 I POKED INTO THE PLACE A-WAYS AND COME TO A LITTLE OPEN PATCH AS BIG AS A BEDROOM ALL HUNG AROUND WITH VINES AND FOUND A MAN LAYING THERE ASLEEPAND BY JINGS IT WAS MY OLD JIM
AND THEN THINK OF ME
 THEN WE WENT TO THE NIGGER CABINS AND WHILE I GOT NAT'S NOTICE OFF TOM SHOVED A PIECE OF CANDLESTICK INTO THE MIDDLE OF A CORN-PONE THAT WAS IN JIM'S PAN AND WE WENT ALONG WITH NAT TO SEE HOW IT WOULD WORK AND IT JUST WORKED NOBLE
IT WARN'T THE GROUNDINGTHAT DIDN'T KEEP US BACK BUT A LITTLE
 IT WAS PRETTY GOOD TIMES UP IN THE WOODS THERE TAKE IT ALL AROUND
 YOU SEE EF I KEP ON TRYIN TO GIT AWAY AFOOT DE DOGS UD TRACK ME
ALL RIGHT
ALL RIGHT
ALL RIGHT
ALL RIGHT
 IT WOULD ONLY LOOK LIKE WE WAS FINDING FAULT AND THAT WOULD BE BOUND TO FETCH MORE BAD LUCKAND KEEP ON FETCHING IT TOO TILL WE KNOWED ENOUGH TO KEEP STILL
IS DAT SO OF COURSE IT IS
 I ROSE UP AND THERE WAS JACKSON'S ISLAND ABOUT TWO MILE AND A HALF DOWN STREAM HEAVY TIMBERED AND STANDING UP OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER BIG AND DARK AND SOLID LIKE A STEAMBOAT WITHOUT ANY LIGHTS
 BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS A-WANDERING OFF ON A SIDE ISSUE
AND THEN THERE HE WAS SLIM AND HANDSOME AND DRESSED THE GAUDIEST AND PRETTIEST YOU EVER SAW AND HE LIT INTO THAT HORSE WITH HIS WHIP AND MADE HIM FAIRLY HUMAND FINALLY SKIPPED OFF AND MADE HIS BOW AND DANCED OFF TO THE DRESSING-ROOM AND EVERYBODY JUST A-HOWLING WITH PLEASURE AND ASTONISHMENT
 I WAS A GOOD DEAL ASTONISHED BUT WHEN I GOT MY BREATH I ASKED HER WHAT THE PAPER WAS ABOUT AND SHE ASKED ME IF I HAD READ IT AND I SAID NO AND SHE ASKED ME IF I COULD READ WRITING AND I TOLD HER NO ONLY COARSE-HAND AND THEN SHE SAID THE PAPER WARN'T ANYTHING BUT A BOOK-MARK TO KEEP HER PLACE AND I MIGHT GO AND PLAY NOW
AND YOUWELL LET ME SEEOH I'VE GOT ITYOU CAN DO HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY HAMLET'S WHICH HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY YOU KNOW
 IT WAS A FIX I TELL YOU
 AND IF HE'S GONE OVER TO T'OTHER SIDE GO OVER THERE AND GIT HIM
HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE WIDOW GET ME
 _YES SIR I K'N TELL YOU WHAT'S TATTOOED ON HIS BREAST
AND TWICE I WENT DOWN THE ROD AWAY IN THE NIGHT AND SLIPPED AROUND FRONT AND SEE HER SETTING THERE BY HER CANDLE IN THE WINDOW WITH HER EYES TOWARDS THE ROAD AND THE TEARS IN THEM
HONEST INJUN NOW HAIN'T YOU BEEN TELLING ME A LOT OF LIES HONEST INJUN SAYS I
 THEY CAN'T BILE THAT AMOUNT OF WATER AWAY OFF THERE AT THE SEA
 _DAH NOW
 THE RIVER WAS COMING UP PRETTY FAST AND LOTS OF DRIFTWOOD GOING BY ON THE RISE
 IT WAS A POWERFUL FINE SIGHT
CHAPTER XXIX
 THEY HAD COME UP FROM THE QUARRY AND STOOD AROUND THE STILE A WHILE AND THEN WENT ON AROUND THE GARDEN FENCE
DONE BY HIM 300 CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS IN PARIS
I SAY GROUND BECAUSE IT WAS GROUNDHARD PACKED AND NO BOARDS
LE'S RIDE EM ON A RAIL AND EVERYBODY WAS WHOOPING AT ONCE AND THERE WAS A RATTLING POWWOW
 _NOW WHAT DO YOU SAYHEY WELL I NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT OLD BLISTER FOR CLEAN OUT-AND-OUT CHEEK
THE HEAT LIGHTNING WAS SQUIRTING AROUND LOW DOWN IN THE SKY AND THE LEAVES WAS BEGINNING TO SHIVERIT WAS GOING TO BE PRETTY UGLY IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT
 IT WAS A VILLAGE
 SHE AIMED RIGHT FOR US
AND WHEN HE MENTIONED THE ST LOUIS ONES IT GIVE ME THE COLD SHIVERS AND I SEE WE HADN'T NO TIME TO LOSE
WHY WHAT CAN YOU MEAN MY BOY I SAYS DON'T YOU ASK ME NO QUESTIONS ABOUT IT PLEASE
 I WOULDN'T LOW NO NIGGER TO CALL ME DAT SHUCKS IT AIN'T CALLING YOU ANYTHING
 I'D SEE HIM STANDING MY WATCH ON TOP OF HIS'N STEAD OF CALLING ME SO I COULD GO ON SLEEPING
WHY JIM NEMMINE WHY HUCKBUT HE AIN'T COMIN BACK NO MO BUT I KEPT AT HIM
 HE LIVES AT THE UPPER END OF THE TOWN SHE SAYS
 I TOLD HIM ME AND MY BROTHER WAS OVER ON SPANISH ISLAND HUNTING YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND CAMPED ON A PIECE OF A RAFT WE FOUND AND ABOUT MIDNIGHT HE MUST A KICKED HIS GUN IN HIS DREAMS FOR IT WENT OFF AND SHOT HIM IN THE LEG AND WE WANTED HIM TO GO OVER THERE AND FIX IT AND NOT SAY NOTHING ABOUT IT NOR LET ANYBODY KNOW BECAUSE WE WANTED TO COME HOME THIS EVENING AND SURPRISE THE FOLKS
 I COULD HEAR THE OWLS AND THE WOLVES AWAY OFF IN THE WOODS AND IT SEEMED TERRIBLE STILL
BUT THE OLD FOOL HE BULLED RIGHT ALONG SPITE OF ALL THE DUKE COULD SAY OR DO AND I TELL YOU THE DUKE WAS POWERFUL UNEASY
IT'S MOSTLY DONE THAT WAY
BUT THE KING ALLOWED HE WOULDN'T
SNATCH THAT LIGHT AWAY BETSY YOU OLD FOOLAIN'T YOU GOT ANY SENSE
 YOU SEE THEY WAS FIRING CANNON OVER THE WATER TRYING TO MAKE MY CARCASS COME TO THE TOP
WHY THEY GET A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IF THEY WANT IT
 DON'T STAND THERE PALAVERING ALL DAY BUT OUT WITH YOU AND SEE IF THERE'S A FISH ON THE LINES FOR BREAKFAST
 THEY ALL SAID SO M'AM IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO HOLD IN
THERE WAS A FREE NIGGER THERE FROM OHIOA MULATTER MOST AS WHITE AS A WHITE MAN
 BUT NOT VERY DIFFERENT
 I TOLD HIM I HAD AN OLD SLICK COUNTERFEIT QUARTER THAT WARN'T NO GOOD BECAUSE THE BRASS SHOWED THROUGH THE SILVER A LITTLE AND IT WOULDN'T PASS NOHOW EVEN IF THE BRASS DIDN'T SHOW BECAUSE IT WAS SO SLICK IT FELT GREASY AND SO THAT WOULD TELL ON IT EVERY TIME
 I'LL TELL YOU HOW TO FIND THEM
 JIM SAID IF THE TWO BIG RIVERS JOINED TOGETHER THERE THAT WOULD SHOW
 HE KNOWED HOW TO DO EVERYTHING
WHEN WE GOT THERE THERE WARN'T NOBODY STIRRING
 I CATCHED A CATFISH AND HAGGLED HIM OPEN WITH MY SAW AND TOWARDS SUNDOWN I STARTED MY CAMP FIRE AND HAD SUPPER
HE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING
 IT'S A CLEAN HAND NOW
BUT I RECK'N DEY WOULDN TAKE NO STOCK IN A JUICE-HARP YES THEY WOULD _THEY DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF MUSIC TIS
I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THE SOUTH AND I'VE LIVED IN THE NORTH
AND AS SOON AS THE MOB WOULD GET NEARLY TO THEM THEY WOULD BREAK AND SKADDLE BACK OUT OF REACH
 I WENT UP TO MY ROOM WITH A PIECE OF CANDLE AND PUT IT ON THE TABLE
BUT I COULD CARRY IT JUST AS HANDY IN MY OWN TOGS YOU WOULDN'T LOOK LIKE A SERVANT-GIRL THEN WOULD YOU NO BUT THERE WON'T BE NOBODY TO SEE WHAT I LOOK LIKE ANYWAY THAT AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
I'D TAKE EN BUST HIM OVER DE HEADDAT IS IF HE WARN'T WHITE
 THEN THE REVEREND HOBSON OPENED UP SLOW AND SOLEMN AND BEGUN TO TALK
 I TOOK ALL THE COFFEE AND SUGAR THERE WAS AND ALL THE AMMUNITION
 YES AND AIN'T PRIVILEGED TO SING THE SONG YET
 I WAS BOSS OF IT
 WHEN THE PLACE COULDN'T HOLD NO MORE THE DUKE HE QUIT TENDING DOOR AND WENT AROUND THE BACK WAY AND COME ON TO THE STAGE AND STOOD UP BEFORE THE CURTAIN AND MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND PRAISED UP THIS TRAGEDY AND SAID IT WAS THE MOST THRILLINGEST ONE THAT EVER WAS
WE COULDN'T TAKE THE RAFT UP THE STREAM OF COURSE
 I NEVER DID SEE SUCH A GIRL AS YOU
AND OF COURSE THAT BOAT STARTED HER ENGINES AGAIN TEN SECONDS AFTER SHE STOPPED THEM FOR THEY NEVER CARED MUCH FOR RAFTSMEN
THEY WAS SNORING
IT'S THE HAND OF A MAN THAT'S STARTED IN ON A NEW LIFE AND'LL DIE BEFORE HE'LL GO BACK
 AND YET HE MADE A MIGHTY FUSS ONE DAY AFTER THAT WHEN I STOLE A WATERMELON OUT OF THE NIGGER-PATCH AND EAT IT
I KNOW ALL WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
 SO AWAY I SHOVED AND TURNED THE CORNER AND NEARLY RAMMED MY HEAD INTO UNCLE SILAS'S STOMACH
SO AT LAST HE SAYS
I LAID DAH UNDER DE SHAVIN'S ALL DAY
 BUT S'POSE SHE DON'T BREAK UP AND WASH OFF WELL WE CAN WAIT THE TWO HOURS ANYWAY AND SEE CAN'T WE ALL RIGHT THEN
 WE GOT TO DIG HIM OUT WITH THE PICKS AND LET ON IT'S CASE-KNIVES NOW YOU'RE TALKING  I SAYS
 I WARN'T EASY MYSELF BUT I DIDN'T TAKE MY HAT OFF ALL THE SAME
AND SO AS LONG AS NO HARM HADN'T COME OF IT SHE JUDGED SHE BETTER PUT IN HER TIME BEING GRATEFUL WE WAS ALIVE AND WELL AND SHE HAD US STILL STEAD OF FRETTING OVER WHAT WAS PAST AND DONE
WHY HE WAS MY NIGGER AND THAT WAS MY MONEY
 THE CROWD LOOKED MIGHTY SOBER
 SO THE SLEEP DIDN'T DO ME NO GOOD
THAT LL FIX IT
BUT THE DUKE SAYS
 I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK NO MORE
AND HERE AT THE LAST MINUTE LO AND BEHOLD YOU THEY SLIDES RIGHT IN UNDER OUR NOSES AND FOOLS US AND NOT ONLY FOOLS US BUT THE INJUN TERRITORY ROBBERS TOO AND ACTULY GETS AWAY WITH THAT NIGGER SAFE AND SOUND AND THAT WITH SIXTEEN MEN AND TWENTY-TWO DOGS RIGHT ON THEIR VERY HEELS AT THAT VERY TIME

CHAPTER XXI
YOU COULDN'T SEE A BREAK IN IT HARDLY EVER OR A LIGHT
 HERE A CAPTIVE HEART BUSTED
 NO SIR

 WE HADN'T EVER BEEN THIS RICH BEFORE IN NEITHER OF OUR LIVES
 I FOUND THAT SWEET MISS SOPHIA STANDING IN HER DOOR WHICH WAS NEXT TO OURS AND SHE TOOK ME IN HER ROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR VERY SOFT AND ASKED ME IF I LIKED HER AND I SAID I DID
 HE SAID THEY WAS MADE THAT WAY FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER
SO THEY CRIED AGAIN
HE JUMPED UP YELLING AND THE FIRST THING THE LIGHT SHOWED WAS THE VARMINT CURLED UP AND READY FOR ANOTHER SPRING
AND PRETTY SOON HE SAYS
 THE KING GOT THE DIRECTIONS AND ALLOWED HE'D GO AND WORK THAT CAMP-MEETING FOR ALL IT WAS WORTH AND I MIGHT GO TOO
WHAT WE MUST HAVE WAS A LOT OF THEM ROTTEN CHUNKS THAT'S CALLED FOX-FIRE AND JUST MAKES A SOFT KIND OF A GLOW WHEN YOU LAY THEM IN A DARK PLACE
THAT IS THE BARE BODKIN THAT MAKES CALAMITY OF SO LONG LIFE
WHY THAT'S JUST WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOUR GRACE THEN HE DIDN'T LOOK SO JOYFUL AND SAYS
 OTHER TIMES IT WAS HID WITH A LITTLE CURTAIN
IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER HE'S A NATURAL ONE OR AN UNNATURAL ONE SO TOM HE WROTE THE NONNAMOUS LETTER AND I SMOUCHED THE YALLER WENCH'S FROCK THAT NIGHT AND PUT IT ON AND SHOVED IT UNDER THE FRONT DOOR THE WAY TOM TOLD ME TO
AND WHEN THERE WAS A BODY COULDN'T SLEEP IT WAS SO LIVELY AND IT WAS ALWAYS LIVELY HE SAID BECAUSE THEY NEVER ALL SLEPT AT ONE TIME BUT TOOK TURN ABOUT SO WHEN THE SNAKES WAS ASLEEP THE RATS WAS ON DECK AND WHEN THE RATS TURNED IN THE SNAKES COME ON WATCH SO HE ALWAYS HAD ONE GANG UNDER HIM IN HIS WAY AND T'OTHER GANG HAVING A CIRCUS OVER HIM AND IF HE GOT UP TO HUNT A NEW PLACE THE SPIDERS WOULD TAKE A CHANCE AT HIM AS HE CROSSED OVER
THINKS I WHAT IS THE COUNTRY A-COMING TO

 THE RATS COULD A GOT THE CANDLES AND I RECKON THEY DID
 OF COURSE I WOULD
 HAIN'T YOUR UNCLES OBLEEGD TO GET ALONG HOME TO ENGLAND AS FAST AS THEY CAN
WE LAID LOW AND KEPT STILL AND NEVER SHOVED OUT TILL NEARLY TEN O'CLOCK
BUT SHE GOT WELL EN ONE DAY SHE WAS A-STANNIN AROUN EN I SAYS TO HER I SAYS
 SO I WAS SATISFIED AND SAID WE WOULD WALTZ IN ON IT
AND WHEN I JUDGED I WAS OUT OF EYE-REACH I LAID ON MY OARS AND LOOKED BACK AND SEE HER GO AND SMELL AROUND THE WRECK FOR MISS HOOKER'S REMAINDERS BECAUSE THE CAPTAIN WOULD KNOW HER UNCLE HORNBACK WOULD WANT THEM
 "THESE OLD LETTERS IS FROM HARVEY WILKS
 AND TO SEE THE COOL WAY OF THAT NIGGERWHY HE WOULDN'T A GIVE ME THE ROAD IF I HADN'T SHOVED HIM OUT O THE WAY
WELL THEY HELD THE AUCTION IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE ALONG TOWARDS THE END OF THE AFTERNOON AND IT STRUNG ALONG AND STRUNG ALONG AND THE OLD MAN HE WAS ON HAND AND LOOKING HIS LEVEL PISONEST UP THERE LONGSIDE OF THE AUCTIONEER AND CHIPPING IN A LITTLE SCRIPTURE NOW AND THEN OR A LITTLE GOODY-GOODY SAYING OF SOME KIND AND THE DUKE HE WAS AROUND GOO-GOOING FOR SYMPATHY ALL HE KNOWED HOW AND JUST SPREADING HIMSELF GENERLY
 NOW TROT ALONG TO YOUR UNCLE SARAH MARY WILLIAMS GEORGE ELEXANDER PETERS AND IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE YOU SEND WORD TO MRS JUDITH LOFTUS WHICH IS ME AND I'LL DO WHAT I CAN TO GET YOU OUT OF IT

 YOU HOLD STILLI'LL GO EN SEE HE WENT AND BENT DOWN AND LOOKED AND SAYS
WE SPREAD THE BLANKETS INSIDE FOR A CARPET AND EAT OUR DINNER IN THERE
BUT IN A MINUTE I SEE I WAS MISTAKENTHAT IS AFTER THE FIRST JOLT AS YOU MAY SAY WHEN MY BREATH SORT OF HITCHED HE BEING SO UNEXPECTED
 AND I ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND TO PRAY AND SEE IF I COULDN'T TRY TO QUIT BEING THE KIND OF A BOY I WAS AND BE BETTER
SHET DE DO SHE NEVER DONE IT
AND I S'POSE HE NO IT COME YESTERDAY
 HE CATCHED ME A COUPLE OF TIMES AND THRASHED ME BUT I WENT TO SCHOOL JUST THE SAME AND DODGED HIM OR OUTRUN HIM MOST OF THE TIME
 IT WAS ONE OF THESE REGULAR SUMMER STORMS
 WE WARN'T GOING TO BORROW IT WHEN THERE WARN'T ANYBODY AROUND THE WAY PAP WOULD DO FOR THAT MIGHT SET PEOPLE AFTER US
AND EVERY LITTLE WHILE THE PRETTIEST KIND OF GIRLS WITH THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN THEIR CHEEKS WOULD UP AND ASK HIM WOULD HE LET THEM KISS HIM FOR TO REMEMBER HIM BY
I GOT MY TRAPS OUT OF THE CANOE AND MADE ME A NICE CAMP IN THE THICK WOODS
 SALLY IT'S TERRIBLEJUST TERRIBLESOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO THE BOAT SURE WHY SILAS
SOMETIMES THE WHEEL BITES OFF A SWEEP AND THEN THE PILOT STICKS HIS HEAD OUT AND LAUGHS AND THINKS HE'S MIGHTY SMART
 THE WAY THINGS WAS SCATTERED ABOUT WE RECKONED THE PEOPLE LEFT IN A HURRY AND WARN'T FIXED SO AS TO CARRY OFF MOST OF THEIR STUFF
NO!IS THAT SO
IT'S WHAT I SAYS IN THE FUST PLACE IT'S WHAT I SAYS IN THE MIDDLE N IT'S WHAT I SAYS LAST N ALL THE TIMETHE NIGGER'S CRAZYCRAZY S NEBOKOODNEEZER S'I AN LOOK AT THAT-AIR LADDER MADE OUT'N RAGS SISTER HOTCHKISS SAYS OLD MRS DAMRELL
 AND DO YOU RECKON THEY'D BE MEAN ENOUGH TO GO OFF AND LEAVE YOU TO GO ALL THAT JOURNEY BY YOURSELVES
 AND I RECKON IT'S BEEN DONE
THAT'S THE WAY A WOMAN MOST ALWAYS DOES BUT A MAN ALWAYS DOES T'OTHER WAY
THEN THE KING HE HUNCHED THE DUKE PRIVATEI SEE HIM DO ITAND THEN HE LOOKED AROUND AND SEE THE COFFIN OVER IN THE CORNER ON TWO CHAIRS
 HOW'D IT GET THERE I REELY DON'T KNOW SALLY HE SAYS KIND OF APOLOGIZING OR YOU KNOW I WOULD TELL
 WE SPLIT THE BALL OPEN WITH THE HATCHET AND THERE WAS A SPOOL IN IT
 WELL WHEN IT COME TO THAT IT WORKED THE CROWD LIKE YOU NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT AND EVERYBODY BROKE DOWN AND WENT TO SOBBING RIGHT OUT LOUDTHE POOR GIRLS TOO
 "IT'S REAL MYSTERIOUS AND TROUBLESOME AND GOOD HE SAYS
 BEEN THERE EVER SINCE
IT'S GOOD DAYLIGHT
A FARMER BY THE NAME OF SILAS PH AND THEN HE STOPPED
 THE MOON WAS SO BRIGHT I COULD A COUNTED THE DRIFT LOGS THAT WENT A-SLIPPING ALONG BLACK AND STILL HUNDREDS OF YARDS OUT FROM SHORE
 I TRAVELED NIGHTS AND HID DAYTIMES AND SLEPT AND THE BAG OF BREAD AND MEAT I CARRIED FROM HOME LASTED ME ALL THE WAY AND I HAD A-PLENTY
SO WE SAID WE WOULD IF HE WOULD TELL US HOW
 DAT'S DE WAY SOLLERMUN WAS GWYNE TO DO WID DE CHILE
SO AT LAST THE DUKE SAID HE RECKONED HE'D LAY OFF AND WORK HIS BRAINS AN HOUR OR TWO AND SEE IF HE COULDN'T PUT UP SOMETHING ON THE ARKANSAW VILLAGE
 I DON'T WANT NO BETTER BOOK THAN WHAT YOUR FACE IS
 WE PADDLED OUT AND GOT ABOARDCLUMB IN AT AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW
 WE NEVER SEEN ANY MARKS AT ALL WELL EVERYBODY WAS IN A STATE OF MIND NOW AND THEY SINGS OUT
 GO FOR THE STEAMBOAT HUCKLEBERRY
ONCE I SAID TO MYSELF IT WOULD BE A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER FOR JIM TO BE A SLAVE AT HOME WHERE HIS FAMILY WAS AS LONG AS HE'D GOT TO BE A SLAVE AND SO I'D BETTER WRITE A LETTER TO TOM SAWYER AND TELL HIM TO TELL MISS WATSON WHERE HE WAS
 THERE WAS AS MUCH AS A THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE FROM TWENTY MILE AROUND
THERE WAS ANOTHER CLAN OF ARISTOCRACY AROUND THEREFIVE OR SIX FAMILIESMOSTLY OF THE NAME OF SHEPHERDSON
 BUT THERE WARN'T NO SPANIARDS AND A-RABS AND THERE WARN'T NO CAMELS NOR NO ELEPHANTS
TAKE A TURN TO MESMERISM AND PHRENOLOGY WHEN THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT MAN WARN'T HERE FOR NO GOOD
 I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING WELL I SAYS IF IT'S IN THE REGULATIONS AND HE'S GOT TO HAVE IT ALL RIGHT LET HIM HAVE IT
AND SHE HAD AN OPEN LETTER IN ONE HAND WITH BLACK SEALING WAX SHOWING ON ONE EDGE OF IT AND SHE WAS MASHING A LOCKET WITH A CHAIN TO IT AGAINST HER MOUTH AND UNDERNEATH THE PICTURE IT SAID AND ART THOU GONE YES THOU ART GONE ALAS  THESE WAS ALL NICE PICTURES I RECKON BUT I DIDN'T SOMEHOW SEEM TO TAKE TO THEM BECAUSE IF EVER I WAS DOWN A LITTLE THEY ALWAYS GIVE ME THE FAN-TODS
JUST YOU SLIDE DOWN CELLAR AND FETCH IT
LOOK AT THAT BED-LEG SAWED OFF WITH M A WEEK'S WORK FOR SIX MEN
 IT DIDN'T HAVE AN IRON LATCH ON THE FRONT DOOR NOR A WOODEN ONE WITH A BUCKSKIN STRING BUT A BRASS KNOB TO TURN THE SAME AS HOUSES IN TOWN

I LAY I MAKE YOU MINE EN WID DAT I FETCH HER A SLAP SIDE DE HEAD DAT SONT HER A-SPRAWLIN DEN I WENT INTO DE YUTHER ROOM EN UZ GONE BOUT TEN MINUTES
 JUST A WORD GENTLEMEN  THEY STOPPED TO LISTEN

THE MINUTE I WAS FAR ENOUGH ABOVE THE TOWN TO SEE I COULD MAKE THE TOWHEAD I BEGUN TO LOOK SHARP FOR A BOAT TO BORROW AND THE FIRST TIME THE LIGHTNING SHOWED ME ONE THAT WASN'T CHAINED I SNATCHED IT AND SHOVED
 I WANTED TO KNOW YOUR PLANS
 BLAMED IF HE WARN'T THE HORRIBLEST LOOKING OUTRAGE I EVER SEE

I WAS UP IN A SECOND AND SHINNING DOWN THE HILL
 WILLIAM FOURTH
 "YOU'LL STAY RIGHT WHER YOU ARE
ONCE OR TWICE OF A NIGHT WE WOULD SEE A STEAMBOAT SLIPPING ALONG IN THE DARK AND NOW AND THEN SHE WOULD BELCH A WHOLE WORLD OF SPARKS UP OUT OF HER CHIMBLEYS AND THEY WOULD RAIN DOWN IN THE RIVER AND LOOK AWFUL PRETTY
 IF I HAD CAPITAL AND A THEATER I WOULDN'T WANT A BETTER LAY-OUT THAN THATAND HERE WE'VE GONE AND SOLD EM FOR A SONG
 THEN I TURNED AROUND AND THERE HE WAS
HE SAID IT SHOWED IT WAS DONE RIGHT
 AUNT SALLY SHE STUCK TO THE SICK-ROOM ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT AND EVERY TIME I SEE UNCLE SILAS MOONING AROUND I DODGED HIM
 WHEN WE COME AROUND YOU TURN YOUR BACK
WE GOT A LICKING EVERY TIME ONE OF OUR SNAKES COME IN HER WAY AND SHE ALLOWED THESE LICKINGS WARN'T NOTHING TO WHAT SHE WOULD DO IF WE EVER LOADED UP THE PLACE AGAIN WITH THEM
 I WAS TRYING TO MAKE MY MOUTH SAY I WOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND THE CLEAN THING AND GO AND WRITE TO THAT NIGGER'S OWNER AND TELL WHERE HE WAS
AND BY AND BY A DRUNK MAN TRIED TO GET INTO THE RINGSAID HE WANTED TO RIDE
 THEY SETS DOWN THEN AND THE KING SAYS

AND THAT PLEASED EVERYBODY TOO BECAUSE THEN THE GIRLS WOULD BE WELL FIXED AND AMONGST THEIR OWN RELATIONS

 BUT I SAID MAYBE WE MIGHT THINK WE WAS PASSING THE FOOT OF AN ISLAND AND COMING INTO THE SAME OLD RIVER AGAIN

 THAT'LL ANSWER
BUT MAYBE NEXT DAY MISS WATSON WOULD TAKE HOLD AND KNOCK IT ALL DOWN AGAIN
EVERYBODY IN BED I RECKON
WHY THERE'S SOMEBODY COME
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE JEST ONE LITTLE CAT-NAP
 HE WAS LAYING OVER BY THE CORNER
 A BODY CAN SET DOWN AND READ IT OFF LIKE COARSE PRINT
 EN DIDN'T YOU WHOOP EN DIDN'T I WHOOP TELL WE GOT MIX UP IN DE ISLANDS EN ONE UN US GOT LOS EN T'OTHER ONE WAS JIS AS GOOD AS LOS KASE HE DIDN KNOW WHAH HE WUZ
BUT IF THEY WAS JOYFUL IT WARN'T NOTHING TO WHAT I WAS
 BY RIGHTS I RECKON WE OUGHT TO BE A COUPLE OF YEARS
 HIS LAWYER SAID HE RECKONED HE WOULD WIN HIS LAWSUIT AND GET THE MONEY IF THEY EVER GOT STARTED ON THE TRIAL
 I JUDGED HE WOULD BE BLIND DRUNK IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN I WOULD STEAL THE KEY OR SAW MYSELF OUT ONE OR T'OTHER
WHY IS THIS MY POOR DEAD BROTHER'S OLD FRIEND THAT HE'S WROTE SO OFTEN ABOUT THE LAWYER AND HIM SHOOK HANDS AND THE LAWYER SMILED AND LOOKED PLEASED AND THEY TALKED RIGHT ALONG AWHILE AND THEN GOT TO ONE SIDE AND TALKED LOW
 BUT DO YOU MEAN BEFORE YOU GO TO MR LOTHROP'S OR OH SHE SAYS WHAT AM I THINKING ABOUT SHE SAYS AND SET RIGHT DOWN AGAIN
 I DON'T WANT TO HEAR NO MORE OUT OF YOU SAYS THE DUKE
 PICKS AND SHOVELSWHY THEY WOULDN'T FURNISH EM TO A KING WELL THEN I SAYS IF WE DON'T WANT THE PICKS AND SHOVELS WHAT DO WE WANT A COUPLE OF CASE-KNIVES TO DIG THE FOUNDATIONS OUT FROM UNDER THAT CABIN WITH YES CONFOUND IT IT'S FOOLISH TOM IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE HOW FOOLISH IT IS IT'S THE RIGHT WAYAND IT'S THE REGULAR WAY
 SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL
 THEN BILL HE COME OUT AND GOT IN
AND THERE AIN'T A MAN IN THAT TOWN THAT'S GOT AS FINE CLOTHES AS WHAT HE HAD
AND I WARN YOU AS A FRIEND AND AN HONEST ONE THAT WANTS TO PROTECT YOU AND KEEP YOU OUT OF HARM AND TROUBLE TO TURN YOUR BACKS ON THAT SCOUNDREL AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM THE IGNORANT TRAMP WITH HIS IDIOTIC GREEK AND HEBREW AS HE CALLS IT
WHEN IT WAS BEGINNING TO COME ON DARK WE POKED OUR HEADS OUT OF THE COTTONWOOD THICKET AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN AND ACROSS
IT MUST A BEEN CLOSE ON TO ONE O'CLOCK WHEN WE GOT BELOW THE ISLAND AT LAST AND THE RAFT DID SEEM TO GO MIGHTY SLOW
 IT AIN'T UNLIKELY
WHEN WE GOT HOME AUNT SALLY WAS THAT GLAD TO SEE ME SHE LAUGHED AND CRIED BOTH AND HUGGED ME AND GIVE ME ONE OF THEM LICKINGS OF HERN THAT DON'T AMOUNT TO SHUCKS AND SAID SHE'D SERVE SID THE SAME WHEN HE COME
 IT MIGHTN'T BE YOU KNOW HE JUMPED AND GOT THE CANOE READY AND PUT HIS OLD COAT IN THE BOTTOM FOR ME TO SET ON AND GIVE ME THE PADDLE
 SHE KEPT A-RAGING RIGHT ALONG RUNNING HER INSURRECTION ALL BY HERSELF AND EVERYBODY ELSE MIGHTY MEEK AND QUIET
MY HEART JUMPED UP AMONGST MY LUNGS
AND THE PLACE WAS THAT DAMP I NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT
 YOU PREPARED TO DIE THEN HE RODE ON
 NOTHING COULDN'T BE BETTER
I HAD JUST ONE LITTLE GLIMPSE OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHEN HE COME IN
I'VE KNOWED HIM ALL HIS LIFE AND SO HAS TOM THERE
 HE WAS A BLOSSOM
NEXT MORNING I SAID IT WAS GETTING SLOW AND DULL AND I WANTED TO GET A STIRRING UP SOME WAY
 HE HAS DONE GENEROUS BY THESE YER POOR LITTLE LAMBS THAT HE LOVED AND SHELTERED AND THAT'S LEFT FATHERLESS AND MOTHERLESS
SAID HE HADN'T HAD A DRINK ALL DAY
 DEY'S DE DADBLAMEDEST CRETURS TO STURB A BODY EN RUSTLE ROUN OVER IM EN BITE HIS FEET WHEN HE'S TRYIN TO SLEEP I EVER SEE
AND AT LAST WHEN MY CHIN WAS SO TIRED IT COULDN'T HARDLY GO ANY MORE I HAD TOLD THEM MORE ABOUT MY FAMILYI MEAN THE SAWYER FAMILYTHAN EVER HAPPENED TO ANY SIX SAWYER FAMILIES
 I KNEW THE FIRST HOUSE WOULD KEEP MUM AND LET THE REST OF THE TOWN GET ROPED IN
THEN WE GOT OUT AND I WAS IN A SWEAT TO GET AWAY
NOW WE'RE ALL RIGHT
YOU BET IT IS WHEN WE GOT TO THE HOUSE THE STREET IN FRONT OF IT WAS PACKED AND THE THREE GIRLS WAS STANDING IN THE DOOR
 I TOOK OUT THE PLUG AND SHOOK OUT THE LITTLE DAB OF QUICKSILVER AND SET MY TEETH IN
HERE THEY ARE
 WE WANT TO LUG THIS H-YER MONEY UP STAIRS AND COUNT IT BEFORE EVERYBODYTHEN THER AIN'T NOTH'N SUSPICIOUS
BUT I'D DRUTHER BEEN BIT WITH A SNAKE THAN PAP'S WHISKY
I SUNG OUT FOR JIM ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES BUT I DIDN'T GET ANY ANSWER
 THE KING NEVER SAID NOTHING ABOUT GOING ABOARD SO I LOST MY RIDE AFTER ALL
 LAWYER BELL WAS AWAY UP TO LOUISVILLE ON BUSINESS
 THEY KEPT EMMELINE'S ROOM TRIM AND NICE AND ALL THE THINGS FIXED IN IT JUST THE WAY SHE LIKED TO HAVE THEM WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE AND NOBODY EVER SLEPT THERE
SAID HE WAS BOSS OF HIS SON AND HE'D MAKE IT WARM FOR HIM
 IT AIN'T MY FAULT I WARN'T BORN A DUKE IT AIN'T YOUR FAULT YOU WARN'T BORN A KINGSO WHAT'S THE USE TO WORRY
THEN YOU TAKE TO THE WATER AND WADE DOWN TO ME AND GET INTHAT'LL THROW THE DOGS OFF THE SCENT THEY DONE IT AND SOON AS THEY WAS ABOARD I LIT OUT FOR OUR TOWHEAD AND IN ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES WE HEARD THE DOGS AND THE MEN AWAY OFF SHOUTING
AND I DID START TO TELL HIM
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT MAYBE YOU'LL LET ME ASK WHAT WAS YOU REFERRING TO SHUCKS SAYS THE KING VERY SARCASTIC
BUT THE WAY BUCK DID TAKE ON BECAUSE HE DIDN'T MANAGE TO KILL HARNEY THAT DAY HE SHOT AT HIMI HAIN'T EVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE IT
I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD SWIM SO I MADE A DASH FOR IT AND MISS HOOKER SHE SAID IF I DIDN'T STRIKE HELP SOONER COME HERE AND HUNT UP HER UNCLE AND HE'D FIX THE THING
THEY CUSSED JIM CONSIDERBLE THOUGH AND GIVE HIM A CUFF OR TWO SIDE THE HEAD ONCE IN A WHILE BUT JIM NEVER SAID NOTHING AND HE NEVER LET ON TO KNOW ME AND THEY TOOK HIM TO THE SAME CABIN AND PUT HIS OWN CLOTHES ON HIM AND CHAINED HIM AGAIN AND NOT TO NO BED-LEG THIS TIME BUT TO A BIG STAPLE DROVE INTO THE BOTTOM LOG AND CHAINED HIS HANDS TOO AND BOTH LEGS AND SAID HE WARN'T TO HAVE NOTHING BUT BREAD AND WATER TO EAT AFTER THIS TILL HIS OWNER COME OR HE WAS SOLD AT AUCTION BECAUSE HE DIDN'T COME IN A CERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND FILLED UP OUR HOLE AND SAID A COUPLE OF FARMERS WITH GUNS MUST STAND WATCH AROUND ABOUT THE CABIN EVERY NIGHT AND A BULLDOG TIED TO THE DOOR IN THE DAYTIME
 IF ANY REAL LYNCHING'S GOING TO BE DONE IT WILL BE DONE IN THE DARK SOUTHERN FASHION
 ANSWER UP PROMPT NOWDON'T STOP TO STUDY OVER IT
IF YOU REACH OUT YOUR ARM YOU CAN TOUCH HIM
AND IF YOU'LL BELIEVE ME SHE DID GIVE HARE-LIP HARK FROM THE TOMB
YOUR UNCLE HARVEY'S A PREACHER AIN'T HE
MISSUS DEY'S A SHEET GONE A SHEET GONE
 STRANGE NIGGERS WOULD STAND WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN AND LOOK HIM ALL OVER SAME AS IF HE WAS A WONDER
 THE LAWYER LOOKED POWERFUL ASTONISHED AND SAYS
 WE BOOMED ALONG DOWN THE RIVER WATCHING FOR LIGHTS AND WATCHING FOR OUR RAFT
 I WENT STRAIGHT OUT IN THE COUNTRY AS MUCH AS A MILE BEFORE I STOPPED
AND STRAIGHT OFF THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS ROW BUSTED OUT IN THE CELLAR A BODY EVER HEARD
 IT WOULD GET ALL AROUND THAT HUCK FINN HELPED A NIGGER TO GET HIS FREEDOM
 DE MEN UZ ALL WAY YONDER IN DE MIDDLE WHAH DE LANTERN WUZ
AND I AIN'T GOT NO TIME TO BLOW NOHOW
 THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S EYES BLAZED A MINUTE'TWAS PLEASURE MAINLY I JUDGEDTHEN HIS FACE SORT OF SMOOTHED DOWN AND HE SAYS KIND OF GENTLE
 SHOVE ALONG NOW I SEE WHAT HE WAS UP TO
THEN SOMETIMES THE ONE THAT OWNS THE TOBACCO LOOKS MOURNFUL AT IT WHEN IT'S HANDED BACK AND SAYS SARCASTIC
 IT WAS THE MOST ASTONISHING SPEECH I EVER HEARDAND I'M BOUND TO SAY TOM SAWYER FELL CONSIDERABLE IN MY ESTIMATION
 I NEVER SEE A FAMILY IN SUCH A SWEAT
 I WISH THERE WAS A MOAT TO THIS CABIN
THEN I DONE THE SAME WITH THE SIDE OF BACON
WHAT'S THEM  I SAYS
 BUT NOW SHE SAYS
 WHO'S THEY WHY EVERYBODY
 WHY WOULDN'T THEY
 WHERE DID YOU HIDE IT I DIDN'T WANT TO SET HER TO THINKING ABOUT HER TROUBLES AGAIN
AND MY INSTINCT SAID SHE WOULD BE COMING UPFROM DOWN TOWARDS ORLEANS
 I'LL HOOK A GOWN FROM AUNT SALLY WELL THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO STAY IN THE CABIN WHEN ME AND JIM LEAVES NOT MUCH
 I SAID I RECKONED THEY KILLED HIM TOO
BIG DOUBLE LOG-HOUSE FOR THE WHITE FOLKSHEWED LOGS WITH THE CHINKS STOPPED UP WITH MUD OR MORTAR AND THESE MUD-STRIPES BEEN WHITEWASHED SOME TIME OR ANOTHER
THE FIRST SHED WE COME TO THE PREACHER WAS LINING OUT A HYMN
HE AIN'T A-COMIN BACK NO MO HUCK I SAYS
 I TRIED FOR THE HOOKS THREE OR FOUR TIMES BUT SOMEHOW I COULDN'T MAKE IT WORK
 THEN I SET DOWN IN A CHAIR BY THE WINDOW AND TRIED TO THINK OF SOMETHING CHEERFUL BUT IT WARN'T NO USE
AND HERE COMES THE OLD MAN WITH A CANDLE IN ONE HAND AND A BUNDLE OF STUFF IN T'OTHER LOOKING AS ABSENT-MINDED AS YEAR BEFORE LAST
 THEN HE DROPS DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND PUTS HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND SAYS
THEN WE SET DOWN ON THE SANDY BOTTOM WHERE THE WATER WAS ABOUT KNEE DEEP AND WATCHED THE DAYLIGHT COME
 DEAR DEAR OUT OF HIS HEAD AGAIN NO I AIN'T OUT OF MY HEAD
 THEN I SLIPPED DOWN TO THE GROUND AND CRAWLED IN AMONG THE TREES AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS TOM SAWYER WAITING FOR ME
SOME DAY I'LL LIE DOWN IN IT AND FORGET IT ALL AND MY POOR BROKEN HEART WILL BE AT REST  HE WENT ON A-WIPING
DID YOU TELL AUNTY I WAS GOING TO SAY YES
 SHE HAD THE GRIT TO PRAY FOR JUDUS IF SHE TOOK THE NOTIONTHERE WARN'T NO BACK-DOWN TO HER I JUDGE
AND WE WAS ALL PRETTY MUCH FAGGED OUT TOO BUT MAINLY JIM
 ROPES ARE THE CORRECT THINGWE MUST PRESERVE THE UNITIES AS WE SAY ON THE BOARDS WE ALL SAID THE DUKE WAS PRETTY SMART AND THERE COULDN'T BE NO TROUBLE ABOUT RUNNING DAYTIMES
AND JIM'S NIGGER WAS PILING UP A TIN PAN WITH BREAD AND MEAT AND THINGS
 IT HAD THE BIG TIMBER OF A REGULAR ISLAND
 AND IT'S USUAL FOR THE PRISONER'S MOTHER TO CHANGE CLOTHES WITH HIM AND SHE STAYS IN AND HE SLIDES OUT IN HER CLOTHES
ROMEO
SO I STEPPED INTO THE WOODS AND LAID DOWN FOR A NAP BEFORE BREAKFAST
 WE'LL DIG HIM OUT
 HE WAS SAYING HOW THE FIRST THING HE WOULD DO WHEN HE GOT TO A FREE STATE HE WOULD GO TO SAVING UP MONEY AND NEVER SPEND A SINGLE CENT AND WHEN HE GOT ENOUGH HE WOULD BUY HIS WIFE WHICH WAS OWNED ON A FARM CLOSE TO WHERE MISS WATSON LIVED
 AND TELL HIM TO GIT HIMSELF UP REGARDLESS
AND DO YOU RECKON A NIGGER CAN RUN ACROSS MONEY AND NOT BORROW SOME OF IT YOUR HEAD'S LEVEL AGIN DUKE SAYS THE KING
NOW YOU THINK IT'S BAD LUCK
BUM
 I HAD EVERYTHING I NEEDED AND THE BOY WAS DOING AS WELL THERE AS HE WOULD A DONE AT HOMEBETTER MAYBE BECAUSE IT WAS SO QUIET
 YOU WANTS TO KEEP WAY FUM DE WATER AS MUCH AS YOU KIN EN DON'T RUN NO RESK KASE IT'S DOWN IN DE BILLS DAT YOU'S GWYNE TO GIT HUNG WHEN I LIT MY CANDLE AND WENT UP TO MY ROOM THAT NIGHT THERE SAT PAP HIS OWN SELF
AND IF HE DID GET SAVED WHOEVER SAVED HIM WOULD SEND HIM BACK HOME SO AS TO GET THE REWARD AND THEN MISS WATSON WOULD SELL HIM SOUTH SURE
 BUT OF COURSE WE THOUGHT OF THE RIGHT WAY AT LASTWHICH WAS TO COOK THE LADDER TOO IN THE PIE
 IT ALWAYS INTERESTS THEM
 WELL I FOUGHT ALONG AND DIRECTLY I HEARS THE WHOOP BEHIND ME
 AND WHEN IT WAS BEDTIME THE OLD MAN ROSE UP AND HELD OUT HIS HAND AND SAYS
 THEY'RE AFTER US JIM NEVER ASKED NO QUESTIONS HE NEVER SAID A WORD
WHAT IN THE NAME O GOODNESS COULD HE EVER WANT OF THE VERY WORDS I WAS A-SAYIN NO LONGER AGO TH'N THIS MINUTE TO SISTER UTTERBACK N SHE'LL TELL YOU SO HERSELF
WELL I SAYS I NEEDED THE WATERMELON
DEY'S REGLAR RAPSCALLIONS WELL THAT'S WHAT I'M A-SAYING
AND HE HAD A GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN AND A SILVER-HEADED CANETHE AWFULEST OLD GRAY-HEADED NABOB IN THE STATE
 YOU GWYNE TO HAVE CONSIDABLE TROUBLE IN YO LIFE EN CONSIDABLE JOY
 THAT'S ONLY IN THE SUMMER TIME WHEN HE COMES THERE TO TAKE THE SEA BATHS WHY HOW YOU TALKSHEFFIELD AIN'T ON THE SEA WELL WHO SAID IT WAS WHY YOU DID I DIDN'T NUTHER YOU DID I DIDN'T YOU DID I NEVER SAID NOTHING OF THE KIND WELL WHAT DID YOU SAY THEN SAID HE COME TO TAKE THE SEA BATHS_THAT'S WHAT I SAID WELL THEN HOW'S HE GOING TO TAKE THE SEA BATHS IF IT AIN'T ON THE SEA LOOKY HERE I SAYS
THERE AIN'T NO SENSE IN IT
 I WAS GLAD THE WAY IT COME OUT TOO BECAUSE CRABAPPLES AIN'T EVER GOOD AND THE P'SIMMONS WOULDN'T BE RIPE FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS YET
IT WAS TOM SAWYER ON A MATTRESS
PAP'LL BE MIGHTY MUCH OBLEEGED TO YOU I CAN TELL YOU
 I DIDN'T MEAN NO HARM
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE SEEMS TO CATCH HIS MEANING AND JUMPS FOR THE KING GOO-GOOING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT FOR JOY AND HUGS HIM ABOUT FIFTEEN TIMES BEFORE HE LETS UP
ROUND-LOG KITCHEN WITH A BIG BROAD OPEN BUT ROOFED PASSAGE JOINING IT TO THE HOUSE
 WHEN WE GOT PRETTY CLOSE TO THE CROSS-HALL DOOR THERE WAS THE SKIFF SURE ENOUGH
LET GO
ONE NIGHT WE CATCHED A LITTLE SECTION OF A LUMBER RAFTNICE PINE PLANKS
AND BOTH OF THEM LOOKED PRETTY SICK AND TOLERABLE SILLY
MISS MARY JANE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO STAY AT MR LOTHROP'S SO LONG NUTHER
 YOU MIGHT PUMP AT HIM A WEEK IT WOULDN'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
 BUT THE DUKE SAYS
 SIS NEVER WROTE TO ME ABOUT ANYBODY COMING BUT HIM IT'S BECAUSE IT WARN'T INTENDED FOR ANY OF US TO COME BUT TOM HE SAYS
AFTER SUPPER PAP TOOK THE JUG AND SAID HE HAD ENOUGH WHISKY THERE FOR TWO DRUNKS AND ONE DELIRIUM TREMENS
THERE WUZ HELP S'I
WELL SISTER PHELPS I'VE RANSACKED THAT-AIR CABIN OVER AN I B'LIEVE THE NIGGER WAS CRAZY
 THEN THE DUKE SAYS
 THEN THE DUKE SAYS
 THEN THE DUKE SAYS
I HAD BEEN TO SCHOOL MOST ALL THE TIME AND COULD SPELL AND READ AND WRITE JUST A LITTLE AND COULD SAY THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE UP TO SIX TIMES SEVEN IS THIRTY-FIVE AND I DON'T RECKON I COULD EVER GET ANY FURTHER THAN THAT IF I WAS TO LIVE FOREVER
FOR HE RESPECTED EVERYBODY HE LIKED EVERYBODY AND SO IT'S FITTEN THAT HIS FUNERAL ORGIES SH'D BE PUBLIC AND SO HE WENT A-MOONING ON AND ON LIKING TO HEAR HIMSELF TALK AND EVERY LITTLE WHILE HE FETCHED IN HIS FUNERAL ORGIES AGAIN TILL THE DUKE HE COULDN'T STAND IT NO MORE
SO THE KING WENT ALL THROUGH THE CROWD WITH HIS HAT SWABBING HIS EYES AND BLESSING THE PEOPLE AND PRAISING THEM AND THANKING THEM FOR BEING SO GOOD TO THE POOR PIRATES AWAY OFF THERE
IT MAKES SUCH A RUSTLING THAT YOU WAKE UP
 _HURRY  I SAYS
SO NOW SHE WAS CHURNING ALONG UP THE RIVER OUT OF SIGHT IN THE THICK WEATHER THOUGH I COULD HEAR HER
 HOW OLD IS THE OTHERS MARY JANE'S NINETEEN SUSAN'S FIFTEEN AND JOANNA'S ABOUT FOURTEENTHAT'S THE ONE THAT GIVES HERSELF TO GOOD WORKS AND HAS A HARE-LIP POOR THINGS
 ONE TIME TOM SENT A BOY TO RUN ABOUT TOWN WITH A BLAZING STICK WHICH HE CALLED A SLOGAN WHICH WAS THE SIGN FOR THE GANG TO GET TOGETHER AND THEN HE SAID HE HAD GOT SECRET NEWS BY HIS SPIES THAT NEXT DAY A WHOLE PARCEL OF SPANISH MERCHANTS AND RICH A-RABS WAS GOING TO CAMP IN CAVE HOLLOW WITH TWO HUNDRED ELEPHANTS AND SIX HUNDRED CAMELS AND OVER A THOUSAND SUMTER MULES ALL LOADED DOWN WITH DI'MONDS AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ONLY A GUARD OF FOUR HUNDRED SOLDIERS AND SO WE WOULD LAY IN AMBUSCADE AS HE CALLED IT AND KILL THE LOT AND SCOOP THE THINGS
AND JIM IN HER CALICO DRESS WITH HIS HANDS TIED BEHIND HIM
WELL HE WAS A PRETTY SICK MAN AND LIKELY HE MADE A MISTAKEI RECKON THAT'S THE WAY OF IT
AND WE GOT IT DONE AT LAST AND VERY SATISFACTORY TOO
AND EMMELINE THAT DIED
 ANOTHER WAS HENRY CLAY'S SPEECHES AND ANOTHER WAS DR GUNN'S FAMILY MEDICINE WHICH TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF A BODY WAS SICK OR DEAD
AFTER MIDNIGHT THE PEOPLE ON SHORE WENT TO BED AND THEN FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS THE SHORES WAS BLACKNO MORE SPARKS IN THE CABIN WINDOWS
BECAUSE I DON'T WISH TO GO BACK ON NO REGULATIONS
WELL I SAYS WHEN I SEE THE KING IN THAT DOGGERY YESTERDAY I SAYS TO MYSELF WE CAN'T GET HIM HOME FOR HOURS TILL HE'S SOBERER
 SHOVE!AND DON'T YOU LOSE A MINUTE
SO THE DUKE SAID IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO HAVE TO LAY ROPED ALL DAY AND HE'D CIPHER OUT SOME WAY TO GET AROUND IT
IT WAS ABOUT DARK NOW
 JIM KNOWED ALL KINDS OF SIGNS
IF YOU PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN
IT'S GAUDY HUCK
FOR WHO WOULD BEAR THE WHIPS AND SCORNS OF TIME THE OPPRESSOR'S WRONG THE PROUD MAN'S CONTUMELY THE LAW'S DELAY AND THE QUIETUS WHICH HIS PANGS MIGHT TAKE
THE HUT BY THE ASH HOPPER.OUTRAGEOUS.CLIMBING THE LIGHTNING ROD.TROUBLED WITH WITCHES
A STEAMBOAT RUN OVER THE FORRARD CORNER OF THE RAFT ONE NIGHT AND WE ALL WENT OVERBOARD AND DOVE UNDER THE WHEEL
BUT JIM WAS THERE SURE ENOUGH AND COULD SEE US
BUT JIM HE TOOK THE PICK AND SOON MADE IT BIG ENOUGH
THIS TIME I RECKON I STAYED UNDER A MINUTE AND A HALF
 AT YOUR AGE
A COAT OF ARMS IS VERY DIFFERENT WELL I SAYS JIM'S RIGHT ANYWAY WHEN HE SAYS HE AIN'T GOT NO COAT OF ARMS BECAUSE HE HAIN'T I RECKON I KNOWED THAT TOM SAYS BUT YOU BET HE'LL HAVE ONE BEFORE HE GOES OUT OF THISBECAUSE HE'S GOING OUT RIGHT AND THERE AIN'T GOING TO BE NO FLAWS IN HIS RECORD SO WHILST ME AND JIM FILED AWAY AT THE PENS ON A BRICKBAT APIECE JIM A-MAKING HIS'N OUT OF THE BRASS AND I MAKING MINE OUT OF THE SPOON TOM SET TO WORK TO THINK OUT THE COAT OF ARMS
AND I FOUND AN OLD SACK AND PUT THEM IN IT AND WE WENT DOWN AND GOT THE FOX-FIRE AND PUT THAT IN TOO
 SAID HE SWUM ALONG BEHIND ME THAT NIGHT AND HEARD ME YELL EVERY TIME BUT DASN'T ANSWER BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT NOBODY TO PICK HIM UP AND TAKE HIM INTO SLAVERY AGAIN
 BEFORE HE WAS T'OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER I WAS OUT OF THE HOLE
AND I K'N TELL A FORTUNE PRETTY GOOD WHEN I'VE GOT SOMEBODY ALONG TO FIND OUT THE FACTS FOR ME
 I WAS RIGHT ON HIM BEFORE I COULD SHIRK
JIM HE NEVER LET ON BUT WHAT IT WAS ONLY JUST A PIECE OF ROCK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S ALWAYS GETTING INTO BREAD YOU KNOW
 "I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS SO STIRRED UP SHE SAYS
 THEY STOOD THERE A-THINKING AND SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS A MINUTE AND THE DUKE HE BUST INTO A KIND OF A LITTLE RASPY CHUCKLE AND SAYS

 SAYS THE KING
 HE OUGHTER KNOW A BODY DON'T LOVE WATER-MOCCASINS ENOUGH TO GO AROUND HUNTING FOR THEM
AND BESIDES THIS WAS THE BACK OF THE CABIN AND IT WARN'T LIKELY ANYBODY WOULD GO FOOLING AROUND THERE
 HE'S GOT TO HAVE A ROPE LADDER
 ANYWAY HE SET THERE AND PRETTY SOON HE BEGUN TO SMILE AND SAYS
I SHOULD A RECKONED THE DIFFERENCE IN RANK WOULD A SEJESTED TO YOU THAT A CORN-SHUCK BED WARN'T JUST FITTEN FOR ME TO SLEEP ON
 WE NEVER STOPPED RUNNING TILL WE GOT HOME
BY AND BY ALONG COMES PART OF A LOG RAFTNINE LOGS FAST TOGETHER
 YOU ANSWER ME DAT I SEE IT WARN'T NO USE WASTING WORDSYOU CAN'T LEARN A NIGGER TO ARGUE
AND THERE WARN'T EVER ANYTHING COULD A WORKED BETTER
BUT I DIDN'T GET PRETTY FUR TILL THE DOCTOR BEGUN TO LAUGH
I DON'T BLAME ANYBODY
 "LE'S MAKE UP THE DEFFISIT AND HE BEGUN TO HAUL OUT YALLER-BOYS OUT OF HIS POCKET
 WELL I WAS UP THERE AND HE WAS UP THERE
 WHAT DID THEY DO
LOOK AT THAT NIGGER MADE OUT'N STRAW ON THE BED
 I'M ONE OF THEMBUT I HAIN'T TALKED IT AROUND
 I NEVER WENT NEAR THE HOUSE BUT STRUCK THROUGH THE WOODS AND MADE FOR THE SWAMP
 WHEN WE HAD MADE A STROKE OR TWO I SAYS
SO I HELD ON TILL ALL THE LATE SOUNDS HAD QUIT AND THE EARLY ONES HADN'T BEGUN YET
FOR HE BELIEVED JIM WOULD COME TO LIKE IT BETTER AND BETTER THE MORE HE GOT USED TO IT
 BUT WE DON'T WANT TO BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THIS WHOLE TOWN I RECKON AND NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF THIS THING AS LONG AS WE LIVE
NOBODY EVER SAW ANYTHING IN THE BOOKS LIKE THAT
HIM AND HIS WIFE BOTH DIED LAST YEAR
WHEN THEY GOT ABOARD THE KING WENT FOR ME AND SHOOK ME BY THE COLLAR AND SAYS
 I HAIN'T SEEN ANY SMOKE SENCE SO I RECKON MAYBE HE'S GONE IF IT WAS HIM

 AND THE SHIRT AIN'T ALL THAT'S GONE NUTHER
WELL THE SECOND NIGHT A FOG BEGUN TO COME ON AND WE MADE FOR A TOWHEAD TO TIE TO FOR IT WOULDN'T DO TO TRY TO RUN IN A FOG
 THE NIGGERS STOLE IT THE VERY NEXT MORNIN AFTER I HAD WENT DOWN STAIRS
 WHEN HE TURNED INTO A CLOUDBANK IT WAS AWFUL DARK FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THAT WAS ENOUGH
 THE CAVERN WAS AS BIG AS TWO OR THREE ROOMS BUNCHED TOGETHER AND JIM COULD STAND UP STRAIGHT IN IT
 HE AIN'T NO BAD NIGGER GENTLEMEN
YOU PAY ME BACK THE CHAWS YOU'VE AWREADY BORRY'D OFF'N ME LAFE BUCKNER THEN I'LL LOAN YOU ONE OR TWO TON OF IT AND WON'T CHARGE YOU NO BACK INTRUST NUTHER WELL I DID PAY YOU BACK SOME OF IT WUNST YES YOU DID'BOUT SIX CHAWS
 I WANT IT I HAIN'T GOT NO MONEY I TELL YOU
THE WIDOW SHE CRIED OVER ME AND CALLED ME A POOR LOST LAMB AND SHE CALLED ME A LOT OF OTHER NAMES TOO BUT SHE NEVER MEANT NO HARM BY IT
 STICK A CANDLE IN YOUR POCKET
 I HELD UP MY TWO HANDS AND SHE PUT THE HANK OVER THEM AND WENT ON TALKING ABOUT HER AND HER HUSBAND'S MATTERS
 AND SO IT TURNED OUT AND HE LET ON TO BE SID AND MADE THINGS AS SOFT AS HE COULD FOR ME
 WELL ABOUT THIS TIME HE WAS FOUND IN THE RIVER DROWNDED ABOUT TWELVE MILE ABOVE TOWN SO PEOPLE SAID
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME WITHOUT YOU HAVE READ A BOOK BY THE NAME OF THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER
THIS WAS ALL THERE WAS OF THE FAMILY NOW BUT THERE USED TO BE MORETHREE SONS
WELL PRETTY SOON THE WHOLE TOWN WAS THERE SQUIRMING AND SCROUGING AND PUSHING AND SHOVING TO GET AT THE WINDOW AND HAVE A LOOK BUT PEOPLE THAT HAD THE PLACES WOULDN'T GIVE THEM UP AND FOLKS BEHIND THEM WAS SAYING ALL THE TIME SAY NOW YOU'VE LOOKED ENOUGH YOU FELLOWS
IF THE MEN WENT TO THE ISLAND I JUST EXPECT THEY FOUND THE CAMP FIRE I BUILT AND WATCHED IT ALL NIGHT FOR JIM TO COME
BUT YOU CAN'T DEPEND ON THEM
AND ABOUT PETER'S BUSINESSWHICH WAS A TANNER
THEN HIM AND THE DUKE CRAWLED INTO THE WIGWAM AND TURNED IN FOR THE NIGHT
 I DON'T HEAR THE DOGS AND HORSES YET
 WHY I'D GIVE TWO DOLLARS TO HAVE IT READ TO ME
BUT SHE WAS ON MY MIND AND TOM WAS ON MY MIND SO I SLEPT VERY RESTLESS
 WE TRAMPED AND CLUMB AROUND ALL OVER IT AND BY AND BY FOUND A GOOD BIG CAVERN IN THE ROCK MOST UP TO THE TOP ON THE SIDE TOWARDS ILLINOIS
 SHE TOLD ME TO PRAY EVERY DAY AND WHATEVER I ASKED FOR I WOULD GET IT
 "I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE NOWHERE ELSE BUT HERE
 BUT IT OUGHTN'T TO BE ALTOGETHER MY FAULT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE THEM NOR HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM EXCEPT WHEN THEY'RE ON ME
WHEN YOU LANDED I RECK'NED I COULD KETCH UP WID YOU ON DE LAN DOUT HAVIN TO SHOUT AT YOU BUT WHEN I SEE DAT HOUSE I BEGIN TO GO SLOW
 HE SAID WE MUST SLICK UP OUR SWORDS AND GUNS AND GET READY
 THAT WAS WHERE IT PINCHED
WELL YOU GET ALL THE ENJOYMENT YOU CAN OUT OF IT NOW FOR MIND I TELL YOU IF I CATCH YOU MEDDLING WITH HIM AGAIN MEDDLING WITH WHO  TOM SAYS DROPPING HIS SMILE AND LOOKING SURPRISED
 THAT WAS A GOOD NOTION TOO
THE BOYS ESCAPE JIM.TORN SAWYER'S GANG.DEEP-LAID PLANS
 BUT IF THIS WOMAN HAD BEEN IN SUCH A LITTLE TOWN TWO DAYS SHE COULD TELL ME ALL I WANTED TO KNOW
 I COULDN'T GET THAT OUT OF MY CONSCIENCE NO HOW NOR NO WAY
 I DID MYSELF
 MY CONSCIENCE GOT TO STIRRING ME UP HOTTER THAN EVER UNTIL AT LAST I SAYS TO IT LET UP ON MEIT AIN'T TOO LATE YETI'LL PADDLE ASHORE AT THE FIRST LIGHT AND TELL  I FELT EASY AND HAPPY AND LIGHT AS A FEATHER RIGHT OFF
 JUST THEN I HEARD SOMEBODY COMING DOWN THE STAIRS BACK BEHIND ME
IT DID SEEM A POWERFUL LONG TIME BEFORE JIM'S LIGHT SHOWED UP
I COULDN'T BUDGE YOU WELL ALL RIGHT
SO I WENT A-LOAFING AROUND TOWN TO PUT IN THE TIME AND WAIT
BUT DEEP DOWN IN ME I KNOWED IT WAS A LIE AND HE KNOWED IT
ALL I COULD GET TO EAT WAS BERRIES AND WHAT WAS LEFT OVER FROM BREAKFAST
BLAME IT DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE AIN'T BUT ONE PREACHER TO A CHURCH WHY WHAT DO THEY WANT WITH MORE WHAT!TO PREACH BEFORE A KING
I RECKON IT'S ALL RIGHT
 I'VE SEEN IT IN BOOKS
 JIM'S THE PRISONER
BUT I SAY IT'S A FOOL WAY ANYHOW
 I SLIPPED UP AND PEEPED IN AT THE WINDOW
NO USE TO TAKE TRUCK AND LEAVE MONEY SAY WON'T HE SUSPICION WHAT WE'RE UP TO MAYBE HE WON'T
YES TOOLS FOR WHAT WHY TO DIG WITH
HE AIN'T NO SLAVE
 I DONE IT
THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO IT
 I COULD JUST BARELY SEE HER
 I DOAN KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT
 YOU MIGHT A SAID THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SAVED TIME WHEN SHE SAID THAT I SEE I WAS OUT OF THE WOODS AGAIN AND SO I WAS COMFORTABLE AND GLAD
I'VE BEEN REMISS
BUT JUST THEN I HEARD A VOICE WAIL OUT AND SAY
IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS JUST BORN FOR IT
 SET DOWN AND STAY WHERE YOU ARE
AND THERE WARN'T NO MORE SMILE TO HIM THAN THERE IS TO A HAM
IS DAT YOU HONEY
 BUT I S'POSE WE'VE GOT TO
 HOW DO THEY GET THEM WHY THEY RUB AN OLD TIN LAMP OR AN IRON RING AND THEN THE GENIES COME TEARING IN WITH THE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING A-RIPPING AROUND AND THE SMOKE A-ROLLING AND EVERYTHING THEY'RE TOLD TO DO THEY UP AND DO IT
 AND EVERY SECOND OR TWO THERE'D COME A GLARE THAT LIT UP THE WHITE-CAPS FOR A HALF A MILE AROUND AND YOU'D SEE THE ISLANDS LOOKING DUSTY THROUGH THE RAIN AND THE TREES THRASHING AROUND IN THE WIND
ALAS WHAT RE YOU ALASSIN ABOUT SAYS THE BALD-HEAD
AND AS FOR THE KING HE JUST GAZED AND GAZED DOWN SORROWFUL ON THEM NEW-COMERS LIKE IT GIVE HIM THE STOMACH-ACHE IN HIS VERY HEART TO THINK THERE COULD BE SUCH FRAUDS AND RASCALS IN THE WORLD
 SO I GOT A PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL ALL GLAD AND EXCITED AND SET DOWN AND WROTE
EVERYTHING AS STILL AS A MOUSE
 BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
 WHEN I GOT THERE AND SEE IT WAS GONE I SAYS TO MYSELF THEY'VE GOT INTO TROUBLE AND HAD TO LEAVE
 AND WHAT DO YOU RECKON THEY SAID
OUTSIDE OF THE FENCE A GARDEN AND A WATERMELON PATCH
AND THE WIND WAS TRYING TO WHISPER SOMETHING TO ME AND I COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT IT WAS AND SO IT MADE THE COLD SHIVERS RUN OVER ME
YOU SEE THAT AXE GO UP AGAIN AND BY THE TIME IT'S ABOVE THE MAN'S HEAD THEN YOU HEAR THE K'CHUNK_!IT HAD TOOK ALL THAT TIME TO COME OVER THE WATER
HE SAID SOMETIMES IT WOULDN'T TALK WITHOUT MONEY

I'M A-GOING TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
 SO HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING
 SO SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SET UP ALL NIGHT AND NEVER GET ANY SLEEP JUST SO AS TO WATCH THEM
 JIM ALWAYS KEPT THAT FIVE-CENTER PIECE ROUND HIS NECK WITH A STRING AND SAID IT WAS A CHARM THE DEVIL GIVE TO HIM WITH HIS OWN HANDS AND TOLD HIM HE COULD CURE ANYBODY WITH IT AND FETCH WITCHES WHENEVER HE WANTED TO JUST BY SAYING SOMETHING TO IT
 MISS HOOKER WAS A-VISITING UP THERE TO THE TOWN YES BOOTH'S LANDINGGO ON SHE WAS A-VISITING THERE AT BOOTH'S LANDING AND JUST IN THE EDGE OF THE EVENING SHE STARTED OVER WITH HER NIGGER WOMAN IN THE HORSE-FERRY TO STAY ALL NIGHT AT HER FRIEND'S HOUSE MISS WHAT-YOU-MAY-CALL-HER I DISREMEMBER HER NAMEAND THEY LOST THEIR STEERING-OAR AND SWUNG AROUND AND WENT A-FLOATING DOWN STERN FIRST ABOUT TWO MILE AND SADDLE-BAGGSED ON THE WRECK AND THE FERRYMAN AND THE NIGGER WOMAN AND THE HORSES WAS ALL LOST BUT MISS HOOKER SHE MADE A GRAB AND GOT ABOARD THE WRECK
 I NEVER SEE PAP WHEN HE DIDN'T WANT THE CHICKEN HIMSELF BUT THAT IS WHAT HE USED TO SAY ANYWAY
 BUT HE SAID HE WAS SATISFIED
 YOU COULD TAME IT TAME IT YESEASY ENOUGH
BUT NOT LONG BECAUSE SHE SAYS
 WHEN I GOT BACK WITH THE DUKE WE HID THE CANOE AND THEN THEY SET DOWN ON A LOG AND THE KING TOLD HIM EVERYTHING JUST LIKE THE YOUNG FELLOW HAD SAID ITEVERY LAST WORD OF IT
 SO DON'T MAKE NO MORE FUSS ABOUT IT
HE CAN'T FORD IT
 ABOUT AN HOUR OR TWO AGO IT WOULD A BEEN A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT NOW IT MADE ME FEEL BAD AND DISAPPOINTED THE KING RIPS OUT AND SAYS
 JIM SMELT IT AND BIT IT AND RUBBED IT AND SAID HE WOULD MANAGE SO THE HAIR-BALL WOULD THINK IT WAS GOOD
 THERE WAS A YELL AT US AND A JINGLING OF BELLS TO STOP THE ENGINES A POWWOW OF CUSSING AND WHISTLING OF STEAMAND AS JIM WENT OVERBOARD ON ONE SIDE AND I ON THE OTHER SHE COME SMASHING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE RAFT
 I'M LOW DOWN
STARCHY CLOTHESVERY
STILL THE KING ACTED REAL FRIENDLY TOWARDS HIM AND SAID THE DUKE'S GREAT-GRANDFATHER AND ALL THE OTHER DUKES OF BILGEWATER WAS A GOOD DEAL THOUGHT OF BY HIS FATHER AND WAS ALLOWED TO COME TO THE PALACE CONSIDERABLE
THEN I STRUCK UP THE ROAD AND WHEN I PASSED THE MILL I SEE A SIGN ON IT PHELPS'S SAWMILL AND WHEN I COME TO THE FARM-HOUSES TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER ALONG I KEPT MY EYES PEELED BUT DIDN'T SEE NOBODY AROUND THOUGH IT WAS GOOD DAYLIGHT NOW
 AND THERE WARN'T A BLESSED SNAKE UP THERE WHEN WE WENT BACKWE DIDN'T HALF TIE THE SACK AND THEY WORKED OUT SOMEHOW AND LEFT
 HUCK CAN COME IN THEN THEY ALL STUCK A PIN IN THEIR FINGERS TO GET BLOOD TO SIGN WITH AND I MADE MY MARK ON THE PAPER
AND I'D A WADED NECK-DEEP IN BLOOD TOGOODNESS ALIVE AUNT POLLY IF SHE WARN'T STANDING RIGHT THERE JUST INSIDE THE DOOR LOOKING AS SWEET AND CONTENTED AS AN ANGEL HALF FULL OF PIE I WISH I MAY NEVER
 AND THEN MOSEY RIGHT DOWN THE LIGHTNING-ROD AND COME ALONG
 YOU ANSWER ME DAT WELL THIS IS TOO MANY FOR ME JIM
 SHE LOOKED ME ALL OVER WITH HER LITTLE SHINY EYES AND SAYS
DON'T IT S'PRISE YOU DE WAY DEM KINGS CARRIES ON HUCK NO I SAYS IT DON'T WHY DON'T IT HUCK WELL IT DON'T BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BREED
NOW WE'LL START THIS BAND OF ROBBERS AND CALL IT TOM SAWYER'S GANG
AND WHEN THEY SEE IT WARN'T NOBODY BUT US AND NO EXCITEMENT TO OFFER THEM THEY ONLY JUST SAID HOWDY AND TORE RIGHT AHEAD TOWARDS THE SHOUTING AND CLATTERING
 I WAS IN A SWEAT THEN AND WATCHED HIM PRETTY KEEN
SO AT LAST I RECKONED I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT ANY MORE BUT JUST LET IT GO

AND HE ALWAYS DONE IT

CIVILIZING HUCK.MISS WATSON.TOM SAWYER WAITS
THEN I GOT MY GUN AND SLIPPED OUT AND INTO THE EDGE OF THE WOODS
HE WAS UNCOMMON BRIGHT THE DUKE WAS AND HE SOON STRUCK IT
 THERE WAS A COUPLE OF BIG WILD-TURKEY-WING FANS SPREAD OUT BEHIND THOSE THINGS
BUT JIM DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT
 BUCK SAID SHE COULD RATTLE OFF POETRY LIKE NOTHING
 NOW THE WAY I LOOK AT IT A HICKRY-BARK LADDER DON'T COST NOTHING AND DON'T WASTE NOTHING AND IS JUST AS GOOD TO LOAD UP A PIE WITH AND HIDE IN A STRAW TICK AS ANY RAG LADDER YOU CAN START
HE SAID A MAN THAT WARN'T BURIED WAS MORE LIKELY TO GO A-HA'NTING AROUND THAN ONE THAT WAS PLANTED AND COMFORTABLE
MY BUT THERE WAS A CROWD THERE
ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER DINNER EVERYBODY WAS DOZING AROUND SOME IN THEIR CHAIRS AND SOME IN THEIR ROOMS AND IT GOT TO BE PRETTY DULL
RICHMOND
THEN I COVERED UP THEIR FACES AND GOT AWAY AS QUICK AS I COULD
 THERE AIN'T NO HARM IN IT
 A SCOW OR A RAFT WENT BY SO CLOSE WE COULD HEAR THEM TALKING AND CUSSING AND LAUGHINGHEARD THEM PLAIN
THE NIGGER RUN OFF THE VERY NIGHT HUCK FINN WAS KILLED
 I'D MADE UP MY MINE BOUT WHAT I'S AGWYNE TO DO
 IT WAS A TUESDAY THAT WE HAD THAT TALK
TOM SAID THAT WHAT HE MEANT WAS WE COULD STEAL ANYTHING WE NEEDED
NEW COSTUMES NEW SCENERY NEW APPOINTMENTS
IT WAS BEHIND ME YET BUT IN A DIFFERENT PLACE
 LOLL AROUND PASS THE PLATEAND ONE THING OR ANOTHER
HOW THAT SNAG'S TEARING ALONG
 HE LEANED HIS BACK UP AGAINST A TREE AND STRETCHED HIS LEGS OUT TILL ONE OF THEM MOST TOUCHED ONE OF MINE
 WHY THAT OLD MAN KEP UP HIS END IN A FIGHT ONE DAY FOR HALF AN HOUR AGAINST THREE GRANGERFORDS AND COME OUT WINNER
BUT IT WARN'T NO USEOLD JIM WAS GONE
 AND WHEN YOU THROW AT A RAT OR ANYTHING HITCH YOURSELF UP A TIPTOE AND FETCH YOUR HAND UP OVER YOUR HEAD AS AWKWARD AS YOU CAN AND MISS YOUR RAT ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN FOOT
AND SHE SHOOK ME BY THE HAND HARD AND SAYS
 AND DON'T YOU FOOL AROUND ANY BECAUSE HE'LL WANT TO KNOW THE NEWS
 WHERE ARE THEY ON THE WRECK WHAT WRECK WHY THERE AIN'T BUT ONE WHAT YOU DON'T MEAN THE WALTER SCOTT YES GOOD LAND
AND TOWARDS DAYLIGHT HE CRAWLED OUT AGAIN DRUNK AS A FIDDLER AND ROLLED OFF THE PORCH AND BROKE HIS LEFT ARM IN TWO PLACES AND WAS MOST FROZE TO DEATH WHEN SOMEBODY FOUND HIM AFTER SUN-UP
 NO SIGN OF A BOAT
DOAN LE'S TALK ABOUT IT HUCK
WE STAYED IN THE WIGWAM AND LET THE RAFT TAKE CARE OF ITSELF
 BUT THIS TIME YOU'VE SAID IT JEST ONE TIME TOO MANY
 BUT YOU TAKE A MAN DAT'S GOT BOUT FIVE MILLION CHILLEN RUNNIN ROUN DE HOUSE EN IT'S DIFFUNT

 JIM SAID BEES WOULDN'T STING IDIOTS

 _THAT'S WHER TIS
HE'LL TELL YOU THE SAME ALL RIGHT
THAT NIGHT THEY HAD A BIG SUPPER AND ALL THEM MEN AND WOMEN WAS THERE AND I STOOD BEHIND THE KING AND THE DUKE'S CHAIRS AND WAITED ON THEM AND THE NIGGERS WAITED ON THE REST
 SHUT UP ON A WRECK WITH SUCH A GANG AS THAT
RUN HER NOSE IN SHORE SAYS THE KING
AND THE KING HE LAUGHS AND BLETHERS OUT
THEY GOT KILLED
WE COULD HEAR HER POUNDING ALONG BUT WE DIDN'T SEE HER GOOD TILL SHE WAS CLOSE
 BUT IT'LL BE LOVELY
AUNT SALLY SHE WAS ONE OF THE MIXED-UPEST-LOOKING PERSONS I EVER SEEEXCEPT ONE AND THAT WAS UNCLE SILAS WHEN HE COME IN AND THEY TOLD IT ALL TO HIM
 DO YOU RECKON YOU CAN GO AND FACE YOUR UNCLES WHEN THEY COME TO KISS YOU GOOD-MORNING AND NEVER THERE THERE DON'T
WHY HOW YOU TALK SAYS THE KING
AND AT LAST WHEN IT HIT ME ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT HERE WAS THE PLAIN HAND OF PROVIDENCE SLAPPING ME IN THE FACE AND LETTING ME KNOW MY WICKEDNESS WAS BEING WATCHED ALL THE TIME FROM UP THERE IN HEAVEN WHILST I WAS STEALING A POOR OLD WOMAN'S NIGGER THAT HADN'T EVER DONE ME NO HARM AND NOW WAS SHOWING ME THERE'S ONE THAT'S ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT AND AIN'T A-GOING TO ALLOW NO SUCH MISERABLE DOINGS TO GO ONLY JUST SO FUR AND NO FURTHER I MOST DROPPED IN MY TRACKS I WAS SO SCARED

LOOKY HERE BILGEWATER WHAT'R YOU REFERRIN TO THE DUKE SAYS PRETTY BRISK
THE PRICE OF THE PAPER WAS TWO DOLLARS A YEAR BUT HE TOOK IN THREE SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR HALF A DOLLAR APIECE ON CONDITION OF THEM PAYING HIM IN ADVANCE
 I WENT OUT IN THE WOODS AND COOKED A SUPPER AND I HAD ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND I WOULD STAY THERE ALL NIGHT WHEN I HEAR A PLUNKETY-PLUNK PLUNKETY-PLUNK AND SAYS TO MYSELF HORSES COMING
 AND WHEN IT COMES TO BEAUTYAND GOODNESS TOOSHE LAYS OVER THEM ALL
 MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING AIN'T STRAIGHT ABOUT IT BUT IT IS THOUGHSTRAIGHT AS A STRING
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT IN THE WORLD TO MAKE OF IT
3
I HAIN'T EVER GOIN TO TELL AND EVERY TIME HE SAID THAT THE MAN WITH THE LANTERN WOULD LAUGH AND SAY
FOR SAYS I A SAILOR'S LIFE'S THE LIFE FOR ME AND I'M DERNED IF I'D LIVE TWO MILE OUT O TOWN WHERE THERE AIN'T NOTHING EVER GOIN ON NOT FOR ALL HIS SPONDULICKS AND AS MUCH MORE ON TOP OF IT
AND HAD A CHARACTER TO LOSE
NEXT HE WOULD SQUEEZE HIS HAND ON HIS FOREHEAD AND STAGGER BACK AND KIND OF MOAN
AND LOOK AT YOU MAY WELL SAY IT BRER HIGHTOWER
THE CALF GOT THE SHIRT I RECKON BUT THE CALF NEVER TOOK THE SPOON THAT'S CERTAIN WHY WHAT ELSE IS GONE SALLY THER'S SIX CANDLES GONETHAT'S WHAT
AND DON'T COME NIGH ME AGAIN TILL I'VE GOT BACK MY PEACE OF MIND I'D A HEARD HER IF SHE'D A SAID IT TO HERSELF LET ALONE SPEAKING IT OUT
AND EVERYBODY LEFT ANYWAY BEFORE THE SHOW WAS OVER BUT ONE BOY WHICH WAS ASLEEP
GIVE IT HERE I HAD CONSIDERABLE MONEY SO I GIVE HIM TEN CENTS BUT BEGGED HIM TO SPEND IT FOR SOMETHING TO EAT AND GIVE ME SOME BECAUSE IT WAS ALL THE MONEY I HAD AND I HADN'T HAD NOTHING TO EAT SINCE YESTERDAY
SO I WAS FULL OF TROUBLE FULL AS I COULD BE
SO WAS HER SISTER MISS SOPHIA BUT IT WAS A DIFFERENT KIND
CHILDREN AND SERVANTS 10 CENTS
AND WHEN I BEGUN TO GET TOWARDS OUR HOUSE I AIMED MY EYE AND SET IT
 SHE SAID DON'T SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE PROCTORS BUT ONLY ABOUT THE APTHORPSWHICH LL BE PERFECTLY TRUE BECAUSE SHE IS GOING THERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THEIR BUYING THE HOUSE
 THAT DOCTOR LAYS ON MY MIND
 I THINK IT'S OUR DUTY TO SEE THAT THEY DON'T GET AWAY FROM HERE TILL WE'VE LOOKED INTO THIS THING
SAYS I TO MYSELF AND THIS IS ANOTHER ONE THAT I'M LETTING HIM ROB HER OF HER MONEY
AIN DAT MISTO TOM I JUST KNOWED HOW IT WOULD BE
 JUMP FOR THE WOODS WE DONE IT AND THEN PEEPED DOWN THE WOODS THROUGH THE LEAVES
 WE LAID OUT TO DO IT AND WE DONE IT
HE DON'T MEAN NOTHING
 AND MIND YOU EVERYBODY WAS DOING THE SAME
 YOU BETTER HAVE THE LEAD IN YOUR LAP HANDY SO SHE DROPPED THE LUMP INTO MY LAP JUST AT THAT MOMENT AND I CLAPPED MY LEGS TOGETHER ON IT AND SHE WENT ON TALKING
 MARY JANE WAS RED-HEADED BUT THAT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE SHE WAS MOST AWFUL BEAUTIFUL AND HER FACE AND HER EYES WAS ALL LIT UP LIKE GLORY SHE WAS SO GLAD HER UNCLES WAS COME
 YOU SLIDE IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND HOOK THAT YALLER GIRL'S FROCK WHY TOM THAT LL MAKE TROUBLE NEXT MORNING
THEY WILL SNEAK DOWN FROM NORTHARDS ALONG THE FENCE AT MIDNIGHT EXACT WITH A FALSE KEY AND GO IN THE NIGGER'S CABIN TO GET HIM
 "WE CAN EASY FIND OUT IF IT'S JIM IN THERE
 JIM SAID HE HADN'T EVER SEEN A BIGGER ONE
THEN WE LIT UP AND HAD A SUPPER AND THE KING AND THE DUKE FAIRLY LAUGHED THEIR BONES LOOSE OVER THE WAY THEY'D SERVED THEM PEOPLE
 THE MAN THAT HAD A-HOLT OF ME WAS VERY GOOD TO ME AND KEPT SAYING HE HAD A BOY ABOUT AS BIG AS ME THAT DIED LAST YEAR AND HE WAS SORRY TO SEE A BOY IN SUCH A DANGEROUS FIX
 I COULD SEE THE SUN OUT AT ONE OR TWO HOLES BUT MOSTLY IT WAS BIG TREES ALL ABOUT AND GLOOMY IN THERE AMONGST THEM
PAP AND MAM AND SIS AND THEN I BROKE DOWN
 BY RIGHTS I AM A DUKE JIM'S EYES BUGGED OUT WHEN HE HEARD THAT
BUT HE SAID IT WARN'T NO USE NOTHING BUT TO BE DEAD AND DONE WITH IT ALL COULD DO HIM ANY GOOD
 TROUBLE IS BREWING
 I RECK'N I BETTER KEEP DE ANIMALS SATISFIED EN NOT HAVE NO TROUBLE IN DE HOUSE TOM WAITED TO THINK IT OVER AND SEE IF THERE WASN'T NOTHING ELSE
 AND WHEN THEY COME TO LOOK AT THAT SPARE ROOM THEY HAD TO TAKE SOUNDINGS BEFORE THEY COULD NAVIGATE IT
 BUT HE SAID I DIDN'T NEED IT TO GET OUT OF PRISON WITH
 WHY HE DIDN'T ONLY LOOK LIKE HE WAS DEAD HE LOOKED CONSIDERABLE MORE THAN THAT
 WHEN WE GOT TO THE CABIN WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE FRONT AND THE TWO SIDES
 AND MORE
 AND THEY'LL JUST FAIRLY SWARM OVER YOU AND HAVE A NOBLE GOOD TIME YES DEY WILL I RECK'N MARS TOM BUT WHAT KINE ER TIME IS JIM HAVIN
 I WONDER WHO TIS
NOW SAYS BEN ROGERS WHAT'S THE LINE OF BUSINESS OF THIS GANG NOTHING ONLY ROBBERY AND MURDER TOM SAID
 TWO YEARS AGO LAST CHRISTMAS YOUR UNCLE SILAS WAS COMING UP FROM NEWRLEANS ON THE OLD LALLY ROOK AND SHE BLOWED OUT A CYLINDER-HEAD AND CRIPPLED A MAN
 I GOT SOME OF THEIR JABBER OUT OF A BOOK
AND THEN WE WAS PLUMB PLAYED OUT AND MOST DROWNDED WITH SWEAT
 A PERSON DOES A LOW-DOWN THING AND THEN HE DON'T WANT TO TAKE NO CONSEQUENCES OF IT
 HE TOLD US TO GIVE ATTENTION
 WE SMOUCHED THE GRINDSTONE AND SET OUT TO ROLL HER HOME BUT IT WAS A MOST NATION TOUGH JOB
 I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW HOW THEY'RE PUTTING IN THEIR OPPORTUNITY
AND AS I SHOVED OFF HE SAYS
 SHUT THE DOOR AND BLINDFOLD THE DOCTOR TIGHT AND FAST AND MAKE HIM SWEAR TO BE SILENT AS THE GRAVE AND PUT A PURSE FULL OF GOLD IN HIS HAND AND THEN TAKE AND LEAD HIM ALL AROUND THE BACK ALLEYS AND EVERYWHERES IN THE DARK AND THEN FETCH HIM HERE IN THE CANOE IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY AMONGST THE ISLANDS AND SEARCH HIM AND TAKE HIS CHALK AWAY FROM HIM AND DON'T GIVE IT BACK TO HIM TILL YOU GET HIM BACK TO THE VILLAGE OR ELSE HE WILL CHALK THIS RAFT SO HE CAN FIND IT AGAIN
THEN THE BALDHEAD SAYS
 PRETTY SOON IT DARKENED UP AND BEGUN TO THUNDER AND LIGHTEN
THEN WE WENT LOAFING AROUND THE TOWN
 WHEN WE WAS THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE BELOW WE HOISTED UP OUR SIGNAL LANTERN
 "KEEP AWAY BOYKEEP TO LOOARD
WHO DONE IT
 I KNOW YOU DO KNOW BECAUSE YOU DONE IT YOURSELF IT'S A LIE!"AND THE DUKE WENT FOR HIM
 TOM SEE HIM DO IT AND REMEMBERED ABOUT THE SPOON AND SAYS
 THERE NOW WE'RE OVER THE WORST OF IT YOU CAN STAND THE REST MIDDLING EASY IT JOLTED HER UP LIKE EVERYTHING OF COURSE
 THERE WARN'T NO WAY BUT TO WAIT FOR DARK AND START BACK IN THE CANOE AND TAKE THE CHANCES
FOSTERAND HE LIVES FORTY MILE BACK HERE IN THE COUNTRY ON THE ROAD TO LAFAYETTE ALL RIGHT I SAYS I CAN WALK IT IN THREE DAYS
AND I AS HIGH AS A TREE AND AS BIG AS A CHURCH
BUT WE WOULDN'T LET HIM
 A BIG DOUBLE LOAF COME ALONG AND I MOST GOT IT WITH A LONG STICK BUT MY FOOT SLIPPED AND SHE FLOATED OUT FURTHER
SO WHEN HE DIED I TOOK WHAT THERE WAS LEFT BECAUSE THE FARM DIDN'T BELONG TO US AND STARTED UP THE RIVER DECK PASSAGE AND FELL OVERBOARD
AND DON'T YOU LOSE ANY TIME ABOUT IT NEITHER NOR DO ANY GABBLING BY THE WAY
WE BETTER CAMP HERE IF WE CAN FIND A GOOD PLACE
I DIDN KNOW DEY WAS SO MANY UN UM
THEY HAVEN'T COMETHE DOOR IS LOCKED
AND AT LAST STILL TALKING ALONG HE REACHED OVER AND KISSED AUNT SALLY RIGHT ON THE MOUTH AND THEN SETTLED BACK AGAIN IN HIS CHAIR COMFORTABLE AND WAS GOING ON TALKING
I MAKE THIS EXPLANATION FOR THE REASON THAT WITHOUT IT MANY READERS WOULD SUPPOSE THAT ALL THESE CHARACTERS WERE TRYING TO TALK ALIKE AND NOT SUCCEEDING
 THER'S A SPOON GONE
AND IF WE'D A HAD HIM ALONG STEAD OF OUR KINGS HE'D A FOOLED THAT TOWN A HEAP WORSE THAN OURN DONE
 YOU MUST STAY
 AND HE SAID THAT BETWEEN THE RATS AND THE SNAKES AND THE GRINDSTONE THERE WARN'T NO ROOM IN BED FOR HIM SKASELY
BEGONE SAH AND SHE FETCHED FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER OF THEM A CLIP AND SENT THEM HOWLING AND THEN THE REST FOLLOWED
WHAT GOT YOU INTO TROUBLE SAYS THE BALDHEAD TO T'OTHER CHAP
CHAPTER XXX
CHAPTER XXX
 AND COULDN'T THE NIGGER SEE BETTER TOO
 THEY SAID HE WAS A P'FESSOR IN A COLLEGE AND COULD TALK ALL KINDS OF LANGUAGES AND KNOWED EVERYTHING
 I SAID I RECKONED I WOULD SLIP OVER THE RIVER AND FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON
 HE SAID HE COULD SIZE THEIR STYLE
 WE'VE HEARD CONSIDERABLE ABOUT THESE GOINGS ON DOWN IN HOOKERVILLE BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHO TWAS THAT KILLED HUCK FINN WELL I RECKON THERE'S A RIGHT SMART CHANCE OF PEOPLE HERE THAT'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO KILLED HIM

DAH NOW HUCK WHAT I TELL YOU?WHAT I TELL YOU UP DAH ON JACKSON ISLAN
OR WHAT I WANT IS MY WATERMELON
   ALAS IT WAS TOO LATE
 WHAT MADE YOU THINK SOMEBODY SUNG OUT OH IT'S DE DAD-BLAME WITCHES SAH EN I WISHT I WAS DEAD I DO
AND WE WOULD TIE THINGS TO AUNT'S APRON-STRINGS OR PUT THEM IN HER APRON-POCKET IF WE GOT A CHANCE
 I RECKON IT WOULDN'T DO NO GOOD AND SO HE WENT ON A-MUMBLING UP STAIRS AND THEN WE LEFT
 IT'S ONLY SAYING DO YOU KNOW HOW TO TALK FRENCH WELL DEN WHY COULDN'T HE SAY IT WHY HE IS A-SAYING IT
ESCAPING PROPERLY.DARK SCHEMES.DISCRIMINATION IN STEALING.A DEEP HOLE
 HE SAID HE RECKONED A BODY COULD REFORM THE OLD MAN WITH A SHOTGUN MAYBE BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW NO OTHER WAY
AND IF WE DON'T FIND THEM MARKS WE'LL LYNCH THE WHOLE GANG I WAS SCARED NOW I TELL YOU
BY AND BY THE MEN STOPPED CAVORTING AROUND AND YELLING
 OLD MRS HOTCHKISS WAS THE WORST
MAYBE I BETTER NOT TELL WHY JIM WELL DEY'S REASONS
 HE SAID IT WARN'T NO USE TALKING HEATHENS DON'T AMOUNT TO SHUCKS ALONGSIDE OF PIRATES TO WORK A CAMP-MEETING WITH
 I GOT SO FULL OF IT I DIDN'T NOTICE HOW LONG I WAS STAYING TILL THE OLD MAN HOLLERED AND ASKED ME WHETHER I WAS ASLEEP OR DROWNDED
YES WE DID CONSIDER HIM SOGOODNESS KNOWS WE HAD TROUBLE ENOUGH FOR HIM
COME IN YOUR RAGS AND SIN AND DIRT
 DEN I SWUM TO DE STERN UV IT EN TUCK A-HOLT
 I'VE GOT A DOGAND HE'LL GO IN THE RIVER AND BRING OUT CHIPS THAT YOU THROW IN
 HE WAS THE EASIEST NIGGER TO LAUGH THAT EVER WAS ANYWAY
SO THEY DUG AND DUG LIKE EVERYTHING
THE THING MADE A BIG STIR IN THE TOWN TOO AND A GOOD MANY COME OUT FLATFOOTED AND SAID IT WAS SCANDALOUS TO SEPARATE THE MOTHER AND THE CHILDREN THAT WAY
 GRANGERFORD WAS A GENTLEMAN YOU SEE
BUT I AIN'T GOING TO MAKE NO COMPLAINT
 SO AT LAST THEY GOT JUST ABOUT DEAD BROKE AND LAID AROUND THE RAFT AS SHE FLOATED ALONG THINKING AND THINKING AND NEVER SAYING NOTHING BY THE HALF A DAY AT A TIME AND DREADFUL BLUE AND DESPERATE
 I SHOULD HOPE WE CAN FIND A WAY THAT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT HUCK FINN WELL THEN I SAYS HOW LL IT DO TO SAW HIM OUT THE WAY I DONE BEFORE I WAS MURDERED THAT TIME THAT'S MORE LIKE HE SAYS
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE NO QUARRELS AND DON'T GET INTO NO TROUBLE

SHERBURN NEVER SAID A WORDJUST STOOD THERE LOOKING DOWN
I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HIM NO MORE
 I ON'Y LOS BOUT NINE OF IT

 I HAD TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY HANDS

 PA WAS PRETTY POOR AND HAD SOME DEBTS
WHERE WAS HE WHY HE WAS IN THE DARK
THE MEN TOOK THEIR GUNS ALONG SO DID BUCK AND KEPT THEM BETWEEN THEIR KNEES OR STOOD THEM HANDY AGAINST THE WALL
AND TOLD HIM TO SELL OUT AS QUICK AS HE WANTED TO THEY WOULD BE READY
CAN BEAR IT WE GOT AWAY AS SOON AS IT WAS GOOD AND DARK
IT WAS FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE I COULD WORK MYSELF UP TO GO AND HUMBLE MYSELF TO A NIGGER
 HOW YOU TALK YOU BETTER SAY
 WHY DON'T YOUR JURIES HANG MURDERERS
 WHAT HE GWYNE TO DO WELL I DON'T KNOW
 A SERVANT AIN'T NOBODY THERE
 SHE SAID IT WAS A MEAN PRACTICE AND WASN'T CLEAN AND I MUST TRY TO NOT DO IT ANY MORE
 OF COURSE I JUDGED HE MUST BE A RUNAWAY NIGGER AND THERE I WAS
N WHO MY VERY WORDS BRER PENROD
IT AIN'T NATURAL FOR A GIRL TO BE IN SUCH A SWEAT ABOUT A TESTAMENT
MUMPS MUMPS YOUR GRANNY
IT WAS JUST DARK NOW
BUT THE WIDOW SHE DIDN'T SCOLD BUT ONLY CLEANED OFF THE GREASE AND CLAY AND LOOKED SO SORRY THAT I THOUGHT I WOULD BEHAVE AWHILE IF I COULD
NOT A CLOUD IN IT
 IT'S A NEW KIND MISS MARY JANE SAID HOW'S IT A NEW KIND BECAUSE IT'S MIXED UP WITH OTHER THINGS WHAT OTHER THINGS WELL MEASLES AND WHOOPING-COUGH AND ERYSIPLAS AND CONSUMPTION AND YALLER JANDERS AND BRAIN-FEVER AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL MY LAND
 BUT IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE YET SO WE MADE THE CANOE FAST AND SET IN HER TO WAIT FOR DAYLIGHT
 WELL I WARN'T LONG LOOSING THE WHOOPS DOWN AMONGST THE TOWHEADS
 _WHERE'S IT GONE LIZE CLAH TO GOODNESS I HAIN'T NO NOTION MISS SALLY
 WELL I WAS GETTING TO FEEL THAT WAY MYSELF THOUGH I'VE ALWAYS RECKONED THAT LOOKING AT THE NEW MOON OVER YOUR LEFT SHOULDER IS ONE OF THE CARELESSEST AND FOOLISHEST THINGS A BODY CAN DO
 HE JUST STOOD UP THERE A-SAILING AROUND AS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AS IF HE WARN'T EVER DRUNK IN HIS LIFEAND THEN HE BEGUN TO PULL OFF HIS CLOTHES AND SLING THEM
 PLEASE TO DON'T TELL NOBODY BOUT IT SAH ER OLE MARS SILAS HE'LL SCOLE ME
SO I DROPPED THE CANOE DOWN THE RIVER UNDER SOME WILLOWS THAT HUNG OVER THE BANK AND WAITED FOR THE MOON TO RISE
 YOUR PAP'S GOT THE SMALL-POX AND YOU KNOW IT PRECIOUS WELL
 I PASSED THE LINE AROUND ONE OF THEM RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE CUT BANK BUT THERE WAS A STIFF CURRENT AND THE RAFT COME BOOMING DOWN SO LIVELY SHE TORE IT OUT BY THE ROOTS AND AWAY SHE WENT
ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK WE TURNED OUT AND WENT ALONG UP THE BANK
AND OTHERS WAS TRYING TO GET THEM TO HOLD ON AND WAIT FOR THE SHEEP-SIGNAL
WE PASSED ANOTHER TOWN BEFORE DAYLIGHT AND I WAS GOING OUT AGAIN
 HE CAN HIDE IT IN HIS BED CAN'T HE  THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL DO
 HERE ARE THE COSTUMES FOR THE PARTS HE GOT OUT TWO OR THREE CURTAIN-CALICO SUITS WHICH HE SAID WAS MEEDYEVIL ARMOR FOR RICHARD III
 DON'T STOP NOW
 EVERY LITTLE WHILE HE LOCKED ME IN AND WENT DOWN TO THE STORE THREE MILES TO THE FERRY AND TRADED FISH AND GAME FOR WHISKY AND FETCHED IT HOME AND GOT DRUNK AND HAD A GOOD TIME AND LICKED ME
I SEE HIM FIRST
 IT LL TAKE ABOUT A WEEK THEN WE STARTED FOR THE HOUSE AND I WENT IN THE BACK DOORYOU ONLY HAVE TO PULL A BUCKSKIN LATCH-STRING THEY DON'T FASTEN THE DOORSBUT THAT WARN'T ROMANTICAL ENOUGH FOR TOM SAWYER
 WE'LL FETCH YOU A LITTLE ONE AND YOU PLANT IT IN THE CORNER OVER THERE AND RAISE IT
 TOM SAID HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND JIM'S BED NOW AND WE'D DIG IN UNDER IT AND WHEN WE GOT THROUGH THERE COULDN'T NOBODY IN THE CABIN EVER KNOW THERE WAS ANY HOLE THERE BECAUSE JIM'S COUNTER-PIN HUNG DOWN MOST TO THE GROUND AND YOU'D HAVE TO RAISE IT UP AND LOOK UNDER TO SEE THE HOLE
 YOU GIT IT
 BUT BEFORE NIGHT THEY CHANGED AROUND AND JUDGED IT WAS DONE BY A RUNAWAY NIGGER NAMED JIM WHY HE_ I STOPPED
 I THOUGHT I WAS A GONER FOR WHENEVER ANYBODY WAS AFTER ANYBODY I JUDGED IT WAS ME_OR MAYBE JIM
CHAPTER XXXVIII

 WE PUT THE LOT INTO THE CANOEIT MIGHT COME GOOD
YES AND I TOLD EM SO
 AND THAT LETTER WAS ALL THEY COULD GET HIM TO PUT A PEN TO WHY DO YOU RECKON HARVEY DON'T COME
 IT HAD ALL THE MARKS OF A SUNDAY-SCHOOL
 AND WHAT FOR
 BY AND BY JIM SAYS
 ORGIES IS BETTER BECAUSE IT MEANS THE THING YOU'RE AFTER MORE EXACT
 AND SHE HAIN'T SWEATED A HAIRNOT A HAIR
I SHOT THIS FELLOW AND TOOK HIM INTO CAMP
SO HE TOOK HIM TO HIS OWN HOUSE AND DRESSED HIM UP CLEAN AND NICE AND HAD HIM TO BREAKFAST AND DINNER AND SUPPER WITH THE FAMILY AND WAS JUST OLD PIE TO HIM SO TO SPEAK
 CUT LOOSE AND LET HER SLIDE SO IN TWO SECONDS AWAY WE WENT A-SLIDING DOWN THE RIVER AND IT DID SEEM SO GOOD TO BE FREE AGAIN AND ALL BY OURSELVES ON THE BIG RIVER AND NOBODY TO BOTHER US
SO WE STAYED WHERE WE WAS
BUT IT WARN'T NO USEUP THE STREET HE WOULD TEAR AGAIN AND GIVE SHERBURN ANOTHER CUSSING
WELL BEFORE LONG HERE COMES THE WRECK DIM AND DUSKY SLIDING ALONG DOWN
 WHY HUCK S'POSE IT IS CONSIDERBLE TROUBLE?WHAT YOU GOING TO DO?HOW YOU GOING TO GET AROUND IT
 IT MOST KILLED JIM A-LAUGHING
SO CLEAR OUT HE SAYS
 BUT PER'APS IF WE KEEP THEM TILL THEY'RE RANSOMED IT MEANS THAT WE KEEP THEM TILL THEY'RE DEAD NOW THAT'S SOMETHING LIKE
 THEY MIGHT SUSPICION SOMETHING IF ALL OF YOU WAS TO GO
 THEN HE SAID HE MUST START IN AND TERPRET IT BECAUSE IT WAS SENT FOR A WARNING
BUT ALL AT ONCE I THOUGHT OF A WAY AND SO I OFFERED THEM MISS WATSONTHEY COULD KILL HER
THE SHADINGS HAVE NOT BEEN DONE IN A HAPHAZARD FASHION OR BY GUESSWORK
 SHE SHOWED ME A BAR OF LEAD TWISTED UP INTO A KNOT AND SAID SHE WAS A GOOD SHOT WITH IT GENERLY BUT SHE'D WRENCHED HER ARM A DAY OR TWO AGO AND DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER SHE COULD THROW TRUE NOW
THE WIGWAM WOULD KEEP IT FROM BEING SEEN
IT'S AS GOOD AS I DESERVE
 I OWNS MYSEF EN I'S WUTH EIGHT HUND'D DOLLARS
I'LL FIND IT OUT OR BUST
AND I'D A GOT UP AND OBEYED HER IF I'D A BEEN DEAD
 HE'S SICKAND SO IS MAM AND MARY ANN OH THE DEVIL
BUT I RECKON IT WAS MORE THAN A CAT-NAP FOR WHEN I WAKED UP THE STARS WAS SHINING BRIGHT THE FOG WAS ALL GONE AND I WAS SPINNING DOWN A BIG BEND STERN FIRST
THEN AWAY OUT IN THE WOODS I HEARD THAT KIND OF A SOUND THAT A GHOST MAKES WHEN IT WANTS TO TELL ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S ON ITS MIND AND CAN'T MAKE ITSELF UNDERSTOOD AND SO CAN'T REST EASY IN ITS GRAVE AND HAS TO GO ABOUT THAT WAY EVERY NIGHT GRIEVING
 THE LOT OF TOWHEADS WAS TROUBLES WE WAS GOING TO GET INTO WITH QUARRELSOME PEOPLE AND ALL KINDS OF MEAN FOLKS BUT IF WE MINDED OUR BUSINESS AND DIDN'T TALK BACK AND AGGRAVATE THEM WE WOULD PULL THROUGH AND GET OUT OF THE FOG AND INTO THE BIG CLEAR RIVER WHICH WAS THE FREE STATES AND WOULDN'T HAVE NO MORE TROUBLE
TOM I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU BEEN DOING DOWN THERE I HAIN'T BEEN DOING A SINGLE THING AUNT SALLY I HOPE TO GRACIOUS IF I HAVE I RECKONED SHE'D LET ME GO NOW AND AS A GENERL THING SHE WOULD
 WELL YOU ANSWER ME DIS
 THAT'S JUST THE WAY
 LE'S GO AND DO IT HOLD ON A MINUTE
 THE LIGHTNING SHOWED US THE WRECK AGAIN JUST IN TIME AND WE FETCHED THE STABBOARD DERRICK AND MADE FAST THERE
 AND HE WOULD DO IT JUST AS INDIFFERENT AS IF HE WAS ORDERING UP EGGS
AMEN COME PORE AND NEEDY SUNK IN SHAME
BUT HE LAUGHED SUCH A SCREECHY LAUGH AND ROARED AND CUSSED AND KEPT ON CHASING ME UP
WHAT DO WE WANT OF A MOAT WHEN WE'RE GOING TO SNAKE HIM OUT FROM UNDER THE CABIN BUT HE NEVER HEARD ME
AND FOUR MODIFIED VARIETIES OF THIS LAST
 WHY SHE TRIED TO LEARN YOU YOUR BOOK SHE TRIED TO LEARN YOU YOUR MANNERS SHE TRIED TO BE GOOD TO YOU EVERY WAY SHE KNOWED HOW
 AND YOU WANT TO WATER IT WITH YOUR TEARS WHY I GOT PLENTY SPRING WATER MARS TOM YOU DON'T WANT SPRING WATER
I AIN'T HEARD NOBODY SAY NOTHING THEN HE TURNS TO JIM AND LOOKS HIM OVER LIKE HE NEVER SEE HIM BEFORE AND SAYS
 IT WAS AS LONG AS THE HUT BUT NARROWONLY ABOUT SIX FOOT WIDE

 HE HAD SOME ER DE DAD-FETCHEDES WAYS I EVER SEE

 IF WE COULD PUT IT OFF TILL HURRY

WELL I CATCHED MY BREATH AND MOST FAINTED
A VERY NICE KIND-LOOKING OLD MAN WHEN I GOT HIM UP
WELL THE WOMAN FELL TO TALKING ABOUT HOW HARD TIMES WAS AND HOW POOR THEY HAD TO LIVE AND HOW THE RATS WAS AS FREE AS IF THEY OWNED THE PLACE AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND THEN I GOT EASY AGAIN
 THERE WAS AN OLD HORSE-BLANKET NAILED AGAINST THE LOGS AT THE FAR END OF THE CABIN BEHIND THE TABLE TO KEEP THE WIND FROM BLOWING THROUGH THE CHINKS AND PUTTING THE CANDLE OUT
BEN ROGERS SAID HE COULDN'T GET OUT MUCH ONLY SUNDAYS AND SO HE WANTED TO BEGIN NEXT SUNDAY

 WELL I'VE NOTICED THAT THING PLENTY TIMES SINCE
 BY AND BY I GOT THE OLD SPLIT-BOTTOM CHAIR AND CLUMB UP AS EASY AS I COULD NOT TO MAKE ANY NOISE AND GOT DOWN THE GUN

 THE STRAPS WAS BROKE OFF OF IT BUT BARRING THAT IT WAS A GOOD ENOUGH LEG THOUGH IT WAS TOO LONG FOR ME AND NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR JIM AND WE COULDN'T FIND THE OTHER ONE THOUGH WE HUNTED ALL AROUND
 HE SAID LET HIM ALONE A MINUTE AND DON'T DISTURB HIM
SO THE BIRDS WAS RIGHT ABOUT IT
 SHE HAD FIVE BIG WIGWAMS ABOARD WIDE APART AND AN OPEN CAMP FIRE IN THE MIDDLE AND A TALL FLAG-POLE AT EACH END
 I COULDN'T HARDLY GET MY WORDS OUT I WAS SO ANXIOUS
 NO SAH I DOAN WANT NO SICH DOIN'S BLAME IT CAN'T YOU TRY
BUT IT WOULDN'T MADE MUCH DIFFERENCE ANYWAY BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME THEY COULDN'T A TREED ME BECAUSE I DIDN'T BREATHE
BUT AT LAST HE ALLOWED HE WOULD LET HIM SCRABBLE THEM ALL ON
HE'S ONE ER DEM CHUCKLEHEADS YOU KNOW
 DEN WE KIN GIT SUMFN BETTER DEN STRAWBRIES STRAWBERRIES AND SUCH TRUCK I SAYS
 I WENT UP-STREAM FAR ENOUGH TO MAKE THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND AND THEN STARTED ACROSS

 _WHAT DID HE SING OUT AND TURNS TO ME PERFECTLY CA'M AND SAYS DID YOU HEAR ANYBODY SING OUT OF COURSE THERE WARN'T NOTHING TO BE SAID BUT THE ONE THING

 PUT UP THAT PISTOL BILL BILL SAYS
THEY TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE ONE O'CLOCK IN ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND SO HE MUST GO HOMEHE MUST GO RIGHT AWAY
AND DOWN BY THE VILLAGE WAS THE RIVER A WHOLE MILE BROAD AND AWFUL STILL AND GRAND
 I SAYS I'LL NEVER VOTE AGIN
BUT GO AHEAD I AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO SAY LITTLE TOMMY BARNES WAS ASLEEP NOW AND WHEN THEY WAKED HIM UP HE WAS SCARED AND CRIED AND SAID HE WANTED TO GO HOME TO HIS MA AND DIDN'T WANT TO BE A ROBBER ANY MORE
I FOLLOWED THE MEN TO SEE WHAT THEY WAS GOING TO DO WITH JIM
 AND TOLD HIM HOW TO KEEP A JOURNAL ON THE SHIRT WITH HIS BLOOD AND ALL THAT
OUR HOLE WAS PRETTY BIG BUT IT WARN'T BIG ENOUGH TO GET THE GRINDSTONE THROUGH
 AND THERE WAS THE FERRYBOAT FULL OF PEOPLE FLOATING ALONG DOWN
AND IT SATISFIED HIM
 BUT TOM SAYS
 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOUIF YOU GOT ANY REASONABLENESS IN YOU AT ALLWHAT KIND OF A SHOW WOULD THAT GIVE HIM TO BE A HERO
I KNOWED HE WOULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN THIS KIND OF BUSINESS AND THROW IN THE FANCY TOUCHES
 I HAVEN'T LIVED HERE QUITE TWO WEEKS
THEY GOT HIM OUT AND EMPTIED HIM
 HE SAID THAT IN THAT WAY IT COULD BE STRUNG OUT TO AS MUCH AS EIGHTY YEAR AND WOULD BE THE BEST TIME ON RECORD
 HE COME IN A CANOE ALONG WITH TIM COLLINS AND A BOY THE DOCTOR HE UP AND SAYS
BUT IT WARN'T NO USE CONSCIENCE UP AND SAYS EVERY TIME BUT YOU KNOWED HE WAS RUNNING FOR HIS FREEDOM AND YOU COULD A PADDLED ASHORE AND TOLD SOMEBODY  THAT WAS SOI COULDN'T GET AROUND THAT NOWAY
BUT I RECKON THAT WAS SORT OF PILING IT ON MAYBE

 RIGHT THEN ALONG COMES A SKIFF WITH TWO MEN IN IT WITH GUNS AND THEY STOPPED AND I STOPPED
AND THEN HE STOOD UP STRAIGHT AND STIFF WHERE SHERBURN HAD STOOD FROWNING AND HAVING HIS HAT-BRIM DOWN OVER HIS EYES AND SUNG OUT BOGGS AND THEN FETCHED HIS CANE DOWN SLOW TO A LEVEL AND SAYS BANG STAGGERED BACKWARDS SAYS BANG AGAIN AND FELL DOWN FLAT ON HIS BACK

 I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL MUCH BEFORE BUT I RECKONED I'D GO NOW TO SPITE PAP
 DOG MY CATS EF I DIDN HEAR SUMF'N
 I SET UP AND LOOKED AROUND A LITTLE SCARED
 I UZ HUNGRY BUT I WARN'T AFEARD

 IF ANYBODY CAN PERSUADE HIM SHE CAN SO SOMEBODY STARTED ON A RUN
 IT'S A LONG DUSTY THREE MILE AND WE CAN'T LET YOU WALK
 WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW WAS WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO AND WAS HE GOING TO STAY
 BUT PRETTY SOON HE STRUGGLED UP ASTRADDLE AND GRABBED THE BRIDLE A-REELING THIS WAY AND THAT
THEN MARY JANE SHE TOOK ANOTHER INNING AND WENT IN SWEET AND LOVELY AGAINWHICH WAS HER WAY
 HADN'T WHEN I COME AWAY ANYHOW JIM SAYS KIND OF SOLEMN
 GIVE A BODY A REST
HIM AND HIS RAFT WAS JUST A SPECK ON THE WATER AWAY OFF YONDER
SAID HE COULD RIDE AS WELL AS ANYBODY THAT EVER WAS
EN HEAH SHE IS
 WHEN I COME IN SIGHT OF THE LOG STORE AND THE WOODPILE WHERE THE STEAMBOATS LANDS I WORKED ALONG UNDER THE TREES AND BRUSH TILL I GOT TO A GOOD PLACE AND THEN I CLUMB UP INTO THE FORKS OF A COTTONWOOD THAT WAS OUT OF REACH AND WATCHED
 IT WOULD GET SO DARK THAT IT LOOKED ALL BLUE-BLACK OUTSIDE AND LOVELY
 WELL I SH'D RECKON YOU WON'T NO'M I'M HONEST ABOUT IT
THEY WERE GOING TO PAY IN CORDWOOD AND ONIONS AS USUAL BUT HE SAID HE HAD JUST BOUGHT THE CONCERN AND KNOCKED DOWN THE PRICE AS LOW AS HE COULD AFFORD IT AND WAS GOING TO RUN IT FOR CASH
IT WAS A DOUBLE HOUSE AND THE BIG OPEN PLACE BETWIXT THEM WAS ROOFED AND FLOORED AND SOMETIMES THE TABLE WAS SET THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND IT WAS A COOL COMFORTABLE PLACE
SHE WAS A STRANGER FOR YOU COULDN'T START A FACE IN THAT TOWN THAT I DIDN'T KNOW
BUT SOFT YOU THE FAIR OPHELIA
I TAKE EN WHACK DE BILL IN TWO EN GIVE HALF UN IT TO YOU EN DE YUTHER HALF TO DE YUTHER WOMAN

 HE'S GOT THE BRAIN-FEVER AS SHORE AS YOU'RE BORN AND THEY'RE OOZING OUT AND EVERYBODY RUNS TO SEE AND SHE SNATCHES OFF MY HAT AND OUT COMES THE BREAD AND WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE BUTTER AND SHE GRABBED ME AND HUGGED ME AND SAYS
WHY THERE AIN'T NO END TO YOUR AIRSTHEY SAY YOU'RE RICH
BUT THAT WAS A LIE
 DOWN BY THE WOOD-PILE I COMES ACROSS MY JACK AND SAYS
 IF YOU WAS IN HIS PLACE IT WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL ASHAMED
 IT WOULDN'T A DONE NO GOOD
 IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO HEAR THAT CLOCK TICK
AND I WAS KINDER STUNNED
 THEN WE LIT THE CANDLES AND CRAWLED IN ON OUR HANDS AND KNEES
SLEEPING IN THE WOODS.RAISING THE DEAD.EXPLORING THE ISLAND.FINDING JIM.JIM'S ESCAPE.SIGNS.BALUM
 HE HADN'T ON ANYTHING BUT A SHIRT AND HE WAS VERY FROWZY-HEADED
 WE WENT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS AND THEN THE CAVE OPENED UP
THERE WAS FOUR OR FIVE MEN CAVORTING AROUND ON THEIR HORSES IN THE OPEN PLACE BEFORE THE LOG STORE CUSSING AND YELLING AND TRYING TO GET AT A COUPLE OF YOUNG CHAPS THAT WAS BEHIND THE WOOD-RANK ALONGSIDE OF THE STEAMBOAT LANDING
THE DOCTOR HE STARTED TO SAY SOMETHING AND TURNS AND SAYS

 YOU BET HE WOULDN'T
LOOK AT THAT NOW
 AND THEY DIDN'T ACT ANYWAY MUCH AS FUR AS I SEE
JIM LOOKED AT THE TRASH AND THEN LOOKED AT ME AND BACK AT THE TRASH AGAIN
 WE WAS IN THE PATH TO THE MILL
 BUT I COULDN'T MAKE OUT HOW HE WAS WILLING TO GO INTO THIS THING
 WHEN I GOT A LITTLE WAYS I HEARD THE DIM HUM OF A SPINNING-WHEEL WAILING ALONG UP AND SINKING ALONG DOWN AGAIN
 WELL NEXT I TOOK AN OLD SACK AND PUT A LOT OF BIG ROCKS IN ITALL I COULD DRAGAND I STARTED IT FROM THE PIG AND DRAGGED IT TO THE DOOR AND THROUGH THE WOODS DOWN TO THE RIVER AND DUMPED IT IN AND DOWN IT SUNK OUT OF SIGHT

 BY THAT TIME EVERYTHING WE HAD IN THE WORLD WAS ON OUR RAFT AND SHE WAS READY TO BE SHOVED OUT FROM THE WILLOW COVE WHERE SHE WAS HID
BUT SHE CHIPPED IN AND SAYS
AND SAID HE WAS JUST LOADENED DOWN WITH MORE GAUDIER CHANCES THAN A PRISONER EVER HAD IN THE WORLD TO MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF AND YET HE DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THEM AND THEY WAS JUST ABOUT WASTED ON HIM
EVERYBODY SAID IT WAS A REAL BEAUTIFUL OATH AND ASKED TOM IF HE GOT IT OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD
 IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AUNT SALLY COMES GLIDING IN AND THERE I WAS UP A STUMP AGAIN
GEORGE WAS THE MARRIED BROTHER
 JIM WAS MOST RUINED FOR A SERVANT BECAUSE HE GOT STUCK UP ON ACCOUNT OF HAVING SEEN THE DEVIL AND BEEN RODE BY WITCHES
 HE GIVE ME DOWN THE BANKS FOR NOT COMING AND TELLING HIM I SEE THE NIGGERS COME OUT OF HIS ROOM ACTING THAT WAYSAID ANY FOOL WOULD A KNOWED SOMETHING WAS UP
 AND HE SAID THAT HANDLING A SNAKE-SKIN WAS SUCH AWFUL BAD LUCK THAT MAYBE WE HADN'T GOT TO THE END OF IT YET
DON'T YOU RECKON I KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT
YES HE'S GOT A FATHER BUT YOU CAN'T NEVER FIND HIM THESE DAYS
IT'S JUST AS I EXPECTED
THE COAT OF ARMS.A SKILLED SUPERINTENDENT.UNPLEASANT GLORY.A TEARFUL SUBJECT
 HE TOLD YOU JUST EXACTLY WRONG WELL HE DID ACT LIKE HE WAS DRUNK BUT IT AIN'T NO MATTER NOW
SO HE TOOK ME IN THE TEXAS TO THE OFFICERS LUNCH AND GIVE ME ALL I WANTED I WAS GETTING SO UNEASY I COULDN'T LISTEN GOOD
 AND WENT ON THINKING
 MARS BUCK HE LOADED UP HIS GUN EN LOWED HE'S GWYNE TO FETCH HOME A SHEPHERDSON OR BUST
 THAT WAS ALL THEY ASKED ME
ONE'S ENOUGH TO BE LOST AT A TIME
BUT IT WARN'T NO USE NONE OF THE GENIES COME
I'D LIKE TO
 DE FAMBLY FOUN IT OUT BOUT HALF AN HOUR AGOMAYBE A LITTLE MO'EN I TELL YOU DEY WARN'T NO TIME LOS  SICH ANOTHER HURRYIN UP GUNS EN HOSSES YOU NEVER SEE
 WE GOT TO HAVE A ROCK FOR THE COAT OF ARMS AND MOURNFUL INSCRIPTIONS AND WE CAN KILL TWO BIRDS WITH THAT SAME ROCK
 THE THING FOR US TO DO IS JUST TO DO OUR DUTY AND NOT WORRY ABOUT WHETHER ANYBODY SEES US DO IT OR NOT
CHAPTER I
 THE TOWHEAD WAS A RATTLING BIG DISTANCE OFF AWAY OUT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER BUT I DIDN'T LOSE NO TIME
 JUMP OUT AND HE'P THE GENTLEMAN ADOLPHUS"MEANING ME I SEE
HE'LL BE BACK ANY MINUTE NOW
 BUT BY AND BY THE KING TRIPPED AND FELL OVERBOARD AND AFTER THAT THEY TOOK A REST AND HAD A TALK ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ADVENTURES THEY'D HAD IN OTHER TIMES ALONG THE RIVER
 THEY'LL GO OVER AFTER MIDNIGHT COULDN'T THEY SEE BETTER IF THEY WAS TO WAIT TILL DAYTIME YES
 I DIDN'T SEE NO DI'MONDS AND I TOLD TOM SAWYER SO
 IN A QUARTER OF A MINUTE I WAS A KIND OF A HUB OF A WHEEL AS YOU MAY SAYSPOKES MADE OUT OF DOGSCIRCLE OF FIFTEEN OF THEM PACKED TOGETHER AROUND ME WITH THEIR NECKS AND NOSES STRETCHED UP TOWARDS ME A-BARKING AND HOWLING
I PASSED ALONG AND THE PARLOR DOOR WAS OPEN
 THE RIDGE OUR CAVERN WAS IN WAS FULL OF THEM
 I MADE A SAFE LANDING AND CLUMB UP THE BANK
 SO THEN THE LAWYER TURNS TO THE NEW OLD GENTLEMAN AND SAYS
 I LOOKED ALL AROUND
 I TOOK OFF THE SUN-BONNET FOR I DIDN'T WANT NO BLINDERS ON THEN
AND MY HEART SWELLED UP SUDDEN LIKE TO BUST
 A VOICE NOT TWENTY-FIVE FOOT FROM ME SAYS
WHY ANY CANDLE HE SAYS
 HASN'T HE GOT AWAY HIM SAYS AUNT SALLY
AND I HUNG AROUND THE NIGGER CABINS AND LAID FOR A CHANCE AND STOLE THREE TIN PLATES
 WHY AFTER EVERY LAST SNAKE HAD BEEN GONE CLEAR OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR AS MUCH AS A WEEK AUNT SALLY WARN'T OVER IT YET
 THE PREACHERS HAD HIGH PLATFORMS TO STAND ON AT ONE END OF THE SHEDS
 WHERE'D YOU COME FROM  THEN HE SAYS KIND OF GLAD AND EAGER WHERE'S THE RAFT?GOT HER IN A GOOD PLACE I SAYS
LOOK AT THEM CASE-KNIFE SAWS AND THINGS HOW TEDIOUS THEY'VE BEEN MADE
WELL AFTER A LONG TIME I HEARD THE CLOCK AWAY OFF IN THE TOWN GO BOOMBOOMBOOMTWELVE LICKS
WHY BUCK THEY MIGHT HAVE SCALPED US ALL YOU'VE BEEN SO SLOW IN COMING WELL NOBODY COME AFTER ME AND IT AIN'T RIGHT I'M ALWAYS KEPT DOWN
 IT'S THE BEST WAY IN THE LONG RUN
 DO THEY TREAT EM BETTER N WE TREAT OUR NIGGERS NO
 JIM'S GOT TO DO HIS INSCRIPTION AND COAT OF ARMS
I MOST FORGOT IT
 IT WAS A PICTURE OF A YOUNG WOMAN IN A LONG WHITE GOWN STANDING ON THE RAIL OF A BRIDGE ALL READY TO JUMP OFF WITH HER HAIR ALL DOWN HER BACK AND LOOKING UP TO THE MOON WITH THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN HER FACE AND SHE HAD TWO ARMS FOLDED ACROSS HER BREAST AND TWO ARMS STRETCHED OUT IN FRONT AND TWO MORE REACHING UP TOWARDS THE MOONAND THE IDEA WAS TO SEE WHICH PAIR WOULD LOOK BEST AND THEN SCRATCH OUT ALL THE OTHER ARMS
A GOOD GOING-OVER.GRACE TRIUMPHANT."ONE OF TOM SAWYERS'S LIES CHAPTER IV
 IF HE AIN'T HERE TO SUPPER YOUR UNCLE LL GO WELL HE WARN'T THERE TO SUPPER
SOMETIMES DO WHAT WE COULD WE COULDN'T KEEP HER FROM FALLING OVER AND SHE COME MIGHTY NEAR MASHING US EVERY TIME
THEY CRIED AROUND EACH OTHER AND TOOK ON SO IT MOST MADE ME DOWN SICK TO SEE IT
 THEY SAID HE WAS FLOATING ON HIS BACK IN THE WATER
 IF THEY'D A HAD SOME BULLETS IN I RECKON THEY'D A GOT THE CORPSE THEY WAS AFTER
SHE DESPISED SNAKES BE THE BREED WHAT THEY MIGHT AND SHE COULDN'T STAND THEM NO WAY YOU COULD FIX IT
 SHE DISTURBED THE OLD MAN SO THAT HE SAID HE COULD MOST WISH THERE HADN'T EVER BEEN NO SNAKES CREATED
I WENT UP AND SET DOWN ON A LOG AT THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND AND LOOKED OUT ON THE BIG RIVER AND THE BLACK DRIFTWOOD AND AWAY OVER TO THE TOWN THREE MILE AWAY WHERE THERE WAS THREE OR FOUR LIGHTS TWINKLING
 SO I NEVER STOPPED RUNNING TILL I FOUND THE CANOE
I TOOK THE AXE AND SMASHED IN THE DOOR
 IT MUST TAKE EM A WEEK SHUCKS THEY DON'T ALL OF EM PREACH THE SAME DAYONLY ONE OF EM WELL THEN WHAT DOES THE REST OF EM DO OH NOTHING MUCH
1
BUT IN A LITTLE WHILE I SEE A PALE STREAK OVER THE TREETOPS AND KNOWED THE DAY WAS COMING
AND IF THEY GOT ME THEY'D TAR AND FEATHER ME AND RIDE ME ON A RAIL SURE
YES SAYS THE DUKE KINDER SLOW AND DELIBERATE AND SARCASTIC WE DID AFTER ABOUT A HALF A MINUTE THE KING DRAWLS OUT
HONEY I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS SARAH WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN OH YES'M I DID
BUT WHEN SHE WAS SHE HAD A LOOK THAT WOULD MAKE YOU WILT IN YOUR TRACKS LIKE HER FATHER
 JIM TOLD ME TO CHOP OFF THE SNAKE'S HEAD AND THROW IT AWAY AND THEN SKIN THE BODY AND ROAST A PIECE OF IT
 HE HAD HIS GUN ACROSS HIS POMMEL
 DON'T ANYBODY LIVE THERE
 BUT THEY'LL GET THE NIGGER PRETTY SOON NOW AND MAYBE THEY CAN SCARE IT OUT OF HIM WHY ARE THEY AFTER HIM YET WELL YOU'RE INNOCENT AIN'T YOU
 I SAYS TO SISTER DAMRELLDIDN'T I SISTER DAMRELL?S'I HE'S CRAZY S'ITHEM'S THE VERY WORDS I SAID
 BUT WE GOT THEM LAID IN AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS
AND A BOTHERSOME LOT THEY'LL BE TOOEATING UP EVERYTHING AND ALWAYS TRYING TO GET LOOSE HOW YOU TALK BEN ROGERS
 AND I WROTE ANOTHER ONE TO TELL YOU I WAS COMING
 BUT THE DUKE KIND OF SOURED ON HIM AND DIDN'T LOOK A BIT SATISFIED WITH THE WAY THINGS WAS GOING
BUT ANYBODY COULD BUY PRIVATE BEFOREHAND IF THEY WANTED TO
AND LAWS-A-ME I'VE BEEN HUNGRY FOR IT A MANY AND A MANY A TIME ALL THESE LONG YEARS AND IT'S COME AT LAST
 A CINCINNATI BOAT WILL BUT THIS IS A ST LOUIS ONE WAS PETER WILKS WELL OFF OH YES PRETTY WELL OFF
WELL I WUZ DAH ALL NIGHT
I HAIN'T GOT BUT ONE CHAW LEFT
SHAKE ITDON'T BE AFEARD SO THEY SHOOK IT ONE AFTER THE OTHER ALL AROUND AND CRIED
HE RUN OFF F'M DOWN SOUTH SOM'ERS IT'S A GOOD JOB THEY GOT HIM WELL I RECKON
BUT I SAYS THIS AIN'T NO TIME TO BE FOOLING AROUND
 SO PAP SAID SOMEBODY GOT TO GET ASHORE AND GET HELP SOMEHOW
ALL RIGHT SAYS I GO AHEAD G-E-O-R-G-E J-A-X-O-NTHERE NOW HE SAYS
 IT WAS OUTRAGEOUS AND I KNOWED I OUGHT TO JUST UP AND TELL HIM SO
 JUST LISTEN AT THE MAN
 AND EVERYBODY CROWDED UP WITH THE TEARS IN THEIR EYES AND MOST SHOOK THE HANDS OFF OF THEM FRAUDS SAYING ALL THE TIME
 I GOT THE THING AND THE FIRST RAT THAT SHOWED HIS NOSE I LET DRIVE AND IF HE'D A STAYED WHERE HE WAS HE'D A BEEN A TOLERABLE SICK RAT
 HERE IS THE WAY WE PUT IN THE TIME
BUT IT WARN'T NOTHING BUT THE FLUTTER OF A STEAMBOAT'S WHEEL AWAY DOWN COMING AROUND THE POINT
CREST A RUNAWAY NIGGER SABLE WITH HIS BUNDLE OVER HIS SHOULDER ON A BAR SINISTER
 WHY I WOULDN'T TAKE A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THAT HORSE NOWI WOULDN'T HONEST
 I WISHED THE WIDOW KNOWED ABOUT IT
 SO WHEN IT WAS GOOD AND DARK I SLID OUT FROM SHORE BEFORE MOONRISE AND PADDLED OVER TO THE ILLINOIS BANKABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE
TURN THIS PITIFUL RASCAL OUTI BEG YOU TO DO IT
WE'RE IN A HURRY BOY
 I COULDN'T ANSWER THAT
 BUT NOT FEELING BRASH
WHEN HE GOT OUT THE NEW JUDGE SAID HE WAS A-GOING TO MAKE A MAN OF HIM
STILL AND SUNDAYLIKE.MISTAKEN IDENTITY.UP A STUMP.IN A DILEMMA
 I NEVER SEE ANYTHING SO DISGUSTING
 IT SWORE EVERY BOY TO STICK TO THE BAND AND NEVER TELL ANY OF THE SECRETS
 PRETTY SOON HE GAPPED AND STRETCHED HIMSELF AND HOVE OFF THE BLANKET AND IT WAS MISS WATSON'S JIM
 WE CAN'T HELP THE WAY A KING SMELLS
 SO THAT COOLED THEM DOWN A LITTLE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT'S ALWAYS THE MOST ANXIOUS FOR TO HANG A NIGGER THAT HAIN'T DONE JUST RIGHT IS ALWAYS THE VERY ONES THAT AIN'T THE MOST ANXIOUS TO PAY FOR HIM WHEN THEY'VE GOT THEIR SATISFACTION OUT OF HIM
 IT WAS AS BIG A FISH AS WAS EVER CATCHED IN THE MISSISSIPPI I RECKON
 THIS IS THE SPEECHI LEARNED IT EASY ENOUGH WHILE HE WAS LEARNING IT TO THE KING
 IT SAID
 AND BY AND BY THEY HAD ME UP TO TELL WHAT I KNOWED
DON'T FOOL AROUND HERE AND THE EVASION BOOMING ALONG SO HANDSOME
 "EF YOU'S GOT HAIRY ARMS EN A HAIRY BREAS IT'S A SIGN DAT YOU'S AGWYNE TO BE RICH
WE STOPPED TALKING AND GOT TO THINKING
 PETER AND GEORGE WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT COME OUT HERE
AND THEN GRIPPED ME BY BOTH HANDS AND SHOOK AND SHOOK
WELL I DON'T CARE IF I DID I DIDN'T DO IT ANYWAY
 I SAID I WOULDN'T AND I'LL STICK TO IT
AND BEHIND HER COMES HER LITTLE WHITE CHILDREN ACTING THE SAME WAY THE LITTLE NIGGERS WAS DOING
 THEY ALL SMOKED AND TALKED AND I EAT AND TALKED
 IF THEY HAVE WON'T THE COMPLICES GET AWAY WITH THAT BAG OF GOLD PETER WILKS LEFT
TOM DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME HE WAS ALL RIGHT
 SO THEN SHE KISSED ME AND PATTED ME ON THE HEAD AND DROPPED INTO A KIND OF A BROWN STUDY
 SHE RUN ON AND NEVER NOTICED I HAD PUT IN AT ALL
 HE WAS VERY SORRY HE WAS SO PUSHED AND SO WAS EVERYBODY
AND AFTER THAT ALL THROUGH HIS SPEECH HE HOWLED AND SPREAD AROUND AND SWELLED UP HIS CHEST AND JUST KNOCKED THE SPOTS OUT OF ANY ACTING EVER I SEE BEFORE
AND SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO TO BED BUT SHE DASN'T SET UP
 IT FELL PRETTY SOLID AND ONLY ROLLED ABOUT AN INCH
 WE WARN'T FEELING JUST RIGHT BEFORE THAT BUT IT WAS ALL COMFORTABLE NOW
 I AIN'T A-GOING TO TELL AND I AIN'T A-GOING BACK THERE ANYWAYS
AND THEN MY EAR BEGUN TO ITCH
 THEY KNOWED US AND DIDN'T MAKE NO MORE NOISE THAN COUNTRY DOGS IS ALWAYS DOING WHEN ANYTHING COMES BY IN THE NIGHT
AND I DONE IT
 WHY I WOULDN'T SET OUT SUCH A STRING AS THAT NOT IF I NEVER GOT TO GLORY
 THE YOUNG WOMEN HAD QUILTS AROUND THEM AND THEIR HAIR DOWN THEIR BACKS
 I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THE MONEY WAS IN THERE OR NOT
IT AIN'T NO USE TALKIN
 THEN THEY STOOD THERE WITH THEIR HANDS ON THE LEDGE OF THE BERTH AND TALKED
 I'LL STUFF JIM'S CLOTHES FULL OF STRAW AND LAY IT ON HIS BED TO REPRESENT HIS MOTHER IN DISGUISE AND JIM LL TAKE THE NIGGER WOMAN'S GOWN OFF OF ME AND WEAR IT AND WE'LL ALL EVADE TOGETHER
I JUST EXPECTED IT
 I ROUSES UP AND RESTS ON MY ELBOW AND LISTENS
 WELL HE HAIN'T COME BACK SENCE AND THEY AIN'T LOOKING FOR HIM BACK TILL THIS THING BLOWS OVER A LITTLE FOR PEOPLE THINKS NOW THAT HE KILLED HIS BOY AND FIXED THINGS SO FOLKS WOULD THINK ROBBERS DONE IT AND THEN HE'D GET HUCK'S MONEY WITHOUT HAVING TO BOTHER A LONG TIME WITH A LAWSUIT
 WHAT'S DE USE ER DAT HALF A BILL?CAN'T BUY NOTH'N WID IT
 THE RACKET STOPPED AND THE WAVE SUCKED BACK
 LE'S GET BREAKFAST
 QUITE A FORTUNE FOR YOU
THEN THE NIGGER COME BACK AND WE SAID WE'D COME AGAIN SOME TIME IF THE NIGGER WANTED US TO
 THERE WAS A SEEDY OLD CHEST AND AN OLD HAIR TRUNK WITH THE HINGES BROKE
 WE WOULD SELL THE RAFT AND GET ON A STEAMBOAT AND GO WAY UP THE OHIO AMONGST THE FREE STATES AND THEN BE OUT OF TROUBLE
BUT TAKE IT ALL AROUND I WAS FEELING RUTHER COMFORTABLE ON ACCOUNTS OF TAKING ALL THIS TROUBLE FOR THAT GANG FOR NOT MANY WOULD A DONE IT
 SO THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO COME BACK AND HA'NT ME FOR I SAYS
I HAD THE ROAD ALL TO MYSELF AND I FAIRLY FLEWLEASTWAYS I HAD IT ALL TO MYSELF EXCEPT THE SOLID DARK AND THE NOW-AND-THEN GLARES AND THE BUZZING OF THE RAIN AND THE THRASHING OF THE WIND AND THE SPLITTING OF THE THUNDER
AND I NEVER SEE A NIGGER THAT WAS A BETTER NUSS OR FAITHFULLER AND YET HE WAS RISKING HIS FREEDOM TO DO IT AND WAS ALL TIRED OUT TOO AND I SEE PLAIN ENOUGH HE'D BEEN WORKED MAIN HARD LATELY
BUT THAT BIG HUSKY HAD ME BY THE WRISTHINESAND A BODY MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO GIVE GOLIAR THE SLIP
OH YOU NEEDN'T BE AFEARD SIR SHE CARRIED THE THREE OF US EASY ENOUGH WHAT THREE WHY ME AND SID ANDANDAND THE GUNS
 THEN THE DOCTOR WHIRLS ON ME AND SAYS
 THEN I SAYS
 THEN I SAYS
 THEN I SAYS
 THEN I SAYS
 THEN I SAYS
 A BODY D THINK YOU WOULD LEARN TO TAKE SOME SORT OF CARE OF EM AT YOUR TIME OF LIFE I KNOW IT SALLY AND I DO TRY ALL I CAN
 THEN WE GOT ALLYCUMPAIN AND RUBBED ON THE PLACES AND WAS PRETTY NEAR ALL RIGHT AGAIN BUT COULDN'T SET DOWN CONVENIENT
THIS WAS INCLUDING MISS WATSON AS I TOOK IT
THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO WATCH BUT THE TEXAS AND THE PILOT-HOUSE
AND ANOTHER ONE WAS A BIG ROUGH HUSKY THAT COME ALONG AND LISTENED TO ALL THE OLD GENTLEMAN SAID AND WAS LISTENING TO THE KING NOW
 COME IN AS SOON AS I WAS IN THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE LOCKED THE DOOR AND BARRED IT AND BOLTED IT AND TOLD THE YOUNG MEN TO COME IN WITH THEIR GUNS AND THEY ALL WENT IN A BIG PARLOR THAT HAD A NEW RAG CARPET ON THE FLOOR AND GOT TOGETHER IN A CORNER THAT WAS OUT OF THE RANGE OF THE FRONT WINDOWSTHERE WARN'T NONE ON THE SIDE
 "WHERE'S JIM RIGHT AT YOUR ELBOW
THIS WAS TO BUILD A FIRE ON IN SLOPPY WEATHER OR CHILLY
IF A BODY'S OUT HUNTING FOR COWARDS HE DON'T WANT TO FOOL AWAY ANY TIME AMONGST THEM SHEPHERDSONS BECUZ THEY DON'T BREED ANY OF THAT KIND NEXT SUNDAY WE ALL WENT TO CHURCH ABOUT THREE MILE EVERYBODY A-HORSEBACK
 HE ALWAYS DONE THE OTHER THING
 LOOK AT HENRY THE EIGHT
YOU DIDN KNOW
AND NEXT HE WENT A-CHARGING UP ON TO THE PLATFORM AND THE PREACHER HE BEGGED HIM TO SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE AND HE DONE IT
 THEN THEY RAKED IT INTO THE BAG AGAIN AND I SEE THE KING BEGIN TO SWELL HIMSELF UP FOR ANOTHER SPEECH
 HE SAID TOM SAWYER COULDN'T GET UP NO BETTER PLAN THAN WHAT I HAD
THOUGHT I WOULD KILL SOME GAME NIGH HOME
 I THOUGHT IT ALL OUT AND RECKONED I WOULD BELONG TO THE WIDOW'S IF HE WANTED ME THOUGH I COULDN'T MAKE OUT HOW HE WAS A-GOING TO BE ANY BETTER OFF THEN THAN WHAT HE WAS BEFORE SEEING I WAS SO IGNORANT AND SO KIND OF LOW-DOWN AND ORNERY
 HE SAID THAT THAT WOULD HELP
 AND IF ANYBODY THAT BELONGED TO THE BAND TOLD THE SECRETS HE MUST HAVE HIS THROAT CUT AND THEN HAVE HIS CARCASS BURNT UP AND THE ASHES SCATTERED ALL AROUND AND HIS NAME BLOTTED OFF OF THE LIST WITH BLOOD AND NEVER MENTIONED AGAIN BY THE GANG BUT HAVE A CURSE PUT ON IT AND BE FORGOT FOREVER
BUT I DONE THE BEST I COULD
 A BODY COULD TELL YOU HAIN'T EVER BEEN TO ENGLAND BY THAT
 IT WARN'T QUITE MIDNIGHT YET SO WE CLEARED OUT FOR THE MILL LEAVING JIM AT WORK
 I KNOWED WHAT THE MATTER WAS
 THE FIFTH NIGHT WE PASSED ST LOUIS AND IT WAS LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD LIT UP
SO RIGHT AFTER SUPPER UNCLE WENT
AND THE FIRST THING THE DUKE DONE WAS TO GET DOWN AND LOOK UNDER THE BED
I TOLD YOU WE'D BE TOO SOON
 I COULD A STAYED IF I WANTED TO BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO
 THERE WAS AS MANY AS ONE LOAFER LEANING UP AGAINST EVERY AWNING-POST AND HE MOST ALWAYS HAD HIS HANDS IN HIS BRITCHES-POCKETS EXCEPT WHEN HE FETCHED THEM OUT TO LEND A CHAW OF TOBACCO OR SCRATCH
 I THOUGHT IT ALL OVER AND I RECKONED I WOULD WALK OFF WITH THE GUN AND SOME LINES AND TAKE TO THE WOODS WHEN I RUN AWAY
 WE DID SET HIM FREEME AND TOM
 I MUST LAY IT BY IN MY MIND AND THINK IT OVER SOME TIME OR OTHER IT'S SO KIND OF STRANGE AND UNREGULAR
 YOU'VE ACTED THIS WAY BEFORE
SOMEBODY TRIED TO GET IN SO I WAS LAYING FOR HIM WHY DIDN'T YOU ROUST ME OUT WELL I TRIED TO BUT I COULDN'T
 WE COULD MAKE OUT A BED AND A TABLE AND TWO OLD CHAIRS AND LOTS OF THINGS AROUND ABOUT ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS CLOTHES HANGING AGAINST THE WALL
 _YOU KNOW THEY'LL WAIT FOR YOU
 HE HAD GOT THE DREAM FIXED SO STRONG IN HIS HEAD THAT HE COULDN'T SEEM TO SHAKE IT LOOSE AND GET THE FACTS BACK INTO ITS PLACE AGAIN RIGHT AWAY
 DEY WARN'T GWYNE TO MIX YOU UP IN IT
SO I GOT HOME A HEAP TOO QUICK FOR THAT LENGTH OF A TRIP
AND AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE TOLD IT HE SPREAD IT MORE AND MORE TILL BY AND BY HE SAID THEY RODE HIM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND TIRED HIM MOST TO DEATH AND HIS BACK WAS ALL OVER SADDLE-BOILS
WELL THERE'S OTHERS CAN DO THAT BETTER THAN WHAT I CAN AND THEY'RE PEOPLE THAT AIN'T GOING TO BE DOUBTED AS QUICK AS I'D BE
 DIDN'T YOU NO
THEN HE SHOWED US ANOTHER LITTLE JOB HE'D PRINTED AND HADN'T CHARGED FOR BECAUSE IT WAS FOR US
HADN'T SEEN HIM SINCE THEY WAS BOYS TOGETHERAND HADN'T EVER SEEN HIS BROTHER WILLIAM AT ALLTHAT'S THE DEEF AND DUMB ONEWILLIAM AIN'T MORE THAN THIRTY OR THIRTY-FIVE
 THEN SHE TOLD ME TO TRY FOR THE NEXT ONE
 SAYS HE
AND LEVI BELL THE LAWYER SAYS
 SO TOM SAYS
WELL I'D BEEN SELLING AN ARTICLE TO TAKE THE TARTAR OFF THE TEETHAND IT DOES TAKE IT OFF TOO AND GENERLY THE ENAMEL ALONG WITH ITBUT I STAYED ABOUT ONE NIGHT LONGER THAN I OUGHT TO AND WAS JUST IN THE ACT OF SLIDING OUT WHEN I RAN ACROSS YOU ON THE TRAIL THIS SIDE OF TOWN AND YOU TOLD ME THEY WERE COMING AND BEGGED ME TO HELP YOU TO GET OFF
 THEN I FIXED THE PIECE OF LOG BACK INTO ITS PLACE AND PUT TWO ROCKS UNDER IT AND ONE AGAINST IT TO HOLD IT THERE FOR IT WAS BENT UP AT THAT PLACE AND DIDN'T QUITE TOUCH GROUND
 WHEN I WOKE UP I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS FOR A MINUTE
BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE HAD A GOOD HEART IN HIM AND WAS A GOOD MAN THE FIRST TIME I SEE HIM
NO HE COME CA'M AND IMPORTANT LIKE THE RAM
A GENERAL GOOD TIME.THE HAREM.FRENCH
 YOU DON'T KNOW KINGS JIM BUT I KNOW THEM
 THE DUKE TOLD HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF FREE AND EASY AND IF ANYBODY EVER COME MEDDLING AROUND HE MUST HOP OUT OF THE WIGWAM AND CARRY ON A LITTLE AND FETCH A HOWL OR TWO LIKE A WILD BEAST AND HE RECKONED THEY WOULD LIGHT OUT AND LEAVE HIM ALONE
 I CRIED A LITTLE WHEN I WAS COVERING UP BUCK'S FACE FOR HE WAS MIGHTY GOOD TO ME
NO WAY WOULD DO HIM BUT HE MUST CLIMB UP THE LIGHTNING-ROD
 DEN I RECK'N'D I'D INVES DE THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS RIGHT OFF EN KEEP THINGS A-MOVIN  DEY WUZ A NIGGER NAME BOB DAT HAD KETCHED A WOOD-FLAT EN HIS MARSTER DIDN KNOW IT
 YES I REMEMBER NOW HE DID DIE
JUST LET THE AUCTION GO RIGHT ALONG AND DON'T WORRY
 I JUDGED I WOULD SAW OUT AND LEAVE THAT NIGHT IF PAP GOT DRUNK ENOUGH AND I RECKONED HE WOULD
 I THINK I COULD
THE DECK WAS HIGH OUT HERE
I SAY ORGIES NOT BECAUSE IT'S THE COMMON TERM BECAUSE IT AIN'TOBSEQUIES BEIN THE COMMON TERMBUT BECAUSE ORGIES IS THE RIGHT TERM
 I NEEDN'T TELL WHAT IT WAS HERE BECAUSE I KNOWED IT WOULDN'T STAY THE WAY IT WAS
WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WE COVERED UP THE RAFT THAT WAY FOR AND LAID BY IN THE DAYTIME INSTEAD OF RUNNINGWAS JIM A RUNAWAY NIGGER
BUT IT'S THE PROCTORS MAINLY THAT'S THE NAME I SAYS
 I'M AWFUL SORRY MISS MARY JANE I'M JUST AS SORRY AS I CAN BE
 BUT AFTER THAT WE WAS ALL RIGHT AGAINIT WAS THE SUDDEN SURPRISE OF IT THAT KNOCKED US SO KIND OF COLD
WELL THAT WAS ALL EASY SO WE DONE IT
AND THE BALCONY SCENE IN ROMEO AND JULIET
 THEY WON'T EVER HUNT THE RIVER FOR ANYTHING BUT MY DEAD CARCASS
I WAS ALL OVER WELTS
 NO HE AIN'T
GET THEM JAILED HERE AND THEN LEAVE
ONE MORNING ABOUT DAYBREAK I FOUND A CANOE AND CROSSED OVER A CHUTE TO THE MAIN SHOREIT WAS ONLY TWO HUNDRED YARDSAND PADDLED ABOUT A MILE UP A CRICK AMONGST THE CYPRESS WOODS TO SEE IF I COULDN'T GET SOME BERRIES
 MY BED WAS A STRAW TICK BETTER THAN JIM'S WHICH WAS A CORN-SHUCK TICK
 BUT WE'VE GOT THEM ON OUR HANDS AND WE GOT TO REMEMBER WHAT THEY ARE AND MAKE ALLOWANCES
 HE HAD AN OLD LONG-TAILED BLUE JEANS COAT WITH SLICK BRASS BUTTONS FLUNG OVER HIS ARM AND BOTH OF THEM HAD BIG FAT RATTY-LOOKING CARPET-BAGS
BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT THAT FOR PRETTY SOON ALL OF A SUDDEN ALONG COMES A REGULAR RIPPER AND WASHED ME OVERBOARD
WROTE GENTLEMEN GENTLEMEN JIM LIT OUT THE KING SHAKES HUCK THE DUKE WENT FOR HIM SPANISH MOSS WHO NAILED HIM THINKING HE GAVE HIM TEN CENTS STRIKING FOR THE BACK COUNTRY STILL AND SUNDAY-LIKE SHE HUGGED HIM TIGHT WHO DO YOU RECKON IT IS IT WAS TOM SAWYER MR ARCHIBALD NICHOLS I PRESUME A PRETTY LONG BLESSING TRAVELING BY RAIL VITTLES A SIMPLE JOB WITCHES GETTING WOOD ONE OF THE BEST AUTHORITIES THE BREAKFAST-HORN SMOUCHING THE KNIVES GOING DOWN THE LIGHTNING-ROD STEALING SPOONS TOM ADVISES A WITCH PIE THE RUBBAGE-PILE MISSUS DEY'S A SHEET GONE IN A TEARING WAY ONE OF HIS ANCESTORS JIM'S COAT OF ARMS A TOUGH JOB BUTTONS ON THEIR TAILS IRRIGATION KEEPING OFF DULL TIMES SAWDUST DIET TROUBLE IS BREWING FISHING EVERY ONE HAD A GUN TOM CAUGHT ON A SPLINTER JIM ADVISES A DOCTOR THE DOCTOR UNCLE SILAS IN DANGER OLD MRS HOTCHKISS AUNT SALLY TALKS TO HUCK TOM SAWYER WOUNDED THE DOCTOR SPEAKS FOR JIM TOM ROSE SQUARE UP IN BED HAND OUT THEM LETTERS OUT OF BONDAGE TOM'S
AND ONE MINUTE YOU COULD SEE EVERYTHING AND EVERY FACE IN THAT BIG CROWD AND THE SHOVELFULS OF DIRT SAILING UP OUT OF THE GRAVE AND THE NEXT SECOND THE DARK WIPED IT ALL OUT AND YOU COULDN'T SEE NOTHING AT ALL
 THAT MADE ME PRETTY UNEASY AGAIN BUT ONLY FOR A MINUTE
 I RECKONED I WOULD HAVE GREAT TIMES NOW IF I WAS OVER AT THE TOWN
AND HE WAS BRIGHT AND NOT LEATHER-HEADED
 YOU TRYTHAT'S ALL I ASK
 HAVE YOU EVER TROD THE BOARDS ROYALTY NO SAYS THE KING
AND SO JIM GOT EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT AND AS SOON AS HE WAS BY HIMSELF HE BUSTED INTO THE PIE AND HID THE ROPE LADDER INSIDE OF HIS STRAW TICK AND SCRATCHED SOME MARKS ON A TIN PLATE AND THROWED IT OUT OF THE WINDOW-HOLE
 FIRST I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
HE WAS OVER FIFTY YEAR OLD AND HAD A VERY RED FACE
 YOU DONE IT AND YOU GOT TO SAY YOU DONE IT OR THE KING BEGAN TO GURGLE AND THEN HE GASPS OUT
COME OUT AND MEET THE MAN YOU'VE SWINDLED
LOG SMOKE-HOUSE BACK OF THE KITCHEN
HE SAID IT WOULDN'T TALK
 I WOULDN'T LOSE NO TIME WELL WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST LOOK AT IT A MINUTE AND MAYBE YOU CAN SEE
 I CREPT UP THE DEAD WATER UNDER THE BANK AND HADN'T NO ACCIDENTS AND DIDN'T SEE NOBODY
 DO YOU WANT TO SPREAD IT ALL OVER WELL SAYS I A-BLUBBERING I'VE TOLD EVERYBODY BEFORE AND THEY JUST WENT AWAY AND LEFT US POOR DEVIL THERE'S SOMETHING IN THAT
 IF YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH AGAINST ME ONLY ONCE AFTER THAT TIME YOU CAN'T TRAVEL SO FAR BUT I WILL FIND YOU THEN HE TURNS AND GOES IN
SO YOU JUST PUT TWENTY MILES BETWEEN US THAT'S A GOOD BOY
 YOU ANSWER ME THAT IS A CAT A MAN HUCK NO WELL DEN DEY AIN'T NO SENSE IN A CAT TALKIN LIKE A MAN
 IT WAS AN AWFUL SIGHT OF MONEY WHEN IT WAS PILED UP
 YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO AND WHATEVER YOU SAY I'LL DO IT WELL I SAYS IT'S A ROUGH GANG THEM TWO FRAUDS AND I'M FIXED SO I GOT TO TRAVEL WITH THEM A WHILE LONGER WHETHER I WANT TO OR NOTI DRUTHER NOT TELL YOU WHY
 I NEVER SEE SUCH A SON
 WHY HAIN'T YOU EVER READ ANY BOOKS AT ALL?BARON TRENCK NOR CASANOVA NOR BENVENUTO CHELLEENY NOR HENRI IV NOR NONE OF THEM HEROES
 BUT I DIDN'T SEE NO JOKE ABOUT IT AND I JUDGED IT WOULD STRAIN THE DUKE AND THE KING SOME TO SEE ANY
 AFTER MIDNIGHT HE'LL LIKELY BE ASLEEP AND THEY CAN SLIP AROUND THROUGH THE WOODS AND HUNT UP HIS CAMP FIRE ALL THE BETTER FOR THE DARK IF HE'S GOT ONE I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT THE WOMAN KEPT LOOKING AT ME PRETTY CURIOUS AND I DIDN'T FEEL A BIT COMFORTABLE
IF IT WARN'T SO I WOULDN'T APPROVE OF IT NOR I WOULDN'T STAND BY AND SEE THE RULES BROKEBECAUSE RIGHT IS RIGHT AND WRONG IS WRONG AND A BODY AIN'T GOT NO BUSINESS DOING WRONG WHEN HE AIN'T IGNORANT AND KNOWS BETTER
WE RUMMAGED THE CLOTHES WE'D GOT AND FOUND EIGHT DOLLARS IN SILVER SEWED UP IN THE LINING OF AN OLD BLANKET OVERCOAT
TRYING TO BETTER IT I'VE WORSENED IT A HUNDRED TIMES AND I WISH TO GOODNESS I'D JUST LET IT ALONE DAD FETCH THE WHOLE BUSINESS
 SHE WUZ ON DE CLO'SLINE YISTIDDY BUT SHE DONE GONE
DEY'S PLENTY MO  A CHILE ER TWO MO ER LESS WARN'T NO CONSEKENS TO SOLLERMUN DAD FATCH HIM I NEVER SEE SUCH A NIGGER
 YOU MEAN YOU'RE THE LATE CHARLEMAGNE
BUT NOT THE SNAKES AND TURTLESTHEY WOULD SLIDE OFF IN THE WATER
HUCK AND THE WOMAN.THE SEARCH.PREVARICATION.GOING TO GOSHEN
AND POOR AS HE WAS HE WAS GOING TO START RIGHT OFF AND WORK HIS WAY BACK TO THE INDIAN OCEAN AND PUT IN THE REST OF HIS LIFE TRYING TO TURN THE PIRATES INTO THE TRUE PATH
 STEAMBOAT CAPTAINS IS ALWAYS RICH AND GET SIXTY DOLLARS A MONTH AND THEY DON'T CARE A CENT WHAT A THING COSTS YOU KNOW LONG AS THEY WANT IT
 WELL DEN YOU KIN GIT YO MONEY WHEN YOU WANTS IT KASE DAT WUZ HIM TOM'S MOST WELL NOW AND GOT HIS BULLET AROUND HIS NECK ON A WATCH-GUARD FOR A WATCH AND IS ALWAYS SEEING WHAT TIME IT IS AND SO THERE AIN'T NOTHING MORE TO WRITE ABOUT AND I AM ROTTEN GLAD OF IT BECAUSE IF I'D A KNOWED WHAT A TROUBLE IT WAS TO MAKE A BOOK I WOULDN'T A TACKLED IT AND AIN'T A-GOING TO NO MORE
 WE'D GOT TO FIND THAT BOAT NOWHAD TO HAVE IT FOR OURSELVES
 I SEE THE MOON GO OFF WATCH AND THE DARKNESS BEGIN TO BLANKET THE RIVER
LAYING FOR HIM.LOCKED IN THE CABIN.SINKING THE BODY.RESTING
AND WHILST THE OTHERS WAS LEAVING THE KEY COME FROM THE HOUSE
AND JIM'S EYES BUGGED OUT AND HE WAS INTERESTED
OR WHAT I WANT IS MY SUNDAY-SCHOOL BOOK
 I HAIN'T BEEN GONE ANYWHERES
 WELL I SAYS TO MYSELF AT LAST I'M A-GOING TO CHANCE IT
 WE'D SKIN HIM IF HE DONE THAT HOW CAN HE BLOW
 YOU MAY SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO BUT IN MY OPINION SHE HAD MORE SAND IN HER THAN ANY GIRL I EVER SEE
 WHY I WANTED THE ADVENTURE OF IT
THEN WE SLID BY PRETTY WIDE AWAY FROM THE TOWN AND DIDN'T HOIST OUR LANTERN TILL WE WAS CLEAR OUT OF SIGHT OF IT
 EVERY TIME HE GOT MONEY HE GOT DRUNK
TIS MY FATE
 I SAID I WOULD
THE TRIP TO ENGLAND."THE BRUTE!"MARY JANE DECIDES TO LEAVE.HUCK PARTING WITH MARY JANE.MUMPS.THE OPPOSITION LINE
HE SAID THAT YESTERDAY
THAT'S THE WHOLE YARNWHAT'S YOURN
 LIVING IN A HOUSE AND SLEEPING IN A BED PULLED ON ME PRETTY TIGHT MOSTLY BUT BEFORE THE COLD WEATHER I USED TO SLIDE OUT AND SLEEP IN THE WOODS SOMETIMES AND SO THAT WAS A REST TO ME
EN DEY AIN NO SENSE IN SICH DOIN'S AS DAT
 YOU HAVE CERT'NLY GOT THE MOST ASTONISHIN HEAD I EVER SEE
TO THE BITTER DEATH  HE TOOK THE OLD MAN BY THE HAND AND SQUEEZED IT AND SAYS THAT SECRET OF YOUR BEING
 HE COULD OUT-SUPERINTEND ANY BOY I EVER SEE
 THAT'S THE ONE WHICH THE PRISONER HAS TO SCRABBLE ON THE WALL
IT MADE YOU FEEL CRAWLY
BUT HE SAID HE HAD BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY SO LONG AND HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE HE'D FORGOT IT
I RECKON I MIGHT SAY THEY SWUM BY THEY SLID ALONG SO QUIET AND SMOOTH AND LOVELY
 I THOUGHT WE WAS RIGHT ON THE TRACK OF A SOLUTION BUT IT'S GONE TO GRASS PARTLY
AND SURE ENOUGH WHEN THE NEXT FLASH BUSTED OUT OVER THE WATER HERE THEY COME!AND JUST A-LAYING TO THEIR OARS AND MAKING THEIR SKIFF HUM
THEY ALL HEARD ME
 I TALKED ALONG BUT HE ONLY SET THERE AND LOOKED AT ME
 THE SHIRT WAS SENT IN EARLY IN A PIE AND EVERY TIME A RAT BIT JIM HE WOULD GET UP AND WRITE A LITTLE IN HIS JOURNAL WHILST THE INK WAS FRESH
 SO I HOLLERED AGAIN AND THEN JIM SAYS
 WHAR IS YOU
 WELL WHEN THE RIVER ROSE PA HAD A STREAK OF LUCK ONE DAY
COME OUT HERE SHERBURN
 WHY HE'LL SAY IT'S A GREAT PITY BUT MY CHURCH MATTERS HAS GOT TO GET ALONG THE BEST WAY THEY CAN
 THEN THE SWELLING WAS ALL GONE AND HE WAS AROUND AGAIN
 OF COURSE I WAS WHERE THE CURRENT SET IN THE CLOSEST TO THE SHOREI KNOWED ENOUGH FOR THAT
THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT HIM SOMEBODY SAYS
HOORAY THEY ALL SHOUTED AND WAS STARTING RIGHT OFF
 I COULDN'T GET MY BREATH FOR MOST A MINUTE
EVERYBODY BUYS SOME OF HIM
 WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING REASONABLE RIGHT OFF THAT WAY SO I SAYS
 AFTER BREAKFAST WE ALL LAID OFF AND TALKED AND THE FIRST THING THAT COME OUT WAS THAT THESE CHAPS DIDN'T KNOW ONE ANOTHER
 AND CUT IT MIDDLIN SHORT BECAUSE IT'S BETTER FOR US TO BE DOWN THERE A-WHOOPIN UP THE MOURNIN THAN UP HERE GIVIN EM A CHANCE TO TALK US OVER WELL THIS IS IT CAPET
EVERYBODY THAT SEEN THE SHOOTING WAS TELLING HOW IT HAPPENED AND THERE WAS A BIG CROWD PACKED AROUND EACH ONE OF THESE FELLOWS STRETCHING THEIR NECKS AND LISTENING
 I AIN'T A-GOING TO TELL ALL THAT HAPPENEDIT WOULD MAKE ME SICK AGAIN IF I WAS TO DO THAT
AND SO WAS HIS FAMILY
 IN HOOKERVILLE SEVEN MILE BELOW
 I NEVER SEE THE BEAT OF IT IN ALL MY BORN DAYS
 WE NEVER GOT HIM TILL DARK
 DO YOU RECKON THAT LL DO OH YES SO I WROTE
I KNOW IT BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME SO HERSELF ALL RIGHT THEY SAID AND CLEARED OUT TO LAY FOR THEIR UNCLES AND GIVE THEM THE LOVE AND THE KISSES AND TELL THEM THE MESSAGE
 YOU BETTER BET THEY DO WITH THESE MUMPS
 ABOUT BROAD DAY IN THE MORNING THE KING AND THE DUKE COME UP IN THE GARRET AND WOKE ME UP AND I SEE BY THEIR LOOK THAT THERE WAS TROUBLE
THAT'S THE REASON
 WE CLEARED EVERYTHING OUT OF THE WAY ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE FOOT ALONG THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTOM LOG
 EN WHAT DEY GOT TO DO HUCK THEY DON'T DO NOTHING
 AND THE NEXT TIME I WAS HEADING AWAY TO THE LEFT OF ITAND NOT GAINING ON IT MUCH EITHER FOR I WAS FLYING AROUND THIS WAY AND THAT AND T'OTHER BUT IT WAS GOING STRAIGHT AHEAD ALL THE TIME
BUT THAT TRICK TOOK EM TO THE GRAVEYARD AND THE GOLD DONE US A STILL BIGGER KINDNESS
 HE SAID IT WAS A SIGN WHEN YOUNG CHICKENS FLEW THAT WAY AND SO HE RECKONED IT WAS THE SAME WAY WHEN YOUNG BIRDS DONE IT
 A MAN HAS A QUARREL WITH ANOTHER MAN AND KILLS HIM
 BUT WE GOT TO HAVE IT ANYWAY
WELL THE MEN GATHERED AROUND AND SYMPATHIZED WITH THEM AND SAID ALL SORTS OF KIND THINGS TO THEM AND CARRIED THEIR CARPET-BAGS UP THE HILL FOR THEM AND LET THEM LEAN ON THEM AND CRY AND TOLD THE KING ALL ABOUT HIS BROTHER'S LAST MOMENTS AND THE KING HE TOLD IT ALL OVER AGAIN ON HIS HANDS TO THE DUKE AND BOTH OF THEM TOOK ON ABOUT THAT DEAD TANNER LIKE THEY'D LOST THE TWELVE DISCIPLES
 WELL BY NIGHT I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE SNAKE AND WHEN JIM FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN ON THE BLANKET WHILE I STRUCK A LIGHT THE SNAKE'S MATE WAS THERE AND BIT HIM
 IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE HUNGRY
FOR THE HOUSE WAS ALL AS STILL AS DEATH NOW AND SO THE WIDOW WOULDN'T KNOW
IF EMMELINE GRANGERFORD COULD MAKE POETRY LIKE THAT BEFORE SHE WAS FOURTEEN THERE AIN'T NO TELLING WHAT SHE COULD A DONE BY AND BY
 HANDCUFFS AND CHAINS WOULD LOOK STILL BETTER ON JIM BUT IT WOULDN'T GO WELL WITH THE STORY OF US BEING SO POOR
IT WAS LAID IN BETWEEN A RAFTER AND THE CLAPBOARDS OF THE ROOF
I HAD TO CLAW AWAY FROM THE BANK PRETTY LIVELY FOUR OR FIVE TIMES TO KEEP FROM KNOCKING THE ISLANDS OUT OF THE RIVER
BUT MY KINGDOM
 SHE WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN AND VERY SWEET AND GENTLE LOOKING BUT AWFUL PALE AND SCARED
WELL I FELT SHEEPISH ENOUGH TO BE TOOK IN SO BUT I WOULDN'T A BEEN IN THAT RINGMASTER'S PLACE NOT FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS
 IT WARN'T EARLY BECAUSE I OVERSLEPT
I STAYED IN THE TREE TILL IT BEGUN TO GET DARK AFRAID TO COME DOWN
 I RANSACKED IT BUT COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING ELSE
 I KNOWED WHAT WAS THE MATTER NOW
 _WE HAIN'T DONE NOTHING NO I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T
THAT'S THE DEAD
THE JUDGE HE FELT KIND OF SORE
AND SHE SET HIM FREE IN HER WILL THEN WHAT ON EARTH DID YOU WANT TO SET HIM FREE FOR SEEING HE WAS ALREADY FREE WELL THAT IS A QUESTION I MUST SAY
 IT WAS ALL BLACK NO GRAY
 THERE WAS A HYMN BOOK AND A LOT OF OTHER BOOKS
 HE GOT TO GOING AWAY SO MUCH TOO AND LOCKING ME IN
JIM AND ME COME UP ALL RIGHT BUT PA WAS DRUNK AND IKE WAS ONLY FOUR YEARS OLD SO THEY NEVER COME UP NO MORE
I HAIN'T COME BACKI HAIN'T BEEN GONE WHEN HE HEARD MY VOICE IT RIGHTED HIM UP SOME BUT HE WARN'T QUITE SATISFIED YET
BUT JUST AS I SUSPICIONED HE WARN'T THERE
BEIN BROTHERS TO A RICH DEAD MAN AND REPRESENTATIVES OF FURRIN HEIRS THAT'S GOT LEFT IS THE LINE FOR YOU AND ME BILGE
 COME DON'T WASTE A MINUTENOT A SECOND_WE'LL HAVE THEM TARRED AND FEATHERED AND FLUNG IN THE RIVER SAYS I
BUT WHAT DID YOU SAY WHEN I FETCHED IN THE SNAKE-SKIN THAT I FOUND ON THE TOP OF THE RIDGE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
 BUT THE REST WAS ON HAND AND SO THEY ALL COME AND SHOOK HANDS WITH THE KING AND THANKED HIM AND TALKED TO HIM
BUT I NEVER SAID NOTHING OF COURSE
OH YES THIS IS A WONDERFUL GOVMENT WONDERFUL
 IT WAS KIND OF SOLEMN DRIFTING DOWN THE BIG STILL RIVER LAYING ON OUR BACKS LOOKING UP AT THE STARS AND WE DIDN'T EVER FEEL LIKE TALKING LOUD AND IT WARN'T OFTEN THAT WE LAUGHEDONLY A LITTLE KIND OF A LOW CHUCKLE
BUT I LAY I'D MAKE THAT MAN CLIMB THE HIGHEST TREE THERE WAS IN THE COUNTRY SHUCKS IT AIN'T NO USE TO TALK TO YOU HUCK FINN
AND IT GOT AWFUL DARK AND THE RAIN STARTED AND THE WIND SWISHED AND SWUSHED ALONG AND THE LIGHTNING COME BRISKER AND BRISKER AND THE THUNDER BOOMED
 HE DIDN'T EVER HAVE TO TELL ANYBODY TO MIND THEIR MANNERSEVERYBODY WAS ALWAYS GOOD-MANNERED WHERE HE WAS
IT AIN'T GOOD SENSE IT AIN'T GOOD MORALS
AND IF ANYBODY DONE ANYTHING TO ANY BOY IN THE BAND WHICHEVER BOY WAS ORDERED TO KILL THAT PERSON AND HIS FAMILY MUST DO IT AND HE MUSTN'T EAT AND HE MUSTN'T SLEEP TILL HE HAD KILLED THEM AND HACKED A CROSS IN THEIR BREASTS WHICH WAS THE SIGN OF THE BAND
I HAD A COUPLE OF PATIENTS WITH THE CHILLS AND OF COURSE I'D OF LIKED TO RUN UP TO TOWN AND SEE THEM BUT I DASN'T BECAUSE THE NIGGER MIGHT GET AWAY AND THEN I'D BE TO BLAME
SO I TOOK MY PADDLE AND SLID OUT FROM SHORE JUST A STEP OR TWO AND THEN LET THE CANOE DROP ALONG DOWN AMONGST THE SHADOWS
 THEY COULDN'T HIT NO PROJECT THAT SUITED EXACTLY
 BUT WHILE WE WAS GONE FOR SPIDERS LITTLE THOMAS FRANKLIN BENJAMIN JEFFERSON ELEXANDER PHELPS FOUND IT THERE AND OPENED THE DOOR OF IT TO SEE IF THE RATS WOULD COME OUT AND THEY DID
NEXT FOR ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR I WHOOPS NOW AND THEN
 THE KING ALLOWED HE WOULD GO TOO AND SEE IF HE COULDN'T STRIKE SOMETHING
 I CAN'T
INDEED I WILL
 BUT I RECKONED THAT WITH HER DISPOSITION SHE WAS HAVING A BETTER TIME IN THE GRAVEYARD
I'D RUTHER NOT TELL YOU WHERE I PUT IT MISS MARY JANE IF YOU DON'T MIND LETTING ME OFF
 A NIGGER ROUSTED ME OUT THIS MORNIN AND TOLD ME THE PEOPLE WAS GETHERIN ON THE QUIET WITH THEIR DOGS AND HORSES AND THEY'D BE ALONG PRETTY SOON AND GIVE ME BOUT HALF AN HOUR'S START AND THEN RUN ME DOWN IF THEY COULD
 IT GOT DARKER AND DARKER AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL TIME TO GIVE THE CROWD THE SLIP
GOES THREE OR FOUR GUNSTHE MEN HAD SLIPPED AROUND THROUGH THE WOODS AND COME IN FROM BEHIND WITHOUT THEIR HORSES
 YOU OUGHT TO BEEN ASHAMED OF YOURSELF TO STAND BY AND HEAR IT SADDLED ON TO A LOT OF POOR NIGGERS AND YOU NEVER SAY A WORD FOR EM
 WE SEE IT WARN'T NO USE
IT AIN'T REGULAR WELL THEN WHAT'LL WE MAKE HIM THE INK OUT OF MANY MAKES IT OUT OF IRON-RUST AND TEARS
THAT NIGHT WE WENT DOWN THE LIGHTNING-ROD A LITTLE AFTER TEN AND TOOK ONE OF THE CANDLES ALONG AND LISTENED UNDER THE WINDOW-HOLE AND HEARD JIM SNORING
AND BESIDES IT WAS JUST AS I SAID
 DON'T YOU TRY TO LAND BY YOURSELF OR YOU'LL SMASH EVERYTHING TO PIECES
JIM SAID HE RECKONED I WOULD BELIEVE HIM NEXT TIME
 I WANTED TO BE GETTING AWAY BEFORE THE OLD MAN GOT BACK BUT OF COURSE I DIDN'T LET ON
 BUT HE'LL BE POOTY LONESOMEDEY AIN NO KINGS HERE IS DEY HUCK NO DEN HE CAIN'T GIT NO SITUATION
 SARAH'S MY FIRST NAME
 JIM GOT OUT HIS HAIR-BALL AND SAID SOMETHING OVER IT AND THEN HE HELD IT UP AND DROPPED IT ON THE FLOOR
 YOU DON'T SEEM TO KNOW ANYTHING SOMEHOWPERFECT SAPHEAD I THOUGHT ALL THIS OVER FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND THEN I RECKONED I WOULD SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING IN IT
BUT I COULDN'T A GONE TO SLEEP IF I'D A WANTED TO I WAS IN SUCH A SWEAT TO GET THROUGH WITH THE BUSINESS
HOLD ON'D YOU GO THROUGH HIM NO
I'LL ANSWER BY DOING THE HIGHLAND FLING OR THE SAILOR'S HORNPIPE
ME-YOW DOWN THERE
 SO I KNEELED DOWN
HOW ARE YOU ON THE DEEF AND DUMB BILGEWATER THE DUKE SAID LEAVE HIM ALONE FOR THAT
 THAT IS JUST THE WAY WITH SOME PEOPLE
 I WISH WE COULD HAVE SOME BAD LUCK LIKE THIS EVERY DAY JIM NEVER YOU MIND HONEY NEVER YOU MIND
 I SLEPT IN THE WOODS ALL NIGHT
TAKE HIM OFF
FOR I FORGOT HE WAS OLD KING LEAR AND A DROWNDED A-RAB ALL IN ONE AND IT MOST SCARED THE LIVERS AND LIGHTS OUT OF ME
NEXT DAY WAS AUCTION DAY
 BUT I SAID NO
 I'LL NEVER FORGIT YOU LONG'S I LIVE SAYS THE MAN ON THE FLOOR SORT OF BLUBBERING
SOME THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KILL THE FAMILIES OF BOYS THAT TOLD THE SECRETS
AND THE SAME SECOND THE HOUSE AND ALL WAS BEHIND ME IN THE DARK AND WASN'T EVER GOING TO BE BEFORE ME NO MORE IN THIS WORLD
 YOU WANT TO SELL ALL YOUR PROPERTY TO MENOT GIVE IT
DEY WAS ALL OVER ME
THEN THE BED HID HIM
 SO THERE AIN'T NO DOUBT BUT THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT THINGTHAT IS THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT WHEN A BODY LIKE THE WIDOW OR THE PARSON PRAYS BUT IT DON'T WORK FOR ME AND I RECKON IT DON'T WORK FOR ONLY JUST THE RIGHT KIND
 DOAN TALK TO ME BOUT YO PINTS
WHY TO SAW JIM'S LEG OFF HE SAYS
THEN I DOUBLED BACK THROUGH THE WOODS TOWARDS PHELPS  I RECKONED I BETTER START IN ON MY PLAN STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT FOOLING AROUND BECAUSE I WANTED TO STOP JIM'S MOUTH TILL THESE FELLOWS COULD GET AWAY
AND THE MINUTE THE WORDS WERE OUT OF HIS MOUTH SOMEBODY OVER IN THE CROWD STRUCK UP THE DOXOLOJER AND EVERYBODY JOINED IN WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT AND IT JUST WARMED YOU UP AND MADE YOU FEEL AS GOOD AS CHURCH LETTING OUT
 THE READING WAS ALL ABOUT JIM AND JUST DESCRIBED HIM TO A DOT
I NEVER SEE SUCH AN OLD OSTRICH FOR WANTING TO GOBBLE EVERYTHINGAND I A-TRUSTING YOU ALL THE TIME LIKE YOU WAS MY OWN FATHER
SO HE SAID COURTS MUSTN'T INTERFERE AND SEPARATE FAMILIES IF THEY COULD HELP IT
 YOU BETTER STAY HERE ALL NIGHT
DID YOU WANT TO KILL HIM BUCK WELL I BET I DID WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU HIM
I WON'T EVER DO IT AGAINTILL YOU ASK ME TILL I ASK YOU
AND EVERY TIME HE RAISED CAIN HE GOT JAILED
 WHAR WAS YOU BROUGHT DOWN FROM AH YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME
 THE DOCTOR SAYS
 THE DOCTOR SAYS
THEY READ LIKE THIS
 YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
 EN I WARN'T GWYNE TO SHOW MYSEF ON DE BANK IN DE DAYTIME WELL THAT'S SO
I WAKED HIM UP AND I RECKONED IT WAS GOING TO BE A GRAND SURPRISE TO HIM TO SEE ME AGAIN BUT IT WARN'T
HOGS SOON WENT WILD IN THEM BOTTOMS AFTER THEY HAD GOT AWAY FROM THE PRAIRIE FARMS
THE THRILLING MASTERLY AND BLOOD-CURDLING BROAD-SWORD CONFLICT IN RICHARD III
 WELL WE CAN'T HELP IT
 LOOK UPON IT AND LIVE  AND PEOPLE WOULD SHOUT OUT GLORY!A-A-_MEN  AND SO HE WENT ON AND THE PEOPLE GROANING AND CRYING AND SAYING AMEN
 I SAT DOWN THERE ON A LOG AND LOOKED OUT THROUGH THE LEAVES
 IT AMOUNTED TO SOMETHING BEING A RAFTSMAN ON SUCH A CRAFT AS THAT
 THEY LAID HIM ON THE FLOOR AND PUT ONE LARGE BIBLE UNDER HIS HEAD AND OPENED ANOTHER ONE AND SPREAD IT ON HIS BREAST
THEY WAS FETCHING A VERY NICE-LOOKING OLD GENTLEMAN ALONG AND A NICE-LOOKING YOUNGER ONE WITH HIS RIGHT ARM IN A SLING
 I WAS TOO SCARED
 IT'S AMUSING
 NOW DAT'S WHAT I WANTS TO KNOW WELL I THINK YOU'RE HERE PLAIN ENOUGH BUT I THINK YOU'RE A TANGLE-HEADED OLD FOOL JIM I IS IS I
AND THEY KEPT ON PILING IN TILL THERE WAS ELEVEN OF THEM AND THERE WARN'T HARDLY ROOM IN THERE TO GET YOUR BREATH
 THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TIME
 THEN WE WHIRLED IN WITH THE PICK AND SHOVEL AND IN ABOUT TWO HOURS AND A HALF THE JOB WAS DONE
I TOOK THE WADDING
 WE CREPT IN UNDER JIM'S BED AND INTO THE CABIN AND PAWED AROUND AND FOUND THE CANDLE AND LIT IT AND STOOD OVER JIM AWHILE AND FOUND HIM LOOKING HEARTY AND HEALTHY AND THEN WE WOKE HIM UP GENTLE AND GRADUAL
DON'T YOU WHAT ME YOU IMPUDENT THINGHAND OUT THEM LETTERS WHAT LETTERS THEM LETTERS
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW BUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE THREE DAYS TO FIX IT
NO SIR WE'D A WHOOPED HIM OVER THE BORDER_THAT'S WHAT WE'D A DONE WITH HIM_AND DONE IT JUST AS SLICK AS NOTHING AT ALL TOO
 HE COLLARED IT
THEY ASKED US CONSIDERABLE MANY QUESTIONS
 WHAT DOES THE PRISONER CARE WHOSE HE BROKE OFF THERE BECAUSE WE HEARD THE BREAKFAST-HORN BLOWING
THEY'RE IN AN AWFUL PECK OF TROUBLE AND WHO IS WHY PAP AND MAM AND SIS AND MISS HOOKER
 COME UP THE STAIRS AND LET ON IT'S A LIGHTNING-ROD SO HE DONE IT
SO THE BEST WAY WOULD BE FOR US TO PICK OUT TWO OR THREE THINGS FROM THE LIST AND SAY WE WOULDN'T BORROW THEM ANY MORETHEN HE RECKONED IT WOULDN'T BE NO HARM TO BORROW THE OTHERS
AND THE PLACE WAS PLUM FULL OF FARMERS AND FARMERS WIVES TO DINNER
 THE PEOPLE THAT BUYS THE PROPERTY IS THE SUFF'RERS
 TOM WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS
SHE GOT MAD THEN BUT I DIDN'T MEAN NO HARM
SO HE LIT UP HIS LANTERN AND GOT HIS SADDLE-BAGS AND WE STARTED
 HERE A POOR PRISONER FORSOOK BY THE WORLD AND FRIENDS FRETTED HIS SORROWFUL LIFE
NAKED TOO
HE AIN'T OUR NIGGER AND HIS OWNER WOULD TURN UP AND MAKE US PAY FOR HIM SURE
THEN IN A SECOND OR TWO MORE WE WAS A HUNDRED YARDS BELOW THE WRECK AND THE DARKNESS SOAKED HER UP EVERY LAST SIGN OF HER AND WE WAS SAFE AND KNOWED IT
 THERE WARN'T NOBODY AROUND BUT THE FAMILY AND THE WIDOW BARTLEY AND OUR TRIBE
 I SHOT OUT AND WENT FOR THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE BUT THEY TOLD ME HE'D GONE AWAY IN THE NIGHT SOME TIME OR OTHER AND WARN'T BACK YET
EVERY NIGHT WE PASSED TOWNS SOME OF THEM AWAY UP ON BLACK HILLSIDES NOTHING BUT JUST A SHINY BED OF LIGHTS
 LOOK AT IT SAYS ISUCH A HAT FOR ME TO WEARONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN IN THIS TOWN IF I COULD GIT MY RIGHTS
WELL PRETTY SOON THE OLD MAN WAS UP AND AROUND AGAIN AND THEN HE WENT FOR JUDGE THATCHER IN THE COURTS TO MAKE HIM GIVE UP THAT MONEY AND HE WENT FOR ME TOO FOR NOT STOPPING SCHOOL
THE EXTREMEST FORM OF THE BACKWOODS SOUTHWESTERN DIALECT
 DO YOU RECKON TOM SAWYER WOULD EVER GO BY THIS THING
AND THEN HOW THEY BOTH DID FIRE OFF QUESTIONS ABOUT SID AND MARY AND THE REST OF THE TRIBE
 SO WHEN I SAYS HE GOES TO OUR CHURCH SHE SAYS
 THE BOAT LANDED JUST AT DAYLIGHT AND I LEFT MY BAGGAGE ON THE WHARF-BOAT AND WENT LOOKING AROUND THE TOWN AND OUT A PIECE IN THE COUNTRY TO PUT IN THE TIME AND NOT GET HERE TOO SOON
 THE LAW TAKES A MAN WORTH SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS AND UP'ARDS AND JAMS HIM INTO AN OLD TRAP OF A CABIN LIKE THIS AND LETS HIM GO ROUND IN CLOTHES THAT AIN'T FITTEN FOR A HOG
SO I CHANGED OFF AND WENT THAT WAY
BUT I DIDN'T SEE NOTHING I DIDN'T HEAR NOTHINGI ONLY THOUGHT I HEARD AND SEEN AS MUCH AS A THOUSAND THINGS
 IT'S A WORD THAT'S MADE UP OUT'N THE GREEK ORGO OUTSIDE OPEN ABROAD
 BUT NEVER MINDLET IT GO
 WE FOUND IT
 I CAN'T MAKE IT OUT SOMEHOW
 WHERE IN THAT HUT DOWN BY THE ASH-HOPPER
 THEY TALKED LOW AND EARNEST
 YOU COULD SEE THEM FIRST-RATE NOW
I COULDN'T STAY STILL IN ONE PLACE
 I SAYS TO SISTER DUNLAP S'I WHY DOG MY CATS THEY MUST A BEN A HOUSE-FULL O NIGGERS IN THERE EVERY NIGHT FOR FOUR WEEKS TO A DONE ALL THAT WORK SISTER PHELPS
 AND SUCH ANOTHER POWWOW AS THEY MADE
 THE DUKE SHED HIS COAT AND SAID HE WAS ALL RIGHT NOW
 WHENEVER HIS LIQUOR BEGUN TO WORK HE MOST ALWAYS WENT FOR THE GOVMENT THIS TIME HE SAYS
 WE SEEN A LIGHT NOW AWAY DOWN TO THE RIGHT ON SHORE
YO OLE FATHER DOAN KNOW YIT WHAT HE'S A-GWYNE TO DO
WHY WHO'S THAT WHO DO YOU RECKON T IS I HAIN'T NO IDEA
 WE WENT SNEAKING DOWN THE SLOPE OF IT TO LABBOARD IN THE DARK TOWARDS THE TEXAS FEELING OUR WAY SLOW WITH OUR FEET AND SPREADING OUR HANDS OUT TO FEND OFF THE GUYS FOR IT WAS SO DARK WE COULDN'T SEE NO SIGN OF THEM
FOR THE RIVER WAS PRETTY HIGH YET VERY LOW BANKS BEING STILL A LITTLE UNDER WATER
 I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN A PEG BEFORE I GET DONE WITH YOU
 BUT TOM GIVE HIM FIVE CENTS TO KEEP QUIET AND SAID WE WOULD ALL GO HOME AND MEET NEXT WEEK AND ROB SOMEBODY AND KILL SOME PEOPLE
WAKE DUNCAN WITH THY KNOCKING
 I WENT TO THINKING OUT A PLAN BUT ONLY JUST TO BE DOING SOMETHING
BUT THEY DIDN'T MAKE ENOUGH FOR THEM BOTH TO GET DRUNK ON
THE DUKE WENT DOWN INTO HIS CARPET-BAG AND FETCHED UP A LOT OF LITTLE PRINTED BILLS AND READ THEM OUT LOUD
 SOMETIMES DEY'D PULL UP AT DE SHO EN TAKE A RES B'FO DEY STARTED ACROST SO BY DE TALK I GOT TO KNOW ALL BOUT DE KILLIN  I UZ POWERFUL SORRY YOU'S KILLED HUCK BUT I AIN'T NO MO NOW
 DE BES WAY IS TO RES EASY EN LET DE OLE MAN TAKE HIS OWN WAY
SO I JUST LET IT GO AND NEVER BOTHERED NO MORE ABOUT IT
WELL THE DAYS WENT ALONG AND THE RIVER WENT DOWN BETWEEN ITS BANKS AGAIN
 JUST THEN THE NIGGER WOMAN STEPS ON TO THE PASSAGE AND SAYS
 THAT'S THE KIND OF A BUG HENRY WAS
AND I MADE UP MY MIND THAT IT WOULD BE A LONG DAY BEFORE THEY EVER SEE ME AND JIM AGAIN
THEN THEY GO TO THE WAR
BUT HE WAS SLEEPING AND SLEEPING VERY PEACEFUL TOO
 THE KING SAYS
 THE KING SAYS
 AT LAST HE SAYS
 AT LAST HE SAYS
NO YOU WON'T SHE SAYS
 WHERE THE LOG FORKED I COULD PEEP THROUGH
 SHE SAID THAT WAS FIRST-RATE AND SHE RECKONED I WOULD HIVE THE NEXT ONE
I TOOK THE BUCKET AND GOURD
 ALL THROUGH DINNER JIM STOOD AROUND AND WAITED ON HIM AND SAYS WILL YO GRACE HAVE SOME O DIS OR SOME O DAT AND SO ON AND A BODY COULD SEE IT WAS MIGHTY PLEASING TO HIM
BUT I NEVER SAID SO
AND I GOT TO STEAL IT SOME WAY THAT THEY WON'T SUSPICION THAT I DONE IT
BUT THERE AIN'T ONLY JUST THE ONE WAY
AND THAT'S EVERY BIT AND GRAIN I DID SAY
 IT SAID HE RUN AWAY FROM ST JACQUES PLANTATION FORTY MILE BELOW NEW ORLEANS LAST WINTER AND LIKELY WENT NORTH AND WHOEVER WOULD CATCH HIM AND SEND HIM BACK HE COULD HAVE THE REWARD AND EXPENSES
HOLD ON HOLD ON
NICHOLS'S PLACE IS DOWN A MATTER OF THREE MILE MORE
 WE HAD ALL BOUGHT STORE CLOTHES WHERE WE STOPPED LAST
 WELL IT WAS PAP SURE ENOUGHAND SOBER TOO BY THE WAY HE LAID HIS OARS
 I ONLY WANT YOU TO TRYYOU NEEDN'T KEEP IT UP IF IT DON'T WORK BUT DE TROUBLE ALL DONE EF DE SNAKE BITE ME WHILE I'S A TRYIN HIM
WHY THEY SAID HE COULDN'T BE SOLD TILL HE'D BEEN IN THE STATE SIX MONTHS AND HE HADN'T BEEN THERE THAT LONG YET
SAID SHE WOULDN'T SAY IT FOR THE WHOLE WORLD
JIM SAID IT WAS A SIGN IT WAS GOING TO RAIN
THIS IS A SURPRISE TO ME WHICH I WASN'T LOOKING FOR
 BUT THE OTHERS SAID DON'T DO IT IT WOULDN'T ANSWER AT ALL
 HE WOULDN'T EVER DARED TO TALK SUCH TALK IN HIS LIFE BEFORE
 KILLED A NIGGER WELL IT'S LUCKY
 WELL IT WAS A GOOD LONG JOB BUT I WAS GETTING TOWARDS THE END OF IT WHEN I HEARD PAP'S GUN IN THE WOODS
NOW THE THING TO STUDY OUT IS HOW TO GET THE THINGS TO JIM TAKE THEM IN THROUGH THE HOLE I SAYS WHEN WE GET IT DONE HE ONLY JUST LOOKED SCORNFUL AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT NOBODY EVER HEARD OF SUCH AN IDIOTIC IDEA AND THEN HE WENT TO STUDYING
 THE RIVER LOOKED MILES AND MILES ACROSS
 ONE UV EM'S LIGHT EN T'OTHER ONE IS DARK
 RUN ALONG AND SMOUCH THE KNIVESTHREE OF THEM  SO I DONE IT
I GOT HURT A LITTLE EN COULDN'T SWIM FAS SO I WUZ A CONSIDABLE WAYS BEHINE YOU TOWARDS DE LAS
 YOU'LL TAKE ITWON'T YOU HE SAYS
 THEN WE HELPED HIM FIX HIS CHAIN BACK ON THE BED-LEG AND WAS READY FOR BED OURSELVES
 ALL SAFE
SO I RECK'N'D AT BY FO IN DE MAWNIN I'D BE TWENTY-FIVE MILE DOWN DE RIVER EN DEN I'D SLIP IN JIS B'FO DAYLIGHT EN SWIM ASHO EN TAKE TO DE WOODS ON DE ILLINOIS SIDE
OH PLEASE DON'T BOYS
AND I SAYS TO MYSELF TOM SAWYER WOULDN'T BACK OUT NOW AND SO I WON'T EITHER
 MARCH OFF LIKE A PASSEL OF FOOLS AND LEAVE EIGHT OR NINE THOUS'N DOLLARS WORTH O PROPERTY LAYIN AROUND JEST SUFFERIN TO BE SCOOPED IN?AND ALL GOOD SALABLE STUFF TOO THE DUKE HE GRUMBLED
TO BE OR NOT TO BE
AFTER BREAKFAST I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE DEAD MAN AND GUESS OUT HOW HE COME TO BE KILLED BUT JIM DIDN'T WANT TO
AND BY AND BY THE STORM LET UP FOR GOOD AND ALL
SLOW NAVIGATION.BORROWING THINGS.BOARDING THE WRECK.THE PLOTTERS.HUNTING FOR THE BOAT
WE DIDN'T TOUCH AN OAR AND WE DIDN'T SPEAK NOR WHISPER NOR HARDLY EVEN BREATHE
CHAPTER V
CHAPTER V
 BUCK AND A DOG WAS STRETCHED OUT ON THE GRASS IN THE SUN SOUND ASLEEP
I DON'T GET NO SHOW NEVER MIND BUCK MY BOY SAYS THE OLD MAN YOU'LL HAVE SHOW ENOUGH ALL IN GOOD TIME DON'T YOU FRET ABOUT THAT
THAT IS THE IDEA
THIS TIME HE SAID THE HAIR-BALL WAS ALL RIGHT
 THE DUKE SAYS
 THE DUKE SAYS
 HE SAID THEY'D GOT ACROSS THE RIVER AND WAS SAFE
EN DAT CREASE DE RACKET
SO THEN I WENT TO HIS ROOM AND BEGUN TO PAW AROUND THERE
SO THE KING HE BLATTERED ALONG AND MANAGED TO INQUIRE ABOUT PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY AND DOG IN TOWN BY HIS NAME AND MENTIONED ALL SORTS OF LITTLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED ONE TIME OR ANOTHER IN THE TOWN OR TO GEORGE'S FAMILY OR TO PETER
 I WAS TOO SMALL WHEN PAP USED TO HAVE EM AT THE PALACE
BANG
BANG
 SHE STOPPED WITH HER MOUTH OPEN AND HER HANDS UP
YOU GOING TO ORLEANS YOU SAY YES BUT THAT AIN'T ONLY A PART OF IT
 ALL OF A SUDDEN HE HEAVES ALL THE TEA IN BOSTON HARBOR OVERBOARD AND WHACKS OUT A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND DARES THEM TO COME ON
HOUND ASLEEP THERE IN THE SUN
PUT IT ON THE FLOOR BEHIND THE FRONT DOOR
 NEITHER DID THAT OTHER FELLOW
SAID IT WAS JUST EXACTLY THE WAY IT ALL HAPPENED
IT WAS LIKE SPIRITS CARRYING ON THAT WAY IN THE AIR
 I WENT ALONG SLOW THEN AND I WARN'T RIGHT DOWN CERTAIN WHETHER I WAS GLAD I STARTED OR WHETHER I WARN'T
 SO HE DIDN'T PRY INTO MY POCKETS BUT ONLY FELT OUTSIDE WITH HIS HANDS AND SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT
HE'S HERE IN OUR HOUSE AND A STRANGER AND IT WASN'T GOOD OF YOU TO SAY IT
YOU'VE GOT TIME TO CROWD THROUGH THE BRUSH AND GET UP THE CRICK A LITTLE WAYS
 THEY TACKLED MISSIONARYING AND MESMERIZING AND DOCTORING AND TELLING FORTUNES AND A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING
SO HE WAS SATISFIED AND SAID HE WOULD DO IT ALL JUST AS TOM SAID
WELL MARY JANE SHE LIT OUT THE BACK WAY I RECKON
I CLIPPED ALONG AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I BOUNDED RIGHT ON TO THE ASHES OF A CAMP FIRE THAT WAS STILL SMOKING
 I WISHED I HADN'T EVER COME ASHORE THAT NIGHT TO SEE SUCH THINGS
 AND FOR A STARTER I WOULD GO TO WORK AND STEAL JIM OUT OF SLAVERY AGAIN
 ONE BILL SAID THE CELEBRATED DR ARMAND DE MONTALBAN OF PARIS WOULD LECTURE ON THE SCIENCE OF PHRENOLOGY AT SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE ON THE BLANK DAY OF BLANK AT TEN CENTS ADMISSION AND FURNISH CHARTS OF CHARACTER AT TWENTY-FIVE CENTS APIECE  THE DUKE SAID THAT WAS HIM
 IF YOU SEE ANY RUNAWAY NIGGERS YOU GET HELP AND NAB THEM AND YOU CAN MAKE SOME MONEY BY IT GOOD-BYE SIR SAYS I
 IT WAS MY WATCH BELOW TILL TWELVE BUT I WOULDN'T A TURNED IN ANYWAY IF I'D HAD A BED BECAUSE A BODY DON'T SEE SUCH A STORM AS THAT EVERY DAY IN THE WEEK NOT BY A LONG SIGHT
 WHAT WAS IT WHY IT'S BECAUSE YOU AIN'T ONE OF THESE LEATHER-FACE PEOPLE
SO WE PUT THE SHEET BACK ON THE LINE THAT NIGHT AND STOLE ONE OUT OF HER CLOSET
AND JIM ALLOWED THE INSCRIPTION WAS GOING TO BE THE TOUGHEST OF ALL
BUT THE OLD MAN GOT PRETTY SILENT BY AND BYDIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY AND DIDN'T LOOK PRETTY COMFORTABLE OVER ALL THAT PETTING THAT WAS GOING ON AROUND THAT DUKE
 ANSWER UP SQUARE NOW AND IT'LL BE THE BETTER FOR YOU I WILL SIR I WILL HONESTBUT DON'T LEAVE US PLEASE
I WOULD THOU COULDST
 I FELT SO ORNERY AND LOW DOWN AND MEAN THAT I SAYS TO MYSELF MY MIND'S MADE UP
THE KING HE VISITED AROUND IN THE EVENING AND SWEETENED EVERYBODY UP AND MADE HIMSELF EVER SO FRIENDLY
 I WAS LETTING ON TO GIVE UP SIN BUT AWAY INSIDE OF ME I WAS HOLDING ON TO THE BIGGEST ONE OF ALL
AND THAT NIGHT THE HOUSE WAS JAM FULL OF MEN IN NO TIME
 WHY THEY'VE STOLE EVERYTHING THEY COULD LAY THEIR HANDS ONAND WE A-WATCHING ALL THE TIME MIND YOU
 AND HE SAID IF A MAN OWNED A BEEHIVE AND THAT MAN DIED THE BEES MUST BE TOLD ABOUT IT BEFORE SUN-UP NEXT MORNING OR ELSE THE BEES WOULD ALL WEAKEN DOWN AND QUIT WORK AND DIE
WELL AS I WAS SAYING ABOUT THE PARLOR THERE WAS BEAUTIFUL CURTAINS ON THE WINDOWS
AND IF EVER I'D A THOUGHT IT WOULD DO ANY GOOD FOR ME TO PRAY FOR HER BLAMED IF I WOULDN'T A DONE IT OR BUST
 NEXT I NOTICED THAT BUCK WAS UP AND GONE
AND WHEN THEY COME THEY'LL BRING THEIR MASKS AND FETCH A MAN ALONG
 IF A DOOR BANGED AUNT SALLY SHE JUMPED AND SAID OUCH IF ANYTHING FELL SHE JUMPED AND SAID OUCH IF YOU HAPPENED TO TOUCH HER WHEN SHE WARN'T NOTICING SHE DONE THE SAME
BUT WHAT HE HAD BEEN SAYING GIVE ME THE VERY IDEA I WANTED
 THEN MISS WATSON SHE TOOK ME IN THE CLOSET AND PRAYED BUT NOTHING COME OF IT
SAID IF WE WAS A MIND TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM THAT WOULD DO HIM MORE GOOD THAN MOST ANYTHING ELSE
 DIRECTLY I COULD JUST BARELY HEAR A ME-YOW
 I HEARD PEOPLE TALKING AT THE FERRY LANDING
 SO I SET THERE AND WATCHED THE CANNON-SMOKE AND LISTENED TO THE BOOM
 WELL FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO WE HAD CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE BECAUSE PEOPLE WAS ALWAYS COMING OUT IN SKIFFS AND TRYING TO TAKE JIM AWAY FROM ME SAYING THEY BELIEVED HE WAS A RUNAWAY NIGGER
 I DIDN'T NEED ANYBODY TO TELL ME THAT THAT WAS AN AWFUL BAD SIGN AND WOULD FETCH ME SOME BAD LUCK SO I WAS SCARED AND MOST SHOOK THE CLOTHES OFF OF ME
NO WE DIDN'T
 DE COW UP N DIED ON MY HAN'S SO YOU LOST THE TEN DOLLARS NO I DIDN'T LOSE IT ALL
 OF COURSE
 IF I WAS TO CATCH A NIGGER THAT WAS UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO RUN AWAY I WOULDN'T GIVE HIM UP I'D HANG HIM  AND WHILST THE NIGGER STEPPED TO THE DOOR TO LOOK AT THE DIME AND BITE IT TO SEE IF IT WAS GOOD HE WHISPERS TO JIM AND SAYS
 THERE WAS FRECKLED PLACES ON THE GROUND WHERE THE LIGHT SIFTED DOWN THROUGH THE LEAVES AND THE FRECKLED PLACES SWAPPED ABOUT A LITTLE SHOWING THERE WAS A LITTLE BREEZE UP THERE
NEVER SAID NOTHING
IT WAS A CANOE AND WARN'T FASTENED WITH NOTHING BUT A ROPE
 ON THE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WAS A KIND OF A LOVELY CROCKERY BASKET THAT HAD APPLES AND ORANGES AND PEACHES AND GRAPES PILED UP IN IT WHICH WAS MUCH REDDER AND YELLOWER AND PRETTIER THAN REAL ONES IS BUT THEY WARN'T REAL BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE WHERE PIECES HAD GOT CHIPPED OFF AND SHOWED THE WHITE CHALK OR WHATEVER IT WAS UNDERNEATH
 YOU KNOW THAT
I WAS SORRY TO HEAR JIM SAY THAT IT WAS SUCH A LOWERING OF HIM
SHE WAS THE BEST GIRL I EVER SEE AND HAD THE MOST SAND
 NO HIGH GROUND ABOUT CAIRO JIM SAID
NIGHTS THEY DON'T BOTHER US THE DUKE SAYS
 AND WHEN YOU TELL HIM THE HANDBILL AND THE REWARD'S BOGUS MAYBE HE'LL BELIEVE YOU WHEN YOU EXPLAIN TO HIM WHAT THE IDEA WAS FOR GETTING EM OUT
THE FENCES WAS MADE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF BOARDS NAILED ON AT DIFFERENT TIMES
BUT UNCLE SILAS HE HAD A NOBLE BRASS WARMING-PAN WHICH HE THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE OF BECAUSE IT BELONGED TO ONE OF HIS ANCESTERS WITH A LONG WOODEN HANDLE THAT COME OVER FROM ENGLAND WITH WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR IN THE MAYFLOWER OR ONE OF THEM EARLY SHIPS AND WAS HID AWAY UP GARRET WITH A LOT OF OTHER OLD POTS AND THINGS THAT WAS VALUABLE NOT ON ACCOUNT OF BEING ANY ACCOUNT BECAUSE THEY WARN'T BUT ON ACCOUNT OF THEM BEING RELICTS YOU KNOW AND WE SNAKED HER OUT PRIVATE AND TOOK HER DOWN THERE BUT SHE FAILED ON THE FIRST PIES BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW BUT SHE COME UP SMILING ON THE LAST ONE
 THEY HADN'T STIRRED
IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER YOU DO RIGHT OR WRONG A PERSON'S CONSCIENCE AIN'T GOT NO SENSE AND JUST GOES FOR HIM ANYWAY
 THE LID WAS SHOVED ALONG ABOUT A FOOT SHOWING THE DEAD MAN'S FACE DOWN IN THERE WITH A WET CLOTH OVER IT AND HIS SHROUD ON
THEN SHE PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF AND I SEE SHE BEGUN TO CRY THOUGH I COULDN'T HEAR HER AND HER BACK WAS TO ME
HOW'D YOU SAY HE GOT SHOT HE HAD A DREAM I SAYS AND IT SHOT HIM SINGULAR DREAM HE SAYS
AND IN A HALF SECOND I WAS IN THE BOAT AND JIM COME TUMBLING AFTER ME
SO I AIN'T HUNGRY NO MORE
HE WAS BAREFOOTED AND THE SNAKE BIT HIM RIGHT ON THE HEEL
 YOU'D A BEN DOWN DAH IN DE WOODS WIDOUT ANY DINNER EN GITTN MOS DROWNDED TOO
 BY AND BY A PROUD-LOOKING MAN ABOUT FIFTY-FIVEAND HE WAS A HEAP THE BEST DRESSED MAN IN THAT TOWN TOOSTEPS OUT OF THE STORE AND THE CROWD DROPS BACK ON EACH SIDE TO LET HIM COME
 WE TOOK AND LINED HER WITH DOUGH AND SET HER IN THE COALS AND LOADED HER UP WITH RAG ROPE AND PUT ON A DOUGH ROOF AND SHUT DOWN THE LID AND PUT HOT EMBERS ON TOP AND STOOD OFF FIVE FOOT WITH THE LONG HANDLE COOL AND COMFORTABLE AND IN FIFTEEN MINUTES SHE TURNED OUT A PIE THAT WAS A SATISFACTION TO LOOK AT
THEY GENERLY HAD ON YELLOW STRAW HATS MOST AS WIDE AS AN UMBRELLA BUT DIDN'T WEAR NO COATS NOR WAISTCOATS THEY CALLED ONE ANOTHER BILL AND BUCK AND HANK AND JOE AND ANDY AND TALKED LAZY AND DRAWLY AND USED CONSIDERABLE MANY CUSS WORDS
 SPEAK BILGEWATER I AM THE LATE DAUPHIN YOU BET YOU JIM AND ME STARED THIS TIME
I SLIPPED UP TO BED FEELING RUTHER BLUE ON ACCOUNTS OF THE THING PLAYING OUT THAT WAY AFTER I HAD TOOK SO MUCH TROUBLE AND RUN SO MUCH RESK ABOUT IT
HE HAD A BLANKET AROUND HIS HEAD AND HIS HEAD WAS NEARLY IN THE FIRE
 I AIN'T OPPOSED TO SPENDING MONEY ON CIRCUSES WHEN THERE AIN'T NO OTHER WAY BUT THERE AIN'T NO USE IN WASTING IT ON THEM
AND PRETTY SOON WHEN ONE OF THEM SAYS I'M FOR GOING AND GETTING IN THE CABIN FIRST AND RIGHT NOW AND CATCHING THEM WHEN THEY COME I MOST DROPPED
 THEN WE'LL ALL BE IN THE SAME BOAT
AND WHEN THE ISLAND HAD BEEN OVERFLOWED A DAY OR TWO THEY GOT SO TAME ON ACCOUNT OF BEING HUNGRY THAT YOU COULD PADDLE RIGHT UP AND PUT YOUR HAND ON THEM IF YOU WANTED TO
THERE WARN'T NO CASE OF A STATE PRISONER NOT SCRABBLING HIS INSCRIPTION TO LEAVE BEHIND AND HIS COAT OF ARMS
 SO THE LONGER I WENT TO SCHOOL THE EASIER IT GOT TO BE
 I KNOWED WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
 SOMEBODY SINGS OUT
 HE NEVER SAID NOTHING
AND WHAT'S MORE I'LL HELP YOU
WISHT I WAS A-GOING
 I BORROWED THREE DOLLARS FROM JUDGE THATCHER AND PAP TOOK IT AND GOT DRUNK AND WENT A-BLOWING AROUND AND CUSSING AND WHOOPING AND CARRYING ON

WELL I SEEMED TO BE IN THE OPEN RIVER AGAIN BY AND BY BUT I COULDN'T HEAR NO SIGN OF A WHOOP NOWHERES
 BECAUSE YOU'RE BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAR AND FEATHER POOR FRIENDLESS CAST-OUT WOMEN THAT COME ALONG HERE DID THAT MAKE YOU THINK YOU HAD GRIT ENOUGH TO LAY YOUR HANDS ON A MAN
I DON'T WANT TO JAKE PACKARD
BUT IT CAN'T TAKE THAT
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN HE WOULD HOLD UP HIS BIBLE AND SPREAD IT OPEN AND KIND OF PASS IT AROUND THIS WAY AND THAT SHOUTING IT'S THE BRAZEN SERPENT IN THE WILDERNESS
WHEN DID HE SING OUT
THEN WHILST THEY ARE GETTING HIS CHAINS LOOSE YOU SLIP THERE AND LOCK THEM IN AND CAN KILL THEM AT YOUR LEASURE
MR LOTHROP'S
IT WON'T DO TO FOOL WITH SMALL-POX DON'T YOU SEE HOLD ON PARKER SAYS THE OTHER MAN HERE'S A TWENTY TO PUT ON THE BOARD FOR ME
THEN THEY COME OUT AND LOCKED HIM UP
AND YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH THAT TOOTH WITHOUT FETCHING THE WHOLE HARROW ALONG CAN YOU
 WE WAS DRIFTING STRAIGHT DOWN FOR HER
SOME ER DE NIGGERS FOUN HER KETCHED ON A SNAG ALONG HEAH IN DE BEN EN DEY HID HER IN A CRICK MONGST DE WILLOWS EN DEY WUZ SO MUCH JAWIN BOUT WHICH UN UM SHE B'LONG TO DE MOS DAT I COME TO HEAH BOUT IT POOTY SOON SO I UPS EN SETTLES DE TROUBLE BY TELLIN UM SHE DON'T B'LONG TO NONE UV UM BUT TO YOU EN ME

HE TURNS ON ME LOOKING PITYING ENOUGH TO MAKE A BODY CRY AND SAYS
AH IT'S SUBLIME SUBLIME
 AND I BELIEVED THEY WAS SORRY AND SO DID YOU AND SO DID EVERYBODY
 JIM SINGS OUT
AND YOU SEE THE MIST CURL UP OFF OF THE WATER AND THE EAST REDDENS UP AND THE RIVER AND YOU MAKE OUT A LOG-CABIN IN THE EDGE OF THE WOODS AWAY ON THE BANK ON T'OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER BEING A WOODYARD LIKELY AND PILED BY THEM CHEATS SO YOU CAN THROW A DOG THROUGH IT ANYWHERES
 HERE MARY JANE SUSAN JOANNER TAKE THE MONEYTAKE IT ALL
 G'LONG TO BED AND DON'T YOU DEFFERSIT ME NO MORE DEFFERSITS LONG S YOU LIVE SO THE KING SNEAKED INTO THE WIGWAM AND TOOK TO HIS BOTTLE FOR COMFORT AND BEFORE LONG THE DUKE TACKLED HIS BOTTLE
IT'S A CONSIDERABLE WAYS TO THE UPPER END OF THE TOWN
HAVE IT FOR BREAKFAST HAVE IT FOR BREAKFAST
 MUST A BEN A RAFT UV M AT IT RIGHT ALONG ALL THE TIME AMOST
YOU'VE BEEN TREATED BAD AND YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND TO CUT
 SO I WENT AND GOT THE BAG OF MEAL AND MY OLD SAW OUT OF THE CANOE AND FETCHED THEM TO THE HOUSE
AND JIM DON'T EITHER I RECKON
AND SUCH-LIKE TIMES
BUT IF THERE WAS A BOAT AROUND I COULDN'T SEE IT FOR STARS AND SHADOWS AIN'T GOOD TO SEE BY
HE MIGHT WAKE AND MAKE A DISTURBANCE AND THEN THEY'D FIND OUT I WARN'T IN
 HE SAID
BUT THAT'S THE COMMON SORT AND WOMEN
MISTER IS THAT TOWN CAIRO CAIRO
OH DANG IT NOW DON'T TAKE ON SO
 THEY TOLD ME TO
I KEPT QUIET WITH MY EARS COCKED ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES I RECKON
 A RAIL FENCE ROUND A TWO-ACRE YARD
 BUT BY AND BY SURE ENOUGH I CATCHED A GLIMPSE OF FIRE AWAY THROUGH THE TREES
 THEY COULDN'T A BEEN WORSE SCARED IF THE PLACE HAD A BEEN FULL OF GHOSTS LAYING FOR THEM BEHIND EVERYTHING AND UNDER THE BEDS AND SHIVERING THROUGH THE AIR
WE HAD NO END OF TROUBLE WITH THAT PIE
 GOSHEN'S TEN MILE FURTHER UP THE RIVER
 HE HAD A GUN WHICH HE HAD STOLE I RECKON AND WE FISHED AND HUNTED AND THAT WAS WHAT WE LIVED ON
BUT I SAYS TO MYSELF THERE'S MY TWO POOR BOYS ASLEEP WAY UP STAIRS IN THAT LONESOME ROOM AND I DECLARE TO GOODNESS I WAS THAT UNEASY T I CREP UP THERE AND LOCKED EM IN
 IF THE PROFITS HAS TURNED OUT TO BE NONE LACKIN CONSIDABLE AND NONE TO CARRY IS IT MY FAULT ANY MORE'N IT'S YOURN WELL THEY'D BE IN THIS HOUSE YET AND WE WOULDN'T IF I COULD A GOT MY ADVICE LISTENED TO THE KING SASSED BACK AS MUCH AS WAS SAFE FOR HIM AND THEN SWAPPED AROUND AND LIT INTO ME AGAIN
WHEN I GOT TO IT JIM WAS SETTING THERE WITH HIS HEAD DOWN BETWEEN HIS KNEES ASLEEP WITH HIS RIGHT ARM HANGING OVER THE STEERING-OAR
 WHICH WAS ALL RIGHT AND WORKED FIRST-RATE
AND WON'T STAY AWAY FROM YOU A MINUTE
IF WE GET TIME THE NIGHT OF THE ESCAPE WE'LL DIG ONE I SAYS
 YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO ME IF YOU CAN!_ANY OF YOU WELL IT DOES BEAT LAWS ALIVE I NEVER SO HELP ME I WOULDN'T A BE HOUSE_-THIEVES AS WELL AS GOODNESSGRACIOUSSAKES I'D A BEN AFEARD TO LIVE IN SICH A FRAID TO LIVE_!WHY I WAS THAT SCARED I DASN'T HARDLY GO TO BED OR GET UP OR LAY DOWN OR SET DOWN SISTER RIDGEWAY
THEN ONE OF THEM GOT ON ONE SIDE OF THE COFFIN AND T'OTHER ON T'OTHER SIDE AND THEY KNEELED DOWN AND RESTED THEIR FOREHEADS ON THE COFFIN AND LET ON TO PRAY ALL TO THEMSELVES
 WHERE WOULD IT BE WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN THANK GOODNESS SAYS I KIND OF TIMID-LIKE
SO SHE SAYS VERY DECIDED
HANG THE TROUBLESOME RUBBAGE THER'S TEN NOW AND SHE LOOKED HUFFY AND BOTHERED BOTH
AND I'VE PEGGED ALONG EVER SINCE DRY AS A POWDER-HORN
 I FORGOT I WAS THE OLD MAN'S SERVANT
BUT HE REALLY DONE IT PRETTY GOOD
 IT WAS A LITTLE TWENTY-FOOT YARD
BUT THEY COULDN'T COME IT
 SOMETIMES HE SPEC HE'LL GO WAY EN DEN AGIN HE SPEC HE'LL STAY
 OLD HANK BUNKER DONE IT ONCE AND BRAGGED ABOUT IT
EVERY NIGHT NOW I USED TO SLIP ASHORE TOWARDS TEN O'CLOCK AT SOME LITTLE VILLAGE AND BUY TEN OR FIFTEEN CENTS WORTH OF MEAL OR BACON OR OTHER STUFF TO EAT
SO HE WAS FOR CRAWLING OUT AND SETTING THE RAFT LOOSE HIMSELF
I COULDN'T STAND IT
IT ALL BELONGED TO ME SO TO SAY AND I WANTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
 "TAKE A CHEER I DONE IT
 SO WE SET IN LIKE WE DONE BEFORE WITH THE DUKE AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM
 HIS PEW'S RIGHT OVER OPPOSITE OURNON T'OTHER SIDE THE PULPIT I THOUGHT HE LIVED IN LONDON WELL HE DOES
 SARAH MARY WILLIAMS
 BUCK AND HIS MA AND ALL OF THEM SMOKED COB PIPES EXCEPT THE NIGGER WOMAN WHICH WAS GONE AND THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN
AND THE NEXT SECOND HALF OF THEM COME BACK WAGGING THEIR TAILS AROUND ME AND MAKING FRIENDS WITH ME
 THEY CAN TURN IT INTO A PICNIC IF THEY WANT TOTHEY BROUGHT PLENTY PROVISIONS THEM RAPSCALLIONS TOOK IN FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY-FIVE DOLLARS IN THAT THREE NIGHTS
 HE CHASED ME ROUND AND ROUND THE PLACE WITH A CLASP-KNIFE CALLING ME THE ANGEL OF DEATH AND SAYING HE WOULD KILL ME AND THEN I COULDN'T COME FOR HIM NO MORE
AND BY AND BY THEY FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU AND NEVER WANT TO GO HOME ANY MORE WELL IF THAT'S THE WAY I'M AGREED BUT I DON'T TAKE NO STOCK IN IT
 BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO
 I SKIMMED AROUND FOR THE WATCHMAN A-WONDERING WHEREABOUTS HE SLEPT
AND ALL THE TIME HOW THE WOMAN DID DANCE AROUND AND LAUGH AND CRY
 I WAS FLOATING ALONG OF COURSE FOUR OR FIVE MILES AN HOUR
 SO THEN I TOOK THE BEARINGS OF A WOODY ISLAND THAT WAS DOWN THE RIVER A PIECE AND AS SOON AS IT WAS FAIRLY DARK I CREPT OUT WITH MY RAFT AND WENT FOR IT AND HID IT THERE AND THEN TURNED IN
AND ALL IN THE SAME SECOND WE SEEM TO HEAR LOW VOICES IN YONDER
 I WAS STUCK
 THERE AIN'T NO HURRY
 I RECK'N I KNOWS SENSE WHEN I SEES IT
COME ALONG NOW
BESIDES YOU KNOW YOU'LL BE IN COSTUME AND THAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD
NOW SAYS THE DUKE AFTER TO-NIGHT WE CAN RUN IN THE DAYTIME IF WE WANT TO
WHEN I FIRST SEE YOU I SAYS TO MYSELF IT'S MR WILKS SURE AND HE COME MIGHTY NEAR GETTING HERE IN TIME  BUT THEN I SAYS AGAIN NO I RECKON IT AIN'T HIM OR ELSE HE WOULDN'T BE PADDLING UP THE RIVER  YOU AIN'T HIM ARE YOU NO MY NAME'S BLODGETTELEXANDER BLODGETT_REVEREND ELEXANDER BLODGETT I S'POSE I MUST SAY AS I'M ONE O THE LORD'S POOR SERVANTS
MIGHTY FEWAN DEY AIN'T NO USE TO A BODY
I DON'T THINK WE PUT THAT MONEY IN A GOOD PLACE THAT CHEERED ME UP
 IN THE NORTH HE LETS ANYBODY WALK OVER HIM THAT WANTS TO AND GOES HOME AND PRAYS FOR A HUMBLE SPIRIT TO BEAR IT
BECAUSE AS SOON S IT'S FOUND OUT AT WE DIDN'T OWN ITWHICH WON'T BE LONG AFTER WE'VE SLIDTHE SALE WON'T BE VALID AND IT LL ALL GO BACK TO THE ESTATE
AND HERE YOU'RE A-SWELLING YOURSELF UP LIKE THIS
 BUT WHAT DID BECOME OF THE RAFT THEN?AND JIMPOOR JIM BLAMED IF I KNOWTHAT IS WHAT'S BECOME OF THE RAFT
TAIN'T RIGHT AND TAIN'T FAIR FOR YOU TO STAY THAR ALL THE TIME AND NEVER GIVE NOBODY A CHANCE
THROW HIM OUT AND ONE OR TWO WOMEN BEGUN TO SCREAM
SO HE TOOK IT AND PRIZED OUT ONE OF THE STAPLES
 AS FOR HIS CLOTHESJUST RAGS THAT WAS ALL
BUT HE SHUT ME UP AND SAYS
DE WHITE ONE GITS HIM TO GO RIGHT A LITTLE WHILE DEN DE BLACK ONE SAIL IN EN BUST IT ALL UP
AND SO TAKE IT ALL AROUND WE MADE A GOOD HAUL
I TOOK A GOOD GAP AND A STRETCH AND WAS JUST GOING TO UNHITCH AND START WHEN I HEARD A SOUND AWAY OVER THE WATER
 I SAYS TO MYSELF I RECKON A BODY THAT UPS AND TELLS THE TRUTH WHEN HE IS IN A TIGHT PLACE IS TAKING CONSIDERABLE MANY RESKS THOUGH I AIN'T HAD NO EXPERIENCE AND CAN'T SAY FOR CERTAIN
THE STORES AND HOUSES WAS MOST ALL OLD SHACKLY DRIED-UP FRAME CONCERNS THAT HADN'T EVER BEEN PAINTED
THE HORSES IS ABOUT BEAT OUT
 OLD MISS WATSON DIED TWO MONTHS AGO AND SHE WAS ASHAMED SHE EVER WAS GOING TO SELL HIM DOWN THE RIVER AND SAID SO
 IS SHE TOOK BAD IT AIN'T NO NAME FOR IT
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS A POWER OF MONEY
 BUT BILL SAYS
 A HAREM'S A BO'D'N-HOUSE I RECK'N
AND I WAS GLAD IT WAS ACCORDING TO MY JUDGMENT OF HIM TOO
 ONE OF THE MEN STUCK HIS HEAD OUT ONLY ABOUT A COUPLE OF FOOT FROM ME AND I THOUGHT I WAS GONE
 IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD RAISETWENTY DOLLARS APIECE
WELL SAYS I YOU DONE IT BUT I DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD
 AND THEY'RE JUST THE SAME AS THEY WAS WHEN I GOT THEM OUT OF THE OFFICE
NOW YOU HEAR ME
I NEVER KNOWED IT BEFORE
WELL DEY'LL BE PLENTY UN M DAH I RECK'N EN YOU BET YOU HE'LL FETCH ONE EF HE GITS A CHANST I TOOK UP THE RIVER ROAD AS HARD AS I COULD PUT
MY NEW CLOTHES WAS ALL GREASED UP AND CLAYEY AND I WAS DOG-TIRED
AND WENT WEAVING FIRST TO ONE SIDE OF THE PLATFORM AND THEN THE OTHER AND THEN A-LEANING DOWN OVER THE FRONT OF IT WITH HIS ARMS AND HIS BODY GOING ALL THE TIME AND SHOUTING HIS WORDS OUT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
COME WITH A CONTRITE HEART
QUICKHURRY
 SO WE BUILT IT THERE AND COOKED DINNER
 THEN TOM AND BOB WENT TO THE SIDEBOARD WHERE THE DECANTER WAS AND MIXED A GLASS OF BITTERS AND HANDED IT TO HIM AND HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND AND WAITED TILL TOM'S AND BOB'S WAS MIXED AND THEN THEY BOWED AND SAID OUR DUTY TO YOU SIR AND MADAM AND THEY BOWED THE LEAST BIT IN THE WORLD AND SAID THANK YOU AND SO THEY DRANK ALL THREE AND BOB AND TOM POURED A SPOONFUL OF WATER ON THE SUGAR AND THE MITE OF WHISKY OR APPLE BRANDY IN THE BOTTOM OF THEIR TUMBLERS AND GIVE IT TO ME AND BUCK AND WE DRANK TO THE OLD PEOPLE TOO
 "IF HE COULD USE HIS RIGHT HAND YOU WOULD SEE THAT HE WROTE HIS OWN LETTERS AND MINE TOO
THERE WAS A CLOCK ON THE MIDDLE OF THE MANTELPIECE WITH A PICTURE OF A TOWN PAINTED ON THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE GLASS FRONT AND A ROUND PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT FOR THE SUN AND YOU COULD SEE THE PENDULUM SWINGING BEHIND IT
 AND THE THIRD TIME I WAKED UP AT DAWN AND SLID DOWN AND SHE WAS THERE YET AND HER CANDLE WAS MOST OUT AND HER OLD GRAY HEAD WAS RESTING ON HER HAND AND SHE WAS ASLEEP
 AND HUNGRY?OH NO I RECKON NOT
GRANGERFORD YOUNG HARNEY SHEPHERDSON MISS CHARLOTTE AND ASKED ME IF I LIKED HER BEHIND THE WOOD-PILE HIDING DAY-TIMES AND DOGS A-COMING BY RIGHTS I AM A DUKE I AM THE LATE DAUPHIN TAIL PIECE ON THE RAFT THE KING AS JULIET COURTING ON THE SLY A PIRATE FOR THIRTY YEARS ANOTHER LITTLE JOB PRACTIZING HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY GIMME A CHAW A LITTLE MONTHLY DRUNK THE DEATH OF BOGGS SHERBURN STEPS OUT A DEAD HEAD HE SHED SEVENTEEN SUITS TRAGEDY THEIR POCKETS BULGED HENRY THE EIGHTH IN BOSTON HARBOR HARMLESS ADOLPHUS HE FAIRLY EMPTIED THAT YOUNG FELLOW ALAS OUR POOR BROTHER YOU BET IT IS LEAKING MAKING UP THE DEFFISIT GOING FOR HIM THE DOCTOR THE BAG OF MONEY THE CUBBY SUPPER WITH THE HARE-LIP HONEST INJUN THE DUKE LOOKS UNDER THE BED HUCK TAKES THE MONEY A CRACK IN THE DINING-ROOM DOOR THE UNDERTAKER HE HAD A RAT WAS YOU IN MY ROOM JAWING IN TROUBLE INDIGNATION HOW TO FIND THEM HE WROTE HANNAH WITH THE MUMPS THE AUCTION THE TRUE BROTHERS THE DOCTOR LEADS HUCK THE DUKE
AND THE TEARS COME IN HER EYES AND RUN DOWN OVER
SOON AS I COULD GET BUCK DOWN BY THE CORN-CRIBS UNDER THE TREES BY OURSELVES I SAYS
 THE SECOND SON OF THE LATE DUKE SEIZED THE TITLES AND ESTATESTHE INFANT REAL DUKE WAS IGNORED
 YOU ALL HEARN ME
BUT THERE'S ONE THING TOM SAWYERIF WE GO TO TEARING UP OUR SHEETS TO MAKE JIM A ROPE LADDER WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO TROUBLE WITH AUNT SALLY JUST AS SURE AS YOU'RE BORN
AND NOBODY THAT DIDN'T BELONG TO THE BAND COULD USE THAT MARK AND IF HE DID HE MUST BE SUED
 JIM SAID THE MOON COULD A LAID THEM
 HE SAID HIS FATHER LAID MIGHTY SICK ONCE AND SOME OF THEM CATCHED A BIRD AND HIS OLD GRANNY SAID HIS FATHER WOULD DIE AND HE DID
BUT WE DIDN'T NEED IT
SAYS I TO MYSELF SOMETHING'S UP
 PRETTY SOON SHE SAYS WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS HONEY MMARY WILLIAMS SOMEHOW IT DIDN'T SEEM TO ME THAT I SAID IT WAS MARY BEFORE SO I DIDN'T LOOK UPSEEMED TO ME I SAID IT WAS SARAH
THAT'S MIGHTY GOOD!AND MIGHTY INGENIOUSUNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES SO HE LAUGHED AGAIN
BECAUSE WE ALLOWED WE'D TIRE THEM OUT OR THEY'D GOT TO TIRE US OUT AND THEY DONE IT
 AND BESIDES A BODY COULDN'T BREATHE AND HEAR SUCH TALK
FOR I WARN'T GOING TO LET JIM FIND OUT IT WAS ALL MY FAULT NOT IF I COULD HELP IT
AND JIM SAID SHE WAS A SMART ONE AND IF SHE WAS TO START AFTER US HERSELF SHE WOULDN'T SET DOWN AND WATCH A CAMP FIRENO SIR SHE'D FETCH A DOG
 I FELT A LITTLE BIT HEAVY-HEARTED ABOUT THE GANG BUT NOT MUCH FOR I RECKONED IF THEY COULD STAND IT I COULD
 THEN I THOUGHT A MINUTE AND SAYS TO MYSELF HOLD ON
 HE SAID THE FIRST TOWHEAD STOOD FOR A MAN THAT WOULD TRY TO DO US SOME GOOD BUT THE CURRENT WAS ANOTHER MAN THAT WOULD GET US AWAY FROM HIM
 THE RAIN POURED DOWN AND NEVER A LIGHT SHOWED
 WHAT KEP YOU?BOAT GET AGROUND YES'MSHE DON'T SAY YES'MSAY AUNT SALLY
AND KNOWING AND NOT IGNORANT
 WELL THINKS I THAT LOOKS POWERFUL BAD FOR TOM AND I'LL DIG OUT FOR THE ISLAND RIGHT OFF
BUT BY AND BY THE THING DRAGGED THROUGH AND EVERYTHING WAS SOLDEVERYTHING BUT A LITTLE OLD TRIFLING LOT IN THE GRAVEYARD
TO BE LEFT ALONE IN THE COLD WORLD SO WELL THEY COULD BE WORSE OFF
I HEARD ONE MAN SAY IT WAS NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK AND HE HOPED DAYLIGHT WOULDN'T WAIT MORE THAN ABOUT A WEEK LONGER
 SO DID JIM
AND IF A LITTLE GLIMPSE OF A SNAG SLIPS BY YOU DON'T THINK TO YOURSELF HOW FAST YOU'RE GOING BUT YOU CATCH YOUR BREATH AND THINK MY
 DO YOU LIKE TO COMB UP SUNDAYS AND ALL THAT KIND OF FOOLISHNESS
 THEN IT BEGUN TO ITCH ON THE INSIDE
 THE BEST WAY'S TO LET IT GO AND KEEP STILL ABOUT IT
 DESE LAS SKIFTS WUZ FULL O LADIES EN GENLMEN A-GOIN OVER FOR TO SEE DE PLACE
ALL DEAD STILL
 AFTER EM BOYS AND TURN LOOSE THE DOGS SO HERE THEY COME FULL TILT
 I SLUNK ALONG ANOTHER PIECE FURTHER THEN LISTENED AGAIN
 THIS AIN'T GOSHEN
BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT BUT FIFTEEN MINUTES TO CARRY THE NONNAMOUS LETTER AND SHOVE IT UNDER THE FRONT DOOR ALL RIGHT THEN I'LL DO IT
 IT TOOK AWAY ALL THE UNCOMFORTABLENESS AND WE FELT MIGHTY GOOD OVER IT BECAUSE IT WOULD A BEEN A MISERABLE BUSINESS TO HAVE ANY UNFRIENDLINESS ON THE RAFT
I THROWED THE PADDLE DOWN
I GOT UP AND TURNED AROUND IN MY TRACKS THREE TIMES AND CROSSED MY BREAST EVERY TIME
AND SHE SAID CLE'R OUT AND LET HER HAVE SOME PEACE AND IF WE COME BOTHERING AROUND HER AGAIN BETWIXT THAT AND DINNER SHE'D SKIN US
WAS GOING TO LIGHT OUT OF THE TOOLERIES A SERVANT-GIRL DONE IT
 YOU THINK YOU'RE A GOOD DEAL OF A BIG-BUG DON'T YOU MAYBE I AM MAYBE I AIN'T I SAYS
 POOR EMMELINE MADE POETRY ABOUT ALL THE DEAD PEOPLE WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE AND IT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT THAT THERE WARN'T NOBODY TO MAKE SOME ABOUT HER NOW SHE WAS GONE
 YOU DO BEAT ALL FOR NATURAL STUPIDNESS
 DON'T YOU BLAME YO'SELF BOUT IT WHEN IT WAS DAYLIGHT HERE WAS THE CLEAR OHIO WATER INSHORE SURE ENOUGH AND OUTSIDE WAS THE OLD REGULAR MUDDY
 PAP WAS PRETTY CAREFUL NOT TO LEAVE A KNIFE OR ANYTHING IN THE CABIN WHEN HE WAS AWAY
CHAPTER XXXIX
CHAPTER XXXIX
 I RECKONED THEY'D TURN PALE
AND DON'T YOU RECKON IT MAY BE HE'S HUNGRY TRUE FOR YOU RACHELI FORGOT SO THE OLD LADY SAYS
 BUT HOW YOU GOIN TO MANAGE IT THIS TIME WELL MY IDEA IS THIS
 SH-SHE LOOK AT THAT-AIR RAG LADDER SH-SHE
BY SPECIAL REQUEST HAMLET'S IMMORTAL SOLILOQUY
 "WE SHA'N'T ROB EM OF NOTHING AT ALL BUT JEST THIS MONEY
BUT SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE SHEERING OFF A BIT
 ALWAYS FETCHES THE HOUSE
JIS STOOD DAH KINER SMILIN UP AT ME
AND THEN HE TOOK HIS THEATER PAINT AND PAINTED JIM'S FACE AND HANDS AND EARS AND NECK ALL OVER A DEAD DULL SOLID BLUE LIKE A MAN THAT'S BEEN DROWNDED NINE DAYS
OTHER FOLKS HAS THEIR RIGHTS AS WELL AS YOU THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE JAWING BACK SO I SLID OUT THINKING MAYBE THERE WAS GOING TO BE TROUBLE
I'LL RUN RIGHT UP TO TOWN AND GET HIM I SAYS
MAYBE WE WENT BY CAIRO IN THE FOG THAT NIGHT HE SAYS
AND PRETTY SOON BACK HE COMES AND STOPS BEFORE THE STORE STILL KEEPING IT UP
 AND BEFORE I COULD BUDGE SHE THROWS HER ARMS AROUND MY NECK AND TOLD ME TO SAY IT AGAIN SAY IT AGAIN SAY IT AGAIN
SO TO KEEP FROM GETTING RUN OVER AND CATCHED I CRAWLED INTO A STATEROOM ON THE UPPER SIDE
THEY STOLE THAT SHIRT RIGHT OFF O THE LINE
DO YOU GO TO CHURCH TOO YESREGULAR WHERE DO YOU SET WHY IN OUR PEW WHOSE PEW WHY OURN_YOUR UNCLE HARVEY'S HIS'N
AND THAT OLD DOCTOR
 WE DIDN'T GIVE IT RIGHT UP BUT STAYED WITH THEM AS LONG AS WE COULD
I BET YOU WHAT YOU DARE I CAN SAYS HE
THERE AIN'T NO BETTER WAY TO PUT IN TIME WHEN YOU ARE LONESOME
 THEN THE PREACHER BEGUN TO PREACH AND BEGUN IN EARNEST TOO
 I USED TO BE SCARED OF HIM ALL THE TIME HE TANNED ME SO MUCH
 THAT WAS HIS STYLEHE NEVER GIVE ANYBODY A CHANCE
 WELL I TRIED THE BEST I COULD TO KINDER SOFTEN IT UP SOMEHOW FOR MYSELF BY SAYING I WAS BRUNG UP WICKED AND SO I WARN'T SO MUCH TO BLAME
 DAD BLAME IT WHY DOAN HE TALK LIKE A MAN
SO HE RAISED UP HIS BED AND SLID THE CHAIN OFF OF THE BED-LEG AND WRAPT IT ROUND AND ROUND HIS NECK AND WE CRAWLED OUT THROUGH OUR HOLE AND DOWN THERE AND JIM AND ME LAID INTO THAT GRINDSTONE AND WALKED HER ALONG LIKE NOTHING
 THE FIRST THING TO SEE LOOKING AWAY OVER THE WATER WAS A KIND OF DULL LINETHAT WAS THE WOODS ON T'OTHER SIDE
 BUT SOMEHOW I COULDN'T SEEM TO STRIKE NO PLACES TO HARDEN ME AGAINST HIM BUT ONLY THE OTHER KIND
THEY CALL THAT GOVMENT
 COLLAR ALL THESE FOUR MEN AND THE BOY AND FETCH THEM ALONG TOO WE'LL DO IT THEY ALL SHOUTED
 SOMETIMES THE WIDOW WOULD TAKE ME ONE SIDE AND TALK ABOUT PROVIDENCE IN A WAY TO MAKE A BODY'S MOUTH WATER
THEN I OUT WITH MY SAW AND WENT TO WORK ON THAT LOG AGAIN
 THEY WOULD ALL COME HANDY BY AND BY I JUDGED
 NO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE LAYING DEAD STILL ON THE WATER
 BLAMED IF I THINK I'D TRUST YOU
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I WAS ASLEEP BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS AN AWFUL SCREAM AND I WAS UP
IT WAS A REAL BULLY CIRCUS
 HE SAID THERE WAS A SPIRIT INSIDE OF IT AND IT KNOWED EVERYTHING
HE WAS MOST ALWAYS RIGHT
 AND BESIDES I'VE ALREADY TOLD EM TO PUT ON ANOTHER PLATE WHEN I SEE YOU COMING
HE WENT AWAY TO BE GONE A COUPLE OF DAYS AND SO I TOOK MY CHANCE AND STOLE SOME OF HIS DAUGHTER'S OLD CLOTHES AND CLEARED OUT AND I HAD BEEN THREE NIGHTS COMING THE THIRTY MILES
WOULD A WISE MAN WANT TO LIVE IN DE MIDS ER SICH A BLIM-BLAMMIN ALL DE TIME
I TELL YOU GENTLEMEN A NIGGER LIKE THAT IS WORTH A THOUSAND DOLLARSAND KIND TREATMENT TOO
I DIVEDAND I AIMED TO FIND THE BOTTOM TOO FOR A THIRTY-FOOT WHEEL HAD GOT TO GO OVER ME AND I WANTED IT TO HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM
WALK FAST NOW TILL YOU GET AWAY FROM THE HOUSES AND THEN SHIN FOR THE RAFT LIKE THE DICKENS WAS AFTER YOU I DONE IT AND HE DONE THE SAME
AND ABOUT HARVEY'SWHICH WAS A DISSENTERING MINISTER
KEPT IT TO MYSELF
 IS IT KETCHING IS IT KETCHING
 UNCLE SILAS HE ASKED A PRETTY LONG BLESSING OVER IT BUT IT WAS WORTH IT
THE HUNK OF BUTTER BIG AS A PERSON'S FIST WAS WHERE I HAD LEFT IT SO I TOOK UP THE SLAB OF CORN-PONE WITH IT ON AND BLOWED OUT MY LIGHT AND STARTED UP STAIRS VERY STEALTHY AND GOT UP TO THE MAIN FLOOR ALL RIGHT BUT HERE COMES AUNT SALLY WITH A CANDLE AND I CLAPPED THE TRUCK IN MY HAT AND CLAPPED MY HAT ON MY HEAD AND THE NEXT SECOND SHE SEE ME
 THE DOCTOR HE LED ME ALONG BY THE HAND AND WAS PLENTY KIND ENOUGH BUT HE NEVER LET GO MY HAND
 IN A BARREL OF ODDS AND ENDS IT IS DIFFERENT
 HE SAID HE'D BE MIGHTY SURE TO SEE IT BECAUSE HE'D BE A FREE MAN THE MINUTE HE SEEN IT BUT IF HE MISSED IT HE'D BE IN A SLAVE COUNTRY AGAIN AND NO MORE SHOW FOR FREEDOM
 AS A GENERAL THING IT MAKES A BODY WISH HE WAS DEAD TOO AND DONE WITH IT ALL
MAYBE YOU CAN GET HIM TO BELIEVE THAT JIM IS YOUR NIGGERSOME IDIOTS DON'T REQUIRE DOCUMENTSLEASTWAYS I'VE HEARD THERE'S SUCH DOWN SOUTH HERE
AND PALE NOT FIRE-FACED THE WAY HE WAS WHEN HE COME
BOTHER THEM KIND OF NAMES A BODY CAN'T EVER SEEM TO REMEMBER THEM HALF THE TIME SOMEHOW
 BUT SHE WATCHED FOR A CHANCE AND DIRECTLY BANGED AWAY AT A RAT
WHY DE GRACIOUS SAKES
SO HE TOLD JIM HOW WE'D HAVE TO SMUGGLE IN THE ROPE-LADDER PIE AND OTHER LARGE THINGS BY NAT THE NIGGER THAT FED HIM AND HE MUST BE ON THE LOOKOUT AND NOT BE SURPRISED AND NOT LET NAT SEE HIM OPEN THEM
 FORTY TO FIFTY YEARS AGO CHAPTER I
HE STIRRED UP IN A KIND OF A STARTLISH WAY
 AFTER A LONG TIME THE RAIN LET UP BUT THE CLOUDS STAYED AND THE LIGHTNING KEPT WHIMPERING AND BY AND BY A FLASH SHOWED US A BLACK THING AHEAD FLOATING AND WE MADE FOR IT
 BUCK SAID HIS FATHER AND BROTHERS OUGHT TO WAITED FOR THEIR RELATIONSTHE SHEPHERDSONS WAS TOO STRONG FOR THEM
 YOU HAIN'T DONE A THING FROM THE START THAT HAD ANY SENSE IN IT EXCEPT COMING OUT SO COOL AND CHEEKY WITH THAT IMAGINARY BLUE-ARROW MARK
 HE SAID HE DRUTHER SEE THE NEW MOON OVER HIS LEFT SHOULDER AS MUCH AS A THOUSAND TIMES THAN TAKE UP A SNAKE-SKIN IN HIS HAND
AND WAS FOR HAVING US HUNT UP A COLD-CHISEL TO CUT THE CHAIN OFF OF HIS LEG WITH RIGHT AWAY AND CLEARING OUT WITHOUT LOSING ANY TIME
SO WE LAID HIM IN THE WIGWAM AND TORE UP ONE OF THE DUKE'S SHIRTS FOR TO BANDAGE HIM BUT HE SAYS
SOLD.ROYAL COMPARISONS.JIM GETS HOME-SICK
WHY TOM  WHERE YOU BEEN ALL THIS TIME YOU RASCAL I HAIN'T BEEN NOWHERES I SAYS ONLY JUST HUNTING FOR THE RUNAWAY NIGGERME AND SID WHY WHERE EVER DID YOU GO HE SAYS
WHEN HE HAD GOT OUT ON THE SHED HE PUT HIS HEAD IN AGAIN AND CUSSED ME FOR PUTTING ON FRILLS AND TRYING TO BE BETTER THAN HIM
 HE DRANK AND DRANK AND TUMBLED DOWN ON HIS BLANKETS BY AND BY
YOU COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD THEY SAIDNOT A SINGLE WORD WELL NOW I BE DING-BUSTED
 BUT YOU NOT ONLY HAD IT IN MIND TO DO IT BUT YOU DONE IT I WISHT I NEVER DIE IF I DONE IT DUKE AND THAT'S HONEST
LIZE HURRY UP AND GET HIM A HOT BREAKFAST RIGHT AWAYOR DID YOU GET YOUR BREAKFAST ON THE BOAT I SAID I HAD GOT IT ON THE BOAT
 BUCK BEGUN TO CRY AND RIP AND LOWED THAT HIM AND HIS COUSIN JOE THAT WAS THE OTHER YOUNG CHAP WOULD MAKE UP FOR THIS DAY YET
WELL IT WOULD MAKE A COW LAUGH TO SEE THE SHINES THAT OLD IDIOT CUT
 THEN SHE SAID SHE'D FORGOT HER TESTAMENT AND LEFT IT IN THE SEAT AT CHURCH BETWEEN TWO OTHER BOOKS AND WOULD I SLIP OUT QUIET AND GO THERE AND FETCH IT TO HER AND NOT SAY NOTHING TO NOBODY
AND SURE AS YOU ARE BORN I DID CLIP IT ALONG
 PAP AND JUDGE THATCHER AND BESSIE THATCHER AND JO HARPER AND TOM SAWYER AND HIS OLD AUNT POLLY AND SID AND MARY AND PLENTY MORE
BUT IT WAS A NEW JUDGE THAT HAD JUST COME AND HE DIDN'T KNOW THE OLD MAN
 AND AT LAST SURE ENOUGH ALL THE CIRCUS MEN COULD DO THE HORSE BROKE LOOSE AND AWAY HE WENT LIKE THE VERY NATION ROUND AND ROUND THE RING WITH THAT SOT LAYING DOWN ON HIM AND HANGING TO HIS NECK WITH FIRST ONE LEG HANGING MOST TO THE GROUND ON ONE SIDE AND THEN T'OTHER ONE ON T'OTHER SIDE AND THE PEOPLE JUST CRAZY
 YOU COME IN HERE AND FEEL OF ME IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME SO HE DONE IT
FOR LUCK'S AGAINST US AND IT NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS AND WHEN I SEE THAT TRUCK I THOUGHT WE'D LOST YOU FOR I KNOWED BY THE COLOR AND ALL IT WAS JUST LIKE YOUR BRAINS WOULD BE IFDEAR DEAR WHYD'NT YOU TELL ME THAT WAS WHAT YOU'D BEEN DOWN THERE FOR I WOULDN'T A CARED
AFTER DINNER THE DUKE SAYS

 AND WE DONE IT ELEGANT TOO  HE'D GOT A START AND SHE NEVER CHECKED HIM UP JUST SET AND STARED AND STARED AND LET HIM CLIP ALONG AND I SEE IT WARN'T NO USE FOR ME TO PUT IN
 THEN WE HUNTED UP A PLACE CLOSE BY TO HIDE THE CANOE IN AMONGST THE THICK WILLOWS
 WE LAID THERE ALL DAY AND WATCHED THE RAFTS AND STEAMBOATS SPIN DOWN THE MISSOURI SHORE AND UP-BOUND STEAMBOATS FIGHT THE BIG RIVER IN THE MIDDLE
 I GAVE HIS SHOULDER TWO OR THREE LITTLE SHOVES AND BEGUN TO CRY
CHAPTER XIII
THE PLACE TO BUY CANOES IS OFF OF RAFTS LAYING UP AT SHORE
HE SAID IT WAS THE BEST FUN HE EVER HAD IN HIS LIFE AND THE MOST INTELLECTURAL
 _YOU PETER WILKS'S BROTHER
 SEEMED LIKE I'D DIE IF I COULDN'T SCRATCH
 THE RIVER WAS VERY WIDE AND WAS WALLED WITH SOLID TIMBER ON BOTH SIDES
MORE HOUNDS ASLEEP ROUND ABOUT
 HE SAID THERE WAS LOADS OF THEM THERE ANYWAY
THEN ANOTHER AND THIS TIME I WAS RIGHT
THEN YOU COME OUT AND SPREAD THE NEWS AROUND AND GET THESE BEATS JAILED GOOD SHE SAYS I'LL DO IT AND IF IT JUST HAPPENS SO THAT I DON'T GET AWAY BUT GET TOOK UP ALONG WITH THEM YOU MUST UP AND SAY I TOLD YOU THE WHOLE THING BEFOREHAND AND YOU MUST STAND BY ME ALL YOU CAN STAND BY YOU
HUCK AND THE JUDGE.SUPERSTITION
AT LAST THEY GOT OUT THE COFFIN AND BEGUN TO UNSCREW THE LID AND THEN SUCH ANOTHER CROWDING AND SHOULDERING AND SHOVING AS THERE WAS TO SCROUGE IN AND GET A SIGHT YOU NEVER SEE
 I WAS A-BILIN
WELL THEN IF YOU'RE BOUND TO GO I'LL TELL YOU THE WAY TO DO WHEN YOU GET TO THE VILLAGE
 MY THE WAY THE KING'S EYES DID SHINE
 THE PEOPLE WOKE UP MORE AND MORE AND SUNG LOUDER AND LOUDER
 AND HE ALWAYS LET ON THAT PETER WROTE HIM THE THINGS
 THE FAMILY WAS AT HOME
 I BEGUN TO THINK HOW DREADFUL IT WAS EVEN FOR MURDERERS TO BE IN SUCH A FIX
 SO I KNOWED THEN THAT THIS WARN'T PAP BUT A WOMAN DRESSED UP IN A MAN'S CLOTHES
AND A STREAK OF BUTTER COME A-TRICKLING DOWN MY FOREHEAD AND AUNT SALLY SHE SEE IT AND TURNS WHITE AS A SHEET AND SAYS
 SO JIM HE SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND WE SET THERE AND TALKED OVER OLD TIMES AWHILE AND THEN TOM ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND WHEN JIM TOLD HIM UNCLE SILAS COME IN EVERY DAY OR TWO TO PRAY WITH HIM AND AUNT SALLY COME IN TO SEE IF HE WAS COMFORTABLE AND HAD PLENTY TO EAT AND BOTH OF THEM WAS KIND AS THEY COULD BE TOM SAYS
 THE THING IS FOR YOU TO TREAT HIM KIND AND NOT BE SAYING THINGS TO MAKE HIM REMEMBER HE AIN'T IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AND AMONGST HIS OWN FOLKS I SAYS TO MYSELF THIS IS A GIRL THAT I'M LETTING THAT OLD REPTILE ROB HER OF HER MONEY
 I WAS GOING TO FOLLOW AROUND BUT I STOOPED DOWN TO LOOK AT THE TRACKS FIRST
 YOU CAN'T TELL THE SHAPE OF THE RIVER AND YOU CAN'T SEE NO DISTANCE
 HIS FOOT SWELLED UP PRETTY BIG AND SO DID HIS LEG
 AND THAT IS THERE'S A NIGGER HERE THAT I'M A-TRYING TO STEAL OUT OF SLAVERY AND HIS NAME IS JIM_OLD MISS WATSON'S JIM HE SAYS
 IF YOU'LL PROMISE YOU WON'T BLOW AND WON'T LET THE NIGGER BLOW I'LL TELL YOU WHERE TO FIND HIM SO I PROMISED AND HE SAYS
AND THE REST SCATTER AROUND A PIECE AND LISTEN IF YOU CAN HEAR EM COMING SO IN THEY COME BUT COULDN'T SEE US IN THE DARK AND MOST TROD ON US WHILST WE WAS HUSTLING TO GET UNDER THE BED
 JIM SAID HE'D HAD IT THERE A LONG TIME TO COAT IT OVER SO AND MAKE A BALL OF IT
 THE HOGS LOAFED AND GRUNTED AROUND EVERYWHERES
 WE DON'T RUN DAYTIMES NO MORE NOW
GOOD LAN
 "NO
 HE PROMISED HE WOULD GO TO THE NIGGER CABINS AND DROP ONE PRIVATE IN JIM'S COFFEE-POT IN THE MORNING
 I PLAYED IT AS LOW DOWN ON THEM AS I COULD
I RECKONED I WOULDN'T STAY ON HAND TILL HE GOT THAT CHANCE
PRODUCED BY DAVID WIDGER ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN TOM SAWYER'S COMRADE BY MARK TWAIN COMPLETE CONTENTS
SO WE'LL LET IT GO
NOW SHE HAD GOT A START AND SHE WENT ON AND TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THE GOOD PLACE
 ONLY I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
 NO THERE WARN'T NO REAL SCARCITY OF SNAKES ABOUT THE HOUSE FOR A CONSIDERABLE SPELL
THEN MORE PALENESS SPREADING AROUND
 BUT NOW IT DID
 PA'S GOT A FEW BUCKSHOT IN HIM
 BUT IT WARN'T NO USE TO WORRY
WE HAD MOUNTAINS ON THE MISSOURI SHORE AND HEAVY TIMBER ON THE ILLINOIS SIDE AND THE CHANNEL WAS DOWN THE MISSOURI SHORE AT THAT PLACE SO WE WARN'T AFRAID OF ANYBODY RUNNING ACROSS US
SHE SAYS TAKE YOUR HANDS AWAY HUCKLEBERRY
HELLO!WHY I'M AT HOME
THIS N S A SUNDAY-SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT TO HIM
 SO ALONG IN THE AFTERNOON HE SAYS
AND THEN SHE SAID SHE'D FORGIVE US AND MAYBE IT WAS ALL RIGHT ENOUGH ANYWAY AND ABOUT WHAT A BODY MIGHT EXPECT OF BOYS FOR ALL BOYS WAS A PRETTY HARUM-SCARUM LOT AS FUR AS SHE COULD SEE
 HERE SICH N SICH A PERSON BUSTED HIS HEART
WELL THE VERY FIRST MAN I SEE WHEN I GOT THERE WAS THE DUKE
IT STANDS TO REASON
GO LONG TO YOUR PLAY AND DON'T BOTHER ME
 THERE WAS A LIGHT BURNING IN A LITTLE SHANTY THAT HADN'T BEEN LIVED IN FOR A LONG TIME AND I WONDERED WHO HAD TOOK UP QUARTERS THERE
THE JUDGE GAVE HIM SOME AND THAT EVENING HE GOT DRUNK AND WAS AROUND TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT WITH A COUPLE OF MIGHTY HARD-LOOKING STRANGERS AND THEN WENT OFF WITH THEM
 BUT YOU WOULDN TELL ON ME EF I UZ TO TELL YOU WOULD YOU HUCK BLAMED IF I WOULD JIM WELL I B'LIEVE YOU HUCK
AND ANYBODY BUT A LOT OF PREJUDICED CHUCKLEHEADS WOULD A SEEN THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SPINNING TRUTH AND T'OTHER ONE LIES
AND GREEN SUMMER GRAPES AND GREEN RAZBERRIES
SO AT LAST I GOT DOWN BUT I KEPT IN THE THICK WOODS AND ON THE LOOKOUT ALL THE TIME
 BUT TOM THOUGHT OF SOMETHING AND SAYS
 I SMELT SICKLY EGGS BY THE BARREL AND ROTTEN CABBAGES AND SUCH THINGS
SO WE SHOVED OUT AFTER DARK ON THE RAFT
 I GOT OUT AMONGST THE DRIFTWOOD AND THEN LAID DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CANOE AND LET HER FLOAT
 AWAY DOWN THERE SOMEWHERES I HEARS A SMALL WHOOP AND UP COMES MY SPIRITS
 IF THERE'S ANYBODY WITH YOU LET HIM KEEP BACKIF HE SHOWS HIMSELF HE'LL BE SHOT
 MAKE THE BEST O THINGS THE WAY YOU FIND EM SAYS ITHAT'S MY MOTTO
 AND ALL THE TIME HE WAS A-DOING IT HE TRIED TO TALK LIKE AN ENGLISHMAN
 A JEWS-HARP'S PLENTY GOOD ENOUGH FOR A RAT
I TOOK THE CANOE OUT FROM THE SHORE A LITTLE PIECE AND TOOK A LOOK
 "WHAT MADE YOU THINK I'D LIKE IT WELL I DON'T KNOW
 SOME AUTHORITIES THINK DIFFERENT BUT MOSTLY IT'S CONSIDERED BEST TO KILL THEMEXCEPT SOME THAT YOU BRING TO THE CAVE HERE AND KEEP THEM TILL THEY'RE RANSOMED RANSOMED
 I'VE WALKED ALL THE WAY AND I'M ALL TIRED OUT HUNGRY TOO I RECKON
 SO WE HAD THE ODD SPOON AND DROPPED IT IN HER APRON-POCKET WHILST SHE WAS A-GIVING US OUR SAILING ORDERS AND JIM GOT IT ALL RIGHT ALONG WITH HER SHINGLE NAIL BEFORE NOON
I WENT DOWN TO THE FRONT GARDEN AND CLUMB OVER THE STILE WHERE YOU GO THROUGH THE HIGH BOARD FENCE
AND KEPT ASKING ME EVERY NOW AND THEN IF I RECKONED HE COULD A GOT LOST OR HURT OR MAYBE DROWNDED AND MIGHT BE LAYING AT THIS MINUTE SOMEWHERES SUFFERING OR DEAD AND SHE NOT BY HIM TO HELP HIM AND SO THE TEARS WOULD DRIP DOWN SILENT AND I WOULD TELL HER THAT SID WAS ALL RIGHT AND WOULD BE HOME IN THE MORNING SURE
THEN HE ROLLED OVER AND OVER WONDERFUL FAST KICKING THINGS EVERY WHICH WAY AND STRIKING AND GRABBING AT THE AIR WITH HIS HANDS AND SCREAMING AND SAYING THERE WAS DEVILS A-HOLD OF HIM
 I HEARD ABOUT IT AWAY DOWN THE RIVER TOO
DO I KNOW YOU
IT WAS A MONSTROUS BIG RIVER HERE WITH THE TALLEST AND THE THICKEST KIND OF TIMBER ON BOTH BANKS
 SO SAYS I S'POSE SOMEBODY HAS HOGGED THAT BAG ON THE SLY?NOW HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER TO WRITE TO MARY JANE OR NOT
 AND WHEN SHE WAS GOING AWAY SHE LOOKED DOWN IN MY EYES SO STEADY AND GENTLE AND SAYS
 SHE WARN'T ON'Y BOUT FO YEAR OLE EN SHE TUCK DE SK'YARLET FEVER EN HAD A POWFUL ROUGH SPELL
 I RECKONED JIM HAD FETCHED UP ON A SNAG MAYBE AND IT WAS ALL UP WITH HIM
A PIOUS KING.THE KING'S CLERGY.SHE ASKED HIS PARDON.HIDING IN THE ROOM.HUCK TAKES THE MONEY
AND WILL LET YOU WRAP HIM ROUND YOUR NECK AND PUT HIS HEAD IN YOUR MOUTH PLEASE MARS TOM_DOAN TALK SO
 WELL I RECKON YOU'D THINK SO IF YOU'D A BEEN IN THIS HOUSE FOR A WHILE BACK
 BUT I HADN'T NO CONFIDENCE
 HE FETCHED UNCLE A KEY ABOUT THE TIME WE GOT UP FROM TABLESAME KEY I BET
AND EVERY MINUTE SOMEBODY WOULD SAY OVER A FENCE
DOES A CAT TALK LIKE WE DO NO A CAT DON'T WELL DOES A COW NO A COW DON'T NUTHER DOES A CAT TALK LIKE A COW OR A COW TALK LIKE A CAT NO DEY DON'T IT'S NATURAL AND RIGHT FOR EM TO TALK DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER AIN'T IT COURSE AND AIN'T IT NATURAL AND RIGHT FOR A CAT AND A COW TO TALK DIFFERENT FROM US WHY MOS SHOLY IT IS WELL THEN WHY AIN'T IT NATURAL AND RIGHT FOR A FRENCHMAN TO TALK DIFFERENT FROM US
AFTER BREAKFAST THE KING HE TOOK A SEAT ON THE CORNER OF THE RAFT AND PULLED OFF HIS BOOTS AND ROLLED UP HIS BRITCHES AND LET HIS LEGS DANGLE IN THE WATER SO AS TO BE COMFORTABLE AND LIT HIS PIPE AND WENT TO GETTING HIS ROMEO AND JULIET BY HEART
 GO ALONG HOME AND ADVISE EVERYBODY TO COME AND SEE THE TRAGEDY NEXT DAY YOU COULDN'T HEAR NOTHING AROUND THAT TOWN BUT HOW SPLENDID THAT SHOW WAS
AND HE NAILED THAT SHINGLE TO A LATH AND STOOD THE LATH UP FOUR OR FIVE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE WIGWAM
 MISS SOPHIA SHE TURNED PALE BUT THE COLOR COME BACK WHEN SHE FOUND THE MAN WARN'T HURT
 WE LAID UP FOR THE DAY ON A TOWHEAD TOLERABLE CLOSE TO THE LEFT-HAND BANK
 I AIN'T BLAMING YOU GENTLEMEN
AND I WAS SORRY FOR THEM POOR PITIFUL RASCALS IT SEEMED LIKE I COULDN'T EVER FEEL ANY HARDNESS AGAINST THEM ANY MORE IN THE WORLD
 I HAIN'T EVER DONE NO HARM TO A GHOS  I ALWUZ LIKED DEAD PEOPLE EN DONE ALL I COULD FOR EM
THEN COMES A H-WHACK!BUM
 NOBODY COULD SPREAD HIMSELF LIKE TOM SAWYER IN SUCH A THING AS THAT
 YOU BORRY'D STORE TOBACKER AND PAID BACK NIGGER-HEAD STORE TOBACCO IS FLAT BLACK PLUG BUT THESE FELLOWS MOSTLY CHAWS THE NATURAL LEAF TWISTED
 JIM TRIED IT AGAIN AND THEN ANOTHER TIME AND IT ACTED JUST THE SAME
 YOUR GRACE LL TAKE THE SHUCK BED YOURSELF JIM AND ME WAS IN A SWEAT AGAIN FOR A MINUTE BEING AFRAID THERE WAS GOING TO BE SOME MORE TROUBLE AMONGST THEM
 "IT AIN'T RIGHT NOR KIND FOR YOU TO TALK SO TO HIM AND HIM A STRANGER AND SO FAR FROM HIS PEOPLE
AND THEN SAYS
 THAT WAS MY FIX EXACTLY
CHAPTER X
CHAPTER X
NOT AS I KNOWS ON SO TOM TURNS TO THE NIGGER WHICH WAS LOOKING WILD AND DISTRESSED AND SAYS KIND OF SEVERE
AND THEY LEANED EVERY WHICH-WAY AND HAD GATES THAT DIDN'T GENERLY HAVE BUT ONE HINGEA LEATHER ONE
A LITTLE SMOKE COULDN'T BE NOTICED NOW SO WE WOULD TAKE SOME FISH OFF OF THE LINES AND COOK UP A HOT BREAKFAST
CHAPTER XXXII
CHAPTER XXXII
AND I MUST SAY IT MAKES ME DREADFUL UNEASY UNEASY SHE SAYS
 HE SAID SOME OF IT BUT THE REST WAS OUT OF PIRATE-BOOKS AND ROBBER-BOOKS AND EVERY GANG THAT WAS HIGH-TONED HAD IT
 SHE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE RATS
 I REACHED FOR SOME OF IT AS QUICK AS I COULD TO THROW OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER AND KEEP OFF THE BAD LUCK BUT MISS WATSON WAS IN AHEAD OF ME AND CROSSED ME OFF
 SO WE SLEPT ALL DAY AMONGST THE COTTONWOOD THICKET SO AS TO BE FRESH FOR THE WORK AND WHEN WE WENT BACK TO THE RAFT ABOUT DARK THE CANOE WAS GONE
AND HER EYES SNAPPED AND HER FINGERS WORKED LIKE SHE WANTED TO SCRATCH HIM
 I MADE UP MY MIND I WOULDN'T EVER TAKE A-HOLT OF A SNAKE-SKIN AGAIN WITH MY HANDS NOW THAT I SEE WHAT HAD COME OF IT
AND THEN HE BEGINS TO RIP AND RAVE AND GRIT HIS TEETH
THEN TOM SAID HE HADN'T GOT CANDLES ENOUGH AND HE WOULD SLIP IN THE KITCHEN AND GET SOME MORE
 WE SCROUCHED DOWN AND LAID STILL
 HE WAS SO GLAD TO SEE US HE MOST CRIED
CHAPTER XXVII
CHAPTER XXVII
BUT WHAT DOES THESE THINGS STAND FOR IT WAS THE LEAVES AND RUBBISH ON THE RAFT AND THE SMASHED OAR
 BUT I KNOWED THEY'D MAKE TROUBLE AND I THOUGHT IF YOU WARN'T IN NO HURRY I'D WELL YOU DO NEED SKINNING THERE AIN'T NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT
BUT I'LL GO AND SEE
CERT'NLY
AND IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT SMOOTHS PEOPLE'S ROADS THE MOST DOWN HERE BELOW
THEN WE COULD BOOM RIGHT ALONG IF WE WANTED TO
 A BED
AND SO SURE ENOUGH TOM SAWYER HAD GONE AND TOOK ALL THAT TROUBLE AND BOTHER TO SET A FREE NIGGER FREE
HEAH'S YOUDAT'S DE YUTHER ONE
WHEN HIM AND THE OLD LADY COME DOWN IN THE MORNING ALL THE FAMILY GOT UP OUT OF THEIR CHAIRS AND GIVE THEM GOOD-DAY AND DIDN'T SET DOWN AGAIN TILL THEY HAD SET DOWN
 WELL I WAS DOZING OFF AGAIN WHEN I THINKS I HEARS A DEEP SOUND OF BOOM AWAY UP THE RIVER
AND BEFORE LONG A BIG IRON-JAWED MAN WORKED HIMSELF IN THERE FROM OUTSIDE AND STOOD A-LISTENING AND LOOKING AND NOT SAYING ANYTHING
ALL RIGHT THEN I'LL GO TO HELL"AND TORE IT UP
 THEY HAD THE CHEEK THEM FRAUDS
 HE SAID HE WOULD SHOW WHO WAS HUCK FINN'S BOSS
 PRETTY SOON A SPLENDID YOUNG MAN COME GALLOPING DOWN THE ROAD SETTING HIS HORSE EASY AND LOOKING LIKE A SOLDIER
SENDS THE KEY TO THE PUNKIN-HEADED NIGGER AND DON'T SEND NOBODY TO WATCH THE NIGGER
I LIT A PIPE AND HAD A GOOD LONG SMOKE AND WENT ON WATCHING
 SPLENDID
 I BE BOUND IF I HAVE TO TAKE A-HOLT OF YOU I'LL THEY'RE IN THE TRUNK
 THEN AS MUCH AS A DOZEN PEOPLE GOT OUT THEIR BOTTLES AND TREATED HIM
 TAKE IT ALL ROUND WE LIVED PRETTY HIGH
 BY AND BY I HEARD THE KING AND THE DUKE COME UP
 THERE WAS AN INCH OF NEW SNOW ON THE GROUND AND I SEEN SOMEBODY'S TRACKS
 I HAD TO SKIP AROUND A BIT AND JUMP UP AND CRACK MY HEELS A FEW TIMESI COULDN'T HELP IT
SO TOM SAYS
I HAIN GOT NO USE F'R UM SKASELY BUT JIM YOU GOT TO HAVE EMTHEY ALL DO
WE CAN TEAR UP OUR SHEETS AND MAKE HIM A ROPE LADDER EASY ENOUGH
WHERE'S THE BUTTER I LAID OUT A HUNK OF IT I SAYS ON A PIECE OF A CORN-PONE WELL YOU LEFT IT LAID OUT THENIT AIN'T HERE WE CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT IT I SAYS
OF COURSE ANYBODY WOULD
WELL TO THINK OF THAT PERFORMANCE
 IT INJURED THE FRAUDS SOME
I HAIN'T BEEN SO PUT OUT SINCE I DON'T KNOW WHEN
HER TONGUE WAS A-GOING ALL THE TIME
HER SISTER MISS WATSON A TOLERABLE SLIM OLD MAID WITH GOGGLES ON HAD JUST COME TO LIVE WITH HER AND TOOK A SET AT ME NOW WITH A SPELLING-BOOK
THINK O WHAT BRER PHELPS S'I
 THAT WAS TO KEEP WITCHES OFF
AND I TOLD TOM ALL ABOUT OUR ROYAL NONESUCH RAPSCALLIONS AND AS MUCH OF THE RAFT VOYAGE AS I HAD TIME TO
 BUT NEXT MINUTE I WHIRLED IN ON A KIND OF AN EXPLANATION HOW A VALLEY WAS DIFFERENT FROM A COMMON SERVANT AND HAD TO GO TO CHURCH WHETHER HE WANTED TO OR NOT AND SET WITH THE FAMILY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BEING THE LAW
SO I LAID OUTSIDEI DIDN'T MIND THE RAIN BECAUSE IT WAS WARM AND THE WAVES WARN'T RUNNING SO HIGH NOW
HOW LONG YOU BEN ON DE ISLAN SINCE THE NIGHT I GOT KILLED NO
 I COULDN'T SOMEHOW FOR THINKING
 ONE WAS A BIG FAMILY BIBLE FULL OF PICTURES
 THESE UNCLES OF YOURN AIN'T NO UNCLES AT ALL
 I'M FOR KILLIN HIMAND DIDN'T HE KILL OLD HATFIELD JIST THE SAME WAYAND DON'T HE DESERVE IT BUT I DON'T WANT HIM KILLED AND I'VE GOT MY REASONS FOR IT BLESS YO HEART FOR THEM WORDS JAKE PACKARD
SICK HIM TIGE AND AWAY THE SOW WOULD GO SQUEALING MOST HORRIBLE WITH A DOG OR TWO SWINGING TO EACH EAR AND THREE OR FOUR DOZEN MORE A-COMING
 DID YOU INQUIRE AROUND FOR HIM WHEN YOU GOT LOOSE
 THEY'VE GOT TO STAND IT YET A WHILE
AND AS FOR JIM HE AIN'T HAD NO EXPERIENCE AND SO HE DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF A OH SHUCKS HUCK FINN IF I WAS AS IGNORANT AS YOU I'D KEEP STILLTHAT'S WHAT I'D DO
PEOPLE MIGHT KNOW MY VOICE AND FIND ME OUT
 THE FIRST FELLOW SAID HE LOWED TO TELL IT TO HIS OLD WOMANSHE WOULD THINK IT WAS PRETTY GOOD
 MARY JANE SHE SET AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE WITH SUSAN ALONGSIDE OF HER AND SAID HOW BAD THE BISCUITS WAS AND HOW MEAN THE PRESERVES WAS AND HOW ORNERY AND TOUGH THE FRIED CHICKENS WASAND ALL THAT KIND OF ROT THE WAY WOMEN ALWAYS DO FOR TO FORCE OUT COMPLIMENTS
AND WHEN HE WAS IN HE SAID HE WAS A STRANGER FROM HICKSVILLE OHIO AND HIS NAME WAS WILLIAM THOMPSONAND HE MADE ANOTHER BOW
 ONE WAS A WOMAN IN A SLIM BLACK DRESS BELTED SMALL UNDER THE ARMPITS WITH BULGES LIKE A CABBAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SLEEVES AND A LARGE BLACK SCOOP-SHOVEL BONNET WITH A BLACK VEIL AND WHITE SLIM ANKLES CROSSED ABOUT WITH BLACK TAPE AND VERY WEE BLACK SLIPPERS LIKE A CHISEL AND SHE WAS LEANING PENSIVE ON A TOMBSTONE ON HER RIGHT ELBOW UNDER A WEEPING WILLOW AND HER OTHER HAND HANGING DOWN HER SIDE HOLDING A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF AND A RETICULE AND UNDERNEATH THE PICTURE IT SAID SHALL I NEVER SEE THEE MORE ALAS  ANOTHER ONE WAS A YOUNG LADY WITH HER HAIR ALL COMBED UP STRAIGHT TO THE TOP OF HER HEAD AND KNOTTED THERE IN FRONT OF A COMB LIKE A CHAIR-BACK AND SHE WAS CRYING INTO A HANDKERCHIEF AND HAD A DEAD BIRD LAYING ON ITS BACK IN HER OTHER HAND WITH ITS HEELS UP AND UNDERNEATH THE PICTURE IT SAID I SHALL NEVER HEAR THY SWEET CHIRRUP MORE ALAS  THERE WAS ONE WHERE A YOUNG LADY WAS AT A WINDOW LOOKING UP AT THE MOON AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HER CHEEKS
JIM AND ME GOT UNEASY
SO WE WENT ON DOWN TO THE HUT BY THE ASH-HOPPER FOR TO EXAMINE IT
FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF IMPERATIVE EUROPEAN ENGAGEMENTS
 I'VE GOT A NOTION AND I THINK IT'S A SOUND ONE WHAT IS IT DUKE THAT WE BETTER GLIDE OUT OF THIS BEFORE THREE IN THE MORNING AND CLIP IT DOWN THE RIVER WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT
 I GOT INTO MY OLD RAGS AND MY SUGAR-HOGSHEAD AGAIN AND WAS FREE AND SATISFIED
 THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE WHISKY DRINKING GOING ON AND I SEEN THREE FIGHTS
 YOU AIN'T THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S BEN SNAKED DOWN WRONGFULLY OUT'N A HIGH PLACE ALAS NO YOU AIN'T THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S HAD A SECRET OF HIS BIRTH  AND BY JINGS HE BEGINS TO CRY
GOOD-_NESS GRACIOUS SHE SAYS WHAT IN THE WARLD CAN HAVE BECOME OF HIM I CAN'T IMAGINE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN
THEN THE DUKE HE LETS THE CURTAIN DOWN AND BOWS TO THE PEOPLE AND SAYS THE GREAT TRAGEDY WILL BE PERFORMED ONLY TWO NIGHTS MORE ON ACCOUNTS OF PRESSING LONDON ENGAGEMENTS WHERE THE SEATS IS ALL SOLD ALREADY FOR IT IN DRURY LANE
 IT MUST A BEEN DONE
 EVERYBODY LOVED TO HAVE HIM AROUND TOO
BUT IT WAS HIGH GROUND SO I DIDN'T GO
 THAT ALL COMES OF MY BEING SUCH A FOOL AS TO NOT REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOU LEAVE A DEAD SNAKE ITS MATE ALWAYS COMES THERE AND CURLS AROUND IT
BUT MIND YOU DON'T WORK YOUR JAW ANY BETWEEN HERE AND THERE SO I LEFT AND STRUCK FOR THE BACK COUNTRY
 I HOPE SO ANYWAY I DIDN'T HOPE SO
BUT I COULD HEAR THE MUMBLE AND NOW AND THEN A LAUGH TOO BUT IT SEEMED A LONG WAYS OFF
 I WAS ABOUT TO DIG OUT FROM THERE IN A HURRY BUT THEY WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO ME THEN AND SUNG OUT AND BEGGED ME TO SAVE THEIR LIVESSAID THEY HADN'T BEEN DOING NOTHING AND WAS BEING CHASED FOR ITSAID THERE WAS MEN AND DOGS A-COMING
 YOU COULD SEE IT WAS A GREAT SATISFACTION TO THE PEOPLE BECAUSE NATURALLY THEY WANTED TO KNOW
AND SAYS IF HIS POOR BROTHER LAYING YONDER COULD SPEAK HE KNOWS WHO HE WOULD NAME FOR THEY WAS NAMES THAT WAS VERY DEAR TO HIM AND MENTIONED OFTEN IN HIS LETTERS
AT LAST I HEARS THE ANSWER A LONG WAYS OFF AND TRIES TO FOLLOW IT BUT I COULDN'T DO IT AND DIRECTLY I JUDGED I'D GOT INTO A NEST OF TOWHEADS FOR I HAD LITTLE DIM GLIMPSES OF THEM ON BOTH SIDES OF MESOMETIMES JUST A NARROW CHANNEL BETWEEN AND SOME THAT I COULDN'T SEE I KNOWED WAS THERE BECAUSE I'D HEAR THE WASH OF THE CURRENT AGAINST THE OLD DEAD BRUSH AND TRASH THAT HUNG OVER THE BANKS
AND AT LAST WHEN HE'D GOT EVERYBODY'S EXPECTATIONS UP HIGH ENOUGH HE ROLLED UP THE CURTAIN AND THE NEXT MINUTE THE KING COME A-PRANCING OUT ON ALL FOURS NAKED
 THEN I REMEMBERED
 I SAYS GO ON
 HE STARTED AND RUN ROUND AND ROUND THE CABIN HOLLERING TAKE HIM OFF
COME IN COME IN TOM HE TOOK A LOOK BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AND SAYS TOO LATEHE'S OUT OF SIGHT YES HE'S GONE MY SON AND YOU MUST COME IN AND EAT YOUR DINNER WITH US
SHE COULDN'T FACE NOWAY AND BE SATISFIED BECAUSE SHE ALLOWED THERE WAS SOMETHING BEHIND HER EVERY TIMESO SHE WAS ALWAYS A-WHIRLING AROUND SUDDEN AND SAYING OUCH AND BEFORE SHE'D GOT TWO-THIRDS AROUND SHE'D WHIRL BACK AGAIN AND SAY IT AGAIN
IT KEPT COMING AND KEPT CHANGING ITS PLACE AND I KEPT ANSWERING TILL BY AND BY IT WAS IN FRONT OF ME AGAIN AND I KNOWED THE CURRENT HAD SWUNG THE CANOE'S HEAD DOWN-STREAM AND I WAS ALL RIGHT IF THAT WAS JIM AND NOT SOME OTHER RAFTSMAN HOLLERING
 WELL I COULDN'T SEE NO ADVANTAGE IN GOING WHERE SHE WAS GOING SO I MADE UP MY MIND I WOULDN'T TRY FOR IT
 JIST FOR NOTH'N
 THERE WAS TEN AND NOW THER'S ONLY NINE
 I WISHED THE WOMAN WOULD SAY SOMETHING MORE
AND HE WAS THAT GLAD TO SEE ME AGAIN HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
 SHE WAS SMILING ALL OVER SO SHE COULD HARDLY STANDAND SAYS
I TOOK AFTER IT
AND THE NEXT STEP FETCHED US IN FRONT OF THE CAPTAIN'S DOOR WHICH WAS OPEN AND BY JIMMINY AWAY DOWN THROUGH THE TEXAS-HALL WE SEE A LIGHT
 THE RINGMASTER COULDN'T EVER SAY A WORD TO HIM BUT HE WAS BACK AT HIM QUICK AS A WINK WITH THE FUNNIEST THINGS A BODY EVER SAID
THE PHELPSES DOWN YONDER OH HE SAYS
 THE JUNE RISE USED TO BE ALWAYS LUCK FOR ME
 I HAD MY GUN ALONG BUT I HADN'T SHOT NOTHING
BUT HE SAID THAT WARN'T NOTHING TO SOME THINGS HE HAD SAID IN HIS TIME
WE USED TO WATCH THE STARS THAT FELL TOO AND SEE THEM STREAK DOWN
 SHE WAS TORE UP A GOOD DEALONE EN OF HER WAS
 HE HAD GOT UP THAT JOKE ALL OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD AND NEVER LET ON TO NOBODY
 THINKS I WHAT DOES IT MEAN
 IT WARN'T NO USE TO TRY AND HIDE IT FROM HIM
 PAP ALWAYS SAID IT WARN'T NO HARM TO BORROW THINGS IF YOU WAS MEANING TO PAY THEM BACK SOME TIME
 I NEVER SEE SUCH A WOMAN
 DOES YOU WANT TO GO EN LOOK AT IM YES I HUNCHED TOM AND WHISPERS
 THEN IN ABOUT TWO SECONDS WE HEARD A WHACK AND THE DOG HE FINISHED UP WITH A MOST AMAZING HOWL OR TWO AND THEN EVERYTHING WAS DEAD STILL AND THE PARSON BEGUN HIS SOLEMN TALK WHERE HE LEFT OFF
WHO DAH HE LISTENED SOME MORE
I HAD WORE THE GROUND A GOOD DEAL CRAWLING OUT OF THE HOLE AND DRAGGING OUT SO MANY THINGS
 HE'D LET ME SHOVE HIS HEAD IN MY MOUFFER A FAVOR HAIN'T IT
 WE ARE HIGHWAYMEN
 DEY AIN NO SENSE IN IT LOOKY HERE JIM
SO I FELT SORT OF CORNERED AND WAS AFEARED MAYBE I WAS LOOKING IT TOO
 AND THERE WAS NICE SPLIT-BOTTOM CHAIRS AND PERFECTLY SOUND TOONOT BAGGED DOWN IN THE MIDDLE AND BUSTED LIKE AN OLD BASKET
 SHE AIN DAH NO MO NOW I RECKON THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END
WHY DEAR ME I NEVER SEE SUCH A SURPRISE
 THE POOR GIRLS WAS HANGING TO THE KING AND CRYING
BUT THEY WOULDN'T TOUCH IT BECAUSE THE DEVIL HAD HAD HIS HANDS ON IT
AND WE JUMPED TO ONE SIDE TO LET THEM GO BY
IT'S HIS RIGHT
 I KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME SAYS THE DOCTOR
 AND WHEN HE DONE IT THE THIRD TIME HE SAYS
ONE OF THESE FELLOWS WAS ABOUT SEVENTY OR UPWARDS AND HAD A BALD HEAD AND VERY GRAY WHISKERS
PEOPLE DAT'S SOT STAYS SOT
 DE LORD GOD AMIGHTY FOGIVE PO OLE JIM KAZE HE NEVER GWYNE TO FOGIVE HISSELF AS LONG'S HE LIVE  OH SHE WAS PLUMB DEEF EN DUMB HUCK PLUMB DEEF EN DUMBEN I'D BEN A-TREAT'N HER SO CHAPTER XXIV
AND IT MAKES ME FEEL PRETTY SILLY TO THINK HOW THEY GOT IT NO YOU'RE OUT THERE
AND PRETTY SOON JUMPS UP AND SAYS
THEY ALL DO WHAT IN THE NATION CAN HE DO WITH IT DO WITH IT
 I SET THE CANDLE DOWN
MR ARCHIBALD NICHOLS I PRESUME NO MY BOY SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN I'M SORRY TO SAY T YOUR DRIVER HAS DECEIVED YOU
AND THEY HAD TURNED THE WHOLE THING INTO AN INFANT SUNDAY-SCHOOL JUST OUT OF SPITE
WELL THE FIRST I KNOWED THE KING GOT A-GOING AND YOU COULD HEAR HIM OVER EVERYBODY
 COULD YOU RAISE A FLOWER HERE DO YOU RECKON I DOAN KNOW BUT MAYBE I COULD MARS TOM
YOU CAN'T STAY SO YOU SOON GET OVER IT
 SO EVERY ONE OF THEM PROMISED RIGHT OUT AND HEARTY THAT THEY WOULDN'T CUSS HIM NO MORE
 TOM SAWYER CALLED THE HOGS INGOTS AND HE CALLED THE TURNIPS AND STUFF JULERY AND WE WOULD GO TO THE CAVE AND POWWOW OVER WHAT WE HAD DONE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WE HAD KILLED AND MARKED
AND HE MADE HIM SIGH AND PUT HIS HAND ON HIS HEART AND AFTER A WHILE HE SAID HE DONE IT PRETTY WELL
 BUT TOM WANTED TO RESK IT
 IT WAS A DIRTY LITTERED-UP PLACE AND HAD INK MARKS AND HANDBILLS WITH PICTURES OF HORSES AND RUNAWAY NIGGERS ON THEM ALL OVER THE WALLS
BOGGS THROWS UP BOTH OF HIS HANDS AND SAYS O LORD DON'T SHOOT  BANG
 WE PUT OUT THE CAMP FIRE AT THE CAVERN THE FIRST THING AND DIDN'T SHOW A CANDLE OUTSIDE AFTER THAT
 "I'LL GO TO UNCLE HARVEY AND OH YES I SAYS I WOULD
 IT WAS SO LONG AGO DON'T ANYBODY KNOW OH YES PA KNOWS I RECKON AND SOME OF THE OTHER OLD PEOPLE
 THE BOYS JUMPED FOR THE RIVERBOTH OF THEM HURTAND AS THEY SWUM DOWN THE CURRENT THE MEN RUN ALONG THE BANK SHOOTING AT THEM AND SINGING OUT KILL THEM KILL THEM  IT MADE ME SO SICK I MOST FELL OUT OF THE TREE
THEN THAT OTHER MAN'S BROTHER KILLS HIM
THE ORDINARY PIKE COUNTY DIALECT
 SAYS I TO MYSELF NOW HE'LL THROW UP THE SPONGETHERE AIN'T NO MORE USE
 BUT I COULDN'T COME TO NOTHING
ALL READYSHOVE OFF I COULDN'T HARDLY HANG ON TO THE SHUTTERS I WAS SO WEAK
 BUT THERE WARN'T NO GETTING AWAY YOU KNOW
CHAPTER XXXIV
CHAPTER XXXIV
AND AT LAST THE LAWYER SPEAKS UP AND SAYS
THE WATERS THAT CLEANSE IS FREE THE DOOR OF HEAVEN STANDS OPENOH ENTER IN AND BE AT REST A-A-MEN
 WHEN WE WAS TEN FOOT OFF TOM WHISPERED TO ME AND WANTED TO TIE JIM TO THE TREE FOR FUN
 I CROSSED OVER TO THAT SIDE AND WATCHED THEM
I'LL REST A WHILE I RECKON AND GO ON
 WE LAID OFF ALL THE AFTERNOON IN THE WOODS TALKING AND ME READING THE BOOKS AND HAVING A GENERAL GOOD TIME
 DIDN HE JIS DIS MINUTE SING OUT LIKE HE KNOWED YOU TOM SAYS IN A PUZZLED-UP KIND OF WAY
 DO YOU RECKON YOU CAN LEARN EM ANYTHING
I COULDN'T SEE BUT A LITTLE WAYS BUT I WENT POKING ALONG OVER ROUGH GROUND FOR A QUARTER OF A MILE OR MORE AND THEN I RUN ACROSS A BIG OLD-FASHIONED DOUBLE LOG-HOUSE BEFORE I NOTICED IT
 THE TWO YOUNG MEN LOOKED DARK BUT NEVER SAID NOTHING
 THEN THE CAPTAIN SUNG OUT
 SO THEN THEY PUT IT ON HIM YOU SEE
 I JUDGED THE OLD MAN WOULD TURN UP AGAIN BY AND BY THOUGH I WISHED HE WOULDN'T
AND MIND YOU IT WAS A THING THAT WAS CALCULATED TO MAKE MOST ANYBODY SQUSH TO GET FETCHED SUCH A SOLID ONE AS THAT WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BECAUSE HOW WAS HE GOING TO KNOW WHAT WAS TATTOOED ON THE MAN
 OF COURSE HE WOULD A THROWED MORE STYLE INTO IT BUT I CAN'T DO THAT VERY HANDY NOT BEING BRUNG UP TO IT
 DAT WUZ DE SMARTES DODGE
 SO SHE RUN ON
I HAIN'T GOT NUFFN BUT DISH YER OLE SHIRT EN YOU KNOWS I GOT TO KEEP DE JOURNAL ON DAT OH YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND JIM
 YOU GOT ANYTHING TO PLAY MUSIC ON I AIN GOT NUFFN BUT A COASE COMB EN A PIECE O PAPER EN A JUICE-HARP
YOU BETTER A BLAME SIGHT GIVE YOURSELF A GOOD CUSSING FOR YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S ENTITLED TO IT MOST
 AND IF SHE TURNED OVER AND FOUND ONE IN BED SHE WOULD SCRAMBLE OUT AND LIFT A HOWL THAT YOU WOULD THINK THE HOUSE WAS AFIRE
DAT'S JIST WHAT DEY IS
 SO WE SHORTENED UP ONE OF THE CALICO GOWNS AND I TURNED UP MY TROUSER-LEGS TO MY KNEES AND GOT INTO IT
 THE RIVER WAS A MILE WIDE THERE AND IT ALWAYS LOOKS PRETTY ON A SUMMER MORNINGSO I WAS HAVING A GOOD ENOUGH TIME SEEING THEM HUNT FOR MY REMAINDERS IF I ONLY HAD A BITE TO EAT
 HE SAID IF I'D A WANTED IT TO HIDE A KNIFE IN AND SMUGGLE IT TO JIM TO KILL THE SENESKAL WITH IT WOULD A BEEN ALL RIGHT
 THEY TOOK AND SHOVED THE BAG THROUGH A RIP IN THE STRAW TICK THAT WAS UNDER THE FEATHER-BED AND CRAMMED IT IN A FOOT OR TWO AMONGST THE STRAW AND SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE A NIGGER ONLY MAKES UP THE FEATHER-BED AND DON'T TURN OVER THE STRAW TICK ONLY ABOUT TWICE A YEAR AND SO IT WARN'T IN NO DANGER OF GETTING STOLE NOW
WHY I COULDN'T A THOUGHT OF THEM IN A YEAR
 I SAID WHY COULDN'T WE SEE THEM THEN
 THE NEXT MINUTE HE WHIRLS ON ME AND SAYS
 ASK HIM TO SHOW UP
SLIP OFF YOUR CHAIN AND THERE YOU ARE
 THIS IS ST PETERSBURG
 UPSTAIRS THE HALL WAS DARK BUT I FOUND THE DUKE'S ROOM AND STARTED TO PAW AROUND IT WITH MY HANDS
 THEY STOOD OPEN BUT THERE WARN'T NOTHING LEFT IN THEM THAT WAS ANY ACCOUNT
 SO I GOT ALL MY TRAPS INTO MY CANOE AGAIN SO AS TO HAVE THEM OUT OF SIGHT AND I PUT OUT THE FIRE AND SCATTERED THE ASHES AROUND TO LOOK LIKE AN OLD LAST YEAR'S CAMP AND THEN CLUMB A TREE
BUT WE THOUGHT WE HEARD THEM ON THE WATER SO WE GOT A CANOE AND TOOK OUT AFTER THEM AND CROSSED OVER BUT COULDN'T FIND NOTHING OF THEM
IT'S A GOOD IDEA
 I THINK I SEE
AND IT WARN'T NO SLOUCH OF A GRINDSTONE NUTHER
I WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOUTHE SIX THOUSAND AND ALL HE LOOKED SURPRISED
S'POSE YOU'D A DONE RIGHT AND GIVE JIM UP WOULD YOU FELT BETTER THAN WHAT YOU DO NOW
 THERE WAS A BIG STEAMBOAT LAYING AT THE SHORE AWAY UP UNDER THE POINT ABOUT THREE MILE ABOVE THE TOWNBEEN THERE A COUPLE OF HOURS TAKING ON FREIGHT
WHAT MIGHT YOUR NAME BE SARAH WILLIAMS WHERE BOUTS DO YOU LIVE
 HE ABUSED ME A LITTLE FOR BEING SO SLOW
 JIM SAID HE BET SHE DID THINK OF IT BY THE TIME THE MEN WAS READY TO START AND HE BELIEVED THEY MUST A GONE UP-TOWN TO GET A DOG AND SO THEY LOST ALL THAT TIME OR ELSE WE WOULDN'T BE HERE ON A TOWHEAD SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN MILE BELOW THE VILLAGENO INDEEDY WE WOULD BE IN THAT SAME OLD TOWN AGAIN
 SEE
AND WE WOULD PUT SMALL THINGS IN UNCLE'S COAT-POCKETS AND HE MUST STEAL THEM OUT
THE RIVER ROAD'S A ROCKY ONE AND YOUR FEET'LL BE IN A CONDITION WHEN YOU GET TO GOSHEN I RECKON I WENT UP THE BANK ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AND THEN I DOUBLED ON MY TRACKS AND SLIPPED BACK TO WHERE MY CANOE WAS A GOOD PIECE BELOW THE HOUSE
AND TOLD HIM WHAT THEY WOULD BE AND WHAT THEY WAS FOR
DID YOU EVER SEE THE KING WHO
BY AND BY HE ROLLED OUT AND JUMPED UP ON HIS FEET LOOKING WILD AND HE SEE ME AND WENT FOR ME
WE CAN GET HIM SOME CAN'T NOBODY READ HIS PLATES THAT AIN'T GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT HUCK FINN
AND I STOLE IT TO GIVE TO YOU
THE DOOR SLAMMED TO BECAUSE IT WAS ON THE CAREENED SIDE
 THAT MULEHEADED OLD FOOL WOULDN'T GIVE IN THEN
I HADN'T HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE NO WAY
 WELL I NEVER SEE THE BEAT OF IT IN MY BORN DAYS
 THAT SOUNDED PRETTY REASONABLE SO I DIDN'T SAY NO MORE
 SHE WAS GENTLE AND SWEET LIKE A DOVE AND SHE WAS ONLY TWENTY
A KIND OF COLD SHIVER WENT THROUGH ME AND THEN I STRUCK OUT FOR HER
 THESE YER ORPHANS LL GIT THEIR HOUSE BACK AGIN AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR THEM
 THE WATER WAS THREE OR FOUR FOOT DEEP ON THE ISLAND IN THE LOW PLACES AND ON THE ILLINOIS BOTTOM
N AS FOR THE NIGGERS THAT WROTE IT I LOW I'D TAKE N LASH M T'LL PEOPLE TO HELP HIM BROTHER MARPLES
 JIM SAID WE COULD TAKE DECK PASSAGE ON A STEAMBOAT NOW AND THE MONEY WOULD LAST US AS FAR AS WE WANTED TO GO IN THE FREE STATES
 BEING MADE OF A WHOLE SHEET THAT WAY THERE WAS ROPE ENOUGH FOR FORTY PIES IF WE'D A WANTED THEM AND PLENTY LEFT OVER FOR SOUP OR SAUSAGE OR ANYTHING YOU CHOOSE
 I WISH WE'D A HAD THE HANDLING OF LOUIS XVI THERE WOULDN'T A BEEN NO SON OF SAINT LOUIS ASCEND TO HEAVEN WROTE DOWN IN HIS BIOGRAPHY
BUT AT LAST THERE WAS A BIG ONE AND THEY HAILED HER
 AND SO WE WENT FOR THE SNAKES AND GRABBED A COUPLE OF DOZEN GARTERS AND HOUSE-SNAKES AND PUT THEM IN A BAG AND PUT IT IN OUR ROOM AND BY THAT TIME IT WAS SUPPER-TIME AND A RATTLING GOOD HONEST DAY'S WORK
 WHY ME
I SPEC I AIN'T EVER GWYNE TO SEE YOU NO MO NO MO  HE WAS A MIGHTY GOOD NIGGER JIM WAS
 THERE IS WAYS TO KEEP OFF SOME KINDS OF BAD LUCK BUT THIS WASN'T ONE OF THEM KIND
 I FEEL MIGHTY MEAN TO LEAVE YOU
AND I'LL ACKNOWLEDGE CANDID AND FRANK I AIN'T VERY WELL FIXED TO MEET IT AND ANSWER IT
 I HAD IT BECAUSE I STOLE IT FROM THEM
 ASK BILL MAYBE BILL HE GIVES HIM A CHAW
 BUT I LAY YOU AIN'T A-GOIN TO THREATEN NOBODY ANY MORE JIM TURNER
 SOMETIMES YOU GWYNE TO GIT HURT EN SOMETIMES YOU GWYNE TO GIT SICK
DERN YOUR SKIN AIN'T THE COMPANY GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU SAYS THE BALDHEAD PRETTY PERT AND UPPISH
 SOME FOLKS THINK THE NIGGER AIN'T FAR FROM HERE
THEN THE KING BEGINS TO WORK HIS JAW AGAIN AND SAYS HOW HIM AND HIS NIECES WOULD BE GLAD IF A FEW OF THE MAIN PRINCIPAL FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY WOULD TAKE SUPPER HERE WITH THEM THIS EVENING AND HELP SET UP WITH THE ASHES OF THE DISEASED
IN THE MORNING WE WENT UP TO THE VILLAGE AND BOUGHT A WIRE RAT-TRAP AND FETCHED IT DOWN AND UNSTOPPED THE BEST RAT-HOLE AND IN ABOUT AN HOUR WE HAD FIFTEEN OF THE BULLIEST KIND OF ONES
AND SHE WOULD SQUEEZE MY HAND OR MAYBE KISS ME AND TELL ME TO SAY IT AGAIN AND KEEP ON SAYING IT BECAUSE IT DONE HER GOOD AND SHE WAS IN SO MUCH TROUBLE
AND TIED UP THE CANOE AND WENT TO SLEEP AND NEVER WAKED UP TILL ABOUT AN HOUR AGO
 I BEN A-BUYIN POTS EN PANS EN VITTLES AS I GOT A CHANST EN A-PATCHIN UP DE RAF NIGHTS WHEN WHAT RAFT JIM OUR OLE RAF YOU MEAN TO SAY OUR OLD RAFT WARN'T SMASHED ALL TO FLINDERS NO SHE WARN'T
AND THEN YOU KEPT TOM HERE SO LONG WITH THE BUTTER IN HIS HAT THAT YOU COME NEAR SPILING THE WHOLE BUSINESS BECAUSE THE MEN COME BEFORE WE WAS OUT OF THE CABIN AND WE HAD TO RUSH AND THEY HEARD US AND LET DRIVE AT US AND I GOT MY SHARE AND WE DODGED OUT OF THE PATH AND LET THEM GO BY AND WHEN THE DOGS COME THEY WARN'T INTERESTED IN US BUT WENT FOR THE MOST NOISE AND WE GOT OUR CANOE AND MADE FOR THE RAFT AND WAS ALL SAFE AND JIM WAS A FREE MAN AND WE DONE IT ALL BY OURSELVES AND WASN'T IT BULLY AUNTY WELL I NEVER HEARD THE LIKES OF IT IN ALL MY BORN DAYS
AND EVERY WINDOW ALONG THE ROAD WAS FULL OF WOMEN'S HEADS AND THERE WAS NIGGER BOYS IN EVERY TREE AND BUCKS AND WENCHES LOOKING OVER EVERY FENCE
 WE COULD A HAD A WHOLE DINNER
2
 WE COULD HEAR THEM BECAUSE THEY WORE BOOTS AND YELLED BUT WE DIDN'T WEAR NO BOOTS AND DIDN'T YELL
 SO I CLUMB UP EN LAID DOWN ON DE PLANKS
 THAT WARN'T USUAL
WON'T AMOUNT TO NOTHINGWON'T BE NOTHING TO IT WELL AS FOR ME TOM THAT'S THE WAY I'D LIKE SHUCKS HE SAYS AND LOOKED DISGUSTED
 NOW I WANT TO AST YOU
 I DIDN'T LOOK AROUND BUT I KINDER FELT LIKE HE WAS WATCHING ME
 WE'S DOIN BLAME WELL EN WE BETTER LET BLAME WELL ALONE AS DE GOOD BOOK SAYS
AND HERE AM I FORLORN TORN FROM MY HIGH ESTATE HUNTED OF MEN DESPISED BY THE COLD WORLD RAGGED WORN HEART-BROKEN AND DEGRADED TO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF FELONS ON A RAFT JIM PITIED HIM EVER SO MUCH AND SO DID I
 I TOLD HIM THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT SO HE COME ABOARD
 SHE TOLD ME THE WIDOW HEY?AND WHO TOLD THE WIDOW SHE COULD PUT IN HER SHOVEL ABOUT A THING THAT AIN'T NONE OF HER BUSINESS NOBODY NEVER TOLD HER WELL I'LL LEARN HER HOW TO MEDDLE
I WENT TO SLEEP AND JIM DIDN'T CALL ME WHEN IT WAS MY TURN
 YOUR UNCLE SILAS KNOWED A FAMILY IN BATON ROUGE THAT KNOWED HIS PEOPLE VERY WELL
THEN TOM HE CARRIED THE SACK INTO THE LEAN-TO WHILST I STOOD OFF A PIECE TO KEEP WATCH
WHEN I GOT HALF-WAY FIRST ONE HOUND AND THEN ANOTHER GOT UP AND WENT FOR ME AND OF COURSE I STOPPED AND FACED THEM AND KEPT STILL
AND BY AND BY ALL HANDS DROPPED THE REINS AND EVERY LADY PUT HER KNUCKLES ON HER HIPS AND EVERY GENTLEMAN FOLDED HIS ARMS AND THEN HOW THE HORSES DID LEAN OVER AND HUMP THEMSELVES
SO WE WENT ALONG DURING THREE HOURS AND MORE
 THEN THERE WAS A RUSH AND A BANG BANG BANG AND THE BULLETS FAIRLY WHIZZED AROUND US
 THE MAN CAME A-PAWING ALONG IN THE DARK AND WHEN PACKARD GOT TO MY STATEROOM HE SAYS
 I SAYS ALL RIGHT AND WAS GOING TO START FOR THE RAFT
 JIM WAS AWFUL DISAPPOINTED BUT I SAID NEVER MIND CAIRO WOULD BE THE NEXT PLACE I RECKONED
SO I LOOKED THROUGH THE CRACK AND EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT
BLAME IT I'D SORTER BEGUN TO THINK YOU WASN'T
IN THE MORNING WE WAS UP AT BREAK OF DAY AND DOWN TO THE NIGGER CABINS TO PET THE DOGS AND MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE NIGGER THAT FED JIMIF IT WAS JIM THAT WAS BEING FED
 THEY'D HAD ALL THE DOGS SHUT UP SO THEY WOULDN'T SCARE OFF THE ROBBERS
GO BEFORE BREAKFAST WHY WHAT DID YOU RECKON I WANTED YOU TO GO AT ALL FOR MISS MARY WELL I NEVER THOUGHTAND COME TO THINK I DON'T KNOW
BECAUSE HE WARN'T ONLY JUST A FARMER HE WAS A PREACHER TOO AND HAD A LITTLE ONE-HORSE LOG CHURCH DOWN BACK OF THE PLANTATION WHICH HE BUILT IT HIMSELF AT HIS OWN EXPENSE FOR A CHURCH AND SCHOOLHOUSE AND NEVER CHARGED NOTHING FOR HIS PREACHING AND IT WAS WORTH IT TOO
 WHY LOOKY HERE
 WHY LOOKY HERE
 AND AFTER SUPPER HE TALKED TO HIM ABOUT TEMPERANCE AND SUCH THINGS TILL THE OLD MAN CRIED AND SAID HE'D BEEN A FOOL AND FOOLED AWAY HIS LIFE
AND IT WAS THE WORST MIXED-UP THING YOU EVER SEE
 AND AFTER A MINUTE HE SAYS
 YOU GOT TO STAY ALWAYS
 I RECKONED HE BELIEVED IN THE A-RABS AND THE ELEPHANTS BUT AS FOR ME I THINK DIFFERENT
 LE'S DUCK EM
 NOBODY DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THE THINGS THEY BUY TILL A WHOLE DAY AFTER THE AUCTION ON ACCOUNTS OF THE SHORT NOTICE AND THEY AIN'T GOING OUT OF THIS TILL THEY GET THAT MONEY
MISS MARY JANE IS THERE ANY PLACE OUT OF TOWN A LITTLE WAYS WHERE YOU COULD GO AND STAY THREE OR FOUR DAYS YES
THE IDEA OF YOU LYNCHING ANYBODY
 SO THEN SHE LOOKED A LITTLE BETTER SATISFIED AND SAYS
 WHY HUCK IF IT WAS TO DO OVER AGAIN I BET I COULD FETCH TWO HUNDRED
HOW WE SET THE RUNAWAY NIGGER FREEME AND TOM GOOD LAND
 ASKS ME TO INVITE EVERYBODY TO COME TO THE FUNERALWANTS ME TO MAKE EM ALL WELCOME
 ONE MAN ASKED ME IF I SEE THE NIGGERS STEAL IT
 I FOUND PLENTY STRAWBERRIES RIPE AND PRIME
 TOO MUCH LIKE JEWELRY
 HE'S TOLD SOME STRETCHERS I RECKON AND I SAID I WOULDN'T SWALLOW IT ALL
 EVERYBODY SAYS WHY DOCTOR AND ABNER SHACKLEFORD SAYS
COME NOW WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME WHWHAT MUM WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME
 GOING TO FEED THE DOGS THE NIGGER KIND OF SMILED AROUND GRADUALLY OVER HIS FACE LIKE WHEN YOU HEAVE A BRICKBAT IN A MUD-PUDDLE AND HE SAYS
AND THEN I SLIPPED DOWN THE LADDER
SO COMING DOWN THE RIVER ME AND TOM THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A FIRST-RATE SURPRISE FOR HIM TO COME HERE TO THE HOUSE FIRST AND FOR ME TO BY AND BY TAG ALONG AND DROP IN AND LET ON TO BE A STRANGER
PACKARD DIDN'T TAKE NO NOTICE OF THAT BUT HUNG UP HIS LANTERN ON A NAIL AND STARTED TOWARDS WHERE I WAS THERE IN THE DARK AND MOTIONED BILL TO COME
 I SEE THE COFFIN LID WAS THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE BUT I DASN'T GO TO LOOK IN UNDER IT WITH FOLKS AROUND
 AND HE SAID OF COURSE HIM AND WILLIAM WOULD TAKE THE GIRLS HOME WITH THEM
 YOU JES TAKE EN LOOK AT IT A MINUTE
BUT I WON'T LET TO-MORROW GO BY WITHOUT STOPPING UP THEM HOLES OH I WOULDN'T HURRY
 I DIDN'T MIND THE LICKINGS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T AMOUNT TO NOTHING
BUT WHEN HE STOPPED THAT WAY AND BEGUN TO STUDY AND THINK AGAIN I RECKONED HE WAS CHANGING HIS MIND
 WOULD HE SAY DAT
 HE GROANED AND MOANED AND THRASHED AROUND THIS WAY AND THAT FOR A LONG TIME
WE GOT TO DIG IN LIKE ALL GIT-OUT WELL ANYWAY I SAYS WHAT'S SOME OF IT
 THAT AIN'T NO SORT OF STYLE
 IT DIDN'T SEEM NO GOOD FOR ME TO STAYI COULDN'T DO NOTHING AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE HUNG IF I COULD GET AWAY
AFTERWARDS JIM SAID THE WITCHES BE WITCHED HIM AND PUT HIM IN A TRANCE AND RODE HIM ALL OVER THE STATE AND THEN SET HIM UNDER THE TREES AGAIN AND HUNG HIS HAT ON A LIMB TO SHOW WHO DONE IT
THEATER-ACTORTRAGEDY YOU KNOW
 THERE IN THE PALACE AT SHEFFIELD THEY'VE GOT FURNACES AND HE WANTS HIS WATER HOT
MISS MARY JANE YOU CAN'T A-BEAR TO SEE PEOPLE IN TROUBLE AND I CAN'TMOST ALWAYS
 LOOK AT THAT-AIR GRINDSTONE S'I
AND ME AND SILAS AND MY SID AND TOM ON THE CONSTANT WATCH DAY AND NIGHT AS I WAS A-TELLING YOU AND NOT A ONE OF US COULD CATCH HIDE NOR HAIR NOR SIGHT NOR SOUND OF THEM
 JIM ALLOWED THEY'D GOT SPOILED AND WAS HOVE OUT OF THE NEST
 ONE MAN SAID IT WAS GETTING TOWARDS THE LONG DAYS AND THE SHORT NIGHTS NOW
 AND THEN SOMETHING STRUCK ME
SHOOTING'S GOOD BUT THERE'S QUIETER WAYS IF THE THING'S GOT TO BE DONE
 I STUCK TIGHT TO THE WALL AND KEPT MIGHTY STILL THOUGH QUIVERY
FOR MY BROTHER AND ME HAS HAD MISFORTUNES
 THERE AIN'T NECESSITY ENOUGH IN THIS CASE
 SO THE DUKE SAID THESE ARKANSAW LUNKHEADS COULDN'T COME UP TO SHAKESPEARE
 I DON'T BLAME YOU GENTLEMENFAR FROM IT
 SO THE DUKE AND THE KING WENT TO OVERHAULING OUR WIGWAM TO SEE WHAT THE BEDS WAS LIKE
NOT LIKE ANOTHER MAN'S WHITE BUT A WHITE TO MAKE A BODY SICK A WHITE TO MAKE A BODY'S FLESH CRAWLA TREE-TOAD WHITE A FISH-BELLY WHITE
IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TOM'S WAGON DROVE UP TO THE FRONT STILE AND AUNT SALLY SHE SEE IT THROUGH THE WINDOW BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AND SAYS
 YOU WANT TO SET ON YOUR BED NIGHTS BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP AND EARLY IN THE MORNINGS AND PLAY YOUR JEWS-HARP
 BUT TOWARDS DAYLIGHT WE GOT IT ALL SETTLED SATISFACTORY AND CONCLUDED TO DROP CRABAPPLES AND P'SIMMONS
BUT WHENEVER ONE WAS TALKING AND LETTING ON TO KNOW ALL ABOUT SUCH THINGS JIM WOULD HAPPEN IN AND SAY HM
 THEY DON'T THINK NOTHING OF PULLING A SHOT-TOWER UP BY THE ROOTS AND BELTING A SUNDAY-SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT OVER THE HEAD WITH ITOR ANY OTHER MAN WHO MAKES THEM TEAR AROUND SO WHY WHOEVER RUBS THE LAMP OR THE RING
 THAT OLD FOOL HAD MADE A TRADE AND GOT FORTY DOLLARS AND WHEN WE FOUND HIM IN THE DOGGERY THE LOAFERS HAD MATCHED HALF-DOLLARS WITH HIM AND GOT EVERY CENT BUT WHAT HE'D SPENT FOR WHISKY
 OF COURSE THEY WILL
 THEY STARTED RIDING TOWARDS THE STORE
DON'T BE NO ROUGHER ON HIM THAN YOU'RE OBLEEGED TO BECAUSE HE AIN'T A BAD NIGGER
AND THE KING SAYS
 A MAN UP AND OFFERED ME TEN CENTS TO HELP HIM PULL A SKIFF OVER THE RIVER AND BACK TO FETCH A SHEEP AND SO I WENT ALONG
SUCH A TOWN AS THAT HAS TO BE ALWAYS MOVING BACK AND BACK AND BACK BECAUSE THE RIVER'S ALWAYS GNAWING AT IT
SO WE ALL STARTED
 I HAIN'T EVER SEEN HER SINCE THAT TIME THAT I SEE HER GO OUT OF THAT DOOR
 I CALLED IT BORROWING BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT PAP ALWAYS CALLED IT
 PRETTY SOON I MADE IT OUT
HE WAS MOST FIFTY AND HE LOOKED IT
 I PRACTICED AROUND ALL DAY TO GET THE HANG OF THE THINGS AND BY AND BY I COULD DO PRETTY WELL IN THEM ONLY JIM SAID I DIDN'T WALK LIKE A GIRL
 WE ASKED SOME STRAGGLERS ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID EVERYBODY WENT TO THE SHOW LOOKING VERY INNOCENT
AND WE HAD TO USE UP THREE WASH-PANS FULL OF FLOUR BEFORE WE GOT THROUGH AND WE GOT BURNT PRETTY MUCH ALL OVER IN PLACES AND EYES PUT OUT WITH THE SMOKE
 HE SAID WE MUSTN'T TALK ANY MORE THAN WE COULD HELP AND THEN TALK MIGHTY LOW
I'M THE SERVANT-GIRL
IT'S A MOST AMAZ'N GOOD IDEA DUKEYOU HAVE GOT A RATTLIN CLEVER HEAD ON YOU SAYS THE KING
 I COULDN'T GET UP THE CHIMBLY
AND WOULDN'T BELIEVE SHE'D COUNTED THEM RIGHT IF SHE DID
 SO HE'S GOT HIS SHARE O THE CASH YET WELL THEN COME ALONG
 IT WAS IN THERE WHEN YOU WAS CRYING THERE AWAY IN THE NIGHT
 AND I ORTER TOOA MEAN SKUNK THE MAN ON THE FLOOR WOULD SHRIVEL UP AND SAY OH PLEASE DON'T BILL
 SPECIALLY PAINFUL MUSIC
 SHE STOOPED DOWN QUICK AT THE FOOT OF THE BED AND GIVE ME A PULL AND OUT I COME
LOOKY HEREDO YOU THINK YOU'D VENTURE TO BLOW ON US
 THAT LAW TRIAL WAS A SLOW BUSINESSAPPEARED LIKE THEY WARN'T EVER GOING TO GET STARTED ON IT
AND YOU TURN BACK AND FOOL ALONG SLOW SO AS TO GET TO THE HOUSE ABOUT THE TIME YOU OUGHT TO
 YOU COULD EASY SEE THAT SOMETHING HAD BEEN DRAGGED OVER THE GROUND
 JIM WAS SATISFIED
 THEY ALL CROWDED UP AND LEANED OVER THE RAILS NEARLY IN MY FACE AND KEPT STILL WATCHING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
 WE WENT OUT WITH THE SKIFF AND TOWED IT ASHORE
FOR I'D NOTICED THAT PROVIDENCE ALWAYS DID PUT THE RIGHT WORDS IN MY MOUTH IF I LEFT IT ALONE
 YOU CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING ON HIM YOU KNOW
 BUT I SOON GIVE UP THAT NOTION FOR TWO THINGS
 I JUDGED I'D HIDE HER GOOD AND THEN STEAD OF TAKING TO THE WOODS WHEN I RUN OFF I'D GO DOWN THE RIVER ABOUT FIFTY MILE AND CAMP IN ONE PLACE FOR GOOD AND NOT HAVE SUCH A ROUGH TIME TRAMPING ON FOOT
 THERE WAS SOMETHING LAYING ON THE FLOOR IN THE FAR CORNER THAT LOOKED LIKE A MAN
 EVERY NOW AND THEN I STOPPED A SECOND AMONGST THE THICK LEAVES AND LISTENED BUT MY BREATH COME SO HARD I COULDN'T HEAR NOTHING ELSE
 YOU TAKE A MAN DAT'S GOT ON'Y ONE OR TWO CHILLEN
THEY'VE GOT A GOOD THING HERE AND THEY AIN'T A-GOING TO LEAVE TILL THEY'VE PLAYED THIS FAMILY AND THIS TOWN FOR ALL THEY'RE WORTH SO I'LL FIND A CHANCE TIME ENOUGH
WELL I SEE THE NIGGERS GO IN THERE SEVERAL TIMES BOTH OF THEM GAVE A LITTLE JUMP AND LOOKED LIKE THEY HADN'T EVER EXPECTED IT AND THEN LIKE THEY HAD
 WE CATCHED FISH AND TALKED AND WE TOOK A SWIM NOW AND THEN TO KEEP OFF SLEEPINESS
 WELL HERE'S YOUR BAD LUCK
AND AS WE STRUCK INTO THE TOWN AND UP THROUGH THE THE MIDDLE OF IT--IT WAS AS MUCH AS HALF-AFTER EIGHT THENHERE COMES A RAGING RUSH OF PEOPLE WITH TORCHES AND AN AWFUL WHOOPING AND YELLING AND BANGING TIN PANS AND BLOWING HORNS
 I HAIN'T EVER BEEN HERE BEFORE
BUT WHEN THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS A STATE IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE THEY'D LET THAT NIGGER VOTE I DRAWED OUT
 OTHER PLACES DO SEEM SO CRAMPED UP AND SMOTHERY BUT A RAFT DON'T
SO WE SLID IN THERE AND GOT THREE CANDLES AND TOM LAID FIVE CENTS ON THE TABLE FOR PAY
WHAT A MESS YOU ARE ALWAYS MAKING  THE WIDOW PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR ME BUT THAT WARN'T GOING TO KEEP OFF THE BAD LUCK I KNOWED THAT WELL ENOUGH
 HE CAME IN GAPING AND DIGGING ONE FIST INTO HIS EYES AND HE WAS DRAGGING A GUN ALONG WITH THE OTHER ONE
 WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?LAY AROUND THERE TILL HE LETS THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG
 HE LOOKED ASTONISHED AND SAYS
AND NOT TO BE THE LEAST AFRAID BECAUSE WE WOULD SEE HE GOT AWAY SURE
CUSS THE DOCTOR
 IT'S HIS HAND YOU'VE GOT THERE NOT MINE WELL SAYS THE LAWYER THIS IS A STATE OF THINGS
WHEN WE WAS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YARDS DOWN-STREAM WE SEE THE LANTERN SHOW LIKE A LITTLE SPARK AT THE TEXAS DOOR FOR A SECOND AND WE KNOWED BY THAT THAT THE RASCALS HAD MISSED THEIR BOAT AND WAS BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WAS IN JUST AS MUCH TROUBLE NOW AS JIM TURNER WAS
 IF A BOAT WAS TO COME ALONG WE WAS GOING TO TAKE TO THE CANOE AND BREAK FOR THE ILLINOIS SHORE
 YOU CAN'T PRAY A LIEI FOUND THAT OUT
I DID HONEST
 THEN HE WORKED ALL DAY FIXING THINGS IN BUNDLES AND GETTING ALL READY TO QUIT RAFTING
AUNT SALLY JUMPED FOR HER AND MOST HUGGED THE HEAD OFF OF HER AND CRIED OVER HER AND I FOUND A GOOD ENOUGH PLACE FOR ME UNDER THE BED FOR IT WAS GETTING PRETTY SULTRY FOR US SEEMED TO ME
 IF YOU ARE WITH THE QUALITY OR AT A FUNERAL OR TRYING TO GO TO SLEEP WHEN YOU AIN'T SLEEPYIF YOU ARE ANYWHERES WHERE IT WON'T DO FOR YOU TO SCRATCH WHY YOU WILL ITCH ALL OVER IN UPWARDS OF A THOUSAND PLACES
 I HAD MY TWENTY-DOLLAR GOLD PIECE AND SOME OTHER MONEY BUT I RECKONED I BETTER SAVE IT BECAUSE THERE AIN'T NO TELLING HOW SOON YOU ARE GOING TO NEED IT AWAY FROM HOME AND AMONGST STRANGERS THAT WAY
 THERE WAS A LITTLE OLD PIANO TOO THAT HAD TIN PANS IN IT I RECKON AND NOTHING WAS EVER SO LOVELY AS TO HEAR THE YOUNG LADIES SING THE LAST LINK IS BROKEN AND PLAY THE BATTLE OF PRAGUE ON IT
 BUT ONLY ABOUT A MINUTE
 IT LAYS IN DE WAY SOLLERMUN WAS RAISED
 DEN I WAS GWYNE TO SWIM TO DE RAF AGIN WHEN DEY WAS GONE
PLEASE TO DON'T POKE FUN AT A POOR GIRL LIKE ME MUM
THE HOUSE ALL DARKWHICH MADE ME FEEL SORRY AND DISAPPOINTED I DIDN'T KNOW WHY
WE SEE WE WAS TOO LATECOULDN'T DO NO GOOD
LOOKY HERE BILGEWATER HE SAYS I'M NATION SORRY FOR YOU BUT YOU AIN'T THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S HAD TROUBLES LIKE THAT NO NO YOU AIN'T
 WHEN WE WAS OUT OF SIGHT OF THE HOUSE HE LOOKED BACK AND AROUND A SECOND AND THEN COMES A-RUNNING AND SAYS
EN WHEN I COME BACK DAH WAS DAT DO A-STANNIN OPEN YIT EN DAT CHILE STANNIN MOS RIGHT IN IT A-LOOKIN DOWN AND MOURNIN EN DE TEARS RUNNIN DOWN
 I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO SLEEP OF COURSE
THE WIDOWS MOSES AND THE BULRUSHERS MISS WATSON HUCK STEALING AWAY THEY TIP-TOED ALONG JIM TOM SAWYER'S BAND OF ROBBERS   HUCK CREEPS INTO HIS WINDOW MISS WATSON'S LECTURE THE ROBBERS DISPERSED RUBBING THE LAMP
I TOOK THE WATCH AND JIM HE LAID DOWN AND SNORED AWAY
 WHY WE COULD WORK WITH A TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION IF WE WANTED TO I BELIEVE
 ALL WE NEEDED WAS JUST ENOUGH FOR THE PIE AND SO WE THROWED THE REST AWAY
 AND HE SAID IT WOULD MAKE US ALL CELEBRATED THAT HAD A HAND IN IT
IT AIN'T A BIT OF TROUBLE TO US NOT A BIT IN THE WORLD
 WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH EM THEY'RETHEY'REARE YOU THE WATCHMAN OF THE BOAT YES HE SAYS KIND OF PRETTY-WELL-SATISFIED LIKE
 WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS GEORGE JACKSON SIR
 _I'LL TAKE IT OUT OF YOU
 THE JUDGE SAID HE COULD HUG HIM FOR THEM WORDS
 AUNT POLLYTOM'S AUNT POLLY SHE ISAND MARY AND THE WIDOW DOUGLAS IS ALL TOLD ABOUT IN THAT BOOK WHICH IS MOSTLY A TRUE BOOK WITH SOME STRETCHERS AS I SAID BEFORE
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN OH HE SAYS
AFTER SUPPER SHE GOT OUT HER BOOK AND LEARNED ME ABOUT MOSES AND THE BULRUSHERS AND I WAS IN A SWEAT TO FIND OUT ALL ABOUT HIM
 NO-SIRREE-_BOB THEY AIN'T NO TROUBLE BOUT THAT SPECULATION YOU BET YOU
 THE CHAIN FELL DOWN AND WE OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT IN AND SHUT IT AND STRUCK A MATCH AND SEE THE SHED WAS ONLY BUILT AGAINST A CABIN AND HADN'T NO CONNECTION WITH IT
AND NEVER THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT REFORMING
 I WAS ITCHING IN ELEVEN DIFFERENT PLACES NOW
 AND DON'T YOU LOOK WHEN JIM UNLOADS THE PANSOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT
BUT I MINDED THE TROUBLE WE HAD TO LAY IN ANOTHER LOT
 EVERYBODY WAS SHOCKED
THAT PLEASED THE OLD MAN TILL HE COULDN'T REST
BECAUSE YOU SEE WE DIDN'T WANT NOTHING BUT A CRUST AND WE COULDN'T PROP IT UP RIGHT AND SHE WOULD ALWAYS CAVE IN
 LIKE AS NOT DEY'S A WATCHMAN ON DAT WRACK WATCHMAN YOUR GRANDMOTHER I SAYS
 BUT I DIDN'T DO IT STRAIGHT OFF BUT LAID THE PAPER DOWN AND SET THERE THINKINGTHINKING HOW GOOD IT WAS ALL THIS HAPPENED SO AND HOW NEAR I COME TO BEING LOST AND GOING TO HELL
AT LAST SHE COME AND BEGUN TO ASK ME QUESTIONS BUT I COULDN'T ANSWER THEM STRAIGHT I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH END OF ME WAS UP
HE'S BROKE HIS ARM AND OUR BAGGAGE GOT PUT OFF AT A TOWN ABOVE HERE LAST NIGHT IN THE NIGHT BY A MISTAKE
 EN MO EN DAT I DOAN WANT HIM TO SLEEP WID ME JIM DON'T ACT SO FOOLISH
 IT WARN'T ANY GOOD TO ME WITHOUT HOOKS
 YOU SEE WHEN WE LEFT HIM ALL ALONE WE HAD TO TIE HIM BECAUSE IF ANYBODY HAPPENED ON TO HIM ALL BY HIMSELF AND NOT TIED IT WOULDN'T LOOK MUCH LIKE HE WAS A RUNAWAY NIGGER YOU KNOW
 I BEGGED AND TOLD HIM I WAS ONLY HUCK
 I WAS MIGHTY DOWNHEARTED
 SO I WENT BACK
WE SHOT A WATER-FOWL NOW AND THEN THAT GOT UP TOO EARLY IN THE MORNING OR DIDN'T GO TO BED EARLY ENOUGH IN THE EVENING
NOBODY STIRRED AND THERE WARN'T NO MORE LAUGHING
BECAUSE THESE MEN WAS IN SUCH A FIDGET NOW THAT SOME WAS WANTING TO START RIGHT NOW AND LAY FOR THEM DESPERADOES AND SAYING IT WARN'T BUT A FEW MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT
 BUT I WARN YOU ALL THAT A TIME S COMING WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL SICK WHENEVER YOU THINK OF THIS DAY AND AWAY HE WENT
 BUT JIM FISHED ME OUT AND WAS GOING TO HUG ME AND BLESS ME AND SO ON HE WAS SO GLAD I WAS BACK AND WE WAS SHUT OF THE KING AND THE DUKE BUT I SAYS
 "NOW WHAT YOU DID SEE ON HIS BREAST WAS A SMALL DIM P AND A B WHICH IS AN INITIAL HE DROPPED WHEN HE WAS YOUNG AND A W WITH DASHES BETWEEN THEM SO
HER FACE WOULD GIVE THEM A HINT SURE
 JUST THE SAME OUTSIDE
REV
 HE CAN SAY HE NEVER SEEN US TOGETHER AND IT LL BE THE TRUTH I DON'T WANT TO TALK MUCH ABOUT THE NEXT DAY
 WHEN THEY BORROW A CHAW THEY DON'T GENERLY CUT IT OFF WITH A KNIFE BUT SET THE PLUG IN BETWEEN THEIR TEETH AND GNAW WITH THEIR TEETH AND TUG AT THE PLUG WITH THEIR HANDS TILL THEY GET IT IN TWO
 BUT OTHER TIMES THEY JUST LAZY AROUND
AND JUST LIKE WOMEN
 BUT THEY DIDN'T YET A WHILE
CHAPTER XX
CHAPTER XX
 HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE TREATED SO THAT'S ALWAYS YOUR WAY MAIMALWAYS SAILING IN TO HELP SOMEBODY BEFORE THEY'RE HURT
I TOLD JIM ALL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THE WRECK AND AT THE FERRYBOAT AND I SAID THESE KINDS OF THINGS WAS ADVENTURES
THE SUN WAS UP SO HIGH WHEN I WAKED THAT I JUDGED IT WAS AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK
 _SHE NEVER BUDGE  OH HUCK I BUST OUT A-CRYIN EN GRAB HER UP IN MY ARMS EN SAY OH DE PO LITTLE THING
 TOM HE WENT DOWN THE LIGHTNING-ROD TO SPY AROUND
 I SOLE DE HIDE EN TALLER FOR A DOLLAR EN TEN CENTS YOU HAD FIVE DOLLARS AND TEN CENTS LEFT
 IF I'D A CALLED IT A BOLTHEAD IT WOULD A DONE JUST AS WELL
BUMBLE-UMBLE-UM-BUM-BUM-BUM-BUMAND THE THUNDER WOULD GO RUMBLING AND GRUMBLING AWAY AND QUITAND THEN RIP COMES ANOTHER FLASH AND ANOTHER SOCKDOLAGER
TOM'S VOICE TREMBLED WHILST HE WAS READING THEM AND HE MOST BROKE DOWN
 IT HAD A PICTURE OF A RUNAWAY NIGGER WITH A BUNDLE ON A STICK OVER HIS SHOULDER AND $200 REWARD UNDER IT
 HE HAD SET UP AND PRINTED OFF TWO LITTLE JOBS FOR FARMERS IN THAT PRINTING-OFFICEHORSE BILLSAND TOOK THE MONEY FOUR DOLLARS
 WHAT DID THAT POOR OLD WOMAN DO TO YOU THAT YOU COULD TREAT HER SO MEAN
GENTLEMENGENTLE_MEN  HEAR ME JUST A WORDJUST A SINGLE WORDIF YOU PLEASE
 HE GOT UP AND STRETCHED HIS NECK OUT ABOUT A MINUTE LISTENING
 HE NEVER COULD GO AFTER EVEN A TURNIP-CART BUT HE MUST HAVE THE SWORDS AND GUNS ALL SCOURED UP FOR IT THOUGH THEY WAS ONLY LATH AND BROOMSTICKS AND YOU MIGHT SCOUR AT THEM TILL YOU ROTTED AND THEN THEY WARN'T WORTH A MOUTHFUL OF ASHES MORE THAN WHAT THEY WAS BEFORE
AND WHISPERED AND SAID HE WOULD LISTEN FOR THE STEPS TO GET FURTHER AND WHEN HE NUDGED US JIM MUST GLIDE OUT FIRST AND HIM LAST
IT GOT TO BE VERY LATE AND STILL AND THEN ALONG COMES A STEAMBOAT UP THE RIVER
 BUT TOM SAID HE WOULD LET ME HELP HIM DO IT
 WHY GREAT GOODNESS THERE AIN'T NO CHANCE FOR EM IF THEY DON'T GIT OFF MIGHTY QUICK
SLING A LECTURE SOMETIMESOH I DO LOTS OF THINGSMOST ANYTHING THAT COMES HANDY SO IT AIN'T WORK
AND AUNT SALLY SHE COME IN AND WHEN WE GOT BACK SHE WAS A-STANDING ON TOP OF THE BED RAISING CAIN AND THE RATS WAS DOING WHAT THEY COULD TO KEEP OFF THE DULL TIMES FOR HER
IN THE SOUTH ONE MAN ALL BY HIMSELF HAS STOPPED A STAGE FULL OF MEN IN THE DAYTIME AND ROBBED THE LOT
 I'M FOR PUTTING HIM OUT OF HIS TROUBLES SO'M I SAYS PACKARD VERY QUIET
 TURN HIM LOOSE
 I BEEN SETTING HERE TALKING WITH YOU ALL NIGHT TILL YOU WENT TO SLEEP ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO AND I RECKON I DONE THE SAME
 NOR FROM ME NEITHER
JIM AIN'T GOT NO USE FOR A ROPE LADDER HE HAS GOT USE FOR IT
 YOU'RE EDUCATED TOO THEY SAYCAN READ AND WRITE
 _THEY WOULDN'T USE A GOOSE-QUILL IF THEY HAD IT
 WHY HARE-LWHY JOANNA THEY NEVER SEE A HOLIDAY FROM YEAR'S END TO YEAR'S END
SO WE WAS ALL RIGHT NOW AS TO THE SHIRT AND THE SHEET AND THE SPOON AND THE CANDLES BY THE HELP OF THE CALF AND THE RATS AND THE MIXED-UP COUNTING
 BUCK SAYS
AND ABOUT THE FIRST THING WE DONE WAS TO BAIT ONE OF THE BIG HOOKS WITH A SKINNED RABBIT AND SET IT AND CATCH A CATFISH THAT WAS AS BIG AS A MAN BEING SIX FOOT TWO INCHES LONG AND WEIGHED OVER TWO HUNDRED POUNDS
THERE WAS A FIFTY-POUND SACK OF CORN MEAL AND A SIDE OF BACON AMMUNITION AND A FOUR-GALLON JUG OF WHISKY AND AN OLD BOOK AND TWO NEWSPAPERS FOR WADDING BESIDES SOME TOW
FOR I DIDN'T BELIEVE ANYBODY WAS GOING TO GIVE THE KING AND THE DUKE A HINT AND SO IF I DIDN'T HURRY UP AND GIVE THEM ONE THEY'D GET INTO TROUBLE SURE
 DON'T CRY BUB
 THEY TURNED AROUND THE FOOT OF THE ISLAND AND STARTED UP THE CHANNEL ON THE MISSOURI SIDE UNDER STEAM AND BOOMING ONCE IN A WHILE AS THEY WENT
 I GOT UP AND TRIED TO UNTIE HER BUT I WAS SO EXCITED MY HANDS SHOOK SO I COULDN'T HARDLY DO ANYTHING WITH THEM
COME ALONG HINES
DID YOU SING OUT NO SAH SAYS JIM
 BUT I COULDN'T SEE NO PROFIT IN IT
 THE OLD MAN HAD WROTE A COUPLE OF TIMES TO THE PLANTATION BELOW ORLEANS TO COME AND GET THEIR RUNAWAY NIGGER BUT HADN'T GOT NO ANSWER BECAUSE THERE WARN'T NO SUCH PLANTATION
 BUT I HADN'T NO LUCK SOMEHOW
 ALL ANIMALS LIKE MUSICIN A PRISON THEY DOTE ON IT
SO HARVEY LL KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR FRIENDS WHEN HE GETS HERE WELL THE OLD MAN WENT ON ASKING QUESTIONS TILL HE JUST FAIRLY EMPTIED THAT YOUNG FELLOW
BUT BY AND BY PAP GOT TOO HANDY WITH HIS HICK'RY AND I COULDN'T STAND IT
 WHO TOLD YOU THIS WAS GOSHEN WHY A MAN I MET AT DAYBREAK THIS MORNING JUST AS I WAS GOING TO TURN INTO THE WOODS FOR MY REGULAR SLEEP
SO HE TOOK MY CANOE AND SAID FOR ME TO WAIT TILL HE COME BACK OR I COULD HUNT AROUND FURTHER OR MAYBE I BETTER GO DOWN HOME AND GET THEM READY FOR THE SURPRISE IF I WANTED TO
 WHY HAIN'T YOU BEEN TALKING ABOUT MY COMING BACK AND ALL THAT STUFF AS IF I'D BEEN GONE AWAY HUCKHUCK FINN YOU LOOK ME IN DE EYE
I'M SURPRISED AT YOU M'AM YOU'RE S'RPWHY WHAT DO YOU RECKON I AM
 PRETTY SOON A SPIDER WENT CRAWLING UP MY SHOULDER AND I FLIPPED IT OFF AND IT LIT IN THE CANDLE
AND SAID IF HE ONLY COULD SEE HIS WAY TO IT WE WOULD KEEP IT UP ALL THE REST OF OUR LIVES AND LEAVE JIM TO OUR CHILDREN TO GET OUT
 HE SAYS VERY LOW
 I WAS JUST A-BILING WITH CURIOSITY
AND ON THE SIDE I WARN'T ACQUAINTED WITHWHICH WAS THE NORTH SIDEWE FOUND A SQUARE WINDOW-HOLE UP TOLERABLE HIGH WITH JUST ONE STOUT BOARD NAILED ACROSS IT
 HE IS THE THINNEST KIND OF AN IMPOSTORHAS COME HERE WITH A LOT OF EMPTY NAMES AND FACTS WHICH HE PICKED UP SOMEWHERES AND YOU TAKE THEM FOR PROOFS AND ARE HELPED TO FOOL YOURSELVES BY THESE FOOLISH FRIENDS HERE WHO OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER
 I MADE FAST TO A WILLOW
 AND HE WANTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT RIGHT OFF BECAUSE IT WAS A GRAND ADVENTURE AND MYSTERIOUS AND SO IT HIT HIM WHERE HE LIVED
 IT TELLS ALL ABOUT HIM TO A DOTPAINTS HIM LIKE A PICTURE AND TELLS THE PLANTATION HE'S FRUM BELOW NEWR_LEANS
 BUT MAINLY THEY DON'T DO NOTHING WELL THEN WHAT ARE THEY FOR WHY THEY'RE FOR STYLE
THEN SOMEBODY GIVE A SIGNAL AND THE HOUSE ROSE UP AND WENT FOR THEM
BUT HEAPS OF PARLORS IN TOWNS HAS BEDS IN THEM
 NOT FOR PIE HE WOULDN'T
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT NOW EXCEPT TOOLS
IN ABOUT A MINUTE SOMEBODY SPOKE OUT OF A WINDOW WITHOUT PUTTING HIS HEAD OUT AND SAYS
 WE WENT GLIDING SWIFT ALONG DEAD SILENT PAST THE TIP OF THE PADDLE-BOX AND PAST THE STERN
 I JIS WISH TO GOODNESS HE WAS HEAH NOW_DEN WHAT WOULD HE SAY
 'BOUT THREE MONTHS AGO MY COUSIN BUD FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WAS RIDING THROUGH THE WOODS ON T'OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER AND DIDN'T HAVE NO WEAPON WITH HIM WHICH WAS BLAME FOOLISHNESS AND IN A LONESOME PLACE HE HEARS A HORSE A-COMING BEHIND HIM AND SEES OLD BALDY SHEPHERDSON A-LINKIN AFTER HIM WITH HIS GUN IN HIS HAND AND HIS WHITE HAIR A-FLYING IN THE WIND
 WHY NEVER MIND WHY YET
AND IF YOU'D A DONE IT THEY'D A LEARNT YOU THERE THAT PEOPLE THAT ACTS AS I'D BEEN ACTING ABOUT THAT NIGGER GOES TO EVERLASTING FIRE IT MADE ME SHIVER
 HE NEARLY CRIED HE WAS SO GLAD BUT HE WARN'T SURPRISED
AND TOM GIVE JIM FORTY DOLLARS FOR BEING PRISONER FOR US SO PATIENT AND DOING IT UP SO GOOD AND JIM WAS PLEASED MOST TO DEATH AND BUSTED OUT AND SAYS
 WELL ON EVERY OLD BROKEN-DOWN TREE YOU COULD SEE RABBITS AND SNAKES AND SUCH THINGS
 DON'T YOU GIT TOO PEART
YOU SHOVE RIGHT IN DAH JIST A FEW STEPS MARS JAWGE
 NO SAHI DOAN BUDGE A STEP OUT'N DIS PLACE DOUT A DOCTOR NOT IF IT'S FORTY YEAR I KNOWED HE WAS WHITE INSIDE AND I RECKONED HE'D SAY WHAT HE DID SAYSO IT WAS ALL RIGHT NOW AND I TOLD TOM I WAS A-GOING FOR A DOCTOR
WE GOT ONE AND THEY GOT ONE
 I WAS POWERFUL GLAD TO GET AWAY FROM THE FEUDS AND SO WAS JIM TO GET AWAY FROM THE SWAMP
THEN SHE WOULD TURN A CORNER AND HER LIGHTS WOULD WINK OUT AND HER POWWOW SHUT OFF AND LEAVE THE RIVER STILL AGAIN
BORROW A SHIRT TOO WHAT DO WE WANT OF A SHIRT TOM WANT IT FOR JIM TO KEEP A JOURNAL ON JOURNAL YOUR GRANNY_JIM CAN'T WRITE S'POSE HE CAN'T WRITEHE CAN MAKE MARKS ON THE SHIRT CAN'T HE IF WE MAKE HIM A PEN OUT OF AN OLD PEWTER SPOON OR A PIECE OF AN OLD IRON BARREL-HOOP WHY TOM WE CAN PULL A FEATHER OUT OF A GOOSE AND MAKE HIM A BETTER ONE
 AND THAT'S ENOUGH AND SHE SNATCHED A KISS OF HIM AND FLEW FOR THE HOUSE TO GET THE BED READY AND SCATTERING ORDERS RIGHT AND LEFT AT THE NIGGERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE AS FAST AS HER TONGUE COULD GO EVERY JUMP OF THE WAY
ALL RIGHT DOCTOR SAYS THE KING KINDER MOCKING HIM
 AND AFTER THEY GOT A LITTLE QUIET AGAIN SHE SAYS
AND HE SWALLOWED TWO OR THREE TIMES LIKE A PERSON THAT'S GOT A DRY THROAT AND THEN SAYS
 AND AFTERWARDS WE WOULD WATCH THE LONESOMENESS OF THE RIVER AND KIND OF LAZY ALONG AND BY AND BY LAZY OFF TO SLEEP
 THE DOOR WAS THICK SOLID OAK SLABS
 BUT I DASN'T SCRATCH
 HUMP YOURSELF NOW
AND THEN YOU WOULD SEE ALL THE LOAFERS GET UP AND WATCH THE THING OUT OF SIGHT AND LAUGH AT THE FUN AND LOOK GRATEFUL FOR THE NOISE
WITH WHO
 I WOULDN GIVE A DERN FOR A MILLION UN UM BUT HANG IT JIM YOU'VE CLEAN MISSED THE POINTBLAME IT YOU'VE MISSED IT A THOUSAND MILE WHO
THEN SUSAN SHE WALTZED IN
 I ASKED HER IF SHE RECKONED TOM SAWYER WOULD GO THERE AND SHE SAID NOT BY A CONSIDERABLE SIGHT
AND I DON'T BELIEVE I'VE EVER LOST ONE OF THEM OFF OF ME WELL IT AIN'T YOUR FAULT IF YOU HAVEN'T SILAS
 I PUT MY HAND ON THE DOOR AND PUSHED IT A LITTLE AND A LITTLE MORE TILL SOMEBODY SAID THERE THAT'S ENOUGHPUT YOUR HEAD IN I DONE IT BUT I JUDGED THEY WOULD TAKE IT OFF
 JACK'S BEEN HEAH
AND WE WOULDN'T GET BUT A FEW MINUTES TO DIG EVERY DAY WHILE THEY WAS CHANGING WATCHES AND SO OUR HANDS WOULDN'T GET BLISTERED AND WE COULD KEEP IT UP RIGHT ALONG YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT AND DO IT RIGHT AND THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE DONE
 I SHOVED IN THERE FOR A MINUTE BUT IT WAS TOO VARIOUS FOR ME
 IT WAS FUNNY THEY HADN'T COME IN AFTER STANDING AROUND SO
 IF HE'D A-CHAWED UP ALL THE MEN HE'S BEN A-GWYNE TO CHAW UP IN THE LAST TWENTY YEAR HE'D HAVE CONSIDERABLE RUPUTATION NOW ANOTHER ONE SAYS I WISHT OLD BOGGS D THREATEN ME CUZ THEN I'D KNOW I WARN'T GWYNE TO DIE FOR A THOUSAN YEAR BOGGS COMES A-TEARING ALONG ON HIS HORSE WHOOPING AND YELLING LIKE AN INJUN AND SINGING OUT
OHO-O
 ALL RIGHTI'M GLAD WE FOUND IT OUT DETECTIVE FASHION
 NOW LISTEN TO ME
 WHAT YOU BOUT I OPENED MY EYES AND LOOKED AROUND TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHERE I WAS
 AND THAT GAVE HIM ANOTHER IDEA AND HE SAYS
 THERE WAS PLENTY OTHER FARMER-PREACHERS LIKE THAT AND DONE THE SAME WAY DOWN SOUTH
JIM WHISPERED AND SAID HE WAS FEELING POWERFUL SICK AND TOLD ME TO COME ALONG
 I DIDN'T WANT NO TROUBLE WITH THEIR KIND
THE CIRCUS WOULD LEAVE BEFORE NIGHT SO OUR SHOW WOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE
FOR PRETTY SOON IT BEGUN TO STORM AGAIN AND THIS TIME WORSE THAN EVER
 NO SAH GIMME G'YARTER-SNAKES F I'S GOT TO HAVE M BUT DOAN GIMME NO RATS
 DIS ONE'S POWERFUL DRUNK EN DE DUKE AIN MUCH BETTER I FOUND JIM HAD BEEN TRYING TO GET HIM TO TALK FRENCH SO HE COULD HEAR WHAT IT WAS LIKE
 OF COURSE WHEN THEY GOT TO SNORING WE HAD A LONG GABBLE AND I TOLD JIM EVERYTHING
AND WHEN I MADE FAST NOBODY COULD A SEEN THE CANOE FROM THE OUTSIDE
 YOU GOT TO DO IT WITH TEARS SHE'LL DIE ON MY HAN'S MARS TOM SHE SHOLY WILL
BUT I WAS OVER THE SHOAL WATER NOW SO I WENT RIGHT ALONG HER EYES A-BLAZING HIGHER AND HIGHER ALL THE TIME AND TOLD HER EVERY BLAME THING FROM WHERE WE FIRST STRUCK THAT YOUNG FOOL GOING UP TO THE STEAMBOAT CLEAR THROUGH TO WHERE SHE FLUNG HERSELF ON TO THE KING'S BREAST AT THE FRONT DOOR AND HE KISSED HER SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN TIMESAND THEN UP SHE JUMPS WITH HER FACE AFIRE LIKE SUNSET AND SAYS
GENERLY IT'S THROUGH SOLID ROCK
WELL BLAMED IF THE KING DIDN'T BILL THE HOUSE AND THE NIGGERS AND ALL THE PROPERTY FOR AUCTION STRAIGHT OFFSALE TWO DAYS AFTER THE FUNERAL
 ALL I WANTED WAS TO GO SOMEWHERES
WELL DEN I RECK'N I DID DREAM IT HUCK
 THERE WARN'T NO COLOR IN HIS FACE WHERE HIS FACE SHOWED
YOU SEE MAYBE YOU'S GOT TO BE PO A LONG TIME FUST EN SO YOU MIGHT GIT DISCOURAGE EN KILL YO'SEF F YOU DIDN KNOW BY DE SIGN DAT YOU GWYNE TO BE RICH BYMEBY HAVE YOU GOT HAIRY ARMS AND A HAIRY BREAST JIM WHAT'S DE USE TO AX DAT QUESTION
I RECK'N HE'S BEN DEAD TWO ER THREE DAYS
 IT'S BEST
SO I SAYS I GOT TO HAVE HELP SOMEHOW
 I'VE A GOOD NOTION TO TAKE ANDSAY WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY KISSING ME HE LOOKED KIND OF HUMBLE AND SAYS
THEN A PALE PLACE IN THE SKY
 I THOUGHT THEM POOR GIRLS AND THEM NIGGERS WOULD BREAK THEIR HEARTS FOR GRIEF
BUT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO LIGHT IT FOR UP-STREAM BOATS UNLESS WE SEE WE WAS IN WHAT THEY CALL A CROSSING
 NOW LOOKY HERE
 MAN THE SWEEPSMAN THE SWEEPS BUT ME AND JIM WAS CONSULTINGAND THINKING
 BUT I AIN GWYNE TO RESK NO MO MONEY IN STOCK
 SO THEN I JUDGED THAT ALL THAT STUFF WAS ONLY JUST ONE OF TOM SAWYER'S LIES
 SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN WAS BAREFOOTED AND SOME OF THE CHILDREN DIDN'T HAVE ON ANY CLOTHES BUT JUST A TOW-LINEN SHIRT
AND BY AND BY YOU COULD SEE A STREAK ON THE WATER WHICH YOU KNOW BY THE LOOK OF THE STREAK THAT THERE'S A SNAG THERE IN A SWIFT CURRENT WHICH BREAKS ON IT AND MAKES THAT STREAK LOOK THAT WAY
 I DIDN'T KNOW HER FACE
THEY DON'T FIGHT WITH COURAGE THAT'S BORN IN THEM BUT WITH COURAGE THAT'S BORROWED FROM THEIR MASS AND FROM THEIR OFFICERS
 I HADN'T SEEN NO HOUSE OUT IN THE COUNTRY BEFORE THAT WAS SO NICE AND HAD SO MUCH STYLE
 I WENT TO THE RAFT AND SET DOWN IN THE WIGWAM TO THINK
AND IT TAKES THEM WEEKS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS TO FILE IT OUT TOO BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT TO DO IT BY RUBBING IT ON THE WALL
 I SAID LIKELY WE WOULDN'T BECAUSE I HAD HEARD SAY THERE WARN'T BUT ABOUT A DOZEN HOUSES THERE AND IF THEY DIDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE THEM LIT UP HOW WAS WE GOING TO KNOW WE WAS PASSING A TOWN
IT WAS DARK AS PITCH THERE
 THE WIDOW DOUGLAS SHE TOOK ME FOR HER SON AND ALLOWED SHE WOULD SIVILIZE ME
WELL WHEN IT COME DARK I TUCK OUT UP DE RIVER ROAD EN WENT BOUT TWO MILE ER MORE TO WHAH DEY WARN'T NO HOUSES
AND SUCH ANOTHER CLACK A BODY NEVER HEARD
AND HIM AND SOME OTHERS LAUGHED AND SAID STUFF WELL THEN THEY SAILED IN ON THE GENERAL INVESTIGATION AND THERE WE HAD IT UP AND DOWN HOUR IN HOUR OUT AND NOBODY NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT SUPPER NOR EVER SEEMED TO THINK ABOUT ITAND SO THEY KEPT IT UP AND KEPT IT UP
 YES GENTLEMEN YOU SEE BEFORE YOU IN BLUE JEANS AND MISERY THE WANDERIN EXILED TRAMPLED-ON AND SUFFERIN RIGHTFUL KING OF FRANCE WELL HE CRIED AND TOOK ON SO THAT ME AND JIM DIDN'T KNOW HARDLY WHAT TO DO WE WAS SO SORRYAND SO GLAD AND PROUD WE'D GOT HIM WITH US TOO
 I HAIN'T DONE NOTHING TO HIM
 THE IDEA OF YOU THINKING YOU HAD PLUCK ENOUGH TO LYNCH A MAN
STREETS EMPTY AND PERFECTLY DEAD AND STILL LIKE SUNDAY
 HE SAID THERE WAS HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS THERE AND ELEPHANTS AND TREASURE AND SO ON BUT WE HAD ENEMIES WHICH HE CALLED MAGICIANS
THEN THE RIVER SOFTENED UP AWAY OFF AND WARN'T BLACK ANY MORE BUT GRAY
 WE DIDN'T COOK NONE OF THE PIES IN THE WASH-PANAFRAID THE SOLDER WOULD MELT
 I WENT FOR IT CAUTIOUS AND SLOW
 THE STATEMENTS WAS INTERESTING BUT TOUGH
 SET THE RUNWHAT IS THE CHILD TALKING ABOUT
 THERE WAS HEAPS OF OLD GREASY CARDS SCATTERED AROUND OVER THE FLOOR AND OLD WHISKY BOTTLES AND A COUPLE OF MASKS MADE OUT OF BLACK CLOTH
ALL OF A SUDDEN THE LIGHTNING LET GO A PERFECT SLUICE OF WHITE GLARE AND SOMEBODY SINGS OUT
 SO ON WE PROWLED AGAIN
AND SO WE SADDLE-BAGGSED
 BUT IF WE FIND THEIR BOAT WE CAN PUT ALL OF EM IN A BAD FIXFOR THE SHERIFF LL GET EM
THEN HE COME TIPTOEING DOWN AND STOOD RIGHT BETWEEN US
 SO WE WOULD PUT IN THE DAY LAZYING AROUND LISTENING TO THE STILLNESS
 I DONE IT OF COURSE
 BUT I MADE OUT TO SEE THAT THE DRIFT OF THE CURRENT WAS TOWARDS THE LEFT-HAND SHORE WHICH MEANT THAT I WAS IN A CROSSING
BUT I S'POSE THERE WAS SO MANY STRANGE THINGS GOING ON SHE WAS JUST IN A SWEAT ABOUT EVERY LITTLE THING THAT WARN'T YARD-STICK STRAIGHT
WELL THAT NIGHT WE HAD OUR SHOW
HE RIPPED OUT SOMETHING BRISK AND SAID LET HIM ALONE
YOU JUST ASK HIS PARDON SHE DONE IT TOO
A NIGGER WOMAN COME TEARING OUT OF THE KITCHEN WITH A ROLLING-PIN IN HER HAND SINGING OUT BEGONE YOU TIGE
 THE MEAL SIFTED OUT AND MADE A LITTLE TRACK ALL THE WAY TO THE LAKE
WHAT YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THE SERVANT-GIRL YOU'LL BE HER
TEACH SINGING-GEOGRAPHY SCHOOL FOR A CHANGE
 MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER ELDEST SON OF THE DUKE OF BRIDGEWATER FLED TO THIS COUNTRY ABOUT THE END OF THE LAST CENTURY TO BREATHE THE PURE AIR OF FREEDOM
NO WHOOPING-COUGH DID RACK HIS FRAME    NOR MEASLES DREAR WITH SPOTS
DAT YOU WOULD HONEY
 IS A COW A MAN?ER IS A COW A CAT NO SHE AIN'T EITHER OF THEM WELL DEN SHE AIN'T GOT NO BUSINESS TO TALK LIKE EITHER ONE ER THE YUTHER OF EM
 NINE LOGS WAS ENOUGH FOR ONE TIME
 LONG AS YOU'RE IN THIS TOWN DON'T YOU FORGIT THAT_YOU HEAR  THEN HE SAYS TO THE DUKE WE GOT TO JEST SWALLER IT AND SAY NOTH'N
 DON'T BE A FOOL AGAIN AND LET PEOPLE GUESS WHAT IS THE MATTER
 THERE WAS TWO OLD DIRTY CALICO DRESSES AND A SUN-BONNET AND SOME WOMEN'S UNDERCLOTHES HANGING AGAINST THE WALL AND SOME MEN'S CLOTHING TOO
AND I ONLY TRIED TO CHASE THEM A LITTLE WHILE ANYWAY BECAUSE IT WAS WORSE THAN CHASING A JACK-O'-LANTERN
WHEN ME AND JIM HEARD THAT WE DIDN'T FEEL SO BRASH AS WHAT WE DID BEFORE
OH DO SHET UP!S'POSE THE RATS TOOK THE SHEET
DESPISED LOVE STRUCK NOT WITH WOE    THAT HEAD OF CURLY KNOTS NOR STOMACH TROUBLES LAID HIM LOW    YOUNG STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS
THEY WAS SET UP THREE OR FOUR FOOT ABOVE GROUND ON STILTS SO AS TO BE OUT OF REACH OF THE WATER WHEN THE RIVER WAS OVERFLOWED
I WAS PRETTY TIRED AND THE FIRST THING I KNOWED I WAS ASLEEP
 I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED IT LETTING HIM GO OFF THAT WAY WITHOUT ANYBODY TO WATCH HIM
 THINGS BEING SO UNCERTAIN WHAT I RECOMMEND IS THIS
 AFTER ALL THIS LONG JOURNEY AND AFTER ALL WE'D DONE FOR THEM SCOUNDRELS HERE IT WAS ALL COME TO NOTHING EVERYTHING ALL BUSTED UP AND RUINED BECAUSE THEY COULD HAVE THE HEART TO SERVE JIM SUCH A TRICK AS THAT AND MAKE HIM A SLAVE AGAIN ALL HIS LIFE AND AMONGST STRANGERS TOO FOR FORTY DIRTY DOLLARS
 WE GOT TO DIG THE INSCRIPTIONS INTO A ROCK
WHAT IS IT OVER
IT WARN'T ME DRY UP
 BUT IT WARN'T NO TIME TO BE SENTIMENTERING
WELL WHEN TOM AND ME GOT TO THE EDGE OF THE HILLTOP WE LOOKED AWAY DOWN INTO THE VILLAGE AND COULD SEE THREE OR FOUR LIGHTS TWINKLING WHERE THERE WAS SICK FOLKS MAYBE
 EVERYBODY MOST LEASTWAYS WOMEN CRIED FOR JOY TO SEE THEM MEET AGAIN AT LAST AND HAVE SUCH GOOD TIMES
BUT IT'S SO
 IT WAS YOUNG HARNEY SHEPHERDSON
THEY SWARMED UP TOWARDS SHERBURN'S HOUSE A-WHOOPING AND RAGING LIKE INJUNS AND EVERYTHING HAD TO CLEAR THE WAY OR GET RUN OVER AND TROMPED TO MUSH AND IT WAS AWFUL TO SEE
 I WAS GOING TO RUSH BY AND GET AWAY BUT A LOT OF DOGS JUMPED OUT AND WENT TO HOWLING AND BARKING AT ME AND I KNOWED BETTER THAN TO MOVE ANOTHER PEG
 NEXT WE SLID INTO THE RIVER AND HAD A SWIM SO AS TO FRESHEN UP AND COOL OFF
AND ALL THE TIME THAT CLOWN CARRIED ON SO IT MOST KILLED THE PEOPLE
WHEN HE GOT DONE HE COULDN'T NO WAY MAKE UP HIS MIND WHICH ONE FOR JIM TO SCRABBLE ON TO THE WALL THEY WAS ALL SO GOOD
AND SO I COME DOWN THE BACK WAY WHO'D YOU GIVE THE BAGGAGE TO NOBODY WHY CHILD IT LL BE STOLE NOT WHERE I HID IT I RECKON IT WON'T I SAYS
 I AM THE LINEAL DESCENDANT OF THAT INFANTI AM THE RIGHTFUL DUKE OF BRIDGEWATER
 SO TOM GOT OUT A SHEET OF PAPER THAT HE HAD WROTE THE OATH ON AND READ IT
 ONE UV EM IS WHITE EN SHINY EN T'OTHER ONE IS BLACK
 I WAS PRETTY NEAR CERTAIN I'D SEEN SMOKE OVER THERE ABOUT THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THAT SO I SAYS TO MYSELF LIKE AS NOT THAT NIGGER'S HIDING OVER THERE
WHEN THE FIRST STREAK OF DAY BEGAN TO SHOW WE TIED UP TO A TOWHEAD IN A BIG BEND ON THE ILLINOIS SIDE AND HACKED OFF COTTONWOOD BRANCHES WITH THE HATCHET AND COVERED UP THE RAFT WITH THEM SO SHE LOOKED LIKE THERE HAD BEEN A CAVE-IN IN THE BANK THERE
AND IF EVERYBODY DON'T GO JUST SO HE WHACKS THEIR HEADS OFF
THEN I MANNED MY OARS AND SHOVED FOR THE LIGHT
 BUT I KNOWED I COULD TIRE HIM OUT AT THAT
 WE'LL FETCH A ROCK JIM SAID THE ROCK WAS WORSE THAN THE LOGS
 IT SOUNDS LIKE FLATTERY BUT IT AIN'T NO FLATTERY
BUT THE GRANGERFORDS STAYED ON THEIR HORSES AND CAPERED AROUND THE OLD MAN AND PEPPERED AWAY AT HIM AND HE PEPPERED AWAY AT THEM
AND RUN THIS WAY AND THAT IN THE WOODS WHOOPING AND SCREECHING
AND BEHIND THE WOMAN COMES A LITTLE NIGGER GIRL AND TWO LITTLE NIGGER BOYS WITHOUT ANYTHING ON BUT TOW-LINEN SHIRTS AND THEY HUNG ON TO THEIR MOTHER'S GOWN AND PEEPED OUT FROM BEHIND HER AT ME BASHFUL THE WAY THEY ALWAYS DO
 I WAS AT JUDGE THATCHER'S AS QUICK AS I COULD GET THERE
THEY SAY HE WAS A SIGHT TO LOOK AT
 BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER MUCH BECAUSE THEY WAS STILL ON THE PREMISES SOMEWHERES
 THEY'VE BROKE FOR THE RIVER
AND ABOUT HIS LITTLE BOY THE DOLPHIN THAT WOULD A BEEN A KING BUT THEY TOOK AND SHUT HIM UP IN JAIL AND SOME SAY HE DIED THERE
WELL IT BEING AWAY IN THE NIGHT AND STORMY AND ALL SO MYSTERIOUS-LIKE I FELT JUST THE WAY ANY OTHER BOY WOULD A FELT WHEN I SEE THAT WRECK LAYING THERE SO MOURNFUL AND LONESOME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER
HE WAS ALWAYS MIGHTY GOOD THAT WAY JIM WAS
BOB WAS THE OLDEST AND TOM NEXTTALL BEAUTIFUL MEN WITH VERY BROAD SHOULDERS AND BROWN FACES AND LONG BLACK HAIR AND BLACK EYES
 BUT IT WAS A MISTAKE AUNT SALLY
 BUT IT WARN'T NO USE
 BUT IT WARN'T NO USE
AND MORE A-COMING
 GO LONG NOW THE WHOLE KIT AND BILING OF YE
SO WE POKED ALONG BACK HOME AND I WARN'T FEELING SO BRASH AS I WAS BEFORE BUT KIND OF ORNERY AND HUMBLE AND TO BLAME SOMEHOWTHOUGH I HADN'T DONE NOTHING
 THEY ALL DO JIM SAYS
 HE COULDN'T SEEM TO MAKE IT OUT
AND THEN WE'LL HITCH UP AND TAKE YOU DOWN TO NICHOLS'S OH I CAN'T MAKE YOU SO MUCH TROUBLE
 ANY WAY THAT SUITS YOU SUITS ME
AND YOU NEVER SEE A CABIN AS BLITHESOME AS JIM'S WAS WHEN THEY'D ALL SWARM OUT FOR MUSIC AND GO FOR HIM
WELL HE SAYS IF THEY'D A BEN SOME I RECKON I'D A GOT ONE THEY ALL LAUGHED AND BOB SAYS
 HONEST INJUN I WILL
THE THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE MONEY LL BE FOUND WHEN THEY COME TO SCREW ON THE LID
SO WE STRUCK FOR AN ISLAND AND HID THE RAFT AND SUNK THE SKIFF AND TURNED IN AND SLEPT LIKE DEAD PEOPLE
 COL
 AS WE WAS PASSING THROUGH THE SETTING-ROOM THE OLD MAN HE TOOK UP HIS HAT AND THE SHINGLE-NAIL FELL OUT ON THE FLOOR AND HE JUST MERELY PICKED IT UP AND LAID IT ON THE MANTEL-SHELF AND NEVER SAID NOTHING AND WENT OUT
 I NEVER SEE A LIKELIER LOT OF RATS THAN WHAT THAT FIRST HAUL WAS
 HE TOLD ME WHAT IT WAS AND I SEE IN A MINUTE IT WAS WORTH FIFTEEN OF MINE FOR STYLE AND WOULD MAKE JIM JUST AS FREE A MAN AS MINE WOULD AND MAYBE GET US ALL KILLED BESIDES
AND AS THEY WENT BY I SEE THEY HAD THE KING AND THE DUKE ASTRADDLE OF A RAILTHAT IS I KNOWED IT WAS THE KING AND THE DUKE THOUGH THEY WAS ALL OVER TAR AND FEATHERS AND DIDN'T LOOK LIKE NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT WAS HUMANJUST LOOKED LIKE A COUPLE OF MONSTROUS BIG SOLDIER-PLUMES
I DID WISH THE FOOL WOULD THINK TO BEAT A TIN PAN AND BEAT IT ALL THE TIME BUT HE NEVER DID AND IT WAS THE STILL PLACES BETWEEN THE WHOOPS THAT WAS MAKING THE TROUBLE FOR ME
 THE KING WAS SATISFIED
 BUT YOU GOT A GUN
 SO THEN WE LAID IN WITH JIM THE SECOND NIGHT AND TORE UP THE SHEET ALL IN LITTLE STRINGS AND TWISTED THEM TOGETHER AND LONG BEFORE DAYLIGHT WE HAD A LOVELY ROPE THAT YOU COULD A HUNG A PERSON WITH
 THEY JUST SET AROUNDEXCEPT MAYBE WHEN THERE'S A WAR
 AND WHEN WE STEPPED ON TO THE RAFT I SAYS
 JIM SAID HE RECKONED THE PEOPLE IN THAT HOUSE STOLE THE COAT BECAUSE IF THEY'D A KNOWED THE MONEY WAS THERE THEY WOULDN'T A LEFT IT
 HE OFTEN DONE THAT
BUT WAIT A MINUTE
 GIMME A PENCIL AND A PIECE OF PAPER
 IT WAS A DRIFT-CANOE SURE ENOUGH AND I CLUMB IN AND PADDLED HER ASHORE
HE MIGHT SCARE THEM OUT OF HERE YET
 I SET STILL AND LISTENED

 I HAD MY PIPE EN A PLUG ER DOG-LEG EN SOME MATCHES IN MY CAP EN DEY WARN'T WET SO I UZ ALL RIGHT AND SO YOU AIN'T HAD NO MEAT NOR BREAD TO EAT ALL THIS TIME
 JUST THEN JIM BEGUN TO BREATHE HEAVY
 WELL ALL DE NIGGERS WENT IN BUT DEY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH

BY THE LIVING JINGO HERE'S THE BAG OF GOLD ON HIS BREAST HINES LET OUT A WHOOP LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE AND DROPPED MY WRIST AND GIVE A BIG SURGE TO BUST HIS WAY IN AND GET A LOOK AND THE WAY I LIT OUT AND SHINNED FOR THE ROAD IN THE DARK THERE AIN'T NOBODY CAN TELL
DON'T EVER LET ON TO KNOW US
 WE JUDGED WE COULD MAKE MILES ENOUGH THAT NIGHT TO GET OUT OF THE REACH OF THE POWWOW WE RECKONED THE DUKE'S WORK IN THE PRINTING OFFICE WAS GOING TO MAKE IN THAT LITTLE TOWN
 LOTS OF EM HEARD ME AND CAN TELL WHAT I SAID
 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOUR PAP

 THEY BELONG TO WHOEVER RUBS THE LAMP OR THE RING AND THEY'VE GOT TO DO WHATEVER HE SAYS
 WHEN HE HAD GOT IT PRETTY GOOD HIM AND THE DUKE BEGUN TO PRACTICE IT TOGETHER
IT WAS THE RAFT AND MIGHTY GLAD WAS WE TO GET ABOARD OF IT AGAIN
WELL I KNOW WHAT I'S GWYNE TO DO
 WELL THE DUKE ALLOWED HE WOULD TAKE MY BED
 HE TOLD THEM HE WAS A PIRATEBEEN A PIRATE FOR THIRTY YEARS OUT IN THE INDIAN OCEANAND HIS CREW WAS THINNED OUT CONSIDERABLE LAST SPRING IN A FIGHT AND HE WAS HOME NOW TO TAKE OUT SOME FRESH MEN AND THANKS TO GOODNESS HE'D BEEN ROBBED LAST NIGHT AND PUT ASHORE OFF OF A STEAMBOAT WITHOUT A CENT AND HE WAS GLAD OF IT
WE LIVED IN THAT OLD CABIN AND HE ALWAYS LOCKED THE DOOR AND PUT THE KEY UNDER HIS HEAD NIGHTS
 WHY HOW IN THE NATION DID THEY EVER GIT INTO SUCH A SCRAPE EASY ENOUGH
JIM TALKED OUT LOUD ALL THE TIME WHILE I WAS TALKING TO MYSELF
SO I RECKON THEY'VE DROVE THE OWDACIOUS LOAFERS OUT OF TOWN BEFORE THIS TIME SO THERE IT WAS!BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
THEY ALWAYS DIG OUT WITH A CASE-KNIFEAND NOT THROUGH DIRT MIND YOU

 WE'LL USE THEM BOTH
 BY JINGS WE FORGOT TO FASTEN THAT LEAN-TO DOOR
 BUT I RECKONED IT WAS ABOUT AS WELL THE WAY IT WAS
BUT I DIDN'T READ THE POETRY
 IT WAS PACKARD
WE AIN'T GOT NO TIME TO SPARE
I TOLD OLD THATCHER SO TO HIS FACE
IF YOU DIDN'T PUT THE MONEY THERE SAY IT AND I'LL B'LIEVE YOU AND TAKE BACK EVERYTHING I SAID YOU OLD SCOUNDREL I DIDN'T AND YOU KNOW I DIDN'T
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING
 YOU ASK JUDGE THATCHER
WELL I WAS MOST ALL THE TIME AT IT BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT THE ONLY WAY TO PUT IN THE TIME
AND SOMETIMES ON THE WATER YOU COULD SEE A SPARK OR TWOON A RAFT OR A SCOW YOU KNOW
AND THERE WAS THEM KIND OF FAINT DRONINGS OF BUGS AND FLIES IN THE AIR THAT MAKES IT SEEM SO LONESOME AND LIKE EVERYBODY'S DEAD AND GONE
 ALL RIGHT THEN
BUT WE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF A HOLE TO SHOW FOR IT
AND WE HAD TO STEAL CANDLES AND THE SHEET AND THE SHIRT AND YOUR DRESS AND SPOONS AND TIN PLATES AND CASE-KNIVES AND THE WARMING-PAN AND THE GRINDSTONE AND FLOUR AND JUST NO END OF THINGS AND YOU CAN'T THINK WHAT WORK IT WAS TO MAKE THE SAWS AND PENS AND INSCRIPTIONS AND ONE THING OR ANOTHER AND YOU CAN'T THINK HALF THE FUN IT WAS
 THEY DON'T SET UP WITH PEOPLE THAT'S GOT THE MUMPS THEY DON'T DON'T THEY
 IT WAS THE RAFT
 IT WAS VERY CURIOUS SOMEHOW
 IITHOUGHT YOU'D LIKE IT WHY YOU BORN FOOL  SHE TOOK UP THE SPINNING STICK AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM GIVING HIM A CRACK WITH IT
AND SO HE GLIDED AND GLIDED AROUND THREE SIDES OF THE ROOM AND THEN ROSE UP AND SHADED HIS MOUTH WITH HIS HANDS AND STRETCHED HIS NECK OUT TOWARDS THE PREACHER OVER THE PEOPLE'S HEADS AND SAYS IN A KIND OF A COARSE WHISPER HE HAD A RAT  THEN HE DROOPED DOWN AND GLIDED ALONG THE WALL AGAIN TO HIS PLACE
 WE GOT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS APIECEALL GOLD
I STRUCK AN IDEA PRETTY SOON
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BILGEWATER KIN I TRUST YOU SAYS THE OLD MAN STILL SORT OF SOBBING
EF I STOLE A SKIFT TO CROSS OVER DEY'D MISS DAT SKIFT YOU SEE EN DEY'D KNOW BOUT WHAH I'D LAN ON DE YUTHER SIDE EN WHAH TO PICK UP MY TRACK
 HE NEVER SPOKE
 THEY SET UP WITH HER ALL NIGHT MISS MARY JANE SAID AND THEY DON'T THINK SHE'LL LAST MANY HOURS ONLY THINK OF THAT NOW
 WILL YOU HIS EYE LIT UP AND HE SAYS
WHEN WE WAS PASSING BY THE KITCHEN I FELL OVER A ROOT AND MADE A NOISE
JIM SAID IF WE HAD THE CANOE HID IN A GOOD PLACE AND HAD ALL THE TRAPS IN THE CAVERN WE COULD RUSH THERE IF ANYBODY WAS TO COME TO THE ISLAND AND THEY WOULD NEVER FIND US WITHOUT DOGS
BROKE HIS ARM_VERY LIKELY AIN'T IT?AND VERY CONVENIENT TOO FOR A FRAUD THAT'S GOT TO MAKE SIGNS AND AIN'T LEARNT HOW
I COULDN'T SEEM TO FIND THE PLACE
 AND NEXT TIME JIM TOLD IT HE SAID THEY RODE HIM DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS
 THAT AIN'T ALL NUTHER
TOWARDS DAYBREAK WE TIED UP AND JIM WAS MIGHTY PARTICULAR ABOUT HIDING THE RAFT GOOD
I'LL STEAL IT AND HIDE IT
I HAIN'T SAID NOTHING SAH NOT A WORD NO SAH I HAIN'T SAID A WORD DID YOU EVER SEE US BEFORE NO SAH
 AND THAT IS WHAT HE DONE
 MY BUT I WUZ MAD
 IF YOU STOOD FOUR OR FIVE FOOT AWAY AND DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS SAWED YOU WOULDN'T NEVER NOTICE IT
BUT I KNOWED THEY WAS BECAUSE THEY WAS ALWAYS TAKING OFF THEIR HATS AND PUTTING THEM ON AND SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AND CHANGING THEIR SEATS AND FUMBLING WITH THEIR BUTTONS
 IF I'M IN THE WAY HERE I'LL NO YOU WON'T
 WELL JUDGE THATCHER HE TOOK IT AND PUT IT OUT AT INTEREST AND IT FETCHED US A DOLLAR A DAY APIECE ALL THE YEAR ROUNDMORE THAN A BODY COULD TELL WHAT TO DO WITH
 IT WAS THE SPLENDIDEST SIGHT THAT EVER WAS WHEN THEY ALL COME RIDING IN TWO AND TWO A GENTLEMAN AND LADY SIDE BY SIDE THE MEN JUST IN THEIR DRAWERS AND UNDERSHIRTS AND NO SHOES NOR STIRRUPS AND RESTING THEIR HANDS ON THEIR THIGHS EASY AND COMFORTABLETHERE MUST A BEEN TWENTY OF THEMAND EVERY LADY WITH A LOVELY COMPLEXION AND PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL AND LOOKING JUST LIKE A GANG OF REAL SURE-ENOUGH QUEENS AND DRESSED IN CLOTHES THAT COST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND JUST LITTERED WITH DIAMONDS
 WAS THERE ANY SUCH MARK ON PETER WILKS BREAST BOTH OF THEM SPOKE UP AND SAYS
 RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WIGWAM WE MADE A LAYER OF DIRT ABOUT FIVE OR SIX INCHES DEEP WITH A FRAME AROUND IT FOR TO HOLD IT TO ITS PLACE
JUDGE THATCHER SURPRISED JIM LISTENING PAP HUCK AND HIS FATHER REFORMING THE DRUNKARD FALLING FROM GRACE GETTING OUT OF THE WAY SOLID COMFORT THINKING IT OVER RAISING A HOWL GIT UP THE SHANTY SHOOTING THE PIG TAKING A REST IN THE WOODS WATCHING THE BOAT DISCOVERING THE CAMP FIRE JIM AND THE GHOST MISTO BRADISH'S NIGGER EXPLORING THE CAVE IN THE CAVE JIM SEES A DEAD MAN THEY FOUND EIGHT DOLLARS JIM AND THE SNAKE OLD HANK BUNKER A FAIR FIT COME IN HIM AND ANOTHER MAN SHE PUTS UP A SNACK HUMP YOURSELF ON THE RAFT HE SOMETIMES LIFTED A CHICKEN PLEASE DON'T BILL IT AIN'T GOOD MORALS OH
 IT HADN'T EVER COME HOME TO ME BEFORE WHAT THIS THING WAS THAT I WAS DOING
LOOK AT GILFORD DUDLEY
AND I COULDN'T SEEM TO GET MY MOUTH TO TELL HER WHAT WOULD MAKE HER SEE THAT CORPSE LAYING IN THE COFFIN WITH THAT BAG OF MONEY ON HIS STOMACH
WHY HALF THE TIME YOU CAN'T READ ANYTHING A PRISONER WRITES ON A TIN PLATE OR ANYWHERE ELSE WELL THEN WHAT'S THE SENSE IN WASTING THE PLATES WHY BLAME IT ALL IT AIN'T THE PRISONER'S PLATES BUT IT'S SOMEBODY'S PLATES AIN'T IT WELL SPOS'N IT IS
YOU GOT ANY SPIDERS IN HERE JIM NO SAH THANKS TO GOODNESS I HAIN'T MARS TOM ALL RIGHT WE'LL GET YOU SOME BUT BLESS YOU HONEY I DOAN WANT NONE
LEASTWAYS I DID THE DUKE SAYS THE SAME WAY
 SO SAYS I I'LL KEEP A LOOKOUT AND IF ANY OF THEM'S FLOATING AROUND AFTER ME I'LL GIVE THEM A SHOW
MARS SID YOU'LL SAY I'S A FOOL BUT IF I DIDN'T B'LIEVE I SEE MOST A MILLION DOGS ER DEVILS ER SOME'N I WISHT I MAY DIE RIGHT HEAH IN DESE TRACKS
 SO HE WATCHED OUT FOR ME ONE DAY IN THE SPRING AND CATCHED ME AND TOOK ME UP THE RIVER ABOUT THREE MILE IN A SKIFF AND CROSSED OVER TO THE ILLINOIS SHORE WHERE IT WAS WOODY AND THERE WARN'T NO HOUSES BUT AN OLD LOG HUT IN A PLACE WHERE THE TIMBER WAS SO THICK YOU COULDN'T FIND IT IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS
SO I JUST GIVE UP TRYING AND UP AND SAYS
 HE DRAGGED ME RIGHT ALONG HE WAS SO EXCITED AND I HAD TO RUN TO KEEP UP
 HE SAID IT WAS ALL DONE BY ENCHANTMENT
WELL WHAT IS IT
AND WHILST WE WAS A-STANDING THERE IN THE DIMMISH LIGHT HERE COMES A COUPLE OF THE HOUNDS BULGING IN FROM UNDER JIM'S BED
AND WHEN YOU ROLL OVER THE DRY SHUCKS SOUND LIKE YOU WAS ROLLING OVER IN A PILE OF DEAD LEAVES
WELL GUESS HE SAYS
WELL WE SWARMED ALONG DOWN THE RIVER ROAD JUST CARRYING ON LIKE WILDCATS
 WE STOP STAGES AND CARRIAGES ON THE ROAD WITH MASKS ON AND KILL THE PEOPLE AND TAKE THEIR WATCHES AND MONEY MUST WE ALWAYS KILL THE PEOPLE OH CERTAINLY
I COULDN'T THINK OF IT
 WE USED TO HOP OUT OF THE WOODS AND GO CHARGING DOWN ON HOG-DRIVERS AND WOMEN IN CARTS TAKING GARDEN STUFF TO MARKET BUT WE NEVER HIVED ANY OF THEM
 I TIED UP IN THE OLD PLACE AND RECKONED I WOULD SLEEP IN THE CANOE
HE PUT HIS KNIFE UNDER HIM AND SAID HE WOULD SLEEP AND GET STRONG AND THEN HE WOULD SEE WHO WAS WHO
LEAVE ME ALONE TO CIPHER OUT A WAY SO WE CAN RUN IN THE DAYTIME IF WE WANT TO
 SO I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT
 HE USED TO LAY DRUNK WITH THE HOGS IN THE TANYARD BUT HE HAIN'T BEEN SEEN IN THESE PARTS FOR A YEAR OR MORE THEY TALKED IT OVER AND THEY WAS GOING TO RULE ME OUT BECAUSE THEY SAID EVERY BOY MUST HAVE A FAMILY OR SOMEBODY TO KILL OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR AND SQUARE FOR THE OTHERS
 BUT HE STOPPED AND LOOKED AROUND SLOW LIKE HE WISHED HE COULD RUN ACROSS A FRIENDLY EYE SOMEWHERES AND FETCHED UP ON THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S AND SAYS DIDN'T YOU THINK SHE'D LIKE ME TO KISS HER SIR WHY NO
WELL THEN I HAPPENED TO THINK HOW THEY ALWAYS PUT QUICKSILVER IN LOAVES OF BREAD AND FLOAT THEM OFF BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS GO RIGHT TO THE DROWNDED CARCASS AND STOP THERE
 I COULDN'T TELL HOW MANY WAS IN IT
 "WHER YOU BOUND FOR YOUNG MAN FOR THE STEAMBOAT
AND FLOUR AND CANDLES AND CANDLESTICKS AND SPOONS AND THE OLD WARMING-PAN AND MOST A THOUSAND THINGS THAT I DISREMEMBER NOW AND MY NEW CALICO DRESS
 HERE'S A GOVMENT THAT CALLS ITSELF A GOVMENT AND LETS ON TO BE A GOVMENT AND THINKS IT IS A GOVMENT AND YET'S GOT TO SET STOCK-STILL FOR SIX WHOLE MONTHS BEFORE IT CAN TAKE A HOLD OF A PROWLING THIEVING INFERNAL WHITE-SHIRTED FREE NIGGER AND PAP WAS AGOING ON SO HE NEVER NOTICED WHERE HIS OLD LIMBER LEGS WAS TAKING HIM TO SO HE WENT HEAD OVER HEELS OVER THE TUB OF SALT PORK AND BARKED BOTH SHINS AND THE REST OF HIS SPEECH WAS ALL THE HOTTEST KIND OF LANGUAGEMOSTLY HOVE AT THE NIGGER AND THE GOVMENT THOUGH HE GIVE THE TUB SOME TOO ALL ALONG HERE AND THERE
 TO THINK HERE I'VE BEEN NIGHT AFTER NIGHT A_YOU JUST GET WELL ONCE YOU YOUNG SCAMP AND I LAY I'LL TAN THE OLD HARRY OUT O BOTH O YE BUT TOM HE WAS SO PROUD AND JOYFUL HE JUST COULDN'T HOLD IN AND HIS TONGUE JUST WENT ITSHE A-CHIPPING IN AND SPITTING FIRE ALL ALONG AND BOTH OF THEM GOING IT AT ONCE LIKE A CAT CONVENTION
HE KEPT ME WITH HIM ALL THE TIME AND I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO RUN OFF
DID I GIVE YOU THE LETTER WHAT LETTER THE ONE I GOT YESTERDAY OUT OF THE POST-OFFICE NO YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME NO LETTER WELL I MUST A FORGOT IT SO HE RUMMAGED HIS POCKETS AND THEN WENT OFF SOMEWHERES WHERE HE HAD LAID IT DOWN AND FETCHED IT AND GIVE IT TO HER
 SO HE SET HIS EAR TO THE CRACK AND LISTENED AND LISTENED AND LISTENED AND THE STEPS A-SCRAPING AROUND OUT THERE ALL THE TIME
 NONE OF THE FAMILY COULDN'T BEFORE THEY DIED
THE FIRST LIGHT WE SEE WE'LL LAND A HUNDRED YARDS BELOW IT OR ABOVE IT IN A PLACE WHERE IT'S A GOOD HIDING-PLACE FOR YOU AND THE SKIFF AND THEN I'LL GO AND FIX UP SOME KIND OF A YARN AND GET SOMEBODY TO GO FOR THAT GANG AND GET THEM OUT OF THEIR SCRAPE SO THEY CAN BE HUNG WHEN THEIR TIME COMES BUT THAT IDEA WAS A FAILURE
I WAS YOUR FATHER'S FRIEND AND I'M YOUR FRIEND
 I HOPE TO GRACIOUS IF I WARN'T AFRAID THEY'D STEAL SOME O THE FAMILY
THAT'S THE THING FOR YOU TO DO BUT MY LAN MARS SID HOW'S I GWYNE TO MAKE M A WITCH PIE
 IF HE DIDN'T SHUT IT UP POWERFUL QUICK HE'D LOSE A LIE EVERY TIME
 I COULDN'T STOOD IT MUCH LONGER
NEXT DAY HE WAS DRUNK AND HE WENT TO JUDGE THATCHER'S AND BULLYRAGGED HIM AND TRIED TO MAKE HIM GIVE UP THE MONEY
 IT'S RIGHT I SHOULD SUFFERPERFECTLY RIGHTI DON'T MAKE ANY MOAN BROUGHT YOU DOWN FROM WHAR
 HE SAID IT WAS DEATH
I WON'T LET NO RUNAWAY NIGGERS GET BY ME IF I CAN HELP IT THEY WENT OFF AND I GOT ABOARD THE RAFT FEELING BAD AND LOW BECAUSE I KNOWED VERY WELL I HAD DONE WRONG AND I SEE IT WARN'T NO USE FOR ME TO TRY TO LEARN TO DO RIGHT
 WELL THEY WAS HANDSOME AND STRIPED AND THERE WARN'T NO HARM IN A MILLION OF THEM
FOR THE LAND'S SAKE WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THE CHILD
ONE THING I KNOWTHERE'S A GRAVE SOMEWHERE FOR ME
 I NEVER SEEN ANYBODY BUT LIED ONE TIME OR ANOTHER WITHOUT IT WAS AUNT POLLY OR THE WIDOW OR MAYBE MARY
 IT WAS LECTION DAY AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO AND VOTE MYSELF IF I WARN'T TOO DRUNK TO GET THERE
WELL AS I WAS SAYING WE WAITED THAT MORNING TILL EVERYBODY WAS SETTLED DOWN TO BUSINESS AND NOBODY IN SIGHT AROUND THE YARD
WELL I TELL YOU WHAT I THINK
 I'LL LEARN PEOPLE TO BRING UP A BOY TO PUT ON AIRS OVER HIS OWN FATHER AND LET ON TO BE BETTER'N WHAT HE IS
INDEED HE WOULDN'T
IT DOES BEAT ALL HOW NEAT THE NIGGERS PLAYED THEIR HAND
 WHEN ME AND THE KING AND THE DUKE GOT HOME TO THE RAFT WE ALL HAD A SUPPER
 MISFORTUNE HAS BROKEN MY ONCE HAUGHTY SPIRIT
SOMETIMES THEY WASH THEM OVER WITH RED WATER-PAINT THAT THEY CALL SPANISH-BROWN SAME AS THEY DO IN TOWN
 HE WARN'T A BOY TO MEEKY ALONG UP THAT YARD LIKE A SHEEP
 BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS KILL
 HIS HAIR WAS LONG AND TANGLED AND GREASY AND HUNG DOWN AND YOU COULD SEE HIS EYES SHINING THROUGH LIKE HE WAS BEHIND VINES
 I PEEPED THROUGH A CRACK OF THE DINING-ROOM DOOR AND SEE THE MEN THAT WAS WATCHING THE CORPSE ALL SOUND ASLEEP ON THEIR CHAIRS
 BY AND BY TOM SAYS
AND THEN I KNOWED FOR CERTAIN I WISHED I WAS DEADFOR THAT IS THE LONESOMEST SOUND IN THE WHOLE WORLD
AND QUICKER TOO PRISONERS DON'T HAVE GEESE RUNNING AROUND THE DONJON-KEEP TO PULL PENS OUT OF YOU MUGGINS
 DID YOU COME FOR YOUR INTEREST NO SIR I SAYS
 IT AIN'T NO CRIME IN A PRISONER TO STEAL THE THING HE NEEDS TO GET AWAY WITH TOM SAID
THOUGH I USED TO TAKE TO THE WOODS MOST OF THE TIME WHEN HE WAS AROUND
WELL THE FUNERAL SERMON WAS VERY GOOD BUT PISON LONG AND TIRESOME
BUT THEM PEOPLE NEVER TOOK NO NOTICE OF IT THEY WAS SO FULL OF THIS BUSINESS
JIM MADE A FLOOR FOR THE WIGWAM AND RAISED IT A FOOT OR MORE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE RAFT SO NOW THE BLANKETS AND ALL THE TRAPS WAS OUT OF REACH OF STEAMBOAT WAVES
BUT IT WOULDN'T FOR ME BECAUSE I DO KNOW BETTER
 THIS AIN'T NO BAD THING THAT WE'VE STRUCK HEREPLENTY GRUB AND AN EASY LIFECOME GIVE US YOUR HAND DUKE AND LE'S ALL BE FRIENDS THE DUKE DONE IT AND JIM AND ME WAS PRETTY GLAD TO SEE IT
 AND ALWAYS IS
ANYWAY SAYS I IT'S WORTH THE TROUBLE TO GIVE THE PLACE A HUNT
 AND S'POSE HE STEPS IN HERE ANY MINUTE AND SINGS OUT MY NAME BEFORE I CAN THROW HIM A WINK TO KEEP QUIET
HE GOT TO HANGING AROUND THE WIDOW'S TOO MUCH AND SO SHE TOLD HIM AT LAST THAT IF HE DIDN'T QUIT USING AROUND THERE SHE WOULD MAKE TROUBLE FOR HIM
DO YOU BELONG ON IT YES SIR ANY MEN ON IT ONLY ONE SIR WELL THERE'S FIVE NIGGERS RUN OFF TO-NIGHT UP YONDER ABOVE THE HEAD OF THE BEND
HE MADE ME TAKE OFF THE RATTLES AND TIE THEM AROUND HIS WRIST TOO
BUT WHEN WE WAS DRAGGING HIM TO THE BOAT AND THE MAN LEFT ME A-HOLT OF THE ROPE AND WENT BEHIND HIM TO SHOVE HIM ALONG HE WAS TOO STRONG FOR ME AND JERKED LOOSE AND RUN AND WE AFTER HIM
BUT HERE WE'RE A-RUNNING ON THIS WAY AND YOU HAIN'T TOLD ME A WORD ABOUT SIS NOR ANY OF THEM
THE WAGON WAS SPINNING UP THE ROAD FOR THE VILLAGE AND WE WAS ALL BUNCHED IN THE FRONT DOOR
 THE SKY LOOKS EVER SO DEEP WHEN YOU LAY DOWN ON YOUR BACK IN THE MOONSHINE
AND UP SHE COMES NEXT MORNING CHOP OFF HER HEAD'AND THEY CHOP IT OFF
 BUT THERE'S NO HOPE THAT HE'S COME
 BOYS WE DONE IT ELEGANT!'DEED WE DID
WE BEEN EXPECTING YOU A COUPLE OF DAYS AND MORE
 I WAKED UP ABOUT DAWN AND WAS A-GOING TO TURN OVER AND GO TO SLEEP AGAIN WHEN I NOTICED HOW STILL IT WASDIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANYBODY STIRRING
BUT I TOLD TOM AS QUICK AS I COULD WE MUST JUMP FOR IT NOW AND NOT A MINUTE TO LOSETHE HOUSE FULL OF MEN YONDER WITH GUNS
 MY NIGGER HAD A MONSTROUS EASY TIME BECAUSE I WARN'T USED TO HAVING ANYBODY DO ANYTHING FOR ME BUT BUCK'S WAS ON THE JUMP MOST OF THE TIME
 I MADE TWO MILE AND A HALF AND THEN STRUCK OUT A QUARTER OF A MILE OR MORE TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER BECAUSE PRETTY SOON I WOULD BE PASSING THE FERRY LANDING AND PEOPLE MIGHT SEE ME AND HAIL ME
 _THAT'S THE KIND
BUT HE TURNED AROUND TO THE CROWD AND SAYS ABOUT LIKE THIS
SO THEN I GOT A SHOVEL AND THEN WE PICKED AND SHOVELED TURN ABOUT AND MADE THE FUR FLY
 YOU COULDN'T GET HER TO TAKE A-HOLT OF ONE OF THEM WITH THE TONGS
THE DOCTOR.UNCLE SILAS.SISTER HOTCHKISS.AUNT SALLY IN TROUBLE
MF
MF
IS SOMETHING GONE WRONG THE KING WHIRLS ON ME AND RIPS OUT
 I BEAT IT AND HACKED IT CONSIDERABLE A-DOING IT
BUT IF YOU'LL TAKE MY ADVICE YOU'LL LET ME BORROW A SHEET OFF OF THE CLOTHESLINE HE SAID THAT WOULD DO
THEN THE COUSINS CHIP INAND BY AND BY EVERYBODY'S KILLED OFF AND THERE AIN'T NO MORE FEUD
 HE WAS STICKING UP A BILL FOR THE ROYAL NONESUCHTHREE-NIGHT PERFORMANCELIKE THAT OTHER TIME
 HE WAS GONE UP THE RIVER
 OFTEN THEY DO THAT AND TRY TO SEE HOW CLOSE THEY CAN COME WITHOUT TOUCHING
LE'S KEEP ON LOOKING AROUND BETWIXT THE HUT AND THE FENCE ON THE BACK SIDE WAS A LEAN-TO THAT JOINED THE HUT AT THE EAVES AND WAS MADE OUT OF PLANK
OPE NOT THY PONDEROUS AND MARBLE JAWS
S'POSE SHE DUG HIM UP AND DIDN'T FIND NOTHING WHAT WOULD SHE THINK OF ME
BUT HE COULDN'T AND THEN HE SWORE HE'D MAKE THE LAW FORCE HIM
 THEY GET DOWN ON A THING WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
 WHEN I WAS ABOUT THE MIDDLE I HEARD THE CLOCK BEGIN TO STRIKE SO I STOPS AND LISTENS
EVERYTHING SHOWS IT S'I
AND WE'LL TAKE AND TIE HIM AND KEEP HIM AND SHOVE OUT DOWN THE RIVER
 I RANGED UP AND SAYS
 BUT ANYWAY ONE THING IS PROVED_THESE TWO AIN'T EITHER OF EM WILKSES"AND HE WAGGED HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE KING AND THE DUKE
 SHE PULLED ME IN AND SHUT THE DOOR
DEED YOU AIN'T  YOU NEVER SAID NO TRUER THING N THAT YOU BET YOU AND ONCE HE SAID
 I BEGUN TO LAY FOR A CHANCE
 I GOT TO BE MOVING ALONG
 DEAR DEAR IT DOES SEEM LIKE I COULD EAT YOU UP
 WE WANT A LITTLE SOMETHING TO ANSWER ENCORES WITH ANYWAY WHAT'S ONKORES BILGEWATER THE DUKE TOLD HIM AND THEN SAYS
 I JUDGED I BETTER HIDE IT OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE SOMEWHERES BECAUSE IF THEY MISSED IT THEY WOULD GIVE THE HOUSE A GOOD RANSACKING
 JIM SAID HE RECKONED THE WIDOW WAS PARTLY RIGHT AND PAP WAS PARTLY RIGHT
 WHY THE RUNAWAY NIGGER OF COURSE
 THEY ALL SAID ITEVERY ONE OF THEM
 AS SOON AS THEY WAS OUT OF SIGHT I SUNG OUT TO BUCK AND TOLD HIM
AND BY AND BY HER WAVES WOULD GET TO US A LONG TIME AFTER SHE WAS GONE AND JOGGLE THE RAFT A BIT AND AFTER THAT YOU WOULDN'T HEAR NOTHING FOR YOU COULDN'T TELL HOW LONG EXCEPT MAYBE FROGS OR SOMETHING
 ABOUT THAT TIME I HEARS THEIR FOOTSTEPS COMING AND WAS GOING TO SKIP UNDER THE BED
THEN THE KING AND THE DUKE WOULD MAKE IT WARM FOR ME
AND THAT'S EASY FIXED TOOLS  I SAYS
 BY AND BY ONE DAY I ASKED MISS WATSON TO TRY FOR ME BUT SHE SAID I WAS A FOOL
 SOME MEN CROWDED AROUND HIM AND TRIED TO GET HIM TO SHUT UP BUT HE WOULDN'T
 HE LEFT A LETTER BEHIND FOR HARVEY AND SAID HE'D TOLD IN IT WHERE HIS MONEY WAS HID AND HOW HE WANTED THE REST OF THE PROPERTY DIVIDED UP SO GEORGE'S G'YIRLS WOULD BE ALL RIGHTFOR GEORGE DIDN'T LEAVE NOTHING
 THAT OLD FOOL SOLD HIM AND NEVER DIVIDED WITH ME AND THE MONEY'S GONE SOLD HIM  I SAYS AND BEGUN TO CRY
THEN THEY TUCKED THE OLD MAN INTO A BEAUTIFUL ROOM WHICH WAS THE SPARE ROOM AND IN THE NIGHT SOME TIME HE GOT POWERFUL THIRSTY AND CLUMB OUT ON TO THE PORCH-ROOF AND SLID DOWN A STANCHION AND TRADED HIS NEW COAT FOR A JUG OF FORTY-ROD AND CLUMB BACK AGAIN AND HAD A GOOD OLD TIME
 THERE WAS SOME BOOKS TOO PILED UP PERFECTLY EXACT ON EACH CORNER OF THE TABLE
 DEY'S TWO GALS FLYIN BOUT YOU IN YO LIFE
 HE WAS THE MOST DOWN ON SOLOMON OF ANY NIGGER I EVER SEE
 NOI DASN'T DO IT
I CAN DO IT MYSELF
 BUT AT SUPPER AT NIGHT ONE OF THE LITTLE BOYS SAYS
CHAPTER XXIV
AND I WONDERED WHAT THEM FELLOWS WOULD SAY TO ME IF THEY CATCHED ME
 TOM SAWYER A NIGGER-STEALER OH SHUCKS  I SAYS
CHAPTER XXII
CHAPTER XXII
RICHARD III
 NOW WE'RE TRYING TO DO YOU A KINDNESS
 WE'LL KEEP THEM TILL THEY'RE RANSOMED TO DEATH
PAP SAID HE'D BEEN A MAN THAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD BEFORE AND THE JUDGE SAID HE BELIEVED IT
CHAPTER XIX
CHAPTER XIX
 HAIN'T WE GOT ALL THE FOOLS IN TOWN ON OUR SIDE
BLAME IT I SAYS I MIGHT GET HUNTED UP AND JAILED
 SAID IT WARN'T NO FAIR TEST
 I HID THE LETTER BEHIND THE FIRST THING THAT COME HANDY AND RUSHED
 DEY AIN NO RAF NO MO
 THE OLD LADY TOOK CARE OF THE ROOM HERSELF THOUGH THERE WAS PLENTY OF NIGGERS AND SHE SEWED THERE A GOOD DEAL AND READ HER BIBLE THERE MOSTLY
AND NEXT MY BACK RIGHT BETWEEN MY SHOULDERS
I NEVER HEARD OF THEM WELL THAT MAY BE SO AND IT MAYN'T
BLEST IF I KIN SEE DE PINT
 HE WORE OUT BY AND BY AND LAID STILL A WHILE MOANING
 WELL WELL WELL
 I CLOSED IN ABOVE THE SHORE LIGHT AND LAID ON MY OARS AND FLOATED
 SO THERE I WAS
IT'S MOST UNCOMMON CURIOUS I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT
AND WHEN I GOT HERE I TOLD JIM TO HURRY OR THEY'D CATCH ME AND HANG ME YET AND SAID I WAS AFEARD YOU AND THE DUKE WASN'T ALIVE NOW AND I WAS AWFUL SORRY AND SO WAS JIM AND WAS AWFUL GLAD WHEN WE SEE YOU COMING
 YOU ALWAYS WANT MORE'N YOUR SHARE OF THE TRUCK AND YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT IT TOO BECAUSE YOU'VE SWORE T IF YOU DIDN'T YOU'D TELL
 HE NEVER DONE NOTHING TO ME WELL THEN WHAT DID YOU WANT TO KILL HIM FOR WHY NOTHINGONLY IT'S ON ACCOUNT OF THE FEUD WHAT'S A FEUD WHY WHERE WAS YOU RAISED
 HE MUST A COME
 HE MUST A COME
THAT'S ONE MISTAKE AND THE OTHER IS THAT YOU DIDN'T COME IN THE DARK AND FETCH YOUR MASKS
 I WENT AND TOLD THE WIDOW ABOUT IT AND SHE SAID THE THING A BODY COULD GET BY PRAYING FOR IT WAS SPIRITUAL GIFTS  THIS WAS TOO MANY FOR ME BUT SHE TOLD ME WHAT SHE MEANTI MUST HELP OTHER PEOPLE AND DO EVERYTHING I COULD FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND LOOK OUT FOR THEM ALL THE TIME AND NEVER THINK ABOUT MYSELF
 TOM AND ME FOUND THE MONEY THAT THE ROBBERS HID IN THE CAVE AND IT MADE US RICH
DOAN TALK TO ME_SIGNS IS SIGNS MINE I TELL YOU
HE SET THERE A-LOOKING AT ME WITH HIS CHAIR TILTED BACK A LITTLE
ONE DAY BUCK AND ME WAS AWAY OUT IN THE WOODS HUNTING AND HEARD A HORSE COMING
 I KNOWED HE WOULD SEE I WAS WET AND THEN HE WOULD BE ASKING QUESTIONS
 WELL THAT LET ME OUT
THIS IS A THIRTY-EIGHT YEAR JOB TOM SAWYER HE NEVER SAID NOTHING
 BOB IF YOU AND TOM ARE READY TAKE YOUR PLACES ALL READY NOW GEORGE JACKSON DO YOU KNOW THE SHEPHERDSONS NO SIR
 IN THEM CIRCUMSTANCES IT WARN'T NO TROUBLE TO HIM TO THROW IN AN AMOUNT OF STYLE THAT WAS SUITABLE
SAID HE HAD PLAYED A DEEF AND DUMB PERSON ON THE HISTRONIC BOARDS
 THIS LETTER SAID
OH SHE'LL DO
WHEN HE GOT ALONG I WAS HARD AT IT TAKING UP A TROT LINE
 I COULDN'T LOOK UP YET
I READ CONSIDERABLE TO JIM ABOUT KINGS AND DUKES AND EARLS AND SUCH AND HOW GAUDY THEY DRESSED AND HOW MUCH STYLE THEY PUT ON AND CALLED EACH OTHER YOUR MAJESTY AND YOUR GRACE AND YOUR LORDSHIP AND SO ON STEAD OF MISTER
 BILL WANTED TO KILL TURNER
OH THIS AIN'T BULLY NOR NOTH'N
 IF SHE WAS TO FETCH IN HELP I'D GET MIXED UP IN THE BUSINESS BEFORE IT WAS DONE WITH I JUDGE
 THERE'S ONE WAY YETLET'S GO AND DIG UP THE CORPSE AND LOOK THAT TOOK THEM
AND THERE WARN'T NO FLOOR TO THE SHED NOR NOTHING IN IT BUT SOME OLD RUSTY PLAYED-OUT HOES AND SPADES AND PICKS AND A CRIPPLED PLOW
 WHAT'S THE GOOD OF A PLAN THAT AIN'T NO MORE TROUBLE THAN THAT
I YIELD I SUBMIT
 WELL I CAN TELL YOU IT MADE ME ALL OVER TREMBLY AND FEVERISH TOO TO HEAR HIM BECAUSE I BEGUN TO GET IT THROUGH MY HEAD THAT HE WAS MOST FREEAND WHO WAS TO BLAME FOR IT
AND SO DID EVERYBODY ELSE EXCEPT THREE OR FOUR OR MAYBE HALF A DOZEN
 I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT NO WAY AT ALL
 UP-STREAM BOATS DIDN'T GENERLY COME CLOSE TO US
AND A LOOK'N'-GLASS
 AND THERE AIN'T NO OTHER WAY THAT EVER I HEARD OF AND I'VE READ ALL THE BOOKS THAT GIVES ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THESE THINGS
AND I'LL GO TOWARDS TOWN A PIECE AND TAKE A FRESH START AND GET THERE A QUARTER OR A HALF AN HOUR AFTER YOU
 'FETCH UP NELL GWYNN HE SAYS
AND WHATEVER YOU DO MANAGE TO DO WITH M ALL IS MORE'N I CAN MAKE OUT
AND AT LAST I STRUCK THE TIME I SAVED HIM BY TELLING THE MEN WE HAD SMALL-POX ABOARD AND HE WAS SO GRATEFUL AND SAID I WAS THE BEST FRIEND OLD JIM EVER HAD IN THE WORLD AND THE ONLY ONE HE'S GOT NOW
ME-YOW AS SOFT AS I COULD AND THEN I PUT OUT THE LIGHT AND SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE WINDOW ON TO THE SHED
 BUT I'LL DO IT EF I GOT TO
AND HE GOT A LITTLE WORSE AND A LITTLE WORSE AND AFTER A LONG TIME HE WENT OUT OF HIS HEAD AND WOULDN'T LET ME COME A-NIGH HIM ANY MORE AND SAID IF I CHALKED HIS RAFT HE'D KILL ME AND NO END OF WILD FOOLISHNESS LIKE THAT AND I SEE I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL WITH HIM
LE'S LAND ON HER JIM BUT JIM WAS DEAD AGAINST IT AT FIRST
THE SOUND COME FAINT OVER THE WATER BUT CLEARELEVEN
 IT'S THE WAY THEY ALWAYS DO WHY MARS TOM I LAY I KIN RAISE ONE ER DEM MULLEN-STALKS TWYSTE WID SPRING WATER WHILES ANOTHER MAN'S A START'N ONE WID TEARS THAT AIN'T THE IDEA
AND THE GREEN BLACKBERRIES WAS JUST BEGINNING TO SHOW
 I'LL THINK THE THING OVERI'LL INVENT A PLAN THAT'LL FIX IT
 WHAT WILL HE DO THEN
AND ALL THE CLOUDS THAT LOWERED O'ER OUR HOUSETOPS WITH THIS REGARD THEIR CURRENTS TURN AWRY AND LOSE THE NAME OF ACTION
WHAT WAS YOUR IDEA FOR ASKING ME HE SAYS
JUST AS I WAS PASSING A PLACE WHERE A KIND OF A COWPATH CROSSED THE CRICK HERE COMES A COUPLE OF MEN TEARING UP THE PATH AS TIGHT AS THEY COULD FOOT IT
BUT WHAT PUT THAT INTO YOUR HEAD WHAT PUT IT DAR
 WELL THEN WHAT KIND O BROTHERS WOULD IT BE THAT D STAND IN HIS WAY AT SECH A TIME
AND PRISONERS DON'T CARE HOW THEY GET A THING SO THEY GET IT AND NOBODY DON'T BLAME THEM FOR IT EITHER
AND SOMETIMES I LIFTED A CHICKEN THAT WARN'T ROOSTING COMFORTABLE AND TOOK HIM ALONG
 AND THERE'S A REWARD OUT FOR OLD FINN TOOTWO HUNDRED DOLLARS
 DO YOU OWN A DOG
BUT HE SAID AS THIS WAS THE LAST DAY OF THE CAMP-MEETING HE COULDN'T DO NO GOOD AND BESIDES HE WAS IN A SWEAT TO GET TO THE INDIAN OCEAN RIGHT OFF AND GO TO WORK ON THE PIRATES
 AND BESIDES HE SAID THEM LITTLE BIRDS HAD SAID IT WAS GOING TO RAIN AND DID I WANT THE THINGS TO GET WET
THIS WAS THE MOST AWFUL TROUBLE AND MOST DANGERSOME I EVER WAS IN
 I WAS JUST STARTING DOWN THE LADDER AND I SEE THEM WELL GO ON GO ON
 YOU MIGHT WANT IT SO SHE PUT ME UP A SNACK AND SAYS
 I'M FOR KNOCKING OFF AND LIGHTING OUT THAT MADE ME FEEL PRETTY BAD
THEY WAS SETTING AROUND SOME OF THEM TALKING A LITTLE IN A LOW VOICE AND ALL OF THEM FIDGETY AND UNEASY BUT TRYING TO LOOK LIKE THEY WARN'T
 WE COME IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE BUNCH OF LIGHTS BY AND BYTHAT WAS THE TOWN YOU KNOWAND SLID BY ABOUT A HALF A MILE OUT ALL RIGHT
UNCLE SILAS HE SAYS
 BUT THE KING WAS CA'M
 I SAYS TO MYSELF IF A BODY CAN GET ANYTHING THEY PRAY FOR WHY DON'T DEACON WINN GET BACK THE MONEY HE LOST ON PORK
 BY ONE OF THE PARROTS WAS A CAT MADE OF CROCKERY AND A CROCKERY DOG BY THE OTHER
 WHY DIDN'T YOU GET MUD-TURKLES HOW YOU GWYNE TO GIT M
I RECKONED THEY WAS USED TO HAVING FUN OUT OF BOGGS
OH COME TO THE MOURNERS BENCH
 BUT I DON'T CARE I DON'T MIND THE TERMSI'D BE WILLING TO STAND A THOUSAND SUCH JOKES TO HAVE YOU HERE
 SO I SAID I DIDN'T CARE WHAT WAS THE REASON THEY DIDN'T GET US AS LONG AS THEY DIDN'T
 IT AIN'T ANYTHING
HERE IS MY ANSWER  SHE HOVE UP THE BAG OF MONEY AND PUT IT IN THE KING'S HANDS AND SAYS TAKE THIS SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS AND INVEST FOR ME AND MY SISTERS ANY WAY YOU WANT TO AND DON'T GIVE US NO RECEIPT FOR IT THEN SHE PUT HER ARM AROUND THE KING ON ONE SIDE AND SUSAN AND THE HARE-LIP DONE THE SAME ON THE OTHER
AND THEN THEY WOULD BOTH WORK TO BUY THE TWO CHILDREN AND IF THEIR MASTER WOULDN'T SELL THEM THEY'D GET AN AB'LITIONIST TO GO AND STEAL THEM
 BUT HE'S LUCKY DEY SAY EN I SEE I WARN'T LUCKY
THERE WOULDN'T NOTHING GO WRONG AGAIN FOR A WEEK
 IT'S JIST AS I WAS A-SAYIN TO BRER PHELPS HIS OWN SELF
YOU TOM WELL_WHAT HE SAYS KIND OF PETTISH
 I SEE I WAS WEAKENING
 I SAYS TO MYSELF I CAN FIX IT NOW SO NOBODY WON'T THINK OF FOLLOWING ME
 I MUST GO UP THE ROAD AND WAYLAY HIM
JUST A BEAUTY TOO ABOUT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN FOOT LONG RIDING HIGH LIKE A DUCK
HE COME BACK ABOUT TEN A LITTLE BIT UNEASY
 I'LL FETCH GOSHEN BEFORE DAYLIGHT HOLD ON A MINUTE
N MOREOVER S'I A DOZEN SAYS YOU!_FORTY COULDN'T A DONE EVERY THING THAT'S BEEN DONE
AND NEXT WHEN IT WAS JUST ABOUT THE BLUEST AND BLACKEST_FST
 I HAD MY DOUBTS WHEN YOU TOLD ME
 BUT THERE WARN'T NO TIME TO SWAP KNIVES
BUT I SEE THERE WARN'T NOBODY IN THERE BUT THE REMAINDERS OF PETER
THAT WAS THE THING THAT WAS TOO MANY FOR ME
 I COULD ALWAYS STAY UNDER WATER A MINUTE
 HE WAS A GENTLEMAN ALL OVER
 IT'S A VERY GOOD WAY AND SO IS THE NONNAMOUS LETTERS
CHAPTER XVIII
CHAPTER XVIII
SO AT LAST BUD SEEN IT WARN'T ANY USE SO HE STOPPED AND FACED AROUND SO AS TO HAVE THE BULLET HOLES IN FRONT YOU KNOW AND THE OLD MAN HE RODE UP AND SHOT HIM DOWN
 YOU'D SEE THEM DRIPPING FROM THE RAFTERS AND PLACES EVERY NOW AND THEN
DOWN TO SILAS PHELPS PLACE TWO MILE BELOW HERE
AND IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS HE GOT DRUNK AND FELL OFF OF THE SHOT-TOWER AND SPREAD HIMSELF OUT SO THAT HE WAS JUST A KIND OF A LAYER AS YOU MAY SAY
 THEN THERE WAS A FINE TIME
 KEEP THE RIVER ROAD ALL THE WAY AND NEXT TIME YOU TRAMP TAKE SHOES AND SOCKS WITH YOU
HE WAS DEAD
WELL ONE THING WAS DEAD SURE AND THAT WAS THAT TOM SAWYER WAS IN EARNEST AND WAS ACTULY GOING TO HELP STEAL THAT NIGGER OUT OF SLAVERY
BUT MOSTLY THEY HANG ROUND THE HAREM ROUN DE WHICH HAREM WHAT'S DE HAREM THE PLACE WHERE HE KEEPS HIS WIVES
 THAT WE REALLY DIG RIGHT IN AS QUICK AS WE CAN
 SO IF WE DON'T GIVE THEM NOTICE THERE WON'T BE NOBODY NOR NOTHING TO INTERFERE WITH US AND SO AFTER ALL OUR HARD WORK AND TROUBLE THIS ESCAPE LL GO OFF PERFECTLY FLAT
 SHE SAYS TELL THEM TO GIVE UNCLE HARVEY AND WILLIAM MY LOVE AND A KISS AND SAY I'VE RUN OVER THE RIVER TO SEE MR.'MR.WHAT IS THE NAME OF THAT RICH FAMILY YOUR UNCLE PETER USED TO THINK SO MUCH OF?I MEAN THE ONE THAT WHY YOU MUST MEAN THE APTHORPS AIN'T IT OF COURSE
 AND A LEG WOULD BE BETTER STILL
THINKS AS LONG AS HE CAN HIDE IT IT AIN'T NO DISGRACE
 TOM WAS OVER THE STILE AND STARTING FOR THE HOUSE
IT WAS VERY GOOD POETRY
THE OLDEST GRAY AND ABOUT SIXTY THE OTHER TWO THIRTY OR MOREALL OF THEM FINE AND HANDSOMEAND THE SWEETEST OLD GRAY-HEADED LADY AND BACK OF HER TWO YOUNG WOMEN WHICH I COULDN'T SEE RIGHT WELL
 DAT JACK'S A GOOD NIGGER EN POOTY SMART YES HE IS
HE WAS SUNSHINE MOST ALWAYSI MEAN HE MADE IT SEEM LIKE GOOD WEATHER
 I'M JIST A-FREEZN FOR SOMETHING FRESH ANYWAY
HOW DOES HE GO AT ITGIVE NOTICE?GIVE THE COUNTRY A SHOW
HADN'T RUN ACROSS TOM'S TRACK
 THE BENCHES WAS MADE OUT OF OUTSIDE SLABS OF LOGS WITH HOLES BORED IN THE ROUND SIDE TO DRIVE STICKS INTO FOR LEGS
YOU'RE JOKING I AIN'T JOKING EITHER WELL THEN I SAYS JOKING OR NO JOKING IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING SAID ABOUT A RUNAWAY NIGGER DON'T FORGET TO REMEMBER THAT YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM AND I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM THEN WE TOOK THE TRUNK AND PUT IT IN MY WAGON AND HE DROVE OFF HIS WAY AND I DROVE MINE
 IT WAS BECAUSE MY HEART WARN'T RIGHT
WHY BECAUSE MARY JANE LL BE IN MOURNING FROM THIS OUT
I COULDN'T HELP IT
BUT YOU SEE I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT PLAY-ACTIN AND HAIN'T EVER SEEN MUCH OF IT
 BUT TOM SAID ALL WOMEN WAS JUST SO
 IT MIGHT ANSWER FOR YOU TO DIG JIM OUT WITH A PICK WITHOUT ANY LETTING ON BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW NO BETTER
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET SCARED THAT WAY AND IT KEEPS RUNNING ON AND GETTING WORSE AND WORSE ALL THE TIME AND YOUR WITS GETS TO ADDLING AND YOU GET TO DOING ALL SORTS O WILD THINGS AND BY AND BY YOU THINK TO YOURSELF SPOS'N I WAS A BOY AND WAS AWAY UP THERE AND THE DOOR AIN'T LOCKED AND YOU SHE STOPPED LOOKING KIND OF WONDERING AND THEN SHE TURNED HER HEAD AROUND SLOW AND WHEN HER EYE LIT ON MEI GOT UP AND TOOK A WALK
YOU'D A DONE IT IF YOU COULD I RECKON
BUT I TOLD HIM I FELL IN THE RIVER AND THAT WAS WHAT MADE ME SO LONG
TELL EM TO DART YOU OUT TO JIM HORNBACK'S AND HE'LL FOOT THE BILL
 BY AND BY SAYS I HEL-_LO JIM LOOKY YONDER IT WAS A STEAMBOAT THAT HAD KILLED HERSELF ON A ROCK
BUT THEN THERE WAS WAYS TO PUT IT OFF A LONG TIME AND JUDGE THATCHER KNOWED HOW TO DO IT
FOR MY NIECE HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO THE DREADFUL PLURIBUS-UNUM MUMPS AND SO IT'S MY BOUNDEN DUTY TO SET DOWN HERE AND WAIT THE THREE MONTHS IT TAKES TO SHOW ON HER IF SHE'S GOT IT  BUT NEVER MIND IF YOU THINK IT'S BEST TO TELL YOUR UNCLE HARVEY SHUCKS AND STAY FOOLING AROUND HERE WHEN WE COULD ALL BE HAVING GOOD TIMES IN ENGLAND WHILST WE WAS WAITING TO FIND OUT WHETHER MARY JANE'S GOT IT OR NOT
WELL I'M PUZZLED
 YOU MUST A MISSED HIM
 IT'S THE WORST IMITATION I EVER HEARD
SO WHEN HE SEES ME GETTING THE CANOE READY HE SAYS
 HOUSE WAS JAMMED AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND WE SOLD THIS CROWD THE SAME WAY
 THAT OLD GENTLEMAN THAT HAD JUST COME LOOKED ALL PUZZLED TO DEATH
 MISS HOOKER SHE TOLE ME PARTICULAR THAT HER UNCLE HORNBACK GREAT GUNS
AND A COUPLE OF GULES FOR SUPPORTERS WHICH IS YOU AND ME
SO SOMETIMES WHEN I WENT UP THERE WITH A LOT OF OUR FOLKS I USED TO SEE A LOT OF THE SHEPHERDSONS THERE ON THEIR FINE HORSES
 HE AIN'T EVER TOLD ME YOU WAS HERE
 THEN HIS NEXT MOVE WILL BE TO ADVERTISE JIM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
 THEY COULDN'T GET THE CHAIN OFF SO THEY JUST CUT THEIR HAND OFF AND SHOVED
 THEY ARE AS TALL AS A TREE AND AS BIG AROUND AS A CHURCH WELL I SAYS S'POSE WE GOT SOME GENIES TO HELP US_CAN'T WE LICK THE OTHER CROWD THEN HOW YOU GOING TO GET THEM I DON'T KNOW
AND JUST AS WE WAS LEAVING I FOUND A TOLERABLE GOOD CURRY-COMB AND JIM HE FOUND A RATTY OLD FIDDLE-BOW AND A WOODEN LEG
 IN ANOTHER SECOND I WOULD A BEEN ABOARD OF HER BUT JUST THEN THE DOOR OPENED
 I CRAWFISHED AS FAST AS I COULD ABOUT TWO YARDS BUT THE BOAT SLANTED SO THAT I COULDN'T MAKE VERY GOOD TIME
 THEY WAS DIFFERENT FROM ANY PICTURES I EVER SEE BEFOREBLACKER MOSTLY THAN IS COMMON
NO NOBODY SAYS THEY
BUT THE WAY HE WORKED FOR THE NEXT HALF AN HOUR SHOWED ABOUT HOW HE WAS SCARED
 WE COULD SEE SAW-LOGS GO BY IN THE DAYLIGHT SOMETIMES BUT WE LET THEM GO
HERE'S THE LAW A-STANDING READY TO TAKE A MAN'S SON AWAY FROM HIMA MAN'S OWN SON WHICH HE HAS HAD ALL THE TROUBLE AND ALL THE ANXIETY AND ALL THE EXPENSE OF RAISING
AND HERE'S THESE TWO HANDWRITINGS AND ANYBODY CAN SEE THEY DIDN'T WRITE THEM THE KING AND THE DUKE LOOKED SOLD AND FOOLISH I TELL YOU TO SEE HOW THE LAWYER HAD TOOK THEM IN AND HERE'S THIS OLD GENTLEMAN'S HAND WRITING AND ANYBODY CAN TELL EASY ENOUGH HE DIDN'T WRITE THEMFACT IS THE SCRATCHES HE MAKES AIN'T PROPERLY WRITING AT ALL
 "WHY AUNTY IT COST US A POWER OF WORKWEEKS OF ITHOURS AND HOURS EVERY NIGHT WHILST YOU WAS ALL ASLEEP
BUT SHE MISSED HIM WIDE AND SAID OUCH IT HURT HER ARM SO
 I AIN'T EVER GOING TO GET SHUT OF THEMLOTS OF TIMES I DREAM ABOUT THEM
WE GOT THERE IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR FAIRLY DRIPPING FOR IT WAS A MOST AWFUL HOT DAY
JUST TELL ME EVERYTHING_TELL ME ALL ABOUT M ALL EVERY ONE OF M
 THE DOGS WERE AS STILL AS THE HUMANS BUT THEY FOLLOWED A LITTLE BEHIND ME
AND WHEN HE WANTS TO SEND ANY LITTLE COMMON ORDINARY MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE TO LET THE WORLD KNOW WHERE HE'S CAPTIVATED HE CAN WRITE IT ON THE BOTTOM OF A TIN PLATE WITH A FORK AND THROW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW
I WOULDN'T GIVE SHUCKS FOR ANY OTHER WAY
JIM SAID HE WOULD JIS S SOON HAVE TOBACKER IN HIS COFFEE AND FOUND SO MUCH FAULT WITH IT AND WITH THE WORK AND BOTHER OF RAISING THE MULLEN AND JEWS-HARPING THE RATS AND PETTING AND FLATTERING UP THE SNAKES AND SPIDERS AND THINGS ON TOP OF ALL THE OTHER WORK HE HAD TO DO ON PENS AND INSCRIPTIONS AND JOURNALS AND THINGS WHICH MADE IT MORE TROUBLE AND WORRY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO BE A PRISONER THAN ANYTHING HE EVER UNDERTOOK THAT TOM MOST LOST ALL PATIENCE WITH HIM
 WE COME TO A LITTLE FLAT PIECE OF LAND WHICH WAS DRY AND VERY THICK WITH TREES AND BUSHES AND VINES AND HE SAYS
 I'VE GOT SOME OF WILLIAM'S LETTERS TOO
 THE OLD GENTLEMAN SAYS
AND IN THE FORENOON WE TOOK IT DOWN TO THE WOODS BUT IT WOULDN'T GO INTO THE PIE
ILLUSTRATIONS
 MY SOULS HOW THE WIND DID SCREAM ALONG
 THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS FOR GOING ALONG WITH ME BUT I SAID NO I COULD DRIVE THE HORSE MYSELF AND I DRUTHER HE WOULDN'T TAKE NO TROUBLE ABOUT ME
 DOES YOU KNOW BOUT DAT CHILE DAT HE UZ GWYNE TO CHOP IN TWO YES THE WIDOW TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT WELL DEN
ANOTHER NIGHT WHEN WE WAS UP AT THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND JUST BEFORE DAYLIGHT HERE COMES A FRAME-HOUSE DOWN ON THE WEST SIDE
 IT'S JUST LIKE THE WAY IT WAS WITH THE NIGGERSIT WARN'T NO SALE AND THE NIGGERS WILL BE BACK BEFORE LONG
 HE'S PLUMB CRAZY S'I
AND DON'T YOU RECKON THEY'LL WANT CLEWS
I'M A-GOING UP AROUND THE CORNER HERE TO ROUST OUT MY ENGINEER I STRUCK FOR THE LIGHT BUT AS SOON AS HE TURNED THE CORNER I WENT BACK AND GOT INTO MY SKIFF AND BAILED HER OUT AND THEN PULLED UP SHORE IN THE EASY WATER ABOUT SIX HUNDRED YARDS AND TUCKED MYSELF IN AMONG SOME WOODBOATS
 HE WOULD A BEEN WORTH A GOOD DEAL OVER AT THE VILLAGE
 THE DUKE HAD TO LEARN HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW TO SAY EVERY SPEECH
WE WANT ONE TO MAKE A SAW OUT OF TOM IF IT AIN'T UNREGULAR AND IRRELIGIOUS TO SEJEST IT I SAYS THERE'S AN OLD RUSTY SAW-BLADE AROUND YONDER STICKING UNDER THE WEATHER-BOARDING BEHIND THE SMOKE-HOUSE HE LOOKED KIND OF WEARY AND DISCOURAGED-LIKE AND SAYS
THE MAN SUNG OUT
 BUT THE KING HE GOT THE BAG BEFORE I COULD THINK MORE THAN ABOUT A HALF A THOUGHT AND HE NEVER SUSPICIONED I WAS AROUND
BUT I WON'T GO
 IT MOST GIVE ME THE FAN-TODS
 HAIN'T WE GOT TO SAW THE LEG OF JIM'S BED OFF SO AS TO GET THE CHAIN LOOSE WHY YOU JUST SAID A BODY COULD LIFT UP THE BEDSTEAD AND SLIP THE CHAIN OFF WELL IF THAT AIN'T JUST LIKE YOU HUCK FINN
 I COULD SEE THEM FIRST-RATE BUT THEY COULDN'T SEE ME
 WE WARN'T LOOKING FOR YOU AT ALL BUT ONLY TOM
 WE STRUCK FOR THE STERN OF THE TEXAS AND FOUND IT AND THEN SCRABBLED ALONG FORWARDS ON THE SKYLIGHT HANGING ON FROM SHUTTER TO SHUTTER FOR THE EDGE OF THE SKYLIGHT WAS IN THE WATER
 I CAN'T EVER GET IT OUT OF MY MEMORY THE SIGHT OF THEM POOR MISERABLE GIRLS AND NIGGERS HANGING AROUND EACH OTHER'S NECKS AND CRYING
ON THE ROAD TOM HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT HOW IT WAS RECKONED I WAS MURDERED AND HOW PAP DISAPPEARED PRETTY SOON AND DIDN'T COME BACK NO MORE AND WHAT A STIR THERE WAS WHEN JIM RUN AWAY
 IT STARTED THIRTY YEAR AGO OR SOM'ERS ALONG THERE
AND I DON'T GIVE A DEAD RAT WHAT THE AUTHORITIES THINKS ABOUT IT NUTHER WELL HE SAYS THERE'S EXCUSE FOR PICKS AND LETTING-ON IN A CASE LIKE THIS
AND YOU COULDN'T GO IF THERE WAS
IT WAS TOO NARROW
 TELL HIM I'LL HAVE HIS NIECE ALL SAFE BEFORE HE CAN GET TO TOWN
 THE AVERAGE MAN DON'T LIKE TROUBLE AND DANGER
 NOW WHILST I THINK OF IT WE GOT TO HUNT UP SOMETHING TO MAKE A SAW OUT OF THE FIRST CHANCE WE GET WHAT DO WE WANT OF A SAW WHAT DO WE WANT OF IT
 SHE WAS A BIG ONE AND SHE WAS COMING IN A HURRY TOO LOOKING LIKE A BLACK CLOUD WITH ROWS OF GLOW-WORMS AROUND IT
OF COURSE THAT WAS ALL RIGHT BECAUSE SHE DONE IT HERSELF
WHAT'S THE VITTLES FOR
 AND I EXPLAINED ALL ABOUT HOW WE BLOWED OUT A CYLINDER-HEAD AT THE MOUTH OF WHITE RIVER AND IT TOOK US THREE DAYS TO FIX IT
AND I RECKON MINE DID TOO
 THERE WAS A BOY'S OLD SPECKLED STRAW HAT ON THE FLOOR
 AND I'LL START THIS VERY AFTERNOON NO YOU WONT YOU'LL START NOW
CHAPTER XXVI
AND I RECKON THEY MUST A BEEN SPERITSBECAUSE YOU KNOW OUR DOGS AND THER AIN'T NO BETTER
WE GOT TO GO AND FETCH JIM
JIM LAID IT IN WITH ALL HIS MIGHT FOR HE WAS MOST ABOUT STARVED
AND NEXT I HEAR PEOPLE'S VOICES
AND IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO KEEP FROM CRYING
THEN I JUMPED IN THE CANOE AND DUG OUT FOR OUR PLACE A MILE AND A HALF BELOW AS HARD AS I COULD GO
 WE FOUND A BRASS BUTTON IN HIS STOMACH AND A ROUND BALL AND LOTS OF RUBBAGE
 AND I PEEPED OUT AND IN A LITTLE WHILE TOM'S AUNT POLLY SHOOK HERSELF LOOSE AND STOOD THERE LOOKING ACROSS AT TOM OVER HER SPECTACLESKIND OF GRINDING HIM INTO THE EARTH YOU KNOW
 THE KING SINGS OUT
 I'LL KEEP IT
THAT NIGHT ABOUT TEN WE HOVE IN SIGHT OF THE LIGHTS OF A TOWN AWAY DOWN IN A LEFT-HAND BEND
 THEN I TURNED IN WITH MY CLOTHES ALL ON
THEY SAID YOU WOULD AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON A COUPLE OF LITTLE BOATS COME ALONG BUT THEY DIDN'T COME FROM HIGH ENOUGH UP THE RIVER
AND WHEN THEY FOUND WE ONLY WANTED TO GO FOUR OR FIVE MILE THEY WAS BOOMING MAD AND GAVE US A CUSSING AND SAID THEY WOULDN'T LAND US
 I DON'T MIND
 I FIDGETED UP AND DOWN THE RAFT ABUSING MYSELF TO MYSELF AND JIM WAS FIDGETING UP AND DOWN PAST ME
THE CAPTAIN SEE ME STANDING AROUND AND TOLD ME I BETTER HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT BEFORE I WENT ASHORE
I WENT AROUND AND CLUMB OVER THE BACK STILE BY THE ASH-HOPPER AND STARTED FOR THE KITCHEN
 THEN WE GOT OUT THE RAFT AND SLIPPED ALONG DOWN IN THE SHADE PAST THE FOOT OF THE ISLAND DEAD STILLNEVER SAYING A WORD
YOU DEAR GOOD SOULS!HOW LOVELY_!HOW COULD YOU WELL THEN PRETTY SOON ALL HANDS GOT TO TALKING ABOUT THE DISEASED AGAIN AND HOW GOOD HE WAS AND WHAT A LOSS HE WAS AND ALL THAT
 AND SO HE WARMED UP AND WENT WARBLING AND WARBLING RIGHT ALONG TILL HE WAS ACTULY BEGINNING TO BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS SAYING HIMSELF
 THE MEN WAS VERY HUFFY AND SOME OF THEM WANTED TO HANG JIM FOR AN EXAMPLE TO ALL THE OTHER NIGGERS AROUND THERE SO THEY WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO RUN AWAY LIKE JIM DONE AND MAKING SUCH A RAFT OF TROUBLE AND KEEPING A WHOLE FAMILY SCARED MOST TO DEATH FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS
 SO I NEVER SAID NOTHING
AND ONE OF US OUGHT TO WAIT ON HIM AT DINNER AND DO ANY LITTLE THING FOR HIM HE WANTED DONE
CHAPTER XXIII
CHAPTER XXIII
 YOU'D SEE A MUDDY SOW AND A LITTER OF PIGS COME LAZYING ALONG THE STREET AND WHOLLOP HERSELF RIGHT DOWN IN THE WAY WHERE FOLKS HAD TO WALK AROUND HER AND SHE'D STRETCH OUT AND SHUT HER EYES AND WAVE HER EARS WHILST THE PIGS WAS MILKING HER AND LOOK AS HAPPY AS IF SHE WAS ON SALARY
 HOW COULD A BODY DO IT IN DE NIGHT
 LE'S GO UP STAIRS AND COUNT THIS MONEY AND THEN TAKE AND GIVE IT TO THE GIRLS GOOD LAND DUKE LEMME HUG YOU
 EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT THE MURDER BUT THE CAPTAIN BROKE IN AND SAYS
 SO WE CAN'T RESK BEING AS LONG DIGGING HIM OUT AS WE OUGHT TO
BUT IT WARN'T SURPRISING
 SO DID YOUR SISTER'S CAT'S GRANDMOTHER
 I UZ MOS TO DE FOOT ER DE ISLAN B'FO I FOUND A GOOD PLACE
 I LAID HIM OUT IN A SECOND WITH A STICK AND JIM GRABBED PAP'S WHISKY-JUG AND BEGUN TO POUR IT DOWN
SO THEY ALL MADE FUN OF HIM AND CALLED HIM CRY-BABY AND THAT MADE HIM MAD AND HE SAID HE WOULD GO STRAIGHT AND TELL ALL THE SECRETS
AND HOW THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND WHAT THEY TOLD YOU TO TELL ME
 EN MINE YOU DE REAL PINT IS DOWN FURDERIT'S DOWN DEEPER
 I WAS GOING TO CATCH SOME OF THEM BUT JIM WOULDN'T LET ME
AND AT LAST HE NUDGED US AND WE SLID OUT AND STOOPED DOWN NOT BREATHING AND NOT MAKING THE LEAST NOISE AND SLIPPED STEALTHY TOWARDS THE FENCE IN INJUN FILE AND GOT TO IT ALL RIGHT AND ME AND JIM OVER IT
 THEN TOM MARKED OUT THEM THINGS ON IT WITH THE NAIL AND SET JIM TO WORK ON THEM WITH THE NAIL FOR A CHISEL AND AN IRON BOLT FROM THE RUBBAGE IN THE LEAN-TO FOR A HAMMER AND TOLD HIM TO WORK TILL THE REST OF HIS CANDLE QUIT ON HIM AND THEN HE COULD GO TO BED AND HIDE THE GRINDSTONE UNDER HIS STRAW TICK AND SLEEP ON IT
AND AS FOR ME I DON'T CARE SHUCKS FOR THE MORALITY OF IT NOHOW
 THAT'S THE CORRECT IDEA THEN HE WROTE SOMETHING ON A PAPER AND READ IT OVER AND SAYS
SO THINKS I I'LL GO AND SEARCH THEM ROOMS
HE WENT FOR JUDGE THATCHER.HUCK DECIDED TO LEAVE.POLITICAL ECONOMY.THRASHING AROUND
AND EVERY TIME HE GOT DRUNK HE RAISED CAIN AROUND TOWN
 BUT THAT'S ALWAYS THE WAY
 WHAT DOES HE WANT WITH A PEW WANTS IT TO SET IN
WELL I COULDN'T HAVE IT THAT WAY
SO JIM AND ME SET TO MAJESTYING HIM AND DOING THIS AND THAT AND T'OTHER FOR HIM AND STANDING UP TILL HE TOLD US WE MIGHT SET DOWN
THEN HE LINED OUT TWO MORE FOR THEM TO SINGAND SO ON
 THEN THEY ALL AGREED THAT JIM HAD ACTED VERY WELL AND WAS DESERVING TO HAVE SOME NOTICE TOOK OF IT AND REWARD
 I'D A SHOT HIM
 WAKE UP BY AND BY AND LOOK TO SEE WHAT DONE IT AND MAYBE SEE A STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG UP-STREAM SO FAR OFF TOWARDS THE OTHER SIDE YOU COULDN'T TELL NOTHING ABOUT HER ONLY WHETHER SHE WAS A STERN-WHEEL OR SIDE-WHEEL
IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE A BODY ASHAMED OF THE HUMAN RACE
YOU CAN'T BE SEEN NOW
 OUT WITH THEIR NAMES OR THER'LL BE AN IDIOT SHORT HE GOT UP AND LOOKED DISTRESSED AND FUMBLED HIS HAT AND SAYS
 YOU BROUGHT PART OF A MANBUCK HARKNESS THEREAND IF YOU HADN'T HAD HIM TO START YOU YOU'D A TAKEN IT OUT IN BLOWING
 SO YOU HAD IT IN YOUR POCKET ALL THE TIME
CHAPTER XXV
CHAPTER XXV
HERECOME IN HERE AND IN HE COME AND BILL AFTER HIM
JIM WAS LAID UP FOR FOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS
IT WAS AS BRIGHT AS GLORY AND YOU'D HAVE A LITTLE GLIMPSE OF TREE-TOPS A-PLUNGING ABOUT AWAY OFF YONDER IN THE STORM HUNDREDS OF YARDS FURTHER THAN YOU COULD SEE BEFORE
SOMETHING WAS A-BREWING SURE
 IT WAS RIGHT DOWN AWKWARD AND NOBODY DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO
 I WISH MY MOTHER COULD GET IT
 I JUMPED INTO THE CANOE AND RUN BACK TO THE STERN AND GRABBED THE PADDLE AND SET HER BACK A STROKE
 BOB'S BEEN CARVED UP SOME WITH A BOWIE AND TOM'S BEEN HURT ONCE OR TWICE HAS ANYBODY BEEN KILLED THIS YEAR BUCK YES
I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING BETTERI'LL GIVE YOU A COWHIDE HE SET THERE A-MUMBLING AND A-GROWLING A MINUTE AND THEN HE SAYS
WOULD A RUNAWAY NIGGER RUN SOUTH NO THEY ALLOWED HE WOULDN'T
 THERE WARN'T NO FRIVOLISHNESS ABOUT HIM NOT A BIT AND HE WARN'T EVER LOUD
 OLE MISSUSDAT'S MISS WATSONSHE PECKS ON ME ALL DE TIME EN TREATS ME POOTY ROUGH BUT SHE AWLUZ SAID SHE WOULDN SELL ME DOWN TO ORLEANS
I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE BEEN HERE ALL THE TIME JIM DIDN'T SAY NOTHING FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES BUT SET THERE STUDYING OVER IT
 LOTS OF THE PRINCIPAL PEOPLE GETHERED AROUND THE KING TO LET HIM SEE THEY WAS ON HIS SIDE
 WHY JEST THINKTHERE'S THOUS'N'S AND THOUS'N'S THAT AIN'T NIGH SO WELL OFF
YOU MUST BE SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS OLD AT THE VERY LEAST TROUBLE HAS DONE IT BILGEWATER TROUBLE HAS DONE IT
 THERE WARN'T ANYTHING TO SAY
 WE JUST SET THERE AND WATCHED HIM RIP AND TEAR AROUND TILL HE DROWNDED
I CREPT TO THEIR DOORS AND LISTENED
NEVER GO TO THE CIRCUS NOR THEATER NOR NIGGER SHOWS NOR NOWHERES NOR CHURCH NOR CHURCH BUT YOU ALWAYS WENT TO CHURCH WELL I WAS GONE UP AGAIN
 YOU COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT THE PREACHER SAID ANY MORE ON ACCOUNT OF THE SHOUTING AND CRYING
 I RECKON HE THOUGHT HE'D KEEP THE THING UP TILL HE TIRED THEM PEOPLE OUT SO THEY'D THIN OUT AND HIM AND THE DUKE COULD BREAK LOOSE AND GET AWAY
 S'POSE HE CONTRACTED TO DO A THING AND YOU PAID HIM AND DIDN'T SET DOWN THERE AND SEE THAT HE DONE ITWHAT DID HE DO
BUT THE LAWYER AND THE DOCTOR SUNG OUT
THIS MISERABLENESS WENT ON AS MUCH AS SIX OR SEVEN MINUTES
 TOM SAID HE SLIPPED JIM'S HAT OFF OF HIS HEAD AND HUNG IT ON A LIMB RIGHT OVER HIM AND JIM STIRRED A LITTLE BUT HE DIDN'T WAKE
NONE OF IT AT ALL NONE OF IT AT ALL
THEN WE CRAWLED OUT THROUGH THE HOLE AND SO HOME TO BED WITH HANDS THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY'D BEEN CHAWED
 A BODY CAN'T HARDLY BELIEVE IT BUT HE DIDN'T
 ALL THE MEN JUMPED OFF OF THEIR HORSES AND GRABBED THE HURT ONE AND STARTED TO CARRY HIM TO THE STORE
FOR IF THE EXCITED FOOLS HADN'T LET GO ALL HOLTS AND MADE THAT RUSH TO GET A LOOK WE'D A SLEPT IN OUR CRAVATS TO-NIGHTCRAVATS WARRANTED TO WEAR TOOLONGER THAN WE'D NEED EM THEY WAS STILL A MINUTETHINKING
ACCORDING TO MY PLAN I WAS GOING TO TURN UP THERE FROM THE VILLAGE NOT FROM BELOW
 BUT AT LAST JUST AS I WAS SAILING BY FLASH COMES THE LIGHT IN MARY JANE'S WINDOW
AND BEFORE I COULD BUDGE IT WAS ALL SHRIVELED UP
WHEN YOU GOT TO THE TABLE YOU COULDN'T GO RIGHT TO EATING BUT YOU HAD TO WAIT FOR THE WIDOW TO TUCK DOWN HER HEAD AND GRUMBLE A LITTLE OVER THE VICTUALS THOUGH THERE WARN'T REALLY ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH THEM,THAT IS NOTHING ONLY EVERYTHING WAS COOKED BY ITSELF
 WHY DIDN'T YOU STIR ME UP GOODNESS GRACIOUS IS DAT YOU HUCK
 WITHOUT HELP MIND YOU'THOUT HELP
NEXT MORNING I HEARD TOM WAS A GOOD DEAL BETTER AND THEY SAID AUNT SALLY WAS GONE TO GET A NAP
CHAPTER III
CHAPTER III
AND I FELT DREADFUL GLAD I'D WORKED IT ALL OFF ON TO THE NIGGERS AND YET HADN'T DONE THE NIGGERS NO HARM BY IT
DON'T YOU RECKON I KNOW WHO HID THAT MONEY IN THAT COFFIN YES SIR
 WHICH WAS SOUND ENOUGH JUDGMENT
IS HE CHANGED SO
CHAPTER XXXVI
CHAPTER XXXVI
 BUT HE SIGHED AND PRETTY SOON HE STOPPED DIGGING AND THEN FOR A GOOD LITTLE WHILE I KNOWED THAT HE WAS THINKING
 HE GOT SO WORKED UP AND GOT TO RUNNING ON SO ABOUT HIS TROUBLES HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE'D BEEN A-GOING TO DO
 LET THEM FIND IT OUT FOR THEMSELVESIT'S THEIR LOOKOUT YES I KNOW
 IT JUST KEEPS A BODY ON THE JUMP TO KEEP YOU IN SHIRTS
AND HE SAID THERE WARN'T NO USE IN IT AND I MUST COME ALONG AND LET AUNT SALLY SEE WE WAS ALL RIGHT
 THAT'S A FRENCHMAN'S WAY OF SAYING IT WELL IT'S A BLAME RIDICKLOUS WAY EN I DOAN WANT TO HEAR NO MO BOUT IT
 WHER DOES HE LIVE OH HE LIVES IN ENGLANDSHEFFIELDPREACHES THEREHASN'T EVER BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY
AND I CONTRIVED THE OTHER THINGS JUST TO MAKE CERTAIN
 SO IT WAS ALL UP WITH CAIRO
ON THE SCUTCHEON WE'LL HAVE A BEND OR IN THE DEXTER BASE A SALTIRE MURREY IN THE FESS WITH A DOG COUCHANT FOR COMMON CHARGE AND UNDER HIS FOOT A CHAIN EMBATTLED FOR SLAVERY WITH A CHEVRON VERT IN A CHIEF ENGRAILED AND THREE INVECTED LINES ON A FIELD AZURE WITH THE NOMBRIL POINTS RAMPANT ON A DANCETTE INDENTED
 IN MY OPINION THERE'S A FORTUNE IN EM
AND BEDCLOTHES
 I DON'T SEE NOTHING IN THE WAY OF IT
 I HAIN'T SEE NO TOW-HEAD YOU HAIN'T SEEN NO TOWHEAD
 AND THEN WALTZED IN AND CUSSED HIMSELF AWHILE AND SAID IT ALL COME OF HIM NOT LAYING LATE AND TAKING HIS NATURAL REST THAT MORNING AND HE'D BE BLAMED IF HE'D EVER DO IT AGAIN
 WHAT'S THAT I DON'T KNOW
WARNINGS TO THE PEOPLE THAT SOMETHING IS UP
AND THEY'VE TOOK MY NIGGER WHICH IS THE ONLY NIGGER I'VE GOT IN THE WORLD AND NOW I'M IN A STRANGE COUNTRY AND AIN'T GOT NO PROPERTY NO MORE NOR NOTHING AND NO WAY TO MAKE MY LIVING SO I SET DOWN AND CRIED
BUT I'LL WRITE IT FOR YOU ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND YOU CAN READ IT ALONG THE ROAD TO MR LOTHROP'S IF YOU WANT TO
 WE LET ON IT TOOK NINE MONTHS TO MAKE IT
MISS WATSON SHE KEPT PECKING AT ME AND IT GOT TIRESOME AND LONESOME
SO MARY JANE TOOK US UP AND SHE SHOWED THEM THEIR ROOMS WHICH WAS PLAIN BUT NICE
SO I MADE JIM LAY DOWN IN THE CANOE AND COVER UP WITH THE QUILT BECAUSE IF HE SET UP PEOPLE COULD TELL HE WAS A NIGGER A GOOD WAYS OFF
 I WENT OUT IN THE WOODS AND TURNED IT OVER IN MY MIND A LONG TIME BUT I COULDN'T SEE NO ADVANTAGE ABOUT ITEXCEPT FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE
NEXT NIGHT WE STUCK A PICTURE WHICH TOM DRAWED IN BLOOD OF A SKULL AND CROSSBONES ON THE FRONT DOOR
SO I NEVER TRIED TO DO ANYTHING BUT JUST POKED ALONG LOW-SPIRITED AND ON THE WATCH-OUT
 AND WHEN IT WAS LATE IN THE DAY THE PEOPLE ALL WENT AND THEN I COME IN AND TOLD HER THE NOISE AND SHOOTING WAKED UP ME AND SID AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED AND WE WANTED TO SEE THE FUN SO WE WENT DOWN THE LIGHTNING-ROD AND BOTH OF US GOT HURT A LITTLE AND WE DIDN'T NEVER WANT TO TRY THAT NO MORE
AND THE FIRST CABIN-LIGHT THAT SHOWED I ROUSTED HIM OUT AND WE SLID THE RAFT INTO HIDING QUARTERS FOR THE DAY
OR GO HAWKINGJUST HAWKING AND SPSH!D YOU HEAR A NOISE WE SKIPPED OUT AND LOOKED
GIVE HIM AIR GIVE HIM AIR COLONEL SHERBURN HE TOSSED HIS PISTOL ON TO THE GROUND AND TURNED AROUND ON HIS HEELS AND WALKED OFF
 HE SAID HE KNOWED MOST EVERYTHING
AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE THIS HUSKY UP AND SAYS
THEN HE GIVE THE BOOK TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM TO GET HIS PART BY HEART
 IF WE WAS PRISONERS IT WOULD BECAUSE THEN WE'D HAVE AS MANY YEARS AS WE WANTED AND NO HURRY
 HE KEPT A-LOOKING ME ALL OVER
LETTING ON AIN'T NO TROUBLE
 EVERYBODY GOES AWAY WHEN I WANT THEM TO HELP ME TOW THE RAFT ASHORE AND I CAN'T DO IT BY MYSELF WELL THAT'S INFERNAL MEAN
 THEY GOT HALF WAY TO THE TREE I WAS IN BEFORE THE MEN NOTICED
HUCK FINN DID YOU EVER HEAR OF A PRISONER HAVING PICKS AND SHOVELS AND ALL THE MODERN CONVENIENCES IN HIS WARDROBE TO DIG HIMSELF OUT WITH
 "BLEST IF THE OLD NONESUCH AIN'T A HEPPIN US OUT AGIN AND HE BEGUN TO HAUL OUT YALLER-JACKETS AND STACK THEM UP
AND ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK IT COME ON TO RAIN AND BLOW AND THUNDER AND LIGHTEN LIKE EVERYTHING
 A BODY WOULD A THOUGHT HE WAS ADAMHE WAS JUST ALL MUD
HE FOUND FAULT WITH EVERY LITTLE THING
 I DON'T DENY IT I WAS MOST PUTRIFIED WITH ASTONISHMENT WHEN YOU GIVE ME THAT SMACK WE HAD DINNER OUT IN THAT BROAD OPEN PASSAGE BETWIXT THE HOUSE AND THE KITCHEN
 I TOLD HIM I WARN'T AFRAID OF HIM TELLING THE PEOPLE WHERE I WAS
THESE COUNTRY JAKES WON'T EVER THINK OF THAT
 NOW I'LL REST MY WORKS A LITTLE AND YOU START UP YOURN
 HE WAS UP AT THE PINT THAT MORNIN  I LIVE UP THERE DON'T I
THE CAVE.THE FLOATING HOUSE
WHY THIS IS WONDERFUL
 JIM SAID IT WOULD TAKE HIM A YEAR TO SCRABBLE SUCH A LOT OF TRUCK ON TO THE LOGS WITH A NAIL AND HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE LETTERS BESIDES
SO HE DOZED OFF PRETTY SOON
EF I COULD GIT DE TEN CENTS BACK I'D CALL IT SQUAH EN BE GLAD ER DE CHANST WELL IT'S ALL RIGHT ANYWAY JIM LONG AS YOU'RE GOING TO BE RICH AGAIN SOME TIME OR OTHER YES
 "_YOU TALK LIKE AN ENGLISHMAN DON'T YOU
WE WENT DRIFTING DOWN INTO A BIG BEND AND THE NIGHT CLOUDED UP AND GOT HOT
S'POSE HE OPENED HIS MOUTHWHAT THEN
 DEY'S TWO ANGELS HOVERIN ROUN BOUT HIM
 AIN'T I RIGHT YES I RECK'N YOU ARE
 I KNOW HIM PERFECTLY EASY IT WAS ME HE POINTED AT
 HUMAN BEINGS CAN BE AWFUL CRUEL TO ONE ANOTHER
 THEY HAD WHITE DOMESTIC AWNINGS IN FRONT AND THE COUNTRY PEOPLE HITCHED THEIR HORSES TO THE AWNING-POSTS
AND I COULDN'T EVER UNDERSTAND BEFORE UNTIL THAT MINUTE AND THAT TALK HOW HE COULD HELP A BODY SET A NIGGER FREE WITH HIS BRINGING-UP
 WE WENT THROUGH THE YARD SO AS TO SEE WHAT THE HOUNDS WOULD DO
BUT I COULDN'T KEEP FROM STUDYING OVER IT AND WISHING I KNOWED WHO SHOT THE MAN AND WHAT THEY DONE IT FOR
 THEN WE HUNG UP OUR SIGNAL LANTERN AND JUDGED THAT WE WAS FREE AND SAFE ONCE MORE
AIN'T IT THERE IN HIS BED FOR A CLEW AFTER HE'S GONE
 WE ARE RIGHT DOWN SORRY FOR YOU BUT WEWELL HANG IT WE DON'T WANT THE SMALL-POX YOU SEE
 A MONTH AND A HALF THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR_AND HE COME OUT IN CHINA
 BUT THE KING HE ONLY LOOKED SORROWFUL AND SAYS
BUT THEY WAS OUR DOGS
 WE'LL TAKE THESE FELLOWS TO THE TAVERN AND AFFRONT THEM WITH T'OTHER COUPLE AND I RECKON WE'LL FIND OUT SOMETHING BEFORE WE GET THROUGH IT WAS NUTS FOR THE CROWD THOUGH MAYBE NOT FOR THE KING'S FRIENDS
SO THE FIRST PRANCE THEY MADE THE GENERAL PUBLIC JUMPED IN AND PRANCED THEM OUT OF TOWN
I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO
THERE'S ALWAYS COBS AROUND ABOUT IN A SHUCK TICK AND THEY POKE INTO YOU AND HURT
 THERE'S TWO HUNDERD DOLLARS REWARD ON HIM
 WE CAN GET YOU SOME GARTER-SNAKES AND YOU CAN TIE SOME BUTTONS ON THEIR TAILS AND LET ON THEY'RE RATTLESNAKES AND I RECKON THAT LL HAVE TO DO I K'N STAN DEM MARS TOM BUT BLAME F I COULDN GET ALONG WIDOUT UM I TELL YOU DAT
I MEAN HE GOES TO OUR CHURCH REGULAR WHEN HE'S IN SHEFFIELD
 I TOOK IT UP AND HELD IT IN MY HAND
 JIM HE ALLOWED THEY WAS MADE BUT I ALLOWED THEY HAPPENED
 I SAYS TO MYSELF THEY'LL FOLLOW THE TRACK OF THAT SACKFUL OF ROCKS TO THE SHORE AND THEN DRAG THE RIVER FOR ME
 TAKE MY TRUNK IN YOUR WAGON AND LET ON IT'S YOUR'N
 WE DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF IT
 WE STARTED THROUGH THE WOODS ON A RUN
 ANOTHER WAS FRIENDSHIP'S OFFERING FULL OF BEAUTIFUL STUFF AND POETRY
 I FETCHED OUT THE GUN AND NOW I WAS DONE
 WHY YONDER HE IS NOW
 I WAS MOST POWERFUL SICK AND SLUNK TO A CHAIR AND SET DOWN
 "BUT MAYBE HIS CHANCE AIN'T WORTH NO MORE THAN THAT IF HE'LL SELL IT SO CHEAP
DOES WHO KNOW US WHY DIS-YER RUNAWAY NIGGER I DON'T RECKON HE DOES
EACH PERSON HAD THEIR OWN NIGGER TO WAIT ON THEMBUCK TOO
THERE'S WHERE THE DIFFERENCE WAS
HERE GIMME THE CHAW AND YOU TAKE THE PLUG ALL THE STREETS AND LANES WAS JUST MUD
 THEN I SEE ANOTHER SPECK AND CHASED THAT
 THERE WARN'T A SOUND THERE
 I WAS GETTING SORT OF USED TO THE WIDOW'S WAYS TOO AND THEY WARN'T SO RASPY ON ME
THE OTHER FELLOW WAS ABOUT THIRTY AND DRESSED ABOUT AS ORNERY
 THERE AIN'T NO HARM IN A HOUND NOHOW
AND YOU NEEDN'T LET ON TO KNOW ME AT FIRST I SAYS
AND SO THEY'D LAY FOR HIM AND MAKE IT MIGHTY WARM FOR HIM
 WHY YOU TALK LIKE A MUGGINS WELL ANYWAY MAYBE YOU'D BETTER TELL SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS LISTEN AT THAT NOW
AND IF A PICK'S THE HANDIEST THING THAT'S THE THING I'M A-GOING TO DIG THAT NIGGER OR THAT WATERMELON OR THAT SUNDAY-SCHOOL BOOK OUT WITH
SHAKSPEREAN REVIVAL
YOU DO AS MR PARKER TOLD YOU AND YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT THAT'S SO MY BOYGOOD-BYE GOOD-BYE
 BLESS YOU CHILD I WOULDN'T TELL ON YOU
BY AND BY HE GOT IT
SO I WAS A GOOD LONG TIME IN GETTING OVER
TOM WAS JOYFUL
AND DEACON LOT HOVEY AND BEN RUCKER AND ABNER SHACKLEFORD AND LEVI BELL THE LAWYER
 MY LAND
 HE HOPPED AROUND THE CABIN CONSIDERABLE FIRST ON ONE LEG AND THEN ON THE OTHER HOLDING FIRST ONE SHIN AND THEN THE OTHER ONE AND AT LAST HE LET OUT WITH HIS LEFT FOOT ALL OF A SUDDEN AND FETCHED THE TUB A RATTLING KICK
 I RUN THE CANOE INTO A DEEP DENT IN THE BANK THAT I KNOWED ABOUT
OH THERE'S ONE THING I FORGOT
WELL IT SOUNDS VERY GOOD DOCTOR I'M OBLEEGED TO SAY THEN THE OTHERS SOFTENED UP A LITTLE TOO AND I WAS MIGHTY THANKFUL TO THAT OLD DOCTOR FOR DOING JIM THAT GOOD TURN
 I AM ALONE IN THE WORLDLET ME SUFFER
 I WON'T SAY I WARN'T GOIN TO DO IT BECAUSE I WAS
 JIM WAS GONE
HIS SPIRIT WAS GONE FOR TO SPORT ALOFT    IN THE REALMS OF THE GOOD AND GREAT
 PROVIDENCE HAD STOOD BY ME THIS FUR ALL RIGHT BUT I WAS HARD AND TIGHT AGROUND NOW
DOAN HURT MEDON'T
 THEY GET ALL THEIR CHAWING BY BORROWING
THEY CAN HAVE JUST AS MUCH AS THEY WANT
 I CROPE OUT ALL A-TREMBLIN EN CROPE AROUN EN OPEN DE DO EASY EN SLOW EN POKE MY HEAD IN BEHINE DE CHILE SOF EN STILL EN ALL UV A SUDDEN I SAYS POW
 CONFOUND IT I JUST EXPECT THE WIND HAS BLOWED IT TO US
AND THE WAY THEY LAID ON AND PRANCED AROUND THE RAFT WAS GRAND TO SEE
 COME SLOW
AND WHEN I COME TO HIM AGAIN IN THE SWAMP UP THERE WHERE THE FEUD WAS
 I'M ON THE WAW-PATH AND THE PRICE UV COFFINS IS A-GWYNE TO RAISE HE WAS DRUNK AND WEAVING ABOUT IN HIS SADDLE
HE MOVED PEOPLE AROUND HE SQUEEZED IN LATE ONES HE OPENED UP PASSAGEWAYS AND DONE IT WITH NODS AND SIGNS WITH HIS HANDS
BUT I SAID NOBODY WOULDN'T EVER SEE THE PLATES THAT JIM THROWED OUT BECAUSE THEY'D FALL IN THE DOG-FENNEL AND JIMPSON WEEDS UNDER THE WINDOW-HOLETHEN WE COULD TOTE THEM BACK AND HE COULD USE THEM OVER AGAIN
I WAS A-LISTENIN TO ALL DE TALK EN I SLIPS INTO DE RIVER EN WAS GWYNE TO SHOVE FOR SHO IF DEY COME ABOARD
THE OLD MAN GRABBED ME BY THE HAND AND SHOOK AND KEPT ON SHAKING
GOOD_-BYE
 SAY DO WE KILL THE WOMEN TOO WELL BEN ROGERS IF I WAS AS IGNORANT AS YOU I WOULDN'T LET ON
I'VE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING
 IT KIND OF MADE HIM DRUNK AS YOU MAY SAY AND HE DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING AT ALL THE REST OF THE DAY AND PREACHED A PRAYER-MEETING SERMON THAT NIGHT THAT GAVE HIM A RATTLING RUPUTATION BECAUSE THE OLDEST MAN IN THE WORLD COULDN'T A UNDERSTOOD IT
 YOU LISTEN TO ME
YOU CAN'T MEAN IT YES
 WELL NEXT DAY THEY FOUND OUT THE NIGGER WAS GONE
AND I SEE JIM BEFORE ME ALL THE TIME
 I PULLED ALL AROUND HER AND HOLLERED A LITTLE BUT THERE WASN'T ANY ANSWER
HOW LONG WAS HE AT IT YOU RECKON I DON'T KNOW WELL GUESS I DON'T KNOW
WE COULD A TOUCHED HIM NEARLY
 NEXT YOU'D SEE A RAFT SLIDING BY AWAY OFF YONDER AND MAYBE A GALOOT ON IT CHOPPING BECAUSE THEY'RE MOST ALWAYS DOING IT ON A RAFT
THEN SHE LOOKED IN THE TESTAMENT TILL SHE FOUND THE PAPER AND AS SOON AS SHE READ IT SHE LOOKED GLAD
AND IF YOU DON'T LOOK CLOST YOU CAN'T SEE IT
 WHY IT WAS ASTONISHING THE WAY I FELT AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER RIGHT STRAIGHT OFF AND MY TROUBLES ALL GONE
 I HAIN'T HEARN BOUT NONE UN UM SKASELY BUT OLE KING SOLLERMUN ONLESS YOU COUNTS DEM KINGS DAT'S IN A PACK ER K'YARDS
 NOBODY ELSE WOULD COME A-HUNTING AFTER ME
 SO THEY SAID I COULD HAVE A HOME THERE AS LONG AS I WANTED IT
 THERE AIN'T NO WATCHMAN TO BE DRUGGEDNOW THERE OUGHT TO BE A WATCHMAN
 I WAS SCARED BUT A MAN SAYS
BUT IT LOOKS SO TO ME ANYWAY
WE DIDN'T SHOW OURSELVES IN DAYLIGHT
AND AT LAST UNCLE SILAS LOOKING KIND OF FOOLISH FISHES UP THAT SPOON OUT OF HIS POCKET
 I LAY YOU'LL BE THE METHUSALEM-NUMSKULL OF CREATION BEFORE EVER I ASK YOUOR THE LIKES OF YOU WELL HE SAYS IT DOES SURPRISE ME SO
 YOU'VE HAD TO KEEP IN THE WOODS ALL THE TIME OF COURSE
 BUT YOU GOT TO BE MIGHTY CAREFUL
 IS THERE ANYBODY HERE THAT HELPED TO LAY OUT MY BRHELPED TO LAY OUT THE LATE PETER WILKS FOR BURYING YES SAYS SOMEBODY ME AND AB TURNER DONE IT
 THERE WARN'T A SOUND ANYWHERES
 THER AIN'T NO WAY BUT JUST TO NOT TELL ANYBODY AT ALL WELL MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHTYES I JUDGE YOU ARE RIGHT BUT I RECKON WE OUGHT TO TELL UNCLE HARVEY SHE'S GONE OUT A WHILE ANYWAY SO HE WON'T BE UNEASY ABOUT HER YES MISS MARY JANE SHE WANTED YOU TO DO THAT
