SHE TOSSED HER HEAD INDIGNANTLY THEN STRUCK OUT BRAVELY ON THE SOFT GROUND SLIPPING BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AS SHE CLIMBED THE HILL TO THE MAIN ROAD
THAT'S ALL I HATE ABOUT IT ALEXANDRA HE SAID SLOWLY
GOT BUSINESS THERE HE ASKED
WHERE SHOULD SHE GO
THAT'S WHAT I'VE WORKED FOR
ALEXANDRA TOOK THE PATH THAT LED TO THE ORCHARD
OSCAR AND LOU ON THE FRONT SEAT WORE THEIR CLOTH HATS AND COATS NEVER WORN EXCEPT ON SUNDAYS AND EMIL ON THE SECOND SEAT WITH ALEXANDRA SAT PROUDLY IN HIS NEW TROUSERS MADE FROM A PAIR OF HIS FATHER'S AND A PINK-STRIPED SHIRT WITH A WIDE RUFFLED COLLAR
TO THE ASYLUM ALEXANDRA PUT DOWN HER SEWING-BASKET
SHE SAT DOWN AND LOOKED AT HIM FOR A LONG WHILE VERY THOUGHTFULLY
WE HAVE A BIG BUNCH OF HOGS IVAR
WHY LOU I CAN REMEMBER WHEN YOU AND OSCAR WANTED TO SELL THIS HOMESTEAD AND ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS TO OLD PREACHER ERICSON FOR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS
UNLESS ITS STRINGS CAN SCREAM TO THE TOUCH OF PAIN
FATHER DUCHESNE THE BISHOP AND THE VISITING PRIESTS DINED WITH FABIEN SAUVAGE THE BANKER
AND WILL YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO TELL THE IRISHMAN THAT HE IS NOT TO WORK THE BROWN GELDING UNTIL THE SORE ON ITS SHOULDER IS HEALED THAT I WILL
HER WHITE DRESS LOOKED GRAY IN THE DARKNESS
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING BEFORE CARL COMES ALEXANDRA ROSE QUICKLY AND CAME TO THE DOOR
SIN AND DEATH FOR THE YOUNG ONES
GET THEM OFF THE OLD STINKING GROUND AND DO NOT LET THEM GO BACK THERE UNTIL WINTER
SHE HAD REASONS FOR NOT WISHING HER HUSBAND TO CROSS ALEXANDRA TOO OPENLY
MARIE I AM GOING TO SEND FOR AN OLD WOMAN NEXT
HE COUNTED THE CATTLE OVER AND OVER
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE THREE DAYS AGO
THEY HAD NOW ONLY THEIR HEARTS TO GIVE EACH OTHER
WERE YOU HUNTING SOMEBODY NO THANK YOU
DO YOU AGREE WITH THEM THAT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO CHANGE MY WAY OF LIVING EMIL LOOKED AT THE OUTLINE OF HIS SISTER'S HEAD IN THE DIM LIGHT
EVERYBODY IRRITATED HER
HE ALWAYS ADDRESSED ALEXANDRA IN TERMS OF THE DEEPEST RESPECT HOPING TO SET A GOOD EXAMPLE TO THE KITCHEN GIRLS WHOM HE THOUGHT TOO FAMILIAR IN THEIR MANNERS
ALEXANDRA MADE EMIL TELL MRS XAVIER CHEVALIER THE MOTHER OF THE TWENTY ABOUT HOW HE HAD SEEN A FAMOUS MATADOR KILLED IN THE BULL-RING
BUT NOW WHEN HE STOOD BY THE WINDMILL IN THE BRIGHT SPACE BETWEEN THE BARN AND THE HOUSE FACING HIS OWN BLACK DOORWAY HE DID NOT SEE HIMSELF AT ALL
GOOD-NIGHT ALEXANDRA
HE WROTE ME HE COULD GIVE ME A LITTLE JOB ENOUGH TO PAY MY WAY AND I COULD LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHAT I WANT TO DO
BOYS SHE SAID SERIOUSLY DON'T LET'S GO ON WITH THIS
A HAMMOCK IS A GOOD BED AND IN WINTER I WRAP UP IN THIS SKIN
YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL ME FRANK EVER CARRIED SUCH A THING MARIE BLINKED AT IT WITH ASTONISHMENT AND SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR
I MIGHT HAVE ONE PUT IN THE BARN FOR IVAR IF IT WILL EASE PEOPLE'S MINDS
DIDN'T SHE HAVE ALL SUMMER BEFORE HER TO LOVE EMIL BERGSON IN WITHOUT TAKING SUCH CHANCES
DON'T BE CROSS EMIL
I'LL ALWAYS BACK YOU BUT IT WOULD SEEM A LITTLE BIT RIDICULOUS TO YOU IF I MARRIED CARL EMIL FIDGETED
I THINK I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS COUNTRY AS WELL AS YOU DO YOURSELF CARL TOOK HER HAND IN BOTH HIS OWN AND PRESSED IT TENDERLY
BUT IT'S HARD WORK PULLING OUT OF DEBT
AREN'T THESE THE PATTERNS MARIA MARIA SPRANG UP FROM THE FLOOR
I WILL SEND YOU OFF TO THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART IN ST LOUIS AND THEY WILL TEACH YOU SOME SENSE I GUESS ACCORDINGLY THE VERY NEXT WEEK ALBERT TOVESKY TOOK HIS DAUGHTER PALE AND TEARFUL DOWN THE RIVER TO THE CONVENT
AFTER TWO OR THREE ATTEMPTS HE LIFTED HIMSELF INTO THE SADDLE AND STARTED FOR HANOVER
IT WAS LIKE A HORSE THAT NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO BREAK TO HARNESS THAT RUNS WILD AND KICKS THINGS TO PIECES
IN TIME OF TROUBLE SIGNA HAD COME BACK TO STAY WITH HER MISTRESS FOR SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE MAIDS FROM WHOM ALEXANDRA WOULD ACCEPT MUCH PERSONAL SERVICE
THERE IS NO DIVINE PROHIBITION FOR THEM IN THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
MY WHEAT'S SHORT BUT IT'S GOTTA GRAND FULL BERRIES
TO-DAY BARNEY FLINN THE BIG RED-HEADED IRISHMAN WHO HAD BEEN WITH ALEXANDRA FOR FIVE YEARS AND WHO WAS ACTUALLY HER FOREMAN THOUGH HE HAD NO SUCH TITLE WAS GRUMBLING ABOUT THE NEW SILO SHE HAD PUT UP THAT SPRING
SHE SEEMED TO BE BROODING OVER SOMETHING AND HOLDING SOMETHING BACK
THE FRENCH AND BOHEMIAN BOYS WERE SPIRITED AND JOLLY LIKED VARIETY AND WERE AS MUCH PREDISPOSED TO FAVOR ANYTHING NEW AS THE SCANDINAVIAN BOYS WERE TO REJECT IT
AND THE WORST THING WE CAN DO IS TO MAKE HER SORE AT US
I AM SO TIRED I DIDN'T KNOW HOW I'D EVER GET HOME IVAR SWUNG THE LANTERN UP SO THAT IT SHONE IN HER FACE
I WANTED HER TO MARRY THAT NICE SMIRKA BOY WHO WORKED FOR US LAST WINTER
IT DIDN'T SEEM OUT OF PLACE
FOR EMIL THE CHAPTER HAD BEEN SHORT
YOU HAVE SEEN LOU AND OSCAR ALEXANDRA ASKED
I NO MAN TO FIGHT
HOW LITTLE YOU HAVE CHANGED
I'M GLAD YOU CAME IVAR TURNED THE MARE AND URGED HER INTO A SLIDING TROT
YOU COME TO-MORROW SURE
SHE WAS GLAD TO HAVE EMIL SEE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE OF AN INTELLIGENT CITY-BRED GIRL LIKE THEIR NEIGHBOR
THE WAY HERE IS FOR ALL TO DO ALIKE
OPENING THE PASTURE GATE FROM THE SADDLE EMIL RODE ACROSS THE FIELD TO THE CLEARING WHERE THE THRESHER STOOD DRIVEN BY A STATIONARY ENGINE AND FED FROM THE HEADER BOXES
TO THE EAST THE SOD STABLES THE CATTLE CORRAL THE POND,--AND THEN THE GRASS
THE BOYS LOOKED ANGRY
BUT HE COULD NEVER IN THE WORLD DO THAT
NEITHER OSCAR NOR LOU HAS CHANGED MUCH
THEY LONGED FOR A JERUSALEM TO DELIVER
LET'S SEE
THAT'S JUST WHAT I WANT TO FIND OUT
IT WAS NO FAULT OF THEIRS THAT THEY HAD BEEN DRAGGED INTO THE WILDERNESS WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE BOYS
THERE ARE A FEW FINE FARMS BUT THEY ARE OWNED BY THE RICH MEN IN TOWN AND COULDN'T BE BOUGHT
HE COULD SEE THE EMPTY PATH A LONG WAY IN THE MOONLIGHT
BUT WHERE HER COLLAR FALLS AWAY FROM HER NECK OR WHERE HER SLEEVES ARE PUSHED BACK FROM HER WRIST THE SKIN IS OF SUCH SMOOTHNESS AND WHITENESS AS NONE BUT SWEDISH WOMEN EVER POSSESS
EVERYWHERE THE GRAIN STOOD RIPE AND THE HOT AFTERNOON WAS FULL OF THE SMELL OF THE RIPE WHEAT LIKE THE SMELL OF BREAD BAKING IN AN OVEN
HE'S AT HOME WITH HIS GRANDMA
HERE YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND OF YOUR OWN YOU WOULD BE MISSED
WHEN A GIRL HAD LOVED ONE MAN AND THEN LOVED ANOTHER WHILE THAT MAN WAS STILL ALIVE EVERYBODY KNEW WHAT TO THINK OF HER
THEY ARE THE MEN TO WATCH IN A NEW COUNTRY
WANT TO GO WITH US LOU CALLED
IF THAT LOUIS CAN MEND SHOES HE CAN MEND FENCE MAYBE SAID ALEXANDRA PLACIDLY
SHE AND FRANK SHE TOLD HERSELF WERE LEFT OUT OF THAT GROUP OF FRIENDS WHO HAD BEEN OVERWHELMED BY DISASTER
GOOD ADVICE IS ALL RIGHT BUT IT DON'T GET THE WEEDS OUT OF THE CORN MAYBE NOT BUT IT SOMETIMES PUTS IN THE CROP AND IT SOMETIMES KEEPS THE FIELDS FOR CORN TO GROW IN SAID ALEXANDRA DRYLY
WHEN YOU MARRY AND WANT A HOUSE OF YOUR OWN THE LAND WILL BE DIVIDED FAIRLY ACCORDING TO THE COURTS
THE PLEASANTEST ROOMS IN THE HOUSE ARE THE KITCHEN--WHERE ALEXANDRA'S THREE YOUNG SWEDISH GIRLS CHATTER AND COOK AND PICKLE AND PRESERVE ALL SUMMER LONG--AND THE SITTING-ROOM IN WHICH ALEXANDRA HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER THE OLD HOMELY FURNITURE THAT THE BERGSONS USED IN THEIR FIRST LOG HOUSE THE FAMILY PORTRAITS AND THE FEW THINGS HER MOTHER BROUGHT FROM SWEDEN
A WOMAN MUTILATED AND BLEEDING IN HIS ORCHARD--IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS A WOMAN THAT HE WAS SO AFRAID
LAZY HE MURMURED TURNING ON HIS SIDE AND LOOKING AT HER
EVERYBODY'S ASLEEP
HE IS SO VIOLENT IN HIS FEELINGS LIKE THAT IS HE GOING TO FARM HERE WITH YOU HE SHALL DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO ALEXANDRA DECLARED WARMLY
HE MIGHT WANT IT AND TAKE IT RIGHT OFF YOUR BACK EMIL GRINNED
HOW WAS IT IN THE EARLY DAYS MOTHER MRS BERGSON WAS WEEPING QUIETLY
I GUESS I'LL GO AND ASK HER I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT TIME WHEN WE FIRST CAME HERE AND OUR HORSE HAD THE COLIC AND I RAN OVER TO YOUR PLACE--YOUR FATHER WAS AWAY AND YOU CAME HOME WITH ME AND SHOWED FATHER HOW TO LET THE WIND OUT OF THE HORSE
I CAN'T HELP EMIL NOW SO I'M GOING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR YOU
CARL WANTS TO SEE THE ORCHARD
ALL THE FRENCH GIRLS CLAMORED FOR IT AND THEIR SWEETHEARTS BID AGAINST EACH OTHER RECKLESSLY
MARIE STOP AND TELL ME EMIL OVERTOOK HER AND CATCHING HER BY THE SHOULDERS SHOOK HER GENTLY AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO AWAKEN A SLEEPWALKER
MAYBE IT'LL COME OUT RIGHT
I CAN REMEMBER FATHER WHEN HE WAS QUITE A YOUNG MAN
AS AMEDEE WAS NOT ON THE ENGINE EMIL RODE ON TO THE WHEATFIELD WHERE HE RECOGNIZED ON THE HEADER THE SLIGHT WIRY FIGURE OF HIS FRIEND COATLESS HIS WHITE SHIRT PUFFED OUT BY THE WIND HIS STRAW HAT STUCK JAUNTILY ON THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD
MARIE WAS A STRANGER IN THE COUNTRY HAVING COME FROM OMAHA WITH HER MOTHER TO VISIT HER UNCLE JOE TOVESKY
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING THEY SAT DOWN ON THE GRASS-TUFTED BANK AND CARL TOLD HER HOW HE HAD SEEN EMIL AND MARIE OUT BY THE POND THAT MORNING MORE THAN A YEAR AGO AND HOW YOUNG AND CHARMING AND FULL OF GRACE THEY HAD SEEMED TO HIM
HE LIKED HER CREAMY SKIN AND HAPPY INNOCENT EYES AND HE COULD SEE THAT HER MOTHER'S WAY OF TALKING DISTRESSED HER
THEY WILL NOT COME HERE AGAIN EMIL SCARCELY HEARD WHAT SHE WAS SAYING
I REMEMBER YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE ALWAYS BUYING PENCILS AND TUBES OF PAINT AT THE DRUG STORE
HIS FEEBLE FLIRTATIOUS INSTINCTS HAD BEEN CRUSHED BEFORE BUT NEVER SO MERCILESSLY
I NEVER WOULD-A DONE DAT IF I AIN'T HAD DAT GUN ALONG
EVERYBODY WILL SAY WE ARE CRAZY
HE HAD PAID OFF HIS MORTGAGES AND HAD ENDED PRETTY MUCH WHERE HE BEGAN WITH THE LAND
BUT THIS WINTER I'D LIKE TO SPEND WITH YOU
SHE COULD STILL TAKE SOME COMFORT IN THE WORLD IF SHE HAD BACON IN THE CAVE GLASS JARS ON THE SHELVES AND SHEETS IN THE PRESS
THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO SAY
DIDN'T YOU KNOW EMIL WAS THE ONE WHO TREMBLED THROUGH ALL HIS FRAME
OLD MRS HILLER TOLD ME ONCE AT THE CHURCH SUPPER THAT SHE COULD MAKE SEVEN KINDS OF FANCY BREAD BUT MARIE COULD MAKE A DOZEN MRS LEE HELD UP ONE OF THE APRICOT ROLLS BETWEEN HER BROWN THUMB AND FOREFINGER AND WEIGHED IT CRITICALLY
THE GUESTS AND THE TIRESOME LITTLE NORWEGIAN PREACHER WHO HAD PERFORMED THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY WERE SAYING GOOD-NIGHT
AT LAST SHE SAID SLOWLY AND YET I WOULD RATHER HAVE EMIL GROW UP LIKE THAT THAN LIKE HIS TWO BROTHERS
AFTER HE WAS GONE MARIE WENT OUT TO THE BACK PORCH TO BEGIN HER BUTTER-MAKING
ONLY WHY COULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN RAOUL MARCEL OR JAN SMIRKA
YOU'D SAVE TIME FOR YOURSELF IN THE END FRANK'S NECK STIFFENED
THAT EVENING AFTER SHE HAD WASHED THE SUPPER DISHES ALEXANDRA SAT DOWN ON THE KITCHEN DOORSTEP WHILE HER MOTHER WAS MIXING THE BREAD
THE NEXT SUMMER ONE OF HIS PLOW HORSES BROKE ITS LEG IN A PRAIRIEDOG HOLE AND HAD TO BE SHOT
MARIE TOOK UP HER CHERRIES AND WENT SLOWLY TOWARD THE HOUSE CRYING BITTERLY
I'LL HAVE TO GO UP AFTER HER ALEXANDRA
MARIE WANTED IT TOO AND SHE KEPT MAKING SIGNALS TO FRANK WHICH HE TOOK A SOUR PLEASURE IN DISREGARDING
ARE YOU COMING OUT EMIL ASKED IMPATIENTLY
HAVE YOU GOT IT YES
ALEXANDRA PUSHED HER HAIR BACK FROM HER BROW WITH A PUZZLED THOUGHTFUL GESTURE
WHEN HE HAD BEEN MOWING THE BETTER PART OF AN HOUR HE HEARD THE RATTLE OF A LIGHT CART ON THE ROAD BEHIND HIM
HE WAS A TALL BOY OF FIFTEEN SLIGHT AND NARROW-CHESTED
I DON'T WONDER THAT HER HUSBAND IS JEALOUS
OH CARL
THE HORSEMEN CLOSED ABOUT THE CARRIAGE LIKE A GUARD AND WHENEVER A RESTLESS HORSE BROKE FROM CONTROL AND SHOT DOWN THE ROAD AHEAD OF THE BODY THE BISHOP LAUGHED AND RUBBED HIS PLUMP HANDS TOGETHER
ALEXANDRA HAD PUT HERSELF INTO THE HANDS OF THE HANOVER FURNITURE DEALER AND HE HAD CONSCIENTIOUSLY DONE HIS BEST TO MAKE HER DINING-ROOM LOOK LIKE HIS DISPLAY WINDOW
SUDDENLY SHE TOOK A QUICK STEP FORWARD
SHE'D MARRY HIM OUT OF CONTRARINESS I ONLY MEANT SAID OSCAR THAT SHE IS OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW BETTER AND SHE IS
ALEXANDRA WOULDN'T NEVER LET FRANK SHABATA PLOUGH OVER IT ANNIE LEE WHO EVER SINCE THE VISITOR WAS ANNOUNCED HAD BEEN TOUCHING UP HER HAIR AND SETTLING HER LACE AND WISHING SHE HAD WORN ANOTHER DRESS NOW EMERGED WITH HER THREE DAUGHTERS AND INTRODUCED THEM
SO LONG AS I AM SUITED WITH YOU THERE IS NOTHING TO BE SAID IVAR PULLED A RED HANDKERCHIEF OUT OF THE BREAST OF HIS BLOUSE AND WIPED HIS EYES AND BEARD
BOTH EMIL AND THE COUNTRY HAD BECOME WHAT SHE HAD HOPED
I USED TO FEEL THAT IN HER WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL
HE LIFTED HIS TORMENTED FACE AND LOOKED AT THE SKY
I DON'T NEED MONEY
I CAN'T SEE EXACTLY WHY
THERE WAS A MAN IN THE STREETS SELLING APRICOTS AND WE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BEFORE
I NEVER MEAN TO DO NOT'ING TO DAT BOY
PARTLY BECAUSE SHE SAW THAT HER BLACK CLOTHES MADE CARL UNCOMFORTABLE AND PARTLY BECAUSE SHE FELT OPPRESSED BY THEM HERSELF
DID YOU EVER HEAR HIM HOWL CARL
HE WANTED TO GET INTO HIS OWN BED
REALLY HE ASKED INCREDULOUSLY
THERE ARE WEEKLY LETTERS FROM EMIL
THAT IS MY POND
SHE WAS LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AWAY AT THE POINT WHERE THE UPLAND ROAD DISAPPEARED OVER THE RIM OF THE PRAIRIE
I WISH I HAD A DOLLAR FOR EVERY BUCKET OF WATER I'VE CARRIED FOR THOSE TREES
HER EYES BECAME DREAMY AND FILLED WITH TEARS
EMIL SHE SAID SUDDENLY--HE WAS MOWING QUIETLY ABOUT UNDER THE TREE SO AS NOT TO DISTURB HER--"WHAT RELIGION DID THE SWEDES HAVE AWAY BACK BEFORE THEY WERE CHRISTIANS EMIL PAUSED AND STRAIGHTENED HIS BACK
ON THE SHIPBUILDER'S PART THIS MARRIAGE WAS AN INFATUATION THE DESPAIRING FOLLY OF A POWERFUL MAN WHO CANNOT BEAR TO GROW OLD
V ALEXANDRA AND EMIL SPENT FIVE DAYS DOWN AMONG THE RIVER FARMS DRIVING UP AND DOWN THE VALLEY
HE'S JEALOUS ABOUT EVERYTHING HIS FARM AND HIS HORSES AND HIS PRETTY WIFE
SHE AND FRANK HAD BEEN LIVING THERE FOR FIVE YEARS WHEN CARL LINSTRUM CAME BACK TO PAY HIS LONG DEFERRED VISIT TO ALEXANDRA
SHE RAN TO THE DOOR AND PULLED THE OLD WOMAN INTO THE HOUSE WITH A HUG HELPING HER TO TAKE OFF HER WRAPS WHILE ALEXANDRA BLANKETED THE HORSE OUTSIDE
SHE HAD BEEN IMPATIENT BEFORE BUT NOW SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL ANGRY
HE HAD NOT BECOME A TRIM SELF-SATISFIED CITY MAN
THE SKY AND THE LAND WERE A DARK SMOKE COLOR AND SEEMED TO BE COMING TOGETHER LIKE TWO WAVES
IT WAS ALEXANDRA HERSELF WHO AT LAST OPENED THE DISCUSSION
HE CALLED TO HIS SISTER AND SHE ANSWERED FROM HER BEDROOM BEHIND THE SITTING-ROOM SAYING THAT SHE WAS LYING DOWN
YOU WON'T FEEL THAT WE OUGHT TO WAIT LONGER ON EMIL'S ACCOUNT WILL YOU ALEXANDRA ALEXANDRA SHOOK HER HEAD
SHE WAS LYING ON HER RIGHT SIDE IN AN EASY AND NATURAL POSITION HER CHEEK ON EMIL'S SHOULDER
THE GUARD APPEARED AND WITH A SINKING HEART ALEXANDRA SAW FRANK LED AWAY DOWN THE CORRIDOR
BUT YOU'LL WRITE TO ME CARL
DON'T YOU OH EVER SO MUCH
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU BEHIND
THEY ARE SUCH BEAUTIFUL LITTLE TREES CARL FINGERED THE BLUE-GREEN LEAVES POROUS LIKE BLOTTING-PAPER AND SHAPED LIKE BIRCH LEAVES HUNG ON WAXEN RED STEMS
HE IS A MAN NOW SURE ENOUGH
EVERY ONE NOTICED HER EYES
THE RICH SOIL YIELDS HEAVY HARVESTS
WHEN I'VE CRIED UNTIL I CAN'T CRY ANY MORE THEN--THEN I MUST DO SOMETHING ELSE ARE YOU SORRY FOR ME HE PERSISTED
IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HAD PASSED THE GRAVEYARD THAT EMIL REALIZED WHERE HE WAS GOING
IT COULD BE WORTH THAT AND STILL NOT BE WORTH MUCH
WAIT A MOMENT
HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INSIPID FRUIT,--LONG IVORY-COLORED BERRIES TIPPED WITH FAINT PINK LIKE WHITE CORAL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDED ALL SUMMER THROUGH
IV THE NEXT MORNING ANGELIQUE AMEDEE'S WIFE WAS IN THE KITCHEN BAKING PIES ASSISTED BY OLD MRS CHEVALIER
IT IS NOT HIS WAY TO ABUSE HIS MARE THE OLD MAN KEPT MUTTERING AS HE SCUTTLED THROUGH THE SHORT WET PASTURE GRASS ON HIS BARE FEET
I THOUGHT YOU WERE VERY ROMANTIC BECAUSE YOU COULD DRAW AND HAD SUCH BLACK EYES CARL SMILED
SHE'S TOO YOUNG AND PRETTY FOR THIS SORT OF LIFE
HE PETTED HER JUST LIKE YOU DO YOUR CATS
THE MOMENT I KNEW YOU WERE IN TROUBLE THE MOMENT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED ME IT ALL LOOKED DIFFERENT
IT DON'T SEEM RIGHT THAT WE MUST ALL BE SO MISERABLE
I'VE BEEN UP LOOKING AT ANGELIQUE'S WEDDING CLOTHES MARIE WENT ON AND I'M SO EXCITED I CAN HARDLY WAIT UNTIL SUNDAY
WHO WOULDN'T WITH ALL THOSE SPANISH GIRLS DROPPING FLOWERS DOWN FROM THEIR WINDOWS
THAT WARM FRIENDLY SILENCE FULL OF PERFECT UNDERSTANDING IN WHICH EMIL AND ALEXANDRA HAD SPENT MANY OF THEIR HAPPIEST HALF-HOURS
THEY SAY IT WAS ALL MY FAULT
SHE SAT WITH THE EASE THAT BELONGS TO PERSONS OF AN ESSENTIALLY HAPPY NATURE WHO CAN FIND A COMFORTABLE SPOT ALMOST ANYWHERE
LOU CAN LEARN BY MY MISTAKES AND I CAN LEARN BY HIS
HE WAS GOING DIRECTLY TO OMAHA TO READ LAW IN THE OFFICE OF A SWEDISH LAWYER UNTIL OCTOBER WHEN HE WOULD ENTER THE LAW SCHOOL AT ANN ARBOR
AIN'T HE GOT PLENTY BROTHERS AND SISTERS
IT IS SUPPOSED THAT NELSE JENSEN ONE OF THE SIX MEN AT THE DINNER-TABLE IS COURTING SIGNA THOUGH HE HAS BEEN SO CAREFUL NOT TO COMMIT HIMSELF THAT NO ONE IN THE HOUSE LEAST OF ALL SIGNA CAN TELL JUST HOW FAR THE MATTER HAS PROGRESSED
THEY'LL BE TALKING WILD ANYWAY AND NO GOOD COMES OF KEEPING BAD NEWS
IT WAS LIKE THAT AT THE UNIVERSITY
OSCAR SPOKE UP GRIMLY
HE AND I WOULD ALWAYS GET ON
HER TEACHER SAYS SO ANNIE BROUGHT OUT WITH SPIRIT
AFTER SUPPER SHE WENT OUT FOR A WALK
THEY CAME IN AND STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE BED
IF ONE LISTENED TO THE RAPTUROUS SONG OF THE LARK THE DRUMMING OF THE QUAIL THE BURR OF THE LOCUST AGAINST THAT VAST SILENCE ONE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IVAR MEANT
YOU FELLOWS BACK THERE MUST BE A TAME LOT
IT'S THEN THAT I WANT TO PULL THE CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER
SHE BLUSHED AND LAUGHED EXCITEDLY AS SHE GAVE EMIL HER HAND AND LOOKED DELIGHTEDLY AT THE BLACK VELVET COAT THAT BROUGHT OUT HIS FAIR SKIN AND FINE BLOND HEAD
HE LEANED OVER THE CARD-TABLE AND GAVE HIMSELF UP TO LOOKING AT HER
PLEASE LEAVE THE ROSES TILL LAST IF YOU MUST CUT THEM
WHAT A WASTE CARL REFLECTED
WE HAVE NO TIES WE KNOW NOBODY WE OWN NOTHING
IT SEEMS AS IF I ALWAYS MAKE HIM JUST AS BAD AS HE CAN BE LATER IN THE WINTER ALEXANDRA LOOKED BACK UPON THAT AFTERNOON AS THE LAST SATISFACTORY VISIT SHE HAD HAD WITH MARIE
AND SOUR MILK
DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ME IVAR ALEXANDRA ASKED AS SHE ROSE FROM THE TABLE
I'D BE AWFUL SCARED TO GO HE ADMITTED IF YOU BIG BOYS WEREN'T ALONG TO TAKE CARE OF ME
WHEN WE FIRST CAME HERE FATHER USED TO HAVE DREAMS ABOUT MAKING A GREAT FORTUNE AND GOING BACK TO SWEDEN TO PAY BACK TO THE POOR SAILORS THE MONEY GRANDFATHER HAD LOST EMIL STIRRED ON THE LOUNGE
MERCIFUL GOD HE GROANED
WHEN EMIL CAME BACK FROM THE VILLAGE HE LINGERED OUTSIDE ON THE TERRACE WITH THE BOYS
GOOD-NIGHT ALEXANDRA SHE CALLED BACK IN A STRAINED VOICE RUNNING DOWN THE GRAVEL WALK
GUD
I HAVE TO KEEP TELLING MYSELF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN SHE SAID SOFTLY
THE BOHEMIANS AND GERMANS WERE SO DIFFERENT COME EMIL DON'T GO BACK ON YOUR OWN PEOPLE
WANDERING AROUND THIS WAY OSCAR SPOKE SOLEMNLY AS FROM THE DEPTHS OF A CAVERN
HE IS GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE A WHOLE CHANCE
THAT BIG BOHEMIAN IS IT
AND YET DOWN UNDER THE FROZEN CRUSTS AT THE ROOTS OF THE TREES THE SECRET OF LIFE WAS STILL SAFE WARM AS THE BLOOD IN ONE'S HEART
JOHN BERGSON HAD MARRIED BENEATH HIM BUT HE HAD MARRIED A GOOD HOUSEWIFE
I'M SURE IT WAS TO HAVE SONS LIKE EMIL AND TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE THAT FATHER LEFT THE OLD COUNTRY
NEIGHBORING FIELDS I IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHN BERGSON DIED
THEY HAD BEEN GOOD FRIENDS SINCE THEY WERE CHILDREN
YOU GOTTA ROCK IN THERE THUMPING EMIL ON THE RIBS
AND NOW I PAY FOR IT YOU DON'T DO ALL THE PAYING THAT'S IT
HE BEGAN TO ACT JUST AS A MAN WHO FALLS INTO THE FIRE BEGINS TO ACT
OH I DON'T MEAN ALL OF THEM I MEAN THAT LOW PLACE DOWN BY MY TREE WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY
ALEXANDRA SAID EMIL SUDDENLY DO YOU REMEMBER THE WILD DUCK WE SAW DOWN ON THE RIVER THAT TIME HIS SISTER LOOKED UP
IT'S A GOOD COLOR DON'T YOU THINK
WHY ALEXANDRA YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WHEN CARL TURNED AWAY HE SAID I'LL SEE TO YOUR TEAM ALEXANDRA WENT INTO THE STORE TO HAVE HER PURCHASES PACKED IN THE EGG-BOXES AND TO GET WARM BEFORE SHE SET OUT ON HER LONG COLD DRIVE
EVEN HIS CLOTHES HIS NORFOLK COAT AND HIS VERY HIGH COLLARS WERE A LITTLE UNCONVENTIONAL
AFTER SHE LAY DOWN THERE SHE SEEMED NOT TO HAVE MOVED AN EYELASH
SHE WAS DRAGGING HERSELF TOWARD THE HEDGE
STOP A MINUTE AND LOOK AT ME
POLITICS BEING THE NATURAL FIELD FOR SUCH TALENTS HE NEGLECTS HIS FARM TO ATTEND CONVENTIONS AND TO RUN FOR COUNTY OFFICES
SHE HAD NOT WORN HER APRON FOR FEAR OF RUMPLING IT AND NOW SHE SHOOK IT OUT AND TIED IT ROUND HER WAIST WITH A CONSCIOUS AIR
EMIL FELT A NEW THRILL OF ADMIRATION FOR HIS FRIEND AND WITH IT THE OLD PANG OF ENVY AT THE WAY IN WHICH AMEDEE COULD DO WITH HIS MIGHT WHAT HIS HAND FOUND TO DO AND FEEL THAT WHATEVER IT WAS IT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD
WE'D NEVER HAVE BOUGHT THE PLACE IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THIS ORCHARD AND THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD ALEXANDRA EITHER SHE GAVE ALEXANDRA'S ARM A LITTLE SQUEEZE AS SHE WALKED BESIDE HER
THE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT YOUR OLD PLACE
IS EVERYTHING DOWN THERE BEAUTIFUL LIKE THESE
THEN HE WENT OUT TO THE ROAD WHERE HE TOOK THE FOOT-PATH ALONG THE OUTSIDE OF THE ORCHARD HEDGE
HE DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AND SAT LOOKING STOLIDLY AT THE FLOOR HIS HANDS HANGING LOOSELY BETWEEN HIS KNEES THE HANDKERCHIEF LYING ACROSS HIS STRIPED LEG
YOU MUST BRING MR LINSTRUM OVER REAL SOON ONLY BE SURE TO TELEPHONE ME FIRST SHE CALLED BACK AS CARL HELPED HER INTO THE CARRIAGE
HE GLANCED AT ALEXANDRA SULLENLY BLINKED AS IF HE HAD COME FROM A DARK PLACE AND ONE EYEBROW TWITCHED CONTINUALLY
EMIL SMILED TOLERANTLY AND STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH HIS OLD BROODING GAZE WHILE THE FRENCH GIRLS FLUTTERED ABOUT HIM IN THEIR WHITE DRESSES AND RIBBONS AND ALEXANDRA WATCHED THE SCENE WITH PRIDE
IT SEEMED LIKE A LIGHT SHINING FAR AWAY
I HAVE GREAT HOPES OF MILLY EMIL SHIVERED
HE SEEMED TO FEEL THAT BY HIS OWN IRREPROACHABLE REGULARITY HE WOULD CLEAR HIMSELF OF BLAME AND REPROVE THE WEATHER
IN THE SKY THE PALE HALF-MOON WAS SLOWLY SILVERING
THE GATE STARED HIM IN THE FACE
AND WHAT ABOUT MY WORK SHE ASKED IN AN UNSTEADY VOICE
MOTHER WILL WANT HER POTATOES
GIVE THEM ONLY GRAIN AND CLEAN FEED SUCH AS YOU WOULD GIVE HORSES OR CATTLE
SHE DISAPPROVED OF ALL HER NEIGHBORS BECAUSE OF THEIR SLOVENLY HOUSEKEEPING AND THE WOMEN THOUGHT HER VERY PROUD
SADIE MILLY RUN TELL YOUR FATHER AND UNCLE OSCAR THAT OUR OLD FRIEND CARL LINSTRUM IS HERE
I'M SURE I DON'T WANT TO LIVE TO BE MORE THAN THIRTY DO YOU
SHE WAITED A MOMENT BUT HE DID NOT STIR
CARL ROSE AND TOOK HER DOWN TO THE CARRIAGE WHILE LOU LINGERED FOR A WORD WITH HIS SISTER
HIS FACE WAS TURNED UP TO THE SKY AND HIS BROWS WERE DRAWN IN A FROWN AS IF HE HAD REALIZED THAT SOMETHING HAD BEFALLEN HIM
FOR ELEVEN YEARS SHE HAD WORTHILY STRIVEN TO MAINTAIN SOME SEMBLANCE OF HOUSEHOLD ORDER AMID CONDITIONS THAT MADE ORDER VERY DIFFICULT
SHE LOOKED FIXEDLY UP THE BLEAK STREET AS IF SHE WERE GATHERING HER STRENGTH TO FACE SOMETHING AS IF SHE WERE TRYING WITH ALL HER MIGHT TO GRASP A SITUATION WHICH NO MATTER HOW PAINFUL MUST BE MET AND DEALT WITH SOMEHOW
WE NEVER QUESTIONED ANYTHING YOU DID
BUT THAT IS NOT THE WAY OF THIS COUNTRY
GIVE HIM LOU SHOUTED
THEY WERE BOTH MORE PERSONAL AND MORE PAINSTAKING
CARL SAT AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE TWO WOMEN HIS BACK TO THE WHEATFIELD AND WATCHED THEM
YOU ARE ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN US MISTRESS
FROM TIME TO TIME HE ROSE AND WANDERED ABOUT THE HOUSE PICKING UP STRAY VOLUMES AND BRINGING THEM LISTLESSLY BACK TO HIS BOX
HE UNDERSTOOD HER AND WENT DOWN TO PLAY CARDS WITH THE BOYS
HE COULD FEEL NOTHING BUT THE SENSE OF DIMINISHING DISTANCE
I FIND IT EASY TO BE FRANK WITH YOU ABOUT EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN EXCEPT--YOURSELF YOU ARE AFRAID OF HURTING MY FEELINGS PERHAPS ALEXANDRA LOOKED AT HIM THOUGHTFULLY
THE WHEAT-CUTTING SOMETIMES GOES ON ALL NIGHT AS WELL AS ALL DAY AND IN GOOD SEASONS THERE ARE SCARCELY MEN AND HORSES ENOUGH TO DO THE HARVESTING
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR HANS ANDERSEN BOOK SAYS CARL ABOUT THE SWEDES LIKING TO BUY DANISH BREAD AND THE DANES LIKING TO BUY SWEDISH BREAD BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS THINK THE BREAD OF ANOTHER COUNTRY IS BETTER THAN THEIR OWN
CARL REALIZED THAT HE WAS NOT A VERY HELPFUL COMPANION BUT THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD SAY
I SAW THE LINSTRUMS WAGON IN TOWN
ONE WINTER HIS CATTLE HAD PERISHED IN A BLIZZARD
NOT-A-MUCH I WON'T
ALEXANDRA DID NOT GET ON WITH OSCAR'S WIFE AT ALL
SINCE THEN HER STORY HAD BEEN A PART OF THE HISTORY OF THE DIVIDE
WHY COULD HE NEVER NEVER FIND THE THING HE LOOKED FOR IN HER PLAYFUL AFFECTIONATE EYES
NOW I SHALL HAVE NOBODY BUT EMIL
WHILE HE WAS THINKING DULLY OF THIS IN SOME LESS SENSITIZED PART OF HIS BRAIN HIS ACUTER FACULTIES WERE GOING OVER AND OVER THE CRIES HE HAD HEARD IN THE ORCHARD
HE AND AMEDEE HAD RIDDEN AND WRESTLED AND LARKED TOGETHER SINCE THEY WERE LADS OF TWELVE
THE LINSTRUMS SHE SAID CALMLY AS SHE PUT ANOTHER PLATE OF HOT BISCUIT ON THE TABLE ARE GOING BACK TO ST LOUIS
IF SHE WAS GOING TO MARRY SHE OUGHT TO DONE IT LONG AGO AND NOT GO MAKING A FOOL OF HERSELF NOW LOU LOOKED ANXIOUS NEVERTHELESS
DID THEY NEVER WEAR HATS
CARL AND ALEXANDRA HAD BEEN TALKING SINCE MORNING
MANY OF THEM HAD NEVER WORKED ON A FARM UNTIL THEY TOOK UP THEIR HOMESTEADS
MARIE SAT SEWING OR CROCHETING AND TRIED TO TAKE A FRIENDLY INTEREST IN THE GAME BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT THE WIDE FIELDS OUTSIDE WHERE THE SNOW WAS DRIFTING OVER THE FENCES
I THINK AT THE DEPOT THEY HAVE SOME SPIKES I CAN STRAP ON MY FEET
NOBODY HAS COME TO ME WITH SUCH TALK SHE SAID DECIDEDLY
THE TWO BOYS BALANCED EACH OTHER AND THEY PULLED WELL TOGETHER
YOU WANNA GET SOME NICE FRENCH GIRL NOW
THEY DID NOT QUICKEN THEIR PACE WHEN THEY SAW CARL
IN THE DRAW BELOW HIS GUN IN HIS HANDS WAS EMIL ADVANCING CAUTIOUSLY WITH A YOUNG WOMAN BESIDE HIM
IT HURTS THEIR FEELINGS IF YOU DON'T
THAT IS ALEXANDRA WANTED TO DETAIN HIM
WELL THEN IT WILL BE A HANDSOME WEDDING PARTY SHE MADE A DROLL FACE AT EMIL WHO FLUSHED
WE HAVE HAD A QUARREL
THERE HAD NOT BEEN SUCH SNOWSTORMS IN TWENTY YEARS AND THE PATH ACROSS THE FIELDS WAS DRIFTED DEEP FROM CHRISTMAS UNTIL MARCH
BESIDES MARIE CARL IS THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE EVER HAD EMIL WAS AWAKE NOW
I GOTTA GREEN MAN RUNNING IT AND I GOTTA TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM EMIL THOUGHT THE LAD WAS UNNATURALLY FLUSHED AND MORE EXCITED THAN EVEN THE CARES OF MANAGING A BIG FARM AT A CRITICAL TIME WARRANTED
ON SUNDAYS AND HOLIDAYS THEY WERE ALWAYS ARM IN ARM
SHE REMEMBERED SOME LINES FROM A POEM SHE HAD LIKED IN HER SCHOOLDAYS HENCEFORTH THE WORLD WILL ONLY BE A WIDER PRISON-HOUSE TO ME AND SIGHED
HE WAS DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING AND NOT THE JOLLYING KIND
BUT ALEXANDRA HE SAID SADLY AND WISTFULLY I'VE NEVER BEEN ANY REAL HELP TO YOU BEYOND SOMETIMES TRYING TO KEEP THE BOYS IN A GOOD HUMOR ALEXANDRA SMILED AND SHOOK HER HEAD
WE OUGHT TO DO MORE THAN THEY DO AND SEE FURTHER AHEAD
THE VARIEGATED FIELDS ARE ALL ONE COLOR NOW
HE MUST BE THERE BY THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER
SIGNA IS APT TO BE SKITTISH AT MEALTIME WHEN THE MEN ARE ABOUT AND TO SPILL THE COFFEE OR UPSET THE CREAM
ALEXANDRA WAKENED IN THE MORNING WITH NOTHING WORSE THAN A HARD COLD AND A STIFF SHOULDER
WHILE MARIE WAS CHATTERING TO THE FRENCH BOYS AMEDEE CALLED EMIL TO THE BACK OF THE ROOM AND WHISPERED TO HIM THAT THEY WERE GOING TO PLAY A JOKE ON THE GIRLS
I THOUGHT THAT DAY THERE WAS SOME KIND OF FEELING SOMETHING UNUSUAL BETWEEN THEM
A FEW DAYS IF ALEXANDRA CAN KEEP ME I EXPECT YOU'LL BE WANTING TO SEE YOUR OLD PLACE LOU OBSERVED MORE CORDIALLY
SHE CAME IN THE AFTERNOON AND KEPT FLYING ABOUT THE POND AND SCREAMING UNTIL DARK
THAT TOO WAS BEAUTIFUL THAT SIMPLE DOORWAY INTO FORGETFULNESS
FRANK AND LOU BERGSON HAD VERY SIMILAR IDEAS AND THEY WERE TWO OF THE POLITICAL AGITATORS OF THE COUNTY
UNDER A WHITE MULBERRY TREE THERE WAS AN OLD WAGON-SEAT
PERHAPS HE COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN IT UP IF HE HAD TRIED
WHEN I WAS ON THE TRAIN THIS MORNING AND WE GOT NEAR HANOVER I FELT SOMETHING LIKE I DID WHEN I DROVE BACK WITH EMIL FROM THE RIVER THAT TIME IN THE DRY YEAR
IN THE WARM BREATHLESS NIGHT AIR HE HEARD A MURMURING SOUND PERFECTLY INARTICULATE AS LOW AS THE SOUND OF WATER COMING FROM A SPRING WHERE THERE IS NO FALL AND WHERE THERE ARE NO STONES TO FRET IT
SHE BLAMED MARIE BITTERLY
IN THE FENCING AND HEDGING IN THE WINDBREAKS AND SHEDS IN THE SYMMETRICAL PASTURE PONDS PLANTED WITH SCRUB WILLOWS TO GIVE SHADE TO THE CATTLE IN FLY-TIME
I'M GLAD I'M NOT LOU'S MOTHER-IN-LAW IVAR LOOKED ABOUT MYSTERIOUSLY AND LOWERED HIS VOICE ALMOST TO A WHISPER
BUT YOU YOURSELF CARL--WITH THAT BEARD--HOW COULD I HAVE KNOWN YOU
I SHOULD SAY WE HAD
IT WAS A STILL DEEP-BREATHING SUMMER NIGHT FULL OF THE SMELL OF THE HAY FIELDS
THE YOUNG PEOPLE THEY LIVE SO HARD
NO I'M AFRAID OF GIVING YOU A SHOCK
NOW WHEN I COME BACK TO ALL THIS MILK AND HONEY I FEEL LIKE THE OLD GERMAN SONG WO BIST DU WO BIST DU MEIN GELIEBTEST LAND?'--DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE THAT I WONDER YES SOMETIMES WHEN I THINK ABOUT FATHER AND MOTHER AND THOSE WHO ARE GONE
AT LAST HE SEEMED TO SEE A RAY OF HOPE
YOU WERE AWFUL GOOD TO CLIMB SO HIGH AND GET MY KITTEN CARL
IN A MOMENT SHE HEARD EMIL AND RAOUL SINGING ACROSS THE RIO GRAND-E THERE LIES A SUNNY LAND-E MY BRIGHT-EYED MEXICO ALEXANDRA BERGSON CAME UP TO THE CARD BOOTH
MAYBE EMIL WILL COME OUT AN HAVE A LOOK AT IT WID ME HE PUSHED BACK HIS CHAIR TOOK HIS HAT FROM THE NAIL AND MARCHED OUT WITH EMIL WHO WITH HIS UNIVERSITY IDEAS WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE INSTIGATED THE SILO
BUT ON THE FIRST DAY OF DECEMBER ALEXANDRA TELEPHONED ANNIE THAT TO-MORROW SHE WOULD SEND IVAR OVER FOR HER MOTHER AND THE NEXT DAY THE OLD LADY ARRIVED WITH HER BUNDLES
WE GAVE WALL STREET A SCARE IN NINETY-SIX ALL RIGHT AND WE'RE FIXING ANOTHER TO HAND THEM
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT
ALEXANDRA HAD HAD IT MADE FROM A LITTLE PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN FOR HIS FRIENDS JUST BEFORE HE LEFT SWEDEN
HIS BROTHERS HAD SHOWN THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF HIM EVER SINCE HE FIRST WENT AWAY TO SCHOOL
THEY WOULD NOT COME IN BUT SAT IN THE SHADE OF THE BANK OUTSIDE WHILE ALEXANDRA AND IVAR TALKED ABOUT THE BIRDS AND ABOUT HIS HOUSEKEEPING AND WHY HE NEVER ATE MEAT FRESH OR SALT
THERE ARE WOMEN WHO SPREAD RUIN AROUND THEM THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIRS JUST BY BEING TOO BEAUTIFUL TOO FULL OF LIFE AND LOVE
JA JA WE WILL SEE
BESIDE IT LAY A BOOK AND A WORKBASKET
THEY TOLD HER THAT SHE MUST CHOOSE ONE OF THEM FOR A SWEETHEART AND EACH BEGAN PRESSING HIS SUIT AND OFFERING HER BRIBES
SHE WAS STANDING PERFECTLY STILL WITH THAT SERIOUS EASE SO CHARACTERISTIC OF HER
BUT YOU CAN'T EXPECT US TO SIT LIKE STUMPS AND SEE YOU DONE OUT OF THE PROPERTY BY ANY LOAFER WHO HAPPENS ALONG AND MAKING YOURSELF RIDICULOUS INTO THE BARGAIN OSCAR ROSE
HE LOOKED ACROSS THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE AT FRANK SHABATA WITH CALMNESS
NEVER ANY CONFUSION
IT WAS LIKE A SIGH WHICH THEY HAD BREATHED TOGETHER
SHE PUT HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER
THEN I'M THANKFUL TO YOU MR LINSTRUM
SHE OFTEN FELT THAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN MORE TO BLAME THAN POOR FRANK
ONLY IT IS WE WHO WRITE IT WITH THE BEST WE HAVE THEY PAUSED ON THE LAST RIDGE OF THE PASTURE OVERLOOKING THE HOUSE AND THE WINDMILL AND THE STABLES THAT MARKED THE SITE OF JOHN BERGSON'S HOMESTEAD
BUT OF COURSE THE REAL WORK ALWAYS FELL ON US
I THINK SHE LIKED HIM TOO YES I THINK SHE DID ALEXANDRA ASSENTED BUT I SUPPOSE SHE WAS TOO MUCH AFRAID OF NELSE TO MARRY ANY ONE ELSE
THE SIX BIG WORK-HORSES THAT DREW OR RATHER PUSHED THE HEADER WENT ABREAST AT A RAPID WALK AND AS THEY WERE STILL GREEN AT THE WORK THEY REQUIRED A GOOD DEAL OF MANAGEMENT ON AMEDEE'S PART
DIDN'T ALL THE LAND COME OUT OF THE HOMESTEAD
THE SETTLERS SAT ABOUT ON THE WOODEN SIDEWALKS IN THE LITTLE TOWN AND TOLD EACH OTHER THAT THE COUNTRY WAS NEVER MEANT FOR MEN TO LIVE IN
IT IS NOT HER SEASON OF COURSE
AFTER THE BELL BEGAN TO RING HE SAW FRANK SHABATA RIDE UP ON HORSEBACK AND TIE HIS HORSE TO THE HITCH-BAR
HE WAS A LITTLE ASHAMED FOR HIS SISTER THOUGH HE HAD TRIED NOT TO SHOW IT
HE HAD NOT YET LEARNED TO KEEP AWAY FROM THE SHELL-GAME WAGONS THAT FOLLOWED THE CIRCUS
WHAT I HAVE IS YOURS IF YOU CARE ENOUGH ABOUT ME TO TAKE IT CARL ROSE AND LOOKED UP AT THE PICTURE OF JOHN BERGSON
I WOULDN'T SELL IN THE SPRING WHEN EVERYBODY ADVISED ME TO AND NOW SO MANY PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR HOGS THAT I AM FRIGHTENED
AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR ME SHE THOUGHT FRANK MIGHT STILL BE FREE LIKE THAT AND HAVING A GOOD TIME MAKING PEOPLE ADMIRE HIM
HER EYES WERE LIGHTLY CLOSED AS IF IN A DAY-DREAM OR A LIGHT SLUMBER
THE YOUNGEST
ALEXANDRA DOES
SIMPLY WHEN I WAS WITH THOSE TWO YOUNG THINGS I FELT MY BLOOD GO QUICKER I FELT--HOW SHALL I SAY IT?--AN ACCELERATION OF LIFE
THE OLD MAN SPRANG TO THE GROUND AND SHUFFLED TOWARD THE GATE CALLING MISTRESS MISTRESS ALEXANDRA HURRIED TO MEET HIM AND PUT HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER
HE TIED HER IN THE STABLE AND HURRIED TO THE HOUSE
THE WOMAN LYING IN THE SHADOW MIGHT SO EASILY BE ONE OF THE BERGSONS FARM-GIRLS
THEY HAD WORN THEIR COATS TO TOWN BUT THEY ATE IN THEIR STRIPED SHIRTS AND SUSPENDERS
HE WAS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF HER ROOM
THE HEDGE WAS TWICE AS TALL AS FRANK HIMSELF AND SO DENSE THAT ONE COULD SEE THROUGH IT ONLY BY PEERING CLOSELY BETWEEN THE LEAVES
ALL AT ONCE HE HEARD HER CRIES AGAIN--HE HAD FORGOTTEN FOR A MOMENT
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S ALEXANDRA BERGSON COME TO THIS WITH NO HEAD ABOUT ANYTHING
THERE WAS TROUBLE ENOUGH IN THE WORLD HE REFLECTED AS HE THREW HIMSELF UPON HIS BED WITHOUT PEOPLE WHO WERE FORTY YEARS OLD IMAGINING THEY WANTED TO GET MARRIED
BUT FOR THE PIECE OF RUSTY STOVEPIPE STICKING UP THROUGH THE SOD YOU COULD HAVE WALKED OVER THE ROOF OF IVAR'S DWELLING WITHOUT DREAMING THAT YOU WERE NEAR A HUMAN HABITATION
IF THE REST OF YOU GO I WILL ASK SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS TO TAKE ME IN AND STAY AND BE BURIED BY FATHER
I SUPPOSE I AM MORE LIKE THAT ALEXANDRA HE SAID SUDDENLY THAT OLD WALNUT SECRETARY YOU USE FOR A DESK WAS FATHER'S WASN'T IT ALEXANDRA WENT ON STITCHING
WHAT FINE BOYS HE SAID TO HIS PRIESTS
GOOD-BYE
IT WAS THREE MONTHS NOW SINCE THE NEWS OF THE TERRIBLE THING THAT HAD HAPPENED IN FRANK SHABATA'S ORCHARD HAD FIRST RUN LIKE A FIRE OVER THE DIVIDE
MARIE TOOK OUT A PAN OF DELICATE LITTLE ROLLS STUFFED WITH STEWED APRICOTS AND BEGAN TO DUST THEM OVER WITH POWDERED SUGAR
HOW YOU HATED COWS SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND LAUGHED TO HERSELF
OH EMIL YOU WANNA GET MARRIED RIGHT OFF QUICK
PEOPLE HAVE TO SNATCH AT HAPPINESS WHEN THEY CAN IN THIS WORLD
HE SAYS IVAR'S CASE IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS KIND AND IT'S A WONDER HE HASN'T DONE SOMETHING VIOLENT BEFORE THIS ALEXANDRA LAUGHED GOOD-HUMOREDLY
IT MAKES HIM FOOLISH LOU SNIFFED
YES SHE GOES TO SCHOOL IN TOWN AND SHE IS THE YOUNGEST IN HER CLASS BY TWO YEARS MILLY LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE AND CARL TOOK HER HAND AGAIN
THEN WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT SHE ASKED CANDIDLY
BUT YOU MUST SEE THAT YOU ASTONISH ME
THE BERGSON BOYS CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPIER WITH THEIR UNCLE OTTO IN THE BAKERY SHOP IN CHICAGO
HE CRIED QUIETLY AND THE FEW PEOPLE WHO HURRIED BY DID NOT NOTICE HIM
BUT AS ALEXANDRA HAD POINTEDLY TOLD HER SISTERS-IN-LAW IT WAS TO HEAR THEM GIGGLE THAT SHE KEPT THREE YOUNG THINGS IN HER KITCHEN
HE DECIDED THAT HE NEEDED HIS BREAKFAST
ON THE WHOLE THOUGH WE TAKE AS MUCH COMFORT IN EACH OTHER AS MOST BROTHERS AND SISTERS DO
YOU HAVE THE ONLY SAFE PLACE THERE IS
I CAN SEE HIM NOW SITTING THERE ON SUNDAYS IN HIS WHITE SHIRT WRITING PAGES AND PAGES SO CAREFULLY
WHEN MR SCHWARTZ DISAPPEARED ALEXANDRA THRUST HER BLACK-EDGED HANDKERCHIEF NERVOUSLY INTO HER HANDBAG
I NOT FEEL HARD AT NO WOMAN
THE MOON WAS ALMOST FULL
HE HAD REFUSED TO SHARE ANY OF THE LITTLE PLEASURES SHE WAS SO PLUCKY ABOUT MAKING FOR HERSELF
EVEN IN THE COURTROOM HER HEART HAD GRIEVED FOR HIM
DO YOU LIKE MR LINSTRUM MARIE ASKED SUDDENLY
HE DROPPED HIS ARMS AND WENT UP TO THE WAGON SMILING AMIABLY AND LOOKING AT THEM OUT OF HIS PALE BLUE EYES
PERHAPS HE DID NOT REMEMBER--PERHAPS HE HAD NEVER NOTICED
ALL HIS INTERESTS THEY TREATED AS AFFECTATIONS
IT MOST OFTEN CAME TO HER ON SUNDAY MORNINGS THE ONE DAY IN THE WEEK WHEN SHE LAY LATE ABED LISTENING TO THE FAMILIAR MORNING SOUNDS
YES SHE MUST GO TO LINCOLN TO SEE FRANK SHABATA
WHEN IVAR STOPPED AT THE GATE AND SWUNG OUT HIS LANTERN A WHITE FIGURE ROSE FROM BESIDE JOHN BERGSON'S WHITE STONE
YOU PUT ROSEMARY LEAVES IN YOUR CHEST LIKE I TOLD YOU SHE LED THEM TO THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE ORCHARD SHELTERED ON ONE SIDE BY A THICK MULBERRY HEDGE AND BORDERED ON THE OTHER BY A WHEATFIELD JUST BEGINNING TO YELLOW
IF ONLY POOR PEOPLE COULD LEARN A LITTLE FROM RICH PEOPLE
WE ARE GOING TO RENT THE PLACE AND MOVE INTO TOWN AS SOON AS THE GIRLS ARE OLD ENOUGH TO GO OUT INTO COMPANY
IF SHE BEEN IN DAT HOUSE WHERE SHE OUGHT-A BEEN--BUT DAS A FOOLISH TALK FRANK RUBBED HIS HEAD AND STOPPED SUDDENLY AS HE HAD STOPPED BEFORE
THE RECORD OF THE PLOW WAS INSIGNIFICANT LIKE THE FEEBLE SCRATCHES ON STONE LEFT BY PREHISTORIC RACES SO INDETERMINATE THAT THEY MAY AFTER ALL BE ONLY THE MARKINGS OF GLACIERS AND NOT A RECORD OF HUMAN STRIVINGS
IS IT THE WAY YOU HOPED IT WOULD BE ALEXANDRA SMILED AT THIS
I KEEP MY HOGS HOME
I WAS USED TO SEEING FATHER IN A BLUE COAT A SORT OF JACKET AND WHEN I RECOGNIZED HIM ON THE PLATFORM I WAS VERY PROUD
THE TREES OF THE LORD ARE FULL OF SAP
SHE PRAYED FOR HERSELF AND FOR FRANK AND FOR EMIL AMONG THE TEMPTATIONS OF THAT GAY CORRUPT OLD CITY
WE GROW HARD AND HEAVY HERE
AND BY THE WAY EMIL YOU MUSTN'T DANCE WITH ME BUT ONCE OR TWICE
HERE SHE COULD WEAR HER NIGHTCAP AND SLEEP WITH ALL HER WINDOWS SHUT LISTEN TO IVAR READING THE BIBLE AND HERE SHE COULD RUN ABOUT AMONG THE STABLES IN A PAIR OF EMIL'S OLD BOOTS
THERE'S A GOOD MANY THINGS GOT TO BE CHANGED
THE MEN IN TOWN WHO ARE BUYING UP OTHER PEOPLE'S LAND DON'T TRY TO FARM IT
THEN EVERYTHING SEEMED TO GET HARD INSIDE OF ME AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS I SHOULD NEVER CARE FOR YOU AGAIN
BE PATIENT WITH ME ALEXANDRA
THEY CHEERED US A GOOD DEAL AND WE SAVED ALL THE SEEDS AND PLANTED THEM
HE KNEW THE END TOO WELL TO WISH TO BEGIN AGAIN
NOTHING MORE
HE CAUGHT EMIL'S HORSE BY THE BIT AND LED IT OUT
FROM THE FIRST IT WAS MORE MY FAULT THAN HIS EMIL TURNED AWAY HIS FACE
EVERY IMAGE SLIPPED AWAY BUT ONE
ALEXANDRA CONFESSED SHE DIDN'T KNOW
THE GIRLS FELL BEHIND THEIR AUNT AND PEEPED OUT AT HIM FROM AMONG THE CASTOR BEANS
THEN IT CLOSES UP AND THEY FLY ON WITH A NEW EDGE
THAT IT MEANT A DEFINITE BREAK WITH HIS OLD HOME AND THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING NEW--HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT
UNCONSCIOUS RESPECT PROBABLY FOR HE SEEMED INTENT UPON HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND LIKE THE GLADIATOR'S THEY WERE FAR AWAY
HE WOULD MUCH RATHER OF COURSE HAVE SEEN THIS LIKENESS IN ONE OF HIS SONS BUT IT WAS NOT A QUESTION OF CHOICE
ALEXANDRA HAS SETTLED BACK INTO HER OLD ROUTINE
HE HAD BEEN LESS IN THE WRONG THAN ANY OF THEM AND HE WAS PAYING THE HEAVIEST PENALTY
AND KEEP THEM IN A STINKING PEN
SHE MISSED THE FISH DIET OF HER OWN COUNTRY AND TWICE EVERY SUMMER SHE SENT THE BOYS TO THE RIVER TWENTY MILES TO THE SOUTHWARD TO FISH FOR CHANNEL CAT
HE GOES OVER AND OVER IT IN HIS MIND
I'M SO GLAD THESE TREES BELONG TO SOME ONE WHO TAKES COMFORT IN THEM
SIGNA AND NELSE WERE STAYING ON WITH ALEXANDRA UNTIL WINTER
MARIE WAS STANDING ON A CHAIR BUILDING A LITTLE TENT OF SHAWLS WHERE SHE WAS TO TELL FORTUNES
BUT THERE I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN BETTER MYSELF SHE WENT TO THE FOOT OF THE POLE AND HELD OUT HER ARMS CRYING KITTY KITTY KITTY BUT THE KITTEN ONLY MEWED AND FAINTLY WAVED ITS TAIL
BUT YOU DO NEED ME NOW ALEXANDRA SHE PUT HER HAND ON HIS ARM
SHE FELT AT ONCE THAT THIS INTERVIEW WAS A TERRIBLE ORDEAL TO HIM
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
I KNOW I CAN GET YOU OUT OF THIS PLACE FRANK LOOKED AT HER DISTRUSTFULLY BUT HE GATHERED CONFIDENCE FROM HER FACE
HE WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID IN AN EMBARRASSED TONE WHY NO CERTAINLY NOT
SHE DID NOT GO INTO THE GROUNDS BUT WALKED SLOWLY UP AND DOWN THE STONE WALK OUTSIDE THE LONG IRON FENCE LOOKING THROUGH AT THE YOUNG MEN WHO WERE RUNNING FROM ONE BUILDING TO ANOTHER AT THE LIGHTS SHINING FROM THE ARMORY AND THE LIBRARY
I GUESS DAT PLACE ALL GO TO HELL WHAT I WORK SO HARD ON HE SAID WITH A SLOW BITTER SMILE
YOU FRENCHIES LIKE TO BRAG BUT AMEDEE HAD THE ZEAL OF THE NEWLY MARRIED AND HE WAS NOT TO BE LIGHTLY SHAKEN OFF
THE GRASS WOULD STAIN YOUR DRESS THE HOSTESS INSISTED
THEY ALWAYS COME HOME FROM TOWN DISCOURAGED ANYWAY
AMEDEE SLAPPED FRANK ON THE BACK AND ASKED HIM WHY HE DIDN'T SEE WHAT THE FORTUNE-TELLER WOULD PROMISE HIM
SHE GRINNED AT HER AUNT WITH WHOM SHE WAS A GREAT DEAL MORE AT EASE THAN SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER
THERE WAS SOMETHING QUEER ABOUT HIM
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE ONE ALEXANDRA I'M THINKING OF IT
SHE OFTEN SITS THERE AND SEWS
THEN LOU CAME OUT SHARPLY
SEE,"--HE BEGAN CHECKING OFF ON HIS FINGERS,--"THERE IS SEVERINE AND ALPHOSEN AND JOSEPHINE AND HECTORINE AND LOUISE AND MALVINA--WHY I COULD LOVE ANY OF THEM GIRLS
THE DIVIDE IS NOW THICKLY POPULATED
YOU LIKED TO MANAGE ROUND AND WE ALWAYS HUMORED YOU
HER MIND WAS SLOW TRUTHFUL STEADFAST
ONLY YOUR GREAT PROSPERITY HAS PROTECTED ME SO FAR
HE KNEW THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE MEANT
TWO T'REE YEARS I KNOW DAT WOMAN DON CARE NO MORE BOUT ME ALEXANDRA BERGSON
THEY ARE ALWAYS CHANGING LIKE THAT UP IN THE AIR
BUT WHERE DO YOU SLEEP IVAR EMIL ASKED LOOKING ABOUT
IN SOME WAYS IT WOULD BE EASIER
LIKE PULLING A THRESHING-MACHINE OUT OF THE MUD
A SOUND LIKE A WHINE
AND THAT SURELY DID NOT MATTER
THERE HE WAS TURNING OVER A PORTFOLIO OF CHROMO STUDIES WHICH THE DRUGGIST SOLD TO THE HANOVER WOMEN WHO DID CHINA-PAINTING
HIS RIGHT ARM BARED FROM THE ELBOW WAS DARK AND GLEAMING LIKE BRONZE AND SHE KNEW AT ONCE THAT IT WAS THE ARM OF THE MIGHTIEST OF ALL LOVERS
BUT OF COURSE HE IS OLDER THAN FRANK EVEN
SOME OF THEM HAD BROUGHT THEIR WIVES TO TOWN AND NOW AND THEN A RED OR A PLAID SHAWL FLASHED OUT OF ONE STORE INTO THE SHELTER OF ANOTHER
FRANK IS JUST THE SAME NOW AS HE WAS THEN ONLY THEN I WOULD SEE HIM AS I WANTED HIM TO BE
YOU'D HAVE MADE THE BATTERY AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR SURE MEDEE EMIL SAID AS THEY WERE WALKING FROM THE BALL-GROUNDS BACK TO THE CHURCH ON THE HILL
LOU'S WIFE FORMERLY ANNIE LEE HAS GROWN TO LOOK CURIOUSLY LIKE HER HUSBAND
HE COULD NEVER GET OUT OF IT
LOU HE SAYS HE WOULDN'T HAVE NO SILO ON HIS PLACE IF YOU'D GIVE IT TO HIM
THEY SAT FOR A LONG TIME WATCHING THE SOLITARY BIRD TAKE ITS PLEASURE
ALL THE TIME I LIVED HERE IN THE HOUSE I WANTED TO ASK YOU
WHY HAD MARIE MADE HIM DO THIS THING
IT'S A STRANGE THING ALEXANDRA
THERE SHE HAD FALLEN AND BLED
SURE I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
THE FRESH SALTY SCENT OF THE WILD ROSES HAD GIVEN WAY BEFORE THIS MORE POWERFUL PERFUME OF MIDSUMMER
YOU WILL GO TO A TOWN ALL CUT UP BY WATER
HOW SHOULD I KNOW BUT YOU THINK SHE IS AT THE GRAVEYARD DON'T YOU SIGNA PERSISTED
I'VE BEEN BEGGING HIM TO FOR YEARS OSCAR LOOKED AT ALEXANDRA
BUT WHEN CARL LINSTRUM CAME UP THE GARDEN ROWS TO FIND HER SHE WAS NOT WORKING
ALEXANDRA AND MARIE ACCOMPANIED SIGNA TO THE GATE AND SAW THE PARTY SET OFF OLD IVAR DRIVING AHEAD IN THE WAGON AND THE BRIDE AND GROOM FOLLOWING ON FOOT EACH LEADING A COW
LOOK OUT
FRANK'S WIFE OUGHT TO BE TIMID AND SHE OUGHT NOT TO CARE ABOUT ANOTHER LIVING THING IN THE WORLD BUT JUST FRANK
AS SHE LAY ALONE IN THE DARK IT OCCURRED TO HER FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT PERHAPS SHE WAS ACTUALLY TIRED OF LIFE
WHY CARL HOW DID IT HAPPEN
I MAY HAVE TO LOOK THROUGH MY OLD TRUNKS MARIE CAUGHT UP A SHAWL AND OPENED THE STAIR DOOR RUNNING UP THE STEPS AHEAD OF HER GUEST
HE WASHES HIMSELF ALL OVER THREE TIMES A WEEK NOW AND USES ALL THE HOT WATER
YOU CAN TALK TO HIM HERE WHILE I GO TO SEE TO THINGS IN THE KITCHEN
ONE JUNE MORNING A YOUNG MAN STOOD AT THE GATE OF THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD SHARPENING HIS SCYTHE IN STROKES UNCONSCIOUSLY TIMED TO THE TUNE HE WAS WHISTLING
HE TALKED BITTERLY TO HIMSELF WHILE HE PUT HIS OWN HORSE AWAY AND AS HE WENT UP THE PATH AND SAW THAT THE HOUSE WAS DARK HE FELT AN ADDED SENSE OF INJURY
WHEN A DRUMMER HAD BEEN KNOCKING ABOUT IN LITTLE DRAB TOWNS AND CRAWLING ACROSS THE WINTRY COUNTRY IN DIRTY SMOKING-CARS WAS HE TO BE BLAMED IF WHEN HE CHANCED UPON A FINE HUMAN CREATURE HE SUDDENLY WISHED HIMSELF MORE OF A MAN
I WANT TO BE DOING SOMETHING ON MY OWN ACCOUNT THAT'S SO MARIE SIGHED
THERE WAS A WRENCH IN FRANK'S MIND
SHE THOUGHT OF HOW HE HAD COME TO THIS COUNTRY A GAY YOUNG FELLOW SO ATTRACTIVE THAT THE PRETTIEST BOHEMIAN GIRL IN OMAHA HAD RUN AWAY WITH HIM
THIS TIME HE HEARD IT MORE DISTINCTLY AND HIS BLOOD WAS QUICKER THAN HIS BRAIN
THEY ARE QUICKLY CLEANED AGAIN SIGNA DID NOT LAUGH
THE POINT OF THE WEDGE GETS THE WORST OF IT
BERGSON HAD SPENT HIS FIRST FIVE YEARS ON THE DIVIDE GETTING INTO DEBT AND THE LAST SIX GETTING OUT
MARIE SAID EMIL AFTER THEY HAD WALKED FOR A WHILE I WONDER IF YOU KNOW HOW UNHAPPY I AM MARIE DID NOT ANSWER HIM
IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE HURT A WOMAN
BECAUSE HE FELT THAT MEN WERE TOO WEAK TO MAKE ANY MARK HERE THAT THE LAND WANTED TO BE LET ALONE TO PRESERVE ITS OWN FIERCE STRENGTH ITS PECULIAR SAVAGE KIND OF BEAUTY ITS UNINTERRUPTED MOURNFULNESS
VERRA STRONG NO WA-ASH OUT NO FADE
SHE WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT THE NEIGHBORS HAD A GOOD DEAL TO PUT UP WITH AND THAT THEY BORE WITH FRANK FOR HER SAKE
SOD CORN IS GOOD FOR FODDER
MARIE HAVING SEEN HER GUESTS OFF CAME IN AND PUT HER HAND COAXINGLY ON HIS SHOULDER
ANNIE THREW UP HER CHIN
YES I THINK I DID
I DON'T FEEL HARD TOWARD YOU
IT WAS JUST THERE THAT HE AND ALEXANDRA USED TO DO THEIR MILKING TOGETHER HE ON HIS SIDE OF THE FENCE SHE ON HERS
ALEXANDRA HE SAID SLOWLY IN HIS DEEP YOUNG BARITONE I DON'T WANT TO GO AWAY TO LAW SCHOOL THIS FALL
THE STORY OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS WRITTEN PLAINLY ON THE ORCHARD GRASS AND ON THE WHITE MULBERRIES THAT HAD FALLEN IN THE NIGHT AND WERE COVERED WITH DARK STAIN
HE WAS EASILY THE BUCK OF THE BEER-GARDENS AND ON SUNDAY HE WAS A SIGHT TO SEE WITH HIS SILK HAT AND TUCKED SHIRT AND BLUE FROCK-COAT WEARING GLOVES AND CARRYING A LITTLE WISP OF A YELLOW CANE
HE NEVER SAID MUCH ABOUT THEM BUT SHE COULD FEEL HIS DISGUST
HE WAS PLAYING WITH A LITTLE BOHEMIAN GIRL MARIE TOVESKY WHO WAS TYING HER HANDKERCHIEF OVER THE KITTEN'S HEAD FOR A BONNET
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HE'S COME FOR HE ASKED JERKING HIS HEAD TOWARD THE GATE
LATE IN LIFE HE MARRIED A SECOND TIME A STOCKHOLM WOMAN OF QUESTIONABLE CHARACTER MUCH YOUNGER THAN HE WHO GOADED HIM INTO EVERY SORT OF EXTRAVAGANCE
I DIDN'T TELEPHONE HER WE WERE COMING BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HER TO GO TO WORK AND BAKE CAKE AND FREEZE ICE-CREAM
ALEXANDRA NODDED AND HE CAME IN AND TOUCHED THE WHITE BUTTON ON HIS DESK
HE WATCHES OVER THEM AND COUNTS THEM AS WE DO OUR CATTLE
IF YOU GO UP THE HILL AND ENTER ALEXANDRA'S BIG HOUSE YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS CURIOUSLY UNFINISHED AND UNEVEN IN COMFORT
IS IT SETTLED YES FATHER HAS HEARD FROM ST LOUIS AND THEY WILL GIVE HIM BACK HIS OLD JOB IN THE CIGAR FACTORY
SHE DROPPED IT BESIDE CARL
YOU SIMPLY COULDN'T BE DIFFERENT
IT WAS HIGH TIME THAT HE MADE GOOD TO ALEXANDRA AND THAT OUGHT TO BE INCENTIVE ENOUGH TO BEGIN WITH
I DON'T WANT TO MOVE AGAIN
I TRY TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE NOT ALL MADE ALIKE
BEFORE THE HORSES WERE OVER THE FIRST HILL EMIL AND HIS CAT WERE BOTH FAST ASLEEP
I'D TAKE THE FIRST TRAIN AND GO OFF AND HAVE ALL THE FUN THERE IS I TRIED THAT BUT IT DIDN'T DO ANY GOOD
COMING OUT ON THE STREETCAR SHE HAD NOT HAD THE LEAST DREAD OF MEETING FRANK
I KEEP THE FIRE ALL NIGHT MRS LEE AND WHEN IT'S VERY COLD I PUT THEM ALL ON THE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
THE BOYS WENT TO THE STABLE TO SEE TO THE STOCK AND THEY WERE GONE A LONG WHILE
AT THE UNIVERSITY DANCES THE GIRLS HAD OFTEN LOOKED WONDERINGLY AT THE TALL YOUNG SWEDE WITH THE FINE HEAD LEANING AGAINST THE WALL AND FROWNING HIS ARMS FOLDED HIS EYES FIXED ON THE CEILING OR THE FLOOR
YOU SAY YOU OUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN THINGS INTO YOUR OWN HANDS YEARS AGO
THERE'S NO WOMAN ANYWHERE AROUND THAT KNOWS AS MUCH ABOUT BUSINESS AS YOU DO AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN PROUD OF THAT AND THOUGHT YOU WERE PRETTY SMART
ONLY DON'T GO OFF LOOKING FOR LAND SHE CAME UP AND PUT HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER
BUILD A SHED TO GIVE THEM SHADE A THATCH ON POLES
IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THEIR LOVE SHE HAD BEEN HIS SLAVE
SINCE THEN WHEN HE HAD HAPPENED TO SEE THE SUN COME UP IN THE COUNTRY OR ON THE WATER HE HAD OFTEN REMEMBERED THE YOUNG SWEDISH GIRL AND HER MILKING PAILS
HE USED TO BE AWFULLY GAY LIKE THAT WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN
WHEN THE GROUND WAS LEVEL HE TURNED HER OUT OF THE DIRT ROAD UPON THE SOD WHERE SHE WAS ABLE TO TROT WITHOUT SLIPPING
IF PEOPLE LAUGHED AT HER SHE LAUGHED WITH THEM
FRANK SHABATA I AM NEVER GOING TO STOP TRYING UNTIL I GET YOU PARDONED
THEY WERE ALWAYS AFRAID OF ALEXANDRA'S SCHEMES
AND I AM VERY FOND OF LOU'S OLDEST DAUGHTER I THINK I LIKED THE OLD LOU AND OSCAR BETTER AND THEY PROBABLY FEEL THE SAME ABOUT ME
FRANK SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET AND RAN ON GROANING AND PRAYING
ANGEL NOT SICK AT ALL
THAT WAS THE STRANGEST THING OF ALL
HE PREFERRED THE CLEANNESS AND TIDINESS OF THE WILD SOD
HE THOUGHT A CAVE A VERY SUPERIOR KIND OF HOUSE
I KNOW YOU NEVER MEANT TO HURT MARIE FRANK SMILED AT HER QUEERLY
THAT'S IT
AND NOW MARIE WENT ON I'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT
THE SECOND OF THESE BARREN SUMMERS WAS PASSING
HE ALWAYS FELT SHY AND AWKWARD HERE AND WANTED TO HIDE BEHIND THINGS FOR FEAR SOME ONE MIGHT LAUGH AT HIM
HIS SHOULDERS SEEMED AS STRONG AS THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD
MARIE DREW BACK AND THREW UP HER HANDS EXCLAIMING OH WHAT A BEAUTY
IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE BOUGHT FOR THE OLD LOG HOUSE
MR SCHWARTZ IF YOU HAVE TIME I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT FRANK SHABATA AND WHY I AM INTERESTED IN HIM THE WARDEN LISTENED GENIALLY WHILE SHE TOLD HIM BRIEFLY SOMETHING OF FRANK'S HISTORY AND CHARACTER BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO FIND ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN HER ACCOUNT
SHE AIN'T GOT NO NAME FOR ME NO MORE
SHE FELT AS THE POND MUST FEEL WHEN IT HELD THE MOON LIKE THAT
THEN THE NEXT THING TO DO IS TO TAKE OUT TWO LOANS ON OUR HALF-SECTIONS AND BUY PETER CROW'S PLACE
HE STUDIED ALEXANDRA'S FACE FOR A LONG TIME IN THE LAMPLIGHT
HE KNEW THAT SOMEWHERE SHE MUST GET A FEELING TO LIVE UPON FOR SHE WAS NOT A WOMAN WHO COULD LIVE WITHOUT LOVING
ON THIS SUNDAY AFTERNOON HIS FACE SHONE WITH HAPPINESS
THE BERGSON WAGON LURCHED ALONG OVER THE ROUGH HUMMOCKS AND GRASS BANKS FOLLOWED THE BOTTOM OF WINDING DRAWS OR SKIRTED THE MARGIN OF WIDE LAGOONS WHERE THE GOLDEN COREOPSIS GREW UP OUT OF THE CLEAR WATER AND THE WILD DUCKS ROSE WITH A WHIRR OF WINGS
NO LIVING THING HAD EVER SEEMED TO ALEXANDRA AS BEAUTIFUL AS THAT WILD DUCK
AT YOUR AGE NOW
PRODUCED BY MARTIN ROBB O PIONEERS
FRANK CLENCHED HIS FIST AND BROKE OUT IN EXCITEMENT
YOU DON'T HELP THINGS ANY BY PRETENDING
THE BERGSON HOMESTEAD WAS EASIER TO FIND THAN MANY ANOTHER BECAUSE IT OVERLOOKED NORWAY CREEK A SHALLOW MUDDY STREAM THAT SOMETIMES FLOWED AND SOMETIMES STOOD STILL AT THE BOTTOM OF A WINDING RAVINE WITH STEEP SHELVING SIDES OVERGROWN WITH BRUSH AND COTTONWOODS AND DWARF ASH
TO AVOID AWKWARD ENCOUNTERS IN THE PRESENCE OF CURIOUS SPECTATORS SHE HAS STOPPED GOING TO THE NORWEGIAN CHURCH AND DRIVES UP TO THE REFORM CHURCH AT HANOVER OR GOES WITH MARIE SHABATA TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH LOCALLY KNOWN AS THE FRENCH CHURCH SHE HAS NOT TOLD MARIE ABOUT CARL OR HER DIFFERENCES WITH HER BROTHERS
HE NEVER WAS MUCH ACCOUNT ALEXANDRA LEFT THEM AND HURRIED DOWN TO THE GATE WHERE ANNIE WAS RATTLING ON TO CARL ABOUT HER NEW DINING-ROOM FURNITURE
HE DIDN'T CARE
AS EMIL RODE HOMEWARDS AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON HE SAW AMEDEE STAGGERING OUT OF THE WHEATFIELD SUPPORTED BY TWO OF HIS COUSINS
HER THICK REDDISH BRAIDS TWISTED ABOUT HER HEAD FAIRLY BURNED IN THE SUNLIGHT
THEN YOU CAN SELL A GARDEN PATCH ANYWHERE AND PAY OFF A DEBT OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
I CANNOT EVEN ASK YOU TO GIVE ME A PROMISE UNTIL I HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER YOU
IT'S MADE AN AWFUL ROW
ITS WOOERS ARE FOUND AMONG THE YOUNG THE PASSIONATE THE GALLANT-HEARTED
AS IT WAS THEY RESENTED EVERY CHANGE IN HIS SPEECH IN HIS DRESS IN HIS POINT OF VIEW
THEN YOU ARE GLAD TO SEE ME AND YOU CAN PUT ME UP OVERNIGHT
A DARK MOVING MASS CAME OVER THE WESTERN HILL THE LEE BOY WAS BRINGING IN THE HERD FROM THE OTHER HALF-SECTION
WE'D ONLY GET IN DEEPER AND DEEPER YES YES CARL I KNOW
WILL YOU PLEASE PUT IT IN WITH YOUR THINGS AND TELL HIM IT'S FROM ME TO WEAR WHEN HE GOES SERENADING ALEXANDRA LAUGHED
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US CARL IF FATHER HAS TO DIE
THE NEXT IS ALMOST BARE
YES I SUPPOSE I MUST SEE THE OLD PLACE
BEFORE CARL OPENED IT HE DREW ALEXANDRA TO HIM AND KISSED HER SOFTLY ON HER LIPS AND ON HER EYES
AS HE LAY THERE DAY AFTER DAY HE HAD TO ACCEPT THE SITUATION AS IT WAS AND TO BE THANKFUL THAT THERE WAS ONE AMONG HIS CHILDREN TO WHOM HE COULD ENTRUST THE FUTURE OF HIS FAMILY AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF HIS HARD-WON LAND
I'M AWFULLY SORRY HE SAID IN A BRIGHT CLEAR VOICE WITH A RISING INFLECTION AS IF HE EXPECTED HER TO SAY SOMETHING
YOU OUGHT TO GO OUT AND SEE THAT HEADER WORK
SHE TOLD OLD BRUNOT THE MISER THAT HE WOULD LOSE ALL HIS MONEY MARRY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN AND LIVE HAPPILY ON A CRUST
I TA-ANK I SAVE UP SHE SAID WITH A GIGGLE
HE ALSO PLAYED THE CORNET IN THE UNIVERSITY BAND WHEN THE GRASS REQUIRED HIS CLOSE ATTENTION OR WHEN HE HAD TO STOOP TO CUT ABOUT A HEAD-STONE HE PAUSED IN HIS LIVELY AIR,--THE JEWEL SONG,--TAKING IT UP WHERE HE HAD LEFT IT WHEN HIS SCYTHE SWUNG FREE AGAIN
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO GRUB FOR EVERY DOLLAR YES I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
HER EYES LIT UP AS MARIE BENT DOWN AND OPENED THE OVEN DOOR
BUT FRANK SHOOK OFF HIS FRIENDLY HAND AND GRUNTED SHE TELL MY FORTUNE LONG AGO
ALEXANDRA FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE IN THE WAY HE CHILLED OFF AS IF SOMETHING CAME UP IN HIM THAT EXTINGUISHED HIS POWER OF FEELING OR THINKING
WHEN YOU GO OUT OF THE HOUSE INTO THE FLOWER GARDEN THERE YOU FEEL AGAIN THE ORDER AND FINE ARRANGEMENT MANIFEST ALL OVER THE GREAT FARM
O--RA PRO NO-O-BIS
FOR PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT IT WAS NON-EXISTENT
HE TURNED AWAY FROM ALEXANDRA
FOR THE AUTHORITY YOU CAN EXERT BY LAW IS THE ONLY INFLUENCE YOU WILL EVER HAVE OVER ME AGAIN ALEXANDRA ROSE
WE FOLLOWED THE PARADE OUT TO THE CIRCUS GROUNDS AND HUNG AROUND UNTIL THE SHOW BEGAN AND THE CROWD WENT INSIDE THE TENT
BUT FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS YOU WILL HAVE IT HARD AND YOU MUST ALL KEEP TOGETHER
I DON'T VERY OFTEN
SHE HAD BEGGED ALEXANDRA NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PLAN BEFORE OSCAR WHO WAS APT TO BE JEALOUS OF WHAT HIS SISTER DID FOR LOU'S CHILDREN
LIGHT WAS THE REALITY THE TREES WERE MERELY INTERFERENCES THAT REFLECTED AND REFRACTED LIGHT
AS THEY STOOD HOLDING THEIR HORSES BY THE BRIDLE THEY TALKED IN LOW TONES OF THEIR DEAD COMRADE
SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN HERE TEN YEARS NOW I HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN LONELY
IF I FIND ANYTHING GOOD YOU BOYS CAN GO DOWN AND MAKE A TRADE NOBODY DOWN THERE WILL TRADE FOR ANYTHING UP HERE SAID OSCAR GLOOMILY
THEY HAVE JUST COME BACK FROM THE BLUE
WAS SHE WAITING FOR HIM
PERHAPS HE WOULD TRY TO BE AGREEABLE TO PEOPLE AGAIN IF I WERE NOT AROUND
SHE COULD UNDERSTAND HIS BEHAVIOR MORE EASILY THAN SHE COULD UNDERSTAND MARIE'S
SOMETIMES AFTER SHE HAD BEEN IN THE OPEN ALL DAY OVERSEEING THE BRANDING OF THE CATTLE OR THE LOADING OF THE PIGS SHE WOULD COME IN CHILLED TAKE A CONCOCTION OF SPICES AND WARM HOME-MADE WINE AND GO TO BED WITH HER BODY ACTUALLY ACHING WITH FATIGUE
EVERYTHING REMINDED ME
WHEN ALEXANDRA ENTERED HER HOTEL THE CLERK HELD UP ONE FINGER AND BECKONED TO HER
SHE WOULD NOT AT LEAST LIVE IN PERPETUAL FEAR
IL Y A ICI UNE VERITABLE CLAIRVOYANTE MARIE WAS CLEVER AT FORTUNE-TELLING INDULGING IN A LIGHT IRONY THAT AMUSED THE CROWD
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT SHE CAN DO WITH HER POKER
YOU OWE ME A VISIT FOR THE SAKE OF OLD TIMES
IT'S AWFULLY EASY TO RUSH INTO A PROFESSION YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE AND AWFULLY HARD TO GET OUT OF IT
WOULD NEVER FIND IT IF HE LIVED BESIDE IT A THOUSAND YEARS
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO TRY AN EASIER WAY
IF YOU HAD ANY EYES YOU WOULD SEE THAT SHE IS VERY FOND OF HIM
YOU HAVE BEEN WITH ME NOW FOR TWELVE YEARS AND I HAVE GONE TO YOU FOR ADVICE OFTENER THAN I HAVE EVER GONE TO ANY ONE
SURE ENOUGH WE WERE LOOKING FOR PATTERNS WEREN'T WE
HE LIES AND COUNTS ON HIS FINGERS ALL DAY
HE SAYS HE'S LIKELY TO SET FIRE TO THE BARN ANY NIGHT OR TO TAKE AFTER YOU AND THE GIRLS WITH AN AXE LITTLE SIGNA WHO WAS WAITING ON THE TABLE GIGGLED AND FLED TO THE KITCHEN
HIRE A MAN WHEN YOU NEED HELP
THE WEATHER HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO WITH THEIR SEEING LESS OF EACH OTHER THAN USUAL
ALEXANDRA HELD OUT HER HAND
IT WAS ALREADY BLEACHED TO A CHALKY GRAY
HER OWN CASE WAS CLEAR
IT GAVE THE LITTLE CLOTHING DRUMMER SUCH A START THAT HE ACTUALLY LET HIS CIGAR FALL TO THE SIDEWALK AND WENT OFF WEAKLY IN THE TEETH OF THE WIND TO THE SALOON
THAT EVENING SHE HELD A FAMILY COUNCIL AND TOLD HER BROTHERS ALL THAT SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD
WHEN THE KITCHEN CLOCK STRUCK SIX SHE WENT OUT TO GET SUPPER CLOSING THE DOOR GENTLY BEHIND HER
AND AS FOR MY FEET I HAVE OBSERVED YOUR WISHES ALL THESE YEARS THOUGH YOU HAVE NEVER QUESTIONED ME
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE DONE MUCH FOR HIMSELF
SEE DIS TREAD
SO MANY OF OUR OLD NEIGHBORS ALEXANDRA PAUSED AND LOOKED UP THOUGHTFULLY AT THE STARS
SHE WAS A DARK CHILD WITH BROWN CURLY HAIR LIKE A BRUNETTE DOLL'S A COAXING LITTLE RED MOUTH AND ROUND YELLOW-BROWN EYES
WHEN ONE MAKES A MISTAKE THERE'S NO TELLING WHERE IT WILL STOP
BUT AT PRESENT I NEED YOU HERE
ALEXANDRA STAYED IN THE HOUSE
BUT OFF THERE IN THE CITIES THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ROLLING STONES LIKE ME
I WON'T WASTE ANOTHER WEEK
NELSE WATCHES HER GLUMLY AS SHE WAITS UPON THE TABLE AND IN THE EVENING HE SITS ON A BENCH BEHIND THE STOVE WITH HIS DRAGHARMONIKA PLAYING MOURNFUL AIRS AND WATCHING HER AS SHE GOES ABOUT HER WORK
ALL THE GIRLS WERE A LITTLE AFRAID OF HIM
THEY TELEPHONED EACH OTHER ALMOST EVERY NIGHT THOUGH IN JANUARY THERE WAS A STRETCH OF THREE WEEKS WHEN THE WIRES WERE DOWN AND WHEN THE POSTMAN DID NOT COME AT ALL
ISN'T EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL AFTER THE RAIN
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAYS
ON WEDNESDAY MORNING CARL GOT UP BEFORE IT WAS LIGHT AND STOLE DOWNSTAIRS AND OUT OF THE KITCHEN DOOR JUST AS OLD IVAR WAS MAKING HIS MORNING ABLUTIONS AT THE PUMP
HE WANTS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF HE DOES WELL SUPPOSE I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF HIM
EVERYBODY KNOWS HE'S NEARLY FIVE YEARS YOUNGER THAN YOU AND IS AFTER YOUR MONEY
ASK HIM ALEXANDRA IF IT IS TRUE THAT A SEA GULL CAME HERE ONCE
YOU'LL BE FINDING SOME DISEASE ON THEM
WHEN IVAR DROVE UP TO THE GATE EMIL AND MARIE SHABATA BEGAN TO CARRY OUT THE PRESENTS AND ALEXANDRA WENT INTO HER BEDROOM TO BID SIGNA GOOD-BYE AND TO GIVE HER A FEW WORDS OF GOOD COUNSEL
WHEN ONE OF US DIES THEY SCARCELY KNOW WHERE TO BURY HIM
SHE WALKED SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE ORCHARD WHERE THE EVENING AIR WAS HEAVY WITH THE SMELL OF WILD COTTON
AND HOW GLAD SHE OUGHT TO BE SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT HE WAS ASLEEP
SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING HURT THAT EMIL HAD NOT COME TO TELL HER ABOUT AMEDEE
ALEXANDRA WATCHED THE SHIMMERING POOL DREAMILY BUT EVENTUALLY HER EYES WENT BACK TO THE SORGHUM PATCH SOUTH OF THE BARN WHERE SHE WAS PLANNING TO MAKE HER NEW PIG CORRAL
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT FOR YEARS IT REALLY IS A CANE THEN YES
YES EMIL TOLD ME ABOUT MR LINSTRUM BEING HERE
HE COULD REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW SHE LOOKED WHEN SHE CAME OVER THE CLOSE-CROPPED GRASS HER SKIRTS PINNED UP HER HEAD BARE A BRIGHT TIN PAIL IN EITHER HAND AND THE MILKY LIGHT OF THE EARLY MORNING ALL ABOUT HER
I AM ON MY WAY TO THE COAST THEY STARTED UP THE PATH
EMIL BEGAN UNLACING HIS LEGGINGS
EVERYBODY OUGHT TO DO WHAT THEY CAN TO HELP ALONG AND WE HAVE NEVER DONE MUCH
THEY'VE BEEN SORE AT ME EVER SINCE YOU LET ME GO AWAY TO COLLEGE
AND IN THE LONG GRASS BY THE FENCE THE LAST WILD ROSES OF THE YEAR OPENED THEIR PINK HEARTS TO DIE
IF I HAVE THAT YOUNG FELLER IN DE HAYFIELD ONCE I SHOW HIM SOMETING
I'M SORRY IF I'VE SCARED YOU ALL
YES INDEED
MY GIRLS ARE AFRAID AS DEATH OF HIM AREN'T YOU MILLY DEAR MILLY WAS FIFTEEN FAT AND JOLLY AND POMPADOURED WITH A CREAMY COMPLEXION SQUARE WHITE TEETH AND A SHORT UPPER LIP
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG IT'S THE MEN THAT ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE YES OF COURSE LOU BROKE IN
IT MADE HIM SOMEHOW UNREASONABLY MOURNFUL TO FIND TWO YOUNG THINGS ABROAD IN THE PASTURE IN THE EARLY MORNING
THE GROUND IS FROZEN SO HARD THAT IT BRUISES THE FOOT TO WALK IN THE ROADS OR IN THE PLOUGHED FIELDS
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET SOME OTHER LITTLE BOY TO PLAY WITH HE STOPPED AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH
ALEXANDRA WAS SITTING ON ONE OF THE WOODEN CHAIRS HER ARMS RESTING ON THE TABLE
HE TOLD ABOUT BULL-FIGHTS AND COCK-FIGHTS CHURCHES AND FIESTAS THE FLOWER-MARKETS AND THE FOUNTAINS THE MUSIC AND DANCING THE PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS HE MET IN THE ITALIAN RESTAURANTS ON SAN FRANCISCO STREET
HE HAS OFFERED TO BREAK ME IN TURRIBLE COLD WINTERS THERE I HEAR REMARKED OSCAR
WE CAN'T EVEN TRY
BUT THERE WAS A CRANE LAST WEEK
HE KNEW THAT HE HAD MURDERED SOMEBODY THAT A WOMAN WAS BLEEDING AND MOANING IN THE ORCHARD BUT HE HAD NOT REALIZED BEFORE THAT IT WAS HIS WIFE
THEY HAD REACHED THE GATE
I TOLD HIM TO COME AT ANY TIME LOU SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
SHE WILL THINK I HAVE FORSAKEN HER NOW THAT MY OLD FRIEND HAS COME BACK AFTER THE MEN HAD GONE BACK TO WORK ALEXANDRA PUT ON A WHITE DRESS AND HER SUN-HAT AND SHE AND CARL SET FORTH ACROSS THE FIELDS
HE SLIPPED OUT UNDER COVER OF THE HOLY CITY FOLLOWED BY MALVINA'S WISTFUL EYE AND WENT TO THE STABLE FOR HIS MARE
THERE ARE A LOT OF ODDS AND ENDS IN THEM SHE BEGAN TOSSING OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE DRAWERS AND ALEXANDRA WENT INTO THE CLOTHES-CLOSET
THINK OF THAT
WE'RE IN SO DEEP NOW WE MIGHT AS WELL GO DEEPER
BUT THERE'S A FEW CHUNKS OF YOUR OLD SOD HOUSE LEFT
THE OLD MAN WAS THROWN INTO A FRIGHT AT ONCE
ABOUT LIKE THE GERMANS WASN'T IT MARIE WENT ON AS IF SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM
HE UNDERSTANDS ANIMALS
YOU WON'T KNOW HIM
THEY HAVE THEIR ROADS UP THERE AS WE HAVE DOWN HERE EMIL RUBBED HIS KNEES THOUGHTFULLY
HOO HOO-O-O-O HE CALLED BACK AS HE DISAPPEARED OVER A RIDGE AND DROPPED INTO A SAND GULLY
YOU OUGHT TO REMEMBER THAT LOU FOR YOU WERE MARRIED JUST AFTER WE WENT AWAY GOING TO STAY WITH US SOME TIME OSCAR ASKED
HE MANAGED TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH MARIE BEFORE SHE WENT AWAY AND WHEREAS HE HAD BEEN ONLY HALF IN LOVE WITH HER BEFORE HE NOW PERSUADED HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT STOP AT ANYTHING
OH YOU KNOW ANNIE SHE LOOKED AT THE YOUNG MAN'S BARE ARMS
I HAVE HAD NOBODY BUT IVAR AND SIGNA TO TALK TO
THE BERGSONS HAD A LOG HOUSE FOR INSTANCE ONLY BECAUSE MRS BERGSON WOULD NOT LIVE IN A SOD HOUSE
THE NEXT MORNING THEY WERE SILENT AND RESERVED
OUCH
HE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING WHILE HE WAS FIRING
MOST OF THE LAND IS ROUGH AND HILLY
IN MY OPINION IVAR HAS JUST AS MUCH RIGHT TO HIS OWN WAY OF DRESSING AND THINKING AS WE HAVE
IF I'D CONSENTED YOU'D HAVE GONE DOWN TO THE RIVER AND SCRAPED ALONG ON POOR FARMS FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES
HE HAD TRIED TO MAKE HER LIFE UGLY
A GOOD MANY ARE DOING THAT HERE NOW
CARL HAD TO GO TO THE VERY TOP OF THE POLE AND THEN HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN TEARING HER FROM HER HOLD
SHE BEGAN TO SHUFFLE HER CARDS FURIOUSLY
HE WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD
LOU LOOKED AT THE CARPET
IN IT WAS ROLLED A BUFFALO ROBE
THERE WAS A DELICATE PALLOR IN HIS THIN FACE AND HIS MOUTH WAS TOO SENSITIVE FOR A BOY'S
I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HIM PASS THE PRESERVES LOU SAID ANNIE IN A WARNING TONE
HER FACE WAS SO RADIANT THAT HE FELT SHY ABOUT ASKING HER
ARE THE PICTURES COLORED
WHEN SHE WENT OUT INTO THE DARK KITCHEN TO FIX HER PLANTS FOR THE NIGHT SHE USED TO STAND BY THE WINDOW AND LOOK OUT AT THE WHITE FIELDS OR WATCH THE CURRENTS OF SNOW WHIRLING OVER THE ORCHARD
SHE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER SHE WOULD NOT DO BETTER TO FINISH HER LIFE ALONE
MY A-AN'T YOU GOTTA FINE PLANTS
THANK YOU I'LL TRY THERE SAID ALEXANDRA LINGERINGLY
DO BRING IT OVER CARL
SHE CALLED HIM BY AN OLD SWEDISH NAME THAT SHE USED TO CALL HIM WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE AND TOOK HIS DINNER TO HIM IN THE SHIPYARD
I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SEE IT AND I'M SURE IT WILL PLEASE FATHER
BUT WHETHER HE WAS ON THE FLOOR OR BROODING IN A CORNER HE WAS ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT MARIE SHABATA
ON THE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF ONE OF THE STORES SAT A LITTLE SWEDE BOY CRYING BITTERLY
THEY TELEPHONED FROM SAINTE-AGNES THAT AMEDEE DIED AT THREE O'CLOCK THIS MORNING VI THE CHURCH HAS ALWAYS HELD THAT LIFE IS FOR THE LIVING
WHEN HE SPOKE TO CARL HE SHOWED A FINE SET OF WHITE TEETH
WHY SHOULD HE
OUT OF HER FATHER'S CHILDREN THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS FIT TO COPE WITH THE WORLD WHO HAD NOT BEEN TIED TO THE PLOW AND WHO HAD A PERSONALITY APART FROM THE SOIL
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT MRS LEE'S APRON
AS THEY DROVE ALONG SHE AND EMIL TALKED AND PLANNED
YOU ARE ABLE TO DO MUCH BETTER THINGS
BECAUSE I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM SHE SAID FIRMLY
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING YOU'LL LIKE AND BE PROUD OF
I WOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU ANYWHERE ALEXANDRA SHADED HER EYES WITH HER HAND
HE KNEW EVERY RIDGE AND DRAW AND GULLY BETWEEN HIM AND THE HORIZON
I GAVE OLD MAN LEE A CUT OR SO TOO
I HOPE HE WILL GET ON WELL HERE
AFTER THAT DAY THE YOUNGER WOMAN SEEMED TO SHRINK MORE AND MORE INTO HERSELF
SHE DOES THE BEST SHE CAN ALEXANDRA LOOKED AT THE EXCITED MAN AND OFFERED A SUGGESTION
AND WHY WITH HER HAPPY AFFECTIONATE NATURE SHOULD SHE HAVE BROUGHT DESTRUCTION AND SORROW TO ALL WHO HAD LOVED HER EVEN TO POOR OLD JOE TOVESKY THE UNCLE WHO USED TO CARRY HER ABOUT SO PROUDLY WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL
THE HEDGEROWS AND TREES ARE SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AGAINST THE BARE EARTH WHOSE SLATY HUE THEY HAVE TAKEN ON
YOU FEEL IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE SAME TONIC PUISSANT QUALITY THAT IS IN THE TILTH THE SAME STRENGTH AND RESOLUTENESS
SHE TOOK UP ONE OF THE BIRDS A RUMPLED BALL OF FEATHERS WITH THE BLOOD DRIPPING SLOWLY FROM ITS MOUTH AND LOOKED AT THE LIVE COLOR THAT STILL BURNED ON ITS PLUMAGE
YOU MUST FEEL WHEN PEOPLE ADMIRE YOU ALEXANDRA BLUSHED AND LAUGHED WITH SOME CONFUSION
AND YOU WILL VISIT AN OLD LADY WITH A WHITE CAP AND GOLD HOOPS IN HER EARS AND YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY THERE MAIS OUI SAID THE PRIEST WITH A MELANCHOLY SMILE
HE COULD WORK AS GOOD AS ANY MAN AND HIS HEAD WAS CLEAR BUT THEY LOCKED HIM UP FOR BEING DIFFERENT IN HIS STOMACH
NOW WAIT UNTIL I FIND MY BOX
I AM GOING TO DRIVE UP TO THE NORTH QUARTER TO MEET THE MAN FROM TOWN WHO IS TO BUY MY ALFALFA HAY III ALEXANDRA WAS TO HEAR MORE OF IVAR'S CASE HOWEVER
THOSE TWO WILL GET ON SAID ALEXANDRA AS THEY TURNED BACK TO THE HOUSE
I'LL HAVE TO SEND IT BY MAIL NOW TO GET IT THERE IN TIME MARIE PULLED A DARK PURPLE SILK NECKTIE FROM HER WORKBASKET
BEFORE IVAR REACHED THE GRAVEYARD THREE MILES FROM THE HOUSE THE STORM HAD SPENT ITSELF AND THE DOWNPOUR HAD DIED INTO A SOFT DRIPPING RAIN
THERE SEEMED TO BE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO GO AND THEY WALKED OUT
NOT A SHED NOT A CORRAL NOT A WELL NOT EVEN A PATH BROKEN IN THE CURLY GRASS
I CAN FEEL HIM
WHEN HE SAW HER COMING HE STOPPED AND WIPED HIS BROW
I HAVE A FEELING THAT IF YOU GO AWAY YOU WILL NOT COME BACK
IVAR'S BANDY LEGS SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN SHORTER WITH YEARS AND THEY WERE COMPLETELY MISFITTED TO HIS BROAD THICK BODY AND HEAVY SHOULDERS
DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDRA I COULD PICK OUT EXACTLY THE RIGHT SORT OF WOMAN FOR FRANK--NOW
MAYBE HE CAN DO SOMETHING
LOOK AT THE SPIDER-WEBS ALL OVER THE GRASS
ONCE WHEN MRS BERGSON ON HER WAY TO NORWAY CREEK STOPPED TO SEE OLD MRS LEE THE OLD WOMAN HID IN THE HAYMOW FOR FEAR MIS BERGSON WOULD CATCH HER BAREFOOT III ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN JULY SIX MONTHS AFTER JOHN BERGSON'S DEATH CARL WAS SITTING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE LINSTRUM KITCHEN DREAMING OVER AN ILLUSTRATED PAPER WHEN HE HEARD THE RATTLE OF A WAGON ALONG THE HILL ROAD
AND IS THAT TRUE IVAR ABOUT THE HEAD DUCKS FALLING BACK WHEN THEY ARE TIRED AND THE HIND ONES TAKING THEIR PLACE YES
UP TO THE TIME CARL WENT AWAY THEY HADN'T BORNE AT ALL AND NOW HE'S COME BACK TO EAT THEM CRIED MARIE NODDING AT CARL
ABOVE MARIE AND EMIL TWO WHITE BUTTERFLIES FROM FRANK'S ALFALFA-FIELD WERE FLUTTERING IN AND OUT AMONG THE INTERLACING SHADOWS
SHE CAME OUT HERE A BRIDE WITH HER FATHER AND HUSBAND
FRANK SHE SAID HER EYES FILLING SUDDENLY I HOPE YOU'LL LET ME BE FRIENDLY WITH YOU
OH NEVER MIND ABOUT YOUR FEET IVAR
IN SHORT THEY WERE THE KIND OF LETTERS A YOUNG MAN WRITES TO A WOMAN WHEN HE WISHES HIMSELF AND HIS LIFE TO SEEM INTERESTING TO HER WHEN HE WISHES TO ENLIST HER IMAGINATION IN HIS BEHALF
IT WAS A NIGHT OF WARM WIND AND FAINT STARLIGHT AND THE FIREFLIES WERE GLIMMERING OVER THE WHEAT
SHE HAD ADMIRED HIM ABANDONEDLY
HE WOULDN'T HURT YOU EMIL SAID CARL PERSUASIVELY
FOR THREE YEARS HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO BREAK HER SPIRIT
EMIL HAD MORE FRIENDS UP HERE IN THE FRENCH COUNTRY THAN DOWN ON NORWAY CREEK
MILLY HAS IT VERY DIFFERENT
EVEN AS A GIRL SHE HAD LOOKED UPON MEN AS WORK-FELLOWS
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE FRANK HAD HAD AN EXCITING DAY
VIII WHEN OLD IVAR CLIMBED DOWN FROM HIS LOFT AT FOUR O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING HE CAME UPON EMIL'S MARE JADED AND LATHER-STAINED HER BRIDLE BROKEN CHEWING THE SCATTERED TUFTS OF HAY OUTSIDE THE STABLE DOOR
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
SKIN WITH THE FRESHNESS OF THE SNOW ITSELF
EMIL TOO IS GOING AWAY CARL WAS STILL STUDYING JOHN BERGSON'S FACE AND ALEXANDRA'S EYES FOLLOWED HIS
BUT MOTHER FRETS IF THE WOOD GETS LOW SHE STOPPED AND PUT HER HAND TO HER FOREHEAD BRUSHING BACK HER HAIR
UNDER THE LONG SHAGGY RIDGES SHE FELT THE FUTURE STIRRING
EMIL HAD ALREADY BEGUN WORK AND WAS MOWING VIGOROUSLY
I TELL ALL THE FRENCH GIRLS TO KEEP WAY FROM YOU
HIS EYES FILLED SLOWLY WITH TEARS
TIRED EMIL HIS SISTER ASKED
HER WILL FWEEZE AT THE TOP OF THE POLE CROUCHED A SHIVERING GRAY KITTEN MEWING FAINTLY AND CLINGING DESPERATELY TO THE WOOD WITH HER CLAWS
SHE FELT NO ANXIETY ABOUT EMIL
THE SUNLIGHT FLASHING ON THE WINDOW-GLASS OF THE BIG RED BARNS DROVE HIM WILD WITH JOY
ARE YOU REALLY LIKE THAT PERHAPS I AM
ALEXANDRA ROSE AND TOOK HIM BY THE HAND
WHEN HE CAME BACK DANGLING THE DUCKS BY THEIR FEET MARIE HELD HER APRON AND HE DROPPED THEM INTO IT
TRY TO BREAK A LITTLE MORE LAND EVERY YEAR
I'D RATHER HAVE HAD YOUR FREEDOM THAN MY LAND CARL SHOOK HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY
HER BREAST ROSE AND FELL FAINTLY AS IF SHE WERE ASLEEP
WHEN IT WAS OVER THE CONGREGATION THRONGED ABOUT THE NEWLY CONFIRMED
BUT IF YOU DON'T I HAVE A COFFEE-CAKE WITH NUTS AND POPPY SEEDS
WHICH WAS HIS WAY OF SAYING THAT SHE WAS INTELLIGENT
ALL THE SAME I HOPE IT HASN'T BEEN QUITE THE SAME ALEXANDRA LOOKED AT HIM WITH SURPRISE
SEEMS TO ME IT GETS WORSE AS IT GOES ON
THERE IS SOMETHING FRANK AND JOYOUS AND YOUNG IN THE OPEN FACE OF THE COUNTRY
CARL AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT BEFORE HE WENT AWAY I REMEMBER AND EMIL HAD HIS KITTEN ALONG
CARL CAME IN WEARING HIS OVERCOAT AND CARRYING A WOODEN BOX WITH A BRASS HANDLE
ALEXANDRA TURNED AWAY DECIDEDLY
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR MILLY
OH I WISH I LIVED WHERE PEOPLE WORE THINGS LIKE THAT
SHE WAS GOING OVER TO THE OTHER OCEAN MAYBE AND DID NOT KNOW HOW FAR IT WAS
YOU SEE MY DEAR I HAPPEN TO HAVE AN HONEST PARTNER
AS THEY DROVE THROUGH THE ROLLING FRENCH COUNTRY TOWARD THE WESTERING SUN AND THE STALWART CHURCH SHE WAS THINKING OF THAT TIME LONG AGO WHEN SHE AND EMIL DROVE BACK FROM THE RIVER VALLEY TO THE STILL UNCONQUERED DIVIDE
CARL CAME QUIETLY AND SLOWLY UP THE GARDEN PATH LOOKING INTENTLY AT ALEXANDRA
THE OLD PEOPLE IN THE MOUNTAINS PLANT LINDENS TO PURIFY THE FOREST AND TO DO AWAY WITH THE SPELLS THAT COME FROM THE OLD TREES THEY SAY HAVE LASTED FROM HEATHEN TIMES
WHERE'S YOUR COMFORTER
WHEN HIS SISTER CAME OUT HE LOOKED UP NOT KNOWING WHETHER THE INTERVAL HAD BEEN SHORT OR LONG AND HE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THE ROOM HAD GROWN QUITE DARK
CAN'T YOU SEE HE'S JUST A TRAMP AND HE'S AFTER YOUR MONEY
FRANK WOULD BE ALL RIGHT IN THE RIGHT PLACE SHE SAID REFLECTIVELY
EVERY CLUMP OF IRONWEED AND SNOW-ON-THE-MOUNTAIN THREW A LONG SHADOW AND THE GOLDEN LIGHT SEEMED TO BE RIPPLING THROUGH THE CURLY GRASS LIKE THE TIDE RACING IN
ALEXANDRA NODDED TO HER ENCOURAGINGLY
LEANING OVER THE TABLE HE DROPPED THEM INTO HER LAP
THEN SHE MET FRANK SHABATA IN THE UNION STATION IN ST LOUIS AND RAN AWAY WITH HIM
SOME DAY THE LAND ITSELF WILL BE WORTH MORE THAN ALL WE CAN EVER RAISE ON IT LOU LAUGHED
YOU SEE HE WENT ON CALMLY MEASURED BY YOUR STANDARDS HERE I'M A FAILURE
AND EVER SINCE HE HAD BEEN ON THE WAY
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING SHE RAN AWAY AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE LOW-GROWING APPLE TREES
HE DISLIKED THE LITTER OF HUMAN DWELLINGS
CARL'S SENSITIVE LOWER LIP TREMBLED
I GET TIRED OF SEEING MEN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN MARIE LOOKED UP AT HIS DEFIANT FIGURE AND HER FACE CLOUDED
HE KEPT ALL THESE TREES ALIVE FOR YEARS WATERING THEM WITH HIS OWN BACK MARIE TURNED TO CARL
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW ALL THE BOHEMIANS CROWDED ROUND HER IN THE STORE THAT DAY WHEN SHE GAVE EMIL HER CANDY
HAVEN'T I SEEN HIS MOTHER OUT IN THE MORNING AT FIVE O'CLOCK WITH HER LADLE AND HER BIG BUCKET ON WHEELS PUTTING LIQUID MANURE ON THE CABBAGES
LOU LOOKED AFTER THEM HELPLESSLY
THE HANDS THE TONGUE THE EYES THE HEART ALL THE BODILY DESIRES WE ARE COMMANDED TO SUBDUE
ALEXANDRA IS THE OLDEST AND SHE KNOWS MY WISHES
I NOT CARE A DAMN HE STOPPED AND RUBBED THE PALM OF HIS HAND OVER THE LIGHT BRISTLES ON HIS HEAD WITH ANNOYANCE
I HOPE THAT HE IS AMONG THE OLD PEOPLE OF HIS BLOOD AND COUNTRY AND THAT TIDINGS DO NOT REACH HIM FROM THE NEW WORLD PART III
WE'VE SOMEWAY ALWAYS FELT ALIKE ABOUT THINGS YES THAT'S IT
HE SAYS IN ONE LETTER THAT THE MEXICAN LADIES ARE SAID TO BE VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT DON'T SEEM TO ME VERY WARM PRAISE MARIE TOSSED HER HEAD
I'M AFRAID THAT HURT HER FEELINGS
I SAY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH WHILE WOULDN'T IT
HE HAD NO LOVE FOR LOU WHO WAS ALWAYS UPPISH WITH HIM AND WHO SAID THAT ALEXANDRA PAID HER HANDS TOO MUCH
THE KITTEN WOULD NOT BUDGE AN INCH
NO NO
IVAR HIRED HIMSELF OUT IN THRESHING AND CORN-HUSKING TIME AND HE DOCTORED SICK ANIMALS WHEN HE WAS SENT FOR
SHE WAS NEVER VERY COMMUNICATIVE ABOUT HER OWN AFFAIRS AND WHEN SHE CAME TO THE POINT AN INSTINCT TOLD HER THAT ABOUT SUCH THINGS SHE AND MARIE WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
I'D SING TO THEM EVERY NIGHT WOULDN'T YOU MRS LEE THE OLD LADY CHUCKLED
THE WIND WAKENED ME
NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF SHE DIDN'T GET IT THERE
DIDN'T IT BLOW DREADFULLY
THEY HAD NOT SEEN HIM AT ALL
WHAT MAKES YOU SO FLIGHTY AM I FLIGHTY
SHE'LL ALWAYS MAKE A PARTY IF YOU GIVE HER THE LEAST EXCUSE
THE CATTLE LOWED AND BELLOWED
THOUGH SHE WAS BENT ALMOST DOUBLE SHE WAS AS SPRY AS A GOPHER
I BROUGHT HIM CUPS AND SPOONS AND BLANKETS AND MOCCASINS ENOUGH FOR AN ORPHAN ASYLUM
SO I'M GOING TO TRY THE GOLDFIELDS ALEXANDRA FELT THAT THIS WAS A TACTFUL SPEECH AND LOU LOOKED UP WITH SOME INTEREST
YOU ARE ALL I HAVE IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW CARL PRESSED HER HAND IN SILENCE
WHEN I WAS IN HASTINGS TO ATTEND THE CONVENTION HE WAS SAYING I SAW THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE ASYLUM AND I WAS TELLING HIM ABOUT IVAR'S SYMPTOMS
PERHAPS YOU WILL WANT TO GO WITH ME THEN
WHEN THEY GOT HOME SIGNA HAD A FIRE BURNING IN THE SITTING-ROOM STOVE
ON SATURDAY WHILE HALF THE VILLAGE OF SAINTE-AGNES WAS MOURNING FOR AMEDEE AND PREPARING THE FUNERAL BLACK FOR HIS BURIAL ON MONDAY THE OTHER HALF WAS BUSY WITH WHITE DRESSES AND WHITE VEILS FOR THE GREAT CONFIRMATION SERVICE TO-MORROW WHEN THE BISHOP WAS TO CONFIRM A CLASS OF ONE HUNDRED BOYS AND GIRLS
THE NICER THE PLACE WAS THE MORE I WANTED YOU THEY HAD COME TO THE STILE AND EMIL POINTED TO IT PERSUASIVELY
SHE WAS LIVING
I HAVE TALKED TO HER SINCE I HAVE BEEN SICK AND SHE KNOWS ALL MY WISHES
HE DID NOT NOTICE THE SADNESS OF HER TONE
SIT DOWN LIKE A GOOD GIRL MARIE AND DON'T RUIN MY POOR HAT AND I'LL TELL YOU A STORY
SHE FOUND MORE COMFORT IN THE CHURCH THAT WINTER THAN EVER BEFORE
BUT WHEN I GOT YOUR TELEGRAM YESTERDAY THEN--THEN IT WAS JUST AS IT USED TO BE
BUT HE WROTE A GREAT MANY LETTERS BACK TO THE OLD COUNTRY
MEDEE IS OUT IN THE FIELD EMIL ANGELIQUE CALLED AS SHE RAN ACROSS THE KITCHEN TO THE OVEN
I OFTEN THINK OF HER
EVEN BEFORE THE MASS BEGAN THE AIR WAS CHARGED WITH FEELING
ALEXANDRA I IVAR WAS SITTING AT A COBBLER'S BENCH IN THE BARN MENDING HARNESS BY THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN AND REPEATING TO HIMSELF THE 101ST PSALM
EMIL I WENT TO YOUR ROOM AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT BUT YOU WERE SLEEPING SO SOUND I HATED TO WAKE YOU
IT'S ALL HARDER ON THEM THAN IT IS ON ME
HE THREW HIS HANDS OVER HIS HEAD
I THINK WHEN FRIENDS MARRY THEY ARE SAFE
EVERYBODY LIKES HER JUST THE SAME AS WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE
WAS THERE THEN SOMETHING WRONG IN BEING WARM-HEARTED AND IMPULSIVE LIKE THAT
LOU IS GOING INTO BUSINESS LOU GRINNED
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT WHEN YOU CAME BACK
THE LIGHT FELL UPON THE TWO SAD YOUNG FACES THAT WERE TURNED MUTELY TOWARD IT
AFTER THEY REACHED HOME ALEXANDRA HAD GONE OVER TO MRS HILLER'S TO LEAVE A LITTLE PRESENT SHE HAD BOUGHT FOR HER IN THE CITY
AND SHE MADE A STICKY DARK CONSERVE OF GARDEN TOMATOES
I AM NOT THAT KIND OF A GIRL AND YOU KNOW IT
YOU AREN'T FIT TO BE OUT OF SCHOOL AND THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
GOOD-BYE MARIE
I'M ANGRY WITH YOU EMIL SHE BROKE OUT WITH PETULANCE
I GO TO TAKE DAT OLD WOMAN TO DE COURT IF SHE AIN'T CAREFUL I TELL YOU HIS WIFE SPOKE SOOTHINGLY
HIS IDEAS ABOUT THE FUTURE WOULD NOT CRYSTALLIZE
FRANK WAS STILL STARING AT HER BUT HE SEEMED TO SEE NOTHING
YOU HAVE BEEN A GOOD FRIEND TO THE MISTRESS IVAR SHE MURMURED
HER FACE TOO WAS RATHER LIKE A POPPY ROUND AND BROWN WITH RICH COLOR IN HER CHEEKS AND LIPS AND HER DANCING YELLOW-BROWN EYES BUBBLED WITH GAYETY
OH YES
SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT CROSS-STITCH WHILE ALEXANDRA REMOVED HER HAT AND VEIL MRS LEE WENT OUT TO THE KITCHEN AND SETTLED HERSELF IN A WOODEN ROCKING-CHAIR BY THE STOVE LOOKING WITH GREAT INTEREST AT THE TABLE SET FOR THREE WITH A WHITE CLOTH AND A POT OF PINK GERANIUMS IN THE MIDDLE
I EXPECT OLD MRS LEE WOULD LOVE TO SLIP HER SHOES OFF NOW SOMETIMES IF SHE DARED
MARIE HID HER FACE ON HIS ARM
MARIE WAS INCAPABLE OF BEING LUKEWARM ABOUT ANYTHING THAT PLEASED HER
ALEXANDRA HE SAID AS HE APPROACHED HER I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
THE HIGH NARROW RED-BRICK BUILDING WITH ITS TALL STEEPLE AND STEEP ROOF COULD BE SEEN FOR MILES ACROSS THE WHEATFIELDS THOUGH THE LITTLE TOWN OF SAINTE-AGNES WAS COMPLETELY HIDDEN AWAY AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL
A THIRD OF THE PLACE BELONGS TO YOU BY AMERICAN LAW AND WE CAN'T SELL WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT
IT SORT OF MAKES PEOPLE DISTANT WITH YOU WHEN THEY NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY'LL HEAR HIM SCRATCHING ABOUT
THAT WOULD BE A WASTE OF POWDER
MARIA RAN UP PANTING AND THREW HER ARMS ABOUT ALEXANDRA
TO BE SURE IF THE THING DON'T WORK WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF FEED WITHOUT IT INDEED BARNEY CONCEDED
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
FRANK LOOKED UP SUDDENLY AND STARED OUT OF THE OFFICE WINDOW
WHEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE KITCHEN THE SNOW HAD BEGUN TO FALL AND MARIE'S VISITORS THOUGHT THEY MUST BE GETTING HOME
AS SHE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR TOWARD HER ROOM SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE WAS IN A MANNER IMMUNE FROM EVIL TIDINGS
PERHAPS HE WISHED HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT FOR HER HE WAS AS GOOD AS GONE ALREADY
INDEED THEY DID NOT OPENLY LOOK IN HIS DIRECTION
YOU'D JUST AS SOON KILL US ALL ALEXANDRA TO CARRY OUT SOME SCHEME OSCAR RUBBED HIS HIGH PALE FOREHEAD
THE HENS WERE CLUCKING AND SCRATCHING BROWN HOLES IN THE FLOWER BEDS AND THE WIND WAS TEASING THE PRINCE'S FEATHER BY THE DOOR
I'M ABSOLUTELY SICK OF IT ALL CARL FROWNED
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT
SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM AS SHE ADJUSTED THE SHADE
THE COLD WAS BITTER ENOUGH ON THE GROUND
ALEXANDRA LOOKED AFTER HIM WISTFULLY
WHO THE MISTRESS YES
HE WAS LIKE AN ARROW SHOT FROM THE BOW
IT'S THE GREATEST THING EVER
CARL'S A SENSIBLE FELLOW
AND EMIL WHO HAD SO OFTEN IMAGINED THE SHOCK OF THIS FIRST KISS WAS SURPRISED AT ITS GENTLENESS AND NATURALNESS
SHE TOOK UP THE PACKAGE OF LETTERS ALEXANDRA HAD BROUGHT BUT SHE DID NOT READ THEM
LIKE MOST OF THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY WERE MEANT TO FOLLOW IN PATHS ALREADY MARKED OUT FOR THEM NOT TO BREAK TRAILS IN A NEW COUNTRY
THE HISTORY OF EVERY COUNTRY BEGINS IN THE HEART OF A MAN OR A WOMAN
LISTEN LOU
LOTS OF THE BOHEMIAN BOYS AT THE UNIVERSITY ARE SAID EMIL TAKING UP HIS SCYTHE AGAIN
EMIL FOLLOWED WITH LONG STRIDES UNTIL HE OVERTOOK HER
WHOEVER HEARD OF HIM TALKING SENSE ANYHOW
I SAY ANGELIQUE ONE OF MEDEE'S GRANDMOTHERS WAY BACK MUST HAVE BEEN A SQUAW
WE ONLY WANT YOU TO ADVISE US
WE HAVEN'T ENOUGH TO SHIP
THE SQUARE HEAD AND HEAVY SHOULDERS BELONGED TO OSCAR THE ELDER
SOUTH OF THE HILL IN A LOW SHELTERED SWALE SURROUNDED BY A MULBERRY HEDGE WAS THE ORCHARD ITS FRUIT TREES KNEE-DEEP IN TIMOTHY GRASS
THE HEART WHEN IT IS TOO MUCH ALIVE ACHES FOR THAT BROWN EARTH AND ECSTASY HAS NO FEAR OF DEATH
THESE FAMILY DISCUSSIONS ALWAYS DEPRESSED HER AND MADE HER REMEMBER ALL THAT SHE HAD BEEN TORN AWAY FROM
HE RETRACED HIS STEPS AND LOOKED THROUGH THE BARN AND THE HAYLOFT
WHEN THE WHEAT CROP FAILED HE THRESHED THE STRAW AT A DEAD LOSS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW LITTLE GRAIN THERE WAS AND THUS PROVE HIS CASE AGAINST PROVIDENCE
WHY EMIL
THERE SHE WOULD STAND IN A TIN TUB AND PROSECUTE HER BATH WITH VIGOR FINISHING IT BY POURING BUCKETS OF COLD WELL-WATER OVER HER GLEAMING WHITE BODY WHICH NO MAN ON THE DIVIDE COULD HAVE CARRIED VERY FAR
NOT MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE CARED TO READ IT
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD YOUR OWN WAY
LOU ON THE OTHER HAND WAS FUSSY AND FLIGHTY
PERHAPS THEY THINK ME TOO INDEPENDENT
THAT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL IMPULSIVE BARELY TWO YEARS OLDER THAN EMIL THESE FACTS HAD HAD NO WEIGHT WITH ALEXANDRA
DIVING AND SOARING NOW CLOSE TOGETHER NOW FAR APART
OH YOU DON'T KNOW ALEXANDRA AS WELL AS YOU THINK YOU DO
JUST LIKE YOU USED TO BE
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE YOU OVER TO SEE HER TO-MORROW CARL DROPPED THE END OF HIS CIGAR SOFTLY AMONG THE CASTOR BEANS AND SIGHED
MASS WAS AT ELEVEN
SHE TRUSTS US HOW AWFUL IT'S BEEN THESE LAST THREE MONTHS SIGNA HELD THE LANTERN SO THAT HE COULD SEE TO BUCKLE THE STRAPS
AT THE WHEATFIELD CORNER WHERE THE ORCHARD HEDGE ENDED AND THE PATH LED ACROSS THE PASTURE TO THE BERGSONS FRANK STOPPED
SHE HAD REFUSED WITH HORROR THE WARDEN'S CORDIAL INVITATION TO GO THROUGH THE INSTITUTION AS THE CAR LURCHED OVER ITS UNEVEN ROADBED BACK TOWARD LINCOLN ALEXANDRA THOUGHT OF HOW SHE AND FRANK HAD BEEN WRECKED BY THE SAME STORM AND OF HOW ALTHOUGH SHE COULD COME OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT SHE HAD NOT MUCH MORE LEFT IN HER LIFE THAN HE
YOU POOR BOY YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORK IT
GOOD-NIGHT THE LAD CLAPPED HIS CAP ON HIS HEAD AND RAN STRAIGHT DOWN ELEVENTH STREET
I AM STILL RUNNING MY OWN HOUSE AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH EITHER YOU OR ME
I USED TO SING IT TO THE MEXICANS
SHE COULD FEEL HIM APPROACH BEND OVER HER AND LIFT HER AND THEN SHE COULD FEEL HERSELF BEING CARRIED SWIFTLY OFF ACROSS THE FIELDS
YOU AND I ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE WEIGHT WITH HER
I'LL GO AND SEE IF I CAN FIND CARL
I GO BACK WHERE I COME FROM
WHY MUST YOU GO TO THE COAST AT ALL OH I MUST
AMEDEE WAS TO HAVE TWENTY CHILDREN AND NINETEEN OF THEM WERE TO BE GIRLS
SHE WAS TIRED OF EVERYBODY
THE SEASON IN WHICH NATURE RECUPERATES IN WHICH SHE SINKS TO SLEEP BETWEEN THE FRUITFULNESS OF AUTUMN AND THE PASSION OF SPRING
OF ALL THE BEWILDERING THINGS ABOUT A NEW COUNTRY THE ABSENCE OF HUMAN LANDMARKS IS ONE OF THE MOST DEPRESSING AND DISHEARTENING
THE CHIRPING OF THE INSECTS DOWN IN THE LONG GRASS HAD BEEN LIKE THE SWEETEST MUSIC
I GOT NO TIME TO BE SICK
IT'S HIS MOTHER'S FARM AND WHY DON'T HE STAY AT HOME AND HELP HER
OH I GUESS THE DOCTOR KNOWS HIS BUSINESS ALEXANDRA
THERE AIN'T NO MAYBE ABOUT THAT HE TOOK HIS PAIL AND TRUDGED UP THE PATH TO THE HOUSE
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN THEM AT ALL BUT FOR THE REFLECTION OF THE SUNLIGHT UPON THE FOUR PANES OF WINDOW-GLASS
EVEN IN HIS AGITATION HE WAS HANDSOME BUT HE LOOKED A RASH AND VIOLENT MAN
OH THERE'S NO DENYING YOU'RE A SPUNKY LITTLE BUNCH YOU CZECHS HE CALLED BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER
HE HAS HIS SAD TIMES LIKE FATHER
I'VE NO THOUGHT BUT TO GIVE THE THING AN HONEST TRY MUM
IT WAS BOUGHT WITH MONEY BORROWED ON THE HOMESTEAD AND OSCAR AND ME WORKED OURSELVES TO THE BONE PAYING INTEREST ON IT YES YOU PAID THE INTEREST
AS HE RODE PAST THE GRAVEYARD HE LOOKED AT THE BROWN HOLE IN THE EARTH WHERE AMEDEE WAS TO LIE AND FELT NO HORROR
BIRDS AND INSECTS WITHOUT NUMBER BEGAN TO CHIRP TO TWITTER TO SNAP AND WHISTLE TO MAKE ALL MANNER OF FRESH SHRILL NOISES
AND THE BAY WITH A COLT AT HOME OSCAR BRUSHED THE OLD MAN ASIDE
IT WAS ALEXANDRA WHO READ THE PAPERS AND FOLLOWED THE MARKETS AND WHO LEARNED BY THE MISTAKES OF THEIR NEIGHBORS
AND THE ROCKS FOR THE CONIES
ONE ONLY HAS TO DRIVE THROUGH THIS COUNTRY TO SEE THAT YOU'RE ALL AS RICH AS BARONS WE HAVE A GOOD DEAL MORE TO SAY THAN WE HAD WHEN WE WERE POOR SAID LOU THREATENINGLY
SHE DID NOT GLANCE UP AGAIN
HE'S SICK TOO AND OUGHT TO BE IN HIS BED EMIL BENT OVER HECTOR BAPTISTE TRYING TO MAKE HIM BLINK HIS ROUND BEAD-LIKE BLACK EYES
HE OWNED EXACTLY SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY ACRES OF WHAT STRETCHED OUTSIDE HIS DOOR
I THINK YOU ARE ABOUT THE ONLY ONE THAT EVER HELPED ME
OUR PROPERTY OUR HOMESTEAD I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE HOMESTEAD SAID ALEXANDRA QUIETLY
A CHECKED GINGHAM APRON WORKED WITH A DESIGN TEN INCHES BROAD ACROSS THE BOTTOM
ON REACHING HER ROOM SHE LOCKED THE DOOR AND SITTING DOWN ON A CHAIR BY THE DRESSER OPENED THE TELEGRAM
HOLD STILL TILL I PUT THIS ON YOU SHE UNWOUND THE BROWN VEIL FROM HER HEAD AND TIED IT ABOUT HIS THROAT
HE LOOKED PUZZLED AT FIRST THEN SMOTE HIS HANDS TOGETHER AS HE REMEMBERED
FRANK SHABATA HAD NEVER FOUND IT
SHE KEPT HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND IT WAS DURING THAT TIME THAT SHE FORMED A RESOLUTION TO GO TO LINCOLN TO SEE FRANK SHABATA
PEOPLE WHO WANT SUCH LITTLE THINGS SURELY OUGHT TO HAVE THEM HE SAID DRYLY
HE HELD HIS BREATH AND BEGAN TO TREMBLE
ALEXANDRA PRIVATELY RESOLVED THAT SHE WOULD HAVE A TALK WITH IVAR ABOUT THIS AND STIR HIM UP
NEW CLOTHES NEW GAMES NEW SONGS NEW DANCES
IT GIVES ITSELF UNGRUDGINGLY TO THE MOODS OF THE SEASON HOLDING NOTHING BACK
MY SISTER SEND FROM SVEDEN
A STEADY JOB A FEW HOLIDAYS NOTHING TO THINK ABOUT AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT GOLD
THAT OUGHT TO SATISFY YOU IVAR BOWED HUMBLY
IF YOU WEAR THOSE CLOTHES THEY WILL ALL BE PLEASED
I GUESS I'LL GO UPSTAIRS AND GET MY BOOTS OFF
FRANK DROPPED A WORD OF THIS AT THE TABLE BOLTED HIS SUPPER AND RODE OFF TO SAINTE-AGNES WHERE THERE WOULD BE SYMPATHETIC DISCUSSION OF AMEDEE'S CASE AT MARCEL'S SALOON
SHE THOUGHT IT HARD THAT THE GOULDS FOR WHOM SHE HAD NOTHING BUT GOOD WILL SHOULD MAKE HER SO MUCH TROUBLE
OF COURSE ALEXANDRA WENT ON STEADYING HER VOICE A LITTLE THE BOYS ARE STRONG AND WORK HARD BUT WE'VE ALWAYS DEPENDED SO ON FATHER THAT I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN GO AHEAD
WHAT DID SHE HIDE IN HER HEART
I'LL CALL YOU IF I SEE A SNAKE SHE TRIPPED AWAY AND EMIL STOOD LOOKING AFTER HER
AFTER ALL THE PINCUSHIONS AND SOFA PILLOWS AND EMBROIDERED SLIPPERS WERE SOLD EMIL PRECIPITATED A PANIC BY TAKING OUT ONE OF HIS TURQUOISE SHIRT STUDS WHICH EVERY ONE HAD BEEN ADMIRING AND HANDING IT TO THE AUCTIONEER
IF I WERE BIG AND FREE LIKE YOU I WOULDN'T LET ANYTHING MAKE ME UNHAPPY
AS I REMEMBER HER SHE WAS LOVELY AND HAD A GOLD CRESCENT ON HER TURBAN HALF AN HOUR LATER AS THEY WERE LEAVING THE HOUSE CARL AND ALEXANDRA WERE MET IN THE PATH BY A STRAPPING FELLOW IN OVERALLS AND A BLUE SHIRT
HER FACE WAS AS BROWN AS IF IT HAD BEEN VARNISHED AND AS FULL OF WRINKLES AS A WASHERWOMAN'S HANDS
I'M AN ENGRAVER
THEY AGREED THAT HE WAS CRAZIER THAN EVER AND WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO PROVE UP ON HIS LAND BECAUSE HE WORKED IT SO LITTLE
HE CAN SET DOWN LADY SEEING THAT ALEXANDRA REMAINED STANDING
BUT I WILL BE IN A MINUTE
I'VE THOUGHT A GOOD WHILE THERE MIGHT BE
HIS SHAGGY WHITE HAIR FALLING IN A THICK MANE ABOUT HIS RUDDY CHEEKS MADE HIM LOOK OLDER THAN HE WAS
ALEXANDRA TOOK A DEEP BREATH
IN THIS LITTLE BAY A SINGLE WILD DUCK WAS SWIMMING AND DIVING AND PREENING HER FEATHERS DISPORTING HERSELF VERY HAPPILY IN THE FLICKERING LIGHT AND SHADE
AS HE LISTENED TO RAOUL HE SEEMED TO EMERGE FROM THE CONFLICTING EMOTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN WHIRLING HIM ABOUT AND SUCKING HIM UNDER
I WAS SPOILED AT HOME
YOU MUST DANCE WITH ALL THE FRENCH GIRLS
HIS SISTER WAS COMING AND HE GOT UP AND RAN TOWARD HER IN HIS HEAVY SHOES
HE HAD A WAY OF DRAWING OUT HIS CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF SLOWLY BY ONE CORNER FROM HIS BREAST-POCKET THAT WAS MELANCHOLY AND ROMANTIC IN THE EXTREME
THE LEVEL RAYS OF THE SINKING SUN SHONE IN HER CLEAR EYES
CARL HAD CHANGED VERY LITTLE
AS THEY PASSED HER ALEXANDRA WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THEM SPEAKING BOHEMIAN TO EACH OTHER
PERHAPS IT WAS HER OWN LOVE OF COMFORT
BUT I HAVE HAD TO THINK FOR MYSELF A GOOD MANY YEARS AND AM NOT LIKELY TO CHANGE
HE HAD DISCHARGED A GOOD FARM-BOY JAN SMIRKA BECAUSE HE THOUGHT MARIE WAS FOND OF HIM
I'D FORGOT ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT FRANK'S OTHER WIFE
MARIE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT EMIL'S LETTERS WERE WRITTEN MORE FOR HER THAN FOR ALEXANDRA
HE HAD AN INEXHAUSTIBLE STOCK OF STORIES ABOUT THEIR CRIMES AND FOLLIES HOW THEY BRIBED THE COURTS AND SHOT DOWN THEIR BUTLERS WITH IMPUNITY WHENEVER THEY CHOSE
HE SETTLED IN OMAHA AND BECAME A LEADER AND ADVISER AMONG HIS PEOPLE THERE
DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDRA HE WAS SAYING I'VE BEEN THINKING HOW STRANGELY THINGS WORK OUT
WHEN HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE EDGE OF HIS BLADE HE SLIPPED THE WHETSTONE INTO HIS HIP POCKET AND BEGAN TO SWING HIS SCYTHE STILL WHISTLING BUT SOFTLY OUT OF RESPECT TO THE QUIET FOLK ABOUT HIM
YOU REMEMBER THAT SUNDAY WHEN I WENT WITH EMIL UP TO THE FRENCH CHURCH FAIR
IVAR FOUND CONTENTMENT IN THE SOLITUDE HE HAD SOUGHT OUT FOR HIMSELF
WAS IT REALLY AS BAD AS THIS OR NOT OH WORSE
SOUTH OF THE APRICOT TREES CORNERING ON THE WHEATFIELD WAS FRANK'S ALFALFA WHERE MYRIADS OF WHITE AND YELLOW BUTTERFLIES WERE ALWAYS FLUTTERING ABOVE THE PURPLE BLOSSOMS
I WILL HITCH THE BOY'S MARE TO THE CART AND GO SIGNA FOLLOWED HIM ACROSS THE WAGON-SHED TO THE HORSES STABLE
FRANK WENT SLOWLY DOWN TO THE ORCHARD GATE STOPPED AND STOOD FOR A MOMENT LOST IN THOUGHT
EVEN LOU WHO WAS MORE ELASTIC THAN HIS OLDER BROTHER DISLIKED TO DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM THEIR NEIGHBORS
YES SHE TOLD HERSELF IT HAD BEEN WORTH WHILE
WHAT WAS LEFT OF LIFE SEEMED UNIMPORTANT
ABOUT THE STATION EVERYTHING WAS QUIET FOR THERE WOULD NOT BE ANOTHER TRAIN IN UNTIL NIGHT
A BAD ROAD EH GIRLS
BUT ANYHOW WE'VE HAD OUR SAY AT LAST LOU SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
PRUDENT ALEXANDRA
THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR SHE USED IN THESE PROCESSES WAS SOMETIMES A SERIOUS DRAIN UPON THE FAMILY RESOURCES
HIS FARM IN THE ELBE VALLEY INDEED
IT'S PRETTY DARK
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD NOT TO SUFFER
THE OLD MAN FELL IN THE ROAD AT HER FEET AND CAUGHT HER HAND OVER WHICH HE BOWED HIS SHAGGY HEAD
I DON'T BELIEVE I SHALL SUFFER SO MUCH ANY MORE
THEN DASH DOWN TO THE FIELD AND OVERWORK AND BE LAID UP IN BED FOR A WEEK
AND THEN DIDN'T IT HURT HER ANY MORE HE ASKED
PRESENTLY SHE CAME BACK HOLDING A SLENDER ELASTIC YELLOW STICK IN HER HAND
FRANK MARIE CONTINUED FLICKING HER HORSE IS CRANKY AT ME BECAUSE I LOANED HIS SADDLE TO JAN SMIRKA AND I'M TERRIBLY AFRAID HE WON'T TAKE ME TO THE DANCE IN THE EVENING
ENGRAVING'S A VERY INTERESTING PROFESSION BUT A MAN NEVER MAKES ANY MONEY AT IT
MAYBE I SPRINKLE A LITTLE CORN
FATHER WAS NEVER MEANT FOR A FARMER YOU KNOW THAT
THEY RAN DOWN THE HILL IN A DROVE ALL LAUGHING AND CHATTERING AT ONCE SOME IN FRENCH SOME IN ENGLISH
YOU WENT AWAY A LITTLE BOY SHE REACHED FOR HIS SUITCASE AND WHEN HE INTERCEPTED HER SHE THREW UP HER HANDS
EMIL SAID ALEXANDRA WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED AT THE TABLE HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TRAVELING
ALEXANDRA SENT ME TO MOW OUR LOT BUT I'VE DONE HALF A DOZEN OTHERS YOU SEE
HIS CRONIES FORMED A CIRCLE ABOUT HIM ADMIRING AND TEASING THE LITTLE GIRL WHO TOOK THEIR JOKES WITH GREAT GOOD NATURE
IT IS ALWAYS YOU OR SHE HAVING GOT HIS WIFE OUT OF THE WAY LOU SAT DOWN ON THE STEP AND BEGAN TO WHITTLE
THEY HAD BEEN HANDWERKERS AT HOME
FRANK WHO HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE THINGS BLACKER THAN THEY WERE FOR ONCE WANTED TO BELIEVE LESS THAN HE SAW
BUT THESE WILD THINGS ARE GOD'S BIRDS
HOW NICE YOUR DRESS SMELLS ALEXANDRA
YOU CAN'T DO BUSINESS WITH WOMEN OSCAR SAID HEAVILY AS HE CLAMBERED INTO THE CART
SOMETIMES AS SHE LAY THUS LUXURIOUSLY IDLE HER EYES CLOSED SHE USED TO HAVE AN ILLUSION OF BEING LIFTED UP BODILY AND CARRIED LIGHTLY BY SOME ONE VERY STRONG
AND THE SPRING WOULD COME AGAIN
FOR TWELVE YEARS MRS LEE HAD ALWAYS ENTERED ALEXANDRA'S SITTING-ROOM WITH THE SAME EXCLAMATION NOW WE BE YUST-A LIKE OLD TIMES SHE ENJOYED THE LIBERTY ALEXANDRA GAVE HER AND HEARING HER OWN LANGUAGE ABOUT HER ALL DAY LONG
THERE HAD BEEN SUCH A DAY WHEN THEY WERE DOWN ON THE RIVER IN THE DRY YEAR LOOKING OVER THE LAND
AN THEN I FIND HIM HE STOPPED
YOU SEE I GIVE MYSELF AWAY
BECAUSE I AM GOING TO TAKE A TRIP AND YOU CAN GO WITH ME IF YOU WANT TO THE BOYS LOOKED UP IN AMAZEMENT
FOR ALL HIS DULLNESS HOWEVER OSCAR MAKES MORE MONEY THAN HIS BROTHER WHICH ADDS TO LOU'S SHARPNESS AND UNEASINESS AND TEMPTS HIM TO MAKE A SHOW
AS LONG AS THIS SWEETNESS WELLED UP IN HER HEART AS LONG AS HER BREAST COULD HOLD THIS TREASURE OF PAIN
IT'S CURIOUS TOO
SHE TREAT YOU WELL
I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE HIM BY HIMSELF ON THE PRAIRIE FOR CATTLE TO RUN OVER SHE BEGAN TO CRY MORE BITTERLY
SUCH AN IMPERTINENCE AMAZED HIM
HE IS TOO OLD TO WORK IN THE FIELDS BUT HE HITCHES AND UNHITCHES THE WORK-TEAMS AND LOOKS AFTER THE HEALTH OF THE STOCK
HE WAS A QUEERLY SHAPED OLD MAN WITH A THICK POWERFUL BODY SET ON SHORT BOW-LEGS
THEY DID NOT OFFER TO TAKE THE WOMEN TO CHURCH BUT WENT DOWN TO THE BARN IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST AND STAYED THERE ALL DAY
THE WARDEN'S CLOCK TICKED THE YOUNG CONVICT'S PEN SCRATCHED BUSILY IN THE BIG BOOK AND HIS SHARP SHOULDERS WERE SHAKEN EVERY FEW SECONDS BY A LOOSE COUGH WHICH HE TRIED TO SMOTHER
I COME TO YOU SORROWING AND YOU SEND ME AWAY WITH A LIGHT HEART
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE
HE APPROACHED QUIETLY AND LISTENED ON THE DOORSTEP
I AM DESPISED BECAUSE I DO NOT WEAR SHOES BECAUSE I DO NOT CUT MY HAIR AND BECAUSE I HAVE VISIONS
IF HE FELT SORRY FOR HIMSELF THAT WAS HIS OWN AFFAIR
SHE COULD HAVE MET ALL THE MEN ON THE DIVIDE THERE AND WELCOME IF ONLY SHE HADN'T BROUGHT THIS HORROR ON HIM
HE DID NOT HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT OF HER
ALEXANDRA PUT HER HEAD DOWN ON THE DRESSER AND BURST INTO TEARS
MRS LEE HURRIED TO WASH OUT AND IRON HER NEW CROSS-STITCHED APRON WHICH SHE HAD FINISHED ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE
EMIL STARTED UP AND THEN SAT DOWN AGAIN
I'VE NEVER BEEN SORRY EITHER
I WANT THEM TO KEEP THE LAND WE WILL FATHER
CATCH ME IF I FALL EMIL HE CALLED BACK AS HE BEGAN HIS ASCENT
THEY LIKE ANYTHING DIFFERENT EMIL PAUSED
I WON'T SLAVE TO PAY OFF ANOTHER MORTGAGE
CARL SAT MUSING UNTIL THE SUN LEAPED ABOVE THE PRAIRIE AND IN THE GRASS ABOUT HIM ALL THE SMALL CREATURES OF DAY BEGAN TO TUNE THEIR TINY INSTRUMENTS
SEVERAL OF THE FRENCH GIRLS MARIE KNEW WERE HOPING THAT EMIL WOULD TAKE THEM TO SUPPER AND SHE WAS RELIEVED WHEN HE TOOK ONLY HIS SISTER
THERE IS GREAT PEACE HERE CARL AND FREEDOM
I WATCHED IT AN HOUR THIS MORNING BUSY AS I AM WITH ALL THE MEN TO FEED
WHEN HE HEARD HIS DAUGHTER'S ANNOUNCEMENT HE FIRST PRUDENTLY CORKED HIS BEER BOTTLE AND THEN LEAPED TO HIS FEET AND HAD A TURN OF TEMPER
YOU MUSTN'T BE HARD ON THEM ALEXANDRA
WHERE IS YOUR TRUNK IT'S IN HANOVER
ENGAGED INDEED
HE SEEMED TO SHRINK INTO HIMSELF AS HE USED TO DO
ALEXANDRA SMILED AT HIS SOLICITUDE
THAT'S BURNT WOOD YOU KNOW
WHY NO
WHEN EMIL ALIGHTED AT THE SHABATAS GATE HIS HORSE WAS IN A LATHER
MORE THAN ONCE THE HANDSOME GENTLEMAN WAS TORN TO PIECES BEFORE THE FRENCH CLASS BY AN INDIGNANT NUN
I GUESS I GO CRAZY SURE NOUGH ALEXANDRA REMEMBERED THE LITTLE YELLOW CANE SHE HAD FOUND IN FRANK'S CLOTHES-CLOSET
ALEXANDRA WILL MANAGE THE BEST SHE CAN OSCAR WHO WAS USUALLY THE LAST TO SPEAK REPLIED BECAUSE HE WAS THE OLDER YES FATHER
ALL DAY SATURDAY THE CHURCH WAS A SCENE OF BUSTLING ACTIVITY A LITTLE HUSHED BY THE THOUGHT OF AMEDEE
I WOULDN'T HAVE SOLD IT TO ANY ONE ELSE BUT I WAS ALWAYS FOND OF THAT GIRL
I LIKE TREES BECAUSE THEY SEEM MORE RESIGNED TO THE WAY THEY HAVE TO LIVE THAN OTHER THINGS DO
IT WOULD JUST LIE THERE AND WE'D WORK OURSELVES TO DEATH HE SIGHED AND LAID HIS CALLOUSED FIST ON THE TABLE
THEY CAN'T HELP IT
WHAT A HEAVY THING
HIS LIPS WERE COLORLESS HIS FINE TEETH LOOKED YELLOWISH
HER PERSONAL LIFE HER OWN REALIZATION OF HERSELF WAS ALMOST A SUBCONSCIOUS EXISTENCE
IF YOU HAD ANY NERVE YOU'D GET TOGETHER AND MARCH DOWN TO WALL STREET AND BLOW IT UP
THE BLOOD CAME BACK TO HER CHEEKS HER AMBER EYES OPENED SLOWLY AND IN THEM EMIL SAW HIS OWN FACE AND THE ORCHARD AND THE SUN
WOULD YOU TELL ME SOMETHING THAT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS IF YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP ME OUT
THERE SHE IS DOWN IN THE CORNER
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT SWEDISH SONG HE TAUGHT YOU ABOUT THE SHIP BOY YES
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THE APPLE TREES CARL LINSTRUM LOOKED ABOUT HIM
WE WON'T COME OUT ANYWHERE
THERE ARE PLENTY GIRLS WILL HAVE YOU
HE WIPED HIS FOREHEAD WITH A JERK OF HIS HANDKERCHIEF
AND YOU NEVER USED TO BE CROSS TO ME EMIL TOOK A STEP NEARER AND STOOD FROWNING DOWN AT HER BENT HEAD
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO MRS HILLER'S AND I TELEPHONED AS SOON AS THE THUNDER STOPPED BUT SHE HAD NOT BEEN THERE
YES I AM GOING AWAY
HE LIKED TO BEGIN HIS CORN-PLANTING AT THE SAME TIME EVERY YEAR WHETHER THE SEASON WERE BACKWARD OR FORWARD
THE WIND WAS FLAPPING HER BIG HAT AND TEASING A CURL OF HER CHESTNUT-COLORED HAIR
THEY WERE PASSING THE SHABATAS EMPTY HOUSE NOW BUT THEY AVOIDED THE ORCHARD PATH AND TOOK ONE THAT LED OVER BY THE PASTURE POND
I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE WATER SINCE WE CROSSED THE OCEAN WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL
BUT I'VE FOUND IT SOMETIMES PAYS TO MEND OTHER PEOPLE'S FENCES
AND ANYHOW HE IS MUCH MORE GRACEFUL
I MUST BE GETTING BACK
THE SPACE BETWEEN HIS TWO FRONT TEETH WHICH WERE UNUSUALLY FAR APART GAVE HIM THE PROFICIENCY IN WHISTLING FOR WHICH HE WAS DISTINGUISHED AT COLLEGE
BUT WE CAN'T WORK SO MUCH LAND HE SAID DULLY AS IF HE WERE TALKING TO HIMSELF
I WISH YOU WERE A CATHOLIC
AND I HATE IT
ON SUNDAY HER MARRIED BROTHERS CAME TO DINNER
SHE WONDERED THEN HOW THEY COULD HAVE HELPED LOVING EACH OTHER
YOU SEE ALEXANDRA EVERYBODY WHO CAN CRAWL OUT IS GOING AWAY
LET THE BOYS HAUL WATER TO THEM IN BARRELS CLEAN WATER AND PLENTY
ALL THE SAME THE NEIGHBORS WILL BE HAVING A SAY ABOUT IT BEFORE LONG
WHAT A HOPELESS POSITION YOU ARE IN ALEXANDRA HE EXCLAIMED FEVERISHLY
THE GRAVEL PATHS GLITTERED IN THE MOONLIGHT AND BELOW THEM THE FIELDS LAY WHITE AND STILL
IVAR WAS SITTING ON THE FLOOR AT HER FEET
WHY DID YOU GIVE THEM THAT LOVELY BLUE STONE TO SELL
ONLY--IVAR'S RIGHT ABOUT WILD THINGS
THAT WILL MEAN A GREAT DEAL TO ME HERE I'LL WRITE AS LONG AS I LIVE CRIED THE BOY IMPETUOUSLY
LOU NUDGED HIS BROTHER
BUT ANYTHING THAT REMINDED HIM OF HER WOULD BE ENOUGH THE ORCHARD THE MULBERRY TREE
ALL WE HAVE EVER MANAGED TO DO IS TO PAY OUR RENT THE EXORBITANT RENT THAT ONE HAS TO PAY FOR A FEW SQUARE FEET OF SPACE NEAR THE HEART OF THINGS
IT WAS ALEXANDRA WHO COULD ALWAYS TELL ABOUT WHAT IT HAD COST TO FATTEN EACH STEER AND WHO COULD GUESS THE WEIGHT OF A HOG BEFORE IT WENT ON THE SCALES CLOSER THAN JOHN BERGSON HIMSELF
HE WAS TIRED OF MAKING MISTAKES
WE HADN'T MONEY ENOUGH TO GO TO THE CIRCUS
IT IS YOUR FATE TO BE ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY LITTLE MEN
CARL LAUGHED
CARL LAUGHED
I COULDN'T CLIMB IN IT ANYHOW
HE HAD NOW BEEN IN THE STATE PENITENTIARY FOR A MONTH
AFTER SUCH A REVERIE SHE WOULD RISE HASTILY ANGRY WITH HERSELF AND GO DOWN TO THE BATH-HOUSE THAT WAS PARTITIONED OFF THE KITCHEN SHED
AS THEY PASSED BEHIND A LAST YEAR'S STACK AMEDEE CLUTCHED AT HIS RIGHT SIDE AND SANK DOWN FOR A MOMENT ON THE STRAW
SHE WAS ALWAYS SORRY FOR FRANK WHEN HE WORKED HIMSELF INTO ONE OF THESE RAGES AND SHE WAS SORRY TO HAVE HIM ROUGH AND QUARRELSOME WITH HIS NEIGHBORS
SHE SPENT ONE NIGHT AND CAME BACK THE NEXT EVENING
C'EST L'ISLE-ADAM CHEZ MA MERE
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PAINTING BUT ON MY PARLOR WALL I HAVE THE PAINTINGS HE INTERRUPTED NERVOUSLY
BUT AMEDEE SAW NO APPROPRIATE GLOW IN HIS FRIEND'S FACE
PLEASE HURRY
IT IS LIKE AN IRON COUNTRY AND THE SPIRIT IS OPPRESSED BY ITS RIGOR AND MELANCHOLY
WHEN HER HUSBAND CALLED HER SHE PINNED HER HAT ON RESOLUTELY
WHAT DID YOU EVER BURN JOHN HUSS FOR ANYWAY
ALEXANDRA CAN RUN THE FARM ALL RIGHT WITHOUT ME
THEY HAD NEVER SEEN HER SO NERVOUS
THE MORE HE TRIED TO THINK ABOUT IT THE VAGUER HIS CONCEPTION OF IT BECAME
HE LIKED TO SEE AND TO THINK ABOUT AMEDEE'S SUNNY NATURAL HAPPY LOVE
SOME DAYS HIS MIND IS CLOUDY LIKE
I'M SORRY I MADE YOU FEEL BAD AS HE LOOKED DOWN INTO HER TEARFUL EYES THERE WAS A CURIOUS SHARP YOUNG BITTERNESS IN HIS OWN
WE'LL HAVE TO STRAIN TO MEET THE PAYMENTS
AND NOW YOU ARE GOING AWAY
NO YUST LAS NIGHT I MA-AKE
COULD YOU HAVE BELIEVED THAT OF MARIE TOVESKY
THEN I KNOW HE'LL LIKE THEM
ABOUT YOU KEEPING HIM HERE SO LONG
SIGNA HAD SHYLY ASKED TO HAVE THE WEDDING PUT OFF UNTIL EMIL CAME HOME
NOBODY COULD BE THE WORSE FOR IT BUT HERSELF
AND HE FELT THAT OTHER PEOPLE HIS WIFE IN PARTICULAR MUST HAVE PUT HIM THERE
BETTER WAIT UNTIL AFTER IT RAINS EMIL SQUINTED OFF AT THE HORIZON AS IF HE WERE LOOKING FOR CLOUDS
I HAVE ONLY WOMEN COME TO VISIT ME AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO BEHAVE
THE THUD OF THEIR GALLOPING HOOFS INTERRUPTED MANY A COUNTRY BREAKFAST AND BROUGHT MANY A WOMAN AND CHILD TO THE DOOR OF THE FARMHOUSES AS THEY PASSED
I DON'T BELIEVE HE GOES SERENADING MUCH
THERE ARE ALWAYS DREAMERS ON THE FRONTIER
WILL YOU HAVE TO CUT THEM TOO IF I CUT THE GRASS I WILL EMIL SAID TEASINGLY
SHE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE BRIDE HAD CHANGED HER SLIPPERS FOR HEAVY SHOES AND WAS PINNING UP HER SKIRTS
SUDDENLY A WOMAN BURST INTO THE SHED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN BLOWN IN ACCOMPANIED BY A SHOWER OF RAIN-DROPS
WHY DO YOU DREAD THINGS LIKE THAT CARL SHE ASKED EARNESTLY
THIS IS ALWAYS THE WAY MISTRESS
THE CHILDREN WERE ALL IN SCHOOL AND THERE WAS NOBODY ABROAD IN THE STREETS BUT A FEW ROUGH-LOOKING COUNTRYMEN IN COARSE OVERCOATS WITH THEIR LONG CAPS PULLED DOWN TO THEIR NOSES
THEN WHEN THEY ARE ALL ASLEEP SHE WASHES HERSELF IN A LITTLE WOODEN TUB SHE KEEPS UNDER HER BED ALEXANDRA SHOOK WITH LAUGHTER
BUT AS SURE AS WE ARE SITTING HERE TO-NIGHT WE CAN SIT DOWN HERE TEN YEARS FROM NOW INDEPENDENT LANDOWNERS NOT STRUGGLING FARMERS ANY LONGER
WE DIVIDED THE LAND EQUALLY WHEN LOU MARRIED
SHE CRIED IN THE NIGHT
THAT NIGHT SHE HAD A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE COUNTRY FELT ALMOST A NEW RELATION TO IT
ALEXANDRA REACHED HOME IN THE AFTERNOON
MY A-AN'T DIS NICE SHE EXCLAIMED AS SHE STIRRED HER COFFEE
SHE HAD AFTER ALL THOUGHT HE MIGHT COME
SHE RAN INTO THE HOUSE PUT ON A SHORT SKIRT AND A PAIR OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOTS CAUGHT UP A TIN PAIL AND STARTED FOR THE ORCHARD
HE WAS SO SET ON KEEPING THIS LAND
LOU AND OSCAR SHE HAS NOT SEEN SINCE CARL WENT AWAY
BUT I'LL SEE THAT HE DOESN'T BOTHER OTHER PEOPLE
THE TROUBLE WITH LOU IS THAT HE IS TRICKY AND HIS NEIGHBORS HAVE FOUND OUT THAT AS IVAR SAYS HE HAS NOT A FOX'S FACE FOR NOTHING
THAT WAS ONLY A FIREFLY
SHE SEEMED SO EASILY EXCITED TO KINDLE WITH A FIERCE LITTLE FLAME IF ONE BUT BREATHED UPON HER
EVEN CARL NEVER A VERY CHEERFUL BOY AND CONSIDERABLY DARKENED BY THESE LAST TWO BITTER YEARS LOVED THE COUNTRY ON DAYS LIKE THIS FELT SOMETHING STRONG AND YOUNG AND WILD COME OUT OF IT THAT LAUGHED AT CARE
YOU ARE NEARLY NINETEEN NOW AND I WOULDN'T HAVE YOU STAY
SHE WAS FOND OF THE LITTLE GIRLS ESPECIALLY OF MILLY WHO CAME TO SPEND A WEEK WITH HER AUNT NOW AND THEN AND READ ALOUD TO HER FROM THE OLD BOOKS ABOUT THE HOUSE OR LISTENED TO STORIES ABOUT THE EARLY DAYS ON THE DIVIDE
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A TRIUMPHANT KIND OF PERSON CARL HESITATED LOOKING SIDEWISE AT HER STRONG FULL FIGURE
REALLY CARL
UPON THE EYES OF THE GIRL WHO SEEMED TO BE LOOKING WITH SUCH ANGUISHED PERPLEXITY INTO THE FUTURE
BUT I SHOULD NOT WISH YOU TO KEEP ME IF AS THEY SAY IT IS AGAINST YOUR INTERESTS AND IF IT IS HARD FOR YOU TO GET HANDS BECAUSE I AM HERE ALEXANDRA MADE AN IMPATIENT GESTURE BUT THE OLD MAN PUT OUT HIS HAND AND WENT ON EARNESTLY LISTEN MISTRESS IT IS RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE THESE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT
HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS TO LOVE PEOPLE WHEN YOU COULD NOT REALLY SHARE THEIR LIVES
DYNAMITE IT I MEAN WITH A THREATENING NOD
YOU REMEMBER HOW HE LAUGHED
SHE TRIED TO LOOK STRAIGHT INTO HIS FACE WHICH SHE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE WAS HIS
AT FIRST IN TEARFUL AMAZEMENT THEN IN QUIET UNSPOKEN DISGUST
WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF BABIES
NO SHE WON'T COME DOWN
CARL LINSTRUM
THE WILD LAND I ONE JANUARY DAY THIRTY YEARS AGO THE LITTLE TOWN OF HANOVER ANCHORED ON A WINDY NEBRASKA TABLELAND WAS TRYING NOT TO BE BLOWN AWAY
THE SKY WAS STILL RED IN THE WEST AND THE EVENING STAR HUNG DIRECTLY OVER THE BERGSONS WIND-MILL
HIS CHILDREN WERE ALL BOYS AND HE ADORED THIS LITTLE CREATURE
I'VE LIVED HERE A LONG TIME
YOU WILL ONLY SHUT THE WET IN
TO THE SOUTH HIS PLOWED FIELDS
SHE YEARNED TO BE FREE OF THAT
THE PEOPLE ALL LIVED JUST LIKE COYOTES OSCAR GOT UP AND TRAMPED OUT OF THE KITCHEN
I INDULGE THEM WITHOUT HARM TO ANY ONE EVEN TO TRAMPLING IN FILTH WHEN MY DESIRES ARE LOW
I TOLD YOU TO STAY IN THE STORE AND NOT TO COME OUT
I ALMOST FEEL AS IF THERE WERE NOTHING TO GO AHEAD FOR DOES YOUR FATHER KNOW YES I THINK HE DOES
SHE LOOKED THOUGHTFUL AS SHE FOLLOWED IVAR OUT TO THE WAGON-SHED AND HELD THE SHAFTS UP FOR HIM WHILE HE BACKED IN THE MARE AND BUCKLED THE HOLD-BACKS
HE WAS TALL AND FAIR WITH SPLENDID TEETH AND CLOSE-CROPPED YELLOW CURLS AND HE WORE A SLIGHTLY DISDAINFUL EXPRESSION PROPER FOR A YOUNG MAN WITH HIGH CONNECTIONS WHOSE MOTHER HAD A BIG FARM IN THE ELBE VALLEY
WE DON'T MOVE LIGHTLY AND EASILY AS YOU DO AND OUR MINDS GET STIFF
YOU ALL LAUGHED AT ME WHEN I SAID OUR LAND HERE WAS ABOUT READY FOR WHEAT AND I HAD TO RAISE THREE BIG WHEAT CROPS BEFORE THE NEIGHBORS QUIT PUTTING ALL THEIR LAND IN CORN
SHE HAS IT HARD ENOUGH ANYWAY
CARRIED IT LIKE A YOUNG SOLDIER AND A ROUND PLUSH CAP TIED DOWN WITH A THICK VEIL
SHE KNEW THAT EMIL WAS FOND OF MARIE BUT IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HER THAT EMIL'S FEELING MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM HER OWN
NOTHING LIKE THAT
DON'T TALK WILD
SEE LITTLE BROTHER THEY HAVE COME FROM A LONG WAY AND THEY ARE VERY TIRED
ALEXANDRA FROWNED
WHEN THEY CAME BACK LOU PLAYED ON HIS DRAGHARMONIKA AND OSCAR SAT FIGURING AT HIS FATHER'S SECRETARY ALL EVENING
I WANT TO SPEAK TO THEM THEY ARE FEEDING THE HORSES FATHER
ALEXANDRA TRIED NOT TO SEE HIS HIDEOUS CLOTHES
HE KNEW THAT HE WAS TO BLAME
WELL SOMETIMES
AND SURELY YOU NEEDN'T MIND ANYTHING LOU AND OSCAR SAY NOW
WHY ARE WE BETTER FIXED THAN ANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS
HE OUGHT TO BE DONE WASHING OUT HIS CELL BY THIS TIME
AND SOME SNIPE COME TO DRINK
YES I REMEMBER THAT TIME
A LONG TIME AGO WHEN CARL AND I WERE SAY SIXTEEN AND TWELVE A CIRCUS CAME TO HANOVER AND WE WENT TO TOWN IN OUR WAGON WITH LOU AND OSCAR TO SEE THE PARADE
SIT DOWN HERE BY THE POND A MINUTE
THEY SAY THAT YOU CANNOT PREVENT IT IF THE FOLK COMPLAIN OF ME IF YOUR BROTHERS COMPLAIN TO THE AUTHORITIES
MAYBE IT WON'T MAKE HER SORE
I NEVER EXPECT TO HAVE ANY MORE EMIL GRIPPED THE HAND-HOLDS OF HIS SCYTHE AND BEGAN TO MOW
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS DISCOURAGED
MARIE SHABATA SETTLED HERSELF IN HER SEAT AND WATCHED THE RHYTHMICAL MOVEMENT OF THE YOUNG MAN'S LONG ARMS SWINGING HER FOOT AS IF IN TIME TO SOME AIR THAT WAS GOING THROUGH HER MIND
HE WORE A WHITE SHIRT UNDER HIS STRIPED JACKET A HIGH COLLAR AND A NECKTIE VERY CAREFULLY TIED
HIS DAUGHTER CAME AND LIFTED HIM UP ON HIS PILLOWS
I KNEW YOU WERE SO BUSY
MRS LEE HAD PUT ON HER BEST BLACK SATINE DRESS--SHE ABOMINATED WOOLEN STUFFS EVEN IN WINTER--AND A CROCHETED COLLAR FASTENED WITH A BIG PALE GOLD PIN CONTAINING FADED DAGUERREOTYPES OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER
YOUNG FARMERS SELDOM ADDRESS THEIR WIVES BY NAME
IT WAS FROM HANOVER AND IT READ ARRIVED HANOVER LAST NIGHT
IVAR'S QUEER CERTAINLY BUT HE HAS MORE SENSE THAN HALF THE HANDS I HIRE LOU FLEW AT HIS FRIED CHICKEN
WHO ARE SUPPLE AND QUICK IN ADAPTING THEMSELVES TO CIRCUMSTANCES
IT WAS EMPTY
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND IT CARL ALEXANDRA MURMURED
THEN I'M TOO GIDDY
HE STOOD IN AN ATTITUDE OF SELF-DEFENSE HIS FEET WELL APART HIS HANDS CLENCHED AND DRAWN UP AT HIS SIDES SO THAT THE CORDS STOOD OUT ON HIS BARE ARMS
DON'T AGREE TO ANYTHING
HE TURNED AND PEERED THROUGH THE BRANCHES FALLING UPON HIS KNEES AS IF HIS LEGS HAD BEEN MOWED FROM UNDER HIM
HE TOOK HIS CIGAR OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND HELD THE WET END BETWEEN THE FINGERS OF HIS WOOLEN GLOVE
A SHABBY LITTLE TRAVELING MAN WHO WAS JUST THEN COMING OUT OF THE STORE ON HIS WAY TO THE SALOON STOPPED AND GAZED STUPIDLY AT THE SHINING MASS OF HAIR SHE BARED WHEN SHE TOOK OFF HER VEIL
THE SAINTE-AGNES BOYS WERE TO PLAY THE HASTINGS NINE IN A FORTNIGHT AND AMEDEE'S LIGHTNING BALLS WERE THE HOPE OF HIS TEAM
NEXT MORNING WHEN THE SUN ROSE I WENT OUT TO TAKE HER FOOD BUT SHE FLEW UP INTO THE SKY AND WENT ON HER WAY IVAR RAN HIS FINGERS THROUGH HIS THICK HAIR
BEFORE HE STARTED HE HAD WRITTEN HER WHERE HE EXPECTED TO GO BUT HER IDEAS ABOUT ALASKA WERE VAGUE
THERE HE SAT DOWN AND WAITED FOR THE SUN TO RISE
THERE WAS SCARCELY ANYTHING BY WHICH SHE COULD RECOGNIZE HER HANDSOME BOHEMIAN NEIGHBOR
THE HOMESTEADS WERE FEW AND FAR APART
FRANK WAS THE ONLY ONE ALEXANDRA TOLD HERSELF FOR WHOM ANYTHING COULD BE DONE
SHE FELT WELL SATISFIED WITH HER LIFE
T WOULD BE ONLY RIGHT AFTER PUTTIN SO MUCH EXPENSE INTO IT
AT FIVE MINUTES TO ELEVEN HE SAUNTERED UP TO MARIE'S BOOTH AND THE FRENCH BOYS DISPERSED TO FIND THEIR GIRLS
ALEXANDRA BLUSHED AND LAUGHED AGAIN
THAT IS THE WAY
WHAT MADE YOU TEASE ME SO
ALEXANDRA WINKED A REPLY
ONLY BETTER
BUT SHE'S THE KIND THAT WON'T BE DOWNED EASILY
I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THE THINGS THE BOYS SAY ABOUT HIM HONEST I DON'T
EITHER HE SHUT HIS EYES OR HE HAD VERTIGO
MY SOMET'ING SMELL GOOD SHE TURNED TO ALEXANDRA WITH A WINK HER THREE YELLOW TEETH MAKING A BRAVE SHOW I TA-ANK DAT STOP MY YAW FROM ACHE NO MORE SHE SAID CONTENTEDLY
THEY FOLLOWED HER STIFFLY INTO THE SITTING-ROOM
ALL THE FRENCH BOYS STOOD ROUND CHEERING AND HUMPING THEMSELVES UP WHEN EMIL OR AMEDEE WENT OVER THE WIRE AS IF THEY WERE HELPING IN THE LIFT
OSCAR PICKED UP HIS YOUNGEST BOY AND TRUDGED OFF DOWN THE ROAD THE OTHER THREE TROTTING AFTER HIM
THE DAY OF LOVE-TOKENS WAS PAST
WINTER MEMORIES I WINTER HAS SETTLED DOWN OVER THE DIVIDE AGAIN
ONE SELDOM WENT ANYWHERE EVEN TO TOWN WITHOUT THE OTHER
WHAT WAS THE MATTER HAD YOU BEEN CRYING MAYBE I HAD MARIE SMILED GUILTILY
PART II
THE BOYS HAVE TAKEN HIM OFF TO SHOW HIM SOMETHING
COME TO SEE ME SOON ALEXANDRA WALKED FIRMLY DOWN THE PATH AND CARL FOLLOWED HER
SHE WAS NOT A WOMAN WHO COULD WRITE MUCH ABOUT SUCH A THING AND ABOUT HER OWN FEELINGS SHE COULD NEVER WRITE VERY FREELY
THE WOMEN WERE TRIMMING THE ALTAR THE BOYS AND GIRLS WERE BRINGING FLOWERS
I MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO WILL THE SUNSET OVER THERE TO MY BROTHER'S CHILDREN
DON'T THEY EVER TEACH YOU IN YOUR HISTORY CLASSES THAT YOU'D ALL BE HEATHEN TURKS IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE BOHEMIANS EMIL HAD FALLEN TO MOWING
WHEN SHE WAS WITH ALEXANDRA SHE WAS NOT SPONTANEOUS AND FRANK AS SHE USED TO BE
I'VE NEVER FORGOT THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU IN MIEKLEJOHN'S STORE MARIE THE TIME FATHER WAS LYING SICK
THERE IT LAY OUTSIDE HIS DOOR THE SAME LAND THE SAME LEAD-COLORED MILES
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WHEAT HARVEST WHEN THE GRAIN WAS OVER-RIPE AND EVERY HAND WAS NEEDED HE WOULD STOP TO MEND FENCES OR TO PATCH THE HARNESS
MARIE OFTEN RAN IN TO SEE HER NEAREST NEIGHBOR OLD MRS HILLER WHO WAS CRIPPLED WITH RHEUMATISM AND HAD ONLY HER SON THE LAME SHOEMAKER TO TAKE CARE OF HER
BE ON YOUR GOOD BEHAVIOR NOW
IF THEY FEEL ANYTHING AT ALL IT'S THE OLD THINGS BEFORE THEY WERE BORN THAT COMFORT PEOPLE LIKE THE FEELING OF THEIR OWN BED DOES WHEN THEY ARE LITTLE MISTRESS SAID IVAR REPROACHFULLY THOSE ARE BAD THOUGHTS
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE OVER AT LOU'S HOUSE
BUT I CAN REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEFORE
I'M GOING TO PAINT SOME SLIDES FOR IT ON GLASS OUT OF THE HANS ANDERSEN BOOK ALEXANDRA SEEMED ACTUALLY CHEERED
SHE WISHED SHE COULD ASK THEM WHETHER THEY HAD KNOWN EMIL
DON'T LET THEM FOOL YOU LOU WAS APT TO BE FOOLED HIMSELF
WHY TO PAY US A VISIT
HE IS COMING OVER TO-MORROW
NONE OF THEM HAD ANY APPEARANCE OF PERMANENCE AND THE HOWLING WIND BLEW UNDER THEM AS WELL AS OVER THEM
THE GRUDGE WAS FUNDAMENTAL
WHEN THE TWO NEIGHBORS WENT TO SEE EACH OTHER THEY HAD TO GO ROUND BY THE WAGON-ROAD WHICH WAS TWICE AS FAR
NO I CAN SEE THERE'S A CHANCE THAT WAY
DO YOU KNOW I WAS SURE IT WOULD BE LIKE THAT
WHAT ABOUT OSCAR MET HER EYES BLANKLY
WOULD YOU RATHER I WENT OFF IN THE SAND HILLS AND LIVED LIKE IVAR MARIE'S FACE FELL UNDER HIS BROODING GAZE
I'VE BEEN WISHING YOU COULD STAY WITH ME THIS WINTER THAT'S JUST WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO ALEXANDRA
VIII ON THE EVENING OF THE DAY OF ALEXANDRA'S CALL AT THE SHABATAS A HEAVY RAIN SET IN
I'VE BEEN THINKING BOYS SHE WENT ON THAT MAYBE I AM TOO SET AGAINST MAKING A CHANGE
SHALL I CALL THEM HE SIGHED
HER TRAINING HAD ALL BEEN TOWARD THE END OF MAKING HER PROFICIENT IN WHAT SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN TO DO
HE HAD NOT OVERHEARD MUCH OF THEIR DIALOGUE BUT HE FELT THE IMPORT OF IT
SHE LOVED TO TAKE A LITTLE BRANDY WITH HOT WATER AND SUGAR BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED AND ALEXANDRA ALWAYS HAD IT READY FOR HER
WE'LL LIVE LONGER THAN HE WILL
I WONDER WHY I HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO PROSPER IF IT IS ONLY TO TAKE MY FRIENDS AWAY FROM ME I DON'T DECEIVE MYSELF CARL SAID FRANKLY
WE HAVE NO HOUSE NO PLACE NO PEOPLE OF OUR OWN
SHE NEVER SAW HIM BUT WITH EYES CLOSED SHE COULD FEEL THAT HE WAS YELLOW LIKE THE SUNLIGHT AND THERE WAS THE SMELL OF RIPE CORNFIELDS ABOUT HIM
THE PASTURE WAS FLOODED WITH LIGHT
THE AUCTION WAS THE LIVELIEST PART OF THE ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE FRENCH BOYS ALWAYS LOST THEIR HEADS WHEN THEY BEGAN TO BID SATISFIED THAT THEIR EXTRAVAGANCE WAS IN A GOOD CAUSE
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE IVAR'S POND
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TELL MY FORTUNE HE MURMURED
ROLLS AWAY FROM THE SHEAR NOT EVEN DIMMING THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE METAL WITH A SOFT DEEP SIGH OF HAPPINESS
BUT IN THE MEAN TIME HE WANTED HER TO FEEL THAT LIFE WAS AS UGLY AND AS UNJUST AS HE FELT IT
AS HE STUDIED HER BENT HEAD HE LOOKED UP AT THE PICTURE OF JOHN BERGSON ABOVE THE LAMP
HE TOO WAS LONELY
SOMETIMES I THINK ONE BOY DOES JUST AS WELL AS ANOTHER FOR YOU
MAYBE SHE'D AS SOON BE FORTY AS NOT XI EMIL CAME HOME AT ABOUT HALF-PAST SEVEN O'CLOCK THAT EVENING
LET'S SEE HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN AWAY FROM HERE SIXTEEN YEARS
NO I WOULD RATHER HAVE EMIL LIKE YOU THAN LIKE THEM
I HAVEN'T ANY FEARS
SOMETIMES SHE FORGOT WHICH WERE THE PRINTED STORIES AND WHICH WERE THE REAL STORIES IT ALL SEEMED SO FAR AWAY
WHEN IT ENCIRCLED AND SWELLED WITH THAT IMAGE OF GOLD
II LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OF A BRILLIANT OCTOBER DAY ALEXANDRA BERGSON DRESSED IN A BLACK SUIT AND TRAVELING-HAT ALIGHTED AT THE BURLINGTON DEPOT IN LINCOLN
AN IDEA FLASHED INTO HIS MIND AND HIS SENSE OF INJURY AND OUTRAGE GREW
WHEN THE CHILDREN WERE LITTLE SHE USED TO LOAD THEM ALL INTO THE WAGON THE BABY IN ITS CRIB AND GO FISHING HERSELF
THE FARM-HANDS WOULD ALWAYS DO ANYTHING FOR MARIE
THEY STAYED AT THE OLD LADY'S DOOR BUT A MOMENT AND THEN CAME OUT TO SPEND THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON IN THE SUNNY FIELDS
HE WOULD RATHER BE EATEN BY WILD BEASTS THAN SEE HER MOVE ON THE GROUND AS SHE HAD MOVED IN THE ORCHARD
HE HAD A SWEET TENOR VOICE AND WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN HE LOVED TO SING
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND THEY TALK TO OUR BOYS AND MAKE THEM LOW-SPIRITED
OH IT'S NOT THAT
THEY HAD SPENT THE LAST PENNY OF THEIR SMALL CHANGE
FATHER DUCHESNE DIVIDED HIS TIME BETWEEN THE LIVING AND THE DEAD
YOU SEE WE'VE ALL DEPENDED SO ON YOU HE SAID EVEN FATHER
HE LOOKED OLDER THAN HIS YEARS AND NOT VERY STRONG
IT HAS BEEN SO NICE FOR ME TO FEEL THAT THERE WAS A FRIEND AT THE OTHER END OF IT AGAIN CARL SMILED A LITTLE RUEFULLY
IN THE DARKNESS AND SILENCE EMIL WAS NOT LIKELY TO THINK LONG ABOUT ALEXANDRA
HE HAD MANY FRIENDS THERE AND THEY WROTE TO HIM UP TO THE TIME HE DIED
WELL LOU IF ANY OF THE NEIGHBORS TRY THAT I'LL HAVE MYSELF APPOINTED IVAR'S GUARDIAN AND TAKE THE CASE TO COURT THAT'S ALL
WE SHALL HAVE TO BEHAVE LIKE MR LINSTRUM
BUT HOW COULD YOU TAKE HOLD OF WHAT WASN'T THERE
EMIL WAS A GOOD BOY AND ONLY BAD BOYS RAN AFTER MARRIED WOMEN
THE WIND FLAPPED THE SKIRTS OF HER HEAVY COAT ABOUT HER
WE'RE GETTING ON TO A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS AS IVAR DROVE A DOUBLE CARRIAGE UP TO THE GATE ANNIE CAME OUT IN A HAT THAT LOOKED LIKE THE MODEL OF A BATTLESHIP
MAYBE IT'S LIKE THAT WITH THE DEAD
HER EARS HAD BEEN PIERCED AGAINST A PIECE OF CORK BY HER GREAT-AUNT WHEN SHE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD
GLAD TO SEE YOU OSCAR FOLLOWED WITH HOW D DO CARL COULD NOT TELL WHETHER THEIR OFFISHNESS CAME FROM UNFRIENDLINESS OR FROM EMBARRASSMENT
I HATE TO SEE THEM WHEN THEY ARE FIRST SHOT
THEY MUST HAVE WATER TO DRINK AND TO BATHE IN BEFORE THEY CAN GO ON WITH THEIR JOURNEY
THE NEXT MORNING BROKE CLEAR AND BRILLIANT BUT FRANK SAID THE GROUND WAS TOO WET TO PLOUGH SO HE TOOK THE CART AND DROVE OVER TO SAINTE-AGNES TO SPEND THE DAY AT MOSES MARCEL'S SALOON
YOU BELIEVE THAT EVERY ONE SHOULD WORSHIP GOD IN THE WAY REVEALED TO HIM
THEN I WENT AHEAD AND BUILT THIS HOUSE
NO NO NO
CARL WATCHED THEM AS THEY MOVED SLOWLY DOWN THE DRAW
I HAD HOPED YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND A LITTLE WHY I DO WANT TO
III ONE EVENING A WEEK AFTER SIGNA'S WEDDING EMIL WAS KNEELING BEFORE A BOX IN THE SITTING-ROOM PACKING HIS BOOKS
NO GOOD SHE REASONED EVER CAME FROM TALKING ABOUT SUCH THINGS AND WHILE MARIE WAS THINKING ALOUD ALEXANDRA HAD BEEN STEADILY SEARCHING THE HAT-BOXES
COME HE SAID I'VE FED AND WATERED YOUR TEAM AND THE WAGON IS READY HE CARRIED EMIL OUT AND TUCKED HIM DOWN IN THE STRAW IN THE WAGONBOX
THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF NEW MACHINERY TO MANAGE AND THE WHEAT SO RIPE IT WILL BEGIN TO SHATTER NEXT WEEK
IT NO LONGER CONTRACTED AND BROUGHT THEM SUDDENLY TOGETHER
WE ARE ALL ALIKE
ALL ANGELIQUE'S FOLKS ARE BAKING FOR IT AND ALL AMEDEE'S TWENTY COUSINS
THE GIRLS AND EVEN THE BOYS WERE KISSED AND EMBRACED AND WEPT OVER
HE LIKED TO KEEP THE PLACE UP BUT HE NEVER GOT ROUND TO DOING ODD JOBS UNTIL HE HAD TO NEGLECT MORE PRESSING WORK TO ATTEND TO THEM
I'M NOT A PAINTER ALEXANDRA
I FIND IT HARD TO KEEP THAT UP FROM ONE YEAR'S END TO ANOTHER I SHOULDN'T THINK YOU'D BE VERY SUCCESSFUL AT THAT KIND OF THING ALEXANDRA CARL SEEMED TO FIND THE IDEA AMUSING
SOMEBODY WILL HAVE TO GO UP AFTER HER
AFTER HE LEFT MARIE AT HER GATE HE WANDERED ABOUT THE FIELDS ALL NIGHT TILL MORNING PUT OUT THE FIREFLIES AND THE STARS
WHAT A VOICE SHE HAD
MARIE HUNG UP THE RECEIVER
WE THOUGHT YOU HAD GOOD SENSE ALEXANDRA
SHE WORE A MAN'S LONG ULSTER NOT AS IF IT WERE AN AFFLICTION BUT AS IF IT WERE VERY COMFORTABLE AND BELONGED TO HER
THEY TELL THE OTHER BIRDS AND NEXT YEAR MORE COME THIS WAY
THE SPIRIT HE HAD MET IN MUSIC WAS HIS OWN
I AM GOING TO LEARN ENGRAVING WITH A GERMAN ENGRAVER THERE AND THEN TRY TO GET WORK IN CHICAGO ALEXANDRA'S HANDS DROPPED IN HER LAP
WE HAD SUPPER AT FIVE O'CLOCK AT THE FAIR EMIL WAS GLAD TO ESCAPE AND GET TO HIS OWN ROOM
THE NORWEGIAN AND SWEDISH LADS WERE MUCH MORE SELF-CENTRED APT TO BE EGOTISTICAL AND JEALOUS
I TA-ANK I BETTER DO YUST LIKE HE SAY SHE MURMURED IN CONFUSION
YOU MUST HAVE THE SEAT ALEXANDRA
THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD HAVE SATISFIED THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS FAILURE AT THE UNIVERSITY
BUT WHAT AM I GOING TO DO IF YOU KEEP TORMENTING ME LIKE THIS SHE ADDED PLAINTIVELY
AFTER SHE HAD TRIED TO KILL HERSELF ONCE OR TWICE HER FOLKS GOT WORRIED AND SENT HER OVER TO IOWA TO VISIT SOME RELATIONS
SHE UNDRESSED ALEXANDRA AND GAVE HER A HOT FOOTBATH WHILE IVAR MADE GINGER TEA IN THE KITCHEN
JUST LIKE THEM ALEXANDRA DREW BACK
ALEXANDRA HAD LEFT LINCOLN AFTER MIDNIGHT AND CARL HAD MET HER AT THE HANOVER STATION EARLY IN THE MORNING
THEY CAN ONLY STAND IT THERE A LITTLE WHILE--HALF AN HOUR MAYBE
HIS FACE WAS INTELLIGENT SENSITIVE UNHAPPY
BUT PRACTISING ON IT SO MUCH SPOILS HER TOUCH
WE ARE ONLY ONE MORE DRAG ONE MORE THING YOU LOOK OUT FOR AND FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR
MARIE I WON'T BOTHER YOU ANY MORE IF YOU WILL TELL ME JUST ONE THING
SHE WISHED SHE WERE BACK ON THE DIVIDE
I CAN STAY ONLY A FEW DAYS
MARIE WHEN SHE WAS ALONE OR WHEN SHE SAT SEWING IN THE EVENING OFTEN THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE DOWN THERE WHERE EMIL WAS
POOR FATHER HE WAS AN EASY MAN BUT HE WAS PERFECTLY MERCILESS WHEN IT CAME TO WATERING THE ORCHARD THAT'S ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT GERMANS
WHEN HE CAME TO THE CORNER HE STOPPED SHORT AND PUT HIS HAND OVER HIS MOUTH
THEN ALEXANDRA WILL BE DISAPPOINTED THE YOUNG MAN SAID ROUGHLY
AS OLD NAPOLEON BRUNOT SAID AT THE FAIR I WOULDN'T GO LOVERING AFTER NO WOMAN
AM I TO LET ANY OLD WOMAN'S HOGS ROOT UP MY WHEAT
EVEN HER TALK WITH THE BOYS HAD NOT TAKEN AWAY THE FEELING THAT HAD OVERWHELMED HER WHEN SHE DROVE BACK TO THE DIVIDE THAT AFTERNOON
I'VE BEEN AWAY ENGRAVING OTHER MEN'S PICTURES AND YOU'VE STAYED AT HOME AND MADE YOUR OWN HE POINTED WITH HIS CIGAR TOWARD THE SLEEPING LANDSCAPE
ARE THE BUTTONS REAL SILVER
EVERYTHING I SAY MAKES YOU CROSS DON'T IT
IT WAS STILL A WILD THING THAT HAD ITS UGLY MOODS
NO ONE EVER BLAMED HIM FOR GRANDFATHER'S DISGRACE
HER MIND WAS A WHITE BOOK WITH CLEAR WRITING ABOUT WEATHER AND BEASTS AND GROWING THINGS
FATHER SAYS THE PEOPLE IN THE MOUNTAINS STILL DO QUEER THINGS SOMETIMES,--THEY BELIEVE THAT TREES BRING GOOD OR BAD LUCK EMIL LOOKED SUPERIOR
HE'S FEATHERING HIS NEST
TELL THE BOYS TO COME HERE DAUGHTER
DO THEY
EMIL WAS GREATLY AMUSED AT HER AIR OF PROPRIETORSHIP AND AT AMEDEE'S SHAMELESS SUBMISSION TO IT
MAYBE THE SUPPER WILL TEMPT HIM
FIVE MILES EAST OF SAINTE-AGNES THEY MET THE BISHOP IN HIS OPEN CARRIAGE ATTENDED BY TWO PRIESTS
COME IN ALEXANDRA
I YUST TA-AKE A LIDDLE YELLY NOW TOO I TA-ANK ALEXANDRA AND MARIE LAUGHED AT HER FOREHANDEDNESS AND FELL TO TALKING OF THEIR OWN AFFAIRS
WOOD-ENGRAVING IS THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT AND THAT HAD GONE OUT BEFORE I BEGAN
SILVER WASN'T THE ONLY ISSUE HE NODDED MYSTERIOUSLY
IS IT FOR A PENANCE OR WHAT NO SISTER
HER HEAD IN ITS WHITE SCARF DROOPED FORWARD A LITTLE
SHE SEEMED LIKE A TROUBLED SPIRIT LIKE SOME SHADOW OUT OF THE EARTH CLINGING TO HIM AND ENTREATING HIM TO GIVE HER PEACE
YOU OUGHT TO DO JUST AS YOU WISH AND I THINK CARL'S A FINE FELLOW
IT SEEMED UNREASONABLE THAT LIFE SHOULD HAVE LANDED HIM IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS
GO TO THE COUNTY CLERK AND ASK HIM WHO OWNS MY LAND AND WHETHER MY TITLES ARE GOOD LOU TURNED TO HIS BROTHER
ALL NIGHT I HAD TO BE GETTING UP AND MAKING MUSTARD PLASTERS TO PUT ON HIS STOMACH
BUT SUPPOSE THERE WASN'T ANY BADGER-HOLE LOU PERSISTED
A HUNTING SCENE WITH FIR TREES AND A STAG AND DOGS AND HUNTSMEN
I DIDN'T WHEN I MARRIED HIM BUT I SUPPOSE I WAS TOO YOUNG TO STAY LIKE THAT MARIE SIGHED
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU MY KITTEN SISTER MY KITTEN
HE STOPPED HIS HORSE TO ADMIT THIS TO HIMSELF THE MORE DIRECTLY TO THINK IT OUT THE MORE CLEARLY
HE FELT HER YOUTH AND STRENGTH HOW EASILY SHE MOVED AND STOOPED AND LIFTED
THAT SHE TOLD HERSELF WAS VERY WELL
HIS NOSE AND HIS CHUBBY CHEEKS WERE CHAPPED AND RED WITH COLD
BAD ENOUGH THEN HE WITHDREW TO A CORNER AND SAT GLOWERING AT HIS WIFE
FULL OF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE GAY LIFE IN THE OLD MEXICAN CAPITAL IN THE DAYS WHEN THE STRONG HAND OF PORFIRIO DIAZ WAS STILL STRONG
WE WERE WILLING YOU SHOULD HOLD THE LAND AND HAVE THE GOOD OF IT BUT YOU GOT NO RIGHT TO PART WITH ANY OF IT
BUT SHE COULD NOT STAY IN THE HOUSE THIS EVENING
YES HE BROKE IN EVERYBODY'S LAUGHING TO SEE YOU GET TOOK IN
WHAT A WONDERFUL PLACE YOU HAVE MADE OF THIS ALEXANDRA HE TURNED AND LOOKED BACK AT THE WIDE MAP-LIKE PROSPECT OF FIELD AND HEDGE AND PASTURE
HE HAD FLUNG HIMSELF AT THE SOIL WITH SAVAGE ENERGY
CHRIST SAYS SO IN THE NEW TESTAMENT NOW IVAR LOU ASKED MAY WE WATER OUR HORSES AT YOUR POND AND GIVE THEM SOME FEED
HIS BACK WITH ITS HIGH SHARP SHOULDERS LOOKED LIKE THE BACK OF AN OVER-WORKED GERMAN PROFESSOR OFF ON HIS HOLIDAY
SHE WAS NEVER AFRAID
FOR TWO YEARS THE STORM HAD BEEN GATHERING IN HIM
YOU KNOW THEIR WAY
SIGNA ASKED PERMISSION TO SLEEP ON THE SLAT LOUNGE OUTSIDE HER DOOR
DIDN'T I TELL YOU SHE'D GET US INTO TROUBLE OF SOME KIND IF YOU BROUGHT HER
THEN SHE WENT TO SLEEP
ALEXANDRA TOOK THE YELLOW ENVELOPE AND LOOKED AT IT IN PERPLEXITY THEN STEPPED INTO THE ELEVATOR WITHOUT OPENING IT
HE SEEMED TO HAVE STIRRED UP IN HIS MIND A DISGUST THAT HAD PARALYZED HIS FACULTIES
THEY'RE TOO HAPPY TO KILL
YOU FEEL THAT PROPERLY ALEXANDRA'S HOUSE IS THE BIG OUT-OF-DOORS AND THAT IT IS IN THE SOIL THAT SHE EXPRESSES HERSELF BEST
WHY HAD SHE BEEN SO CARELESS
IN THE SAME INSTANT SHE FELT HIS LIPS
ISN'T SHE LIKE A LITTLE BROWN RABBIT ALEXANDRA LAUGHED
I WON'T MOVE
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM AND HE WON'T TALK SENSE IF HE'S ANGRY
THEY LOST EVERYTHING THEY SPENT
HIS WHITE CLOAK WAS THROWN OVER HIS FACE AND HIS HEAD WAS BENT A LITTLE FORWARD
ALEXANDRA HAD SET OUT FROM HOME EARLY LEAVING THE HOUSE TO SIGNA AND NELSE JENSEN WHO WERE TO BE MARRIED NEXT WEEK
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND IT
I WISH THAT MAN WOULD TAKE ME FOR A PARTNER
HE HAD NEVER IMAGINED SUCH HORROR
COME NOW LOU
II IF ALEXANDRA HAD HAD MUCH IMAGINATION SHE MIGHT HAVE GUESSED WHAT WAS GOING ON IN MARIE'S MIND AND SHE WOULD HAVE SEEN LONG BEFORE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN EMIL'S
THE ISSUE SEEMED TO HIM TOO FAR-FETCHED TO WARRANT DISCUSSION
AND ANYHOW THERE'S NOTHING TO UNDERSTAND SHE STRUCK THE GROUND WITH HER LITTLE FOOT FIERCELY
THEY HAD FALLEN A LITTLE APART FROM EACH OTHER AND WERE PERFECTLY STILL--NO NOT QUITE
HIS BED STOOD IN THE SITTING-ROOM NEXT TO THE KITCHEN
THREE BIG BOHEMIANS WERE DRINKING RAW ALCOHOL TINCTURED WITH OIL OF CINNAMON
WAS SHE ILL
BUT I HOPE HE WON'T DO THAT
I'M AFRAID SHE IS OUT SOMEWHERE AND WILL GET HER DEATH OF COLD IVAR PUT ON HIS CAP AND TOOK UP THE LANTERN
THEY ARE TAKING ON NEW MEN THEN
HIS SISTER WAS A TALL STRONG GIRL AND SHE WALKED RAPIDLY AND RESOLUTELY AS IF SHE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS GOING AND WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO NEXT
BUT HE SCOLDS ME ABOUT EVERYTHING LIKE AS IF HE WANTED TO HAVE ME AT ALEXANDRA'S LEFT SAT A VERY OLD MAN BAREFOOT AND WEARING A LONG BLUE BLOUSE OPEN AT THE NECK
NOT TO MAKE MONEY BUT TO MAKE SOMETHING OF HIMSELF
WHY IS IT
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY THINK THAT WELL YOU DIDN'T DANCE WITH THEM MUCH AT RAOUL MARCEL'S PARTY AND I COULD TELL HOW THEY TOOK IT BY THE WAY THEY LOOKED AT YOU--AND AT ME ALL RIGHT SAID EMIL SHORTLY STUDYING THE GLITTERING BLADE OF HIS SCYTHE
ONE ROOM IS PAPERED CARPETED OVER-FURNISHED
IT'S ONLY NECESSARY FOR ONE PROPERTY-OWNER IN THE TOWNSHIP TO MAKE COMPLAINT AND HE'LL BE TAKEN UP BY FORCE
MARIE IS GOING TO TELL FORTUNES AND SHE SENT TO OMAHA FOR A BOHEMIAN DRESS HER FATHER BROUGHT BACK FROM A VISIT TO THE OLD COUNTRY
THEIR NEIGHBORS CERTAINLY KNEW EVEN LESS ABOUT FARMING THAN HE DID
OUR PLACE WOULDN'T BRING NOW WHAT IT WOULD SIX YEARS AGO
NOT FOR SOME TIME I HOPE ALEXANDRA SPOKE IN AN EVEN QUIET TONE THAT OFTEN EXASPERATED HER BROTHERS
WILL YOU GO AWAY WITH ME MARIE MARIE STARTED UP AND STEPPED ACROSS THE STILE
SHE COULD NOT VERY WELL TAKE YOUR PLACE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN
SHE HAD NEVER QUITE FORGIVEN JOHN BERGSON FOR BRINGING HER TO THE END OF THE EARTH
NO
I KNOW YOU AND OSCAR HAVE ALWAYS EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD BE LEFT TO YOUR CHILDREN AND I'M NOT SURE BUT WHAT YOU'RE RIGHT
NOT MANY BIRDS JUST NOW
NO GUNS NO GUNS HE SHOUTED WAVING HIS ARMS DISTRACTEDLY
I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL BUT YOU MUST NOT FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR ME IN THINGS OF THIS SORT
I EXPECT THAT IS THE ONLY WAY ONE PERSON EVER REALLY CAN HELP ANOTHER
OLD TOVESKY FORGAVE HIS DAUGHTER BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND BOUGHT HER A FARM IN THE COUNTRY THAT SHE HAD LOVED SO WELL AS A CHILD
HABIT WAS VERY STRONG WITH MRS BERGSON AND HER UNREMITTING EFFORTS TO REPEAT THE ROUTINE OF HER OLD LIFE AMONG NEW SURROUNDINGS HAD DONE A GREAT DEAL TO KEEP THE FAMILY FROM DISINTEGRATING MORALLY AND GETTING CARELESS IN THEIR WAYS
THE WILD ASSES QUENCH THEIR THIRST
MARIE STIFFENED UNDER THAT KIND CALM HAND
BUT NOW THAT SHE WAS THERE SHE WANTED TO BE LET ALONE TO RECONSTRUCT HER OLD LIFE IN SO FAR AS THAT WAS POSSIBLE
SHE MADE A YELLOW JAM OF THE INSIPID GROUND-CHERRIES THAT GREW ON THE PRAIRIE FLAVORING IT WITH LEMON PEEL
WHY AREN'T THEY UP IN THE CATHOLIC GRAVEYARD FREE-THINKERS REPLIED THE YOUNG WOMAN LACONICALLY
THIS KID LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE INDIAN BABIES ANGELIQUE MADE A FACE AT HIM BUT OLD MRS CHEVALIER HAD BEEN TOUCHED ON A SORE POINT AND SHE LET OUT SUCH A STREAM OF FIERY PATOIS THAT EMIL FLED FROM THE KITCHEN AND MOUNTED HIS MARE
HIS HANDS WERE THIN AND WHITE AND WELL CARED FOR AND HE HAD A SEAL RING ON HIS LITTLE FINGER
IT SEEMED BEAUTIFUL TO HER RICH AND STRONG AND GLORIOUS
WELL MARIE SAID IT WOULD SERVE US ALL RIGHT IF YOU WALKED OFF WITH HIM DID SHE
IT WAS GROWING DARK WHEN SHE REACHED THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS
IT WAS FROM FACING THIS VAST HARDNESS THAT THE BOY'S MOUTH HAD BECOME SO BITTER
HE SENT THEM WITH THE DRESS AND SAID I COULD KEEP THEM MARIE WORE A SHORT RED SKIRT OF STOUTLY WOVEN CLOTH A WHITE BODICE AND KIRTLE A YELLOW SILK TURBAN WOUND LOW OVER HER BROWN CURLS AND LONG CORAL PENDANTS IN HER EARS
THE SICK MAN HEARD HIS WIFE STRIKE A MATCH IN THE KITCHEN AND THE LIGHT OF A LAMP GLIMMERED THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE DOOR
I DON'T WANT YOU BOYS ALWAYS TO HAVE TO WORK LIKE THIS
YES THERE WOULD BE A DIRTY WAY OUT OF LIFE IF ONE CHOSE TO TAKE IT
THE HAND SHE HELD WAS COVERED WITH DARK STAINS WHERE SHE HAD KISSED IT
THEY WERE ALL DELIGHTED WITH HER FOR THEY SELDOM SAW SO PRETTY AND CAREFULLY NURTURED A CHILD
BUT I CAN'T MY DEAR I CAN'T
AFTER SUPPER THE YOUNG PEOPLE PLAYED CHARADES FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THEIR ELDERS WHO SAT GOSSIPING BETWEEN THEIR GUESSES
I AM SURE SHE TRIED HARD
ALWAYS THE SAME YEARNING THE SAME PULLING AT THE CHAIN--UNTIL THE INSTINCT TO LIVE HAD TORN ITSELF AND BLED AND WEAKENED FOR THE LAST TIME UNTIL THE CHAIN SECURED A DEAD WOMAN WHO MIGHT CAUTIOUSLY BE RELEASED
IT SEEMED STRANGE THAT NOW HE SHOULD HAVE TO HIDE THE THING THAT AMEDEE WAS SO PROUD OF THAT THE FEELING WHICH GAVE ONE OF THEM SUCH HAPPINESS SHOULD BRING THE OTHER SUCH DESPAIR
THE YOUNGER BOY WAS QUICKER BUT VACILLATING
I BRING MANY GOOD CATHOLICS INTO THIS WORLD I HOPE AND THAT'S A WAY I HELP THE CHURCH EMIL LOOKED DOWN AND PATTED HIM ON THE SHOULDER
THE BOHEMIANS YOU KNOW WERE TREE WORSHIPERS BEFORE THE MISSIONARIES CAME
FRANK WAS OUT LATE THAT NIGHT
HE NEVER REMINDED HER OF HOW MUCH SHE HAD ONCE LOVED HIM
THERE WAS SCARCELY A FAMILY IN TOWN THAT WAS NOT REPRESENTED IN THE CONFIRMATION CLASS BY A COUSIN AT LEAST
MARIE CAUGHT FRANK'S ARM AND DRAGGED HIM TO THE SAME TABLE MANAGING TO GET SEATS OPPOSITE THE BERGSONS SO THAT SHE COULD HEAR WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT
HOW SOON DOES HE INTEND TO GO AWAY FROM HERE I DON'T KNOW LOU
ALWAYS THE SAME PATIENT FIELDS THE PATIENT LITTLE TREES THE PATIENT LIVES
THEY BELIEVED THAT A VERY WICKED THING TO DO ON SUNDAY AND IT RELIEVED THEIR FEELINGS
HE WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT THE TIRED PIONEERS OVER WHOM HIS BLADE GLITTERED
HE SNATCHED OFF HIS CAP AND STOOD BAREHEADED AND PANTING
AS EMIL CAME AND WENT BY HER CHAIR WITH HIS BOOKS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN SO HARD TO LEAVE HIS SISTER SINCE HE FIRST WENT AWAY TO SCHOOL
HE HAD BEEN DEPRESSED THROUGHOUT THE MEAL AND HAD PAID NO HEED TO THE TALK OF THE MEN EVEN WHEN THEY MENTIONED CORNSTALK BLOAT UPON WHICH HE WAS SURE TO HAVE OPINIONS
HE WAS BURNED A DULL RED DOWN TO HIS NECKBAND AND THERE WAS A HEAVY THREE-DAYS STUBBLE ON HIS FACE
LET ME DOWN UNCLE JOE SHE SAID I WANT TO GIVE SOME OF MY CANDY TO THAT NICE LITTLE BOY I FOUND SHE WALKED GRACIOUSLY OVER TO EMIL FOLLOWED BY HER LUSTY ADMIRERS WHO FORMED A NEW CIRCLE AND TEASED THE LITTLE BOY UNTIL HE HID HIS FACE IN HIS SISTER'S SKIRTS AND SHE HAD TO SCOLD HIM FOR BEING SUCH A BABY
MRS LEE WAS FIRM WITH HERSELF AT DINNER AND REFUSED A SECOND HELPING OF APPLE DUMPLINGS
THEN SHE BEGAN TO WALK SLOWLY
BUT THIS LAND WAS AN ENIGMA
THE MEN IN TOWN AT THE BANKS AND THE COUNTY OFFICES SEEM GLAD TO SEE ME
AS SHE LET IT FALL SHE CRIED IN DISTRESS OH EMIL WHY DID YOU I LIKE THAT THE BOY EXCLAIMED INDIGNANTLY
OSCAR SAT DOWN BUT LOU WALKED OVER TO THE WINDOW AND REMAINED STANDING HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM
THEY WERE NOT THE SORT OF LETTERS THAT A YOUNG MAN WRITES TO HIS SISTER
PERHAPS AS EMIL HAD NO SWEETHEART HE WOULD OBLIGE THE BOYS BY BLOWING OUT THE CANDLE
OH BUT LOU YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE HIM MAD
I HAVE MANY STRANGE BIRDS STOP WITH ME HERE
PEOPLE COME TO THEM AS PEOPLE GO TO A WARM FIRE IN WINTER
THE RABBITS RUN SHIVERING FROM ONE FROZEN GARDEN PATCH TO ANOTHER AND ARE HARD PUT TO IT TO FIND FROST-BITTEN CABBAGE-STALKS
SURE HE'S GETTIN ALONG FINE SAID MR SCHWARTZ CHEERFULLY
THERE'S SOMETHING IN KNOWING WHEN TO QUIT WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO LOU ANY PLACE WHERE THINGS WILL GROW SAID OSCAR GRIMLY
THE ROAD LED SOUTHWEST TOWARD THE STREAK OF PALE WATERY LIGHT THAT GLIMMERED IN THE LEADEN SKY
OLD IVAR HIS WHITE HEAD BARE STOOD HOLDING THE HORSES
HE HAD FIRST LEARNED OF HER MISFORTUNE FROM A SAN FRANCISCO PAPER FOUR WEEKS OLD WHICH HE HAD PICKED UP IN A SALOON AND WHICH CONTAINED A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF FRANK SHABATA'S TRIAL
IT DIVERTED HIM TO SPECULATE AS TO HOW MUCH WEIGHT EACH OF THE STEERS WOULD PROBABLY PUT ON BY SPRING
I ALWAYS LIKE DAT BOY FINE
THERE'S NO USE OF US TRYING TO STICK IT OUT JUST TO BE STUBBORN
FOR THAT MARIE WAS GRATEFUL TO HIM
THE WIND ANSWERED HIM LIKE AN ECHO HOO HOO-O-O-O-O-O ALEXANDRA DROVE OFF ALONE
PEOPLE SAY SOMETIMES HE RUNS ABOUT THE COUNTRY HOWLING AT NIGHT BECAUSE HE IS AFRAID THE LORD WILL DESTROY HIM
SHE HAD SELDOM FELT SO UTTERLY LONELY
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HIS MARE WAS FLYING OR RUNNING ON WHEELS LIKE A RAILWAY TRAIN
WHY ALEXANDRA YOU ARE FORTY YEARS OLD ALL THAT DOESN'T CONCERN ANYBODY BUT CARL AND ME
HE BOUGHT A NEW HEADER YOU KNOW BECAUSE ALL THE WHEAT'S SO SHORT THIS YEAR
BETTER PUT ON YOUR COAT ALEXANDRA
NO WE WON'T DO THAT ANY MORE ALL RIGHT EMIL ASSENTED
SHE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT IT
I WANT YOU BOYS TO GO DOWN YOURSELVES AND LOOK IT OVER
I HAVE NO BOY LEFT
YOU ARE TALKING NONSENSE
I'M SURE SHE'S A CLEVER LITTLE GIRL HE MURMURED LOOKING AT HER THOUGHTFULLY
I WANT TO GO DOWN TO THE CITY OF MEXICO TO JOIN ONE OF THE UNIVERSITY FELLOWS WHO'S AT THE HEAD OF AN ELECTRICAL PLANT
SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL--NOT TO SUFFER FRANK HAD BEEN WONT TO SEE HIMSELF IN DRAMATIC SITUATIONS
I FELT THAT YOU WERE PLEASED WITH ME IF YOU MEAN THAT AND YOU'VE FELT WHEN OTHER PEOPLE WERE PLEASED WITH YOU HE INSISTED
THERE WILL THOSE DO
IN A WHITE PATCH OF LIGHT WHERE THE MOON SHONE THROUGH THE BRANCHES A MAN'S HAND WAS PLUCKING SPASMODICALLY AT THE GRASS
AND THEN ALL AT ONCE IT WORKED ITSELF
IT'LL MAKE HIM A RICH MAN SOME DAY HE'S RICH NOW THAT'S WHY HE CAN TAKE A CHANCE WHY CAN'T WE
SHE FOUND HIM SITTING THERE WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM
WHY CARL IT IS SHE THREW OUT BOTH HER HANDS AND CAUGHT HIS ACROSS THE GATE
BESIDES THEY SAY HE CAN SMELL DEAD BIRDS
PERHAPS I AM LIKE CARRIE JENSEN THE SISTER OF ONE OF MY HIRED MEN
I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I FIRST THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PIANO MILLY AND THAT WAS WHEN YOU LEARNED THAT BOOK OF OLD SWEDISH SONGS THAT YOUR GRANDFATHER USED TO SING
IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE SOME ALLOWANCES
SUPPOSE I DO WILL MY LAND TO THEIR CHILDREN WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL THAT MAKE
THEY'VE DONE WELL HAVEN'T THEY YES VERY WELL
AS THE WEEKS WENT BY AND SHE HEARD NOTHING FROM HIM IT SEEMED TO ALEXANDRA THAT HER HEART GREW HARD AGAINST CARL
DON'T YOU GET LONELY SOMETIMES IN THE WINTER WHEN EVERYBODY HAS GONE AWAY I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SOMETIMES I GO UP TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WITH EMIL AND IT'S FUNNY TO SEE MARIE STANDING THERE LAUGHING AND SHAKING HANDS WITH PEOPLE LOOKING SO EXCITED AND GAY WITH FRANK SULKING BEHIND HER AS IF HE COULD EAT EVERYBODY ALIVE
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THEM AND THEY ALL WORE LONG BLACK COATS AND WHITE NECKTIES
I CAN REMEMBER GOING WITH MOTHER TO HEAR THEM SING
IF YOU GET DOWN-HEARTED WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE REST OF US ALEXANDRA ASKED
OF COURSE WE WANTED YOU TO
NEVER MIND
NEVER MIND
HER LIPS WERE PARTED A LITTLE
WHERE DID IT GO
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HIM
IVAR CAME RUNNING WITH HIS WHITE BAG AND THE MOMENT HE GOT TO HER SHE WAS QUIET AND LET HIM SAW HER HORN OFF AND DAUB THE PLACE WITH TAR EMIL HAD BEEN WATCHING HIS SISTER HIS FACE REFLECTING THE SUFFERINGS OF THE COW
WELL WHICH ARE THE LUCKY TREES
I KNOW PLENTY OF GROWN FOLKS THAT AIN'T HE SAID BLUNTLY
WHAT DO I WANT TO HANG AROUND HERE FOR
I KNIT THIS FOR HIM
SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE HOW MUCH THE COUNTRY MEANT TO HER
THE LAND SELLS FOR THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS THIS BUT IN FIVE YEARS WE WILL DOUBLE IT
HE SAYS THE RIGHT THING IS USUALLY JUST WHAT EVERYBODY DON'T DO
SHE WALKED BACK TO HER HOTEL UNREASONABLY COMFORTED
MILLY AND STELLA BOTH LOOKED THROUGH THE DOOR INTO THE SITTING-ROOM WHERE A CRAYON PORTRAIT OF JOHN BERGSON HUNG ON THE WALL
WHERE IS CARL LOU AND OSCAR MET US AND SAID THEY WANTED TO TALK TO HIM SO HE RODE OVER TO OSCAR'S WITH THEM
IS THAT WHAT I WORK MYSELF TO DEATH FOR DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT FRANK
PERHAPS THAT WAS WHY SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF EMIL
THAT'S THE WOMAN OF IT
WELL IVAR WHAT IS IT ALEXANDRA ASKED AFTER SHE HAD WAITED LONGER THAN USUAL
THE LIPS HAD ALREADY A LITTLE CURL OF BITTERNESS AND SKEPTICISM
WHEN THE TURQUOISE WENT TO MALVINA SAUVAGE THE FRENCH BANKER'S DAUGHTER MARIE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AND BETOOK HERSELF TO HER LITTLE TENT OF SHAWLS WHERE SHE BEGAN TO SHUFFLE HER CARDS BY THE LIGHT OF A TALLOW CANDLE CALLING OUT FORTUNES FORTUNES THE YOUNG PRIEST FATHER DUCHESNE WENT FIRST TO HAVE HIS FORTUNE READ
IT WAS THE FIRST WORD HE HAD HAD ALONE WITH HER FOR ALMOST A YEAR
WELL SAID ALEXANDRA FIRMLY I DO THE BEST I CAN ON MARIE'S ACCOUNT
HE SLIPPED INTO HIS EMPTY PLACE AT HIS SISTER'S RIGHT
THE SPARK OF HER LIFE WENT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND HE WAS ALWAYS WATCHING TO SURPRISE IT
THROUGHOUT THE MEAL THEY LOOKED DOWN AT THEIR PLATES AND DID NOT LIFT THEIR RED EYES
MISTRESS MISTRESS HE SOBBED IT HAS FALLEN
LET PEOPLE GO ON TALKING AS THEY LIKE AND WE WILL GO ON LIVING AS WE THINK BEST
ALEXANDRA SAT FINISHING HIS NEW NIGHTSHIRT THAT MUST GO IN THE TOP TRAY OF HIS TRUNK
WHAT'S HE SLOWING DOWN FOR
I'LL SPEAK TO MRS HILLER AGAIN
AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT SHE SAID BUT YOU WOULD NEVER ASK ME TO GO AWAY FOR GOOD WOULD YOU OF COURSE NOT MY DEAREST
WHEN ALL THE PEWS WERE FULL THE OLD MEN AND BOYS PACKED THE OPEN SPACE AT THE BACK OF THE CHURCH KNEELING ON THE FLOOR
HE HAD NOTHING AND THE OLD MAN WAS WILLING TO BUY THEM A PLACE AND SET THEM UP
THE FIRST WHEAT READY TO CUT ANYWHERE ABOUT HERE
SHE WEARS HER YELLOW HAIR IN A HIGH POMPADOUR AND IS BEDECKED WITH RINGS AND CHAINS AND BEAUTY PINS HER TIGHT HIGH-HEELED SHOES GIVE HER AN AWKWARD WALK AND SHE IS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS PREOCCUPIED WITH HER CLOTHES
SHE DID NOT HEAR HIM
THAT'S WHERE THE HAY IS SO FINE AND THE COYOTES CAN SCRATCH DOWN TO WATER AT NINE O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING ALEXANDRA PRESENTED HERSELF AT THE WARDEN'S OFFICE IN THE STATE PENITENTIARY
LET'S TRY TO DO LIKE THE SHREWD ONES AND NOT LIKE THESE STUPID FELLOWS
A GREAT WHITE TUB LIKE THE STONE WATER-TROUGHS IN THE OLD COUNTRY TO WASH THEMSELVES IN
HE STAYED AWAY FOR A WEEK OR TWO AND THEN CAME HOME AND WORKED LIKE A DEMON
BUT I CAN'T HELP FEELING SCARED WHEN I THINK HOW I WILL MISS YOU--MORE THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW SHE BRUSHED THE TEARS FROM HER CHEEKS NOT TRYING TO HIDE THEM
SHE LEANED HEAVILY ON HIS SHOULDER
PERHAPS HE GOT MORE SATISFACTION OUT OF FEELING HIMSELF ABUSED THAN HE WOULD HAVE GOT OUT OF BEING LOVED
THEY BECOME UNCLEAN LIKE THE HOGS IN THE BIBLE
HE SAT DOWN ON THE BOTTOM STEP OF THE BOX STAIRWAY AND TRIED TO GET HIS WITS TOGETHER
EVERY FEW MOMENTS A BOY WOULD COME RUNNING DOWN THE FLAGGED WALK AND DASH OUT INTO THE STREET AS IF HE WERE RUSHING TO ANNOUNCE SOME WONDER TO THE WORLD
VII MARIE'S FATHER ALBERT TOVESKY WAS ONE OF THE MORE INTELLIGENT BOHEMIANS WHO CAME WEST IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES
WOULD YOU RUN NO I'D BE TOO SCARED TO RUN EMIL ADMITTED MOURNFULLY TWISTING HIS FINGERS
AND ABOUT THE ORCHARD WHERE THE SNOW WAS FALLING AND PACKING CRUST OVER CRUST
AND LONGING ITSELF WAS HEAVY
NOW WHEN HE HAD AT LAST STRUGGLED OUT OF DEBT HE WAS GOING TO DIE HIMSELF
SHE WILL DO THE BEST SHE CAN
EMIL THREW HIMSELF DOWN BESIDE HER AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS
DON'T I KNOW THE LOOK OF OLD EVA SHABATA'S HANDS
THE BOYS PERSUADED CARL TO STAY FOR SUPPER AND GO SWIMMING IN THE PASTURE POND AFTER DARK
JUST AHEAD OF THEM WAS THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD WHERE THE GRASS HAD INDEED GROWN BACK OVER EVERYTHING SHAGGY AND RED HIDING EVEN THE WIRE FENCE
WHERE THERE WERE FLOWERS AND STREET BANDS EVERYWHERE AND CARRIAGES RATTLING UP AND DOWN AND WHERE THERE WAS A LITTLE BLIND BOOT-BLACK IN FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL WHO COULD PLAY ANY TUNE YOU ASKED FOR BY DROPPING THE LIDS OF BLACKING-BOXES ON THE STONE STEPS
SHE MUST HAVE STARTED UP AND GONE TOWARD THE HEDGE LEAVING A TRAIL OF BLOOD
THERE GO TO YOUR GRACEFUL
VI AT DINNER THAT DAY ALEXANDRA SAID SHE THOUGHT THEY MUST REALLY MANAGE TO GO OVER TO THE SHABATAS THAT AFTERNOON
ALEXANDRA TOO HAD RISEN EARLY THAT MORNING BECAUSE OF HER ANXIETY ABOUT EMIL
COME ALONG HE CALLED
SHE HAD FELT AS IF HER HEART WERE HIDING DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE WITH THE QUAIL AND THE PLOVER AND ALL THE LITTLE WILD THINGS THAT CROONED OR BUZZED IN THE SUN
WE WOUND OUR LADY UP EVERY NIGHT AND WHEN SHE BEGAN TO MOVE HER HEAD MY AUNT USED TO LAUGH AS HARD AS ANY OF US
YOU SEE WE HAVE KEPT UP THE OLD PATH CARL
THE DAY AFTER EMIL'S FUNERAL ALEXANDRA HAD WRITTEN TO CARL LINSTRUM
FOR THE FIRST TIME PERHAPS SINCE THAT LAND EMERGED FROM THE WATERS OF GEOLOGIC AGES A HUMAN FACE WAS SET TOWARD IT WITH LOVE AND YEARNING
WHEN HE WAS A BOY DRINKING OUT OF A CREEK HE SWALLOWED A SNAKE AND ALWAYS AFTER THAT HE COULD EAT ONLY SUCH FOOD AS THE CREATURE LIKED FOR WHEN HE ATE ANYTHING ELSE IT BECAME ENRAGED AND GNAWED HIM
I REALLY BUILT IT FOR EMIL
AT LAST EMIL SAID ABRUPTLY LOU AND OSCAR WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF THEY WERE POOR WOULDN'T THEY ALEXANDRA SMILED
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO SEND EMIL'S CHRISTMAS BOX IT OUGHT TO HAVE GONE BEFORE THIS
OUT TO SOME RAW PLACE MAYBE WHERE WE'D BE WORSE OFF THAN WE ARE HERE AND ALL TO DO OVER AGAIN
SUDDENLY AN OWL BEGAN TO HOOT OUT IN THE FIELDS
SIT ROUND AND CRY ALL DAY
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MARIE
IT HAD NEVER MORE THAN DIMLY OCCURRED TO FRANK THAT HE MADE HIS OWN UNHAPPINESS
SHE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL
BUT ALL THESE FELLOWS WHO ARE RUNNING OFF ARE BAD FARMERS LIKE POOR MR LINSTRUM
I THINK MYSELF IT IS MORE PLEASANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE CLEAN AND HEALTHY-LOOKING SHE ADMITTED BLANDLY
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT MOST OF MY GIRLS HAVE MARRIED MEN THEY WERE AFRAID OF
HER FACE HAS BECOME LONGER SHARPER MORE AGGRESSIVE
YOU MUST LEAVE ME HERE MUSTN'T YOU
HE BEST EXPRESSED HIS PREFERENCE FOR HIS WILD HOMESTEAD BY SAYING THAT HIS BIBLE SEEMED TRUER TO HIM THERE
THE AIR WAS COOL ENOUGH TO MAKE THE WARM SUN PLEASANT ON ONE'S BACK AND SHOULDERS AND SO CLEAR THAT THE EYE COULD FOLLOW A HAWK UP AND UP INTO THE BLAZING BLUE DEPTHS OF THE SKY
WE HAVE LAND ENOUGH AT LAST ALEXANDRA LAUGHED
I WISH WE COULD ALL GO WITH HIM AND LET THE GRASS GROW BACK OVER EVERYTHING CARL MADE NO REPLY
THE BOARD SIDEWALKS WERE GRAY WITH TRAMPLED SNOW BUT AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THE SHOPKEEPERS HAVING COME BACK FROM DINNER WERE KEEPING WELL BEHIND THEIR FROSTY WINDOWS
PEOPLE COULDN'T HELP LOVING HER
TO TAKE WHAT YOU WOULD GIVE ME I SHOULD HAVE TO BE EITHER A VERY LARGE MAN OR A VERY SMALL ONE AND I AM ONLY IN THE MIDDLE CLASS ALEXANDRA SIGHED
I MUST GO SOMEWHERE MUSTN'T I THE YOUNG MAN TOOK UP HIS SCYTHE AND LEANED ON IT
AND YOU AIN'T MARRIED YET
ALEXANDRA WENT INTO THE COOL WHITEWASHED BASEMENT WHERE THE WOMEN WERE SETTING THE TABLES
OLD MRS LEE HAD BEEN AFRAID THAT FAMILY MISUNDERSTANDINGS MIGHT DEPRIVE HER OF HER YEARLY VISIT TO ALEXANDRA
HERE HE IS
HE WAS A MAN OF POWERFUL BODY AND UNUSUAL ENDURANCE
ALEXANDRA HAD FOUND THAT SHE COULD OFTEN BREAK HIS FASTS AND LONG PENANCES BY TALKING TO HIM AND LETTING HIM POUR OUT THE THOUGHTS THAT TROUBLED HIM
A FEW TOUGH ZENIAS AND MARIGOLDS AND A ROW OF SCARLET SAGE BORE WITNESS TO THE BUCKETS OF WATER THAT MRS BERGSON HAD CARRIED THERE AFTER SUNDOWN AGAINST THE PROHIBITION OF HER SONS
I CAN'T TAKE ADVICE ON SUCH A MATTER
DO TALK TO ME
AGAIN--A MOAN--ANOTHER--SILENCE
A GOLDEN AFTERGLOW THROBBED IN THE WEST BUT THE COUNTRY ALREADY LOOKED EMPTY AND MOURNFUL
CARL DID NOT SAY ANYTHING BUT SHE FELT HIS SYMPATHY
BUT WHEN YOU MARRIED WE MADE A DIVISION OF THE LAND AND YOU WERE SATISFIED
THERE WAS OFTEN AN INTERESTING DISCONTENT IN HIS BLUE EYES AND EVERY BOHEMIAN GIRL HE MET IMAGINED HERSELF THE CAUSE OF THAT UNSATISFIED EXPRESSION
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THAT BOY
COULD YOU JUST WALK OFF AND LEAVE YOUR BUSINESS ALEXANDRA ASKED
HE DIDN'T LET YOU KNOW HE WAS COMING NO
IVAR UNSLUNG A HAMMOCK FROM A HOOK ON THE WALL
HIS SOFT LUSTROUS BLACK EYES HIS WHIMSICAL SMILE WOULD BE LESS AGAINST HIM IN THE KLONDIKE THAN ON THE DIVIDE
THEN THE POND IS FULL OF STRANGE VOICES EVERY NIGHT ALEXANDRA TRANSLATED FOR CARL WHO LOOKED THOUGHTFUL
THEY BOTH DID
YOU SAID I WAS BEING TAKEN IN THEN AND ALL THE NEIGHBORS SAID SO
BUT THE PLACE WAS AS CLEAN AS A CUPBOARD
THIS IS ALL VERY SPLENDID IN ITS WAY BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY WHEN IT WAS A WILD OLD BEAST THAT HAS HAUNTED ME ALL THESE YEARS
SHE MUST CERTAINLY SEE FRANK SHABATA
LIKE AN UNDERGROUND RIVER THAT CAME TO THE SURFACE ONLY HERE AND THERE AT INTERVALS MONTHS APART AND THEN SANK AGAIN TO FLOW ON UNDER HER OWN FIELDS
IT'S COLD UP THERE AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THOSE PATTERNS ARE
YOU WERE ONLY A LITTLE GIRL THEN BUT YOU KNEW EVER SO MUCH MORE ABOUT FARM WORK THAN POOR FATHER
THEY COULD NOT DOUBT THAT THAT INVISIBLE ARM WAS STILL ABOUT AMEDEE
COME BOYS IT'S CARL LINSTRUM OUR OLD CARL LOU GAVE THE VISITOR A QUICK SIDELONG GLANCE AND THRUST OUT HIS HAND
THEN HE FELL TO IMAGINING THAT HE LOOKED ONCE MORE AND FOUND IT THERE AND WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF SHE LOVED HIM,--SHE WHO AS ALEXANDRA SAID COULD GIVE HER WHOLE HEART
ONLY YOU MUST STOP CRYING OR I WON'T GO A STEP
THE DAWN IN THE EAST LOOKED LIKE THE LIGHT FROM SOME GREAT FIRE THAT WAS BURNING UNDER THE EDGE OF THE WORLD
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS ONE BEFORE HAVE I MRS LEE THE OLD WOMAN GIGGLED AND DUCKED HER HEAD
THEY WON'T LET HER WEAR NIGHTCAPS EITHER
MISCHANCE HUNG OVER IT
ISN'T THAT FAIR BARNEY THE IRISHMAN LAUGHED
EVER SINCE EMIL DIED I'VE SUFFERED SO WHEN IT RAINED
THROUGH THE DAY WHILE THE BAKING AND WASHING AND IRONING WERE GOING ON THE FATHER LAY AND LOOKED UP AT THE ROOF BEAMS THAT HE HIMSELF HAD HEWN OR OUT AT THE CATTLE IN THE CORRAL
SHE DOES PYROGRAPHY TOO
AND NOW THIS STORM HAS COME ON
THE TRIAL HAD LASTED ONLY THREE DAYS
IVAR'S HITCHING UP HE ADDED TURNING TO ANNIE
I WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IT COULD BE DONE
NOW GO AND PUT EMIL'S MARE TO THE CART
WE NEVER DOUBTED YOU ALEXANDRA
MARIE STOOD LOOKING TOWARD IT WISTFULLY HER HAND ON THE LID OF THE CHURN WHEN SHE HEARD A SHARP RING IN THE AIR THE MERRY SOUND OF THE WHETSTONE ON THE SCYTHE
THEY DID NOT MIND HARD WORK BUT THEY HATED EXPERIMENTS AND COULD NEVER SEE THE USE OF TAKING PAINS
ALMOST ANYTHING YOU CHOOSE AND THERE ARE SO MANY MANY THINGS I CAN'T DO EMIL ECHOED HER TONE SARCASTICALLY
OH IT WAS MY FAULT SAID ALEXANDRA EAGERLY
THE CHOIR WERE BUSY REHEARSING A MASS OF ROSSINI WHICH THEY HAD STUDIED AND PRACTISED FOR THIS OCCASION
THEY WERE HAVING SUCH A GOOD TIME AND WE'VE SPOILED IT ALL FOR THEM EMIL GAVE A RATHER SORE LAUGH
THEY WERE OLD FRIENDS OH EMIL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN MARIE TOSSED HER HEAD IMPATIENTLY
EMIL MOWED VIGOROUSLY AND MARIE SAT SUNNING HERSELF AND WATCHING THE LONG GRASS FALL
ALEXANDRA EXPLAINED HER PREDICAMENT AND THE BOY FOLLOWED HER TO THE CORNER WHERE EMIL STILL SAT BY THE POLE
KEEP TURNING THE LAND AND ALWAYS PUT UP MORE HAY THAN YOU NEED
WHEN FRANK BRAGS I SAY SHARP THINGS AND HE NEVER FORGETS
SHE HAD GROWN VERY PALE AND HER EYES WERE SHINING WITH EXCITEMENT AND DISTRESS
IT WAS HIS FATHER THAT KEPT BAPTISTE AWAKE
BY GOD
SHE HAD A WHITE FUR TIPPET ABOUT HER NECK AND MADE NO FUSSY OBJECTIONS WHEN EMIL FINGERED IT ADMIRINGLY
NOW THEY'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THIS HIGH LAND WASN'T NEVER MEANT TO GROW NOTHING ON AND EVERYBODY WHO AIN'T FIXED TO GRAZE CATTLE IS TRYING TO CRAWL OUT
WHEN I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR COMING I'VE SOMETIMES BEEN A LITTLE AFRAID OF IT
EVER SINCE SHE'S COME BACK SHE'S BEEN PERFECTLY CHEERFUL AND SHE SAYS SHE'S CONTENTED TO LIVE AND WORK IN A WORLD THAT'S SO BIG AND INTERESTING
A FEW FORECLOSURES DEMORALIZED THE COUNTY
WHILE THE LITTLE DRUMMER WAS DRINKING TO RECOVER HIS NERVE ALEXANDRA HURRIED TO THE DRUG STORE AS THE MOST LIKELY PLACE TO FIND CARL LINSTRUM
ALEXANDRA SIGHED
HIS STEAMER HAD BEEN HELD BACK TWO DAYS BY ROUGH WEATHER
SHE WAS ALMOST THROUGH WITH HER FIGURES WHEN SHE HEARD A CART DRIVE UP TO THE GATE AND LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW SHE SAW HER TWO OLDER BROTHERS
HIS BOYS WERE WILLING ENOUGH TO WORK BUT WHEN HE TALKED WITH THEM THEY USUALLY IRRITATED HIM
THEY STAYED WITH HER UNTIL THEY MARRIED AND WERE REPLACED BY SISTERS OR COUSINS FROM THE OLD COUNTRY
HE THRUST HIS HAND INTO THE POCKET OF HIS VELVET TROUSERS AND BROUGHT OUT A HANDFUL OF UNCUT TURQUOISES AS BIG AS MARBLES
AT LAST HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON THE OLD SLAT LOUNGE WHERE HE HAD SLEPT WHEN HE WAS LITTLE AND LAY LOOKING UP AT THE FAMILIAR CRACKS IN THE CEILING
THEY CAN ALWAYS SCRAPE ALONG DOWN THERE BUT THEY CAN NEVER DO ANYTHING BIG
WHEN CARL LINSTRUM CAME OVER IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDRA WINKED TO HIM AND POINTED TOWARD THE BARN
IF SHE WERE IN TROUBLE CERTAINLY HE WAS THE ONE PERSON IN THE WORLD SHE WOULD WANT TO SEE
WHAT TIME DID YOU GET OVER HERE
WHEN HE WAS AT HOME HE MADE HAMMOCKS OUT OF TWINE AND COMMITTED CHAPTERS OF THE BIBLE TO MEMORY
OF COURSE I DON'T
YOU ARE WASTING YOUR LIFE HERE
SHE SEEMS SUNNIER AND MORE VIGOROUS THAN SHE DID AS A YOUNG GIRL
I TRIED IT ALL MORNING IN THE DRUG-STORE CELLAR AND IT WORKED EVER SO WELL MAKES FINE BIG PICTURES WHAT ARE THEY ABOUT OH HUNTING PICTURES IN GERMANY AND ROBINSON CRUSOE AND FUNNY PICTURES ABOUT CANNIBALS
SHE HAD LIFTED HER HEAD TO HER LOVER'S BREAST TAKEN HIS HAND IN BOTH HER OWN AND BLED QUIETLY TO DEATH
LOOK AT PETER KRALIK
I LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE APPRECIATES HER MORE THAN YOU DO EMIL FROWNED
I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT DOCTORING SAID OSCAR SCORNFULLY
WE WILL ALL WORK THE PLACE TOGETHER AND YOU WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR SISTER BOYS AND BE GOOD BROTHERS TO HER AND GOOD SONS TO YOUR MOTHER
WHEN THE BERGSONS DROVE OVER THE HILL IVAR WAS SITTING IN THE DOORWAY OF HIS HOUSE READING THE NORWEGIAN BIBLE
I'VE HAD A PRETTY LONELY LIFE EMIL
ALEXANDRA AND CARL WALKED TOGETHER DOWN THE POTATO ROWS
THEY WERE CAUTIOUS AND RESERVED WITH EMIL BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN AWAY TO COLLEGE AND WERE PREPARED TO TAKE HIM DOWN IF HE SHOULD TRY TO PUT ON AIRS WITH THEM
AS SHE LINGERED BY THE SOUTH GATE SHE ACTUALLY DID ENCOUNTER ONE OF THE BOYS
ALEXANDRA WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH HER BROTHER
YOU HAVE LIVED WHERE THINGS MOVE SO FAST AND EVERYTHING IS SLOW HERE
I'M A FRESHIE JUST OFF THE FARM
IT FORTIFIED HER TO REFLECT UPON THE GREAT OPERATIONS OF NATURE AND WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF THE LAW THAT LAY BEHIND THEM SHE FELT A SENSE OF PERSONAL SECURITY
I CAN REMEMBER YOU A LITTLE MR LINSTRUM
I'M A GOOD CATHOLIC BUT I THINK I COULD GET ALONG WITH CARING FOR TREES IF I HADN'T ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S A POOR SAYING SAID EMIL STOOPING OVER TO WIPE HIS HANDS IN THE WET GRASS
I'LL SEND IVAR OVER WITH THE COWS IN THE MORNING SIGNA HESITATED AND LOOKED PERPLEXED
SICK
POOR OLD MRS LEE
WHEN HE PUT DOWN THE PAPER HE HAD ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE COULD REACH ALEXANDRA AS QUICKLY AS A LETTER COULD
EMIL STOOD DEFIANT GAZING DOWN AT HER
I HAVEN'T THE HEART TO TAKE YOU AWAY FROM HIM ANGELIQUE CLUNG TO HER HUSBAND AND MADE FACES AT EMIL OVER THE WHITE SHOULDER OF AMEDEE'S BALL-SHIRT
I SHOULDN'T THINK YOU'D WANT TO REMIND US HOW HARD YOU WERE ON US ALEXANDRA AFTER THE WAY YOU BABY EMIL HARD ON YOU
BUT WHEN WE GOT HOME MY AUNT SCOLDED HIM FOR BUYING TOYS WHEN SHE NEEDED SO MANY THINGS
MARIA-A-A SHE CALLED
I NEVER HATE MY WIFE BUT DAT WOMAN WHAT MAKE ME DO DAT--HONEST TO GOD BUT I HATE HER
I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THEM YET BUT THERE'LL BE SURE TO BE SOME OF THEM AROUND THE LIBRARY
I HOPE YOU BOYS NEVER SHOOT WILD BIRDS LOU AND OSCAR GRINNED AND IVAR SHOOK HIS BUSHY HEAD
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE CORNER WHERE THE PASTURES JOINED ALEXANDRA'S TWELVE YOUNG COLTS WERE GALLOPING IN A DROVE OVER THE BROW OF THE HILL
BUT IF YOU CAN GET HIM ON A CLEAR DAY YOU CAN LEARN A GREAT DEAL FROM HIM
EMIL WAS MAKING RABBIT TRAPS IN THE KITCHEN SHED
BE CAREFUL DON'T LET ANY ONE SEE THEM
WASN'T SHE SPLENDID
LOOKING UP HE RECOGNIZED THE BERGSONS TEAM WITH TWO SEATS IN THE WAGON WHICH MEANT THEY WERE OFF FOR A PLEASURE EXCURSION
IV FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS AFTER JOHN BERGSON'S DEATH THE AFFAIRS OF HIS FAMILY PROSPERED
WE WORKED IN THE FIELDS TO PAY FOR THE FIRST LAND YOU BOUGHT AND WHATEVER'S COME OUT OF IT HAS GOT TO BE KEPT IN THE FAMILY OSCAR REINFORCED HIS BROTHER HIS MIND FIXED ON THE ONE POINT HE COULD SEE
ALEXANDRA DREW BACK PERPLEXED AND HURT
CARL AND EMIL WENT UP TO THE CATHOLIC FAIR FOR A FEW MOMENTS NEITHER OF THE MEN SPOKE
GOOD-NIGHT SISTER
AND IT'S WHAT GOES ON IN THE WORLD THAT RECONCILES ME V ALEXANDRA DID NOT FIND TIME TO GO TO HER NEIGHBOR'S THE NEXT DAY NOR THE NEXT
FRANK DROPPED HIS GUN AND RAN BACK ALONG THE PATH SHAKING STUMBLING GASPING
YES MISTRESS I SHALL NOT TROUBLE YOU WITH THEIR TALK AGAIN
BUT HE SAYS FATHER CAN'T GET BETTER
ALL THE GIRLS WHO HAVE STANDS ARE GOING TO WEAR FANCY COSTUMES SHE ARGUED AND SOME OF THE BOYS
THE ORCHARD WAS RIDDLED AND SHOT WITH GOLD
I FELT THAT AS SOON AS YOU CAME I WONDER WHY YOU FEEL LIKE THAT CARL MUSED
YOU BETTER GO GET YOUR THINGS ON
DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN WAS A ROW OF GOOSEBERRY AND CURRANT BUSHES
WE PAY A HIGH RENT TOO THOUGH WE PAY DIFFERENTLY
THEY NEVER GET ANYWHERE
THE TABLE WAS SET FOR COMPANY IN THE DINING-ROOM WHERE HIGHLY VARNISHED WOOD AND COLORED GLASS AND USELESS PIECES OF CHINA WERE CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE STANDARDS OF THE NEW PROSPERITY
HE WROTE A FINE REGULAR HAND ALMOST LIKE ENGRAVING
THEY WERE BOTH THE BEST YOU HAD HERE THE SUN WAS DROPPING LOW IN THE WEST WHEN THE TWO FRIENDS ROSE AND TOOK THE PATH AGAIN
I'M AWFUL GLAD IT'S A BOY SURE ENOUGH THE YOUNG MEN CROWDED ROUND EMIL TO ADMIRE HIS COSTUME AND TO TELL HIM IN A BREATH EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE HE WENT AWAY
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF O PIONEERS BY WILLA CATHER
IS THAT WHY SO MANY COME HE ASKED
THIS CREEK GAVE A SORT OF IDENTITY TO THE FARMS THAT BORDERED UPON IT
I TELL YOU I NOT THAT KIND-A MAN
AFTER A FINAL SWISH EMIL SNAPPED THE GATE AND SPRANG INTO THE CART HOLDING HIS SCYTHE WELL OUT OVER THE WHEEL
THIS IS WHAT COMES OF LETTING A WOMAN MEDDLE IN BUSINESS HE SAID BITTERLY
THE CEDARS OF LEBANON WHICH HE HATH PLANTED
ONLY A HAPPY FEW
SHE WANTED TO LIVE AND DREAM--A HUNDRED YEARS FOREVER
IT NEVER SEEMS TO MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE WHETHER IT IS ME OR RAOUL MARCEL OR JAN SMIRKA
YOU LOOK LIKE A DROWNED WOMAN
WAIT UNTIL THEY COME IN
THEY BELTED THEMSELVES UP AND RAOUL MARCEL THE CHOIR TENOR AND FATHER DUCHESNE'S PET AND JEAN BORDELAU HELD THE STRING OVER WHICH THEY VAULTED
NO LESS THAN A DOZEN PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIMSELF TAKEN IN A DOZEN DIFFERENT LOVE-LORN ATTITUDES
MILLY NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF IVAR
WHEN EMIL REACHED THE LOWER CORNER BY THE HEDGE MARIE WAS SITTING UNDER HER WHITE MULBERRY TREE THE PAILFUL OF CHERRIES BESIDE HER LOOKING OFF AT THE GENTLE TIRELESS SWELLING OF THE WHEAT
AND SHE TURNED HER HEAD BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS OH YES
NO CARL
SHE SAT LOOKING AT THE SILVER SPOT THE MOON MADE ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND DOWN IN THE PASTURE
HE HAD NOT GONE FAR HOWEVER WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON ABROAD
WHILE SHE AND ALEXANDRA PATCHED AND PIECED AND QUILTED SHE TALKED INCESSANTLY ABOUT STORIES SHE READ IN A SWEDISH FAMILY PAPER TELLING THE PLOTS IN GREAT DETAIL
HE THOUGHT OF HIS ALEXANDRA'S STRONG ONES
ONLY MARIE IN HER LITTLE TENT OF SHAWLS WAS PALE AND QUIET
THEY FELT THAT ALEXANDRA HAD TAKEN AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE IN TURNING THEIR MOTHER LOOSE ON THEM
YOU COME AN SEE HE POUNDED EMIL'S RIBS TO EMPHASIZE EACH ANNOUNCEMENT
BUT HE IS MY BOY AND HE IS TENDER-HEARTED THAT NIGHT WHEN THE BOYS WERE CALLED TO SUPPER THEY SAT DOWN MOODILY
BUT WHY HAD HE LEFT HIS HORSE
BERTIE WHEN 1037 IS BROUGHT IN YOU JUST STEP OUT AND GIVE THIS LADY A CHANCE TO TALK THE YOUNG MAN BOWED HIS HEAD AND BENT OVER HIS LEDGER AGAIN
MRS BERGSON WAS A FAIR-SKINNED CORPULENT WOMAN HEAVY AND PLACID LIKE HER SON OSCAR BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING COMFORTABLE ABOUT HER
HAVE YOU SEEN THE DOCTOR YES
I DIDN'T WHEN WE MILKED TOGETHER
I THINK I WAS THE ONE WHO SUGGESTED OUR RUNNING AWAY
THEY THINK I AM TRYING TO FOOL THEM
HIS YELLOW CANVAS LEGGINGS AND KHAKI TROUSERS WERE SPLASHED TO THE KNEES
WHEN EMIL FINISHED HIS ACCOUNT,--BLOODY ENOUGH TO SATISFY MRS XAVIER AND TO MAKE HER FEEL THANKFUL THAT SHE WAS NOT A MATADOR,--MARIE BROKE OUT WITH A VOLLEY OF QUESTIONS
HE WON'T MIND THEM I DON'T KNOW
THEY STILL JAW ABOUT IT IN HISTORY CLASSES WE'D DO IT RIGHT OVER AGAIN MOST OF US SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN HOTLY
ARE YOU THE LEAST BIT DISAPPOINTED IN OUR COMING TOGETHER AGAIN HE ASKED ABRUPTLY
HE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SOVEREIGN VIRTUE IN MERE BODILY TOIL AND HE RATHER LIKED TO DO THINGS IN THE HARDEST WAY
PROBABLY SHE HAD MET THE SMIRKA BOY TOO DOWN THERE IN THE ORCHARD
ONCE THEY WERE ON THE HOMEWARD ROAD THE BOYS FORGOT THEIR ILL-HUMOR AND JOKED ABOUT IVAR AND HIS BIRDS
IT IS ALWAYS EASIER TO LOSE THAN TO FIND
THEN LOU WAS AFRAID WE LOOKED FOOLISH STANDING OUTSIDE IN THE PASTURE SO WE WENT BACK TO HANOVER FEELING VERY SAD
LIKE THE LARKS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE BEEN SINGING THE SAME FIVE NOTES OVER FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS OH YES
OH WE'VE ONLY BEGUN
THEY HAVE SIMPLY AS ALEXANDRA SAID OF THEM LONG AGO GROWN TO BE MORE AND MORE LIKE THEMSELVES
AND HE WAS GOING AWAY AGAIN YOU TELL ME THOUGH HE HAD ONLY BEEN HOME THREE WEEKS
AND I DO NOT KNOW WHY
ANOTHER SUMMER HE LOST HIS HOGS FROM CHOLERA AND A VALUABLE STALLION DIED FROM A RATTLESNAKE BITE
THEN THEY FALL BACK AND THE WEDGE SPLITS A LITTLE WHILE THE REAR ONES COME UP THE MIDDLE TO THE FRONT
DID YOU PLANT THOSE TOO
A FEW DAYS
EMIL WENT TO HER DOOR
WE'VE LIKED THE SAME THINGS AND WE'VE LIKED THEM TOGETHER WITHOUT ANYBODY ELSE KNOWING
CAN I SEE YOU FOR A MINUTE HE ASKED
NEVERTHELESS THE UNDERGROUND STREAM WAS THERE AND IT WAS BECAUSE SHE HAD SO MUCH PERSONALITY TO PUT INTO HER ENTERPRISES AND SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING IT INTO THEM SO COMPLETELY THAT HER AFFAIRS PROSPERED BETTER THAN THOSE OF HER NEIGHBORS
THEIR FATHER LOOKED AT THEM SEARCHINGLY THOUGH IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE THEIR FACES
SO WHEN THEY FILL IT UP AND SEND HER IN THERE SHE PRETENDS AND MAKES A SPLASHING NOISE
WHEN YOU GET SO NEAR THE DEAD THEY SEEM MORE REAL THAN THE LIVING
THE PEOPLE SLOWEST OF ALL
IT NEEDS MOWING NOW
WE REALIZE YOU WERE A GREAT DEAL OF HELP TO US
TIME AND AGAIN HIS CROPS HAD FAILED
ONLY DON'T COME TO ME AGAIN TELLING ME WHAT PEOPLE SAY
YOU HIGH-STRUNG BOHEMIAN CAN'T UNDERSTAND US
SHE KNEW THAT CARL WAS AWAY FROM POST-OFFICES PROSPECTING SOMEWHERE IN THE INTERIOR
BUT ONCE OUT AMONG THE WHEATFIELDS IN THE MORNING SUN THEIR HORSES AND THEIR OWN YOUTH GOT THE BETTER OF THEM
ON MY HONOR MARIE IF YOU WILL SAY YOU LOVE ME I WILL GO AWAY SHE LIFTED HER FACE TO HIS
BEHIND HER THE FIREFLIES WERE WEAVING IN AND OUT OVER THE WHEAT
ALEXANDRA ALL THE WAY OUT FROM NEW YORK I'VE BEEN PLANNING HOW I COULD DECEIVE YOU AND MAKE YOU THINK ME A VERY ENVIABLE FELLOW AND HERE I AM TELLING YOU THE TRUTH THE FIRST NIGHT
IVAR HAD EXPLAINED HIS CHOICE BY SAYING THAT THE FEWER NEIGHBORS HE HAD THE FEWER TEMPTATIONS
WELL WHAT DO FOLKS IN NEW YORK THINK OF WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN LOU BEGAN TO BLUSTER AS HE ALWAYS DID WHEN HE TALKED POLITICS
I THOUGHT WHEN I CAME OUT OF THAT PRISON WHERE POOR FRANK IS THAT I SHOULD NEVER FEEL FREE AGAIN
THEN SHE STOPPED SHORT AND STOOPED DOWN TO WIPE HIS WET FACE
THEY SAY WHEN HORSES HAVE DISTEMPER HE TAKES THE MEDICINE HIMSELF AND THEN PRAYS OVER THE HORSES ALEXANDRA SPOKE UP
HE WAS NOT VERY SANGUINE ABOUT HIS FUTURE
IN HIS DAUGHTER JOHN BERGSON RECOGNIZED THE STRENGTH OF WILL AND THE SIMPLE DIRECT WAY OF THINKING THINGS OUT THAT HAD CHARACTERIZED HIS FATHER IN HIS BETTER DAYS
IT WAS LIKE THAT WHEN ALEXANDRA TESTED HER SEED-CORN IN THE SPRING HE MUSED
IT LOOKS BAD FOR HIM TO BE HANGING ON TO A WOMAN THIS WAY
SO DO I
AS SHE GREW OLDER THIS FANCY MORE OFTEN CAME TO HER WHEN SHE WAS TIRED THAN WHEN SHE WAS FRESH AND STRONG
I YUST-A TA-ANK YOU LIKE DIS MARIE RAN TO THE DOOR AGAIN
POOR AMEDEE'S ILLNESS HAD TAKEN ON A NEW MEANING TO HER NOW THAT SHE KNEW EMIL HAD BEEN WITH HIM
A DISGUST OF LIFE WEIGHED UPON HER HEART
THE BROKEN FOOD THE BITS OF BROKEN CHINA THE OLD WASH-BOILERS AND TEA-KETTLES THROWN INTO THE SUNFLOWER PATCH
MOST BOHEMIANS ARE GOOD-NATURED BUT FRANK THINKS WE DON'T APPRECIATE HIM HERE I GUESS
AS THEY DROVE AWAY MARIE TURNED AND WENT SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE
SHE TOOK UP HER WORKBASKET AND WAITED FOR HIM TO SPEAK
HE IS A DISGRACEFUL OBJECT AND YOU'RE FIXED UP SO NICE NOW
THE LAND DID IT
EMIL'S COLD FROWNING FACE THE GIRL'S CONTENT--ALEXANDRA HAD FELT AWE OF THEM EVEN IN THE FIRST SHOCK OF HER GRIEF
ONE OF THE GOULDS WAS GETTING A DIVORCE AND FRANK TOOK IT AS A PERSONAL AFFRONT
THE DOCTORS WOULD HAVE US ALL CRAZY IF THEY COULD
TAILORS LOCKSMITHS JOINERS CIGAR-MAKERS ETC
YOU KNOW THAT MY SPELLS COME FROM GOD AND THAT I WOULD NOT HARM ANY LIVING CREATURE
HIS CHEEKS WERE BROWNER AND FULLER
OH THERE'S A GOOD BOY SHE TURNED HER HEAD TO HIM WITH A QUICK BRIGHT SMILE
EMIL HAD RETURNED ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HIS SISTER WAS SO PROUD OF HIM THAT SHE DECIDED AT ONCE TO TAKE HIM UP TO THE CHURCH SUPPER AND TO MAKE HIM WEAR THE MEXICAN COSTUME HE HAD BROUGHT HOME IN HIS TRUNK
THERE WAS A SHARP CRACK FROM THE GUN AND FIVE OF THE BIRDS FELL TO THE GROUND
X WHILE EMIL AND CARL WERE AMUSING THEMSELVES AT THE FAIR ALEXANDRA WAS AT HOME BUSY WITH HER ACCOUNT-BOOKS WHICH HAD BEEN NEGLECTED OF LATE
IT'S BAD IF ALL THE MEMBERS OF A FAMILY THINK ALIKE
SOUNDS OF LAUGHTER AND SPLASHING CAME UP FROM THE PASTURE AND WHEN THE MOON ROSE RAPIDLY ABOVE THE BARE RIM OF THE PRAIRIE THE POND GLITTERED LIKE POLISHED METAL AND SHE COULD SEE THE FLASH OF WHITE BODIES AS THE BOYS RAN ABOUT THE EDGE OR JUMPED INTO THE WATER
SHE HAD ASKED THEM FOR THAT DAY BECAUSE EMIL WHO HATED FAMILY PARTIES WOULD BE ABSENT DANCING AT AMEDEE CHEVALIER'S WEDDING UP IN THE FRENCH COUNTRY
AN OWL WAS HOOTING SOMEWHERE IN THE FIELDS
THE THREE PRETTY YOUNG SWEDISH GIRLS WHO DID ALEXANDRA'S HOUSEWORK WERE CUTTING PIES REFILLING COFFEECUPS PLACING PLATTERS OF BREAD AND MEAT AND POTATOES UPON THE RED TABLECLOTH AND CONTINUALLY GETTING IN EACH OTHER'S WAY BETWEEN THE TABLE AND THE STOVE
THEN THE GENIUS OF THE DIVIDE THE GREAT FREE SPIRIT WHICH BREATHES ACROSS IT MUST HAVE BENT LOWER THAN IT EVER BENT TO A HUMAN WILL BEFORE
THEN JUST BEFORE SHE WENT TO SLEEP SHE HAD THE OLD SENSATION OF BEING LIFTED AND CARRIED BY A STRONG BEING WHO TOOK FROM HER ALL HER BODILY WEARINESS
WHY I REMEMBER YOU CRIED LOU WHEN WE PUT IN THE FIRST BIG WHEAT-PLANTING AND SAID EVERYBODY WAS LAUGHING AT US LOU TURNED TO OSCAR
THE YOUNG PEOPLE DRIFTED TO THE OTHER END OF THE HALL WHERE THE GUITAR WAS SOUNDING
IVAR HAD NEVER LEARNED TO SPEAK ENGLISH AND HIS NORWEGIAN WAS QUAINT AND GRAVE LIKE THE SPEECH OF THE MORE OLD-FASHIONED PEOPLE
I WANT TO HOLD ON HARDER THAN EVER AND WHEN YOU'RE A MAN YOU'LL THANK ME SHE URGED BRIGHAM FORWARD
HE'S BUYING AND TRADING FOR EVERY BIT OF LAND HE CAN GET UP HERE
HER FIGURE IS FULLER AND SHE HAS MORE COLOR
AGAIN THE MURMUR LIKE WATER WELLING OUT OF THE GROUND
WHEN SHE GOT HOME THAT EVENING SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO HER FATHER'S ROOM AND TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO SHABATA
HE GOES OVER LIKE A BIRD AND YOU HAVE TO HUMP YOURSELF ALL UP OH I DO DO I EMIL CAUGHT HER AND KISSED HER SAUCY MOUTH SQUARELY WHILE SHE LAUGHED AND STRUGGLED AND CALLED MEDEE
SHE DROVE TO THE LINDELL HOTEL WHERE SHE HAD STAYED TWO YEARS AGO WHEN SHE CAME UP FOR EMIL'S COMMENCEMENT
HE BEGINS TO CUT HIS WHEAT TO-DAY
AND NOW ALEXANDRA WIPED HER EYES WITH THE CORNER OF HER APRON AND NOW I MUST REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE GOING WHERE YOU WILL HAVE MANY FRIENDS AND WILL FIND THE WORK YOU WERE MEANT TO DO
THERE IS OFTEN A GOOD DEAL OF THE CHILD LEFT IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD TO GROW UP TOO SOON
THEY HAD MADE AN EARLY START ONE MORNING AND HAD DRIVEN A LONG WAY BEFORE NOON
THEY HAD LEFT THE LAGOONS AND THE RED GRASS BEHIND THEM
SHE SAID FRANKLY THAT SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT SUCH THINGS AND SHE WAS WILLING TO BE GOVERNED BY THE GENERAL CONVICTION THAT THE MORE USELESS AND UTTERLY UNUSABLE OBJECTS WERE THE GREATER THEIR VIRTUE AS ORNAMENT
HIS PALE FACE WAS AS BARE AS AN EGG AND HIS WHITE EYEBROWS GAVE IT AN EMPTY LOOK
THE GRAIN IS SO HEAVY THAT IT BENDS TOWARD THE BLADE AND CUTS LIKE VELVET
SHE LOOKED LIKE HER GRANDMOTHER BERGSON AND HAD HER COMFORTABLE AND COMFORT-LOVING NATURE
SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO ONE OF US OR TO BOTH
ONCE THERE SHE SEEMED NOT TO HAVE STRUGGLED ANY MORE
FATHER WASN'T A BIT LIKE LOU OR OSCAR WAS HE
NELSE JENSEN SIGNA'S GLOOMY SUITOR HAD HIS WORD
BOYS GONE TO TOWN HE ASKED AS HE SANK DOWN ON THE WARM SUN-BAKED EARTH
YES SHE SAID IF HE COULD HAVE SEEN ALL THAT WOULD COME OF THE TASK HE GAVE ME HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER ORGAN
BUT DON'T YOU SORT OF HATE TO HAVE PEOPLE SEE HIM AROUND HERE ALEXANDRA SHE WENT ON WITH PERSUASIVE SMOOTHNESS
HIS SHAGGY HEAD IS SCARCELY WHITER THAN IT WAS SIXTEEN YEARS AGO BUT HIS LITTLE BLUE EYES HAVE BECOME PALE AND WATERY AND HIS RUDDY FACE IS WITHERED LIKE AN APPLE THAT HAS CLUNG ALL WINTER TO THE TREE
MARIE CROSSED THE FENCE AT THE WHEATFIELD CORNER AND WALKED SLOWLY ALONG THE PATH THAT LED TO ALEXANDRA'S
YOUR UNCLE BOUGHT YOU SOME KIND OF A MECHANICAL TOY A TURKISH LADY SITTING ON AN OTTOMAN AND SMOKING A HOOKAH WASN'T IT
THEY ARE MUCH ANGRIER WITH ME ABOUT EMIL NOW THAN ABOUT YOU
THE COUNTRY PARISHIONERS WERE STAYING IN TOWN FOR DINNER AND NEARLY EVERY HOUSE IN SAINTE-AGNES ENTERTAINED VISITORS THAT DAY
THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO FUSS ABOUT EMIL SAID HIS SISTER SLOWLY YOU OUGHT NOT TO TAKE THINGS FOR GRANTED
I GUESS PEOPLE ALWAYS GET WHAT'S HARDEST FOR THEM ALEXANDRA MARIE GATHERED THE SHAWL CLOSER ABOUT HER AND STILL LOOKED HARD AT THE CANE
BUT WHAT HAVE YOU FELLOWS OUT HERE GOT TO KICK ABOUT
LET ME PUT IT OFF ANOTHER YEAR
HE SEEMED TO DISCOVER THAT THERE WAS A KIND OF RAPTURE IN WHICH HE COULD LOVE FOREVER WITHOUT FALTERING AND WITHOUT SIN
SO FAR JOHN HAD NOT ATTEMPTED TO CULTIVATE THE SECOND HALF-SECTION BUT USED IT FOR PASTURE LAND AND ONE OF HIS SONS RODE HERD THERE IN OPEN WEATHER
FROM MY YOUTH UP I HAVE HAD A STRONG REBELLIOUS BODY AND HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO EVERY KIND OF TEMPTATION
EVER DONE ANYTHING IN THAT LINE BEFORE NO BUT I'M GOING TO JOIN A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WENT OUT FROM NEW YORK AND HAS DONE WELL
AFTER A FEW WORDS WITH MR SCHWARTZ SHE LEFT THE PRISON AND MADE HER WAY TO THE STREET-CAR
THE STREET DOESN'T MATTER
HE HEARD OF SOMEBODY LOST FOUR HEAD OF HORSES FEEDIN EM THAT STUFF ALEXANDRA LOOKED DOWN THE TABLE FROM ONE TO ANOTHER
IT SEEMED TO HER MOST UNNATURAL THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE COME
IN THE CART SAT A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WORE DRIVING GAUNTLETS AND A WIDE SHADE HAT TRIMMED WITH RED POPPIES
UP AND COMING ON THE DIVIDE EH ALEXANDRA HE CRIED GAYLY
PUT ON THE HAT PLEASE
ALWAYS SO PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES
BUT IF YOU SAW THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG YOU OUGHT TO HAVE TOLD ME CARL CARL TOOK HER HAND AND SMILED PATIENTLY
FRANK'S NOT A BAD NEIGHBOR BUT TO GET ON WITH HIM YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A FUSS OVER HIM AND ACT AS IF YOU THOUGHT HE WAS A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON ALL THE TIME AND DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE
SHOLTE THE FAT RUSSIAN BOY WHO LIVED FOR HIS STOMACH WAS TO BE DISAPPOINTED IN LOVE GROW THIN AND SHOOT HIMSELF FROM DESPONDENCY
BREAKS YOUR BACK
IF I HADN'T HAD COMPANY I'D HAVE RUN OVER TO SEE FOR MYSELF
CHRIS ARNSON HAS TRADED HIS HALF-SECTION FOR A PLACE DOWN ON THE RIVER WHO DID HE TRADE WITH CHARLEY FULLER IN TOWN FULLER THE REAL ESTATE MAN
THE CART STOPPED AT THE GATE AND A MERRY CONTRALTO VOICE CALLED ALMOST THROUGH EMIL HE DROPPED HIS SCYTHE AND WENT TOWARD THE FENCE WIPING HIS FACE AND NECK WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF
I'M DISAPPOINTED IN MY OWN EYE IN MY IMAGINATION AT THIS MOMENT LOU AND OSCAR CAME UP THE HILL FROM THE ORCHARD
WOULD HAVE DESTROYED IT IF HE HAD FOUND IT AS HEROD SLEW THE INNOCENTS AS ROME SLEW THE MARTYRS
A MARRIED MAN DON'T LOSE HIS HEAD NO MORE HE SLAPPED EMIL ON THE BACK AS HE CAUGHT STEP WITH HIM
LITTLE SHRIEKS AND CURRENTS OF SOFT LAUGHTER RAN UP AND DOWN THE DARK HALL
WE BORROW THE MONEY FOR SIX YEARS
HE WAS AFRAID TO STOP ANY ONE AFRAID TO GO INTO THE STORE AND ASK FOR HELP SO HE SAT WRINGING HIS LONG SLEEVES AND LOOKING UP A TELEGRAPH POLE BESIDE HIM WHIMPERING MY KITTEN OH MY KITTEN
IT WAS SIGNA WRAPPED IN A MAN'S OVERCOAT AND WEARING A PAIR OF BOOTS OVER HER SHOES
SHALL WAIT HERE UNTIL YOU COME
I SENT THEM TO REMIND YOU OF ME NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE GOOD
AT NIGHT THE COYOTES ROAM THE WINTRY WASTE HOWLING FOR FOOD
BUT I FIND I CAN'T WHAT GOOD COMES OF OFFERING PEOPLE THINGS THEY DON'T NEED ALEXANDRA ASKED SADLY
WHEN FRANK TOOK UP HIS GUN AND WALKED OUT OF THE HOUSE HE HAD NOT THE FAINTEST PURPOSE OF DOING ANYTHING WITH IT
IT'S A BAD ROAD TO YOUR PLACE YES YES IT IS THE OLD MAN SCRAMBLED ABOUT AND BEGAN TO LOOSE THE TUGS
I WAS GLAD TO COME BACK TO IT
DO THE BIRDS KNOW YOU WILL BE KIND TO THEM IVAR
IF HE COULD CATCH THE ONE O'CLOCK TRAIN HE HAD MONEY ENOUGH TO GET AS FAR AS OMAHA
I'M IN IT ONLY BECAUSE HE TOOK ME IN
WHY DID SHE CARE ABOUT ANY ONE BUT HIM
ALEXANDRA DID NOT TALK MUCH AT THE TABLE BUT SHE ENCOURAGED HER MEN TO TALK AND SHE ALWAYS LISTENED ATTENTIVELY EVEN WHEN THEY SEEMED TO BE TALKING FOOLISHLY
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS ALEXANDRA SHOOK HER FINGER AT HIM
THE GUN WAS OF COURSE AGAINST HIM AND THE JUDGE HAD GIVEN HIM THE FULL SENTENCE,--TEN YEARS
BUT CAN'T SHE WALK
ALTHOUGH IT WAS ONLY FOUR O'CLOCK THE WINTER DAY WAS FADING
THE LIGHT STEEL WINDMILLS TREMBLE THROUGHOUT THEIR FRAMES AND TUG AT THEIR MOORINGS AS THEY VIBRATE IN THE WIND THAT OFTEN BLOWS FROM ONE WEEK'S END TO ANOTHER ACROSS THAT HIGH ACTIVE RESOLUTE STRETCH OF COUNTRY
IT MIGHT BE THE LAST TIME THAT HE WOULD SEE HER ALONE AND TODAY HE COULD LEAVE HER WITHOUT RANCOR WITHOUT BITTERNESS
THEY ADVANCED DISTRUSTFULLY AND AS IF THEY WISHED THE DISTANCE WERE LONGER
BLESS HER LITTLE HEART
SPLOTCHES OF WILD LARKSPUR PALE GREEN-AND-WHITE SPIKES OF HOARHOUND PLANTATIONS OF WILD COTTON TANGLES OF FOXTAIL AND WILD WHEAT
CANDY AND LITTLE PIGS AND SPOTTED CALVES
WHEN I PUT IN OUR FIRST FIELD OF ALFALFA YOU BOTH OPPOSED ME JUST BECAUSE I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT FROM A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN TO THE UNIVERSITY
AND I'LL BE WORKING FOR YOU AS MUCH AS FOR MYSELF ALEXANDRA
SOMEHOW IT WILL TAKE MORE COURAGE TO BEAR YOUR GOING THAN EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE CARL LOOKED AT THE GROUND
THAT BOY HE COME INTO THIS WORLD LAUGHIN AND HE BEEN LAUGHIN EVER SINCE
I'M A FOOL HERE BUT I KNOW I CAN DO SOMETHING HE SAT UP AND FROWNED AT THE RED GRASS
YOU'D BETTER SEND HIM YOURSELF AND NOT HAVE ANY HARD FEELINGS ALEXANDRA HELPED ONE OF HER LITTLE NEPHEWS TO GRAVY
IT'S JUST THE SAME MARIE HAD OFTEN WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS ANYONE ELSE WHO COULD LOOK HIS THOUGHTS TO YOU AS EMIL COULD
WAS SHE TOO UNHAPPY TO FIND COMFORT EVEN HERE
THE BOYS WITH ONE ACCORD LOOKED AWAY FROM OLD PIERRE TO THE RED CHURCH ON THE HILL WITH THE GOLD CROSS FLAMING ON ITS STEEPLE
EMIL HAD JUST COME HOME WORN OUT AND SICK HIMSELF
YOU REMEMBER HOW HOMESICK I USED TO GET AND WHAT LONG TALKS WE USED TO HAVE COMING FROM SCHOOL
DON'T DO ANYTHING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO OSCAR SHE WHISPERED
I WOULD HAVE MY OWN WAY
SIT DOWN A MOMENT I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING MARIE SAT DOWN ON THE TOP STEP AND EMIL DREW NEARER
THE TROUBLE IS YOU ALMOST HAVE TO MARRY A MAN BEFORE YOU CAN FIND OUT THE SORT OF WIFE HE NEEDS
THE OLD MAN IS GOING TO WORK IN THE CIGAR FACTORY AGAIN AT THIS LOU PLUNGED IN
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DID IT
WHY MARIE YOU ASKED ME TO COME YOURSELF YES YES I KNOW SHE SAID TEARFULLY BUT I DIDN'T THINK
BUT SHE HAD NOT SEEMED TO MISS JAN WHEN HE WAS GONE AND SHE HAD BEEN JUST AS KIND TO THE NEXT BOY
THE VEIL THAT HAD HUNG UNCERTAINLY BETWEEN THEM FOR SO LONG WAS DISSOLVED
ALWAYS PLANNED TO GET THROUGH TWO DAYS WORK IN ONE AND OFTEN GOT ONLY THE LEAST IMPORTANT THINGS DONE
AS SHE APPROACHED HIS DESK HE HANDED HER A TELEGRAM
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT ALFALFA HAS BEEN THE SALVATION OF THIS COUNTRY
HOW DID IT USE TO BE WHEN YOU AND FATHER FIRST CAME
WHEN THEY REACHED THE TERRACE AT THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH AMEDEE WHO WAS EXCITED BY HIS SUCCESS ON THE BALL-GROUNDS CHALLENGED EMIL TO A JUMPING-MATCH THOUGH HE KNEW HE WOULD BE BEATEN
HE TURNED PAINFULLY IN HIS BED AND LOOKED AT HIS WHITE HANDS WITH ALL THE WORK GONE OUT OF THEM
IN EACH EYE ONE OF THESE STREAKS MUST HAVE BEEN LARGER THAN THE OTHERS FOR THE EFFECT WAS THAT OF TWO DANCING POINTS OF LIGHT TWO LITTLE YELLOW BUBBLES SUCH AS RISE IN A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE
THEY HAVE BUILT THE ASYLUM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT AND THEY WILL NOT EVEN LET US LIVE IN THE HOLES WITH THE BADGERS
NEVER HAVE COLDS DO YOU
SOME OF THE BOYS WERE IN THEIR WHITE BASEBALL SUITS
OUR LIVES ARE LIKE THE YEARS ALL MADE UP OF WEATHER AND CROPS AND COWS
AS FOR ME YOU REMEMBER WHEN I BEGAN TO BUY LAND
AND THEN ALL AT ONCE MEN BEGAN TO COME TO ME OFFERING TO LEND ME MONEY--AND I DIDN'T NEED IT
LOU AND OSCAR HIRED TWO MEN AND PUT IN BIGGER CROPS THAN EVER BEFORE
BUT THE MOMENT HE BEGAN TO BULLY HER AND TO BE UNJUST SHE BEGAN TO DRAW AWAY
THEY ALL KNOW IT
ALEXANDRA WILL YOU GET THE CREAM JUG
SHE ALWAYS SAY I AIN'T NO MAN TO CARRY GUN
OH NONSENSE LOU
TELEPHONE WIRES HUM ALONG THE WHITE ROADS WHICH ALWAYS RUN AT RIGHT ANGLES
WE HAVE TO KEEP EM CLEAN YOU KNOW THE WARDEN PAUSED AT THE DOOR SPEAKING BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER TO A PALE YOUNG MAN IN CONVICTS CLOTHES WHO WAS SEATED AT A DESK IN THE CORNER WRITING IN A BIG LEDGER
EMIL WAS ALREADY AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL WALKING ABOUT WITH THE SHOULDER-MOTION HE HAD ACQUIRED AMONG THE MEXICANS STUDYING THE FLOOR WITH HIS INTENT DEEP-SET EYES
THAT WAS TOO MUCH FOR SIGNA LOU
MARIE STOLE SLOWLY FLUTTERINGLY ALONG THE PATH LIKE A WHITE NIGHT-MOTH OUT OF THE FIELDS
WHAT ABOUT HE ASKED ABSENTLY
PUT A FENCE AROUND IT AND TURN THE HOGS IN
NO NOBODY CAN SEE US
HE HAD AN AWFUL COLIC
I MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR MYSELF
I'M GOING TO TAKE BRIGHAM AND THE BUCKBOARD TO-MORROW AND DRIVE DOWN TO THE RIVER COUNTRY AND SPEND A FEW DAYS LOOKING OVER WHAT THEY'VE GOT DOWN THERE
AS HE WENT ABOUT GATHERING UP HIS BOOKS HE FELT AS IF HE WERE UPROOTING THINGS
BUT THE WAY TO MAKE FRANK WANT ANYTHING WAS TO TELL HIM HE COULDN'T HAVE IT
AMEDEE WILL BE A HANDSOME BRIDEGROOM
AND THAT SHE REFLECTED WAS WHAT SHE HAD WORKED FOR
HER EYES DRANK IN THE BREADTH OF IT UNTIL HER TEARS BLINDED HER
OR ABOUT HER LIFE ON A DAIRY FARM IN GOTTLAND WHEN SHE WAS A GIRL
MAYBE I COULD HIDE IN A BADGER-HOLE HE SUGGESTED DOUBTFULLY
WE ARE REALLY GOING AWAY SHE LOOKED AT HIM AS IF SHE WERE A LITTLE FRIGHTENED
HE WANTED TO PROVE TO HIMSELF THE WRONG HE FELT
BUT IT ISN'T AS IF WE COULD REALLY EVER BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU
ALEXANDRA TOOK HER THREE NIECES INTO THE FLOWER GARDEN
I'LL HAVE TO BRING ALEXANDRA UP TO SEE THIS THING WORK EMIL THOUGHT
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN OUT OF THE CORNFIELDS AND A FEW YEARS AGO SHE GOT DESPONDENT AND SAID LIFE WAS JUST THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND SHE DIDN'T SEE THE USE OF IT
HE STOOPED AND TOOK A SANDBURR FROM HIS TOE
DAYS WHEN SHE WAS CLOSE TO THE FLAT FALLOW WORLD ABOUT HER AND FELT AS IT WERE IN HER OWN BODY THE JOYOUS GERMINATION IN THE SOIL
WHEN THE ROAD BEGAN TO CLIMB THE FIRST LONG SWELLS OF THE DIVIDE ALEXANDRA HUMMED AN OLD SWEDISH HYMN AND EMIL WONDERED WHY HIS SISTER LOOKED SO HAPPY
I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU A LIFT IF YOU WERE DONE SHE GATHERED UP HER REINS
READ A FEW THINGS OVER A GREAT MANY TIMES
FRANK COULDN'T FIND ONE SO SURLY THAT HE WOULD NOT MAKE AN EFFORT TO PLEASE HER
BUT SIGNING PAPERS IS SIGNING PAPERS
THE STRAW-STACKS WERE THROWING LONG SHADOWS THE OWLS WERE FLYING HOME TO THE PRAIRIE-DOG TOWN
SHE HAD HELPED HIM PACK HIS TRUNK IN THE AFTERNOON
WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE BEAUTIFUL EARRINGS THEY BELONGED TO FATHER'S MOTHER
BUT THE FEET ARE FREE MEMBERS
PEOPLE KNOW US ON SIGHT CARL PAUSED
YOU KNOW THERE HAS BEEN TALK TALK ABOUT WHAT IVAR ABOUT SENDING ME AWAY
BUILT ON ISLANDS IT SEEMS TO BE WITH RIVERS AND GREEN FIELDS ALL ABOUT
LOOK AT HER
YOU WANNA BE A PRIEST MAYBE
ALEXANDRA HAD NEVER HEARD MARIE SPEAK SO FRANKLY ABOUT HER HUSBAND BEFORE AND SHE FELT THAT IT WAS WISER NOT TO ENCOURAGE HER
LIKE ONE MAN THE BOYS SWUNG OFF THEIR HATS IN A BROAD SALUTE AND BOWED THEIR HEADS AS THE HANDSOME OLD MAN LIFTED HIS TWO FINGERS IN THE EPISCOPAL BLESSING
I HAVE HEARD SO SHE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN MAKING THE OLD MAN UNDERSTAND
ALEXANDRA'S ALL RIGHT
IT WOULD BE EASIER TO TALK IF HE WERE NOT UNDER THE GAZE OF THOSE CLEAR DELIBERATE EYES THAT SAW SO FAR IN SOME DIRECTIONS AND WERE SO BLIND IN OTHERS
WHY DID SHE LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE AND WHY HAD SHE SEEMED PLEASED WHEN ALL THE FRENCH AND BOHEMIAN BOYS AND THE PRIEST HIMSELF CROWDED ROUND HER CANDY STAND
WE ARE NOT A TALENTED FAMILY THE SUPPER WAS TO BE AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE BASEMENT OF THE CHURCH AND AFTERWARD THERE WOULD BE A FAIR WITH CHARADES AND AN AUCTION
V WHEN FRANK SHABATA CAME IN FROM WORK AT FIVE O'CLOCK THAT EVENING OLD MOSES MARCEL RAOUL'S FATHER TELEPHONED HIM THAT AMEDEE HAD HAD A SEIZURE IN THE WHEATFIELD AND THAT DOCTOR PARADIS WAS GOING TO OPERATE ON HIM AS SOON AS THE HANOVER DOCTOR GOT THERE TO HELP
CERTAINLY YOU OUGHT NOT TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO WHAT THE BOYS SAY ALEXANDRA SIGHED
WHEN THE LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN EVERYBODY WAS LAUGHING AND SHOUTING AND ALL THE FRENCH GIRLS WERE ROSY AND SHINING WITH MIRTH
HE ALWAYS PUT ON A CLEAN SHIRT WHEN SUNDAY MORNING CAME ROUND THOUGH HE NEVER WENT TO CHURCH
IF THEY TALK TO HIM THE WAY THEY DID TO ME I THINK HE'LL GO AWAY EMIL GREW MORE AND MORE UNEASY
THEY SAID NOTHING MORE ABOUT ALEXANDRA'S PROJECT BUT SHE FELT SURE NOW THAT THEY WOULD CONSENT TO IT
IN THAT DREAM HE COULD LIE FOR HOURS AS IF IN A TRANCE
HE WENT FIRST TO SEE RAOUL MARCEL AND FOUND HIM INNOCENTLY PRACTISING THE GLORIA FOR THE BIG CONFIRMATION SERVICE ON SUNDAY WHILE HE POLISHED THE MIRRORS OF HIS FATHER'S SALOON
A SQUAD OF CADETS WERE GOING THROUGH THEIR DRILL BEHIND THE ARMORY AND THE COMMANDS OF THEIR YOUNG OFFICER RANG OUT AT REGULAR INTERVALS SO SHARP AND QUICK THAT ALEXANDRA COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
ALEXANDRA WANTS TO SEE YOUR HAMMOCKS IVAR LED ALEXANDRA AND EMIL TO HIS LITTLE CAVE HOUSE
SHE CAN MAKE MUCH MORE WITH HER EGGS AND BUTTER THAN THE WAGES OF A MAN
HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO PAY OFF YOUR MORTGAGES ALEXANDRA LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND BIT HER LIP
HE'LL FILL HER FULL OF NOTIONS
IT WAS A GREAT EXTRAVAGANCE IN THOSE DAYS
HE SMOKES TERRIBLE-SMELLING MEXICAN CIGARETTES AND TALKS SPANISH
WE'VE NEVER EITHER OF US HAD ANY OTHER CLOSE FRIEND
THAT IS A GOOD STORY
SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS WET LEGGINGS
MARIE TOOK WITH HER TO THE CONVENT UNDER THE CANVAS LINING OF HER TRUNK THE RESULTS OF A LABORIOUS AND SATISFYING MORNING ON FRANK'S PART
SHE'S THE MUSICIAN OF THE FAMILY
MARIE TOOK HIS LONG WHITE HAND LOOKED AT IT AND THEN BEGAN TO RUN OFF HER CARDS
TO-MORROW
YES HERE IT IS
AFTER DINNER LOU AND OSCAR WENT TO THE ORCHARD TO PICK CHERRIES--THEY HAD NEITHER OF THEM HAD THE PATIENCE TO GROW AN ORCHARD OF THEIR OWN--AND ANNIE WENT DOWN TO GOSSIP WITH ALEXANDRA'S KITCHEN GIRLS WHILE THEY WASHED THE DISHES
CAN IT BE THAT IT IS CARL LINSTRUM
TWO STALWART GIRLS CAME DOWN THE LIBRARY STEPS AND OUT THROUGH ONE OF THE IRON GATES
YES WE'VE GOT A BOY TOO
ONCE A YEAR HE WENT TO HASTINGS OR TO OMAHA ON A SPREE
YES IN SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED EMIL WAS ALREADY GONE
DOES SHE ALWAYS RUN ALEXANDRA NODDED
IT'S THE GREATEST THING EVER EMIL LAUGHED
ISN'T IT FOOLISH
AT HOME IN THE OLD COUNTRY THERE WERE MANY LIKE ME WHO HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY GOD OR WHO HAD SEEN THINGS IN THE GRAVEYARD AT NIGHT AND WERE DIFFERENT AFTERWARD
SYMPATHY ALWAYS CLEARED HIS MIND AND RIDICULE WAS POISON TO HIM
I'M NOT GOING HUNTING WITH YOU ANY MORE
YOU DID NOT SEE THEM UNTIL YOU CAME DIRECTLY UPON THEM
STEPPING OFF THE HEADER WITHOUT STOPPING IT HE RAN UP TO EMIL WHO HAD DISMOUNTED
HE SAID HE FELT BETTER THIS MORNING BUT I DON'T THINK HE OUGHT TO BE OUT IN THE FIELD OVERHEATING HIMSELF ANGELIQUE DID NOT SPEAK WITH MUCH ANXIETY NOT BECAUSE SHE WAS INDIFFERENT BUT BECAUSE SHE FELT SO SECURE IN THEIR GOOD FORTUNE
NO HE DIDN'T REALLY
THE PASTURES THE STUBBLE THE ROADS THE SKY ARE THE SAME LEADEN GRAY
IF YOU HAD HAD ILL-FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME TO HASTINGS LONG AGO AS IVAR TALKED HIS GLOOM LIFTED
THAT WAS WHY EMIL WENT TO MEXICO OF COURSE
HE IS GOING TO ALASKA OSCAR STUDIED THE VISITOR'S YELLOW SHOES
HE WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIS FRIEND'S GOOD FORTUNE
IT SEEMS TO BRING BACK FEELINGS YOU HAD WHEN YOU WERE A BABY
DIDN'T YOU NOTICE THE BOX I WAS CARRYING
A FEW DUCKS THIS MORNING
ALEXANDRA WENT TO THE DOOR AND BECKONED TO HER BROTHERS TWO STRAPPING BOYS OF SEVENTEEN AND NINETEEN
LOU CAME DOWN THE PATH AND CLIMBED INTO THE FRONT SEAT TOOK UP THE REINS AND DROVE OFF WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING FURTHER TO ANY ONE
THE DWELLING-HOUSES WERE SET ABOUT HAPHAZARD ON THE TOUGH PRAIRIE SOD
DON'T YOU KNOW ME ALEXANDRA
I LIKE MY OWN WAY AND I HAVE A QUICK TONGUE
HIS CAP WAS PULLED DOWN OVER HIS EARS
SEE THIS YOU HAVE WALKED INTO A TRAP
WHEN SHE LOOKED FOR EMIL SHE FOUND HIM SITTING ON A STEP OF THE STAIRCASE THAT LED UP TO THE CLOTHING AND CARPET DEPARTMENT
WHAT CAN BE DONE IVAR'S LITTLE EYES BEGAN TO SHINE
ON HER FACE THERE WAS A LOOK OF INEFFABLE CONTENT
THE IDLENESS OF THOSE DAYS IN BED THE RELAXATION OF BODY WHICH ATTENDED THEM ENABLED ALEXANDRA TO THINK MORE CALMLY THAN SHE HAD DONE SINCE EMIL'S DEATH
IT'S QUEER WHAT THINGS ONE REMEMBERS AND WHAT THINGS ONE FORGETS EMIL YAWNED AND SAT UP
THEY HAD JUST COME UP FROM A SUNDAY PRACTICE GAME DOWN IN THE BALLGROUNDS
MAYBE
I NO CARE FOR NOT'ING BUT DAT FINE BOY I KILL ALEXANDRA BERGSON
WE'RE ALL EVER SO MUCH OLDER AND SLOWER
I THOUGHT PERHAPS I COULD DO THAT
ALEXANDRA HAD NOT THE HEART TO TAKE HIM AWAY FROM SO PRETTY A PLAYFELLOW AND SHE LET THEM TEASE THE KITTEN TOGETHER UNTIL JOE TOVESKY CAME IN NOISILY AND PICKED UP HIS LITTLE NIECE SETTING HER ON HIS SHOULDER FOR EVERY ONE TO SEE
HE WAS CONTENT TO LEAVE THE TANGLE TO OTHER HANDS
WHAT NONSENSE HE MURMURED
WHAT A CHARMING CREATURE CARL MURMURED
HE AND HIS COUSINS BOUGHT A STEAM THRESHER ON SHARES
THE RATTLE OF HER WAGON WAS LOST IN THE HOWLING OF THE WIND BUT HER LANTERN HELD FIRMLY BETWEEN HER FEET MADE A MOVING POINT OF LIGHT ALONG THE HIGHWAY GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE DARK COUNTRY
IT HAPPENS LIKE THAT IN THE WORLD SOMETIMES ALEXANDRA HE ADDED EARNESTLY
YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME TO BE MORE LONELY THAN I HAVE BEEN WOULD YOU CARL LAUGHED AND PUSHED BACK THE TRIANGULAR LOCK OF HAIR WITH THE EDGE OF HIS HAT
BEING WHAT HE WAS SHE FELT FRANK COULD NOT HAVE ACTED OTHERWISE
FRANK SAT UP UNTIL A LATE HOUR READING THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPERS
IN A FEW YEARS HIS UNPRINCIPLED WIFE WARPED THE PROBITY OF A LIFETIME
I'LL KEEP HIM AT HOME SO DON'T TROUBLE ANY MORE ABOUT HIM LOU
MILLY CAN PLAY IN CHURCH JUST THE SAME AND SHE'LL STILL PLAY ON THE ORGAN
IVAR I THINK IT HAS DONE ME GOOD TO GET COLD CLEAR THROUGH LIKE THIS ONCE
ONLY GOOD THINGS COULD HAPPEN TO A RICH ENERGETIC HANDSOME YOUNG MAN LIKE AMEDEE WITH A NEW BABY IN THE CRADLE AND A NEW HEADER IN THE FIELD
SHE LONGED TO BE FREE FROM HER OWN BODY WHICH ACHED AND WAS SO HEAVY
WHEN THE WORD WAS GIVEN TO MOUNT THE YOUNG MEN RODE AT A WALK OUT OF THE VILLAGE
WHY DON'T YOU GET AFTER THEM
BUT SHE DID NOT WANT TO DIE
THEN WHATEVER WAS LEFT BETWEEN THEM WOULD BE HONEST
I WANT YOU TO BE INDEPENDENT AND EMIL TO GO TO SCHOOL LOU HELD HIS HEAD AS IF IT WERE SPLITTING
THE WORST OF THE SWEDES IS THAT THEY'RE NEVER WILLING TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH THEY DON'T KNOW
BEEN MAKING HIM WALK THE FLOOR WITH YOU ANGELIQUE SNIFFED
HER BODY WAS IN AN ATTITUDE OF PERFECT REPOSE SUCH AS IT WAS APT TO TAKE WHEN SHE WAS THINKING EARNESTLY
AT LAST HE THREW DOWN THE PAGE WITH A SNORT
WHEN ALEXANDRA ASKED SIGNA WHETHER SHE THOUGHT NELSE WAS IN EARNEST THE POOR CHILD HID HER HANDS UNDER HER APRON AND MURMURED I DON'T KNOW MA'M
I WANT TO TAKE A YEAR OFF AND LOOK AROUND
I'VE ENJOYED A GREAT MANY THINGS BUT I'VE GOT NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT ALL BUT YOU SHOW FOR IT YOURSELF CARL
YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU ONCE SAID ABOUT THE GRAVEYARD AND THE OLD STORY WRITING ITSELF OVER
THEY COME FROM VERY FAR AWAY AND ARE GREAT COMPANY
OF COURSE
HE KNELT AND UNCOVERED AS THE BISHOP PASSED
HAD SHE PERHAPS THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD COME TO HER
SINCE NOON HE HAD BEEN DRINKING TOO MUCH AND HE WAS IN A BAD TEMPER
IT WAS A COMFORT TO HEAR HER FRIEND'S VOICE
I'VE ALWAYS HOPED YOU WOULD GET AWAY
HAD SHE QUARRELED WITH HER HUSBAND
BUT I'LL DO EXACTLY AS I PLEASE WITH THE REST OF MY LAND BOYS THE REST OF YOUR LAND CRIED LOU GROWING MORE EXCITED EVERY MINUTE
THE CHURCH HELPS PEOPLE INDEED IT DOES
OH EMIL HE CRIED HUGGING HIS OLD FRIEND RAPTUROUSLY WHY AIN'T YOU BEEN UP TO SEE MY BOY
OH IT WOULD COME AGAIN
I CAN REMEMBER HEARING HIM SINGING WITH THE SAILORS DOWN IN THE SHIPYARD WHEN I WAS NO BIGGER THAN STELLA HERE POINTING TO ANNIE'S YOUNGER DAUGHTER
IF SHE MAKES MISTAKES SHE WILL NOT MAKE SO MANY AS I HAVE MADE
AFTER A DOZEN TRIALS HE SUCCEEDED IN LIGHTING THE LANTERN WHICH HE PLACED IN FRONT OF ALEXANDRA HALF COVERING IT WITH A BLANKET SO THAT THE LIGHT WOULD NOT SHINE IN HER EYES
FROM HABIT HE WENT TOWARD THE HOUSE WHERE HE WAS USED TO BEING SOOTHED WHEN HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF INTO A FRENZY BUT AT THE SIGHT OF THE BLACK OPEN DOOR HE STARTED BACK
AND YOU GOD BE WITH YOU REPLIED IVAR AS HE CLAMBERED INTO THE CART AND PUT THE LANTERN UNDER THE OILCLOTH LAP-COVER
WE MUST HAVE FAITH IN THE HIGH LAND EMIL
WHY NO OF COURSE NOT
THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING HOMELY AND WAYWARD AND DEFINITELY PERSONAL ABOUT HIM
ANYBODY HERE FEELS FREE TO BORROW THE MOWER AND BREAK IT OR TURN THEIR HOGS IN ON ME
BUT THERE WAS EMIL IN THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD AT HOME AND HERE WAS FRANK SHABATA
IS THAT IT MAYBE SAID EMIL
HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH A THING GROANING AND MUMBLING HE LED HER OUT OF THE GATE AND HELPED HER INTO THE CART WRAPPING HER IN THE DRY BLANKETS ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SITTING
IT'S NOT OFTEN I LET THREE DAYS GO BY WITHOUT SEEING MARIE
ANY ONE COULD SEE WITH HALF AN EYE THAT HIS PROUD HEART WAS BLEEDING FOR SOMEBODY
THE WEST IS GOING TO MAKE ITSELF HEARD CARL LAUGHED
HE WAS THINKING ABOUT THE RECKLESS LIFE HE MEANT TO LIVE IN MEXICO
SHE DROPPED DOWN ON THE GROUND AT ALEXANDRA'S SIDE AND TUCKED HER FEET UNDER HER
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE USED HER SO IN HIS RIGHT SENSES
ALEXANDRA TOOK OFF HER SHADE-HAT AND THREW IT ON THE GROUND
YES AND HE DIED IN A DARK TIME
SHE DIDN'T MIND SHOWING HER EMBARRASSMENT AT ALL
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE ABOUT THE SHABATAS HOUSE EXCEPT A BIG YELLOW CAT SUNNING ITSELF ON THE KITCHEN DOORSTEP
HIS MIND TRAVELED AHEAD TO THE STILE WHICH HE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS HAUNTED BY EMIL BERGSON
ONLY THREE WEEKS AGO HE HAD PROUDLY CARRIED HIS BABY THERE TO BE CHRISTENED
THAT I RUINED HIM BY SENDING HIM TO COLLEGE NO I DON'T CARE A BUTTON FOR LOU OR OSCAR
WITH THE MEMORY HE LEFT HER SHE COULD BE AS RASH AS SHE CHOSE
AREN'T YOU AFRAID TO GO TO IVAR'S IN THAT NEW SHIRT EMIL
MARIE LISTENED TO EVERY WORD ONLY TAKING HER EYES FROM EMIL TO WATCH FRANK'S PLATE AND KEEP IT FILLED
SHE'LL WORK ALL DAY AND GO TO A BOHEMIAN WEDDING AND DANCE ALL NIGHT AND DRIVE THE HAY WAGON FOR A CROSS MAN NEXT MORNING
THEY LOOK THIS WAY AND THAT AND FAR BELOW THEM THEY SEE SOMETHING SHINING LIKE A PIECE OF GLASS SET IN THE DARK EARTH
HE WAS READY TO GIVE UP HE FELT
THREE YEARS OF DROUTH AND FAILURE THE LAST STRUGGLE OF A WILD SOIL AGAINST THE ENCROACHING PLOWSHARE
I DON'T WANT YOU TO IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY OSCAR SHOOK HIS HEAD
NO LOU I WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT WITH THE SMART YOUNG MAN WHO IS RAISING THE NEW KIND OF CLOVER
IF YOU KEPT YOUR CHICKENS LIKE THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE TWO LYING IN THE GRASS SOMETHING IN THE WAY MARIE HAD SETTLED HER CHEEK ON EMIL'S SHOULDER THAT TOLD HER EVERYTHING
HOW PRETTY YOU LOOK CHILD
I AM TIRED SHE MURMURED
THE SORT OF MAN YOU COULD ATTACH TO A CORN-SHELLER AS YOU WOULD AN ENGINE
TO BE SURE THEY ALWAYS WASTED A GOOD DEAL OF TIME GETTING IN EACH OTHER'S WAY AND GIGGLING AT EACH OTHER'S MISTAKES
I GUESS LOU AND OSCAR WILL BE SORE ABOUT IT I SUPPOSE THEY WILL ALEXANDRA SAT DOWN ON THE LOUNGE BESIDE HIM
EMIL RAN FROM THE WINDMILL TO OPEN THE CORRAL GATE
ARE YOU GOING TO PAINT THE INDIANS PAINT THE YOUNG MAN FROWNED
SHE WAS SHIVERING WITH COLD AND EXCITEMENT
HE WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED WHEN I TOLD HIM HOW YOU'D PUT UP WITH IVAR
MAYBE I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN VERY SOFT ANYHOW
HOW DOES IT WORK ANNIE CAME TO THE FORE TO GIVE LOU TIME TO RECOVER HIMSELF
SUDDENLY THE WOMAN STIRRED AND UTTERED A CRY THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER
CARL WENT ABOUT OVER THE FARMS WITH ALEXANDRA IN THE MORNING AND IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING THEY FOUND A GREAT DEAL TO TALK ABOUT
CAN IT BE SHE EXCLAIMED WITH FEELING
ALEXANDRA YOU WILL HAVE TO DO THE BEST YOU CAN FOR YOUR BROTHERS
WHEN I RENTED THIS PLACE THE TENANTS NEVER KEPT THE ORCHARD UP AND EMIL AND I USED TO COME OVER AND TAKE CARE OF IT OURSELVES
I'M RESTLESS
IT'S BY UNDERSTANDING ME AND THE BOYS AND MOTHER THAT YOU'VE HELPED ME
VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM
IT TOOK COURAGE TO COME AT ALL ALEXANDRA
THROUGH THE DOOR HE OPENED A GUARD CAME IN BRINGING FRANK SHABATA
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM ALL RIGHT HE SAID RISING
ANGELIQUE AMEDEE'S PRETTY BRIDE AS BLONDE AND FAIR AS HER NAME WHO HAD COME OUT TO WATCH THE MATCH TOSSED HER HEAD AT EMIL AND SAID MEDEE COULD JUMP MUCH HIGHER THAN YOU IF HE WERE AS TALL
THE FAMILY PARTY WAS COMPLETE EXCEPT FOR EMIL AND OSCAR'S WIFE WHO IN THE COUNTRY PHRASE WAS NOT GOING ANYWHERE JUST NOW OSCAR SAT AT THE FOOT OF THE TABLE AND HIS FOUR TOW-HEADED LITTLE BOYS AGED FROM TWELVE TO FIVE WERE RANGED AT ONE SIDE
THE MEN WERE BUYING TOBACCO AND CANDY WITH WHAT MONEY THEY HAD LEFT WERE SHOWING EACH OTHER NEW BOOTS AND GLOVES AND BLUE FLANNEL SHIRTS
ALEXANDRA'S EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
THINGS AWAY FROM HOME OFTEN LOOK BETTER THAN THEY ARE
ALEXANDRA DID NOT PROPOSE ANY REFORMS IN THE CARE OF THE PIGS AND THEY HOPED SHE HAD FORGOTTEN IVAR'S TALK
OLD TOVESKY WAS HAVING A COMFORTABLE PIPE BEFORE HE WENT TO BED
I WANT TO GO TO A NEW PLACE
HE HAD GOT INTO THE HABIT OF SEEING HIMSELF ALWAYS IN DESPERATE STRAITS
BY WILLA CATHER PART I
HOW DO YOU EVER WEAR IT
OH WATER-COLOR SKETCHES--DONE FOR AMUSEMENT
WHY SIGNA YOU AND NELSE ARE TO RIDE HOME
HE WENT INTO HIS BEDROOM AND TOOK HIS MURDEROUS 405 WINCHESTER FROM THE CLOSET
WHY NEED YOU LISTEN
IT'S GETTING COLDER EVERY MINUTE
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO
THERE WAS A KITCHEN STOVE A TABLE COVERED WITH OILCLOTH TWO CHAIRS A CLOCK A CALENDAR A FEW BOOKS ON THE WINDOW-SHELF
WASHING THEM EVERY NIGHT EVEN IN WINTER ALEXANDRA LAUGHED
FATHER WASN'T CONCEITED UNCLE OTTO WASN'T
MY LUCK HASN'T CHANGED ANY
OH EMIL SHE CLUTCHED HIS SLEEVE AND BEGAN TO CRY WHAT AM I TO DO IF YOU DON'T GO AWAY
YOU CAN'T SEE THINGS BUT THEY COME TO YOU SOMEHOW AND YOU KNOW THEM AND AREN'T AFRAID OF THEM
THE HOUSEWIVES HAD MUCH ADO TO TEAR THEMSELVES AWAY FROM THE GENERAL REJOICING AND HURRY BACK TO THEIR KITCHENS
OF THE YOUNGEST GIRL SIGNA WHO HAS A PRETTY FIGURE MOTTLED PINK CHEEKS AND YELLOW HAIR ALEXANDRA IS VERY FOND THOUGH SHE KEEPS A SHARP EYE UPON HER
LET ME MAKE YOU SOME COFFEE WHAT ELSE AM I TO DO HE CRIED HOTLY IN BOHEMIAN
OH MY NO
FROM THAT SPOT THERE WAS ANOTHER TRAIL HEAVIER THAN THE FIRST WHERE SHE MUST HAVE DRAGGED HERSELF BACK TO EMIL'S BODY
BECAUSE SHE KNEW FRANK WAS SURLY ABOUT DOING LITTLE THINGS TO HELP HIS WIFE SHE WAS ALWAYS SENDING EMIL OVER TO SPADE OR PLANT OR CARPENTER FOR MARIE
THE GUN SPRANG TO HIS SHOULDER HE SIGHTED MECHANICALLY AND FIRED THREE TIMES WITHOUT STOPPING STOPPED WITHOUT KNOWING WHY
THE PROPERTY OF A FAMILY REALLY BELONGS TO THE MEN OF THE FAMILY NO MATTER ABOUT THE TITLE
SOMETIMES HE TALKS ABOUT STUDYING LAW AND SOMETIMES JUST LATELY HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT GOING OUT INTO THE SAND HILLS AND TAKING UP MORE LAND
TO HOLD HIMSELF AWAY FROM THINGS AS IF HE WERE AFRAID OF BEING HURT
HE HAD DRIVEN DOWN FROM SOMEWHERE UP IN THE FRENCH COUNTRY AND HE WAS SELLING THEM TWENTY-FIVE CENTS A PECK
THE RIVER WAS CLEAR THERE AND SHALLOW SINCE THERE HAD BEEN NO RAIN AND IT RAN IN RIPPLES OVER THE SPARKLING SAND
THE CHURCH STILL HAS HER CAVALRY AS THE TROOP SWEPT PAST THE GRAVEYARD HALF A MILE EAST OF THE TOWN,--THE FIRST FRAME CHURCH OF THE PARISH HAD STOOD THERE,--OLD PIERRE SEGUIN WAS ALREADY OUT WITH HIS PICK AND SPADE DIGGING AMEDEE'S GRAVE
THE HIGH HILLS ARE A REFUGE FOR THE WILD GOATS
IMMEDIATELY THAT TOO WAS GONE
OSCAR STILL HAS A THICK ACCENT BUT LOU SPEAKS LIKE ANYBODY FROM IOWA
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD OF HIM EMIL ALEXANDRA FELT THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THERE HAD BEEN A MAN OF HIS KIN WHOM HE COULD ADMIRE
I COULD HAVE HIDDEN IT UNDER THE STRAW IN THE BOTTOM OF THE WAGON THEN WE'D HAVE HAD TO LIE TO IVAR
DAY AND NIGHT BY THE FASTEST BOATS AND TRAINS HE COULD CATCH
I SEE A LONG JOURNEY ACROSS WATER FOR YOU FATHER
A SINGLE PAGE OF NOTEPAPER A BARE STATEMENT OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
BUT ONE THING WAS CLEAR HE TOLD HIMSELF
MOST OF ALEXANDRA'S HAPPY MEMORIES WERE AS IMPERSONAL AS THIS ONE
YOU THE LADY THAT WANTED TO TALK TO 1037
MANY OF THEM GO OVER IN THE FALL
HOW WICKEDLY YOU TALK
HE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT HAD COME ABOUT BUT HE WAS QUITE WILLING TO GO DEEP UNDER HIS FIELDS AND REST WHERE THE PLOW COULD NOT FIND HIM
I OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL THAT THIS PATH HASN'T BEEN WORN BY--WELL BY FRIENDS WITH MORE PRESSING ERRANDS THAN YOUR LITTLE BOHEMIAN IS LIKELY TO HAVE HE PAUSED TO GIVE ALEXANDRA HIS HAND AS SHE STEPPED OVER THE STILE
I CAN'T KEEP HIM OUT OF IT
WELL IT'S TIME TO TURN IN HE ROSE AND GOING OVER TO ALEXANDRA STOOPED DOWN AND KISSED HER LIGHTLY ON THE CHEEK
EMIL MUST HAVE FELT ABOUT IT AS SHE DID FOR AFTERWARD WHEN THEY WERE AT HOME HE USED SOMETIMES TO SAY SISTER YOU KNOW OUR DUCK DOWN THERE ALEXANDRA REMEMBERED THAT DAY AS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST IN HER LIFE
HE KNEW WHERE IT ALL WENT TO WHAT IT ALL BECAME
THAT IS I WOULD LIKE TO FIND SOME OF MY BROTHER'S FRIENDS
ON THE OUTSIDE EMIL IS JUST LIKE AN AMERICAN BOY,--HE GRADUATED FROM THE STATE UNIVERSITY IN JUNE YOU KNOW,--BUT UNDERNEATH HE IS MORE SWEDISH THAN ANY OF US
MARIA HE SOBBED ALOUD MARIA WHEN FRANK WAS HALFWAY TO HANOVER THE MOTION OF HIS HORSE BROUGHT ON A VIOLENT ATTACK OF NAUSEA
STOUT AS SHE WAS SHE ROAMED THE SCRUBBY BANKS OF NORWAY CREEK LOOKING FOR FOX GRAPES AND GOOSE PLUMS LIKE A WILD CREATURE IN SEARCH OF PREY
WE CAN REMEMBER THE GRAVEYARD WHEN IT WAS WILD PRAIRIE CARL AND NOW AND NOW THE OLD STORY HAS BEGUN TO WRITE ITSELF OVER THERE SAID CARL SOFTLY
AND THAT WAS ALL YOU SAW
WE WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT ALEXANDRA SAID PRESSING HIS HAND
I WAS AFRAID YOU HAD A COLD WHEN I TALKED TO YOU OVER THE TELEPHONE THE OTHER NIGHT MARIE
A SLENDER MAN OF THIRTY-FIVE WITH SOFT HAIR CURLING ABOUT HIS HIGH FOREHEAD A DROOPING MUSTACHE AND WONDERING SAD EYES THAT LOOKED FORWARD INTO THE DISTANCE AS IF THEY ALREADY BEHELD THE NEW WORLD
LOU NOW LOOKS THE OLDER OF THE TWO
SHE WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT
JOHN BERGSON HAD THE OLD-WORLD BELIEF THAT LAND IN ITSELF IS DESIRABLE
HE LOOKED LESS LIKE A TIRED SCHOLAR THAN WHEN HE WENT AWAY A YEAR AGO BUT NO ONE EVEN NOW WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM FOR A MAN OF BUSINESS
WELL WITH THE MONEY WE BUY A HALF-SECTION FROM LINSTRUM AND A HALF FROM CROW AND A QUARTER FROM STRUBLE MAYBE
DOES MILLY RUN ABOUT OVER THE COUNTRY AS YOU AND ALEXANDRA USED TO ANNIE MILLY'S MOTHER PROTESTED
IF YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW I COULD MAKE YOU MARIE CLASPED HER HANDS AND STARTED UP FROM HER SEAT
THE FRENCH BOYS LIKED A BIT OF SWAGGER AND THEY WERE ALWAYS DELIGHTED TO HEAR ABOUT ANYTHING NEW
YES I KNOW BOYS ARE THOUGHTLESS
VERY LITHE AND ACTIVE AND NEATLY MADE WITH A CLEAR BROWN AND WHITE SKIN AND FLASHING WHITE TEETH
THE SAME BUSINESS WOULD GO ON IN ANOTHER STREET
HIS SHRUNKEN BROWN FLANNEL DRESS HAD BEEN WASHED MANY TIMES AND LEFT A LONG STRETCH OF STOCKING BETWEEN THE HEM OF HIS SKIRT AND THE TOPS OF HIS CLUMSY COPPER-TOED SHOES
HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAD ANY REAL GRIEVANCE
HIS BLACK HAIR WHICH STILL HUNG IN A TRIANGLE OVER HIS PALE FOREHEAD WAS THIN AT THE CROWN AND THERE WERE FINE RELENTLESS LINES ABOUT HIS EYES
AND WE'VE HAD GOOD TIMES HUNTING FOR CHRISTMAS TREES AND GOING FOR DUCKS AND MAKING OUR PLUM WINE TOGETHER EVERY YEAR
IT'S NOT THE PRINCIPAL I'M WORRIED ABOUT IT'S THE INTEREST AND TAXES
WHEN HE CAME BACK WITH THE SPIKES ALEXANDRA ASKED HIM WHAT HE HAD DONE WITH HIS OVERCOAT
FATHER HAD A HARD FIGHT HERE DIDN'T HE HE ADDED THOUGHTFULLY
YES SIT DOWN
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR DADDY KID
THEY SEEMED A LITTLE LIKE THE PRISON WHERE SHE HAD WORN THEM YESTERDAY AND TO BE OUT OF PLACE IN THE OPEN FIELDS
BUT THE STAINED SLIPPERY GRASS THE DARKENED MULBERRIES TOLD ONLY HALF THE STORY
I HOPE HE DOES NOT SEE ME NOW
WHEN IVAR LOST HIS LAND THROUGH MISMANAGEMENT A DOZEN YEARS AGO ALEXANDRA TOOK HIM IN AND HE HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF HER HOUSEHOLD EVER SINCE
ALEXANDRA BEGAN TO LAUGH
HE ALWAYS PROMISED THEM TO ME
THE GENERAL MERCHANDISE STORES THE TWO BANKS THE DRUG STORE THE FEED STORE THE SALOON THE POST-OFFICE
ALWAYS BE JOLLY
BUT SHE'S APT TO BE SENSIBLE
HOW YOU KEEP FROM FREEZE SHE POINTED TO THE WINDOW-SHELVES FULL OF BLOOMING FUCHSIAS AND GERANIUMS
WE HAVEN'T GOT HEADER BOXES ENOUGH TO FEED THE THRESHER I GUESS AMEDEE STARTED HOT-FOOT ACROSS THE STUBBLE LEANING A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT AS HE RAN AND WAVED TO THE ENGINEER NOT TO STOP THE ENGINE
BUT THEIR CHILDREN WOULDN'T
BUT ON MY WAY BACK I MET LOU AND OSCAR AND GOT SO ANGRY THAT I FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE
IT'S A COMFORT TO HIM THAT MY CHICKENS ARE LAYING RIGHT ON THROUGH THE COLD WEATHER AND BRINGING IN A LITTLE MONEY
IF MARIE HAD BEEN UNMARRIED,--OH YES
WE DON'T SUFFER LIKE--THOSE YOUNG ONES ALEXANDRA ENDED WITH A SIGH
HE WAS A LITTLE COUNTRY BOY AND THIS VILLAGE WAS TO HIM A VERY STRANGE AND PERPLEXING PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WORE FINE CLOTHES AND HAD HARD HEARTS
THEN SHE WOULD HAVE KEPT HER EYES OPEN
EMIL AND HIS COMPANION LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY AND EMIL RAN TO PICK THEM UP
THAT RAPTURE WAS FOR THOSE WHO COULD FEEL IT
THEY LOST THEIR VAGUENESS
WON'T YOU COME UP TO THE HOUSE WHY NOT SIT DOWN THERE IN YOUR CORNER
THAT EVENING AFTER SUPPER CARL AND ALEXANDRA WERE SITTING BY THE CLUMP OF CASTOR BEANS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOWER GARDEN
NEVERTHELESS WHEN ONE CONSIDERED THAT HIS CHIEF BUSINESS WAS HORSE-DOCTORING IT SEEMED RATHER SHORT-SIGHTED OF HIM TO LIVE IN THE MOST INACCESSIBLE PLACE HE COULD FIND
DO YOU FEEL AT PEACE WITH THE WORLD HERE
TWO THICK BRAIDS PINNED ABOUT HER HEAD IN THE GERMAN WAY WITH A FRINGE OF REDDISH-YELLOW CURLS BLOWING OUT FROM UNDER HER CAP
SHE WOULD ALEXANDRA'S VOICE BROKE
YOU HAVE A LITTLE SORGHUM PATCH MAYBE
IF THE WORLD WERE NO WIDER THAN MY CORNFIELDS IF THERE WERE NOT SOMETHING BESIDE THIS I WOULDN'T FEEL THAT IT WAS MUCH WORTH WHILE TO WORK
HE PEERED AGAIN THROUGH THE HEDGE AT THE TWO DARK FIGURES UNDER THE TREE
BETWEEN THE MIXING-BOARD AND THE STOVE STOOD THE OLD CRADLE THAT HAD BEEN AMEDEE'S AND IN IT WAS HIS BLACK-EYED SON
I NEVER DID KNOW A BOY TWENTY-TWO YEARS OLD BEFORE THAT DIDN'T HAVE NO GIRL
IF HE EVER GOT RICH HE MEANT TO BUY HER PRETTY CLOTHES AND TAKE HER TO CALIFORNIA IN A PULLMAN CAR AND TREAT HER LIKE A LADY
EMIL CAUGHT HIS ARMS
TO-NIGHT AFTER THEY SAT DOWN TO SUPPER OSCAR KEPT LOOKING AT LOU AS IF HE EXPECTED HIM TO SAY SOMETHING AND LOU BLINKED HIS EYES AND FROWNED AT HIS PLATE
THEN HE WENT ON IN A LOW TONE SO INTENSE THAT IT WAS ALMOST THREATENING
IN THOSE GERMLESS DAYS SHE HAD WORN BITS OF BROOM-STRAW PLUCKED FROM THE COMMON SWEEPING-BROOM IN THE LOBES UNTIL THE HOLES WERE HEALED AND READY FOR LITTLE GOLD RINGS
I GOT AN AWFUL PAIN IN ME EMIL
DO YOU THINK ALEXANDRA LIKES HIM VERY MUCH I SUPPOSE SO
THERE MY SON
HIS HAND WAS STILL UNSTEADY WHEN HE TOOK HIS GLASS FROM THE BARTENDER
OSCAR'S WIFE FROM THE MALARIA DISTRICT OF MISSOURI WAS ASHAMED OF MARRYING A FOREIGNER AND HIS BOYS DO NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD OF SWEDISH
THE PROPERTY OF A FAMILY BELONGS TO THE MEN OF THE FAMILY BECAUSE THEY ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE AND BECAUSE THEY DO THE WORK ALEXANDRA LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER HER EYES FULL OF INDIGNATION
HE WAS IN A STRANGE COUNTRY HE HAD NO KINSMEN OR FRIENDS AND IN A MOMENT HE HAD RUINED HIS LIFE
ALL AFTERNOON THE SITTING-ROOM WAS FULL OF QUIET AND SUNLIGHT
ALL THE PHYSICAL OPERATIONS OF LIFE SEEMED DIFFICULT AND PAINFUL
IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HIS SISTER WAS A HANDSOME WOMAN UNTIL MARIE SHABATA HAD TOLD HIM SO
IT SENDS GOOD DREAMS SHE WOULD SAY WITH A TWINKLE IN HER EYE
THEY HAD SEEMED TO AVOID HER EVER SINCE CARL LINSTRUM'S ARRIVAL FOUR WEEKS AGO THAT DAY AND SHE HURRIED TO THE DOOR TO WELCOME THEM
THE THING TO DO WAS TO GET BACK TO IOWA TO ILLINOIS TO ANY PLACE THAT HAD BEEN PROVED HABITABLE
HIS ANGER HAD BURNED ITSELF OUT AND LEFT HIM SICK AND DISGUSTED
I'D RATHER HAVE DUCKS FOR SUPPER THAN CRAZY IVAR'S TONGUE EMIL WAS ALARMED
IVAR SIGNA ASKED SUDDENLY WILL YOU TELL ME WHY YOU GO BAREFOOT
HOW AM I GOING TO GET MARRIED WITHOUT ANY GIRL AMEDEE TOOK HIS ARM
HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE WALKED THIS PATH TOGETHER CARL
IN THIS CORNER THE GROUND DIPPED A LITTLE AND THE BLUE-GRASS WHICH THE WEEDS HAD DRIVEN OUT IN THE UPPER PART OF THE ORCHARD GREW THICK AND LUXURIANT
WHEN ALEXANDRA WAS IN BED WRAPPED IN HOT BLANKETS IVAR CAME IN WITH HIS TEA AND SAW THAT SHE DRANK IT
A PALE PINK CREPT OVER HIS NECK AND FACE
I THINK I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE LIVED TO FIND OUT WHAT I HAVE TO-DAY SHE SAID QUIETLY CLOSING HER DESK
IT'S BACK THERE IN THE STRAW
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE TWO BOYS AT THE TABLE NEGLECTED THEIR GAME TO LISTEN
I KNOW EMIL WAS ALWAYS LIKE THAT TO WOMEN AND AGAIN AFTER SHE HAD UNDRESSED AND WAS STANDING IN HER NIGHTGOWN BRUSHING HER LONG HEAVY HAIR BY THE ELECTRIC LIGHT SHE REMEMBERED HIM AND SAID TO HERSELF I DON'T THINK I EVER HEARD A NICER VOICE THAN THAT BOY HAD
SHE SPENT A WHOLE DAY WITH ONE YOUNG FARMER WHO HAD BEEN AWAY AT SCHOOL AND WHO WAS EXPERIMENTING WITH A NEW KIND OF CLOVER HAY
WHERE I GO TO WORK THE BEDS ARE NOT HALF SO EASY AS THIS BY THIS TIME EMIL HAD LOST ALL HIS TIMIDITY
YES VERY PRESSING BUSINESS
HE COULD NOT HAVE BUCKLED A BRIDLE ON HIS OWN
THESE GIRLS WITH THEIR LONG LETTERS FROM HOME THEIR FINERY AND THEIR LOVE-AFFAIRS AFFORDED HER A GREAT DEAL OF ENTERTAINMENT AND THEY WERE COMPANY FOR HER WHEN EMIL WAS AWAY AT SCHOOL
DIDN'T I SEE HIM TAKE THE HORN OFF THE BERQUIST'S COW WHEN SHE HAD TORN IT LOOSE AND WENT CRAZY
I GET WET TO MY KNEES WHEN I GO DOWN TO PICK CHERRIES YOU CAN HAVE ONE ANY TIME YOU WANT HIM
SEE HERE SHE BROUGHT OUT AT LAST
MARIE PINED IN THE CONVENT FOR A YEAR UNTIL HER EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY WAS PASSED
SHE'LL BE FOR HAVING THE PIGS SLEEP WITH US NEXT OSCAR GRUNTED AND GOT UP
I NOT CARE HOW MANY MEN SHE TAKE UNDER DAT TREE
DID THEY WEAR MANTILLAS
I'VE BUILT IT UP MYSELF AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU OSCAR SPOKE UP SOLEMNLY
HOW CAN I
OTHER PEOPLES CAN DO LIKE ME
THERE HE SIGHED
FARMERS WHO WERE ALREADY IN DEBT HAD TO GIVE UP THEIR LAND
I WANT TO GO AS SOON AS HARVEST IS OVER
FRANK WAS ALWAYS READING ABOUT THE DOINGS OF RICH PEOPLE AND FEELING OUTRAGED
LIKE THE PLAINS OF LOMBARDY IT SEEMS TO RISE A LITTLE TO MEET THE SUN
HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A CRY SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE SECOND REPORT BUT HE WAS NOT SURE
CARL WALKED RAPIDLY UNTIL HE CAME TO THE CREST OF THE SECOND HILL WHERE THE BERGSON PASTURE JOINED THE ONE THAT HAD BELONGED TO HIS FATHER
NOW ALEXANDRA COULD IN A MEASURE REALIZE THAT MARIE WAS AFTER ALL MARIE
WHILE THE CHURCH WAS FILLING EMIL BERGSON WAITED OUTSIDE WATCHING THE WAGONS AND BUGGIES DRIVE UP THE HILL
I WANT YOU TO SEE EMIL CARL
SHE WAS IN TROUBLE OF SOME SORT BUT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HER
THERE IS MY LITTLE NEIGHBOR NOW
SOMETIMES THEY SEEMED LIKE THE SPARKS FROM A FORGE
THIS WITH HER POKE BONNET GAVE HER THE LOOK OF A QUAINT LITTLE WOMAN
I WONDER WHETHER I SHALL EVER BE ABLE TO TELL YOU ALL THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT UP THERE
I PUT IT IN THE WINDOW TO KEEP COOL THE BOHEMIANS SAID ALEXANDRA AS THEY DREW UP TO THE TABLE CERTAINLY KNOW HOW TO MAKE MORE KINDS OF BREAD THAN ANY OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
WILD ROSES WERE FLAMING IN THE TUFTS OF BUNCHGRASS ALONG THE FENCE
FROM TWO EARS THAT HAD GROWN SIDE BY SIDE THE GRAINS OF ONE SHOT UP JOYFULLY INTO THE LIGHT PROJECTING THEMSELVES INTO THE FUTURE AND THE GRAINS FROM THE OTHER LAY STILL IN THE EARTH AND ROTTED
EMIL KICKED A CLOD FROM THE PATH AND WENT ON I WONDER WHETHER YOU ARE REALLY SHALLOW-HEARTED LIKE YOU SEEM
IN CRAZY IVAR'S COUNTRY THE GRASS WAS SHORT AND GRAY THE DRAWS DEEPER THAN THEY WERE IN THE BERGSONS NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE LAND WAS ALL BROKEN UP INTO HILLOCKS AND CLAY RIDGES
I HAVE TO GO OVER TO THE ENGINE FOR A MINUTE
IT IS SO CURLY THAT FIERY ENDS ESCAPE FROM THE BRAIDS AND MAKE HER HEAD LOOK LIKE ONE OF THE BIG DOUBLE SUNFLOWERS THAT FRINGE HER VEGETABLE GARDEN
YOU DO NOT GET AWAY SO EASY SHE PUT HER HAND AFFECTIONATELY ON HIS SHOULDER
IVAR SIGNA EXCLAIMED AS SHE WIPED THE RAIN FROM HER FACE DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS THE OLD MAN PUT DOWN HIS COBBLER'S KNIFE
SHE WAS STILL GAZING INTO THE WEST AND IN HER FACE THERE WAS THAT EXALTED SERENITY THAT SOMETIMES CAME TO HER AT MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING
FROM THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHECKER-BOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN
BAH HE EXCLAIMED IN DISGUST
THEY HAD PLANNED THAT ALEXANDRA WAS TO COME TO MICHIGAN--A LONG JOURNEY FOR HER--AT CHRISTMAS TIME AND SPEND SEVERAL WEEKS WITH HIM
TERROR WAS THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT HIM FROM GOING BACK TO HER TERROR THAT SHE MIGHT STILL BE SHE THAT SHE MIGHT STILL BE SUFFERING
CHERRY COUNTY
CHERRY COUNTY
BOYS SAID THE FATHER WEARILY I WANT YOU TO KEEP THE LAND TOGETHER AND TO BE GUIDED BY YOUR SISTER
NOT MUCH USE IN THAT IVAR
IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT HE WAS A SICK MAN
I WILL GO NORTH AT ONCE
OH YES YES
COME INTO THE SITTING-ROOM THE OLD MAN FOLLOWED ALEXANDRA BUT WHEN SHE MOTIONED HIM TO A CHAIR HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
DON'T GRUDGE YOUR MOTHER A LITTLE TIME FOR PLOWING HER GARDEN AND SETTING OUT FRUIT TREES EVEN IF IT COMES IN A BUSY SEASON
ALEXANDRA TOO WAS GLAD OF THE DUSK
THEY ARE SUSPICIOUS OF HIM BECAUSE HE'S INTELLIGENT
WELL THE ONLY WAY WE CAN FIND OUT IS TO TRY
EMIL YOU WANNA GET A BOY RIGHT OFF
WHEN HE FELT IT WHIPPING ABOUT IN HIM HE DRANK ALCOHOL TO STUPEFY IT AND GET SOME EASE FOR HIMSELF
EMIL SAW THAT THIS WAS NO TIME TO TALK ABOUT HIS OWN AFFAIRS
MAYBE SHE WAS CUT TO PIECES TOO ALEXANDRA
EMIL SAID HE WOULD UNDERTAKE TO DO THAT
WHEN SHE COMES TO VISIT ME SHE CAN DO ALL THE OLD THINGS IN THE OLD WAY AND HAVE AS MUCH BEER AS SHE WANTS
THE LAND BELONGS TO THE FUTURE CARL
IT HAPPENED TO BE THE FIRST SILO ON THE DIVIDE AND ALEXANDRA'S NEIGHBORS AND HER MEN WERE SKEPTICAL ABOUT IT
AND SHE COULD NOT GO TO ALEXANDRA FOR SYMPATHY
WE HAVEN'T TURNED UP MILLIONS YET BUT WE'VE GOT A START THAT'S WORTH FOLLOWING
SEE MY MOTHER ALEXANDRA TRIED TO WITHDRAW HER HAND BUT FRANK HELD ON TO IT NERVOUSLY
YOU OUGHT TO THINK A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY
WHY NONSENSE EMIL WHY YOU'VE NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING HAVE YOU
THE CHURCH LOOKED POWERFUL AND TRIUMPHANT THERE ON ITS EMINENCE SO HIGH ABOVE THE REST OF THE LANDSCAPE WITH MILES OF WARM COLOR LYING AT ITS FEET AND BY ITS POSITION AND SETTING IT REMINDED ONE OF SOME OF THE CHURCHES BUILT LONG AGO IN THE WHEAT-LANDS OF MIDDLE FRANCE
AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART FRANK KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT IF HE COULD ONCE GIVE UP HIS GRUDGE HIS WIFE WOULD COME BACK TO HIM
SO LIKE EMIL AND SO UNLIKE ANY ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD
WHEN HE LAID HER DOWN ON HER BED AGAIN SHE OPENED HER EYES AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE SHE SAW HIM SAW HIM CLEARLY THOUGH THE ROOM WAS DARK AND HIS FACE WAS COVERED
AT THE HITCH-BARS ALONG THE STREET A FEW HEAVY WORK-HORSES HARNESSED TO FARM WAGONS SHIVERED UNDER THEIR BLANKETS
I TRY TO BE MORE LIBERAL ABOUT SUCH THINGS THAN I USED TO BE
THE BIRDS HAVE GONE
HE LIKES THE CALENDARS I GET HIM IN TOWN
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS ALEXANDRA SHOOK THE TEARS FROM HER EYES AND LAUGHED
I KNOW SHE AFTER SOME OTHER MAN
ANNIE AND LOU SOMETIMES SPEAK SWEDISH AT HOME BUT ANNIE IS ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF BEING CAUGHT AT IT AS EVER HER MOTHER WAS OF BEING CAUGHT BAREFOOT
HE SEEMED SOMEHOW NOT ALTOGETHER HUMAN
OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT
BUT SINCE SHE HAD BEEN HERE THE SOUNDS AND SMELLS IN THE CORRIDOR THE LOOK OF THE MEN IN CONVICTS CLOTHES WHO PASSED THE GLASS DOOR OF THE WARDEN'S OFFICE AFFECTED HER UNPLEASANTLY
ONE SUNDAY LATE IN THE SUMMER AFTER MARIE'S GRADUATION SHE MET FRANK AT A BOHEMIAN PICNIC DOWN THE RIVER AND WENT ROWING WITH HIM ALL THE AFTERNOON
SEEMS TO ME LIKE GOOD TIMES WOULD NEVER COME AGAIN IVAR EXPRESSED HIMSELF IN A DEEP SIGH BUT SAID NOTHING
STOP AMEDEE
THE WINTER TWILIGHT WAS FADING
I DON'T KNOW WHY
IF SHE TELLS YOU TO PUT IN A CROP SHE THINKS SHE'S PUT IT IN
MARIE WALKED ON HER FACE LIFTED TOWARD THE REMOTE INACCESSIBLE EVENING STAR
SOMETIMES OF A WINTER EVENING ALEXANDRA CALLS HIM INTO THE SITTING-ROOM TO READ THE BIBLE ALOUD TO HER FOR HE STILL READS VERY WELL
MOTHER THINKS HE MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING AWFUL WICKED LOU LOOKED BACK AND WINKED AT CARL
CARL HOLDING THE GATE OPEN FOR ALEXANDRA BEGAN TO LAUGH
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL IN WHAT YOU SAY IVAR
BERGSON WENT OVER IN HIS MIND THE THINGS THAT HAD HELD HIM BACK
THE FAILURE OF THE CORN CROP MADE LABOR CHEAP
POOR FRANK GETTING MARRIED WASN'T VERY GOOD FOR HIM EITHER
THERE ARE SO MANY MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO
EMIL TURNED AND WENT INTO THE CHURCH
IN PRINTING THE STORY OF THE YOUNG MAN'S MARITAL TROUBLES THE KNOWING EDITOR GAVE A SUFFICIENTLY COLORED ACCOUNT OF HIS CAREER STATING THE AMOUNT OF HIS INCOME AND THE MANNER IN WHICH HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SPEND IT
UNDER THE OVERHANGING WILLOWS OF THE OPPOSITE BANK THERE WAS AN INLET WHERE THE WATER WAS DEEPER AND FLOWED SO SLOWLY THAT IT SEEMED TO SLEEP IN THE SUN
THAT IS GOOD
HOW DID THE WOMEN DRESS WHEN THEY WENT TO BULL-FIGHTS
I NEVER MEANT TO BE HARD
WHEN HE REACHED THE ORCHARD THE SUN WAS HANGING LOW OVER THE WHEATFIELD
SEEMED GLAD TO BE AT HOME AND TALKED TO HER AS HE USED TO DO
I USED TO SEE YOU IN HANOVER SOMETIMES WHEN UNCLE JOE TOOK ME TO TOWN
ITS GENIUS WAS UNFRIENDLY TO MAN
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE HORSES IVAR
WE'RE GOING TO CRAZY IVAR'S TO BUY A HAMMOCK SURE CARL RAN UP PANTING AND CLAMBERING OVER THE WHEEL SAT DOWN BESIDE EMIL
THEY CUT THE WIND
SHE OUGHT TO BE DOING ALL THAT FOR A SWEETHEART
WAIT A MINUTE ALEXANDRA
ALL AT ONCE IN A SINGLE DAY I LOSE EVERYTHING
THERE WERE SO MANY SHEDS AND OUTBUILDINGS GROUPED ABOUT IT THAT THE PLACE LOOKED NOT UNLIKE A TINY VILLAGE
FREEDOM SO OFTEN MEANS THAT ONE ISN'T NEEDED ANYWHERE
THAT EVENING CARL CAME IN WITH THE BOYS TO SUPPER
THAT'S WHAT THE CROWS SAID BUT HE CURED THEIR HORSES ALL THE SAME
WELL WE HAVE MADE UP OUR MINDS AT LAST ALEXANDRA
THE MINUTES PASSED
WHY HAD SHE BROUGHT THIS UPON HIM
WE THOUGHT WE OUGHT TO TELL YOU THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEGUN TO TALK HE SAID MEANINGLY
NOW MORE THAN EVER YES NOW MORE THAN EVER
A NAME IN HER LAST SENTENCE ROUSED HIM
MARIE THEN WAS NOT COMING
IT PRETENDED TO BE POOR BECAUSE NOBODY KNEW HOW TO WORK IT RIGHT
BUT THE MERE FACT THAT SHE WAS SHABATA'S WIFE FOR ALEXANDRA SETTLED EVERYTHING
SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER,"--HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK,--"SO LIKE A TABLE-CLOTH
I MEANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT
SOME OF THEM LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD BEEN MOVED IN OVERNIGHT AND OTHERS AS IF THEY WERE STRAYING OFF BY THEMSELVES HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE OPEN PLAIN
I DON KNOW WHAT IN HELL MAKE ME TAKE DAT GUN
IT WILL NEVER COME TRUE NOW IN THE WAY I THOUGHT IT MIGHT SHE TOOK CARL'S ARM AND THEY WALKED TOWARD THE GATE
ALL SORTS OF WEEDS AND HERBS AND FLOWERS HAD GROWN UP THERE
ALEXANDRA SAT SEWING BY THE TABLE
MAYBE THERE'S SOME YOUNG LADY IN LINCOLN NOW VERY GRAND,"--AMEDEE WAVED HIS HAND LANGUIDLY BEFORE HIS FACE TO DENOTE THE FAN OF HEARTLESS BEAUTY,--"AND YOU LOST YOUR HEART UP THERE
THEY DROVE WESTWARD TOWARD NORWAY CREEK AND TOWARD A BIG WHITE HOUSE THAT STOOD ON A HILL SEVERAL MILES ACROSS THE FIELDS
BERGSON HIMSELF HAD WORKED IN A SHIPYARD
IT CEASED
MAYBE SHE THOUGHT MY HOUSE WAS A BOAT SHE WAS SUCH A WILD THING
I THINK YOU DID PRETTY WELL BY US EMIL TOOK UP HIS LAMP AND WENT UPSTAIRS
BEFORE ALEXANDRA WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD SHE HAD BEGUN TO BE A HELP TO HIM AND AS SHE GREW OLDER HE HAD COME TO DEPEND MORE AND MORE UPON HER RESOURCEFULNESS AND GOOD JUDGMENT
THE RICH MEN DOWN THERE OWN ALL THE BEST LAND AND THEY ARE BUYING ALL THEY CAN GET
THE THING TO DO IS TO SELL OUR CATTLE AND WHAT LITTLE OLD CORN WE HAVE AND BUY THE LINSTRUM PLACE
AND I ADVISE YOU TO DO WHAT THEY TELL YOU
AS SOON AS I GET THE GIRLS BROKEN IN I MARRY THEM OFF I'VE NO PATIENCE WITH SIGNA MARRYING THAT GRUMPY FELLOW MARIE DECLARED
SHE SIGHED DESPONDENTLY
YUST LIKE-A FEDDERS SHE PRONOUNCED WITH SATISFACTION
THE WAGON JOLTED ALONG OVER THE FROZEN ROAD
ALEXANDRA PATTED HIM
FOR THE OFFERTORY HE SANG GOUNOD'S AVE MARIA,"--ALWAYS SPOKEN OF IN SAINTE-AGNES AS THE AVE MARIA EMIL BEGAN TO TORTURE HIMSELF WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT MARIE
BUT WHEN SHE KNEW HIM WHY HADN'T SHE BEEN MORE CAREFUL
SHE HAD EXPERIMENTED EVEN WITH THE RANK BUFFALO-PEA AND SHE COULD NOT SEE A FINE BRONZE CLUSTER OF THEM WITHOUT SHAKING HER HEAD AND MURMURING WHAT A PITY WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO PRESERVE SHE BEGAN TO PICKLE
HOWEVER SHE ADDED IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU GET ALONG WITH FRANK ABOUT AS WELL AS ANY WOMAN I'VE EVER SEEN OR HEARD OF COULD MARIE SHOOK HER HEAD PURSING HER LIPS AND BLOWING HER WARM BREATH SOFTLY OUT INTO THE FROSTY AIR
I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAYED YOURSELF SHE SPOKE RAPIDLY AND PLEADINGLY LOOKED ENTREATINGLY INTO HIS FACE
BUT SHE HAD SEEMED TO FIND THE PEOPLE QUITE GOOD ENOUGH
SHE SPRANG DOWN AND RAN TOWARD ALEXANDRA STOPPING SHORT AND LOOKING AT HER IN DISAPPOINTMENT
THE IDEA MARIE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS
HE SAYS THE FEED OUTEN IT GIVES THE STOCK THE BLOAT
MY DEAR IT WAS SOMETHING ONE FELT IN THE AIR AS YOU FEEL THE SPRING COMING OR A STORM IN SUMMER
XII CARL CAME INTO THE SITTING-ROOM WHILE ALEXANDRA WAS LIGHTING THE LAMP
THE SUNLIGHT WAS SHINING DIRECTLY IN HER FACE AND THERE WAS A BLAZE OF LIGHT ALL ABOUT THE RED CHURCH ON THE HILL
HE COVETED NOTHING THAT WAS FRANK SHABATA'S
SINCE SHE LIKED PLAIN THINGS HERSELF IT WAS ALL THE MORE NECESSARY TO HAVE JARS AND PUNCHBOWLS AND CANDLESTICKS IN THE COMPANY ROOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO DID APPRECIATE THEM
AND NO ONE KNEW WHEN THEY WERE LIKELY TO COME OR WHY
HE WAS A THIN FRAIL BOY WITH BROODING DARK EYES VERY QUIET IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
ALEXANDRA HAD A LETTER TO HIM FROM THE GERMAN BANKER IN HANOVER
POOR FRANK ALEXANDRA TWIRLED THE STICK IN HER FINGERS AND LAUGHED
HE WAS AT THAT HEIGHT OF EXCITEMENT FROM WHICH EVERYTHING IS FORESHORTENED FROM WHICH LIFE SEEMS SHORT AND SIMPLE DEATH VERY NEAR AND THE SOUL SEEMS TO SOAR LIKE AN EAGLE
AND EMIL BEING GONE WHAT WAS HER LIFE TO BE LIKE
YOU DON'T LOOK AS IF THE WEATHER EVER FROZE YOU UP
III THE NEXT AFTERNOON CARL AND ALEXANDRA WERE WALKING ACROSS THE FIELDS FROM MRS HILLER'S
THEY KNOW YOU WON'T CARE MARIE HURRIED AWAY TO MAKE HIS COFFEE
THE WINDMILL SINGING IN THE BRISK BREEZE EMIL WHISTLING AS HE BLACKED HIS BOOTS DOWN BY THE KITCHEN DOOR
THE CHOIR HAD NEVER SUNG SO WELL AND RAOUL MARCEL IN THE GLORIA DREW EVEN THE BISHOP'S EYES TO THE ORGAN LOFT
IT'S TOO HIGH TO FARM UP HERE
BEFORE HE LEFT CALIFORNIA HE SENT ME A BOX OF ORANGE FLOWERS BUT THEY DIDN'T KEEP VERY WELL
HE HAD BEEN MORE LIKE HIMSELF SINCE HE GOT BACK FROM MEXICO
I FEEL AS IF THIS TREE KNOWS EVERYTHING I EVER THINK OF WHEN I SIT HERE
I KNOW THAT'S ALL
I EVEN IF YOU CAN KEEP A SECRET,"--CARL LEANED FORWARD AND TOUCHED HER ARM SMILING,--"I EVEN THINK I LIKED THE OLD COUNTRY BETTER
HE PUT THE MARE IN HER STALL THREW HER A MEASURE OF OATS AND THEN SET OUT AS FAST AS HIS BOW-LEGS COULD CARRY HIM ON THE PATH TO THE NEAREST NEIGHBOR
THE WORK SHE COULD DO HERSELF IF IT WERE NECESSARY
GO TO TOWN AND ASK YOUR LAWYERS WHAT YOU CAN DO TO RESTRAIN ME FROM DISPOSING OF MY OWN PROPERTY
LOU'S WIFE WAS TELLING ME ABOUT THE WAY SHE SPOILS YOU
HE WAS BAREFOOT BUT HE WORE A CLEAN SHIRT OF UNBLEACHED COTTON OPEN AT THE NECK
HIS BLACK CLOTH COAT WAS MUCH TOO BIG FOR HIM AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A LITTLE OLD MAN
CARL HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN LITTLE MARIE TOVESKY'S EYES AND HE WAS GLAD TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THEM
HE KNEW THAT HE WAS DOING HER WRONG
TRY NOT TO WORRY CARL SPRANG TO THE GROUND AND RAN OFF ACROSS THE FIELDS TOWARD THE LINSTRUM HOMESTEAD
A BIG WHITE BIRD WITH LONG WINGS AND PINK FEET
WAIT A MINUTE CARL THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS LOWERED HIS HEAD AND DARTED UP THE STREET AGAINST THE NORTH WIND
I'D LIKE TO KNOW I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW LINDENS ARE
THEY WERE ALL BIG CHILDREN TOGETHER AND THEY FOUND THE ADVENTURES OF THE FAMILY IN THE TREE HOUSE SO ABSORBING THAT THEY GAVE THEM THEIR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION
BUT THAT AS EMIL HIMSELF HAD MORE THAN ONCE REFLECTED WAS ALEXANDRA'S BLIND SIDE AND HER LIFE HAD NOT BEEN OF THE KIND TO SHARPEN HER VISION
WE LIVE IN THE STREETS IN THE PARKS IN THE THEATRES
ON SUNDAY MORNING THE BISHOP WAS TO DRIVE OVERLAND TO SAINTE-AGNES FROM HANOVER AND EMIL BERGSON HAD BEEN ASKED TO TAKE THE PLACE OF ONE OF AMEDEE'S COUSINS IN THE CAVALCADE OF FORTY FRENCH BOYS WHO WERE TO RIDE ACROSS COUNTRY TO MEET THE BISHOP'S CARRIAGE
I'LL PUT THAT AWAY SHE POKED THE CANE BEHIND FRANK'S SUNDAY CLOTHES AND THOUGH SHE LAUGHED ALEXANDRA SAW THERE WERE TEARS IN HER EYES
SHE WENT OUT TO THE CART WITH THEM AND TUCKED THE ROBES ABOUT OLD MRS LEE WHILE ALEXANDRA TOOK THE BLANKET OFF HER HORSE
NOW THAT I'VE BEEN OUT IN IT WITH HIM I SHAN'T DREAD IT
FRANK LIFTED HIS HEAD
SHE SIMPLY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO GIVE A HALF-HEARTED RESPONSE
WHEN THE EYES OF THE FLESH ARE SHUT THE EYES OF THE SPIRIT ARE OPEN
EVERYTHING WILL COME ON YOU I WILL DO ALL I CAN FATHER DON'T LET THEM GET DISCOURAGED AND GO OFF LIKE UNCLE OTTO
THEY WILL FEEL SAFER WITH THOSE COWS IN THEIR OWN STABLE
I'M FRIENDLY WITH ALL MY NEIGHBORS I HOPE
HE FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING INDECOROUS IN HER PROPOSAL AND SHE DID SEEM TO HIM SOMEWHAT RIDICULOUS
I NEVER HIT MY WIFE
WHEN IVAR REACHED THE PATH BY THE HEDGE HE SAW SHABATA'S RIFLE LYING IN THE WAY
HE FELT IT RATHER THAN SAW IT
ON THE DIVIDE FARMERS DAUGHTERS NO LONGER WENT OUT INTO SERVICE SO ALEXANDRA GOT HER GIRLS FROM SWEDEN BY PAYING THEIR FARE OVER
I THINK WE SHALL BE VERY HAPPY
ALEXANDRA HE SAID IN A LOW TONE LOOKING STEADILY AT THE BUTTON YOU AIN T'INK I USE DAT GIRL AWFUL BAD BEFORE NO FRANK
A STRANGER APPROACHING IT COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THE BEAUTY AND FRUITFULNESS OF THE OUTLYING FIELDS
HIS SPIRIT WENT OUT OF HIS BODY AND CROSSED THE FIELDS TO MARIE SHABATA
CAN'T YOU SEE EMIL STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT HER HOLDING HIS SHOULDERS STIFF AND STIFFENING THE ARM TO WHICH SHE CLUNG
HE CLOSED THE BOOK ON HIS KNEE KEEPING THE PLACE WITH HIS HORNY FINGER AND REPEATED SOFTLY HE SENDETH THE SPRINGS INTO THE VALLEYS WHICH RUN AMONG THE HILLS
DROUTH CHINCE-BUGS HAIL EVERYTHING
CARL WAS INTERESTED
II EMIL REACHED HOME A LITTLE PAST NOON AND WHEN HE WENT INTO THE KITCHEN ALEXANDRA WAS ALREADY SEATED AT THE HEAD OF THE LONG TABLE HAVING DINNER WITH HER MEN AS SHE ALWAYS DID UNLESS THERE WERE VISITORS
HE CROSSED THE FENCE INTO THE PASTURE THAT WAS NOW THE SHABATAS AND CONTINUED HIS WALK TOWARD THE POND
THAT'S WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO AMEDEE STAGGERED UP WITH A GESTURE OF DESPAIR
I'M GOING HOME ALONE EMIL SO YOU NEEDN'T GET YOUR HAT SHE SAID AS SHE WOUND HER SCARF QUICKLY ABOUT HER HEAD
WHEN SHE WAS DELIGHTED SHE WAS AS LIKELY AS NOT TO STAND ON HER TIP-TOES AND CLAP HER HANDS
AS THEY EMERGED FROM THE SHED A STREAM OF WATER RUNNING OFF THE THATCH STRUCK THE MARE ON THE NECK
SHE HATED TO SEE THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPERS COME INTO THE HOUSE
IV CARL HAD CHANGED ALEXANDRA FELT MUCH LESS THAN ONE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED
WHEN HE DID NOT COME BACK ALEXANDRA THREW A SHAWL OVER HER HEAD AND RAN DOWN THE PATH TO THE WINDMILL
JUST LIKE SOLDIERS WHO HAVE BEEN DRILLED ALEXANDRA HAD SELECTED HER HAMMOCK BY THE TIME THE BOYS CAME UP FROM THE POND
YEARS AGO HE HIMSELF HAD HAD THE POWER TO TAKE THE BLOOD FROM HER CHEEKS LIKE THAT
THE OTHER HANDS FOLLOWED THEM ALL EXCEPT OLD IVAR
I AM A FORTUNE HUNTER
HE WAS WITH HER A LONG WHILE THIS TIME AND CARRIED HER VERY FAR AND IN HIS ARMS SHE FELT FREE FROM PAIN
IT WAS A MAN CERTAINLY WHO CARRIED HER BUT HE WAS LIKE NO MAN SHE KNEW
THERE WAS SOMETHING PLEASANTLY UNUSUAL ABOUT IT AND ABOUT IVAR
YOU WON'T HAVE TO PAY OFF YOUR MORTGAGES FOR SIX YEARS
ARE YOU STUCK UP EMIL OR IS ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH YOU
YES HIS EYES AVOIDED HERS
HER GUESTS LIKED TO SEE ABOUT THEM THESE REASSURING EMBLEMS OF PROSPERITY
THE WILD FLOWERS DISAPPEARED AND ONLY IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DRAWS AND GULLIES GREW A FEW OF THE VERY TOUGHEST AND HARDIEST
I'M AFRAID THEY ARE BEGINNING TO FEEL HARD TOWARD ME BECAUSE I WON'T LISTEN TO ANY TALK ABOUT GOING
YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT
CARL SAID ALEXANDRA I SHOULD LIKE TO GO UP THERE WITH YOU IN THE SPRING
FROM THE TIME THE SHABATAS HAD FIRST MOVED TO THE NEIGHBORING FARM SHE HAD OMITTED NO OPPORTUNITY OF THROWING MARIE AND EMIL TOGETHER
MY GOD GIRL WHAT A HEAD OF HAIR HE EXCLAIMED QUITE INNOCENTLY AND FOOLISHLY
THERE WERE CERTAIN DAYS IN HER LIFE OUTWARDLY UNEVENTFUL WHICH ALEXANDRA REMEMBERED AS PECULIARLY HAPPY
THE DEAD ARE IN PARADISE THEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD FOR HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT EMIL WAS IN PARADISE
HE WAS SHOT IN THE HEART AND HAD ROLLED OVER ON HIS BACK AND DIED
ALEXANDRA OFTEN SAID THAT IF HER MOTHER WERE CAST UPON A DESERT ISLAND SHE WOULD THANK GOD FOR HER DELIVERANCE MAKE A GARDEN AND FIND SOMETHING TO PRESERVE
THE PRAIRIE-DOG KEEPS HIS HOLE
THE BRANCHES HAD BECOME SO HARD THAT THEY WOUNDED YOUR HAND IF YOU BUT TRIED TO BREAK A TWIG
SHE SAW THE LIGHT FROM MY WINDOW AND DARTED UP TO IT
AND ALEXANDRA MUST NOT WORK IN THE FIELDS ANY MORE
HE ALWAYS SAID THAT THE BADGERS HAD CLEANER HOUSES THAN PEOPLE AND THAT WHEN HE TOOK A HOUSEKEEPER HER NAME WOULD BE MRS BADGER
ALEXANDRA HATED TO THINK SO
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT LAND IS GOING TO GO UP ENOUGH TO PAY THE MORTGAGES AND AND MAKE US RICH BESIDES ALEXANDRA PUT IN FIRMLY
THERE WERE DAYS TOO WHICH SHE AND EMIL HAD SPENT TOGETHER UPON WHICH SHE LOVED TO LOOK BACK
AMEDEE CHEVALIER A PROUD FATHER OF ONE WEEK RUSHED OUT AND EMBRACED EMIL
IT REACHED HER BEFORE SHE COULD SHUT IT OUT AND HID ITSELF IN HER HEART
IT WAS ONLY FIVE O'CLOCK OF A MID-OCTOBER DAY BUT A STORM HAD COME UP IN THE AFTERNOON BRINGING BLACK CLOUDS A COLD WIND AND TORRENTS OF RAIN
I'M GOING THERE TO GET RICH
SHE HAD SCARCELY THOUGHT ABOUT WHERE SHE WAS GOING WHEN THE POND GLITTERED BEFORE HER WHERE EMIL HAD SHOT THE DUCKS
THE STRANGER NODDED TO HIS DRIVER DROPPED HIS SUITCASE INSIDE THE FENCE AND OPENED THE GATE
BUT SHE STILL HAS THE SAME CALMNESS AND DELIBERATION OF MANNER THE SAME CLEAR EYES AND SHE STILL WEARS HER HAIR IN TWO BRAIDS WOUND ROUND HER HEAD
HE WANTED HIS WIFE TO RESENT THAT HE WAS WASTING HIS BEST YEARS AMONG THESE STUPID AND UNAPPRECIATIVE PEOPLE
THE TWO FRIENDS STOOD FOR A FEW MOMENTS ON THE WINDY STREET CORNER NOT SPEAKING A WORD AS TWO TRAVELERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR WAY SOMETIMES STAND AND ADMIT THEIR PERPLEXITY IN SILENCE
THEY GREW FAINTER AND THICKER AS IF SHE WERE CHOKING
YOU SEE LOU THAT FULLER HAS A HEAD ON HIM
BUT YOU CAN GO AWAY
OF COURSE HE REFLECTED HOPEFULLY AND INCONSISTENTLY ALEXANDRA AIN'T MUCH LIKE OTHER WOMEN-FOLKS
I DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD KEPT IT
HE DIDN'T SEE THE USE OF MAKING A FUSS OVER A FELLOW JUST BECAUSE HE WAS DRESSED LIKE A CLOWN
I NO CAN T'INK WITHOUT MY HAIR HE COMPLAINED
OTHER NIGHTS I ONLY PUT NEWSPAPERS BEHIND THEM
II ON ONE OF THE RIDGES OF THAT WINTRY WASTE STOOD THE LOW LOG HOUSE IN WHICH JOHN BERGSON WAS DYING
HE OFTEN CALLED HIS DAUGHTER IN TO TALK TO HER ABOUT THIS
THEY WERE JUST THE SAME BOYS HE TOLD HIMSELF HE HAD NOT BEEN MISTAKEN IN THEM
THE LITTLE TOWN BEHIND THEM HAD VANISHED AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN HAD FALLEN BEHIND THE SWELL OF THE PRAIRIE AND THE STERN FROZEN COUNTRY RECEIVED THEM INTO ITS BOSOM
HE WORKED LIKE AN INSECT ALWAYS DOING THE SAME THING OVER IN THE SAME WAY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS BEST OR NO
OFTEN HE DID NOT SEE ANYBODY FROM ONE WEEK'S END TO ANOTHER
HE STOOD LIKE THE HARE WHEN THE DOGS ARE APPROACHING FROM ALL SIDES
SOMETIMES HE IS SO LIKE FATHER THAT HE FRIGHTENS ME
YOU KNOW I MOST FORGIT DAT WOMAN'S NAME
THE SWEDISH WOMAN SO WHITE AND GOLD KINDLY AND AMUSED BUT ARMORED IN CALM AND THE ALERT BROWN ONE HER FULL LIPS PARTED POINTS OF YELLOW LIGHT DANCING IN HER EYES AS SHE LAUGHED AND CHATTERED
I SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF YOU WANTED TO
HIS OWN ORIGINAL HOMESTEAD AND TIMBER CLAIM MAKING THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ACRES AND THE HALF-SECTION ADJOINING THE HOMESTEAD OF A YOUNGER BROTHER WHO HAD GIVEN UP THE FIGHT GONE BACK TO CHICAGO TO WORK IN A FANCY BAKERY AND DISTINGUISH HIMSELF IN A SWEDISH ATHLETIC CLUB
THEY MAKE AN ORCHARD GROW IF THEY CAN'T MAKE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT THROUGH THE CHURCH ON EARTH HE HAD PASSED TO THE CHURCH TRIUMPHANT THE GOAL OF THE HOPES AND FAITH OF SO MANY HUNDRED YEARS
SHE HAS GOT ON GOOD AND SHE'S GOING TO PLAY FOR HER COMMENCEMENT WHEN SHE GRADUATES IN TOWN NEXT YEAR YES SAID ALEXANDRA FIRMLY I THINK MILLY DESERVES A PIANO
LINSTRUM AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT VERY WELL EMIL
SHE WILL HAVE A MESSAGE FROM THOSE WHO ARE GONE AND THAT WILL BRING HER PEACE
HE BELONGED TO SOME KIND OF A MUSICAL SOCIETY A MALE CHORUS IN STOCKHOLM
MEDEE THERE YOU SEE YOUR MEDEE ISN'T EVEN BIG ENOUGH TO GET YOU AWAY FROM ME
HIS UNHAPPY TEMPERAMENT WAS LIKE A CAGE
AS HE GLANCED AT THE LETTER MR SCHWARTZ PUT AWAY HIS PIPE
ALL THE AMERICANS ARE SKINNING OUT
I HAVEN'T COME UP HERE TO BLAME YOU FRANK
THE FIRST OF THESE FRUITLESS SUMMERS THE BERGSON BOYS BORE COURAGEOUSLY
MARIE WAS HIS YOUNGEST CHILD BY A SECOND WIFE AND WAS THE APPLE OF HIS EYE
EVER SINCE SHE LAST SAW HIM IN THE COURTROOM FRANK'S HAGGARD FACE AND WILD EYES HAD HAUNTED HER
NOTHING WILL CONVINCE YOU LIKE SEEING WITH YOUR OWN EYES
IT WAS THE HOUR FOR SAYING GOOD-BYE
I KNEW WELL ENOUGH I OUGHT NOT TO TELL UNCLE JOE I WANTED IT FOR HE HAD JUST COME BACK FROM THE SALOON AND WAS FEELING GOOD
HOW DIRECT YOU ARE ALEXANDRA
THE CONFIRMATION SERVICE FOLLOWED THE MASS
THE HEAT HAD MADE THE LITTLE BOY SLEEPY BUT HE STILL CLUNG TO HIS KITTEN
FROM SEATTLE I GO ON TO ALASKA ALASKA SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
SUCH-A MUCH FLOWER
EMIL HAD BEEN THERE WHEN THEY CARRIED HIM OUT OF THE FIELD AND HAD STAYED WITH HIM UNTIL THE DOCTORS OPERATED FOR APPENDICITIS AT FIVE O'CLOCK
HE CAME TO DOCTOR OUR MARE WHEN SHE ATE GREEN CORN AND SWELLED UP MOST AS BIG AS THE WATER-TANK
THE BOHEMIANS ALWAYS LIKE THEM WITH THEIR COFFEE
THE OLD WILD COUNTRY THE STRUGGLE IN WHICH HIS SISTER WAS DESTINED TO SUCCEED WHILE SO MANY MEN BROKE THEIR HEARTS AND DIED HE CAN SCARCELY REMEMBER
AFTER YOU ONCE GET COLD CLEAR THROUGH THE FEELING OF THE RAIN ON YOU IS SWEET
WHEN I GET BIG I'LL CLIMB AND GET LITTLE BOYS KITTENS FOR THEM HE MURMURED DROWSILY
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR NEW BATHTUB
HE IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF US HOW DIFFERENT OH YOU'LL SEE
I NEVER DID MEAN TO DO NOT'ING TO DAT WOMAN HE MUTTERED
I THINK IT'S WEAKENING TO STAY IN AS LONG AS HE DOES
WHEN MRS LEE HAD BEEN WITH ALEXANDRA FOR A WEEK MARIE SHABATA TELEPHONED ONE MORNING TO SAY THAT FRANK HAD GONE TO TOWN FOR THE DAY AND SHE WOULD LIKE THEM TO COME OVER FOR COFFEE IN THE AFTERNOON
AMEDEE WAS AN ONLY SON,--HENCE HE WAS A VERY RICH YOUNG MAN,--BUT HE MEANT TO HAVE TWENTY CHILDREN HIMSELF LIKE HIS UNCLE XAVIER
I THOUGHT PEOPLE WENT UP THERE IN THE SPRING THEY DO
SHE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED IN HIM AS SHE HAD BELIEVED IN THE LAND
NOT MERELY A MARRIED WOMAN SOMETIMES WHEN ALEXANDRA THOUGHT OF HER IT WAS WITH AN ACHING TENDERNESS
I'LL BE DRESSED IN A MOMENT ALEXANDRA CLOSED HER DOOR AND EMIL SANK DOWN ON THE OLD SLAT LOUNGE AND SAT WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS
I CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT HIM BEFORE HE GOT SICK OH NOT AT ALL ALEXANDRA DROPPED HER SEWING ON HER KNEE
HER LETTER HAD NEVER REACHED HIM
THERE'S NO QUESTION OF THAT MOTHER
I CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT LOU
WHEN I COME BACK TO IT I NEVER HAVE TO REMIND IT OF ANYTHING
SHE HAD NOT THE LEAST SPARK OF CLEVERNESS
BESIDE ALEXANDRA LOUNGED A STRIKINGLY EXOTIC FIGURE IN A TALL MEXICAN HAT A SILK SASH AND A BLACK VELVET JACKET SEWN WITH SILVER BUTTONS
IT SEEMED TO COME CLOSER TO HER AND TO FILL AN EMPTINESS THAT ACHED IN HER HEART
SHE WAS A GOOD MOTHER BUT SHE WAS GLAD WHEN HER CHILDREN WERE OLD ENOUGH NOT TO BE IN HER WAY IN THE KITCHEN
WHAT A NICE VOICE THAT BOY HAD AND HOW POLITE HE WAS
TALK OF THAT KIND MIGHT COME TOO HIGH YOU KNOW
HE HAD AN IDEA THAT NO ONE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO FARM IT PROPERLY AND THIS HE OFTEN DISCUSSED WITH ALEXANDRA
ALEXANDRA SPOKE TO THE OLD MAN AS THEY JOGGED ALONG THROUGH THE SULLEN GRAY TWILIGHT OF THE STORM
SHE TOOK ME IN AND SHOWED ME THE THING AND SHE TOLD ME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO WASH YOURSELF CLEAN IN IT BECAUSE IN SO MUCH WATER YOU COULD NOT MAKE A STRONG SUDS
BY THAT TIME ANY OF THIS LAND WILL BE WORTH THIRTY DOLLARS AN ACRE--IT WILL BE WORTH FIFTY BUT WE'LL SAY THIRTY
SHE KNEW LONG PORTIONS OF THE FRITHJOF SAGA BY HEART AND LIKE MOST SWEDES WHO READ AT ALL SHE WAS FOND OF LONGFELLOW'S VERSE,--THE BALLADS AND THE GOLDEN LEGEND AND THE SPANISH STUDENT TO-DAY SHE SAT IN THE WOODEN ROCKING-CHAIR WITH THE SWEDISH BIBLE OPEN ON HER KNEES BUT SHE WAS NOT READING
BUT HERE IF A MAN IS DIFFERENT IN HIS FEET OR IN HIS HEAD THEY PUT HIM IN THE ASYLUM
CARL ALEXANDRA EXPLAINED IS ON HIS WAY TO SEATTLE
WE THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT AND LET THEM ALONE
I HAPPENED TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAW HER GOING ACROSS THE FIELDS IN HER THIN DRESS AND SUN-HAT
HE MAY BURN ANYBODY'S BARN
THE SHAGGY COAT OF THE PRAIRIE WHICH THEY LIFTED TO MAKE HIM A BED HAS VANISHED FOREVER
HE DID WORK
WHERE THE BIRDS MAKE THEIR NESTS
THEY WERE AFRAID IT WAS TOO LATE TO DO MUCH GOOD
HOW COULD I HELP IT
MUCH WORSE MOANED MRS BERGSON
HOW ABOUT LOU AND OSCAR
HE DROPPED ON HIS KNEES BESIDE THE HEDGE AND CROUCHED LIKE A RABBIT LISTENING
AS SOON AS FRANK WAS GONE MARIE TELEPHONED ALEXANDRA
THEY WERE SITTING CLOSE TOGETHER AND HE SOMEHOW FELT THAT SHE COULD HEAR HIS THOUGHTS
JUST NOW HE WAS TOO UNHAPPY TO CARE WHO LAUGHED
THEY COME TO IT AND ARE NOT DISTURBED
ONE COULD EASILY BELIEVE THAT IN THAT DEAD LANDSCAPE THE GERMS OF LIFE AND FRUITFULNESS WERE EXTINCT FOREVER
COME THE HORSES ARE DONE EATING
NO NEVER I HURT HER WHEN SHE DEVIL ME SOMETHING AWFUL HE STRUCK HIS FIST DOWN ON THE WARDEN'S DESK SO HARD THAT HE AFTERWARD STROKED IT ABSENTLY
HOW SHE COULD HAVE HELPED KNOWING THAT THEY MUST
SHE HAD A WAY OF MAKING THE BEST OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO HIM A SENTIMENTAL AFFECTATION
IVAR NEVER DRANK AND ALEXANDRA THOUGHT AT ONCE THAT ONE OF HIS SPELLS HAD COME UPON HIM AND THAT HE MUST BE IN A VERY BAD WAY INDEED
WE NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D DO ANYTHING FOOLISH ALEXANDRA RAPPED IMPATIENTLY ON HER DESK WITH HER KNUCKLES
MRS BERGSON MUST HAVE LOOKED JUST LIKE THIS WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL
BUT SHE MUST BE GAY
AFTER WE FIRST CAME OUT HERE I USED TO DREAM SOMETIMES ABOUT THE SHIPYARD WHERE FATHER WORKED AND A LITTLE SORT OF INLET FULL OF MASTS ALEXANDRA PAUSED
THERE WAS ABOUT ALEXANDRA SOMETHING OF THE IMPERVIOUS CALM OF THE FATALIST ALWAYS DISCONCERTING TO VERY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CANNOT FEEL THAT THE HEART LIVES AT ALL UNLESS IT IS STILL AT THE MERCY OF STORMS
LOU AND OSCAR CAN'T SEE THOSE THINGS SAID ALEXANDRA SUDDENLY
I WISH WE COULD KEEP HIS MIND OFF SUCH THINGS BUT I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO BE WITH HIM NOW I WONDER IF HE'D LIKE TO HAVE ME BRING MY MAGIC LANTERN OVER SOME EVENING ALEXANDRA TURNED HER FACE TOWARD HIM
RESTING THE BUTT OF HIS GUN ON THE GROUND HE PARTED THE MULBERRY LEAVES SOFTLY WITH HIS FINGERS AND PEERED THROUGH THE HEDGE AT THE DARK FIGURES ON THE GRASS IN THE SHADOW OF THE MULBERRY TREE
AS FOR THE STORK THE FIR TREES ARE HER HOUSE
THE DRY GARDEN PATCH SMELLED OF DRYING VINES AND WAS STREWN WITH YELLOW SEED-CUCUMBERS AND PUMPKINS AND CITRONS
NOW GO INTO THE STORE WITH HER EMIL AND GET WARM HE OPENED THE DOOR FOR THE CHILD
I BEGIN JUST WHERE I LEFT OFF EMIL HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO THIS
OUR PEOPLE WERE BETTER PEOPLE THAN THESE IN THE OLD COUNTRY
WHILE IVAR WAS HURRYING ACROSS THE FIELDS THE FIRST LONG RAYS OF THE SUN WERE REACHING DOWN BETWEEN THE ORCHARD BOUGHS TO THOSE TWO DEW-DRENCHED FIGURES
THAT IS ALL AMONG THE DIM THINGS OF CHILDHOOD AND HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN IN THE BRIGHTER PATTERN LIFE WEAVES TO-DAY IN THE BRIGHT FACTS OF BEING CAPTAIN OF THE TRACK TEAM AND HOLDING THE INTERSTATE RECORD FOR THE HIGH JUMP IN THE ALL-SUFFUSING BRIGHTNESS OF BEING TWENTY-ONE
I'LL SHOW YOU WHETHER I HAVE TO HUMP MYSELF LAUGHING AND PANTING HE PICKED ANGELIQUE UP IN HIS ARMS AND BEGAN RUNNING ABOUT THE RECTANGLE WITH HER
THEY FELT THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO BE SUPERIOR WITH THEM
THEN HE WENT THROUGH THE HOUSE AGAIN UPSTAIRS AND DOWN WITH NO BETTER RESULT
THEY COULDN'T GET AHEAD EVEN IN GOOD YEARS AND THEY ALL GOT INTO DEBT WHILE FATHER WAS GETTING OUT
THE CHANCE THAT FATHER WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR HAS COME LOU WAS PACING THE FLOOR
THE MAIN STREET WAS A DEEPLY RUTTED ROAD NOW FROZEN HARD WHICH RAN FROM THE SQUAT RED RAILWAY STATION AND THE GRAIN ELEVATOR AT THE NORTH END OF THE TOWN TO THE LUMBER YARD AND THE HORSE POND AT THE SOUTH END
COULD HE RISE FROM BENEATH IT HE WOULD NOT KNOW THE COUNTRY UNDER WHICH HE HAS BEEN ASLEEP
A MAN GOT OUT AND STOOD TALKING TO THE DRIVER
HOW IN THE WORLD HAVE YOU DONE IT
I LEFT IT IN THE DRUG STORE
THE SICK MAN WAS FEELING THIS AS HE LAY LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD LEFT HIM ON THE DAY FOLLOWING ALEXANDRA'S TRIP TO TOWN
YES MOTHER I'M GOING TO CLEAR THE TABLE NOW ALEXANDRA ROSE
WHEREVER THOSE ASHES-OF-ROSE BALLS HUNG ON THEIR MILKY STALKS THE AIR ABOUT THEM WAS SATURATED WITH THEIR BREATH
SHE HAD HER SUPPER EARLY WEARING HER HAT AND BLACK JACKET DOWN TO THE DINING-ROOM AND CARRYING HER HANDBAG
WHEN HE HEARD STEPS APPROACHING IN THE CORRIDOR HE ROSE BLOTTED HIS BOOK PUT HIS PEN IN THE RACK AND LEFT THE ROOM WITHOUT RAISING HIS EYES
OVERTAXED BY EXCITEMENT AND SORROW AS HE WAS THE RAPTURE OF THE SERVICE TOOK HOLD UPON HIS BODY AND MIND
THE FELLOWS THAT SETTLED UP HERE JUST MADE A MISTAKE
THEY'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO CATCH ME UP
AT ONE END OF THE POND WAS AN EARTHEN DAM PLANTED WITH GREEN WILLOW BUSHES AND ABOVE IT A DOOR AND A SINGLE WINDOW WERE SET INTO THE HILLSIDE
BUT MARIE IS REALLY A COMPANION SOME ONE I CAN TALK TO QUITE FRANKLY
MARIE BEGAN TO TAKE DOWN AND FOLD HER SHAWLS
OH IT WORKS SOMETHING GRAND
ONCE IT HAD GONE OFF WHILE THEY WERE STRUGGLING OVER IT
HE WAS A QUIET MAN BUT HE WAS VERY INTELLIGENT
THAT SEEMED REASONABLE ENOUGH
LOU AND OSCAR WERE INDUSTRIOUS BUT HE COULD NEVER TEACH THEM TO USE THEIR HEADS ABOUT THEIR WORK
STILL HE HAD HOPE
THAT WAS JUST AS WELL
THE YEARS SEEMED TO STRETCH BEFORE HER LIKE THE LAND
SHE HAD NO DOUBT THAT HIS WANDERING FIT WAS OVER AND THAT HE WOULD SOON BE SETTLED IN LIFE
NOT UNTIL HE SAW MARIE SHABATA'S TIGER EYES FLASHING FROM THE GLOOM OF THE BASEMENT DOORWAY DID HE HAND THE DISHEVELED BRIDE OVER TO HER HUSBAND
EMIL AND FRANK SHABATA WERE BOTH GUESTS OF OLD MOISE MARCEL
I CAN'T GO AND ONE OF US MUST
AS SHE LAY WITH HER EYES CLOSED SHE HAD AGAIN MORE VIVIDLY THAN FOR MANY YEARS THE OLD ILLUSION OF HER GIRLHOOD OF BEING LIFTED AND CARRIED LIGHTLY BY SOME ONE VERY STRONG
I THINK WE OUGHT TO HOLD ON AS LONG AS WE CAN ON FATHER'S ACCOUNT
HOW MANY OF THE NAMES ON THE COUNTY CLERK'S PLAT WILL BE THERE IN FIFTY YEARS
FRANK SEEMED TO HAVE UNDERGONE A CHANGE OF PERSONALITY
THEY ARE VERY ANGRY WITH ME EMIL
SHE WAS GREATLY IMPRESSED BY CARL'S URBAN APPEARANCE AND IN HER EXCITEMENT TALKED VERY LOUD AND THREW HER HEAD ABOUT
HE HAD A LIVELY BLUE EYE A THIN FAIR SKIN ALWAYS BURNED RED TO THE NECKBAND OF HIS SHIRT IN SUMMER STIFF YELLOW HAIR THAT WOULD NOT LIE DOWN ON HIS HEAD AND A BRISTLY LITTLE YELLOW MUSTACHE OF WHICH HE WAS VERY PROUD
IN COLD WEATHER HE SITS BY THE KITCHEN FIRE AND MAKES HAMMOCKS OR MENDS HARNESS UNTIL IT IS TIME TO GO TO BED
SHE WAS MORE MOURNFUL THAN OUR BIRDS HERE
ALEXANDRA HAD TAKEN OFF HER BLACK TRAVELING SUIT AND PUT ON A WHITE DRESS
NOW YOU'RE WINDY MEDEE
HE STOOD LOOKING AT THE CARPET HIS BUSHY HEAD BOWED HIS HANDS CLASPED IN FRONT OF HIM
EMIL FOR ALL HIS TRACK PRACTICE DID NOT STAND UP UNDER FARMWORK VERY WELL AND BY NIGHT HE WAS TOO TIRED TO TALK OR EVEN TO PRACTISE ON HIS CORNET
I MUST MAKE THE USUAL EFFORT
THE BROWN IRIS HAD GOLDEN GLINTS THAT MADE THEM LOOK LIKE GOLD-STONE OR IN SOFTER LIGHTS LIKE THAT COLORADO MINERAL CALLED TIGER-EYE
THEY FELT THAT HE WAS TOO INTENSE AND PREOCCUPIED
IF ONE STOOD IN THE DOORWAY OF HIS CAVE AND LOOKED OFF AT THE ROUGH LAND THE SMILING SKY THE CURLY GRASS WHITE IN THE HOT SUNLIGHT
ABOUT CARL LINSTRUM
DURING THE WEEK SHE READ ONLY THE NEWSPAPER BUT ON SUNDAY AND IN THE LONG EVENINGS OF WINTER SHE READ A GOOD DEAL
BUT WHEN ALL WAS SAID HE HAD COME UP FROM THE SEA HIMSELF HAD BUILT UP A PROUD LITTLE BUSINESS WITH NO CAPITAL BUT HIS OWN SKILL AND FORESIGHT AND HAD PROVED HIMSELF A MAN
ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS ROAD STRAGGLED TWO UNEVEN ROWS OF WOODEN BUILDINGS
HOW HAVE YOUR NEIGHBORS DONE IT WE HADN'T ANY OF US MUCH TO DO WITH IT CARL
THEY GIVE DRINK TO EVERY BEAST OF THE FIELD
SHE HAD THREE JOLLY OLD TEETH LEFT IN THE FRONT OF HER MOUTH AND WHEN SHE GRINNED SHE LOOKED VERY KNOWING AS IF WHEN YOU FOUND OUT HOW TO TAKE IT LIFE WASN'T HALF BAD
HE DISLIKES HUMAN HABITATIONS SO ALEXANDRA HAS FITTED HIM UP A ROOM IN THE BARN WHERE HE IS VERY COMFORTABLE BEING NEAR THE HORSES AND AS HE SAYS FURTHER FROM TEMPTATIONS
ALEXANDRA'S NEVER BEEN IN LOVE YOU CRAZY HE LAUGHED AGAIN
AMEDEE THE NEWLY MARRIED EMIL'S BEST FRIEND WAS THEIR PITCHER RENOWNED AMONG THE COUNTRY TOWNS FOR HIS DASH AND SKILL
SHE STABBED HIM WITH A GLANCE OF AMAZONIAN FIERCENESS AND DREW IN HER LOWER LIP--MOST UNNECESSARY SEVERITY
SHE SAID THAT ANYTHING AS BIG AS THE BRIDGES OVER THE PLATTE AND THE MISSOURI RECONCILED HER
HE SPECULATED LOST HIS OWN FORTUNE AND FUNDS ENTRUSTED TO HIM BY POOR SEAFARING MEN AND DIED DISGRACED LEAVING HIS CHILDREN NOTHING
HER FACE IS ALWAYS TANNED IN SUMMER FOR HER SUNBONNET IS OFTENER ON HER ARM THAN ON HER HEAD
IN THE MORNING WHEN EMIL CAME DOWN-STAIRS ALEXANDRA MET HIM IN THE SITTING-ROOM AND PUT HER HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS
FOR CERTAINLY SHE TOLD HERSELF SHE WAS NOT GOING OUT TO LOOK FOR HIM
DO THE MEN WEAR CLOTHES LIKE THAT EVERY DAY IN THE STREET SHE CAUGHT EMIL BY HIS SLEEVE AND TURNED HIM ABOUT
HOW DISCOURAGED THE BOYS WILL BE WHEN THEY HEAR
THE TWO FRIENDS HAD LESS TO SAY TO EACH OTHER THAN USUAL AS IF THE COLD HAD SOMEHOW PENETRATED TO THEIR HEARTS
HE FELT CHEAP AND ILL-USED AS IF SOME ONE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF HIM
SHE SOLD CANDY AT THE FAIR
CARL NODDED TO HIM AND HURRIED UP THE DRAW PAST THE GARDEN AND INTO THE PASTURE WHERE THE MILKING COWS USED TO BE KEPT
HOW AWKWARDLY THINGS COME ABOUT IT WAS NOT VERY LONG BEFORE MARIE SPRANG UP OUT OF THE GRASS AGAIN
WE WANT TO BUY A HAMMOCK IF YOU HAVE ONE ALEXANDRA EXPLAINED AND MY LITTLE BROTHER HERE WANTS TO SEE YOUR BIG POND WHERE SO MANY BIRDS COME IVAR SMILED FOOLISHLY AND BEGAN RUBBING THE HORSES NOSES AND FEELING ABOUT THEIR MOUTHS BEHIND THE BITS
SHE HAD GIVEN HIM SOME BRANDY AND PUT HIM TO BED
IVAR HAD LIVED FOR THREE YEARS IN THE CLAY BANK WITHOUT DEFILING THE FACE OF NATURE ANY MORE THAN THE COYOTE THAT HAD LIVED THERE BEFORE HIM HAD DONE
WHEN THEY REACHED THE CHURCH A SCORE OF TEAMS WERE HITCHED IN FRONT OF THE BASEMENT DOORS THAT OPENED FROM THE HILLSIDE UPON THE SANDED TERRACE WHERE THE BOYS WRESTLED AND HAD JUMPING-MATCHES
ANYWAY I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THE RIVER FARMS I WON'T BE SATISFIED TILL I'VE SEEN FOR MYSELF LOU FIDGETED
OSCAR STOPPED THE HORSES AND WAVED TO CARL WHO CAUGHT UP HIS HAT AND RAN THROUGH THE MELON PATCH TO JOIN THEM
YOURS IS SOMETHING LIKE HIS WHEN YOU TAKE PAINS GRANDFATHER WAS REALLY CROOKED WAS HE HE MARRIED AN UNSCRUPULOUS WOMAN AND THEN--THEN I'M AFRAID HE WAS REALLY CROOKED
HE AND HIS HIRED MAN USUALLY PLAYED CALIFORNIA JACK IN THE EVENING
IT WAS ONE OF MY MISTAKES THAT I DID NOT FIND THAT OUT SOONER
ALEXANDRA FELT A GREAT TENDERNESS FOR THEM ALL
NOW I SUPPOSE YOU WANT ME TO GO AWAY AND LET YOU PLAY WITH THEM MARIE WAS GAZING IN RAPTURE AT THE SOFT BLUE COLOR OF THE STONES
HE HAD LOST TWO CHILDREN BOYS THAT CAME BETWEEN LOU AND EMIL AND THERE HAD BEEN THE COST OF SICKNESS AND DEATH
THERE ARE ONLY TWO OR THREE HUMAN STORIES AND THEY GO ON REPEATING THEMSELVES AS FIERCELY AS IF THEY HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
ALEXANDRA KNEW THAT HE WAS THINKING OF MANY THINGS
I DIDN'T NOTICE THE STORM TILL IT WAS ON ME AND I COULDN'T WALK AGAINST IT
I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT
I COULD RUN AWAY WITH YOU RIGHT NOW AND HE COULD ONLY SIT DOWN AND CRY ABOUT IT
HE HAD BEGUN TO CRY
WHILE I GO THROUGH THE BUREAU DRAWERS YOU MIGHT LOOK IN THOSE HAT-BOXES ON THE CLOSET-SHELF OVER WHERE FRANK'S CLOTHES HANG
OH I KNOW
I HAVE TO TELL HER WHEN TO EAT AND WHEN TO GO TO BED PATIENCE PATIENCE SISTER MUTTERED IVAR AS HE SETTLED THE BIT IN THE HORSE'S MOUTH
AND HE RAN LIKE A HARE BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THAT MOONLIT SPACE BEFORE HE COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND TO GO INTO THE DARK STABLE FOR A HORSE
VOUS ETES TRES SAVANTE MA FILLE HE PATTED HER YELLOW TURBAN CALLING VENEZ DONC MES GARCONS
HE GRADUATED TWO YEARS AGO THEN YOU'D HAVE TO TRY THE SENIORS WOULDN'T YOU
IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO ME SHE'S THERE STILL JUST LIKE WE SAW HER I KNOW
HE PUT HIS HAND ON HER BENT HEAD
AND NOBODY KNEW WHY
BUT I SUPPOSE THAT'S TOO MUCH TO EXPECT
YOU HADN'T OUGHT TO SAID THAT ABOUT HER AGE THOUGH OSCAR
EMIL'S FRATERNITY RATHER PRIDED ITSELF UPON ITS DANCES AND SOMETIMES HE DID HIS DUTY AND DANCED EVERY DANCE
IF HE'S BOUGHT A GUITAR HE GOES SERENADING
ISN'T IT QUEER
HIS SHAVED HEAD SHOWING THE CONFORMATION OF HIS SKULL GAVE HIM A CRIMINAL LOOK WHICH HE HAD NOT HAD DURING THE TRIAL
WHEN EVERYTHING IS DONE AND OVER FOR ONE AT TWENTY-THREE IT IS PLEASANT TO LET THE MIND WANDER FORTH AND FOLLOW A YOUNG ADVENTURER WHO HAS LIFE BEFORE HIM
THE DRY BRACING CLIMATE AND THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE LAND MAKE LABOR EASY FOR MEN AND BEASTS
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US ABOUT THE BULL-FIGHTS SHE WANTED TO WRING ALL HIS EXPERIENCES FROM HIM AT ONCE WITHOUT WAITING A MOMENT
AND THEN I MAY TAKE YOU WITH ME
THE MOMENT SHE HAD REACHED THEM IN THE ORCHARD THAT MORNING EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HER
AND IT MIGHT SO EASILY HAVE BEEN THE OTHER WAY--EMIL WHO WAS ILL AND AMEDEE WHO WAS SAD
THERE ARE TOO MANY OF MY KIND
HE HAD BUT ONE ROOM NEATLY PLASTERED AND WHITEWASHED AND THERE WAS A WOODEN FLOOR
IN SPITE OF HER USUAL AIR OF SURENESS AND SELF-POSSESSION ALEXANDRA FELT ILL AT EASE IN HOTELS AND SHE WAS GLAD WHEN SHE WENT TO THE CLERK'S DESK TO REGISTER THAT THERE WERE NOT MANY PEOPLE IN THE LOBBY
WHY CAN'T I DRIVE FOR YOU AS FAR AS OUR PLACE
SHE HAD A SERIOUS THOUGHTFUL FACE AND HER CLEAR DEEP BLUE EYES WERE FIXED INTENTLY ON THE DISTANCE WITHOUT SEEMING TO SEE ANYTHING AS IF SHE WERE IN TROUBLE
THE OLD MAN WORE HIS BUFFALO-SKIN COAT AND OCCASIONALLY STOPPED TO WARM HIS FINGERS AT THE LANTERN
HOW FINE YOU ARE HE STEPPED BACK AND LOOKED AT HER ADMIRINGLY
I'M ALMOST SORRY I LET THEM GO IT'S TURNED SO COLD
SHE AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD FRIENDS
YOU ARE BY YOURSELF HE ASKED LOOKING TOWARD THE DOORWAY INTO THE PARLOR
IT'S SPLENDID WHEN HE SAW EMIL AMEDEE WAVED TO HIM AND CALLED TO ONE OF HIS TWENTY COUSINS TO TAKE THE REINS
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN WAY OF DOING THINGS AND THEY DO NOT ALTOGETHER LIKE MY WAY I AM AFRAID
MY GARDEN ALL CUT TO PIECES LIKE SAUERKRAUT
BUT THEY ARE DIFFERENT AND NOW THAT THEY HAVE FARMS OF THEIR OWN I DO NOT SEE SO MUCH OF THEM
HE MIGHT HOWL THEY ALL LAUGHED AGAIN AND OSCAR URGED THE HORSES UP THE CRUMBLING SIDE OF A CLAY BANK
I BELIEVE THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF THE COW IN MOST SWEDISH GIRLS
CAN'T GET WELL THE GIRL'S LIP TREMBLED
SHE KNEW THAT EMIL WAS ASHAMED OF LOU AND OSCAR BECAUSE THEY WERE BIGOTED AND SELF-SATISFIED
AND YOU MUST TAKE YOUR GUITAR
OLD IVAR MET HIM AT THE WINDMILL AND TOOK HIS HORSE AND THE YOUNG MAN WENT DIRECTLY INTO THE HOUSE
THE WOMEN WERE CHECKING OVER THEIR GROCERIES AND PINNING THEIR BIG RED SHAWLS ABOUT THEIR HEADS
THOUGH HE'S GOT HIMSELF IN SUCH A TANGLE THAT FOR A LONG TIME HIS LOVE HAS BEEN BITTERER THAN HIS HATE
EVEN AS A BOY HE USED TO FEEL WHEN HE SAW HER COMING WITH HER FREE STEP HER UPRIGHT HEAD AND CALM SHOULDERS THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE HAD WALKED STRAIGHT OUT OF THE MORNING ITSELF
LET'S HITCH UP AND GET OUT OF HERE
NO ONE HAS EVER FOUND OUT WHAT HIS TEMPTATIONS ARE
YOU OUGHT TO DO AS YOU PLEASE
SPRING SUMMER AUTUMN WINTER SPRING
THEY WERE GROWN MEN NOW AND AS ALEXANDRA SAID FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS THEY HAD BEEN GROWING MORE AND MORE LIKE THEMSELVES
HE HAS A LOT OF HANDS BUT HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT KNOWS HOW TO DRIVE THE HEADER OR HOW TO RUN THE ENGINE SO HE HAS TO BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE
BUT SHE HAD NEVER HUMBLED HERSELF
I FORGET ENGLISH
HE FELT THAT IT MADE THEM CONSPICUOUS AND GAVE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT THEM
YOU WON'T HARDLY KNOW IT
POOR FRANK
AT YOUR AGE TOO
I KEPT THEM FOR A LONG WHILE
WHEN SHE FIRST CAME TO HIM HER FAITH IN HIM HER ADORATION--FRANK STRUCK THE MARE WITH HIS FIST
PUSH THAT WHITE BUTTON WHEN YOU'RE THROUGH WITH HIM AND I'LL COME THE GUARD WENT OUT AND ALEXANDRA AND FRANK WERE LEFT ALONE
IVAR
OH I HAD BEGUN TO THINK YOU WERE NOT COMING AT ALL MAYBE
AFTER SUPPER LOU PUT ON A NECKTIE AND WENT ACROSS THE FIELDS TO COURT ANNIE LEE AND CARL AND OSCAR SAT DOWN TO A GAME OF CHECKERS WHILE ALEXANDRA READ THE SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON ALOUD TO HER MOTHER AND EMIL
HE HAD PLAYED AND WRESTLED AND SUNG AND COURTED UNDER ITS SHADOW
IT'S EXCITING TO SEE EVERYTHING GROWING SO FAST,--AND TO GET THE GRASS CUT
EVEN LOU AND OSCAR WEREN'T WHEN THEY WERE BOYS EMIL LOOKED INCREDULOUS BUT HE DID NOT DISPUTE THE POINT
THE GIRLS WOULD AS SOON EXPECT ME TO CHASE THEM WITH AN AXE LOU FLUSHED AND SIGNALED TO HIS WIFE
HOW COULD YOU EVER COME AWAY AT THAT INSTANT AMEDEE LAID HANDS ON THE SWITCHBOARD
THEN CAME THE HARD TIMES THAT BROUGHT EVERY ONE ON THE DIVIDE TO THE BRINK OF DESPAIR
FRANK STRAINED HIS EARS
IN ELEVEN LONG YEARS JOHN BERGSON HAD MADE BUT LITTLE IMPRESSION UPON THE WILD LAND HE HAD COME TO TAME
IT HAD ITS LITTLE JOKE
THERE'S NO GETTING BEHIND THAT CONCEITED SWEDISH GRIN
SHE LOOKED LIKE SOME QUEER FOREIGN KIND OF A DOLL
DOTTER HE CALLED FEEBLY DOTTER HE HEARD HER QUICK STEP AND SAW HER TALL FIGURE APPEAR IN THE DOORWAY WITH THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND HER
FAINTER FAINTER
WELL THEN TELL ME PLEASE TELL ME WHY YOU RAN AWAY WITH FRANK SHABATA MARIE DREW BACK
SHE WENT AWAY ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK
WHEN YOU DRIVE ABOUT OVER THE COUNTRY YOU CAN FEEL IT COMING OSCAR HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS HEAD LOWERED HIS HANDS HANGING BETWEEN HIS KNEES
HE MUST HAVE SEEN HARDER TIMES THAN THIS HERE
SOME SUCH FEELING AS HAD TWICE FROZEN FRANK SHABATA'S FEATURES WHILE THEY TALKED TOGETHER
INDEED HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HER AS BEING A WOMAN AT ALL ONLY A SISTER
HE TURNED ON HIS BACK AND LAY STILL FOR A LONG TIME HIS HANDS LOCKED UNDER HIS HEAD LOOKING UP AT THE CEILING
FORTUNATE COUNTRY THAT IS ONE DAY TO RECEIVE HEARTS LIKE ALEXANDRA'S INTO ITS BOSOM TO GIVE THEM OUT AGAIN IN THE YELLOW WHEAT IN THE RUSTLING CORN IN THE SHINING EYES OF YOUTH
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY TURNED THE CORNERS WHERE THEY DIVIDED THREE AND THREE AND THEN SWUNG ROUND INTO LINE AGAIN WITH A MOVEMENT THAT LOOKED AS COMPLICATED AS A WHEEL OF ARTILLERY
I NEVER SEE LOU'S SCYTHE OVER HERE MARIE CLUCKED TO HER HORSE
LIKE AS NOT THEY WILL BE WANTING TO TAKE ME TO HASTINGS BECAUSE I HAVE BUILT A SILO
BEFORE SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING SHE HAD COMMITTED HERSELF TO THAT KISS THAT WAS AT ONCE A BOY'S AND A MAN'S AS TIMID AS IT WAS TENDER
THE ROADS WERE BUT FAINT TRACKS IN THE GRASS AND THE FIELDS WERE SCARCELY NOTICEABLE
AND AT LAST SHE RAN OUT ON THE ROOF OF THE OLD DUGOUT AND HER LEGS WENT THROUGH AND THERE SHE STUCK BELLOWING
BUT THAT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS
WHY DO WE ALL HAVE TO BE PUNISHED
WE WILL SELL THE PLACE FOR WHATEVER WE CAN GET AND AUCTION THE STOCK
SHE TURNED THEM OVER AND LOOKED AT THE FOREIGN STAMPS AND THEN SAT WATCHING THE FLYING SNOW WHILE THE DUSK DEEPENED IN THE KITCHEN AND THE STOVE SENT OUT A RED GLOW
THOUGH THE LATTER THEY HAD TO CONJECTURE FOR EMIL AVOIDED TALKING TO THEM ABOUT ANY BUT FAMILY MATTERS
CARL WHO COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IVAR SAID SAW THAT THE TWO BOYS WERE DISPLEASED
AFTER DINNER FRANK AND OLD MOISE RETIRED TO THE REAR ROOM OF THE SALOON TO PLAY CALIFORNIA JACK AND DRINK THEIR COGNAC AND EMIL WENT OVER TO THE BANKER'S WITH RAOUL WHO HAD BEEN ASKED TO SING FOR THE BISHOP
WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO HER ABOUT IT
WE ALL KNOW THAT IVAR'S PERFECTLY HARMLESS
EMIL STOPPED AT FIVE-FEET-FIVE DECLARING THAT HE WOULD SPOIL HIS APPETITE FOR SUPPER IF HE JUMPED ANY MORE
THERE'S NOTHING IN IT FOR US DOWN THERE EMIL
WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE CAN BE IVAR THE OLD MAN LIFTED A SET OF SINGLE HARNESS CAREFULLY FROM ITS PEG
THERE'S MRS LEE WITHOUT ANY COFFEE LATER WHEN MRS LEE DECLARED THAT HER POWERS WERE SPENT MARIE AND ALEXANDRA WENT UPSTAIRS TO LOOK FOR SOME CROCHET PATTERNS THE OLD LADY WANTED TO BORROW
THEY SAY THAT YOUR BROTHERS ARE AFRAID--GOD FORBID!--THAT I MAY DO YOU SOME INJURY WHEN MY SPELLS ARE ON ME
FOR WEEKS JOHN BERGSON HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS
BE QUICK
I DON'T SEE WHY THE BOYS ARE ALWAYS TAKING ON ABOUT GOING AWAY SHE SAID WIPING HER EYES
AS ANGELIQUE FLUSHED AND EXCITED WITH FLOUR ON HER HANDS STOPPED TO SMILE AT THE BABY EMIL BERGSON RODE UP TO THE KITCHEN DOOR ON HIS MARE AND DISMOUNTED
SHE HAD DARK RED CHEEKS LIKE THIS WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL MRS LEE
I WOULDN'T HAVE IF I HADN'T WANTED TO SEE YOU VERY VERY MUCH ALEXANDRA LOOKED AT HIM WITH HER CALM DELIBERATE EYES
IT MADE HER VERY NERVOUS TO HEAR HIM AND NOT TO SEE HIM
A MIST OF FINE SNOWFLAKES WAS CURLING AND EDDYING ABOUT THE CLUSTER OF LOW DRAB BUILDINGS HUDDLED ON THE GRAY PRAIRIE UNDER A GRAY SKY
ALEXANDRA LOOKED AT HIM TIMIDLY BUT HE DID NOT ONCE RAISE HIS EYES
YES FRANK SHE SAID KINDLY
AT LAST ON THE SIXTH DAY ALEXANDRA TURNED BRIGHAM'S HEAD NORTHWARD AND LEFT THE RIVER BEHIND
THAT RED BUILDING RIGHT THERE HE POINTED
WHY DON'T YOU GO OVER THERE SOME AFTERNOON AND HOG-TIGHT HER FENCES
A RECUMBENT FIGURE STARTED UP FROM THE GRASS AND CAME RUNNING TOWARD THEM THROUGH THE FLICKERING SCREEN OF LIGHT AND SHADE
HE AND ALEXANDRA LED THE WAY TO THE PORCH
YOU HURT ME EACH OF JOE'S FRIENDS GAVE HER A BAG OF CANDY AND SHE KISSED THEM ALL AROUND THOUGH SHE DID NOT LIKE COUNTRY CANDY VERY WELL
WHEN SHE CAME BACK HE WAS FAST ASLEEP
HIS FACE IS THIN AND SHREWD AND WRINKLED ABOUT THE EYES WHILE OSCAR'S IS THICK AND DULL
AND THE FEET AS I UNDERSTAND IT ARE FREE MEMBERS
HOGS DO NOT LIKE TO BE FILTHY THE BOYS OUTSIDE THE DOOR HAD BEEN LISTENING
NO GRAPES ON THE CREEK NO NOTHING
SHE RAN DOWNSTAIRS AND HURRIED OUT TO MEET HIM TO HIDE HIS INFIRMITY FROM THE EYES OF HER HOUSEHOLD
WE COME AND GO BUT THE LAND IS ALWAYS HERE
THEY MADE A PRETTY PICTURE IN THE STRONG SUNLIGHT THE LEAFY PATTERN SURROUNDING THEM LIKE A NET
AND I AM NO BETTER THAN THE REST
I WISH I COULD GET MORE
I HOPE HE CAN RENT IT TO THE NEIGHBORS IT COST SO MUCH
I THOUGHT SO CARL THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR AND PUSHED THE DARK LOCK BACK FROM HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS WHITE NERVOUS HAND
WE OUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN THINGS IN OUR OWN HANDS YEARS AGO
BUT BEFORE I GET A BATHTUB I'M GOING TO GET A PIANO FOR MILLY OSCAR AT THE END OF THE TABLE LOOKED UP FROM HIS PLATE
SOMETIMES HE COULD HAVE THANKED THE MAN WHO WOULD BRING HIM EVIDENCE AGAINST HIS WIFE
TYST
IF EMIL WERE ONCE AWAY AND SETTLED AT WORK SHE WOULD NOT HAVE THE FEELING THAT SHE WAS SPOILING HIS LIFE
DID YOU LEAVE IT IN THE STORE
SHE KNEW HE WAS LIKE A CRAZY MAN WHEN HE WAS ANGRY
AFTER I GOT AWAY IT WAS ALL TOO DELICATE TOO INTANGIBLE TO WRITE ABOUT ALEXANDRA LOOKED AT HIM MOURNFULLY
SOME OF AMEDEE'S COUSINS WERE THERE DRESSED IN BLACK AND WEEPING
I THINK HE IS TRYING TO COUNT UP WHAT HE IS LEAVING FOR US
SHE TRIED TO BE PATIENT WITH HER HUSBAND
THEY WERE MOVING SOFTLY KEEPING CLOSE TOGETHER AND CARL KNEW THAT THEY EXPECTED TO FIND DUCKS ON THE POND
MARIE STARTED UP,--DIRECTLY INTO EMIL'S ARMS
ALL THE TIME I WAS A BOY WE HAD A MORTGAGE HANGING OVER US THEN DON'T SIGN ONE
WHEN SHE WAS EIGHTEEN SHE RAN AWAY FROM THE CONVENT SCHOOL AND GOT MARRIED CRAZY CHILD
IF WE GO ON WITH THIS TALK IT WILL ONLY MAKE HARD FEELING LOU WHIPPED ABOUT FROM THE WINDOW
DID LOU AND OSCAR GO TO THE BLUE TO CUT WOOD TO-DAY CARL ASKED
BUT I'M HEAVY AND NUMB
THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN SEEMED TO GET EVERY OUNCE THERE WAS IN HIM BEHIND THE BALL AS IT LEFT HIS HAND
I COULDN'T GO THROUGH THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT STOPPING OFF TO HAVE A LOOK AT YOU
I KNOW THAT I AM GOING AWAY ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
LET ME SEE--AH IT'S YOUR MOTHER THAT SHE LOOKS LIKE ALEXANDRA
A WAVE OF ZEAL AND FIERY ENTHUSIASM SWEPT OVER THEM
HE MOUNTED HIS MARE AND RODE ON TO SAINTE-AGNES TO BID HIS FRIENDS THERE GOOD-BYE
I CRIED FOR YOU AT NIGHT
HE CHARACTERIZED FRANK SHABATA BY A BOHEMIAN EXPRESSION WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF STUFFED SHIRT
IF HE COULD ONCE HAVE MADE MARIE THOROUGHLY UNHAPPY HE MIGHT HAVE RELENTED AND RAISED HER FROM THE DUST
EMIL STROKED THE BLACK FUZZ ON BAPTISTE'S HEAD
HE HAD A PECULIAR RELIGION OF HIS OWN AND COULD NOT GET ON WITH ANY OF THE DENOMINATIONS
FRANK THIS IS MR LINSTRUM FRANK TOOK OFF HIS BROAD STRAW HAT AND NODDED TO ALEXANDRA
CONDITIONS WERE HARD
LONG FINGERS OF LIGHT REACHED THROUGH THE APPLE BRANCHES AS THROUGH A NET
EVERYTHING JUST FINE
THE NEW COMMUNICANTS WITH THEIR CLEAR REVERENT FACES WERE BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK UPON AS THEY ENTERED IN A BODY AND TOOK THE FRONT BENCHES RESERVED FOR THEM
I EVEN TRY TO GET ALONG WITH FRANK ON HER ACCOUNT IS FRANK HER HUSBAND YES
SHE WAS BARELY SIXTEEN AND WAS IN THE GRADUATING CLASS OF THE OMAHA HIGH SCHOOL WHEN FRANK SHABATA ARRIVED FROM THE OLD COUNTRY AND SET ALL THE BOHEMIAN GIRLS IN A FLUTTER
FOR YEARS AFTER THAT I WAS ALWAYS SQUEEZING AND BORROWING UNTIL I WAS ASHAMED TO SHOW MY FACE IN THE BANKS
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE I'M GETTING TIRED OF STANDING UP FOR THIS COUNTRY I WON'T TELL THE BOYS YET IF YOU'D RATHER NOT OH I'LL TELL THEM MYSELF TO-NIGHT WHEN THEY COME HOME
THOUGH HE TOOK UP HIS GUN WITH DARK PROJECTS IN HIS MIND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PARALYZED WITH FRIGHT HAD HE KNOWN THAT THERE WAS THE SLIGHTEST PROBABILITY OF HIS EVER CARRYING ANY OF THEM OUT
BUT FOR MARIE SHABATA IT HAD NOT BEEN SO EASY
LATE ONE JUNE AFTERNOON ALEXANDRA BERGSON WAS DRIVING ALONG ONE OF THE MANY ROADS THAT LED THROUGH THE RICH FRENCH FARMING COUNTRY TO THE BIG CHURCH
MARIE LOOKED ABOUT THE DUSKY SITTING-ROOM
THE ONLY DIFFICULTY WAS THE CANDLE IN MARIE'S TENT
NOW THEY CARRIED EMIL OFF TO SHOW HIM THE CLUB ROOM THEY HAD JUST FITTED UP OVER THE POST-OFFICE DOWN IN THE VILLAGE
SHE MIGHT BE AT MRS HILLER'S OR WITH ALEXANDRA
GIVE ME A YEAR AS YOU WILL SAID ALEXANDRA WEARILY
BUT THEY DID NOT
RAISE EVERY DOLLAR WE CAN AND BUY EVERY ACRE WE CAN MORTGAGE THE HOMESTEAD AGAIN LOU CRIED
CARL GAVE A LITTLE CHUCKLE AS HE OPENED THE SHABATAS GATE FOR HER
AND IT DID NOT OCCUR TO EMIL THAT ANY ONE HAD EVER REASONED THUS BEFORE THAT MUSIC HAD EVER BEFORE GIVEN A MAN THIS EQUIVOCAL REVELATION
I WON'T SAY ANY MORE ABOUT IT IF YOU'D RATHER NOT
LOU FOLLOWED HIM
ALEXANDRA TOOK UP HER SEWING AGAIN
BARELY SALUTING THE CALLERS HE TURNED AT ONCE TO HIS WIFE AND BEGAN IN AN OUTRAGED TONE I HAVE TO LEAVE MY TEAM TO DRIVE THE OLD WOMAN HILLER'S HOGS OUT-A MY WHEAT
SHE MEANT TO TELL ALEXANDRA EVERYTHING AS SOON AS EMIL WENT AWAY
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER WAS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE SO LONG AS SHE DID NOT DRAG OTHER PEOPLE DOWN WITH HER
YOU MIGHT HAVE KNOWN FRANK WOULDN'T BUY IT FOR ME AND I WANTED IT AWFULLY EMIL LAUGHED SHORTLY
IT WAS A BUSY SEASON ON THE FARM WITH THE CORN-PLOWING GOING ON AND EVEN EMIL WAS IN THE FIELD WITH A TEAM AND CULTIVATOR
BUT HE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD IT AGAIN IF HE COULD NOT HE
ONE HE BROUGHT FROM THE OLD COUNTRY
MARIE WAS LYING ON HER SIDE UNDER THE WHITE MULBERRY TREE HER FACE HALF HIDDEN IN THE GRASS HER EYES CLOSED HER HANDS LYING LIMPLY WHERE THEY HAD HAPPENED TO FALL
HE BELIEVED IN THE LAND AND IN YOU I GUESS EMIL SAID TO HIMSELF
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY CHANCES
EMIL ONCE AWAY SHE COULD LET EVERYTHING ELSE GO AND LIVE A NEW LIFE OF PERFECT LOVE
AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDRA'S CART DROVE UP TO THE SHABATAS GATE AND MARIE SAW MRS LEE'S RED SHAWL COME BOBBING UP THE PATH
TO-NIGHT WHEN SHE MET HIS STEADY POWERFUL EYES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO FEEL THE SWEETNESS OF THE DREAM HE WAS DREAMING
I AIN'T HAD NOT'ING AG'IN DAT BOY
I'M COWARDLY ABOUT THINGS THAT REMIND ME OF MYSELF
I'LL HAVE TO GO BACK IN THE SPRING
LOU REACHED FOR A POTATO
THE TEEMING LIFE THAT GOES ON DOWN IN THE LONG GRASS IS EXTERMINATED
IVAR SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND TUCKED HIS FEET UNDER HIM
THINK SO
WE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OUR FATHERS HAD GIVEN US FOR CANDY AND I BOUGHT TWO PECKS AND CARL BOUGHT ONE
SHE COULD ALWAYS FIND OUT MORE ABOUT ALEXANDRA'S DOMESTIC ECONOMY FROM THE PRATTLING MAIDS THAN FROM ALEXANDRA HERSELF AND WHAT SHE DISCOVERED SHE USED TO HER OWN ADVANTAGE WITH LOU
ALEXANDRA TALKED TO THE MEN ABOUT THEIR CROPS AND TO THE WOMEN ABOUT THEIR POULTRY
SHE TICKLED HIM TOO
AND IF HE KNEW WE WOULDN'T GET ANYTHING OUT OF HIM NOT EVEN A HAMMOCK
THERE'S NOTHING TO GET UPSET ABOUT
POOR FRANK DOES EVEN NOW I THINK
MARIE COULD HEAR HIM TALKING AND STRUMMING ON HIS GUITAR WHILE RAOUL MARCEL SANG FALSETTO
I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN BEFORE YOU LEFT HOME
THEY WERE MORE TO BLAME THAN YOU FRANK JERKED A DIRTY BLUE HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS TROUSERS POCKET
THAT WILL GIVE US UPWARDS OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED ACRES WON'T IT
LISTEN HERE WHAT HE DO WIT HIS MONEY AND FRANK BEGAN THE CATALOGUE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S REPUTED EXTRAVAGANCES
I'LL NEVER GIVE THE GOVERNOR ANY PEACE
HE WOULD TURN IT ALL DAY WITHOUT HURRYING WITHOUT SLOWING DOWN
ALEXANDRA HERSELF HAS CHANGED VERY LITTLE
I AM TOO LITTLE TO FACE THE CRITICISM OF EVEN SUCH MEN AS LOU AND OSCAR
OSCAR COULD NOT GROW A MUSTACHE
ALL THE GIRLS AROUND HERE HAVE BEEN TAKING LESSONS FOR YEARS BUT MILLY IS THE ONLY ONE OF THEM WHO CAN EVER PLAY ANYTHING WHEN YOU ASK HER
I HAVE BEEN VERY LONELY CARL THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE TOGETHER LEAVING THE DIVIDE BEHIND THEM UNDER THE EVENING STAR
YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO SUCH A THING IVAR LIFTED HIS SHAGGY HEAD AND LOOKED AT HER OUT OF HIS LITTLE EYES
I WISH I'D BROUGHT MY GUN ANYWAY ALEXANDRA HE SAID FRETFULLY
YOU DO NOT FEEL HARD TO ME FRANK SHE ASKED AT LAST
YOU'RE AS BAD AS IVAR
SEE THERE GOES THE SUN CARL
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AT THE TALL YOUTH
I'M AFRAID I DO SET PEOPLE AGAINST HIM AS HE SAYS
WHEN ANYTHING COMES UP HE ALWAYS SAYS I WONDER WHAT THE BERGSONS ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT
BETWEEN THE RAIN AND THE DARKNESS IVAR COULD SEE VERY LITTLE SO HE LET EMIL'S MARE HAVE THE REIN KEEPING HER HEAD IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
WE NOT TALK HERE EXCEPT SWEAR ALEXANDRA WAS BEWILDERED
WHY HAD SHE EVER RUN AWAY WITH FRANK SHABATA AND HOW COULD SHE GO ON LAUGHING AND WORKING AND TAKING AN INTEREST IN THINGS
ONE SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON ALEXANDRA HAD GONE OVER TO THE GARDEN ACROSS THE DRAW TO DIG SWEET POTATOES--THEY HAD BEEN THRIVING UPON THE WEATHER THAT WAS FATAL TO EVERYTHING ELSE
HE HAD SETTLED IN THE ROUGH COUNTRY ACROSS THE COUNTY LINE WHERE NO ONE LIVED BUT SOME RUSSIANS,--HALF A DOZEN FAMILIES WHO DWELT TOGETHER IN ONE LONG HOUSE DIVIDED OFF LIKE BARRACKS
WHY ARE YOU DISSATISFIED WITH YOURSELF HER VISITOR WINCED
AND YET I SOMETIMES ENVY THEM
NO I'M NOT
POOH
AFTER IT HAD PASSED HE RODE ON AGAIN BUT HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING EXCEPT HIS PHYSICAL WEAKNESS AND HIS DESIRE TO BE COMFORTED BY HIS WIFE
MARIE RAN FORWARD AND TAKING HIM BY THE ARM GAVE HIM A LITTLE PUSH TOWARD HER GUESTS
YOU CAN TELL JUST HOW THEY FELT WHEN THEY FLEW UP
I'LL NEVER DO IT
STICK TO THE FACTS
SHE NOTICED THAT IT IMPROVED HIS MANNERS
HIS LIFE POURED ITSELF OUT ALONG THE ROAD BEFORE HIM AS HE RODE TO THE SHABATA FARM
I TRUST HIM WITH EVERYTHING
IT IS FOR THE INDULGENCE OF THE BODY
SAN--CTA MARI-I-I-A WAILED RAOUL FROM THE ORGAN LOFT
LOOK LOOK EMIL THERE'S IVAR'S BIG POND ALEXANDRA POINTED TO A SHINING SHEET OF WATER THAT LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF A SHALLOW DRAW
HE WAS PACKING WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM
WHEN THE SUPPER BELL RANG AND THE BOYS CAME TROOPING IN TO GET SEATS AT THE FIRST TABLE SHE FORGOT ALL ABOUT HER ANNOYANCE AND RAN TO GREET THE TALLEST OF THE CROWD IN HIS CONSPICUOUS ATTIRE
UNDER HER YELLOW TURBAN THE RED CORAL PENDANTS SWUNG AGAINST WHITE CHEEKS
HE WAS MUCH LARGER AND STRONGER AND SWIFTER AND HE CARRIED HER AS EASILY AS IF SHE WERE A SHEAF OF WHEAT
HIS SHARP SHOULDERS STOOPED AS IF HE WERE VERY TIRED HIS FACE WAS PALE AND THERE WERE BLUISH SHADOWS UNDER HIS DARK EYES
YOU'VE SEEN YOURSELF FOR SO LONG IN THE DULL MINDS OF THE PEOPLE ABOUT YOU THAT IF I WERE TO TELL YOU HOW YOU SEEM TO ME IT WOULD STARTLE YOU
YOU OUGHT TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
DO STOP ON YOUR WAY HOME AND SHOW IT TO MRS HILLER
THAT WAS HOW SHE MADE YOU FEEL SO JOLLY
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE BRIGHT SPOT OF WATER HE HEARD A WHIRR OF WINGS AND THE DUCKS SHOT UP INTO THE AIR
OSCAR AND ME HAVE ALWAYS BEEN EASY-GOING AND WE'VE NEVER MADE ANY FUSS
ALEXANDRA LOOKED AT HIM
WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE MY BOY BECAUSE HE WAS THE BEST THERE WAS I SUPPOSE
THE HOUSES ON THE DIVIDE WERE SMALL AND WERE USUALLY TUCKED AWAY IN LOW PLACES
SHE DID NOT NOTICE THE LITTLE BOY UNTIL HE PULLED HER BY THE COAT
AMEDEE WAS IN A VERY BAD WAY
BUT FRANK SHE HAS ONLY HER LAME BOY TO HELP HER
ONE BALL HAD TORN THROUGH HER RIGHT LUNG ANOTHER HAD SHATTERED THE CAROTID ARTERY
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS MARIE
SHE ALWAYS LOVED TO WATCH THEM TO THINK OF THEIR VASTNESS AND DISTANCE AND OF THEIR ORDERED MARCH
HE SPRANG UP AND BEGAN TO WIND THE CLOCK FURIOUSLY
THIS WAS SAID TO FORTIFY ONE EFFECTUALLY AGAINST THE COLD AND THEY SMACKED THEIR LIPS AFTER EACH PULL AT THE FLASK
LOU WANTS TO GET MARRIED POOR BOY AND HE CAN'T UNTIL TIMES ARE BETTER
THEN HE SAYS HIS PRAYERS AT GREAT LENGTH BEHIND THE STOVE PUTS ON HIS BUFFALO-SKIN COAT AND GOES OUT TO HIS ROOM IN THE BARN
WHOSE BUSINESS IS IT BUT MY OWN DON'T YOU KNOW HE'D GET HOLD OF YOUR PROPERTY HE'D GET HOLD OF WHAT I WISHED TO GIVE HIM CERTAINLY OSCAR SAT UP SUDDENLY AND LOU CLUTCHED AT HIS BRISTLY HAIR
THERE WAS A LITTLE ROUND PHOTOGRAPH FOR HER WATCH-CASE PHOTOGRAPHS FOR HER WALL AND DRESSER AND EVEN LONG NARROW ONES TO BE USED AS BOOKMARKS
MOST OF THEM WERE BUILT OF THE SOD ITSELF AND WERE ONLY THE UNESCAPABLE GROUND IN ANOTHER FORM
FRANK HAD GIVEN HIMSELF UP TO THE POLICE IN OMAHA AND PLEADED GUILTY OF KILLING WITHOUT MALICE AND WITHOUT PREMEDITATION
ONCE WHEN MY UNCLE LEFT ME AT THE STORE YOU DREW A LOT OF LITTLE BIRDS AND FLOWERS FOR ME ON A PIECE OF WRAPPING-PAPER
FROM THE LOG HOUSE ON THE LITTLE RISE ACROSS THE DRAW THE SMOKE WAS CURLING
YOU REMEMBER THOSE YELLOW SPARKS IN HER EYES ALEXANDRA SIGHED
BUT IT GRATIFIED HIM TO FEEL LIKE A DESPERATE MAN
AT SIX O'CLOCK ON SUNDAY MORNING THE BOYS MET AT THE CHURCH
DON'T LET ME DISTURB YOU EMIL
HE WAS ONLY FORTY-SIX AND HAD OF COURSE COUNTED UPON MORE TIME
THEY COULDN'T MEET ANY MORE
NOW FOR A DUCKING MY GIRL HE SAID TO THE MARE GATHERING UP THE REINS
JUST WAIT TILL I FINISH OFF THE KOURDNAS BY THE WAY THEY WERE BOHEMIANS
OF COURSE THE HORSES WILL TAKE YOU HOME BUT I THINK I'D BETTER LIGHT YOUR LANTERN IN CASE YOU SHOULD NEED IT HE GAVE HER THE REINS AND CLIMBED BACK INTO THE WAGON-BOX WHERE HE CROUCHED DOWN AND MADE A TENT OF HIS OVERCOAT
BUT I HAVE NEEDED YOU FOR A GREAT MANY YEARS
YOUR FARM TOOK HER FANCY AND I WAS GLAD TO HAVE HER SO NEAR ME
BUT SHE LIKED TO RUN THINGS AND WE HUMORED HER
DO I GIVE MYSELF AWAY SO QUICKLY
AND USUALLY IT'S EXACTLY THE SORT YOU ARE NOT
OH HE WILL BE HERE MARIE
SUPPOSING THAT IT WAS HIS SISTER COMING BACK FROM ONE OF HER FARMS HE KEPT ON WITH HIS WORK
IT'S CHILLY ALREADY THE MOMENT THE LIGHT GOES ALEXANDRA ROSE AND LOOKED ABOUT
THAT'S A GOOD GIRL
HOW MANY TIMES WE WILL WALK IT AGAIN
SOMETHING'S THE MATTER WITH MY INSIDES FOR SURE EMIL FELT HIS FIERY CHEEK
EVEN IN AGE MY TEMPTATIONS ARE PROLONGED
EMIL STOPPED AND HELPED THEM PUT THE BOY TO BED
YOU ALWAYS SIDE WITH THEM AGAINST ME
YOU LOOK TIRED SHE PLACED HER HAND ON MARIE'S ARM AND FELT HER SHIVER
IT WOKE UP OUT OF ITS SLEEP AND STRETCHED ITSELF AND IT WAS SO BIG SO RICH THAT WE SUDDENLY FOUND WE WERE RICH JUST FROM SITTING STILL
THEY SAY IT'S THE BIGGEST IN ALL THE COUNTRY
I DON'T DARE TO THINK ABOUT IT
THAT MAN PERCY ADAMS NORTH OF TOWN TOLD ME THAT HE WAS GOING TO LET FULLER TAKE HIS LAND AND STUFF FOR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AND A TICKET TO CHICAGO THERE'S FULLER AGAIN ALEXANDRA EXCLAIMED
SHE HAS BEEN A GOOD MOTHER TO YOU AND SHE HAS ALWAYS MISSED THE OLD COUNTRY WHEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE KITCHEN THE BOYS SAT DOWN SILENTLY AT THE TABLE
SHE LOOKED ARCHLY INTO THE BIG BROWN MUSTACHED FACES SMELLING OF SPIRITS AND TOBACCO THEN SHE RAN HER TINY FOREFINGER DELICATELY OVER JOE'S BRISTLY CHIN AND SAID HERE IS MY SWEETHEART THE BOHEMIANS ROARED WITH LAUGHTER AND MARIE'S UNCLE HUGGED HER UNTIL SHE CRIED PLEASE DON'T UNCLE JOE
SOMEHOW ALEXANDRA HAD IRRITATED HER OF LATE
MORGAN HIMSELF COULDN'T TOUCH YOU
FRANK HAD ON THE WHOLE DONE BETTER THAN ONE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED
SHE HAD MORE THAN ONCE TAKEN THAT GUN AWAY FROM HIM AND HELD IT WHEN HE WAS ANGRY WITH OTHER PEOPLE
HE KEPT A CALENDAR AND EVERY MORNING HE CHECKED OFF A DAY SO THAT HE WAS NEVER IN ANY DOUBT AS TO WHICH DAY OF THE WEEK IT WAS
BUT SURELY IT DID DO THAT IF NOTHING ELSE LOU'S THIN FACE REDDENED UP TO THE ROOTS OF HIS BRISTLY HAIR
WELL MILLY MUST HAVE GOT ON PRETTY GOOD IF SHE'S GOT PAST THE ORGAN
WHICH WAY TO TURN
EVEN FRANK HAD HIS CHURLISH DELICACIES
BUT I DO HERE ALEXANDRA TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND LOOKED OFF INTO THE RED WEST
HIS LOVE OF ROUTINE AMOUNTED TO A VICE
YOU'RE PITCHING BETTER THAN YOU DID IN THE SPRING AMEDEE GRINNED
SHE WAS TEARING ALL OVER THE PLACE KNOCKING HERSELF AGAINST THINGS
PART IV
ALL THE AUNTS AND GRANDMOTHERS WEPT WITH JOY
YOU KNOW I DON'T GO AWAY FROM HOME OFTEN AND I CAME UP HERE ON PURPOSE TO TELL YOU THIS THE WARDEN AT THE GLASS DOOR LOOKED IN INQUIRINGLY
IN SHORT HE WAS MORE SELF-CONSCIOUS THAN A MAN OF THIRTY-FIVE IS EXPECTED TO BE
YES I STILL FEEL THAT WAY THOUGH EMIL IS GONE
SHE'S AN ESPECIAL FAVORITE OF HIS
HE HAD SEEN MARIE IN THE CROWD THAT AFTERNOON
SHE WAS VEXED WITH HIM FOR STAYING OUT THERE
I WAS AFRAID HE MIGHT BE QUARRELSOME AND GET HIMSELF INTO MORE TROUBLE
I NEEDED YOU TERRIBLY WHEN IT HAPPENED CARL
II SIGNA'S WEDDING SUPPER WAS OVER
THEY ARE AFRAID I AM GOING TO MARRY HIM AND THAT SOME OF MY PROPERTY WILL GET AWAY FROM THEM EMIL SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AMEDEE WAS TO GO UP TO THE SWITCHBOARD IN THE VESTIBULE AND TURN OFF THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS AND EVERY BOY WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO KISS HIS SWEETHEART BEFORE FATHER DUCHESNE COULD FIND HIS WAY UP THE STAIRS TO TURN THE CURRENT ON AGAIN
ALL THE SHOPS IN SAINTE-AGNES WERE CLOSED AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT SO THAT THE MERCHANTS AND THEIR CLERKS COULD ATTEND THE FAIR
THE STRANGER CAME UP TO THE GATE AND STOOD HOLDING HIS HAT IN HIS HAND SMILING WHILE ALEXANDRA ADVANCED SLOWLY TO MEET HIM
MAYBE THEY ARE JUST AS DISCONTENTED DOWN THERE AS WE ARE UP HERE
HE SCRATCHED IN THE SOFT EARTH BESIDE HIM WITH A STICK
SHE SEEMED TO FEEL THE WEIGHT OF ALL THE SNOW THAT LAY DOWN THERE
WHY DON'T HE GO TO WORK LIKE THE REST OF US DID
I WALKED UP TO THE PASTURE CORNERS THIS MORNING
THE FEELING WENT OUT OF HIS FACE AND EYES
AND IN TWO DAYS THEY COULD USE HER MILK AGAIN THE ROAD TO IVAR'S HOMESTEAD WAS A VERY POOR ONE
IVAR SHE SAID SUDDENLY BEGINNING TO TRACE THE PATTERN ON THE OILCLOTH WITH HER FOREFINGER I CAME TO-DAY MORE BECAUSE I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU THAN BECAUSE I WANTED TO BUY A HAMMOCK YES THE OLD MAN SCRAPED HIS BARE FEET ON THE PLANK FLOOR
AMEDEE'S WAS THE ONLY EMPTY PEW AND HE SAT DOWN IN IT
HE PUT OUT HIS FINGER AND ABSENTLY TOUCHED A BUTTON ON HER BLACK JACKET
YES ALEXANDRA KNEW WHAT THERE WAS TO BE KNOWN ABOUT AMEDEE
HE TURNED TO HIS FARM-HAND WHO WAS READING THE OTHER HALF OF THE PAPER
YOU MUST REMEMBER HER LITTLE MARIE TOVESKY FROM OMAHA WHO USED TO VISIT HERE
THEIR VOLUBILITY DROWNED EVERY OTHER NOISE IN THE PLACE AND THE OVERHEATED STORE SOUNDED OF THEIR SPIRITED LANGUAGE AS IT REEKED OF PIPE SMOKE DAMP WOOLENS AND KEROSENE
ARE YOU AN OLD STUDENT HERE MAY I ASK NO MA'AM
YEARS AFTERWARD SHE THOUGHT OF THE DUCK AS STILL THERE SWIMMING AND DIVING ALL BY HERSELF IN THE SUNLIGHT A KIND OF ENCHANTED BIRD THAT DID NOT KNOW AGE OR CHANGE
WHEN HE REACHED THE GROUND HE HANDED THE CAT TO HER TEARFUL LITTLE MASTER
OLD IVAR WAS HITCHING THE HORSES TO THE WAGON TO TAKE THE WEDDING PRESENTS AND THE BRIDE AND GROOM UP TO THEIR NEW HOME ON ALEXANDRA'S NORTH QUARTER
OH NOW ALEXANDRA YOU ALWAYS TOOK IT PRETTY EASY
GOD HAVE MERCY UPON US PART V
SHE CAN MAKE SOME USE OF THAT AND PLAY IN CHURCH ANNIE LOOKED FLUSTERED
THEY WERE SCARED BUT THEY DIDN'T REALLY THINK ANYTHING COULD HURT THEM
I DON WANT TO KILL NO BOY AND NO WOMAN
WELL YOU SEE FOR ONE THING THERE'S NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO IN MY PROFESSION
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN IN LOVE SHE HAD NEVER INDULGED IN SENTIMENTAL REVERIES
I'VE MADE MORE ON MY FARMS SINCE I'VE BEEN ALONE THAN WHEN WE ALL WORKED TOGETHER EVERYTHING YOU'VE MADE HAS COME OUT OF THE ORIGINAL LAND THAT US BOYS WORKED FOR HASN'T IT
YOU OUGHT TO GO STRAIGHT TO BED MEDEE AND TELEPHONE FOR THE DOCTOR
THERE WILL BE BARRELS OF BEER
THE RIVER LAND WAS SETTLED BEFORE THIS AND SO THEY ARE A FEW YEARS AHEAD OF US AND HAVE LEARNED MORE ABOUT FARMING
HER FACE WAS SWOLLEN FROM CRYING
THE BOY HAD BEEN LEFT AT THE STORE WHILE HIS SISTER WENT TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND IN HER ABSENCE A DOG HAD CHASED HIS KITTEN UP THE POLE
HE TOOK A LITTLE FLIGHT WITH EACH OF THE MORE ELIGIBLE BOHEMIAN GIRLS BUT IT WAS WHEN HE WAS WITH LITTLE MARIE TOVESKY THAT HE DREW HIS HANDKERCHIEF OUT MOST SLOWLY AND AFTER HE HAD LIT A FRESH CIGAR DROPPED THE MATCH MOST DESPAIRINGLY
THINGS HAS CHANGED SINCE WE WAS GIRLS
I COULD STAY BY A JOB BUT I NEVER HAD THE GO IN ME THAT SHE HAS WHEN I WAS GOING MY BEST
HER FEET SENT BACK A CONTINUAL SPATTER OF MUD
DON'T ASK ME ANYTHING MORE
BUT MY FRIEND IS GOING TO SPEND THE WINTER IN SEATTLE AND I AM TO STAY WITH HIM THERE AND LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT PROSPECTING BEFORE WE START NORTH NEXT YEAR LOU LOOKED SKEPTICAL
MARIE PICKED IT UP AND PLAYED WITH THE WHITE RIBBONS TWISTING THEM ABOUT HER BROWN FINGERS AS SHE TALKED
SHE KNEW AT LAST FOR WHOM IT WAS SHE HAD WAITED AND WHERE HE WOULD CARRY HER
I'M GOING TO PICK CHERRIES
ALEXANDRA HE SAID EARNESTLY IF I GIT OUT-A HERE I NOT TROUBLE DIS COUNTRY NO MORE
THERE'S CARL I HEAR HIS HORSE
BUT THE GREAT FACT WAS THE LAND ITSELF WHICH SEEMED TO OVERWHELM THE LITTLE BEGINNINGS OF HUMAN SOCIETY THAT STRUGGLED IN ITS SOMBRE WASTES
EMIL WENT SOFTLY DOWN BETWEEN THE CHERRY TREES TOWARD THE WHEATFIELD
SOMETIMES YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY AND THEN SOMETIMES YOU PRETEND YOU DON'T
HE HAD BETTER OPPORTUNITIES
IS ANYBODY BUT YOU GOING TO STAND UP WITH HIM
THE FARM PEOPLE WERE MAKING PREPARATIONS TO START FOR HOME
THE LITTLE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED AT THE ADVENT OF A STRANGER SOME ONE FROM VERY FAR AWAY THEY KNEW BY HIS CLOTHES HIS GLOVES AND THE SHARP POINTED CUT OF HIS DARK BEARD
ALEXANDRA ENDURED THEIR ATTENTIONS PATIENTLY BUT SHE WAS GLAD WHEN THEY PUT OUT THE LAMP AND LEFT HER
ON EVERY SIDE THE BROWN WAVES OF THE EARTH ROLLED AWAY TO MEET THE SKY
SHE WAS IN EMIL'S ROOM UPSTAIRS WHEN FROM THE WINDOW SHE SAW IVAR COMING ALONG THE PATH THAT LED FROM THE SHABATAS HE WAS RUNNING LIKE A SPENT MAN TOTTERING AND LURCHING FROM SIDE TO SIDE
I TELL YOU SISTER THE HOGS OF THIS COUNTRY ARE PUT UPON
THERE IS NO NECESSITY NOW
THERE WAS NOTHING YOU COULD DO SO I LET YOU SLEEP
IVAR I WONDER AT YOU THAT YOU SHOULD COME BOTHERING ME WITH SUCH NONSENSE
ME AND LOU'S WORKED HARD AND I CAN'T SEE IT'S GOT US AHEAD MUCH NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT THAT AS WELL AS I DO OSCAR
A PIONEER SHOULD HAVE IMAGINATION SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE IDEA OF THINGS MORE THAN THE THINGS THEMSELVES
EMIL BURST INTO A LAUGH BEFORE THEY WERE OUT OF HEARING
YOU'VE STOOD BY US THROUGH SO MUCH AND HELPED FATHER OUT SO MANY TIMES AND NOW IT SEEMS AS IF WE WERE RUNNING OFF AND LEAVING YOU TO FACE THE WORST OF IT
FROM UP THERE WHERE THEY ARE FLYING OUR COUNTRY LOOKS DARK AND FLAT
NO IVAR NO GUNS ALEXANDRA CALLED REASSURINGLY
UNTIL THEN WE MUST BEAR WITH HER
WE CAN REMEMBER WHEN HALF OUR NEIGHBORS WENT BAREFOOT IN SUMMER
WE WILL NEVER LOSE THE LAND THERE WAS A SOUND OF HEAVY FEET IN THE KITCHEN
BEFORE HE OPENED HIS BIBLE AGAIN IVAR HEARD THE BERGSONS WAGON APPROACHING AND HE SPRANG UP AND RAN TOWARD IT
WHY ARE YOU THINKING OF SUCH THINGS NOW ALEXANDRA I HAD A DREAM BEFORE I WENT TO LINCOLN--BUT I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THAT AFTERWARD AFTER WE ARE MARRIED
ALEXANDRA WATCHED HIM ANXIOUSLY
ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON MRS BERGSON ALWAYS TOOK A NAP AND ALEXANDRA READ
THERE WAS ANOTHER PERIOD OF SILENCE
HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AND TOOK HIS SISTER'S AWKWARDLY
I DON'T SEE MANY PEOPLE BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE MANY LIKE HER ANYWHERE MARIE CAME BACK WITH A BRANCH SHE HAD BROKEN FROM AN APRICOT TREE LADEN WITH PALE YELLOW PINK-CHEEKED FRUIT
THE BREATH OF THE WHEAT AND THE SWEET CLOVER PASSED HIM LIKE PLEASANT THINGS IN A DREAM
ALEXANDRA'S EYES TWINKLED
HE MAKES ME LAUGH
ALEXANDRA HER FATHER OFTEN SAID TO HIMSELF WAS LIKE HER GRANDFATHER
HE'S ONE OF THESE WILD FELLOWS
YOU CAN LEAVE ALL THIS BEHIND YOU NOT EVERYTHING
UPON THE SOMBRE EYES OF THE BOY WHO SEEMED ALREADY TO BE LOOKING INTO THE PAST
WHEN I HEARD IT RAINING IN THE NIGHT I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WOULD COME AND DO IT FOR ME TO-DAY
HERE LET ME TAKE THEM HE SNATCHED THE DUCKS OUT OF HER APRON
WHEN SHE REACHED THE STILE SHE SAT DOWN AND WAITED
OUR LANDLADY AND THE DELICATESSEN MAN ARE OUR MOURNERS AND WE LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND US BUT A FROCK-COAT AND A FIDDLE OR AN EASEL OR A TYPEWRITER OR WHATEVER TOOL WE GOT OUR LIVING BY
EVERYTHING'S CHEAP METAL WORK NOWADAYS TOUCHING UP MISERABLE PHOTOGRAPHS FORCING UP POOR DRAWINGS AND SPOILING GOOD ONES
THERE WAS ONE FANCY INDEED WHICH PERSISTED THROUGH HER GIRLHOOD
WHEN SHE USED TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER SHE WASN'T A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM WHO ALEXANDRA EMIL LAUGHED AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS TROUSERS POCKETS
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING EXCEPT HOW MISERABLE I AM
SHE SAW AT ONCE THAT THEY HAD COME WITH SOME VERY DEFINITE PURPOSE
IT MUST BE CRAZY OR EVERYBODY WOULD BE DOING IT IF THEY WERE WE WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH CHANCE
THE THOUGHT OF GOING INTO A DOORWAY WAS TERRIBLE TO HIM
AS SHE STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT THEM HER FACE CHANGED
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM HAD WIDENED AND HARDENED
BUT COULD YOU COME AWAY LIKE THAT CARL WITHOUT ARRANGING THINGS
THE LITTLE CREATURE HAD NEVER BEEN SO HIGH BEFORE AND SHE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO MOVE
AN I AIN'T NEVER HURT HER
HER MASTER WAS SUNK IN DESPAIR
I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT
HERE AND THERE A WINDMILL GAUNT AGAINST THE SKY A SOD HOUSE CROUCHING IN A HOLLOW
HE WAS BREATHING HARD AS IF HE HAD BEEN RUNNING AND WAS MUTTERING TO HIMSELF
FRANK'S CASE WAS ALL THE MORE PAINFUL BECAUSE HE HAD NO ONE IN PARTICULAR TO FIX HIS JEALOUSY UPON
PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE GETTING TAKEN IN ALEXANDRA SHUT HER ACCOUNT-BOOK FIRMLY
IT CARRIES YOU BACK INTO THE DARK BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
OH I WISH SHE WOULD BE MORE LIKE HERSELF
I GUESS I'D SIT RIGHT DOWN ON THE GROUND AND SAY MY PRAYERS THE BIG BOYS LAUGHED AND OSCAR BRANDISHED HIS WHIP OVER THE BROAD BACKS OF THE HORSES
YET SOMETIMES IN THE PAUSES OF HIS WORK THE YOUNG MAN FROWNED AND LOOKED AT THE GROUND WITH AN INTENTNESS WHICH SUGGESTED THAT EVEN TWENTY-ONE MIGHT HAVE ITS PROBLEMS
IF I WERE YOU I WOULDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM
LOU AND I HAVE DIFFERENT NOTIONS ABOUT FEEDING STOCK AND THAT'S A GOOD THING
I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE THESE MRS LEE
I KNOW HER OO-OO
I WASTE A LOT OF TIME PRETENDING TO PEOPLE AND THE JOKE OF IT IS I DON'T THINK I EVER DECEIVE ANY ONE
MISTRESS HOW CAN ANY ONE THINK THAT?--THAT I COULD BITE THE HAND THAT FED ME THE TEARS TRICKLED DOWN ON THE OLD MAN'S BEARD
YOU BELONG TO THE LAND CARL MURMURED AS YOU HAVE ALWAYS SAID
I SEEM SOMEHOW TO GIVE HIM AWAY ALL THE TIME
WE SIT IN RESTAURANTS AND CONCERT HALLS AND LOOK ABOUT AT THE HUNDREDS OF OUR OWN KIND AND SHUDDER ALEXANDRA WAS SILENT
I HAVE BROUGHT A BUNCH OF EMIL'S LETTERS FOR YOU ALEXANDRA CAME OUT FROM THE SITTING-ROOM AND PINCHED MARIE'S CHEEK PLAYFULLY
OH DO YOU HE ASKED DRYLY
SHE HAD LIVED A DAY OF HER NEW LIFE OF PERFECT LOVE AND IT HAD LEFT HER LIKE THIS
SHE WAS STANDING LOST IN THOUGHT LEANING UPON HER PITCHFORK HER SUNBONNET LYING BESIDE HER ON THE GROUND
BUT HE WAS AS INDOLENT OF MIND AS HE WAS UNSPARING OF HIS BODY
THERE ARE FEW SCENES MORE GRATIFYING THAN A SPRING PLOWING IN THAT COUNTRY WHERE THE FURROWS OF A SINGLE FIELD OFTEN LIE A MILE IN LENGTH AND THE BROWN EARTH WITH SUCH A STRONG CLEAN SMELL AND SUCH A POWER OF GROWTH AND FERTILITY IN IT YIELDS ITSELF EAGERLY TO THE PLOW
MISTRESS HE BEGAN FAINTLY WITHOUT RAISING HIS EYES THE FOLK HAVE BEEN LOOKING COLDLY AT ME OF LATE
ARE THESE THE CIRCUS TREES ALEXANDRA SHALL I TELL HER ABOUT THEM ALEXANDRA ASKED
HE SAT FOR MOST OF THE AFTERNOON IN THE BASEMENT OF THE CHURCH WHERE THE FAIR WAS HELD TALKING TO MARIE SHABATA OR STROLLED ABOUT THE GRAVEL TERRACE THROWN UP ON THE HILLSIDE IN FRONT OF THE BASEMENT DOORS WHERE THE FRENCH BOYS WERE JUMPING AND WRESTLING AND THROWING THE DISCUS
PRESERVING WAS ALMOST A MANIA WITH MRS BERGSON
LOU WAS STILL THE SLIGHTER OF THE TWO THE QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT BUT APT TO GO OFF AT HALF-COCK
HE WORE A FLANNEL CAP AND DUCK TROUSERS AND THE SLEEVES OF HIS WHITE FLANNEL SHIRT WERE ROLLED BACK TO THE ELBOW
SHE WONDERED AT HERSELF NOW BUT SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF DANGER IN THAT DIRECTION
HE MUST HAVE LOOKED FUNNY MARIE WAS THOUGHTFUL
JOHN BERGSON'S FATHER HAD BEEN A SHIPBUILDER A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND OF SOME FORTUNE
LET'S SIT DOWN BY THE GOOSEBERRY BUSHES HE PICKED UP HER SACK OF POTATOES AND THEY CROSSED THE GARDEN
IT WOULD BE SO ANYWAY WITHOUT YOUR SPEAKING
LOU'S WIFE NEEDN'T TALK
AS THEY CAME OUT OF MRS HILLER'S GARDEN THEY TOOK UP THEIR TALK AGAIN WHERE THEY HAD LEFT IT
ALEXANDRA DREW HER SHAWL CLOSER ABOUT HER AND STOOD LEANING AGAINST THE FRAME OF THE MILL LOOKING AT THE STARS WHICH GLITTERED SO KEENLY THROUGH THE FROSTY AUTUMN AIR
I WAS DREAMING THIS SHE WHISPERED HIDING HER FACE AGAINST HIM DON'T TAKE MY DREAM AWAY VII WHEN FRANK SHABATA GOT HOME THAT NIGHT HE FOUND EMIL'S MARE IN HIS STABLE
LET ME HELP YOU MARIE
SHE WAS A SINCERELY DEVOUT GIRL
HE USED TO CARRY IT WHEN I FIRST KNEW HIM
FRANK LAUGHS AT ME FOR FUSSING BUT WHEN THEY DON'T BLOOM HE SAYS WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE DARNED THINGS?'--WHAT DO YOU HEAR FROM CARL ALEXANDRA HE GOT TO DAWSON BEFORE THE RIVER FROZE AND NOW I SUPPOSE I WON'T HEAR ANY MORE UNTIL SPRING
NOT-A FOR ME AMEDEE SWAGGERED
FRANK WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND THREW HIMSELF ON THE SOFA HIS FACE TO THE WALL HIS CLENCHED FIST ON HIS HIP
NEVERTHELESS HE FELT THAT THIS LEAVE-TAKING WOULD BE MORE FINAL THAN HIS EARLIER ONES HAD BEEN
IF A FIELD HAD ONCE BEEN IN CORN HE COULDN'T BEAR TO PUT IT INTO WHEAT
WHAT DOES MILLY WANT OF A PIANNY
IN THAT UNNATURAL QUIET THERE WAS NO SOUND BUT HIS OWN HEAVY BREATHING
I WANT NO QUARRELS AMONG MY CHILDREN AND SO LONG AS THERE IS ONE HOUSE THERE MUST BE ONE HEAD
ALEXANDRA PUT A SOOTHING HAND ON HER MOTHER'S SHOULDER
YOU MUST COME OVER TO SEE MOTHER AND HEAR MILLY PLAY
HAD HIS WIFE BEEN AT HOME HE WOULD HAVE TURNED AND GONE BACK TO HER MEEKLY ENOUGH
AT ONE END NEXT THE RHUBARB GREW FEATHERY ASPARAGUS WITH RED BERRIES
LOU AND OSCAR LOOKED AT EACH OTHER QUESTIONINGLY
SHE COULD BE GAY ABOUT THE LEAST THING IN THE WORLD
I'VE GOT MOST OF WHAT I HAVE NOW SINCE WE DIVIDED THE PROPERTY
HE FELT AS IF A CLEAR LIGHT BROKE UPON HIS MIND AND WITH IT A CONVICTION THAT GOOD WAS AFTER ALL STRONGER THAN EVIL AND THAT GOOD WAS POSSIBLE TO MEN
DOWN THERE THEY HAVE A LITTLE CERTAINTY BUT UP WITH US THERE IS A BIG CHANCE
I'M GLAD YOU'VE COME
WHILE THEY WERE WALKING AMONG THE FLOWER BEDS A BUGGY DROVE UP THE HILL AND STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE GATE
YOU'RE MAKING US ALL RIDICULOUS HOW AM I PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO SAY YOU WANT TO MARRY THE FELLOW WELL AND WHAT IS RIDICULOUS ABOUT THAT LOU AND OSCAR EXCHANGED OUTRAGED LOOKS
ALEXANDRA BECKONED TO THEM
SHE HAD GROWN UP IN SERIOUS TIMES
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THEY MUST FEEL HIS EYES THAT THEY MUST HEAR HIM BREATHING
NO I DON'T WANT ANY SUPPER
BUT REALLY SHE ALMOST CRIED LAST TIME THEY GOT OUT SHE WAS SO SORRY FRANK BOUNCED OVER ON HIS OTHER SIDE
LIKE AN OLD HORSE'S HOOFS THEY ARE--AND THIS FELLOW WEARING GLOVES AND RINGS
THE FARMS AND ALL THAT COMES OUT OF THEM BELONGS TO US AS A FAMILY ALEXANDRA WAVED HER HAND IMPATIENTLY
AND SHE WENT TO THE FRENCH CHURCH WHATEVER THE WEATHER
AT THREE O'CLOCK EMIL FELT THAT HE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
THERE WAS A SHIVER AND A GIGGLE AND EVERY ONE LOOKED TOWARD THE RED BLUR THAT MARIE'S CANDLE MADE IN THE DARK
SHE WISHED ONE OF THEM WOULD STOP AND SPEAK TO HER
NOT UNTIL IT WAS OVER DID SHE REALIZE WHAT IT MEANT
JUST BEFORE BEDTIME OSCAR WENT OUT FOR A PAIL OF WATER
THE COLOR WAS REFLECTED IN THE GLOBULES OF DEW THAT SHEATHED THE SHORT GRAY PASTURE GRASS
NO NOT ANY MORE
YOU'RE KNOCKING THE WIND OUT OF ME
INSTEAD OF IDLING ABOUT IN CALIFORNIA ALL WINTER I SHALL BE GETTING MY BEARINGS UP THERE
YOU'VE RUN UNTIL YOU'VE MADE YOUR HEAD ACHE NOW HAVEN'T YOU
I WOULD HAVE BEEN CUT TO PIECES LITTLE BY LITTLE BEFORE I WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HER TRUST IN ME CARL LOOKED AT THE SHINING SPOT OF WATER BEFORE THEM
OH EMIL YOU WON'T TRY
A DELICIOUS HOT FRAGRANCE BLEW OUT INTO THE TIDY KITCHEN
A MAN PUT HER OUT AND A DOG CHASED HER UP THERE HIS FOREFINGER PROJECTING FROM THE SLEEVE OF HIS COAT POINTED UP TO THE WRETCHED LITTLE CREATURE ON THE POLE
IF ONCE I GET FRANK TO THE SUPPER I'LL SEE THAT I STAY FOR THE DANCE
WE'LL START AN ASYLUM FOR OLD-TIME PEOPLE IVAR IVAR FOLDED HIS BIG HANDKERCHIEF CAREFULLY AND THRUST IT BACK INTO HIS BLOUSE
IT WAS DARK BY THIS TIME
THE BROWN IRIS HE FOUND WAS CURIOUSLY SLASHED WITH YELLOW THE COLOR OF SUNFLOWER HONEY OR OF OLD AMBER
WHAT WOULD YOU DO EMIL IF YOU WAS OUT ON THE PRAIRIE BY YOURSELF AND SEEN HIM COMING EMIL STARED
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND MUCH HE SAID FOR HE DON'T TALK ANY ENGLISH BUT HE KEPT PATTING HER AND GROANING AS IF HE HAD THE PAIN HIMSELF AND SAYING THERE NOW SISTER THAT'S EASIER THAT'S BETTER LOU AND OSCAR LAUGHED AND EMIL GIGGLED DELIGHTEDLY AND LOOKED UP AT HIS SISTER
YET TO HER THEY WERE VERY PERSONAL
HONEST AND TRUE EMIL DON'T YOU WANT ANY GIRL
SHOESTRING AND IRONWEED AND SNOW-ON-THE-MOUNTAIN
HE OUGHT TO HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF WIFE FOR ONE THING
IX ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON A MONTH AFTER CARL LINSTRUM'S ARRIVAL HE RODE WITH EMIL UP INTO THE FRENCH COUNTRY TO ATTEND A CATHOLIC FAIR
WHAT MAKES YOU SO DISCOURAGED I DREAD SIGNING MY NAME TO THEM PIECES OF PAPER HE SAID SLOWLY
SHE WAS AFRAID OF NEVER GETTING THERE
I THINK THEY WERE MORE TO BLAME THAN YOU ALEXANDRA TOO FELT BENUMBED
THE WARDEN WAS A GERMAN A RUDDY CHEERFUL-LOOKING MAN WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN A HARNESS-MAKER
IN FACT IT'S BEEN HIS ENTERPRISE FROM THE BEGINNING YOU KNOW
HE DID NOT SEE HER AND RAN AGAINST HER
HEARING NOTHING HE OPENED THE KITCHEN DOOR AND WENT SOFTLY FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER
DOES SHE REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM
AND THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE IT AND UNDERSTAND IT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO OWN IT--FOR A LITTLE WHILE CARL LOOKED AT HER WONDERINGLY
WORLDLY THOUGHTS LEAVE ONE
BECAUSE FATHER HAD MORE BRAINS
SHE LEFT THE PATH AND WENT ACROSS THE PASTURE
HE WAS SO MUCH IN EARNEST THAT CARL SCARCELY KNEW HOW TO ANSWER HIM
WE'RE A TERRIBLY PRACTICAL PEOPLE AND I GUESS WE THINK A CROSS MAN MAKES A GOOD MANAGER MARIE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AND TURNED TO PIN UP A LOCK OF HAIR THAT HAD FALLEN ON HER NECK
HE WAS OVERWHELMED BY SICKENING MISFORTUNE
IF EMIL WAS ASLEEP THERE WAS NOT EVEN A CHANCE OF HIS COMING
WE'RE WAKING UP TO A SENSE OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES OUT HERE AND WE AIN'T AFRAID NEITHER
I'LL HAVE HIM SENT IN
SOME MISFORTUNE HAS COME UPON US
OSCAR ROLLED HIS EYES
AT THAT MOMENT NELSE APPEARED AT THE GATE WITH THE TWO MILK COWS THAT ALEXANDRA HAD GIVEN SIGNA FOR A WEDDING PRESENT
IT IS THE OLD AND THE POOR AND THE MAIMED WHO SHRINK FROM THAT BROWN HOLE
AMEDEE WAS A LITTLE FELLOW A YEAR YOUNGER THAN EMIL AND MUCH MORE BOYISH IN APPEARANCE
WHEN YOU SENT ME OVER WITH THE STRAWBERRIES THEY WERE ALL IN TOWN BUT THE OLD WOMAN LEE AND THE BABY
THE CRIES FOLLOWED HIM
AS SHE APPROACHED HE SPOKE IN A LOW PLEASANT VOICE
YOU FEED THEM SWILL AND SUCH STUFF
IT MAKES WOMEN CONCEITED TO MEDDLE IN BUSINESS
THEY DID NOT EAT MUCH ALTHOUGH THEY HAD BEEN WORKING IN THE COLD ALL DAY AND THERE WAS A RABBIT STEWED IN GRAVY FOR SUPPER AND PRUNE PIES
IT'S BEEN NICE TO HAVE COMPANY CARL STOPPED THE HORSES AND LOOKED DUBIOUSLY UP AT THE BLACK SKY
HE HAD ON HIS DRILL CAP AND WAS SWINGING HIS BOOKS AT THE END OF A LONG STRAP
THEY KEPT REPEATING THAT AMEDEE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD BOY GLANCING TOWARD THE RED BRICK CHURCH WHICH HAD PLAYED SO LARGE A PART IN AMEDEE'S LIFE HAD BEEN THE SCENE OF HIS MOST SERIOUS MOMENTS AND OF HIS HAPPIEST HOURS
EMIL CAN'T FOOL ME
THAT'S THE WAY IT SEEMS TO ME
IF YOU TAKE EVEN A VINE AND CUT IT BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN IT GROWS HARD LIKE A TREE LOU FELT THAT THEY WERE WANDERING FROM THE POINT AND THAT IN DIGRESSION ALEXANDRA MIGHT UNNERVE HIM
MARIE LEFT THE STILE RELUCTANTLY
THE WHITE MULBERRY TREE I THE FRENCH CHURCH PROPERLY THE CHURCH OF SAINTE-AGNES STOOD UPON A HILL
IT WAS A MUSIC-BOX YOU KNOW AND THE TURKISH LADY PLAYED A TUNE WHILE SHE SMOKED
AS SHE SAT AT THE TABLE SHE KEPT TELLING HER YOUNGEST DAUGHTER TO BE CAREFUL NOW AND NOT DROP ANYTHING ON MOTHER THE CONVERSATION AT THE TABLE WAS ALL IN ENGLISH
BUT I CERTAINLY DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BE THE KIND OF GIRL I WAS
DOES IT SEEM TO YOU LIKE COMING BACK TO YOUR OWN PLACE
ALMOST SORROWFUL AS IF EACH WERE AFRAID OF WAKENING SOMETHING IN THE OTHER
I DON'T FEEL SO COLD NOW
I COULDN'T BUY EVEN ONE OF YOUR CORNFIELDS
THE COUNTRY CHILDREN THEREABOUTS WORE THEIR DRESSES TO THEIR SHOE-TOPS BUT THIS CITY CHILD WAS DRESSED IN WHAT WAS THEN CALLED THE KATE GREENAWAY MANNER AND HER RED CASHMERE FROCK GATHERED FULL FROM THE YOKE CAME ALMOST TO THE FLOOR
WHEN EMIL SAID HE WAS HUNGRY THEY DREW BACK FROM THE ROAD GAVE BRIGHAM HIS OATS AMONG THE BUSHES AND CLIMBED UP TO THE TOP OF A GRASSY BLUFF TO EAT THEIR LUNCH UNDER THE SHADE OF SOME LITTLE ELM TREES
