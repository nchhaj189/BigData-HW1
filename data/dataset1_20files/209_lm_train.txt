I STAY ON AS YOUR FRIEND AND FROM THE TREMENDOUS INTEREST I TAKE IN YOU TILL SOMETHING CAN BE DONE FOR YOU THAT MAY BE MORE WORTH YOUR WHILE
THEY WON'T TAKE HIM THEY ABSOLUTELY DECLINE AT THIS SHE RAISED HER EYES WHICH SHE HAD TURNED FROM ME
SO UNUTTERABLY TOUCHING WAS IT TO SEE HIS LITTLE BRAIN PUZZLED AND HIS LITTLE RESOURCES TAXED TO PLAY UNDER THE SPELL LAID ON HIM A PART OF INNOCENCE AND CONSISTENCY
I'LL GO THIS MORNING I WANTED TO BE VERY JUST
WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
ISN'T THAT WOMAN ALWAYS WITHOUT ONE SHE'S WITH HER SHE'S WITH HER I DECLARED
AFTER DINNER YOU'LL ALL MEET ME HERE HE LOOKED US ROUND AGAIN
THEN I WENT ON
HE WAS GENTLENESS ITSELF AND WHILE I WAGGED MY HEAD AT HIM HE STOOD THERE MORE THAN EVER A LITTLE FAIRY PRINCE
WHICH AS OUR FRIEND IMMEDIATELY LEFT US AGAIN WAS THE ONLY OTHER WORD OF IMPORTANCE CONTRIBUTED TO THE SUBJECT TILL THE NEXT NIGHT BY THE CORNER OF THE HEARTH IN THE BEST CHAIR HE OPENED THE FADED RED COVER OF A THIN OLD-FASHIONED GILT-EDGED ALBUM
WE WAITED IN FACT TILL TWO NIGHTS LATER
I KNEW NONETHELESS EXACTLY WHAT DREADFUL FACE SHE HAD TO SHOW
THIS WAS NOT SO GOOD A THING I ADMIT AS NOT TO LEAVE ME TO JUDGE THAT WHAT ESSENTIALLY MADE NOTHING ELSE MUCH SIGNIFY WAS SIMPLY MY CHARMING WORK
I WAS PROMPTLY ON MY FEET OF COURSE AND WITH AN IMMENSE DEAL TO ASK
ISN'T ANYBODY GOING IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE
FOR THE WAY IN WHICH A MAN PAYS HIS HIGHEST TRIBUTE TO A WOMAN IS APT TO BE BUT BY THE MORE FESTAL CELEBRATION OF ONE OF THE SACRED LAWS OF HIS COMFORT
SHE HAD DONE FOR THEM QUITE BEAUTIFULLY--SHE WAS A MOST RESPECTABLE PERSON--TILL HER DEATH THE GREAT AWKWARDNESS OF WHICH HAD PRECISELY LEFT NO ALTERNATIVE BUT THE SCHOOL FOR LITTLE MILES
I SEE
I SEE
IT IS RATHER ODD THAT HE HAS NEVER SPOKEN OF HIM NEVER BY THE LEAST ALLUSION
NOT AT ALL
SHE WISHED OF COURSE--SMALL BLAME TO HER!--TO SINK THE WHOLE SUBJECT
I ONLY REMEMBER THAT I WAS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY QUIET AND THAT FLORA WAS PLAYING VERY HARD
HE GAVE ME ANOTHER LOOK CHARGED WITH THAT EXPRESSION AND THEN MARCHED OFF ALONE INTO CHURCH
STRANGER THAN I CAN EXPRESS CERTAINLY WAS THE EFFORT TO STRUGGLE AGAINST MY NEW LIGHTS
WHEREUPON MRS GRIFFIN SPOKE
AND I LIKED IT BEST OF ALL WHEN AS THE LIGHT FADED--OR RATHER I SHOULD SAY THE DAY LINGERED AND THE LAST CALLS OF THE LAST BIRDS SOUNDED IN A FLUSHED SKY FROM THE OLD TREES--I COULD TAKE A TURN INTO THE GROUNDS AND ENJOY ALMOST WITH A SENSE OF PROPERTY THAT AMUSED AND FLATTERED ME THE BEAUTY AND DIGNITY OF THE PLACE
HE WAS HANDSOME AND BOLD AND PLEASANT OFFHAND AND GAY AND KIND
CERTAINLY
BUT IT WAS A COMFORT THAT THERE COULD BE NO UNEASINESS IN A CONNECTION WITH ANYTHING SO BEATIFIC AS THE RADIANT IMAGE OF MY LITTLE GIRL THE VISION OF WHOSE ANGELIC BEAUTY HAD PROBABLY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO DO WITH THE RESTLESSNESS THAT BEFORE MORNING MADE ME SEVERAL TIMES RISE AND WANDER ABOUT MY ROOM TO TAKE IN THE WHOLE PICTURE AND PROSPECT
WE WERE TOO FAR APART TO CALL TO EACH OTHER BUT THERE WAS A MOMENT AT WHICH AT SHORTER RANGE SOME CHALLENGE BETWEEN US BREAKING THE HUSH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT RESULT OF OUR STRAIGHT MUTUAL STARE
BUT EVEN WHILE THEY PRETEND TO BE LOST IN THEIR FAIRYTALE THEY'RE STEEPED IN THEIR VISION OF THE DEAD RESTORED
I KISSED HIS FOREHEAD
THIS AT ALL EVENTS WAS FOR THE TIME
PARALYZED WHILE IT LASTED BY THE MERE BRUSH OF THE QUESTION I LET HIM GO A LITTLE SO THAT WITH A DEEP-DRAWN SIGH HE TURNED AWAY FROM ME AGAIN
AND THE SUCCESS OF THE TEMPTERS IS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME
ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT MIGHT HAVE STRUCK US THAT ALMOST EVERY BRANCH OF STUDY OR SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION SKIRTED FORBIDDEN GROUND
IT WAS USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO CONVEY TO MRS GROSE JUST AS IT IS SCARCELY LESS SO TO ATTEMPT TO SUGGEST HERE HOW IN OUR SHORT STIFF BRUSH IN THE DARK HE FAIRLY SHOOK ME WITH ADMIRATION
AND ALL THE MORE FOR AN INCIDENT THAT PRESENTING ITSELF THE SECOND EVENING HAD DEEPLY DISCONCERTED ME
THE PLACE MOREOVER IN THE STRANGEST WAY IN THE WORLD HAD ON THE INSTANT AND BY THE VERY FACT OF ITS APPEARANCE BECOME A SOLITUDE
MEANWHILE THERE HAD BEEN ON THE PART OF MY PUPILS NO MORE BRILLIANT MORE EXEMPLARY MORNING
SHE GAVE ME NEVER A GLANCE
LOOKING IN WHAT EXTRAORDINARY MAN I HAVEN'T THE LEAST IDEA MRS GROSE GAZED ROUND US IN VAIN
BUT NOT NOW WHY NOT NOW MY INSISTENCE TURNED HIM FROM ME AND KEPT HIM ONCE MORE AT HIS WINDOW IN A SILENCE DURING WHICH BETWEEN US YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD A PIN DROP
THERE WAS CLEARLY ANOTHER PERSON ABOVE ME--THERE WAS A PERSON ON THE TOWER
AND I MAY AS WELL SAY AT ONCE THAT I ON NO OTHER OCCASION SAW HIM IN THE HOUSE
HIM HE OUGHT TO BE HERE--HE OUGHT TO HELP I QUICKLY ROSE AND I THINK I MUST HAVE SHOWN HER A QUEERER FACE THAN EVER YET
I SEIZED MY COLLEAGUE'S ARM
BUT NOT TO THE OLD PLACE--WE MUST FIND ANOTHER A BETTER
THE SCHOOLROOM PIANO BROKE INTO ALL GRUESOME FANCIES
BUT OH HOW I FELT THAT AT PRESENT I MUST PICK MY OWN PHRASES
MUCH AS WE HAD DISCUSSED IT THAT SUNDAY NIGHT I WAS IN THE IMMEDIATE LATER HOURS IN ESPECIAL--FOR IT MAY BE IMAGINED WHETHER I SLEPT--STILL HAUNTED WITH THE SHADOW OF SOMETHING SHE HAD NOT TOLD ME
IT WAS A TIGHTER PLACE STILL THAN I HAD YET TURNED ROUND IN
THEY HAD NEVER I THINK WANTED TO DO SO MANY THINGS FOR THEIR POOR PROTECTRESS
AS SOON AS I HAD DONE SO I USED TO SAY TO MYSELF
MEANWHILE OF COURSE THE PROSPECT STRUCK HER AS SLIGHTLY GRIM
THERE WAS EVEN A SINGULAR LITTLE DIGNITY IN IT SOMETHING THAT MADE ME RELEASE HIM YET WHEN I HAD SLOWLY RISEN LINGER BESIDE HIM
THIS MOMENT DATED FROM AN AFTERNOON HOUR THAT I HAPPENED TO SPEND IN THE GROUNDS WITH THE YOUNGER OF MY PUPILS ALONE
AH MISS I'M NOT SUCH A FOOL AS THAT
NO--I SUPPOSE WE SHOULDN'T
LOOK HERE MY DEAR YOU KNOW HE CHARMINGLY SAID WHEN IN THE WORLD PLEASE AM I GOING BACK TO SCHOOL TRANSCRIBED HERE THE SPEECH SOUNDS HARMLESS ENOUGH PARTICULARLY AS UTTERED IN THE SWEET HIGH CASUAL PIPE WITH WHICH AT ALL INTERLOCUTORS BUT ABOVE ALL AT HIS ETERNAL GOVERNESS HE THREW OFF INTONATIONS AS IF HE WERE TOSSING ROSES
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN NOW
THE NOTE AT ANY RATE THAT I PUT ON THE TABLE YESTERDAY I PURSUED WILL HAVE GIVEN HIM SO SCANT AN ADVANTAGE--FOR IT CONTAINED ONLY THE BARE DEMAND FOR AN INTERVIEW--THAT HE IS ALREADY MUCH ASHAMED OF HAVING GONE SO FAR FOR SO LITTLE AND THAT WHAT HE HAD ON HIS MIND LAST EVENING WAS PRECISELY THE NEED OF CONFESSION I SEEMED TO MYSELF FOR THE INSTANT TO HAVE MASTERED IT TO SEE IT ALL
THE HOMAGE OF WHICH THEY WERE SO LAVISH SUCCEEDED IN TRUTH FOR MY NERVES QUITE AS WELL AS IF I NEVER APPEARED TO MYSELF AS I MAY SAY LITERALLY TO CATCH THEM AT A PURPOSE IN IT
BY WHICH I MEAN THAT IT SUITED EXACTLY THE PARTICULARLY DEADLY VIEW I WAS IN THE VERY ACT OF FORBIDDING MYSELF TO ENTERTAIN
THE CHILDREN WERE TUCKED AWAY AND I HAD COME OUT FOR MY STROLL
AND BEFORE YOU WENT AWAY FOR SOME TIME HE WAS SILENT BUT HE CONTINUED TO MEET MY EYES
THAT SHE SUFFERS THE TORMENTS IT WAS THIS OF A TRUTH THAT MADE HER AS SHE FILLED OUT MY PICTURE GAPE
SHE WAS TAKEN ILL YOU MEAN AND WENT HOME SHE WAS NOT TAKEN ILL SO FAR AS APPEARED IN THIS HOUSE
WELL THERE'S THAT AWFUL REASON THERE WERE NOW CLEARLY SO MANY OF THESE FOR MY POOR COLLEAGUE THAT SHE WAS EXCUSABLE FOR BEING VAGUE
HIS DERISION HIS AMUSEMENT HIS CONTEMPT FOR THE BREAKDOWN OF MY RESIGNATION AT BEING LEFT ALONE AND FOR THE FINE MACHINERY I HAD SET IN MOTION TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION TO MY SLIGHTED CHARMS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU WHY IT'S THAT THE CHILD MAY KEEP IT UP--AND THAT THE CHILD ASSUREDLY WILL--WITHOUT MY KNOWING IT AT THE IMAGE OF THIS POSSIBILITY MRS GROSE FOR A MOMENT COLLAPSED YET PRESENTLY TO PULL HERSELF TOGETHER AGAIN AS IF FROM THE POSITIVE FORCE OF THE SENSE OF WHAT SHOULD WE YIELD AN INCH THERE WOULD REALLY BE TO GIVE WAY TO
OH BUT YOU KNOW SHE QUITE ADEQUATELY ANSWERED THAT YOU MIGHT COME BACK YOU DEAR AND THAT YOU HAVE AND AFTER A LITTLE WHEN SHE HAD GOT INTO BED I HAD FOR A LONG TIME BY ALMOST SITTING ON HER TO HOLD HER HAND TO PROVE THAT I RECOGNIZED THE PERTINENCE OF MY RETURN
I WANT TO GET AWAY YOU'RE TIRED OF BLY OH NO I LIKE BLY WELL THEN OH YOU KNOW WHAT A BOY WANTS I FELT THAT I DIDN'T KNOW SO WELL AS MILES AND I TOOK TEMPORARY REFUGE
NOT A WORD
HIS UNCLE SHALL HAVE IT HERE FROM ME ON THE SPOT AND BEFORE THE BOY HIMSELF IF NECESSARY THAT IF I'M TO BE REPROACHED WITH HAVING DONE NOTHING AGAIN ABOUT MORE SCHOOL YES MISS MY COMPANION PRESSED ME
BUT--A--WHICH WHY THE LETTER FROM HIS OLD PLACE YOU'LL SHOW IT TO THE MASTER I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE SO ON THE INSTANT OH NO SAID MRS GROSE WITH DECISION
I'VE A BETTER IDEA--THE RESULT OF MY REFLECTIONS
DEAR LITTLE MILES"--OH I BROUGHT IT OUT NOW EVEN IF I SHOULD GO TOO FAR--"I JUST WANT YOU TO HELP ME TO SAVE YOU BUT I KNEW IN A MOMENT AFTER THIS THAT I HAD GONE TOO FAR
THE MAIDS AND THE MEN LOOKED BLANK
I QUITE AGREE--IN REGARD TO GRIFFIN'S GHOST OR WHATEVER IT WAS--THAT ITS APPEARING FIRST TO THE LITTLE BOY AT SO TENDER AN AGE ADDS A PARTICULAR TOUCH
I SUPPOSE I HAD EXPECTED OR HAD DREADED SOMETHING SO MELANCHOLY THAT WHAT GREETED ME WAS A GOOD SURPRISE
IT WAS A PITY THAT SOMEHOW TO SETTLE THIS ONCE FOR ALL I HAD EQUALLY TO RE-ENUMERATE THE SIGNS OF SUBTLETY THAT IN THE AFTERNOON BY THE LAKE HAD MADE A MIRACLE OF MY SHOW OF SELF-POSSESSION
MY ELDER COMPANION THE NEXT MOMENT AT ANY RATE BLOTTED OUT EVERYTHING BUT HER OWN FLUSHED FACE AND HER LOUD SHOCKED PROTEST A BURST OF HIGH DISAPPROVAL
SHE SHOWED IT STEP BY STEP AND ROOM BY ROOM AND SECRET BY SECRET WITH DROLL DELIGHTFUL CHILDISH TALK ABOUT IT AND WITH THE RESULT IN HALF AN HOUR OF OUR BECOMING IMMENSE FRIENDS
SHE SAW ME AS I HAD SEEN MY OWN VISITANT
IT'S FAR WORSE THAN I DREAMED--THEY'RE LOST VIII WHAT I HAD SAID TO MRS GROSE WAS TRUE ENOUGH
HE COULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FINDS IT IT WAS TO ME IN PARTICULAR THAT HE APPEARED TO PROPOUND THIS--APPEARED ALMOST TO APPEAL FOR AID NOT TO HESITATE
SHE SAW HIM ONLY TWICE YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION A LITTLE TO MY SURPRISE ON THIS DOUGLAS TURNED ROUND TO ME
I REMEMBER AS A MOST PLEASANT IMPRESSION THE BROAD CLEAR FRONT ITS OPEN WINDOWS AND FRESH CURTAINS AND THE PAIR OF MAIDS LOOKING OUT
LATER IN THE EVENING I HAD THE CHANCE TO QUESTION LUKE AND HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD NEITHER NOTICED NOR TOUCHED IT WE COULD ONLY EXCHANGE ON THIS ONE OF OUR DEEPER MUTUAL SOUNDINGS AND IT WAS MRS GROSE WHO FIRST BROUGHT UP THE PLUMB WITH AN ALMOST ELATED YOU SEE YES I SEE THAT IF MILES TOOK IT INSTEAD HE PROBABLY WILL HAVE READ IT AND DESTROYED IT AND DON'T YOU SEE ANYTHING ELSE I FACED HER A MOMENT WITH A SAD SMILE
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU CALL MUCH YES"--WITH ALL ACCOMMODATION--"EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON THIS HOWEVER HE FACED TO THE WINDOW AGAIN AND PRESENTLY REACHED IT WITH HIS VAGUE RESTLESS COGITATING STEP
THEN I SAW SOMETHING MORE
I REFLECTED THAT MY FIRST DUTY WAS BY THE GENTLEST ARTS I COULD CONTRIVE TO WIN THE CHILD INTO THE SENSE OF KNOWING ME
AND HIM WHO THINKS SO WELL OF YOU HE HAS AN ODD WAY--IT COMES OVER ME NOW I LAUGHED,"--OF PROVING IT
THE APPARITION HAD REACHED THE LANDING HALFWAY UP AND WAS THEREFORE ON THE SPOT NEAREST THE WINDOW WHERE AT SIGHT OF ME IT STOPPED SHORT AND FIXED ME EXACTLY AS IT HAD FIXED ME FROM THE TOWER AND FROM THE GARDEN
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT BUT HE DIDN'T MOVE AND HE PRESENTLY PRODUCED SOMETHING THAT MADE ME DROP STRAIGHT DOWN ON THE STONE SLAB AS IF SUDDENLY TO REST
SOMETHING OR OTHER HAD BROUGHT NEARER HOME TO ME THAT I HAD ALL BUT PINNED THE BOY TO MY SHAWL AND THAT IN THE WAY OUR COMPANIONS WERE MARSHALED BEFORE ME I MIGHT HAVE APPEARED TO PROVIDE AGAINST SOME DANGER OF REBELLION
YOU SHALL HEAR TOMORROW WHAT SHE LEARNED
I DON'T THINK YOUR UNCLE MUCH CARES MILES ON THIS STOOD LOOKING AT ME
I REACHED THE HOUSE DOOR AND OPENED IT
WHEN DO YOU THINK HE WILL COME
SHE WENT STRAIGHT OVER LAWS CRIED MY FRIEND AGAIN
SHE HAD TURNED COMMON AND ALMOST UGLY
WE CONTINUED SILENT WHILE THE MAID WAS WITH US--AS SILENT IT WHIMSICALLY OCCURRED TO ME AS SOME YOUNG COUPLE WHO ON THEIR WEDDING JOURNEY AT THE INN FEEL SHY IN THE PRESENCE OF THE WAITER
AH MISS IT ISN'T A MATTER ON WHICH I CAN PUSH HER
I SPENT THE DAY WITH HER OUT-OF-DOORS
YOU WEREN'T AFRAID OF ANYTHING ELSE
NOW I WAS I SAID TO MYSELF FACE TO FACE WITH THE ELEMENTS AND FOR MUCH OF THE REST OF THE DAY WHILE I FOUGHT MY WEAKNESS I COULD CONSIDER THAT I HAD BEEN SUPREMELY RASH
IT'S YOU WHO MUST GO
I DON'T WONDER YOU LOOKED QUEER I PERSISTED WHEN I MENTIONED TO YOU THE LETTER FROM HIS SCHOOL I DOUBT IF I LOOKED AS QUEER AS YOU SHE RETORTED WITH HOMELY FORCE
PERHAPS SHE LIKES IT LIKES SUCH THINGS--A SCRAP OF AN INFANT ISN'T IT JUST A PROOF OF HER BLESSED INNOCENCE MY FRIEND BRAVELY INQUIRED
I ONLY KNEW THAT AT THE END OF I SUPPOSE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AN ODOROUS DAMPNESS AND ROUGHNESS CHILLING AND PIERCING MY TROUBLE HAD MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT I MUST HAVE THROWN MYSELF ON MY FACE ON THE GROUND AND GIVEN WAY TO A WILDNESS OF GRIEF
HE HAD BEEN ANXIOUS ALL DAY AND EVEN WHILE IN HIS USUAL SWEET LITTLE MANNER HE SAT AT TABLE HAD NEEDED ALL HIS SMALL STRANGE GENIUS TO GIVE IT A GLOSS
THERE WERE OTHERS HE WENT ON WHO HADN'T SUCCUMBED
WHERE MY PET IS MISS JESSEL XX JUST AS IN THE CHURCHYARD WITH MILES THE WHOLE THING WAS UPON US
TO CORRUPT SHE STARED TAKING MY MEANING IN
THE FLASH OF THIS KNOWLEDGE--FOR IT WAS KNOWLEDGE IN THE MIDST OF DREAD--PRODUCED IN ME THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY EFFECT STARTED AS I STOOD THERE A SUDDEN VIBRATION OF DUTY AND COURAGE
YOU MUST KNOW NOW
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SURE SHE WANTED TO GO BACK ALONE
HE WAS IRREPROACHABLE AS ALWAYS TODAY
YOU WANT TO GO TO YOUR UNCLE AGAIN AT THIS WITH HIS SWEET IRONIC FACE HE MADE A MOVEMENT ON THE PILLOW
THEN I POINTED OUT THAT THE BOAT MIGHT PERFECTLY BE IN A SMALL REFUGE FORMED BY ONE OF THE RECESSES OF THE POOL AN INDENTATION MASKED FOR THE HITHER SIDE BY A PROJECTION OF THE BANK AND BY A CLUMP OF TREES GROWING CLOSE TO THE WATER
IT WAS ALL THERE
SHE HERSELF EXPLAINED FOR THAT MATTER WITH THE LOVELIEST EAGEREST SIMPLICITY
FOR GENERAL UNCANNY UGLINESS AND HORROR AND PAIN WELL THEN I SAID JUST SIT RIGHT DOWN AND BEGIN HE TURNED ROUND TO THE FIRE GAVE A KICK TO A LOG WATCHED IT AN INSTANT
FOR THE TRUTH I HAD NOW TO TURN OVER WAS SIMPLY AND CLEARLY THE TRUTH THAT I COULD ARRIVE AT NO ACCOUNT WHATEVER OF THE VISITOR WITH WHOM I HAD BEEN SO INEXPLICABLY AND YET AS IT SEEMED TO ME SO INTIMATELY CONCERNED
I WONDERED WHY SHE SHOULD BE SCARED
HERE AT PRESENT I FELT AFRESH--FOR I HAD FELT IT AGAIN AND AGAIN--HOW MY EQUILIBRIUM DEPENDED ON THE SUCCESS OF MY RIGID WILL THE WILL TO SHUT MY EYES AS TIGHT AS POSSIBLE TO THE TRUTH THAT WHAT I HAD TO DEAL WITH WAS REVOLTINGLY AGAINST NATURE
HE HAD COME FOR SOMEONE ELSE
BUT IF I DID YOU KNOW THERE'S A THING I SHOULD REQUIRE NOW JUST WITHOUT SPARING YOU THE LEAST BIT MORE--OH NOT A SCRAP COME!--TO GET OUT OF YOU
COME HERE AND TAKE YOUR MUTTON HE ALERTLY OBEYED ME CARRIED THE PLATE CAREFULLY TO HIS SEAT AND WHEN HE WAS ESTABLISHED WENT ON
BUT TO WHAT END WHY THAT OF DEALING WITH ME TO HER UNCLE
I SEEMED TO FLOAT NOT INTO CLEARNESS BUT INTO A DARKER OBSCURE AND WITHIN A MINUTE THERE HAD COME TO ME OUT OF MY VERY PITY THE APPALLING ALARM OF HIS BEING PERHAPS INNOCENT
HOW CAN I RETRACE TODAY THE STRANGE STEPS OF MY OBSESSION
AND IN THE MIDST OF IT SHE CAME CAME HOW--FROM WHERE FROM WHERE THEY COME FROM
THEN INSTINCTIVELY INSTEAD OF RETURNING AS I HAD COME WENT TO THE WINDOW
HE NEVER WROTE TO THEM--THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SELFISH BUT IT WAS A PART OF THE FLATTERY OF HIS TRUST OF ME
THE FIRST DAY HAD BEEN ON THE WHOLE AS I HAVE EXPRESSED REASSURING
AH YOU CAN'T GET OFF WITH THAT I WAS SILENT A LITTLE AND IT WAS I NOW I THINK WHO CHANGED COLOR
THIS CHILD TO MY MEMORY REALLY LIVES IN A SETTING OF BEAUTY AND MISERY THAT NO WORDS CAN TRANSLATE
I HAD NO DROP AGAIN TILL THE NEXT DAY FOR I WAS CARRIED TRIUMPHANTLY THROUGH THE FOLLOWING HOURS BY MY INTRODUCTION TO THE YOUNGER OF MY PUPILS
SHE ROSE NOT AS IF SHE HAD HEARD ME BUT WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE GRAND MELANCHOLY OF INDIFFERENCE AND DETACHMENT AND WITHIN A DOZEN FEET OF ME STOOD THERE AS MY VILE PREDECESSOR
OF WHAT QUEER BUSINESS MILES WHY THE WAY YOU BRING ME UP
I SAW HIM AS I SEE YOU THEN HOW DID HE GET IN AND HOW DID HE GET OUT I LAUGHED
THIS WAS A SPECTACLE THEY SEEMED ACTIVELY TO PREPARE AND THAT ENGAGED ME AS AN ACTIVE ADMIRER
I CAN HEAR AGAIN AS I WRITE THE INTENSE HUSH IN WHICH THE SOUNDS OF EVENING DROPPED
DO YOU LIKE IT BETTER MY FACE HAD MADE HER RUEFUL
SAY THAT BY THE DARK PRODIGY I KNEW THE IMAGINATION OF ALL EVIL HAD BEEN OPENED UP TO HIM
THIS WAS WHY I HAD NOW GIVEN TO MRS GROSE'S STEPS SO MARKED A DIRECTION--A DIRECTION THAT MADE HER WHEN SHE PERCEIVED IT OPPOSE A RESISTANCE THAT SHOWED ME SHE WAS FRESHLY MYSTIFIED
HE SEEMS TO LIKE US YOUNG AND PRETTY OH HE DID MRS GROSE ASSENTED
ALONE ALONE WITH US THEN AS FROM A DEEPER DEPTH IN CHARGE SHE ADDED
IT WAS QUITE BEYOND ANY OF THE OTHERS
THE SUMMER HAD TURNED THE SUMMER HAD GONE
BUT I WAS TO BE LATER ON SO MUCH MORE OVERWHELMED THAT THIS MERE DAWN OF ALARM WAS A COMPARATIVELY HUMAN CHILL
AND THERE WOULD BE A GREATNESS IN LETTING IT BE SEEN--OH IN THE RIGHT QUARTER!--THAT I COULD SUCCEED WHERE MANY ANOTHER GIRL MIGHT HAVE FAILED
SO THAT WHEN WE MET ONCE MORE IN THE WONDER OF IT WE WERE OF A COMMON MIND ABOUT THE DUTY OF RESISTANCE TO EXTRAVAGANT FANCIES
IT'S A GAME I WENT ON
IT SOUNDED DULL--IT SOUNDED STRANGE
AND DID THEY REPEAT WHAT YOU SAID I WENT ON AFTER A MOMENT
NOTHING AND TO HIS UNCLE I WAS INCISIVE
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE ROOM THE NEXT MINUTE BUT THE SUNSHINE AND A SENSE THAT I MUST STAY
THE DAY WAS GRAY ENOUGH BUT THE AFTERNOON LIGHT STILL LINGERED AND IT ENABLED ME ON CROSSING THE THRESHOLD NOT ONLY TO RECOGNIZE ON A CHAIR NEAR THE WIDE WINDOW THEN CLOSED THE ARTICLES I WANTED BUT TO BECOME AWARE OF A PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WINDOW AND LOOKING STRAIGHT IN
WHICH INDEED SHE BACKED UP BY A FURTHER REMARK
YET EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THEM HE RETURNED STILL WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND PLANTED THERE IN FRONT OF ME THEY DON'T MUCH COUNT DO THEY I MADE THE BEST OF IT BUT I FELT WAN
THE WHOLE THING TOOK INDEED MORE NIGHTS THAN ONE BUT ON THE FIRST OCCASION THE SAME LADY PUT ANOTHER QUESTION
HE WANTS TO APPEAR TO THEM THAT HE MIGHT WAS AN AWFUL CONCEPTION AND YET SOMEHOW I COULD KEEP IT AT BAY
THE NEXT THING SHE DID HOWEVER WAS TO STOOP STRAIGHT DOWN AND PLUCK--QUITE AS IF IT WERE ALL SHE WAS THERE FOR--A BIG UGLY SPRAY OF WITHERED FERN
HIS VOICE TINKLED OUT
AND YOU FORGAVE HIM THAT WOULDN'T YOU OH YES AND WE EXCHANGED THERE IN THE STILLNESS A SOUND OF THE ODDEST AMUSEMENT
AND THEN MILES'S SHE LOOKED AT ME HARD
THE BEST WAY TO PICTURE IT ALL IS TO SAY THAT I WAS OFF MY GUARD
DO YOU THINK HE WON'T IF HE HAS THE CHANCE TURN ON ME
YOU SEEMED SO PERFECTLY TO ACCEPT THE PRESENT IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY HOW MY ABSOLUTE CONVICTION OF HIS SECRET PRECOCITY OR WHATEVER I MIGHT CALL THE POISON OF AN INFLUENCE THAT I DARED BUT HALF TO PHRASE MADE HIM IN SPITE OF THE FAINT BREATH OF HIS INWARD TROUBLE APPEAR AS ACCESSIBLE AS AN OLDER PERSON--IMPOSED HIM ALMOST AS AN INTELLECTUAL EQUAL
READ HIM PLEASE
THEN WHERE IS IT OUR NOT SEEING IT IS THE STRONGEST OF PROOFS
IF I DO YOU WILL BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN WELL THAT I THINK IS WHAT I CAME FOR--TO BE CARRIED AWAY
GET OFF WITH HIS SISTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND LEAVE ME WITH HIM ALONE I WAS AMAZED MYSELF AT THE SPIRIT I HAD STILL IN RESERVE AND THEREFORE PERHAPS A TRIFLE THE MORE DISCONCERTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH IN SPITE OF THIS FINE EXAMPLE OF IT SHE HESITATED
I'M OFF I BROKE THE SEAL WITH A GREAT EFFORT--SO GREAT A ONE THAT I WAS A LONG TIME COMING TO IT
IF NOTHING HAD PASSED ONE OF US WOULD HAVE MOVED
THE NEXT THING I SAW WAS THAT FROM OUTSIDE HE HAD REACHED THE WINDOW AND THEN I KNEW THAT CLOSE TO THE GLASS AND GLARING IN THROUGH IT HE OFFERED ONCE MORE TO THE ROOM HIS WHITE FACE OF DAMNATION
THERE WERE IN THE MATTER I HAD PUT BEFORE HER DEPTHS AND POSSIBILITIES THAT I LACKED RESOLUTION TO SOUND
OF WHAT DID SHE DIE
I WAS IN RECEIPT IN THESE DAYS OF DISTURBING LETTERS FROM HOME WHERE THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL
NOT OF HIS EFFECT HIS EFFECT SHE REPEATED WITH A FACE OF ANGUISH AND WAITING WHILE I FALTERED
I ADJURED HIM TO WRITE BY THE FIRST POST AND TO AGREE WITH US FOR AN EARLY HEARING
WHAT WERE THESE THINGS MY STERNNESS WAS ALL FOR HIS JUDGE HIS EXECUTIONER
SHE MUST LEAVE IT SHE HELD ME A MOMENT WITH HEAVY EYES THEN BROUGHT OUT THE REST
THE RESULT OF OUR HAVING EVERYTHING OUT WAS SIMPLY TO REDUCE OUR SITUATION TO THE LAST RIGOR OF ITS ELEMENTS
HE HAD WISHED TO FINISH A BOOK AND I HAD BEEN GLAD TO ENCOURAGE A PURPOSE SO LAUDABLE IN A YOUNG MAN WHOSE ONLY DEFECT WAS AN OCCASIONAL EXCESS OF THE RESTLESS
THEY KNOW--IT'S TOO MONSTROUS
DO THE GENTLEMEN SAY SO THEY GO INTO NO PARTICULARS
I QUICKENED OUR STEP
THE WRETCHED CHILD HAD SPOKEN EXACTLY AS IF SHE HAD GOT FROM SOME OUTSIDE SOURCE EACH OF HER STABBING LITTLE WORDS AND I COULD THEREFORE IN THE FULL DESPAIR OF ALL I HAD TO ACCEPT BUT SADLY SHAKE MY HEAD AT HER
SHE DIDN'T FORBID HIM I CONSIDERED
THEIR MORE THAN EARTHLY BEAUTY THEIR ABSOLUTELY UNNATURAL GOODNESS
YET I CAN'T BEAR IT THE POOR WOMAN WENT ON WHILE WITH THE SAME MOVEMENT SHE GLANCED ON MY DRESSING TABLE AT THE FACE OF MY WATCH
HE PAUSED A MOMENT BY THE DOOR AS IF TO LOOK AT ME
NOTHING COULD BE MORE CHARMING THAN THE WAY YOU TAKE IT FOR OF COURSE IF WE'RE ALONE TOGETHER NOW IT'S YOU THAT ARE ALONE MOST
COMING DOWNSTAIRS TO MEET MY COLLEAGUE IN THE HALL I REMEMBERED A PAIR OF GLOVES THAT HAD REQUIRED THREE STITCHES AND THAT HAD RECEIVED THEM--WITH A PUBLICITY PERHAPS NOT EDIFYING--WHILE I SAT WITH THE CHILDREN AT THEIR TEA SERVED ON SUNDAYS BY EXCEPTION IN THAT COLD CLEAN TEMPLE OF MAHOGANY AND BRASS THE GROWN-UP DINING ROOM
BUT AT THE MOMENT I TOOK THIS IN I HAD ALREADY BECOME AWARE THAT IN SPITE OF MY ENTRANCE HER ATTITUDE STRANGELY PERSISTED
I TOOK IT IN WITH A THROB OF HOPE
I COULD ENGAGE THAT TO THE WORLD MY FACE SHOULD TELL NO TALES BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE CONDITIONS AN IMMENSE ADDED STRAIN TO FIND MYSELF ANXIOUS ABOUT HERS
THE STAMP OF PUBLICITY HAD OF COURSE BEEN FULLY GIVEN BY HER CONFINEMENT AND DEPARTURE AND THE CHANGE ITSELF WAS NOW USHERED IN BY OUR NONOBSERVANCE OF THE REGULAR CUSTOM OF THE SCHOOLROOM
AND TO PLEASE THEM--SO LONG AS THEY WERE THERE--OF COURSE I PROMISED
AND I WAS THEREFORE SHAKEN ON THE SPOT BY MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE PARTICULAR ONE FOR WHICH I HAD NOT ALLOWED
I ONLY RECALL THAT WHEN I RE-ENTERED THE HOUSE DARKNESS HAD QUITE CLOSED IN
IF I TELL YOU WHY WILL YOU UNDERSTAND MY HEART AT THIS LEAPED INTO MY MOUTH
THAT WAS THE GREAT REASON WHY THOSE FIENDS TOOK HIM IN SO LONG
I TAKE WHAT YOU SAID TO ME AT NOON AS A DECLARATION THAT YOU'VE NEVER KNOWN HIM TO BE BAD SHE THREW BACK HER HEAD
TELL ME"--OH MY WORK PREOCCUPIED ME AND I WAS OFFHAND!--"IF YESTERDAY AFTERNOON FROM THE TABLE IN THE HALL YOU TOOK YOU KNOW MY LETTER XXIV MY SENSE OF HOW HE RECEIVED THIS SUFFERED FOR A MINUTE FROM SOMETHING THAT I CAN DESCRIBE ONLY AS A FIERCE SPLIT OF MY ATTENTION--A STROKE THAT AT FIRST AS I SPRANG STRAIGHT UP REDUCED ME TO THE MERE BLIND MOVEMENT OF GETTING HOLD OF HIM DRAWING HIM CLOSE AND WHILE I JUST FELL FOR SUPPORT AGAINST THE NEAREST PIECE OF FURNITURE INSTINCTIVELY KEEPING HIM WITH HIS BACK TO THE WINDOW
DID YOU KNOW I MIGHTN'T GO BACK I KNOW EVERYTHING HE GAVE ME AT THIS THE LONGEST AND STRANGEST LOOK
I FELT IN A FIERCE RIGOR OF CONFIDENCE THAT IF I STOOD MY GROUND A MINUTE I SHOULD CEASE--FOR THE TIME AT LEAST--TO HAVE HIM TO RECKON WITH
MY CANDLE UNDER A BOLD FLOURISH WENT OUT AND I PERCEIVED BY THE UNCOVERED WINDOW THAT THE YIELDING DUSK OF EARLIEST MORNING RENDERED IT UNNECESSARY
THE CHILDREN IN ESPECIAL I SHOULD THUS FENCE ABOUT AND ABSOLUTELY SAVE
ONLY LOOK DEAREST WOMAN LOOK SHE LOOKED EVEN AS I DID AND GAVE ME WITH HER DEEP GROAN OF NEGATION REPULSION COMPASSION--THE MIXTURE WITH HER PITY OF HER RELIEF AT HER EXEMPTION--A SENSE TOUCHING TO ME EVEN THEN THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BACKED ME UP IF SHE COULD
AND WHEN THAT FAILED THERE WERE CONFABULATIONS IN CORNERS WITH A SEQUEL OF ONE OF THEM GOING OUT IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS IN ORDER TO COME IN AS SOMETHING NEW
BUT AS I TRACE OVER WHAT WE WENT THROUGH I SEE HOW MUCH COMMON GROUND WE MUST HAVE FOUND IN THE ONE IDEA THAT BY GOOD FORTUNE COULD STEADY US
WHILE I STOOD IN THE PASSAGE I HAD MY EYES ON HER BROTHER'S DOOR WHICH WAS BUT TEN STEPS OFF AND WHICH INDESCRIBABLY PRODUCED IN ME A RENEWAL OF THE STRANGE IMPULSE THAT I LATELY SPOKE OF AS MY TEMPTATION
OF COURSE I'VE LOST YOU
I EVEN PUT HER THE VERY LAST THING OF ALL TO THE TEST
THERE SHE SIGHED WITH TRAGIC RELIEF
SHE HAD LOOKED AT ME IN SWEET SPECULATION AND THEN HAD ACCUSED ME TO MY FACE OF HAVING CRIED I HAD SUPPOSED I HAD BRUSHED AWAY THE UGLY SIGNS
IT ADDED TO THE INTERPOSING CRY AS IF TO STAY THE BLOW THAT MRS GROSE AT THE SAME INSTANT UTTERED OVER MY VIOLENCE--THE SHRIEK OF A CREATURE SCARED OR RATHER WOUNDED WHICH IN TURN WITHIN A FEW SECONDS WAS COMPLETED BY A GASP OF MY OWN
I STILL HELD HER THERE TO SHOW I WAS
THEY GOT THEIR LITTLE TASKS AS IF THEY LOVED THEM AND INDULGED FROM THE MERE EXUBERANCE OF THE GIFT IN THE MOST UNIMPOSED LITTLE MIRACLES OF MEMORY
I RECOGNIZED AS I LOOKED AT THE PAIR OF SHORT THICK OARS QUITE SAFELY DRAWN UP THE PRODIGIOUS CHARACTER OF THE FEAT FOR A LITTLE GIRL
YOU SEE AFTER ALL MISS JESSEL DIDN'T MIND
SHE WAS NOW HOUSEKEEPER AND WAS ALSO ACTING FOR THE TIME AS SUPERINTENDENT TO THE LITTLE GIRL OF WHOM WITHOUT CHILDREN OF HER OWN SHE WAS BY GOOD LUCK EXTREMELY FOND
THEY'VE MADE THEM--THEIR TWO FRIENDS I MEAN--STILL CLEVERER EVEN THAN NATURE DID
SHE WAITED FOR US NOT HERSELF TAKING A STEP AND I WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE RARE SOLEMNITY WITH WHICH WE PRESENTLY APPROACHED HER
WELL--PERHAPS SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE FOUND ME UNEXPECTEDLY CALM
IT WAS PLUMP ONE AFTERNOON IN THE MIDDLE OF MY VERY HOUR
HE HAS RED HAIR VERY RED CLOSE-CURLING AND A PALE FACE LONG IN SHAPE WITH STRAIGHT GOOD FEATURES AND LITTLE RATHER QUEER WHISKERS THAT ARE AS RED AS HIS HAIR
BUT WHAT MISS EVERYTHING
I RECOLLECT COUNTING OVER PERFECTLY THE POSSIBILITIES REMINDING MYSELF THAT NOTHING WAS MORE NATURAL FOR INSTANCE THEN THE APPEARANCE OF ONE OF THE MEN ABOUT THE PLACE OR EVEN OF A MESSENGER A POSTMAN OR A TRADESMAN'S BOY FROM THE VILLAGE
ANOTHER PERSON--THIS TIME
WHAT I'VE SEEN WOULD HAVE MADE YOU SO
BUT THE REAL ACCOUNT I FEEL OF THE HOURS OF PEACE THAT I COULD STILL ENJOY WAS THAT THE IMMEDIATE CHARM OF MY COMPANIONS WAS A BEGUILEMENT STILL EFFECTIVE EVEN UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS STUDIED
SHE TURNED RIGHT AND LEFT IN HER DISTRESS
WHY THE CANDLE'S OUT I THEN CRIED
IF I HAD MET A MURDERER IN SUCH A PLACE AND AT SUCH AN HOUR WE STILL AT LEAST WOULD HAVE SPOKEN
INFERNAL THEN I ALMOST CHEERFULLY REJOINED
THEN HE BECAME AS COMMUNICATIVE AS WE COULD DESIRE AND INDEED GAVE US HIS BEST REASON FOR BEING SO
AS SHE WAS NOWHERE ABOUT SHE WOULD SURELY BE WITH MRS GROSE WHOM IN THE COMFORT OF THAT THEORY I ACCORDINGLY PROCEEDED IN QUEST OF
BUT NONETHELESS BETWEEN MILES AND ME IT'S NOW ALL OUT ALL OUT MY COMPANION STARED
WELL THERE CONTINUED TO BE PLENTY OF CHANCE FOR NERVE
THEY WERE EXTRAORDINARILY AT ONE AND TO SAY THAT THEY NEVER EITHER QUARRELED OR COMPLAINED IS TO MAKE THE NOTE OF PRAISE COARSE FOR THEIR QUALITY OF SWEETNESS
I WAS CONSCIOUS OF A MORTAL COLDNESS AND FELT AS IF I SHOULD NEVER AGAIN BE WARM
PREPARED AND ON HER GUARD AS OUR PURSUIT HAD ACTUALLY MADE HER SHE WOULD REPRESS EVERY BETRAYAL
BUT YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO IT OH YES HE SAID WITH THE BRIGHTEST SUPERFICIAL EAGERNESS YOU WANTED ME TO TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT'S IT
I CALL IT TIME BUT HOW LONG WAS IT
I SEIZED STUPEFIED HIS SUPPOSITION--SOME SEQUEL TO WHAT WE HAD DONE TO FLORA BUT THIS MADE ME ONLY WANT TO SHOW HIM THAT IT WAS BETTER STILL THAN THAT
BUT I OPENED THE DOOR TO FIND AGAIN IN A FLASH MY EYES UNSEALED
BUT I NEVER MET HIM THERE AGAIN
IT WAS DRENCHED
BUT THE SALARY OFFERED MUCH EXCEEDED HER MODEST MEASURE AND ON A SECOND INTERVIEW SHE FACED THE MUSIC SHE ENGAGED AND DOUGLAS WITH THIS MADE A PAUSE THAT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY MOVED ME TO THROW IN THE MORAL OF WHICH WAS OF COURSE THE SEDUCTION EXERCISED BY THE SPLENDID YOUNG MAN
IF SHE HADN'T SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TOLD ME
ON MY HONOR MISS SHE SAYS THINGS BUT AT THIS EVOCATION SHE BROKE DOWN
WHAT I SAW--JUST BEFORE--WAS MUCH WORSE HER HAND TIGHTENED
OF THE POSITIVE IDENTITY OF THE APPARITION I WOULD ASSURE MYSELF AS SOON AS THE SMALL CLOCK OF MY COURAGE SHOULD HAVE TICKED OUT THE RIGHT SECOND
THEY DIDN'T--THEY'VE NEVER TOLD
WELL I NEEDED TO BE REMARKABLE TO OFFER A FRONT TO THE REMARKABLE THINGS THAT PRESENTLY GAVE THEIR FIRST SIGN
SO WHEN HE APPEARED I WAS SITTING IN THE GLOW WITH MY THOUGHTS
SHE PUT OUT HER HAND TO ME AS A PLEDGE
I MEAN--THOUGH THEY GOT THEIR LESSONS BETTER AND BETTER WHICH WAS NATURALLY WHAT WOULD PLEASE HER MOST--IN THE WAY OF DIVERTING ENTERTAINING SURPRISING HER
DON'T GRIN
THEY WERE ATTACHED AT THIS JUNCTURE TO THE STITCHING IN WHICH I WAS ENGAGED AND I CAN FEEL ONCE MORE THE SPASM OF MY EFFORT NOT TO MOVE THEM TILL I SHOULD SO HAVE STEADIED MYSELF AS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHAT TO DO
THEN AFTER ANOTHER EMBRACE THE INCIDENT AND OUR INTERVIEW CLOSED ON MY RECOGNITION OF ALL THE RESERVES OF GOODNESS THAT FOR HIS JOKE HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DRAW UPON
I KNEW WHAT SHE MEANT AND I REPLIED WITH A NEGATIVE HEADSHAKE
I GOT TO THE DOOR WITHOUT HER HEARING ME
THEY PERFORMED THE DIZZIEST FEATS OF ARITHMETIC SOARING QUITE OUT OF MY FEEBLE RANGE AND PERPETRATED IN HIGHER SPIRITS THAN EVER GEOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL JOKES
HERE IT WAS ANOTHER AFFAIR
SHE MAY BE FREE I SEIZED HER ALMOST WITH JOY
YOU LOOK AWFUL I CONSIDERED
IT COMES BACK TO ME THAT I THOUGHT INSTANTLY OF THIS AS SOMETHING I COULD GET FROM HER
IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH AS THE DAY DECLINED I HAD ARRANGED WITH MRS GROSE THAT SHOULD THE EVENING SHOW IMPROVEMENT WE WOULD ATTEND TOGETHER THE LATE SERVICE
SO MONSTROUS WAS I THEN READY TO PRONOUNCE IT THAT SUCH A CHILD AS HAD NOW BEEN REVEALED TO ME SHOULD BE UNDER AN INTERDICT
IT SUITED THEM ALL IT SUITED ME TOO I FELT ONLY TOO WELL
I HAD PERPETUALLY TO GUARD AGAINST THE WONDER OF CONTEMPLATION INTO WHICH MY INITIATED VIEW BETRAYED ME
IT OVERWHELMED ME NOW THAT I SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO BEAR THAT AND IT MADE ME LET MYSELF GO
SO FOR A MOMENT WE REMAINED WHILE I STARED ABOUT ME AND SAW THAT THE DRAWN CURTAINS WERE UNSTIRRED AND THE WINDOW TIGHT
HIDEOUS JUST BECAUSE IT WAS HUMAN AS HUMAN AS TO HAVE MET ALONE IN THE SMALL HOURS IN A SLEEPING HOUSE SOME ENEMY SOME ADVENTURER SOME CRIMINAL
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE THIS DREW FROM ME IN THE STATE OF MY NERVES A FLASH OF IMPATIENCE
DO I SHOW IT YOU'RE AS WHITE AS A SHEET
YET IT APPEARED TO ME THAT WE WERE ALL AT BLY SUFFICIENTLY SACRIFICED TO MAKE THAT VENIAL
BUT I HAVE SINCE LAST EVENING A NEW HOPE
I BURST AS I HAD THE OTHER TIME MADE HER BURST INTO TEARS
WHAT I FELT THE NEXT DAY WAS I SUPPOSE NOTHING THAT COULD BE FAIRLY CALLED A REACTION FROM THE CHEER OF MY ARRIVAL
IT WAS A PLEASURE AT THESE MOMENTS TO FEEL MYSELF TRANQUIL AND JUSTIFIED
YES MAD AS THAT SEEMS THE VERY ACT OF BRINGING IT OUT REALLY HELPED ME TO TRACE IT--FOLLOW IT ALL UP AND PIECE IT ALL TOGETHER
THEY'RE HIS AND THEY'RE HERS QUINT'S AND THAT WOMAN'S QUINT'S AND THAT WOMAN'S
THERE WAS NO AMBIGUITY IN ANYTHING
STILL I MUSED THEY MUST DO FOR THEY MAKE ME FEEL MORE THAN EVER THAT I MUST WATCH IT MADE ME BLUSH THE NEXT MINUTE TO SEE IN MY FRIEND'S FACE HOW MUCH MORE UNRESERVEDLY SHE HAD FORGIVEN HIM THAN HER ANECDOTE STRUCK ME AS PRESENTING TO MY OWN TENDERNESS AN OCCASION FOR DOING
A WOMAN IN BLACK PALE AND DREADFUL--WITH SUCH AN AIR ALSO AND SUCH A FACE!--ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE
TO HIS POOR LITTLE INNOCENT MATES IT'S TOO DREADFUL CRIED MRS GROSE TO SAY SUCH CRUEL THINGS
THE PERSON WAS IN BLACK YOU SAY IN MOURNING--RATHER POOR ALMOST SHABBY
THE CHILDREN I CAN'T LEAVE THEM NOW YOU'RE AFRAID I SPOKE BOLDLY
THERE WERE EMPTY ROOMS AT BLY AND IT WAS ONLY A QUESTION OF CHOOSING THE RIGHT ONE
SHE HAD NEVER TOLD ANYONE
THE MAN
I HAVE YOU I LAUNCHED AT THE BEAST BUT HE HAS LOST YOU FOREVER THEN FOR THE DEMONSTRATION OF MY WORK THERE THERE I SAID TO MILES
OH YES HE NEVERTHELESS REPLIED--"THEY MUST HAVE REPEATED THEM
WHAT DOES HE MATTER NOW MY OWN?--WHAT WILL HE EVER MATTER
SHE HAD ONLY SUPPOSED THAT AFTER THE REPAST I HAD CARRIED OFF BOTH THE CHILDREN
DO I ECHOED SO LOUD THAT MILES AND FLORA AS THEY PASSED AT THEIR DISTANCE PAUSED AN INSTANT IN THEIR WALK AND LOOKED AT US
STRAIGHT TO HER UNCLE ONLY TO TELL ON YOU NO NOT ONLY
I HOPE THEN IT WAS TO MORE PURPOSE THAN IN THIS CASE
I COULD MEET ON THIS WITHOUT SCRUPLE ANY INNOCENCE
I WAS ALREADY ON THE STEPS
WELL I THINK I'M GLAD BLY AGREES WITH ME YOU WOULD CERTAINLY SEEM TO HAVE SEEN THESE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS A GOOD DEAL MORE OF IT THAN FOR SOME TIME BEFORE
AND I THANKED HEAVEN SHE WAS WELL OUT OF THIS YET YOU HAD THEN YOUR IDEA OF HER REAL REASON FOR LEAVING
THEY DON'T KNOW AS YET QUITE HOW--BUT THEY'RE TRYING HARD
AT SCHOOL DID YOU TAKE LETTERS?--OR OTHER THINGS OTHER THINGS HE APPEARED NOW TO BE THINKING OF SOMETHING FAR OFF AND THAT REACHED HIM ONLY THROUGH THE PRESSURE OF HIS ANXIETY
SHE NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN OH SAID THE LADY
BOTH THE CHILDREN HAD A GENTLENESS IT WAS THEIR ONLY FAULT AND IT NEVER MADE MILES A MUFF THAT KEPT THEM--HOW SHALL I EXPRESS IT?--ALMOST IMPERSONAL AND CERTAINLY QUITE UNPUNISHABLE
WONDERFULLY HANDSOME
THE GOLD WAS STILL IN THE SKY THE CLEARNESS IN THE AIR AND THE MAN WHO LOOKED AT ME OVER THE BATTLEMENTS WAS AS DEFINITE AS A PICTURE IN A FRAME
LESSONS WITH ME INDEED THAT CHARMING SUMMER WE ALL HAD A THEORY THAT HE WAS TO HAVE
THEN I RETURNED TO MY ROOM
BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE GUESSED MRS GROSE'S ROUND EYES ENCOUNTERED THIS CHARGE
THEN AT LAST HE PUT INTO TWO WORDS--"DO YOU?"--MORE DISCRIMINATION THAN I HAD EVER HEARD TWO WORDS CONTAIN
SHE DIDN'T KNOW--NO ONE KNEW--HOW PROUD I HAD BEEN TO SERVE HIM AND TO STICK TO OUR TERMS
WOULD HE TELL ME WHY
YET THAT WON'T DO
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THEM THAT ALWAYS MADE ONE CATCH AND I CAUGHT AT ANY RATE NOW SO EFFECTUALLY THAT I STOPPED AS SHORT AS IF ONE OF THE TREES OF THE PARK HAD FALLEN ACROSS THE ROAD
I KEPT THEM MYSELF
MY ATTENTION TO THEM ALL REALLY WENT TO SEEING THEM AMUSE THEMSELVES IMMENSELY WITHOUT ME
IN SPITE OF THIS TIMIDITY--WHICH THE CHILD HERSELF IN THE ODDEST WAY IN THE WORLD HAD BEEN PERFECTLY FRANK AND BRAVE ABOUT ALLOWING IT WITHOUT A SIGN OF UNCOMFORTABLE CONSCIOUSNESS WITH THE DEEP SWEET SERENITY INDEED OF ONE OF RAPHAEL'S HOLY INFANTS TO BE DISCUSSED TO BE IMPUTED TO HER AND TO DETERMINE US--I FEEL QUITE SURE SHE WOULD PRESENTLY LIKE ME
RAISON DE PLUS--AT THAT AGE
BY SEEING HER
BUT IT WAS FOR EACH OTHER WE FEARED
XVII I WENT SO FAR IN THE EVENING AS TO MAKE A BEGINNING
WE HAD LEFT MILES INDOORS ON THE RED CUSHION OF A DEEP WINDOW SEAT
VII I GOT HOLD OF MRS GROSE AS SOON AFTER THIS AS I COULD
THEY WERE AT THIS PERIOD EXTRAVAGANTLY AND PRETERNATURALLY FOND OF ME
THE TEARS WERE AGAIN IN HER EYES
I WANDERED WITH THAT MANNER FOR THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO ALL OVER THE PLACE AND LOOKED I HAVE NO DOUBT AS IF I WERE READY FOR ANY ONSET
IT WAS CONFUSEDLY PRESENT TO ME THAT I OUGHT TO PLACE MYSELF WHERE HE HAD STOOD
AH MISS YOU WRITE WELL--TONIGHT I AT LAST ANSWERED
HE SETTLED TO HIS REPAST WITH THE CHARMING LITTLE TABLE MANNER THAT FROM THE DAY OF HIS ARRIVAL HAD RELIEVED ME OF ALL GROSSNESS OF ADMONITION
OF COURSE I WAS UNDER THE SPELL AND THE WONDERFUL PART IS THAT EVEN AT THE TIME I PERFECTLY KNEW I WAS
I SEE NOBODY
MRS GROSE OF COURSE COULD ONLY GAPE THE WIDER
BUT WHAT HE PRESENTLY PRODUCED WAS
SHE LOOKED INTENSELY GRAVE AND I HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A SENSE OF LOSING AN ADVANTAGE ACQUIRED THE THRILL OF WHICH HAD JUST BEEN SO PRODIGIOUS AS ON MY CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE ADDRESSED ME WITH A REPROACH
IT STRIKES ME THAT BY THIS TIME YOUR EYES ARE OPEN EVEN WIDER THAN MINE THEY PROVED TO BE SO INDEED BUT SHE COULD STILL BLUSH ALMOST TO SHOW IT
IT WAS MY NEW SUSPICION THAT WAS INTOLERABLE
THE LARGE IMPRESSIVE ROOM ONE OF THE BEST IN THE HOUSE THE GREAT STATE BED AS I ALMOST FELT IT THE FULL FIGURED DRAPERIES THE LONG GLASSES IN WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME I COULD SEE MYSELF FROM HEAD TO FOOT ALL STRUCK ME--LIKE THE EXTRAORDINARY CHARM OF MY SMALL CHARGE--AS SO MANY THINGS THROWN IN
SHE HAD NOT GIVEN ME THE SLIP FOR ANY SMALL ADVENTURE AND SINCE THE DAY OF THE VERY GREAT ONE THAT I HAD SHARED WITH HER BY THE POND I HAD BEEN AWARE IN OUR WALKS OF THE QUARTER TO WHICH SHE MOST INCLINED
A GLANCE AT THE WINDOW ENLIGHTENED ME FURTHER AND THE STRIKING OF A MATCH COMPLETED THE PICTURE
MEANWHILE WITH AN EFFORT THAT WAS ALREADY SHARP ENOUGH I TRANSFERRED MY EYES STRAIGHT TO LITTLE FLORA WHO AT THE MOMENT WAS ABOUT TEN YARDS AWAY
QUINT PETER QUINT--HIS OWN MAN HIS VALET WHEN HE WAS HERE WHEN THE MASTER WAS GAPING STILL BUT MEETING ME SHE PIECED IT ALL TOGETHER
THE ROOKS STOPPED CAWING IN THE GOLDEN SKY AND THE FRIENDLY HOUR LOST FOR THE MINUTE ALL ITS VOICE
HE WAS INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL AND MRS GROSE HAD PUT HER FINGER ON IT
AND DID YOU SEE ANYONE AH NO SHE RETURNED ALMOST WITH THE FULL PRIVILEGE OF CHILDISH INCONSEQUENCE RESENTFULLY THOUGH WITH A LONG SWEETNESS IN HER LITTLE DRAWL OF THE NEGATIVE
THE WEATHER HAD CHANGED BACK A GREAT WIND WAS ABROAD AND BENEATH THE LAMP IN MY ROOM WITH FLORA AT PEACE BESIDE ME I SAT FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER AND LISTENED TO THE LASH OF THE RAIN AND THE BATTER OF THE GUSTS
DID YOU FANCY YOU MADE NO NOISE
BUT THESE FANCIES WERE NOT MARKED ENOUGH NOT TO BE THROWN OFF AND IT IS ONLY IN THE LIGHT OR THE GLOOM I SHOULD RATHER SAY OF OTHER AND SUBSEQUENT MATTERS THAT THEY NOW COME BACK TO ME
IT WAS AN ANTIDOTE TO ANY PAIN AND I HAD MORE PAINS THAN ONE
INTENTION TO GET HOLD OF HER MRS GROSE--HER EYES JUST LINGERING ON MINE--GAVE A SHUDDER AND WALKED TO THE WINDOW
THEN DON'T YOU THINK HE CAN BE MADE TO IN WHAT WAY WHY BY HIS COMING DOWN BUT WHO'LL GET HIM TO COME DOWN I WILL THE BOY SAID WITH EXTRAORDINARY BRIGHTNESS AND EMPHASIS
HE REMAINED THERE AWHILE WITH HIS FOREHEAD AGAINST THE GLASS IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE STUPID SHRUBS I KNEW AND THE DULL THINGS OF NOVEMBER
THEN VISIBLY WITH A QUICK BLANKNESS SEEMED TO TRY TO TAKE IT BACK
THOUGH THEY WERE NOT ANGELS THEY PASSED AS THE FRENCH SAY CAUSING ME WHILE THEY STAYED TO TREMBLE WITH THE FEAR OF THEIR ADDRESSING TO THEIR YOUNGER VICTIMS SOME YET MORE INFERNAL MESSAGE OR MORE VIVID IMAGE THAN THEY HAD THOUGHT GOOD ENOUGH FOR MYSELF
THEN WHEN AM I GOING BACK I WORE IN TURNING IT OVER MY MOST RESPONSIBLE AIR
BUT OF WHAT HE NEVER TOLD ME
I MUST HAVE IT NOW
I'VE NEVER LOST IT THEN YOUR MANUSCRIPT IS IN OLD FADED INK AND IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HAND HE HUNG FIRE AGAIN
NOW I MUST GO TO BED
I SCARCE KNOW HOW TO PUT MY STORY INTO WORDS THAT SHALL BE A CREDIBLE PICTURE OF MY STATE OF MIND
BLY HAD CEASED TO AGREE WITH HER
BUT IT WAS IN SIGHT OF NOTHING NOW--MY VISITOR HAD VANISHED
DEAR DEAR--WE MUST KEEP OUR HEADS
DO YOU KNOW YOU'VE NEVER SAID A WORD TO ME ABOUT YOUR SCHOOL--I MEAN THE OLD ONE
I SELECTED MOMENTS WHEN MY ROOMMATE UNMISTAKABLY SLEPT AND STEALING OUT TOOK NOISELESS TURNS IN THE PASSAGE AND EVEN PUSHED AS FAR AS TO WHERE I HAD LAST MET QUINT
IT WAS AN ODD ACCIDENT OF THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED AT SUCH A MOMENT TO BE PARTICULARLY AND VERY GRATEFULLY STRUCK WITH THE OBEDIENCE OF MY LITTLE CHARGES
I WAS NEVER TO TOUCH IT AGAIN
THEN EVER SO GENTLY TO LET ME ALONE HE REPLIED
SHE RESUMED IN A MOMENT AT ANY RATE
THE AUTUMN HAD DROPPED UPON BLY AND HAD BLOWN OUT HALF OUR LIGHTS
WHAT I ON MY SIDE HAD TO CARE FOR WAS WITHOUT DISTURBING HER TO REACH FROM THE CORRIDOR SOME OTHER WINDOW IN THE SAME QUARTER
BUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO YOU I ONLY WENT WITH YOU FOR THE WALK I SAID
AND YET WHAT WELL ARE YOU SO SURE OF THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN I'M NOT SURE OF ANYTHING BUT YOU
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE MUST LEARN AND I STARTED TO WALK FURTHER
HIM AN INJURY THERE WAS SUCH A FLOOD OF GOOD FAITH IN IT THAT THOUGH I HAD NOT YET SEEN THE CHILD MY VERY FEARS MADE ME JUMP TO THE ABSURDITY OF THE IDEA
SOME UNSCRUPULOUS TRAVELER CURIOUS IN OLD HOUSES HAD MADE HIS WAY IN UNOBSERVED ENJOYED THE PROSPECT FROM THE BEST POINT OF VIEW AND THEN STOLEN OUT AS HE CAME
WHAT HAPPENED IT MADE ME THE SOUND OF THE WORDS IN WHICH IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I CAUGHT FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME A SMALL FAINT QUAVER OF CONSENTING CONSCIOUSNESS--IT MADE ME DROP ON MY KNEES BESIDE THE BED AND SEIZE ONCE MORE THE CHANCE OF POSSESSING HIM
WHAT I REMEMBER IS THAT I WAS CONTENT NOT FOR THE TIME TO OPEN THE QUESTION AND THAT CONTENTMENT MUST HAVE SPRUNG FROM THE SENSE OF HIS PERPETUALLY STRIKING SHOW OF CLEVERNESS
WE LIVED IN A CLOUD OF MUSIC AND LOVE AND SUCCESS AND PRIVATE THEATRICALS
NOTHING WAS MORE NATURAL THAN THAT THESE THINGS SHOULD BE THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY WERE NOT
I HAD PLENTY OF ANGUISH AFTER THAT EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT BUT I HAD THANK GOD NO TERROR
SHE'LL BE ABOVE SHE PRESENTLY SAID--"IN ONE OF THE ROOMS YOU HAVEN'T SEARCHED NO
SOMEONE HAD TAKEN A LIBERTY RATHER GROSS
HE'S NOT READING TO HER I DECLARED
I SEE IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING MILES SAID--"I MEAN I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU LIKE
I HAVE IT FROM YOU THEN--FOR IT'S OF GREAT IMPORTANCE--THAT HE WAS DEFINITELY AND ADMITTEDLY BAD OH NOT ADMITTEDLY
DID SHE DIE HERE NO--SHE WENT OFF I DON'T KNOW WHAT THERE WAS IN THIS BREVITY OF MRS GROSE'S THAT STRUCK ME AS AMBIGUOUS
I HAD OFTEN ADMIRED IT AND I KNEW MY WAY ABOUT IN IT
ON THE REMOVAL OF THE TEA THINGS I HAD BLOWN OUT THE CANDLES AND DRAWN MY CHAIR CLOSER
PROOFS I SAY YES--FROM THE MOMENT I REALLY TOOK HOLD
THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER WHEN I FOUND MYSELF JUST CONSCIOUSLY STARTING AS AT THE PASSAGE BEFORE MY DOOR OF A LIGHT FOOTSTEP
THE SUNDAY STILLNESS BOTH OF THE APPROACHES AND OF THE INTERIOR IN WHICH I MET NO ONE FAIRLY EXCITED ME WITH A SENSE OF OPPORTUNITY
HOW CAN POOR MISS JESSEL--WHEN POOR MISS JESSEL'S DEAD AND BURIED
FLORA HAS NOW HER GRIEVANCE AND SHE'LL WORK IT TO THE END YES MISS
I WENT STRAIGHT TO MY ROOM BUT HIS SISTER WAS NOT THERE
WHAT IS IT I ASKED THAT YOU THINK OF WHAT IN THE WORLD MY DEAR BUT YOU AH THE PRIDE I TAKE IN YOUR APPRECIATION DOESN'T INSIST ON THAT
I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PROMPTED BY STRESS OF NEED BY DESPERATION OF MIND--I SCARCE KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT--TO INVOKE SUCH FURTHER AID TO INTELLIGENCE AS MIGHT SPRING FROM PUSHING MY COLLEAGUE FAIRLY TO THE WALL
SHE SENT ME THE PAGES IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED THEY WERE ALL LISTENING NOW AND OF COURSE THERE WAS SOMEBODY TO BE ARCH OR AT ANY RATE TO DRAW THE INFERENCE
SOMETHING WOULD HAVE PASSED IN LIFE BETWEEN US
NOT THERE IF I DIDN'T SEE HIM
BUT THERE WAS EVERYTHING FOR OUR APPREHENSION IN THE LUCKY FACT THAT NO DISCOMFORTABLE LEGEND NO PERTURBATION OF SCULLIONS HAD EVER WITHIN ANYONE'S MEMORY ATTACHED TO THE KIND OLD PLACE
I SEEMED AT ANY RATE FOR AN INSTANT TO SEE THEIR EVOCATION OF HER AS DISTINCTLY AS I HAD SEEN HER BY THE POND
WHAT A DREADFUL TURN TO BE SURE MISS
WHAT IT WAS MOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RID OF WAS THE CRUEL IDEA THAT WHATEVER I HAD SEEN MILES AND FLORA SAW MORE--THINGS TERRIBLE AND UNGUESSABLE AND THAT SPRANG FROM DREADFUL PASSAGES OF INTERCOURSE IN THE PAST
SHE WAS THERE FOR POOR SCARED MRS GROSE BUT SHE WAS THERE MOST FOR FLORA
I WAITED BUT NOTHING CAME
SHE ONLY MIGHT HAVE BECOME SO IF SHE HAD STAYED
SHE ISN'T THERE LITTLE LADY AND NOBODY'S THERE--AND YOU NEVER SEE NOTHING MY SWEET
I'LL GO--I'LL GO
AND THESE THINGS CAME ROUND TO THE MASTERS
I SEEMED LITERALLY TO BE RUNNING A RACE WITH SOME CONFUSION TO WHICH HE WAS ABOUT TO REDUCE ME BUT I FELT THAT HE HAD GOT IN FIRST WHEN BEFORE WE HAD EVEN ENTERED THE CHURCHYARD HE THREW OUT I WANT MY OWN SORT IT LITERALLY MADE ME BOUND FORWARD
OH NO NOT NEARLY
BUT MIND YOU DON'T REPORT
YOU STAY ON JUST FOR THAT CERTAINLY
I FIGURED TO MYSELF WHAT MIGHT PORTENTOUSLY BE
AND NOTHING ELSE PERHAPS WHEN I THOUGHT OF SUCH OCCASIONS AFTERWARD GAVE ME SO THE SUSPICION OF BEING WATCHED FROM UNDER COVER
SHE KEPT IT TO HERSELF
I RECOGNIZED THE SIGNS THE PORTENTS--I RECOGNIZED THE MOMENT THE SPOT
MISS JESSEL HAD WITH A MOST STRANGE MANNER REQUESTED HER TO MIND HER BUSINESS AND THE GOOD WOMAN HAD ON THIS DIRECTLY APPROACHED LITTLE MILES
IN THE PRESENCE OF WHAT I SAW I REELED STRAIGHT BACK UPON MY RESISTANCE
VERY LIKELY
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE
ON REACHING THE HOUSE I HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS LOOKED FOR THE BOY
I FELT THAT THE CAUSE WAS MINE AND THAT I SHOULD SURELY GET ALL
MY COMPANION STILL DEMURRED
I DO BELIEVE THAT--POOR LITTLE EXQUISITE WRETCH!--HE WANTS TO SPEAK
YOU MUST TAKE FLORA MY VISITOR AT THIS DID SPECULATE
NO EVENING I HAD PASSED AT BLY HAD THE PORTENTOUS QUALITY OF THIS ONE
BUT WHEN TEN MINUTES LATER AND IN PURSUANCE OF OUR ARRANGEMENT WE MET IN THE HALL IT WAS ONLY TO REPORT ON EITHER SIDE THAT AFTER GUARDED INQUIRIES WE HAD ALTOGETHER FAILED TO TRACE HER
OH YES--AS TO THAT
I MET HIS KISS AND I HAD TO MAKE WHILE I FOLDED HIM FOR A MINUTE IN MY ARMS THE MOST STUPENDOUS EFFORT NOT TO CRY
I SAT UP AND READ AND WHEN DID YOU GO DOWN AT MIDNIGHT
AH BUT I WILL I WILL
COME THERE WAS SOMETHING BETWEEN THEM THERE WAS EVERYTHING IN SPITE OF THE DIFFERENCE OH OF THEIR RANK THEIR CONDITION"--SHE BROUGHT IT WOEFULLY OUT
AND ALWAYS WITH THE SAME LADY I RETURNED
THERE WAS NO ONE TO STOP ME
WE WERE CUT OFF REALLY TOGETHER
IT WAS EXACTLY AS IF THEY HAD BOTH HAD AT HEART TO GLOSS OVER ANY RECENT LITTLE FRICTION
SHE SAID OH OF COURSE OF COURSE!'--AND I SAID THE SAME I THOUGHT A MOMENT
BUT IT WAS ALL DONE IN A SILENCE BY THIS TIME FLAGRANTLY OMINOUS
IT REPRESENTS BUT GROSSLY WHAT TOOK PLACE WITHIN ME AT THE SIGHT TO SAY THAT ON THE SECOND MY DECISION WAS MADE
BUT I ONLY KNOW CLEARLY THAT THEY'RE RATHER SMALL AND VERY FIXED
I DON'T LIKE YOU THEN AFTER THIS DELIVERANCE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT OF A VULGARLY PERT LITTLE GIRL IN THE STREET SHE HUGGED MRS GROSE MORE CLOSELY AND BURIED IN HER SKIRTS THE DREADFUL LITTLE FACE
TAKE ME AWAY TAKE ME AWAY--OH TAKE ME AWAY FROM HER FROM ME I PANTED
HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE ELSE YOU SAY--SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT YOU HE WAS LOOKING FOR LITTLE MILES A PORTENTOUS CLEARNESS NOW POSSESSED ME
THEN ASK FLORA--SHE'S SURE BUT I HAD NO SOONER SPOKEN THAN I CAUGHT MYSELF UP
THE TERRACE AND THE WHOLE PLACE THE LAWN AND THE GARDEN BEYOND IT ALL I COULD SEE OF THE PARK WERE EMPTY WITH A GREAT EMPTINESS
AWAY EVEN MOST OF ALL NOW FROM ME
OH NEVER KNOWN HIM--I DON'T PRETEND THAT I WAS UPSET AGAIN
BUT I WAS IN THESE DAYS LITERALLY ABLE TO FIND A JOY IN THE EXTRAORDINARY FLIGHT OF HEROISM THE OCCASION DEMANDED OF ME
I NOW SAW THAT I HAD BEEN ASKED FOR A SERVICE ADMIRABLE AND DIFFICULT
WENT WHERE HER EXPRESSION AT THIS BECAME EXTRAORDINARY
BUT HORRIBLE AS IT WAS HIS LIES MADE UP MY TRUTH
AS I'M NOT A FIEND AT ANY RATE I SHOULDN'T TAKE HIM IN MY COMPANION AFTER AN INSTANT AND FOR ALL ANSWER SAT DOWN AGAIN AND GRASPED MY ARM
BUT I DID COME
HE TURNED AWAY
BUT THERE HAD BEEN MATTERS IN HIS LIFE--STRANGE PASSAGES AND PERILS SECRET DISORDERS VICES MORE THAN SUSPECTED--THAT WOULD HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR A GOOD DEAL MORE
WHEN I PUT THE QUESTION TO MILES HE PLAYED ON A MINUTE BEFORE ANSWERING AND THEN COULD ONLY SAY
HE SMILED WITH THE SAME LOVELINESS
I SAY YOU THERE--COME IN IT WAS A GAIETY IN THE GLOOM
YOU CAME FOR ME FOR CHURCH OF COURSE BUT I CAN'T GO HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED YES
YOU'LL RECEIVE THE PACKET THURSDAY MORNING I INQUIRED
IT WAS AT LEAST CHANGE AND IT CAME WITH A RUSH
NO I CAN'T SAY THAT MILES EXCEPT JUST THAT ONE NIGHT YOU KNOW THAT ONE NIGHT I COULDN'T LOOK AS STRAIGHT AS HE
IT WAS A CRISP CLEAR DAY THE FIRST OF ITS ORDER FOR SOME TIME
BUT IN SPITE OF--OR PERHAPS JUST ON ACCOUNT OF--THE EVENTUAL DIFFUSION OF THIS KNOWLEDGE WE QUITE LET HIM ALONE TILL AFTER DINNER TILL SUCH AN HOUR OF THE EVENING IN FACT AS MIGHT BEST ACCORD WITH THE KIND OF EMOTION ON WHICH OUR HOPES WERE FIXED
WE MUST FIND THEM MY HAND WAS ON MY FRIEND'S ARM BUT SHE FAILED FOR THE MOMENT CONFRONTED WITH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER TO RESPOND TO MY PRESSURE
AS I'VE TOLD YOU HOWEVER IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE YOU'VE MADE UP YOUR MIND
BUT MY COMPANION WITH LESS IMAGINATION KEPT ME UP
BUT IF MY PUPILS PRACTICED UPON ME IT WAS SURELY WITH THE MINIMUM OF GROSSNESS
I SLEPT IMMEDIATELY AND AS I AFTERWARD KNEW TILL ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK
WITH A KIND OF FURY OF INTENTION I MADE HER TURN PALE
WHAT IF HE SHOULD SEE HIM LITTLE MILES
MRS GROSE WATCHED THEM WITH POSITIVE PLACIDITY
I HAD BEEN THERE BUT AN INSTANT HOWEVER WHEN SHE VANISHED WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND AT ME
HE NEITHER BLANCHED NOR WINKED
MY PRESENT QUICKENED COURAGE HOWEVER WAS SUCH THAT NOT TOO MUCH TO LET IT THROUGH I HAD TO SHADE AS IT WERE MY FLAME
IS HE UNTIDY
YES HE DO HATE WORRY
AS TO WHICH SHE WAS QUITE IN HER RIGHT FOR IT WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME I HAD ALLOWED THE LITTLE GIRL OUT OF MY SIGHT WITHOUT SOME SPECIAL PROVISION
FACING THE FLAME FROM HER STRAIGHT CHAIR IN THE DUSKY SHINING ROOM A LARGE CLEAN IMAGE OF THE PUT AWAY"--OF DRAWERS CLOSED AND LOCKED AND REST WITHOUT A REMEDY
I ONLY KNOW THAT THE NEXT INSTANT I HEARD MYSELF THROW OFF WITH HOMELY FORCE
HE WAS TERRIBLY SHORT WITH ANYTHING OF THAT KIND AND IF PEOPLE WERE ALL RIGHT TO HIM HE WOULDN'T BE BOTHERED WITH MORE THIS SQUARED WELL ENOUGH WITH MY IMPRESSIONS OF HIM
THE EXCLAMATION WAS HOMELY BUT IT REVEALED A REAL ACCEPTANCE OF MY FURTHER PROOF OF WHAT IN THE BAD TIME--FOR THERE HAD BEEN A WORSE EVEN THAN THIS!--MUST HAVE OCCURRED
TO ME I HAD A SUDDEN FEAR OF WHAT SHE MIGHT DO
IT WAS PART OF WHAT I ALREADY LIKED MRS GROSE HERSELF FOR THE PLEASURE I COULD SEE HER FEEL IN MY ADMIRATION AND WONDER AS I SAT AT SUPPER WITH FOUR TALL CANDLES AND WITH MY PUPIL IN A HIGH CHAIR AND A BIB BRIGHTLY FACING ME BETWEEN THEM OVER BREAD AND MILK
THE FACT THAT THE DAYS PASSED FOR ME WITHOUT ANOTHER ENCOUNTER OUGHT IT WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING TOWARD SOOTHING MY NERVES
SHE THREW HERSELF ON HER KNEES AND DRAWING THE CHILD TO HER BREAST CLASPED IN A LONG EMBRACE THE LITTLE TENDER YIELDING BODY
IT LITTLE MATTERS FOR RELIEF ARRIVED
THERE WERE HOURS FROM DAY TO DAY--OR AT LEAST THERE WERE MOMENTS SNATCHED EVEN FROM CLEAR DUTIES--WHEN I HAD TO SHUT MYSELF UP TO THINK
YOU MEAN THE CRUEL CHARGE IT DOESN'T LIVE AN INSTANT
I DID PUT MY FOOT IN IT
HE DENIED SHE REPEATED
HE DID WHAT HE WISHED WITH HER WITH THEM ALL IT WAS AS IF NOW IN MY FRIEND'S OWN EYES MISS JESSEL HAD AGAIN APPEARED
THERE APPEARS TO ME MOREOVER AS I LOOK BACK NO NOTE IN ALL THIS MORE EXTRAORDINARY THAN THE MERE FACT THAT IN SPITE OF MY TENSION AND OF THEIR TRIUMPH I NEVER LOST PATIENCE WITH THEM
I WAS SO SLOW TO FIND ANYTHING THAT HE HAD PLENTY OF TIME AFTER A MINUTE TO CONTINUE WITH HIS SUGGESTIVE BUT INCONCLUSIVE SMILE
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE TO FRIGHTEN YOU BUT IF I HAD BY YOUR IDEA GONE OUT SHE ABSOLUTELY DECLINED TO BE PUZZLED
IT DIDN'T LAST AS SUSPENSE--IT WAS SUPERSEDED BY HORRIBLE PROOFS
BUT COME SHE HAD HELPLESSLY GLOOMED AT THE UPPER REGIONS
WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE HE GAZED UP AT ME AGAIN
HE STOLE LETTERS SHE COULDN'T KNOW MY REASONS FOR A CALMNESS AFTER ALL PRETTY SHALLOW
I ONLY SAT THERE ON MY TOMB AND READ INTO WHAT MY LITTLE FRIEND HAD SAID TO ME THE FULLNESS OF ITS MEANING
EVEN MRS GROSE LOOKED ACROSS AT ME DISMAYED WHILE I HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT COMMUNICATE AGAIN WITH THE FIGURE THAT ON THE OPPOSITE BANK WITHOUT A MOVEMENT AS RIGIDLY STILL AS IF CATCHING BEYOND THE INTERVAL OUR VOICES WAS AS VIVIDLY THERE FOR MY DISASTER AS IT WAS NOT THERE FOR MY SERVICE
I LEARNED SOMETHING--AT FIRST CERTAINLY--THAT HAD NOT BEEN ONE OF THE TEACHINGS OF MY SMALL SMOTHERED LIFE
WELL WHAT MRS GROSE'S SUSPENSE BLAZED AT ME BUT IT WAS TOO LATE NOW AND I BROUGHT THE THING OUT HANDSOMELY
SHE PASSED THAT NIGHT BY THE MOST TACIT AND I SHOULD ADD WERE NOT THE WORD SO GROTESQUE A FALSE NOTE THE HAPPIEST OF ARRANGEMENTS WITH MRS GROSE
HE PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS EYES MADE A LITTLE WINCING GRIMACE
SHE HAS TOLD YOU SHE PANTED
THEY'VE SUCCESSFULLY WORKED THEIR PLAN
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?"--INSTEAD OF CHALLENGING HER OWN IRREGULARITY I FOUND MYSELF ARRAIGNED AND EXPLAINING
WASN'T THERE LIGHT IN THE FACT WHICH AS WE SHARED OUR SOLITUDE BROKE OUT WITH A SPECIOUS GLITTER IT HAD NEVER YET QUITE WORN?--THE FACT THAT OPPORTUNITY AIDING PRECIOUS OPPORTUNITY WHICH HAD NOW COME IT WOULD BE PREPOSTEROUS WITH A CHILD SO ENDOWED TO FOREGO THE HELP ONE MIGHT WREST FROM ABSOLUTE INTELLIGENCE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY MORE TIME WELL A DAY OR TWO--REALLY TO BRING IT OUT
YOU'VE THE CLEVEREST LITTLE PERSON TO DEAL WITH
AND WE HAD ALL THREE WITH REPETITION GOT INTO SUCH SPLENDID TRAINING THAT WE WENT EACH TIME ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY TO MARK THE CLOSE OF THE INCIDENT THROUGH THE VERY SAME MOVEMENTS
AGITATION IN THE INTERVAL CERTAINLY HAD HELD ME AND DRIVEN ME FOR I MUST IN CIRCLING ABOUT THE PLACE HAVE WALKED THREE MILES
WITH THE STROKE OF THE LOSS I WAS SO PROUD OF HE UTTERED THE CRY OF A CREATURE HURLED OVER AN ABYSS AND THE GRASP WITH WHICH I RECOVERED HIM MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT OF CATCHING HIM IN HIS FALL
WELL--SO WE'RE ALONE XXIII OH MORE OR LESS I FANCY MY SMILE WAS PALE
THERE HAD BEEN A MOMENT WHEN I BELIEVED I RECOGNIZED FAINT AND FAR THE CRY OF A CHILD
AND HOW MUCH WILL YOU MILES HAVE TO TELL HIM
YOUR LETTER WON'T HAVE GOT THERE
DEAR LITTLE MILES DEAR LITTLE MILES MY FACE WAS CLOSE TO HIS AND HE LET ME KISS HIM SIMPLY TAKING IT WITH INDULGENT GOOD HUMOR
YES I HAD THE SHARPEST SENSE THAT DURING THIS TRANSIT HE NEVER TOOK HIS EYES FROM ME AND I CAN SEE AT THIS MOMENT THE WAY HIS HAND AS HE WENT PASSED FROM ONE OF THE CRENELATIONS TO THE NEXT
BUT I COULD SO LITTLE FACE THE UGLINESS AND THE PAIN OF IT THAT I SIMPLY PROCRASTINATED AND LIVED FROM HAND TO MOUTH
OH YES HE ANSWERED VERY SIMPLY
BUT I CAN'T BEGIN TO EXPRESS THE EFFECT UPON ME OF AN IMPLICATION OF SURRENDER EVEN SO FAINT
OF WHAT OTHER THINGS HAVE YOU GOT HOLD WHY OF THE VERY THINGS THAT HAVE DELIGHTED FASCINATED AND YET AT BOTTOM AS I NOW SO STRANGELY SEE MYSTIFIED AND TROUBLED ME
IF I'VE BEEN OBLIGED TO LEAVE HER THREE OR FOUR TIMES IT HAS BEEN EACH TIME WITH ONE OF THE MAIDS AND AT PRESENT THOUGH SHE'S ALONE SHE'S LOCKED IN SAFE
THEN YOU HAVE KNOWN HIM YES INDEED MISS THANK GOD ON REFLECTION I ACCEPTED THIS
I DID THIS TO SUCH PURPOSE THAT I MADE SURE THEY HAD IN SOME WAY BRIBED HER TO SILENCE
I SOMEHOW MADE OUT IN IT THE DELAYED DAWN OF AN IDEA I MYSELF HAD NOT GIVEN HER AND THAT WAS AS YET QUITE OBSCURE TO ME
SOMETHING HOWEVER HAPPENED THIS TIME THAT HAD NOT HAPPENED BEFORE
THAT'S HOW I THOUGHT WITH EXTRAORDINARY QUICKNESS OF EACH PERSON THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND THAT HE WAS NOT
ONE EVENING--WITH NOTHING TO LEAD UP OR TO PREPARE IT--I FELT THE COLD TOUCH OF THE IMPRESSION THAT HAD BREATHED ON ME THE NIGHT OF MY ARRIVAL AND WHICH MUCH LIGHTER THEN AS I HAVE MENTIONED I SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE MADE LITTLE OF IN MEMORY HAD MY SUBSEQUENT SOJOURN BEEN LESS AGITATED
READING HER PASSAGES TELLING HER STORIES ACTING HER CHARADES POUNCING OUT AT HER IN DISGUISES AS ANIMALS AND HISTORICAL CHARACTERS AND ABOVE ALL ASTONISHING HER BY THE PIECES THEY HAD SECRETLY GOT BY HEART AND COULD INTERMINABLY RECITE
THERE WAS BUT ONE SANE INFERENCE
BUT THERE WAS NO OTHER CHANGE IN NATURE UNLESS INDEED IT WERE A CHANGE THAT I SAW WITH A STRANGER SHARPNESS
HE STOPPED AT THE OTHER CORNER BUT LESS LONG AND EVEN AS HE TURNED AWAY STILL MARKEDLY FIXED ME
BUT THAT ONLY MADE HIS LITTLE FINAL AUDITORY MORE COMPACT AND SELECT KEPT IT ROUND THE HEARTH SUBJECT TO A COMMON THRILL
SO SHE DISTURBED YOU AND TO SEE WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT YOU ALSO LOOKED--YOU SAW WHILE YOU I CONCURRED CAUGHT YOUR DEATH IN THE NIGHT AIR HE LITERALLY BLOOMED SO FROM THIS EXPLOIT THAT HE COULD AFFORD RADIANTLY TO ASSENT
WHAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR MIND YOU KNOW AH THEN IS THAT WHAT YOU'VE STAYED OVER FOR HE SPOKE WITH A GAIETY THROUGH WHICH I COULD STILL CATCH THE FINEST LITTLE QUIVER OF RESENTFUL PASSION
QUINT WAS SO CLEVER--HE WAS SO DEEP I TOOK THIS IN STILL MORE THAN PROBABLY I SHOWED
I'VE TOLD YOU--I TOLD YOU THIS MORNING OH I WAS SORRY FOR HIM
IT WAS STRIKING OF THE CHILDREN AT ALL EVENTS TO KISS ME INVETERATELY WITH A KIND OF WILD IRRELEVANCE AND NEVER TO FAIL--ONE OR THE OTHER--OF THE PRECIOUS QUESTION THAT HAD HELPED US THROUGH MANY A PERIL
I TURNED AWAY
I GO ON I KNOW AS IF I WERE CRAZY
NO THEN NOBODY ABOUT THE PLACE
I REMEMBER IN FACT THAT AS WE PUSHED INTO HIS LITTLE CHAMBER WHERE THE BED HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT IN AT ALL AND THE WINDOW UNCOVERED TO THE MOONLIGHT MADE THE PLACE SO CLEAR THAT THERE WAS NO NEED OF STRIKING A MATCH--I REMEMBER HOW I SUDDENLY DROPPED SANK UPON THE EDGE OF THE BED FROM THE FORCE OF THE IDEA THAT HE MUST KNOW HOW HE REALLY AS THEY SAY HAD ME
ON THE SPOT ACCORDINGLY IN THE PLEASANT HALL AND WITH HER EYES ON ME I FOR A REASON THAT I COULDN'T THEN HAVE PHRASED ACHIEVED AN INWARD RESOLUTION--OFFERED A VAGUE PRETEXT FOR MY LATENESS AND WITH THE PLEA OF THE BEAUTY OF THE NIGHT AND OF THE HEAVY DEW AND WET FEET WENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO MY ROOM
I GOT SO FAR AS THE IMMEDIATE MOMENT WAS CONCERNED AWAY
NO NO
NO NO
SHE'S SO HORRIBLE I SAW MY COLLEAGUE SCARCE KNEW HOW TO PUT IT
IF SO MUCH HAD SPRUNG TO THE SURFACE I SCARCE PUT IT TOO STRONGLY IN SAYING THAT WHAT HAD PERHAPS SPRUNG HIGHEST WAS THE ABSURDITY OF OUR PROLONGING THE FICTION THAT I HAD ANYTHING MORE TO TEACH HIM
I HAVE KEPT TO THIS DAY THE HEARTBREAKING LITTLE IDEA OF HOW HE SEEMED TO KNOW THAT AND TO PLAY WITH IT
WELL THIS MATTER OF MINE THINK WHAT YOU WILL OF IT LASTED WHILE I CAUGHT AT A DOZEN POSSIBILITIES NONE OF WHICH MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE BETTER THAT I COULD SEE IN THERE HAVING BEEN IN THE HOUSE--AND FOR HOW LONG ABOVE ALL?--A PERSON OF WHOM I WAS IN IGNORANCE
BUT AFTER GASPING AN INSTANT AT MY SUDDEN RESIGNATION BECAUSE OF YOUR LETTER SHE EAGERLY BROUGHT OUT
THE TRUTH THAT WHETHER THE CHILDREN REALLY SAW OR NOT--SINCE THAT IS IT WAS NOT YET DEFINITELY PROVED--I GREATLY PREFERRED AS A SAFEGUARD THE FULLNESS OF MY OWN EXPOSURE
XII THE PARTICULAR IMPRESSION I HAD RECEIVED PROVED IN THE MORNING LIGHT I REPEAT NOT QUITE SUCCESSFULLY PRESENTABLE TO MRS GROSE THOUGH I REINFORCED IT WITH THE MENTION OF STILL ANOTHER REMARK THAT HE HAD MADE BEFORE WE SEPARATED
MR QUINT IS DEAD VI IT TOOK OF COURSE MORE THAN THAT PARTICULAR PASSAGE TO PLACE US TOGETHER IN PRESENCE OF WHAT WE HAD NOW TO LIVE WITH AS WE COULD--MY DREADFUL LIABILITY TO IMPRESSIONS OF THE ORDER SO VIVIDLY EXEMPLIFIED AND MY COMPANION'S KNOWLEDGE HENCEFORTH--A KNOWLEDGE HALF CONSTERNATION AND HALF COMPASSION--OF THAT LIABILITY
SHE BELIEVED ME I WAS SURE ABSOLUTELY
IT SUFFICIENTLY STUCK OUT THAT BY TACIT LITTLE TRICKS IN WHICH EVEN MORE THAN MYSELF HE CARRIED OUT THE CARE FOR MY DIGNITY I HAD HAD TO APPEAL TO HIM TO LET ME OFF STRAINING TO MEET HIM ON THE GROUND OF HIS TRUE CAPACITY
AND WE LIVED IN MUCH PROFUSION OF THEORY THAT HE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT ARRIVE TO MINGLE IN OUR CIRCLE
IF I COULD IMMEDIATELY HAVE SUCCUMBED TO IT I MIGHT HAVE SPARED MYSELF--WELL YOU'LL SEE WHAT
BUT I TURNED IT OVER
THEN HE WAS BEFORE ME AGAIN WITH THE AIR OF A PERSON FOR WHOM OUTSIDE SOMEONE WHO HAD FRANKLY TO BE RECKONED WITH WAS WAITING
SO THAT MY TIME WAS TAKEN ONLY WITH BEING FOR THEM SOME REMARKABLE PERSON OR THING THAT THE GAME OF THE MOMENT REQUIRED AND THAT WAS MERELY THANKS TO MY SUPERIOR MY EXALTED STAMP A HAPPY AND HIGHLY DISTINGUISHED SINECURE
THERE WAS A WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT AND I DEALT
WHAT FLORA WANTS OF COURSE IS TO GET RID OF ME MY COMPANION BRAVELY CONCURRED
THE FELLOW WAS A HOUND MRS GROSE CONSIDERED AS IF IT WERE PERHAPS A LITTLE A CASE FOR A SENSE OF SHADES
IT WAS THROWN IN AS WELL FROM THE FIRST MOMENT THAT I SHOULD GET ON WITH MRS GROSE IN A RELATION OVER WHICH ON MY WAY IN THE COACH I FEAR I HAD RATHER BROODED
IF YOU THINK WELL OF THIS ONE!"--AND SHE STOOD THERE WITH A PLATE IN HER HAND BEAMING AT OUR COMPANION WHO LOOKED FROM ONE OF US TO THE OTHER WITH PLACID HEAVENLY EYES THAT CONTAINED NOTHING TO CHECK US
A VERY FEW OF THEM IN FACT PASSING IN CONSTANT SIGHT OF MY PUPILS WITHOUT A FRESH INCIDENT SUFFICED TO GIVE TO GRIEVOUS FANCIES AND EVEN TO ODIOUS MEMORIES A KIND OF BRUSH OF THE SPONGE
ON LEAVING HER AFTER MY FIRST OUTBREAK I HAD OF COURSE RETURNED TO MY PUPILS ASSOCIATING THE RIGHT REMEDY FOR MY DISMAY WITH THAT SENSE OF THEIR CHARM WHICH I HAD ALREADY FOUND TO BE A THING I COULD POSITIVELY CULTIVATE AND WHICH HAD NEVER FAILED ME YET
THERE WAS A MOMENT DURING WHICH I LISTENED REMINDED OF THE FAINT SENSE I HAD HAD THE FIRST NIGHT OF THERE BEING SOMETHING UNDEFINABLY ASTIR IN THE HOUSE AND NOTED THE SOFT BREATH OF THE OPEN CASEMENT JUST MOVE THE HALF-DRAWN BLIND
THAT'S WHY I ASK YOU HE TURNED TO ME AGAIN HIS LITTLE BEAUTIFUL FEVERED FACE
AT THIS SAME HOUR ALMOST AT DARK SAID MRS GROSE
I DON'T REMEMBER THEIR NAMES WERE THEY THEN SO MANY NO--ONLY A FEW
OH THANK GOD SHE SPRANG UP AGAIN AT THIS DRYING HER EYES WITH A GROAN
HE WAITED HE CALLED FOR GUIDANCE
TO WRITE HOME I CAN'T NAME THE EXQUISITE PATHOS OF THE CONTRADICTION GIVEN TO SUCH A SPEECH BY SUCH A SPEAKER
YOU SEE ME ASKING HIM FOR A VISIT NO WITH HER EYES ON MY FACE SHE EVIDENTLY COULDN'T
THEY'RE IN THE SCHOOLROOM LORD MISS MY VIEW I WAS MYSELF AWARE--AND THEREFORE I SUPPOSE MY TONE--HAD NEVER YET REACHED SO CALM AN ASSURANCE
THE STORM OF THE NIGHT AND THE EARLY MORNING HAD DROPPED BUT THE AFTERNOON WAS DAMP AND GRAY
WHAT WAS HE DOING ON THE TOWER ONLY STANDING THERE AND LOOKING DOWN AT ME SHE THOUGHT A MINUTE
I NODDED AT THE HOUSE
AND SO IN THE COLD FAINT TWILIGHT WITH A GLIMMER IN THE HIGH GLASS AND ANOTHER ON THE POLISH OF THE OAK STAIR BELOW WE FACED EACH OTHER IN OUR COMMON INTENSITY
OF COURSE WE HAVE THE OTHERS WE HAVE THE OTHERS--WE HAVE INDEED THE OTHERS I CONCURRED
OH YES
I COULD GIVE THE WHOLE THING UP--TURN MY BACK AND RETREAT
OH IT WAS QUITE SETTLED THAT SHE MUST SHARE
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW MY FRIEND ADDED I TOOK IT FROM HER BY THE LAKE THAT JUST THEN AND THERE AT LEAST THERE WAS NOBODY RATHER
SO FOR A LITTLE WE FACED IT ONCE MORE TOGETHER
WAS IT TO EVERYONE I ASKED
THERE WAS A DISTINCTION ALL HIS OWN IN EVERY IMPULSE HE REVEALED
HE WAS NOT A TROUBLE-LOVING GENTLEMAN NOR SO VERY PARTICULAR PERHAPS ABOUT SOME OF THE COMPANY HE KEPT
BUT HEAVENS I FELL WITH VEHEMENCE ATHINKING WHAT IT SHOWS THAT THEY MUST TO THAT EXTENT HAVE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING OF HIM AH NOTHING THAT'S NOT NICE NOW MRS GROSE LUGUBRIOUSLY PLEADED
SHE NEVER TOLD ME I HAD A SCRUPLE BUT I OVERCAME IT
I WONDERED EVEN THEN A LITTLE WHY SHE SHOULD WISH NOT TO SHOW IT AND THAT WITH REFLECTION WITH SUSPICION MIGHT OF COURSE HAVE MADE ME UNEASY
AND IF HE WAS SO BAD THEN AS THAT COMES TO HOW IS HE SUCH AN ANGEL NOW YES INDEED--AND IF HE WAS A FIEND AT SCHOOL
BUT THAT WAS NOT THE WONDER OF WONDERS
THE MOON MADE THE NIGHT EXTRAORDINARILY PENETRABLE AND SHOWED ME ON THE LAWN A PERSON DIMINISHED BY DISTANCE WHO STOOD THERE MOTIONLESS AND AS IF FASCINATED LOOKING UP TO WHERE I HAD APPEARED--LOOKING THAT IS NOT SO MUCH STRAIGHT AT ME AS AT SOMETHING THAT WAS APPARENTLY ABOVE ME
WHAT SURPASSED EVERYTHING WAS THAT THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY IN THE WORLD WHO COULD HAVE FOR THE INFERIOR AGE SEX AND INTELLIGENCE SO FINE A CONSIDERATION
YET IT WAS NOT AT SUCH AN ELEVATION THAT THE FIGURE I HAD SO OFTEN INVOKED SEEMED MOST IN PLACE
GOOD NIGHT AND QUICKLY CATCHING UP A CANDLESTICK HE LEFT US SLIGHTLY BEWILDERED
NO DOUBT THOUGH HIS INDIFFERENCE MUST HAVE BEEN AWFUL
THERE WAS A QUEER RELIEF AT ALL EVENTS--I MEAN FOR MYSELF IN ESPECIAL--IN THE RENOUNCEMENT OF ONE PRETENSION
I HAD SAID IN MY TALK WITH MRS GROSE ON THAT HORRID SCENE OF FLORA'S BY THE LAKE--AND HAD PERPLEXED HER BY SO SAYING--THAT IT WOULD FROM THAT MOMENT DISTRESS ME MUCH MORE TO LOSE MY POWER THAN TO KEEP IT
FOR IF IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I MIGHT OCCASIONALLY EXCITE SUSPICION BY THE LITTLE OUTBREAKS OF MY SHARPER PASSION FOR THEM SO TOO I REMEMBER WONDERING IF I MIGHTN'T SEE A QUEERNESS IN THE TRACEABLE INCREASE OF THEIR OWN DEMONSTRATIONS
MRS GROSE WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SPELL
NOT SO BAD BUT THAT SHE'LL PRESENTLY BE BETTER
WHEN HE AT LAST TURNED ROUND TO MEET ME IT WAS ALMOST AS IF THIS GENIUS HAD SUCCUMBED
YES"--SHE LET ME HAVE IT--"EVEN ABOUT THEM THEM--THAT CREATURE I HAD TO SMOTHER A KIND OF HOWL
THEY'RE TALKING OF THEM--THEY'RE TALKING HORRORS
THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF TIME FOR THAT
I DON'T CHANGE--I SIMPLY MAKE IT OUT
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO NOTHING IN THE WORLD
BUT I FORGET WHAT YOU DID IT FOR YOU FORGET?"--HE SPOKE WITH THE SWEET EXTRAVAGANCE OF CHILDISH REPROACH
I WANT A NEW FIELD HE SAID IT WITH ADMIRABLE SERENITY WITH POSITIVE UNIMPEACHABLE GAIETY
WHY WHEN I WENT DOWN--WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE OH YES
THEN YOU ADMIT IT'S WHAT SHE WAS I CRIED
HE HAS NOT LITERALLY EVER IN THESE WEEKS THAT I MYSELF HAVE LIVED WITH HIM AND SO CLOSELY WATCHED HIM
HE HAD PUT THEM IN POSSESSION OF BLY WHICH WAS HEALTHY AND SECURE AND HAD PLACED AT THE HEAD OF THEIR LITTLE ESTABLISHMENT--BUT BELOW STAIRS ONLY--AN EXCELLENT WOMAN MRS GROSE WHOM HE WAS SURE HIS VISITOR WOULD LIKE AND WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN MAID TO HIS MOTHER
IT'S QUITE TOO HORRIBLE THIS NATURALLY WAS DECLARED BY SEVERAL VOICES TO GIVE THE THING THE UTMOST PRICE AND OUR FRIEND WITH QUIET ART PREPARED HIS TRIUMPH BY TURNING HIS EYES OVER THE REST OF US AND GOING ON
I COULDN'T HAVE COME OUT NEITHER COULD I I LAUGHED AGAIN
THERE WAS MANY A CORNER ROUND WHICH I EXPECTED TO COME UPON QUINT AND MANY A SITUATION THAT IN A MERELY SINISTER WAY WOULD HAVE FAVORED THE APPEARANCE OF MISS JESSEL
EITHER YOU CLEAR UP WITH MY GUARDIAN THE MYSTERY OF THIS INTERRUPTION OF MY STUDIES OR YOU CEASE TO EXPECT ME TO LEAD WITH YOU A LIFE THAT'S SO UNNATURAL FOR A BOY WHAT WAS SO UNNATURAL FOR THE PARTICULAR BOY I WAS CONCERNED WITH WAS THIS SUDDEN REVELATION OF A CONSCIOUSNESS AND A PLAN
THEN MY STEP TO MY UNUTTERABLE RELIEF PRODUCED AN ANSWERING SOUND
AFTER WHICH WITH HER LITTLE DIVINE SMILE
I SLEPT LITTLE THAT NIGHT--I WAS TOO MUCH EXCITED
AND SHE HAD PATTERED STRAIGHT OVER TO ME THROWN HERSELF UPON MY KNEE GIVEN HERSELF TO BE HELD WITH THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE FULL IN THE WONDERFUL LITTLE FACE THAT WAS STILL FLUSHED WITH SLEEP
THIS PERSON PROVED ON HER PRESENTING HERSELF FOR JUDGMENT AT A HOUSE IN HARLEY STREET THAT IMPRESSED HER AS VAST AND IMPOSING--THIS PROSPECTIVE PATRON PROVED A GENTLEMAN A BACHELOR IN THE PRIME OF LIFE SUCH A FIGURE AS HAD NEVER RISEN SAVE IN A DREAM OR AN OLD NOVEL BEFORE A FLUTTERED ANXIOUS GIRL OUT OF A HAMPSHIRE VICARAGE
I NEEDED NOTHING MORE THAN THIS TO FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF MRS GROSE'S COMPARISON AND CATCHING MY PUPIL IN MY ARMS COVERED HER WITH KISSES IN WHICH THERE WAS A SOB OF ATONEMENT
IT'S ONLY THAT IT'S NOTHING BUT THAT AND I'D RATHER DIE THAN GIVE YOU A PAIN OR DO YOU A WRONG--I'D RATHER DIE THAN HURT A HAIR OF YOU
I PRESSED AGAIN OF COURSE AT THIS
YOU MAY IMAGINE THE GENERAL COMPLEXION FROM THAT MOMENT OF MY NIGHTS
THERE WAS ALAS A DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT
HE HAD ME INDEED AND IN A CLEFT STICK
TWO HOURS AGO IN THE GARDEN"--I COULD SCARCE ARTICULATE--"FLORA SAW MRS GROSE TOOK IT AS SHE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A BLOW IN THE STOMACH
FROM OUR END OF THE GREAT BROWN HALL WE HEARD HIS STEP ON THE STAIR
I CAME STRAIGHT OUT OF THE CHURCHYARD AND THINKING HARD RETRACED MY STEPS THROUGH THE PARK
WHILE THIS WAS DONE MILES STOOD AGAIN WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS LITTLE POCKETS AND HIS BACK TO ME--STOOD AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WIDE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH THAT OTHER DAY I HAD SEEN WHAT PULLED ME UP
NONE WHATEVER AT LEAST IN THE CONVICTION I FROM ONE MOMENT TO ANOTHER FOUND MYSELF FORMING AS TO WHAT I SHOULD SEE STRAIGHT BEFORE ME AND ACROSS THE LAKE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF RAISING MY EYES
THE CHILDREN SHAN'T SHE EMPHATICALLY RETURNED
HE OF COURSE WAS THEIR UNCLE IN HARLEY STREET
WHILE THIS DUMB CONVULSION LASTED I COULD ONLY WATCH IT--WHICH I DID THE MORE INTENTLY WHEN I SAW FLORA'S FACE PEEP AT ME OVER OUR COMPANION'S SHOULDER
YOU MEAN THAT SINCE YESTERDAY YOU HAVE SEEN SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH DIGNITY
THE TRICK'S PLAYED I WENT ON
THE LIMIT OF THIS EVIL TIME HAD ARRIVED ONLY WHEN ON THE DAWN OF A WINTER'S MORNING PETER QUINT WAS FOUND BY A LABORER GOING TO EARLY WORK STONE DEAD ON THE ROAD FROM THE VILLAGE
THIS WAS A RULE INDEED WHICH ONLY ADDED TO THE SATIRIC EFFECT OF MY BEING PLIED WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT HE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT BE AMONG US
WHAT DID YOU DO YOU NAUGHTY BAD THING
IT WAS ALL IN THE OTHER QUARTER THAT AFTER A LULL THE GROSSNESS BROKE OUT
I HESITATED AFRESH BUT ON OTHER GROUNDS AND ONLY FOR A FEW SECONDS
THEN EXACTLY AFTER A MINUTE AS IF TO ADD TO THE SPECTACLE HE SLOWLY CHANGED HIS PLACE--PASSED LOOKING AT ME HARD ALL THE WHILE TO THE OPPOSITE CORNER OF THE PLATFORM
AH IF YOU CAN'T BEAR IT HOW CAN I STOP WITH HER YOU MEAN
IT SEEMS TO ME INDEED IN RETROSPECT THAT BY THE TIME THE MORROW'S SUN WAS HIGH I HAD RESTLESSLY READ INTO THE FACT BEFORE US ALMOST ALL THE MEANING THEY WERE TO RECEIVE FROM SUBSEQUENT AND MORE CRUEL OCCURRENCES
BUT HE IS HANDSOME I SAW THE WAY TO HELP HER
IT WAS WHEN AT MIDNIGHT SHE HAD HER HAND ON THE SCHOOLROOM DOOR TO TAKE LEAVE
WHAT'S OUT AS I TOLD YOU WITH MILES IS THAT IF HE THINKS I'M AFRAID TO--AND HAS IDEAS OF WHAT HE GAINS BY THAT--HE SHALL SEE HE'S MISTAKEN
WE SHOULDN'T LIKE THAT I WENT ON
DOES MY UNCLE THINK WHAT YOU THINK I MARKEDLY RESTED
SCARCE ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE HISTORY SEEMS TO ME SO ODD AS THIS FACT THAT MY REAL BEGINNING OF FEAR WAS ONE AS I MAY SAY WITH THE INSTINCT OF SPARING MY COMPANION
I CALL THE SISTERHOOD TO WITNESS!--I MADE CONSTANT FRESH DISCOVERIES
XVIII THE NEXT DAY AFTER LESSONS MRS GROSE FOUND A MOMENT TO SAY TO ME QUIETLY
IT'S BEYOND EVERYTHING
I CAN'T EXPRESS WHAT FOLLOWED IT SAVE BY SAYING THAT THE SILENCE ITSELF--WHICH WAS INDEED IN A MANNER AN ATTESTATION OF MY STRENGTH--BECAME THE ELEMENT INTO WHICH I SAW THE FIGURE DISAPPEAR
MY CHARMING WORK WAS JUST MY LIFE WITH MILES AND FLORA AND THROUGH NOTHING COULD I SO LIKE IT AS THROUGH FEELING THAT I COULD THROW MYSELF INTO IT IN TROUBLE
MY NEED TO RESPECT THE BLOOM OF MRS GROSE'S HAD DROPPED WITHOUT A RUSTLE FROM MY SHOULDERS AND IF I WAVERED FOR THE INSTANT IT WAS NOT WITH WHAT I KEPT BACK
MY VISION WAS INSTANTANEOUS
BUT INFAMOUS SHE SLOWLY CAME BACK TO ME
THERE CAME SUDDENLY AN HOUR AFTER WHICH AS I LOOK BACK THE AFFAIR SEEMS TO ME TO HAVE BEEN ALL PURE SUFFERING
I OVERTOOK HER I REMEMBER ON THE STAIRCASE
WHY IN THE WORLD TO WORRY US SO--AND TAKE OUR THOUGHTS OFF TOO DON'T YOU KNOW?--DID YOU DESERT US AT THE VERY DOOR I COULDN'T MEET SUCH QUESTIONS NOR AS THEY ASKED THEM THEIR FALSE LITTLE LOVELY EYES
THEY HARASSED ME SO THAT SOMETIMES AT ODD MOMENTS I SHUT MYSELF UP AUDIBLY TO REHEARSE--IT WAS AT ONCE A FANTASTIC RELIEF AND A RENEWED DESPAIR--THE MANNER IN WHICH I MIGHT COME TO THE POINT
WE WERE HELD BY IT A MINUTE
SHE DID WISH TO LEARN AND SHE DID LEARN
THEN I ANSWERED
AND I MERELY ASKED WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW
HE WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE SURE THAN EVER TO PASS HIS ARM INTO MINE AND MAKE ME SIT THERE FOR AN HOUR IN CLOSE SILENT CONTACT WITH HIS COMMENTARY ON OUR TALK
I HAD UNDERTAKEN WITH MY COMPANION TO SEE IT OUT AND I WAS UNDER A CHARM APPARENTLY THAT COULD SMOOTH AWAY THE EXTENT AND THE FAR AND DIFFICULT CONNECTIONS OF SUCH AN EFFORT
TO GET HER AWAY
NO HE NEVER SPOKE OF IT NEVER MENTIONED HER IN CONNECTION WITH QUINT SHE SAW VISIBLY FLUSHING WHERE I WAS COMING OUT
DO YOU FEAR FOR THEM WE MET IN ANOTHER LONG LOOK
I SECURED FIVE MINUTES WITH HER IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM WHERE IN THE TWILIGHT AMID A SMELL OF LATELY BAKED BREAD BUT WITH THE PLACE ALL SWEPT AND GARNISHED I FOUND HER SITTING IN PAINED PLACIDITY BEFORE THE FIRE
YES YES
THERE'S ONE THING OF COURSE--IT OCCURS TO ME--TO REMEMBER
IF NOTHING COMES I SHALL ONLY FAIL AND YOU WILL AT THE WORST HAVE HELPED ME BY DOING ON YOUR ARRIVAL IN TOWN WHATEVER YOU MAY HAVE FOUND POSSIBLE SO I PUT IT BEFORE HER BUT SHE CONTINUED FOR A LITTLE SO INSCRUTABLY EMBARRASSED THAT I CAME AGAIN TO HER AID
THE TRUE KNIGHTS WE LOVE TO READ ABOUT NEVER PUSH AN ADVANTAGE TOO FAR
I WENT IN WITH MY LIGHT AND FOUND HIM IN BED VERY WIDE AWAKE BUT VERY MUCH AT HIS EASE
I WAS MUCH THERE THAT YEAR--IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL ONE
I'M AFRAID HOWEVER I REMEMBER FEELING THE IMPULSE TO ADD I'M RATHER EASILY CARRIED AWAY
BUT IT TOOK ME SOME TIME TO BE WHOLLY SURE OF WHAT MY HONEST ALLY WAS PREPARED FOR TO KEEP TERMS WITH SO COMPROMISING A CONTRACT
THE GREAT QUESTION OR ONE OF THESE IS AFTERWARD I KNOW WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN MATTERS THE QUESTION OF HOW LONG THEY HAVE LASTED
THEY WERE BOTH HERE--LAST YEAR
I SAT READING BY A COUPLE OF CANDLES
WE MET AFTER I HAD BROUGHT HOME LITTLE MILES MORE INTIMATELY THAN EVER ON THE GROUND OF MY STUPEFACTION MY GENERAL EMOTION
THERE WOULD BE TIME ENOUGH TO SEND IT BEFORE THE MESSENGER SHOULD GO TO THE VILLAGE
AND IN THIS POSITION I BEGAN TO TAKE IN WITH CERTITUDE AND YET WITHOUT DIRECT VISION THE PRESENCE AT A DISTANCE OF A THIRD PERSON
YOU SHALL SEE OH THANK YOU MY FRIEND CRIED PLANTED SO FIRM THAT TAKING IT IN I WENT STRAIGHT ON WITHOUT HER
I SEE NOTHING
BUT WHERE IN THE WORLD AWAY FROM HERE
BUT YOU WON'T NO NOT THAT AGAIN
FLORA A SHORT WAY OFF STOOD BEFORE US ON THE GRASS AND SMILED AS IF HER PERFORMANCE WAS NOW COMPLETE
THAT HIS UNCLE SHOULD ARRIVE TO TREAT WITH ME OF THESE THINGS WAS A SOLUTION THAT STRICTLY SPEAKING I OUGHT NOW TO HAVE DESIRED TO BRING ON
NEVER WAS A SMALL NATURAL CREATURE TO THE UNINITIATED EYE ALL FRANKNESS AND FREEDOM A MORE INGENIOUS A MORE EXTRAORDINARY LITTLE GENTLEMAN
IF THE CHILD GIVES THE EFFECT ANOTHER TURN OF THE SCREW WHAT DO YOU SAY TO TWO CHILDREN WE SAY OF COURSE SOMEBODY EXCLAIMED THAT THEY GIVE TWO TURNS
TO BE REALLY AT A LOSS HOW TO QUALIFY IT
WITH THIS I HAD THE FULL IMAGE OF A REPETITION OF WHAT HAD ALREADY OCCURRED
AND THE LITTLE BOY--DOES HE LOOK LIKE HER
AN IDEA IN WHICH MRS GROSE CONCURRED SO HEARTILY THAT I SOMEHOW TOOK HER MANNER AS A KIND OF COMFORTING PLEDGE--NEVER FALSIFIED THANK HEAVEN!--THAT WE SHOULD ON EVERY QUESTION BE QUITE AT ONE
NEVER LITTLE MILES--NO NEVER--HAVE YOU GIVEN ME AN INKLING OF ANYTHING THAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED THERE
NOBODY BUT ME TILL NOW HAS EVER HEARD
THAT'S WHAT FLORA KNOWS AFTER A LITTLE SHE TURNED ROUND
I PUT OUT MY HAND TO HER AND SHE TOOK IT
THE RIGHT ONE SUDDENLY PRESENTED ITSELF TO ME AS THE LOWER ONE--THOUGH HIGH ABOVE THE GARDENS--IN THE SOLID CORNER OF THE HOUSE THAT I HAVE SPOKEN OF AS THE OLD TOWER
FANCY IT HERE--FOR A GOVERNESS
THE MOST SINGULAR PART OF IT IN FACT--SINGULAR AS THE REST HAD BEEN--WAS THE PART I BECAME IN THE HALL AWARE OF IN MEETING MRS GROSE
THIS THOUGHT HELD ME SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE ME CROSS TO HIS THRESHOLD AND PAUSE AGAIN
THEY NOT ONLY POPPED OUT AT ME AS TIGERS AND AS ROMANS BUT AS SHAKESPEAREANS ASTRONOMERS AND NAVIGATORS
YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL HIM--ABOUT THE WAY YOU'VE LET IT ALL DROP
YET SHE NONETHELESS TOOK THE MEASURE I THINK OF THE WARNING I NOW GAVE HER
YOU LIKE THEM WITH THE SPIRIT TO BE NAUGHTY THEN KEEPING PACE WITH HER ANSWER SO DO I I EAGERLY BROUGHT OUT
SHE WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CHILD I HAD EVER SEEN AND I AFTERWARD WONDERED THAT MY EMPLOYER HAD NOT TOLD ME MORE OF HER
HE WAS QUIET
VERY MUCH SMALLER YES A MERE FRACTION OF THE WHOLE
YES--TOMORROW
IT WAS ONLY TO BUT HE GAVE A SICK LITTLE HEADSHAKE
WE HAD IT FROM HIM AGAIN BEFORE THE FIRE IN THE HALL AS WE HAD HAD OUR MILD WONDERS OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
IT WAS IN FACT THE VERY APPROPRIATE TRUTH THAT SHE HAD VENTURED TO CRITICIZE THE PROPRIETY TO HINT AT THE INCONGRUITY OF SO CLOSE AN ALLIANCE AND EVEN TO GO SO FAR ON THE SUBJECT AS A FRANK OVERTURE TO MISS JESSEL
IT WAS I WHO BLEW IT DEAR SAID MILES
BEFORE WHAT BEFORE YOU CAME BACK
IT WAS EXACTLY AS IF MY CHARGES KNEW HOW ALMOST MORE AWKWARD THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT BE FOR ME
I REMEMBER THE TIME AND THE PLACE--THE CORNER OF THE LAWN THE SHADE OF THE GREAT BEECHES AND THE LONG HOT SUMMER AFTERNOON
DEAL WITH HIM
YES I VENTURE STILL TO THINK IT
SURELY YOU DON'T ACCUSE HIM OF CARRYING ON AN INTERCOURSE THAT HE CONCEALS FROM ME
WHAT I LOOK BACK AT WITH AMAZEMENT IS THE SITUATION I ACCEPTED
XIX WE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE LAKE AS IT WAS CALLED AT BLY AND I DARESAY RIGHTLY CALLED THOUGH I REFLECT THAT IT MAY IN FACT HAVE BEEN A SHEET OF WATER LESS REMARKABLE THAN IT APPEARED TO MY UNTRAVELED EYES
I RECOLLECT IN SHORT THAT THOUGH I WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN MY AUTHOR I FOUND MYSELF AT THE TURN OF A PAGE AND WITH HIS SPELL ALL SCATTERED LOOKING STRAIGHT UP FROM HIM AND HARD AT THE DOOR OF MY ROOM
BUT NOT TO THE DEGREE TO CONTAMINATE TO CONTAMINATE?"--MY BIG WORD LEFT HER AT A LOSS
I DASHED AT THE PLACE IN WHICH I HAD LEFT HER LYING AND OVER WHICH FOR THE SMALL SILK COUNTERPANE AND THE SHEETS WERE DISARRANGED THE WHITE CURTAINS HAD BEEN DECEIVINGLY PULLED FORWARD
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE LIKE HIM
IT WAS AS IF AT MOMENTS WE WERE PERPETUALLY COMING INTO SIGHT OF SUBJECTS BEFORE WHICH WE MUST STOP SHORT TURNING SUDDENLY OUT OF ALLEYS THAT WE PERCEIVED TO BE BLIND CLOSING WITH A LITTLE BANG THAT MADE US LOOK AT EACH OTHER--FOR LIKE ALL BANGS IT WAS SOMETHING LOUDER THAN WE HAD INTENDED--THE DOORS WE HAD INDISCREETLY OPENED
FLORA CONTINUED TO FIX ME WITH HER SMALL MASK OF REPROBATION AND EVEN AT THAT MINUTE I PRAYED GOD TO FORGIVE ME FOR SEEMING TO SEE THAT AS SHE STOOD THERE HOLDING TIGHT TO OUR FRIEND'S DRESS HER INCOMPARABLE CHILDISH BEAUTY HAD SUDDENLY FAILED HAD QUITE VANISHED
I USED TO SPECULATE--BUT EVEN THIS WITH A DIM DISCONNECTEDNESS--AS TO HOW THE ROUGH FUTURE FOR ALL FUTURES ARE ROUGH WOULD HANDLE THEM AND MIGHT BRUISE THEM
BY THE TIME I REACHED THE POOL HOWEVER SHE WAS CLOSE BEHIND ME AND I KNEW THAT WHATEVER TO HER APPREHENSION MIGHT BEFALL ME THE EXPOSURE OF MY SOCIETY STRUCK HER AS HER LEAST DANGER
YES--I TOOK IT AT THIS WITH A MOAN OF JOY I ENFOLDED I DREW HIM CLOSE
SHE WAS MY SISTER'S GOVERNESS HE QUIETLY SAID
SHE ROSE ERECT ON THE SPOT MY FRIEND AND I HAD LATELY QUITTED AND THERE WAS NOT IN ALL THE LONG REACH OF HER DESIRE AN INCH OF HER EVIL THAT FELL SHORT
I REMEMBER CLOSING MY EYES AN INSTANT YIELDINGLY CONSCIOUSLY AS BEFORE THE EXCESS OF SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL THAT SHONE OUT OF THE BLUE OF HER OWN
THE FACE THAT WAS CLOSE TO MINE WAS AS WHITE AS THE FACE AGAINST THE GLASS AND OUT OF IT PRESENTLY CAME A SOUND NOT LOW NOR WEAK BUT AS IF FROM MUCH FURTHER AWAY THAT I DRANK LIKE A WAFT OF FRAGRANCE
ON THE POINT OF TAKING LEAVE OF HER NONETHELESS I WAS TO SOME EXTENT EMBARRASSED
BUT THERE'S A DEEP DESIGN ON EITHER SIDE TO SHORTEN THE DISTANCE AND OVERCOME THE OBSTACLE
I WONDERED IF HIS BED WERE ALSO EMPTY AND HE TOO WERE SECRETLY AT WATCH
AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MAIN CONDITION WHICH WAS THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER TROUBLE HIM--BUT NEVER NEVER
THE ONLY THING INDEED THAT IN THIS EARLY OUTLOOK MIGHT HAVE MADE ME SHRINK AGAIN WAS THE CLEAR CIRCUMSTANCE OF HER BEING SO GLAD TO SEE ME
DO YOU MEAN OF DISLIKE GOD HELP US NO
SHE HAD ALREADY GOT BACK HER GAIETY AND APPEARED TO TAKE THIS AS AN ANSWER QUITE SUFFICIENT
SHE HERSELF HAD SEEN NOTHING NOT THE SHADOW OF A SHADOW AND NOBODY IN THE HOUSE BUT THE GOVERNESS WAS IN THE GOVERNESS'S PLIGHT
BUT WE MUST GO ON HE RESUMED OUR WALK WITH ME PASSING HIS HAND INTO MY ARM
I HAD NOT SUSPECTED IN ADVANCE THAT HER COMFORTABLE FACE WOULD PULL ME UP AND I SOMEHOW MEASURED THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT I HAD SEEN BY MY THUS FINDING MYSELF HESITATE TO MENTION IT
THE WHOLE THING WAS VIRTUALLY OUT BETWEEN US
TO GAZE INTO THE DEPTHS OF BLUE OF THE CHILD'S EYES AND PRONOUNCE THEIR LOVELINESS A TRICK OF PREMATURE CUNNING WAS TO BE GUILTY OF A CYNICISM IN PREFERENCE TO WHICH I NATURALLY PREFERRED TO ABJURE MY JUDGMENT AND SO FAR AS MIGHT BE MY AGITATION
THIS PICTURE COMES BACK TO ME IN THE GENERAL TRAIN--THE IMPRESSION AS I RECEIVED IT ON MY RETURN OF THE WIDE WHITE PANELLED SPACE BRIGHT IN THE LAMPLIGHT AND WITH ITS PORTRAITS AND RED CARPET AND OF THE GOOD SURPRISED LOOK OF MY FRIEND WHICH IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME SHE HAD MISSED ME
IF HE HAD GIVEN ME SUCH A BOLD HARD STARE THAT WAS BUT A PART OF HIS INDISCRETION
DRIVING AT THAT HOUR ON A LOVELY DAY THROUGH A COUNTRY TO WHICH THE SUMMER SWEETNESS SEEMED TO OFFER ME A FRIENDLY WELCOME MY FORTITUDE MOUNTED AFRESH AND AS WE TURNED INTO THE AVENUE ENCOUNTERED A REPRIEVE THAT WAS PROBABLY BUT A PROOF OF THE POINT TO WHICH IT HAD SUNK
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN GOOD--THEY'VE ONLY BEEN ABSENT
THESE CHILDREN WERE BY THE STRANGEST OF CHANCES FOR A MAN IN HIS POSITION--A LONE MAN WITHOUT THE RIGHT SORT OF EXPERIENCE OR A GRAIN OF PATIENCE--VERY HEAVILY ON HIS HANDS
I SHOULD NOT FOR INSTANCE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASSEVERATE TO MY FRIEND THAT I WAS CERTAIN--WHICH WAS SO MUCH TO THE GOOD--THAT I AT LEAST HAD NOT BETRAYED MYSELF
I_'LL TELL HIM I MEASURED THIS
HE NEVER WORE HIS HAT BUT HE DID WEAR--WELL THERE WERE WAISTCOATS MISSED
ONLY PUT IT TO ME AGAIN I CRIED IN A WAY THAT MADE MY FRIEND STARE
SOMETHING IN HIS TONE AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE AS I GOT THIS FROM HIM SET MY HEART ACHING WITH SUCH A PANG AS IT HAD NEVER YET KNOWN
AND IF THERE ARE THOSE WHO THINK HE HAD BETTER HAVE BEEN KICKING A FOOTBALL I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I WHOLLY AGREE WITH THEM
DID SHE SEE ANYTHING IN THE BOY THAT WASN'T RIGHT
YET MY HANDS--BUT IT WAS FOR PURE TENDERNESS--SHOOK HIM AS IF TO ASK HIM WHY IF IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING HE HAD CONDEMNED ME TO MONTHS OF TORMENT
IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLE SHE WAS EVIDENTLY GRATEFUL FOR SUCH A PROFESSION
WASN'T IT JUST A STORYBOOK OVER WHICH I HAD FALLEN ADOZE AND ADREAM
THERE WAS A SUNDAY--TO GET ON--WHEN IT RAINED WITH SUCH FORCE AND FOR SO MANY HOURS THAT THERE COULD BE NO PROCESSION TO CHURCH
OH YES WE MAY SIT HERE AND LOOK AT THEM AND THEY MAY SHOW OFF TO US THERE TO THEIR FILL
THEN--AS IF TO SHARE THEM--CAME TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEARTH AND SANK INTO A CHAIR
SHE WAS ALSO YOUNG AND PRETTY--ALMOST AS YOUNG AND ALMOST AS PRETTY MISS EVEN AS YOU AH THEN I HOPE HER YOUTH AND HER BEAUTY HELPED HER I RECOLLECT THROWING OFF
AND YOU CAN'T SAY I'VE NOT BEEN AWFULLY GOOD CAN YOU I LAID MY HAND ON HIS SHOULDER FOR THOUGH I FELT HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO WALK ON I WAS NOT YET QUITE ABLE
OH I'M HAPPY ENOUGH ANYWHERE WELL THEN I QUAVERED IF YOU'RE JUST AS HAPPY HERE AH BUT THAT ISN'T EVERYTHING
XI IT WAS NOT TILL LATE NEXT DAY THAT I SPOKE TO MRS GROSE
I REFLECTED ACUTELY THAT THE SENSE OF SUCH DIFFERENCES SUCH SUPERIORITIES OF QUALITY ALWAYS ON THE PART OF THE MAJORITY--WHICH COULD INCLUDE EVEN STUPID SORDID HEADMASTERS--TURN INFALLIBLY TO THE VINDICTIVE
YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL HIM A TREMENDOUS LOT THE EXULTATION WITH WHICH HE UTTERED THIS HELPED ME SOMEHOW FOR THE INSTANT TO MEET HIM RATHER MORE
WELL THEN FINISH IT I WAITED A MINUTE
IT WAS NOTHING IT WAS NOTHING I SAID
IT HAD ALREADY LASTED A MINUTE AND IT LASTED WHILE I CONTINUED SEIZING MY COLLEAGUE QUITE THRUSTING HER AT IT AND PRESENTING HER TO IT TO INSIST WITH MY POINTING HAND
IN HARLEY STREET IN HARLEY STREET WELL MISS YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST--AND YOU WON'T BE THE LAST OH I'VE NO PRETENSION I COULD LAUGH TO BEING THE ONLY ONE
I WAS LIKE A GAOLER WITH AN EYE TO POSSIBLE SURPRISES AND ESCAPES
SUDDENLY IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I BECAME AWARE THAT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEA OF AZOF WE HAD AN INTERESTED SPECTATOR
TORMENTED IN THE HALL WITH DIFFICULTIES AND OBSTACLES I REMEMBER SINKING DOWN AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE--SUDDENLY COLLAPSING THERE ON THE LOWEST STEP AND THEN WITH A REVULSION RECALLING THAT IT WAS EXACTLY WHERE MORE THAN A MONTH BEFORE IN THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT AND JUST SO BOWED WITH EVIL THINGS I HAD SEEN THE SPECTER OF THE MOST HORRIBLE OF WOMEN
IF YOU SHOULD SO LOSE YOUR HEAD AS TO APPEAL TO HIM FOR ME SHE WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED
WHY OF HIM OF THE MASTER OF WHO ELSE THERE WAS SO OBVIOUSLY NO ONE ELSE THAT THE NEXT MOMENT I HAD LOST MY IMPRESSION OF HER HAVING ACCIDENTALLY SAID MORE THAN SHE MEANT
SHE STARED IN SHORT AND RETREATED ON JUST MY LINES AND I KNEW SHE HAD THEN PASSED OUT AND COME ROUND TO ME AND THAT I SHOULD PRESENTLY MEET HER
BUT SHE WAS A MAGNIFICENT MONUMENT TO THE BLESSING OF A WANT OF IMAGINATION AND IF SHE COULD SEE IN OUR LITTLE CHARGES NOTHING BUT THEIR BEAUTY AND AMIABILITY THEIR HAPPINESS AND CLEVERNESS SHE HAD NO DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE SOURCES OF MY TROUBLE
TO SEE HER WITHOUT A CONVULSION OF HER SMALL PINK FACE NOT EVEN FEIGN TO GLANCE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRODIGY I ANNOUNCED BUT ONLY INSTEAD OF THAT TURN AT ME AN EXPRESSION OF HARD STILL GRAVITY AN EXPRESSION ABSOLUTELY NEW AND UNPRECEDENTED AND THAT APPEARED TO READ AND ACCUSE AND JUDGE ME--THIS WAS A STROKE THAT SOMEHOW CONVERTED THE LITTLE GIRL HERSELF INTO THE VERY PRESENCE THAT COULD MAKE ME QUAIL
THEREFORE I COULD PATCH UP NOTHING AND IT WAS TOO EXTREME AN EFFORT TO SQUEEZE BESIDE HIM INTO THE PEW
I HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO ASK HIM
MILES MAY NEVER GO BACK AT ALL CONSCIOUSLY UNDER MY ATTENTION SHE REDDENED
WHAT I HAD UNDERTAKEN WAS THE WHOLE CARE OF HER AND SHE HAD REMAINED JUST THIS LAST TIME WITH MRS GROSE ONLY AS AN EFFECT OF OUR CONSIDERATION FOR MY INEVITABLE STRANGENESS AND HER NATURAL TIMIDITY
HE HAD HIS FREEDOM NOW--HE MIGHT HAVE IT TO THE END
IN THIS STATE OF MIND I SPENT THE LONG HOURS OF BUMPING SWINGING COACH THAT CARRIED ME TO THE STOPPING PLACE AT WHICH I WAS TO BE MET BY A VEHICLE FROM THE HOUSE
THERE WAS TOO LITTLE OF THE EXPLAINED THROW OUT WHATEVER WE MIGHT IN THE SUDDENNESS OF MY COLLEAGUE'S ACT
BUT OF WHOM DID YOU SPEAK FIRST SHE LOOKED BLANK BUT SHE COLORED
UNTIL YOU CAME OUT THAT WAY THIS MORNING YOU HAD SINCE THE FIRST HOUR I SAW YOU SCARCE EVEN MADE A REFERENCE TO ANYTHING IN YOUR PREVIOUS LIFE
THAT HE'S AN INJURY TO THE OTHERS AT THIS WITH ONE OF THE QUICK TURNS OF SIMPLE FOLK SHE SUDDENLY FLAMED UP
INSTEAD OF GAILY DENOUNCING AND CARESSING ME THEY MADE NO ALLUSION TO MY HAVING FAILED THEM AND I WAS LEFT FOR THE TIME ON PERCEIVING THAT SHE TOO SAID NOTHING TO STUDY MRS GROSE'S ODD FACE
BUT PLEASE MISS SAID MRS GROSE I MUST GET TO MY WORK III HER THUS TURNING HER BACK ON ME WAS FORTUNATELY NOT FOR MY JUST PREOCCUPATIONS A SNUB THAT COULD CHECK THE GROWTH OF OUR MUTUAL ESTEEM
WHAT WILL YOU SAY THEN SHE IMMEDIATELY ADDED
WHOM DO YOU MEAN BY HE PETER QUINT--YOU DEVIL HIS FACE GAVE AGAIN ROUND THE ROOM ITS CONVULSED SUPPLICATION
AN UNKNOWN MAN IN A LONELY PLACE IS A PERMITTED OBJECT OF FEAR TO A YOUNG WOMAN PRIVATELY BRED
IMPUDENT ASSURED SPOILED DEPRAVED
THEY'RE NOT MINE--THEY'RE NOT OURS
SHE'S AT A DISTANCE I HAD MADE UP MY MIND
I FOUND HER ON MY RETURN IN THE SCHOOLROOM AND WHAT DID SHE SAY I CAN HEAR THE GOOD WOMAN STILL AND THE CANDOR OF HER STUPEFACTION
THE PERSON LOOKING STRAIGHT IN WAS THE PERSON WHO HAD ALREADY APPEARED TO ME
PETER QUINT HAD COME INTO VIEW LIKE A SENTINEL BEFORE A PRISON
I WENT THE REST OF THE WAY UP
IT WAS AS IF WHEN WE WERE FACE TO FACE IN THE DINING ROOM HE HAD LITERALLY SHOWN ME THE WAY
THE CHILD OF EIGHT THAT CHILD UNUTTERABLE STILL FOR ME WAS THE STUPEFACTION OF IT
THIS CAME OUT WHEN AT THE SCHOOLROOM DOOR SHE QUITTED ME
ON THE SPOT THERE CAME TO ME THE ADDED SHOCK OF A CERTITUDE THAT IT WAS NOT FOR ME HE HAD COME THERE
MY OTHER PUPIL AT ANY RATE AS I UNDERSTAND COMES BACK TOMORROW NOT TOMORROW--FRIDAY MISS
WHAT WAS YOUR EXCEPTION AND TO WHAT PASSAGE IN YOUR PERSONAL OBSERVATION OF HIM DID YOU REFER IT WAS A DREADFULLY AUSTERE INQUIRY BUT LEVITY WAS NOT OUR NOTE AND AT ANY RATE BEFORE THE GRAY DAWN ADMONISHED US TO SEPARATE I HAD GOT MY ANSWER
MIGHTN'T ONE TO REACH HIS MIND RISK THE STRETCH OF AN ANGULAR ARM OVER HIS CHARACTER
EVERYTHING BUT A SORT OF PASSION OF TENDERNESS FOR HIM WAS SWEPT AWAY BY HIS PRESENCE
AT THIS POINT I PRECIPITATELY FOUND MYSELF AWARE OF THREE THINGS
THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT DREAD HAD UNMISTAKABLY QUITTED ME AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN ME THERE THAT DIDN'T MEET AND MEASURE HIM
UNLESS INDEED I WOUND UP YOU REALLY WANT NOT TO GO I COULD SEE IT IN HER FACE AT LAST CLEAR ITSELF
TO DO IT IN ANY WAY WAS AN ACT OF VIOLENCE FOR WHAT DID IT CONSIST OF BUT THE OBTRUSION OF THE IDEA OF GROSSNESS AND GUILT ON A SMALL HELPLESS CREATURE WHO HAD BEEN FOR ME A REVELATION OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF BEAUTIFUL INTERCOURSE
MY CONCLUSION BLOOMED THERE WITH THE REAL ROSE FLUSH OF HIS INNOCENCE
IS HE TOO SO VERY REMARKABLE ONE WOULDN'T FLATTER A CHILD
YOUR IDEA'S THE RIGHT ONE
SHE OFFERED HER MIND TO MY DISCLOSURES AS HAD I WISHED TO MIX A WITCH'S BROTH AND PROPOSED IT WITH ASSURANCE SHE WOULD HAVE HELD OUT A LARGE CLEAN SAUCEPAN
I WAS A SCREEN--I WAS TO STAND BEFORE THEM
WHEN WAS IT--ON THE TOWER ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH
IT'S ALL A MERE MISTAKE AND A WORRY AND A JOKE--AND WE'LL GO HOME AS FAST AS WE CAN OUR COMPANION ON THIS HAD RESPONDED WITH A STRANGE QUICK PRIMNESS OF PROPRIETY AND THEY WERE AGAIN WITH MRS GROSE ON HER FEET UNITED AS IT WERE IN PAINED OPPOSITION TO ME
WHAT SAVED ME AS I NOW SEE WAS THAT IT TURNED TO SOMETHING ELSE ALTOGETHER
A TIME SO FULL THAT AS I RECALL THE WAY IT WENT IT REMINDS ME OF ALL THE ART I NOW NEED TO MAKE IT A LITTLE DISTINCT
AND THE STRANGEST IF NOT THE BRIGHTEST THREAD IN THE PENSIVE EMBROIDERY I JUST SPOKE OF WAS THE IMPRESSION I MIGHT HAVE GOT IF I HAD DARED TO WORK IT OUT THAT HE WAS UNDER SOME INFLUENCE OPERATING IN HIS SMALL INTELLECTUAL LIFE AS A TREMENDOUS INCITEMENT
WE HAD PAUSED ON THE PATH FROM THE GATE BY A LOW OBLONG TABLELIKE TOMB
TO LEAVE ME IN ADDITION WITH MY REMEDY SHE WAS STILL VAGUE
IT WAS IN OBVIOUS SUBMISSION OF MEMORY THAT SHE BROUGHT OUT AFTER A MOMENT
BUT WHEN I WOKE IT WAS TO SIT STRAIGHT UP AS COMPLETELY ROUSED AS IF A HAND HAD SHOOK ME
IT WAS A DEEP SOUNDLESS MINUTE AT THE END OF WHICH MY IMPULSE FAILED
AND YET AS IF I HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF A PAIR OF LITTLE GRANDEES OF PRINCES OF THE BLOOD FOR WHOM EVERYTHING TO BE RIGHT WOULD HAVE TO BE ENCLOSED AND PROTECTED THE ONLY FORM THAT IN MY FANCY THE AFTERYEARS COULD TAKE FOR THEM WAS THAT OF A ROMANTIC A REALLY ROYAL EXTENSION OF THE GARDEN AND THE PARK
I STOPPED I ALMOST DROPPED WITH THE REAL RELIEF OF THIS
SHE HAD KNOWN SUDDENLY AS SHE LAY THERE THAT I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM AND HAD JUMPED UP TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF ME
BUT THAT SAME EVENING BEFORE WE SCATTERED HE BROUGHT OUT WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND
WENT OFF TO DIE MRS GROSE LOOKED STRAIGHT OUT OF THE WINDOW BUT I FELT THAT HYPOTHETICALLY I HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT YOUNG PERSONS ENGAGED FOR BLY WERE EXPECTED TO DO
YOU WANT SO TO GO OUT AGAIN AWFULLY HE SMILED AT ME HEROICALLY AND THE TOUCHING LITTLE BRAVERY OF IT WAS ENHANCED BY HIS ACTUALLY FLUSHING WITH PAIN
WHAT ARRESTED ME ON THE SPOT--AND WITH A SHOCK MUCH GREATER THAN ANY VISION HAD ALLOWED FOR--WAS THE SENSE THAT MY IMAGINATION HAD IN A FLASH TURNED REAL
SHE FIXED HER EYES ON THE DUSKIER DISTANCE THEN PULLING HERSELF TOGETHER TURNED TO ME WITH ABRUPT INCONSEQUENCE
THE CASE I MAY MENTION WAS THAT OF AN APPARITION IN JUST SUCH AN OLD HOUSE AS HAD GATHERED US FOR THE OCCASION--AN APPEARANCE OF A DREADFUL KIND TO A LITTLE BOY SLEEPING IN THE ROOM WITH HIS MOTHER AND WAKING HER UP IN THE TERROR OF IT
MASTER MILES ONLY SAID WE MUST DO NOTHING BUT WHAT SHE LIKES I WISH INDEED HE WOULD
AND HE KNEW I HAD NOT--I FOUND MYSELF AT THE END OF AN INSTANT MAGNIFICENTLY AWARE OF THIS
MY QUICKNESS WOULD HAVE TO BE REMARKABLE HOWEVER AND THE QUESTION OF A CONVEYANCE WAS THE GREAT ONE TO SETTLE
MRS GROSE SINCE THEN IN THE WAY OF MANNERS AND THINGS HAD DONE AS SHE COULD FOR FLORA
I ADMIRED THEM HAD FANCIES ABOUT THEM FOR WE COULD ALL PROFIT IN A DEGREE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY LOOMED THROUGH THE DUSK BY THE GRANDEUR OF THEIR ACTUAL BATTLEMENTS
THEY SIMPLY EXPRESS THEIR REGRET THAT IT SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP HIM
HE KNEW THAT HE WAS IN PRESENCE BUT KNEW NOT OF WHAT AND KNEW STILL LESS THAT I ALSO WAS AND THAT I DID KNOW
YOU SUPPOSE THEY REALLY TALK OF THEM I COULD MEET THIS WITH A CONFIDENCE
SHE'S NOT TOO ILL TO TRAVEL
A RIGID CONTROL FROM THE NEXT DAY WAS AS I HAVE SAID TO FOLLOW THEM
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ME OUT OF THE WINDOW I SAID
IT WAS SO RESPECTFULLY EASY
WAS HE A GENTLEMAN I FOUND I HAD NO NEED TO THINK
AND I BROUGHT OUT WITH DECISION
YES IF YOU DIDN'T HE LOOKED WHILE I WAITED AT THE GRAVES
AFTER ALL I SAID IT'S THEIR UNCLE'S FAULT
THIS WE PROMPTLY ARRANGED BETWEEN US
THE GOOD THING AFTER ALL WAS THAT WE SHOULD SURELY SEE NO MORE OF HIM
SEEING WHICH I WENT ON
BUT ONLY FOR THE HOLIDAYS
TOO FREE WITH MY BOY TOO FREE WITH EVERYONE I FORBORE FOR THE MOMENT TO ANALYZE THIS DESCRIPTION FURTHER THAN BY THE REFLECTION THAT A PART OF IT APPLIED TO SEVERAL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE HALF-DOZEN MAIDS AND MEN WHO WERE STILL OF OUR SMALL COLONY
I SAW--I CAN USE NO OTHER PHRASE--SO MUCH OF HIM THAT IT WAS AS IF IT WERE MORE THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS SHE LOOKED IMMENSELY SCARED AGAIN
FOR WHAT ELSE--WHEN HE'S SO CLEVER AND BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT
THEY MOVED SLOWLY IN UNISON BELOW US OVER THE LAWN THE BOY AS THEY WENT READING ALOUD FROM A STORYBOOK AND PASSING HIS ARM ROUND HIS SISTER TO KEEP HER QUITE IN TOUCH
I HAVE TO SEE LUKE I HAD NOT YET REDUCED HIM TO QUITE SO VULGAR A LIE AND I FELT PROPORTIONATELY ASHAMED
I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT IN FORM AT LEAST TO PUT IT TO HIM
THAT WAS THE QUESTION I USED TO PUT TO MY SCRAPPY RETIREMENTS
ONE OF THE THOUGHTS THAT AS I DON'T IN THE LEAST SHRINK NOW FROM NOTING USED TO BE WITH ME IN THESE WANDERINGS WAS THAT IT WOULD BE AS CHARMING AS A CHARMING STORY SUDDENLY TO MEET SOMEONE
AND THAT'S WHY TO SHARE THEM I FALTERED MYSELF WITH THE HORROR OF IT
TO WATCH TEACH FORM LITTLE FLORA WOULD TOO EVIDENTLY BE THE MAKING OF A HAPPY AND USEFUL LIFE
XVI I HAD SO PERFECTLY EXPECTED THAT THE RETURN OF MY PUPILS WOULD BE MARKED BY A DEMONSTRATION THAT I WAS FRESHLY UPSET AT HAVING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THEY WERE DUMB ABOUT MY ABSENCE
WELL YES--I MAY AS WELL MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT IT WAS PRECISELY FOR THAT HE WAITED SO LONG THAT I SUPPOSED IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPUDIATING THE ASSUMPTION ON WHICH MY ACTION HAD BEEN FOUNDED
THE ROAST MUTTON WAS ON THE TABLE AND I HAD DISPENSED WITH ATTENDANCE
THEY WERE RASCALS
AND YOU KNOW MY DEAR SHE DIDN'T DENY THIS BUT I REQUIRED I FELT NOT EVEN SO MUCH TELLING AS THAT
IT'S THERE--THE COWARD HORROR THERE FOR THE LAST TIME AT THIS AFTER A SECOND IN WHICH HIS HEAD MADE THE MOVEMENT OF A BAFFLED DOG'S ON A SCENT AND THEN GAVE A FRANTIC LITTLE SHAKE FOR AIR AND LIGHT HE WAS AT ME IN A WHITE RAGE BEWILDERED GLARING VAINLY OVER THE PLACE AND MISSING WHOLLY THOUGH IT NOW TO MY SENSE FILLED THE ROOM LIKE THE TASTE OF POISON THE WIDE OVERWHELMING PRESENCE
WHAT DID YOU TAKE IT FOR TO SEE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT ME YOU OPENED THE LETTER I OPENED IT MY EYES WERE NOW AS I HELD HIM OFF A LITTLE AGAIN ON MILES'S OWN FACE IN WHICH THE COLLAPSE OF MOCKERY SHOWED ME HOW COMPLETE WAS THE RAVAGE OF UNEASINESS
THIS I FELT AS SOON AS I HAD PUT TO HER THE QUESTION OF HER SENSE OF THE CHILD'S SINCERITY AS AGAINST MY OWN
I DO MEAN ON THE OTHER HAND THAT THE ELEMENT OF THE UNNAMED AND UNTOUCHED BECAME BETWEEN US GREATER THAN ANY OTHER AND THAT SO MUCH AVOIDANCE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFULLY EFFECTED WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF TACIT ARRANGEMENT
I MYSELF MISS WELL I CAN'T STAY THE LOOK SHE GAVE ME WITH IT MADE ME JUMP AT POSSIBILITIES
THEN THE MASTER WENT AND QUINT WAS ALONE I FOLLOWED BUT HALTING A LITTLE
IT'S TIME WE SHOULD BE AT CHURCH OH I'M NOT FIT FOR CHURCH WON'T IT DO YOU GOOD IT WON'T DO THEM
DO YOU MEAN HE'S A STRANGER OH VERY MUCH YET YOU DIDN'T TELL ME NO--FOR REASONS
I WAS SILENT AWHILE
SHE TURNED AWAY A LITTLE
BUT I MUST TAKE MY PLUNGE
HAVE YOU WRITTEN MISS YES--I'VE WRITTEN BUT I DIDN'T ADD--FOR THE HOUR--THAT MY LETTER SEALED AND DIRECTED WAS STILL IN MY POCKET
THE MUSICAL SENSE IN EACH OF THE CHILDREN WAS OF THE QUICKEST BUT THE ELDER IN ESPECIAL HAD A MARVELOUS KNACK OF CATCHING AND REPEATING
BUT HE DENIED CERTAIN OCCASIONS WHAT OCCASIONS WHEN THEY HAD BEEN ABOUT TOGETHER QUITE AS IF QUINT WERE HIS TUTOR--AND A VERY GRAND ONE--AND MISS JESSEL ONLY FOR THE LITTLE LADY
SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED BUT WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED
THE CHILD HAD AGAIN GOT UP--THIS TIME BLOWING OUT THE TAPER AND HAD AGAIN FOR SOME PURPOSE OF OBSERVATION OR RESPONSE SQUEEZED IN BEHIND THE BLIND AND WAS PEERING OUT INTO THE NIGHT
MY HEART HAD STOOD STILL FOR AN INSTANT WITH THE WONDER AND TERROR OF THE QUESTION WHETHER SHE TOO WOULD SEE
I FOUND IT SIMPLE IN MY IGNORANCE MY CONFUSION AND PERHAPS MY CONCEIT TO ASSUME THAT I COULD DEAL WITH A BOY WHOSE EDUCATION FOR THE WORLD WAS ALL ON THE POINT OF BEGINNING
AND WHERE'S MILES SHE WENT ON
THEREFORE DID YOU BUT I COULDN'T SAY IT AGAIN
WHERE ON EARTH DO YOU SEE ANYTHING I COULD ONLY GRASP HER MORE QUICKLY YET FOR EVEN WHILE SHE SPOKE THE HIDEOUS PLAIN PRESENCE STOOD UNDIMMED AND UNDAUNTED
THE MOMENT WAS SO PROLONGED THAT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN BUT LITTLE MORE TO MAKE ME DOUBT IF EVEN I WERE IN LIFE
IT HAD ALL BEEN A GREAT WORRY AND ON HIS OWN PART DOUBTLESS A SERIES OF BLUNDERS BUT HE IMMENSELY PITIED THE POOR CHICKS AND HAD DONE ALL HE COULD
ONLY THAT I THINK WAS TO GET ME TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU IT WAS PARTLY TO GET YOU TO DO SOMETHING I CONCEDED
WHEN HE HAD GONE OFF WITH THE FELLOW I MEAN AND SPENT HOURS WITH HIM HE THEN PREVARICATED ABOUT IT--HE SAID HE HADN'T HER ASSENT WAS CLEAR ENOUGH TO CAUSE ME TO ADD IN A MOMENT
THEY'RE SEEN ONLY ACROSS AS IT WERE AND BEYOND--IN STRANGE PLACES AND ON HIGH PLACES THE TOP OF TOWERS THE ROOF OF HOUSES THE OUTSIDE OF WINDOWS THE FURTHER EDGE OF POOLS
FOR THE FIRST MINUTE SINCE HIS ARRIVAL I WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM HIM
AND ALL THE REST I FAIRLY HELD MY BREATH A MINUTE AND EVEN FROM MY GLIMMERING TAPER THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO SHOW HOW HE SMILED UP AT ME FROM HIS PILLOW
BUT AREN'T THEY ALL SENT HOME--YES
NEVER AGAIN TO SO MUCH AS LOOK AT YOU SO THAT WHAT YOU'VE COME TO ME NOW FOR I ASKED IS TO SPEED ME ON MY WAY BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO REPLY HOWEVER I HAD HER IN CHECK
HE KNEW ME AS WELL AS I KNEW HIM
THE FIRST THE VERY FIRST
THERE BEAT IN ME INDEED WITH THE PASSIONATE THROB OF THIS QUESTION AN EQUAL DUMB APPEAL AS TO HOW THE DEUCE I SHOULD
THE PRESENCE ON THE LAWN--I FELT SICK AS I MADE IT OUT--WAS POOR LITTLE MILES HIMSELF
YOU MISS BY WRITING TO HIM THAT HIS HOUSE IS POISONED AND HIS LITTLE NEPHEW AND NIECE MAD BUT IF THEY ARE MISS AND IF I AM MYSELF YOU MEAN
SO WE CIRCLED ABOUT WITH TERRORS AND SCRUPLES LIKE FIGHTERS NOT DARING TO CLOSE
WELL OLD LADY IS THERE NOTHING--NOTHING AT ALL THAT YOU WANT TO TELL ME HE TURNED OFF A LITTLE FACING ROUND TOWARD THE WALL AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND TO LOOK AT AS ONE HAD SEEN SICK CHILDREN LOOK
HE STOLE I TURNED IT OVER--I TRIED TO BE MORE JUDICIAL
THE SCENE HAD A GREATNESS THAT MADE IT A DIFFERENT AFFAIR FROM MY OWN SCANT HOME AND THERE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED AT THE DOOR WITH A LITTLE GIRL IN HER HAND A CIVIL PERSON WHO DROPPED ME AS DECENT A CURTSY AS IF I HAD BEEN THE MISTRESS OR A DISTINGUISHED VISITOR
HE HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED WHEN ON MY WAY DOWN I PUSHED OPEN HIS DOOR AND I LEARNED BELOW THAT HE HAD BREAKFASTED--IN THE PRESENCE OF A COUPLE OF THE MAIDS--WITH MRS GROSE AND HIS SISTER
AND THAT WOULD OPEN UP THE WHOLE THING
WITH NO COUNSEL TO TAKE THE NEXT DAY I WAS FULL OF DISTRESS
IT WAS A SHARP TRAP FOR THE INSCRUTABLE
SHE WAS TO GET UP AND LOOK OUT WHICH IS WHAT SHE DID DO IT WAS I WHO FELL INTO THE TRAP
AS IF AT THIS MOMENT TO SHOW ME EXACTLY WHAT HIS RANGE HAD BEEN MRS GROSE AS I HAD DONE FOR HIMSELF JUST BEFORE CAME IN FROM THE HALL
THEY LOOK PARTICULARLY ARCHED AND AS IF THEY MIGHT MOVE A GOOD DEAL
IT CAME TO ME STRAIGHTWAY UNDER HER CONTACT THAT WITH PLAIN HEARTINESS MERE RELIEVED ANXIETY AT MY APPEARANCE SHE KNEW NOTHING WHATEVER THAT COULD BEAR UPON THE INCIDENT I HAD THERE READY FOR HER
DREADFUL WELL I SAID I'VE BEEN FRIGHTENED MRS GROSE'S EYES EXPRESSED PLAINLY THAT SHE HAD NO WISH TO BE YET ALSO THAT SHE KNEW TOO WELL HER PLACE NOT TO BE READY TO SHARE WITH ME ANY MARKED INCONVENIENCE
DO YOU MEAN SHE SPOKE IT CAME TO THAT
YOU MUST TELL ME NOW--AND ALL THE TRUTH
NOTHING NOTHING HE SADLY REPEATED
BUT HE HAD ALREADY JERKED STRAIGHT ROUND STARED GLARED AGAIN AND SEEN BUT THE QUIET DAY
IT HAD BEEN PROMPTLY GIVEN ME I HAVE NOTED TO FACE THAT MYSTERY WITHOUT A PANG
AND IT'S A WONDER I'M NOT
I FOUND NO SOUND ON MY LIPS TO PRESS IT AND I WAS AWARE OF REPLYING ONLY WITH A VAGUE REPEATED GRIMACING NOD
WE HAD BEEN COLLECTIVELY SUBJECT TO AN INTRUSION
WHY WHERE ARE YOUR THINGS WHERE YOURS ARE MY DEAR I PROMPTLY RETURNED
WELL EVEN AS IT WAS I PERHAPS MIGHT HELP
HE SAT DOWN AT THE OLD PIANO AND PLAYED AS HE HAD NEVER PLAYED
YOU KNOW MY DEAR THAT FOR A FELLOW TO BE WITH A LADY ALWAYS HIS MY DEAR WAS CONSTANTLY ON HIS LIPS FOR ME AND NOTHING COULD HAVE EXPRESSED MORE THE EXACT SHADE OF THE SENTIMENT WITH WHICH I DESIRED TO INSPIRE MY PUPILS THAN ITS FOND FAMILIARITY
TO PLAY WITH HIM I MEAN--TO SPOIL HIM SHE PAUSED A MOMENT
ON THE ELEVENTH NIGHT AFTER MY LATEST ENCOUNTER WITH THAT GENTLEMAN--THEY WERE ALL NUMBERED NOW--I HAD AN ALARM THAT PERILOUSLY SKIRTED IT AND THAT INDEED FROM THE PARTICULAR QUALITY OF ITS UNEXPECTEDNESS PROVED QUITE MY SHARPEST SHOCK
IF I HAD EVER DOUBTED ALL MY DOUBT WOULD AT PRESENT HAVE GONE
AND WHAT DID THE FORMER GOVERNESS DIE OF?--OF SO MUCH RESPECTABILITY OUR FRIEND'S ANSWER WAS PROMPT
BUT FOR WHAT FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THE EVIL THAT IN THOSE DREADFUL DAYS THE PAIR PUT INTO THEM
MRS GROSE AND FLORA HAD PASSED INTO THE CHURCH THE OTHER WORSHIPPERS HAD FOLLOWED AND WE WERE FOR THE MINUTE ALONE AMONG THE OLD THICK GRAVES
SHE HAS TAKEN THE BOAT MY COMPANION STARED AT THE VACANT MOORING PLACE AND THEN AGAIN ACROSS THE LAKE
LONDON WILL SET HER UP
I MYSELF HAD KEPT BACK NOTHING BUT THERE WAS A WORD MRS GROSE HAD KEPT BACK
HIS EYEBROWS ARE SOMEHOW DARKER
AT THAT MOMENT IN THE STATE OF MY NERVES I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVED SHE LIED
I REFLECTED HUNGRILY THAT FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR HE WOULD HAVE TO BE SILENT
BUT HE WAS SO MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN I THAT LAUGHING OUT THROUGH HIS GRAVITY HE COULD PRETEND WE WERE PLEASANTLY JESTING
AND ON THIS I CAUGHT MY BREATH WITH ALL THE TERROR THAT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE I HAD BEEN ABLE TO RESIST
BUT IT HAS ONLY MADE ME MORE LUCID MADE ME GET HOLD OF STILL OTHER THINGS MY LUCIDITY MUST HAVE SEEMED AWFUL BUT THE CHARMING CREATURES WHO WERE VICTIMS OF IT PASSING AND REPASSING IN THEIR INTERLOCKED SWEETNESS GAVE MY COLLEAGUE SOMETHING TO HOLD ON BY
SHE DROPPED WITH A SUDDEN SOB UPON MY SOFA AND AS I HAD SEEN HER DO BEFORE GAVE WAY TO ALL THE GRIEF OF IT
YOU MEAN YOU'RE AFRAID OF SEEING HER AGAIN OH NO
I HAVE NOT SEEN BLY SINCE THE DAY I LEFT IT AND I DARESAY THAT TO MY OLDER AND MORE INFORMED EYES IT WOULD NOW APPEAR SUFFICIENTLY CONTRACTED
IF HE HAD BEEN WICKED HE WOULD HAVE CAUGHT IT AND I SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT IT BY THE REBOUND--I SHOULD HAVE FOUND THE TRACE
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TRACEABLE THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF MY PREDICAMENT AND THAT THIS STRANGE RELATION MADE IN A MANNER FOR A LONG TIME THE AIR IN WHICH WE MOVED
YES YOU'RE GETTING ON OH BUT I FELT HELPLESS
I SAW IT AND SHE SAW I SAW IT
THE APPEARANCE WAS FULL UPON US THAT I HAD ALREADY HAD TO DEAL WITH HERE
YET IF I HAD NOT INDULGED TO PROVE THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT IN THIS REVIEW I SHOULD HAVE MISSED THE TWO OR THREE DIM ELEMENTS OF COMFORT THAT STILL REMAINED TO ME
MRS GROSE WAS AWARE I COULD JUDGE OF WHAT SHE HAD PRODUCED IN ME AND SHE FOLLOWED IT UP WITH ASSURANCE
THE RAIN HAPPILY STOPPED AND I PREPARED FOR OUR WALK WHICH THROUGH THE PARK AND BY THE GOOD ROAD TO THE VILLAGE WOULD BE A MATTER OF TWENTY MINUTES
FOR IT STRIKES ME YOU NEVER TELL ME
OH IT WAS A TRAP--NOT DESIGNED BUT DEEP--TO MY IMAGINATION TO MY DELICACY PERHAPS TO MY VANITY
WOULD IT BE SO GREAT IF HE WERE REALLY GOING TO TELL ME
IT HAS BEEN EASY TO LIVE WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE SIMPLY LEADING A LIFE OF THEIR OWN
A SILENCE THAT HOWEVER I WOULD ENGAGE TO BREAK DOWN ON THE FIRST PRIVATE OPPORTUNITY
BUT--YES--WITH EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTY I NOW RECOGNIZED TO WHAT I HAD AT LAST STROKE BY STROKE BROUGHT THE VICTIM OF MY CONFIDENCE FOR SHE QUITE VISIBLY WEIGHED THIS
SO THAT EVEN NOW AS SHE BRAVELY BLINKED UNDER THE SIGNAL OF MY WORD I COULD KEEP HER COMPARATIVELY FIRM
INSTEAD OF IT EVEN--AS A WOMAN READS ANOTHER--SHE COULD SEE WHAT I MYSELF SAW
AND YET--AND YET THERE WERE TOO MANY THINGS
YOU MEAN THAT--TO BE LET ALONE YOURSELF AND NOT FOLLOWED UP--YOU'LL CEASE TO WORRY AND SPY UPON ME WON'T KEEP ME SO CLOSE TO YOU WILL LET ME GO AND COME
I REMEMBER THAT THE BOOK I HAD IN MY HAND WAS FIELDING'S AMELIA
THEY WERE LIKE THE CHERUBS OF THE ANECDOTE WHO HAD--MORALLY AT ANY RATE--NOTHING TO WHACK
THAT WAS WHAT REPEATEDLY I DIPPED INTO MY ROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR TO SAY TO MYSELF
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT BY THE TIME I REACHED THE HOUSE I HAD MADE UP MY MIND I WOULD FLY
DON'T YOU INSTEAD OF ANSWERING SHE CAME NEARER TO THE WINDOW AND FOR A MINUTE APPLIED HER FACE TO THE GLASS
ONCE MORE AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE HE LOOKED UP AT THE DIM DAY AS IF OF WHAT HAD HITHERTO SUSTAINED HIM NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT AN UNSPEAKABLE ANXIETY
WHY ALL THAT WE KNOW--AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT ELSE BESIDES THEN AS SHE RELEASED ME I MADE IT OUT TO HER MADE IT OUT PERHAPS ONLY NOW WITH FULL COHERENCY EVEN TO MYSELF
YET WHEN HE AT LAST ARRIVED THE DIFFICULTY OF APPLYING THEM THE ACCUMULATIONS OF MY PROBLEM WERE BROUGHT STRAIGHT HOME TO ME BY THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PRESENCE ON WHICH WHAT HAD OCCURRED HAD AS YET FOR THE EYE DROPPED NEITHER STAIN NOR SHADOW
AND I FELT IT TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE DESIRE SHE PRESENTLY SHOWED TO KNOW MORE
HE KNOWS DOWN TO THE GROUND WHAT HE MIGHT DO
I MADE IN MY BEWILDERMENT FOR THE SCHOOLROOM WHERE THERE WERE OBJECTS BELONGING TO ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE
ALSO THAT I WAS WHOLLY AWAKE
I HELD HER HARD A LITTLE LIKING TO FEEL HER CLOSE TO ME
THEY WERE SOMEHOW SIMPLY AFRAID
WHAT MY FRIEND HAD HAD IN MIND PROVED TO BE IMMENSELY TO THE PURPOSE
I TOOK THIS AS A DIRECT DISPROOF OF HIS HAVING REALLY BEEN CHASTISED
THIS HAD BECOME THOROUGHLY HER ATTITUDE BY THE TIME THAT IN MY RECITAL OF THE EVENTS OF THE NIGHT I REACHED THE POINT OF WHAT MILES HAD SAID TO ME WHEN AFTER SEEING HIM AT SUCH A MONSTROUS HOUR ALMOST ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE HE HAPPENED NOW TO BE I HAD GONE DOWN TO BRING HIM IN
THE CHANGE WAS ACTUALLY LIKE THE SPRING OF A BEAST
THERE WAS A ROOMFUL OF OLD BOOKS AT BLY--LAST-CENTURY FICTION SOME OF IT WHICH TO THE EXTENT OF A DISTINCTLY DEPRECATED RENOWN BUT NEVER TO SO MUCH AS THAT OF A STRAY SPECIMEN HAD REACHED THE SEQUESTERED HOME AND APPEALED TO THE UNAVOWED CURIOSITY OF MY YOUTH
THEY HAVE THE MANNERS TO BE SILENT AND YOU TRUSTED AS YOU ARE THE BASENESS TO SPEAK I FELT MYSELF CRIMSON AND I COVERED MY FACE WITH MY HANDS
YET I BELIEVE THAT NO WOMAN SO OVERWHELMED EVER IN SO SHORT A TIME RECOVERED HER GRASP OF THE ACT
IT WAS AN IMMENSE HELP TO ME--I CONFESS I RATHER APPLAUD MYSELF AS I LOOK BACK!--THAT I SAW MY SERVICE SO STRONGLY AND SO SIMPLY
WELL MISS--SHE'S GONE
SHE COMMUNED ON THE CONTRARY ON THE SPOT WITH HER UNEASINESS
I HAD SO FAR RATHER YOU SLEPT WELL I THINK ALSO YOU KNOW OF THIS QUEER BUSINESS OF OURS I MARKED THE COOLNESS OF HIS FIRM LITTLE HAND
I DREW A GREAT SECURITY IN THIS PARTICULAR FROM HER MERE SMOOTH ASPECT
MAKE HIM AT ANY RATE COME TO YOU I STARED
BUT IT ISN'T SO MUCH THAT WHAT IS IT THEN WELL--I WANT TO SEE MORE LIFE I SEE
AND THIS ASTONISHED ME TOO I RECOLLECT REMAINED WITH ME ADDING TO MY SENSE OF THE LIBERALITY WITH WHICH I WAS TREATED
IS SHE HERE MILES PANTED AS HE CAUGHT WITH HIS SEALED EYES THE DIRECTION OF MY WORDS
YOU THOUGHT I MIGHT BE WALKING IN THE GROUNDS WELL YOU KNOW I THOUGHT SOMEONE WAS"--SHE NEVER BLANCHED AS SHE SMILED OUT THAT AT ME
REALLY SHOCKING AND ABOUT ME ABOUT YOU MISS--SINCE YOU MUST HAVE IT
WELL WHAT ARE YOU UP TO HE ASKED WITH A GRACE OF SOCIABILITY IN WHICH IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT MRS GROSE HAD SHE BEEN PRESENT MIGHT HAVE LOOKED IN VAIN FOR PROOF THAT ANYTHING WAS OUT I STOOD OVER HIM WITH MY CANDLE
HE HAD MADE THE WHOLE CHARGE ABSURD
THEREFORE YOU CAN FANCY HOW MUCH I'M IN THE DARK
IT WAS AS A WILD PROTEST AGAINST IT THAT ACTUALLY ADDRESSING HER--"YOU TERRIBLE MISERABLE WOMAN!"--I HEARD MYSELF BREAK INTO A SOUND THAT BY THE OPEN DOOR RANG THROUGH THE LONG PASSAGE AND THE EMPTY HOUSE
I GOT UP AND LOOKED A MOMENT THROUGH THE TWILIGHT AT THE GRAY POOL AND ITS BLANK HAUNTED EDGE AND THEN I TOOK BACK TO THE HOUSE MY DREARY AND DIFFICULT COURSE
I WAS BY THIS TIME--IF I CAN PUT THE WHOLE THING AT ALL TOGETHER--MORE APPALLED AT WHAT I MAY PROPERLY CALL HER MANNER THAN AT ANYTHING ELSE THOUGH IT WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THIS THAT I BECAME AWARE OF HAVING MRS GROSE ALSO AND VERY FORMIDABLY TO RECKON WITH
BUT AN EXTRAORDINARY IMPRESSION DROPPED ON ME AS I EXTRACTED A MEANING FROM THE BOY'S EMBARRASSED BACK--NONE OTHER THAN THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS NOT BARRED NOW
BUT TO WHAT TO EVERYTHING AND WHAT DO YOU CALL EVERYTHING WHY SENDING FOR THEIR UNCLE OH MISS IN PITY DO MY FRIEND BROKE OUT
THERE WAS AN EFFORT IN THE WAY THAT WHILE HER ARMS RESTED ON THE TABLE HER HANDS WITH EVIDENT WEARINESS SUPPORTED HER HEAD
YOU LEAVE HIM SO LONG WITH QUINT
SHE THINKS SHE'LL DO IT THIS TIME--BUT SHE WON'T TO DO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO INDULGE FOR INSTANCE--AND FOR ONCE IN A WAY--IN SOME DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE LADY WHO HAD PREPARED THEM FOR MY DISCIPLINE
WELL HE SAID AT LAST JUST EXACTLY IN ORDER THAT YOU SHOULD DO THIS DO WHAT THINK ME--FOR A CHANGE--BAD I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE SWEETNESS AND GAIETY WITH WHICH HE BROUGHT OUT THE WORD NOR HOW ON TOP OF IT HE BENT FORWARD AND KISSED ME
IV IT WAS NOT THAT I DIDN'T WAIT ON THIS OCCASION FOR MORE FOR I WAS ROOTED AS DEEPLY AS I WAS SHAKEN
MY DEAR CHILD HOW CAN I HELP MINDING
YES--I DON'T MIND THAT NOW SHE ALWAYS ENDED AT THESE MOMENTS BY GETTING POSSESSION OF MY HAND AND IN THIS MANNER SHE COULD AT PRESENT STILL STAY ME
SHE ONLY FIXED THE CHILD MRS GROSE TRIED TO SEE IT
BUT I THOUGHT IT AFTER AN INSTANT NOT OPPOSED TO THIS CONCESSION TO PURSUE
THESE THREE WORDS FROM HER WERE IN A FLASH LIKE THE GLITTER OF A DRAWN BLADE THE JOSTLE OF THE CUP THAT MY HAND FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS HAD HELD HIGH AND FULL TO THE BRIM THAT NOW EVEN BEFORE SPEAKING I FELT OVERFLOW IN A DELUGE
YOU REMINDED HIM THAT QUINT WAS ONLY A BASE MENIAL AS YOU MIGHT SAY
NOT HALF I WANT TO MILES HONESTLY PROFESSED
IT WAS PRACTICALLY THE END OF EVERYTHING
BY GOING ALL THE WAY ROUND CERTAINLY FAR AS IT IS
WHAT IF I SHOULD GO STRAIGHT IN AND MARCH TO HIS WINDOW?--WHAT IF BY RISKING TO HIS BOYISH BEWILDERMENT A REVELATION OF MY MOTIVE I SHOULD THROW ACROSS THE REST OF THE MYSTERY THE LONG HALTER OF MY BOLDNESS
AND IF HE'S SAVED THEN YOU ARE THE DEAR WOMAN KISSED ME ON THIS AND I TOOK HER FAREWELL
OF SOMETHING MUCH WORSE WORSE THAN DISLIKE?--THIS LEFT HER INDEED AT A LOSS
YES MISS I WOULD LEAVE ON THE SPOT BOTH HIM AND YOU XIII IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO JOIN THEM BUT SPEAKING TO THEM PROVED QUITE AS MUCH AS EVER AN EFFORT BEYOND MY STRENGTH--OFFERED IN CLOSE QUARTERS DIFFICULTIES AS INSURMOUNTABLE AS BEFORE
BUT I TOOK IN THE WHOLE SCENE--I GAVE HIM TIME TO REAPPEAR
WAS IT FOR THAT YOU MIGHTN'T GO BACK THE ONLY THING HE FELT WAS RATHER A DREARY LITTLE SURPRISE
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO PREVENT AN ACCEPTANCE OF MY COMPANION'S OWN MEASURE OF MY PREDECESSOR'S ABASEMENT
I WON'T TELL TALES I QUITE UNDERSTAND YOUR FEELING I HASTENED TO REPLY
HE DID STAND THERE!--BUT HIGH UP BEYOND THE LAWN AND AT THE VERY TOP OF THE TOWER TO WHICH ON THAT FIRST MORNING LITTLE FLORA HAD CONDUCTED ME
I'VE HEARD HEARD FROM THAT CHILD--HORRORS
ALL THE MORE THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME I COULD SEE IN THE ASPECT OF OTHERS A CONFUSED REFLECTION OF THE CRISIS
I DARESAY I FANCIED MYSELF IN SHORT A REMARKABLE YOUNG WOMAN AND TOOK COMFORT IN THE FAITH THAT THIS WOULD MORE PUBLICLY APPEAR
I THINK YOU'RE CRUEL
I RESERVE THIS DISTINCTION FOR QUITE ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE
I CAN'T WAIT TO DRESS I CRIED AND IF YOU MUST DO SO I LEAVE YOU
NO FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T
TO WATCH FROM MY OPEN WINDOW THE FAINT SUMMER DAWN TO LOOK AT SUCH PORTIONS OF THE REST OF THE HOUSE AS I COULD CATCH AND TO LISTEN WHILE IN THE FADING DUSK THE FIRST BIRDS BEGAN TO TWITTER FOR THE POSSIBLE RECURRENCE OF A SOUND OR TWO LESS NATURAL AND NOT WITHOUT BUT WITHIN THAT I HAD FANCIED I HEARD
IN ANSWER TO THE LETTER I HAD MADE UP MY MIND
IT CAME TO ME IN THE VERY HORROR OF THE IMMEDIATE PRESENCE THAT THE ACT WOULD BE SEEING AND FACING WHAT I SAW AND FACED TO KEEP THE BOY HIMSELF UNAWARE
AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN AS THE RESEMBLANCE CAME TO ME ALL I POSSESSED ON EARTH REALLY TO BE THE NURSE OR THE SISTER OF CHARITY WHO MIGHT HAVE HELPED TO CURE HIM
I WAS SURE
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN STANDING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AND RAISING HIS EYES TO SOME FAINT GREEN TWILIGHT
HE WAS DISCERNIBLY TRYING TO TAKE FOR GRANTED MORE THINGS THAN HE FOUND WITHOUT ASSISTANCE QUITE EASY
HOW LONG WAS HE HERE TILL I CAME OUT
YOU TOOK THE THING DOWN NOTHING BUT THE IMPRESSION
HOW OTHERWISE SHOULD I HAVE BEEN BAD ENOUGH HE ASKED
I DON'T--I DON'T
LUKE WILL TAKE IT I SAID AS I CAME BACK
IT WAS QUITE IN ANOTHER MANNER THAT I FOR MY PART LET MYSELF GO
MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH SHEETS OF WATER WAS SMALL AND THE POOL OF BLY AT ALL EVENTS ON THE FEW OCCASIONS OF MY CONSENTING UNDER THE PROTECTION OF MY PUPILS TO AFFRONT ITS SURFACE IN THE OLD FLAT-BOTTOMED BOAT MOORED THERE FOR OUR USE HAD IMPRESSED ME BOTH WITH ITS EXTENT AND ITS AGITATION
HE GIVES ME A SORT OF SENSE OF LOOKING LIKE AN ACTOR AN ACTOR IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESEMBLE ONE LESS AT LEAST THAN MRS GROSE AT THAT MOMENT
I SAW NEITHER OF THEM ON MY RETURN BUT ON THE OTHER HAND AS BY AN AMBIGUOUS COMPENSATION I SAW A GREAT DEAL OF MILES
IT WAS SERIOUS NOW--THE FLICKER HAD LEFT IT
I COULD ONLY GET ON AT ALL BY TAKING NATURE INTO MY CONFIDENCE AND MY ACCOUNT BY TREATING MY MONSTROUS ORDEAL AS A PUSH IN A DIRECTION UNUSUAL OF COURSE AND UNPLEASANT BUT DEMANDING AFTER ALL FOR A FAIR FRONT ONLY ANOTHER TURN OF THE SCREW OF ORDINARY HUMAN VIRTUE
AND I DARE SAY THAT TO BEAR UP AT ALL I BECAME THAT MORNING VERY GRAND AND VERY DRY
I RECALL FURTHER BOTH A GENERAL CONVICTION THAT IT WAS HORRIBLY LATE AND A PARTICULAR OBJECTION TO LOOKING AT MY WATCH
I HAD ALWAYS MY HYPOCRISY OF WORK BEHIND WHICH NOW I GAINED THE SOFA
FORBIDDEN GROUND WAS THE QUESTION OF THE RETURN OF THE DEAD IN GENERAL AND OF WHATEVER IN ESPECIAL MIGHT SURVIVE IN MEMORY OF THE FRIENDS LITTLE CHILDREN HAD LOST
SO I SAW HIM AS I SEE THE LETTERS I FORM ON THIS PAGE
WELL IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHO HE WAS SHE WAS TEN YEARS OLDER SAID HER HUSBAND
HE WAS ADMIRABLE BUT NOT COMFORTABLE
OF COURSE YOU KNOW A LOT BUT YOU HINT THAT YOU KNOW ALMOST AS MUCH I RISKED AS HE PAUSED
WOULD EXASPERATION HOWEVER IF RELIEF HAD LONGER BEEN POSTPONED FINALLY HAVE BETRAYED ME
THE GLOVES HAD BEEN DROPPED THERE AND I TURNED IN TO RECOVER THEM
AND AFTERWARD I IMAGINED--AND I STILL IMAGINE
SHE WAS STRUCK WITH OUR BAREHEADED ASPECT
AS MATTERS STOOD HOWEVER I COULD FEEL HER WHEN SHE SURVEYED THEM WITH HER LARGE WHITE ARMS FOLDED AND THE HABIT OF SERENITY IN ALL HER LOOK THANK THE LORD'S MERCY THAT IF THEY WERE RUINED THE PIECES WOULD STILL SERVE
WE'LL SEE IT OUT WE'LL SEE IT OUT I ARDENTLY ECHOED GIVING HER MY HAND TO MAKE IT A VOW
THEY WERE BOTH INFAMOUS SHE FINALLY SAID
YOU'RE GOING TO THE WATER MISS?--YOU THINK SHE'S IN SHE MAY BE THOUGH THE DEPTH IS I BELIEVE NOWHERE VERY GREAT
THAT KIND OF MEASURE MUST HAVE LEFT ME
SHE TURNED HER EYES TO THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE AS IF THE QUESTION WERE AS IRRELEVANT OR AT ANY RATE AS IMPERSONAL AS MRS MARCET OR NINE-TIMES-NINE
I PRETERNATURALLY LISTENED
WAS SHE CAREFUL--PARTICULAR MRS GROSE APPEARED TO TRY TO BE CONSCIENTIOUS
THEN AT LAST RAISING THEM TELL ME HOW YOU KNOW SHE SAID
BUT IF HE PUT THE INFERENCE BY WITHOUT A SMILE IT WAS ALSO WITHOUT IRRITATION
HE HAS NO HAT THEN SEEING IN HER FACE THAT SHE ALREADY IN THIS WITH A DEEPER DISMAY FOUND A TOUCH OF PICTURE I QUICKLY ADDED STROKE TO STROKE
BUT I MUST GO BACK I KEPT HER HOWEVER
I CAN'T SAY HOW LONG I TURNED IT OVER OR HOW LONG IN A CONFUSION OF CURIOSITY AND DREAD I REMAINED WHERE I HAD HAD MY COLLISION
IF QUINT--ON YOUR REMONSTRANCE AT THE TIME YOU SPEAK OF--WAS A BASE MENIAL ONE OF THE THINGS MILES SAID TO YOU I FIND MYSELF GUESSING WAS THAT YOU WERE ANOTHER AGAIN HER ADMISSION WAS SO ADEQUATE THAT I CONTINUED
WHEN LATER BY THE SCHOOLROOM FIRE I WAS SERVED WITH TEA BY THE USUAL MAID I INDULGED ON THE ARTICLE OF MY OTHER PUPIL IN NO INQUIRY WHATEVER
MISS JESSEL--WAS INFAMOUS SHE ONCE MORE TOOK MY HAND IN BOTH HER OWN HOLDING IT AS TIGHT AS IF TO FORTIFY ME AGAINST THE INCREASE OF ALARM I MIGHT DRAW FROM THIS DISCLOSURE
I ASSURE YOU MISS I DO NOTHING ELSE
SOMETIMES INDEED WHEN I DROPPED INTO COARSENESS I PERHAPS CAME ACROSS TRACES OF LITTLE UNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN THEM BY WHICH ONE OF THEM SHOULD KEEP ME OCCUPIED WHILE THE OTHER SLIPPED AWAY
THAT WAS EXACTLY PRESENT TO ME--BY WHICH I MEAN THE FACE WAS--WHEN ON THE FIRST OF THESE OCCASIONS AT THE END OF A LONG JUNE DAY I STOPPED SHORT ON EMERGING FROM ONE OF THE PLANTATIONS AND COMING INTO VIEW OF THE HOUSE
AND I FELT HOW TIGHT SHE HELD AS WITHOUT STIRRING IN THE BREATH OF MY PASSION SHE COVERED THEM STILL WITH HER EYES
IT'S BEYOND EVERYTHING FOR A YOUNG LADY
THE CHILD'S DISMISSED HIS SCHOOL SHE GAVE ME A LOOK THAT I REMARKED AT THE MOMENT
HIS MOUTH'S WIDE AND HIS LIPS ARE THIN AND EXCEPT FOR HIS LITTLE WHISKERS HE'S QUITE CLEAN-SHAVEN
HE WAS SOON AT SOME DISTANCE FROM ME STILL BREATHING HARD AND AGAIN WITH THE AIR THOUGH NOW WITHOUT ANGER FOR IT OF BEING CONFINED AGAINST HIS WILL
I WAS THERE WITH THE CHILD--QUIET FOR THE HOUR
NO MORE NO MORE NO MORE I SHRIEKED AS I TRIED TO PRESS HIM AGAINST ME TO MY VISITANT
I HAD RECEIVED IN HARLEY STREET A NARROWER NOTION OF THE PLACE AND THAT AS I RECALLED IT MADE ME THINK THE PROPRIETOR STILL MORE OF A GENTLEMAN SUGGESTED THAT WHAT I WAS TO ENJOY MIGHT BE SOMETHING BEYOND HIS PROMISE
FOR AT THE END OF A TIME THAT UNDER HIS INFLUENCE I HAD QUITE CEASED TO MEASURE I STARTED UP WITH A STRANGE SENSE OF HAVING LITERALLY SLEPT AT MY POST
MY FEAR WAS OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE INTOLERABLE QUESTION OF THE GROUNDS OF HIS DISMISSAL FROM SCHOOL FOR THAT WAS REALLY BUT THE QUESTION OF THE HORRORS GATHERED BEHIND
WELL HE DIDN'T SHOW ANYTHING
I HAVE MY DUTY SO HAVE I MINE SHE REPLIED
YES--SHE WAS A LADY AND HE SO DREADFULLY BELOW SAID MRS GROSE
IT WAS LITERALLY A CHARMING EXHIBITION OF TACT OF MAGNANIMITY AND QUITE TANTAMOUNT TO HIS SAYING OUTRIGHT
AND WE HAD IN HER OFF-HOURS SOME STROLLS AND TALKS IN THE GARDEN--TALKS IN WHICH SHE STRUCK ME AS AWFULLY CLEVER AND NICE
WHICH AS HE FACED TOWARD THE CLEAR WINDOW I SUFFERED FEELING THAT I HAD NOTHING NOW THERE TO KEEP HIM FROM
TO CHECK THE IRRELEVANT GAZE AND DISCOURAGED SIGH IN WHICH I CONSTANTLY BOTH ATTACKED AND RENOUNCED THE ENIGMA OF WHAT SUCH A LITTLE GENTLEMAN COULD HAVE DONE THAT DESERVED A PENALTY
HE APPEARED THUS AGAIN WITH I WON'T SAY GREATER DISTINCTNESS FOR THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT WITH A NEARNESS THAT REPRESENTED A FORWARD STRIDE IN OUR INTERCOURSE AND MADE ME AS I MET HIM CATCH MY BREATH AND TURN COLD
THAT YOU JUST WANT ME NOT TO WORRY YOU HE LOOKED ROUND AT ME NOW AS IF IN RECOGNITION OF MY UNDERSTANDING HIM
I HAD THEN EXPRESSED WHAT WAS VIVIDLY IN MY MIND
THEN FALTERING IN THE ACT AND FOLDING IT UP ONCE MORE I PUT IT BACK IN MY POCKET
WELL I SUPPOSE I OUGHTN'T BUT TO WHOM DID YOU SAY THEM HE EVIDENTLY TRIED TO REMEMBER BUT IT DROPPED--HE HAD LOST IT
THIS EVENING YOU SEE I PURSUED HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IN HE ONLY PEEPS I HOPE IT WILL BE CONFINED TO THAT SHE HAD NOW LET GO MY HAND
IT HAD NEITHER BAD NAME NOR ILL FAME AND MRS GROSE MOST APPARENTLY ONLY DESIRED TO CLING TO ME AND TO QUAKE IN SILENCE
I REMEMBER THE LAWN AND THE BRIGHT FLOWERS AND THE CRUNCH OF MY WHEELS ON THE GRAVEL AND THE CLUSTERED TREETOPS OVER WHICH THE ROOKS CIRCLED AND CAWED IN THE GOLDEN SKY
THEN I'LL STAND BY YOU
TO HOLD HER PERFECTLY IN THE PINCH OF THAT I FOUND I HAD ONLY TO ASK HER HOW IF I HAD MADE IT UP I CAME TO BE ABLE TO GIVE OF EACH OF THE PERSONS APPEARING TO ME A PICTURE DISCLOSING TO THE LAST DETAIL THEIR SPECIAL MARKS--A PORTRAIT ON THE EXHIBITION OF WHICH SHE HAD INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED AND NAMED THEM
A CATASTROPHE EXPLAINED--SUPERFICIALLY AT LEAST--BY A VISIBLE WOUND TO HIS HEAD
THE BOY TO MY DEEP DISCOMPOSURE WAS IMMENSELY IN THE RIGHT WAS IN A POSITION TO SAY TO ME
SHE FORBORE TO ASK ME WHAT THIS MEANING MIGHT BE
I DIDN'T TELL YOU BUT I MADE SURE SHE BREATHED A VAGUE RELIEF
I'VE INTERFERED AND YOU'VE SEEN--UNDER HER DICTATION"--WITH WHICH I FACED OVER THE POOL AGAIN OUR INFERNAL WITNESS--"THE EASY AND PERFECT WAY TO MEET IT
HE REMAINED BUT A FEW SECONDS--LONG ENOUGH TO CONVINCE ME HE ALSO SAW AND RECOGNIZED
I THINK INDEED MISS SHE NEVER WILL
THEY'RE THE MASTER'S I CAUGHT IT UP
I CAN'T BEGIN
I WAS CONFRONTED AT LAST AS NEVER YET WITH ALL THE RISK ATTACHED EVEN NOW TO SOUNDING MY OWN HORRID NOTE
THEN SHE GRANTED MY POINT WITH A FRANKNESS WHICH I MADE SURE HAD MORE BEHIND IT
BUT A FIGURE OF QUITE AS UNMISTAKABLE HORROR AND EVIL
JUST WHAT YOU SAW FROM THE DINING ROOM A MINUTE AGO WAS THE EFFECT OF THAT
WHAT WAS PRODIGIOUS WAS THAT AT LAST BY MY SUCCESS HIS SENSE WAS SEALED AND HIS COMMUNICATION STOPPED
THEY MUSTN'T BEFORE SHE GOES SEE EACH OTHER FOR THREE SECONDS THEN IT CAME OVER ME THAT IN SPITE OF FLORA'S PRESUMABLE SEQUESTRATION FROM THE INSTANT OF HER RETURN FROM THE POOL IT MIGHT ALREADY BE TOO LATE
SO THAT I HAD BEEN AWAITING HIM IN THE PONDEROUS POMP OF THE ROOM OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW OF WHICH I HAD HAD FROM MRS GROSE THAT FIRST SCARED SUNDAY MY FLASH OF SOMETHING IT WOULD SCARCE HAVE DONE TO CALL LIGHT
HIS SISTER ON THE CONTRARY HAD BEEN ALERT TO COME OUT AND I STROLLED WITH HER HALF AN HOUR SEEKING THE SHADE FOR THE SUN WAS STILL HIGH AND THE DAY EXCEPTIONALLY WARM
IT HAS MADE HER EVERY INCH OF HER QUITE OLD OH I SEE HER PERFECTLY FROM HERE
WHY MY DEAR HOW DO I KNOW?"--BREAKING MOREOVER INTO A HAPPY LAUGH WHICH IMMEDIATELY AFTER AS IF IT WERE A VOCAL ACCOMPANIMENT HE PROLONGED INTO INCOHERENT EXTRAVAGANT SONG
TO MARK FOR THE HOUSE THE HIGH STATE I CULTIVATED I DECREED THAT MY MEALS WITH THE BOY SHOULD BE SERVED AS WE CALLED IT DOWNSTAIRS
SHE WAS THERE AND I WAS NEITHER CRUEL NOR MAD
SHE STOOD THERE IN SO MUCH OF HER CANDOR AND SO LITTLE OF HER NIGHTGOWN WITH HER PINK BARE FEET AND THE GOLDEN GLOW OF HER CURLS
THIS WAS JUST THE MOMENT TO SEIZE
THEY WERE IN YOUR CHARGE NO THEY WERE NOT IN MINE SHE ROUNDLY AND DISTRESSFULLY RETURNED
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF THE TURN OF THE SCREW BY HENRY JAMES
FOR DREADFUL--DREADFULNESS OH HOW DELICIOUS CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN
HE'LL MEET ME--HE'LL CONFESS
BUT I HAVE AT LEAST REACHED THE HEART OF IT AND THE STRAIGHTEST ROAD OUT IS DOUBTLESS TO ADVANCE
IT WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BEEN HOWEVER A GREATER TENSION STILL HAD IT NOT BEEN SO FREQUENTLY SUCCESSFUL
WHAT I THEN AND THERE TOOK HIM TO MY HEART FOR WAS SOMETHING DIVINE THAT I HAVE NEVER FOUND TO THE SAME DEGREE IN ANY CHILD--HIS INDESCRIBABLE LITTLE AIR OF KNOWING NOTHING IN THE WORLD BUT LOVE
IT DRAGGED HER AT MY HEELS EVEN NOW AND WHEN WE HAD GOT HALFWAY ROUND--A DEVIOUS TIRESOME PROCESS ON GROUND MUCH BROKEN AND BY A PATH CHOKED WITH OVERGROWTH--I PAUSED TO GIVE HER BREATH
I WAS SURE MOREOVER BY MORNING THAT THIS WAS NOT FROM A FAILURE OF FRANKNESS BUT BECAUSE ON EVERY SIDE THERE WERE FEARS
THAT CAME OUT--SHE COULDN'T TELL HER STORY WITHOUT ITS COMING OUT
HE WAS TOO CLEVER FOR A BAD GOVERNESS FOR A PARSON'S DAUGHTER TO SPOIL
WHAT WAS IT AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN
WE WERE ON THE EDGE OF THE LAKE AND AS WE HAD LATELY BEGUN GEOGRAPHY THE LAKE WAS THE SEA OF AZOF
I PERCEIVED AN AGITATION OF THE WINDOW BLIND AND THE CHILD DUCKING DOWN EMERGED ROSILY FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF IT
WE HAD GONE OVER AND OVER EVERY FEATURE OF WHAT I HAD SEEN
DID I STEAL I FELT MYSELF REDDEN TO THE ROOTS OF MY HAIR AS WELL AS WONDER IF IT WERE MORE STRANGE TO PUT TO A GENTLEMAN SUCH A QUESTION OR TO SEE HIM TAKE IT WITH ALLOWANCES THAT GAVE THE VERY DISTANCE OF HIS FALL IN THE WORLD
AND I THOUGHT WITH ENVY OF THE COMPARATIVE DUSK OF THE PEW AND OF THE ALMOST SPIRITUAL HELP OF THE HASSOCK ON WHICH I MIGHT BEND MY KNEES
YOU DO KNOW HIM SHE FALTERED BUT A SECOND
YOU WILL I FIXED HIM TOO
BY THE WAY SHE LOOKED AT YOU DO YOU MEAN--SO WICKEDLY DEAR ME NO--I COULD HAVE BORNE THAT
THEY GAVE ME SO LITTLE TROUBLE--THEY WERE OF A GENTLENESS SO EXTRAORDINARY
THEY SAID YOU WOULD LIKE IT BETTER
THEN I BROUGHT OUT
OF WHAT FIRST HAPPENED WHEN I WAS LEFT ALONE I HAD NO SUBSEQUENT MEMORY
IF I MIGHT CONTINUE SURE OF THAT I SHOULD CARE BUT LITTLE WHAT ELSE HAPPENED
I SHOULD NEVER GET TO THE BOTTOM--WERE I TO LET MYSELF GO EVEN NOW--OF THE PRODIGIOUS PRIVATE COMMENTARY ALL UNDER STILL MORE PRIVATE CORRECTION WITH WHICH IN THESE DAYS I OVERSCORED THEIR FULL HOURS
I HAD TOO MUCH FROM THIS MOMENT MY OTHER IDEAS
I PERCEIVED WITHIN HALF AN HOUR THAT SHE WAS SO GLAD--STOUT SIMPLE PLAIN CLEAN WHOLESOME WOMAN--AS TO BE POSITIVELY ON HER GUARD AGAINST SHOWING IT TOO MUCH
THEIR UNCLE MUST DO THE PREVENTING
YOU WERE TOO SWEET TOO--I CAN HEAR YOU ALL
WE EXPECT OF A SMALL CHILD A SCANT ONE BUT THERE WAS IN THIS BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BOY SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARILY SENSITIVE YET EXTRAORDINARILY HAPPY THAT MORE THAN IN ANY CREATURE OF HIS AGE I HAVE SEEN STRUCK ME AS BEGINNING ANEW EACH DAY
THERE HAD BEEN FOR THE TWO CHILDREN AT FIRST A YOUNG LADY WHOM THEY HAD HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO LOSE
HE HAD PICKED UP HIS HAT WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT IN AND STOOD TWIRLING IT IN A WAY THAT GAVE ME EVEN AS I WAS JUST NEARLY REACHING PORT A PERVERSE HORROR OF WHAT I WAS DOING
HE HAD THEN GONE OUT AS HE SAID FOR A STROLL
SHE SEEMED FAIRLY TO SQUARE HERSELF PLANT HERSELF MORE FIRMLY TO UTTER THE WONDER OF IT
AH I HAVEN'T GUESSED SHE SAID VERY SIMPLY
NO NEVER--FROM THE HOUR YOU CAME BACK
I'LL TELL YOU IF YOU'LL TELL ME I HEARD MYSELF SAY THEN HEARD THE TREMOR IN WHICH IT BROKE
DO YOU MEAN NOW--HERE THERE COULDN'T BE A BETTER PLACE OR TIME HE LOOKED ROUND HIM UNEASILY AND I HAD THE RARE--OH THE QUEER!--IMPRESSION OF THE VERY FIRST SYMPTOM I HAD SEEN IN HIM OF THE APPROACH OF IMMEDIATE FEAR
DON'T YOU THEN LOVE OUR SWEET FLORA IF I DIDN'T--AND YOU TOO
SHE COULDN'T HAVE STAYED
I HAD MADE HER A RECEPTACLE OF LURID THINGS BUT THERE WAS AN ODD RECOGNITION OF MY SUPERIORITY--MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND MY FUNCTION--IN HER PATIENCE UNDER MY PAIN
IN GOING ON WITH THE RECORD OF WHAT WAS HIDEOUS AT BLY I NOT ONLY CHALLENGE THE MOST LIBERAL FAITH--FOR WHICH I LITTLE CARE
WHAT I SAID TO MYSELF ABOVE ALL WAS THAT MILES HAD GOT SOMETHING OUT OF ME AND THAT THE PROOF OF IT FOR HIM WOULD BE JUST THIS AWKWARD COLLAPSE
WHEN I REACHED THE GATE IN THE FENCE THE BOAT TO MY SURPRISE WAS GONE SO THAT I HAD A FRESH REFLECTION TO MAKE ON FLORA'S EXTRAORDINARY COMMAND OF THE SITUATION
THERE CAME TO ME THUS A BEWILDERMENT OF VISION OF WHICH AFTER THESE YEARS THERE IS NO LIVING VIEW THAT I CAN HOPE TO GIVE
I MIGHT EASILY PUT AN END TO MY PREDICAMENT BY GETTING AWAY ALTOGETHER
HE COULDN'T PLAY ANY LONGER AT INNOCENCE
IT MAY BE OF COURSE ABOVE ALL THAT WHAT SUDDENLY BROKE INTO THIS GIVES THE PREVIOUS TIME A CHARM OF STILLNESS--THAT HUSH IN WHICH SOMETHING GATHERS OR CROUCHES
SINCE THE LIGHT BRUSH THAT SECOND NIGHT ON THE UPPER LANDING OF THE PRESENCE OF A WOMAN AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIR I HAD SEEN NOTHING WHETHER IN OR OUT OF THE HOUSE THAT ONE HAD BETTER NOT HAVE SEEN
I WANTED NOT TO KNOW
BUT WHAT CAN THEY NOW DO SHE PURSUED
I SAW THEM FILL WITH GOOD TEARS
THIS I TOOK FOR A SIGN THAT HE HAD HIMSELF SOMETHING TO PRODUCE AND THAT WE SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO WAIT
IN THE FIRST WEEKS THE DAYS WERE LONG
WITH ME I MUST HAVE MADE A WONDERFUL FACE
I WAS BY THE STRANGEST OF CHANCES WONDERING HOW I SHOULD MEET HIM WHEN THE REVOLUTION UNMISTAKABLY OCCURRED
AS I PAUSED BENEATH THE HIGH EAST WINDOW AND LISTENED TO THE SOUNDS OF WORSHIP I WAS TAKEN WITH AN IMPULSE THAT MIGHT MASTER ME I FELT COMPLETELY SHOULD I GIVE IT THE LEAST ENCOURAGEMENT
DO YOU MEAN YOU'LL WRITE REMEMBERING SHE COULDN'T I CAUGHT MYSELF UP
OH SHE WAS GLAD I WAS THERE
I THREW MYSELF UPON HIM AND IN THE TENDERNESS OF MY PITY I EMBRACED HIM
I FORGET WHAT I WAS ON THE PRESENT OCCASION
PERFECTLY CAN I RECALL NOW THE PARTICULAR WAY STRENGTH CAME TO ME BEFORE WE SEPARATED FOR THE NIGHT
YOU'RE LIKE A TROOP OF CAVALRY HE BEAUTIFULLY LAUGHED
THIS CONVENIENCE I WAS TOLD HAD BEEN ORDERED AND I FOUND TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE JUNE AFTERNOON A COMMODIOUS FLY IN WAITING FOR ME
IF YOU SHOULD WISH STILL TO WAIT I WOULD ENGAGE SHE SHOULDN'T SEE ME NO NO
THEN WHAT AM I TO TELL HIM YOU NEEDN'T TELL HIM ANYTHING
HE CAN'T SEND YOU BACK OH I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK HE BROKE IN
THAT'S WHOM HE WAS LOOKING FOR BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW MY EXALTATION GREW
WHATEVER HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN FROM SCHOOL FOR IT WAS NOT FOR UGLY FEEDING
I HAD ONLY DONE SOMETHING MUCH WORSE--I HAD FORGOTTEN
I DARESAY
ONE OF THESE FOR A MOMENT TEMPTED ME WITH SUCH SINGULAR INTENSITY THAT TO WITHSTAND IT I MUST HAVE GRIPPED MY LITTLE GIRL WITH A SPASM THAT WONDERFULLY SHE SUBMITTED TO WITHOUT A CRY OR A SIGN OF FRIGHT
THEY KNOW THEY KNOW AND WHAT ON EARTH I FELT HER INCREDULITY AS SHE HELD ME
BUT WHAT HE FINALLY SAID WAS
THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN BY AN IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE I FOUND MYSELF CATCHING THEM UP AND PRESSING THEM TO MY HEART
I WAS QUEER COMPANY ENOUGH--QUITE AS QUEER AS THE COMPANY I RECEIVED
I'M AFRAID OF HIM MRS GROSE'S LARGE FACE SHOWED ME AT THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FARAWAY FAINT GLIMMER OF A CONSCIOUSNESS MORE ACUTE
SHE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE APPARITION WE HAD MET AT THE LAKE AND COULD NOW COMMUNICATE WITH IT AS SHE HAD NOT THEN BEEN ABLE TO DO
THERE ARE DIRECTIONS IN WHICH I MUST NOT FOR THE PRESENT LET MYSELF GO MEANWHILE I RETURNED TO HER FIRST EXAMPLE--THE ONE TO WHICH SHE HAD JUST PREVIOUSLY REFERRED--OF THE BOY'S HAPPY CAPACITY FOR AN OCCASIONAL SLIP
IF THEY HAD BEEN AT ALL VISIBLY BLIGHTED OR BATTERED SHE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE GROWN ON TRACING IT BACK HAGGARD ENOUGH TO MATCH THEM
I WAS THERE TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE LITTLE CREATURES IN THE WORLD THE MOST BEREAVED AND THE MOST LOVABLE THE APPEAL OF WHOSE HELPLESSNESS HAD SUDDENLY BECOME ONLY TOO EXPLICIT A DEEP CONSTANT ACHE OF ONE'S OWN COMMITTED HEART
I LIKED HER EXTREMELY AND AM GLAD TO THIS DAY TO THINK SHE LIKED ME TOO
THERE'S ONE THING OF COURSE I WENT ON
SHE EXPRESSED IN HER LITTLE WAY AN EXTRAORDINARY DETACHMENT FROM DISAGREEABLE DUTIES LOOKING TO ME HOWEVER WITH A GREAT CHILDISH LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO OFFER IT AS A MERE RESULT OF THE AFFECTION SHE HAD CONCEIVED FOR MY PERSON WHICH HAD RENDERED NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD FOLLOW ME
SHE SMILED AND SMILED AND WE MET
THAT NEEDN'T SURPRISE YOU MY VOICE TREMBLED SO THAT I FELT IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPRESS THE SHAKE
I WAS LIFTED ALOFT ON A GREAT WAVE OF INFATUATION AND PITY
LOOKING DOWN IT FROM THE TOP I ONCE RECOGNIZED THE PRESENCE OF A WOMAN SEATED ON ONE OF THE LOWER STEPS WITH HER BACK PRESENTED TO ME HER BODY HALF-BOWED AND HER HEAD IN AN ATTITUDE OF WOE IN HER HANDS
I FOUND IT A SPLENDID PORTENT
IT WOULD TAX HIS INVENTION CERTAINLY AND I FELT THIS TIME OVER HIS REAL EMBARRASSMENT A CURIOUS THRILL OF TRIUMPH
NO I LIKE IT WORSE BUT AFTER AN INSTANT I ADDED
THIS I RECOGNIZE IS FROM THE HEADMASTER AND THE HEADMASTER'S AN AWFUL BORE
NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING I ALMOST SHOUTED IN MY JOY
IT WILL TAKE US BUT TEN MINUTES BUT IT'S FAR ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE THE CHILD PREFER NOT TO WALK
AT THE HOUR I NOW SPEAK OF SHE HAD JOINED ME UNDER PRESSURE ON THE TERRACE WHERE WITH THE LAPSE OF THE SEASON THE AFTERNOON SUN WAS NOW AGREEABLE
ACHIEVING THIS TRANSIT I UNCOVERED THE GLASS WITHOUT A SOUND AND APPLYING MY FACE TO THE PANE WAS ABLE THE DARKNESS WITHOUT BEING MUCH LESS THAN WITHIN TO SEE THAT I COMMANDED THE RIGHT DIRECTION
WE HANDSHOOK AND CANDLESTUCK AS SOMEBODY SAID AND WENT TO BED
DON'T YOU REMEMBER HOW I TOLD YOU WHEN I CAME AND SAT ON YOUR BED THE NIGHT OF THE STORM THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOU YES YES HE ON HIS SIDE MORE AND MORE VISIBLY NERVOUS HAD A TONE TO MASTER
AS I HAD AMPLY SHOWN MOREOVER WHEN ON HIS JOINING ME IN THE SCHOOLROOM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT I HAD UTTERED ON THE SUBJECT OF THE INTERVAL JUST CONCLUDED NEITHER CHALLENGE NOR HINT
AND WHAT DID FLORA SAY MISS FLORA WAS TOO SWEET
THAN WHICH NOTHING I REFLECTED COULD BETTER HAVE EXPRESSED HIS FRANK VIEW OF THE ABRUPT TRANSFORMATION OF MY OFFICE
SHE'LL MAKE ME OUT TO HIM THE LOWEST CREATURE I WINCED AT THE FAIR SHOW OF THE SCENE IN MRS GROSE'S FACE
SUCH A WOUND AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED--AND AS ON THE FINAL EVIDENCE HAD BEEN--BY A FATAL SLIP IN THE DARK AND AFTER LEAVING THE PUBLIC HOUSE ON THE STEEPISH ICY SLOPE A WRONG PATH ALTOGETHER AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HE LAY
I BEGAN TO WATCH THEM IN A STIFLED SUSPENSE A DISGUISED EXCITEMENT THAT MIGHT WELL HAD IT CONTINUED TOO LONG HAVE TURNED TO SOMETHING LIKE MADNESS
AND IN THE SECOND BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ALSO WITHIN THE MINUTE SHE HAD IN HER PLAY TURNED HER BACK TO THE WATER
DON'T THEY DO ENOUGH I DEMANDED IN A LOWER TONE WHILE THE CHILDREN HAVING SMILED AND NODDED AND KISSED HANDS TO US RESUMED THEIR EXHIBITION
I HAD LEFT HER MEANWHILE IN LITTLE DOUBT OF MY SMALL HOPE OF REPRESENTING WITH SUCCESS EVEN TO HER ACTUAL SYMPATHY MY SENSE OF THE REAL SPLENDOR OF THE LITTLE INSPIRATION WITH WHICH AFTER I HAD GOT HIM INTO THE HOUSE THE BOY MET MY FINAL ARTICULATE CHALLENGE
STILL ALL THIS WHILE NOTHING MORE PASSED BETWEEN US SAVE THAT FLORA HAD LET HER FOOLISH FERN AGAIN DROP TO THE GROUND
BUT OUR YOUNG LADY NEVER CAME BACK AND AT THE VERY MOMENT I WAS EXPECTING HER I HEARD FROM THE MASTER THAT SHE WAS DEAD I TURNED THIS OVER
THERE WAS SOMEHOW LESS OF IT THAN I HAD EXPECTED
THEY'RE HERE THEY'RE HERE YOU LITTLE WRETCHES I WOULD HAVE CRIED AND YOU CAN'T DENY IT NOW THE LITTLE WRETCHES DENIED IT WITH ALL THE ADDED VOLUME OF THEIR SOCIABILITY AND THEIR TENDERNESS IN JUST THE CRYSTAL DEPTHS OF WHICH--LIKE THE FLASH OF A FISH IN A STREAM--THE MOCKERY OF THEIR ADVANTAGE PEEPED UP
AND SHE TOOK THE CHILDREN ALTOGETHER FOR THE INTERVAL
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GO ON AS YOU ARE IT STRUCK ME THAT AT THIS HE JUST FAINTLY COLORED
I DON'T ANTICIPATE EXCUSE ME--I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN HER SUCCESSOR'S PLACE I SUGGESTED I SHOULD HAVE WISHED TO LEARN IF THE OFFICE BROUGHT WITH IT NECESSARY DANGER TO LIFE DOUGLAS COMPLETED MY THOUGHT
A GENTLEMAN HE YOU KNOW HIM THEN SHE VISIBLY TRIED TO HOLD HERSELF
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME I PRESSED
X I REMAINED AWHILE AT THE TOP OF THE STAIR BUT WITH THE EFFECT PRESENTLY OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN MY VISITOR HAD GONE HE HAD GONE
AS SOON AS I APPEARED IN THE MOONLIGHT ON THE TERRACE HE HAD COME TO ME AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE
OH MISS MOST REMARKABLE
THE EFFECT OF WHICH ON MY NERVES WAS AN AGGRAVATION UNTIL I SAW THE NECESSITY OF MAKING IT A POSITIVE AID
SUCH THINGS NATURALLY LEFT ON THE SURFACE FOR THE TIME A CHILL WHICH WE VOCIFEROUSLY DENIED THAT WE FELT
IT WAS INDEED AS IF HE HAD FOUND EVEN NOW--AS HE HAD SO OFTEN FOUND AT LESSONS--STILL SOME OTHER DELICATE WAY TO EASE ME OFF
IS HE ILL-NATURED
I AGAIN SAW
SO FAR HAD DOUGLAS PRESENTED HIS PICTURE WHEN SOMEONE PUT A QUESTION
NOT A WORD--THAT'S THE HORROR
WE WERE TO KEEP OUR HEADS IF WE SHOULD KEEP NOTHING ELSE--DIFFICULT INDEED AS THAT MIGHT BE IN THE FACE OF WHAT IN OUR PRODIGIOUS EXPERIENCE WAS LEAST TO BE QUESTIONED
IT APPEARED THAT THE NARRATIVE HE HAD PROMISED TO READ US REALLY REQUIRED FOR A PROPER INTELLIGENCE A FEW WORDS OF PROLOGUE
NEITHER APPEAL NOR COMPLAIN NOR WRITE ABOUT ANYTHING
FOR IT WAS WONDROUS MATERIAL TO PLAY ON
HIS HAVING LIED AND BEEN IMPUDENT ARE I CONFESS LESS ENGAGING SPECIMENS THAN I HAD HOPED TO HAVE FROM YOU OF THE OUTBREAK IN HIM OF THE LITTLE NATURAL MAN
HAD IN PARTICULAR SENT THEM DOWN TO HIS OTHER HOUSE THE PROPER PLACE FOR THEM BEING OF COURSE THE COUNTRY AND KEPT THEM THERE FROM THE FIRST WITH THE BEST PEOPLE HE COULD FIND TO LOOK AFTER THEM PARTING EVEN WITH HIS OWN SERVANTS TO WAIT ON THEM AND GOING DOWN HIMSELF WHENEVER HE MIGHT TO SEE HOW THEY WERE DOING
WHAT SHE HAD SAID TO HIM SINCE I PRESSED WAS THAT SHE LIKED TO SEE YOUNG GENTLEMEN NOT FORGET THEIR STATION
THE MORE I'VE WATCHED AND WAITED THE MORE I'VE FELT THAT IF THERE WERE NOTHING ELSE TO MAKE IT SURE IT WOULD BE MADE SO BY THE SYSTEMATIC SILENCE OF EACH
I KNEW AT THIS HOUR I THINK AS WELL AS I KNEW LATER WHAT I WAS CAPABLE OF MEETING TO SHELTER MY PUPILS
I WAS GLAD ENOUGH I DIDN'T
THEN WITH ALL THE MARKS OF A DELIBERATION THAT MUST HAVE SEEMED MAGNIFICENT HAD THERE BEEN ANYONE TO ADMIRE IT I LAID DOWN MY BOOK ROSE TO MY FEET AND TAKING A CANDLE WENT STRAIGHT OUT OF THE ROOM AND FROM THE PASSAGE ON WHICH MY LIGHT MADE LITTLE IMPRESSION NOISELESSLY CLOSED AND LOCKED THE DOOR
BUT IF THE BOAT'S THERE WHERE ON EARTH'S SHE MY COLLEAGUE ANXIOUSLY ASKED
AND THEN THERE WAS CONSIDERATION--AND CONSIDERATION WAS SWEET
IT WAS FOR THE INSTANT CONFOUNDING AND BOTTOMLESS FOR IF HE WERE INNOCENT WHAT THEN ON EARTH WAS I
THE INSPIRATION--I CAN CALL IT BY NO OTHER NAME--WAS THAT I FELT HOW VOLUNTARILY HOW TRANSCENDENTLY I MIGHT
WHY HE'S SCARCE TEN YEARS OLD YES YES
I TOOK THAT HERE"--HE TAPPED HIS HEART
TO THOSE THEY LIKED HE ADDED
I FELT A SICK SWIM AT THE DROP OF MY VICTORY AND ALL THE RETURN OF MY BATTLE SO THAT THE WILDNESS OF MY VERITABLE LEAP ONLY SERVED AS A GREAT BETRAYAL
SO THAT YOU COULD SEE HE KNEW WHAT WAS BETWEEN THE TWO WRETCHES I DON'T KNOW--I DON'T KNOW THE POOR WOMAN GROANED
BUT I NOW FEEL THAT FOR WEEKS THE LESSONS MUST HAVE BEEN RATHER MY OWN
THERE WAS AN ALIEN OBJECT IN VIEW--A FIGURE WHOSE RIGHT OF PRESENCE I INSTANTLY PASSIONATELY QUESTIONED
SHE TOOK ME TO HER MOTHERLY BREAST AND MY LAMENTATION OVERFLOWED
I HOPE I WENT ON BRAVELY THAT YOU'VE BEEN ENJOYING YOURSELF OH YES I'VE BEEN EVER SO FAR
MASTER MILES DO YOU MEAN HE TOOK IT I GASPED
LESSONS IN THIS AGITATION CERTAINLY SUFFERED SOME DELAY
WHERE ALL THIS TIME WAS FLORA
DID I LOOK VERY QUEER THROUGH THIS WINDOW
I HAD HAD BROTHERS MYSELF AND IT WAS NO REVELATION TO ME THAT LITTLE GIRLS COULD BE SLAVISH IDOLATERS OF LITTLE BOYS
NO--I KNOW NOTHING
IS HE REALLY BAD THE TEARS WERE STILL IN HER EYES
WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOODNESS IS THE MATTER SHE WAS NOW FLUSHED AND OUT OF BREATH
UNLESS PERHAPS DEAR LITTLE FLORA YOU REALLY COMPARE ME TO A BABY GIRL THIS FOUND ME SINGULARLY WEAK
YET IT MADE HIM AVERT HIMSELF AGAIN AND THAT MOVEMENT MADE ME WITH A SINGLE BOUND AND AN IRREPRESSIBLE CRY SPRING STRAIGHT UPON HIM
MY SUPPORT IN THE PRESENCE OF DISASTER WOULD BE THE SAME AS IT HAD BEEN IN MY EARLY NEED OF CONFIDENCE AND IF MY FRIEND WOULD ANSWER FOR MY HONESTY I WOULD ANSWER FOR ALL THE REST
AND ON THIS WE SEPARATED
THE SHOCK I HAD SUFFERED MUST HAVE SHARPENED ALL MY SENSES
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER
HE HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE DEATH OF THEIR PARENTS IN INDIA GUARDIAN TO A SMALL NEPHEW AND A SMALL NIECE CHILDREN OF A YOUNGER A MILITARY BROTHER WHOM HE HAD LOST TWO YEARS BEFORE
WHAT IS HE LIKE I'VE BEEN DYING TO TELL YOU
BUT I WAS TO SEE IT WIND UP IN KEEN APPREHENSION
THEY WERE PRACTICALLY SIMULTANEOUS YET THEY HAD FLASHES OF SUCCESSION
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD SADLY
NOTHING AND TO THE BOY HIMSELF I WAS WONDERFUL
I WELCOMED THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT I WAS CHARGED WITH MUCH TO DO AND I CAUSED IT TO BE KNOWN AS WELL THAT LEFT THUS TO MYSELF I WAS QUITE REMARKABLY FIRM
I GOT HOLD OF THIS
DID BLY DISAGREE WITH HER SO TERRIBLY SUDDENLY NOT SO SUDDENLY AS YOU MIGHT THINK
YOU GO WITH NOTHING ON WHAT DO I CARE WHEN THE CHILD HAS NOTHING
I REPEATEDLY SAT UP TILL I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN
I APPRECIATE I SAID THE GREAT DECENCY OF YOUR NOT HAVING HITHERTO SPOKEN
AND I FOUND ABSOLUTELY A DEGREE OF HELP IN SEEING IT NOW SO STRAIGHT
HE HAD AT ANY RATE HIS FREEDOM NOW
I JUST MISSED ON THE STAIRCASE ON THE OTHER HAND A DIFFERENT ADVENTURE
YOU NAUGHTY
THERE WERE TIMES OF OUR BEING TOGETHER WHEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN READY TO SWEAR THAT LITERALLY IN MY PRESENCE BUT WITH MY DIRECT SENSE OF IT CLOSED THEY HAD VISITORS WHO WERE KNOWN AND WERE WELCOME
BUT SOMEONE THE CHILD HAS
I DON'T MEAN THAT THEY HAD THEIR TONGUES IN THEIR CHEEKS OR DID ANYTHING VULGAR FOR THAT WAS NOT ONE OF THEIR DANGERS
BY THE TIME I HAD GRASPED THE WHOLE OF WHICH I HAD ALSO EMBRACED FOR ABSENCE THE PRETEXT THAT I WAS ASHAMED TO OFFER MY PUPILS AND THE REST OF THE CONGREGATION SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF DELAY
I'VE DONE MY BEST BUT I'VE LOST YOU
PERHAPS EVEN IT WOULD BE NEARER THE TRUTH TO SAY THAT--WITHOUT A WORD--HE HIMSELF HAD CLEARED IT UP
MILES COULD VERY SIMPLY
AND NOW HER BROTHER HAS MANAGED IT FOR HER MRS GROSE STILL STOOD WHERE SHE HAD STOPPED
SO I SEE HER STILL SO I SEE HER BEST
THEN WHERE IS HE GONE I KNOW STILL LESS HAVE YOU SEEN HIM BEFORE YES--ONCE
SHE HAD CLEARLY BY THIS TIME AND VERY HONESTLY ADOPTED AN ATTITUDE
THE OLD TREES THE THICK SHRUBBERY MADE A GREAT AND PLEASANT SHADE BUT IT WAS ALL SUFFUSED WITH THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE HOT STILL HOUR
PRODUCED BY JUDITH BOSS THE TURN OF THE SCREW BY HENRY JAMES THE TEXT IS TAKE FROM THE FIRST AMERICAN APPEARANCE OF THIS BOOK THE TURN OF THE SCREW THE STORY HAD HELD US ROUND THE FIRE SUFFICIENTLY BREATHLESS BUT EXCEPT THE OBVIOUS REMARK THAT IT WAS GRUESOME AS ON CHRISTMAS EVE IN AN OLD HOUSE A STRANGE TALE SHOULD ESSENTIALLY BE I REMEMBER NO COMMENT UTTERED TILL SOMEBODY HAPPENED TO SAY THAT IT WAS THE ONLY CASE HE HAD MET IN WHICH SUCH A VISITATION HAD FALLEN ON A CHILD
OUR MEAL WAS OF THE BRIEFEST--MINE A VAIN PRETENSE AND I HAD THE THINGS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED
HE APPEARED TO WEIGH MY QUESTION BUT IN A MANNER QUITE DETACHED AND ALMOST HELPLESS
THERE WAS NO TRACE OF FLORA ON THAT NEARER SIDE OF THE BANK WHERE MY OBSERVATION OF HER HAD BEEN MOST STARTLING AND NONE ON THE OPPOSITE EDGE WHERE SAVE FOR A MARGIN OF SOME TWENTY YARDS A THICK COPSE CAME DOWN TO THE WATER
I COULDN'T ABJURE FOR MERELY WANTING TO BUT I COULD REPEAT TO MRS GROSE--AS I DID THERE OVER AND OVER IN THE SMALL HOURS--THAT WITH THEIR VOICES IN THE AIR THEIR PRESSURE ON ONE'S HEART AND THEIR FRAGRANT FACES AGAINST ONE'S CHEEK EVERYTHING FELL TO THE GROUND BUT THEIR INCAPACITY AND THEIR BEAUTY
YES SHE WAS IN LOVE
IT HAD BEEN AGREED BETWEEN US DOWNSTAIRS THAT AFTER THIS FIRST OCCASION I SHOULD HAVE HER AS A MATTER OF COURSE AT NIGHT HER SMALL WHITE BED BEING ALREADY ARRANGED TO THAT END IN MY ROOM
IT WAS PRECISELY IN SHORT BY JUST CLUTCHING THE HELM THAT I AVOIDED TOTAL WRECK
YOU DO KNOW YOU DEAR THING I REPLIED
AND I CAN'T THINK WHEREVER SHE MUST HAVE PICKED UP THE APPALLING LANGUAGE SHE APPLIED TO ME
THEY HAD A DELIGHTFUL ENDLESS APPETITE FOR PASSAGES IN MY OWN HISTORY TO WHICH I HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN TREATED THEM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ALL THE REST OH YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I COULD SAY NOTHING FOR A MINUTE THOUGH I FELT AS I HELD HIS HAND AND OUR EYES CONTINUED TO MEET THAT MY SILENCE HAD ALL THE AIR OF ADMITTING HIS CHARGE AND THAT NOTHING IN THE WHOLE WORLD OF REALITY WAS PERHAPS AT THAT MOMENT SO FABULOUS AS OUR ACTUAL RELATION
INTO THIS ATTITUDE MRS GROSE IMMEDIATELY AND VIOLENTLY ENTERED BREAKING EVEN WHILE THERE PIERCED THROUGH MY SENSE OF RUIN A PRODIGIOUS PRIVATE TRIUMPH INTO BREATHLESS REASSURANCE
THERE WAS A FIGURE IN THE GROUNDS--A FIGURE PROWLING FOR A SIGHT THE VISITOR WITH WHOM FLORA WAS ENGAGED
I WAITED AN INSTANT
EVERYBODY WILL STAY I WILL"--AND I WILL CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED
I WAS SURE AT ANY RATE SHE ADDED THAT HE DIDN'T
WHAT WAS THE LADY WHO WAS HERE BEFORE THE LAST GOVERNESS
I DID SO
AT ALL EVENTS I WANT TO TRY
I HAD SIMPLY IN OTHER WORDS PLUNGED AFRESH INTO FLORA'S SPECIAL SOCIETY AND THERE BECOME AWARE--IT WAS ALMOST A LUXURY!--THAT SHE COULD PUT HER LITTLE CONSCIOUS HAND STRAIGHT UPON THE SPOT THAT ACHED
HE HAS PROVIDED FOR HIMSELF AS WELL
I SAID NOTHING TILL SHE CAME QUITE NEAR
IN THIS POSITION SHE PRODUCED AN ALMOST FURIOUS WAIL
OH HANDSOME--VERY VERY I INSISTED
NO I TOOK THE GOOD CREATURE IN MY ARMS AND AFTER WE HAD EMBRACED LIKE SISTERS FELT STILL MORE FORTIFIED AND INDIGNANT
WELL I SAID IN MY TORMENT YOU MUST PUT IT TO ME AGAIN BUT I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO TELL YOU FOR SOME DAYS
THEN IT WAS THAT HAD I NOT BEEN DETERRED BY THE VERY CHANCE THAT SUCH AN INJURY MIGHT PROVE GREATER THAN THE INJURY TO BE AVERTED MY EXULTATION WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUT
IF HE LEFT HERE SUCH PEOPLE HE DIDN'T REALLY IN THE LEAST KNOW THEM
BUT AS MY LITTLE CONDUCTRESS WITH HER HAIR OF GOLD AND HER FROCK OF BLUE DANCED BEFORE ME ROUND CORNERS AND PATTERED DOWN PASSAGES I HAD THE VIEW OF A CASTLE OF ROMANCE INHABITED BY A ROSY SPRITE SUCH A PLACE AS WOULD SOMEHOW FOR DIVERSION OF THE YOUNG IDEA TAKE ALL COLOR OUT OF STORYBOOKS AND FAIRYTALES
THE IMPRESSION SHE GAVE ME THERE YESTERDAY WAS I ASSURE YOU THE VERY STRANGEST OF ALL
WE WENT DOWN TOGETHER AND AT THE BOTTOM I DETAINED HER HOLDING HER THERE WITH A HAND ON HER ARM
I HAD SAT DOWN WITH A PIECE OF WORK--FOR I WAS SOMETHING OR OTHER THAT COULD SIT--ON THE OLD STONE BENCH WHICH OVERLOOKED THE POND
SHE ASKS ME EVERY THREE MINUTES IF I THINK YOU'RE COMING IN I SEE--I SEE I TOO ON MY SIDE HAD SO MUCH MORE THAN WORKED IT OUT
I SEE WE HAD ARRIVED WITHIN SIGHT OF THE CHURCH AND OF VARIOUS PERSONS INCLUDING SEVERAL OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF BLY ON THEIR WAY TO IT AND CLUSTERED ABOUT THE DOOR TO SEE US GO IN
HE COULD DO WHAT HE LIKED WITH ALL HIS CLEVERNESS TO HELP HIM SO LONG AS I SHOULD CONTINUE TO DEFER TO THE OLD TRADITION OF THE CRIMINALITY OF THOSE CARETAKERS OF THE YOUNG WHO MINISTER TO SUPERSTITIONS AND FEARS
THIS INFERENCE GREW IN A FEW MINUTES TO SHARP INTENSITY AND SEEMED BOUND UP WITH THE DIRECT PERCEPTION THAT IT WAS POSITIVELY HE WHO WAS
DO YOU MEAN I ANXIOUSLY ASKED THAT THEY HAVE MET AT THIS SHE QUITE FLUSHED
I'LL PUT IT BEFORE HIM I WENT ON INEXORABLY THAT I CAN'T UNDERTAKE TO WORK THE QUESTION ON BEHALF OF A CHILD WHO HAS BEEN EXPELLED FOR WE'VE NEVER IN THE LEAST KNOWN WHAT MRS GROSE DECLARED
AND WHAT BECAME OF HIM SHE HUNG FIRE SO LONG THAT I WAS STILL MORE MYSTIFIED
HE WENT TOO SHE BROUGHT OUT AT LAST
FOR THERE AGAIN AGAINST THE GLASS AS IF TO BLIGHT HIS CONFESSION AND STAY HIS ANSWER WAS THE HIDEOUS AUTHOR OF OUR WOE--THE WHITE FACE OF DAMNATION
THE POSTBAG THAT EVENING--IT CAME LATE--CONTAINED A LETTER FOR ME WHICH HOWEVER IN THE HAND OF MY EMPLOYER I FOUND TO BE COMPOSED BUT OF A FEW WORDS ENCLOSING ANOTHER ADDRESSED TO HIMSELF WITH A SEAL STILL UNBROKEN
THOSE I LIKED THOSE HE LIKED
WHAT I HAD THEN HAD AN UGLY GLIMPSE OF WAS THAT MY EYES MIGHT BE SEALED JUST WHILE THEIRS WERE MOST OPENED
HE REPEATED YOUR WORDS TO QUINT NO NOT THAT
IT ONLY IN TRUTH LEFT MY FRIEND STILL MORE GRAVE
HIS FACE WAS CLOSE TO THE GLASS YET THE EFFECT OF THIS BETTER VIEW WAS STRANGELY ONLY TO SHOW ME HOW INTENSE THE FORMER HAD BEEN
I HAD NOT GONE TO BED
I'LL SAVE YOU WITHOUT HIM SHE CRIED AS SHE WENT
I FELT THAT I DOUBTLESS NEEDN'T PRESS TOO HARD IN SUCH COMPANY ON THE PLACE OF A SERVANT IN THE SCALE
IT'S A POLICY AND A FRAUD ON THE PART OF LITTLE DARLINGS AS YET MERE LOVELY BABIES
WELL MY EYES WERE SEALED IT APPEARED AT PRESENT--A CONSUMMATION FOR WHICH IT SEEMED BLASPHEMOUS NOT TO THANK GOD
THIS WAS SO SINGULARLY THE CASE THAT IT HAD PRESUMABLY MUCH TO DO WITH THE FACT AS TO WHICH AT THE PRESENT DAY I AM AT A LOSS FOR A DIFFERENT EXPLANATION
THERE IS A NAIVE SIDE I SUPPOSE IN ALL DIPLOMACY
BUT REALLY I WAS AFRAID AFRAID OF WHAT OF THINGS THAT MAN COULD DO
ADORABLE THEY MUST IN TRUTH HAVE BEEN I NOW REFLECT THAT I DIDN'T IN THESE DAYS HATE THEM
IT WAS PRECISELY THE FIRST NIGHT DURING THIS SERIES THAT WEARY WITH WATCHING I HAD FELT THAT I MIGHT AGAIN WITHOUT LAXITY LAY MYSELF DOWN AT MY OLD HOUR
IT LASTED WHILE I JUST BRIDLED A LITTLE WITH THE SENSE THAT MY OFFICE DEMANDED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO SUCH IGNORANCE AND NO SUCH PERSON
HOW HOW HOW
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO FREE HE HAD REALLY A MANNER OF HIS OWN AND I COULD ONLY TRY TO KEEP UP WITH HIM
THAT SHE NOW SAW--AS SHE HAD NOT I HAD SATISFIED MYSELF THE PREVIOUS TIME--WAS PROVED TO ME BY THE FACT THAT SHE WAS DISTURBED NEITHER BY MY REILLUMINATION NOR BY THE HASTE I MADE TO GET INTO SLIPPERS AND INTO A WRAP
GOODBYE
I DON'T SAVE OR SHIELD THEM
SAW THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY AWARE DO YOU MEAN AWARE OF HIM NO--OF HER I WAS CONSCIOUS AS I SPOKE THAT I LOOKED PRODIGIOUS THINGS FOR I GOT THE SLOW REFLECTION OF THEM IN MY COMPANION'S FACE
THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE--AND THERE IS SOMETHING MORE DIRE IN THIS I FEEL THAN IN ANYTHING I HAVE TO RELATE--I WAS DETERMINED BY A SENSE THAT WITHIN A MINUTE ALL SOUNDS FROM HER HAD PREVIOUSLY DROPPED
BUT IT'S NOT THE FIRST OCCURRENCE OF ITS CHARMING KIND THAT I KNOW TO HAVE INVOLVED A CHILD
I WAS AWARE AFRESH WITH HER AS WE WENT OF HOW LIKE HER BROTHER SHE CONTRIVED--IT WAS THE CHARMING THING IN BOTH CHILDREN--TO LET ME ALONE WITHOUT APPEARING TO DROP ME AND TO ACCOMPANY ME WITHOUT APPEARING TO SURROUND
IT WAS PARTLY AT SUCH JUNCTURES AS THESE AND PARTLY AT QUITE DIFFERENT ONES THAT WITH THE TURN MY MATTERS HAD NOW TAKEN MY PREDICAMENT AS I HAVE CALLED IT GREW MOST SENSIBLE
HE HAD GOT OUT OF ME THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING I WAS MUCH AFRAID OF AND THAT HE SHOULD PROBABLY BE ABLE TO MAKE USE OF MY FEAR TO GAIN FOR HIS OWN PURPOSE MORE FREEDOM
SO HE HAD EVERYTHING TO SAY
WHEN I'M BAD I AM BAD I SEE I SEE--IT'S CHARMING
IT WAS NOT SO MUCH YET THAT I WAS MORE NERVOUS THAN I COULD BEAR TO BE AS THAT I WAS REMARKABLY AFRAID OF BECOMING SO
OUT STRAIGHT OUT
I GAVE HER SOMETHING OF THE SHOCK THAT I HAD RECEIVED
A TALK
FLORA WAS SO MARKEDLY FEVERISH THAT AN ILLNESS WAS PERHAPS AT HAND
UNLESS OF COURSE WE CAN PREVENT STANDING THERE BEFORE ME WHILE I KEPT MY SEAT SHE VISIBLY TURNED THINGS OVER
SHE NEVER HEARD OR KNEW THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DEATH I THOUGHT WITH SOME INTENSITY
I FELT SURE AT THE END OF THREE DAYS AND AS THE RESULT OF MERE CLOSER ATTENTION THAT I HAD NOT BEEN PRACTICED UPON BY THE SERVANTS NOR MADE THE OBJECT OF ANY GAME OF WHATEVER IT WAS THAT I KNEW NOTHING WAS KNOWN AROUND ME
AND WHILE I HELD HIM TO MY BREAST WHERE I COULD FEEL IN THE SUDDEN FEVER OF HIS LITTLE BODY THE TREMENDOUS PULSE OF HIS LITTLE HEART I KEPT MY EYES ON THE THING AT THE WINDOW AND SAW IT MOVE AND SHIFT ITS POSTURE
I DIDN'T STEAL MY FACE MUST HAVE SHOWN HIM I BELIEVED HIM UTTERLY
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY ON THIS OCCASION A LIVING DETESTABLE DANGEROUS PRESENCE
TOOK THE UNOPENED MISSIVE AT LAST UP TO MY ROOM AND ONLY ATTACKED IT JUST BEFORE GOING TO BED
BUT I SHALL GET IT OUT OF YOU YET
EVERYTHING EVERYTHING
WELL DO YOU LIKE IT HE STOOD THERE SMILING
XXII YET IT WAS WHEN SHE HAD GOT OFF--AND I MISSED HER ON THE SPOT--THAT THE GREAT PINCH REALLY CAME
IT WAS A PITIFUL SURRENDER TO AGITATION BUT MY BEING AWARE OF THIS HAD SOMEHOW NO POWER TO RESTORE ME
AFTER RISING IN TOWN TO MEET HIS APPEAL I HAD AT ALL EVENTS A COUPLE OF VERY BAD DAYS--FOUND MYSELF DOUBTFUL AGAIN FELT INDEED SURE I HAD MADE A MISTAKE
HIDDEN PROTECTED ABSORBED SHE EVIDENTLY RESTED ON THE SILL--THE CASEMENT OPENED FORWARD--AND GAVE HERSELF UP
I NEVER HAVE
AND IT FINALLY GOT SO THE BETTER OF ME THAT I DETERMINED TO OPEN MYSELF AT LEAST TO MRS GROSE
OH YES THEY ASKED ME TO SAY NOTHING
AS SOON AS I COULD COMPASS A PRIVATE WORD WITH MRS GROSE I DECLARED TO HER THAT IT WAS GROTESQUE
WE WERE ALONE WITH THE QUIET DAY AND HIS LITTLE HEART DISPOSSESSED HAD STOPPED
I WAS READY TO KNOW THE VERY WORST THAT WAS TO BE KNOWN
IT WAS A BIG UGLY ANTIQUE BUT CONVENIENT HOUSE EMBODYING A FEW FEATURES OF A BUILDING STILL OLDER HALF-REPLACED AND HALF-UTILIZED IN WHICH I HAD THE FANCY OF OUR BEING ALMOST AS LOST AS A HANDFUL OF PASSENGERS IN A GREAT DRIFTING SHIP
I CAN THEN I BROKE IN WITH A LAUGH THAT WAS DOUBTLESS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH
THEN THERE SHE IS WE BOTH EXCLAIMED AT ONCE
SHE HAD TOLD ME BIT BY BIT UNDER PRESSURE A GREAT DEAL
WHY NOT BREAK OUT AT HER ON THE SPOT AND HAVE IT ALL OVER?--GIVE IT TO HER STRAIGHT IN HER LOVELY LITTLE LIGHTED FACE
IT WAS ONLY A QUESTION OF HURRYING AGAIN FOR A FEW PREPARATIONS TO THE HOUSE WHICH THE ATTENDANCE AT CHURCH OF SO MANY OF THE SERVANTS WOULD PRACTICALLY HAVE LEFT UNOCCUPIED
PERHAPS NOT
THERE WERE SHRUBBERIES AND BIG TREES BUT I REMEMBER THE CLEAR ASSURANCE I FELT THAT NONE OF THEM CONCEALED HIM
THE FRAMES AND SQUARES OF THE GREAT WINDOW WERE A KIND OF IMAGE FOR HIM OF A KIND OF FAILURE
I'VE SAID IT ALREADY--SHE WAS LITERALLY SHE WAS HIDEOUSLY HARD
YET IT DID REACH HIM
ALL THE SAME I CONTINUED I CAN'T IF HER UNCLE SEES HER CONSENT TO HIS SEEING HER BROTHER WITHOUT MY HAVING GIVEN THE BOY--AND MOST OF ALL BECAUSE THINGS HAVE GOT SO BAD--A LITTLE MORE TIME MY FRIEND APPEARED ON THIS GROUND MORE RELUCTANT THAN I COULD QUITE UNDERSTAND
IT WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT FOR A PERIOD OF SEVERAL MONTHS QUINT AND THE BOY HAD BEEN PERPETUALLY TOGETHER
WHAT UNDER MY ENDLESS OBSESSION I HAD BEEN IMPELLED TO LISTEN FOR WAS SOME BETRAYAL OF HIS NOT BEING AT REST AND I PRESENTLY CAUGHT ONE BUT NOT IN THE FORM I HAD EXPECTED
HE'S EXQUISITE--SO IT CAN BE ONLY THAT
I HAD ONLY AFTER JUST FALTERING AT THE FIRST CHILL GLOOM OF ITS DISUSE TO PASS ACROSS IT AND UNBOLT AS QUIETLY AS I COULD ONE OF THE SHUTTERS
HE STRUCK HER INEVITABLY AS GALLANT AND SPLENDID BUT WHAT TOOK HER MOST OF ALL AND GAVE HER THE COURAGE SHE AFTERWARD SHOWED WAS THAT HE PUT THE WHOLE THING TO HER AS A KIND OF FAVOR AN OBLIGATION HE SHOULD GRATEFULLY INCUR
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY A BAD NAME WITH A GREATER SWEETNESS OF INNOCENCE AND BY THE TIME I HAD GOT BACK TO BLY WITH HIM I REMAINED MERELY BEWILDERED--SO FAR THAT IS AS I WAS NOT OUTRAGED--BY THE SENSE OF THE HORRIBLE LETTER LOCKED UP IN MY ROOM IN A DRAWER
THEY OFTEN AT THEIR FINEST GAVE ME WHAT I USED TO CALL MY OWN HOUR THE HOUR WHEN FOR MY PUPILS TEATIME AND BEDTIME HAVING COME AND GONE I HAD BEFORE MY FINAL RETIREMENT A SMALL INTERVAL ALONE
HAD HAD HIS REASONS FOR A LONG SILENCE
SHE PULLED UP SHORT AS I HAD DONE
BUT IT PRODUCED IN HER AN ODD LAUGH
THEY WERE TOO BEAUTIFUL TO BE POSTED
AND TO PLY THEM WITH THAT EVIL STILL TO KEEP UP THE WORK OF DEMONS IS WHAT BRINGS THE OTHERS BACK LAWS SAID MY FRIEND UNDER HER BREATH
FOR THE WOMAN'S A HORROR OF HORRORS MRS GROSE AT THIS FIXED HER EYES A MINUTE ON THE GROUND
FLORA DOESN'T WANT ME TO KNOW IT'S ONLY THEN TO SPARE YOU NO NO--THERE ARE DEPTHS DEPTHS
SO I SHOWED THEM OFF AS I MIGHT
I DON'T KNOW HE ALMOST SMILED AT ME IN THE DESOLATION OF HIS SURRENDER WHICH WAS INDEED PRACTICALLY BY THIS TIME SO COMPLETE THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE LEFT IT THERE
THEY SAY THINGS THAT IF WE HEARD THEM WOULD SIMPLY APPALL US AND IF SHE IS THERE YES THEN MISS JESSEL IS BEYOND A DOUBT
I CALL IT RELIEF THOUGH IT WAS ONLY THE RELIEF THAT A SNAP BRINGS TO A STRAIN OR THE BURST OF A THUNDERSTORM TO A DAY OF SUFFOCATION
I HAD BETTER HAVE LET IT WAIT TILL MORNING FOR IT GAVE ME A SECOND SLEEPLESS NIGHT
AND THERE WERE FURTHER A COOK A HOUSEMAID A DAIRYWOMAN AN OLD PONY AN OLD GROOM AND AN OLD GARDENER ALL LIKEWISE THOROUGHLY RESPECTABLE
THAT WAS ALL I KNEW
THIS OPPORTUNITY CAME BEFORE TEA
STEADYING MYSELF WITH IT THERE AS I HAD REPEATEDLY DONE AT THOSE MOMENTS OF TORMENT THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED AS THE MOMENTS OF MY KNOWING THE CHILDREN TO BE GIVEN TO SOMETHING FROM WHICH I WAS BARRED I SUFFICIENTLY OBEYED MY HABIT OF BEING PREPARED FOR THE WORST
FOR A MINUTE THERE APART FROM OBSERVATION WE EXCHANGED MUTE ALARMS AND I COULD FEEL WITH WHAT HIGH INTEREST MY FRIEND RETURNED ME ALL THOSE I HAD FROM THE FIRST GIVEN HER
HE'S TALL ACTIVE ERECT I CONTINUED BUT NEVER--NO NEVER!--A GENTLEMAN MY COMPANION'S FACE HAD BLANCHED AS I WENT ON
THERE WAS A KIND OF SUPPORT IN THE SHY HEAVE OF HER SURPRISE
HAVEN'T I IT WASN'T FOR ME TO HELP HIM--IT WAS FOR THE THING I HAD MET
YOU MIGHT AS WELL BELIEVE IT OF THE LITTLE LADY
AND HE DROPPED INTO PEACEFUL SILENCE WHILE HE FELT HIS SITUATION
HAS SHE SAID TO YOU SINCE YESTERDAY--EXCEPT TO REPUDIATE HER FAMILIARITY WITH ANYTHING SO DREADFUL--A SINGLE OTHER WORD ABOUT MISS JESSEL NOT ONE MISS
BUT NEITHER OF US SPOKE OF IT
ONE STEP INTO THE ROOM HAD SUFFICED
IS HE INFIRM
THE LAST STORY HOWEVER INCOMPLETE AND LIKE THE MERE OPENING OF A SERIAL HAD BEEN TOLD
I HAVE SPOKEN OF THE SURRENDER TO THEIR EXTRAORDINARY CHILDISH GRACE AS A THING I COULD ACTIVELY CULTIVATE AND IT MAY BE IMAGINED IF I NEGLECTED NOW TO ADDRESS MYSELF TO THIS SOURCE FOR WHATEVER IT WOULD YIELD
FOR WICKEDNESS
WHEN I SAID TO MYSELF
SHE EXHALED A MOAN OF RELIEF AS WE AT LAST CAME IN SIGHT OF THE GREATER PART OF THE WATER WITHOUT A SIGHT OF THE CHILD
THERE WAS NOTHING IN HER FRESH FACE TO PASS ON TO OTHERS MY HORRIBLE CONFIDENCES
GO TO CHURCH
AND I WONDERED WHETHER IF INSTEAD OF BEING ABOVE I HAD BEEN BELOW I SHOULD HAVE HAD FOR GOING UP THE SAME NERVE I HAD LATELY SHOWN QUINT
FAR FROM THIS SHE PURSUED FAR FROM THEM SHE MAY BE DIFFERENT
THEN I JUDGED BEST SIMPLY TO HAND HER MY LETTER--WHICH HOWEVER HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING HER WITHOUT TAKING IT SIMPLY PUT HER HANDS BEHIND HER
CERTAINLY YOU SHALL GO BACK TO SCHOOL I SAID IF IT BE THAT THAT TROUBLES YOU
HE HAD NEVER FOR A SECOND SUFFERED
IT WAS A PITY THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO QUAVER OUT AGAIN THE REASONS FOR MY NOT HAVING IN MY DELUSION SO MUCH AS QUESTIONED THAT THE LITTLE GIRL SAW OUR VISITANT EVEN AS I ACTUALLY SAW MRS GROSE HERSELF AND THAT SHE WANTED BY JUST SO MUCH AS SHE DID THUS SEE TO MAKE ME SUPPOSE SHE DIDN'T AND AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT SHOWING ANYTHING ARRIVE AT A GUESS AS TO WHETHER I MYSELF DID
SO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH IT I'VE BURNED IT BURNED IT IT WAS NOW OR NEVER
FLIGHTS OF FANCY GAVE PLACE IN HER MIND TO A STEADY FIRESIDE GLOW AND I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO PERCEIVE HOW WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONVICTION THAT--AS TIME WENT ON WITHOUT A PUBLIC ACCIDENT--OUR YOUNG THINGS COULD AFTER ALL LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES SHE ADDRESSED HER GREATEST SOLICITUDE TO THE SAD CASE PRESENTED BY THEIR INSTRUCTRESS
IT WAS AS IF WHILE I TOOK IN--WHAT I DID TAKE IN--ALL THE REST OF THE SCENE HAD BEEN STRICKEN WITH DEATH
YOU'LL STAY ON WITH ME AND WE SHALL BOTH BE ALL RIGHT AND I WILL TELL YOU--I WILL
I SHALL HAVE TO SEND TO TOWN THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROAN AT THIS AND MUCH REPROACH
IT WAS THE VERY CONFIDENCE THAT I MIGHT NOW DEFY HIM AS WELL AS THE POSITIVE CERTITUDE BY THIS TIME OF THE CHILD'S UNCONSCIOUSNESS THAT MADE ME GO ON
MY SECOND WAS A VIOLENT PERCEPTION OF THE MISTAKE OF MY FIRST
WITHOUT A HAT I NATURALLY ALSO LOOKED VOLUMES
IT WAS A PITY THAT I NEEDED ONCE MORE TO DESCRIBE THE PORTENTOUS LITTLE ACTIVITY BY WHICH SHE SOUGHT TO DIVERT MY ATTENTION--THE PERCEPTIBLE INCREASE OF MOVEMENT THE GREATER INTENSITY OF PLAY THE SINGING THE GABBLING OF NONSENSE AND THE INVITATION TO ROMP
I HAD DROPPED WITH THE JOY OF HER REAPPEARANCE BACK INTO MY CHAIR--FEELING THEN AND THEN ONLY A LITTLE FAINT
MILES BEFORE HE SAT DOWN STOOD A MOMENT WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND LOOKED AT THE JOINT ON WHICH HE SEEMED ON THE POINT OF PASSING SOME HUMOROUS JUDGMENT
DOUBTLESS PERHAPS ALSO TO REFLECT THAT BY MY DISCRETION MY QUIET GOOD SENSE AND GENERAL HIGH PROPRIETY I WAS GIVING PLEASURE--IF HE EVER THOUGHT OF IT!--TO THE PERSON TO WHOSE PRESSURE I HAD RESPONDED
SHE HAD PICKED UP A SMALL FLAT PIECE OF WOOD WHICH HAPPENED TO HAVE IN IT A LITTLE HOLE THAT HAD EVIDENTLY SUGGESTED TO HER THE IDEA OF STICKING IN ANOTHER FRAGMENT THAT MIGHT FIGURE AS A MAST AND MAKE THE THING A BOAT
YET IT WAS ALL SO EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE TO MEET THAT AS THE PROSPECT GREW SHARP TO ME I AT LAST LET MYSELF GO
I WANTED TO GET THERE BEFORE THE QUESTION BETWEEN US OPENED UP MUCH FURTHER
SHE TURNED WHITE AND THIS MADE ME ASK MYSELF IF I HAD BLANCHED AS MUCH
I CAN SAY NOW NEITHER WHAT DETERMINED NOR WHAT GUIDED ME BUT I WENT STRAIGHT ALONG THE LOBBY HOLDING MY CANDLE HIGH TILL I CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF THE TALL WINDOW THAT PRESIDED OVER THE GREAT TURN OF THE STAIRCASE
I SAY MY DEAR IS SHE REALLY VERY AWFULLY ILL LITTLE FLORA
BUT THEY REMAINED UNACCOMPANIED AND EMPTY AND I CONTINUED UNMOLESTED
I AM UNABLE EVEN TO REMEMBER AT THIS DAY WHAT PROPOSAL I FRAMED FOR THE END OF HIS HOLIDAYS AND THE RESUMPTION OF HIS STUDIES
WELL HE DID HAVE IT
THE PLACE WITH ITS GRAY SKY AND WITHERED GARLANDS ITS BARED SPACES AND SCATTERED DEAD LEAVES WAS LIKE A THEATER AFTER THE PERFORMANCE--ALL STREWN WITH CRUMPLED PLAYBILLS
SO FOR THE BENEFIT OF WHOM IT MIGHT CONCERN I PARADED WITH A SICK HEART
HE WAS IN ONE OF THE ANGLES THE ONE AWAY FROM THE HOUSE VERY ERECT AS IT STRUCK ME AND WITH BOTH HANDS ON THE LEDGE
I FOUND MYSELF TO MEET MY FRIEND THE BETTER OFFERING IT ON THE SPOT SARCASTICALLY
BUT A SMALL SHIFTY SPOT ON THE WRONG SIDE OF IT ALL STILL SOMETIMES BRUSHED MY BROW LIKE THE WING OF A BAT
NOT A SOUND ON THE WAY HAD PASSED BETWEEN US AND I HAD WONDERED--OH HOW I HAD WONDERED!--IF HE WERE GROPING ABOUT IN HIS LITTLE MIND FOR SOMETHING PLAUSIBLE AND NOT TOO GROTESQUE
I CAUGHT HIM YES I HELD HIM--IT MAY BE IMAGINED WITH WHAT A PASSION
LAST EVENING IN THE FIRELIGHT AND THE SILENCE HE SAT WITH ME FOR TWO HOURS AS IF IT WERE JUST COMING MRS GROSE LOOKED HARD THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE GRAY GATHERING DAY
I DO REALLY DELIGHT IN YOUR SOCIETY AND I ONLY WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT I CONTENDED FOR A PRINCIPLE IT MAY BE IMAGINED WHETHER I RESISTED THIS APPEAL OR FAILED TO ACCOMPANY HIM AGAIN HAND IN HAND TO THE SCHOOLROOM
I WAS AT TRINITY AND I FOUND HER AT HOME ON MY COMING DOWN THE SECOND SUMMER
MISS JESSEL INDEED--SHE AH SHE'S RESPECTABLE THE CHIT
TURNED OUT FOR SUNDAY BY HIS UNCLE'S TAILOR WHO HAD HAD A FREE HAND AND A NOTION OF PRETTY WAISTCOATS AND OF HIS GRAND LITTLE AIR MILES'S WHOLE TITLE TO INDEPENDENCE THE RIGHTS OF HIS SEX AND SITUATION WERE SO STAMPED UPON HIM THAT IF HE HAD SUDDENLY STRUCK FOR FREEDOM I SHOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
HE NEVER SPOKE OF HIS SCHOOL NEVER MENTIONED A COMRADE OR A MASTER
THIS SECOND MORSEL AS I WATCHED HER SHE WAS VERY MARKEDLY AND INTENTLY ATTEMPTING TO TIGHTEN IN ITS PLACE
IT WAS THE DEAD SILENCE OF OUR LONG GAZE AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS THAT GAVE THE WHOLE HORROR HUGE AS IT WAS ITS ONLY NOTE OF THE UNNATURAL
I COULD FEEL IN HIM HOW HE ALREADY FROM MY AT FIRST FINDING NOTHING TO REPLY PERCEIVED THE ADVANTAGE HE HAD GAINED
SEE HIM MISS FIRST
AND I HELD THAT I CARRIED OUT THE SPIRIT OF THE PLEDGE GIVEN NOT TO APPEAL TO HIM WHEN I LET MY CHARGES UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR OWN LETTERS WERE BUT CHARMING LITERARY EXERCISES
IT TOOK LITTLE TIME TO SEE THAT I COULD SOUND WITHOUT FORMS OF INQUIRY AND WITHOUT EXCITING REMARK ANY DOMESTIC COMPLICATIONS
SHE HELD ME THERE A MOMENT THEN WHISKED UP HER APRON AGAIN WITH HER DETACHED HAND
BUT DID THE CHILDREN GIVE YOU A REASON FOR NOT ALLUDING TO YOUR LEAVING US
IF I DIDN'T HE REPEATED AS IF RETREATING FOR A JUMP YET LEAVING HIS THOUGHT SO UNFINISHED THAT AFTER WE HAD COME INTO THE GATE ANOTHER STOP WHICH HE IMPOSED ON ME BY THE PRESSURE OF HIS ARM HAD BECOME INEVITABLE
IX I WAITED AND WAITED AND THE DAYS AS THEY ELAPSED TOOK SOMETHING FROM MY CONSTERNATION
AFTER THESE SECRET SCENES I CHATTERED MORE THAN EVER GOING ON VOLUBLY ENOUGH TILL ONE OF OUR PRODIGIOUS PALPABLE HUSHES OCCURRED--I CAN CALL THEM NOTHING ELSE--THE STRANGE DIZZY LIFT OR SWIM I TRY FOR TERMS INTO A STILLNESS A PAUSE OF ALL LIFE THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MORE OR LESS NOISE THAT AT THE MOMENT WE MIGHT BE ENGAGED IN MAKING AND THAT I COULD HEAR THROUGH ANY DEEPENED EXHILARATION OR QUICKENED RECITATION OR LOUDER STRUM OF THE PIANO
I HAD LEFT A LIGHT BURNING BUT IT WAS NOW OUT AND I FELT AN INSTANT CERTAINTY THAT FLORA HAD EXTINGUISHED IT
THEY COULDN'T HAVE LASTED AS THEY ACTUALLY APPEARED TO ME TO LAST
HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE I TELL THE BAILIFF
MY UNCLE MUST COME DOWN AND YOU MUST COMPLETELY SETTLE THINGS IF WE DO I RETURNED WITH SOME SPIRIT YOU MAY BE SURE IT WILL BE TO TAKE YOU QUITE AWAY WELL DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M WORKING FOR
HE TURNED ROUND ONLY WHEN THE WAITER HAD LEFT US
I MEAN I CAN EXPRESS NO OTHERWISE THE SORT OF INTEREST MY COMPANIONS INSPIRED
FOR WHO WOULD EVER ABSOLVE ME WHO WOULD CONSENT THAT I SHOULD GO UNHUNG IF BY THE FAINTEST TREMOR OF AN OVERTURE I WERE THE FIRST TO INTRODUCE INTO OUR PERFECT INTERCOURSE AN ELEMENT SO DIRE
XV THE BUSINESS WAS PRACTICALLY SETTLED FROM THE MOMENT I NEVER FOLLOWED HIM
THERE ARE THINGS HE'LL ASK YOU HE TURNED IT OVER
SHE WOULD ALSO HAVE IN HOLIDAYS TO LOOK AFTER THE SMALL BOY WHO HAD BEEN FOR A TERM AT SCHOOL--YOUNG AS HE WAS TO BE SENT BUT WHAT ELSE COULD BE DONE?--AND WHO AS THE HOLIDAYS WERE ABOUT TO BEGIN WOULD BE BACK FROM ONE DAY TO THE OTHER
SHE WAS IN LOVE HE LAUGHED FOR THE FIRST TIME
I EXPLAINED IT
ALL THE SAME I PRESSED MY INTERLOCUTRESS
THIS SITUATION CONTINUED A MONTH AND WITH NEW AGGRAVATIONS AND PARTICULAR NOTES THE NOTE ABOVE ALL SHARPER AND SHARPER OF THE SMALL IRONIC CONSCIOUSNESS ON THE PART OF MY PUPILS
THEREFORE WHY NOT FRANKLY CONFESS IT TO ME SO THAT WE MAY AT LEAST LIVE WITH IT TOGETHER AND LEARN PERHAPS IN THE STRANGENESS OF OUR FATE WHERE WE ARE AND WHAT IT MEANS THIS SOLICITATION DROPPED ALAS AS IT CAME
THE MORE I SAW THE LESS THEY WOULD
HE HAD GIVEN EXACTLY THE ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF THAT PERMITTED LEAST OF MY GOING BEHIND IT AND IT WAS ONLY WITH THE EFFECT OF CONFIRMING MY ACCEPTANCE OF IT THAT AS I PRESENTLY GLANCED ABOUT THE ROOM I COULD SAY THEN YOU DIDN'T UNDRESS AT ALL HE FAIRLY GLITTERED IN THE GLOOM
TO WHATEVER IN ME WAS MOST EXCITABLE
THE MORE THAT MY FRIEND HAD DISCERNIBLY NOW GIRDED HER LOINS TO MEET ME ONCE MORE
THAT WAS WHAT REALLY OVERCAME ME WHAT PREVENTED MY GOING IN
WASN'T HE LOOKING THROUGH THE HAUNTED PANE FOR SOMETHING HE COULDN'T SEE?--AND WASN'T IT THE FIRST TIME IN THE WHOLE BUSINESS THAT HE HAD KNOWN SUCH A LAPSE
NO SHE GAZED IN DEEPER WONDER
WHAT DID YOU GO OUT FOR
IF I HAD COUNTED ON WHAT IT WOULD GIVE ME TO FIND MYSELF ALONE WITH MILES I SPEEDILY PERCEIVED AT LEAST THAT IT WOULD GIVE ME A MEASURE
THAT'S--WELL GETTING ON I LINGERED THERE WITH HIM AN INSTANT EVER SO KINDLY
SHE BROUGHT ME FOR THE INSTANT ALMOST ROUND
BUT WHAT I JUDGE MOST LIKELY IS THAT SHE'S ON THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE OTHER DAY WE SAW TOGETHER WHAT I TOLD YOU WHEN SHE PRETENDED NOT TO SEE WITH THAT ASTOUNDING SELF-POSSESSION
THERE WAS ONE DIRECTION ASSUREDLY IN WHICH THESE DISCOVERIES STOPPED
YOU'VE NEVER MENTIONED TO ME ONE OF YOUR MASTERS ONE OF YOUR COMRADES NOR THE LEAST LITTLE THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU AT SCHOOL
HERE FOR MANY DAYS AFTER IT WAS A QUEER AFFAIR ENOUGH
AND I FOR MY PART WAS QUITE TOO MUCH DISGUSTED TO ALLUDE TO THEM
THERE ARE NOT MANY OF YOUR OWN SORT MILES I LAUGHED
THEY WERE IN POSSESSION OF EVERYTHING THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO ME HAD HAD WITH EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THE STORY OF MY SMALLEST ADVENTURES AND OF THOSE OF MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND OF THE CAT AND THE DOG AT HOME AS WELL AS MANY PARTICULARS OF THE ECCENTRIC NATURE OF MY FATHER OF THE FURNITURE AND ARRANGEMENT OF OUR HOUSE AND OF THE CONVERSATION OF THE OLD WOMEN OF OUR VILLAGE
IT'S IN A LOCKED DRAWER--IT HAS NOT BEEN OUT FOR YEARS
THERE WERE NATURALLY THINGS THAT IN FLORA'S PRESENCE COULD PASS BETWEEN US ONLY AS PRODIGIOUS AND GRATIFIED LOOKS OBSCURE AND ROUNDABOUT ALLUSIONS
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE I TAKE SPACE TO MENTION
SHE HAD PASSED A NIGHT OF EXTREME UNREST A NIGHT AGITATED ABOVE ALL BY FEARS THAT HAD FOR THEIR SUBJECT NOT IN THE LEAST HER FORMER BUT WHOLLY HER PRESENT GOVERNESS
THE MORE I GO OVER IT THE MORE I SEE IN IT AND THE MORE I SEE IN IT THE MORE I FEAR
I JUMPED TO MY FEET AGAIN AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF DARKNESS
I WAS A LITTLE LATE ON THE SCENE AND I FELT AS HE STOOD WISTFULLY LOOKING OUT FOR ME BEFORE THE DOOR OF THE INN AT WHICH THE COACH HAD PUT HIM DOWN THAT I HAD SEEN HIM ON THE INSTANT WITHOUT AND WITHIN IN THE GREAT GLOW OF FRESHNESS THE SAME POSITIVE FRAGRANCE OF PURITY IN WHICH I HAD FROM THE FIRST MOMENT SEEN HIS LITTLE SISTER
BUT IF HE ISN'T A GENTLEMAN WHAT IS HE
AND WE SAT THERE TOGETHER WHILE BEFORE US AT A DISTANCE BUT WITHIN CALL IF WE WISHED THE CHILDREN STROLLED TO AND FRO IN ONE OF THEIR MOST MANAGEABLE MOODS
WHAT HAD HAPPENED NATURALLY CAUSED THEM ALL TO STARE
I I REMEMBER THE WHOLE BEGINNING AS A SUCCESSION OF FLIGHTS AND DROPS A LITTLE SEESAW OF THE RIGHT THROBS AND THE WRONG
SHE'S AN OLD OLD WOMAN I SCANNED ALL THE VISIBLE SHORE WHILE MRS GROSE TOOK AGAIN INTO THE QUEER ELEMENT I OFFERED HER ONE OF HER PLUNGES OF SUBMISSION
I MEAN THAT I SAW YESTERDAY WHEN I CAME BACK WITH MISS FLORA THAT IT WASN'T WHERE YOU HAD PUT IT
NO HOUR OF MY STAY IN FACT WAS SO ASSAILED WITH APPREHENSIONS AS THAT OF MY COMING DOWN TO LEARN THAT THE CARRIAGE CONTAINING MRS GROSE AND MY YOUNGER PUPIL HAD ALREADY ROLLED OUT OF THE GATES
AND I WAS NOT EVEN SURE THAT IN SPITE OF HER EXEMPTION IT WAS SHE WHO HAD THE BEST OF THE BURDEN
YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE HE REPEATED
THANK GOD IT SO JUSTIFIES ME IT DOES THAT MISS I COULDN'T HAVE DESIRED MORE EMPHASIS BUT I JUST HESITATED
WHILE THESE INSTANTS LASTED INDEED I HAD THE EXTRAORDINARY CHILL OF FEELING THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS THE INTRUDER
SHE LOOKED AT ME AS IF SHE HEARD ME BUT I HAD RECOVERED MYSELF AND CLEARED THE AIR
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE GIVEN LESS ENCOURAGEMENT THAN HE HAD DONE TO SUCH A DOCTRINE BUT IF WE HAD NOT HAD THE DOCTRINE TO FALL BACK UPON WE SHOULD HAVE DEPRIVED EACH OTHER OF SOME OF OUR FINEST EXHIBITIONS
DON'T YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO WRITE?"--THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT INQUIRY WE FOUND BY EXPERIENCE FOR CARRYING OFF AN AWKWARDNESS
MASTER MILES
SHE PERSISTS IN DENYING TO YOU THAT SHE SAW OR HAS EVER SEEN ANYTHING MY VISITOR'S TROUBLE TRULY WAS GREAT
THAT IS SHE HAD BEEN
AND I HELD MY BREATH WHILE I WAITED FOR WHAT A CRY FROM HER WHAT SOME SUDDEN INNOCENT SIGN EITHER OF INTEREST OR OF ALARM WOULD TELL ME
THEN BEFORE GOING DOWNSTAIRS I LOOKED INTO SEVERAL OTHERS
TO SHARE THEM SHE WANTS FLORA MRS GROSE MIGHT AS I GAVE IT TO HER FAIRLY HAVE FALLEN AWAY FROM ME HAD I NOT BEEN PREPARED
NO LET US PUT IT DEFINITELY MY DEAR THAT I DON'T
IT WAS AS IF HE WERE SUDDENLY AFRAID OF ME--WHICH STRUCK ME INDEED AS PERHAPS THE BEST THING TO MAKE HIM
WHAT WAS IT YOU HAD IN MIND WHEN IN OUR DISTRESS BEFORE MILES CAME BACK OVER THE LETTER FROM HIS SCHOOL YOU SAID UNDER MY INSISTENCE THAT YOU DIDN'T PRETEND FOR HIM THAT HE HAD NOT LITERALLY EVER BEEN BAD
BUT THE TIME HAS CERTAINLY COME TO GIVE ME THE WHOLE THING SHE APPEARED TO ASSENT TO THIS BUT STILL ONLY IN SILENCE
I COULD SEE
THEN YOU WEREN'T ASLEEP NOT MUCH
ONE COULD EASILY FIX HIS TYPE
ALSO THAT WE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THEM I CAN SEE DOUGLAS THERE BEFORE THE FIRE TO WHICH HE HAD GOT UP TO PRESENT HIS BACK LOOKING DOWN AT HIS INTERLOCUTOR WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NO SUCH JUSTIFICATION FOR ME AS THE PLAIN ASSENT OF HER EXPERIENCE TO WHATEVER DEPTH OF DEPRAVITY I FOUND CREDIBLE IN OUR BRACE OF SCOUNDRELS
A FRIEND--YOU OH YES I HAVE A COUPLE I LAUGHED
SHE RESENTS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE SOME HIGH LITTLE PERSONAGE THE IMPUTATION ON HER TRUTHFULNESS AND AS IT WERE HER RESPECTABILITY
WHY DID THEY NEVER RESENT MY INEXORABLE MY PERPETUAL SOCIETY
HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS THERE WHY OF COURSE I HEARD YOU
DID THEY SAY WHY I SHOULD LIKE IT BETTER NO
WAS THERE A SECRET AT BLY--A MYSTERY OF UDOLPHO OR AN INSANE AN UNMENTIONABLE RELATIVE KEPT IN UNSUSPECTED CONFINEMENT
YOU DON'T SEE HER EXACTLY AS WE SEE?--YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU DON'T NOW--NOW
I CAME TO MEET HIM MRS GROSE AT LAST TURNED ROUND AND THERE WAS STILL MORE IN HER FACE
IT MADE HIM ANXIOUS THOUGH HE WATCHED HIMSELF
I DARESAY I WAS WRONG
SHE DIDN'T MOVE
PUTTING THINGS AT THE WORST AT ALL EVENTS AS IN MEDITATION I SO OFTEN DID ANY CLOUDING OF THEIR INNOCENCE COULD ONLY BE--BLAMELESS AND FOREDOOMED AS THEY WERE--A REASON THE MORE FOR TAKING RISKS
SO HOW COULD WORK NOT BE CHARMING THAT PRESENTED ITSELF AS DAILY BEAUTY
THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I MIGHT DO HE THREW THAT OFF TO SHOW ME HOW GOOD HE IS
LEARNED TO BE AMUSED AND EVEN AMUSING AND NOT TO THINK FOR THE MORROW
WHICH MOREOVER AS WE LINGERED THERE WAS WHAT I SUCCEEDED IN PRACTICALLY PROVING
XIV WALKING TO CHURCH A CERTAIN SUNDAY MORNING I HAD LITTLE MILES AT MY SIDE AND HIS SISTER IN ADVANCE OF US AND AT MRS GROSE'S WELL IN SIGHT
I REFLECTED THAT I HAD ALREADY WITH HIM HURT MYSELF BEYOND REPAIR
THERE WERE DAYS WHEN I COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE OF THEM HAD WITH A SMALL INVISIBLE NUDGE SAID TO THE OTHER
THEN I AGAIN SHIFTED MY EYES--I FACED WHAT I HAD TO FACE
WE LOOKED AT THE EMPTY EXPANSE AND THEN I FELT THE SUGGESTION OF MY FRIEND'S EYES
SHE WAS THERE AND I WAS JUSTIFIED
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A CURIOSITY THAT FOR ALL THE NEXT HOURS WAS TO DEEPEN ALMOST TO PAIN
GOD KNOWS WHERE
THE CHAIN OF MY LOGIC WAS EVER TOO MUCH FOR HER
STUFF AND NONSENSE BUT THE NEXT AFTER THAT I MUST HAVE SOUNDED STERN ENOUGH
IT WAS LIKE FIGHTING WITH A DEMON FOR A HUMAN SOUL AND WHEN I HAD FAIRLY SO APPRAISED IT I SAW HOW THE HUMAN SOUL--HELD OUT IN THE TREMOR OF MY HANDS AT ARM'S LENGTH--HAD A PERFECT DEW OF SWEAT ON A LOVELY CHILDISH FOREHEAD
MY PERAMBULATIONS HAD GIVEN ME MEANWHILE NO GLIMPSE OF HIM BUT THEY HAD TENDED TO MAKE MORE PUBLIC THE CHANGE TAKING PLACE IN OUR RELATION AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS HAVING AT THE PIANO THE DAY BEFORE KEPT ME IN FLORA'S INTEREST SO BEGUILED AND BEFOOLED
IT'S OF NOT SEEING HER BUT MY COMPANION ONLY LOOKED WAN
IT WAS IN SHORT A MAGNIFICENT CHANCE
WELL YOU SHAN'T SUFFER I ANSWERED
IT WAS ALL THE ROMANCE OF THE NURSERY AND THE POETRY OF THE SCHOOLROOM
WE KNOW DON'T WE LOVE?"--AND SHE APPEALED BLUNDERING IN TO THE CHILD
IT WAS HIS BRIGHTNESS INDEED THAT GAVE ME A RESPITE
THAT WOULD BE IN A COUPLE OF HOURS AT THE END OF WHICH--I HAD THE ACUTE PREVISION--MY LITTLE PUPILS WOULD PLAY AT INNOCENT WONDER ABOUT MY NONAPPEARANCE IN THEIR TRAIN
I'LL BE HANGED IT SAID IF I_'LL SPEAK IT WAS FLORA WHO GAZING ALL OVER ME IN CANDID WONDER WAS THE FIRST
THEY HAD THE BLOOM OF HEALTH AND HAPPINESS
THEY HAD AS IT WERE AN EXTENT AND MASS FOR WHICH I HAD NOT BEEN PREPARED AND IN THE PRESENCE OF WHICH I FOUND MYSELF FRESHLY A LITTLE SCARED AS WELL AS A LITTLE PROUD
I SUPPOSE I NOW READ INTO OUR SITUATION A CLEARNESS IT COULDN'T HAVE HAD AT THE TIME FOR I SEEM TO SEE OUR POOR EYES ALREADY LIGHTED WITH SOME SPARK OF A PREVISION OF THE ANGUISH THAT WAS TO COME
THE WAY THIS KNOWLEDGE GATHERED IN ME WAS THE STRANGEST THING IN THE WORLD--THE STRANGEST THAT IS EXCEPT THE VERY MUCH STRANGER IN WHICH IT QUICKLY MERGED ITSELF
SHE'S AS BIG AS A BLAZING FIRE
WERE YOU VERY HAPPY AT SCHOOL HE JUST CONSIDERED
THEN SHE ADDED
THAT WILL COME OUT
HE'LL THEN BE ON MY SIDE--OF WHICH YOU SEE THE IMPORTANCE
THIS WAS A SUGGESTION THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER
DEAR LITTLE MILES DEAR LITTLE MILES IF YOU KNEW HOW I WANT TO HELP YOU
SHE SUCCUMBED TO IT HE GOT UP AND AS HE HAD DONE THE NIGHT BEFORE WENT TO THE FIRE GAVE A STIR TO A LOG WITH HIS FOOT THEN STOOD A MOMENT WITH HIS BACK TO US
WHICH AFTER ALL I COULD REFLECT WAS NO MORE THAN A GRACEFUL RESPONSE IN CHILDREN PERPETUALLY BOWED OVER AND HUGGED
BUT I WAS INFATUATED--I WAS BLIND WITH VICTORY THOUGH EVEN THEN THE VERY EFFECT THAT WAS TO HAVE BROUGHT HIM SO MUCH NEARER WAS ALREADY THAT OF ADDED SEPARATION
HE'S A HORROR A HORROR HE'S--GOD HELP ME IF I KNOW WHAT HE IS MRS GROSE LOOKED ROUND ONCE MORE
YET HE WANTED I FELT TO BE WITH ME
I QUAILED EVEN THOUGH MY CERTITUDE THAT SHE THOROUGHLY SAW WAS NEVER GREATER THAN AT THAT INSTANT AND IN THE IMMEDIATE NEED TO DEFEND MYSELF I CALLED IT PASSIONATELY TO WITNESS
I THINK HE WANTS TO GIVE ME AN OPENING
SHE LEFT IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR TO GO HOME AS SHE SAID FOR A SHORT HOLIDAY TO WHICH THE TIME SHE HAD PUT IN HAD CERTAINLY GIVEN HER A RIGHT
NEVER MENTIONED IT IN ANY WAY HE SEEMED TO WONDER
YES IT WAS TOO BAD TOO BAD WHAT I SUPPOSE I SOMETIMES SAID
OF COURSE NOW INDEED SHE MIGHT BE WITH THE MAIDS SO THAT THE IMMEDIATE THING WAS TO LOOK FOR HER WITHOUT AN AIR OF ALARM
WELL I WAS STRANGELY AT THE HELM
AT THIS I WAS ABLE TO STRAIGHTEN MYSELF
TO ME AT LEAST MAKING MY STATEMENT HERE WITH A DELIBERATION WITH WHICH I HAVE NEVER MADE IT THE WHOLE FEELING OF THE MOMENT RETURNS
I HAD NOT SEEN IT IN HARLEY STREET--I HAD NOT SEEN IT ANYWHERE
I MUST WATCH SLOWLY SHE FACED ME AGAIN
IT PRODUCED IN ME THIS FIGURE IN THE CLEAR TWILIGHT I REMEMBER TWO DISTINCT GASPS OF EMOTION WHICH WERE SHARPLY THE SHOCK OF MY FIRST AND THAT OF MY SECOND SURPRISE
BUT I HOPE HE THREW IN YOU DON'T PARTICULARLY MIND HAVING TO DO WITH YOU I ASKED
AND WHAT I IMAGINE IS DREADFUL NOT SO DREADFUL AS WHAT I DO I REPLIED
WITH THIS OUTBREAK AT LAST THE OUTBREAK I RETURNED WILL MAKE A TREMENDOUS OCCASION OF THURSDAY NIGHT AND EVERYONE SO AGREED WITH ME THAT IN THE LIGHT OF IT WE LOST ALL ATTENTION FOR EVERYTHING ELSE
THERE WERE THINGS ENOUGH TAKING ONE WITH ANOTHER TO CHATTER ABOUT IF ONE WENT VERY FAST AND KNEW BY INSTINCT WHEN TO GO ROUND
IN SPITE OF WHICH--AND IN SPITE ALSO OF THE DEEPER DEPTHS OF CONSTERNATION THAT HAD OPENED BENEATH MY FEET--THERE WAS LITERALLY IN THE EBBING ACTUAL AN EXTRAORDINARILY SWEET SADNESS
BUT IT'S RATHER NICE HIS LONG RETICENCE FORTY YEARS GRIFFIN PUT IN
HE GAVE THE MOST MOURNFUL THOUGHTFUL LITTLE HEADSHAKE
HERE WAS MY CHANCE
I REMEMBER FEELING WITH MILES IN ESPECIAL AS IF HE HAD HAD AS IT WERE NO HISTORY
THEY HAD NOTHING BUT ME AND I--WELL I HAD THEM
BUT IT'S AT THE WINDOW--STRAIGHT BEFORE US
BUT IT WAS NOT THE VISITOR MOST CONCERNED WITH MY BOY
I RETURNED HER THE LOOK SHE HAD GIVEN ME
IT'S THE PLACE ITSELF
I CAME DOWN TO THE DRIVE WHILE SHE STOOD IN THE DOORWAY
HOW CAN I DESCRIBE THAT EXCEPT BY SAYING THAT INSTEAD OF GROWING USED TO THEM--AND IT'S A MARVEL FOR A GOVERNESS
YET IN THE VERY PANG OF THE EFFORT I FELT IT VAIN TO TRY STERNNESS AND I HEARD MYSELF THE NEXT INSTANT SO GENTLE AS TO BE ALMOST GROTESQUE
CHOOSING THEN AT THE WINDOW WITH A CONCENTRATED NEED OF NOT ALARMING THE HOUSE RATHER THAT METHOD THAN A SIGNAL MORE RESONANT
SHE PROMPTLY UNDERSTOOD ME
THE USUAL PLACE OF EMBARKATION WAS HALF A MILE FROM THE HOUSE BUT I HAD AN INTIMATE CONVICTION THAT WHEREVER FLORA MIGHT BE SHE WAS NOT NEAR HOME
IF IT ISN'T A PROOF OF WHAT YOU SAY IT'S A PROOF OF--GOD KNOWS WHAT
I LIE AWAKE AND THINK I HAD PUT MY CANDLE DESIGNEDLY A SHORT WAY OFF AND THEN AS HE HELD OUT HIS FRIENDLY OLD HAND TO ME HAD SAT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED
THE PERSON IT APPEARED LEAST TO CONCERN PROVED TO BE TILL DINNER LITTLE MILES HIMSELF
BUT AFTER ALL I'M A FELLOW DON'T YOU SEE
MY DEAR I DON'T WANT TO GET OFF YOU CAN'T EVEN IF YOU DO
OH WE MUST CLUTCH AT THAT--WE MUST CLING TO IT
IS THAT WHAT YOU DID AT SCHOOL OH WHAT THIS BROUGHT UP
I USED TO WONDER HOW MY LITTLE CHARGES COULD HELP GUESSING THAT I THOUGHT STRANGE THINGS ABOUT THEM
THE ICY SLOPE THE TURN MISTAKEN AT NIGHT AND IN LIQUOR ACCOUNTED FOR MUCH--PRACTICALLY IN THE END AND AFTER THE INQUEST AND BOUNDLESS CHATTER FOR EVERYTHING
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE PURPOSE TODAY OF THE DURATION OF THESE THINGS
WHAT IS YOUR TITLE I HAVEN'T ONE OH I HAVE I SAID
WITHOUT IT THE NEXT INSTANT I SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE ON THE STAIR
AH HOW CAN YOU BECAUSE I'M CLEAR
THAT'S CHARMING NEWS TO BE SENT HIM BY A GOVERNESS WHOSE PRIME UNDERTAKING WAS TO GIVE HIM NO WORRY MRS GROSE CONSIDERED FOLLOWING THE CHILDREN AGAIN
HIS HAVING BEEN HERE AND THE TIME THEY WERE WITH HIM THE TIME THEY WERE WITH HIM AND HIS NAME HIS PRESENCE HIS HISTORY IN ANY WAY OH THE LITTLE LADY DOESN'T REMEMBER
SOMEONE YOU HAVE THEN TO SHOW HOW I HAD THOUGHT IT ALL OUT
THOUGH I'VE RENOUNCED ALL CLAIM TO YOUR COMPANY--YOU'RE SO BEYOND ME--I AT LEAST GREATLY ENJOY IT
I ACHIEVED THOUGHTFULLY A FEW LOOPS OF MY KNITTING
I QUICKLY BY WAY OF ANSWER FELT FOR MY LETTER DREW IT FORTH HELD IT UP AND THEN FREEING MYSELF WENT AND LAID IT ON THE GREAT HALL TABLE
SHE'S THERE YOU LITTLE UNHAPPY THING--THERE THERE THERE AND YOU SEE HER AS WELL AS YOU SEE ME I HAD SAID SHORTLY BEFORE TO MRS GROSE THAT SHE WAS NOT AT THESE TIMES A CHILD BUT AN OLD OLD WOMAN AND THAT DESCRIPTION OF HER COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE STRIKINGLY CONFIRMED THAN IN THE WAY IN WHICH FOR ALL ANSWER TO THIS SHE SIMPLY SHOWED ME WITHOUT A CONCESSION AN ADMISSION OF HER EYES A COUNTENANCE OF DEEPER AND DEEPER OF INDEED SUDDENLY QUITE FIXED REPROBATION
AND DOUBTLESS IT WAS THAT VERY NOTE THAT MOST EVOKED FOR ME THE POIGNANCY THE UNNATURAL CHILDISH TRAGEDY OF HIS PROBABLE REAPPEARANCE AT THE END OF THREE MONTHS WITH ALL THIS BRAVADO AND STILL MORE DISHONOR
DEEP OBSCURITY CONTINUED TO COVER THE REGION OF THE BOY'S CONDUCT AT SCHOOL
I GOT OUT OF IT CLOSED IT AND LISTENED FROM THE OTHER SIDE FOR SOME SOUND FROM HER
YOU SEE YOU SEE YOU KNOW THAT YOU DO AND THAT YOU ALREADY QUITE SUSPECT I BELIEVE IT
I DIDN'T ASK MORE THAN THAT--I ONLY ASKED THAT HE SHOULD KNOW
LET ME ADD THAT IN THEIR COMPANY NOW--AND I WAS CAREFUL ALMOST NEVER TO BE OUT OF IT--I COULD FOLLOW NO SCENT VERY FAR
THEY PULLED WITH AN ART OF THEIR OWN THE STRINGS OF MY INVENTION AND MY MEMORY
BUT IT WAS AS IF I HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HIM FOR YEARS AND HAD KNOWN HIM ALWAYS
THEY'VE ONLY TO KEEP TO THEIR SUGGESTIONS OF DANGER FOR THE CHILDREN TO COME AND PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT MRS GROSE SLOWLY GOT UP AND I SCRUPULOUSLY ADDED
BUT HE WAS UNMISTAKABLY MORE CONSCIOUS
NOBODY FROM THE VILLAGE NOBODY--NOBODY
ALL ROUND ABOUT--MILES AND MILES AWAY
IT WASN'T A SCENE FOR A SHUDDER
WHAT HE WOULD NOT PERMIT THIS OFFICE TO CONSIST OF WAS YET TO BE SETTLED
BUT I GAVE MYSELF UP TO IT
IF IT WAS EASY TO REFLECT HOWEVER THAT SUCH A BOY COULD POSTPONE SCHOOL IT WAS AT LEAST AS MARKED THAT FOR SUCH A BOY TO HAVE BEEN KICKED OUT BY A SCHOOLMASTER WAS A MYSTIFICATION WITHOUT END
AH REMEMBER THAT UNTIL FURTHER EVIDENCE I NOW ACCUSE NOBODY THEN BEFORE SHUTTING HER OUT TO GO BY ANOTHER PASSAGE TO HER OWN PLACE I MUST JUST WAIT I WOUND UP
AND I WAS QUICK TO ASSURE HER THAT MY OWN INTEREST IN IT HAD NOW VIOLENTLY TAKEN THE FORM OF A SEARCH FOR THE WAY TO ESCAPE FROM IT
ONE HAD SEEN IT COMING ON THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU GET HER OFF BEFORE BEFORE WHAT BEFORE SHE BECAME TOO ILL TO TRAVEL I FOUND MYSELF PROMPT
BUT ALL THIS BELONGED--I MEAN THEIR MAGNIFICENT LITTLE SURRENDER--JUST TO THE SPECIAL ARRAY OF THE FACTS THAT WERE MOST ABYSMAL
FIXED HER AH WITH SUCH AWFUL EYES SHE STARED AT MINE AS IF THEY MIGHT REALLY HAVE RESEMBLED THEM
THEY FLANKED OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE HOUSE AND WERE PROBABLY ARCHITECTURAL ABSURDITIES REDEEMED IN A MEASURE INDEED BY NOT BEING WHOLLY DISENGAGED NOR OF A HEIGHT TOO PRETENTIOUS DATING IN THEIR GINGERBREAD ANTIQUITY FROM A ROMANTIC REVIVAL THAT WAS ALREADY A RESPECTABLE PAST
HE ARRIVES AS YOU DID BY THE COACH UNDER CARE OF THE GUARD AND IS TO BE MET BY THE SAME CARRIAGE I FORTHWITH EXPRESSED THAT THE PROPER AS WELL AS THE PLEASANT AND FRIENDLY THING WOULD BE THEREFORE THAT ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE PUBLIC CONVEYANCE I SHOULD BE IN WAITING FOR HIM WITH HIS LITTLE SISTER
WHAT WAS SETTLED BETWEEN US ACCORDINGLY THAT NIGHT WAS THAT WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT BEAR THINGS TOGETHER
MY LETTER GIVING THE ALARM WILL HAVE REACHED TOWN BEFORE YOU I NOW PERCEIVED STILL MORE HOW SHE HAD BEEN BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH AND HOW WEARY AT LAST IT HAD MADE HER
HE FOUND THE MOST DIVINE LITTLE WAY TO KEEP ME QUIET WHILE SHE WENT OFF DIVINE MRS GROSE BEWILDEREDLY ECHOED
SHE HESITATED--TOOK A COUPLE OF DAYS TO CONSULT AND CONSIDER
NO ONE IN SHORT COULD BLAME ME IF I SHOULD JUST DRIVE DESPERATELY OFF
THIS TOWER WAS ONE OF A PAIR--SQUARE INCONGRUOUS CRENELATED STRUCTURES--THAT WERE DISTINGUISHED FOR SOME REASON THOUGH I COULD SEE LITTLE DIFFERENCE AS THE NEW AND THE OLD
DARK AS MIDNIGHT IN HER BLACK DRESS HER HAGGARD BEAUTY AND HER UNUTTERABLE WOE SHE HAD LOOKED AT ME LONG ENOUGH TO APPEAR TO SAY THAT HER RIGHT TO SIT AT MY TABLE WAS AS GOOD AS MINE TO SIT AT HERS
DISHONORED AND TRAGIC SHE WAS ALL BEFORE ME
IT DOES STRIKE ME THAT MY PUPILS HAVE NEVER MENTIONED SHE LOOKED AT ME HARD AS I MUSINGLY PULLED UP
THIS WAS ODDLY SO MUCH TO THE GOOD
MY PREDECESSOR--THE ONE WHO DIED MISS JESSEL MISS JESSEL
HOW CAN I IF YOU DON'T IMAGINE I DON'T IN THE VERY LEAST YOU'VE SEEN HIM NOWHERE BUT ON THE TOWER AND ON THIS SPOT JUST NOW MRS GROSE LOOKED ROUND AGAIN
I DON'T MEAN BY THIS OF COURSE THAT WE STUDIED ONLY FICTION AND VERSE
I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING SO HORRIBLE I RECOLLECT SAYING
BLESS HER SHE ADDED THE NEXT MOMENT--"LOOK AT HER I TURNED AND SAW THAT FLORA WHOM TEN MINUTES BEFORE I HAD ESTABLISHED IN THE SCHOOLROOM WITH A SHEET OF WHITE PAPER A PENCIL AND A COPY OF NICE ROUND O'S NOW PRESENTED HERSELF TO VIEW AT THE OPEN DOOR
WOULD YOU MIND MISS IF I USED THE FREEDOM TO KISS ME
AND AFTER ALL IF SHE DOESN'T MIND IT SHE EVEN TRIED A GRIM JOKE
WELL--I SAID THINGS ONLY THAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS ENOUGH TO TURN YOU OUT FOR NEVER TRULY HAD A PERSON TURNED OUT SHOWN SO LITTLE TO EXPLAIN IT AS THIS LITTLE PERSON
I FIND THAT I REALLY HANG BACK
SHE'LL SAY SHE ISN'T--SHE'LL LIE MRS GROSE WAS NOT TOO BEWILDERED INSTINCTIVELY TO PROTEST
AND WHAT IS YOUR REMEDY YOUR LOYALTY TO BEGIN WITH
AND THE SINGULAR RETICENCE OF OUR COMMUNION WAS EVEN MORE MARKED IN THE FRANK LOOK SHE LAUNCHED ME
HOW COULD I KNOW IT DID TROUBLE YOU THIS QUESTION WHEN YOU NEVER TOLD ME SO NEVER SPOKE OF IT AT ALL HIS CLEAR LISTENING FACE FRAMED IN ITS SMOOTH WHITENESS MADE HIM FOR THE MINUTE AS APPEALING AS SOME WISTFUL PATIENT IN A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL
SOMEONE WOULD APPEAR THERE AT THE TURN OF A PATH AND WOULD STAND BEFORE ME AND SMILE AND APPROVE
THE RISK WAS HIDEOUS
DAVID PLAYING TO SAUL COULD NEVER HAVE SHOWN A FINER SENSE OF THE OCCASION
MEANWHILE THE GLARE OF THE FACE WAS AGAIN AT THE WINDOW THE SCOUNDREL FIXED AS IF TO WATCH AND WAIT
YOU MEAN THAT A BOY WHO NEVER IS IS NO BOY FOR ME I HELD HER TIGHTER
YOUR LETTER NEVER WENT WHAT THEN BECAME OF IT GOODNESS KNOWS
A GENTLEMAN SHE GASPED CONFOUNDED STUPEFIED
II THIS CAME HOME TO ME WHEN TWO DAYS LATER I DROVE OVER WITH FLORA TO MEET AS MRS GROSE SAID THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN
HE HAD BROKEN A THICKNESS OF ICE THE FORMATION OF MANY A WINTER
WHAT WILL THEY THINK OF THAT
I WALKED ROUND THE CHURCH HESITATING HOVERING
THEN AS HIS STRANGE SHE STAGGERED ME AND WITH A GASP I ECHOED IT MISS JESSEL MISS JESSEL HE WITH A SUDDEN FURY GAVE ME BACK
AND THE FIGURE THAT FACED ME WAS--A FEW MORE SECONDS ASSURED ME--AS LITTLE ANYONE ELSE I KNEW AS IT WAS THE IMAGE THAT HAD BEEN IN MY MIND
I REMEMBER THAT TO GAIN TIME I TRIED TO LAUGH AND I SEEMED TO SEE IN THE BEAUTIFUL FACE WITH WHICH HE WATCHED ME HOW UGLY AND QUEER I LOOKED
IT WAS PROBABLY AT THE MOST ONLY A SLIGHT OPPRESSION PRODUCED BY A FULLER MEASURE OF THE SCALE AS I WALKED ROUND THEM GAZED UP AT THEM TOOK THEM IN OF MY NEW CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT'S NOTHING--NOW THEN I EXPLAINED
MUCH AS I HAD MADE OF THE FACT THAT THIS NAME HAD NEVER ONCE BETWEEN US BEEN SOUNDED THE QUICK SMITTEN GLARE WITH WHICH THE CHILD'S FACE NOW RECEIVED IT FAIRLY LIKENED MY BREACH OF THE SILENCE TO THE SMASH OF A PANE OF GLASS
I APPLIED MY FACE TO THE PANE AND LOOKED AS HE HAD LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
DID HE PUT THAT TO YOU AS A JUSTIFICATION AT THIS SHE DROPPED AGAIN
NONETHELESS THE REST OF THE DAY I WATCHED FOR FURTHER OCCASION TO APPROACH MY COLLEAGUE ESPECIALLY AS TOWARD EVENING I BEGAN TO FANCY SHE RATHER SOUGHT TO AVOID ME
IN WHICH I DEFINITELY SAW IT TURN AS I MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE LOW WRETCH TO WHICH IT HAD ONCE BELONGED TURN ON RECEIPT OF AN ORDER AND PASS WITH MY EYES ON THE VILLAINOUS BACK THAT NO HUNCH COULD HAVE MORE DISFIGURED STRAIGHT DOWN THE STAIRCASE AND INTO THE DARKNESS IN WHICH THE NEXT BEND WAS LOST
THE LITTLE GIRL WHO ACCOMPANIED MRS GROSE APPEARED TO ME ON THE SPOT A CREATURE SO CHARMING AS TO MAKE IT A GREAT FORTUNE TO HAVE TO DO WITH HER
I INSTANTLY BECAME SURE SHE HAD JUST COME OUT OF THE COPSE
DO YOU MEAN SHE FALTERED OF THE LOST OF THE LOST
PROBABLY NOT TILL THE SECOND POST WELL THEN
DOESN'T IT BETRAY TOO MUCH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO GET INTO A SAD WILD TANGLE ABOUT HOW MUCH I MIGHT BETRAY
BUT HOW COULD YOU BE SURE I WOULD KNOW IT OH I ARRANGED THAT WITH FLORA HIS ANSWERS RANG OUT WITH A READINESS
I CALL IT A REVOLUTION BECAUSE I NOW SEE HOW WITH THE WORD HE SPOKE THE CURTAIN ROSE ON THE LAST ACT OF MY DREADFUL DRAMA AND THE CATASTROPHE WAS PRECIPITATED
HOW ON THE OTHER HAND COULD I MAKE REFERENCE WITHOUT A NEW PLUNGE INTO THE HIDEOUS OBSCURE
HIS STARE INTO MY FACE THROUGH THE GLASS AND ACROSS THE ROOM WAS AS DEEP AND HARD AS THEN BUT IT QUITTED ME FOR A MOMENT DURING WHICH I COULD STILL WATCH IT SEE IT FIX SUCCESSIVELY SEVERAL OTHER THINGS
HER ROUND EYES STARTED AND HER MILD MOUTH GAPED
IT ONLY WENT INDEED A LITTLE WAY
HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN
AND DID IT COME NO THOUGH I WAITED AND WAITED I CONFESS IT DIDN'T AND IT WAS WITHOUT A BREACH OF THE SILENCE OR SO MUCH AS A FAINT ALLUSION TO HIS SISTER'S CONDITION AND ABSENCE THAT WE AT LAST KISSED FOR GOOD NIGHT
WELL PERHAPS I OUGHT TO ALSO--SINCE I'VE HEARD SOME OF IT BEFORE
I SAW HIM FROM THE MIDST OF MY ACT MEET IT WITH A DIVINATION AND ON THE PERCEPTION THAT EVEN NOW HE ONLY GUESSED AND THAT THE WINDOW WAS STILL TO HIS OWN EYES FREE I LET THE IMPULSE FLAME UP TO CONVERT THE CLIMAX OF HIS DISMAY INTO THE VERY PROOF OF HIS LIBERATION
HE WAS ONLY TOO FINE AND FAIR FOR THE LITTLE HORRID UNCLEAN SCHOOL WORLD AND HE HAD PAID A PRICE FOR IT
QUINT WAS MUCH TOO FREE THIS GAVE ME STRAIGHT FROM MY VISION OF HIS FACE--SUCH A FACE!--A SUDDEN SICKNESS OF DISGUST
HE SEEMED TO SAY IT WAS NOT SO SIMPLE AS THAT
SHE LOOKED FOR A MINUTE AS IF SHE SHARPLY SAW THEM TOGETHER
BUT AT THE END OF A MINUTE I BEGAN TO FEEL WHAT IT TRULY WAS THAT I HELD
THIS CHANCE PRESENTED ITSELF TO ME IN AN IMAGE RICHLY MATERIAL
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE BOY THAT SUGGESTED TO YOU I CONTINUED THAT HE COVERED AND CONCEALED THEIR RELATION OH HE COULDN'T PREVENT YOUR LEARNING THE TRUTH
THIS WAS HER ATTITUDE WHEN I AT LAST LOOKED AT HER--LOOKED WITH THE CONFIRMED CONVICTION THAT WE WERE STILL TOGETHER UNDER DIRECT PERSONAL NOTICE
AND NO MOMENT OF MY MONSTROUS TIME WAS PERHAPS SO EXTRAORDINARY AS THAT IN WHICH I CONSCIOUSLY THREW OUT TO HER--WITH THE SENSE THAT PALE AND RAVENOUS DEMON AS SHE WAS SHE WOULD CATCH AND UNDERSTAND IT--AN INARTICULATE MESSAGE OF GRATITUDE
THE MORE READILY FOR MY FULL VISION--ON THE EVIDENCE--OF OUR EMPLOYER'S LATE CLEVER GOOD-LOOKING OWN MAN
NOT ABSOLUTELY
SHE HAS USED IT TO GO OVER AND THEN HAS MANAGED TO HIDE IT ALL ALONE--THAT CHILD SHE'S NOT ALONE AND AT SUCH TIMES SHE'S NOT A CHILD
I CAME HOME MY DEAR I WENT ON FOR A TALK WITH MISS JESSEL I HAD BY THIS TIME FORMED THE HABIT OF HAVING MRS GROSE LITERALLY WELL IN HAND IN ADVANCE OF MY SOUNDING THAT NOTE
THERE WERE EXACTLY STATES OF THE AIR CONDITIONS OF SOUND AND OF STILLNESS UNSPEAKABLE IMPRESSIONS OF THE KIND OF MINISTERING MOMENT THAT BROUGHT BACK TO ME LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH IT THE FEELING OF THE MEDIUM IN WHICH THAT JUNE EVENING OUT OF DOORS I HAD HAD MY FIRST SIGHT OF QUINT AND IN WHICH TOO AT THOSE OTHER INSTANTS I HAD AFTER SEEING HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW LOOKED FOR HIM IN VAIN IN THE CIRCLE OF SHRUBBERY
ON THE OLD TOWER SHE COULD ONLY LOOK AT ME HARDER
THE CHILD HEAVEN FORBID
TO MAKE UP HIS MIND WHAT TO DO WITH YOU
I WAS CARRIED AWAY IN LONDON I CAN STILL SEE MRS GROSE'S BROAD FACE AS SHE TOOK THIS IN
HE LIED OH MRS GROSE MUMBLED
AND IF I ONCE MORE CLOSED MY EYES IT WAS BEFORE THE DAZZLE OF THE THREE OR FOUR POSSIBLE WAYS IN WHICH I MIGHT TAKE THIS UP
THE BOY GAVE A LOUD HIGH SHRIEK WHICH LOST IN THE REST OF THE SHOCK OF SOUND MIGHT HAVE SEEMED INDISTINCTLY THOUGH I WAS SO CLOSE TO HIM A NOTE EITHER OF JUBILATION OR OF TERROR
THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW ON THE SPOT BETWEEN US AND HE WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT I RECOGNIZED IT THOUGH TO ENABLE ME TO DO SO HE HAD NO NEED TO LOOK A WHIT LESS CANDID AND CHARMING THAN USUAL
THIS WAS A LARGE SQUARE CHAMBER ARRANGED WITH SOME STATE AS A BEDROOM THE EXTRAVAGANT SIZE OF WHICH MADE IT SO INCONVENIENT THAT IT HAD NOT FOR YEARS THOUGH KEPT BY MRS GROSE IN EXEMPLARY ORDER BEEN OCCUPIED
IF UNMOLESTED ONE COULD CALL A YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE SENSIBILITY HAD IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY FASHION NOT DECLINED BUT DEEPENED
YET SHE ACCEPTED WITHOUT DIRECTLY IMPUGNING MY SANITY THE TRUTH AS I GAVE IT TO HER AND ENDED BY SHOWING ME ON THIS GROUND AN AWESTRICKEN TENDERNESS AN EXPRESSION OF THE SENSE OF MY MORE THAN QUESTIONABLE PRIVILEGE OF WHICH THE VERY BREATH HAS REMAINED WITH ME AS THAT OF THE SWEETEST OF HUMAN CHARITIES
THIS BROUGHT ME TO MY FEET AND STRAIGHT IN THE DARKNESS TO HER BED WHICH I FOUND SHE HAD LEFT
WERE I TO GET OFF QUICKLY THIS WAY I SHOULD GET OFF WITHOUT A SCENE WITHOUT A WORD
THE ATTRACTION OF MY SMALL CHARGES WAS A CONSTANT JOY LEADING ME TO WONDER AFRESH AT THE VANITY OF MY ORIGINAL FEARS THE DISTASTE I HAD BEGUN BY ENTERTAINING FOR THE PROBABLE GRAY PROSE OF MY OFFICE
WHAT ELSE SHOULD I STAY ON FOR HE LOOKED AT ME MORE DIRECTLY AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE GRAVER NOW STRUCK ME AS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL I HAD EVER FOUND IN IT
WAKING HER NOT TO DISSIPATE HIS DREAD AND SOOTHE HIM TO SLEEP AGAIN BUT TO ENCOUNTER ALSO HERSELF BEFORE SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN DOING SO THE SAME SIGHT THAT HAD SHAKEN HIM
WE SAT THERE IN ABSOLUTE STILLNESS
MY GOING WOULD SEEM THE RIGHT THING AND ON SUNDAY I WAS TERRIBLY NEAR IT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DON'T SEE--WHAT I DON'T FEAR MRS GROSE TRIED TO KEEP UP WITH ME
I FOUND NOTHING AT ALL AND HE WAS THEREFORE AN ANGEL
NOTHING AT ALL THAT I KNOW TOUCHES IT FOR SHEER TERROR I REMEMBER ASKING
TRY MEANWHILE YOURSELF UPSTAIRS WITH THEM OH ON THIS THE POOR WOMAN PROMPTLY JOINED ME
WE WERE UNITED IN OUR DANGER
THE JOURNEY WILL DISSIPATE THE INFLUENCE"--OH I WAS GRAND!--"AND CARRY IT OFF I SEE I SEE"--MILES FOR THAT MATTER WAS GRAND TOO
THEN I ASKED HIM IF THE EXPERIENCE IN QUESTION HAD BEEN HIS OWN
NEVER BY A SLIP OF THE TONGUE HAVE THEY SO MUCH AS ALLUDED TO EITHER OF THEIR OLD FRIENDS ANY MORE THAN MILES HAS ALLUDED TO HIS EXPULSION
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
QUINT SHE CRIED
FINALLY I WENT OUT TAKING A CANDLE
GOODBYE FOR MRS GROSE I HAD AN IMPERATIVE AN ALMOST FRANTIC GO GO BEFORE WHICH IN INFINITE DISTRESS BUT MUTELY POSSESSED OF THE LITTLE GIRL AND CLEARLY CONVINCED IN SPITE OF HER BLINDNESS THAT SOMETHING AWFUL HAD OCCURRED AND SOME COLLAPSE ENGULFED US SHE RETREATED BY THE WAY WE HAD COME AS FAST AS SHE COULD MOVE
SEATED AT MY OWN TABLE IN CLEAR NOONDAY LIGHT I SAW A PERSON WHOM WITHOUT MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN AT THE FIRST BLUSH FOR SOME HOUSEMAID WHO MIGHT HAVE STAYED AT HOME TO LOOK AFTER THE PLACE AND WHO AVAILING HERSELF OF RARE RELIEF FROM OBSERVATION AND OF THE SCHOOLROOM TABLE AND MY PENS INK AND PAPER HAD APPLIED HERSELF TO THE CONSIDERABLE EFFORT OF A LETTER TO HER SWEETHEART
HE TOLD HER FRANKLY ALL HIS DIFFICULTY--THAT FOR SEVERAL APPLICANTS THE CONDITIONS HAD BEEN PROHIBITIVE
I COULDN'T--AND I CAN'T NOW AND THE POOR WOMAN BURST INTO TEARS
THAT KEPT US A LITTLE LONGER SUSPENDED AND UNBRUISED
WHAT I WAS DOING WAS WHAT HE HAD EARNESTLY HOPED AND DIRECTLY ASKED OF ME AND THAT I COULD AFTER ALL DO IT PROVED EVEN A GREATER JOY THAN I HAD EXPECTED
WHY IT WAS TO SHOW YOU I COULD OH YES YOU COULD AND I CAN AGAIN I FELT THAT I MIGHT PERHAPS AFTER ALL SUCCEED IN KEEPING MY WITS ABOUT ME
THEN I CAUGHT THE SUPPRESSED INTELLECTUAL CREAK WITH WHICH SHE CONSCIENTIOUSLY TURNED TO TAKE FROM ME A VIEW OF THE BACK OF THE TAPESTRY
THERE WAS A GREAT STILL MOON TO HELP HER AND THIS FACT HAD COUNTED IN MY QUICK DECISION
I BOUNDED STRAIGHT OUT OF THE DOOR AGAIN REACHED THAT OF THE HOUSE GOT IN AN INSTANT UPON THE DRIVE AND PASSING ALONG THE TERRACE AS FAST AS I COULD RUSH TURNED A CORNER AND CAME FULL IN SIGHT
IT BROUGHT OUT AGAIN ALL HER COMPASSION FOR ME AND AT THE RENEWED TOUCH OF HER KINDNESS MY POWER TO RESIST BROKE DOWN
IT WAS A PITY TO BE OBLIGED TO REINVESTIGATE THE CERTITUDE OF THE MOMENT ITSELF AND REPEAT HOW IT HAD COME TO ME AS A REVELATION THAT THE INCONCEIVABLE COMMUNION I THEN SURPRISED WAS A MATTER FOR EITHER PARTY OF HABIT
HOW COULD I PUT EVEN A LITTLE OF THAT ARTICLE INTO A SUPPRESSION OF REFERENCE TO WHAT HAD OCCURRED
AND IT CONSISTED--IN PART AT LEAST--OF HIS COMING IN AT ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND SITTING DOWN WITH ME IN SILENCE
I ENCOUNTERED HER ON THE GROUND OF A PROBABILITY THAT WITH RECURRENCE--FOR RECURRENCE WE TOOK FOR GRANTED--I SHOULD GET USED TO MY DANGER DISTINCTLY PROFESSING THAT MY PERSONAL EXPOSURE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME THE LEAST OF MY DISCOMFORTS
I APPROACHED IT FROM ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER WHILE IN MY ROOM I FLUNG MYSELF ABOUT BUT I ALWAYS BROKE DOWN IN THE MONSTROUS UTTERANCE OF NAMES
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE I CAN STILL SEE HIS WONDERFUL SMILE THE WHITES OF HIS BEAUTIFUL EYES AND THE UNCOVERING OF HIS LITTLE TEETH SHINE TO ME IN THE DUSK
I WAS OF COURSE THOROUGHLY KIND AND MERCIFUL
BUT I SO FAR SUCCEEDED IN CHECKING THE EXPRESSION OF THIS VIEW THAT I WILL THROW JUST HERE NO FURTHER LIGHT ON IT THAN MAY BE OFFERED BY THE MENTION OF MY FINAL OBSERVATION TO MRS GROSE
HER LITTLE BELONGINGS HAD ALL BEEN REMOVED
FROM YOU--FROM YOU SHE CRIED
THEY WANT TO GET TO THEM OH HOW AT THIS POOR MRS GROSE APPEARED TO STUDY THEM
YOUNG AS SHE WAS I WAS STRUCK THROUGHOUT OUR LITTLE TOUR WITH HER CONFIDENCE AND COURAGE WITH THE WAY IN EMPTY CHAMBERS AND DULL CORRIDORS ON CROOKED STAIRCASES THAT MADE ME PAUSE AND EVEN ON THE SUMMIT OF AN OLD MACHICOLATED SQUARE TOWER THAT MADE ME DIZZY HER MORNING MUSIC HER DISPOSITION TO TELL ME SO MANY MORE THINGS THAN SHE ASKED RANG OUT AND LED ME ON
I FIGURE FINALLY THAT THE WHITE CURTAIN DRAPING IN THE FASHION OF THOSE DAYS THE HEAD OF FLORA'S LITTLE BED SHROUDED AS I HAD ASSURED MYSELF LONG BEFORE THE PERFECTION OF CHILDISH REST
BUT I HAD LIVED BY THIS TIME TOO LONG AMONG WONDERS AND HAD PANTED TO TOO MANY LIVELIER MEASURES
THAT REMINDER HAD AS LITTLE EFFECT ON MY PRACTICAL CERTITUDE AS I WAS CONSCIOUS--STILL EVEN WITHOUT LOOKING--OF ITS HAVING UPON THE CHARACTER AND ATTITUDE OF OUR VISITOR
WHAT HAD HIS INTELLIGENCE BEEN GIVEN HIM FOR BUT TO SAVE HIM
WELL THEN GO TO LUKE AND I'LL WAIT FOR WHAT YOU PROMISE
I HAD THEN TO COME BACK TO MEET A FRIEND SHE SHOWED HER SURPRISE
AND THE ONLY WAY TO BE SURE HE KNEW WOULD BE TO SEE IT AND THE KIND LIGHT OF IT IN HIS HANDSOME FACE
ON WHICH I HAD TAKEN HIS HAND WITHOUT A WORD AND LED HIM THROUGH THE DARK SPACES UP THE STAIRCASE WHERE QUINT HAD SO HUNGRILY HOVERED FOR HIM ALONG THE LOBBY WHERE I HAD LISTENED AND TREMBLED AND SO TO HIS FORSAKEN ROOM
THEY CAN DESTROY THEM AT THIS MY COMPANION DID TURN BUT THE INQUIRY SHE LAUNCHED WAS A SILENT ONE THE EFFECT OF WHICH WAS TO MAKE ME MORE EXPLICIT
I ARRANGED WITH HER TO HER GREAT SATISFACTION THAT IT SHOULD BE SHE SHE ONLY WHO MIGHT SHOW ME THE PLACE
WHY JUST FOR THAT
IF SHE HADN'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE BECOME OF ME FOR I COULDN'T HAVE BORNE THE BUSINESS ALONE
I SAY COURAGE BECAUSE I WAS BEYOND ALL DOUBT ALREADY FAR GONE
IT WAS CONSPICUOUS OF COURSE IN MILES IN PARTICULAR THAT HE APPEARED TO WISH TO SHOW HOW EASILY HE COULD LET ME DOWN
WELL I COME YOU SEE--BUT I DON'T GO
I FOUND HER WHERE I HAD FOUND HER THE EVENING BEFORE BUT SHE MET MY QUICK CHALLENGE WITH BLANK SCARED IGNORANCE
GOD KNOWS I NEVER WISHED TO HARASS HIM BUT I FELT THAT MERELY AT THIS TO TURN MY BACK ON HIM WAS TO ABANDON OR TO PUT IT MORE TRULY TO LOSE HIM
YOU SEE HOW HE COULD SEE I MEANWHILE WENT ON
AND DURING THE MINUTE ACCORDINGLY THE THING WAS AS HUMAN AND HIDEOUS AS A REAL INTERVIEW
HE WAS THERE OR WAS NOT THERE
MUCH AS I LIKED MY COMPANIONS THIS HOUR WAS THE THING IN THE DAY I LIKED MOST
IT WAS NOT AGAINST THE POSSIBLE RE-ENTRANCE OF MISS JESSEL ON THE SCENE THAT SHE PROTESTED--IT WAS CONSPICUOUSLY AND PASSIONATELY AGAINST MINE
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THEY'D TELL THE MASTERS
THE RIGOR WITH WHICH I KEPT MY PUPILS IN SIGHT MAKING IT OFTEN DIFFICULT TO MEET HER PRIVATELY AND THE MORE AS WE EACH FELT THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT PROVOKING--ON THE PART OF THE SERVANTS QUITE AS MUCH AS ON THAT OF THE CHILDREN--ANY SUSPICION OF A SECRET FLURRY OR THAT OF A DISCUSSION OF MYSTERIES
THE NIGHT HAD BROUGHT A TOUCH OF FROST AND THE AUTUMN AIR BRIGHT AND SHARP MADE THE CHURCH BELLS ALMOST GAY
AND YOU COULD BEAR IT NO
ALL THE JUSTICE WITHIN ME ACHED FOR THE PROOF THAT IT COULD EVER HAVE FLOWERED INTO AN ACT
YET IT ISN'T EITHER I MUST SAY AS IF I MUCH NEEDED TO
IT LASTED WHILE THIS VISITANT AT ALL EVENTS--AND THERE WAS A TOUCH OF THE STRANGE FREEDOM AS I REMEMBER IN THE SIGN OF FAMILIARITY OF HIS WEARING NO HAT--SEEMED TO FIX ME FROM HIS POSITION WITH JUST THE QUESTION JUST THE SCRUTINY THROUGH THE FADING LIGHT THAT HIS OWN PRESENCE PROVOKED
THEN I HAD MADE MY CHOICE
HE DENIED LORD HOW I PRESSED HER NOW
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
V OH SHE LET ME KNOW AS SOON AS ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE SHE LOOMED AGAIN INTO VIEW
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND
AWAY FROM THEM
THE POND OBLONG IN SHAPE HAD A WIDTH SO SCANT COMPARED TO ITS LENGTH THAT WITH ITS ENDS OUT OF VIEW IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR A SCANT RIVER
I HAVE LIKENED IT TO A SENTINEL BUT ITS SLOW WHEEL FOR A MOMENT WAS RATHER THE PROWL OF A BAFFLED BEAST
WHAT HAS HE DONE I HESITATED
THE MAN WHO MET MY EYES WAS NOT THE PERSON I HAD PRECIPITATELY SUPPOSED
HE HAS BEEN AN IMPERTURBABLE LITTLE PRODIGY OF DELIGHTFUL LOVABLE GOODNESS
BUT WHAT THINGS THE THINGS YOU'VE NEVER TOLD ME
THEN IN SPITE OF YESTERDAY YOU BELIEVE IN SUCH DOINGS HER SIMPLE DESCRIPTION OF THEM REQUIRED IN THE LIGHT OF HER EXPRESSION TO BE CARRIED NO FURTHER AND SHE GAVE ME THE WHOLE THING AS SHE HAD NEVER DONE
DON'T BE AFRAID I CONTINUED TO THINK
IT HAD BEEN INTENTIONALLY LEFT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE OUT OF SIGHT AND WAS TIED TO ONE OF THE STAKES OF A FENCE THAT CAME JUST THERE DOWN TO THE BRINK AND THAT HAD BEEN AN ASSISTANCE TO DISEMBARKING
THEREFORE YOU MIGHT PERFECTLY HAVE MADE THE CLAIM FOR HIM IF YOU HAD NOT AS IT HAPPENED SEEN AN EXCEPTION TO TAKE
AS THEY DIED AWAY ON MY LIPS I SAID TO MYSELF THAT I SHOULD INDEED HELP THEM TO REPRESENT SOMETHING INFAMOUS IF BY PRONOUNCING THEM I SHOULD VIOLATE AS RARE A LITTLE CASE OF INSTINCTIVE DELICACY AS ANY SCHOOLROOM PROBABLY HAD EVER KNOWN
SHE'S THERE SHE'S THERE MISS JESSEL STOOD BEFORE US ON THE OPPOSITE BANK EXACTLY AS SHE HAD STOOD THE OTHER TIME AND I REMEMBER STRANGELY AS THE FIRST FEELING NOW PRODUCED IN ME MY THRILL OF JOY AT HAVING BROUGHT ON A PROOF
IT'S HE I WAS SO DETERMINED TO HAVE ALL MY PROOF THAT I FLASHED INTO ICE TO CHALLENGE HIM
AND YET EVEN TO THIS COMPLICATION THE LATER HOURS OF THE DAY HAD BROUGHT A LITTLE EASE
I WALKED IN A WORLD OF THEIR INVENTION--THEY HAD NO OCCASION WHATEVER TO DRAW UPON MINE
IT WAS IN ANY CASE OVER MY LIFE MY PAST AND MY FRIENDS ALONE THAT WE COULD TAKE ANYTHING LIKE OUR EASE--A STATE OF AFFAIRS THAT LED THEM SOMETIMES WITHOUT THE LEAST PERTINENCE TO BREAK OUT INTO SOCIABLE REMINDERS
I MUST HAVE LAIN THERE LONG AND CRIED AND SOBBED FOR WHEN I RAISED MY HEAD THE DAY WAS ALMOST DONE
IT ALL LIES IN HALF A DOZEN WORDS I SAID TO HER WORDS THAT REALLY SETTLE THE MATTER
SHE JUST APPEARED AND STOOD THERE--BUT NOT SO NEAR AND WITHOUT COMING NEARER OH FOR THE EFFECT AND THE FEELING SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS CLOSE AS YOU MY FRIEND WITH AN ODD IMPULSE FELL BACK A STEP
I'LL GET IT OUT OF HIM
OH HOW I LOOKED AT HER NOW
IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT DREW FROM DOUGLAS--NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING--A REPLY THAT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THE MISERABLE TRUTH AND NOW IT HAS ONLY TOO MUCH CLOSED ROUND ME
HIS EYES ARE SHARP STRANGE--AWFULLY
BUT EVEN AS I FIXED AND FOR MEMORY SECURED IT THE AWFUL IMAGE PASSED AWAY
WHEN MRS GROSE FINALLY GOT UP SHE KEPT THE CHILD'S HAND SO THAT THE TWO WERE STILL BEFORE ME
THAT CAN HAVE ONLY ONE MEANING MRS GROSE LISTENED WITH DUMB EMOTION
THE FOUR DEPEND UPON IT PERPETUALLY MEET
BEFORE I HAD TIME TO DEAL WITH THAT HOWEVER HE CONTINUED AS IF WITH THE SENSE THAT THIS WAS AN IMPERTINENCE TO BE SOFTENED
I RECALL ONE OF THE LAST THINGS I SAID THAT NIGHT TO MRS GROSE
I'VE JUST BEGUN A LETTER TO YOUR UNCLE I SAID
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BUT SO I SUPPOSE THEM
I ALLUDE TO MY UNNATURAL COMPOSURE ON THE SUBJECT OF ANOTHER SCHOOL FOR MILES
HE MIGHT BE INNOCENT
THERE WAS A GATE IN THE FENCE THROUGH WHICH WE PASSED AND THAT BROUGHT US AFTER A TRIFLING INTERVAL MORE INTO THE OPEN
HE GAVE AT ANY RATE LIKE A CONVALESCENT SLIGHTLY FATIGUED A LANGUID SHAKE OF HIS HEAD
I MAKE OUT NOW WHAT HE MUST HAVE DONE AT SCHOOL AND SHE GAVE IN HER SIMPLE SHARPNESS AN ALMOST DROLL DISILLUSIONED NOD
BUT DOUGLAS WITHOUT HEEDING ME HAD BEGUN TO READ WITH A FINE CLEARNESS THAT WAS LIKE A RENDERING TO THE EAR OF THE BEAUTY OF HIS AUTHOR'S HAND
MY DEAR WOMAN LOOK AT HIM SHE SMILED AT MY PRETENTION TO HAVE DISCOVERED HIS CHARM
ONLY MEET ALL QUESTIONS HERSELF RECEIVE ALL MONEYS FROM HIS SOLICITOR TAKE THE WHOLE THING OVER AND LET HIM ALONE
HE MUST TAKE THEM AWAY AND WHO'S TO MAKE HIM SHE HAD BEEN SCANNING THE DISTANCE BUT SHE NOW DROPPED ON ME A FOOLISH FACE
THEN IT WAS THAT THE OTHERS THE OUTSIDERS WERE THERE
SHE CONCEIVED HIM AS RICH BUT AS FEARFULLY EXTRAVAGANT--SAW HIM ALL IN A GLOW OF HIGH FASHION OF GOOD LOOKS OF EXPENSIVE HABITS OF CHARMING WAYS WITH WOMEN
XXI BEFORE A NEW DAY IN MY ROOM HAD FULLY BROKEN MY EYES OPENED TO MRS GROSE WHO HAD COME TO MY BEDSIDE WITH WORSE NEWS
AFTER WHICH SHE ADDED
THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW I WAS THERE--I SAW WITH MY EYES
I SPEAK OF SEQUENCES BUT I REQUIRED NO LAPSE OF SECONDS TO STIFFEN MYSELF FOR A THIRD ENCOUNTER WITH QUINT
LATE THAT NIGHT WHILE THE HOUSE SLEPT WE HAD ANOTHER TALK IN MY ROOM WHEN SHE WENT ALL THE WAY WITH ME AS TO ITS BEING BEYOND DOUBT THAT I HAD SEEN EXACTLY WHAT I HAD SEEN
HE WRITES AND SHOULD YOU LIKE HIM TO WRITE OUR STORY MY QUESTION HAD A SARCASTIC FORCE THAT I HAD NOT FULLY INTENDED AND IT MADE HER AFTER A MOMENT INCONSEQUENTLY BREAK DOWN
NOTHING SHE GAVE WITH HER APRON A GREAT WIPE TO HER MOUTH
I HAVE THEM ALL TO THIS HOUR
IF IT WAS A QUESTION OF A SCARE MY DISCOVERY ON THIS OCCASION HAD SCARED ME MORE THAN ANY OTHER AND IT WAS IN THE CONDITION OF NERVES PRODUCED BY IT THAT I MADE MY ACTUAL INDUCTIONS
THE REVELATION THEN OF THE MANNER IN WHICH FLORA WAS AFFECTED STARTLED ME IN TRUTH FAR MORE THAN IT WOULD HAVE DONE TO FIND HER ALSO MERELY AGITATED FOR DIRECT DISMAY WAS OF COURSE NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
IT WAS NOT I AM AS SURE TODAY AS I WAS SURE THEN MY MERE INFERNAL IMAGINATION
I KNEW IT--BUT THE MASTER DIDN'T AND YOU NEVER TOLD HIM WELL HE DIDN'T LIKE TALE-BEARING--HE HATED COMPLAINTS
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE SMALL VALOR OF IT THAT QUITE FINISHED ME
WHAT WAS IT TO GET AWAY IF I GOT AWAY ONLY TILL DINNER
WELL A SORT OF ANSWER AFTER A TIME HAD COME TO ME AND IT WAS SO FAR CONFIRMED AS THAT I WAS MET INCONTESTABLY BY THE QUICKENED VISION OF WHAT WAS RARE IN MY LITTLE COMPANION
THAT FOR MYSELF WAS A SOUND SIMPLIFICATION
WHERE THEY ARE IN MY EARS STILL HIS SUPREME SURRENDER OF THE NAME AND HIS TRIBUTE TO MY DEVOTION
I WINCED AT MY MISTAKE WHICH I ATTENUATED AS I COULD AND OPENED MY LETTER AGAIN TO REPEAT IT TO HER
I BELIEVE YES IT WAS A JOY AND WE WERE STILL SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
ONLY YOU HAVEN'T MY DREADFUL BOLDNESS OF MIND AND YOU KEEP BACK OUT OF TIMIDITY AND MODESTY AND DELICACY EVEN THE IMPRESSION THAT IN THE PAST WHEN YOU HAD WITHOUT MY AID TO FLOUNDER ABOUT IN SILENCE MOST OF ALL MADE YOU MISERABLE
AND NATURALLY YOU TAKE IT FROM HER STILL I DON'T CONTRADICT HER
THE FACT TO BE IN POSSESSION OF WAS THEREFORE THAT HIS OLD FRIEND THE YOUNGEST OF SEVERAL DAUGHTERS OF A POOR COUNTRY PARSON HAD AT THE AGE OF TWENTY ON TAKING SERVICE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE SCHOOLROOM COME UP TO LONDON IN TREPIDATION TO ANSWER IN PERSON AN ADVERTISEMENT THAT HAD ALREADY PLACED HER IN BRIEF CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE ADVERTISER
YET I STILL HEAR MYSELF CRY AS I FAIRLY THREW MYSELF INTO HER ARMS
ONLY IN RETURN FOR THAT SATISFY BEFORE YOU LEAVE ME ONE VERY MUCH SMALLER REQUEST HE LOOKED AS IF HE FELT HE HAD SUCCEEDED ENOUGH TO BE ABLE STILL A LITTLE TO BARGAIN
AND WHERE'S MASTER MILES OH HE'S WITH QUINT
AT ALL EVENTS WHILE HE WAS WITH THE MAN MISS FLORA WAS WITH THE WOMAN
THE FAULT'S MINE SHE HAD TURNED QUITE PALE
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN A MANNER THAT I HAD KNOWN SPACE AND AIR AND FREEDOM ALL THE MUSIC OF SUMMER AND ALL THE MYSTERY OF NATURE
I HAD SIMPLY GONE STRAIGHT TO MY ROOM TO CHANGE WHAT I WAS WEARING AND TO TAKE IN AT A GLANCE MUCH MATERIAL TESTIMONY TO FLORA'S RUPTURE
THIS FIRST VIVIDNESS OF VISION AND EMOTION WERE THINGS OF A FEW SECONDS DURING WHICH MRS GROSE'S DAZED BLINK ACROSS TO WHERE I POINTED STRUCK ME AS A SOVEREIGN SIGN THAT SHE TOO AT LAST SAW JUST AS IT CARRIED MY OWN EYES PRECIPITATELY TO THE CHILD
ON INNOCENT LITTLE PRECIOUS LIVES
I FELT THAT I SAW HIM AT ANY RATE SHUT IN OR SHUT OUT
HE WAS THE SAME--HE WAS THE SAME AND SEEN THIS TIME AS HE HAD BEEN SEEN BEFORE FROM THE WAIST UP THE WINDOW THOUGH THE DINING ROOM WAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR NOT GOING DOWN TO THE TERRACE ON WHICH HE STOOD
THAT'S WHAT HE GAVE THEM A TASTE OF AT SCHOOL LORD YOU DO CHANGE CRIED MY FRIEND
INSTEAD OF SUCCUMBING I SPRANG AGAIN TO MY FEET LOOKED AT HER BED AND TOOK A HELPLESS MIDDLE WAY
IS HE STUPID
WAS SHE SOMEONE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN YES
IT WAS AFTER LUNCHEON AND BY THE SCHOOLROOM FIRE AND YET I HADN'T REALLY IN THE LEAST SLEPT
IT WAS THE IDEA THE SECOND MOVEMENT THAT LED ME STRAIGHT OUT AS I MAY SAY OF THE INNER CHAMBER OF MY DREAD
THE MASTER BELIEVED IN HIM AND PLACED HIM HERE BECAUSE HE WAS SUPPOSED NOT TO BE WELL AND THE COUNTRY AIR SO GOOD FOR HIM
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WE HAD THEN A YOUNG WOMAN--A NURSEMAID WHO HAD STAYED ON AND WHO WAS A GOOD GIRL AND CLEVER
IT'S NOT MISS JESSEL
WE WERE CONFRONTED ACROSS OUR DISTANCE QUITE LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO ASK MYSELF WITH INTENSITY WHO THEN HE WAS AND TO FEEL AS AN EFFECT OF MY INABILITY TO SAY A WONDER THAT IN A FEW INSTANTS MORE BECAME INTENSE
I TREMBLED LEST THEY SHOULD SEE THAT THEY WERE SO IMMENSELY MORE INTERESTING
SHE DO HAVE A GRAND MANNER ABOUT IT AND THAT MANNER"--I SUMMED IT UP--"IS PRACTICALLY WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER NOW OH THAT MANNER I COULD SEE IN MY VISITOR'S FACE AND NOT A LITTLE ELSE BESIDES
ARE YOU AFRAID HE'LL CORRUPT YOU SHE PUT THE QUESTION WITH SUCH A FINE BOLD HUMOR THAT WITH A LAUGH A LITTLE SILLY DOUBTLESS TO MATCH HER OWN I GAVE WAY FOR THE TIME TO THE APPREHENSION OF RIDICULE
REMARKABLY AND DRESSED IN SOMEBODY'S CLOTHES THEY'RE SMART BUT THEY'RE NOT HIS OWN SHE BROKE INTO A BREATHLESS AFFIRMATIVE GROAN
I WAS INVITED--WITH NO VISIBLE CONNECTION--TO REPEAT AFRESH GOODY GOSLING'S CELEBRATED MOT OR TO CONFIRM THE DETAILS ALREADY SUPPLIED AS TO THE CLEVERNESS OF THE VICARAGE PONY
BUT--AND THIS IS ANOTHER MATTER--I RENEW WHAT I MYSELF SUFFERED I AGAIN PUSH MY WAY THROUGH IT TO THE END
IF HE CONFESSES HE'S SAVED
IT MUST HAVE BEEN ALSO WHAT SHE WISHED MRS GROSE'S FACE SIGNIFIED THAT IT HAD BEEN INDEED BUT SHE SAID AT THE SAME TIME
AND IT WAS HIS ANSWER FOR ONE THING THAT WAS BAD AND FOR ANOTHER THING I WAITED
I HAD AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT I SHOULD SEE AGAIN WHAT I HAD ALREADY SEEN BUT SOMETHING WITHIN ME SAID THAT BY OFFERING MYSELF BRAVELY AS THE SOLE SUBJECT OF SUCH EXPERIENCE BY ACCEPTING BY INVITING BY SURMOUNTING IT ALL I SHOULD SERVE AS AN EXPIATORY VICTIM AND GUARD THE TRANQUILITY OF MY COMPANIONS
LEAVE US LEAVE US"--I WAS ALREADY AT THE DOOR HURRYING HER OFF
OF THE DAMNED
SO HOW THE DEUCE WOULD HE GET OUT OF IT
AND YOU TELL ME THEY WERE GREAT FRIENDS OH IT WASN'T HIM MRS GROSE WITH EMPHASIS DECLARED
AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THESE THINGS ONLY MADE THEM MORE INTERESTING WAS NOT BY ITSELF A DIRECT AID TO KEEPING THEM IN THE DARK
THEN IT WAS--WITH THE VERY ACT OF ITS ANNOUNCING ITSELF--THAT HER IDENTITY FLARED UP IN A CHANGE OF POSTURE
SUCH THINGS ARE NOT FOR ME MISS MY COUNSELOR COULDN'T READ
NEVER NEVER YET HAD I PLACED ON HIS LITTLE SHOULDERS HANDS OF SUCH TENDERNESS AS THOSE WITH WHICH WHILE I RESTED AGAINST THE BED I HELD HIM THERE WELL UNDER FIRE
THEN AS HE FACED US AGAIN
SHE HAS GONE OUT MRS GROSE STARED
THERE WAS TO BE NO GRAY PROSE IT APPEARED AND NO LONG GRIND
I PROMISE YOU I WOULD HAVE TOLD SHE FELT MY DISCRIMINATION
I REMAINED WHERE I WAS AND WHILE I WAITED I THOUGHT OF MORE THINGS THAN ONE
BUT I MEAN DOES HE KNOW KNOW WHAT MILES WHY THE WAY I'M GOING ON I PERCEIVED QUICKLY ENOUGH THAT I COULD MAKE TO THIS INQUIRY NO ANSWER THAT WOULD NOT INVOLVE SOMETHING OF A SACRIFICE OF MY EMPLOYER
IT WAS LONG AGO AND THIS EPISODE WAS LONG BEFORE
HE DIED DIED I ALMOST SHRIEKED
SHE WAS A MOST CHARMING PERSON BUT SHE WAS TEN YEARS OLDER THAN I
I SUSTAINED HER WITH A GRATEFUL ARM ASSURING HER THAT SHE MIGHT HUGELY HELP ME
BUT HE CLEARLY GAINED TIME
WHAT THEY GAVE ME ABOVE ALL WAS JUST THE SINISTER FIGURE OF THE LIVING MAN--THE DEAD ONE WOULD KEEP AWHILE!--AND OF THE MONTHS HE HAD CONTINUOUSLY PASSED AT BLY WHICH ADDED UP MADE A FORMIDABLE STRETCH
BUT THE PRESENCE ON THE LAWN WAS NOT IN THE LEAST WHAT I HAD CONCEIVED AND HAD CONFIDENTLY HURRIED TO MEET
SHE HUNG FIRE BUT SHE OVERCAME HER RELUCTANCE
BUT I COULD LITERALLY--FOR THE TIME AT ALL EVENTS--REJOICE UNDER THIS FATHOMLESS CHARITY THAT THEY HAD NOT ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED
WHAT THEN DID YOU DO HE LOOKED IN VAGUE PAIN ALL ROUND THE TOP OF THE ROOM AND DREW HIS BREATH TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER AS IF WITH DIFFICULTY
HE HAD NEVER AT ANY RATE BEEN SUCH A LITTLE GENTLEMAN AS WHEN AFTER OUR EARLY DINNER ON THIS DREADFUL DAY HE CAME ROUND TO ME AND ASKED IF I SHOULDN'T LIKE HIM FOR HALF AN HOUR TO PLAY TO ME
IT'S JUST WHAT HE WOULDN'T SHE COULD STILL IMPRESS UPON ME
THERE HAD BEEN THIS EVENING AFTER THE REVELATION LEFT ME FOR AN HOUR SO PROSTRATE--THERE HAD BEEN FOR EITHER OF US NO ATTENDANCE ON ANY SERVICE BUT A LITTLE SERVICE OF TEARS AND VOWS OF PRAYERS AND PROMISES A CLIMAX TO THE SERIES OF MUTUAL CHALLENGES AND PLEDGES THAT HAD STRAIGHTWAY ENSUED ON OUR RETREATING TOGETHER TO THE SCHOOLROOM AND SHUTTING OURSELVES UP THERE TO HAVE EVERYTHING OUT
AND YOU FOUND NOTHING!"--I LET MY ELATION OUT
THE FOREMOST THING I SAW THERE BY THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLE I HAD LEFT BURNING WAS THAT FLORA'S LITTLE BED WAS EMPTY
YET HOW OFTEN AND HOW PASSIONATELY FOR A WEEK WE CAME BACK TOGETHER TO THE SUBJECT
TELL ME HOW YOU KNOW MY FRIEND SIMPLY REPEATED
BUT IT STRENGTHENED THE PANG WITH WHICH I AT THAT MOMENT ENVIED MRS GROSE THE SIMPLICITY OF HER RELATION
IT NEVER HAPPILY DIES OUT
BUT WITH MY CHILDREN WHAT THINGS IN THE WORLD MATTERED
THEY HAD SHOWN ME FROM THE FIRST A FACILITY FOR EVERYTHING A GENERAL FACULTY WHICH TAKING A FRESH START ACHIEVED REMARKABLE FLIGHTS
WASN'T IT BASE TO CREATE FOR A BEING SO EXQUISITE A MERE ALIEN AWKWARDNESS
AND WHILE SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING OUT I COMPLETED MY STATEMENT
YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T!"--HE LAY BEAUTIFULLY STARING
THE ANSWER TO MY APPEAL WAS INSTANTANEOUS BUT IT CAME IN THE FORM OF AN EXTRAORDINARY BLAST AND CHILL A GUST OF FROZEN AIR AND A SHAKE OF THE ROOM AS GREAT AS IF IN THE WILD WIND THE CASEMENT HAD CRASHED IN
MY APPREHENSION OF WHAT SHE WAS DOING SUSTAINED ME SO THAT AFTER SOME SECONDS I FELT I WAS READY FOR MORE
I WAS DAZZLED BY THEIR LOVELINESS
ABOUT SOME THINGS--YES BUT NOT ABOUT ALL AGAIN SHE CONSIDERED
AND I CAN GIVE NO INTELLIGIBLE ACCOUNT OF HOW I FOUGHT OUT THE INTERVAL
THEY WERE NEVER IMPORTUNATE AND YET NEVER LISTLESS
NO ATTEMPT NONETHELESS COULD WELL REQUIRE MORE TACT THAN JUST THIS ATTEMPT TO SUPPLY ONE'S SELF ALL THE NATURE
AH OF COURSE SHE'S A JOLLY PERFECT LADY
POOR WOMAN--SHE PAID FOR IT THEN YOU DO KNOW WHAT SHE DIED OF I ASKED
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I EVER UNDERSTAND WON'T YOU TELL DOUGLAS SOMEBODY ELSE INQUIRED
I DON'T DO IT I SOBBED IN DESPAIR
BUT HE'S LIKE NOBODY NOBODY SHE ECHOED
IT WAS AS IF WHAT I HAD YEARNED FOR HAD COME AT LAST ONLY TO ASTONISH ME
I MEAN THAT'S HIS WAY--THE MASTER'S I WAS STRUCK
AND WHAT DID THIS STRAIN OF TROUBLE MATTER WHEN MY EYES WENT BACK TO THE WINDOW ONLY TO SEE THAT THE AIR WAS CLEAR AGAIN AND--BY MY PERSONAL TRIUMPH--THE INFLUENCE QUENCHED
I MIGHT WELL HAVE NEEDED THAT FOR WITH THIS HARD BLOW OF THE PROOF THAT HER EYES WERE HOPELESSLY SEALED I FELT MY OWN SITUATION HORRIBLY CRUMBLE I FELT--I SAW--MY LIVID PREDECESSOR PRESS FROM HER POSITION ON MY DEFEAT AND I WAS CONSCIOUS MORE THAN ALL OF WHAT I SHOULD HAVE FROM THIS INSTANT TO DEAL WITH IN THE ASTOUNDING LITTLE ATTITUDE OF FLORA
I KNEW THE NEXT DAY THAT A LETTER CONTAINING THE KEY HAD BY THE FIRST POST GONE OFF TO HIS LONDON APARTMENTS
AND I REMEMBER HOW ON THIS OCCASION--FOR THE SLEEPING HOUSE AND THE CONCENTRATION ALIKE OF OUR DANGER AND OUR WATCH SEEMED TO HELP--I FELT THE IMPORTANCE OF GIVING THE LAST JERK TO THE CURTAIN
IT WAS QUINT'S OWN FANCY
SHE'LL NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN HIDEOUS AND OBSCURE AS IT ALL WAS IT HELD MRS GROSE BRIEFLY SILENT
SO THAT PRESENTLY TO PUT THE THING WITH SOME COHERENCE AND WITH THE MERE AID OF HER PRESENCE TO MY OWN MIND I WENT ON
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK AH WELL OF COURSE I DON'T
IT WAS THE WAY HE LIKED EVERYONE SHE HAD NO SOONER SPOKEN INDEED THAN SHE CAUGHT HERSELF UP
I WOULD HAVE THANKED HIM WITH ALL MY SOUL HAD I NOT HAD IN A PROPORTIONATE MEASURE THIS CONVICTION OF THE SECRET OF MY PUPILS
THEN BELIEVE IT I FELT FORTHWITH A NEW IMPATIENCE TO SEE HIM
BUT MILES WOULD REMEMBER--MILES WOULD KNOW AH DON'T TRY HIM BROKE FROM MRS GROSE
BUT THE NEXT DAY AS THE HOUR FOR MY DRIVE APPROACHED I CROPPED UP IN ANOTHER PLACE
I COULD TAKE THE AIR IN THE COURT AT LEAST AND THERE MRS GROSE COULD JOIN ME
THE SHOCK IN TRUTH HAD SUNK INTO ME STILL DEEPER THAN I KNEW ON THE NIGHT WHEN LOOKING OUT TO SEE EITHER QUINT OR MISS JESSEL UNDER THE STARS I HAD BEHELD THE BOY OVER WHOSE REST I WATCHED AND WHO HAD IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT IN WITH HIM--HAD STRAIGHTWAY THERE TURNED IT ON ME--THE LOVELY UPWARD LOOK WITH WHICH FROM THE BATTLEMENTS ABOVE ME THE HIDEOUS APPARITION OF QUINT HAD PLAYED
I CROSSED THE PASSAGE AND LISTENED A MINUTE AT MILES'S DOOR
SHE WAS A LADY I TURNED IT OVER
ON WHICH I MUST HAVE SHOWN HER--AS I WAS INDEED BUT TOO CONSCIOUS--A FRONT OF MISERABLE DEFEAT
WHAT SHE AND I HAD VIRTUALLY SAID TO EACH OTHER WAS THAT PRETEXTS WERE USELESS NOW
AND THIS STARTED US AFRESH SO THAT IN THE COURSE OF BUT FEW MINUTES MORE WE REACHED A POINT FROM WHICH WE FOUND THE BOAT TO BE WHERE I HAD SUPPOSED IT
WHY DID YOU PULL THE CURTAIN OVER THE PLACE TO MAKE ME THINK YOU WERE STILL THERE FLORA LUMINOUSLY CONSIDERED
IF ON EITHER OF THESE LAST NIGHTS YOU HAD BEEN WITH EITHER CHILD YOU WOULD CLEARLY HAVE UNDERSTOOD
WITH A DETERMINATION--INDESCRIBABLE
