THE LATTER HAD EVIDENTLY NEVER BEEN USED
PERHAPS I WAS WRONG SHE SAID HEAVILY
SHE WAS IN DEEP MOURNING AND I THINK WHEN SHE CAME SHE EXPECTED TO GO AT ONCE
I SEEN THERE WASN'T MUCH MORE TO DO ANYHOW AT THE FIRE--WE'D GOT THE FLAMES UNDER CONTROL"--GERTRUDE LOOKED AT ME AND SMILED--"SO I STARTED DOWN THE HILL
I DO REMEMBER EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO BE KILLED
ONCE IN THE NIGHT I WAKENED AND THOUGHT I HEARD THE TAPPING AGAIN
AND THEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT TO STAY
COME--OUT HE REPEATED
IT WAS AS CONVENIENT IN ITS APPOINTMENTS AS THE BIG HOUSE AND INFINITELY MORE COZY
HALSEY HAD BEEN GONE SINCE THE FRIDAY NIGHT BEFORE AND WITH THE PASSAGE OF EACH DAY I FELT THAT HIS CHANCES WERE LESSENING
THEY WERE HAVING A DISPUTE HE SAID
IT MOVED BUT NOTHING SEEMED TO HAPPEN AND THEN I DISCOVERED THE TROUBLE
PERHAPS THE DIVERSION WAS GOOD FOR ME
THE PURSUIT WAS TAKEN UP THEN BY ALL EXCEPT ALEX WHO WAS DETERMINED TO LIBERATE ME
THE STABLE WAS OFF THE WEST WING
IT WAS IN NO SENSE OF THE WORD A SECRET CHAMBER AND IT WAS EVIDENT IT HAD NOT BEEN DISTURBED SINCE THE HOUSE WAS BUILT
THEN I HEARD HALSEY ANSWER IT AND IN A FEW MINUTES HE CAME UP-STAIRS AND KNOCKED AT MY DOOR
HE WAS GETTING BETTER OF TYPHOID SHE SAID AND HE'S PICKING UP FINE WILL YOU TELL ME HIS MOTHER'S NAME AND ADDRESS THAT'S THE TROUBLE THE YOUNG WOMAN SAID KNITTING HER BROWS
THAT NIGHT LOUISE ARRIVED UNEXPECTEDLY
THE MISSING BONDS HAD BEEN ADVERTISED AND SOME OF THEM DISCOVERED
HALSEY I SAID WHEN HE SAUNTERED IN IS THERE A POLICEMAN IN CASANOVA CONSTABLE HE SAID LACONICALLY
I AM AFRAID SHE IS WORSE TO-NIGHT SHE VENTURED AT LAST
WE HAD TURNED AWAY AT LEAST A DOZEN REPORTERS
SHE TALKED TO HIM FOR A LONG TIME BUT WHEN I ASKED HIM AFTERWARD HE DIDN'T KNOW HER NAME A YOUNG WOMAN NOT VERY YOUNG
I HOPE TO MARRY HER SOME DAY
ALTOGETHER WE WERE A SAD-LOOKING TRIO THAT GATHERED AROUND A BREAKFAST THAT NO ONE COULD EAT
ONE SET MONOGRAM CUFF-LINKS HE READ ONE SET PLAIN PEARL LINKS ONE SET CUFF-LINKS WOMAN'S HEAD SET WITH DIAMONDS AND EMERALDS
GERTRUDE'S RIGHT ANKLE WAS THE ONE SHE HAD SPRAINED
IS THAT YOUR BUSINESS OR MINE LIDDY WAS AGGRIEVED
AS I WAITED AT THE PORTE-COCHERE I SAW THE UNDER-GARDENER AN INOFFENSIVE GRAYISH-HAIRED MAN TRIMMING BORDERS NEAR THE HOUSE
BUT JUST NOW MRS WATSON'S FACE WAS AN ENIGMA
WHAT POSSIBLE CONNECTION COULD THERE BE BETWEEN HALSEY AND GERTRUDE AND THE MURDER OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG
BEING QUITE CONFIDENT THAT THE GAP WAS OF UNHOLY ORIGIN SHE DID NOT CONCERN HERSELF WITH SUCH TRIFLES AS A BIT OF MORTAR AND LATH
YES'M SHE SAID AT LAST
I LEANED OVER THE STAIR-RAIL AND FIRED AGAIN
GERTRUDE I SAID I HAVE BEEN A VERY SELFISH OLD WOMAN
I WISH THEY WERE BOTH HERE HE SAID WHEN I FINISHED
THEN SHE WENT TO THE DOOR ON TO THE VERANDA AND THREW IT OPEN
THERE WAS REVEALED HOWEVER ON INSPECTION ONLY THE BRICK OF THE CHIMNEY ON ONE SIDE AND THE OUTER WALL OF THE HOUSE ON THE OTHER
THE FIRST NIGHT PASSED QUIETLY ENOUGH
SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM BLOOD-POISONING
I KNOW YOU ARE AS IGNORANT AS I AM
CARRINGTON
NOT ESPECIALLY
NO MISS ARMSTRONG HE SAID
I WAS CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN
I ROUSED LIDDY TO GET THEM SOMETHING TO EAT--THOMAS WAS BEYOND REACH IN THE LODGE--AND PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER EVIDENT TERROR OF THE KITCHEN REGIONS
THERE WAS MUCH TO BE CLEARED UP BEFORE I WOULD CONSENT TO ANY RENEWAL OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH JOHN BAILEY
I OVERHEARD A PART OF A CONVERSATION YESTERDAY THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
I--THINK--YOU--DID IT--YOURSELF THEY STARED AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE BIG LIBRARY TABLE WITH YOUNG EYES ALL AT ONCE HARD SUSPICIOUS
AT TEN O'CLOCK THE HOUSEHOLD HAD SETTLED DOWN FOR THE NIGHT
ITS CHEERFUL APPEARANCE GAVE NO INDICATION WHATEVER OF ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY
THERE YOU GO HE EXCLAIMED
AND THERE WERE OTHER THINGS TOO
ONE WAS UNLOCKED AND OFFERED AN EASY ESCAPE
MISS INNES MR JAMIESON WAS SAYING IN THE LAST THREE DAYS HAVE YOU SEEN A--ANY SUSPICIOUS FIGURES AROUND THE GROUNDS
THE CAR STRUCK THE TRAIN AND THEY HAD ONLY TO DISPOSE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE IN THE ROAD
I WAITED FOR HIM TO CALL OUT AGAIN BUT HE DID NOT SO I WENT DOWN-STAIRS
ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME SCENE AS BEFORE GREETED MY EYES AT THE COTTAGE
MY MIND WAS NOT ON MY ERRAND THERE NOW
JUST NOW WITH SO MUCH AT STAKE IT--IS SHAMEFUL
HOW LONG HAS LUCIEN BEEN HERE MR JAMIESON ASKED
THEY COULD SEE THE LIGHTS AND THEY THOUGHT SOMEONE HAD BEEN INJURED
THE TRUNK-ROOM JUST OVER MY HEAD HAD AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND A BRICK CHIMNEY AND YET THERE WAS NOTHING OF THE KIND IN MY ROOM
AS QUIETLY AS CALMLY AS I COULD I WENT OVER THE WHOLE STORY FROM THE NIGHT LIDDY AND I HAD BEEN ALONE UP TO THE STRANGE EXPERIENCE OF ROSIE AND HER PURSUER
WE DID NOT TALK
FOR THREE MONTHS EVERYTHING WENT FAIRLY WELL
ONE MORE NIGHT LIKE THE LAST TWO WILL END ME
GOOD NIGHT AS THOMAS SHUFFLED OUT MR JAMIESON WATCHED ME SHARPLY
PERSONALLY I KNEW NOTHING OF EITHER MOVE
JOHN BAILEY APPEARS IV WHERE IS HALSEY
WELL I SAID WHEN THE SILENCE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS SEEM TO BE WARMING UP SILENCE FROM LIDDY AND A LONG SIGH
BUT I KNOW WHO DID IT ALL RIGHT
IF WE COULD FIND THAT WOMAN WE WOULD HAVE THE WHOLE THING MR JAMIESON DID YOU EVER THINK THAT PAUL ARMSTRONG MIGHT NOT HAVE DIED A NATURAL DEATH THAT IS THE THING WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO FIND OUT HE REPLIED
MR JAMIESON WANTS YOU TO HELP HIM BREAK THE LOCK
IF MR JAMIESON HAD BEEN THERE I SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING BUT I COULD NOT GO TO THESE STRANGE MEN AND TELL THEM MY NIECE HAD BEEN MISSING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
OUR LEAVE-TAKING WAS BRIEF
AND IN THE HOUSE ALEX AND HALSEY SEARCHED EVERY CORNER OF THE LOWER FLOOR FINDING NO ONE
SHE WAS SLEEPING LIKE A TIRED CHILD
SOME TIME PERHAPS I CAN TELL YOU
THERE IS SOMEBODY IN THERE LORD HAVE MERCY GASPED LIDDY AND TURNED TO RUN
RIDICULOUS THINGS LIDDY HAD SAID ABOUT A GHOST--I AM NOT AT ALL SUPERSTITIOUS EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH EVERYTHING DARK--THINGS LIKE THAT CAME BACK TO ME
THEN WHERE SHALL I BE YOU FORGET I BROKE IN THAT I HAVE THE REVOLVER AND THAT NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT IT BUT GERTRUDE HAD RISEN ANGRILY
MOREOVER SHE IS UNABLE TO SEE ANY ONE
I WAS ACROSS THE ROOM AND I HAD GOT THE CHAIR
YOU ARE NOT TO THINK OF ANYTHING BUT OF GETTING WELL I SAID PATTING HER HAND
SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG WITH THE CAR AND NO WONDER--THE WAY HALSEY WENT DOWN THE HILL IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE THE CREAKING VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP AT THE DOOR
OF THE THREE I THINK THOMAS WAS THE ONLY ONE SINCERELY MOURNED
I WISH YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT BEFORE HE SAID AS HE PUT THE MEMORANDUM CAREFULLY AWAY
GERTRUDE WAS TIRED WITH THE TRIP AND WENT UP TO BED VERY SOON
IT WAS QUITE DARK BUT SHE COULD SEE HIS WHITE SHIRT-BOSOM
I WENT INTO THE LIVING-ROOM WHERE MISS LIDDY SAID HE WAS AND HALF-WAY ACROSS TO THE LIBRARY I HEARD HIM TALKING TO SOME ONE
IT CAME TO A STOP IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THERE WERE HURRIED STEPS ON THE VERANDA
THEN I THOUGHT PERHAPS ARNOLD HAD USED HIS KEY
MONDAY NIGHT HAD BEEN UNEVENTFUL
THAT ONE IS MERELY CURIOUS
HOW LONG ARE YOU AND I GOING TO PLAY OUR LITTLE COMEDY MR
HERE IS SOME MONEY FOR THE TELEPHONE CALL
HALSEY I CARE--YOU KNOW THAT--BUT--NOT ENOUGH TO MARRY YOU THAT IS NOT TRUE LOUISE HE SAID STERNLY
MADE OF WOOD AND CARVED THE MORE I LOOKED THE MORE I WONDERED THAT I HAD NOT NOTICED BEFORE THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH A MANTEL IN SUCH A PLACE
HALSEY HAD GONE TO SUPERVISE THE FITTING OF THE CAR WITH BLANKETS AND PILLOWS AND GERTRUDE WAS OPENING AND AIRING LOUISE'S OWN ROOMS AT THE HOUSE
IT WAS A MAN IN A LONG COAT WHAT WOMAN WAS A MAN I DISCOURAGED HER WITHOUT LOOKING UP AND SHE WENT BACK TO THE COUCH
AS IT HAPPENED IT WAS MR JAMIESON WHO BROKE UP THE TABLEAU
IT WAS IMPROBABLE THAT SUCH A WOUND HAD BEEN SELF-INFLICTED AND ITS OBLIQUE DOWNWARD COURSE POINTED TO THE FACT THAT THE SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED FROM ABOVE
HALSEY STOPPED AND EXAMINED THE LODGE WITH CALCULATING EYES
I HEARD HIM STRIKE THE WALL
THE BANK HAD NOT OPENED FOR BUSINESS ON TUESDAY
IN THE SECOND PLACE I FOUND ON THE EDGE OF THE BILLIARD-TABLE A CHARRED CIGAR WHICH HAD BURNED ITSELF PARTLY OUT AND A CIGARETTE WHICH HAD CONSUMED ITSELF TO THE CORK TIP
ON THE FIFTH STEP BELOW WAS A ROUND DENT IN THE HARD WOOD
IT WAS LATE WHEN I GOT UP
I WAS ROUSED BY HEARING MR JAMIESON COMING RAPIDLY BACK THROUGH THE DRAWING-ROOM
AND THEN THE MOTHER OF LUCIEN WALLACE WOULD OBTRUDE HERSELF AND AN ALMOST EQUALLY GOOD CASE MIGHT BE MADE AGAINST HER
WE ARE MAKING A LOT OF TROUBLE OUT OF SOMETHING PERHAPS VERY SMALL
DOWN IN THE CREEK BOTTOM I ALMOST RUN INTO A MAN
EVERYTHING WAS SECURE AND LIDDY A LITTLE LESS NERVOUS NOW HAD JUST POINTED OUT TO ME THE DISGRACEFULLY DUSTY CONDITION OF THE HARD-WOOD FLOOR WHEN SUDDENLY THE LIGHTS WENT OUT
WHAT WAS IT HE HAD SAID TO LOUISE THAT HAD SENT HER UP TO SUNNYSIDE HALF WILD WITH FEAR FOR HIM
HE WAS ON HIS GUARD AGAIN IN A MOMENT
INSEPARABLE AS THE WORDS SPECULATION AND PECULATION HAVE GROWN TO BE JOHN BAILEY WAS NOT KNOWN TO BE IN THE STOCK MARKET
SHE MAY BE AWAKE AND ALARMED SO IN SPITE OF HER PROTESTS I LEFT LIDDY ALONE AND WENT BACK TO THE EAST WING
I REMEMBER WONDERING WHY
IT WAS ANNA WHITCOMB IN TOWN AND SHE KEPT ME FOR TWENTY MINUTES TELLING ME THE CHILDREN HAD HAD THE MEASLES AND HOW MADAME SWEENY HAD BOTCHED HER NEW GOWN
I COME ACROSS THE VALLEY ALONG THE PATH FROM THE CLUB-HOUSE AND I GOES HOME THAT WAY
BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING ALL DAY THAT I'D BETTER TELL YOU
I DO NOT KNOW THE FAMILY HE SAID PREPARING TO GET INTO HIS TOP BUGGY
AND AT THAT I CAME TO MY SENSES AND PUT HIM OUT
THERE IS A HOLE IN THE TRUNK-ROOM WALL DUG OUT SINCE LAST NIGHT
SHE STOOD SMOOTHING THE FOLDS OF HER DEAD BLACK DRESS HER FACE AS WHITE AS CHALK ABOVE IT
THOMAS ALWAYS HAD A BAD HEART HEART DISEASE AND FRIGHT I SAID STILL ON THE EDGE OF MY CHAIR
NOW RIGGS WE ARE READY I'D NEVER HAVE COME TO YOU MR JAMIESON HE BEGAN IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR MISS ARMSTRONG
THE TRADERS HAD BEEN A FAVORITE BANK FOR SMALL TRADESPEOPLE AND IN ITS SAVINGS DEPARTMENT IT HAD SOLICITED THE SMALLEST DEPOSITS
NO MISS
HIS EVIDENCE WAS TOLD BRIEFLY AND AMOUNTED TO THIS
THE CARS BY THIS TIME THREE DAYS MIGHT BE SCATTERED OVER THE UNION
THAT WAS MY RECONSTRUCTED THEORY OF THAT AFTERNOON AND EVENING
OUR LITTLE CIRCLE INTACT UNTIL NOW WAS BROKEN
WHAT IS IT SHE CRIED
BUT YOUNG PEOPLE REFUSE TO PROFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THEIR ELDERS AND SOMETIMES THE ELDERS ARE THE ONES TO SUFFER
TELL WARNER HE IS NEEDED IN A HURRY I REPEATED AND TURNED INTO THE LITTLE SITTING-ROOM
YOU ARE TO SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY BEFORE THIS LADY YOU PROMISED YOU'D KEEP IT QUIET MR JAMIESON RIGGS PLAINLY DID NOT TRUST ME
BY LUNCHEON NOTHING HAD BEEN FOUND AND I WAS FRANTIC
THE DOCTOR WAS IN
THEN SOMETHING MADE A DIFFERENCE
HALSEY WAS GRADUALLY WAKING
OFF THE BILLIARD-ROOM IN THE EXTREME RIGHT WING WAS A DEN OR CARD-ROOM WITH A SMALL HALL OPENING ON THE EAST VERANDA AND FROM THERE WENT UP A NARROW CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
AND WHY HAD THE THIEF IF HE WERE A THIEF PICKED UP THE BROKEN CHINA OUT OF THE ROAD AND LEFT IT WITH HIS BOOTY
ABOUT HIS RELATIVES I HAVE ALREADY NOTIFIED HIS BROTHER IN THE VILLAGE
GO ON WHEN I CAME TO MISS INNES SURE AS I'M SITTIN HERE I THOUGHT I'D DIE
WHY DID ARNOLD ARMSTRONG COME BACK AFTER HE HAD LEFT THE HOUSE THE NIGHT HE WAS KILLED
HE LOOKED ALARMED AND APPREHENSIVE AND SUDDENLY I REMEMBERED THE SEALSKIN DRESSING-BAG IN THE LODGE
HAVE YOU EMPLOYED HIM LONG ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS IS HE EFFICIENT
I KNEW OF MR ARMSTRONG ONLY THROUGH HIS CONNECTION WITH THE BANK WHERE THE CHILDREN'S MONEY WAS LARGELY INVESTED AND THROUGH AN UGLY STORY ABOUT THE SON ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WHO WAS REPORTED TO HAVE FORGED HIS FATHER'S NAME FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT TO SOME BANK PAPER
HE HAS LEFT DOCTOR WALKER AND HE HAS SOMETHING HE WANTS TO TELL US RIGGS CAME INTO THE ROOM DIFFIDENTLY BUT MR JAMIESON PUT HIM AT HIS EASE
I WAS NOT ACTIVELY ANTAGONISTIC TO GERTRUDE'S LOVER BUT I MEANT TO BE CONVINCED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
WHEN YOU AND HALSEY ARE MARRIED YOU CAN BE AS HONEST AS YOU LIKE AND YOU WILL CERTAINLY BE POOR HALSEY CAME TO THE DOOR AT THAT MOMENT AND I COULD HEAR HIM COAXING LIDDY FOR ADMISSION TO THE SICK ROOM
I RESOLVED TO MAKE INQUIRY WHEN I GOT HOME AND IN THE MEANTIME MY PRESENT ERRAND ABSORBED ME
HE IS LIVING WELL I SAID IF SHE KNOWS THAT SHE KNOWS MORE
I DECIDED TO MAKE CERTAIN HOWEVER BY GOING TO THE BRIDGE THAT NIGHT
AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS HALSEY GAVE AN EXCLAMATION AND PUT DOWN THE LIGHT
I HAD NOT SEEN MR JAMIESON SINCE MORNING BUT I KNEW HE HAD BEEN INTERROGATING THE SERVANTS
CHAPTER XXIV FLINDERS IF HALSEY HAD ONLY TAKEN ME FULLY INTO HIS CONFIDENCE THROUGH THE WHOLE AFFAIR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH SIMPLER
WHEN WARNER MARRIED ROSIE LIDDY SNIFFED AND SAID WHAT I TOOK FOR FAITHFULNESS IN ROSIE HAD BEEN NOTHING BUT MAWKISHNESS
CHAPTER VI IN THE EAST CORRIDOR WHEN THE DETECTIVE LEFT HE ENJOINED ABSOLUTE SECRECY ON EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSEHOLD
WE WISH TO MAKE AS LITTLE OF IT AS POSSIBLE THERE WAS ONE OTHER POSSIBILITY AND WE TRIED THAT
SHE REFUSED A DOCTOR AND SHRANK MORBIDLY FROM HAVING HER PRESENCE KNOWN
AFTER YOU--AND JACK HAD GONE WHAT IF THAT RUFFIAN CAME BACK AND SHE--AND SHE I COULDN'T FINISH
I'M NOT GOING TO BED SHE SAID
HE DREW IN HIS BREATH THE SHARP INTAKING OF HORROR THAT FILLS LUNGS SUDDENLY COLLAPSED
I DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT HOW LONG DID HE STAY ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
WHY IT IS THE TYPICAL MYSTERIOUS LADY
SUDDENLY FROM THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE ABOVE US CAME THE SOUND OF A CAUTIOUS FOOTSTEP
BUT IT SOUNDS VERY MUCH AS THOUGH SOME ONE IS TRYING TO BREAK INTO THE HOUSE LIDDY WAS SHIVERING VIOLENTLY
ON THE NIGHT BEFORE ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS MURDERED JACK BAILEY HAD MADE HIS FIRST ATTEMPT TO SEARCH FOR THE SECRET ROOM
WE FOUND IT THERE LAST NIGHT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THROWN UNDER THE TRAIN BY THE FORCE OF THE SHOCK I SAID TREMULOUSLY
IT WAS ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK WHEN LIDDY LEFT ME FOR A NAP BEFORE DINNER HAVING PUT ME INTO A GRAY SILK DRESSING-GOWN AND A PAIR OF SLIPPERS
GERTRUDE WENT TO CHURCH AND HALSEY TOOK A LONG WALK IN THE MORNING
THE DETECTIVE SAT IN ABSOLUTE DARKNESS ON THE LOWER STEP OF THE STAIRS DOZING HE SAID AFTERWARDS NOW AND THEN
SHE TOLD HIM THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG AND THAT THE BANK WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE
IT DEVELOPED NOTHING NEW BEYOND THE STORY OF DOCTOR STEWART'S AND THAT WAS VOLUNTEERED AN INQUEST IS ONLY A NECESSARY FORMALITY MISS INNES HE REPLIED
I'VE SEEN IT LIDDY WAILED
HE'S ACTING QUEER WARNER EXPLAINED
VERY WELL
THAT AFTERNOON THE ARMSTRONGS HOUSEKEEPER A YOUNGISH GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN APPLIED FOR MRS RALSTON'S PLACE AND I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO TAKE HER
I HAD TAKEN THE MOST INTENSE DISLIKE TO THIS DOCTOR WALKER WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN AND WHO WAS BEING TALKED OF IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AS THE FIANCE OF LOUISE ARMSTRONG
GERTRUDE HAD COME ON HEARING THE NOISE AND NOW WE STOOD STARING AT EACH OTHER OVER--OF ALL THINGS ON EARTH--A WHITE SILK AND WOOL BLANKET EXQUISITELY FINE
WEDNESDAY NIGHT NINE O'CLOCK
OF COURSE IT WAS GERTRUDE
ONE NEVER KNOWS WHY CERTAIN MEN CLING TO A MESSY UPPER LIP THAT MUST GET INTO THINGS ANY MORE THAN ONE UNDERSTANDS SOME WOMEN BUILDING UP THEIR HAIR ON WIRE ATROCITIES
HERE HE FOUND SOME THINGS THAT INTERESTED HIM
LIKE HALSEY'S IT HAD NOT BEEN OCCUPIED
WE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE AND GERTRUDE WHO WAS MORE LIKE HERSELF SINCE HER TALK WITH HALSEY SAT DOWN AT THE MAHOGANY DESK IN THE LIVING-ROOM TO WRITE A LETTER
LIDDY HEARD MY APPROACH AND CAME OUT TO MEET ME
SHE FOLDED HER LIPS A LITTLE TIGHTER
MR JAMIESON GOT ALL KINDS OF CREDIT AND SOME OF IT HE DESERVED BUT IF JACK BAILEY AS ALEX HAD NOT TRACED HALSEY AND INSISTED ON THE DISINTERRING OF PAUL ARMSTRONG'S CASKET IF HE HAD NOT SUSPECTED THE TRUTH FROM THE START WHERE WOULD THE DETECTIVE HAVE BEEN
YOU ARE SURE THE HOLE WAS NOT HERE YESTERDAY I ASKED LIDDY WHOSE EXPRESSION WAS A MIXTURE OF SATISFACTION AND ALARM
AND THEN--THE MADNESS SEIZED ME
THERE'S ONLY TROUBLE COMES OF HUNTING GHOSTS
HER HEAD WAS ON HIS SHOULDER HIS FACE AGAINST HER HAIR
THE GARDENER MENTIONED BY HALSEY CAME OUT ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND WALKED UP FROM THE STATION
IF ANY SUCH CASE COMES TO YOU WILL IT BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE FOR YOU TO LET ME KNOW I SHALL BE ONLY TOO HAPPY HE SAID
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MISS INNES I WAS CRYING GERTRUDE SAID IN A LOW TONE
THAT THE UNKNOWN HAD GOT UP-STAIRS WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
A WOMAN IN WHITE DOWN THE HALL I PAID NO ATTENTION
YOUR SKIN'S YOUR OWN
A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE HANDIER AT BURYING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING THEM UP THE UNCANNY MOMENT CAME WHEN ALEX AND JAMIESON TOSSED THE SPADES ON THE GRASS AND I CONFESS I HID MY FACE
IF YOU MUST SMOKE YOU MUST
GERTRUDE WENT INTO TOWN WITH HER AND SAW HER SAFELY HOME
BUT I AM A LARGE WOMAN AND LIDDY IS SMALL
I AM SURE I DID NOT FAINT
GERTRUDE WHEN YOU BROUGHT DOWN A REVOLVER THAT NIGHT FOR JACK TO TAKE WITH HIM WHAT ONE DID YOU BRING
WHAT DID HE BRING A TELEGRAM--FOR BAILEY HE SAID
ONCE OR TWICE I HEARD MICE IN THE PARTITIONS AND SO I SAT ON THE TABLE WITH MY FEET ON THE CHAIR
IT WAS MR JAMIESON
THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY QUIET DOWN THERE
BUT THE FACE THAT SHOWED IN THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN WAS A FACE I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
I SAT DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE BED AND WAITED IN SEVERE SILENCE FOR HIM TO STOP BUT HE ONLY SEEMED TO GROW WORSE
WHO WOULD IT BE THAT MR JAMIESON HAD TRAPPED IN THE CELLAR
LOUISE WAS ABLE TO SIT UP AND SHE ALLOWED HALSEY AND LIDDY TO ASSIST HER DOWN-STAIRS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
AND THE PRESENT INNES ADMITS HIMSELF HE ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR--FOR LOUISE EXACTLY I SAID DESPAIRINGLY AND OF COURSE YOU ARE TAKEN AT YOUR OWN VALUATION
I AM SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I HAVE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MR JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
GRADUALLY I ROUSED TO MY SURROUNDINGS AND TO THE FACT THAT IN SPITE OF THE VENTILATORS THE AIR WAS BAD AND GROWING WORSE
DID HE ASK FOR HALSEY YES
BUT SHE DID NOT REPLY AND HER EYES SHOWED NO RECOGNITION
WELL I SAID LOOKING UP
IT WAS PURE ELIZABETHAN
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THREE WHEN I HEARD SOME ONE RAPPING
I STOPPED HER BY GIVING HER A GOOD SHAKE
BEHOLD SAYS THE DOCTOR THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME WHY WAS MR BAILEY NOT PRESENT AT THE INQUEST THE DETECTIVE'S EXPRESSION WAS PECULIAR
WHO WAS THE MAN ON THE DRIVE NEAR THE LODGE AND WHOSE GOLD-MOUNTED DRESSING-BAG HAD I SEEN IN THE LODGE SITTING-ROOM
WAS FANNY ARMSTRONG WITHOUT A CHANCE OF DOUBT
I MISSED THE SUMMERS WITH THEM WHEN SOMEWHAT LATER AT BOARDING-SCHOOL AND COLLEGE THE CHILDREN SPENT MUCH OF THEIR VACATIONS WITH FRIENDS
AS YOU KNOW MY NEPHEW HAS NOT YET BEEN FOUND SO I UNDERSTAND STIFFLY
BUT HERE AGAIN I WAS DRIVEN BACK
HE LEFT THE BANK APPARENTLY SATISFIED AND WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES HE HAD CALLED UP THREE DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE TRADERS BOARD OF DIRECTORS
WELL THE CARRINGTON WOMAN DIDN'T SHOW UP UNTIL THE NIGHT MR HALSEY DISAPPEARED
WHEN THE FRENCH CLOCK IN THE DRAWING-ROOM STRUCK THREE I GOT UP AND THEN--I HEARD A STEP ON THE EAST PORCH JUST OUTSIDE THE CARD-ROOM
THAT DAY I REPEATED TO LOUISE THE TELEGRAM MR WARTON HAD OPENED
HE SENT GERTRUDE DOWN TO THE LODGE LOADED WITH ALL MANNER OF IMPOSSIBLE THINGS INCLUDING AN ARMFUL OF TURKISH TOWELS AND A BOX OF MUSTARD PLASTERS AND AS THE TWO GIRLS HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER SOMEWHAT BEFORE LOUISE BRIGHTENED PERCEPTIBLY WHEN SHE SAW HER
BUT THOUGH I MIGHT JEER AT ROSIE AS MUCH AS I WISHED THE FACT REMAINED THAT SOME ONE HAD BEEN ON THE DRIVE THAT NIGHT WHO HAD NO BUSINESS THERE
HE WAS RATHER PALE BUT VERY COMPOSED
AS THE LODGE WAS FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE HOUSE IT SEEMED TO ME THAT EITHER FIRE OR THIEVES COULD COMPLETE THEIR WORK OF DESTRUCTION UNDISTURBED
I LIVED WITH DOCTOR WALKER SEVEN YEARS AND I KNOW HIM WELL
SHE WAS AS MUCH IN THE DARK AS WE WERE
AND YET EVERY WAY I TURNED I SEEMED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT POINTED TO SUCH A CONNECTION
I AM PERFECTLY COOL I SAID AND I AM GOING TO REMAIN HERE THE LIGHTS FLASHED UP ALONG THAT END OF THE CORRIDOR THROWING THE DOORS INTO RELIEF
WARNER CAN TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE NOON TRAIN LIDDY'S FACE WAS REALLY FUNNY
SOME ONE HAS BEEN KILLED KILLED THIEVES I SAID SHORTLY
THERE'S A FAST FREIGHT GOES THROUGH AT FOUR FORTY-FIVE AND I HAD TO GET DOWN TO THE STATION
ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO COME THREE TAPS AND A PAUSE FROM THE FLOOR UNDER US
THOMAS I SAID WHEN HE WAS SHEEPISHLY MOPPING THE FLOOR SMOKING IS A FILTHY AND INJURIOUS HABIT
IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF WE HOLD THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION NOW
I'LL CATCH THE HACK DOWN THE ROAD AND HOLD IT HE SAID
SHE'S WILLING TO TAKE ME WAR GOVERNOR OR NO PROVIDED HER MOTHER CONSENTS
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO GO ON BUT THIS
HOW IS YOUR PATIENT HE ASKED WITH HIS ODD LITTLE SMILE
SINCE A WEEK AGO LAST FRIDAY
SHE WAS TOO ILL TO ARGUE WITH AND BESIDES SICK PEOPLE TAKE QUEER FANCIES
VERY WELL SIR AND I HOPE IT WILL BE SOON
BUT ALL WAS QUIET AND I HAD REACHED THE STAGE WHERE I REFUSED TO BE DISTURBED FOR MINOR OCCURRENCES
THE LIST WAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
THE TESTIMONY IS INVALUABLE ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT YOUR BROTHER AND MR ARMSTRONG HAD I BELIEVE QUARRELED RATHER SERIOUSLY SOME TIME AGO NONSENSE I BROKE IN
I FELL ASLEEP SOON AND WAS DREAMING THAT DOCTOR WALKER WAS BUILDING HIS NEW HOUSE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF MY WINDOWS
MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE I STUMBLED INTO LOUISE'S BEDROOM
HE SAW LIDDY THERE AND DIVINED AT ONCE THAT LOUISE WAS ALONE
IT WAS A REVOLVER MR JAMIESON I ADMITTED CORNERED AT LAST BUT I CAN NOT SHOW IT TO YOU
NOT ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY MR JARVIS ASKED WHEN HE HAD GOT HIS BREATH
THOMAS AND SHE HAD GOT LOUISE QUIET AND A LITTLE BEFORE THREE MRS WATSON STARTED UP TO THE HOUSE
I KNEW SHE WOULD
IF I CAN DO ANYTHING I WILL
A MAN OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE PLAN OF HIS HOUSE WITHOUT BECOMING AN OBJECT OF SUSPICION THERE IS LITTLE IN THE PAPER ITSELF HE ADMITTED
I STOOD GAZING DOWN AT HER IN A STUPOR OF AMAZEMENT
IF THE MOTHER COMES SHE IS TO KNOW NOTHING OF THIS VISIT--ABSOLUTELY NOT A WORD AND IN RETURN FOR YOUR SILENCE YOU MAY USE THIS MONEY FOR--SOMETHING FOR YOUR OWN CHILDREN HER TIRED FADED FACE LIGHTED UP AND I SAW HER GLANCE AT THE LITTLE TATES SMALL FEET
WHO WAS IT SCARED MISS LOUISE ALMOST INTO HER GRAVE I'M DOING MY BEST TO FIND OUT I SAID
HALSEY WHO HAD NEVER TAKEN SERIOUSLY MY ACCOUNT OF THE NIGHT LIDDY AND I WERE THERE ALONE WAS GRAVE ENOUGH NOW
WHAT ELSE HE DID I DON'T KNOW--BUT HE DISMISSED ME AND PRETTY NEARLY THROTTLED ME--FOR TELLING MR JAMIESON HERE ABOUT MR INNES HAVING BEEN AT HIS OFFICE THE NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED AND ABOUT MY HEARING THEM QUARRELING WHAT WAS IT WARNER OVERHEARD THE WOMAN SAY TO MR INNES IN THE LIBRARY THE DETECTIVE ASKED ME
MY WIFE WAS SAYIN THE OTHER DAY DAVE YOU MIGHT AS WELL A SAVED THE MONEY IN THAT THERE HELMET AND SHIRT AND HERE LAST NIGHT THEY CAME IN HANDY
HE HAD THROWN OF THE AIR OF FRIENDLINESS AND I THOUGHT TOO THAT HE LOOKED ANXIOUS AND HAGGARD
AND YET ONE OF THE MOST INEXPLICABLE OCCURRENCES OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR TOOK PLACE THAT VERY NIGHT
YOU ARE A CLEVER WOMAN MISS INNES
MY MIND SEEMED ABLE TO HOLD ONLY ONE THOUGHT
CONFOUND SUCH CARELESS WORK
I TOOK NO ONE ON FAITH
IN THE MEANTIME I TAKE NO ONE ON FAITH
AND IF YOU HAD COME THROUGH WHAT I HAVE YOU WOULD BE A BUNDLE OF NERVES TOO
IT SEEMED AT FIRST TO BE A CLOSET EMPTY
AT THAT MOMENT SAM'S DEEP VOICE BOOMED FROM SOMEWHERE JUST BELOW
THERE IS NO SIGN OF INJURY HE SAID AND I KNOW I FOR ONE DREW A LONG BREATH OF RELIEF
THE BODY OF PAUL ARMSTRONG WOULD ARRIVE SUNDAY AND WOULD BE BURIED FROM THE ARMSTRONG TOWN HOUSE
HE WAS WATCHING ALEX
I AM AFRAID--TO HAVE YOU STAY THAT WAS ALL
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE STATION GERTRUDE
SHORTLY BEFORE SIX HE GOT UP AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND IN A FEW MINUTES HE CAME OUT AND CALLED ME TO THE TELEPHONE
WE HAD OCCASION WITHIN A DAY OR TWO TO BE DOUBLY THANKFUL THAT WE HAD GIVEN HIM HIS FREEDOM
I WONDERED IF HE EVER PRESCRIBED ANYTHING SO PLEBEIAN--AND SO DELICIOUS
THERE HAD BEEN NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO BREAK INTO THE HOUSE
WITH OLD PETER ARMSTRONG DRIVING A STAGE ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS WHILE YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS WAR GOVERNOR WELL OF COURSE THE WAR GOVERNOR'S DEAD AND OUT OF THE MATRIMONIAL MARKET HALSEY INTERRUPTED
SHE ASKED ME IF HE HAD BEEN HEARD FROM OR IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEARNED
IT IS THE STORY OF A LOVING AND INGENIOUS WOMAN AND--THIS THING TO-NIGHT MAY UPSET MY WHOLE VIEW OF THE CASE
JUST AS THE ONLY GOOD INDIAN IS A DEAD INDIAN SO THE ONLY SAFE DEFAULTER IS A DEAD DEFAULTER
DOWN AND OUT WITH ALL OF THEM BUT THE WHOLE THING IS ABSURD I ARGUED
THAT WHOLE END OF THE CELLAR IS KEPT LOCKED SO NOBODY CAN GET AT THE CLOTHES AND THEN THE KEY'S LEFT IN THE DOOR
GERTRUDE THREW A SHAWL AROUND MY SHOULDERS AND WE ALL STARTED DOWN OVER THE HILL
WHO HAD MADE THE HOLE IN THE TRUNK-ROOM WALL
WHERE HAD HALSEY GONE
AND HER FACE AS WHITE AS A PILLOW-SLIP WHEN SHE TUMBLED DOWN THE STAIRS NO DOUBT THERE IS SOME NATURAL EXPLANATION FOR IT ELIZA I SAID
I SHALL BELIEVE MR BAILEY INNOCENT THE MOMENT HE IS SHOWN TO BE
MISS RACHEL
I ASKED MR BAILEY TO LEAVE THE CLUB WITH ME AND COME TO SUNNYSIDE OVER SUNDAY ISN'T IT A FACT MR INNES THAT YOU TOOK MR BAILEY AWAY FROM THE CLUB-HOUSE BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID THERE WOULD BE BLOWS THE SITUATION WAS UNPLEASANT HALSEY SAID EVASIVELY
THE ADDITIONS TO MY EDUCATION MADE ME A PROPERLY EQUIPPED MAIDEN AUNT AND BY SPRING I WAS QUITE TRACTABLE
OH MISS RACHEL NOT OUT IN THE HALL TRYING TO HOLD ME BACK
HALSEY ALWAYS RECKLESS HAD GONE AT ONCE TO DOCTOR WALKER AND DENOUNCED HIM
MISS INNES I CAN NOT MARRY HIM AND I AM AFRAID TO TELL HIM
THE DOCTOR HELPED ME INTO HIS CAPACIOUS BUGGY IN SILENCE
MR JAMIESON CAME BACK ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING
AS I LEANED OVER I FANCIED I HEARD A GROAN--OR WAS IT THE WIND
A MOMENT LATER LOUISE HAD BURST INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD THERE BAREHEADED AND BREATHING HARD
AND THEN I STEPPED BACK AGAIN INTO THE SHADOWS
LOOK AT THE BACK OF THE SHEET I TURNED OVER SOME OF THE SCRAPS AND SURE ENOUGH IT WAS A BLANK DEPOSIT SLIP FROM THE TRADERS BANK
THE WOMAN NINA CARRINGTON WAS THE COG THAT SLIPPED
BROADHURST OF THE MARINE BANK HAD PRODUCED TWO HUNDRED AMERICAN TRACTION BONDS WHICH HAD BEEN PLACED AS SECURITY WITH THE MARINE BANK FOR A LOAN OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MADE TO PAUL ARMSTRONG JUST BEFORE HIS CALIFORNIA TRIP
THE BOY WAS AN ARMSTRONG AND ENTITLED TO HIS FATHER'S SHARE OF THE ESTATE
CHAPTER XXVI HALSEY'S DISAPPEARANCE NOTHING THAT HAD GONE BEFORE HAD BEEN AS BAD AS THIS
I RECEIVED THEM IN THE LIVING-ROOM AND I HAD MADE UP MY MIND EXACTLY WHAT TO TELL
I HARDLY KNOW HOW I CAME TO THINK OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE AND THE UNGUARDED DOOR AT ITS FOOT
WHERE WE SAT IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM ONLY ONE OF THE SIDE BRACKETS WAS LIGHTED AND WE SPOKE IN SUBDUED TONES AS THE HOUR AND THE SUBJECT SEEMED TO DEMAND
SHE WAS NOT DEAD
TOOTHACHE I ASKED NOT TOO GENTLY
WHEN IT WAS FINISHED SHE STEPPED ASIDE WHILE I READ IT
NOW AND THEN WE GET A SIGHT OF THE THINGS INSIDE BUT WE ARE NOT A PART OF THEM DO YOU SUPPOSE GERTRUDE ASKED DOUBTFULLY THAT SHE REALLY MEANT THAT BLANKET FOR THOMAS THOMAS WAS STANDING BESIDE THAT MAGNOLIA TREE HALSEY REPLIED WHEN I RAN AFTER MRS WATSON
OH MISS RACHEL THERE'S GOING TO BE A DEATH THERE WILL BE I SAID GRIMLY IF YOU DON'T KEEP QUIET LIDDY ALLEN AND SO WE SAT THERE UNTIL MORNING WONDERING IF THE CANDLE WOULD LAST UNTIL DAWN AND ARRANGING WHAT TRAINS WE COULD TAKE BACK TO TOWN
I WAS KEYED TO SUCH A PITCH THAT I FELT NO FEAR
CHAPTER XXXII ANNE WATSON'S STORY LIDDY DISCOVERED THE FRESH BREAK IN THE TRUNK-ROOM WALL WHILE WE WERE AT LUNCHEON AND RAN SHRIEKING DOWN THE STAIRS
TO HALSEY AS TO ME THERE WAS EVER PRESENT I AM SURE THE THOUGHT OF OUR CONVERSATION OF THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE MAN SHE HAD CHOSEN STOOD ACCUSED OF A COLOSSAL EMBEZZLEMENT--AND EVEN WORSE
I HAD UNPACKED IT THE DAY BEFORE AND PUT IT ON HIS SHAVING-STAND AND THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE
WHEN SHE CAME IN SHE WAS HOLDING SOMETHING IN HER HAND AND SHE LAID IT ON THE DRESSING-TABLE CAREFULLY
SHOES I DIVINED--THE FEET OF THE GENTEEL POOR BEING ALMOST AS EXPENSIVE AS THEIR STOMACHS
THE TRINKET WAS ODD ENOUGH BUT NOT INTRINSICALLY OF GREAT VALUE
HOPE SPRANG UP AFRESH
THE EXAMINERS WERE STILL WORKING ON THE BOOKS OF THE TRADERS BANK AND IT WAS PROBABLE THAT SEVERAL WEEKS WOULD ELAPSE BEFORE EVERYTHING WAS CLEARED UP
MINE WAS A THIRTY-EIGHT CALIBER
THERE IS SOME ONE LOCKED IN THE LAUNDRY I REPLIED
HE'D BEEN READING THE PAPER DOWN-STAIRS
THE TRAMP AND THE BRAKEY WERE FRIENDLY AND THINGS GOING WELL
WHY DIDN'T YOU DO WHAT I ASKED YOU TO GERTRUDE
THE FIGURE OF A MAN UNCONSCIOUS GAGGED AND WITH HIS HANDS TIED LAY FAR AT THE END
THERE WAS JUST THE OPENING OF THE DOOR THE SHOT AND THE SOUND OF SOMEBODY FALLING THEN WHILE YOU WENT THROUGH THE DRAWING-ROOM AND UP-STAIRS TO ALARM THE HOUSEHOLD THE CRIMINAL WHOEVER IT WAS COULD HAVE ESCAPED BY THE EAST DOOR YES THANK YOU
IF LIDDY ONCE FINDS A PROPHECY FULFILLED ESPECIALLY AN UNPLEASANT ONE SHE NEVER ALLOWS ME TO FORGET IT
I HAVE BEEN DOING SOMETHING ELSE BUT--WELL I WILL COME OUT TO-NIGHT WE WERE VERY SILENT DURING THE TRIP BACK TO SUNNYSIDE
NOT AT THE TRAIN MA'M HE SAID
HALSEY YOU MUST NOT TRY TO SEE ME AGAIN
EVERYTHING THAT OCCURS ONLY CONFIRMS MY RESOLUTION TO STAY UNTIL THE MYSTERY IS CLEARED I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU MISS INNES HE SAID RISING AT LAST
AT THE TOP A WOMAN WAS STANDING AND A SECOND GLANCE SHOWED ME IT WAS ROSIE
HE WAS INTENSELY INTERESTED
RICHFIELD GERTRUDE EXCLAIMED
HE CAN'T HAVE GONE FAR HE SAID
I WAS GOING TO LET YOU THINK I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT LOUISE ARMSTRONG BUT I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND
SHE WAS DYING
I DID NOT TRY TO HEAR WHAT THEY SAID BUT EVERY WORD CAME THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR WITH CURIOUS DISTINCTNESS
MRS WATSON WAS FIXING A TRAY TO BE SENT IN TO ME AND WHEN I ASKED HER ABOUT ROSIE SHE CONFIRMED HER ABSENCE
THE HOUSE ON THE TOP OF A HILL WHICH SLOPED AWAY IN GREAT STRETCHES OF GREEN LAWN AND CLIPPED HEDGES TO THE ROAD
IN THE FIRST PLACE MR ARMSTRONG WAS SHOT FROM ABOVE
WE EXAMINED EVERY INCH OF TRACK
WHO KNOWS--IT MAY HAVE BEEN--LIDDY I STIRRED MY TEA ANGRILY
PERHAPS THE SITUATION HAD RENDERED ME ACUTE PERHAPS IT WAS INSTINCTIVE
BUT IF IT IS TRUE THE METAL ROD AND THE HOLE IN THE WALL WILL SHOW IT ELIZA LOOKED A LITTLE BIT SHEEPISH
I WENT SLOWLY ACROSS THE LAWN SKIRTED THE HEDGE TO A BREAK NOT FAR FROM THE LODGE AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE OPEN ROAD
ON THE SECOND FLOOR A LONG CORRIDOR RAN THE LENGTH OF THE HOUSE WITH ROOMS OPENING FROM BOTH SIDES
AFTER A HALF-HOUR OF SUSPENSE LOUISE WENT OUT QUIETLY AND DID NOT COME BACK
HE SEEMED TO BE DEBATING SOME QUESTION IN HIS MIND AND TO REACH A DECISION
THE WOMAN HAD GONE WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE
WHAT WAS THE MYSTERIOUS CAUSE OF THEIR SUDDEN FLIGHT
I WISH YOU WOULD WIRE HER MOTHER THAT SHE IS WITH ME AND TELL HER NOT TO WORRY
MR JAMIESON IF YOU WILL WATCH HERE I WILL GO TO THE LODGE AND FIND WARNER
I PUT HER ON THE DEFENSIVE AT ONCE
IT WAS EMPTY HALSEY THREW UP BOTH HANDS DESPAIRINGLY
ANY--WOMAN NO I REPLIED
WHEN I COULD HOLD A LIGHTED CANDLE IN THE OPENING I SAW PRECISELY WHAT I HAD SEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHIMNEY--A SPACE BETWEEN THE TRUE WALL AND THE FALSE ONE POSSIBLY SEVEN FEET LONG AND ABOUT THREE FEET WIDE
AND THEN--A FEELING OF HORROR ALMOST OVERWHELMED ME
IF IT WAS SHE WHO CAME HERE AS MATTIE BLISS WHAT DID SHE TELL HALSEY THAT SENT HIM RACING TO DOCTOR WALKER'S AND THEN TO MISS ARMSTRONG
AS I RAN ALONG THE CORRIDOR I WAS CONFIDENT THAT THE MYSTERIOUS INTRUDER AND PROBABLE MURDERER HAD BEEN FOUND AND THAT HE LAY DEAD OR DYING AT THE FOOT OF THE CHUTE
A PICTURE OF A LADY MARY ANNE INTERPOSED SHE WENT UP THE SERVANTS STAIRCASE AND ALONG THE CORRIDOR TO HER ROOM WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE TRUNK-ROOM AND THE UNFINISHED BALL-ROOM
SHE WENT INTO HER ROOM QUIETLY
I SAW LOUISE'S HANDS GROW RIGID AS THEY CLUTCHED THE ARMS OF HER CHAIR
I DIDN'T STEAL IT MR WINTERS HE WHINED
MY HEAD WAS CONFUSED
A LOYAL AND HONORABLE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS AT ONCE PHYSICIAN AND CONFIDENTIAL ADVISER TO HIS PATIENTS
HEART DISEASE SHE READ
THERE WAS AN OPEN FIREPLACE IN MY DRESSING-ROOM BUT NONE IN THE BEDROOM AND AS I LAY THERE LOOKING AROUND I THOUGHT OF SOMETHING THAT MADE ME SIT UP SUDDENLY
I WENT UP WITH HIM MYSELF BUT HE ONLY LOOKED AROUND MR JAMIESON SMILED
THEN--I HEARD GERTRUDE STIRRING IN HER ROOM AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE HAD THROWN OPEN THE CONNECTING DOOR
THERE ARE FOUR WOMEN NAMED WALLACE AT KING'S NONE OF THEM MARRIED AND NONE OVER TWENTY
NOW ELIZA WHEN YOU HAVE WASHED YOUR FACE AND STOPPED BAWLING I SAID COME INTO MY SITTING-ROOM AND TELL ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED LIDDY PUT AWAY MY THINGS WITHOUT SPEAKING
NEITHER ONE OF YOU COULD GET ALONG FOR AN HOUR WITHOUT THE OTHER
LET ME PRESENT JOHN BAILEY ONLY YOU MUST CALL HIM JACK
ALSO I REPLIED COLDLY MR ARMSTRONG IS FOR EVER BEYOND THE POWER OF DEFENDING HIMSELF
THAT HER FEELING FOR ME WAS WHAT IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN BUT THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED WHICH HAD CHANGED HER IDEAS AS TO THE FUTURE
CHAPTER XVIII A HOLE IN THE WALL MY TAKING THE DETECTIVE OUT TO SUNNYSIDE RAISED AN UNEXPECTED STORM OF PROTEST FROM GERTRUDE AND HALSEY
AS TO THE REASON FOR LOUISE'S FLIGHT FROM CALIFORNIA OR WHY SHE HAD NOT GONE TO THE FITZHUGHS OR TO SOME OF HER PEOPLE IN TOWN HE HAD NO MORE INFORMATION THAN I HAD
I RATHER EXPECTED THE CAR BUT WE GOT UP ALL RIGHT YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM AT ALL LOUISE DEMANDED BREATHLESSLY
IT WAS BACK WITH HALSEY ON THAT MEMORABLE NIGHT
I AM GRAY I ADMIT BUT I HAVEN'T FELT AS WELL IN A DOZEN YEARS
THE PLANS WE MADE TOGETHER THE HOPES THE--ALL OF IT--OVER
HOW CAN I THANK YOU MISS INNES SHE SAID
THANK YOU
I NO LONGER BELIEVED THAT HE WAS A GARDENER
ONLY--AND LIDDY ALWAYS SCREAMS AND PUTS HER FINGERS IN HER EARS AT THIS POINT--ONLY NOW I WAS NOT ALONE IN THE CHIMNEY ROOM
AND MIND IF I HEAR OF THIS STORY BEING REPEATED TO THE OTHER MAIDS I SHALL DEDUCT FROM YOUR WAGES FOR EVERY BROKEN DISH I FIND IN THE DRIVE I LISTENED TO ROSIE AS SHE WENT UP-STAIRS RUNNING PAST THE SHADOWY PLACES AND SLAMMING HER DOOR
WE WENT ACROSS THE FIELDS PASSING THROUGH THE WOODS THAT REACHED ALMOST TO THE RUINS OF THE STABLE GOING OVER STILES NOW AND THEN AND SOMETIMES STEPPING OVER LOW FENCES
SHE WAS THIN AND COLORLESS AND ALL HER BRIGHT ANIMATION WAS GONE
SHE LOOKED LIKE A CRIMINAL WHOSE REPRIEVE IS OVER AND THE DAY OF EXECUTION APPROACHING
ONLY ONE THING SEEMED UNUSUAL TO ME
AT LAST WHEN HER SORROW HAD SUBSIDED TO THE DRY SHAKING SOBS OF A TIRED CHILD WITHOUT RAISING HER HEAD SHE PUT OUT ONE GROPING HAND
AND SHE IS TOO HONEST TO PRETEND ANYTHING ELSE
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK PERHAPS EARLIER A TERRIFIC CRASH AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE CAR ROUSED HIM
SHOT HE SAID
HIS OLD TRICKS HE SAID
IF THE SCRAPS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MYSTERY ORDINARY CONVENTIONS HAD NO VALUE
THE INTRUDER WAS GONE
HE TRIED TO SEE THE ARCHITECT OF THE BUILDING BUT LIKE THE CONTRACTOR IF HE KNEW OF THE SUCH A ROOM HE REFUSED ANY INFORMATION
AT THE LODGE EVERYTHING WAS QUIET
I RECOGNIZED A MR JARVIS BUT THE OTHERS WERE STRANGERS
MY SISTER WAS THERE MRS OGDEN FITZHUGH HAD THE COURAGE TO TURN AND EYE GERTRUDE THROUGH HER LORGNON
IT WAS OF ITALIAN WORKMANSHIP AND CONSISTED OF A MOTHER-OF-PEARL FOUNDATION ENCRUSTED WITH TINY SEED-PEARLS STRUNG ON HORSEHAIR TO HOLD THEM
I HAD NOT GONE TO SLEEP AND I HEARD IT
SOMETIME PERHAPS I SAID
SHE WANTED A PERMIT TO ADMIT THE YOUNGSTER TO THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN TOWN HERE WHERE I AM A MEMBER OF THE STAFF AND I GAVE HER ONE
HE RAN UP THE STAIRS TWO AT A TIME AND HIS FACE WAS FLUSHED AND FURIOUS
YOU ARE THE ONLY MOTHER I EVER HAD SHE SAID TENSELY
THE ANXIOUS MOTHER CERTAINLY HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT HER DAUGHTER WAS IN GOOD HANDS
IT WAS THE DAY OF THOMAS FUNERAL IN THE VILLAGE AND ALEX AND I WERE IN THE CONSERVATORY CUTTING FLOWERS FOR THE OLD MAN'S CASKET
YOU CAN BLISTER IT IF YOU LIKE
I FELT THAT MY COMPOSURE WAS GOING AND FOR FEAR I WOULD SHRIEK I TRIED TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE--WHAT TIME GERTRUDE WOULD REACH HALSEY--ANYTHING BUT THE GRISLY REALITY THAT LAY JUST BEYOND ME ON THE GRASS
HAVEN'T YOU A THUMB-PRINT TOO I HAVE HE SAID WITH A SMILE AND THE PRINT OF A FOOT IN A TULIP BED AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS
WHEN I LOOK BACK OVER THE MONTHS I SPENT AT SUNNYSIDE I WONDER THAT I SURVIVED AT ALL
THE FAMILY CONSISTS OF YOURSELF ALONE MISS INNES MY NIECE IS HERE I SAID
HE DECIDED TO DIE TO ALL APPEARANCES AND WHEN THE HUE AND CRY SUBSIDED HE WOULD BE ABLE TO ENJOY HIS MONEY ALMOST ANYWHERE HE WISHED
HE WAS PAINFULLY SPRUCE IN HIS APPEARANCE AND HIS MANNER WAS ALMOST OBTRUSIVELY POLITE
AND OUR GHOST
I WANT YOU TO ADOPT HIM INTO YOUR AFFECTIONS AND YOUR SATURDAY-TO-MONDAY LIST
AND THEN BECAUSE I COULD THINK OF NO OTHER REASON FOR MY STATEMENT I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE PEARL CUFF-LINK
I WAS COLLAPSED--AND THEN MR JARVIS ASKED ME A QUESTION THAT BROUGHT BACK MY WANDERING FACULTIES
SOME ONE HAD BEEN SHOT BY THE BULLET THAT WENT THROUGH THE DOOR
HE HAD SOLD THE CUFF-LINKS BUT ON OFFERING THE WATCH TO ALEX HE HAD BEEN COPPED THE STORY WITH ITS COLD RECITAL OF VILLAINY WAS DONE
BEGAN IT AS A JOKE ON ROSIE AND ENDED BY PICKING UP THE BROKEN CHINA OUT OF THE ROAD KNOWING IT WOULD PLAY HOB WITH THE TIRES OF THE CAR WHICH SHOWS HOW NEAR ONE CAN COME TO THE TRUTH AND YET MISS IT ALTOGETHER
I TURNED TO MARY
OF THEIR FACE VALUE IN CASH IN CASH BUT THE MAN WHO DID IT--HE WOULD BE KNOWN YES
BUT SHE WOULD HAVE NONE OF THE ACID AND SHE KEPT ME AWAKE GROANING SO AT LAST I GOT UP AND WENT TO GERTRUDE'S DOOR
LIDDY DISTURBED ME JUST AS I WAS GROWING DROWSY BY COMING IN AND PEERING UNDER THE BED
THE CARD-ROOM WAS QUITE DARK
A GIRL WAS ASLEEP THERE--OR IN A HALF STUPOR FOR SHE MUTTERED SOMETHING NOW AND THEN
LISTEN SHE SAID STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR AND HOLDING ON TO ME
YAS SAH HE SAID
MANY THINGS HAD OCCURRED WHICH WERE NOT BROUGHT OUT AT THE INQUEST AND SOME THINGS WERE TOLD THERE THAT WERE NEW TO ME
IT WAS A TALLER MAN THAN MR ARNOLD
SOME REDDISH STAINS SHOWED IT HAD DONE EXECUTION
HAD THE ISSUES BEEN LESS VITAL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSURD
SHE STOOD GAZING DOWN AT THAT GRUESOME FIGURE ON THE FLOOR WHILE LIDDY ASHAMED OF HER FLIGHT AND AFRAID TO COME BACK ALONE DROVE BEFORE HER THREE TERRIFIED WOMEN-SERVANTS INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM WHICH WAS AS NEAR AS ANY OF THEM WOULD VENTURE
IT'S ONLY A WOMAN--MAYBE A MAID OF THE ARMSTRONGS GET UP AND HELP ME FIND THE DOOR SHE GROANED AGAIN
OUR EARS WERE STRAINED FOR THE FIRST THROB OF THE MOTOR AS IT TURNED INTO THE DRIVE AND COMMENCED THE CLIMB TO THE HOUSE
INDEED HE WOULD BE QUITE CAPABLE OF IT SHE SEEMED SCARCELY TO HEAR MY FACETIOUS TONE
WE WILL HAVE A THREE-CORNERED TALK AND THEN GERTRUDE HERSELF CAME DOWN THE STAIRS
IT IS ALWAYS WITH ME SHE CRIED
AND YOU TO GERTRUDE
MR JAMIESON EXAMINED THEM WITH LIVELY SATISFACTION AND PASSED THEM TO ME
AND IN MY DRESSING-ROOM LIDDY HUGGED A COLD HOT-WATER BOTTLE AND MUMBLED IN HER SLEEP
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STRANGE THINGS CONNECTED WITH THIS CASE THE DETECTIVE WENT ON
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY FALSE CLUES CAME POURING IN AND RAISED HOPES THAT CRUMBLED AGAIN TO NOTHING
THAT WAS HOW THINGS STOOD THAT TUESDAY EVENING
I SAW IT IN THE PAPER TO-NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WAS SAYING
I DID NOT MOVE FOR A MOMENT
I RETIRED TO MY UPSTAIRS SITTING-ROOM AND GOT OUT ELIZA KLINEFELTER'S LAVENDER SLIPPERS
NOW MRS TATE I AM GOING TO PAY LAST WEEK'S BOARD AND A WEEK IN ADVANCE
IF WE HAD ONLY STUCK TO THAT DECISION AND GONE BACK BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE
WE HAVE MADE GUARDED INQUIRY AT THE GREENWOOD CLUB AND THROUGH THE VILLAGE
I TRIED TO WARN HIM NONSENSE I SAID AS BRISKLY AS I COULD
MR JAMIESON HAVING FAILED TO LOCATE THE SECRET ROOM HAD GONE TO THE VILLAGE
AN OLD WOMAN AND A DAUGHTER WHO IS VERY LAME LIVE THERE
ALL THAT MORNING WHILE GERTRUDE READ ALOUD AND LIDDY WATCHED FOR THE DOCTOR I WAS PUZZLING OVER THAT VOICE WITHOUT RESULT
MRS OGDEN FITZHUGH A COUSIN TOOK CHARGE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS AND EVERYTHING I BELIEVE WAS AS QUIET AS POSSIBLE
SHE STRUCK ME AS BEING AN UGLY CUSTOMER AND WHEN SHE LEFT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND WENT ACROSS TO THE ARMSTRONG PLACE I WAS NOT FAR BEHIND HER
THAT AFTERNOON I HAD A NEW INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER OF THE DEAD BANKER
THEN I WAKENED AND--I GOT TO THINKING ABOUT THINGS AND WORRYING SO I COULD NOT GO TO SLEEP
IT WAS BACON HARDTACK AND ONIONS FRIED TOGETHER
THE TRAMP LOST NO TIME
AND YET--WHILE I OUGHT TO SAY NOTHING BUT GOOD OF THE DEAD--MR ARMSTRONG SAW NOTHING OF THIS FAIR PROSPECT
THAT ISN'T ALL HALSEY SHE SAID
I WAS MUCH USED UP THE DAY AFTER THE FIRE AND GERTRUDE INSISTED ON MY GOING OUT
EVEN THE CELLARS WERE GIVEN A THOROUGH OVERHAULING WITHOUT RESULT
MISS INNES I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT HE HAS MET WITH BAD TREATMENT IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE
AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE I REPEATED ITS CONTENTS TO HIM WHILE HALSEY TOOK THEM DOWN IN A NOTE-BOOK
THE STEP SLOW MEASURED INFINITELY CAUTIOUS WAS NEARER NOW
IT TONES THE STOMACH
HOW DID IT GET THERE
NEARLY A HUNDRED DOLLARS
THE BUSINESS ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN ADDED TO THE BELIEF THAT BAILEY KNEW SOMETHING OF THE LOOTING
GERTRUDE WITH HALSEY FOUND AND IMPROVING IN HEALTH AND WITH AT LAST SOMETHING TO WORK ON I BEGAN THAT DAY THURSDAY WITH FRESH COURAGE
THOMAS WAS AN OLD FAMILY SERVANT HAVING BEEN WITH THE PRESENT MRS ARMSTRONG SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD AND HE WAS OVERWHELMED AT SEEING LOUISE
I TELEPHONED TO THE HOSPITAL THAT DAY HOWEVER AND ORDERED A PRIVATE ROOM FOR HER AND WHATEVER COMFORTS SHE MIGHT BE ALLOWED
THERE'S SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T HANDCUFF LIDDY WAS RIGHT
WHEN I SAW HER YESTERDAY IT WAS THE SAME THING ONLY PERHAPS WORSE HALSEY I ASKED HAVE YOU ANY IDEA OF THE NATURE OF THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN LOUISE ARMSTRONG AND ARNOLD THE NIGHT HE WAS MURDERED IT WAS STORMY
THOMAS I'M AFRAID YOU'VE BEEN MALINGERING THOMAS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DEBATING SOMETHING WITH HIMSELF
IF I HAD HOPED TO LEARN ANYTHING FROM HER EXPRESSION I HAD FAILED
CHAPTER XI HALSEY MAKES A CAPTURE IT WAS ABOUT HALF-PAST EIGHT WHEN WE LEFT THE DINING-ROOM AND STILL ENGROSSED WITH ONE SUBJECT THE FAILURE OF THE BANK AND ITS ATTENDANT EVILS HALSEY AND I WENT OUT INTO THE GROUNDS FOR A STROLL GERTRUDE FOLLOWED US SHORTLY
BURNS TRACED HIM THERE
I REASONED THAT AN IRON BAR FOR INSTANCE WOULD DO SOMETHING OF THE SORT,--STRIKE TWO OR THREE STEPS END DOWN THEN TURN OVER JUMPING A FEW STAIRS AND LANDING WITH A THUD
WHEN SHE CAME HOWEVER I COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN A GASP OF SURPRISE
SHE STILL WORE THE WHITE NEGLIGEE SHE HAD WORN EARLIER IN THE EVENING AND SHE LIMPED SOMEWHAT
REALLY MISS INNES DON'T YOU THINK YOU EXAGGERATE
IT HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING ME LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER TO SEE WHAT SHE WAS STARING AT AND WAS INTENSELY IRRITATING
IT WAS ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK WHEN THE HACK CAME FROM THE STATION TO GET THEM AND TO MY AMAZEMENT IT HAD AN OCCUPANT
MRS WATSON HAD BEEN GLAD ENOUGH I THINK TO TURN LOUISE OVER TO OUR CARE AND THOMAS WENT UPSTAIRS NIGHT AND MORNING TO GREET HIS YOUNG MISTRESS FROM THE DOORWAY
GOOD GRACIOUS AUNT RAY SHE EXCLAIMED WHAT IS THE MATTER THERE'S SOMEBODY LOCKED IN THE LAUNDRY I PANTED
MISS INNES HE SAID QUICKLY WILL YOU COME WITH ME AND LIGHT THE EAST CORRIDOR
NO OF COURSE IT ISN'T LIKELY OR POSSIBLE
MRS ARMSTRONG ARRIVED MONDAY EVENING WITH HER HUSBAND'S BODY AND THE SERVICES WERE SET FOR THE NEXT DAY
THAT JAMIESON'S DOWN THERE NOW
THE OTHER HAS NOT BEEN PAID WAS HE ILL WHEN HE CAME NO SIR NOT WHAT YOU'D CALL SICK
IT WAS AN ADDRESS IN FRESH INK LUCIEN WALLACE 14 ELM STREET RICHFIELD
NOW THE SOUNDS BELOW REDOUBLED
HER PRIVATE SITTING-ROOM BEDROOM AND DRESSING-ROOM WERE AS THEY HAD BEEN WHEN WE CAME
THE PATH FROM THE GREENWOOD CLUB TO THE VILLAGE ENTERS THE ROAD NEAR THE LODGE GATE
HOW--DOES--IT--OPEN BUT THE MAN IN THE ROOM HAD CHANGED HIS TACTICS
THE DAY HOWEVER WAS A LONG VIGIL WITH EVERY RING OF THE TELEPHONE FULL OF POSSIBILITIES
I PUT ON MY BONNET AND SENT FOR WHAT THE CASANOVA LIVERYMAN CALLED A STYLISH TURNOUT HAVING ONCE MADE UP MY MIND TO A COURSE OF ACTION I AM NOT ONE TO TURN BACK
HE HAD BEEN ADVISED HE SAID THAT MRS ARMSTRONG WAS COMING EAST WITH HER HUSBAND'S BODY AND WOULD ARRIVE MONDAY
IT OCCURRED LATE IN CASES OF SUDDEN DEATH
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW HOW MANY IMPORTANT THINGS NEVER TRANSPIRED
FOR A MOMENT HE COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING DISTINCTLY IN THE DARKENED ROOM
IS IT--BECAUSE THERE IS SOME ONE ELSE YES ALMOST INAUDIBLY
IF IT WAS ARNOLD I KNEW I MUST SEE HIM
SHE WAS GREENISH-WHITE AND SHE HAD A RED AND BLACK BARRED FLANNEL PETTICOAT OVER HER SHOULDERS
SOME TIME AFTER ONE ON SATURDAY HE HAD ENTERED THE WESTERN UNION OFFICE AT CHERRY AND WHITE STREETS AND HAD SENT TWO TELEGRAMS
WINTERS TOLD THE STORY IN A DOZEN WORDS
WHEN HE OFFERED THE WATCH TO ME I KNEW IT AND I PRETENDED I WAS GOING TO BUY IT
IT WAS THE SAME FORMULA
THEN TOO I WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT THE CHILDREN
WITH MY MOUTH OPEN TO SCREAM I STOPPED
HE CUT OUT REDUNDANT TONSILS AND BROUGHT THE BABIES WITH THE SAME AIR OF INSPIRING SELF-CONFIDENCE
THEN I HEARD HIM MUTTER SOMETHING
SHE WAS HARDLY HERSELF YET BUT PRIVATELY I THINK SHE WAS WORRYING ABOUT THE BROKEN MIRROR AND ITS AUGURY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
IT WAS A RATTLING METALLIC SOUND AND IT REVERBERATED ALONG THE EMPTY HALLS LIKE THE CRASH OF DOOM
THEY WOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF THE VAULT BY SOME ONE WHO HAD ACCESS TO IT AND USED AS COLLATERAL FOR A LOAN IN ANOTHER BANK
THEN MORE LIGHTLY
HAVE YOU REASON TO BELIEVE MISS INNES THE CORONER ASKED THAT ANY MEMBER OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD IMAGINING MR ARMSTRONG WAS A BURGLAR SHOT HIM IN SELF-DEFENSE I HAVE NO REASON FOR THINKING SO I SAID QUIETLY
THE MANTEL WITH AN OATH THE FIGURE HURLED ITSELF ACROSS THE ROOM AT ME AND I SCREAMED AGAIN
ANY ONE WHO MIGHT WISH HIM OUT OF THE WAY NOT THAT I KNOW OF UNLESS--NO I CAN NOT THINK OF ANY WAS HE IN THE HABIT OF CARRYING MONEY HE NEVER CARRIED IT FAR
WHEN I CAME TO IT WAS DAWN
EVIDENTLY SHE COLLIDED WITH THE CANDLE FOR IT WENT OUT AND I WAS LEFT IN DARKNESS
WHEN THE DOCTOR DIDN'T COME BACK SHE WAS IN AN AWFUL WAY
IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD SCHEME
I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO BREATHE FREELY WHEN MR JAMIESON WHO HAD BEEN STANDING BY THE WINDOW CAME OVER TO ME
THERE ARE PLENTY OF WALLACES AROUND BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY LUCIEN I WAS AS CERTAIN AS POSSIBLE THAT HE DID
I WAS COMING UP THE DRIVE SHE BEGAN
AND HE KEPT MUMBLING ABOUT HAVING SEEN A GHOST
I DON'T WANT TO GO AUNT RAY SHE SAID
SHE SAID SHE HAD FALLEN DOWN-STAIRS IN HER EXCITEMENT
IF GERTRUDE HAD BEEN ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE THAT NIGHT WHY HAD SHE FLED FROM MR JAMIESON
THE GUILT OF THE DEFUNCT PRESIDENT WAS NO LONGER IN DOUBT
BUT NOT ANOTHER WORD WOULD SHE SAY
IT WAS FULLY A HALF-HOUR BEFORE LIDDY'S GROANS SUBSIDED
ABOUT THE REQUEST THAT WE GIVE UP THE LEASE TO SUNNYSIDE ABOUT THE TELEGRAM TO LOUISE ABOUT THE RUMORS OF AN APPROACHING MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE GIRL AND DOCTOR WALKER AND LAST OF ALL MY OWN INTERVIEW WITH HER THE DAY BEFORE
DOCTOR WALKER HAD TAKEN UP HIS PRACTICE AGAIN AND WE SAW HIM NOW AND THEN FLYING PAST ALONG THE ROAD ALWAYS AT TOP SPEED
I DID NOT BELIEVE HER
BUT FIRST OF ALL DID YOU BRING WHAT YOU PROMISED RIGGS PRODUCED A ROLL OF PAPERS FROM UNDER HIS COAT AND HANDED THEM OVER
I THINK THE DOCTOR WANTED TO SEND ME BACK
I WENT UP THE WALK TO THE HOUSE WHERE A BRASS SIGN AT THE SIDE ANNOUNCED THE OFFICE AND WENT IN
WE THOUGHT PERHAPS HIS MOTHER WOULD BE HERE TO-DAY MR JAMIESON STEPPED FORWARD
IF YOU SAY HE IS NOT YOU--YOU GERTRUDE HALSEY BROKE IN SHARPLY
WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THE SUBTLE CHANGE IN GERTRUDE
THERE WAS NO KEY IN THE LOCK OR ON THE FLOOR
TELL ME WHERE YOU WENT THAT NIGHT OR RATHER MORNING AND WHY YOU WENT AS YOU DID
POOR THOMAS
POOR THOMAS
MISS INNES THE DETECTIVE SAID GETTING UP I BELIEVE THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE WALLS OF THIS HOUSE IS HIDDEN SOME OF THE MONEY AT LEAST FROM THE TRADERS BANK
HER NAME WAS CARRINGTON AND THE DOCTOR MADE THINGS PRETTY STRONG
IT WAILED A CRESCENDO OF WOE THAT TRAILED OFF HOPEFULLY ONLY TO BREAK OUT AFRESH FROM A NEW POINT OF THE COMPASS
HE GOT ON THE FAST FREIGHT EAST SOME TIME AFTER AND RODE INTO THE CITY
SHE SLIPPED DOWN QUIETLY AND OPENED THE DOOR
THERE'S ONE THING SURE--I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY
I HAVE BROUGHT A GUEST AUNT RAY HALSEY SAID
I WON'T BELIEVE YOU YOU DON'T KNOW
ARNOLD ARMSTRONG AND HIS FATHER RESTED SIDE BY SIDE IN THE CASANOVA CHURCHYARD AND AT THE ZION AFRICAN CHURCH ON THE HILL A NEW MOUND MARKED THE LAST RESTING-PLACE OF POOR THOMAS
SHE WENT UP-STAIRS HARDLY KNOWING WHAT SHE WAS DOING
IT WAS HALF-PAST SIX BY THAT TIME AND GROWING DUSK
THEN WE HEARD HALSEY RUNNING UP THE MAIN STAIRCASE
I AM AN IMPOSTOR ON YOUR SYMPATHY BECAUSE I--I STAY HERE AND LET YOU LAVISH CARE ON ME AND ALL THE TIME I KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO DESPISE ME NONSENSE I SAID BRISKLY
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I FEARED BUT IT WAS A RELIEF TO FIND HIM THERE VERY SOUND ASLEEP AND WITH HIS DOOR UNLOCKED
AND THEN GERTRUDE HELD OUT BOTH HANDS TO HIM APPEALINGLY
WHEN SHE SAW US SHE UNTIED HER GINGHAM APRON AND CAME AROUND TO THE PORCH
EVERYTHING WAS AS WE HAD LEFT IT
MR JARVIS WAS CALLED NEXT BUT HIS TESTIMONY AMOUNTED TO LITTLE
THERE'S NO ONE TRYING TO GET IN
ONCE WHEN THROUGH A MISCALCULATION I JUMPED A LITTLE SHORT OVER A DITCH AND LANDED ABOVE MY SHOE-TOPS IN THE WATER AND OOZE I REMEMBER WONDERING IF THIS WERE REALLY I AND IF I HAD EVER TASTED LIFE UNTIL THAT SUMMER
YOU SHOULD HAVE A CHANGE I SHAN'T STIR A FOOT SHE WAS EQUALLY DECIDED
THERE HAD BEEN AN N
WITNESS THE INCIDENT WITH THE COOK YESTERDAY
THE INNESES NEVER DO GERTRUDE WHO HAD BEEN STANDING ALOOF AT A WINDOW TURNED SUDDENLY
OH I DON'T BELIEVE IT IT IS TRUE SHE SAID SADLY
I FLATTER MYSELF SHE FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH EITHER HER GOWN OR HER MANNER BUT POOR GERTRUDE'S TESTIMONY WAS THE REVERSE OF COMFORTING
CHAPTER XXIX A SCRAP OF PAPER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY YEARS I KEPT MY BED THAT DAY
I DECIDED TO KEEP WHAT CLUES I HAD THE CUFF-LINK THE GOLF-STICK AND THE REVOLVER IN A SECURE PLACE UNTIL I COULD SEE SOME REASON FOR DISPLAYING THEM
WITH HALSEY FOUND MY TROUBLES HAVE GONE I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT
I WAS REALLY ASTONISHINGLY COOL
I HAD BROUGHT MY OWN CHINA AND SILVER AND FROM ALL APPEARANCES I WOULD HAVE LITTLE ENOUGH TO TAKE BACK
TRUST A WOMAN TO ADD TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AND MAKE SIX TO WHICH I RETORT THAT IF TWO AND TWO PLUS X MAKE SIX THEN TO DISCOVER THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IS THE SIMPLEST THING IN THE WORLD
I GOT HIM AWAY FINALLY BY SENDING HIM TO FIX UP THE CAR AS A SORT OF AMBULANCE IN CASE THE DOCTOR WOULD ALLOW THE SICK GIRL TO BE MOVED
IT IS ALL KNOWN NOW AND YET THE WHOLE THING WAS SO REMARKABLE THAT PERHAPS MY STUPIDITY WAS EXCUSABLE
AUNT RAY IT WAS NECESSARY FOR JACK AND ME TO LEAVE THAT NIGHT
THE FOLLOWING MORNING LOUISE HAD BEEN ILL
I SAT AND KNITTED PRETENDING NOT TO NOTICE WHEN GERTRUDE GOT UP AND WANDERED OUT INTO THE STARLIGHT
TO THOMAS
MY CITY HOME IS DISMANTLED AND IN THE HANDS OF DECORATORS
GERTRUDE I DON'T THINK HALSEY KNEW THE--THE MURDERED MAN DID HE BUT MR JAMIESON WAS SURE OF HIS GROUND
THE CONNIVANCE OF DOCTOR WALKER WAS SUGGESTED BY HIS LOVE FOR LOUISE
THERE WAS APPARENTLY NO FLUE AND I KNEW THERE WAS NONE IN THE HALL JUST BENEATH
MOREOVER HE SUSPECTED WHAT LOUISE DID NOT THAT THE MONEY WAS HIDDEN AT SUNNYSIDE
I STOPPED THERE WITH MY AUTOMOBILE FOR GASOLENE
WHO IS NINA CARRINGTON HE ASKED
YOU MIGHT THINK OVER MY OFFER IN THE MEANTIME HE WENT ON THROUGH THE DRAWING-ROOM AND I LISTENED TO HIS FOOTSTEPS GROWING GRADUALLY FAINTER
HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE SIMPLE
SOMETHIN HIT ME ON THE FACE AND I SET UP SUDDEN
DID EITHER OF THEM KNOW WHERE HALSEY WAS OR WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
WHEN HE SAID THAT I SCREAMED AND DUCKED UNDER HIS ARM LIKE THIS
NO I DO NOT KNOW WHY SHE CAME EAST BUT MY DEAR MISS INNES MRS FITZHUGH BEGAN
I SAID TO MRS STEWART HE CONFIDED A LITTLE RED IN THE FACE FROM THE EXERTION AFTER I WENT HOME THE OTHER DAY THAT YOU WOULD THINK ME AN OLD GOSSIP FOR SAYING WHAT I DID ABOUT WALKER AND MISS LOUISE NOTHING OF THE SORT I PROTESTED
ALSO I ACQUIRED A GREAT MANY THINGS
I WANT YOU PRESENT AT THIS INTERVIEW MISS INNES HE SAID
WHEN YOU GET TO THINKING ABOUT IT AUNT RAY IT LOOKS BAD FOR ALL THREE OF US DOESN'T IT
IT'S THE MOST MADDENING HUMILIATING EXISTENCE IN THE WORLD
THEY WILL KNOW IF THOMAS HAD ANY PEOPLE AND HOW TO REACH THEM
IF HE HAD SEEN HIM HE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN OF IT THANK YOU
AS I WENT DOWN THE DRIVE MY THOUGHTS WERE BUSY
WE HAVE BEEN THANKFUL ENOUGH SO FAR TO HAVE OUR MEALS PREPARED AND SERVED AND THE BEDS AIRED
WHY ELM STREET IS THE MAIN STREET
IT WAS SOMETHING SHE HAD TOLD HALSEY THAT HAD TAKEN HIM FRANTICALLY TO DOCTOR WALKER'S OFFICE AND FROM THERE PERHAPS TO HIS DEATH
AND I KNEW THAT WHAT I WANTED TO DO MUST BE DONE BEFORE SHE CAME BACK
BUT PERHAPS YOU WILL KNOW THE INITIALS
GIRLS IN MY DAY DID NOT MEEKLY ACCEPT THE PUBLIC'S VERDICT AS TO THE MAN THEY LOVED
AND IN CAME ELIZA FLANKED BY ROSIE AND MARY ANNE
IF HALSEY AND JACK BAILEY HAD LEFT BEFORE THE CRIME HOW CAME HALSEY'S REVOLVER IN THE TULIP BED
AT FOUR O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING WE WERE STILL WAITING FOR NEWS WHILE ALEX WATCHED THE HOUSE AND SAM THE GROUNDS
THAT HAD BEEN ON SATURDAY
THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NOTHING MORE TO BE DISCOVERED
DOCTOR STEWART--THAT WAS THE ENGLEWOOD DOCTOR--STAYED ALMOST ALL NIGHT GIVING THE MEDICINE HIMSELF AND WATCHING HER CLOSELY
DOCTOR WALKER WOULD DO ANYTHING HE COULD TO GET ME AWAY FROM SUNNYSIDE
THERE ARE FEW THINGS HE IS AFRAID OF
WARNER WHAT DID HE SAY WHEN YOU FOUND HIM ON THE PORCH WARNER LOOKED SHAKEN
I ALWAYS ENDED WHERE I BEGAN
SOME ONE WAS STEALTHILY-PASSING THE HEAD OF THE STAIRCASE AND COMING TOWARD ME IN THE DARK
THOMAS HAD NOT THE MORAL COURAGE TO TELL HER OF THE CRIME
BRIEFLY THEN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S STORY WAS THIS
WITH ALL MY HEART I WISHED FOR HALSEY BUT I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED
I FIXED ON AN ATTEMPT AT BURGLARY AS THE MOST NATURAL EXPLANATION--AN ATTEMPT FRUSTRATED BY THE FALLING OF THE OBJECT WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HAD ROUSED ME
HIS POSITION AT THAT TIME WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
THE SUDDEN CHANGE THREW THE WINDOW INTO RELIEF AN OBLONG OF GRAYISH LIGHT AND SHOWED US A FIGURE STANDING CLOSE PEERING IN
MATTIE BLISS HAD BEEN NINA CARRINGTON
BUT YOU MAY STAY IN THE DRESSING-ROOM IF YOU WILL LIE ON THE COUCH
HOW TO BE BEAUTIFUL HE QUOTED
AND YET THAT NIGHT IN THE CASANOVA CHURCHYARD I SAT QUIETLY BY AND WATCHED ALEX AND MR JAMIESON STEAMING OVER THEIR WORK WITHOUT A SINGLE QUALM EXCEPT THE FEAR OF DETECTION
MY PROFESSIONAL DUTIES ARE URGENT AND LONG NEGLECTED AND"--A FALL TO THE EVERY-DAY MANNER--"SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THAT BODY YES I SAID SITTING ON THE EDGE OF MY CHAIR
IN SUPPORT OF HER STORY SHE CARRIED IN MY WET AND MUDDY BOOTS THAT I HAD UNLUCKILY FORGOTTEN TO HIDE AND HELD THEM OUT TO THE DETECTIVE AND MYSELF
THE NEXT QUESTION REQUIRED MORE DIPLOMACY
HE STOOD IN THE DOORWAY A MOMENT AND THEN HE WENT INTO AGONIES OF SILENT MIRTH
WE ATE ONLY WHEN LIDDY BROUGHT IN A TRAY AND THEN VERY LITTLE
GERTRUDE SPENT ALMOST ALL THE TIME WITH HER AND THE TWO HAD GROWN TO BE GREAT FRIENDS
WHO WAS NINA CARRINGTON
WHO WAS NINA CARRINGTON
IF IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WILL SAVE TIME THERE WAS A PAUSE WHILE MR HARTON OPENED THE TELEGRAM
HE FLUNG THE WHITE OBJECT AT ME AND JERKING OPEN THE OUTER DOOR RACED INTO THE DARKNESS
AS MR JAMIESON HAD SAID THE LINES WERE CLOSING UP
FROM A CORNER MR JAMIESON WAS WATCHING THE PROCEEDINGS INTENTLY
I WAS WONDERING WHY I HAD NOT HEARD FROM ARNOLD SINCE THE--SINCE I SAW HIM THAT NIGHT AT THE LODGE
AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF EARSHOT HE TURNED TO ME
ISN'T HE HERE I ASKED
BELOW LAY THE VILLAGE OF CASANOVA WITH ITS OLD WORLD HOUSES ITS BLOSSOMING TREES AND ITS PEACE
IT'S THE HACK I AM SURE SHE SAID EVIDENTLY RELIEVED
WATCH FOR NINA CARRINGTON
WATCH FOR NINA CARRINGTON
SHE HAD NOT UNDRESSED
SLEEP WAS IMPOSSIBLE I THINK FOR ANY OF US
DID YOU SEE IF THERE WAS ANY ONE MISSING IN THE HOUSE I ASKED IGNORING THE ARRAY OF SAUCE-PANS ROLLING-PINS AND THE POKER OF THE RANGE
THE ESTATE OF THE DEAD MAN WAS COMPARATIVELY SMALL--A CITY HOUSE ON A FASHIONABLE STREET SUNNYSIDE A LARGE ESTATE LARGELY MORTGAGED AN INSURANCE OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SOME PERSONAL PROPERTY--THIS WAS ALL
NO HE SAID
I KNEW SAM HUSTON WELL
ALL RIGHT I SAID
SHALL I BRING HIM IN I ASKED LOUISE UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO
YOU MAY HAVE DREAMED IT IN YOUR FAINTING ATTACK
AFTER LUNCHEON MR JAMIESON SUGGESTED THAT I GO WITH HIM TO RICHFIELD AND I CONSENTED
I AM SORRY IN MORE THAN ONE WAY
THAT IT WAS HALSEY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
I CAN'T ASK LOUISE TO SHARE NOTHING A YEAR WITH ME AND WHEN I THINK OF THIS DISGRACE FOR HER I'M CRAZY THE MOST ORDINARY EVENTS OF LIFE SEEMED PREGNANT WITH POSSIBILITIES THAT DAY AND WHEN HALSEY WAS CALLED TO THE TELEPHONE I CEASED ALL PRETENSE AT EATING
I AND MINE HAVE SUFFERED ENOUGH AT THE HANDS OF THIS FAMILY
THAT THEY GOT OFF AT THE NEXT STATION AND WALKED BACK AGAIN TO SUNNYSIDE AT DUSK WAS NOT KNOWN AT THE TIME
BEYOND JERKING HIS HAND AWAY INSTANTLY HE MADE NO MOVEMENT
THERE WAS PLENTY OF LIGHT--THE ELECTRIC PLANT DOWN IN THE VILLAGE SUPPLIED US--BUT THERE WERE LONG VISTAS OF POLISHED FLOOR AND MIRRORS WHICH REFLECTED US FROM UNEXPECTED CORNERS UNTIL I FELT SOME OF LIDDY'S FOOLISHNESS COMMUNICATE ITSELF TO ME
I HAVE GIVEN YOU ALL I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY MOTHER HAD SHE LIVED--MY LOVE MY TRUST
I THINK HE HATED HALSEY AND HE WOULD GET RID OF HIM IF HE COULD PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT
THAT SHE HAD NOT GONE TO BED AT ALL
ANYHOW WE HAVE NOW ONE VEILED LADY WHO WITH THE GHOSTLY INTRUDER OF FRIDAY NIGHT MAKES TWO ASSETS THAT I HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT IS MYSTIFYING I ADMITTED ALTHOUGH I CAN THINK OF ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION
AND YOU WERE AS SURE THEN HE DID NOT LEAVE THE DRAGON FLY JAMMED INTO THE SIDE OF A FREIGHT CAR BEFORE NO BUT HE LEFT IT FOR REPAIRS IN A BLACKSMITH SHOP A LONG DISTANCE FROM HERE
ALEX LEANED DOWN THE CHUTE AND EXAMINED THE LADDER CAREFULLY
ON THURSDAY MR HARTON THE ARMSTRONGS LEGAL ADVISER CALLED UP FROM TOWN
ONLY IN MY DREAMS HE SAID IT OVER AND OVER UNTIL HE SEEMED TO SHRIEK IT IN MY EARS
I WAS AGHAST
THE COUNTRY AFTER DARK OPPRESSES ME
THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITHOUT TURNING RETREATING FOOT BY FOOT FROM THE DREAD IN THE CORNER AND I DO NOT THINK HE BREATHED
SHE WAS GOING
THAT THEY HAD STOPPED WHEN SHE WENT IN AND SHE HAD FELT A GUST OF COLD DAMP AIR
I BEGAN TO BE VAGUELY UNEASY FOR THE FIRST TIME
SHE HAD WAITED IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM WITH MR BAILEY UNTIL THE AUTOMOBILE HAD BEEN READY
GERTRUDE SAID SHE HAD LOCKED THE EAST ENTRY
IT HARDLY SEEMED LIKE THE ACTION OF AN INNOCENT MAN--THIS AVOIDANCE OF DAYLIGHT AND OF HIS FIANCEE'S PEOPLE
GERTRUDE FINALLY GOT A TRAP FROM THE CASANOVA LIVERYMAN AND WE WENT OUT
THERE IS NO ONE BUT YOURSELF AND YOUR NIECE MY NEPHEW I HAD TO MOISTEN MY LIPS
MUST GO THERE AT ONCE MR HARTON I SAID TESTILY I AM NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND
IF HE HAD NOT AND IF DOCTOR WALKER WAS IN THE SECRET HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN HOW TO ENTER THE CHIMNEY ROOM
WHY WHAT WOULD HALSEY DO TO ME IF I EVEN VENTURED SUCH A THING
WHATEVER MAD PRANK TOOK THEM AWAY IT WOULD LOOK BETTER IF THEY WERE HERE
I THINK I SHALL GO UP TO THE CITY TO-NIGHT
I HAD LOST ALL SENSE OF DIRECTION
CHAPTER XVI IN THE EARLY MORNING I STOOD LOOKING AT THE EMPTY BED
IN A WORD SEVEN YEARS BEFORE LUCY HASWELL HAD MARRIED A YOUNG MAN WHOSE NAME WAS GIVEN AS AUBREY WALLACE
THOMAS CAME JUST INSIDE THE DOOR AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAD DROOPING HIS EYES UNDER THEIR SHAGGY GRAY BROWS FIXED ON MR JAMIESON
TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK MISS INNES I CAN NOT THINK OF ANY REASON WHATEVER FOR HIS COMING HERE AS HE DID
IN ANY CASE HOWEVER I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE BODY WAS HERE WHEN HE LEFT
FROM TENSE WATCHFULNESS TO RELIEF AND NOW AGAIN TO ABSOLUTE DESPAIR HER FACE WAS AN OPEN PAGE
THE PLAN HAD BEEN TO SEND LOUISE AWAY UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE FOR HER TO INTERFERE BUT SHE CAME BACK TO THE HOTEL AT C JUST AT THE WRONG TIME
I--I THINK HE'S IN BED MA'M GET HIM UP I SAID AND FOR GOODNESS SAKE OPEN THE DOOR THOMAS
I COULD HEAR THOMAS IN THE PANTRY ALTERNATELY WAILING FOR MR ARNOLD AS HE CALLED HIM AND CITING THE TOKENS THAT HAD PRECURSED THE MURDER
THE NEXT INSTANT A HAND MET MINE ON THE STAIR-RAIL
YOU BETTAH SIT DOWN SAH HE SAID
FIVE CHILDREN HASN'T SHE THAT'S IT LIDDY SAID SUDDENLY BURSTING INTO TEARS
MARY ANNE KNEW NOW AS WELL AS I DID THAT THE LADDER HAD NO BUSINESS TO BE THERE
AUNT RAY SHE WHISPERED
I GOT UP AND DREW FORWARD A CHAIR
LOUISE STOOD LOOKING AFTER THEM
GERTRUDE GAZED AT THE FACE IN A KIND OF FASCINATION
THERE IS AN AIR OF FINALITY ABOUT A GRAVE
ON DEPOSITS
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED
I HAVE THE CLIPPING SOMEWHERE BUT JUST NOW I CAN REMEMBER ONLY THE ESSENTIALS
CHAPTER XVII A HINT OF SCANDAL IN GIVING THE GIST OF WHAT HAPPENED AT THE INQUEST I HAVE ONLY ONE EXCUSE--TO RECALL TO THE READER THE EVENTS OF THE NIGHT OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG'S MURDER
ALEX HAD STEPPED BACK BUT I SAW HIM WATCHING HER CURIOUSLY
INDEED IT CAME NEAR ENOUGH TO BEING MY LAST ACQUAINTANCE WITH ANYTHING
HE WAS AT THE GREENWOOD COUNTRY CLUB ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND APPEARED UNLIKE HIMSELF
A NEAT MAID ANSWERED THE BELL BUT SHE STOOD SQUARELY IN THE DOORWAY AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PRESERVE ONE'S DIGNITY AND PASS HER
I USED IT AT NIGHT WHEN I WAS WATCHING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE THE DETECTIVE WAS SATISFIED
I MADE OUT A LIST OF QUESTIONS AND POSSIBLE ANSWERS BUT I SEEMED ONLY TO BE WORKING AROUND IN A CIRCLE
THE WOMAN WHO CLAIMS TO BE THE MOTHER OF LUCIEN WALLACE HAS NOT COME BACK
THERE WERE VOICES IN THE HALL AND GERTRUDE CAME RUNNING TOWARD ME
RATHER TALL VERY DARK SMOOTH-SHAVEN
RIGGS GRINNED SHEEPISHLY
I GAVE UP FINALLY AND WENT DOWN THE LADDER AGAIN GETTING IN THROUGH THE BALL-ROOM WINDOW WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED
BARBARA FITZHUGH IN EXTRAVAGANT MOURNING--SHE ALWAYS WENT INTO BLACK ON THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION BECAUSE IT WAS BECOMING--AND MR JARVIS THE MAN WHO HAD COME OVER FROM THE GREENWOOD CLUB THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER
FOR THAT WAS THE SITUATION AS IT DEVELOPED
THE PROMINENCE OF THE FAMILY ASSURED A STRENUOUS EFFORT TO FIND THE MURDERER AND IF WE HAD NOTHING WORSE TO LOOK FORWARD TO WE WERE SURE OF A DISTASTEFUL PUBLICITY
I DROVE FROM THE TRAIN TO THE CHARITY HOSPITAL AND WAS AT ONCE TAKEN TO A WARD
NOTHING THAT I KNOW COULD HELP YOU TO FIND HALSEY SHE SAID STUBBORNLY
MR JAMIESON DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR WORDS IMPLY
THEN THE DOCTOR'S QUIET TONE EVIDENTLY NOT ARGUING MERELY STATING SOMETHING
IF HE IS INNOCENT HE PROBABLY HASN'T A TENTH OF THAT AMOUNT IN THE WORLD
PERHAPS IN THE HOUSE COME RIGHT IN SHE SAID HOSPITABLY
HE TRIED TO LOOK ENCOURAGING WITHOUT SUCCESS
I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE NOTICED HER HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE FACT THAT SHE HAD BEEN HORRIBLY DISFIGURED BY SMALLPOX
SHE GOT UP AND DREW HERSELF TO HER SLENDER HEIGHT LOOKING DOWN AT ME WITH THE SCORN OF THE YOUNG AND POSITIVE
WE WENT OUT TO INSPECT THE PROPERTY AND IT SEEMED TO DESERVE ITS NAME
PLEASE TRY TO BE MORE EXPLICIT HE SAID
WHERE THE FLOOR SHOULD HAVE BEEN WAS BLACK VOID AND DARKNESS FROM WHICH CAME THE INDESCRIBABLE DAMP SMELL OF THE CELLARS
I HATE TO BE REMINDED OF UNPLEASANT THINGS AND I SNAPPED HER OFF
AND WHATEVER YOU HEAR ABOUT ME TRY TO THINK AS WELL OF ME AS YOU CAN
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT LOUISE WAS MARRYING DOCTOR WALKER TO KEEP THE SHAMEFUL SECRET FOR HER MOTHER'S SAKE
A DOOR CLOSED SOMEWHERE AND THE DOCTOR ENTERED FROM THE HALL OF THE HOUSE
SHE MAINTAINED THAT AS SHE ENTERED UNSEEN HANDS HAD BEEN DIGGING AT THE PLASTER
THERE USED TO BE COVINGTONS DOWN THE CREEK THE NAME WAS CARRINGTON I SAID AND THE SUBJECT LAPSED
I KNEW HE WAS CREEPING ON ME INCH BY INCH AND I COULD NOT TELL FROM WHERE
I'LL WAIT FOR WARNER IT'S KIND O CLOSE IN HERE MA'M HE SAID OBEYING GINGERLY AND DISCLOSING A COOL AND COMFORTABLE LOOKING INTERIOR
HE HAD RECEIVED AS A LEGACY FROM AN UNCLE A FEW SHARES OF STOCK IN THE TRADERS BANK AND NOW HIS JOY WAS TURNED TO BITTERNESS
THERE WAS A DEPTH OF GRIEF AND CONVICTION IN HER TONE THAT WAS WORSE THAN ANYTHING SHE COULD HAVE SAID
AND THE FIRST THING I KNEW AN IRON BAR THAT LONG FULLY TWO YARDS BY HER MEASURE SHOT THROUGH THAT HOLE AND TUMBLED ON THE BED
GO UP TO BED NOW
THE OUTER ENTRY DOOR IN THE EAST WING HAD BEEN UNFASTENED AND WAS OPEN ABOUT AN INCH
THOMAS WAS WIPING SILVER AND THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH TOBACCO SMOKE
WAS THE DETECTIVE RIGHT AND WERE THE BONDS AND MONEY FROM THE TRADERS BANK THERE
I BROUGHT MR JAMIESON UP TO SEE THE HOLE IN THE WALL DIRECTLY AFTER BREAKFAST
MR JAMIESON SMILED AT MY FACE
MISS GERTRUDE INNES GERTRUDE'S REPLIES WERE FULLY AS CONCISE AS HALSEY'S
AND I COULD HEAR HALSEY CREAKING CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE MAIN STAIRCASE
THAT WAS THAT AUBREY WALLACE SHOULD EDUCATE HIS BOY
I HAD GONE BERSERK I THINK
HALF-WAY HOWEVER HE STOPPED
BY THE TIME I HAD MADE THEM UNDERSTAND A COUPLE OF MINUTES HAD ELAPSED
IT WAS SATURDAY NIGHT
HE CAME TO BRING--SOMETHING HALSEY I CRIED YOU MUST TELL ME THE WHOLE TRUTH
THEN SHE SAT DOWN ON THE SIDE OF HER BED AND FEELING FAINT--SHE WAS SUBJECT TO SPELLS--("I TOLD YOU THAT WHEN I CAME DIDN'T I ROSIE YES'M INDEED SHE DID!")--SHE PUT HER HEAD DOWN ON HER PILLOW AND TOOK A NAP
IT WAS UNLOCKED AND OPENED ABOUT AN INCH
HE'S A SMART DARKY AND WITH HIS MOUTH SHUT AND HIS SHIRT-FRONT COVERED YOU COULDN'T SEE HIM A YARD OFF IN THE DARK HALSEY CONFERRED WITH ALEX AND THE RESULT IN AN HOUR WAS SAM
THE FLUSH WAS GOING AND THE PECULIAR GASPING BREATHING OF THE NIGHT BEFORE WAS NOW A COMFORTABLE AND EASY RESPIRATION
TO HER SURPRISE ARNOLD ALREADY KNEW THROUGH BAILEY THAT NIGHT THAT THINGS WERE NOT RIGHT
HER HUSBAND DIED YESTERDAY IN CALIFORNIA AND--WAIT I WILL READ YOU THE MESSAGE I KNEW WHAT WAS COMING AND I MADE UP MY MIND AT ONCE
WITH THE MURDER OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG HE OR IT ONLY SEEMED TO TAKE ON FRESH VIGOR
MOREOVER IF MR ARMSTRONG DIED INSOLVENT AS I BELIEVE WAS THE CASE HIS WIDOW OUGHT TO BE GLAD TO BE RID OF SO EXPENSIVE A PIECE OF PROPERTY THE LAWYER CLEARED HIS THROAT
I AM ENGAGED TO MARRY HIM SHE SAID SIMPLY
THAT WILL DO I FLATTER MYSELF THAT THE CORONER GOT LITTLE ENOUGH OUT OF ME
WHEN--MR INNES CALLED AND THEN RUSHED AT ME I--I WAS ALARMED AND FLUNG THE BLANKET AT HIM HALSEY WAS EXAMINING THE CUT ON HIS FOREHEAD IN A SMALL MIRROR ON THE WALL
GERTRUDE DREW ASIDE THE CURTAIN AND PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS
IN FACT MISS INNES I AM QUITE CERTAIN SHE DID NOT
THEN I KNEW I HAD BEEN RIGHT
BUT THAT NIGHT SHE REFUSED TO BRACE
MR TRAUTMAN WHO WAS A LARGE AND GENIAL GERMAN WAITED FOR A TIME WHISTLING UNDER HIS BREATH
THE ROADS WERE BAD BUT THE TREES WERE IN LEAF AND THERE WERE STILL TULIPS IN THE BORDERS AROUND THE HOUSE
THE BODY WAS STILL SOMEWHAT WARM AND RIGOR MORTIS HAD NOT SET IN
AS FOR MYSELF DURING THE WHOLE RECITAL I HAD BEEN PLUNGED INTO THE DEEPEST AMAZEMENT
IT SEEMED MORE LIKELY SOME ONE WHO SUSPECTED A SECRET AT THE LODGE
AT THAT TIME MY BROTHER DIED LEAVING ME HIS TWO CHILDREN
IT BEARS OUT THE STATEMENT THAT THE WOMAN WITH THE CHILD AND THE WOMAN WHO QUARRELED WITH ARMSTRONG ARE THE SAME
VERY WELL I SAID THEN I SHALL GO DOWN ALONE
AS I LOOKED A SMALL MAN PUT HIS LEG OVER THE SILL AND STEPPED INTO THE ROOM
PAST THE MAID'S WHITE-STRAPPED SHOULDER I COULD SEE A FAMILIAR THATCH OF GRAY HAIR AND IN A MOMENT I WAS FACE TO FACE WITH DOCTOR STEWART
THE ONES TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE SHEET WERE MUCH BETTER THAN THE TOP ONES
EITHER THE MANTEL OR THE ROOF I DECIDED AND AFTER A HALF-HOUR AT THE MANTEL PRODUCTIVE OF ABSOLUTELY NO RESULT I DECIDED TO TRY THE ROOF
THE REST OF THE STORY WE KNEW
YOU ARE TWO BIG BABIES SHE SAID SOOTHINGLY
I WAKENED EARLY IN SPITE OF MY FATIGUE AND LAY THERE THINKING
IF YOU CAME OUT FOR AIR YOU'D BETTER PUT ON YOUR OVERSHOES AND THEN I NOTICED THAT GERTRUDE WAS LIMPING--NOT MUCH BUT SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE HER PROGRESS VERY SLOW AND SEEMINGLY PAINFUL
A FIRE AND SHOOTING IN ONE NIGHT IS RATHER LIVELY FOR A QUIET PLACE LIKE THAT IT IS AS QUIET AS A BOILER-SHOP I REPLIED AS I TURNED TO GO
COME IN HALSEY AND THEN I TOOK MY SEWING AND WENT INTO THE BOUDOIR BEYOND TO PLAY PROPRIETY
I WENT TO THE FUNERAL BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE SURE HE WAS REALLY BURIED AND I LOOKED AT THE STEP OF THE SHAFT WHERE I HAD SAT THAT NIGHT AND WONDERED IF IT WAS ALL REAL
I BEG YOUR PARDON AUNT RAY BUT--THE FELLOW'S A LUNATIC TELL ME EVERYTHING WON'T YOU HALSEY I BEGGED
NOT EARLIER WAS NOT HIS APPARENT FRIENDLINESS A CHANGE FROM HIS FORMER ATTITUDE YES
NOT ONE OF THE SERVANTS WOULD GO INTO THAT WING AT NIGHT UNLESS DRIVEN BY DIRE NECESSITY
MY VOICE ALMOST REFUSED ME BUT I MANAGED TO GASP OUT GERTRUDE GOOD LORD A MAN'S VOICE EXCLAIMED JUST BESIDE ME
I UNDERSTAND HE IS GOING TO MARRY THIS YOUNG LADY YOU HAVE BEEN MISINFORMED I SAID STIFFLY
SOMETHING HAS BEEN WEARING YOUR SHOES
EVERY MORGUE WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES EVERY HOSPITAL HAD BEEN VISITED WITHOUT RESULT
LISTEN
IF HE WAS HURT WE FIND NO TRACE OF HIM
IN FACT I KNEW THAT HE HAD ONCE INVESTIGATED THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLOTHES CHUTE HANGING TO A ROPE WITH THIS IN VIEW
MISS INNES HE SAID TAKING OF HIS HAT DO YOU KNOW WHERE ALEX THE GARDENER IS WHY NO
THE FOOLS TO HAVE LEFT A WARNING LIKE THAT
HALSEY TRIED TO STOP WHOEVER IT WAS AND FELL
WHEN I STARTED EAST I HAD ONLY ONE IDEA--TO BE ALONE WITH MY THOUGHTS FOR A TIME TO BURY MYSELF HERE
MOST UNFORTUNATE--AND MYSTERIOUS
ARNOLD WAS A SON BY THE FIRST MARRIAGE
BUT BEFORE WE GO ON I WANT TO SAY THIS
NO NO NOT AT ALL HE SAID WITH FORCED CHEERFULNESS
AND NOW HE SAID QUIETLY HOW LONG ARE YOU AND I TO PLAY OUR LITTLE COMEDY MR BAILEY CHAPTER XXXIV THE ODDS AND ENDS OF DOCTOR WALKER'S SENSATIONAL ESCAPE THAT NIGHT TO SOUTH AMERICA OF THE RECOVERY OF OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND SECURITIES IN THE SAFE FROM THE CHIMNEY ROOM--THE PAPERS HAVE KEPT THE PUBLIC WELL INFORMED
AND SO SHE CAME EAST
ON THE SUIT-CASE BELONGING TO THE WOMAN WITH THE PITTED FACE
WHERE WAS THE MONEY
I COULD NOT ASK HER
LIDDY HAD A STIFF NECK THE NEXT MORNING FROM LOOKING BACK OVER HER SHOULDER AND SHE REFUSED TO GO TO BED
AND MOTIONING LIDDY TO LOOK AFTER GERTRUDE I LED THE WAY WITH A LAMP TO THE CARD-ROOM DOOR
I DON'T CHARGE FULL RATES BECAUSE BRINGIN EM UP ALL SUMMER AS I DO IT PAYS TO MAKE A SPECIAL PRICE
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE HE IS HALSEY I ASKED GRAVELY LEANING FORWARD HAVE YOU THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION WHO KILLED ARNOLD ARMSTRONG
ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY WHAT ESPECIALLY SINCE JACK BAILEY AND ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WERE NOTORIOUSLY BAD FRIENDS
THE NEX MORNIN I COME BACK ALONG THE PATH AN DOWN WHERE I DUN SEE THE MAN NIGHT BEFOH I PICKED UP THIS HERE THE OLD MAN HELD OUT A TINY OBJECT AND MR JAMIESON TOOK IT
WHERE DID--YOU--FIND IT SHE ASKED FINALLY WITH A DESPERATE EFFORT AT CALM
BUT BY NIGHT SHE HAD NOT BEEN FOUND
YOU MUST START WITH WHEN YOU WENT DOWN THE DRIVE WITH MY DISHES AND MY SILVER I INTERRUPTED BUT SEEING MORE SIGNS OF HYSTERIA I GAVE IN
YOU GET THAT FROM YOUR MOTHER
NEVER AFTER THAT NIGHT DID I PUT MY HEAD ON MY PILLOW WITH ANY ASSURANCE HOW LONG IT WOULD BE THERE
AND ACROSS THE VALLEY PERHAPS A COUPLE OF MILES AWAY WAS THE GREENWOOD CLUB HOUSE
HE STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF SLOWLY STILL WATCHING HER AND CAUGHT MY ARM
THEN SHE PUT OUT HER HANDS BLINDLY AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO FAINT
AFTER I LEFT HER I MADE A CIRCUIT OF THE BUILDING
PERHAPS THE VERY UNSOPHISTICATION THAT HAD CHARMED HIM IN VALLEY MILL JARRED ON HIM IN THE CITY
DRIVING HOME THAT AFTERNOON I SAW HER IN THE CLEAR SUNLIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVERAL DAYS AND I WAS STARTLED TO SEE HOW ILL SHE LOOKED
SHE SHOWED ME A BADLY SWOLLEN HAND WITH REDDISH STREAKS RUNNING TOWARD THE ELBOW
I WAS FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY HIM
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW OF IT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN IT CAME OUT IN THE CASANOVA WEEKLY LEDGER
HALSEY PLAYED GOLF AT THE COUNTRY CLUB DAY AFTER DAY AND AFTER LOUISE LEFT AS SHE DID THE FOLLOWING WEEK MR JAMIESON AND I WERE MUCH TOGETHER
MR CORONER HE SAID AT THE RISK OF TAKING UP VALUABLE TIME I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK OF AN INCIDENT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT THROW SOME LIGHT ON THIS MATTER THE AUDIENCE WAS ALERT AT ONCE
SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT THOMAS WAS DEAD AND I DID NOT TELL HER
UNDER ALL THIS THESE TWO SUDDEN DEATHS THIS BANK ROBBERY THE INVASIONS AT SUNNYSIDE AND HALSEY'S DISAPPEARANCE THERE IS SOME MYSTERY THAT MARK MY WORDS WILL COME OUT SOME DAY
UP THE DRIVE WHERE I HAD SEEN A MAN WATCHING THE LODGE AND WHERE LATER ROSIE HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED
WHEN SHE FOUND THE HAND ARNOLD HAD INJURED WAS GROWING WORSE SHE GAVE THE ADDRESS OF LUCIEN AT RICHFIELD TO THE OLD MAN AND ALMOST A HUNDRED DOLLARS
IT'S GOT SO I DUNNO WHAT TO DO AND IT'S BOUN TO COME OUT SOME TIME ER RUTHER HE THREW THE DOOR OPEN THEN AND I STEPPED INSIDE HALSEY CLOSE BEHIND
SHE CAME TO THE OFFICE LATE AND THE DOCTOR WAS OUT
I LIGHTED THE LIVING-ROOM AND WE WENT IN THERE
IT'S TOO LOW TO HAVE HIT ANYTHING BUT A LEG OR FOOT FROM THAT TIME ON I WATCHED EVERY PERSON I MET FOR A LIMP AND TO THIS DAY THE MAN WHO HALTS IN HIS WALK IS AN OBJECT OF SUSPICION TO ME
LIDDY GO RIGHT UP AND LAY OUT AUNTY'S NIGHT THINGS
THE OPENINGS ON EITHER SIDE AS I HAVE SAID SHOWED NOTHING BUT PERHAPS THREE FEET OF BRICK WALL
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE I SAID HESITATINGLY AT THE LAST
A SCRATCH OR TWO ON THE STAIRS AND HALF A CUFF-BUTTON
THE CHARITY HOSPITAL CALLED UP DOCTOR STEWART AND REPORTED THAT MRS WATSON WAS IN A CRITICAL CONDITION
GO DOWN AND SEE HIM I INSTRUCTED GERTRUDE
MR JAMIESON READ IT
WHEN WITH THE HELP OF THE DOCTOR WHO WAS A FATHERLY MAN WITH A FAMILY OF GIRLS AT HOME WE GOT HER TO THE HOUSE AND UP THE STAIRS INTO BED SHE DROPPED INTO A FEVERISH SLEEP WHICH LASTED UNTIL MORNING
FROM THE TABLE MY EYES TRAVELED AROUND THE ROOM AND STOPPED AT THE DOOR OF A CLOSET
MRS FITZHUGH SUBJECTED HER TO A CLOSE INSPECTION COMMENCING WITH HER HAT AND ENDING WITH HER SHOES
BUT THE FACE OF THE PSEUDO-GARDENER WAS VERY QUEER INDEED WHEN THAT NIGHT IN THE CARD-ROOM THE DETECTIVE TURNED TO HIM AND SAID
SHE WALKED ALL AROUND THE HOUSE FIRST LOOKING UP AT THE WINDOWS
AND SO THAT DAY I MERELY TOLD LIDDY TO SEND THE NEW APPLICANT IN
HE ACCUSED THE DOCTOR OF THE DECEPTION AND CROSSING THE LAWN HAD SAID SOMETHING CRUEL TO LOUISE
ONLY TWO PEOPLE MISSING FROM THE HOUSEHOLD ROSIE AND GERTRUDE
TWO DAYS BEFORE MR ARMSTRONG WAS SHOT I WAS SENT FOR TO GO TO THE COUNTRY CLUB
THEN IT WAS DECIDED THAT--THAT THEY SHOULD BOTH GO AWAY CAN'T YOU BE MORE EXPLICIT MR JAMIESON ASKED
AND JUST AROUND THE CORNER IN THE SMALL CORRIDOR WAS THE DOOR MR JAMIESON HAD INDICATED
DOCTOR WALKER I SAID I HAVE COME TO YOU TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS
IT'S ON MY COAT MA'M
HE WAS A TALL FELLOW PERHAPS THIRTY AND HE WORE A SMALL MUSTACHE
BUT GERTRUDE'S GRIEF WAS BEYOND ANY POWER OF MINE TO COMFORT
A MAN ISN'T WELL ONE DAY AND DEAD THE NEXT WITHOUT SOME REASON HOW PERFECTLY IT ALL SEEMED TO FIT
WHY DON'T YOU TRUST ME MISS INNES HE SAID
I FELT LIKE A RUIN MYSELF AS I PAUSED ON THE BROAD VERANDA BEFORE I ENTERED THE HOUSE
DO YOU KNOW IF HE HAD ANY ENEMIES
TO ME MR JAMIESON WAS FAR LESS FORMIDABLE UNDER MY EYES WHERE I KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING THAN HE WAS OF IN THE CITY TWISTING CIRCUMSTANCES AND MOTIVES TO SUIT HIMSELF AND LEARNING WHAT HE WISHED TO KNOW ABOUT EVENTS AT SUNNYSIDE IN SOME OCCULT WAY
BUT HE HELD OFF TOO LONG
NO ONE I THINK WAS VERY SORRY THAT ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS DEAD BUT THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH AROUSED SOME SYMPATHY AND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CURIOSITY
IF IT WAS SOME MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHO COULD IT HAVE BEEN
THE HOLE IN THE TRUNK-ROOM WALL STILL YAWNED THERE BETWEEN THE CHIMNEY AND THE OUTER WALL
BEULAH GAVE ME RATHER A START BY RUBBING UNEXPECTEDLY AGAINST MY FEET
ALEX WAS TOO MUCH ENGROSSED TO BE EITHER AND TO THIS DAY I DON'T THINK I EVER ASKED HIM WHY HE WENT OFF WITHOUT PERMISSION THE DAY BEFORE
THE DRIVER TOOK THEM WITH A FLOURISH TO THE SERVANTS ENTRANCE AND DROVE AROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE WHERE I WAS AWAITING HIM
YOU SUSPECT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CUFF-LINK BUT YOU WON'T TELL ME
GERTRUDE WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
ONCE HE ROUSED
WHY DIDN'T YOU TRUST ME AND SEND FOR ME BEFORE IT WAS BECAUSE I COULDN'T TRUST MYSELF SHE SAID IN A LOW TONE
THE TAIL LIGHTS WERE BURNING BUT THE HEADLIGHTS WERE OUT
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE
AND THEN--HE CAUGHT ME
PAUL ARMSTRONG RESTS IN CASANOVA CHURCHYARD AND THIS TIME THERE IS NO MISTAKE
THEN HE WAS GONE
AS A WEAPON OF EITHER OFFENSE OR DEFENSE IT WAS AN ABSURDITY UNLESS ONE ACCEPTED LIDDY'S HYPOTHESIS OF A GHOST AND EVEN THEN AS HALSEY POINTED OUT A BILLIARD-PLAYING GHOST WOULD BE A VERY MODERN EVOLUTION OF AN ANCIENT INSTITUTION
IN THE BEDROOM LOUISE WAS WATCHING FOR ME
THEY LEFT THE HOUSE AT A QUARTER BEFORE THREE HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT MR JAMIESON ASKED ODDLY
MY STEPFATHER PAYS OUT BILLS
HE OFFERED IT TO ME FOR THREE DOLLARS HOW DID YOU KNOW THE WATCH WINTERS SNAPPED AT HIM
R
THE POSITIONS BECAME REVERSED
HE HAD NOT LEFT THE VILLAGE AND HE HAD NOT CALLED IN A PHYSICIAN
HE HAD TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING HE HAD IN THE WORLD AND HIS FEELING AGAINST PAUL ARMSTRONG DEAD AS HE WAS MUST HAVE BEEN BITTER IN THE EXTREME
THAT'S CARELESS ENOUGH HE SAID
THE CHILDREN'S MONEY WAS GONE
I DO NOT TRUST DOCTOR WALKER
BUT LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THOSE DAYS THE BANK FAILURE WAS ALMOST FORGOTTEN BY GERTRUDE AND MYSELF
AGAIN--PERHAPS THE NIGHTLY VISITOR
IN BOTH ROOMS THE CHIMNEY FLUE EXTENDED WELL OUT FROM THE WALL
IT HAS BEEN VERY DEPLORABLE I HASTENED TO SET HIM RIGHT
SHE WANTED ME TO HUNT HIM AND WHEN HE DIDN'T APPEAR SHE CALLED HIM NAMES
BEFORE THE MURDER NO DOUBT BUT WHO WOULD BELIEVE THAT
WHEN THE BABIES CRIED OLD DOCTOR WAINWRIGHT GAVE THEM PEPPERMINT AND DROPPED WARM SWEET OIL IN THEIR EARS WITH SUBLIME FAITH THAT IF IT WAS NOT COLIC IT WAS EARACHE
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT WAS TRUE ENOUGH
I STOOD PERFECTLY STILL HARDLY DARING TO BREATHE
I WAKE YET AND FEEL MYSELF COLD AND TREMBLING WITH THE HORROR OF HALSEY'S SITUATION FOR THREE DAYS AFTER HIS DISAPPEARANCE
I CUT IN RUTHLESSLY
GERTRUDE AND JACK HAD RETURNED AND WERE THERE SITTING TOGETHER ON A DIVAN WITH ONLY ONE LAMP LIGHTED
MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT HE WAITED TO SEE MISS GERTRUDE BEFORE FLYING FROM THE COUNTRY
I READ OF HIS DEATH MONDAY EVENING FOR THE FIRST TIME MR BAILEY DID NOT SEE HIM ON HIS WAY ACROSS THE LAWN I THINK NOT
I LOOKED FOR FOOTPRINTS WHICH IS I BELIEVE THE CONVENTIONAL THING TO DO ALTHOUGH MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT AS CLUES BOTH FOOTPRINTS AND THUMB-MARKS ARE MORE USEFUL IN FICTION THAN IN FACT
I PUT OUT ONE HAND IN FRONT OF ME BUT I TOUCHED NOTHING
THEY LEAD YOU INTO BOTTOMLESS PITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
HE SAT DOWN ON THE CENTER-TABLE WITH HIS HANDS THRUST IN HIS POCKETS AND WATCHED ME AS I FOLLOWED THOMAS UP THE NARROW STAIRS
SO BROKEN AND HALF-COHERENT HOWEVER WAS HER STORY THAT I SHALL TELL IT IN MY OWN WAY
NOW MISS INNES YOU HAD NO SUCH VISITOR I BELIEVE NONE I SAID DECIDEDLY
FIRST I WANT TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS
MR JAMIESON LEFT TAKING A SHORT CUT TO THE VILLAGE AND I STILL STOOD THERE
I DID NOT GO TO SLEEP AT ONCE
AS I WENT UP-STAIRS THOMAS PUT DOWN THE PAPER AND TAKING HIS PIPE WENT OUT ON THE PORCH
IT MAY NOT AMOUNT TO ANYTHING HE SAID SLOWLY
HE WAS POLITELY FIRM BUT HE WOULD COME OVER EARLY THE NEXT MORNING AND IF I GAVE HIM A KEY HE WOULD COME IN TIME TO GET SOME SORT OF BREAKFAST
NO THOMAS CAME BOWING AND SHOWING HIS WHITE TEETH THROUGH THE DARKNESS
THERE WAS NO KEY ON THE DEAD MAN OR IN THE DOOR
THE TRADERS BANK CLOSES ITS DOORS WAS WHAT I READ AND THEN I PUT DOWN THE PAPER AND LOOKED ACROSS THE TABLE
WHO KNOWS?--THIS MAY BE A SCHEME TO DRAW EVERYBODY AWAY FROM THIS END OF THE HOUSE AND LET SOME ONE IN HERE THE INSTANT I HAD SAID IT I WAS CONVINCED I HAD HIT ON THE EXPLANATION AND THAT PERHAPS IT WAS ALREADY TOO LATE
AND SOON WE WERE IN THE LITTLE SHABBY PARLOR EXACTLY LIKE A THOUSAND OF ITS PROTOTYPES
I CONFESS MYSELF THAT THE PLACE SEEMED TO ME TO HAVE A SINISTER APPEARANCE BUT WE KEPT THAT WING WELL LIGHTED AND UNTIL THE LIGHTS WENT OUT AT MIDNIGHT IT WAS REALLY CHEERFUL IF ONE DID NOT KNOW ITS HISTORY
WALTER P
POSSIBLY HE SAID QUIETLY AS WE HURRIED TOGETHER UP THE STAIRS
UGH GERTRUDE SAID WHEN WE HAD PASSED WHAT A FACE
I MEASURED WITH THE TAPE-LINE MY HANDS TREMBLING SO THAT I COULD SCARCELY HOLD IT
NO ANSWER
THE POLICE STEP IN LATER
WE DISPERSED FINALLY TO BATHE AND DRESS LEAVING LOUISE LITTLE THE WORSE FOR HER EXPERIENCE
THAT NIGHT THE SUNNYSIDE GHOST BEGAN TO WALK AGAIN
CHAPTER XXVIII A TRAMP AND THE TOOTHACHE THE BITTERNESS TOWARD THE DEAD PRESIDENT OF THE TRADERS BANK SEEMED TO GROW WITH TIME
A WOMAN WHO WISHED TO REACH THE COUNTRY CLUB UNPERCEIVED MIGHT CHOOSE SUCH A METHOD
HARDLY ABLE TO STAND I CREPT BACK TO MY ROOM
INSTEAD OF AN ANSWER WHOEVER IT WAS TURNED AND RAN UP
HE WAS A BEAUTIFUL CHILD AND ALTHOUGH HE SHOWED TRACES OF RECENT SEVERE ILLNESS HIS SKIN HAD NOW THE CLEAR TRANSPARENCY OF HEALTH
I MOVED UP THE STAIRS UNTIL I COULD SEE INTO THE CARD-ROOM OR RATHER THROUGH IT TO THE WINDOW
JUST NOW HOWEVER THERE WERE MANY THINGS TO BE ATTENDED TO AND LEAVING WARNER WITH THE BODY WE ALL WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE
WHEN YOU SLEEP IN A CHAIR YOU SNORE SHE WAS TOO FAR GONE TO BE INDIGNANT BUT AFTER A WHILE SHE CAME TO THE DOOR AND LOOKED IN TO WHERE I WAS COMPOSING MYSELF FOR SLEEP WITH DRUMMOND'S SPIRITUAL LIFE
YOU HAVE TAKEN ME ON FAITH AND--YOU HAVE NOT ASKED ME ANY QUESTIONS
THE STABLE BEING ON A HILL WAS A TORCH TO ATTRACT THE POPULATION FROM EVERY DIRECTION
JUST INSIDE HE WAS SHOT BY SOME ONE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
THEN--HE TOUCHED MY HAND COLD CLAMMY DEATH-LIKE
THAT IS THE CHILD STEWART SPOKE OF AT THE INQUEST WARNER WITH HIS MECHANIC'S INSTINCT HAD REACHED FOR THE KEY
REAL EGGS HE SAID PROUDLY
IT WAS VERY MUCH OF A DISAPPOINTMENT
BEHIND THE MANTEL
AND THEN--I HEARD SOUNDS FROM BELOW ME IN THE HOUSE
I COULD HEAR IT STRIKE ON SOMETHING WITH A SHARP METALLIC SOUND BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TELL HOW FAR IT HAD GONE
HE--HE OUGHT TO BE HERE I HURRIED ON DOWN THE DRIVE
IT LOOKED LIKE TYPHOID AND THE MOTHER WAS FRANTIC
LIDDY WAS WAITING TO TELL ME THAT THE NEW COOK HAD GONE BAG AND BAGGAGE WITHOUT WAITING TO BE PAID
I WALKED ALONG WITH THE WATER SLOSHING IN MY BOOTS AND I WAS ACTUALLY CHEERFUL
WHEN ANNE THE ELDER WAS THIRTY-TWO AND LUCY WAS NINETEEN A YOUNG MAN HAD COME TO THE TOWN
THIS ONE AS I SAID BEFORE IS PUZZLING THE SECOND SCRAP FOLDED AND REFOLDED INTO A COMPASS SO TINY THAT THE WRITING HAD BEEN PARTLY OBLITERATED WAS PART OF A LETTER--THE LOWER HALF OF A SHEET NOT TYPED BUT WRITTEN IN A CRAMPED HAND
WELL WE DID NOT GO BACK TO TOWN THAT DAY
DROP BY DROP THE LIQUOR HAD COOKED THE EGG AND NOW WITH A FINAL WHISK A LAST TOSS IN THE SHAKER IT WAS READY A SYMPHONY IN GOLD AND WHITE
BAILEY HAD STARTED FOR HERE AND THE MESSENGER HAD GONE BACK TO THE CITY
THE BONDS WERE A PART OF THE MISSING TRACTION BONDS FROM THE TRADERS BANK
A VEILED LADY HE PERSISTED WHO WAS APPARENTLY YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL ENGAGED HIS HACK AND ASKED TO BE DRIVEN TO SUNNYSIDE
I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD I SAID DRYLY THAT UNDERTAKERS ASSISTANTS ARE JOVIAL YOUNG MEN
AS FOR ME I HAD A GENEROUS GLOW THAT WAS CHEAP AT THE PRICE OF A CHURCH CARPET
DON'T MAKE ME LEAVE NOW YOU ARE LOSING YOUR HEALTH AND YOUR GOOD LOOKS I SAID DECIDEDLY
SHE STOOD SOMEWHAT AWKWARDLY JUST INSIDE THE DOOR AND SHE HAD AN AIR OF SELF-CONFIDENCE THAT WAS INSPIRING
IT WAS LATE WHEN MR JAMIESON FINALLY GOT UP TO GO
AND HER GHASTLY ATTEMPT AT A GRIN WITH HER SWOLLEN NOSE AND RED EYES MADE ME HYSTERICAL
BUT THINGS WENT SO FAST THERE WAS NO TIME TO CARRY IT INTO EFFECT
BUT I AM NOT EASILY ALARMED
WHEN YOU ARE BETTER I AM GOING TO SCOLD YOU FOR NOT COMING HERE AT ONCE
GERTRUDE
MR ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS AT THE GREENWOOD CLUB AND AT LAST THOMAS NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO DO WENT OVER THERE ALONG THE PATH
AT HALF-PAST NINE I HEARD THE SOUND OF A HORSE DRIVEN FURIOUSLY UP THE DRIVE
IN AN HOUR FROM THE TIME I ENTERED THE CHARITY HOSPITAL I HAD HEARD A SAD AND PITIFUL NARRATIVE AND HAD SEEN A WOMAN SLIP INTO THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS THAT IS ONLY A STEP FROM DEATH
THE NEXT ROOM BUT THE SOUND OF BLOWS ON THE MANTEL DROWNED MY VOICE
BUT I HAD NOT TIME TO LISTEN TO SOME PERSON PROBABLY DISPUTING HIS BILL SO I COUGHED
THE TRAMP CLEARED HIS THROAT
WHEN WE GET THIS CLEARED UP I AM GOING BACK TO THE CITY TO BE QUIET
HALSEY KNOWS NOTHING OF THIS THING AND NO AMOUNT OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE CAN MAKE AN INNOCENT MAN GUILTY SIT DOWN HE SAID PUSHING FORWARD A CHAIR
WHILE HALSEY LOOKING STRICKEN AND WHITE WAS TRYING TO SMOOTH IT OUT AND READ IT GERTRUDE HAD DROPPED HER HEAD ON THE TABLE AND WAS SOBBING STORMILY
THE NEAREST APPROACH TO IT WAS AN OLD FELLOW WHO TENDED THE SAFETY GATES AT THE RAILROAD AND HE I LEARNED ON INQUIRY HAD TWO ARTIFICIAL LEGS
THIS THEY DID AS I HAVE TOLD
BUT THE MAN WHO DRIVES THE HACK DOWN THERE TELLS A STORY THAT MAY POSSIBLY PROVE TO BE IMPORTANT I HAVE HEARD IT I THINK
I AM NOT GOING DOWN THERE SHE SAID FIRMLY
LIDDY BROUGHT ME SOME TEA WHILE I RESTED AFTER MY TRIP AND ON THE TRAY WAS A SMALL BOOK FROM THE CASANOVA LIBRARY
AND I HAD THOUGHT HE WAS ILL
THEN THERE WAS A DIATRIBE ON THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN OCCURRENCE
SHE WROTE ME THAT HER PEOPLE WERE OPPOSED TO THE MARRIAGE
ANNE WAS FRANTIC
I THOUGHT HE HAD COME BACK TO SEE ME--I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THE TIME FOR HIS HOURS WERE ALWAYS ERRATIC
IN TWO OR THREE PLACES IN THE WALL SMALL APERTURES HAD BEEN MADE NONE OF THEM OF ANY DEPTH
WHAT HAD THOMAS KNOWN AND MRS WATSON
THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS SHE COULD NOT BE TOLD IN HER WEAKENED CONDITION THAT I DREADED THE INTERVIEW
BUT WHEN HALSEY HAD FINISHED HIS ELECTRICAL COURSE AND GERTRUDE HER BOARDING-SCHOOL AND BOTH CAME HOME TO STAY THINGS WERE SUDDENLY CHANGED
NINA CARRINGTON CAME FROM THE TOWN IN CALIFORNIA WHERE MR ARMSTRONG DIED
THERE ARE SOME THINGS I HAVE TO TELL YOU AND IN RETURN PLEASE TELL ME ALL YOU KNOW
BUT I SAID NOTHING MORE ABOUT SENDING HER TO SCOTLAND
NO--THAT ISN'T LIKE YOU LOUISE
UNLESS THE PERSON WHO DRILLED THE HOLE CARRIED HIS EYES ON THE ENDS OF A STICK ELIZA COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE SEEN THEM BUT THE FACT REMAINED AND A VISIT TO ELIZA'S ROOM PROVED IT
IS THERE ANYTHING NEW I ASKED ANXIOUSLY
WOULD WE FIND A BODY OR SOME ONE BADLY INJURED
WE WERE THE CENTER OF ACTION
DON'T ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS MISS INNES
HALSEY I DID NOT THROW YOUR REVOLVER INTO THE TULIP BED
DOCTOR I ASKED IS THERE ANY ONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD NAMED CARRINGTON
EVERY TIME I SEE A WAY FOR YOU TO ESCAPE YOU BLOCK IT YOURSELF WITH THIS WALL OF MYSTERY
WHERE IS LOUISE SHE IS NOT IN HER ROOM I SAID STUPIDLY
GEIST THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A MAID AS YOU HAD GOT A SUPPLY THAT DAY
HALSEY DROPPED INTO A CHAIR IN THE LIVING-ROOM AND STARED MOODILY AHEAD
TO SAY LINGERIE FOR UNDER-GARMENTS FROCKS AND GOWNS INSTEAD OF DRESSES AND THAT BEARDLESS SOPHOMORES ARE NOT COLLEGE BOYS BUT COLLEGE MEN
I WENT WITH HIM TO THE DOOR AND TOGETHER WE STOOD LOOKING OUT OVER THE VALLEY
HE SEEMED TO HAVE A GOOD MOUTH AND WHEN HE SMILED HIS TEETH WERE ABOVE THE AVERAGE
GOING TO BUILD THAT HOUSE AT ROCK VIEW IT WAS A TWENTY-YEAR-OLD JOKE OF HIS
AND TO ADD TO THE SIMILARITY JUST THEN THE HALL CLOCK FAR OFF STRUCK FAINTLY THREE O'CLOCK
CHAPTER IV WHERE IS HALSEY
I MISS HIM SORELY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SAID FRANTICALLY
I LISTENED AND HEARING NOTHING OPENED THE DOOR A LITTLE AND PEERED INTO THE HALL
YOU SEND BAILEY OFF WITH AN EMPTY GUN AND THROW MINE IN A TULIP BED OF ALL PLACES ON EARTH
THE SLIP HAD SAID CHIMNEY IT WAS THE ONLY CLUE AND A HOUSE AS LARGE AS SUNNYSIDE WAS FULL OF THEM
BAILEY'S FLIGHT LOOKS BAD TOO AND YOU THINK HALSEY HELPED HIM TO ESCAPE UNDOUBTEDLY
BUT I KNOW THIS
THEY HAD ONE TRIUMPH THAT THEY ATE REGULARLY FOR BREAKFAST AND THAT CLUNG TO THEIR CLOTHES AND THEIR HAIR THE REST OF THE DAY
WHAT ALL-POWERFUL REASON MADE LOUISE DETERMINE TO MARRY DOCTOR WALKER
AND THE SECOND REASON HE PURSUED WAS THAT THE ARMSTRONGS WOULD HAVE NONE OF ME I SAT BOLT UPRIGHT AT THAT AND GASPED
HIS RECOVERY WAS DESTINED TO BE ALMOST AS SUDDEN AS HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND WAS DUE DIRECTLY TO THE TRAMP ALEX HAD BROUGHT TO SUNNYSIDE
IS EVERYTHING--RIGHT SHE ASKED
THE FIRST WARNING I HAD WAS A STEALTHY FUMBLING AT THE LOCK OF THE MANTEL-DOOR
I THINK IT PROBABLE HE SAID THAT OUR VISITOR WILL BE BACK AGAIN AND THE THING TO DO IS TO LEAVE THINGS EXACTLY AS THEY ARE TO AVOID ROUSING SUSPICION
ANNE HAD HAD NO CHILDREN OF HER OWN AND ON LUCIEN SHE HAD LAVISHED ALL HER ABORTED MATERNAL INSTINCT
NEITHER ONE HAD BEEN MORE THAN LIGHTED THEN PUT DOWN AND FORGOTTEN
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WHILE YOU AND MISS GERTRUDE WERE OUT DRIVING I HAD GOT THE CAR IN SOME SORT OF SHAPE AGAIN AFTER THE FIRE AND I WENT TO THE LIBRARY TO CALL MR INNES TO SEE IT
I SPOKE
GERTRUDE HAD NOT COME DOWN AND THERE WAS NO NEWS OF HALSEY
THE DISCOVERY OF A SMALL PICTURE FALLEN FROM THE WALL OF THE DRAWING-ROOM WAS QUITE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY LIDDY THAT THE ALARM HAD BEEN A FALSE ONE BUT I WAS ANYTHING BUT CONVINCED
DID YOU HAVE TWO CUPS OF COFFEE AT YOUR DINNER I INQUIRED
NOW DON'T BE RIDICULOUS
HE LOOKED DAGGERS AT ME
THEN I TURNED AND WENT OUT
I WAS A BIT NERVOUS AND I PUT MY HAND ON HALSEY'S SLEEVE
THEY HAVE SO MUCH THAT IS BEAUTIFUL AND BEAUTY IS ENNOBLING
A WOMAN OF YOUR AGE WHO WOULD RATHER GO AROUND WITH AN EXPOSED NERVE IN HER HEAD THAN HAVE THE TOOTH PULLED
THEN IT'S ALL OVER HE WAS SAYING WITH A LONG BREATH
NOTHING
SHE HELD OUT HER HAND AND I TOOK IT BETWEEN BOTH OF MINE
GERTRUDE HAD NEVER BEEN EVEN ORDINARILY COURTEOUS TO HIM AND SHE NODDED COLDLY
ALEX HOWEVER WAS NOT TO BE FOUND
FIRST SHE KEPT ME AWAKE BY SILLY ALARMS THEN WHEN SHE WAS NEEDED SHE SLEPT LIKE JOE JEFFERSON OR RIP,--THEY ARE ALWAYS THE SAME TO ME
WHICH WAS TRUE ENOUGH NO DOUBT
BUT I GOT HER OVER TO MY ROOM AT LAST MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE AND MADE HER LIE DOWN ON THE BED
NOW TELL ME ABOUT IT HE SAID
HOW THE INTRUDER HAD ESCAPED WITH EVERYTHING LOCKED AND WHY HE HAD LEFT THE SMALL SILVER WHICH IN THE ABSENCE OF A BUTLER HAD REMAINED DOWN-STAIRS OVER NIGHT
I KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT BOXES OF ROSES THAN BUSHES OF THEM THIS MAN POINTING TO THE ASSISTANT SAYS ALEX ISN'T A GARDENER
LOUISE WAS WITH HER MOTHER IN TOWN AND BEYOND A POLITE NOTE OF THANKS TO ME WE HAD HEARD NOTHING FROM HER
AFTER I'D GONE ON A PIECE I LOOKED BACK AND HE WAS HOBBLING ON AND--EXCUSE ME MISS--HE WAS SWEARING SOMETHING SICKENING DID THEY GO TOWARD THE CLUB GERTRUDE ASKED SUDDENLY LEANING FORWARD
THE LADDER IN THE CHUTE THE BURNING OF THE STABLE AND THE ENTRANCE THROUGH THE CARD-ROOM WINDOW--ALL WERE IN THE COURSE OF A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO GET INTO THE CHIMNEY-ROOM
THEN SHE POINTED SILENTLY TO THE DOORWAY INTO THE HALL BEYOND
MY NEIGHBORS ARE PACKING UP FOR ANOTHER SUMMER
ON ONE THING SHE WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER
MR JAMIESON THE DETECTIVE SAID HIMSELF HE COULD NEVER HAVE DONE WITHOUT ME ALTHOUGH HE GAVE ME LITTLE ENOUGH CREDIT IN PRINT
WE WERE ALMOST AT RICHFIELD NOW SO I KEPT ON
IF YOU DON'T I'LL SIT IN THE HALL OUTSIDE THE DOOR
HE WAITED FOR TEN MINUTES OR SO
PURSUED SHE HAD FLED MADLY ANYWHERE--THROUGH THE FIRST DOOR SHE CAME TO
AT TWELVE-THIRTY O'CLOCK THE SATURDAY BEFORE AS SOON AS THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY WAS CLOSED MR JOHN BAILEY THE CASHIER OF THE DEFUNCT BANK HAD TAKEN HIS HAT AND DEPARTED
JUST AS WE TURNED FROM THE DRIVE INTO THE ROAD WE PASSED A WOMAN
I SCRAPED THE EARTH OFF IT WITH THE TIP OF MY SHOE AND PICKING IT UP SLIPPED IT INTO MY POCKET
THEN I SAT DOWN AND LOOKED AT THE COALPORT PLATE AND THE SILVER SPOON
THAT WASN'T A WOMAN MISS RACHEL SHE SAID WITH HER SHOES IN HER HAND
I BELIEVE I COULD FIND YOUR BROTHER AND I MIGHT BE ABLE TO--WELL TO DO SOME OTHER THINGS BUT GERTRUDE'S GLANCE DID NOT FALTER
I WAS ASKIN DID YOU WANT THE LADDER LEFT UP THE CLOTHES CHUTE THE WHAT I SCREECHED AND WAS SORRY THE NEXT MINUTE
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING UNUSUAL THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HAD WE NOT OURSELVES HEARD THE RAPPING NOISES I SHOULD HAVE FELT THAT LOUISE'S IMAGINATION HAD RUN AWAY WITH HER
THERE WAS MURDER BEING DONE AND SHE WOULD SEE HIM SWING FOR IT
ON THE WAY ACROSS THE LAWN SHE WAS CONFRONTED BY ARNOLD WHO FOR SOME REASON WAS DETERMINED TO GET INTO THE HOUSE
WHAT DID THOMAS SEE IN THE SHADOWS THE NIGHT HE DIED
MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP-STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TONIGHT I HAVE NONE I SAID HAPPILY
PIPE-SMOKING OBSEQUIOUS NOT OVER RELIABLE KINDLY OLD MAN
IT IS MARKED N
THE HOLE SHOWED ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE CHIMNEY AND I DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE WHAT LAY IN THE SPACE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MANTEL
THERE WAS A RUMOR IN THE VILLAGE BROUGHT UP BY LIDDY FROM THE BUTCHER'S THAT A WEDDING HAD ALREADY TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN LOUISE AND DOCTOR WALKERS AND THIS ROUSED ME FOR THE FIRST TIME TO ACTION
SHE TALKED TO HIM FOR A LONG TIME AND INDEED SHE LOOKED MUCH HAPPIER WHEN SHE LEFT YOU ARE SURE THIS WAS NOT THE REAL MOTHER O MERCY NO
I HAVE THE FEELING THAT WE THREE OUTSIDERS WHO HAVE PAID OUR MONEY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF STAYING IN THIS SPOOK-FACTORY ARE LIVING ON THE VERY TOP OF THINGS
COULD THIS VEILED WOMAN BE THE NINA CARRINGTON OF THE MESSAGE
THE DAY THAT THE MURDERER IS DISCOVERED I WILL LEAVE THEN JUDGING BY WHAT I HAVE HEARD YOU WILL BE BACK IN THE CITY VERY SOON HE SAID
WHEN THAT GREW MONOTONOUS AND RATHER PAINFUL I GOT UP AND ACCORDING TO THE TIME-HONORED RULE FOR PEOPLE SHUT IN UNKNOWN AND INK-BLACK PRISONS I FELT MY WAY AROUND--IT WAS SMALL ENOUGH GOODNESS KNOWS
HE CAUGHT AT THE BASKET AND I DROPPED IT
AH WELL DOCTOR WAINWRIGHT IS GONE AND I AM AN ELDERLY WOMAN WITH AN INCREASING TENDENCY TO LIVE IN THE PAST
WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFICULTY THE DOOR OPENED REVEALING THE BLACKNESS OF THE DRYING-ROOM BEYOND
THEN HE TURNED NOT TOWARD ME BUT TOWARD THE BILLIARD-ROOM DOOR
HER NAME WAS ANNE WATSON AND I DINED THAT EVENING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE DAYS
THERE WAS A PECULIAR THROBBING VIBRATING NOISE THAT I FELT RATHER THAN HEARD MUCH LIKE THE PULSING BEAT OF FIRE ENGINES IN THE CITY
AS TO WHERE WE WENT IF I HAVE TO DEPEND ON THAT AS AN ALIBI I SHALL NOT TELL
FIRE HE YELLED
LIDDY I CALLED GO THROUGH THE HOUSE AT ONCE AND SEE WHO IS MISSING OR IF ANY ONE IS
BUT IT WAS NOT THE TELEPHONE
HE GOT A PIECE OF CANDLE AND BY ENLARGING THE APERTURE A LITTLE WAS ABLE TO EXAMINE WHAT LAY BEYOND
THEN HALSEY WAS CALLED
AND WHERE WAS PAUL ARMSTRONG
HOW IS MISS ARMSTRONG SHE--SHE IS DOING VERY WELL I STAMMERED
I WATCHED GERTRUDE'S BRIGHT COLOR SLOWLY EBBING AWAY AND AROUND MY OWN HEART I SEEMED TO FEEL THE GRASP OF A GIANT HAND
AND HURRY I PUT THE CANDLE ON THE FLOOR AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE AND TOOK OFF MY BEDROOM SLIPPERS
THE HOUSE WAS QUIET AGAIN WEDNESDAY NIGHT
LOUISE
THEN I TURNED AND BEAT FURIOUSLY AT THE DOOR WITH MY FISTS
I GOT QUITE A LITTLE OF THE LATTER ON ME AS I CLIMBED FROM THE UNFINISHED BALL-ROOM OUT THROUGH A WINDOW TO THE ROOF OF THE EAST WING OF THE BUILDING WHICH WAS ONLY TWO STORIES IN HEIGHT
SUPPOSE LOUISE GREW WORSE
YOU MISSED ME BY AN INCH AND THEN I COLLAPSED AND FAINTED
HE CAME QUICKLY DOWN THE HALL TO WHERE WE WERE STANDING
GET UP FLINDERS FLINDERS I ASKED
THEY FORCED DOWN THE LADDER AT LAST AND PUT A NEW BOLT ON THE DOOR
I WENT UP-STAIRS TO HALSEY'S ROOM FINALLY FROM SHEER INABILITY TO SIT ACROSS FROM GERTRUDE ANY LONGER AND MEET HER TERROR-FILLED EYES
IN CERTAIN WALKS OF LIFE THE TEA-POT IS THE REFUGE IN TIMES OF STRESS TROUBLE OR SICKNESS
I THINK I LOOKED IT
IT WAS CALLED THE UNSEEN WORLD AND HAD A CHEERFUL COVER ON WHICH A HALF-DOZEN SHEETED FIGURES LINKED HANDS AROUND A HEADSTONE
I WATCHED HER COVERTLY DURING THE REST OF THE DRIVE AND I DID NOT LIKE THE TWO SPOTS OF CRIMSON IN HER PALE CHEEKS
WE HAD IT THEN SHO NUFF AND IT ENDED UP WITH MIS WATSON STAYIN IN THE LODGE NIGHTS AN ME LOOKIN FER WORK AT DE CLUB DID MRS WATSON SAY THAT ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED TO ALARM HER NO SAH
I DIDN'T WAIT TILL THE FIRE COMPANY LEFT
I GAVE HIM ONE I HAVE HAD FOR A YEAR OR TWO
TWO PRIVATE DETECTIVES HAD ARRIVED IN MY ABSENCE AND IT WAS A RELIEF TO TURN OVER TO THEM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HOUSE AND GROUNDS
SHE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE MEN EXAMINING THE HOUSE AFTER THE FIRE THE NIGHT BEFORE BUT SHE LOOKED IN THE TRUNK-ROOM AND SAW NOBODY
I SENT HIM HOME IN THE CAR WITH A BUNCH OF HOT-HOUSE ROSES FOR HIS WIFE AND HE WAS QUITE OVERWHELMED
SHE DROPPED BESIDE THE TABLE AND BURYING HER FACE IN HER ARMS BROKE INTO A STORM OF TEARS
BUT MR JAMIESON WAS NOT QUITE THROUGH QUESTIONING HIM
SHE HAD NOT KNOWN THAT SUNNYSIDE WAS RENTED AND WHATEVER HER TROUBLE WAS THIS COMPLICATED THINGS
MR JAMIESON WALKED WITH ME WHILE HALSEY AND GERTRUDE FOLLOWED
THE ARTICLE CLOSED BY SAYING THAT WHILE THE OFFICERS OF THE BANK REFUSED TO TALK UNTIL THE EXAMINER HAD FINISHED HIS WORK IT WAS KNOWN THAT SECURITIES AGGREGATING A MILLION AND A QUARTER WERE MISSING
HE FADED AWAY--THIS IS NOT SLANG
WE MUST NOT SHE SAID BROKENLY
THAT NIGHT AS GENTLY AS I COULD I TOLD LOUISE THE STORY OF HER STEPBROTHER'S DEATH
ONE WAS THAT YOU HAD A GIRL ALREADY PICKED OUT FOR ME NONSENSE I BROKE IN AND FELT MYSELF GROWING RED
NOT UNTIL I HAD GOT INTO MY BEDROOM AND DOUBLE-LOCKED THE DOOR DID I VENTURE TO TAKE IT OUT AND EXAMINE IT
THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED AT THREE
LOVELY PLACE THIS VILLAGE MUST BE IN THE WINTER HE SAID IRRELEVANTLY
THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT IS THERE
AS FOR MYSELF I SAT AND WONDERED IF I HAD A DEADLY ENEMY INTENT ON MY DESTRUCTION
COME OUT HE SAID QUIETLY
AUNT RAY THERE WAS NO SUCH MESSAGE
BUT I MYSELF WAS FAR FROM SATISFIED
GOOD FOR YOU HE APPLAUDED
WARNER SWORE THE FIRE WAS INCENDIARY AND IN VIEW OF THE ATTEMPT TO ENTER THE HOUSE THERE SEEMED TO BE NO DOUBT OF IT
BUT I HAD NOT KNOWN OF THIS KEY AND IT OPENED UP A NEW FIELD OF CONJECTURE
THEN I CAN WATCH FOR AT LEAST A PART OF EACH NIGHT AND PROBABLY MR INNES WILL HELP US OUT
IT WAS THE INTENTION NOT TO DRIVE INTRUDERS AWAY BUT TO CAPTURE THEM
THE SUGAR PLEASE THE EGG-NOG WAS FINISHED
THE COVERINGS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND LOUISE'S PINK SILK DRESSING-GOWN WAS GONE FROM THE FOOT WHERE IT HAD LAIN
THERE WAS A TERRIBLE SCENE
EVERY DROP OF BLOOD IN MY BODY SEEMED TO LEAVE THE SURFACE AND GATHER AROUND MY HEART
I HAVE FASTENED SOMEBODY IN THE SMALL ROOM AT THE HEAD OF THE CARD-ROOM STAIRS I JUMPED
MR BAILEY WAS STILL ILL AT THE KNICKERBOCKER AND IN THIS AS IN OTHER WAYS GERTRUDE'S CONDUCT PUZZLED ME
I BELIEVE IF YOU WOULD YOU COULD HELP US AND THAT LEADS TO ONE OF MY QUESTIONS
THAT THERE WAS A MEANS OF ENTRANCE AND PROBABLY A SIMPLE ONE I COULD BE CERTAIN
IF MR BAILEY CAME HERE THAT FRIDAY NIGHT EXPECTING TO MEET ARNOLD ARMSTRONG AND MISSED HIM--IF AS I SAY HE HAD DONE THIS MIGHT HE NOT SEEING HIM ENTER THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HAVE STRUCK HIM DOWN AS HE HAD INTENDED BEFORE BUT THE MOTIVE I GASPED
DID YOU KNOW MRS ARMSTRONG AND LOUISE ARE IN THE VILLAGE SHE CALLED
AND IN THE TRUNK-ROOM AS LIDDY HAD SAID WAS A FRESH BREAK IN THE PLASTER
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED AND WITH A GROWING FEELING OF UNCANNINESS I SET TO WORK ENLARGING THE OPENING
THIS ISN'T A LAWN
BUT THE BAR WAS GONE WHEN MARY ANNE AND ROSIE WENT UP TO PACK MY TRUNK THAT WASN'T ALL LIDDY'S VOICE CAME FUNEREALLY FROM A CORNER
SHE WAS ALMOST FORTY YEARS OLD AND HAD BEEN THE SISTER-MOTHER OF A LARGE FAMILY OF CHILDREN
A HAND IN AN EMPTY ROOM
I OUGHT NOT TO SEE HALSEY SHE SAID
AT THE FOOT OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE MR WINTERS WAS STILL ASLEEP
IN THE LIVING-ROOM WAS A HUGE OPEN FIREPLACE BUT IT WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE
THEN--I GOT THE STORY FROM THIS FELLOW
BUT I GIVE MYSELF CREDIT FOR THIS
IT WAS THE SUITOR WHOM I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE IN HEADLONG FLIGHT NOT THE LADY IN THE CASE
WHAT DID BAILEY DO WHEN HE WENT BACK TO THE KNICKERBOCKER APARTMENTS THAT NIGHT
THE MONEY WAS FOR LUCIEN'S BOARD UNTIL SHE RECOVERED
ON THE WAY HOME WE PASSED THE LITTLE CEMETERY WHERE THOMAS HAD BEEN LAID TO REST
AND THEN ON MY WAY DOWN THE STEPS I TURNED AROUND SUDDENLY
ONE WATCHES THE EARTH THROWN IN WITH THE FEELING THAT THIS IS THE END
A SKIN LIKE A BABY'S
MIS LOUISE WOULDN LET ME HE SAID EARNESTLY
HE IS NOT--DEAD I IMPLORED
I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER STRUCK EITHER OF US AS BEING RIDICULOUS AT THE TIME
WHAT WAS SIMPLER
HE WAS MUCH AFFECTED AND I GATHERED THAT HE HAD YEARNED OVER HIS RAGGED CHAPEL AS A MOTHER OVER A HALF-CLOTHED CHILD
ASK AHEAD
NO ONE HAD TIME FOR CLOSED GATES AND LODGE-KEEPERS
HE SAYS LOUISE ARMSTRONG WANTS TO COME HERE NOW THAT SHE IS RECOVERING AND WHAT DID YOU SAY I SAID WE WERE VERY SORRY WE COULD NOT LEAVE BUT WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE LOUISE COME UP HERE WITH US
SHE GAVE A SUPPRESSED YELL BOLTED INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD TIGHTLY CLUTCHING THE FOOT-BOARD OF THE BED
THERE WAS A SORT OF HUSH OVER THE SCENE
IT WAS AN UNWONTED CONCESSION TO THE OCCASION
THE MAN WAS DEAD
HIS CONFUSION UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE BEEN LUDICROUS
AND CAME TO WORK HERE SATURDAY MORNING FOR SOME UNEXPLAINED REASON THOMAS LOOKED RELIEVED
THE HOUSE WAS VERY STILL
IN HIS HAND HE HELD A SHAGGY GRAY WIG AND BEFORE ME ON THE FLOOR LAY THE MAN WHOSE HEADSTONE STOOD IN CASANOVA CHURCHYARD--PAUL ARMSTRONG
BUT WITH HALSEY'S DISAPPEARANCE EVERYTHING WAS ALTERED
SHE REPORTED A DECIDED COOLNESS IN THE GREETING BETWEEN LOUISE AND HER MOTHER AND THAT DOCTOR WALKER WAS THERE APPARENTLY IN CHARGE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FUNERAL
SHE HAD BEEN SUMMONED SHE SAID BY HER BROTHER AFTER MR ARMSTRONG HAD GONE
THE PLACE HAD NOT BEEN DISTURBED AND I PROCEEDED AT ONCE TO TRY TO DISCOVER THE ENTRANCE TO THE HIDDEN ROOM
IN THE NEXT ROOM I CALLED WILDLY
CHAPTER V GERTRUDE'S ENGAGEMENT AT TEN O'CLOCK THE CASANOVA HACK BROUGHT UP THREE MEN
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME HALSEY WELL THERE WERE TWO REASONS HE SAID SLOWLY
THEN WE OPENED THE DOOR INTO THE HALL WHERE CROWDED ON THE UPPER LANDING OF THE STAIRS THE MAIDS WHITE-FACED AND TREMBLING WERE PEERING DOWN HEADED BY LIDDY
UNLESS A CRIME IS COMMITTED IN THE OPEN THE INQUEST DOES NOTHING BEYOND GETTING EVIDENCE FROM WITNESSES WHILE EVENTS ARE STILL IN THEIR MINDS
THERE IS AN ORGANIZED ATTEMPT BEING MADE TO ENTER THIS HOUSE
THE LIGHTS CAME ON THEN AND WITH THE LONG FRENCH WINDOWS UNSHUTTERED I HAD A CREEPY FEELING THAT EACH ONE SHELTERED A PEERING FACE
ANYHOW I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'RE ANY WORSE OFF HERE THAN YOU WOULD BE IN THAT NIGHTMARE OF A HOUSE HE SAID FINALLY AND PUT HIS COAT ON THE STEPS OF THE SHAFT FOR ME TO SIT ON
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WERE UNEVENTFUL SAVE AS THEY MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN OUR PATIENT
NO I DON'T REMEMBER ANY SUCH FAMILY
ALL RIGHT AUNT RAY HE SAID STILL YAWNING
AS SOON AS I WAS SATISFIED THAT SHE HAD GONE HOWEVER I WENT OUT CAUTIOUSLY
THOMAS THE FOURTH VICTIM OF THE CONSPIRACY IS BURIED ON THE HILL
THERE WAS ONLY ONE SISTER LEFT THE BABY LUCY
B
B
B
AND WHEN THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY DOUBT THAT IT WAS HALSEY AND THAT HE WOULD PROBABLY RECOVER WE ALL LAUGHED AND CRIED TOGETHER
WHEN I SPOKE OF THE FIGURE LIDDY AND I HAD SEEN ON THE PORCH THROUGH THE CARD-ROOM WINDOW FRIDAY NIGHT HALSEY SAUNTERED INTO THE DARKENED ROOM AND TOGETHER WE STOOD THERE MUCH AS LIDDY AND I HAD DONE THAT OTHER NIGHT
I TOLD HER TO GET ME MY SLIPPERS AND SHE BROUGHT ME A PAIR OF KID GLOVES SO I FOUND MY THINGS MYSELF AND PREPARED TO CALL HALSEY
IF YOU'LL LET ME GET INTO SOMETHING IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO GET LIDDY OUT OF THE ROOM
THEN WE DROVE SLOWLY HOME
THAT'S LIKE A WOMAN GERTRUDE WHO HAD BEEN PALE AND DESPAIRING DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE CONVERSATION HAD FLUSHED AN INDIGNANT RED
BUT AS WE OPENED THE OUTER DOOR SOMETHING FELL INTO THE ENTRY WITH A CLATTER
IT WAS CAUTIOUS AND I WAS ABOUT TO CALL LIDDY
HE DECIDED TO GO WEST AND FIND PAUL ARMSTRONG AND TO FORCE HIM TO DISGORGE
IN A MINUTE A WOMAN DARTED INTO THE AREA OF LIGHT MADE BY THE OPEN DOOR AND CAUGHT ME BY THE ARM
FROM THE FOURTH STEP SHE FIRED
HE WENT THROUGH HIS POCKETS FOUND A LITTLE MONEY AND THE CUFF-LINKS AND TOOK THEM
WHAT IS IT MISS INNES HE ASKED ANXIOUSLY
THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE IN THE DARKNESS SOME ONE WHO BREATHED HARD AND WHO WAS SO CLOSE I COULD HAVE TOUCHED HIM WITH MY HAND
WE WENT THE FOUR OF US IN THE MACHINE PREFERRING THE EXECRABLE ROADS TO THE MATINEE TRAIN WITH HALF OF CASANOVA STARING AT US
THERE WAS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT INSIDE HAD BEEN MYSTERY AND VIOLENCE AND SUDDEN DEATH
WHO WAS THE MAN WHOSE BODY WE HAD RESURRECTED
I HAD THE DOCTOR PUT ME DOWN AT THE GATE AND I WALKED TO THE HOUSE--PAST THE LODGE WHERE WE HAD FOUND LOUISE AND LATER POOR THOMAS
THERE SHE WENT SOMETIMES TO SEE THE BOY AND THERE HE HAD TAKEN FEVER
HALSEY HAD OPENED THE CHRONICLE AND WAS STARING AT IT FIXEDLY
A THANKLESS CHILD IS SHARPER THAN A SERPENT'S TOOTH NONSENSE I SAID BRUSKLY
HE SEEMED TO BE EXCITED AND HE SAID MISS ARMSTRONG HAD TAKEN A SUDDEN NOTION TO GO HOME AND HE SENT ME SOME MONEY
HOWEVER I PUT THE BAG IN THE BACK OF MY MIND WHICH WAS FAST BECOMING STORED WITH ANOMALOUS AND APPARENTLY IRRECONCILABLE FACTS AND FOLLOWED WARNER TO THE HOUSE
THE NEXT I FEARED THAT IT HAD BEEN GERTRUDE HERSELF THAT NIGHT ALONE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
THE SWISH OF A BODY AGAINST THE CURVING RAIL AS IF FOR GUIDANCE WAS PLAIN ENOUGH AND NOW WHOEVER IT WAS HAD REACHED THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF OUR RIGID SILHOUETTES AGAINST THE BILLIARD-ROOM DOORWAY
THEN APPARENTLY HE STARTED DIRECTLY FOR THE STATION
DO YOU KNOW AT WHAT TIME THEY LEFT I DO GERTRUDE ANSWERED FIRMLY
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I DID SEE A MAN THAT LIMPED
I HEARD HIM DRAW A LONG BREATH AND TURN TO GROPE HIS WAY THROUGH THE BLACKNESS
GIVE ME MY REVOLVER AUNT RAY HE SAID
AND THEN GERTRUDE OPENED THE DOOR ADMITTING MR JAMIESON AND A STOCKY MIDDLE-AGED MAN
HE DIED THIS MORNING IN CALIFORNIA
WAS IT ROBBERY NO I SAID DECIDEDLY
I WAS NEVER MORE COMPOSED IN MY LIFE
IT IS THE NEAREST APPROACH TO ANYTHING TANGIBLE THAT WE HAVE HAD YET WARNER TOOK US TO RICHFIELD IN THE CAR
HE LOOKED SUFFICIENTLY SURPRISED AT SEEING ME
THERE WAS THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS IN THE LOWER HALL AND SOME ONE BOUNDED UP THE STAIRS
IT WAS A WELCOME DISTRACTION AND GERTRUDE WAS SOON HERSELF AGAIN
THE VERY SET OF HER SHOULDERS EXPRESSED DISAPPROVAL
WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS HELP WITHIN CALL SOMETHING KEPT ME FROM WAKING HIM
WE--WE TALKED FOR A MINUTE THEN I PUT ON MY DRESSING-GOWN AND SLIPPERS AND WENT DOWN-STAIRS WITH HIM
NOBODY HURT IS THERE HE WAS LOOKING AT GERTRUDE
I HAVE NO DOUBT NOW I SAID THAT IT WAS ARNOLD ARMSTRONG THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST TOO
THE TWO WENT HURRIEDLY TO THE VAULT
I MERELY WISHED THE ADDRESS OF THOMAS PEOPLE
WHEN THE ALARM WAS RAISED SHE HAD HAD NO TIME TO GET UP-STAIRS
GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT I MIGHT DO TO A FELLOW LIKE THAT IF THERE WAS ENOUGH PROVOCATION AND I HAD A GUN IN MY HAND--UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES
IT WAS VERY FINE BLACK-BORDERED AND IT HAD THREE HAND-WORKED LETTERS IN THE CORNER--F
I CLEARED HALSEY AND GERTRUDE AWAY TO A HOUSE PARTY AND MOVED OUT TO SUNNYSIDE THE FIRST OF MAY
WHEN THE DOOR HAD CLOSED AND LOUISE REALIZED THAT HALSEY HAD NOT COME HER EXPRESSION CHANGED
DON'T YOU DO IT MISS RACHEL
HE HAD AN EYE TO COMFORT AND HE KEPT VIGIL IN A HEAVY OAK CHAIR VERY LARGE AND DEEP
JUST LOOK AUNT RACHEL HE SAID WITH A FLOURISH
MRS WATSON WENT INTO HER ROOM AND FOUND SHE HAD GONE WITHOUT HER HAT
AND FROM SOME CHANCE REMARK LET FALL SOME MONTHS EARLIER BY ARNOLD ARMSTRONG AT A DINNER BAILEY FELT SURE THERE WAS A HIDDEN ROOM AT SUNNYSIDE
THEY MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS THE LAWN AND UP THE STEPS
MR INNES THE CORONER SAID WILL YOU TELL UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES YOU SAW MR ARNOLD ARMSTRONG THE NIGHT HE DIED I SAW HIM FIRST AT THE COUNTRY CLUB HALSEY SAID QUIETLY
MR JAMIESON WENT FORWARD AND SPOKE A FEW WORDS TO THE CORONER WHO NODDED
IT WAS ENTIRELY IN VAIN
MR JAMIESON HAD LOCKED SOMEBODY IN THE CLOTHES CHUTE
BUT THE DOCTOR HAD NO INTENTION OF LEAVING
IS IT LIKELY I WOULD KILL HER BROTHER HER STEPBROTHER I CORRECTED
MR JAMIESON HAD BEEN BEFORE ME AND THE DOOR STOOD OPEN
SHE WAS INTERRUPTED BY MR JAMIESON'S REAPPEARANCE
FROM THE DAY MR JAMIESON CAME TO SUNNYSIDE THERE WAS A SUBTLE CHANGE IN GERTRUDE'S MANNER TO ME
THE INACTION WAS DEADLY
HALSEY I HAVE NEVER TOLD THIS EVEN TO GERTRUDE BUT THE MORNING AFTER THE CRIME I FOUND IN A TULIP BED A REVOLVER
I LOVE HIM--LOVE HIM SHE SOBBED IN A SURRENDER THAT WAS TOTALLY UNLIKE HER
I TELL YOU YOU CAN SCOFF ALL YOU LIKE
MR BAILEY LEFT WHICH WAY MR JAMIESON ASKED SHARPLY
THE HOUSE ON CHESTNUT STREET IN TOWN HAD BEEN OPENED AND TUESDAY MORNING LOUISE LEFT US TO GO HOME
SHE'S DOING NOTHING OF THE SORT,--AND DON'T PINCH MY ARM
IT--IT MUST HAVE FALLEN OUT OF A BOX ON MY DRESSING-TABLE WHATEVER HE THOUGHT OF MY EXPLANATION AND I KNEW HE DOUBTED IT HE MADE NO SIGN
THOMAS GAVE A CLUTCH AT HIS COAT WHIRLED TO THE SINK FILLED A TUMBLER WITH WATER AND POURED IT INTO HIS RIGHT POCKET WITH THE CELERITY OF PRACTICE
THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE MISS INNES HE SAID AFTER WE HAD SHAKEN HANDS
WHERE IS HALSEY HE ASKED
HE HAD GROWN INTO A BEAUTIFUL BOY AND HE WAS ALL ANNE HAD TO LIVE FOR
THEN--WHO HAD DUG THE OTHER HOLE IN THE FALSE PARTITION
COME IN MRS WATSON THE LAWYER SAID
SHE HAD NOT BEEN TO BED EVIDENTLY
LIDDY I SAID AT LAST DON'T DARE TO DENY THAT YOU ARE HAVING THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE
I BELIEVE AS FIRMLY AS I BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT DOCTOR WALKER KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT HALSEY AND THAT HE COULD PUT HIS FINGER ON HIM IF HE WANTED TO THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS THAT DAY THAT BEWILDERED ME
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
I HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF ANYTHING BUT THAT IT WAS ARNOLD UNTIL I REACHED THE DOOR
IT WAS NOT FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE I WAS UP-STAIRS ARMED WITH A TAPE-MEASURE IN LIEU OF A FOOT-RULE EAGER TO JUSTIFY MR JAMIESON'S OPINION OF MY INTELLIGENCE AND FIRMLY RESOLVED NOT TO TELL HIM OF MY SUSPICION UNTIL I HAD MORE THAN THEORY TO GO ON
THE LOAN CLERK DID NOT COME BACK
I WILL PUT IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY THEN
I HAVE THE USUAL SCRUPLES ABOUT COERCING PEOPLE'S SERVANTS AWAY BUT FEW OF US HAVE ANY CONSCIENCE REGARDING INSTITUTIONS OR CORPORATIONS--WITNESS THE WAY WE BEAT RAILROADS AND STREET-CAR COMPANIES WHEN WE CAN--SO I CALLED UP THE CLUB AND ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK THOMAS JOHNSON CAME TO SEE ME
IT WAS WITH MY NEAREST APPROACH TO A NERVOUS COLLAPSE THAT I HEARD THE FAMILIAR THROBBING OF AN AUTOMOBILE ENGINE
IT WAS TAKEN AWAY AT DAYLIGHT WHEN THE TRAIN WAS MOVED THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED
GERTRUDE WAS ON HER FEET NOW BUT SHE LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR FOR SUPPORT
I HAD MADE SO MANY NOCTURNAL EXCURSIONS AROUND THE PLACE THAT I KNEW MY WAY PERFECTLY
A FEW FEET AWAY IN THE HALL WAS THE SPOT WHERE THE BODY OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG HAD BEEN FOUND
WITH A CRASH I HAD TURNED IT ON ITS SIDE WEDGING IT AGAINST THE DOOR ITS LEGS AGAINST THE STAIRS
THAT WAS BAD ENOUGH THOUGH I HAD PLENTY IF THEY WOULD LET ME SHARE
WITH THE FATHER AND MOTHER IN THE WEST I FIND EVERYTHING DEVOLVES ON ME
THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE TO ME UNLESS THEY HAVE A HALL MARK OF SOME BRIGHT COLOR--THE BIRDS WERE CHIRPING IN THE HEDGES AND EVERYTHING BREATHED OF PEACE
HE TOLD ME WHAT I HAD NOT REALIZED BEFORE--THAT IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO FIND HALSEY AT ONCE EVEN WITH THIS CLUE
IT WAS DIFFERENT WITH THE YOUNG WIFE HOWEVER
IT HAD BEEN SHORTLY AFTER THEIR EXAMINATION THAT THE PRESIDENT WHO HAD BEEN IN BAD HEALTH HAD GONE TO CALIFORNIA
THERE WERE TWO WHITE STONE PILLARS TO MARK THE ENTRANCE BUT THE IRON GATES ONCE CLOSED AND TENDED BY THE LODGE-KEEPER NOW STOOD PERMANENTLY OPEN
I AM GLAD IN THIS WAY TO SETTLE THE GRAY LADY STORY WHICH IS STILL A CHOICE MORSEL IN CASANOVA
THEY WERE QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF US
WHY JACK TOOK MY REVOLVER WITH HIM DIDN'T HE OH FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE DON'T SAY THAT I IMPLORED
THERE'S JUST ONE THING WE MAY BANK ON MISS INNES
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM IF HE IS HERE HE IS NOT HERE JUST NOW I SAID AS QUIETLY AS I COULD
THEN AFTER A PAUSE HE WENT BACK TO HER AGAIN
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY WOMAN I CAN THINK OF THAT I CAN TAKE ALONG HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU DOING HERE TAKING A WALK I SAID TRYING TO BE COMPOSED
SHE'S AWAKE LIDDY SAID LOOKING UNEASILY DOWN THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE WHICH WAS BESIDE ME
HALSEY STOOD LOOKING AT ME WITH SHUT LIPS
BUT GERTRUDE GOT UP AND PUT HER ARMS AROUND LIDDY'S SHAKING SHOULDERS
I MEASURED FIVE MINUTES BY COUNTING MY PULSE ALLOWING SEVENTY-TWO BEATS TO THE MINUTE
BELIEVE ME THINGS ALWAYS COME OUT
ONCE HE FELL AND HIS IMPETUS WAS SO GREAT THAT HE TURNED AN INVOLUNTARY SOMERSAULT
BUT WE DID NOT GO TO BED AT ALL
C AND I THEN KNEW KNEW AS SURELY AS IF I HAD SEEN THE WHOLE THING
THE DAY DETECTIVE WAS WATCHING HIM SITTING ON THE CARRIAGE BLOCK
DID HE NOT MEET YOU NO MR JAMIESON LOOKED SLIGHTLY SURPRISED
HE TOOK SOME NOTES AFTER THIS BUT HE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO MAKE THE NEXT TRAIN BACK TO TOWN
IF SHE HAD ONLY COME TO ME WITH THE WHOLE TRUTH THEN
WELL I WILL STOP IN THIS AFTERNOON TO SEE HOW MY PATIENT IS GETTING ALONG HE DROVE AWAY THEN AND I STOOD LOOKING AFTER HIM
WHERE'S THE LAUNDRY KEY KEPT IT'S KEPT IN THE DOOR LIDDY SNAPPED
I AM NOT FOND OF A HEIGHT
I APPRECIATE YOUR DESIRE TO HAVE EVERYTHING NICE FOR HIM I WENT ON BUT THE NEXT TIME YOU MIGHT TAKE THE LIMOGES CHINA IT'S MORE EASILY DUPLICATED AND LESS EXPENSIVE I HAVEN'T A YOUNG MAN--NOT HERE SHE HAD GOT HER BREATH NOW AS I HAD GUESSED SHE WOULD
WHOA FLINDERS HE SHOUTED
I DON'T KNOW AUNT RAY HE SAID DUBIOUSLY
THEN IT HAD NOT BEEN GERTRUDE AFTER ALL
I WAS CONNECTED MOST UNPLEASANTLY WITH A COLD-BLOODED CRIME AND MY NIECE AND NEPHEW WERE PRACTICALLY BEGGARED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY
YOU POSITIVELY GLOAT IN THIS EXCITEMENT
ALSO DOCTOR WALKER KNEW WHO LUCIEN WALLACE WAS AND HIS VERY DENIAL MADE ME CONFIDENT THAT IN THAT ONE DIRECTION AT LEAST WE WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK
ONCE THERE HOWEVER I WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF BREATH
BAILEY GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE CRASH AT THE BANK UNTIL HE READ IT IN THE PAPER MONDAY NIGHT AND THAT HE WENT BACK AND SURRENDERED HIMSELF IMMEDIATELY
HE DROPPED ON HIS KNEES BESIDE THE BED AND TRIED TO TELL HER SHE WAS ALL RIGHT AND WE WOULD BRING HER AROUND IN A HURRY AND HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED--ONLY TO BREAK DOWN UTTERLY AND HAVE TO STOP
DOCTOR WALKER I SAID TARTLY I FAIL TO SEE ANY HUMOR IN THE SITUATION
AND THE AIR
ROSIE HAD TAKEN HER COURAGE IN HER HANDS AND COMING IN HAD TURNED UP THE LIGHT
ROSIE IS PROBABLY A GOOD COOK SNIFF
I REALIZED BITTERLY THAT IF THE SOUND WAS HEARD AT ALL NO DOUBT IT WAS CLASSED WITH THE OTHER RAPPINGS THAT HAD SO ALARMED US RECENTLY
IS SHE--IS SHE VERY BAD MIS INNES BAD ENOUGH I SAID COLDLY
THE PAPER BOY TURNED AND LOOKED AROUND
MRS WATSON MADE SOME TEA AND TOOK IT TO THE LODGE BUT LOUISE MADE THEM BOTH PROMISE TO KEEP HER PRESENCE A SECRET
CHAPTER III MR
SEND AWAY YOUR TRAP AND LET ME DRIVE YOU HOME
THEY MAY ONLY BE HURT AND WE MUST FIND THEM SHE SAID HER EYES DILATED WITH EXCITEMENT
THEY CERTAINLY LOOK LIKE IT I THINK THE DETECTIVE HAD A PLAN ON WHICH HE WAS WORKING AND WHICH WAS MEANT TO BE A COUP
IT BURST OPEN WITH THE IMPETUS OF A WEIGHT BEHIND IT AND SOMETHING FELL PARTLY FORWARD IN A HEAP ON THE FLOOR
SO LIDDY ARRANGED THE SCRAPS LIKE WORKING OUT ONE OF THE PUZZLE-PICTURES CHILDREN PLAY WITH AND SHE DID IT WITH MUCH THE SAME EAGERNESS
THEY GIVE TEA TO THE DYING AND THEY PUT IT IN THE BABY'S NURSING BOTTLE
HE HAD BEEN SUMMONED BY TELEPHONE TO SUNNYSIDE HAD COME OVER AT ONCE WITH THE STEWARD AND MR WINTHROP AT PRESENT OUT OF TOWN
IN FACT I HAD SOME SUCH THEORY MYSELF
THE MURDER AND THOMAS SUDDEN DEATH WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO VIEW IN A DETACHED SORT OF WAY
HE SLIPPED HIS STRONG YOUNG ARM AROUND MY SHOULDERS AND TURNED ME SO I FACED THE LIGHT
THEN SHE RANG THE BELL AND THE MINUTE THE DOOR WAS OPENED SHE WAS THROUGH IT AND INTO THE HALL HOW LONG DID SHE STAY THAT'S THE QUEER PART OF IT RIGGS SAID EAGERLY
I FELT WEAK AND DIZZY BUT I MANAGED TO GET UP AND TOTTER TO THE DOOR
BUT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND WITHDREW
THE VERDICT WAS THAT ARNOLD ARMSTRONG HAD MET HIS DEATH AT THE HANDS OF A PERSON OR PERSONS UNKNOWN AND WE ALL PREPARED TO LEAVE
THEY SCREAMED WHEN THEY SAW ME AND DREW BACK TO LET ME PASS
WELL I TELEGRAPHED THE DOCTOR WHERE MISS LOUISE WAS AND I KEPT AN EYE ON HER
THIS CHILD NOW PERHAPS TWENTY WAS LOUISE ARMSTRONG HAVING TAKEN HER STEPFATHER'S NAME AND WAS AT PRESENT IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE FAMILY
WHEN I MENTIONED THIS TO LIDDY SHE MERELY RAISED HER EYEBROWS
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU I WENT ON PUTTING MY HAND OVER THE SCRAPS THAT WHEN PEOPLE TEAR UP THEIR CORRESPONDENCE IT IS FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF KEEPING IT FROM BEING READ IF THEY WASN'T ASHAMED OF IT THEY WOULDN'T TAKE SO MUCH TROUBLE MISS RACHEL LIDDY SAID ORACULARLY
THE ROOM ITSELF WAS SHROUDED IN BLACKNESS
MRS WATSON TRIED TO HIDE FROM ARNOLD BUT HE WAS UGLY
GROSSMUTTER HE SAID
I--I MUST SEE GERTRUDE TOO
WHEN I HAD GOT INTO A NEGLIGEE--I USED TO SAY WRAPPER BEFORE GERTRUDE CAME BACK FROM SCHOOL--I LET HIM IN
SHE HAD THOUGHT IT WAS PROBABLY HER BROTHER AND HAD BEEN ABOUT TO GO TO THE DOOR WHEN SHE HEARD IT OPEN
I HAVE TRIED TO TRACE THEM AND FAILED ALL AT ONCE I REMEMBERED THE TELEGRAM SENT TO LOUISE BY SOME ONE SIGNED F
BEYOND THAT AND HER REPUTATION AT BRIDGE WHICH IS INSUFFERABLY BAD--SHE IS THE WORST PLAYER AT THE BRIDGE CLUB--I KNOW LITTLE OF HER
HE ENTERED THE BILLIARD-ROOM WING--PERHAPS RAPPING AND BEING ADMITTED BY YOUR NEPHEW
HIS MOTHER PAID ONE WEEK'S BOARD IN ADVANCE
NO I SAID SHARPLY I'M NOT GOING TO USE BLUING AT MY TIME OF LIFE OR STARCH EITHER LIDDY'S NERVES ARE GONE SHE SAYS SINCE THAT AWFUL SUMMER BUT SHE HAS ENOUGH LEFT GOODNESS KNOWS
SO FAR ALL I AM SURE OF IS THIS
THEN HE REALIZED THAT LUCIEN WAS THE RULING PASSION IN THIS LONELY WOMAN'S LIFE
I THINK THEY CAME INTO THE VILLAGE
IN FACT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE IN THE INTERVAL SINCE THE SECURITIES HAD BEEN TAKEN
I MERELY STUMBLED ALONG IN SILENCE ALLOWING MR JAMIESON TO GUIDE ME THIS WAY OR THAT AS THE PATH DEMANDED
ONE RESULT OF MY MEDITATIONS WAS THAT I GOT UP SUDDENLY AND WENT TO THE TELEPHONE
WARNER I CALLED COME BACK HERE
YOU CAN'T HELP HIM
I LOATHE THAT MAN GERTRUDE CAME BACK VERY SOON HER FACE RATHER FLUSHED
FOR TWENTY YEARS I HAD BEEN PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE
SO WHEN HALSEY SUGGESTED CAMPING IN THE ADIRONDACKS AND GERTRUDE WANTED BAR HARBOR WE COMPROMISED ON A GOOD COUNTRY HOUSE WITH LINKS NEAR WITHIN MOTOR DISTANCE OF TOWN AND TELEPHONE DISTANCE OF THE DOCTOR
WHO WAS IT FELL DOWN THE CLOTHES CHUTE
ABOUT FORTY I SUPPOSE
YOU HEARD THIS BEFORE AND SCOFFED
WHY HE CAME TO ME FROM THE BRAYS WHO ARE IN EUROPE EXACTLY THE DETECTIVE SMILED
WE'LL HAVE TO GET TO THE TELEPHONE NOT OUT IN THE HALL SHE GASPED
THE CLOSING OF THE TRADERS BANK I CONSIDERED UNNECESSARY FOR HER TO KNOW BUT THE DEATH OF HER STEPFATHER AND STEPBROTHER MUST BE BROKEN TO HER SOON OR SHE MIGHT HEAR IT IN SOME UNEXPECTED AND SHOCKING MANNER
I AM GOING TO PACK UP AND TO-MORROW I AM GOING TO LEAVE YOU'LL DO NOTHING OF THE SORT I SNAPPED
THE ARMSTRONGS WERE NOTIFIED OF THOMAS DEATH AND I HAD MY FIRST INTERVIEW WITH DOCTOR WALKER AS A RESULT
THE STEPS WERE CLOSE NOW AND SUDDENLY I THOUGHT OF GERTRUDE
BUT IT WAS THE FIRST REAL INFORMATION WE HAD HAD
WE'LL HAVE TO CLEAR THIS THING AT ONCE
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IT WAS ABSURD TO LEAVE THAT CHINA DOTTED ALONG THE ROAD FOR HER TO SPY THE NEXT MORNING
TWO STEPS OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE HAD BEEN PRIED OFF WITHOUT RESULT AND BEYOND A SECOND MESSAGE FROM GERTRUDE THAT HALSEY INSISTED ON COMING HOME AND THEY WOULD ARRIVE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS NOTHING NEW
I SAW MR JAMIESON SMILING TO HIMSELF AND THE CORONER GAVE ME UP AFTER A TIME
DIDN'T YOU SLEEP LAST NIGHT NO MA'M SHE SAID STIFFLY
WHY DID THE TRUNK-ROOM HAVE BOTH A RADIATOR AND AN OPEN FIREPLACE
AND SOMEWHERE ELSE PERHAPS LUCY WOULD PLEAD FOR HER
PROBABLY LIVING SAFELY IN SOME EXTRADITIONLESS COUNTRY ON THE FORTUNE HE HAD STOLEN
THEN I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT SOME ONE WAS RUNNING UP THE DRIVE
THE WHOLE PLACE IS LOCKED HE SAID ANGRILY
WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE VILLAGE I RESENTED HIS ATTEMPT AT PLAYFULNESS
TRAPPED AS SHE WAS SHE DID NOT WANT TO SEE AN INNOCENT MAN ARRESTED
MY NERVES SEEMED TO BE IN A STATE OF PARALYSIS
WHO IS IT HE CALLED IMPERIOUSLY AND TOOK A HALF DOZEN RAPID STRIDES TOWARD THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE
JACK--TOLD US--SOMETHING GERTRUDE SAID FAINTLY
BUT IT TOOK ETERNITIES AND TOWARD THE LAST I FOUND IT HARD TO COUNT
AND THEN I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE NIGHT BEFORE
WITH JOHNNY SWEENY A CLOUD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD AND THE DINNER-HOUR APPROACHING I HURRIED ON WITH MY INVESTIGATIONS
AS FOR THOMAS IT IS MRS ARMSTRONG'S WISH THAT YOU WOULD ALLOW HER TO ATTEND TO THE EXPENSE
I HAVE A REASON FOR ASKING IT WAS TO BE I BELIEVE ON THE ARMSTRONG PLACE
WHAT TO DO WITH MY BOOTS WAS THE GREATEST PUZZLE OF ALL THERE BEING NO PLACE IN THE HOUSE SAFE FROM LIDDY UNTIL I DECIDED TO SLIP UPSTAIRS THE NEXT MORNING AND DROP THEM INTO THE HOLE THE GHOST HAD MADE IN THE TRUNK-ROOM WALL
LIDDY HAD BEEN SLEEPING IN LOUISE'S DRESSING-ROOM ON A COUCH AND THE APPROACH OF DUSK WAS A SIGNAL FOR HER TO BARRICADE THE ENTIRE SUITE
HE MUST HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY
I WROTE THE TELEGRAM DOWN WORD FOR WORD AFRAID TO TRUST MY MEMORY AND DECIDED TO ASK DOCTOR STEWART HOW SOON LOUISE MIGHT BE TOLD THE TRUTH
I GATHERED MY SILK GOWN AROUND ME AND SUCCEEDED FINALLY IN MAKING THE TOP OF THE LADDER
FOR SOME REASON IT REFUSED TO WORK AND THE KEY WAS WITHDRAWN
WE WERE ONLY MEASURING WEAPONS
THE VOICES CEASED AT ONCE
WE ARE TRYING TO TRACE A MAN WHO WAS SEEN LOITERING AROUND SUNNYSIDE LAST NIGHT BEFORE THE FIRE HE WAS ALL ATTENTION IN A MOMENT
I WANT YOU TO LET ME SEE WHAT'S IN THAT BASKET SHE GOT UP IN HER EXCITEMENT AND TOOK HOLD OF MY ARM
THE ODDEST PART IS MISS INNES THAT THE THUMB-MARK IS PROBABLY YOURS AND THE FOOTPRINT CERTAINLY HIS AUDACITY WAS THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED ME
MR JAMIESON SHUT HIS NOTE-BOOK WITH A SNAP AND THANKED US
SOMEHOW THE HUGE DINING-ROOM DEPRESSED ME AND THOMAS CHEERFUL ENOUGH ALL DAY ALLOWED HIS SPIRITS TO GO DOWN WITH THE SUN
IT WOULDN'T BE DONE THAT WAY HE SAID
A WOMAN OF YOUR AGE OUGHT TO HAVE BETTER SENSE IT USUALLY BRACES LIDDY TO MENTION HER AGE
IT HAD BEEN MR JAMIESON'S IDEA THAT THE HIDDEN ROOM IF THERE WAS ONE WOULD BE FOUND SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
THE STRONGEST THING AGAINST HIM IS HIS PREPARATION FOR FLIGHT AND HIS DECIDING TO COME BACK AFTER THE MURDER OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG
LIDDY HAD HER EYES SHUT--SHE ALWAYS SHUTS THEM WHEN SHE'S FRIGHTENED AND YOU NEVER THOUGHT THEN THAT THE INTRUDER WHO CAME LATER THAT NIGHT MIGHT BE A WOMAN--THE WOMAN IN FACT WHOM YOU SAW ON THE VERANDA I HAD REASONS FOR THINKING IT WAS A MAN I SAID REMEMBERING THE PEARL CUFF-LINK
BOTH GERTRUDE AND I RECOGNIZED THE FUTILITY OF ASKING LOUISE ANY QUESTIONS
HE ASKED TO BE SHOWN WHERE ARNOLD ARMSTRONG'S BODY HAD BEEN FOUND AND I TOOK HIM THERE
FORTUNATELY LOUISE DOESN'T AGREE WITH HER FAMILY
I WANT TO GO TO THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL
THAT COMPLETED OUR DEMORALIZATION
PAUL ARMSTRONG HAD A BESETTING EVIL--THE LOVE OF MONEY
HIS DEFENSES WERE UP AND I LEFT HALF IRRITATED AND WHOLLY BAFFLED
WHY DID I STEP INTO THE TULIP BED I ASKED WITH INTEREST
THEN I CREPT DOWN THE STAIRS GOING VERY SLOWLY AND LISTENING WITH ALL MY EARS
I DIDN'T SEE HIS FACE
WHEN I WENT BACK MR HARTON WAS FURTIVELY WIPING HIS EYES
IF THERE HAD BEEN A MAN THERE SHE WOULD HAVE HAD HIM IN THE KITCHEN AND BEEN FEEDING HIM WHAT WAS LEFT FROM DINNER INSIDE OF AN HOUR FROM FORCE OF HABIT
IS IT LAID MR JAMIESON I SAID SUDDENLY I WISH YOU WOULD DO ONE THING
I NEVER EXPECTED TO COME TO THIS HE SAID ONCE
EAGER TO GET HALSEY AND JACK BAILEY OUT OF THE HOUSE HE WENT UP TO THE EAST ENTRY AND IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM GAVE THE CASHIER WHAT HE HAD REFUSED EARLIER IN THE EVENING--THE ADDRESS OF PAUL ARMSTRONG IN CALIFORNIA AND A TELEGRAM WHICH HAD BEEN FORWARDED TO THE CLUB FOR BAILEY FROM DOCTOR WALKER
WHO HAD ACCOSTED ROSIE ON THE DRIVE
LIDDY HAD GONE TO SLEEP AS I KNEW SHE WOULD
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ASK ME TO LOCK UP MISS RACHEL SHE QUAVERED
MR JAMIESON EXAMINED THE WINDOWS
I WAS TOO MUCH SHAKEN TO SCOLD
OH I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS
LIDDY WAS HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF THE DOOR AFRAID AS USUAL TO BE LEFT ALONE AND NOT QUITE DARING TO ENTER
THERE WAS CERTAINLY SOMETHING GOING ON DOWN BELOW
IT WAS ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE MILES BY RAILROAD BUT BY TAKING A SERIES OF ATROCIOUSLY ROUGH SHORT CUTS WE GOT THERE VERY QUICKLY
IN SPITE OF MYSELF I HAD A CHILLY SENSATION IN THE SMALL OF MY BACK AND I LEFT HIM MUMBLING OVER HIS DISHES
FROM SOMEWHERE IN COLORADO SHE SENT AN ANONYMOUS TELEGRAM TO JACK BAILEY AT THE TRADERS BANK
BAILEY WELL IT IS ALL OVER NOW
UPON MY WORD HALSEY BROKE OUT THIS PLACE IS A WALKING NIGHTMARE
INDEED THE DOCTOR SAID AFTERWARD THAT LIVING ON LIQUID DIET HAD BEEN A SPLENDID REST FOR HER STOMACH
HE SAID HIS NERVES WERE BAD AND I GAVE HIM A PRESCRIPTION FOR THEM
I DON'T SEE WITH MY NOSE I REMARKED
HOW SIMPLE IT ALL SEEMED
HOME MONDAY
TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS LOCKED
THE WINDOW WAS THE SAME GRAYISH RECTANGLE IN THE BLACKNESS AS BEFORE
IN HIS BLIND FURY HE HAD MISSED ME
WHAT WE HAD TO SAY WAS TOO IMPORTANT TO COMMENCE THERE AND BESIDES IT TOOK ALL KINDS OF COAXING FROM BOTH MEN TO GET THE DRAGON FLY UP THE LAST GRADE
SOME ONE HAD BEEN STRUCK WITH A GOLF-BALL THAT HAD GONE WILD
BECAUSE HIS PHYSICIAN TESTIFIED THAT HE IS ILL AND UNABLE TO LEAVE HIS BED ILL I EXCLAIMED
WHERE IS THE FREIGHT CAR THAT WAS RAMMED THE DOCTOR ASKED A BYSTANDER
IT'S MY OPINION ALL THIS RUNNING AROUND AND GETTING JOLTED OUT OF A RUT HAS STIRRED UP THAT TORPID LIVER OF YOURS IT'S NOT MYSELF I'M THINKING ABOUT SHE SAID GOADED INTO SPEECH
I SHALL STAY UNTIL SOME EXPLANATION IS FOUND FOR CERTAIN THINGS
THAT NIGHT THE COOK'S SISTER HAD A BABY--THE COOK SEEING INDECISION IN MY FACE MADE IT TWINS ON SECOND THOUGHT--AND TO BE SHORT BY NOON THE NEXT DAY THE HOUSEHOLD STAFF WAS DOWN TO LIDDY AND MYSELF
NO SHE IS NOT IN A CRITICAL STATE NOW BUT THE DOCTOR SAYS SHE MUST HAVE ABSOLUTE QUIET WHEN I HAD HUNG UP THE RECEIVER I SAT DOWN TO THINK
WHEN THEY DIDN'T SHOUT AT ME--IN MY UNIFORM YOU KNOW--I TOOK IT THEY WERE STRANGERS SO ALL WE HAD FOR OUR AFTERNOON'S WORK WAS THIS
I CAN'T HALSEY AND I STOOD HELPLESS BEFORE THE STORM
I THINK ABSOLUTE TERROR HAD HIM BY THE THROAT
HE WAS A DOCTOR OF THE OLD SCHOOL OF THE CLASS OF FAMILY PRACTITIONER THAT IS FAST DYING OUT
I HAVE TURNED VERY GRAY--LIDDY REMINDED ME OF IT ONLY YESTERDAY BY SAYING THAT A LITTLE BLUING IN THE RINSE-WATER WOULD MAKE MY HAIR SILVERY INSTEAD OF A YELLOWISH WHITE
GERMAN HE COMMENTED
THE MEN WERE STILL IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM WHEN I FINALLY DOZED OFF AND THE LAST THING I REMEMBER WAS THE HOWL OF A DOG IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE
BAILEY WAS ALMOST DESPERATE
TELL THEM NOT TO WAIT FOR ANYTHING SHE WENT UP THE STAIRS AT THAT TWO AT A TIME
HAS THE DAY OF GOOD COMMON SENSE GONE BY
I AM GOING TO GET OUT TO SEE LOUISE SHE ASKED
THE FIRST NECESSITY WAS AN ACCOMPLICE
BLESS MY SOUL NO
HE MUST HAVE BEEN ADMITTED FROM WITHIN THE HOUSE
NO I REPLIED STARTLED
BUT SHE WOULDN'T WAIT AND THE BROKEN CHINA--IN THE BASKET WELL BROKEN CHINA'S DEATH TO RUBBER TIRES HE SAID
THE FIRST THING THAT OCCURRED WAS A MESSAGE FROM THE CHARITY HOSPITAL THAT MRS WATSON WAS DYING AND HAD ASKED FOR ME
KINDLY PROCEED DOCTOR THE CORONER SAID
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HOURS FOR I HAD BEEN TIRED FROM A BUSY DAY AND I WAKENED STIFF FROM MY AWKWARD POSITION
AND AS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT IS AN UNPLEASANT DUTY NO DOUBT I SAID ABSENTLY
WHO ADMITTED HIM
WHAT HAVE YOU LOCKED IN THE LAUNDRY I CAN'T WAIT TO EXPLAIN I REPLIED
WHATEVER HAS HAPPENED SINCE I NEVER BLAMED HALSEY AND GERTRUDE FOR TAKING ME THERE
I HAD A GREAT MANY THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IN THOSE DAYS
I HARDLY KNEW IF I WERE MORE ANXIOUS OR LESS
THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF CONVENIENCES AND I HAD NO REASON TO REPENT MY BARGAIN SAVE THE FACT THAT IN THE NATURE OF THINGS NIGHT MUST COME AGAIN
AT THE TIME I LAID THE CHANGE TO THE FACT THAT I HAD FORBIDDEN ALL COMMUNICATION WITH JOHN BAILEY AND HAD REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO
ONE END HOWEVER OVER THE EAST WING HAD BEEN LEFT ONLY ROUGHLY FINISHED THE INTENTION HAVING BEEN TO CONVERT IT INTO A BALL-ROOM AT SOME FUTURE TIME
HE SLIPPED ON TO THE BUMPER OF A CAR AND PEERED THROUGH
WITH ANOTHER WARNING TO MRS TATE AS TO SILENCE WE STARTED BACK TO SUNNYSIDE
HALSEY GERTRUDE PROBABLY HAD YOUR REVOLVER
HE MUST BE IN MR BAILEY'S ROOM I SAID EXCITEDLY AND FOLLOWED BY LIDDY WE WENT THERE
IF WE COULD FIND THE WOMAN WE MIGHT FIND WHAT HAD BECOME OF HALSEY
THE SIDING HOWEVER WAS EMPTY
BUT THE STAIRS IN THAT WING OFFERED SOMETHING
SHE WAS IN DEEP MOURNING AND KEPT HER VEIL DOWN AND SHE BROUGHT FOR EXAMINATION A CHILD A BOY OF SIX
BUT HE SAID TO KEEP ON HOPING THAT IT WAS THE BEST NEWS WE HAD HAD
THE MAIDS ROOMS TRUNK-ROOM AND VARIOUS STORE-ROOMS INCLUDING A LARGE AIRY LINEN-ROOM OPENED FROM A LONG CORRIDOR LIKE THAT ON THE SECOND FLOOR
IT WAS THE ONLY THING HE COULD DO TRUDE HE SAID AT LAST
TAIN'T ONE THING AN TAIN'T ANOTHER--IT'S JEST A DOOR SQUEALIN HERE AN A WINDER CLOSIN THERE BUT WHEN DOORS AN WINDERS GETS TO CUTTIN UP CAPERS AND THERE'S NOBODY NIGH EM IT'S TIME THOMAS JOHNSON SLEEPS SOMEWHAR'S ELSE LIDDY WHO SEEMED TO BE NEVER MORE THAN TEN FEET AWAY FROM ME THAT NIGHT AND WAS AFRAID OF HER SHADOW IN THAT GREAT BARN OF A PLACE SCREAMED A LITTLE AND TURNED A YELLOW-GREEN
MORE THAN THAT WITH THINGS HAPPENING EVERY DAY I CONSIDER IT MY DUTY
I HAVE NEVER BEEN A NERVOUS WOMAN AS I SAID BEFORE
IF YOU WILL SHOW ME THE ELECTRIC SWITCH MISS INNES YOU WOULD BETTER WAIT IN YOUR OWN ROOM TREMBLING AS I WAS I WAS DETERMINED TO SEE THAT DOOR OPENED
WE MAY FOR INSTANCE COME BACK TO THE FIGURE ON THE PORCH
SHE GAVE LUCIEN A HANDKERCHIEF AND FORGOT IT
IT LOOKS AS IF BAILEY WHOM SHE HAS TRIED SO HARD TO SAVE IS WORSE THAN A RASCAL
I WAS GREETED BY A SERIES OF LOW SCREAMS AND QUESTIONS AND I TRIED TO QUIET THEM
FIRST THING I KNEW I GOT A LETTER FROM HIM IN THE WEST
THE ARCHITECT THAT PUT UP THIS JOINT WAS WISE TO A FEW THINGS
THREE DOLLARS A WEEK INCLUDING HIS WASHING VERY WELL I SAID
PLEASE DO NOT MENTION THEM TO HER HE LOOKED AS SURPRISED AS A MEDICAL MAN EVER DOES
AND WHEN BEULAH MY CAT A MOST INTELLIGENT ANIMAL FOUND SOME EARLY CATNIP ON A BANK NEAR THE HOUSE AND ROLLED IN IT IN A FELINE ECSTASY I DECIDED THAT GETTING BACK TO NATURE WAS THE THING TO DO
WHAT HE SAID WAS NOT A SURPRISE
I HAD TO TAKE LIDDY TO HER ROOM UP-STAIRS HOWEVER,--SHE WAS QUITE SURE SHE WOULD FIND SOMETHING UNCANNY
THE MEETING BETWEEN BROTHER AND SISTER WAS TENSE BUT WITHOUT TEARS
THE OUTER DOOR WAS CLOSED AND LOCKED AND THE STAIRCASE CURVED ABOVE US FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE ANY OTHER STAIRCASE
WE THOUGHT THE WEDDING WAS TO OCCUR SOON
SHE HAD ELOQUENT BROWN EYES--THE INNESES ARE FAIR AND ARE PRONE TO A GRAYISH-GREEN OPTIC THAT IS BETTER FOR USE THAN APPEARANCE--AND THEY SEEMED NOW TO BE CLOUDED WITH TROUBLE
IT WAS VERY DARK EVERYWHERE BUT OF COURSE I KNEW MY WAY
THE HOUSE WAS HEATED BY STEAM AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE
ISN'T THAT THE ACT OF AN INNOCENT MAN THEN WHY DID HE LEAVE AT ALL I ASKED UNCONVINCED
HAD MR HALSEY ANY POSSIBLE REASON FOR GOING AWAY LIKE THIS WITHOUT WARNING NONE WHATEVER HE WENT AWAY ONCE BEFORE HE PERSISTED
I LISTENED TO HER RETREATING FOOTSTEPS AND AS SOON AS SHE WAS SAFELY BELOW STAIRS I WENT UP TO THE TRUNK-ROOM
LOUISE WAS STILL UNCONSCIOUS BUT SHE WAS BREATHING BETTER AND I SUGGESTED THAT WE GET HER BACK TO BED BEFORE SHE CAME TO
WHEN I HAD GATHERED UP MY NERVES AGAIN I FOUND IT HAD BEEN THE BULB OF A SWINGING ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ACCIDENT I MIGHT HAVE STARVED TO DEATH IN AN ILLUMINATED SEPULCHER
ONE RATHER FELT THAN HEARD IT AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOCATE
MISS ARMSTRONG IS GOING TO MARRY MY NEPHEW THE DOCTOR SMILED AS HE PICKED UP THE REINS
THINGS WERE HAPPENING OF COURSE ALL THE TIME BUT THEY MADE LITTLE OR NO IMPRESSION
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A GHOST UP HERE AND THAT YOU HAVE THE HOUSE FILLED WITH DETECTIVES TO EXORCISE IT HE SAID
MISS INNES HE SAID I AM IN A PECULIAR POSITION
HE JUMPED THROUGH THE OPENING INTO THE SECRET ROOM AND PICKED UP THE PORTABLE SAFE
OF COURSE WE TOOK THE PLACE
THEN I STOOD AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER WHERE SHE CROUCHED TREMBLINGLY AGAINST THE DOORWAY
IT'S--IT BELONGS TO THOMAS HE SAID AND FLED UP THE DRIVE
HE SAYS THAT ON THE THURSDAY NIGHT BEFORE ABOUT EIGHT-THIRTY BAILEY WENT BACK TO THE BANK
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOT ARNOLD ARMSTRONG AS A BURGLAR AND THEN FLED FRIGHTENED AT WHAT HE HAD DONE
I PUT MY ARMS AROUND MY BOY AND FOR A MOMENT HE HAD TO SUPPORT ME
CHAPTER VIII THE OTHER HALF OF THE LINE MISS INNES THE DETECTIVE BEGAN WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THE FIGURE YOU SAW ON THE EAST VERANDA THE NIGHT YOU AND YOUR MAID WERE IN THE HOUSE ALONE IT WAS A WOMAN I SAID POSITIVELY
I FOLLOWED HIM MORE SLOWLY
USE EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS TO HAVE SUNNYSIDE VACATED
I SEEMED TO SEE A NETWORK CLOSING AROUND MY BOY INNOCENT AS I KNEW HE WAS
THE KEY TO THE EAST ENTRY MADE THIS A POSSIBILITY
WILL YOU PARDON ME FOR A PERSONAL QUESTION THE DETECTIVE WAS A YOUNGISH MAN AND I THOUGHT HE WAS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED
I REPRESENTED TO THOMAS THAT WE WERE ALONE AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO STAY IN THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT
NOT ONLY THAT BUT THERE IS EVERY EVIDENCE THAT HE HAS BEEN EITHER ABDUCTED OR I COULD NOT FINISH
LIDDY WAS ON THE POINT OF RETREAT
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT IT WAS THAT MADE YOUR NEPHEW AND MR BAILEY LEAVE THEIR CIGARS AND THEIR GAME TAKE OUT THE AUTOMOBILE WITHOUT CALLING THE CHAUFFEUR AND ALL THIS AT--LET ME SEE CERTAINLY BEFORE THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I DON'T KNOW I SAID
THEY SAY THAT THEY DISTINCTLY HEARD THE SHOCK WHEN THE DRAGON FLY HIT THE CAR AND THEY WENT TO THE BOTTOM OF THEIR GARDEN AND LOOKED OVER
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS I MUST TELL YOU SHE INSISTED
LOUISE ROSE AND STOOD WATCHING HER HAND TO HER THROAT
I PROMISED TO LOOK AFTER LITTLE LUCIEN AND SAT WITH HER UNTIL THE INTERVALS OF CONSCIOUSNESS GREW SHORTER AND FINALLY CEASED ALTOGETHER
WHY SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHICH OF THE THREE WAS LUCIEN
IT WOULD COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE LIDDY LOOKED AT THE KEYHOLE
ALL THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF MATERNITY WERE THRUST UPON ME SUDDENLY
SOMEBODY--HAD IT SHE ASKED
I FOUND IT IN THE LINEN HAMPER SHE SAID
I ALWAYS SAID THERE WERE PLENTY OF THINGS GOING ON HERE RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES THAT WE COULDN'T SEE SHE SAID HOLDING OUT HER APRON
IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG-HANDLED SPADES
MY HOME IS IN ENGLEWOOD TWO MILES FROM CASANOVA THE DOCTOR BEGAN
AT FIRST I FOUND NOTHING
WHO HAD PASSED LOUISE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
IT WAS NOT MUCH OF AN INJURY BUT IT HAD BLED FREELY AND HIS APPEARANCE WAS RATHER TERRIFYING
POOR AUNTY SHE SAID
ALEX WAS AWAKE AND RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRS AND IN FIVE MINUTES FROM THE TIME THE FIRE WAS DISCOVERED THREE OF THE MAIDS WERE SITTING ON THEIR TRUNKS IN THE DRIVE ALTHOUGH EXCEPTING A FEW SPARKS THERE WAS NO FIRE NEARER THAN A HUNDRED YARDS
SO IT WAS ALEX JACK BAILEY WHO HAD BEEN OUR GHOST
ONE MAN IN THAT BARN OF A HOUSE WAS AN ABSURDITY WITH THINGS HAPPENING ALL THE TIME AND I MUST SAY THAT ALEX WAS AS UNOBJECTIONABLE AS ANY ONE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN
ALLOWING FOR MY NERVES AND THE FACT THAT SMALL NOISES MAGNIFY THEMSELVES AT NIGHT THERE WAS STILL NO POSSIBILITY THAT THE PICTURE HAD MADE THE SERIES OF SOUNDS I HEARD
FOR TRY AS WE WOULD OUR THOUGHTS ALWAYS CAME BACK TO THAT FATAL SATURDAY NIGHT AND THE MURDER
OR MR INNES EXPLANATION MAY TURN US IN A NEW DIRECTION
WHEN HE SAW THAT MY ASSAILANT DROPPED ME WITH A CURSE
I BELIEVE YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE HORRIBLE THING THIS MYSTERY THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH
ARNOLD ARMSTRONG HAD BEEN FOUND DEAD AT THE FOOT OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE AT THREE O'CLOCK ON SUNDAY MORNING
WHOEVER HAD TAKEN REFUGE AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS COULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THE HOUSE OR WITH THE LOCATION OF THE CHUTE
HE WAS DISAGREEABLE WHICH IS UNLIKE HIM NERVOUS LOOKING AT HIS WATCH EVERY FEW MINUTES AND HE ATE ALMOST NOTHING
MR JARVIS TOOK THE LAMP FROM ME--I REMEMBER THAT--AND THEN FEELING MYSELF GETTING DIZZY AND LIGHT-HEADED I CLOSED MY EYES
YOUR THEORY IS THAT MR ARMSTRONG WAS FOLLOWED HERE BY SOME ENEMY AND SHOT AS HE ENTERED THE HOUSE I DON'T THINK I HAVE A THEORY I SAID
HER RETICENCE WAS A PART OF A ROLE SHE HAD ASSUMED
I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME LIDDY I SAID
FOR THREE DAYS HALSEY LAY IN THE BOX CAR TIED HAND AND FOOT SUFFERING TORTURES OF THIRST DELIRIOUS AT TIMES AND DISCOVERED BY A TRAMP AT JOHNSVILLE ONLY IN TIME TO SAVE HIS LIFE
THERE WERE NO VOICES AND I HEARD NOTHING
AFTER A WHILE HE WENT TO THE HOUSE AND BROUGHT MRS WATSON AND THEY TALKED UNTIL LATE
GERTRUDE SPENT MUCH OF HER TIME WANDERING THROUGH THE GROUNDS OR TAKING LONG CROSS-COUNTRY WALKS
THEY ARE NOT TOGETHER SHE SAID HOTLY
AS I WAS FINALLY GETTING READY FOR BED HALSEY CAME UP-STAIRS AND KNOCKED AT MY DOOR
YOU ARE SURE YES I SAID
HE WAS NOT LONG IN DOUBT
SHE SEEMED INDIFFERENT REFUSED TO DISCUSS MATTERS PERTAINING TO THE BANK AND NEVER TO MY KNOWLEDGE EITHER WROTE TO HIM OR WENT TO SEE HIM
IT MUST HAVE BEEN AFTER ELEVEN AND THE MONOTONOUS TICK OF THE BIG CLOCK ON THE STAIRS BEHIND ME WAS THE ONLY SOUND
WHEN A HAND YOU CAN'T SEE PUTS YER LIGHT OUT IT MEANS DEATH SURE THE OLD MAN'S VOICE WAS FULL OF CONVICTION
IF IT IS THIS HOUSE IT MAY MEAN ANYTHING FROM A SECRET ROOM TO AN EXTRA BATH-ROOM I SAID SCORNFULLY
I WAS NOT IN IT AND NO AMOUNT OF PRESSING ON THE CARVING OF THE WOODEN MANTELS NO SEARCH OF THE FLOORS FOR LOOSE BOARDS NONE OF THE CUSTOMARY METHODS AVAILED AT ALL
LIDDY WHO WAS TAKING MRS WATSON'S PLACE HAD FINISHED EXAMINING THE TEA-TOWELS AND THE CORNERS OF THE SHELVES IN THE COOLING-ROOM AND HAD GONE TO BED
OUR NERVES WERE NOT WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND GERTRUDE ALWAYS APPREHENSIVE LATELY WAS AT THE DOOR ALMOST INSTANTLY
IT HAD BEEN ANYTHING BUT A JOKE TO US
HALSEY BOUGHT A CAR OF COURSE AND I LEARNED HOW TO TIE OVER MY BONNET A GRAY BAIZE VEIL AND AFTER A TIME NEVER TO STOP TO LOOK AT THE DOGS ONE HAS RUN DOWN
THE EFFECT WAS COOL AND SPACIOUS BUT SCARCELY COZY
HIS UNEXPLAINED ABSENCE FROM THE BANK ON MONDAY LENT COLOR TO THE SUSPICION AGAINST HIM
AND HALF OF THEM WILL STRETCH A POINT OR TWO AS TO FACTS TO BE OBLIGING
ANYHOW BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT GERTRUDE WAS ON HER WAY TO JOHNSVILLE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILES AWAY ACCOMPANIED BY ROSIE
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE I WENT AUNT RAY HE SAID AFTER A MOMENT
IN THE CENTER WAS A SMALL RUBY
AT TWO O'CLOCK TWO-FIFTEEN ROSIE INSISTED SHE HAD GONE UP-STAIRS TO GET A PICTURE FROM HER ROOM TO SHOW MARY ANNE
THE MADDENING THING HOWEVER WAS THAT THE NIGHTLY VISITOR HAD EVIDENTLY MORE THAN ONE WAY OF GAINING ACCESS TO THE HOUSE AND WE MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO REDOUBLE OUR VIGILANCE AS TO WINDOWS AND DOORS THAT NIGHT
I HAVE BEEN TO THE CLUB-HOUSE HE SAID AND AMONG MR ARMSTRONG'S EFFECTS I FOUND THESE
I WONDERED IF THOMAS COULD HAVE HELPED US TO FIND HALSEY HAD HE LIVED
THE DOCTOR SNIFFED IT
LIDDY HAD COME BACK TO THE KITCHEN
I THOUGHT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HALSEY COMING HOME
WE HAD BEEN SO ENGROSSED THAT I HAD LEFT THIS POOR CREATURE TO DIE WITHOUT EVEN A WORD OF SYMPATHY
AND GRADUALLY HALSEY'S BOYISH FEATURES LOST THEIR GLOW AT SEEING HER ABOUT AGAIN AND SETTLED INTO GRIM LINES
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF ITS TRUTH AND THE THING THAT MADE IT INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL TO ME WAS THAT THE POOR GIRL HAD CREPT DOWN TO ANSWER THE SUMMONS OF A BROTHER WHO WOULD NEVER NEED HER KINDLY OFFICES AGAIN
NOW MISS INNES HERE IS THE STRANGE PART OF THAT
IN OTHER WORDS I BELIEVE THE MURDERER STOOD ON THE STAIRS AND FIRED DOWN
LIDDY ALLEN I SAID STOP COMBING THAT SWITCH AND TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU LIDDY HEAVED A SIGH
IT HAD BEEN DONE QUIETLY AND WITH DELIBERATE PURPOSE
IN HIS OWN HOME TOO I STARED AT HIM WITHOUT COMPREHENSION
THE SMALL CARD-ROOM SEEMED UNDISTURBED
I FELT ALONG FOR THE STAIR-RAIL AND WENT DOWN AS QUICKLY AS I COULD
THE MEN EXCHANGED SIGNIFICANT GLANCES AND WARNER GOT A LANTERN
THE ARMSTRONGS LEFT FOR CALIFORNIA AND ARNOLD'S PERSECUTIONS BEGAN ANEW
NO MA'M INDIGNANTLY
I FOUND HIM TRYING TO SELL THIS WATCH HE TOOK A WATCH FROM HIS POCKET AND PUT IT ON THE TABLE
LET ME SEE
AT THE FOOT OF THE DRIVE THE ROAD DESCRIBED A LONG SLOPING HORSESHOE-SHAPED CURVE AROUND THE LODGE
BUT NOT SO SOON HE REPLIED
IT HAD BEEN LIFTED ON TO THE BILLIARD-TABLE AND A SHEET THROWN OVER IT
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
HE WAS RATHER SKEPTICAL
I HAD NEGLECTED TO REMOVE MY WRINKLE ERADICATORS AND I PRESUME MY APPEARANCE WAS ODD
NOW WE ARE GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS
SO SHE SLEP IN THE HOUSE
THEN HE TURNED AND LOOKED AT ME
IN FACT WHEN SHE DID NOT HAVING NOW THE COURAGE OF DAYLIGHT SHE WAS ACTUALLY DISAPPOINTED
THE BOY KNOWS A WORD OR TWO OF GERMAN BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE LIVED OR ANYTHING ABOUT HIMSELF MR JAMIESON WROTE SOMETHING ON A CARD AND GAVE IT TO HER
A TRAMP WASHING A DIRTY SHIRT PRESUMABLY BLOODY IN THE CREEK BELOW THE BRIDGE I COULD SEE THE GLEAM OF MR JAMIESON'S TEETH AS HE SMILED
HE DENIED THE WHOLE THING AND SHE WENT TO HALSEY
ARNOLD ARMSTRONG CAME HERE AT TWO-THIRTY--CAME INTO THE BILLIARD-ROOM AND LEFT IN FIVE MINUTES
ONLY WHEN WE HAD CLOSED THE FRONT DOOR AND STOOD FACING EACH OTHER IN THE HALL DID HALSEY SAY ANYTHING
MIS WATSON SHE'VE BIN HERE A GOOD WHILE AN SHE WARN SKEERY
I WAS IN A PARALYSIS OF TERROR
MY NERVES WERE GOING ANYHOW THERE IN THE DARK AND I COULD SCARCELY STAND
WE GOT TO THE DOOR SOMEHOW AND LIDDY HELD A BRASS ANDIRON WHICH IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO LIFT LET ALONE BRAIN ANYBODY WITH
THERE WAS A BAND DRAWN TIGHT AROUND MY THROAT
I WENT UP-STAIRS AT LAST TIRED AND DEPRESSED
SHE SENT FOR ME BEFORE SHE WENT AND I SAW SHE HAD BEEN CRYING
THERE IS NO ONE GUARDING THE DOOR DOWN THERE I EXPLAINED
WHAT WERE YOUR REASONS FOR THINKING THAT I HESITATED
IT WAS FILLED WITH GOLD-TOPPED BOTTLES AND BRUSHES AND IT BREATHED OPULENCE LUXURY FEMININITY FROM EVERY INCH OF SURFACE
THEN WITH THE RELIEF OF SPACE BETWEEN US I SCREAMED EAR-SPLITTINGLY MADLY AND THEY HEARD ME OUTSIDE
MISS RACHEL YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THIS HOUSE IS HAUNTED
HE WAS GRAVE AND QUIET AND HE NODDED COMPREHENDINGLY WHEN HE SAW THE SAFE
I COULD DISTINCTLY HEAR FOOTSTEPS
I FELT NOTHING BUT A SPLINTERY SURFACE OF BOARDS AND IN ENDEAVORING TO GET BACK TO THE CHAIR SOMETHING STRUCK ME FULL IN THE FACE AND FELL WITH THE NOISE OF A THOUSAND EXPLOSIONS TO THE GROUND
I DROPPED MY PRETENSE AT KNITTING AND LEANING BACK I THOUGHT OVER THE LAST FORTY-EIGHT HOURS
WILL YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION CERTAINLY
I DON'T THINK HE KNEW DOCTOR WALKER AT ALL AND--THEIR RELATIONS COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN CORDIAL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES JAMIESON PRICKED UP HIS EARS AND LITTLE BY LITTLE HE DREW FROM US THE UNFORTUNATE STORY OF HALSEY'S LOVE AFFAIR AND THE FACT THAT LOUISE WAS GOING TO MARRY DOCTOR WALKER
THE MAN I HAD MET IN THE DARKNESS HAD BEEN EVEN MORE STARTLED THAN I AND ABOUT HIS VOICE WHEN HE MUTTERED HIS MUFFLED EXCLAMATION THERE WAS SOMETHING VAGUELY FAMILIAR
HE REFUSED DESSERT AND LEFT THE TABLE EARLY EXCUSING HIMSELF ON THE GROUND THAT HE WANTED TO SEE ALEX
WHERE IS WARNER I ASKED
APPARENTLY NOTHING OCCURRED
WINTERS THE DETECTIVE WHO WATCHED THE HOUSE AT NIGHT FOLLOWED THEM AND KEPT HIS EYES SHARPLY ON ALEX'S PRISONER
THE THOUGHT THAT THE DETECTIVE WOULD BE THERE THAT NIGHT WAS THE MOST CHEERING THING OF ALL AND I THINK EVEN GERTRUDE WAS GLAD OF IT
THE LATHING WAS MORE OBSTINATE
HALSEY IS NOT HERE
ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION THE TRAMP HAD BEEN POUNDING HIS EAR"--THIS STUCK TO ME AS BEING GRAPHIC--IN AN EMPTY BOX-CAR ALONG THE SIDING AT CASANOVA
IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN I FINALLY PREPARED FOR BED
HE STOOD FOR A SECOND LISTENING THEN--HE MADE ANOTHER RUSH AND I STRUCK OUT WITH MY WEAPON
IF THOMAS HAD SUSPECTED HE HAD NEVER TOLD
AND MARY ANNE SAID THAT LAST NIGHT THERE WAS A MAN STANDING BY THE STABLE WHEN SHE LOCKED THE KITCHEN DOOR MARY ANNE WAS A FOOL I SAID STERNLY
SO WE SIT AND TALK AND SOMETIMES LIDDY THREATENS TO LEAVE AND OFTEN I DISCHARGE HER BUT WE STAY TOGETHER SOMEHOW
EACH MAN WAS ARMED AND AS AN ADDITIONAL PRECAUTION THE ONE OFF DUTY SLEPT IN A ROOM NEAR THE HEAD OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE AND KEPT HIS DOOR OPEN TO BE READY FOR EMERGENCY
IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO ONE BAILEY HAD SENT AND IT SAID THAT PAUL ARMSTRONG WAS VERY ILL
FOR ONE NIGHT HOWEVER MR JAMIESON PREFERRED TO WATCH ALONE
MISS GERTRUDE INNES TESTIFIED THAT SHE HEARD SOME ONE FUMBLING WITH THE LOCK THAT THE DOOR OPENED AND THAT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE SHOT WAS FIRED
AFTER A LITTLE I JOINED HIM IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM AND TOGETHER WE WENT OVER THE DETAILS OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE BODY
WHATEVER THE RAPPINGS HAVE BEEN--AND THE COLORED MAN SAYS THEY BEGAN WHEN THE FAMILY WENT WEST THREE MONTHS AGO--THEY ARE LIKELY TO STOP NOW WHICH SHOWS HOW MUCH HE KNEW ABOUT IT
I HAD FOUND NOTHING TO CHANGE MY IMPRESSION OF HIS GUILT AND GERTRUDE KNEW HOW I FELT
THEY WENT DIRECTLY TO THAT LITTLE YELLOW HOUSE NEXT TO DOCTOR WALKER'S AND ARE APPARENTLY SETTLED THERE
SHE WAS TALKIN IN HER SLEEP SOMETHING AWFUL--ABOUT DEAD MEN AND COFFINS LIDDY I SAID STERNLY DID YOU BREATHE A WORD ABOUT EVERYTHING NOT BEING RIGHT HERE LIDDY'S GAZE HAD WANDERED TO THE DOOR OF THE CHUTE NOW BOLTED SECURELY
PAST THE EAST ENTRANCE WHERE SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE THE MOST OBSTINATE EFFORT HAD BEEN MADE TO ENTER THE HOUSE AND WHERE THAT NIGHT TWO WEEKS AGO LIDDY AND I HAD SEEN THE STRANGE WOMAN
VETERAN OF THE WAR ONE ARM
THEN SHE LEFT ME
IT MUST BE MR HALSEY'S BUT IT SEEMS QUEER HOW IT GOT THERE IT WAS THE HALF OF A LINK CUFF-BUTTON OF UNIQUE DESIGN AND I LOOKED AT IT CAREFULLY
I DO NOT BELIEVE ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS THE MIDNIGHT VISITOR WHO SO ALARMED YOU BY DROPPING--SHALL WE SAY A GOLF-STICK
LIDDY BEGAN TO MOAN UNDER HER BREATH AND IN MY EXCITEMENT I REACHED DOWN AND SHOOK HER
THE DETECTIVE'S ABSENCE WAS HARDLY REASSURING
WE WERE JOINED AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES BY ANOTHER MAN WHO FELL INTO STEP WITH THE DOCTOR SILENTLY
IN OTHER WORDS THE EVIDENCE POINTS ABSOLUTELY TO THIS
EVER SINCE YOU HAVE COME HERE THERE HAVE BEEN HOSTILE DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
THE CARD-ROOM AND BILLIARD-ROOM WERE IN DARKNESS
THEN SHE SEEMED TO MAKE UP HER MIND
IT WAS VAGUE INDEFINITE
SHE HAD APPLIED FOR THE POSITION OF HOUSEKEEPER AND SECURED IT
THERE IS HARDLY ANY WATER IN IT
EVERY ONE CONNECTED WITH THE BANK HAD BEEN PLACED UNDER ARREST AND RELEASED ON HEAVY BOND
I FELL OVER THE CARRIAGE BLOCK SHE EXPLAINED
THEN IT CEASED
AT HALF-PAST TWO THE DOWNSTAIRS TELEPHONE RANG
HIS PURSUERS WERE PLAINLY BAFFLED
THE POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION SHOWED THAT THE BULLET HAD ENTERED THE CHEST IN THE FOURTH LEFT INTERCOSTAL SPACE AND HAD TAKEN AN OBLIQUE COURSE DOWNWARD AND BACKWARD PIERCING BOTH THE HEART AND LUNGS
THE HALL SAVE FOR ITS NIGHT LAMP WAS IN DARKNESS AS I WENT ACROSS TO HALSEY'S ROOM
THE PEACE OF THE COUNTRY--FIDDLE STICKS WHEREUPON I TOLD GERTRUDE OF THE NOISES THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE FIGURE ON THE VERANDA IN THE EAST WING
IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE I COULD PERSUADE HER SHE HAD NOT BEEN ATTACKED FROM BEHIND BY A BURGLAR AND WHEN SHE FOUND THE MIRROR SMASHED ON THE FLOOR SHE WASN'T MUCH BETTER
THEN HE LIGHTED A MATCH
WE WERE ON THE EDGE OF THE CASANOVA CHURCHYARD
BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO STRANGE WOMAN NEAR THE HOUSE OR LIDDY WOULD HAVE SEEN HER YOU MAY BE SURE
HE CAME AT ONCE TO THE DOOR OF HIS CONSULTING-ROOM AND THERE WAS NO MASK OF CORDIALITY IN HIS MANNER
OF THAT STORY OF THOMAS ABOUT SEEING JACK BAILEY IN THE FOOTPATH BETWEEN THE CLUB AND SUNNYSIDE THE NIGHT LIDDY AND I HEARD THE NOISE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE--THAT TOO WAS RIGHT
IT WILL BE A GOOD THING IF SHE HAS
I MUST SAY FOR ALL ALEX'S ANXIETY TO SET ME FREE HE PAID LITTLE ENOUGH ATTENTION TO MY PLIGHT
BUT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT
HE HAS KILLED HIM SHE MUTTERED ALMOST INARTICULATELY
WAS NOT A FANCY COOK BUT COULD MAKE GOOD SOUPS AND DESSERTS IF THERE WAS ANY ONE TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE SALADS
IS KING'S A CHILDREN'S OUTFITTING PLACE HE ASKED
BUT CASANOVA HAD NO LAME MEN
I HAD THREE CHILDREN OF MY OWN AND ONE MORE DIDN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE WORK BUT--I WISH SHE WOULD PAY THIS WEEK'S BOARD DID SHE SAY WHAT STORE IT WAS NO SIR BUT ALL THE BOY'S CLOTHES CAME FROM KING'S
WHEREVER POSSIBLE ON THE FIRST FLOOR THE ARCHITECT HAD DONE AWAY WITH PARTITIONS USING ARCHES AND COLUMNS INSTEAD
DYING
THE MACHINE WAS TEMPORARILY OUT OF COMMISSION AND THE CARRIAGE HORSES HAD BEEN SENT TO A FARM FOR THE SUMMER
HE SET THE INQUEST FOR THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY GAVE MR JAMIESON THE YOUNGER OF THE TWO DETECTIVES AND THE MORE INTELLIGENT LOOKING A FEW INSTRUCTIONS AND AFTER GRAVELY SHAKING HANDS WITH ME AND REGRETTING THE UNFORTUNATE AFFAIR TOOK HIS DEPARTURE ACCOMPANIED BY THE OTHER DETECTIVE
IT WAS A SMALL WHITE HOUSE DILAPIDATED WITHOUT HAVING GAINED ANYTHING PICTURESQUE WITH A LOW WINDOW AND A PORCH ONLY A FOOT OR SO ABOVE THE BIT OF A LAWN
I WENT BACK AT ONCE TO THE TRUNK-ROOM AND SITTING DOWN ON A BOX I GAVE MY MIND AS CONSISTENTLY AS I COULD TO THE PROBLEM BEFORE ME
LIDDY CAME TO MY ROOM ON SUNDAY MORNING WITH A FACE AS LONG AS THE MORAL LAW
MY OWN FAMILY IS IMPLICATED NOW AND I SHALL DO EVERYTHING TO CLEAR THE MYSTERY OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG'S MURDER THE DOCTOR STOOD LOOKING DOWN SLAPPING HIS GLOVES THOUGHTFULLY AGAINST THE PALM OF A WELL-LOOKED-AFTER HAND
I HAD NO DOUBT THE SEARCH FOR ME WOULD NOW COME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND AFTER A LITTLE I DROPPED INTO A DOZE
WHAT INNOCENT MAN WOULD RUN AWAY FROM HERE AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
I HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT PERHAPS ALEX WAS A SPY AND THAT BY TAKING HIM INTO THE HOUSE I HAD PLAYED INTO THE ENEMY'S HAND
THE TWO MEN WENT TO THE BILLIARD-ROOM AND I COULD HEAR THEM TALKING AS I WENT UP-STAIRS
I SHALL STAY RIGHT HERE I SAID AND CROSSING THE SMALL VERANDA NOW SHADED AND FRAGRANT WITH HONEYSUCKLE I HAMMERED THE KNOCKER ON THE DOOR
AT THAT TIME HAD YOU ANY SUSPICION THAT THE TRADERS BANK HAD BEEN WRECKED NO WHAT OCCURRED NEXT MR BAILEY AND I TALKED IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM UNTIL TWO-THIRTY AND MR ARNOLD ARMSTRONG CAME THERE WHILE YOU WERE TALKING YES
AND WHILE DOCTOR STEWART WHISKED THE EGGS HE TALKED
SIT DOWN I SAID GRIMLY
YOU MUST WONDER HOW I CAME HERE AND WHY I STAYED HIDDEN AT THE LODGE
I HURRIED INTO THE NEXT ROOM
SHE HAS WANTED IT FOR THREE YEARS AND SHE WAS QUITE UGLY THE TIME I SPILLED COFFEE ON IT
STRANGE ENOUGH IT MUST HAVE SEEMED TO HALSEY TOO TO COME ACROSS ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH THE SKIRT OF MY GRAY SILK GOWN OVER MY SHOULDERS TO KEEP OFF THE DEW HOLDING A RED AND GREEN BASKET UNDER ONE ARM AND A BLACK CAT UNDER THE OTHER
THERE WAS A BABY-CARRIAGE IN THE PATH AND FROM A SWING AT THE SIDE CAME THE SOUND OF CONFLICT
I AM VIOLATING PROFESSIONAL ETHICS WHEN I TELL YOU EVEN AS MUCH AS THAT I COULD NOT TELL HIM HE LIED
NOW THEN I SAID WHEN WE GOT OUTSIDE WILL YOU TELL ME WHY YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE ALEX INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE
THE CHANCES ARE AGAINST FLIGHT
THEN AUTOMATICALLY I GOT THE LAUDANUM AND WENT BACK TO HER
MRS FITZHUGH HAD FOUND THE MESSAGE
HALSEY SPENT PART OF THE DAY WITH MR JAMIESON BUT HE SAID NOTHING OF WHAT HAPPENED
IT WAS THE ENGINE OF THE AUTOMOBILE AND HALSEY HAD COME BACK
WARNER DROVE ME
I THOUGHT I HEARD SOME ONE SHRIEK
EVERYTHING WAS IN GOOD ORDER AND REPAIR
HALSEY WAS INCLINED TO POOH-POOH THE WHOLE AFFAIR
I KNOW THE VERY FELLOW I RECORD THIS SCRAP OF CONVERSATION JUST AS I HAVE TRIED TO PUT DOWN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT HAD A BEARING ON WHAT FOLLOWED BECAUSE THE GARDENER HALSEY SENT THE NEXT DAY PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE EVENTS OF THE NEXT FEW WEEKS--EVENTS THAT CULMINATED AS YOU KNOW BY STIRRING THE COUNTRY PROFOUNDLY
HUDDLED THERE ON THE FLOOR FACE DOWN WITH HIS ARMS EXTENDED WAS A MAN
THERE WILL BE TWO WEDDINGS BEFORE LONG AND LIDDY HAS ASKED FOR MY HELIOTROPE POPLIN TO WEAR TO THE CHURCH
SOME ONE HAD PUT A KEY INTO THE LOCK AND WAS TURNING IT
OUR MAN HAD GONE AND THE LARGE AND EXPENSIVE STABLE AT SUNNYSIDE WAS A HEAP OF SMOKING RAFTERS AND CHARRED BOARDS
HE SECURED ARNOLD'S KEYS FROM HIS ROOM AT THE CLUB AND GOT INTO THE HOUSE ARMED WITH A GOLF-STICK FOR SOUNDING THE WALLS
IT WAS WEDNESDAY I HAD MY INTERVIEW WITH HER
IT'S A PLACE FOR A WOMAN SAH THINGS WERE NOT TURNING OUT THE WAY HALSEY EXPECTED
THE FACT IS HE WENT ON EVIDENTLY JUSTIFYING HIM SELF I GOT THAT PIECE OF INFORMATION JUST AS WE GET A LOT OF THINGS THROUGH THE KITCHEN END OF THE HOUSE
YOU SEE IT WERE LIKE THIS
MRS TATE HE SAID I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING
CHAPTER XIV AN EGG-NOG AND A TELEGRAM WE HAD DISCOVERED LOUISE AT THE LODGE TUESDAY NIGHT
THE BOLT WAS ON MY SIDE AND I PUSHED IT FORWARD
THE LEFT LUNG WAS COLLAPSED AND THE EXIT POINT OF THE BALL HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK TO THE LEFT OF THE SPINAL COLUMN
MR BAILEY WAS TO MEET HIM AT THE FOOT OF THE LAWN
HE HAS NOT COME BACK SHE ASKED LOOKING FROM ME TO GERTRUDE
OUTSIDE ON THE ROAD HE FOUND THE WATCH
SHE DIDN'T COME OUT THAT NIGHT AT ALL
THE PLAN OF THE UPPER STORY OF THE HOUSE WAS LIKE THAT OF THE SECOND FLOOR IN THE MAIN
SCARCELY EITHER
THEN ROSIE'S STORY WAS TRUE
PROBABLY HOME IN DAY OR SO
IT WAS GERTRUDE GOING BACK QUICKLY TOWARD THE HOUSE
GONE HE SAID
THE DOCTOR WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE HOUSE WAS GUARDED DAY AND NIGHT
I HAD THE BLANKET OVER MY ARM
BUT I DETERMINED THAT BEFORE THE DAY WAS OVER SHE MUST KNOW THE TRUE STATE OF AFFAIRS
HE LEFT HERE ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER EIGHT MR JAMIESON SAID
I AM SORRY YOU ARE SO ILL THE OLD MAN STOOD STARING AT ME AND THEN AT THE BLANKET
THE REACTION FROM THE SHOCK AND STRAIN WAS TREMENDOUS
WHO HAD FALLEN DOWN THE CLOTHES CHUTE
IT WAS THE OTHER HALF OF THE PEARL CUFF-LINK
I WAS HUNTING AROUND FOR COTTON AND LAUDANUM
HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A LIVERY HORSE AND THE LIVERYMAN SAID HE HAD BOUGHT HIM FROM THE ARMSTRONGS WHEN THEY PURCHASED A COUPLE OF MOTORS AND CUT DOWN THE STABLE
THEN I WENT TO THE STABLES WHERE I KEPT MY CAR AND GOT IT OUT LEAVING MR BAILEY ALONE IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM HALSEY HESITATED
MRS TATE SAT UNEASILY HER HANDS FOLDED IN HER LAP
HE HEARD ME THROUGH WITHOUT SPEAKING
ROSIE HAD BEEN AT THE LODGE
WHY DID THEY GO AWAY I AM ONLY TELLING YOU WHAT HAPPENED NOT WHY IT HAPPENED SHE SAID EVENLY
THE PRODIGAL HAS COME HOME MISS INNES HE SAID
AN AUTOMOBILE HAD STRUCK THE CAR AND STOOD THERE ON TWO WHEELS
I THINK I WILL HAVE TO BE HONEST AND GIVE YOU BACK YOUR MONEY WHY I ASKED
DON'T DARE TO TELL ME THE SOAP IS OUT NO MA'M MISS INNES SHE HAD A NERVOUS HABIT OF LOOKING FIRST AT MY ONE EYE AND THEN AT THE OTHER HER OWN OPTICS SHIFTING CEASELESSLY RIGHT EYE LEFT EYE RIGHT EYE UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF DOING THE SAME THING
I REACHED INTO THE OPENING AND THREE FEET AWAY PERHAPS I COULD TOUCH THE BRICKS OF THE PARTITION WALL
THE DETECTIVE THINKS POSSIBLY JACK BAILEY CAME BACK AND--AND THE THING HAPPENED THEN HE DIDN'T COME BACK HALSEY SAID STERNLY
MINUTE I SHET MY EYES OUT THAT LAMP'D GO
TO PROVE IT HOWEVER I DROPPED IT AGAIN
YOU'RE GOIN TO SMASH THE TRAP MR JAMIESON COAXED HIM OVER BY HOLDING OUT A LEAD-PENCIL STRIPED BLUE AND YELLOW
HE WAS HERE WASN'T HE MR JARVIS PERSISTED
MISS RACHEL YOU CAN GET A DOZEN DETECTIVES AND PUT ONE ON EVERY STAIR IN THE HOUSE AND YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ANYTHING
NO I SAID
PERHAPS YOU WOULD BETTER GO
THIS LAST QUESTION IT SEEMED TO ME WAS ANSWERED
AFTER THE FIRST SHOCK OF SURPRISE I FLATTER MYSELF I WAS BOTH COOL AND QUIET
THE MILK-BILL ALONE IS ALMOST DOUBLE WHAT IT WAS HOW MUCH IS THE CHILD'S BOARD I ASKED
THANK GOODNESS THERE ARE SOME MEN IN THE HOUSE TO-NIGHT I WAS GETTING INTO MY SLIPPERS AND A BATH-ROBE AND GERTRUDE WITH SHAKING HANDS WAS LIGHTING A LAMP
I HADN'T ANY COMPLAINT AGAINST YOU PEOPLE HERE AND THE DRAGON FLY WAS A GOOD CAR SO ROSIE'S HIGHWAYMAN WAS EXPLAINED
JAMIESON LIFTED HIS HAT WITHOUT SPEAKING
THERE WAS A LIGHT IN THE SITTING-ROOM DOWN-STAIRS AND A FAINT GLEAM AS IF FROM A SHADED LAMP IN ONE OF THE UPPER ROOMS
BUT OF LATE YEARS IT HAS GROWN TOO PAINFUL
THE REST LOST IN SPECULATION PROBABLY THE PAPERS SAID
ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING LIDDY AND MRS RALSTON MY OWN HOUSEKEEPER HAD A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AND MRS RALSTON LEFT ON THE ELEVEN TRAIN
WHAT IF ELIZA DID SEE SOME MEN AROUND THE STABLE
THEY'RE YOURS MISS RACHEL--AND COVERED WITH MUD AND SOAKED TO THE TOPS
THE FOUR DAYS FROM SATURDAY TO THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY WE LIVED OR EXISTED IN A STATE OF THE MOST DREADFUL SUSPENSE
WHEN SHE SAW HER MISTAKE SHE RAN UP THE STAIRS A STEP OR TWO AND TURNING LIKE AN ANIMAL AT BAY SHE FIRED HALSEY HAD HIS HAND OVER MY LIPS BEFORE I FINISHED AND IN THAT POSITION WE STARED EACH AT THE OTHER OUR STRICKEN GLANCES CROSSING
SOME THINGS WERE CLEAR TO HIM THAT WERE DARK TO ME
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO ALLOW HIM ENTREE THERE AT ANY TIME
A MONTH AGO--FIVE WEEKS TO BE EXACT--A WOMAN WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN CAME TO MY OFFICE
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THOMAS KNEW SOMETHING OR SUSPECTED SOMETHING THAT HE WOULD NOT TELL
THEY WERE DISPUTING VIOLENTLY AND I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNIZING MR ARMSTRONG
IF THAT IS FUNNY THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY SENSE OF HUMOR YOU MISS THE POINT HE SAID STILL GOOD-NATUREDLY
THINGS WERE LOOKING UP
THERE SHE FOUND LUCIEN'S FATHER THIS TIME UNDER HIS OWN NAME
COULDN'T YOU STOP HIM HALSEY
IF THE SERIES OF CATASTROPHES THERE DID NOTHING ELSE IT TAUGHT ME ONE THING--THAT SOMEHOW SOMEWHERE FROM PERHAPS A HALF-CIVILIZED ANCESTOR WHO WORE A SHEEPSKIN GARMENT AND TRAILED HIS FOOD OR HIS PREY I HAVE IN ME THE INSTINCT OF THE CHASE
IT WAS THREE WHEN THE SHOT WAS FIRED I LEANED BACK BEWILDERED
BUT AS WE PASSED DOCTOR WALKER'S WHITE AND GREEN HOUSE I THOUGHT OF SOMETHING
IF HALSEY WHY YOU DON'T THINK HALSEY DID IT I EXCLAIMED
YES
YES
INNES IT WAS HALSEY'S FLOWING SIGNATURE TO A DOT BUT IT LACKED HALSEY'S EASE
BUT I READ OVER THE HEAD-LINE THAT RAN HALF-WAY ACROSS THE TOP OF THE GAZETTE TWICE BEFORE I COMPREHENDED IT
YOU ARE SURE OF THAT MISS INNES CERTAIN IN WHAT PART IN THE EAST WING CAN YOU TELL ME WHEN THESE INTRUSIONS OCCURRED AND WHAT THE PURPOSE SEEMED TO BE
I HAD GIVEN IT TO HIM ON HIS TWENTY-FIRST BIRTHDAY
SHE DID IT AS GENTLY AS SHE COULD TELLING HER FIRST THAT HE WAS VERY ILL AND FINALLY THAT HE WAS DEAD
I HAVE COME OUT HERE ON A PECULIAR ERRAND WHICH I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT LATER
I WAS NOT REGALED WITH THE NEW COOK'S EXTRAVAGANCE AS TO EGGS AND SHE EVEN FORBORE TO MENTION THAT JAMIESON ON WHOSE ARRIVAL SHE HAD LOOKED WITH SILENT DISFAVOR
WOULD NOT PAUL ARMSTRONG HAVE TAKEN HIS BOOTY WITH HIM
HE LOVED MONEY FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND THERE ARE NO POCKETS IN SHROUDS I SAID CYNICALLY
PAUL ARMSTRONG LAY VERY ILL IN CALIFORNIA AND HIS ONLY SON HAD BEEN MURDERED TWO DAYS BEFORE
IN THE ABSENCE OF DOCTOR WALKER A NUMBER OF CASANOVA PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONSULTING ME
I NOTICED THAT HE LOOKED TIRED AND DUSTY AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS ORDINARILY IMPECCABLE IN HIS APPEARANCE IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE WAS AT LEAST TWO DAYS FROM A RAZOR
I AM GOING TO MARRY--ANOTHER MAN
YOU SAY YOUR NEPHEW AND MR BAILEY WERE IN THE HOUSE LAST NIGHT AND YET YOU AND YOUR NIECE WITH SOME WOMEN-SERVANTS FOUND THE BODY
I COULD HEAR THE PAPER BOY WHISTLING DOWN THE DRIVE AND I HEARD SOMETHING ELSE
AT THE DOOR HE WAS TO FORCE WARNER PUT DOWN HIS TOOLS AND LOOKED AT IT
WORSE THAN THAT MR JARVIS I SAID
I WAS EXASPERATED
ALL BANK FAILURES HAVE THIS ELEMENT HOWEVER AND THE DIRECTORS WERE TRYING TO PROMISE TWENTY PER CENT
HALSEY PICKED IT UP WITH AN EXCLAMATION
SHE WAS NOT THERE
POSSIBLY HE DID MEET HER OCCASIONALLY BUT FROM HIS CONTINUED GLOOM I FELT SURE THE SITUATION BETWEEN THEM WAS UNCHANGED
EVERYTHING WAS QUIET AND EMPTY
HE IS DEAD WE STOOD THERE EACH AVOIDING THE OTHER'S EYES
WELL GIVE A PLACE A REPUTATION LIKE THAT AND YOU DON'T NEED A GUARD AT ALL,--THUS JAMIESON
IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT SHE WAS MUCH IMPROVED
I WAS RELUCTANTLY ABOUT TO CONCEDE THAT HE HAD BEEN RIGHT WHEN MY EYES FELL ON THE MANTEL AND FIREPLACE
AS IT IS I SHOW THE WEAR AND TEAR OF MY HARROWING EXPERIENCES
I AIN'T SAYIN NOTHIN MIS INNES HE SAID WITH HIS HAND ON THE DOOR-KNOB BUT THERE'S BEEN GOIN'S-ON HERE THIS LAS FEW MONTHS AS AIN'T NATCHAL
THANK HEAVEN IT WOULDN'T CHIP--AND THEN SHE STARED AT ME
IN TWELVE HOURS HE'LL BE CALLING YOU AUNT
IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT DOCTOR WALKER MIGHT BE CONCERNED IN IT MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE BOTHERED HER WITH UNWELCOME ATTENTIONS
THE NEXT MORNING ALSO HALSEY AND I MADE AN EXHAUSTIVE EXAMINATION OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE THE SMALL ENTRY AT ITS FOOT AND THE CARD-ROOM OPENING FROM IT
IT SHOWS WHAT THE COUNTRY MIGHT BE UNDER FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
HE DOES NOT SHE SAID IN A TONE THAT WAS NOT HER OWN
HE HAD BEEN PAYING YOU UNWELCOME ATTENTIONS AND I HAD NEVER SEEN THE MAN
MARY ANNE WAS EMBARRASSED
NOT ILL HALSEY SAID FROM THE STEP
IT KNOCKED ME DUMB
I LEFT THE LIGHTS ALL ON AND OUR FOOTSTEPS ECHOED CAVERNOUSLY
I THINK IT STUNNED HIM FOR I HAD A SECOND'S RESPITE WHEN I COULD HEAR HIM BREATHING AND SOME ONE SHOUTED OUTSIDE
THE LAST PARAGRAPH WAS THE IMPORTANT ONE
A PRUNING-LADDER HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM WHERE IT HAD LAIN AGAINST THE STABLE AND NOW STOOD UPRIGHT IN THE CLOTHES SHAFT ITS END RESTING AGAINST THE WALL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOORS
IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF DAYS NOW GLOOMILY
DID ANY ONE COME OUT HERE YESTERDAY TO REPAIR THE TELEPHONE AND EXAMINE THE WIRES ON THE ROOF YES I SAID PROMPTLY
I GOT OUT OF BED AND EXAMINED THE OPPOSITE WALL CLOSELY
THOMAS HAD A KEY TO THE EAST ENTRY AND GAVE IT TO HER
GERTRUDE SPENT THE MORNING WITH ME READING SOMETHING--I FORGET WHAT
MOREOVER THIS DECISION WAS NOT NEW
ANY MOMENT WE MAY HEAR THE CAR COMING UP THE ROAD BUT IT DID NOT COME
IT IS CAUGHT HE SAID WITH A GRIM SMILE
THE PAPER HAD BEEN PASSED ALONG FROM A HOBO IN JOHNSVILLE WHO SEEMED TO KNOW THE INFORMATION WOULD BE VALUABLE TO US
I AM A COWARD--A COWARD I SAT BESIDE THE BED AND STARED AT HER
SOME GASOLENE EXPLODED JUST AS THE VOLUNTEER DEPARTMENT GOT TO WORK WHICH SHOOK THEIR NERVES AS WELL AS THE BURNING BUILDING
WHATEVER SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO DO I COULD FIND NOTHING BUT A DEEP SYMPATHY FOR HER
I THINK HE HOPED CONSTANTLY THAT HE MIGHT MEET LOUISE DRIVING OVER THE HILLS IN HER RUNABOUT
AND THEN THOMAS MOTIONED TO A PARTLY OPEN DOOR AND I WENT IN
WAIT A MOMENT LIDDY I SAID
SAM BOHANNON AND WARNER HELPED IN THE SEARCH AND NOT A CLOSET ESCAPED SCRUTINY
AND JUST AS I GOT BACK INTO BED I HEARD A SOUND FROM THE EAST WING APPARENTLY THAT MADE ME STOP FROZEN WITH ONE BEDROOM SLIPPER HALF OFF AND LISTEN
TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK I NEVER REALLY LIVED UNTIL THAT SUMMER
AT A QUARTER BEFORE THREE MY BROTHER AND MR BAILEY LEFT THE HOUSE BY THE MAIN ENTRANCE
BUT WHEN THE BONDS ARE OFFERED FOR SALE HALSEY WON'T THE THIEF BE DETECTED AT ONCE HALSEY TURNED WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE
CHAPTER XXI FOURTEEN ELM STREET IT WAS MONDAY EVENING WHEN WE FOUND THE BODY OF POOR OLD THOMAS
YOU WILL BE PROTECTED
GERTRUDE FOUND LIMPING SLOWLY UP THE DRIVE WHEN I HAD THOUGHT SHE WAS IN BED
ONE BY ONE THEY HAD DIED AND BEEN BURIED BESIDE THEIR PARENTS IN A LITTLE TOWN IN THE MIDDLE WEST
BUT THE RESULT WAS DISAPPOINTING
TO ME THERE WAS ONE GLARING FLAW IN HER STORY AND IT SEEMED TO STAND OUT FOR EVERY ONE TO SEE
XXVIII A TRAMP AND THE TOOTHACHE XXIX A SCRAP OF PAPER XXX WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN XXXI BETWEEN TWO FIREPLACES XXXII ANNE WATSON'S STORY XXXIII AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS XXXIV THE ODDS AND ENDS THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE CHAPTER I I TAKE A COUNTRY HOUSE THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW A MIDDLE-AGED SPINSTER LOST HER MIND DESERTED HER DOMESTIC GODS IN THE CITY TOOK A FURNISHED HOUSE FOR THE SUMMER OUT OF TOWN AND FOUND HERSELF INVOLVED IN ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS CRIMES THAT KEEP OUR NEWSPAPERS AND DETECTIVE AGENCIES HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS
I EXPECTED IT
THAT IS SHE SUSPECTS FOUL PLAY BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW OF WHAT NATURE
A PERSON CLEVER ENOUGH TO GET INTO SUNNYSIDE AND TEAR A HOLE IN THE WALL WHILE I WATCHED DOWN-STAIRS IS NOT TO BE FOUND BY GOING AROUND THE SHRUBBERY WITH A LANTERN WITH THE DEATH OF THOMAS I FELT THAT A CLIMAX HAD COME IN AFFAIRS AT SUNNYSIDE
THOMAS TOLD ME QUITE FRANKLY THAT HE HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO KEEP LOUISE'S PRESENCE HIDDEN FOR THIS REASON
MR JAMIESON LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
I HAVE SPOKEN OF HALSEY'S RESTLESSNESS
NOT BAD LOOKING GERTRUDE SAID PUTTING DOWN THE BOOK SHE HAD BEEN PRETENDING TO READ
HE HAD BEEN FAR FROM A MODEL HUSBAND EVEN FOR THE THREE MONTHS AND WHEN HE DISAPPEARED ANNE WAS ALMOST THANKFUL
SURELY YOU ARE MISTAKEN MR HARTON
BUT I HAZARDED A RANDOM SHOT
IT WAS WITH A COMFORTABLE FEELING OF SECURITY THAT I WENT TO BED THAT NIGHT
ON THE THIRD NIGHT I BELIEVED THAT SOME ONE HAD BEEN IN THE HOUSE
WE PUT LOUISE IN A STEAMER CHAIR AND SHE SAT THERE PASSIVELY ENOUGH HER HANDS CLASPED IN HER LAP
THANK GOD SHE SAID IN A SHAKING VOICE
THE HEAVY OAK CHAIR ALMOST FILLED THE SPACE BETWEEN THE NEWEL POST AND THE DOOR
IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS I WANT YOU TO READ IT AGAIN
DO YOU KNOW HOUR MUCH MONEY THERE WAS IN THAT WORN-OUT WALLET OF HIS
AND SEND ROSIE HERE HE DID NOT GO FAR
HIS SMOOTH UPPER LIP HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT DISGUISE WITH HIS CHANGE OF CLOTHES AND A HAIR-CUT BY A COUNTRY BARBER
DON'T GO DOWN THERE SHE YELLED WHEN SHE SAW ME MOVING TOWARD THE BASEMENT STAIRS
WHATEVER IT WAS I SAT WITHOUT MOVING AND SOME ONE OUTSIDE IN ABSOLUTE STILLNESS RAN HIS FINGERS OVER THE CARVING OF THE MANTEL AND--FOUND THE PANEL
I WAS PAST THAT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TERRIBLE THOUGHTS CAME TO ME IN THE MINUTE I STOOD THERE
IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO PUT YOUR HEAD IN AND THE PLASTER'S ALL OVER THE PLACE NONSENSE I SAID
IT FELL WITH A SINGLE MUFFLED CRASH OF ITS WOODEN FRAME AND INCIDENTALLY RUINED ITSELF BEYOND REPAIR
HER ENGAGEMENT ONCE SO ENGROSSING A MATTER PALED NOW BESIDE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HER STORY
THE OLD MAN SAID LOUISE WAS IN TROUBLE AND SEEMED FRIGHTENED
NO I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY ONE EXCEPT OLD THOMAS WHO LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD AS IF HE HAD BEEN RANSACKING THE PANTRY
I RAN DOWN THE STEPS AND ALONG THE DRIVE
DOCTOR I ASKED AT A VENTURE HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A CHILD NAMED LUCIEN WALLACE CLEVER AS HE WAS HIS FACE CHANGED AND STIFFENED
MR ARMSTRONG HAD NO KEY WITH HIM
JACK BAILEY WAS NOT THERE
I STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A MOMENT IN THE DARKNESS UNABLE TO COMPREHEND WHAT HAD HAPPENED
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED NOW
HOW SHE YELLED VOCIFEROUSLY AND JUMPED UP
JOHN BAILEY HAD BEEN RELEASED ON BOND
ON THE SUNDAY MORNING PREVIOUS AT A QUARTER BEFORE FIVE HE HAD BEEN CALLED TO THE TELEPHONE
I WAS TOO BUSY WITH MY THOUGHTS TO LISTEN
IS THERE ANY ONE YOU CAN THINK OF WHO COULD BE RELIED ON TO WATCH THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE TO-NIGHT WE MIGHT GET SAM BOHANNON FROM THE CLUB HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY
THEN I THOUGHT I'D BETTER GO UP TO THE HOUSE DIDN'T HE SAY ANYTHING ELSE YOU COULD UNDERSTAND I ASKED
HE WAS FISHING IN HIS POCKET AND AFTER A MINUTE HE BROUGHT OUT TWO SCRAPS OF PAPER
I DID
HALSEY WAS AIMLESSLY KNOCKING THE BILLIARD-BALLS AROUND IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM AND I CALLED TO HIM
I THINK HE WAS LABORING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
I HAD SAID NOTHING TO THE TWO DETECTIVES
I WENT IN WHEN I HEARD HER GROANING AND FOUND HER WITH A HOT-WATER BOTTLE TO HER FACE AND HER RIGHT CHEEK SWOLLEN UNTIL IT WAS GLASSY
ARNOLD ARMSTRONG AND JOHN BAILEY HAVE BEEN ENEMIES SINCE THE LATTER AS CASHIER OF THE TRADERS BANK BROUGHT ARNOLD ALMOST INTO THE CLUTCHES OF THE LAW
POOR AUNT RAY HE SAID GENTLY
THE NEXT DAY BY DEGREES I GOT THE WHOLE STORY
ALMOST TWO MONTHS WAGES--AND YET THOSE DARKIES SELDOM HAVE A PENNY
AN INQUISITIVE FACE PEERING IN AT A WINDOW
A FEW DAYS AFTER THE SERVICES HE CALLED TO SEE ME A KIND-FACED LITTLE MAN IN A VERY BAD FROCK-COAT AND LAUNDERED TIE
I COULD SCARCELY STEP
YOU CAN RUN ACROSS TO THE DRUG-STORE ON AN ERRAND AND DO IT QUIETLY
ALMOST BURIED IN THE SOFT GROUND WAS A REVOLVER
GERTRUDE HAD SLIPPED OUT DURING MY TALK WITH MRS WATSON AND I DRESSED AND WENT DOWN-STAIRS
MR HARTON THE LAWYER WAS A LITTLE THIN MAN AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE DID NOT RELISH HIS BUSINESS THAT DAY
MR WINTERS I FOUND THIS MAN TRYING TO SELL THAT WATCH ON FIFTH STREET
HE POINTED OUT THE HOUSE ON THE EMBANKMENT WHERE THE OLD LADY AND HER DAUGHTER HAD HEARD THE CRASH AND SEEN TWO FIGURES BESIDE THE CAR
WHAT NAME DID THAT WOMAN IN THE KITCHEN GIVE SHE DEMANDED VICIOUSLY RIPPING OUT THE OFFENDING SLEEVE
AND ANOTHER THING
THERE HAVE BEEN INTRUDERS IN THE HOUSE AND STRANGE NOISES
A BIG FELLOW HE WAS TALL AND DARK AS GERTRUDE HAD SAID SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND ERECT WITH PROMINENT FEATURES AND A SQUARE JAW
I RECEIVED LESS GRATIFICATION--AND LESS GRATITUDE--WHEN I PRESENTED THE NEW SILVER COMMUNION SET TO ST BARNABAS
I HAD RENTED THE HOUSE WITHOUT BED FURNISHINGS
BEFORE MR HARTON LEFT HE TOLD ME SOMETHING OF THE ARMSTRONG FAMILY
I EXPECT HIM--AT ANY TIME HE WAS HERE YESTERDAY EVENING I BELIEVE NO--YES DIDN'T HE HAVE A GUEST WITH HIM
THE REASON WHY GERTRUDE HAD NOT KEPT HER TRYST WAS EVIDENT
THEN I REALIZED THAT A MAN WAS LYING DOUBLED UP AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND THAT ALEX WAS STOOPING OVER HIM
THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS WENT OUT THEN FADING SLOWLY UNTIL THERE WAS ONLY A RED-HOT LOOP TO BE SEEN IN THE BULB AND THEN EVEN THAT DIED AWAY AND WE WERE EMBARKED ON THE DARKNESS OF ANOTHER NIGHT
THAT MY NIECE AND I HAD INVESTIGATED AND FOUND A BODY
NOTHING COULD PASS HIM IN EITHER DIRECTION AND THE DOOR IN THE MORNING REMAINED AS SECURELY FASTENED AS IT HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
HE SAID HE WAS GLAD ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE BUT HE SAID NOT TO BE TOO SANGUINE DO YOU KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE I ASKED
AND I GOT IT--THE ONE I HAD FOUND IN THE TULIP BED--AND GAVE IT TO HIM
YOU ARE NOT EVEN JUST SHE FLAMED
FIND OUT WHAT HE WANTS AND FROM THIS TIME ON INSTRUCT THE SERVANTS THAT HE IS NOT TO BE ADMITTED
RUMOR HAD IT THAT SUNNYSIDE WAS BURNING AND IT WAS AMAZING HOW MANY PEOPLE THREW SOMETHING OVER THEIR NIGHT-CLOTHES AND FLEW TO THE CONFLAGRATION
WHOEVER HAD FALLEN HAD BEEN ABLE TO LOCK THE LAUNDRY DOOR ON THE INSIDE
OF COURSE THERE WAS NO TIME THEN TO VOICE SUCH AN IDEA
I THOUGHT IT WAS PROBABLE BECAUSE WALKER SPENT A LOT OF TIME UP HERE LAST SUMMER WHEN THE FAMILY WAS HERE AND BESIDES RIGGS THAT'S WALKER'S MAN HAD A VERY PAT LITTLE STORY ABOUT THE DOCTOR'S BUILDING A HOUSE ON THIS PROPERTY JUST AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL
I DO NOT THINK HE HAS BEEN MURDERED I SHRANK FROM THE WORD
THE CAR IS GONE BUT WARNER"--HE IS THE CHAUFFEUR--"WARNER IS AT THE LODGE AND KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT WELL I SAID IF I EVER GET MY HANDS ON HALSEY INNES I SHALL NOT LET GO UNTIL I HAVE TOLD HIM A FEW THINGS
HOW YOU MUST HATE ME--HATE ME I COULD HEAR HALSEY CROSS THE ROOM TO THE WINDOW
I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE SHE HELD IT UP AND LOOKED AT IT
GERTRUDE IS A VERY PRETTY GIRL NO MATTER HOW HER HAT IS AND I WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN HALSEY PRESENTED A GOOD-LOOKING YOUNG MAN WHO BOWED AT ME AND LOOKED AT TRUDE--THAT IS THE RIDICULOUS NICKNAME GERTRUDE BROUGHT FROM SCHOOL
PEOPLE ARE APT TO BE SO UNPLEASANT ABOUT THEIR DOGS
THEN SUDDENLY I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT IT WAS
I WAS TO WATCH FOR HER TO SEE IF SHE WENT TO SUNNYSIDE AND WHEREVER SHE WAS NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF HER UNTIL HE GOT HOME
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU DRIVING AT SHE DREW A LONG BREATH
THE IDEA PUZZLING AS IT WAS SEEMED BORNE OUT BY THIS CIRCUMSTANCE
I RACHEL INNES HAVE LEARNED NOT TO MIND IF THE COOK SITS DOWN COMFORTABLY IN MY SITTING-ROOM WHEN SHE IS TAKING THE ORDERS FOR THE DAY AND I AM GRATEFUL IF THE SILVER IS NOT CLEANED WITH SCOURING SOAP
IT'S A LONG TIME SINCE YOU AND I WERE IN LOVE LIDDY AND--WE FORGET LIDDY SNIFFED
DOCTOR STEWART HAD BEEN SUMMONED ALSO IT TRANSPIRING THAT IN THAT EARLY SUNDAY MORNING WHEN GERTRUDE AND I HAD GONE TO OUR ROOMS HE HAD BEEN CALLED TO VIEW THE BODY
I GOT OUT THE CUFF-LINK AND WENT WITH IT TO THE PANTRY
IT IS NOT IN MY POSSESSION CHAPTER XXII A LADDER OUT OF PLACE AT DINNER MR JAMIESON SUGGESTED SENDING A MAN OUT IN HIS PLACE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS BUT HALSEY WAS CERTAIN THERE WOULD BE NOTHING MORE AND FELT THAT HE AND ALEX COULD MANAGE THE SITUATION
AN EXPLANATION OF HOW THE FUGITIVE HAD ESCAPED INJURY WAS FOUND IN A HEAPED-UP BASKET OF CLOTHES UNDER THE CHUTE
JUST AS SURELY AS I SIT HERE THERE IS SOMETHING IN THIS HOUSE THAT IS WANTED VERY ANXIOUSLY BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE
AT THIS POINT IN MY STORY HALSEY ALWAYS SAYS
SHE WAS SMALL AND FAIR-HAIRED JUST A LITTLE BIT GRAY AND VERY SAD
THE MYSTERY IT INSINUATED HAD NOT BEEN CLEARED BY THE ARREST OF THE CASHIER
HALSEY REQUIRED LESS PERSONAL SUPERVISION AND AS THEY BOTH GOT THEIR MOTHER'S FORTUNE THAT WINTER MY RESPONSIBILITY BECAME PURELY MORAL
OTHERWISE NOTHING HAD BEEN TOUCHED
AND TELL ME THIS
I SHOULD THINK AFTER--WHAT HAPPENED HERE ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO SHE WOULD NEVER WISH TO COME BACK NEVERTHELESS HE REPLIED SHE IS MOST ANXIOUS TO COME
I KNEW MY MOTHER WISHED TO RENT IT WITHOUT TELLING MY--STEPFATHER BUT THE NEWS MUST HAVE REACHED HER AFTER I LEFT
HAD APPARENTLY GONE HIS WAY UNHINDERED THROUGH THE HOUSE AND GONE OUT AGAIN AS HE HAD ENTERED
A LONDON BAG WITH MIRRORS AND COSMETIC JARS OF WHICH THOMAS COULD NOT EVEN HAVE GUESSED THE USE
THERE'S SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T HOLD WITH HAND CUFFS SHE WAS MUTTERING THICKLY
AGAIN THE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE CAME INTO REQUISITION
MISS ARMSTRONG IS VERY ILL AND UNABLE TO SEE ANY ONE SHE SAID
THE CORONER LED THE WAY AT ONCE TO THE LOCKED WING AND WITH THE AID OF ONE OF THE DETECTIVES EXAMINED THE ROOMS AND THE BODY
AS WE WENT IN MRS WATSON APPEARED AT THE CARD-ROOM DOOR
SHE STOOD STARING INTO THE DARKNESS BEHIND STILL HOLDING THE PLATE
I THINK LIDDY WAS STUNNED WITH FRIGHT OR SHE WOULD HAVE SCREAMED
AS THE CARD WENT AROUND I THINK BOTH THE DETECTIVE AND I WATCHED FOR ANY POSSIBLE EFFECT IT MIGHT HAVE BUT BEYOND PERPLEXITY THERE SEEMED TO BE NONE
IN THE ABSENCE OF THE DETECTIVE ALEX AND HALSEY ARRANGED TO CHANGE OFF HALSEY TO BE ON DUTY FROM TEN TO TWO AND ALEX FROM TWO UNTIL SIX
I WOULD NOT BRING HIM BACK IF I COULD
WHERE CAN I FIND HIM FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE LOUISE GERTRUDE BURST OUT TELL US WHAT IS WRONG
WE GOT THE LIGHTS ON FINALLY AND LOOKED ALL THROUGH THE THREE ROOMS THAT CONSTITUTED THIS WING OF THE BASEMENT
YOU LET ME ATTEND TO THIS FELLOW WHOEVER IT IS AUNT RAY AND GO TO LOUISE WILL YOU
AND THAT AIN'T ALL,--NO MA'M
I MADE A MENTAL NOTE TO HAVE THE HOUSE MEASURED DURING THE DAY TO DISCOVER ANY DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE OUTER AND INNER WALLS AND I TRIED TO RECALL AGAIN THE EXACT WORDING OF THE PAPER JAMIESON HAD FOUND
HE WAITED FOR SOMETHING
THEN HE READ IT SLOWLY JUDICIALLY
ONE LOOK WAS ALL I NEEDED
THE PERSON WHO ESCAPED FROM THE LAUNDRY WAS A WOMAN WITH A FOOT OF MODERATE SIZE AND WELL ARCHED
A CAPABLE MAN I HARDLY KNOW I SAID VAGUELY
THEN FOR FOUR STEPS NOTHING
AND AFTER HER PLUCKY FIGHT FOR HIM IT SEEMS HARD I LOOKED THROUGH THE DUSK TO WHERE GERTRUDE'S LIGHT DINNER DRESS GLEAMED AMONG THE TREES
I DID THE BEST I COULD HOWEVER
ONE--TWO--THREE THE DOOR INTO THE TRUNK-ROOM HAD BEEN LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE
WAS IT THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT
MR JAMIESON PROMISED TO COME OUT THAT NIGHT AND TO BRING ANOTHER MAN WITH HIM
WHEN THEY GOT OFF THE TRAIN I SEZ SEZ I THERE'S ANOTHER BUNCH FOR SUNNYSIDE COOK PARLOR MAID AND ALL YES'M--SIX SUMMERS AND A NEW LOT NEVER LESS THAN ONCE A MONTH
ANYHOW DOCTOR WHILE I DON'T CARE TO FORCE AN ISSUE I SHALL CERTAINLY REMAIN HERE FOR A TIME AT LEAST FOR HOW LONG HE ASKED
IF THE FUGITIVE HAD COME FROM OUTSIDE THE HOUSE HOW DID HE GET IN
HE SEEMED TO BE WALKING UP AND DOWN AND HE WAS IN A RAGE I CAN TELL YOU WHAT DID HE SAY THE FIRST THING I HEARD WAS--EXCUSE ME MISS INNES BUT IT'S WHAT HE SAID THE DAMNED RASCAL HE SAID I'LL SEE HIM IN'--WELL IN HELL WAS WHAT HE SAID IN HELL FIRST THEN SOMEBODY ELSE SPOKE UP
THEN I FELT THAT SOME ONE WAS COMING TOWARD ME ON THE STAIRCASE
NO MA'M
NO MA'M
THE LOWER ARNOLD SANK IN THE SCALE THE HEAVIER HIS DEMANDS BECAME
ANNE TOOK THE CHILD FROM THE HOME AND HID HIM IN A FARMHOUSE NEAR CASANOVA ON THE CLAYSBURG ROAD
THE BEST WAY IN MY OPINION WOULD BE TO----THE PLAN FOR----IN ONE OF THE----ROOMS----CHIMNEY THAT WAS ALL
THIS YOUNG DOCTOR WALKER--HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHY MR INNES SHOULD HAVE GONE THERE LAST NIGHT I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND IT GERTRUDE SAID THOUGHTFULLY
I HAD MY FIRST CONVERSATION WITH LOUISE
WE HAD A QUIET HOUR HALSEY AND I THAT EVENING AND I TOLD HIM SEVERAL THINGS
SHE'D BEEN STRUCK BY THE EXPRESS AND YOU WOULD HARDLY HAVE KNOWN HER--DEAD OF COURSE
I HAD ONE OF THE UNUSED BEDROOMS IN THE EAST WING BACK ALONG THE SMALL CORRIDOR PREPARED FOR OCCUPANCY AND FROM THAT TIME ON ALEX THE GARDENER SLEPT THERE
I HAVE BEEN PARTICULAR ABOUT ALEX BECAUSE AS I SAID BEFORE HE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART LATER
HOWEVER LIDDY GOT OUT THE BLACK THINGS AND THE CRAPE VEIL I KEEP FOR SUCH OCCASIONS AND I WENT
SHE SAID I WARNED THEM BUT THEY THOUGHT I WOULD BE AFRAID A WOMAN
THE KNOCKING HAD STOPPED AND I WAS AFRAID I WAS TOO LATE
THE TRAIN WAS GOING WEST AND DUE TO LEAVE AT DAWN
IN SPITE OF THE OTHER CHILDREN I THINK THE LITTLE FELLOW IS LONELY
I LAY IN MY BED LOOKING AROUND THE FOUR WALLS OF THE ROOM AND TRYING TO IMAGINE BEHIND WHAT ONE OF THEM A SECRET CHAMBER MIGHT LIE
JONAS THE WATCHMAN AT THE TRADERS BANK TELLS A DIFFERENT STORY
WHEN MR JAMIESON HAD FINISHED HIS CURSORY EXAMINATION HE GOT UP AND DUSTED THE KNEES OF HIS TROUSERS
I EXAMINED IT AGAIN WITH NO NEW RESULT
I COULD ONLY STAND AND STARE
I HAD THREE HOURS BEFORE THE CHILDREN COULD POSSIBLY ARRIVE AND I GOT OUT MY KNITTING
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT MISS INNES ALEX SAID
IT'S LOCKED ON THE INSIDE HE SAID IN A LOW TONE
HE STOPPED AT THE DOOR
SHE SEEMED TO BE IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF GOOSE-FLESH AND SHE HAD GOT IN THE HABIT OF LOOKING PAST ME WHEN SHE TALKED AS IF SHE SAW THINGS
HAD THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR BEEN THERE A THIRD TIME THE NIGHT ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS MURDERED
IT WAS ELUSIVE DIFFICULT TO ANALYZE BUT IT WAS THERE
SHE LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE MIGHT BE EQUAL TO A DOZEN OF LIDDY WITH HER SNAPPING BLACK EYES AND HEAVY JAW
AND WHERE DID YOU LIVE BEFORE YOU CAME HERE THE DETECTIVE WAS POLITE ENOUGH NOT TO SMILE
WILL YOU TELL US THE NATURE OF HIS ERRAND HE BROUGHT A TELEGRAM THAT HAD COME TO THE CLUB FOR MR BAILEY HE WAS SOBER PERFECTLY AT THAT TIME
PERHAPS TO-NIGHT SHE CAN BE TOLD IT IS VERY SAD
THE TELEGRAM RECEIVED ON THURSDAY HAD SENT THE CASHIER TO THE BANK THAT NIGHT IN A FRENZY
I WAS NOT SLEEPING WELL SHE BEGAN PARTLY I THINK BECAUSE I HAD SLEPT DURING THE AFTERNOON
WITH THE RUPTURE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS FAMILY THINGS WERE WORSE
EGG-NOG FOR MISS LOUISE HE WAS BEAMING WITH SATISFACTION AND BEFORE HE LEFT HE INSISTED ON GOING BACK TO THE PANTRY AND MAKING AN EGG-NOG WITH HIS OWN HANDS
MATTIE BLISS I REPLIED
WHAT DO YOU THINK FRIGHTENED HIM MR JAMIESON IT IS HARD TO SAY HE REPLIED SLOWLY BUT I THINK WE MAY BE CERTAIN IT WAS FRIGHT AND THAT HE WAS HIDING FROM SOMETHING
JONAS ADMITTED HIM AND HE SAYS THE CASHIER WAS IN A STATE ALMOST OF COLLAPSE
I WAS DUMB WITH APPREHENSION
BLISS
BLISS
THE STARS QUITE ECLIPSED IN THE CITY BY THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS HERE BECOME INSISTENT ASSERTIVE
WHETHER I WANT TO OR NOT I FIND MYSELF LOOKING FOR THE FEW I KNOW BY NAME AND FEELING RIDICULOUSLY NEW AND SMALL BY CONTRAST--ALWAYS AN UNPLEASANT SENSATION
WHEN THEY CAME WITHIN RANGE OF THE LIGHT I RECOGNIZED HALSEY AND WITH HIM MRS WATSON THE HOUSEKEEPER
YOU HAVE A TOOTH JUST LIKE IT YOURSELF MISS RACHEL SHE WHIMPERED
SAID HE COULDN'T FOOL HER
TAKEN ALL AROUND I HAD ONLY SUBSTITUTED ONE MYSTERY FOR ANOTHER
NEVER WAS A HOUSE MORE CHEERY AND OPEN LESS SINISTER IN GENERAL APPEARANCE
THE THING THAT HAS PUZZLED ME IS WHY MR ARMSTRONG SHOULD ENTER HIS FATHER'S HOUSE TWO NIGHTS IN SUCCESSION STEALING IN LIKE A THIEF WHEN HE NEEDED ONLY TO ASK ENTRANCE TO BE ADMITTED THE CORONER WAS A VERY SILENT MAN
THEN ROSIE BEGAN TO CRY--NOT SILENTLY BUT NOISILY HYSTERICALLY
HER SKIRTS WERE DRAGGLED WITH DEW TO HER KNEES AND HER HAIR WAS STILL IN CRIMPS
SHE THOUGHT AS I DID THAT THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT OF IT
THE STABLE'S ON FIRE I COULD SEE HIM IN THE GLARE DANCING UP AND DOWN ON THE DRIVE AND A MOMENT LATER HALSEY JOINED HIM
LOUISE AND HER MOTHER HAD FROM THE FIRST BEEN THE GREAT STUMBLING-BLOCKS
EVEN THIS HAD WE KNOWN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PARADISE TO THE TERRIBLE TRUTH
I TOOK A LONG BREATH CLOSED THE DOOR FROM THE TRUNK-ROOM INTO THE HALL--THANK HEAVEN I DID NOT LOCK IT--AND PULLING THE MANTEL-DOOR WIDE OPEN I STEPPED INTO THE CHIMNEY-ROOM
I HEARD THE THUD OF A STONE AND A SPIT FOLLOWED BY A LONG AND STARTLED MEIOU FROM BEULAH
HAVE YOU FOUND A CLUE THAT WILL INCRIMINATE ME MR JAMIESON HE HAD THE GRACE TO LOOK UNCOMFORTABLE
HALSEY HAD POINTED IT OUT WITH DELIGHT
HE GOT OUT OF THE OTHER SIDE AND JUST AS HE DID SO HE HEARD SOME ONE GROAN
HALSEY I PERSEVERED SOME ONE IS BREAKING INTO THE HOUSE
BUT I AM CONVINCED OF ONE THING
AND THEN--I KNEW I WAS RIGHT
IT WAS NOT A NEW IDEA BUT WHY HAD SHE DONE IT
THOMAS WOULD BE OF NO USE
SHE HAD GROPED AROUND FOUND THE ARTICLE SHE WAS LOOKING FOR AND WAS ON THE POINT OF RETURNING TO HER ROOM WHEN SHE HAD HEARD SOME ONE FUMBLING AT THE LOCK AT THE EAST OUTER DOOR
THE REVOLVER--I AM AFRAID OF THEM BUT ANXIETY GAVE ME COURAGE TO LOOK THROUGH THE BARREL--THE REVOLVER HAD STILL TWO BULLETS IN IT
HER STORY BROKEN WITH SOBS AND CORRECTIONS FROM THE OTHER TWO WAS THIS
OH MISS RACHEL IT'S THE GHOST OF THAT DEAD MAN HAMMERING TO GET IN SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A DULL THUD--THUD--THUD FROM SOME PLACE NEAR
AND BESIDES GERTRUDE'S SWORN STATEMENT THAT YOU LEFT BEFORE ARNOLD ARMSTRONG CAME WOULD CLEAR YOU AT ONCE HALSEY GOT UP AND BEGAN TO PACE THE ROOM AND THE AIR OF CHEERFULNESS DROPPED LIKE A MASK
IS THAT YOU THOMAS
IT WAS NOT VANDALISM
BUT THIS HOUSE IS NOT MINE AND I DON'T WANT A CONFLAGRATION
I THOUGHT TRUDE AND I THOUGHT WE WERE HELPING HIM BUT IT WAS THE WRONG WAY
THE TAPPINGS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE CEASED FOR A WHILE HAD COMMENCED AGAIN BUT THEY WERE FAINTER
YES YES
AND WHEN THAT TIME COMES YOU WILL ALL DESPISE ME,--HALSEY TOO I TRIED TO TELL HER HOW GLAD I WAS TO HAVE HAD HER BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE SHE WANTED TO SAY
AND THEN SUDDENLY FROM APPARENTLY UNDER MY VERY FEET THERE ROSE A WOMAN'S SCREAM A CRY OF TERROR THAT BROKE OFF AS SUDDENLY AS IT CAME
F
ALONG THE DRIVE I SHOWED HALSEY WHERE I HAD FOUND ROSIE'S BASKET WITH THE BITS OF BROKEN CHINA PILED INSIDE
THEY WERE ALMOST PATHETICALLY GRATEFUL HOWEVER I NOTICED FOR AN OCCASIONAL BROILED TENDERLOIN
SHE PAID HIM AND HE LEFT HER THERE
I MADE UP MY MIND AS THE CAR DREW UP BEFORE THE TATE COTTAGE THAT I WOULD SEE LOUISE IF I HAD TO BREAK INTO THE HOUSE AT NIGHT
ON SATURDAY EVENING BEFORE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK HE HAD BEEN READING IN THE SITTING-ROOM DOWN-STAIRS WHEN SOME ONE RAPPED AT THE DOOR
DO YOU KNOW I BELIEVE SHE IS GLAD GLAD
NO DOUBT THEY WERE EVEN THEN HEAPED NEATLY ON A GRAVESTONE IN THE CASANOVA CHURCHYARD
GOOD AFTERNOON I SAID
WHOEVER KILLED MR ARMSTRONG WOULD PUT AS MUCH SPACE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THIS HOUSE AS HE COULD
I WILL SEND FOR YOU AS SOON AS SHE CAN SEE YOU I SAID
YOU SEE MISS INNES HE SAID MR BAILEY INSISTS ON MIXING HIMSELF WITH THIS THING
HE DIDN'T COME BACK THAT NIGHT SHE SAID AND IT WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT I SHOULD SEE HIM I BELIEVE HE HAS GONE AWAY I REPLIED UNCERTAINLY
PAUL ARMSTRONG EVIDENTLY STUDIED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
SAD AND TRAGIC THOUGH IT WAS THE VERY TELLING OF IT SEEMED TO RELIEVE THE DYING WOMAN
LOCK UP THE HOUSE AND GO TO BED
IT SEEMED THAT HALSEY HAD STOPPED AT THE GREENWOOD CLUB FOR GASOLENE AND FOUND JACK BAILEY THERE WITH THE SUNDAY GOLF CROWD
AND MRS ARMSTRONG--IS SHE ALSO ILL SHE IS WITH MISS LOUISE AND CAN NOT BE DISTURBED TELL HER IT IS MISS INNES AND THAT IT IS A MATTER OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE IT WOULD BE OF NO USE MISS INNES
WAKE UP HALSEY I SAID SHAKING HIM
UNDER PRETEXT OF LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE PLACE THOMAS JOHNSON LED ME THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THE CELLARS WITHOUT RESULT
THE BASKET STILL STOOD ON THE TABLE A MUTE WITNESS TO THIS LAST MYSTIFYING OCCURRENCE
THEN FURIOUS AT HER APPARENT CONNIVANCE HE HAD STARTED FOR THE STATION
I WAITED UNTIL SHE HAD HAD TIME TO GET ALMOST TO THE HOUSE BEFORE I STARTED
YOU WERE COMING UP THE DRIVE I HAD A BASKET OF--OF SILVER AND DISHES ON MY ARM AND I WAS CARRYING THE PLATE BECAUSE--BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID I'D BREAK IT
MRS WATSON HAD GONE TO THE HOUSE FOR SOME BED-LINEN IT HAVING BEEN ARRANGED THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES LOUISE WOULD BE BETTER AT THE LODGE UNTIL MORNING
SHE WAITED AROUND WALKING THE FLOOR AND WORKING HERSELF INTO A PASSION
HALSEY SUDDENLY GERTRUDE'S STRICKEN FACE ROSE BEFORE ME THE EMPTY ROOMS UP-STAIRS
THEN I MUST HAVE FAINTED THAT WAS LOUISE'S STORY
I'VE BROUGHT YOU A COOK MISS INNES HE SAID
MR JAMIESON HAD TAKEN A LODGING IN THE VILLAGE AND I HAD NOT SEEN HIM SINCE MID-AFTERNOON
PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP-STAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
I SHALL NOT KEEP YOU FROM YOUR PATIENT
WE HAD PAUSED AT THE EDGE OF A LEVEL CLEARED PLACE BORDERED ALL AROUND WITH PRIMLY TRIMMED EVERGREEN TREES
SHE SEEMED PUZZLED
IT WAS THOMAS--THOMAS WITHOUT A MARK OF INJURY ON HIM AND DEAD
SO JAMIESON WAS PUTTING THE SCREWS ON--LIGHTLY NOW BUT READY TO GIVE THEM A TWIST OR TWO I FELT CERTAIN VERY SOON
THE GHOST WAS NOT LAID
I HARDLY KNEW WHAT I FEARED BUT SO MANY TERRIBLE AND INEXPLICABLE THINGS HAD HAPPENED THAT SUSPENSE WAS WORSE THAN CERTAINTY
SHE SAID I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG FROM THE START
SHE SAID I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG FROM THE START
AH WELL THE FOSTER MOTHERHOOD WOULD SOON HAVE TO BE PUT AWAY IN CAMPHOR AGAIN
LOUISE IS NOT HERE MRS FITZHUGH WENT ON AND NONE OF HER FRIENDS--THE FEW WHO ARE STILL IN TOWN--HAS SEEN HER
I WAS HELPLESS STRANGLING,--AND SOME ONE WAS TRYING TO BREAK IN THE MANTEL FROM OUTSIDE
I CALLED YOU BECAUSE SUNNYSIDE WAS NOT RENTED WHEN SHE WENT AWAY AND LOUISE MIGHT HAVE GONE THERE I AM SORRY MRS FITZHUGH BUT I CAN NOT HELP YOU I SAID AND WAS IMMEDIATELY FILLED WITH COMPUNCTION
WHEN WE TOOK THE HOUSE HE CALLED THAT HIS ENTRANCE AND HE HAD CARRIED A KEY FOR IT EVER SINCE
I SAW NOW BOTH THE MAN WHO HAD JOINED THE PARTY AND THE IMPLEMENTS HE CARRIED
WE--WE ALL TALKED TOGETHER FOR PERHAPS TEN MINUTES
OVER AND OVER I REPEATED IT TO MYSELF
LIDDY REPORTED THAT EVERYTHING WAS SERENE AMONG THE SERVANTS AND THAT NONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY THE NOISE
AN EXAMINATION OF THE BOOKS SHOWED NO IRREGULARITIES IN THE PAST YEAR SINCE JOHN HAD BEEN CASHIER BUT BEFORE THAT IN THE TIME OF ANDERSON THE OLD CASHIER WHO HAD DIED MUCH STRANGE JUGGLING HAD BEEN DONE WITH THE RECORDS
BRING A CANDLE AND A COUPLE OF BLANKETS SHE LAGGED BEHIND CONSIDERABLY WHEN SHE SAW ME MAKING FOR THE EAST WING AND AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE SHE BALKED
IN ANSWER TO THE CORONER'S QUESTION--NO THE BODY HAD NOT BEEN MOVED SAVE TO TURN IT OVER
WHEN SHE TURNED AROUND SHE FACED GERTRUDE WHO STOOD INDIGNANT ALMOST TRAGIC IN THE HALL
AND I BELIEVE THAT WHEN HE DID COME HE WAS ADMITTED BY SOME ONE IN THE HOUSE
HE HAD A HABIT OF WATCHING THE CORNERS OF THE ROOM LEFT SHADOWY BY THE CANDLES ON THE TABLE AND ALTOGETHER IT WAS NOT A FESTIVE MEAL
THE MANTEL FASCINATED ME
SHE WAS FULLY DRESSED AND I SAT UP NERVOUSLY
MR BAILEY CAME DOWN ACROSS THE LAWN THROUGH THE HEDGE AND GOT INTO THE CAR ON THE ROAD THEN YOU KNOW NOTHING OF MR ARMSTRONG'S MOVEMENTS AFTER HE LEFT THE HOUSE NOTHING
I PICKED UP A PEBBLE FROM THE ROOF AND DROPPED IT DOWN LISTENING WITH MY EAR AT ONE OF THE PIPES
THAT OLD THOMAS HAD SEEN HIS MASTER AND THOUGHT HE HAD SEEN THE SUNNYSIDE GHOST THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
I COULD HAVE CRIED WITH RELIEF
THERE'S STRANGE GOIN'S-ON HERE MIS INNES HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD
HE SAID THE WIRING MIGHT HAVE CAUSED THE FIRE AT THE STABLE
NINA CARRINGTON CARRINGTON HE WRINKLED HIS FOREHEAD
WHAT HALSEY SAID TO MRS ARMSTRONG I NEVER KNEW BUT THAT HE WAS CONSIDERATE AND CHIVALROUS I FEEL CONFIDENT
THE BREACH HAD BEEN MADE ABOUT FOUR FEET FROM THE FLOOR AND INSIDE WERE ALL THE MISSING BITS OF PLASTER
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT YOUR NEPHEW HE HAS DISAPPEARED DOCTOR
NO HE BELIEVED THE PROBABILITY OF SUICIDE MIGHT BE ELIMINATED
WHAT WAS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CUFF-LINK AND WHERE WAS IT
WHEN HALSEY LEARNED THE TRUTH HE INSISTED ON GOING THE NEXT MORNING WEAK AS HE WAS TO LOUISE AND BY NIGHT SHE WAS AT SUNNYSIDE UNDER GERTRUDE'S PARTICULAR CARE WHILE HER MOTHER HAD GONE TO BARBARA FITZHUGH'S
IT'S NOT A GHOST I SAID DECIDEDLY
LIDDY BROUGHT ME SOME HOT MILK AT TEN O'CLOCK AND I SLEPT UNTIL TWELVE
HE HELD HIS HAND OVER MY MOUTH AND I BIT HIM
IT WOULD BE OVER IN A MOMENT SO WOULD HANGING LIDDY PROTESTED FROM BEHIND THE HOT-WATER BOTTLE
CHAPTER XV LIDDY GIVES THE ALARM THE NEXT DAY FRIDAY GERTRUDE BROKE THE NEWS OF HER STEPFATHER'S DEATH TO LOUISE
I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO NOTIFY THE ARMSTRONGS I SAID
I SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK SEVERAL YEARS--THIRTEEN TO BE EXACT--TO START MY STORY
IT MUST HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE IN KEEPING WITH LOUISE'S CHARACTER AS I KNEW IT TO RESENT VIGOROUSLY ANY UNWELCOME ATTENTIONS FROM DOCTOR WALKER
ELIZA WAS IN A FRENZY OF FEAR
I COULD FANCY LIDDY'S FACE WHEN SHE MISSED THE EXTRA PIECES OF CHINA--SHE HAD OPPOSED ROSIE FROM THE START
HE HAD NOT USED THE MAIN STAIRCASE THERE WAS NO WAY TO THE UPPER FLOOR IN THE EAST WING AND LIDDY HAD BEEN AT THE WINDOW IN THE WEST WING WHERE THE SERVANTS STAIR WENT UP
IS THIS ONE OF THE SERVANTS BLANKETS MRS WATSON I ASKED HOLDING UP ITS LUXURIOUS FOLDS TO THE LIGHT
HOW DO WE KNOW THEY WEREN'T TRAMPING THROUGH THE CASANOVA CHURCHYARD LAST NIGHT AND SITTING ON THE GRAVES MR JAMIESON ALMOST CHOKED TO DEATH
THE WINDOW OR THE DOOR
ABOUT MY VISIT TO DOCTOR WALKER AND MY SUSPICIONS THAT MATTIE BLISS AND NINA CARRINGTON WERE THE SAME
THAT IS ALL
SHE GAVE HER NAME AS MRS WALLACE AND SAID SHE HAD NO ADDRESS
I CAN'T BEAR IT
PERHAPS A HUNDRED FEET FROM THE HOUSE WERE TWO FIGURES THAT MOVED SLOWLY TOWARD US AS WE LOOKED
TO PAY THE WOMAN TO KEEP QUIET WOULD BE CONFESSION
THE RICH OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE SAID WISTFULLY
IN FACT I MYSELF TOLD HIM ABOUT IT AND HE KNEW WHO THE TENANTS WERE YES HE HAD NOT BEEN LIVING WITH THE FAMILY FOR SOME YEARS I BELIEVE NO
I FOUND IT IN THE ROAD HONEST TO GOD I DID MR WINTERS PAID NO ATTENTION TO HIM
GERTRUDE'S DOOR WAS OPEN AND HALSEY'S REVOLVER LAY THERE ON THE BED
CHAPTER XIII LOUISE THE DOCTOR FROM ENGLEWOOD CAME VERY SOON AND I WENT UP TO SEE THE SICK GIRL WITH HIM
THE NOISE HAD CEASED AND EVERYTHING WAS QUIET
BUT LONG AFTER I WENT TO BED HE SAT DOWN-STAIRS IN THE LIVING-ROOM ALONE AND I KNEW HE WAS GOING OVER THE CASE AS HE HAD LEARNED IT
I'M SURE IT NEVER DID HER ANY PERMANENT HARM
I SAT UP AND LISTENED TO BE QUITE SURE AND THE RAPPING KEPT UP
WELL THAT WAS ALL FAR'S I KNOW UNTIL THE NIGHT I COME OVER TO SEE MIS INNES
I HAD BEEN GROWING MORE AND MORE NERVOUS
SOME ONE SCREAMED DOWN THERE I SAID
HE STEPPED OVER TO ALEX AND TOUCHED HIM ON THE ARM
THEN YOU SEE YOUR STORY ABOUT THE WOMAN AT THE CARD-ROOM WINDOW BEGINS TO MEAN SOMETHING
IF THOMAS IS ILL HALSEY SAID SOME MEMBER OF THE FAMILY OUGHT TO GO DOWN TO SEE HIM
YOU ARE MRS TATE I WONDERED HOW THE DETECTIVE KNEW
THEN HE LOOSENED THE GAG--IT HAD BEEN CRUELLY TIGHT--AND WENT HIS WAY AGAIN CLOSING THE DOOR OF THE BOX-CAR
THE TRUNK-ROOM ALTHOUGH HEATED BY STEAM HEAT LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSE BOASTED OF A FIREPLACE AND MANTEL AS WELL
HE TOOK OF HIS GLASSES AND WIPED THEM
PAUL DIED YESTERDAY
WILL YOU GIVE ME THE LINK HE SAID WHEN I FINISHED OR AT LEAST LET ME SEE IT
ALEX THE GARDENER HAD GONE HEAVILY UP THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM AND MR JAMIESON WAS EXAMINING THE LOCKS OF THE WINDOWS
MR JAMIESON LEFT THEN AND WHEN GERTRUDE HAD GONE UP-STAIRS AS SHE DID AT ONCE I SAT AND THOUGHT OVER WHAT I HAD JUST HEARD
WHEN I OPENED THEM THEIR BRIEF EXAMINATION WAS OVER AND MR JARVIS WAS TRYING TO PUT ME IN A CHAIR
LOUISE WAS SITTING IN A DEEP CHAIR LOOKING THE HAPPIEST I HAD EVER SEEN HER WITH HALSEY ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR HOLDING HER CLOSE
AND YOU ARE STILL GOING TO STAY UNTIL I AM BURNED OUT I RESPONDED
SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
SHE CLUTCHED AT THE FOOT OF THE BED AND STOOD STARING
HALSEY WAS YOUNG AND ILLNESS WAS NEW TO HIM
THEN I--MUST HAVE TAKEN A COLD ON THE TRAIN YOU CAME EAST IN CLOTHING SUITABLE FOR CALIFORNIA I SAID AND LIKE ALL YOUNG GIRLS NOWADAYS I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU WEAR FLANNELS BUT SHE WAS NOT LISTENING
HE HAS BEEN GONE SINCE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON
THE TOP WAS COVERED WITH FINE WHITE PLASTER AS WAS THE FLOOR
OF THE CONSPIRACY SHE SAID NOTHING
FROM THE WALLS TO THE RUGS ON THE FLOOR FROM THE FURNITURE TO THE APPOINTMENTS OF THE BATH WITH ITS POOL SUNK IN THE FLOOR INSTEAD OF THE CUSTOMARY UNLOVELY TUB EVERYTHING WAS LUXURIOUS
THERE IN A GRAY-WALLED ROOM IN A HIGH IRON BED LAY MRS WATSON
AND YET FOR ALL ITS QUIET IT WAS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT THAT PERHAPS THE BOLDEST ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO ENTER THE HOUSE
AND YET--I CLIMBED OUT ON TO THE SUNNYSIDE ROOF WITHOUT A SECOND'S HESITATION
I TRACED HER TO THE LODGE AND I GUESS I SCARED YOU ON THE DRIVE ONE NIGHT MISS INNES AND ROSIE I EJACULATED
IT WAS THE COMBINATION OF BAD AIR AND HEAT PROBABLY FOR SOME INADEQUATE VENTILATION WAS COMING THROUGH THE PIPES
BUT THE CHAIR HELD ALTHOUGH I COULD HEAR AN OMINOUS CRACKING OF ONE OF THE LEGS
THE DOOR TO THE BASEMENT STAIRS WAS DOUBLE-BARRED AND HAD A TABLE PUSHED AGAINST IT
THEY HAD ALL SEEN ARNOLD ARMSTRONG THAT NIGHT AND HE HIMSELF FOR ONE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE HAD NO VERY FRIENDLY FEELING FOR THE DEAD MAN
I DO NOT BELIEVE IT
WHEN I STEPPED OUT INTO THE TRUNK-ROOM A FREE WOMAN AGAIN I COULD HEAR THE CHASE FAR BELOW
I SHOULD THINK NOTHING WOULD KEEP YOU YOU ARE MISTAKEN
TUESDAY EVENING FOUND US QUIET WITH THE QUIET THAT PRECEDES AN EXPLOSION
GERTRUDE AND HALSEY WERE INFATUATED
I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX-CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
THESE ARRANGEMENTS WERE CAREFULLY KEPT FROM THE SERVANTS WHO WERE ONLY COMMENCING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT AND WHO RETIRED ONE AND ALL WITH BARRED DOORS AND LAMPS THAT BURNED FULL UNTIL MORNING
CERTAINLY I HAD LEFT THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW WAY
AND THEN TOO GO ON I SAID
I HAD INDEED ONE OF THE--BUT NO MATTER
MR JOHN BAILEY IS NOT AT HIS KNICKERBOCKER APARTMENTS AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS
I CAN THINK OF NO OTHER WAY
HE ASKED TWICE DURING THE MEAL ON WHAT TRAIN MR JAMIESON AND THE OTHER DETECTIVE WERE COMING AND HAD LONG PERIODS OF ABSTRACTION DURING WHICH HE DUG HIS FORK INTO MY DAMASK CLOTH AND DID NOT HEAR WHEN HE WAS SPOKEN TO
I WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK
TIME HAS PASSED SINCE I BEGAN THIS STORY
HE AND LOUISE HAD NO CONVERSATION TOGETHER UNTIL THAT NIGHT
FIND HIM AND FIND HIM SOON
AS IT TURNED OUT I DID SURPRISE THEM ALMOST INTO SPASMS
THAT WAS HOW WE WENT TO SUNNYSIDE
THE COOK WAS AT THE TELEPHONE UP-STAIRS CALLING THE GREENWOOD CLUB AND LIDDY WAS BEHIND ME AFRAID TO COME AND NOT DARING TO STAY BEHIND
THERE ARE FEW YOUNG FELLOWS LIKE HALSEY--STRAIGHTFORWARD HONEST AND WILLING TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING FOR THE ONE WOMAN
THE OCCURRENCE WAS SO UNUSUAL THAT THE WATCHMAN PONDERED OVER IT AN THE REST OF THE NIGHT
HE COULD HAVE COME WITH MY PERMISSION EASILY ENOUGH
I BELIEVE THAT IT IS A WOMAN'S DUTY TO CARE FOR HER LOOKS BUT IT IS MUCH LIKE TELLING A NECESSARY FALSEHOOD--ONE MUST NOT BE FOUND OUT
WHEN MR JAMIESON HUNG UP THE RECEIVER HE TURNED TO ME
WHEN I FINISHED LIDDY WAS BEHIND ME HER MOUTH A THIN LINE
WHAT THE HELL HE EJACULATED FURIOUSLY AND TURNED AROUND
I HAD MY GREATEST DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN IT CAME TO TRACING NINA CARRINGTON
TWO THINGS I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND YOU CONDEMN HIM I KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALL LOST A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY I SAID
NO ONE HAD ADMITTED THE VISITOR WHOM WARNER HAD HEARD IN THE LIBRARY UNLESS POSSIBLY THE MISSING COOK
SUNNYSIDE WITH ITS HOARD IN THE CHIMNEY-ROOM HAD BEEN RENTED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE
THE DEMANDS OF THE OCCASION HAD NO INFLUENCE ON HER
YOU NEVER LOOKED BETTER
BUT IT WAS NOT THE CHUG OF THE MOTOR
AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE SMALL HALLWAY WITH THE LARGER THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE WOUND ITS WAY UP AS IF IT HAD BEEN AN AFTERTHOUGHT OF THE ARCHITECT
WHERE AM I IN THIS HALSEY SAID SUDDENLY AND TRIED TO PUT HIS ARMS AROUND US BOTH
IN ANSWER SHE POINTED TO THE NEW COOK'S TRUNK--THAT NECESSARY ADJUNCT OF THE MIGRATORY DOMESTIC
WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE CONVERSATION YOU HELD WITH HIM THE NIGHT HE WAS ATTACKED AND CARRIED OFF ATTACKED
IT WAS FOR ALL THE WORLD AS IF SOMETHING HEAVY PERHAPS A PIECE OF STEEL HAD ROLLED CLATTERING AND JANGLING DOWN THE HARD-WOOD STAIRS LEADING TO THE CARD-ROOM
AREN'T THERE TRACES IN THE MUD--ANYTHING THERE IS NO MUD--ONLY DUST
VERY SAD HE SAID
GERTRUDE RAN FORWARD WITH A GASPING SOB
I AM INCLINED TO PLACE MORE FAITH IN DOCTOR STEWART'S STORY HE SAID SINCE I FOUND THAT SCRAP IN OLD THOMAS POCKET
SHE OUGHT TO A HAD A DOCTOR THE NIGHT SHE CAME BUT SHE WOULDN HEAR TO IT
I THOUGHT PERHAPS I SAID WATCHING HIM NARROWLY THAT IT MIGHT BE ABOUT--NINA CARRINGTON FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO STRIKE ME
I LAUGHED AND CRIED TOGETHER AND PRETTY SOON LIKE THE TWO OLD FOOLS WE WERE WE WERE SITTING TOGETHER WEEPING INTO THE SAME HANDKERCHIEF
AUNT RAY SHE CRIED HYSTERICALLY
PROBABLY A KEY TO THE EAST ENTRY THERE WAS NO REASON WHY THOMAS AN OLD AND TRUSTED SERVANT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD A KEY TO THAT PARTICULAR DOOR ALTHOUGH THE SERVANTS ENTRY WAS IN THE WEST WING
THEY SUPPLIED AIR BUT NOTHING ELSE
YOUR JACK'S FLIGHT IS EASY ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN NOW
HE AND PAUL ARMSTRONG TOGETHER HAD PROMOTED A RAILROAD COMPANY IN NEW MEXICO AND IT WAS RUMORED THAT TOGETHER THEY HAD SUNK LARGE SUMS OF MONEY THERE
WHO HAD BEEN LOCKED IN THE CLOTHES CHUTE
THERE WAS NOTHING FRIENDLY IN THE GLANCE HE TURNED ON ME
IT WAS THE MOST UNGHOSTLY THING IN THE WORLD WITH ITS LAVENDER BORDER AND ITS FAINT SCENT
SHE SAID IT WAS THE HAND SHE HAD HURT THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER A WEEK BEFORE AND THAT SHE HAD NOT SLEPT WELL SINCE
WE ARE VERY QUIET JUST THE TWO OF US
FOR THE LOVE OF MERCY LET ME IN SHE SAID IN A LOW TONE
MR BAILEY HAD NOT BEEN HARD TO PERSUADE--PROBABLY GERTRUDE KNEW WHY--AND THEY HAD CARRIED HIM OFF TRIUMPHANTLY
I RAN AS FAST AS I COULD AND HE CAME AFTER AS FAR AS THE TREES
IS THAT THE HORSE'S NAME IT IS SHE FLICKED THE HORSE'S STUBBY MANE WITH THE WHIP
SO STOP QUARRELING AND BE GOOD
PART-WAY OVER HE MET ARMSTRONG HIMSELF AND BROUGHT HIM TO THE LODGE
I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THE HOUSE BEFORE
OR A FOURTH THE TIME MR JAMIESON HAD LOCKED SOME ONE IN THE CLOTHES CHUTE
FOR INSTANCE
I--I AM NOT NERVOUS AND AFTER I HAD EXTINGUISHED THE LIGHT I REMEMBERED SOMETHING I HAD LEFT IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM AND I FELT MY WAY BACK THERE THROUGH THE DARKNESS WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT IT WAS YOU HAD FORGOTTEN I CAN NOT TELL YOU SHE SAID SLOWLY
I GOT DOWN THE STAIRCASE SOMEHOW AND THROUGH THE KITCHEN TO THE BASEMENT STAIRS
SO FANNY ARMSTRONG KNEW OF LUCIEN WALLACE AND WAS SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED TO VISIT HIM AND PAY FOR HIS SUPPORT
HE HAS BROUGHT A PATIENT A MAN OUT FROM TOWN AND IS INCREASING HIS ESTABLISHMENT--THAT'S THE WAY HE PUT IT I WISH HIM JOY OF ELIZA I SAID TARTLY
UNLIKE THE SUMMER PEOPLE HE GAVE NEITHER TO THE POOR NOR TO THE CHURCH
PAUL ARMSTRONG IS DEAD HE ANNOUNCED GRAVELY
AND THEN I CLUTCHED HER BY THE ARM AND POINTED TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS OPENING ON THE PORCH
I COULD FEEL IT BUT I COULD SEE NOTHING
MAY RIGGS COME UP
I WAS STILL ASKING MYSELF THE QUESTION WHEN WARNER CAME RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRS AND INTO THE ROOM
GERTRUDE STOOD SMILING IN THE HALL WITH HER HAT QUITE OVER ONE EAR AND HER HAIR IN EVERY DIRECTION UNDER HER PINK VEIL
NO MR INNES WAS NOT THERE BUT WE SHALL PROBABLY FIND HIM
BUT MY MIND WAS NOT ON MY WORK
ONE IS CURIOUS
SHE HAD PUT DOWN A SMALL VALISE AND STOOD INSPECTING THE HOUSE AND GROUNDS MINUTELY
IT SET ME TO THINKING
WHEN SHE NODDED A YES I SAW THE TREMENDOUS POSSIBILITIES INVOLVED
WHY NEITHER HALSEY NOR GERTRUDE HAS TOLD ME THAT THERE ARE MORE THINGS THAN THAT MISS INNES THAT ARE PUZZLING
HOW HAD HE GONE AND WHEN
I COULD HEAR A FAINT SCREAM FROM LIDDY AT THE CRASH AND THEN SHE CAME DOWN THE STAIRS ON A RUN WITH THE REVOLVER HELD STRAIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF HER
NOW NOT A WORD OF THIS THROUGH THE HOUSE AND SEND ALEX TO ME THE EFFECT ON ALEX WAS TO MAKE HIM APOPLECTIC WITH RAGE AND WITH IT ALL I FANCIED THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF SATISFACTION
WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN THOMAS JOHNSON BY NOT TELLING ME THIS BEFORE I DEMANDED INDIGNANTLY
SHE WAS BLUE-WHITE AROUND THE LIPS AND SHE HAD ONE HAND TIED UP
NOWADAYS IT REQUIRES A DIFFERENT SPECIALIST FOR EACH OF THESE OCCURRENCES
I KNOW EXACTLY THE CLOCK IN THE HALL IS STOPPED MISS INNES SAID JAMIESON
IT WAS COVERED WITH SCROLLS AND PANELS AND FINALLY BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT I PUSHED ONE OF THE PANELS TO THE SIDE
THE WHOLE THING IS AN ABSURDITY A TRUMPED-UP CHARGE THAT CAN NOT POSSIBLY BE SERIOUS HAS MR BAILEY GONE BACK TO THE CITY I DEMANDED OR TO THE CLUB NEITHER DEFIANTLY
IT IS A MOST UNFORTUNATE FAMILY HE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDENTLY AND I FELT THAT THIS DRIED-UP LITTLE MAN WAS THE REPOSITORY OF MUCH THAT HE HAD NOT TOLD ME
HER MOTHER COOKED FOR MY GRANDFATHER AND LIDDY MUST BE AT LEAST AS OLD AS I
I HAD PUT UP THE CAR AND FEELING SLEEPY I CAME DOWN TO THE LODGE TO GO TO BED
I SAT UP AND ALMOST UPSET MY HOT WATER--I ALWAYS TAKE A CUP OF HOT WATER WITH A PINCH OF SALT BEFORE I GET UP
NOW HOWEVER HE WENT QUICKLY TOWARD THE DOOR
MR JAMIESON HAD SAID THE WOMAN WHO ESCAPED FROM THE CELLAR HAD WORN NO SHOE ON HER RIGHT FOOT
IT IS AN OUTRAGEOUS FIGURE SOME ONE WAS STORMING
THE CUFF-LINK HAD BEEN DROPPED INTO A LITTLE FILIGREE BOX ON MY TOILET TABLE
ON THE EMBANKMENT ABOVE THE RAILROAD AT THE POINT WHERE WE FOUND THE MACHINE IS A SMALL HOUSE
YOU MIGHT HAVE TELEPHONED IF YOU WERE BUSY HE SMILED
YOU CERTAINLY CLEAR YOUR BROTHER AND MR BAILEY ADMIRABLY HE SAID
I STOOD FROZEN AND STILL
AS WE WENT BACK MR JAMIESON MADE ONLY ONE REMARK
SHE LOOKED YOUNG ALMOST PRETTY
NOT UNTIL THE MILK-BOY AND THE SUN CAME ABOUT THE SAME TIME DID I DARE TO OPEN THE DOOR INTO THE HALL AND LOOK AROUND
MR BAILEY AND MY BROTHER KNOW NOTHING OF THIS
THINGS MUST BE LIVELY AT SUNNYSIDE I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS AT SUNNYSIDE
I DO NOT KNOW I CRIED BUT BE SURE OF THIS
WHEN THEY CAME OUT AFTER CLOSING THE SLIDING DOOR THEY CUT UP OVER THE RAILROAD EMBANKMENT TOWARD THE TOWN
BUT MATTHEW GEIST WHICH IS OUR FRIEND'S NAME CLAIMS THAT ON SATURDAY NIGHT AT NINE-THIRTY A VEILED LADY I KNEW IT WOULD BE A VEILED LADY I BROKE IN
NO I THINK NOT
IF THERE IS ANYTHING MORE I OUGHT TO KNOW THERE'S NOTHING MORE HE SAID EVASIVELY
IT IS ARNOLD ARMSTRONG HE SAID LOOKING AT ME ODDLY AND HE HAS BEEN MURDERED IN HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AFTER A MINUTE I GATHERED MYSELF TOGETHER AND MR JARVIS HELPED ME INTO THE LIVING-ROOM
THEN HE GAVE IT TO ME
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE SMILE I SNAPPED AT HER
THE PLOT THICKENS HE SAID WITH HIS READY SMILE
GERTRUDE LIFTED HER HEAD AT LAST AND STARED ACROSS THE TABLE AT HALSEY
O AUNT RAY
AS SECURITY FOR THE LOAN HE HAD DEPOSITED SOME THREE HUNDRED INTERNATIONAL STEAMSHIP COMPANY 5'S IN TOTAL VALUE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
I TRIED TO PUT THE THOUGHT AWAY BUT IT WOULD NOT GO
THE COOK WAS IN BED COMPLETELY DEMORALIZED SHE REPORTED AND LIDDY BRAVE WITH THE DAYLIGHT WAS LOOKING FOR FOOTPRINTS AROUND THE HOUSE
I THINK--IT WAS SHE--WHO SCREAMED LIDDY HAD JOINED US NOW CARRYING A LIGHT
ONE DAY I THOUGHT GERTRUDE KNEW OR AT LEAST SUSPECTED THAT JACK HAD DONE IT
THERE WAS A TELEGRAM THAT MORNING FROM GERTRUDE
A SOFT HAT LAY BESIDE IT AND THE COLLAR OF THE DINNER-COAT WAS STILL TURNED UP
I DID NOT CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO NOTIFY MRS ARMSTRONG IN THE VILLAGE
IF I HAD ONLY KNOWN HOW TO READ THE PURPOSE OF THAT GAPING APERTURE WHAT I MIGHT HAVE SAVED IN ANXIETY AND MENTAL STRAIN
LOUISE HE SAID SOFTLY
SO I BROKE IN ON MRS FITZHUGH'S VOLUBLE EXCUSES FOR DISTURBING ME
I WOULD SAY AS LITTLE TO THOMAS AS POSSIBLE
THEN AWARE OF ALEX'S STARE I TURNED ON LIDDY
SWEETHEART AS LONG AS YOU CARE FOR ME I AM NOT AFRAID THE WIND SLAMMED THE DOOR BETWEEN THE TWO ROOMS JUST THEN AND I COULD HEAR NOTHING MORE ALTHOUGH I MOVED MY CHAIR QUITE CLOSE
JUST WHAT I TOLD YOU MISS INNES
THAT THE BAD OMEN HAD BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE HAD DROPPED THE TRAY
IT WAS MONEY THEN HE DROPPED HIS PULPIT MANNER AND TURNING TO ME WITH HIS ENGAGING SMILE
I DO NOT BELIEVE IT MISS INNES
ANNIE MORTON IS GOING TO SCOTLAND NEXT WEEK AND YOU SHALL GO RIGHT WITH HER TO MY SURPRISE SHE FLUSHED PAINFULLY
I LEFT MR JAMIESON AND THE DAY DETECTIVE GOING OVER EVERY INCH OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE POUNDING PROBING AND MEASURING
PART-WAY UP THE ROAD A MAN STEPPED OUT OF THE BUSHES AND HELD HIS ARM LIKE THIS SPREAD OUT SO I COULDN'T GET PAST
ONE OF THE MEN GAVE AN EXCLAMATION AND THEY ALL HURRIED ACROSS THE ROOM
DOCTOR HAS ANY ONE COME TO YOU EITHER EARLY THIS MORNING OR TO-DAY TO HAVE YOU TREAT A BULLET WOUND NOTHING SO STARTLING HAS HAPPENED TO ME HE SAID
OVER AT THE CLUB THE GENTLEMEN BUT THOMAS DID NOT FINISH
AND THEN I TOOK THE CAR ALONG THE LOWER ROAD NOT TO DISTURB THE HOUSEHOLD
THE CORONER'S INQUEST ON THE DEATH OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG TO BE HELD SATURDAY AND THE ARRIVAL OF MRS ARMSTRONG AND YOUNG DOCTOR WALKER BRINGING THE BODY OF THE DEAD PRESIDENT OF THE TRADERS BANK
WHAT'S WRONG THE JARVIS MAN ASKED--AND WE MADE A STRANGE PICTURE NO DOUBT
IN SPITE OF ALL THIS LUXURY HE SAID THE COUNTRY PEOPLE HERE HAVE A SAYING THAT MR PAUL ARMSTRONG COULD SIT ON A DOLLAR AND SEE ALL AROUND IT
HE HAD BEEN STAYING AT THE CLUB-HOUSE ACROSS THE VALLEY FOR THE LAST WEEK JARVIS TELLS ME BUT THAT ONLY EXPLAINS HOW HE CAME HERE NOT WHY
I HAVE AN IDEA HE SAID APROPOS OF NOTHING AT ALL THAT AT ANY RATE THE GHOST IS LAID HERE
AT THE LAST MOMENT HIS PLANS HAD BEEN FRUSTRATED
IF EITHER HE OR JACK BAILEY HAD HEARD AN INTRUDER IN THE HOUSE AND SHOT HIM--AS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED IN DOING--WHY HAD THEY RUN AWAY
ON THE FOLLY OF A ONE-MAN BANK AND OF A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT MET ONLY TO LUNCH TOGETHER AND TO LISTEN TO A BRIEF REPORT FROM THE CASHIER AND ON THE POOR POLICY OF A GOVERNMENT THAT ARRANGES A THREE OR FOUR-DAY EXAMINATION TWICE A YEAR
WHY WAS THE DOCTOR SO AFRAID OF HER
IT WAS ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK I THINK WHEN THE BELL RANG AND HE WAS USHERED INTO THE LIVING-ROOM
IF THE PIPES IN THE ROOF WERE VENTILATORS TO THE SECRET ROOM AND THERE WAS NO TRAP-DOOR ABOVE THE ENTRANCE WAS PROBABLY IN ONE OF THE TWO ROOMS BETWEEN WHICH IT LAY--UNLESS INDEED THE ROOM HAD BEEN BUILT AND THE OPENING THEN CLOSED WITH A BRICK AND MORTAR WALL
MR JAMIESON'S EYES NEVER LEFT HALSEY'S FACE
HE HAD DIED AS WINTERS REACHED HIM
HE HAD CUT HIS FOREHEAD A LITTLE ON THE LOWEST STEP OF THE STAIRS AND HE WAS RATHER A GHASTLY SIGHT
I WENT IN AND AROUSED HER AND I GIVE HER CREDIT FOR BEING WIDE AWAKE THE MINUTE I SPOKE
AS HALSEY SAID WHEN WE TOLD HIM IT DIDN'T MATTER MUCH ABOUT THE COOK'S FACE IF IT WAS CLEAN
JACK SHE CRIED OH JACK LIDDY HAD RUN SCREAMING AND THE TWO OF US WERE THERE ALONE
BESIDES THIS IS NO PLACE FOR QUIET AND PEACE JUST NOW
THEN HE HELD IT ON HIS EXTENDED PALM FOR ME TO SEE
AND YET YOUR MAID AFFIRMS WITH EQUAL POSITIVENESS THAT IT WAS A MAN NONSENSE I BROKE IN
WHAT SORT OF MAN WAS MR PAUL ARMSTRONG ANYHOW HE WAS A BULLY AS WELL AS A RASCAL GERTRUDE I SAID
I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO COMFORT HER BUT SHE HAD PUT ME AWAY AND THERE WAS SOMETHING ALOOF IN HER GRIEF SOMETHING NEW AND STRANGE
TEN MINUTES PASSED FIFTEEN TWENTY
I AM GOING TO READ BUT LIDDY SET HER LIPS TIGHT AND STOOD STILL
I MUST MAKE A DOUBLE EXCUSE FOR THIS EARLY VISIT MISS INNES HE SAID AS HE SAT DOWN
WILL YOU COME WITH ME FOR A MOMENT MISS INNES HE ASKED SOBERLY AND ON MY ASSENTING HE LED THE WAY TO THE EAST WING
SHE WAS NO LONGER FRANK WITH ME ALTHOUGH I THINK HER AFFECTION NEVER WAVERED
IN SPITE OF A RUMOR AMONG THE SERVANTS ABOUT STRANGE NOISES--I CITED THOMAS--NOTHING HAD OCCURRED THE FIRST TWO NIGHTS
MRS ARMSTRONG ASKED ME TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO LOUISE WHOSE WHIM OCCURRING AT THE TIME IT DID PUT HER TO GREAT INCONVENIENCE
BUT THE CATASTROPHE AT THE BANK OCCURRED SOONER THAN HE HAD EXPECTED
OR PERHAPS IT'S THE ONE THE MILK-BOY HEARD
GERTRUDE WAS STANDING THERE TRYING TO LOCATE THE SHOTS AND I MUST HAVE BEEN A PECULIAR FIGURE WITH MY HAIR IN CRIMPS MY DRESSING-GOWN FLYING NO SLIPPERS AND A REVOLVER CLUTCHED IN MY HANDS I HAD NO TIME TO TALK
I HAD ONLY A SECOND
VERY WELL MR INNES SHE SAID
SEEING HER SUSPICIONS WERE VERIFIED MARY ANNE HAD GONE WHITE AND STOOD WITH HER EYES SHIFTING MORE WILDLY THAN EVER
HE SAID HE HAD WASTED A LOT OF TIME ON THE CASE AND A GOOD BIT OF THE MYSTERY WAS IN MY IMAGINATION
GERTRUDE SELDOM LOSES HER PRESENCE OF MIND AND SHE RAN TO THE TELEPHONE
I REMEMBER WHISPERING TO MR JAMIESON THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN THE STARS SO LOVELY AND THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE WHEN THE LORD HAD MADE THE NIGHT SO BEAUTIFUL TO SLEEP THROUGH IT
HALSEY THREW ME OFF THEN AND STRODE FORWARD
WHY IT'S EVERYTHING YOU WANT HALSEY SAID VIEW AIR GOOD WATER AND GOOD ROADS
NO I WANT TO ASK THIS YOUNG WALKER SOMETHING SHE WAS CURIOUS I KNEW BUT I DID NOT WAIT TO EXPLAIN
THE CURTAIN CONFUSED HIM FOR A MOMENT
TO PROVIDE ONLY ONE POSSIBLE ENTRANCE FOR THE INVADER AND TO KEEP A CONSTANT GUARD IN THE DARK AT THE FOOT OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY METHOD
HALSEY SAT ON THE RAIL WITH A PIPE OPENLY WATCHING LOUISE AS SHE LOOKED BROODINGLY ACROSS THE VALLEY TO THE HILLS
WHEN DID THEY LEAVE VERY EARLY--I DON'T KNOW AT JUST WHAT TIME MR JAMIESON TURNED SUDDENLY AND LOOKED AT ME
THEN SHE CAUGHT ME BY THE ARM AND DRAGGED ME TOWARD THE STAIRS
THAT ONE TIME I ELUDED HIM
MINE GERTRUDE WAS DEFIANT NOW
BUT THERE WERE NO LARGE PIECES OF MORTAR LYING AROUND--NO BITS OF LATHING
ONCE OUT THERE ACCESS TO THE TOP OF THE MAIN BUILDING WAS RENDERED EASY--AT LEAST IT LOOKED EASY--BY A SMALL VERTICAL IRON LADDER FASTENED TO THE WALL OUTSIDE OF THE BALL-ROOM AND PERHAPS TWELVE FEET HIGH
BY JOVE I BELIEVE YOU WERE RIGHT IN THE COURSE OF HIS INVESTIGATIONS THE DETECTIVE HAD COME TO THE INNER POCKET OF THE DEAD BUTLER'S BLACK COAT
THE PROPERTY WAS AN EXTENSIVE ONE
PART OF THE AFTERNOON I BELIEVE HE READ--GERTRUDE AND I WERE OUT AS I HAVE SAID AND AT DINNER WE BOTH NOTICED THAT SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED TO DISTRACT HIM
IF YOU HAD KILLED MR ARMSTRONG YOU WOULD HAVE LEFT NO CLUES
HER SCRUPLES SEEMED TO FADE HOWEVER ALL AT ONCE
THREE SMALL CHILDREN WERE DISPUTING VOCIFEROUSLY AND A FADED YOUNG WOMAN WITH A KINDLY FACE WAS TRYING TO HUSH THE CLAMOR
NINA CARRINGTON NINA CARRINGTON THE ROAR AND RUSH OF THE WHEELS SEEMED TO SING THE WORDS
YOU DESERVE IT
IS THE GENTLEMAN DOWN IN THE TOWN MR JAMIESON LOUISE SAID IMPULSIVELY I CAN USE THE HACK
NINA CARRINGTON N
HE WAS UP AND OFF AGAIN WITHOUT ANY PERCEPTIBLE PAUSE AND HE LEAPED THE HEDGE--WHICH I AM SURE UNDER ORDINARY STRESS WOULD HAVE BEEN A FEAT FOR A MAN
THEN HE TOLD US
THEN SEEING NOBODY HE RAISED HIS EYES
I REMEMBER PLANNING IF I WERE NOT DISCOVERED WHO WOULD HAVE MY THINGS
THE INNER HISTORY HAS NEVER BEEN TOLD
WHEN THE CORONER CALLED MR JOHN BAILEY THE ROOM WAS FILLED WITH SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT
DOCTOR STEWART CAME ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK BRINGING HIS LEATHER SATCHEL INTO THE HOUSE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CARE AND OPENING IT AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TO SHOW ME A DOZEN BIG YELLOW EGGS NESTING AMONG THE BOTTLES
I HAD OTHER THINGS TO ABSORB ME AT THAT TIME
I WENT FIRST TO DOCTOR WALKER'S
THEN HE STOPPED
I IMAGINED I COULD HEAR THE SEARCH GOING ON THROUGH THE HOUSE AND ONCE SOME ONE CAME INTO THE TRUNK-ROOM
SHE BROKE AWAY IN A FRENZY OF RAGE AND FEAR AND GOT INTO THE HOUSE WHILE GERTRUDE AND JACK BAILEY WERE AT THE FRONT DOOR
NO TRAP-DOOR REVEALED ITSELF NO GLASS WINDOW
DID YOU EVER LONG AND LONG FOR MONEY--MONEY TO USE WITHOUT QUESTION MONEY THAT NO ONE WOULD TAKE YOU TO TASK ABOUT
VERY WELL I SAID THEN I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE YOU HERE
I BROUGHT THE BLANKET THOMAS I SAID
AND A BILLIARD CUE
IF IT WERE SWOLLEN WITH RAIN IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
I HAD TORN A GREAT STRIP OF THE SILK LOOSE AND NOW I RUTHLESSLY FINISHED THE DESTRUCTION OF MY GOWN BY JERKING IT FREE AND TYING IT AROUND MY HEAD
SHE HAS BEEN VERY ILL
I WENT AT ONCE ACROSS THE HALL TO HALSEY'S ROOM AND KNOCKED
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE STRONGER I SAID GENTLY
LIDDY HAD GIVEN UP ALL PRETENSE AT BRAVERY AND SLEPT REGULARLY IN MY DRESSING-ROOM ON THE COUCH WITH A PRAYER-BOOK AND A GAME KNIFE FROM THE KITCHEN UNDER HER PILLOW THUS PREPARING FOR BOTH THE NATURAL AND THE SUPERNATURAL
ALTHOUGH NEITHER HAD ROSIE FOR THAT MATTER
BUT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT ALEX HIMSELF APPEARED AND WITH HIM A STRANGE AND REPULSIVE INDIVIDUAL
THE LIGHT WAS THICKENING TO APPROPRIATE SHAKESPEARE'S DESCRIPTION OF TWILIGHT AND ONCE AGAIN THE TREE-TOADS AND THE CRICKETS WERE MAKING NIGHT THROB WITH THEIR TINY LIFE
I WISH YOU WOULD TRY TO LOOK CHEERFUL LIDDY I GROANED YOUR FACE WOULD SOUR MILK BUT LIDDY SELDOM REPLIED TO MY GIBES

AUNT RAY HE BEGAN EXTINGUISHING HIS CIGARETTE ON THE BACK OF MY IVORY HAIR-BRUSH I WOULD GIVE A LOT TO TELL YOU THE WHOLE THING
I TOOK IT FROM HER AND SENT HER UP FOR DRY GARMENTS
FOR ONE AWFUL MOMENT I THOUGHT THE HOUSE WAS ON FIRE AND EVERY DROP OF BLOOD IN MY BODY GATHERED AROUND MY HEART
NOT A WORD OR SIGN TO ALEX IF HE COMES BACK HE SAID CAUTIOUSLY
WITH THIS REMARKABLE INSIGHT OF YOURS I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME WHERE I SHALL FIND MY FOUR-THOUSAND-DOLLAR MOTOR CAR I WAS JUST COMING TO THAT HE SAID
IT WAS VERY DARK BUT THEY COULD MAKE OUT TWO FIGURES STANDING TOGETHER
SO NOW I FELT NO HESITATION IN CALLING HIM OVER THE TELEPHONE
WE WAITED A MOMENT
HE CAME WITH SOME HESITATION HE WENT ON TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN FURTHER INSTRUCTED TO ASK ME TO RELINQUISH MY LEASE ON SUNNYSIDE AS IT WAS MRS ARMSTRONG'S DESIRE TO COME DIRECTLY THERE
THIS HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE SHOCK
THE DETECTIVE WENT BACK TO TOWN EARLY IN THE EVENING AND BY NINE O'CLOCK HALSEY WHO HAD BEEN PLAYING GOLF--AS A MAN DOES ANYTHING TO TAKE HIS MIND AWAY FROM TROUBLE--WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY ON THE BIG LEATHER DAVENPORT IN THE LIVING-ROOM
SOME DAY BEFORE LONG YOU WILL BE GLAD THEN IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEVER LOVED ME THERE WERE DEPTHS OF HURT PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
THEN SECURE IN MY PRECAUTIONS I WENT TO BED
SHE DRIFTED AROUND DOING PLAIN SEWING AND KEEPING A HOME SOMEWHERE ALWAYS FOR THE BOY
EXCEPT A FEW BITS OF SPLINTERED WOOD ON THE GROUND THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE ACCIDENT
AS FOR THE MURDER OF THE BANK PRESIDENT'S SON I WAS OF TWO MINDS
THE HOUSE SEEMED TO CHOKE ME AND SLIPPING A SHAWL AROUND ME I WENT OUT ON THE DRIVE
SAM BOHANNON CAME AT A QUARTER BEFORE NINE AND BEGAN HIS PATROL OF THE GROUNDS AND WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE TWO DETECTIVES TO LOOK FORWARD TO I WAS NOT ESPECIALLY APPREHENSIVE
SHE WAS A CHAMBERMAID IN THE HOTEL AT C AND IT WAS EVIDENTLY HER INTENTION TO BLACKMAIL DOCTOR WALKER
LITTLE LUCIEN ARMSTRONG IS LIVING WITH HIS STEP-GRANDMOTHER AND SHE IS RECOVERING GRADUALLY FROM TROUBLES THAT HAD EXTENDED OVER THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF HER SECOND MARRIAGE
WHICH WAY HAD THE FUGITIVE ESCAPED
HE IS AS DEAR TO ME AS HE IS TO YOU SHE SAID SADLY
IN OFFICE TO CONCILIATE THE G
I HAVE BEEN HERE ONE WEEK DURING WHICH I HAVE HAD NOT A SINGLE NIGHT OF UNINTERRUPTED SLEEP AND I INTEND TO STAY UNTIL I HAVE RECUPERATED
I WENT TO THE DOCTOR'S ABOUT MIDNIGHT BUT HE HAD BEEN CALLED OUT ON A CASE AND HAD NOT COME BACK AT FOUR O'CLOCK
AT THE TOP OF THE FLIGHT HAD BEEN PLACED A TALL WICKER HAMPER PACKED WITH LINEN THAT HAD COME FROM TOWN
GERTRUDE THAT BLANKET IS NOT MINE
THE VOICES WERE AT THE BROKEN WINDOW NOW AND ALTHOUGH I WAS TREMBLING VIOLENTLY I WAS DETERMINED THAT I WOULD HOLD THEM UNTIL HELP CAME
YOU WOULD FIND NOTHING HE SAID
HE TOLD ME MORE OF HIMSELF THAN HE KNEW AND BEFORE HE LEFT I ASTONISHED HIM--AND MYSELF I ADMIT--BY PROMISING A NEW CARPET FOR HIS CHURCH
THE NIGHT LAMP BURNED DIMLY REVEALING THE EMPTINESS OF THE PLACE
IF IT WAS A GHOST IT WOULDN'T RAP
HE DID--STRANGE THINGS SOMETIMES AND I TURNED AROUND
LOUISE LAY UNDER A FIELD OF VIRGIN WHITE FOLDED BACK AT AN ANGLE OF GEOMETRICAL EXACTNESS AND NECESSITATING A READJUSTMENT EVERY TIME THE SICK GIRL TURNED
UNFORTUNATELY THERE HAD BEEN TROUBLE BETWEEN ARNOLD AND HIS FATHER
LOUISE WAS OUT OF DANGER BUT VERY ILL AND A TRAINED NURSE GUARDED HER LIKE A GORGON
HE NEVER BUILT A HOUSE YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT
IT--IT WAS YOURS HALSEY FOR AN APPRECIABLE MOMENT HALSEY STARED AT ME
I HAVE THE BAREST ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER--SHE MANAGED TO BE PUT ON THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE OLD LADIES HOME AND RUINS THEIR DIGESTIONS BY SENDING THEM ICE-CREAM AND CAKE ON EVERY HOLIDAY
ALMOST BESIDE ME WAS THE CLOTHES CHUTE
GERTRUDE HAD GONE TO BED HAVING BEEN UP ALMOST ALL NIGHT AND HALSEY WAS ABSENT ON ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS ABSENCES OF HIS THAT GREW MORE AND MORE FREQUENT AS TIME WENT ON UNTIL IT CULMINATED IN THE EVENT OF THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE TENTH
I GOT HER INTO THE HOUSE AND SECURED THE PLATE
I HAD TAKEN THE HOUSE FOR THE SUMMER I SAID WHILE THE ARMSTRONGS WERE IN CALIFORNIA
SHE LAID OUT MY THINGS AS USUAL BUT I MISSED HER CUSTOMARY GARRULOUSNESS
PLASTER IS ALWAYS FALLING BUT LIDDY CLENCHED THAT
AS ALEX AND I REACHED THE SECOND FLOOR MR JAMIESON MET US
I FELT MYSELF GOING FELT SOME ONE CATCH ME A HORRIBLE NAUSEA--THAT WAS ALL I REMEMBERED
HE MUST HAVE BEEN ADMITTED FROM WITHIN
IT WAS CLOSED WITH A METAL FIRE FRONT AND ONLY WHEN THE FRONT REFUSED TO MOVE AND INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE MOVED DID MY SPIRITS REVIVE
BUT VERY SOON MR INNES AND ANOTHER GENTLEMAN LEFT USING THE CAR
AND WHAT I HAVE TAKEN FROM HER IN THE WAY OF SULKS!--"BUT I GUESS I CAN'T STAND IT ANY LONGER
THE PAPERS REPORTED THAT THE CASHIER OF THE TRADERS BANK WAS ILL IN HIS APARTMENTS AT THE KNICKERBOCKER--A CONDITION NOT SURPRISING CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
GERTRUDE AND I SAT WELL BACK WITH OUR VEILS DOWN
I SAW HER STOP SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK
WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE DREW A LONG BREATH
I'M WORSE THAN A PAUPER NOW
TIME WAS TO ANSWER ALL THESE THINGS
THOMAS SAID THE DETECTIVE NOT UNKINDLY I SENT FOR YOU TO TELL US WHAT YOU TOLD SAM BOHANNON AT THE CLUB THE DAY BEFORE MR ARNOLD WAS FOUND HERE DEAD
WHATEVER HAS GONE BEFORE WHATEVER IS TO COME IN ETERNITY THAT PARTICULAR TEMPLE OF THE SOUL HAS BEEN GIVEN BACK TO THE ELEMENTS FROM WHICH IT CAME
I AM TALKING OF RENTING A HOUSE NEXT YEAR AND LIDDY SAYS TO BE SURE THERE IS NO GHOST
NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO SHE SENT FOR ARNOLD AT THE GREENWOOD CLUB AND TOLD HIM A LITTLE NOT ALL
ITS INTEREST FOR ME LAY IN THIS
AT THE DOOR OF THE LIVING-ROOM I PAUSED
SHE DOES NOT KNOW OF EITHER DOCTOR I SAID
IT WAS NO PLACE FOR AN ELDERLY SPINSTER
ONLY A HALF-HOUR BEFORE I HAD SAT WITH MR JAMIESON IN THAT VERY ROOM LISTENING WHILE HE OVERTLY ACCUSED BOTH GERTRUDE AND HALSEY OF AT LEAST A KNOWLEDGE OF THE DEATH OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG
AND NOW CAN'T YOU SEE WHERE THIS THING PUTS ME
BAILEY WORKED UNTIL MIDNIGHT THEN HE CLOSED THE VAULT AND WENT AWAY
I CAN NOT TELL YOU WHY--JUST YET
WHILE THIS INVOLVED THE LATE PRESIDENT OF THE WRECKED BANK TO MY MIND IT BY NO MEANS CLEARED ITS CASHIER
WAS HE ALONE IN HIS GUILT OR WAS THE CASHIER HIS ACCOMPLICE
TWICE I OPENED MY MOUTH
PERHAPS IT WAS SOME SUCH MEMORY THAT MADE ME CALL OUT SHARPLY
IN THE CHIMNEY I CALLED WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND WAS REWARDED BY A PIERCING SHRIEK FROM LIDDY AND THE SLAM OF THE TRUNK-ROOM DOOR
FROM WHAT WARNER SAYS AND FROM HIS HIDING IN THE CLOSET I SHOULD SAY HE WAS SCARED TO DEATH
IT WAS LIKE THIS MISS INNES SHE SAID AND SAY YOU WAS THE MAN
YOU AND--AND JACK LEFT ALMOST AT THE TIME IT HAPPENED
HALSEY WENT FOR THE CAR AND INSTEAD OF BRINGING IT TO THE HOUSE AND ROUSING PEOPLE HE WENT BY THE LOWER ROAD FROM THE STABLE
I WAS BREATHING LONG GASPING RESPIRATIONS AND MY FACE WAS DAMP AND CLAMMY
ROSIE IS MISSING LIDDY SAID WITH UNCTION
WHOSE BAG IS THIS HE STOPPED THEN BUT HE DID NOT TURN AROUND
I KNOW ABSOLUTELY AS LITTLE OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE AS YOU DO AND I CAN ONLY SAY THIS
THEN TOO THE RETURN OF HER MOTHER WOULD MEAN OF COURSE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE US AND I HAD BECOME GREATLY ATTACHED TO HER
ALEX BEHIND ME MUTTERED SOMETHING I COULD NOT HEAR AND BRUSHED PAST ME WITHOUT CEREMONY
MR TRAUTMAN WAS TOLD THAT THROUGH AN OVERSIGHT THE BONDS HAD BEEN MISPLACED AND WAS ASKED TO RETURN THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHEN EVERYTHING WOULD BE MADE ALL RIGHT
BUT DEPEND ON IT MR JAMIESON HALSEY WILL BE BACK HIMSELF TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING I SINCERELY HOPE SO HE SAID
REMEMBER--I SHALL BE DOWN THERE
IN THE DEAD SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED IT THROBBED AS IF IT WOULD BURST
OUR RECEPTION WAS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AT DOCTOR STEWART'S
I'D BIN HAVIN TOKENS--I TOL MIS INNES SOME OF EM--AN I SLEP IN THE LODGE
YES SHE COULD COOK
COMMON ENOUGH BUT HE LOVED MONEY NOT FOR WHAT IT WOULD BUY BUT FOR ITS OWN SAKE
IT HAD BEEN A METHODICAL GHOST
IT WAS A BLACK VOID FULL OF TERRIBLE SUGGESTION AND MY CANDLE ONLY EMPHASIZED THE GLOOM
STOP HERE GERTRUDE I SAID
MR JAMIESON HAD COME INTO THE HALL AND WE ALL STARED AT WARNER
ACCOMPANIED PERHAPS BY RIGGS WHO HAD SHOWN HIMSELF NOT OVERSCRUPULOUS UNTIL HE QUARRELED WITH HIS EMPLOYER HE HAD GONE ACROSS TO THE RAILROAD EMBANKMENT AND BY JUMPING IN FRONT OF THE CAR HAD CAUSED HALSEY TO SWERVE
YOU DON'T KNOW LOUISE REPEATED DULLY
YOU ARE LAYING UP TREASURE MISS INNES HE SAID BROKENLY WHERE NEITHER MOTH NOR RUST CORRUPT NOR THIEVES BREAK THROUGH AND STEAL IT IS CERTAINLY A SAFER PLACE THAN SUNNYSIDE I ADMITTED
SHE HAS A TELESCOPIC EYE MR JAMIESON LOOKED THOUGHTFUL
IN THIS WAY WE WALKED FOR PERHAPS TWENTY MINUTES
THE MURDER OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS STILL UNAVENGED AND I REMAINED FIRM IN THE POSITION I HAD TAKEN--TO STAY AT SUNNYSIDE UNTIL THE THING WAS AT LEAST PARTLY CLEARED
I GIVE IT AS SHE TOLD IT
I--I HAVE BEEN CHASED BY A THIEF MISS INNES DID HE CHASE YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE AND BACK AGAIN I ASKED
AFTERWARD HE TOLD ME THAT SHE HAD HAD A NARROW ESCAPE FROM PNEUMONIA AND THAT THE CEREBRAL SYMPTOMS HAD BEEN RATHER ALARMING
WARNER WHOSE BAG IS THIS HE WAS IN THE DOORWAY BY THIS TIME AND HE PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR
WHATEVER LOUISE DOES HE SAID NOTHING WILL CONVINCE ME AUNT RAY THAT SHE DOESN'T CARE FOR ME
BUT--AND HERE WAS THE THING THAT PUZZLED ME MOST--THE DOORS WERE ALL FASTENED THAT MORNING THE WINDOWS UNMOLESTED AND THE PARTICULAR DOOR FROM THE CARD-ROOM TO THE VERANDA HAD A COMBINATION LOCK OF WHICH I HELD THE KEY AND WHICH HAD NOT BEEN TAMPERED WITH
ALSO--AND THIS IS A DELICATE MATTER--SHE ASKED ME TO APPEAL TO YOUR NATURAL SYMPATHY FOR HER AT THIS TIME AND TO ASK YOU IF YOU WILL NOT RECONSIDER YOUR DECISION ABOUT THE HOUSE
THEN WHEN HE HAD SHOT DOWN ARNOLD ARMSTRONG THAT NIGHT HE HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO EVILS
THE DETECTIVE WAS WAITING IN THE HALL AND I WAS ASTONISHED TO SEE DOCTOR STEWART WITH HIM
GERTRUDE WAS AHEAD AND IN THE CARD-ROOM SHE STOPPED HOLDING HER CANDLE HIGH
THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
MR JAMIESON GAVE AN EXCLAMATION OF DISGUST
YOU CAN LOCK UP THE REST OF THE HOUSE AND GO TO BED LIDDY I SAID SEVERELY
THAT HALSEY HAD BEEN FOULLY DEALT WITH AND THAT EVERY MINUTE LOST MIGHT BE FATAL
IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DETAIL THE FLUCTUATIONS OF HOPE AND DESPAIR AND NOT A LITTLE FEAR OF WHAT LAY BEYOND WITH WHICH I TWISTED AND TURNED THE KNOB
HE DID THE THING THAT WOULD IMMEDIATELY TURN PUBLIC OPINION IN HIS FAVOR AND SURRENDERED HIMSELF AS AN INNOCENT MAN
DOORS WERE SLAMMING PEOPLE WERE HURRYING THROUGH THE HALLS AND CERTAIN HIGH NOTES OF EXCITED VOICES PENETRATED TO ME SHRILLY
BUT DON'T STICK A LIGHTED PIPE IN YOUR POCKET AGAIN
MISS INNES LET ME RECONSTRUCT THAT EVENING AS I SEE IT
TO HIM THESE TREES AND LAWNS WERE NOT THE WORK OF GOD
MR JAMIESON KNEW HER AT ONCE ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT SEEN HER BEFORE
THERE WERE RUMORS THAT THE DEAD MAN'S ESTATE HAD BEEN A COMPARATIVELY SMALL ONE
IN DEPTH THE SPACE EXTENDED ONLY TO THE FLOORING
YOU HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THE LIBRARY PAPER-BASKET AGAIN LIDDY WAS ARRANGING HER BITS OF PAPER WITH THE SKILL OF LONG PRACTICE AND PAID NO ATTENTION
AND SOMETIMES I TAKE OUT HIS PICTURE WITH ITS CANE AND ITS QUEER SILK HAT AND LOOK AT IT
SO LOUISE HAD FLED FROM HER PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND HAD COME EAST ALONE
IT'S NO PLACE FOR A WOMAN I HEARD HIM PROTESTING ANGRILY
I HAD GONE UP-STAIRS ALONE AND I CONFESS THE THING PUZZLED ME
I TELL YOU BOTH AS SURE AS I STAND HERE I BELIEVE THAT PAUL ARMSTRONG LOOTED HIS OWN BANK
I RENTED THE HOUSE AT AN EXORBITANT FIGURE AND I HAVE MOVED OUT HERE FOR THE SUMMER
SHE HAD ROLLED DOWN HER SLEEVES AND TIED A WHITE APRON AROUND HER WAIST AND SHE STOOD MAKING FOLDS IN IT WITH FINGERS THAT WERE RED AND SHINY FROM HER SOAP-SUDS
THEN SHE CAME OVER AND PUT HER HAND LOVINGLY IN MINE
FIRST BIG FIRE WE'VE HAD SINCE THE SUMMER HOUSE BURNED OVER TO THE CLUB GOLF LINKS
THERE WILL BE TWO MORE MEN HERE BY NOON AND THE CITY OFFICE IS ON THE LOOKOUT THE CREEK GERTRUDE ASKED
AND GERTRUDE'S STORY OF A TELEPHONE MESSAGE POOR TRUDE HE HALF WHISPERED
ON FRIDAY NIGHT THEN I HAD GONE TO BED RESOLVED TO GO AT ONCE TO SLEEP
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TOO MUCH INTELLIGENCE AFTER THAT WE GOT ALONG BETTER
WHAT AM I TO THINK HALSEY LEANED OVER AND PATTED MY HAND
THE HOLE'S THERE ALL RIGHT MISS INNES SHE SAID
WITH THE DEATH OF HER STEPFATHER AND THE PROSPECT OF THE IMMEDIATE RETURN OF THE FAMILY THINGS HAD BECOME MORE AND MORE IMPOSSIBLE
IT WASN'T MY BUSINESS TO UNDERSTAND IT FOR THAT MATTER
THE GUILTY MAN WILL BE KNOWN IN A DAY OR SO I SHALL BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT IS PROVED I SAID GRIMLY
I WAS SURPRISED
THE WOUNDS COULD HAVE BEEN SELF-INFLICTED BUT WITH DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO WEAPON FOUND
POOR HALSEY SHE SAID SOFTLY
LOUISE IS HERE WITH ME THERE WAS A CLATTER OF EJACULATIONS AT THE OTHER END OF THE WIRE
AT HALF AFTER NINE GROWING WEARY OF MY OWN COMPANY I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO FIND THE YOUNG PEOPLE
IF ELIZA GOES I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER COOK MORE SILENCE
I FOLLOWED--IT WAS DARK--BUT AS I TURNED THE CORNER AT THE TOP A FIGURE DARTED THROUGH THIS DOOR AND CLOSED IT
IS THAT YOU LIDDY I ASKED MY HAND ON THE KNOB
AND THEN WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST WARNING THE CARD-ROOM WINDOW BROKE WITH A CRASH
ABOVE HER PLAIN BLACK GOWN HER EYES LOOKED BIG AND SOMBER AND THE RAPID DRIVE HAD BROUGHT NO COLOR TO HER FACE
BUT AS IT HAPPENS IT WAS
THERE WAS A QUEER FEELING OF PHYSICAL NAUSEA COMING OVER ME
HALSEY HAD NOT COME BACK AND THERE WAS NO WORD FROM THE DETECTIVE
I PICKED MY WAY GINGERLY OVER THROUGH THE DEW AND STOOPED DOWN
WHY AT A QUARTER TO THREE LISTEN SHE SAID
HE FOUND OUT WHERE THE CHILD WAS HIDDEN AND THREATENED TO TAKE HIM AWAY
TWO DOLLARS HE SAID IN REPLY TO MY QUESTION
I WARNED LIDDY NOT TO MENTION WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ANYBODY AND TELEPHONED TO TOWN FOR SERVANTS
SHE WAS A VERY UNRELIABLE PERSON
DEAR OLD THOMAS HAS BEEN ALMOST CRAZY MISS INNES
THE MURDER OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS A BEGINNING NOT AN END HE LOOKED SERIOUS
DID YOU EVER SEE THIS CUFF-LINK BEFORE NO HE NEVER HAD HE SAID BUT HE LOOKED AT IT ODDLY
HALSEY HAD BEEN HALF CRAZED BY WHAT HE HEARD
THE OLD MAN LOOKS BAD TOO
BUT TO TAKE A BLANKET DOWN AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WITH EVERY PRECAUTION AS TO NOISE AND WHEN DISCOVERED TO FLING IT AT HALSEY AND BOLT--HALSEY'S WORD AND A GOOD ONE--INTO THE GROUNDS,--THIS MADE THE INCIDENT MORE THAN SIGNIFICANT
THOMAS ILL HE SAID OVER HIS SHOULDER
HE WAS SITTING ON THE PORCH STEP LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD AS IF HE SAW SOMETHING AMONG THE TREES ACROSS THE ROAD
MR JAMIESON CALLED THE HOSPITAL WHILE WE CROWDED AROUND HIM
WHY BECAUSE I AM UNEASY TO-NIGHT AND I TOLD HIM WHAT LIDDY HAD SAID
MR BAILEY WAS IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM
THEN I HEARD AN EXCLAMATION FROM HIM WHAT DID HE SAY DEMANDED JAMIESON
SEND ME AWAY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS AND YOUR NEW SHAWL ONLY HALF DONE AND NOBODY KNOWIN HOW TO FIX THE WATER FOR YOUR BATH IT'S TIME I LEARNED TO PREPARE MY OWN BATH I WAS KNITTING COMPLACENTLY
HE CALLED HER UP SHE SAID ORACULARLY HE CALLED HER UP AND ASKED HER TO KEEP YOU AT THE TELEPHONE SO HE COULD TALK TO MISS LOUISE
BUT WHAT
THE HOLE SLANTED DOWNWARD AND THE BULLET WAS EMBEDDED IN THE PORCH
I BELIEVE JUST AS SURELY THAT YOUNG WALKER BROUGHT HOME FROM CALIFORNIA THE KNOWLEDGE OF SOMETHING OF THE SORT AND FAILING IN HIS EFFORT TO REINSTALL MRS ARMSTRONG AND HER DAUGHTER HERE HE OR A CONFEDERATE HAS TRIED TO BREAK INTO THE HOUSE
MR ARMSTRONG HIMSELF CONSULTED ME AND THE INFERENCE WAS--IN FACT I AM QUITE CERTAIN--THE HOUSE WAS TO BE OCCUPIED BY MR ARMSTRONG'S DAUGHTER WHO WAS ENGAGED TO MARRY DOCTOR WALKER WHEN THE ARCHITECT HAD INQUIRED FOR THE DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY AND HAD FINALLY RUNG OFF I WAS CERTAIN OF ONE THING
NOT ONLY IN THE PLASTER BUT THROUGH THE LATHING THE APERTURE EXTENDED
I KNOW MISS GERTRUDE WENT BACK TO THE BILLIARD-ROOM TO GET SOMETHING SHE REFUSES TO SAY WHAT
ONE WAS A SHORT FELLOW
BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE
IT WAS NOT UNTIL I HAD RECOILED A STEP OR TWO THAT I RECOGNIZED GERTRUDE AND SHE ME
WARNER YOU HAD THE KEY TO THIS WHOLE OCCURRENCE IN YOUR HANDS AND DID NOT USE IT HOWEVER THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE
DOCTOR STEWART WAS CALLED FIRST
THERE HAD BEEN A TIME WHEN SAM WAS A GOOD DEAL YOUNGER THAN HE IS NOW BEFORE HE HAD MARRIED ANNE ENDICOTT WHEN I KNEW HIM EVEN BETTER
BUT THE MOST SURPRISING THING OF ALL WAS TO FIND THE BASKET SITTING COMFORTABLY BESIDE THE ROAD WITH THE REST OF THE BROKEN CROCKERY PILED NEATLY WITHIN AND A HANDFUL OF SMALL SILVER SPOON FORKS AND THE LIKE ON TOP
IT'S ABOUT THOMAS WHAT ABOUT THOMAS I ASKED
ATTEMPTS TO DISLODGE ME HAVING FAILED HE WAS DRIVEN TO BREAKING INTO HIS OWN HOUSE
SO FAR ROSIE'S STORY WAS BORNE OUT
I KNEW THAT ANOTHER HOUR OR TWO WOULD FIND ME UNCONSCIOUS AND WITH MY INABILITY TO CRY OUT WOULD GO MY ONLY CHANCE OF RESCUE
SOME ONE BRUSHED PAST ME AND I SCREAMED
I COULD HEAR THE THUMP-THUMP OF THE HAMMERS AND THEN I WAKED TO A KNOWLEDGE THAT SOMEBODY WAS POUNDING ON MY DOOR
I FULLY MEANT TO GO UP AND SEE HER THERE BUT OTHER THINGS DROVE HER ENTIRELY FROM MY MIND
SOME ONE IS TO PLAY BRIDGE TO-NIGHT AT NINE O'CLOCK I SAID
BETTER LUCK TO-MORROW AND HEARTSICK WE WOULD PUT UP THE RECEIVER AND SIT DOWN AGAIN TO OUR VIGIL
IT'S A CHINESE PUZZLE
AS IT CAME CLOSER I RECOGNIZED THE OUTLINE OF THE DRAGON FLY AND KNEW THAT HALSEY HAD COME BACK
I FOUND HIM STRIDING UP AND DOWN THE LIVING-ROOM AND IN SPITE OF MY PRECONCEIVED DISLIKE I HAD TO ADMIT THAT THE MAN WAS PRESENTABLE
I COULD NOT HAVE BORNE JUST THEN TO THINK THAT IT WAS MY POOR GERTRUDE WE HAD BEEN HOUNDING THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND YET--I HAD MET GERTRUDE NOT FAR FROM THAT VERY WINDOW
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS A SHOT AND SHE HAD RUN PANIC-STRICKEN THROUGH THE DRAWING-ROOM AND HAD ROUSED THE HOUSE
MISS INNES SHE SAID IN A LOW TONE IF THEY--IF THERE IS ANY ATTEMPT MADE TO--TO HAVE YOU GIVE UP THE HOUSE DO IT IF YOU POSSIBLY CAN
THERE WAS NO REASON ON EARTH WHY MRS WATSON SHOULD NOT HAVE CARRIED A BLANKET DOWN THE EAST WING STAIRCASE IF SHE SO DESIRED
GET UP I SAID IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE MURDERED IN YOUR BED WHERE
AS THE DETECTIVE FINISHED I SAW HALSEY PALE AND SHAKEN IN THE CARD-ROOM DOORWAY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT NIGHT I LOST MY SELF-CONTROL
HE SAT ON THE TOP STEP OF THE STAIRS ONLY LEAVING TO TELEPHONE FOR A DOCTOR AND GETTING IN EVERYBODY'S WAY IN HIS EAGERNESS TO FETCH AND CARRY
NONE OF YOUR ANEMIC STORE EGGS BUT THE REAL THING--SOME OF THEM STILL WARM
THEY MADE A QUEER PAIR FOR ALEX WAS ALMOST AS DISREPUTABLE AS THE TRAMP AND HE HAD A BADLY SWOLLEN EYE
PEOPLE WHO HAD THOUGHT TO BE SELF-SUPPORTING TO THE LAST FOUND THEMSELVES CONFRONTING THE POORHOUSE THEIR TWO OR THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR SAVINGS WIPED AWAY
LIDDY HAD FOUND IT LYING IN THE TOP OF THE HAMPER WHICH HAD BLOCKED THE EAST-WING STAIRS
IT WAS REPORTED THAT HE WOULD BE RELEASED UNDER ENORMOUS BOND SOME TIME THAT DAY TUESDAY
MY BEDROOM AND DRESSING ROOM WERE ABOVE THE BIG LIVING-ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR
UNTIL WE HAD GOT A LITTLE DISTANCE HE DID NOT SPEAK
I COULD NOT REMEMBER WHERE I WAS FOR A FEW MINUTES AND MY HEAD FELT HEAVY AND CONGESTED
AS TO TIME ONCE ON FRIDAY NIGHT A WEEK AGO AGAIN THE FOLLOWING NIGHT WHEN ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS MURDERED AND AGAIN LAST FRIDAY NIGHT THE DOCTOR LOOKED SERIOUS
WE WENT IN SINGLE FILE BETWEEN THE ROWS OF HEADSTONES AND ALTHOUGH WHEN I FOUND MYSELF LAST I HAD AN INSTINCTIVE DESIRE TO KEEP LOOKING BACK OVER MY SHOULDER I FOUND THAT THE FIRST UNEASINESS PAST A CEMETERY AT NIGHT IS MUCH THE SAME AS ANY OTHER COUNTRY PLACE FILLED WITH VAGUE SHADOWS AND UNEXPECTED NOISES
LIDDY AND I OFTEN DESIRE TO PART COMPANY BUT NEVER AT THE SAME TIME
I HAD NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE AND I WAS CERTAIN IT WAS NOT HALSEY'S
A GIRL WOULD BE BURIED ALIVE HERE IT WAS THEN SOME ONE RAPPED AT THE KNOCKER ON THE HEAVY FRONT DOOR
I ADMITTED I HAD FOUND THE BODY SAID I HAD NOT KNOWN WHO IT WAS UNTIL MR JARVIS TOLD ME AND ENDED BY LOOKING UP AT BARBARA FITZHUGH AND SAYING THAT IN RENTING THE HOUSE I HAD NOT EXPECTED TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY FAMILY SCANDAL
I'M GOING SHE MOVED AT THAT AND HOLDING TO MY SLEEVE WE FELT OUR WAY WITH NUMEROUS COLLISIONS TO THE BILLIARD-ROOM AND FROM THERE TO THE DRAWING-ROOM
I WAS VAGUELY IRRITATED WITH HER
I WOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF THEY WERE DOING THAT VERY THING LIDDY HE SAID WHEN HE GOT HIS BREATH
WITH NINA CARRINGTON FIVE LIVES WERE SACRIFICED IN THE COURSE OF THIS GRIM CONSPIRACY
I WAS TIRED OF BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH AND I FELT THAT THE KEY TO HALSEY'S DISAPPEARANCE WAS HERE AT CASANOVA IN SPITE OF MR JAMIESON'S THEORIES
THE LODGE WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE IN A GROVE OF TREES WHERE THE DRIVE MET THE COUNTY ROAD
I TOLD GERTRUDE THEN ABOUT THE TELEGRAM TO LOUISE WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ILL BEFORE
HOWEVER THE STORY HAD HAD NO INTEREST FOR ME
HE MIGHT HAVE STUMBLED INTO THE HOUSE HE SAID BUT HE COULD NOT HAVE CLIMBED THE STAIRS
HE WAS MET BY MR JARVIS WHO TOOK HIM AT ONCE TO THE EAST WING
ALL ARE NOT ELECTRICIANS WHO WEAR RUBBER GLOVES HE REFUSED TO EXPLAIN FURTHER BUT HE GOT A SLIP OF PAPER OUT OF HIS POCKETBOOK AND OPENED IT CAREFULLY
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT PUZZLES ME HE SAID STEPPING BEFORE ME
WE HAD NOT TOLD LOUISE OF EITHER DEATH
LOOK AT EM
MISS INNES HAS IT OCCURRED TO YOU THAT MR BAILEY MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING OF THIS GERTRUDE HAD COME DOWN-STAIRS AND JUST AS HE SPOKE SHE CAME IN
LIDDY WAS PUTTING MY CLOTHES INTO SHEETS PREPARATORY TO TOSSING THEM OUT THE WINDOW WHEN I FOUND HER AND I COULD HARDLY PERSUADE HER TO STOP
THEY TOOK THE HOUSE FURNISHED FOR THE SUMMER WHY IT'S A BANDBOX I SAID
THEREFORE--BUT WAS IT GERTRUDE
LIDDY IS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN SHE IS MAKING HERSELF WRETCHED AND NOW HER MOUTH DROOPED WHILE HER EYES WERE TRIUMPHANT
I THINK HE KILLED MR ARMSTRONG OUT IN THE WEST SOMEWHERE THAT'S WHAT I THINK
I GOT TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND OVER TO THE DOOR ON TO THE EAST VERANDA
I SAT DOWN MY FEET ON THE TOP RUNG AND PUT MY HAIR PINS IN MORE SECURELY WHILE THE WIND BELLOWED MY DRESSING-GOWN OUT LIKE A SAIL
CHAPTER XII ONE MYSTERY FOR ANOTHER THE MOST COMMONPLACE INCIDENT TAKES ON A NEW APPEARANCE IF THE ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE UNUSUAL
I FOUND IT IN THE BASKET IN MISS GERTRUDE'S DRESSING-ROOM
THE TWO LIFTED THE UNCONSCIOUS MAN INTO THE EMPTY BOX-CAR AND GETTING IN THEMSELVES STAYED FOR THREE OR FOUR MINUTES
THEN HE TURNED THE HANDLE
MR JAMIESON I HAVE REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT HE IS IN DANGER BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
IT WAS PLAIN HOW ALEX HAD SECURED THE WATCH
BY THE MAIN ENTRANCE
JUST ASK ALEX SHE SAID
LIDDY WAS BRUSHING MY HAIR AND GERTRUDE WAS DOING HER OWN WITH A LONG FREE SWEEP OF HER STRONG ROUND ARMS
THERE JUST AS HE HAD FALLEN WAS THE BODY OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG
THOMAS SAYS ONCE OR TWICE HE ALMOST BROKE INTO THE ROOM HE WAS SO ALARMED FOR LOUISE ANOTHER THING HALSEY I SAID HAVE YOU EVER HEARD LOUISE MENTION A WOMAN NAMED CARRINGTON NINA CARRINGTON NEVER HE SAID POSITIVELY
THOMAS CLAIMED IT WAS MR BAILEY WHOM HE HAD SEEN ON THE FOOT-PATH AND WHO OWNED THE PEARL CUFF-LINK
GERTRUDE HAD DROPPED ON A CHAIR AND SAT THERE LIMP AND SHIVERING
THE NEXT MORNING MRS WATSON WENT UP TO TOWN ON THE ELEVEN TRAIN AND WAS ADMITTED TO THE CHARITY HOSPITAL
THEN HE FORCED A SHORT LAUGH
SHE CARRIED NECESSARY PROVISIONS--LITTLE ENOUGH--TO THE LODGE AND HELPED TO KEEP THE SECRET
LITTLE THINGS THAT I HAD NOT NOTICED AT THE TIME NOW CAME BACK TO ME
WHEN HE PUT THE NEW COOK'S TRUNK THERE LAST NIGHT THE WALL WAS AS SMOOTH AS THIS
WHY SHE DOESN'T KNOW ME FUDGE I SNAPPED BEING APT TO GROW IRRITABLE WHEN MY SYMPATHIES ARE AROUSED
THAT WAS ALL HALSEY WANTED
WE SAT UNTIL LATE AFTERNOON HALSEY GROWING MORE AND MORE MOODY
LEAVE BEFORE ANYTHING OCCURS THAT WILL CAUSE YOU A LIFELONG REGRET I AM WILLING TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY I SAID COLDLY
IF I FOUND ANY SUCH WOMAN LOAFING AROUND I WAS NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF HER FOR A MINUTE UNTIL THE DOCTOR GOT BACK
AND THE THOUGHT OF THE CARPET PERMITTED HIM TO SMILE
I KNOW HIM WE SHOOK HANDS AND I GOT A CHANCE TO LOOK AT MR BAILEY
I GATHERED THAT THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR ENMITY AT THAT TIME IN ANNE'S MIND
ON WEDNESDAY EVENING MR JAMIESON WHO HAD BEEN DOWN AT THE ARMSTRONG HOUSE TRYING TO SEE LOUISE--AND FAILING--WAS MET NEAR THE GATE AT SUNNYSIDE BY AN INDIVIDUAL PRECISELY AS REPULSIVE AND UNKEMPT AS THE ONE ALEX HAD CAPTURED
WE DID NOT MENTION JACK BAILEY
AS SURE AS YOU SIT THERE THERE'S THE SMELL OF THE GRAVEYARD ON THEM
NICE FLINDERS--GOOD OLD BOY FLINDERS WAS CERTAINLY NOT A COMMON NAME FOR A HORSE AND YET THE YOUNGSTER AT RICHFIELD HAD NAMED HIS PRANCING CURLY-HAIRED LITTLE HORSE FLINDERS
HIS NAME WAS ON A SMALL SILVER PLATE ON THE HANDLE
I REMEMBERED A STORY I READ ONCE ABOUT AN IMPISH DWARF THAT LIVED IN THE SPACES BETWEEN THE DOUBLE WALLS OF AN ANCIENT CASTLE
WHEN I CAME AROUND LIDDY WAS RUBBING MY TEMPLES WITH EAU DE QUININE AND THE SEARCH WAS IN FULL BLAST
UP TO A CERTAIN POINT THE CAR HAD MADE IT EASY ENOUGH TO FOLLOW HIM
NEVER POPULAR HIS MEMORY WAS EXECRATED BY PEOPLE WHO HAD LOST NOTHING BUT WHO WERE FILLED WITH DISGUST BY CONSTANTLY HEARING NEW STORIES OF THE MAN'S GRASPING AVARICE
IF IT WAS A WOMAN YOU SAW THAT NIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOW WE MIGHT START WITH OTHER PREMISES
MARRIAGE HAD BEEN CONTEMPLATED FOR SOME TIME
HE WAS AN HONORED GUEST AT ALL THE WEDDINGS CHRISTENINGS AND FUNERALS--YES FUNERALS--FOR EVERY ONE KNEW HE HAD DONE HIS BEST AND THERE WAS NO GAINSAYING THE WAYS OF PROVIDENCE
THE DOOR BETWEEN GERTRUDE'S ROOMS AND MINE HAD BEEN OPENED AND WITH THE DOORS INTO THE HALL BOLTED WE WERE SAFE ENOUGH
I MIGHT JEER ALL I WISHED
I MADE UP MY MIND TO TELL THEM NOTHING
THEY WON'T FIT TOGETHER UNLESS--UNLESS MR BAILEY AND YOUR NEPHEW HAVE AGAIN AND ONCE AGAIN GERTRUDE SURPRISED ME
AUBREY TOOK HIS BRIDE TO CHICAGO WHERE THEY LIVED AT A HOTEL
I GATHERED THAT THOMAS WAS AS RELIEVED AS I AT THE TURN EVENTS HAD TAKEN
AT CASANOVA STATION I SAW THE STATION MASTER AND ASKED HIM IF ANY TRAINS LEFT CASANOVA BETWEEN ONE O'CLOCK AND DAYLIGHT
THEY WON'T STAND FOR THE COUNTRY AND THE LONESOMENESS I RECKON BUT WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE BUNCH OF SERVANTS MY COURAGE REVIVED AND LATE IN THE AFTERNOON CAME A MESSAGE FROM GERTRUDE THAT SHE AND HALSEY WOULD ARRIVE THAT NIGHT AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK COMING IN THE CAR FROM RICHFIELD
AFTER ALL WHAT HAD I TO TELL
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE
WE CAN TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED
WHAT WITH RELIEF AND JOY I BEGAN TO CRY RIGHT THERE AND VERY NEARLY WIPED MY EYES ON BEULAH IN THE EXCITEMENT
WHAT WAS THAT SOUND
WHEN GERTRUDE GOT PAST THE HAIR-RIBBON AGE AND HALSEY ASKED FOR A SCARF-PIN AND PUT ON LONG TROUSERS--AND A WONDERFUL HELP THAT WAS TO THE DARNING.--I SENT THEM AWAY TO GOOD SCHOOLS
I CAME TO INQUIRE ABOUT A CHILD NAMED LUCIEN WALLACE I AM GLAD YOU HAVE COME SHE SAID
I WAS NOT TO WRITE UNTIL SHE WROTE ME AND WHATEVER OCCURRED I WAS TO THINK THE BEST I COULD OF HER
DON'T MAKE IT WORSE
UNTIL THE NEXT DAY AND THEN TO MAKE AS LIGHT OF OUR EXCITEMENT AS POSSIBLE
MR JARVIS LEANED OVER TO ME
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THE MATTER WITH YOU I SNAPPED
HALSEY WAS ELEVEN THEN AND GERTRUDE WAS SEVEN
I--KNOW WHERE MR BAILEY IS AND MY BROTHER IS NOT WITH HIM THE DETECTIVE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HER KEENLY
AND WHILE I TOLD HER SHE STOOD LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW WITH A LOOK I COULD NOT FATHOM ON HER FACE
I SENT FOR LIDDY TO HELP HER TO BED AND THEN HALSEY AND I STARTED FOR THE LODGE
LIDDY WAS IN ATTENDANCE IN THE SICK-ROOM
THE KEY'S IN IT BUT THE KEY WAS NOT IN IT
IF LOUISE ARMSTRONG HAD A GOOD AND SUFFICIENT REASON FOR LEAVING HER PEOPLE AND COMING HOME A REASON MOREOVER THAT KEPT HER FROM GOING AT ONCE TO MRS OGDEN FITZHUGH AND THAT BROUGHT HER TO THE LODGE AT SUNNYSIDE INSTEAD IT WAS NOT MY INTENTION TO BETRAY HER
THEY HAD BEEN ADMITTED BY THE HOUSEKEEPER AND HAD FOUND THE BODY LYING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE
IT WAS ONLY AFTER THEY HAD GOT A FAIR IDEA OF THINGS AS THEY WERE THAT THEY SENT FOR ME
WE FOUND NOTHING AT ALL IN THE HOUSE AND I EXPECTED LITTLE FROM ANY EXAMINATION OF THE PORCH AND GROUNDS
HE TRIED TO OPEN THE DOOR BUT COULD NOT MOVE IT
APPARENTLY ONLY A FEW MINUTES ELAPSED DURING WHICH MY EYES WERE BECOMING ACCUSTOMED TO THE DARKNESS
NOT THE LEAST MYSTERIOUS THING WAS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE IRON IMPLEMENT THAT HAD BEEN USED
THE RAPPING OR POUNDING HAD CEASED AND THE SILENCE WAS ALMOST PAINFUL
LIKE A DOG ON A SCENT LIKE MY BEARSKIN PROGENITOR WITH HIS SPEAR AND HIS WILD BOAR TO ME NOW THERE WAS THE LUST OF THE CHASE THE FRENZY OF PURSUIT THE DUST OF BATTLE
ON THAT DAY IT SEEMED TO BE MORE THAN EVER A RESISTLESS IMPULSE THAT KEPT HIM OUT UNTIL AFTER LUNCHEON
THE PAPERS OF COURSE HAD GOT HOLD OF THE STORY AND WE WERE BESIEGED BY NEWSPAPER MEN
WHAT ARE YOUR--YOUR RELATIONS WITH MR BAILEY GERTRUDE HESITATED
YOU REFUSE TO TELL ME WHAT IT WAS
SHE DROOPED AND FRETTED AND ON THE BIRTH OF HER BABY BOY SHE HAD DIED
FOR A MOMENT I COULD NOT MOVE
YES SIR MRS TATE WE WANT TO MAKE SOME INQUIRIES
I TELL YOU JOHN BAILEY IS A GOOD MAN AN HONEST MAN
YOUR NEPHEW HAS APPARENTLY BEEN SPIRITED AWAY
IT BORE OUT MY THEORY OF THE SOUND WHICH HAD BEEN FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE THE BUMPING OF A METALLIC OBJECT DOWN A FLIGHT OF STEPS
RUN
THERE IS SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME
SOME ONE OUTSIDE SWORE ROUNDLY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I COULD HEAR WHAT WAS SAID
IT GAVE UNDER THE BLOWS ONLY TO SPRING BACK INTO PLACE AGAIN AND THE NECESSITY FOR CAUTION MADE IT DOUBLY HARD
THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING DEVELOPMENTS HERE HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY
AS FOR ME I LAY IN BED WITH EVERY FACULTY AWAKE
NEITHER YOU NOR I CAN JUDGE HER UNTIL WE KNOW EVERYTHING
NOW MISS INNES HE SAID GENTLY
IT TOOK MY MIND FROM HALSEY AND THE STORY WE HAD HEARD THE NIGHT BEFORE
IT WAS A WOMAN
I STOOD ON THE HUGE VERANDA AND WATCHED HIM SHUFFLE ALONG DOWN THE SHADOWY DRIVE WITH MINGLED FEELINGS--IRRITATION AT HIS COWARDICE AND THANKFULNESS AT GETTING HIM AT ALL
IT'S DOWN TO THIS AUNT RAY
WHEN I WAS A GIRL WE CALLED IN THE DOCTOR ALIKE WHEN WE HAD MEASLES OR WHEN MOTHER'S SISTER DIED IN THE FAR WEST
YOUNG WALKER'S CHAUFFEUR--WALKER'S MORE FASHIONABLE THAN I AM AND HE GOES AROUND THE COUNTRY IN A STANHOPE CAR--WELL HIS CHAUFFEUR COMES TO SEE OUR SERVANT GIRL AND HE TOLD HER THE WHOLE THING
AS SOON AS I CAN I AM GOING AWAY FROM HERE--WHERE YOU ARE ALL SO MUCH KINDER THAN I DESERVE
WHEN DOCTOR WALKER WENT AWAY TO CALIFORNIA WITH THE ARMSTRONG FAMILY THERE WAS TALK IN THE TOWN THAT WHEN HE CAME BACK HE WOULD BE MARRIED TO MISS ARMSTRONG AND WE ALL EXPECTED IT
THE INNESES ARE NOT ALWAYS SO SELF-DEPRECIATORY NOT ALWAYS NO HE SAID LOOKING AT ME WITH HIS BOYISH SMILE
I WISH YOU WOULD COME TO SUNNYSIDE AND SPEND A FEW DAYS THERE
JUST SAY THE LADY HAS COME THE LADY HAS COME REPEATED MRS TATE
WHAT HAD GERTRUDE LEFT IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM
ELM STREET WAS ALMOST THE ONLY STREET AND NUMBER FOURTEEN WAS EASILY FOUND
AS SOON AS I COULD I WENT UP TO THE TRUNK-ROOM WHICH WAS DIRECTLY OVER MY BEDROOM
THE PROPERTY WAS OWNED BY PAUL ARMSTRONG THE PRESIDENT OF THE TRADERS BANK WHO AT THE TIME WE TOOK THE HOUSE WAS IN THE WEST WITH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER AND A DOCTOR WALKER THE ARMSTRONG FAMILY PHYSICIAN
I UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME MR INNES HAS--DISAPPEARED YOU ARE QUIBBLING DOCTOR
DRAWN BY HUSTON IN TOWN
HE INSISTED ON CARRYING IT UP HIMSELF BUT AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS HE PAUSED
WATCH THE END STAIRCASES JAMIESON WAS SHOUTING
MAYBE MY LIVER WAS TORPID AND MAYBE IT WASN'T
THE NIGHT THE DETECTIVE ARRIVED SATURDAY I HAD A TALK WITH HIM
ALL TOGETHER NOW
DON'T YOU REMEMBER HALSEY LUCIEN WALLACE HALSEY SAID
IN THE SITTING-ROOM THE OLD NEGRO TURNED WITH QUIET DIGNITY TO HALSEY
THERE HAS BEEN NO RAIN
THE FIRM OF EXPERT ACCOUNTANTS WHO HAD EXAMINED THE BOOKS SOME TWO MONTHS BEFORE TESTIFIED THAT EVERY BOND EVERY PIECE OF VALUABLE PAPER WAS THERE AT THAT TIME
I'M NOT GOING TO BE MURDERED WITH MY EYES SHUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE MURDERED I RETORTED IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER THEY ARE SHUT OR OPEN
TELL HIM I AM OUT--FOR MERCY'S SAKE DON'T SAY I'M SICK
THAT'S THE DOOR SHE SAID SULKILY
FANNY ARMSTRONG WAS A WEAKLING BUT LOUISE WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE
IN FACT WE MERELY STARED AT EACH OTHER OVER THE WAITING-ROOM TABLE WITH ITS LITTER OF YEAR-OLD MAGAZINES
I AM ABOUT TO DISCOVER THAT I REPLIED AND HE WAS QUIET AT ONCE
THE REVOLVER--MY REVOLVER--THROWN INTO THE TULIP BED HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
THE STRANGE THING SEEMED TO BE HIS SURRENDERING HIMSELF ON THE POINT OF DEPARTURE
THEN HE SMILED A LITTLE AND GOT UP
SOME ONE WITH A KEY WAS WORKING WITH THE LATCH AND I THOUGHT OF COURSE OF HALSEY
THERE WAS NONE UNTIL SIX A.M
THEN HE TURNED TO GERTRUDE
STOP IT I WHISPERED
WHEN THE DOCTOR FROM ENGLEWOOD--THE CASANOVA DOCTOR DOCTOR WALKER BEING AWAY--HAD STARTED FOR SUNNYSIDE AND I HAD GOT THOMAS TO STOP TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIMSELF I HAD A LONG TALK WITH THE OLD MAN AND THIS IS WHAT I LEARNED
THE TRAMP WAS WARY
HERE I SAID
PLEASE COME IN HE SAID CURTLY
CERTAINLY IN DAYLIGHT SUNNYSIDE DESERVED ITS NAME
CHAPTER XXIII WHILE THE STABLES BURNED ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT LIDDY CAME INTO THE LIVING-ROOM AND REPORTED THAT ONE OF THE HOUSEMAIDS DECLARED SHE HAD SEEN TWO MEN SLIP AROUND THE CORNER OF THE STABLE
LAST THREE NIGHTS I SLEP IN THIS PLACE AFTER THE ELECTRICS WENT OUT I HAD A TOKEN
SHE WAS DEFIANT I THINK UNDER HER MASK OF SUBMISSION AND SHE STILL SHOWED THE EFFECT OF NERVOUS SHOCK
HAVE THE WHOLE RAT'S NEST ON US AND A LOT OF PROFANITY WHICH I WON'T WRITE DOWN
THERE WAS A MUTTERING OF VOICES OUTSIDE
I HED A VIEW OF IS WHITE DRESS SHIRT AN TIE AS I PASSED
GRADUALLY I FOUND THAT MY NAME SIGNED TO A CHECK WAS EVEN MORE WELCOME THAN WHEN SIGNED TO A LETTER THOUGH I WROTE THEM AT STATED INTERVALS
WARNER WAS PUZZLED
THIS IS HARDLY A WOMAN'S AFFAIR
IT MOVED EASILY REVEALING A SMALL BRASS KNOB
HIS EXPRESSION WAS VERY ODD WHEN HE LOOKED AT IT AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHAT OBJECT IF ANY SUCH A HOLE COULD HAVE
I HAVE NOT YET OUTLIVED LIDDY'S CONTEMPT BECAUSE I GAVE THEM SILVER KNIVES AND FORKS AS A WEDDING GIFT
WARNER BROUGHT UP THE AFTERNOON MAIL AND THE EVENING PAPERS AT SEVEN--I WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THE PAPERS SAID OF THE MURDER
I HAD ALL I COULD DO TO KEEP LIDDY FROM DROWNING HER WITH COLD WATER AND THE MAIDS HUDDLED IN A CORNER AS MUCH USE AS SO MANY SHEEP
WE HAD REDOUBLED OUR VIGILANCE AS TO BOLTS AND WINDOW-LOCKS BUT AS MR JAMIESON HAD SUGGESTED WE ALLOWED THE DOOR AT THE EAST ENTRY TO REMAIN AS BEFORE LOCKED BY THE YALE LOCK ONLY
YOU NEEDN'T BOTHER MRS WATSON
HAS YOUR FIRM MADE ANY PLANS FOR A HOUSE RECENTLY FOR A DOCTOR WALKER AT CASANOVA YES WE HAVE WHERE WAS IT TO BE BUILT
THERE ARE PLENTY OF WOMEN THERE I THINK THIS GAVE HIM SOMETHING TO PONDER FOR IN A SHORT TIME HE SAID GOOD NIGHT AND LEFT
SHE HAD FALLEN DOWN THE CLOTHES CHUTE AND BEEN SAVED BY THE BASKET BENEATH
IT WAS A CUE FROM THE BILLIARD-ROOM
PLEASE TRY TO REMEMBER
I FELT EASIER AFTER THAT ALTHOUGH THE ROOM WAS OPPRESSIVELY HOT AND ENERVATING
IN FACT IT HAS BEEN ENTERED
AT DAYLIGHT I DROPPED INTO EXHAUSTED SLEEP
LUCKILY THE ROOF WAS FLAT AND I WAS ABLE TO GO OVER EVERY INCH OF IT
NEAR THE GATE HOWEVER SHE MADE HIM STOP IN SPITE OF HIS REMONSTRANCES SAYING SHE PREFERRED TO WALK TO THE HOUSE
LIDDY CAME TO ME ON WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH HER BLACK SILK APRON HELD UP LIKE A BAG AND HER EYES BIG WITH VIRTUOUS WRATH
BEYOND THAT WAS THE DRAWING-ROOM AND IN THE END THE BILLIARD-ROOM
GERTRUDE SHUDDERED
SHORTLY AFTER ALEX REPORTED THAT HE WAS READY TO GO OVER THE HOUSE PREPARATORY TO CLOSING IT FOR THE NIGHT
IT LOOKS ALMOST LIKE AN ABDUCTION
ONCE IN A WHILE HE CAME OVER TO ME AND GAVE ME A REASSURING PAT ON THE SHOULDER
THEN I WENT TO BED
MY BOY HAD NOT BEEN MURDERED OUTRIGHT
JOHN BAILEY HAD KNOWN PAUL ARMSTRONG INTIMATELY
WE WENT INTO AN ALLEY AND I GOT THE WATCH THE TRAMP SHIVERED
THE BEST WAY IN MY OPINION WOULD BE TO----THE PLAN FOR----IN ONE OF THE----ROOMS----CHIMNEY I THINK I UNDERSTAND I SAID SLOWLY
SHE HAD SEEN THE GHOST SHE PERSISTED AND SHE WASN'T GOING INTO THE HALL
HE USED A STRANGE MEDLEY IN WHICH FAMILIAR WORDS TOOK UNFAMILIAR MEANINGS BUT IT WAS GRADUALLY MADE CLEAR TO US
BUT WHY SHOULD ARNOLD ARMSTRONG CARRY THAT AROUND UNLESS IT MEANT SOMETHING
IT ISN'T AN INNES TRAIT
IT WAS ALMOST MIDNIGHT
I PICKED UP THE MORNING PAPERS WHICH WERE STILL FULL OF THE LOOTING OF THE TRADERS BANK THE INTEREST AT FEVER HEIGHT AGAIN ON ACCOUNT OF PAUL ARMSTRONG'S DEATH
WE COULD GO AWAY HE WAS SAYING
BUT DOCTOR WALKER WENT OUT LATE LAST NIGHT TO A SERIOUS CASE IN SUMMITVILLE AND IS STILL THERE
HALSEY MUST NOT TELL THE DETECTIVE WHAT HE SUSPECTED UNTIL THE MONEY HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CHIMNEY-ROOM
IN FACT IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED AFTERWARD I AM PRETTY CERTAIN WE WERE UNDER SURVEILLANCE DURING THE ENTIRE GHOSTLY EVENING
I UNDERSTOOD ALSO THAT LEGAL STEPS WERE BEING TAKEN TO TERMINATE MY LEASE AT SUNNYSIDE
I LIKED THE LITTLE MAN
HE SAID A BREAK IN THE PLASTER MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED MONTHS AGO AND GONE UNNOTICED AND THAT THE DUST HAD PROBABLY BEEN STIRRED UP THE DAY BEFORE
WITH EVERY STEP MY KNEES SEEMED TO GIVE WAY UNDER ME
MRS FITZHUGH I SAID
I WAS INWARDLY ELATED TO THINK OF THE SURPRISE I WAS GOING TO GIVE THEM THAT NIGHT
ON TUESDAY THEN I SENT FOR THE CAR AND PREPARED TO GO OUT
IF I KNEW THAT ARNOLD ARMSTRONG HAD SPENT SOME TIME IN THE LODGE THE NIGHT BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED I WAS NO NEARER THE SOLUTION OF THE CRIME
I GOT UP AS FAR AS THE THIRD OR FOURTH STEP
SOME ONE WAS LURKING ON THE STAIRCASE WHEN I WENT BACK
SHE SAID IT FINALLY WHEN SHE HAD BADE A CONSTRAINED GOOD-BY TO HALSEY AND THE CAR WAS WAITING AT THE DOOR
AND WHAT'S YOUR MOTHER'S NAME MOTHER OF COURSE
ELIZA SAID THAT FROM THE HOLE IN THE WALL A BURNING EYE LOOKED DOWN AT HER THE WALL MUST BE AT LEAST SIX INCHES THICK I SAID WITH ASPERITY
I HAD A BLISTER ON MY PALM WHEN AT LAST THE HATCHET WENT THROUGH AND FELL WITH WHAT SOUNDED LIKE THE REPORT OF A GUN TO MY OVERSTRAINED NERVES
MR JAMIESON CAME UP TO ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE CORONER'S OFFICE
THAT I DID NOT KNOW WHO THE MURDERED MAN WAS UNTIL MR JARVIS FROM THE CLUB INFORMED ME AND THAT I KNEW OF NO REASON WHY MR ARNOLD ARMSTRONG SHOULD STEAL INTO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AT NIGHT
SO THAT UNLESS A THIEF WAS AS BLIND AS--AS SOME DETECTIVES HE COULD WALK RIGHT IN LIDDY I SAID SHARPLY COME DOWN WITH US AND TURN ON ALL THE LIGHTS SHE OFFERED HER RESIGNATION AS USUAL ON THE SPOT BUT I TOOK HER BY THE ARM AND SHE CAME ALONG FINALLY
SHE WAS VERY WEAK AND SHE ONLY OPENED HER EYES AND LOOKED AT ME WHEN I SAT DOWN BESIDE HER
IT HAS COLLIDED WITH A FREIGHT CAR ON THE SIDING ABOVE THE STATION
THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL YOU SAY DOCTOR HE ASKED
ELEMENT
AS I LOOKED IT DARTED ACROSS THE VERANDA AND OUT OF SIGHT IN THE DARKNESS
THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PLANTS THAT'S VERY STRANGE I SAID THINKING HARD
WHEN THE MESSAGE CAME TO COME UP FOR TWO GIRLS AND THEIR TRUNKS I SUPPOSED THERE WAS SOMETHING DOING AND AS THIS HERE WOMAN HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR WORK IN THE VILLAGE I THOUGHT I'D BRING HER ALONG ALREADY I HAD ACQUIRED THE TRUE SUBURBANITE ABILITY TO TAKE SERVANTS ON FAITH
BUT HERE AS IN EVERY DIRECTION I TURNED I WAS BAFFLED
IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET ANY PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS AROUND HERE BECAUSE EVERY ONE DOWN IN THE VILLAGE IS SURE HE SAW THE MURDERER EITHER BEFORE OR SINCE THE CRIME
BETWEEN THEM I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF STARLIGHT SHINING DOWN ON ROWS OF WHITE HEADSTONES AND AN OCCASIONAL MORE IMPOSING MONUMENT OR TOWERING SHAFT
HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE CITY THE FOLLOWING DAY AND ARRANGED WITH HALSEY AND ALEX TO GUARD THE HOUSE
I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME THE REVOLVER YOU PICKED UP IN THE TULIP BED SO HE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG
SHE LOOKED AT THE SPOON SHE STILL HELD--I WASN'T SO ANXIOUS ABOUT IT
NEITHER HE SAID
IT WAS A PRETTY LITTLE TOWN ON THE RIVER AND BACK ON THE HILL I COULD SEE THE MORTONS BIG COUNTRY HOUSE WHERE HALSEY AND GERTRUDE HAD BEEN STAYING UNTIL THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER
HER DAYLIGHT COURAGE AND SELF-IMPORTANCE AND HER SHUDDERING DELIGHT IN THE MYSTERY IRRITATED ME BEYOND WORDS
HE WAS ALL RIGHT THIS EVENING AT DINNER
FORCED INTO ACQUIESCENCE BY HER MOTHER'S APPEALS OVERWHELMED BY THE SITUATION THE GIRL CONSENTED AND FLED
MISS GERTRUDE HE SAID IF YOU AND MISS LOUISE WOULD ONLY TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW AND SURMISE ABOUT THIS BUSINESS I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO A GREAT MANY THINGS
ADDED TO THAT THE COOK AND LIDDY HAD A FLARE-UP OVER THE PROPER WAY TO MAKE BEEF-TEA FOR LOUISE AND OF COURSE THE COOK LEFT
I'M A MEMBER OF THE VOLUNTEER COMPANY
IT WAS A RELIEF WHEN MRS WATSON TAPPED AT THE DOOR AND BROUGHT ME SOME TEA AND TOAST
GERTRUDE'S STORY WAS TRUE AS FAR AS IT WENT BUT SHE DIDN'T TELL EVERYTHING
THAT A HOUSEFUL OF DETECTIVES MISSED IT ENTIRELY WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE BUSY TRYING TO PROVE THAT TWO AND TWO MAKE FOUR
THE CARRINGTON WOMAN KNEW SOMETHING
I WISHED TO SEE YOU ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE HE SAID
IF MY SUSPICIONS--FOR I HAD SUSPICIONS--WERE TRUE I WOULD MAKE MY OWN INVESTIGATIONS AND MR JAMIESON SHOULD LEARN ONLY WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIM TO KNOW
COME IN THOMAS JOHNSON STOOD IN THE DOORWAY
ALTOGETHER IT WAS A GLOOMY AFFAIR AND THE SIX MEN IN THE CORNER WHO CONSTITUTED THE CORONER'S JURY WERE EVIDENTLY THE MEREST PUPPETS IN THE HANDS OF THAT ALL-POWERFUL GENTLEMAN THE CORONER
BUT--I CAN'T FOR A DAY OR SO ANYHOW
DO YOU KNOW MISS INNES HE SAID THE DEEPER I GO INTO THIS THING THE MORE STRANGE IT SEEMS TO ME
THERE IS NO MENTION OF SUCH A LINK AS YOU DESCRIBE AND YET IF YOUR THEORY IS RIGHT MR ARMSTRONG MUST HAVE TAKEN BACK IN HIS CUFFS ONE COMPLETE CUFF-LINK AND A HALF PERHAPS OF THE OTHER THE IDEA WAS NEW TO ME
THERE WAS SOMETHING GRISLY AND HORRIBLE TO ME SEEING HER THERE IN ALMOST THE SAME ATTITUDE AND IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE WE HAD FOUND HER BROTHER'S BODY
BUT I KNOW IT WARN'T MR ARNOLD
IT IS A GENERAL DEPARTMENT STORE HE WAS SILENT AFTER THAT BUT HE WENT TO THE TELEPHONE AS SOON AS WE GOT HOME AND CALLED UP KING AND COMPANY IN THE CITY
IN THE AFTERNOON HE DISAPPEARED AND IT WAS LATE THAT NIGHT WHEN HE CAME HOME
THEN--I THINK HE HAD A REVOLVER BUT I AM NOT SURE--HE STEPPED ASIDE AND THREW THE DOOR OPEN
HE WAS INSIDE BEFORE SHE HAD GOT BACK TO THE STAIRS
AS THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND ME I HALF REGRETTED MY IMPULSE
THAT AFTERNOON WE GERTRUDE HALSEY AND I ATTENDED THE CORONER'S INQUEST IN TOWN
HALSEY WATCHED AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND A COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF BOLTS ON THE OTHER DOORS SEEMED TO BE EFFECTUAL
WHY SHE HAD RUN AWAY NO ONE COULD IMAGINE
TO PERFECT THE PROFESSION OF MOTHERHOOD REQUIRES PRECISELY AS MANY YEARS AS THE CHILD HAS LIVED LIKE THE MAN WHO STARTED TO CARRY THE CALF AND ENDED BY WALKING ALONG WITH THE BULL ON HIS SHOULDERS
SHE HEARD A SOUND AS SHE WENT DOWN THE CORRIDOR LIKE SOME ONE MOVING FURNITURE BUT SHE WAS NOT NERVOUS
HE WAS PLAINLY DISGUSTED AND HE STEERED THE LIVERY HORSE AS HE WOULD THE DRAGON FLY FEELING UNEASILY WITH HIS LEFT FOOT FOR THE CLUTCH AND WORKING HIS RIGHT ELBOW AT AN IMAGINARY HORN EVERY TIME A DOG GOT IN THE WAY
MRS TATE THE BABY-CARRIAGE IN THE PATH THE CHILDREN AT THE SWING--ALL WERE THE SAME
IN SPITE OF MY ASSUMPTION OF INDIFFERENCE I LOCKED THE DOOR INTO THE HALL AND FINDING THE TRANSOM DID NOT CATCH I PUT A CHAIR CAUTIOUSLY BEFORE THE DOOR--IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO ROUSE LIDDY--AND CLIMBING UP PUT ON THE LEDGE OF THE TRANSOM A SMALL DRESSING-MIRROR SO THAT ANY MOVEMENT OF THE FRAME WOULD SEND IT CRASHING DOWN
I AM GOING TO STOP WEARING BLACK
ALSO HE HAD CALLED MR JAMIESON BY TELEPHONE AND SOMEWHAT GUARDEDLY HAD TOLD HIM OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S EVENTS
SOMETIMES WHEN I AM BORED I RING FOR LIDDY AND WE TALK THINGS OVER
JUST AFTER LUNCHEON BURKE THE BUTLER WAS TAKEN UNEXPECTEDLY WITH A PAIN IN HIS RIGHT SIDE MUCH WORSE WHEN I WAS WITHIN HEARING DISTANCE AND BY AFTERNOON HE WAS STARTED CITYWARD
HE CARRIED SOMETHING OVER HIS SHOULDER WHICH I COULD NOT MAKE OUT
I WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER ON ONE THING
SHE HAD MADE A PLUCKY FIGHT POOR CHILD
OTHERWISE HE WAS VERY GOOD TO LOOK AT STALWART AND TANNED WITH THE DIRECT GAZE THAT I LIKE
I FIRED AGAIN AND SOMETHING THAT WAS GLASS OR CHINA CRASHED TO THE GROUND
AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT I BROUGHT OUT THE PEARL CUFF-LINK
IT BEGAN TO YIELD SOMEWHERE FOR A THIN WEDGE OF YELLOWISH LIGHT WAS REFLECTED ON THE OPPOSITE WALL
ON THE VERY TOP SHE REPLIED
WAS IT ON THE MISSION LOUISE HAD MENTIONED
HE CAME BACK
LIDDY OR NO LIDDY I SHALL ADVERTISE TO-MORROW FOR A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY AND I DON'T CARE IF IT HAS A CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
BUT IF ANYTHING IS GOING TO OCCUR DON'T DARE TO LET ME MISS IT SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID
IT MAY HAVE BEEN WARNER AND ALEX WARNER IS IN THE KITCHEN MISS LIDDY SAID WITH DIGNITY
I WATCHED GERTRUDE CLOSELY AND SOMEWHAT SADLY
TRUNKS WERE HEAPED HERE AND THERE READY FOR THE TRUNK-ROOM AND THROUGH AN END WINDOW OF STAINED GLASS CAME A STREAK OF RED AND YELLOW DAYLIGHT THAT WAS EMINENTLY CHEERFUL
WHATEVER PAUL ARMSTRONG HAD BEEN HE HAD BEEN LAVISH WITH HIS STEPDAUGHTER
THEN THE GOOD DOCTOR COMES ACROSS ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WHO WAS A GRACELESS SCAMP--DE MORTUIS--WHAT'S THE REST OF IT?--AND HE IS QUARRELING WITH A LADY IN BLACK
I'D DONE SOME THINGS FOR THE DOCTOR BEFORE THAT WOULDN'T JUST BEAR LOOKING INTO BUT I TURNED A BIT SQUEAMISH DID YOU HELP WITH THAT I ASKED LEANING FORWARD
THAT IS--UNLESS--YOU DIDN'T SEE ANY ONE CROSSING THE LAWN OR SKULKING AROUND THE HOUSE DID YOU I THINK WE HAVE MYSTERY ON THE BRAIN GERTRUDE SAID WEARILY
THE FAILURE HAD HIT SMALL STOCK-HOLDERS VERY HARD THE MINISTER OF THE LITTLE METHODIST CHAPEL IN CASANOVA AMONG THEM
RIGHT AS CAN BE WITH FORCED CHEERFULNESS
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU I POINTED TO THE DOOR AND SHE UNDERSTOOD
LEANING ON THE PARAPET OF THE BRIDGE IN THE MOONLIGHT AND SMOKING A PIPE WAS ALEX THE GARDENER
A NEW CLUE TO WORK ON
THE TRADERS BANK HAD SUSPENDED PAYMENT AND JOHN BAILEY WAS UNDER ARREST CHARGED WITH WRECKING IT
SHE WAS JES NATCHALLY SKEERED
THERE WERE LIGHTS THERE STREAMING CHEERFULLY OUT ON TO THE TREES AND FROM AN UPPER ROOM CAME WAVERING SHADOWS AS IF SOME ONE WITH A LAMP WAS MOVING AROUND
I DECLARE LIDDY SHE SAID YOU ARE A BUNDLE OF NERVES
HALSEY PUT HER DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND BEGAN TO RUB HER COLD HANDS WHILE GERTRUDE AND LIDDY RAN FOR STIMULANTS
LOUISE ARRIVED AT SUNNYSIDE AND FOUND THE HOUSE RENTED
HE SAYS HE HAD A PAIR OF CUFF-LINKS ALSO BUT HE SOLD THEM FER A DOLLAR'N HALF PUT IN THE DISREPUTABLE INDIVIDUAL HOARSELY WITH AN EYE ON THE DETECTIVE
I RECKON YOU BETTAH COME IN MIS INNES HE SAID SPEAKING CAUTIOUSLY
THEY INTRODUCED THEMSELVES AS THE CORONER OF THE COUNTY AND TWO DETECTIVES FROM THE CITY
AS HE FELL SOMEBODY IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM SCREAMED AND RAN
HE ASKED FOR ONE ASSISTANT AND I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO GET OFF SO EASILY
OF THE MORE SERIOUS PART OF THE NIGHT'S EXPERIENCE OF COURSE WE SAID NOTHING
THERE WAS THE CRASH OF A FALLING BODY THE SLAM OF THE OUTER DOOR AND FOR AN INSTANT QUIET
THE THING THAT IS FUNNY TO ME IS THAT YOU INSIST ON REMAINING HERE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
ADVICE TO MAIDS AND MATRONS BY BEATRICE FAIRFAX AND THEN I SAW MYSELF
SHE WAS STARING WITH SAD EYES AT THE CHERUB PAINTED ON THE CEILING OVER THE BED AND BECAUSE SHE LOOKED TIRED I DID NOT DISTURB HER
WHEN MISTAH ARMSTRONG AND THE FAM'LY WENT AWAY MIS WATSON AN ME WE WAS LEF IN CHARGE TILL THE PLACE WAS RENTED
I GOT IN AND WE WENT SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY UP TO THE HOUSE
AT THE SECOND THAT IT GAVE OPENING AGAINST THE WALL WITH A CRASH AND EVIDENTLY TUMBLING SOMEBODY INTO THE ROOM THE STEALTHY FINGERS BEYOND THE MANTEL-DOOR GAVE THE KNOB THE PROPER IMPETUS AND--THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN AND CLOSED AGAIN
SHE SHRANK BACK A LITTLE BUT I SAID NOTHING
IN A MOMENT I WAS ON MY KNEES BESIDE HER HER ARM AROUND MY NECK HER CHEEK AGAINST MY HAIR
ANYHOW WHOEVER IT WAS THAT NIGHT LEFT THIS LITTLE SOUVENIR GERTRUDE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE CUFF-LINK AND WENT AS WHITE AS THE PEARLS IN IT
I WAS AFRAID HE WAS ILL BECAUSE--HE WAS TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING FOR ME AND HE HAD NOT COME BACK
JUST A DAY OR SO BEFORE THEY CAME HOME WITH THE BODY I GOT ANOTHER LETTER TELLING ME TO WATCH FOR A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN PITTED WITH SMALLPOX
AS FOR ME I SAT THERE AT THE FOOT OF THAT GHOSTLY STAIRCASE--SAT BECAUSE MY KNEES WOULDN'T HOLD ME--AND WONDERED WHERE IT WOULD ALL END
IT WAS SHE WARNER HAD HEARD IN THE LIBRARY
THE GHOST IS NOT LAID
SOME ONE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE HOUSE EVIDENTLY
MR ARMSTRONG HAD BEEN PLAYING CARDS
YOU BOY DOWN THERE I CALLED
ONE WAS A SMALL FLAT KEY WITH A RED CORD TIED TO IT AND THE OTHER WAS A BIT OF WHITE PAPER ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN SOMETHING IN THOMAS CRAMPED HAND
THE GIRL WAS IN TROUBLE ENOUGH AS IT WAS
IT WAS THE UNMISTAKABLE RUMBLE OF THE CASANOVA HACK
YOU MUST TAKE US ON FAITH HE SAID
I DON'T REMEMBER HOW WE GOT DOWN THE STAIRS
THINGS ARE BAD ENOUGH MR JAMIESON WITHOUT INVENTING BAD FEELING WHERE IT DOESN'T EXIST
JUST AT THE CORNER I RAN FULL TILT INTO SOMEBODY WHO SEEMED TO BE AS MUCH ALARMED AS I WAS
I PUT MY HAND ON THE SICK GIRL'S FOREHEAD
I COULD SEE THE CAR PLAINLY NOW AND WARNER WAS AT THE WHEEL--WARNER IN AN ULSTER AND A PAIR OF SLIPPERS OVER HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT
I GROPED FOR THE CHAIR FROM THE TABLE AND POUNDED WITH IT FRANTICALLY ON THE FLOOR
SHE PICKED IT UP AND TURNING RAN PART WAY DOWN THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
IT WAS SHE WHO HAD TAKEN CHARGE OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG'S FUNERAL HOWEVER AND I WENT AT ONCE TO THE TELEPHONE
I DIDN'T GET A LOOK AT THEIR FACES BUT I KNOW EVERY CHICK AND CHILD IN THE PLACE AND EVERYBODY KNOWS ME
BESIDE THAT MR ARNOLD WAS PLAYIN CARDS WHEN I GOT TO THE CLUB-HOUSE SAME'S HE'D BEEN DOIN ALL DAY AND THE NEXT MORNING YOU CAME BACK ALONG THE PATH PURSUED MR JAMIESON RELENTLESSLY
I COULD HAVE THROTTLED LIDDY FOR HER CARELESSNESS IN READING THE TORN NOTE WHERE HE COULD HEAR
SHE HAD SENT FOR ME TO ASK ME IF I WOULD TRY TO INTEREST THE ARMSTRONGS IN THE CHILD
THE POLICE THINK HE WAS ADMITTED FROM WITHIN AND THAT HE WAS SHOT DOWN FROM ABOVE BY SOMEONE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE I KNOW NOTHING OF IT HE MAINTAINED
WHAT WAS THAT YOU SAID TO ME MISS INNES ABOUT THE MURDER AT THE HOUSE BEING A BEGINNING AND NOT AN END
HE RAN AGAINST THE HAMPER AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS CAUGHT HIS CUFF-LINK IN IT AND DROPPED THE GOLF-STICK WITH A CRASH
DID YOU NOTICE ON THE SIX-O'CLOCK TRAIN ANY PERSON--ANY MAN--WHO LIMPED A LITTLE I ASKED
NO'M HE SAID HUSKILY
BUT ONE THING I MIGHT HAVE TOLD YOU A LONG TIME AGO
I HAD NO TOOLS BUT AFTER RUMMAGING AROUND I FOUND A PAIR OF GARDEN SCISSORS AND A HATCHET AND THUS ARMED I SET TO WORK
HE KEPT A CAREFUL EYE ON ME HOWEVER AND SLID INTO A CHAIR BY THE DOOR WHEN HE WAS ASKED TO SIT DOWN
THERE WAS NO ONE WITH MR ARMSTRONG WHEN HE ENTERED IT WAS PERFECTLY DARK
HALSEY BRING SOME WHISKY AND WE WILL ALL GO DOWN NO ONE MOVED TO GET THE WHISKY FROM WHICH I JUDGED THERE WERE THREE POCKET FLASKS READY FOR EMERGENCY
THE BASKET HAD BEEN OVERTURNED BUT THAT WAS ALL
LIDDY WHO WAS BORN AND BRED ON A BRICK PAVEMENT GOT A LITTLE BIT DOWN-SPIRITED WHEN THE CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP OR SCRAPE THEIR LEGS TOGETHER OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY DO AT TWILIGHT
I--WAS--THERE GERTRUDE I SAID EXCITEDLY YOU ARE DREAMING
EIGHT FEET IN ONE DIRECTION AND ALMOST SEVEN IN THE OTHER--WHAT A CHIMNEY IT WAS
BUT WHEN HIS OFFICE BOY HAD GIVEN WAY TO HIS CONFIDENTIAL CLERK AND THAT FUNCTIONARY HAD CONDESCENDED TO CONNECT HIS EMPLOYER'S DESK TELEPHONE I WAS SOMEWHAT AT A LOSS AS TO HOW TO BEGIN
LIDDY SQUEALED AND DREW ME BACK AGAIN AND AS THE DOOR SLAMMED THE MIRROR I HAD PUT ON THE TRANSOM CAME DOWN AND HIT HER ON THE HEAD
THE NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN SO GARBLED AND INCOMPLETE--ONE OF THEM MENTIONED ME BUT ONCE AND THEN ONLY AS THE TENANT AT THE TIME THE THING HAPPENED--THAT I FEEL IT MY DUE TO TELL WHAT I KNOW
THE PEOPLE WERE GERMANS AND HE CALLED THE FARMER'S WIFE GROSSMUTTER
IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE TO SEE THE CURVING ROW OF PARALLEL LIGHTS THAT MARKED THE CARRIAGE ROAD
THERE COULD BE MOTIVE PROVED I THINK
MR JAMIESON THEY SAID HAD ARRANGED FOR MORE TO ASSIST IN THE SEARCH FOR THE MISSING MAN AND AT THAT TIME THE COUNTRY WAS BEING SCOURED IN ALL DIRECTIONS
TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES AND THEN A SOUND
ROSIE IS A PRETTY YOUNG GIRL AND PERHAPS SHE HAS A SWEETHEART
BAILEY AND ARMSTRONG HAD QUARRELED AT THE CLUB
GIRL AND WOMAN SHE SAID I'VE BEEN WITH YOU TWENTY-FIVE YEARS MISS RACHEL THROUGH GOOD TEMPER AND BAD THE IDEA
SO WITH A SUDDEN RESOLUTION I OPENED THE DOOR AGAIN AND STEPPED OUT INTO THE DARKNESS
I HAD TIME TO GET A HAZY VIEW OF A SMALL PORTABLE SAFE A COMMON WOODEN TABLE AND A CHAIR--THEN THE MANTEL DOOR SWUNG TO AND CLICKED BEHIND ME
HE KNEW AND GERTRUDE TOO WHY JACK BAILEY AND HE HAD GONE AWAY THAT NIGHT AS THEY DID
HE LEFT--IT WAS A QUARTER TO THREE
SHE MUST HAVE EXAMINED IT ANYHOW THAT NIGHT
YOUNG WALKER DOWN IN CASANOVA HAS BEEN ATTENDING THEM
NOW RIGGS BEGAN MR JAMIESON KINDLY
THE MILK-BOY WAS POUNDING SOMEWHERE BELOW AND THE DAY HAD BEGUN
HE DID--HE ABSOLUTELY DISAPPEARED IN THE DUSK WITHOUT MY GETTING MORE THAN A GLIMPSE OF HIS FACE
HE STOPPED AT THE CLUB ON HIS WAY OVER I--DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS I SAID FEEBLY
SHE SWITCHED ON ALL THE LIGHTS AND POINTED TO A DOOR JUST AHEAD
THE SAME HORRIBLE THOUGHT KEEPS RECURRING TO ME I WHISPERED
JUST NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS I SEE YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED AN IOTA IN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY RACHEL THIS WAS INTENDED TO BE ANOTHER JEST
THE EAST VERANDA WAS SHADY GREEN WITH VINES AND PALMS CHEERFUL WITH CUSHIONS AND LOUNGING CHAIRS
I TRIED TO THINK THAT SHE HAD HEARD THE RAPPING NOISES BEFORE I DID AND GONE TO INVESTIGATE BUT I'M AFRAID I WAS A MORAL COWARD THAT DAY
CLOCKS HAVE TO STOP DON'T THEY IF THEY'RE NOT WOUND IT'S WOUND UP ALL RIGHT AND IT STOPPED AT THREE O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT HE ANSWERED SOLEMNLY
I KNEW LIDDY WOULD WANT MY HELIOTROPE POPLIN AND SHE'S A FRIGHT IN LAVENDER
IT WAS A SUPREME DISAPPOINTMENT
I TRIED TO RETAIN MY CONSCIOUSNESS BY WALKING THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM AND BACK OVER AND OVER BUT I HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO KEEP IT UP SO I SAT DOWN ON THE TABLE AGAIN MY BACK AGAINST THE WALL
THE CREEK IS SHALLOW NOW
THEN WE ARE JUST WHERE WE STARTED NOT SO BAD AS THAT MISS INNES RIGGS SAID EAGERLY
THE BIRDS--DON'T ASK ME WHAT KIND
GET UP
WHO WAS LUCIEN WALLACE
HE WUZ STANDIN WITH HIS BACK TO ME AN HE WAS WORKIN WITH ONE OF THESE YERE ELECTRIC LIGHT THINGS THAT FIT IN YER POCKET
THE FREQUENT INVASIONS OF THE HOUSE HAD EFFECTUALLY PREVENTED ANY RELAXATION AFTER DUSK
FINALLY HOWEVER SHE REALIZED THAT HER ONLY TRAINING HAD BEEN DOMESTIC AND SHE PUT THE BOY IN AN EPISCOPALIAN HOME AND SECURED THE POSITION OF HOUSEKEEPER TO THE ARMSTRONGS
MISS INNES SHE SAID HAS MY STEPBROTHER ARNOLD GONE AWAY WHAT DO YOU MEAN I ASKED STARTLED
BUT PRESENTLY SOMETHING OCCURRED THAT MADE ME THINK THAT UNDER GERTRUDE'S SURFACE CALM THERE WAS A SEETHING FLOOD OF EMOTIONS
WHERE WAS YOUR NEPHEW I WAS ENTIRELY DESPERATE BY THAT TIME
I BELIEVE THE MORAL DEDUCED BY THE VILLAGE WAS THAT IT IS ALWAYS UNLUCKY TO THROW A STONE AT A BLACK CAT
I THOUGHT PERHAPS SHE WAS A FRIEND OF YOURS BUT OF COURSE I DIDN'T ASK SHE WAS NOT--POCK-MARKED I ASKED AT A VENTURE
AS I LOOK BACK SO MANY THINGS ARE PLAIN TO ME THAT I WONDER I COULD NOT SEE AT THE TIME
IT WAS CLOSED AND LOCKED AGAIN AND MY FINGERS IN THE DARKNESS SLID OVER A SMOOTH WOODEN SURFACE WITHOUT A SIGN OF A KNOB
YOU SAY IT WAS BURIED DEEP
IT WAS NATURAL OF COURSE THAT THE THING WOULD SHOCK HER HAVING BEEN THE ARMSTRONGS HOUSEKEEPER FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND KNOWING MR ARNOLD WELL
THE GREENWOOD CLUB SHOWED ITSELF A DAB OF WHITE AGAINST THE HILL ACROSS THE VALLEY AND AN EARLY ROBIN OR TWO HOPPED AROUND IN THE DEW
IT WAS SHE WHO HAD CREPT DOWN THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE DRAWN BY A MAGNET THAT NIGHT MR JAMIESON HAD HEARD SOME ONE THERE
I PICKED IT UP BUT MY HAND SHOOK SO THAT I PUT IT DOWN AGAIN AND GOT SOMEHOW TO THE DOOR
BUT BEFORE I GO MISS INNES I WISH YOU WOULD BE MORE FRANK WITH ME THAN YOU HAVE BEEN YET
I FEEL THAT I AM ENTITLED TO SOME KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE I AND MY FAMILY ARE JUST NOW IN A MOST AMBIGUOUS POSITION I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE UNDERSTOOD ME OR NOT
THE COUNTRYSIDE LAY SUNNY AND QUIET IN ITS PEACEFUL SUNDAY AFTERNOON CALM AND FAR DOWN THE DRIVE MR JAMIESON WAS WALKING SLOWLY STOOPING NOW AND THEN AS IF TO EXAMINE THE ROAD
YOU ARE THE VERY WOMAN I WANT TO SEE HE SAID PROMPTLY
BUT I WAS AFRAID I WAS TOO WEAK TO GET DOWN THE STAIRS
IT'S A MERCY IT DIDN'T FALL OUT ON THE WAY WHEN LIDDY HAD GONE I EXAMINED THE FRAGMENT ATTENTIVELY
HIS HONEST BOYISH FACE WAS COLORLESS
AS BEFORE HALSEY WATCHED THE EAST ENTRY FROM TEN UNTIL TWO
THE DOCTOR WAS ACTIVE MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY
REAL EGGS REAL MILK AND A TOUCH OF REAL KENTUCKY WHISKY HE SAID
I FELT THAT THEY WERE DOING ME HONOR IN MAKING ME ONE OF THE PARTY AND I WOULD SHOW THEM I COULD BE AS SILENT AS THEY
BUT WHEN AT LAST WE HAD LEFT THE FAMILY ON THE PORCH AND THE GOOD DOCTOR WAS UNTYING OUR STEED I ASKED HIM THE SAME QUESTION I HAD PUT TO DOCTOR WALKER
A CRASH IN THE NIGHT
YOU ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THIS KIND OF THING I DON'T THINK SHE EVEN HEARD ME
THE STEWARD GAVE IT TO ARNOLD WHO HAD BEEN DRINKING ALL DAY AND COULDN'T SLEEP AND WAS GOING FOR A STROLL IN THE DIRECTION OF SUNNYSIDE AND HE BROUGHT IT YES WHAT WAS IN THE TELEGRAM I CAN TELL YOU--AS SOON AS CERTAIN THINGS ARE MADE PUBLIC
MIGHT IT NOT HAVE BEEN THE MYSTERIOUS INTRUDER AGAIN
SOMETHIN'S GOIN TO HAPPEN SURE
IT WAS EMPTY
THEY STEPPED INTO THE ROAD IN FRONT OF THE CAR TO STOP IT AND FATE PLAYED INTO THEIR HANDS
THE RESULT WAS ABSOLUTELY NIL
GRADUALLY I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT GERTRUDE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD BELIEVED HER LOVER GUILTY AND--ALTHOUGH I BELIEVED IT MYSELF FOR THAT MATTER--I WAS IRRITATED BY HER INDIFFERENCE
THE COOK BEGAN TO CRY AND MRS WATSON KNOCKED OVER A CHAIR
I WAS TAKING A BLANKET DOWN TO THOMAS WHO IS--NOT WELL TO-NIGHT AND I USED THIS STAIRCASE AS BEING NEARER THE PATH TO THE LODGE
SHE HAD OBJECTED TO ROSIE THE PARLOR MAID FROM THE START
THERE WAS--NO SIGN BUT SURELY--HE CAN'T BE--GONE I CRIED
THOMAS I SAID YOU HAVE BEEN SMOKING NO MA'M HE WAS INJURED INNOCENCE ITSELF
IF FOR INSTANCE THE INTRUDER WHO DROPPED THE BAR AND SCRATCHED THE STAIRCASE--YOU SEE I KNOW ABOUT THAT--IF THIS VISITOR WAS A WOMAN WHY SHOULD NOT THE SAME WOMAN HAVE COME BACK THE FOLLOWING NIGHT MET MR ARMSTRONG ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE AND IN ALARM SHOT HIM IT WAS A MAN I REITERATED
WAS GERTRUDE'S LOVER A VILLAIN OR A VICTIM
I WAS UP THERE MYSELF AT THE FIRE HE SAID VOLUBLY
THERE MUST CERTAINLY BE SOME EXPLANATION--BUT WHAT WAS IT
SHE IS GOING TO BED EARLY AFTER LIDDY HAD GONE I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT THE MEN AT THE STABLE AND I GREW MORE AND MORE ANXIOUS
IT WAS FOUR BEFORE LOUISE WAS ABLE TO TALK AND THE FIRST RAYS OF DAWN WERE COMING THROUGH HER WINDOWS WHICH FACED THE EAST BEFORE SHE COULD TELL US COHERENTLY WHAT HAD OCCURRED
AND--AND LOUISE IS NOT IN HER ROOM WITH A JERK HALSEY TOOK THE LIGHT FROM LIDDY AND RAN DOWN THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
HE WAITED HOWEVER UNTIL THOMAS LEFT THE DINING-ROOM
WHO WAS IT OUR STRICKEN FACES TOLD HIM THE TRUTH
NEVERTHELESS MY OPINION REMAINED UNCHANGED
THE LINES ARE CLOSING UP MISS INNES THE PAPER WAS THE ONE HE HAD FOUND AMONG ARNOLD ARMSTRONG'S EFFECTS AND I READ IT AGAIN
THEN I SHUT MY TEETH AND WENT ON
I'D BETTER START AT THE BEGINNING
SEND MR INNES UP HALSEY CAME UP THE STAIRS SLOWLY LOOKING RATHER INTERESTED AND INCLINED TO BE AMUSED
TIME HUNG HEAVY ON MY HANDS AND I DID AS I HAD FALLEN INTO A HABIT OF DOING LATELY--I SAT DOWN AND THOUGHT THINGS OVER
IT WAS EVIDENT HE HAD TOLD US ALL HE KNEW
THINGS WERE QUIET AT THE HOUSE AND THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OLD MAN'S DEATH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY KEPT FROM THE SERVANTS
THE BILLIARD AND CARD-ROOMS WERE LOCKED UNTIL THE CORONER AND THE DETECTIVES GOT THERE AND THE MEN FROM THE CLUB HAD GONE BACK FOR MORE CONVENTIONAL CLOTHING
HE WAS A COUNTRY BOY ABSOLUTELY FRANK AND RELIABLE OF FAIR EDUCATION AND INTELLIGENCE--ONE OF THE SMALL ARMY OF AMERICAN YOUTHS WHO TURN A NATURAL APTITUDE FOR MECHANICS INTO THE SPECIAL FIELD OF THE AUTOMOBILE AND EARN GOOD SALARIES IN A CONGENIAL OCCUPATION
THIS IS DUE TO YOUR CARELESSNESS I SAID
WELL MARY I SAID ENCOURAGINGLY WHAT'S THE MATTER
YOU SAY THERE HAVE BEEN INTRUDERS IN THE HOUSE HE ASKED
CHAPTER XXV A VISIT FROM LOUISE THAT DAY WAS DESTINED TO BE AN EVENTFUL ONE FOR WHEN I ENTERED THE HOUSE AND FOUND ELIZA ENSCONCED IN THE UPPER HALL ON A CHAIR WITH MARY ANNE DOING HER BEST TO STIFLE HER WITH HOUSEHOLD AMMONIA AND LIDDY RUBBING HER WRISTS--WHATEVER GOOD THAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO--I KNEW THAT THE GHOST HAD BEEN WALKING AGAIN AND THIS TIME IN DAYLIGHT
IT WAS PERFECTLY DARK OUTSIDE
THAT I WAS TO BE CAUGHT AND ALMOST FINISHED IN THE CLOSING WAS HAPPILY UNKNOWN TO US ALL
FOR SOME REASON I FELT I WAS BEING PUMPED AS HALSEY SAYS
IF YOU HAD KNOWN IT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUSPECTED ME FOR A MOMENT OF--OF HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ATTACK ON ARNOLD ARMSTRONG
C THE NEW COOK AND HER INITIALS TROUBLED ME NOT AT ALL
THE GIRL SEEMED TO SHRINK BACK AMONG HER PILLOWS AT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE
WAS LOUISE UNDER SURVEILLANCE
THAT WAS THE WAY THINGS STOOD THAT THURSDAY NIGHT WHEN I MYSELF TOOK A HAND IN THE STRUGGLE
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN
BUT WHY WAS HE THERE IF IT WERE INDEED HE
YOU WILL FIND IT ABOUT THIRTY MILES AWAY AT ANDREWS STATION IN A BLACKSMITH SHOP WHERE IT IS BEING REPAIRED I LAID DOWN MY KNITTING THEN AND LOOKED AT HIM
IT WAS LATE WHEN I LEFT--I WAS ON FOOT AND ABOUT A MILE FROM THE CLUB ON THE CLAYSBURG ROAD I MET TWO PEOPLE
WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF GROWING WORSE SHE HAD WRITTEN TO MRS ARMSTRONG TELLING HER NOTHING BUT THAT ARNOLD'S LEGITIMATE CHILD WAS AT RICHFIELD AND IMPLORING HER TO RECOGNIZE HIM
MR HARTON I AM GOING TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS AND I HOPE YOU WILL ANSWER THEM
THE GIRL HERSELF WAS TOO ILL TO NOTICE WHAT WAS BEING DONE
THEN WE TWO SIDE BY SIDE WENT DOWN THE DRIVE
TOO MANY THINGS HAD OCCURRED IN WHICH GERTRUDE WAS OR APPEARED TO BE INVOLVED TO ALLOW ANYTHING TO BE LEFT IN QUESTION
IT WAS THIS THAT HAD TAKEN HALSEY TO THE DOCTOR THE NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED
HAS THE MOTHER COME NO BUT SOME ONE CAME AND PAID THE BOY'S BOARD FOR A MONTH
SHE IS A VERY CRUEL AND UNGRATEFUL GIRL SHE IS A VERY SICK GIRL HE SAID GRAVELY
AND THEN FAR OFF I HEARD THE RAPPING NOISE THAT HAD LURED LOUISE DOWN THE STAIRCASE THAT OTHER NIGHT TWO WEEKS BEFORE
THE BLUE-PRINTS OF SUNNYSIDE HE SAID
THE SHOT FIRED YOUR NEPHEW AND BAILEY LEFT THE HOUSE AT ONCE GOING TOWARD THE AUTOMOBILE HOUSE
THEN--THE OPPOSITE WALL SWUNG OPEN NOISELESSLY CLOSED AGAIN WITHOUT A SOUND AND I WAS ALONE
IT WAS HALSEY'S REVOLVER
THE MYSTERY SEEMED TO DEEPEN CONSTANTLY
THEN ONE DAY MIS WATSON SHE CAME TO ME AN SHE SEZ SEZ SHE THOMAS YOU'LL HEV TO SLEEP UP IN THE BIG HOUSE
WHERE IS HALSEY SHE DEMANDED
WELL YOUNG MAN YOU DON'T SEEM TO KNOW MUCH ABOUT YOURSELF I'VE TRIED IT ALL WEEK MRS TATE BROKE IN
SHE'S DYING AUNT RAY HE SAID HUSKILY
THEN I KNEW
DINNER OVER I WENT INTO THE LIVING-ROOM
THOMAS SENT FOR MRS WATSON AND THEN WENT FOR ARNOLD ARMSTRONG AT THE GREENWOOD CLUB
WHY YOU AND LIDDY NEED ME TO ARBITRATE BETWEEN YOU EVERY DAY IN THE WEEK PERHAPS I WAS GROWING SUSPICIOUS OF EVERY ONE BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT GERTRUDE'S GAIETY WAS FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL
FOR AS MANY SUMMERS I HAD SAID GOOD-BY TO MY FRIENDS AND AFTER WATCHING THEIR PERSPIRING HEGIRA HAD SETTLED DOWN TO A DELICIOUS QUIET IN TOWN WHERE THE MAIL COMES THREE TIMES A DAY AND THE WATER SUPPLY DOES NOT DEPEND ON A TANK ON THE ROOF
I HAD A VAGUE IMPRESSION OF UNFAMILIAR FEATURES AND OF A SORT OF CAP WITH A VISOR
LIDDY WAS IN MY DRESSING-ROOM SUSPICIOUSLY RED-EYED AND TRYING TO PUT A RIGHT SLEEVE IN A LEFT ARMHOLE OF A NEW WAIST FOR ME
WHY DID BOTH SHE AND DOCTOR WALKER WARN US AWAY FROM THE HOUSE
MISS GERTRUDE ONLY BROUGHT FORWARD HER EXPLANATION THE FOLLOWING MORNING
THE WHOLE SITUATION WAS TERRIBLE
THIS WAS NOTHING LESS THAN THE LOOTING OF THE BANK'S SECURITIES TURNING THEM INTO MONEY AND MAKING HIS ESCAPE
AND YOU HELPED HIM BOTH OF YOU TO GET AWAY
WHAT'S THE MATTER LIDDY I ASKED AT LAST
SINCE THEN I HAVE DEVELOPED MY POWERS OF OBSERVATION BUT AT THAT TIME I WAS A NOVICE
YOU'RE A SIGHT AND AT YOUR AGE SHE HAD A GOLF-STICK IN HER HAND AND SHE SAID SHE HAD FOUND IT ON THE LAWN
I HAD HEARD A CRASHING SOUND BUT BEING ALONE WITH ONE MAID HAD NOT INVESTIGATED
ONCE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM GERTRUDE COLLAPSED AND WENT FROM ONE FAINTING SPELL INTO ANOTHER
THE PUZZLE WAS NO CLEARER AT THE END OF THE HALF-HOUR
DID YOU WAIT TO SEE WHO IT WAS I WASN'T SPYING MISS INNES WARNER SAID WITH DIGNITY
GET UP WON'T YOU IT ISN'T OUR HOUSE HE SAID SLEEPILY
CARRIED OFF HE SAID WITH PRETENDED SURPRISE
DOESN'T IT LOOK RATHER AS THOUGH HE THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE GERTRUDE ROSE ANGRILY
GERTRUDE AND HALSEY WERE BOTH GLOOMY AND DISTRAUGHT AND AS LIDDY HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED THAT SOME OF THE CHINA WAS BROKEN--IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM AN OLD SERVANT--I WAS NOT IN A PLEASANT HUMOR MYSELF
HE HAD MADE A SEARCH FOR A WEAPON BUT THERE WAS NONE AROUND
BUT WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANY MONEY MISS INNES
HE CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN THE WHOLE AFFAIR
HE GREW LIVID AND A SMALL CROOKED BLOOD-VESSEL IN HIS TEMPLE SWELLED AND THROBBED CURIOUSLY
CHAPTER IX JUST LIKE A GIRL AUNT RAY HALSEY SAID FROM THE GLOOM BEHIND THE LAMPS
SHALL I SEND IT OUT BETTER OPEN IT AND READ IT TO ME I SUGGESTED
BEFORE THE THOUGHT HAD COME TO ME I HAD ALREADY SEEN A GLEAM OF LIGHT FROM THE TWO SMALL VENTILATING PIPES IN THE ROOF
SHE WAS ABOUT TO REPLY WHEN I SCOOPED UP THE PIECES AND LEFT THE CONSERVATORY
FINALLY WHEN LIDDY HAD DROPPED INTO A DOZE I EVEN VENTURED AS FAR AS THE HEAD OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE BUT THERE FLOATED UP TO ME ONLY THE EVEN BREATHING OF WINTERS THE NIGHT DETECTIVE SLEEPING JUST INSIDE THE ENTRY
WHAT NO GHOST NO DETECTIVES HE SAID STILL WITH HIS SMILE
SHE LAY LIMP AND WHITE HER DRESSING-GOWN DRAGGING LOOSE FROM ONE SLEEVE OF HER NIGHT-DRESS AND THE HEAVY BRAID OF HER DARK HAIR STRETCHING ITS LENGTH A COUPLE OF STEPS ABOVE HER HEAD AS IF SHE HAD SLIPPED DOWN
I HARDLY KNEW SHE WAS GONE UNTIL I HEARD THE STATION HACK MOVING OFF
I KNEW SHE WOULD NOT GO
SHE LEFT THE BIG HOUSE AND WENT DOWN TO THE LODGE
WHEN JAMIESON--WHEN MR JAMIESON CALLS UP WE CAN START HIM RIGHT
WHATEVER HE DID HE IS BEYOND THE LAW NOW GERTRUDE TURNED PALE
ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK MR JAMIESON TELEPHONED FROM THE CASANOVA STATION AND WARNER WENT DOWN TO MEET HIM
MR JAMIESON LOOKED UP AT ME
I AM SORRY TO DISTURB YOU HE SAID
BURNS IS BACK IN THE COUNTRY ON A CLUE WE GOT FROM THE NIGHT CLERK AT THE DRUG-STORE
THE NURSE GAVE HER A STIMULANT AND IN A LITTLE WHILE SHE WAS ABLE TO TALK
MRS ARMSTRONG HAD RETIRED AND HE SAID PERHAPS A DOZEN WORDS TO MISS LOUISE
THE SHOCK OF TWO DEATHS I SUPPOSE HAS DONE THIS HE REMARKED PICKING UP HIS CASE
I GAVE UP TRYING TO ELICIT ANY INFORMATION FROM HIM AND WE WENT TOGETHER TO VIEW THE BODY BEFORE IT WAS TAKEN TO THE CITY
THE SMALL DRIVER CAUGHT MY ATTENTION AT ONCE
THE SISTERS OF COURSE KNEW NOTHING OF THIS AND THE YOUNG MAN'S ARDOR RATHER CARRIED THEM AWAY
HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MONEY WAS GONE
ALTHOUGH LIDDY PERSISTED IN HER BELIEF THAT DOORS WOULD PROVE NO OBSTACLES TO OUR DISTURBERS
I TURNED AND FOLLOWED GERTRUDE SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE
THERE'S GOING TO BE A DEATH SHE WAILED
RANG THAT BELL SO HARD I HADN'T TIME SCARCELY TO GET EM ON AND--DID YOU SEE A MAN WHO LIMPED GERTRUDE PUT IN AS HE STOPPED FOR BREATH
THEN AS CLEARLY AS I COULD I RELATED HOW THE NIGHT BEFORE A SHOT HAD ROUSED US
I'M TOO NERVOUS TO DO IT ANY MORE BUT I JES RECKON TO MYSELF THAT EF IT'S TOO SKEERY FER HER IT'S TOO SKEERY FER ME
HE WAS FURIOUS OVER THE CHILD'S DISAPPEARANCE AND SHE WAS AFRAID HE WOULD DO HER SOME HURT
THE SECOND MRS ARMSTRONG HAD BEEN A WIDOW WITH A CHILD A LITTLE GIRL
BUT SHE WAS SO EXCITED I WAS AFRAID SHE WOULD DO AS SHE SAID--DRAG IT DOWN HERSELF AND SCRATCH THE STAIRCASE I WAS TRYING TO GET MY BONNET OFF AND TO KEEP THE MAIDS QUIET AT THE SAME TIME
IT WAS A MOMENT BEFORE HE LOCATED ME
AND--AFTER THAT MR JAMIESON WENT ON YOU WENT DIRECTLY TO BED GERTRUDE HESITATED
ONCE INDEED--BUT MR JAMIESON SAID IT WAS AN OWL AND I TRIED TO BELIEVE HIM
THEY DID NOT SEE OR HEAR ME AND I BEAT A HASTY RETREAT TO THE LIBRARY
BUT--I CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT LOUISE ARMSTRONG AUNT RAY
MR JAMIESON SHOOK IT BUT IT WAS A HEAVY DOOR WELL LOCKED
WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM THE TELEPHONE HIS FACE SHOWED THAT SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED
THE OPENING HAD BEEN MADE BETWEEN THE FLUE AND THE OUTER WALL OF THE HOUSE
CHAPTER XXXIII AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS AS I DROVE RAPIDLY UP TO THE HOUSE FROM CASANOVA STATION IN THE HACK I SAW THE DETECTIVE BURNS LOITERING ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE WALKER PLACE
IF I'D BEEN STILL SLEEPING FAINTING CORRECTED ROSIE I'D A BEEN HIT ON THE HEAD AND KILLED I WISHT YOU'D HEARD HER SCREAM PUT IN MARY ANNE
SOME TIME ABOUT NOON OF THAT DAY WEDNESDAY MRS OGDEN FITZHUGH TELEPHONED ME
I WENT TO BED AT DAYLIGHT AND THAT WAS THE LAST I HEARD OF HER UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN I SAW HER ON A TRUCK AT THE STATION COVERED WITH A SHEET
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT IMPULSE MOVED ME BUT I WENT IN AND TURNED THE KNOB
ON THE AFTERNOON BEFORE MONDAY WHILE THE TRADERS BANK WAS IN THE RUSH OF CLOSING HOUR BETWEEN TWO AND THREE MR JACOB TRAUTMAN PRESIDENT OF THE PEARL BREWING COMPANY CAME INTO THE BANK TO LIFT A LOAN
A NEW ELEMENT WAS ABOUT TO ENTER INTO AFFAIRS
YOU CAME HERE FRIDAY NIGHT TO SEE MISS INNES DIDN'T YOU
I CAN NOT STAND IT
BUT HE WAS NOT THROUGH
ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK GERTRUDE CAME IN
SHE SAID SHE WORKED IN A DEPARTMENT STORE AND COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF THE CHILD PROPERLY AND HE NEEDED FRESH AIR AND MILK
TAKE MY HORSE AND TRAP OUTSIDE AND DRIVE LIKE MAD
IN SOME WAY THE WOMAN HAD LEARNED OF THE SUBSTITUTION AND HAD TRIED TO USE HER KNOWLEDGE FOR BLACKMAIL
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE I KNEW
TWICE NOW WITHOUT APPARENT CAUSE SOME ONE HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE BY MEANS OF THE EAST ENTRANCE
YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE THIS MISERABLE HOUSE TO-NIGHT
TAKEN INTO THE BOSOM OF THE FAMILY AT ONCE FLINDERS TIED OUTSIDE AND NIBBLING THE GRASS AT THE ROADSIDE GERTRUDE AND I DRANK SOME HOME-MADE ELDERBERRY WINE AND TOLD BRIEFLY OF THE FIRE
I KNOW YOU PICKED UP SOMETHING IN THE FLOWER BED
SHE TOLD HIM OF THE BOY AND THREATENED EXPOSURE IF HE DID NOT PROVIDE FOR HIM
THOMAS OPENED THE DOOR HIMSELF--THOMAS FULLY DRESSED AND IN HIS CUSTOMARY HEALTH
SHE LOVES IT DEARLY AND JUST NOW SHE WISHES TO RETIRE HERE FOR QUIET AND PEACE SHE MUST HAVE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART I SAID UNGRACIOUSLY ENOUGH
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO REALIZE EIGHTY PER CENT
IF I COULD ONLY HAVE SEEN HALSEY COMING AT HIS USUAL HARE-BRAINED CLIP UP THE DRIVE IF I COULD HAVE HEARD THE THROB OF THE MOTOR I WOULD HAVE FELT THAT MY TROUBLES WERE OVER
AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE HUDDLED IN A HEAP HER HEAD ON THE LOWER STAIR WAS LOUISE ARMSTRONG
AFTER A TIME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN RIGHT
THE CHAIR WAS LOWER THAN HE EXPECTED AND HIS DIGNITY REQUIRED COLLECTING BEFORE HE WENT ON
THERE WAS SOMETHING BAFFLING IN THE GIRL'S EYES
HALSEY'S CLEAR HEAD AND GERTRUDE'S INTUITION MIGHT DO WHAT LIDDY'S HYSTERIA AND THREE DETECTIVES HAD FAILED IN
GERTRUDE AND HER INJURED ANKLE
YOU PROFESS TO KNOW THE TRUTH BUT YOU CAN NOT TELL ME
NOW SHE TURNED ON LIDDY PETTISHLY
THAT WAS ALL AND IT SEEMED LITTLE ENOUGH EXCEPT THAT I WAS POSITIVE THE MARKS HAD NOT BEEN THERE THE DAY BEFORE
WELL I ASKED DIDN'T YOUR YOUNG MAN ENJOY HIS MEAL SHE COULDN'T SPEAK
HE MUST HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO WORK ON IN TOWN OR HE WOULD HAVE RETURNED
IT STOOD AT THE EDGE OF THE TOP STEP ALMOST BARRING PASSAGE AND ON THE STEP BELOW IT WAS A LONG FRESH SCRATCH
WE'D BETTER GO BY THE DRIVE HE SAID
THE MAN KNEW THE DETECTIVE AND HE GAVE HIM A PIECE OF DIRTY PAPER ON WHICH WAS SCRAWLED THE WORDS--"HE'S AT CITY HOSPITAL JOHNSVILLE THE TRAMP WHO BROUGHT THE PAPER PRETENDED TO KNOW NOTHING EXCEPT THIS
HE HAD KNOWN THOMAS WELL AND HAD PROMISED TO OFFICIATE AT THE SERVICES IN THE RICKETY AFRICAN ZION CHURCH
SUNNYSIDE IS HER HOME
I HAD NO WAY OF FINDING OUT AND THE INQUEST WAS PROCEEDING
HE WAS ASKED TO OFFICIATE AT THE SIMPLE SERVICES WHEN THE DEAD BANKER'S BODY WAS INTERRED IN CASANOVA CHURCHYARD BUT THE GOOD MAN PROVIDENTIALLY TOOK COLD AND A SUBSTITUTE WAS CALLED IN
JACK IS--UNDER ARREST UNDER ARREST GERTRUDE SCREAMED AND TORE THE PAPER OUT OF HIS HAND
HALSEY GOT UP LEISURELY AND OPENED IT ADMITTING WARNER
AND WHEN IT DOES WE SHALL FIND LOUISE ARMSTRONG A VICTIM I HAD NOT NOTICED WHERE WE WERE GOING BUT NOW I SAW WE WERE BESIDE THE RAILROAD AND FROM A KNOT OF MEN STANDING BESIDE THE TRACK I DIVINED THAT IT WAS HERE THE CAR HAD BEEN FOUND
I HAVE DONE ALL I COULD AND THEN SHE TURNED AND WENT UP THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE MOVING SLOWLY AND WITH A CERTAIN DIGNITY
HERE WE WERE GUARDED DAY AND NIGHT BY PRIVATE DETECTIVES WITH AN EXTRA MAN TO WATCH THE GROUNDS AND YET WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE LIVED IN A JAPANESE PAPER HOUSE FOR ALL THE PROTECTION WE HAD
MY REVOLVER TRUDE HE EXCLAIMED
AND I HAVE A NEW PIECE OF INFORMATION HE LOOKED CAREFULLY AWAY FROM GERTRUDE
I DID NOT KNOW THAT SUNNYSIDE WAS RENTED
SIT DOWN CHILD
AND HALSEY I MANAGED TO SAY
I TRIED THE SMALL ENTRY DOOR THERE WHICH OPENED ON THE VERANDA AND EXAMINED THE WINDOWS
I HAVE BEEN THINKING HARD I CONCLUDED AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THE MAN AT THE HEAD OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE WAS DOCTOR WALKER
THEN I WENT CLOSE AND EXAMINED IT TO STOP WITH A SHUDDER
WIRE AT ONCE IF LOUISE IS WITH YOU YOU SEE MISS INNES LOUISE MUST HAVE STARTED EAST AND FANNY IS ALARMED ABOUT HER YES I SAID
HE HAD THE FACULTY--FOUND STILL IN SOME OLD NEGROES WHO CLING TO THE TRADITIONS OF SLAVERY DAYS--OF MAKING HIS EMPLOYER'S INTEREST HIS
WHEN I THINK OF THIS HOUSEFUL OF WOMEN AND A THING LIKE THAT OCCURRING GERTRUDE'S FACE WAS STILL SET AND WHITE
THE TOUCH OF THE COOL NIGHT AIR ON MY FACE
I SAW NOTHING OF HIM
ANNE HASWELL HAD MARRIED A CARPENTER IN HER NATIVE TOWN AND WAS A WIDOW
I DON'T THINK HE COULD HAVE GOT IN AND THE VOICE WAS NOT HIS MR JAMIESON GOT UP AND PACED THE FLOOR HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM
I WILL MAKE OUT THE CHECK
TO RICHFIELD I TOLD WARNER AND ON THE WAY I THOUGHT AND THOUGHT HARD
BUT LOUISE WAS LITERAL
IF HE WAS THE THIEF HE COULD RETURN THE MONEY OF COURSE
WHO WAS ALEX
PERHAPS YOU'D KEER TO SET ON THE PORCH AN REST YO'SELF IT WAS SO EVIDENT THAT THOMAS DID NOT WANT ME INSIDE THAT I WENT IN
AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I WAS ROUSED BY A REVOLVER SHOT
EVEN NOW I WONDER--WHAT DID THOMAS KNOW
THIS WAS NOTHING LESS THAN TO SEE LOUISE ARMSTRONG AND TO ATTEMPT TO DRAG FROM HER WHAT SHE KNEW OR SUSPECTED OF HALSEY'S DISAPPEARANCE
IT WAS BURNING WITH FEVER AND I TURNED TO WHERE THOMAS LINGERED IN THE HALLWAY
WELL SOMETHING DID I RETORTED
DON'T GIVE UP THE SEARCH FOR HIM
PERHAPS I CAN DO IT HE SAID
THE GARDENER WHO BELONGS HERE IS WORKING AT THE CLUB REMIND ME TO-MORROW TO SEND OUT A MAN FROM TOWN HE SAID
SHE COULD HEAR ARNOLD FUMBLING AT THE LOCK OUTSIDE
SOME WOMEN CAME DOWN A PATH TO THE ROAD AND INSPECTED THE AUTOMOBILE
AT WHICH SHE TURNED PURPLE
FOR IN THE INSTANT THAT I SAT THERE I SEEMED TO SEE THE COILS CLOSING AROUND JOHN BAILEY AS THE MURDERER OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG
IN A SHORT TIME ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED HOURS A CAR CAME RUSHING UP AND ANNE WATSON WHO HAD WAITED TO DRESS OPENED THE DOOR
WE'RE ON THE LID SO TO SPEAK
THE OTHER DETECTIVE AFTER A SHORT SCRUTINY OF THE DEAD MAN BUSIED HIMSELF WITH THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE
SHE HAD NO LOVE FOR HER STEPFATHER BUT HER DEVOTION TO HER MOTHER WAS ENTIRE SELF-SACRIFICING
WHEN HE STOOD UP HIS FACE WAS EXULTANT
INDEED FOR A TIME HE DID SO
THE CASANOVA ELECTRIC COMPANY SHUTS UP SHOP AND GOES HOME TO BED AT MIDNIGHT
THIS IS WHAT SHE SAYS
WHEN MR INNES WAS SPIRITED AWAY LIKE AND MISS LOUISE GOT SICK BECAUSE OF IT I THOUGHT THINGS HAD GONE FAR ENOUGH
SHE ISN'T OVERLY-FOND OF HER STEPFATHER BUT SHE ADORES HER MOTHER
DO YOU KNOW THAT EVERY DOLLAR YOU HAVE BOTH OF YOU IS IN THAT BANK GERTRUDE TRIED TO SPEAK BUT HALSEY STOPPED HER
DURING THE AFTERNOON HE HAD CALLED UP MR ARONSON A MEMBER OF THE BOARD AND SAID HE WAS ILL AND MIGHT NOT BE AT THE BANK FOR A DAY OR TWO
R A COLONIAL DAME MIXED UP WITH A VULGAR AND REVOLTING CRIME AND EVEN ATTEMPTING TO HOODWINK THE LAW
TO ME IT SEEMED THE SHREWD CALCULATION OF A CLEVER RASCAL
I DON'T--IN FACT I AM SURE OF IT
I LEANED AGAINST THE WALL FOR SUPPORT--MY KNEES WERE GIVING WAY
TWO MEN WERE STOOPING OVER SOME ONE WHO LAY ON THE GROUND
CHAPTER XIX CONCERNING THOMAS MR JAMIESON I SAID WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES ALONE AFTER DINNER THAT NIGHT THE INQUEST YESTERDAY SEEMED TO ME THE MEREST RECAPITULATION OF THINGS THAT WERE ALREADY KNOWN
JAMIESON WAS LOOKING SLIGHTLY SKEPTICAL AND THE CORONER MADE A NOTE
I THINK SHE STAYED ALL NIGHT IN THE ARMSTRONG HOUSE AND THE AGENT SAID SHE WAS CROSSING THE TRACK TO TAKE THE UP-TRAIN TO TOWN WHEN THE EXPRESS STRUCK HER ANOTHER CIRCLE I EXCLAIMED
GERTRUDE HAD BEEN SITTING STARING IN FRONT OF HER JUMPING AT EVERY SOUND
I HOPE YOU WILL ANSWER THEM
THE BULLET A THIRTY-EIGHT CALIBER HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE DEAD MAN'S CLOTHING AND WAS SHOWN TO THE JURY
A SECOND LATER OVER HALSEY'S SHOULDER I SAW SOMETHING THAT TURNED MY EMOTION INTO OTHER CHANNELS FOR BEHIND HIM IN THE SHADOWY CARD-ROOM WERE GERTRUDE AND ALEX THE GARDENER AND--THERE IS NO USE MINCING MATTERS--HE WAS KISSING HER
IT WAS ALMOST OPPRESSIVELY LONELY IN SPITE OF ITS BEAUTY AND I FELT A SICKENING PANG OF HOMESICKNESS FOR MY CITY AT NIGHT--FOR THE CLATTER OF HORSES FEET ON CEMENTED PAVING FOR THE LIGHTS THE VOICES THE SOUND OF CHILDREN PLAYING
BEFORE NOW MINOR OFFICIALS HAD BEEN USED TO CLOAK THE MISDEEDS OF MEN HIGHER UP
A MAN'S SENSE OF HUMOR SEEMS TO BE IN INVERSE PROPORTION TO THE GRAVITY OF HIS PROFESSION A MAN'S SENSE OF HUMOR IS A BARBAROUS AND A CRUEL THING MISS INNES HE ADMITTED
YOU CAN NOT LOOK AT ME WITH YOUR HONEST EYES AND SAY THAT I CAN NOT MARRY YOU SHE REPEATED MISERABLY
BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT LOUISE WAS HARDLY A GIRL TO TAKE REFUGE IN FLIGHT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
MR ARMSTRONG WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOUSE FROM WITHIN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE I BROKE IN
HE CROSSED THE ROOM IN A COUPLE OF STRIDES AND BENT OVER THE BED
IT WAS HALSEY'S WATCH
SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE HOUSE WHO SEEMED TO REGRET THE DEAD MAN AND EVEN SHE SEEMED RATHER SHOCKED THAN SORRY
HE'S NO FOOL
HALSEY HAD EVIDENTLY GONE OVER TO THE BED AND I SUPPOSE HE KISSED HER
ON TWO OCCASIONS I THINK HE SUCCEEDED ON THREE AT LEAST I CORRECTED
WHEN YOUR JACK COMES TO ME WITH SOME TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN HIS HANDS WHICH IS ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE LOST I SHALL BELIEVE HIM INNOCENT HALSEY THREW HIS CIGARETTE AWAY AND TURNED ON ME
CHAPTER II A LINK CUFF-BUTTON LIDDY'S KNEES SEEMED TO GIVE AWAY UNDER HER
IT WAS GERTRUDE WHO TURNED HIM OVER FINALLY UNTIL WE COULD SEE HIS WHITE FACE AND THEN SHE DREW A DEEP BREATH AND DROPPED LIMPLY TO HER KNEES
THE EAST ENTRANCE AND THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE WERE ALWAYS USED BY ARNOLD WHEN HE WAS OUT LATE AND SOMETIMES WHEN HE FORGOT HIS KEY HE WOULD RAP AND I WOULD GO DOWN AND LET HIM IN
LET HIM ALONE HE SAID
THE HOUSE LOOKED AS CALM AND PEACEFUL IN THE MORNING SUN AS IT HAD THE DAY I HAD BEEN COERCED INTO TAKING IT
IT REQUIRED TWO OR THREE POUNDINGS TO BRING THOMAS TO THE DOOR AND HE OPENED IT ONLY AN INCH OR SO
HE LEFT THE LODGE AND WENT UP TO THE HOUSE ABOUT TWO-THIRTY WAS ADMITTED AT THE EAST ENTRANCE AND CAME OUT AGAIN VERY SOON
MY MOTHER AND I HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED FOR YEARS WITH EVERY INDULGENCE EVERYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE A DISPLAY
THIS MORNING IT'S DUG OUT AND THERE'S PLASTER ON THE COOK'S TRUNK
AS I STOOD LISTENING INTENTLY I HEARD A SOUND NEAR ME
THE SUN CAME FINALLY AND FROM MY WINDOW I WATCHED THE TREES ALONG THE DRIVE TAKE SHADOWY FORM GRADUALLY LOSE THEIR GHOSTLIKE APPEARANCE BECOME GRAY AND THEN GREEN
WARNER HAD SOMETHING ON HIS MIND AND AFTER WE HAD TURNED INTO THE ROAD HE VOICED IT
I WANTED TO GO IN AND GIVE HER A GOOD SHAKING
I LEARNED THIS TO-DAY
I MUST GET WARNER FROM THE LODGE
AND I GATHERED THAT MR BURNS THE OTHER DETECTIVE HAD FOLLOWED A SIMILAR CAR FOR MILES AT DAWN ONLY TO FIND IT WAS A TOURING CAR ON AN ENDURANCE RUN
THE ONLY TROUBLE IS MISS INNES THEY WON'T BE APT TO COME BACK FOR A WHILE I SHOULDN'T REGARD THAT IN THE LIGHT OF A CALAMITY I REPLIED
BUT--DO YOU THINK YOU ARE WISE
I HAVE FOUND THE DRAGON FLY MISS INNES HE SAID
ANOTHER TRIAL AND THE DOOR WOULD OPEN
THE NEXT THUD--THUD--THUD--IT CAME APPARENTLY FROM THE WALL
I AM GLAD YOU HAVE COME BACK SHE SAID
BRIDGE I REAL ALOUD
YOU AIN'T TOOK NOTICE THAT THE BIG CLOCK IN THE HALL IS STOPPED I RECKON NONSENSE I SAID
MORE'N THAT THAT THERE CLOCK AIN'T STOPPED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS NOT SINCE MR ARMSTRONG'S FIRST WIFE DIED
BUT THE CHILD LUCIEN INTERESTED HER
HE--WILL BE HERE IN A FEW MOMENTS IF--EVERYTHING IS RIGHT WE SAT THERE THE THREE OF US WITHOUT ATTEMPT AT CONVERSATION
PAUL ARMSTRONG THE FATHER HAD BEEN MARRIED TWICE
AUNT RAY WHEN I FOUND JACK AT THE GREENWOOD CLUB LAST SATURDAY NIGHT HE WAS FRANTIC
WE ARE GOING TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION HE SAID I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU PICKED UP IN THE TULIP BED WE LOOKED STEADILY AT EACH OTHER
IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO DIVINE THAT HE FEARED NINA CARRINGTON A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN HE DID THE DEVIL
OUTSIDE THERE WERE EXCITED VOICES AND INCREDULOUS OATHS
THE DOCTOR'S EXAMINATION WAS OVER BUT HE HESITATED AND CLEARED HIS THROAT
HE CAME ABOUT HALF-PAST TWO
HE LOVED MONEY MISS INNES
I DEFY HIM HE SAID
YOU MUST GET UP-STAIRS HE SAID FIRMLY YOU AND MISS GERTRUDE TOO
LUCIEN WALLACE HE REPEATED
WE WENT UP-STAIRS RATHER EARLY AND THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR GERTRUDE AND I KEPT UP A RUNNING FIRE OF CONVERSATION
WHAT CAN I SAY TO YOU MISS INNES SHE SAID SLOWLY
THE MEN WERE VISIBLY IMPRESSED
HE STIRRED A LITTLE
WE FOUND THE LIVING-ROOM AND THE DRAWING-ROOM UNDISTURBED
PLEASE DON'T MENTION IT
THE REPORT OF THE CORONER'S PHYSICIAN CAME NEXT
HE WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO GET AWAY WITHOUT AN ALARM BEING RAISED AND HE TOOK THE OWL TRAIN TO TOWN
COMING JUST AFTER THE FIRE THE HOUSEHOLD WAS DEMORALIZED AND IT WAS NO SURPRISE TO ME TO FIND ALEX AND THE UNDER-GARDENER STRUGGLING DOWN-STAIRS WITH A HEAVY TRUNK BETWEEN THEM
AT MY REQUEST HALSEY HAD ALREADY SENT WORD OF THE FIRE TO THE AGENT FROM WHOM WE HAD SECURED THE HOUSE
LIDDY IS HAVING THE AWNINGS PUT UP AND THE WINDOW BOXES FILLED
HE WAS COMIN TO HISSELF WHEN I"--HE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT THE DETECTIVE
I THOUGHT I LOCKED THEM ALL BUT THERE WAS ONE OPEN THIS MORNING I WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AND DOWN THE HALL FOLLOWED BY MARY ANNE
HALSEY HOWEVER WAS MORE CORDIAL ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL CONSTRAINED ENOUGH
HIS AMUSED SMILE PUT ME ON MY METTLE AND I RIPPED OUT A PERFECTLY GOOD SCALLOP BEFORE I ANSWERED
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO KNOW
I PUSHED THE KNOB VIGOROUSLY TO ONE SIDE AND THE WHOLE MANTEL SWUNG LOOSE FROM THE WALL ALMOST A FOOT REVEALING A CAVERNOUS SPACE BEYOND
SHE CLUTCHED AT MY SLEEVE WHEN I WENT CLOSE TO HER AND REFUSED TO LET GO UNTIL SHE HAD TOLD HER STORY
DON'T SHOOT DOWN THE STAIRS IF YOU HEAR A NOISE
THE TRUNKS WERE BEING JERKED AROUND IN A FRANTIC SEARCH THE WINDOWS WERE THROWN OPEN ONLY TO SHOW A SHEER DROP OF FORTY FEET
IT SOUNDED STARTLED
YOU KNOW WHAT THREATENS HALSEY LOUISE SHE SAID ACCUSINGLY
HALSEY KNEW LOUISE ARMSTRONG,--HAD BEEN RATHER ATTENTIVE TO HER THE WINTER BEFORE BUT AS HALSEY WAS ALWAYS ATTENTIVE TO SOMEBODY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF IT SERIOUSLY ALTHOUGH SHE WAS A CHARMING GIRL
IT WAS A PART OF HER DEVOTION TO THE CHILD THAT SHE SHOULD BE AMBITIOUS FOR HIM
I WENT TO THE DOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE AND OPENED IT
LIDDY CRIED ALL DAY AND BECAUSE SHE KNEW I OBJECTED TO TEARS SNIFFLED AUDIBLY AROUND THE CORNER
SOMEHOW I FELT THAT WHATEVER WE FOUND WOULD BE IN THE CARD-ROOM OR ON THE STAIRCASE AND NOTHING BUT THE FEAR THAT HALSEY WAS IN DANGER DROVE ME ON
THE INQUEST WILL SHOW OF COURSE THAT THE BULLET THAT KILLED ARMSTRONG WAS A THIRTY-EIGHT
NOW MISS INNES HE SAID TURNING TO ME I MUST ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS
THE TOP OF THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT IS AS IMPOSSIBLE TO ME AS THE ELEVATION OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CHAIR
WHEN MY KNEES HAD STOPPED SHAKING I MOVED FORWARD SLOWLY NERVOUSLY UNTIL I HAD A PARTIAL VIEW OF WHAT WAS BEYOND THE DOOR
THE DEAD MAN HAD NO KEY AND YET MISS GERTRUDE TESTIFIED TO A FUMBLING AT THE LOCK AND THEN THE OPENING OF THE DOOR
THE PLAN WAS APPARENTLY THE ACME OF SIMPLICITY
THEY EXTENDED TWO FEET AND A HALF INTO EACH ROOM WHICH WITH THE THREE FEET OF SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTITIONS MADE EIGHT FEET TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
I'VE GOT SOME FEELINGS LEFT AND TO SEE YOU STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THAT STAIRCASE SHOOTIN THROUGH THE DOOR--I'LL NEVER BE THE SAME WOMAN AGAIN WELL I'M GLAD OF THAT--ANYTHING FOR A CHANGE I SAID
BUT THE LAW HAS LONG ARMS
WHAT DOES IT MATTER ABOUT ANY ONE IN THE WORLD BUT JUST THE TWO OF US
THE RAILROAD IN NEW MEXICO HAD APPARENTLY DRAINED THE BANKER'S PRIVATE FORTUNE AND HE DETERMINED TO RETRIEVE IT BY ONE STROKE
WE WERE NO LONGER ONLOOKERS WHO SAW A BATTLE PASSING AROUND THEM
AS FOR THOMAS HE WENT AROUND DEJECTED AND SAD AND I SAW THE DETECTIVE WATCHING HIM CLOSELY AT DINNER
IT WAS EARLY DAWN NOW AND FROM VOICES UNDER MY WINDOW I SURMISED THAT MR JARVIS AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE SEARCHING THE GROUNDS
THE FEW OCCASIONS ON WHICH I HAVE CLIMBED A STEP-LADDER HAVE ALWAYS LEFT ME DIZZY AND WEAK IN THE KNEES
BUT THE NEXT THING CAUGHT MY ATTENTION
HE IS SO BIG AND MASTERFUL THAT IF I DARED TO BE ANYTHING BUT RAPTUROUS OVER YOU HE WOULD THROW ME OUT OF A WINDOW
THERE AIN'T NO SURER TOKEN OF DEATH
THE MAIDS STAY MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HOLD THEM HERE GERTRUDE HAD GONE BACK TO HER ROOM AND WHILE I WAS DRINKING MY CUP OF HOT TEA MR JAMIESON CAME IN
AT FIRST I WAS NOT SURE BUT HALSEY'S ATTITUDE TOLD ME HE HAD HEARD AND WAS LISTENING
YOU HAVE HURT YOURSELF I SAID SHARPLY
LOUISE RECEIVED THE NEWS IN THE MOST UNEXPECTED MANNER AND WHEN GERTRUDE CAME OUT TO TELL ME HOW SHE HAD STOOD IT I THINK SHE WAS ALMOST SHOCKED
TO HAVE COME LIKE THIS I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO BREAK DOWN BUT SHE DID NOT
LUCIEN WALLACE GREAT
I BEGAN TO WONDER IF IT WERE NOT INDISCREET TO SAY THE LEAST THIS MIDNIGHT PROWLING IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH SUCH A DESERVEDLY BAD REPUTATION
HE WAS SHREWD ENOUGH TO DISARM SUSPICION AS TO THE GRAVER CHARGE THE EVENING DRAGGED ALONG SLOWLY
WHO WAS I TO PLAY PROVIDENCE IN THIS CASE
OR WAS OUR WHOLE THEORY WRONG
IT LOOKS AS IF THOMAS HAD STUMBLED ON TO SOME AFFAIR WHICH WAS MORE OR LESS DISCREDITABLE TO THE DEAD MAN AND WITH A CERTAIN LOYALTY TO THE FAMILY HAD KEPT IT TO HIMSELF
THE KNOCKING KEPT UP AND JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO CALL LIDDY SHE RAN THROUGH THE ROOM AND OUT INTO THE HALL
THE BEST EVIDENCE OF IT IS THIS
ONLY A SCRATCH
HE HAD A GOLF-STICK IN HIS HAND THAT HE HAD PICKED UP SOMEWHERE AND ON HER REFUSAL HE HAD STRUCK HER WITH IT
HE FOUND ONE FOUR CARS AWAY AND RAN BACK AGAIN
I WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE NERVOUS
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE HAD A FIRE UP THERE TOO
SIT UP AND TELL ME THE WHOLE THING ROSIE SAT UP THEN AND SNIFFLED
UP AT ONCE
THE QUARREL I BELIEVE HE PERSISTED WAS ABOUT MR ARMSTRONG'S CONDUCT TO YOU MISS GERTRUDE
HALSEY KICKED A TABORET VICIOUSLY
HIS ONLY WORDS AFTER HIS SURRENDER HAD BEEN SEND FOR MR ARMSTRONG AT ONCE THE TELEGRAPH MESSAGE WHICH HAD FINALLY REACHED THE PRESIDENT OF THE TRADERS BANK IN AN INTERIOR TOWN IN CALIFORNIA HAD BEEN RESPONDED TO BY A TELEGRAM FROM DOCTOR WALKER THE YOUNG PHYSICIAN WHO WAS TRAVELING WITH THE ARMSTRONG FAMILY SAYING THAT PAUL ARMSTRONG WAS VERY ILL AND UNABLE TO TRAVEL
DOCTOR WALKER AND PAUL ARMSTRONG--THE LATTER STILL LAME WHERE I HAD SHOT HIM--HURRIED ACROSS TO THE EMBANKMENT CERTAIN ONLY OF ONE THING
WHEN MR JAMIESON TELEPHONED THAT NIGHT WE HAD NEWS FOR HIM
MR TRAUTMAN WENT TO THE LOAN CLERK AND AFTER CERTAIN FORMALITIES HAD BEEN GONE THROUGH THE LOAN CLERK WENT TO THE VAULT
THE HANDSOME DISSIPATED FACE OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG PURGED OF ITS UGLY LINES WAS NOW ONLY PATHETIC
I AM NOT ASHAMED TO SAY THAT I DOUBLE-LOCKED THE HALL DOOR WHEN I WENT IN
THROWN PERHAPS FROM AN UPPER WINDOW
DID YOU KNOW OF THIS I ASKED HALSEY
I SHALL DREAM OF IT TO-NIGHT
ARNOLD ARMSTRONG HAD HAD NO KEY AND YET SHE SAID SHE HAD LOCKED THE EAST DOOR
I CONSIDER IT A MOST IMPORTANT CLUE WON'T THE DESCRIPTION DO NOT AS WELL AS THE ORIGINAL WELL I'M VERY SORRY I SAID AS CALMLY AS I COULD I--THE THING IS LOST
EVERY MAN WHO CUTS GRASS ISN'T A GARDENER MISS INNES AND JUST NOW IT IS OUR POLICY TO BELIEVE EVERY PERSON AROUND HERE A RASCAL UNTIL HE PROVES TO BE THE OTHER THING WARNER CAME UP WITH THE CAR THEN AND THE CONVERSATION STOPPED
THE DOOR IN THE EAST ENTRY HAD A HOLE THROUGH IT WHERE MY BULLET HAD GONE
IT WAS HALSEY'S IDEA THAT JOHN BAILEY COME TO THE HOUSE AS A GARDENER AND PURSUE HIS INVESTIGATIONS AS HE COULD
THEY HAVE BEEN KILLED SHE GASPED
I WAS STILL UNFAMILIAR WITH THE HOUSE AND I DID NOT REMEMBER THE DOOR
WELL IT ENDED BY MY ENGAGING THOMAS ON THE SPOT AT OUTRAGEOUS WAGES AND WITH PERMISSION TO SLEEP IN THE GARDENER'S LODGE EMPTY SINCE THE HOUSE WAS RENTED
AND HALSEY AND GERTRUDE KNEW IT KNOWING ME
WERE I A MAN I SHOULD BE A TRAPPER OF CRIMINALS TRAILING THEM AS RELENTLESSLY AS NO DOUBT MY SHEEPSKIN ANCESTOR DID HIS WILD BOAR
I UNDERSTAND YOUR ATTITUDE OF COURSE
THAT WAS THE STORY
AGAIN I SAW THE GROUP AROUND THE SILENT FIGURE ON THE GRASS AND AGAIN AS HAD HAPPENED AT THE GRAVE I HEARD ALEX'S VOICE TENSE AND TRIUMPHANT
WELL THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE HAS ON HE SUITCASE
OH A NEPHEW
I ONLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE MISS LOUISE WAS THERE
AS BAILEY WAS HIGHLY THOUGHT OF MR ARONSON MERELY EXPRESSED A REGRET
IT SEEMED TO ME AS I LISTENED THAT I HEARD STEALTHY FOOTSTEPS ON THE EAST PORCH BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH SHOUTING OUTSIDE THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
BUT BY THE TIME THE CASANOVA VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME TOILING UP THE HILL THE STABLE WAS A FURNACE WITH THE DRAGON FLY SAFE BUT BLISTERED IN THE ROAD
WHEN HE LEFT IT WAS AFTER TWO
BUT INSTEAD OF VAGUE TERRORS THERE WAS NOW THE REAL FEAR THAT HE MIGHT BE LYING IN SOME STRANGE HOSPITAL RECEIVING THE CASUAL ATTENTION COMMONLY GIVEN TO THE CHARITY CASES
IT WAS ARNOLD ARMSTRONG
CHAPTER XX DOCTOR WALKER'S WARNING WARNER WAS ON HIS KNEES IN A MOMENT FUMBLING AT THE OLD MAN'S COLLAR TO LOOSEN IT BUT HALSEY CAUGHT HIS HAND
IF THERE'S A SCRAP OF ANY KIND YOU HIKE FOR THE TIMBER WHICH WAS HALSEY'S SOLICITOUS CARE FOR ME PUT INTO VERNACULAR
I SHALL STAY HERE I THINK DOCTOR I DID NOT LIKE HIS FACE OR HIS MANNER
THE CONTRAST BETWEEN MY OLD DOCTOR AT HOME AND THE CASANOVA DOCTOR FRANK WALKER ALWAYS ROUSES ME TO WRATH AND DIGRESSION
NO SUCH PERSON GOT ON HERE TO-DAY
THE OLD MAN'S EYES WERE SHREWD UNDER HIS BUSHY EYEBROWS
IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE WAS SHOCKED BEYOND WORDS
THEN HE LEFT BY THE EAST ENTRANCE WHAT OCCURRED THEN WE TALKED FOR A FEW MINUTES DISCUSSING A PLAN MR BAILEY HAD IN MIND
SHE LAY PROPPED IN BED AND HALSEY SAT BESIDE HER UNREBUFFED AND HELD HER HAND WHILE SHE TALKED
WITH YOUR PERMISSION HE SAID I AM GOING TO EXAMINE THE CARD-ROOM AND THE STAIRCASE AGAIN
THE INSTANT THE BOY'S MOTHER APPEARS HERE CALL UP THAT NUMBER AND ASK FOR THE PERSON WHOSE NAME IS THERE
I MUST HAVE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME AND THE SEARCHERS WERE PROBABLY HUNTING OUTSIDE THE HOUSE DREDGING THE CREEK OR BEATING THE WOODLAND
COUPLED WITH THE FIGURE ON THE VERANDA THE AGENCY BY WHICH IT CLIMBED MIGHT BE ASSUMED
I DO NOT JUSTIFY MYSELF NOW BUT REMEMBER I WAS IN A PECULIAR POSITION TOWARD THE ARMSTRONG FAMILY
THE OLD MAN--HE WAS WHITE-HAIRED AND A LITTLE STOOPED BUT WITH AN IMMENSE IDEA OF HIS PERSONAL DIGNITY--GAVE ME HIS REASONS HESITATINGLY
AND AT THAT BECAUSE MY NERVES WERE GOING I GAVE HER A GOOD SHAKE
THE BIBLE SEZ LET YER LIGHT SHINE
THUS THERE IS A SENSE OF DESECRATION OF A REVERSAL OF THE EVERLASTING FITNESS OF THINGS IN RESURRECTING A BODY FROM ITS MOTHER CLAY
WHAT'S YOUR MOTHER'S NAME AND HE POINTED TO ME
MY HEART WAS THUMPING WILDLY IN MY EARS BUT I NODDED TO HIM TO GO AHEAD
THEN I RAN UP THE STAIRS AND ALONG THE CORRIDOR TO THE MAIN STAIRCASE
THERE IS SOMEBODY HIDING OR BEING HIDDEN IN THE LODGE
HE LEFT AFTER BREAKFAST SAYING THAT HE THOUGHT THE WORST OF THE DANGER WAS OVER AND THAT SHE MUST BE KEPT VERY QUIET
YOU MEAN--THE MURDERER I GASPED
HE SAID--HE SAID--'NOT SO FAST YOUNG LADY
ONLY DON'T LOSE A MOMENT THE NEW DETECTIVE HAD GONE AND A MOMENT LATER JAMIESON WENT RAPIDLY DOWN THE DRIVE THE COB'S FEET STRIKING FIRE AT EVERY STEP
AND NOW WHEN I NEED YOU MOST YOU FAIL ME
A BULLET WOUND
LOUISE ARMSTRONG WAS IN LOVE WITH HALSEY AND THE MAN SHE WAS GOING TO MARRY WAS DOCTOR WALKER
BUT THE DETECTIVE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WITNESSES AND THE DOCTOR ONLY CAME OVER AND FELT MY PULSE
HE WAS SO BIG AND SO BOYISH
HE SAW THAT SHE WAS EXCITED AND TIRED AND HE DREW HER INTO THE SITTING-ROOM AND MADE HER SIT DOWN
AND THE ONLY MAN WHO COULD HAVE CLEARED JACK CAN NEVER DO IT SHE SAID DESPAIRINGLY
BUT BEING AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WITH THE HANDICAP OF MY SEX MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH CRIME WILL PROBABLY BE MY LAST
I SAT DAZED AND BEWILDERED
OVER A CUP OF BLACK COFFEE THE DETECTIVE TOLD US WHAT HE HAD LEARNED OF HALSEY'S MOVEMENTS THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE HOUSEKEEPER WHO HAD BEEN LEFT IN CHARGE HAD MOVED FROM THE HOUSE TO THE GARDENER'S LODGE A FEW DAYS BEFORE
WHAT DID I TELL YOU SHE SAID DRAMATICALLY
WE MIGHT TAKE UP THE CONVERSATION WHERE WE LEFT OFF AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO HE SAID
FROM THAT TIME UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT WHEN MR BAILEY HAD SURRENDERED TO THE POLICE LITTLE WAS KNOWN OF HIS MOVEMENTS
AND SURE ENOUGH LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THE TWO PRIVATE DETECTIVES ACCOMPANIED BY MR JAMIESON WALKED DOWN THE MAIN STREET OF CASANOVA AND TOOK A CITY-BOUND TRAIN
IT CAME BY SPECIAL MESSENGER FROM TOWN AND WAS--MOST IMPORTANT
I MUST HAVE DOZED OFF
I'M NOT A CROAKER BUT--TAKE A WARNING
WE MUST GIVE THE BENEFIT OF EVERY DOUBT AFTER ALL
HE WAS NOT FAR AFTER ALL
HE WAS HAVIN TROUBLE--ONE MINUTE IT'D FLASH OUT AN THE NEX IT'D BE GONE
LOUISE HERE HIDING AT THE LODGE ILL AND ALONE
I COULD ONLY BREATHE A PRAYER OF THANKFULNESS THAT I HAD FOUND THE REVOLVER BEFORE ANY SHARP-EYED DETECTIVE HAD COME AROUND
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN WHY MOTHER RENTED THIS HOUSE
I HAD COME ALMOST SILENTLY IN MY EVENING SLIPPERS AND I HAD MY SECOND COLLISION OF THE EVENING ON THE ROAD JUST ABOVE THE HOUSE
SOME ONE IS SEARCHING FOR THE SECRET ROOM AND THE INVADERS AND THE HOLES IN THE PLASTER HAVE BEEN IN THE PROGRESS OF HIS OR HER--INVESTIGATIONS HER I ASKED
NOT ONLY HAD HE ALARMED--LOUISE AND HIMSELF HE ADMITTED--ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE BUT HE HAD DUG THE HOLE IN THE TRUNK-ROOM WALL AND LATER SENT ELIZA INTO HYSTERIA
THERE WAS FOLKS HERE AND THERE GOIN HOME AND ALONG BY THE PATH TO THE COUNTRY CLUB I SEEN TWO MEN
I SHOULD LEARN EVERYTHING THAT HAD PUZZLED ME
GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR I SAID FORMALLY
THIS HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU LIDDY HELPED ME BACK TO BED AND UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS IN DANGER OF FREEZING TO DEATH PUT A HOT-WATER BOTTLE OVER MY HEART AND ANOTHER AT MY FEET
HE WAS COVERED WITH MUD AND HIS HAT WAS GONE
BUT THOMAS WAS NOT ON THE VERANDA NOR WAS HE INSIDE THE HOUSE
IT WAS NOT UNTIL GERTRUDE AND ROSIE HAD GONE AND SUNNYSIDE HAD SETTLED DOWN FOR THE NIGHT WITH WINTERS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE THAT MR JAMIESON BROACHED A SUBJECT HE HAD EVIDENTLY PLANNED BEFORE HE CAME
AS BEFORE THE NIGHT ALARM HAD FOUND THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS GONE
HOW DID YOU HEAR IT I MET THE OLDEST STEWART GIRL TO-DAY THE DOCTOR'S DAUGHTER AND SHE TOLD ME THEY HAD NOT GONE BACK TO TOWN AFTER THE FUNERAL
I HAVE A TELEGRAM FOR HER MRS INNES
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE WENT
HIS REFERENCES WERE GOOD--HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED BY THE BRAYS UNTIL THEY WENT TO EUROPE AND HE LOOKED YOUNG AND VIGOROUS
YOU PICKED UP SOMETHING HE SAID GOOD-HUMOREDLY WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO TELL ME ABOUT LATER AM I INDEED I WAS POLITELY CURIOUS
I THINK IT IS MURDER AT THE WORD THERE WAS A COMMOTION
I'D BETTER TELL WHAT HE TOLD ME ALEX BROKE IN
FEVER-FLUSHED ILL AS SHE WAS I RECOGNIZED LOUISE ARMSTRONG
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE HAMPER I ASKED
WITHOUT A SOUND SHE SANK DOWN LEAVING ME STARING AT THE WINDOW IN PETRIFIED AMAZEMENT
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE EVENING HAD BEEN FULL OF SIGNIFICANT HAPPENINGS HAD I ONLY HELD THE KEY
IT WAS ONLY THEN THAT I KNEW
I WILL TAKE THE BLANKET SHE DREW HERSELF UP QUICKLY AS IF IN PROTEST BUT SHE FOUND NOTHING TO SAY
ROSIE CAME UP TO THE BED AND SMOOTHED THE WHITE COUNTERPANE
THEN THE TALLER OF THE TWO STARTED ON A DOG-TROT ALONG THE TRAIN LOOKING FOR AN EMPTY
HE WAS SITTING ON A BIG ROCK HIS BACK TO ME AND HE HAD SOMETHING WHITE IN HIS HAND AS IF HE WAS TYING UP HIS FOOT
ROSIE'S BASKET AND MRS WATSON'S BLANKET CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING
LIDDY WAS ALARMED TO THE POINT OF HYSTERIA AND SENT FOR DOCTOR STEWART JUST AFTER BREAKFAST
THE ARBUTUS WAS FRAGRANT IN THE WOODS UNDER THE DEAD LEAVES AND ON THE WAY FROM THE STATION A SHORT MILE WHILE THE CAR STUCK IN THE MUD I FOUND A BANK SHOWERED WITH TINY FORGET-ME-NOTS
THERE WAS A SUBTLE CHANGE IN BOTH
CHAPTER X THE TRADERS BANK THE MORNING AFTER HALSEY'S RETURN WAS TUESDAY
NO DOUBT SHE KNEW OF THE FIRE AND IN VIEW OF MY REFUSAL TO GIVE UP THE HOUSE AN INTERVIEW WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN UNPLEASANT ENOUGH
IT WAS THE BODY OF A MAN A GENTLEMAN IN A DINNER COAT AND WHITE WAISTCOAT STAINED NOW WITH BLOOD--THE BODY OF A MAN I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
THE DOCTOR HAS A PATIENT WHO WEARS BLACK AND DOES NOT RAISE HER VEIL
JUST NOW IT WAS SOMEWHAT TREMULOUS
THIS HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE FORTY-EIGHT HOURS FOR ALL OF US HE STOOD STARING AT ME AND I COULD SEE THE HORROR OF THE SITUATION DAWNING IN HIS FACE
I HOPED THEY WERE COMING CLOSER BUT AFTER A TIME THE SOUNDS DIED AWAY BELOW AND I WAS LEFT TO THE SILENCE AND HEAT TO THE WEIGHT OF THE DARKNESS TO THE OPPRESSION OF WALLS THAT SEEMED TO CLOSE IN ON ME AND STIFLE ME
THE PIECE OF EVIDENCE YOU MENTION DOCTOR STEWART'S STORY IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE HAVE TO TAKE CAUTIOUSLY
IN THE CHIMNEY
I WANTED TO
WHERE ARNOLD HAD GIVEN MONEY FOR LUCIEN'S SUPPORT AS THE YEARS WENT ON HE FORCED MONEY FROM ANNE WATSON INSTEAD UNTIL SHE WAS ALWAYS PENNILESS
C
THERE BEING LITTLE OR NOTHING TO DO SHE SEEMED TO SPEND HER TIME SMOOTHING THE WRINKLES FROM THE COUNTERPANE
THE SHAKE BRACED HER ANYHOW AND SHE SEEMED TO PULL HERSELF TOGETHER
HE KNEW THE SIREN
MRS WATSON AND LIDDY WERE MAKING TEA IN THE KITCHEN
WELL I'LL NOT BE A BABY AND I'LL GIVE YOU UP THE MINUTE YOU SAY I DON'T LOVE YOU AND I DO LOVE--SOME ONE ELSE I CAN NOT SAY THAT SHE BREATHED BUT VERY SOON I SHALL MARRY--THE OTHER MAN I COULD HEAR HALSEY'S LOW TRIUMPHANT LAUGH
THEN YOU DIDN'T LOCK THE LAUNDRY LAST NIGHT I LOCKED IT TIGHT AND PUT THE KEY IN THE KITCHEN ON ITS NAIL VERY WELL THEN YOU FORGOT A WINDOW MARY ANNE HESITATED
WHO AND WHAT IS THE WOMAN NINA CARRINGTON
IF I KNEW NOW WHY ROSIE HAD TAKEN THE BASKET OF DISHES I DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD SPOKEN TO HER AND FOLLOWED HER ALONG THE DRIVE
IT WAS SUICIDAL TO GO BACK HALSEY WAS LOOKING STEADILY THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE BREAKFAST-ROOM BUT IT WAS EVIDENT HE SAW NOTHING
HAD GERTRUDE BEEN THE FUGITIVE IN THE CLOTHES CHUTE
WE HAD ONE PEACEFUL DAY--THEN LIDDY TOOK SICK IN THE NIGHT
WHAT DID HE SUSPECT
SHE IS ILL AND NOT ABLE TO BE MOVED
ON THE CENTER-TABLE OPEN WAS A SEALSKIN TRAVELING BAG
NO INDEED
HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH SHE REPLIED AND I COULD SEE MR JAMIESON'S SNAP AS IF HE HAD MADE A DISCOVERY
IF I KNEW THAT LOUISE WAS IN THE LODGE I DID NOT KNOW WHY SHE WAS THERE
YOUNG LADIES ARE CHANGEABLE THESE DAYS HE SAID
BUT GERTRUDE KNOWS THAT JACK AND I LEFT THE HOUSE BEFORE THIS THING--THIS HORRIBLE MURDER--OCCURRED MR JAMIESON DOES NOT BELIEVE ME GERTRUDE SAID DREARILY
I PICKED IT UP IN THE HALL I ADDED INDIFFERENTLY
WHAT A SHOCKING NIGHT YOU HAVE HAD SHE CAME OVER AND SAT DOWN ON THE BED AND I SAW SHE LOOKED VERY TIRED AND WORN
I FORGOT MY FEAR OF A HEIGHT AND ADVANCED BOLDLY ALMOST TO THE EDGE OF THE ROOF
THE WOMAN BEYOND DOUBT WAS THE ONE WHO HAD CONSULTED ME ABOUT THE CHILD AT THIS HINT OF SCANDAL MRS OGDEN FITZHUGH SAT UP VERY STRAIGHT
I AM PARTICULAR ABOUT MR BAILEY BECAUSE HE WAS A PROMINENT FIGURE IN WHAT HAPPENED LATER
IT WAS THE WOMAN WITH THE PITTED FACE
CALL OUT THE WINDOWS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE I WHISPERED
I SAW THAT HE THOUGHT THE INFORMATION WAS IMPORTANT AND TO MY SUGGESTION THAT WE PUT AN ADDITIONAL LOCK ON THE EAST WING DOOR HE OPPOSED A STRONG NEGATIVE
YOURS WAS LOADED AND I WAS AFRAID OF WHAT JACK MIGHT DO
MISS RACHEL I'D BE THANKFUL IF YOU'D GIVE ME MY MONTH'S WAGES TO-MORROW
NOW THEN HE SAID WHEN THE BOY HAD TAKEN THE LEAD-PENCIL AND WAS TESTING ITS USEFULNESS ON THE DETECTIVE'S CUFF NOW THEN I'LL BET YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR NAME IS I DO SAID THE BOY
JUST AS I REACHED THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE I THOUGHT I HEARD SOME ONE COMING
THE HOUSEHOLD STAFF WAS AGAIN DEPLETED THAT AFTERNOON
SOME ONE HAD DRILLED A HOLE IN THE UNFINISHED WALL OF THE BALL-ROOM PASSING BETWEEN THE BRICKS OF THE PARTITION AND SHOOTING THROUGH THE UNRESISTING PLASTER OF ELIZA'S ROOM WITH SUCH FORCE AS TO SEND THE ROD FLYING ON TO HER BED
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A BOARDING-HOUSE IN TOWN
WHY THERE'S A DOZEN FRENCH WINDOWS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AND THE BILLIARD-ROOM WING AND EVERY ONE OPENS ON A PORCH
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE SHOWN IT IN THE KITCHEN AND INSTEAD OF MY BEING ABLE TO SLIP DOWN TO THE BRIDGE TO-NIGHT QUIETLY AND SEE WHO IS THERE THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD WILL BE GOING IN A PROCESSION NOBODY KNOWS IT LIDDY SAID HUMBLY
ELLA STEWART SAYS MRS ARMSTRONG HAS AGED TERRIBLY AND LOOKS AS IF SHE IS HARDLY ABLE TO WALK I LAY AND THOUGHT OVER SOME OF THESE THINGS UNTIL MIDNIGHT
GERTRUDE WHO WAS NEVER NERVOUS IN THE DARK WENT ALONE DOWN THE DRIVE TO THE GATE AND STOOD THERE LOOKING ALONG THE YELLOWISH LINE OF THE ROAD WHILE I WAITED ON THE TINY VERANDA
ONE THE SHORT ONE SEEMED TO LIMP
THIS IS YOUR HOME MY DEAR AND OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD HALSEY'S OLD AUNT OUGHT TO MAKE YOU WELCOME SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY I THOUGHT
ROSIE TOOK CHARGE OF THE DINING-ROOM AND PANTRY IN THE ABSENCE OF A BUTLER AND EXCEPT FOR THE WARNING OF THE CASANOVA DOCTOR EVERYTHING BREATHED OF PEACE
NO DOUBT YOUR DETECTIVE ALREADY KNOWS THAT AND DISCREDITS ALL GERTRUDE TOLD HIM AND WHEN SHE WENT BACK IT WAS TO GET--THE TELEGRAM PROBABLY HALSEY SAID SLOWLY
WARNER CAME IN THEN WITH A HANDFUL OF SMALL TOOLS AND MR JAMIESON WENT WITH HIM TO THE BASEMENT
PEOPLE THAT TRUST THEMSELVES A DOZEN MILES FROM THE CITY IN STRANGE HOUSES WITH SERVANTS THEY DON'T KNOW NEEDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY WAKE UP SOME MORNING AND FIND THEIR THROATS CUT AFTER WHICH CAREFULLY VEILED SARCASM LIDDY RELAPSED INTO GLOOM
BUT JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO TURN DOWN THE PATH I HEARD STEPS COMING TOWARD ME AND I SHRANK INTO THE BUSHES
BUT CERTAIN THINGS HUNG OVER ME CONSTANTLY
AS HE HELPED ME IN HOWEVER THE DETECTIVE SAID SOMETHING FURTHER
THE ARMSTRONGS I REPEATED
SHE WAS A WOMAN OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DIGNITY MOST EFFICIENT SO FAR AS I COULD SEE ALTHOUGH LIDDY WOULD HAVE FOUND FAULT IF SHE DARED
ANOTHER MAN HE BROUGHT A FRIEND WITH HIM TO STAY OVER SUNDAY MR BAILEY MR JOHN BAILEY THE CASHIER OF THE TRADERS BANK I BELIEVE AND I KNEW THAT SOME ONE AT THE GREENWOOD CLUB HAD TOLD
I WENT AROUND BY THE HALL AND INTO HER BEDROOM THAT WAY
THERE WERE NO FRAGMENTS OF CHINA BUT WHERE THE GROVE BEGAN I PICKED UP A SILVER SPOON
HE DIED A LONG TIME AGO
IT'S BAD ENOUGH ISN'T IT
HE RAPPED AT THE EAST DOOR AND I ADMITTED HIM THE SILENCE IN THE ROOM WAS INTENSE
WELL--WHAT THOMAS KNEW WILL BE BURIED WITH HIM HALSEY SUGGESTED THAT THE GROUNDS BE SEARCHED BUT MR JAMIESON VETOED THE SUGGESTION
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT WITHOUT FULLER CONFIDENCE FROM BOTH THE CHILDREN--THEY ARE ALWAYS CHILDREN TO ME--I SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO LEARN ANYTHING
HALSEY PROWLED UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE EAST WING NOW IN THE CARD-ROOM NOW IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM AND NOW AND THEN BLOWING HIS CLOUDS OF TOBACCO SMOKE AMONG THE PINK AND GOLD HANGINGS OF THE DRAWING-ROOM
SHE HAD KEPT TO HER ROOMS UNTIL THE MORNING SHE LEFT
HE ASKED ME TO DESCRIBE THE LINK ACCURATELY AND I DID SO WHILE HE GLANCED AT A LIST HE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET
SINCE I CAME HERE ONE MAN HAS BEEN SHOT AND ANOTHER ONE HAS DIED FROM SHOCK
TO HIM CONSCIOUSNESS WAS RECOVERY
BY ALTERING THE PLANS FOR----ROOMS MAY BE POSSIBLE
BY ALTERING THE PLANS FOR----ROOMS MAY BE POSSIBLE
HER STEPFATHER AND HER MOTHER WERE STILL IN CALIFORNIA--THAT WAS ALL SHE WOULD SAY ABOUT THEM
SHE OWNS TO FORTY--WHICH IS ABSURD
HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE GRAVE GIVING UP ITS DEAD MR JAMIESON WAS GOING THROUGH THE OLD MAN'S POCKETS AND GERTRUDE WAS COMPOSING HIS ARMS FOLDING THEM ACROSS HIS WHITE SHIRT-BOSOM ALWAYS SO SPOTLESS
I WORKED FEVERISHLY
THE GRASS WAS HEAVY WITH DEW AND MAN-LIKE HALSEY CHOSE THE SHORTEST WAY ACROSS THE LAWN
WHO HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MURDER
YOU'LL HAVE A NICE TIME AT YOUR SISTER'S I WENT ON
THEY WERE PROPERTY AT SO MUCH AN ACRE
ARCHITECTS WERE NOT USUALLY ERRATIC
THE PLASTER CAME OUT EASILY
I TOLD HIM OF THE EXPERIENCE LOUISE ARMSTRONG HAD HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE AND ABOUT THE MAN WHO HAD SO FRIGHTENED ROSIE ON THE DRIVE
THE LID OF THE CASKET HAD BEEN RAISED AND A SILVER PLATE ON IT PROVED WE HAD MADE NO MISTAKE
THERE IS A SORT OF MELANCHOLY PLEASURE TO BE HAD OUT OF A FUNERAL WITH ITS POMP AND CEREMONY BUT I SHRANK FROM A DEATH-BED
WHEN AT THE END OF A YEAR FATHER MET HIM DRIVING IN HIS HIGH SIDE-BAR BUGGY WITH THE WHITE MARE AMBLING ALONG AND ASKED FOR A BILL THE DOCTOR USED TO GO HOME ESTIMATE WHAT HIS SERVICES WERE WORTH FOR THAT PERIOD DIVIDE IT IN HALF--I DON'T THINK HE KEPT ANY BOOKS--AND SEND FATHER A STATEMENT IN A CRAMPED HAND ON A SHEET OF RULED WHITE PAPER
ARNOLD ARMSTRONG AND HIS FRIENDS COULD SIT HERE AND PLAY CARDS ALL NIGHT AND STUMBLE UP TO BED IN THE EARLY MORNING WITHOUT HAVING THE FAMILY SEND IN A POLICE CALL LIDDY AND I GOT AS FAR AS THE CARD-ROOM AND TURNED ON ALL THE LIGHTS
I THINK HE FELT WHO IT WAS BEFORE HE REALLY SAW HER
HE HAS NOT COME BACK I SAID QUIETLY
MRS WATSON AND THOMAS HAD HAD THEIR HANDS FULL AND AT LAST ROSIE HAD BEEN ENLISTED TO HELP THEM
HE WAS GOING VERY FAST--THE FLAGMAN AT THE CAROL STREET CROSSING SAYS HE SAW THE CAR PASS
IT IS TO THE FEMININE AS THE HUG OF A BEAR IS TO THE SCRATCH OF--WELL;--ANYTHING WITH CLAWS
WHEN THEY GOT THERE THE CAR WAS STILL STANDING THE HEADLIGHT BROKEN AND THE BONNET CRUSHED BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN THE DETECTIVE WENT AWAY IMMEDIATELY AND TO GERTRUDE AND ME WAS LEFT THE WOMAN'S PART TO WATCH AND WAIT
HE HAD A KEY NO DOUBT BUT WHY HE SHOULD STEAL INTO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE I CAN NOT IMAGINE
THERE WERE LIGHTS MOVING AROUND BELOW AND SOME OF THE MAIDS WERE STANDING GAPING DOWN
AFTER THAT MY RESPONSIBILITY WAS CHIEFLY POSTAL WITH THREE MONTHS EVERY SUMMER IN WHICH TO REPLENISH THEIR WARDROBES LOOK OVER THEIR LISTS OF ACQUAINTANCES AND GENERALLY TO TAKE MY FOSTER-MOTHERHOOD OUT OF ITS NINE MONTHS RETIREMENT IN CAMPHOR
W.--PRESUMABLY DOCTOR WALKER
ANYHOW HE'S NOT INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THAT I CAN SEE THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PARTY HAD COME BACK NOW AND NO ONE HAD FOUND ANY TRACE OF THE OLD MAN
IT DOUBLES A WOMAN'S AGE
I BELIEVE HE HAS A MILLION AT LEAST AS THE RESULT AND THAT HE WILL NEVER COME BACK
MISS RACHEL SOMEBODY WAS SAYING OVER AND OVER
WAS JACK BAILEY AN ACCOMPLICE OR A VICTIM IN THE LOOTING OF THE TRADERS BANK
OF MY SHARE IN DISCOVERING THE SECRET CHAMBER THEY HAVE BEEN SINGULARLY SILENT
THE OLD MAN WAS ALONE WARNER NOT HAVING ARRIVED AND AT FIRST HE WAS UNCERTAIN ABOUT OPENING THE DOOR
YOUR NEPHEW BROUGHT BAILEY OVER
ON HER THE OLDER GIRL HAD LAVISHED ALL THE LOVE OF AN IMPULSIVE AND EMOTIONAL NATURE
IN THE CHIMNEY I SHRIEKED
GERTRUDE WAS LOCKED IN HER ROOM WITH A HEADACHE AND I HAD LUNCHEON ALONE
YES I SAID THIS IS MISS INNES MISS INNES SHE SAID VOLUBLY I HAVE JUST RECEIVED A VERY STRANGE TELEGRAM FROM MY COUSIN MRS ARMSTRONG
IN THE SHADOW OF THE ARMSTRONG GRANITE SHAFT WE STOPPED
I HAD EXPECTED A SECRET ROOM AT THE VERY LEAST AND I THINK EVEN MR JAMIESON HAD FANCIED HE MIGHT AT LAST HAVE A CLUE TO THE MYSTERY
ON THE MOMENT OF STARTING WEST AT ANDREWS STATION WHERE MR JAMIESON HAD LOCATED THE CAR HE READ THAT THE BANK HAD CLOSED AND GOING BACK SURRENDERED HIMSELF
GO RIGHT IN AND CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES I SAID SHARPLY
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO JUDGE THE FLIGHT OF TIME
WHO WAS THE MIDNIGHT INTRUDER WHO HAD SO ALARMED LIDDY AND MYSELF
I MUST DO IT MYSELF SHE SAID DULLY
THE DAY OF THE MOTOR-CAR HAD COME
THERE WAS NO NEED OF THE INSTRUMENTS
I WAS FURIOUSLY ANGRY--AT MYSELF AT THE MANTEL DOOR AT EVERYTHING
JOHN BAILEY APPEARS I HAD DINNER SERVED IN THE BREAKFAST-ROOM
LIKE THE CONDEMNED WHO SLEEP AND EAT THE NIGHT BEFORE EXECUTION I WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO SUFFER APPREHENSION
I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO HAVE HIM THERE WHEN EXCITEMENTS BEGAN TO COME THICK AND FAST
BUT I FANCIED I CAUGHT A SUDDEN GLANCE AT GERTRUDE A FLASH OF SOMETHING THAT DIED AS IT CAME
YOU HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE HOUSE I HOPE MISS INNES HE SAID
AGAIN I WAS WORKING IN A CIRCLE
THERE WERE TIMES OF COURSE WHEN I WAS DISPOSED TO THROW ALL THOSE SUSPICIONS ASIDE AND FIX DEFINITELY ON THE UNKNOWN WHOEVER THAT MIGHT BE
THE HABITS OF A LIFETIME MADE HIM CAUTIOUS
AND I KNEW THAT HE SUSPECTED THE DISCREDITED CASHIER OF THE TRADERS BANK
MEN ARE AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE
WHAT IS WRONG THEN WE SHALL HAVE TO FIND HIM SHE ASSERTED
AS FOR THOMAS AND HIS FOREBODINGS IT WAS ALWAYS MY BELIEF THAT A NEGRO IS ONE PART THIEF ONE PART PIGMENT AND THE REST SUPERSTITION
AFTER AN INTERVAL MR TRAUTMAN SAW THE LOAN CLERK EMERGE FROM THE VAULT AND GO TO THE ASSISTANT CASHIER
BUT TELL ME THE WHOLE THING I DID FINALLY FROM THE BEGINNING AND WHEN I TOLD OF JACK BAILEY'S BEING IN THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT HE GAVE A LONG WHISTLE
FOR TWENTY YEARS I HAD HAD THE WINDOW-BOXES FILLED IN THE SPRING THE CARPETS LIFTED THE AWNINGS PUT UP AND THE FURNITURE COVERED WITH BROWN LINEN
BY THE TIME I GOT THEM OFF HALSEY WAS SERIOUS AGAIN AND I LISTENED TO HIS STORY
IF HE HAD BEEN ALTOGETHER FRANK ABOUT JACK BAILEY AND IF THE DAY AFTER THE FIRE HE HAD TOLD ME WHAT HE SUSPECTED THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO HARROWING PERIOD FOR ALL OF US WITH THE BOY IN DANGER
HE CAME TO ASK US TO GET OUT SHE SAID PICKING UP HER BOOK WITH A JERK
IN OTHER WORDS AS THE MURDERED MAN HAD BEEN FOUND DEAD AT THE FOOT OF A STAIRCASE IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THE SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED BY SOME ONE HIGHER UP ON THE STAIRS
EVERYTHING ELSE IS LOCKED AWAY SHE REPLIED
THEN I PUSHED THE DOOR OPEN
I HAVE A HOUSEFUL OF MAIDS THAT WILL BEAR WATCHING ONE AND ALL
SHE WILL NOT SAY WHAT THEY WERE BUT THE GIRL EVIDENTLY SUSPECTS WHAT HAS OCCURRED
THE OTHER IS PUZZLING THE FIRST WAS A SHEET OF CLUB NOTE-PAPER ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN OVER AND OVER THE NAME HALSEY B
HOW LONG I SLEPT I DO NOT KNOW
I WAS LYING ON THE BED IN LOUISE'S ROOM WITH THE CHERUB ON THE CEILING STARING DOWN AT ME AND THERE WAS A BLANKET FROM MY OWN BED THROWN OVER ME
HE EXAMINED THE PANELING OF THE WAINSCOTING ABOVE AND BELOW THE STAIRS EVIDENTLY LOOKING FOR A SECRET DOOR AND SUDDENLY THERE FLASHED INTO MY MIND THE RECOLLECTION OF A SCRAP OF PAPER THAT MR JAMIESON HAD FOUND AMONG ARNOLD ARMSTRONG'S EFFECTS
NO SHE SAID FINALLY
THEN I THINK WE GET AT IT BY ELIMINATION
ONE OF THE MEN FROM THE CLUB CAME IN ASKED FOR THE TELEPHONE AND I COULD HEAR HIM EXCITEDLY TALKING SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT CORONERS AND DETECTIVES
GOOD EVENING HE SAID MANAGING TO INCLUDE GERTRUDE IN HIS BOW
IT WAS HALSEY'S WAY ALWAYS WITH WOMEN
AFTER GERTRUDE JOINED US WE AVOIDED ANY FURTHER MENTION OF THE MURDER
THE STABLE BURNED TO THE GROUND WHILE THE CROWD CHEERED AT EVERY FALLING RAFTER AND THE VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT SPRAYED IT WITH A GARDEN HOSE
I WOULD LOVE HONEST POVERTY BETTER NEVER MIND I SAID
THE CANDLE ABOVE MADE A FAINT GLEAM DOWN THE WELL-LIKE STAIRCASE AND AT THAT MOMENT WITH A SECOND NO MORE TO SPARE I THOUGHT OF A PLAN
ONLY--HE MUST BE FOUND THE STOCKY MAN HAD SAID NOTHING
HE SCRUTINIZED THE WHOLE PLACE CAREFULLY EXAMINING THE STAIRS AND THE LOCK
HE PLAYED A FAIR GAME OF CRIBBAGE BUT HE CHEATED AT SOLITAIRE
ANNE WATSON LIES NOT FAR FROM THE MAN SHE KILLED AND WHO AS SURELY CAUSED HER DEATH
I HAD READ OF CASES WHERE BODIES HAD BEEN FOUND LOCKED IN CARS ON ISOLATED SIDINGS IN THE WEST AND MY SPIRITS WENT DOWN WITH EVERY HOUR
OH HALSEY WHAT CAN HE DO NOW JACK I SAID SCORNFULLY
DOCTOR WALKER CAME UP SOME TIME JUST AFTER LUNCHEON AND ASKED FOR ME
I JUSTIFIED MYSELF BY REFLECTING THAT IF THE ARMSTRONGS CHOSE TO LEAVE PICTURES IN UNSAFE POSITIONS AND TO RENT A HOUSE WITH A FAMILY GHOST THE DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY WAS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY NOT MINE
IF YOU ARE AFRAID I WILL GO WITH YOU BUT FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T TRY TO HIDE BEHIND ME THE HOUSE WAS A TYPICAL SUMMER RESIDENCE ON AN EXTENSIVE SCALE
AT THREE-THIRTY THERE WAS A HASTILY CONVENED BOARD MEETING WITH SOME STORMY SCENES AND LATE IN THE AFTERNOON A NATIONAL BANK EXAMINER WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE BOOKS
WHEN HE DID HE STOOD FOR ONE MOMENT AS IF PARALYZED THEN HE GAVE A HORRIBLE YELL AND DROPPING HIS PAPERS BOLTED ACROSS THE LAWN TO THE ROAD WITHOUT STOPPING TO LOOK AROUND
THEY OCCUPIED THE END OF THE EAST WING BEYOND THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE AND WE HAD NOT EVEN OPENED THEM
NOTHING BUT A COUPLE OF PIPES TWO INCHES ACROSS AND STANDING PERHAPS EIGHTEEN INCHES HIGH AND THREE FEET APART WITH A CAP TO PREVENT RAIN FROM ENTERING AND RAISED TO PERMIT THE PASSAGE OF AIR
HE CAN SCARCELY SPEAK HE'S AS FULL OF SUPERSTITION AS AN EGG IS OF MEAT I SAID
WHEN HE SAW ME HOWEVER HE DID NOT WAIT FOR ANY RETORT ON MY PART
THE BOX WAS EMPTY--THE CUFF-LINK HAD DISAPPEARED
I LEARNED AFTERWARDS THAT HE CALLED AT DOCTOR WALKER'S UNDER PRETENSE OF AN ATTACK OF ACUTE INDIGESTION AND BEFORE HE LEFT HAD INQUIRED ABOUT THE EVENING TRAINS TO THE CITY
HE WAS A TALL LANKY INDIVIDUAL RAGGED AND DIRTY AND JUST NOW HE LOOKED BOTH TERRIFIED AND EMBARRASSED
IN HIS HANDS
HE SAT BACK IN A BIG CHAIR WITH HIS FACE IN THE SHADOW AND MY HEART FAIRLY ACHED FOR HIM
AND THIS IN A HOUSE WITH TWENTY-TWO ROOMS AND FIVE BATHS
THE MAN WAS UNSCRUPULOUS AND WITH THE GIRL AS A BAIT PAUL ARMSTRONG SOON HAD HIM FAST
I'LL BE GOING TO MY SISTER'S VERY WELL I SAID TO HER EVIDENT AMAZEMENT
MY MOTHER MUST HAVE RENTED SUNNYSIDE WITHOUT TELLING MY STEPFATHER AND--MISS INNES DID YOU EVER HEAR OF ANY ONE BEING WRETCHEDLY POOR IN THE MIDST OF LUXURY
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GRATEFUL FOR THAT ONE NIGHT'S PEACE
I WONDERED VAGUELY IF MY ORIGINAL IDEA OF A SECRET ENTRANCE TO A HIDDEN CHAMBER COULD BE RIGHT AFTER ALL AND IF WE WERE HOUSING SOME ERRATIC GUEST WHO PLAYED PRANKS ON US IN THE DARK AND DESTROYED THE WALLS THAT HE MIGHT LISTEN HIDDEN SAFELY AWAY TO OUR AMAZED INVESTIGATIONS
TO GO BACK TO PAUL ARMSTRONG
SITUATED AS ITS WAS BEYOND THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE NOTHING BUT AN EXTREMITY OF EXCITEMENT WOULD HAVE MADE HER PASS IT AFTER DARK
AS I CAME SLOWLY DOWN WINTERS STEPPED BACK AND ALEX STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF LOOKING AT ME ACROSS THE BODY WITH IMPENETRABLE EYES
THEN I REMEMBER TURNING ON THE LIGHTS AND FINDING HALSEY WHITE WITH FURY TRYING TO UNTANGLE HIMSELF FROM SOMETHING WARM AND FLEECY
THE CHUG OF THE AUTOMOBILE AS IT CLIMBED THE HILL WAS THE MOST WELCOME SOUND I HAD HEARD FOR A LONG TIME AND WITH GERTRUDE AND HALSEY ACTUALLY BEFORE ME MY TROUBLES SEEMED OVER FOR GOOD
IN THE AFTERNOON A HACK CAME UP FROM CASANOVA WITH A FRESH RELAY OF SERVANTS
IT WAS ALMOST CORRECT--NOT QUITE
ANY COURT IN THE COUNTRY WILL ACQUIT A MAN WHO KILLS AN INTRUDER IN HIS HOUSE AT NIGHT
THEY WILL PROBABLY RETURN AT ONCE HE CONCLUDED SAD PART OF MY ERRAND HERE TO-DAY IS TO SEE IF YOU WILL RELINQUISH YOUR LEASE HERE IN THEIR FAVOR WE WOULD BETTER WAIT AND SEE IF THEY WISH TO COME I SAID
SHE WORE NOTHING BUT A STOCKING ON HER RIGHT FOOT AND IN SPITE OF THE UNLOCKED DOOR SHE ESCAPED BY THE WINDOW AND AGAIN I THOUGHT OF GERTRUDE'S SPRAINED ANKLE
CHAPTER VII A SPRAINED ANKLE I WAS PANIC-STRICKEN
THE TRUTH OF MY STORY WAS SHOWN BY THE BROKEN WINDOW AND THE OVERTURNED CHAIR
IT WAS MUCH EASIER THAN I EXPECTED HOWEVER BECAUSE SHE ASKED NO QUESTIONS
HALSEY DISAPPEARED SHORTLY AFTER LOUISE LEFT AND CAME HOME ABOUT NINE THAT NIGHT MUDDY AND TIRED
FROM FAR BELOW THE SMALLEST SOUNDS CAME UP WITH PECULIAR DISTINCTNESS
I NO LONGER DEMANDED WRITTEN AND UNIMPEACHABLE REFERENCES
GERTRUDE AND ALEX--I MEAN JACK--HAD GONE FOR A WALK ALTHOUGH IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK AND ANYBODY BUT A PAIR OF YOUNG GEESE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT DEW WAS FALLING AND THAT IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RID OF A SUMMER COLD
HALSEY CAME OVER IN A FEW MINUTES AND STOOD LISTENING AND TRYING TO LOCATE THE SOUND
MR HARTON WAS THERE TOO LOOKING IMPATIENT AS THE INQUEST DRAGGED BUT ALIVE TO EVERY PARTICLE OF EVIDENCE
AT THAT TIME HOWEVER I WAS BUSY TRYING TO KEEP MY SKIRTS DRY AND PAID LITTLE OR NO ATTENTION TO WHAT SEEMED THEN A MOST TRIVIAL REMARK
I CAN'T IMAGINE FANNY ARMSTRONG IN SUCH A PLACE IT'S TRUE NEVERTHELESS
TRY TO FIND THE DRAGON FLY--IT OUGHT TO BE EASY TO TRACE
NO HE NEVER HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR CURRENT EXPENSES MR JAMIESON GOT UP THEN AND BEGAN TO PACE THE ROOM
THE GIRL WAS TOLD THAT SOMETHING OF THE KIND WAS NECESSARY THAT THE BANK WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE AND HER STEPFATHER WOULD EITHER AVOID ARREST AND DISGRACE IN THIS WAY OR KILL HIMSELF
THERE WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT IT BUT IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT A GOLF-STICK WITH A METAL END MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT THAT HAD SCRATCHED THE STAIRS NEAR THE CARD-ROOM
SHE SENT FOR ME AND AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT I WENT
IT LOOKED TO ME AS IF IT MIGHT BE SERIOUS AND I TOLD HER TO LET DOCTOR STEWART SEE IT
IRON BARS HOWEVER DO NOT FALL DOWN-STAIRS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ALONE
THREE MEN FROM THE GREENWOOD CLUB IN ALL KINDS OF COSTUMES HURRIED IN
MR JAMIESON PERSONALLY TOOK CHARGE OF THE ORGANIZED SEARCH AND EVERY EVENING NO MATTER WHERE HE HAPPENED TO BE HE CALLED US BY LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE
ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON THE LAUNDRESS SENT WORD SHE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO ME AND I SAW HER IN MY PRIVATE SITTING-ROOM A SMALL ROOM BEYOND THE DRESSING-ROOM
I SAID I WAS GLAD IT WASN'T AN ITIS OF SOME KIND ANYHOW AND HE SMILED SOLEMNLY
IT WAS ALMOST A WEEK SINCE LOUISE HAD ENCOUNTERED SOME ONE ON THE STAIRS AND IT WAS FOUR DAYS SINCE THE DISCOVERY OF THE HOLE IN THE TRUNK-ROOM WALL
IF THAT ISN'T LIKE A GIRL HE SAID
ALWAYS AWAKE AND READY TO TALK WHEN SHE WASN'T WANTED AND DOZING OFF TO SLEEP WHEN SHE WAS
UNTIL LATE THAT EVENING HALSEY AND ALEX WORKED AT THE CHUTE
IT WAS ALWAYS WE WITH THOMAS
THE DOMESTIC FORCE WAS NOW DOWN TO MARY ANNE AND LIDDY WITH THE UNDER-GARDENER'S WIFE COMING EVERY DAY TO HELP OUT
WITH THEIR MOTHER'S INHERITANCE SWEPT AWAY IN THE WRECK OF THE BANK AND WITH THEIR LOVE AFFAIRS IN A DISASTROUS CONDITION THINGS COULD SCARCELY BE WORSE
THE GREENWOOD CLUB PROMISED THE SAME THING AND AS THERE ARE NO SUNDAY AFTERNOON PAPERS THE MURDER WAS NOT PUBLICLY KNOWN UNTIL MONDAY
ARNOLD ARMSTRONG AND LOUISE HAD A LONG CONFERENCE DURING WHICH HE WAS HEARD TO STORM AND BECOME VERY VIOLENT
IN EVERY INSTANCE THEY HAD BEEN USED AS COLLATERAL FOR LARGE LOANS AND THE BELIEF WAS CURRENT THAT NOT LESS THAN A MILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS HAD BEEN REALIZED
IT WAS NOT AN UNFRIENDLY STARE
I AM VERY SORRY FOR MISS GERTRUDE
LISTEN HE SAID
I SNIFFED AND LOOKED AROUND BUT THERE WAS NO PIPE TO BE SEEN
AT THE END OF A HALF-HOUR I FOUND I HAD PUT A ROW OF BLUE SCALLOPS ON ELIZA KLINEFELTER'S LAVENDER SLIPPERS AND I PUT THEM AWAY
IT WAS MUFFLED
LIDDY HAD GOT GERTRUDE UP-STAIRS AND THE TWO STRANGE MEN FROM THE CLUB STAYED WITH THE BODY
AND SO YOU SHOWED IT TO SAM AT THE CLUB AND ASKED HIM IF HE KNEW ANY ONE WHO OWNED SUCH A LINK AND SAM SAID--WHAT WAL SAM HE LOWED HE'D SEEN SUCH A PAIR OF CUFF-BUTTONS IN A SHIRT BELONGIN TO MR BAILEY--MR JACK BAILEY SAH I'LL KEEP THIS LINK THOMAS FOR A WHILE THE DETECTIVE SAID
DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE PRACTICALLY ACCUSING GERTRUDE INNES OF ADMITTING THAT MAN NOT QUITE THAT HE SAID WITH HIS FRIENDLY SMILE
AND ON THE WAY WE DECIDED TO SAY NOTHING OF LOUISE AND HER INTERVIEW WITH HER STEPBROTHER THE NIGHT HE DIED
AND THEN I COLLAPSED
MRS WATSON HERSELF WAS A WRECK
SO GERTRUDE WAS GOING TO MEET JACK BAILEY THAT NIGHT BY THE BRIDGE
LIDDY WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE CITY AT ONCE BUT THE MILK-BOY SAID THAT THOMAS JOHNSON THE ARMSTRONGS COLORED BUTLER WAS WORKING AS A WAITER AT THE GREENWOOD CLUB AND MIGHT COME BACK
NOT FAR FROM THE WEST WING LAY THE BLACKENED RUINS OF THE STABLES
WHEN I SAW HIM THERE HE WAS COMING OUT OF THE CARD-ROOM TALKING TO MR JOHN BAILEY THE NATURE OF THE DISCUSSION--WAS IT AMICABLE HALSEY HESITATED
MISS INNES MRS FITZHUGH TELLS ME LOUISE ARMSTRONG IS WITH YOU SHE IS HAS SHE BEEN INFORMED OF THIS--DOUBLE BEREAVEMENT NOT YET I SAID
AND WHEN SHE BEGINS TO GO AROUND WITH A LUMP IN HER THROAT ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TO THREATEN TO RETURN TO SUNNYSIDE AND SHE IS FRIGHTENED INTO A SEMBLANCE OF CHEERFULNESS,--FROM WHICH YOU MAY JUDGE THAT THE SUMMER THERE WAS ANYTHING BUT A SUCCESS
AND HE WANTED TO KNOW IF WE WOULD RECOMMEND ELIZA AS A COOK
WHEN ONE HAS A PARTY I BELIEVE IT IS CUSTOMARY TO FEE THE COMPANY WHICH WILL DRINK HOT COFFEE AND KEEP AWAKE A COUPLE OF HOURS LONGER
THEN I NOTICED THAT THE WINDOWS WERE REFLECTING A FAINT PINKISH LIGHT LIDDY NOTICED IT AT THE SAME TIME AND I HEARD HER JUMP UP
HE WENT ALONE AND AT EIGHT TWENTY HE STOPPED AT DOCTOR WALKER'S
THE LODGE AT SUNNYSIDE WAS MERELY A SORT OF SUPPLEMENTARY SERVANTS QUARTERS
I WENT TO THE LODGE AND RAPPED
NOW HALSEY WAS HERE TO SPEAK FOR HIMSELF
THE WHOLE THING WAS UNHEARD OF OUTRAGEOUS AND--IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE
THE DETECTIVE HERE THINKS THAT YOU--THAT WE--KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT THE DEVIL HE DOES HALSEY'S EYES WERE FAIRLY STARTING FROM HIS HEAD
THE BRICK-PAVED ENTRY OPENED INTO A SHORT HALL TO THE RIGHT OF WHICH SEPARATED ONLY BY A ROW OF PILLARS WAS A HUGE LIVING-ROOM
AND YOU THINK LOUISE KNOWS SOMETHING HE SAID WHEN I HAD FINISHED
THE HOUSE WAS VERY LONG A RECTANGLE IN GENERAL FORM WITH THE MAIN ENTRANCE IN THE CENTER OF THE LONG SIDE
AND OTHER NIGHTS MUST FOLLOW--AND WE WERE A LONG WAY FROM A POLICE-STATION
INSTEAD OF GOING AT ONCE TO HER ROOM SHE HAD GONE BACK TO THE BILLIARD-ROOM FOR SOMETHING WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT THERE
I HAD BROUGHT ALONG TWO DOZEN PAIRS OF SLIPPER SOLES IN ASSORTED SIZES--I ALWAYS SEND KNITTED SLIPPERS TO THE OLD LADIES HOME AT CHRISTMAS--AND NOW I SORTED OVER THE WOOLS WITH A GRIM DETERMINATION NOT TO THINK ABOUT THE NIGHT BEFORE
OF COURSE I EXPECT TO DEFRAY THE EXPENSES OF THE FUNERAL BUT HIS RELATIVES MUST BE FOUND
A MAN ISN'T WELL ONE DAY AND DEAD THE NEXT WITHOUT SOME REASON I THOUGHT SHE WAS SPEAKING OF THOMAS AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS I EXCLAIMED
AFTER ALL WE HAD TO LET IT GO AT THAT BUT WE PUT IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE SUNDAY
MRS WATSON CAME TO MY BEDROOM BEFORE I WENT TO BED AND ASKED IF I HAD ANY ARNICA
AND THEN HE ROUSED TO THE EXIGENCY OF THE OCCASION
THERE HAD BEEN A SCENE AND HE LEFT ON HIS WAY TO THE STATION TO MEET AND NOTIFY MR JAMIESON OF WHAT HE HAD LEARNED
YES HE BELIEVED DEATH HAD BEEN INSTANTANEOUS
SUNNYSIDE IS FOR SALE--NO I SHALL NOT BUY IT
SHE GLANCED AT THE HEADING THEN SHE CRUMPLED THE NEWSPAPER INTO A BALL AND FLUNG IT TO THE FLOOR
THROUGH THE DOOR I COULD HEAR LIDDY GRUMBLING WITH A SQUEAL NOW AND THEN WHEN THE PAIN STABBED HARDER
IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT YOUR MIDNIGHT GUEST WAS MR ARMSTRONG OTHER THAN HIS VISIT HERE THE NEXT NIGHT YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME MISS INNES
THEN I TURNED HALSEY AROUND AND POINTED
PEOPLE DO NOT LIE READILY TO ME AND THIS MAN LIED BEYOND A DOUBT
AS FOR ME I WAS QUITE AS ASTONISHED AS SHE WAS
SEND WARNER FOR THE CAR BUT THEY DID NOT FIND HIM
DAMNATION--THERE'S NO LIGHT HERE AND THEN A SECOND LATER
MY TRUNK'S PACKED WHO PACKED IT I ASKED EXPECTING FROM HER TONE TO BE TOLD SHE HAD WAKENED TO FIND IT DONE BY SOME GHOSTLY HAND
IT WAS OVER MY HEAD AND VERY FAINT--THREE OR FOUR SHORT MUFFLED TAPS A PAUSE AND THEN AGAIN STEALTHILY REPEATED
HE WAS OUT OF BREATH FROM RUNNING AND HE LOOKED HALF ABASHED
THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT AS IF WORDS WERE SUPERFLUOUS THINGS
HOME MONDAY VERY WELL MR HARTON I WILL TELL HER BUT SHE IS NOT IN CONDITION TO WATCH FOR ANY ONE WELL MISS INNES IF YOU DECIDE TO--ER--RELINQUISH THE LEASE LET ME KNOW THE LAWYER SAID
I CAN NOT TALK UNTIL JACK TELLS ME I MAY BUT--HE IS ABSOLUTELY INNOCENT OF ALL THIS BELIEVE ME
M
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS BUT LOUISE HAD BEEN IN A STATE OF TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT
THE AUTOMOBILE WAS THERE
END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE BY MARY ROBERTS RINEHART
WHAT SHE ONLY SUSPECTED WHAT SHE REALLY KNEW WE NEVER LEARNED
I THINK HE GAVE ME UP THEN AS A POOR PROPOSITION
ISN'T IT SOMETHING THAT WE COULD ATTEND TO INSTEAD BUT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD
I HAD GROWN SO ACCUSTOMED TO SURPRISES THAT I COULD ONLY GASP AGAIN AND AS FOR GERTRUDE THE HAND THAT LAY IN MINE WAS BURNING WITH FEVER
NOTHING SEEMED TO BE DISTURBED
OR ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THAT MATTER
THEN SHE SLIPPED UPSTAIRS AND THREW THE REVOLVER OUT OF AN UPPER WINDOW GOING DOWN AGAIN IN TIME TO ADMIT THE MEN FROM THE GREENWOOD CLUB
THE DEPRESSION DUE TO MY VISIT TO THE HOSPITAL LEFT ME AT THE PROSPECT OF SEEING HALSEY AGAIN THAT NIGHT
HE SAYS HE WAS IN AN EMPTY CAR--IN THE CAR THE AUTOMOBILE STRUCK THE TRAMP BROKE IN HERE AND TOLD HIS STORY WITH FREQUENT INTERPRETATIONS BY ALEX AND MR WINTERS
HE CAME AROUND TO THE EDGE OF THE VERANDA AND STOOD LOOKING AT IT AS IF IT OUGHT TO KNOW AND EXPLAIN
FARTHER ALONG WAS THE MORE IMPOSING BURIAL-GROUND WHERE ARNOLD ARMSTRONG AND HIS FATHER LAY IN THE SHADOW OF A TALL GRANITE SHAFT
THE FUNERAL SERVICES WERE TO BE HELD ON TUESDAY AND THE INTERMENT OF THE BODY WAS TO BE DEFERRED UNTIL THE ARMSTRONGS ARRIVED FROM CALIFORNIA
SHE WON'T ALLOW WALKER IN THE ROOM AND SHE MADE ME PROMISE TO SEE YOU AND TELL YOU THIS
THE WINTER GERTRUDE CAME OUT WAS NOTHING BUT A SUCCESSION OF SITTING UP LATE AT NIGHT TO BRING HER HOME FROM THINGS TAKING HER TO THE DRESSMAKERS BETWEEN NAPS THE NEXT DAY AND DISCOURAGING INELIGIBLE YOUTHS WITH EITHER MORE MONEY THAN BRAINS OR MORE BRAINS THAN MONEY
SHE SAYS THERE NEVER WAS A GHOST KNOWN HERE I GLARED AT HER SPEECHLESS AND CLOSING THE DOOR INTO LOUISE'S BOUDOIR TO LIDDY'S GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT I WENT ON TO THE BEDROOM BEYOND
NOT A WORD SHE SAID BEYOND ASKING HER A QUESTION OR TWO WHICH THERE WAS NO HARM IN
IT WAS NOT MY IDEA OF COMFORT BEING MUCH TOO LARGE AND SUFFICIENTLY ISOLATED TO MAKE THE SERVANT QUESTION SERIOUS
LIDDY WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE KITCHEN HOLDING A FRYING-PAN BY THE HANDLE AS A WEAPON
YALE LOCK HE SAID
SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HIGH-SPIRITED WITH THE WELL-POISED HEAD AND BUOYANT STEP OF THE OUTDOORS GIRL
HE WAS LIKE HIS FATHER JUST THEN
EVERY INSTANT IS PRECIOUS
I THINK HE WAS UNCERTAIN AS TO MY CONNECTION WITH THE ARMSTRONG FAMILY AND DUBIOUS WHETHER I CONSIDERED MR ARMSTRONG'S TAKING AWAY A MATTER FOR CONDOLENCE OR CONGRATULATION
FOR TWO YEARS HE HAD LIVED IN TOWN THEN IT WOULD BE UNLIKELY THAT HE CAME HERE LAST NIGHT TO GET POSSESSION OF ANYTHING BELONGING TO HIM I SHOULD THINK IT HARDLY POSSIBLE HE ADMITTED
EVERYTHING BUT MY DOMESTIC AFFAIRS IS AT YOUR SERVICE TRY TO BE SERIOUS I SAID
THE SOUND OF MR WINTERS BREATHING WAS COMFORTING
ANOTHER DECISION I MADE AND I PUT IT INTO EXECUTION IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST
I TAKE IT CASANOVA HAS FEW FIRES AND SUNNYSIDE WAS FURNISHING THE PEOPLE IN ONE WAY AND ANOTHER THE GREATEST EXCITEMENT THEY HAD HAD FOR YEARS
SHE DIED THAT NIGHT
MRS ARMSTRONG HAS WIRED ME AGAIN I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE IT UP I MAINTAINED UNTIL I UNDERSTAND SOME THINGS THAT ARE PUZZLING ME
GERTRUDE HAD BEEN SITTING LISTLESSLY WAITING FOR THE EVENING MESSAGE FROM MR JAMIESON BUT WHEN THE SINGULAR PAIR CAME IN AS THEY DID WITHOUT CEREMONY SHE JUMPED UP AND STOOD STARING
WHY HAD LOUISE LEFT HER PEOPLE AND COME HOME TO HIDE AT THE LODGE
I GOT UP AND DRESSED HASTILY AND THE DETECTIVE WAS SHOWN UP TO MY SITTING-ROOM
SHE WOULD NOT BE JUDGED BY EARTHLY LAWS
THE WOMEN WERE CURIOUS AND LEAVING THE FENCE THEY WENT BACK AND BY A ROUNDABOUT PATH DOWN TO THE ROAD
ONCE MY STRAINING EARS SEEMED TO CATCH A FOOTFALL BENEATH ME POSSIBLY IN MY OWN ROOM
I SAT DOWN IN THE STIFF-BACKED CHAIR AND TRIED TO REMEMBER HOW MANY DAYS ONE COULD LIVE WITHOUT FOOD AND WATER
IF YOU WILL COME OVER I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN
IN THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED LIDDY STIRRED AND SNORED AGAIN
ANNE TOOK THE CHILD AND NAMED HIM LUCIEN
ANYHOW I'M GOING TO THE LODGE TO INVESTIGATE GERTRUDE WANTED TO GO TOO BUT SHE LOOKED SO SHAKEN THAT I INSISTED SHE SHOULD NOT
HE LOOKED QUEER AND I TRIED TO GET HIM INSIDE BUT HE WOULDN'T MOVE
THE BANK EXAMINERS WERE WORKING ON THE BOOKS AND SAID NOTHING FOR PUBLICATION
AT INTERVALS I WENT TO THE DOOR INTO THE HALL AND LOOKED OUT BUT I SAW AND HEARD NOTHING SUSPICIOUS
THE LODGE BOASTED THREE BEDROOMS UP-STAIRS ALL COMFORTABLY FURNISHED
WHO IS IT I ASKED WITH DIFFICULTY
WHAT SORT OF A LOOKING CHAP IS THAT WALKER GERTRUDE HE ASKED
LOUISE WILL SEND FOR HALSEY NOW AND THEY WILL MAKE IT ALL UP FOR LOUISE HAD STEADILY REFUSED TO SEE HALSEY ALL THAT DAY AND THE BOY WAS FRANTIC
LIDDY HAD GONE TO THE VILLAGE TO MARKET IT BEING HER FIRM BELIEF THAT THE STORE PEOPLE SENT SHORT MEASURE UNLESS SHE WATCHED THE SCALES AND THAT SINCE THE FAILURE OF THE TRADERS BANK WE MUST WATCH THE CORNERS
AND THEN I SEEN THE PLASTER DROP DROPPIN FROM A LITTLE HOLE IN THE WALL
FEEL THEM
PERHAPS I WENT A LITTLE FASTER PAST THE YAWNING BLACKNESS OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
SHE CAN'T SWEAR IT HE SAID FINALLY
THE TWELVE FEET LOOKED SHORT FROM BELOW BUT THEY WERE DIFFICULT TO CLIMB
OH HALSEY HOW I HAVE WANTED TO SEE YOU THERE WAS SOMETHING I DID NOT HEAR THEN HALSEY AGAIN
MY ORDERS ARE POSITIVE AT THAT MOMENT A HEAVY STEP SOUNDED ON THE STAIRS
HE STOPPED GLANCED AT ROSIE AND AT ME AND THEN HIS EYES FELL ON THE RESTLESS HEAD ON THE PILLOW
WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED HE TOOK ME BY THE ELBOW AND PULLED ME IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR
HE KNEW WHERE THEY HAD BEEN FOR THE LAST FORTY-EIGHT HOURS AND WHY JACK BAILEY HAD NOT RETURNED WITH HIM
THE DOOR SEEMED MOST PROBABLE AND I HOPED IT HAD BEEN SO
DON'T ALLOW ANY ONE IN THE HOUSE THAT YOU DON'T TRUST AND DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
I WONDERED WHAT GERTRUDE'S ABSENCE FROM HER ROOM HAD TO DO WITH IT ALL OR IF IT HAD ANY CONNECTION
OH HALSEY WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN LET ME TAKE YOU UP TO THE HOUSE HE WAS IN THE ROAD AND HAD BEULAH AND THE BASKET OUT OF MY ARMS IN A MOMENT
I COULD HARDLY SIT STILL
TUESDAY MORNING THE DETECTIVE MADE A CAREFUL SEARCH OF THE GROUNDS BUT HE FOUND NOTHING
HE CAME UP EARLY THE NEXT MORNING JUST AS WE FINISHED BREAKFAST IN A PROFESSIONAL LOOKING CAR WITH A BLACK HOOD
I HAD MY FINGER ON THE TRIGGER OF THE REVOLVER AND AS I JUMPED IT WENT OFF RIGHT THROUGH THE DOOR
SOMEBODY WILL WALK LAME HALSEY SAID WHEN HE HAD MARKED THE COURSE OF THE BULLET
BUT WHERE HAD ROSIE CARRIED HER BASKET
CHAPTER XXXI BETWEEN TWO FIREPLACES WHAT WITH THE EXCITEMENT OF THE DISCOVERY THE WALK HOME UNDER THE STARS IN WET SHOES AND DRAGGLED SKIRTS AND GETTING UP-STAIRS AND UNDRESSED WITHOUT ROUSING LIDDY I WAS COMPLETELY USED UP
HOW OFTEN THE SINS OF THE FATHERS ARE VISITED ON THE CHILDREN WHICH LEFT ME PONDERING
WARNER PROBABLY HE SAID WHEN I HAD FINISHED
MY OIL LAMP WAS FULL OF OIL BUT IT KEP GOIN OUT DO WHAT I WOULD
THE LITTLE FELLOW WAS ILL
THAT ISN'T ALL GERTRUDE HE SAID QUIETLY
THE RESULT WAS NIL
AND IN THE MEANTIME CONSUMED WITH ANXIETY AS WE WERE THINGS WERE HAPPENING AT THE HOUSE IN RAPID SUCCESSION
THEN AFTER A BREAKFAST WHICH DID MORE CREDIT TO THOMAS HEART THAN HIS HEAD I WENT ON A SHORT TOUR OF INVESTIGATION
WHEN THEY HAD GONE HE CRAWLED INTO THE BOX-CAR AND CLOSED THE DOOR AGAIN
BUT HE SAID HER GETTING OUT NEAR THE GATE PUZZLED HIM
AFFAIRS AT THE TRADERS BANK WERE PROGRESSING SLOWLY
I SHALL NOT RELINQUISH IT I REPLIED AND I IMAGINED HIS IRRITATION FROM THE WAY HE HUNG UP THE RECEIVER
BOTH SHE AND HER MOTHER ARE GHOSTS OF THEIR FORMER SELVES
MONEY HAD BEEN SPENT LAVISHLY ON CONSTRUCTION AND PLUMBING
MRS WATSON I SAID SEVERELY WILL YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO EXPLAIN THIS RATHER UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE I DON'T THINK IT SO UNUSUAL MISS INNES HER VOICE WAS DEEP AND VERY CLEAR
COME MISS INNES YOU'RE A GHOST OF YOURSELF AND I AM GOING TO HELP YOU UP-STAIRS AND CALL YOUR MAID
HE HAD DRESSED HASTILY GATHERED UP SOME INSTRUMENTS AND DRIVEN TO SUNNYSIDE
OH MISS RACHEL DON'T AS I TRIED TO GET PAST HER
GERTRUDE I LEARNED HAD WATCHED ALL NIGHT BESIDE ME IN AN EXTREMITY OF ANXIETY ABOUT ME
FROM WHERE I STOOD I COULD NOT SEE BEYOND THE DOOR BUT I SAW MR JAMIESON'S FACE CHANGE AND HEARD HIM MUTTER SOMETHING THEN HE BOLTED DOWN THE STAIRS THREE AT A TIME
THE MAN WHO LAY BEFORE US WAS NOT PAUL ARMSTRONG
SHE'S NOT HERE SHE SAID
PERHAPS A HUNDRED FEET TO THE LEFT THE PATH LED ACROSS THE VALLEY TO THE COUNTRY CLUB AND ONLY A LITTLE WAY OFF WAS THE FOOT-BRIDGE OVER CASANOVA CREEK
ANNE HAD BEEN FOND OF LOUISE--SHE REMINDED HER OF LUCY
WHAT WOULD I FIND IF I DID GET IN
POOR LOYAL LITTLE GIRL
MISS INNES ALEX BEGAN ABRUPTLY THIS MAN CAN TELL US SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MR INNES
ALSO YOU FORGET THAT BOTH MEN HAVE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO MISS GERTRUDE
WE SPOKE LOW AND REVERENTLY IN THE PRESENCE OF DEATH AND WE TACITLY AVOIDED ANY MENTION OF THE SUSPICION THAT WAS IN EVERY MIND
SHE HAD ASKED FOR ARNOLD AND WAS TOLD HE HAD LEFT TOWN
WHERE'S THE GARDENER THESE DAYS THERE ISN'T ANY I SAID MEEKLY
LATER ON I HEARD A CRASH FROM THE PANTRY AND LIDDY REPORTED THAT BEULAH WHO IS COAL BLACK HAD DARTED IN FRONT OF THOMAS JUST AS HE PICKED UP A TRAY OF DISHES
I FELT VERY QUEER AND SHAKY
IT IS A CLOSET I THINK WE WERE IN THE UPPER HALL NOW
LIDDY STILL CLINGS TO HER GHOST THEORY AND POINTS TO MY WET AND MUDDY BOOTS IN THE TRUNK-ROOM AS PROOF
AND THEN HE STOOPED AND BEGAN PUNCHING AROUND THE KEYHOLE WITH THE END OF A LEAD-PENCIL
YOU GIVE ME THE CREEPS STANDING THERE
THE DOOR INTO GERTRUDE'S ROOM WAS NO LONGER LOCKED
THE MESSAGE WAS FROM A MR JARVIS WHO ASKED HIM TO COME AT ONCE TO SUNNYSIDE AS THERE HAD BEEN AN ACCIDENT THERE AND MR ARNOLD ARMSTRONG HAD BEEN SHOT
OH MISS INNES IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE MAN THAT KILLED THAT MR ARMSTRONG DON'T BE FOOLISH I SAID
HE LOOKED GRAVE AND ANXIOUS AND HE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION WITH GERTRUDE LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
AND THEN I HEARD A LOW EXCLAMATION FROM THE DETECTIVE AND I FELT THE PRESSURE OF THE DOCTOR'S FINGERS ON MY ARM
WHY WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING UP AT THE BIG HOUSE MISS INNES SOME ONE TRIED TO ENTER THE HOUSE DURING THE FIRE AND WAS SHOT AND SLIGHTLY INJURED I SAID HASTILY
HE WAS A PLEASANT-FACED YOUNG FELLOW WITH BLACK HAIR AND BLUE EYES AND HIS NAME WAS ALEXANDER GRAHAM
HERE WAS I RACHEL INNES SPINSTER A GRANDDAUGHTER OF OLD JOHN INNES OF REVOLUTIONARY DAYS A D
NOTHING TO-DAY
RUMORS THAT I HAD HEARD ABOUT THE CLUB CAME BACK--OF DRINKING OF HIGH PLAY AND ONCE A YEAR AGO OF A SUICIDE UNDER THOSE VERY LIGHTS
AS WE STROLLED BACK AND FORTH ALONG THE DRIVE MR JAMIESON EMERGED FROM THE SHADOW OF THE TREES
THAT HIS FATHER WAS RESPONSIBLE
ROSIE STARTED TO RUN AND I TRIED TO STOP HER AND TELL HER SOME SORT OF A STORY TO ACCOUNT FOR MY BEING THERE
RIGGS SAID THE PLANS WERE DRAWN FOR THE HOUSE HE SAID HARKING BACK TO THE OLD SUBJECT
FROM THE DOCTOR'S IT SEEMS MR INNES WALKED ACROSS THE LAWN TO THE COTTAGE MRS ARMSTRONG AND HER DAUGHTER HAVE TAKEN
THE LITTLE STORM HAD CLEARED THE AIR
HALSEY IF THE WORST COMES IF THEY SHOULD ARREST YOU YOU MUST--TELL I SHALL TELL NOTHING HE SAID WITH A NEW STERNNESS IN HIS VOICE
SHE WAS LEANING AGAINST THE DOOR FOR WHEN I OPENED IT SHE FELL IN
I HAD NO INTENTION OF EAVESDROPPING BUT I WANTED TO BE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS JACK BAILEY SHE WAS MEETING
MATTHEW GEIST THE DRIVER ASKED FOR ME AND EXPLAINED HIS ERRAND WITH PRIDE
DID LOUISE AND HER MOTHER KNOW OF THE SHAMEFUL AND WICKED DECEPTION
IT WAS BAILEY WHO GOT ARNOLD INTO TROUBLE LAST SPRING--SOMETHING ABOUT THE BANK
HE HAD A SCRAP OF PAPER THAT INDICATED A CONCEALED ROOM SOMEWHERE
CHAPTER XXVII WHO IS NINA CARRINGTON
MAKE ME BELIEVE IT HALSEY HALSEY SOOTHED HER AS BEST HE COULD AND THE BREACH SEEMED HEALED
L
L
AND THE MAN IN THE ROOM WITH ME LEANED AGAINST THE MANTEL-DOOR AND LISTENED
I HAVE BEEN ALMOST WILD SWEETHEART,"--HALSEY'S VOICE
THE RECEPTION-ROOM WAS EMPTY BUT FROM THE CONSULTING-ROOM BEYOND CAME THE SOUND OF TWO VOICES NOT VERY AMICABLE
SHE SAT IN HER BIG PILLOW-FILLED CHAIR AND HEARD ME THROUGH WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
I TOLD HIM THAT WE WERE ON THE TRACK LAST NIGHT AND THAT IT WAS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME
THE PANTRY WAS SUDDENLY FILLED WITH THE ODOR OF SINGEING CLOTH
THOUGHTS THAT INSISTED ON OBTRUDING THEMSELVES I PUSHED RESOLUTELY TO THE BACK OF MY MIND AND I SYSTEMATICALLY RELAXED EVERY MUSCLE
THE BULLET WAS FIRED AT CLOSE RANGE ENTERED BELOW THE SHOULDER AND CAME OUT AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE HEART WELL DOWN THE BACK
THE BED HAD NOT BEEN OCCUPIED
MR TRAUTMAN HOWEVER WAS A SHREWD BUSINESS MAN AND HE DID NOT LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS
LOUISE HERSELF MUST NOTIFY HER PEOPLE
WE STOOD HUDDLED TOGETHER AT THE HEAD OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE LOOKING DOWN INTO ITS SHADOWS
AND I SAW MR JAMIESON'S EYEBROWS GO UP
FOR THREE STEPS THE SCRATCH WAS REPEATED GRADUALLY DIMINISHING AS IF SOME OBJECT HAD FALLEN STRIKING EACH ONE
I WAS UP AT ONCE AND WITH THE SOUND OF MY FOOTSTEP ON THE FLOOR THE LOW KNOCKING CEASED TO BE FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY SIBILANT WHISPERING THROUGH THE KEYHOLE
HE WAS TREMBLING SO THAT HE COULDN'T STAND WHEN I LEFT JAMIESON AND HALSEY TOGETHER MADE THE ROUND OF THE LODGE OCCASIONALLY CALLING THE OLD MAN BY NAME
I COULD HEAR THOMAS GOING UP THE STAIRS COULD HEAR HIM ROUSE WARNER AND THE STEPS OF THE CHAUFFEUR AS HE HURRIEDLY DRESSED
I WANTED TO LAUGH AND CRY IN THE SAME BREATH--TO CRAWL INTO BED AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA AND SCOLD LIDDY AND DO ANY OF THE THOUSAND NATURAL THINGS THAT I HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO DO AGAIN
GERTRUDE'S ROOMS AT HOME WERE ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL APARTMENTS BUT THE THREE ROOMS IN THE EAST WING AT SUNNYSIDE SET APART FOR THE DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE WERE MUCH MORE SPLENDID
SOMEHOW ALL THE TIME HE WAS DOING IT I HAD A VISION OF DOCTOR WILLOUGHBY MY NERVE SPECIALIST IN THE CITY TRYING TO MAKE AN EGG-NOG
JUST AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS I STUBBED MY TOE AGAINST HALSEY'S BIG CHAIR AND HAD TO STAND ON ONE FOOT IN A SOUNDLESS AGONY UNTIL THE PAIN SUBSIDED TO A DULL ACHE
THE PLACE LOOKS ALL RIGHT AND I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT SUCH THINGS
RUN BACK TO MR HALSEY'S ROOM AND GET HIS REVOLVER
NO NEWS I ASKED AS HE ENTERED
THE HOUSE HAD BEEN LOCKED IN THE MORNING AND APPARENTLY UNDISTURBED
IF YOU DON'T READ AND ACT ON THIS I SHALL GIVE IT TO THAT JAMIESON AND I'LL VENTURE HE'LL NOT GO BACK TO THE CITY TO-DAY THAT DECIDED ME
WELL THE MAN WAS GONE
SOME HEAVY BODY DROPPED AND HALF CRAZED WITH TERROR AND SHOCK I RAN THROUGH THE DRAWING-ROOM AND GOT UP-STAIRS--I SCARCELY REMEMBER HOW SHE DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AND I THOUGHT MR JAMIESON MUST HAVE FINISHED
IT WAS HEART DISEASE I THINK
THEN WE'VE GOT THEM HE SAID
AT SIX O'CLOCK THE BODY WAS TAKEN AWAY AND AT SEVEN-THIRTY AFTER AN EARLY DINNER MR HARTON WENT
THE SPACE BETWEEN THE BRICK WALL AND THE PLASTER AND LATH ONE HOWEVER HAD A NEW SIGNIFICANCE
HE WAS GOING EAST AFTER SPENDING THE SUMMER AT A CELEBRATED RANCH IN WYOMING--ONE OF THOSE PLACES WHERE WEALTHY MEN SEND WORTHLESS AND DISSIPATED SONS FOR A SEASON OF TEMPERANCE FRESH AIR AND HUNTING
AUNT RAY HE CALLED SHARPLY
DO YOU SUPPOSE HE THINKS ANY ONE IN THIS HOUSE IS GOING TO PLAY BRIDGE TO-NIGHT AT NINE O'CLOCK BY APPOINTMENT
I RAN FULL INTO A MAN IN A LONG COAT WHO WAS STANDING IN THE SHADOW BESIDE THE DRIVE WITH HIS BACK TO ME WATCHING THE LIGHTED WINDOWS
THE NOTE LIDDY HAD FOUND IN GERTRUDE'S SCRAP-BASKET WAS FROM HIM AND IT WAS HE WHO HAD STARTLED ME INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY THE CLOTHES CHUTE AND WITH GERTRUDE'S HELP HAD CARRIED ME TO LOUISE'S ROOM
I SAT ON A TRUNK WAITING TO HEAR LIDDY FLY UP THE STAIRS WITH THE HOUSEHOLD BEHIND HER LIKE THE TAIL OF A COMET
IT SEEMS UNLIKELY AND MY TOWN HOUSE IS BEING REMODELED AT THAT HE LET THE MATTER DROP BUT IT CAME UP UNPLEASANTLY ENOUGH LATER
LOUISE--DON'T TELL ME IT ISN'T GOING TO BE
HALSEY WAS TALKING QUIETLY AND MRS WATSON WAS LOOKING DOWN AND LISTENING
JACK BAILEY HASN'T A PENNY THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO HIM
AND UP TO TWO MONTHS AGO WHEN SHE AND HER MOTHER WENT WEST I WAS THE HAPPIEST FELLOW ON EARTH
THE ODDEST THING TO ME WAS THAT MR JAMIESON HAD KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT ALEX WAS JACK BAILEY
HE HAS FAR TOO FINE CLOTHES FOR THE COUNTRY THERE WAS A CHORUS OF SHOUTS AND SHRILL YELLS FROM THE FRONT DOOR FOLLOWED BY THE LOUD STAMPING OF CHILDREN'S FEET AND A THROATY WHOA WHOA INTO THE ROOM CAME A TANDEM TEAM OF TWO CHUBBY YOUNGSTERS A BOY AND A GIRL HARNESSED WITH A CLOTHES-LINE AND DRIVEN BY A LAUGHING BOY OF ABOUT SEVEN IN TAN OVERALLS AND BRASS BUTTONS
FRIGHT AND A WEAK HEART TOGETHER BUT WHAT COULD HAVE DONE IT GERTRUDE ASKED
THE DOOR INTO THE CLOTHES CHUTE WAS SECURELY BOLTED AND WHEN I OPENED IT I SAW THE EVIDENCE OF THE WOMAN'S STORY
BUT AS LONG AS I LEARN ONLY PARTS OF THE TRUTH FROM BOTH YOU AND HER WHAT CAN I DO
THE NIGHT THAT FOLLOWED WAS QUIET ENOUGH
AND SO IN THE END I TOOK HER
WHY WHAT COULD IT BE BUT FLIGHT
YES SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A SIMILAR MANTEL AND FIREPLACE THERE SIMILARLY CLOSED
HE WAS COMPLETELY BUT SOMEWHAT INCONGRUOUSLY DRESSED AND HIS OPEN BOYISH FACE LOOKED ABASHED
IF THIS DETECTIVE COULD PROVE THAT GERTRUDE FEARED AND DISLIKED THE MURDERED MAN AND THAT MR ARMSTRONG HAD BEEN ANNOYING AND POSSIBLY PURSUING HER WITH HATEFUL ATTENTIONS ALL THAT ADDED TO GERTRUDE'S CONFESSION OF HER PRESENCE IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME LOOKED STRANGE TO SAY THE LEAST
MR ARMSTRONG LEFT THE CLUB OSTENSIBLY FOR A MOONLIGHT SAUNTER ABOUT HALF AFTER ELEVEN O'CLOCK
NINA CARRINGTON'S OWN STORY DIED WITH HER BUT HOWEVER IT HAPPENED IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE HAD CARRIED HER KNOWLEDGE TO HALSEY THE AFTERNOON GERTRUDE AND I WERE LOOKING FOR CLUES TO THE MAN I HAD SHOT ON THE EAST VERANDA
WHEN HE HAD TAKEN A FORMAL FAREWELL I WAS CONFIDENT OF ONE THING
I AM TOO WEAK TO STRUGGLE TO-DAY
THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE BY MARY ROBERTS RINEHART CONTENTS I I TAKE A COUNTRY HOUSE II A LINK CUFF-BUTTON III MR
MARY ANNE AND ELIZA LEFT THAT AFTERNOON BUT ROSIE DECIDED TO STAY
I SAID NOTHING TO HER HOWEVER OF THE DETECTIVE'S SUSPICIONS ABOUT ALEX
ALONG SOMEWHERE IN THE DARK STRETCH BETWEEN CAROL STREET AND THE DEPOT HE EVIDENTLY SWERVED SUDDENLY--PERHAPS SOME ONE IN THE ROAD--AND WENT FULL INTO THE SIDE OF A FREIGHT
HE HAS GONE TO THE STATION FOR MR JAMIESON
AS FOR THE HOUSE IT'S BIG ENOUGH FOR A HOSPITAL IF IT HAS A QUEEN ANNE FRONT AND A MARY ANNE BACK WHICH WAS RIDICULOUS
BUT IT WAS ONLY IDLE SPECULATION
IT'S A FIELD
IT'S A HASH THAT'S WHAT IT IS
AND I'M SURE DOCTOR BOYLE'S BEEN TRYING TO TAKE IT OUT FOR YEARS THERE WAS NO LAUDANUM AND LIDDY MADE A TERRIBLE FUSS WHEN I PROPOSED CARBOLIC ACID JUST BECAUSE I HAD PUT TOO MUCH ON THE COTTON ONCE AND BURNED HER MOUTH
WHY I THOUGHT I SAW THOMAS OUT THERE AS YOU MADE THAT CYCLONIC BREAK OUT OF THE DOOR AND OVER THE PORCH I COULD SEE THAT UNDER PRETENSE OF EXAMINING HIS INJURY HE WAS WATCHING HER THROUGH THE MIRROR
MOREOVER A MINUTE OR TWO IN THE DARKNESS ENABLED ME TO SEE THINGS FAIRLY WELL
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN ENOUGH TO LEAVE THEM
AND BESIDE HER ON THE TABLE WAS MOST OF THE KITCHEN PARAPHERNALIA
I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY HE SAID WITH OLD-FASHIONED COURTESY
WHY DID HE DO IT SHE WAILED
SHE CAME FORWARD TO MEET ME AND I NOTICED THAT SOME OF THE ANXIOUS LINES HAD GONE OUT OF HER FACE
I AM VERY SORRY YOU HAVE MADE THIS DECISION HE SAID
ONE HAND HAD BEEN BADLY CUT AND IT WAS THAT POISONING HAVING SET IN WHICH WAS KILLING HER
THE DOOR OPENED AND I WAS ABOUT TO ASK WHAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THERE WAS A FLASH AND A REPORT
I COULDN'T HEAR BUT HIS VOICE WAS STRANGE
HALSEY I ASKED UNCEREMONIOUSLY IGNORING THE STRANGER
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE HE YELLED
HE'S SITTING DOWN THERE ON THE EDGE OF THE PORCH AND HE SAYS HE HAS SEEN A GHOST
AS TO WHY YOU WILL LEARN THAT SOON ENOUGH
SO I NATURALLY BELIEVED HIM WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME DOWN I WAS READY WITH A QUESTION
THE BED WAS TURNED DOWN AND HER DRESSING-GOWN AND NIGHT-DRESS LAY READY IN THE LITTLE ROOM NEXT BUT GERTRUDE WAS NOT THERE
IF SAM SAW ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS OUTSIDE HE WAS TO TAP AT THE EAST ENTRY WHERE ALEX AND HALSEY WERE TO ALTERNATE IN KEEPING WATCH THROUGH THE NIGHT
FOR SOME REASON THE ARCHITECT IN BUILDING THE HOUSE HAD LEFT A SPACE THERE THAT STRUCK ME EVEN IN THE SURPRISE OF THE DISCOVERY AS AN EXCELLENT PLACE FOR A CONFLAGRATION TO GAIN HEADWAY
IT SEEMS THE MAN WAS GRATEFUL FOR HIS RELEASE AND WHEN HE LEARNED SOME THING OF HALSEY'S WHEREABOUTS FROM ANOTHER MEMBER OF HIS FRATERNITY--FOR IT IS A FRATERNITY--HE WAS PROMPT IN LETTING US KNOW
HE WAS VERY GRAVE AND HIS CUSTOMARY GENIALITY WAS TINGED WITH RESTRAINT
MR WINTERS AND ALEX DISPOSED OF THE TRAMP WITH A WARNING
HE OFFERED UP EVERYTHING TO HIS GOLDEN CALF
I AM GOING TO PUT THIS IN MR HALSEY'S ROOM MISS INNES HE SAID AND I SHALL SEND ONE OF THE DETECTIVES TO GUARD IT I HARDLY HEARD HIM
I--I DID NOT LEAVE THE BILLIARD-ROOM AT ONCE WHY THE DETECTIVE'S TONE WAS IMPERATIVE
I WAS PERHAPS EIGHT OR TEN FEET AWAY--AND THEN HE THREW THE BOLT BACK
AND I COULD CHEERFULLY HAVE CHOKED ALEX TO DEATH FOR HIS AUDACITY
I CALLED HER ONCE OR TWICE THE ONLY RESULT BEING AN EXPLOSIVE SNORE THAT THREATENED HER VERY WINDPIPE--THEN I GOT UP AND LIGHTED A BEDROOM CANDLE
GERTRUDE AND HALSEY WENT FOR A LONG WALK THAT AFTERNOON AND LOUISE SLEPT
HE DID SO FINALLY AND WAS AMAZED AT BEING CONFRONTED BY LOUISE ARMSTRONG
THIS INSTANT I ORDERED AS HE HESITATED
THE CORONER HIMSELF NOTIFIED THE ARMSTRONG FAMILY LAWYER AND EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON HE CAME OUT
AFTER A TIME HE GOT THE GENERAL MANAGER AND THEY TALKED FOR SOME TIME
THE SOUND SEEMED TO COME FROM JUST OUTSIDE MY DOOR
AND THEN GERTRUDE CAME IN ANNOUNCING A MAN BELOW TO SEE MR JAMIESON
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF AN ENTRANCE--NO LEVERS NO HINGES TO GIVE A HINT
THOMAS QUAILED
THEN I SAW SOMETHING GLEAMING WHICH PROVED TO BE THE HANDLE OF A CUP AND A STEP OR TWO FARTHER ON I FOUND A V-SHAPED BIT OF A PLATE
WHEN HE SAW ME HE GOT UP
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THE MURDERED MAN WHO HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT WHO HAD IT BEEN
HER PROSTRATION EVER SINCE HER--AUNT RAY YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS GERTRUDE WHO FELL DOWN THE CLOTHES CHUTE I COULD ONLY NOD MY HEAD IN A HOPELESS AFFIRMATIVE
THEY LEFT BY THE LOWER ROAD WHICH PREVENTED THEM BEING HEARD AND WHEN YOU AND MISS GERTRUDE GOT DOWN-STAIRS EVERYTHING WAS QUIET BUT--GERTRUDE'S STORY I STAMMERED
ABOVE ON THE HILL ACROSS THE VALLEY WERE THE LIGHTS OF THE GREENWOOD CLUB
PROMPTED BY JEALOUS INSANE FURY ARMSTRONG FOLLOWED COMING ACROSS BY THE PATH
GOOD CHEERFULLY
IN THIS ONE THE LARGEST AND AIRIEST A NIGHT LAMP WAS BURNING AND BY ITS LIGHT I COULD MAKE OUT A PLAIN WHITE METAL BED
NOW HE STEPPED OUT ON THE PORCH AND CLOSED THE DOOR GENTLY BEHIND HIM
I WISH MERELY TO ASK YOU A QUESTION WON'T YOU SIT DOWN IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY
HALSEY BELOW YELLED AT ME
THOMAS JOHNSON CAME AMBLING UP THE DRIVE ABOUT HALF-PAST SIX AND WE COULD HEAR HIM CLATTERING AROUND ON THE LOWER FLOOR OPENING SHUTTERS
WHY HOW ARE YOU RACHEL SAM SAID SONOROUSLY
THE PAPERS WERE IN HER TRUNK AT SUNNYSIDE WITH LETTERS FROM THE DEAD MAN THAT WOULD PROVE WHAT SHE SAID
IT WAS ROSIE--ROSIE IN A STATE OF COLLAPSE FROM TERROR AND NOT THE LEAST IMPORTANT CLUTCHING ONE OF MY COALPORT PLATES AND A SILVER SPOON
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HALSEY I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE YOU LOUISE ONLY RAISED HER HANDS DESPAIRINGLY AND DROPPED THEM AGAIN
LET ME STAY IN YOUR DRESSING-ROOM MISS RACHEL SHE BEGGED
HE IS ALWAYS A BOY--AND I AM AN OLD WOMAN
MONDAY OR TUESDAY AT THE LATEST WOULD FIND DOCTOR WALKER BACK IN HIS GREEN AND WHITE HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE AND LOUISE'S ATTITUDE TO HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE WOULD SIGNIFY HALSEY'S HAPPINESS OR WRETCHEDNESS AS IT MIGHT TURN OUT
THEN SHE HAD LOCKED THE DOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND TAKING A LAMP HAD ACCOMPANIED MR BAILEY TO THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE HOUSE AND HAD WATCHED HIM CROSS THE LAWN
THERE WAS AN UNEASY MOVEMENT AND A GRUNT FROM THE FOOT OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE AND SILENCE AGAIN
WHILE I WAS DRESSING FOR DINNER LIDDY RAPPED AT THE DOOR
THERE'S A LADDER UP THE CLOTHES CHUTE MISS INNES SHE SAID
THE SOUNDS HAD COME FROM THE EAST WING AND NOT WITHOUT SOME QUALMS I BEGAN THERE
MARKED AS SHE WAS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO FOLLOW HER BUT SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND
NOTHING SEEMED TO ESCAPE HIM
HOW BADLY HE WAS HURT HOW FAR HE HAD BEEN CARRIED WERE THE QUESTIONS THAT DEMANDED IMMEDIATE ANSWER
SOME OF THE SERVANTS HAVE BEEN AMUSING THEMSELVES I WAS FAR FROM CONVINCED
BARBARA FITZHUGH FLOUNCED OUT WITHOUT WAITING TO SPEAK TO ME BUT MR HARTON CAME UP AS I KNEW HE WOULD
CHAPTER XXX WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN IT WAS ON WEDNESDAY RIGGS TOLD US THE STORY OF HIS CONNECTION WITH SOME INCIDENTS THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY UNEXPLAINED
NO SHE DID NOT KNOW OF EITHER OF THE DEATHS IN THE FAMILY
BUT I WOULD NOT THINK MUCH OF THAT MISS INNES
HOWEVER I DID THE BEST I COULD
A SMALL TOWN IN THE WEST AN ATTACK OF HEART DISEASE A BODY FROM A MEDICAL COLLEGE DISSECTING-ROOM SHIPPED IN A TRUNK TO DOCTOR WALKER BY A COLLEAGUE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND PALMED OFF FOR THE SUPPOSED DEAD BANKER
THERE IS THE WHISTLE OF THE TRAIN NOW SHE RELAXED A LITTLE AT OUR MATTER-OF-FACT TONE AND ALLOWED HERSELF TO SINK INTO A CHAIR
I OPENED THE BOX AND FELT AROUND FOR IT
LOUISE TOLD ME HER MOTHER DESPISED THE PLACE
HIS INHERITED CUPIDITY WAS AROUSED
HALSEY TRIED TO LOOSEN MY FINGERS BUT I WAS IN A PARALYSIS OF FRIGHT
AS LIDDY AND I WENT FROM ONE WINDOW TO ANOTHER OUR VOICES ECHOED BACK AT US UNCOMFORTABLY
THE OLD MAN KNOWS MORE THAN HE IS WILLING TO ADMIT I SUGGESTED THAT ALEX THE GARDENER WOULD PROBABLY BE WILLING TO HELP AND MR JAMIESON UNDERTOOK TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENT
I KNEW ONE ONCE MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO WHO WAS LIKE THAT
THERE WAS NOT A CORNER APPARENTLY THAT WAS NOT OPEN AND ABOVE-BOARD AND YET SOMEWHERE BEHIND ITS HANDSOMELY PAPERED WALLS I BELIEVED FIRMLY THAT THERE LAY A HIDDEN ROOM WITH ALL THE POSSIBILITIES IT WOULD INVOLVE
HE WAS USED UP PRETTY BAD BUT HE WEREN'T DEAD
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE TELEPHONE RANG
HALSEY KISSED HER TENDERLY AND I NOTICED EVIDENCES OF STRAIN AND ANXIETY IN BOTH YOUNG FACES
HIS PIPE STILL WARM RESTED ON THE EDGE OF THE RAIL AND INSIDE ON THE TABLE HIS OLD GRAY HAT SHOWED THAT ITS OWNER HAD NOT GONE FAR
BUT--THERE ARE WINDOWS OF COURSE AND THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT WHOEVER IS IN THERE FROM GETTING OUT THAT WAY THEN LOCK THE DOOR AT THE TOP OF THE BASEMENT STAIRS I SUGGESTED AND PATROL THE HOUSE FROM THE OUTSIDE WE AGREED TO THIS AND I HAD A FEELING THAT THE MYSTERY OF SUNNYSIDE WAS ABOUT TO BE SOLVED
COULD IT HAVE BEEN THOMAS
I HAD SEEN IT BEFORE MANY TIMES
AND YET--I WILL TAKE MY OATH NONE OF US EVEN INADVERTENTLY KILLED THAT POOR DEVIL I LOOKED AT THE CLOSED DOOR INTO GERTRUDE'S DRESSING-ROOM AND LOWERED MY VOICE
AND I NEARLY WEPT AGAIN
BUT THE LIGHTS WERE GONE FOR GOOD THAT NIGHT
MY LEASE IS FOR SIX MONTHS
WAS IT THE ONE THE PARLOR MAID BROUGHT UP YESTERDAY ABOUT A GHOST WRINGING ITS HANDS ON THE ROOF
WELL I WOULD HAVE HAD MY HANDS FULL BUT THE OTHER WOMAN DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR A GOOD WHILE AND WHEN SHE DID THE DOCTOR WAS HOME RIGGS I ASKED SUDDENLY DID YOU GET INTO THIS HOUSE A DAY OR TWO AFTER I TOOK IT AT NIGHT I DID NOT MISS INNES
THERE WAS NO ANSWER AS YET TO THIS OR TO THE NEXT QUESTIONS
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING TO DO GO AND CHOKE THOMAS BUT AT THAT MOMENT LOUISE ROUSED FROM HER STUPOR TO COUGH AND AT THE END OF THE PAROXYSM AS ROSIE LAID HER BACK EXHAUSTED SHE KNEW US
BELOW THE THREE OF US STARED AT ONE ANOTHER ACROSS THE INTERVENING WHITE BLANKET
IN ONE OF THE TULIP BEDS BACK OF THE HOUSE AN EARLY BLACKBIRD WAS PECKING VICIOUSLY AT SOMETHING THAT GLITTERED IN THE LIGHT
DURING HER SLOW PROGRESS DOWN THE STAIRS I HAD TIME TO NOTICE ONE THING
HALSEY CONSCIOUS AND IMPROVING
I SCREAMED I THINK
TO BE ALWAYS TOGETHER LIKE THIS HAND IN HAND
IT LAY AT THE FOOT OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
WHEN I HAD RENTED SUNNYSIDE HOWEVER SHE HAD THOUGHT THE PERSECUTIONS WOULD STOP
SOMEWHERE DOWN-STAIRS A CLOCK WITH A CHIME SANG AWAY THE HOURS--ELEVEN-THIRTY FORTY-FIVE TWELVE
HE AND GERTRUDE WENT ON TOGETHER LEAVING THE DETECTIVE TO WALK WITH ME
THERE'S SOMEBODY IN THE HOUSE I SAID
NOT POWER NOT AMBITION WAS HIS FETISH
I DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT GOING
SIGNED F
FROM THE CLATTER AND JARRING I KNEW THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE RUNNING UP THE STAIRS AND AS THE SOUNDS APPROACHED I COULD EVEN HEAR WHAT THEY SAID
IN THE WINGS WERE SMALL CORRIDORS CROSSING THE MAIN ONE--THE PLAN WAS SIMPLICITY ITSELF
IT WAS AFTER EIGHT WHEN HALSEY ORDERED THE CAR AND STARTED DOWN THE HILL AT A PACE THAT EVEN FOR HIM WAS UNUSUALLY RECKLESS
SHE WAS AFRAID TO SPEAK HOWEVER BECAUSE OF HER PREVIOUS SNUBBING AND WENT BACK STOPPING IN THE DOORWAY TO SIGH DISMALLY
I GOT UP THEN FEELING WEAK AND DIZZY AND PUT ON MY DRESSING-GOWN
THAT WHILE I WAS SEARCHING FOR HER THROUGH THE HOUSE I HAD MET A STRANGER WHO WHEN I FAINTED HAD CARRIED ME INTO A ROOM AND LEFT ME THERE TO GET BETTER OR NOT AS IT MIGHT HAPPEN
EVERY CONVERSATIONAL PATH LED TO IT AND WE ALL FELT THAT JAMIESON WAS TIGHTENING THE THREADS OF EVIDENCE AROUND JOHN BAILEY
THE HOUSE WAS QUIET
BUT THE CHILD WHO WAS ENTERED AS LUCIEN WALLACE WAS TAKEN AWAY BY HIS MOTHER TWO WEEKS AGO
A DESCRIPTION TO ONE OF THE DETECTIVES ON MY ARRIVAL AT HOME HAD STARTED THE BALL ROLLING
HALSEY WAS PROBABLY LATE--HE IS ALWAYS LATE
A NO I SAID WITH TRUTH ENOUGH SHE IS NOT A FRIEND OF MINE F
I REMEMBER STEPPING OVER THE CHAIR AND GLUING MY EAR TO THE DOOR AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET FEELING IT GIVE AN INCH OR TWO THERE IN THE DARKNESS UNDER A STEADY PRESSURE FROM WITHOUT
SHE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND BUT AN UNHAPPIER FACE I HAVE NEVER SEEN
HE HAD GONE UP TO THE HOUSE--THOMAS DID NOT KNOW WHY--AND AT THREE O'CLOCK HE WAS SHOT AT THE FOOT OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
WHERE WAS IT
WHERE WAS IT
MISS INNES THERE ARE A GREAT MANY THINGS YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND I AM AFRAID
WE HURRIED OVER THE REST OF THE LOCKING-UP AND GOT UPSTAIRS AS QUICKLY AS WE COULD
I GAVE THOMAS JOHNSON AND MRS WATSON PERMISSION TO GO INTO TOWN TO PAY THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO THE DEAD MAN BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY DID NOT CARE TO GO
BUT I HAD ONLY LOCATED THE HIDDEN ROOM
ODDLY ENOUGH I WAS NOT ALARMED
NO MAN EVER MADE A FOOL OF ME SHE REPLIED VIRTUOUSLY
IT WILL BE QUICKER
THERE WAS A PERIOD OF STRESS I THINK WHILE THE HEAVY COFFIN WAS BEING RAISED
YOU HEARD NO OTHER SOUND THE CORONER ASKED
IT SOUNDED LIKE A PUZZLE
WE WERE VERY SILENT
HALSEY WAS NOT WITH THEM
THERE WAS ONE THING WHICH LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE FOR JACK BAILEY
A LAPSE OF ANOTHER TEN MINUTES AND THE ASSISTANT CASHIER CAME OUT AND APPROACHED MR TRAUTMAN
HE PACKED A SUIT-CASE READY FOR INSTANT DEPARTURE
SHE MIGHT HAVE HEARD HIM FUMBLING AT THE DOOR HE HAD NO KEY THE POLICE SAY--AND THINKING IT WAS YOU OR JACK SHE ADMITTED HIM
HE WAS NOTICEABLY WHITE AND TREMBLING
I HAVE NO PATIENT I REPLIED STARTLED
SHE JUST LAY AND STARED AT ME AUNT RAY SHE SAID
IF WE HAD ALL BEEN MURDERED IN OUR BEDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR FAULT SHE SHIVERED
IT'S UP THAT TIGHT I CAN'T MOVE IT AND I DIDN'T LIKE TO ASK FOR HELP UNTIL I SPOKE TO YOU IT WAS USELESS TO DISSEMBLE
THERE WERE NO MARKS OF POWDER
WHO WAS THE CHILD'S MOTHER AND WHERE WAS SHE
I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR IT AND I SCARCELY KNEW HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR IT
EVERYTHING WAS BLACK
MR HARTON DID MR ARNOLD ARMSTRONG KNOW THAT SUNNYSIDE HAD BEEN RENTED I THINK--YES HE DID
YOU SAW HOW MUCH I LOVED YOU AND YOU LET ME THINK YOU CARED--FOR A WHILE
AT THE CORNER BY THE EAST WING I MET LIDDY
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE LIDDY PUSHED ASIDE A HALF-DOZEN GERANIUM POTS AND IN THE SPACE THUS CLEARED SHE DUMPED THE CONTENTS OF HER APRON--A HANDFUL OF TINY BITS OF PAPER
AFTER A DISCREET INTERVAL I WENT INTO THE OTHER ROOM AND FOUND LOUISE ALONE
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW MISS INNES HE SAID
W HUM I SAID
WE--CAN'T--GET--IN
THE INCIDENT WOULD HAVE ESCAPED ME BUT FOR A CURIOUS THING
TOGETHER YOU MAY BE ABLE TO FORCE THE DOOR A GOOD IDEA HE ASSENTED
WHERE WAS HALSEY
IN HIS HEADLONG FLIGHT DOWN THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE WITH WINTERS JUST BEHIND PAUL ARMSTRONG HAD PITCHED FORWARD VIOLENTLY STRUCK HIS HEAD AGAINST THE DOOR TO THE EAST VERANDA AND PROBABLY BROKEN HIS NECK
I WENT ASLEEP AS SOON AS I REACHED THIS DECISION AND IN MY DREAMS I LIVED OVER AGAIN THE EVENTS OF THE NIGHT
THE FOUR STEPS HAD BEEN SKIPPED
I WANT YOU TO SPEND ONE NIGHT AT LEAST WATCHING THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
YOU HAVE BEEN MISINFORMED I REPLIED
BUT MY ATTENTION WAS BUSY WITH THE ROOM BELOW
I DID NOT FEAR SUFFOCATION
AND THE FOOTPATH THERE IS OF CINDERS
SHE HID IN THE WEST WING UNTIL EVERY ONE WAS DOWN ON THE LOWER FLOOR
HE STOOD JUST INSIDE THE DOORWAY LOOKING FROM THE LUXURY OF THE HOUSE TO THE BEAUTY OF THE VIEW
