EMILY DOES THE BAKING AND ATTENDS TO THE KITCHEN
YOU WILL ASK
I AM GLAD OF THAT
THEIR NATURE I NEED NOT WRITE ON PAPER FOR I THINK I SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM
IN ENGLAND AND ACCEPT ONE OF 16_L
IN REALITY I IMAGINE BECAUSE SOME DISCOVERY HAD BEEN MADE WHICH RENDERED HIS ABSENCE IMPERATIVELY DESIRABLE
JULY 14 1829 IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT THE FOREGOING LETTER MAY HAVE HAD SOME ALLEGORICAL OR POLITICAL REFERENCE INVISIBLE TO OUR EYES BUT VERY CLEAR TO THE BRIGHT LITTLE MINDS FOR WHOM IT WAS INTENDED
MISS W MADE ME THE OFFER AND I PREFERRED IT TO ONE OR TWO PROPOSALS OF PRIVATE GOVERNESS-SHIP WHICH I HAD BEFORE RECEIVED
IL NAQUIT FILS D'UN SIMPLE GENTILHOMME ET MOURUT EMPEREUR MAIS SANS COURONNE ET DANS LES FERS
THE FORMER FROM RESERVE THE LATTER FROM TIMIDITY AVOIDED ALL FRIENDSHIPS AND INTIMACIES BEYOND THEIR FAMILY
WRITE TO ME AGAIN SOON
FOR INSTANCE HE MADE THEM STAND ON ONE LEG IN A CORNER OF THE SCHOOLROOM HOLDING A HEAVY BOOK IN EACH HAND
BUT SEE THE JUST AND ADMIRABLE SENSE WITH WHICH SHE CAN TREAT A SUBJECT OF WHICH SHE IS ABLE TO OVERLOOK ALL THE BEARINGS
SO GENTLE AND KIND AND SO VERY QUIET
I HAVE READ ABOUT HALF
EVEN NOW THE MEMORY OF THIS GOOD MAN IS HELD IN REVERENCE AND HIS FAITHFUL MINISTRATIONS AND REAL VIRTUES ARE ONE OF THE BOASTS OF THE PARISH
20TH
AND HENCEFORWARD SHE WAS CALLED MADEMOISELLE CHARLOTTE BY M
AFTER THIS FOR A LONG TIME NOTHING WORTH NOTICING OCCURRED
I CONSIDER THEM BIGOTED INTOLERANT AND WHOLLY UNJUSTIFIABLE ON THE GROUND OF COMMON SENSE
I AM THANKFUL PAPA CONTINUES PRETTY WELL THOUGH OFTEN MADE VERY MISERABLE BY BRANWELL'S WRETCHED CONDUCT
LA GLOIRE DE NAPOLEON CRUT EN UNE NUIT COMME LA VIGNE DE JONAS ET IL SUFFIT D'UN JOUR POUR LA FLETRIR
IF YOU KNEW MY THOUGHTS THE DREAMS THAT ABSORB ME AND THE FIERY IMAGINATION THAT AT TIMES EATS ME UP AND MAKES ME FEEL SOCIETY AS IT IS WRETCHEDLY INSIPID YOU WOULD PITY AND I DARE SAY DESPISE ME
I ONLY STIPULATE FOR CLEAR TYPE NOT TOO SMALL AND GOOD PAPER ON FEBRUARY 21ST SHE SELECTS THE LONG PRIMER TYPE FOR THE POEMS AND WILL REMIT 31_L
AND I FEEL AS IF I WOULD RATHER RUN THE RISK OF LOSS THAN HURT EMILY'S FEELINGS BY ACTING IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO HER OPINION
AND ALSO THAT SUCH INFORMATION AS I HAVE OBTAINED FROM HER BEARS REFERENCE SOLELY TO MISS BRONTE AND HER SISTERS AND NOT TO ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOM I MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO ALLUDE TO IN CONNECTION WITH THEM
OF THOUSANDS ON LONELY MOORS
BELL WITH MR AYLOTT
DO YOU KNOW THIS PLACE
I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE FIERCE ACTIONS AND UTTERANCES OF ONE SUFFERING FROM DELIRIUM TREMENS
SHE LEFT US LAST MONDAY
OR FROM MR BRONTE WHOSE INTERCOURSE WITH HIS CHILDREN APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY RESTRAINED AND WHOSE LIFE BOTH IN IRELAND AND AT CAMBRIDGE HAD BEEN SPENT UNDER PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES
ONE TIME I MENTIONED THAT SOME ONE HAD ASKED ME WHAT RELIGION I WAS OF WITH THE VIEW OF GETTING ME FOR A PARTIZAN AND THAT I HAD SAID THAT THAT WAS BETWEEN GOD AND ME;--EMILY WHO WAS LYING ON THE HEARTH-RUG EXCLAIMED THAT'S RIGHT THIS WAS ALL I EVER HEARD EMILY SAY ON RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS
ISLANDERS DECEMBER 1827
JOHNSON SHERIDAN C SHE SAID NOW YOU DON'T KNOW THE MEANING OF CLEVER SHERIDAN MIGHT BE CLEVER
AFTER ALL HER PREPARATIONS NOT A PUPIL HAD OFFERED HERSELF
IN JANUARY 1831 CHARLOTTE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AGAIN
THE READERS OF SHIRLEY MAY REMEMBER THAT IT IS ONE OF THE TESTS WHICH THE HEROINE APPLIES TO HER LOVER
LINES WRITTEN ON THE SUMMIT OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND

EXTREMELY RESERVED IN MANNER
SOMETIMES THE SOLITUDE OPPRESSES ME TO AN EXCESS
HAWORTH NEAR BRADFORD
E WAS YOUNGER THAN SHE AND HER TENDER HEART WAS TOUCHED BY THE APPARENTLY DESOLATE CONDITION IN WHICH SHE FOUND THE ODDLY-DRESSED ODD-LOOKING LITTLE GIRL THAT WINTER MORNING AS SICK FOR HOME SHE STOOD IN TEARS IN A NEW STRANGE PLACE AMONG NEW STRANGE PEOPLE
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE FOLLOWING LETTER WRITTEN TO THE THEN ABSENT E THERE IS I THINK AS PRETTY A GLIMPSE OF A MERRY GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE AS NEED BE
SHE WORSHIPPED THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON BUT SAID THAT SIR ROBERT PEEL WAS NOT TO BE TRUSTED
BRANWELL STILL REMAINS AT HOME
BRONTE A.B MINISTER OF HAWORTH
WHEN THE FIRST SHOCK WAS OVER THE THREE SISTERS BEGAN TO ENJOY THE FULL RELISH OF MEETING AGAIN AFTER THE LONGEST SEPARATION THEY HAD HAD IN THEIR LIVES
I COOLED A LITTLE INDEED AND DREW IN TOWARDS THE LATTER PART OF THE EVENING BECAUSE HE BEGAN TO SEASON HIS CONVERSATION WITH SOMETHING OF HIBERNIAN FLATTERY WHICH I DID NOT QUITE RELISH
BEHIND THIS WAS THE KITCHEN
IT HURRIES SOBBING OVER HILLS OF SULLEN OUTLINE COLOURLESS WITH TWILIGHT AND MIST
AT THE EXPIRATION OF THAT PERIOD HE HAD THE LIVING OF THORNTON IN BRADFORD PARISH
MISS W HAS DRIVEN ME TO IT
NOW REALLY HOW CAN YOU BE SO FOOLISH
THEIR USUAL WALKS OBSTRUCTED BY THE SPONGY STATE OF THE MOORS--THE PASSING AND FUNERAL BELLS SO FREQUENTLY TOLLING AND FILLING THE HEAVY AIR WITH THEIR MOURNFUL SOUND--AND WHEN THEY WERE STILL THE CHIP CHIP OF THE MASON AS HE CUT THE GRAVE-STONES IN A SHED CLOSE BY
LA PUISSANCE DE PIERRE L'HERMITE N'ETAIT NULLEMENT UNE PUISSANCE PHYSIQUE CAR LA NATURE OU POUR MIEUX DIRE DIEU EST IMPARTIAL DANS LA DISTRIBUTION DE SES DONS
SOME RESTING THEIR ACHING HEADS ON THE TABLE OTHERS ON THE GROUND
WHEN THE GIRLS WERE READY WITH THEIR LESSONS THEY CAME TO MISS W TO SAY THEM
IT SEEMS THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN IN ANY WAY REMARKABLE FOR RELIGIOUS ZEAL THOUGH HE HAD LED A MORAL LIFE AND BEEN CONSCIENTIOUS IN FULFILLING HIS PAROCHIAL DUTIES UNTIL A CERTAIN SUNDAY IN SEPTEMBER 1744 WHEN THE SERVANT RISING AT FIVE FOUND HER MASTER ALREADY ENGAGED IN PRAYER
SHE BREATHES SHORT HAS A PAIN IN HER CHEST AND FREQUENT FLUSHINGS OF FEVER
THEY BEGAN TO LOSE ALL HOPE IN HIS FUTURE CAREER
ALL TIME WAS LOST IN WHICH SHE WAS NOT MAKING PROGRESS HOWEVER SLOW TOWARDS IT
SHE KNEW THE HOPES AND PROSPECTS OF THE TEACHERS AND MENTIONED ONE WHO WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO MARRY SHE WAS GETTING SO OLD SHE USED TO GET HER FATHER OR BROTHER I FORGET WHICH TO BE THE BEARER OF LETTERS TO DIFFERENT SINGLE MEN WHO SHE THOUGHT MIGHT BE PERSUADED TO DO HER THE FAVOUR SAYING THAT HER ONLY RESOURCE WAS TO BECOME A SISTER OF CHARITY IF HER PRESENT EMPLOYMENT FAILED AND THAT SHE HATED THE IDEA
QU'ON NE SE PERMETTE DONC PAS D'APPROCHER DU SEPULCRE DU CORSE AVEC SENTIMENTS DE PITIE OU DE SOUILLER DE LARMES LA PIERRE QUI COUVRE SES RESTES SON AME REPUDIERAIT TOUT CELA
I BEGAN WITH THE YOUNGEST ANNE AFTERWARDS ACTON BELL AND ASKED WHAT A CHILD LIKE HER MOST WANTED
AYLOTT THE MESSRS
SAY WHEN YOU GO AND I SHALL BE ABLE IN MY ANSWER TO SAY DECIDEDLY WHETHER I CAN ACCOMPANY YOU OR NOT
AT TIMES I FELT--AND I SUPPOSE SEEMED--DEPRESSED
WE HAVE SEEN SOMETHING OF THIS TREMBLING DISTRUST OF HER OWN CAPABILITY OF INSPIRING AFFECTION IN THE GRATEFUL SURPRISE SHE EXPRESSES AT THE REGRET FELT BY HER BELGIAN PUPILS AT HER DEPARTURE
DO HAVE THE CHRISTIAN CHARITY TO WRITE ME A LONG LONG LETTER
MARTHA IS CHATTERING AS FAST AS HER LITTLE TONGUE CAN RUN
BUT THE SMALL SUM WHICH THEY EACH INDEPENDENTLY POSSESSED WOULD ENABLE THEM TO EFFECT SUCH ALTERATIONS IN THE PARSONAGE-HOUSE AT HAWORTH AS WOULD ADAPT IT TO THE RECEPTION OF PUPILS
CHARLOTTE WAS THUS SUDDENLY CALLED INTO THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF ELDEST SISTER IN A MOTHERLESS FAMILY
I WAS AT THAT TIME HIGH-SPIRITED AND IMPETUOUS NOT RESPECTING THE FRENCH MISTRESSES
SO WRITTEN IT IS WHOLESOME BOTH FOR THE HEART AND SOUL
SHE DREADED IT AS SOMETHING HORRIBLE
I HAVE HAD LETTERS TO WRITE LATELY TO BRUSSELS TO LILLE AND TO LONDON
THUS IN ONE DELIGHTFUL THOUGH SOMEWHAT MONOTONOUS COURSE MY LIFE IS PASSED
THE D.S WERE LEAVING BRUSSELS
BUT BECAUSE I REMEMBER IT
AND BY NINE HE THE AUNT AND TABBY WERE ALL IN BED,--THE GIRLS FREE TO PACE UP AND DOWN LIKE RESTLESS WILD ANIMALS IN THE PARLOUR TALKING OVER PLANS AND PROJECTS AND THOUGHTS OF WHAT WAS TO BE THEIR FUTURE LIFE
MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY WRONG THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED
IL VOIT LE CROISSANT ARGENT EST ARRACHE DU TEMPLE ET L'ORIFLAMME ET LA CROIX ROUGE SONT ETABLI A SA PLACE
AFTER DINNER I SEW TILL TEA-TIME AND AFTER TEA I EITHER WRITE READ OR DO A LITTLE FANCY-WORK OR DRAW AS I PLEASE
WE ARE COMPLETELY ISOLATED IN THE MIDST OF NUMBERS
A THING OF 14 LINES
THE GREEN DWARF A TALE OF THE PERFECT TENSE BY THE LORD CHARLES ALBERT FLORIAN WELLESLEY
AND ONE PIECE OF BREAD THIS WAS THE ONLY TIME AT WHICH THE FOOD WAS LIMITED FOR THE ELDER PUPILS WHO SAT UP TILL A LATER MEAL OF THE SAME DESCRIPTION
AS I HAVE ALREADY INTIMATED FOR SOME REASON WITH WHICH I AM UNACQUAINTED THE PLAN OF SENDING BRANWELL TO STUDY AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY HAD BEEN RELINQUISHED
SIR MARCH 16TH
BUT IT APPEARS FROM THE LETTERS THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO TO SPEAK CONSTITUTIONAL
AND NOW THAT IMPEDIMENTS SEEM TO START UP AT EVERY STEP OPPOSITION GROWS MORE OPEN
MISS BRANWELL AND HER COUSIN INTENDED TO SET ABOUT MAKING THE WEDDING-CAKE IN THE FOLLOWING WEEK SO THE MARRIAGE COULD NOT BE FAR OFF
I NOW COME TO A PART OF MY SUBJECT WHICH I FIND GREAT DIFFICULTY IN TREATING BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE RELATING TO IT ON EACH SIDE IS SO CONFLICTING THAT IT SEEMS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ARRIVE AT THE TRUTH
SHE AS A SORT OF INDEMNIFICATION TO THE ARBALETRIERS CAUSED A GREAT MANSION TO BE BUILT FOR THEIR ACCOMMODATION IN THE NEW RUE D'ISABELLE
THEY WERE TOO FULL OF EARNEST THOUGHT AND OF THE EXILE'S SICK YEARNING TO BE READY FOR CARELESS CONVERSATION OR MERRY GAME
I HAVE KNOWN PEOPLE WHO TRAVELLING BY THE MAIL-COACH OVER BLACKSTONE EDGE HAD BEEN SNOWED UP FOR A WEEK OR TEN DAYS AT THE LITTLE INN NEAR THE SUMMIT AND OBLIGED TO SPEND BOTH CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S DAY THERE TILL THE STORE OF PROVISIONS LAID IN FOR THE USE OF THE LANDLORD AND HIS FAMILY FALLING SHORT BEFORE THE INROADS OF THE UNEXPECTED VISITORS THEY HAD RECOURSE TO THE TURKEYS GEESE AND YORKSHIRE PIES WITH WHICH THE COACH WAS LADEN
BUT ONCE LOVERS OR HATERS IT IS DIFFICULT TO CHANGE THEIR FEELING
FLOWERS BRIGHTER THAN THE ROSE BLOOMED IN THE BLACKEST OF THE HEATH FOR HER;--OUT OF A SULLEN HOLLOW IN A LIVID HILL-SIDE HER MIND COULD MAKE AN EDEN
MANY OF THEM WERE EMPLOYED IN THE NEIGHBOURING WORSTED MILLS
NOUS N'AVONS EU QUE BIEN PEU A FAIRE AVEC DE PAREILLES ELEVES
BUT WITH YOU WHOM I LIKE AND KNOW AND WHO KNOWS ME
TEACHING SEEMED TO HER AT THIS TIME AS IT DOES TO MOST WOMEN AT ALL TIMES THE ONLY WAY OF EARNING AN INDEPENDENT LIVELIHOOD
HIS OPINIONS MIGHT BE OFTEN BOTH WILD AND ERRONEOUS HIS PRINCIPLES OF ACTION ECCENTRIC AND STRANGE HIS VIEWS OF LIFE PARTIAL AND ALMOST MISANTHROPICAL
SHE DESERVED THE REWARD I KNEW
I WAS DELIBERATING ON PLANS IMPORTANT TO MY FUTURE PROSPECTS
I HAVE ACCORDINGLY DONE SO AND FROM THE LIPS OF SOME OF THE SURVIVORS AMONG THE ACTORS AND SPECTATORS I HAVE LEARNT THE MEANS TAKEN TO EJECT THE NOMINEE OF THE VICAR
IL FAUDRA PEUT-ETRE UN SIECLE A L'ANGLETERRE POUR QU'ELLE CONNAISE LA VALEUR DE SON HEROS
HEGER IS TO ME
AND AS SHE INSENSIBLY GAINED THEIR AFFECTION HER OWN INTEREST IN THEM WAS INCREASING
THE TERM LASS WAS AS FREELY APPLIED TO ANY YOUNG LADY AS THE WORD WENCH IS IN LANCASHIRE
I RETURNED TO IT WITH THE SAME AVIDITY THAT A COW THAT HAS LONG BEEN KEPT ON DRY HAY RETURNS TO FRESH GRASS
THE BEST WAY OF PREPARING HIM TO BECOME SO APPEARED TO BE TO SEND HIM AS A PUPIL TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY
I HEARD FROM THEM THIS MORNING
IT IS NEITHER OLD ENOUGH NOR MODERN ENOUGH TO COMPEL NOTICE
THOUGHT YOU GROWN LESS DID SHE
EVEN IN HIS OLD AGE MR BRONTE IS A STRIKING-LOOKING MAN ABOVE THE COMMON HEIGHT WITH A NOBLY-SHAPED HEAD AND ERECT CARRIAGE
HE DID NOT RANT
IT IS TRUE THIS PLACE IS DISMAL TO ME BUT I CANNOT GO HOME WITHOUT A FIXED PROSPECT WHEN I GET THERE
AND SAID THAT SHE SAW NO GOOD TO BE DERIVED FROM IT
BUT THE WHOLESOME SENSE OF DUTY IN IT--THE SENSE OF THE SUPREMACY OF THAT DUTY WHICH GOD IN PLACING US IN FAMILIES HAS LAID OUT FOR US SEEMS TO DESERVE ESPECIAL REGARD IN THESE DAYS
THEY WERE HAPPY TOO IN POSSESSING FRIENDS WHOSE SOCIETY HAD BEEN FOR YEARS CONGENIAL TO THEM AND IN OCCASIONAL MEETINGS WITH THESE THEY COULD HAVE THE INEXPRESSIBLE SOLACE TO RESIDENTS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY--AND PECULIARLY SUCH TO THE BRONTES--OF TALKING OVER THE INTELLIGENCE RECEIVED FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES--REFERRING TO PAST OR PLANNING FOR FUTURE DAYS
YET THIS IS ONLY FOUR MILES FROM B MARCH 21ST
AND HAD A MODEST CONFIDENCE THAT THEY HAD ACHIEVED A TOLERABLE SUCCESS
MANY YEARS LATER DURING HIS RESIDENCE AT HAWORTH THERE WAS A STRIKE
I AM GOING TO TEACH IN THE VERY SCHOOL WHERE I WAS MYSELF TAUGHT
IN SUMMER WHITE FROCKS ON SUNDAYS AND NANKEEN ON OTHER DAYS
THEY SAID SHE ENLIVENED THE SOMBRE COURT OF KING LEOPOLD WHICH IS USUALLY AS GLOOMY AS A CONVENTICLE
IT STANDS FACING THE LECK BETWEEN WHICH AND IT INTERVENES A SPACE ABOUT SEVENTY YARDS DEEP THAT WAS ONCE THE SCHOOL GARDEN
THE BRIGHT LOOK-OUT THROUGH THE GARDEN-DOOR UPON THE GRASSY LAWNS AND TERRACES BEHIND WHERE THE SOFT-HUED PIGEONS STILL LOVE TO COO AND STRUT IN THE SUN,--ARE DESCRIBED IN SHIRLEY THE SCENERY OF THAT FICTION LIES CLOSE AROUND
THE WELL-BOUND WERE RANGED IN THE SANCTUARY OF MR BRONTE'S STUDY
MAIS PARLER AINSI N'EST-CE PAS ATTRIBUER GRATUITEMENT A NAPOLEON UNE HUMAINE FAIBLESSE QU'IL N'EPROUVA JAMAIS
TO LIVE A LIFE OF ACTION
HER EYES FAILED HER IN THE MINUTE KIND OF DRAWING WHICH SHE PRACTISED WHEN SHE WANTED TO EXPRESS AN IDEA
BUT THERE ARE COARSE LINES ABOUT THE MOUTH AND THE LIPS THOUGH OF HANDSOME SHAPE ARE LOOSE AND THICK INDICATING SELF-INDULGENCE WHILE THE SLIGHTLY RETREATING CHIN CONVEYS AN IDEA OF WEAKNESS OF WILL
BUT THERE IS LITTLE IN THE REVIEW TO STRAIN OUT AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME AS WORTH PRESERVING
BUT WHO EVER ROSE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT AMBITION
HIS PREDECESSOR THE VENERABLE JOHN CROSSE KNOWN AS THE BLIND VICAR HAD BEEN INATTENTIVE TO THE VICARIAL CLAIMS
AND THEIR PRINCIPLES ARE ROTTEN TO THE CORE
BUT IT WAS OTHERWISE WITH CHARLOTTE BRONTE
E.'S HOME WAS FIVE MILES AWAY
WHY ARE YOU SO GLUM TO-NIGHT TABBY
THE CHILDREN ARE CONSTANTLY WITH ME
TABBY THE SERVANT IS WASHING UP THE BREAKFAST-THINGS AND ANNE MY YOUNGEST SISTER MARIA WAS MY ELDEST IS KNEELING ON A CHAIR LOOKING AT SOME CAKES WHICH TABBY HAS BEEN BAKING FOR US
VOUS AVEZ COMMENCE A PARLER DE PIERRE
FOR THOUGH COWAN BRIDGE IS SITUATED ON A PLAIN IT IS A PLAIN FROM WHICH THERE IS MANY A FALL AND LONG DESCENT BEFORE YOU AND THE LECK REACH THE VALLEY OF THE LUNE
I HAVE NOTHING TO TELL YOU
IT IS KNOWN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO BE THE PLACE DESCRIBED AS FIELD HEAD SHIRLEY'S RESIDENCE
HER WORDS WERE FAR FROM FLATTERY
PEUT-ETRE LA AUSSI A-T-IL SENTI LUI FOUILLANT LE FLANC CET INSATIABLE VAUTOUR DONT PARLE LA FABLE PEUT-ETRE A-T-IL SOUFFERT AUSSI CETTE SOIF DU COEUR CETTE FAIM DE L'AME QUI TORTURENT L'EXILE LOIN DE SA FAMILLE ET DE SA PATRIE
I FIND THIS IN RECALLING WHAT I HAVE HEARD AND THE AUTHORITY ON WHICH I HAVE HEARD ANYTHING
AND THAT IF THE SPECULATION IS INTENDED TO BE A GOOD AND SUCCESSFUL ONE HALF THE SUM AT LEAST OUGHT TO BE LAID OUT IN THE MANNER I HAVE MENTIONED THEREBY INSURING A MORE SPEEDY REPAYMENT BOTH OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL
I HAVE ASKED THIS DAY TWO PERSONS WHO LIVED IN HAWORTH AT THE TIME TO WHICH YOU ALLUDE THE SON AND DAUGHTER OF AN ACTING TRUSTEE AND EACH OF THEM BETWEEN SIXTY AND SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE AND THEY ASSURE ME THAT THE DONKEY WAS INTRODUCED
AND IN LONELY HOUSES ON THE DISTANT HILL SIDE OR BY THE SMALL MAGNATES OF SECLUDED HAMLETS CRIMES MIGHT BE COMMITTED ALMOST UNKNOWN CERTAINLY WITHOUT ANY GREAT UPRISING OF POPULAR INDIGNATION CALCULATED TO BRING DOWN THE STRONG ARM OF THE LAW
THEY HAD MUCH TO TELL OF THE PAST AND MUCH TO SETTLE FOR THE FUTURE
IN FRONT OF THIS GARDEN ON THE SAME SIDE AS THE MANSION AND WITH GREAT BOUGHS OF TREES SWEEPING OVER THEIR LOWLY ROOFS IS A ROW OF SMALL PICTURESQUE OLD-FASHIONED COTTAGES NOT UNLIKE IN DEGREE AND UNIFORMITY TO THE ALMSHOUSES SO OFTEN SEEN IN AN ENGLISH COUNTRY TOWN
WE HAVE AS YET NO FIRES HERE AND I SUFFER MUCH FROM COLD
SHE ANSWERED THE BOOK OF NATURE I THEN ASKED THE NEXT WHAT WAS THE BEST MODE OF EDUCATION FOR A WOMAN
SO REASONED MISS BRANWELL THE PRUDENT NOT TO SAY ANXIOUS AUNT
HE WOULD SPEAK HIS BROADEST BRING OUT HIS OPINIONS ON CHURCH AND STATE IN THEIR MOST STARTLING FORMS AND BY AND BY IF HE FOUND HIS HEARER COULD STAND THE SHOCK HE WOULD INVOLUNTARILY SHOW HIS WARM KIND HEART AND HIS TRUE TASTE AND REAL REFINEMENT
OVER THAT FIRST CLASS SHE WAS SURVEILLANTE AT ALL HOURS
UPON THIS THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO INTRODUCE MR REDHEAD
I SHALL SOON BE THIRTY
NOT TO BE ABLE TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THEY ARE UNATTRACTIVE AND THAT THEY HAD BETTER BE QUIET AND THINK OF OTHER THINGS THAN WEDLOCK THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXTRACT FROM ONE OF THE FEW LETTERS WHICH HAVE BEEN PRESERVED OF HER CORRESPONDENCE WITH HER SISTER EMILY MAY 29 1843 I GET ON HERE FROM DAY TO DAY IN A ROBINSON-CRUSOE-LIKE SORT OF WAY VERY LONELY BUT THAT DOES NOT SIGNIFY
ARTHUR WELLESLEY NE SE SOUCIE NI DE L'UNE NI DE L'AUTRE
MISS W WAS SORRY AND REGRETTED THAT SHE HAD SET CHARLOTTE SO LONG A TASK
MARIA'S BED STOOD NEAREST TO THE DOOR OF THIS ROOM
I HAVE IN FACT TWO FRIENDS--YOU AND HER--STAUNCH AND TRUE IN WHOSE FAITH AND SINCERITY I HAVE AS STRONG A BELIEF AS I HAVE IN THE BIBLE
S MARRIAGE
IT COULD NOT HASTEN THEIR MOVEMENTS FOR EVERY ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE FOR SPEED
HOWEVER IT BEHOVES ME TO WRITE A LETTER TO A YOUNG WOMAN OF THE NAME OF E WITH WHOM I WAS ONCE ACQUAINTED IN LIFE'S MORNING MARCH WHEN MY SPIRIT WAS YOUNG THIS YOUNG WOMAN WISHED ME TO WRITE TO HER SOME TIME SINCE THOUGH I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY--I E'EN PUT IT OFF DAY BY DAY TILL AT LAST FEARING THAT SHE WILL CURSE ME BY HER GODS I FEEL CONSTRAINED TO SIT DOWN AND TACK A FEW LINES TOGETHER WHICH SHE MAY CALL A LETTER OR NOT AS SHE PLEASES
AVERSE TO PERSONAL PUBLICITY WE VEILED OUR OWN NAMES UNDER THOSE OF CURRER ELLIS AND ACTON BELL
SHE WAS LIFTED UP AND CARRIED INTO THE DRUGGIST'S NEAR
LONG-CONTINUED ILL HEALTH A DERANGED CONDITION OF THE LIVER HER CLOSE APPLICATION TO MINUTE DRAWING AND WRITING IN HER YOUNGER DAYS HER NOW HABITUAL SLEEPLESSNESS AT NIGHTS THE MANY BITTER NOISELESS TEARS SHE HAD SHED OVER BRANWELL'S MYSTERIOUS AND DISTRESSING CONDUCT--ALL THESE CAUSES WERE TELLING ON HER POOR EYES
AT SUCH TIMES EMILY WOULD EXPRESS HERSELF AS STRONGLY AS CHARLOTTE ALTHOUGH PERHAPS LESS FREQUENTLY
I OUGHT TO CONSIDER MYSELF WELL OFF AND TO BE THANKFUL FOR MY GOOD FORTUNES
PUISQUE COMME LE TRAJET ETAIT LONG ET DIFFICILE IL JETA LA CASQUE ET LES ARMES DU SOLDAT ET SE VETIT DE L'HABIT SIMPLE DU MOINE
SHE CORRECTED ONE OF US ONCE FOR USING THE WORD SPIT OR SPITTING SHE MADE A GREAT FAVOURITE OF BRANWELL
I DO NOT THINK THAT MRS BRONTE EVER REVISITED CORNWALL BUT SHE HAS LEFT A VERY PLEASANT IMPRESSION ON THE MINDS OF THOSE RELATIONS WHO YET SURVIVE
19TH 1848 AGED 29 YEARS SON AND DAUGHTER OF THE REV
UNFORTUNATELY SHE KNOWS US ONLY VERY SLIGHTLY
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I DARE NOT PRESS YOUR VISIT HERE AT LEAST UNTIL SHE IS PRONOUNCED OUT OF DANGER
I FELT THAT HOWEVER OFTEN I WAS DISAPPOINTED I HAD NO INTENTION OF RELINQUISHING MY EFFORTS
AND MANY A HAPPY WALK UP THOSE LONG FOUR MILES MUST THEY HAVE HAD BURDENED WITH SOME NEW BOOK INTO WHICH THEY PEEPED AS THEY HURRIED HOME
NO ONE WENT WITH HER
HEGER EST PROFONDEMENT ET OUVERTEMENT RELIGIEUX
327
TWO ROMANTIC TALES IN ONE VOLUME
YET IF THE FOREIGNER TAKES ALL THIS CHURLISHNESS GOOD-HUMOUREDLY OR AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND MAKES GOOD ANY CLAIM UPON THEIR LATENT KINDLINESS AND HOSPITALITY THEY ARE FAITHFUL AND GENEROUS AND THOROUGHLY TO BE RELIED UPON
I RECEIVED THE NUMBER OF THE RECORD YOU SENT I READ D'AUBIGNE'S LETTER
THOUGH INEXPERIENCED OURSELVES WE HAD READ THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS
BUT THE EXCITEMENT IS PAST AND I AM NOW AS WRETCHED AND HOPELESS AS EVER
PARFOIS IL LUI TEMOIGNA SA COLERE ET SA HAINE PAR DES GROGNEMENTS PAR DES HURLEMENTS DE BETES FAUVES
WITTY LIVELY ARDENT CLEVER TOO
AUTHORS ARE GENERALLY VERY TENACIOUS OF THEIR PRODUCTIONS BUT I AM NOT SO MUCH ATTACHED TO THIS BUT THAT I CAN GIVE IT UP WITHOUT MUCH DISTRESS
YET IN SPITE OF THESE UNSOCIABLE HABITS SHE WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH HER SCHOOL-FELLOWS
FOR INSTANCE IN THE PRESENT CASE WHERE A WORK OF FICTION IS IN QUESTION IN WHAT FORM WOULD A PUBLISHER BE MOST LIKELY TO ACCEPT THE MS
EXCUSE ME IF I SAY NOTHING BUT NONSENSE FOR MY MIND IS EXHAUSTED AND DISPIRITED
IN OUR PLAY HOURS SHE SATE OR STOOD STILL WITH A BOOK IF POSSIBLE
THEY WERE NOT STRONG WHEN THEY CAME HAVING ONLY JUST RECOVERED FROM A COMPLICATION OF MEASLES AND HOOPING-COUGH
HE TOOK HER HOME BY THE LEEDS COACH THE GIRLS CROWDING OUT INTO THE ROAD TO FOLLOW HER WITH THEIR EYES OVER THE BRIDGE PAST THE COTTAGES AND THEN OUT OF SIGHT FOR EVER
SO HOME I WENT AND THE CHANGE HAS AT ONCE ROUSED AND SOOTHED ME
N
OF COURSE THE SERVICE WAS A VERY LONG ONE AND AS THE TIME WAS JUNE AND THE WEATHER OFTEN HOT IT USED TO BE REGARDED BY MYSELF AND MY COMPANIONS AS NO PLEASURABLE WAY OF PASSING THE MORNING
ONE OF THEM SAYS IT WAS MOUNTED BY A HALF-WITTED MAN SEATED WITH HIS FACE TOWARDS THE TAIL OF THE BEAST AND HAVING SEVERAL HATS PILED ON HIS HEAD
IN THE GATHERING DUSK OF AN AUTUMN EVENING TABBY CAME HALF-TRIUMPHANTLY HALF-TREMBLINGLY BUT IN GREAT WRATH TO TELL EMILY THAT KEEPER WAS LYING ON THE BEST BED IN DROWSY VOLUPTUOUSNESS
IT WAS TIME TO DECIDE
THE TOWN OF KEIGHLEY NEVER QUITE MELTS INTO COUNTRY ON THE ROAD TO HAWORTH ALTHOUGH THE HOUSES BECOME MORE SPARSE AS THE TRAVELLER JOURNEYS UPWARDS TO THE GREY ROUND HILLS THAT SEEM TO BOUND HIS JOURNEY IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION
BUT HE WHO STRUCK HIM WITH A STICK OR WHIP ROUSED THE RELENTLESS NATURE OF THE BRUTE WHO FLEW AT HIS THROAT FORTHWITH AND HELD HIM THERE TILL ONE OR THE OTHER WAS AT THE POINT OF DEATH
THE GREAT MANSION WITH ITS QUADRANGULAR FORM
BUT JOHNSON HADN'T A SPARK OF CLEVERALITY IN HIM NO ONE APPRECIATED THE OPINION
THENCE HE PROCEEDED TO ST JOHN'S COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE WHERE HE WAS ENTERED IN JULY 1802 BEING AT THE TIME FIVE-AND-TWENTY YEARS OF AGE
STONE CROSSES LIKE THESE ARE NOT UNFAMILIAR TO YOU NOR ARE THESE DIM GARLANDS OF EVERLASTING FLOWERS
SHE HAD LED TOO SEDENTARY A LIFE HE SAID
HE HAD THE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES OF WATCHING THEM FROM HIS GIVING LESSONS IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE IN THE SCHOOL
S.--STRIKE OUT THAT WORD DARLING IT IS HUMBUG
BUT SHE APPEARED EGOTISTICAL AND EXACTING COMPARED TO CHARLOTTE WHO WAS ALWAYS UNSELFISH THIS IS M
RICH PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE MANY PLEASURES AT THEIR COMMAND WHICH WE ARE DEBARRED FROM
WITH THE GIFT CAME A WARNING
AND THE NAMES OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY BELONG ARE PAINTED IN WHITE LETTERS ON THE DOORS
IN RECOMPENSE FOR THIS ISABELLA--WHO HERSELF WAS A MEMBER OF THE GUILD AND HAD EVEN SHOT DOWN THE BIRD AND BEEN QUEEN IN 1615--MADE MANY PRESENTS TO THE ARBALETRIERS
AND TAKING A CAB THEREFORE AT THE STATION SHE DROVE STRAIGHT TO THE LONDON BRIDGE WHARF AND DESIRED A WATERMAN TO ROW HER TO THE OSTEND PACKET WHICH WAS TO SAIL THE NEXT MORNING
TO DO WHILE THEY ARE ONLY TO BE
I HAVE HAD A LONG LETTER FROM MARY AND A PACKET CONTAINING A PRESENT OF A VERY HANDSOME BLACK SILK SCARF AND A PAIR OF BEAUTIFUL KID GLOVES BOUGHT AT BRUSSELS
THE FIRST PART OF HER TIME AT BRUSSELS WAS NOT UNINTERESTING
YOU HAVE BEEN AT BATH LONG ENOUGH FOR ALL PURPOSES
SHE FOLLOWED AND TRIED TO INDUCE HIM TO COME AWAY
ON THIS THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED WITH A CHIMNEY-SWEEPER WHOM THEY HAD EMPLOYED TO CLEAN THE CHIMNEYS OF SOME OUT-BUILDINGS BELONGING TO THE CHURCH THAT VERY MORNING AND AFTERWARD PLIED WITH DRINK TILL HE WAS IN A STATE OF SOLEMN INTOXICATION
I WAS GREATLY AMUSED AT THE TONE OF NONCHALANCE WHICH YOU ASSUMED WHILE TREATING OF LONDON AND ITS WONDERS
THE ONLY GLIMPSE WE GET OF ELIZABETH THROUGH THE FEW YEARS OF HER SHORT LIFE IS CONTAINED IN A LETTER WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED FROM MISS TEMPLE THE SECOND ELIZABETH IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE FAMILY OF WHOM I HAVE A VIVID RECOLLECTION FROM HER MEETING WITH A SOMEWHAT ALARMING ACCIDENT IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH I HAD HER FOR SOME DAYS AND NIGHTS IN MY BEDROOM NOT ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF GREATER QUIET BUT THAT I MIGHT WATCH OVER HER MYSELF
CHARLOTTE WRITES JANUARY 20TH 1842
BUT THEY NEVER FACED THEIR KIND VOLUNTARY AND ALWAYS PREFERRED THE SOLITUDE AND FREEDOM OF THE MOORS
AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT I AM VERY GLAD TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER YOUR KIND INQUIRIES BY THE ASSURANCE THAT OUR SMALL CAPITAL IS AS YET UNDIMINISHED
THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS KINDLY FURNISHED ME WITH SOME OF THE PARTICULARS I HAVE GIVEN REMEMBERS THE BULL-BAITINGS AT ROCHDALE NOT THIRTY YEARS AGO
ALL ROUND THE HORIZON THERE IS THIS SAME LINE OF SINUOUS WAVE-LIKE HILLS
BRANWELL WAS THERE UNEXPECTEDLY VERY ILL
HIS FAMILY OF FOUR SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS WERE BROUGHT UP ON REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES
A GIFT TO EMILY
HIS SIGHT MUCH THE SAME
YOU ARE WITHDRAWING FROM THE WORLD AS IT IS CALLED AND BRINGING WITH YOU--IF YOUR LETTERS ENABLE ME TO FORM A CORRECT JUDGMENT--A HEART AS UNSOPHISTICATED AS NATURAL AS TRUE AS THAT YOU CARRIED THERE
THE FAMILY WITH WHOM I HAVE NOW TO DO SHOT THEIR ROOTS DOWN DEEPER THAN I CAN PENETRATE
ON EVERY STEP OF THE STAIRS THERE WAS PLACED A ROLLER SPIKED WITH BARBED POINTS ALL ROUND SO AS TO IMPEDE THE ASCENT OF THE RIOTERS IF THEY SUCCEEDED IN FORCING THE DOORS
BUT SHE IS TO COME ON THE CONDITION THAT I FIRST GO AND STAY A FEW DAYS THERE
THE ELDEST SISTER RETURNING HOME TO THE TWO YOUNGER AFTER A FORTNIGHT'S ABSENCE
DID NOT KNOW ME
BUT NO REASONING PREVENTED HER SUFFERING MENTAL AGONY WHILE THE BODILY CAUSE REMAINED IN FORCE
IL LUI FAUT DU TEMPS POUR POUSSER VERS LE CIEL SES BRANCHES NOUEUSES ET POUR ENFONCER DANS LE SOL CES RACINES PROFONDES QUI S'ENCHEVETRENT DANS LES FONDEMENTS SOLIDES DE LA TERRE
PAPA AND BRANWELL ARE GONE FOR THE NEWSPAPER THE LEEDS INTELLIGENCER A MOST EXCELLENT TORY NEWSPAPER EDITED BY MR WOOD AND THE PROPRIETOR MR HENNEMAN
IT WAS ON EASTER DAY EITHER 1816 OR 1817
OH THOSE SIX MONTHS FROM THE TIME OF THE KING'S SPEECH TO THE END
AND THE EXPENSE OF THE LIQUORS--RUM OR ALE OR A MIXTURE OF BOTH CALLED DOG'S NOSE"--WAS GENERALLY DEFRAYED BY EACH GUEST PLACING SOME MONEY ON A PLATE SET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THERE EXISTED ON THIS GROUND A FIELD-KIRK OR ORATORY IN THE EARLIEST TIMES
I DESIRE IT ABOVE ALL THINGS
YET IT IS DREARY SOLITARY WORK
THE ROADS WERE SO NOTORIOUSLY BAD EVEN UP TO THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THAT THERE WAS LITTLE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ONE VILLAGE AND ANOTHER
IF I WERE TALKING TO YOU I COULD TELL YOU MUCH MORE TO EMILY ABOUT THIS TIME MINE BONNIE LOVE I WAS AS GLAD OF YOUR LETTER AS TONGUE CAN EXPRESS
AND WHEN OCCASION CALLED FOR AN EXPRESSION OF OPINION FROM CHARLOTTE BRONTE SHE WAS UNCOMPROMISING TRUTH
I HAVE SEEN MARY FREQUENTLY SINCE
AND MANY AN HOUR MUST HE HAVE SPENT PORING OVER THE MAP OF LONDON TO JUDGE FROM AN ANECDOTE WHICH HAS BEEN TOLD ME
DO NOT MISTAKE ME--DO NOT THINK I AM GOOD
SHE TOLD ME EARLY ONE MORNING THAT SHE HAD JUST BEEN DREAMING
THE FOLLOWING EXTRACTS FROM HER CORRESPONDENCE AT THIS TIME WILL SHOW HOW PAINFULLY THE RESTRAINT OF HER NEW MODE OF LIFE PRESSED UPON HER
AN INDISTINCT DREAD CAUSED PARTLY BY HIS OWN CONDUCT PARTLY BY EXPRESSIONS OF AGONISING SUSPICION IN ANNE'S LETTERS HOME WAS CREEPING OVER THEIR MINDS THAT HE MIGHT TURN OUT THEIR DEEP DISGRACE
ON SEEING THE RUINS OF THE TOWER OF BABEL
I WISH I COULD SAY ONE WORD TO YOU IN HIS FAVOUR BUT I CANNOT
I LOOK TO YOU AUNT TO HELP US
TWO OTHER DEAR FRIENDS THE ROSE AND JESSIE YORKE OF SHIRLEY LIVED STILL NEARER

VOUS APPRENDREZ SANS DOUTE AVEC PLAISIR QUE VOS ENFANTS ONT FAIT DU PROGRES TRESREMARQUABLE DANS TOUTES LES BRANCHES DE L'ENSEIGNENIENT ET QUE CES PROGRES SONT ENTIEREMENT DU A LEUR AMOUR POUR LE TRAVAIL ET A LEUR PERSEVERANCE
WHETHER THEY WOULD BE DISPOSED TO UNDERTAKE THE WORK AFTER HAVING OF COURSE BY DUE INSPECTION OF THE MS ASCERTAINED THAT ITS CONTENTS ARE SUCH AS TO WARRANT AN EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS
IN THE SAME SPIRIT THEY LABOURED TO DESIGN IMAGINATIONS OF THEIR OWN
THE NEXT DAY WE ADDED MANY OTHERS TO OUR LIST OF MEN TILL WE GOT ALMOST ALL THE CHIEF MEN OF THE KINGDOM
SOME OF THOSE GREAT WEST RIDING PARISHES ARE ALMOST LIKE BISHOPRICS FOR THEIR AMOUNT OF POPULATION AND NUMBER OF CHURCHES
VARNEY IS CERTAINLY THE PERSONIFICATION OF CONSUMMATE VILLAINY
THEY DECLARED THAT THE INFLICTION OF EVER SO SLIGHT A PUNISHMENT ON CHARLOTTE BRONTE WAS UNJUST--FOR WHO HAD TRIED TO DO HER DUTY LIKE HER?--AND TESTIFIED THEIR FEELING IN A VARIETY OF WAYS UNTIL MISS W WHO WAS IN REALITY ONLY TOO WILLING TO PASS OVER HER GOOD PUPIL'S FIRST FAULT WITHDREW THE BAD MARK
BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH IS THE RIGHT ONE
I LONG FOR MILD SOUTH AND WEST WINDS
ONE OF MY INFORMANTS IS AN OLD MAN WHO WAS THE LANDLORD OF THE INN AT THE TIME AND HE STANDS TO IT THAT SUCH WAS THE TEMPER OF THE IRRITATED MOB THAT MR REDHEAD WAS IN REAL DANGER OF HIS LIFE
I SHOULD VERY MUCH HAVE LIKED YOU TO HAVE SEEN HER
I DARE NOT TRUST ANY OTHER PERSON'S REPORT NO ONE SEEMS MINUTE ENOUGH IN THEIR OBSERVATIONS
HIS OWN YOUTH HAD BEEN SPENT AMONG PEOPLE OF THE SAME CONVENTIONAL RANK AS THOSE INTO WHOSE COMPANIONSHIP BRANWELL WAS NOW THROWN
THEY WERE EXPRESSLY GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUCH WAS THEIR DEPARTMENT
BUT THEY ARE LESS DEPENDENT ON HER THAN I AM
YET TO MY OWN ASTONISHMENT AT ONE WORD FROM HER I WAS PERFECTLY TRACTABLE
AYLOTT AND CO
AYLOTT AND CO
AYLOTT AND CO
AYLOTT AND CO
IN THE MORNINGS YOUNG BRONTE WOULD SAUNTER OUT SAYING WITH A DRUNKARD'S INCONTINENCE OF SPEECH THE POOR OLD MAN AND I HAVE HAD A TERRIBLE NIGHT OF IT
OF HER SHE HAD TAKEN CHARGE FROM HER INFANCY
MORE THAN ONCE AFTERWARDS SHE MENTIONED THE SERVICE I HAD DONE HER
HAPPILY SUCH OCCASION FOR THEIR ACTION HAS NOT OCCURRED FOR MANY YEARS
ON THE PRESUMPTION OF THIS FOOLISH CLAIM TO ANTIQUITY THE PEOPLE WOULD NEEDS SET UP FOR INDEPENDENCE AND CONTEST THE RIGHT OF THE VICAR OF BRADFORD TO NOMINATE A CURATE AT HAWORTH I HAVE GIVEN THIS EXTRACT IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THE IMAGINARY GROUNDWORK OF A COMMOTION WHICH TOOK PLACE IN HAWORTH ABOUT FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS AGO TO WHICH I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO ALLUDE AGAIN MORE PARTICULARLY
SHE WAS ALWAYS READY TO TRY AND DO WHAT THEY WISHED THOUGH NOT SORRY WHEN THEY CALLED HER AWKWARD AND LEFT HER OUT OF THEIR SPORTS
LIKE A FOOL I CRIED MOST BITTERLY
AFTER THE REFORMATION THE RIGHT OF CHOOSING THEIR CLERGYMAN AT ANY OF THOSE CHAPELS OF EASE WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN FIELD-KIRKS WAS VESTED IN THE FREEHOLDERS AND TRUSTEES SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE VICAR OF THE PARISH
HAVE YOU YET SEEN ANYTHING OF THE GREAT PERSONAGES WHOM THE SITTING OF PARLIAMENT NOW DETAINS IN LONDON--THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON SIR ROBERT PEEL EARL GREY MR STANLEY MR O'CONNELL
HE WALKED FIRST AMONG THE MOURNERS TO HER FUNERAL
AT THE FUNERAL OF MR CHARNOCK THE NEXT SUCCESSOR BUT ONE TO MR GRIMSHAW IN THE INCUMBENCY ABOVE EIGHTY PEOPLE WERE BID TO THE ARVILL AND THE PRICE OF THE FEAST WAS 4S
MARY T
FOR THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THE OFFER OF ANOTHER TO DO WHAT HE HAD BEEN SO LONG ACCUSTOMED TO DO FOR HIMSELF ONLY REMINDED HIM TOO PAINFULLY OF THE DEPRIVATION UNDER WHICH HE WAS SUFFERING
I AM SADLY INCONVENIENCED BY THE WANT OF THEM
IS A PLEASANT SPOT ONE OF THE OLD FAMILY HALLS OF ENGLAND SURROUNDED BY LAWN AND WOODLAND SPEAKING OF PAST TIMES AND SUGGESTING TO ME AT LEAST HAPPY FEELINGS
BUT IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS HAVING TAKEN THE UNPOPULAR SIDE EXAGGERATIONS OF HIS CHARACTER LINGER AS TRUTH IN THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE
OR CAN YOU STILL SEE IT DARK BLUE AND GREEN AND FOAM-WHITE AND HEAR IT ROARING ROUGHLY WHEN THE WIND IS HIGH OR RUSHING SOFTLY WHEN IT IS CALM
HIS STRONG PASSIONATE IRISH NATURE WAS IN GENERAL COMPRESSED DOWN WITH RESOLUTE STOICISM
AND I HAVE BEEN MOST ANXIOUS FOR US TO SELL OUR SHARES ERE IT BE TOO LATE AND TO SECURE THE PROCEEDS IN SOME SAFER IF FOR THE PRESENT LESS PROFITABLE INVESTMENT
AND TO BE TREATED IN THAT WAY MERELY BECAUSE I WAS SHY AND SOMETIMES MELANCHOLY WAS TOO BAD
44
THEY THEMSELVES ABOUNDED IN THOUGHT POWER AND INFORMATION
I CAN WELL IMAGINE THAT IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DECIDE FOR YOURSELF IN THIS MATTER SO I WILL DECIDE IT FOR YOU
AND ON THE WOMAN'S--GOD HELP HER IF SHE IS LEFT TO LOVE PASSIONATELY AND ALONE
SOME IS CERTAINLY OBJECTIONABLE
SHE HAD A HABIT OF WRITING IN ITALICS PRINTING CHARACTERS AND SAID SHE HAD LEARNT IT BY WRITING IN THEIR MAGAZINE
THE PLAY OF THE ISLANDERS WAS FORMED IN DECEMBER 1827 IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
THEIR ACCENT AND TONE OF SPEECH BLUNT AND HARSH
THEY ARE OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THE INFORMATION RESPECTING THE NUMBER OF COPIES SOLD ON JULY 23RD SHE WRITES TO THE MESSRS
AND OCCASIONALLY WHEN SHE HERSELF HAD ASSUMED THE POST OF ENGLISH TEACHER AND THE IMPERTINENCE OR INATTENTION OF HER PUPILS WAS MOST IRRITATING A SLIGHT INCREASE OF COLOUR A MOMENTARY SPARKLING OF THE EYE AND MORE DECIDED ENERGY OF MANNER WERE THE ONLY OUTWARD TOKENS SHE GAVE OF BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE ANNOYANCE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED
AND A FABULOUS STORY IS TOLD OF HIS FORBIDDING ANY ONE TO GIVE WATER TO THE WOUNDED LUDDITES LEFT IN THE MILL-YARD WHEN HE RODE IN THE NEXT MORNING TO CONGRATULATE HIS FRIEND CARTWRIGHT ON HIS SUCCESSFUL DEFENCE
A SEARCHING INVESTIGATION HAD TO BE MADE AND ENFORCED AND AS IT PROCEEDED STOUT AND STURDY UTTERANCES WERE NOT LACKING ON THE PART OF THE PARISHIONERS
THEN IF ALL BE WELL I WILL COME AND SEE YOU
THE DOG THAT LICKS MY HAND AND SITS BESIDE MY KNEE
THIS MAKES THEM INTERESTING AS A RACE
SUR LA MORT DE NAPOLEON
I HAD SOME FOND SUPERSTITIOUS HOPE THAT THE COLUMN DIVIDED THEIR FATES FROM HERS WHO STOOD APART IN THE CANVAS AS IN LIFE SHE SURVIVED
HIS PRACTICE WAS NOT HALF SO WILD OR EXTRAORDINARY AS THAT TO WHICH AN AUNT OF MINE WAS SUBJECTED BY A DISCIPLE OF MR DAY'S
I SUSPECT THEY KNEW AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE FOR ALL CONVERSATIONAL PURPOSES AS ANY ENGLISH GIRLS DO WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN ABROAD AND HAVE ONLY LEARNT THE IDIOMS AND PRONUNCIATION FROM AN ENGLISHWOMAN
ON THE LAST ROW IN THE QUIETEST CORNER SAT CHARLOTTE AND EMILY SIDE BY SIDE SO DEEPLY ABSORBED IN THEIR STUDIES AS TO BE INSENSIBLE TO ANY NOISE OR MOVEMENT AROUND THEM
NOW TO THAT FLATTERING SENTENCE MUST I TACK ON A LIST OF HER FAULTS
SHE WROTE THUS TO EMILY DEC.1ST 1843
SHE CONSIDERED ANY SLIGHT THROWN UPON HER CHURCH AS BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE HOLY TRUTH
THE DINING-ROOM WAS ON ONE SIDE OF THE DOOR AND FACED THE ROAD
THE FIRE WARMED THEM
WE NOTICED HOW CRITICS SOMETIMES USE FOR THEIR CHASTISEMENT THE WEAPON OF PERSONALITY AND FOR THEIR REWARD A FLATTERY WHICH IS NOT TRUE PRAISE
HERE THE WRITER IS REMINDED OF THE NECESSITY OF PRESERVING A CERTAIN VERISIMILITUDE
BUT THE PROPOSAL MENTIONED IN THE FOREGOING LETTER ALTERED THEIR PLANS
MY LOVE TO TABBY
HER MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME WAS CARNE
EMILY'S WAS A GRAVE-LOOKING FELLOW AND WE CALLED HIM GRAVEY ANNE'S WAS A QUEER LITTLE THING MUCH LIKE HERSELF AND WE CALLED HIM WAITING-BOY BRANWELL CHOSE HIS AND CALLED HIM BUONAPARTE THE FOREGOING EXTRACT SHOWS SOMETHING OF THE KIND OF READING IN WHICH THE LITTLE BRONTES WERE INTERESTED
SOMEHOW AND SOMETIME HE WOULD HAVE TO TURN TO HIS HOME AS A HIDING PLACE FOR SHAME
SELF-CONTAINED ALSO WAS SHE
YET I THINK I AM NEVER UNHAPPY
BUT THAT IN THE MIDST OF THIS DESOLATION THE PALACE OF THE CHIEF GENII SHALL RISE SPARKLING IN THE WILDERNESS AND THE HORRIBLE HOWL OF THEIR WAR-CRY SHALL SPREAD OVER THE LAND AT MORNING AT NOONTIDE AND NIGHT

THE POETASTER A DRAMA IN 2 VOLUMES JULY 12TH 1830
SHE SAID SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW PEOPLE COULD BEAR THE CONSTANT PRESSURE OF MISERY AND NEVER TO CHANGE EXCEPT TO A NEW FORM OF IT
NOTWITHSTANDING THAT BRUSSELS IS INDEED DESOLATE TO ME NOW
SOMETHING OF THIS MAY PROBABLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE FREEDOM OF MOUNTAIN AIR AND OF ISOLATED HILL-SIDE LIFE
I THINK I MUST PARTAKE OF THE NATURE OF A PIG OR AN ASS--BOTH WHICH ANIMALS ARE STRONGLY AFFECTED BY A HIGH WIND
JE N'AI PAS DE MAGNANIMITE DIT-ON
IT IS HOWEVER MY DUTY TO RESTRAIN THIS FEELING AT PRESENT AND I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO DO SO OF COURSE HER ABSENT SISTER AND BROTHER OBTAINED A HOLIDAY TO WELCOME HER RETURN HOME AND IN A FEW WEEKS SHE WAS SPARED TO PAY A VISIT TO HER FRIEND AT B
WHEN A BOOK WAS GIVEN HER SHE DROPPED HER HEAD OVER IT TILL HER NOSE NEARLY TOUCHED IT AND WHEN SHE WAS TOLD TO HOLD HER HEAD UP UP WENT THE BOOK AFTER IT STILL CLOSE TO HER NOSE SO THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO HELP LAUGHING THIS WAS THE FIRST IMPRESSION SHE MADE UPON ONE OF THOSE WHOSE DEAR AND VALUED FRIEND SHE WAS TO BECOME IN AFTER-LIFE
THE SPACIOUS SALOON--ONCE USED FOR THE ARCHDUCAL BALLS WHERE THE DARK GRAVE SPANIARDS MIXED WITH THE BLOND NOBILITY OF BRABANT AND FLANDERS--NOW A SCHOOLROOM FOR BELGIAN GIRLS
BUT AFTER HIS TIME I FEAR THERE WAS A FALLING BACK INTO THE WILD ROUGH HEATHEN WAYS FROM WHICH HE HAD PULLED THEM UP AS IT WERE BY THE PASSIONATE FORCE OF HIS INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER
IN 1840 HE WAS LIVING AT HOME EMPLOYING HIMSELF IN OCCASIONAL COMPOSITION OF VARIOUS KINDS AND WAITING TILL SOME OCCUPATION FOR WHICH HE MIGHT BE FITTED WITHOUT ANY EXPENSIVE COURSE OF PRELIMINARY TRAINING SHOULD TURN UP
I HAVE PUT THE CHILDREN TO BED
THERE'S A FREE AND EASY PROPOSAL
AND IF THE BRONTES UNDERTOOK IT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TRY AND WORK IT UP TO ITS FORMER STATE OF PROSPERITY
MR BRONTE'S OWN WORDS ON WHICH I GROUNDED MY STATEMENT AS TO THE TIME OF ANNE BRONTE'S BIRTH ARE AS FOLLOWS IN THORNTON CHARLOTTE PATRICK BRANWELL EMILY JANE AND ANNE WERE BORN AND SUCH OF THE INHABITANTS OF HAWORTH AS HAVE SPOKEN ON THE SUBJECT SAY THAT ALL THE CHILDREN OF MR AND MRS BRONTE WERE BORN BEFORE THEY REMOVED TO HAWORTH
WE HAVE NO MORE DIRECT INTERCOURSE WITH HER
IL NE REDOUTAIT PAS LE CHANT DES SIRENES--IL LE DEDAIGNAIT
A YEAR WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT
AND NEXT SHE KNOWING NOTHING OF THE WORLD BOTH FROM HER YOUTH AND HER ISOLATED POSITION HAS YET BEEN SO ACCUSTOMED TO HEAR HUMAN NATURE DISTRUSTED AS TO RECEIVE THE NOTION OF INTENSE AND ARTFUL VILLAINY WITHOUT SURPRISE
COMPLETED DEC
THE PICTURES IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS OF CHARACTER RECEIVED INTO THE MIND OF THE CHILD OF EIGHT YEARS OLD WERE DESTINED TO BE REPRODUCED IN FIERY WORDS A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AFTERWARDS
THERE IS A PAPER REMAINING WHICH CONTAINS MINUTE STUDIES OF AND CRITICISMS UPON THE ENGRAVINGS IN FRIENDSHIP'S OFFERING FOR 1829 SHOWING HOW SHE HAD EARLY FORMED THOSE HABITS OF CLOSE OBSERVATION AND PATIENT ANALYSIS OF CAUSE AND EFFECT WHICH SERVED SO WELL IN AFTER-LIFE AS HANDMAIDS TO HER GENIUS
MY DARLING IF I WERE LIKE YOU I SHOULD HAVE MY FACE ZION-WARD THOUGH PREJUDICE AND ERROR MIGHT OCCASIONALLY FLING A MIST OVER THE GLORIOUS VISION BEFORE ME--BUT I AM NOT LIKE YOU
HE IS NOW AS YOU KNOW GETTING OLD AND IT GRIEVES ME TO TELL YOU THAT HE IS LOSING HIS SIGHT
ONE MAY FANCY HOW REPULSIVE SUCH FARE WOULD BE TO CHILDREN WHOSE APPETITES WERE SMALL AND WHO HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO FOOD FAR SIMPLER PERHAPS BUT PREPARED WITH A DELICATE CLEANLINESS THAT MADE IT BOTH TEMPTING AND WHOLESOME
I WILL SKETCH OUT THE ORIGIN OF OUR PLAYS MORE EXPLICITLY IF I CAN
THERE MIGHT NOT BE MANY TO REGARD THE BRONTES WITH AFFECTION BUT THOSE WHO ONCE LOVED THEM LOVED THEM LONG AND WELL
IF THESE CHARITABLE PEOPLE KNEW THE TOTAL SECLUSION OF THE LIFE I LEAD,--THAT I NEVER EXCHANGE A WORD WITH ANY OTHER MAN THAN MONSIEUR HEGER AND SELDOM INDEED WITH HIM,--THEY WOULD PERHAPS CEASE TO SUPPOSE THAT ANY SUCH CHIMERICAL AND GROUNDLESS NOTION HAD INFLUENCED MY PROCEEDINGS
THE COUNTRY THE HOUSE AND THE GROUNDS ARE AS I HAVE SAID DIVINE
FOR YOU WILL REMEMBER IT WAS YOUR TURN
DEWSBURY MOOR IS RELINQUISHED
BUT AS YET I HAVE ONLY ASKED THE QUESTION
SHE HARDLY NEEDED TO HAVE ASKED THIS QUESTION
SCENE IN MY TUN A TALE
SICKNESS HARDSHIP DANGER ARE HER FELLOW TRAVELLERS--HER INSEPARABLE COMPANIONS
SHE BEHAVES SOMEWHAT MORE CIVILLY TO ME NOW THAN SHE DID AT FIRST AND THE CHILDREN ARE A LITTLE MORE MANAGEABLE
HE LOVED HER DEARLY EVER AFTER
AND IN LOOKING OVER THIS DEVOIR I WAS MUCH STRUCK WITH ONE OR TWO OF M
AND MR W
ELLES DISENT QU'ELLES SONT SUR QUE MADEMOISELLE E
THE HAWORTH CURATE BROUGHT HIS CLERICAL FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS ABOUT THE PLACE AND FOR A TIME THE INCURSIONS OF THESE NEAR THE PARSONAGE TEA-TIME FORMED OCCURRENCES BY WHICH THE QUIETNESS OF THE LIFE THERE WAS VARIED SOMETIMES PLEASANTLY SOMETIMES DISAGREEABLY
THERE WAS MUCH NEED OF SUCH AN INSTITUTION
THEY WERE GOOD LITTLE CREATURES
THROUGH MISS W---'S KIND CONSIDERATION ANNE WAS A YEAR LONGER AT SCHOOL THAN HER FRIENDS INTENDED
AND MADE HIMSELF BOTH RESPECTED AND DREADED BY HIS PUPILS
THE HOUSE IS OF GREY STONE TWO STORIES HIGH HEAVILY ROOFED WITH FLAGS IN ORDER TO RESIST THE WINDS THAT MIGHT STRIP OFF A LIGHTER COVERING
CONSCIOUS OF THE STRONG SAGACITY AND THE DOGGED POWER OF WILL WHICH SEEM ALMOST THE BIRTHRIGHT OF THE NATIVES OF THE WEST RIDING EACH MAN RELIES UPON HIMSELF AND SEEKS NO HELP AT THE HANDS OF HIS NEIGHBOUR
WHILE THERE ARE ALLUSIONS TO HOUSEHOLD OCCUPATIONS--SUCH AS MAKING THE WEDDING-CAKE
WHAT DO I CARE IT ENDED HOWEVER IN HIS SENDING ONE OF HIS SONS WHO THOUGH NOT BROUGHT UP TO THE SURGERING TRADE WAS ABLE TO DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY IN THE WAY OF BANDAGES AND PLASTERS
I CANNOT HOWEVER PERSUADE MY SISTERS TO REGARD THE AFFAIR PRECISELY FROM MY POINT OF VIEW
ANNE ARRIVED BEFORE CHRISTMAS-DAY
ALTHOUGH I HAVE DWELT ON THE EXCEPTIONAL TRAITS IN THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE STALWART WEST-RIDINGERS SUCH AS THEY WERE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS CENTURY IF NOT A FEW YEARS LATER I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT IN THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF THE PEOPLE SO INDEPENDENT WILFUL AND FULL OF GRIM HUMOUR THERE WOULD BE MUCH FOUND EVEN AT PRESENT THAT WOULD SHOCK THOSE ACCUSTOMED ONLY TO THE LOCAL MANNERS OF THE SOUTH
BESIDES I HAVE ANOTHER AND VERY EGOTISTICAL MOTIVE FOR BEING PLEASED
FROM WHAT QUARTER THE WIND BLOWS I CANNOT TELL FOR I NEVER COULD IN MY LIFE
DEGREE AND WAS ORDAINED TO A CURACY IN ESSEX WHENCE HE REMOVED INTO YORKSHIRE
HE DID NOT WHINE
BUT WHILE MARTHA WAS ILL SHE WAS TO HER MORE THAN A MOTHER--MORE THAN A SISTER
THIS IS OF COURSE A PERFECTLY CRUDE AND RANDOM IDEA
COMPLETED JULY 30TH 1830
YOU SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH AFRAID OF APPEARING COUNTRY-BRED
THEY WERE LARGE AND WELL SHAPED
AT THE TIME OF WHICH I WRITE THE FAVOURITE IDEA WAS THAT OF KEEPING A SCHOOL
AT THIS HOUSE THE T.'S AND THE BRONTES COULD LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING EACH OTHER PRETTY FREQUENTLY
HER INDEFATIGABLE CRAVING FOR KNOWLEDGE TEMPTED MISS W ON INTO SETTING HER LONGER AND LONGER TASKS OF READING FOR EXAMINATION
THESE LITTLE FACTS ALL TESTIFY TO THE OLD HEREDITARY SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE READY EVER TO RESIST AUTHORITY WHICH WAS CONCEIVED TO BE UNJUSTLY EXERCISED THAT DISTINGUISHES THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST RIDING TO THE PRESENT DAY
THESE ARE ADVANTAGES WHICH WOULD TURN TO REAL ACCOUNT WHEN WE ACTUALLY COMMENCED A SCHOOL
I KNOW YOU CAN SHE SAID SHE WOULD NOT
BUT THAT DOES NOT SIGNIFY
MAKE IT OUT
SHE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH THE CARE OF A LITTLE BOY THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD DURING THE ABSENCE OF HIS PARENTS ON A DAY'S EXCURSION AND PARTICULARLY ENJOINED TO KEEP HIM OUT OF THE STABLE YARD
MAIS SUR SON LIT DE MORT NAPOLEON EST SEUL
BEING LEFT A MOMENT ALONE THIS MORNING I PRAYED FERVENTLY TO BE ENABLED TO RESIGN MYSELF TO EVERY DECREE OF GOD'S WILL THOUGH IT SHOULD BE DEALT FORTH BY A FAR SEVERER HAND THAN THE PRESENT DISAPPOINTMENT
IN THE MEANTIME EMILY AND I ARE SUFFICIENTLY BUSY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
BUT THAT THEY SHALL HAVE THEIR ANNUAL FEAST OVER THE BONES OF THE DEAD AND SHALL YEARLY REJOICE WITH THE JOY OF VICTORS
IF ALL BE WELL I SHALL GO NEXT WEDNESDAY
WE SEE THE JOHN BULL IT IS A HIGH TORY VERY VIOLENT
SES YEUX LEVES SEMBLENT DIRE JE VOIS DIEU ET LES ANGES ET J'AI PERDU DE VUE LA TERRE DANS CE MOMENT LE MAIS CE PAUVRE HABIT FROC GRIS EST POUR LUI COMME LE MANTEAU D'ELIJAH
IF I COMPLAIN IN THIS LETTER HAVE MERCY AND DON'T BLAME ME FOR I FOREWARN YOU I AM IN LOW SPIRITS AND THAT EARTH AND HEAVEN ARE DREARY AND EMPTY TO ME AT THIS MOMENT
VISITING THEN WAS CONDUCTED DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT IT IS AT PRESENT
IN THE MEANTIME A LITTLE OCCURRENCE TOOK PLACE DESCRIBED IN ONE OF HER LETTERS WHICH I SHALL GIVE AS IT SHOWS HER INSTINCTIVE AVERSION TO A PARTICULAR CLASS OF MEN WHOSE VICES SOME HAVE SUPPOSED SHE LOOKED UPON WITH INDULGENCE
THE FOLLOWING STRANGE OCCURRENCE HAPPENED ON THE 22ND OF JUNE 1830:--AT THE TIME PAPA WAS VERY ILL CONFINED TO HIS BED AND SO WEAK THAT HE COULD NOT RISE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE
A GOOD OLD WOMAN WHO CAME TO NURSE MRS BRONTE IN THE ILLNESS--AN INTERNAL CANCER--WHICH GREW AND GATHERED UPON HER NOT MANY MONTHS AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT HAWORTH TELLS ME THAT AT THAT TIME THE SIX LITTLE CREATURES USED TO WALK OUT HAND IN HAND TOWARDS THE GLORIOUS WILD MOORS WHICH IN AFTER DAYS THEY LOVED SO PASSIONATELY
BUT FAR THE STRONGEST MOTIVE WITH CHARLOTTE WAS THE CONVICTION THAT ANNE'S HEALTH WAS SO DELICATE THAT IT REQUIRED A DEGREE OF TENDING WHICH NONE BUT HER SISTER COULD GIVE
AND WHILE HE WAS LYING IN A POOL OF BLOOD ON THE FLAG FLOOR AND CRYING OUT HOW MUCH HIS ARM WAS WARCHING HIS STOICAL RELATION STOOD COOLLY SMOKING HIS BIT OF BLACK PIPE AND UTTERED NOT A SINGLE WORD OF EITHER SYMPATHY OR SORROW
I THOUGHT I HAD DONE MY BEST--STRAINED EVERY NERVE TO PLEASE HER
ALTHOUGH TEN MILES FROM THE MOTHER CHURCH THEY WERE CALLED UPON TO DEFRAY A LARGE PROPORTION OF THIS OBNOXIOUS TAX,--I BELIEVE ONE FIFTH
IT IS ALLOWED ON ALL HANDS THAT THE SIN OF DANCING CONSISTS NOT IN THE MERE ACTION OF SHAKING THE SHANKS AS THE SCOTCH SAY BUT IN THE CONSEQUENCES THAT USUALLY ATTEND IT
THAT RECOLLECTION EXTENDS OVER MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS
THE CLASS OF CHRISTIAN NAMES PREVALENT IN A DISTRICT IS ONE INDICATION OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH ITS TIDE OF HERO-WORSHIP SETS
THEY WERE MOREOVER GRATEFUL TO HER FOR MANY HABITS SHE HAD ENFORCED UPON THEM AND WHICH IN TIME HAD BECOME SECOND NATURE
THEN UP AGAIN--ANYWHERE BUT TO THE PENSIONNAT--OUT TO THE CEMETERY WHERE MARTHA LAY--OUT BEYOND IT TO THE HILLS WHENCE THERE IS NOTHING TO BE SEEN BUT FIELDS AS FAR AS THE HORIZON
HE MINDS HIS OWN BUSINESS AND NE'ER TROUBLES HIMSELF WITH OURS MR BRONTE WAS FAITHFUL IN VISITING THE SICK AND ALL THOSE WHO SENT FOR HIM AND DILIGENT IN ATTENDANCE AT THE SCHOOLS
A RESPONSIBILITY WHICH APPROPRIATELY FELL TO HIM AS HE LIVED NEARER THE SCHOOL THAN ANY ONE ELSE WHO WAS INTERESTED IN IT
HER HEART TO THE LATEST DAY ON WHICH WE MET STILL BEAT WITH UNAVAILING INDIGNATION AT THE WORRYING AND THE CRUELTY TO WHICH HER GENTLE PATIENT DYING SISTER HAD BEEN SUBJECTED BY THIS WOMAN
THEY ARE FULL OF TENDER GRACE OF EXPRESSION AND FEMININE MODESTY
WE HAVE NO CONNECTIONS NO ACQUAINTANCES THERE
IN MEMORY OF MARIA WIFE OF THE REV

THEN THE PROFANE FUN GREW FAST AND FURIOUS
LEISURE HOURS A TALE AND TWO FRAGMENTS JULY 6TH 1829
THIS TEACHER A FRENCHWOMAN HAD ALWAYS BEEN UNCONGENIAL TO HER
SHE ANSWERED REASON WITH HIM AND WHEN HE WON'T LISTEN TO REASON WHIP HIM I ASKED BRANWELL WHAT WAS THE BEST WAY OF KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INTELLECTS OF MAN AND WOMAN
MR WILSON FELT MOST PROBABLY THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WHOLE PLAN RESTED UPON HIM
HAVING OPENED AND READ IT IT PROVED TO BE A DECLARATION OF ATTACHMENT AND PROPOSAL OF MATRIMONY EXPRESSED IN THE ARDENT LANGUAGE OF THE SAPIENT YOUNG IRISHMAN
SHE WOULD DIE WILLINGLY FOR ONE SHE LOVED
IL RAVIVE L'ESPERANCE ET LE COURAGE DANS TOUS CES CORPS EPUISES DE FATIGUES ET DE PRIVATIONS LA BATAILLE NE SERA LIVREE QUE DEMAIN MAIS LA VICTOIRE EST DECIDEE CE SOIR
TO COME TO THE POINT
I FIRST SAW HER COMING OUT OF A COVERED CART IN VERY OLD-FASHIONED CLOTHES AND LOOKING VERY COLD AND MISERABLE
12
IF HE PERCEIVED ANY ONE INATTENTIVE TO HIS PRAYERS HE WOULD STOP AND REBUKE THE OFFENDER AND NOT GO ON TILL HE SAW EVERY ONE ON THEIR KNEES
AND THUS THEY CAME TO OCCUPY THE OLD FOSSE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE GREAT ORCHARD OF THE HOSPITAL LYING TRANQUIL AND SUNNY IN THE HOLLOW BELOW THE RAMPART
MONSIEUR AND MADAME HEGER BEGIN TO RECOGNISE THE VALUABLE PARTS OF HER CHARACTER UNDER HER SINGULARITIES
AND THIS LED TO HIS PRESENCE BEING SOUGHT AT ARVILLS AND ALL THE GREAT VILLAGE GATHERINGS FOR THE YORKSHIREMEN HAVE A KEEN RELISH FOR INTELLECT
IT IS TRUE THAT HE HAD STRONG AND VEHEMENT PREJUDICES AND WAS OBSTINATE IN MAINTAINING THEM AND THAT HE WAS NOT DRAMATIC ENOUGH IN HIS PERCEPTIONS TO SEE HOW MISERABLE OTHERS MIGHT BE IN A LIFE THAT TO HIM WAS ALL-SUFFICIENT
I SHOULD NOT THINK OF GOING TO THE CHATEAU DE KOKLEBERG WHERE SHE IS RESIDENT AS THE TERMS ARE MUCH TOO HIGH
DID PAIN'S KEEN DART AND GRIEF'S SHARP STING STRIVE IN HIS MANGLED BREAST
IN 1831 SHE WAS A QUIET THOUGHTFUL GIRL OF NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE VERY SMALL IN FIGURE--"STUNTED WAS THE WORD SHE APPLIED TO HERSELF,--BUT AS HER LIMBS AND HEAD WERE IN JUST PROPORTION TO THE SLIGHT FRAGILE BODY NO WORD IN EVER SO SLIGHT A DEGREE SUGGESTIVE OF DEFORMITY COULD PROPERLY BE APPLIED TO HER
I SPECULATE MUCH ON THE EXISTENCE OF UNMARRIED AND NEVER-TO-BE-MARRIED WOMEN NOW-A-DAYS
I CAN HARDLY TELL YOU HOW TIME GETS ON AT HAWORTH
THE BUYING IN AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PROVISIONS RESTED WITH MR WILSON AND THE COOK
THE BEAUTY OF NATURE
AND AGAIN WE THINK OF THE GENTLE AND MELANCHOLY COWPER
WHILE AT CAMBRIDGE HE BECAME ONE OF A CORPS OF VOLUNTEERS WHO WERE THEN BEING CALLED OUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO RESIST THE APPREHENDED INVASION BY THE FRENCH
WHILST SMUGGLING WAS THE MEANS OF ACQUIRING WEALTH TO BOLD AND RECKLESS ADVENTURERS DRUNKENNESS AND DISSIPATION OCCASIONED THE RUIN OF MANY RESPECTABLE FAMILIES I HAVE GIVEN THIS EXTRACT BECAUSE I CONCEIVE IT BEARS SOME REFERENCE TO THE LIFE OF MISS BRONTE WHOSE STRONG MIND AND VIVID IMAGINATION MUST HAVE RECEIVED THEIR FIRST IMPRESSIONS EITHER FROM THE SERVANTS IN THAT SIMPLE HOUSEHOLD ALMOST FRIENDLY COMPANIONS DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY RETAILING THE TRADITIONS OR THE NEWS OF HAWORTH VILLAGE
THEY GAVE HIM A HEARTY WELCOME FOR THEY OWED HIM NO GRUDGE
HITHERTO THEY HAD NOT PROCEEDED TO ANYTHING LIKE PERSONAL VIOLENCE
I MAY STAY AT G UNTIL FRIDAY OR SATURDAY AND THE EARLY PART OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK I SHALL PASS WITH YOU IF YOU WILL HAVE ME--WHICH LAST SENTENCE INDEED IS NONSENSE FOR AS I SHALL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU SO I KNOW YOU WILL BE GLAD TO SEE ME
WHAT PUBLISHERS WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO RECEIVE FAVOURABLY A PROPOSAL OF THIS NATURE
AFTER THEIR APPRENTICESHIPS WERE FINISHED THE YOUNG MEN ALMOST INVARIABLY WENT TO LONDON TO PERFECT THEMSELVES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE TRADE OR ART
I HAVE HAD ONE LETTER FROM HER SINCE HER DEPARTURE WRITES CHARLOTTE ON OCTOBER 2ND 1836
AUNT--LIKE MANY OTHER ELDERLY PEOPLE--LIKES TO TALK OF SUCH THINGS
HIS HAIR AND COMPLEXION WERE SANDY
HEGER THE HUSBAND OF MADAME
I WOULD LAUGH AND SATIRIZE AND SAY WHATEVER CAME INTO MY HEAD FIRST
VOUS DECIDEREZ CE QU'IL FAUT FAIRE ET VOUS NOUS PARDONNEREZ NOTRE FRANCHISE SI VOUS DAIGNEZ CONSIDERER QUE LE MOTIF QUI NOUS FAIT AGIR EST UNE AFFECTION BIEN DESINTERESSEE ET QUI S'AFFLIGERAIT BEAUCOUP DE DEVOIR DEJA SE RESIGNER A N'ETRE PLUS UTILE A VOS CHERS ENFANTS
TO BE THE YOUNG AND ACTIVE MEMBER IN A HOUSEHOLD OF FOUR WHEREOF THREE--THE FATHER THE AUNT AND FAITHFUL TABBY--WERE PAST MIDDLE AGE
BUT THE CHILDREN BOTH BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAD BEEN PRESENT AND HONOURED HER FOR NOT TELLING TALES FROM THAT TIME SHE BEGAN TO OBTAIN INFLUENCE OVER ALL MORE OR LESS ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
YOU WILL NEVER WISH TO READ THEM OVER TWICE
SE DEROBE AU PANEGYRIQUE
I SUSPECT THIS SINGULAR CHRISTIAN NAME HAS BEEN MISTAKEN BY THE STONE-CUTTER FOR AUSTET A CONTRACTION OF EUSTATIUS BUT THE WORD TOD WHICH HAS BEEN MIS-READ FOR THE ARABIC FIGURES 600 IS PERFECTLY FAIR AND LEGIBLE
IS IT GROWN DIM IN YOUR MIND
THE MARQUIS OF DOURO AND LORD CHARLES WELLESLEY'S TALE TO HIS LITTLE KING AND QUEEN
WHILE HER DESCRIPTION OF ANY REAL OCCURRENCE IS AS WE HAVE SEEN HOMELY GRAPHIC AND FORCIBLE WHEN SHE GIVES WAY TO HER POWERS OF CREATION HER FANCY AND HER LANGUAGE ALIKE RUN RIOT SOMETIMES TO THE VERY BORDERS OF APPARENT DELIRIUM
QUE M'IMPORTE CE QU'ON DIT DE MOI
AUNT IS UPSTAIRS IN HER ROOM AND I AM SITTING BY THE TABLE WRITING THIS IN THE KITCHEN
SOME VAGUE SOME DEFINITE
I DO NOT DOUBT THE GENERAL ACCURACY OF MY INFORMANTS,--OF THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN AND SOLEMNLY REPEATED THE DETAILS THAT FOLLOW,--BUT IT IS ONLY JUST TO MISS BRONTE TO SAY THAT I HAVE STATED ABOVE PRETTY NEARLY ALL THAT I EVER HEARD ON THE SUBJECT FROM HER
OTHERS MAY HAVE NOTICED THIS THOUGH SHE DID NOT
INTERIOR OF A POTHOUSE A POEM
FOR INSTANCE ONE WOOLLEN MANUFACTURER SAYS THAT NOT FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS AGO HE HAD TO RISE BETIMES TO SET OFF ON A WINTER'S-MORNING IN ORDER TO BE AT BRADFORD WITH THE GREAT WAGGON-LOAD OF GOODS MANUFACTURED BY HIS FATHER
IT WOULD LAST THE HONEYMOON AND THEN PERHAPS GIVE PLACE TO DISGUST OR INDIFFERENCE WORSE PERHAPS THAN DISGUST
AT THE REQUEST OF HIS BROTHER--A CLERGYMAN LIVING NOT MANY MILES FROM HAWORTH AND AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MR BRONTE'S--SHE MADE MUCH INQUIRY AND AT LENGTH AFTER SOME DISCOURAGEMENT IN HER SEARCH HEARD OF A SCHOOL WHICH SEEMED IN EVERY RESPECT DESIRABLE
CHARLOTTE FIRST SAW LONDON IN THE DAY OR TWO THEY NOW STOPPED THERE
BRUSSELS IS A BEAUTIFUL CITY
AND YET IT FELT IRKSOME TO ACCEPT IT
IN DEFAULT OF TURBANED SARACENS THEY ENTERED ON A CRUSADE AGAINST METHODISTS IN BROADCLOTH
IN ANSWER TO HER CORRESPONDENT'S REPLY TO THIS LETTER SHE SAYS YOU THOUGHT I REFUSED YOU COLDLY DID YOU
CHARLOTTE WAS FREE FROM RELIGIOUS DEPRESSION WHEN IN TOLERABLE HEALTH
IT IS NOW SO DARK THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE SINGULAR PROPERTY OF SEEING IN THE NIGHT-TIME WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES AT ROE HEAD USED TO ATTRIBUTE TO ME I CAN SCRIBBLE NO LONGER TO A VISITOR AT THE PARSONAGE IT WAS A GREAT THING TO HAVE TABBY'S GOOD WORD
AND THAT BY ADOPTING IT THEY SHOULD LOSE ALL ORIGINALITY OF THOUGHT AND EXPRESSION
AND VERY WELCOME MESSENGERS THEY ARE ONE OF HER DAILY EMPLOYMENTS WAS TO READ TO HER FATHER AND IT REQUIRED A LITTLE GENTLE DIPLOMACY ON HER PART TO EFFECT THIS DUTY
COME THOU HIGH AND HOLY FEELING SHINE O'ER MOUNTAIN FLIT O'ER WAVE GLEAM LIKE LIGHT O'ER DOME AND SHIELDING THERE WERE EIGHT OR TEN MORE LINES WHICH I FORGET
THEY WEAR PLAIN STRAW COTTAGE BONNETS
AND IF HE WERE A CLEVER MAN AND LOVED ME THE WHOLE WORLD WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE AGAINST HIS SMALLEST WISH SHOULD BE LIGHT AS AIR SO THAT--HER FIRST PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE--WAS QUIETLY DECLINED AND PUT ON ONE SIDE
THE GREAT OLD CHURCHYARD LIES ABOVE ALL THE HOUSES AND IT IS TERRIBLE TO THINK HOW THE VERY WATER-SPRINGS OF THE PUMPS BELOW MUST BE POISONED
ABOVE ALL IT WAS TO HAVE THE POWER OF WATCHING OVER THESE TWO WHOSE LIFE AND HAPPINESS WERE EVER TO CHARLOTTE FAR MORE THAN HER OWN
I SOMETIMES THOUGHT THEY CONTRIBUTED TO THE MAGAZINES
BUT AT LAST THE POOR SOAKED FOLLOWER WAS FORCED TO YIELD AND RENOUNCE HIS BETTY
NEVER IMPATIENT
IN ORDER TO SHIELD THIS FRIEND HOWEVER FROM ANY BLAME OR MISCONSTRUCTION IT IS ONLY RIGHT TO STATE THAT BEFORE GRANTING ME THIS PRIVILEGE SHE THROUGHOUT MOST CAREFULLY AND COMPLETELY EFFACED THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS AND PLACES WHICH OCCURRED IN THEM
AINSI POUR PUNIR L'AMBITION RAPACE DE BUONAPARTE LA PROVIDENCE L'A ENCHAINE JUSQU'A CE QUE LA MORT S'EN SUIVIT SUR UN ROC ISOLE DE L'ATLANTIQUE
I GO ON CONSTANTLY SEEKING MY OWN PLEASURE PURSUING THE GRATIFICATION OF MY OWN DESIRES
HE WAS AN ENERGETIC MAN SPARING NO LABOUR FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HIS ENDS
AND SO HAWORTH RACES WERE STOPPED AND HAVE NEVER BEEN RESUMED TO THIS DAY
HEGER WHO HAD DONE LITTLE BUT OBSERVE DURING THE FEW FIRST WEEKS OF THEIR RESIDENCE IN THE RUE D'ISABELLE PERCEIVED THAT WITH THEIR UNUSUAL CHARACTERS AND EXTRAORDINARY TALENTS A DIFFERENT MODE MUST BE ADOPTED FROM THAT IN WHICH HE GENERALLY TAUGHT FRENCH TO ENGLISH GIRLS
OF THE MUTTERED THREATS OF INDIVIDUALS TOO CLOSELY PRESSED UPON BY NECESSITY TO BE PRUDENT
ALTHOUGH THEY NEVER ATTAINED TO ANYTHING LIKE PROFICIENCY THEY TOOK GREAT INTEREST IN ACQUIRING THIS ART
BUT IT WAS TO BE OBTAINED ONLY BY SHRINKING FROM WHAT SHE ESTEEMED RIGHT AND THAT SHE NEVER DID WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE SACRIFICE
AND NOW MADAM GOD BLESS YOU
IN AFTER YEARS THIS WAS THE TIME FOR DISCUSSING TOGETHER THE PLOTS OF THEIR NOVELS
I HAVE FELT FOR SOME MONTHS THAT I OUGHT NOT TO BE AWAY FROM HIM
TO AN INSTANCE OR TWO MORE OF THE RUSTICITY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE CHAPELRY OF HAWORTH I MAY INTRODUCE YOU
SHE SPOKE OF NEW PEOPLE AND CHARACTERS AND FOREIGN WAYS OF THE PUPILS AND TEACHERS
NO SHAMS TOLERATED
BUT SHE DECLINED THIS SAYING THAT SHE WOULD RATHER ENFORCE DISCIPLINE BY HER OWN MANNER AND CHARACTER THAN BE INDEBTED FOR OBEDIENCE TO THE PRESENCE OF A GENDARME
AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE M
THEY REMONSTRATED PRETTY SHARPLY WITH HIM BUT HE BELIEVED THAT HIS CONDUCT WAS RIGHT AND PERSEVERED IN IT
NO YOU NEVER SAW IT
WHERE'S THE USE OF PROTESTATIONS
WALK OUT OFTEN ON THE MOORS
BUT MISS WOOLER SAYS I MUST GO TO MARY NEXT FRIDAY AS SHE PROMISED FOR ME ON WHIT-SUNDAY
THERE WAS AN ENGLISH LADY WHO HAD LONG LIVED IN THE ORLEANS FAMILY AMIDST THE VARIOUS FLUCTUATIONS OF THEIR FORTUNES AND WHO WHEN THE PRINCESS LOUISE WAS MARRIED TO KING LEOPOLD ACCOMPANIED HER TO BRUSSELS IN THE CAPACITY OF READER
I AM SORRY TO SAY ANNE HAS TAKEN A LITTLE COLD IN CONSEQUENCE BUT I HOPE SHE WILL SOON BE WELL
IF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER OF THE BELGIANS IS TO BE MEASURED BY THE CHARACTER OF MOST OF THE GIRLS IS THIS SCHOOL IT IN A CHARACTER SINGULARLY COLD SELFISH ANIMAL AND INFERIOR
THE SERVANTS--TWO AFFECTIONATE WARM-HEARTED SISTERS WHO CANNOT NOW SPEAK OF THE FAMILY WITHOUT TEARS--CALLED THE ROOM THE CHILDREN'S STUDY THE AGE OF THE ELDEST STUDENT WAS PERHAPS BY THIS TIME SEVEN
WHAT OF THAT
YOU REMEMBER THE LETTER SHE WROTE ME WHEN I WAS IN ENGLAND
SHE WENT BACK TO HER WORK AND MADE NO COMPLAINT HOPING TO SUBDUE THE WEAKNESS THAT WAS GAINING GROUND UPON HER
SHE ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN THIS POINTING OUT THE SHADOWS THE PEEPS OF SKY C
BUT IN A GIRL ONLY JUST ENTERED ON HER TEENS SUCH AN EXPRESSION WOULD BE CALLED TO USE A COUNTRY PHRASE OLD-FASHIONED AND IN 1831 THE PERIOD OF WHICH I NOW WRITE WE MUST THINK OF HER AS A LITTLE SET ANTIQUATED GIRL VERY QUIET IN MANNERS AND VERY QUAINT IN DRESS
FOR HER ILL HEALTH WAS INCREASING AND THE OLD COUGH THE REMAINS OF THE HOOPING-COUGH LINGERED ABOUT HER
I HAVE HEARD FROM TWO WITNESSES BESIDES CHARLOTTE BRONTE THAT DR BATTY CONDEMNED THE PREPARATION OF THE FOOD BY THE EXPRESSIVE ACTION OF SPITTING OUT A PORTION OF IT
ONE DAUGHTER WAS NEEDED AT HOME TO STAY WITH MR BRONTE AND MISS BRANWELL
NEXT TO HER NEPHEW THE DOCILE PENSIVE ANNE WAS HER FAVOURITE
SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER PLAYED AND COULD NOT PLAY
3RD VOL.:--1
WOULD IT SUFFICE TO WRITE TO A PUBLISHER ON THE SUBJECT OR WOULD IT BE NECESSARY TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A PERSONAL INTERVIEW
ANOTHER THREE WEEKS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE I SHALL AGAIN HAVE MY COMFORTER BESIDE ME UNDER THE ROOF OF MY OWN DEAR QUIET HOME
ABOVE ALL IN OUR GREY HALF-INHABITED HOUSE
AND I ARE ON VERY AMIABLE TERMS
MISS W CONSIDERED IT AS LITTLE MORE THAN A COMMON COLD
ANNE'S PLANS FOR THE INTERVAL WERE FIXED
IF ANYTHING WOULD CHEER ME IT IS THE IDEA OF BEING SO NEAR YOU
ON ANOTHER TABLET BELOW THE FIRST THE FOLLOWING RECORD HAS BEEN ADDED TO THAT MOURNFUL LIST ADJOINING LIE THE REMAINS OF CHARLOTTE WIFE OF THE REV
FOR A COMPANION
I SHALL ENDEAVOUR THEREFORE BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER WITH MY WORK TO PRESENT SOME IDEA OF THE CHARACTER OF THE PEOPLE OF HAWORTH AND THE SURROUNDING DISTRICTS
ON THEIR DECLARING THEY WOULD HE HAD THE LARGE PEW WHICH THEY USUALLY OCCUPIED LOCKED
DO NOT TOO HARSHLY REPRESS SENTIMENTS AND FEELINGS EXCELLENT IN THEMSELVES BECAUSE YOU FEAR THAT SOME PUPPY MAY FANCY THAT YOU ARE LETTING THEM COME OUT TO FASCINATE HIM
MISS BRONTE MORE THAN ONCE SAID TO ME THAT SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN WHAT SHE DID OF LOWOOD IN JANE EYRE IF SHE HAD THOUGHT THE PLACE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED WITH COWAN BRIDGE ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOT A WORD IN HER ACCOUNT OF THE INSTITUTION BUT WHAT WAS TRUE AT THE TIME WHEN SHE KNEW IT
TO WORK
ORDER METHOD NEATNESS IN EVERYTHING
SHE WAS MARRIED FROM HER UNCLE'S HOUSE IN YORKSHIRE ON THE 29TH OF DECEMBER 1812
MR CARTWRIGHT'S CONDUCT WAS SO MUCH ADMIRED BY THE NEIGHBOURING MILL-OWNERS THAT THEY ENTERED INTO A SUBSCRIPTION FOR HIS BENEFIT WHICH AMOUNTED IN THE END TO 3,000_L
MOSES MIGHT FROM HIS ELEVATION SEE MOUNTAINS AND PLAINS GROUPS OF MAIDENS AND HERDS OF CATTLE BUT COULD HARDLY PERCEIVE THE DETAILS OF DRESS OR THE ORNAMENTS OF THE HEAD
THE CARNIVAL IS JUST OVER AND WE HAVE ENTERED UPON THE GLOOM AND ABSTINENCE OF LENT
MAHOMET N'AVAIT JAMAIS REMUE LES MOLLES NATIONS DE L'ORIENT COMME ALORS PIERRE REMUA LES PEUPLES AUSTERES DE L'OCCIDENT
HAS LEFT BRUSSELS I HAVE NOBODY TO SPEAK TO FOR I COUNT THE BELGIANS AS NOTHING
WHERE THEY WERE DIFFERENT HE WOULD MAKE THEM SEEK THE ORIGIN OF THAT DIFFERENCE BY CAUSING THEM TO EXAMINE WELL INTO THE CHARACTER AND POSITION OF EACH SEPARATE WRITER AND HOW THEY WOULD BE LIKELY TO AFFECT HIS CONCEPTION OF TRUTH
BY THIS TIME YOU HAVE ACQUIRED POLISH ENOUGH I AM SURE
BUT CHARLOTTE FELT EVERY INDICATION OF INCIPIENT CONSUMPTION AS A STAB AT HER HEART REMEMBERING MARIA AND ELIZABETH WHOSE PLACES ONCE KNEW THEM AND SHOULD KNOW THEM NO MORE
AND MINE SHALL BE GUERNSEY WE THEN CHOSE WHO SHOULD BE CHIEF MEN IN OUR ISLANDS
20TH 1845
BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS I ADMIRED THE NOBLE INTEGRITY WHICH COULD DICTATE SO FEARLESS AN OPPOSITION AGAINST SO STRONG AN ANTAGONIST
I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED AT THIS LETTER
ALSO TO EMPLOY EMILY SOME PART OF EACH DAY IN TEACHING MUSIC TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THE PUPILS
BUT NEITHER THEN NOR AFTERWARDS DID SHE EVER SPEAK TO HER OF THE PUBLICATION OF THE POEMS
ONCE GOING AS TEACHER TO A SCHOOL IN HALIFAX FOR SIX MONTHS AND AFTERWARDS ACCOMPANYING CHARLOTTE TO BRUSSELS FOR TEN
YET IT IS WRONG AND FOOLISH TO REPINE
SO SHE FOUND THAT ALL HER FRIENDS MIGHT FREELY VISIT HER AND THAT HER FATHER WOULD BE RECEIVED WITH ESPECIAL GLADNESS
THE SECOND GIVES AS RATHER SHABBY ACCORDING TO THE NOTION OF THE TIMES 1673 NOTHING BUT A BIT OF CAKE DRAUGHT OF WINE PIECE OF ROSEMARY AND PAIR OF GLOVES BUT THE ARVILLS AT HAWORTH WERE OFTEN FAR MORE JOVIAL DOINGS
CHARLOTTE HAD RETAINED HER SKILL IN THE LANGUAGE BY THE HABIT OF WHICH SHE THUS SPEAKS TO M
CHACUNE D'ELLES ACQUERAIT A LA FOIS ET L'INSTRUCTION ET LA SCIENCE D'ENSEIGNEMENT
OF COURSE WHEN I COME YOU WILL LET ME ENJOY YOUR OWN COMPANY IN PEACE AND NOT DRAG ME OUT A VISITING
UNDER NO GREAT TEMPTATION TO CRIME BUT DAILY GIVING WAY TO SELFISHNESS AND ILL-TEMPER TILL ITS CONDUCT TOWARDS THOSE DEPENDENT ON IT SOMETIMES AMOUNTS TO A TYRANNY OF WHICH ONE WOULD RATHER BE THE VICTIM THAN THE INFLICTER
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE REACH OF THESE S
ON APRIL 20TH SHE WRITES TO DESIRE THAT THREE COPIES MAY BE SENT TO HER AND THAT MESSRS
BUT SHE WAS FAR FROM WELL OR STRONG AND THE SHORT JOURNEY OF FOURTEEN MILES SEEMS TO HAVE FATIGUED HER GREATLY
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE COURSE POLITICS ARE TAKING
HEGER'S COMMENTS ARE GIVEN IN AT APPROXIMATELY THE PLACE WHERE THEY OCCUR--DP
AND FOR A CORRECT EXEMPLIFICATION OF THE FORM IN WHICH THE LATTER FREQUENTLY APPEARS I NEED ONLY REFER THE READER OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS TO THE CHARACTER OF JOSEPH FROM THE SAME CAUSE COME ALSO ENDURING GRUDGES IN SOME CASES AMOUNTING TO HATRED WHICH OCCASIONALLY HAS BEEN BEQUEATHED FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
I KNOW THESE FEELINGS ARE ABSURD AND THEREFORE I TRY TO HIDE THEM BUT THEY ONLY STING THE DEEPER FOR CONCEALMENT COMPARE THIS STATE OF MIND WITH THE GENTLE RESIGNATION WITH WHICH SHE HAD SUBMITTED TO BE PUT ASIDE AS USELESS OR TOLD OF HER UGLINESS BY HER SCHOOL-FELLOWS ONLY THREE YEARS BEFORE
IL VOIT JERUSALEM DELIVREE
AT THIS BLESSED MOMENT WE HAVE NO LESS THAN THREE OF THEM IN HAWORTH PARISH--AND THERE IS NOT ONE TO MEND ANOTHER
IT IS WHAT I NEVER RECEIVED BEFORE--IT IS THE UNRESTRAINED POURING OUT OF A WARM GENTLE GENEROUS HEART I THANK YOU WITH ENERGY FOR THIS KINDNESS
THIS IS NOT LIKE ONE OF MY ADVENTURES IS IT
HIS SIGHT DIMINISHES WEEKLY
SOMETHING MUST BE DONE
OF WRITING FOR THE LOVE OF FAME
IT CALLED INTO PLAY HER POWERS OF ANALYSIS WHICH WERE EXTRAORDINARY AND SHE VERY SOON EXCELLED IN IT
I DO NOT EXPECT THAT SHE WILL SEND ME ANY OF HER CHILDREN BUT IF SHE WOULD I DARE SAY SHE COULD RECOMMEND ME OTHER PUPILS
BY KNOWLEDGE TASTE AND VOICE THEY WERE MARKEDLY SEPARATE FROM ORDINARY VILLAGE CHOIRS AND HAVE BEEN PUT IN EXTENSIVE REQUISITION FOR THE SOLO AND CHORUS OF MANY AN IMPOSING FESTIVAL
BUT ALACK-A-DAY
I YIELD RELUCTANTLY I FANCY THAT ABOUT THIS TIME MR BRONTE FOUND IT NECESSARY EITHER FROM FAILING HEALTH OR THE INCREASED POPULOUSNESS OF THE PARISH TO ENGAGE THE ASSISTANCE OF A CURATE
FOR INSTANCE TAKE CROMWELL
I FEEL AS IF I COULD NOT
I CAN'T TELL WHAT SHOULD INDUCE YOU AND YOUR SISTERS TO WASTE YOUR KINDNESS ON SUCH A ONE AS ME
EMILY IS IN THE PARLOUR BRUSHING THE CARPET
IN MY OPINION ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING WORKS THAT EVER EMANATED FROM THE GREAT SIR WALTER'S PEN
HE HAS SEEN EAGLES STOOPING LOW IN SEARCH OF FOOD FOR THEIR YOUNG
AND THIS DEEPLY DISPLEASED THE WORKPEOPLE WHO WERE TO BE INTIMIDATED BY THE RED-COATS
AND THE DOORS WERE STRONGLY BARRICADED AT NIGHT
QUELQUEFOIS C'EST UN CONQUERANT UN ALEXANDRE OU UN ATTILA QUI PASSE COMME UN OURAGAN ET PURIFIE L'ATMOSPHERE MORAL COMME L'ORAGE PURIFIE L'ATMOSPHERE PHYSIQUE
BUT DEFICIENT IN THE DIGNITY AND DISCRETION OF AN ENGLISHMAN
THE TEACHERS WOULD OF COURSE BE UNWILLING TO LAY ANY COMPLAINTS ON THE SUBJECT BEFORE HIM
BUT THIS IMPROVEMENT COULD NOT BE GREAT WHEN IT COULD ONLY AMOUNT TO A GREATER FAMILIARITY WITH DICTIONARY WORDS AND WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT A VERBAL TRANSLATION OF ENGLISH IDIOMS HARDLY CONSTITUTED FRENCH COMPOSITION
MAGNAE GULDAE REGINA GULDAE FRATRIBUS POSUIT
ELDERLY WOMEN RESIDING IN BRADFORD
THOUGH I MAY BE BUT AN UNGRACIOUS ADVISER YOU WILL ALLOW ME THEREFORE TO SUBSCRIBE MYSELF WITH THE BEST WISHES FOR YOUR HAPPINESS HERE AND HEREAFTER YOUR TRUE FRIEND ROBERT SOUTHEY I WAS WITH MISS BRONTE WHEN SHE RECEIVED MR CUTHBERT SOUTHEY'S NOTE REQUESTING HER PERMISSION TO INSERT THE FOREGOING LETTER IN HIS FATHER'S LIFE
COWPER'S POEM THE CASTAWAY WAS KNOWN TO THEM ALL AND THEY ALL AT TIMES APPRECIATED OR ALMOST APPROPRIATED IT
HE USED TO PREACH TWENTY OR THIRTY TIMES A WEEK IN PRIVATE HOUSES
AFTER WHICH HE RESTORED IT TO THE GUILD TO BE AGAIN STRIVEN FOR
THE USE OF PATRONYMICS HAS BEEN COMMON IN THIS LOCALITY
I COULD NOT AT THAT TIME HAVE PERSEVERED IN MY INTENTION WITHOUT EXCITING HIM TO ANGER
QUE LA TRAHISON SE TAISE
THE OLD CUSTOM OF ARVILLS WAS AS PREVALENT AS EVER
INDEED IT HAD NOT THE COMFORT OF A FIRE-PLACE IN IT
AND IN THE SECOND PLACE IF IT DID THE FEELING WOULD BE ONLY TEMPORARY
TO OBVIATE THIS PUBLICATION OF WHAT IT MIGHT BE DESIRABLE TO KEEP SECRET MISS BRONTE USED TO TAKE HER OUT FOR A WALK ON THE SOLITARY MOORS
THE GIRLS WERE HARDLY STRANGERS TO HER SOME OF THEM BEING YOUNGER SISTERS OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN HER OWN PLAYMATES
AND FROM THE ARCHBISHOP'S REGISTRY AT YORK IT IS ASCERTAINED THAT THERE WAS A CHAPEL AT HAWORTH IN 1317
I HAVE HEARD THAT MISS BRANWELL ALWAYS WENT ABOUT THE HOUSE IN PATTENS CLICKING UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS FROM HER DREAD OF CATCHING COLD
INDEED THAT MADE BY THE PARENTS WAS CONSIDERED TO BE EXCLUSIVELY APPROPRIATED TO THE EXPENSES OF LODGING AND BOARDING AND THE EDUCATION PROVIDED FOR BY THE SUBSCRIPTIONS
AND THE GIRLS TALKED OF THE LITTLE WORLD AROUND THEM AS IF IT WERE THE ONLY WORLD THAT WAS
I DO NOT THINK SHE LIKES ME AT ALL BECAUSE I CAN'T HELP BEING SHY IN SUCH AN ENTIRELY NOVEL SCENE SURROUNDED AS I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN BY STRANGE AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING FACES I USED TO THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO BE IN THE STIR OF GRAND FOLKS SOCIETY
BUT THE PERSON TO WHOM SHE ADDRESSED THIS ONE HAD EVIDENTLY CONFINED HIMSELF TO PURELY LITERARY CRITICISMS BESIDES WHICH HER SENSE OF HUMOUR WAS TICKLED BY THE PERPLEXITY WHICH HER CORRESPONDENT FELT AS TO WHETHER HE WAS ADDRESSING A MAN OR A WOMAN
OF THE HABITS AND WAYS OF LIFE THERE
NOT ONLY OF DEAD BODIES OR DYING PEOPLE
SHE WAS REMARKABLY NEAT IN HER WHOLE PERSONAL ATTIRE
I AM SAD--VERY SAD--AT THE THOUGHTS OF LEAVING HOME
AND I DO SO WISH TO GO HOME
SHE PICKED UP EVERY SCRAP OF INFORMATION CONCERNING PAINTING SCULPTURE POETRY MUSIC C AS IF IT WERE GOLD WHAT I HAVE HEARD OF HER SCHOOL DAYS FROM OTHER SOURCES CONFIRMS THE ACCURACY OF THE DETAILS IN THIS REMARKABLE LETTER
BUT M
SO FAR FROM IT THAT MY SISTERS WHO ARE MANY YEARS OLDER THAN MYSELF AND EVEN MY DEAR MOTHER USED TO CONSULT ME ON EVERY OCCASION OF IMPORTANCE AND SCARCELY EVER DOUBTED THE PROPRIETY OF MY OPINIONS AND ACTIONS
ONE NIGHT ABOUT THE TIME WHEN THE COLD SLEET AND STORMY FOGS OF NOVEMBER ARE SUCCEEDED BY THE SNOW-STORMS AND HIGH PIERCING NIGHT WINDS OF CONFIRMED WINTER WE WERE ALL SITTING ROUND THE WARM BLAZING KITCHEN FIRE HAVING JUST CONCLUDED A QUARREL WITH TABBY CONCERNING THE PROPRIETY OF LIGHTING A CANDLE FROM WHICH SHE CAME OFF VICTORIOUS NO CANDLE HAVING BEEN PRODUCED
BUT HE HAD HAD A STRONG WILL AND AN EARNEST AND PERSEVERING AMBITION AND A RESOLUTENESS OF PURPOSE WHICH HIS WEAKER SON WANTED
MRS CARTWRIGHT KNEW WHAT THEY HAD THREATENED
SHE EXPRESSES HERSELF VERY WELL SATISFIED AND SAYS THAT MRS
BUT STILL THE NEIGHBOURS THOUGH THEY SUBSIST BY A DIFFERENT STATE OF THINGS REMEMBER THAT THEIR FOREFATHERS LIVED IN AGRICULTURAL DEPENDENCE UPON THE OWNERS OF THESE HALLS
THE LETTER FROM WHICH I HAVE TAKEN THE ABOVE EXTRACT RELATES THROUGHOUT TO THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE PLACE WHERE CHARLOTTE BRONTE SPENT HER SCHOOL-DAYS AND DESCRIBES THINGS AS THEY EXISTED AT THAT VERY TIME
HAWORTH JUNE 9 1838
HER REPLY WAS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE NOR ANY ONE LIKE HIM
PROPOUND THE QUESTION TO YOUR SISTER IF YOU THINK SHE CAN ANSWER IT
RATTEN'S ATTEMPT
IF YOU DO I'LL SEND UP FOR PATRICK SO THE VILLAGERS CALLED HIM TILL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH THOUGH IN HIS OWN FAMILY HE WAS ALWAYS BRANWELL AND WHILE THE MESSENGER WENT THE LANDLORD ENTERTAINED HIS GUEST WITH ACCOUNTS OF THE WONDERFUL TALENTS OF THE BOY WHOSE PRECOCIOUS CLEVERNESS AND GREAT CONVERSATIONAL POWERS WERE THE PRIDE OF THE VILLAGE


HE WAS FULL OF NOBLE IMPULSES AS WELL AS OF EXTRAORDINARY GIFTS
THEY WERE WEALTHY PEOPLE AND KIND HEARTED BUT HER FOOD AND CLOTHING WERE OF THE VERY SIMPLEST AND RUDEST DESCRIPTION ON SPARTAN PRINCIPLES
I HAVE BEEN EVERY WEEK SINCE I CAME HOME EXPECTING TO SEE BRANWELL AND HE HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET OVER YET
IF YOU CAN ONLY STOP AN HOUR COME
THE BARBAROUS PEACH-COLOURED DRAWING-ROOM
MAY THE ALMIGHTY HEAR ME COMPASSIONATELY
THIS IS TRUE
THE STRONGER SELF-DENYING WILL FORBADE
NOT PRETTY BUT VERY ELEGANT AND ALWAYS DRESSED WITH A QUIET SIMPLICITY OF TASTE WHICH ACCORDED WELL WITH HER GENERAL CHARACTER AND OF WHICH SOME OF THE DETAILS CALL TO MIND THE STYLE OF DRESS PREFERRED BY HER DAUGHTER FOR HER FAVOURITE HEROINES
HE DID NOT ACT FROM PRINCIPLE LIKE THE REST BUT FROM EXPEDIENCY
IF ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE REQUIRED AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE OF 3_L
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP ONE'S NATURAL FEELINGS
I FELT WHAT I SAID AT THE TIME AND I REPEAT IT NOW WITH DOUBLE EARNESTNESS
BUT SHE WOULD SPARE NO DEEDS IN THE CAUSE OF THOSE WHOM SHE KINDLY REGARDED
HE'D THREAP YO DOWN TH LOAN
I OUGHT TO BE AT DEWSBURY MOOR YOU KNOW
LADY ANNE ACCORDING TO TRADITION HAVING BEEN WORRIED AND EATEN BY WOLVES AS SHE SAT AT THE WELL TO WHICH THE INDIGO-DYED FACTORY PEOPLE FROM BIRSTALL AND BATLEY WOOLLEN MILLS WOULD FORMERLY REPAIR ON PALM SUNDAY WHEN THE WATERS POSSESS REMARKABLE MEDICINAL EFFICACY
AND BELIEVE ME SIR WITH DEEP RESPECT YOUR REALLY HUMBLE SERVANT P
SHE ALWAYS SHOWED PHYSICAL FEEBLENESS IN EVERYTHING
THE CURRENT OF THE STREAM IS INTERRUPTED BY BROKEN PIECES OF GREY ROCK
SHE TOLD ME THAT ONE NIGHT SITTING ALONE ABOUT THIS TIME SHE HEARD A VOICE REPEAT THESE LINES
I SEE EVERYTHING COULEUR DE ROSE AND AM STRONGLY INCLINED TO DANCE A JIG IF I KNEW HOW
BRANWELL CHOSE JOHN BULL ASTLEY COOPER AND LEIGH HUNT
STILL PATIENT CHEERFUL AND PIOUS
EMILY IS GOING TO SCHOOL BRANWELL IS GOING TO LONDON AND I AM GOING TO BE A GOVERNESS
SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP RATHER IN A SCHOOL OF SPARTAN ENDURANCE THAN IN ONE OF MAUDLIN SELF-INDULGENCE AND COULD BEAR MANY A PAIN AND RELINQUISH MANY A HOPE IN SILENCE
SHE HAD A REMARKABLE KNACK OF MAKING THEM FEEL INTERESTED IN WHATEVER THEY HAD TO LEARN
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAD ANY OF US SEEN HIM BUT HOWEVER AFTER THE MANNER OF HIS COUNTRYMEN HE SOON MADE HIMSELF AT HOME
AND THE COTTAGES HAVING HAD A LITTLE EXTRA PAINT AND WHITE-WASHING ASSUMED QUITE A HOLIDAY LOOK
IF HER TRUST IN GOD HAD BEEN LESS STRONG SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WAY TO UNBOUNDED ANXIETY AT MANY A PERIOD OF HER LIFE
I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO REFUSE AND IT IS STILL MORE EMBARRASSING TO ACCEPT
AND AS OUR NUMBER MUST BE LIMITED WE CAN DEVOTE A LARGE SHARE OF TIME AND PAINS TO EACH PUPIL
BRUSSELS AUGUST 1ST 1843
THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON THEIR DEMI-GOD
THE ELDER ONES TAKING THOUGHTFUL CARE FOR THE TODDLING WEE THINGS
ON THE SIDE OF THE COLUMN WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY THE SUN STOOD CHARLOTTE IN THE WOMANLY DRESS OF THAT DAY OF GIGOT SLEEVES AND LARGE COLLARS
C'EST UN LION ROYAL AUPRES DE QUI VOUS N'ETES QUE DES CHACALS
THERE IS A PROJECT HATCHING IN THIS HOUSE WHICH BOTH EMILY AND I ANXIOUSLY WISHED TO DISCUSS WITH YOU
LIBERTY WAS THE BREATH OF EMILY'S NOSTRILS
THIS AUNT WAS OLDER THAN MRS BRONTE AND HAD LIVED LONGER AMONG THE PENZANCE SOCIETY WHICH DR DAVY DESCRIBES
A FEW WERE MILL-OWNERS AND MANUFACTURERS IN A SMALL WAY
SHE SPOKE OF THE OAT-CAKE AT COWAN BRIDGE THE CLAP-BREAD OF WESTMORLAND AS BEING DIFFERENT TO THE LEAVEN RAISED OAT-CAKE OF YORKSHIRE AND OF HER CHILDISH DISTASTE FOR IT
AND A GREAT CAPABILITY FOR DRINKING WITHOUT THE HEAD BEING AFFECTED WAS CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE MANLY VIRTUES
AS THE ENTRANCE TO THIS FROM THE ROAD IS AT THE SIDE THE PATH GOES ROUND THE CORNER INTO THE LITTLE PLOT OF GROUND
THEY RETAIN A FAITHFUL AND FOND RECOLLECTION OF CHARLOTTE AND SPEAK OF HER UNVARYING KINDNESS FROM THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS EVER SUCH A LITTLE CHILD WHEN SHE WOULD NOT REST TILL SHE HAD GOT THE OLD DISUSED CRADLE SENT FROM THE PARSONAGE TO THE HOUSE WHERE THE PARENTS OF ONE OF THEM LIVED TO SERVE FOR A LITTLE INFANT SISTER
I CANNOT REST TILL I HAVE ANSWERED YOUR LETTER EVEN THOUGH BY ADDRESSING YOU A SECOND TIME I SHOULD APPEAR A LITTLE INTRUSIVE
I SEE NO AFFECTATION IN YOUR LETTERS NO TRIFLING NO FRIVOLOUS CONTEMPT OF PLAIN AND WEAK ADMIRATION OF SHOWY PERSONS AND THINGS IN THESE DAYS OF CHEAP RAILWAY TRIPS WE MAY SMILE AT THE IDEA OF A SHORT VISIT TO LONDON HAVING ANY GREAT EFFECT UPON THE CHARACTER WHATEVER IT MAY HAVE UPON THE INTELLECT
WHEN SHE ENTERED THE SCHOOLROOM SHE SAW FROM TWELVE TO FIFTEEN GIRLS LYING ABOUT
ANNE WAS ALSO ENGAGED AS GOVERNESS IN THE SAME FAMILY AND WAS THUS A MISERABLE WITNESS TO HER BROTHER'S DETERIORATION OF CHARACTER AT THIS PERIOD
I GIVE IT AS A SPECIMEN OF THE REMARKABLE POETICAL TALENT SHOWN IN THE VARIOUS DIMINUTIVE WRITINGS OF THIS TIME
THE HISTORY OF THE YEAR 1829
I QUELLED THEM IN FIVE MINUTES
IF THIS SHOULD NOT PROVE THE PRELUDE TO SOMETHING WORSE I SHALL THINK LITTLE OF IT AS IT IS THE FIRST DISASTROUS CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAS OCCURRED SINCE I LEFT MY HOME THE LAST OF THESE LETTERS IS DATED DECEMBER THE 5TH
JE L'AI DIT ET JE LE REPETE CET HOMME EST L'EGAL DE NAPOLEON PAR LE GENIE
I TRUST I SHALL NEVER MORE FEEL AMBITIOUS TO SEE MY NAME IN PRINT
AND SHE WOULD LEAVE HIM DIRECTLY AS SOON AS MR B
LINES TO THE RIVER ARAGUA BY THE MARQUIS OF DOURO
SHE SEEMED TO HAVE NO INTEREST OR PLEASURE BEYOND THE FEELING OF DUTY AND WHEN SHE COULD GET USED TO SIT ALONE AND MAKE OUT SHE TOLD ME AFTERWARDS THAT ONE EVENING SHE HAD SAT IN THE DRESSING-ROOM UNTIL IT WAS QUITE DARK AND THEN OBSERVING IT ALL AT ONCE HAD TAKEN SUDDEN FRIGHT NO DOUBT SHE REMEMBERED THIS WELL WHEN SHE DESCRIBED A SIMILAR TERROR GETTING HOLD UPON JANE EYRE
A YEAR IS MADE FOR MUSIC OR DRAWING EACH RULE 3RD REQUESTS THAT THE FRIENDS WILL STATE THE LINE OF EDUCATION DESIRED IN THE CASE OF EVERY PUPIL HAVING A REGARD TO HER FUTURE PROSPECTS
I KNOW YOU LIVING IN THE COUNTRY CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE LIFE CAN BE MONOTONOUS IN THE CENTRE OF A BRILLIANT CAPITAL LIKE BRUSSELS
IN ORDER TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR TIME AND BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE LANGUAGE THESE ENGLISH SISTERS WENT DAILY THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS TO THE PENSIONNAT IN THE RUE D'ISABELLE
IN A FRAGMENT OF ONE OF HIS MANUSCRIPTS WHICH I HAVE READ THERE IS A JUSTNESS AND FELICITY OF EXPRESSION WHICH IS VERY STRIKING
NOUS SOMMES AFFLIGES PARCE QUE CETTE BRUSQUE SEPARATION VIENT BRISER L'AFFECTION PRESQUE PATERNELLE QUE NOUS LEUR AVONS VOUEE ET NOTRE PEINE S'AUGMENTE A LA VUE DE TANT DE TRAVAUX INTERROMPUES DE TANT DE CHOSES BIEN COMMENCEES ET QUI NE DEMANDENT QUE QUELQUE TEMPS ENCORE POUR ETRE MENEES A BONNE FIN
CARUS WILSON THE SON OF THE FOUNDER GIVING IT AS SEVENTY
HE WENT IMMEDIATELY AND CHANGED IT AT A PUBLIC-HOUSE AND HAS EMPLOYED IT AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED
NO RURAL DISTRICT HAS BEEN MORE MARKEDLY THE ABODE OF MUSICAL TASTE AND ACQUIREMENT AND THIS AT A PERIOD WHEN IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND THEM TO THE SAME EXTENT APART FROM TOWNS IN ADVANCE OF THEIR TIMES
BEFORE MARIA BRONTE'S DEATH THAT LOW FEVER BROKE OUT IN THE SPRING OF 1825 WHICH IS SPOKEN OF IN JANE EYRE MR WILSON WAS EXTREMELY ALARMED AT THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF THIS
J'ESPERE QU'EN PEU DE MOIS ELLES AURONT CE PLAISIR BUT IT WAS SOME TIME YET BEFORE THE FRIENDS COULD MEET AND MEANWHILE THEY AGREED TO CORRESPOND ONCE A MONTH
AND HER WHOLE NATURE REVOLTED FROM THIS WOMAN'S SOCIETY
OUT OF WHICH SHE HAD TO PAY FOR HER GERMAN LESSONS FOR WHICH SHE WAS CHARGED AS MUCH THE LESSONS BEING PROBABLY RATED BY TIME AS WHEN EMILY LEARNT WITH HER AND DIVIDED THE EXPENSE VIZ TEN FRANCS A MONTH
DURING THE WHOLE TIME THAT THE VOLUME OF POEMS WAS IN THE COURSE OF PREPARATION AND PUBLICATION NO WORD WAS WRITTEN TELLING ANYONE OUT OF THE HOUSEHOLD CIRCLE WHAT WAS IN PROGRESS
AND THEY WERE ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF PICKING UP AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION FOR THEMSELVES
THE OPENING OF THE DOORS
AND AFTER TABBY GREW OLD AND INFIRM IT WAS EMILY WHO MADE ALL THE BREAD FOR THE FAMILY
I WAS ONCE SPEAKING TO HER ABOUT AGNES GREY"--THE NOVEL IN WHICH HER SISTER ANNE PRETTY LITERALLY DESCRIBES HER OWN EXPERIENCE AS A GOVERNESS--AND ALLUDING MORE PARTICULARLY TO THE ACCOUNT OF THE STONING OF THE LITTLE NESTLINGS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PARENT BIRDS
HE SAYS I HAVE KNOWN MISS BRONTE AS MISS BRONTE A LONG TIME
FROM THE GENERAL SUCCESS OF HIS EFFORTS HE GROWS TO DEPEND UPON THEM AND TO OVER-ESTEEM HIS OWN ENERGY AND POWER
IN A TOWN ONE DOES NOT LOOK FOR VIVID COLOURING
SOME OF THE RIOTERS VOWED THAT IF HE DID NOT GIVE IN THEY WOULD LEAVE THIS AND GO TO HIS HOUSE AND MURDER HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN
TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF WATER AS WELL AS TO GIVE THEIR WORKPEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY OF SAVAGE DELIGHT THE MASTERS WERE ACCUSTOMED TO STOP THEIR MILLS ON THE DAY WHEN THE SPORT TOOK PLACE
VINEGAR AND VEGETABLES WITH A VERY LITTLE SALT FISH FOR DINNER
HER WAY OF SITTING ON THE RUG READING WITH HER ARM ROUND HER ROUGH BULL-DOG'S NECK
BUT SHE COULD NOT PATIENTLY BEAR THE SORROWS OF OTHERS ESPECIALLY OF HER SISTERS
BUT I NEVER COULD CONCEIVE WHERE THE CAPITAL WAS TO COME FROM FOR MAKING SUCH A SPECULATION
THE INHABITANTS OF WHICH ARE OF THE SAME RACE AND POSSESS THE SAME QUALITY OF CHARACTER
I WOULD GO TO BRUSSELS IN BELGIUM
CHARACTERS OF GREAT MEN OF THE PRESENT AGE DEC
THEY WOULD HAVE SOME TIME OF THEIR OWN IN WHICH TO TRY AGAIN AND YET AGAIN AT THAT LITERARY CAREER WHICH IN SPITE OF ALL BAFFLING DIFFICULTIES WAS NEVER QUITE SET ASIDE AS AN ULTIMATE OBJECT
I WOULD NOT GO TO FRANCE OR TO PARIS
MR WHITFIELD WAS ONCE PREACHING IN HAWORTH AND MADE USE OF SOME SUCH EXPRESSION AS THAT HE HOPED THERE WAS NO NEED TO SAY MUCH TO THIS CONGREGATION AS THEY HAD SAT UNDER SO PIOUS AND GODLY A MINISTER FOR SO MANY YEARS
AND OF HIS STRONG SENSE AND FORETHOUGHT THERE IS A PROOF IN THE FACT THAT KNOWING THAT HIS FATHER COULD AFFORD HIM NO PECUNIARY AID AND THAT HE MUST DEPEND UPON HIS OWN EXERTIONS HE OPENED A PUBLIC SCHOOL AT THE EARLY AGE OF SIXTEEN
HEGER ON THE MANNER IN WHICH HE FORMED HIS PUPILS STYLE AND TO GIVE A PROOF OF HIS SUCCESS BY COPYING A DEVOIR OF CHARLOTTE'S WITH HIS REMARKS UPON IT
AND MADAME HEGER ARE THE ONLY TWO PERSONS IN THE HOUSE FOR WHOM I REALLY EXPERIENCE REGARD AND ESTEEM AND OF COURSE I CANNOT BE ALWAYS WITH THEM NOR EVEN VERY OFTEN
THE CHURCH WAS NOT WARMED THERE BEING NO MEANS FOR THIS PURPOSE
EVERY ONE WISHES US WELL
THE SPIRIT OF CAWDOR
THE IMPRESSIONS MADE UPON THEM BY THE WORLD WITHOUT--THE UNUSUAL SIGHTS OF EARTH AND SKY--THE ACCIDENTAL MEETINGS WITH STRANGE FACES AND FIGURES RARE OCCURRENCES IN THOSE OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACES)--ARE SOMETIMES MAGNIFIED BY THEM INTO THINGS SO DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT AS TO BE ALMOST SUPERNATURAL
THE REASON FOR THIS WAS MADE EVIDENT ABOUT THE SAME TIME IN THE READING OF THE SERVICE AS THE DISTURBANCES HAD BEGUN THE PREVIOUS WEEK
IT IS A STORMY EVENING AND THE WIND IS UTTERING A CONTINUAL MOANING SOUND THAT MAKES ME FEEL VERY MELANCHOLY
IN THE DAYS OF THE LUDDITES HE HAD BEEN FOR THE PEREMPTORY INTERFERENCE OF THE LAW AT A TIME WHEN NO MAGISTRATE COULD BE FOUND TO ACT AND ALL THE PROPERTY OF THE WEST RIDING WAS IN TERRIBLE DANGER
ONE DAY RESEMBLES ANOTHER
HEGER'S ADVICE BECAUSE SHE WAS BOUND TO OBEY HIM WHILE SHE WAS HIS PUPIL
SUCH BEING THE CASE I THINK YOU AND I HAD BETTER ADHERE TO OUR FIRST PLAN OF GOING SOMEWHERE TOGETHER INDEPENDENTLY OF OTHER PEOPLE
THEY LACKED THE POWER OF EXECUTION NOT OF CONCEPTION
MR AYLOTT HAS KINDLY PLACED THE LETTERS WHICH SHE WROTE TO THEM ON THE SUBJECT AT MY DISPOSAL
BUT WHILE MR REDHEAD WAS READING THE SECOND LESSON THE WHOLE CONGREGATION AS BY ONE IMPULSE BEGAN TO LEAVE THE CHURCH MAKING ALL THE NOISE THEY COULD WITH CLATTERING AND CLUMPING OF CLOGS TILL AT LENGTH MR REDHEAD AND THE CLERK WERE THE ONLY TWO LEFT TO CONTINUE THE SERVICE
FOR SHE EVIDENTLY IMAGINES THAT AN ENTIRE CHANGE OF CHARACTER FOR THE WORSE IS THE USUAL EFFECT OF A VISIT TO THE GREAT METROPOLIS AND IS DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT E IS E STILL
EMILY QUICKLY DECIDED TO BE THE DAUGHTER TO REMAIN AT HOME
AND IN THE EVENING I WILL NOT AND OUGHT NOT TO INTRUDE ON M
EXCUSE ME DEAR FOR TROUBLING YOU WITH MY FRUITLESS WISHES
AND IN PROPORTION AS ALL THE ORDINARY USES OF THE WORLD SEEM TO YOU FLAT AND UNPROFITABLE YOU WILL BE UNFITTED FOR THEM WITHOUT BECOMING FITTED FOR ANYTHING ELSE
I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT
HER HEAD WAS SEVERELY CUT BUT SHE BORE ALL THE CONSEQUENT SUFFERING WITH EXEMPLARY PATIENCE AND BY IT WON MUCH UPON MY ESTEEM
LET ME NOW REQUEST THAT IF YOU EVER SHOULD COME TO THESE LAKES WHILE I AM LIVING HERE YOU WILL LET ME SEE YOU
BUT AT THIS DAY EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT THE SITE OF A BUILDING INTENDED FOR NUMBERS SHOULD BE CHOSEN WITH FAR GREATER CARE THAN THAT OF A PRIVATE DWELLING FROM THE TENDENCY TO ILLNESS BOTH INFECTIOUS AND OTHERWISE PRODUCED BY THE CONGREGATION OF PEOPLE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY
BUT IT WAS OFTEN UNEATABLE BECAUSE THE WATER HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE RAIN TUB AND WAS STRONGLY IMPREGNATED WITH THE DUST LODGING ON THE ROOF WHENCE IT HAD TRICKLED DOWN INTO THE OLD WOODEN CASK WHICH ALSO ADDED ITS OWN FLAVOUR TO THAT OF THE ORIGINAL RAIN WATER
SUDDENLY WE HEARD A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MR DAY BROKE OFF HIS INTENTION OF MARRYING SABRINA THE GIRL WHOM HE HAD EDUCATED FOR THIS PURPOSE BECAUSE WITHIN A FEW WEEKS OF THE TIME FIXED FOR THE WEDDING SHE WAS GUILTY OF THE FRIVOLITY WHILE ON A VISIT FROM HOME OF WEARING THIN SLEEVES
EVIDENTLY FROM AN INSTINCTIVE DESIRE TO EXPRESS THEIR POWERFUL IMAGINATIONS IN VISIBLE FORMS
AND GIVING AND RECEIVING CHALLENGES FROM OTHER PARISHES
SINCE THE D.S LEFT I HAVE HAD NO FRIEND
AND TREASURE UP THE TRADITIONS CONNECTED WITH THE STATELY HOUSEHOLDS THAT EXISTED CENTURIES AGO
THE DUTIES OF THE SCHOOL WERE THEN SUSPENDED FOR SIX WEEKS OR TWO MONTHS AND IT SEEMED A DESIRABLE PERIOD FOR THEIR RETURN
THE FOURTH TO A PACKER OR MERCER AND SO ON WERE THERE MORE TO BE PROVIDED FOR
DID CHARLOTTE WANT A KNIGHT-ERRANT OR A DEVOTED LOVER THE MARQUIS OF DOURO OR LORD CHARLES WELLESLEY CAME READY TO HER HAND
THEY LEFT IN THE LATTER PART OF AUGUST AND I AM COMPLETELY ALONE
SO AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER THE LOVERS BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT TAKING A HOUSE FOR I SUPPOSE THAT MR BRONTE UP TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN IN LODGINGS
THE REVIEWER ASSIGNS TO ELLIS THE HIGHEST RANK OF THE THREE BROTHERS AS HE SUPPOSES THEM TO BE
I TOLD HER SOMETIMES THEY WERE LIKE GROWING POTATOES IN A CELLAR
AND THIS NECESSITY COMBINED WITH DUE ATTENTION TO HIS PAROCHIAL DUTIES MADE HIM PARTIALLY IGNORANT HOW HIS SON EMPLOYED HIMSELF OUT OF LESSON-TIME
BUT NOT MERELY WERE HER ACTIONS KIND HER WORDS AND TONES WERE EVER GENTLE AND CARESSING TOWARDS ANIMALS
MARY IS IN NEW ZEALAND
THEY THREW BOTH HIM AND HIS TORMENTOR DOWN ON THE GROUND IN THE CHURCHYARD WHERE THE SOOT-BAG HAD BEEN EMPTIED AND THOUGH AT LAST MR REDHEAD ESCAPED INTO THE BLACK BULL THE DOORS OF WHICH WERE IMMEDIATELY BARRED THE PEOPLE RAGED WITHOUT THREATENING TO STONE HIM AND HIS FRIENDS
THEY WERE SO MUCH DIFFERENT TO ANYBODY ELSE
CHARLOTTE WAS SOMETIMES EXCITED SUFFICIENTLY TO SPEAK ELOQUENTLY AND WELL--ON CERTAIN SUBJECTS
3 CHAPTER V FOR THE REASON JUST STATED THE LITTLE GIRLS WERE SENT HOME IN THE AUTUMN OF 1825 WHEN CHARLOTTE WAS LITTLE MORE THAN NINE YEARS OLD
OF THE MYSTERIOUS NIGHTLY DRILLINGS
AUTUMN A SONG
SOMETIMES SHE OWNED TO A LITTLE TRUTH IN IT BUT GENERALLY SAID NOTHING
I THINK SIR THAT THE HORRIBLE WICKEDNESS OF THIS NEEDS NO REMARK AND THEREFORE I HASTE TO SUBSCRIBE MYSELF C
MARIA WOULD SHUT HERSELF UP MARIA BUT SEVEN IN THE CHILDREN'S STUDY WITH A NEWSPAPER AND BE ABLE TO TELL ONE EVERYTHING WHEN SHE CAME OUT
THEY FORGET THEM WHEN THEIR STOMACH OR WHATEVER ORGAN IT IS THAT INFLICTS SUCH MISERY ON SEDENTARY PEOPLE WILL LET THEM

MINUTE AS THE DETAILS CONVEYED IN THESE NOTES ARE THEY ARE NOT TRIVIAL BECAUSE THEY AFFORD SUCH STRONG INDICATIONS OF CHARACTER
HIMSELF HAD BEEN MUCH ABROAD BOTH ON BUSINESS AND TO SEE THE GREAT CONTINENTAL GALLERIES OF PAINTINGS
EVERYBODY IS ABUNDANTLY CIVIL BUT HOME-SICKNESS KEEPS CREEPING OVER ME
THIS TIME SHE ESTEEMED HERSELF FORTUNATE IN BECOMING A MEMBER OF A KIND-HEARTED AND FRIENDLY HOUSEHOLD
THE DISTANCE IS ABOUT FOUR MILES
I SUPPOSE FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD THAT MR TIGHE BECAME STRONGLY INTERESTED IN HIS CHILDREN'S TUTOR AND MAY HAVE AIDED HIM NOT ONLY IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS STUDIES BUT IN THE SUGGESTION OF AN ENGLISH UNIVERSITY EDUCATION AND IN ADVICE AS TO THE MODE IN WHICH HE SHOULD OBTAIN ENTRANCE THERE
ONCE A YEAR A GRAND MATCH WAS HELD UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF SOME SAINT TO WHOSE CHURCH-STEEPLE WAS AFFIXED THE BIRD OR SEMBLANCE OF A BIRD TO BE HIT BY THE VICTOR
I HOPE YOU ARE WELL
OUR FELLOWS JULY 1827
I FEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN HERE DURING THIS SEVERE WEATHER YOUR VISIT WOULD HAVE BEEN OF NO ADVANTAGE TO YOU FOR THE MOORS ARE BLOCKADED WITH SNOW AND YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT
IF BY THIS MEANS THEY THREE COULD LIVE TOGETHER AND MAINTAIN THEMSELVES ALL MIGHT GO WELL
SHE MADE HERSELF READY AND DROVE WITH HIM IN HIS GIG
THE QUESTION HOWEVER WAS AS YET UNDECIDED IN WHAT DIRECTION SHE SHOULD EMPLOY HER FORCES
BUT THEY KNEW THAT THEY MIGHT DECEIVE THEMSELVES AND THAT SISTERS JUDGMENTS OF EACH OTHER'S PRODUCTIONS WERE LIKELY TO BE TOO PARTIAL TO BE DEPENDED UPON
WHETHER IN ITS WRATH DISDAIN OR ITS DISMAY THE COUNTENANCE WAS INFERNAL
SHE GAVE A PROOF OF THIS IN HER FIRST TREATMENT OF CHARLOTTE
THE PLAIN FACT IS I WAS NOT I AM NOT NOW CERTAIN OF MY DESTINY
NOTHING OF THAT KIND COULD BE HAD NEARER THAN KEIGHLEY BEFORE I BEGAN
SEVERAL OF THE MORE INFLUENTIAL INHABITANTS OF HAWORTH AND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WERE MILL-OWNERS
MAKING IN THE WHOLE TWENTY-TWO VOLUMES
THE LAND HAS OFTEN BEEN HELD BY ONE FAMILY SINCE THE DAYS OF THE TUDORS
YOUR LETTERS AND THE FRENCH NEWSPAPERS ARE THE ONLY MESSENGERS THAT COME TO ME FROM THE OUTER WORLD BEYOND OUR MOORS
FROM THE SPLENDOUR OF TO-DAY IN THE RUE ROYALE IF YOU TURN ASIDE NEAR THE STATUE OF THE GENERAL BELIARD YOU LOOK DOWN FOUR FLIGHTS OF BROAD STONE STEPS UPON THE RUE D'ISABELLE
AND AT LAST STOLE THE GREAT BELL OF BIRSTALL CHURCH FOR WHICH SACRILEGIOUS THEFT A FINE WAS IMPOSED ON THE LAND AND HAS TO BE PAID BY THE OWNER OF THE HALL TO THIS DAY
SOON AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL SHE ADMITTED READING SOMETHING OF COBBETT'S
LORD C
1ST 1829
BUT MISS W WAS A LADY OF REMARKABLE INTELLIGENCE AND OF DELICATE TENDER SYMPATHY
I WAS SURPRISED ALSO AT THE DEGREE OF REGRET EXPRESSED BY MY BELGIAN PUPILS WHEN THEY KNEW I WAS GOING TO LEAVE
YOUR LOVING CHILD AS YOU CHOOSE TO CALL ME SO C
SHE MANAGED IN A MOST HANDSOME AND ABLE MANNER FOR ME WHEN I WAS IN BRUSSELS AND PREVENTED BY DISTANCE FROM LOOKING AFTER MY OWN INTERESTS
HER POWERFUL REASON WOULD HAVE DEDUCED NEW SPHERES OF DISCOVERY FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE OLD
WHOEVER THEREFORE IS AMBITIOUS OF DISTINCTION IN THIS WAY OUGHT TO BE PREPARED FOR DISAPPOINTMENT
THE MISFORTUNES SHE MENTIONED WERE NOT ALWAYS TO HERSELF
ALL SINCE DEAD EXCEPT MR BRONTE
BUT THERE ARE NO PUPILS TO BE HAD
I SHALL REACH B
HUMAN FEELINGS ARE QUEER THINGS
IN THIS HE WAS SUPPORTED BY MANY MEMBERS OF THE CHAPEL AND CONGREGATION
IL SE FAIT AIMER DE TOUS CEUX QUI L'APPROCHENT ET SURTOUT DES ENFANTS
ACCORDINGLY SHE BOUGHT A SMALL VOLUME FROM WHICH TO LEARN ALL SHE COULD ON THE SUBJECT OF PREPARATION FOR THE PRESS
SHE HAD A SISTER LIVING IN THE VILLAGE
HE EXPENDED QUITE AS MUCH IN MY EDUCATION AS HE COULD AFFORD IN JUSTICE TO THE REST
I IMAGINE THE CAUSE OF THIS DIFFERENCE TO BE TWOFOLD
YOU CAN HARDLY FANCY IT POSSIBLE I DARE SAY THAT I CANNOT FIND A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO SCRIBBLE A NOTE IN
AND ON THEIR RETURN INTO THE COUNTRY WHEN SETTLED IN BUSINESS THEY WERE NOT EXCLUDED FROM WHAT WOULD NOW BE CONSIDERED GENTEEL SOCIETY

THE SCHOOL-HOURS WERE FROM NINE TO TWELVE THE LUNCHEON HOUR WHEN THE BOARDERS AND HALF-BOARDERS--PERHAPS TWO-AND-THIRTY GIRLS--WENT TO THE REFECTOIRE A ROOM WITH TWO LONG TABLES HAVING AN OIL LAMP SUSPENDED OVER EACH TO PARTAKE OF BREAD AND FRUIT
THE GREAT PUZZLE LAY IN THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING ANSWERS OF ANY KIND FROM THE PUBLISHERS TO WHOM WE APPLIED
IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN BUILT ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND TO CONSIST OF FOUR ROOMS ON EACH STORY
BUT THE NUMBER OF PUPILS HAD DIMINISHED
MARY HAD PREVIOUSLY INFORMED ME OF YOUR DEPARTURE FOR LONDON AND I HAD NOT VENTURED TO CALCULATE ON ANY COMMUNICATION FROM YOU WHILE SURROUNDED BY THE SPLENDOURS AND NOVELTIES OF THAT GREAT CITY WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED THE MERCANTILE METROPOLIS OF EUROPE
HER SISTER TENDED HER WITH DEVOTED LOVE
SHE EXPRESSED GREAT DISGUST AND CONTEMPT TOWARDS HIM AND DID NOT AFFECT TO HAVE THE SHADOW OF REGARD IN ANY WAY
WHEN THE FIRST MEMORIALS WERE WRITTEN DOWN THE SURVIVORS IN THEIR FOND AFFECTION THOUGHT LITTLE OF THE MARGIN AND VERGE THEY WERE LEAVING FOR THOSE WHO WERE STILL LIVING
MLLE CHARLOTTE COMMENCAIT A DONNER DES LECONS EN FRANCAIS ET D'ACQUERIR CETTE ASSURANCE CET APLOMB SI NECESSAIRE DANS L'ENSEIGNEMENT
IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THE RUE D'ISABELLE WAS CALLED THE FOSSE-AUX CHIENS
THE SUBSTANCE HOWEVER WAS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE STATED THE STRANGE AND QUAINT SIMPLICITY OF THE MODE TAKEN BY THE FATHER TO ASCERTAIN THE HIDDEN CHARACTERS OF HIS CHILDREN AND THE TONE AND CHARACTER OF THESE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS SHOW THE CURIOUS EDUCATION WHICH WAS MADE BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE BRONTES
BUT MR BRONTE IS NO TIMID MAN AND PERHAPS HE FELT THAT HE COULD POSSIBLY INFLUENCE HIS SON TO SOME SELF-RESTRAINT MORE BY SHOWING TRUST IN HIM THAN BY SHOWING FEAR
BUT THE CHILDREN DID NOT WANT SOCIETY
THEY HAD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BECOME SILENTLY AWARE THAT HIS HABITS WERE SUCH AS TO RENDER HIS SOCIETY AT TIMES MOST UNDESIRABLE
I DO INDEED
HE SAW THAT IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK FOR CLERGYMEN WITH LIMITED INCOMES TO PROVIDE FOR THE EDUCATION OF THEIR CHILDREN
THE FOUNDER ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF EDGAR WAS BOUND WITHOUT SUBTRACTING FROM HIS TITHES TO MAINTAIN THE MINISTERING PRIEST OUT OF THE REMAINING NINE PARTS OF HIS INCOME
IT SO HAPPENS THAT I CAN GET NO CONVEYANCE THIS WEEK OR THE NEXT

YOU TANTALIZE ME TO DEATH WITH TALKING OF CONVERSATIONS BY THE FIRESIDE
I INTEND TO WALK TO KEIGHLEY THERE TO TAKE THE COACH AS FAR AS B THEN TO GET SOME ONE TO CARRY MY BOX AND TO WALK THE REST OF THE WAY TO G IF I MANAGE THIS I THINK I SHALL CONTRIVE VERY WELL
AND I HAVE BEEN HAPPY IN BRUSSELS BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FULLY OCCUPIED WITH THE EMPLOYMENTS THAT I LIKE
A PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF ALL KINDS OF HOUSEHOLD WORK
I WHO HAVE MADE LITERATURE MY PROFESSION AND DEVOTED MY LIFE TO IT AND HAVE NEVER FOR A MOMENT REPENTED OF THE DELIBERATE CHOICE THINK MYSELF NEVERTHELESS BOUND IN DUTY TO CAUTION EVERY YOUNG MAN WHO APPLIES AS AN ASPIRANT TO ME FOR ENCOURAGEMENT AND ADVICE AGAINST TAKING SO PERILOUS A COURSE
THE OLD CUSTOM OF ARVILLS OR FUNERAL FEASTS LED TO FREQUENT PITCHED BATTLES BETWEEN THE DRUNKEN MOURNERS
GIRLS ARE PROTECTED AS IF THEY WERE SOMETHING VERY FRAIL OR SILLY INDEED WHILE BOYS ARE TURNED LOOSE ON THE WORLD AS IF THEY OF ALL BEINGS IN EXISTENCE WERE THE WISEST AND LEAST LIABLE TO BE LED ASTRAY
I KNOW THAT I AM TO STAY HERE DURING THE FIVE WEEKS THAT THE HOLIDAYS LAST AND THAT I SHALL BE MUCH ALONE DURING THAT TIME AND CONSEQUENTLY GET DOWNCAST AND FIND BOTH DAYS AND NIGHTS OF A WEARY LENGTH
IT WILL DO BOTH OF US GOOD
ENTRANCE FOR BOOKS
BUT IF I COULD HEAR OF A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENCING A SCHOOL I THINK I SHOULD EMBRACE IT
EITHER THE POSSESSOR FALLS INTO IDLE DRINKING HABITS AND SO IS OBLIGED EVENTUALLY TO SELL HIS PROPERTY
AND BESIDES HE WAS NOT NATURALLY FOND OF CHILDREN AND FELT THEIR FREQUENT APPEARANCE ON THE SCENE AS A DRAG BOTH ON HIS WIFE'S STRENGTH AND AS AN INTERRUPTION TO THE COMFORT OF THE HOUSEHOLD
DID HE FEEL WHAT A MAN MIGHT FEEL FRIEND-LEFT AND SORE DISTREST
WE HAD VERY EARLY CHERISHED THE DREAM OF ONE DAY BEING AUTHORS
I AM MORALLY CERTAIN NO DECENT WOMAN COULD EXPERIENCE ANYTHING BUT AVERSION TOWARDS SUCH A MAN AS MR BEFORE I KNEW OR SUSPECTED HIS CHARACTER AND WHEN I RATHER WONDERED AT HIS VERSATILE TALENTS I FELT IT IN AN UNCONTROLLABLE DEGREE
HER HANDS AND FEET WERE THE SMALLEST I EVER SAW
THEY WERE ALL IN ALL TO EACH OTHER
BELL WOULD BE OBLIGED TO YOU TO POST THE ENCLOSED NOTE IN LONDON
THIS IS FAR FROM BEING THE CASE
TAKE OAKWELL HALL FOR INSTANCE
BELL
YET ALTHOUGH THERE WAS ECONOMY IN PROVIDING FOR THE HOUSEHOLD THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ANY PARSIMONY
I CANNOT MEASURE THEM MUCH LESS IS IT FOR ME TO JUDGE THEM
I OWN I HAD MISGIVINGS THAT NOBODY WOULD BE WILLING TO SEND A CHILD FOR EDUCATION TO HAWORTH
NOTHING BUT TEACH TEACH TEACH FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT
C'EST LA QU'IL DOIT ETRE ET NON PAS AILLEURS
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS OF BRANWELL'S LIFE HE TOOK OPIUM HABITUALLY BY WAY OF STUNNING CONSCIENCE
BUT I HAD NOT MUCH ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FAMILY TILL ABOUT 1843 WHEN I BEGAN TO DO A LITTLE IN THE STATIONERY LINE
ALL FROM HIS DEATH-BED GONE
A SINGULAR ACCOUNT WAS RECENTLY GIVEN ME OF A LANDOWNER LIVING IT IS TRUE ON THE LANCASHIRE SIDE OF THE HILLS BUT OF THE SAME BLOOD AND NATURE AS THE DWELLERS ON THE OTHER WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE RECEIPT OF SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED A YEAR AND WHOSE HOUSE BORE MARKS OF HANDSOME ANTIQUITY AS IF HIS FOREFATHERS HAD BEEN FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE OF CONSIDERATION
RECKON ON ME NO MORE
BUT I DO SERIOUSLY APPREHEND THAT MRS
AND ACCORDINGLY AS I STATED THE INHABITANTS HAVE FOR CENTURIES BEEN ENGAGED IN MAKING CLOTH AS WELL AS IN AGRICULTURAL PURSUITS
HE DETERMINED TO ENFORCE THIS BY FREQUENT PERSONAL INSPECTION
JE CRAINS QUE MARIA-LOUISE ET CLAIRE NE M'AIENT DEJA OUBLIEES
SIR,--I MOST EARNESTLY ENTREAT YOU TO READ AND PASS YOUR JUDGMENT UPON WHAT I HAVE SENT YOU BECAUSE FROM THE DAY OF MY BIRTH TO THIS THE NINETEENTH YEAR OF MY LIFE I HAVE LIVED AMONG SECLUDED HILLS WHERE I COULD NEITHER KNOW WHAT I WAS OR WHAT I COULD DO
BUT AT THE END OF THE TIME EMILY WAS AS IMPENETRABLE TO FRIENDLY ADVANCES AS AT THE BEGINNING
AND ONE CAN SEE THAT THE PARSONAGE WAS BUILT IN THE DAYS WHEN WOOD WAS PLENTIFUL AS THE MASSIVE STAIR-BANISTERS AND THE WAINSCOTS AND THE HEAVY WINDOW-FRAMES TESTIFY
IV
THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO THINK TO ANALYSE TO REJECT TO APPRECIATE
CETTE FIERTE NEANMOINS N'EXCLUAIT PAS EN LUI UNE RARE MODESTIE
FROM THEIR FIRST GOING TO HAWORTH THEIR WALKS WERE DIRECTED RATHER OUT TOWARDS THE HEATHERY MOORS SLOPING UPWARDS BEHIND THE PARSONAGE THAN TOWARDS THE LONG DESCENDING VILLAGE STREET
IT SHOWED A DEGREE OF INTEREST IN MY CONCERNS WHICH I HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXPECT FROM ANY EARTHLY CREATURE
HE WOULD READ BOSSUET'S DESCRIPTION OF HIM IN THE ORAISON FUNEBRE DE LA REINE D'ANGLETERRE AND SHOW HOW IN THIS HE WAS CONSIDERED ENTIRELY FROM THE RELIGIOUS POINT OF VIEW AS AN INSTRUMENT IN THE HANDS OF GOD PREORDAINED TO HIS WORK
IN NO OTHER PART OF ENGLAND I FANCY ARE THE CENTURIES BROUGHT INTO SUCH CLOSE STRANGE CONTACT AS IN THE DISTRICT IN WHICH ROE HEAD IS SITUATED
THE SILENT SULLEN MULTITUDE MARCHED IN THE DEAD OF THAT SPRING-NIGHT TO RAWFOLDS AND GIVING TONGUE WITH A GREAT SHOUT ROUSED MR CARTWRIGHT UP TO THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE LONG-EXPECTED ATTACK WAS COME
SEXCENTISSIMO THAT IS TO SAY BEFORE THE PREACHING OF CHRISTIANITY IN NORTHUMBRIA
AND BESIDES IT WAS MORE PORTABLE
AND WOULD NOT EVEN ALLOW HIS PARISHIONERS TO WALK IN THE FIELDS BETWEEN SERVICES
SO SHE WENT OUT AND WITH WEARY STEPS WOULD TRAVERSE THE BOULEVARDS AND THE STREETS SOMETIMES FOR HOURS TOGETHER
BUT THIS DIGNIFIED ENDURANCE OF HERS SUBDUED HER PUPILS IN THE LONG RUN FAR MORE THAN THE VOLUBLE TIRADES OF THE OTHER MISTRESSES
THE CROSS-BOW MEN'S ARCHERY-GROUND--ALL ARE THERE--THE PENSIONNAT OF MADAME HEGER
HE HAS NOW THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN EITHER READING OR WRITING
AND ONE CARES THE LESS TO READ IT AS SHE HERSELF CONDEMNED IT IN THE PREFACE TO THE PROFESSOR BY SAYING THAT IN THIS STORY SHE HAD GOT OVER SUCH TASTE AS SHE MIGHT ONCE HAVE HAD FOR THE ORNAMENTAL AND REDUNDANT IN COMPOSITION THE BEGINNING TOO AS SHE ACKNOWLEDGES WAS ON A SCALE COMMENSURATE WITH ONE OF RICHARDSON'S NOVELS OF SEVEN OR EIGHT VOLUMES
WHAT THEIR PLANS WERE LET CHARLOTTE EXPLAIN
A FEW DAYS AFTER I GOT A LETTER THE DIRECTION OF WHICH PUZZLED ME IT BEING IN A HAND I WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE
AS HE STROLLED ON THROUGH HIS FIELDS WITH HIS MAGNIFICENT NEWFOUNDLAND DOG AT HIS SIDE HE LOOKED VERY LIKE WHAT A FRANK WEALTHY CONSERVATIVE GENTLEMAN OUGHT TO BE
ANOTHER DIM SORROW WAS FAINTLY PERCEIVED AT THIS TIME
HEGER'S REMARKS
WHEN IN HEALTH SHE USED TO TALK BETTER AND INDEED WHEN IN LOW SPIRITS NEVER SPOKE AT ALL
AT FIRST I RECEIVED THE PROPOSAL CORDIALLY AND PREPARED TO DO MY UTMOST TO BRING ABOUT SUCCESS
THE 1ST OF APRIL IS HIS BIRTH-DAY
OF WEARYING THE OBJECTS OF HER AFFECTION
I WILL AVAIL MYSELF OF IT TO REQUEST INFORMATION ON TWO OR THREE POINTS
YOUR OPINION AND ADVICE ON THESE THREE POINTS OR ON ANY OTHER WHICH YOUR EXPERIENCE MAY SUGGEST AS IMPORTANT WOULD BE ESTEEMED BY US AS A FAVOUR IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE WHOLE TENOR OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE THAT THE TRUTHFULNESS AND PROBITY OF THE FIRM OF PUBLISHERS WITH WHOM SHE HAD TO DEAL IN THIS HER FIRST LITERARY VENTURE WERE STRONGLY IMPRESSED UPON HER MIND AND WAS FOLLOWED BY THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF RELIANCE ON THEIR SUGGESTIONS
NAPOLEON FLATTAIT LE PEUPLE
ALL HEAVY EYED FLUSHED INDIFFERENT AND WEARY WITH PAINS IN EVERY LIMB
THAT'S ENOUGH NOT MANY WEEKS AFTER THIS WAS WRITTEN CHARLOTTE ALSO BECAME ENGAGED AS A GOVERNESS
SHE WAS FAR SUPERIOR IN MIND TO ANY OF HER PLAY-FELLOWS AND COMPANIONS AND WAS LONELY AMONGST THEM FROM THAT VERY CAUSE
I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED HER ANSWER BUT I WAIT FOR IT WITH SOME ANXIETY
IF YOU WILL NOT HEAR THEM IT WILL BE VAIN THOUGH ONE SHOULD RISE FROM THE DEAD TO INSTRUCT YOU
I WILL THEN SEND THE NECESSARY REMITTANCE TOGETHER WITH THE MANUSCRIPT
WE AGREED TO ARRANGE A SMALL SELECTION OF OUR POEMS AND IF POSSIBLE GET THEM PRINTED
BUT IT WAS AND IS THIS,--THAT THE HOUSE AT CASTERTON SEEMED THOROUGHLY HEALTHY AND WELL KEPT AND IS SITUATED IN A LOVELY SPOT
THEY WERE METHODISTS AND AS FAR AS I CAN GATHER A GENTLE AND SINCERE PIETY GAVE REFINEMENT AND PURITY OF CHARACTER
ALSO OF ANNE THEIR DAUGHTER WHO DIED MAY 28TH 1849 AGED 29 YEARS
AFTER DESCRIBING IN A QUIET AND SIMPLE MANNER THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH MOSES TOOK LEAVE OF THE ISRAELITES HER IMAGINATION BECOMES WARMED AND SHE LAUNCHES OUT INTO A NOBLE STRAIN DEPICTING THE GLORIOUS FUTURITY OF THE CHOSEN PEOPLE AS LOOKING DOWN UPON THE PROMISED LAND HE SEES THEIR PROSPERITY IN PROPHETIC VISION
AND SHE HAD THE FREQUENT HAPPINESS OF SEEING MARY AND MARTHA
SHE WAS NOT HER NIECES CONFIDANTE--PERHAPS NO ONE SO MUCH OLDER COULD HAVE BEEN
I HAVE BEEN ONLY OUT TWICE TO TEA SINCE I CAME HOME
THE FACT IS SOME WEEKS AGO IN A HIGH-FLOWN HUMOUR HE FORBADE ME TO USE EITHER DICTIONARY OR GRAMMAR IN TRANSLATING THE MOST DIFFICULT ENGLISH COMPOSITIONS INTO FRENCH
THE WOOLLEN MANUFACTURE WAS INTRODUCED INTO THIS DISTRICT IN THE DAYS OF EDWARD III
MAIS SON ARDEUR ETAIT CELLE DE L'AME SA FLAMME ETAIT PURE ET ELLE S'ELEVAIT VERS LE CIEL
I NEVER HEARD BEFORE YOUR BOOK THAT THE SWEEP ASCENDED THE PULPIT STEPS
CHARLOTTE SOMETIMES WOULD SIT AND INQUIRE ABOUT OUR CIRCUMSTANCES SO KINDLY AND FEELINGLY
BUT N'IMPORTE
THE TWO YOUNGER SEEMED HARDLY TO HAVE ATTAINED THEIR FULL GROWTH THOUGH EMILY WAS TALLER THAN CHARLOTTE
UNDERNEATH THE WINDOWS IS A NARROW FLOWER-BORDER CAREFULLY TENDED IN DAYS OF YORE ALTHOUGH ONLY THE MOST HARDY PLANTS COULD BE MADE TO GROW THERE
YOU SAY SHE IS CLEVER'--'A CLEVER PERSON HOW I DISLIKE THE TERM
DEPEND UPON IT IF YOU WERE TO PERSUADE A MAMMA TO BRING HER CHILD TO HAWORTH THE ASPECT OF THE PLACE WOULD FRIGHTEN HER AND SHE WOULD PROBABLY TAKE THE DEAR GIRL BACK WITH HER INSTANTER
DANS LA MAISON PATERNELLE IL AVAIT DES FRERES ET DES SOEURS
ONE WONDERS HOW THE BLEAK ASPECT OF HER NEW HOME--THE LOW OBLONG STONE PARSONAGE HIGH UP YET WITH A STILL HIGHER BACK-GROUND OF SWEEPING MOORS--STRUCK ON THE GENTLE DELICATE WIFE WHOSE HEALTH EVEN THEN WAS FAILING
A DULL SENSE OF RELIEF THAT THEIR CHERISHED PROJECT HAD BEEN TRIED AND HAD FAILED
THERE WAS SCARCELY A PARISH IN THE MOUNT'S BAY THAT WAS WITHOUT A HAUNTED HOUSE OR A SPOT TO WHICH SOME STORY OF SUPERNATURAL HORROR WAS NOT ATTACHED
IL L'ENVELOPPE D'INSPIRATION
AND YET WHAT TO DO
I FOUND PAPA VERY WELL
PAIN TREMBLED IN HIS WEARY LIMBS PAIN FILLED HIS PATIENT EYE PAIN-CRUSHED AMID THE SHADOWY FERN HIS BRANCHY CROWN DID LIE
I KNEW IT WOULD AVAIL NOTHING TO WRITE TO YOU THEN TO SAY I WAS IN DOUBT AND UNCERTAINTY--HOPING THIS FEARING THAT ANXIOUS EAGERLY DESIROUS TO DO WHAT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO BE DONE
MEANTIME LIFE WEARS AWAY
IF WE SHOULD BE SEPARATED--IF IT SHOULD BE OUR LOT TO LIVE AT A GREAT DISTANCE AND NEVER TO SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN--IN OLD AGE HOW I SHOULD CONJURE UP THE MEMORY OF MY YOUTHFUL DAYS AND WHAT A MELANCHOLY PLEASURE I SHOULD FEEL IN DWELLING ON THE RECOLLECTION OF MY EARLY FRIEND
BELIEVE ME VERY MERRILY VIVACIOUSLY GAILY YOURS C.B THE GRANDES VACANCES BEGAN SOON AFTER THE DATE OF THIS LETTER WHEN SHE WAS LEFT IN THE GREAT DESERTED PENSIONNAT WITH ONLY ONE TEACHER FOR A COMPANION
IT IS AN INSCRUTABLE FATALITY
THE IDEA OF BEING TOGETHER CONSOLES US BOTH SOMEWHAT AND TRUTH SINCE I MUST ENTER A SITUATION MY LINES HAVE FALLEN IN PLEASANT PLACES I BOTH LOVE AND RESPECT MISS W CHAPTER VIII ON THE 29TH OF JULY 1835 CHARLOTTE NOW A LITTLE MORE THAN NINETEEN YEARS OLD WENT AS TEACHER TO MISS W---'S
AS TO THE DONKEY TALE I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT
NAPOLEON NAQUIT EN CORSE ET MOURUT A STE
SHE ANSWERED AGE AND EXPERIENCE I ASKED THE NEXT EMILY AFTERWARDS ELLIS BELL WHAT I HAD BEST DO WITH HER BROTHER BRANWELL WHO WAS SOMETIMES A NAUGHTY BOY
AND THUS SHE WAS OFTEN TRYING TO RESTRAIN HER WARM FEELINGS AND WAS EVER CHARY OF THAT PRESENCE SO INVARIABLY WELCOME TO HER TRUE FRIENDS
BUT ALL WAS FISH THAT CAME TO HER NET AT THIS TIME SHE WROTE TO ME THAT READING AND DRAWING WERE THE ONLY AMUSEMENTS SHE HAD AND THAT HER SUPPLY OF BOOKS WAS VERY SMALL IN PROPORTION TO HER WANTS
ANNE WAS THE FIRST TO MEET WITH A SITUATION
LET US READ OF THE MISERY CAUSED TO HIS POOR SISTERS IN CHARLOTTE'S OWN AFFECTING WORDS WE HAVE HAD SAD WORK WITH BRANWELL
AND ON HIS CONFESSING THE TRUTH MR ROBERSON GAVE THE WORD OFF WITH HIM LADS TO THE PUMP THE POOR LOVER WAS DRAGGED TO THE COURT-YARD AND THE PUMP SET TO PLAY UPON HIM
WHA YA MAY GO T BED BRANWELL
THERE ARE ALWAYS PECULIAR TRIALS IN THE LIFE OF AN ONLY BOY IN A FAMILY OF GIRLS
LEEDS AND MANCHESTER--WHERE ARE THEY
VERY LONG LETTERS
I AM EXTREMELY GLAD THAT AUNT HAS CONSENTED TO TAKE IN FRASER'S MAGAZINE FOR THOUGH I KNOW FROM YOUR DESCRIPTION OF ITS GENERAL CONTENTS IT WILL BE RATHER UNINTERESTING WHEN COMPARED WITH BLACKWOOD STILL IT WILL BE BETTER THAN REMAINING THE WHOLE YEAR WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO OBTAIN A SIGHT OF ANY PERIODICAL WHATEVER
THEY OFFERED TO BE PRESENT WITH A VIEW TO MAINTAIN ORDER AMONG THE UNRULY BELGIAN GIRLS
THUS I AM A GOOD DEAL BY MYSELF OUT OF SCHOOL-HOURS
GOOD SITUATIONS HAVE BEEN OFFERED HIM FOR WHICH BY A FORTNIGHT'S WORK HE MIGHT HAVE QUALIFIED HIMSELF BUT HE WILL DO NOTHING EXCEPT DRINK AND MAKE US ALL WRETCHED IN THE ATHENAEUM OF JULY 4TH UNDER THE HEAD OF POETRY FOR THE MILLION CAME A SHORT REVIEW OF THE POEMS OF C E AND A
IF THE PRODUCE OF INDUSTRY COULD BE CONVEYED AT STATED TIMES TO THE CLOTH MARKET OF THE DISTRICT IT WAS ALL THAT COULD BE DONE
MY PREDECESSOR TOOK THE LIVING WITH THE CONSENT OF THE VICAR OF BRADFORD BUT IN OPPOSITION TO THE TRUSTEES
ASK HOWEVER FOR GEORGE O NED'S OR DICK O BOB'S OR TOM O JACK'S AS THE CASE MAY BE AND YOUR DIFFICULTY IS AT AN END
AS SOON AS I CAN GET AN ASSURANCE OF ONLY ONE PUPIL I WILL HAVE CARDS OF TERMS PRINTED AND WILL COMMENCE THE REPAIRS NECESSARY IN THE HOUSE
I DO WISH TO BE BETTER THAN I AM
CHARLOTTE'S OWN SHORT ACCOUNT OF THIS EVENT IS AS FOLLOWS MARTHA T.'S ILLNESS WAS UNKNOWN TO ME TILL THE DAY BEFORE SHE DIED
I IMAGINE MR BRONTE MUST HAVE FORMED SOME OF HIS OPINIONS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN FROM THESE TWO THEORISTS
THE GROUND ROUND ABOUT IS SOLD FOR BUILDING UPON
WHAT THE FUTURE HAS IN STORE I DO NOT KNOW MARCH 31ST 1846
I WON'T ANSWER YOUR KIND GENTLE FRIENDLY QUESTIONS IN THE WAY YOU WISH ME TO
AND IF SHE BE NOT QUITE SO TRACTABLE OR OPEN TO CONVICTION AS I COULD WISH I MUST REMEMBER PERFECTION IS NOT THE LOT OF HUMANITY
HOWEVER THOUGH I AM NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR UP CHEERFULLY I CAN STILL BEAR UP
THE YORK AND MIDLAND IS AS YOU SAY A VERY GOOD LINE YET I CONFESS TO YOU I SHOULD WISH FOR MY OWN PART TO BE WISE IN TIME
YOU CALL YOURSELF IDLE
AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR ORIGIN
A SOLITARY LIFE CHERISHES MERE FANCIES UNTIL THEY BECOME MANIAS
BUT HE HALF COMMANDED AND HALF ENTREATED HER TO REMAIN AND NURSE THEM
DURING THE HOURS OF RECREATION WHICH WERE ALWAYS SPENT IN THE GARDEN THEY INVARIABLY WALKED TOGETHER AND GENERALLY KEPT A PROFOUND SILENCE
MOON LIGHT WAS STILL AND THIS STIRRED PREPARED AS MY MIND WAS FOR HORROR SHAKEN AS MY NERVES WERE BY AGITATION I THOUGHT THE SWIFT-DARTING BEAM WAS A HERALD OF SOME COMING VISION FROM ANOTHER WORLD
BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU CAN RESPECT A PERSON BEFORE MARRIAGE MODERATE LOVE AT LEAST WILL COME AFTER
SHE SAYS IN THE STORY I SAT LOOKING AT THE WHITE BED AND OVERSHADOWED WALLS--OCCASIONALLY TURNING A FASCINATED EYE TOWARDS THE GLEAMING MIRROR--I BEGAN TO RECALL WHAT I HAD HEARD OF DEAD MEN TROUBLED IN THEIR GRAVES I ENDEAVOURED TO BE FIRM
THEY TRAVELLED NIGHT AND DAY AND GOT HOME ON A TUESDAY MORNING

I LOVE AND ADORE THEM
IF THE VARNISH IS LAID ON MUCH THICKER I AM AFRAID THE GOOD WOOD UNDERNEATH WILL BE QUITE CONCEALED AND YOUR YORKSHIRE FRIENDS WON'T STAND THAT
AFTER EXPLAINING HIS PLAN TO THEM HE AWAITED THEIR REPLY
WILL SOMETIMES CONCLUDE THAT SHE HAS A NATURAL IMPEDIMENT IN HER SPEECH
MR CARTWRIGHT WAS THE OWNER OF A FACTORY CALLED RAWFOLDS IN LIVERSEDGE NOT BEYOND THE DISTANCE OF A WALK FROM ROE HEAD
THESE WERE MOSTLY OF A SEDENTARY AND INTELLECTUAL NATURE
AT CERTAIN TIMES THE GIRLS WOULD BE SEWING IN THEIR AUNT'S BEDROOM--THE CHAMBER WHICH IN FORMER DAYS BEFORE THEY HAD OUTSTRIPPED HER IN THEIR LEARNING HAD SERVED THEM AS A SCHOOLROOM
AND YET A GENEROUS AND FULL CONFIDENCE NOT MISPLACED IN THE THOROUGH PROBITY OF MESSRS
INDEED THERE WAS NOT ROOM ENOUGH IN THE CHURCH EVEN FOR THE COMMUNICANTS
PAPA AND BRANWELL ARE GONE TO KEIGHLEY
AND HE THUS STRUCK AND DESOLATE SUFFERED AND BLED ALONE
I HAVE SAID THAT THE AIR OF DEWSBURY MOOR DID NOT AGREE WITH HER THOUGH SHE HERSELF WAS HARDLY AWARE HOW MUCH HER LIFE THERE WAS AFFECTING HER HEALTH
AS IS ALSO THAT OF A PAPER FROM THE SAME HAND ENTITLED THE ADVANTAGES OF POVERTY IN RELIGIOUS CONCERNS WHICH WAS WRITTEN RATHER LATER WITH A VIEW TO PUBLICATION IN SOME PERIODICAL
SHE NEVER SPOKE OF HER AUNT
AND WHENEVER I TURN BACK TO COMPARE WHAT I AM WITH WHAT I WAS--MY PLACE HERE WITH MY PLACE AT MRS S FOR INSTANCE--I AM THANKFUL
REGE
THEY PLACED HIM RIGHT BEFORE THE READING DESK WHERE HIS BLACKENED FACE NODDED A DRUNKEN STUPID ASSENT TO ALL THAT MR REDHEAD SAID
AND SOME ARE TO BE FOUND STILL IN THEIR INFANCY NOT A DOZEN MILES FROM HAWORTH THAT WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH LIFE AS LAMARTINE KOSSUTH AND DEMBINSKY
HE SOMETIMES GAVE OUT A VERY LONG PSALM TRADITION SAYS THE 119TH AND WHILE IT WAS BEING SUNG HE LEFT THE READING-DESK AND TAKING A HORSEWHIP WENT INTO THE PUBLIC-HOUSES AND FLOGGED THE LOITERERS INTO CHURCH
YOU ALWAYS LIKE TO USE YOUR MONEY TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE
AND THEN THEY WERE INDIGNANT WITH THEMSELVES FOR HAVING BEEN SUSCEPTIBLE OF THIS IMPRESSION AND THEIR STOUT PROTESTANT HEARTS ARRAYED THEMSELVES AGAINST THE FALSE DUESSA THAT HAD THUS IMPOSED UPON THEM
THE OTHER PUPILS DID NOT PERHAPS LOVE HER AS I DID SHE WAS SO QUIET AND SILENT
YOU DO NOT FORBID ME TO WRITE
SUCH GLIMPSES INTO THE INTERIOR AS A PASSER-BY OBTAINS REVEAL A ROUGH ABUNDANCE OF THE MEANS OF LIVING AND DILIGENT AND ACTIVE HABITS IN THE WOMEN
THE YORKSHIRE CHARACTER OF MR ROBERSON WOULD BE INCOMPLETE IF I DID NOT MENTION HIS FONDNESS FOR HORSES
THEY FELT THAT IT WAS A DUTY TO RELIEVE THEIR FATHER OF THE BURDEN OF THEIR SUPPORT IF NOT ENTIRELY OR THAT OF ALL THREE AT LEAST THAT OF ONE OR TWO
AND IF ANY TOUCH OF MISANTHROPY MINGLED WITH HIS VIEW OF MANKIND IN GENERAL HIS CONDUCT TO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO CAME IN PERSONAL CONTACT WITH HIM DID NOT AGREE WITH SUCH VIEW
BUT SHE DOES NOT KNOW MY CHARACTER AND SHE DOES NOT WISH TO KNOW IT
I LONG TO BE WITH YOU BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS IF TWO OR THREE DAYS OR WEEKS SPENT IN YOUR COMPANY WOULD BEYOND MEASURE STRENGTHEN ME IN THE ENJOYMENT OF THOSE FEELINGS WHICH I HAVE SO LATELY BEGUN TO CHERISH

AUGUST 7TH 1841
I POSITIVELY HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO YOU FOR I AM IN A STUPID HUMOUR
THE PATENT GRANTED TO ALDERMAN COCKAYNE AND THE FURTHER RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY JAMES I
AND SELDOM INDEED DO WE FIND IT
SHE IS NOT COLDER TO ME THAN SHE IS TO THE OTHER TEACHERS
HE NEVER COULD HAVE SHOWN HIS CELTIC DESCENT IN THE STRAIGHT GREEK LINES AND LONG OVAL OF HIS FACE
FOR SHE WAS A WARM-HEARTED AFFECTIONATE BEING AND I CARED FOR HER
I FIND IT SO DIFFICULT TO ASK EITHER SERVANTS OR MISTRESS FOR ANYTHING I WANT HOWEVER MUCH I WANT IT
AND IN TELLING THESE THINGS WITHOUT THE LEAST CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THERE MIGHT EVER BE ANYTHING REQUIRING TO BE SOFTENED DOWN WOULD GIVE AT FULL LENGTH THE BARE AND SIMPLE DETAILS
ET LUI BUONAPARTE IL A VOULU CREER NON PAS UN HOMME MAIS UN EMPIRE ET POUR DONNER UNE EXISTENCE UNE AME A SON OEUVRE GIGANTESQUE IL N'A PAS HESITE A ARRACHER LA VIE A DES NATIONS ENTIERES
PAPA AND AUNT ARE CONTINUALLY ADDUCING YOU AS AN EXAMPLE FOR ME TO SHAPE MY ACTIONS AND BEHAVIOUR BY
I SHALL START NO OBJECTIONS
THEIR COLOUR A REDDISH BROWN
AND ABOVE ALL THERE IS A CONSTANT SENSE OF SOLITUDE IN THE MIDST OF NUMBERS
IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT LYING AWAKE AT THE END OF THE LONG DESERTED DORMITORY IN THE VAST AND SILENT HOUSE EVERY FEAR RESPECTING THOSE WHOM SHE LOVED AND WHO WERE SO FAR OFF IN ANOTHER COUNTRY BECAME A TERRIBLE REALITY OPPRESSING HER AND CHOKING UP THE VERY LIFE-BLOOD IN HER HEART
WITHOUT IT SHE PERISHED
HALF-YEAR IN ADVANCE
THE SISTERS HAD TO LEAVE HOME AND EMILY TO RETURN TO HER DISTASTEFUL DUTIES WITHOUT KNOWING EVEN WHETHER CHARLOTTE'S LETTER HAD EVER REACHED ITS DESTINATION
THE OLD DOG ALWAYS COMES OUT OF HIS KENNEL AND WAGS HIS TAIL AND WHINES AFFECTIONATELY WHEN SOMEBODY PASSES FOR SOMEBODY AND HE READ CHARLOTTE BRONTE AND SHE HE QUIETLY STROKES THE CAT AND LETS HER SIT WHILE HE CONVENIENTLY CAN
PERHAPS I OUGHT IN THE BEGINNING TO HAVE HAD PRUDENCE SUFFICIENT TO SHUT MY EYES AGAINST SUCH A PROSPECT OF PLEASURE SO AS TO DENY MYSELF THE HOPE OF IT
I DISTINGUISH RESERVE FROM SHYNESS BECAUSE I IMAGINE SHYNESS WOULD PLEASE IF IT KNEW HOW
LEAVE TO MAN HIS PROPER DOOM
I SO LONGED TO INCREASE MY ATTAINMENTS--TO BECOME SOMETHING BETTER THAN I AM
YET I UNDERSTAND SHE PRAISES ME VERY MUCH TO EVERYBODY AND SAYS WHAT EXCELLENT LESSONS I GIVE
AND THE SAME TONE OF DESPONDENCY RUNS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING LETTER I WISH EXCEEDINGLY THAT I COULD COME TO YOU BEFORE CHRISTMAS BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
THE DEFENSIVE I THINK
SO HENCEFORTH HER WEEKLY HOLIDAY WOULD HAVE TO BE PASSED IN THE RUE D'ISABELLE OR SO SHE THOUGHT
DO NOT CONDEMN YOURSELF TO LIVE ONLY BY HALVES BECAUSE IF YOU SHOWED TOO MUCH ANIMATION SOME PRAGMATICAL THING IN BREECHES MIGHT TAKE IT INTO HIS PATE TO IMAGINE THAT YOU DESIGNED TO DEDICATE YOUR LIFE TO HIS INANITY
ET LES CROISES SE FIENT A SA PAROLE COMME LES ISRAELITES SE FIAIENT A CELLE DE MOISE ET DE JOSUE AS A COMPANION PORTRAIT TO THIS EMILY CHOSE TO DEPICT HAROLD ON THE EVE OF THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS
I WON'T TELL YOU OF YOUR FAULTS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THEM
IT IS SINGULAR HOW STRONG A YEARNING THE WHOLE FAMILY HAD TOWARDS THE ART OF DRAWING
AND MADAME HEGER AND THEIR CHILDREN
BOOTHS WERE ERECTED FOR THE SALE OF TOYS AND GINGERBREAD A SORT OF HOLY FAIR
IT IS ONLY ABSOLUTE WANT OF MEANS THAT ACTS AS ANY CHECK TO HIM
IN HER FIRST LETTER TO HIM DATED AUGUST 26TH SHE SEEMS ALMOST SURPRISED TO FIND HERSELF ENGAGED AND ALLUDES TO THE SHORT TIME WHICH SHE HAS KNOWN HIM
BUT IN THE COUNTRY SOME BRILLIANCY AND VIVIDNESS SEEMS TO BE INSTINCTIVELY EXPECTED AND THERE IS CONSEQUENTLY A SLIGHT FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE GREY NEUTRAL TINT OF EVERY OBJECT NEAR OR FAR OFF ON THE WAY FROM KEIGHLEY TO HAWORTH
CHAPTER II FOR A RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIFE OF MY DEAR FRIEND CHARLOTTE BRONTE IT APPEARS TO ME MORE NECESSARY IN HER CASE THAN IN MOST OTHERS THAT THE READER SHOULD BE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE PECULIAR FORMS OF POPULATION AND SOCIETY AMIDST WHICH HER EARLIEST YEARS WERE PASSED AND FROM WHICH BOTH HER OWN AND HER SISTERS FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF HUMAN LIFE MUST HAVE BEEN RECEIVED
DINNER-PARTIES WERE ALMOST UNKNOWN EXCEPTING AT THE ANNUAL FEAST-TIME
ALL HER LOVE WAS RESERVED FOR ANIMALS THE HELPLESSNESS OF AN ANIMAL WAS ITS PASSPORT TO CHARLOTTE'S HEART
THOU HEAREST THE SOUND THEREOF BUT CANST NOT TELL WHENCE IT COMETH NOR WHITHER IT GOETH THAT I BELIEVE IS SCRIPTURE THOUGH IN WHAT CHAPTER OR BOOK OR WHETHER IT BE CORRECTLY QUOTED I CAN'T POSSIBLY SAY
HENCE THERE IS MUCH CLOSE FRIENDSHIP AND FAITHFUL SERVICE
YOU MY DEAR MISS W KNOW FULL AS WELL AS I DO THE VALUE OF SISTERS AFFECTION TO EACH OTHER
LORD CHARLES WELLESLEY AND THE MARQUIS OF DOURO'S ADVENTURE
18
BUT FIRST I MUST STATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THIS CORNISH LADY MET THE SCHOLAR FROM AHADERG NEAR LOUGHBRICKLAND
SOME MAD METHODIST MAGAZINES FULL OF MIRACLES AND APPARITIONS AND PRETERNATURAL WARNINGS OMINOUS DREAMS AND FRENZIED FANATICISMS
THAT CHOICE FORTHWITH FELL ON MR BRONTE WHOSE PROMPTNESS AND PRUDENCE HAD WON THEIR HEARTS IN CONVERSING ON THE CHARACTER OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE WEST RIDING WITH DR SCORESBY WHO HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME VICAR OF BRADFORD HE ALLUDED TO CERTAIN RIOTOUS TRANSACTIONS WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE AT HAWORTH ON THE PRESENTATION OF THE LIVING TO MR REDHEAD AND SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN SO MUCH IN THE PARTICULARS INDICATIVE OF THE CHARACTER OF THE PEOPLE THAT HE ADVISED ME TO INQUIRE INTO THEM
SHE MISSED THE FRIENDS SHE HAD KNOWN FROM HER CHILDHOOD SOME OF WHOM HAD BEEN HER PARENTS FRIENDS BEFORE THEY WERE HERS
TO WHOM IT WAS WRITTEN MATTERS NOT
RULE 11
I RECOMMEND YOU TO DO WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO MYSELF THE REMAINDER OF THIS LETTER IS ONLY INTERESTING TO THE READER AS IT CONVEYS A PEREMPTORY DISCLAIMER OF THE REPORT THAT THE WRITER WAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO HER FATHER'S CURATE--THE VERY SAME GENTLEMAN TO WHOM EIGHT YEARS AFTERWARDS SHE WAS UNITED
THE LITTLE CHURCH LIES AS I MENTIONED ABOVE MOST OF THE HOUSES IN THE VILLAGE
I BELIEVE MANY OF THE YORKSHIREMEN WOULD OBJECT TO THE SYSTEM OF PAROCHIAL VISITING
BUT SHE BECAME LITERALLY ILL FROM HOME-SICKNESS AND COULD NOT SETTLE TO ANYTHING AND AFTER PASSING ONLY THREE MONTHS AT ROE HEAD RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND THE BELOVED MOORS
ANOTHER SQUIRE OF MORE DISTINGUISHED FAMILY AND LARGER PROPERTY--ONE IS THENCE LED TO IMAGINE OF BETTER EDUCATION BUT THAT DOES NOT ALWAYS FOLLOW--DIED AT HIS HOUSE NOT MANY MILES FROM HAWORTH ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO
10
WILD STRONG HEARTS AND POWERFUL MINDS WERE HIDDEN UNDER AN ENFORCED PROPRIETY AND REGULARITY OF DEMEANOUR AND EXPRESSION JUST AS THEIR FACES HAD BEEN CONCEALED BY THEIR FATHER UNDER HIS STIFF UNCHANGING MASK
SHE WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS AND WOULD ASK HOW THAT MENDED MATTERS AS THE FEELING WAS THERE ALL THE SAME AND WAS NOT REMOVED BY KNOWING THE CAUSE
THAT IF SHE SANK INTO DEEPER GLOOM SHE WOULD SOON NOT HAVE ENERGY TO GO AND SHE WAS TOO FAR FROM HOME FOR HER FRIENDS TO HEAR OF HER CONDITION AND ORDER HER HOME AS THEY HAD DONE FROM MISS W---'S
FOR NATURAL HISTORY READ BEWICK AND AUDUBON AND GOLDSMITH AND WHITE'S HISTORY OF SELBORNE
PEOPLE WENT ON HORSEBACK OVER THE UPLAND MOORS FOLLOWING THE TRACKS OF THE PACK-HORSES THAT CARRIED THE PARCELS BAGGAGE OR GOODS FROM ONE TOWN TO ANOTHER BETWEEN WHICH THERE DID NOT HAPPEN TO BE A HIGHWAY
HE IMMEDIATELY REPLIED MOST KINDLY EXPRESSING HIS FEAR THAT CHARLOTTE'S APPREHENSIONS AND ANXIETIES RESPECTING HER SISTER HAD LED HER TO GIVE UTTERANCE TO OVER EXCITED EXPRESSIONS OF ALARM
THIS WAS MR REDHEAD'S LAST APPEARANCE AT HAWORTH FOR MANY YEARS
HE ONLY CAN PRESENT

CHARLOTTE'S DEEP THOUGHTFUL SPIRIT APPEARS TO HAVE FELT ALMOST PAINFULLY THE TENDER RESPONSIBILITY WHICH RESTED UPON HER WITH REFERENCE TO HER REMAINING SISTERS
SHE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH MOST OF THE SHORT PIECES OF POETRY THAT WE HAD TO LEARN BY HEART
MOI JE SAIS CE QUE SONT CES GUERRES DONT L'EUROPE SAIGNE ENCORE COMME UNE VICTIME SOUS LE COUTEAU DU BOUCHER
AND IN RETURN I SUSPECT THE SHREWD SAGACIOUS ENERGETIC YORKSHIREMAN WOULD HOLD SUCH FOREIGNERS IN NO SMALL CONTEMPT
THE SHADES OF EVENING MADE HER RETRACE HER FOOTSTEPS--SICK FOR WANT OF FOOD BUT NOT HUNGRY
ALTHOUGH THE TITLE GIVEN TO HER DEVOIR IS ON THE DEATH OF NAPOLEON SHE SEEMS YET TO HAVE CONSIDERED IT A POINT OF HONOUR RATHER TO SING PRAISES TO AN ENGLISH HERO THAN TO DWELL ON THE CHARACTER OF A FOREIGNER PLACED AS SHE WAS AMONG THOSE WHO CARED LITTLE EITHER FOR AN ENGLAND OR FOR WELLINGTON
HUNTING SHOOTING WRESTLING COCK-FIGHTING GENERALLY ENDING IN DRUNKENNESS WERE WHAT THEY MOST DELIGHTED IN
AND SOME OF THE GIRLS URGED HER TO DO SO AND SAID THEY WOULD EXPLAIN IT ALL TO MISS TEMPLE THE SUPERINTENDENT
THESE ARE THE PANGS THAT RISE AROUND THE BED OF STATE AND GLOOM WHERE ADAM'S OFFSPRING DIES

AT ANY RATE HE HAD BEEN MUCH ABROAD AND SPOKE FRENCH WELL OF ITSELF A SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE BIGOTED NATIONALITY OF THOSE DAYS
MARY WAS GONE OFF ON HER OWN INDEPENDENT COURSE
BUT BEFORE REACHING THE MIDDLE OF THIS GLOWING DESCRIPTION SHE INTERRUPTS HERSELF TO DISCUSS FOR A MOMENT THE DOUBTS THAT HAVE BEEN THROWN ON THE MIRACULOUS RELATIONS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
AND THE SOFT SUMMER AIR BLOWING ROUND HER HOME THE SWEET COMPANY OF THOSE SHE LOVED THE RELEASE THE FREEDOM OF LIFE IN HER OWN FAMILY WERE NEEDED TO SAVE EITHER REASON OR LIFE

BUT I KNOW THE TREASURES OF THE BIBLE
I HOPE MADAME WON'T REFUSE TO GIVE THEM UP EXCUSE THE BREVITY OF THIS LETTER FOR I HAVE BEEN DRAWING ALL DAY AND MY EYES ARE SO TIRED IT IS QUITE A LABOUR TO WRITE BUT AS THE VIVID REMEMBRANCE OF THIS PLEASURE DIED AWAY AN ACCIDENT OCCURRED TO MAKE THE ACTUAL DUTIES OF LIFE PRESS SOMEWHAT HEAVILY FOR A TIME
I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THERE EVER WAS A FAMILY MORE TENDERLY BOUND TO EACH OTHER
MY INFORMANT ADDS:--"THE EFFECT OF THIS MANNER WAS SINGULAR
2ND 1829
OR PERHAPS THE DEEP PANG OF LOSING HER TWO ELDER SISTERS COMBINED WITH A PERMANENT STATE OF BODILY WEAKNESS IN PRODUCING HER HOPELESSNESS
IF IT HAD DEPENDED ON HER I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SOON BEEN AT LIBERTY
BUT THERE NEVER WERE SUCH GOOD CHILDREN
THEY NEVER TALKED MUCH
HE WAS TAKEN TO THE CLERK'S HOUSE AND AGAIN BECAME INSENSIBLE
IN THE SECOND SIXTY WAS ABOUT THE AVERAGE NUMBER--ALL FOREIGNERS EXCEPTING THE TWO BRONTES AND ONE OTHER
THE BAPTISTS HAD TAKEN THE LEAD IN INSTITUTING THEM THE WESLEYANS HAD FOLLOWED THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND HAD BROUGHT UP THE REAR
MR WILSON WAS NO DOUBT PLEASED BY THE IMPATIENCE WITH WHICH THE REALISATION OF HIS IDEA WAS ANTICIPATED AND OPENED THE SCHOOL WITH LESS THAN A HUNDRED POUNDS IN HAND AND WITH PUPILS THE NUMBER OF WHOM VARIES ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS
I DON'T DENY I SOMETIMES WISH TO BE IN ENGLAND OR THAT I HAVE BRIEF ATTACKS OF HOME SICKNESS
LE PAUVRE HERMITE VETU DU PAUVRE DE L'HUMBLE HABIT GRIS EST LA PLUS PUISSANT QIEUN ROI
SHE WAS LAUGHING AND TALKING VERY GAILY
THEY ARE NOT THE PRODUCTION OF A CLERGYMAN NOR ARE THEY EXCLUSIVELY OF A RELIGIOUS CHARACTER
WHATEVER HAD BEEN DISAGREEABLE OR OBNOXIOUS TO HER DURING THE DAY WAS PRESENTED WHEN IT WAS OVER WITH EXAGGERATED VIVIDNESS TO HER DISORDERED FANCY

TOUCHED AS CHARLOTTE WAS BY THE LETTER OF ST IGNATIUS BEFORE ALLUDED TO SHE CLAIMED EQUAL SELF-DEVOTION AND FROM AS HIGH A MOTIVE FOR SOME OF THE MISSIONARIES OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH SENT OUT TO TOIL AND TO PERISH ON THE POISONOUS AFRICAN COAST AND WROTE AS AN IMITATION LETTRE D'UN MISSIONNAIRE SIERRA LEONE AFRIQUE SOMETHING OF HER FEELING TOO APPEARS IN THE FOLLOWING LETTER BRUSSELS 1842
FOR A SHORT DISTANCE THE ROAD APPEARS TO TURN AWAY FROM HAWORTH AS IT WINDS ROUND THE BASE OF THE SHOULDER OF A HILL
FOLLOWING MY FATHER'S ADVICE--WHO FROM MY CHILDHOOD HAS COUNSELLED ME JUST IN THE WISE AND FRIENDLY TONE OF YOUR LETTER--I HAVE ENDEAVOURED NOT ONLY ATTENTIVELY TO OBSERVE ALL THE DUTIES A WOMAN OUGHT TO FULFIL BUT TO FEEL DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THEM
THE SEARCH AFTER HAPPINESS A TALE AUG
THE HOUSELESS AND THE POOR PERHAPS THE LEPROUS WERE RECEIVED BY THE BRETHREN OF A RELIGIOUS ORDER IN A BUILDING ON THIS SHELTERED SITE
THEY DID NOT GET HOME TILL HALF-PAST FOUR AND WERE CAUGHT IN THE HEAVY SHOWER OF RAIN WHICH FELL IN THE AFTERNOON
MINE DEAR LOVE MINE-BONNIE LOVE ARE HER TERMS OF ADDRESS TO THIS BELOVED SISTER
MR BRONTE HAD BUT A SMALL STIPEND AND WAS BOTH CHARITABLE AND LIBERAL
AT SUCH TIMES--IN SUCH MOODS AS THESE--IT IS MY NATURE TO SEEK REPOSE IN SOME CALM TRANQUIL IDEA AND I HAVE NOW SUMMONED UP YOUR IMAGE TO GIVE ME REST
THIS WAS TO THE FRONT THE STAIRCASE GOING UP RIGHT OPPOSITE TO THE ENTRANCE
IF WE HAD I WOULD CHOOSE THE ISLAND OF MAN CHARLOTTE
HER BRUSSELS LIFE MUST HAVE SEEMED LIKE A DREAM SO COMPLETELY IN THIS SHORT SPACE OF TIME DID SHE FALL BACK INTO THE OLD HOUSEHOLD WAYS
THE SMALL PROPERTY WHICH SHE HAD ACCUMULATED BY DINT OF PERSONAL FRUGALITY AND SELF-DENIAL WAS BEQUEATHED TO HER NIECES
IT OCCUPIED THE THIRD OR LOWEST CLASS OF ECCLESIASTICAL STRUCTURES ACCORDING TO THE SAXON LAW AND HAD NO RIGHT OF SEPULTURE OR ADMINISTRATION OF SACRAMENTS
DAY AFTER DAY THERE WAS A LITTLE HOPE FELT BY THE SISTERS UNTIL THE POST CAME IN
HE AND HIS SISTER CHARLOTTE WERE BOTH SLIGHT AND SMALL OF STATURE WHILE THE OTHER TWO WERE OF TALLER AND LARGER MAKE
I SPENT A WEEK AT H NOT VERY PLEASANTLY
HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST AMIABLE AND WORTHY OF MEN A MAN TO MYSELF ENDEARED BY MANY TIES AND OBLIGATIONS
BRONTE A.B INCUMBENT SHE DIED MARCH 31ST 1855 IN THE 39TH YEAR OF HER AGE
IT WAS FOR THE THREE SISTERS LOVING EACH OTHER WITH SO PASSIONATE AN AFFECTION TO BE TOGETHER UNDER ONE ROOF AND YET EARNING THEIR OWN SUBSISTENCE
WHITAKER SAYS THAT THIS MISTAKE ORIGINATED IN THE ILLITERATE COPYING OUT BY SOME MODERN STONE-CUTTER OF AN INSCRIPTION IN THE CHARACTER OF HENRY THE EIGHTH'S TIME ON AN ADJOINING STONE ORATE PRO BONO STATU EUTEST TOD NOW EVERY ANTIQUARY KNOWS THAT THE FORMULA OF PRAYER BONO STATU ALWAYS REFERS TO THE LIVING
MOREOVER THIS STERN FEARLESS CLERGYMAN HAD THE SOLDIERS THAT WERE SENT TO DEFEND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BILLETED AT HIS HOUSE
SO RUNS THE ACCOUNT ACCORDING TO ONE AUTHORITY
HEGER GAVE HER A KIND OF DIPLOMA DATED FROM AND SEALED WITH THE SEAL OF THE ATHENEE ROYAL DE BRUXELLES CERTIFYING THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF TEACHING THE FRENCH LANGUAGE HAVING WELL STUDIED THE GRAMMAR AND COMPOSITION THEREOF AND MOREOVER HAVING PREPARED HERSELF FOR TEACHING BY STUDYING AND PRACTISING THE BEST METHODS OF INSTRUCTION
THE SAME TAWNY BULL-DOG WITH HIS STRANGLED WHISTLE CALLED TARTAR IN SHIRLEY WAS KEEPER IN HAWORTH PARSONAGE
THEY HAD MEANS SUFFICIENT FOR THEIR UNAMBITIOUS WANTS
BUT IN GENERAL NOTWITHSTANDING THAT MISS BRANWELL MIGHT BE OCCASIONALLY UNREASONABLE SHE AND HER NIECES WENT ON SMOOTHLY ENOUGH
HEGER INFORMS ME THAT ON RECEIPT OF A LETTER FROM CHARLOTTE MAKING VERY PARTICULAR INQUIRIES AS TO THE POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF WHAT ARE USUALLY TERMED EXTRAS HE AND HIS WIFE WERE SO MUCH STRUCK BY THE SIMPLE EARNEST TONE OF THE LETTER THAT THEY SAID TO EACH OTHER:--"THESE ARE THE DAUGHTERS OF AN ENGLISH PASTOR OF MODERATE MEANS ANXIOUS TO LEARN WITH AN ULTERIOR VIEW OF INSTRUCTING OTHERS AND TO WHOM THE RISK OF ADDITIONAL EXPENSE IS OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE
10_S
THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF PLAYING AT FOOT-BALL ON SUNDAY USING STONES FOR THIS PURPOSE
YOUR MORAL AND SPIRITUAL IMPROVEMENT WILL THEN KEEP PACE WITH THE CULTURE OF YOUR INTELLECTUAL POWERS
AND LEAVING THE OLD PLODDING LIFE OF A LANDOWNER WITH SMALL CAPITAL HE TURNS MANUFACTURER OR DIGS FOR COAL OR QUARRIES FOR STONE
I CAN NEVER DO BETTER THAN I HAVE DONE AND I HAVE DONE NOTHING YET AT SUCH TIMES SHE SEEMED TO THINK THAT MOST HUMAN BEINGS WERE DESTINED BY THE PRESSURE OF WORLDLY INTERESTS TO LOSE ONE FACULTY AND FEELING AFTER ANOTHER TILL THEY WENT DEAD ALTOGETHER
THE SOFT CURVING AND HEAVING LANDSCAPE ROUND THE FORMER GIVES A STRANGER THE IDEA OF CHEERFUL AIRINESS ON THE HEIGHTS AND OF SUNNY WARMTH IN THE BROAD GREEN VALLEYS BELOW
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE NATURE AND DEPTH OF BRANWELL'S SINS,--WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS TEMPTATION WHATEVER HIS GUILT,--THERE IS NO DOUBT OF THE SUFFERING WHICH HIS CONDUCT ENTAILED UPON HIS POOR FATHER AND HIS INNOCENT SISTERS
SHE SAYS HER CHARACTER IS IMPLICATED GOOD KIND MISS W
A BOOK OF RHYMES FINISHED DECEMBER 17TH 1829
HAWORTH JULY 4TH 1834
EMILY WAS IMPERVIOUS TO INFLUENCE
HE WAS WITHIN WALLS IT IS TRUE
HE DESIRES ME TO SAY THAT THE BRIDEGROOM IS COMING AND THAT WE MUST PREPARE TO MEET HIM
SHE SO AVOIDED PARTICULARIZING THAT I THINK MR CARUS WILSON'S NAME NEVER PASSED BETWEEN US
IMAGINE ME DOING SO AND THEN CONSIDER WHAT EPITHETS YOU WOULD BESTOW ON ME
WITH THE HELP OF GOD I WILL TRY TO DENY MYSELF IN THIS MATTER AND TO WAIT
LEURS QUALITES PERSONNELLES LEUR BON VOULOIR LEUR ZELE EXTREME SONT LES SEULES CAUSES QUI NOUS POUSSENT A NOUS HASARDER DE LA SORTE
A SHORT EXTRACT FROM A LETTER WRITTEN TO ME BY A FRENCH LADY RESIDENT IN BRUSSELS AND WELL QUALIFIED TO JUDGE WILL HELP TO SHOW THE ESTIMATION IN WHICH HE IS HELD
31 MAI 1843
HER SOUL DEPARTED TO THE SAVIOUR SEPT
THE STRONG YEARNING TO GO HOME CAME UPON HER
SO THOUGH I COULD BATTLE OUT AUNT'S DISCONTENT I YIELD TO PAPA'S INDULGENCE
AND THAT THIS IN BOTH CASES CONSIDERING HOW LITTLE PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH THEY HAD WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT BRUSSELS IN FEBRUARY AND THAT THEY WROTE WITHOUT THE AID OF DICTIONARY OR GRAMMAR IS UNUSUAL AND REMARKABLE
EVEN THE BELIEF IN WITCHES MAINTAINED ITS GROUND AND THERE WAS AN ALMOST UNBOUNDED CREDULITY RESPECTING THE SUPERNATURAL AND MONSTROUS
BUT THIS IS A DIGRESSION C C
SAYS WOULD BE AS ELIGIBLE A PLACE AS ANY
AND ALL WENT SMOOTHLY AND SUCCESSFULLY WITH A VIEW TO THEIR MARRIAGE IN THE ENSUING WINTER UNTIL NOVEMBER WHEN A MISFORTUNE HAPPENED WHICH SHE THUS PATIENTLY AND PRETTILY DESCRIBES I SUPPOSE YOU NEVER EXPECTED TO BE MUCH THE RICHER FOR ME BUT I AM SORRY TO INFORM YOU THAT I AM STILL POORER THAN I THOUGHT MYSELF
THE HUSH
THEY MADE THEIR OPINIONS KNOWN WHEN ROUSED BY ANY INJUSTICE
AND KNOWING WELL THAT PAPA WOULD HAVE ENOUGH TO DO WITH HIS LIMITED INCOME SHOULD BRANWELL BE PLACED AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY AND EMILY AT ROE HEAD
SHE ASKED PAPA'S ADVICE
AND ON ALL OCCASIONS TREATED HIM WITH AS MUCH CIVILITY AS I WAS MISTRESS OF
I WISH YOU COULD KNOW THE THRILL OF DELIGHT WHICH I EXPERIENCED WHEN AS I STOOD AT THE DINING ROOM WINDOW I SAW AS HE WHIRLED PAST TOSS YOUR LITTLE PACKET OVER THE WALL HUDDERSFIELD MARKET-DAY WAS STILL THE GREAT PERIOD FOR EVENTS AT ROE HEAD
WINTER
CHARLOTTE WROTE THUS ON JANUARY 12TH 1840 YOUR LETTER WHICH I RECEIVED THIS MORNING WAS ONE OF PAINFUL INTEREST
BUT I MUST DO IT
BUT SO STRONG WAS THE DEMOCRATIC ELEMENT THAT HE MET WITH THE MOST VIOLENT OPPOSITION AND WAS OFTEN INSULTED WHEN HE WENT INTO THE STREET
AND BRANWELL INFORMED THE LONDONER OF ONE OR TWO SHORT CUTS FROM POINT TO POINT UP NARROW LANES OR BACK STREETS
FOR FICTION READ SCOTT ALONE
WHAT SHALL I DO WITHOUT YOU
MARCH 3RD 1841
YET WHERE I AM HE SHALL ALWAYS FIND RATHER A DEFENDER THAN AN ACCUSER
MY CONSCIENCE WILL NOT LET ME BE EITHER A PUSEYITE OR A HOOKIST
THE FAMILY OF HIM WHO DIED DURING THE YEAR THAT HE WAS KING WERE BOUND TO PRESENT THE DECORATION TO THE CHURCH OF THE PATRON SAINT OF THE GUILD AND TO FURNISH A SIMILAR PRIZE TO BE CONTENDED FOR AFRESH
IF WE BOTH LIVE THIS PERIOD OF OUR LIVES WILL LONG BE A THEME FOR PLEASANT RECOLLECTION
SOIT
MRS BRONTE WHOSE SWEET NATURE THOUGHT INVARIABLY OF THE BRIGHT SIDE WOULD SAY OUGHT I NOT TO BE THANKFUL THAT HE NEVER GAVE ME AN ANGRY WORD MR BRONTE WAS AN ACTIVE WALKER STRETCHING AWAY OVER THE MOORS FOR MANY MILES NOTING IN HIS MIND ALL NATURAL SIGNS OF WIND AND WEATHER AND KEENLY OBSERVING ALL THE WILD CREATURES THAT CAME AND WENT IN THE LONELIEST SWEEPS OF THE HILLS
WE MADE HER TRY BUT SOON FOUND THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE THE BALL SO WE PUT HER OUT
BUT THIS WAS A SACRED PIOUS CHARGE THE DUTIES OF WHICH SHE WAS BLESSED IN FULFILLING
AMONG THE POOR THE MOURNERS WERE ONLY EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A KIND OF SPICED ROLL FOR EACH PERSON
EMILY'S AND MY BEST PLAYS WERE ESTABLISHED THE 1ST OF DECEMBER 1827
THE WOUNDED STAG
FAITHFUL AND PERSEVERING IN FOLLOWING OUT A GOOD PURPOSE FELL IN TRACKING AN EVIL ONE
AND I CAN PERCEIVE THEY HAVE ALREADY EXCITED MUCH SPITE AND JEALOUSY IN THE SCHOOL
AND AT LAST WE HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SEND HIM FROM HOME FOR A WEEK WITH SOME ONE TO LOOK AFTER HIM
BUT WHEN THE TIME OF THE LATTER WAS TAKEN UP WITH HIS PAROCHIAL DUTIES THE BOY WAS THROWN INTO CHANCE COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LADS OF THE VILLAGE--FOR YOUTH WILL TO YOUTH AND BOYS WILL TO BOYS
CHARLOTTE REPLIES I SHOULD HESITATE TO EXPRESS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION FROM MR OR FROM YOUR EXCELLENT SISTER BUT REALLY THE MATTER SEEMS TO ME TO STAND THUS
MR FENNEL HER UNCLE ALSO WRITES TO THEM BY THE SAME POST IN PRAISE OF MR BRONTE
BUT HER HOPE STOOD STILL WANED AND HAD ALMOST DISAPPEARED BEFORE AFTER MANY DELAYS IT WAS REALISED
YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN SUCH INSTANCES

VOILA L'UNION QU'IL FAUT BRISER LA VOIX DES TIMIDES ET DES TRAITRES PROTESTA CONTRE CETTE SENTENCE
HE ANSWERED BY CONSIDERING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AS TO THEIR BODIES I THEN ASKED CHARLOTTE WHAT WAS THE BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD
THE TWO SISTERS CLUNG TOGETHER AND KEPT APART FROM THE HERD OF HAPPY BOISTEROUS WELL-BEFRIENDED BELGIAN GIRLS WHO IN THEIR TURN THOUGHT THE NEW ENGLISH PUPILS WILD AND SCARED-LOOKING WITH STRANGE ODD INSULAR IDEAS ABOUT DRESS
EVERY SPOT TOLD AN HISTORIC TALE EXTENDING BACK INTO THE FABULOUS AGES WHEN JAN AND JANNIKA THE ABORIGINAL GIANT AND GIANTESS LOOKED OVER THE WALL FORTY FEET HIGH OF WHAT IS NOW THE RUE VILLA HERMOSA AND PEERED DOWN UPON THE NEW SETTLERS WHO WERE TO TURN THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY HAD LIVED SINCE THE DELUGE

AND MRS
AND THE COUNTRY IN THE OPINION OF MANY SEEMED TO BE ON THE VERGE OF A PRECIPICE FROM WHICH IT WAS ONLY SAVED BY THE PROMPT AND RESOLUTE DECISION OF A FEW IN AUTHORITY
TO BRANWELL IT WAS MORE THAN A VIVID IMAGINATION IT WAS AN IMPRESSED REALITY
AND IN THESE LARGE ESTABLISHMENTS THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THEIR ORDINARY COURSE FOR ONE OR TWO STRANGERS
BUT AT FIVE-AND-TWENTY FRESH FROM THE ONLY LIFE HE HAD EVER KNOWN TO PRESENT HIMSELF AT THE GATES OF ST JOHN'S PROVED NO LITTLE DETERMINATION OF WILL AND SCORN OF RIDICULE
HE SPEAKS OF THE WITHDRAWAL FROM DECLINING HEALTH OF AN EYE WHICH AT ALL EVENTS HAS LOVED TO WATCH OVER THE SCHOOLS WITH AN HONEST AND ANXIOUS INTEREST;"--AND AGAIN HE ADDS THAT HE RESIGNS THEREFORE WITH A DESIRE TO BE THANKFUL FOR ALL THAT GOD HAS BEEN PLEASED TO ACCOMPLISH THROUGH HIS INSTRUMENTALITY THE INFIRMITIES AND UNWORTHINESSES OF WHICH HE DEEPLY FEELS AND DEPLORES COWAN BRIDGE IS A CLUSTER OF SOME SIX OR SEVEN COTTAGES GATHERED TOGETHER AT BOTH ENDS OF A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE HIGH ROAD FROM LEEDS TO KENDAL CROSSES A LITTLE STREAM CALLED THE LECK
BUT THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE ARE HARD AND THEIR TONES DISCORDANT PROMISING LITTLE OF THE MUSICAL TASTE THAT DISTINGUISHES THE DISTRICT AND WHICH HAS ALREADY FURNISHED A CARRODUS TO THE MUSICAL WORLD

THE READERS OF SHIRLEY WILL RECOGNISE THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WERE RELATED TO MISS BRONTE YEARS AFTER THEY OCCURRED BUT ON THE VERY SPOTS WHERE THEY TOOK PLACE AND BY PERSONS WHO REMEMBERED FULL WELL THOSE TERRIBLE TIMES OF INSECURITY TO LIFE AND PROPERTY ON THE ONE HAND AND OF BITTER STARVATION AND BLIND IGNORANT DESPAIR ON THE OTHER
AND IF THEY PRODUCE NO IMMEDIATE AND TANGIBLE RESULT THEY ARE RATHER PUT ASIDE AS UNFIT FOR THIS BUSY STRIVING WORLD
AND THE NECESSITY OF THEIR GIVING WAY TO HIM IN SOME THINGS IS TOO OFTEN EXAGGERATED INTO THEIR GIVING WAY TO HIM IN ALL AND THUS RENDERING HIM UTTERLY SELFISH

NO LESS THAN SEVEN MASTERS ATTEND TO TEACH THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF EDUCATION--FRENCH DRAWING MUSIC SINGING WRITING ARITHMETIC AND GERMAN
IT WAS GIVEN BY THE POET TO MR QUILLINAN IN 1850 AFTER THE NAME OF BRONTE HAD BECOME KNOWN AND FAMOUS
THEN CAME THE ARISTOCRATIC GUILD OF THE CROSS-BOW MEN--THAT COMPANY THE MEMBERS WHEREOF WERE REQUIRED TO PROVE THEIR NOBLE DESCENT--UNTAINTED FOR SO MANY GENERATIONS BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED INTO THE GUILD
I SPOKE WITH AN AGED AND TRIED WOMAN AT ONE TIME WHO AFTER RECORDING HER MERCIES STATED AMONG OTHERS HER POWERS OF SPEECH BY ASSERTING THANK THE LORD AH NIVVER WOR A MEILLY-MEOUTHED WUMMAN I FEEL PARTICULARLY AT FAULT IN ATTEMPTING THE ORTHOGRAPHY OF THE DIALECT BUT MUST EXCUSE MYSELF BY TELLING YOU THAT I ONCE SAW A LETTER IN WHICH THE WORD I HAVE JUST NOW USED EXCUSE WAS WRITTEN ECKSQUEAIZE THERE ARE SOME THINGS HOWEVER WHICH RATHER TEND TO SOFTEN THE IDEA OF THE RUDENESS OF HAWORTH

WELL HIS WIFE ELECT APPEARED TO ME TO BE A CLEVER AND AMIABLE LADY AS FAR AS I COULD JUDGE FROM THE LITTLE I SAW OF HER AND FROM YOUR ACCOUNT
AMONGST THE MIDDLE AND HIGHER CLASSES THERE WAS LITTLE TASTE FOR LITERATURE AND STILL LESS FOR SCIENCE AND THEIR PURSUITS WERE RARELY OF A DIGNIFIED OR INTELLECTUAL KIND

DURING THE BITTER COLD WEATHER WE HAD THROUGH FEBRUARY AND THE PRINCIPAL PART OF MARCH I DID NOT REGRET THAT YOU HAD NOT ACCOMPANIED ME
THESE NOBLE CROSS-BOW MEN OF THE MIDDLE AGES FORMED A SORT OF ARMED GUARD TO THE POWERS IN EXISTENCE AND ALMOST INVARIABLY TOOK THE ARISTOCRATIC IN PREFERENCE TO THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IN THE NUMEROUS CIVIL DISSENSIONS OF THE FLEMISH TOWNS
REMARKED THAT SHE THOUGHT THE TERMS VERY MODERATE BUT THAT AS IT IS NOT HAVING HOUSE-RENT TO PAY WE CAN OFFER THE SAME PRIVILEGES OF EDUCATION THAT ARE TO BE HAD IN EXPENSIVE SEMINARIES AT LITTLE MORE THAN HALF THEIR PRICE
I NEVER HOPE TO SEE IN THIS WORLD A CHARACTER MORE TRULY NOBLE

THE PARISH OF HALIFAX TOUCHES THAT OF BRADFORD IN WHICH THE CHAPELRY OF HAWORTH IS INCLUDED
IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH HE WAS SO OPPOSED THAT AFTER ONLY THREE WEEKS POSSESSION HE WAS COMPELLED TO RESIGN A YORKSHIRE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS KINDLY SENT ME SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT SINCE THE SECOND EDITION OF MY WORK WAS PUBLISHED WRITE THUS THE SOLE RIGHT OF PRESENTATION TO THE INCUMBENCY OF HAWORTH IS VESTED IN THE VICAR OF BRADFORD
BUT IN SLOW TREMBLING MOVEMENTS WITH MANY A PAUSE SHE WENT DOWN-STAIRS AT LAST,--AND WAS PUNISHED FOR BEING LATE
ALL IN THE HOUSE WERE LOOKING TO YOUR VISIT WITH EAGERNESS
AND THE ROWS OF HOUSES BUILT OF IT HAVE A KIND OF SOLID GRANDEUR CONNECTED WITH THEIR UNIFORM AND ENDURING LINES
SHE LEFT IT TWICE AGAIN IN HER LIFE
BEHIND THE FORMER A SORT OF FLAGGED STORE-ROOM
AND THE DUTIES THAT NOW FELL UPON HER SEEMED ALMOST LIKE A LEGACY FROM THE GENTLE LITTLE SUFFERER SO LATELY DEAD

THE HOUSE CONSISTS OF FOUR ROOMS ON EACH FLOOR AND IS TWO STORIES HIGH
THE CHAPEL OR CHURCH CLAIMS GREATER ANTIQUITY THAN ANY OTHER IN THAT PART OF THE KINGDOM
THEY USED TO BUY A GREAT DEAL OF WRITING PAPER AND I USED TO WONDER WHATEVER THEY DID WITH SO MUCH
SO CHARLOTTE AS THE ELDEST RESOLVED TO WRITE TO SOUTHEY
AGAIN THE COUSINS OF THESE FRIENDS WERE RESIDENT IN THE TOWN
WHEN PAPA CAME HOME IT WAS NIGHT AND WE WERE IN BED SO NEXT MORNING BRANWELL CAME TO OUR DOOR WITH A BOX OF SOLDIERS
BUT I DO NOT PRETEND TO BE ABLE TO HARMONIZE POINTS OF CHARACTER AND ACCOUNT FOR THEM AND BRING THEM ALL INTO ONE CONSISTENT AND INTELLIGIBLE WHOLE
AT LEAST IN ALL OF THEM WHICH I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO READ
ON THE SAME BY A DIFFERENT HAND
CORDIALITY IN EACH IS THE PROMINENT CHARACTERISTIC
BESIDES CLOTHES TO REPAIR
EXPRESSIVE OF I BELIEVE SINCERE REGRET THAT I HAD NOT INFORMED THEM A MONTH SOONER IN WHICH CASE HE SAID THEY WOULD GLADLY HAVE SENT ME THEIR OWN DAUGHTER AND ALSO COLONEL S.'S BUT THAT NOW BOTH WERE PROMISED TO MISS C
ONE OTHER ILLUSTRATION OF HIS CHARACTER MAY BE GIVEN
IT MAY ALL DIE AWAY AND I MAY BE IN UTTER MIDNIGHT BUT I IMPLORE A MERCIFUL REDEEMER THAT IF THIS BE THE DAWN OF THE GOSPEL IT MAY STILL BRIGHTEN TO PERFECT DAY
HE TOOK OPIUM BECAUSE IT MADE HIM FORGET FOR A TIME MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN DRINK
CHARLOTTE'S QUIET GENTLE MANNER NEVER CHANGED
MATTERS HOWEVER ARE NOW A LITTLE CHANGED
THEY BROKE IT OPEN
THE FORMER IT IS TRUE HAD THE HAPPINESS OF HAVING A FRIEND FOR HER EMPLOYER AND OF BEING SURROUNDED BY THOSE WHO KNEW HER AND LOVED HER
THE CHILDREN ARE UNDER DECENT CONTROL THE SERVANTS ARE VERY OBSERVANT AND ATTENTIVE TO ME AND THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF THE MASTER AND MISTRESS RELIEVES ME FROM THE DUTY OF ALWAYS ENDEAVOURING TO SEEM CHEERFUL AND CONVERSABLE
HEGER'S EXPRESSION ELLE ETAIT NOURRIE DE LA BIBLE AFTER HE HAD READ DE LA VIGNE'S POEM ON JOAN OF ARC SHE CHOSE THE VISION AND DEATH OF MOSES ON MOUNT NEBO TO WRITE ABOUT
MISS W FELT THESE REPROACHES KEENLY AND WROTE TO MR BRONTE ABOUT THEM
BUT HIS TONE OF THOUGHT AND CONVERSATION BECAME GRADUALLY COARSER AND FOR A TIME HIS SISTERS TRIED TO PERSUADE THEMSELVES THAT SUCH COARSENESS WAS A PART OF MANLINESS AND TO BLIND THEMSELVES BY LOVE TO THE FACT THAT BRANWELL WAS WORSE THAN OTHER YOUNG MEN
FOR THE SELFISH EXCITEMENT OF EMULATION
YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO CHOOSE THE GOOD AND TO AVOID THE EVIL
I NEVER DO TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SAID TO BE LIKE ME BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS A NOTION THAT THEY ARE ONLY LIKE ME IN THE DISAGREEABLE OUTSIDE FIRST-ACQUAINTANCE PART OF MY CHARACTER
CHIEF GENII IN COUNCIL
SHE AND HER FRIEND WENT TO EASTON FOR A FORTNIGHT IN THE LATTER PART OF SEPTEMBER
FIRST COME SOME VILLAS
HE LIVED NEAR HECKMONDWIKE A LARGE STRAGGLING DIRTY VILLAGE NOT TWO MILES FROM ROE HEAD
SHE DESCRIBED HERSELF AS HAVING THE MOST PAINFUL SENSE OF PITY FOR THE LITTLE THING LYING INERT AS SICK CHILDREN DO WHILE SHE WALKED ABOUT IN SOME GLOOMY PLACE WITH IT SUCH AS THE AISLE OF HAWORTH CHURCH
CHARLOTTE'S FRIEND CAME OVER TO SEE HER AND SHE RETURNED THE VISIT
THE QUESTION WAS TO WHAT TRADE OR PROFESSION SHOULD BRANWELL BE BROUGHT UP
I BEGIN TO PERCEIVE THAT I HAVE TOO LITTLE LIFE IN ME NOW-A-DAYS TO BE FIT COMPANY FOR ANY EXCEPT VERY QUIET PEOPLE
SEEM TO ME GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE
I HAVE SEEN MARTHA'S GRAVE--THE PLACE WHERE HER ASHES LIE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY WHO THAT HAS READ SHIRLEY DOES NOT REMEMBER THE FEW LINES--PERHAPS HALF A PAGE--OF SAD RECOLLECTION
THERE WAS SOME FAMILY TRADITION THAT HUMBLE AS HUGH BRONTE'S CIRCUMSTANCES WERE HE WAS THE DESCENDANT OF AN ANCIENT FAMILY
BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE GAVE THEM ANY DIRECT INSTRUCTION
BUT I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO KNOW HOW THE GREAT BREWING-TUB OF BRIDLINGTON BAY WORKS AND WHAT SORT OF YEASTY FROTH RISES JUST NOW ON THE WAVES
I BEGAN TO READ--A FEELING STOLE OVER ME SUCH AS I HAVE NOT KNOWN FOR MANY LONG YEARS--A SWEET PLACID SENSATION LIKE THOSE I REMEMBER WHICH USED TO VISIT ME WHEN I WAS A LITTLE CHILD AND ON SUNDAY EVENINGS IN SUMMER STOOD BY THE OPEN WINDOW READING THE LIFE OF A CERTAIN FRENCH NOBLEMAN WHO ATTAINED A PURER AND HIGHER DEGREE OF SANCTITY THAN HAS BEEN KNOWN SINCE THE DAYS OF THE EARLY MARTYRS E.'S RESIDENCE WAS EQUALLY WITHIN A WALK FROM DEWSBURY MOOR AS IT HAD BEEN FROM ROE HEAD
I BELIEVE SHE HERSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THE OVER-STRONG IMPRESSION WHICH WAS MADE UPON THE PUBLIC MIND BY HER VIVID PICTURE THOUGH EVEN SHE SUFFERING HER WHOLE LIFE LONG BOTH IN HEART AND BODY FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN APT TO THE LAST TO TAKE HER DEEP BELIEF IN FACTS FOR THE FACTS THEMSELVES--HER CONCEPTION OF TRUTH FOR THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH
THAT MUST INDEED BE A DEPRAVED MIND WHICH CAN GATHER EVIL FROM HENRY VIII FROM RICHARD III FROM MACBETH AND HAMLET AND JULIUS CAESAR
HOWEVER YOU ARE NOT TO BLAME AND AS TO DISAPPOINTMENT WHY ALL MUST SUFFER DISAPPOINTMENT AT SOME PERIOD OR OTHER OF THEIR LIVES

OWING TO SOME ILLNESS OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS MR BRONTE WAS OBLIGED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HIS DIET
IS IT NOT ODD
THE PATH FROM COWAN BRIDGE TO TUNSTALL CHURCH WHERE MR WILSON PREACHED AND WHERE THEY ALL ATTENDED ON THE SUNDAY IS MORE THAN TWO MILES IN LENGTH AND GOES SWEEPING ALONG THE RISE AND FALL OF THE UNSHELTERED COUNTRY IN A WAY TO MAKE IT A FRESH AND EXHILARATING WALK IN SUMMER BUT A BITTER COLD ONE IN WINTER ESPECIALLY TO CHILDREN LIKE THE DELICATE LITTLE BRONTES WHOSE THIN BLOOD FLOWED LANGUIDLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR FEEBLE APPETITES REJECTING THE FOOD PREPARED FOR THEM AND THUS INDUCING A HALF STARVED CONDITION
B I CANNOT DENY MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION OF INSERTING SOUTHEY'S REPLY KESWICK MARCH 22 1837
BUT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS A HAPPY VISIT TO ALL PARTIES
SOUTHEY IN HIS REPLY TO HER FIRST LETTER HAD APPEALED TO THE HIGHER PARTS OF HER NATURE IN CALLING HER TO CONSIDER WHETHER LITERATURE WAS OR WAS NOT THE BEST COURSE FOR A WOMAN TO PURSUE
YOU MUST EXCUSE THIS LETTER NOT BEING QUITE AS LONG AS YOUR OWN
THE DELICATE LONG FINGERS HAD A PECULIAR FINENESS OF SENSATION WHICH WAS ONE REASON WHY ALL HER HANDIWORK OF WHATEVER KIND--WRITING SEWING KNITTING--WAS SO CLEAR IN ITS MINUTENESS
IN EXTREME EXCITEMENT I WROTE A LETTER HOME WHICH CARRIED THE DAY
GREAT TRACTS OF BLEAK LAND ENCLOSED BY STONE DYKES SWEEPING UP CLAYTON HEIGHTS
AU REVEREND MONSIEUR BRONTE PASTEUR EVANGELIQUE C C
THE NETTLES THE LONG GRASS AND THE TOMBS ALL DRIP WITH WET
SOMETIMES WITH THE HORRID ADDITIONS OF PAWSING AND GOUGING AND BITING
HE HAD ALSO HIS FULL SHARE OF AMBITION
AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HER COUSINS I SHOULD PROBABLY BE INTRODUCED TO CONNECTIONS FAR MORE IMPROVING POLISHED AND CULTIVATED THAN ANY I HAVE YET KNOWN
PAPA WILL PERHAPS THINK IT A WILD AND AMBITIOUS SCHEME
AUSSITOT QUE J'AURAIS GAGNE ASSEZ D'ARGENT POUR ALTER A BRUXELLES J'Y IRAI AND SO HER JOURNEY BACK TO HAWORTH AFTER THE RARE PLEASURE OF THIS VISIT TO HER FRIEND WAS PLEASANTLY BEGUILED BY CONVERSATION WITH THE FRENCH GENTLEMAN
I HAVE NO DOUBT THEIR ADVICE IS COMPLETELY AT YOUR SERVICE
THE COST OF THE JOURNEY THERE AT THE DEAREST RATE OF TRAVELLING WOULD BE 5_L
WHERE AM I GOING TO RESIDE
MRS B FOR EXAMPLE
INDEED AT THE END OF JANUARY IT WAS ARRANGED THAT THEY WERE TO SET OFF FOR THIS PLACE IN THREE WEEKS UNDER THE ESCORT OF A FRENCH LADY THEN VISITING IN LONDON
I WISH YOU WOULD SPEAK TO ME
SHE WRITES THUS OCTOBER 13TH 1843 MARY IS GETTING ON WELL AS SHE DESERVES TO DO
ANNE'S OF TENDERNESS
FOR BESIDES THE INFLUENCE EXERTED BY HER FATHER'S IDEAS CONCERNING THE SIMPLICITY OF ATTIRE BEFITTING THE WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF A COUNTRY CLERGYMAN HER AUNT ON WHOM THE DUTY OF DRESSING HER NIECES PRINCIPALLY DEVOLVED HAD NEVER BEEN IN SOCIETY SINCE SHE LEFT PENZANCE EIGHT OR NINE YEARS BEFORE AND THE PENZANCE FASHIONS OF THAT DAY WERE STILL DEAR TO HER HEART
AND STILL IF THEY ARE WORTHLESS TIME WILL HENCEFORTH BE TOO PRECIOUS TO BE WASTED ON THEM
SHE WAS NEVER SEEN OUT OF TEMPER FOR A MOMENT
BUT HER SALARY WAS TOO SMALL FOR HER TO SAVE OUT OF IT
BUT THEY ALL THOUGHT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT BRANWELL'S TALENT FOR DRAWING
HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT STUNNING OR DROWNING HIS AGONY OF MIND
AND TO THIS THEIR AUNT WAS AVERSE
I HAVE HEARD HIM ALLUDE IN LATE YEARS TO LORD PALMERSTON AS ONE WHO HAD OFTEN BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIM THEN IN THE MIMIC MILITARY DUTIES WHICH THEY HAD TO PERFORM
I HAVE SAID IT IS MOST PROBABLE THAT WHERE HAWORTH CHURCH NOW STANDS THERE WAS ONCE AN ANCIENT FIELD-KIRK OR ORATORY
BUT IN VAIN
TO HAVE A SCHOOL WAS TO HAVE SOME PORTION OF DAILY LEISURE UNCONTROLLED BUT BY HER OWN SENSE OF DUTY
ONE MAN STILL SURVIVES WHO FOR FIFTY YEARS HAS HAD ONE OF THE FINEST TENOR VOICES I EVER HEARD AND WITH IT A REFINED AND CULTIVATED TASTE
THIS WOMAN ALMOST FRIGHTENED HER
MR BRONTE THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD BEEN UNJUSTLY AND UNFAIRLY TREATED AND HE ASSISTED THEM BY ALL THE MEANS IN HIS POWER TO KEEP THE WOLF FROM THEIR DOORS AND AVOID THE INCUBUS OF DEBT
THEY BROUGHT OUT A MAGAZINE ONCE A MONTH AND WISHED IT TO LOOK AS LIKE PRINT AS POSSIBLE
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN HER MOTHER'S COMPANION AND HELPMATE IN MANY A HOUSEHOLD AND NURSERY EXPERIENCE FOR MR BRONTE WAS OF COURSE MUCH ENGAGED IN HIS STUDY
WHEN THE BRONTES TOOK POSSESSION THEY MADE THE LARGER PARLOUR TO THE LEFT OF THE ENTRANCE THE FAMILY SITTING-ROOM WHILE THAT ON THE RIGHT WAS APPROPRIATED TO MR BRONTE AS A STUDY
THEY WERE ALL OF THEM RASCALS THEN SHE WOULD LAUNCH OUT INTO PRAISES OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON REFERRING TO HIS ACTIONS
FROM SIX TO EIGHT MISS BRANWELL READ ALOUD TO MR BRONTE
YOUR MOTHER IS BOTH OLD AND INFIRM
ALWAYS IN TERMS OF ADMIRATION OF MR CARUS WILSON HIS PARENTAL LOVE TO HIS PUPILS AND THEIR LOVE FOR HIM
SANS CELA SAVEZ-VOUS CE QUE JE FERAIS MONSIEUR
THE MASTER-ARCHER LIVED THERE CONSTANTLY IN ORDER TO BE EVER AT HAND TO RENDER HIS SERVICES TO THE GUILD
I AM GLAD YOU LIKE BROOMSGROVE THOUGH I DARE SAY THERE ARE FEW PLACES YOU WOULD NOT LIKE WITH MRS M
I DON'T PRIDE MYSELF ON THESE PECULIARITIES
PERVADED BY THE DEEP PIETY TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED AS A FAMILY CHARACTERISTIC
HERE OUR CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE TO US DISMAL SOUND OF THE CLOCK STRIKING SEVEN AND WE WERE SUMMONED OFF TO BED
ARRANGE ALL THESE THINGS ACCORDING TO YOUR CONVENIENCE
CHARLOTTE BRONTE DE TEMPS EN TEMPS IL PARAIT SUR LA TERRE DES HOMMES DESTINES A ETRE LES INSTRUMENTS PREDESTINES POURQUOI CETTE SUPPRESSION DE GRANDS CHANGEMENTS MORAUX OU POLITIQUES
THE PREVIOUS INCUMBENT HAD BEEN THE MR CHARNOCK WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED AS NEXT BUT ONE IN SUCCESSION TO MR GRIMSHAW
HE AND HIS WIFE LIVED TO SEE ALL THEIR CHILDREN GROWN UP AND DIED WITHIN A YEAR OF EACH OTHER--HE IN 1808 SHE IN 1809 WHEN THEIR DAUGHTER MARIA WAS TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE
IS NOT THIS CHILDISH
AND AS HE WENT AWAY I HEARD PAPA SAY TO HIM WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU
THE STONES OF THE HALL FORMED PART OF THE MORE ANCIENT VICARAGE WHICH AN ANCESTOR OF CAPTAIN BATT'S HAD SEIZED IN THE TROUBLOUS TIMES FOR PROPERTY WHICH SUCCEEDED THE REFORMATION
I COULD NOT BUY MORE AT A TIME FOR WANT OF CAPITAL
I HATED TO TALK WITH HIM--HATED TO LOOK AT HIM
THOSE WHO HAVE WITNESSED A HAWORTH WEDDING WHEN THE PARTIES WERE ABOVE THE RANK OF LABOURERS WILL NOT EASILY FORGET THE SCENE
THE LIVING OF HARTSHEAD IS RATED IN THE CLERGY LIST AT 202_L
THAT SHE WOULD NEVER RECOVER IT
HE WAS NOW NEARLY EIGHTEEN
BELONGING TO DECAYED FAMILIES FROM WHOSE ANCESTRAL LANDS FIELD AFTER FIELD HAS BEEN SHORN AWAY BY THE URGENCY OF RICH MANUFACTURERS PRESSING HARD UPON NECESSITY
THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON AND THE LITTLE KING'S AND QUEEN'S VISIT TO THE HORSE-GUARDS
ACTED AS HIS SUPPORTERS ONE ON EACH SIDE
SUCH IS THE ANSWER I RECEIVE FROM ALMOST EVERY ONE
BUT THESE BLEMISHES IN HIS CHARACTER WERE ONLY ADDITIONAL REASONS WHY HE YEARNED AFTER A LONDON LIFE IN WHICH HE IMAGINED HE COULD OBTAIN EVERY STIMULANT TO HIS ALREADY VIGOROUS INTELLECT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE WOULD HAVE A LICENSE OF ACTION TO BE FOUND ONLY IN CROWDED CITIES
I CANNOT TELL ON WHAT SUBJECT YOUR HEART AND MIND HAVE BEEN EXCITED
PASSING ON FROM OAKWELL THERE LIE HOUSES RIGHT AND LEFT WHICH WERE WELL KNOWN TO MISS BRONTE WHEN SHE LIVED AT ROE HEAD AS THE HOSPITABLE HOMES OF SOME OF HER SCHOOL-FELLOWS
THESE ARE ALL THE DETAILS I EVER HEARD FROM HER
I MUST INDEED DROP MY SUBSCRIPTION TO THE JEWS BECAUSE I HAVE NO MONEY TO KEEP IT UP
AND HE ACCORDINGLY TOOK MARIA AND ELIZABETH THITHER IN JULY 1824
I HAD INDEED SOME VERY KIND ACQUAINTANCES IN THE FAMILY OF A DR BUT THEY TOO ARE GONE NOW
IT MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE 1833 BUT HOW MUCH EARLIER THERE ARE NO MEANS OF DETERMINING
THE HORSE-RACES WERE JUSTLY OBJECTIONABLE TO MR GRIMSHAW
OF COURSE I KNOW NO OTHER FRIEND IN THE WORLD TO WHOM I COULD APPLY ON THIS SUBJECT EXCEPT YOURSELF
ABOUT FORTY OF THE GIRLS SUFFERED FROM THIS BUT NONE OF THEM DIED AT COWAN BRIDGE
ARE YOU WELL
SHE DIED ON THE 6TH OF MAY 1825 IN THE 12TH YEAR OF HER AGE
THEY KNEW NO OTHER CHILDREN
HE DRANK MOREOVER WHENEVER HE COULD GET THE OPPORTUNITY
WITHOUT THIS INDULGENCE IT WAS LOWER
QUI AIMA SA PATRIE MIEUX QUE SA RENOMMEE
TELL ME WHETHER PAPA REALLY WANTS ME VERY MUCH TO COME HOME AND WHETHER YOU DO LIKEWISE
HOW COULD THE POINT BE MANAGED
MANY VOLUMES OF POEMS ARE NOW PUBLISHED EVERY YEAR WITHOUT ATTRACTING PUBLIC ATTENTION ANY ONE OF WHICH IF IT HAD APPEARED HALF A CENTURY AGO WOULD HAVE OBTAINED A HIGH REPUTATION FOR ITS AUTHOR
MISS BRONTE THUS DESCRIBES THE STATE OF THINGS AT THIS TIME LITTLE HAWORTH HAS BEEN ALL IN A BUSTLE ABOUT CHURCH-RATES SINCE YOU WERE HERE
IT IS HONOUR ENOUGH FOR ME THAT I HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM AND RECEIVED AN ANSWER
SHE APPEARS CALM AND SERIOUS NOW
AT LAST CONSENT WAS GIVEN
WHEN WELL DIRECTED THE INDOMITABLE AND INDEPENDENT ENERGIES OF THE NATIVES OF THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY ARE INVALUABLE
BUT AS THE INEVITABLE MOMENT OF SEPARATION FROM PEOPLE AND PLACES AMONG WHICH SHE HAD SPENT SO MANY HAPPY HOURS DREW NEAR HER SPIRITS GAVE WAY
THE WEATHER TOO FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AFTER CHARLOTTE'S RETURN HAD BEEN PIERCINGLY COLD
SHE HAD A LARGER RELIGIOUS TOLERATION THAN A PERSON WOULD HAVE WHO HAD NEVER QUESTIONED AND THE MANNER OF RECOMMENDING RELIGION WAS ALWAYS THAT OF OFFERING COMFORT NOT FIERCELY ENFORCING A DUTY
MAKE SUCH USE OF THEM AS YOUR JUDGMENT SHALL DICTATE
I NOW BEGIN TO FIND SHE DOES NOT INTEND TO KNOW ME
MY HEART BEAT THICK MY HEAD GREW HOT
SHE HAD HOWEVER EVIDENTLY LEFT IT TO BE IMPLIED THAT SHE WAS NOT ACTING ON HER OWN BEHALF BUT AS AGENT FOR THE REAL AUTHORS SINCE IN A NOTE DATED APRIL 6TH SHE MAKES A PROPOSAL ON BEHALF OF C E AND A
BRONTE INCUMBENT
NEARLY EVERY DWELLING SEEMS DEVOTED TO SOME BRANCH OF COMMERCE
BUT JESSY LAY COLD COFFINED SOLITARY--ONLY THE SOD SCREENING HER FROM THE STORM THIS WAS THE FIRST DEATH THAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE SMALL CIRCLE OF CHARLOTTE'S IMMEDIATE AND INTIMATE FRIENDS SINCE THE LOSS OF HER TWO SISTERS LONG AGO
SHE REPLIED THAT THE DOCTOR HAD RECOMMENDED IT AND THAT WHEN MR W
HE DISCOVERED THAT HIS SERVANT BETTY HAD A FOLLOWER AND WATCHING HIS TIME TILL RICHARD WAS FOUND IN THE KITCHEN HE ORDERED HIM INTO THE DINING-ROOM WHERE THE PUPILS WERE ALL ASSEMBLED
MES PETITES SOEURS COURAIENT HORS DE LA MAISON POUR ME RENCONTRER AUSSITOT QUE LA VOITURE SE FIT VOIR ET ELLES M'EMBRASSAIENT AVEC AUTANT D'EMPRESSEMENT ET DE PLAISIR COMME SI J'AVAIS ETE ABSENTE POUR PLUS D'AN
THE HAWORTH GIG WAS NOT ALWAYS TO BE HAD
THE WRITING OF THESE LETTERS IS ELEGANT AND NEAT
BUT MISS SCATCHERD WAS CLOSE AT HAND AND HER ANGER WOULD HAVE TO BE FACED BEFORE MISS TEMPLE'S KIND THOUGHTFULNESS COULD INTERFERE
HE WAS NO LONGER THE FAMILY PRIDE
THEY WERE THEN DISMISSED TO CHOOSE THE SUBJECT OF A SIMILAR KIND OF PORTRAIT
AND SHE COULD NOT ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS UPON IT
I RETURN TO THE FATHER'S LETTER
SHE COULD NOT FORGET THE GLOOM COULD NOT SLEEP AT NIGHT NOR ATTEND IN THE DAY
PEOPLE TALK OF THE DANGER WHICH PROTESTANTS EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO IN GOING TO RESIDE IN CATHOLIC COUNTRIES AND THEREBY RUNNING THE CHANCE OF CHANGING THEIR FAITH
YOU GIVE A CORRECT DESCRIPTION OF THE PATIENT GRISELS OF THOSE DAYS
BUT IF YOU WERE TO PASS A WINTER IN BELGIUM YOU WOULD BE ILL
IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HER DEVOIR IS SUPERIOR TO CHARLOTTE'S IN POWER AND IN IMAGINATION AND FULLY EQUAL TO IT IN LANGUAGE
SHE HAD NOT ENERGY TO DEFEND HERSELF
YET I HAVE NO THOUGHT OF COMING HOME JUST NOW
WHAT YOU SEE DOES NOT EVEN PRETEND TO BE MORE THAN THE DESCRIPTION OF AN IMAGINATIVE CHILD
IT IS SIGNED C
WHATEVER MIGHT BE HIS FAULTS OR EVEN HIS VICES HIS SISTERS YET HELD HIM UP AS THEIR FAMILY HOPE AS THEY TRUSTED THAT HE WOULD SOME DAY BE THEIR FAMILY PRIDE
ON JULY 15TH SHE SAYS I SUPPOSE AS YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN NO OTHER NOTICES HAVE YET APPEARED NOR HAS THE DEMAND FOR THE WORK INCREASED
THE WINDOWS DO NOT OPEN FREELY AND WIDELY
YOU ONLY WARN ME AGAINST THE FOLLY OF NEGLECTING REAL DUTIES FOR THE SAKE OF IMAGINATIVE PLEASURES
WHEN THE ARGUMENT GOT WARM AND ROSE TO ITS HEIGHT AS THEIR MOTHER WAS THEN DEAD I HAD SOMETIMES TO COME IN AS ARBITRATOR AND SETTLE THE DISPUTE ACCORDING TO THE BEST OF MY JUDGMENT
THEY BLINDED THEMSELVES TO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FAILINGS OF WHICH THEY WERE NOW AND THEN TOLD BY PERSUADING THEMSELVES THAT SUCH FAILINGS WERE COMMON TO ALL MEN OF ANY STRENGTH OF CHARACTER
YOU SEEM IN VERY LOW SPIRITS TO-NIGHT OH I DON'T KNOW
AUGUST SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER PASSED AWAY AND NO PUPILS WERE TO BE HEARD OF
THEY PLAYED AT MERRY GAMES IN THE FIELDS ROUND THE HOUSE
AT THE SAME TIME ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE SOME CATHOLICS WHO ARE AS GOOD AS ANY CHRISTIANS CAN BE TO WHOM THE BIBLE IS A SEALED BOOK AND MUCH BETTER THAN MANY PROTESTANTS WHEN THE BRONTES FIRST WENT TO BRUSSELS IT WAS WITH THE INTENTION OF REMAINING THERE FOR SIX MONTHS OR UNTIL THE GRANDES VACANCES BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER
BE AS ANGRY AS YOU PLEASE WITH ME FOR DISAPPOINTING YOU
THE AFFECTIONS ARE STRONG AND THEIR FOUNDATIONS LIE DEEP
YOU SAY WELL IN SPEAKING OF THAT NO SUFFERINGS ARE SO AWFUL AS THOSE BROUGHT ON BY DISSIPATION
YOUR PROPOSAL HAS ALMOST DRIVEN ME CLEAN DAFT'--IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT LADYLIKE EXPRESSION YOU MUST ASK ME WHAT IT MEANS WHEN I SEE YOU
6D
YOU DO A GOOD DEED WHEN YOU SEND ME A LETTER FOR YOU COMFORT A VERY DESOLATE HEART ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE SILENT ESTRANGEMENT BETWEEN MADAME HEGER AND MISS BRONTE IN THE SECOND YEAR OF HER RESIDENCE AT BRUSSELS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE FACT THAT THE ENGLISH PROTESTANT'S DISLIKE OF ROMANISM INCREASED WITH HER KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND ITS EFFECTS UPON THOSE WHO PROFESSED IT
MUCH LOVED WAS SHE MUCH LOVING
PRECURSORS OF MANY SUCH IN AFTER YEARS
HEGER IL N'Y A RIEN QUE JE CRAINS COMME LE DESOEUVREMENT L'INERTIE LA LETHARGIE DES FACULTES
MUCH HAD TO BE TALKED OVER BETWEEN THE FATHER AND AUNT IN HAWORTH PARSONAGE
AS HE WENT OUT HE SPOKE TO THE CONGREGATION AND TOLD THEM NOT TO DISPERSE AS HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO THEM AND WOULD RETURN PRESENTLY
A DISTANT RELATION OF MINE ONE PATRICK BRANWELL HAS SET OFF TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE IN THE WILD WANDERING ADVENTUROUS ROMANTIC KNIGHT-ERRANT-LIKE CAPACITY OF CLERK ON THE LEEDS AND MANCHESTER RAILROAD
THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THIS DAY WERE PECULIARLY TRYING TO DELICATE CHILDREN PARTICULARLY TO THOSE WHO WERE SPIRITLESS AND LONGING FOR HOME AS POOR MARIA BRONTE MUST HAVE BEEN
IF TEACHING ONLY WERE REQUISITE IT WOULD BE SMOOTH AND EASY
BUT I BELIEVE THEY SHRANK FROM ANY ATTEMPT TO DEFINE THEIR FEARS AND SPOKE OF HIM TO EACH OTHER AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
AND THE DIETARY WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ME IN MANUSCRIPT WAS NEITHER BAD NOR UNWHOLESOME
IT FELT VERY STRANGE AT FIRST TO SUBMIT TO AUTHORITY INSTEAD OF EXERCISING IT--TO OBEY ORDERS INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM
TWO OR THREE THINGS STRIKE ME MUCH IN THIS FRAGMENT
OF THE PLACES OF AMUSEMENT
AND THE FORMER QUALITY SUGGESTED TO HIS FANCY STRANGE OUT-OF-THE-WAY KINDS OF PUNISHMENT FOR ANY REFRACTORY PUPILS
BUT THESE ARE QUALIFICATIONS SCARCELY FIT TO BE INSERTED IN A PROSPECTUS
GOD BLESS THE WALLS THEREOF
SHE CONFESSED IT WAS NOT BRILLIANT BUT WHAT COULD SHE DO
PERCY AND WEST INTO THE VERY BEST SOCIETY AND RECORDING ALL THEIR SAYINGS AND DOINGS IN DOUBLE-COLUMNED CLOSE-PRINTED PAGES I RECOLLECT WHEN I WAS A CHILD GETTING HOLD OF SOME ANTIQUATED VOLUMES AND READING THEM BY STEALTH WITH THE MOST EXQUISITE PLEASURE
I TOLD HER SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE FISHING
LET US HAVE NO MORE NONSENSE IF YOU LOVE ME
AND UPON A STONE ABOVE THE DOOR WAS CUT IN LARGE LETTERS SPITE HALL IT WAS ERECTED BY A MAN IN THE VILLAGE OPPOSITE TO THE HOUSE OF HIS ENEMY WHO HAD JUST FINISHED FOR HIMSELF A GOOD HOUSE COMMANDING A BEAUTIFUL VIEW DOWN THE VALLEY WHICH THIS HIDEOUS BUILDING QUITE SHUT OUT FEARLESS--BECAUSE THIS PEOPLE WERE QUITE FAMILIAR TO ALL OF THEM--AMIDST SUCH A POPULATION LIVED AND WALKED THE GENTLE MISS W---'S EIGHT OR NINE PUPILS
HEADACHE SICKLINESS AND FLATNESS OF SPIRITS MADE ME A POOR COMPANION A SAD DRAG ON THE VIVACIOUS AND LOQUACIOUS GAIETY OF ALL THE OTHER INMATES OF THE HOUSE
EMILY IS MAKING RAPID PROGRESS IN FRENCH GERMAN MUSIC AND DRAWING
YET PROBABLY YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE WILL APPROVE AND IF IT DOES STAY WITH HER
TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND SHE WAS PAST THE AGE FOR ANY VERY ACTIVE SERVICE BEING NEARER SEVENTY THAN SIXTY AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT
WE ARRIVED IN THE DARK AND WENT NEXT MORNING TO OUR RESPECTIVE SCHOOLS TO SEE THEM
AT PRESENT THOUGH HE HAD THEY WERE AWARE FALLEN INTO SOME ERRORS THE EXACT NATURE OF WHICH THEY AVOIDED KNOWING STILL HE WAS THEIR HOPE AND THEIR DARLING
4

SHE OWNED THAT AFTER CLOTHING HERSELF AND ANNE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT THOUGH SHE HAD HOPED TO BE ABLE TO SAVE SOMETHING
IT IS SCARCELY KNOWN AND ALL OF IT THAT MERITS TO BE KNOWN ARE THE POEMS OF ELLIS BELL
MY DARLING I COULD NOT AFFORD TO DO IT
WHEN SHE APPEARED IN THE SCHOOLROOM HER DRESS WAS CHANGED BUT JUST AS OLD
THE STORY IS THAT HE TRIED ALL MEANS OF PERSUASION AND EVEN INTIMIDATION TO HAVE THE RACES DISCONTINUED BUT IN VAIN
I FIXED ON EMILY
VOUS ETES ENTREE DANS LE SUJET
IL A LA PAROLE FACILE ET POSSDE A UN HAUT DEGRE L'ELOQUENCE DU BON SENS ET DU COEUR
WHAT I WISH FOR NOW IS ACTIVE EXERTION--A STAKE IN LIFE
SOME ONE SPEAKING OF HER TO ME IN A CARELESS KIND OF STRENGTH OF EXPRESSION SAID SHE NEVER SHOWED REGARD TO ANY HUMAN CREATURE
BRONTE ESQ
CHAPTER VII MISS BRONTE LEFT ROE HEAD IN 1832 HAVING WON THE AFFECTIONATE REGARD BOTH OF HER TEACHER AND HER SCHOOL-FELLOWS AND HAVING FORMED THERE THE TWO FAST FRIENDSHIPS WHICH LASTED HER WHOLE LIFE LONG
TAKE CARE OF OVER EXCITEMENT AND ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP A QUIET MIND EVEN FOR YOUR HEALTH IT IS THE BEST ADVICE THAT CAN BE GIVEN YOU
AND WHAT CROPS THERE ARE ON THE PATCHES OF ARABLE LAND CONSIST OF PALE HUNGRY-LOOKING GREY GREEN OATS
BUT HE WAS APPARENTLY UNACQUAINTED WITH THE PRIME ELEMENT IN GOOD ADMINISTRATION--SEEKING OUT THOROUGHLY COMPETENT PERSONS TO FILL EACH DEPARTMENT AND THEN MAKING THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR AND JUDGING THEM BY THE RESULT WITHOUT PERPETUAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE DETAILS
SHE SMILED BETWEEN GLADDENING WHATEVER SAW HER
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS A CHILD IN THE HOUSE THEY WERE SUCH STILL NOISELESS GOOD LITTLE CREATURES
CHARLOTTE USED TO LIKE THE COUNTRY ROUND BRUSSELS
AND HE DEVISED A SCHEME BY WHICH A CERTAIN SUM WAS RAISED ANNUALLY BY SUBSCRIPTION TO COMPLETE THE AMOUNT REQUIRED TO FURNISH A SOLID AND SUFFICIENT ENGLISH EDUCATION FOR WHICH THE PARENT'S PAYMENT OF 14_L
SOMETHING INTERNAL SEEMED TO EXPAND BODILY FOR A MINUTE
AND TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR AND A HALF THAT SHE REMAINED AS A PUPIL AT ROE HEAD SHE RECEIVED HER FIRST BAD MARK FOR AN IMPERFECT LESSON
OR IT MIGHT BE THE CARRIER HAD UNSUSPICIOUSLY BROUGHT HIM SOME IN A PACKET FROM A DISTANCE
AMEN
TWO OR THREE CAME FROM HUDDERSFIELD
EMILY IS SORRY CHAPTER XIII THE MOORS WERE A GREAT RESOURCE THIS SPRING
THE DOCTOR HALF-HESITATINGLY REVEALED TO HIM HIS HOPELESS STATE
EH BIEN
I DID NOT THINK IT HAD BEEN IN THEIR PHLEGMATIC NATURE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU FEEL AS I DO BUT THERE ARE TIMES NOW WHEN IT APPEARS TO ME AS IF ALL MY IDEAS AND FEELINGS EXCEPT A FEW FRIENDSHIPS AND AFFECTIONS ARE CHANGED FROM WHAT THEY USED TO BE
SOUTHEY'S LIFE OF HIS FATHER VOL
WHILE I WRITE THIS I AM IN THE KITCHEN OF THE PARSONAGE HAWORTH
HEGER REMARKS WHEN YOU ARE WRITING PLACE YOUR ARGUMENT FIRST IN COOL PROSAIC LANGUAGE
HIS SERMON LASTED AN HOUR YET I WAS SORRY WHEN IT WAS DONE
I SAID TO MYSELF I HAVE NEVER YET QUITTED A PLACE WITHOUT GAINING A FRIEND
BUT FOR THIS WE HAD BEEN PREPARED AT THE OUTSET
NOR DO THEY SHOW THEMSELVES ON THE SURFACE
THE NEXT MORNING SHE SAILED
WHAT YOU ARE I CAN ONLY INFER FROM YOUR LETTER WHICH APPEARS TO BE WRITTEN IN SINCERITY THOUGH I MAY SUSPECT THAT YOU HAVE USED A FICTITIOUS SIGNATURE
1845 SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD QUITE DECIDED TO STAY AT HOME
CHARLOTTE'S LIFE AT MISS W---'S WAS A VERY HAPPY ONE UNTIL HER HEALTH FAILED
THE QUALITY STRIKES ME AS OF SINGULAR MERIT FOR A GIRL OF THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN
AND WHEN ALL THE WOOL-SPINNING WAS DONE BY HAND IN THE FARM-HOUSES ROUND
WAS LAST THERE HE HAD BROUGHT THEM A BOTTLE OF WINE AND JAR OF PRESERVES
WRITE TO ME OFTEN MY DEAR NELL
AND FREQUENTLY THEY WERE OBLIGED TO MEET IN THE OPEN AIR
AND IN THE EVENINGS OF THIS WINTER OF 1839-40 THE ALTERATIONS THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY IN THE HOUSE AND THE BEST WAY OF CONVINCING THEIR AUNT OF THE WISDOM OF THEIR PROJECT FORMED THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION
MARCH 12 1839
SHE URGES ME VERY MUCH TO LEAVE BRUSSELS AND GO TO HER
I THINK OF FIXING THE BOARD AND ENGLISH EDUCATION AT 25_L
ALL THE DISSENTERS WERE INVITED TO COME AND HEAR AND THEY ACTUALLY SHUT UP THEIR CHAPELS AND CAME IN A BODY
AND ALL HAVE HEAVY LIFELESS PHYSIOGNOMIES
ONE OF THOSE ORDERED WAS RICE BOILED IN WATER AND EATEN WITH A SAUCE OF TREACLE AND SUGAR
THEY SPENT THEIR WEEKLY HOLIDAY WITH THIS FAMILY FOR MANY MONTHS
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN A GOOD SLEEPER BUT NOW SHE COULD NOT SLEEP AT ALL
NOR WERE EXTERNAL EVENTS AMONG THE CIRCLE OF THEIR FRIENDS OF A CHEERFUL CHARACTER
THEY HAD BEFORE THAT RECOGNISED THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SWEET DIGNITY AND BENEVOLENCE OF MISS TEMPLE AS ONLY A JUST TRIBUTE TO THE MERITS OF ONE WHOM ALL THAT KNEW HER APPEAR TO HOLD IN HONOUR
SHE USED TO SPEAK OF HER TWO ELDER SISTERS MARIA AND ELIZABETH WHO DIED AT COWAN BRIDGE
TALK NO MORE ABOUT MY FORSAKING YOU
CHAPTER IV ABOUT A YEAR AFTER MRS BRONTE'S DEATH AN ELDER SISTER AS I HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED CAME FROM PENZANCE TO SUPERINTEND HER BROTHER-IN-LAW'S HOUSEHOLD AND LOOK AFTER HIS CHILDREN
WRITE POETRY FOR ITS OWN SAKE
AND BY THE COURSE OF THE BECK ALDER-TREES AND WILLOWS AND HAZEL BUSHES GROW
IN RETURN SHE CLAIMED TO BE LOOKED UPON AS A HUMBLE FRIEND
HARTSHEAD IS A VERY SMALL VILLAGE LYING TO THE EAST OF HUDDERSFIELD AND HALIFAX
DO NOT THINK IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE UNKIND TO ME THAT I WISH TO LEAVE BELGIUM
TABBY ROSE AND OPENED IT
THIS LADY WAS ASSISTED IN THE WORK OF INSTRUCTION BY HER HUSBAND--A KINDLY WISE GOOD AND RELIGIOUS MAN--WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE I AM GLAD TO HAVE MADE AND WHO HAS FURNISHED ME WITH SOME INTERESTING DETAILS FROM HIS WIFE'S RECOLLECTIONS AND HIS OWN OF THE TWO MISS BRONTES DURING THEIR RESIDENCE IN BRUSSELS
IN HIS YOUTH HE MUST HAVE BEEN UNUSUALLY HANDSOME
SHE OFTEN IN HER BRIEF LIFE SHED TEARS--SHE HAD FREQUENT SORROWS
THAT ACCESS FROM ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER WAS NOT SO DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICABLE AS HER TEARS WOULD SEEM TO PREDICATE
MAIS IF I WERE A DISSENTER I WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF KICKING OR OF HORSE-WHIPPING BOTH THE GENTLEMEN FOR THEIR STERN BITTER ATTACK ON MY RELIGION AND ITS TEACHERS
SUCH WAS THE SAD FOREBODING OF HIS SISTERS
SHE WAS BURIED AT THE OLD CHURCH SCARBOROUGH
JE N'AI PAS ICI A ME FAIRE UNE REPUTATION DE HEROS MAGNANIME MAIS A GUERIR SI LA CURE EST POSSIBLE L'EUROPE QUI SE MEURT EPUISEE DE RESSOURCES ET DE SANG L'EUROPE DONT VOUS NEGLIGEZ LES VRAIS INTERETS PRE-OCCUPES QUE VOUS ETES D'UNE VAINE RENOMMEE DE CLEMENCE
A SOUND FILLED MY EARS WHICH I DEEMED THE RUSTLING OF WINGS
THEY WERE PROTESTANT TO THE BACKBONE IN OTHER THINGS BESIDE THEIR RELIGION BUT PRE-EMINENTLY SO IN THAT
FROM THE BLOODY LANE OVERSHADOWED BY TREES YOU COME INTO THE FIELD IN WHICH OAKWELL HALL IS SITUATED
THEN AS BEFORE THE CHURCH WAS WELL FILLED BUT THE AISLES WERE LEFT CLEAR
MY SALARY IS NOT REALLY MORE THAN 16_L
AND HER CONSCIENCE WAS IN THE HANDS OF HER RELIGIOUS GUIDES
30TH 1846
I AM WELL IN HEALTH
IN FACT TAKING MOST OF THE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS UPON HIMSELF
MADAME HEGER THE HEAD IS A LADY OF PRECISELY THE SAME CAST OF MIND DEGREE OF CULTIVATION AND QUALITY OF INTELLECT AS MISS I THINK THE SEVERE POINTS ARE A LITTLE SOFTENED BECAUSE SHE HAS NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED AND CONSEQUENTLY SOURED
IT WILL NOT APPARENTLY AS FAR AS SHORT-SIGHTED HUMANITY CAN SEE BE FOR YOUR ADVANTAGE TO REMAIN AT NOR WILL YOU BE PRAISED AND ADMIRED FOR REMAINING AT HOME TO COMFORT YOUR MOTHER
HE ALREADY BEGINS TO SPEAK ENGLISH VERY DECENTLY
NO ONE DARED WHEN EMILY'S EYES GLOWED IN THAT MANNER OUT OF THE PALENESS OF HER FACE AND WHEN HER LIPS WERE SO COMPRESSED INTO STONE
THE HANDS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD FELT THEMSELVES AGGRIEVED BY THE MASTERS AND REFUSED TO WORK
AND BESIDES TEACHING ENGLISH I HAVE TIME TO IMPROVE MYSELF IN GERMAN
I COULD ONLY JUDGE OF THE FIDELITY WITH WHICH THE OTHER TWO WERE DEPICTED FROM THE STRIKING RESEMBLANCE WHICH CHARLOTTE UPHOLDING THE GREAT FRAME OF CANVAS AND CONSEQUENTLY STANDING RIGHT BEHIND IT BORE TO HER OWN REPRESENTATION THOUGH IT MUST HAVE BEEN TEN YEARS AND MORE SINCE THE PORTRAITS WERE TAKEN
SHE HAD TO MAKE HER WAY ALONE
WE ARE EXPECTING COMPANY THIS AFTERNOON AND ON TUESDAY NEXT WE SHALL HAVE ALL THE FEMALE TEACHERS OF THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL TO TEA I MAY HERE INTRODUCE A QUOTATION FROM A LETTER WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED FROM MARY SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF THE PREVIOUS EDITIONS OF THIS MEMOIR
THE ADVENTURES OF EDWARD DE CRACK A TALE FEB
THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSEHOLD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN MUCH IMPRESSED WITH THE LITTLE BRONTES EXTRAORDINARY CLEVERNESS
IN THE MEANTIME THE COMPLAINTS I MAKE AT PRESENT ARE A SORT OF RELIEF WHICH I PERMIT MYSELF
YOU WILL ASK ME WHY
SURELY IN THIS DAY WHEN THERE IS NOT A WRITING POET WORTH A SIXPENCE THE FIELD MUST BE OPEN IF A BETTER MAN CAN STEP FORWARD
THERE WERE CAUSES FOR DISTRESS AND ANXIETY IN THE NEWS FROM HOME PARTICULARLY AS REGARDED BRANWELL
SHE WOULD CONFOUND US BY KNOWING THINGS THAT WERE OUT OF OUR RANGE ALTOGETHER
MY OWN DEAR E I MAY RIGHTFULLY AND TRULY CALL YOU SO NOW
JESSY WITH HER LITTLE PIQUANT FACE ENGAGING PRATTLE AND WINNING WAYS IS MADE TO BE A PET
NOT BEFORE THE CONSTANT STRAIN UPON HER SPIRITS AND STRENGTH HAD AGAIN AFFECTED HER HEALTH
SCARCELY A WEDDING TOOK PLACE WITHOUT THE ROUGH AMUSEMENT OF FOOT-RACES WHERE THE HALF-NAKED RUNNERS WERE A SCANDAL TO ALL DECENT STRANGERS
WE USED TO BE FURIOUS POLITICIANS AS ONE COULD HARDLY HELP BEING IN 1832
SOMETIMES SHE ADMITTED THIS BUT COULD FIND NO MEANS OF EARNING MONEY
I MUST LEAVE THAT TO YOU THE MARGINAL COMMENTS I NEED HARDLY SAY ARE M
SHE STATED THAT AFTER REMAINING IN HIS CHAMBER FOR SOME TIME HE WENT TO ENGAGE IN RELIGIOUS EXERCISES IN THE HOUSE OF A PARISHIONER THEN HOME AGAIN TO PRAY
HE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN AWARE OF HER ILLNESS AND THE CONDITION IN WHICH HE FOUND HER WAS A TERRIBLE SHOCK TO HIM
AND YET NEVER GRUDGED A LITTLE EXTRA TROUBLE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SUCH SMALL TREATS AS CAME WITHIN HER POWER
MR ROBERSON WAS A FRIEND OF CHARLOTTE BRONTE'S FATHER
I PRAY FERVENTLY SOMETIMES TO BE MADE SO
AN AMERICAN TALE
LINES WRITTEN ON SEEING THE GARDEN OF A GENIUS
CHARLOTTE WOULD ALWAYS ANSWER WHEN SPOKEN TO TAKING THE LEAD IN REPLYING TO ANY REMARK ADDRESSED TO BOTH
MRS JENKINS TOLD ME THAT SHE USED TO ASK THEM TO SPEND SUNDAYS AND HOLIDAYS WITH HER UNTIL SHE FOUND THAT THEY FELT MORE PAIN THAN PLEASURE FROM SUCH VISITS
BUT THE PURCHASE OF BOOKS WAS A NECESSARY LUXURY TO HIM BUT AS IT WAS OFTEN A CHOICE BETWEEN BINDING AN OLD ONE OR BUYING A NEW ONE THE FAMILIAR VOLUME WHICH HAD BEEN HUNGRILY READ BY ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WAS SOMETIMES IN SUCH A CONDITION THAT THE BEDROOM SHELF WAS CONSIDERED ITS FITTING PLACE
THOUGHT I I HAVE HEARD OF LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT BUT THIS BEATS ALL
WELLINGTON LE BRUSQNE
AND THAT NOT IN THE HEREDITARY MANNER BY AGRICULTURAL PURSUITS BUT BY THE LABOUR OF HIS BRAIN
HOW LONG THAT WILL BE I DO NOT KNOW
LONG BEFORE SHE HAD WRITTEN OF MARY T THAT SHE WAS FULL OF FEELINGS NOBLE WARM GENEROUS DEVOTED AND PROFOUND
THE INITIALS HOWEVER BEING IN OLD ENGLISH
AND LIKE ALL DESCRIPTIONS OF DOING AS DISTINCT FROM THINKING OR FEELING IN LETTERS IT SADDENS ONE IN PROPORTION TO THE VIVACITY OF THE PICTURE OF WHAT WAS ONCE AND IS NOW UTTERLY SWEPT AWAY
SO MUCH SO AS TO BE QUALIFIED TO GIVE INSTRUCTION IN IT TO THE THREE YOUNGER SISTERS OF MY INFORMANT
ALSO THE IDIOTIC MERCENARY ASPECT OF ALL THE PRIESTS
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PUTTING THEM INTO ACTUAL EXECUTION SHE RATHER FALLS OFF
I HAD BEGUN TO GET LOW-SPIRITED AT NOT RECEIVING ANY NEWS AND TO ENTERTAIN INDEFINITE FEARS THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IS DESOLATE AND WILD
TURNING OFF FROM THIS TO THE RIGHT YOU ASCEND THROUGH AN OLD PASTURE-FIELD AND ENTER A SHORT BY-ROAD CALLED THE BLOODY LANE"--A WALK HAUNTED BY THE GHOST OF A CERTAIN CAPTAIN BATT THE REPROBATE PROPRIETOR OF AN OLD HALL CLOSE BY IN THE DAYS OF THE STUARTS
A SONG
THEY ARE NOT EASILY MADE INTO EITHER FRIENDS OR ENEMIES
IN TAKING THE PLACE I HAVE MADE A LARGE SACRIFICE IN THE WAY OF SALARY IN THE HOPE OF SECURING COMFORT,--BY WHICH WORD I DO NOT MEAN TO EXPRESS GOOD EATING AND DRINKING OR WARM FIRE OR A SOFT BED BUT THE SOCIETY OF CHEERFUL FACES AND MINDS AND HEARTS NOT DUG OUT OF A LEAD-MINE OR CUT FROM A MARBLE QUARRY
ONE DAY LATELY I FELT AS IF I COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND I WENT TO MADAME HEGER AND GAVE HER NOTICE
THAT SHE HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE
OR IF IN THIS TIME OF SICKNESS SHE FELL SHORT OF ANY COMFORTS WHICH HER STATE RENDERED NECESSARY THE PARSONAGE COULD SUPPLY THEM
AT LENGTH IN DESPAIR HE PRAYED WITH SUCH FERVOUR OF EARNESTNESS THAT THE RAIN CAME DOWN IN TORRENTS AND DELUGED THE GROUND SO THAT THERE WAS NO FOOTING FOR MAN OR BEAST EVEN IF THE MULTITUDE HAD BEEN WILLING TO STAND SUCH A FLOOD LET DOWN FROM ABOVE
I SUSPECT THAT THIS YEAR OF 1825 WAS THE LAST TIME IT COULD EVER BE APPLIED TO HER
IT IS INDEED MORE THAN A YEAR SINCE I WAS THERE BUT I FREQUENTLY HEAR FROM E AND SHE DID NOT FAIL TO TELL ME THAT YOU WERE GONE INTO WORCESTERSHIRE
ONE DAY IS LIKE ANOTHER IN THIS PLACE
AND IMPRESSED THE AUTHORITY SO FAVOURABLY THAT HE ALLOWED HER TO COME ON BOARD AND TAKE POSSESSION OF A BERTH
MARY IS FAR FROM WELL
THEY HAVE A QUICK PERCEPTION OF CHARACTER AND A KEEN SENSE OF HUMOUR
HAD YOU NO FEELING OF INTENSE AND ARDENT INTEREST WHEN IN ST JAMES'S YOU SAW THE PALACE WHERE SO MANY OF ENGLAND'S KINGS HAVE HELD THEIR COURTS AND BEHELD THE REPRESENTATIONS OF THEIR PERSONS ON THE WALLS
BUT THAT THE AUTHORS DIRECT HER TO ASK MESSRS
SHE OFFERED ME THE USE OF HER FURNITURE
BUT SHE WAS DAINTY AS TO THE FIT OF HER SHOES AND GLOVES
WHAT YOU SAID HAS CHEERED ME A LITTLE
APRIL 15TH 1839
THE FATHER IGNORANT OF MANY FAILINGS IN MORAL CONDUCT DID PROUD HOMAGE TO THE GREAT GIFTS OF HIS SON
THEY MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT I HAVE NOT FOR FROM THEM I RECEIVED A BRIEF AND BUSINESS-LIKE BUT CIVIL AND SENSIBLE REPLY ON WHICH WE ACTED AND AT LAST MADE WAY I INQUIRED FROM MR ROBERT CHAMBERS AND FOUND AS MISS BRONTE CONJECTURED THAT HE HAD ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN THE APPLICATION WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM AND HIS BROTHER FOR ADVICE
I WILL SHOW YOU CANDIDLY HOW THE QUESTION STRIKES ME
SOMETIMES THE SOUR RUDENESS AMOUNTS TO POSITIVE INSULT
THOUGH I AM A POOR WORKING MAN WHICH I HAVE NEVER FELT TO BE ANY DEGRADATION I COULD TALK WITH HER WITH THE GREATEST FREEDOM
ALTHOUGH ROE HEAD AND HAWORTH ARE NOT TWENTY MILES APART THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY IS AS TOTALLY DISSIMILAR AS IF THEY ENJOYED A DIFFERENT CLIMATE
I THOUGHT THE DEGRADATION OF NATURE SHE FEARED WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF POVERTY AND THAT SHE SHOULD GIVE HER ATTENTION TO EARNING MONEY
BUT NO TREMBLING IMPATIENCE SHOULD LEAD HER TO TAKE AN UNWISE STEP IN HASTE
HE WOULD STEAL OUT WHILE THE FAMILY WERE AT CHURCH--TO WHICH HE HAD PROFESSED HIMSELF TOO ILL TO GO--AND MANAGE TO CAJOLE THE VILLAGE DRUGGIST OUT OF A LUMP
HEGER'S
AND THIS CHRISTMAS SHE HAD PROMISED TO DO SO BUT HER COMING HAD TO BE DELAYED ON ACCOUNT OF A LITTLE DOMESTIC ACCIDENT DETAILED IN THE FOLLOWING LETTER DEC
EMILY WORKS LIKE A HORSE AND SHE HAS HAD GREAT DIFFICULTIES TO CONTEND WITH--FAR GREATER THAN I HAVE HAD
CHARLOTTE TRIED HARD IN AFTER YEARS TO RECALL THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER MOTHER AND COULD BRING BACK TWO OR THREE PICTURES OF HER
YET TIME CAREFUL STUDY LONG ACQUAINTANCE OVERCOME MOST DIFFICULTIES
THE LIFE OF OBERLIN AND LEIGH RICHMOND'S DOMESTIC PORTRAITURE ARE THE LAST OF THIS DESCRIPTION
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS WELL-READ BUT NOT WELL-GROUNDED
I CAN SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
PER ANNUM AGAIN AT A LATER DATE JULY 24TH IN THE SAME YEAR SHE WRITES I AM DRIVING ON WITH MY SMALL MATTER AS WELL AS I CAN
LES NATURES PUISSANTES SONT EXTREMES EN TOUT ELLES NE CONNAISSENT LA TIEDEUR NI DANS LE BIEN NI DANS LE MAL
C'EST LE SEUL CONVENABLE
I HAD HOPED TO HAVE HAD THE EXTREME PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU AT HAWORTH THIS SUMMER BUT HUMAN AFFAIRS ARE MUTABLE AND HUMAN RESOLUTIONS MUST BEND TO THE COURSE OF EVENTS
HE SEEMS TO HAVE RATED EMILY'S GENIUS AS SOMETHING EVEN HIGHER THAN CHARLOTTE'S
SO SHE SET TO ADVERTISING AND INQUIRING WITH FRESH VIGOUR
SHE HAD INTENDED TO SEEK OUT THE CHAPTER COFFEE-HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD STAYED BEFORE AND WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN NEAR THE PLACE WHERE THE STEAM-BOATS LAY
IN THE DAYTIME DRIVEN ABROAD BY LOATHING OF HER COMPANION AND BY THE WEAK RESTLESSNESS OF FEVER SHE TRIED TO WALK HERSELF INTO SUCH A STATE OF BODILY FATIGUE AS WOULD INDUCE SLEEP
SUR NAPOLEON AU BERCEAU UNE MERE BRILLAIT
SHE REMAINED THERE AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD FOR THIRTY YEARS
TABBY AND I WERE ALONE IN THE KITCHEN ABOUT HALF-PAST NINE ANTE-MERIDIAN
HER SALARY WAS 16_L
EACH OF THEM HAS A NICHE IN MY AFFECTIONS
AND THE INJURY DONE BY JAMES AND CHARLES TO THE TRADE BY WHICH THEY GAINED THEIR BREAD MADE THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THEM COMMONWEALTH MEN
THEY HAD TRIED THEIR HANDS AT STORY-WRITING IN THEIR MINIATURE MAGAZINE LONG AGO
THE NAMES OVER THE SHOPS OF WHICH THE ONE JUST GIVEN IS A SAMPLE SEEM STRANGE EVEN TO AN INHABITANT OF THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTY AND HAVE A PECULIAR SMACK AND FLAVOUR OF THE PLACE
MISS BRONTE RELATED TO MY HUSBAND A CURIOUS INSTANCE ILLUSTRATIVE OF THIS EAGER DESIRE FOR RICHES
TO THIS LETTER OF INQUIRY THE PUBLISHERS REPLIED SPEEDILY AND THE TENOR OF THEIR ANSWER MAY BE GATHERED FROM CHARLOTTE'S DATED APRIL 11TH
A SLOW AND SLUGGISH STREAM COMPARED TO THE NEIGHBOURING RIVER OF WHARFE
I WISHED FOR ONE AT LEAST OF MY SISTERS TO SHARE THE ADVANTAGE WITH ME
IN MARCH 1835 SHE WRITES
NO ONE IN THIS HOUSE COULD HAVE REST
AND THE NATURE OF THE GROUND IN THE TWO PARISHES IS MUCH THE OF THE SAME WILD AND HILLY DESCRIPTION
FOR HE SAW SOCIETY OF ONE KIND PROBABLY WHAT HE CALLED LIFE AT THE BLACK BULL
TABBY WAS A THOROUGH SPECIMEN OF A YORKSHIRE WOMAN OF HER CLASS IN DIALECT IN APPEARANCE AND IN CHARACTER
AFTER SOME CONSULTATION AND DELIBERATION THE SISTERS HAD DETERMINED TO CORRECT THE PROOFS THEMSELVES UP TO MARCH 28TH THE PUBLISHERS HAD ADDRESSED THEIR CORRESPONDENT AS C
HE BEGAN URGING HIS BEAST ROUND THE AISLES AND THE SCREAMS AND CRIES AND LAUGHTER OF THE CONGREGATION ENTIRELY DROWNED ALL SOUND OF MR REDHEAD'S VOICE AND I BELIEVE HE WAS OBLIGED TO DESIST
I FEAR IT WILL BE LONG BEFORE SHE IS IN WORKING CONDITION AGAIN
BEFORE THIS TIME IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE CURATES WERE OF THE SAME ORDER AS ONE MR NICHOLLS A YORKSHIRE CLERGYMAN IN THE DAYS IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDING THE REFORMATION WHO WAS MUCH ADDICTED TO DRINKING AND COMPANY-KEEPING AND USED TO SAY TO HIS COMPANIONS YOU MUST NOT HEED ME BUT WHEN I AM GOT THREE FEET ABOVE THE EARTH THAT WAS INTO THE PULPIT
MUCH INQUIRY AND CONSIDERATION WILL BE NECESSARY OF COURSE BEFORE ANY PLACE IS DECIDED ON
BUT FORMERLY WHEN THE BUYERS FROM THE WEST RIDING MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS HAD FREQUENT OCCASION TO GO UP INTO THE NORTH TO PURCHASE THE WOOL OF THE WESTMORLAND AND CUMBERLAND FARMERS IT WAS DOUBTLESS MUCH TRAVELLED
I WOULD HAVE INSERTED THIS TESTIMONY IN THE FIRST EDITION HAD I BELIEVED THAT ANY WEIGHT COULD BE ATTACHED TO AN OPINION FORMED ON SUCH SLIGHT AND SUPERFICIAL GROUNDS
IT IS BUT JUST TO STATE THAT THE MAJOR PART OF THE TESTIMONY WITH WHICH I HAVE BEEN FAVOURED FROM OLD PUPILS IS IN HIGH PRAISE OF MR WILSON
NOR COULD I HELP IT FOR WHAT CAME CAME OUT AND THERE WAS THE END OF IT
AND EMILY WHO SUFFERED AND DROOPED MORE THAN HER SISTERS WHEN AWAY FROM HAWORTH WAS THE ONE APPOINTED TO REMAIN
BOTH AS A SPECIMEN OF HER PROSE STYLE AT THIS TIME AND ALSO AS REVEALING SOMETHING OF THE QUIET DOMESTIC LIFE LED BY THESE CHILDREN I TAKE AN EXTRACT FROM THE INTRODUCTION TO TALES OF THE ISLANDERS THE TITLE OF ONE OF THEIR LITTLE MAGAZINES JUNE THE 31ST 1829
MR BRONTE WAS EVER ON KIND AND FRIENDLY TERMS WITH EACH DENOMINATION AS A BODY
LONG AFTERWARDS HE CAME TO PREACH AND IN HIS SERMON TO A LARGE AND ATTENTIVE CONGREGATION HE GOOD-HUMOUREDLY REMINDED THEM OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED
N'EST-CE PAS PARCE QU'IL Y A DANS CERTAINES NATURES UNE ARDOUR UN FOYER D'ACTIVITE INDOMPTABLE QUI NE LEUR PERMET PAS DE RESTER INACTIVES QUI LES FORCE A SE REMUER AFIN D'EXERCER LES FACULTES PUISSANTES QUI MEME EN DORMANT SONT PRETES COMME SAMPSON A BRISER LES NOEUDS QUI LES RETIENNENT
FOR THESE SERVICES WE ARE TO BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE OUR STUDIES IN FRENCH AND GERMAN AND TO HAVE BOARD C WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT
I FIND IT SO HARD TO REPEL THE RUDE FAMILIARITY OF CHILDREN
SHE TOOK ALL OUR PROCEEDINGS WITH PLIABLE INDIFFERENCE AND ALWAYS SEEMED TO NEED A PREVIOUS RESOLUTION TO SAY NO TO ANYTHING
I WAS ALWAYS SHORT OF THAT
SHE WISHED SHE HAD NOT DREAMED FOR IT DID NOT GO ON NICELY THEY WERE CHANGED
HOW DIVINE ARE THESE RECOLLECTIONS TO ME AT THIS MOMENT
ON AUGUST 27 1837 SHE WRITES I AM AGAIN AT DEWSBURY ENGAGED IN THE OLD BUSINESS,--TEACH TEACH TEACH WHEN WILL YOU COME HOME
THE WORD TO ME WAS NAH MAISTER YAH MUN STOP AN HEV SUM TE-AH YAH MUN EAH YAH MUN A BOUNTIFUL TABLE WAS SOON SPREAD
SO IS MARY FOR YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT SHE IS RETURNING IMMEDIATELY TO THE CONTINENT WITH HER BROTHER
THE FIERCE WILD INTRACTABILITY OF ITS NATURE WAS WHAT OFTEN RECOMMENDED IT TO EMILY
SHE SAW BUT ONE SIDE OF MR WILSON'S CHARACTER
THEY ARE AT THEIR IDOLATROUS MESSE AND I AM HERE THAT IS IN THE REFECTOIRE
THOSE WHO DISAPPROVED OF THE CONDUCT OF THE SINGERS AND SIDED WITH THE MINISTER REMAINED SEATED TILL THE HYMN WAS FINISHED
JUNE 8TH 1839
ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE MORE OF A PASSIVE THAN AN ACTIVE CHARACTER
THE DWELLERS AMONG THEM MUST BE PREPARED FOR CERTAIN UNCOMPLIMENTARY THOUGH MOST LIKELY TRUE OBSERVATIONS PITHILY EXPRESSED
INDEED THERE IS LITTLE DISPLAY OF ANY OF THE AMENITIES OF LIFE AMONG THIS WILD ROUGH POPULATION
AGREEZ MONSIEUR C
TO FACILITATE HER SUCCESS IN THIS PLAN SHOULD SHE EVER ENGAGE IN IT M
BUT AS ONE DEAD MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD FOLLOWS ANOTHER FAST TO THE GRAVE THE LINES ARE PRESSED TOGETHER AND THE LETTERS BECOME SMALL AND CRAMPED
HE FEARS THAT HE WILL BE NOTHING IN HIS PARISH
MR BRANWELL THE FATHER ACCORDING TO HIS DESCENDANTS ACCOUNT WAS A MAN OF MUSICAL TALENT
THIS IS SLAVERY
THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE IT SEEMS HAVE THE IDEA THAT THE FUTURE EPOUX OF MADEMOISELLE BRONTE IS ON THE CONTINENT THESE PEOPLE ARE WISER THAN I AM
ALL THE FOOD HE TOOK IN THE DAY ON SUCH OCCASIONS CONSISTING SIMPLY OF A PIECE OF BREAD AND BUTTER OR DRY BREAD AND A RAW ONION
HE SAYS WHEN MERE CHILDREN AS SOON AS THEY COULD READ AND WRITE CHARLOTTE AND HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS USED TO INVENT AND ACT LITTLE PLAYS OF THEIR OWN IN WHICH THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON MY DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE'S HERO WAS SURE TO COME OFF CONQUEROR
AND IN YOUR CASE I THINK THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED WELL IN BRINGING TO LIGHT AND CONSTRUING THAT HIDDEN LANGUAGE WHOSE TURNINGS WINDINGS INCONSISTENCIES AND OBSCURITIES SO FREQUENTLY BAFFLE THE RESEARCHES OF THE HONEST OBSERVER OF HUMAN NATURE I AM TRULY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR MINDFULNESS OF SO OBSCURE A PERSON AS MYSELF AND I HOPE THE PLEASURE IS NOT ALTOGETHER SELFISH
CHAPTER XII TOWARDS THE END OF JANUARY THE TIME CAME FOR CHARLOTTE TO RETURN TO BRUSSELS
I INTEND TO FORCE MYSELF TO TAKE ANOTHER SITUATION WHEN I CAN GET ONE THOUGH I HATE AND ABHOR THE VERY THOUGHTS OF GOVERNESS-SHIP
THE QUAINT AND NARROW SHOP-WINDOWS OF FIFTY YEARS AGO ARE GIVING WAY TO LARGE PANES AND PLATE-GLASS
HE HIMSELF IT IS BUT FAIR TO SAY DOES NOT REMEMBER THIS CIRCUMSTANCE NOR DOES HE SPEAK OF THE FEVER ITSELF AS EITHER ALARMING OR DANGEROUS
SHE HAD STRONG PREJUDICES AND SOON TOOK A DISTASTE TO YORKSHIRE
AND AT THE END OF THIS DORMITORY THERE WAS A SMALL BED-CHAMBER OPENING OUT OF IT APPROPRIATED TO THE USE OF MISS SCATCHERD
SO SHE IS I DOUBT NOT IN GENERAL SOCIETY
THE PRESENT COTTAGE WAS AT THE TIME OF WHICH I WRITE OCCUPIED BY THE TEACHERS ROOMS THE DINNER ROOM AND KITCHENS AND SOME SMALLER BEDROOMS
BUT IF THE IRIS WAS CLOSELY EXAMINED IT APPEARED TO BE COMPOSED OF A GREAT VARIETY OF TINTS
LA GLOIRE DE WELLINGTON EST COMME LES VIEUX CHENES QUI OMBRAGENT LE CHATEAU DE SES PERES SUR LES RIVES DU SHANNON
THEY PUT UP THEIR HORSES AT THE BLACK BULL--THE LITTLE INN CLOSE UPON THE CHURCHYARD FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF ARVILLS AS WELL AS FOR OTHER PURPOSES--AND WENT INTO CHURCH
AND IN ORDER TO AVOID TEMPTATION AND POSSIBLY TO HAVE THE QUIET NECESSARY FOR DIGESTION HE HAD BEGUN BEFORE HIS WIFE'S DEATH TO TAKE HIS DINNER ALONE--A HABIT WHICH HE ALWAYS RETAINED
I CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND HOW THE SCHOOL THERE CAME TO BE SO UNHEALTHY THE AIR ALL ROUND ABOUT WAS SO SWEET AND THYME-SCENTED WHEN I VISITED IT LAST SUMMER
IT IS AT THIS MOMENT LYING BEFORE ME
6
6
6
HE ACTED UP TO HIS PRINCIPLES OF ACTION
YET IT IS SUFFICIENT TO SAY WE HAVE A CHANCE OF GOING FOR HALF A YEAR
NOTHING WILL BE UNINTERESTING
HEGER THERE WAS SO MUCH TRUTH AS WELL AS SO MUCH KINDNESS IN THIS LETTER--IT WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT A SECOND YEAR OF INSTRUCTION WOULD BE FAR MORE VALUABLE THAN THE FIRST THAT THERE WAS NO LONG HESITATION BEFORE IT WAS DECIDED THAT CHARLOTTE SHOULD RETURN TO BRUSSELS
BUT THE LOOM THE ASSOCIATION THE MOUNTAIN AIR HAVE HAD CHARMS ENOW TO SECURE THEIR CONTINUANCE AT HOME
THE COURSE OF LIFE OF WHICH THIS IS THE OUTLINE SHOWS A POWERFUL AND REMARKABLE CHARACTER ORIGINATING AND PURSUING A PURPOSE IN A RESOLUTE AND INDEPENDENT MANNER
CE N'EST PAS CROYEZ LE BIEN MONSIEUR CE N'EST PAS ICI POUR NOUS UNE QUESTION D'INTERET PERSONNEL C'EST UNE QUESTION D'AFFECTION
ONE MORNING AFTER SHE HAD BECOME SO SERIOUSLY UNWELL AS TO HAVE HAD A BLISTER APPLIED TO HER SIDE THE SORE FROM WHICH WAS NOT PERFECTLY HEALED WHEN THE GETTING-UP BELL WAS HEARD POOR MARIA MOANED OUT THAT SHE WAS SO ILL SO VERY ILL SHE WISHED SHE MIGHT STOP IN BED
HE SPOKE FREELY AND UNAFFECTEDLY TO THE PEOPLE HE MET AND THOUGH HE INDULGED HIS CHILDREN AND ALLOWED THEM TO TEASE HIMSELF FAR TOO MUCH HE WOULD NOT SUFFER THEM GROSSLY TO INSULT OTHERS WRITTEN IN PENCIL TO A FRIEND JULY 1839
I AM IN THAT STATE OF HORRID GLOOMY UNCERTAINTY THAT AT THIS MOMENT I WOULD SUBMIT TO BE OLD GREY-HAIRED TO HAVE PASSED ALL MY YOUTHFUL DAYS OF ENJOYMENT AND TO BE SETTLING ON THE VERGE OF THE GRAVE IF I COULD ONLY THEREBY ENSURE THE PROSPECT OF RECONCILIATION TO GOD AND REDEMPTION THROUGH HIS SON'S MERITS
AT OUR HOUSE SHE HAD JUST AS LITTLE CHANCE OF A PATIENT HEARING FOR THOUGH NOT SCHOOL-GIRLISH WE WERE MORE INTOLERANT
WITH A STRONG CONVICTION OF THE NECESSITY AND VALUE OF EDUCATION VERY UNUSUAL IN A GIRL OF FIFTEEN
EVERYBODY IS JOYOUS AND ANIMATED AT THE PROSPECT BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS TO GO HOME
4 JANE EYRE VOL
MY LIFE SINCE I SAW YOU HAS PASSED AS MONOTONOUSLY AND UNBROKEN AS EVER
WRETCH
LOVE UNREPAID AND FAITH BETRAYED DID THESE TORMENT HIS HEART
AND SO MARIA BRANWELL FADES OUT OF SIGHT
I LOVE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PERFORMANCE
HER HONEST PLAN FOR EARNING HER OWN LIVELIHOOD HAD FALLEN AWAY CRUMBLED TO ASHES
IN THE FIRST PLACE I MUST CONSIDER WHETHER I WILL COMMENCE OPERATIONS ON THE DEFENSIVE OR THE OFFENSIVE
AT THAT HOUR MISS BRANWELL GENERALLY WENT TO BED AND HER NIECES DUTIES FOR THE DAY WERE ACCOUNTED DONE
BUT THE CONSEQUENCES WERE THESE
HIS AUNT ESPECIALLY MADE HIM HER GREAT FAVOURITE
SUCH AN URGENT THIRST TO SEE TO KNOW TO LEARN
I HAVE GONE TO HAWORTH AND FOUND AN ORCHESTRA TO MEET ME FILLED WITH LOCAL PERFORMERS VOCAL AND INSTRUMENTAL TO WHOM THE BEST WORKS OF HANDEL HAYDN MOZART MARCELLO C
AND HEALD'S HALL IS THE LARGEST HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE OF WHICH MR ROBERSON WAS THE VICAR
THE HOUSE IS NOT VERY LARGE BUT EXCEEDINGLY COMFORTABLE AND WELL REGULATED
TO NOTE WELL THE MUMMERIES THEREOF
NON C'ETAIT UNE MAIN QUI COMME LA SIENNE NE TREMBLAIT NI DE PASSION NI DE CRAINTE C'ETAIT LA MAIN D'UN HOMME FROID CONVAINCU QUI AVAIT SU DEVINER BUONAPARTE
I GIVE THE NEXT LETTER AS ILLUSTRATING THE IDEAS OF THESE GIRLS AS TO WHAT PERIODICAL REVIEWS OR NOTICES LED PUBLIC OPINION
SUFFERING ACUTELY FROM EVERY STRANGE AND UNACCUSTOMED CONTACT--FAR AWAY FROM THEIR BELOVED HOME AND THE DEAR MOORS BEYOND--THEIR INDOMITABLE WILL WAS THEIR GREAT SUPPORT
IF YOU HAVE ANY BETTER PLAN TO SUGGEST I AM OPEN TO CONVICTION PROVIDED YOUR PLAN IS PRACTICABLE AUGUST 20TH 1840
BUT EMILY AND ANNE WERE SIMPLY COMPANIONS AND PLAYMATES WHILE CHARLOTTE WAS MOTHERLY FRIEND AND GUARDIAN TO BOTH
NEVER HAVE GIVEN WAY BUT WITH LIFE AND YET MOREOVER HER FACULTY OF IMAGINATION WAS SUCH THAT IF SHE HAD WRITTEN A HISTORY HER VIEW OF SCENES AND CHARACTERS WOULD HAVE BEEN SO VIVID AND SO POWERFULLY EXPRESSED AND SUPPORTED BY SUCH A SHOW OF ARGUMENT THAT IT WOULD HAVE DOMINATED OVER THE READER WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS PREVIOUS OPINIONS OR HIS COOLER PERCEPTIONS OF ITS TRUTH
I COULD IMPROVE GREATLY IN ITALIAN AND EVEN GET A DASH OF GERMAN I.E PROVIDING MY HEALTH CONTINUED AS GOOD AS IT IS NOW
I MAKE TO YOU A CURIOUS RETURN IN THE SHAPE OF HALF A DOZEN CARDS OF TERMS
I NEVER EXCHANGED A LETTER WITH YOU ON THE SUBJECT
THE GRAVEYARD LIES ON TWO SIDES OF THE HOUSE AND GARDEN
AND TO THESE OCCUPATIONS EMILY ADDED THAT OF MUSIC IN WHICH SHE WAS SOMEWHAT OF A PROFICIENT
THE WHOLE FAMILY HAD AN AMPLE SHARE OF THAT SENSITIVE PRIDE WHICH LED THEM TO DREAD INCURRING OBLIGATIONS AND TO FEAR OUTSTAYING THEIR WELCOME WHEN ON ANY VISIT
IN THE EARLY SUMMER OF 1812 WHEN SHE WOULD BE TWENTY-NINE SHE CAME TO VISIT HER UNCLE THE REVEREND JOHN FENNEL WHO WAS AT THAT TIME A CLERGYMAN OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND LIVING NEAR LEEDS BUT WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN A METHODIST MINISTER
SHE HAD ONCE HOPED THAT SHE HERSELF MIGHT BECOME AN ARTIST AND SO EARN HER LIVELIHOOD
INDEED I DERIVED QUITE AN IMPULSE OF ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE WARM ASSURANCE THAT IF I HAD BUT APPLIED A LITTLE SOONER THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SENT ME THEIR DAUGHTER
OAT-CAKE CHEESE AND BEER WERE FREELY PRESSED UPON THE VISITOR
THESE DWELLINGS ARE NOT LARGE YET THEY ARE SOLID AND ROOMY ENOUGH FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THOSE WHO LIVE IN THEM AND TO WHOM THE SURROUNDING ESTATES BELONG
THE STING OF DEATH IS SIN AND THE STRENGTH OF SIN IS THE LAW BUT THANKS BE TO GOD WHICH GIVETH US THE VICTORY THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST."--1 COR
FOR ONE MOMENT FOR AN ATOM OF TIME I THOUGHT I MIGHT CALL YOU MY OWN SISTER IN THE SPIRIT
SO IT WAS AT BREAKFAST
AND AT THIS RIPE TIME OF LIFE I AM A SCHOOL-GIRL AND ON THE WHOLE VERY HAPPY IN THAT CAPACITY
SHE RATHER WISHED TO ENCOURAGE THE FORMER IDEA
IT DOES NOT FRET ME
BUT THEY ARE NOT--SUCH AFFECTIONS SELDOM ARE--WIDE-SPREADING
THE GREAT SOLEMN CATHEDRAL OF ST GUDULE THE RELIGIOUS PAINTINGS THE STRIKING FORMS AND CEREMONIES OF THE ROMISH CHURCH--ALL MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON THE GIRLS FRESH FROM THE BARE WALLS AND SIMPLE WORSHIP OF HAWORTH CHURCH
CINDER-PATHS LEAD UP TO THEM
BUT ABOUT THIS NEITHER HE NOR HIS DESCENDANTS HAVE CARED TO INQUIRE
HER JOURNEY THITHER WAS RATHER DISASTROUS
HE WOULD READ TO THEM VARIOUS ACCOUNTS OF THE SAME PERSON OR EVENT AND MAKE THEM NOTICE THE POINTS OF AGREEMENT AND DISAGREEMENT
1 A REVIEWER POINTED OUT THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE AGE TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS ASSIGNED ON THE MURAL TABLET TO ANNE BRONTE AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH IN 1849 AND THE ALLEGED FACT THAT SHE WAS BORN AT THORNTON FROM WHICH PLACE MR BRONTE REMOVED ON FEBRUARY 25TH 1820
ENTRE SON BERCEAU ET SA TOMBE QU'Y A-T-IL
RICHER PEOPLE WOULD ORDER A DINNER FOR THEIR FRIENDS
ON GOING INTO THIS BUILDING I FOUND ONE PART THAT NEAREST TO THE HIGH ROAD CONVERTED INTO A POOR KIND OF PUBLIC-HOUSE THEN TO LET AND HAVING ALL THE SQUALID APPEARANCE OF A DESERTED PLACE WHICH RENDERED IT DIFFICULT TO JUDGE WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN NEATLY KEPT UP THE BROKEN PANES REPLACED IN THE WINDOWS AND THE ROUGH-CAST NOW CRACKED AND DISCOLOURED MADE WHITE AND WHOLE
CELA NE SE PEUT PAS
I PROMISED HER A BETTER DESTINY THAN TO GO BEGGING ANY ONE TO MARRY HER OR TO LOSE HER NATURAL FEELINGS AS A SISTER OF CHARITY
I HAVE NEVER HAD FIVE MINUTES CONVERSATION WITH HER SINCE I CAME EXCEPT WHILE SHE WAS SCOLDING ME
WHEN I WAS OUT OF STOCK I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID OF THEIR COMING
IL A DES MANIERES FRANCHES ET AVENANTES
I RECEIVED YOUR PACKET OF DESPATCHES ON WEDNESDAY
EMILY AND I LEAVE HOME ON THE 27TH OF THIS MONTH
SHE DIED AGED 27 YEARS MAY 28TH 1849 AND WAS BURIED AT THE OLD CHURCH SCARBORO AT THE UPPER PART OF THIS TABLET AMPLE SPACE IS ALLOWED BETWEEN THE LINES OF THE INSCRIPTION
PASSING AMID THE DEEPEST SHADE OF THE WOOD'S SOMBRE HEART LAST NIGHT I SAW A WOUNDED DEER LAID LONELY AND APART
SHE TOLD ME LONG AGO THAT A MISFORTUNE WAS OFTEN PRECEDED BY THE DREAM FREQUENTLY REPEATED WHICH SHE GIVES TO JANE EYRE OF CARRYING A LITTLE WAILING CHILD AND BEING UNABLE TO STILL IT
SHE USED TO KEEP THE GIRLS SEWING CHARITY CLOTHING AND MAINTAINED TO ME THAT IT WAS NOT FOR THE GOOD OF THE RECIPIENTS BUT OF THE SEWERS
BUT THE EFFORT WAS LAUDABLE AND OF ITSELF SHOWS HOW WILLING THEY BOTH WERE TO CARRY ON THE EDUCATION WHICH THEY HAD BEGUN UNDER MISS W I WILL GIVE AN EXTRACT WHICH WHATEVER MAY BE THOUGHT OF THE LANGUAGE IS GRAPHIC ENOUGH AND PRESENTS US WITH A HAPPY LITTLE FAMILY PICTURE
TABBY MOVES ABOUT IN HER QUAINT COUNTRY DRESS FRUGAL PEREMPTORY PRONE TO FIND FAULT PRETTY SHARPLY YET ALLOWING NO ONE ELSE TO BLAME HER CHILDREN WE MAY FEEL SURE
ENOUGH TO READ IT FLUENTLY BUT HARDLY ENOUGH TO TEACH IT IN COMPETITION WITH NATIVES OR PROFESSIONAL MASTERS
C'EST LA NOTRE ESPOIR EN VOUS ECRIVANT ET CE SERA POUR MESDEMOISELLES CHARLOTTE ET EMILY UNE DOUCE ET BELLE RECOMPENSE DE LEURS TRAVAUX
I PRAY YOU DO NOT FLATTER THEM
SO THE LITTLE THINGS CLUNG QUIETLY TOGETHER FOR THEIR FATHER WAS BUSY IN HIS STUDY AND IN HIS PARISH OR WITH THEIR MOTHER AND THEY TOOK THEIR MEALS ALONE
STILL I FANCY THE GROUND IN THE EAST RIDING IS LESS FULLY OCCUPIED THAN IN THE WEST
WHEN THE HALF-YEAR IS EXPIRED I WILL DO WHAT I CAN
I DESIRE EXCEEDINGLY TO SEE BOTH HER AND YOU
THEN HE GAVE OUT THE CHAPTER AGAIN READ IT AND PREACHED
I AM MUCH HAPPIER BLACK-LEADING THE STOVES MAKING THE BEDS AND SWEEPING THE FLOORS AT HOME THAN I SHOULD BE LIVING LIKE A FINE LADY ANYWHERE ELSE
NOW WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE FORCE OF THE WORDS OUR POOR LITTLE CAT IS DEAD
THEY KNEW THEY HAD LOST SOMETHING WHOSE ABSENCE COULD NEVER BE QUITE ATONED FOR SO LONG AS THEY LIVED
THERE WAS NO OPPOSITION ON THE PART OF ANY OF HER FRIENDS TO HER ENGAGEMENT
HE HAD BUILT A CHAPEL FOR THE WESLEYAN METHODISTS AND NOT VERY LONG AFTER THE BAPTISTS ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN A PLACE OF WORSHIP
IN THINKING OF ALL POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE PLACES WHERE WE COULD ESTABLISH A SCHOOL I HAVE THOUGHT OF BURLINGTON OR RATHER OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF BURLINGTON
SHE WAS AWARE THAT IT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL AND COULD REASON ABOUT IT
I TRY TO CHEER HIM
ET ALORS AVEC UNE IMPASSIBILITE DE SENATEUR ROMAIN LE MODERNE CORIOLAN TOISAIT DU REGARD L'EMEUTE FURIEUSE
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE SEA BY THIS TIME E
AND SHE ARRIVED AT HOME REFRESHED AND HAPPY
AND HOWEVER ILL WHAT HAS HERE BEEN SAID MAY ACCORD WITH YOUR PRESENT VIEWS AND TEMPER THE LONGER YOU LIVE THE MORE REASONABLE IT WILL APPEAR TO YOU
WHAT WAS FORMAL AND SET IN HER WAY OF WRITING TO E DIMINISHED AS THEIR PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE INCREASED AND AS EACH CAME TO KNOW THE HOME OF THE OTHER
A SISTER OF HERS HAD TAKEN THE ACTIVE MANAGEMENT SINCE THE TIME WHEN CHARLOTTE WAS A TEACHER
AND WHEN HE MUST DISTURB HER BY RISING HE PUTS HER SOFTLY DOWN AND NEVER FLINGS HER FROM HIM ROUGHLY
AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS DINNER WAS MORE LOATHED THAN ANY IN THE EARLY DAYS OF COWAN BRIDGE SCHOOL
A LONG DRAWER BENEATH EACH SERVED FOR A WARDROBE AND BETWEEN EACH WAS A STAND FOR EWER BASIN AND LOOKING-GLASS
NOT MORE WRITING THAN COULD BE AVOIDED AND EMPLOYED HERSELF PRINCIPALLY IN KNITTING
IL N'EST POINT AUTEUR
IS HE COMING INQUIRED MY HUSBAND
GRAVE ENTHUSIASTS IN POLITICS OR RELIGION PERCEIVE NOT THE LUDICROUS SIDE OF THOSE WHICH THEY GIVE TO THEIR CHILDREN
BUT NOT ONE OPINION THAT HE HELD COULD BE STIRRED OR MODIFIED BY ANY WORLDLY MOTIVE
IN PASSING HASTILY THROUGH THE TOWN ONE HARDLY PERCEIVES WHERE THE NECESSARY LAWYER AND DOCTOR CAN LIVE SO LITTLE APPEARANCE IS THERE OF ANY DWELLINGS OF THE PROFESSIONAL MIDDLE CLASS SUCH AS ABOUND IN OUR OLD CATHEDRAL TOWNS
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE THROWN THE REINS ON THE NECK OF YOUR IMAGINATION DO NOT PULL HER UP TO REASON AGAIN IN THE VISION OF MOSES HE SEES THE MAIDENS LEADING FORTH THEIR FLOCKS TO THE WELLS AT EVENTIDE AND THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS WEARING FLOWERY GARLANDS
THEY WERE STEADY TEACHERS AT THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL A HABIT WHICH CHARLOTTE KEPT UP VERY FAITHFULLY EVEN AFTER SHE WAS LEFT ALONE
THOUGHT THE UNDERTAKING A MOST PRAISEWORTHY ONE BUT FEARED I SHOULD HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN MAKING IT SUCCEED ON ACCOUNT OF THE SITUATION
EVERY FIBRE OF HER HEART QUIVERED IN THE STRAIN TO MASTER HER WILL
WITH HIS WATCH IT WAS TAKEN OFF AT NIGHT
YOU HAVE RETURNED OR ARE RETURNING FROM LONDON--FROM THE GREAT CITY WHICH IS TO ME AS APOCRYPHAL AS BABYLON OR NINEVEH OR ANCIENT ROME
TO TELL HER SO
S ILLNESS COMES WITH
BUT ALL RESPECTED HER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAT PART WHICH DESCRIBES CHARLOTTE'S MANNER AS ENGLISH TEACHER--AN OFFICE WHICH SHE DID NOT ASSUME FOR SOME MONTHS LATER--ALL THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE SCHOOL LIFE OF THE TWO BRONTES REFERS TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE NEW SCHOLASTIC YEAR IN OCTOBER 1842
OF COURSE ARTISTS AND AUTHORS STOOD HIGH WITH CHARLOTTE AND THE BEST THING AFTER THEIR WORKS WOULD HAVE BEEN THEIR COMPANY
MAY 15TH 1840
SHE IS VERY COMFORTABLE AND WANTS NOTHING
THE TERMS FOR CLOTHING LODGING BOARDING AND EDUCATING ARE 14_L
ON RARE OCCASIONS M
THERE USED TO BE A YEARLY FESTIVAL HALF-RELIGIOUS HALF SOCIAL HELD AT HECKMONDWIKE CALLED THE LECTURE I FANCY IT HAD COME DOWN FROM THE TIMES OF THE NONCONFORMISTS
CHARLOTTE'S OWN WORDS WITH REGARD TO EMILY ARE AFTER THE AGE OF TWENTY HAVING MEANTIME STUDIED ALONE WITH DILIGENCE AND PERSEVERANCE SHE WENT WITH ME TO AN ESTABLISHMENT ON THE CONTINENT
19TH 1848 AGED 30 YEARS
JE VIENS VOUS AIDER
AND THIS QUAINT OLD INN IS FREQUENTED BY FUSTIAN-DRESSED MILL-HANDS FROM THE NEIGHBOURING WORSTED FACTORIES WHICH STREW THE HIGH ROAD FROM LEEDS TO HUDDERSFIELD AND FORM THE CENTRES ROUND WHICH FUTURE VILLAGES GATHER
THIS ARRANGEMENT WILL NOT ALLOW MUCH TIME BUT IT IS THE ONLY PRACTICABLE ONE WHICH CONSIDERING ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES I CAN EFFECT
BOOKS WERE INDEED A VERY COMMON SIGHT IN THAT KITCHEN
I WISH ALL THAT TO BE DONE BEFORE WINTER
I ALMOST WONDER YOU TOOK THE TROUBLE TO READ AND NOTICE THE NOVELETTE OF AN ANONYMOUS SCRIBE WHO HAD NOT EVEN THE MANNERS TO TELL YOU WHETHER HE WAS A MAN OR A WOMAN OR WHETHER HIS C
AND I HUMBLY HOPE HE WILL FOR YOU WILL STRENGTHEN MY POLLUTED PETITIONS WITH YOUR OWN PURE REQUESTS
JE NE CONNAITRAIS PAS CETTE LETHARGIE SI JE POUVAIS ECRIRE
AND THESE THINGS SANK DEEP INTO THE MIND OF ONE AT LEAST AMONG HER HEARERS
SERIOUSLY SIR I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR KIND AND CANDID LETTER
SO PATRICK OR AS HIS FAMILY CALLED HIM--BRANWELL REMAINED AT HAWORTH WORKING HARD FOR SOME HOURS A DAY WITH HIS FATHER
ALL I CAN SAY THEREFORE IS BOTH MR AND MRS
HIS BROTHER HAD BEEN A DETENU IN FRANCE AND HAD AFTERWARDS VOLUNTARILY TAKEN UP HIS RESIDENCE THERE
THEY ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY GUARDED FROM TEMPTATION
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
ON JUNE 17TH CHARLOTTE WRITES BRANWELL DECLARES THAT HE NEITHER CAN NOR WILL DO ANYTHING FOR HIMSELF
BUT THE RECOLLECTIONS OF FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OLD ARE OF A VERY FRAGMENTARY CHARACTER
MR BRONTE WAS THE INCUMBENT OF HARTSHEAD
I AM SURE YOU WILL HAVE THOUGHT ME VERY REMISS IN NOT SENDING MY PROMISED LETTER LONG BEFORE NOW
THEY WERE THERE DURING THE WHOLE TIME NEVER EVEN HAVING THE BREAK TO THEIR MONOTONOUS LIFE WHICH PASSING AN OCCASIONAL DAY WITH A FRIEND WOULD HAVE AFFORDED THEM
AND THEY KNEW THAT HEAVY FALLING RAIN WAS SOAKING INTO THE WET EARTH WHICH COVERED THEIR LOST DARLING
NO OTHER EVENT MAY HAVE HAPPENED OR BE LIKELY TO HAPPEN FOR DAYS TO PUSH ONE OF THESE ASIDE BEFORE IT HAS ASSUMED A VAGUE AND MYSTERIOUS IMPORTANCE
POLITICS WERE EVIDENTLY THEIR GRAND INTEREST
THEY SAILED FROM ANTWERP
EMILY WAS LIKE HER IN THESE HABITS OF MIND BUT CERTAINLY NEVER TOOK HER OPINION BUT ALWAYS HAD ONE TO OFFER I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHARLOTTE THOUGHT OF BRUSSELS
THERE ARE NEITHER BRASSES NOR ALTAR-TOMBS NOR MONUMENTS BUT THERE IS A MURAL TABLET ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE COMMUNION-TABLE BEARING THE FOLLOWING INSCRIPTION HERE LIE THE REMAINS OF MARIA BRONTE WIFE OF THE REV
THERE IS PROBABLY SOME MISTAKE IN THE INSCRIPTION ON THE TABLET
A COMPLAINT TO THE MOTHER ONLY BRINGS BLACK LOOKS ON MYSELF AND UNJUST PARTIAL EXCUSES TO SCREEN THE CHILDREN
IT WAS BROUGHT ME BY MARY AND MARTHA WHO HAVE BEEN STAYING AT HAWORTH FOR A FEW DAYS
I WILL HOLD MY TONGUE
AND FROM THE LENGTH OF HER FAITHFUL SERVICE AND THE ATTACHMENT AND RESPECT WHICH SHE INSPIRED IS DESERVING OF MENTION
NICHOLLS B.A
STONE DYKES ARE EVERYWHERE USED IN PLACE OF HEDGES
I KNOW THAT IF WOMEN WISH TO ESCAPE THE STIGMA OF HUSBAND-SEEKING THEY MUST ACT AND LOOK LIKE MARBLE OR CLAY--COLD EXPRESSIONLESS BLOODLESS
AND IN CONSEQUENCE IT WAS DECIDED THAT IF THE TERMS SUITED MISS BRONTE AND EMILY SHOULD PROCEED THITHER
THIS ORIGINAL HOUSE WAS AN OLD DWELLING OF THE PICARD FAMILY WHICH THEY HAD INHABITED FOR TWO GENERATIONS
RECEVOIR LES LECONS DU MEILLEUR PROFESSEUR QUE NOUS AYONS EN BELGIQUE ET DEJA ELLE AVAIT ELLE-MEME DE PETITES ELEVES
WHEREAS I DOUBT WHETHER SUFFERING PURELY MENTAL HAS ANY GOOD RESULT UNLESS IT BE TO MAKE US BY COMPARISON LESS SENSITIVE TO PHYSICAL SUFFERING TEN YEARS AGO I SHOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT YOUR ACCOUNT OF THE BLUNDER YOU MADE IN MISTAKING THE BACHELOR DOCTOR FOR A MARRIED MAN
THE EFFORT MUST BE BENEFICIAL WHATEVER THE RESULT MAY BE BECAUSE IT TEACHES US EXPERIENCE AND AN ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THIS WORLD
IN THE SAME TOWN WHEN THE POPULATION WAS ABOUT 2,000 PERSONS THERE WAS ONLY ONE CARPET THE FLOORS OF ROOMS WERE SPRINKLED WITH SEA-SAND AND THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE SILVER FORK
THUS SHE WROTE DURING THOSE MIDSUMMER HOLIDAYS
AT COWAN BRIDGE SCHOOL IT WAS TOO OFTEN SENT UP NOT MERELY BURNT BUT WITH OFFENSIVE FRAGMENTS OF OTHER SUBSTANCES DISCOVERABLE IN IT
I HOPE I AM THANKFUL
OUR FELLOWS FROM AESOP'S FABLES AND THE ISLANDERS FROM SEVERAL EVENTS WHICH HAPPENED
MR BRONTE IS TRULY GENEROUS AND REGARDFUL OF ALL DESERVING CLAIMS
IT LAY ON HIS DRESSING-TABLE WITH HIS WATCH
OF THE OVERT ACTS IN WHICH THE BURNING OF CARTWRIGHT'S MILL TOOK A PROMINENT PLACE
THEY ONLY MADE TOO MUCH OF ME WAS HER REMARK AFTER LEAVING THIS FAMILY
I REMEMBER LOOKING ON THOSE TWO SAD EARNEST SHADOWED FACES AND WONDERING WHETHER I COULD TRACE THE MYSTERIOUS EXPRESSION WHICH IS SAID TO FORETELL AN EARLY DEATH
THEY KNEW NO OTHER MODES OF THOUGHT THAN WHAT WERE SUGGESTED TO THEM BY THE FRAGMENTS OF CLERICAL CONVERSATION WHICH THEY OVERHEARD IN THE PARLOUR OR THE SUBJECTS OF VILLAGE AND LOCAL INTEREST WHICH THEY HEARD DISCUSSED IN THE KITCHEN
THEY MADE SOME TRIVIAL REMARK ABOUT CLEVERALITY AND SHE SAID NO MORE
WHEREVER THE BRONTES COULD BE NATIONAL THEY WERE SO WITH THE SAME TENACITY OF ATTACHMENT WHICH MADE THEM SUFFER AS THEY DID WHENEVER THEY LEFT HAWORTH
AFTER GIVING CAREFUL CONSIDERATION TO THIS MASS OF CONFLICTING EVIDENCE I HAVE MADE SUCH ALTERATIONS AND OMISSIONS IN THIS CHAPTER AS SEEM TO ME TO BE REQUIRED
AND I FEAR MUCH TIME WILL ELAPSE BEFORE ANY PLAN IS EXECUTED WRITE AS SOON AS YOU CAN
ENCORE UN AN TOUT AU PLUS ET L'OEUVRE ETAIT ACHEVEE ET BIEN ACHEVEE
I HAVE BEEN TWICE TO THE D.'S THOSE COUSINS OF MARY'S OF WHOM I HAVE BEFORE MADE MENTION WHEN SHE LEAVES BRUXELLES I SHALL HAVE NOWHERE TO GO TO
LEAVE ME OUT IN YOUR CALCULATIONS
I TOLD HER VERY WARMLY THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO STAY AT HOME
BUT READ IT SIR
THE SMALL OLD-FASHIONED WINDOW-PANES GLITTER LIKE LOOKING GLASS
ARTHUR BELL NICHOLLS A.B AND DAUGHTER OF THE REV
AND AFTER A SEASON OF UTTER QUIET HER FATHER SOUGHT FOR HER THE ENLIVENING SOCIETY OF HER TWO FRIENDS MARY AND MARTHA T
CHARLOTTE WAS CONSIDERED THE MOST TALKATIVE OF THE SISTERS--A BRIGHT CLEVER LITTLE CHILD HER GREAT FRIEND WAS A CERTAIN MELLANY HANE SO MR BRONTE SPELLS THE NAME WHOSE BROTHER PAID FOR HER SCHOOLING AND WHO HAD NO REMARKABLE TALENT EXCEPT FOR MUSIC WHICH HER BROTHER'S CIRCUMSTANCES FORBADE HER TO CULTIVATE
ENTRE CES DEUX ILES RIEN QU'UN VASTE ET BRULANT DESERT ET L'OCEAN IMMENSE
THEIR SURLY INDEPENDENCE WOULD REVOLT FROM THE IDEA OF ANY ONE HAVING A RIGHT FROM HIS OFFICE TO INQUIRE INTO THEIR CONDITION TO COUNSEL OR TO ADMONISH THEM
HIS SERVANT RUBBED HIM TO RESTORE THE CIRCULATION
BELL DESIRE ME TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUGGESTION RESPECTING THE ADVERTISEMENTS
THE WATCHERS WOULD FAIN HAVE SPOKEN BUT DURST NOT FOR FEAR OF TAKING OFF EMILY'S ATTENTION AND CAUSING HER TO AVERT HER HEAD FOR A MOMENT FROM THE ENRAGED BRUTE
T MEANT CHARLES TIMMS OR CHARLOTTE TOMKINS THERE ARE TWO OR THREE THINGS NOTICEABLE IN THE LETTER FROM WHICH THESE EXTRACTS ARE TAKEN
HERE FOLLOWS A SERIES OF LETTERS NOT DATED BUT BELONGING TO THE LATTER PORTION OF THIS YEAR
THE YEARLY EXPENSE FOR EACH PUPIL ACCORDING TO THE ENTRANCE-RULES GIVEN IN THE REPORT FOR 1842 AND I BELIEVE THEY HAD NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SCHOOLS IN 1823 WAS AS FOLLOWS
SHE HAD BEEN LEARNING BY HEART A PRETTY LITTLE HYMN OF MR BRONTE'S COMPOSING
MR W
MR W
AND AS TO MY HANDWRITING OR THE LADYLIKE TOUCHES IN MY STYLE AND IMAGERY YOU MUST NOT DRAW ANY CONCLUSION FROM THAT--I MAY EMPLOY AN AMANUENSIS
I WAS PARTLY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS ANSWER AND PARTLY GRATIFIED
THE INFANTA CAUSED OTHER AND SMALLER HOUSES TO BE BUILT IN HER NEW STREET TO SERVE AS RESIDENCES FOR HER GARDE NOBLE AND FOR HER GARDE BOURGEOISE A SMALL HABITATION EACH SOME OF WHICH STILL REMAIN TO REMIND US OF ENGLISH ALMSHOUSES
SHE SAID WHEN WE LEFT HIM THAT IS A HIDEOUS MAN CHARLOTTE I THOUGHT HE IS INDEED CHAPTER X EARLY IN MARCH 1841 MISS BRONTE OBTAINED HER SECOND AND LAST SITUATION AS A GOVERNESS
YOU SAY IT IS IN CONTEMPLATION FOR YOU TO LEAVE I AM SORRY FOR IT
SHE SAID TO ME MR SOUTHEY'S LETTER WAS KIND AND ADMIRABLE
EVEN AN INHABITANT OF THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTY OF LANCASTER IS STRUCK BY THE PECULIAR FORCE OF CHARACTER WHICH THE YORKSHIREMEN DISPLAY
OPPOSITE TO THE LOWEST FLIGHT OF STEPS THERE IS A LARGE OLD MANSION FACING YOU WITH A SPACIOUS WALLED GARDEN BEHIND--AND TO THE RIGHT OF IT
I REGRET THE CHANGE FROM BRUSSELS TO LILLE ON MANY ACCOUNTS CHIEFLY THAT I SHALL NOT SEE MARTHA
THE CHURCH ITSELF LOOKS ANCIENT AND SOLITARY AND AS IF LEFT BEHIND BY THE GREAT STONE MILLS OF A FLOURISHING INDEPENDENT FIRM AND THE SOLID SQUARE CHAPEL BUILT BY THE MEMBERS OF THAT DENOMINATION
HENCEFORWARD THEIR DAYS WERE EMBITTERED AND THE NATURAL REST OF THEIR NIGHTS DESTROYED BY HIS PAROXYSMS OF REMORSE
HE HAD BEEN KILLED IN A DUEL IN LONDON THAT VERY SAME AFTERNOON OF DECEMBER 9TH 1684
MARY WAS TAKEN AWAY TO BRUXELLES
STRANGE EVENTS BY LORD C
POOR MISGUIDED FELLOW
NOT DISPIRITED HOWEVER BY THE DELAY BRANWELL DETERMINED TO TRY A SIMILAR VENTURE AND ADDRESSED THE FOLLOWING LETTER TO WORDSWORTH
DON'T DECEIVE YOURSELF BY IMAGINING I HAVE A BIT OF REAL GOODNESS ABOUT ME
SHE WAS ALWAYS PATIENT AND TRACTABLE AND WOULD SUBMIT QUIETLY TO OCCASIONAL OPPRESSION EVEN WHEN SHE FELT IT KEENLY
HEGER MAIS JE SAIS QU'IL EST PEU DE CARACTERES AUSSI NOBLES AUSSI ADMIRABLES QUE LE SIEN
AND FINALLY MOUNTED HIS GIG AND DROVE AWAY WHILE SHE WAS STILL URGING THAT SHE MUST RETURN TO HER OWN HOUSE AND TO HER DOMESTIC DUTIES FOR WHICH SHE HAD PROVIDED NO SUBSTITUTE
AUGUST 4TH 1839
FROM THIS TIME HE DEVOTED HIMSELF WITH THE FERVOUR OF A WESLEY AND SOMETHING OF THE FANATICISM OF A WHITFIELD TO CALLING OUT A RELIGIOUS LIFE AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS
THE REST OF THE DAY WAS SPENT IN SOCIAL ENJOYMENT
SHE HAD GOT WHAT SHE WANTED FRENCH AND THERE WAS AT LEAST NOVELTY IN A NEW PLACE IF NO IMPROVEMENT
BUT NOW THAT MARY D
AND THEN I HOPE TO SEE ALL YOUR FACES AGAIN
AND THE PAIN OF WHICH COULD ONLY BE SMOTHERED FOR A TIME UNDER THE DILIGENT FULFILMENT OF PRESENT DUTY
AND IN SECRET SHE TOO DREADED A SIMILAR LOSS FOR HERSELF
AND THE KENNELS FOR THE DUCAL HOUNDS OCCUPIED THE PLACE WHERE MADAME HEGER'S PENSIONNAT NOW STANDS
TO A SPECTATOR THOUGH RUDE THEY WERE AMUSING AND SIGNIFICANT FORETELLING WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED AND WHAT WAS AFTERWARDS REALISED ON THE ADVENT OF A NEW INCUMBENT IF THEY DEEMED HIM AN INTRUDER
EMILY AND HE DON'T DRAW WELL TOGETHER AT ALL
THE FOREHEAD IS MASSIVE THE EYE WELL SET AND THE EXPRESSION OF IT FINE AND INTELLECTUAL
FAINT INDEED AND OFTEN LOST SIGHT OF IN THE VIVID PAIN AND CONSTANT PRESSURE OF ANXIETY RESPECTING THEIR BROTHER

THEY WERE SWIFT WHO COULD ESCAPE THE LASH OF THE PARSON BY SNEAKING OUT THE BACK WAY
QUAND DONC S'EST-IL LAISSE ENCHAINER PAR UN LIEN D'AFFECTION
SHE FOUND IN THE BLEAK SOLITUDE MANY AND DEAR DELIGHTS
I FELT IN MY HEART SHE WOULD DIE IF SHE DID NOT GO HOME AND WITH THIS CONVICTION OBTAINED HER RECALL
I DO NOT SAY THIS BY WAY OF COMPLAINING OF MY OWN LOT
SAT READING OR WHISPERING LOW IN THE CHILDREN'S STUDY OR WANDERED OUT ON THE HILL-SIDE HAND IN HAND
HER LETTERS AND YOURS ARE ONE OF MY FEW PLEASURES
THAT WOULD BE JUMPING OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN INTO THE FIRE
HE WAS INTIMATE WITH CARTWRIGHT AND AWARE OF THE ATTACK LIKELY TO BE MADE ON HIS MILL
AND AFTER A CONFLICT OF TWENTY MINUTES DURING WHICH TWO OF THE ASSAILANTS WERE KILLED AND SEVERAL WOUNDED THEY WITHDREW IN CONFUSION LEAVING MR CARTWRIGHT MASTER OF THE FIELD BUT SO DIZZY AND EXHAUSTED NOW THE PERIL WAS PAST THAT HE FORGOT THE NATURE OF HIS DEFENCES AND INJURED HIS LEG RATHER SERIOUSLY BY ONE OF THE SPIKED ROLLERS IN ATTEMPTING TO GO UP HIS OWN STAIRCASE
MR BRONTE SAYS,--"THIS LIVING HAS FOR ITS PATRONS THE VICAR OF BRADFORD AND CERTAIN TRUSTEES
SHE THANKFULLY ACKNOWLEDGED THIS KINDNESS IN WRITING TO URGE HER FRIEND AFRESH TO COME AND SEE HER
WITH THEIR IMPULSIVE NATURES IT WAS POSITIVE REPOSE TO HAVE LEARNT IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE TO EXTERNAL LAWS
THE SECOND SON WAS PERHAPS APPRENTICED TO A SURGEON OR APOTHECARY OR A SOLICITOR
WE ARE SUCH ODD ANIMALS THAT WE PREFER THIS MODE OF CONTRIVANCE TO HAVING A NEW FACE AMONGST US

SHE SAID SHE SHOULD LIKE ANY CHANGE AT FIRST AS SHE HAD LIKED BRUSSELS AT FIRST AND SHE THOUGHT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME POSSIBILITY FOR SOME PEOPLE OF HAVING A LIFE OF MORE VARIETY AND MORE COMMUNION WITH HUMAN KIND BUT SHE SAW NONE FOR HER
I WAS TANTALISED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FACULTIES UNEXERCISED,--THEN ALL COLLAPSED AND I DESPAIRED
CONVERSATIONS
CONVERSATIONS
CONVERSATIONS
ALTOGETHER SMELLS WOULD LINGER ABOUT THE HOUSE AND DAMP CLING TO IT
HIS GREAT AMUSEMENT AND OCCUPATION HAD BEEN COCK-FIGHTING
IT TOOK HOURS TO RECONCILE HER TO THE DISCOVERY I HAD MADE AND DAYS TO PERSUADE HER THAT SUCH POEMS MERITED PUBLICATION MEANTIME MY YOUNGER SISTER QUIETLY PRODUCED SOME OF HER OWN COMPOSITIONS INTIMATING THAT SINCE EMILY'S HAD GIVEN ME PLEASURE I MIGHT LIKE TO LOOK AT HERS
I CANNOT GIVE YOU MY EXCUSES FOR THIS BEHAVIOUR
LEUR AVANCEMENT EST VOTRE OEUVRE BIEN PLUS QUE LA NOTRE
EXTREMELY
THOUGH ONE DIED AT HER OWN HOME SINKING UNDER THE STATE OF HEALTH WHICH FOLLOWED IT
IF IT HAS BEEN OTHERWISE SHE HAS BEEN SORELY TOSSED WHILE WE HAVE BEEN SLEEPING IN OUR BEDS OR LYING AWAKE THINKING ABOUT HER
ANY ONE MAY FANCY HOW SUCH AN EVENT AS THIS WOULD RANKLE IN CHARLOTTE'S MIND
THESE REBELLIOUS AND ABSURD EMOTIONS WERE ONLY MOMENTARY
VOILA LA DIVORCE QUE JE VEUX
THE TRADITIONAL COLOURING SHOWS THE ANIMUS WITH WHICH HIS MEMORY IS REGARDED BY ONE SET OF PEOPLE
THE CHANGE FROM HER OWN HOME TO A SCHOOL AND FROM HER OWN VERY NOISELESS VERY SECLUDED BUT UNRESTRICTED AND UNARTIFICIAL MODE OF LIFE TO ONE OF DISCIPLINED ROUTINE THOUGH UNDER THE KINDEST AUSPICES WAS WHAT SHE FAILED IN ENDURING
I CHOSE THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON AND TWO SONS CHRISTOPHER NORTH AND CO AND MR ABERNETHY
AND FROM THE OPINIONS OF HIS STRONG AND INDEPENDENT MIND THEY WOULD GATHER MUCH FOOD FOR THOUGHT
SHE CAME HOME I UNDERSTAND LAST WEDNESDAY AND IS ONLY TO BE ALLOWED THREE WEEKS VACATION BECAUSE THE FAMILY SHE IS WITH ARE GOING TO SCARBOROUGH
I SHALL BE DISCONTENTED AT NOTHING
OF COURSE I WAS IN ONE SENSE PLEASED WITH THE GIFT--PLEASED THAT THEY SHOULD THINK OF ME SO FAR OFF AMIDST THE EXCITEMENTS OF ONE OF THE MOST SPLENDID CAPITALS OF EUROPE
ELLE PERDAIT DONC A LA FOIS UN RESTE D'IGNORANCE ET UN RESTE PLUS GENANT ENCORE DE TIMIDITE
I'M OBLIGED TO THEM AND I HOPE YOU'LL TELL THEM SO
NO DOUBT ALL WHO ENTER UPON THE CAREER OF A GOVERNESS HAVE TO RELINQUISH MUCH
ONE IS THE GRAPHIC VIVIDNESS WITH WHICH THE TIME OF THE YEAR THE HOUR OF THE EVENING THE FEELING OF COLD AND DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE SOUND OF THE NIGHT-WINDS SWEEPING OVER THE DESOLATE SNOW-COVERED MOORS COMING NEARER AND NEARER AND AT LAST SHAKING THE VERY DOOR OF THE ROOM WHERE THEY WERE SITTING--FOR IT OPENED OUT DIRECTLY ON THAT BLEAK WIDE EXPANSE--IS CONTRASTED WITH THE GLOW AND BUSY BRIGHTNESS OF THE CHEERFUL KITCHEN WHERE THESE REMARKABLE CHILDREN ARE GROUPED
AND THE WATERS FLOW OVER A BED OF LARGE ROUND WHITE PEBBLES WHICH A FLOOD HEAVES UP AND MOVES ON EITHER SIDE OUT OF ITS IMPETUOUS WAY TILL IN SOME PARTS THEY ALMOST FORM A WALL
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN HAWORTH WAS A VERY PLEASANT PLACE TO ME
SHE WAS THE THIRD DAUGHTER OF MR THOMAS BRANWELL MERCHANT OF PENZANCE
THE DESCENDANTS OF MANY WHO SERVED UNDER CROMWELL AT DUNBAR LIVE ON THE SAME LANDS AS THEIR ANCESTORS OCCUPIED THEN
EACH PUPIL FOR BOARD AND FRENCH ALONE BUT A SEPARATE ROOM WAS TO BE ALLOWED FOR THIS SUM
BRONTE THEY MUST HAVE REPLIED PRETTY SPEEDILY FOR ON JANUARY 31ST SHE WRITES AGAIN GENTLEMEN SINCE YOU AGREE TO UNDERTAKE THE PUBLICATION OF THE WORK RESPECTING WHICH I APPLIED TO YOU I SHOULD WISH NOW TO KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE COST OF PAPER AND PRINTING
A FRIEND WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE PLACE WHEN CHARLOTTE BRONTE WAS AT SCHOOL HAS DESCRIBED SOME EVENTS WHICH OCCURRED THEN AMONG THEM A SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE AT THE LOWER CHAPEL AT HECKMONDWIKE WILL GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THE PEOPLE AT THAT TIME
THE HABIT OF MAKING OUT WHICH HAD GROWN WITH HER GROWTH AND STRENGTHENED WITH HER STRENGTH HAD BECOME A PART OF HER NATURE
I CAN HARDLY WRITE I HAVE SUCH A DREARY WEIGHT AT MY HEART
IT WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE IT WAS BUILT WITHOUT ENCLOSURE AND OPEN TO THE ADJOINING FIELDS OR MOORS
SENSIBLE AND SCIENTIFIC PROSE BOLD AND VIGOROUS EFFORTS IN MY WALK IN LIFE WOULD GIVE A FARTHER TITLE TO THE NOTICE OF THE WORLD
I CANNOT NAME ANOTHER MODEL WHICH I SHOULD LIKE IT PRECISELY TO RESEMBLE YET I THINK A DUODECIMO FORM AND A SOMEWHAT REDUCED THOUGH STILL CLEAR TYPE WOULD BE PREFERABLE
BUT HE WAS A MAN OF AN IMPERIAL WILL AND BY IT HE BORE DOWN OPPOSITION TILL TRADITION REPRESENTS HIM AS HAVING SOMETHING GRIMLY DEMONIAC ABOUT HIM
I USED TO WONDER AT HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH SUCH SUBJECTS MAY 10TH 1836
THIS LARGE FAMILY WERE REMARKABLE FOR GREAT PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND MUCH PERSONAL BEAUTY
IN THE SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR CHARLOTTE WENT TO PAY HER FIRST VISIT TO HER FRIEND E IT TOOK HER INTO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ROE HEAD AND BROUGHT HER INTO PLEASANT CONTACT WITH MANY OF HER OLD SCHOOL-FELLOWS
WHEN YOU DO CONFER A FAVOUR IT IS OFTEN DONE IN STYLE
A RARE GOOD ONE SAID HE
WHEN HE LEFT IRELAND TO GO TO CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HE WAS AS AMBITIOUS AS I AM NOW
THE FIRST DAY OF LENT WE HAD COFFEE WITHOUT MILK FOR BREAKFAST
BUT WHEN MISS SCATCHERD WAS HELD UP TO OPPROBRIUM THEY ALSO RECOGNISED IN THE WRITER OF JANE EYRE AN UNCONSCIOUSLY AVENGING SISTER OF THE SUFFERER
OF COURSE THEY DID NOT NOW LOOK FORWARD TO SETTLING AT BURLINGTON OR ANY OTHER PLACE WHICH WOULD TAKE THEM AWAY FROM THEIR FATHER
I GET AN INTERESTING IMPRESSION OF OLD AGE UPON MY FACE
AND IT MUST LIKEWISE BE BORNE IN MIND--BY THOSE WHO SURVIVING HER LOOK BACK UPON HER LIFE FROM THEIR MOUNT OF OBSERVATION--HOW NO DISTASTE NO SUFFERING EVER MADE HER SHRINK FROM ANY COURSE WHICH SHE BELIEVED IT TO BE HER DUTY TO ENGAGE IN
BUT EMILY AND ANNE AND I KEEP IT IN VIEW
IT IS ONLY THE TALKING PART THAT I FEAR
WHEN ANNE CAME DOWN SHE SAID ONE SHOULD BE HERS
I ALWAYS FELT QUITE AT HOME WITH HER
HE WAS BORN ON PATRICKMAS DAY MARCH 17 1777 AND EARLY GAVE TOKENS OF EXTRAORDINARY QUICKNESS AND INTELLIGENCE
I MENTIONED HAVING SENT FOR MY BOOKS CLOTHES C
IN JANUARY 1845 CHARLOTTE SAYS:--"BRANWELL HAS BEEN QUIETER AND LESS IRRITABLE ON THE WHOLE THIS TIME THAN HE WAS IN SUMMER
THERE_--THERE IS NO CHANGE BUT FOR THE WORSE MEANWHILE THE PRINTING OF THE VOLUME OF POEMS WAS QUIETLY PROCEEDING
HAWORTH PARSONAGE IS--AS I MENTIONED IN THE FIRST CHAPTER--AN OBLONG STONE HOUSE FACING DOWN THE HILL ON WHICH THE VILLAGE STANDS AND WITH THE FRONT DOOR RIGHT OPPOSITE TO THE WESTERN DOOR OF THE CHURCH DISTANT ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS
I KNOW SOMEBODY TO WHOSE KNEE THE BLACK CAT LOVES TO CLIMB AGAINST WHOSE SHOULDER AND CHEEK IT LIKES TO PURR
IN HALF A YEAR I COULD ACQUIRE A THOROUGH FAMILIARITY WITH FRENCH
I NEVER DID
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HOW CAN I GO VISITING
THERE WERE SEVERAL SUNDAY-SCHOOLS
THE SEDENTARY AND MONOTONOUS NATURE OF THE LIFE TOO WAS PREYING UPON HER HEALTH AND SPIRITS ALTHOUGH WITH NECESSITY AS HER MISTRESS SHE MIGHT HARDLY LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS EVEN TO HERSELF
I OFTEN HEAR FROM HER
IN THE LIFE OF OLIVER HEYWOOD THERE ARE TWO QUOTATIONS WHICH SHOW WHAT SORT OF FOOD WAS PROVIDED FOR ARVILLS IN QUIET NONCONFORMIST CONNECTIONS IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
THE OTHERS MARCH 1828
IT IS NATURAL TO ME TO SUBMIT AND VERY UNNATURAL TO COMMAND
IF I COULD I WOULD ALWAYS WORK IN SILENCE AND OBSCURITY AND LET MY EFFORTS BE KNOWN BY THEIR RESULTS
I INTEND CAREFULLY TO ABSTAIN FROM INTRODUCING THE NAMES OF ANY LIVING PEOPLE RESPECTING WHOM I MAY HAVE TO TELL UNPLEASANT TRUTHS OR TO QUOTE SEVERE REMARKS FROM MISS BRONTE'S LETTERS
GIVING DIRECTIONS TO HIS HUNTED GUESTS TO STEAL OUT AT THE BACK DOOR THROUGH WHICH PROBABLY MANY A NE'ER-DO-WEEL HAS ESCAPED FROM GOOD MR GRIMSHAW'S HORSEWHIP THE LANDLORD AND SOME OF THE STABLE-BOYS RODE THE HORSES BELONGING TO THE PARTY FROM BRADFORD BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BEFORE HIS FRONT DOOR AMONG THE FIERCELY-EXPECTANT CROWD
I CALLED ONCE UPON A TIME ON A MOST RESPECTABLE YEOMAN AND I WAS IN LANGUAGE EARNEST AND HOMELY PRESSED TO ACCEPT THE HOSPITALITY OF THE HOUSE
CHARLOTTE WAS CERTAINLY AFRAID OF DEATH
SHE HAS GRUDGED NO LABOUR AND SCARCELY ANY EXPENSE TO THAT END
JULY 26TH 1839
DISINTERESTED AND ENERGETIC SHE CERTAINLY IS
IT WAS THE LITERAL TRUE ACCOUNT OF WHAT EMILY HAD DONE
I HAD NOTHING TO ANSWER
MY PUPILS ARE WILD AND UNBROKEN BUT APPARENTLY WELL-DISPOSED
I THINK YOU WILL NOT REFUSE
SHE WAS DISMISSED AND THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN FORCED AGAINST HER WILL TO SERVE AS HEAD NURSE TOOK THE PLACE OF HOUSEKEEPER
THE BELGIANS HATE THE ENGLISH
I MANAGE THE IRONING AND KEEP THE ROOMS CLEAN
THE FIRST FROM THORESBY TELLS OF COLD POSSETS STEWED PRUNES CAKE AND CHEESE AS BEING THE ARVILL AFTER OLIVER HEYWOOD'S FUNERAL
TO THIS FRIEND CHARLOTTE ADDRESSED THE FOLLOWING LETTERS MARCH 3RD 1846
HE HAD HIS MILL PREPARED FOR AN ASSAULT
I BENT QUIETLY AND NOW I TRUST THE STORM IS BLOWING OVER ME
HARDLY HAD HE UTTERED THE FIRST WORD BEFORE UP ROSE THE SINGERS HEADED BY A TALL FIERCE-LOOKING WEAVER WHO GAVE OUT A HYMN AND ALL SANG IT AT THE VERY TOP OF THEIR VOICES AIDED BY THOSE OF THEIR FRIENDS WHO WERE IN THE CHAPEL
THEY LEAVE US TO-DAY
THE SISTERS HARDLY RECOGNISED THEIR OWN OR EACH OTHERS POWERS BUT THEY KNEW HIS
BUT THEY WERE ALL STRONG AGAIN AND AT ANY RATE CHARLOTTE AND ANNE MUST PUT THEIR SHOULDERS TO THE WHEEL
MARTHA ALONE REMAINED--STILL AND QUIET FOR EVER IN THE CEMETERY BEYOND THE PORTE DE LOUVAIN
WRITE TO ME OFTEN
THE MIXTURE OF AGRICULTURAL WITH MANUFACTURING LABOUR THAT ENSUED AND PREVAILED IN THE WEST RIDING UP TO A VERY RECENT PERIOD SOUNDS PLEASANT ENOUGH AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME WHEN THE CLASSICAL IMPRESSION IS LEFT AND THE DETAILS FORGOTTEN OR ONLY BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY THOSE WHO EXPLORE THE FEW REMOTE PARTS OF ENGLAND WHERE THE CUSTOM STILL LINGERS
THIS MOST LIKELY WAS THE FIRST OF THOSE ADVENTUROUS LETTERS THAT PASSED THROUGH THE LITTLE POST-OFFICE OF HAWORTH
BUT THERE IS NO APPEARANCE OF THIS IN THE EXTERNAL ASPECT OF THE PRESENT EDIFICE UNLESS IT BE IN THE TWO EASTERN WINDOWS WHICH REMAIN UNMODERNIZED AND IN THE LOWER PART OF THE STEEPLE
2ND 1841
YES
YES
MY DEAR DEAR E I AM AT THIS MOMENT TREMBLING ALL OVER WITH EXCITEMENT AFTER READING YOUR NOTE
RAIN HAS BEAT ALL DAY ON THAT CHURCH TOWER HAWORTH
HOW LONG ARE WE LIKELY TO BE SEPARATED
AND MEANWHILE THE COURSE OF EXISTENCE MOVED DREARILY ALONG FROM DAY TO DAY WITH THE ANXIOUS SISTERS WHO MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN THEIR SENSE OF AUTHORSHIP IN THE VITAL CARE GNAWING AT THEIR HEARTS
THE BLACK BULL IS NEAR THE TOP OF THE LONG STEEP HAWORTH STREET AND AT THE BOTTOM CLOSE BY THE BRIDGE ON THE ROAD TO KEIGHLEY IS A TURNPIKE
IN ALL THERE SEEMED MORE ESTABLISHMENTS LIKE THE ONE WHICH THE SISTERS WISHED TO SET UP THAN COULD BE SUPPORTED
PAPA SAYS HE HIGHLY APPROVES OF MY FRIENDSHIP WITH YOU AND HE WISHES ME TO CONTINUE IT THROUGH LIFE A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BRONTES--A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHIRE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGGIST'S SHOP IN HAWORTH AND FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTRESS AND NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLDS ROUND--TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBY'S FRACTURED LEG

AT THE TOP OF EVERY HILL YOU SEE SOMETHING SHE TOOK LONG SOLITARY WALKS ON THE OCCASIONAL HOLIDAYS MR BRONTE TOOK HIS DAUGHTERS TO THE RUE D'ISABELLE BRUSSELS
CAR C'EST TRAHIR QUE DE CONSEILLER DE TEMPORISER AVEC BUONAPARTE
THE 8TH RULE IS,--"ALL LETTERS AND PARCELS ARE INSPECTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT BUT THIS IS A VERY PREVALENT REGULATION IN ALL YOUNG LADIES SCHOOLS WHERE I THINK IT IS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SCHOOLMISTRESS MAY EXERCISE THIS PRIVILEGE ALTHOUGH IT IS CERTAINLY UNWISE IN HER TO INSIST TOO FREQUENTLY UPON IT
IN THIS STRUGGLE HER HEALTH WAS QUICKLY BROKEN
ON THE EXPORT OF UNDYED WOOLLEN CLOTHS MET BY A PROHIBITION ON THE PART OF THE STATES OF HOLLAND OF THE IMPORT OF ENGLISH DYED CLOTHS INJURED THE TRADE OF THE WEST RIDING MANUFACTURERS CONSIDERABLY
IN A LETTER DATED SEPTEMBER 18TH SHE SAYS FOR SOME YEARS I HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY MY OWN MISTRESS SUBJECT TO NO CONTROL WHATEVER
A LOW NERVOUS FEVER WAS GAINING UPON MISS BRONTE
IN THOSE POINTS WHICH ARE OBVIOUS TO THE ORDINARY RUN OF PEOPLE AND WHICH I KNOW ARE NOT PLEASING
I REMEMBER ALSO THE DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER IT WOULD PASS THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND THE PROPHECIES THAT IT WOULD NOT
UP AND DOWN THE HOUSE WERE TO BE FOUND MANY STANDARD WORKS OF A SOLID KIND

WHAT THINK YOU
ACCORDINGLY IT IS SAID HE ARMED HIMSELF AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AND WAS PREPARED TO COME TO THE RESCUE IN THE EVENT OF A SIGNAL BEING GIVEN THAT AID WAS NEEDED
MR BRONTE DETERMINED TO ACCOMPANY HIS DAUGHTERS
AGAIN THEREFORE I MUST SIGN MYSELF C
WRITE WHENEVER YOU CAN
HE WAS PRESENT HOWEVER IN THE CLERICAL HABILIMENTS OF HIS ORDER I MAY ALSO ADD THAT AMONG THE MANY WHO WERE PRESENT AT THOSE SAD SUNDAY ORGIES THE MAJORITY WERE NON-RESIDENTS AND CAME FROM THOSE MOORLAND FASTNESSES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE PARISH LOCALLY DESIGNATED AS OVVER TH STEYRES ONE STAGE MORE REMOTE THAN HAWORTH FROM MODERN CIVILIZATION
I SHALL HAVE OCCASION AFTERWARDS TO GIVE ONE OR TWO INSTANCES OF THE WARM FEELINGS AND EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE ON SUBJECTS OF BOTH HOME AND FOREIGN POLITICS EXISTING AT THE PRESENT DAY IN THE VILLAGES LYING WEST AND EAST OF THE MOUNTAINOUS RIDGE THAT SEPARATES YORKSHIRE AND LANCASHIRE
DEAR AUNT SEPT
MATRIMONY DID NOT ENTER INTO THE SCHEME OF HER LIFE BUT GOOD SOUND EARNEST LABOUR DID
BUT TO THE ZEALOUS LEARNER ALPS ON ALPS ARISE NO SOONER IS ONE DIFFICULTY SURMOUNTED THAN SOME OTHER DESIRABLE ATTAINMENT APPEARS AND MUST BE LABOURED AFTER
WOULD TO GOD THEY MIGHT BE THE LAST WHO MET WITH SUCH A MISERABLE RETURN
BUT IT IS THE LIVING IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES--THE ESTRANGEMENT FROM ONE'S REAL CHARACTER--THE ADOPTION OF A COLD RIGID APATHETIC EXTERIOR THAT IS PAINFUL YOU WILL NOT MENTION OUR SCHOOL PROJECT AT PRESENT
I HAVE HEARD HER ALLUDE TO AN UNFORTUNATE COOK WHO USED AT TIMES TO SPOIL THE PORRIDGE BUT WHO SHE SAID WAS SOON DISMISSED THE RECOLLECTIONS LEFT OF THE FOUR BRONTE SISTERS AT THIS PERIOD OF THEIR LIVES ON THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO ASSOCIATED WITH THEM ARE NOT VERY DISTINCT
AND YET THERE WAS MUCH IN BRUSSELS TO STRIKE A RESPONSIVE CHORD IN HER POWERFUL IMAGINATION
CHARLOTTE NATURALLY LOOKED WITH CURIOSITY TO PEOPLE OF HER OWN CONDITION
AS A PEOPLE THESE MOUNTAINEERS HAVE EVER BEEN ACCESSIBLE TO GENTLENESS AND TRUTH SO FAR AS I HAVE KNOWN THEM
WE MUST ALL I FEAR PREPARE FOR A SEASON OF DISTRESS AND DISQUIETUDE
THE OLD STONE HOUSES ARE HIGH COMPARED TO THE WIDTH OF THE STREET WHICH MAKES AN ABRUPT TURN BEFORE REACHING THE MORE LEVEL GROUND AT THE HEAD OF THE VILLAGE SO THAT THE STEEP ASPECT OF THE PLACE IN ONE PART IS ALMOST LIKE THAT OF A WALL
NOW LET US BEGIN TO QUARREL
AND OF ELIZABETH BRONTE HER SISTER WHO DIED JUNE 15TH 1825 IN THE 11TH YEAR OF HER AGE
I SEND YOU TWO MORE CIRCULARS A MONTH LATER SHE SAYS WE HAVE MADE NO ALTERATIONS YET IN OUR HOUSE

I ONLY HATE MY FORMER FLIPPANCY AND FORWARDNESS
I KNOW NOT HOW TO PRAY

YOU WILL SEE THAT I HAVE FIXED THE SUM AT 35_L WHICH I THINK IS THE JUST MEDIUM CONSIDERING ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES THIS WAS WRITTEN IN JULY
WE WAITED LONG AND ANXIOUSLY FOR YOU ON THE THURSDAY THAT YOU PROMISED TO COME
AND CONSTANTLY MAINTAINED THAT SHE WAS IN THE RIGHT AND I IN THE WRONG WHEN WE DIFFERED ON THE POINT OF THEIR UNUSUAL EXCELLENCE
MON PAPA MA TANTE ET LE MONSIEUR DENT MEN FRERE AVOIT PARLE FURENT TOUS ASSEMBLES DANS LE SALON ET EN PEU DE TEMPS JE M'Y RENDIS AUSSI
2ND 1830
THE BLACK GLOOM HUNG OVER WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN THE BRIGHTEST HOPE OF THE FAMILY--OVER BRANWELL AND THE MYSTERY IN WHICH HIS WAYWARD CONDUCT WAS ENVELOPED
ARE REQUESTED TO SEND HER THE NAME AND NUMBER OF THOSE PERIODICALS IN WHICH SUCH NOTICES APPEAR
BUT TO CHARLOTTE BRONTE IT WAS A PERPETUAL ATTEMPT TO FORCE ALL HER FACULTIES INTO A DIRECTION FOR WHICH THE WHOLE OF HER PREVIOUS LIFE HAD UNFITTED THEM
BUT I NEED NOT TALK OF EITHER FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NOW FOR I RATHER IMAGINE THERE IS SMALL CHANCE OF MY EVER GOING AT ALL
THIS EVENING REMINDS ME TOO FORCIBLY OF ANOTHER EVENING SOME YEARS AGO
PATRICK BRONTE IS A NATIVE OF THE COUNTY DOWN IN IRELAND
SHE USED TO HEAR OVER AGAIN DELIVERED WITH AUTHORITY ALL THE LECTURES I HAD BEEN USED TO GIVE HER AT SCHOOL ON DESPOTIC ARISTOCRACY MERCENARY PRIESTHOOD C
IS IT AGE OR WHAT ELSE THAT CHANGES ME SO ALAS
IN A FEW DAYS OUR VACATION WILL BEGIN
BUT I MUST THANK YOU FOR THE KIND AND WISE ADVICE YOU HAVE CONDESCENDED TO GIVE ME
THE FIXED CONVICTION I HELD AND HOLD OF THE WORTH OF THESE POEMS HAS NOT INDEED RECEIVED THE CONFIRMATION OF MUCH FAVOURABLE CRITICISM
THE HALF-LUDICROUS NATURE OF SOME OF THEIR GRIEVANCES HAS LINGERED ON IN TRADITION
IT WOULD BE TOO SELFISH OF ME
THE THREE GIRLS USED TO WALK UPWARDS TOWARD THE PURPLE-BLACK MOORS THE SWEEPING SURFACE OF WHICH WAS BROKEN BY HERE AND THERE A STONE-QUARRY
THERE WAS A GREAT INTERNAL STRUGGLE
AND WHO PROBABLY EVEN NOW ALTHOUGH SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT HAD BEGUN HIS SERVICE TO HER IN THE SAME TENDER AND FAITHFUL SPIRIT AS THAT IN WHICH JACOB SERVED FOR RACHEL
CLOSE OUTSIDE THE PARK AN OLD STONE GABLED HOUSE NOW A ROADSIDE INN BUT WHICH BEARS THE NAME OF THE THREE NUNS AND HAS A PICTURED SIGN TO CORRESPOND
INDEED THOSE WHO COME TO A FRENCH SCHOOL FOR INSTRUCTION OUGHT PREVIOUSLY TO HAVE ACQUIRED A CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE OTHERWISE THEY WILL LOSE A GREAT DEAL OF TIME FOR THE COURSE OF INSTRUCTION IS ADAPTED TO NATIVES AND NOT TO FOREIGNERS
BUT AS EVERY ONE LIKES TO JUDGE FOR HIMSELF I COPY THE SIX OPENING STANZAS--ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WHOLE AND CERTAINLY NOT THE WORST
BUT IT IS AN IMBECILITY WHICH I REJECT WITH CONTEMPT FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE NEITHER FORTUNE NOR BEAUTY TO MAKE MARRIAGE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF THEIR WISHES AND HOPES AND THE AIM OF ALL THEIR ACTIONS
I HAVE SUFFICIENT MONEY FOR THE UNDERTAKING AND I HOPE NOW SUFFICIENT QUALIFICATIONS TO GIVE ME A FAIR CHANCE OF SUCCESS
YET EVEN THEN THERE IS A DESPONDENCY IN SOME OF HER EXPRESSIONS THAT TOO SADLY REMINDS ONE OF SOME OF COWPER'S LETTERS
IT IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE THAT I HAVE REALLY DREADED THE VACATION
THE JOURNEY FROM PENZANCE TO LEEDS IN THOSE DAYS WAS BOTH VERY LONG AND VERY EXPENSIVE
THE TREMBLING SISTERS SICK WITH FRIGHT WOULD IMPLORE THEIR FATHER NOT TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THIS DANGER
AND MADAME HEGER AND THE PENSIONNAT UPROOTED AND UNCERTAIN OF ANY FUTURE EXISTENCE
YET ALL EXERCISE OF HER STRONGEST AND MOST CHARACTERISTIC FACULTIES WAS NOW OUT OF THE QUESTION
AND AS THEY DID NOT REQUIRE THE WHOLE OF THE HOUSE FOR THEIR ACCOMMODATION THE THIRD STORY WAS UNOCCUPIED EXCEPT BY THE GHOSTLY IDEA OF A LADY WHOSE RUSTLING SILK GOWN WAS SOMETIMES HEARD BY THE LISTENERS AT THE FOOT OF THE SECOND FLIGHT OF STAIRS
FEW GIRLS WOULD HAVE DONE AS YOU HAVE DONE--WOULD HAVE BEHELD THE GLARE AND GLITTER AND DAZZLING DISPLAY OF LONDON WITH DISPOSITIONS SO UNCHANGED HEART SO UNCONTAMINATED
BUT I COULD PERCEIVE HE CAUGHT GLADLY AT THE IDEA OF DEFERRING THE OPERATION A FEW MONTHS LONGER
MARY'S ACCOUNT OF THEIR JOURNEY IS THUS GIVEN
THE FEW PRIVATE LESSONS THAT M
BUT OF THIS THEY WERE UNAWARE AT THE TIME AS SHE HAD DECLINED THEIR PRESENCE AND NEVER MADE ANY COMPLAINT
IT IS TOO GREAT A TREASURE TO BE EVER WANTONLY THROWN AWAY WHEN ONCE SECURED MISS BRONTE HAD NOT BEEN MANY WEEKS IN HER NEW SITUATION BEFORE SHE HAD A PROOF OF THE KIND-HEARTED HOSPITALITY OF HER EMPLOYERS
AND I FEEL NOW THAT IT WOULD BE TOO SELFISH TO LEAVE HIM AT LEAST AS LONG AS BRANWELL AND ANNE ARE ABSENT IN ORDER TO PURSUE SELFISH INTERESTS OF MY OWN
IS DEAD
CHARLOTTE ALWAYS REMEMBERED HER WITH AFFECTION AND GRATITUDE
THEY OWED DEBTS WHICH THEY COULD NEVER PAY
FROM TWO TO FOUR LESSONS AGAIN
EMILY AND ANNE WERE GOING TO KEIGHLEY TO MEET ME
REASON TELLS ME SO AND I AM NOT SO UTTERLY THE SLAVE OF FEELING BUT THAT I CAN OCCASIONALLY HEAR HER VOICE JUNE 2ND 1840
ERGO ACCORDING TO MY MANNER OF ARGUING THE AMUSEMENT IS AT SUCH TIMES PERFECTLY INNOCENT ALTHOUGH THE DISTANCE BETWEEN HAWORTH AND B WAS BUT SEVENTEEN MILES IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GO STRAIGHT FROM THE ONE TO THE OTHER WITHOUT HIRING A GIG OR VEHICLE OF SOME KIND FOR THE JOURNEY
I NEVER HEARD HER SPEAK OF THE PLACE BUT ONCE AND THAT WAS ON THE SECOND DAY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER
A SHORT POEM
5 THE CONQUEROR IN THE GAME WAS ROI DES ARBALETRIERS FOR THE COMING YEAR AND RECEIVED A JEWELLED DECORATION ACCORDINGLY WHICH HE WAS ENTITLED TO WEAR FOR TWELVE MONTHS
CORAGGIO HER TEMPORARY ENGAGEMENT IN THIS UNCONGENIAL FAMILY ENDED IN THE JULY OF THIS YEAR
IN FACT NOTHING CAN BE MORE OPPOSED THAN THE STATE OF SOCIETY THE MODES OF THINKING THE STANDARDS OF REFERENCE ON ALL POINTS OF MORALITY MANNERS AND EVEN POLITICS AND RELIGION IN SUCH A NEW MANUFACTURING PLACE AS KEIGHLEY IN THE NORTH AND ANY STATELY SLEEPY PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL TOWN IN THE SOUTH
CHARLOTTE SAYS IN WRITING TO E JUST AFTER HER RETURN HOME--"WERE I TO TELL YOU OF THE IMPRESSION YOU HAVE MADE ON EVERY ONE HERE YOU WOULD ACCUSE ME OF FLATTERY
OATMEAL PORRIDGE FOR BREAKFAST
AT THIS MOMENT A RAY FROM THE MOON PENETRATED SOME APERTURE IN THE BLIND
PROBABLY IT WAS FOUND ON INQUIRY THAT THE EXPENSES OF SUCH A LIFE WERE GREATER THAN HIS FATHER'S SLENDER FINANCES COULD AFFORD EVEN WITH THE HELP WHICH CHARLOTTE'S LABOURS AT MISS W---'S GAVE BY PROVIDING FOR ANNE'S BOARD AND EDUCATION
A MAN THAT SHE KNEW WHO WAS A SMALL MANUFACTURER HAD ENGAGED IN MANY LOCAL SPECULATIONS WHICH HAD ALWAYS TURNED OUT WELL AND THEREBY RENDERED HIM A PERSON OF SOME WEALTH
TO SMALL INFANTINE GAIETIES THEY WERE UNACCUSTOMED
FOR EVERY APPEARANCE OF FEELING OF JOY SORROW FRIENDLINESS ANTIPATHY ADMIRATION DISGUST ARE ALIKE CONSTRUED BY THE WORLD INTO THE ATTEMPT TO HOOK A HUSBAND
BUT THAT HE CONSIDERED THE LETTER REMARKABLE MAY I THINK BE INFERRED BOTH FROM ITS PRESERVATION AND ITS RECURRENCE TO HIS MEMORY WHEN THE REAL NAME OF CURRER BELL WAS MADE KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC
A LETTER CONTAINING SUCH A GRACEFUL APPRECIATION OF THE DAUGHTERS CHARACTERS UNDER THE FORM OF A TRIBUTE OF RESPECT TO THEIR FATHER THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO COPY IT EVEN HAD THERE NOT ALSO BEEN A PROPOSAL MADE IN IT RESPECTING CHARLOTTE WHICH DESERVES A PLACE IN THE RECORD OF HER LIFE
MARTHA THE GIRL THEY HAD TO ASSIST POOR OLD TABBY AND WHO REMAINS STILL THE FAITHFUL SERVANT AT THE PARSONAGE IS ILL WITH A SWELLING IN HER KNEE AND OBLIGED TO GO HOME
CHAPTER III THE REV
OF THIS SPACE TWENTY YARDS OR SO IN DEPTH ARE OCCUPIED BY THE GRASSY GARDEN WHICH IS SCARCELY WIDER THAN THE HOUSE
WHAT IS HER NAME SUSAN BLAND THE DAUGHTER OF JOHN BLAND THE SUPERINTENDENT NOW SUSAN BLAND IS MY OLDEST AND BEST SCHOLAR IN THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL
THESE ARE NOT THE FIRST SISTERS WHO HAVE LAID THEIR LIVES AS A SACRIFICE BEFORE THEIR BROTHER'S IDOLIZED WISH
AND IF EMILY COULD SHARE THEM WITH ME WE COULD TAKE A FOOTING IN THE WORLD AFTERWARDS WHICH WE CAN NEVER DO NOW
ALSO OF MARIA THEIR DAUGHTER WHO DIED MAY 6TH 1825 IN THE 12TH YEAR OF HER AGE
PIERRE DONC CHERCHA D'ABORD AVIDEMENT LA GLOIRE QUI SE FLETRIT ET LES PLAISIRS QUI TROMPENT MAIS IL FIT BIENTOT LA DECOUVERTE BIENTOT IL S'APERCUT QUE CE QU'IL POURSUIVAIT N'ETAIT QE'UNE ILLUSION A LAQUELLE IL NE POURRAIT JAMAIS ATTEINDRE
AND THE SAVINGS SHE HAD ACCUMULATED DURING MANY YEARS SERVICE FORMED A COMPETENCY FOR ONE IN HER RANK OF LIFE
SHE MADE HER NIECES SEW WITH PURPOSE OR WITHOUT AND AS FAR AS POSSIBLE DISCOURAGED ANY OTHER CULTURE
IN PROCURING IT HE SHOWED ALL THE CUNNING OF THE OPIUM-EATER
EVEN WHEN I WAS A BOY I REMEMBER A HOUSE IN THE BEST STREET OF PENZANCE WHICH WAS UNINHABITED BECAUSE IT WAS BELIEVED TO BE HAUNTED AND WHICH YOUNG PEOPLE WALKED BY AT NIGHT AT A QUICKENED PACE AND WITH A BEATING HEART
THE PAYMENT MADE BY THE PARENTS WAS BARELY ENOUGH FOR FOOD AND LODGING
WHEN PUMP AGAIN LADS WAS THE ORDER
YET THE ASPECT OF KEIGHLEY PROMISES WELL FOR FUTURE STATELINESS IF NOT PICTURESQUENESS
IT IS EVIDENT TO THE STRANGER THAT AS THE GABLE-ENDED HOUSES WHICH OBTRUDE THEMSELVES CORNER-WISE ON THE WIDENING STREET FALL VACANT THEY ARE PULLED DOWN TO ALLOW OF GREATER SPACE FOR TRAFFIC AND A MORE MODERN STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE
I HEAR THAT HE GOT A SOVEREIGN WHILE I HAVE BEEN AWAY UNDER PRETENCE OF PAYING A PRESSING DEBT
THEY TOLD ME WHEN I FIRST RETURNED THAT I WAS TO CONSIDER THEIR SITTING ROOM MY SITTING-ROOM ALSO AND TO GO THERE WHENEVER I WAS NOT ENGAGED IN THE SCHOOLROOM
SHE WAS A HUNGRY GOOD-NATURED ORDINARY GIRL OLDER THAN CHARLOTTE AND EVER READY TO PROTECT HER FROM ANY PETTY TYRANNY OR ENCROACHMENTS ON THE PART OF THE ELDER GIRLS
AND WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH A RESPECTABLE NOT BY ANY MEANS A SHOWY SCHOOL AND TO COMMENCE HOUSEKEEPING WITH A CAPITAL OF ONLY THAT AMOUNT
I WOULD URGE YOUR VISIT YET--I WOULD ENTREAT AND PRESS IT--BUT THE THOUGHT COMES ACROSS ME SHOULD TABBY DIE WHILE YOU ARE IN THE HOUSE I SHOULD NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF
TO ATTEND MASS SEDULOUSLY FOR A TIME
SHE LOOKED A LITTLE STOUT VIVACIOUS LADY VERY PLAINLY DRESSED NOT MUCH DIGNITY OR PRETENSION ABOUT HER
YOU MUST WRITE TO ME
WHEN I THOUGHT OF YOU IN THAT BUSY INTERVAL IT WAS TO RESOLVE THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ALL WHEN MY WAY WAS CLEAR AND MY GRAND END ATTAINED
AND AGAIN OF THE TWO SISTERS THE IDEA OF THE LITTLE GENTLE YOUNGEST SUFFERING IN LONELY PATIENCE WAS INSUPPORTABLE TO HER
ON MARCH 6TH 1843 SHE WRITES THUS I AM SETTLED BY THIS TIME OF COURSE
SHE USED VERY INCONSISTENTLY TO RAIL AT MONEY AND MONEY-GETTING AND THEN WISH SHE WAS ABLE TO VISIT ALL THE LARGE TOWNS IN EUROPE SEE ALL THE SIGHTS AND KNOW ALL THE CELEBRITIES
SINCE THE EVENT WE HAVE BEEN ALMOST WITHOUT ASSISTANCE--A PERSON HAS DROPPED IN NOW AND THEN TO DO THE DRUDGERY BUT WE HAVE AS YET BEEN ABLE TO PROCURE NO REGULAR SERVANT
AT EIGHT THERE WAS A SLIGHT MEAL OF WATER AND PISTOLETS THE DELICIOUS LITTLE BRUSSELS ROLLS WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY PRAYERS AND THEN TO BED
A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO AND THE DRIVER RELAXES HIS CARE AND THE HORSE BREATHES MORE EASILY AS THEY PASS INTO THE QUITE LITTLE BY STREET THAT LEADS TO HAWORTH PARSONAGE
AND BEING ADMITTED WERE REQUIRED TO SWEAR A SOLEMN OATH THAT NO OTHER PASTIME OR EXERCISE SHOULD TAKE UP ANY PART OF THEIR LEISURE THE WHOLE OF WHICH WAS TO BE DEVOTED TO THE PRACTICE OF THE NOBLE ART OF SHOOTING WITH THE CROSS-BOW

NUMBERS OF ILL-PAID CLERGYMEN HAILED THE PROSPECT WITH JOY AND EAGERLY PUT DOWN THE NAMES OF THEIR CHILDREN AS PUPILS WHEN THE ESTABLISHMENT SHOULD BE READY TO RECEIVE THEM
THIS MADE IT INEVITABLE THAT--LATER ON IN HER TOO SHORT CAREER--THE INTENSITY OF HER FEELING SHOULD WEAR OUT HER PHYSICAL HEALTH
AYLOTT AND JONES
IL SE FIT MARBRE ET FER POUR EXECUTER SES GRANDS PROJETS
THIS IS A SPECIMEN OF THE STRONG CHARACTER NOT SELDOM MANIFESTED BY THE YORKSHIRE CLERGY OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH
IN HIS EXTREME OLD AGE A RUBRIC MEETING WAS HELD AT WHICH HIS CLERICAL BRETHREN GLADLY SUBSCRIBED TO PRESENT HIM WITH A TESTIMONIAL OF THEIR DEEP RESPECT AND REGARD
SHE ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH OF HARD PRACTICALITY AND USEFUL KNOWLEDGE FORCED ON US BY NECESSITY AND THAT THE THING MOST NEEDED WAS TO SOFTEN AND REFINE OUR MINDS
WHEN ABSOLUTE BUSINESS WAS THE ONLY REASON FOR STIRRING BEYOND THE PRECINCTS OF HOME AND WHEN THAT BUSINESS WAS CONDUCTED UNDER A PRESSURE OF DIFFICULTIES WHICH THEY THEMSELVES BORNE ALONG TO BRADFORD MARKET IN A SWIFT FIRST-CLASS CARRIAGE CAN HARDLY BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
HER LOVE WAS POURED OUT ON ANNE AS CHARLOTTE'S WAS ON HER
SIR WALTER SCOTT'S WRITINGS WORDSWORTH'S AND SOUTHEY'S POEMS WERE AMONG THE LIGHTER LITERATURE
BUT THEIR FATHER FROM WHOM THEY DERIVED NOT A LITTLE OF THEIR ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT WAS SILENTLY COGNISANT OF MUCH OF WHICH SHE TOOK NO NOTE
I CANNOT BEND MY LIFE TO THE GRAND END OF DOING GOOD
AND HE DETERMINED TO PUT AN END TO THIS CUSTOM
AND ANY ONE PASSING BY THE KITCHEN-DOOR MIGHT HAVE SEEN HER STUDYING GERMAN OUT OF AN OPEN BOOK PROPPED UP BEFORE HER AS SHE KNEADED THE DOUGH
THE WHOLE FAMILY USED TO MAKE OUT HISTORIES AND INVENT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
I HOPE WITH YOU THAT THE PRESENT DELIGHTFUL WEATHER MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PERFECT RESTORATION OF OUR DEAR PAPA'S HEALTH
PAPA TOOK THE CHAIR AND MR C
HE WAS TOLD THAT TOWARDS HIMSELF THEY HAD NO PERSONAL OBJECTION
PIERRE A PROMIS
MEANTIME A PLAN HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AND APPROVED BY MR AND MRS
I CALL PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING LETTER OF CHARLOTTE'S DATED JULY 10TH 1846
KEIGHLEY IS IN PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION FROM A POPULOUS OLD-FASHIONED VILLAGE INTO A STILL MORE POPULOUS AND FLOURISHING TOWN
MARY AND HER SISTER THE BRIGHT DANCING LAUGHING MARTHA WERE PARLOUR-BOARDERS IN AN ESTABLISHMENT JUST BEYOND THE BARRIERS OF BRUSSELS
A LOAN HOWEVER SHE HAS OFFERED OR RATHER INTIMATES THAT SHE PERHAPS WILL OFFER IN CASE PUPILS CAN BE SECURED AN ELIGIBLE SITUATION OBTAINED C
SHE DID NOT LIKE HIM SHE SAID
THE BAND OF SINGERS WHO PERFORMED THIS CEREMONY EXPECTED TO HAVE MONEY GIVEN THEM AND OFTEN PASSED THE FOLLOWING NIGHT IN DRINKING
SHE WOULD HAVE ENTERED INTO AN ARGUMENT ON THE SUBJECT BUT FOR THIS M
MAIS ALORS L'ARBRE SECULAIRE INEBRANLABLE COMME LE ROC OU IL A SA BASE BRAVE ET LA FAUX DU TEMPS ET L'EFFORT DES VENTS ET DES TEMPETES
AND FROM AN EXCITEMENT NOT UNNATURAL IN A GIRL WHO HAS WORKED HERSELF UP TO THE PITCH OF WRITING TO A POET LAUREATE AND ASKING HIS OPINION OF HER POEMS SHE USED SOME HIGH-FLOWN EXPRESSIONS WHICH PROBABLY GAVE HIM THE IDEA THAT SHE WAS A ROMANTIC YOUNG LADY UNACQUAINTED WITH THE REALITIES OF LIFE
CONCEITED DOGMATICAL HYPOCRITICAL LITTLE HUMBUG I SHOULD THINK WOULD BE THE MILDEST
REGRETTED THAT HER CHILDREN WERE ALREADY AT SCHOOL AT LIVERPOOL
NEITHER SHE NOR WE HAD ANY IDEA BUT THAT OUR OPINIONS WERE THE OPINIONS OF ALL THE SENSIBLE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND WE USED TO ASTONISH EACH OTHER AT EVERY SENTENCE CHARLOTTE AT SCHOOL HAD NO PLAN OF LIFE BEYOND WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES MADE FOR HER
THE WORDS IN ITALICS ARE CHARLOTTE'S FOR WHICH HE SUBSTITUTES A BETTER FORM OF EXPRESSION WHICH IS PLACED BETWEEN BRACKETS
NO DOUBT THERE ARE DEFECTS IN HIS CHARACTER BUT THERE ARE ALSO GOOD QUALITIES GOD BLESS HIM
IT SEEMS GRIEVOUS INDEED THAT THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SINNED SHOULD SUFFER SO LARGELY IN FACT ALL THEIR LATTER DAYS BLIGHTED WITH THE PRESENCE OF CRUEL SHAMEFUL SUFFERING,--THE PREMATURE DEATHS OF TWO AT LEAST OF THE SISTERS,--ALL THE GREAT POSSIBILITIES OF THEIR EARTHLY LIVES SNAPPED SHORT,--MAY BE DATED FROM MIDSUMMER 1845
ALSO OF PATRICK BRANWELL THEIR SON WHO DIED SEPT
SHE REMEMBERED THE TIMES WHEN WATCHERS OR WAKENERS IN THE NIGHT HEARD THE DISTANT WORD OF COMMAND AND THE MEASURED TRAMP OF THOUSANDS OF SAD DESPERATE MEN RECEIVING A SURREPTITIOUS MILITARY TRAINING IN PREPARATION FOR SOME GREAT DAY WHICH THEY SAW IN THEIR VISIONS WHEN RIGHT SHOULD STRUGGLE WITH MIGHT AND COME OFF VICTORIOUS
AND FROM AN EXPRESSION IN ONE OF HER SUBSEQUENT LETTERS THEY ALL I BELIEVE STAYED AT THE CHAPTER COFFEE HOUSE PATERNOSTER ROW--A STRANGE OLD-FASHIONED TAVERN OF WHICH I SHALL HAVE MORE TO SAY HEREAFTER
WHEN MY THOUGHTS TURN TO HER THEY ALWAYS SEE HER AS A PATIENT PERSECUTED STRANGER
THUS ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NEVER ANY EXPLANATION OF MADAME HEGER'S CHANGE OF MANNER THIS MAY BE GIVEN AS ONE GREAT REASON WHY ABOUT THIS TIME CHARLOTTE WAS MADE PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF A SILENT ESTRANGEMENT BETWEEN THEM
LITERATURE CANNOT BE THE BUSINESS OF A WOMAN'S LIFE AND IT OUGHT NOT TO BE
AT HOME YOU KNOW I TALK WITH EASE AND AM NEVER SHY--NEVER WEIGHED DOWN AND OPPRESSED BY THAT MISERABLE MAUVAISE HONTE WHICH TORMENTS AND CONSTRAINS ME ELSEWHERE
I SHOULD LIKE HOWEVER PREVIOUSLY TO HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE PROBABLE COST
MR TIGHE RECTOR OF DRUMGOOLAND PARISH
I SHOULD LIKE EVEN TO BE CUTTING UP THE HASH WITH THE CLERK AND SOME REGISTER PEOPLE AT THE OTHER TABLE AND YOU STANDING BY WATCHING THAT I PUT ENOUGH FLOUR NOT TOO MUCH PEPPER AND ABOVE ALL THAT I SAVE THE BEST PIECES OF THE LEG OF MUTTON FOR TIGER AND KEEPER THE FIRST OF WHICH PERSONAGES WOULD BE JUMPING ABOUT THE DISH AND CARVING-KNIFE AND THE LATTER STANDING LIKE A DEVOURING FLAME ON THE KITCHEN-FLOOR
MISS BRANWELL WAS I BELIEVE A KINDLY AND CONSCIENTIOUS WOMAN WITH A GOOD DEAL OF CHARACTER BUT WITH THE SOMEWHAT NARROW IDEAS NATURAL TO ONE WHO HAD SPENT NEARLY ALL HER LIFE IN THE SAME PLACE
THE GREAT SALOON WAS ALSO USED FOR THE COURT BALLS AND FESTIVALS WHEN THE ARCHERS WERE NOT ADMITTED
APRES DES JOURNEES ABSORBEES TOUT ENTIERES PAR LES DEVOIRS QUE SA PLACE LUI IMPOSE IL REUNIT LES PAUVRES LES OUVRIERS LEUR DONNE DES COURS GRATUITS ET TROUVE ENCORE LE MOYEN DE LES AMUSER EN LES INSTRUISANT
SHE LOOKED A LITTLE OLD WOMAN SO SHORT-SIGHTED THAT SHE ALWAYS APPEARED TO BE SEEKING SOMETHING AND MOVING HER HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE TO CATCH A SIGHT OF IT
FOR TWO MILES THE ROAD PASSES OVER TOLERABLY LEVEL GROUND DISTANT HILLS ON THE LEFT A BECK FLOWING THROUGH MEADOWS ON THE RIGHT AND FURNISHING WATER POWER AT CERTAIN POINTS TO THE FACTORIES BUILT ON ITS BANKS
AND THAT THERE WERE GRAND AND FINE QUALITIES IN MR WILSON I HAVE RECEIVED ABUNDANT EVIDENCE
OR HE FINDS IF MORE SHREWD AND ADVENTUROUS THAT THE BECK RUNNING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE OR THE MINERALS BENEATH HIS FEET CAN BE TURNED INTO A NEW SOURCE OF WEALTH
IT IS FROM THE HUSBAND OF MISS TEMPLE SHE DIED IN 1856 BUT HE A CLERGYMAN THUS WROTE IN REPLY TO A LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM ON THE SUBJECT BY ONE OF MR WILSON'S FRIENDS:--"OFTEN HAVE I HEARD MY LATE DEAR WIFE SPEAK OF HER SOJOURN AT COWAN BRIDGE
AND ALTOGETHER EVINCING AN IRRITABILITY OF DISPOSITION BORDERING ON INSANITY
BUT THE CLEANLINESS OF THE PARSONAGE ARRANGEMENTS WAS PERFECT
THE TIME REFERRED TO IS HER FIRST APPEARANCE AT ROE HEAD ON JANUARY 19TH 1831
CARRIED PERHAPS TO AN UNNECESSARY EXTENT AND LEADING OCCASIONALLY TO A MEDDLING WITH LITTLE MATTERS WHICH HAD SOMETIMES THE EFFECT OF PRODUCING IRRITATION OF FEELING
AND THOUGH HIS DEPRESSION WAS THE RESULT OF HIS FAULTS IT WAS IN NO OTHER RESPECT DIFFERENT FROM HERS
YOUR KIND INTERESTING AND MOST WELCOME EPISTLE SHOWED ME HOWEVER THAT I HAD BEEN BOTH MISTAKEN AND UNCHARITABLE IN THESE SUPPOSITIONS
FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT SPEAK SO
THE PROPOSAL IS KIND AND IN A GREAT SELFISH CITY LIKE BRUSSELS AND A GREAT SELFISH SCHOOL CONTAINING NEARLY NINETY PUPILS BOARDERS AND DAY PUPILS INCLUDED IMPLIES A DEGREE OF INTEREST WHICH DEMANDS GRATITUDE IN RETURN
HAD BUT THE MORAL QUALITIES HE MIGHT TURN OUT A GREAT PAINTER
THE BEST OF IT IS THEY GIVE ONE A THOROUGH IDEA OF FRANCE AND PARIS AND ARE THE BEST SUBSTITUTE FOR FRENCH CONVERSATION THAT I HAVE MET WITH
ALSO OF CHARLOTTE THEIR DAUGHTER WIFE OF THE REV
INDEED AS DR WHITAKER SAYS THE PEOPLE OF THIS DISTRICT ARE STRONG RELIGIONISTS ONLY FIFTY YEARS AGO THEIR RELIGION DID NOT WORK DOWN INTO THEIR LIVES
5 SCOTT DESCRIBES THE SPORT SHOOTING AT THE POPINJAY AS AN ANCIENT GAME FORMERLY PRACTISED WITH ARCHERY BUT AT THIS PERIOD 1679 WITH FIREARMS
FOR I READ THEM IN CHILDHOOD AND CHILDHOOD HAS A VERY STRONG FACULTY OF ADMIRATION BUT A VERY WEAK ONE OF CRITICISM I AM PLEASED THAT YOU CANNOT QUITE DECIDE WHETHER I AM AN ATTORNEY'S CLERK OR A NOVEL READING DRESS-MAKER
TO NEW ZEALAND ON HEARING SOME EXAGGERATED ACCOUNTS OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND TOLD ME SHE HOPED IT WOULD COME IN SEASONABLY
THE YOUNG MEN'S MAGAZINES IN SIX NUMBERS FROM AUGUST TO DECEMBER THE LATTER MONTHS DOUBLE NUMBER COMPLETED DECEMBER THE 12TH 1829
EVEN IN ALL THE HASTE OF THEIR SUDDEN DEPARTURE FROM BRUSSELS M
CAME TO STAY WITH HER AT HAWORTH SO THERE WAS ONE HAPPY TIME SECURED
HIS WORDS HIS VERSES CAME MORE FREQUENTLY TO HER MEMORY I IMAGINE THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER POET
YOU WILL HARDLY BELIEVE THAT MADAME HEGER GOOD AND KIND AS I HAVE DESCRIBED HER NEVER COMES NEAR ME ON THESE OCCASIONS
BUT THIS WAS COMPARATIVELY SELDOM
EMILY ACCOMPANIED HER AS A PUPIL
HE MADE AN EARLY MARRIAGE AND REARED AND EDUCATED TEN CHILDREN ON THE PROCEEDS OF THE FEW ACRES OF LAND WHICH HE FARMED
I BEG TO THANK YOU IN THE NAME OF C E AND A
YOU WERE NEVER UNKIND YET
SHE TOLD US A TALE OUT OF IT
THE INN AND CHURCH APPEARED TO BE IN NATURAL CONNECTION AND AS THE LABOURS OF THE TEMPERANCE SOCIETY HAD THEN TO BEGIN THE INTERESTS OF SOBRIETY WERE NOT ALWAYS CONSULTED
BUT THE DIFFICULTY OFTEN WAS TO PERSUADE HER TO AVAIL HERSELF OF THE INVITATIONS WHICH CAME URGING HER TO SPEND SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WITH E AND MARY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES THAT LAY WITHIN THE DISTANCE OF A WALK
AND ACCORDING TO THE UNFORTUNATE HABIT OF THE PLACE THE BRILLIANT PATRICK WAS SENT FOR TO THE INN TO BEGUILE THE EVENING BY HIS INTELLECTUAL CONVERSATION AND HIS FLASHES OF WIT
IF YOU COULD SEE AND HEAR THE EFFORTS I MAKE TO TEACH THEM TO PRONOUNCE LIKE ENGLISHMEN AND THEIR UNAVAILING ATTEMPTS TO IMITATE YOU WOULD LAUGH TO ALL ETERNITY
THE ORDEAL I REFLECTED WOULD NOT LAST MANY WEEKS AND I TRUSTED IT WOULD DO ME GOOD
BUT WHEN I STOOP DOWN TO DRINK OF THE PURE WATERS THEY FLY FROM MY LIPS AS IF I WERE TANTALUS
I EXCITED AUNT'S WRATH VERY MUCH BY BURNING THE CLOTHES THE FIRST TIME I ATTEMPTED TO IRON
THEY ARE NOT IN THE VOLUME OF POEMS WHICH THE SISTERS PUBLISHED
BUT NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN TELL HOW HARD A GOVERNESS'S WORK IS TO ME--FOR NO ONE BUT MYSELF IS AWARE HOW UTTERLY AVERSE MY WHOLE MIND AND NATURE ARE FOR THE EMPLOYMENT
POOR CHILD
THEY WERE VERY FASHIONABLY DRESSED AND BEGAN CRITICISING THE ROOM C
FORMERLY YOU DID NOT CARE GREATLY ABOUT IT
I KNOW IF YOU CONSENT IT SHALL NOT BE MY FAULT IF YOU EVER REPENT YOUR KINDNESS THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN FROM THE HOUSE IN WHICH SHE WAS RESIDING AS GOVERNESS
STRENGTH COURAGE AND EXPERIENCE ARE THEIR INVARIABLE RESULTS
IL EST UN DES MEMBRES LES PLUS ZELES DE CETTE SOCIETE DE S
HE PLACED THEM AT MADAME HEGER'S SCHOOL IN JULY 1842 NOT A MONTH BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE GRANDES VACANCES ON AUGUST 15TH
THE NECESSARIES OF FOOD AND CLOTHING ARE MUCH MORE EASILY SUPPLIED THAN THE ALMOST EQUAL NECESSARIES OF ATTENDANCE CARE SOOTHING AMUSEMENT AND SYMPATHY
AND FROM THESE CONFLICTING CHARACTERS HE WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO SIFT AND COLLECT THE ELEMENTS OF TRUTH AND TRY TO UNITE THEM INTO A PERFECT WHOLE
TO HIM AND TO OTHERS MANY INDUCEMENTS HAVE BEEN OFFERED TO MIGRATE
SCENE ON THE GREAT BRIDGE
I CONSENTED
AND NOW IF POSSIBLE THE CLOUDS ARE GATHERING DARKER AND A MORE OPPRESSIVE DESPONDENCY WEIGHS ON MY SPIRITS
IT IS OUR POLAR STAR AND WE LOOK TO IT IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES OF DESPONDENCY
AND SO THERE IS A TESTIMONY TO WHAT I HAVE SAID OF THE TRADITIONAL FEELING OF THE DISTRICT IN THE FACT THAT THE OLD TESTAMENT NAMES IN GENERAL USE AMONG THE PURITANS ARE YET THE PREVALENT APPELLATIONS IN MOST YORKSHIRE FAMILIES OF MIDDLE OR HUMBLE RANK WHATEVER THEIR RELIGIOUS PERSUASION MAY BE
AT MANY A MEAL THE LITTLE BRONTES WENT WITHOUT FOOD ALTHOUGH CRAVING WITH HUNGER
BESIDES THIS THEY HAD TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN EDIFICE C C
THE SWISS ARTISTS CONTINUED
SHE HAS KEPT IN A CONTINUAL FLOW OF GOOD HUMOUR DURING HER STAY HERE AND HAS CONSEQUENTLY BEEN VERY FASCINATING THEY ARE MAKING SUCH A NOISE ABOUT ME I CANNOT WRITE ANY MORE
I USED TO THINK THEM SPIRITLESS THEY WERE SO DIFFERENT TO ANY CHILDREN I HAD EVER SEEN
ALSO OF ELIZABETH THEIR DAUGHTER WHO DIED JUNE 15TH 1825 IN THE 11TH YEAR OF HER AGE
THE POWERS I POSSESS MUST BE EXERCISED TO A DEFINITE END AND AS I DON'T KNOW THEM MYSELF I MUST ASK OF OTHERS WHAT THEY ARE WORTH
AT HIS OWN COST HE BUILT A HANDSOME CHURCH AT LIVERSEDGE ON A HILL OPPOSITE THE ONE ON WHICH HIS HOUSE STOOD WHICH WAS THE FIRST ATTEMPT IN THE WEST RIDING TO MEET THE WANTS OF THE OVERGROWN POPULATION AND MADE MANY PERSONAL SACRIFICES FOR HIS OPINIONS BOTH RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL WHICH WERE OF THE TRUE OLD FASHIONED TORY STAMP
A SOUR AND STURDY HUMOUR IS THE CONSEQUENCE SO THAT A STRANGER IS SHOCKED BY A TONE OF DEFIANCE IN EVERY VOICE AND AN AIR OF FIERCENESS IN EVERY COUNTENANCE EVEN NOW A STRANGER CAN HARDLY ASK A QUESTION WITHOUT RECEIVING SOME CRUSTY REPLY IF INDEED HE RECEIVE ANY AT ALL
OF COURSE WE ARE ALL EXCEEDINGLY DISTRESSED AT THE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR SHE WAS LIKE ONE OF OUR OWN FAMILY
ACTING ON THE CONVICTION WHICH I HAVE ALL ALONG ENTERTAINED THAT WHERE CHARLOTTE BRONTE'S OWN WORDS COULD BE USED NO OTHERS OUGHT TO TAKE THEIR PLACE I SHALL MAKE EXTRACTS FROM THIS SERIES ACCORDING TO THEIR DATES
SHE WAS SENT HOME IN CHARGE OF A CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
TWELVE TRUSTEES WERE APPOINTED
WE ARE NOT AT ALL
AND THE FEW MAGISTRATES LEFT TO THEMSELVES AND GENERALLY RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER WERE MOST OF THEM INCLINED TO TOLERATE ECCENTRICITY AND TO WINK AT FAULTS TOO MUCH LIKE THEIR OWN
AND THE WORKING OF IT WAS FOR MANY YEARS THE GREAT OBJECT AND INTEREST OF HIS LIFE
IN MY SECRET SOUL I BELIEVE THERE IS NO CAUSE TO REGRET IT
AFTER THE RECORD OF ANNE'S DEATH THERE IS ROOM FOR NO OTHER
SHE HAD A YORKSHIRE KEENNESS OF PERCEPTION INTO CHARACTER AND IT WAS NOT EVERYBODY SHE LIKED
THE LAWYER THE DOCTOR AND THE CLERGYMAN LIVE AT HAND AND HARDLY IN THE SUBURBS WITH A SCREEN OF SHRUBS FOR CONCEALMENT
SOMETIMES I SUCCEED TEMPORARILY BUT NO CONSOLATION CAN RESTORE HIS SIGHT OR ATONE FOR THE WANT OF IT
I SHOULD HAVE CERTAINLY THOUGHT YOU SCRUPULOUS OVER-MUCH AND WONDERED HOW YOU COULD POSSIBLY REGRET BEING CIVIL TO A DECENT INDIVIDUAL MERELY BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO BE SINGLE INSTEAD OF DOUBLE
THERE IS THE PARK OF KIRKLEES FULL OF SUNNY GLADES SPECKLED WITH BLACK SHADOWS OF IMMEMORIAL YEW-TREES
THE NOSE TOO IS GOOD
BUT IN EARLY YOUTH HIS POWER OF ATTRACTING AND ATTACHING PEOPLE WAS SO GREAT THAT FEW CAME IN CONTACT WITH HIM WHO WERE NOT SO MUCH DAZZLED BY HIM AS TO BE DESIROUS OF GRATIFYING WHATEVER WISHES HE EXPRESSED
THOUGH HER SILENCE SOMETIMES LEFT ONE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE AGREED WHEN SHE DID NOT SHE NEVER GAVE A FLATTERING OPINION AND THUS HER WORDS WERE GOLDEN WHETHER FOR PRAISE OR BLAME MARY'S FATHER WAS A MAN OF REMARKABLE INTELLIGENCE BUT OF STRONG NOT TO SAY VIOLENT PREJUDICES ALL RUNNING IN FAVOUR OF REPUBLICANISM AND DISSENT
I GET ON HERE AFTER A FASHION
I MUST SUPPRESS WHAT I FEEL OR YOU WILL THINK ME FOOLISHLY ENTHUSIASTIC
TO MY ASTONISHMENT I WAS TAKEN TO TASK ON THE SUBJECT BY MRS
ONE WAS WHEN SOMETIME IN THE EVENING LIGHT SHE HAD BEEN PLAYING WITH HER LITTLE BOY PATRICK BRANWELL IN THE PARLOUR OF HAWORTH PARSONAGE
THE GIRLS THEMSELVES LOVED EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH IT--ALL DESCRIPTIONS OR ENGRAVINGS OF GREAT PICTURES
BUT ALTOGETHER THE ELEGANCE AND COMPOSURE OF STYLE ARE SUCH AS ONE WOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED FROM THIS VEHEMENT AND ILL-FATED YOUNG MAN
I OWN I WAS ASTONISHED THE FIRST TIME I WAS LEFT ALONE THUS
THE WRITER SAYS,--"HAVING BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THE RESPECTFUL MANNERS OF THE LOWER ORDERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS I WAS AT FIRST MUCH DISGUSTED AND SOMEWHAT ALARMED AT THE GREAT FREEDOM DISPLAYED BY THE WORKING CLASSES OF HECKMONDWIKE AND GOMERSALL TO THOSE IN A STATION ABOVE THEM
YET SHE AND THE SERVANTS ALWAYS LIVED ON GOOD TERMS WITH EACH OTHER THESE SERVANTS ARE YET ALIVE
SHE COULD NOT AS WHILE SHE WAS AT MISS W---'S FEEL AMIDST THE OCCUPATIONS OF THE DAY THAT WHEN EVENING CAME SHE MIGHT EMPLOY HERSELF IN MORE CONGENIAL WAYS
AND NOW LIFE'S FITFUL FEVER IS OVER WITH HER AND SHE SLEEPS WELL I SHALL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN
SHE IS RESIDING WITH HER SISTER IN A LITTLE HOUSE OF HER OWN WHICH SHE BOUGHT WITH HER SAVINGS A YEAR OR TWO SINCE
ENTRANCE FOR CLOTHES
F
BUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME I FANCY IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER IT WILL EVER ASSUME A MORE SOLID SHAPE
REVENGE WAS HANDED DOWN FROM FATHER TO SON AS AN HEREDITARY DUTY
I HAVE BEFORE ALLUDED TO INTELLIGENCE FROM HOME CALCULATED TO DISTRESS CHARLOTTE EXCEEDINGLY WITH FEARS RESPECTING BRANWELL WHICH I SHALL SPEAK OF MORE AT LARGE WHEN THE REALISATION OF HER WORST APPREHENSIONS CAME TO AFFECT THE DAILY LIFE OF HERSELF AND HER SISTERS
IF NOT AT THEIR OWN RISK ON THE AUTHOR'S ACCOUNT
AND AFTER THE SCHOOL WAS REMOVED TO CASTERTON IT WAS USED FOR A BOBBIN-MILL CONNECTED WITH THE STREAM WHERE WOODEN REELS WERE MADE OUT OF THE ALDERS WHICH GROW PROFUSELY IN SUCH GROUND AS THAT SURROUNDING COWAN BRIDGE
I WAS STRUCK WITH MARY'S EXPRESSION OF A SIMILAR FEELING AT FIRST SIGHT
HE THEREFORE RETIRED WITH THE DECLARATION THAT IF HE COULD NOT COME WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE PARISH HIS MINISTRY COULD NOT BE USEFUL
IL EST ENTOURE D'UNE DE LA MULTITUDE AVIDE UNE MULTITUDE QUI NE VOIT QUE LUI TANDIS QUI LUI IL NE VOIT QUE LE CIEL
IN A CERTAIN SENSE THIS IS TRUE
THE RIGHT PATH IS THAT WHICH NECESSITATES THE GREATEST SACRIFICE OF SELF-INTEREST--WHICH IMPLIES THE GREATEST GOOD TO OTHERS
THEY COULD NOT HELP BUT THINK AND MOURN AND WONDER
I WILL NO LONGER SHRINK FROM ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS
THEY DID NOT LEAVE OFF READING AND LEARNING AS SOON AS THE COMPULSORY PRESSURE OF SCHOOL WAS TAKEN AWAY
AFTER BEING SEVERELY BAFFLED TWO OR THREE TIMES,--AFTER A WORLD OF TROUBLE IN THE WAY OF CORRESPONDENCE AND INTERVIEWS,--I HAVE AT LENGTH SUCCEEDED AND AM FAIRLY ESTABLISHED IN MY NEW PLACE
I MAKE THIS ENQUIRY BECAUSE I NOW THINK YOU TAKE A WHOLESOME INTEREST IN THE MATTER

THEY DON'T GET OVER THEIR DIFFICULTIES
THOUGH HE DID NOT SPEAK WHEN HE WAS ANNOYED OR DISPLEASED
THEY CAME FOR LEARNING

WITHIN SIX MILES OF MISS W---'S HOUSE--ON THE LEFT OF THE ROAD COMING FROM LEEDS--LIE THE REMAINS OF HOWLEY HALL NOW THE PROPERTY OF LORD CARDIGAN BUT FORMERLY BELONGING TO A BRANCH OF THE SAVILES
THE MILK TOO WAS OFTEN BINGY TO USE A COUNTRY EXPRESSION FOR A KIND OF TAINT THAT IS FAR WORSE THAN SOURNESS AND SUGGESTS THE IDEA THAT IT IS CAUSED BY WANT OF CLEANLINESS ABOUT THE MILK PANS RATHER THAN BY THE HEAT OF THE WEATHER
INDEED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS PAST I HAVE RECEIVED LETTERS ALMOST DAILY BEARING ON THE SUBJECT OF THIS CHAPTER
IN TRUTH IT IS WHAT I SHOULD WISH TO DO
IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO DO SO WHILE THERE IS SO LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR EVER GETTING PUPILS
WE HEAR OF HER AS MRS BRONTE BUT IT IS AS AN INVALID NOT FAR FROM DEATH
AMONG SEVERAL THINGS OF THE SAME KIND WHICH I WELL REMEMBER SHE TOLD ME WHAT HAD ONCE OCCURRED TO HERSELF
6 IMITATION
THE LITTLE ADVENTURE RECORDED AT THE END OF THE FOLLOWING LETTER IS UNCOMMON IN THE LOT OF MOST WOMEN AND IS A TESTIMONY IN THIS CASE TO THE UNUSUAL POWER OF ATTRACTION--THOUGH SO PLAIN IN FEATURE--WHICH CHARLOTTE POSSESSED WHEN SHE LET HERSELF GO IN THE HAPPINESS AND FREEDOM OF HOME
LIFE IN AN ISOLATED VILLAGE OR A LONELY COUNTRY-HOUSE PRESENTS MANY LITTLE OCCURRENCES WHICH SINK INTO THE MIND OF CHILDHOOD THERE TO BE BROODED OVER
I WISH I MAY BE ABLE TO SAY AS MUCH NEXT TIME I WRITE TO YOU
HE JUST GOT UP AND SPOKE WITH THE BOLDNESS OF A MAN WHO WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE TRUTH OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING WHO HAS NO FEAR OF HIS ENEMIES AND NO DREAD OF CONSEQUENCES
MR BRONTE'S FRIENDS ADVISED HIM TO SEND HIS SON TO SCHOOL
NOUS SAVONS MONSIEUR QUE VOUS PESEREZ PLUS MUREMENT ET PLUS SAGEMENT QUE NOUS LA CONSEQUENCE QU'AURAIT POUR L'AVENIR UNE INTERRUPTION COMPLETE DANS LES ETUDES DE VOS DEUX FILLES
NO PASSENGERS MIGHT SLEEP ON BOARD THEY SAID WITH SOME APPEARANCE OF DISRESPECT
NO TIME IS FIXED FOR THEIR RETURN BUT I HOPE IT WILL NOT BE DELAYED LONG OR I SHALL MISS THE CHANCE OF SEEING ANNE THIS VACATION
WITH MORE OF HOUSEHOLD INDEPENDENCE THAN SHE COULD EVER HAVE HAD DURING HER AUNT'S LIFETIME
THERE WERE NO EVENTS TO CHRONICLE IN THE HAWORTH LETTERS
THE LADY WITH WHOM SHE HAD LIVED AS GOVERNESS JUST BEFORE GOING TO BRUSSELS NOT ASKING HER FOR HER DAUGHTER--I CANNOT DO THAT--BUT INFORMING HER OF MY INTENTION
STILL THERE ARE THOSE REMAINING OF THIS CLASS--DWELLERS IN THE LONELY HOUSES FAR AWAY IN THE UPLAND DISTRICTS--EVEN AT THE PRESENT DAY WHO SUFFICIENTLY INDICATE WHAT STRANGE ECCENTRICITY--WHAT WILD STRENGTH OF WILL--NAY EVEN WHAT UNNATURAL POWER OF CRIME WAS FOSTERED BY A MODE OF LIVING IN WHICH A MAN SELDOM MET HIS FELLOWS AND WHERE PUBLIC OPINION WAS ONLY A DISTANT AND INARTICULATE ECHO OF SOME CLEARER VOICE SOUNDING BEHIND THE SWEEPING HORIZON
THE TABLET IS OF WHITE CARRARA MARBLE ON A GROUND OF DOVE-COLOURED MARBLE WITH A CORNICE SURMOUNTED BY AN ORNAMENTAL PEDIMENT OF CHASTE DESIGN
SHE EXPECTED MR S INSTANT DISMISSAL FROM HIS CURACY
YOUR LETTER GAVE ME REAL AND HEARTFELT PLEASURE MINGLED WITH NO SMALL SHARE OF ASTONISHMENT
OFT WHEN AWAKE ON CHRISTMAS MORN IN SLEEPLESS TWILIGHT LAID FORLORN STRANGE THOUGHTS HAVE O'ER MY MIND BEEN BORNE HOW HE HAS DIED FOR ME
THE CHIMNEYS OF THE HOUSES IN IT ARE BELOW YOUR FEET
AND THE EQUALLY MAD LETTERS OF MRS ELIZABETH ROWE FROM THE DEAD TO THE LIVING MR BRONTE ENCOURAGED A TASTE FOR READING IN HIS GIRLS
HER NATURE PROVED HERE TOO STRONG FOR HER FORTITUDE
I AM TOLERABLY WELL CONVINCED THAT I SHALL NEVER MARRY AT ALL
IT WAS HERE SHE RECEIVED HER FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE SEA

I COULD LIKE TO FEEL SOME MENTAL LIBERTY
OF COURSE IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT A NEW INSTITUTION COMPRISING DOMESTIC AND EDUCATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR NEARLY A HUNDRED PERSONS SHOULD WORK QUITE SMOOTHLY AT THE BEGINNING
ALL THIS LOOKED UPON AS A WELL-INVENTED FICTION IN SHIRLEY WAS WRITTEN DOWN BY CHARLOTTE WITH STREAMING EYES
THERE IS THE PLEASANT OLD FASHION OF WINDOW SEATS ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE
GENERALLY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE CONCERNS I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT THAT I DISCOVERED SIGNS OF RISING TALENT WHICH I HAD SELDOM OR NEVER BEFORE SEEN IN ANY OF THEIR AGE A CIRCUMSTANCE NOW OCCURS TO MY MIND WHICH I MAY AS WELL MENTION
AND MR BRONTE WAS OFTEN UNWILLING TO FALL INTO ANY ARRANGEMENT FOR MEETING AT BRADFORD OR OTHER PLACES WHICH WOULD OCCASION TROUBLE TO OTHERS
L'OPINION PUBLIQUE LA POPULARITE ETAIENT CHOSES DE GRAND VALEUR AUX YEUX DE NAPOLEON
IN THE BEGINNING OF 1833 THE TWO FRIENDS SEEM ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY TO HAVE FALLEN UPON KENILWORTH AND CHARLOTTE WRITES AS FOLLOWS ABOUT IT I AM GLAD YOU LIKE KENILWORTH IT IS CERTAINLY MORE RESEMBLING A ROMANCE THAN A NOVEL
THE HOUSE IS STILL REMAINING THAT FORMED PART OF THAT OCCUPIED BY THE SCHOOL
SHUT THE DOOR SAID THE RECIPIENT
LANES BRANCH OFF FOR THREE OR FOUR MILES TO HEATHS AND COMMONS ON THE HIGHER GROUND WHICH FORMED PLEASANT WALKS ON HOLIDAYS AND THEN COMES THE WHITE GATE INTO THE FIELD-PATH LEADING TO ROE HEAD ITSELF
AND THAT TO SPARE IT PAIN HE SHOT IT WITH HIS OWN HANDS AND BURIED IT WHERE THE GROUND SINKING AFTERWARDS BY THE WORKING OF A COAL PIT THE BONES CAME TO LIGHT
WE WERE DRIVING ALONG THE STREET WHEN ONE OF THOSE NE'ER-DO-WEEL LADS WHO SEEM TO HAVE A KIND OF MAGNETIC POWER FOR MISFORTUNES HAVING JUMPED INTO THE STREAM THAT RUNS THROUGH THE PLACE JUST WHERE ALL THE BROKEN GLASS AND BOTTLES ARE THROWN STAGGERED NAKED AND NEARLY COVERED WITH BLOOD INTO A COTTAGE BEFORE US
WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND REPRESENTED BY THE WORKERS OF YORKSHIRE LANCASHIRE AND NOTTINGHAMSHIRE SHOULD MAKE THEIR VOICE HEARD IN A TERRIBLE SLOGAN SINCE THEIR TRUE AND PITIFUL COMPLAINTS COULD FIND NO HEARING IN PARLIAMENT
ANNE HAD A SLIGHT COUGH A PAIN AT HER SIDE A DIFFICULTY OF BREATHING
AND FROM ITS HIGH SITUATION--ON A MOUND AS IT WERE SURROUNDED BY A CIRCULAR BASIN--COMMANDING A MAGNIFICENT VIEW
AND AFTER THE EXAMINATION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT SHE HAD COMPLETELY SHATTERED AND DISLOCATED ONE LEG
IN THAT CASE I MAKE NO DOUBT MY ASPIRATIONS AFTER LITERARY FAME WOULD HAVE MET WITH DUE ENCOURAGEMENT AND I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING MESSRS
V SOME MONTHS LONGER TILL I HAVE ACQUIRED GERMAN
HENCE A VISIT FROM CHARLOTTE REQUIRED A GOOD DEAL OF PRE-ARRANGEMENT
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME AS INDIVIDUALS THE REMARKABLE DEGREE OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY THEY POSSESS GIVES THEM AN AIR OF INDEPENDENCE RATHER APT TO REPEL A STRANGER

AFTERWARDS I DETERMINED TO GIVE ONE ANSWER ONCE FOR ALL
BUT HER EYES HAD FAILED HER IN THE MINUTE AND USELESS LABOUR WHICH SHE HAD IMPOSED UPON HERSELF WITH A VIEW TO THIS END

SHE WAS UNABLE HOWEVER TO GIVE ME YOUR EXACT ADDRESS
AND ABOUT THIS TIME SHE THUS WRITES TO M
I MADE AN APPEAL TO AUNT FOR ASSISTANCE WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY CONSENT
SHE ANSWERED THE BIBLE AND WHAT WAS THE NEXT BEST
THE ONLY GIG LET OUT TO HIRE IN HAWORTH IS AT HARROWGATE AND LIKELY TO REMAIN THERE FOR AUGHT I CAN HEAR
BUT NO STUDY HOWEVER INTERESTING INTERFERED WITH THE GOODNESS OF THE BREAD WHICH WAS ALWAYS LIGHT AND EXCELLENT
WHEN I SAW HER LAST SHE WAS A YOUNG BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPY GIRL
ON A DIT JE LE SAIS QU'ELLE FUT CRUELLE LA MAIN QUI LE SEPARA DE SA FEMME ET DE SON ENFANT
COME JOHN LOOK TO HER HUSBAND
SO COURAGE MON AMIE AS THE OLD CHEVALIERS USED TO SAY BEFORE THEY JOINED BATTLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER OF 1835 A GREAT FAMILY PLAN WAS MOOTED AT THE PARSONAGE
THE OTHER WITH E WHO HAS KINDLY ENTRUSTED ME WITH A LARGE PORTION OF MISS BRONTE'S CORRESPONDENCE WITH HER
HE HAD A STRONGER DESIRE FOR LITERARY FAME BURNING IN HIS HEART THAN EVEN THAT WHICH OCCASIONALLY FLASHED UP IN HIS SISTERS HE TRIED VARIOUS OUTLETS FOR HIS TALENTS
BUT FOR MEDICAL ADVICE FOR STATIONERY BOOKS LAW DRESS OR DAINTIES THE INHABITANTS HAD TO GO TO KEIGHLEY
MISS BRANWELL WAS UNAWARE OF THE FERMENTATION OF UNOCCUPIED TALENT GOING ON AROUND HER
STILL AS IT IS THE EXCEPTIONAL AND EXAGGERATED CHARACTERISTICS OF ANY PERIOD THAT LEAVE THE MOST VIVID MEMORY BEHIND THEM IT WOULD BE WRONG AND IN MY OPINION FAITHLESS TO CONCLUDE THAT SUCH AND SUCH FORMS OF SOCIETY AND MODES OF LIVING WERE NOT BEST FOR THE PERIOD WHEN THEY PREVAILED ALTHOUGH THE ABUSES THEY MAY HAVE LED INTO AND THE GRADUAL PROGRESS OF THE WORLD HAVE MADE IT WELL THAT SUCH WAYS AND MANNERS SHOULD PASS AWAY FOR EVER AND AS PREPOSTEROUS TO ATTEMPT TO RETURN TO THEM AS IT WOULD BE FOR A MAN TO RETURN TO THE CLOTHES OF HIS CHILDHOOD
SHE OWNED SHE DID NOT LIKE IT

AND I HAVE ALREADY GOT TO THE POINT OF CONSIDERING THAT THERE IS NO MORE RESPECTABLE CHARACTER ON THIS EARTH THAN AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WHO MAKES HER OWN WAY THROUGH LIFE QUIETLY PERSEVERINGLY WITHOUT SUPPORT OF HUSBAND OR BROTHER
IN THE LATTER HE SUCCEEDED AS FAR AS REGARDED HIS DAUGHTERS
HER QUICK EAR DETECTED SOMETHING OF THE THICK GUTTURAL PRONUNCIATION WHICH FRENCHMEN SAY THEY ARE ABLE TO DISCOVER EVEN IN THE GRANDCHILDREN OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN WHO HAVE LIVED ANY TIME BEYOND THE RHINE
THOSE WHO KNEW HER THEN DESCRIBE HER AS GRAVE THOUGHTFUL AND QUIET TO A DEGREE FAR BEYOND HER YEARS
THE SOIL IN THE VALLEY OR BOTTOM TO USE THE LOCAL TERM IS RICH
THERE ARE THOSE YET ALIVE WHO REMEMBER SEVEN HEAVILY-LADEN CARTS LUMBERING SLOWLY UP THE LONG STONE STREET BEARING THE NEW PARSON'S HOUSEHOLD GOODS TO HIS FUTURE ABODE
YOU HEARD FROM OTHERS OF MISS W---'S OVERTURES BEFORE I COMMUNICATED THEM TO YOU MYSELF
SHE SENT ME 10_L
BUT THE AFFECTION AMONG ALL THE THREE WAS STRONGER THAN EITHER DEATH OR LIFE

IT IS A REAL GENUINE PLEASURE TO HEAR FROM HOME
AND EVEN AFTER HE WAS EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE HE TOOK GREAT DELIGHT IN BREAKING REFRACTORY STEEDS
YOU ASK ME TO RECOMMEND YOU SOME BOOKS FOR YOUR PERUSAL
I HAVE AN ODD CIRCUMSTANCE TO RELATE TO YOU
C'EST LA FRANCE QUE NAPOLEON A EPOUSEE
THEREFORE I WILL LET HER MANAGE STILL AND TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES
FROM PENZANCE WHERE PLANTS WHICH WE IN THE NORTH CALL GREENHOUSE FLOWERS GROW IN GREAT PROFUSION AND WITHOUT ANY SHELTER EVEN IN THE WINTER AND WHERE THE SOFT WARM CLIMATE ALLOWS THE INHABITANTS IF SO DISPOSED TO LIVE PRETTY CONSTANTLY IN THE OPEN AIR IT WAS A GREAT CHANGE FOR A LADY CONSIDERABLY PAST FORTY TO COME AND TAKE UP HER ABODE IN A PLACE WHERE NEITHER FLOWERS NOR VEGETABLES WOULD FLOURISH AND WHERE A TREE OF EVEN MODERATE DIMENSIONS MIGHT BE HUNTED FOR FAR AND WIDE
BUT HOW
HEGER'S TESTIMONY
THE DEEP AND EXAGGERATED CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER PERSONAL DEFECTS--THE CONSTITUTIONAL ABSENCE OF HOPE WHICH MADE HER SLOW TO TRUST IN HUMAN AFFECTION AND CONSEQUENTLY SLOW TO RESPOND TO ANY MANIFESTATION OF IT--MADE HER MANNER SHY AND CONSTRAINED TO MEN AND WOMEN AND EVEN TO CHILDREN
WHERE HIS MATE
AND EVEN WITH THIS HELP THEY SEEM TO BE IN CONSTANT DANGER OF SLIPPING BACKWARDS
THE OWNERS ARE IN FACT THE REMAINS OF THE OLD YEOMANRY--SMALL SQUIRES--WHO ARE RAPIDLY BECOMING EXTINCT AS A CLASS FROM ONE OF TWO CAUSES
SO LIABLE AS SHE WAS TO MORBID AND ACUTE MENTAL SUFFERING
QUIET DAYS OCCUPIED IN REACHING AND FEMININE OCCUPATIONS IN THE HOUSE DID NOT PRESENT MUCH TO WRITE ABOUT
IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AN AGREEABLE WOMAN
AND HER FEEBLE CONSTITUTION WAS ALWAYS PAINFULLY SENSITIVE TO AN INCLEMENT SEASON
IT IS PROBABLE THAT EVEN HER SISTERS AND MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS DID NOT KNOW OF THIS DREAD OF ULTIMATE BLINDNESS WHICH BESET HER AT THIS PERIOD
THERE WAS AN OBSERVATION IN YOUR LAST LETTER WHICH EXCITED FOR A MOMENT MY WRATH
YET I COULD NOT FORBEAR WEEPING AT HIS WORDS SPOKEN SO UNEXPECTEDLY AT THAT PARTICULAR PERIOD THOUGH THE DATE OF THE FOLLOWING POEM IS A LITTLE UNCERTAIN IT MAY BE MOST CONVENIENT TO INTRODUCE IT HERE
JUST SUFFICIENTLY RETIRED FROM THE ROAD TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN SCARCELY BELONG TO ANY ONE LIABLE TO BE SUMMONED IN A HURRY AT THE CALL OF SUFFERING OR DANGER FROM HIS COMFORTABLE FIRESIDE
THE REST OF THE GROUND IS OCCUPIED BY A SQUARE GRASS PLOT AND A GRAVEL WALK
THEY THOUGHT THAT BY A LITTLE CONTRIVANCE AND A VERY LITTLE ADDITIONAL BUILDING A SMALL NUMBER OF PUPILS FOUR OR SIX MIGHT BE ACCOMMODATED IN THE PARSONAGE
ANNE HAD BEEN FOR SOME LITTLE TIME IN A SITUATION TO WHICH SHE WAS TO RETURN AT THE END OF THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY IT BECAME FAMOUS IN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD AS THE SCENE OF THE MINISTRATIONS OF THE REV
THEN AT NIGHT SHE WAS AN INVALUABLE STORY-TELLER FRIGHTENING THEM ALMOST OUT OF THEIR WITS AS THEY LAY IN BED
THE RISING OF ALL THE PEERESSES WHEN HE ROSE
THERE ARE THREE TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOL--MADEMOISELLE BLANCHE MADEMOISELLE SOPHIE AND MADEMOISELLE MARIE
THE CHURCHYARD
THE INHABITANTS WERE A CHAPEL-GOING PEOPLE VERY CRITICAL ABOUT THE DOCTRINE OF THEIR SERMONS TYRANNICAL TO THEIR MINISTERS AND VIOLENT RADICALS IN POLITICS
AND A DOGGED YET IN SOME CASES FINE INDIFFERENCE TO HUMAN LIFE WAS THUS GENERATED
BUT AT THIS TIME SOME LITTLE MISTAKE OCCURRED AND SHE DESIRED MESSRS
SOME PECULIAR ODOUR SHE SAYS MADE HER RECOGNISE THAT THEY WERE SICKENING FOR THE FEVER AND SHE TOLD MR WILSON SO AND THAT SHE COULD NOT STAY THERE FOR FEAR OF CONVEYING THE INFECTION TO HER OWN CHILDREN
A DREARY SEASON IT WAS TO THE FAMILY IN THE PARSONAGE
AND IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL YOU ARE ONLY LIKE OURSELVES
EMILY AND ANNE SAY THEY NEVER SAW ANY ONE THEY LIKED SO WELL AS YOU AND TABBY WHOM YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY FASCINATED TALKS A GREAT DEAL MORE NONSENSE ABOUT YOUR LADYSHIP THAN I CARE TO REPEAT
BOTH BOTTLED UP THEIR WRATH FOR THAT TIME BUT IT WAS ONLY TO EXPLODE WITH REDOUBLED FORCE AT A FUTURE PERIOD
WHAT A CONTRAST TO THAT MUST THE BELGIAN CAPITAL HAVE PRESENTED TO THOSE TWO YOUNG WOMEN THUS LEFT BEHIND
P.S
COMPLETED MAY 8TH 1830
JE LA CROIS POURTANT AIMEE ET APPRECIEE PAR SES ELEVES THERE WERE FROM EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED PUPILS IN THE PENSIONNAT WHEN CHARLOTTE AND EMILY BRONTE ENTERED IN FEBRUARY 1842
I HAVE GOT ANOTHER BALE OF FRENCH BOOKS FROM G
PER HEAD ALL OF WHICH WAS DEFRAYED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED
BUT I SUSPECT THAT THEY HAD NO CHILDREN'S BOOKS AND THAT THEIR EAGER MINDS BROWZED UNDISTURBED AMONG THE WHOLESOME PASTURAGE OF ENGLISH LITERATURE AS CHARLES LAMB EXPRESSES IT
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WHEN SHE WAS BETWEEN THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN
I KNOW MANY OF HIS FAULTY ACTIONS MANY OF HIS WEAK POINTS
ANNE IS COME HOME AND HER PRESENCE CERTAINLY MAKES ME FEEL MORE AT LIBERTY
AND SOMETIMES BY A NEIGHBOURING CLERGYMAN WHO CAME DOWN THE HILLS ACROSS THE MOORS TO MOUNT UP AGAIN TO HAWORTH PARSONAGE AND SPEND AN EVENING THERE
THE VILLAGE LIES EMBEDDED IN THE MOORS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTIES ON THE OLD ROAD BETWEEN KEIGHLEY AND COLNE
HE WROTE AND SENT POEMS TO WORDSWORTH AND COLERIDGE WHO BOTH EXPRESSED KIND AND LAUDATORY OPINIONS AND HE FREQUENTLY CONTRIBUTED VERSES TO THE LEEDS MERCURY
MARTHA--PRETTY WINNING MISCHIEVOUS TRICKSOME MARTHA--WAS TAKEN ILL SUDDENLY AT THE CHATEAU DE KOEKELBERG
THE VERY BUILDING THEY OCCUPIED AS PUPILS IN MADAME HEGER'S PENSIONNAT HAD ITS OWN GHOSTLY TRAIN OF SPLENDID ASSOCIATIONS MARCHING FOR EVER IN SHADOWY PROCESSION THROUGH AND THROUGH THE ANCIENT ROOMS AND SHADED ALLEYS OF THE GARDENS
SHE HAD BEEN DISCOURAGED IN LITERATURE
B TOWARDS THE END OF THIS YEAR 1843 VARIOUS REASONS CONSPIRED WITH THE CAUSES OF ANXIETY WHICH HAVE BEEN MENTIONED TO MAKE HER FEEL THAT HER PRESENCE WAS ABSOLUTELY AND IMPERATIVELY REQUIRED AT HOME WHILE SHE HAD ACQUIRED ALL THAT SHE PROPOSED TO HERSELF IN COMING TO BRUSSELS THE SECOND TIME
AYLOTT SUGGEST THAT COPIES AND ADVERTISEMENTS OF THE WORK SHOULD BE SENT TO THE ATHENAEUM LITERARY GAZETTE CRITIC AND TIMES BUT IN HER REPLY MISS BRONTE SAYS THAT SHE THINKS THE PERIODICALS SHE FIRST MENTIONED WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR ADVERTISING IN AT PRESENT AS THE AUTHORS DO NOT WISH TO LAY OUT A LARGER SUM THAN TWO POUNDS IN ADVERTISING ESTEEMING THE SUCCESS OF A WORK DEPENDENT MORE ON THE NOTICE IT RECEIVES FROM PERIODICALS THAN ON THE QUANTITY OF ADVERTISEMENTS
THUS FAR IS LIKELY ENOUGH
I SEE MORE CLEARLY THAN I HAVE EVER DONE BEFORE THAT A PRIVATE GOVERNESS HAS NO EXISTENCE IS NOT CONSIDERED AS A LIVING RATIONAL BEING EXCEPT AS CONNECTED WITH THE WEARISOME DUTIES SHE HAS TO FULFIL ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST AFTERNOONS I HAVE SPENT HERE--INDEED THE ONLY ONE AT ALL PLEASANT--WAS WHEN MR
IF IT IS NOT ABSOLUTE TREASON I DO FERVENTLY REQUEST THAT YOU WILL CONTRIVE IN SOME WAY OR OTHER TO LET ME HAVE A SIGHT OF YOUR FACE
IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF BRANWELL HAD A CHANCE OF GETTING EMPLOYMENT AND I WAITED TO KNOW THE RESULT OF HIS EFFORTS IN ORDER TO SAY DEAR COME AND SEE US
NOT MUCH MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT AFTER THIS ATTACK ON RAWFOLDS ANOTHER MANUFACTURER WHO EMPLOYED THE OBNOXIOUS MACHINERY WAS SHOT DOWN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AS HE WAS PASSING OVER CROSSLAND MOOR WHICH WAS SKIRTED BY A SMALL PLANTATION IN WHICH THE MURDERERS LAY HIDDEN
AND THEN AGAIN POETRY OUGHT TO BRIGHTEN AND CROWN THAT NAME WITH GLORY
SUCH A VEHEMENT IMPATIENCE OF RESTRAINT AND STEADY WORK
NOUS N'AVONS PAS EU A LEUR APPRENDRE LE PRIX DU TEMPS ET DE L'INSTRUCTION ELLES AVAIENT APPRIS TOUT CELA DANS LA MAISON PATERNELLE ET NOUS N'AVONS EU POUR NOTRE PART QUE LE FAIBLE MERITE DE DIRIGER LEURS EFFORTS ET DE FOURNIR UN ALIMENT CONVENABLE A LA LOUABLE ACTIVITE QUE VOS FILLES ONT PUISEES DANS VOTRE EXEMPLE ET DANS VOS LECONS
HARD LABOUR FROM SIX IN THE MORNING TO ELEVEN AT NIGHT WITH ONLY ONE HALF HOUR OF EXERCISE BETWEEN
MY TIME AS I HAVE OFTEN TOLD YOU IS FULLY OCCUPIED
I HAD A KINDLY LEANING TOWARDS HIM BECAUSE HE IS AN AMIABLE AND WELL-DISPOSED MAN
NO DOUBT IT MUST EVER BE A LIFE OF SACRIFICE
WELLESLEY'S TALE TO HIS BROTHER
I FEAR YOU ARE GIVING YOURSELF TOO MUCH TROUBLE ON OUR ACCOUNT
I THINK HOWEVER LONG I LIVE I SHALL NOT FORGET WHAT THE PARTING WITH M
I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE WILL OF HER FATHER
A FEW MORE NOTES REMAIN OF HER CORRESPONDENCE ON BEHALF OF THE MESSRS
NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE ETAIT AVIDE DE RENOMMEE ET DE GLOIRE
HE CAN SEE IT FOR TWO MILES BEFORE HE ARRIVES FOR IT IS SITUATED ON THE SIDE OF A PRETTY STEEP HILL WITH A BACK-GROUND OF DUN AND PURPLE MOORS RISING AND SWEEPING AWAY YET HIGHER THAN THE CHURCH WHICH IS BUILT AT THE VERY SUMMIT OF THE LONG NARROW STREET
THE ISLE OF ARRAN FOR ME ANNE
BUT TEARS ARE FRUITLESS AND I TRY NOT TO REPINE DURING THIS WINTER CHARLOTTE EMPLOYED HER LEISURE HOURS IN WRITING A STORY
OF THIS WILD WEIRD WRITING A SINGLE EXAMPLE WILL SUFFICE
I OUGHT TO HAVE ANNOUNCED THIS INTENTION TO YOU BEFORE BUT I QUITE FORGOT I WAS A SUBSCRIBER
SHE ANSWERED THAT WHICH WOULD MAKE HER RULE HER HOUSE WELL LASTLY I ASKED THE OLDEST WHAT WAS THE BEST MODE OF SPENDING TIME
THE FLAG-STONES WITH WHICH IT IS PAVED ARE PLACED END-WAYS IN ORDER TO GIVE A BETTER HOLD TO THE HORSES FEET
THE NUMBER OF PUPILS WAS SO SMALL THAT THE ATTENDANCE TO CERTAIN SUBJECTS AT PARTICULAR HOURS COMMON IN LARGER SCHOOLS WAS NOT RIGIDLY ENFORCED
BUT MISS BRANWELL PERSEVERED
FOR THAT HOUSE WHICH WAS TO BE REGARDED AS AN OCCASIONAL HOME FOR THEIR BROTHER COULD HARDLY BE A FITTING RESIDENCE FOR THE CHILDREN OF STRANGERS
MAKING THE WHOLE SUM WHICH EACH PUPIL BRINGS WITH HER TO THE SCHOOL 7_L
BUT WE DUNNA THINK HE'LL COME WHY NOT HE'S OWD YO SEEN AND ASTHMATIC AND IT'S UP-HILL MY HUSBAND TAKING A BOY FOR HIS GUIDE DROVE AS FAST AS HE COULD TO THE SURGEON'S HOUSE WHICH WAS ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE OFF AND MET THE AUNT OF THE WOUNDED LAD LEAVING IT
THEY SET TO THEIR STUDIES NOT AS TO TASKS OR DUTIES TO BE GOT THROUGH BUT WITH A HEALTHY DESIRE AND THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH SHE HAD MANAGED TO MAKE THEM PERCEIVE THE RELISHING SAVOUR
AND AS TO INTENSE PASSION I AM CONVINCED THAT THAT IS NO DESIRABLE FEELING
OF THESE WEDDING EXPEDITIONS FROM THE BRIDGE TO THE TOLL-BAR AT HAWORTH
WE ARE DISTANT COLD AND RESERVED
IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A TALE AND THE ACTORS IN IT ARE DRAWN WITH MUCH OF THE GRACE OF CHARACTERISTIC PORTRAIT-PAINTING IN PERFECTLY PURE AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE WHICH DISTINGUISHES SO MANY OF ADDISON'S PAPERS IN THE SPECTATOR THE FRAGMENT IS TOO SHORT TO AFFORD THE MEANS OF JUDGING WHETHER HE HAD MUCH DRAMATIC TALENT AS THE PERSONS OF THE STORY ARE NOT THROWN INTO CONVERSATION
OR WENT OFTEN DOWN THE LONG ROAD TO KEIGHLEY FOR SUCH BOOKS AS HAD BEEN ADDED TO THE LIBRARY THERE DURING THEIR ABSENCE FROM ENGLAND
HOWEVER MORE GENIAL WEATHER IS COMING NOW AND I WISH YOU WERE HERE
SUCH CUSTOMS WERE THE OUTWARD SIGNS OF THE KIND OF PEOPLE WITH WHOM MR GRIMSHAW HAD TO DEAL
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PLACE TELLS OF THE MOST DAINTY ORDER THE MOST EXQUISITE CLEANLINESS
LIFFEY CASTLE A TALE BY LORD C
LIFE AND FRIENDSHIP YET BLESSED THEM
THEY ARE LIKE THE REST CLEVER WICKED SOPHISTICAL AND IMMORAL
I WAS HEARING THE TERRIBLE FIFTH SECTION WHEN YOUR NOTE ARRIVED
THERE WAS NOTHING SHE SAID BUT RUIN BEFORE THEM
THIS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR HER TO GO THROUGH LONG AND DEEP HISTORIES OF FEELING AND IMAGINATION FOR WHICH OTHERS ODD AS IT SOUNDS HAVE RARELY TIME
AND THIS PROSPECT MUST NOT BE A SITUATION
I SHALL WATCH AND WAIT FOR YOU AND IF YOU DISAPPOINT ME I SHALL WEEP
NOW IF THE YOUNG WOMAN EXPECTS SENSE IN THIS PRODUCTION SHE WILL FIND HERSELF MISERABLY DISAPPOINTED
SONG OF AN EXILE
JAMAIS IL NE PARLE DE SES EXPLOITS ET JAMAIS IL NE SOUFFRE QU'UN AUTRE LUI EN PARLE EN SA PRESENCE
BUT OWING TO MRS BRONTE'S DEATH SO SOON AFTER HER HUSBAND HAD REMOVED INTO THE DISTRICT AND ALSO TO THE DISTANCES AND THE BLEAK COUNTRY TO BE TRAVERSED THE WIVES OF THESE CLERICAL FRIENDS DID NOT ACCOMPANY THEIR HUSBANDS
SHE THUS WRITES TO HER FRIEND E APRIL 1843
I MIGHT MORE TRULY HAVE SOUGHT IN HER PRESENTMENT--NAY IN HER LIVING FACE--FOR THE SIGN OF DEATH--IN HER PRIME
HAS GIVEN ANOTHER LECTURE AT THE KEIGHLEY MECHANICS INSTITUTION AND PAPA HAS ALSO GIVEN A LECTURE
WHETHER THE LINES WERE RECOLLECTED OR INVENTED THE TALE PROVES SUCH HABITS OF SEDENTARY MONOTONOUS SOLITUDE OF THOUGHT AS WOULD HAVE SHAKEN A FEEBLER MIND OF COURSE THE STATE OF HEALTH THUS DESCRIBED CAME ON GRADUALLY AND IS NOT TO BE TAKEN AS A PICTURE OF HER CONDITION IN 1836
TO USE M
RETURNED IN TIME TO ALLOW CHARLOTTE TO GO AND LOOK AFTER ANNE'S HEALTH WHICH AS SHE FOUND TO HER INTENSE ANXIETY WAS FAR FROM STRONG
THE HIEROGLYPHICS OF CHILDHOOD WERE AN UNKNOWN LANGUAGE TO THEM FOR THEY HAD NEVER BEEN MUCH WITH THOSE YOUNGER THAN THEMSELVES
HEGER'S TUITION
LIVING IS THERE LITTLE MORE THAN HALF AS DEAR AS IT IS IN ENGLAND AND THE FACILITIES FOR EDUCATION ARE EQUAL OR SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER PLACE IN EUROPE
HE TREATED HER AND HER CHILD SAVAGELY
MARTHA THE YOUNGER DAUGHTER SLEEPS IN THE PROTESTANT CEMETERY AT BRUSSELS
CONTAINING UPWARDS OF FORTY VOLUMES
WHILE CHARLOTTE WAS TOO PHYSICALLY WEAK AS MARY HAS EXPRESSED IT TO GATHER UP HER FORCES SUFFICIENTLY TO EXPRESS ANY DIFFERENCE OR OPPOSITION OF OPINION AND HAD CONSEQUENTLY AN ASSENTING AND DEFERENTIAL MANNER STRANGELY AT VARIANCE WITH WHAT THEY KNEW OF HER REMARKABLE TALENTS AND DECIDED CHARACTER
SO I CAN READ MY TITLE CLEAR TO MANSIONS IN THE SKIES AND LET ME BID FAREWELL TO FEAR AND WIPE MY WEEPING EYES I'LL LAY ME DOWN ON THIS MARBLE STONE AND SET THE WORLD ASIDE TO SEE UPON HER EBON THRONE THE MOON IN GLORY RIDE
NOW DON'T BE NONPLUSSED BY ALL THIS METAPHORICAL MYSTERY
THE LATTER GENTLEMAN BY NAME MR B IS A YOUNG IRISH CLERGYMAN FRESH FROM DUBLIN UNIVERSITY
ON SATURDAY EVENING ABOUT THE TIME WHEN YOU WERE WRITING THE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR IMAGINARY SHIPWRECK I WAS READING AND FEELING THE EFFECTS OF A REAL ONE HAVING THEN RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MY SISTER GIVING ME AN ACCOUNT OF THE VESSEL IN WHICH SHE HAD SENT MY BOX BEING STRANDED ON THE COAST OF DEVONSHIRE IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH THE BOX WAS DASHED TO PIECES WITH THE VIOLENCE OF THE SEA AND ALL MY LITTLE PROPERTY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A VERY FEW ARTICLES BEING SWALLOWED UP IN THE MIGHTY DEEP
THIS LADY'S GRANDDAUGHTER WAS RECEIVING HER EDUCATION AT THE PENSIONNAT OF MADAME HEGER
I WISH SHE WOULD HAVE ME
I TOLD SOME TIME SINCE THAT I MEANT TO GET A SITUATION AND WHEN I SAID SO MY RESOLUTION WAS QUITE FIXED
MY PRESENT LIFE IS SO DELIGHTFUL SO CONGENIAL TO MY OWN NATURE COMPARED TO THAT OF A GOVERNESS
IN LIEU OF FROCKS PELISSE BONNET TIPPET AND FRILLS
YOU HAVE RECEIVED ADMONITION AS CONSIDERATELY AND AS KINDLY AS IT WAS GIVEN
AND AT HOME HE WAS AS YET THE CHERISHED FAVOURITE
THOUGH I AM FULLY PERSUADED THAT HE WAS SOME FANATICAL ENTHUSIAST WELL MEANING PERHAPS BUT UTTERLY IGNORANT OF TRUE PIETY
HE WAS RATHER PAST MIDDLE AGE WHEN HE BETHOUGHT HIM OF INSURING HIS LIFE
INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS NO PECULIARITY
THESE TEN MEN HOWEVER MANAGED TO KEEP UP SUCH A VIGOROUS AND WELL-DIRECTED FIRE OF MUSKETRY THAT THEY DEFEATED ALL THE DESPERATE ATTEMPTS OF THE MULTITUDE OUTSIDE TO BREAK DOWN THE DOORS AND FORCE A WAY INTO THE MILL
BUT IN THEIR CAREFUL EMPLOYMENT OF TIME THEY FOUND MANY AN ODD FIVE MINUTES FOR READING WHILE WATCHING THE CAKES AND MANAGED THE UNION OF TWO KINDS OF EMPLOYMENT BETTER THAN KING ALFRED
I WAS EAGER FOR HER TO GO ON AND WHEN SHE SAID THERE WAS NO MORE I SAID BUT GO ON
THERE SHE LEFT HER
IN THAT MANSION WERE HELD ALL THE SPLENDID FEASTS OF THE GRAND SERMENT DES ARBALETRIERS
THEY WERE GRAVE AND SILENT BEYOND THEIR YEARS
SIX OR EIGHT BOARDERS REMAINED BESIDES THE MISS BRONTES
SOMETHING IN ME WHICH USED TO BE ENTHUSIASM IS TAMED DOWN AND BROKEN
THERE IS HARDLY ONE OF HER PROSE-WRITINGS AT THIS TIME IN WHICH THEY ARE NOT THE PRINCIPAL PERSONAGES AND IN WHICH THEIR AUGUST FATHER DOES NOT APPEAR AS A SORT OF JUPITER TONANS OR DEUS EX MACHINA
HE ALWAYS WHISTLES TO THE DOG AND GIVES HIM A CARESS THE FEELING WHICH IN CHARLOTTE PARTOOK OF SOMETHING OF THE NATURE OF AN AFFECTION WAS WITH EMILY MORE OF A PASSION
THE READING OF HIS SPEECH--PAPA SAYING THAT HIS WORDS WERE LIKE PRECIOUS GOLD
MORE OF HIS DUTY MUST DEVOLVE ON A CURATE AND MR BRONTE ALWAYS LIBERAL WOULD HAVE TO PAY AT A HIGHER RATE THAN HE HAD HERETOFORE DONE FOR THIS ASSISTANCE
UNDOUBTEDLY MY DUTY DIRECTS ME TO STAY AT HOME FOR THE PRESENT
BY THE SIDE OF THE LITTLE SHALLOW SPARKLING VIGOROUS LECK RUN LONG PASTURE FIELDS OF THE FINE SHORT GRASS COMMON IN HIGH LAND
QUELQUEFOIS C'EST UN ENTHOUSIASTE RELIGIEUX COMME MAHOMET OU PIERRE L'HERMITE QUI AVEC LE SEUL LEVIER DE LA PENSEE SOULEVE DES NATIONS ENTIERES LES DERACINE ET LES TRANSPLANTE DANS DES CLIMATS NOUVEAUX PEUPLANT L'ASIE AVEC LES HABITANTS DE L'EUROPE
WHEN MR REDHEAD WAS REPELLED A FRESH DIFFICULTY AROSE
YOU SAY AND I SEE PLAINLY THAT YOUR FEELINGS HAVE BEEN HURT BY AN APPARENT WANT OF CONFIDENCE ON MY PART
I WILL PUT BY THE REST AND NOT TROUBLE YOU WITH THEM
AT AN AGE WHEN GIRLS IN GENERAL LOOK FORWARD TO AN ETERNAL DURATION OF SUCH FEELINGS AS THEY OR THEIR FRIENDS ENTERTAIN AND CAN THEREFORE SEE NO HINDRANCE TO THE FULFILMENT OF ANY ENGAGEMENTS DEPENDENT ON THE FUTURE STATE OF THE AFFECTIONS SHE IS SURPRISED THAT E KEEPS HER PROMISE TO WRITE
HAWORTH NEAR BRADFORD YORKSHIRE JANUARY 19 1837
I USE THIS EXPRESSION SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN THE LARGEST SENSE
AND THOUGH I SAW FAULTS IN HIS CHARACTER EXCUSED THEM BECAUSE OF THE AMUSEMENT HIS ORIGINALITY AFFORDED
BUT SOUTHEY WAS DEAD
HE SLEPT MOANING FOR NIGHTS AT THE DOOR OF HER EMPTY ROOM AND NEVER SO TO SPEAK REJOICED DOG FASHION AFTER HER DEATH
YOU WILL ABUSE THIS LETTER FOR BEING SHORT AND DREARY AND THERE ARE A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH I WANT TO TELL YOU BUT I HAVE NOT TIME
BOTH WERE NOT MENTAL BUT PHYSICAL ILLNESSES
BUT ACCORDING TO MY INFORMANT THE MOTHER WAS NOT VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE MUCH OF HER CHILDREN PROBABLY BECAUSE THE SIGHT OF THEM KNOWING HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE LEFT MOTHERLESS WOULD HAVE AGITATED HER TOO MUCH
SHE SIMPLY REPLIED AN ACCIDENT MA'AM AND NO FURTHER INQUIRY WAS MADE
THE AGREEMENT WAS CONCLUDED AND THE BRONTES PREPARED TO LEAVE THEIR NATIVE COUNTY FOR THE FIRST TIME IF WE EXCEPT THE MELANCHOLY AND MEMORABLE RESIDENCE AT COWAN BRIDGE
I AM OBLIGED THEREFORE TO DEVOTE THE EVENINGS TO THIS BUSINESS
DISTINCT AND GRAPHIC IN EXPRESSION AS BECOMES A CHERISHED ASSOCIATE OF CHARLOTTE BRONTE'S
I SHALL DRESS HER A DISH OF SALMAGUNDI--I SHALL COOK A HASH--COMPOUND A STEW--TOSS UP AN OMELETTE SOUFFLEE A LA FRANCAISE AND SEND IT HER WITH MY RESPECTS
EMILY WAS RESERVED
IL FALLAIT QUE CETTE ELOQUENCE FUT D'UNE FORCE PRESQUE MIRACULEUSE QUI POUVAIT PRESQU'ELLE PERSUAD_ER AIT AUX ROIS DE VENDRE LEURS ROYAUMES AFIN DE PROCURER POUR AVOIR DES ARMES ET DES SOLDATS POUR AIDER A OFFRIR A PIERRE DANS LA GUERRE SAINTE QU'IL VOULAIT LIVRER AUX INFIDELES
I AM VERY GLAD I WENT TO--WHEN I DID FOR THE CHANGED WEATHER HAS SOMEWHAT CHANGED MY HEALTH AND STRENGTH SINCE
MR AND MRS FENNEL SANCTIONED IT AND HER BROTHER AND SISTERS IN FAR-AWAY PENZANCE APPEAR FULLY TO HAVE APPROVED OF IT
SHE KNEW THE NAMES OF THE TWO MINISTRIES
HERE AT THORNTON CHARLOTTE BRONTE WAS BORN ON THE 21ST OF APRIL 1816
AND PERHAPS THE HAMLET OF COWAN BRIDGE HAD A MORE PROSPEROUS LOOK THAN IT BEARS AT PRESENT
SONG OF THE ANCIENT BRITONS
HE DID NOT REQUIRE COMPANIONSHIP THEREFORE HE DID NOT SEEK IT EITHER IN HIS WALKS OR IN HIS DAILY LIFE
SHE DESCRIBED TO ME PRETTY MUCH AS SHE HAS SINCE DESCRIBED IT IN VILLETTE HER SENSE OF LONELINESS AND YET HER STRANGE PLEASURE IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE SITUATION AS IN THE DEAD OF THAT WINTER'S NIGHT SHE WENT SWIFTLY OVER THE DARK RIVER TO THE BLACK HULL'S SIDE AND WAS AT FIRST REFUSED LEAVE TO ASCEND TO THE DECK
YES SHERIDAN WAS CLEVER,--SCAMPS OFTEN ARE
SHE WOULD MAKE ME ACQUAINTED WITH THE CITY
WOULD TELL US THE AUTHORS THE POEMS THEY WERE TAKEN FROM AND SOMETIMES REPEAT A PAGE OR TWO AND TELL US THE PLOT
AND WAS DEEPLY ENGAGED IN TRANSACTIONS THE MEMORY OF WHICH WAS YET RECENT WHEN SHE HEARD OF THEM AND OF THE PART WHICH HE HAD HAD IN THEM
WELL-MEANING WOMEN HAVE THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES TO COMFORT THEM AFTER ALL
ON SATURDAYS A KIND OF PIE OR MIXTURE OF POTATOES AND MEAT WAS SERVED UP WHICH WAS MADE OF ALL THE FRAGMENTS ACCUMULATED DURING THE WEEK
THE CARNIVAL WAS NOTHING BUT MASKING AND MUMMERY
DID LONGING FOR AFFECTION LOST BARB EVERY DEADLY DART
AND IF THEY HAD STRENGTH AND TIME TO GO FAR ENOUGH THEY REACHED A WATERFALL WHERE THE BECK FELL OVER SOME ROCKS INTO THE BOTTOM THEY SELDOM WENT DOWNWARDS THROUGH THE VILLAGE
I HAVE NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING WHAT ANSWER WAS RETURNED BY MR WORDSWORTH
NOT MUCH BETTER THAN SIGN-PAINTING AS TO MANIPULATION
YOU FIRST POINTED OUT TO ME THAT WAY IN WHICH I AM SO FEEBLY ENDEAVOURING TO TRAVEL AND NOW I CANNOT KEEP YOU BY MY SIDE I MUST PROCEED SORROWFULLY ALONE
WHERE THE SNOW LAY LONG AND LATE ON THE MOORS STRETCHING BLEAKLY AND BARELY FAR UP FROM THE DWELLING WHICH WAS HENCEFORWARD TO BE HER HOME
NO HALF-KNOWLEDGE--NO TRUSTING TO OTHER PEOPLE FOR DECISIONS WHICH SHE COULD MAKE FOR HERSELF
SHE CONTINUED HER OWN STUDIES PRINCIPALLY ATTENDING TO GERMAN AND TO LITERATURE
THEIR UNUSUAL POWERS STIR WITHIN THEM AND INSTEAD OF THE NATURAL LIFE OF PERCEPTION--THE OBJECTIVE AS THE GERMANS CALL IT--THEY BEGIN THE DEEPER LIFE OF REFLECTION--THE SUBJECTIVE
I HAVE GOT LEAVE TO ACCOMPANY YOU FOR A WEEK--AT THE UTMOST A FORTNIGHT--BUT NO MORE
WE HAD A STIRRING MEETING IN THE SCHOOLROOM
MERE BODILY PAIN HOWEVER ACUTE SHE COULD ALWAYS PUT ASIDE
IT HAS BEEN COMMON TO ALL FROM THE CHALDEAN SHEPHERDS--"THE LONELY HERDSMAN STRETCHED ON THE SOFT GRASS THROUGH HALF A SUMMER'S DAY"--THE SOLITARY MONK--TO ALL WHOSE IMPRESSIONS FROM WITHOUT HAVE HAD TIME TO GROW AND VIVIFY IN THE IMAGINATION TILL THEY HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AS ACTUAL PERSONIFICATIONS OR SUPERNATURAL VISIONS TO DOUBT WHICH WOULD BE BLASPHEMY
THINGS THAT NOBODY ELSE CARES FOR ENTER INTO MY MIND AND RANKLE THERE LIKE VENOM
I MUST COME BEFORE SOME ONE FROM WHOSE SENTENCE THERE IS NO APPEAL
I WILL MAKE A QUOTATION FROM MARY'S LETTER REFERRING TO THIS TIME
BUT THE HOLIDAYS WILL COME
A CALM AND EVEN MIND LIKE YOURS CANNOT CONCEIVE THE FEELINGS OF THE SHATTERED WRETCH WHO IS NOW WRITING TO YOU WHEN AFTER WEEKS OF MENTAL AND BODILY ANGUISH NOT TO BE DESCRIBED SOMETHING LIKE PEACE BEGAN TO DAWN AGAIN
YOU WILL BE SURPRISED AT THE DATE OF THIS LETTER
AND IT WAS ONLY TOWARDS THE END OF THE EVENING THAT THE TRAVELLER DISCOVERED FROM HIS COMPANION'S VOLUNTARY CONFESSION THAT HE HAD NEVER SET FOOT IN LONDON AT ALL
AND WHEN SHE CONQUERED HERSELF SHE REMAINED NOT LIKE A VICTOR CALM AND SUPREME ON THE THRONE BUT LIKE A PANTING TORN AND SUFFERING VICTIM
HE DID NOT CANT
MOREOVER THEY DO NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES TO LOCAL HEROES
EMILY THOUGH SO MUCH THE TALLER LEANING ON HER SISTER
AND SUCH A ONE IS HE WHO HAS DEVELOPED THE THEORY OF POETRY AS WELL AS ITS PRACTICE AND BOTH IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CLAIM A PLACE IN THE MEMORY OF A THOUSAND YEARS TO COME
DO NOT THINK THAT I FAIL TO BLAME MYSELF FOR THIS OR THAT I LEAVE ANY MEANS UNEMPLOYED TO CONQUER THIS FEELING
AND THE EXTRACTS I HAVE GIVEN CONVEY THE FIRST IMPRESSION WHICH THE LIFE AT A FOREIGN SCHOOL AND THE POSITION OF THE TWO MISS BRONTES THEREIN MADE UPON AN INTELLIGENT ENGLISH GIRL OF SIXTEEN
BUT WHEN THIS DELICACY BECAME APPARENT IN PALPITATIONS AND SHORTNESS OF BREATHING IT WAS TREATED AS AFFECTATION--AS A PHASE OF IMAGINARY INDISPOSITION WHICH COULD BE DISSIPATED BY A GOOD SCOLDING
THE GENEROUS DOG OWED HER NO GRUDGE
NOW HOWEVER I CAN PERCEIVE THAT YOUR SCRUPLES ARE FOUNDED ON COMMON SENSE
THIS WAS THE FIGURE OF A BIRD DECKED WITH PARTI-COLOURED FEATHERS SO AS TO RESEMBLE A POPINJAY OR PARROT
THIS MAKES THE TASK RATHER ARDUOUS AND COMPELS ME EVERY NOW AND THEN TO INTRODUCE AN ENGLISH WORD WHICH NEARLY PLUCKS THE EYES OUT OF HIS HEAD WHEN HE SEES IT
BOTH THESE WERE GREAT MEN AND THEIR WORKS ARE LIKE THEMSELVES
A LITTLE STRINGENT BUT IT DID ME GOOD IT IS PARTLY BECAUSE I THINK IT SO ADMIRABLE AND PARTLY BECAUSE IT TENDS TO BRING OUT HER CHARACTER AS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING REPLY THAT I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF INSERTING THE FOREGOING EXTRACTS FROM IT
YOU DO NOT SAY THAT WHAT I WRITE IS UTTERLY DESTITUTE OF MERIT
HE HAD ENOUGH OF IRISH BLOOD IN HIM TO MAKE HIS MANNERS FRANK AND GENIAL WITH A KIND OF NATURAL GALLANTRY ABOUT THEM
SHE HAD ONLY BEEN THREE MONTHS AT SCHOOL
THE SIGNATURE WHICH YOU SUSPECTED OF BEING FICTITIOUS IS MY REAL NAME
HE WAS REMAINING IN IT FOR A LONGER TIME THAN HE HAD EVER DONE IN ANY KIND OF EMPLOYMENT BEFORE
THAT TO SPEND THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AT HOME IN SOLITUDE AND WEAK HEALTH WOULD RUIN HER
EMILY AND ANNE HAD SOME KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC
MEDITATIONS WHILE JOURNEYING IN A CANADIAN FOREST
I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS SUCH A VIOLENT CONTEST RESPECTING THE CHOICE OF A PASTOR ABOUT THIS TIME IN THE UPPER CHAPEL AT HECKMONDWIKE THAT THE RIOT ACT HAD TO BE READ AT A CHURCH-MEETING CERTAINLY THE SOI-DISANT CHRISTIANS WHO FORCIBLY EJECTED MR REDHEAD AT HAWORTH TEN OR TWELVE YEARS BEFORE HELD A VERY HEATHEN BROTHERHOOD WITH THE SOI-DISANT CHRISTIANS OF HECKMONDWIKE
THERE WAS VIOLENT OPPOSITION WHICH SET MR C.'S IRISH BLOOD IN A FERMENT AND IF PAPA HAD NOT KEPT HIM QUIET PARTLY BY PERSUASION AND PARTLY BY COMPULSION HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE DISSENTERS THEIR KALE THROUGH THE REEK--A SCOTCH PROVERB WHICH I WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU ANOTHER TIME
DRESSED-UP GHOSTS HAD BECOME COMMON AND SHE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM SO THE BLANKET EXERCISE WAS TO BE THE NEXT MODE OF HARDENING HER NERVES
BUT I DO NOT THINK THEY EVER FREELY LOVED HER
HE THEN BECAME A TUTOR IN THE FAMILY OF THE REV
MOREOVER I WAS AWARE THAT HE KNEW SO LITTLE OF ME HE COULD HARDLY BE CONSCIOUS TO WHOM HE WAS WRITING
I CANNOT THINK THAT EVEN THE VERY BEST LINES WILL CONTINUE FOR MANY YEARS AT THEIR PRESENT PREMIUMS
SHE HAD RENDERED HERSELF SO VALUABLE IN HER DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT HER EMPLOYERS VEHEMENTLY URGED HER TO RETURN ALTHOUGH SHE HAD ANNOUNCED HER RESOLUTION TO LEAVE THEM
BUT THEY BURST OUT SOMETIMES AND THEN THOSE WHO SEE THE EXPLOSION DESPISE ME AND I HATE MYSELF FOR DAYS AFTERWARDS I HAVE JUST RECEIVED YOUR EPISTLE AND WHAT ACCOMPANIED IT
THE TABLE AND VASE IN THE DESERT A SONG
BUT IF I SHOULD BE ASKED THOUGH I SHOULD FEEL IT A GREAT ACT OF SELF DENIAL TO REFUSE YET I HAVE ALMOST MADE UP MY MIND TO DO SO THOUGH THE SOCIETY OF THE T.'S IS ONE OF THE MOST ROUSING PLEASURES I HAVE EVER KNOWN
AND I THOUGHT WHEN I HEARD OF THE SORROWFUL YEARS SHE HAD PASSED THROUGH THAT IT HAD BEEN THIS THIS PRESSURE OF GRIEF WHICH HAD CRUSHED ALL BUOYANCY OF EXPECTATION OUT OF HER
AND THAT THE SAD SIGHING GALE WAS MOURNING ABOVE HER BURIED HEAD
AND I HAVE WRITTEN TO MISS W
MISS W TOOK HER ASIDE AND TOLD HER SHE WAS AFRAID THAT SHE MUST PLACE HER IN THE SECOND CLASS FOR SOME TIME TILL SHE COULD OVERTAKE THE GIRLS OF HER OWN AGE IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF GRAMMAR C
THEN WE WALK TILL DINNER-TIME
THANK YOU FOR THE VERY PRETTY LITTLE PURSE YOU HAVE SENT ME
IN THE SUMMER OF 1833 SHE WROTE TO INVITE HER FRIEND TO COME AND PAY HER A VISIT
WHAT EYESIGHT SHE HAD TO SPARE SHE RESERVED FOR THE USE OF HER FATHER
SHE COULD NOT HELP IT NOR HELP THINKING
THE LESS YOU AIM AT THAT THE MORE LIKELY YOU WILL BE TO DESERVE AND FINALLY TO OBTAIN IT
AND ON THAT DREADFUL NIGHT HEARING AS SHE THOUGHT STEPS APPROACHING SHE SNATCHED UP HER TWO INFANT CHILDREN AND PUT THEM IN A BASKET UP THE GREAT CHIMNEY COMMON IN OLD-FASHIONED YORKSHIRE HOUSES
I GATHER SOME OF THESE PARTICULARS FROM A COPY OF A LETTER APPARENTLY IN REPLY TO ONE FROM WORDSWORTH TO WHOM SHE HAD SENT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE STORY SOMETIME IN THE SUMMER OF 1840
BAKED AND BOILED BEEF AND MUTTON POTATO-PIE AND PLAIN HOMELY PUDDINGS OF DIFFERENT KINDS FOR DINNER
NO DESCRIPTION WILL GIVE SO GOOD AN IDEA OF THE EXTREME MINUTENESS OF THE WRITING AS THE ANNEXED FACSIMILE OF A PAGE
I MIGHT HAVE SPARED MYSELF THE TROUBLE AS HE TOOK NO NOTICE AND MADE NO REPLY
THE LOVERS HAD NOT MUCH MONEY TO SPEND IN UNNECESSARY TRAVELLING AND AS MISS BRANWELL HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER LIVING IT APPEARED BOTH A DISCREET AND SEEMLY ARRANGEMENT THAT THE MARRIAGE SHOULD TAKE PLACE FROM HER UNCLE'S HOUSE
BY TURNS GENTLE AND RATTLING
HE THEN QUESTIONED RICHARD WHETHER HE HAD COME AFTER BETTY
IN HIS PRESENT STATE IT IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE TO STAY IN THE ROOM WHERE HE IS
I COULD LIKE TO BE AT HOME
THEN SHE HAD EMILY FOR A DAILY AND NIGHTLY SOLACE AND COMPANION
C'EST LA FRANCE QU'IL AIME LEUR UNION ENFANTE LA PERTE DE L'EUROPE
AT LEAST CHOSE TO BEGIN IT ONCE
TEN TO ONE I SHALL NEVER HAVE THE CHANCE AGAIN
BUT A YEAR OR SO BEFORE THIS TIME A SCHOOL HAD BEEN BEGUN IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND FOR THE DAUGHTERS OF CLERGYMEN
BUT I LIKE THAT STATE OF THINGS
THEY HAD LIKEWISE ATTEMPTED TO WRITE POETRY
7
7
IF I CAN BUT FEEL THAT I AM GIVING SATISFACTION AND IF AT THE SAME TIME I CAN KEEP MY HEALTH I SHALL I HOPE BE MODERATELY HAPPY
THEY ALL OF THEM MADE OUT PERPETUALLY
CAN YOU GIVE ME ANY HINT AS TO THE WAY IN WHICH THESE DIFFICULTIES ARE BEST MET
AND LOOK DOWN UPON A LONG GREEN SLOPE OF PASTURE-LAND ENDING IN THE PLEASANT WOODS OF KIRKLEES SIR GEORGE ARMITAGE'S PARK
FOR HISTORY READ HUME ROLLIN AND THE UNIVERSAL HISTORY IF YOU CAN
THERE IS A STORY CURRENT THAT ONCE IN A PASSION HE SHOT HIS WIFE'S FAVOURITE HORSE AND BURIED IT NEAR A QUARRY WHERE THE GROUND SOME YEARS AFTER MIRACULOUSLY OPENED AND DISPLAYED THE SKELETON
I HAVE HEARD NOTHING OF MISS W YET SINCE I WROTE TO HER INTIMATING THAT I WOULD ACCEPT HER OFFER
SAFETY HEALTH HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY TO YOU PAPA AND TABBY
AND HER EDUCATION DID NOT ENTITLE HER TO A LARGER
TO DEPRIVE THEM OF ONE OF THESE IS CRUEL
THE PRACTICAL QUALITIES OF A MAN ARE HELD IN GREAT RESPECT
NO TIME WAS THERE TO FETCH STICK OR ROD FOR FEAR OF THE STRANGLING CLUTCH AT HER THROAT--HER BARE CLENCHED FIST STRUCK AGAINST HIS RED FIERCE EYES BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO MAKE HIS SPRING AND IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE TURF SHE PUNISHED HIM TILL HIS EYES WERE SWELLED UP AND THE HALF-BLIND STUPIFIED BEAST WAS LED TO HIS ACCUSTOMED LAIR TO HAVE HIS SWOLLEN HEAD FOMENTED AND CARED FOR BY THE VERY EMILY HERSELF
AND NOT THE LEAST AND BEST-LOVED WAS--LIBERTY
THIS IS SUNDAY MORNING
IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE WOMANLY CONSCIENCES OF THESE TWO CORRESPONDENTS WERE ANXIOUSLY ALIVE TO MANY QUESTIONS DISCUSSED AMONG THE STRICTER RELIGIONISTS
I FIND IT IS NOT IN MY NATURE TO GET ON IN THIS WEARY WORLD WITHOUT SYMPATHY AND ATTACHMENT IN SOME QUARTER
PATRICK BRANWELL THEIR ONLY BROTHER WAS A BOY OF REMARKABLE PROMISE AND IN SOME WAYS OF EXTRAORDINARY PRECOCITY OF TALENT
IT GRIEVED ME SO MUCH TO GRIEVE HIM WHO HAS BEEN SO TRUE KIND AND DISINTERESTED A FRIEND
B YOU SEE IS TRIUMPHANT
THE IDEA OF HER FRIEND'S VISIT SEEMS TO HAVE STIRRED CHARLOTTE STRANGELY
AND IT WAS SOME YEARS BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT OF SENDING HER FROM HOME WAS AGAIN VENTURED ON THIS PHYSICAL SUFFERING ON EMILY'S PART WHEN ABSENT FROM HAWORTH AFTER RECURRING SEVERAL TIMES UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES BECAME AT LENGTH SO MUCH AN ACKNOWLEDGED FACT THAT WHICHEVER WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE HOME THE SISTERS DECIDED THAT EMILY MUST REMAIN THERE WHERE ALONE SHE COULD ENJOY ANYTHING LIKE GOOD HEALTH
SO HIS CHARACTER FOR PRUDENCE AND JUDGMENT WAS TO A CERTAIN DEGREE IMPLICATED IN THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF COWAN BRIDGE SCHOOL
IN THE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS LEFT TO HER SELECTION SHE FREQUENTLY TOOK CHARACTERS AND SCENES FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT WITH WHICH ALL HER WRITINGS SHOW THAT SHE WAS ESPECIALLY FAMILIAR
YEARS AFTERWARDS WHEN MISS BRONTE CAME TO STAY WITH US SHE WATCHED OUR LITTLE GIRLS PERPETUALLY
BUT THE OPPOSITION IS DIVIDED RED HOTS AND LUKE-WARMS
IN THE THIRD THERE WERE FROM TWENTY TO THIRTY PUPILS
MR AND MRS
I KNEW ONLY TOO WELL
AND THIS PATH STEADILY FOLLOWED WILL LEAD I BELIEVE IN TIME TO PROSPERITY AND TO HAPPINESS THOUGH IT MAY SEEM AT THE OUTSET TO TEND QUITE IN A CONTRARY DIRECTION
WE TAKE TWO AND SEE THREE NEWSPAPERS A WEEK
LINES WRITTEN ON THE BANK OF A RIVER ONE FINE SUMMER EVENING
SOME YEARS AFTERWARDS I TOLD HER I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN VERY IMPERTINENT
ALL THIS OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AND IN ESTIMATING ITS EFFECT UPON THE CHARACTER OF CHARLOTTE BRONTE WE MUST REMEMBER THAT SHE WAS A SENSITIVE THOUGHTFUL CHILD CAPABLE OF REFLECTING DEEPLY IF NOT OF ANALYZING TRULY
MARY SAYS:--"SHE VISITED US TWICE OR THRICE WHEN SHE WAS AT MISS W---'S
AND IT IS REMARKABLE HOW DEEPLY HIS POEMS IMPRESSED HER
BUT AFTER I HAD THOUGHT A LITTLE AND READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN THE PROSPECT SEEMED TO CLEAR
MADAME HEGER ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WAS NOT MERELY A ROMAN CATHOLIC SHE WAS DEVOTE

YOU KINDLY ALLOW ME TO WRITE POETRY FOR ITS OWN SAKE PROVIDED I LEAVE UNDONE NOTHING WHICH I OUGHT TO DO IN ORDER TO PURSUE THAT SINGLE ABSORBING EXQUISITE GRATIFICATION
A PIECE OF OAT-CAKE FOR THOSE WHO REQUIRED LUNCHEON
YOU WILL NOT SEEK IN IMAGINATION FOR EXCITEMENT OF WHICH THE VICISSITUDES OF THIS LIFE AND THE ANXIETIES FROM WHICH YOU MUST NOT HOPE TO BE EXEMPTED BE YOUR STATE WHAT IT MAY WILL BRING WITH THEM BUT TOO MUCH

BUT LEFT TO EACH OTHER'S SOLE COMPANIONSHIP CHARLOTTE SOON DISCOVERED THAT HER ASSOCIATE WAS MORE PROFLIGATE MORE STEEPED IN A KIND OF COLD SYSTEMATIC SENSUALITY THAN SHE HAD BEFORE IMAGINED IT POSSIBLE FOR A HUMAN BEING TO BE
THE FIRST IS DATED JANUARY 28TH 1846 AND IN IT SHE INQUIRES IF THEY WILL PUBLISH ONE VOLUME OCTAVO OF POEMS
AND WAS MOREOVER NO LONGER REGARDED WITH THE FORMER KINDLINESS OF FEELING BY MADAME HEGER
THE BAD MANAGEMENT OF THE COOK WAS CHIEFLY TO BE BLAMED FOR THIS
THIS ARTICLE IS A SMALL PROSE TALE OR INCIDENT

THERE IS MONOTONY AND UNIFORMITY OF LIFE
IT IS ON PAPA'S ACCOUNT

THE SWISS ARTIST A TALE
HOW FAR IS IT FROM LEEDS TO SHEFFIELD
ON READING OVER FOR THE SECOND OR THIRD TIME YOUR LAST LETTER WHICH BY THE BY WAS WRITTEN IN SUCH HIEROGLYPHICS THAT AT THE FIRST HASTY PERUSAL I COULD HARDLY MAKE OUT TWO CONSECUTIVE WORDS I FIND YOU INTIMATE THAT IF I LEAVE THIS JOURNEY TILL THURSDAY I SHALL BE TOO LATE
NO DOUBT IF I HAD GONE ON I SHOULD HAVE MADE QUITE A RICHARDSONIAN CONCERN OF IT I HAD MATERIALS IN MY HEAD FOR HALF A-DOZEN VOLUMES OF COURSE IT IS WITH CONSIDERABLE REGRET I RELINQUISH ANY SCHEME SO CHARMING AS THE ONE I HAVE SKETCHED
SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THIS GENTLEMAN AND HIS WIFE TO LIVE WITH THEM AS THEIR ADOPTED CHILD PERHAPS ABOUT FIVE-AND-TWENTY YEARS BEFORE THE TIME OF WHICH I AM WRITING
VOLUME OF VERSE IN MY SISTER EMILY'S HANDWRITING
THE HOPES AND PLANS THEY HAD CHERISHED LONG AND LABOURED HARD TO FULFIL WERE CRUELLY FRUSTRATED
AT THAT TIME WHEN OUR COLONIAL POSSESSIONS WERE VERY LIMITED OUR ARMY AND NAVY ON A SMALL SCALE AND THERE WAS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE DEMAND FOR INTELLECT THE YOUNGER SONS OF GENTLEMEN WERE OFTEN OF NECESSITY BROUGHT UP TO SOME TRADE OR MECHANICAL ART TO WHICH NO DISCREDIT OR LOSS OF CASTE AS IT WERE WAS ATTACHED
PARTOUT IL SE SOUSTRAIT A L'ELOGE
GREY STONE ABOUNDS
AN EXACT PUNCTUALITY AND OBEDIENCE TO THE LAWS OF TIME AND PLACE OF WHICH NO ONE BUT THEMSELVES I HAVE HEARD CHARLOTTE SAY COULD TELL THE VALUE IN AFTER-LIFE
HEGER HAD NO TIME
BUT THE OAKWELL PROPERTY PASSED OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE BATTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST CENTURY
I HAVE STRIVEN HARD TO BE PLEASED WITH MY NEW SITUATION
MOST LIKELY CHARLOTTE BRONTE IN COMING FROM HAWORTH CAME THE GREATEST DISTANCE OF ALL
HER CHILDHOOD WAS NO CHILDHOOD
JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF 1837 HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM SOUTHEY
A LEVY WAS MADE ON THE HORSES OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND A MERRY CAVALCADE OF MOUNTED MEN AND WOMEN SINGLE OR DOUBLE TRAVERSED THE WAY TO BRADFORD CHURCH
BECAUSE IT WAS A REAL CRAVING OF NATURE
AND HER DAUGHTER WAS EQUALLY STRUCK BY THE RESEMBLANCE
WHILE AS HAVING A CHARACTER OF THEIR OWN--EARNEST WILD AND OCCASIONALLY FANATICAL--MAY BE NAMED SOME OF THE BOOKS WHICH CAME FROM THE BRANWELL SIDE OF THE FAMILY--FROM THE CORNISH FOLLOWERS OF THE SAINTLY JOHN WESLEY--AND WHICH ARE TOUCHED ON IN THE ACCOUNT OF THE WORKS TO WHICH CAROLINE HELSTONE HAD ACCESS IN SHIRLEY:"--"SOME VENERABLE LADY'S MAGAZINES THAT HAD ONCE PERFORMED A VOYAGE WITH THEIR OWNER AND UNDERGONE A STORM"--(POSSIBLY PART OF THE RELICS OF MRS BRONTE'S POSSESSIONS CONTAINED IN THE SHIP WRECKED ON THE COAST OF CORNWALL)--"AND WHOSE PAGES WERE STAINED WITH SALT WATER
ALL THE WAVES OF THE CHANNEL HEAVING AND ROARING BETWEEN MUST DEADEN THE SOUND FROM THE TONE OF THIS LETTER IT MAY EASILY BE PERCEIVED THAT THE BRUSSELS OF 1843 WAS A DIFFERENT PLACE FROM THAT OF 1842
AND TO YOU RATHER IN A LETTER THAN VIVA VOCE
TWINGES OF HOME-SICKNESS CUT ME TO THE HEART EVERY NOW AND THEN
THE ROYAL DUKES IN THEIR ROBES AND THE GREAT DUKE IN GREEN SASH AND WAISTCOAT
JUDGING FROM HUMAN NATURE I THOUGHT THAT A LITTLE COUNTRY GIRL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A SITUATION SO WELL CALCULATED TO EXCITE CURIOSITY AND TO DISTRACT ATTENTION WOULD LOSE ALL REMEMBRANCE FOR A TIME AT LEAST OF DISTANT AND FAMILIAR OBJECTS AND GIVE HERSELF UP ENTIRELY TO THE FASCINATION OF THOSE SCENES WHICH WERE THEN PRESENTED TO HER VIEW
THE FACT IS AN EXCURSION WITH YOU ANYWHERE,--WHETHER TO CLEATHORPE OR CANADA,--JUST BY OURSELVES WOULD BE TO ME MOST DELIGHTFUL
AND NO WONDER WHEN STONE QUARRIES ARE NEAR AND TREES ARE FAR TO SEEK
AND HAPPENING TO HAVE A MASK IN THE HOUSE I TOLD THEM ALL TO STAND AND SPEAK BOLDLY FROM UNDER COVER OF THE MASK
BRONTE A.B MINISTER OF HAWORTH SHE DIED SEPT
JUNE 1841
SHE MISSED THE SMALL ROUND OF CHEERFUL SOCIAL VISITING PERPETUALLY GOING ON IN A COUNTRY TOWN
HEGER HIMSELF WOULD COME IN AND SUBSTITUTE A BOOK OF A DIFFERENT AND MORE INTERESTING KIND

ALLUDED TO IN THIS LETTER AS IN WANT OF A GOVERNESS ENTERED INTO A CORRESPONDENCE WITH MISS BRONTE AND EXPRESSED HERSELF MUCH PLEASED WITH THE LETTERS SHE RECEIVED FROM HER WITH THE STYLE AND CANDOUR OF THE APPLICATION IN WHICH CHARLOTTE HAD TAKEN CARE TO TELL HER THAT IF SHE WANTED A SHOWY ELEGANT OR FASHIONABLE PERSON HER CORRESPONDENT WAS NOT FITTED FOR SUCH A SITUATION
THEY WERE MERRY AND SOCIAL BUT THEY EACH KNEW THAT A GAP NEVER TO BE FILLED HAD BEEN MADE IN THEIR CIRCLE
IN A WORD SHE IS A MARRIED INSTEAD OF A MAIDEN LADY
BUT I DO BETTER NOW
A GLIMPSE OF WHAT I FELT I SHOWED TO YOU IN ONE OF MY FORMER LETTERS--ONLY A GLIMPSE
MAIS A PRESENT J'AI LA VUE TROP FAIBLE
LATELY
FEW CONTAINING POSITIVE FACTS
STILL HE WAS ASSOCIATED IN MANY OF HIS SISTERS PLAYS AND AMUSEMENTS
IT IS SO HARD TO FEEL THAT HIS FEW AND SCANTY PLEASURES MUST ALL SOON GO
CONCLUDED HER ACCOUNT BY SAYING HE WAS A HOPELESS BEING IT IS TOO TRUE
THIS IS AN AUTUMN EVENING WET AND WILD
IT IS EVIDENT THAT UNKNOWN AUTHORS HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTIES TO CONTEND WITH BEFORE THEY CAN SUCCEED IN BRINGING THEIR WORKS BEFORE THE PUBLIC

SHE STATES IN ADDITION THAT IT IS NOT THEIR INTENTION TO PUBLISH THESE TALES ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT
AND THE COUNTRY PEOPLE STEALING INTO THE FIELDS SURROUNDING HEALD'S HALL ON DUSKY WINTER EVENINGS YEARS AFTER THIS TIME DECLARED THAT THROUGH THE WINDOWS THEY SAW PARSON ROBERSON DANCING IN A STRANGE RED LIGHT WITH BLACK DEMONS ALL WHIRLING AND EDDYING ROUND HIM
THE EDITOR IS MR CHRISTOPHER NORTH AN OLD MAN SEVENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE
HERE IS THE PLACE
THE CROOKED MOUTH AND THE LARGE NOSE WERE FORGOTTEN AND THE WHOLE FACE ARRESTED THE ATTENTION AND PRESENTLY ATTRACTED ALL THOSE WHOM SHE HERSELF WOULD HAVE CARED TO ATTRACT
BUT I MUST RETAIN IT NOTWITHSTANDING FOOTNOTES
I AM AGAIN BY MYSELF--HOUSEKEEPER AND GOVERNESS--FOR MR AND MRS
JUST WHERE THE LECK-FELLS SWOOP INTO THE PLAIN
THOUGH I NEVER HAD ANY SCHOOL EDUCATION I NEVER FELT THE WANT OF IT IN HER COMPANY THE PUBLISHERS TO WHOM SHE FINALLY MADE A SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CURRER ELLIS AND ACTON BELL'S POEMS WERE MESSRS
PREPARE FOR A HEARTY LAUGH
WE HAD A RAGE FOR PRACTICALITY AND LAUGHED ALL POETRY TO SCORN
THERE WAS THE SAME CARELESSNESS IN MAKING THE PUDDINGS
YOU WILL NEITHER DOUBT MY SINCERITY NOR MY GOOD WILL
FOR EMILY HAD TAKEN A FANCY TO THE FASHION UGLY AND PREPOSTEROUS EVEN DURING ITS REIGN OF GIGOT SLEVES AND PERSISTED IN WEARING THEM LONG AFTER THEY WERE GONE OUT HER PETTICOATS TOO HAD NOT A CURVE OR A WAVE IN THEM BUT HUNG DOWN STRAIGHT AND LONG CLINGING TO HER LANK FIGURE
FOR WE HAVE SEEN HOW SHE YEARNED FOR HER FRIEND'S COMPANY
SHAKING MY HAIR FROM MY EYES I LIFTED MY HEAD AND TRIED TO LOOK BOLDLY THROUGH THE DARK ROOM
IN THAT CAPACITY I FIND ENOUGH TO OCCUPY MY THOUGHTS ALL DAY LONG AND MY HEAD AND HANDS TOO WITHOUT HAVING A MOMENT'S TIME FOR ONE DREAM OF THE IMAGINATION

I WENT INTO THE ROOM WHERE BRANWELL WAS TO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER I GOT HOME
THEY GET ON WITH WONDERFUL RAPIDITY
THE VILLAGE OF GOMERSALL WHERE CHARLOTTE BRONTE'S FRIEND MARY LIVED WITH HER FAMILY WHICH WAS A MUCH PRETTIER PLACE THAN HECKMONDWIKE CONTAINED A STRANGE-LOOKING COTTAGE BUILT OF ROUGH UNHEWN STONES MANY OF THEM PROJECTING CONSIDERABLY WITH UNCOUTH HEADS AND GRINNING FACES CARVED UPON THEM
HALF TO BE PAID IN ADVANCE WHEN THE PUPILS ARE SENT
I BELIEVE FROM AN EXPRESSION IN A LETTER TO BE NOTICED HEREAFTER THAT SHE ALSO CONSULTED COLERIDGE
TWO PATHS LIE BEFORE YOU
I USED TO BELIEVE THEM TO HAVE BEEN WONDERS OF TALENT AND KINDNESS
I WROTE ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS I SPOKE--OUT OF THE IMPULSE AND FEELINGS OF THE MIND
THEY AGREE WITH YOU THAT SINCE THE SEASON IS UNFAVOURABLE ADVERTISING HAD BETTER BE DEFERRED
HE DOES HIS BEST--THE POOR OLD MAN
FROM THEIR PECULIAR PAROCHIAL POSITION AND CIRCUMSTANCES THE INHABITANTS OF THE CHAPELRY HAVE BEEN PROMPT EARNEST AND PERSEVERING IN THEIR OPPOSITION TO CHURCH-RATES
THESE ARE MERELY INSTANCES OF ECCENTRICITY COMPARED TO THE TALES OF POSITIVE VIOLENCE AND CRIME THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THESE ISOLATED DWELLINGS WHICH STILL LINGER IN THE MEMORIES OF THE OLD PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT AND SOME OF WHICH WERE DOUBTLESS FAMILIAR TO THE AUTHORS OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS AND THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL THE AMUSEMENTS OF THE LOWER CLASSES COULD HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO BE MORE HUMANE THAN THOSE OF THE WEALTHY AND BETTER EDUCATED
HERE ALSO LIE THE REMAINS OF PATRICK BRANWELL BRONTE WHO DIED SEPT
THE MOMENT SHE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE FRONTISPIECE THERE SHE IS IN A MINUTE SHE EXCLAIMED
ADDING THAT THE THING SEEMED TO HIM INEXPLICABLE
I AM SLOW VERY SLOW TO BELIEVE THE PROTESTATIONS OF ANOTHER
THE AREA OF THIS OBLONG IS FILLED UP BY A CROWDED CHURCHYARD AND A SMALL GARDEN OR COURT IN FRONT OF THE CLERGYMAN'S HOUSE
IF YOU KNEW HOW WELCOME YOUR LETTERS ARE YOU WOULD WRITE VERY OFTEN
THEY SAY MOREOVER THAT THE LOAN OF 100_L WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN SO KIND AS TO OFFER US WILL PERHAPS NOT BE ALL REQUIRED NOW AS MISS W WILL LEND US THE FURNITURE

AND WAS SO SUCCESSFUL IN HIS ACUTE UNFLINCHING ENERGY THAT IT WAS BELIEVED HE HAD BEEN SUPERNATURALLY AIDED
IT WAS PROPER FOR THEM TO DO IT SHE SAID
YET I FEEL AT THE SAME TIME THAT I AM MAKING A VERY FOOLISH AND ALMOST IMPRACTICABLE DEMAND
SO DO I
IT MAY BE MADE THE SUREST MEANS NEXT TO RELIGION OF SOOTHING THE MIND AND ELEVATING IT
BUT THE TREATMENT WHICH SHE FELT AS A REAL CRUELTY WAS THIS
TO SOME CHILDREN OATMEAL PORRIDGE IS DISTASTEFUL AND CONSEQUENTLY UNWHOLESOME EVEN WHEN PROPERLY MADE
COULD I MEET YOU AT LEEDS
IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK WHEN SHE REACHED THE PARSONAGE
SHE RESOLVED TO FOLLOW THE CLUE AND NEVER TO REST TILL SHE HAD REACHED A SUCCESSFUL ISSUE
TWO FRAGMENTS NAMELY 1ST THE VISION
WITH OLDER GIRLS VERGING ON WOMANHOOD THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER ESPECIALLY IF THESE HAD ANY DESIRE FOR IMPROVEMENT
MR BRONTE WAS SOON CAPTIVATED BY THE LITTLE GENTLE CREATURE AND THIS TIME DECLARED THAT IT WAS FOR LIFE
HOWEVER MONOTONOUS AND TRYING WERE THE DUTIES CHARLOTTE HAD TO PERFORM UNDER HER ROOF THERE WAS ALWAYS A GENIAL AND THOUGHTFUL FRIEND WATCHING OVER HER AND URGING HER TO PARTAKE OF ANY LITTLE PIECE OF INNOCENT RECREATION THAT MIGHT COME IN HER WAY
MR AND MRS BRANWELL WOULD BE LIVING--THEIR FAMILY OF FOUR DAUGHTERS AND ONE SON STILL CHILDREN--DURING THE EXISTENCE OF THAT PRIMITIVE STATE OF SOCIETY WHICH IS WELL DESCRIBED BY DR DAVY IN THE LIFE OF HIS BROTHER
AT LENGTH SHE WAS SEEING SOMEWHAT OF THAT GRAND OLD WORLD OF WHICH SHE HAD DREAMED
56 57
AS I WRITE I HAVE BEFORE ME HIS LAST WORDS ON GIVING UP THE SECRETARYSHIP IN 1850
THE EVANGELICAL ALLIANCE PART IS NOT VERY PRACTICABLE YET CERTAINLY IT IS MORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL TO PREACH UNITY AMONG CHRISTIANS THAN TO INCULCATE MUTUAL INTOLERANCE AND HATRED
HE CAME FROM THE SOUTH TO THE NORTH OF THE ISLAND AND SETTLED IN THE PARISH OF AHADERG NEAR LOUGHBRICKLAND
AND MANY OF THOSE WHO KNEW HIM AT THAT TIME ASSURE ME OF THE FIDELITY WITH WHICH THIS IS REPRESENTED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THEY REGRET THAT THE DELINEATION SHOULD HAVE OBLITERATED AS IT WERE NEARLY ALL THAT WAS NOBLE OR CONSCIENTIOUS
AND THAT IT MAY GIVE AUNT PLEASANT REMINISCENCES OF THE SALUBRIOUS CLIMATE OF HER NATIVE PLACE C
IT IS PRETTILY SITUATED
I AM NOT TOO MUCH OVERLOADED WITH OCCUPATION

BUT INSTIGATED BY HIS BROTHER HE BEGAN THROWING STONES AT HER AND ONE OF THEM HIT HER SO SEVERE A BLOW ON THE TEMPLE THAT THE LADS WERE ALARMED INTO OBEDIENCE
I ALWAYS FEEL A PECULIAR SATISFACTION WHEN I HEAR OF YOUR ENJOYING YOURSELF BECAUSE IT PROVES THAT THERE REALLY IS SUCH A THING AS RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE EVEN IN THIS WORLD
NOR CAN WORDSWORTH'S NOR CAMPBELL'S NOR SOUTHEY'S--THE GREATEST PART AT LEAST OF HIS
FOR SOME TIME BEFORE HIS DEATH HE HAD ATTACKS OF DELIRIUM TREMENS OF THE MOST FRIGHTFUL CHARACTER
SHE HAD THE WEEKLY VARIETY OF A VISIT TO THE FAMILY OF THE D.S

SOMETIMES I ASK MYSELF HOW LONG SHALL I STAY HERE

BUT ONE MORE OF THAT GENERATION--THE LAST OF THAT NURSERY OF SIX LITTLE MOTHERLESS CHILDREN--WAS YET TO FOLLOW BEFORE THE SURVIVOR THE CHILDLESS AND WIDOWED FATHER FOUND HIS REST
BUT THIS SURMOUNTED THE CHURCH LIES A LITTLE OFF THE MAIN ROAD ON THE LEFT
BUT IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY IT BECAME NECESSARY TO CONSTRUCT A STREET THROUGH THE EXERCISE-GROUND OF THE ARBALETRIERS DU GRAND SERMENT AND AFTER MUCH DELAY THE COMPANY WERE INDUCED BY THE BELOVED INFANTA ISABELLA TO GIVE UP THE REQUISITE PLOT OF GROUND
IT IS BUT THAT DISTANCE FROM THE BUSY WHIRR OF THE STEAM-ENGINES EMPLOYED IN THE WOOLLEN MILLS AT BIRSTALL
THE FOURTEEN NAMES ARE GIVEN DOUBTLESS MIGHTY MEN OF YORE BUT AMONG THEM ALL SIR FLETCHER NORTON ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND MAJOR-GENERAL BIRCH WERE THE ONLY ONES WITH WHICH I HAD ANY ASSOCIATION IN 1855
A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD KINDLY INTERESTED HIMSELF IN THE PREPARATION OF THIS MEMOIR TOOK THE FIRST VOLUME SHORTLY AFTER THE PUBLICATION TO THE HOUSE OF THIS OLD SERVANT IN ORDER TO SHOW HER THE PORTRAIT
THERE WAS NO REASON EITHER WHY THE ENGAGEMENT SHOULD BE PROLONGED
IT DOES NOT FLOURISH IT MERELY EXISTS
SHE REPLIED YOU DID ME A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD POLLY SO DON'T REPENT OF IT SHE USED TO DRAW MUCH BETTER AND MORE QUICKLY THAN ANYTHING WE HAD SEEN BEFORE AND KNEW MUCH ABOUT CELEBRATED PICTURES AND PAINTERS
BUT AGAINST THE FURY OF HUNDREDS HE HAD ONLY FOUR OF HIS OWN WORKMEN AND FIVE SOLDIERS TO ASSIST HIM
THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF LONDON
MENTION THE WEEK AND THE DAY
THEN HE WOULD MAKE THEM READ GUIZOT AND SEE HOW IN THIS VIEW CROMWELL WAS ENDOWED WITH THE UTMOST POWER OF FREE-WILL BUT GOVERNED BY NO HIGHER MOTIVE THAN THAT OF EXPEDIENCY
THAT WAS ALWAYS A PLEASURE AT THIS TIME
HE BELONGS TO THAT KEEN YET SHORT-SIGHTED CLASS WHO CONSIDER SUSPICION OF ALL WHOSE HONESTY IS NOT PROVED AS A SIGN OF WISDOM
EXPECTED A GOOD DEAL OF SEWING FROM ME
A TRUE STORY CONTINUED
SHE PROMISED TO SHOW ME SOME OF THESE MAGAZINES BUT RETRACTED IT AFTERWARDS AND WOULD NEVER BE PERSUADED TO DO SO
THEY WERE GOOD LIKENESSES HOWEVER BADLY EXECUTED
CHARLOTTE WRITES ON THE SUBJECT IN THE EARLY WINTER MONTHS TO THIS EFFECT I EMILY AND ANNE ARE TRULY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THE EFFORTS YOU HAVE MADE IN OUR BEHALF

C'EST FOULER AUX PIEDS LE VAINCU
BUT DUTY--NECESSITY--THESE ARE STERN MISTRESSES WHO WILL NOT BE DISOBEYED
MR WILSON HIMSELF ORDERED IN THE FOOD AND WAS ANXIOUS THAT IT SHOULD BE OF GOOD QUALITY
A BEREAVEMENT OF THIS KIND GIVES ONE A GLIMPSE OF THE FEELING THOSE MUST HAVE WHO HAVE SEEN ALL DROP ROUND THEM FRIEND AFTER FRIEND AND ARE LEFT TO END THEIR PILGRIMAGE ALONE
SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL--OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR IN IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
BUT AS HER DEFINITE ACQUIREMENTS WERE FEW SHE HAD TO EKE THEM OUT BY EMPLOYING HER LEISURE TIME IN NEEDLEWORK
AND SHE TOO DIED IN THE EARLY SUMMER OF THAT YEAR
ARE STAYING AT TO SPEAK TRUTH THOUGH I AM SOLITARY WHILE THEY ARE AWAY IT IS STILL BY FAR THE HAPPIEST PART OF MY TIME
YOU ASK ME IF I DO NOT THINK THAT MEN ARE STRANGE BEINGS
AND MADAME HEGER AGREED THAT IT WOULD BE FOR THE BEST WHEN THEY LEARNT ONLY THAT PART OF THE CASE WHICH SHE COULD REVEAL TO THEM--NAMELY MR BRONTE'S INCREASING BLINDNESS
SHE ALSO DOUBTED THE SUCCESS OF THE PLAN
HE HAD A LONG ILLNESS WHICH RENDERED HIM UNABLE TO DISCHARGE HIS DUTIES WITHOUT ASSISTANCE AND MR REDHEAD GAVE HIM OCCASIONAL HELP TO THE GREAT SATISFACTION OF THE PARISHIONERS AND WAS HIGHLY RESPECTED BY THEM DURING MR CHARNOCK'S LIFETIME
HELENE
HELENE
AT CERTAIN EARLY HOURS THEY HAD THEIR MEALS
THE SAME SUFFERING AND CONFLICT ENSUED HEIGHTENED BY THE STRONG RECOIL OF HER UPRIGHT HERETIC AND ENGLISH SPIRIT FROM THE GENTLE JESUITRY OF THE FOREIGN AND ROMISH SYSTEM
NOT SO HER TWO ELDER SISTERS
HAVE THE KINDNESS ALSO TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUERIES IF YOU CAN
HE WENT HOME FOR HIS HOLIDAYS RELUCTANTLY STAYED THERE AS SHORT A TIME AS POSSIBLE PERPLEXING AND DISTRESSING THEM ALL BY HIS EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT--AT ONE TIME IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS AT ANOTHER IN THE DEEPEST DEPRESSION--ACCUSING HIMSELF OF BLACKEST GUILT AND TREACHERY WITHOUT SPECIFYING WHAT THEY WERE
AND THE REMAINING GIRLS DINED IN THE REFECTOIRE M
IS EXTREMELY KIND
SHE DECLARES THERE IS NOTHING SHE CAN TURN TO AND LAUGHS AT THE IDEA OF DELICACY,--AND SHE IS ONLY TEN YEARS OLDER THAN I AM I DID NOT SEE THE CONNECTION TILL SHE SAID WELL POLLY I SHOULD HATE BEING A SISTER OF CHARITY

AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE METHODISTS AND BAPTISTS REFUSED TO PAY THE CHURCH-RATES

AND IF EVER I MARRY IT MUST BE IN THAT LIGHT OF ADORATION THAT I WILL REGARD MY HUSBAND
A LONG PAUSE SUCCEEDED WHICH WAS AT LAST BROKEN BY BRANWELL SAYING IN A LAZY MANNER I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO THIS WAS ECHOED BY EMILY AND ANNE
THE YOUNG MEN'S PLAY TOOK ITS RISE FROM SOME WOODEN SOLDIERS BRANWELL HAD
AND AFTER THAT THE HAPPY VISION OF BEING TOGETHER AND OPENING A SCHOOL WAS TO BE REALISED
AGREEZ JE VOUS PRIE MONSIEUR L'EXPRESSION RESPECTUEUSE DE MES SENTIMENTS DE HAUTE CONSIDERATION
DO NOT BE OVER-PERSUADED TO MARRY A MAN YOU CAN NEVER RESPECT--I DO NOT SAY LOVE
POUR WELLINGTON L'OPINION PUBLIQUE EST UNE RUMEUR UN RIEN QUE LE SOUFFLE DE SON INFLEXIBLE VOLONTE FAIT DISPARAITRE COMME UNE BULLE DE SAVON
HER DEATH WAS TRANQUIL AND HAPPY IN ROSE'S GUARDIAN ARMS FOR ROSE HAD BEEN HER STAY AND DEFENCE THROUGH MANY TRIALS
AND BOTH ON FATHER'S AND MOTHER'S SIDE THE BRANWELL FAMILY WERE SUFFICIENTLY WELL DESCENDED TO ENABLE THEM TO MIX IN THE BEST SOCIETY THAT PENZANCE THEN AFFORDED
TO-DAY THE WEATHER IS GLARING AND I AM STUPIFIED WITH A BAD COLD AND HEADACHE
WITHIN THE STONE WALL WHICH KEEPS OUT THE SURROUNDING CHURCHYARD ARE BUSHES OF ELDER AND LILAC
FOR THE TORY AND CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER TAKING INTEREST IN POLITICS EVER SINCE SHE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD AND HOLDING FREQUENT DISCUSSIONS WITH SUCH OF THE GIRLS AS WERE DISSENTERS AND RADICALS WAS SURE TO HAVE MADE HERSELF AS MUCH ACQUAINTED AS SHE COULD WITH THE CONDITION OF THOSE TO WHOM SHE WAS OPPOSED IN OPINION
THE EVENING WALK A POEM JUNE 23RD 1830
THERE YOU SIT UPRIGHT AND STILL IN YOUR BLACK DRESS AND WHITE SCARF AND PALE MARBLE-LIKE FACE--JUST LIKE REALITY
AND THOUGH SHE HAD LEFT HER PLACE MANY YEARS AGO ONE OF THESE FORMER SERVANTS WENT OVER FROM BRADFORD TO HAWORTH ON PURPOSE TO SEE MR BRONTE AND OFFER HIM HER TRUE SYMPATHY WHEN HIS LAST CHILD DIED
THE ABUNDANCE OF COAL AND THE NUMBER OF MOUNTAIN STREAMS IN THE DISTRICT MAKE IT HIGHLY FAVOURABLE TO MANUFACTURES
I ONLY WONDER THAT SHE DID NOT REMONSTRATE AGAINST HER FATHER'S DECISION TO SEND HER AND EMILY BACK TO COWAN BRIDGE AFTER MARIA'S AND ELIZABETH'S DEATHS
THEY PUT AWAY THEIR WORK AND BEGAN TO PACE THE ROOM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS UP AND DOWN,--AS OFTEN WITH THE CANDLES EXTINGUISHED FOR ECONOMY'S SAKE AS NOT,--THEIR FIGURES GLANCING INTO THE FIRE-LIGHT AND OUT INTO THE SHADOW PERPETUALLY
SCRAPS OF MEAT FROM A DIRTY AND DISORDERLY LARDER COULD NEVER BE VERY APPETIZING
I AM AFRAID SHE WILL HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF HARD WORK TO DO NOW THAT HANNAH A SERVANT-GIRL WHO HAD BEEN ASSISTING TABBY IS GONE
POSSIBLY TOO THEY HAD BY THIS TIME HEARD DISTRESSING RUMOURS CONCERNING THE CAUSE OF THAT REMORSE AND AGONY OF MIND WHICH AT TIMES MADE HIM RESTLESS AND UNNATURALLY MERRY AT TIMES RENDERED HIM MOODY AND IRRITABLE
MARY AND HER BROTHER WHO WERE EXPERIENCED IN FOREIGN TRAVELLING WERE ALSO OF THE PARTY
BUT THEN IT CROSSES A BRIDGE OVER THE BECK AND THE ASCENT THROUGH THE VILLAGE BEGINS
ONE OF THEIR FELLOW-PUPILS AMONG OTHER STATEMENTS EVEN WORSE GIVES ME THE FOLLOWING:--THE DORMITORY IN WHICH MARIA SLEPT WAS A LONG ROOM HOLDING A ROW OF NARROW LITTLE BEDS ON EACH SIDE OCCUPIED BY THE PUPILS
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SOME OF MY READERS TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE CHARACTER OF HER PURELY IMAGINATIVE WRITING AT THIS PERIOD
FROM ONE TO TWO THERE WAS FANCY WORK--A PUPIL READING ALOUD SOME LIGHT LITERATURE IN EACH ROOM

YOI WAS THE ANSWER

FOR BIOGRAPHY READ JOHNSON'S LIVES OF THE POETS BOSWELL'S LIFE OF JOHNSON SOUTHEY'S LIFE OF NELSON LOCKHART'S LIFE OF BURNS MOORE'S LIFE OF SHERIDAN MOORE'S LIFE OF BYRON WOLFE'S REMAINS
I KNOW WHAT CONCEALED SUSCEPTIBILITY IS IN HER NATURE WHEN HER FEELINGS ARE WOUNDED
C'EST ABUSER DE DROIT DE LA VICTOIRE
IN THIS STATE I HAD CHARGE GIVEN ME OF A SET OF PAMPERED SPOILT TURBULENT CHILDREN WHOM I WAS EXPECTED CONSTANTLY TO AMUSE AS WELL AS TO INSTRUCT
HISPAN
AS ONE EVIDENCE HOW WELLESLEY HAUNTED HER IMAGINATION I COPY OUT A FEW OF THE TITLES TO HER PAPERS IN THE VARIOUS MAGAZINES
SUPERIOR ADVANTAGES MUST BE OFFERED
MOST OF THE PEOPLE WEARING THE WOODEN CLOGS OF THE DISTRICT
NOT THAT THE BOOKS WERE WHAT WOULD GENERALLY BE CALLED NEW
I WON'T PLAY THE HYPOCRITE
FILL IT WITH THE MINUTEST DETAILS
HOWEVER THEY WENT AWAY AND NO MORE WAS THOUGHT ABOUT THEM
THEY HAD A CARRIAGE IN WHICH SHE AND THE FAVOURITE DOG WERE TAKEN AN AIRING ON ALTERNATE DAYS
IN JUNE 1828 WE ERECTED A SCHOOL ON A FICTITIOUS ISLAND WHICH WAS TO CONTAIN 1,000 CHILDREN
MOST TRUE
MR BRONTE CAME AGAIN IN THE SEPTEMBER OF THAT YEAR BRINGING WITH HIM CHARLOTTE AND EMILY TO BE ADMITTED AS PUPILS
AND PECULIARLY SUSCEPTIBLE AS ARE ALL DELICATE AND SICKLY CHILDREN TO PAINFUL IMPRESSIONS
AND HE HAD ONLY JUST TAKEN OUT HIS POLICY WHEN HE FELL ILL OF AN ACUTE DISEASE WHICH WAS CERTAIN TO END FATALLY IN A VERY FEW DAYS
IF I HAD SEEN YOU SHIVERING AS I SHIVERED MYSELF IF I HAD SEEN YOUR HANDS AND FEET AS RED AND SWELLED AS MINE WERE MY DISCOMFORT WOULD JUST HAVE BEEN DOUBLED
AND SO WAS HIS DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE TOO
YET THERE IS NOT ONE HERE TO TELL ME
IMPENETRABLE DEVANT LES MENACES INACCESSIBLE AUX LOUANGES IL SE PRESENTA DEVANT LE CONSEIL DE LA NATION ET LEVANT SON FRONT TRANQUILLE EN HAUT IL OSA DIRE
WE HAVE NO PRESENT INTENTION HOWEVER OF BREAKING OUR HEARTS ON THE SUBJECT STILL LESS OF FEELING MORTIFIED AT DEFEAT
BOTH ARE SPOKEN OF VERY HIGHLY IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND IT IS MENTIONED AS A MATTER OF WONDER THAT SUCH DISPLAYS OF INTELLECT SHOULD EMANATE FROM THE VILLAGE OF HAWORTH SITUATED AMONG THE BOGS AND MOUNTAINS AND UNTIL VERY LATELY SUPPOSED TO BE IN A STATE OF SEMI-BARBARISM SUCH ARE THE WORDS OF THE NEWSPAPER TO FILL UP THE ACCOUNT OF THIS OUTWARDLY EVENTLESS YEAR I MAY ADD A FEW MORE EXTRACTS FROM THE LETTERS ENTRUSTED TO ME
IT APPEARS STRANGE THAT MR WILSON SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY THE TEACHERS OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE FOOD WAS SERVED UP
MR BRONTE RESIDED HERE FOR FIVE YEARS
HE IS PROFESSOR OF RHETORIC A MAN OF POWER AS TO MIND BUT VERY CHOLERIC AND IRRITABLE IN TEMPERAMENT
AND SHE QUICKLY NOTICED THE LEAST WANT OF CARE OR TENDERNESS ON THE PART OF OTHERS TOWARDS ANY POOR BRUTE CREATURE
IN A FEW DAYS SHE DIED
AND THITHER THE MOURNERS AND THEIR ACQUAINTANCES REPAIRED
I ACCOMPANIED MR HEAP ON HIS FIRST VISIT TO HAWORTH AFTER HIS ACCESSION TO THE VICARAGE OF BRADFORD
ANNE IS AS USUAL ALWAYS GOOD MILD AND PATIENT THE DEEP-SEATED PAIN WHICH HE WAS TO OCCASION TO HIS RELATIONS HAD NOW TAKEN A DECIDED FORM AND PRESSED HEAVILY ON CHARLOTTE'S HEALTH AND SPIRITS
URGED ECONOMICAL MOTIVES
SUBDUED PROBABLY BY THE PRESENCE OF SERIOUS ILLNESS IN THE HOUSE
THE PEWS ARE OF BLACK OAK WITH HIGH DIVISIONS
A DESCRIPTION OF VISION ISLAND
HE ADDED A GRIM KIND OF HUMOUR TO HIS STRENGTH OF WILL
IT IS NOT SO NOW
SHE WAS STILL IN THE MIDST OF HER DEEP SYMPATHY WITH MARY WHEN WORD CAME FROM HOME THAT HER AUNT MISS BRANWELL WAS AILING--WAS VERY ILL
PERHAPS FORTUNATELY SO
PLUS TARD DANS SON PALAIS IL EUT UNE FEMME QUI L'AIMAIT
I KNOW WE ARE SOME ONE AT SCHOOL SAID SHE WAS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT CLEVER PEOPLE
AND IT IS STILL BELIEVED BY SOME THAT THEY ASSUME A STRANGE VARIETY OF COLOURS AT SIX O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THAT DAY
BUT MISS BRONTE WAS NOT ONE TO SIT DOWN IN DESPAIR AFTER DISAPPOINTMENT
EST TRES-AIMABLE ET BONNE
AND THEN IF THEY ARE STILL DISPOSED TO CONSIDER PAPISTRY IN ANY OTHER LIGHT THAN A MOST FEEBLE CHILDISH PIECE OF HUMBUG LET THEM TURN PAPISTS AT ONCE--THAT'S ALL
I COULD LIKE THIS WEIGHT OF RESTRAINT TO BE TAKEN OFF
BRUSSELS HAD HAD FROM THE FIRST A STRONG ATTRACTION FOR CHARLOTTE
AFTER THE BIRTH OF THIS LAST DAUGHTER MRS BRONTE'S HEALTH BEGAN TO DECLINE
I AM AS WELL AS NEED BE AND VERY FAT

YET MR DAY AND MY AUNT'S RELATIONS WERE BENEVOLENT PEOPLE ONLY STRONGLY IMBUED WITH THE CROTCHET THAT BY A SYSTEM OF TRAINING MIGHT BE EDUCED THE HARDIHOOD AND SIMPLICITY OF THE IDEAL SAVAGE FORGETTING THE TERRIBLE ISOLATION OF FEELINGS AND HABITS WHICH THEIR PUPILS WOULD EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE LIFE WHICH THEY MUST PASS AMONG THE CORRUPTIONS AND REFINEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION
STILL IT MUST HAVE BEEN A DEPRESSING THOUGHT TO HER AT THIS PERIOD THAT HER JOYOUS HEALTHY OBTUSE PUPILS WERE SO LITTLE ANSWERABLE TO THE POWERS SHE COULD BRING TO BEAR UPON THEM
SHE WAS WEAK BUT LESS DEPRESSED IN SPIRITS THAN SHE HAD BEEN WHEN THE SCHOOL RE-OPENED AND HER POSITIVE PRACTICAL DUTIES RECOMMENCED
THOUGH THE ONE SET MIGHT BE CALLED MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND THE OTHER DISSENTERS
I CONSIDER IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER I SHALL COME HOME IN SEPTEMBER OR NOT
THOSE NIGHTS WERE TIMES OF SICK DREARY WAKEFUL MISERY
HAWORTH IS BUILT WITH AN UTTER DISREGARD OF ALL SANITARY CONDITIONS
AND IN THIS IDEA SHE WAS CONFIRMED WHEN ON ONE OF HER VISITS TO HAWORTH SHE SAW ANNE WITH A NUMBER OF CHAMBERS'S JOURNAL AND A GENTLE SMILE OF PLEASURE STEALING OVER HER PLACID FACE AS SHE READ
TRANSCRIBED FROM THE 1906 SMITH ELDER AND CO
I LEAVE YOU TO GUESS WHAT MY ANSWER WOULD BE CONVINCED THAT YOU WILL NOT DO ME THE INJUSTICE OF GUESSING WRONG ON THE 14TH OF AUGUST SHE STILL WRITES FROM HAWORTH I HAVE IN VAIN PACKED MY BOX AND PREPARED EVERYTHING FOR OUR ANTICIPATED JOURNEY
I'VE NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION TO REFLECT ON YOUR FAULTS WHEN YOU ARE SO FAR FROM ME AND WHEN BESIDES KIND LETTERS AND PRESENTS AND SO FORTH ARE CONTINUALLY BRINGING FORTH YOUR GOODNESS IN THE MOST PROMINENT LIGHT
I HOPE THEY WILL NOT REVIVE FOR THEY WERE ACUTELY PAINFUL
I HAVE SEEN BRANWELL'S PROFILE
HE NEVER THINKS OF SEEKING EMPLOYMENT AND I BEGIN TO FEAR THAT HE HAS RENDERED HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF FILLING ANY RESPECTABLE STATION IN LIFE
THE FOREGOING ACCOUNT WHICH I HEARD FROM TWO OF THE SURVIVORS IN THE PRESENCE OF A FRIEND WHO CAN VOUCH FOR THE ACCURACY OF MY REPETITION HAS TO A CERTAIN DEGREE BEEN CONFIRMED BY A LETTER FROM THE YORKSHIRE GENTLEMAN WHOSE WORDS I HAVE ALREADY QUOTED
NO OTHER COUNTY BUT YORKSHIRE COULD HAVE PRODUCED SUCH A MAN
WROTE TO HER FATHER AND URGENTLY INVITED HIM TO COME AND MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS DAUGHTER'S NEW HOME BY SPENDING A WEEK WITH HER IN IT
BEING GREATLY HARASSED BY THIS OBSTACLE I VENTURED TO APPLY TO THE MESSRS
THE MEAT FLOUR MILK C WERE CONTRACTED FOR BUT WERE OF VERY FAIR QUALITY
HER WHITE FACE ATTENUATED FORM AND FAILING STRENGTH THREATENED RAPID DECLINE
MY INFORMANT WAS STRUCK WITH THE APPEARANCE OF THE PLACE AND PROPOSED TO THE COUNTRYMAN WHO WAS ACCOMPANYING HIM TO GO UP TO IT AND TAKE A NEARER INSPECTION
THESE ARE OUR THREE GREAT PLAYS THAT ARE NOT KEPT SECRET
THE EXTRACT TELLS ALL THAT NEED BE KNOWN FOR THE PURPOSE I HAVE IN VIEW OF THE MISERABLE PAIR TO WHOM IT RELATES
THIS STONE IS ALSO DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF ANNE BRONTE 1 YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF THE REV
DESCRIPTION OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON'S PALACE ON THE PLEASANT BANKS OF THE LUSIVA
IT SEEMS THAT EVEN A LONE WOMAN CAN BE HAPPY AS WELL AS CHERISHED WIVES AND PROUD MOTHERS
PROBABLY SHE HAD LOST EXPECTATION AND ALMOST HOPE WHEN AT LENGTH IN THE BEGINNING OF MARCH SHE RECEIVED THE LETTER INSERTED IN MR C
COLBURN'S NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE BENTLEY'S MAGAZINE HOOD'S MAGAZINE JERROLD'S SHILLING MAGAZINE BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE THE EDINBURGH REVIEW TAIT'S EDINBURGH MAGAZINE THE DUBLIN UNIVERSITY MAGAZINE ALSO TO THE DAILY NEWS AND TO THE BRITANNIA PAPERS
LITTLE MARIA BRONTE WAS DELICATE AND SMALL IN APPEARANCE WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE GREATER EFFECT TO HER WONDERFUL PRECOCITY OF INTELLECT
MY FRIENDS RECOMMEND ME IF I DESIRE TO SECURE PERMANENT SUCCESS TO DELAY COMMENCING THE SCHOOL FOR SIX MONTHS LONGER AND BY ALL MEANS TO CONTRIVE BY HOOK OR BY CROOK TO SPEND THE INTERVENING TIME IN SOME SCHOOL ON THE CONTINENT
HAVING ONLY LEFT HAWORTH ON FRIDAY MORNING AT AN EARLY HOUR
IT WAS THE VANITY FAIR OF THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS TO HER
THE MANNER OF THE BUILDING WAS AS FOLLOWS
SOMETIMES I GET MELANCHOLY AT THE PROSPECT BEFORE AND BEHIND ME
FOR THERE WAS SOME CONSULTATION ON THE PART OF THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES WHETHER MARIA AND ELIZABETH SHOULD BE RECEIVED OR NOT IN JULY 1824
AT PARTING HE GAVE ME A KIND OF DIPLOMA CERTIFYING MY ABILITIES AS A TEACHER SEALED WITH THE SEAL OF THE ATHENEE ROYAL OF WHICH HE IS PROFESSOR
I AM INCLINED TO ACCEPT IT
BUT IT DID NOT BECOME HABITUAL AS FAR AS I CAN LEARN UNTIL AFTER HE WAS DISMISSED FROM HIS TUTORSHIP
BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF TRADE FAILED FOR A LONG TIME TO BRING AMENITY AND CIVILIZATION INTO THESE OUTLYING HAMLETS OR WIDELY SCATTERED DWELLINGS
KEEPER WAS FAITHFUL TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS NATURE AS LONG AS HE WAS WITH FRIENDS
STILL A COMPOSED DECENT EQUABLE DEPORTMENT IS A CAPITAL TREASURE TO A WOMAN AND THAT YOU POSSESS
FOR ANNE MIGHT TAKE HER TURN AT SOME FUTURE PERIOD IF OUR SCHOOL ANSWERED
AS THE GAY CROWDS PASSED BY HER SO HAD GAY CROWDS PACED THOSE STREETS FOR CENTURIES IN ALL THEIR VARYING COSTUMES
IN THE FAMILY ABOUT WHOM I AM WRITING WHILE THE REST WERE ALMOST ASCETIC IN THEIR HABITS BRANWELL WAS ALLOWED TO GROW UP SELF-INDULGENT
THE AMBIGUOUS CHOICE BEING DICTATED BY A SORT OF CONSCIENTIOUS SCRUPLE AT ASSUMING CHRISTIAN NAMES POSITIVELY MASCULINE WHILE WE DID NOT LIKE TO DECLARE OURSELVES WOMEN BECAUSE--WITHOUT AT THE TIME SUSPECTING THAT OUR MODE OF WRITING AND THINKING WAS NOT WHAT IS CALLED FEMININE WE HAD A VAGUE IMPRESSION THAT AUTHORESSES ARE LIABLE TO BE LOOKED ON WITH PREJUDICE
I AM TEMPTED IN ILLUSTRATION OF THIS SEASON OF MENTAL CULTURE TO RECUR TO A CONVERSATION WHICH I HAD WITH M
THE LATE BLOW TO HIS PROSPECTS AND FEELINGS HAS QUITE MADE HIM RECKLESS
MARY'S LETTERS SPOKE OF SOME OF THE PICTURES AND CATHEDRALS SHE HAD SEEN--PICTURES THE MOST EXQUISITE CATHEDRALS THE MOST VENERABLE
BUT THE SAME CAUSES WHICH AFFECTED THE HEALTH OF THE OTHER PUPILS THROUGH TYPHUS TOLD MORE SLOWLY BUT NOT LESS SURELY UPON THEIR CONSTITUTIONS
XV
SHE ALSO SAID THAT SHE HAD NOT CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY IN A WORK OF FICTION TO STATE EVERY PARTICULAR WITH THE IMPARTIALITY THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED IN A COURT OF JUSTICE NOR TO SEEK OUT MOTIVES AND MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR HUMAN FAILINGS AS SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE IF DISPASSIONATELY ANALYSING THE CONDUCT OF THOSE WHO HAD THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE INSTITUTION
THE SUBSCRIPTIONS DID NOT FLOW VERY FREELY INTO AN UNTRIED SCHEME
FOR MY OWN PART I AM AS YET WANTING A SITUATION LIKE A HOUSEMAID OUT OF PLACE
THEY HAVE RELATIONS AND ACQUAINTANCES IN BRUXELLES
SINCE THEN I HAVE FELT CALMER AND HUMBLER AND CONSEQUENTLY HAPPIER
FOR AS TO SELF-CONCEIT THAT COULD NOT RECEIVE FOOD FROM FLATTERY SINCE TO THIS HOUR NOT HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE IN THE WORLD KNOW THAT I HAVE EVER PENNED A LINE
THAT WERE IT IN THE MIDST OF A LARGE TOWN I COULD NOT PRETEND TO TAKE PUPILS ON TERMS SO MODERATE MRS B
I HAVE NOT ANSWERED IT
A SERMON WAS PREACHED BY SOME STRANGER AT THE LOWER CHAPEL ON A WEEK-DAY EVENING AND THE NEXT DAY TWO SERMONS IN SUCCESSION WERE DELIVERED AT THE UPPER CHAPEL
NOW YOU ARE FREE AND THAT WHILE YOU HAVE STILL I HOPE MANY YEARS OF VIGOUR AND HEALTH IN WHICH YOU CAN ENJOY FREEDOM
AND THEN SOME ONE HAD TO GO GROPING HERE AND THERE ON HANDS AND KNEES AND ALWAYS SOUNDING WITH A STAFF DOWN THE LONG STEEP SLIPPERY BROW TO FIND WHERE THE HORSES MIGHT TREAD SAFELY UNTIL THEY REACHED THE COMPARATIVE EASY-GOING OF THE DEEP-RUTTED MAIN ROAD
EARLY IN THIS YEAR SHE WENT TO H
THE BULL WOULD SOMETIMES WHEEL SUDDENLY ROUND SO THAT THE ROPE BY WHICH HE WAS FASTENED SWEPT THOSE WHO HAD BEEN CARELESS ENOUGH TO COME WITHIN ITS RANGE DOWN INTO THE WATER AND THE GOOD PEOPLE OF ROCHDALE HAD THE EXCITEMENT OF SEEING ONE OR TWO OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS DROWNED AS WELL AS OF WITNESSING THE BULL BAITED AND THE DOGS TORN AND TOSSED
SHE WAS EXCEEDINGLY POLITE
HERE IS A YOUTH--A BOY OF SIXTEEN--SEPARATING HIMSELF FROM HIS FAMILY AND DETERMINING TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF
I LIKED TO SEE THAT THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THE PILLAR WAS TOWARDS HER_--THAT THE LIGHT IN THE PICTURE FELL ON HER
SUCH A STRONG WISH FOR WINGS--WINGS SUCH AS WEALTH CAN FURNISH
IT IS BEAUTIFUL NOT ON ACCOUNT OF THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH IT IS WRITTEN NOT ON ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENTS IT DETAILS BUT BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLE NARRATIVE IT GIVES OF A YOUNG TALENTED SINCERE CHRISTIAN ABOUT THIS TIME MISS W REMOVED HER SCHOOL FROM THE FINE OPEN BREEZY SITUATION OF ROE HEAD TO DEWSBURY MOOR ONLY TWO OR THREE MILES DISTANT
I WISH THEY OR SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD GET ME A SITUATION
BUT WHEN SUCH LIFE ACTUALLY TOUCHES ON OUR OWN DAYS AND WE CAN HEAR PARTICULARS FROM THE LIPS OF THOSE NOW LIVING THERE COME OUT DETAILS OF COARSENESS--OF THE UNCOUTHNESS OF THE RUSTIC MINGLED WITH THE SHARPNESS OF THE TRADESMAN--OF IRREGULARITY AND FIERCE LAWLESSNESS--THAT RATHER MAR THE VISION OF PASTORAL INNOCENCE AND SIMPLICITY
BUT REMEMBERING BOTH THE STRENGTH OF WILL OF HIS OWN YOUTH AND HIS MODE OF EMPLOYING IT HE BELIEVED THAT PATRICK WAS BETTER AT HOME AND THAT HE HIMSELF COULD TEACH HIM WELL AS HE HAD TAUGHT OTHERS BEFORE
AND AT SEVEN ON SUNDAY EVENING SHE REACHED THE RUE D'ISABELLE ONCE MORE
NAH MAISTER YAH MUN LOAWZE TH'TAIBLE LOOSE THE TABLE THE MASTER SAID SHAH MEEANS YAH MUN SEY T GREYCE I TOOK THE HINT AND UTTERED THE BLESSING
NOW TO SEND YOU THE WHOLE OF THIS WOULD BE A MOCK UPON YOUR PATIENCE
E WAS EAGERLY WELCOMED BY CHARLOTTE FREELY ADMITTED BY EMILY AND KINDLY RECEIVED BY ANNE WHENEVER SHE COULD VISIT THEM
I HAVE HEARD HER CONDEMN SOCINIANISM CALVINISM AND MANY OTHER ISMS INCONSISTENT WITH CHURCH OF ENGLANDISM
ALL THAT RELATED TO HIM BELONGED TO THE HEROIC AGE
NOT HOWEVER TO STAY THERE BUT TO TAKE A MONTH'S TOUR AND RECREATION
WHEN I LEFT YOU I WAS STRONGLY IMPRESSED WITH THE FEELING THAT I WAS GOING BACK TO SORROW AUGUST 1845
NAMELY FRIVOLITY AND WASTE OF TIME
2 IN THE MONTH OF APRIL 1858 A NEAT MURAL TABLET WAS ERECTED WITHIN THE COMMUNION RAILING OF THE CHURCH AT HAWORTH TO THE MEMORY OF THE DECEASED MEMBERS OF THE BRONTE FAMILY
A LITTLE CHILD ON THAT OCCASION EXPRESSED SOME RELUCTANCE TO FINISH EATING HIS PIECE OF BREAD AT DINNER
BUT THERE WAS NO MONEY TO SPARE SAID SHE NOR ANY PROSPECT OF MY EVER EARNING MONEY ENOUGH TO HAVE THE CHANCE OF SO GREAT A PLEASURE SO I GAVE UP THINKING OF IT AT THE TIME WE CONVERSED TOGETHER ON THE SUBJECT WE WERE AT THE LAKES
SO THAT SMALL DETAILS CONCERNING PEOPLE AND PLACES HAD THEIR INTEREST AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE
WATCHING NURSING CHERISHING HER SO TENDERLY SO UNWEARIEDLY
LAST SATURDAY NIGHT HE HAD BEEN SITTING AN HOUR IN THE PARLOUR WITH PAPA
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND TO ME OF LATE AND HAVE SPARED ME ALL THOSE LITTLE SALLIES OF RIDICULE WHICH OWING TO MY MISERABLE AND WRETCHED TOUCHINESS OF CHARACTER USED FORMERLY TO MAKE ME WINCE AS IF I HAD BEEN TOUCHED WITH A HOT IRON
IT IS BY GOD'S MERCY IN OUR POWER TO ATTAIN A DEGREE OF SELF-GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR OWN HAPPINESS AND CONTRIBUTES GREATLY TO THAT OF THOSE AROUND US
I DARE SAY HE LONGED AND YEARNED TO FOLLOW THIS PATH PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE IT WOULD LEAD HIM TO THAT MYSTERIOUS LONDON--THAT BABYLON THE GREAT--WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE FILLED THE IMAGINATIONS AND HAUNTED THE MINDS OF ALL THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THIS RECLUSE FAMILY
HER NEW RESIDENCE WAS ON A LOWER SITE AND THE AIR WAS LESS EXHILARATING TO ONE BRED IN THE WILD HILL-VILLAGE OF HAWORTH
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE HAD READ THEM AND UNCONSCIOUSLY RECALLED THEM
IN MY EARLY YEARS I HAD OCCASION TO INQUIRE FOR JONATHAN WHITAKER WHO OWNED A CONSIDERABLE FARM IN THE TOWNSHIP
LET US NAME A SPECIFIC SUM WITHIN WHICH ALL EXPENSES SHALL BE INCLUDED THIS WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE
IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER PERIODICALS TO WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SENDING COPIES OF WORKS LET THEM BE SUPPLIED ALSO WITH COPIES
THE PICTURESQUENESS AND COLOUR IF I MAY SO EXPRESS IT THE GRANDEUR AND BREADTH OF ITS NARRATIONS IMPRESSED HER DEEPLY
SHE WAS NEVER HAPPY TILL SHE CARRIED HER HARD-WON KNOWLEDGE BACK TO THE REMOTE ENGLISH VILLAGE THE OLD PARSONAGE-HOUSE AND DESOLATE YORKSHIRE HILLS THEY WANTED LEARNING
BELIEVE ME THOUGH I WAS BORN IN APRIL THE MONTH OF CLOUD AND SUNSHINE I AM NOT CHANGEFUL
IN THE NEXT PLACE THERE IS A TOUCH OF ASSUMED SMARTNESS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE SIMPLE WOMANLY DIGNIFIED LETTER WHICH SHE HAD WRITTEN TO SOUTHEY UNDER NEARLY SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES THREE YEARS BEFORE
SOME FRAGMENTS OF THE MANUSCRIPT YET REMAIN BUT IT IS IN TOO SMALL A HAND TO BE READ WITHOUT GREAT FATIGUE TO THE EYES
AUNT EXCLAIMS AGAINST THE WEATHER AND THE ROADS AND THE FOUR WINDS OF HEAVEN SO I AM IN A FIX AND WHAT IS WORSE SO ARE YOU
THEIR INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER THEIR DISLIKE OF AUTHORITY AND THEIR STRONG POWERS OF THOUGHT PREDISPOSED THEM TO REBELLION AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS DICTATION OF SUCH MEN AS LAUD AND THE ARBITRARY RULE OF THE STUARTS
PIERRE L'HERMITE ETAIT GENTILHOMME DE PICARDIE EN FRANCE INVTILE QUAND VOUS ECRIVEZ ER FRANCAIS POURQUOI DONC N'A-T-IL PASSE SA VIE COMMA LES AUTRES GENTILHOMMES SES CONTEMPORAINS ONT PASSE LA LEUR A TABLE A LA CHASSE DANS SON LIT SANS S'INQUIETER DE SALADIN OU DE SES SARRASINS
I COULD NOT WRITE TO YOU IN THE WEEK YOU REQUESTED AS ABOUT THAT TIME WE WERE VERY BUSY IN PREPARING FOR ANNE'S DEPARTURE
TABBY HAD LIVED IN HAWORTH IN THE DAYS WHEN THE PACK-HORSES WENT THROUGH ONCE A WEEK WITH THEIR TINKLING BELLS AND GAY WORSTED ADORNMENT CARRYING THE PRODUCE OF THE COUNTRY FROM KEIGHLEY OVER THE HILLS TO COLNE AND BURNLEY
PER ANNUM AND SHE WAS IN THE RECEIPT OF A SMALL ANNUITY 50_L
AN ENGLISH PHYSICIAN WITH A LARGE FAMILY OF DAUGHTERS WENT TO RESIDE AT BRUSSELS FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR EDUCATION
EMILY HAD A HEAD FOR LOGIC AND A CAPABILITY OF ARGUMENT UNUSUAL IN A MAN AND RARE INDEED IN A WOMAN ACCORDING TO M
SHE HAD THE NATURAL PRESENTIMENT THAT SHE SAW THEM ALL FOR THE LAST TIME AND SHE RECEIVED BUT A DEAD KIND OF COMFORT FROM BEING REMINDED BY HER FRIENDS THAT BRUSSELS AND HAWORTH WERE NOT SO VERY FAR APART
THESE ARE TO BE SEEN IN EVERY DIRECTION PICTURESQUE MANY-GABLED WITH HEAVY STONE CARVINGS OF COATS OF ARMS FOR HERALDIC ORNAMENT
WAITING NOT IMPATIENTLY
MARY IS NOW STAYING AT BRUSSELS AT A FIRST-RATE ESTABLISHMENT THERE
SHE INQUIRED IN EVERY DIRECTION SHE COULD AS TO THE CHANCES WHICH A NEW SCHOOL MIGHT HAVE OF SUCCESS
NOW KEEPER'S HOUSEHOLD FAULT WAS THIS
WHO WERE MOREOVER LOSING THE RELAXATION OF THE HOLIDAYS IN CLOSE ATTENDANCE UPON TABBY
LOOKING TO THE LIMITED CONTENTS OF MR BRONTE'S PURSE AND THE UNPROVIDED FOR-FUTURE OF HER NIECES
BRONTE THE POETRY ENCLOSED SEEMS TO ME BY NO MEANS EQUAL TO PARTS OF THE LETTER
THE FUNERAL AND ALL WAS OVER AND MR BRONTE AND ANNE WERE SITTING TOGETHER IN QUIET GRIEF FOR THE LOSS OF ONE WHO HAD DONE HER PART WELL IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AND EARNED THE REGARD AND RESPECT OF MANY WHO NEVER KNEW HOW MUCH THEY SHOULD MISS HER TILL SHE WAS GONE
THE SERVICE WAS MENTIONED AS AN APOLOGY BUT KINDNESS WAS THE REAL MOTIVE THE FIRST BREAK IN THIS LIFE OF REGULAR DUTIES AND EMPLOYMENTS CAME HEAVILY AND SADLY
DANGEROUS WHEN PERVERTED
MAIS JE VOUS REVERRAI UN JOUR
HEGER HAS VOUCHSAFED TO GIVE US ARE I SUPPOSE TO BE CONSIDERED A GREAT FAVOUR
THUS SHE WOULD LET ME ADVISE AND PATRONISE MOST IMPERIOUSLY SOMETIMES PICKING OUT ANY GRAIN OF SENSE THERE MIGHT BE IN WHAT I SAID BUT NEVER ALLOWING ANY ONE MATERIALLY TO INTERFERE WITH HER INDEPENDENCE OF THOUGHT AND ACTION
WHY DO YOU SMILE ONLY BECAUSE I SEE THEY HAVE INSERTED ONE OF MY POEMS WAS THE QUIET REPLY
BUT HOW COULD I GET THERE
AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO REPLY TO IT AND I WOULD LET IT DIE
I BELIEVE THAT THE SAVAGE YEOMAN IS STILL LIVING
SHE DISLIKED MANY OF THE CUSTOMS OF THE PLACE AND PARTICULARLY DREADED THE COLD DAMP ARISING FROM THE FLAG FLOORS IN THE PASSAGES AND PARLOURS OF HAWORTH PARSONAGE
HE WAS THE FIRST THAT HAD OFFERED ANY RESISTANCE TO THE PROGRESS OF THE LUDDITES WHO HAD BECOME BY THIS TIME SO NUMEROUS AS ALMOST TO ASSUME THE CHARACTER OF AN INSURRECTIONARY ARMY
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT WE SAW EXCEPT ST PAUL'S
AND GREAT ECONOMY WAS NECESSARY IN ALL THE DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
THE DAY OF CHARLOTTE'S RETURN HE HAD RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MR STERNLY DISMISSING HIM INTIMATING THAT HIS PROCEEDINGS WERE DISCOVERED CHARACTERISING THEM AS BAD BEYOND EXPRESSION AND CHARGING HIM ON PAIN OF EXPOSURE TO BREAK OFF IMMEDIATELY AND FOR EVER ALL COMMUNICATION WITH EVERY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
WHERE WHEN BOTH WERE SEATED ON A TUFT OF HEATHER IN SOME HIGH LONELY PLACE SHE COULD ACQUAINT THE OLD WOMAN AT LEISURE WITH ALL THAT SHE WANTED TO HEAR
AND MADAME HEGER INVARIABLY PREFERRED ALL THEIR WISHES TO ME THROUGH HER
ALL THIS MUST BE BORNE IN MIND WHILE READING THE FOLLOWING LETTERS
WINTER THOUGH IT WAS THE SISTERS TOOK THEIR ACCUSTOMED WALKS ON THE SNOW-COVERED MOORS
I SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING HER FREQUENTLY
ON SATURDAY HALF-HOLIDAYS THEY WENT LONG SCRAMBLING WALKS DOWN MYSTERIOUS SHADY LANES THEN CLIMBING THE UPLANDS AND THUS GAINING EXTENSIVE VIEWS OVER THE COUNTRY ABOUT WHICH SO MUCH HAD TO BE TOLD BOTH OF ITS PAST AND PRESENT HISTORY
THIS HABIT OF MAKING OUT INTERESTS FOR THEMSELVES THAT MOST CHILDREN GET WHO HAVE NONE IN ACTUAL LIFE WAS VERY STRONG IN HER
THE GIRLS WERE TAUGHT BY THEIR FATHER THEORETICALLY AND BY THEIR AUNT PRACTICALLY THAT TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN ALL HOUSEHOLD WORK WAS IN THEIR POSITION WOMAN'S SIMPLE DUTY
BESIDES THEY WERE HAPPY IN THE FEELING THAT THEY WERE MAKING PROGRESS IN ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THEY HAD SO LONG BEEN YEARNING TO ACQUIRE
OMIT THE COMEDIES OF SHAKSPEARE AND THE DON JUAN PERHAPS THE CAIN OF BYRON THOUGH THE LATTER IS A MAGNIFICENT POEM AND READ THE REST FEARLESSLY
THE WRITERS HAD BEEN FOR A LONG TIME TOO BUSY AND LATTERLY TOO MUCH ABSORBED IN POLITICS
AND THIS MODE OF LIVING HE CONTINUED TO FOLLOW FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS
IN WINTER PURPLE STUFF FROCKS AND PURPLE CLOTH CLOAKS
THERE ARE NUMEROUS RECORDS TOO THAT SHOW THE KINDLY WAY IN WHICH THE EJECTED MINISTERS WERE RECEIVED BY THE GENTRY AS WELL AS BY THE POORER PART OF THE INHABITANTS DURING THE PERSECUTING DAYS OF CHARLES II
THEY ARE VERY MUTINOUS AND DIFFICULT FOR THE TEACHERS TO MANAGE
HE AND MR W
I DO NOT SAY THAT I AGREE EITHER WITH HIM OR WITH MR W EITHER IN ALL OR IN HALF THEIR OPINIONS
IN JANUARY 1840 CHARLOTTE HEARD OF THE DEATH OF A YOUNG GIRL WHO HAD BEEN A PUPIL OF HERS AND A SCHOOLFELLOW OF ANNE'S AT THE TIME WHEN THE SISTERS WERE TOGETHER AT ROE HEAD
CETTE IDEE ME SOURIS CAR LE SOUVENIR DE VOS BONTES NE S'EFFACERA JAMAIS DE MA MEMOIRE ET TANT QUE CE SOUVENIR DURERA LE RESPECT QUE VOUS M'AVEZ INSPIRE DURERA AUSSI
I NEVER WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO RALLY FOR AS MUCH AS A SINGLE HOUR WHILE I WAS THERE
THE EXCUSE MADE FOR THE SURGEON WAS THAT HE WAS NEAR EIGHTY AND GETTING A BIT DOITED AND HAD HAD A MATTER O TWENTY CHILDER AMONG THE MOST UNMOVED OF THE LOOKERS-ON WAS THE BROTHER OF THE BOY SO BADLY HURT
AND TABBY
THE INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH IS COMMONPLACE
MOREOVER SHE WAS A NATIVE OF THE DISTRICT IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING ROE HEAD AS WERE THE MAJORITY OF HER PUPILS
BUT E WHO IS SHADOWED FORTH IN THE CAROLINE HELSTONE OF SHIRLEY MANAGED TO WIN CONFIDENCE AND WAS ALLOWED TO GIVE SYMPATHY
CAUSES OF THE WAR
BUT A CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE NOW SIR
BUT FROM INDIVIDUALS IN THE VILLAGE THE FAMILY STOOD ALOOF UNLESS SOME DIRECT SERVICE WAS REQUIRED FROM THE FIRST
THIS PECULIARITY I PERCEIVE VERY STRONGLY IN CHARLOTTE'S WRITINGS AT THIS TIME
WILL CERTAINLY FORM A THINNER VOLUME THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED
PRESERVE THIS WRITING AS A CURIOSITY IN CALIGRAPHY--I THINK IT IS EXQUISITE--ALL BRILLIANT BLACK BLOTS AND UTTERLY ILLEGIBLE LETTERS
17
IT WAS THE HOUSEHOLD CUSTOM AMONG THESE GIRLS TO SEW TILL NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
THESE DISGRACEFUL SCENES WERE CONTINUED FOR MANY WEEKS AND SO VIOLENT WAS THE FEELING THAT THE DIFFERENT PARTIES COULD HARDLY KEEP FROM BLOWS AS THEY CAME THROUGH THE CHAPEL-YARD
MR REDHEAD AND DR RAMSBOTHAM HIS SON-IN-LAW ARE NO STRANGERS TO ME
AND THUS CONCLUDES
WALKED OUT WITH HIS CHILDREN AND I HAD ORDERS TO FOLLOW A LITTLE BEHIND
I FEEL AN ABSOLUTE CONVICTION THAT IF THIS ADVANTAGE WERE ALLOWED US IT WOULD BE THE MAKING OF US FOR LIFE
THOUGH THE DUTIES OF THE DAY MIGHT BE TEDIOUS AND MONOTONOUS THERE WERE ALWAYS TWO OR THREE HAPPY HOURS TO LOOK FORWARD TO IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE AND MISS W SAT TOGETHER--SOMETIMES LATE INTO THE NIGHT--AND HAD QUIET PLEASANT CONVERSATIONS OR PAUSES OF SILENCE AS AGREEABLE BECAUSE EACH FELT THAT AS SOON AS A THOUGHT OR REMARK OCCURRED WHICH THEY WISHED TO EXPRESS THERE WAS AN INTELLIGENT COMPANION READY TO SYMPATHISE AND YET THEY WERE NOT COMPELLED TO MAKE TALK MISS W WAS ALWAYS ANXIOUS TO AFFORD MISS BRONTE EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF RECREATION IN HER POWER
TABBY'S ILLNESS HAD PREYED ON THE FAMILY RESOURCES
I FORGET GOD AND WILL NOT GOD FORGET ME
CERTAINLY THIS WOULD BE THE CASE ON THE MAN'S PART
ANOTHER OF THE GIRLS RECALLS HER FIRST SIGHT OF CHARLOTTE ON THE DAY SHE CAME STANDING BY THE SCHOOLROOM WINDOW LOOKING OUT ON THE SNOWY LANDSCAPE AND CRYING WHILE ALL THE REST WERE AT PLAY
POOR TABBY BECAME SO LAME THAT SHE WAS AT LENGTH OBLIGED TO LEAVE US
MADAME HEGER HAS MADE A PROPOSAL FOR BOTH ME AND EMILY TO STAY ANOTHER HALF-YEAR OFFERING TO DISMISS HER ENGLISH MASTER AND TAKE ME AS ENGLISH TEACHER
I AM MORE CONFIRMED IN THAT RESOLUTION THE MORE I SEE OF HIM
L'UNE ET L'AUTRE SONT EXTREMEMENT IMPATIENTES DE VOUS VOIR
IT WAS PRINCIPALLY INHABITED BY BLANKET WEAVERS WHO WORKED IN THEIR OWN COTTAGES
HIS PRECEPTS TO THIS EFFECT COMBINED WITH CHARLOTTE'S LACK OF HOPE MADE HER ALWAYS FEARFUL OF LOVING TOO MUCH
I HAVE COMMUNICATED THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT TO M
AND ON THE 16TH SHE SAYS THE MS
AND THE IDEA OF GOING THERE IN PREFERENCE TO ANY OTHER PLACE HAD ONLY BEEN GIVEN UP IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INFORMATION RECEIVED OF THE SECOND-RATE CHARACTER OF ITS SCHOOLS
ON DECEMBER 29TH HER LETTER TO SOUTHEY WAS DESPATCHED
HEREIN WAS THE STRONG FEELING OF DUTY BEING PARAMOUNT TO PLEASURE WHICH LAY AT THE FOUNDATION OF CHARLOTTE'S CHARACTER MADE MOST APPARENT
THEY ATTRACTED NUMBERS OF PROFLIGATE PEOPLE TO HAWORTH AND BROUGHT A MATCH TO THE COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS OF THE PLACE ONLY TOO READY TO BLAZE OUT INTO WICKEDNESS
WRITE AGAIN SOON FOR I FEEL RATHER FIERCE AND WANT STROKING DOWN JUNE 13TH 1845
ALL IN THE HOUSE ARE CATHOLICS EXCEPT OURSELVES ONE OTHER GIRL AND THE GOUVERNANTE OF MADAME'S CHILDREN AN ENGLISHWOMAN IN RANK SOMETHING BETWEEN A LADY'S MAID AND A NURSERY GOVERNESS
SHE ANSWERED BY LAYING IT OUT IN PREPARATION FOR A HAPPY ETERNITY I MAY NOT HAVE GIVEN PRECISELY THEIR WORDS BUT I HAVE NEARLY DONE SO AS THEY MADE A DEEP AND LASTING IMPRESSION ON MY MEMORY
THUS WE SEE THAT WHILE HER IMAGINATION RECEIVED VIVID IMPRESSIONS HER EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING HAD FULL POWER TO RECTIFY THEM BEFORE HER FANCIES BECAME REALITIES
YOU REMEMBER MR AND MRS
CHARLOTTE TOLD ME THAT AT THIS PERIOD OF HER LIFE DRAWING AND WALKING OUT WITH HER SISTERS FORMED THE TWO GREAT PLEASURES AND RELAXATIONS OF HER DAY
A RACE ALSO WAS FREQUENT AT THE END
A MEETING WAS CONVENED AND THE BUSINESS SETTLED BY THE VICAR'S CONCEDING THE CHOICE TO THE TRUSTEES AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE VICAR'S PRESENTATION
FALTERING AND RESTING OCCASIONALLY ON SOME OF THE MANY BENCHES PLACED FOR THE REPOSE OF HAPPY GROUPS OR FOR SOLITARY WANDERERS LIKE HERSELF
I ONLY WISH TO BE SO
P.S.--SINCE WRITING THE ABOVE I FIND THAT AUNT AND PAPA HAVE DETERMINED TO GO TO LIVERPOOL FOR A FORTNIGHT AND TAKE US ALL WITH THEM
THIS CERTIFICATE IS DATED DECEMBER 29TH 1843 AND ON THE 2ND OF JANUARY 1844 SHE ARRIVED AT HAWORTH
NOT SO THE CURATES
FOR THE SAME REASON IN THE LATTER YEARS OF HER LIFE SHE PASSED NEARLY ALL HER TIME AND TOOK MOST OF HER MEALS IN HER BEDROOM
AND WHO HAVING ATTAINED THE AGE OF FORTY-FIVE OR UPWARDS RETAINS IN HER POSSESSION A WELL-REGULATED MIND A DISPOSITION TO ENJOY SIMPLE PLEASURES AND FORTITUDE TO SUPPORT INEVITABLY PAINS SYMPATHY WITH THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS AND WILLINGNESS TO RELIEVE WANT AS FAR AS HER MEANS EXTEND DURING THE TIME THAT THE NEGOTIATION WITH MESSRS
IMPAIRING THE FORCE OF THIS GIFT WAS A STUBBORN TENACITY OF WILL WHICH RENDERED HER OBTUSE TO ALL REASONING WHERE HER OWN WISHES OR HER OWN SENSE OF RIGHT WAS CONCERNED
I CANNOT PROCURE INK WITHOUT GOING INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM WHERE I DO NOT WISH TO GO I SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN TO YOU LONG SINCE AND TOLD YOU EVERY DETAIL OF THE UTTERLY NEW SCENE INTO WHICH I HAVE LATELY BEEN CAST HAD I NOT BEEN DAILY EXPECTING A LETTER FROM YOURSELF AND WONDERING AND LAMENTING THAT YOU DID NOT WRITE
IT WAS ANIMATING TO SEE THE IMMENSE CROWDS AND THE GENERAL GAIETY BUT THE MASKS WERE NOTHING
SHE WOULD THREAD THE STREETS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE RUE D'ISABELLE AND YET AVOID IT AND ITS OCCUPANT TILL AS LATE AN HOUR AS SHE DARED BE OUT
THEY ARE VERY NICE ONES
AT ALL EVENTS TIME SOON WENT WHILE I SCALED THE HILLS TO SEE T MAIRE AT WOR THRETTY YEAR OWD AN'T FEIL AT WOR FEWER ON SITTING DOWN TO THE TABLE A VENERABLE WOMAN OFFICIATED AND AFTER FILLING THE CUPS SHE THUS ADDRESSED ME
BUT I HAVE A SUFFICIENT AND VERY MELANCHOLY EXCUSE IN AN ACCIDENT THAT BEFELL OUR OLD FAITHFUL TABBY A FEW DAYS AFTER MY RETURN HOME
AND HAD THEIR OPINIONS AND THEIR PARTIES AND THEIR FIERCE DISCUSSIONS LIKE THEIR ELDERS--POSSIBLY THEIR BETTERS
JE COMPTE BIENTOT AVOIR DE VOS NOUVELLES
WHEN AT HOME SHE TOOK THE PRINCIPAL PART OF THE COOKING UPON HERSELF AND DID ALL THE HOUSEHOLD IRONING
I HAVE HAD SOME OF THE LETTERS PLACED IN MY HANDS WHICH SHE ADDRESSED TO HER OLD SCHOOLMISTRESS MISS W THEY BEGIN A LITTLE BEFORE THIS TIME
AND THE DAUGHTERS GREW UP OUT OF CHILDHOOD INTO GIRLHOOD BEREFT IN A SINGULAR MANNER OF ALL SUCH SOCIETY AS WOULD HAVE BEEN NATURAL TO THEIR AGE SEX AND STATION
AT THE FIRST PERUSAL OF YOUR LETTER I FELT ONLY SHAME AND REGRET THAT I HAD EVER VENTURED TO TROUBLE YOU WITH MY CRUDE RHAPSODY
HER AFFRIGHT AT THE TOSSING WAS PROBABLY THE REASON WHY IT WAS PERSEVERED IN
HIS FAMILY WAS AT OAKWELL
I THINK THOSE I HAVE MENTIONED WILL SUFFICE FOR ADVERTISING IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS LATTER REQUEST MESSRS
FOR MY TIME IS ENTIRELY OCCUPIED
HE WENT TO A KIND MOTHERLY WOMAN WHO HAD HAD SOME CONNECTION WITH THE SCHOOL--AS LAUNDRESS I BELIEVE--AND ASKED HER TO COME AND TELL HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THEM
HEGER HAVING HEARD OF WHAT WAS IN AGITATION SENT FOR ME THE DAY AFTER AND PRONOUNCED WITH VEHEMENCE HIS DECISION THAT I SHOULD NOT LEAVE
BUT IT WAS THERE NOTWITHSTANDING ALL HIS PHILOSOPHIC CALM AND DIGNITY OF DEMEANOUR
EXACTING YET GENEROUS
BUT TOO OFTEN ILL-HEALTH ASSAILED HER IN A PART FAR MORE TO BE DREADED
YOUNG MEN JUNE 1826
BUT YOU RECOGNISE THE NATURE OF THESE TREES THIS FOLIAGE--THE CYPRESS THE WILLOW THE YEW
SOME OF US ONCE URGED HER TO BE ON OUR SIDE IN A GAME AT BALL
IF YOU LIKE POETRY LET IT BE FIRST-RATE
WHERE DO YOU WISH TO GO
AND EVEN THESE WERE BEGINNING TO FAIL WHEN A FORTUNATE THAW RELEASED THEM FROM THEIR PRISON
I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO RETURN TO ENGLAND TO DO NOTHING
HE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME JUST AT PRESENT BECAUSE I HAVE WRITTEN A TRANSLATION WHICH HE CHOSE TO STIGMATIZE AS PEU CORRECT HE DID NOT TELL ME SO BUT WROTE THE WORD ON THE MARGIN OF MY BOOK AND ASKED IN BRIEF STERN PHRASE HOW IT HAPPENED THAT MY COMPOSITIONS WERE ALWAYS BETTER THAN MY TRANSLATIONS
YOU CONSCIENTIOUSLY WISH TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT ONE EVEN THOUGH IT BE THE MOST STEEP STRAIT AND RUGGED
THAT LETTER IS CONSECRATED
HE FEARLESSLY TOOK WHATEVER SIDE IN LOCAL OR NATIONAL POLITICS APPEARED TO HIM RIGHT
BUT HER OCCUPATION WAS NOT SUFFICIENT FOOD FOR HER GREAT FORCES OF INTELLECT AND THEY CRIED OUT PERPETUALLY GIVE GIVE WHILE THE COMPARATIVELY LESS BREEZY AIR OF DEWSBURY MOOR TOLD UPON HER HEALTH AND SPIRITS MORE AND MORE
AND THE POWERFUL YORKSHIRE CHARACTER WHICH WAS SCARCELY TAMED INTO SUBJECTION BY ALL THE CONTACT IT MET WITH IN BUSY TOWN OR CROWDED MART HAS BEFORE NOW BROKEN OUT INTO STRANGE WILFULNESS IN THE REMOTER DISTRICTS
HEGER HAD FOUND TIME TO WRITE A LETTER OF SYMPATHY TO MR BRONTE ON THE LOSS WHICH HE HAD JUST SUSTAINED
ONE OF THE BOW-WINDOWED ROOMS ON THE GROUND FLOOR WITH THE PLEASANT LOOK OUT I HAVE DESCRIBED WAS THE DRAWING-ROOM
I HAVE QUOTED THE WORD BRIGHT IN THE ACCOUNT OF CHARLOTTE
AND ACCORDINGLY THE NEGOTIATION FELL THROUGH
WITHIN FOUR MILES OF YOU AT A PLACE NEITHER OF US IS UNACQUAINTED WITH BEING NO OTHER THAN THE IDENTICAL ROE HEAD MENTIONED ABOVE
SHE SINCERELY LOVED AND RESPECTED THE FORMER SCHOOLMISTRESS TO WHOM SHE WAS NOW BECOME BOTH COMPANION AND FRIEND
I CANNOT SHAKE IT OFF
AND AS I HAVE SAID WHAT WITH VILLAS GREAT WORSTED FACTORIES ROWS OF WORKMEN'S HOUSES WITH HERE AND THERE AN OLD-FASHIONED FARMHOUSE AND OUT-BUILDINGS IT CAN HARDLY BE CALLED COUNTRY ANY PART OF THE WAY
IN OTHER RESPECTS I HAVE NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL TO COMPLAIN OF NOR IS THIS A CAUSE FOR COMPLAINT
NAPOLEON NE SE REGARDAIT PAS COMME UN HOMME MAIS COMME L'INCARNATION D'UN PEUPLE
I SHOULD LIKE IT TO BE PRINTED IN ONE OCTAVO VOLUME OF THE SAME QUALITY OF PAPER AND SIZE OF TYPE AS MOXON'S LAST EDITION OF WORDSWORTH
A SMOKY ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDS THESE OLD DWELLINGS OF FORMER YORKSHIRE SQUIRES AND BLIGHTS AND BLACKENS THE ANCIENT TREES THAT OVERSHADOW THEM
PERHAPS THE NEWS OF HER DEATH FALLING SUDDENLY INTO THE LIFE OF WHICH HER PATIENT EXISTENCE HAD FORMED A PART ONLY A LITTLE WEEK OR SO BEFORE MADE THOSE WHO REMAINED AT COWAN BRIDGE LOOK WITH MORE ANXIETY ON ELIZABETH'S SYMPTOMS WHICH ALSO TURNED OUT TO BE CONSUMPTIVE
HE BELIEVED THAT HE HAD TO DO WITH PUPILS CAPABLE FROM THEIR READY SYMPATHY WITH THE INTELLECTUAL THE REFINED THE POLISHED OR THE NOBLE OF CATCHING THE ECHO OF A STYLE AND SO REPRODUCING THEIR OWN THOUGHTS IN A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR MANNER
THIS HIGH ROAD IS NEARLY DISUSED NOW
IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS I AM WELL SATISFIED WITH MY POSITION AND YOU MAY SAY SO TO PEOPLE WHO INQUIRE AFTER ME IF ANY ONE DOES WRITE TO ME DEAR WHENEVER YOU CAN
THAT SHE CARES NOTHING ABOUT ME EXCEPT TO CONTRIVE HOW THE GREATEST POSSIBLE QUANTITY OF LABOUR MAY BE GOT OUT OF ME
AS FEW SHIRKED THEIR LIQUOR THERE WERE VERY FREQUENTLY UP AND-DOWN FIGHTS BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE DAY
HAVE YOU NO DOORS IN YOUR COUNTRY YOI RESPONDED ROBIN WE HEV BUT WE NIVVER STEIK EM I HAVE FREQUENTLY REMARKED THE NUMBER OF DOORS OPEN EVEN IN WINTER
THUS CHILDREN LEADING A SECLUDED LIFE ARE OFTEN THOUGHTFUL AND DREAMY
WE SHALL FIND IT A GREAT PRIVILEGE IN MANY WAYS
AMONG THESE PAPERS THERE IS A LIST OF HER WORKS WHICH I COPY AS A CURIOUS PROOF HOW EARLY THE RAGE FOR LITERARY COMPOSITION HAD SEIZED UPON HER CATALOGUE OF MY BOOKS WITH THE PERIOD OF THEIR COMPLETION UP TO AUGUST 3RD 1830
I HAVE AS YET HAD NO CAUSE TO COMPLAIN OF WANT OF CONSIDERATENESS OR CIVILITY
AND THE MEDICAL MAN WHOM AT LENGTH THROUGH MISS W---'S ENTREATY SHE WAS LED TO CONSULT INSISTED ON HER RETURN TO THE PARSONAGE
I HAVE MANY TIMES FELT IT A DISADVANTAGE AND ALTHOUGH I THANK GOD IT HAS NEVER LED ME INTO ERROR YET IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF UNCERTAINTY AND DOUBT I HAVE DEEPLY FELT THE WANT OF A GUIDE AND INSTRUCTOR IN THE SAME LETTER SHE TELLS MR BRONTE THAT SHE HAS INFORMED HER SISTERS OF HER ENGAGEMENT AND THAT SHE SHOULD NOT SEE THEM AGAIN SO SOON AS SHE HAD INTENDED
THERE IS ONE INDIVIDUAL OF WHOM I HAVE NOT YET SPOKEN--M
NOT OF A WARM OR IMPULSIVE TEMPERAMENT SHE WAS NATURALLY GOVERNED BY HER CONSCIENCE RATHER THAN BY HER AFFECTIONS
THEIR PRIDE WHO SHOULD SOME TIME BRING GREAT GLORY TO THE NAME OF BRONTE
I SOON FOUND THAT THE CONSTANT DEMAND ON MY STOCK OF ANIMAL SPIRITS REDUCED THEM TO THE LOWEST STATE OF EXHAUSTION
SHE NEVER CAME IN CONTACT WITH PUBLIC OPINION AND HER OWN DECISION OF WHAT WAS RIGHT AND FITTING WAS A LAW FOR HER CONDUCT AND APPEARANCE WITH WHICH SHE ALLOWED NO ONE TO INTERFERE
HE WAS TO DIE AT THE END OF A SHORT AND BLIGHTED LIFE
NO ONE SHALL EVER SEE IT BUT PAPA AND MY BROTHER AND SISTERS
WE FORGET NOW-A-DAYS SO RAPID HAVE BEEN THE CHANGES FOR THE BETTER HOW CRUEL WAS THE CONDITION OF NUMBERS OF LABOURERS AT THE CLOSE OF THE GREAT PENINSULAR WAR
I WISH I COULD ALWAYS ACT ACCORDING TO YOUR ADVICE
BY DINT OF STUDYING MAPS HE WAS AS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH IT EVEN DOWN TO ITS BY-WAYS AS IF HE HAD LIVED THERE
NAY THERE WAS SOME TALK OF ONE OF MADAME HEGER'S DAUGHTERS BEING SENT TO HER AS A PUPIL IF SHE FULFILLED HER INTENTION OF TRYING TO BEGIN A SCHOOL
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS SEEING ALL BEAUTIFUL AROUND YOU--PLEASANT WOODS WHITE PATHS GREEN LAWNS AND BLUE SUNSHINY SKY--AND NOT HAVING A FREE MOMENT OR A FREE THOUGHT LEFT TO ENJOY THEM
IT IS LESS PAIN FOR ME TO ENDURE THE GREATEST INCONVENIENCE THAN TO GO INTO THE KITCHEN TO REQUEST ITS REMOVAL
MR WILSON BEING NOT ONLY A TRUSTEE BUT THE TREASURER AND SECRETARY
TO LACE THE STAYS WITHOUT A HANDKERCHIEF ON THE NECK IS CONSIDERED A DISGUSTING PIECE OF INDELICACY THE PASSAGE IN THIS LETTER WHERE M
IT IS VERY EDIFYING AND PROFITABLE TO CREATE A WORLD OUT OF YOUR OWN BRAINS AND PEOPLE IT WITH INHABITANTS WHO ARE SO MANY MELCHISEDECS AND HAVE NO FATHER NOR MOTHER BUT YOUR OWN IMAGINATION I AM SORRY I DID NOT EXIST FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE LADIES MAGAZINE WAS FLOURISHING LIKE A GREEN BAY-TREE
I HAVE NO WISH TO BE PITIED EXCEPT BY YOURSELF
THIS SHALL BE THE DUKE WHEN I HAD SAID THIS EMILY LIKEWISE TOOK UP ONE AND SAID IT SHOULD BE HERS
THE RACE-COURSE YOU WILL KNOW TO BE ANYTHING BUT LEVEL INTO THE MIDST OF THIS LAWLESS YET NOT UNKINDLY POPULATION MR BRONTE BROUGHT HIS WIFE AND SIX LITTLE CHILDREN IN FEBRUARY 1820
YOU CANNOT DECIDE WHETHER DUTY AND RELIGION COMMAND YOU TO GO OUT INTO THE COLD AND FRIENDLESS WORLD AND THERE TO EARN YOUR LIVING BY GOVERNESS DRUDGERY OR WHETHER THEY ENJOIN YOUR CONTINUED STAY WITH YOUR AGED MOTHER NEGLECTING FOR THE PRESENT EVERY PROSPECT OF INDEPENDENCY FOR YOURSELF AND PUTTING UP WITH DAILY INCONVENIENCE SOMETIMES EVEN WITH PRIVATIONS
HEGER AND HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW
BOTH M
I THINK HE MUST BE LIKE ALL THE OTHER CURATES I HAVE SEEN
WHAT IS MORE SHE HAD KNOWN THE BOTTOM OR VALLEY IN THOSE PRIMITIVE DAYS WHEN THE FAIRIES FREQUENTED THE MARGIN OF THE BECK ON MOONLIGHT NIGHTS AND HAD KNOWN FOLK WHO HAD SEEN THEM
NO EXAGGERATION OF DISTRESS
THE PEOPLE IN HAWORTH WERE NONE OF THEM VERY POOR
SHE DID NOT GET HER OPINIONS FROM HER FATHER--THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY--BUT FROM THE PAPERS C HE PREFERRED IN ILLUSTRATION OF THE TRUTH OF THIS I MAY GIVE AN EXTRACT FROM A LETTER TO HER BROTHER WRITTEN FROM ROE HEAD MAY 17TH 1832:--"LATELY I HAD BEGUN TO THINK THAT I HAD LOST ALL THE INTEREST WHICH I USED FORMERLY TO TAKE IN POLITICS
HEAVEN KNOWS I CANNOT HELP IT
BUT NOW AND THEN ON SOME JUST OCCASION FOR VIVID INTEREST OR WHOLESOME INDIGNATION A LIGHT WOULD SHINE OUT AS IF SOME SPIRITUAL LAMP HAD BEEN KINDLED WHICH GLOWED BEHIND THOSE EXPRESSIVE ORBS
WHEN ONE OF THE FORMER WAS PLACED IN MINE IT WAS LIKE THE SOFT TOUCH OF A BIRD IN THE MIDDLE OF MY PALM
MISS W SPOKE OF THOSE TIMES
JE N'AI PAS L'HONNEUR DE VOUS CONNAITRE PERSONNELLEMENT ET CEPENDANT J'EPROUVE POUR VOTRE PERSONNE UN SENTIMENT DE SINCERE VENERATION CAR EN JUGEANT UN PERE DE FAMILLE PAR SES ENFANTS ON NE RISQUE PAS DE SE TROMPER ET SOUS CE RAPPORT L'EDUCATION ET LES SENTIMENTS QUE NOUS AVONS TROUVES DANS MESDEMOISELLES VOS FILLES N'ONT PU QUE NOUS DONNER UNE TRES-HAUTE IDEE DE VOTRE MERITE ET DE VOTRE CARACTERE
WE AVOID THEM WHICH IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO DO AS WE HAVE THE BRAND OF PROTESTANTISM AND ANGLICISM UPON US
STILL WE CAN FANCY WITH WHAT INTEREST IT WAS READ AT HAWORTH PARSONAGE AND HOW THE SISTERS WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO FIND OUT REASONS FOR OPINIONS OR HINTS FOR THE FUTURE GUIDANCE OF THEIR TALENTS
HALF THAT LENGTH OF TIME BACK THE CODE OF MORALS SEEMED TO BE FORMED UPON THAT OF THEIR NORSE ANCESTORS
CALIBAN THE WIND BLOWETH WHERE IT LISTETH
OF COURSE THE CHURCH WAS CROWDED
OF THE CAUSES OF THIS DETERIORATION I CANNOT SPEAK
IN THE GREAT HALL HANGS A MIGHTY PAIR OF STAG'S HORNS AND DEPENDENT FROM THEM A PRINTED CARD RECORDING THE FACT THAT ON THE 1ST OF SEPTEMBER 1763 THERE WAS A GREAT HUNTING-MATCH WHEN THIS STAG WAS SLAIN
AND EVERY ONE SEEMS TO EXPECT THAT I SHOULD IMMEDIATELY COMMENCE A SCHOOL
THERE ARE PRIVATIONS AND HUMILIATIONS TO SUBMIT TO
AT ONE OF THEIR HOUSES I SUSPECT SHE MET WITH THE PERSON TO WHOM THE FOLLOWING LETTER REFERS--SOME ONE HAVING A SLIGHT RESEMBLANCE TO THE CHARACTER OF ST JOHN IN THE LAST VOLUME OF JANE EYRE AND LIKE HIM IN HOLY ORDERS
ANNE MICHAEL SADLER LORD BENTINCK SIR HENRY HALFORD
THAT THE FOOD ITSELF WAS SPOILT BY THE DIRTY CARELESSNESS OF THE COOK SO THAT SHE AND HER SISTERS DISLIKED THEIR MEALS EXCEEDINGLY
SHE WAS VERY SHY AND NERVOUS AND SPOKE WITH A STRONG IRISH ACCENT
BESIDES IF MONEY WERE AT HIS DISPOSAL HE WOULD USE IT ONLY TO HIS OWN INJURY
HOWEVER WHEN I HAVE ACQUIRED AS MUCH GERMAN AS I THINK FIT I THINK I SHALL PACK UP BAG AND BAGGAGE AND DEPART
AND IT WAS A GREAT THING TO GET A ROOMY BUILDING CLOSE TO THE HIGH ROAD AND NOT TOO FAR FROM THE HABITATION OF MR WILSON THE ORIGINATOR OF THE EDUCATIONAL SCHEME
THE HEGERS HAVE DISCOVERED SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF VILLETTE THAT AT THIS BEGINNING OF HER CAREER AS ENGLISH TEACHER IN THEIR SCHOOL THE CONDUCT OF HER PUPILS WAS OFTEN IMPERTINENT AND MUTINOUS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE
HE WAS LOYAL IN EVERY FIBRE TO CHURCH AND KING
WITH THE FORCED CALM OF A SUPPRESSED EAGERNESS THAT SENDS A GLOW OF DESIRE THROUGH EVERY WORD OF THE FOLLOWING LETTER SHE WROTE TO HER AUNT THUS
BUT SO IT IS
BUT SO IT IS
HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO CONCLUDE WITH PRAYER WHEN UP STARTED THE SINGERS AND SCREAMED FORTH ANOTHER HYMN
OR SEE AS CHARLOTTE BRONTE DID FROM THE WINDOW A WHITE PACKET TOSSED OVER THE AVAIL BY COME SWIFT STRONG MOTION OF AN ARM THE REST OF THE TRAVELLER'S BODY UNSEEN
THIS SHOWED A FEARFUL DEGREE OF PHYSICAL WEAKNESS IN ONE WHO WAS GENERALLY SO SELF-CONTROLLED
PASSIONATE WHEN PROVOKED BUT MOST AFFECTIONATE IF CARESSED
CHARLOTTE BRONTE HAD A BAD MARK
WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE VERY YOUNG WHEN AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER THE OLDEST WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OF AGE AND THE YOUNGEST ABOUT FOUR THINKING THAT THEY KNEW MORE THAN I HAD YET DISCOVERED IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM SPEAK WITH LESS TIMIDITY I DEEMED THAT IF THEY WERE PUT UNDER A SORT OF COVER I MIGHT GAIN MY END
VERY ILL SUFFERING GREAT PAIN BUT SELDOM IF EVER COMPLAINING
SMALL AS IT WAS IT WAS NOT CALLED A NURSERY
STILL THIS PLAN OF SCHOOL-KEEPING REMAINED UPPERMOST
A WOMAN OF THE NAME OF MRS B IT SEEMS WANTS A TEACHER
THE FIRST GAVE ME PLEASURE THE LAST SOMETHING LIKE PAIN THE NERVOUS DISTURBANCE WHICH IS STATED TO HAVE TROUBLED HER WHILE SHE WAS AT MISS W---'S SEEMS TO HAVE BEGUN TO DISTRESS HER ABOUT THIS TIME
24TH 1848 AGED 30 YEARS
BUT THE REAL FACT IS THAT IT WAS AN ACT OF HUMANITY TO PUT A POOR OLD HORSE OUT OF MISERY
IT IS STIPULATED HOWEVER THAT I SHOULD GIVE UP THE CLEATHORPE SCHEME
I MADE UP MY MIND TO THAT FATE EVER SINCE I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
THE BOOK WAS PRINTED
BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN
DEPEND UPON IT WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SUCH FOR MANY A LONG MONTH TO COME
THIS STRINGENT LETTER MADE HER PUT ASIDE FOR A TIME ALL IDEA OF LITERARY ENTERPRISE
IT IS A CURIOUS POSITION TO BE SO UTTERLY SOLITARY IN THE MIDST OF NUMBERS
INQUIRE FOR A MAN BY HIS CHRISTIAN NAME AND SURNAME AND YOU MAY HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN FINDING HIM
THREE YEARS AFTER THE PERIOD WHEN THEY WERE AT SCHOOL TOGETHER)--"I HEARD THAT SHE HAD GONE AS TEACHER TO MISS W---'S
SO MUCH SO THAT AT LENGTH M
I BEING OF THE FURIOUS RADICAL PARTY TOLD HER HOW COULD ANY OF THEM TRUST ONE ANOTHER
I HAVE SERIOUSLY ENTERED INTO THE ENTERPRISE OF KEEPING A SCHOOL--OR RATHER TAKING A LIMITED NUMBER OF PUPILS AT HOME
SUCH LIGHT AS PIERCED THE CROWDED BOUGHS LIGHT SCATTERED SCANT AND DIM PASSED THROUGH THE FERN THAT FORMED HIS COUCH AND CENTRED FULL ON HIM
NO BURSTS OF VIOLENT EMOTION
HE WAS VERY CLEVER NO DOUBT
BY WHICH I DON'T ALLUDE TO HIS CORPORAL SPINE WHICH IS ALL RIGHT ENOUGH BUT TO HIS CHARACTER
LAST SUNDAY I TOOK UP MY BIBLE IN A GLOOMY STATE OF MIND
AND OFT WITHIN MY CHAMBER LYING HAVE I AWAKED MYSELF WITH CRYING FROM DREAMS WHERE I BEHELD HIM DYING UPON THE ACCURSED TREE
HE BECAME UNPOPULAR THEN AMONG THE MILLWORKERS AND HE ESTEEMED HIS LIFE UNSAFE IF HE TOOK HIS LONG AND LONELY WALKS UNARMED
SHE WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLDER THAN EMILY
ALSO HERE LIE THE REMAINS OF MARIA BRONTE DAUGHTER OF THE AFORESAID
NOT IN A SPIRIT OF EMULATION AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO CELEBRITY
DO PARDON ME SIR THAT I HAVE VENTURED TO COME BEFORE ONE WHOSE WORKS I HAVE MOST LOVED IN OUR LITERATURE AND WHO MOST HAS BEEN WITH ME A DIVINITY OF THE MIND LAYING BEFORE HIM ONE OF MY WRITINGS AND ASKING OF HIM A JUDGMENT OF ITS CONTENTS
CHARLOTTE TOLD ME ONCE THAT BRANWELL HAD DONE SO
AND THOUGH FROM THEIR OWN TESTIMONY HER PATIENCE FIRMNESS AND RESOLUTION AT LENGTH OBTAINED THEIR JUST REWARD YET WITH ONE SO WEAK IN HEALTH AND SPIRITS THE REACTION AFTER SUCH STRUGGLES AS SHE FREQUENTLY HAD WITH HER PUPILS MUST HAVE BEEN VERY SAD AND PAINFUL
I RECOLLECTED THE FABLE OF THE WILLOW AND THE OAK
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT IN THIS WORLD I BELIEVE WHEN THEY ARE NEARLY EQUAL IN AGE AND SIMILAR IN EDUCATION TASTES AND SENTIMENTS
UNFORTUNATELY I HAD RETURNED BY THE OLD ROAD WHILE THEY WERE GONE BY THE NEW AND WE MISSED EACH OTHER
MARY IS PLAYING ON THE PIANO
I FEEL CERTAIN WHILE I AM WRITING THAT YOU WILL SEE THE PROPRIETY OF WHAT I SAY
BUT I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT--IT IS DREARY WORK TO LOOK ON AND LISTEN
AND NOT A WORD MORE WAS SAID ON THE SUBJECT
THE POEMS WILL OCCUPY I SHOULD THINK FROM 200 TO 250 PAGES
THE MASTER OF IT SHE ESPECIALLY REGARDED AS A VALUABLE FRIEND WHOSE ADVICE HELPED TO GUIDE HER IN ONE VERY IMPORTANT STEP OF HER LIFE
HER HEALTH WAS WEAK
I WAS AWARE OF THE DISCREPANCY BUT I DID NOT THINK IT OF SUFFICIENT CONSEQUENCE TO BE RECTIFIED BY AN EXAMINATION OF THE REGISTER OF BIRTHS
BUT I HAVE NOT MET WITH ANY PART OF THAT CORRESPONDENCE
EMILY'S COUNTENANCE STRUCK ME AS FULL OF POWER
AND WHAT HAD BEEN A FOSSE FOR DEFENCE WAS FILLED UP WITH HERB-GARDENS AND ORCHARDS FOR UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED YEARS
SHE REPEATED A VERSE OF ISAIAH WHICH SHE SAID HAD INSPIRED THEM AND WHICH I HAVE FORGOTTEN
MR BRONTE HAS NOW NO TRACE OF HIS IRISH ORIGIN REMAINING IN HIS SPEECH
I DON'T WANT TO WALK ABOUT SO HERE WE ALWAYS DIFFERED
I MUST FORSOOTH HAVE SOME REMOTE HOPE OF ENTRAPPING A HUSBAND SOMEHOW OR SOMEWHERE
IL EST BIEN NATUREL QU'ELLES CHERCHENT A VOUS CONSOLER DE CE QUE LE CIEL VIENT DE VOUS OTER ON SE SERRANT AUTOUR DE VOUS POUI MIEUX VOUS FAIRE APPRECIER CE QUE LE CIEL VOUS A DONNE ET CE QU'IL VOUS LAISSE ENCORE
THE ENCLOSURE IN FRONT HALF COURT HALF GARDEN
THEY SHOW A BLOODY FOOTPRINT IN A BED-CHAMBER OF OAKWELL HALL AND TELL A STORY CONNECTED WITH IT AND WITH THE LANE BY WHICH THE HOUSE IS APPROACHED
YOU ASK ABOUT BRANWELL
YOU ARE FAR TOO KIND AND FREQUENT IN YOUR INVITATIONS
WE WERE OF COURSE MUCH PREOCCUPIED AND OUR PROSPECTS GLOOMY
WHAT THE HEALTHY SUFFER FROM BUT MOMENTARILY AND THEN FORGET THOSE WHO ARE AILING BROOD OVER INVOLUNTARILY AND REMEMBER LONG,--PERHAPS WITH NO RESENTMENT BUT SIMPLY AS A PIECE OF SUFFERING THAT HAS BEEN STAMPED INTO THEIR VERY LIFE
WILL YOU FAVOUR ME WITH A LINE STATING WHETHER ANY OR HOW MANY COPIES HAVE YET BEEN SOLD BUT FEW I FEAR
15
AND WHEN A NOTE IS WRITTEN IT HAS TO BE CARRIED A MILE TO THE POST AND THAT CONSUMES NEARLY AN HOUR WHICH IS A LARGE PORTION OF THE DAY
HEGER IS REPRESENTED AS PROHIBITING THE USE OF DICTIONARY OR GRAMMAR REFERS I IMAGINE TO THE TIME I HAVE MENTIONED WHEN HE DETERMINED TO ADOPT A NEW METHOD OF INSTRUCTION IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE OF WHICH THEY WERE TO CATCH THE SPIRIT AND RHYTHM RATHER FROM THE EAR AND THE HEART AS ITS NOBLEST ACCENTS FELL UPON THEM THAN BY OVER-CAREFUL AND ANXIOUS STUDY OF ITS GRAMMATICAL RULES
SO THAT FOR SOME TIME THEY COULD NOT CONJECTURE THAT ANYTHING THERE MADE HIM SO WILFUL AND RESTLESS AND FULL OF BOTH LEVITY AND MISERY
QUAND ELLE APPROUVE C'EST ASSEZ
SHE ADDED THAT HE WAS ALWAYS GOOD-NATURED TO POOR FOLKS AND SEEMED TO HAVE A DEAL OF FEELING AND KINDHEARTEDNESS ABOUT HIM
AND WHEN WE DO IT IS ONLY TO EXCHANGE THE MOST TRIVIAL AND COMMON-PLACE REMARKS THE MRS B
SHE LIVED THROUGH AN APRIL DAY
AND THIS HABIT OF KEEPER'S WAS SO OBJECTIONABLE THAT EMILY IN REPLY TO TABBY'S REMONSTRANCES DECLARED THAT IF HE WAS FOUND AGAIN TRANSGRESSING SHE HERSELF IN DEFIANCE OF WARNING AND HIS WELL-KNOWN FEROCITY OF NATURE WOULD BEAT HIM SO SEVERELY THAT HE WOULD NEVER OFFEND AGAIN
THE BRINGING OUT OF OUR LITTLE BOOK WAS HARD WORK
MRS BRONTE DIED IN SEPTEMBER 1821 AND THE LIVES OF THOSE QUIET CHILDREN MUST HAVE BECOME QUIETER AND LONELIER STILL
PAPA AND AUNT TALK BY FITS AND STARTS OF OUR--ID EST EMILY ANNE AND MYSELF--COMMENCING A SCHOOL
I CANNOT CONJECTURE THE REASON OF THIS LONG SILENCE UNLESS SOME UNFORESEEN IMPEDIMENT HAS OCCURRED IN CONCLUDING THE BARGAIN
SHE HERSELF WAS BORN AND BRED AMONG THIS ROUGH STRONG FIERCE SET AND KNEW THE DEPTH OF GOODNESS AND LOYALTY THAT LAY BENEATH THEIR WILD MANNERS AND INSUBORDINATE WAYS
THE PUPILS ALL APPEAR IN THE SAME DRESS
I HAVE GOT ON VERY WELL WITH THE SERVANTS AND CHILDREN SO FAR
SMUGGLING WAS CARRIED ON TO A GREAT EXTENT
AND FROM KNOWING NOTHING OF THE GAIETY AND THE SPORTIVENESS OF CHILDHOOD--FROM NEVER HAVING EXPERIENCED CARESSES OR FOND ATTENTIONS THEMSELVES--THEY WERE IGNORANT OF THE VERY NATURE OF INFANCY OR HOW TO CALL OUT ITS ENGAGING QUALITIES
THE REAL EVENTS WHICH SUGGESTED IT TOOK PLACE IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD
AND AS LONG AS WE CAN REGARD THOSE WE LOVE AND TO WHOM WE ARE CLOSELY ALLIED WITH PROFOUND AND NEVER-SHAKEN ESTEEM IT IS A SMALL THING THAT THEY SHOULD VEX US OCCASIONALLY BY WHAT APPEAR TO US UNREASONABLE AND HEADSTRONG NOTIONS
SHE WAS AS GOOD AS A MOTHER TO HER SISTERS AND BROTHER
AND YET ANY ONE MIGHT DROP A STONE INTO IT FROM THE BACK WINDOWS OF THE GRAND MODERN HOTELS IN THE RUE ROYALE BUILT AND FURNISHED IN THE NEWEST PARISIAN FASHION
WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS ENJOYING THE PLEASURES OF A FETE DAY WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND SHE KNEW I WAS QUITE BY MYSELF AND NEVER TOOK THE LEAST NOTICE OF ME
WAS GOING ON CHARLOTTE WENT TO VISIT HER OLD SCHOOL-FRIEND WITH WHOM SHE WAS IN SUCH HABITS OF CONFIDENTIAL INTIMACY
BUT AT PRESENT HOWEVER TEMPTED TO TAKE SUCH A STEP I SHOULD NOT FEEL JUSTIFIED IN DOING SO
SHE SAID THAT AT COWAN BRIDGE SHE USED TO STAND IN THE BURN ON A STONE TO WATCH THE WATER FLOW BY
AN EXTRAORDINARY DREAM BY LORD C
THEIR ACCOST IS CURT
AND LASTLY THE MAJORITY OF ONE TO FOUR SIC IN FAVOUR OF THE BILL
THE RUE D'ISABELLE LOOKS AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN UNTOUCHED BY THE INNOVATIONS OF THE BUILDER FOR THE LAST THREE CENTURIES
SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST PROVIDE FOR HERSELF AND CHOSE HER TRADE
IT STANDS IN THE MIDST OF FIELDS AND THE DAMP MIST MUST HAVE GATHERED ROUND THE WALLS AND CREPT IN AT THE WINDOWS
ANNE C IT SEEMS IS DEAD
SOME ONE PRESENT MADE AN ALLUSION TO A SIMILAR CHILDISH DISLIKE IN THE TRUE TALE OF THE TERRIBLE KNITTERS O DENT GIVEN IN SOUTHEY'S COMMON-PLACE BOOK AND SHE SMILED FAINTLY BUT SAID THAT THE MERE DIFFERENCE IN FOOD WAS NOT ALL
THE ELDEST SON IF NOT ALLOWED TO REMAIN AN IDLE COUNTRY SQUIRE WAS SENT TO OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE PREPARATORY TO HIS ENGAGING IN ONE OF THE THREE LIBERAL PROFESSIONS OF DIVINITY LAW OR PHYSIC
MY HEALTH AND SPIRITS HAD UTTERLY FAILED ME AND THE MEDICAL MAN WHOM I CONSULTED ENJOINED ME AS I VALUED MY LIFE TO GO HOME
THERE WERE HORSE-RACES HELD ON THE MOORS JUST ABOVE THE VILLAGE WHICH WERE PERIODICAL SOURCES OF DRUNKENNESS AND PROFLIGACY
THE OTHER DAY THEY ALL THREE ACCOMPANIED BY MR S DROPPED OR RATHER RUSHED IN UNEXPECTEDLY TO TEA
HAVE BEEN GONE A WEEK
THEY WOULD LEARN
IT IS JUST SUCH A NEIGHBOURHOOD AS THE MONKS LOVED AND TRACES OF THE OLD PLANTAGENET TIMES ARE TO BE MET WITH EVERYWHERE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE MANUFACTURING INTERESTS OF THE WEST RIDING OF TO-DAY
ALL IS BUSTLE AND CONFUSION ROUND ME THE LADIES PRESSING WITH THEIR SUMS AND THEIR LESSONS IF YOU LOVE ME DO DO DO COME ON FRIDAY
THERE WERE SYMPTOMS OF A QUIET BUT STURDY REBELLION THAT WINTER AFTERNOON IN THE SMALL PRECINCTS OF HAWORTH PARSONAGE
11
MY SPIRITS ARE UNEQUAL AND SOMETIMES I SPEAK VEHEMENTLY AND SOMETIMES I SAY NOTHING AT ALL
ABOUT THIS TIME AN ELDERLY WOMAN OF THE VILLAGE CAME TO LIVE AS SERVANT AT THE PARSONAGE
BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS--THE ESTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION--WILL WEAR AWAY ABOUT THIS TIME SHE FORGOT TO RETURN A WORK-BAG SHE HAD BORROWED BY A MESSENGER AND IN REPAIRING HER ERROR SHE SAYS:--"THESE ABERRATIONS OF MEMORY WARN ME PRETTY INTELLIGIBLY THAT I AM GETTING PAST MY PRIME AETAT 21
YET I NEVER HAVE PRESSED YOU AND NEVER WOULD PRESS YOU TOO WARMLY TO COME
THEY STRUCK EATING TILL THE RESOLUTION WAS RESCINDED AND TABBY WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN A HELPLESS INVALID ENTIRELY DEPENDENT UPON THEM
SHE WAS COMING TO SCHOOL AT MISS W---'S
AND THE GIRLS ALL RETURNED TO THEIR ALLEGIANCE EXCEPT MARY WHO TOOK HER OWN WAY DURING THE WEEK OR TWO THAT REMAINED OF THE HALF-YEAR CHOOSING TO CONSIDER THAT MISS W IN GIVING CHARLOTTE BRONTE SO LONG A TASK HAD FORFEITED HER CLAIM TO OBEDIENCE OF THE SCHOOL REGULATIONS
ON THE 23RD OF THE MONTH SHE WRITES AS FOLLOWS EVERY ONE ASKS ME WHAT I AM GOING TO DO NOW THAT I AM RETURNED HOME
AS TO GETTING INTO DEBT THAT IS A THING WE COULD NONE OF US RECONCILE OUR MIND TO FOR A MOMENT
THE MORALITY OF SHAKSPEARE NEEDED THE CONFIRMATION OF CHARLOTTE'S OPINION TO THE SENSITIVE E AND A LITTLE LATER SHE INQUIRED WHETHER DANCING WAS OBJECTIONABLE WHEN INDULGED IN FOR AN HOUR OR TWO IN PARTIES OF BOYS AND GIRLS
THE SISTERS OFTEN LISTENED FOR THE REPORT OF A PISTOL IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT TILL WATCHFUL EYE AND HEARKENING EAR GREW HEAVY AND DULL WITH THE PERPETUAL STRAIN UPON THEIR NERVES
APRIL 2ND 1845
AND THAT FOURTEEN GENTLEMEN SHARED IN THE CHASE AND DINED ON THE SPOIL IN THAT HALL ALONG WITH FAIRFAX FEARNELEY ESQ THE OWNER
THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON'S ADVENTURE IN THE CAVERN
DON'T FANCY I AM NOT BUT I HAVE ONE ACHING FEELING AT MY HEART I MUST ALLUDE TO IT THOUGH I HAD RESOLVED NOT TO IT IS ABOUT ANNE
HE WAS QUITE AWARE OF HIS UNPOPULARITY AND OF THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES
IN FUTURE TO DIRECT TO HER REAL ADDRESS MISS BRONTE C
AT FIRST I COULD NOT SAY THY WILL BE DONE I FELT REBELLIOUS BUT I KNEW IT WAS WRONG TO FEEL SO
DO NOT THEREFORE BE TOO MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING YOURSELF AS YOU ARE AFFECTIONATE AND GOOD-HEARTED
I DO NOT MEAN OF COURSE TO STAY BUT JUST FOR A CALL OF AN HOUR OR TWO
NO MATTER IF THE DESIRED END WERE FAR AWAY
FOR NOT ONLY HIS TORY POLITICS BUT HIS LOVE AND REGARD FOR THE AUTHORITY OF THE LAW MADE HIM DESPISE THE COWARDICE OF THE SURROUNDING MAGISTRATES WHO IN THEIR DREAD OF THE LUDDITES REFUSED TO INTERFERE SO AS TO PREVENT THE DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY
ABSURD ABSURD
AT LEAST SHE HERSELF SPEAKS OF HER IRRITABLE CONDITION WHICH WAS CERTAINLY ONLY A TEMPORARY AILMENT
BUT AS THE ROAD BEGINS TO ASCEND THE VEGETATION BECOMES POORER
IT IS A LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF ONE OF THE LITTLE MAGAZINES SIR,--IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE GENII HAVE DECLARED THAT UNLESS THEY PERFORM CERTAIN ARDUOUS DUTIES EVERY YEAR OF A MYSTERIOUS NATURE ALL THE WORLDS IN THE FIRMAMENT WILL BE BURNT UP AND GATHERED TOGETHER IN ONE MIGHTY GLOBE WHICH WILL ROLL IN SOLITARY GRANDEUR THROUGH THE VAST WILDERNESS OF SPACE INHABITED ONLY BY THE FOUR HIGH PRINCES OF THE GENII TILL TIME SHALL BE SUCCEEDED BY ETERNITY
COLLATERAL DESCENDANTS SUCCEEDED AND LEFT THIS PICTURESQUE TRACE OF THEIR HAVING BEEN
BUT A HUNDRED THINGS I HAD TO SAY TO YOU WILL NOW BE FORGOTTEN AND NEVER SAID
HER FATHER'S EYESIGHT BEGAN TO FAIL
IN THE FIRST PLACE IT SELDOM OR NEVER MEETS WITH A REQUITAL
OUR POOR OLD SERVANT TABBY HAD A SORT OF FIT A FORTNIGHT SINCE BUT IS NEARLY RECOVERED NOW
THERE IS ONLY ONE CLOUD IN THE SKY
TO TAKE A GIG FROM HAWORTH TO B WOULD BE TO ME A VERY SERIOUS INCREASE OF EXPENSE AND I HAPPEN TO BE VERY LOW IN CASH
NOT THAT IT IS A CRIME TO MARRY OR A CRIME TO WISH TO BE MARRIED
MR HUNTER IN HIS LIFE OF OLIVER HEYWOOD QUOTES A SENTENCE OUT OF A MEMORIAL OF ONE JAMES RITHER LIVING IN THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH WHICH IS PARTIALLY TRUE TO THIS DAY THEY HAVE NO SUPERIOR TO COURT NO CIVILITIES TO PRACTISE
AND MADAME HEGER PRESIDING
MY PLANS FOR THE FUTURE ARE BOUNDED TO THIS INTENTION
I SHALL NOW QUOTE FROM A VALUABLE LETTER WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED FROM MARY ONE OF THESE EARLY FRIENDS
BUT SHE WOULD FOLLOW OUT M
THERE WAS A ROBUST FREEDOM IN THE OUT-OF-DOORS LIFE OF HER COMPANIONS
THE PARSONAGE STANDS AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE ROAD FACING DOWN UPON THE CHURCH
THERE HE WAS MARRIED AND HIS TWO CHILDREN MARIA AND ELIZABETH WERE BORN
YOU WOULD THEN THINK OF ME AFTERWARDS WITH THE MORE GOOD-WILL BECAUSE YOU WOULD PERCEIVE THAT THERE IS NEITHER SEVERITY NOR MOROSENESS IN THE STATE OF MIND TO WHICH YEARS AND OBSERVATION HAVE BROUGHT ME
SHE NEVER GAVE DECIDED OPINIONS AT SUCH TIMES CHARLOTTE SAID SHE COULD GET ON WITH ANY ONE WHO HAD A BUMP AT THE TOP OF THEIR HEADS MEANING CONSCIENTIOUSNESS I FOUND THAT I SELDOM DIFFERED FROM HER EXCEPT THAT SHE WAS FAR TOO TOLERANT OF STUPID PEOPLE IF THEY HAD A GRAIN OF KINDNESS IN THEM IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT MR BRONTE PROVIDED HIS CHILDREN WITH A TEACHER IN DRAWING WHO TURNED OUT TO BE A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE TALENT BUT VERY LITTLE PRINCIPLE
IT GIVES AN APPALLING ACCOUNT OF HER DUTIES
WHEN I SAW MISS BRANWELL SHE WAS A VERY PRECISE PERSON AND LOOKED VERY ODD BECAUSE HER DRESS C WAS SO UTTERLY OUT OF FASHION
THAT THE PUPILS LOOKED BRIGHT HAPPY AND WELL AND THAT THE LADY SUPERINTENDENT WAS A MOST PREPOSSESSING LOOKING PERSON WHO ON MY MAKING SOME INQUIRY AS TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS TAUGHT TO THE PUPILS SAID THAT THE SCHEME OF EDUCATION WAS MATERIALLY CHANGED SINCE THE SCHOOL HAD BEEN OPENED
I TELL THEM THE RETIRED SITUATION IS IN SOME POINTS OF VIEW AN ADVANTAGE
HOW DO YOU GET ON
THERE IS ONE LITTLE TRAIT RESPECTING MR W
AT LAST THEY CAME TO A DETERMINATION
I HAVE NOT THE FACULTY OF TELLING AN INDIVIDUAL'S DISPOSITION AT FIRST SIGHT
MISS BRANWELL INSTRUCTED THE CHILDREN AT REGULAR HOURS IN ALL SHE COULD TEACH MAKING HER BED-CHAMBER INTO THEIR SCHOOLROOM
CITIES IN THE WILDERNESS LIKE TADMOR ALIAS PALMYRA--ARE THEY NOT
I PRAY WITH HEART AND SOUL THAT ALL MAY CONTINUE WELL AT HAWORTH
I HAVE WRITTEN TO YOU SOON THAT YOU MIGHT NOT LOOK AFTER THE POSTMAN IN VAIN
AYLOTT WILL ADVISE HER AS TO THE REVIEWERS TO WHOM COPIES OUGHT TO BE SENT
ANY OVER-DEMONSTRATIVE KINDNESS WOULD HAVE SCARED THE WILD LITTLE MAIDEN FROM HAWORTH
FOR THE SAKE OF UNIFORMITY THEREFORE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO BRING 3_L
BUT IN THE BRANWELL FAMILY ITSELF THE VIOLENCE AND IRREGULARITY OF NATURE DID NOT EXIST
SA VIE C'EST L'ARC EN CIEL
LE CHENE CROIT LENTEMENT
HEGER TOOK ME AND ONE OF THE PUPILS INTO THE TOWN TO SEE THE MASKS
FEARLESS YET RELIANT ON ANY WHO WILL HELP HER
THAT IS I HAVE BEGUN IN GOOD EARNEST TO SEEK FOR PUPILS
CHARLOTTE SAW EMILY'S WHITENING FACE AND SET MOUTH BUT DARED NOT SPEAK TO INTERFERE
IT WAS SUSPENDED TO A POLE AND SERVED FOR A MARK AT WHICH THE COMPETITORS DISCHARGED THEIR FUSEES AND CARBINES IN ROTATION AT THE DISTANCE OF SEVENTY PACES
I HAVE NO DESIRE AT ALL TO SEE YOUR CURATE
I THOUGHT THEY HAD GOT ENOUGH FOR ONE WHILE BUT IT WAS NOTHING TO THE DOSE THAT WAS THRUST DOWN THEIR THROATS IN THE EVENING
ON ONE OCCASION THE EFFECT WAS SUCH THAT SHE WAS LED TO SCREAM OUT ALOUD AND MISS W COMING UP STAIRS FOUND THAT ONE OF THE LISTENERS HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH VIOLENT PALPITATIONS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXCITEMENT PRODUCED BY CHARLOTTE'S STORY
AT HER BETTER TIMES BEGGING HER NURSE TO RAISE HER IN BED TO LET HER SEE HER CLEAN THE GRATE BECAUSE SHE DID IT AS IT WAS DONE IN CORNWALL DEVOTEDLY FOND OF HER HUSBAND WHO WARMLY REPAID HER AFFECTION AND SUFFERED NO ONE ELSE TO TAKE THE NIGHT-NURSING
TOUTE AUTRE LOUANGE L'OBSEDE
EMILY WAS THE PRETTIEST MRS BRONTE WAS THE SAME PATIENT CHEERFUL PERSON AS WE HAVE SEEN HER FORMERLY
GOD BLESS HER
WILL TAKE THIS LETTER TO ENGLAND
BUT THE CASE WAS ENTIRELY ALTERED WHEN AT MR CHARNOCK'S DEATH IN 1819 THEY CONCEIVED THAT THE TRUSTEES HAD BEEN UNJUSTLY DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHTS BY THE VICAR OF BRADFORD WHO APPOINTED MR REDHEAD AS PERPETUAL CURATE
DO YOU REMEMBER WHETHER THERE WAS ANY OTHER SCHOOL THERE BESIDES THAT OF MISS
I WENT TO SEE HER AND ASKED HOW SHE COULD GIVE SO MUCH FOR SO LITTLE MONEY WHEN SHE COULD LIVE WITHOUT IT
CONSTANTLY READING AND LEARNING
THEN AND NOT TILL THEN SHE CONFIDED HER PLAN TO AN INTIMATE FRIEND
FEB
FEB
20
BUT SHE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED BY THE IDEA OF ARRIVING AT AN HOUR WHICH TO YORKSHIRE NOTIONS WAS SO LATE AND UNSEEMLY
SOON AFTER SHE CAME BACK TO HAWORTH IN A LETTER TO ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN STAYING THERE OCCURS THIS PASSAGE:--"OUR POOR LITTLE CAT HAS BEEN ILL TWO DAYS AND IS JUST DEAD
13
IT WAS A GROUP OF HIS SISTERS LIFE-SIZE THREE-QUARTERS LENGTH
I AM NOT SURPRISED AT YOUR DIFFICULTY IN AUTHENTICATING MATTER-OF-FACT
THE FINEST PASSAGES ARE ALWAYS THE PUREST THE BAD ARE INVARIABLY REVOLTING
YARDS OF CAMBRIC TO HEM MUSLIN NIGHTCAPS TO MAKE AND ABOVE ALL THINGS DOLLS TO DRESS
SOME HUNDREDS OF STARVING CLOTH-DRESSERS ASSEMBLED IN THE VERY FIELD NEAR KIRKLEES THAT SLOPED DOWN FROM THE HOUSE WHICH MISS W AFTERWARDS INHABITED AND WERE ARMED BY THEIR LEADERS WITH PISTOLS HATCHETS AND BLUDGEONS MANY OF WHICH HAD BEEN EXTORTED BY THE NIGHTLY BANDS THAT PROWLED ABOUT THE COUNTRY FROM SUCH INHABITANTS OF LONELY HOUSES AS HAD PROVIDED THEMSELVES WITH THESE MEANS OF SELF-DEFENCE
MINE WAS THE PRETTIEST OF THE WHOLE AND THE TALLEST AND THE MOST PERFECT IN EVERY PART
AND ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS BOTH MARY AND SHE USED TO CALL UPON CHARLOTTE AND OFTEN ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE HER TO RETURN WITH THEM AND BE THE GUEST OF ONE OF THEM TILL MONDAY MORNING
HE BOUGHT SPLENDID ENGRAVINGS OF THE PICTURES WHICH HE PARTICULARLY ADMIRED AND HIS HOUSE WAS FULL OF WORKS OF ART AND OF BOOKS
WILLIAM GRIMSHAW CURATE OF HAWORTH FOR TWENTY YEARS
I CAN NEITHER READ WRITE NOR DRAW WITH COMFORT IN THEIR ABSENCE
I ALLUDE TO THE SUBJECT AGAIN HERE IN ORDER THAT THE READER MAY REMEMBER THE GNAWING PRIVATE CARES WHICH SHE HAD TO BURY IN HER OWN HEART
THE ATTACKS OF ILL HEALTH TO WHICH MR BRONTE HAD BEEN SUBJECT OF LATE YEARS RENDERED IT NOT ONLY NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD TAKE HIS DINNER ALONE FOR THE SAKE OF AVOIDING TEMPTATIONS TO UNWHOLESOME DIET BUT MADE IT ALSO DESIRABLE THAT HE SHOULD PASS THE TIME DIRECTLY SUCCEEDING HIS MEALS IN PERFECT QUIET
ALTHOUGH BEFORE THEY HAD BEEN READY ENOUGH TO STONE HIM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN WHAT THEY CONSIDERED TO BE THEIR RIGHTS
29 1837
HE'S LET FLY AT SOME FOLK'S LEGS AND LET SHOT LODGE IN EM AFORE NOW FOR GOING TOO NEAR TO HIS HOUSE AND FINDING ON CLOSER INQUIRY THAT SUCH WAS REALLY THE INHOSPITABLE CUSTOM OF THIS MOORLAND SQUIRE THE GENTLEMAN GAVE UP HIS PURPOSE
EMILY RARELY SPOKE TO ANY ONE
HIS TALENTS WERE CERTAINLY VERY BRILLIANT AND OF THIS HE WAS FULLY CONSCIOUS AND FERVENTLY DESIRED BY THEIR USE EITHER IN WRITING OR DRAWING TO MAKE HIMSELF A NAME
THE GAMES OF FOOT-BALL ON SUNDAYS WITH THE CHALLENGES TO THE NEIGHBOURING PARISHES WERE RESUMED BRINGING IN AN INFLUX OF RIOTOUS STRANGERS TO FILL THE PUBLIC-HOUSES AND MAKE THE MORE SOBER-MINDED INHABITANTS LONG FOR GOOD MR GRIMSHAW'S STOUT ARM AND READY HORSEWHIP
TURN IT AND KEEP IT SEVEN YEAR LONGER THAT IT MAY BE EVER READY TO THINE HAND WHEN THINE ENEMY DRAWS NEAR THE WEST RIDING MEN ARE SLEUTH-HOUNDS IN PURSUIT OF MONEY
I AM A FOOL
I'M OBLIGED TO YOU ALSO MORE FOR YOUR NOTE THAN FOR YOUR PRESENT
THE KIND MOTHERLY NATURE OF MISS W AND THE SMALL NUMBER OF THE GIRLS MADE THE ESTABLISHMENT MORE LIKE A PRIVATE FAMILY THAN A SCHOOL
IT SEEMS TO ME A DARING EXPERIMENT ON THE PART OF THEIR TEACHER
THIS MANSION WAS PLACED IN FRONT OF THEIR EXERCISE-GROUND AND WAS OF A SQUARE SHAPE
ON THE DEEPLY SHADOWED SIDE WAS EMILY WITH ANNE'S GENTLE FACE RESTING ON HER SHOULDER
AND AUNT MEANT WELL TOO I DARE SAY BUT I AM PROVOKED THAT SHE RESERVED THE EXPRESSION OF HER DECIDED DISAPPROVAL TILL ALL WAS SETTLED BETWEEN YOU AND MYSELF
I CONSIDER METHODISM QUAKERISM AND THE EXTREMES OF HIGH AND LOW CHURCHISM FOOLISH BUT ROMAN CATHOLICISM BEATS THEM ALL
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER MISS BRANWELL TAUGHT HER NIECES ANYTHING BESIDES SEWING AND THE HOUSEHOLD ARTS IN WHICH CHARLOTTE AFTERWARDS WAS SUCH AN ADEPT
IDLE SHE NEVER WAS IN ANY PLACE BUT OF THE MULTITUDE OF SMALL TALKS PLANS DUTIES PLEASURES C THAT MAKE UP MOST PEOPLE'S DAYS HER HOME LIFE WAS NEARLY DESTITUTE
IN THE DAYTIME IT IS A PUBLIC ROOM WHERE MUSIC-MASTERS AND MISTRESSES ARE CONSTANTLY PASSING IN AND OUT
I SUFFERED MUCH BEFORE I LEFT BRUSSELS
THE NUMBER OF PUPILS DURING THE YEAR AND A HALF MISS BRONTE WAS THERE RANGED FROM SEVEN TO TEN
MR T
MR T
I SEE THE TRUTH OF THIS OBSERVATION DAILY PROVED
IS GOING TO BE MARRIED IS HE
BUT AFTER A LITTLE REFLECTION I DETERMINED TO SUMMON WHAT ENERGY I HAD AND TO WEATHER THE STORM
IT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLES MARTHA'S
I QUITE WEARIED MY EYES WITH WATCHING FROM THE WINDOW EYE-GLASS IN HAND AND SOMETIMES SPECTACLES ON NOSE
WE UNDERSTOOD BUT LITTLE OF IT
FOR IT IS NECESSARY HE OBSERVED BEFORE SITTING DOWN TO WRITE ON A SUBJECT TO HAVE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT IT
IT IS NOT BECAUSE I HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT I WAS ONCE YOUNG MYSELF THAT I WRITE TO YOU IN THIS STRAIN
AND THEN I GOT THE HABIT WHICH I HAVE YET OF REFERRING MENTALLY TO HER OPINION ON ALL MATTERS OF THAT KIND ALONG WITH MANY MORE RESOLVING TO DESCRIBE SUCH AND SUCH THINGS TO HER UNTIL I START AT THE RECOLLECTION THAT I NEVER SHALL TO FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF THIS LAST SENTENCE--TO SHOW HOW STEADY AND VIVID WAS THE IMPRESSION WHICH MISS BRONTE MADE ON THOSE FITTED TO APPRECIATE HER--I MUST MENTION THAT THE WRITER OF THIS LETTER DATED JANUARY 18TH 1856 IN WHICH SHE THUS SPEAKS OF CONSTANTLY REFERRING TO CHARLOTTE'S OPINION HAS NEVER SEEN HER FOR ELEVEN YEARS NEARLY ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN PASSED AMONG STRANGE SCENES IN A NEW CONTINENT AT THE ANTIPODES
HOWEVER NO REPINING
BUT I PRESUME THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE IMMATERIAL
NEVER MIND
NEVER MIND
IF THE VOLUME WAS TO BE PUBLISHED AT THEIR OWN RISK IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE SISTER CONDUCTING THE NEGOTIATION SHOULD MAKE HERSELF ACQUAINTED WITH THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TYPE AND THE VARIOUS SIZES OF BOOKS
MY AIM SIR IS TO PUSH OUT INTO THE OPEN WORLD AND FOR THIS I TRUST NOT POETRY ALONE--THAT MIGHT LAUNCH THE VESSEL BUT COULD NOT BEAR HER ON
AND I HAVE DONE NOTHING YET
MY FEARS WERE NOT IN VAIN
AS TEACHING SEEMED THE ONLY PROFESSION OPEN TO THEM AND AS IT APPEARED THAT EMILY AT LEAST COULD NOT LIVE AWAY FROM HOME WHILE THE OTHERS ALSO SUFFERED MUCH FROM THE SAME CAUSE THIS PLAN OF SCHOOL-KEEPING PRESENTED ITSELF AS MOST DESIRABLE
SHE PAID OCCASIONAL VISITS TO HER TWO GREAT FRIENDS AND THEY IN RETURN CAME TO HAWORTH
THEIR FATHER WAS IN THE HABIT OF RELATING TO THEM ANY PUBLIC NEWS IN WHICH HE FELT AN INTEREST
CHAMBERS OF EDINBURGH FOR A WORD OF ADVICE
IL FAUT EN FINIR AVEC NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE
THERE ARE A HUNDRED REASONS WHY IT SHOULD BE AN IMPRACTICABLE ONE
MARY SAYS

COMPULSION THEY DEFY
PROMETHEE AVAIT VOULU ETRE DIEU ET CREATEUR
DELIVERED A NOBLE ELOQUENT HIGH-CHURCH APOSTOLICAL-SUCCESSION DISCOURSE IN WHICH HE BANGED THE DISSENTERS MOST FEARLESSLY AND UNFLINCHINGLY
I DID NOT INTEND IT AND HAVE ONLY ONE THING MORE TO SAY--IF YOU DO NOT GO IMMEDIATELY TO THE SEA WILL YOU COME TO SEE US AT HAWORTH
A KEENER CLEVERER BOLDER AND MORE HEART STIRRING HARANGUE THAN THAT WHICH MR C
THEIR REGULAR LESSONS WERE SAID TO THEIR FATHER

THE CHILDREN RESPECTED HER AND HAD THAT SORT OF AFFECTION FOR HER WHICH IS GENERATED BY ESTEEM
SHE ATE NO ANIMAL FOOD AT SCHOOL
LIVED WITHIN A COUPLE OF MILES OF ROE HEAD WHILE SHE WAS AT SCHOOL THERE
COMPLETED JUNE 31ST 1829
THE WIND CANNOT REST
THE OLD HILL-SPIRIT LINGERS IN THEM WHICH COINED THE RHYME INSCRIBED ON THE UNDER PART OF ONE OF THE SEATS IN THE SEDILIA OF WHALLEY ABBEY NOT MANY MILES FROM HAWORTH WHO MELLS WI WHAT ANOTHER DOES HAD BEST GO HOME AND SHOE HIS GOOSE I ASKED AN INHABITANT OF A DISTRICT CLOSE TO HAWORTH WHAT SORT OF A CLERGYMAN THEY HAD AT THE CHURCH WHICH HE ATTENDED
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS STATE OF THINGS WORKING DOWN WITH SHARP EDGE INTO A SENSITIVE MIND SHE SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED TO THAT LADY HER IMMEDIATE INTENTION OF RETURNING TO ENGLAND
AND AS HER FAITH IN HER FRIEND'S STABILITY IS RESTORED HER OWN IMAGINATION IS DEEPLY MOVED BY THE IDEA OF WHAT GREAT WONDERS ARE TO BE SEEN IN THAT VAST AND FAMOUS CITY
THE POEMS TO BE NEATLY DONE UP IN CLOTH
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING OF MISS H
IT WAS A DEBT SHE OWED ME FOR THE SERVICE I HAD DONE HER I SHOULD THINK 10_L
BUT HER LONDON--HER GREAT APOCRYPHAL CITY--WAS THE TOWN OF A CENTURY BEFORE TO WHICH GIDDY DAUGHTERS DRAGGED UNWILLING PAPAS OR WENT WITH INJUDICIOUS FRIENDS TO THE DETRIMENT OF ALL THEIR BETTER QUALITIES AND SOMETIMES TO THE RUIN OF THEIR FORTUNES
SOME OF MY GREATEST DIFFICULTIES LIE IN THINGS THAT WOULD APPEAR TO YOU COMPARATIVELY TRIVIAL
ONE OUGHT INDEED TO HOPE TO THE VERY LAST
I LIKE MR
AND IT SEEMS AS IF I OUGHT TO BE WORKING AND BRAVING THE ROUGH REALITIES OF THE WORLD AS OTHER PEOPLE DO
AND YET SHE HAD FAULTS SO ANNOYING THAT SHE WAS IN CONSTANT DISGRACE WITH HER TEACHERS AND AN OBJECT OF MERCILESS DISLIKE TO ONE OF THEM WHO IS DEPICTED AS MISS SCATCHERD IN JANE EYRE AND WHOSE REAL NAME I WILL BE MERCIFUL ENOUGH NOT TO DISCLOSE
MORNING AFTER MORNING OF THE HOLIDAYS SLIPPED AWAY AND THERE WAS NO ANSWER
I BEGIN TO SUSPECT I AM WRITING IN A STRAIN WHICH WILL MAKE YOU THINK I AM UNHAPPY
WHENEVER AN OPPORTUNITY OFFERED OF EXAMINING A PICTURE OR CUT OF ANY KIND SHE WENT OVER IT PIECEMEAL WITH HER EYES CLOSE TO THE PAPER LOOKING SO LONG THAT WE USED TO ASK HER WHAT SHE SAW IN IT SHE COULD ALWAYS SEE PLENTY AND EXPLAINED IT VERY WELL
PAPA WAS MUCH CHEERED BY MY REPORT OF MR C.'S OPINION AND OF OLD MRS E.'S EXPERIENCE
AUNT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER SHE SAYS TO DEFER IT UNTIL ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER AS THE WINTER AND EVEN THE SPRING SEASONS ARE REMARKABLY COLD AND BLEAK AMONG OUR MOUNTAINS THE FIRST IMPRESSION MADE ON THE VISITOR BY THE SISTERS OF HER SCHOOL FRIEND WAS THAT EMILY WAS A TALL LONG-ARMED GIRL MORE FULLY GROWN THAN HER ELDER SISTER
THINGS ARE NOT SETTLED
YET THESE REAL MATERIAL DANGERS WHEN ONCE PAST LEAVE IN THE MIND THE SATISFACTION OF HAVING STRUGGLED WITH DIFFICULTY AND OVERCOME IT
BUT I STAYED AS LONG AS I WAS ABLE AND AT LENGTH I NEITHER COULD NOR DARED STAY ANY LONGER
WHAT THERE MAY BE OF THIS IS FURNISHED BY THE WARES IN THE SHOPS NOT BY FOLIAGE OR ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS
SHE DIED MARCH 31ST 1855 IN THE 39TH YEAR OF HER AGE
ON THE NIGHT OF SATURDAY THE 11TH OF APRIL 1812 THE ASSAULT WAS MADE
BUT IT'S ALL OVER WITH ME CHAPTER XIV IN THE COURSE OF THIS SAD AUTUMN OF 1845 A NEW INTEREST CAME UP
THE CAUTION IN ASCERTAINING THE RISK BEFORE EMBARKING IN THE ENTERPRISE AND THE PROMPT PAYMENT OF THE MONEY REQUIRED EVEN BEFORE IT COULD BE SAID TO HAVE ASSUMED THE SHAPE OF A DEBT WERE BOTH PARTS OF A SELF-RELIANT AND INDEPENDENT CHARACTER
ON HER ALSO I HAVE ACTUALLY MADE BOLD TO CALL
AND WOULD HAVE PROUDLY LAID DOWN HIS LIFE ANY DAY FOR WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT AND TRUE
SHE REMEMBERED HOW ANXIOUSLY HER DEAR SISTER MARIA HAD STRIVEN IN HER GRAVE EARNEST WAY TO BE A TENDER HELPER AND A COUNSELLOR TO THEM ALL
REMAINED ONE NIGHT AT MR JENKINS
AS FOR CORRECTING THEM I QUICKLY FOUND THAT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
MY SPIRITS QUITE FAILED ME AT FIRST
THUS HIS WHOLE NATURE WAS ATTRACTED TOWARDS THE METROPOLIS
I DID GO ON MONDAY AFTERNOON AND FOUND HER ON HER WAY TO THAT BOURN WHENCE NO TRAVELLER RETURNS AFTER SITTING WITH HER SOME TIME I HAPPENED TO ASK HER MOTHER IF SHE THOUGHT A LITTLE PORT WINE WOULD DO HER GOOD
I AM CERTAINLY DOOMED TO BE AN OLD MAID
WE FULLY EXPECT HIM HOWEVER NEXT SATURDAY
EMILY IS SORRY THESE FEW WORDS RELATE TO POINTS IN THE CHARACTERS OF THE TWO SISTERS WHICH I MUST DWELL UPON A LITTLE
ABOUT THIS TIME SHE WOULD TURN SICK AND TREMBLING AT ANY SUDDEN NOISE AND COULD HARDLY REPRESS HER SCREAMS WHEN STARTLED
THIS HOWEVER I CANNOT DO
WITH MUCH MORE TO THE SAME EFFECT
HE LIVED TO BE A VERY OLD MAN DYING SOME TIME NEARER TO 1840 THAN 1830
I KNOW WE HAVE TALENTS AND I WANT THEM TO BE TURNED TO ACCOUNT
THE FUNDS HOWEVER FROM WHICH THE CLERGYMAN'S STIPEND MAINLY PROCEEDS ARE VESTED IN THE HANDS OF TRUSTEES WHO HAVE THE POWER TO WITHHOLD THEM IF A NOMINEE IS SENT OF WHOM THEY DISAPPROVE
AND WHEN YOU SEE ME NEXT I SHALL CERTAINLY WEAR CAPS AND SPECTACLES CHAPTER XI I AM NOT AWARE OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED TO THE RELINQUISHMENT OF THE LILLE PLAN
AND HENCEFORWARD THE FOOD WAS SO WELL PREPARED THAT NO ONE COULD EVER REASONABLY COMPLAIN OF IT
I SEE YOU ARE IN A DILEMMA AND ONE OF A PECULIAR AND DIFFICULT NATURE
I'VE BEEN TO SEE A POOR YOUNG GIRL WHO I'M AFRAID IS DYING INDEED
THE INVALIDS WERE ATTENDED BY DR BATTY A VERY CLEVER SURGEON IN KIRBY WHO HAD HAD THE MEDICAL SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT FROM THE BEGINNING AND WHO AFTERWARDS BECAME MR WILSON'S BROTHER-IN-LAW
HAWORTH JULY 18TH 1841
BELLIGERENT BY NATURE IT WAS WELL FOR THEIR PROFESSIONAL CHARACTER THAT THEY HAD AS CLERGYMEN SUFFICIENT SCOPE FOR THE EXERCISE OF THEIR WARLIKE PROPENSITIES
I AM A HEARTY HATER AND IF THERE IS ANY ONE I THOROUGHLY ABHOR IT IS THAT MAN
YOU MAY EMBODY IN IT YOUR BEST THOUGHTS AND YOUR WISEST FEELINGS AND IN SO DOING DISCIPLINE AND STRENGTHEN THEM
MISS BRANWELL URGED HER VIEWS UPON MR BRONTE AS SOON AS THE IMMEDIATE DANGER TO THE OLD SERVANT'S LIFE WAS OVER
SPRING A SONG
RIGHT BEFORE THE TRAVELLER ON THIS ROAD RISES HAWORTH VILLAGE
BY MISS BRONTE'S OWN DESIRE SHE GAVE HER ENGLISH LESSONS IN THE CLASSE OR SCHOOLROOM WITHOUT THE SUPERVISION OF MADAME OR M
I SEE PLAINLY IT IS PROVED TO US THAT THERE IS SCARCELY A DRAUGHT OF UNMINGLED HAPPINESS TO BE HAD IN THIS WORLD
TO QUOTE AGAIN FROM MARY'S LETTER WE THOUGHT HER VERY IGNORANT FOR SHE HAD NEVER LEARNT GRAMMAR AT ALL AND VERY LITTLE GEOGRAPHY THIS ACCOUNT OF HER PARTIAL IGNORANCE IS CONFIRMED BY HER OTHER SCHOOL FELLOWS
INDEED I SUSPECT THEY HAD SCARCELY RECOVERED
FOR IN SUCH AN HOUR AS YE THINK NOT THE SON OF MAN COMETH MATTHEW XXIV
HER INTELLECT AND ATTAINMENTS ARE OF THE VERY HIGHEST STANDARD AND THIS WAS THE FRIEND WHOM SHE WAS TO LOSE
JE VOUS LE DIS J'AI REFLECHI POUR VOUS
THEY WERE PAST THEIR FIRST YOUTH
TO LEAVE A CERTAINTY FOR A COMPLETE UNCERTAINTY WOULD BE TO THE LAST DEGREE IMPRUDENT
A BRIDE WAS EXPECTED TO MAKE HER FIRST APPEARANCE AND THE MINISTER TOLD THE SINGERS NOT TO PERFORM THE ANTHEM
FINDS HERSELF FREE AND ON THAT PATH TO ADVENTURE AND EXERTION TO WHICH SHE HAS SO LONG BEEN SEEKING ADMISSION
I REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN THE INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY CAME WITH MR PEEL'S SPEECH IN IT CONTAINING THE TERMS ON WHICH THE CATHOLICS WERE TO BE LET IN
HEGER GAVE ME BEFORE I LEFT BRUSSELS
NOBODY KNEW WHAT AILED HER BUT ME
SHE SAID SHE HAD TAKEN INTEREST IN POLITICS EVER SINCE SHE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
WHERE THEY HAD A DISTINCT PURPOSE TO BE ACHIEVED IN INTERCOURSE WITH THEIR FELLOWS THEY FORGOT THEMSELVES
HER DUTIES WERE NOT MERELY TO LEARN HER LESSONS TO READ A CERTAIN QUANTITY TO GAIN CERTAIN IDEAS
IT IS WHAT WOULD BE GENERALLY ESTEEMED VERY HANDSOME
THE ATTACHMENTS THE ANTIPATHIES AND THE HOSPITALITIES OF THE DISTRICT ARE ARDENT HEARTY AND HOMELY
THE ADVENTURES OF ERNEST ALEMBERT A TALE MAY 26TH 1830
MUCH AS SHE DISLIKED THE LIFE OF A PRIVATE GOVERNESS IT WAS HER DUTY TO RELIEVE HER FATHER OF THE BURDEN OF HER SUPPORT AND THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY OPEN TO HER
GREAT NUMBERS OF STRANGERS FLOCKED TO THE PLACE
WHEN DO YOU SET OFF
I AM AFRAID SIR YOU THINK ME VERY FOOLISH
AN OLD MAN APPEARED STANDING WITHOUT WHO ACCOSTED HER THUS OLD MAN_.--'DOES THE PARSON LIVE HERE TABBY_.--'YES OLD MAN_.--'I WISH TO SEE HIM TABBY_.--'HE IS POORLY IN BED OLD MAN_.--'I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR HIM TABBY_.--'WHO FROM OLD MAN_.--'FROM THE LORD TABBY_.--'WHO OLD MAN_.--'THE LORD
EMILY AND ANNE WERE BOUND UP IN THEIR LIVES AND INTERESTS LIKE TWINS
THE GROUNDS ARE FINE AND EXTENSIVE
AT ALL OTHER TIMES THEY WERE MISERABLY SHY
I WILL DO SO IN AS FEW WORDS AS I CAN
YOU PUZZLE ME
HEAR THAT FRIEND'S ACCOUNT OF THEIR FINAL INTERVIEW WHEN I LAST SAW CHARLOTTE JAN
BUT THE EDUCATION WHICH THE VILLAGE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTERS HAD RECEIVED DID NOT AS YET QUALIFY THEM TO UNDERTAKE THE CHARGE OF ADVANCED PUPILS
AND SHE NAMED HER RELIEF AND GLADNESS WHEN THE DOCTOR CONDEMNED THE MEAT AND SPOKE OF HAVING SEEN HIM SPIT IT OUT
IN PASSING THROUGH LONDON SHE SEEMED TO THINK OUR BUSINESS WAS AND OUGHT TO BE TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES AND STATUES WE COULD
NOW I AM GOING TO SIT DOWN AND ANSWER YOUR LETTER

SHE WAS TOO APT TO CONSIDER THAT ALLOWING HERSELF A HOLIDAY WAS A DERELICTION OF DUTY AND TO REFUSE HERSELF THE NECESSARY CHANGE FROM SOMETHING OF AN OVER-ASCETIC SPIRIT BETOKENING A LOSS OF HEALTHY BALANCE IN EITHER BODY OR MIND
ON A SCRAP OF PAPER SHE HAS WRITTEN DOWN THE FOLLOWING RELATION JUNE 22 1830 6 O'CLOCK P.M
YOU CAN TELL AS WELL AS ME THE LONELY FEELING OF BEING WITHOUT A COMPANION SOON AFTER THIS WAS WRITTEN MR AND MRS
ISABELLA-CLARA-EUGENIA HISPAN
FOR TILL SAD EXPERIENCE TAUGHT THEM BETTER THEY FELL INTO THE USUAL ERROR OF CONFOUNDING STRONG PASSIONS WITH STRONG CHARACTER
BE YE ALSO READY
THE FIRST AND SECOND CLASSES OCCUPIED A LONG ROOM DIVIDED BY A WOODEN PARTITION
HEGER'S ORDERS
4TH 1845
AND THEN STRIKING SPURS THEY DASHED QUICKLY DOWN TO THE TURNPIKE
WHEREVER I SEEK FOR HER NOW IN THIS WORLD SHE CANNOT BE FOUND NO MORE THAN A FLOWER OR A LEAF WHICH WITHERED TWENTY YEARS AGO
MY SISTER EMILY WAS NOT A PERSON OF DEMONSTRATIVE CHARACTER NOR ONE ON THE RECESSES OF WHOSE MIND AND FEELINGS EVEN THOSE NEAREST AND DEAREST TO HER COULD WITH IMPUNITY INTRUDE UNLICENSED
IF THE WISH SHOULD RISE I'LL LOOK AT SOUTHEY'S LETTER AND SUPPRESS IT
I NO LONGER REGARD MYSELF AS YOUNG--INDEED I SHALL SOON BE TWENTY-EIGHT
WEARY WITH A DAY'S HARD WORK I AM SITTING DOWN TO WRITE A FEW LINES TO MY DEAR E

BRONTE A.B
EMILY AND CHARLOTTE WALKED OUT ON THEM PERPETUALLY TO THE GREAT DAMAGE OF OUR SHOES BUT I HOPE TO THE BENEFIT OF OUR HEALTH THE OLD PLAN OF SCHOOL-KEEPING WAS OFTEN DISCUSSED IN THESE RAMBLES
THE BULK OF THE POPULATION WERE DISSENTERS PRINCIPALLY INDEPENDENTS
HE WOULD THINK I WAS A WILD ROMANTIC ENTHUSIAST INDEED
ALL ROUND THE LANDS HELD BY THE FARMER WHO LIVES IN THE REMAINS OF HOWLEY HALL ARE STONE HOUSES OF TO-DAY OCCUPIED BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THEIR LIVING AND THEIR FORTUNES BY THE WOOLLEN MILLS THAT ENCROACH UPON AND SHOULDER OUT THE PROPRIETORS OF THE ANCIENT HALLS
BUT NEITHER SHE NOR HER SISTERS WERE NATURALLY FOND OF CHILDREN
MISS BRONTE GIVES THE FOLLOWING REASONS AS THOSE WHICH PREVENTED EMILY'S REMAINING AT SCHOOL AND CAUSED THE SUBSTITUTION OF HER YOUNGER SISTER IN HER PLACE AT MISS W---'S MY SISTER EMILY LOVED THE MOORS
AND PERHAPS THERE IS NO PART OF ENGLAND WHERE THE TRADITIONAL AND FOND RECOLLECTIONS OF THE COMMONWEALTH HAVE LINGERED SO LONG AS IN THAT INHABITED BY THE WOOLLEN MANUFACTURING POPULATION OF THE WEST RIDING WHO HAD THE RESTRICTIONS TAKEN OFF THEIR TRADE BY THE PROTECTOR'S ADMIRABLE COMMERCIAL POLICY
THE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION COMPREHENDS HISTORY GEOGRAPHY THE USE OF THE GLOBES GRAMMAR WRITING AND ARITHMETIC ALL KINDS OF NEEDLEWORK AND THE NICER KINDS OF HOUSEHOLD WORK--SUCH AS GETTING UP FINE LINEN IRONING C
MARIA WAS DELICATE UNUSUALLY CLEVER AND THOUGHTFUL FOR HER AGE GENTLE AND UNTIDY
IT WAS A SEVERE TRIAL FOR ANY ONE AT HER TIME OF LIFE TO CHANGE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND HABITATION SO ENTIRELY AS SHE DID
THERE IS NO PAINTED WOOD TO REQUIRE CONTINUAL BEAUTIFYING OR ELSE PRESENT A SHABBY ASPECT
INDEPENDENCE OF THOUGHT AND ACTION WAS ENCOURAGED
A PROJECT NOT ACTUALLY COMMENCED IS ALWAYS UNCERTAIN
AND I WILL CONTINUE TO STAY D
NOT A WORD OF THAT PART OF JANE EYRE BUT IS A LITERAL REPETITION OF SCENES BETWEEN THE PUPIL AND THE TEACHER

AND GIRLS WHO WERE SCHOOL-FELLOWS WITH THE BRONTES DURING THE REIGN OF THE COOK OF WHOM I AM SPEAKING TELL ME THAT THE HOUSE SEEMED TO BE PERVADED MORNING NOON AND NIGHT BY THE ODOUR OF RANCID FAT THAT STEAMED OUT OF THE OVEN IN WHICH MUCH OF THEIR FOOD WAS PREPARED
I MUST--I WILL--I'M SET UPON IT--I'LL BE OBSTINATE AND BEAR DOWN ALL OPPOSITION
SOME TRAVELLER FOR A LONDON HOUSE OF BUSINESS CAME TO HAWORTH FOR A NIGHT
FAST ON HER HEELS FOLLOWED PATRICK BRANWELL EMILY JANE AND ANNE
EXECUTION BY BEHEADING WAS PERFORMED IN A SUMMARY WAY UPON EITHER MEN OR WOMEN WHO WERE GUILTY OF BUT VERY SLIGHT CRIMES
IT WAS SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE AN ANSWER CAME
AS TO THE MRS WHO YOU SAY IS LIKE ME I SOMEHOW FEEL NO LEANING TO HER AT ALL
A MAN RODE INTO THE CHURCH UPON AN ASS WITH HIS FACE TURNED TOWARDS THE TAIL AND AS MANY OLD HATS PILED ON HIS HEAD AS HE COULD POSSIBLY CARRY
THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF KEIGHLEY HAVE BEEN VERY GREATLY INCREASED DURING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OWING TO THE RAPIDLY EXTENDED MARKET FOR WORSTED MANUFACTURES A BRANCH OF INDUSTRY THAT MAINLY EMPLOYS THE FACTORY POPULATION OF THIS PART OF YORKSHIRE WHICH HAS BRADFORD FOR ITS CENTRE AND METROPOLIS
THE TWO ELDEST CHILDREN ALONE ARE UNDER HER CARE THE REST ARE CONFINED TO THE NURSERY WITH WHICH AND ITS OCCUPANTS SHE HAS NOTHING TO DO I HOPE SHE'LL DO
BUT THE LIKENESSES WERE I SHOULD THINK ADMIRABLE
THIS WAS JUST SUCH A TERROR AS ONLY HYPOCHONDRIACS CAN PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES
IL N'EUT PAS BESOIN COMME ULYSSE DE SE LIER AU MAT DU NAVIRE NI DE SE BOUCHER LES OREILLES AVEC DE LA CIRE
MR BRONTE HAD BEEN VERY SOLICITOUS TO GET THEM GOOD INSTRUCTION
I RECEIVED AN ANSWER FROM MR
L'UN CHERCHAIT LES APPLAU-DISSEMENTS L'AUTRE NE SE SOUCIE QUE DU TEMOIGNAGE DE SA CONSCIENCE
MR DRIVER LENDS US IT AS LIKEWISE BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE THE MOST ABLE PERIODICAL THERE IS
IF I WERE YOU I WOULD NOT BE TOO ANXIOUS TO SPEND MY TIME IN READING WHILST IN TOWN
WHEN THAT FAILED HER DEPRESSION RETURNED
I REACHED HOME A LITTLE AFTER TWO O'CLOCK ALL SAFE AND RIGHT YESTERDAY
THE SILVER CUP A TALE
AND IN DEFAULT OF GOOD ONES THEY WOULD TAKE AND ANALYSE ANY PRINT OR DRAWING WHICH CAME IN THEIR WAY AND FIND OUT HOW MUCH THOUGHT HAD GONE TO ITS COMPOSITION WHAT IDEAS IT WAS INTENDED TO SUGGEST AND WHAT IT DID SUGGEST
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD WONDER HOW WE WERE GETTING ON WHEN YOU HEARD OF THE RAILWAY PANIC
WE CAN ONLY TRUST IN SUCH CASES THAT THE EMPLOYERS ERR RATHER FROM A DENSITY OF PERCEPTION AND AN ABSENCE OF SYMPATHY THAN FROM ANY NATURAL CRUELTY OF DISPOSITION
AS FOR THE REST OF HER FEATURES THEY WERE PLAIN LARGE AND ILL SET
I STRIVE TO CONCEAL AND SUPPRESS THEM AS MUCH AS I CAN
I DO NOT WONDER AT THIS BUT I DO WONDER SHE SHOULD EVER MARRY A MAN TOWARDS WHOM HER FEELINGS MUST ALWAYS HAVE BEEN PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THEY ARE NOW
AND IN THIS MANNER HE DIED
THE GREY PILE OF BUILDING FORMERLY A HOUSE OF PROFESSED LADIES THE MOULDERING STONE IN THE DEPTH OF THE WOOD UNDER WHICH ROBIN HOOD IS SAID TO LIE
IT WILL PASS SO SLOWLY
JE VOUS AI DIT SOUVENT EN FRANCAIS COMBIEN JE VOUS RESPECTE COMBIEN JE SUIS REDEVABLE A VOTRE BONTE A VOS CONSEILS
I THINK I BEFORE INTIMATED THAT THE MESSRS
HER DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS WHEN SHE WAS NOT WELL WAS PITIFUL IN ITS EXTREMITY
BE THAT AS IT MAY THE LETTER AND THE VERSES BEAR THE SAME STAMP AND I CAN WELL UNDERSTAND THE STATE OF MIND THEY INDICATE
POUR SE FORMER UNE JUSTE IDEE DE L'INFLUENCE QU'EXERCA CET HOMME SUR LES CARACTERES CHOSES ET LES IDEES DE SON TEMPS IL FAUT SE LE REPRESENTER AU MILIEU DE L'ARMEE DES CROISEES DANS SON DOUBLE ROLE DE PROPHETE ET DE GUERRIER
BESIDES WE DO NOT DESPAIR OF TABBY'S RETURN AND SHE SHALL NOT BE SUPPLANTED BY A STRANGER IN HER ABSENCE
ABOUT CHARLOTTE THERE WAS MUCH DELIBERATION AND SOME DISCUSSION
SPEAKING OF HER DEAD SISTER THE FORMER TOLD ME THAT FROM HER MANY TRAITS IN SHIRLEY'S CHARACTER WERE TAKEN
TALES DRAMAS POEMS ROMANCES WRITTEN PRINCIPALLY BY CHARLOTTE IN A HAND WHICH IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DECIPHER WITHOUT THE AID OF A MAGNIFYING GLASS
AT OTHERS SHE SEEMED AFRAID OF LETTING HER THOUGHTS DWELL ON THE SUBJECT SAYING IT BROUGHT ON THE WORST PALSY OF ALL
I SHOULD LIKE UNCOMMONLY TO BE IN THE DINING-ROOM AT HOME OR IN THE KITCHEN OR IN THE BACK KITCHEN
AMONG THE LETTERS THAT I HAVE READ THERE IS ONE WHOSE EVIDENCE OUGHT TO BE HIGHLY RESPECTED
IT WAS TO CULTIVATE HER TASTES
BUT THE COOK WHO HAD MUCH OF HIS CONFIDENCE AND AGAINST WHOM FOR A LONG TIME NO ONE DURST UTTER A COMPLAINT WAS CARELESS DIRTY AND WASTEFUL
AND WHEN THE PAPER CAME WHICH WAS TO DECIDE THE QUESTION THE ANXIETY WAS ALMOST DREADFUL WITH WHICH WE LISTENED TO THE WHOLE AFFAIR
BUT FREQUENTLY CHILDREN ARE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE EFFECT WHICH SOME OF THEIR SIMPLE REVELATIONS WOULD HAVE IN ALTERING THE OPINIONS ENTERTAINED BY THEIR FRIENDS OF THE PERSONS PLACED AROUND THEM
IF NOT DON'T SAY A WORD ON THE SUBJECT
WITH A STERNNESS OF MANNER AND A HARSHNESS OF LANGUAGE SCARCELY CREDIBLE
AT ONE TIME CHARLOTTE HAD THE NOTION OF MAKING HER LIVING AS AN ARTIST AND WEARIED HER EYES IN DRAWING WITH PRE-RAPHAELITE MINUTENESS BUT NOT WITH PRE-RAPHAELITE ACCURACY FOR SHE DREW FROM FANCY RATHER THAN FROM NATURE
IN THE FIRST PLACE INSTEAD OF DISCUSSING THE PLOT OR STORY SHE ANALYSES THE CHARACTER OF VARNEY
I HOPED TO BE ABLE TO ASK YOU TO COME TO HAWORTH
I NEVER SAW THE LIKE IN ANY OTHER HUMAN CREATURE
THE REPLY WAS YO'D BETTER NOT
I NEVER WAS EXACTLY CARELESS OF THESE MATTERS BUT I HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN A CLOUDED AND REPULSIVE VIEW OF THEM
THOUGH SHE PATIENTLY TOLERATED ADVICE SHE COULD ALWAYS QUIETLY PUT IT ASIDE AND DO AS SHE THOUGHT FIT
THE USUAL EXPRESSION WAS OF QUIET LISTENING INTELLIGENCE
MY FATHER IS A CLERGYMAN OF LIMITED THOUGH COMPETENT INCOME AND I AM THE ELDEST OF HIS CHILDREN
HIS ELDER BROTHER A LAD OF EIGHT OR NINE AND NOT A PUPIL OF MISS BRONTE'S TEMPTED THE LITTLE FELLOW INTO THE FORBIDDEN PLACE
MONSIEUR UN EVENEMENT BIEN TRISTE DECIDE MESDEMOISELLES VAS FILLES A RETOURNER BRUSQUEMENT EN ANGLETERRE CE DEPART QUI NOUS AFFLIGE BEAUCOUP A CEPENDANT MA COMPLETE APPROBATION
I AM EXCEEDINGLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU STILL KEEP TABBY CONSIDERABLY UPWARDS OF SEVENTY IT IS AN ACT OF GREAT CHARITY TO HER AND I DO NOT THINK IT WILL BE UNREWARDED FOR SHE IS VERY FAITHFUL AND WILL ALWAYS SERVE YOU WHEN SHE HAS OCCASION TO THE BEST OF HER ABILITIES
AND THEN WHEN IT WAS ALL OUT HOW AUNT SAID THAT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT AND THAT THE CATHOLICS COULD DO NO HARM WITH SUCH GOOD SECURITY
BUT THEIR DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE MUST HAVE BEEN EXCITED IN MANY DIRECTIONS FOR I FIND A LIST OF PAINTERS WHOSE WORKS I WISH TO SEE DRAWN UP BY CHARLOTTE WHEN SHE WAS SCARCELY THIRTEEN GUIDO RENI JULIO ROMANO TITIAN RAPHAEL MICHAEL ANGELO CORREGGIO ANNIBAL CARACCI LEONARDO DA VINCI FRA BARTOLOMEO CARLO CIGNANI VANDYKE RUBENS BARTOLOMEO RAMERGHI HERE IS THIS LITTLE GIRL IN A REMOTE YORKSHIRE PARSONAGE WHO HAS PROBABLY NEVER SEEN ANYTHING WORTHY THE NAME OF A PAINTING IN HER LIFE STUDYING THE NAMES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREAT OLD ITALIAN AND FLEMISH MASTERS WHOSE WORKS SHE LONGS TO SEE SOME TIME IN THE DIM FUTURE THAT LIES BEFORE HER
MAIS NAPOLEON EMPEREUR C'EST AUTRE CHOSE JE L'EXTIRPERAI DU SOL DE L'EUROPE ET CELUI QUI PARLA AINSI TOUJOURS SUT GARDER SA PROMESSE CELLE-LA COMME TOUTES LES AUTRES
BUT BEFORE THE NEXT WINTER IT WAS THOUGHT DESIRABLE TO ADVISE THEIR REMOVAL AS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE DAMP SITUATION OF THE HOUSE AT COWAN BRIDGE DID NOT SUIT THEIR HEALTH
HER WALKS TOO WERE SOLITARY AND PRINCIPALLY TAKEN IN THE ALLEE DEFENDUE WHERE SHE WAS SECURE FROM INTRUSION
STILL IF THEY HAD BEHAVED QUIETLY AND DECENTLY I WOULD HAVE SERVED THEM OUT THEIR TEA IN PEACE
COMME TREMPE DE CARACTERE COMME DROITURE COMME ELEVATION DE PENSEE ET DE BUT IL EST D'UNE TOUT AUTRE ESPECE
THE MINISTER AT LAST LEFT THE PLACE AND ALONG WITH HIM WENT MANY OF THE MOST TEMPERATE AND RESPECTABLE PART OF THE CONGREGATION AND THE SINGERS REMAINED TRIUMPHANT
I REMEMBER MISS BRONTE ONCE TELLING ME THAT IT WAS A SAYING ROUND ABOUT HAWORTH KEEP A STONE IN THY POCKET SEVEN YEAR
SHE SAID THAT NONE BUT THOSE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE POSITION OF A GOVERNESS COULD EVER REALISE THE DARK SIDE OF RESPECTABLE HUMAN NATURE
PRESSED ON HIS LOVE FOR HIS DAUGHTERS
I SAY EMILY INSTEAD OF ANNE
AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR HIS DELAY IN REPLYING TO HERS BY THE FACT OF A LONG ABSENCE FROM HOME DURING WHICH HIS LETTERS HAD ACCUMULATED WHENCE IT HAS LAIN UNANSWERED TILL THE LAST OF A NUMEROUS FILE NOT FROM DISRESPECT OR INDIFFERENCE TO ITS CONTENTS BUT BECAUSE IN TRUTH IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK TO ANSWER IT NOR A PLEASANT ONE TO CAST A DAMP OVER THE HIGH SPIRITS AND THE GENEROUS DESIRES OF YOUTH HE GOES ON TO SAY
YOU ARE NOT FOND OF MAKING SHABBY PURCHASES
THE WAY IN WHICH MR BRONTE MADE HIS CHILDREN SYMPATHISE WITH HIM IN HIS GREAT INTEREST IN POLITICS MUST HAVE DONE MUCH TO LIFT THEM ABOVE THE CHANCES OF THEIR MINDS BEING LIMITED OR TAINTED BY PETTY LOCAL GOSSIP
AND THOUGH SHE WAS NOT GIVEN TO OPEN EXPRESSION OF HER THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS YET HER INCREASING COOLNESS OF BEHAVIOUR SHOWED HOW MUCH HER MOST CHERISHED OPINIONS HAD BEEN WOUNDED
AND THE PROGRESS OF THE POEMS WAS NOT UNREASONABLY LENGTHY OR LONG DRAWN OUT
AND INSTEAD OF BEING SORRY THAT THIS WISH OF MANY YEARS COULD NOT BE REALISED SHE HAD REASON TO BE GLAD
ANOTHER NOTICEABLE FACT IS THE INTELLIGENT PARTISANSHIP WITH WHICH THEY CHOOSE THEIR GREAT MEN WHO ARE ALMOST ALL STANCH TORIES OF THE TIME
FROM THENCE I SHOULD GUESS HIS FAMILY AUGURED TRULY THAT IF BRANWELL HAD BUT THE OPPORTUNITY AND ALAS
FAR FAR MORE THAN I EVER HAD
FOR BRANWELL'S TALENTS WERE READILY AND WILLINGLY BROUGHT OUT FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF OTHERS
C'EST APRES L'ANALYSE DE CE MORCEAU CONSIDERE SURTOUT DU POINT DE VUE DU FOND DE LA DISPOSITION DE CE QU'ON POURRAIT APPELER LA CHARPENTE QU'ONT ETE FAITS LES DEUX PORTRAITS QUE JE VOUS DONNE HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE HAD POINTED OUT TO THEM THE FAULT IN VICTOR HUGO'S STYLE AS BEING EXAGGERATION IN CONCEPTION AND AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD MADE THEM NOTICE THE EXTREME BEAUTY OF HIS NUANCES OF EXPRESSION
I HAVE DELAYED WRITING BECAUSE I HAVE NO GOOD NEWS TO COMMUNICATE
OR FROM HER AUNT MISS BRANWELL WHO CAME TO THE PARSONAGE WHEN CHARLOTTE WAS ONLY SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER DEAD SISTER'S FAMILY
WHY THEN SHOULD I INTRUDE MINE
FOR THOUGH I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN DISADVANTAGES IN MY PRESENT POSITION WHAT POSITION ON EARTH IS WITHOUT THEM
I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT NOT THIRTY YEARS AGO THE PHRASE IN OLIVER'S DAYS WAS IN COMMON USE TO DENOTE A TIME OF UNUSUAL PROSPERITY
I WONDER WHO WITH HIS ADVANTAGES WOULD BE WITHOUT HIS FAULTS
BY ANOTHER THE NEIGHBOURING CLERGY WHO REMEMBER HIM RIDING IN HIS OLD AGE DOWN THE HILL ON WHICH HIS HOUSE STOOD UPON HIS STRONG WHITE HORSE--HIS BEARING PROUD AND DIGNIFIED HIS SHOVEL HAT BENT OVER AND SHADOWING HIS KEEN EAGLE EYES--GOING TO HIS SUNDAY DUTY LIKE A FAITHFUL SOLDIER THAT DIES IN HARNESS--WHO CAN APPRECIATE HIS LOYALTY TO CONSCIENCE HIS SACRIFICES TO DUTY AND HIS STAND BY HIS RELIGION--HIS MEMORY IS VENERATED
NOT A CREATURE NOT AN OBSTACLE WAS IN THE WAY
HEGER'S ACCOUNT IS THAT THEY KNEW NOTHING OF FRENCH
NOR ON THE WHOLE WAS IT WANTING IN VARIETY
WHEN THEY HAD MADE FURTHER PROGRESS M
FOR AT THE TIME WHICH MY INFORMANT SPEAKS OF MRS BRONTE WAS CONFINED TO THE BEDROOM FROM WHICH SHE NEVER CAME FORTH ALIVE
WHEN HE WAS CONFINED TO HIS CHAMBER WITH WHAT HE KNEW WOULD BE HIS LAST ILLNESS HE HAD HIS COCKS BROUGHT UP THERE AND WATCHED THE BLOODY BATTLE FROM HIS BED
I COULD NOT BUT BE A PARTIAL JUDGE YET I THOUGHT THAT THESE VERSES TOO HAD A SWEET SINCERE PATHOS OF THEIR OWN
I GATHER FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD THAT BRANWELL MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE PLAN FELL THROUGH
WE TAKE THE LEEDS INTELLIGENCER TORY AND THE LEEDS MERCURY WHIG EDITED BY MR BAINES AND HIS BROTHER SON-IN-LAW AND HIS TWO SONS EDWARD AND TALBOT
SHE DID BUT LITTLE PLAIN-SEWING
AND IN THE DELINEATION OF HIS DARK AND PROFOUNDLY ARTFUL MIND SCOTT EXHIBITS A WONDERFUL KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE AS WELL AS A SURPRISING SKILL IN EMBODYING HIS PERCEPTIONS SO AS TO ENABLE OTHERS TO BECOME PARTICIPATORS IN THAT KNOWLEDGE COMMONPLACE AS THIS EXTRACT MAY SEEM IT IS NOTEWORTHY ON TWO OR THREE ACCOUNTS
IT IS TRADITIONALLY SAID THAT A COLONY OF FLEMINGS CAME OVER AND SETTLED IN THE WEST RIDING TO TEACH THE INHABITANTS WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR WOOL
I HAVE NAMED THESE INSTANCES OF ECCENTRICITY IN THE FATHER BECAUSE I HOLD THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEM TO BE NECESSARY FOR A RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIFE OF HIS DAUGHTER
BY THE WAY I HAVE LATELY DISCOVERED I HAVE QUITE A TALENT FOR CLEANING SWEEPING UP HEARTHS DUSTING ROOMS MAKING BEDS C
THORNTON CHURCH IS A LITTLE EPISCOPAL CHAPEL OF EASE RICH IN NONCONFORMIST MONUMENTS AS OF ACCEPTED LISTER AND HIS FRIEND DR HALL
HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH HIS SITUATION
THOUGH AS I WAS NOT CERTAIN THAT THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL REASON FOR SUCH A DISLIKE AND THOUGHT IT ABSURD TO TRUST TO MERE INSTINCT I BOTH CONCEALED AND REPRESSED THE FEELING AS MUCH AS I COULD
IF YOU WERE NEAR ME PERHAPS I MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO TELL YOU ALL TO GROW EGOTISTICAL AND POUR OUT THE LONG HISTORY OF A PRIVATE GOVERNESS'S TRIALS AND CROSSES IN HER FIRST SITUATION
AND WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT TO HIMSELF HE SEEMED IN A GREAT RAPTURE AND THE FIRST WORDS HE UTTERED WERE I HAVE HAD A GLORIOUS VISION FROM THE THIRD HEAVEN HE DID NOT SAY WHAT HE HAD SEEN BUT RETURNED INTO THE CHURCH AND BEGAN THE SERVICE AGAIN AT TWO IN THE AFTERNOON AND WENT ON UNTIL SEVEN

BRONTE AUGUST 3 1830 AS EACH VOLUME CONTAINS FROM SIXTY TO A HUNDRED PAGES AND THE SIZE OF THE PAGE LITHOGRAPHED IS RATHER LESS THAN THE AVERAGE THE AMOUNT OF THE WHOLE SEEMS VERY GREAT IF WE REMEMBER THAT IT WAS ALL WRITTEN IN ABOUT FIFTEEN MONTHS
THE AIR IS DIM AND LIGHTLESS WITH THE SMOKE FROM ALL THESE HABITATIONS AND PLACES OF BUSINESS
HER IDEA OF SELF-IMPROVEMENT RULED HER EVEN AT SCHOOL
BUT ON THE THIRD SUNDAY THEY MUST HAVE BEEN GREATLY IRRITATED AT SEEING MR REDHEAD DETERMINED TO BRAVE THEIR WILL RIDE UP THE VILLAGE STREET ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL GENTLEMEN FROM BRADFORD
BUT THE WANT OF FAITH IN STRANGERS AND UNTRIED MODES OF ACTION EXTENDS ITSELF EVEN TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE VIRTUES ARE REGARDED
I HAVE WRITTEN TO ALL THE FRIENDS ON WHOM I HAVE THE SLIGHTEST CLAIM AND TO SOME ON WHOM I HAVE NO CLAIM
MAKE USE OF YOUR OWN EYES FOR THE PURPOSES OF OBSERVATION NOW AND FOR A TIME AT LEAST LAY ASIDE THE SPECTACLES WITH WHICH AUTHORS WOULD FURNISH US IN A POSTSCRIPT SHE ADDS WILL YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO INFORM ME OF THE NUMBER OF PERFORMERS IN THE KING'S MILITARY BAND AND IN SOMETHING OF THE SAME STRAIN SHE WRITES ON JUNE 19TH
SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MAN--A GREAT NAVIGATOR SAID M
SUPPOSE WE HAD EACH AN ISLAND OF OUR OWN BRANWELL
AND THE DUKE PAR EXCELLENCE THE DUKE AND SIR ROBERT PEEL SHOW NO SIGNS OF INSECURITY THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN TWICE BEAT
WITH INWARD REMORSE AND SHAME SHE LOOKED BACK ON HER FORMER FAILURE AND RESOLVED TO CONQUER BUT THE VICTORY COST HER DEAR
I TRUST IT IS PARTLY DERIVED FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT MY FRIEND'S CHARACTER IS OF A HIGHER A MORE STEADFAST ORDER THAN I WAS ONCE PERFECTLY AWARE OF
HE DID NOT SNIGGLE
THE TERMS WERE 50_L
J'ECRIRAIS UN LIVRE ET JE LE DEDIERAIS A MON MAITRE DE LITTERATURE AU SEUL MAITRE QUE J'AIE JAMAIS EU--A VOUS MONSIEUR
THE INHABITANTS REFER INQUIRERS CONCERNING THE DATE TO THE FOLLOWING INSCRIPTION ON A STONE IN THE CHURCH TOWER HIC FECIT CAENOBIUM MONACHORUM AUTESTE FUNDATOR
TO COUNTERBALANCE THIS TENDENCY IN CHARLOTTE WAS THE STRONG COMMON SENSE NATURAL TO HER AND DAILY CALLED INTO EXERCISE BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF HER PRACTICAL LIFE
WHILE MR SHEPHEARD THE SON-IN-LAW STATES IT TO HAVE BEEN ONLY SIXTEEN
ET QUAND LA FOULE HONTEUSE DE SA REBELLION VENAIT LECHER LES PIEDS DU MAITRE LE HAUTAIN PATRICIEN MEPRISAIT L'HOMMAGE D'AUJOURD'HUI COMME LA HAINE D'HIER ET DANS LES RUES DE LONDRES ET DEVANT SON PALAIS DUCAL D'APSLEY IL REPOUSSAIT D'UN GENRE PLEIN DE FROID DEDAIN L'INCOMMODE EMPRESSEMENT DU PEUPLE ENTHOUSIASTE
THE QUIET REGULARITY OF HIS DOMESTIC HOURS WAS ONLY BROKEN IN UPON BY CHURCH-WARDENS AND VISITORS ON PAROCHIAL BUSINESS
SUNDAY BAKING-DAY AND SATURDAY ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE ANY DISTINCTIVE MARK
I HAVE FEWER ILLUSIONS
23
PARLIAMENT WAS OPENED AND THE GREAT CATHOLIC QUESTION WAS BROUGHT FORWARD AND THE DUKE'S MEASURES WERE DISCLOSED AND ALL WAS SLANDER VIOLENCE PARTY-SPIRIT AND CONFUSION
TO BID GOOD-BYE TO HER DEAR FRIEND MARY WHO WAS LEAVING ENGLAND FOR AUSTRALIA
THE FIRST IS THE INITIALS WITH WHICH SHE HAD EVIDENTLY SIGNED THE FORMER ONE TO WHICH SHE ALLUDES
DID YOU NOT FEEL AWED WHILE GAZING AT ST PAUL'S AND WESTMINSTER ABBEY
WHAT I SEND YOU IS THE PREFATORY SCENE OF A MUCH LONGER SUBJECT IN WHICH I HAVE STRIVEN TO DEVELOP STRONG PASSIONS AND WEAK PRINCIPLES STRUGGLING WITH A HIGH IMAGINATION AND ACUTE FEELINGS TILL AS YOUTH HARDENS TOWARDS AGE EVIL DEEDS AND SHORT ENJOYMENTS END IN MENTAL MISERY AND BODILY RUIN
BUT THERE IS A DANGER OF WHICH I WOULD WITH ALL KINDNESS AND ALL EARNESTNESS WARN YOU
IN AFTER-LIFE I WAS PAINFULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE FACT THAT MISS BRONTE NEVER DARED TO ALLOW HERSELF TO LOOK FORWARD WITH HOPE
THEN TOO THERE ARE JUDICIOUS RELATIONS ALWAYS ROUND YOU WHO CAN MUCH BETTER DISCHARGE THAT UNPLEASANT OFFICE
DECEMBER 21ST 1839 WE ARE AT PRESENT AND HAVE BEEN DURING THE LAST MONTH RATHER BUSY AS FOR THAT SPACE OF TIME WE HAVE BEEN WITHOUT A SERVANT EXCEPT A LITTLE GIRL TO RUN ERRANDS
AS SHE IS NEAR WE SEE HER VERY OFTEN
THIS KIND OF EXERCISE DELIGHTED CHARLOTTE
OLD AND INFIRM PEOPLE HAVE BUT FEW SOURCES OF HAPPINESS--FEWER ALMOST THAN THE COMPARATIVELY YOUNG AND HEALTHY CAN CONCEIVE
THE ELDERS OF THE HOUSE HAVE NEVER CORDIALLY ACQUIESCED IN THE MEASURE
HE IN HIS TURN WAS MOURNED OVER BY THE SURVIVING SISTER
THE ONE THAT RESIGNED AND THE ONE THAT SUCCEEDED AND PASSED THE REFORM BILL
THE NEXT DAY IN FULL FAMILY CONCLAVE THE MOTHER ASKED MISS BRONTE WHAT OCCASIONED THE MARK ON HER FOREHEAD
I WISH THEY HAD TESTIFIED THEIR REGARD BY A LESS EXPENSIVE TOKEN
I BELIEVE THAT NO MOVEMENT WAS MADE IN THE CHURCH ON EITHER SUNDAY UNTIL THE WHOLE OF THE AUTHORISED READING SERVICE WAS GONE THROUGH AND I AM SURE THAT NOTHING WAS MORE REMOTE FROM THE MORE RESPECTABLE PARTY THAN ANY PERSONAL ANTAGONISM TOWARD MR REDHEAD
SHE HAD BESIDES TO BRUSH ROOMS TO RUN ERRANDS UP AND DOWN STAIRS TO HELP IN THE SIMPLER FORMS OF COOKING TO BE BY TURNS PLAY-FELLOW AND MONITRESS TO HER YOUNGER SISTERS AND BROTHER TO MAKE AND TO MEND AND TO STUDY ECONOMY UNDER HER CAREFUL AUNT
THIS HENRY BATT POSSESSED HIMSELF OF HOUSES AND MONEY WITHOUT SCRUPLE
AND HER ESTIMATION OF THEIR RELATIVE POWERS WAS THE SAME
I SHOULD THINK MARY AND MARTHA HAVE NOT MORE THAN SUFFICIENT POCKET-MONEY TO SUPPLY THEMSELVES
BUT IT INVOLVED SOME OUTLAY
NO ONE WROTE IN IT AND NO ONE READ IT BUT HERSELF HER BROTHER AND TWO SISTERS
THE BULL WAS FASTENED BY A CHAIN OR ROPE TO A POST IN THE RIVER
THE FIRST SUNDAY HE OFFICIATED HAWORTH CHURCH WAS FILLED EVEN TO THE AISLES
4TH VOL.:--1
BUT I RECOLLECT SOME SCRUBBY OLD FABLE ABOUT GRASSHOPPERS AND ANTS BY A SCRUBBY OLD KNAVE YCLEPT AESOP
I GRIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE SO INCONVENIENCED YOU
IN EACH DIVISION WERE FOUR LONG RANGES OF DESKS
I SAW HER FOR AN INSTANT FLASHING THROUGH THE RUE ROYALE IN A CARRIAGE AND SIX SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS
IT WILL PERHAPS BE NECESSARY THAT YOU SHOULD SEE THE MANUSCRIPT IN ORDER TO CALCULATE ACCURATELY THE EXPENSE OF PUBLICATION
AND SUCH WOULD ASSUREDLY BE OUR CASE AS IN THE LITTLE WILD MOORLAND VILLAGE WHERE WE RESIDE THERE WOULD BE NO POSSIBILITY OF BORROWING A WORK OF THAT DESCRIPTION FROM A CIRCULATING LIBRARY
THIS PLACE IS FAR BETTER THAN BUT GOD KNOWS I HAVE ENOUGH TO DO TO KEEP A GOOD HEART IN THE MATTER
I FEEL IT MOST ON HOLIDAYS WHEN ALL THE GIRLS AND TEACHERS GO OUT TO VISIT AND IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT I AM LEFT DURING SEVERAL HOURS QUITE ALONE WITH FOUR GREAT DESOLATE SCHOOLROOMS AT MY DISPOSITION
I WANT US ALL TO GET ON
BEFORE I CAN VENTURE TO PRONOUNCE ON A CHARACTER I MUST SEE IT FIRST UNDER VARIOUS LIGHTS AND FROM VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW
DEBATES IN PARLIAMENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL
AND SO SATISFIED WAS THE GRANDMOTHER WITH THE KIND OF INSTRUCTION GIVEN THAT SHE NAMED THE ESTABLISHMENT WITH HIGH ENCOMIUMS TO MRS JERKINS
I HAVE SOME QUALITIES THAT MAKE ME VERY MISERABLE SOME FEELINGS THAT YOU CAN HAVE NO PARTICIPATION IN--THAT FEW VERY FEW PEOPLE IN THE WORLD CAN AT ALL UNDERSTAND
BELL WHICH IS TO THE FOLLOWING EFFECT THAT THEY ARE PREPARING FOR THE PRESS A WORK OF FICTION CONSISTING OF THREE DISTINCT AND UNCONNECTED TALES WHICH MAY BE PUBLISHED EITHER TOGETHER AS A WORK OF THREE VOLUMES OF THE ORDINARY NOVEL SIZE OR SEPARATELY AS SINGLE VOLUMES AS MAY BE DEEMED MOST ADVISABLE
MISS W MUST HAVE HAD IN GREAT PERFECTION THE FRENCH ART CONTER TO JUDGE FROM HER PUPIL'S RECOLLECTIONS OF THE TALES SHE RELATED DURING THESE LONG WALKS OF THIS OLD HOUSE OR THAT NEW MILL AND OF THE STATES OF SOCIETY CONSEQUENT ON THE CHANGES INVOLVED BY THE SUGGESTIVE DATES OF EITHER BUILDING
BUT IN THIS YEAR OF 1835 ALL HIS HOME KINDRED WERE THINKING HOW THEY COULD BEST FORWARD HIS VIEWS AND HOW HELP HIM UP TO THE PINNACLE WHERE HE DESIRED TO BE
BUT A SENSE OF SOMETHING WRONG CONNECTED WITH HIM SICKENED AND OPPRESSED THEM
I HAVE OFTEN YOU KNOW SAID HOW MUCH I WISHED SUCH A THING
I TALK OF A PLAIN AND EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE THOUGH IN DELPHIC STYLE I WRAP UP THE INFORMATION IN FIGURES OF SPEECH CONCERNING EGGS CHICKENS ETCEATERA ETCAETERORUM
A KNOWLEDGE OF GERMAN NOW BECAME HER OBJECT
IT IS TRUE
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT SWELLED TO MY THROAT AS I READ HER LETTER
SHE NEEDED HER BEST SPIRITS TO SAY WHAT WAS IN HER HEART FOR AT OTHER TIMES SHE HAD NOT COURAGE
IN THE FIRST WERE FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PUPILS
HE CALLS ELLIS A FINE QUAINT SPIRIT AND SPEAKS OF AN EVIDENT POWER OF WING THAT MAY REACH HEIGHTS NOT HERE ATTEMPTED AGAIN WITH SOME DEGREE OF PENETRATION THE REVIEWER SAYS THAT THE POEMS OF ELLIS CONVEY AN IMPRESSION OF ORIGINALITY BEYOND WHAT HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE VOLUMES EMBODY CURRER IS PLACED MIDWAY BETWEEN ELLIS AND ACTON
MISCELLANEOUS POEMS FINISHED MAY 30TH 1830
THIS WAS HER NOTION OF LITERARY FAME,--A PASSPORT TO THE SOCIETY OF CLEVER PEOPLE WHEN SHE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE PEOPLE AND WAYS AT BRUSSELS HER LIFE BECAME MONOTONOUS AND SHE FELL INTO THE SAME HOPELESS STATE AS AT MISS W---'S THOUGH IN A LESS DEGREE
HOW KIND AND AFFECTIONATE THAT WAS
ACCORDING TO THIS MODE OF ACTING WHEN SHE WAS INVITED FOR A MONTH SHE STAYED BUT A FORTNIGHT AMIDST E.'S FAMILY TO WHOM EVERY VISIT ONLY ENDEARED HER THE MORE AND BY WHOM SHE WAS RECEIVED WITH THAT KIND OF QUIET GLADNESS WITH WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE GREETED A SISTER
HE IS A PRETTY-LOOKING AND PRETTY BEHAVED YOUNG MAN APPARENTLY CONSTRUCTED WITHOUT A BACKBONE
22
ESPECIALLY THE FIRST
CONSEQUENTLY TEACHING VERY YOUNG CHILDREN WAS ANYTHING BUT A DELIGHTFUL TASK TO THE THREE BRONTE SISTERS
THE GRASSHOPPERS SANG ALL THE SUMMER AND STARVED ALL THE WINTER
SUCH ARE THE CONTRASTS OF MODES OF LIVING AND OF TIMES AND SEASONS BROUGHT BEFORE THE TRAVELLER ON THE GREAT ROADS THAT TRAVERSE THE WEST RIDING
AND AFTER THAT SUCCEEDED THE LECTURE PIEUSE_--CHARLOTTE'S NIGHTMARE
EMILY WALTER SCOTT MR LOCKHART JOHNNY LOCKHART
MY ADVICE TO ALL PROTESTANTS WHO ARE TEMPTED TO DO ANYTHING SO BESOTTED AS TURN CATHOLICS IS TO WALK OVER THE SEA ON TO THE CONTINENT
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THAT HOUSE CLEANLINESS GOES UP INTO ITS ESSENCE PURITY
CAME HERE THE OTHER DAY WITH A MOST MELANCHOLY TALE OF HER WRETCHED HUSBAND'S DRUNKEN EXTRAVAGANT PROFLIGATE HABITS
AND A MOST EFFICIENT NURSE SHE PROVED
BUT I HAVE A STEADY REGARD FOR YOU AND IF YOU WILL LET THE CLOUD AND SHOWER PASS BY BE SURE THE SUN IS ALWAYS BEHIND OBSCURED BUT STILL EXISTING AT CHRISTMAS SHE LEFT HER SITUATION AFTER A PARTING WITH HER EMPLOYERS WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE AFFECTED AND TOUCHED HER GREATLY
THIS IS A LARGE SCHOOL IN WHICH THERE ARE ABOUT FORTY EXTERNES OR DAY PUPILS AND TWELVE PENSIONNAIRES OR BOARDERS
SHOULD THE POEMS BE REMARKED UPON FAVOURABLY IT IS MY INTENTION TO APPROPRIATE A FURTHER SUM FOR ADVERTISEMENTS
BUT CHERISHING AND VALUING PRIVACY THEMSELVES THEY WERE PERHAPS OVER-DELICATE IN NOT INTRUDING UPON THE PRIVACY OF OTHERS
THIS SELECTION M
UPSTAIRS WERE FOUR BED CHAMBERS OF SIMILAR SIZE WITH THE ADDITION OF A SMALL APARTMENT OVER THE PASSAGE OR LOBBY AS WE CALL IT IN THE NORTH
AND MANY YEARS LATER MISS BRONTE TOLD ME THAT SHE FOUND IT SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AS TABBY EXPECTED TO BE INFORMED OF ALL THE FAMILY CONCERNS AND YET HAD GROWN SO DEAF THAT WHAT WAS REPEATED TO HER BECAME KNOWN TO WHOEVER MIGHT BE IN OR ABOUT THE HOUSE
I COULD NOT HELP IT
AND THE GRAVEYARD RISES ABOVE THE CHURCH AND IS TERRIBLY FULL OF UPRIGHT TOMBSTONES
VOILA DONC PIERRE DEVENU MOINE MAIS PIERRE IL AVAIT EN LUI UN PRINCIPE QUI L'EMPECHAIT DE RESTER LONG-TEMPS INACTIF SES IDEES SUR QUEL SUJET QU'IL SOIT QUE CE FUT NE POUVAIENT PAS ETRE BORNEES
PLUS DE MERE NI DE FRERE NI DE SOEUR NI DE FEMME NI D'ENFANT
DELIVERED FROM HAWORTH PULPIT LAST SUNDAY EVENING I NEVER HEARD
YOU ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE FROM ALL THIS THAT MR W
AND THOUGH THEY MIGHT NOW AND THEN BE ANNOYED BY PETTY TYRANNY SHE STILL INSPIRED THEM WITH SINCERE RESPECT AND NOT A LITTLE AFFECTION
AT THIS TIME THEY TALKED OVER PAST CARES AND TROUBLES
THEIR EXTERNAL MORALITY IS MORE RIGID THAN OURS
SO CHARLOTTE HAD QUIETLY TO TAKE UP HER BURDEN OF TEACHING AGAIN AND RETURN TO HER PREVIOUS MONOTONOUS LIFE
AND HAD THE REPUTATION IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF BEING A VERY HANDSOME FELLOW FULL OF IRISH ENTHUSIASM AND WITH SOMETHING OF AN IRISHMAN'S CAPABILITY OF FALLING EASILY IN LOVE
THE LIVERPOOL JOURNEY IS YET A MATTER OF TALK A SORT OF CASTLE IN THE AIR
VERILY IT IS A DELIGHTFUL THING TO LIVE HERE AT HOME AT FULL LIBERTY TO DO JUST WHAT ONE PLEASES
THOSE WHO HAD BEEN PUPILS AT THE SAME TIME KNEW WHO MUST HAVE WRITTEN THE BOOK FROM THE FORCE WITH WHICH HELEN BURNS SUFFERINGS ARE DESCRIBED
TALES OF THE ISLANDERS IN FOUR VOLUMES
MY DEAR I WOULD HARDLY MAKE THAT CONFESSION TO ANY ONE BUT YOURSELF
GOOD MR GRIMSHAW WESLEY'S FRIEND HAD BUILT A HUMBLE METHODIST CHAPEL BUT IT STOOD CLOSE TO THE ROAD LEADING ON TO THE MOOR
NO EAGLE IS EVER SEEN ON THOSE MOUNTAIN SLOPES NOW
MARY HAS BEEN INDEFATIGABLY KIND IN PROVIDING ME WITH INFORMATION
I DID SO LIKE THEM TO COME WHEN I HAD ANYTHING FOR THEM
ALL NOVELS AFTER HIS ARE WORTHLESS
THE TWO WINDOWS ON THE RIGHT AS THE VISITOR STANDS WITH HIS BACK TO THE CHURCH READY TO ENTER IN AT THE FRONT DOOR BELONGING TO MR BRONTE'S STUDY THE TWO ON THE LEFT TO THE FAMILY SITTING-ROOM
SHE LOOKED BACK TO THE LIGHTS AND SUBDUED NOISES OF LONDON--THAT MIGHTY HEART IN WHICH SHE HAD NO PLACE--AND STANDING UP IN THE ROCKING BOAT SHE ASKED TO SPEAK TO SOME ONE IN AUTHORITY ON BOARD THE PACKET
THE CLERGY OF THE DISTRICT WERE THE BRAVEST MEN BY FAR
AN INTERESTING INCIDENT IN THE LIVES OF SOME OF THE MOST EMINENT PERSONS OF THE AGE A TALE JUNE 10TH 1830
ONCE MORE ALLOW ME TO THANK YOU WITH SINCERE GRATITUDE
I CONSIDER IT KIND IN AUNT TO CONSENT TO AN EXTRA SUM FOR A SEPARATE ROOM
SO AS ONE HIGHER THAN SHE HAD OVER-RULED THAT FOR A TIME SHE MIGHT RELAX HER STRAIN SHE RETURNED TO HAWORTH
AND THOUGH MISS BRANWELL KEPT IT IN DUE BOUNDS BY THE VARIETY OF HOUSEHOLD OCCUPATIONS IN WHICH SHE EXPECTED THEM NOT MERELY TO TAKE A PART BUT TO BECOME PROFICIENTS THEREBY OCCUPYING REGULARLY A GOOD PORTION OF EVERY DAY THEY WERE ALLOWED TO GET BOOKS FROM THE CIRCULATING LIBRARY AT KEIGHLEY
BUT IN-DOORS THEY SET WITH VIGOUR TO SHIRT MAKING FOR THE ABSENT BRANWELL AND PONDERED IN SILENCE OVER THEIR PAST AND FUTURE LIFE
THE REAL INTENSITY OF THEIR SUFFERINGS HAS BECOME FORGOTTEN
GREEN SOD AND A GREY MARBLE HEAD-STONE--JESSY SLEEPS BELOW
FROM THE PULPIT HE TOLD THE CONGREGATION THAT INSTEAD OF THEIR SINGING A HYMN HE WOULD READ A CHAPTER
SHE INSISTED THAT SHE HAD NOT MADE THEM THAT SHE HAD HEARD A VOICE REPEAT THEM
THERE WAS A MR ROBERSON OF HEALD'S HALL A FRIEND OF MR BRONTE'S WHO HAS LEFT A DEEP IMPRESSION OF HIMSELF ON THE PUBLIC MIND
AND SHE STOOPING DOWN AND ADDRESSING HIM IN A LOW VOICE TOLD HIM HOW THANKFUL SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT HIS AGE FOR A PIECE OF BREAD
IT IS PITEOUS TO SEE EVEN AN ANIMAL LYING LIFELESS
BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE COOK HAD BEEN KNOWN FOR SOME TIME TO THE WILSON FAMILY WHILE THE TEACHERS WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER FOR AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WORK--THAT OF EDUCATION
AND READ THE MEMOIR OF WILBERFORCE,'--THAT SHORT RECORD OF A BRIEF UNEVENTFUL LIFE
THIS MAN HOWEVER PLANNED AN ESCAPE FOR HIS UNPOPULAR INMATES
AFTER THIS VISIT SHE AND HER FRIEND SEEM TO HAVE AGREED TO CORRESPOND IN FRENCH FOR THE SAKE OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE LANGUAGE
WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED THE FRIEND
SHE DOES NOT TELL ME SHE HAS BEEN ILL AND SHE DOES NOT COMPLAIN
31ST 1845
I CAN WELL IMAGINE THAT THE GRAVE SERIOUS COMPOSURE WHICH WHEN I KNEW HER GAVE HER FACE THE DIGNITY OF AN OLD VENETIAN PORTRAIT WAS NO ACQUISITION OF LATER YEARS BUT DATED FROM THAT EARLY AGE WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE POSITION OF AN ELDER SISTER TO MOTHERLESS CHILDREN
AND I AM ARRIVED AT AN AGE WHEREIN I MUST DO SOMETHING FOR MYSELF
AT FIRST I WAS FOR GIVING ALL UP AND GOING HOME
IF SHE WOULD BE UNHAPPY IN CASE YOU LEFT HER STAY WITH HER
CHILDREN WERE TO THEM THE TROUBLESOME NECESSITIES OF HUMANITY
HOME-SICKNESS AFFECTS ME SORELY
THE PITCHER BROKEN AT THE FOUNTAIN HERE HE CONCLUDED HIS DISCOURSE AND ABRUPTLY WENT HIS WAY
AT THE CLOSE OF THE HALF-YEAR MISS W SOUGHT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF AN EXPLANATION OF EACH OTHER'S WORDS AND THE ISSUE PROVED THAT THE FALLING OUT OF FAITHFUL FRIENDS RENEWING IS OF LOVE AND SO ENDED THE FIRST LAST AND ONLY DIFFERENCE CHARLOTTE EVER HAD WITH GOOD KIND MISS W STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY
J'AI DONNE A MES SOEURS LES POMMES QUE VOUS LEUR ENVOYIEZ AVEC TANT DE BONTE
I CANNOT COUNT THE BELGIANS ANYTHING
IF I ONCE GET TO BRUSSELS AND IF MY HEALTH IS SPARED I WILL DO MY BEST TO MAKE THE UTMOST OF EVERY ADVANTAGE THAT SHALL COME WITHIN MY REACH
HE HAD STRONG HEALTH AND AN ACTIVE BODY AND RODE FAR AND WIDE OVER THE HILLS AWAKENING THOSE WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD NO SENSE OF RELIGION
WE SELDOM SPEAK
THIS LITTLE EXTRA UPSTAIRS ROOM WAS APPROPRIATED TO THE CHILDREN
AND TO THAT END SHE OVERWHELMS ME WITH OCEANS OF NEEDLE-WORK
I LACK A REAL PRETEXT FOR DOING SO
AND I AM NOW I TRUST FAIRLY IN THE WAY TO BE MYSELF AGAIN
FATIGUED WITH LONG CONTINUED EXERCISE--YET RESTLESS STILL AND DOOMED TO ANOTHER WEARY HAUNTED NIGHT OF SLEEPLESSNESS
AT LAST SHE WAS COMPELLED TO KEEP HER BED FOR SOME DAYS AND THIS COMPULSORY REST DID HER GOOD
BUT UNLESS YOU BEGAN TO CATALOGUE THEM YOU WERE HARDLY AWARE OF THE FACT FOR THE EYES AND POWER OF THE COUNTENANCE OVER-BALANCED EVERY PHYSICAL DEFECT
BUT OWING TO SOME NEGLIGENCE THIS RIGHT HAS BEEN LOST TO THE FREEHOLDERS AND TRUSTEES AT HAWORTH EVER SINCE THE DAYS OF ARCHBISHOP SHARP
AND INSTEAD OF TREES THERE ARE ONLY BUSHES AND SHRUBS ABOUT THE DWELLINGS
AND THE METHODISTS HAVE SINCE THOUGHT IT WELL TO ERECT ANOTHER AND A LARGER CHAPEL STILL MORE RETIRED FROM THE ROAD
ALTHOUGH AS SHE SAYS IT WAS A DREARY TIME
LONG BEFORE MARIA BRONTE DIED AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN HER FATHER USED TO SAY HE COULD CONVERSE WITH HER ON ANY OF THE LEADING TOPICS OF THE DAY WITH AS MUCH FREEDOM AND PLEASURE AS WITH ANY GROWN-UP PERSON
SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE OUT OF THE SETTLED CHARACTER AND ISOLATION OF THE NATIVES
THIS LOAD WAS PACKED OVER-NIGHT BUT IN THE MORNING THERE WAS A GREAT GATHERING AROUND IT AND FLASHING OF LANTERNS AND EXAMINATION OF HORSES FEET BEFORE THE PONDEROUS WAGGON GOT UNDER WAY
MAIS IL AVAIT CE COURAGE CETTE CONSTANCE CET ENTHOUSIASME CETTE ENERGIE DE SENTIMENT QUI ECRASE TOUTE OPPOSITION ET QUI FAIT QUE LA VOLONTE D'UN SEUL HOMME DEVIENT LA LOI DE TOUTE UNE NATION
WHERE WERE HIS COMRADES
EXCEPTING AT THESE TWO PERIODS VISITING WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY CONFINED TO TEA-PARTIES WHICH ASSEMBLED AT THREE O'CLOCK BROKE UP AT NINE AND THE AMUSEMENT OF THE EVENING WAS COMMONLY SOME ROUND GAME AT CARDS AS POPE JOAN OR COMMERCE
AT LEAST IT IS IN A LETTER WRITTEN THIS SUMMER THAT I FIND MENTION OF THE FIRST OF A SUCCESSION OF CURATES WHO HENCEFORWARD REVOLVED ROUND HAWORTH PARSONAGE AND MADE AN IMPRESSION ON THE MIND OF ONE OF ITS INMATES WHICH SHE HAS CONVEYED PRETTY DISTINCTLY TO THE WORLD
BRONTE
YET THERE WAS NO ONE TO WHOM THEY COULD APPLY FOR A LOAN OF THE REQUISITE MEANS EXCEPT MISS BRANWELL WHO HAD MADE A SMALL STORE OUT OF HER SAVINGS WHICH SHE INTENDED FOR HER NEPHEW AND NIECES EVENTUALLY BUT WHICH SHE DID NOT LIKE TO RISK
WHAT A CREATURE WOULD THAT BE WHO AFTER RECEIVING AN AFFECTIONATE AND KIND LETTER FROM A BELOVED FRIEND SHOULD SIT DOWN AND WRITE A CATALOGUE OF DEFECTS BY WAY OF ANSWER
I HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO LOOK OVER A SERIES OF NINE LETTERS WHICH WERE ADDRESSED BY HER TO MR BRONTE DURING THE BRIEF TERM OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT IN 1812
AND WHEN WE--THOUGH I AM NOT SURE IF I MYSELF SPOKE--ASKED HER SOME QUESTION AS TO THE OCCASION SHE ALLUDED TO SHE REPLIED WITH RESERVE AND HESITATION EVIDENTLY SHYING AWAY FROM WHAT SHE IMAGINED MIGHT LEAD TO TOO MUCH CONVERSATION ON ONE OF HER BOOKS
THERE ARE ALSO ALLUSIONS TO THE BOOKS SHE HAS READ OR IS READING SHOWING A WELL-CULTIVATED MIND
AND OFFERED TO GIVE IT UP IN FAVOUR OF HER OLD PUPILS THE BRONTES
AND WHILE THE INCUMBENT OF HARTSHEAD HE WOOED AND MARRIED MARIA BRANWELL
BUT THE EXTREME PLEASURE I FELT AT THE NEWS OF THE REFORM BILL'S BEING THROWN OUT BY THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND OF THE EXPULSION OR RESIGNATION OF EARL GREY C CONVINCED ME THAT I HAVE NOT AS YET LOST ALL MY PENCHANT FOR POLITICS
19
MR BRONTE HIMSELF HAD BEEN LIVING AMONGST THESE VERY PEOPLE IN 1812 AS HE WAS THEN CLERGYMAN AT HARTSHEAD NOT THREE MILES FROM RAWFOLDS
THE ONE WITH MARY WHO HAS NOT KEPT HER LETTERS
AND STRAIGHT RETURNED TO HIS WILD YORKSHIRE VILLAGE
THE PLACE WAS COWAN BRIDGE A SMALL HAMLET ON THE COACH-ROAD BETWEEN LEEDS AND KENDAL AND THUS EASY OF ACCESS FROM HAWORTH AS THE COACH RAN DAILY AND ONE OF ITS STAGES WAS AT KEIGHLEY
SOMETHING BE DERIVED FROM THEIR ROUGH NORSE ANCESTRY
DOWN-STAIRS CAME EMILY DRAGGING AFTER HER THE UNWILLING KEEPER HIS HIND LEGS SET IN A HEAVY ATTITUDE OF RESISTANCE HELD BY THE SCUFT OF HIS NECK BUT GROWLING LOW AND SAVAGELY ALL THE TIME
THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL REMARKABLE IN ANY OF THE OTHER REGULATIONS A COPY OF WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS IN MR BRONTE'S HANDS WHEN HE FORMED THE DETERMINATION TO SEND HIS DAUGHTERS TO COWAN BRIDGE SCHOOL
P.S.--MR W
THEIR RANGE OF CHOICE HAS BEEN WIDENED BY HEARING MUCH OF WHAT IS NOT USUALLY CONSIDERED TO INTEREST CHILDREN
PAPA ADVISED HER TO LEAVE HIM FOR EVER AND GO HOME IF SHE HAD A HOME TO GO TO
THE CASES ARE RARE IN WHICH THE POSSESSORS OF GREAT GIFTS HAVE KNOWN THE BLESSINGS OF THAT CARELESS HAPPY TIME
IL EST LA EXILE ET CAPTIF ENCHAINE SUR UN ECUEIL
THIS SHE HAS BEEN INDUCED TO DO BY HER KNOWLEDGE OF THE URGENT DESIRE ON THE PART OF MR BRONTE THAT THE LIFE OF HIS DAUGHTER SHOULD BE WRITTEN AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH A REQUEST FROM HER HUSBAND THAT I SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO HAVE THE USE OF THESE LETTERS WITHOUT WHICH SUCH A TASK COULD BE BUT VERY IMPERFECTLY EXECUTED
THEY ARE SCATTERED FAR AND WIDE
MR CARTWRIGHT WAS A VERY REMARKABLE MAN HAVING AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD SOME FOREIGN BLOOD IN HIM THE TRACES OF WHICH WERE VERY APPARENT IN HIS TALL FIGURE DARK EYES AND COMPLEXION AND SINGULAR THOUGH GENTLEMANLY BEARING
IF IT BE A BREACH OF ETIQUETTE NEVER MIND
IN MANY LIVING AS IT WERE IN A CHURCHYARD AND WITH ALL THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS CONNECTED WITH THE LAST OFFICES TO THE DEAD THINGS OF EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE THE VERY FAMILIARITY WOULD HAVE BRED INDIFFERENCE
SOME ONE MUST FIRST MOVE TOWARDS A SETTLEMENT BUT A SPIRIT BEING EVOKED WHICH COULD NOT BE ALLAYED ACTION BECAME PERPLEXING
GOOD-BYE MY DARLING E C
THERE IS ANOTHER SCRAP OF PAPER IN THIS ALL BUT ILLEGIBLE HANDWRITING WRITTEN ABOUT THIS TIME AND WHICH GIVES SOME IDEA OF THE SOURCES OF THEIR OPINIONS
A KIND OF SYMPATHETIC TACT WHICH INSTINCTIVELY PERCEIVES THE DIFFICULTIES THAT IMPEDE COMPREHENSION IN A CHILD'S MIND AND THAT YET ARE TOO VAGUE AND UNFORMED FOR IT WITH ITS HALF-DEVELOPED POWERS OF EXPRESSION TO EXPLAIN BY WORDS
WHEN IT IS USED ONLY AS IN THE CASE YOU STATE FOR THE EXERCISE AND AMUSEMENT OF AN HOUR AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SURELY MAY WITHOUT ANY BREACH OF GOD'S COMMANDMENTS BE ALLOWED A LITTLE LIGHT-HEARTEDNESS THESE CONSEQUENCES CANNOT FOLLOW
BRANWELL I HAVE MENTIONED HAD OBTAINED THE SITUATION OF A PRIVATE TUTOR
I THOUGHT THEM CONDENSED AND TERSE VIGOROUS AND GENUINE
HE WAS STUPIFIED
WHEREAS RESERVE IS INDIFFERENT WHETHER IT PLEASES OR NOT
WE TAKE HIM UP NOW SETTLED AS A CURATE AT HARTSHEAD IN YORKSHIRE--FAR REMOVED FROM HIS BIRTH-PLACE AND ALL HIS IRISH CONNECTIONS
BUT IT CURTAINS IT FROM POLE TO POLE
I HAVE SEEN AN OIL PAINTING OF HIS DONE I KNOW NOT WHEN BUT PROBABLY ABOUT THIS TIME
BRANWELL HER DARLING WAS TO HAVE HAD HIS SHARE
PARTLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE HARSH TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED AND PARTLY BECAUSE HER STAY AT HOME DURING HER SISTERS ABSENCE IN BELGIUM SEEMED DESIRABLE WHEN THE AGE OF THE THREE REMAINING INHABITANTS OF THE PARSONAGE WAS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
AFTER SOME CORRESPONDENCE AND MUCH TALKING OVER PLANS AT HOME IT SEEMED BETTER IN CONSEQUENCE OF LETTERS WHICH THEY RECEIVED FROM BRUSSELS GIVING A DISCOURAGING ACCOUNT OF THE SCHOOLS THERE THAT CHARLOTTE AND EMILY SHOULD GO TO AN INSTITUTION AT LILLE IN THE NORTH OF FRANCE WHICH WAS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY BAPTIST NOEL AND OTHER CLERGYMEN
CHARLOTTE NEVER WAS IN WILD EXCITEMENT THAT I KNOW OF
BUT BEFORE HER TONGUE WAS THUS LOOSENED SHE HAD A HABIT OF GRADUALLY WHEELING ROUND ON HER CHAIR SO AS ALMOST TO CONCEAL HER FACE FROM THE PERSON TO WHOM SHE WAS SPEAKING
THIS SOUNDS VERY FAIR BUT STILL THERE ARE MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED WHICH THROW SOMETHING OF A DAMP UPON THE SCHEME
I HAVE WRITTEN ALSO TO MRS B AND HAVE ENCLOSED THE DIPLOMA WHICH M
AS TABBY CLOSED THE DOOR I ASKED HER IF SHE KNEW HIM
WHICH I COULD NOT CONTRADICT AS I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIM
OUR PLAYS WERE ESTABLISHED
SHE HAS SO MUCH TO ENDURE
BETWEEN THE BRACKETS WHICH SUPPORT THE TABLET IS INSCRIBED THE SACRED MONOGRAM I.H.S IN OLD ENGLISH LETTERS
IN THE MORNING FROM NINE O'CLOCK TILL HALF-PAST TWELVE I INSTRUCT MY SISTERS AND DRAW
THE OTHER END FORMS A COTTAGE WITH THE LOW CEILINGS AND STONE FLOORS OF A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
THE BEEF THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY SALTED BEFORE IT WAS DRESSED HAD OFTEN BECOME TAINTED FROM NEGLECT
NO SALARIES HOWEVER ARE OFFERED
BELL ARE DESIROUS FOR THE PRESENT OF REMAINING UNKNOWN FOR WHICH REASON THEY PREFER HAVING THE NOTE POSTED IN LONDON TO SENDING IT DIRECT IN ORDER TO AVOID GIVING ANY CLUE TO RESIDENCE OR IDENTITY BY POST-MARK C ONCE MORE IN SEPTEMBER SHE WRITES AS THE WORK HAS RECEIVED NO FURTHER NOTICE FROM ANY PERIODICAL I PRESUME THE DEMAND FOR IT HAS NOT GREATLY INCREASED IN THE BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF HER SISTERS SHE THUS SPEAKS OF THE FAILURE OF THE MODEST HOPES VESTED IN THIS PUBLICATION
I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT AGONY THESE SYMPTOMS GIVE ME
SUCH A DARK SHADOW CAME OVER HER FACE WHEN I SAID THINK OF WHAT YOU'LL BE FIVE YEARS HENCE THAT I STOPPED AND SAID DON'T CRY CHARLOTTE SHE DID NOT CRY BUT WENT ON WALKING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM AND SAID IN A LITTLE WHILE BUT I INTEND TO STAY POLLY A FEW WEEKS AFTER SHE PARTED FROM MARY SHE GIVES THIS ACCOUNT OF HER DAYS AT HAWORTH
PEOPLE SHOULD DO RIGHT AS FAR AS THEIR ABILITY EXTENDS
SHE THOUGHT WE DID NOT KNOW HOW LONG THE MOMENT OF DISSOLUTION MIGHT REALLY BE OR HOW TERRIBLE
THERE WAS ANOTHER ENGLISH FAMILY WHERE CHARLOTTE SOON BECAME A WELCOME GUEST AND WHERE I SUSPECT SHE FELT HERSELF MORE AT HER EASE THAN EITHER AT MRS JENKINS OR THE FRIENDS WHOM I HAVE FIRST MENTIONED
SHE SAID SHE NEVER WANTED
HITHERTO BOTH EMILY AND I HAVE HAD GOOD HEALTH AND THEREFORE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WELL
IT IS A LONG BOW-WINDOWED COTTAGE NOW DIVIDED INTO TWO DWELLINGS
IN CASE OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POEMS APPEARING WHETHER FAVOURABLE OR OTHERWISE MESSRS
I FEEL AS IF WE WERE ALL BURIED HERE
WHEREUPON MR GRIMSHAW STOOD UP IN HIS PLACE AND SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE OH SIR
AND WHEN HE RESTS SLEEPS ON SOME SOFT WHITE BED OF DREAMS UNPUNISHED WHEN HE AWAKENS TO THE LIFE OF THE LAND OF SHADOWS
PEOPLE IN HAWORTH HAVE ASSURED ME THAT ACCORDING TO THE HOUR OF DAY--NAY THE VERY MINUTE--COULD THEY HAVE TOLD WHAT THE INHABITANTS OF THE PARSONAGE WERE ABOUT
WHEN DO YOU WISH TO GO
AUNT WISHED ME TO GIVE YOU THIS INFORMATION BEFORE BUT PAPA AND ALL THE REST WERE ANXIOUS I SHOULD DELAY UNTIL WE SAW WHETHER MATTERS TOOK A MORE SETTLED ASPECT AND I MYSELF KEPT PUTTING IT OFF FROM DAY TO DAY MOST BITTERLY RELUCTANT TO GIVE UP ALL THE PLEASURE I HAD ANTICIPATED SO LONG
AND THE POWER OF CHOOSING A MINISTER HAS LAPSED INTO THE HANDS OF THE VICAR OF BRADFORD
OF HER FREQUENT DISGRACE FROM THIS LAST FAULT--OF HER SUFFERINGS SO PATIENTLY BORNE--I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN
TALE TO HIS SONS
I HASTENED TO KOEKELBERG THE NEXT MORNING--UNCONSCIOUS THAT SHE WAS IN GREAT DANGER--AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS FINISHED
BRAVE HEART READY TO DIE IN HARNESS
MY HOPES EBB LOW INDEED ABOUT BRANWELL
MARIA BRONTE THE ELDEST OF SIX COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN A FEW MONTHS MORE THAN SIX YEARS OLD WHEN MR BRONTE REMOVED TO HAWORTH ON FEBRUARY THE 25TH 1820
BUT HIS RECKLESS EXPENDITURE HAD DISTRESSED THE GOOD OLD LADY AND HIS NAME WAS OMITTED IN HER WILL
1_L
1_L
OLD WAYS OF LIVING FORMER INHABITANTS DECAYED GENTRY WHO HAD MELTED AWAY AND WHOSE PLACES KNEW THEM NO MORE
IL DEROBA LE FEU DU CIEL POUR ANIMER LE CORPS QU'IL AVAIT FORME
AS A SLIGHT ILLUSTRATION OF THE ROUGHNESS THAT PERVADES ALL CLASSES IN THESE OUT-OF THE-WAY VILLAGES I MAY RELATE A LITTLE ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO MY HUSBAND AND MYSELF THREE YEARS AGO AT ADDINGHAM FROM PENIGENT TO PENDLE HILL FROM LINTON TO LONG-_ADDINGHAM AND ALL THAT CRAVEN COASTS DID TELL C ONE OF THE PLACES THAT SENT FORTH ITS FIGHTING MEN TO THE FAMOUS OLD BATTLE OF FLODDEN FIELD AND A VILLAGE NOT MANY MILES FROM HAWORTH
C'EST SOUVENT L'ORDRE DU CIEL QUE QUAND ON A PERDU UN PLAISIR IL Y EN A UN AUTRE PRET A PRENDRE SA PLACE
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT IN THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NO RURAL CONSTABULARY
ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE BEEN MOST UNCERTAIN PERPLEXED WITH CONTRADICTORY SCHEMES AND PROPOSALS
VOUS VOUS EFFRAYEZ A TORT D'UN MOT SI DUR
VOUS ME PARDONNEREZ SI NOUS VOUS PARLONS DE VOS ENFANTS SI NOUS NOUS OCCUPONS DE LEUR AVENIR COMME SI ELLES FAISAIENT PARTIE DE NOTRE FAMILLE
IT MEANS RATHER A SHREWD VERY UGLY MEDDLING TALKING WOMAN I FEEL RELUCTANT TO LEAVE PAPA FOR A SINGLE DAY
THE SEXTON STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE OPEN GRAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THE ARVILL WOULD BE HELD AT THE BLACK BULL OR WHATEVER PUBLIC-HOUSE MIGHT BE FIXED UPON BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DEAD
CHARLOTTE WAS MORE THAN COMMONLY TENDER IN HER TREATMENT OF ALL DUMB CREATURES AND THEY WITH THAT FINE INSTINCT SO OFTEN NOTICED WERE INVARIABLY ATTRACTED TOWARDS HER
IT WUR THE FACTORIES AS HAD DRIVEN EM AWAY SHE SAID
THIS DESCRIPTION OF UNCERTAIN YET PERPETUAL EMPLOYMENT SUBJECT TO THE EXERCISE OF ANOTHER PERSON'S WILL AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY WAS PECULIARLY TRYING TO ONE WHOSE LIFE AT HOME HAD BEEN FULL OF ABUNDANT LEISURE
BUT IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE DIFFICULTIES SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER IN HER VARIOUS PHASES OF LIFE SHOULD BE FAIRLY AND FRANKLY MADE KNOWN BEFORE THE FORCE OF WHAT WAS RESISTED CAN BE AT ALL UNDERSTOOD
AT PUNCTUAL EIGHT THE HOUSEHOLD ASSEMBLED TO EVENING PRAYERS IN HIS STUDY
I DID NOT DESERVE IT ALL FOUR CHILDREN HOPED TO MEET TOGETHER AT THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE THIS DECEMBER
BY SCORES WOULD THEY WEND THEIR WAY FROM THE HILLS TO ATTEND A VESTRY MEETING AT BRADFORD AND IN SUCH SERVICE FAILED NOT TO SHOW LESS OF THE SUAVITER IN MODO THAN THE FORTITER IN RE
YOU ASK ABOUT QUEEN VICTORIA'S VISIT TO BRUSSELS
AND WHEN I HEARD THAT I THOUGHT I WOULD GO AS SOON AS I COULD TO SEE HER
BUT ONE DAY AT THE CHILDREN'S DINNER THE SMALL TRUANT OF THE STABLE-YARD IN A LITTLE DEMONSTRATIVE GUSH SAID PUTTING HIS HAND IN HERS I LOVE OU MISS BRONTE WHEREUPON THE MOTHER EXCLAIMED BEFORE ALL THE CHILDREN LOVE THE GOVERNESS MY DEAR THE FAMILY INTO WHICH SHE FIRST ENTERED WAS I BELIEVE THAT OF A WEALTHY YORKSHIRE MANUFACTURER
I CAN SEE THE WELL OF LIFE IN ALL ITS CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS
KEIGHLEY IS A SMALL TOWN FOUR MILES FROM HERE
THEY HAD NEVER BEEN DRAWN INTO CONTACT WITH THEM IN ANY OTHER WAY
WHEN IN THE DUSK ONE WINTER EVENING HE CAME STALKING ALONG THE LANE AND THROUGH THE HALL AND UP THE STAIRS INTO HIS OWN ROOM WHERE HE VANISHED
I TRY TO READ I TRY TO WRITE
OTHERWISE I AM WELL IN HEALTH
A HEALTHY MERRY CHILD SHE DID NOT MUCH CARE FOR DRESS OR EATING
A HOSPITAL IN THE ANCIENT LARGE MEANING OF THE WORD SUCCEEDED TO THE KENNEL
THENCE STILL FASTING TO THE CHURCH WHERE AS HE WAS READING THE SECOND LESSON HE FELL DOWN AND ON HIS PARTIAL RECOVERY HAD TO BE LED FROM THE CHURCH
SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND TABBY AND CHARLOTTE STOOD IN THE GLOOMY PASSAGE BELOW FULL OF THE DARK SHADOWS OF COMING NIGHT
HE CAME AND HER QUIET SIMPLE STATEMENT OF HER WISH AND HER REASON FOR IT QUELLED THE FEELING OF SNEERING DISTRUST IN THOSE WHO HAD FIRST HEARD HER REQUEST
I HAVE ANSWERED ADVERTISEMENTS WITHOUT NUMBER BUT MY APPLICATIONS HAVE MET WITH NO SUCCESS
THEY MADE ONE UNANIMOUS AND STIFF REMONSTRANCE
IT WAS MONDAY BAKING DAY AND I WAS HOT AND TIRED
SHE WRITES THUS JULY 21ST 1832 OF HER COURSE OF LIFE AT THE PARSONAGE AN ACCOUNT OF ONE DAY IS AN ACCOUNT OF ALL
CAN YOU GIVE ME A NOTION OF THE COST
BUT NOTHING OF ALL THIS CAN BE EVER BEGUN WITHOUT MEANS AND AS I DON'T POSSESS THESE I MUST IN EVERY SHAPE STRIVE TO GAIN THEM
IN THAT CASE I WILL SEND IT IMMEDIATELY
BUT IN WINTER ALL SUCH COMMUNICATION WAS IMPOSSIBLE BY REASON OF THE SNOW WHICH LAY LONG AND LATE ON THE BLEAK HIGH GROUND
IF I COULD ALWAYS LIVE WITH YOU AND DAILY READ THE BIBLE WITH YOU--IF YOUR LIPS AND MINE COULD AT THE SAME TIME DRINK THE SAME DRAUGHT FROM THE SAME PURE FOUNTAIN OF MERCY--I HOPE I TRUST I MIGHT ONE DAY BECOME BETTER FAR BETTER THAN MY EVIL WANDERING THOUGHTS MY CORRUPT HEART COLD TO THE SPIRIT AND WARM TO THE FLESH WILL NOW PERMIT ME TO BE
TO CONVERSE WITH HER SOMETIMES C
OF FRENCH THEY KNEW SOMETHING
IT IS A SORROWFUL THOUGHT
THEY KEPT THEMSELVES VERY CLOSE IS THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY THOSE WHO REMEMBER MR AND MRS BRONTE'S COMING AMONGST THEM
DANS UN SIECLE L'EUROPE ENTIERE SAURA COMBIEN WELLINGTON A DES DROITS A SA RECONNAISSANCE HOW OFTEN IN WRITING THIS PAPER IN A STRANGE LAND MUST MISS BRONTE HAVE THOUGHT OF THE OLD CHILDISH DISPUTES IN THE KITCHEN OF HAWORTH PARSONAGE TOUCHING THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF WELLINGTON AND BUONAPARTE
HE LOVED TO STEAL UPSTAIRS AND STRETCH HIS SQUARE TAWNY LIMBS ON THE COMFORTABLE BEDS COVERED OVER WITH DELICATE WHITE COUNTERPANES
VIZ THE TWELVE ADVENTURERS AND THE ADVENTURES IN IRELAND APRIL 2ND 1829
AND FROM IT MAY BE GATHERED SOME CURIOUS PARTICULARS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH A ROUGH POPULATION WERE SWAYED AND GOVERNED BY A MAN OF DEEP CONVICTIONS AND STRONG EARNESTNESS OF PURPOSE
A HAWORTH CARRIER CALLED AT THE OFFICE OF A FRIEND OF MINE TO DELIVER A PARCEL ON A COLD WINTER'S DAY AND STOOD WITH THE DOOR OPEN
GOOD-BYE
GOOD-BYE
EMILY AND I JUMPED OUT OF BED AND I SNATCHED UP ONE AND EXCLAIMED THIS IS THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON
NO DOUBT SHE HAD MANY A TALE TO TELL OF BY GONE DAYS OF THE COUNTRY-SIDE
SHE CAUGHT AT THE IDEA MOST EAGERLY AT FIRST
THEY WERE SHY OF MEETING EVEN FAMILIAR FACES AND WERE SCRUPULOUS ABOUT ENTERING THE HOUSE OF THE VERY POOREST UNINVITED
AS TO MY EMPLOYERS YOU WILL NOT EXPECT ME TO SAY MUCH ABOUT THEIR CHARACTERS WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I ONLY ARRIVED HERE YESTERDAY
SAMEDI 5 OBRE
ON A REMOTE PART OF THE WALLS MAY STILL BE READ PHILLIPPO IIII
AND BREAD FOR SUPPER
YOU DO NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR OWN HEALTH BUT I HOPE YOU ARE WELL AND EMILY ALSO
HE HAS NO IDEA THAT LITTLE JESSY WILL DIE YOUNG SHE IS SO GAY AND CHATTERING AND ARCH--ORIGINAL EVEN NOW
PARISH IT IS NOTHING TO SPEAK OF HAS PRODUCED THE SAME EFFECTS ON THE CONTENTS OF MY KNOWLEDGE-BOX THAT A QUAIGH OF USQUEBAUGH DOES UPON THOSE OF MOST OTHER BIPEDS
THE PEOPLE OF HAWORTH WERE NOT LESS STRONG AND FULL OF CHARACTER THAN THEIR NEIGHBOURS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE HILLS
THESE MISGIVINGS ARE PARTLY DONE AWAY WITH
THEN HE WOULD DESIRE THEM TO REMEMBER THAT THE ROYALIST AND COMMONWEALTH MEN HAD EACH THEIR DIFFERENT OPINIONS OF THE GREAT PROTECTOR
ONCE MORE SHE SEEMED SINKING BUT THIS TIME SHE RALLIED THROUGH THE MERE FORCE OF RESOLUTION
THE HEAP OF COALS ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE-DOOR AND THE BREWING TUBS ON THE OTHER AND THE FREQUENT PERFUME OF MALT AND HOPS AS YOU WALKED ALONG PROVED THAT FIRE AND HOME-BREWED WERE TO BE FOUND AT ALMOST EVERY MAN'S HEARTH
SHE WROTE ON ITS BLANK LEAF PAPA LENT ME THIS BOOK THIS BOOK IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS OLD
I WAS WELL AWARE INDEED THAT AUNT HAD MONEY BUT I ALWAYS CONSIDERED THAT SHE WAS THE LAST PERSON WHO WOULD OFFER A LOAN FOR THE PURPOSE IN QUESTION
PARDON ME FOR I CANNOT HELP IT
SHE RULED OVER A NEW SCHOOLROOM WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT ON THE SPACE IN THE PLAY-GROUND ADJOINING THE HOUSE
I HAVE HAD TWO LETTERS FROM MARY
I WILL NOT HELP YOU AT ALL IN THE DISCOVERY
VINCENT DE PAUL DONT JE T'AI DEJA PARLE ET NE SE CONTENTE PAS DE SERVIR LES PAUVRES ET LES MALADES MAIS LEUR CONSACRE ENCORE LES SOIREES
THE MATTER HAD TO BE REFERRED TO SOME INDEPENDENT ARBITRATOR AND MY FATHER WAS THE GENTLEMAN TO WHOM EACH PARTY TURNED ITS EYE
TRUE AGAIN
BESIDES SHE WILL BE COMPANY FOR EMILY WHO WITHOUT HER WOULD BE VERY LONELY I GAVE A DEVOIR WRITTEN AFTER SHE HAD BEEN FOUR MONTHS UNDER M
HAWORTH JULY 6TH 1835
THEIR AUNT HAD AN ANNUITY OF 50_L BUT IT REVERTED TO OTHERS AT HER DEATH AND HER NIECES HAD NO RIGHT AND WERE THE LAST PERSONS IN THE WORLD TO RECKON UPON HER SAVINGS
ADVERSITY IS A GOOD SCHOOL
NON-SEULEMENT PIERRE VOIT CES MERVEILLES MAIS IL LES FAIT VOIR A TOUS CEUX QUI L'ENTOURENT
I NEVER HAD SUCH A CHANCE OF ENJOYMENT BEFORE
THEY TOOK A VIVID INTEREST IN THE PUBLIC CHARACTERS AND THE LOCAL AND THE FOREIGN AS WELL AS HOME POLITICS DISCUSSED IN THE NEWSPAPERS
THINGS HERE AT HOME ARE MUCH AS USUAL
NOW EMILY WAS FAR AWAY IN HAWORTH--WHERE SHE OR ANY OTHER LOVED ONE MIGHT DIE BEFORE CHARLOTTE WITH HER UTMOST SPEED COULD REACH THEM AS EXPERIENCE IN HER AUNT'S CASE HAD TAUGHT HER
AND AMONG THEM BELOVED AND RESPECTED BY ALL LAUGHED AT OCCASIONALLY BY A FEW BUT ALWAYS TO HER FACE--LIVED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF THE PLAIN SHORT-SIGHTED ODDLY-DRESSED STUDIOUS LITTLE GIRL THEY CALLED CHARLOTTE BRONTE
BUT IF I WROTE TO HER SHE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MRS JENKINS THE WIFE OF THE BRITISH CHAPLAIN WOULD BE ABLE TO SECURE ME A CHEAP DECENT RESIDENCE AND RESPECTABLE PROTECTION
2ND A SHORT UNTITLED POEM
DISMISSED HIM
THIS WAS A TERRIBLE THREAT FOR HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO LEAVE HIS FAMILY WITH ONLY ONE OR TWO SOLDIERS TO DEFEND THEM
THE LOWER CLASS WAS THEN EXTREMELY IGNORANT AND ALL CLASSES WERE VERY SUPERSTITIOUS
SO THAT IN FACT PARSONAGE CHURCH AND BELFRIED SCHOOL-HOUSE FORM THREE SIDES OF AN IRREGULAR OBLONG OF WHICH THE FOURTH IS OPEN TO THE FIELDS AND MOORS THAT LIE BEYOND
EMILY HAD GIVEN UP HER SITUATION IN THE HALIFAX SCHOOL AT THE EXPIRATION OF SIX MONTHS OF ARDUOUS TRIAL ON ACCOUNT OF HER HEALTH WHICH COULD ONLY BE RE-ESTABLISHED BY THE BRACING MOORLAND AIR AND FREE LIFE OF HOME
WHICH LATELY CAME TO MY KNOWLEDGE WHICH GIVES A GLIMPSE OF THE BETTER SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER
WELL HE DIDNA SAY HE WOULDNA COME BUT TELL HIM THE LAD MAY BLEED TO DEATH I DID AND WHAT DID HE SAY WHY ONLY D-N HIM
IT IS HARD WORK TO PROVIDE FOR THE LITTLE TENDER WANTS OF MANY YOUNG CHILDREN WHERE THE MEANS ARE BUT LIMITED
I SOMETIMES FEAR HE WILL NEVER BE FIT FOR MUCH
IN A LETTER WHICH I HAD FROM HIM ON THIS SUBJECT THEIR FATHER WRITES:--"THE SERVANTS OFTEN SAID THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A CLEVER LITTLE CHILD AS CHARLOTTE AND THAT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO BE ON THEIR GUARD AS TO WHAT THEY SAID AND DID BEFORE HER
BUT EXCITE SUSPICION OR RESENTMENT AND THEY GIVE EMPHATIC AND NOT IMPOTENT RESISTANCE
FAMILY TRAGEDIES AND DARK SUPERSTITIOUS DOOMS
JE NE CONNAIS PAS PERSONNELLEMENT M
I WAS SENT HITHER AND THITHER UNTIL IT OCCURRED TO ME TO ASK FOR JONATHAN O TH GATE MY DIFFICULTIES WERE THEN AT AN END
IT IS AN ANSWER TO THE LETTER YOU FORWARDED WHICH CONTAINED AN APPLICATION FOR THEIR AUTOGRAPHS FROM A PERSON WHO PROFESSED TO HAVE READ AND ADMIRED THEIR POEMS
QUE L'ANGLETERRE SE MONTRE CLEMENTE QU'ELLE OUVRE SES BRAS POUR RECEVOIR COMME HOTE SON ENNEMI DESARME L'ANGLETERRE AURAIT PEUT-ETRE ECOUTE CE CONSEII CAR PARTOUT ET TOUJOURS IL Y A DES AMES FAIBLES ET TIMOREES BIENTOT SEDUITES PAR LA FLATTERIE OU EFFRAYEES PAR LE REPROCHE
I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT HELEN BURNS IS AS EXACT A TRANSCRIPT OF MARIA BRONTE AS CHARLOTTE'S WONDERFUL POWER OF REPRODUCING CHARACTER COULD GIVE
AND ALTOGETHER HER POSITION WAS THAT OF BONNE OR NURSERY GOVERNESS LIABLE TO REPEATED AND NEVER-ENDING CALLS UPON HER TIME
SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT SHE WAS WANTED IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AND IT WAS MARIA AND ELIZABETH
SHE THOUGHT SUCH SENSITIVENESS TO OMENS WAS LIKE THE CHOLERA PRESENT TO SUSCEPTIBLE PEOPLE,--SOME FEELING MORE SOME LESS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF 1834 E WENT TO LONDON FOR THE FIRST TIME
AFTER SHE HAD BEEN AT HOME ABOUT A WEEK HER FRIEND PROPOSED THAT SHE SHOULD ACCOMPANY HER IN SOME LITTLE EXCURSION HAVING PLEASURE ALONE FOR ITS OBJECT
SHE HAD HAD A GREAT QUANTITY OF BLAIR'S LECTURES ON BELLES LETTRES TO READ
THEY TELL OF ONE LONG SERIES OF KIND AND THOUGHTFUL ACTIONS FROM THIS EARLY PERIOD TO THE LAST WEEKS OF CHARLOTTE BRONTE'S LIFE
ALTHOUGH NOT A MAGISTRATE HE SPARED NO PAINS TO TRACK OUT THE LUDDITES CONCERNED IN THE ASSASSINATION I HAVE MENTIONED
SHE IS MORE LONELY--LESS GIFTED WITH THE POWER OF MAKING FRIENDS EVEN THAN I AM
THE BEDS OF THE TWO MISS BRONTES WERE AT THE EXTREME END OF THE ROOM ALMOST AS PRIVATE AND RETIRED AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IN A SEPARATE APARTMENT
AND AT THEIR HOUSE CHARLOTTE AND EMILY WERE ALWAYS WELCOME THOUGH THEIR OVERPOWERING SHYNESS PREVENTED THEIR MORE VALUABLE QUALITIES FROM BEING KNOWN AND GENERALLY KEPT THEM SILENT
SHE NOW FELT THAT SHE HAD MADE GREAT PROGRESS TOWARDS OBTAINING PROFICIENCY IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE WHICH HAD BEEN HER MAIN OBJECT IN COMING TO BRUSSELS
AND THEREFORE I HEARTILY WISH I COULD HEAR OF A FAMILY WHERE THEY NEED SUCH A COMMODITY AS A GOVERNESS CHAPTER IX THE YEAR 1840 FOUND ALL THE BRONTES LIVING AT HOME EXCEPT ANNE
A CLERGYMAN LIVING NEAR KIRBY LONSDALE THE REVEREND WILLIAM CARUS WILSON WAS THE PRIME MOVER IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS SCHOOL
WE HAD TWO SERMONS ON DISSENT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES PREACHED LAST SUNDAY--ONE IN THE AFTERNOON BY MR W AND ONE IN THE EVENING BY MR C
FIRST YOUNG MEN PAPA BOUGHT BRANWELL SOME WOODEN SOLDIERS AT LEEDS
EVEN BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE ON THE MORNING AFTER THEY RECEIVED THE FIRST INTELLIGENCE OF ILLNESS--WHEN THEY WERE ON THE VERY POINT OF STARTING--CAME A SECOND LETTER TELLING THEM OF THEIR AUNT'S DEATH
AND IF YOU WALK TO IT FROM BIRSTALL STATION ABOUT MEAL-TIME YOU ENCOUNTER STRINGS OF MILL-HANDS BLUE WITH WOOLLEN DYE AND CRANCHING IN HUNGRY HASTE OVER THE CINDER-PATHS BORDERING THE HIGH ROAD
AND IN THE ANXIETY OF THE ELDER TO MAKE HER YOUNGER SISTER CONTENTED SHE ALLOWED HER TO EXERCISE A KIND OF UNCONSCIOUS TYRANNY OVER HER
THE OTHER DAY MR A VICAR CAME TO SPEND THE DAY WITH US BRINGING WITH HIM HIS OWN CURATE
THEY SAY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND ARE SO NUMEROUS COMPETITION SO GREAT THAT WITHOUT SOME SUCH STEP TOWARDS ATTAINING SUPERIORITY WE SHALL PROBABLY HAVE A VERY HARD STRUGGLE AND MAY FAIL IN THE END
MY DEAR MISS W I HAVE NOT YET PAID MY VISIT TO
FORGIVE UNDUE WARMTH BECAUSE MY FEELINGS IN THIS MATTER CANNOT BE COOL
I HOPE SHE KEEPS WELL AND ABOUT THIS TIME SHE WROTE TO HER FATHER JUNE 2ND 1818 I WAS VERY GLAD TO HEAR FROM HOME
NOT VERY BRIGHT AS IT REGARDS BRANWELL THOUGH HIS HEALTH AND CONSEQUENTLY HIS TEMPER HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT BETTER THIS LAST DAY OR TWO BECAUSE HE IS NOW FORCED TO ABSTAIN AUGUST 18TH 1845
SOMETHING SEEMED NEAR ME 4 FROM THAT TIME MARY ADDS HER IMAGINATIONS BECAME GLOOMY OR FRIGHTFUL
BELL FOR YOUR OBLIGING OFFER OF ADVICE
THE SAME DAY WAS ALSO THE WEDDING-DAY OF HER YOUNGER SISTER CHARLOTTE BRANWELL IN DISTANT PENZANCE
IN SOME OF THE NOTICES OF THE PREVIOUS EDITIONS OF THIS WORK IT IS ASSUMED THAT I DERIVED THE GREATER PART OF MY INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO HER SOJOURN AT COWAN BRIDGE FROM CHARLOTTE BRONTE HERSELF
AND IF FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID YOU CAN MAKE A ROUGH CALCULATION ON THE SUBJECT I SHOULD BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU IN HER NEXT LETTER FEBRUARY 6TH SHE SAYS YOU WILL PERCEIVE THAT THE POEMS ARE THE WORK OF THREE PERSONS RELATIVES--THEIR SEPARATE PIECES ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE SIGNATURES SHE WRITES AGAIN ON FEBRUARY 15TH
I SHOULD INDEED LIKE TO GO
ALORS NOUS AURIONS PU SI CELA VOUS EUT CONVENU OFFRIR A MESDEMOISELLES VOS FILLES OU DU MOINS A L'UNE DES DEUX UNE POSITION QUI EUT ETE DANS SES GOUTS ET QUI LUI EUT DONNE CETTE DOUCE INDEPENDANCE SI DIFFICILE A TROUVER POUR UNE JEUNE PERSONNE
WHEN A DISPUTE WOULD NOT UNFREQUENTLY ARISE AMONGST THEM REGARDING THE COMPARATIVE MERITS OF HIM BUONAPARTE HANNIBAL AND CAESAR
BUT EMILY--THAT FREE WILD UNTAMEABLE SPIRIT NEVER HAPPY NOR WELL BUT ON THE SWEEPING MOORS THAT GATHERED ROUND HER HOME--THAT HATER OF STRANGERS DOOMED TO LIVE AMONGST THEM AND NOT MERELY TO LIVE BUT TO SLAVE IN THEIR SERVICE--WHAT CHARLOTTE COULD HAVE BORNE PATIENTLY FOR HERSELF SHE COULD NOT BEAR FOR HER SISTER
MARTHA IS NOW VERY WELL
WHEN A NEWLY-MARRIED COUPLE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE AT CHAPEL IT WAS THE CUSTOM TO SING THE WEDDING ANTHEM JUST AFTER THE LAST PRAYER AND AS THE CONGREGATION WAS QUITTING THE CHAPEL
THEY PLANNED FOR THE FUTURE AND CONSULTED EACH OTHER AS TO THEIR PLANS
THE EXTERNES OR MORNING PUPILS WHO HAD BROUGHT THEIR OWN REFRESHMENT WITH THEM ADJOURNING TO EAT IT IN THE GARDEN
SHE WAS AN INDEFATIGABLE STUDENT
ALTOGETHER NOT SO PLEASANT A PLACE AS HARTSHEAD WITH ITS AMPLE OUTLOOK OVER CLOUD-SHADOWED SUN-FLECKED PLAIN AND HILL RISING BEYOND HILL TO FORM THE DISTANT HORIZON
TO SAVE TIME AND BE NO CHARGE TO THE FAMILIES AT WHOSE HOUSES HE HELD HIS PRAYER-MEETINGS HE CARRIED HIS PROVISIONS WITH HIM
AND IN RETURN THE GRATEFUL CITY WHICH HAD LONG WANTED A NEARER ROAD TO ST GUDULE BUT BEEN BAFFLED BY THE NOBLE ARCHERS CALLED THE STREET AFTER HER NAME
BEFORE SPEAKING OF THE RESULTS IT MAY BE DESIRABLE TO GIVE AN EXTRACT FROM ONE OF HER LETTERS WHICH SHOWS SOME OF HER FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF HER NEW LIFE
IF YOUR MOTHER IS MORE COMPOSED WHEN YOU ARE WITH HER STAY WITH HER
OF THE FOOD AND GENERAL TREATMENT IN TERMS OF APPROVAL
AND HER STRONG IMPERIOUS WILL WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN DAUNTED BY OPPOSITION OR DIFFICULTY
ALAS
ALAS
YOU WOULD BE ASTONISHED WHAT A SENSIBLE CLEVER LETTER SHE WRITES
NOW DON'T BE STARTLED AT THE NAMES OF SHAKSPEARE AND BYRON
CHARLOTTE THEN SPOKE
BUT HERE AGAIN IT WAS DOUBTFUL WHETHER WITHOUT MORE INSTRUCTION THEY COULD ENGAGE TO GIVE LESSONS IN IT
I AM NO BETTER THAN EVER I WAS
YOU KNOW YOUR LETTERS ARE VALUED
THE READER MAY SAY THAT I HAVE MENTIONED HIS TENDENCY TO INTEMPERANCE LONG BEFORE
I LONG TO TRAVEL
THE PRINCIPAL OF THESE CAUSES WAS THE FOOD
I SHALL NOT LEAVE MY PRESENT SITUATION TILL MY FUTURE PROSPECTS ASSUME A MORE FIXED AND DEFINITE ASPECT A FORTNIGHT AFTERWARDS WE SEE THAT THE SEED HAS BEEN SOWN WHICH WAS TO GROW UP INTO A PLAN MATERIALLY INFLUENCING HER FUTURE LIFE
AND WHERE OFTEN ON AUTUMNAL OR WINTER NIGHTS THE FOUR WINDS OF HEAVEN SEEMED TO MEET AND RAGE TOGETHER TEARING ROUND THE HOUSE AS IF THEY WERE WILD BEASTS STRIVING TO FIND AN ENTRANCE
IL CROISAIT SES BRAS NERVEUX SUR SA LARGE POITRINE ET SEUL DEBOUT SUR SON SEUIL IL ATTENDAIT IL BRAVAIT CETTE TEMPETE POPULAIRE DONT LES FLOTS VENAIENT MOURIR A QUELQUES PAS DE LUI
THE DAY DREAMS IN WHICH YOU HABITUALLY INDULGE ARE LIKELY TO INDUCE A DISTEMPERED STATE OF MIND
THE MAGNIFICENCE OF LONDON HAS DRAWN EXCLAMATIONS OF ASTONISHMENT FROM TRAVELLED MEN EXPERIENCED IN THE WORLD ITS WONDERS AND BEAUTIES
29TH 1841
THIS MILL IS NOW DESTROYED
HE IS EXPECTED TO ACT A PART IN LIFE
HE WHOSE BALL BROUGHT DOWN THE MARK HELD THE PROUD TITLE OF CAPTAIN OF THE POPINJAY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY AND WAS USUALLY ESCORTED IN TRIUMPH TO THE MOST RESPECTABLE CHANGE-HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE THE EVENING WAS CLOSED WITH CONVIVIALITY CONDUCTED UNDER HIS AUSPICES AND IF HE WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN IT AT HIS EXPENSE."--OLD MORTALITY
THE PICTURE WAS DIVIDED ALMOST IN THE MIDDLE BY A GREAT PILLAR
HER HEALTH BECAME MUCH SHAKEN
IN THE SPRING OF IT MARIA BECAME SO RAPIDLY WORSE THAT MR BRONTE WAS SENT FOR
M

M
21
IN HIS PREACHING HE WAS OCCASIONALLY ASSISTED BY WESLEY AND WHITFIELD AND AT SUCH TIMES THE LITTLE CHURCH PROVED MUCH TOO SMALL TO HOLD THE THRONG THAT POURED IN FROM DISTANT VILLAGES OR LONELY MOORLAND HAMLETS
IT IS FAR FROM HOME C
A HOWLING RAINY AUTUMN EVENING TOO--WHEN CERTAIN WHO HAD THAT DAY PERFORMED A PILGRIMAGE TO A GRAVE NEW MADE IN A HERETIC CEMETERY SAT NEAR A WOOD FIRE ON THE HEARTH OF A FOREIGN DWELLING
SON CARACTERE EGALE EN GRANDEUR ET SURPASSE EN VERITE CELUI DE TOUT AUTRE HEROS ANCIEN OU MODERNE
AND CHARLOTTE WAS NATURALLY DRIVEN TO CRITICISE BOOKS
QUAND LE CORPS EST PARESSEUX L'ESPRIT SOUFFRE CRUELLEMENT
I HAVE HAD A CURIOUS PACKET CONFIDED TO ME CONTAINING AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF MANUSCRIPT IN AN INCONCEIVABLY SMALL SPACE
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER TO JUDGE FOR MYSELF OF THE STATE OF HER HEALTH
TO MY EAR THEY HAD ALSO A PECULIAR MUSIC WILD MELANCHOLY AND ELEVATING
FOR THREE DAYS LATER SHE WROTE THE FOLLOWING THE MESSRS
AT THE SAME TIME HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOUND HIS STRONG LOVE OF PLEASURE AND IRREGULAR HABITS A GREAT IMPEDIMENT IN HIS PATH TO FAME
STILL HE IS NEVER PEEVISH
CHAPTER VI THIS IS PERHAPS A FITTING TIME TO GIVE SOME PERSONAL DESCRIPTION OF MISS BRONTE
SHE NEVER LOST A MOMENT OF TIME AND SEEMED ALMOST TO GRUDGE THE NECESSARY LEISURE FOR RELAXATION AND PLAY-HOURS WHICH MIGHT BE PARTLY ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE AWKWARDNESS IN ALL GAMES OCCASIONED BY HER SHORTNESS OF SIGHT
IT IS CLEVER AND IN WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT CATHOLICISM VERY GOOD
WE ARE GLAD THAT WE HAVE MADE THE ATTEMPT AND WE WILL NOT BE CAST DOWN BECAUSE IT HAS NOT SUCCEEDED THERE WERE PROBABLY GROWING UP IN EACH SISTER'S HEART SECRET UNACKNOWLEDGED FEELINGS OF RELIEF THAT THEIR PLAN HAD NOT SUCCEEDED
THE POOR ARE BORN TO LABOUR AND THE DEPENDENT TO ENDURE I RESOLVED TO BE PATIENT TO COMMAND MY FEELINGS AND TO TAKE WHAT CAME
INDEED IN HER POSITION NOTHING LESS THAN ENTIRE CONSTANT ABSORPTION IN PETTY MONEY MATTERS COULD HAVE SCRAPED TOGETHER A PROVISION
HIS DWELLING WAS NEAR THE FACTORY
EMILY HAD GONE AS TEACHER TO A SCHOOL AT HALIFAX WHERE THERE WERE NEARLY FORTY PUPILS
I AM SURE ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION PERHAPS OF MARY WERE VERY GLAD WHEN I TOOK MY DEPARTURE
THIS AGAIN WOULD REQUIRE ADVANTAGES ON THEIR PART WHICH THEY DID NOT AT PRESENT POSSESS BUT WHICH CHARLOTTE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF
AN ESTRANGEMENT OF WHICH PERHAPS THE FORMER WAS HARDLY AWARE
CHARLOTTE AND EMILY SUFFERED ACUTELY FROM HIS MYSTERIOUS BEHAVIOUR
PAPA WAS GREATLY HORRIFIED ALSO BUT I DON'T REGRET IT ON HER RETURN FROM THIS SHORT VISIT TO HER FRIEND SHE TRAVELLED WITH A GENTLEMAN IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE WHOSE FEATURES AND BEARING BETRAYED HIM IN A MOMENT TO BE A FRENCHMAN
I AM TOO OLD FOR THAT NOW
SHE SAID SADLY YES
I WAS STRUCK WITH THE NOTE YOU SENT ME WITH THE UMBRELLA
LITTLE ANNE AGED SCARCELY EIGHT PICKS OUT THE POLITICIANS OF THE DAY FOR HER CHIEF MEN
YOU DENIED YOURSELF ALL PLEASURE ALMOST ALL RELAXATION IN YOUR YOUTH AND IN THE PRIME OF LIFE
BUT MRS B
I DO WANT TO SEE YOU AND TALK TO YOU AND BE WITH YOU
DON'T LAUGH AT MY SIMILE
TO LEND HER BOOKS
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SEND COPIES AND ADVERTISEMENTS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE TO EACH OF THE UNDERMENTIONED PERIODICALS
HE KEPT A LARGE BOYS SCHOOL
IT WAS AN OLD GEOGRAPHY-BOOK
LA CARRIERE D'UN SOLDAT PARVENU DES CHAMPS DE BATAILLE UNE MER DE SANG UN TRONE PUIS DU SANG ENCORE ET DES FERS
IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME I TOLD HER SHE WAS VERY UGLY
J'ESPERE QUE VOUS ME PARDONNEREZ MONSIEUR DE PROFITER DE CETTE CIRCONSTANCE POUR VOUS FAIRE PARVENIR L'EXPRESSION DE MON RESPECT
THIS NEW PART WAS DEVOTED EXPRESSLY TO SCHOOLROOMS DORMITORIES C
AND BETWEEN EVERY DRENCHING THE QUESTION WAS PUT TO HIM WILL YOU PROMISE NOT TO COME AFTER BETTY AGAIN FOR A LONG TIME RICHARD BRAVELY REFUSED TO GIVE IN
AT LEAST I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS MY EARNEST CONVICTION ON THE SUBJECT
AND AS I HAVE MENTIONED IT WAS IN THESE PERILOUS TIMES THAT HE BEGAN HIS CUSTOM OF CARRYING A LOADED PISTOL CONTINUALLY ABOUT WITH HIM
NEVERTHELESS THIS YOUNG LADY SUSPECTED THAT THE SISTERS WROTE FOR MAGAZINES
BUT HAWORTH VILLAGE WAS WILD AND LONELY AND THE BRONTES BUT LITTLE KNOWN OWING TO THEIR WANT OF CONNECTIONS
SHE ABOUNDED IN STRONG PRACTICAL SENSE AND SHREWDNESS
I SUPPOSE THAT WOULD SHOCK SOME PEOPLE BUT I SHOULD I THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE AS MUCH FEELING AS A NURSE AS MOST PEOPLE AND MORE THAN SOME
THEY HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT THEY USED TO CARE FOR
BRANWELL EXPECTED TO HAVE A SHORT LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM HIS EMPLOYMENT AS A CLERK ON THE LEEDS AND MANCHESTER RAILWAY IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED FOR FIVE MONTHS
SHE RULED THE CHILDREN PRETTY SHARPLY
AND DEPEND UPON IT 50_L OR 100_L THUS LAID OUT WOULD BE WELL EMPLOYED
AS OTHERWISE SINCE SHE HAS NOT THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING PERIODICALS REGULARLY SHE MAY MISS READING THE CRITIQUE
AND THOUGH HE WAS THE LAST MAN IN THE WORLD TO CONCEAL HIS OPINIONS HE LIVED IN PERFECT AMITY WITH ALL THE RESPECTABLE PART OF THOSE WHO DIFFERED FROM HIM
INFANS
I CAN ONLY SAY ADHERE TO STANDARD AUTHORS AND AVOID NOVELTY FROM THIS LIST WE SEE THAT SHE MUST HAVE HAD A GOOD RANGE OF BOOKS FROM WHICH TO CHOOSE HER OWN READING
ROBIN
THEY ARE TO DO AS THEY LIKE
THE ORIGIN OF THE CUSTOM HAD BEEN THE NECESSITY OF FURNISHING SOME REFRESHMENT FOR THOSE WHO CAME FROM A DISTANCE TO PAY THE LAST MARK OF RESPECT TO A FRIEND
NOR WAS HOSPITALITY ONE OF THE MAIN VIRTUES OF YORKSHIRE WANTING
WHAT COULD SHE DO TO NURSE AND CHERISH UP THIS LITTLE SISTER THE YOUNGEST OF THEM ALL
BUT JESSY I WILL WRITE ABOUT YOU NO MORE
MISS BRANWELL WAS EXTREMELY SMALL IN PERSON
I HAVE BOTHERED YOU BOTH--YOU ESPECIALLY
ONE OF THE TWO CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN THUS STOWED AWAY USED TO POINT OUT WITH PRIDE AFTER SHE HAD GROWN UP TO WOMAN'S ESTATE THE MARKS OF MUSKET SHOT AND THE TRACES OF GUNPOWDER ON THE WALLS OF HER FATHER'S MILL
WE DO NOT CARE HOW MODEST HOW HUMBLE OUR COMMENCEMENT BE SO IT BE MADE ON SURE GROUNDS AND HAVE A SAFE FOUNDATION
THE THIRD TO A PEWTERER OR WATCHMAKER
IN SUCH A VENTURE
BESIDES CHARLOTTE'S EARNEST VIGOROUS MIND SAW AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY AGE THE IMMENSE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION AS FURNISHING HER WITH TOOLS WHICH SHE HAD THE STRENGTH AND THE WILL TO WIELD AND SHE WOULD BE AWARE THAT THE COWAN BRIDGE EDUCATION WAS IN MANY POINTS THE BEST THAT HER FATHER COULD PROVIDE FOR HER
HIS FATHER HUGH BRONTE WAS LEFT AN ORPHAN AT AN EARLY AGE
TELL ME ONLY WHEN I MUST COME
IT WAS A QUEER SORT OF COLDNESS WHEN I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY EARS TO SAY YES AND WAS OBLIGED TO SAY NO
BESIDES RECEIVING ANOTHER BAD CUT IN THE ARM HE HAD COMPLETELY LAID OPEN THE ARTERY AND WAS IN A FAIR WAY OF BLEEDING TO DEATH--WHICH ONE OF HIS RELATIONS COMFORTED HIM BY SAYING WOULD BE LIKELY TO SAVE A DEAL O TROUBLE WHEN MY HUSBAND HAD CHECKED THE EFFUSION OF BLOOD WITH A STRAP THAT ONE OF THE BYSTANDERS UNBUCKLED FROM HIS LEG HE ASKED IF A SURGEON HAD BEEN SENT FOR
SHE SAID MY YOUTH IS LEAVING ME
THERE WAS ANOTHER TRIAL OF HEALTH COMMON TO ALL THE GIRLS
BUT HER SCHOOL-FELLOWS WERE MORE THAN SORRY--THEY WERE INDIGNANT
AND THEN HE DREADS THE STATE OF DEPENDENCE TO WHICH BLINDNESS WILL INEVITABLY REDUCE HIM
THEY PREPARED THEIR FRENCH DRAWING GERMAN AND LITERATURE FOR THEIR VARIOUS MASTERS
NO DOUBT WHATEVER CAN BE ENTERTAINED OF THE DEEP INTEREST WHICH HE FELT IN THE SUCCESS OF THE SCHOOL
THE CHILDREN ARE OVER-INDULGED AND CONSEQUENTLY HARD AT TIMES TO MANAGE
THE LATTER WORK STRONGLY ATTRACTED AND STRANGELY FASCINATED MY ATTENTION
AND WHILE HE IS HERE YOU SHALL NOT COME
FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR SO THEY WERE AGAIN TO BE ALL THREE APART
NEAR TO IT IS LADY ANNE'S WELL
I WILL NOW COPY OUT ANOTHER WRITTEN NEARLY A YEAR LATER DURING WHICH THE PROGRESS MADE APPEARS TO ME VERY GREAT
AND BRANWELL IS STANDING BEFORE HER LAUGHING AT HER VIVACITY CHARLOTTE GREW MUCH STRONGER IN THIS QUIET HAPPY PERIOD AT HOME
I FELT A PAINFUL HEAT RISE TO MY FACE WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE QUIRES OF PAPER I HAD COVERED WITH WHAT ONCE GAVE ME SO MUCH DELIGHT BUT WHICH NOW WAS ONLY A SOURCE OF CONFUSION
OF THESE THERE WERE MANY IN DIFFERENT PLIGHTS AND ACCORDING TO THEIR PLIGHT KEPT IN DIFFERENT PLACES
WHAT COULD THEY DO
MARY'S PRICE IS ABOVE RUBIES
IT IS NOT MY ADVICE THAT YOU HAVE ASKED AS TO THE DIRECTION OF YOUR TALENTS BUT MY OPINION OF THEM AND YET THE OPINION MAY BE WORTH LITTLE AND THE ADVICE MUCH
C WERE FAMILIAR AS HOUSEHOLD WORDS
IN ITS FULFILMENT AT LAST IT WAS A FAVOURABLE SPECIMEN OF MANY A SIMILAR AIR-BUBBLE DANCING BEFORE HER EYES IN HER BRIEF CAREER IN WHICH STERN REALITIES RATHER THAN PLEASURES FORMED THE LEADING INCIDENTS
THERE WERE ALSO SOME SHOPKEEPERS FOR THE HUMBLER AND EVERYDAY WANTS
YET I CANNOT YET PERMIT MYSELF TO ENTER UPON LIFE--TO TOUCH THE OBJECT WHICH SEEMS NOW WITHIN MY REACH AND WHICH I HAVE BEEN SO LONG STRAINING TO ATTAIN
CHARLOTTE'S OF SOLICITUDE
WITH WHAT EAGERNESS PAPA TORE OFF THE COVER AND HOW WE ALL GATHERED ROUND HIM AND WITH WHAT BREATHLESS ANXIETY WE LISTENED AS ONE BY ONE THEY WERE DISCLOSED AND EXPLAINED AND ARGUED UPON SO ABLY AND SO WELL
I THEN WANDER ABOUT FROM ROOM TO ROOM BUT THE SILENCE AND LONELINESS OF ALL THE HOUSE WEIGHS DOWN ONE'S SPIRITS LIKE LEAD
MEN HARDLY PAST MIDDLE LIFE TALK OF THE DAYS OF THEIR YOUTH SPENT IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WHEN DURING THE WINTER MONTHS THEY RODE UP TO THE SADDLE-GIRTHS IN MUD
SO IF EVERYTHING ELSE FAILS I CAN TURN MY HAND TO THAT IF ANYBODY WILL GIVE ME GOOD WAGES FOR LITTLE LABOUR
INDEED EVER SINCE THEY CAME TO HAWORTH IN 1819
HE TOLD ME THAT ONE DAY THIS SUMMER WHEN THE BRONTES HAD BEEN FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS RECEIVING INSTRUCTION FROM HIM HE READ TO THEM VICTOR HUGO'S CELEBRATED PORTRAIT OF MIRABEAU MAIS DANS MA LECON JE ME BORNAIS A CE QUI CONCERNE MIRABEAU ORATEUR
NEITHER OF MY INFORMANTS WAS HOWEVER PRESENT AT THESE EDIFYING SERVICES
THEY RESISTED THEREFORE WITH ENERGY THAT WHICH THEY DEEMED TO BE OPPRESSION AND INJUSTICE
AND AS YOU WOULD HOLD A LIGHT TO ONE IN UTTER DARKNESS--AS YOU VALUE YOUR OWN KINDHEARTEDNESS--_RETURN ME AN ANSWER IF BUT ONE WORD TELLING ME WHETHER I SHOULD WRITE ON OR WRITE NO MORE
I SAID IN MY LAST LETTER THAT MRS
IT STOLE INTO LIFE
MARY CAST OIL UPON THE FLAMES--ENCOURAGED ME AND IN HER OWN STRONG ENERGETIC LANGUAGE HEARTENED ME ON
IS NOT YET COME TO HAWORTH
THIS WORD EXCUSE IMPLIES CONFESSION OF A FAULT AND I DO NOT FEEL THAT I HAVE BEEN IN FAULT
BUT A FIRE WAS KINDLED IN MY VERY HEART WHICH I COULD NOT QUENCH
BUT HER LETTERS ARE NOT THE LETTERS OF A PERSON IN THE ENJOYMENT OF GREAT HAPPINESS
HER POOR FATHER NEARLY SIGHTLESS DEPENDED UPON HER CARES IN HIS BLIND HELPLESSNESS
AND IT LIKEWISE PROCURED HIM THE UNDESIRABLE DISTINCTION OF HAVING HIS COMPANY RECOMMENDED BY THE LANDLORD OF THE BLACK BULL TO ANY CHANCE TRAVELLER WHO MIGHT HAPPEN TO FEEL SOLITARY OR DULL OVER HIS LIQUOR
IT RISES DARK FROM THE STONY ENCLOSURE OF ITS GRAVEYARD
AS IT IS I WILL ONLY ASK YOU TO IMAGINE THE MISERIES OF A RESERVED WRETCH LIKE ME THROWN AT ONCE INTO THE MIDST OF A LARGE FAMILY AT A TIME WHEN THEY WERE PARTICULARLY GAY--WHEN THE HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH COMPANY--ALL STRANGERS--PEOPLE WHOSE FACES I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
HER CALLING TO A STRANGE DOG RUNNING PAST WITH HANGING HEAD AND LOLLING TONGUE TO GIVE IT A MERCIFUL DRAUGHT OF WATER ITS MADDENED SNAP AT HER HER NOBLY STERN PRESENCE OF MIND GOING RIGHT INTO THE KITCHEN AND TAKING UP ONE OF TABBY'S RED-HOT ITALIAN IRONS TO SEAR THE BITTEN PLACE AND TELLING NO ONE TILL THE DANGER WAS WELL-NIGH OVER FOR FEAR OF THE TERRORS THAT MIGHT BESET THEIR WEAKER MINDS
HIS COMPANY ARE TIMOTHY TICKLER MORGAN O'DOHERTY MACRABIN MORDECAI MULLION WARNELL AND JAMES HOGG A MAN OF MOST EXTRAORDINARY GENIUS A SCOTTISH SHEPHERD
NOW CAN YOU TELL ME WHETHER IT IS CONSIDERED IMPROPER FOR GOVERNESSES TO ASK THEIR FRIENDS TO COME AND SEE THEM
YOU WORKED HARD
SHE STILL KEPT UP HER CHILDISH INTEREST IN POLITICS
ALTOGETHER HE WAS AN UNPOPULAR MAN EVEN BEFORE HE TOOK THE LAST STEP OF EMPLOYING SHEARS INSTEAD OF HANDS TO DRESS HIS WOOL
BRUSSELS 1842 MAY I WAS TWENTY-SIX YEARS OLD A WEEK OR TWO SINCE
THIS APPEARS STRANGE CONDUCT TO A FRIEND NEAR AND DEAR LONG-KNOWN AND NEVER FOUND WANTING
LET US SOMEHOW HOPE IN HALF RED INDIAN CREED THAT HE FOLLOWS EMILY NOW
I MAY ADD A LITTLE ANECDOTE AS A TESTIMONY TO THE ADMIRABLE CHARACTER OF THE LIKENESS OF MISS BRONTE PREFIXED TO THIS VOLUME
IT WAS HER OWN WISH THAT SHE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO GO ALONE AS SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD MANAGE BETTER AND SUMMON MORE COURAGE IF THROWN ENTIRELY UPON HER OWN RESOURCES
AND THE GREATER HER MERIT
BUT POOR CHARLOTTE RECEIVED THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WITH SO SAD A FIT OF CRYING THAT MISS W---'S KIND HEART WAS SOFTENED AND SHE WISELY PERCEIVED THAT WITH SUCH A GIRL IT WOULD BE BETTER TO PLACE HER IN THE FIRST CLASS AND ALLOW HER TO MAKE UP BY PRIVATE STUDY IN THOSE BRANCHES WHERE SHE WAS DEFICIENT
IT STANDS IN A PASTURE-FIELD ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE HIGH ROAD
IF ON THE OTHER HAND THEY SHOULD PASS UNNOTICED OR BE CONDEMNED I CONSIDER IT WOULD BE QUITE USELESS TO ADVERTISE AS THERE IS NOTHING EITHER IN THE TITLE OF THE WORK OR THE NAMES OF THE AUTHORS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION FROM A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL I SUPPOSE THE LITTLE VOLUME OF POEMS WAS PUBLISHED SOME TIME ABOUT THE END OF MAY 1846
WHILE CARLYLE REGARDED HIM AS A CHARACTER REGULATED BY A STRONG AND CONSCIENTIOUS DESIRE TO DO THE WILL OF THE LORD
IN THE BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF HER SISTERS WHICH CHARLOTTE PREFIXED TO THE EDITION OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS AND AGNES GREY PUBLISHED IN 1850--A PIECE OF WRITING UNIQUE AS FAR AS I KNOW IN ITS PATHOS AND ITS POWER--SHE SAYS ONE DAY IN THE AUTUMN OF 1845 I ACCIDENTALLY LIGHTED ON A MS
THEY SPEAK OF HER AS THEIR FAVOURITE AUNT AND ONE TO WHOM THEY AS WELL AS ALL THE FAMILY LOOKED UP AS A PERSON OF TALENT AND GREAT AMIABILITY OF DISPOSITION AND AGAIN AS MEEK AND RETIRING WHILE POSSESSING MORE THAN ORDINARY TALENTS WHICH SHE INHERITED FROM HER FATHER AND HER PIETY WAS GENUINE AND UNOBTRUSIVE MR BRONTE REMAINED FOR FIVE YEARS AT HARTSHEAD IN THE PARISH OF DEWSBURY
BUT THEY BEGAN GLORIFYING THEMSELVES AND ABUSING DISSENTERS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT MY TEMPER LOST ITS BALANCE AND I PRONOUNCED A FEW SENTENCES SHARPLY AND RAPIDLY WHICH STRUCK THEM ALL DUMB
OF COURSE HE WAS CAREFUL ENOUGH NOT TO REVEAL ANYTHING BEFORE HIS FATHER AND SISTERS OF THE PLEASURES HE INDULGED IN
SHE APPEARS TO HAVE FORMED HER NOTIONS OF ITS PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES FROM SOME OF THE PAPERS IN THE BRITISH ESSAYISTS THE RAMBLER THE MIRROR OR THE LOUNGER WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN AMONG THE ENGLISH CLASSICS ON THE PARSONAGE BOOKSHELVES
HAWORTH FEBRUARY 20TH 1834
IN THE REST THERE ARE TOUCHES REMINDING ONE OF JULIET'S BUT TRUST ME GENTLEMAN I'LL PROVE MORE TRUE THAN THOSE THAT HAVE MORE CUNNING TO BE STRANGE THERE ARE PLANS FOR HAPPY PIC-NIC PARTIES TO KIRKSTALL ABBEY IN THE GLOWING SEPTEMBER DAYS WHEN UNCLE AUNT AND COUSIN JANE,"--THE LAST ENGAGED TO A MR MORGAN ANOTHER CLERGYMAN--WERE OF THE PARTY
FOR DIVINITY YOUR BROTHER WILL ADVISE YOU THERE
HEGER TOLD THEM THAT HE MEANT TO DISPENSE WITH THE OLD METHOD OF GROUNDING IN GRAMMAR VOCABULARY C AND TO PROCEED ON A NEW PLAN--SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT HE HAD OCCASIONALLY ADOPTED WITH THE ELDER AMONG HIS FRENCH AND BELGIAN PUPILS
ON THE CONTRARY I KNOW MY PLACE IS A FAVOURABLE ONE FOR A GOVERNESS
BRANWELL WAS RATHER A HANDSOME BOY WITH TAWNY HAIR TO USE MISS BRONTE'S PHRASE FOR A MORE OBNOXIOUS COLOUR
EMILY SPOKE FIRST
FROM RARELY REQUIRING THE ASSISTANCE OF OTHERS HE COMES TO DOUBT THE POWER OF BESTOWING IT
I MAY NOW SAY A LITTLE ON THE CHARACTER OF THE DISSENTING POPULATION IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING ROE HEAD
THEY HAD CROPPED HAIR AND A MORE GIRLISH DRESS
SANS DOUTE IL EST VRAI QUE LA JEUNESSE DE PIERRE ETAIT FET TROUBLEE PAR PASSIONS ORAGEUSES
CHRISTMAS TOO WAS THEN A SEASON OF PECULIAR INDULGENCE AND CONVIVIALITY AND A ROUND OF ENTERTAINMENTS WAS GIVEN CONSISTING OF TEA AND SUPPER
AND I THINK TOO THAT THE MODE OF BRINGING THEM UP IS STRANGE
INSIDE THE CHARACTER OF THE PILLARS SHOWS THAT THEY WERE CONSTRUCTED BEFORE THE REIGN OF HENRY VII
EACH HAD THEIR OWN STRONG CHARACTERISTIC FLAVOUR
BUT AS A NOMINEE OF THE VICAR HE WOULD NOT BE RECEIVED
BUT I CAN'T GET LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR LONGER THAN A WEEK AND I'M AFRAID THAT WOULD NOT SUIT YOU--MUST I THEN GIVE IT UP ENTIRELY
IN YOUR LAST YOU REQUEST ME TO TELL YOU OF YOUR FAULTS
SHE USED TO GO AND STAND UNDER THE TREES IN THE PLAY-GROUND AND SAY IT WAS PLEASANTER
SHE MADE POETRY AND DRAWING AT LEAST EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING TO ME
ON THE DECEASE OF MR CHARNOCK THE VICAR FIRST TENDERED THE PREFERMENT TO MR BRONTE AND HE WENT OVER TO HIS EXPECTED CURE
HAVE I SAID ENOUGH TO CLEAR MYSELF OF SO SILLY AN IMPUTATION
NOR HAD THEY ANY COPY OR MEMORANDUM OF THE CORRESPONDENCE
THE GIRLS TOOK THEIR COLD DINNER WITH THEM AND ATE IT BETWEEN THE SERVICES IN A CHAMBER OVER THE ENTRANCE OPENING OUT OF THE FORMER GALLERIES
WE ARE ALL OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR KIND SUGGESTION ABOUT LEEDS
I MUST HAVE SOME MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE THAN RESPECT FOR MY MASTER AND MISTRESS GRATITUDE FOR THEIR KINDNESS C TO INDUCE ME TO REFUSE A SALARY OF 50_L
IN THE VILLAGE OF HECKMONDWIKE AT ONE END OF WHICH ROE HEAD IS SITUATED THERE WERE TWO LARGE CHAPELS BELONGING TO THAT DENOMINATION AND ONE TO THE METHODISTS ALL OF WHICH WERE WELL FILLED TWO OR THREE TIMES ON A SUNDAY BESIDES HAVING VARIOUS PRAYER-MEETINGS FULLY ATTENDED ON WEEK DAYS
BUT THIS WINTER OF 1833-4 WAS PARTICULARLY WET AND RAINY AND THERE WERE AN UNUSUAL NUMBER OF DEATHS IN THE VILLAGE
IN ONE OF HER LETTERS REFERENCE HAS BEEN MADE TO MRS JENKINS THE WIFE OF THE CHAPLAIN OF THE BRITISH EMBASSY
I SHALL MAKE ONE OR TWO EXTRACTS FROM THEM TO SHOW WHAT SORT OF A PERSON WAS THE MOTHER OF CHARLOTTE BRONTE
IN MANY INSTANCES THE PERSON IS DESIGNATED BY HIS RESIDENCE
AND--MUST HAVE AS WEARY AND BURDENSOME A LIFE OF IT IN WAITING UPON THEIR UNHAPPY BROTHER
MY AUNT WAS ONE OF THEM
DO DO DO COME AND SEE ME
IT MUST NOT BE AND IN A THOUSAND WAYS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THAT MORTIFIES AND DISAPPOINTS ME MOST KEENLY AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS DISAPPOINTED
MR ROBERSON HAD PLENTY OF WARLIKE SPIRIT IN HIM MAN OF PEACE THOUGH HE WAS
THEIR FEELINGS ARE NOT EASILY ROUSED BUT THEIR DURATION IS LASTING
MARIE-LOUISE N'EST PAS LA FEMME DE NAPOLEON
THIS VERY NIGHT I WILL PRAY AS YOU WISH ME
PAPA INDEED WOULD WILLINGLY INDULGE ME BUT THIS VERY KINDNESS OF HIS MAKES ME DOUBT WHETHER I OUGHT TO DRAW UPON IT
I FEAR SHE CAN NEVER STAND IT WHEN THE SISTERS MET AT HOME IN THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS THEY TALKED OVER THEIR LIVES AND THE PROSPECT WHICH THEY AFFORDED OF EMPLOYMENT AND REMUNERATION
I KNOW MY OWN SENTIMENTS I CAN READ MY OWN MIND BUT THE MINDS OF THE REST OF MAN AND WOMAN KIND ARE TO ME SEALED VOLUMES HIEROGLYPHICAL SCROLLS WHICH I CANNOT EASILY EITHER UNSEAL OR DECIPHER
REQUIRED HER GOVERNESS TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS IN MUSIC AND SINGING FOR WHICH CHARLOTTE WAS NOT QUALIFIED
AND CAN IT BE WONDERED AT THAT AS HE SEES THE MOST PRECIOUS OF HIS FACULTIES LEAVING HIM HIS SPIRITS SOMETIMES SINK
I AM NOT GROWN A BIT BUT AS SHORT AND DUMPY AS EVER
THE IDEA OF THE MISTRESS AND HER MAIDENS SPINNING AT THE GREAT WHEELS WHILE THE MASTER WAS ABROAD PLOUGHING HIS FIELDS OR SEEING AFTER HIS FLOCKS ON THE PURPLE MOORS IS VERY POETICAL TO LOOK BACK UPON
THE BELGIANS LIKED HER VERY WELL ON THE WHOLE
THEY ARE A POWERFUL RACE BOTH IN MIND AND BODY BOTH FOR GOOD AND FOR EVIL
THIS IS THE EPITOME OF HER LIFE
THIS CRAVING TO SEE AND KNOW LONDON AND THAT STRONGER CRAVING AFTER FAME WERE NEVER TO BE SATISFIED
TO BE SURE MY OPINION WILL GO BUT A VERY LITTLE WAY TO DECIDE HIS CHARACTER
SO HE BEGAN THE HABIT WHICH HAS CONTINUED TO THIS DAY OF INVARIABLY CARRYING A LOADED PISTOL ABOUT WITH HIM
LES DEUX POINTS EXTREMES TOUCHENT LA TERRE LA COMBLE LUMI-NEUSE MESURE LES CIEUX
AND HAD ATTACHED HERSELF VERY STRONGLY TO THE LATTER WHO IN RETURN BESTOWED UPON HER MUCH QUIET AFFECTION
AND AT THE END WAS THE ESTRADE OR PLATFORM FOR THE PRESIDING INSTRUCTOR
AND THEN I AM NOT TO BE WITH A SET OF PEOPLE WITH WHOM I HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON--WHO WOULD BE NUISANCES AND BORES
IS PAPA WELL
WHICH SHE ACCORDINGLY DID
THIS ANXIETY WEIGHED UPON THEIR MINDS RATHER HEAVILY DURING THE MONTHS OF DARK AND DREARY WEATHER
EXPRESSED GREAT REGRET WHEN ONE OF MISS BRONTE'S FRIENDS DROVE UP TO THE HOUSE TO LEAVE A LETTER OR PARCEL WITHOUT ENTERING
THIS TIME SHE WENT AS A PUPIL TO MISS W WHO LIVED AT ROE HEAD A CHEERFUL ROOMY COUNTRY HOUSE STANDING A LITTLE APART IN A FIELD ON THE RIGHT OF THE ROAD FROM LEEDS TO HUDDERSFIELD
THE PROJECT IS YET IN ITS INFANCY HARDLY PEEPING FROM ITS SHELL
AFTER NEARLY FOUR YEARS RESIDENCE HE OBTAINED HIS B.A
I ALWAYS WAS A LUCKY FELLOW THESE MEN ARE KEEN AND SHREWD
I WROTE TO HER URGING HER TO GO HOME OR ELSEWHERE
WITH SOFT THICK BROWN HAIR AND PECULIAR EYES OF WHICH I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GIVE A DESCRIPTION AS THEY APPEARED TO ME IN HER LATER LIFE
AT FIVE O'CLOCK BREAD AND MILK FOR THE YOUNGER ONES
CHARLOTTE CRIED BITTERLY
I AM INCLINED TO THINK TOO THAT THEY HAD NOT THE HAPPY KNACK OF IMPARTING INFORMATION WHICH SEEMS TO BE A SEPARATE GIFT FROM THE FACULTY OF ACQUIRING IT
THE PRINCIPAL BEDROOM WAS OVER THE LONG CLASSE OR SCHOOLROOM
I DOUBT WHETHER CHARLOTTE COULD PLAY AT ALL
SHE WAS SURPRISED AND TOUCHED BY ANY SIGN OF THOUGHTFULNESS FOR OTHERS OF KINDNESS TO ANIMALS OR OF UNSELFISHNESS ON THEIR PART
AND ONCE WHEN A BOY HAD RUN AWAY HOME HE FOLLOWED HIM ON HORSEBACK RECLAIMED HIM FROM HIS PARENTS AND TYING HIM BY A ROPE TO THE STIRRUP OF HIS SADDLE MADE HIM RUN ALONGSIDE OF HIS HORSE FOR THE MANY MILES THEY HAD TO TRAVERSE BEFORE REACHING HEALD'S HALL
THERE IS AN INTELLIGENT MAN LIVING IN HAWORTH WHO HAS GIVEN ME SOME INTERESTING PARTICULARS RELATING TO THE SISTERS ABOUT THIS PERIOD
SHE IS IN NO WAYS CRUSHED BY THE EVENT
THROUGH SOME OPENING BETWEEN THE HOUSES THOSE ON THE HORSES SAW MR REDHEAD AND HIS FRIENDS CREEPING ALONG BEHIND THE STREET
I DO NOT EXPECT THAT AUNT WILL SINK MORE THAN 150_L
IF NECESSARY HE WOULD SIT MOTIONLESS ON THEIR BACKS FOR HALF-AN-HOUR OR MORE TO BRING THEM TO
THE SCOOPS INTO WHICH THEY FALL ONLY REVEALING OTHER HILLS BEYOND OF SIMILAR COLOUR AND SHAPE CROWNED WITH WILD BLEAK MOORS--GRAND FROM THE IDEAS OF SOLITUDE AND LONELINESS WHICH THEY SUGGEST OR OPPRESSIVE FROM THE FEELING WHICH THEY GIVE OF BEING PENT-UP BY SOME MONOTONOUS AND ILLIMITABLE BARRIER ACCORDING TO THE MOOD OF MIND IN WHICH THE SPECTATOR MAY BE
HOWEVER WHEN SHE WAS LEFT IN THIS UNCEREMONIOUS MANNER SHE DETERMINED TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT
DO NOT URGE ME TO STAY MORE THAN TWO OR THREE DAYS BECAUSE I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO REFUSE YOU
I THINK OF EASTON VERY OFTEN AND OF WORTHY MR H AND HIS KIND-HEARTED HELPMATE AND OF OUR PLEASANT WALKS TO H WOOD AND TO BOYNTON OUR MERRY EVENINGS OUR ROMPS WITH LITTLE HANCHEON C C
AND CONSEQUENTLY THE WHOLE WORK OF THE HOUSE AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL DUTY OF NURSING TABBY FALLS ON OURSELVES
BUT THAT WAS WHEN THERE WERE NO MILLS IN THE VALLEYS
I HAVE TRIED THAT PLAN ONCE AND SUCCEEDED SO NOTABLY I SHALL TRY NO MORE
THIS WAS BAD ENOUGH BUT THE NEXT SUNDAY THE PROCEEDINGS WERE FAR WORSE
THERE WERE SIX OR EIGHT NARROW BEDS ON EACH SIDE OF THE APARTMENT EVERY ONE ENVELOPED IN ITS WHITE DRAPING CURTAIN
THERE IS NO EVENT WHATEVER TO MARK ITS PROGRESS
24TH 1848 AGED 31 YEARS
SHE WROTE THAT I HAD DONE HER A GREAT SERVICE THAT SHE SHOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW MY ADVICE AND WAS MUCH OBLIGED TO ME
BUT THE PLACE A SECRETARYSHIP TO A RAILWAY COMMITTEE IS GIVEN TO ANOTHER PERSON
WE SHALL SEE THE PROGRESS CHARLOTTE HAD MADE IN EASE AND GRACE OF STYLE A YEAR LATER
IL VOIT LE SAINT SEPULCRE LIBRE
I WON'T BE ANYTHING BUT A HOUSEMAID WITH REGARD TO MY VISIT TO G I HAVE AS YET RECEIVED NO INVITATION
DID I NOT ONCE SAY YOU OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL FOR YOUR INDEPENDENCE
THEN HOW COULD SHE BE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WAS LOSING HER DEAR AND NOBLE MARY FOR SUCH A LENGTH OF TIME AND DISTANCE OF SPACE THAT HER HEART MIGHT WELL PROPHESY THAT IT WAS FOR EVER
SHE HAD DIED IN THE NIGHT
AND THE STONE IS KEPT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN BY THE NOTABLE YORKSHIRE HOUSEWIVES
SO THE SICK CHILD BEGAN TO DRESS SHIVERING WITH COLD AS WITHOUT LEAVING HER BED SHE SLOWLY PUT ON HER BLACK WORSTED STOCKINGS OVER HER THIN WHITE LEGS MY INFORMANT SPOKE AS IF SHE SAW IT YET AND HER WHOLE FACE FLUSHED OUT UNDYING INDIGNATION JUST THEN MISS SCATCHERD ISSUED FROM HER ROOM AND WITHOUT ASKING FOR A WORD OF EXPLANATION FROM THE SICK AND FRIGHTENED GIRL SHE TOOK HER BY THE ARM ON THE SIDE TO WHICH THE BLISTER HAD BEEN APPLIED AND BY ONE VIGOROUS MOVEMENT WHIRLED HER OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR ABUSING HER ALL THE TIME FOR DIRTY AND UNTIDY HABITS
MADEMOISELLE MARIE IS TALENTED AND ORIGINAL BUT OF REPULSIVE AND ARBITRARY MANNERS WHICH HAVE MADE THE WHOLE SCHOOL EXCEPT MYSELF AND EMILY HER BITTER ENEMIES
I WON'T BE A NURSERYMAID NOR A LADY'S-MAID FAR LESS A LADY'S COMPANION OR A MANTUA-MAKER OR A STRAW-BONNET MAKER OR A TAKER-IN OF PLAIN WORK
SO MUCH FOR THE QUANTITY
SHE KNEW FROM BITTER EXPERIENCE THAT HIS VICES WERE UTTERLY HOPELESS
BRANWELL WAS WITH THEM
ALL WERE VERY CLEVER ORIGINAL AND UTTERLY DIFFERENT TO ANY PEOPLE OR FAMILY E HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE
ANNE LIKE HER ELDEST SISTER WAS SHY
FOREST CUSTOMS EXISTING IN THE FRINGES OF DARK WOOD WHICH CLOTHED THE DECLIVITY OF THE HILLS ON EITHER SIDE TENDED TO BRUTALIZE THE POPULATION UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
I HAVE LOTS OF CHEMISES NIGHTGOWNS POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS AND POCKETS TO MAKE
JAN
WELLESLEY
WELLESLEY
WELLESLEY
MEANWHILE THEY ENJOYED THEIR CHRISTMAS ALL TOGETHER INEXPRESSIBLY
THE SCHOOL-REBELLION
HE HAS WRITTEN TO ME THIS MORNING EXPRESSING SOME SENSE OF CONTRITION BUT AS LONG AS HE REMAINS AT HOME I SCARCE DARE HOPE FOR PEACE IN THE HOUSE
CHARLOTTE AND EMILY WERE TRYING TEACHING AND AS IT SEEMED WITHOUT MUCH SUCCESS
YET I HAD MANY LETTERS TO WRITE WHICH IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY SHOULD BE WRITTEN
MAIS LA PROVIDENCE PERMIT QU'UN HOMME SE TROUVAT QUI N'A JAMAIS SU CE QUE C'EST QUE LA CRAINTE
THE IDEA OF SEEING THE SEA--OF BEING NEAR IT--WATCHING ITS CHANGES BY SUNRISE SUNSET MOONLIGHT AND NOON-DAY--IN CALM PERHAPS IN STORM--FILLS AND SATISFIES MY MIND
I MUST NOT BOTHER YOU TOO MUCH WITH MY SORROWS OF WHICH I FEAR YOU HAVE HEARD AN EXAGGERATED ACCOUNT
AND DRUNKENNESS AND A LOW STATE OF MORALS WERE NATURALLY ASSOCIATED WITH IT
EMILY HARDLY EVER UTTERED MORE THAN A MONOSYLLABLE
THE OTHER WAS THE SCHOOLROOM
AS IT WAS WE SHALL SEE SHE MADE A GREAT AND SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO LEAVE HER TIMES IN HIS HANDS AFTER HER RETURN HOME SHE EMPLOYED HERSELF IN TEACHING HER SISTERS OVER WHOM SHE HAD HAD SUPERIOR ADVANTAGES
I OFTEN PLAN THE PLEASANT LIFE WHICH WE MIGHT LEAD TOGETHER STRENGTHENING EACH OTHER IN THAT POWER OF SELF-DENIAL THAT HALLOWED AND GLOWING DEVOTION WHICH THE FIRST SAINTS OF GOD OFTEN ATTAINED TO
AS HIS MORTAL DISEASE INCREASED AND IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO TURN SO AS TO FOLLOW THE COMBAT HE HAD LOOKING-GLASSES ARRANGED IN SUCH A MANNER AROUND AND ABOVE HIM AS HE LAY THAT HE COULD STILL SEE THE COCKS FIGHTING
THREE TIERS OF OLD-FASHIONED SEMICIRCULAR BOW WINDOWS RUN FROM BASEMENT TO ROOF
MARTHA IT APPEARS IS IN THE WAY OF ENJOYING GREAT ADVANTAGES
WHEN I SAY SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU WILL HARDLY HEAR ME
HER NERVES AND HER SPIRITS GAVE WAY
AND I COULD NOT PERSUADE HER THAT THEY WERE ONLY AVERAGE SPECIMENS OF WELL BROUGHT UP CHILDREN
AND THAT IT ANSWERED IS EVIDENT IN THE COMPOSITION OF SOME OF CHARLOTTE'S DEVOIRS WRITTEN ABOUT THIS TIME
SHE DIED A VERY FEW DAYS AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT HOME
IT WOULD STARTLE HIM TO SEE ME IN MY NATURAL HOME CHARACTER
AND THEY SEEM TO ME A SELF-SEEKING VAIN EMPTY RACE
AT THIS TIME THE YOUNG MAN SEEMED TO HAVE HIS FATE IN HIS OWN HANDS
SO WHERE HE REIGNS IN GLORY BRIGHT ABOVE THOSE STARRY SKIES OF NIGHT AMID HIS PARADISE OF LIGHT OH WHY MAY I NOT BE
I CANNOT SEW MUCH DURING THE DAY ON ACCOUNT OF THE CHILDREN WHO REQUIRE THE UTMOST ATTENTION
A LA VIE MILITAIRE SUCCEDA LA VIE MONASTIQUE CAR LES EXTREMES SE TOUCHENT ET CHEZ L'HOMME SINCERE LA SINCERITE DU REPENTIR AMENE NECESSAIREMENT A LA SUITE AVEC LUI LA RIGUEUR DE LA PENITENCE
AND EVERY SUNDAY SHE WENT ALONE TO THE GERMAN AND ENGLISH CHAPELS
HE HAD COME HOME A DAY OR TWO BEFORE APPARENTLY FOR A HOLIDAY
DISSENT WAS SCHISM AND SCHISM WAS CONDEMNED IN THE BIBLE
CETTE FAIBLESSE DE VUE EST POUR MOI UNE TERRIBLE PRIVATION
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER AND LIKED EACH OTHER A GOOD WHILE
HENCE THEY WERE PROTECTED BY THE AUTHORITIES AND EASILY OBTAINED FAVOURABLE AND SHELTERED SITES FOR THEIR EXERCISE-GROUND
IL PIERRE LIT DANS L'AVENIR
CHARLOTTE BRONTE WAS HAPPY IN THE CHOICE MADE FOR HER OF THE SECOND SCHOOL TO WHICH SHE WAS SENT
IS THERE ANY TALK OF YOUR COMING TO BRUSSELS
THE EXTREMELY UNTIDY APPEARANCE OF THE VILLAGERS SHOCKED ME NOT A LITTLE THOUGH I MUST DO THE HOUSEWIVES THE JUSTICE TO SAY THAT THE COTTAGES THEMSELVES WERE NOT DIRTY AND HAD AN AIR OF ROUGH PLENTY ABOUT THEM EXCEPT WHEN TRADE WAS BAD THAT I HAD NOT BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO SEE IN THE FARMING DISTRICTS
I HAVE WALKED TO HALIFAX A DISTANCE OF TEN MILES MANY A TIME FOR HALF A REAM OF PAPER FOR FEAR OF BEING WITHOUT IT WHEN THEY CAME
AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED NEITHER WE NOR OUR POEMS WERE AT ALL WANTED
AND ON HIS ADMITTING IT SHE FURTHER INQUIRED IF HE HAD NOT PASSED A CONSIDERABLE TIME IN GERMANY AND WAS ANSWERED THAT HE HAD
BUT HE RATHER LIKED TO PRESENT HIS ROUGH SIDE TO ANY STRANGER OR NEW-COMER
WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING OF HER DAUGHTER'S RARE TALENTS MRS BRONTE MUST HAVE BEEN I IMAGINE THAT UNUSUAL CHARACTER A WELL-BALANCED AND CONSISTENT WOMAN
SO I CONVERSED WITH THIS IRISHMAN AND LAUGHED AT HIS JESTS
TO COMPLETE THE PICTURE TABBY BLOWING THE FIRE IN ORDER TO BOIL THE POTATOES TO A SORT OF VEGETABLE GLUE
THEY REMIND ME TOO STRONGLY OF MY TWO SISTERS WHOM NO POWER OF MEDICINE COULD SAVE
I TAKE THE ONLY OTHER REMAINING PERSONAL FRAGMENT OUT OF TALES OF THE ISLANDERS IT IS A SORT OF APOLOGY CONTAINED IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND VOLUME FOR THEIR NOT HAVING BEEN CONTINUED BEFORE
AND SHE RESOLVED TO COMPEL HERSELF TO REMAIN IN BRUSSELS TILL THAT WAS GAINED
IT WAS VERY FORCED WORK TO ADDRESS HIM
THE STRANGE INCIDENT IN THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON'S LIFE
HE PROPOSED TO READ TO THEM SOME OF THE MASTER-PIECES OF THE MOST CELEBRATED FRENCH AUTHORS SUCH AS CASIMIR DE LA VIGNE'S POEM ON THE DEATH OF JOAN OF ARC PARTS OF BOSSUET THE ADMIRABLE TRANSLATION OF THE NOBLE LETTER OF ST IGNATIUS TO THE ROMAN CHRISTIANS IN THE BIBLIOTHEQUE CHOISIE DES PERES DE L'EGLISE C AND AFTER HAVING THUS IMPRESSED THE COMPLETE EFFECT OF THE WHOLE TO ANALYSE THE PARTS WITH THEM POINTING OUT IN WHAT SUCH OR SUCH AN AUTHOR EXCELLED AND WHERE WERE THE BLEMISHES
POPULAR ADMIRATION WAS SWEET TO HIM
YOU HAVE CHEERED ME MY DARLING
I HAVE AN IDEA THAT I SHOULD BE OF NO USE THERE--A SORT OF AGED PERSON UPON THE PARISH
I CAN DO VERY WELL UNDER THIS SORT OF THING
A TRUE STORY
SOME WEEKS PASSED OVER WITHOUT THE MIGHTY MURMURING PUBLIC DISCOVERING THAT THREE MORE VOICES WERE UTTERING THEIR SPEECH
THE WIND WHICH IS VERY HIGH UP IN OUR HILLS OF JUDEA THOUGH I SUPPOSE DOWN IN THE PHILISTINE FLATS OF B
LE 31 JUILLET 1842
AT ANY RATE I CANNOT COME THIS WEEK FOR WE ARE IN THE VERY THICKEST MELEE OF THE REPETITIONS
VOUS ETES FAIBLES
MARCH 24TH 1845
AND THE TRAIN FROM LEEDS TO LONDON WHICH SHOULD HAVE REACHED EUSTON-SQUARE EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON WAS SO MUCH DELAYED THAT IT DID NOT GET IN TILL TEN AT NIGHT
I LOOKED IT OVER AND SOMETHING MORE THAN SURPRISE SEIZED ME--A DEEP CONVICTION THAT THESE WERE NOT COMMON EFFUSIONS NOR AT ALL LIKE THE POETRY WOMEN GENERALLY WRITE
WE HAVE HAD ONE LETTER FROM HER SINCE SHE WENT
14
THIS SOLITUDE WAS A PERILOUS LUXURY TO ONE OF HER TEMPERAMENT
AND THIS LOVING ASSUMPTION OF DUTIES BEYOND HER YEARS MADE HER FEEL CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN SHE REALLY WAS
THE FIRST IS FROM A LETTER TO EMILY BEGINNING WITH ONE OF THE TENDER EXPRESSIONS IN WHICH IN SPITE OF HUMBUG SHE INDULGED HERSELF
2 THIS TABLET WHICH CORRECTS THE ERROR IN THE FORMER TABLET AS TO THE AGE OF ANNE BRONTE BEARS THE FOLLOWING INSCRIPTION IN ROMAN LETTERS
BUT DEVOTING THEMSELVES WITH INDEFATIGABLE DILIGENCE TO THE DIFFERENT STUDIES IN WHICH THEY WERE ENGAGED
BEG BORROW OR STEAL IT WITHOUT DELAY
NOTHING OF THE SORT
BOTH CHARLOTTE AND EMILY RETURNED TO SCHOOL AFTER THE MIDSUMMER HOLIDAYS IN THIS FATAL YEAR
D
DROP THE SUBJECT SHE COULD BEAR MUCH FOR HERSELF
I COULD LIKE TO WORK IN A MILL
MARIA READ THE NEWSPAPERS AND REPORTED INTELLIGENCE TO HER YOUNGER SISTERS WHICH IT IS WONDERFUL THEY COULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN
THE STAIRS TOO I BELIEVE ARE MADE OF STONE
I AM NOT SURE WHETHER MR BRONTE DID NOT CONSIDER DISTRUST OF OTHERS AS A PART OF THAT KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE ON WHICH HE PIQUED HIMSELF
SHE KNEW THE ARTISTS AND KNOW WHERE OTHER PRODUCTIONS OF THEIRS WERE TO BE FOUND
THEY WERE MADDENED AND DESPERATE
NONE OF THE BRONTES HAD THE FEVER
MR BRONTE WITH ALL HIS WARM REGARD FOR CHURCH AND STATE HAD A GREAT RESPECT FOR MENTAL FREEDOM
WHAT TO FIND THERE
HEGER ALWAYS LEFT TO THEM
ONE OF HER FRIENDS SAYS:--"I HAVE SEEN HER TURN PALE AND FEEL FAINT WHEN IN HARTSHEAD CHURCH SOME ONE ACCIDENTALLY REMARKED THAT WE WERE WALKING OVER GRAVES
HOW COULD SHE BE OTHERWISE THAN FLAT-SPIRITED A POOR COMPANION AND A SAD DRAG ON THE GAIETY OF THOSE WHO WERE LIGHT-HEARTED AND HAPPY
EMILY AND CHARLOTTE IMMEDIATELY RESOLVED TO GO HOME STRAIGHT AND HASTILY PACKED UP FOR ENGLAND DOUBTFUL WHETHER THEY SHOULD EVER RETURN TO BRUSSELS OR NOT LEAVING ALL THEIR RELATIONS WITH M
THE OBNOXIOUS CLERGYMAN AND HIS FRIENDS MOUNTED IN HASTE AND HAD SPED SOME DISTANCE BEFORE THE PEOPLE FOUND OUT THAT THEIR PREY HAD ESCAPED AND CAME RUNNING TO THE CLOSED TURNPIKE GATE
THE FRAME-WORK OF THE DOORS AND THE LINTELS OF THE WINDOWS EVEN IN THE SMALLEST DWELLINGS ARE MADE OF BLOCKS OF STONE
I WON'T BE A COOK
AND ON SUNDAY MORNING I WILL JOIN YOU AT CHURCH IF IT BE CONVENIENT AND STAY TILL MONDAY
NOV
NOBODY COULD WRITE THINK OR SPEAK ON ANY SUBJECT BUT THE CATHOLIC QUESTION AND THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON AND MR PEEL
THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE NEVER LIKELY TO INHERIT MUCH MONEY
HEGER COST ME
EN PERDANT NOS DEUX CHERES ELEVES NOUS NE DEVONS PAS VOUS CACHER QUE NOUS EPROUVONS A LA FOIS ET DU CHAGRIN ET DE L'INQUIETUDE
PAPA DECIDEDLY OBJECTS TO MY GOING BY THE COACH AND WALKING TO B THOUGH I AM SURE I COULD MANAGE IT
HEGER TOOK UP A MORE ADVANCED PLAN THAT OF SYNTHETICAL TEACHING
THE ISLAND WAS FIFTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE AND CERTAINLY APPEARED MORE LIKE THE WORK OF ENCHANTMENT THAN ANYTHING REAL C
GENERAL INDEX TO THEIR CONTENTS:--1
THIS IS SATURDAY EVENING
HE TOOK UP HIS LODGINGS IN IT
THEN GIRLS RUNNING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE AND PEEPING BETWEEN TREE-STEMS AND UP A SHADOWY LANE COULD CATCH A GLIMPSE OF A FATHER OR BROTHER DRIVING TO MARKET IN HIS GIG
RULE 4TH STATES THE CLOTHING AND TOILETTE ARTICLES WHICH A GIRL IS EXPECTED TO BRING WITH HER
ONLY ANXIOUS AND DEJECTED FOR THE REASON JUST GIVEN CHARLOTTE DECLINED AN INVITATION TO THE ONLY HOUSE TO WHICH SHE WAS NOW EVER ASKED TO COME
PERHAPS TO BEGIN WITH THE GREATEST GENIUS IN THIS RARE FAMILY
AND THE IMPUDENCE OF THIS IS ONLY TO BE PARALLELED BY ANOTHER OF THEIR ASSERTIONS NAMELY THAT BY THEIR MAGIC MIGHT THEY CAN REDUCE THE WORLD TO A DESERT THE PUREST WATERS TO STREAMS OF LIVID POISON AND THE CLEAREST LAKES TO STAGNANT WATERS THE PESTILENTIAL VAPOURS OF WHICH SHALL SLAY ALL LIVING CREATURES EXCEPT THE BLOOD-THIRSTY BEAST OF THE FOREST AND THE RAVENOUS BIRD OF THE ROCK
SCOTT'S SWEET WILD ROMANTIC POETRY CAN DO YOU NO HARM
INDEED IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH WAS THE CASE FROM A PASSAGE REFERRING TO THIS TIME IN THE LETTER OF MARY FROM WHICH I HAVE BEFORE GIVEN EXTRACTS
THE SISTERS SPOKE TO NO ONE BUT FROM NECESSITY
THE SCHOOL WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE CLASSES
WHY CHILD
THEY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I CROSSED THE SEA MERELY TO RETURN AS TEACHER TO MADAME HEGERS
IT WAS NOT UNLIKELY THAT HE MIGHT SHORTLY BECOME BLIND
SOON AFTER CHARLOTTE RETURNED TO DEWSBURY MOOR SHE WAS DISTRESSED BY HEARING THAT HER FRIEND E WAS LIKELY TO LEAVE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME
ONCE PAPA LENT MY SISTER MARIA A BOOK
2ND VOL.:--1
THEY KNEW BUT LITTLE FRENCH AND WERE NOT PROFICIENTS IN MUSIC
AUSSI CE PEUPLE QUI ADORAIT BUONAPARTE S'IRRITAIT S'INSURGEAIT CONTRE LA MORGUE DE WELLINGTON
THE GREATEST VARIETY I EVER HAVE IS AFFORDED BY A LETTER FROM YOU OR BY MEETING WITH A PLEASANT NEW BOOK
SHE SAID THIS WAS WHAT SHE HAD LONG RESOLVED TO DO
IL NE FAUT PAS Y PENSER
SHE VENTURED TO ASK HIM IF SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE
HE WAS VERY EARNEST IN ENFORCING THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF SUNDAY
HE DOES NOT SAY SO BUT I KNOW HE WOULD RATHER I STAYED AT HOME
ISOLATED AS THE HILL VILLAGES MAY BE THEY ARE IN THE WORLD COMPARED WITH THE LONELINESS OF THE GREY ANCESTRAL HOUSES TO BE SEEN HERE AND THERE IN THE DENSE HOLLOWS OF THE MOORS
MY EARNEST WISH AND ENDEAVOUR WILL BE TO PLEASE THEM
HOMME DE ZELE ET DE CONSCIENCE IL VIENT DE SE DEMETTRE DES FONCTIONS ELEVEES ET LUCRATIVES QU'IL EXERCAIT A L'ATHENEE CELLES DE PREFET DES ETUDES PARCE QU'IL NE PEUT Y REALISER LE BIEN QU'IL AVAIT ESPERE INTRODUIRE L'ENSEIGNEMENT RELIGIEUX DANS LE PROGRAMME DES ETUDES
IN LOOKING OVER THE EARLIER PORTION OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE I AM STRUCK AFRESH BY THE ABSENCE OF HOPE WHICH FORMED SUCH A STRONG CHARACTERISTIC IN CHARLOTTE
SHE BENT HER WHOLE ENERGY TOWARDS THE FULFILMENT OF THE DUTIES IN HAND
THEY DID NOT WASTE MANY WORDS ON THE SUBJECT BUT EACH WORD THEY DID UTTER WAS WEIGHTY
IT ONLY MAKES ME NUMB AND SILENT
FOR SOME UNEXPLAINED REASON HE HAD GIVEN UP THE IDEA OF BECOMING A STUDENT OF PAINTING AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY AND HIS PROSPECTS IN LIFE WERE UNCERTAIN AND HAD YET TO BE SETTLED
I COULD NOT SIT ALL DAY LONG MAKING A GRAVE FACE BEFORE MY HUSBAND
IT WOULD BE WRONG IN ME TO DOUBT IT
MANY FULL OF LOVE AND ADMIRATION FOR MR WILSON SOME AS FULL OF DISLIKE AND INDIGNATION
ONE IS AN OLD MAID AND THE OTHER WILL BE ONE
AND IN THOSE MIDSUMMER HOLIDAYS OF 1836 HER FRIEND E
NOT ACCUSTOMED TO RESIST TEMPTATION IT IS TRUE FROM ANY HIGHER MOTIVE THAN STRONG FAMILY AFFECTION BUT SHOWING SO MUCH POWER OF ATTACHMENT TO ALL ABOUT HIM THAT THEY TOOK PLEASURE IN BELIEVING THAT AFTER A TIME HE WOULD RIGHT HIMSELF AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE PRIDE AND DELIGHT IN THE USE HE WOULD THEN MAKE OF HIS SPLENDID TALENTS
THE DOOR-STEPS ARE SPOTLESS
D'AUTRES ONT DIT ET REDIRONT SES EXPLOITS MOI JE M'ARRETE A CONTEMPLER L'ABANDONNEMENT DE SA DERNIERE HEURE
AT LAST EITHER PROMPTED BY SOME MISCHIEF-MAKER OR FROM SOME TIPSY IMPULSE HE CLAMBERED UP THE PULPIT STAIRS AND ATTEMPTED TO EMBRACE MR REDHEAD
HE GAVE WAY
SO I PROMISED TO STAY A LITTLE WHILE LONGER
SHE WAS NOT ONE TO TALK OVER-MUCH ABOUT ANY PROJECT WHILE IT REMAINED UNCERTAIN--TO SPEAK ABOUT HER LABOUR IN ANY DIRECTION WHILE ITS RESULT WAS DOUBTFUL
THEY SEEMED SO DISTRESSED ABOUT IT IF I HAD NONE
J'ARRIVAIT A HAWORTH EN PARFAITE SAUVETE SANS LE MOINDRE ACCIDENT OU MALHEUR
IN BELGIUM
AND AGAIN STILL LATER THIS WAS THE TIME FOR THE LAST SURVIVING SISTER TO WALK ALONE FROM OLD ACCUSTOMED HABIT ROUND AND ROUND THE DESOLATE ROOM THINKING SADLY UPON THE DAYS THAT WERE NO MORE BUT THIS CHRISTMAS OF 1836 WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS HOPES AND DARING ASPIRATIONS
HAWORTH SEEMS SUCH A LONELY QUIET SPOT BURIED AWAY FROM THE WORLD
SOME OF THE MORE RIOTOUS PUSHED THE SOOT-COVERED CHIMNEY-SWEEPER AGAINST MR REDHEAD AS HE TRIED TO ESCAPE
MAKE HASTE
DID YOU CHANCE IN YOUR LETTER TO MR H TO MENTION MY SPECTACLES
HEGER IN SPEAKING OF HER
EVIDENTLY IT WAS NEITHER FROM YOU NOR MARY MY ONLY CORRESPONDENTS
AND WHETHER IT WILL EVER COME OUT A FINE FULL-FLEDGED CHICKEN OR WILL TURN ADDLE AND DIE BEFORE IT CHEEPS IS ONE OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARE BUT DIMLY REVEALED BY THE ORACLES OF FUTURITY
SURELY YOU AND POLLY WILL COME AND SEE ME
THE IDEAS OF ROUSSEAU AND MR DAY ON EDUCATION HAD FILTERED DOWN THROUGH MANY CLASSES AND SPREAD THEMSELVES WIDELY OUT
AND ALSO 1_L
I WISH I COULD BE WITH HER TO ADMINISTER A LITTLE BALM
AND TO THIS DAY SHE THINKS THE TALES OF THE LADIES MAGAZINE INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO ANY TRASH OF MODERN LITERATURE
THEIR POSITION IN THE SCHOOL APPEARED TO THESE NEW COMERS ANALOGOUS TO WHAT IS OFTEN CALLED THAT OF A PARLOUR-BOARDER
AND I WOULD CHOOSE THE ISLE OF WIGHT EMILY
PERHAPS YOU WILL BE READY TO ACCUSE ME OF VANITY IN MENTIONING THIS BUT YOU MUST CONSIDER THAT I DO NOT BOAST OF IT
THE FACULTY OF SELF-GOVERNMENT IS I FEAR ALMOST DESTROYED IN HIM
AT LEAST SO SAID THE MINISTER OF THE PLACE
ABOUT THIS TIME TO HER MORE FAMILIAR CORRESPONDENTS SHE OCCASIONALLY CALLS HERSELF CHARLES THUNDER MAKING A KIND OF PSEUDONYM FOR HERSELF OUT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME AND THE MEANING OF HER GREEK SURNAME
BUT SANITARY MATTERS WERE LITTLE UNDERSTOOD THIRTY YEARS AGO
WITH HIS WATCH IT WAS PUT ON IN THE MORNING
DO YOU WANT SOME ONE TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR BOTTLE SIR
IN A FEW DAYS
I HOPE YOU ARE LAUGHING HEARTILY
SO GREAT WAS THE AMOUNT OF GOOD WHICH MR WILSON DID BY HIS CONSTANT UNWEARIED SUPERINTENDENCE THAT I CANNOT HELP FEELING SORRY THAT IN HIS OLD AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ERRORS WHICH HE WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE COMMITTED SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP AGAINST HIM IN A FORM WHICH RECEIVED SUCH WONDERFUL FORCE FROM THE TOUCH OF MISS BRONTE'S GREAT GENIUS
EDITION BY DAVID PRICE EMAIL CCX074@COVENTRY.AC.UK THE LIFE OF CHARLOTTE BRONTE--VOLUME 1 CHAPTER I THE LEEDS AND SKIPTON RAILWAY RUNS ALONG A DEEP VALLEY OF THE AIRE
I FEAR THE GREATER PART OF THEM ARE GOING TO HELL WITH THEIR EYES OPEN BUT IF THEY WERE SO BOUND IT WAS NOT FOR WANT OF EXERTION ON MR GRIMSHAW'S PART TO PREVENT THEM
THE DYING AND THE WATCHING ENGLISH GIRLS WERE AT THAT HOUR ALONE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND THE SOIL OF THAT COUNTRY GAVE JESSY A GRAVE
WAS A QUARTER OF HER INCOME
A THING TO BE SAVED TILL BEDTIME WHEN ONE HAS A MOMENT'S QUIET AND REST TO ENJOY IT THOROUGHLY
I HOPE I SHALL BE PUT IN MY GRAVE AS SOON AS I'M DEAD
AND NATURALLY THE LOT DEVOLVED UPON THE ELDER ONES TO FIND SOME OCCUPATION WHICH WOULD ENABLE THEM TO DO THIS
HE HAD DARED TO EMPLOY MACHINERY FOR THE DRESSING OF WOOLLEN CLOTH WHICH WAS AN UNPOPULAR MEASURE IN 1812 WHEN MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES CONSPIRED TO MAKE THE CONDITION OF THE MILL-HANDS UNBEARABLE FROM THE PRESSURE OF STARVATION AND MISERY
OF COURSE I WAS NOT SURPRISED KNOWING THAT SHE COULD AND DID WRITE VERSE
ALL OUR PLAYS ARE VERY STRANGE ONES
