I DID N'T TELL AND TOM LOOKED AMAZED AT THE CHANGE WHICH HAD COME OVER HER
BUT NOT BEING A RAT HE CAN'T GO THROUGH THE BITS OF WINDOWS
FANNY WAS JUST THEN IN THE MOOD TO FEEL THE BEAUTY OF THIS FOR THE SINCEREST EMOTION SHE HAD EVER KNOWN WAS BEGINNING TO MAKE HER DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF AND THE AIMLESS LIFE SHE LED
NOW THEN DON'T SLIP POLLY AND MR THOMAS HELPED THEM OUT WITH UNUSUAL POLITENESS FOR THAT FRIENDLY LITTLE SPEECH GRATIFIED HIM
IT SUITS OLD PEOPLE BETTER THAN YOUR OPERA THINGS AND MOTHER USED TO ENJOY IT SO MUCH AS HE SPOKE MR SHAW'S EYE TURNED TOWARD THE CORNER OF THE FIRE WHERE GRANDMA USED TO SIT
THOSE ARE WELL ENOUGH FOR IMPROVING READING
BUT SHE WAS GLAD WHEN THE PLAY WAS DONE AND THEY WERE SAFE AT HOME WHERE KIND GRANDMA WAS WAITING TO SEE THEM COMFORTABLY INTO BED
IT MAKES ME GRATEFUL AND CONTENTED SHOWS ME HOW RICH I AM AND KEEPS ME READY TO DO ALL I CAN FOR THESE POOR SOULS MY GOOD POLLY AND FANNY GAVE HER FRIENDS ARM AN AFFECTIONATE SQUEEZE WONDERING IF IT WAS THIS ALONE THAT HAD WORKED THE CHANGE IN POLLY
SHE IS A SENSIBLE BRAVE-HEARTED GIRL AND I RESPECT HER FOR DOING IT SAID MR SHAW EMPHATICALLY
POOR DEAR GIDDY SALLY POMROY AND SHE S A GREAT-GRANDMOTHER NOW CRIED THE OLD LADY AFTER READING ONE OF THE NOTES AND CLEARING THE MIST OFF HER GLASSES
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HER FOR SHE ACTS LIKE A WEATHERCOCK AND I NEVER KNOW HOW I M GOING TO FIND HER
POLLY SUNG AND TOLD STORIES
VERY GOOD POLLY YOU ARE GETTING ON FAST WHISPERED TOM PATTING HIS YELLOW KIDS APPROVINGLY
BUT I SHALL COME TO GRIEF FOR I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR OLD DANCES YES YOU DO
HE COULD N'T ROB HIS GIRLS HE SAID AND THAT S ALL SAFE FOR EM
SUCH BASE ASSAULTS UPON POOR KATY AND THE COLORED WAITER WHO DID HIS BEST BUT WAS HELPLESS IN THE HANDS OF THE ROBBER HORDE
TALENT ENERGY AND CHARACTER TOOK THE FIRST RANK
YOU RE AS CROSS AS A LITTLE BEAR TO-DAY SAID FANNY PUSHING HER AWAY
GAVE HIM ONE OF THE QUIET KISSES THAT HAD MORE THAN USUAL TENDERNESS IN IT FOR SHE LOVED TO HEAR HIM SAY MY OTHER DAUGHTER AND THEN SHE WHISPERED DON'T YOU WANT TOM TOO OF COURSE I DO
AH THAT S SOMETHING LIKE HE THOUGHT AS HE WATCHED THE BRONZE BOOTS RETREATING AND ADVANCING IN PERFECT TIME TO THE MUSIC
FOR DESTRUCTIVENESS IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST TRAITS OF CHILDHOOD AND RIPPING WAS MAUD'S DELIGHT
A SINGLE GLANCE SHOWED POLLY THAT SOMETHING WAS THE MATTER FOR THE CARE AND ELEGANCE WHICH USUALLY MARKED HIS APPEARANCE WERE ENTIRELY WANTING
TOM COLORED UP AND LOOKED HURT FOR A MINUTE THEN SEEMED TO RIGHT HIMSELF WITH A SHRUG AND SAID IN HIS OUTSPOKEN WAY TO TELL THE HONEST TRUTH POLLY IT WAS NOT A VERY HARD ONE
LET ME SEE FIVE BONNETS
I LL DODGE AND GO ROUNDABOUT WAYS SO THAT WE CAN'T MEET
WE WERE TO DARKEN THE WINDOW OF THE INNER CHAMBER SET A WATCH IN THE LITTLE ENTRY LIGHT UP AND THEN FOR A GOOD TIME
WE SHOOK AND SHOOK TILL WE GOT RED IN THE FACE BUT NOT ONE DROPPED FOR THE TREE WAS LARGE AND OUR LITTLE ARMS WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO STIR THE BOUGHS
YOU SEE TRIX HAS BROKEN OFF TWO ENGAGEMENTS ALREADY AND THE THIRD TIME SHE GOT JILTED HERSELF
TOM SAID NOTHING BUT DREW TOWARD HIM A PAPER OF FIGURES WHICH HIS FATHER HAD DRAWN UP AND SPEEDILY REDUCED HIMSELF TO THE VERGE OF DISTRACTION BY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEM IN HIS ARDENT DESIRE TO PROVE HIS WILLINGNESS TO PUT HIS SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL
NOT TILL LONG AFTERWARD DID POLLY SEE HOW MUCH GOOD THIS LITTLE EFFORT HAD DONE HER FOR THE FIRST SMALL SACRIFICE OF THIS SORT LEADS THE WAY TO OTHERS AND A SINGLE HAND'S TURN GIVEN HEARTILY TO THE WORLD'S GREAT WORK HELPS ONE AMAZINGLY WITH ONE'S OWN SMALL TASKS
THERE WAS THE LITTLE ROUND HAT AND TOM GAVE IT A REMORSEFUL SMOOTH REMEMBERING HOW MANY TIMES HE HAD TWEAKED IT HALF OFF OR POKED IT OVER POOR POLLY'S EYES
THE SUNNY SIDE CHAPTER 14
THERE S A PHOTOGRAPH OF TOM CAME IN HIS LAST LETTER
SO IT DID ME FOR FAN ALWAYS INSISTED IT WAS THE MONEY AND NOT THE MAN SHE CARED FOR
TIDY LITTLE SUM IS N'T IT ASKED TOM WHO COULD N'T BEAR THE SILENCE OR THE STARTLED GRIEVED LOOK IN POLLY'S EYES
HE BOUNCED OUT AT HER FROM BEHIND DOORS BOOED AT HER IN DARK ENTRIES CLUTCHED HER FEET AS SHE WENT UP STAIRS STARTLED HER BY SHRILL WHISTLES RIGHT IN HER EAR OR SUDDEN TWEAKS OF THE HAIR AS HE PASSED HER IN THE STREET
THAT WILL AMUSE YOU AND FANNY GOT UP PLUMING HERSELF AS A BIRD DOES BEFORE ITS FLIGHT
HE TORMENTED YET AMUSED HER
AND THOSE ARE WHAT THEY HAVE SET THEIR HEARTS UPON
I WOULD N'T MIND TAKING LESSONS MYSELF WAS THE GRACIOUS OBSERVATION OF SHAW JR AS HE TURNED FROM THE MIRROR WITH THE SOOTHING CERTAINTY THAT HIS OBJECTIONABLE HAIR ACTUALLY WAS GROWING DARKER
HOW DO YOU KNOW
I LL GO AND ASK GRANDMA WHAT I CAN DO
YOUR LESSONS DID N'T USE TO TAKE UP ALL YOUR TIME
BUT AS I DID SO MY FOOT SLIPPED I TRIED TO CATCH SOMETHING TO HOLD BY BUT FOUND NOTHING AND WITH A CRY DOWN I FELL LIKE A VERY BIG PLUM ON THE GRASS BELOW
LEAD IDLE GIDDY UNHEALTHY LIVES AND GET BLASE AT TWENTY
SERVANTS OUGHT TO BE MADE TO DRESS LIKE SERVANTS AS THEY DO ABROAD
MAY N'T SHE GRANDMA CRIED TOM GALLANTLY COMING TO THE RESCUE AND SECURING A POWERFUL ALLY
YOU SEE I PICK OUT SOMETHING IN THE CABINET THAT LOOKS INTERESTING AND THEN SHE TELLS ME ABOUT IT SAID POLLY EAGER TO INCLUDE THE GIRLS IN HER PLEASURES AND GLAD TO GET THEM INTERESTED IN GRANDMA'S REMINISCENCES FOR POLLY KNEW HOW HAPPY IT MADE THE LONELY OLD LADY TO LIVE OVER HER PAST AND TO HAVE THE CHILDREN ROUND HER
AND WHILE DOING THEM WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF THANKS SHE MADE SUNSHINE FOR HERSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS
FOR THERE WAS A FREEDOM ABOUT IT THAT WAS CHARMING AN ARTISTIC FLAVOR TO EVERYTHING AND SUCH A SPIRIT OF GOOD-WILL AND GAYETY THAT SHE FELT AT HOME AT ONCE
WILL YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT
BUT NEVER TRIED TO POLISH HIM UP A BIT
SHE FELT THAT ATONEMENT WAS PROPER AND CONSIDERED IT NO MORE THAN JUST THAT FAN SHOULD DRENCH A HANDKERCHIEF OR TWO WITH REPENTANT TEARS AND THAT TOM SHOULD SIT ON A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SEAT AND CALL HIMSELF HARD NAMES FOR FIVE OR TEN MINUTES BEFORE SHE RELENTED
FANNY SEEMED GLAD OF THIS AND POLLY SOON SET HER HEART AT REST BY PROVING THAT SHE HAD NO WISH TO TRY HER POWER
BECAUSE POLLY WOULD N'T LET HER FRIEND DO UP HER HAIR LIKE OTHER FOLKS AND BORE HER EARS
MY CHILDREN BEWARE OF POPULARITY
BEING MADE COMFORTABLE WITH THE FURNITURE MADAM LEFT THERE WHEN SHE WENT TO LIVE WITH HER SON
POLLY WAS GLAD TO BE ALONE FOR A FEW MINUTES
HE KNOWS DON'T BELIEVE HE DOES
STRENGTH AND BEAUTY MUST GO TOGETHER
THEN HE HAD N'T DONE ANYTHING FOR HER BUT CARRY THE BAG A FEW STEPS
A LONG PAUSE BROKEN BY MORE SCRATCHING
PERHAPS MAMMA IS SICKER THAN USUAL OR PAPA WORRIED ABOUT BUSINESS OR TOM IN SOME NEW SCRAPE
REBECCA SMILED BRIGHTLY AND BESS LOOKED ROUND TO NOD APPROVINGLY BUT POLLY CLAPPED HER HANDS AND SAID WELL DONE FAN
MAUD AND HER BOSOM FRIEND GWACE WERE SEATED ON TIN CAKE-BOXES
PERHAPS HE WOULD N'T LIKE IT
IT S LIKE YOU TO SAY IT AND I WON'T WASTE ANY WORDS BEWAILING MYSELF BECAUSE I WAS A FOOL
NELLY DROPPED THE BOWL AND RAN
AT A BALL AT LADY RUSSELL'S LAST NIGHT I SAW THE PRINCE OF WALES AND DANCED IN THE SET WITH HIM
FOR SHE SAW THAT HER SIMPLE MUSIC HAD PLEASED HER LISTENER AND SHE FELT GLAD TO KNOW IT
THE LAST WORDS AND THE APPEALING HAND OUTSTRETCHED TO HER TOLD FANNY THE SECRET OF HER FRIEND'S TENDER SYMPATHY FOR HER OWN LOVE TROUBLES AND SEEMED SO PATHETIC THAT SHE TOOK POLLY IN HER ARMS AND CRIED OVER HER IN THE FOND FOOLISH WAY GIRLS HAVE OF DOING WHEN THEIR HEARTS ARE FULL AND TEARS CAN SAY MORE THAN TONGUES
LET S CLUB TOGETHER AND HAVE A REVEL SAID KATE PRODUCING A BAG OF ORANGES AND SEVERAL BIG PLUMMY BUNS
SHE DOES N'T SAY
YES IT IS TOO
NOW IT S ALL OVER AND DONE WITH THOUGHT POLLY AS SHE FELL ASLEEP AFTER A LONG VIGIL
IF TOM HAD HAD ANY THOUGHTS OF FOLLOWING HIS FATHER'S EXAMPLE SOMETHING IN POLLY'S MANNER MADE HIM CHANGE HIS MIND AND SHAKE HANDS WITH A HEARTY I M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU POLLY ADDING TO HIMSELF AS HE LOOKED AT THE FACE IN THE MODEST LITTLE BONNET
NOW THEN FALL TO LADIES AND HELP YOURSELVES
WHILE POLLY FORGOT TO BE SHY AND LIKED THIS SORT OF TOUGHENING MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHER
POWDERED HIS FACE WITH HER VIOLET-POWDER
AS IF THE MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE GOD WISHED TO TAKE POLLY AT A DISADVANTAGE OR PERHAPS TO GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE JUST AT THAT INSTANT MR SYDNEY APPEARED AT HER SIDE
I M GLAD I CAME THOUGH FOR I SEE MONEY DON'T GIVE PEOPLE EVERYTHING
SHE PAYS HER CHAMBER GIRL WITH OLD FINERY
I NEVER SAW HER AND SHE NEVER SAW ME
BUT I WILL
I M SO GLAD YOU ARE GOING TO BE HERE ALL WINTER FOR WE ARE TO BE VERY GAY AND I SHALL ENJOY TAKING YOU ROUND WITH ME BEGAN FANNY FORGETTING POLLY'S PLAN FOR A MOMENT
THANK YOU FOR THE SUGGESTION KATE
THERE WON'T BE ANY ONE TO HELP THE OLD GENTLEMAN SAFELY HOME TO-MORROW HE SAID AS POLLY TOOK HIS HAND IN BOTH HERS WITH AN AFFECTIONATE SQUEEZE
NOW WHILE THIS HAD BEEN HAPPENING MAUD HAD BEEN GETTING INTO HOT WATER ALSO
CHAPTER VIII
SHE S SORRY I KNOW AND WON'T FORGET WHAT YOU SAY ANY MORE IF YOU LL FORGIVE HER THIS ONCE CRIED POLLY VERY EARNESTLY WHEN THE FOOLISH LITTLE STORY WAS TOLD
THEN SHE TOOK A FANCY INTO HER HEAD THAT SHE OUGHT TO ACCEPT THIS PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY AND FORGET HERSELF
HAD FORGOTTEN M
YOU MIGHT AS WELL WISH EM IN YOUR MOUTH AND DONE WITH IT IF YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO PICK EM UP
SHE WON'T COME I KNOW
MAUD BEING BORNE AWAY BY KATY
SHE COULD NOT DO ENOUGH TO PROVE HER GRATITUDE FOR FORMER FAVORS AND WENT TOILING AND MOILING ABOUT FEELING THAT THE HARDEST MOST DISAGREEABLE TASKS WERE HER ESPECIAL DUTY
WHILE TOM AND RUMPLE FORAGED FOR THE PARTY
WAIT A MINUTE AND YOU WILL SEE ME DO IT CRIED I AS A NEW THOUGHT CAME INTO MY NAUGHTY HEAD
COAL-HOLE ANSWERED A SPECTRAL VOICE FROM THE GLOOM ABOVE
AS POLLY READ THAT SHORT NOTE ALL THE COLOR WENT OUT OF HER FACE AND HER EYES BEGAN TO KINDLE
ARE YOU TIRED POLLY ASKED TOM BENDING DOWN TO LOOK INTO HER FACE
AND DID N'T MIND THE PAIN HALF AS MUCH AS THE LOSS OF THE PLUMS
WHO CARES FOR A COUNTRIFIED LITTLE THING LIKE HER SAID TOM MANFULLY TO HIMSELF
FANNY BROUGHT OUT HER RAGS AND WAS ASTONISHED TO SEE HOW MANY SHE HAD FOR CHAIR SOFA BED AND BUREAU WERE COVERED AND STILL MAUD WHO WAS BURROWING IN THE CLOSETS KEPT CRYING HERE S ANOTHER THERE S A DISCOURAGING HEAP OF RUBBISH FOR YOU SAID FAN AS SHE ADDED A FADED MUSLIN TO THE LAST PILE
A GLIMPSE OF A MOTHERLY-LOOKING LADY ENTERING A DOOR RECEIVED BY A FLOCK OF PRETTY CHILDREN WHO CAST THEMSELVES UPON MAMMA AND HER PARCELS WITH CRIES OF RAPTURE DID POLLY GOOD
IT SUITS ME TO BE VERY BUSY AND SHE BEGAN TO DRAG ON HER GLOVES AS IF TO PROVE IT
CHAPTER II
TRIX NEVER DID
THEN EACH WENT ON WITH HER WORK AND ALL BEGAN TO TALK
AND WITH A VERY EARNEST PRAYER POLLY ASKED FOR THE STRENGTH OF AN UPRIGHT SOUL THE BEAUTY OF A TENDER HEART THE POWER TO MAKE HER LIFE A SWEET AND STIRRING SONG HELPFUL WHILE IT LASTED REMEMBERED WHEN IT DIED
I LIKE THAT AS MUCH AS I HATE LATIN POLLY ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND SOON OWNED THAT TOM COULD BEAT HER HERE
OLD DEANE PUTS US THROUGH DOUBLE-QUICK AND DON'T GIVE A FELLOW TIME TO ASK QUESTIONS WHEN WE READ ASK YOUR FATHER
POLLY SENT BACK ALL THE EXTRACTS FROM NED'S LETTERS CONCERNING TOM AND BY PUTTING THE TWO REPORTS TOGETHER THEY GAINED THE COMFORTABLE ASSURANCE THAT TOM WAS WELL IN GOOD SPIRITS HARD AT WORK AND INTENT ON COMING OUT STRONG IN SPITE OF ALL OBSTACLES
THAT WOULD N'T BE MY WAY NO
CHAPTER III
POLLY S WAKED UP I M GLAD OF IT AND SO S SYD I ONLY SPOKE FOR YOUR GOOD DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT ME
BUT OF COURSE IT WAS PROPER OR ALL OUR SET WOULD N'T GO
OF COURSE SHE WAS DELIGHTED AND WE ALL FLEW ABOUT TO MAKE READY FOR HIM
BOYS ARE ALL HORRID
I DID N'T SAY ANYTHING BUT I HAD MY SUSPICIONS
THEY STEPPED ASIDE AND HE WHIZZED BY ARMS AND LEGS GOING LIKE MAD WITH THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF A RUNAWAY ENGINE
WELL MY DEAR GRANDMA WAS SAYING SHE HAD IT ON THE VERY DAY THAT UNCLE JOE CAME IN AS SHE SAT AT WORK AND SAID DOLLY WE MUST BE MARRIED AT ONCE VERY WELL JOE SAYS AUNT DOLLY AND DOWN SHE WENT TO THE PARLOR WHERE THE MINISTER WAS WAITING NEVER STOPPING TO CHANGE THE DIMITY DRESS SHE WORE AND WAS ACTUALLY MARRIED WITH HER SCISSORS AND PIN-BALL AT HER SIDE AND HER THIMBLE ON
HE STAYED AT HOME A GOOD DEAL AND LOAFED ABOUT WITH A MELANCHOLY AND NEGLECTED AIR VANISHED WHEN ANYONE CAME TALKED VERY LITTLE AND WAS EITHER PATHETICALLY HUMBLE OR TRAGICALLY CROSS
THE MUSLINS ONLY NEED MENDING AND DOING UP TO LOOK AS WELL AS EVER
FOR OF ALL THE SILLY FREAKS OF THIS FAST AGE THAT OF LITTLE PEOPLE PLAYING AT LOVE IS ABOUT THE SILLIEST
NOW LET S HAVE THE NUTS I SAID GROPING FOR THE PAPER BAG
IT WON'T HURT YOU
GO TO BED MAUDIE AND LOOK UNDER YOUR PILLOW WHEN YOU GET THERE WAS THE ORACULAR REPLY THAT CAME DOWN TO THEM AS TOM'S DOOR CLOSED AFTER A JUBILANT SOLO ON THE TIN PAN
WON'T YOUR HANDS BE COLD IN KID GLOVES SHE SAID AS THEY WENT DOWN THE SNOWY STREET WITH A NORTH WIND BLOWING IN THEIR FACES
HE D LIKE IT AND RESPECT YOU FOR DOING IT
I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN HELP IT WHEN YOU PLEAD SO WELL FOR HER
I REALLY HAVE N'T THE HEART TO RELATE THE DREADFUL LECTURES SHE GOT THE SNUBS SHE SUFFERED OR THE COLD SHOULDERS TURNED UPON HER FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THIS
BECAUSE SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOU
AND HAVING DANCED A DOUBLE-SHUFFLE ON THE DOOR-MAT TOM RETIRED TO THE DINING-ROOM TO RESTORE EXHAUSTED NATURE WITH HALF A DOZEN COOKIES
POLLY SCOFFED AT THIS SORT OF THING SOMETIMES BUT TO-NIGHT SHE ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT A MURMUR RATHER ENJOYED IT IN FACT LET HER BRACELETS SHINE BEFORE THE EYES OF ALL MEN AND FELT THAT IT WAS GOOD TO SEEM COMELY IN THEIR SIGHT
I DARE SAY HE THOUGHT I WAS A VAIN GOOSE AND LAUGHED AT ME FOR MY PAINS LIKE CHURCHILL IN HELEN NO HE WOULD N'T
TO HIS SURPRISE SHE SEEMED ALMOST RELIEVED AND AFTER A MINUTE SILENCE SAID SOBERLY THAT S BAD VERY BAD
I HEARD HER SQUEAL AND SAW HER CUDDLE UP HER FEET AND YOU HEARD US PRAISE YOUR MANNERS DID N'T YOU ASKED POLLY SLYLY
FOR I HAVE N'T BEEN HALF AS PATIENT AND PLEASANT AS I OUGHT TO BE
I M A PRETTY POOR AFFAIR POLLY BUT I M NOT MEAN ENOUGH TO DO THAT WHILE I VE GOT A CONSCIENCE AND A PAIR OF HANDS A ROUGH SPEECH BUT IT PLEASED POLLY BETTER THAN THE SMOOTHEST TOM HAD EVER MADE IN HER HEARING FOR SOMETHING IN HIS FACE AND VOICE TOLD HER THAT THE FRIENDLY ACT HAD ROUSED A NOBLER SENTIMENT THAN GRATITUDE MAKING THE CANCELLED OBLIGATIONS OF THE BOY DEBTS OF HONOR TO THE MAN
POLLY DANCED ALL OVER THE ROOM BESS AND BECKY HUGGED ONE ANOTHER AND KATE LAUGHED WITH HER EYES FULL WHILE EVEN FANNY FELT A GLOW OF PRIDE AND PLEASURE AT THE KIND ACT
COME NOW DO SAY A WORD TO A FELLOW
MRS FINN TOLD ME SHE WAS POOR BUT A BUSY HONEST LITTLE THING WHO DID N'T MIX WITH THE OTHER FOLKS BUT LIVED AND WORKED ALONE
AS SHE ENTERED THE SHAWS PARLOR AN HOUR OR TWO LATER AN APPALLING ARRAY OF WELL-DRESSED GIRLS APPEARED EACH PROVIDED WITH A DAINTY RETICULE BASKET OR BAG AND EACH TONGUE GOING A GOOD DEAL FASTER THAN THE NEEDLE WHILE THE WHITE FINGERS STITCHED SLEEVES IN UPSIDE DOWN PUT FLANNEL JACKETS TOGETHER HIND PART BEFORE OR GOBBLED BUTTON-HOLES WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS IN LIFE
I CAN'T SAY WHERE THE TROUBLE IS BUT THERE S TOO MUCH FUSS AND FEATHERS FOR MY TASTE
SHE WAS LIVING IN FEDERAL STREET AT THE TIME A MOST ARISTOCRATIC STREET THEN CHILDREN AND WE LIVED CLOSE BY
I LL DO MY BEST HE SAID HEARTILY AS HE PRESSED THE HAND POLLY GAVE HIM WITH A LOOK WHICH ASSURED HER THAT HE FELT THE APPEAL TO HIS HONOR AND THAT HENCEFORTH THE COUNTRY LAD WAS SAFE FROM ALL THE TEMPTATIONS TOM COULD HAVE OFFERED HIM
NO NO I CAN NEVER CARE FOR HIM AND IT S NO USE TO TRY THE EXCLAMATION BROKE FROM POLLY AS IF A SUDDEN TROUBLE HAD SEIZED HER AND LAYING HER HEAD DOWN ON HER KNEES SHE SAT MOTIONLESS FOR MANY MINUTES
VERY LIKE THE FASHION-PLATES YOU GOT THE PATTERNS OF YOUR DRESSES FROM
I ALWAYS FED THEM MYSELF
SO IT WAS N'T HIM SAID FANNY DISCONSOLATELY FOR SHE BEGAN TO THINK THIS DOUBLE LOSS A PUNISHMENT FOR LETTING ANGRY PASSIONS RISE LET S OPEN THE DOOR AND TELL HIM ABOUT IT PROPOSED POLLY
MAY N'T I POLLY BEARS LIKE SWEET THINGS SO YOU WANT SOME CANDY I GUESS
AS SHE PAUSED AT THE BEDSIDE THINKING THE GIRL ASLEEP A PAIR OF HOLLOW DARK EYES OPENED WIDE AND LOOKED UP AT HER
AND AS POLLY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE ESTABLISHED HERSELF IN A WINDOW RECESS TO WATCH THE MYSTERIES
PLAYING GRANDMOTHER I THINK TOM HAD THE HARDEST TIME OF ALL FOR BESIDES THE FAMILY TROUBLES HE HAD MANY OF HIS OWN TO PERPLEX AND HARASS HIM
AS SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND AND LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH THOSE CONFIDING EYES OF HERS TOM'S GRATITUDE SEEMED TO FLY TO HIS HEAD FOR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST WARNING HE STOOPED DOWN AND KISSED HER A PROCEEDING WHICH STARTLED POLLY SO THAT HE RECOVERED HIMSELF AT ONCE AND RETREATED INTO HIS DEN WITH THE INCOHERENT APOLOGY I BEG PARDON COULD N'T HELP IT GRANDMA ALWAYS LET ME ON MY BIRTHDAY WHILE POLLY TOOK REFUGE UP STAIRS FORGETTING ALL ABOUT FAN AS SHE SAT IN THE DARK WITH HER FACE HIDDEN WONDERING WHY SHE WAS N'T VERY ANGRY AND RESOLVING NEVER AGAIN TO INDULGE IN THE DELIGHTFUL BUT DANGEROUS PASTIME OF PLAYING GRANDMOTHER
POLLY WHO HAD PAUSED TO LISTEN TO THE EDIFYING CHAT PARTED THE BELLIGERENTS AND FINDING THE POOR THINGS TIRED CROSS AND SLEEPY YET UNABLE TO GO HOME TILL SENT FOR PROPOSED TO PLAY GAMES
THERE S A REGULAR RUSH FOR IT AT THE LIBRARY
SEND THAT CHICKEN UP STAIRS AND COME IN AND HEAR ABOUT IT HE SAID AS IF HE HAD BEEN LONGING TO TELL SOME ONE AND WELCOMED PRUDENT POLLY AS A SPECIAL PROVIDENCE
WHY DID N'T SHE COME TOO ASKED POLLY TRYING TO LOOK DEMURE WHILE HER EYES DANCED IN SPITE OF HER
POLLY MADE NO ANSWER FEARING TO PAY TOO MUCH FOR SHE KNEW FAN HAD MADE NO CONFIDANT OF TOM AND SHE GUARDED HER FRIEND'S SECRET AS JEALOUSLY AS HER OWN
I MUST GO FOR I PROMISED A NEIGHBOR OF MINE A LESSON AT TWO I THOUGHT THIS WAS A HOLIDAY SAID FANNY
DON'T YOU PREACH POLLY
NIPPED IN THE BUD CHAPTER 15
YOU DEAR THING HOW HEAVENLY THAT WILL BE SHE CRIED
MOTHER DID N'T LIKE THE IDEA OF MY GOING TO A STRANGE BOARDING-HOUSE SO MISS MILLS KINDLY MADE A PLACE FOR ME
POLLY FELT IT AND IT DID HER GOOD
SYDNEY KNEW THIS AND LIKED HER FOR IT BUT HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT NEVERTHELESS BY ASKING SUDDENLY
SIT DOWN MY DEAR I M GLAD TO SEE YOU BUT EXCUSE ME IF I GO ON WITH MY WORK AS I M IN A DRIVING HURRY TO GET THESE THINGS DONE TO-NIGHT SAID THE BRISK LITTLE LADY WITH A SMILE AND A NOD AS SHE TOOK A NEW NEEDLEFUL OF THREAD AND RAN UP A SEAM AS IF FOR A WAGER
SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER FOR A MINUTE THEN THE LOST LOOK WENT AWAY AND SHE GAVE A GREAT SIGH AND TOOK MY HAND IN BOTH HER THIN BITS OF ONES AND SAID O MA'AM I FEEL AS IF I D BEEN BORN INTO A NEW WORLD
SHE WAS TOO SHY AND NEEDED TOUGHENING LIKE THE OTHER GIRLS
A LITTLE SMILE BEGAN TO DIMPLE THE CHEEK THAT WAS N'T HIDDEN AND THEN A HAND CAME SLOWLY OUT FROM UNDER THE CURLY HEAD AND WAS STRETCHED TOWARD HIM SILENTLY
NOW I LIKE THE ACTING BEST
FAN IS A GOOD SOUL BUT SHE IS N'T PRACTICAL AND WE ALWAYS GET INTO A SNARL IF WE TRY TO WORK TOGETHER SO WHO HAVE I BUT MY OTHER SISTER POLLY
BUT SHE KNEW ALSO THAT POLLY HAD MORE INFLUENCE OVER OTHERS THAN SHE HERSELF SUSPECTED SIMPLY BECAUSE OF HER CANDID UPRIGHT NATURE
FOR KATE LOOKED SICK TIRED AND TOO EARLY OLD
THAT WILL BE WISE
MISS MILLS HAS GIVEN HALF OF HERS AND CONSIDERS JANE HER CHILD ANSWERED POLLY WITH PROUD SATISFACTION IN THE FACT
GIRLS LATIN DON'T AMOUNT TO MUCH ANYWAY WAS THE GRATEFUL REPLY
YOU ARE SUCH A GENIUS FOR PLANNING AND WORKING WONDERS THAT I THROW MYSELF UPON YOU AND ASK HOW SHALL I MAKE A SPRING WARDROBE OUT OF NOTHING LET ME SEE THE NOTHING BEFORE I ADVISE
SHE HAS TRIED ALL SORTS OF POORLY PAID WORK COULD N'T LIVE ON IT DECENTLY GOT DISCOURAGED SICK FRIGHTENED AND COULD SEE NO REFUGE FROM THE BIG BAD WORLD BUT TO GET OUT OF IT WHILE SHE WAS N'T AFRAID TO DIE
NOW AND THEN WHEN MAUD FELT POORLY OR HAD A FWACTIOUS TURN FOR SHE HAD NERVES AS WELL AS MAMMA SHE WOULD GO TO POLLY TO BE AMOOSED FOR HER GENTLE WAYS AND KIND FORBEARANCE SOOTHED THE LITTLE FINE LADY BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE
WHY POLLY YOU RE GORGEOUS SHE FELT THAT HER FUN HAD DECIDEDLY BEGUN
I DON'T CARE
AFTER TEA THAT EVENING FANNY PROPOSED THAT POLLY SHOULD SHOW HER HOW TO MAKE MOLASSES CANDY AS IT WAS COOK'S HOLIDAY AND THE COAST WOULD BE CLEAR
I LEARNT IT HERE SIR ANSWERED POLLY LAUGHING
IT DID N'T MAKE HER VERY MISERABLE BECAUSE PATIENCE WORK AND COMMON-SENSE LENT HER A HAND AND HOPE WOULD KEEP POPPING UP ITS BRIGHT FACE FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER PANDORA-BOX OF TROUBLES
HE COULD N'T SLEEP SO THE GIRLS AMUSED HIM
I WISH OH POLLY HOW I WISH I HAD A HALF OF THE MONEY I VE WASTED TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE NOW NEVER MIND I DON'T WANT IT
IT WAS AN OLD-FASHIONED HOUSE SLOPING DOWN BEHIND AND THE CLOSET WINDOW CHOSEN BY US WAS NOT MANY FEET FROM THE GROUND
IT WAS A BAD CUT AND MUST BE SEWED UP AT ONCE THE DOCTOR SAID AS SOON AS HE CAME
ALL GONE TO SMASH
VERY ROUGH AND FAULTY BUT SO FUNNY THAT IT WAS EVIDENT POLLY'S SENSE OF HUMOR WAS STRONG
FEELING THAT THE SONG HAD PAVED THE WAY FOR THE STORY AND GIVEN HER COURAGE TO TELL IT POLLY DID TELL IT AND MUST HAVE DONE IT WELL FOR THE GIRLS STOPPED WORK TO LISTEN AND WHEN SHE ENDED OTHER EYES BESIDE WARM-HEARTED BELLE'S WERE WET
OH JUST ONE GOOD GALLOP WITH MR SYDNEY OR TOM
AS THE CARRIAGE DROVE OFF POLLY GAVE A LITTLE BOUNCE ON THE SPRINGY SEAT AND LAUGHED LIKE A DELIGHTED CHILD
BUT BY GEORGE
TOM SAW IT FLUSHED ALL OVER HIS BROWN FACE AND DROPPING THE RUBBERS WITH A CRASH TOOK HER HANDS SAYING IN HIS OLD IMPETUOUS WAY POLLY I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING YES I KNOW WE VE BEEN EXPECTING IT
GOOD IS N'T IT
I M AFRAID YOU LL SLIP AND GET HURT DON'T CARE IF I DO
MIND YOU I DON'T SAY MR SYDNEY LOVED ME FOR HE NEVER SAID SO AND NEVER WILL NOW BUT I DID FANCY HE RATHER LIKED ME AND MIGHT DO MORE IF I DID N'T SHOW HIM THAT IT WAS OF NO USE AND YOU DID CRIED FANNY MUCH EXCITED
THEN THAT PIQU IS ALL RIGHT IF YOU CUT THE TAIL OFF THE JACKET AND CHANGE THE TRIMMING A BIT
AND THEN THEY FELL ASLEEP LEAVING TOM TO THE DELIGHTS OF TOOTHACHE AND THE TENDER MERCIES OF KIND OLD GRANDMA
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND KEEP YOUR MUFFLER ROUND YOUR MOUTH GOING OVER THE BRIDGE OR YOU LL BE AS HOARSE AS A CROW TO-MORROW SAID POLLY AS SHE KISSED HER BROTHER WHO RETURNED IT WITHOUT LOOKING AS IF HE THOUGHT IT GIRL'S NONSENSE THEN THE THREE PILED INTO THE SLEIGH AND DROVE OFF LEAVE POLLY NODDING ON THE DOORSTEP
I LL LOOK AT THEM SAID POLLY FOLLOWING FANNY INTO THE STORE FEELING RATHER RICH AND IMPORTANT TO BE SHOPPING IN THIS ELEGANT MANNER
WHAT LOVELY EYES WHISPERED FANNY
I LL TROT OUT THE WHOLE LOT AND TOM GLADLY BROUGHT UP HIS FRIENDS WHO ALL ADMIRED POLLY IMMENSELY AND WERE PROUD TO BE CHOSEN INSTEAD OF THE BIG FELLOWS THERE WAS NO SITTING STILL FOR POLLY AFTER THAT FOR THE LADS KEPT HER GOING AT A GREAT PACE
WAITING HAS NOT DONE US ANY HARM AND I LOVE YOU ALL THE BETTER FOR YOUR TRIAL
LET THE CHILD DO IT IF SHE LIKES AND TAKE MAUD WITH HER
YOU NODDED TO ME AFTER SHE D FREED HER MIND AND YOU MEANT TO GO THEN
THIS WILL DO
I VE SOLD MY THINGS TO PAY WHAT I OWE YOU
YOU SEEM TO FIND IT SO AND POLLY LAUGHED WITH A SUDDEN SPARKLE IN HER EYES
I M TIRED SHE SAID AND WALKED AWAY TO MADAM IN THE OTHER ROOM
HAS N'T HE MENTIONED MARIA IN HIS LETTERS ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF JOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
NOW POLLY WAS VERY ANGRY AND I THINK SHE HAD A RIGHT TO BE
I PROMISED I WOULD N'T THAT IS FANNY WILL TELL YOU CRIED POLLY QUITE RED WITH DISTRESS AT THE PREDICAMENT SHE WAS IN
BUT POLLY DID N'T GET A CHANCE TO BE MISERABLE VERY LONG FOR AS SHE WENT UP STAIRS FEELING LIKE THE MOST INJURED GIRL IN THE WORLD SHE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF MISS MILLS SEWING AWAY WITH SUCH A BRIGHT FACE THAT SHE COULD N'T RESIST STOPPING FOR A WORD OR TWO
FOR A MINUTE SHE REGARDED THE PLEASANT PICTURE WHILE VISIONS OF GIRLISH ROMANCES AND TRIUMPHS DANCED THROUGH HER HEAD THEN SHE SHOOK HER HAIR ALL OVER HER FACE AND PUSHED HER CHAIR OUT OF RANGE OF THE MIRROR SAYING WITH A DROLL MIXTURE OF SELF-REPROACH AND SELF-APPROVAL IN HER TONE
FOR HALF AN HOUR WE LAY LAUGHING AND WHISPERING AS WE WAITED FOR THE SIGNAL FROM SALLY
MONEY CAN'T BUY THESE THINGS FOR ME AND I WANT THEM VERY MUCH AS THESE THOUGHTS WERE PASSING THROUGH HER MIND FANNY WAS HEARING ALL SORTS OF TOPICS DISCUSSED WITH FEMININE ENTHUSIASM AND FRANKNESS
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T STIR IT SO WHAT IS THE USE OF TALKING ABOUT IT
AND A THIRD SAVED SUCH OF MR SHAW'S BOOKS AS HE VALUED MOST FOR HE HAD KEPT HIS WORD AND GIVEN UP EVERYTHING WITH THE MOST PUNCTILIOUS INTEGRITY
NOT AN ELEGANT POSTURE BUT THE ONLY ONE IN WHICH HE SAID HE COULD THINK WELL
OUT WENT THE CANDLE AND EACH ONE RUSHED AWAY WITH AS MUCH OF THE FEAST AS SHE COULD SEIZE IN HER HASTE
MERCY ME
I KNEW THE GIRLS DID N'T MEAN HIM CRIED MAUD WITH A CHOP THAT SENT THE CITRON FLYING
OH YOU SLY-BOOTS
WHY HIS FATHER ORDERED HIM ABOUT AS IF HE WAS A BORN REBEL AND TOOK SO LITTLE INTEREST IN HIS ONLY SON
I VE OFTEN TOLD THEM WHAT GOOD TIMES WE HAVE UP HERE AND TEASED THEM TO COME BUT THEY THINK IT S TOO QUIET
NOW WE SHALL BEHOLD BELLE GALLOPING AWAY AT A GREAT PACE ON HER NEW HOBBY
THE YOUNG LADIES CONSENTED AND PUSS IN THE CORNER PROVED A PEACEMAKER
BUT FANNY OBSERVED I LIKE TO READ ABOUT SUCH THINGS
BUT IT DON'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE N'T GOT THE MONEY
YOU BRING THE MACHINE AND I LL PAY YOU PAT AS HE SPOKE TOM SLOWLY PICKED HIMSELF AND STEADYING HIMSELF BY POLLY'S SHOULDER ISSUED COMMANDS AND THE PROCESSION FELL INTO LINE
MERCIFULLY REMOVED DID NOT KNOW THAT THE INVALID'S WEAK IDLE HANDS WERE UNCONSCIOUSLY KEEPING THE SON SAFE IN THAT QUIET ROOM WHERE SHE GAVE HIM ALL THAT SHE HAD TO GIVE MOTHER-LOVE TILL HE TOOK HEART AGAIN AND FACED THE WORLD READY TO FIGHT HIS BATTLES MANFULLY
POLLY HAD GROWN UP BUT SHE HAD NO MORE STYLE NOW THAN IN THE DAYS OF THE ROUND HAT AND ROUGH COAT FOR SHE WAS ALL IN GRAY LIKE A YOUNG QUAKERESS WITH NO ORNAMENT BUT A BLUE BOW AT THE THROAT AND ANOTHER IN THE HAIR
IS NED REALLY ENGAGED TO HER VERY MUCH SO
BUT HE WAS A BUSY MAN SO INTENT ON GETTING RICH THAT HE HAD NO TIME TO ENJOY WHAT HE ALREADY POSSESSED
HE D LAUGH AND SAY POOH IF HE HEARD ME SAY IT BUT IT S TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT HE S A GRAND FELLOW AND HELPED ME THROUGH THE FIRST SIX MONTHS LIKE A WELL A BROTHER AS HE IS
SOMETHING IN HIS FACE MADE POLLY FEEL A LITTLE GUILTY SO SHE FELL TO GRATING NUTMEG WITH A VIGOR WHICH MADE RED CHEEKS THE MOST NATURAL THING IN LIFE
MY SISTER NELLY AND I WENT TO VISIT AN AUNT OF OURS WHEN WE WERE LITTLE GIRLS BUT WE DID N'T HAVE A VERY GOOD TIME FOR SHE WAS EXTREMELY STRICT
I WANT TO KNOW HER
BUT YOU SAID YOU D GO TOO
I HAVE
I HAVE
I HOPE IT MAY TO THE END SAID POLLY HEARTILY AS SHE WATCHED THE LAD TRAMP AWAY WHISTLING AS BLITHELY AS IF HIS PLEASURABLE EMOTIONS MUST FIND A VENT OR ENDANGER THE BUTTONS ON THE ROUND JACKET
DEAR MARY I HAVE BEEN IN TOWN ALMOST A MONTH YET I CANNOT SAY I HAVE FOUND ANYTHING IN LONDON EXTREMELY AGREEABLE
MOST PEOPLE MEETING THEM WOULD HAVE SEEN ONLY AN AWKWARD YOUNG MAN WITH A BOY'S FACE ATOP OF HIS TALL BODY AND A QUIETLY DRESSED FRESH FACED LITTLE WOMAN HANGING ON HIS ARM
POLLY OPENED THE DOOR
I CAN'T GIVE HER MONEY BUT I CAN TEACH HER
NED THE OTHER BROTHER HAS A BUSINESS TALENT AND DON'T CARE FOR BOOKS SO HE HAS GONE OUT WEST AND WILL MAKE HIS OWN WAY ANYWHERE
IS SHE THE WESTERN GIRL
IT WAS LOVELY OF YOU TO COME EARLY
I WANT A HEROINE AND YOU WILL DO SAID KATE
BUT FAN'S NEWS SETTLED THAT POINT AND JUST NOW THE LOOK IN MY POLLY'S FACE SETTLED THE OTHER
SO WAS THE SETTLING OF A MINUTE BIT OF COURT-PLASTER JUST TO THE LEFT OF THE DIMPLE IN HER CHIN AN UNUSUAL PIECE OF COQUETRY IN WHICH POLLY WOULD NOT HAVE INDULGED IF AN ALMOST INVISIBLE SCRATCH HAD NOT GIVEN HER AN EXCUSE FOR DOING IT
DON'T YOU EVER FEEL SO THINGS WORRY ME SOMETIMES BUT I JUST CATCH UP A BROOM AND SWEEP OR WASH HARD OR WALK OR GO AT SOMETHING WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND I USUALLY FIND THAT BY THE TIME I GET THROUGH THE WORRY IS GONE OR I VE GOT COURAGE ENOUGH TO BEAR IT WITHOUT GRUMBLING ANSWERED POLLY CUTTING THE BROWN LOAF ENERGETICALLY
TOM JUST SAT AND LOOKED AT POLLY AS IF HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE WINTER OF HIS DISCONTENT HAD ENDED IN THIS GLORIOUS SPRING
HOW QUEER MY HEAD FEELS
WHEN SHE LOOKED UP HER FACE WORE AN EXPRESSION WHICH NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN ON IT BEFORE
LET HER BE
SLEEP LIKE AN ANGEL AND DON'T DREAM OF I FORGOT NO TEASING ALLOWED AND TOM TOOK HIMSELF OFF WITH A THEATRICAL FAREWELL
THE CHILD HAS TALENT LOVES MUSIC AND NEEDS HELP
HE TOOK MISS MILTON DOWN OF COURSE PUT HER IN A CORNER AND HAVING SERVED HER TO A DAB OF ICE AND ONE MACAROON HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO HIS OWN SUPPER WITH SUCH INTEREST THAT POLLY WOULD HAVE FARED BADLY IF TOM HAD NOT COME AND RESCUED HER
YOU NEVER TOLD US SO I SUPPOSE YOU DID N'T KNOW IT
HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS CRIED FANNY STARING AT IT WITH INCREASED RESPECT
IT S BEAUTIFUL TO HEAR EM PLAN IT ALL OUT ANY MORE GOSSIP TO RETAIL PUG ASKED TOM A MINUTE AFTER AS MAUD SEEMED ABSORBED IN VISIONS OF THE FUTURE
POLLY MUST HAVE SOME
SO POLLY TOOK THE HINT AND WENT AWAY REJOICING IN THE THOUGHT OF THE UNKNOWN TREASURES SHE WAS TO CARRY HOME
THEY ARE ALL ALONE IN THE WORLD BUT AS HAPPY AND INDEPENDENT AS BIRDS
WHAT SHALL WE DO SAID NELLY
HE GOT HURT COASTING LAST WINTER
OH DEAR
OH DEAR
OH DEAR
OH DEAR
POLLY INSTANTLY DECIDED THAT SHE WOULD N'T BORROW BECKY'S BEST BONNET AS SHE AT FIRST INTENDED BUT GET A NEW ONE FOR IN HER PRESENT EXCITED STATE NO EXTRAVAGANCE SEEMED TOO PRODIGAL IN HONOR OF THIS GRAND OCCASION
WELL THAT S ALL FAIR
SO ROMANCERS HAD BETTER LET IMAGINATION PAINT FOR THEM THAT WHICH IS ABOVE ALL ART AND LEAVE THEIR LOVERS TO THEMSELVES DURING THE HAPPIEST MINUTES OF THEIR LIVES
YOU ARE A TRUMP POLLY WHISPERED TOM
NOW POLLY DEAR WHAT WILL YOU HAVE SAID GRANDMA LOOKING SO LIVELY AND HAPPY THAT IT WAS VERY EVIDENT REMINISCING DID HER GOOD
IT RESTS HIM AFTER STUDYING SO HARD SHE SAYS
IT S NO USE I CAN'T STAND IT AND TOM'S HEAD WENT DOWN AGAIN WITH SOMETHING VERY LIKE A SOB THAT WOULD COME IN SPITE OF MANFUL EFFORTS TO KEEP IT BACK FOR THE POOR FELLOW HAD THE WARMEST HEART THAT EVER WAS AND ALL THE FINE WAISTCOATS OUTSIDE COULD N'T SPOIL IT
I NEVER HAD MUCH FAITH IN THE REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE OF HIS ALWAYS HAPPENING HOME TO DINNER JUST AS I GO TO GIVE THE ROTHS THEIR LESSON
SHE DID HER BEST BUT I M A BAD LOT SAID TOM WITH A SHAKE OF THE HEAD AND A SOBER FACE
SHE WOULD N'T GO SLEIGH-RIDING THOUGH MR FRANK TEASED AND SHE WANTED TO EVER SO MUCH
MASTER'S AN OLD FIDGET TO SEND ME TRAVELLING UP AGAIN JUST BECAUSE HE FANCIED HE SAW SOMETHING AMISS AT THE WINDOW
SO YOU ARE AFRAID OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN HEY AND MR SHAW HELD HER BY ONE CURL
SUCH SUCCESSFUL RAIDS INTO THE DINING-ROOM AND KITCHEN
OH POLLY WHEN HE SAID THAT I COULD N'T BEAR IT BECAUSE IN SPITE OF ALL MY TRYING I M STILL SO WEAK AND POOR AND SILLY WE DON'T THINK SO
I SCOLDED HIM WELL AND HE PROMISED TO MAKE UP WITH HER
WELL I D PUT YOU THROUGH AS SURE AS MY NAME S TOM SHAW
I HOPE HE LL REMEMBER THAT HIS FRIENDS WILL BE VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED IF HE IS
I BEGAN FIRST AND I VE WORN THEM LONGEST AS SHE SPOKE POLLY DREW OUT THE OLD LOCKET OPENED IT AND SHOWED THE PICTURE TOM GAVE HER IN THE BAG OF PEANUTS CUT SMALL AND FITTED IN ON ONE SIDE ON THE OTHER WAS A CURL OF REDDISH HAIR AND A BLACK BUTTON
I DON'T THINK I CAN LIKE ANYTHING TILL I KNOW WHAT THE MATTER IS ANSWERED MAUD
TO FIND HIS SLIPPERS READY HIS PAPER IN ITS PLACE AND A PAIR OF WILLING FEET EAGER TO WAIT UPON HIM
MAKE HIM STOP WHAT DID YOU DO TO SET HIM GOING
THE PLAIN ONE WHO DID N'T SAY MUCH
THE LEAST OF US HAVE SOME INFLUENCE IN THIS BIG WORLD
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF MY DEAR TOM LAUGHED AND WAS ABOUT TO PINCH THE MUCH ENDURING LITTLE NOSE
LOVE WOULD DO SO MUCH TOWARD MAKING HER WHAT SHE MIGHT BE
MAUD HAPPENED TO BE PLAYING A REDOWA UP IN THE PARLOR AND POLLY CAME PRANCING INTO THE ROOM SO EVIDENTLY SPOILING FOR A DANCE THAT TOM WHO WAS THERE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST CATCHING HER ABOUT THE WAIST AND PUTTING HER THROUGH THE MOST INTRICATE EVOLUTIONS TILL MAUD'S FINGERS GAVE OUT
AND A FOURTH YOUNG GOSSIP ASSURED THE COMPANY THAT A CERTAIN PERSON NEVER HAD OFFERED HIMSELF TO A CERTAIN OTHER PERSON THOUGH THE REPORT WAS INDUSTRIOUSLY SPREAD BY INTERESTED PARTIES
I DID USE TO THINK YOU WERE AN AWFUL BOY BUT SEEMS TO ME I RATHER LIKED IT SHE HAD SO MUCH OF IT AT HOME SHE GOT USED TO IT PUT IN WILL PULLING THE LITTLE CURL BEHIND POLLY'S EAR
NO WELL THERE HE IS MODERNIZED AND TURNING THE FAN SHE SHOWED HIM HIMSELF
I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT AND POLLY LET HER THOUGHTS REVEL IN THE LUXURIOUS FUTURE HER FANCY PAINTED
THE EASY-CHAIR WAS EMPTY NOW THE KIND OLD FACE WAS GONE AND NOTHING BUT A VERY TENDER MEMORY REMAINED
I DON'T WANT HER TO FEEL DEPENDENT AND UNHAPPY AND A LITTLE WELL-PAID SEWING WOULD BE ALL SHE NEEDS TO DO NICELY
I BELIEVE HALF OF THEM ARE HUMBUGS AND IF WE LET THEM ALONE THEY D GO TO WORK AND TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
JUST AS I BEGAN TO POUR DEBBY SUDDENLY CALLED FROM THE TOP OF THE STAIRS CHILDREN WHAT UNDER THE SUN ARE YOU DOING IT STARTLED US BOTH
HOPE THE FELLOWS CAME CRIED TOM CHARMED WITH THIS OPENING
SO CONVENIENT YOU SEE AND YET OUT OF THE WAY IN THE DAYTIME FOR TWO OR THREE OF MY PUPILS COME TO ME EXPLAINED POLLY
THE PLEASURE THAT LETTER WILL GIVE YOU MAY MAKE UP FOR MY BORING YOU AS HE SPOKE TOM LAID THE OTHER PAPER IN HER LAP AND WENT OFF TO THE WINDOW AS IF TO LEAVE HER FREE TO ENJOY IT UNSEEN
IT S ONLY MAUD
POLLY FOUND THIS OUT AS HER LIFE SLOWLY GREW EASIER AND BRIGHTER AND THE BEAUTIFUL LAW OF COMPENSATION GAVE HER BETTER PURPOSES AND PLEASURES THAN ANY SHE HAD LOST
HOW DARE YOU CRIED POLLY GROWING MUCH REDDER THAN HER ROSE
GOOD-BY POLLY
I HOPE IT IS N'T VERY WICKED BUT THERE DON'T SEEM ANY ROOM FOR ME IN THE WORLD AND I M NOT AFRAID TO DIE NOW THOUGH I SHOULD BE IF I STAYED AND GOT BAD BECAUSE I HAD N'T STRENGTH TO KEEP RIGHT
SO I SEND ONE THAT MY MOTHER GAVE ME YEARS AGO
DOWN STAIRS SEEING COMPANY WHY DID N'T YOU GO TOO I DON'T LIKE TRIX AND I DON'T KNOW HER FINE NEW YORK FRIENDS DON'T WANT TO NEITHER WHY DON'T YOU SAY NOT POLITE WHO CARES
FOR SHE HAD LAUGHED AT HER FRIEND HAD SLIGHTED HER SOMETIMES AND BEEN UNFORGIVING FOR AN INNOCENT OFFENCE
I PERFECTLY TREMBLED EVERY TIME YOU OPENED YOUR MOUTH FOR FEAR YOU D ASK SOME QUESTION ABOUT IT
YOU LL PROBABLY FIND THEM IN THE COAL-BIN SAID POLLY WITH THE CALMNESS OF DESPAIR
I M QUITE AS PROUD OF IT NOW AS I WAS THEN FOR HE WAS A BRAVE GOOD MAN AND HELPED US IN OUR TROUBLE
I D LIKE TO DO IT TRULY MR SHAW'S OTHER ARM WENT ROUND THE CHILD AND FOR A MINUTE NO ONE SAID ANYTHING FOR POLLY HAD SLIPPED BEHIND HIS CHAIR THAT NOTHING SHOULD DISTURB THE THREE WHO WERE LEARNING FROM MISFORTUNE HOW MUCH THEY LOVED ONE ANOTHER
HURRAH FOR COL
I M STRONGER THAN YOU ARE
I CAN'T DO THOSE THINGS YOU KNOW
POLLY REGARDED THESE NOBLE BEINGS WITH AWE AND THEY RECOGNIZED HER EXISTENCE WITH THE CONDESCENSION OF THEIR SEX
FANNY HAD BEEN TO MANY ELEGANT LUNCHES BUT NEVER ENJOYED ONE MORE THAN THAT DROLL PICNIC IN THE STUDIO
YOU NEED N'T MIND THAT
GOING TO SET HER CAP FOR SOME YOUNG MINISTER AND MARRY HIM IN THE SPRING ADDED MRS SHAW WHOSE MIND RAN A GOOD DEAL UPON MATCH-MAKING JUST NOW
I MET HIM YESTERDAY AND HE TREATED ME LIKE A MAN AND A BROTHER HE ADDED AS IF ANXIOUS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PLEASURES OF THE HOUR
I LIKE IT SAID POLLY
POLLY'S HOPES OF MRS SHAW WERE DISAPPOINTED FOR MISFORTUNE DID NOT HAVE A BRACING EFFECT
LOOK HERE YOU ARE LETTING CATS OUT OF THE BAG
BUT I M UP AGAIN AND STEADIER THAN EVER
BUT THE PICTURES ARE SO FUNNY EAGER TO DISPLAY HER FRIEND'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS MAUD PULLED OUT A FAT LITTLE BOOK MARKED POLLY'S JOURNAL AND SPREAD IT IN HER LAP
MAMMA'S ASLEEP QUITE WORN OUT POOR DEAR SO WE CAN TALK IN HERE WITHOUT TROUBLING HER SAID FANNY RECEIVING HER FRIEND SO QUIETLY THAT POLLY WAS AMAZED
AND MAUD'S SET HAD RETURNED TO THE LIBRARY TO PLAY
A DOOR CLOSED SOFTLY BELOW AND A STEP CAME CREEPING TOWARDS THE BACK-STAIRS
NO SHE SEEMS TO BE VERY BUSY
FANNY ALSO LENT HER A PAIR OF THREE-BUTTON GLOVES WHICH COMPLETED HER CONTENT AND WHEN TOM GREETED HER WITH AN APPROVING HERE S A SIGHT FOR GODS AND MEN
FOR HIS RED CROP WAS A TENDER POINT AND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH POLLY'S PRETTY BROWN CURLS SEEMED TO LESSEN ITS COPPERY GLOW
MRS SHAW FORGOT HER NERVES AND PUT UP SOME GINGER-BREAD WITH HER OWN HANDS
TELL HER NOT TO WEAR BLUE GLOVES ANYWAY SHE KNOWS I HATE EM I VE DONE MY BEST FOR YOUR SAKE TOM BUT SHE IS A PERVERSE CREATURE AND DON'T MIND A WORD I SAY EVEN ABOUT THINGS MUCH MORE OBJECTIONABLE THAN BLUE GLOVES MAUDIE RUN AND BRING ME MY OTHER CIGAR CASE IT S LYING ROUND SOMEWHERE MAUD WENT
AND WHEN YOU ONCE LEARN THAT YOU WON'T COMPLAIN OF ENNUI ANY MORE RETURNED POLLY WHO HAD TAKEN KINDLY THE HARD LESSON WHICH TWENTY YEARS OF CHEERFUL POVERTY HAD TAUGHT HER
WILL GOT VERY ANXIOUS SHE WAS SO QUIET PALE AND SPIRITLESS AND DISTRACTED POOR POLLY BY HIS AFFECTIONATE STUPIDITY TILL SHE COMPLETED HIS BEWILDERMENT BY GETTING CROSS AND SCOLDING HIM
MAUD WAS READY FIRST AND HOLDING UP AN ODDLY SHAPED LINEN BAG WITH A BIG BLUE F EMBROIDERED ON IT DEMANDED HER STORY
I DON'T CARE FOR THE TOAST AND THE KETTLE BUT I DO ENVY YOU YOUR GOOD SPIRITS POLLY SAID FANNY AS THE MERRIMENT SUBSIDED
THE STORM IS OVER BUT IT IS HEAVY WALKING SO YOU LL DRIVE OUT WITH ME OLD MAN SAID TOM WITH A NOD AT WILL
NOT THAT HE HAD GROWN SO VERY MUCH EXCEPT BROADER IN THE SHOULDERS BUT THERE WAS A BRISK GENIAL FREE-AND-EASY AIR ABOUT HIM SUGGESTIVE OF A STIRRING OUT-OF-DOOR LIFE WITH PEOPLE WHO KEPT THEIR EYES WIDE OPEN AND WERE NOT VERY PARTICULAR WHAT THEY DID WITH THEIR ARMS AND LEGS
BUT SHE REJOICED OVER IT AND FELT THAT HER PROPHECY WOULD YET BE FULFILLED
IF POLLY HAD CRIED A LITTLE JUST HERE HE WOULD HAVE YIELDED
IF ONE COULD ONLY MAKE THE SACRIFICE ALL AT ONCE AND DONE WITH IT THEN IT WOULD SEEM EASIER
JUST FOR INFORMATION YOU KNOW THEN I SHALL HAVE SOMETHING TO GO UPON
THESE ARE MY PETS MAUD SHE ADDED PAUSING ON THE THRESHOLD AND BECKONING THE GIRLS TO LOOK IN QUIETLY
SO MUCH TO DO IN THE GREAT BUSY WORLD AND SHE HAD DONE SO LITTLE
IF SHE WOULD HELP ME
IT IS THE HEIGHT OF THE SEASON AND EVERY HOUR IS ENGAGED EITHER IN GOING TO BALLS CONCERTS THEATRES FETES AND CHURCH OR IN PREPARING FOR THEM
HE DID N'T AND FANNY CHATTED ON RAGING INWARDLY OVER HER DISAPPOINTMENT AND WONDERING HOW POLLY COULD BE SO GAY AND SELFISH
BUT SHE FELT THE SAME ANTAGONISM TOWARD POLLY THAT POLLY DID TOWARD HER
YOU ARE AN ANGEL AND I LL NEVER BE SO RUDE AGAIN SHE ADDED AS POLLY'S ARM CAME ROUND HER AND HALF THE SEAT WAS GLADLY OFFERED
BUT HERE I AM AGAIN WORSE THAN EVER FOR LAST QUARTER I DID N'T SAY ANYTHING TO FATHER HE WAS SO BOTHERED BY THE LOSS OF THOSE SHIPS JUST THEN SO THINGS HAVE MOUNTED UP CONFOUNDEDLY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH ALL YOUR MONEY HANGED IF I KNOW CAN'T YOU PAY IT ANYWAY DON'T SEE HOW AS I HAVE N'T A CENT OF MY OWN AND NO WAY OF GETTING IT UNLESS I TRY GAMBLING OH MERCY NO
FOR GENEROUS NATURES LIKE TO FORGIVE AND POLLY ENJOYED THE PETTING AFTER THE INSULT LIKE A VERY HUMAN GIRL
FAN DID N'T TELL ME SHE WAS PRETTY
WHY CHILD I HAVE FRIZZED AND BURNT MY HAIR SO THAT I LOOK LIKE AN OLD MANIAC WITH IT IN ITS NATURAL STATE AND HAVE TO REPAIR DAMAGES AS WELL AS I CAN
MR SYDNEY WAS DANCING
I D RATHER HAVE HIM I M GOING TO TAKE YOU BOTH IN THE CUTTER
I DID N'T MEAN TO DO IT THE FIRST MINUTE BUT LOOK ABOUT ME A LITTLE AND BE SURE SYD WAS ALL RIGHT
I DID N'T KNOW THE BOY HAD SO MUCH GENTLENESS IN HIM
BUT I WON'T TELL LIES FOR ANYBODY CRIED POLLY GETTING EXCITED
HE MET YOU TWO IN THE STREET PRETTY OFTEN AND BEING IN A SENTIMENTAL MOOD HIMSELF GOT UP A ROMANCE FOR YOU AND SYDNEY I M MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM FOR HIS INTEREST BUT IT S QUITE WASTED THANK YOU FAN'S NEXT PROCEEDING GAVE HER FRIEND ANOTHER SURPRISE FOR BEING RATHER ASHAMED OF HERSELF VERY MUCH RELIEVED AND QUITE AT A LOSS WHAT TO SAY SHE TOOK REFUGE IN AN HYSTERICAL FIT OF TEARS WHICH CHANGED POLLY'S ANGER INTO TENDERNESS AT ONCE
PLAYING GRANDMOTHER CHAPTER 18
IT WAS N'T MUCH AND EVIDENTLY LESS SERIOUS THAN MR SHAW EXPECTED
YOU REALLY MUST TALK LESS AND SEW MORE OR OUR SOCIETY WILL BE DISGRACED
THAT FINISHES YOU OFF JUST RIGHT AND IS A VERY PRETTY ATTENTION OF PAPA'S
JACK WAS THE ONLY MAN ABOUT THE PLACE AND HE WAS BARELY THIRTEEN
I M GOING TO WALK AFTER MY LESSONS SO I WISH YOU D WEAR YOUR BEST HAT AND SACK ANSWERED FANNY TRYING TO STICK HER OWN HAT ON AT AN ANGLE WHICH DEFIED ALL THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION
I HAVE N'T TOUCHED ONE THIS EVER SO LONG SAID FANNY LOOKING DOWN WITH A SUPERIOR AIR
TOM LAUGHED AND DREW POLLY CLOSER AS THE CROWD PRESSED SAYING WITH MOCK TENDERNESS
BUT TELL ME ABOUT MARIA
NEVER MIND IF THE CHINA DON'T HOLD OUT
PEOPLE USED TO CALL HIM A FINE BOY AND I FELT SO PROUD TO HEAR IT
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE MANY GIRLS HAD AS MUCH RIGHT TO BE AS I HAD MOST GIRLS DON'T CARE TWO PINS ABOUT THEIR BROTHERS
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE HAVING A QUIET LITTLE FLIRTATION WITH SOMEBODY
AND POLLY PASSED MANY HAPPY HOURS IN THE QUAINT ROOMS LEARNING ALL SORTS OF PRETTY ARTS AND LISTENING TO PLEASANT CHAT NEVER DREAMING HOW MUCH SUNSHINE SHE BROUGHT TO THE SOLITARY OLD LADY
GREAT NEWS GIRLS
I LL DO WHAT I CAN FOR FAN AND NOT STAND BETWEEN HER AND A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS
BUT SOMEHOW THE BABIES DID N'T DO POLLY THE GOOD SHE EXPECTED THOUGH THEY SMILED AT HER FROM THEIR CARRIAGES AND KISSED THEIR CHUBBY HANDS AS SHE PASSED THEM FOR POLLY HAD THE SORT OF FACE THAT BABIES LOVE
POLLY TURNED THE MATTER OVER IN HER MIND AS SHE DRESSED WHILE JENNY PLAYED WAITING MAID LITTLE DREAMING WHAT THIS NEW FRIEND WAS MEANING TO DO FOR HER IF SHE DARED
IT S DREADFUL WICKED OF ME BUT I CAN'T HELP IT SHE SOBBED TO HERSELF IN THE CORNER OF THE CARRIAGE
IT S TIME FOR LUNCH GIRLS AND I BROUGHT MINE ALONG WITH ME IT S SO MUCH JOLLIER TO EAT IN SISTERHOOD
CAN YOU GO WHERE DID N'T YOU GET MY NOTE I DID N'T GO HOME TO DINNER TOM WANTS US TO GO TO THE OPERA TO-NIGHT AND FAN GOT NO FURTHER FOR POLLY UTTERED A CRY OF RAPTURE AND CLASPED HER HANDS
BLESS YOUR LITTLE HEART I ONLY TAKE A BROTHERLY SORT OF INTEREST IN POLLY
WILL MADE A VERSE ONE DAY WHICH WE THOUGHT PRETTY WELL FOR A LITTLE CHAP
SO I DID N'T SAID TOM AS A LAST APPEAL
I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT MY DEAR
DON'T I POLLY BARGAIN OBSERVED TOM WITH AN EYE TO BUSINESS
BUT DON'T IF YOU D RATHER NOT SAID TOM LOWERING HIS ROUGH VOICE RESPECTFULLY
WELL YOU NEED N'T STARE
BUT SOON HE MISSED HER IF SHE DID NOT COME AND FOUND THAT SOMETHING FRESH AND PLEASANT SEEMED TO BRIGHTEN ALL HIS DAY IF A SMALL GRAY-COATED FIGURE WITH AN INTELLIGENT FACE A MERRY VOICE AND A LITTLE HAND SLIPPED CONFIDINGLY INTO HIS WENT WITH HIM THROUGH THE WINTRY PARK
AND HAVING SPLIT THE DETESTED GLOVES IN DRAGGING THEM ON HE NERVED HIMSELF FOR THE EFFORT WALKED UP TO POLLY MADE A STIFF BOW STUCK OUT HIS ELBOW AND SAID SOLEMNLY MAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE MISS MILTON HE DID IT AS MUCH LIKE THE BIG FELLOWS AS HE COULD AND EXPECTED THAT POLLY WOULD BE IMPRESSED
I FEEL RESPONSIBLE YOU KNOW BECAUSE I TOLD YOUR MOTHER I D LOOK AFTER YOU
AND BEING EXILES FROM THE GERMAN GLADLY JOINED IN THE GAMES WHICH SOON WERE LIVELY ENOUGH TO WAKE THE SLEEPIEST
AND I DON'T DO IT NOW MUCH PUT IN MAUD WITH A VIRTUOUS AIR
THEY AIN'T HURT A BIT PROCLAIMED MAUD RESTORING THE LOST TREASURES
AND IF YOU BEHAVE MAYBE I WON'T DO IT AT ALL
ON YOUR HONOR AS AN HONEST GIRL ON MY HONOR AS ANYTHING YOU PLEASE
POLLY SUSPECTED THAT SOME PLEASANT SURPRISE WAS GOING TO BE PUT IN
HAS N'T HE BEEN GOOD AND PATIENT AND DON'T WE ALL LIKE TO PET HIM WHEN HE S CLEVER FAN SAID POLLY WHOSE HEART WAS STILL ACHING FOR HER BROTHER AND READY FOR HIS SAKE TO FIND VIRTUES EVEN IN TORMENTING TOM
LET S PEEK AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING WHISPERED FAN PAUSING AT THE HALF-OPEN DOOR
I M ONE OF YOUR PARISH AND WILL SEE THAT YOU GET YOUR CELERY PUNCTOOAL AS OLD DEACON MORSE USED TO SAY THANK YOU BROTHER MY WANTS IS FEW AND RAVENS SCURSER THAN THEY USED TO BE AS DEAR OLD PARSON MILLER USED TO ANSWER
IS IT GOING TO BE A TEA-PARTY MISS ASKED JENNY AS THE BLACK SILK WENT RUSTLING ON TO HER GREAT ADMIRATION FOR SHE CONSIDERED POLLY A BEAUTY
I SHALL DEPEND ON YOU
DO YOU KNOW I M RATHER DISAPPOINTED IN FANNY FOR SHE DON'T SEEM TO IMPROVE WITH HER YEARS SAID SYDNEY AS IF HE ACCEPTED THE DIVERSION AND WAS GLAD OF IT
AND HOW FAR WOULD MY EARNINGS GO TOWARDS DRESS CARRIAGES AND ALL THE LITTLE EXPENSES WHICH WOULD COME IF I SET UP FOR A YOUNG LADY IN SOCIETY
GIVE US A BOOST PLEASE
I NEVER SLEPT IN A BED WITH CURTAINS BEFORE OR HAD SUCH A FINE TOILET-TABLE AS THIS I M GLAD YOU LIKE IT
WELL I MIGHT DO WORSE
OH I M GOING TO HAVE WILL
BUT WHEN SHE SAW TOM'S FACE POLLY WAS FRIGHTENED FOR THE COLOR HAD ALL GONE OUT OF IT HIS EYES LOOKED STRANGE AND DIZZY AND DROPS OF BLOOD BEGAN TO TRICKLE FROM A GREAT CUT ON HIS FOREHEAD
WELL I CAN'T HELP IT
HE CAN'T BEAR GIRLS SAID FANNY WITH A SUPERIOR AIR
THIS LADY FEELS HER DUTY TO THEM OWNS IT AND DOES IT AS CONSCIENTIOUSLY AS SHE WANTS THEM TO DO THEIRS BY HER
JIM AND I USED TO SAY HORATIUS TOGETHER AND IT WAS SUCH FUN
ANYTHING YOU LIKE MY DEAR
WELL IT WAS DROLL AND I M GLAD I REMEMBERED IT FOR IT S JUST THE STORY TO TELL YOU YOUNG THINGS
THE THOUGHT THAT INSIGNIFICANT AS SHE WAS SHE YET MIGHT DO SOME GOOD MADE HER VERY CAREFUL OF HER ACTS AND WORDS AND SO ANXIOUS TO KEEP HEAD CONTENTED AND FACE HAPPY THAT SHE FORGOT HER CLOTHES AND MADE OTHERS DO THE SAME
BUT IN THE HALL SHE PAUSED A MINUTE TO PEEP INTO THE GLASS AND SEE IF SHE WAS ALL RIGHT FOR SOMEHOW SHE WAS MORE ANXIOUS TO LOOK NEAT AND PRETTY TO TOM IN HIS HOUR OF TROUBLE THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN IN HIS PROSPEROUS DAYS
TAKE OFF YOUR THINGS
OH DID N'T I EVERY WORD AND TOM EXULTED OVER THEM VISIBLY
THEN THE GOOD-NATURED IRISHMAN TRUNDLING THAT DIVIL OF A WHIRLIGIG AS HE DISRESPECTFULLY CALLED THE IDOLIZED VELOCIPEDE
I M SO GLAD OF THAT THEN SHE SAT SILENT BESIDE THE HALF-OPEN DOOR HEARING THE MURMUR OF TOM'S VOICE ACROSS THE HALL AND HOPING WITH ALL HER HEART THAT HE WOULD N'T HAVE A VERY HARD TIME
BUT AFTER A FEW TRIALS POLLY FIRMLY DECLINED EVERYTHING BUT INFORMAL VISITS WHEN THE FAMILY WERE ALONE
IT S ALL RIGHT THEN BUT WHEN A NICE PERSON COMES IT S PART OF THE FUN TO LET HIM GO ON TO THE VERY END WHETHER THE GIRLS CARE FOR HIM OR NOT
SHE OFTEN WONDERED WHY HIS MOTHER DID N'T PET HIM AS SHE DID THE GIRLS
SHE S TO BE STRONG-MINDED IS SHE AND FANNY'S LIP CURLED A LITTLE AS SHE UTTERED THE MISUSED WORDS
NOW WHAT IN THE WORLD HAVE YOU TO FRET ABOUT ASKED POLLY RATHER ANXIOUSLY
SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD FOUND SOMETHING UNCOMMONLY NICE AND HE LOOKS AS IF ALL CREATION WAS GETTING POLLYFIED PRETTY RAPIDLY
THIS NOISY LITTLE CHAP THE BOYS NAMED NICODEMUS
HURRAH AND HERE THE OLD LADY STOPPED OUT OF BREATH WITH HER CAP ASKEW HER SPECTACLES ON THE END OF HER NOSE AND HER KNITTING MUCH THE WORSE FOR BEING WAVED ENTHUSIASTICALLY IN THE AIR WHILE SHE HUNG OVER THE ARM OF HER CHAIR SHRILLY CHEERING AN IMAGINARY LAFAYETTE
WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO LOOK AT THIS SAID FAN HOLDING UP A GRAY STREET SUIT FADED PAST CURE
WHY DID N'T YOU KNOW IT ANSWERED MAUD AS IF IT HAD BEEN AN EVENT OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE
I SHOULD BE AFRAID IF ALL THE GIRLS DRESS AS FINELY AS YOU DO AND KNOW AS MUCH SAID POLLY BEGINNING TO FEEL SHY AT THE THOUGHT
IF POLLY DOES CARRY OUT HER PLAN I WISH MAUD TO TAKE LESSONS OF HER
AND LOOKING ROUND MAUD SAW FANNY IN THE BIG CHAIR COOKING HER FEET OVER THE REGISTER
FAITH AND SHE WOULD
MAUD DEPARTED WITH UNEXPECTED DOCILITY AND POLLY WENT INTO THE DINING-ROOM WHERE TOM WAS WANDERING ABOUT IN A RESTLESS WAY
AT HOME POLLY RAN AND RODE COASTED AND SKATED JUMPED ROPE AND RAKED HAY WORKED IN HER GARDEN AND ROWED HER BOAT
TOM APPARENTLY DID NOT SEE HER FOR HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON A FINE HORSE JUST PRANCING BY
WISH THERE WAS A LITTLE MORE SOMETIMES ADDED TOM THINKING OF SEVERAL BLOOMING DAMSELS WHOSE BESEECHING EYES HAD BEGGED HIM NOT TO LEAVE THEM TO WITHER ON THE PARENT STEM
I ASKED HIM AND HE SAID ALL RIGHT HE S GOING TO PREACH SUNDAYS AND WORK ON THE FARM THE REST OF THE TIME
I CAN DO THE LANCERS TIP-TOP
BUT I DON'T WISH TO TROUBLE YOUR MOTHER BY TELLING OF IT
I SAW HER
YOUNG LADIES WHAT IS THIS UNSEEMLY NOISE NO ANSWER FROM US BUT A FAINT SNORE
I DO BELIEVE IT WAS STOWED IN EVERY PART OF THE WAGON AND NEVER STAID ANYWHERE
GRANDMA'S NAME RECALLED THE TENDER MEMORY THAT ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND THE THOUGHT THAT POLLY TRUSTED HER DEAREST BROTHER TO HIS CARE STIRRED UP A MANFUL DESIRE TO DESERVE THE CONFIDENCE
BUT IN SPITE OF THE SILENCE THE WORK AND THE HURRY I THINK THEY CAME TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER BETTER IN THAT BUSY LITTLE SPACE OF TIME THAN IN ALL THE YEARS THAT HAD GONE BEFORE FOR THE BEST AND BRAVEST IN EACH WAS UP AND STIRRING AND THE SMALL HOUSE WAS AS FULL OF THE MAGNETISM OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP SELF-SACRIFICE AND ENTHUSIASM AS THE WORLD OUTSIDE WAS FULL OF SPRING SUNSHINE AND ENCHANTMENT
THIS LATTER REMARK CAUSED SUCH A CLAMOR THAT FANNY CALLED THE MEETING TO ORDER IN A MOST UNPARLIAMENTARY FASHION
YES AND WHEN GRANDMA WAS ILL HE WAS PERFECTLY DEVOTED
LET MINE COME LAST AND TELL ONE FOR TOM NEXT SAID POLLY LOOKING ROUND AND BECKONING HIM NEARER
I THOUGHT HE D GET ENOUGH OF OUR CANDY LAUGHED POLLY
BUT HE TOOK IT QUIETLY AND LEAVING HIS FACE TO SPEAK FOR HIM MERELY SAID THANKY TOM
FOR WHEN HER MAID LEFT HER TO SEE A FRIEND BELOW MISS MAUD PARADED INTO POLLY'S ROOM AND SOLACED HERSELF WITH MISCHIEF
BUT AT THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART THERE WAS A SORE SPOT STILL AND THE AFTERNOON LESSONS DRAGGED DISMALLY
YET SHE THANKED HIM
BLESS MY BOOTS
ON THE TABLE WAS A BOTTLE HALF FULL OF LAUDANUM AN OLD POCKET-BOOK AND A LETTER
ARE YOU MAD
HE TURNED SCARLET SAID SHORTLY COME BACK POLLY AND WALKED STRAIGHT OUT OF THE ROOM LOOKING AS IF GOING TO INSTANT EXECUTION FOR POOR TOM HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO FEAR HIS FATHER AND HAD NOT ENTIRELY OUTGROWN THE DREAD
AND NOTHING COULD BE NICER CRIED POLLY MAKING A DIVE AMONG THE SILKS FAN WAS TURNING OVER WITH A LOST EXPRESSION
BUT I LIKE TO BE TAKEN AWAY
I ALWAYS LIKED HIM MY DEAR
WHAT IF THEY DO
I M SURE I WANT TO DO MY DUTY BUT IT S SUCH A MUDDLE I DON'T KNOW HOW SAID BELLE
POLLY KNEW ABOUT IT AND ASKED HIM WILL'S A DIG GROWLED TOM SHUTTING HIS EYES AGAIN AS IF NOTHING MORE COULD BE SAID OF THE DELINQUENT WILLIAM
SO AT THE LAST HOP I LET HER ALONE AND HAD A GAY TIME WITH BELLE AND TO-DAY TRIX GAVE IT TO ME HOT AND HEAVY COMING HOME FROM CHURCH IF YOU GO AND ENGAGE YOURSELF TO A GIRL LIKE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT
EVERY ONE PETTED HIM FOR THE DOCTOR SAID THAT IF THE BLOW HAD BEEN AN INCH NEARER THE TEMPLE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FATAL AND THE THOUGHT OF LOSING HIM SO SUDDENLY MADE BLUFF OLD TOM VERY PRECIOUS ALL AT ONCE
JENNY DOES FINE WORK EXQUISITELY AND BEGINS TO FEEL ANXIOUS TO BE EARNING SOMETHING
SHE IS GOING TO GIVE MUSIC LESSONS AND SUPPORT HERSELF SO THAT WILL MAY GO TO COLLEGE
IT S THE LAW OF ATTRACTION DON'T YOU SEE IF FAN LIKES IT I DON'T CARE SHE LOOKS RESIGNED I THINK SHE CERTAINLY DID FOR SHE WAS TALKING AND LAUGHING IN THE GAYEST MANNER WITH FRANK WHILE SYDNEY WAS COVERTLY SURVEYING POLLY AS IF HE DID N'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW THE GRAY GRUB GOT SO SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED INTO A WHITE BUTTERFLY
I VE HAD SO MANY PLANS IN MY HEAD LATELY THAT SOMETIMES IT SEEMS AS IF IT WOULD SPLIT CONTINUED THE POOR FELLOW RUBBING HIS TIRED FOREHEAD AS IF TO POLISH UP HIS WITS
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE STOPPED IF SALLY HAD NOT GOT CHOKED WITH THE NUT SHE HAD IN HER MOUTH AND SO FRIGHTENED US NEARLY OUT OF OUR WITS WHAT BECAME OF THE THINGS AND HOW WERE YOU PUNISHED ASKED FAN IN THE MIDDLE OF HER LAUGHTER
A GENERAL LAMENT AROSE WHEN A CAREFUL RUMMAGE LEFT NO HOPES
IT IS NOT THE FINEST DRESS WHICH DOES THE MOST EXECUTION I FANCY BUT THAT WHICH BEST INTERPRETS INDIVIDUAL TASTE AND CHARACTER
WE SAW A DARK FIGURE APPROACHING AND DRAGGED HER IN WITH MORE BUMPING AND SCRAPING AND EMBRACED HER WITH RAPTURE FOR WE HAD JUST ESCAPED BEING DETECTED BY MR JOHN WHOSE EYES WERE AS SHARP AS HIS EARS WERE DULL
THE LORD OF SURREY WAS THERE A VERY ELEGANT YOUNG MAN WHO SUNG A SONG OF HIS OWN COMPOSITION ON THE LORD OF KILDARE'S DAUGHTER IT WAS MUCH APPROVED AND MY BROTHER WHISPERED ME THAT THE FAIR GERALDINE FOR SO MY LORD OF SURREY CALLS HIS SWEETHEART IS THE FINEST WOMAN OF THE AGE
THE OLD LADY PUT OUT HER HAND AND DRAWING POLLY TO HER KNEE LOOKED INTO HER FACE WITH SUCH KIND EYES THAT POLLY FORGOT THE IMPRESSIVE CAP AND SMILED AT HER CONFIDINGLY
GEORGE KNOWS HE CAN'T HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER AND HAS NOT SUGGESTED SUCH A THING AS PARTING US
THERE HE FOUND POLLY GIVING MAUD LESSONS IN COOKERY
AND THEN THE SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF ENTERED IN AND TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
IT WAS ALTOGETHER AN UNCOMFORTABLE DINNER AND POLLY WAS VERY GLAD WHEN IT WAS OVER
OF COURSE YOU CAN'T
FOR A TIME SHE ENJOYED IT FOR IT WAS ALL NEW TO HER AND THE VARIOUS PRETTY DEVICES WERE VERY CHARMING
A HAPPY SOUL IN A HEALTHY BODY IS A RARE SIGHT IN THESE DAYS WHEN DOCTORS FLOURISH AND EVERY ONE IS ILL AND THIS PLEASANT UNION WAS THE CHARM WHICH POLLY POSSESSED WITHOUT KNOWING IT
AND TOM OWNED THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS KIND DID LIKE HIM AND HAD N'T ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN HIS PROMISE
I HAD A NICE TIME COMING AND NO TROUBLE EXCEPT THE TIPSY COACHMAN
THIS WAS A BLOW FOR THEY HAD JUST BEGUN AND POLLY HAD N'T THE FACE TO SEND IN A BILL FOR A WHOLE QUARTER THOUGH HER PLANS AND CALCULATIONS WERE SADLY DISTURBED BY THE FAILURE OF THAT SUM
SOMETHING DREADFUL MUST HAVE HAPPENED FOR MAMMA AND FAN ARE CRYING TOGETHER UPSTAIRS PAPA IS SHUT UP IN THE LIBRARY AND TOM IS RAGING ROUND LIKE A BEAR IN THE DINING-ROOM I GUESS IT IS N'T ANYTHING VERY BAD
BUT PEOPLE DID N'T SEEM TO MIND IT SO MUCH IN HER AS HER DAY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OVER AND NOTHING WAS EXPECTED OF HER BUT TO KEEP OUT OF EVERYBODY'S WAY AND TO BE HANDSOMELY DRESSED WHEN SHE APPEARED BEFORE PEOPLE GRANDMA LED A QUIET SOLITARY LIFE IN HER OWN ROOMS FULL OF OLD FURNITURE PICTURES BOOKS AND RELICS OF A PAST FOR WHICH NO ONE CARED BUT HERSELF
BECKY ASKED ME TO BRING YOU AGAIN AND SHE SELDOM DOES THAT FOR FASHIONABLE YOUNG LADIES LET ME TELL YOU I WANT TO BE EVER SO MUCH BETTER AND I THINK YOU AND THEY MIGHT SHOW ME HOW SAID FANNY WITH A TRAITOROUS TREMBLE IN HER VOICE
DEAR DEAR
SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OVER BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHAWS FAN DON'T NEED ME AND SYDNEY DON'T CARE WHETHER I COME OR NOT SO I LL KEEP OUT OF THE WAY SHE WOULD SAY AS IF TO EXCUSE HER SEEMING INDOLENCE
IT S ALWAYS SO REFRESHING TO ME TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF THE COUNTRY AS IT WERE ESPECIALLY AT THIS SEASON OH POLLY POLLY WHAT A STUPID SPEECH TO MAKE WHEN YOU HAD JUST GIVEN HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE TIRED OF THE PARK
COME POLLY SHE TOOK THE ARM HE OFFERED HER BUT HER HEART WAS SORE AND ANGRY FOR THAT PHRASE IT S ONLY POLLY HURT HER SADLY
WELL BY-AND-BY THE GENERAL ESCORTED BY THE MAYOR DROVE UP
I WAS VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED WHEN HE CHOSE TRIX AND THE MORE I THOUGHT AND SAW OF IT THE WORSE I FELT FOR TOM WAS TOO GOOD FOR HER AND I HATED TO SEE HER DO SO LITTLE FOR HIM WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE SO MUCH
HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO AND WHEN YOU SPOKE OF ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT WE KNEW YOU MEANT YOUR OWN BUT I DID N'T
YESTERDAY I HEARD YOU TELLING FAN ABOUT YOUR BROTHER NED
LEARN ANOTHER PIECE LIKE THAT AND I LL COME AND HEAR YOU SPEAK IT
IT WAS A PLEASANT LITTLE PICTURE ALL THE PLEASANTER FOR ITS UNCONSCIOUSNESS AND TOM FOUND IT BOTH SUGGESTIVE AND AGREEABLE
HOWEVER THAT S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE
WHY OUR COOK GOT A BONNET JUST LIKE MINE THE MATERIALS WERE CHEAPER BUT THE EFFECT WAS THE SAME AND HAD THE IMPERTINENCE TO WEAR IT BEFORE MY FACE
HOW SLOW THEY WERE TO BE SURE
SUCH DARING ROBBERIES OF JELLY-POTS AND CAKE-BOXES
THE LITTLE SCAMP WAS JUST GOING TO WORRY IT WHEN I GRABBED HIM
IT DID MY HEART GOOD TO HEAR YOU SAY IT FOR I WAS SURE THAT IN TIME YOU WOULD KEEP YOUR WORD
ONE OF THESE ENDED IN A WAY WHICH INFLUENCED HER WHOLE LIFE AND SO WE WILL RECORD IT
A PITEOUS YELP FROM THE LOWER REGIONS AT LAST ANNOUNCED THAT THE THIEF WAS CAPTURED AND TOM APPEARED BEARING SNIP BY THE NAPE OF THE NECK IN ONE HAND AND POLLY'S CHERISHED BONNET IN THE OTHER
DO THE BIDDIES ALL TURN OUT SAINTS IN THAT WELL REGULATED FAMILY ASKED THE IRREPRESSIBLE TRIX
NOW OLD MAN LET US PUD ALONG
AND AS SHE MISSED THE HOME-PETTING GLADLY SHOWED THAT SHE LIKED TO SEE THE QUIET OLD FACE BRIGHTEN AS SHE ENTERED THE SOLITARY ROOM WHERE FEW CHILDREN CAME EXCEPT THE PHANTOMS OF LITTLE SONS AND DAUGHTERS WHO TO THE MOTHERLY HEART THAT LOVED THEM NEVER FADED OR GREW UP
A THIRD CIRCULATED A WHISPER TO THE EFFECT THAT THOUGH MRS BUCKMINSTER WORE A THOUSAND-DOLLAR CLOAK HER BOYS WERE NOT ALLOWED BUT ONE SHEET TO THEIR BEDS
HER EYES SHONE HER FACE GLOWED HER LIPS SMILED AND THE BROWN CURLS WAVED IN THE AIR AS SHE DANCED WITH A HEART AS LIGHT AS HER FEET
COME OUT AND SEE ME GO IT WHISPERED TOM TO POLLY AFTER THREE DAYS PRACTICE IN THE STREET FOR HE HAD ALREADY LEARNED TO RIDE IN THE RINK
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WITH YOURSELF LATELY ASKED FANNY COMPOSING HERSELF WITH HER BACK TOWARD THE RAPIDLY WANING LIGHT
BUT POLLY BEING A TRUE WOMAN ASKED QUESTIONS EVEN WHILE SHE LAUGHED AND CRIED FOR JOY
BUT YOU DO IN MANY LITTLE WAYS
I D TRY TO OUTLIVE IT AND IF I COULD N'T I D TRY TO BE THE BETTER FOR IT
CHAPTER XIX
I M RATHER FOND OF PLUM-CAKE OBSERVED TOM LIKENING HIMSELF TO HERCULES WITH THE DISTAFF AND FINDING HIS EMPLOYMENT PLEASANT IF NOT CLASSICAL
SHE LL PROBABLY BE STANDING ROUND LOOKING FOR US
BY THE WAY I VE GOT SOMEWHERE TWO LETTERS WRITTEN BY TWO YOUNG LADIES ONE IN 1517 AND THE OTHER IN 1868
HOW IVER DID I COME FORNINST THIS SAY IV WATHER JUST CRAPIN IN QUIET AFTHER A BIT IV STHROLL WID MIKE MAHONEY ME OWN B'Y THAT S TO MARRY ME INTIRELY COME SAINT PATRICK'S DAY NIXT WE LAUGHED SO WE COULD HARDLY FISH THE POOR THING UP OR LISTEN WHILE SHE EXPLAINED THAT SHE HAD SLIPPED OUT OF HER WINDOW FOR A WORD WITH MIKE AND FOUND IT FASTENED WHEN SHE WANTED TO COME BACK SO SHE HAD SAT ON THE ROOF TRYING TO DISCOVER THE CAUSE OF THIS MYSTERIOUS BARRING OUT TILL SHE WAS TIRED WHEN SHE PROWLED ROUND THE HOUSE TILL SHE FOUND A CELLAR WINDOW UNFASTENED AFTER ALL OUR CARE AND GOT IN QUITE CLEVERLY SHE THOUGHT
NOW DON'T BE CROSS
BUT AFTER AN INTERVAL OF DESPAIR SHE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS THE BEST THING HER MOTHER COULD HAVE DONE AND WITH SOMETHING OF HER FATHER'S ENERGY FANNY SHOULDERED THE NEW BURDEN FEELING THAT AT LAST NECESSITY HAD GIVEN HER WHAT SHE HAD LONG NEEDED SOMETHING TO DO
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT HISTORY DON'T YOU ASKED MAUD SUDDENLY
SHE HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT AND HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO SEE THE BIG BOYS AS SHE CALLED MR FRANK AND HIS FRIENDS WITH THE GIRLS ON ALL OCCASIONS
SHE DOES DRAW WELL SAID TOM LOOKING CRITICALLY AT THE SKETCH OF A BOY WITH A PLEASANT FACE ROUND WHOM POLLY HAD DRAWN RAYS LIKE THE SUN AND UNDER WHICH WAS WRITTEN MY DEAR JIMMY YOU WOULD N'T ADMIRE HER IF YOU KNEW WHAT SHE WROTE HERE ABOUT YOU SAID FANNY WHOSE EYES HAD STRAYED TO THE WRITTEN PAGE OPPOSITE AND LINGERED THERE LONG ENOUGH TO READ SOMETHING THAT EXCITED HER CURIOSITY
WHO IS IT SHE CRIED SO LOUD THAT POLLY WOKE
ONE CANNOT LIVE ON FRENCH COOKERY WITHOUT DYSPEPSIA AND ONE CAN GET NOTHING SIMPLE HERE FOR FOOD LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IS REGULATED BY THE FASHION
BUT NED GOT JEALOUS AND THEN I KNEW THAT HE WAS IN EARNEST SO I LEFT HIM A CLEAR FIELD AND PROMISED NOT TO BREATHE A WORD TO ANY ONE TILL HE HAD GOT A YES OR NO FROM HIS MARIA I WISH I D KNOWN IT SIGHED POLLY
IT S TOM CRIED FANNY
THE ROUGH-AND-READY TRAVELLING SUIT STOUT BOOTS BROWN FACE AND MANLY BEARD CHANGED HIM SO MUCH THAT POLLY COULD FIND SCARCELY A TRACE OF ELEGANT TOM SHAW IN THE HEARTY-LOOKING YOUNG MAN WHO STOOD WITH ONE FOOT ON A CHAIR WHILE HE TALKED BUSINESS TO HIS FATHER IN A SENSIBLE WAY WHICH DELIGHTED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
POLLY HAD A QUIET SUMMER AT HOME RESTING AND GETTING READY IN MIND AND BODY FOR ANOTHER WINTER'S WORK FOR IN THE AUTUMN SHE TRIED HER PLAN AGAIN TO THE SATISFACTION OF HER PUPILS AND THE GREAT JOY OF HER FRIENDS
IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MR SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE-FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
NO I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE SHE SAID SLOWLY
BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHOULD N'T HAVE SECRETS FROM EACH OTHER WE NEVER WILL AGAIN
THE BOUQUET LAY ON THE TABLE AND BESIDE IT A NOTE DIRECTED TO FRANK MOORE ESQ IN A VERY DECIDED HAND WITH A FIERCE-LOOKING FLOURISH AFTER THE ESQ POINTING TO THIS IMPRESSIVE EPISTLE MR SHAW SAID KNITTING HIS BLACK EYEBROWS AS HE LOOKED AT FANNY I M GOING TO PUT A STOP TO THIS NONSENSE AT ONCE
I WISH I D MET YOU I D HAVE GIVEN YOU THREE CHEERS AND A TIGER FOR IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN IMPOSING SPECTACLE SAID TOM
HOW DREADFUL CRIED POLLY
FANNY DID N'T SEEM INCLINED TO TALK MUCH AND TOM WOULD GO ON IN SUCH A RIDICULOUS MANNER THAT POLLY TOLD HIM SHE WOULD N'T LISTEN AND BEGAN TO HUM BITS OF THE OPERA
OH TOM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ASKING ME TO-NIGHT
IF I DON'T LOVE HIM I OUGHT NOT TO MARRY HIM ESPECIALLY WHEN I DO LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE THOUGH EVERYTHING IS AGAINST ME IF SHE HAD READ AS MANY FRENCH NOVELS AS SOME YOUNG LADIES SHE MIGHT HAVE CONSIDERED IT INTERESTING TO MARRY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SUFFER A SECRET ANGUISH TO MAKE HER A ROMANTIC VICTIM
CHAPTER XVII
NOW TOM'S HORSE AND SLEIGH WERE IN THE STABLE FOR HE MEANT TO DRIVE OUT TO COLLEGE THAT EVENING BUT HE DID N'T TAKE MAUD'S HINT
WHAT A STIR IT WOULD MAKE AND WHAT FUN IT WOULD BE TO SEE THE FACES OF THE GIRLS WHEN IT CAME OUT
ONE TEMPTATION POLLY HAD ALREADY YIELDED TO BEFORE THE LETTER CAME AND REPENTED HEARTILY OF AFTERWARD
I FEEL SO ALREADY FOR I DON'T GET HALF THE ATTENTION I USED TO HAVE AND THE OTHER NIGHT I HEARD MAUD AND GRACE WONDERING WHY THOSE OLD GIRLS DID N'T STAY AT HOME AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE HOW IS MAUDIE PRETTY WELL BUT SHE WORRIES ME BY HER QUEER TASTES AND NOTIONS
MY COUSINS AND FRIENDS LAVISH LOVELY THINGS UPON ME AND YOU WILL OPEN YOUR UNSOPHISTICATED EYES WHEN I DISPLAY MY SILKS AND LACES TRINKETS AND FRENCH HATS NOT TO MENTION BILLET DEUX PHOTOGRAPHS AND OTHER RELICS OF A YOUNG BELLE'S FIRST SEASON
WELL I LL TAKE HER
PRESENTLY MAUD EMERGED FROM HER NEW CLOSET BRINGING A SOMEWHAT STARTLING IDEA WITH HER
BUT IT WON'T DO MA'AM
THERE WAS NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO BACK UP A SHIFTLESS PARTY LIKE ME YET HE DID AND MADE MANY THINGS EASY AND SAFE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONFOUNDEDLY HARD AND DANGEROUS IF I D BEEN LEFT TO MYSELF
YOUNG MEN OFTEN LAUGH AT THE SENSIBLE GIRLS WHOM THEY SECRETLY RESPECT AND AFFECT TO ADMIRE THE SILLY ONES WHOM THEY SECRETLY DESPISE BECAUSE EARNESTNESS INTELLIGENCE AND WOMANLY DIGNITY ARE NOT THE FASHION
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT YOU ARE SO GOOD AND HE S SUCH A WILD BOY I CAN'T BELIEVE IT BUT IT IS SO DEAR OF YOU TO CARE FOR HIM COULD N'T HELP IT TRIED NOT TO BUT IT WAS SO HARD YOU KNOW FAN YOU KNOW SAID A STIFLED VOICE FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE VERY FUZZY CUSHION WHICH TOM HAD ONCE CONDEMNED
SO NELLY GOT A BOWL AND I GOT A TOWEL AND LIFTED THE BIG SAUCEPAN CAREFULLY OFF
HOW NICE IT IS EXCLAIMED MAUD AS SHE EMERGED FROM THE BIG CLOSET WHERE POLLY KEPT HER STORES
LOVE SCENES IF GENUINE ARE INDESCRIBABLE
O FAN DON'T IT LOOKS HORRIDLY SO CRIED POLLY LONGING TO ADD A LITTLE BEAUTY TO HER FRIEND'S SALLOW FACE BY A GRACEFUL ADJUSTMENT OF THE FLOWERS
NO I SAID TO MYSELF POLLY OUGHT TO HAVE THE BEST
HE HAD HEARD THE OPERA MANY TIMES BUT IT HAD NEVER SEEMED SO FINE BEFORE PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO HAVE HAD AN INGENUOUS YOUNG FACE SO NEAR HIM IN WHICH THE VARYING EMOTIONS BORN OF THE MUSIC AND THE ROMANCE IT PORTRAYED CAME AND WENT SO ELOQUENTLY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP READING THEM
OUR AUNT HANCOCK LIVED IN THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSE ON BEACON HILL AT THAT TIME HERE THE OLD LADY BRIDLED UP STILL MORE FOR SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF OUR AUNT AH MY DEARS THOSE WERE THE GOOD OLD TIMES SHE CONTINUED WITH A SIGH
GIRLS DO YOU KNOW THAT CARRIE HAS GONE ABROAD
SOME SAID THAT CERTAIN HOUSES WERE MARKED WITH A BLACK CROSS AND THOSE WERE ALWAYS ROBBED
POLLY S MAD
NOW PUT ON YOUR GLOVES AND GO AND ASK POLLY LIKE A GENTLEMAN OH THUNDER MUTTERED TOM
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT SUCH MATTERS BUT I VE SEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE FAILED AND THEY SEEMED JUST AS COMFORTABLE AS BEFORE SAID POLLY
WILL YOU IF I PROMISE NEVER NEVER TO DO SO ANY MORE ASKED FANNY MEEKLY
TOO BAD OF FAN TO MAKE ME COME ALONE THOUGHT TOM AS HE STOOD WATCHING THE CROWD STREAM THROUGH THE DEPOT AND FEELING RATHER DAUNTED AT THE ARRAY OF YOUNG LADIES WHO PASSED
POOR OLD FAN SHE DON'T GET MUCH PETTING
THE BALL DRESSES HAD BETTER BE PUT NICELY AWAY TILL NEXT YEAR BEGAN POLLY COMING TO A RAINBOW COLORED HEAP
THEY ALL THINK A GREAT DEAL OF HIM BECAUSE HE IS SO HARD TO PLEASE AND ALMOST ANY OF THEM WOULD FEEL IMMENSELY FLATTERED IF HE LIKED THEM WHETHER THEY CHOSE TO MARRY HIM OR NOT
JUST HEAR THAT GIRL TALK ABOUT ECONOMY
TOM MADE LUDICROUSLY UNBUSINESS-LIKE PROPOSITIONS
FANNY WAS ABOUT TO SAY I LL CHOOSE AGAIN WHEN GRANDMA BEGAN TO LAUGH SO HEARTILY THAT THE GIRLS FELT SURE SHE HAD CAUGHT SOME MERRY OLD MEMORY WHICH WOULD AMUSE THEM
YOU AND I DON'T MIND DAMPNESS
SOME OF MAUD'S CAST-OFF TOYS HAD BEEN NEATLY MENDED FOR KITTY
FOR A FEW MINUTES NO ONE SPOKE TOM WHISTLED AND MAUD HUMMED BUT FAN AND POLLY WERE EACH SOBERLY THINKING OF SOMETHING FOR THEY HAD REACHED AN AGE WHEN CHILDREN GIRLS ESPECIALLY BEGIN TO OBSERVE CONTRAST AND SPECULATE UPON THE WORDS ACTS MANNERS AND LOOKS OF THOSE ABOUT THEM
AS REPORTERS FLOURISH IN THIS COUNTRY OF COURSE TOM SOON HEARD ALL THE FRIENDLY CRITICISMS PASSED UPON HIM AND HIS CAREER AND HE SUFFERED MORE THAN ANYBODY GUESSED
I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT CRIED POLLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
I SHOULD N'T THINK YOU D MAKE HIM LAUGH WHEN HE S ALWAYS MAKING YOU CWY OBSERVED MAUD WHO HAD JUST COME IN
SLY LITTLE PUSS TO MAKE FUN OF US BEHIND OUR BACKS SAID FAN RATHER NETTLED BY POLLY'S QUIET RETALIATION FOR MANY SLIGHTS FROM HERSELF AND FRIENDS
UP STAIRS I WENT TO A WINDOW OPENING ON THE SHED ROOF
FANNY LIKED IT BECAUSE SHE WAS USED TO IT AND HAD NEVER KNOWN ANYTHING BETTER
OH DO STOP NOW
THOUGHT IT RATHER A GOOD JOKE ON THE WHOLE FOR CHILDREN LIKE NOVELTY AND DON'T CARE MUCH FOR MRS GRUNDY
MISS PERKINS THAWED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT SOMETHING GLITTERED ON HER HAND AS SHE BENT OVER THE PINK PINAFORE AGAIN BETTER AND BRIGHTER THAN HER BIGGEST DIAMOND
DO YOU THINK SHE WILL WHISPERED MAUD WITH THE WISTFUL LOOK SO OFTEN SEEN ON HER LITTLE PLAIN FACE
LET HER WORK FOR YOU IN RETURN FOR THIS
HONORED OUR PARENTS
BUT I WOULD N'T MISS CHRISTMAS AT HOME FOR ANYTHING
ARE N'T THEY LOVELY
SHE WAS RATHER IMPRESSED BY THE ELEGANCE ABOUT HER NEVER HAVING SEEN FANNY'S HOME BEFORE AS THEY GOT ACQUAINTED WHILE FANNY PAID A VISIT TO A FRIEND WHO LIVED NEAR POLLY
AND PERHAPS MY LITTLE GIRL CAN DO SOME GOOD BY SHOWING OTHERS THAT A CONTENTED HEART AND A HAPPY FACE ARE BETTER ORNAMENTS THAN ANY PARIS CAN GIVE HER
YOU KNOW WE BOTH WERE DREADFULLY RUDE TO POLLY AND AGREED THAT WE D BE AS KIND AND CIVIL TO HER AS EVER WE COULD
HONESTLY NOW WOULD N'T YOU GO THE OLD WAY AND ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS EVER IF I WAS N'T ANYWHERE ABOUT TO SET THE BUSYBODIES GOSSIPING YES SAID POLLY BEFORE SHE COULD STOP HERSELF AND THEN COULD HAVE BITTEN HER TONGUE OUT FOR BEING SO RUDE
POLLY LISTENED WITH INTEREST WHILE SHE SEWED DILIGENTLY OCCASIONALLY PERMITTING HER EYES TO STUDY THE ELEGANT INTRICACIES OF MISS PERKINS DRESS FOR THAT YOUNG LADY SAT LIKE A STATUE QUIRKING HER DELICATE FINGERS AND ACCOMPLISHING ABOUT TWO STITCHES A MINUTE
I M AFRAID IT S TOO GAY SAID POLLY WITH A DUBIOUS LOOK
BUT WHEN THE TIME CAME SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED
OH YOU VILLAIN
BLESS MY HEART I HAVE N'T THOUGHT OF THAT FROLIC THIS FORTY YEARS
AND AS I CAN'T HAVE EM IT S LUCKY I M GOING HOME TOMORROW OH DEAR
LET TOM AMUSE HER AND LED HIM ON TILL THE POOR FELLOW LOST HIS WITS AND FINDING HER CRYING ONE DAY ABOUT HER HAT WHICH WAS N'T BECOMING HE THOUGHT SHE WAS MOURNING FOR MR BANKS AND SO TO COMFORT HER THE GOOSE PROPOSED
I M AS STEADY AS A CLOCK AN ORNAMENT TO MY CLASS AND A MODEL YOUNG MAN AIN'T I MOTHER AND TOM PATTED HER THIN CHEEK WITH A CARESSING HAND SURE OF ONE FIRM FRIEND IN HER
IN THE MIDST OF BELLE'S STORY A MORE EXCITING BIT OF GOSSIP CAUGHT HER EAR AND SHE PLUNGED INTO THE CONVERSATION GOING ON ACROSS THE TABLE LEAVING POLLY FREE TO LISTEN AND ADMIRE THE WIT WISDOM AND CHARITABLE SPIRIT OF THE ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG LADIES ABOUT HER
BUT POLLY STOOD STILL AND HER EYES WENT FROM FACE TO FACE WITH AN ANXIOUS WISTFUL AIR WHICH SEEMED TO SAY I KNOW I M NOT RIGHT
POLLY COULD N'T GET ON WITH HER AT FIRST FOR MAUD DID N'T SEEM LIKE A CHILD AND OFTEN CORRECTED POLLY IN HER CONVERSATION AND MANNERS THOUGH LITTLE MADEMOISELLE'S OWN WERE ANYTHING BUT PERFECT
POLLY NAMED HER LIST AND TOOK A SECRET SATISFACTION IN SEEING THE IMPRESSION WHICH CERTAIN NAMES MADE UPON HER HEARERS
I JUST WISH I HAD A SISTER LIKE YOU HE BROKE OUT ALL OF A SUDDEN
IT WOULD TAKE A POLICEMAN TO DO THAT TRIX OR A LITTLE MAN IN A TALL HAT SAID FANNY SLYLY WHICH CAUSED A GENERAL LAUGH AND MADE BEATRICE TOSS HER HEAD COQUETTISHLY
LAST NIGHT I WATCHED WITH POOR MARY FLOYD
BEFORE SHE LEFT HOME SHE THOUGHT HER NEW WHITE MUSLIN DRESS WITH ITS FRESH BLUE RIBBONS THE MOST ELEGANT AND PROPER COSTUME SHE COULD HAVE
YOU CAN TURN YOUR HAND TO ANYTHING YOU CLEVER GIRL SO DO COME AND GIVE ME SOME ADVICE FOR I AM IN THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR SAID FANNY WHEN THE MAID-OF-ALL-WORK AS POLLY CALLED HERSELF FOUND A LEISURE HOUR
OUR LITTLE GIRL WAS TOO INNOCENT TO UNDERSTAND HALF THE JOKES AND OFTEN WONDERED WHAT PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AT
SCRAPES AFTER BEING UNUSUALLY GOOD CHILDREN ARE APT TO TURN SHORT ROUND AND REFRESH THEMSELVES BY ACTING LIKE SANCHO
WOULD YOU
BUT YOU NEED N'T HIT A MAN WHEN HE S DOWN MUTTERED TOM TO HIMSELF FEELING EVERY MOMENT A STRONGER DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING THAT SHOULD SILENCE EVERYBODY
IN WHAT
GIVE THE LITTLE DEAR A GOOD WALTZ AND WE WILL LOOK ON ANSWERED MR SYDNEY WITH A NOD AND SMILE
THAT NIGHT SHE SAW ONE OF THE NEW SPECTACLES WHICH HAVE LATELY BECOME THE RAGE AND RUN FOR HUNDREDS OF NIGHTS DAZZLING EXCITING AND DEMORALIZING THE SPECTATOR BY EVERY ALLUREMENT FRENCH INGENUITY CAN INVENT AND AMERICAN PRODIGALITY EXECUTE
AND WE PITCH INTO THE FOLKS PASSING BY AND GO OUT AND BRING HOME PLUNDER
WHAT RUBBISH SAID FANNY
DEAR ME I SEE HIM NOW
IF HE HAD N'T PLAGUED US SO WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A NICE TIME UNBOLTING THE CELLAR DOOR THE GIRLS ANNOUNCED TO THE INVISIBLE CAPTIVE THAT THEY WERE THROUGH AND THEN DEPARTED MUCH DEPRESSED
STILL AT THE SOUTH
WE ARE AWFUL BUSY
I LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU IF YOU DO
I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER FOR I HEAR SHE IS GOOD AS SHE IS BEAUTIFUL
OF COURSE IT WAS VERY WICKED BUT I MUST TELL THE TRUTH
BUT MISS MILLS IS HEAD TEACHER SHE INSTRUCTS IN GOOD WORKS
HER EYES WERE AS BIG AS SAUCERS HER FACE AS RED AS MY SASH AND ONCE I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO CRY
NO DO YOU GO AS USUAL YES WELL IT S A MYSTERY TO ME HOW YOU GET THERE AS MUCH AS IT IS TO ME HOW YOU GOT HERE SO SUDDENLY I SAW YOU FROM THE SHAWS WINDOW AND TOOK THE LIBERTY OF RUNNING AFTER YOU BY THE BACK STREET HE SAID LAUGHING
I MUST HAVE PUT EM IN BY MISTAKE AND ATE UP THE MEATS WITHOUT THINKING SAID TOM TRYING TO CONCEAL HIS NAUGHTY SATISFACTION AS THE GIRLS HUNG OVER THE PAN WITH FACES FULL OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND DESPAIR
ASK POLLY
PAPA IS FUSSY AND GRANDMA MAKES A STIR ABOUT EVERY BLESSED THING I DO
I LIKE YOUR FRIENDS VERY MUCH POLLY
IT WAS COLD
SHE HAD NO INTENTION OF DYING TILL TOM'S VISIT WAS OVER HOWEVER AND AS THE TIME DREW NEAR SHE WENT THROUGH SUCH ALTERNATIONS OF HOPE AND FEAR AND LIVED IN SUCH A STATE OF FEVERISH EXCITEMENT THAT SPIRITS AND COLOR CAME BACK AND SHE SAW THAT THE INTERESTING PALLOR SHE HAD COUNTED ON WOULD BE AN ENTIRE FAILURE
AH TOM IT S A GOOD SIGN WHEN YOU FIND TIME TO THINK OF GIVING PLEASURE TO YOUR LITTLE GIRLS AND GRANDMA PATTED HER SON'S BALD HEAD AS IF HE WAS N'T MORE THAN EIGHTEEN
AND THE WORDS WERE HARDLY OUT OF HER MOUTH WHEN THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN AND A LITTLE GIRL OF SIX OR SEVEN CAME ROARING IN
SUPPOSE WE HAVE A LITTLE RECESS AND REST WHILE POLLY PLAYS TO US
WAS KIND ONE DAY AND A BEAR THE NEXT
WE USED TO HAVE SUCH HAPPY TIMES AND IT S SO PLEASANT TO THINK ABOUT THEM NOW HE WAS AWFULLY GOOD WAS N'T HE NO HE WAS N'T
OLD JOSIAH QUINCY WAS MAYOR OF THE CITY AND HE SENT AUNT WORD THAT THE MARQUIS LAFAYETTE WISHED TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO HER
NEITHER CAN I
I WAS INTRODUCED TO A VERY BRILLIANT AND DELIGHTFUL YOUNG GENTLEMAN FROM AMERICA
HE HAD TO KEEP THE HOUSE FOR A WEEK AND LAID ABOUT LOOKING VERY INTERESTING WITH A GREAT BLACK PATCH ON HIS FOREHEAD
I LL TRY TO BE BETTER WORTHY HER FRIENDSHIP ANYWAY
HAVE N'T I THE APPEARANCE OF THE HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE ASKED TOM WONDERING IF IT COULD BE PITY WHICH HE SAW IN THE STEADY EYES FIXED ON HIM
THERE I WON'T CRY
YESTERDAY WHEN I TOLD HIM I MUST GO AT SOMETHING RIGHT OFF HE SAID ANYTHING HONEST TOM AND DON'T FORGET THAT YOUR FATHER BEGAN THE WORLD AS A SHOP-BOY YOU KNEW THAT DID N'T YOU YES HE TOLD ME THE STORY ONCE AND I ALWAYS LIKED TO HEAR IT BECAUSE IT WAS PLEASANT TO SEE HOW WELL HE HAD SUCCEEDED I NEVER DID LIKE THE STORY A LITTLE BIT ASHAMED I M AFRAID
IT WAS YOUR WHITE CLOAK AND MY IDIOTIC BEHAVIOR THE NIGHT WE WENT TO THE OPERA THAT PUT THE IDEA INTO HIS HEAD SAID POLLY FEELING AS IF THE EVENTS OF THAT EVENING HAD HAPPENED SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN SHE WAS A GIDDY YOUNG THING FOND OF GAY BONNETS AND GIRLISH PRANKS
THEN WE PUT OUR NIGHT-GOWNS OVER OUR DRESSES AND WERE LAID PEACEFULLY IN BED WHEN BETSEY CAME UP EARLIER THAN USUAL
BRING OUT EVERY RAG YOU VE GOT AND WE LL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE SAID POLLY LOOKING AS IF SHE ENJOYED THE PROSPECT FOR SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF THAT FEMININE FACULTY WHICH WE CALL KNACK AND MUCH PRACTICE HAD INCREASED IT
I LOVE SO TO BEAT EGGS
AND POLLY WENT TO THE PIANO WITH SUCH OBLIGING READINESS THAT SEVERAL REPROACHFUL GLANCES FELL UPON TRIX WHO DID N'T NEED HER GLASS TO SEE THEM
IT S PERFECTLY THRILLING
HE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU
AND WHEN TOM RAN UP TO BID HIS MOTHER GOOD-BY AND GIVE HER A HINT ABOUT MAUD'S GIFT SHE STAYED BELOW TO SAY AT THE LAST MINUTE IN UNCONSCIOUS IMITATION OF POLLY
BUT SHE SAID YES M RESPECTFULLY AND LOOKED AT THE FIRE
I DID N'T LIKE HIS MEETING ME SO MUCH AND TOLD HIM SO BY GOING ANOTHER WAY
AND TAKING A HASTY LEAVE OF THE SMALL GENTLEMAN SHE TURNED HOMEWARD SAYING CONFIDENTIALLY AS SHE PUT ONE HAND IN POLLY'S MUFF NOW MY DEAR YOU MUST N'T SAY A WORD ABOUT FRANK MOORE OR PAPA WILL TAKE MY HEAD OFF
BUT POLLY SAID EAGERLY I KNOW HE WOULD LIKE IT
THEY LL DO JUST AS WELL
THOUGH APPEARANCES ARE AGAINST HIM I DON'T BELIEVE TOM SHAW SAW YOU
MANY OF THEM FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT IN A WEEK BUT POLLY'S EFFORT WAS NOT LOST FOR EMMA BELLE AND FANNY REMAINED FIRM FRIENDS TO JANE SO KINDLY HELPING HER THAT THE POOR CHILD FELT AS IF SHE HAD INDEED BEEN BORN AGAIN INTO A NEW AND HAPPY WORLD
SO WHILE THEY SIGHED THEY SEWED PACKED VISIONS OF A BRILLIANT FUTURE AWAY WITH HIS NEW POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS AND REJOICED THAT THE WAY WAS OPEN BEFORE HIM EVEN IN THE ACT OF BEDEWING HIS BOOTS WITH TEARS
I WILL TRULY TRY FOR THE REST OF THE TIME AND BE AS GOOD AND GRATEFUL AS I CAN
AND SHE HAS PLENTY OF MONEY AND EVERY ONE TALKED ABOUT IT
AS MUCH AS TOM AND HE WROTE BACK THAT SHE WAS A NICE GIRL BUT HE HAD NO TIME FOR NONSENSE AND I NEED N'T GET MY WHITE KIDS READY FOR SOME YEARS YET UNLESS TO DANCE AT TOM'S WEDDING
HE S SUCH A CAPITAL FELLOW I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD HELP IT IT IS STRANGE
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT A FINE IMPRESSION THE STRANGERS RECEIVED OF THE MODEL CHILDREN MAUD WAS SO TICKLED WITH THIS YOUTHFUL PRANK THAT SHE UNGUARDEDLY SAT DOWN TO LAUGH ON THE EDGE OF AN OPEN TRUNK IMMEDIATELY DOUBLED UP FELL IN AND WAS WITH DIFFICULTY EXTRICATED
SHE WON'T LET US CALL IT GENIUS
WE RAKED OPEN THE FIRE PUT ON THE SAUCEPAN AND IN IT THE BEST OF OUR PLUMS WITH WATER ENOUGH TO SPOIL THEM
ARE YOU TRULY EXPELLED
NOW SHE WAS LEANING AGAINST HIM IN A COSY CONFIDING WAY DELIGHTFUL TO BEHOLD WHILE WILL'S STRONG ARM WENT ROUND HER WITH A PROTECTING AIR WHICH SAID AS PLAINLY AS ANY WORDS THAT THIS BIG BROTHER AND SMALL SISTER KNEW HOW TO LOVE AND HELP ONE ANOTHER
AS HE ROAMED ABOUT THE HOUSE THAT AFTERNOON TRYING TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH AN AUSTRALIAN OUTFIT WOULD COST THE SOUND OF LIVELY VOICES AND CLATTERING SPOONS ATTRACTED HIM TO THE KITCHEN
WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED TOM THROWING DOWN HIS BOOK WITH A YAWN THAT THREATENED DISLOCATION
I LIKE THAT WAY AND IT S VERY LITTLE TROUBLE MY HABITS ARE SO SIMPLE
I SHALL LIKE THE EXERCISE AND THE NEW PEOPLE AND PLACES I MUST SEE WILL AMUSE ME
YOU NEVER ASKED ME TO TELL YOU ANYTHING MY DEAR SO I KEPT MY OLD STORIES TO MYSELF ANSWERED GRANDMA QUIETLY
WHAT AND POLLY LOOKED SO SURPRISED AND INDIGNANT THAT FANNY WAS ASHAMED OF HERSELF AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT BY TELLING HER MOTHER SHE NEEDED SOME NEW GLOVES
AND IF ONE OF MY BROTHERS HAD ADDRESSED HIM AS GOVERNOR AS BOYS DO NOW I REALLY THINK HE D HAVE HIM CUT OFF WITH A SHILLING MADAM RAISED HER VOICE IN SAYING THIS AND NODDED SIGNIFICANTLY
OH WAS N'T SHE A SLY MINX CRIED BELLE AS IF SHE RATHER ADMIRED THE TRICK
NOT WHAT I CALL LITTLE GIRLS
POLLY WAS NOT A MODEL GIRL BY ANY MEANS AND HAD HER LITTLE PETS AND TEMPERS LIKE THE REST OF US
ANYTHING ANYWHERE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME
THAT SURPRISED ME SAID POLLY
I WAS AFRAID I SHOULD FIND THEM MANNISH AND ROUGH OR SENTIMENTAL AND CONCEITED
BESIDES I DON'T QUITE LIKE IT MYSELF
MAY I ASK WHO IS YOUR TEACHER I VE MORE THAN ONE
AS HE APPROACHED THE THREE OLD LADIES ROSE AND COURTESIED WITH THE UTMOST DIGNITY
FOR THERE ON THE FLOOR WITH HER HEAD PILLOWED ON A PAIR OF RUBBERS LAY POLLY IN AN ATTITUDE OF DESPAIR
MERCY NO I SHOULD HATE THAT
OH POLLY I M SO GLAD YOU VE COME CRIED THE LITTLE GIRL RUNNING TO HUG HER
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY HAVE GREAT DEAL NICER TIMES THAN WE DO
POLLY SAYS IT IS N'T PROPER TO TALK SECRETS BEFORE PEOPLE WHO AIN'T IN EM OBSERVED MAUD WITH DIGNITY
DOES SHE AND FANNY CONTINUED RAPIDLY
I THOUGHT SHE WAS AT ONE TIME AND EXPECTED EVERY DAY TO HAVE HER COME IN WITH A LONG FACE AND SAY SHE COULD N'T STAND IT
I LL GO TO THE OPERA SHE SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED TO THE DOVES
I CAN'T HELP IT IF THE BOYS SEND ME PHILOPENA PRESENTS AS THEY DO TO THE OTHER GIRLS THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT PHILOPENAS IN THE NOTE
SEE IF THERE IS N'T CRIED POLLY NODDING AND SMILING FOR FAN HAD CONFIDED TO HER THAT SHE MEANT TO TRY IT AFTER HER FRIEND HAD GONE
MIGHT BRING MIDGET HOME IT WILL PLEASE HER AND THERE S NO KNOWING WHEN THE GOVERNOR WILL BE BACK WITH THESE THOUGHTS IN HIS HEAD TOM LEISURELY GOT UNDER WAY AND LEFT HIS HORSE AT A NEIGHBORING STABLE FOR HE MEANT TO MAKE A LITTLE CALL AND SEE WHAT IT WAS MAUD ENJOYED SO MUCH
THE PROSPECT WAS NOT DAZZLING BUT HOME-LIKE AND PLEASANT
SHE IS A REGULAR BELLE AMONG THE BOYS SAID FANNY AS SHE PROMENADED BY
BUT NOW WHEN SHE SAW FANNY'S PINK SILK WITH A WHITE TARLATAN TUNIC AND INNUMERABLE PUFFINGS BOWS AND STREAMERS HER OWN SIMPLE LITTLE TOILET LOST ALL ITS CHARMS IN HER EYES AND LOOKED VERY BABYISH AND OLD-FASHIONED
WORKED AND STUDIED DRESSED AND PLAYED LIKE CHILDREN
WE FINISHED OFF BY HAVING THE BOOK-SHELVES TUMBLE ON OUR HEADS AS WE WENT DOWN A HILL AND LOSING MY CHAIR OFF BEHIND AS WE WENT UP A HILL
VERY MUCH
LET HIM GO FANNY
THAT S ENOUGH NONSENSE
YES AND THE VELOCIPEDE
FORTUNATELY FOR POLLY SHE FORGOT ALL ABOUT THEM IN HER ENJOYMENT OF THE FINE MUSIC WHICH SHE FELT RATHER THAN UNDERSTOOD AND SAT LISTENING WITH SUCH A HAPPY FACE THAT SEVERAL TRUE MUSIC-LOVERS WATCHED HER SMILINGLY FOR HER HEART GAVE A BLITHE WELCOME TO THE MELODY WHICH PUT THE LITTLE INSTRUMENT IN TUNE
IT NEVER WILL BE ANSWERED POLLY IN A TONE OF CALM DESPAIR
THERE AND MISS MILLS POINTED TO THE DOOR OF HER OWN LITTLE BEDROOM
YOU ARE THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN OF THE HOUSE AND IT S ONLY PROPER THAT YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR COMPANY FIRST POLLY DON'T CARE FOR MANNERS
SHE SHAN'T HAVE TOM
A DRESS PARADE CHAPTER 17
AND I THINK SEWING IS BETTER THAN PRINKING OR READING SILLY NOVELS SO NOW AND POLLY STITCHED AWAY WITH A RESOLUTE AIR FOR SHE AND FANNY HAD HAD A LITTLE TIFF
POLLY ENJOYED HERSELF TILL THE MUSIC STOPPED
SHE HAS N'T DANCED HARDLY ANY AND I VE HAD MORE THAN MY SHARE
THEY NODDED AFFABLY WHEN FANNY INTRODUCED HER SAID SOMETHING CIVIL AND MADE ROOM FOR HER AT THE TABLE ROUND WHICH THEY SAT WAITING FOR MONSIEUR
BOTH YOUNG MEN THOUGHT IT WAS GIRLISH VANITY AND SMILED AT ITS NAIVE DISPLAY BUT POLLY WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DEEPER THAN BEAUTY AND WAS GLAD NOT TO FIND IT
NEVER COULD RETURNED TOM
WE DON'T WANT YOU
WHAT'S THE JOKE ASKED FANNY WAKING UP AT LAST
YES AND LOVE THEM TOO FOR IN SPITE OF THEIR INDEPENDENCE THEY ARE WOMANLY
AS NONE OF US COULD GET OUT ALONE WE RESOLVED TO LOWER SALLY FROM THE WINDOW FOR SHE WAS LIGHT AND SMALL AND VERY SMART
DON'T SEE HOW SYDNEY DOES THE STEERING SO WELL
BUT WE DID N'T KNOW THAT AND FELT VERY IMPORTANT AS WE SAT WAITING FOR IT TO BOIL EACH ARMED WITH A BIG SPOON WHILE THE SUGAR BOX STOOD BETWEEN US READY TO BE USED
I SHOULD THINK THEY D BETTER GO
GRANDMA TURNED OVER THE LITTLE PACKET TIED UP WITH A FADED PINK RIBBON
SO POLLY FOUND PLENTY OF SMALL THINGS TO DO FOR HER AND DID THEM SO CHEERFULLY THAT THE POOR LADY LOVED TO HAVE THE QUIET HELPFUL CHILD NEAR TO WAIT UPON HER READ TO HER RUN ERRANDS OR HAND THE SEVEN DIFFERENT SHAWLS WHICH WERE CONTINUALLY BEING PUT ON OR OFF
I SUPPOSED I D GOT TO GO
MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT IT GROWLED TOM LYING DOWN AGAIN FOR HE HAD SAT BOLT UPRIGHT WHEN POLLY MADE THE ASTOUNDING DECLARATION THAT HE WAS LIKE THE WELL-BELOVED JIMMY
THEY WILL DO TO MAKE UP SETS AS GENTLEMEN ARE SCARCE
IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD FOR YOU BEAT IT UP YOURSELF TOM CRIED MAUD
AT NOON INSTEAD OF GOING HOME TO DINNER SHE WENT AND TOOK AN ICE TRYING TO FEET VERY GAY AND FESTIVE ALL BY HERSELF
ON THE HILL SOME LITTLE GIRLS WERE PLAYING WITH THEIR SLEDS REAL LITTLE GIRLS IN WARM HOODS AND COATS RUBBER BOOTS AND MITTENS AND POLLY FELT DRAWN TOWARD THEM IN SPITE OF HER FEAR OF FAN
THE REMAINS OF THE FEAST WENT TO THE PIG AND WE WERE KEPT ON BREAD AND WATER FOR THREE DAYS DID THAT CURE YOU OH DEAR NO
THAT SPRING THE DISEASE BROKE OUT WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN THE SHAW CIRCLE CAUSING PATERNAL HEADS MUCH BEWILDERMENT AS ONE CASE AFTER ANOTHER APPEARED WITH ALARMING RAPIDITY
STOP HOWLING MAUD AND COME HOME
I LIKE TO HEAR YOUR ADVENTURES AND GOOD WORKS SO MUCH SAID POLLY READY TO BE AMUSED BY ANYTHING THAT MADE HER FORGET HERSELF
MISS MILLS STOPPED TO STROKE THE FRESH CHEEK OPPOSITE TO SMILE AND SAY THEN POLLY I THINK I LL ASK YOU TO GO IN AND SAY A FRIENDLY WORD TO MY LITTLE GIRL
POLLY HAD SEEN A GOOD DEAL OF HIM DURING HER VISITS AT THE SHAWS WHERE HE WAS INTIMATE OWING TO THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MADAM AND HIS MOTHER
OH HOW SPLENDID
THAT S THE ROSE YOU PUT IN THE BIRTHDAY CAKE AND NEXT WEEK WE LL HAVE A FRESH ONE IN ANOTHER JOLLY LITTLE CAKE WHICH YOU LL MAKE ME
DON'T YOU WANT TO LIE DOWN SAID FANNY SITTING ON THE SIDE OF THE BED IN POLLY'S ROOM AND CHATTERING HARD WHILE SHE EXAMINED EVERYTHING HER FRIEND HAD ON
LITTLE JANE'S LAST THOUGHT HAD BEEN TO WISH WITH ALL HER MIGHT THAT GOD WOULD BLESS THE DEAR KIND GIRL UP THERE AND GIVE HER ALL SHE ASKED I THINK BOTH PRAYERS ALTHOUGH TOO HUMBLE TO BE PUT IN WORDS WENT UP TOGETHER FOR IN THE FULNESS OF TIME THEY WERE BEAUTIFULLY ANSWERED
A LITTLE CHECKED SILK WAS SENT IN OUR SPRING BUNDLE FROM MRS DAVENPORT AND MOTHER SAID KIT MIGHT HAVE IT IF SHE COULD MAKE IT DO
POLLY GLANCED UP AT HIM AND HER FACE DIMPLED AND SHONE AGAIN AS SHE ANSWERED LAUGHING
HIS MOTHER TALKED CONTINUALLY OF THAT DEAR BOY'S NARROW ESCAPE
THERE WAS GOOD STUFF IN POLLY UNSPOILED AS YET AND MISS MILLS WAS ONLY ACTING OUT HER PRINCIPLE OF WOMEN HELPING EACH OTHER
AS THIS REMARK FELL FROM HER THERE WAS A GENERAL SMILE AND POLLY SAID WITH MOCK SOLEMNITY IT WAS A SAD THING AND I VE NO DOUBT THAT MISGUIDED YOUNG MAN IS VERY SORRY FOR IT NOW HE LOOKED PERFECTLY BOWED DOWN WITH REMORSE LAST TIME I SAW HIM SAID WILL REGARDING TOM WITH EYES FULL OF FUN FOR WILL WAS A BOY AS WELL AS A BOOKWORM AND RELISHED A JOKE AS WELL AS SCATTER-BRAINED TOM
NOVELTY HATH CHARMS YOU KNOW GRANDMA USED TO LECTURE TOM FOR PLAGUING YOU POLLY AND HE USED TO SAY HE D BE A TIP-TOP BOY BUT HE WAS N'T OBSERVED MAUD WITH A VENERABLE AIR
WAS HE YOUR FATHER MADAM
DO YOU LIVE HERE ASKED JENNY WHEN HER TEARS WERE WIPED AWAY STILL CLINGING TO THE NEW-FOUND FRIEND
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY STORY ABOUT THEM AND GRANDMA TURNED THEM OVER WITH SPECTACLES BEFORE THE DIM EYES SO YOUNG AND BRIGHT WHEN THEY FIRST READ THE VERY SAME NOTES
BUT WHEN WE TALKED IT OVER LAST NIGHT IT STRUCK ME IN A NEW LIGHT AND I UNDERSTOOD WHY FATHER TOOK THE FAILURE SO WELL AND SEEMS SO CONTENTED WITH THIS POORISH PLACE
AFTER THE FIRST EXCITEMENT WAS OVER AND HE HAD TIME TO THINK HEART AND ENERGY SEEMED TO DIE OUT REMORSE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND AS GENEROUS THOUGHTLESS NATURES ARE APT TO DO WHEN SUDDENLY CONFRONTED WITH CONSCIENCE HE EXAGGERATED HIS FAULTS AND FOLLIES INTO SINS OF THE DEEPEST DYE AND FANCIED HE WAS REGARDED BY OTHERS AS A VILLAIN AND AN OUTCAST
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SENDING ME SUCH THINGS AND AS I DON'T CARE FOR THEM I M GLAD TO MAKE THEM OVER TO YOU YOUNG AND GIDDY INFANTS
I LL TAKE ANYTHING HE S GOT FOR I WANT TO BE OFF SAID TOM CASTING DOWN THE POKER AND TURNING ROUND WITH A RESOLUTE AIR WHICH WAS LOST ON POLLY WHO SAT TWIRLING THE ROSE THAT HAD FALLEN INTO HER LAP
WHILE THE LIVELY FANCIES OF MY YOUNG READERS WILL SUPPLY ALL DEFICIENCIES AND OVERLOOK ALL DISCREPANCIES
REGULUS WAS N'T BAD
JUST WHEN I OUGHT TO BE A PRIDE AND A PROP TO HIM I BRING HIM MY DEBTS AND DISGRACE AND HE NEVER SAYS A WORD OF BLAME
AND I LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU AS LONG AS I LIVE POLLY SAID THIS ALL IN ONE INDIGNANT BREATH AND THEN AS IF AFRAID OF SAYING TOO MUCH RAN OUT OF THE ROOM WITH SUCH A LOOK OF MINGLED CONTEMPT GRIEF AND ANGER THAT THE THREE CULPRITS STOOD DUMB WITH SHAME
FOR THE TRUTH THAT WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GOSSIP FILLED HIM WITH THE SHARP REGRET AND IMPOTENT WRATH AGAINST HIMSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS WHICH DRIVES MANY A PROUD FELLOW SO PLACED TO DESTRUCTION OR THE EFFORT THAT REDEEMS BOYISH FOLLY AND MAKES A MAN OF HIM
NOW THINGS WERE CHANGED
WELL FAN IS RATHER UNDER THE WEATHER
FANNY CONSIDERED HIM A BEAR AND WAS ASHAMED OF HIM
AND HE WAS SO PATIENT I USED TO WONDER AT HIM FOR HE WAS IN DREADFUL PAIN ALL TIME
I WISH I WAS AS OLD AND HOMELY AND GOOD AND HAPPY AS MISS MILLS SO POLLY MADE HER MOAN AND BY THE TIME SHE GOT HOME WAS JUST IN THE MOOD TO GO TO BED AND CRY HERSELF TO SLEEP AS GIRLS HAVE A WAY OF DOING WHEN THEIR SMALL AFFLICTION BECOMES UNBEARABLE
THE RED HEAD VANISHED LIKE A METEOR FOR POLLY'S TONE HAD BEEN DECIDEDLY COOL
YOUR WEDDING DEAR SWEETLY ANSWERED FAN FOR POLLY'S PLEASANT HINTS AND PREDICTIONS PUT HER IN A CHARMING HUMOR AND EVEN MADE OLD CLOTHES OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE
SAVE IT
HOW DO YOU GET ON
I REGRET TO SAY THAT POLLY NEVER COULD TALK WITH OR BE NEAR TRIX WITHOUT FEELING IRRITATED AND COMBATIVE
AS POLLY HAD NO MONEY FOR PRESENTS SHE HAD EXERTED HER INGENUITY TO DEVISE ALL SORTS OF GIFTS HOPING BY QUANTITY TO ATONE FOR ANY SHORTCOMINGS IN QUALITY
DRAWING HERSELF UP THEREFORE SHE FOLDED HER HANDS AND AFTER TWO OR THREE LITTLE HEMS BEGAN WITH AN ABSENT LOOK AS IF HER EYES BEHELD A FAR-AWAY TIME WHICH BRIGHTENED AS SHE GAZED
HE KNEW BETTER ALL THE TIME
THAT MINUTE DID MORE FOR POLLY THAN MANY SERMONS OR THE WISEST BOOKS FOR IT BROUGHT HER FACE TO FACE WITH BITTER TRUTHS SHOWED HER THE DARK SIDE OF LIFE AND SEEMED TO BLOW AWAY HER LITTLE VANITIES HER FRIVOLOUS DESIRES LIKE A WINTRY WIND THAT LEFT A WHOLESOME ATMOSPHERE BEHIND
MUM IS ASLEEP AND FAN OUT SO I LOAFED DOWN TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY FUN AFOOT SAID TOM LINGERING AS IF THE PROSPECT WAS AGREEABLE
MOTHER SPRUNG HER RATTLE AUNT RANG HER BELL JIP BARKED LIKE MAD AND WE ALL SCREAMED WHILE FROM BELOW CAME UP A REGULAR IRISH HOWL
COME ON IT WILL BE A JOLLY LARK I WOULD N'T FOR THE WORLD
BUT THE PLAYBILLS SHOWED HER NOTHING INVITING AND SHE WAS FORCED TO GO AWAY TO HER WORK WITH THE MONEY BURNING HER POCKET AND ALL MANNER OF WILD SCHEMES FLOATING IN HER HEAD
WELL SHE WOULD N'T TROUBLE HIM ANY MORE IF HE WAS SUCH A SNOB AS TO BE ASHAMED OF HER JUST BECAUSE SHE CARRIED BUNDLES AND WORKED FOR HER BREAD SHE CLUTCHED THE PAPER BAG FIERCELY AS SHE SAID THIS TO HERSELF THEN HER EYES FILLED AND HER LIPS TREMBLED AS SHE ADDED HOW COULD HE DO IT BEFORE HER TOO NOW TOM WAS QUITE GUILTLESS OF THIS OFFENCE AND HAD ALWAYS NODDED TO POLLY WHEN THEY MET
THAT IS A REFRESHING LITTLE PIECE OF NATURE SAID MR SHAW AS POLLY AND MAUD WHIRLED AWAY
ANOTHER THING THAT DISTURBED POLLY WAS THE WANT OF EXERCISE
I DON'T SEE HOW
YOU KNOW ANNA HAS BEEN LONGING TO GO
YES MY DEAR
TYING THE ROPE ROUND HER WAIST SHE CREPT OUT AND WE LET HER SAFELY DOWN SENT A BIG BASKET AFTER HER AND SAW HER SLIP ROUND THE CORNER IN MY BIG SUN BONNET AND ANOTHER GIRL'S SHAWL SO THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED
GOOD-BY GOOD-BY THE LAST ADIEU WAS A TRIFLE HUSKY AND TOM VANISHED AS IT WAS UTTERED LEAVING POLLY TO LAUGH OVER HIS PARTING SOUVENIR TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS
SELL YOUR HORSE CRIED POLLY AFTER A MINUTE OF DEEP MEDITATION
AND TOM SPOILT EM PLAYING BALL WITH HER IN THE YARD WOULD N'T YOU LIKE TO RIP THESE CLOTHES OFF AND HAVE ME SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE SOME NEW ONES SO YOU CAN DRESS AND UNDRESS CLARA AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE YES
NO MORE YOU DO NOW I THINK OF IT
I HOPE IT WILL DO HIM GOOD ADDED POLLY TURNING FROM HER EXPLORING EXPEDITION
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE DECEIVING WELL PAPA NEED N'T BE SO FUSSY SAID FAN PETULANTLY
I DON'T CARE IF HE HAS N'T
DID YOU NOW IF YOU WON'T LAUGH I LL SHOW YOU MY TREASURES
POLLY SEEMED TO DIVINE HIS WISH AND TUCKING A LITTLE CLEAN HANDKERCHIEF INTO ONE OF HIS HALF-OPEN HANDS SHE SAID I M GOING TO YOUR FATHER NOW AND WITH A FAREWELL SMOOTH SO COMFORTING THAT TOM WISHED SHE D DO IT AGAIN SHE WENT AWAY
HOW DO YOU GET ON ASKED POLLY THROWING OFF HER CLOAK AND ROLLING UP HER SLEEVES AS IF GOING TO WASHING
NOW BETWEEN OURSELVES FAN THE PRICE OF THAT DRESS WOULD GIVE YOU ALL YOU LL WANT FOR YOUR SPRING FIXINGS THAT S ONE CONSIDERATION
HE WOULD N'T LET US HAVE ANY WINE
AND WHILE THAT AFFAIR WAS BEING ARRANGED WE GIRLS HAD BEEN PELTING HIM WITH THE FLOWERS WHICH WE TORE FROM THE VASES THE WALLS AND OUR OWN TOPKNOTS TO SCATTER OVER HIM
THEY DON'T TELL US THEIR SECRETS BUT WE ARE SO SHARP WE CAN'T HELP FINDING THEM OUT CAN WE SAID TOM LOOKING SO MUCH INTERESTED THAT MAUD COULD N'T RESIST AIRING HER KNOWLEDGE A LITTLE
NEITHER POLLY NOR WILL TRIED TO DO ANYTHING OF THE SORT AND THAT WAS THE CHARM OF IT
YOU WERE SO GOOD TO ME THOSE LAST DAYS THAT I CAME VERY NEAR SPEAKING OUT BUT COULD N'T BEAR TO SEEM TO BE OFFERING YOU A POOR DISGRACED SORT OF FELLOW WHOM TRIX WOULD N'T HAVE AND NO ONE SEEMED TO THINK WORTH MUCH
THEN SOME OF THE YOUNG LADIES WERE PRESENTED AND AS IF TO ESCAPE ANY FURTHER SELF-SALUTATIONS THE MARQUIS KISSED THE PRETTY GIRLS ON THE CHEEK
HOW POLLY DID HOP WHEN I CROWED
FRIENDSHIP AND GOOD WORKS OH INDEED
YOU LL GET A LETTER FULL OF RAPTURES TOMORROW
FOR THEY CERTAINLY ARE THE MOST PROVOKING TOADS IN THE WORLD SAID FANNY AS SHE WATCHED THE SLOUCHY FIGURE OF HER BROTHER STROLLING DOWN THE STREET
WE SHALL BE IN THE ANTEROOM
BUT POLLY PROUDLY DISPLAYED THE RESOURCES OF HER CHINTZ-COVERED COUCH FOR THE BACK LET DOWN THE SEAT LIFTED UP AND INSIDE WERE ALL THE PILLOWS AND BLANKETS
THE TIME WHEN I SAW LAFAYETTE WAS IN 1825 AND THERE WERE NO TIPSY COUNTS THEN
DON'T KNOCK THE CHAIRS ABOUT BUT COME AND SIT DOWN AND TELL ME QUIETLY CAN'T DO IT WELL GO ON THEN
WE LL SHOW YOU THE SUNNY SIDE OF POVERTY AND WORK AND THAT IS A USEFUL LESSON FOR ANY ONE MISS MILLS SAYS ANSWERED POLLY HOPING THAT FAN WOULD LEARN HOW MUCH THE POOR CAN TEACH THE RICH AND WHAT HELPFUL FRIENDS GIRLS MAY BE TO ONE ANOTHER
IT WAS HEAVY AND HOT AND I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID OF IT BUT DID N'T LIKE TO SAY SO
SHE SAYS I TRY TO LIKE TOM AND WHEN HE IS PLEASANT WE DO VERY WELL
GIVE MY LOVE TO THE BABY AND SO GOOD-BY GOOD-BY
HAVE N'T YOU OBSERVED THAT SHE IS UNCOMMONLY JOLLY AND DON'T THAT SORT OF THING ACCOUNT FOR IT NONSENSE SAID FANNY SHARPLY
NO TOM WOULD N'T ASK ME THERE AND I WOULD N'T ACCEPT IF HE DID
IT IS MY PRIVATE OPINION THAT THE LITTLE SHIFTS AND STRUGGLES WE POOR GIRLS HAVE TO UNDERGO BEFOREHAND GIVE A PECULIAR RELISH TO OUR FUN WHEN WE GET IT
IT S A SHAME TO HAVE THE CHANCE LOST JUST BECAUSE HE HAPPENS TO SEE ME
AND THERE S NO NEED OF MAKING A TALK IF NOW AND THEN SOME ONE DOES RUN OFF LIKE CARRIE
YOUR MOTHER DON'T LIKE IT THAT IS N'T THE REASON I KNOW
BUT I LIKE TO BE LAZY SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS YOU DO
THAT S THE WAY THEY ALWAYS DO
FOR SINCE HER ENGAGEMENT SHE IS AS GAY AS EVER FLIRTS AWFULLY WITH ANY ONE WHO COMES ALONG AND KEEPS TOM IN A FUME ALL THE TIME
YES AND POLLY WILL HELP
FOR AS HE LISTENED HIS EYEBROWS SMOOTHED THEMSELVES OUT AND MORE THAN ONCE HIS LIPS TWITCHED AS IF HE WANTED TO LAUGH FOR AFTER ALL IT WAS RATHER COMICAL TO SEE HOW THE YOUNG PEOPLE APED THEIR ELDERS PLAYING THE NEW-FASHIONED GAME QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF ITS REAL BEAUTY POWER AND SACREDNESS
AND I THINK OF THE TWO I D RATHER AMUSE MYSELF SO THAN AS SOME YOUNG LADIES DO WHO GET INTO THE PAPERS FOR THEIR PRANKS RETURNED BELLE WITH A MORAL AIR
AND GWANDMA SAID IT WAS VEWY IMPWOPER FOR CHILDWEN TO DO SO MY MOTHER SAYS YOUR MOTHER'S COUP IS N'T HALF SO STYLISH AS OURS PUT IN ALICE
WE DON'T SEE SUCH SPLENDID OLD LADIES NOW-A-DAYS I THINK WE DO SOMETIMES SAID POLLY SLYLY
I ONLY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE WORDS MEANT SO WILL TELLS TALES DOES HE AND TOM'S FOREHEAD WRINKLED WITH A FROWN
JENNY PUT BOTH ARMS ABOUT HER NECK AND BEGAN TO SHED THE QUIET TEARS THAT SO REFRESH AND COMFORT HEAVY HEARTS WHEN A TENDER TOUCH UNSEALS THE FOUNTAIN WHERE THEY LIE
I HOPE I DID RIGHT SHE SAID TO HERSELF I COULD N'T BEAR TO HAVE HIM SHIRK AND SEEM COWARDLY
ALL AT ONCE THE DINING-ROOM DOOR OPENED AND TOM'S HEAD APPEARED
BUT I LL LOVE HIM ALL THE BETTER BECAUSE HE S POOR WITH THIS FEELING WARM AT HER HEART I DON'T WONDER THAT POLLY'S HAND HAD A SOOTHING EFFECT AND THAT AFTER A HEAVE OR TWO TOM'S SHOULDERS WERE QUIET AND CERTAIN SMOTHERED SNIFFS SUGGESTED THAT HE WOULD BE ALL RIGHT AGAIN IF HE COULD ONLY WIPE HIS EYES WITHOUT ANY ONE'S SEEING HIM DO IT
IT WAS DUSK WHEN SHE GOT HOME AND AS SHE SAT IN THE FIRELIGHT EATING HER BREAD AND MILK SEVERAL TEARS BEDEWED THE LITTLE ROLLS AND EVEN THE HOME HONEY HAD A BITTER TASTE
SORT OF BRIDAL YOU KNOW
IT WAS ALL MINE TOM STILL RED WITH SHAME AT BEING CAUGHT IN SUCH A SCRAPE LEFT FANNY TO HER TEARS AND WENT MANFULLY AWAY TO FIND THE INJURED POLLY AND CONFESS HIS MANIFOLD TRANSGRESSIONS
POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MR SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
POOR DEAR HOW I MUST HAVE WORRIED HER ALL THIS TIME AND NEVER GUESSED IT
BEGIN WITH JENNY MY DEAR
I DID N'T DARE TO HOPE ANYTHING TILL PAPA OBSERVED SOMETHING IN HIS MANNER AND TEASED ME ABOUT IT
SHE TRIED NOT TO CARE BUT GIRLS FEEL LITTLE SLIGHTS KEENLY AND MORE THAN ONCE POLLY WAS SEVERELY TEMPTED TO GIVE UP HER PLAN AND RUN AWAY TO THE SAFE SHELTER AT HOME
THAT SIMPLE LITTLE HISTORY HAD MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON TOM AND THE TEARFUL ENDING TOUCHED THE TENDER SPOT THAT MOST BOYS HIDE SO CAREFULLY
YOU CAN MAKE PRESENTS EASY ENOUGH
AT THE AUCTION SEVERAL PERSONS TRIED TO SHOW THE FAMILY THAT THOUGH THEY HAD LOST THEIR FORTUNE FRIENDS STILL REMAINED FOR ONE BID IN FANNY'S PIANO AND SENT IT TO HER
BUT SHE HAD A FEELING THAT IT WOULD N'T DO FOR IN PRAISING THEIR AFFECTION SHE WAS REPROACHING OTHERS WITH NEGLECT
THEY LAUGHED AND TALKED AND KEPT TAKING JUST ONE MORE TILL THE SUNSHINE WAS ALL GONE AND THE CLOCKS STRUCK DINNER-TIME
NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS N'T HE PROPOSED NO HE HAS N'T DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO I DON'T THINK HE LL EVER SAY A WORD TO ME WELL I AM SURPRISED AND FANNY DREW A LONG BREATH AS IF A LOAD WAS OFF HER MIND
I MEAN TO DO WHAT I VE UNDERTAKEN AND NOT TO BE TEMPTED AWAY FROM MY PURPOSE BY ANYTHING
WHO IS THAT SHE WHISPERED TO POLLY WHO HAD SUBSIDED INTO A CORNER
HANG GREEK AND LATIN
YOU DON'T COME AND REPORT AND I GOT ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU SAID FANNY LOOKING INTO THE CLEAR EYES BEFORE HER
IT S JUST SETTLED IS IT MARIA CRIED POLLY HOLDING ON TO A CHAIR AS IF TO BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING
NOW GO BACK OLD DEAR YOU MUST N'T FOLLOW ME
WON'T YOU STOP A BIT MISS POLLY NOT THIS MORNING I M RATHER IN A HURRY AND AWAY WENT POLLY AS IF A DOZEN EAGER PUPILS WERE CLAMORING FOR HER PRESENCE
I CAN'T BEAR TO COME DOWN ON HIM WITH THE WHOLE TRUTH AT ONCE SO YOU D LIKE TO HAVE ME GO AND TELL HIM FOR YOU POLLY'S LIP CURLED A LITTLE AS SHE SAID THAT AND SHE GAVE TOM A LOOK THAT WOULD HAVE SHOWN HIM HOW BLUE EYES CAN FLASH IF HE HAD SEEN IT
I WISH I COULD YOU LL DO IT BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE
BUT I M PROUD OF IT
HOW DOES THE NEW BOOK COME ON ASKED POLLY SUCKING HER ORANGE IN PUBLIC WITH A COMPOSURE WHICH WOULD HAVE SCANDALIZED THE GOOD LADIES OF CRANFORD BETTER THAN IT DESERVES
IT WAS COLD BUT STILL AND POLLY TROTTED DOWN THE SMOOTH SNOW-COVERED MALL HUMMING TO HERSELF AND TRYING NOT TO FEEL HOMESICK
YOU D BETTER HURRY UP YOUR APPLE FOR IF IT IS N'T DONE PRETTY SOON YOU LL HAVE TO LEAVE IT PUG SAID TOM LOOKING ANNOYED
HE IS N'T
AUNT TOOK A BIG BELL TO BED WITH HER
POLLY'S FOOT WAS KEEPING TIME TO THE LIVELY MUSIC AND HER EYES WERE FIXED WISTFULLY ON THE SMOOTHLY-GLIDING COUPLES BEFORE HER WHEN MR SYDNEY CAME TO HER SAYING IN THE PLEASANT YET RESPECTFUL WAY SHE LIKED SO MUCH MISS POLLY CAN YOU GIVE ME A TURN OH YES
THEY FOUND A REAL TALENT FOR MUSIC AN EAGER DESIRE FOR HELPFUL OPPORTUNITIES AND A HEART GRATEFUL FOR THE KINDLY SYMPATHY THAT MAKES ROUGH PLACES SMOOTH
FOR WHEN PAPA SAID WE MUST GIVE UP EVERYTHING AND MAMMA CALLED US ALL BEGGARS I DID THINK I D GOT TO GO ROUND ASKING FOR COLD VITTLES WITH A BIG BASKET AND AN OLD SHAWL OVER MY HEAD
WAS YOUR DRESS IMPORTED ASKED GRACE
I DON'T LIKE THE FASHION
THERE ARE PASSES FOR THE STATUARY EXHIBITION BECKY SHALL HAVE THOSE HERE ARE THE CONCERT TICKETS FOR YOU MY MUSICAL GIRL
YOU SEE IF HE IS N'T SO POLLY TUCKED HERSELF UP IN FRONT TOM HUNG ON BEHIND IN SOME MYSTERIOUS MANNER AND MAZEPPA PROVED THAT HE FULLY MERITED HIS MASTER'S SINCERE IF INELEGANT PRAISE
THE REST OF THE EVENING WAS TO BE DEVOTED TO THE GERMAN
THAT LAST PAGE WHERE POLLY TOOK THE BLAME ON HERSELF AND PROMISED TO TRULY TRY TO BE MORE KIND AND PATIENT WENT TO FANNY'S HEART MELTING ALL THE COLDNESS AWAY AND SHE COULD ONLY LAY HER HEAD ON THE TRUNK SOBBING IT WAS N'T POLLY'S FAULT
BUT I GUESS HE CAN HOLD HIS HORSES REPLIED THIS EVIL-MINDED BOY WITH AN AIR OF CALM RESIGNATION
IT WAS DELICIOUS TO SEE THE LITTLE AIRS POLLY PUT ON FOR SHE FELT AS IF SHE WERE SOMEBODY ELSE AND ACTING A PART
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS MEANT FOR A SAINT OR A MUSE A GODDESS OR A FATE
WHAT DO YOU THINK IF YOU REALLY MEAN WORK I KNOW YOU COULD ANSWERED POLLY QUICKLY AS ALL SORTS OF PLANS AND PROJECTS WENT SWEEPING THROUGH HER MIND
YOU D BETTER GO BEGAN POLLY WISHING TO OBEY YET FEELING A LITTLE SHY
I ONLY HOPE HE WON'T OVERWORK AND GET SICK AS SO MANY BOYS DO SAID SIMPLE POLLY WITH SUCH A RESPECTFUL BELIEF IN THE EAGER THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE OF COLLEGIANS AS A CLASS THAT TOM REGARDED THE DELUDED GIRL WITH A SMILE OF LOFTY PITY FROM THE HEIGHTS OF HIS VAST AND VARIED EXPERIENCE
POLLY KNOWS WHAT SHE S TALKING ABOUT
YES DEAR YOU ARE ALL I COULD ASK AND MRS SHAW LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH SUCH AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE IN HER EYES THAT POLLY GAVE TOM THE FIRST APPROVING LOOK SHE HAD VOUCHSAFED HIM SINCE SHE CAME
BUT WHY YOU WOMEN ALWAYS STICK TASSELS AND FRINGE ALL OVER A SOFA-CUSHION TO TEASE AND TICKLE A FELLOW IS WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ONE THING THAT POLLY DOES SUNDAY NIGHTS IS TO TAKE WILL'S HEAD IN HER LAP AND SMOOTH HIS FOREHEAD
SO WE CAN GO AND ENJOY THE MUSIC AND IF OTHER PEOPLE FLIRT IT WON'T BE OUR FAULT SAID FANNY IMPATIENTLY
NEVER MIND I THOUGHT SO
MAYBE I MIGHT WHEN I GOT THERE FOR I DO LIKE FUN AND SPLENDOR ADDED HONEST POLLY FEELING THAT PLEASURE WAS A VERY TEMPTING THING
WHEN MAUD CAME DOWN AND TROTTED CONTENTEDLY AWAY HOLDING WILL'S HAND TOM WATCHED THEM OUT OF SIGHT AND THEN STROLLED ABOUT THE HOUSE WHISTLING AND THINKING TILL HE WENT TO SLEEP IN HIS FATHER'S ARM-CHAIR FOR WANT OF SOMETHING BETTER TO DO
THE TWO BLACK SILKS WILL BE GOOD STAND-BYS FOR YEARS
HE LIKED THAT AND LAUGHED AND WAVED HIS HAND TO US WHILE WE RAN AND PELTED AND BEGGED HIM TO COME AGAIN
AND ALL THE SCHOOL-GIRLS TURNED INTO RIDICULE WITH AN UNSPARING HAND
IT WILL BE TIRESOME OF COURSE BUT I SHALL GET USED TO IT
SOME OF FAN'S OLD RIBBONS AND LACES WERE CONVERTED INTO DOLLS FINERY
WHAT LL FAN SAY TO YOU WAS HIS POLISHED SALUTATION
I WOULD N'T LET MANY GIRLS IN TO SEE MY POOR JENNY BECAUSE THEY D ONLY FLUTTER AND WORRY HER
OF COURSE THEY CAN'T
IT S SO DREADFUL TO BE SHUT OUT EVERYWHERE AND HAVE PEOPLE CRYING AND TALKING AND LOCKED UP AND I NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS SAID MAUD BESEECHINGLY
MY DEAR
GIRLS WILL DO SUCH FOOLISH LITTLE THINGS AND THOUGH WE LAUGH AT THEM I THINK WE LIKE THEM THE BETTER FOR IT AFTER ALL
IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE HER OBSERVED MAUD WHO COULD PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R NOW
AT ANY RATE I LL TRY AND HAVE NOTHING TO REPROACH MYSELF WITH IF THINGS DO GO CONTRARY WHAT POLLY THOUGHT OF AS SHE LAY BACK IN HER CHAIR WITH HER EYES SHUT AND A HOPELESS LOOK ON HER FACE IS NONE OF OUR BUSINESS THOUGH WE MIGHT FEEL A WISH TO KNOW WHAT CAUSED A TEAR TO GATHER SLOWLY FROM TIME TO TIME UNDER HER LASHES AND ROLL DOWN ON PUTTEL'S QUAKER-COLORED COAT
HIS TIE WAS UNDER ONE EAR HIS HAIR IN A TOSS THE CHERISHED MOUSTACHE HAD A NEGLECTED AIR AND HIS FACE AN EXPRESSION BOTH EXCITED ASHAMED AND DISTRESSED
WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU FIND TO DO ALL THE TIME ASKED FANNY WATCHING WITH INTEREST THE SET OF THE LITTLE RED MERINO FROCK POLLY WAS PUTTING ON TO HER DOLL
THE BOYS ALWAYS MADE FUN OF THE THINGS THOUGH THEY WERE AS GRATEFUL REALLY AS ANY OF US
SHE LIKES MUSIC AND IT WAS SO STORMY I COULD N'T GO LAST WEEK YOU KNOW ANSWERED FAN
I DON'T KNOW THE BOY LATELY
I DON'T WISH TO LOOK AFFECTED BUT THE MUSIC TELLS THE STORY SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE ACTING THAT I DON'T CARE TO LOOK ON HALF THE TIME ANSWERED POLLY HOPING TOM WOULD N'T SEE THE TEARS SHE HAD SO CLEVERLY SUPPRESSED
SUCH A TRYING MORNING AS THAT WAS
THEN THE WAIST CAN BE REFRESHED WITH THE BEST PARTS OF THESE WIDE FLOUNCES AND OUT OF THOSE NEW BITS WE WILL CONCOCT A HAT
FRANK AND GUS WITH SEVERAL OTHER SPLENDID FELLOWS REGALED THE YOUNG LADIES WITH COLLEGE GOSSIP AND BITS OF NEWS FULL OF INTEREST TO JUDGE FROM THE CLOSE ATTENTION PAID TO THEIR ELOQUENT REMARKS
YOU NEVER WOULD COMPLAIN
I HOPE NOT BUT I GUESS THERE S A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN ANY ONE WOULD SUSPECT WHAT CAN YOU KNOW ABOUT BROKEN HEARTS AND BLIGHTED BEINGS ASKED SYDNEY SMILING AT THE GIRL'S PENSIVE TONE
I DID N'T HEAR THE NAME AND DID N'T CARE
BUT JIMMY DID AND EVERY ONE LOVED HIM DID N'T YOU EVER SQUABBLE AS WE DO YES INDEED SOMETIMES
AND WON'T I TEACH MINNIE IN MY VERY BEST STYLE PUTTEL PURRED NICK CHIRPED APPROVINGLY AND POLLY ATE HER DINNER WITH A BETTER APPETITE THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED
I SHOULD THINK SHE D HATE ME
MY POLLY ALWAYS BRINGS THE SUNSHINE WITH HER AND MR SHAW HELD OUT HIS HANDS TO HIS LITTLE FRIEND FOR SHE WAS HIS FAVORITE STILL
THAT S THE SORT OF MUSIC IT S A PLEASURE TO HEAR
YES INDEED
GO IN AND WIN POLLY
A SLIGHT HAZE STILL LINGERED IN THE AIR AFTER THE STORM FOR FANNY WAS VERY HUMBLE AND TENDER THAT EVENING
SHE ONLY SAID THANK YOU MA'AM AND HEARTILY RETURNED THE KISS
I OWE AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY THAT THE GOVERNOR DON'T KNOW ABOUT OH TOM HOW COULD YOU I VE BEEN AN EXTRAVAGANT RASCAL I KNOW IT AND I M THUNDERING SORRY BUT THAT DON'T HELP A FELLOW I VE GOT TO TELL THE DEAR OLD BUFFER AND THERE S WHERE IT CUTS AT ANOTHER TIME POLLY WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN TOM'S FACE AND HIS LANGUAGE BUT THERE WAS A SINCERE REMORSE WHICH MADE EVEN THE DREADFUL WORD BUFFER RATHER TOUCHING THAN OTHERWISE
AND GREAT MERRIMENT WAS CAUSED BY POLLY'S BEWILDERMENT FOR SHE COULD N'T GUESS WHO HE WAS TILL SHE FELT THE BALD SPOT ON HIS HEAD
THANKS TO THIS KNOWLEDGE POLLY UNDERSTOOD TOM IN A WAY THAT SURPRISED AND WON HIM
IT WAS N'T MY FAULT THAT GUS AND FRANK WERE THERE AND I COULD N'T HELP THEIR SPEAKING TO ME
WE LIVED JUST OUT OF TOWN IN A LONELY PLACE
IT WAS N'T EASY TO FORGIVE
HE SEEMED TO TELL HIS STORY RAPIDLY AND STEADILY WITHOUT INTERRUPTION TO THE END
YOU LL BE SHOCKED AT OUR PERFORMANCES MISS SHAW BUT YOU CAN CALL IT A PICNIC AND NEVER TELL WHAT DREADFUL THINGS YOU SAW US DO SAID REBECCA POLISHING A PAINT KNIFE BY RUBBING IT UP AND DOWN IN A POT OF IVY WHILE KATE SPREAD FORTH THE FEAST IN SEVERAL ODD PLATES AND A FLAT SHELL OR TWO
I WAS AFRAID IT MIGHT UPSET YOU SAID POLLY SEEING NOW THAT IN SPITE OF HER QUIET MANNER FAN'S EYES HAD AN EXCITED LOOK AND HER CHEEKS A FEVERISH COLOR
AND WE CONSIDER OURSELVES YOUNG LADIES AT THAT AGE CONTINUED FANNY SURVEYING WITH COMPLACENCY THE PILE OF HAIR ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD WITH A FRINGE OF FUZZ ROUND HER FOREHEAD AND A WAVY LOCK STREAMING DOWN HER BACK
DID YOU GO ALONE DEAR ASKED GRANDMA PATTING THE ROSY CHEEK BESIDE HER
SHE THINKS I AM ODD AND COUNTRIFIED AND I DARE SAY I AM
YOU WERE MADE FOR A NICE HAPPY HOME OF YOUR OWN AND I HOPE YOU LL GET IT POLLY DEAR SAID FANNY WARMLY FEELING SO GRATEFUL TO POLLY THAT SHE FOUND IT HARD NOT TO POUR OUT ALL HER SECRET AT ONCE
I M GLAD OF THAT AND POLLY SURVEYED HERSELF WITH CARE
HE AWOKE TO THE JOYS OF A SOLITARY TEA FOR HIS MOTHER NEVER CAME DOWN AND FANNY SHUT HERSELF AND HER HEADACHE UP IN HER OWN ROOM
PLEASED WITH THIS PRAISE POLLY SANG AWAY IN A FRESH LITTLE VOICE THAT WENT STRAIGHT TO THE LISTENER'S HEART AND NESTLED THERE
IT WAS A VERY HUMBLE LITTLE ROOM BUT POLLY HAD DONE HER BEST TO MAKE IT PLEASANT AND IT ALREADY HAD A HOME-LIKE LOOK WITH THE CHEERY FIRE AND THE HOUSEHOLD PETS CHIRPING AND PURRING CONFIDINGLY ON THE RUG
IT WAS A VERY FOOLISH THING FOR HER TO DO SHE QUITE AGREED TO THAT
THE SIGHT OF YOU WILL DO HER GOOD
I VE TEASED AND BEGGED AND OFFERED ANYTHING I HAVE IF YOU LL ONLY BREAK YOUR ABSURD VOW AND COME AND ENJOY YOURSELF THANK YOU
FORTUNATELY THOSE WHO HAVE THE SKILL TO DETECT THESE TRAITS ALSO POSSESS THE SPIRIT TO APPRECIATE AND OFTEN THE POWER TO SERVE AND DEVELOP THEM
AND THOUGH HE HAD LAUGHED QUIETLY HE LIKED HONEST TOM AND GOOD-NATURED POLLY ALL THE BETTER FOR THEIR SIMPLICITY
FANNY WAS STRUCK AT ONCE BY THIS FACE AND FIGURE THOUGH THE ONE WAS NOT HANDSOME AND THE OTHER HALF HIDDEN BY A GREAT PINAFORE COVERED WITH CLAY
DID N'T HE DO WELL
OURS IS N'T AND PAPA WON'T DO ANYTHING OF THAT SORT YOU MAY BE SURE SAID FANNY WITH AS PROUD AN AIR AS IF OUR FAILURE WAS RATHER AN HONOR THAN OTHERWISE
OUR ROOM WAS THE FIRST AND WAS IN GOOD ORDER THOUGH THE TWO FLUSHED FACES ON THE PILLOWS WERE RATHER SUSPICIOUS
DISAPPOINTMENT NEED N'T MAKE A WOMAN A FOOL NOR AN OLD MAID IF SHE S PRETTY AND GOOD
YOUNG WRITERS BURNING TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES
SO THAT THERE WAS NO ONE BUT POLLY TO STAND BY TOM FOR THE PARLOR-MAID TURNED FAINT AT THE SIGHT OF BLOOD AND THE CHAMBER-MAID LOST HER WITS IN THE FLURRY
PERKY DON'T PRACTISE AS SHE PREACHES WHISPERED BELLE TO POLLY AS MISS P
WOMEN HAVE BEEN CALLED QUEENS A LONG TIME BUT THE KINGDOM GIVEN THEM IS N'T WORTH RULING ANSWERED REBECCA
DEAR POLLY OPYDILLDOCK IS FIRST-RATE FOR SPRAINS
CAN'T YOU GIVE US A SERMON A SHORT ONE
BUT BY SOME MISTAKE OR ACCIDENT IT WAS DISCOVERED AT THE LAST MINUTE THAT THERE WAS NO MILK
I CAN PUT THEM IN MY POCKET IF I FEEL TOO MUCH DRESSED SAID POLLY AS SHE SNAPPED ON THE BRACELETS BUT AFTER A WAVE OR TWO OF THE FAN SHE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE THEM OFF TILL THE EVENING WAS OVER SO ENTICING WAS THEIR GLITTER
GRANDMA SMILED AS SHE SMOOTHED THE OLD THING TENDERLY AND BEGAN HER STORY WITH EVIDENT PLEASURE
I M NOT GOING TO TELL TOM A WORD ABOUT IT BUT KEEP IT FOR A SURPRISE TILL HE COMES
BUT DON'T FOR MERCY SAKE SAY SUCH THINGS BEFORE THE OTHER GIRLS REPLIED FANNY WISHING POLLY WOULD WEAR EAR-RINGS AS EVERY ONE ELSE DID
THEN HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD NOT FULLY APPRECIATED HIS YOUNG FRIEND
BESIDES CONTRIVING SHARPENS YOUR WITS AND MAKES YOU FEEL AS IF YOU HAD MORE HANDS THAN MOST PEOPLE I THINK WE LL GET A FARM NEAR YOUR HOUSE
WHY DO YOU SUSPECT ME OF IT DEMANDED POLLY ALMOST ANGRILY
THIS FANCY HAUNTED US ALL AND OUR PREPARATIONS WERE VERY FUNNY
I TRULY WILL
AND AS SOON AS THE DOOR WAS SHUT TOM ROSE ON HIS ELBOW SAYING IN A CAUTIOUSLY LOWERED VOICE FAN DOES TRIX PAINT YES AND DRAWS TOO ANSWERED FANNY WITH A SLY LAUGH
BUT WHEN SOMETHING WARMER AND MORE FLATTERING THAN ADMIRATION RESPECT OR PLEASURE CREPT INTO HIS MANNER SHE COULD NOT HELP SEEING THAT ONE OF THE GOOD GIFTS OF THIS LIFE WAS DAILY COMING MORE AND MORE WITHIN HER REACH AND BEGAN TO ASK HERSELF IF SHE COULD HONESTLY RECEIVE THE GIFT AND REWARD THE GIVER
POLLY WHISKED IT WRONG SIDE OUT AND SHOWING THE CLEAN BRIGHT FABRIC SAID WITH A TRIUMPHANT WAVE BEHOLD YOUR NEW SUIT
IT S AWFUL
I KNOW IT S SOMETHING FUNNY TO MAKE YOU LAUGH SO SAID POLLY AND FAN TOGETHER
BUT SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HIM AS A POSSIBLE LOVER FOR EITHER FANNY OR HERSELF BECAUSE HE WAS SIX OR EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN THEY AND STILL SOMETIMES ASSUMED THE PART OF A VENERABLE MENTOR AS IN THE EARLY DAYS
AND IT STRUCK ME THAT PERHAPS I COULD GET A CHANCE OUT WEST SOMEWHERE
THERE WAS A LOCKET ON HER NECK EAR-RINGS TINKLING IN HER EARS WATCH AND CHAIN AT HER BELT AND SEVERAL RINGS ON A PAIR OF HANDS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPROVED BY SOAP AND WATER
IT S ONLY POLLY THAT S THE VERY THING
AND TOM OUGHT TO HAVE TOLD YOU SO IF YOU DID N'T KNOW ANY BETTER
BEING NEITHER TOM RUMMAGED TO HIS HEARTS CONTENT TILL FAN'S DRAWERS LOOKED AS IF SOME ONE HAD BEEN MAKING HAY IN THEM
I VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN HERE POLLY LEANED BACK AND LOOKED UP AT THE LITTLE MIRROR OVER THE CHIMNEY-PIECE WHICH WAS HUNG SO THAT IT REFLECTED THE FACES OF THOSE ABOUT THE FIRE
THEN LOOK OUT FOR YOUR NEW HORSE TOMORROW SIR AND MR SHAW STROKED THE FUZZY RED HEAD WITH A KIND HAND FEELING A FATHERLY PLEASURE IN THE CONVICTION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS BOY AFTER ALL
THEY ARE SO FULL OF MISCHIEF TO-NIGHT I LIKE TO SEE THEM SAID TOM AFTER IDLY WONDERING FOR A MINUTE IF SHE KNEW HOW LONG AND CURLY HER LASHES WERE
BUT AFTER MUCH TALKING AND CRYING KISSING AND LAUGHING THE BREACH WAS HEALED AND PEACE DECLARED
ARE THE HORSES BAD
AND WHILE HE ATE I SAW HIM GLANCE SHARPLY ABOUT FROM THE WOODEN BUTTONS ON THE BACK-DOORS TO THE SILVER URN AND TANKARDS ON THE DINING-ROOM SIDEBOARD
AND ACCORDING TO HER NOTIONS IT WAS FAR MORE IMPROPER TO FLIRT WITH ONE BOY THAN TO COAST WITH A DOZEN
YOU ARE GETTING TO BE A REGULAR OLD MAID FAN
MAKE IT TWO MONTHS AND STAY OVER CHRISTMAS
I NEVER KNEW SUCH OBSTINATE THINGS FOR THEY WOULD N'T SOFTEN THOUGH THEY DANCED ABOUT IN THE BOILING WATER AND BOBBED AGAINST THE COVER AS IF THEY WERE DOING THEIR BEST
AND YOU ARE SO LIKE ONE OF THE FAMILY THAT IT SEEMS QUITE NATURAL
IS IT ONE NO DEAR THANK GOD IT IS N'T BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF WE HAD N'T SAVED THE POOR LITTLE SOUL CRIED MISS MILLS WITH A SUDDEN BRIGHTENING OF THE FACE WHICH MADE IT BEAUTIFUL IN SPITE OF THE STIFF GRAY CURL THAT BOBBED ON EACH TEMPLE THE WANT OF TEETH AND A CROOKED NOSE
DO LET THEM STAY AND HEAR THE STORIES
WHY HE S RICH AND CLEVER AND BETTER THAN MOST OF YOU GOOD-FOR-NOTHING FELLOWS
IN SPITE OF HER SORROW SHE ENJOYED THAT MINUTE VERY MUCH FOR SHE WAS A BORN CONSOLER AND IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY FOR ME TO ADD LOVED THIS REPREHENSIBLE TOM WITH ALL HER HEART
IF SHE WAS A ROSY COSY LITTLE WOMAN LIKE POLLY IT WOULD COME EASIER THOUGH THOUGHT TOM AS HE MEDITATIVELY ATE HIS LAST NUT FEELING THAT FRATERNAL AFFECTION COULD NOT BE VERY DIFFICULT OF DEMONSTRATION TO BROTHERS BLESSED WITH PRETTY GOOD-TEMPERED SISTERS
IT S A MILLION TIMES BETTER BUT IT KNOCKED ME WORSE THAN THE OTHER
HOW IS FAN DASHING AS EVER
I M GLAD TO MAKE HER KNOWN TO ANY ONE
ALL THE GIRLS DO
IT WAS A VERY BRIGHT PICTURE BUT SOMETHING SEEMED AMISS WITH IT FOR PRESENTLY SHE SIGHED AND SHOOK HER HEAD THINKING SORROWFULLY AH BUT I DON'T LOVE HIM AND I M AFRAID I NEVER CAN AS I OUGHT
CARELESS THING
GORES IS OUT AND PLAITS IS IN
ADDING AS THEY LEFT THE HOUSE AGAIN IF ANY ONE MEETS US ON THE WAY I CAN'T HELP IT CAN I YOU CAN TELL THEM NOT TO CAN'T YOU THAT S RUDE
THOSE OLD CATS HAVE GOT IT I GUESS SUGGESTED MAUD TOO MUCH OVERWHELMED BY THIS SECOND BLOW TO HOWL AS USUAL
LET S HAVE AS MANY AS WE WANT AND PLAGUE AUNT BETSEY TO PAY HER FOR BEING SO CROSS I SAID GIVING NELLY HALF THE GREAT PURPLE PLUM
SEE WHAT A FINE FOREHEAD YET THE MOUTH IS BOTH FIRM AND TENDER AS IF IT COULD SAY STRONG WISE THINGS AS WELL AS TEACH CHILDREN AND KISS BABIES
AND THESE ODDS AND ENDS SO CAREFULLY TREASURED UP FOR THOSE AT HOME TOUCHED FANNY AND GREW BEAUTIFUL IN HER EYES
FOR SHE SAT PATTING THE PLUMP LITTLE HAND THAT LAY IN HER OWN AND LOOKING UP AT A FADED PICTURE OF AN OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A RUFFLED SHIRT AND A QUEUE
MAY I SHE WHISPERED TO FANNY
IT WAS A NEW WORLD TO HER AND THEY SEEMED A DIFFERENT RACE OF CREATURES FROM THE GIRLS WHOSE LIVES WERE SPENT IN DRESS GOSSIP PLEASURE OR ENNUI
I THINK I MUST BE A LITTLE CRAZY TO-NIGHT SAID POLLY GATHERING UP HER RESCUED FINERY AND PREPARING TO GO AND FIND FAN
FANNY CAN DO AS SHE LIKES BUT IT WOULD PLEASE ME VERY MUCH TO HAVE ONE OF MY GIRLS SING AS POLLY SINGS
IT S ONE OF MY FAVORITE DRESSES AND I HATE TO GIVE IT UP YOU WORE THAT THOROUGHLY OUT AND IT S ONLY FIT FOR THE RAG-BAG
MAUD WAS SO SCARED AT GENTLE POLLY'S OUTBREAK THAT SHE SAT AS STILL AS A MOUSE
SMALL STITCHES MAUD
PRESENTLY SHE SAID SOFTLY TOM ARE YOU ASLEEP JUST TURNING THE CORNER BEFORE YOU GET QUITE ROUND WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHAT A PUBLIC ADMONITION IS WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW FOR DEMANDED TOM OPENING HIS EYES VERY WIDE
THE SUN BEGAN TO GET LOW WE WERE AFRAID DEBBY WOULD COME DOWN AND STILL THOSE DREADFUL PLUMS WOULD N'T LOOK LIKE SAUCE
BUT FROM THAT DAY THERE SLOWLY CREPT INTO THE FAMILY MORE RESPECT FOR GRANDMA MORE FORBEARANCE WITH HER INFIRMITIES MORE INTEREST IN HER LITTLE STORIES AND MANY A PLEASANT GOSSIP DID THE DEAR OLD LADY ENJOY WITH THE CHILDREN AS THEY GATHERED ROUND HER FIRE SOLITARY SO LONG
HOW KIND OF YOU POLLY
SO WHEN POLLY TALKED ABOUT OLD PEOPLE IT RECALLED THIS SCENE AND MADE FAN CROSS
IS MY HAIR ALL RIGHT AND MY HAT BEFORE POLLY COULD ANSWER MR GUS JOINED THEM AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND POLLY SOON FOUND HERSELF TROTTING ON BEHIND FEELING THAT THINGS WERE NOT ALL RIGHT THOUGH SHE DID N'T KNOW HOW TO MEND THEM
BUT WHEN THEY PARTED FOR THE NIGHT FANNY GAVE THE WOUNDED HEAD A GENTLE PAT TOM NEVER WOULD HAVE FORGIVEN HER IF SHE HAD KISSED HIM AND SAID IN A WHISPER I HOPE YOU LL HAVE A GOOD SLEEP TOMMY DEAR AND TOM NODDED BACK AT HER WITH A HEARTY SAME TO YOU FAN THAT WAS ALL
I KNOW IT IS AND I WANT TO HELP BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN SAID POLLY FEELING QUITE OPPRESSED WITH THE IMMENSITY OF THE WORK
I SAID I THOUGHT IF A FELLOW TOOK A GIRL TO A PARTY SHE OUGHT TO DANCE WITH HIM ONCE AT LEAST ESPECIALLY IF THEY WERE ENGAGED
I SAY POLLY SUPPOSE WE BREAK IT TO HIM EASY ADDED TOM AFTER ANOTHER TURN
WELL I NEVER WILL AGAIN YES YOU WILL YOU CAN'T HELP IT AND POLLY'S EYE GLANCED AT SYDNEY WHO WAS IN FRONT WITH FAN
BESIDES MOTHER SAYS THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT ME NEITHER CAN WE
THESE WHITE MUSLINS AND PRETTY SILKS WILL KEEP FOR YEARS SO I SHOULD LAY THEM BY TILL THEY ARE NEEDED
A DRESS PARADE THE WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED TAUGHT THE SHAWS AS MANY OTHER FAMILIES HAVE BEEN TAUGHT HOW RAPIDLY RICHES TAKE TO THEMSELVES WINGS AND FLY AWAY WHEN THEY ONCE BEGIN TO GO
SO I TRIED TO MAKE IT JUST LIKE HERS AND I DO HOPE IT WILL PROVE A GOOD SWEET PLUMMY ONE THANK YOU WAS ALL TOM SAID AS HE SMILED AT THE GIVER BUT POLLY KNEW THAT HER PRESENT HAD PLEASED HIM MORE THAN THE MOST ELEGANT TRIFLE SHE COULD HAVE MADE
BIDDY WHO SLEPT IN THE ATTIC PRACTISED GETTING OUT ON THE SHED ROOF SO THAT SHE MIGHT RUN AWAY AT THE FIRST ALARM
BUT IN SPITE OF THE COQUETTISH LITTLE ROSE-COLORED HOOD SHE WORE AND WHICH SHE KNEW WAS VERY BECOMING SHE DID NOT LOOK OR SPEAK GAYLY AND TOM SAW SOMETHING IN THE ALTERED FACE THAT MADE HIM SAY HASTILY I M AFRAID YOU VE BEEN DOING TOO MUCH THIS WINTER
POLLY DID NOT LOOK SICK THOUGH HER CHEEKS WERE THINNER AND HER COLOR PALER THAN FORMERLY BUT SHE SEEMED SPIRITLESS AND THERE WAS A TIRED LOOK IN HER EYES THAT WENT TO FANNY'S HEART
ALL OF WHICH WILL LAUGHED AT ACCEPTED GRACIOUSLY AND DID N'T OBEY
TOM MAY LIKE TO BEAT THE EGGS FOR YOU
CUTTING CAREFULLY SLICE AFTER SLICE FELL APART
THE OLD GENTLEMAN ASKED TOM
MAMMA SAID I WAS SOBBED MAUD EVIDENTLY LABORING UNDER THE DELUSION THAT FRACTIOUSNESS WAS SOME INTERESTING MALADY
YOU KNEW IT ALL THE TIME AND DID N'T TELL JUST TO PLAGUE US SCOLDED MAUD
GOOD-BY CHAPTER 8
NOW MA'AM WE LL TAKE A TURN AT ALGIBBERA
THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH POLLY MADE HER TOILET THAT NIGHT WAS DELIGHTFUL TO BEHOLD
UNDER THE BED WENT THE BASKET AND INTO THE BEDS WENT THE CONSPIRATORS AND NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE DECOROUS THAN THE APPEARANCE OF THE ROOM WHEN BETSEY POPPED HER HEAD IN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY THINGS SHE DEMANDED IN A LOW TONE WHILE HER EYES KINDLED AND HER COLOR CHANGED
AND SHE WAS SO HAPPY SHE NEVER SAW OR SUSPECTED HOW MANY LITTLE MANOEUVRES HEART-BURNINGS DISPLAYS OF VANITY AFFECTATION AND NONSENSE WERE GOING ON ALL ROUND HER
OBEDIENT POLLY WENT THROUGH THE ROOM SEVERAL TIMES APPARENTLY EXAMINING THE PICTURES WITH THE INTEREST OF A CONNOISSEUR AND TRYING NOT TO HEAR THE MILD PRATTLE OF THE PAIR ON THE ROUND SEAT
SINCE THEN HE HAS N'T MENTIONED MARIA SO I WAS SURE THERE WAS SOMETHING SERIOUS GOING ON AND BEING IN TOM'S CONFIDENCE HE KEPT QUIET IT DOES LOOK BAD
QUEER GIRL IS N'T SHE ADDED TOM WHO HAD FOLLOWED TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON
DO TELL ABOUT HER CRIED BELLE EAGERLY
WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE WE FORGOT MY IVY AND KITTY CAME RUNNING AFTER ME WITH IT
THEN A DEAD SILENCE FELL UPON THE ROOM AND NOTHING WAS HEARD BUT THE SPRING RAIN SOFTLY FALLING OUT OF DOORS
HE S NOT A BOY BUT A FAST FELLOW AND I WON'T HAVE HIM ABOUT
YET THE PLAIN SUIT BECAME HER EXCELLENTLY AND ONE NEVER THOUGHT OF THE DRESS LOOKING AT THE ACTIVE FIGURE THAT WORE IT FOR THE FREEDOM OF HER CHILDHOOD GAVE TO POLLY THAT GOOD GIFT HEALTH AND EVERY MOVEMENT WAS FULL OF THE VIGOR GRACE AND EASE WHICH NOTHING ELSE CAN SO SURELY BESTOW
I AIN'T GOING TO BE HUSTLED ROUND
WHOSE DOING IS THAT ASKED TOM SURVEYING THE GIFT WITH SATISFACTION
AND I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULD N'T ENJOY MYSELF AS WELL AS TRIX YOU LL GET TO ENJOYING YOURSELF TOO MUCH IF YOU ARE N'T CAREFUL
ANOINTED HIS CURLY CROP WITH HER HAIR-OIL
THEREFORE AS THE TOP OF THIS SKIRT IS QUITE FRESH WE WILL TAKE OFF THE RUFFLES TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN AND LEAVE IT PLAIN
IF I MAY ANSWERED POLLY
NOW HOWEVER THE THUNDER-CLAP HAD COME AND AFTER THE FIRST ALARM FINDING THEY WERE NOT KILLED THEY BEGAN TO DISCOVER A CERTAIN HALF-ANXIOUS HALF-PLEASANT EXCITEMENT IN TALKING IT OVER ENCOURAGING ONE ANOTHER AND FEELING UNUSUALLY FRIENDLY AS PEOPLE DO WHEN A SUDDEN SHOWER DRIVES TWO OR THREE TO THE SHELTER OF ONE UMBRELLA
THE THREE MONTHS ARE OUT SO PAY UP TOMMY ALL RIGHT WHAT WILL YOU HAVE YOU MAY MAKE IT GLOVES
I THOUGHT HE WAS EXTRAVAGANT RECKLESS AND DANDIFIED
BUT WITH FANNY AND POLLY HE SHOWED THE DOMESTIC TRAITS AND VIRTUES WHICH ARE MORE ENGAGING TO WOMANLY WOMEN THAN ANY AMOUNT OF COOL INTELLECT OR WORLDLY WISDOM
SO POLLY TOLD WITH MUCH RELUCTANCE AND MUCH QUESTIONING ALL SHE KNEW OF THE WALKS THE LUNCHES THE MEETINGS AND THE NOTES
UNFORTUNATELY SHE GIGGLED FOR TOM'S FIERCE ATTITUDE WAS SUCH A FUNNY CONTRAST TO HIS DRESS THAT SHE COULD N'T HELP IT
YOU SEE SHE LEARNED TO LOVE HIM ONE SUMMER WHEN HE MADE THEM A VISIT
TAKE PAINS
A STRONG SUSPICION TOOK POSSESSION OF ME AND I WATCHED HIM AS A CAT DOES A MOUSE
SO THAT THEY DON'T FIND IT OUT AND I DO THANK YOU TOM SO MUCH OH COME POLLY THAT WON'T DO
IT S THE OTHER AND TOM TOOK UP A SECOND PAPER LOOKING HALF ANGRY HALF ASHAMED AT HIS OWN MISTAKE
I DID N'T KNOW WHAT TO GIVE YOU FOR YOU VE GOT EVERYTHING A MAN WANTS AND I WAS IN DESPAIR TILL I REMEMBERED THAT DEAR GRANDMA ALWAYS MADE YOU A LITTLE CAKE LIKE THAT AND THAT YOU ONCE SAID IT WOULD N'T BE A HAPPY BIRTHDAY WITHOUT IT
I HOPE HE WON'T FORGET TO ORDER MY SWEETBREAD SIGHED MRS SHAW ONE DAY AS SHE WATCHED HER HUSBAND SLOWLY GOING DOWN THE STREET
THEN I LL COME IN AND WE LL HAVE IT OUT POLLY ROSE AND WENT TO THE DOOR WITHOUT A WORD
GIVE ME THAT KEY OR I LL MAKE YOU NOW TOM DON'T BE SAVAGE
FROM THE MOMENT WHEN ON TAKING POSSESSION OF THE COVETED ROOM SHE OPENED THE DOORS OF THE THREE-CORNERED CLOSET AND FOUND A LITTLE KETTLE JUST LIKE POLLY'S STANDING THERE SHE FELT THAT A GOOD TIME WAS COMING FOR HER AND FELL TO DUSTING FURNITURE WASHING CUPS AND MAKING TOAST THE HAPPIEST FUSSIEST LITTLE HOUSEWIFE IN THE CITY
TOUCHED BY THESE UNUSUAL DEMONSTRATIONS MAUD CREPT QUIETLY TO HER FATHER'S KNEE AND WHISPERED WITH A GREAT TEAR SHINING ON HER LITTLE PUG NOSE PAPA WE DON'T MIND IT MUCH AND I M GOING TO HELP FAN KEEP HOUSE FOR YOU
ONE MAN REPORTED THAT SOME ONE TAPPED AT HIS WINDOW IN THE NIGHT SAYING SOFTLY IS ANYONE HERE AND WHEN HE LOOKED OUT TWO MEN WERE SEEN TO RUN DOWN THE ROAD
I NEVER DID SEE SUCH RIDICULOUS PEOPLE POLLY SHUT HER DOOR HARD AND FELT READY TO CRY WITH VEXATION THAT HER PLEASURE SHOULD BE SPOILT BY SUCH A SILLY IDEA
AND IF YOU WAS N'T A BEAR YOU D LIKE IT WELL I CALL THAT MEAN
KEEP QUIET CRY-BABY
HOW DID YOU KNOW AND TOM GOT OVER THE ORDEAL OF HAND-SHAKING WITHOUT THINKING OF IT HE WAS SO SURPRISED
THE GIRLS LAUGHED AT ME WHEN I SAID SO AND THEY DECLARED THAT IT WOULD BE A VERY IMPROPER THING TO DO BUT I VE OBSERVED THAT THEY DON'T HESITATE TO SNUB INELIGIBLE PARTIES AS THEY CALL POOR VERY YOUNG OR UNPOPULAR MEN
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE MOMENT WHILE WILL WAS WRESTLING WITH HIS BOOTS IN THE CLOSET AND MAUD WAS ABSORBED IN PACKING HER APPLE INTO A LARGE BASKET POLLY SAID TO TOM IN A LOW TONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING SO KIND TO WILL BLESS YOUR HEART I HAVE N'T DONE ANYTHING
MUSLIN WITH POCKETS AND TINY BLUE BOWS
AT FIRST POLLY THOUGHT SHE HAD GOT INTO FAIRY-LAND AND SAW ONLY THE SPARKLING CREATURES WHO DANCED AND SUNG IN A WORLD OF LIGHT AND BEAUTY
BUT I M SICK OF HIM AND TOM DEALT HARKNESS'S LATIN READER A THUMP WHICH EXPRESSED HIS FEELINGS BETTER THAN WORDS
YOU LITTLE GOOSE IT S JUST THE WAY IT WAS DONE IN PARIS AND THE DANCING IS SPLENDID
I WISH I HAD SEEN WILL'S FACE WHEN MAUD PROPOSED ANSWERED POLLY WITH A NOD WHICH ANSWERED HER FRIEND'S SPEECH BETTER THAN HER WORDS
HER BOX OF DAINTY GLOVES HER JEWEL-DRAWER HER CRIMPING-PINS AS FINE AND FANCIFUL A WARDROBE AS A PARIS DOLL AND A FRENCH MAID TO DRESS HER
I FELT SO MYSELF AND THOUGHT WE D HAVE A JOLLY LITTLE PARTY ALL IN THE FAMILY SAID TOM LOOKING MUCH GRATIFIED AT HER DELIGHT
FOR THIS BENIGHTED YOUTH HAD NOT YET DISCOVERED THAT COLLEGE NOWADAYS IS A PLACE IN WHICH TO SKY-LARK NOT TO STUDY
I USED TO ENVY FANNY
BUT IT S COWARDLY FOR A GREAT BOY LIKE YOU TO ROB A GIRL I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU
SOME OF IT WAS SPLENDID
IS THAT ALL AND FAN GAVE HER A CURIOUS LOOK OF MINGLED DISAPPOINTMENT AND RELIEF
IF HE HAD BEEN RAGING LIKE A BEAR POLLY WOULD N'T HAVE CARED SHE WAS SO PLEASED THAT HE WANTED HER AND SO GLAD TO BE A CONFIDANTE AS SHE USED TO BE IN THE HAPPY OLD DAYS THAT SHE WOULD JOYFULLY HAVE FACED A MUCH MORE FORMIDABLE PERSON THAN RECKLESS TOM
HE TOLD A FUNNY STORY ABOUT BLOWING UP ONE OF THE PROFESSORS
SO I DO AND SHE IS THE MOST PROMISING PUPIL I HAVE
SHE LL BE SO PLEASED THAT PUPPY SENDS HER THINGS OF THIS SORT DOES HE AND MR SHAW LOOKED FAR FROM PLEASED AS HE PULLED OUT THE NOTE AND COOLLY OPENED IT
WHO DID YOU THINK I MEANT ASKED POLLY SOPPING UP THE WATER BEFORE IT DAMAGED HER PIANO
NAME AGE AND DATE LIKE A NICE WHITE TOMBSTONE OBSERVED MAUD COMPLACENTLY AT WHICH FUNEREAL REMARK MRS SHAW WHO WAS DOWN IN HONOR OF THE DAY DROPPED HER NAPKIN AND DEMANDED HER SALTS
COME IN PLEASE AND DON'T LOOK SCARED
THE FRIENDS HAD A SOCIAL CUP O TEA UPSTAIRS WHICH POLLY CONSIDERED THE HEIGHT OF LUXURY AND THEN EACH TOOK A MIRROR AND PROCEEDED TO PRINK TO HER HEART'S CONTENT
SYDNEY CAN WAIT BUT HE WON'T LONG IF I KNOW MYSELF YOU WON'T TAKE IT AS A GIFT THEN WOULD YOU NO THEN DON'T THINK I WILL
AND POLLY THINKING OF FEEBLE SELFISH MRS SHAW ASLEEP UP STAIRS SAW WITH SUDDEN CLEARNESS WHAT A WIFE SHOULD BE TO HER HUSBAND A HELPMEET NOT A BURDEN
WELL I DID THINK YOU HAD MORE SENSE THAN MOST GIRLS
NEW FASHIONS CHAPTER 3
A FAMOUS MAN WHO LIVED IN THE TIME OF QUEEN ELIZABETH ANSWERED FAN WITH A LOOK AT POLLY
DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH THEM SAID FAN CALMLY
NOW WE LL RETURN TO BUSINESS SAID POLLY DESCENDING BREATHLESS BUT SATISFIED WITH THE EFFECT OF HER FUN
POLLY LAUGHED AS SHE RAN TO VIEW THE RUIN FOR TOM LAY FLAT ON HIS BACK WITH THE VELOCIPEDE ATOP HIM WHILE THE BIG DOG BARKED WILDLY AND HIS MASTER SCOLDED HIM FOR HIS AWKWARDNESS
YOU D GET ON TOGETHER I M SURE
PAPA SAID SO
BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE LITTLE THINGS WHICH ARE ALWAYS WAITING TO BE DONE IN THIS WORLD OF OURS WHERE RAINY DAYS COME SO OFTEN WHERE SPIRITS GET OUT OF TUNE AND DUTY WON'T GO HAND IN HAND WITH PLEASURE
IT WAS VERY NICE BUT IT DID N'T LAST
ALL THESE HELPED POLLY AS UNCONSCIOUSLY AS SHE HELPED THEM FOR PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLE ARE THE BEST TEACHERS WE CAN HAVE AND THE WANT OF THEM MAKES HALF THE WOMEN OF AMERICA WHAT THEY ARE RESTLESS AIMLESS FRIVOLOUS AND SICK
YOU BOYS NEVER TEASED ME AS TOM DID THAT S THE REASON IT AMUSED ME I SUPPOSE
AT THE STUDY DOOR THEY FOUND MAUD WHOSE COURAGE HAD GIVEN OUT FOR MR MERTON'S FIT RATHER HAUNTED HER
SALLY DIVED INTO HER BED RECKLESSLY DEMOLISHING THE LAST PIE AND SCATTERING THE CANDY FAR AND WIDE
BURNT HIS INQUISITIVE NOSE WITH SMELLING-SALTS
YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE AS MANY WORRIES AS OTHER PEOPLE
FOR THOUGH WILL WAS NEARLY THREE YEARS YOUNGER THAN POLLY HE COULD N'T FOR THE LIFE OF HIM HELP ASSUMING AMUSINGLY VENERABLE AIRS WHEN HE BECAME A FRESHMAN
NEITHER DID I TILL TO-NIGHT
I SHALL GET ON VERY WELL I THINK FOR I VE GOT TWELVE SCHOLARS TO BEGIN WITH ALL ABLE TO PAY A GOOD PRICE AND I SHALL GIVE MY FIRST LESSON ON MONDAY DON'T YOU DREAD IT ASKED FANNY
THAT REMINDS ME THAT MAMMA SAYS THEY WANT AS MANY THINGS AS WE CAN MAKE FOR IT S A HARD WINTER AND THE POOR ARE SUFFERING VERY MUCH
SHE ADMIRES TO HAVE YOU AND LIKES TO TELL STORIES AND DO PLEASANT THINGS ONLY SHE THINKS YOU DON'T CARE FOR HER QUIET SORT OF FUN
THE FIRST OBSTACLE WAS SURMOUNTED IN THIS WAY
BUT THE WORDS DID HER GOOD AND HER PLAIN DRESS LOOKED CHARMING ALL OF A SUDDEN
MAY WE STAY AND SEE THE FUNNY THINGS SAID FAN AND MAUD EYEING THE OPEN CABINET WITH INTEREST
HOW IS YOUR MOTHER AND MAUDIE
BELLS WERE HUNG ON DOOR HANDLES STICKS OF WOOD PILED UP IN DARK CORNERS FOR ROBBERS TO FALL OVER AND THE FAMILY RETIRED ALL ARMED AND ALL PROVIDED WITH LAMPS AND MATCHES
IT REALLY WOULD BE A RELIEF TO THAT WHOLE FAMILY IF POOR DEAR MRS SHAW COULD BE AHEM
BY AND BY FANNY CAME FLYING IN AND GAVE TOM A GREATER SURPRISE THAN HIS HAD BEEN
THAT SOUND GAVE POLLY MORE PAIN THAN THE NEWS OF A DOZEN FAILURES AND EXPULSIONS AND IT WAS AS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO RESIST PUTTING HER HAND TENDERLY ON THE BENT HEAD AS IT WAS FOR HER TO HELP NOTICING WITH PLEASURE HOW BROWN THE LITTLE CURLS WERE GROWING AND HOW SOFT THEY WERE
PRESENTLY TOM'S VOICE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY ASKING EAGER QUESTIONS TO WHICH BRIEF REPLIES WERE GIVEN
THINK HOW ABSORBED I MUST BE IN PREPARATION FOR THIS GRAND AFFAIR
AIN'T YOU TIRED TO DEATH
THEN THERE'D HAVE BEEN NO TROUBLE BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DOING A LIE WHICH IS MOST AS BAD AS TELLING ONE DON'T BE A GOOSE
THAT I WAS IN LOVE
NOW WHAT SHALL IT BE
TWO OLD WIDOW LADIES LIVE BELOW ME SEVERAL STUDENTS OVERHEAD POOR MRS KEAN AND HER LAME BOY HAVE THE BACK PARLOR AND JENNY THE LITTLE BEDROOM NEXT MISS MILLS
NOW SHE COULD NOT HELP YEARNING OVER THIS FAULTY WELL-BELOVED SCAPEGRACE TOM OR HELP THINKING WITH A LITTLE THRILL OF HOPE IF TRIX ONLY CARED FOR HIS MONEY SHE MAY CAST HIM OFF NOW HE S LOST IT
FORBIDDEN FRUIT I M PERFECTLY ACHING FOR SOME FUN SAID POLLY TO HERSELF AS SHE OPENED HER WINDOW ONE MORNING AND THE SUNSHINE AND FROSTY AIR SET HER BLOOD DANCING AND HER EYES SPARKLING WITH YOUTH HEALTH AND OVERFLOWING SPIRITS
MAMMA NEVER ALLOWS US TO BEAT DOWN WORKWOMEN BUT WISHES US TO PAY THEM WELL AND ECONOMIZE IN SOME OTHER WAY IF WE MUST SAID EMMA DAVENPORT A QUIET BRIGHT-EYED GIRL WHO WAS CALLED ODD AMONG THE YOUNG LADIES BECAUSE SHE DRESSED SIMPLY WHEN HER FATHER WAS A MILLIONAIRE
YOU NEED N'T PLAGUE ME ABOUT IT NOW YOU KNOW IT
BUT HE S DEAD YOU KNOW
MAYBE THAT S WHAT SHE WANTS
OUR ALLIES MUST BE FED
WHAT ARE YOU ALWAYS CUTTING OFF TO POLLY'S FOR I LIKE IT
NOW TELL ALL ABOUT IT BEGAN FANNY WHO WAS FULL OF CURIOSITY ABOUT THE NEW PLAN
I DON'T CARE A BIT FOR HIM AND HE LIKES TRIX
BUT I THINK THAT WOMEN CAN DO A GREAT DEAL FOR EACH OTHER IF THEY WILL ONLY STOP FEARING WHAT PEOPLE WILL THINK AND TAKE A HEARTY INTEREST IN WHATEVER IS GOING TO FIT THEIR SISTERS AND THEMSELVES TO DESERVE AND ENJOY THE RIGHTS GOD GAVE THEM
I TELL HIM TO BREAK HIS ENGAGEMENT AND NOT BE WORRIED SO
AND I KNEW YOU WOULD N'T CARE TO HEAR ABOUT MY DOINGS FOR THEY ARE N'T THE SORT YOU LIKE ANSWERED POLLY
O PULL ME UP FOR MERCY SAKE CRIED SALLY SCRAMBLING TO HER FEET UNHURT BUT A GOOD DEAL SHAKEN
FORTUNATELY THE SHED WAS LOW THE GRASS WAS THICK AND THE TREE BROKE MY FALL BUT I GOT A BAD BUMP AND A TERRIBLE SHAKING
NOT BEING A FOOL OR A COX-COMB SYDNEY PUT THIS AND THAT TOGETHER AND TAKING VARIOUS TRIFLES INTO THE ACCOUNT HE HAD BY THIS TIME COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT POLLY HAD HEARD THE SAME BITS OF GOSSIP THAT HE HAD WHICH LINKED THEIR NAMES TOGETHER THAT SHE DID N'T LIKE IT AND TRIED TO SHOW SHE DID N'T IN THIS WAY
POLLY HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE VERY MISERABLE AND CRY HERSELF TO SLEEP
SHE COULD N'T UNDERSTAND IT EXPLAIN IT OR HELP IT
I NEVER SPEAK OF OUR FONDNESS FOR ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE SUCH THINGS SEEM SILLY TO OTHER PEOPLE
EVERYBODY IS SO KIND SHE SOBBED AND I WAS SO WICKED I DON'T DESERVE IT OH YES YOU DO
I M SURE THERE S SOMETHING VERY NICE ABOUT MR SYDNEY THEY LOOKED SO PLEASED WHEN THEY WHISPERED AND GIGGLED ON THE BED AND THOUGHT I WAS RIPPING BONNETS AND DID N'T HEAR A WORD WHICH LOOKED MOST PLEASED ASKED TOM INVESTIGATING THE KITCHEN BOILER WITH DEEP INTEREST
WE VE ALWAYS HAD THINGS SENT US FROM RICHER FRIENDS AND WHATEVER WAS N'T PROPER FOR US TO WEAR AT THE TIME MOTHER PUT AWAY TO BE USED WHEN WE NEEDED IT
AND WHEN SHE FELL INTO THE SAY SHE WAS BEWILDERED AND COULD ONLY HOWL
WORSE STILL OH TOM YOU HAVE N'T HORSE WHIPPED OR SHOT ANY ONE CAME PRETTY NEAR BLOWING MY OWN BRAINS OUT BUT YOU SEE I DID N'T I CAN'T GUESS
NOW FAN YOUR TURN NEXT WELL I VE A BUNDLE OF OLD LETTERS AND I D LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY STORY ABOUT THEM ANSWERED FANNY HOPING SOME ROMANCE MIGHT BE FORTHCOMING
AS IF HE HAD LEARNED TO CARE FOR SOME ONE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN FOR HIMSELF ANSWERED POLLY WITH SUDDEN COLOR IN HER CHEEKS AND A SUDDEN SOFTENING OF THE VOICE AS HER EYES TURNED AWAY FROM TOM WHO WAS THE PICTURE OF A COMPLACENT DANDY FROM THE TOPMOST CURL OF HIS AUBURN HEAD TO THE TIPS OF HIS ARISTOCRATIC BOOTS
BUT I CAN'T BE FOR HE WAS GOOD YOU KNOW SO ARE YOU WHEN YOU CHOOSE
NOT A BIT
NOT A BIT
NOT A BIT
EVEN HIS VOICE BETRAYED DISTURBANCE FOR INSTEAD OF THE AFFABLE GREETING HE USUALLY BESTOWED UPON THE YOUNG LADY HE SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN BACK INTO THE BLUFF TONE OF HIS BOYISH DAYS AND ALL HE SAID WAS HULLO POLLY HOW DO YOU DO ANSWERED POLLY
HER CLOTHES WON'T COME OFF
IT PUFFETH UP THE HEART OF MAN AND ESPECIALLY OF WOMAN
SHE ONLY KNEW WHICH SHE LIKED BEST AND SUPPOSED IT WAS MERELY ANOTHER OF HER OLD-FASHIONED WAYS
TAKE OFF HER THINGS AND I LL GIVE UP TOM VOUCHSAFED NO REPLY BUT MARCHED TO THE OTHER DOOR WHICH WAS FAST AS POLLY KNEW LOOKED OUT OF THE THREE-STORY WINDOW AND FINDING NO ESCAPE POSSIBLE CAME BACK WITH A WRATHFUL FACE
BUT HE DOES NEED SOME ONE TO LOVE HIM VERY MUCH AND MAKE HIM HAPPY AS A GOOD WOMAN BEST KNOWS HOW SAID POLLY AS IF ANSWERING THE MUTE LANGUAGE OF TOM'S FACE
HOPE YOU LL BE AS WELL PLEASED WITH ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT THAT S COMING OUT BEFORE LONG
BUT WHEN GRANDMA PRAISED HIS FATHER THE YOUNG MAN THOUGHT BETTER OF THE MATTER AND REGARDED THE FLOWERS WITH MORE RESPECT AS HE ASKED WHICH IS FOR WHICH GUESS SAID MR SHAW PLEASED THAT HIS UNUSUAL DEMONSTRATION HAD PRODUCED SUCH AN EFFECT
BUT HE WAS AT THE WINDOW AND DID N'T TURN AS HE SAID SLOWLY WELL YOU SEE HE S SO FOND OF YOU
BUT A VOICE FROM BESS'S CORNER SAID PUT A CHILD IN HER ARMS BECKY NOT THAT EVEN FOR SHE IS TO BE SOMETHING MORE THAN A NURSE GIVE HER A BALLOT-BOX CRIED A NEW VOICE AND TURNING ROUND THEY SAW AN ODD-LOOKING WOMAN PERCHED ON A SOFA BEHIND THEM
LET S GO AND DO IT AGAIN TO-MORROW SAID TOM HOLDING THE HAND FROM WHICH HE HAD HELPED TO PULL A REFRACTORY GLOVE
SHE TRIED TO CONQUER THIS FEELING BUT SHE COULD N'T AND WHEN TRIX PUT ON AIRS POLLY FELT AN INTENSE DESIRE TO BOX HER EARS
LET ME COME TOO I WON'T MAKE ANY FUSS
FOR A MINUTE HER HANDS WANDERED OVER THE KEYS AS IF UNCERTAIN WHAT TO PLAY
BUT SHE DID N'T CARE MUCH FOR MR SHAW SAID LOOKING AT THE THREE BRIGHT FACES AT THE TEA-TABLE I GUESS POLLY HAS BEEN MAKING SUNSHINE FOR YOU TO-DAY NO INDEED SIR I HAVE N'T DONE ANYTHING ONLY DRESS MAUD'S DOLL AND POLLY DID N'T THINK SHE HAD DONE MUCH
HE S TWENTY AND HE SAYS I MUST TREAT HIM WITH RESPECT
EVEN MAUD WAS MUCH BETTER DRESSED THAN HERSELF AND LOOKED VERY SPLENDID IN HER CHERRY-COLORED AND WHITE SUIT WITH A SASH SO BIG SHE COULD HARDLY CARRY IT AND LITTLE WHITE BOOTS WITH RED BUTTONS
I SAID I D GET EM AND I HAVE
AND THERE WAS TOM'S RED HEAD BOBBING UP OVER THE HIGH BACK OF THE CHAIR WHERE HE HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF
A GREAT MAN WAS ONCE HEARD TO SAY THAT WHAT FIRST ATTRACTED HIM TO HIS WELL-BELOVED WIFE WAS SEEING HER IN A WHITE MUSLIN DRESS WITH A BLUE SHAWL ON THE CHAIR BEHIND HER
TOM DID N'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF HER AT FIRST THOUGH HE THOUGHT THE CHANGE UNCOMMONLY BECOMING AND FINALLY DECIDED THAT POLLY HAD TAKEN HIS ADVICE AND WAS SETTING HER CAP FOR SYD AS HE GRACEFULLY EXPRESSED IT
BUT A LITTLE SEED WAS SOWED THEN THAT TOOK ROOT AND THOUGH IT GREW VERY SLOWLY IT CAME TO SOMETHING IN THE END
DON'T YOU BOTHER POLLY
HIS FACE CHANGED AND HE TOOK THE CHUBBY HAND SO GENTLY THAT POLLY PEEPED TO SEE WHAT IT MEANT
YOU VE GOT A SECRET POLLY AND I SHOULD THINK YOU MIGHT TELL IT AS YOU KNOW MINE SAID FANNY UNABLE TO REST TILL EVERYTHING WAS TOLD FOR POLLY'S MANNER TROUBLED HER
DOES IT SEEM LONG EVERLASTING POLLY MEANT TO SAY THAT QUITE EASILY AND SMILE INCREDULOUSLY AT HIS ANSWER
I OUGHT TO BE FULL OF SORROW FOR POOR PAPA AND I AM TRULY SORRY BUT WICKED AS IT MAY SEEM IT S A FACT POLLY THAT I M HALF GLAD IT S HAPPENED FOR IT TAKES ME OUT OF MYSELF AND GIVES ME SOMETHING TO DO FANNY'S EYES FELL AND HER COLOR ROSE AS SHE SPOKE BUT POLLY UNDERSTOOD WHY SHE WANTED TO FORGET HERSELF AND PUT HER ARM ROUND HER WITH A MORE TENDER SYMPATHY THAN FANNY GUESSED
THEY AGREED AND SOON THE THREE WERE WALKING BRISKLY AWAY TO POLLY'S NEW HOME IN A QUIET STREET WHERE A FEW OLD TREES RUSTLED IN THE SUMMER AND THE MORNING SUN SHONE PLEASANTLY IN WINTER TIME
BOOK-SHELVES HUNG OVER THE SOFA A PICTURE OR TWO ON THE WALLS AND A GREAT VASE OF AUTUMN LEAVES AND GRASSES BEAUTIFIED THE LOW CHIMNEY-PIECE
THE QUICK TAP OF FEET BEHIND HIM MADE HIM TURN IN TIME TO SEE A FRESH-FACED LITTLE GIRL RUNNING DOWN THE LONG STATION AND LOOKING AS IF SHE RATHER LIKED IT
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD DO JUST THE SAME IN YOUR PLACE BUT IT SEEMS NOW AS IF I COULD BE VERY HAPPY AND USEFUL WITH PLENTY OF MONEY YOU ARE THAT WITHOUT IT
SO CLEAR THE LUL-LA AND AWAY WENT INDEPENDENT POLLY WITH HER HAIR BLOWING IN THE WIND AND AN EXPRESSION OF GENUINE ENJOYMENT WHICH A VERY RED NOSE DID N'T DAMAGE IN THE LEAST
AND WHILE HE WAITED TO GET HIS POISE AFTER THE DOWNFALL HE WAS SO VERY MISERABLE THAT I M AFRAID IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR ONE THING MY POOR TOM WOULD HAVE GOT DESPERATE AND BEEN A FAILURE
NOTHING MORE WAS SAID
PERHAPS THINGS ARE NOT AS BAD AS THEY SEEM
IT BEGAN EARLY
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF
AS THE GIRLS WERE GOING TO BED ONE NIGHT POLLY KISSED GRANDMA AS USUAL AND FANNY LAUGHED AT HER SAYING WHAT A BABY YOU ARE
ALL READY FOR COMPANY
POLLY WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY SHOWING HIM WHAT IT WAS AND MAKING CHILD-LOVE SO SWEET THAT HE FELT HE COULD NOT DO WITHOUT IT ANY MORE YET DID N'T QUITE KNOW HOW TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAD ALWAYS FOUND HIM BUSY INDIFFERENT AND ABSENTMINDED
HUSH
HUSH
OF COURSE I WILL
BUT REALLY POLLY I HAVE N'T THE HEART TO ASK PAPA FOR A CENT JUST NOW AND YET I MUST HAVE CLOTHES
TO SAVE NOT SPEND
MAMMA IS SO FEEBLE I SHALL HAVE TO KEEP HOUSE I SUPPOSE AND YOU MUST SHOW ME HOW POLLY SAID FAN
IF HE COULD HAVE HEARD HER LAUGH AND FANNY'S REMARKS HIS WRATH WOULD HAVE BOILED OVER
WELL HE WAS A TRUMP ANYWAY SO WHY NOT CALL HIM ONE ASKED TOM FEELING THAT THE OBJECTIONABLE WORD WAS ALL THAT COULD BE DESIRED
YOU KNEW THIS AND YET DISOBEYED ME I HARDLY EVER SEE HIM BEGAN FANNY
I NEVER SHALL FORGET HOW B-E-A-UTIFULLY SHE LOOKED AS SHE SAT IN STATE ON THE FRONT PARLOR SOPHY RIGHT UNDER A GREAT PORTRAIT OF HER FIRST HUSBAND
WHY ARE BAD BOYS LIKE CAKE ASKED POLLY ANXIOUS TO CHEER HIM UP
SHE LOVES TO GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND MESS SHE HATES TO STUDY AND SAID RIGHT BEFORE THE VINCENTS THAT SHE SHOULD THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT FUN TO BE A BEGGAR-GIRL TO GO ROUND WITH A BASKET IT MUST BE SO INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT YOU D GET MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PUDDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBERS BY THE WAY WHEN IS HER UNCLE COMING BACK ASKED FANNY WHO COULD N'T WAIT ANY LONGER AND JOYFULLY SEIZED THE OPENING POLLY MADE FOR HER
TO DRESS UP AND PARADE CERTAIN STREETS FOR AN HOUR EVERY DAY TO STAND TALKING IN DOORWAYS OR DRIVE OUT IN A FINE CARRIAGE WAS NOT THE SORT OF EXERCISE SHE LIKED AND FAN WOULD TAKE NO OTHER
COMING HOME LATE HE LIKED TO SEE A CURLY BROWN HEAD WATCHING AT THE WINDOW
COME NOW DOES SHE YES SHE DOES
MAUD AND FANNY AGREED AND GRANDMA LOOKED SO GRATIFIED BY THEIR THANKS THAT TOM FOLLOWED SUIT MERELY WAITING TILL THOSE GIRLS WERE OUT OF SIGHT TO GIVE THE OLD LADY A HEARTY HUG AND A KISS ON THE VERY CHEEK LAFAYETTE HAD SALUTED
GRANDMA WAS RATHER NEGLECTED TOO AND PERHAPS THAT IS THE REASON WHY TOM AND SHE WERE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS
SUCH FUN AS WE USED TO HAVE UP IN OUR BIG GARRET
THE BUTTON CAME OFF THE OLD COAT YOU INSISTED ON WEARING AFTER THE FAILURE AS IF IT WAS YOUR DUTY TO LOOK AS SHABBY AS POSSIBLE AND THE CURL I STOLE FROM MAUD
WHERE ARE YOU GOING DEAR TO SEE TRIX OF COURSE
BESIDES POOR TOM HAD NO ONE ELSE TO HELP HIM
BUT AS SPRING CAME ON THE SEED OF NEW VIRTUES PLANTED IN THE WINTER TIME AND RIPENED BY THE SUNSHINE OF ENDEAVOR BEGAN TO BUD IN POLLY'S NATURE BETRAYING THEIR PRESENCE TO OTHERS BY THE ADDED STRENGTH AND SWEETNESS OF HER CHARACTER LONG BEFORE SHE HERSELF DISCOVERED THESE MAY FLOWERS THAT HAD BLOSSOMED FOR HER UNDERNEATH THE SNOW
OH POLLY THOUGH I VE WAITED AND HOPED SO LONG I COULD N'T BELIEVE IT WHEN IT CAME AND DON'T DESERVE IT
I M PROPER GLAD TO FIND YOU LOOKING SO WELL AND HAPPY
I DON'T THINK I GOT ON MUCH
I LL GIVE YOU A CONUNDRUM TO LIGHTEN YOUR LABOR
THIS LOVE AND THOUGHT AND CARE FOR THOSE WEAKER POORER OR WORSE THAN OURSELVES WHICH WE CALL CHRISTIAN CHARITY IS A VERY OLD FASHION MY DEAR
OH YES
OH YES
OH YES
POLLY DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SECRET OF THIS WAS THE FACT THAT TOM OFTEN HELD HER UP AS A MODEL FOR HIS FIANCE TO FOLLOW WHICH CAUSED THAT YOUNG LADY TO DISLIKE HER MORE THAN EVER
T IS N'T NOTHING
BUT AS HE TURNED INTO THE MALL THERE WAS THE ROUND HAT AND UNDER IT THE BRIGHT FACE LOOKING ALL THE ROSIER FOR BEING POWDERED WITH SNOW-FLAKES AS POLLY CAME RUNNING TO MEET HIM
NO MATTER ABOUT YOUR PROMISE
SUCH A REMARKABLE PIE AS IT WAS TOO FOR IN SPITE OF ALL ITS WANDERINGS IT NEVER GOT SPILT OR BROKEN AND WE FINALLY ATE IT FOR LUNCH IN ORDER TO BE LEFT IN PEACE
WE WERE JUST BEGINNING ON THE CAKE WHEN THE LOUD SCRATCHING OF A RAT DISTURBED US
I M FRIGHTENED OUT OF MY WITS WHEN HE SPEAKS LIKE THAT
SHE SOON FOUND THAT EVEN THE NEW BLACK SILK WAS N'T FINE ENOUGH FOR FANNY'S SMALLEST PARTY AND AFTER RECEIVING A FEW OF THE EXPRESSIVE GLANCES BY WHICH WOMEN CONVEY THEIR OPINION OF THEIR NEIGHBOR'S TOILET AND OVERHEARING A JOKE OR TWO ABOUT THAT INEVITABLE DRESS AND THE LITTLE BLACKBIRD POLLY FOLDED AWAY THE ONCE TREASURED FROCK SAYING WITH A CHOKE IN HER VOICE
HE NEEDS IT ENOUGH ALL ALONE THERE
DEAR MRS
YOU WILL HOLD YOUR TONGUE WON'T YOU YES
BUT WAS SO IN THE HABIT OF HELPING ANY ONE WHO SEEMED IN TROUBLE THAT SHE WAS GOOD TO HIM SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE COULD N'T HELP IT
NOTHING BUT COAST HE SAID GRUFFLY FOR PAPA WAS ALWAYS LECTURING HIM AND LETTING THE GIRLS DO JUST AS THEY LIKED
SHE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER WOMAN WHOSE DRESS NEVER WAS TOO FINE FOR LITTLE WET CHEEKS TO LIE AGAINST OR LOVING LITTLE ARMS TO PRESS
SHE LIKED MR SYDNEY VERY MUCH FOR HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN KIND AND FRIENDLY SINCE THE EARLY TIMES WHEN HE HAD TREATED THE LITTLE GIRL WITH A COURTESY WHICH THE YOUNG WOMAN GRATEFULLY REMEMBERED
ALL LIVED TO BE GRANDMOTHERS AND FATHERS
PUTTEL WHEN MISSIS ABUSES YOU PLAY IT S DYSPEPSIA AND DON'T BEAR MALICE BECAUSE IT S A VERY TRYING DISEASE MY DEAR THEN GOING BACK TO HER THOUGHTS SHE RAMBLED ON AGAIN
HE IS N'T ONLY HE DID N'T THINK HOW IT SEEMED TO ME AND I DON'T WONDER HE WAS A LITTLE AFRAID MR SHAW IS SO SEVERE WITH THE POOR FELLOW
DROP ALL THIS NONSENSE AND ATTEND TO YOUR BOOKS OR OFF YOU GO
AND WHEN SHE WOUND UP WITH A HEALTH TO KING CHARLIE THE ROOM QUITE RUNG WITH THE STIRRING MUSIC MADE BY THE BIG PIANO AND THE LITTLE MAID
SHE S GONE NOW BUT SOMEHOW POLLY YOU SEEM TO TAKE HER PLACE
FAN DON'T CARE FOR ANYBODY BUT HERSELF SAID TOM
THE WOMAN WHO DID NOT DARE POLLY WROTE ENTHUSIASTICALLY NED ANSWERED SATISFACTORILY AND AFTER MUCH CORRESPONDING TALKING AND PLANNING IT WAS DECIDED THAT TOM SHOULD GO WEST
BUT I DON'T NOW
I SAY POLLY WON'T YOU GIVE SOME OF US FELLOWS MUSIC LESSONS
FEW OF US DO THAT EVEN IN THE PARLOR
SHE IS N'T A BIT OF A YOUNG LADY THANK GOODNESS
AND WITH AN ODD LAUGH TOM CARRIED SYDNEY OFF TO HIS DEN LEAVING THE GIRLS TO TELEGRAPH TO ONE ANOTHER THE AWFUL MESSAGE IT IS MARIA BAILEY HOW SHE MANAGED TO GET THROUGH THAT EVENING POLLY NEVER KNEW YET IT WAS NOT A LONG ONE FOR AT EIGHT O'CLOCK SHE SLIPPED OUT OF THE ROOM MEANING TO RUN HOME ALONE AND NOT COMPEL ANY ONE TO SERVE AS ESCORT
COULD N'T WE GIVE UP A FEW OF THE VANITIES AND PAY THE SEAMSTRESSES BETTER I DECLARE I WILL CRIED BELLE WHOSE CONSCIENCE SUDDENLY WOKE AND SMOTE HER FOR BEATING DOWN THE WOMAN WHO DID HER PLAIN SEWING IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE AN EXTRA FLOUNCE ON A NEW DRESS
TOM A TRIFLE PENSIVE BUT DISTRESSINGLY POLITE AND POLLY MAGNANIMOUSLY FRIENDLY TO EVERY ONE
AND IF I SEE ANY MORE OF IT I LL SEND YOU TO SCHOOL IN A CANADIAN CONVENT THIS AWFUL THREAT QUITE TOOK POLLY'S BREATH AWAY
I LL HAVE AN APRON WITH A BIB TO IT LIKE POLLY'S AND A FEATHER DUSTER AND SWEEP THE STAIRS MAYBE WITH MY HEAD TIED UP LIKE KATY
IT WOULD BE EASIER TO SCRATCH GRAVEL ON A RAILROAD WITH A GANG OF PADDIES THAN TO SELL PINS TO MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
DON'T YOU FORGET NOW SAID THE BOY LOOKING BASHFULLY INTO THE BRIGHT EYES THAT DANCED WITH PLEASURE AS THE GIRL BLUSHED AND SMILED AND ANSWERED REPROACHFULLY
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND IT IS N'T PROPER FOR US TO GO POKING INTO DIRTY PLACES TO HUNT UP THE NEEDY
HE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN ME LAST YEAR HE TOLD ME BUT YOU SAID GOOD THINGS ABOUT ME AND THOUGH HE DID N'T CARE MUCH THEN YET WHEN HE LOST YOU AND CAME BACK TO ME HE FOUND THAT YOU WERE NOT ALTOGETHER MISTAKEN AND HE HAS WATCHED ME ALL THIS WINTER LEARNING TO RESPECT AND LOVE ME BETTER EVERY DAY
BELLE BEING OF THE DEMONSTRATIVE SORT SMILED AND NODDED DREW UP HER CHAIR AND BEGAN A WHISPERED ACCOUNT OF TRIX'S LAST QUARREL WITH TOM
FOR FAN DID N'T OFFER TO GO WITH HER MAUD KEPT DODGING ABOUT WITH SOMETHING UNDER HER APRON AND TOM HAD JUST WHISKED INTO HIS MOTHER'S ROOM IN A MYSTERIOUS MANNER
BUT GIRLS TONGUES CAN DEAL WOUNDS AS SHARP AND SUDDEN AS THE SLENDER STILETTO SPANISH WOMEN WEAR IN THEIR HAIR AND POLLY TURNED PALE AS THOSE WORDS STABBED HER
HE LAUGHED AND SAID AS HE PERCHED HIMSELF ON THE POST OF THE BANISTERS I WON'T GRAB YOU HONOR BRIGHT
BUT HER ATTENTION WAS SPEEDILY DIVERTED BY THE SQUABBLE GOING ON IN THE CORNER
I ADORE GUY LIVINGSTON'S BOOKS AND YATES'S
DID N'T EXPECT YOU WOULD I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
YOU HAVE SEEN TWO OF MY NEW FRIENDS MISS MILLS AND JENNY NOW I LL SHOW YOU TWO MORE SAID POLLY PRESENTLY AS THEY REACHED A DOOR AND SHE LED THE WAY UP SEVERAL FLIGHTS OF PUBLIC STAIRS
NOW LET HER PAY HER DEBTS AND HAVE THE SAME PLEASURE IF SHE LOOKS AT IT IN THAT WAY IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
SO IT IS BUT THIS IS A LITTLE LABOR OF LOVE AND DOES N'T SPOIL THE DAY AT ALL
SO SHE HELD HER TONGUE AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT ALL THE MORE
POLLY SHOOK HER HEAD DECIDEDLY
TRIX SAW HER FIRST AND SUDDENLY BECAME ABSORBED IN THE DISTANT HORIZON
IT S SPLENDID
BUT WHEN HE SEEMED MOST USELESS OUTCAST AND FORLORN HE DISCOVERED THAT ONE PERSON NEEDED HIM ONE PERSON NEVER FOUND HIM IN THE WAY ONE PERSON ALWAYS WELCOMED AND CLUNG TO HIM WITH THE STRONGEST AFFECTION OF A VERY FEEBLE NATURE
MY LITTLE POLLY IS BEGINNING EARLY AFTER ALL SAID MR SHAW LAUGHING AS HE WATCHED THE GIRL'S FACE DIMPLE AND FLUSH AS SHE SMELT THE LOVELY NOSEGAY AND GLANCED AT A NOTE HALF HIDDEN IN THE HELIOTROPE
NOW DON'T GO AND REPEAT THAT CHATTERBOX MY GOODNESS IS N'T SHE CROSS WHISPERED MAUD TO TOM
WAS IT REGRET FOR THE CONQUEST SHE RELINQUISHED WAS IT SYMPATHY FOR HER FRIEND OR WAS IT AN UNCONTROLLABLE OVERFLOW OF FEELING AS SHE READ SOME SAD OR TENDER PASSAGE OF THE LITTLE ROMANCE WHICH SHE KEPT HIDDEN AWAY IN HER OWN HEART
I HOPED YOU D LIKE THEM I KNEW THEY D DO YOU GOOD AND I LL TAKE YOU ANY TIME FOR YOU STOOD THE TEST BETTER THAN I EXPECTED
IT DOES SEEM SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE AGAIN SAID MAUD CUDDLING POLLY'S COLD HAND AS SHE SAT AT HER FEET WHEN SHE WAS FAIRLY ESTABLISHED BETWEEN FANNY AND MR SHAW WHILE TOM LEANED ON THE BACK OF HIS MOTHER'S CHAIR AND ENJOYED THE PROSPECT
THEN SHE TURNED TO MAUD FOR COMPANIONSHIP FOR HER OWN LITTLE SISTER WAS EXCELLENT COMPANY AND POLLY LOVED HER DEARLY
THEY HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR FOR POLLY WAS SAYING IN HER MOST IMPRESSIVE MANNER WELL WHATEVER YOU DO WILL DON'T HAVE A GREAT COSTLY CHURCH THAT TAKES SO MUCH MONEY TO BUILD AND SUPPORT IT THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO GIVE AWAY
BUT IT S MEANT TO GET SOME PRESENTS FOR THE CHILDREN AND POLLY TOOK OUT HER PURSE IN AN UNDECIDED WAY
DO YOU GET TIRED OF OLD FRIENDS TOO MISS POLLY NOT OFTEN
WISE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS AND EVERYBODY IS MORE INFLUENCED BY IT THAN THEY KNOW PERHAPS
A DOZEN YELLOW NOTES WRITTEN ON ROUGH THICK PAPER WITH RED WAFERS STILL ADHERING TO THE FOLDS SHOWING PLAINLY THAT THEY WERE WRITTEN BEFORE THE DAY OF INITIAL NOTE-PAPER AND SELF-SEALING ENVELOPES
OH NO CRIED POLLY EARNESTLY
BUT TRIX IS GETTING PASSE AND I SHOULD N'T WONDER IF SHE KEPT HIM TO HIS WORD JUST OUT OF PERVERSITY IF NOTHING ELSE POOR TOM WHAT A FATE SAID POLLY WITH WHAT WAS MEANT TO BE A COMICAL GROAN
NOW TOM HOW COULD I KNOW YOU LOVED ME WHEN YOU WENT AWAY AND NEVER SAID A WORD SHE BEGAN IN A TENDERLY REPROACHFUL TONE THINKING OF THE HARD YEAR SHE HAD SPENT
HE WAS NOT MUCH GIVEN TO REFLECTION BUT OCCASIONALLY INDULGED WHEN SOMETHING GAVE HIM A TURN IN THAT DIRECTION AND AT SUCH TIMES HE WAS AS SOBER AND SINCERE AS COULD BE DESIRED
SHE HAS GOT A SENSIBLE MOTHER I THOUGHT SO AND SYDNEY SIGHED FOR HE HAD LATELY LOST HIS OWN GOOD MOTHER
THERE S CLARA BIRD
MRS SHAW A PALE NERVOUS WOMAN GREETED HER LITTLE GUEST KINDLY AND TOOK CARE THAT SHE WANTED FOR NOTHING
QUANTITIES OF THINGS BEGAN FAN AND THEN STOPPED FOR SOMEHOW SHE FELT ASHAMED TO OWN THAT SHE WAS AFFLICTED BECAUSE SHE COULD N'T HAVE A NEW SET OF FURS GO TO PARIS IN THE SPRING AND MAKE MR SYDNEY LOVE HER
BUT WE DID N'T
BLESS ME HOW RUDE NOT TO INTRODUCE YOU
I WAS N'T FREE YOU KNOW AND BESIDES I HAD A STRONG IMPRESSION THAT YOU LIKED SYDNEY IN SPITE OF THE DAMPER WHICH FAN HINTED YOU GAVE HIM LAST WINTER
I KNEW YOU WERE VERY GOOD TO HIM YOU ARE TO EVERY ONE MY PRECIOUS
FOR THE NEW HELP NOT BEING A HIGH-PRICED ARTICLE COULD NOT BE DEPENDED ON FOR DESSERTS AND MRS SHAW WOULD HAVE FELT AS IF THE WOLF WAS AT THE DOOR IF THERE WAS NOT A SWEET DISH AT DINNER
POLLY SYDNEY DON'T SOUND WELL AND MRS ARTHUR SYDNEY DON'T SEEM TO FIT ME A BIT
WILL YOU KISS AND BE FRIENDS IF I TROT HER DOWN ASKED TOM REMEMBERING HIS FELLOW-SINNER
HE S VERY KIND TO ME AND I ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS HE LIKES YOU BETTER THAN HE DOES ME NOW TOM
WILL THEY TAKE ALL MY THINGS AWAY CRIED MAUD IN DISMAY
IS THAT THE TROUBLE SHE HAS BEEN HIDING ALL WINTER
RIGHT MY LITTLE POLLY AND MR SHAW STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO HER WITH SUCH A KINDLY LOOK THAT FANNY STARED SURPRISED AND THEN SAID SHYLY I THOUGHT YOU DID N'T CARE ABOUT IT FATHER I DO MY DEAR AND MR SHAW PUT OUT THE OTHER HAND TO FANNY WHO GAVE HIM A DAUGHTERLY KISS QUITE FORGETTING EVERYTHING BUT THE TENDER FEELING THAT SPRUNG UP IN HER HEART AT THE RENEWAL OF THE CHILDISH CUSTOM WHICH WE NEVER NEED OUTGROW
MISS TRIX IS EQUAL TO THAT SORT OF THING BUT IT IS N'T LIKE TOM FOR WITH ALL HIS FOPPERY HE IS A GOOD FELLOW AT HEART AS MR SYDNEY SAID THIS POLLY HELD OUT HER HAND WITH A HEARTY THANK YOU FOR THAT THE YOUNG MAN SHOOK THE LITTLE HAND IN THE GRAY WOOLLEN GLOVE GAVE HER EXACTLY THE SAME BOW WHICH HE DID THE HONORABLE MRS DAVENPORT AND WENT AWAY LEAVING POLLY TO WALK UP STAIRS AND ADDRESS PUTTEL WITH THE PECULIAR REMARK YOU ARE A TRUE GENTLEMAN
I WONDER IF THAT S POLLY UP CAME THE LITTLE GIRL WITH HER HAND OUT AND A HALF-SHY HALF-MERRY LOOK IN HER BLUE EYES AS SHE SAID INQUIRINGLY THIS IS TOM IS N'T IT YES
SARAH I COMMAND YOU TO TELL ME WHAT THIS ALL MEANS BUT SALLY ONLY SIGHED IN HER SLEEP AND MUTTERED WICKEDLY MA TAKE ME HOME
DON'T LOOK AT ME TILL I M RESPECTABLE AND DON'T TELL ANY ONE HOW I VE BEEN ACTING
THE WHITE DOWN-TRIMMED CLOAK WITH CERTAIN IMPOSING ORNAMENTS ON THE HOOD WAS ASSUMED WITH BECOMING GRAVITY AND DRAPED WITH MUCH ADVANCING AND RETREATING BEFORE THE GLASS AS ITS WEARER PRACTISED THE TRUE BOSTON GAIT ELBOWS BACK SHOULDERS FORWARD A BEND AND A SLIDE OCCASIONALLY VARIED BY A SLIGHT SKIP
TRIX THINKS I M GOING TO WEAR BLUE SO SHE HAS GOT A GREEN ONE AND TOLD BELLE IT WOULD SPOIL THE EFFECT OF MINE AS WE ARE MUCH TOGETHER OF COURSE
I LL KEEP MY PROMISE IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING BUT IT WILL BE HARD TO SEE THINGS GOING WRONG WHEN A WORD WOULD SET IT RIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU DO AND POLLY LOOKED SO THREATENING THAT FAN TREMBLED BEFORE HER DISCOVERING THAT THE GENTLEST GIRLS WHEN ROUSED ARE MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN ANY SHREW
YOU ARE JUST WHAT I WANT POLLY
AND THIS DOZY CAT IS CALLED ASHPUTTEL BECAUSE THE JOY OF HER LIFE IS TO GET AMONG THE CINDERS
LITTLE THINGS OF THIS SORT ARE ESPECIALLY GOOD WORK FOR LITTLE PEOPLE
AND WHEN HE EMERGED POLLY WAS SITTING UP LOOKING AS MUCH BETTER FOR HER SHOWER AS HE DID FOR HIS MOMENTARY ECLIPSE
HE S DONE HIS BEST
THE GIRLS ALL DO AND SAY I OUGHT TO HAVE FWEDDY LOVELL
THAT WAS NOT THE TIME TO SPEAK OF IT BUT POLLY RESOLVED TO STAND READY TO OFFER SYMPATHY IF NOTHING MORE WHENEVER THE CONFIDENTIAL MINUTE CAME
POLLY'S TROUBLES CHAPTER 4
BUT WOMEN ARE QUEER CREATURES AND THERE S NO ACCOUNTING FOR THEIR TASTES SAID POLLY WITH A SLY LOOK WHICH TOM FULLY APPRECIATED
POLLY WAS NOT VERY WISE BUT SHE FELT THAT EVERY ONE ABOUT HER FOUND SOMETHING MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN USUAL IN HER AND MODESTLY ATTRIBUTED TOM'S DEVOTION SYDNEY'S INTEREST AND FRANK'S UNDISGUISED ADMIRATION TO THE NEW BONNET OR MORE LIKELY TO THAT DELIGHTFUL COMBINATION OF CASHMERE SILK AND SWAN'S-DOWN WHICH LIKE CHARITY'S MANTLE SEEMED TO COVER A MULTITUDE OF SINS IN OTHER PEOPLE'S EYES AND EXALT THE LITTLE MUSIC TEACHER TO THE RANK OF A YOUNG LADY
BUT THEY DID N'T KNOW HALF HOW WISE HE WAS BECAUSE HE DID N'T SHOW OFF A BIT
IF I HAD LOTS OF THINGS LIKE FAN I D HAVE AN AUCTION AND GET ALL I COULD FOR THEM
I M AWFUL SORRY I HURT YOU
WHY POLLY TOM IS N'T A BOY
THE DOOR WAS AJAR AND PAUSING IN THE DARK ENTRY TOM TOOK A SURVEY BEFORE HE WENT IN
MOTHER WOULD BE SO ANXIOUS IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO ME SO FAR AWAY CRIED POLLY MUCH DISTRESSED
HE ALWAYS DOES STAND UP FOR THE CRUSHED ONES AND THAT S GOOD OF HIM I ALLOW
HOW EARLY THE OLD STORY BEGINS IT SEEMED AS IF THE SPRING WEATHER HAD BROUGHT OUT ALL MANNER OF TENDER THINGS BESIDE FRESH GRASS AND THE FIRST DANDELIONS FOR AS SHE WENT DOWN THE STREET POLLY KEPT SEEING DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SWEET OLD STORY WHICH SHE WAS TRYING TO FORGET
UP BEFORE SIX AND THINK IT LATE TO GO TO BED AT TEN
THEN HER EYE WENT TO THE UNFINISHED STATUE AND SHE SAID IMPULSIVELY I HOPE YOU LL PUT THAT IN MARBLE AND SHOW US WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE I WISH I COULD AND AN INTENSE DESIRE SHONE IN REBECCA'S FACE AS SHE SAW HER FAULTY WORK AND FELT HOW FAIR HER MODEL WAS
THAT S INDEPENDENT AND MAKES US FEEL BETTER BUT THAT DEAR WOMAN DOES A THOUSAND THINGS THAT MONEY CAN'T PAY FOR AND WE FEEL HER INFLUENCE ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE
I AM SORRY TO SAY I WAS ONE OF THE RINGLEADERS
WHERE IS YOUR NEST
I SHALL SOON BRIGHTEN UP WHEN I GET TO MY WORK AGAIN ANSWERED POLLY BUSTLING ABOUT TO PUT AWAY HER THINGS
I FOUND IT IN MY LAP THEN ON THE FLOOR NEXT UPSIDE DOWN AMONG THE BOOKS THEN JUST ON THE POINT OF COASTING OFF A TRUNK INTO THE ROAD AND AT LAST IT LANDED IN MY ROCKING-CHAIR
WHY SHOULD N'T I ENJOY MYSELF AS WELL AS THE REST
IF I COULD ONLY DO ANYTHING TO HELP CRIED POLLY OPPRESSED WITH HER OWN POWERLESSNESS
YOU ACT SO HOW CAN HE ASKED POLLY AFTER A PAUSE IN WHICH SHE PUT TOM'S QUESTION TO HERSELF AND COULD FIND NO BETTER REPLY THAN THE ONE SHE GAVE HIM
THE YOUNGER GIRLS WALKED UP AND DOWN THE COURT ARM IN ARM EATING BREAD AN BUTTER
AS THE SWING CAME DOWN AFTER SOME DOZEN QUICK JOURNEYS TO AND FRO POLLY SEEMED TO HAVE FOUND A SMILE SOMEWHERE UP ALOFT FOR SHE LOOKED TOWARD FAN SAYING PLEASANTLY AS SHE PAUSED A LITTLE IN HER AIRY EXERCISE I M NOT MAD NOW SHALL I COME AND TOSS WITH YOU NO I LL COME AND SWING WITH YOU ANSWERED FANNY QUICK TO FEEL THE GENEROUS SPIRIT OF HER FRIEND
IT S JUST OUT AND WE DON'T LIKE IT VERY WELL OBSERVED FANNY WHO WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO BE ENGAGED FIRST HERSELF
BUT FANNY WHO SLEPT WITH HER LAY AWAKE LONGER THAN USUAL THINKING ABOUT HER TROUBLES FOR HER HEAD ACHED AND THE DISSATISFACTION THAT FOLLOWS ANGER WOULD NOT LET HER REST WITH THE TRANQUILLITY THAT MADE THE ROSY FACE IN THE LITTLE ROUND NIGHTCAP SUCH A PLEASANT SIGHT TO SEE AS IT LAY BESIDE HER
WHILE JACK AND I MOUNTED GUARD HE WITH THE PISTOL AND I WITH A HATCHET FOR I DID N'T LIKE FIRE-ARMS
HAD GIVEN A SOMEWHAT SCORNFUL SNIFF AT FIRST
IT WAS ALL THE DOINGS OF THAT HORRID TRIX
HASTILY WIPING THE TRAITOROUS EYES SHE LAUGHED AND SAID CHEERFULLY THERE I M ALL RIGHT AGAIN
I M AFRAID I VE GOT A SPICE OF IT AND IF I HAD THE CHANCE SHOULD BE AS BAD AS ANY OF THEM
BUT I LIKE THOSE BOYS OVER THERE AND I LL DANCE WITH ANY OF THEM IF THEY ARE WILLING SAID POLLY AFTER A SURVEY
I FEEL JUST LIKE HAVING A REGULAR GOOD TIME CRIED POLLY WHEN SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAT HANGING ROUND HER NECK AND HER HAIR LOOKING AS IF SHE HAD BEEN OUT IN A HIGH WIND
I HOPE THE PLUMS WON'T ALL BE AT THE BOTTOM SAID POLLY AS SHE ROSE TO DO THE HONORS OF THE CAKE BY UNIVERSAL APPOINTMENT
SHE USED TO BEG HIM NOT TO PLAGUE HER
YOU DON'T MEAN YOU VE KEPT THAT FRIGHTFUL GUY OF A BOY ALL THIS TIME
IT WAS A LOVELY BRIGHT DAY AND I ENJOYED THE RIDE IMMENSELY FOR WE HAD ALL SORTS OF ADVENTURES OH TELL ABOUT IT BEGGED MAUD WHEN THE GENERAL LAUGH AT POLLY'S PICTURE HAD SUBSIDED
TELL ME QUICK WELL I M EXPELLED TOM PAUSED ON THE RUG AS HE GAVE THE ANSWER AND LOOKED AT POLLY TO SEE HOW SHE TOOK IT
HURRAH
HURRAH
O TAKE ME HOME MOANED SALLY TOSSING HER ARMS AND GURGLING LIKE A NAUGHTY LITTLE GYPSY
POLLY REPEATED IT AND ADDED I ASKED HIM IN ANOTHER LETTER IF HE DID N'T ADMIRE MISS B
LOVE A QUICK COLOR CAME TO POLLY'S CHEEKS AS SHE LAUGHED AND SAID LOOKING AWAY NO
THE DULL DAY BRIGHTENED WONDERFULLY AFTER THAT AND THE TIME FLEW PLEASANTLY AS TONGUES AND NEEDLES WENT TOGETHER
PERHAPS I WILL BY AND BY
JUST ONE MORE
THIS WAS NOT ALL THE DAMAGE EITHER FOR AUNT FAINTED WITH THE FRIGHT MOTHER CUT HER HAND WITH A BROKEN LAMP THE CHILDREN TOOK COLD HOPPING ABOUT ON THE WET STAIRS JIP BARKED HIMSELF SICK I SPRAINED MY ANKLE AND JACK NOT ONLY SMASHED A LOOKING-GLASS WITH HIS BULLETS BUT SPOILT HIS PISTOL BY THE HEAVY CHARGE PUT IN IT
TRIX IS MAD AND FAN IN THE DUMPS SO I LL TAKE MYSELF OFF
ANOTHER NEW BONNET
NOT AS COSTLY AS FORMERLY PERHAPS BUT INFINITELY DEARER AS TOKENS OF THE LOVE THAT HAD OUTLIVED THE CHANGE AND ONLY GROWN THE WARMER FOR THE TEST OF MISFORTUNE
OF COURSE HE LOVES YOU EVER SO MUCH MORE THAN HE DOES ME CRIED POLLY REPROVINGLY
I SHALL KEEP MY WORD AND SEE THAT SHE IS N'T SLIGHTED AT MY PARTY FOR I WANT HER TO LOVE ME AND GO HOME FEELING ALL RIGHT THIS ARTFUL SPEECH MADE AN IMPRESSION ON THE REBELLIOUS THOMAS WHO GLANCED AT POLLY'S HAPPY FACE REMEMBERED HIS PROMISE AND WITH A GROAN RESOLVED TO DO HIS DUTY
OH SUCH A SPLENDID TIME CRIED POLLY WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC LITTLE GESTURE AS SHE CHASSED INTO THE CORNER WHERE HE STOOD
BUT FAN INSISTED ON IT FOR FEAR YOU D BE OFFENDED IF I DID N'T GO THE FIRST DANCE WITH YOU SAID TOM REMORSEFULLY WATCHING POLLY AS SHE SETTLED THE BOW OF HER CRUSHED SASH WHICH TOM HAD USED AS A SORT OF HANDLE BY WHICH TO TURN AND TWIST HER
I M GLAD MY VISIT IS MOST DONE FOR THINGS WORRY ME HERE AND THERE IS N'T ANY ONE TO HELP ME GET RIGHT WHEN I GET WRONG
OTHERS STAYED IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM TO READ AND GOSSIP
JUST AS SHE SPOKE A RIPE PLUM DROPPED BOUNCE ON THE GRASS BEFORE US AS IF ANSWERING HER QUESTION
THERE S THE BELL
A SUDDEN PAUSE SEEMED TO FOLLOW TOM'S EJACULATION THEN MR SHAW TALKED A LONG TIME IN A LOW EARNEST TONE SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ANGRY ONE POLLY HAD EXPECTED TO HEAR THAT IT MADE HER NERVOUS FOR MR SHAW USUALLY BLEW TOM UP FIRST AND FORGAVE HIM AFTERWARD AS MAUD SAID
I CAN'T MAKE SKATES FOR NED NOR A DESK FOR WILL
TRIX HAS TRIED FOR YEARS TO FASCINATE HIM AND HE CAN'T BEAR HER AND I M SO GLAD
A FEW PAGES FARTHER BACK CAME FANNY AND MR FRANK CARICATURED
POLLY LOOKED CAREFULLY ROUND TO SEE THAT NO FASHIONABLE EYE BEHELD THE AWFUL DEED AND FINDING ALL SAFE SETTLED HER FREIGHT AND SPUN AWAY DOWN HILL FEELING ALL OVER THE DELIGHTSOME EXCITEMENT OF SWIFT MOTION WHICH MAKES COASTING SUCH A FAVORITE PASTIME WITH THE MORE SENSIBLE PORTION OF THE CHILD-WORLD
LITTLE COMMISSION FOR MOTHER NICE DAY IS N'T IT TOM RATHER BROKE DOWN AT THE END OF HIS SPEECH FOR THE LOOK OF PLEASED SURPRISE WITH WHICH HIS FATHER GREETED HIM THE ALACRITY WITH WHICH HE ACCEPTED AND LEANED ON THE STRONG ARM OFFERED HIM PROVED THAT THE DAILY WALKS HAD BEEN SOLITARY AND DOUBTLESS SAD ONES
FANNY LAUGHED GOOD-NATUREDLY SAYING AS SHE CLASPED HER NECKLACE IF I HAD SUCH SHOULDERS AS YOURS I SHOULD N'T CARE WHAT THE FASHION WAS
BUT DON'T YOU LOVE HIM POLLY NO TRULY TRULY FAN NEITHER SPOKE FOR A MINUTE BUT THE HEART OF ONE OF THEM BEAT JOYFULLY AND THE DUSK HID A VERY HAPPY FACE
THIS LEAVES VERY LITTLE TIME FOR OUR DRIVES SHOPPING AND CALLS BEFORE DINNER AT EIGHT AND THEN THE EVENING GAYETIES BEGIN AGAIN
YOU NEED REST AND PETTING AND HERE I VE BEEN SCOLDING YOU WHEN I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN EXTRA KIND
I POUR IT INTO THE BUTTERED PAN YOU SEE AND IT COOLS AND THEN WE CAN EAT IT EXPLAINED POLLY SUITING THE ACTION TO THE WORD
YOU KNOW I VE LOST ONE BROTHER AND WILL TAKES JIMMY'S PLACE TO ME NOW THE TEARS IN POLLY'S EYES AS SHE SAID THAT MADE TOM VOW A TREMENDOUS VOW WITHIN HIMSELF TO STAND BY WILL THROUGH THICK AND THIN AND KEEP HIM STRAIGHT FOR POLLY'S SAKE
I THOUGHT MOTHER WOULD KILL HERSELF WITH LAUGHING
TOM WAS A PEPPER-POT AS TO TEMPER AND ANYTHING LIKE OPPOSITION ALWAYS HAD A BAD EFFECT
THIS STUDIO IS THEIR HOME THEY WORK EAT SLEEP AND LIVE HERE GOING HALVES IN EVERYTHING
NEXT MY KITTY GOT AWAY AND I HAD A CHASE OVER WALLS AND BROOKS BEFORE I GOT HER WHILE MR BROWN SAT SHAKING WITH FUN TO SEE ME RUN
IT S SNOWING HARD AND FATHER WON'T BE HOME WITH THE CARRIAGE TILL THIS EVENING
AH THAT S A MOTHER THOUGHT POLLY AS THE MEMORY CAME WARM INTO HER HEART MAKING HER FEEL VERY RICH AND PITY MAUD FOR BEING SO POOR
DO YOU KNOW OUR BRANCH SENT IN LESS WORK THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS LAST MONTH AND MRS FITZ GEORGE SAID SHE DID N'T SEE HOW FIFTEEN YOUNG LADIES COULD MANAGE TO DO SO LITTLE WE DON'T TALK A BIT MORE THAN THE OLD LADIES DO
BUT HE NEVER TOLD WHICH BOY DID IT AND HE ONLY LIVED A WEEK
POLLY AND I ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH YET TO GET TOUGH AND COOL AND WE ARE STILL SILLY ENOUGH TO PITY UNHAPPY PEOPLE TOM SHAW ESPECIALLY ADDED BELLE UNDER HER BREATH
SO DAY AFTER DAY SHE TRUDGED THROUGH THE DULL BACK STREETS LONGING FOR THE SUNNY PARK THE FACE THAT ALWAYS BRIGHTENED WHEN IT SAW HER COMING AND MOST OF ALL THE CHANCE OF MEETING WELL IT WAS N'T TRIX
I HAVE N'T HEARD IT THIS MANY A DAY POLLY DID N'T LIKE TO SING BEFORE STRANGERS FOR SHE HAD HAD NO TEACHING BUT SUCH AS HER BUSY MOTHER COULD GIVE HER
I LOVE TO CUT AND MAUD'S FACE BRIGHTENED
WHAT IS IT
GOOD-BY OH DEAR
YES DEAR YOU VE THE GIFT OF SYMPATHY AND THE RARE ART OF SHOWING IT WITHOUT OFFENDING
MY TIME IS TO COME I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU WALKING ABOUT THE WORLD WITH YOUR BACK HAIR DOWN BEWAILING A HARD-HEARTED LOVER SAID TOM
MAY THREE CHEERS FOR BOSTON
HOPE HE LL ENJOY HIMSELF OBSERVED TOM WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH ALL THE MYSTERIES AND REACHED THAT STATE OF SUBLIME INDIFFERENCE WHICH JUNIORS SEEM TO PRIDE THEMSELVES UPON
WE CAN'T ANY OF US DO ALL WE WOULD LIKE BUT WE CAN DO OUR BEST FOR EVERY CASE THAT COMES TO US AND THAT HELPS AMAZINGLY
MEN DON'T BELONG IN KITCHENS CRIED MAUD AS HER BROTHER APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
TOMMY LIKES TO HAVE HIS LADIES A CREDIT TO HIM YOU KNOW SAID FANNY DEPARTING TO TAKE A BEAUTY SLEEP
A LITTLE OLD MAN IN NANKEEN TROUSERS AND VEST A LONG BLUE COAT AND RUFFLED SHIRT LEANING ON HIS CANE FOR HE WAS LAME AND SMILING AND BOWING LIKE A TRUE FRENCHMAN
SHE SHUNNED FANNY FOR A DAY OR TWO BUT GAINED NOTHING BY IT FOR THAT YOUNG LADY HEARING OF SYDNEY'S SUDDEN DEPARTURE COULD NOT REST TILL SHE DISCOVERED THE CAUSE OF IT AND WALKED IN UPON POLLY ONE AFTERNOON JUST WHEN THE DUSK MADE IT A PROPITIOUS HOUR FOR TENDER CONFIDENCES
HE HAD TOLD YOUR MOTHER AND FAN BEFORE YOU CAME AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE SO UNHAPPY I SUPPOSE THEY ARE SAFE ENOUGH
I READ OVER MY JOURNAL JUST NOW AND I M AFRAID IT S NOT A GOOD ONE
IT WAS ALL VERY DELIGHTFUL TILL SHE GOT HOME AND WAS ALONE
DID SHE SCOLD YOU AS USUAL SHE JUST DID WHAT WAS THE MATTER WELL I LL LEAVE IT TO YOU IF THIS IS N'T UNREASONABLE
BUT DON'T SAY A WORD TO HER FOR SHE LL NEVER FORGIVE MY TELLING IF SHE KNEW IT I DON'T CARE FOR THAT
THEN GHOSTS BEGAN TO WALK AND THE MICE SCUTTLED BACK TO THEIR HOLES IN ALARM FOR WHITE FIGURES GLIDED FROM ROOM TO ROOM TILL ALL WERE ASSEMBLED IN THE LITTLE CHAMBER
SITTING UP WE PEEPED AND LISTENED BREATHLESSLY
IF EVERY ONE WOULD FOLLOW THE DAVENPORTS EXAMPLE WORKWOMEN WOULD N'T STARVE OR SERVANTS BE SUCH A TROUBLE
POLLY FELT THAT TOM HAD PAID HER THE HIGHEST AND MOST BEAUTIFUL COMPLIMENT HE COULD HAVE DEVISED
HE FELT GRATEFUL AND IN A BURST OF CONFIDENCE OFFERED A HANDFUL OF PEANUTS FOR HIS POCKETS WERE ALWAYS SUPPLIED WITH THIS AGREEABLE DELICACY AND HE MIGHT BE TRACED ANYWHERE BY THE TRAIL OF SHELLS HE LEFT BEHIND HIM
FOR SOME OF THE LITTLE BOYS GOT TIPSY AND HAD TO BE TOOKED HOME
NELLY SEEING ME LIE WHITE AND WEAK THOUGHT I WAS DYING AND WENT OVER TO THE NEIGHBOR'S FOR AUNT BETSEY AND BURST IN UPON THE OLD LADIES SITTING PRIMLY AT THEIR TEA CRYING DISTRACTEDLY OH AUNT BETSEY COME QUICK
COULD N'T THINK WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT
ALL THE MORE FUN
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MY FAMILY SAID POLLY
AND WHEN THEY EMERGED THE FEAST WAS OVER EXCEPT FOR A FEW VORACIOUS YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHO STILL LINGERED AMONG THE RUINS
IS THE CHILD GOING TO HAVE A FEVER CRIED THE OLD LADY WHO DID NOT OBSERVE THE TELL TALE NUTS AT HER FEET
A BOWL OF BREAD AND MILK NIGHT AND MORNING WITH BAKED APPLES OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT IS ALL I WANT AND I CAN HAVE IT WHEN I LIKE IS YOUR ROOM COMFORTABLY FURNISHED
I VE BEEN TOO BUSY TO THINK OR CARE TILL NOW BUT HERE IT IS NEARLY MAY AND I HAVE HARDLY A DECENT RAG TO MY BACK
PRODUCED BY DAVID REED AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL BY LOUISA M
POLLY READ THE LANGUAGE OF THESE EYES AND ANSWERED THEIR MUTE PRAYER WITH A SIMPLE ELOQUENCE THAT SAID MORE THAN ANY WORDS FOR SHE JUST STOOPED DOWN AND KISSED THE POOR CHILD WITH HER OWN EYES FULL AND LIPS THAT TREMBLED WITH THE SYMPATHY SHE COULD NOT TELL
I M STARVED AT COTTON'S MERCY ON ME
YOU MUST COME UP AND SEE ME TO-MORROW IF YOU ARE ABLE
SO JUST KEEP QUIET AND EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT I M AFRAID IT WON'T BEGAN POLLY WHO NOT BEING USED TO SECRETS FOUND IT VERY HARD TO KEEP EVEN A SMALL ONE
BECAUSE A GOOD BEATING MAKES THEM BETTER
THE NOVELTY SOON WORE OFF AND THOUGH SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS PREPARED FOR DRUDGERY SHE FOUND IT VERY TEDIOUS TO GO ON DOING THE SAME THING DAY AFTER DAY
TRUDGING HOME TO DINNER TIRED AND DISAPPOINTED POOR POLLY RECEIVED ANOTHER BLOW WHICH HURT HER MORE THAN THE LOSS OF ALL HER PUPILS
FOR WOMEN OFTEN SEW THE TRAGEDY OR COMEDY OF LIFE INTO THEIR WORK AS THEY SIT APPARENTLY SAFE AND SERENE AT HOME YET ARE THINKING DEEPLY LIVING WHOLE HEART-HISTORIES AND PRAYING FERVENT PRAYERS WHILE THEY EMBROIDER PRETTY TRIFLES OR DO THE WEEKLY MENDING
HURRAH FOR LAFAYETTE AND MAYOR QUINCY
PEOPLE COME TO HER WITH THEIR TROUBLES AND SHE GOES TO THEM WITH ALL SORTS OF HELP FROM SOAP AND SOUP TO SHROUDS FOR THE DEAD AND COMFORT FOR THE LIVING
IT DON'T SNOW HARD AND I LL BUNDLE UP AND YOU CAN SEND FOR ME WHEN PAPA COMES I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO ANSWERED FAN WHO WAS IN A VERY BAD TEMPER
FOR IN A MINUTE SHE LAUGHED AND SAID CONTENTEDLY MY MOTHER LIKES ME TO DRESS SIMPLY AND I DON'T MIND
BESIDES IT IS N'T NINE YET AND WILL IS GOING TO TAKE ME ALONG WHEN HE GOES
DOWN RUSHED DEBBY TO FIND ME DANCING ABOUT THE KITCHEN WITH A GREAT BUMP ON MY FOREHEAD A BIG SPOON IN MY HAND AND A PAIR OF BRIGHT PURPLE FEET
BUT I DO WANT TO GO AND MAUD SWALLOWED HER TEARS AND BEGAN TO STROKE AGAIN
JOY AND SORROW LOVE AND FEAR LIFE AND DEATH BRING SO MANY OF THE SAME NEEDS TO ALL THAT THE WONDER IS WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BETTER BUT WAIT TILL TIMES OF TRIBULATION TEACH US THAT HUMAN NATURE IS VERY MUCH THE SAME IN MEN AND WOMEN
I WANT TO DO LIKE OTHER GIRLS JUST FOR ONCE AND ENJOY MYSELF WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG
AND I WAS NOT GOING TO BACK OUT AND LEAVE HER TO WEAR ANY MORE WILLOWS SO HERE WE ARE
I DO WISH WE COULD BE LEFT IN PEACE THERE CAN'T BE TOO MUCH CHARITY BURST OUT POLLY FORGETTING HER SHYNESS ALL AT ONCE
BY THE WAY SYD'S GOT BACK
DID YOU EVER THAT S BECAUSE IT CAME OUT THAT CARRIE USED TO FORGE EXCUSES IN HER MAMMA'S NAME AND GO PROMENADING WITH HER ORESTE WHEN THEY THOUGHT HER SAFE AT SCHOOL
FANNY CAME FLYING DOWN TO MEET HER DARLING POLLY AS TOM PRESENTED HER WITH THE GRACEFUL REMARK I VE GOT HER AND THE AIR OF A DAUNTLESS HUNTER PRODUCING THE TROPHIES OF HIS SKILL
WON'T IT SEEM STRANGE TO HAVE POLLY IN TOWN AND YET NOT WITH US WE LL GET HER SOMEHOW
YOU MUST COME AND SEE MY PETS MAUD FOR MY CAT AND BIRD LIVE TOGETHER AS HAPPILY AS BROTHER AND SISTER SAID POLLY TURNING TO MAUD WHO DEVOURED EVERY WORD SHE SAID
I M NOT MAD EITHER
COME AND HAVE ANOTHER TURN BEFORE THEY COULD START HOWEVER THE AWFUL SPECTACLE OF A LITTLE DOG TROTTING OUT OF THE ROOM WITH A PAPER PARCEL IN HIS MOUTH MADE POLLY CLASP HER HANDS WITH THE DESPAIRING CRY
I REALLY DON'T THINK HE CARES FOR HER HALF AS MUCH AS HE MAKES BELIEVE BUT HE LL STAND BY HER THROUGH THICK AND THIN RATHER THAN DO AS BANKS DID POOR TOM WAS ALL POLLY SAID WHEN FAN HAD POURED THE STORY INTO HER EAR AS THEY SAT WHISPERING IN THE SOFA CORNER
WHEN IS SHE COMING ASKED MRS SHAW QUITE WILLING TO HELP POLLY BUT PRIVATELY RESOLVING THAT MAUD SHOULD BE FINISHED OFF BY THE MOST FASHIONABLE MASTER IN THE CITY
WHICH DID YOU LIKE BEST ASKED FANNY WITH A LANGUID AIR OF SUPERIORITY
NOT HARD TO GUESS
I LL PUT THAT WITH THE OTHER SYMBOLS AT HER FEET
NO SIR AND TOM ROSE FROM THE SOFA WITH AN AIR OF INDIGNANT RESOLUTION THE IMPRESSIVE EFFECT OF WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT DAMAGED BY A TOUSLED HEAD AND THE HUNCHED APPEARANCE OF HIS GARMENTS GENERALLY
I GET LECTURING ENOUGH IN ANOTHER QUARTER AND CAN'T STAND ANY MORE
HERE POLLY FOUND HER PLACE AT ONCE FOR IN THIS LITTLE WORLD LOVE AND LIBERTY PREVAILED
IF WISHING WOULD DO ANY GOOD I SHOULD WISH EM IN MY LAP AT ONCE ADDED NELLY
THERE S A FIRE IN THE KITCHEN DEBBY ALWAYS LEAVES THE KETTLE ON AND WE CAN USE HER SAUCEPAN AND I KNOW WHERE THE SUGAR IS AND WE LL HAVE A GRAND TIME IN WE WENT AND FELL TO WORK VERY QUIETLY
WHEN HE CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS GREETED WITH A GENERAL HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM AND AT HIS PLACE LAY GIFTS FROM EVERY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
I DROPPED THE SAUCEPAN AND DID N'T RUN FOR A PART OF THE HOT JUICE SPLASHED UPON MY BARE FEET AND ANKLES AND MADE ME SCREAM WITH DREADFUL PAIN
I HOPE I MAY
I VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT MY DEAR BOY ALL THE EVENING FOR TOM REMINDS ME OF HIM SHE ADDED WITH A SIGH
FEELING HER CONFIDENCE MUCH SHAKEN IN THE YOUTH POLLY PRIVATELY RESOLVED TO LET HIM ALONE AND CHANGED THE CONVERSATION BY SAYING AS SHE LOOKED ADMIRINGLY ABOUT THE LARGE HANDSOME ROOM HOW SPLENDID IT IS
WILL CONSIDERED HIS SISTER THE BEST AND PRETTIEST GIRL GOING AND POLLY KNOWING WELL THAT A TIME WOULD COME WHEN HE WOULD FIND A BETTER AND A PRETTIER WAS GRATEFUL FOR HIS GOOD OPINION AND TRIED TO DESERVE IT
JUST GIVE MAUD A BIT SHE S SO DISAPPOINTED
A FEW SUCH PATRONS DID MUCH FOR POLLY AND THE MUSIC SHE GAVE THEM HAD AN UNDERTONE OF GRATITUDE THAT LEFT BLITHE ECHOES IN THOSE GREAT HOUSES WHICH MONEY COULD NOT BUY
THE OLD LIFE WAS TOO HARD FOR SUCH A LITTLE THING AS YOU AND WE ARE GOING TO TRY AND MAKE THE NEW ONE EVER SO MUCH EASIER AND HAPPIER SAID POLLY FORGETTING EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT THIS WAS A GIRL LIKE HERSELF WHO NEEDED HEARTENING UP
MARIA IS A SENSIBLE PRETTY GIRL AND NED WILL BE A HAPPY OLD FELLOW WHY DID YOU LET US THINK IT WAS YOU I ONLY TEASED FAN A LITTLE
AH I KNEW YOU D BACK OUT AND TOM WALKED AWAY WITH AN AIR OF SCORN THAT CUT POLLY TO THE HEART
IT S VERY SILLY BUT IT HURTS ME TO BE CUT BY MY OLD FRIENDS
I VE BEEN DYING TO GO ALL DAY TRIED TO GET TICKETS THIS MORNING AND COULD N'T BEEN FUMING ABOUT IT EVER SINCE AND NOW OH HOW SPLENDID AND POLLY COULD NOT RESTRAIN AN ECSTATIC SKIP FOR THIS BURST OF JOY RATHER UPSET HER
I M POLLY AT HOME AND I M FOND OF BEING CALLED SO
YES IT WAS VERY PRETTY AND BECOMING I REMEMBER BUT ITS DAY IS OVER FANNY LET THE DRESS LIE IN HER LAP A MINUTE AS SHE ABSENTLY PICKED AT THE FRINGE SMILING TO HERSELF OVER THE HAPPY TIME WHEN SHE WORE IT LAST AND SYDNEY SAID SHE ONLY NEEDED COWSLIPS IN HER LAP TO LOOK LIKE SPRING
DO GO AND FINISH
EMMA IS THE PLAINEST DRESSED GIRL IN THE ROOM NEXT TO ME YET ANY ONE CAN SEE SHE IS A TRUE GENTLEWOMAN SAID POLLY WARMLY
THEN THEY BOTH BURST OUT LAUGHING AND POLLY FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE JOKE JOINED THEM SAYING HERE ARE SOME PEANUTS TOM
THESE THINGS HURT POLLY MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS FOR AT HOME EVERY ONE WORKED AND EVERY ONE WAS RESPECTED FOR IT
AN EASY-CHAIR NOW OR A LITTLE COUCH SO NECESSARY WHEN ONE COMES IN TIRED SAID MRS SHAW TAKING UNUSUAL INTEREST IN THE AFFAIR
AUNT'S WAS LINED WITH RED SILK VELVET AND WHEN THE COACH WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HER AT THE GOVERNOR'S DEATH SHE JUST RIPPED OUT THE LINING AND WE GIRLS HAD SPENCERS MADE OF IT
THERE WAS A PAUSE AFTER THIS LITTLE PASSAGE-AT-ARMS BUT FAN WANTED TO BE AMUSED FOR TIME HUNG HEAVILY ON HER HANDS SO SHE ASKED IN A MORE AMIABLE TONE HOW S TRIX AS SWEET AS EVER ANSWERED TOM GRUFFLY
WHAT DO YOU SAY GIVE HER A SCEPTRE
LET US HAVE COFFEE TO FINISH OFF WITH
YOU COOK ANOTHER KETTLEFUL AND I LL PICK YOU SOME MEATS ALL FAIR
WE WILL SAID POLLY AND MOUNTING A CHAIR SHE PUT UP BID IN AND KNOCKED DOWN FAN'S ENTIRE WARDROBE TO AN IMAGINARY GROUP OF FRIENDS WITH SUCH DROLL IMITATIONS OF EACH ONE THAT THE ROOM RANG WITH LAUGHTER
YOU CAN LEARN
AND THE NEXT MINUTE BOTH WERE LAUGHING AT A DROLL SKETCH OF TOM IN THE GUTTER WITH THE BIG DOG HOWLING OVER HIM AND THE VELOCIPEDE RUNNING AWAY
SIX YEARS AFTERWARD WHAT DO YOU THINK POLLY IS GOING TO DO THIS WINTER EXCLAIMED FANNY LOOKING UP FROM THE LETTER SHE HAD BEEN EAGERLY READING
SO HAVE I
FOR SHE TOLD HER FATHER A LIE AND WON'T FORGIVE ME FOR NOT DOING SO TOO
HOW HE LIKED HIS BUSINESS AND WANTED WILL TO COME AND TAKE SOME PLACE NEAR HIM
ONE SNOWY SUNDAY AFTERNOON TOM LAY ON THE SOFA IN HIS FAVORITE ATTITUDE READING PENDENNIS FOR THE FOURTH TIME AND SMOKING LIKE A CHIMNEY AS HE DID SO
I WISH YOU D GET A COLOR LIKE THIS FANNY SAID MR SHAW AS POLLY CAME INTO THE DINING-ROOM AFTER SMOOTHING HER HAIR
TOM WAS SITTING IN HIS FAVORITE ATTITUDE ASTRIDE OF A CHAIR WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED AND HIS CHIN ON THE TOP RAIL
I DON'T CARE THOUGH
I D ASK YOU IN A MINUTE IF I WAS IN TROUBLE SAID POLLY IN HER CONFIDING WAY
AUNT KEPT IT FULL OF PRETTY PATCHWORK OR WHAT I LIKED BETTER GINGER-NUTS AND PEPPERMINT DROPS TO AMUSE ME THOUGH SHE DID N'T APPROVE OF COSSETING CHILDREN UP ANY MORE THAN I DO NOW I LIKE THAT VEWY WELL AND I WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN THERE WAS MAUD'S CONDESCENDING REMARK AS SHE PUT BACK THE LITTLE BAG AFTER A CAREFUL PEEP INSIDE AS IF SHE HOPED TO FIND AN ANCIENT GINGER-NUT OR A WELL-PRESERVED PEPPERMINT DROP STILL LINGERING IN SOME CORNER
PROVOKING BOY
IT WAS NOT AT ALL THE THING FOR HER TO DO
WHAT CAN THE GIRL EXPECT CAN'T SAY BUT I DON'T FANCY THE MATCH MYSELF DON'T BE A DOG IN THE MANGER TOM
IT S A NEW THING AND MUST BE A LITTLE BIT HARD AT FIRST STAMMERED FANNY NOT LIKING TO SAY THAT WORKING FOR ONE'S LIVING SEEMED A DREADFUL HARDSHIP TO HER
SHE SNAPPED HIM UP AT ONCE AND THERE HE IS IN A NICE SCRAPE
FOR TO THOSE WHO HAVE ENACTED THEM THE MOST ELABORATE DESCRIPTION SEEMS TAME AND TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT THE SIMPLEST PICTURE SEEMS OVERDONE
THAT MADE BELLE FIRE UP AND SAY IT WAS A MEAN THING TO DO WITHOUT OFFERING SOME RETURN FOR A COSTLY THING LIKE THAT
THERE S PLENTY IN THE STORE-ROOM
BUT BEFORE HE COULD CATCH ANY ELIGIBLE PARTNER POLLY WAS PROVIDED WITH THE BEST DANCER IN THE ROOM
EVERY ONE ECHOED THE EXCLAMATION NEXT DAY
WE GIRLS HAD DRESSED THE HOUSE WITH FLOWERS
I CAN'T SING ANY MORE
AS TWO STICKS
HE FELT THAT ONE PERSON APPRECIATED HIM
AND NO SOONER WAS TOM ON HIS LEGS AGAIN WHEN THE WHOLE PARTY WENT ASTRAY AND MUCH TRIBULATION WAS THE CONSEQUENCE
FOR HER INNOCENT NATURE REBELLED AGAINST THE SPECTACLE WHICH AS YET GAVE HER MORE PAIN THAN PLEASURE
FOR THE LOVING HEART THAT HAD ALWAYS SEEN BELIEVED AND TRIED TO STRENGTHEN ALL GOOD IMPULSES IN TOM WAS WELL REPAID FOR ITS INSTINCTIVE TRUST BY THE HAPPINESS OF THE YEARS TO COME
I VE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP HIM ALL NIGHT
OH MY BONNET WHERE
POLLY FOLLOWED CONSUMED WITH ANXIETY AND MAUD LAUGHED TILL MRS SHAW SENT DOWN TO KNOW WHO WAS IN HYSTERICS
AS MUCH A MYSTERY TO YOU AS IT IS TO US HOW YOU GIRLS CAN LIKE TO GABBLE AND PRINK FROM ONE WEEK'S END TO THE OTHER RETORTED TOM
POOR DEAR I WISH I D KNOWN IT SOONER THOUGHT POLLY AS SHE TRIED TO SOOTHE HER WITH COMFORTABLE PATS SNIFFS OF COLOGNE AND SYMPATHIZING REMARKS UPON THE SUBJECT OF HEADACHE CAREFULLY IGNORING THAT OTHER FEMININE AFFLICTION THE HEARTACHE
HOW IS FAN ASKED POLLY WITH TACT
I LL LEARN IT ADDED SHAW JR WITH AN EMPHATIC GESTURE WHICH BURST THE LAST BUTTON OFF HIS GLOVES
OF COURSE NEITHER COULD HELP LAUGHING AT THAT
FALSE PRIDE I DARE SAY BUT IT S THE TRUTH AND THERE S NO USE IN DODGING NOT A BIT AND I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT S COMFORTABLE
I D LIKE TO
NOW DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD I CAN'T BEAR IT AND POLLY DREW HERSELF AWAY AS SHE SPOKE IN A DESPERATE SORT OF TONE
HOW THE GIRLS MADE IT UP NO ONE EVER KNEW
THE WISE OLD LADY SAW THAT POLLY HAD REACHED THAT POINT WHERE THE GIRL SUDDENLY BLOOMS INTO A WOMAN ASKING SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN PLEASURE TO SATISFY THE NEW ASPIRATIONS THAT ARE BORN
WHAT WOULD YOUR BLESSED MOTHER SAY TO HEAR SUCH EXPRESSIONS FROM YOU
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO DO ASKED POLLY FOLLOWING HER INTO THE HALL
I MISS HER BUT KNOW SHE LL GET TIRED OF BEING GOODY AND WILL COME BACK TO ME BEFORE LONG DON'T BE TOO SURE OF THAT MA'AM SOMETHING IN TOM'S TONE MADE FAN TURN ROUND AND ASK WHAT DO YOU MEAN WELL IT STRIKES ME THAT SYDNEY IS ONE OF POLLY'S NEW FRIENDS
BUT HIS FACE BRIGHTENED FOR POLLY'S INTEREST SOOTHED HIS INJURED FEELINGS AND HE WAS GLAD TO PROVE HIS ELOCUTIONARY POWERS
SHE LOVED DANCING AND ENTERED INTO THE GAYETY OF THE SCENE WITH A HEARTINESS THAT WAS PLEASANT TO SEE
TELL THOSE GIRLS ABOUT HER AND IF I M NOT MUCH MISTAKEN YOU WILL FIND THEM READY TO HELP FOR HALF THE TIME IT IS N'T HARDNESS OF HEART BUT IGNORANCE OR THOUGHTLESSNESS ON THE PART OF THE RICH THAT MAKES THEM SEEM SO CARELESS OF THE POOR TO TELL THE TRUTH I M AFRAID OF BEING LAUGHED AT IF I TRY TO TALK SERIOUSLY ABOUT SUCH THINGS TO THE GIRLS SAID POLLY FRANKLY
THEN GOT UP LOOKING AS PALE AND RESOLUTE AS IF GOING TO MEET SOME DREADFUL DOOM AND PUTTING ON HER THINGS WENT AWAY TO POLLY'S AS FAST AS HER DIGNITY WOULD ALLOW
THE FLOWERS ARE ALL RIGHT
THANK YOU BUT I DON'T NEED ANYTHING FOR I BROUGHT ALL SORTS OF HOME COMFORTS WITH ME
TOM LAUGHED AT POLLY'S EARNEST WAY OF TALKING WHEN SHE WAS INTERESTED IN ANYTHING
I GO WITH HER SOMETIMES AND IT IS MORE EXCITING THAN ANY PLAY TO SEE AND HEAR THE LIVES AND STORIES OF THE POOR HOW CAN YOU BEAR THE DREADFUL SIGHTS AND SOUNDS THE BAD AIR AND THE POVERTY THAT CAN'T BE CURED BUT IT IS N'T ALL DREADFUL
GLAD OF THAT
I AM AFRAID THAT MAUD'S LESSON WAS NOT AS THOROUGH AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOR POLLY'S HEAD WAS SUCH A CHAOS OF BONNETS GLOVES OPERA-CLOAKS AND FANS THAT MAUD BLUNDERED THROUGH MURDERING TIME AND TUNE AT HER OWN SWEET WILL
AND IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM HE LL TORMENT YOU TO DEATH
WHAT S THE MATTER
SHE WAS EVEN MORE OLD-FASHIONED THAN POLLY
I WISH YOU COULD BE WITH NED
THE OLD-FASHIONED GIRL IS NOT INTENDED AS A PERFECT MODEL BUT AS A POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT UPON PAGE THE GIRL OF THE PERIOD WHO SEEMS SORROWFULLY IGNORANT OR ASHAMED OF THE GOOD OLD FASHIONS WHICH MAKE WOMAN TRULY BEAUTIFUL AND HONORED AND THROUGH HER RENDER HOME WHAT IT SHOULD BE,-A HAPPY PLACE WHERE PARENTS AND CHILDREN BROTHERS AND SISTERS LEARN TO LOVE AND KNOW AND HELP ONE ANOTHER
BUT AS TOM SAYS IT DON'T MUCH MATTER AND FANNY GAVE AN EFFECTIVE TOUCH TO THE BLUE BOW ABOVE POLLY'S LEFT TEMPLE
AS IF I WAS N'T ANYBODY HAD N'T ANY FEELINGS AND WAS ONLY MADE TO AMUSE OR WORK FOR PEOPLE
SO SHE MADE HER ROOM AND HERSELF AS NEAT AND INVITING AS POSSIBLE AND ALWAYS RAN TO MEET HIM WITH A BRIGHT FACE AND A MOTHERLY GREETING WHEN HE CAME TRAMPING IN RUDDY BRISK AND BEAMING WITH THE BROWN LOAF AND THE LITTLE POT OF BEANS FROM THE BAKE-HOUSE NEAR BY
BUT POLLY HAD AND OFTEN FELT LIKE A LITTLE WOOD-BIRD SHUT UP IN A GILDED CAGE
TOO MUCH PLEASURE WOULD SOON SPOIL ME ANSWERED POLLY SHAKING HER HEAD
POOR LITTLE SOUL
THAT SONG ALWAYS MAKES ME CRY AND FEEL AS IF I HAD NO RIGHT TO BE SO COMFORTABLE SAID BELLE OPENLY WIPING HER EYES ON A CRASH TOWEL
I KNEW YOU GIRLS WERE A SET OF HUMBUGS AND VERY PRETTY ONES TOO SOME OF YOU BUT I CAN'T SAY I LIKE TO SEE YOU PAINTED UP LIKE A LOT OF ACTRESSES SAID TOM WITH AN AIR OF DISGUST
ANY MORE PORTRAITS IN YOUR GALLERY ASKED SYDNEY AS IF HE LIKED TO SHARE ALL THE NONSENSE GOING
BUT SHE IS N'T KIND TO ME
I LL COME EVERY EVENING THEN
WE COULD N'T DECIDE WHAT TO PUT IN THE HANDS AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE SYMBOL
POLLY'S EYE WENT FROM ONE LITTLE FIGURE TO THE OTHER AND SHE THOUGHT THAT FANNY LOOKED THE ODDEST OF THE TWO
BUT IT MUST BE FUN
NO I AM ADMIRING MISS POLLY'S FINE MANNERS HE ANSWERED IN A GRAVE RESPECTFUL TONE WHICH HAD IMPRESSED FANNY VERY MUCH FOR MR SYDNEY WAS CONSIDERED BY ALL THE GIRLS AS A MODEL OF GOOD BREEDING AND THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH THEY CALLED ELEGANCE FANNY WISHED SHE HAD DONE THAT LITTLE THING AND WON THAT APPROVING LOOK FOR SHE VALUED THE YOUNG MAN'S GOOD OPINION BECAUSE IT WAS SO HARD TO WIN BY HER SET AT LEAST
SHE ALWAYS DOES SO THAT SHE MAY BE FREE FOR THE SUMMER CAMPAIGN
SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO LOCK THE TRUNK AND WHEN MAUD RAISED THE LID TO BEGIN HER VOYAGE SEVERAL OBJECTS OF INTEREST MET HER EYES
HOW POLLIE WOULD LOOK SPELT SO WELL NEVER MIND
I HAVE N'T READ ONE BUT IT S EVIDENT YOU HAVE YOUNG MAN AND YOU D BETTER STOP I DON'T CARE FOR EM
SITTING ON THE BEDSIDE POLLY LISTENED WHILE JANE TOLD THE STORY WHICH WAS SO NEW TO HER LISTENER THAT EVERY WORD SANK DEEP INTO HER HEART AND NEVER WAS FORGOTTEN
SHAW JR BEING HIGHLY INCENSED AT THE DISRESPECTFUL MANNER IN WHICH HIS ENGAGEMENT WAS TREATED TRIED TO ASSUME A SUPERB AIR OF INDIFFERENCE AND FINDING THAT A DECIDED FAILURE WAS ABOUT TO STROLL OUT OF THE ROOM WITH A COMPREHENSIVE NOD WHEN HIS MOTHER CALLED AFTER HIM
I WISH YOU WOULD
BUT I D LIKE A LITTLE ALL THE SAME FOR IT IS SO COMFORTABLE TO BUY NICE THINGS
EVERY CROSS WORD I EVER SAID TO JIMMY COMES BACK NOW AND MAKES ME WISH I HAD N'T TWO GREAT TEARS ROLLED DOWN POLLY'S CHEEKS AND WERE QUIETLY WIPED AWAY
TRIX HAS THE FLOOR IF THEY SPENT THEIR WAGES PROPERLY I SHOULD N'T MIND SO MUCH BUT THEY THINK THEY MUST BE AS FINE AS ANYBODY AND DRESS SO WELL THAT IT IS HARD TO TELL MISTRESS FROM MAID
I VE WORN TURNED AND DYED GOWNS ALL MY DAYS AND IT DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ALIENATED MY FRIENDS OR INJURED MY CONSTITUTION THAT IT HAS N'T
IT WAS HORRID FOR HE LOOKED AS IF TAKEN BY A FLASH OF LIGHTNING SO BLACK WILD AND STARING WAS IT
BUT I LL BE QUIET AND NOT DO ANY HARM WHY WON'T YOU ASKED TOM CURIOUSLY
I DID N'T MEAN TO SHOW THAT ONE
DON'T YOU LAUGH AT POLLY'S THINGS
AS NONE OF THEM SEEMED LOOKING FOR ANY ONE HE DID NOT ACCOST THEM BUT EYED EACH NEW BATCH WITH THE AIR OF A MARTYR
I KNOW A HOUSE SAID POLLY SEWING BUSILY AS SHE TALKED WHERE EVERY SERVANT WHO ENTERS IT BECOMES AN OBJECT OF INTEREST TO THE MISTRESS AND HER DAUGHTERS
MAYBE SHE S GONE DOWN TO THE OFFICE TO TELL PA
ON A STOOL AT THE OLD LADY'S FEET SAT POLLY LOOKING UP WITH INTENT FACE AND EAGER EYES QUITE ABSORBED IN THE HISTORY OF A HIGH-HEELED BROCADE SHOE WHICH LAY IN HER LAP
WE LL TURN THE GRAY AND I LL WEAR IT BRAVELY THEN IT WILL BE MORE BECOMING THAN EVER
FOR THERE S FAN CRYING HER EYES OUT UPSTAIRS AND HERE ARE YOU STOWED AWAY IN A DARK CLOSET AS DUMB AS A FISH AND NOBODY BUT ME TO BRING YOU BOTH ROUND
BUT PRIDE AND THE RESOLUTION TO STAND BY FATHER KEPT UP HER COURAGE AND SHE WORKED AWAY WITH FEVERISH ACTIVITY AT WHATEVER TASK CAME FIRST TILL JUST AS STRENGTH AND HEART WERE ABOUT TO FAIL ORDER BEGAN TO EMERGE FROM CHAOS AND THE VISION OF A HOME MADE HAPPY AND COMFORTABLE BY HER SKILL AND CARE CAME TO REPAY AND SUSTAIN HER
HE LOOKS OLDER BUT THAT S THE BEARD AND THE ROUGH COAT I SUPPOSE
PEOPLE IN LOVE ALWAYS DO SUCH STUPID THINGS SO THEY DO
WILL'S MINISTERIAL DREAM CAME TO PASS IN THE COURSE OF TIME HOWEVER AND A GENTLE BRIGHT-EYED LADY RULED OVER THE PARSONAGE WHOM THE REVEREND WILLIAM CALLED HIS LITTLE JANE FARTHER INTO FUTURITY EVEN THIS RASH PEN DARES NOT PROCEED BUT PAUSES HERE CONCLUDING IN THE WORDS OF THE DEAR OLD FAIRY TALES AND SO THEY WERE MARRIED AND ALL LIVED HAPPILY TILL THEY DIED END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL BY LOUISA MAY ALCOTT
ONE DREADFUL MINUTE AS THEY CAME PARALLEL AND NO ONE SPOKE OR BOWED THEN IT WAS ALL OVER AND POLLY WENT ON FEELING AS IF SOME ONE HAD SLAPPED HER IN THE FACE
DO YOU SUPPOSE PEOPLE WILL KNOW IT SAID FAN DOUBTFULLY
IF THEY CAN SPARE ME FROM HOME I D LOVE TO COME DEARLY THEY MUST LEND YOU FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE YOU DO US ALL GOOD AND WE NEED YOU DO I
THE GIRLS SEEMED IN GREAT SPIRITS PARTICULARLY AFTER THEY WERE JOINED BY A SHORT GENTLEMAN WITH SUCH A YOUNG FACE THAT POLLY WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM A BOY IF HE HAD NOT WORN A TALL BEAVER
YOU LOOK TIRED OUT POLLY OH NO
SO IN SPITE OF HER BRAVE RESOLUTIONS POLLY DID LONG FOR A LITTLE FUN SOMETIMES AND AFTER SAYING VIRTUOUSLY TO HERSELF AT NINE
NEEDLES AND TONGUES CHAPTER 12
I M GOING TO STAY AND HELP
LA CHILD
BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER THEY DISCUSSED LAWSUITS OR LOVE MORTGAGES OR MOTHERS THE FEELING WAS ALL RIGHT AND THEY KNEW IT SO MR SHAW WALKED STRAIGHTER THAN USUAL AND TOM FELT THAT HE WAS IN HIS PROPER PLACE AGAIN
SO WHEN EVERY ONE EXERTED THEMSELVES TO MAKE IT A HAPPY DAY FOR HIM HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT MEANS TO BE NEARLY KILLED WITH KINDNESS AND STERNLY RESOLVED TO BE AN HONOR TO HIS FAMILY OR PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT
YES BY THE POWERS I WILL AND TOM DREW ON HIS GLOVES WITH THE AIR OF A MAN ABOUT TO MEET AND CONQUER AN ENEMY
HI THERE
HOW VERY QUEER TO LIVE SO CRIED FANNY
AND I WAS SO RELIEVED BECAUSE I HAD A KIND OF A FEELING THAT IT WAS TOM HIMSELF YOU AND WILL LAUGHED SO ABOUT IT MAUD HAD A QUEER WAY OF GOING ON WITH HER OWN THOUGHTS AND SUDDENLY COMING OUT WITH WHATEVER LAY UPPERMOST REGARDLESS OF TIME PLACE OR COMPANY
ONE OTHER PERSON ENJOYED THE HUMBLE PLEASURES OF THESE SUNDAYS QUITE AS MUCH AS POLLY AND WILL
POLLY HAD EXPECTED TO BE VERY HAPPY IN GETTING READY FOR THE PARTY
YOU SHALL TRY AND MAKE ME LIKE ALGEBRA AND I LL TRY AND MAKE YOU LIKE LATIN WILL YOU OH I D LIKE IT WELL ENOUGH IF THERE WAS ANY ONE EXPLAIN IT TO ME
THE HOUR WAS SOON OVER
BUT THE BIG ONES MUST N'T BE THOUGHT OF THANK YOU IT WAS CHARMING TO SEE THE RESOLUTION OF POLLY'S FACE WHEN SHE SAID THAT
FAN HAS BEEN A YOUNG LADY THIS TWO YEARS AND MAUD IS A SPOILED BABY
I WISH YOU D GO OFTENER
BROTHERS AND SISTERS CHAPTER 11
AND THE PARTY IS FOR POLLY SO I MUST HAVE SOME YOUNG FOLKS ON HER ACCOUNT SAID FANNY WHEN SENDING OUT HER INVITATIONS
A LOOK OF MINGLED PAIN AND PATIENCE AS IF SOME LOSS HAD COME TO HER AND LEFT THE BITTERNESS OF REGRET BEHIND
BUT SHE HAD GONE TO GRANDMA'S ROOM FOR THOUGH THE OLD LADY WAS OUT IT SEEMED A REFUGE
I LL KILL HER FIRST TOO LATE LET ME TELL YOU IS THAT DOOR SHUT AND MAUD SAFE FANNY RECONNOITERED AND RETURNING LISTENED BREATHLESSLY WHILE POLLY POURED INTO HER EAR THE BITTER SECRET WHICH WAS PREYING ON HER SOUL
LIFE MY BRETHREN IS LIKE PLUM-CAKE BEGAN POLLY IMPRESSIVELY FOLDING HER FLOURY HANDS
WHY WHAT ELSE COULD I DO ASKED POLLY MUCH DISTURBED
THE SIGHT OF WILL AND POLLY'S SIMPLE AFFECTION FOR ONE ANOTHER REMINDED HIM OF A NEGLECTED DUTY SO PLEASANTLY THAT HE COULD NOT FORGET IT
THE SMART ONE FOR FAN THE SWEET ONE FOR POLLY AND THE GAY ONE FOR PUG
BACK I HURRIED WITH THE GOOD NEWS
HE TOOK HER DEATH SADLY TO HEART FOR THOUGH HE DID N'T SAY MUCH HE WAS VERY GRAVE AND STEADY FOR A LONG TIME
MISS BURTON WANTS HER AS A FRIEND ASKS NOTHING OF HER BUT HER COMPANY AND ANNA WILL GO THROUGH FIRE AND WATER FOR HER OF COURSE
HE IS A TORMENT SOMETIMES BUT I M RATHER FOND OF HIM IN SPITE OF IT
ONE NEVER KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN AND IT DOES NO HARM FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO LEARN TO BE INDEPENDENT IF SHE IS AS PRETTY AS SHE WAS LAST TIME I SAW HER SHE LL GET PUPILS FAST ENOUGH
WE ARE A BAND OF ROBBERS IN OUR CAVE AND I M THE CAPTAIN
WORKING AND HOPING FOR A CHANCE AND NEVER GETTING IT TILL ALL OF A SUDDEN MISS BURTON IS INSPIRED TO INVITE THE GIRL TO GO WITH HER FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO ITALY
THE DRESS-PARADE IS OVER AND I M EVER SO MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU POLLY FOR HELPING ME THROUGH AND SHOWING ME HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS
BUT WE COULD N'T STAY MAD AND ALWAYS MADE IT UP AGAIN AS SOON AS WE COULD
DRIVE ON GRANDMA AND TELL ONE ABOUT BOYS BROKE IN A NEW VOICE AND THERE WAS TOM ASTRIDE OF A CHAIR LISTENING AND LAUGHING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT FOR HIS BOOK HAD COME TO AN END AND HE HAD JOINED THE PARTY UNOBSERVED
AND SOME WHO TRIED TO CONQUER INDEPENDENCE ARMED ONLY WITH A NEEDLE LIKE POOR JANE
IF THEY ASK ME I SHALL TELL OF COURSE
BUT AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS SOMETHING WAS SUGGESTED BY THE SIGHT BEFORE HIM
DOWN CAME POLLY WITH HEIGHTENED COLOR BRIGHT EYES AND NOT A SINGLE EGG
SHE DOES N'T NEED A HOME THANK YOU
BUT I HOPE I DON'T LOOK VERY BAD GRANDMA READ THE LOOK IN A MINUTE
WE CAN'T DO MUCH PERHAPS JUST YET
MAMMA IS RESOLVED THAT I SHALL DO HER CREDIT AND WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST TWO WEEKS DRIVING ABOUT FROM MILLINERS TO MANTUA-MAKERS FROM MERCHANTS TO JEWELLERS
THAT SHE WOULD MAKE A CAPITAL WIFE FOR SOMEBODY AND PERHAPS IT WAS ABOUT TIME TO THINK OF SETTLING AS HIS SISTER OFTEN SAID
IS THE MAN TIPSY
DO ENJOY YOURSELF WHILE YOU CAN NOW I CALL THAT A DELICATE COMPLIMENT AND TOM WHO HAD NOT LOST HIS EARLY RELISH FOR THIS SORT OF REFRESHMENT THOUGH HE SELDOM INDULGED HIS PASSION NOWADAYS BECAUSE PEANUTS ARE CONSIDERED VULGAR FELL TO CRACKING AND MUNCHING WITH GREAT SATISFACTION
BELLE AND TRIX BOTH TRIED TO CATCH HIM AND THE SLYEST GOT HIM
WE RISE SO LATE IN THE MORNING SELDOM BEFORE SIX O'CLOCK AND SIT UP SO LATE AT NIGHT BEING SCARCELY IN BED BEFORE TEN THAT I AM QUITE SICK OF IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT LOUNGE AND GOSSIP READ NOVELS PARADE THE STREETS AND DRESS
IT S HARD TO TELL SOMETIMES
I LL LEAVE THE DOORS OPEN AND PLAY YOU A LULLABY THAT YOU CAN'T RESIST
I DECLARE IT REALLY WAS ABSURD
BUT THE ENTHUSIASM WAS SINCERE WHILE IT LASTED AND DID THEM GOOD
HAND THEM OUT TOM AND MR SHAW NODDED TOWARD AN INTERESTING LOOKING BOX THAT STOOD ON THE TABLE
LOTS OF THINGS
SERVES ME RIGHT SAID POLLY WITH A GROAN
WE OFTEN GO TO TWO OR THREE PARTIES IN AN EVENING AND SELDOM GET HOME TILL MORNING SO OF COURSE WE DON'T RISE TILL NOON NEXT DAY
MAUD HAD HER TINY CARD-CASE AND PAID CALLS LIKE MAMMA AND FAN
SHE TOOK TO HER BED AT ONCE RECEIVED HER FRIENDS IN TEARS AND A POINT-LACE CAP AND CHEERED HER FAMILY BY PLAINTIVELY INQUIRING WHEN SHE WAS TO BE TAKEN TO THE ALMSHOUSE
IT ALWAYS SEEMS AS IF SHE MUST BE UP IN HER ROOMS AND I CAN'T GET USED TO FINDING THEM EMPTY ADDED POLLY SOFTLY
OLD MR BIRD SAT ON ONE SIDE FANNY ON THE OTHER AND BOTH LET HER ALONE FOR WHICH SHE WAS VERY GRATEFUL AS HER WHOLE ATTENTION WAS SO ABSORBED IN THE SCENE AROUND HER THAT SHE COULD N'T TALK
MR SHAW DID N'T EXPECT TO SEE POLLY FOR HE HAD LEFT HER VERY BUSY AND NOW A LIGHT SNOW WAS FALLING
MAUD FELT THAT HER CONVERSATION WAS NOT AS INTERESTING AS SHE HOPED AND TRIED AGAIN
I WOULD N'T HAVE A BROTHER LIKE TOM
THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM IN MY HOUSE FOR BECKY AND SHE LETS ME DO AS SHE WOULD IF SHE WAS IN MY PLACE ANSWERED BESS WITH A LOOK WHICH HER FRIEND ANSWERED BY A SMILE
POLLY S SO PRETTY IT DON'T MATTER WHAT SHE WEARS OBSERVED TOM SURVEYING HER OVER HIS COLLAR WITH AN AIR OF CALM APPROVAL
CHAPTER XI
YES AND WE ALL LEARNED TO MAKE BREAD AND COOK AND WORE LITTLE CHINTZ GOWNS AND WERE AS GAY AND HEARTY AS KITTENS
IT S WILL COME FOR ME
IT IS ONLY BEGINNING AGAIN HE SAYS
AND SHE CAN WITE AND DWAR EVER SO MUCH BETTER THAN TOM CRIED MAUD
YOU VE BEEN READING FRENCH NOVELS I KNOW YOU HAVE
HE S SUCH A PROUD FELLOW HE WON'T LET ME ANSWERED TOM
BREAKERS AHEAD CHAPTER 16
AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS FOND OF YOU AS HE IS OF ME FONDER IF ANYTHING BECAUSE HE THINKS YOU ARE PERFECT
WELL MA'AM MY PLAN IS THIS BEGAN POLLY IMITATING MRS O'GRADY'S IMPORTANT TONE AND BAD GRAMMAR
BUT THEN IF YOUR FATHER DON'T LIKE YOU TO DO SO OUGHT YOU TO GO I TELL MAMMA AND SHE DON'T CARE
IT SOUNDS VERY NICE BUT IT CAN'T BE DONE FAN FOR I VE COME TO WORK NOT PLAY
SUCH A CUNNING TEAKETTLE AND SAUCEPAN AND A TETE-A-TETE SET AND LOTS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT
BUT I HEARD POLLY AND FAN TALKING ABOUT SOME ONE DREADFUL MYSTERIOUS AND WHEN I ASKED WHO IT WAS FAN SAID,'SIR PHILIP HO
THE PLUMS WERE LYING ALL OVER THE HEARTH THE SAUCEPAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM THE BASIN WAS BROKEN AND THE SUGAR SWIMMING ABOUT AS IF THE BOWL HAD TURNED ITSELF OVER TRYING TO SWEETEN OUR MESS FOR US
IF ANY OF YOU BOYS HONESTLY WANT TO LEARN AND WILL BEHAVE YOURSELVES I LL TAKE YOU
MERCY NO
WHY DON'T YOU ASKED MAUD BEGINNING ON HER THIRD BONNET
A LITTLE POVERTY WOULD DO YOU GOOD FAN
BUT POLLY COULD N'T BE FOUND
IF TOM COULD GET OUT I SHOULD THINK HE D CARRIED IT OFF
NOT SO DREADFUL AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT A BITTER SAD THING TO SEE THAT CHILD ONLY SEVENTEEN LYING THERE IN HER LITTLE CLEAN OLD NIGHT-GOWN WAITING FOR DEATH TO COME AND TAKE HER BECAUSE THERE DID N'T SEEM TO BE ANY ROOM FOR HER IN THE WORLD AH WELL WE SAVED HER FOR IT WAS N'T TOO LATE THANK HEAVEN AND THE FIRST THING SHE SAID WAS OH WHY DID YOU BRING ME BACK I VE BEEN NURSING HER ALL DAY HEARING HER STORY AND TRYING TO SHOW HER THAT THERE IS ROOM AND A WELCOME FOR HER
I JUST WANTED TO SAY IF YOU LL COME OUT TO-MORROW SOME TIME WE LL HAVE A GOOD COAST NO SAID POLLY I CAN'T COME WHY NOT
ONE TINY CREATURE IN BLUE PLUSH WAS CASTING DESPAIRING GLANCES AFTER A VERY SMALL LORD OF CREATION WHO WAS WALKING AWAY WITH A TODDLING BELLE IN WHITE WHILE A SECOND YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN GORGEOUS PURPLE GAITERS WAS ENDEAVORING TO CONSOLE THE DESERTED DAMSEL
YOU MAY HAVE ANOTHER GO AT IT ANY TIME YOU LIKE GENEROUSLY REMARKED TOM AS HE SHIED THE ALGEBRA AFTER THE LATIN READER
IT WAS A HANDSOME THING TO DO
THIS IS WHAT POOR MAUD TROUBLED ABOUT
SHE DON'T PREACH CRIED POLLY FIRING UP LIKE A FLASH
NO GIRL THAT EVER LIVED SHOULD GIGGLE AT HIM MUCH LESS LOCK HIM UP LIKE A SMALL CHILD
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN DO YOU ASKED MADAM STILL HOLDING HER BY THE CHIN
BUT THIS LITTLE COSTUME SUITS ME BEST DO YOU REALLY THINK I LOOK NICE AND POLLY'S FACE BRIGHTENED FOR SHE VALUED THE OLD LADY'S OPINION VERY MUCH
I D HAVE CUT OVER TO THE SMYTHES AND GOT MA HOME TO FIX THINGS ONLY IT LOOKED LIKE BACKING OUT OF THE SCRAPE
WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY OTHER PERMISSION MAUD RUSHED AWAY TO GET READY
WELL I DON'T CARE IF YOU DO TRY IT FOR I AM CONFOUNDEDLY TIRED AND TOM LAUGHED AS HE RECALLED THE FROLIC HE HAD BEEN ON THE NIGHT BEFORE
POLLY WAS VERY TIRED AND SOON FELL ASLEEP
IT WILL SAVE BUYING AND YOU CAN GO TO YOUR STOCK ANY TIME AND MAKE OVER WHAT YOU WANT
I M SO ASHAMED OF THOSE GIRLS WHISPERED POLLY TAKING A LONG BREATH OF RELIEF
IF YOU WON'T GO AND MAKE A FUSS TELLING WHAT YOU D NO RIGHT TO HEAR IT WAS SO MEAN TO HIDE AND LISTEN
DID YOU SAY THAT
THE LITTLE GIRLS WANT TO GO THIS IS THEIR SLED LET EM TAKE IT IT IS N'T GOOD FOR MUCH
WELL YOU DRESS LIKE A LITTLE GIRL FOR ONE THING I AM A LITTLE GIRL
LET S BE JUST AS JOLLY AS WE CAN WHILE SHE STAYS AND FINISH UP WITH YOUR PARTY FAN SAID TOM IN A TONE THAT SETTLED THE MATTER
OH MY DEAR
BUT SHE DID N'T FIGHT SCREAM AND SQUABBLE WITH HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THIS DISGRACEFUL WAY AND WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE HER ELEGANT FRIEND IN SUCH A PASSION
WAS YOURS RETURNED BLANCHE
SHE S A CAPITAL GIRL AND SHE OUGHT TO MARRY A MISSIONARY OR ONE OF YOUR REFORMER FELLOWS AND BE A SHINING LIGHT OF SOME SORT
YES MY DEARS HERE IS JUST THE SPOT WHERE THE DEAR OLD MAN SALUTED ME
I LIKE THOSE BECAUSE THERE IS HISTORY IN THEM SAID POLLY GLAD TO HAVE A WORD TO SAY FOR HERSELF
INDEED SHE WAS SO SHOCKED WHEN POLLY ONE DAY PROPOSED A RUN DOWN THE MALL THAT HER FRIEND NEVER DARED SUGGEST SUCH A THING AGAIN
LESSONS CHAPTER 10
FOLLOWING HER GUIDE POLLY WAS TAKEN TO THE BIG CHINA CLOSET OPENING FROM THE DINING-ROOM TO THE KITCHEN AND HERE SHE FOUND A JOVIAL LITTLE PARTY FEASTING AT EASE
BUT IN THE WELL-MADE CAKE THE PLUMS ARE WISELY SCATTERED ALL THROUGH AND EVERY MOUTHFUL IS A PLEASURE
OH HAVE YOU READ THE PHANTOM BRIDE
BUT HE DID N'T WISH IT
PRIDE AND PENITENCE MADE HIM SHRINK OUT OF SIGHT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR HE COULD NOT BEAR PITY EVEN WHEN SILENTLY EXPRESSED BY A FRIENDLY HAND OR A KINDLY EYE
THAT WILL MAKE A LOVELY SUIT CRIED POLLY GOING ON WITH THE REVIEW
I KNOW HE IS OR WILL BE
COME ON THEN AND HELP ME SHAKE I SAID GETTING UP EAGER FOR THE FUN
I WISH YOU COULD
SEE WHAT LOTS HAVE COME DOWN WITH ME SO THERE HAD FOR MY FALL SHOOK THE TREE ALMOST AS MUCH AS IT DID ME AND THE GREEN AND PURPLE FRUIT LAY ALL ABOUT US
OCCASIONALLY A MATRIMONIAL EPIDEMIC APPEARS ESPECIALLY TOWARD SPRING DEVASTATING SOCIETY THINNING THE RANKS OF BACHELORDOM AND LEAVING MOTHERS LAMENTING FOR THEIR FAIREST DAUGHTERS
DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT THE SUIT OF CLOTHES HE S JUST GOT WOULD HAVE COST A GOOD DEAL MORE IF YOUR TAILOR HAD N'T MADE THEM
THERE THEY ARE
NEVER MIND YOUR BONNET I CAN'T WAIT AND POUNCING UPON POLLY MAUD DRAGGED HER AWAY LIKE A CAPTURED SHIP TOWED BY A NOISY LITTLE STEAM-TUG
I DON'T WISH TO BE RUDE BUT I DID N'T ANSWERED POLLY
WELL I AM BUT NOT WITH HER OH AND POLLY CAUGHT HER BREATH AS IF A DASH OF COLD WATER HAD FALLEN ON HER FOR THE MORE IN EARNEST TOM GREW THE BLUNTER HE BECAME
SUCH A ROGUE AS THAT BOY WAS BUT DID N'T THE ROBBERS EVER COME CRIED TOM ENJOYING THE JOKE BUT FEELING DEFRAUDED OF THE FIGHT
VERY VERY MUCH MY PATIENT LITTLE POLLY DID YOU REALLY CARE FOR ME BEFORE YOU WENT SEE IF I DID N'T AND WITH GREAT PRIDE TOM PRODUCED A PORTLY POCKET-BOOK STUFFED WITH BUSINESS-LIKE DOCUMENTS OF A MOST IMPOSING APPEARANCE OPENED A PRIVATE COMPARTMENT AND TOOK OUT A WORN-LOOKING PAPER UNFOLDED IT CAREFULLY AND DISPLAYED A SMALL BROWN OBJECT WHICH GAVE OUT A FAINT FRAGRANCE
GUESS I LL GO ROUND TO POLLY'S AND ASK WILL TO DRIVE OUT WITH ME AND SAVE HIM THE WALK POOR CHAP
FOR BOYS SELDOM HAVE CONFIDENCES OF THIS SORT EXCEPT WITH THEIR MOTHERS AND MRS SHAW HAD NEVER FOUND THE KEY TO HER SON'S HEART
THE FIRE WAS LOW THE GAS DIM AND MR SHAW WAS SITTING IN HIS EASY-CHAIR HIS GRAY HEAD IN BOTH HIS HANDS LOOKING LONELY OLD AND BOWED DOWN WITH CARE
I STUDIED WITH JIMMY AND KEPT UP WITH HIM FOR FATHER LET US BE TOGETHER IN ALL OUR LESSONS
WAS N'T THAT SWEET OF HER
LOOKS AS IF I SHIRKED AND RAN AWAY SO IT DOES SAID POLLY DECIDEDLY
THAT WILL GIVE ME A FORTY-MAN-POWER AND I LL PAY UP MY DEBTS AND GET A GOOD START AND THEN NED AND I WILL BE MARRIED AND GO INTO PARTNERSHIP AND WE LL ALL BE THE HAPPIEST BUSIEST PEOPLE IN THE WEST IT SOUNDS DELIGHTFUL
GOOD NIGHT DEAR
NELLY GOT STUNG BY A WASP MY HEAD BEGAN TO ACHE AND WE SAT LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER RATHER DISMALLY WHEN NELLY HAD A BRIGHT IDEA
I M ALL RIGHT ENOUGH AS YOU LL SEE WHEN I M IN ORDER
SHE HAD HEARD OF POVERTY AND SUFFERING IN THE VAGUE FAR-OFF WAY WHICH IS ALL THAT MANY GIRLS SAFE IN HAPPY HOMES EVER KNOW OF IT
HELP ME TO BEGIN AGAIN AND I LL DO BETTER SO I TOLD HER SHE WAS MY CHILD NOW AND MIGHT REST HERE SURE OF A HOME AS LONG AS I HAD ONE AS MISS MILLS SPOKE IN HER MOTHERLY TONE AND CAST A PROUD AND HAPPY LOOK TOWARD THE WARM AND QUIET NEST IN WHICH SHE HAD SHELTERED THIS FRIENDLESS LITTLE SPARROW FEELING SURE THAT GOD MEANT HER TO KEEP IT FROM FALLING TO THE GROUND POLLY PUT BOTH ARMS ABOUT HER NECK AND KISSED HER WITHERED CHEEK WITH AS MUCH LOVING REVERENCE AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A SPLENDID SAINT FOR IN THE LIKENESS OF THIS PLAIN OLD MAID SHE SAW THE LOVELY CHARITY THAT BLESSES AND SAVES THE WORLD
IT S TOO BAD FOR SHE WAS THE JOLLIEST THING I EVER KNEW POLLY HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO LIVELY MISS BELLE
MISS MILLS ALWAYS MANAGES TO FIND A CORNER FOR STRAY PEOPLE BUT HE INSISTS ON GOING SO AS TO GET TO WORK EARLY TO-MORROW SAID POLLY DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT TOM WAS TAKING OFF HIS COAT AS IF HE MEANT TO WAIT FOR MAUD'S APPLE WHICH POLLY BLESSED FOR BEING SO SLOW TO COOK
ONE MORE WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THE PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN AND THE LITTLE GLASS REFLECTED A GRATIFIED FACE FOR THE SPACE OF TWO SECONDS
MOTHER BORROWED A RATTLE AND KEPT IT UNDER HER PILLOW
THIS IS DREADFUL CRIED POLLY BREATHLESSLY AFTER A FEW WILD TURNS
DID THIS SURPRISE YOU HE ASKED AS A LITTLE WHITE SHOWER FLUTTERED FROM HIS HANDS
I DID N'T APPROVE OF HIM AT ALL
GET AWAY SAID MAUD SHAKING A STICKY SPOON AT HIM
I WAS CHARMED WITH HIM AND RATHER SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT HE WROTE THE POEMS WHICH WERE SO MUCH ADMIRED LAST SEASON ALSO THAT HE IS THE SON OF A RICH TAILOR
BUT IT WON'T SEEM DRUDGERY NOW FOR YOU LL WRITE EVERY DAY AND I SHALL FEEL THAT I M WORKING TO GET A HOME FOR YOU
NOW MAKE YOUR CUSTARDS DEAR
FANNY SAID NO MORE FOR SHE FELT QUITE SURE THAT POLLY WOULD RELENT WHEN THE TIME CAME AND SHE PLANNED TO GIVE HER A PRETTY DRESS FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT SO THAT ONE EXCUSE SHOULD BE REMOVED
SUPPOSE WE CUT IT
THEN QUITE NATURALLY THE CONVERSATION FELL UPON THE GREAT WORK THAT NONE SHOULD BE TOO BUSY TO THINK OF AND WHICH FEW ARE TOO YOUNG OR TOO POOR TO HELP ON WITH THEIR MITE
BUT I M AFRAID YOUR YEAR HAS BEEN HARDER THAN MINE YOU LOOK SO MUCH OLDER AND GRAVER THAN WHEN YOU WENT AWAY
YES OF BEING NOBODY AH BUT YOU AIN'T NOBODY YOU RE POLLY AND YOU COULD N'T BETTER THAT IF YOU TRIED EVER SO HARD SAID TOM WARMLY FOR HE REALLY WAS FOND OF POLLY AND FELT UNCOMMONLY SO JUST THEN
FIDDLESTICK
WHAT A COUNTRIFIED THING ANNE MUST HAVE BEEN
THE BABIES WERE OUT IN FULL FORCE LOOKING AS GAY AND DELICATE AND SWEET AS THE SNOW-DROPS HYACINTHS AND DAFFODILS ON THE BANKS WHENCE THE SNOW HAD MELTED
HE GOT HIS BOOKS BUT DID NOT READ THEM
IT HAD BEEN A DULL NOVEMBER DAY BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CLOUDS LIFTED AND A BRIGHT RAY SHOT INTO THE ROOM
IF MR SYDNEY COULD SEE YOU NOW HE WOULD N'T THINK YOU SUCH AN ANGEL ANY MORE ADDED FANNY TOSSING A BEAN-BAG AND HER HEAD AT THE SAME TIME
ADDING ALOUD IN A TONE OF CALM RESIGNATION THAT ASSURED POLLY HIS HEART WOULD NOT BE BROKEN THOUGH HIS ENGAGEMENT WAS IT NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS SPECIALLY IN HARD TIMES BUT WHEN A MAN IS DOWN A RAP OR TWO MORE DON'T MATTER MUCH I SUPPOSE
IN A MINUTE EVERY ONE WAS AWAKE AND UP FOR JACK FIRED HIS PISTOL BEFORE HE WAS HALF OUT OF BED AND ROARED FIRE SO LOUD IT ROUSED THE HOUSE
FOR WHEN I D DONE HE ONLY SAID MY POOR LAD WE MUST BEAR WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THEN TOLD HIS STORY I M GLAD HE WAS KIND BEGAN POLLY IN A SOOTHING TONE
DON'T YOU BE WORRIED
WISH I D LEARNED A TRADE AND HAD SOMETHING TO FALL BACK UPON
I JUST HAD A ROW WITH THE CHAPEL WATCHMAN AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN
IT WAS A LARGE OPEN FIRE-PLACE WITH THE COALS NICELY COVERED UP AND THE BIG KETTLE SIMMERING ON THE HOOK
NO NO I WANT TO DO WID WILLY AND HE WON'T LET ME
BUT POLLY HAD NO ORNAMENT EXCEPT THE PLAIN LOCKET ON A BIT OF BLUE VELVET
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN AGAINST HIM AND HE HAS FOUGHT ALL ALONE TO STAND THE PRESSURE BUT IT S TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE S GIVEN IN
SUCH THINGS ARE GREAT FUN WHEN YOU GET USED TO THEM
INDEED I WILL DO ALL I CAN
WELL SAID POLLY SLOWLY I JUST TRY TO LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THINGS
I LL THINK ABOUT IT
I TRIED TO COMFORT HIM AND WE HAD TWO OR THREE REAL SWEET LITTLE TALKS TOGETHER AND SEEMED TO GET ACQUAINTED FOR THE FIRST TIME
SHE KNEW HE ADMIRED HER ONE TALENT RESPECTED HER INDEPENDENCE AND ENJOYED HER SOCIETY
THEY SHAN'T HAVE MY NEW EAR-RINGS I LL HIDE EM AND MY BEST DRESS AND MY GOLD SMELLING BOTTLE
HE HAD JUST TIME TO GET THINGS IN ORDER WHEN FANNY CAME UP CROSSER THAN EVER
AND NOW AND THEN SHE WISHED THAT HER BLUE AND MOUSE COLORED MERINOS WERE RATHER MORE TRIMMED HER SASHES HAD BIGGER BOWS AND HER LITTLE RUFFLES MORE LACE ON THEM
AS SHE SMILED AND WAVED HER BAG AT HIM HE STOPPED AND WAITED FOR HER SAYING TO HIMSELF HULLO
NOW TOM YOU MUST DANCE THIS WITH POLLY
I LIKE LATIN AND USED TO GET ON WELL WHEN I STUDIED IT WITH JIMMY
JENNY AND I ARE GOING TO HELP
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE PILLOW I COULD DO THAT FOR YOU CAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE MORE TIRED OF STUDYING THAN WILL SAID MAUD WITH SOME HESITATION BUT AN EVIDENT DESIRE TO BE USEFUL AND AGREEABLE
THE MUSIC AND THE LIGHT COSTUME AND COMPANY EXCITED POLLY AND MADE MANY THINGS POSSIBLE WHICH AT MOST TIMES SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF SAYING OR DOING
THE MUSIC IS ALL VERY FINE I KNOW BUT IT DOES SEEM SO ABSURD FOR PEOPLE TO GO ROUND TELLING TREMENDOUS SECRETS AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES
WE ALL CONFIDE IN YOU
YES SHE SAID HOPEFULLY I KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED FOR THE BEST THING A MAN CAN HAVE IS WORK WITH A PURPOSE IN IT AND THE WILL TO DO IT HEARTILY THERE IS ONE BETTER THING POLLY ANSWERED TOM TURNING HER FACE UP A LITTLE THAT HE MIGHT SEE HIS INSPIRATION SHINING IN HER EYES
BUT IT S NICE AND COSY AND YOU MAY WARM YOUR HANDS IN IT IF YOU WANT TO SAID POLLY SURVEYING HER NEW WOOLLEN GLOVES WITH A DISSATISFIED LOOK THOUGH SHE HAD THOUGHT THEM QUITE ELEGANT BEFORE
LIKE A LAMB
AT LAST WE HEARD A CRICKET CHIRP SHRILLY UNDER THE WINDOW AND FLYING UP SAW A LITTLE FIGURE BELOW IN THE TWILIGHT
OR LOST IN BOUNDLESS FORESTS WHERE THE YOUNG HEROES HAVE THRILLING ADVENTURES KILL IMPOSSIBLE BEASTS AND WHEN THE AUTHOR'S INVENTION GIVES OUT SUDDENLY FIND THEIR WAY HOME LADEN WITH TIGER SKINS TAME BUFFALOES AND OTHER PLEASING TROPHIES OF THEIR PROWESS
HERE S BELLE'S BROTHER GUS HE ALWAYS GOES
I THINK IT WAS FUN
HE GAVE ME HIS BOOKS AND HIS DOG AND HIS SPECKLED HENS AND HIS BIG KNIFE AND SAID GOOD-BY POLLY AND KISSED ME THE LAST THING AND THEN O JIMMY
THEIR SEATS WERE IN THE BALCONY AND HARDLY WERE THEY SETTLED WHEN BY ONE OF THOSE REMARKABLE COINCIDENCES WHICH ARE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING IN OUR YOUTH MR SYDNEY AND FANNY'S OLD FRIEND FRANK MOORE TOOK THEIR PLACES JUST BEHIND THEM
FANNY AS WE HAVE SEEN WAS STRICKEN FIRST AND HARDLY HAD SHE BEEN CARRIED SAFELY THROUGH THE CRISIS WHEN TOM RETURNED TO SWELL THE LIST OF VICTIMS
AND WHEN FANNY SAID WITH A SATISFIED SMILE HOW DO WE LOOK SHE ANSWERED DRAWING POLLY TOWARD HER SO KINDLY
I LIKE IT AND I M GOING TO DO IT NOW I VE GOT A CHANCE
COASTING IS NO HARM
AT THE SOUND OF MISS COTTON'S HORRIFIED EXCLAMATION SALLY WOKE UP AND BEGAN LAUGHING SO MERRILY THAT NONE OF US COULD RESIST FOLLOWING HER EXAMPLE AND THE ROOMS RANG WITH MERRIMENT FAR MANY MINUTES
I DON'T KNOW MUCH AND THAT S THE REASON WHY I M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO WILL
GUESS I AM SIR VERY GOOD
I WONDER WHY SUCH A LOVE OF CONQUEST WAS PUT INTO US
IF YOU COULD SEND ME THE ROSY CHEEKS BRIGHT EYES AND GAY SPIRITS I ALWAYS HAD AT HOME I D THANK YOU
THAT MUSIC SETS ME ALL IN A TWITTER AND I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED NICE IN FAN'S BLUE TARLATAN AND I KNOW I COULD BEHAVE AS WELL AS ANY ONE AND HAVE LOTS OF PARTNERS THOUGH I M NOT IN THAT SET
I WILL IF YOU DON'T THINK THIS IS NICE ENOUGH
SHE APPRECIATED IT AND FORGAVE HIM IN HER HEART SOME TIME BEFORE SHE DID WITH HER LIPS
ALL RIGHT RETURNED THE PERJURED BOY WHO HAD DISCOVERED THAT A BROKEN HEAD WAS SOMETIMES MORE USEFUL THAN A WHOLE ONE AND EXULTING IN HIS BASE STRATAGEM HE ROVED ABOUT THE ROOM TILL FAN'S BUREAU ARRESTED HIM
WHEN THEY PARTED FOR THE NIGHT POLLY SLIPPED AWAY FIRST TO LEAVE THEM FREE YET COULD N'T HELP LINGERING OUTSIDE TO SEE HOW TENDERLY THE GIRLS PARTED FROM THEIR FATHER
HE WAS MORE AT LEISURE NOW AND AS HIS BOY AND GIRLS GREW UP HE MISSED SOMETHING
BUT WE WERE NOT AFRAID OF BEING SEEN FOR THE STREET WAS A LONELY ONE AND OUR ONLY NEIGHBORS TWO OLD LADIES WHO PUT DOWN THEIR CURTAINS AT SUNSET AND NEVER LOOKED OUT TILL MORNING
HOPING TO PROPITIATE HER TORMENTOR FAN INVITED TOM TO JOIN IN THE REVEL AND POLLY BEGGED THAT MAUD MIGHT SIT UP AND SEE THE FUN
DO YOU SEE HE S NOT ONLY PAID THE CONFOUNDED DEBTS BUT HAS DONE IT IN MY NAME TO SPARE ME ALL HE COULD I SEE IT S LIKE HIM
WON'T YOU I D RATHER NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT
WE SOON GOT BACK INTO THE OLD WAY AND NOW WE HECTOR ONE ANOTHER JUST AS BEFORE FANNY SIGHED THEN YAWNED AND FELL INTO HER USUAL LISTLESS ATTITUDE AS IF THE BRIEF EXCITEMENT OF POLLY'S COMING HAD BEGUN TO SUBSIDE
I M GOING TO DRESS A DOLLY FOR MY LITTLE SISTER
BUT HE DID N'T BRING HALF I GAVE FOR HIM
TOM HAD N'T A WORD TO SAY FOR HIMSELF FOR MEN DON'T KISS CARESS OR CRY WHEN THEY FEEL MOST AND ALL HE COULD DO TO EXPRESS HIS SYMPATHY AND PENITENCE WAS TO WRING HIS FATHER'S HAND WITH A FACE FULL OF RESPECT REGRET AND AFFECTION AND THEN BOLT UP STAIRS AS IF THE FURIES WERE AFTER HIM AS THEY WERE IN A MILD AND MODERN FORM
I HOPE HE IS N'T BAD CRIED FAN ANXIOUSLY STILL HOLDING POLLY WHO KEPT HER HEAD OBSTINATELY TURNED
SO I SIT IN A CORNER AND SEW WHILE THEY CHATTER AND LAUGH WOULD N'T IT BE A GOOD CHANCE TO SAY A WORD FOR JENNY
SO AM I FOR IT STRIKES ME THAT IS AN UNCOMMONLY NOBBY LITTLE AFFAIR HE SAID APPROVINGLY
POOR POLLY WITH ALL HER EFFORTS TO BE CONTENTED AND NOT TO MIND LOOKING UNLIKE OTHER PEOPLE FOUND IT HARD WORK TO KEEP HER FACE BRIGHT AND HER VOICE HAPPY THAT NIGHT
AND IF ANY ONE HAD ASKED HER JUST THEN WHAT MADE HER SIGH AS IF SOMETHING LAY HEAVY ON HER CONSCIENCE SHE WOULD HAVE ANSWERED BRONZE BOOTS CHAPTER IV
NOT BAD
GRANDMA PROVED EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY AND PLANNED SOMETHING FOR EVERY ONE SUPPLYING MATERIALS TASTE AND SKILL IN THE MOST DELIGHTFUL MANNER
SO TAKING COURAGE HE SAT DOWN ON THE BOOT-JACK AND BEGGED PARDON LIKE A MAN
SLOWLY SHE SAT DOWN AND HESITATINGLY SHE SAID WITH HER EYES ON THE GROUND AND A VERY HUMBLE VOICE I LL DO MY BEST BUT I CAN'T FILL GRANDMA'S PLACE OR GIVE YOU ANY WISE GOOD ADVICE
YES YOU CAN JUST HEM THE SKIRT WHILE I PUT IN THE SLEEVES AND THAT WILL BE A GREAT LIFT POLLY PUT ON HER THIMBLE IN SILENCE BUT AS MISS MILLS SPREAD THE WHITE FLANNEL OVER HER LAP SHE EXCLAIMED WHY IT LOOKS LIKE A SHROUD
THE PUPILS WERE UNUSUALLY STUPID AND TWO OF THEM ANNOUNCED THAT THEIR MAMMA WAS GOING TO TAKE THEM TO THE SOUTH WHITHER SHE WAS SUDDENLY CALLED
THEN HIS EYE FELL UPON THE DIMPLES IN POLLY'S ELBOWS AND HE ADDED WITH A LAUGH THAT S MORE IN YOUR LINE MA'AM
YES THERE WILL
FATHER'S BOOK AND MOTHER'S COLLAR ARE IMPOSSIBLE NOW
YOU DID MANY A KIND AND GENEROUS THING FOR BELLE WHEN YOU HAD THE POWER AND YOU LIKED TO DO IT
THE REFRESHMENTS WERE SOMEWHAT INJURED BY SALLY'S BOUNCING IN AMONG THEM BIT WE DID N'T CARE AND SOON FINISHED THE CAKE
HURRAH CRIED I LETTING GO ONE BRANCH AND TRYING TO REACH ANOTHER
BUT YOU MAY ADD AS MUCH ROMANCE AS YOU LIKE IT S TIME YOU DID I M READY FOR IT WHEN IT COMES BUT IT CAN'T BE FORCED YOU KNOW AND POLLY BLUSHED AND SMILED AS IF SOME LITTLE SPICE OF THAT DELIGHTFUL THING HAD STOLEN INTO HER LIFE FOR ALL ITS PROSAIC SEEMING
I CAN'T GET WORK THAT PAYS ENOUGH TO KEEP ME
FOR WHILE IT DID TOM'S HEART GOOD TO SEE THE CORDIAL RESPECT PAID TO HIS FATHER IT TRIED HIS PATIENCE SORELY TO SEE ALSO INQUISITIVE OR DISAPPROVING GLANCES FIXED UPON HIMSELF WHEN HATS WERE LIFTED TO HIS FATHER AND TO HEAR THE HEARTY GOOD DAY MR SHAW DROP INTO A COOL OR CARELESS THAT S THE SON
I HAVE N'T THE TALENT FOR MANAGING PEOPLE BUT I SEE WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE WELL DON'T WAIL ABOUT IT
SO YOU D BETTER HAND OVER I KNOW YOU ARE
MISS COTTON MARCHED INTO THE NEXT ROOM PUT THE SAME QUESTION AND RECEIVED THE SAME REPLY
BUT SHE HEARD EVERY WORD NEVERTHELESS AND RESOLVED TO PAY HIM FOR HIS IMPERTINENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BY SHOWING HIM WHAT HE HAD LOST
DOES SHE WANT IT POLLY ASKED FAN WHOSE CURIOSITY GOT THE BETTER OF HER PRIDE
STARTLED AT FIRST THEN SOFTENING WITH PLEASURE AT SIGHT OF THE BONNY FACE BEFORE THEM AND THEN A HUMBLE BESEECHING EXPRESSION FILLED THEM AS IF ASKING PARDON FOR THE RASH ACT NEARLY COMMITTED AND PITY FOR THE HARD FATE THAT PROMPTED IT
I DON'T SEE WHAT WE GIRLS CAN DO MORE THAN WE DO NOW
POLLY WENT HOME FOR THE SUMMER
WHAT'S THE CHICKEN RUFFLING UP HER LITTLE FEATHERS AND PECKING AT ME FOR
MAZEPPA'S A STUNNER
FOR TOM IN HIS FRANTIC EFFORTS TO DO HIS DUTY NEARLY ANNIHILATED POOR POLLY
I CAN'T FIND IT AND THIS ONE IS PRETTY WELL CHEWED UP SAID TOM BEREAVING SNIP OF THE TORN KID TO WHICH HE STILL PERTINACIOUSLY CLUNG
NOW YOU MUST GO TO SLEEP
NO DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT MY POOR DEAR
WE USED TO RUSH WHEN A BUNDLE CAME AND SIT ROUND WHILE MOTHER OPENED IT
I THINK IF WE MEET ONCE A WEEK IT IS ALL THAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF US WITH OUR OTHER ENGAGEMENTS
THE DR SAYS I CAN'T BE WELL UNLESS I REST
TALKING OF EARLY DAYS MADE HIM WISH HE COULD GO BACK AND START AGAIN DOING BETTER
I HAVE MINE CHARGED
IN MY DAY CHILDREN OF FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN DID N'T DRESS IN THE HEIGHT OF THE FASHION
SO ALL FOUR DESCENDED TO THE BIG KITCHEN ARMED WITH APRONS HAMMERS SPOONS AND PANS AND POLLY ASSUMED COMMAND OF THE FORCES
I CAN'T GO TILL MY APPLE IS DONE
MAUD USED TO BEG TO COME TO TEA AND POLLY GLAD TO DO ANYTHING FOR THOSE WHO HAD DONE A GOOD DEAL FOR HER MADE A POINT OF CALLING FOR THE LITTLE GIRL AS THEY CAME HOME FROM THEIR WALK OR SENDING WILL TO ESCORT HER IN THE CARRIAGE WHICH MAUD ALWAYS MANAGED TO SECURE IF BAD WEATHER THREATENED TO QUENCH HER HOPES
A KIND LITTLE THOUGHT AN UNSELFISH LITTLE ACT A CHEERY LITTLE WORD ARE SO SWEET AND COMFORTABLE THAT NO ONE CAN FAIL TO FEEL THEIR BEAUTY AND LOVE THE GIVER NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY ARE
I ONLY WANT TO KEEP YOU OUT OF A SCRAPE FOR FAN WILL BE RAGING IF YOU GO
YOU WILL FIND FATHER'S FACE ON ONE SIDE MINE ON THE OTHER
AND ON EITHER SIDE OF HER SAT MADAM STORER AND MADAM WILLIAMS ELEGANT TO BEHOLD IN THEIR STIFF SILKS RICH LACE AND STATELY TURBANS
BUT I WON'T SO DON'T TROUBLE YOUR KIND HEART ABOUT ME
POLLY HAD BEEN TAUGHT THAT IT WAS A VERY SERIOUS AND SACRED THING
POLLY HAD HER DOUBTS ABOUT FAN'S APPROVAL OF THAT SORT OF THING BUT DARED NOT SAY A WORD AND STOOD THINKING HOW SHE USED TO SHOW HER FATHER THE FUNNY VALENTINES THE BOYS SENT HER AND HOW THEY LAUGHED OVER THEM TOGETHER
NOBODY CAN ASK ME TO DO ANY MORE IF THEY REMEMBER ALL I VE GOT TO ATTEND TO BEFORE SUMMER SAID TRIX WITH AN IMPORTANT AIR
SHE MIGHT WEAR FLOWERS
DON'T YOU THINK HE D RATHER HAVE IT TOLD HIM NICELY BY YOU THAN BLURTED OUT AS I ALWAYS DO BLURT THINGS I KNOW HE D RATHER HAVE HIS SON GO TO HIM AND TELL THE TRUTH LIKE A MAN INSTEAD OF SENDING A GIRL TO DO WHAT HE IS AFRAID TO DO HIMSELF IF POLLY HAD SUDDENLY BOXED HIS EARS TOM COULD N'T HAVE LOOKED MORE TAKEN ABACK THAN BY THAT BURST
POLLY WON'T MIND IF WE ARE POOR CAUSE SHE LIKES BEGGARS IS THAT WHO YOU MEANT ASKED FAN WISTFULLY
TOM DID DECLAIM WELL FOR HE QUITE FORGOT HIMSELF AND DELIVERED THE STIRRING BALLAD WITH AN ENERGY THAT MADE POLLY FLUSH AND TINGLE WITH ADMIRATION AND DELIGHT AND QUITE ELECTRIFIED A SECOND LISTENER WHO HAD HEARD ALL THAT WENT ON AND WATCHED THE LITTLE SCENE FROM BEHIND HIS NEWSPAPER
YOU DON'T COME VERY OFTEN SO WE ARE RATHER OVER-POWERED WHEN YOU DO HONOR US SHE SAID DEMURELY
NOW DON'T PREACH BUT PUT MY CLOAK ON NICELY AND COME ALONG FOR I M TO MEET TOM AND TRIX AND PROMISED TO BE THERE EARLY POLLY WAS TO BE LEFT AT HOME AFTER DEPOSITING FAN AT BELLE'S
WHAT A FUSS ABOUT NOTHING SAID FANNY READY TO CRY WITH VEXATION
HE ALWAYS IS REMORSEFUL AFTER A SCRAPE I VE UNDERSTOOD FOR HE IS N'T A VERY BAD FELLOW ONLY HIS SPIRITS ARE ONE TOO MANY FOR HIM AND HE IS N'T AS FOND OF HIS BOOK AS ANOTHER FELLOW I KNOW I M AFRAID HE LL HE EXPELLED IF HE DON'T MIND SAID POLLY WARNINGLY
TOM HOPPING ONE WAY AND POLLY THE OTHER IN A MOST UNGRACEFUL MANNER
OF COURSE IT DOES
IT S WRONG OF YOU TO SAY SO
WHAT WILL YOU DO TOM I LL TELL YOU
SHE ENJOYED THE JOKE SO HEARTILY THAT TOM FORGOT CONSEQUENCES AND PROPOSED GOING DOWN INTO THE PARLOR TO SURPRISE THE GIRLS
RUN
DON'T SEE HOW TWO DRAGGLED SKIRTS AND A STAINED WAIST CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO A WHOLE RIG SAID FAN SITTING ON THE BED WITH HER GARMENTS STREWN ABOUT HER IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES OF LIMP DESPONDENCY
I ALWAYS DO IF I CAN
HE HAD NOT THE LEAST SUSPICION OF WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON AT HOME FOR FAN HAD SAID TO HERSELF WITH GIRLISH MALICE IF HE DON'T CHOOSE TO TELL ME HIS SECRETS I M NOT GOING TO TELL MINE AND HAD SAID NOTHING ABOUT SYDNEY EXCEPT AN OCCASIONAL ALLUSION TO HIS BEING OFTEN THERE AND VERY KIND
WELL THIS IS CHEERFUL HE SAID AS THE CLOCK STRUCK EIGHT AND HIS FOURTH CIGAR CAME TO AN END
AND THEN WHAT WILL POLLY THINK OF ME CRIED FANNY WITH THE IMPATIENT POKE WHICH IS PECULIARLY AGGRAVATING TO MASCULINE DIGNITY
COME WITH ME AND DON'T SIT STARVING HERE SAID TOM WITH A SCORNFUL LOOK FROM HER EMPTY PLATE TO THAT OF HER RECREANT ESCORT WHICH WAS PILED WITH GOOD THINGS
WHO ARE YOU GOING WITH ASKED MRS SHAW WHEN FANNY MENTIONED THAT IT WAS CONCERT-DAY JUST BEFORE THREE O'CLOCK
MRS DAVENPORT AND MOTHER ARE RELATIONS YOU KNOW YOU NEVER TOLD US THAT BEFORE THE DAVENPORTS HAVE BEEN AWAY SOME YEARS AND I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THEM
LET ME HELP YOU THEN
SHE SIGHED FOR A LOCKET AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE THOUGHT SERIOUSLY OF TURNING UP HER PRETTY CURLS AND PUTTING ON A WAD SHE KEPT THESE DISCONTENTS TO HERSELF HOWEVER AFTER SHE HAD WRITTEN TO ASK HER MOTHER IF SHE MIGHT HAVE HER BEST DRESS ALTERED LIKE FANNY'S AND RECEIVED THIS REPLY
YOU KNOW HOW
NOT MUCH
NOT MUCH
AND PERHAPS YOU LL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP THE GIRLS FROM BOTHERING ME WITH QUESTIONS AND GABBLE HE ADDED AS IF ON SECOND THOUGHTS HE WAS RELIEVED TO HAVE THE COMMUNICATION MADE TO POLLY FIRST
BUT MY DEAR I WANT YOU TO PROMISE THAT YOU WILL COME AND MAKE US A VISIT EVERY WINTER A GOOD LONG ONE SAID MR SHAW PATTING THE BLUE MITTENS FOLDED ROUND HIS HAND
ONCE UPON A TIME CONTINUED MADAM MUCH FLATTERED BY THE ROW OF INTERESTED FACES BEFORE HER MY FATHER WENT AWAY ON BUSINESS LEAVING MOTHER AUNT AND US GIRLS TO JACK'S CARE
IT HAD BEEN A DULL DAY
I DON'T WONDER YOU DREAD TELLING YOUR FATHER I D RATHER BE SHOT
IT WAS A REAL RAT
WHAT AN EASY LIFE I SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY QUANTITIES OF FRIENDS ALL SORTS OF PLEASURES AND NO WORK NO POVERTY NO COLD SHOULDERS OR PATCHED BOOTS
BUT I DON'T QUITE AGREE THAT THE REAL THING IS N'T INTERESTING
I THINK SHE IS GOING TO STAY AT HOME AND DO ALL THE WORK CAUSE SERVANTS COST SO MUCH
THAT WAS IN WAR TIMES 1812 MY DEAR AND UNCLE JOE WAS IN THE ARMY SO HE HAD TO GO AND HE TOOK THAT VERY LITTLE PIN-BALL WITH HIM
DEAR ME HOW WARM IT IS AND POLLY GAVE HIM A FROWN THAT DELIGHTED HIS SOUL
LONGING TO SEE A FRIENDLY FACE AND RECEIVE A KIND WORD SHE CROSSED OVER MEANING TO NOD AND SMILE AT LEAST
OH FAN TOLD ME YOU D GOT CURLY HAIR AND A FUNNY NOSE AND KEPT WHISTLING AND WORE A GRAY CAP PULLED OVER YOUR EYES
IS IT VERY BAD SHE ASKED SOFTLY FEELING AS IF ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN TO STAND STILL AND SEE TOM SO WRETCHED
OH FAN YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN MY TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO THE CITY SITTING AMONG MY GOODS AND CHATTELS IN A FARMER'S CART POLLY'S LAUGH WAS SO INFECTIOUS THAT EVERY ONE SMILED AND FORGOT TO BE SHOCKED AT HER PERFORMANCE
THAT PLEASED HIM BUT HE SAID NOTHING WOULD INDUCE HIM TO DO IT FOR IT WOULD N'T HELP MUCH AND WAS HARDLY ENOUGH TO KEEP HER COMFORTABLE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE MEANS TO DO ASKED POLLY ANXIOUSLY
WHEN ARE YOU AND BECKY GOING TO DISSOLVE PARTNERSHIP ASKED POLLY EAGER FOR NEWS OF ALL
IT S ALL LINED WITH GWEEN SILK AND THAT S NICER THAN OLD WED CLOTH CRIED MAUD RUFFLING UP LIKE AN INSULTED CHICKEN
WELL I DARE SAY IT IS N'T PROPER FOR YOU TO KNOW BUT I AM OLD ENOUGH NOW TO BE TOLD ANYTHING AND THOSE GIRLS BETTER MIND WHAT THEY SAY FOR I M NOT A STUPID CHIT LIKE BLANCHE
YES SAID POLLY UNCONSCIOUSLY GIVING THE STRONGEST STIMULUS TO HER BROTHER'S HOPE AND COURAGE
WHERE IN THUNDER IS SHE GROWLED TOM WALKING OFF IN HIGH DUDGEON
I REMEMBER ONE DAY WE D BEEN PLAYING HAVE A BALL AND WERE ALL RIGGED UP EVEN THE BOYS
FOR I ONLY CAME TO STAY A MONTH AND HERE I VE BEEN NEARLY SIX WEEKS ANSWERED POLLY FEELING AS IF SHE HAD BEEN ABSENT A YEAR
I WANT TO GO DOWN BUT I DARS N'T IT S SO STEEP SAID ONE OF THESE COMMON CHILDREN AS MAUD CALLED THEM
I HATE TO BE A BURDEN SO I M GOING AWAY NOT TO TROUBLE ANYBODY ANYMORE
AND WITH THE WORDS OUT TUMBLED THAT INCORRIGIBLE BOY RED IN THE FACE AND BREATHLESS WITH SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER
WONDER YOU HAVE N'T OBSERVED IT I HAVE IT WAS TOM'S TURN TO LOOK SURPRISED NOW FOR FANNY'S VOICE SOUNDED STRANGE TO HIM
I LIKE THE PLAIN OLD-FASHIONED CHURCHES BUILT FOR USE NOT SHOW WHERE PEOPLE MET FOR HEARTY PRAYING AND PREACHING AND WHERE EVERYBODY MADE THEIR OWN MUSIC INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO OPERA SINGERS AS WE DO NOW
WHAT IS IT DEAR A GOOD WOMAN TO LOVE AND HELP HIM ALL HIS LIFE AS YOU WILL ME PLEASE GOD EVEN THOUGH SHE IS OLD-FASHIONED WHISPERED POLLY WITH HAPPY EYES THE BRIGHTER FOR THEIR TEARS AS SHE LOOKED UP AT THE YOUNG MAN WHO THROUGH HER HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TRUEST SUCCESS AND WAS NOT ASHAMED TO OWE IT TO LOVE AND LABOR TWO BEAUTIFUL OLD FASHIONS THAT BEGAN LONG AGO WITH THE FIRST PAIR IN EDEN
I LOOK SO LOVELY SOMEONE MUST ADMIRE ME
POLLY WAS MUCH DISTURBED
YES MOTHER WILL ENJOY HER DINNER TWICE AS MUCH IF YOU ORDER IT THEN THEY BEGAN TO TALK BUSINESS WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT AS IF THEY FEARED THAT SOME TRACE OF SENTIMENT MIGHT DISGRACE THEIR MASCULINE DIGNITY
IT WOULD DO HER GOOD
YOU AIN'T AFRAID ARE YOU ASKED TOM WITH IMPLORING LOOK FOR HE DID N'T LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING SEWED A BIT
I FEEL AS IF I WAS GOING MYSELF SHE SAID AS THEY ROLLED ALONG
IT S AN HONORABLE FAILURE MIND YOU AND NO ONE CAN SAY A WORD AGAINST HIM
MOTHERS DO A DEAL OF THIS SORT OF THING UNSEEN UNTHANKED BUT FELT AND REMEMBERED LONG AFTERWARD AND NEVER LOST FOR THIS IS THE SIMPLE MAGIC THAT BINDS HEARTS TOGETHER AND KEEPS HOME HAPPY
I REALLY HAVE N'T TIME BUT I DO SOMETIMES LONG A LITTLE FOR THE QUIET THE PURE AIR AND THE GIRLISH AMUSEMENTS I USED TO ENJOY SO MUCH
WHY DON'T YOU TELL RIGHT OUT AND NOT DO IT ANY MORE IF HE DON'T WANT YOU TO SAID POLLY PERSUASIVELY
I D CUT AWAY TO AUSTRALIA IF IT WAS N'T FOR MOTHER
POLLY I M ASHAMED OF YOU
FOR THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE LOVES ME SEEMS TO MAKE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE SAID FANNY WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH MADE HER REALLY BEAUTIFUL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE
THE SUPERCILIOUS GLANCE WHICH ACCOMPANIED HER IRONICALLY POLITE SPEECH ROUSED POLLY WHO ANSWERED WITH SUDDEN COLOR AND THE KINDLING OF THE EYES THAT ALWAYS BETRAYED A PERTURBED SPIRIT I DON'T THINK MANY OF US WOULD ENJOY THAT SELFISH SORT OF PEACE WHILE LITTLE CHILDREN STARVE AND GIRLS NO OLDER THAN US KILL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEIR DREADFUL POVERTY LEAVES THEM NO CHOICE BUT SIN OR DEATH A SUDDEN LULL TOOK PLACE FOR THOUGH POLLY DID NOT RAISE HER VOICE IT WAS FULL OF INDIGNANT EMOTION AND THE MOST FRIVOLOUS GIRL THERE FELT A LITTLE THRILL OF SYMPATHY
WELL I CAN'T HELP IT SHE DOES AGGRAVATE ME SO AND POLLY GAVE THE CAT SUCH A TWEAK OF THE EAR THAT PUTTEL BOUNCED OUT OF HER LAP IN HIGH DUDGEON
I M USED TO GOOD MANNERS THOUGH I DO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY REPLIED POLLY RATHER WARMLY FOR SHE DID N'T LIKE TO BE PATRONIZED EVEN BY HER FRIENDS
EVENING WAS HIS HARDEST TIME FOR WANT OF EXERCISE MADE HIM AS RESTLESS AND NERVOUS AS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR A HEARTY LAD TO BE ON SUCH A SHORT NOTICE
GLAD OF IT
EVERYTHING IS SO QUEER AND HORRID I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO MAUD BEGAN TO CRY AND POLLY SAT DOWN ON THE STAIRS BESIDE HER TRYING TO COMFORT HER WHILE HER OWN THOUGHTS WERE FULL OF A VAGUE FEAR
GOODNESS NO
I VE BEEN NEEDING A GOOD CRY FOR SOME TIME AND NOW I SHALL BE ALL RIGHT
HERE S A PLUM FOR YOU AND POLLY THREW A PLUMP RAISIN INTO HIS MOUTH
DID N'T SHE LIKE TO BE CHAFFED ABOUT HER SWEETHEARTS
CHAPTER XVIII
SO HE MADE THE GIRLS IN THE KITCHEN LAUGH AND THEN CREPT UP THE BACK WAY HOPING TO MAKE IT ALL RIGHT WITH POLLY
THESE ATTRACTED FIRST BY POLLY'S CHEERFUL FACE MODEST MANNERS AND FAITHFUL WORK SOON FOUND IN HER SOMETHING MORE THAN A GOOD TEACHER
WHY TOM SHOULD LOOK TROUBLED AND TURN GRAVE ALL AT ONCE SHE COULD N'T UNDERSTAND BUT SHE LIKED TO SEE HIM STROKE HIS MOTHER'S CHEEK SO SOFTLY AS HE STOOD WITH HIS HEAD RESTING ON THE HIGH BACK OF HER CHAIR FOR POLLY FANCIED THAT HE FELT A MAN'S PITY FOR HER WEAKNESS AND WAS LEARNING A SON'S PATIENT LOVE FOR A MOTHER WHO HAD HAD MUCH TO BEAR WITH HIM
COME BE CLEVER AND HELP ME THERE S A DEAR
HE CAN'T POSSIBLY GET OUT ANYWHERE AND AS SOON WE VE CUT UP THE CANDY WE LL UNBOLT THE DOOR AND RUN
KEEP YOURSELF HAPPY IF YOU CAN
LIZZIE SMALL IS AN ENGRAVER AND DESIGNS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL LITTLE PICTURES
BESIDES IT S ONLY TOM SHE ADDED WITH A BITTER SMILE AS SHE THOUGHT OF TRIX
WHAT DO YOU SAY NED ANSWERED WHEN YOU ASKED ABOUT THIS INCONVENIENT GIRL SAID FANNY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
THIS WINTER HE HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN THE SUCCESS OF HER PLANS AND HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD TO HELP THEM BUT HE NEVER THOUGHT OF FAILING IN LOVE WITH POLLY TILL THAT NIGHT
TOM AND FANNY LAUGHED AT HER FANCY BUT SHE DID NOT TIRE OF IT FOR THE CHILD WAS LONELY AND FOUND SOMETHING IN THAT LITTLE ROOM WHICH THE GREAT HOUSE COULD NOT GIVE HER
AH MY DEAR IT S A VERY COMMON STORY AND THAT S THE SADDEST PART OF IT
AND I DON'T SEE WHY GIRLS NEED TO BE KEPT SO DREADFULLY CLOSE
DON'T BE SO FIERCE POLLY
POOR PUTTEL AFTER GAZING WISTFULLY OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE GAUNT CITY CATS SKULKING ABOUT THE YARD WOULD RETIRE TO THE RUG AND CURL HERSELF UP AS IF ALL HOPE OF FINDING CONGENIAL SOCIETY HAD FAILED
THAT S NOT SAYING MUCH FOR THEM MUTTERED TOM FEELING THAT POLLY OUGHT TO ADDRESS MORE OF HER CONVERSATION TO HIM
ON THEY CAME TRIX INTENT ON THE VIEW TOM STARING AT THE HANDSOME HORSE AND POLLY WITH RED CHECKS EXPECTANT EYES AND THE BROWN BUNDLE IN FULL SIGHT
WELL I TAKE THE LIBERTY TO DIFFER FROM YOU RETURNED TRIX PUTTING UP HER GLASS AND BESTOWING UPON POLLY HER MOST TOPLOFTICAL STARE AS THE GIRLS CALLED IT
OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN ASHAMED OF MYSELF
IT S NO HARM AND POLLY SHALL COAST IF SHE WANTS TO
ARE YOU ENJOYING YOURSELF POLLY ASKED MR SHAW WHO LOOKED IN NOW AND THEN TO REPORT TO GRANDMA THAT ALL WAS GOING WELL
DON'T KNOW AND DON'T CARE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE ALLOWED TO KEEP
BUT DON'T BE A GOOSE TOMMY WELL FAN TOLD ME TO BE ELEGANT SO I TRIED TO WHISPERED TOM ADDING AS HE CLUTCHED HIS PARTNER WITH A SOMEWHAT DESPERATE AIR HOLD ON TIGHT AND WE LL GET THROUGH SOMEHOW THE MUSIC STRUCK UP AND AWAY THEY WENT
THEN AS HER BUTTERFLY ACQUAINTANCES DESERTED HER SHE FOUND HER WAY INTO A HIVE OF FRIENDLY BEES WHO WELCOMED HER AND SHOWED HER HOW TO FIND THE HONEY THAT KEEPS LIFE SWEET AND WHOLESOME
BUT THEY DID NOT GET RIGHT BY AND BY
AND I M A SELFISH THING TO GO AND SPEND ALL MY MONEY FOR MYSELF
POLLY WAS JUST FINISHING OFF WITH ONE DELICIOUS GO ALL BY HERSELF WHEN SHE HEARD A FAMILIAR WHISTLE BEHIND HER AND BEFORE SHE COULD GET OFF UP CAME TOM LOOKING AS MUCH ASTONISHED AS IF HE HAD FOUND HER MOUNTED ON AN ELEPHANT
DON'T SCARE MOTHER I M ALL RIGHT
NOW HERE S THE OTHER BY A MODERN GIRL ON HER FIRST VISIT TO LONDON
AH JUST WAIT TILL THE CARRIAGE GOES AND THE NICE CLOTHES AND THE SERVANTS AND WE HAVE TO SCRATCH ALONG AS WE CAN
I M SO TIRED OF EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IT SEEMS SOMETIMES AS IF I SHOULD DIE OF ENNUI
BUT HOW CAME YOU TO BE SO WISE MA'AM OBSERVATION SIR
I VE BEEN SO BUSY
FAN IS GOING TO A PARTY TO-NIGHT
AND READING MY JOURNAL AND LAUGHING AT MY PRESENTS AND THEN PUTTING THE BLAME ON MAUD
IT S TOO BAD
ASHPUTTEL AND NICK DID THEIR BEST TO CHEER HER BUT THEY TOO SEEMED TO PINE FOR COUNTRY FREEDOM AND HOME ATMOSPHERE
BUT BY AND BY THAT BITTER WEED ENVY CROPPED UP AGAIN AND SHE COULD NOT FEEL HAPPY TO BE LEFT OUT IN THE COLD WHILE THE OTHER GIRLS WERE GETTING GAY TISSUE-PAPER SUITS DROLL BONBONS FLOWERS RIBBONS AND ALL MANNER OF TASTEFUL TRIFLES IN WHICH GIRLISH SOULS DELIGHT
SO I LL GIVE IT UP AND LET TOM THINK I M AFRAID
TOM WAS SET TO CRACKING NUTS AND MAUD TO PICKING OUT THE MEATS FOR THE CANDY WAS TO BE TIP-TOP FAN WAITED ON POLLY COOK WHO HOVERED OVER THE KETTLE OF BOILING MOLASSES TILL HER FACE WAS THE COLOR OF A PEONY
HE S A BOY AND ACTS LIKE ONE AND I CAN GET ON WITH HIM A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN I CAN WITH THOSE MEN FANNY WAS JUST GOING TO TAKE POLLY TO TASK FOR SAYING THOSE MEN IN SUCH A DISRESPECTFUL TONE WHEN BOTH WERE STARTLED BY A SMOTHERED COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO FROM UNDER THE OPPOSITE SEAT
O QUICK
FOR SHUTTING HIMSELF UP IN THE LITTLE ROOM CALLED TOM'S DEN HE JUST SAT DOWN AND BROODED
ESCORTED BY THIS IMPRESSIVE YOUTH FANNY LEFT HER UNFORTUNATE FRIENDS TO RETURN TO SCHOOL AND WENT TO WALK AS SHE CALLED A SLOW PROMENADE DOWN THE MOST CROWDED STREETS
PEOPLE DO MANY THINGS IN THE COUNTRY THAT ARE NOT PROPER HERE BEGAN MRS SHAW IN HER REPROVING TONE
LET S GO AND PLAY IN THE DWYING-WOOM SAID MAUD WHO FOUND THE CONVERSATION GETTING BEYOND HER DEPTH
WELL I WON'T DO IT ANY MORE AND THAT WILL SPARE FAN ONE AFFLICTION
SAVE IT I WILL AND TOM GAVE CHASE WITH MORE VIGOR THAN DISCRETION
I LIKE TO WATCH FACES AND I SELDOM SEE A GROWN-UP ONE THAT LOOKS PERFECTLY HAPPY TRUE FOR YOU POLLY
THAT HAT IS PERFECTLY LOVELY THEY KNOW A LADY WHEN THEY SEE HER AND TRIX DON'T LOOK LIKE ONE
DID YOU MISS ME VERY MUCH YES TOM
HERE S FUN SAID POLLY AS SHE WAS RECEIVED WITH A CLASH OF SPOONS AND A WAVING OF NAPKINS
I DON'T THINK I VE EATEN ANY PIES SINCE THAT HAD SUCH A DELICIOUS FLAVOR AS THOSE BROKEN ONES EATEN HASTILY IN THAT LITTLE OVEN OF A ROOM WITH SALLY MAKING JOKES AND THE OTHERS ENJOYING STOLEN SWEETS WITH TRUE GIRLISH RELISH
THE PARENTS OF SOME OF HER PUPILS WERE PERSONS OF REAL REFINEMENT AND SUCH ARE ALWAYS QUICK TO PERCEIVE THE MARKS OF CULTURE IN OTHERS NO MATTER WHERE THEY FIND THEM
SEIZING THEM WRONG SIDE-UP TOM PRODUCED THREE LITTLE BOUQUETS ALL DIFFERENT IN COLOR SIZE AND CONSTRUCTION
IF YOU LL LEND ME YOUR SLED AND SIT IN MY LAP I LL TAKE YOU DOWN ALL NICE ANSWERED POLLY IN A CONFIDENTIAL TONE
NOW IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HER THAT MR SHAW DID N'T LIKE SUCH AMUSEMENTS AND HAD FORBIDDEN FAN TO INDULGE IN THEM
GIRLS SHOULD N'T HAVE SECRETS FROM THEIR FATHERS THEN THERE WOULD N'T BE ANY FUSS THOUGHT POLLY AS SHE WATCHED MR SHAW TWIST UP THE PINK NOTE AND POKE IT BACK AMONG THE FLOWERS WHICH HE TOOK FROM HER SAYING SHORTLY SEND FANNY TO ME IN THE LIBRARY NOW YOU VE DONE IT YOU STUPID THING CRIED FANNY BOTH ANGRY AND DISMAYED WHEN POLLY DELIVERED THE MESSAGE
IN THE TWILIGHT HE HAD A GOOD LOUNGE ON THE SOFA AND POLLY SUNG TO HIM WHICH ARRANGEMENT HE PARTICULARLY ENJOYED IT WAS SO COSY AND HOMEY AT NINE O'CLOCK POLLY PACKED HIS BAG WITH CLEAN CLOTHES NICELY MENDED SUCH REMNANTS OF THE FESTIVE TEA AS WERE TRANSPORTABLE AND KISSED HIM GOOD-NIGHT WITH MANY INJUNCTIONS TO MUFFLE UP HIS THROAT GOING OVER THE BRIDGE AND BE SURE THAT HIS FEET WERE DRY AND WARM WHEN HE WENT TO BED
BUT WE HAD OUR SCARE AND TESTED OUR COURAGE AND THAT WAS A GREAT SATISFACTION OF COURSE ANSWERED GRANDMA PLACIDLY
TOM WAS FULL OF SYMPATHY BUT DID N'T KNOW HOW TO SHOW IT
A CURIOUS SMILE PASSED OVER POLLY'S FACE AND SHE PUT UP HER GLASS TO HIDE HER EYES AS SHE SAID
BUT THERE WERE PLENTY OF TONGUES TO BLAME THAT EXTRAVAGANT DOG AND PLENTY OF HEADS TO WAG OMINOUSLY OVER PROPHECIES OF THE GOOD TIME TOM SHAW WOULD NOW MAKE ON THE ROAD TO RUIN
SOME THREE DAYS AFTER FAN'S JOYFUL CALL POLLY WAS STARTLED ON ENTERING THE SHAWS DOOR BY MAUD WHO CAME TUMBLING DOWN STAIRS SENDING AN AVALANCHE OF WORDS BEFORE HER HE S COME BEFORE HE SAID HE SHOULD TO SURPRISE US
MAUD BEING RELIEVED FROM THE FEAR OF BACK-DOOR BEGGARY SOON BECAME RECONCILED TO BANKRUPTCY
WHILE THEY WAITED TO GET OUT WHEN ALL WAS OVER POLLY HEARD FAN WHISPER TO TOM
YOU THOUGHT I WAS READING BUT I HEARD
GOOD PRACTICE MA'AM AS YOU LL FIND OUT SOME DAY ANSWERED POLLY LAUGHING SIGNIFICANTLY
NOW COME AND TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT SHE ADDED SITTING DOWN ON THE COUCH WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO HAS ESCAPED A GREAT PERIL
IN THE THIRD CHAMBER LAY SALLY AND WE TREMBLED AS THE OLD LADY WENT IN
I LL SHOW THEM THAT I AIN'T
IT S FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE BUT DISTRACTINGLY BECOMING AS YOU SHALL SEE
HUSH DON'T LAUGH CRIED SEVERAL VOICES AND WE SCUTTLED INTO BED AS RAPIDLY AND NOISELESSLY AS POSSIBLE WITH OUR MOUTHS AND HANDS FULL
A VERY HARMLESS LITTLE REVEL
IT EXALTETH UNDULY THE HUMBLE POWERS OF THE VICTIM
GRANDMA WILL ATTEND TO THINGS FOR MY POOR NERVES WON'T ALLOW ME TO COME DOWN WITH THAT MRS SHAW DISMISSED THEM AND THE FOUR DESCENDED TO RECEIVE THE FIRST BATCH OF VISITORS SEVERAL LITTLE GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN ASKED FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF KEEPING MAUD OUT OF HER SISTER'S WAY
BROTHERS AND SISTERS POLLY'S HAPPIEST DAY WAS SUNDAY FOR WILL NEVER FAILED TO SPEND IT WITH HER
NIPPED IN THE BUD ON THE EVENING OF FAN'S VISIT POLLY SAT DOWN BEFORE HER FIRE WITH A RESOLUTE AND THOUGHTFUL ASPECT
SHOULD N'T HAVE A CRIMP LEFT IF I WENT OUT SUCH A DAY AS THIS
SCRAPES CHAPTER 6
POLLY MOTIONED THE OTHERS TO BE QUIET AND NO ONE SPOKE TILL THE OLD LADY WITH A LONG SIGH CAME BACK TO THE PRESENT AND WENT ON
BELLE CAME AND TOLD ME IN TIME AND I JUST GOT PINK SO MY AMIABLE SISTER THAT IS TO BE WON'T SUCCEED IN HER PRETTY LITTLE PLOT I GUESS SHE HAS BEEN READING THE LIFE OF JOSEPHINE
REGULARLY FLOORED
ONLY DON'T SCREAM AND WAKE YOUR MOTHER
THEY HAD A MERRY LITTLE SUPPER AFTER THEY GOT HOME AND POLLY GAVE THEM A BURLESQUE OPERA THAT CONVULSED HER HEARERS FOR HER SPIRITS ROSE AGAIN AND SHE WAS DETERMINED TO GET THE LAST DROP OF FUN BEFORE SHE WENT BACK TO HER HUMDRUM LIFE AGAIN
HE WAS A SOCIAL FELLOW AND VERY GRATEFUL JUST THEN TO ANY ONE WHO HELPED HIM TO FORGET HIS WORRIES FOR A TIME
SO YOU LL ONLY SEE ABOUT A DOZEN AND THEY WILL BE SO BUSY THEY WON'T MIND YOU MUCH I GUESS I WON'T READ BUT SIT AND LOOK ON
HOW WELL HE GOT ON
I D WRITE AND TELL HER ALL THE WORRY ONLY IT WOULD N'T DO ANY GOOD AND WOULD ONLY TROUBLE HER
GOOD FOR YOU FAN AND TOM GAVE AN EMPHATIC NOD AS IF HER WORDS MEANT MORE THAN SHE SUSPECTED MIND YOU HE ADDED I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AND ONLY FANCIED THERE MIGHT BE SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION GOING ON
DID YOU WANT ME TOM YES
I LIKE IT BETTER THAN TALKING AT CROSS PURPOSES NOW MY DEAR DON'T BE ANGRY
WHAT DID YOU SAY I SAW SHE MEANT IT KINDLY SO I SAID I D ASK
SHE COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE FEELING
MY MAMMA SAYS IF I D BEEN GOING TO THAT SCHOOL SHE D HAVE TAKEN ME STRAIGHT AWAY ANSWERED ANOTHER GIRL WITH AN IMPORTANT AIR
MAY CAME AT LAST AND WITH IT A BURST OF SUNSHINE WHICH CHEERED EVEN POOR POLLY'S MUCH-ENDURING HEART
DO BANKRUPTING MEN MAUD LIKED THAT NEW WORD ALWAYS HAVE FITS MERCY NO
HE WATCHED HER A MINUTE AND THEN ASKED CURIOUSLY WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT JUST NOW WHEN YOU SAT STARING AT THE FIRE AND GETTING SOBERER AND SOBERER EVERY MINUTE
BUT YOU SEE TOM ALWAYS SEEMS SO LIKE A BOY AND YOU ARE MORE WOMANLY FOR YOUR AGE THAN ANY GIRL I KNOW SO I NEVER THOUGHT OF YOUR CARING FOR HIM IN THAT WAY
AND I MUST BE AMOOSED CAUSE I M FWACTIOUS
SO SHAW LET MILTON ALONE AND HE GOT ON VERY WELL IN HIS OWN WAY DOGGEDLY STICKING TO HIS BOOKS AND RESISTING ALL TEMPTATIONS BUT THOSE OF CERTAIN LIBRARIES ATHLETIC GAMES AND SUCH INEXPENSIVE PLEASURES AS WERE WITHIN HIS MEANS
GO TO PARTIES AS NEARLY LIKE THOSE OF GROWN PEOPLE AS IT S POSSIBLE TO MAKE THEM
I M GOING TO GET A PAIR AND SO MUST YOU DON'T THEY COST A GREAT DEAL EIGHT OR NINE DOLLARS I BELIEVE
RIP WENT THE POCKET OUT CAME THE HAND AND WITH A CRY OF PAIN FROM POLLY THE KEY FELL ON THE FLOOR
SEEMS TO ME POLLY DON'T COME HERE AS OFTEN AS SHE USED TO HE SAID PRESENTLY
WITH OUR COMBINED POCKET-MONEY SHE WAS TO BUY NUTS AND CANDY CAKE AND FRUIT PIE AND A CANDLE SO THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A LIGHT AFTER BETSEY TOOK OURS AWAY AS USUAL
WHAT A FATE FOR PRETTY POLLY EJACULATED TOM
BUT HIS TEMPER WAS UP AND HE WOULD N'T GIVE IN
THE MAN SAW IT TOO AND HAD HIM UP IN A MINUTE
TOM WITH HANDS IN HIS POCKETS ROCKED TO AND FRO MUTTERING RAPIDLY WHILE POLLY TWISTED THE LITTLE CURL ON HER FOREHEAD AND STARED AT THE WALL GABBLING WITH ALL HER MIGHT
MY MOTHER SAYS WE OUGHT TO BE KIND AND PATIENT AND RESPECTFUL TO ALL OLD FOLKS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE OLD AND I ALWAYS MEAN TO BE YOUR MOTHER S EVERLASTINGLY PREACHING MUTTERED FAN NETTLED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER OWN SHORTCOMINGS WITH REGARD TO GRANDMA
THERE S ONE THING YOU MUST HAVE AND THAT IS BRONZE BOOTS SAID FAN IMPRESSIVELY
A BARE ROOM COLD AS A BARN AND ON THE BED A LITTLE DEAD WHITE FACE THAT ALMOST BROKE MY HEART IT WAS SO THIN SO PATIENT AND SO YOUNG
AND WHEN THINGS TROUBLE YOU JUST LOOK AT YOUR TALISMAN AND I THINK THE SUNSHINE WILL COME BACK AGAIN OF COURSE IT DID FOR THE BEST OF ALL MAGIC WAS SHUT UP IN THE QUAINT LITTLE CASE THAT POLLY WORE INSIDE HER FROCK AND KISSED SO TENDERLY EACH NIGHT AND MORNING
SHE NEVER WENT FAR AND ALWAYS CAME BACK ROSY AND GAY
SHE ONLY FELT THAT SHE DID CARE FOR HIM VERY MUCH IN SPITE OF HIS FAULTS HIS INDIFFERENCE AND HIS ENGAGEMENT
BUT NOW SHE HAD SEEN IT IN A SHAPE WHICH SHE COULD FEEL AND UNDERSTAND AND LIFE GREW MORE EARNEST TO HER FROM THAT MINUTE
WITH THIS SATISFACTORY DECISION THE COUNCIL ENDED AFTER THE RATIFICATION OF A LOYAL LEAGUE BY WHICH THE FRIENDS PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO STAND STAUNCHLY BY ONE ANOTHER THROUGH THE TRIALS OF THE COMING YEAR
YOU OUGHT TO STUDY NOW AND PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU SAID POLLY WITH A LITTLE QUIVER OF THE LIPS
MR SHAW AND POLLY IN THE PARK
BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE IT IS WORSE AND TOM WALKED AWAY AGAIN WITH A DESPAIRING SORT OF GROAN
NOW COME UP AND HAVE ANOTHER SAID TOM HEARTILY
SALLY WAS IN HIGH FEATHER AT THE SUCCESS OF HER EXPLOIT AND DANCED ABOUT LIKE AN ELF AS SHE PUT HER NIGHT-GOWN ON OVER HER FROCK BRAIDED HER HAIR IN FUNNY LITTLE TAILS ALL OVER HER HEAD AND FASTENED THE GREAT RED PIN-CUSHION ON HER BOSOM FOR A BREAST-PIN IN HONOR OF THE FEAST
POLLY KNEW THIS FELT THAT HIS SOCIETY WOULD NOT BE A GREAT AFFLICTION TO HERSELF AT LEAST AND WHISPERING TO MAUD HE WON'T KNOW SHE ADDED ALOUD COME IN IF YOU LIKE AND STIR THIS CAKE FOR ME
SO COME UP AND GET READY SAID FANNY A DAY OR TWO AFTER AS SHE LEFT THE LATE BREAKFAST-TABLE
SHE DON'T ASK ALMS SHE ONLY WANTS EMPLOYMENT AND A LITTLE KINDNESS AND THE BEST CHARITY WE CAN BESTOW IS TO SEE THAT SHE HAS BOTH I LL GIVE HER AS MUCH SEWING AS SHE WANTS AND SHE CAN STAY AT OUR HOUSE WHILE SHE DOES IT IF SHE NEEDS A HOME SAID TRIX IN A SPASM OF BENEVOLENCE
BECAME ABSORBED IN THE CHAT OF HER OTHER NEIGHBORS
THERE S LOVE AND ROMANCE FOR YOU POLLY TOUCHED THE LITTLE RELIC TREASURED FOR A YEAR AND SMILED TO READ THE WORDS MY POLLY'S ROSE SCRIBBLED UNDER THE CRUMBLING LEAVES
EVEN HER SMALL HOUSEKEEPING LOST ITS CHARMS FOR POLLY WAS A SOCIAL CREATURE AND THE SOLITARY MEALS WERE OFTEN SAD ONES
TAKE A LOOK AT THEM AND YOU LL CHANGE YOUR MIND ANSWERED POLLY TAPPING AT A DOOR ON WHICH TWO MODEST CARDS WERE TACKED
SO NO WONDER SHE LONGED FOR SOMETHING MORE LIVELY THAN A DAILY PROMENADE WITH A FLOCK OF GIDDY GIRLS WHO TILTED ALONG IN HIGH-HEELED BOOTS AND COSTUMES WHICH MADE POLLY ASHAMED TO BE SEEN WITH SOME OF THEM
EVERY ONE OF YOU WRONG THOUGH PAPA COMES NEAREST THE TRUTH CRIED FANNY
SO S POLLY
I SHALL GROAN AND MOAN BY AND BY I DARE SAY BUT AT FIRST IT SORT OF DAZED ME AND NOW IT BEGINS TO EXCITE ME
YOU LL TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT BY AND BY WON'T YOU SHE WHISPERED PREPARING TO OBEY
MADAM NEVER COMPLAINED INTERFERED OR SUGGESTED
I DID N'T WANT TO TAKE YOU AWAY BEGAN POLLY SECRETLY HOPING THAT SHE DID N'T LOOK TOO PLEASED
DOWN CELLAR
WE WILL WORK UP TOGETHER MY BRAVE POLLY AND YOU SHALL YET BE PROUD OF YOUR HUSBAND THOUGH HE IS POOR TOM SHAW SHE WAS AS SURE OF THAT AS IF AN ORACLE HAD FORETOLD IT AND WAS NOT DECEIVED
AT TIMES SHE FANCIED HE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE BAD AGAIN AND THE NEXT THING SHE KNEW HE WAS DEEP IN MISCHIEF AND HOOTED AT THE IDEA OF REPENTANCE AND REFORMATION
BUT SOON THE MARTIAL RING OF THE LINES FIRED HIM AND BEFORE HE KNEW IT HE WAS ON HIS LEGS THUNDERING AWAY IN GRAND STYLE WHILE POLLY LISTENED WITH KINDLING FACE AND ABSORBED ATTENTION
SO YOU NEED N'T TRY TO CATCH ME UP AS GRANDMA DOES TOM I LL MAKE A BARGAIN WITH YOU CRIED FANNY EAGERLY
THAT GIVES HIS MOTHER TIME TO REST DOES BOTH THE CHILDREN GOOD AND KEEPS THINGS NEIGHBORLY
BUT TO-NIGHT AS I WENT UP LATE TO BED I WAS KIND OF IMPRESSED TO LOOK IN AND SEE HOW THE POOR THING DID FOR SHE HAD N'T LEFT HER ROOM ALL DAY
I M SURE I DON'T KNOW NOR CARE I SUPPOSE YOU HARD-HEARTED THING WHY FAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN I M NOT BLIND MY DEAR NEITHER IS TOM AND WHEN A YOUNG GENTLEMAN CUTS A CALL ABRUPTLY SHORT AND RACES AFTER A YOUNG LADY AND IS SEEN HOLDING HER HAND AT THE QUIETEST CORNER OF THE PARK AND THEN GOES TRAVELLING ALL OF A SUDDEN WE KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IF YOU DON'T WHO GOT UP THAT NICE IDEA I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW DEMANDED POLLY AS FANNY STOPPED FOR BREATH
ALCOTT PREFACE AS A PREFACE IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE AN AUTHOR CAN WITH PROPRIETY EXPLAIN A PURPOSE OR APOLOGIZE FOR SHORTCOMINGS I VENTURE TO AVAIL MYSELF OF THE PRIVILEGE TO MAKE A STATEMENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY READERS
NOW IF POLLY HAD N'T BEEN STUPID AS FAN SAID SHE WOULD HAVE HAD HER WITS ABOUT HER AND LET IT PASS
I TOLD TOM ABOUT THE BAD FELLOW WHO BLEW UP THE PROFESSOR AND HE SAID HE KNEW HIM SLIGHTLY
I PLAYED AT HOT COCKLES LAST NIGHT AT MY LORD OF LEICESTER'S
AND I VE BEEN PEGGING AWAY LIKE FURY FOR MOST SIX WEEKS AND HE DON'T DO A THING ABOUT IT
THE KINDLY PEOPLE PATRONIZED THE CARELESS FORGOT ALL ABOUT HER AND EVEN FANNY WITH ALL HER AFFECTION FELT THAT POLLY THE MUSIC TEACHER WOULD NOT BE WELCOME IN MANY PLACES WHERE POLLY THE YOUNG LADY HAD BEEN ACCEPTED AS MISS SHAW'S FRIEND SOME OF THE GIRLS STILL NODDED AMIABLY BUT NEVER INVITED HER TO VISIT THEM
HE TRAMPED HE BOBBED HE SKATED HE TWIRLED HER TO THE RIGHT DRAGGED HER TO THE LEFT BACKED HER UP AGAINST PEOPLE AND FURNITURE TROD ON HER FEET RUMPLED HER DRESS AND MADE A SPECTACLE OF HIMSELF GENERALLY
NOW I LL TELL YOU FOR BECKY WILL LET ME SINCE YOU HAVE PAID HER THE COMPLIMENT OF UNDERSTANDING HER WORK
FOR I HAVE SAID ALL SORTS OF THINGS ABOUT THE PEOPLE HERE AND IT IS N'T KIND
TOM HAD LIKEWISE BEEN PROPITIATED BY BEING ALLOWED TO BRING HIS THREE BOSOM FRIENDS WHO WENT BY THE SCHOOL-BOY NAMES OF RUMPLE SHERRY AND SPIDER
ONLY SOME LITTLE GIRLS AND TOM IT WAS HORRIDLY IMPROPER
AH YOU NEVER SEE HER AT HER BEST
AND HE D BE SO GLAD TO DO ANYTHING HE COULD
WELL YOU SEE I DON'T SEEM TO FIND ANYTHING TO DO UNLESS I TURN CLERK AND I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD SUIT
BUT IT DID NOT SEEM TO MAKE MUCH IMPRESSION UPON THEM THOUGH MONSIEUR WAS VERY READY TO EXPLAIN
I M GLAD YOU THINK SO ANYWAY
I ONLY WISH YOU COULD SEE MY NEW HAT AND GO WITH ME FOR LORD ROCKINGHAM PROMISED TO BE THERE
AND REMEMBER NOT TO DANCE TOO OFTEN FAN
IT WAS RATHER A HARD THING TO ASK OF A SHY SENSITIVE GIRL AND THE KIND OLD LADY KNEW IT FOR IN SPITE OF THE GRAY HAIR AND WITHERED FACE HER HEART WAS VERY YOUNG AND HER OWN GIRLISH TRIALS NOT FORGOTTEN
BLESS ME
IT WOULD BE HARD ON MOTHER AND THE GIRLS I SUPPOSE
A PALE PLAIN CHILD WITH SHARP INTELLIGENT EYES AND A BUSY LITTLE MIND THAT DID A GOOD DEAL MORE THINKING THAN ANYBODY IMAGINED
I WON'T BUT NOW I M NOT AFRAID TO TELL YOU THAT I THINK I HOPE I DO BELIEVE THAT SYDNEY CARES A LITTLE FOR ME
NOW YOU JUST SHOW ME ANY ONE YOU LIKE THE LOOKS OF AND I LL GET HIM FOR YOU NO MATTER WHO HE IS I DON'T WANT ANY OF THE GENTLEMEN
THEN IF IT S NOT HIM IT S SOME ONE ELSE
YOU KNOW I DON'T APPRECIATE A STYLISH COIFFURE AS I OUGHT SO I LIKE YOUR HAIR IN THE OLD WAY BEST
THIS MOURNFUL SPECTACLE SENT TOM'S PENITENT SPEECH STRAIGHT OUT OF HIS HEAD AND WITH AN ASTONISHED HULLO HE STOOD AND STARED IN IMPRESSIVE SILENCE
DO GO TO KATY
YOUNG ARTISTS TRYING TO PENCIL PAINT OR CARVE THEIR WAY TO ROME
WHO IS HERE KATY ONLY MR SYDNEY AND MASTER TOM
MAKE YOUR CANDY AND LET HIM ALONE OR I LL GO AND TELL PAPA AND THEN TOM WILL GET A LECTURE POLLY THOUGHT IT WAS N'T FAIR
SHE THANKS ME FOR ASKING HER HERE AS USUAL BUT SAYS SHE SHALL GO RIGHT TO WORK AND HAD BETTER BEGIN WITH HER OWN LITTLE ROOM AT ONCE
THEY ARE SO KIND IN ASKING ME AND I M NOT AFRAID OF THEM EXPLAINED POLLY PRANCING SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE COULD N'T KEEP STILL
TOM GOT HIS VELOCIPEDE NEXT DAY NAMED IT BLACK AUSTER IN MEMORY OF THE HORSE IN THE BATTLE OF LAKE REGILLUS AND CAME TO GRIEF AS SOON AS HE BEGAN TO RIDE HIS NEW STEED
SHE LOVED TO DO THE LITTLE THINGS THAT OTHERS DID NOT SEE OR WERE TOO BUSY TO STOP FOR
I HAVE N'T SEEN HER BUT ONCE SINCE SHE WAS MARRIED
BUT HE TRIED TO BE AND MOTHER SAYS THAT IS HALF THE BATTLE
SHE LIKES IT AND I M SURE I SHOULD THINK SHE WOULD
BUT IT S SO INCONVENIENT TO HAVE IT HAPPEN RIGHT HERE BECAUSE IT MAKES IT HARDER FOR US
WITHOUT LOOKING UP TOM ANSWERED IN A SMOTHERED VOICE FAILED
OF COURSE THERE WAS MUCH LAMENTATION AMONG THE WOMEN BUT EVERY ONE FELT IT WAS THE BEST THING FOR HIM
BEING POLITELY SUPPLIED WITH CARAMELS POLLY SAT LOOKING AND LISTENING FEELING VERY YOUNG AND COUNTRIFIED AMONG THESE ELEGANT YOUNG LADIES
WELL MY BROTHER DON'T WEAR A HORRID OLD CAP AND HE S GOT NICE HAIR
THIS ONE WAS TALL WITH A STRONG FACE KEEN EYES SHORT CURLY HAIR AND A FINE HEAD
MY HONORED FATHER
LET HIM THINK THE BOUQUET WAS FOR YOU
IT S HERSELF
JACK AND I LEFT OUR DOORS OPEN AND KEPT ASKING ONE ANOTHER IF WE DID N'T HEAR SOMETHING TILL HE FELL ASLEEP
OH WHAT FUN DON'T LAUGH AT HER OR DISCOURAGE HER
MR SHAW A BUSY-LOOKING GENTLEMAN SAID HOW DO YOU DO MY DEAR
WHEN FANNY ROSE AT LAST POLLY'S TIRED FACE REPROACHED HER
SINCE THEN POLLY HAD STORED SOME OF HER MOST PRIVATE TREASURES IN THE UPPER TRAY SO THAT SHE MIGHT FEEL SURE THEY WERE SAFE FROM ALL EYES
GRANDMA WAS SITTING BEFORE A QUAINT OLD CABINET THE DOORS OF WHICH STOOD WIDE OPEN SHOWING GLIMPSES OF THE FADED RELICS TREASURED THERE
I HATE TO HAVE HER MOPE SO BUT UPON MY LIFE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SAID TOM
POLLY LAUGHED WITH THE REST AT THE TIME
THE BLUE EYES WERE CLEAR AND STEADY THE FRESH MOUTH FRANK AND SWEET THE WHITE CHIN WAS A VERY FIRM ONE IN SPITE OF THE DIMPLE AND THE SMOOTH FOREHEAD UNDER THE LITTLE CURLS HAD A BROAD BENEVOLENT ARCH
I M ONE OF THEM AND I KNOW THE WORTH OF WHAT SHE DOES FOR ME
BUT AS THE FIRST ENCHANTMENT SUBSIDED POLLY BEGAN TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE TO BE SURE HER MOTHER WOULD N'T LIKE TO HAVE HER THERE AND TO WISH SHE HAD N'T COME
AND THE MINUTE FANNY SAW HER FATHER SHE DID KNOW WHAT TO DO
BUT MAUD CLAPPED HERS AND GAVE A JOYFUL BOUNCE AS SHE CRIED NOW I CAN LEARN TO COOK
YOU ARE TWICE AS STYLISH YET YOU NEVER LOOK LOUD OR FAST TOUCHED BY THIS UNUSUAL COMPLIMENT FANNY DREW HER CHAIR NEARER AS SHE REPLIED WITH COMPLACENCY YES I FLATTER MYSELF I DO KNOW HOW TO DRESS WELL
BLIND-MAN'S-BUFF WAS IN FULL SWING WHEN MR SHAW PEEPED IN AND SEEING POLLY FLYING ABOUT WITH BAND-AGED EYES JOINED IN THE FUN TO PUZZLE HER
THAT S NOT MY WAY EITHER SHE SAID DECIDEDLY
BUT WHEN FAN WAS FINISHED FROM TOP TO TOE SHE ADMIRED ALL SHE HONESTLY COULD AND TRIED TO KEEP HER THOUGHTS TO HERSELF
AM I DONE
DRAW UP THE BASKET AND THEN GET ME IN FOR I SAW MR COTTON IN THE MARKET AND RAN ALL THE WAY HOME SO THAT I MIGHT GET IN BEFORE HE CAME UP CAME THE HEAVY BASKET BUMPING AND SCRAPING ON THE WAY AND SMELLING O SO NICE
GRANDMA LOOKS TIRED
BUT AFTER THE FIRST SURPRISE PASSED HE SHOWED SUCH AN AFFECTIONATE SATISFACTION THAT SHE WAS BOTH TOUCHED AND FLATTERED
I CAN'T DO BOTH AND I M NOT GOING TO TRY BUT I CAN PICK UP BITS OF FUN AS I GO ALONG AND BE CONTENTED WITH FREE CONCERTS AND LECTURES SEEING YOU PRETTY OFTEN AND EVERY SUNDAY WILL IS TO SPEND WITH ME SO I SHALL HAVE QUITE AS MUCH DISSIPATION AS IS GOOD FOR ME IF YOU DON'T COME TO MY PARTIES I LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU SAID FANNY AS POLLY PAUSED WHILE TOM CHUCKLED INWARDLY AT THE IDEA OF CALLING VISITS FROM A BROTHER DISSIPATION ANY SMALL PARTY WHERE IT WILL DO TO WEAR A PLAIN BLACK SILK I CAN COME TO
IF THE LADDER WAS N'T TOO HEAVY WE COULD TRY THAT SAID I DETERMINED TO HAVE THEM
BUT I WON'T ROUSE THE HOUSE TILL THE BELL RINGS OR THE PANS FALL
BOTH OF US IN A SCRAPE AT ONCE DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING ASKED FANNY AFTER PLAYING A BAR OR TWO VERY BADLY
FANNY NEVER WOULD FORGIVE US IF YOU SHOWED HER CURLS AND THINGS TO THOSE PEOPLE
I DARE SAY SHE LL KNOW YOU THOUGH I M NOT THERE BECAUSE I VE DESCRIBED YOU TO HER GUESS SHE WON'T THEN AND TOM GAVE A HASTY SMOOTH TO HIS CURLY PATE AND A GLANCE AT THE MIRROR FEELING SURE THAT HIS SISTER HAD N'T DONE HIM JUSTICE
I DON'T ASK YOU TO GO AND MAKE SPEECHES ONLY A FEW HAVE THE GIFT FOR THAT BUT I DO WANT EVERY GIRL AND WOMAN TO FEEL THIS DUTY AND MAKE ANY LITTLE SACRIFICE OF TIME OR FEELING THAT MAY BE ASKED OF THEM BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO AND NO ONE CAN DO IT AS WELL AS OURSELVES IF WE ONLY THINK SO I LL TRY SAID POLLY INFLUENCED MORE BY HER DESIRE TO KEEP MISS MILLS GOOD OPINION THAN ANY LOVE OF SELF-SACRIFICE FOR HER SEX
O MY DEAR I MUST NOT FORGET TO TELL YOU THE GREAT EVENT OF MY FIRST SEASON
THERE ARE GOOD AND LOVELY THINGS AMONG THEM IF ONE ONLY HAS EYES TO SEE THEM
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS PERFORMANCE ASKED TOM WHEELING ROUND TO POLLY WHO STILL SAT BY MRS SHAW IN THE SHADOW OF THE BED-CURTAINS
WHERE ARE YOUR TRUNKS ASKED TOM AS HE WAS REMINDED OF HIS DUTY BY HER HANDING HIM THE BAG WHICH HE HAD NOT OFFERED TO TAKE
BESS GAVE FAN THE ONE EASY-CHAIR
ON THE COUCH LOUNGED WILL HIS THOUGHTFUL EYES FIXED ON POLLY WHO WHILE SHE TALKED SMOOTHED THE BROAD FOREHEAD OF HER YELLOW-HAIRED LADDIE IN A WAY THAT TOM THOUGHT AN IMMENSE IMPROVEMENT ON MAUD'S PERFORMANCE
AND OH
I AM TO WEAR WHITE SATIN AND PLUMES PEARLS AND ROSES
NOW AND THEN WHEN ANY ONE SAID TRIX WOULD N'T JILT TOM OR THAT TOM DID CARE FOR TRIX MORE THAN HE SHOULD POLLY HAD A PANG AND THOUGHT SHE COULD N'T POSSIBLY BEAR IT
I WISH YOU COULD HAVE HEARD MY PAPA GO ON
THE LIGHT OF A BRIGHT FIRE FILLED THE LITTLE ROOM AND DOWN ON A STOOL BEFORE IT WAS MAUD TENDING PUTTEL AND WATCHING WITH DEEP INTEREST THE ROASTING OF AN APPLE INTENDED FOR HER SPECIAL BENEFIT
I LL KEEP STILL BUT IF ANYBODY MUST HOLD ME LET POLLY
FEELING ALL THE TIME HOW ILL-FITTED HE WAS FOR SUCH A TASK
UNFORTUNATELY MRS SHAW WAS OUT DRIVING WITH GRANDMA AND FANNY WAS MAKING CALLS
DON'T KNOW HOW
IN DOING SO TOM CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HER FACE AND SAID HASTILY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLAN NO I DON'T WHY NOT
TAKE THE SARDINES BY THEIR LITTLE TAILS AND WIPE YOUR FINGERS ON MY BROWN-PAPER NAPKINS SAID KATE SETTING THE EXAMPLE WITH SUCH A RELISH THAT THE OTHERS FOLLOWED IT IN A GALE OF MERRIMENT
AS SHE WATCHED THEM WHILE THEY SLOWLY APPROACHED LOOKING SO GAY AND HANDSOME AND HAPPY IT SEEMED TO POLLY AS IF ALL THE SUNSHINE AND GOOD WALKING WAS ON THEIR SIDE OF THE STREET ALL THE WINTRY WIND AND MUD ON HERS
YOU DON'T LOOK A BIT NATURAL
THE GATE IS N'T LOCKED AND SOME BEGGAR HAS STOLEN IT
POLLY FLEW UP LOOKING SO PLEASED AND SURPRISED THAT TOM REPROACHED HIMSELF FOR NOT HAVING CALLED OFTENER
THE LITTLE ROOM WILL COST SOMETHING AND SHE CAN STAY WITH US JUST AS WELL AS NOT EVEN IF SHE DOES TEACH
YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF
THAT S A MODEL SERMON POLLY SHORT SWEET SENSIBLE AND NOT A BIT SLEEPY
WE LL HAVE IT OUT OF HIM WHEN HE COMES HOME IN THE SPRING SAID FANNY TO POLLY AS THEY COMPARED THE LETTERS OF THEIR BROTHERS AND AGREED THAT MEN WERE THE MOST UNCOMMUNICATIVE AND PROVOKING ANIMALS UNDER THE SUN FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS
I WISH THE OTHER TROUBLE COULD BE CURED AS EASILY AS THIS HERE PUSS SHOWED AN AMIABLE DESIRE TO FORGIVE AND FORGET AND POLLY TOOK HER UP SAYING ALOUD
HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING BUT NOTHING SEEMED TO APPEAR
I CHOOSE THIS SAID POLLY HOLDING UP A LONG WHITE KID GLOVE SHRUNKEN AND YELLOW WITH TIME BUT LOOKING AS IF IT HAD A HISTORY
HE S YOUR BROTHER IS N'T HE YES
AND HER MANNER WAS SO KIND SO COMFORTABLE THAT FANNY FELT ITS SILENT MAGIC GREW MORE CHEERFUL IN THE QUIET ATMOSPHERE OF THAT LITTLE ROOM AND WHEN THEY SAID GOOD-NIGHT AFTER AN OLD-TIME GOSSIP BY THE FIRE SHE KISSED HER HOSTESS WARMLY SAYING WITH A GRATEFUL LOOK POLLY DEAR I SHALL COME OFTEN YOU DO ME SO MUCH GOOD CHAPTER IX
IT IS A WELL-KNOWN FACT THAT DRESS PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT PART IN THE LIVES OF MOST WOMEN AND EVEN THE MOST SENSIBLE CANNOT HELP OWNING SOMETIMES HOW MUCH HAPPINESS THEY OWE TO A BECOMING GOWN GRACEFULLY ARRANGED HAIR OR A BONNET WHICH BRINGS OUT THE BEST POINTS IN THEIR FACES AND PUTS THEM IN A GOOD HUMOR
SHE HAD BEEN MUCH AMAZED ONLY THE DAY BEFORE TO HEAR MAUD SAY TO HER MOTHER MAMMA MUST I HAVE A BEAU
YOU OUGHT NOT TO PUT THEM AWAY TORN AND SOILED MY CHILD
SYDNEY AT THE SAME MOMENT WAS WISHING HE WAS IN TOM'S PLACE YOUNG COMELY AND SUCH A FAMILIAR FRIEND THAT POLLY WOULD SCOLD AND LECTURE HIM IN THE DELIGHTFUL WAY SHE DID TOM
BUT TO ME IT IS ONLY A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN BIGGER LOVELIER AND MORE IMPOSING THAN ANY WOMAN I EVER SAW ANSWERED FANNY SLOWLY TRYING TO EXPRESS THE IMPRESSION THE STATUE MADE UPON HER
I SHOULD THINK YOU D BE ASHAMED OF IT
NO HE DID N'T
HE IS AS BLIND AS A BAT BUT RECOGNIZED THE DRESS AND PULLED OFF HIS HAT TO IT IN THE MOST ELEGANT STYLE
WHY THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A HUMDRUM UNROMANTIC THING AS I AM CRIED POLLY AMAZED
IS TRIX SICK ASKED POLLY
WHO GIVES THE FRIENDSHIP LESSONS SUCH PLEASANT GIRLS
AND IT S PROPER FOR YOU NEVER KNOW WHO YOU MAY MEET
THAT NIGHT WE PUT A TUB OF WATER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BACK-STAIRS AND A PILE OF TIN PANS AT THE TOP OF THE FRONT STAIRS SO THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO COME UP WOULD PRODUCE A SPLASH OR A RATTLE
BUT BEFORE LASTING HARM WAS DONE SHE RECEIVED FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE SOME OF THE REAL HELP WHICH TEACHES YOUNG PEOPLE HOW TO BEAR THESE SMALL CROSSES BY SHOWING THEM THE HEAVIER ONES THEY HAVE ESCAPED AND BY GIVING THEM AN IDEA OF THE HIGHER PLEASURES ONE MAY EARN IN THE GOOD OLD-FASHIONED WAYS THAT KEEP HEARTS SWEET HEADS SANE HANDS BUSY
AND HOW LONG THE LIST GREW WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING TO BUY THE ARTICLES
AND SO ANXIOUS TO BE GOOD THAT HE KEPT ON TRYING TILL HE WAS BETTER EVEN THAN POLLY WHOM TOM PRIVATELY CONSIDERED A MODEL OF VIRTUE AS GIRLS GO
AND I SHALL BE IF I TRY TO MAKE THE GIRLS THINK SOBERLY ABOUT ANYTHING SENSIBLE OR PHILANTHROPIC
MOTHER AND AUNT WERE VERY TIMID AND THE CHILDREN WEREN'T OLD ENOUGH TO BE OF ANY USE SO JACK AND I WERE THE HOME-GUARD AND VOWED TO DEFEND THE FAMILY MANFULLY GOOD FOR YOU
IT S EXPENSIVE I KNOW BUT IT S REMARKABLY GOOD AND MUSIC IS SUCH A TREAT TO ME
THEY WERE VERY GOOD FRIENDS BUT LED ENTIRELY DIFFERENT LIVES WILL BEING A DIG AND TOM A BIRD OR IN PLAIN ENGLISH ONE WAS A HARD STUDENT AND THE OTHER A JOLLY YOUNG GENTLEMAN
COLLEGE SCRAPES WERE SOON FORGOTTEN IN GREATER AFFLICTIONS
YOUR BROTHER IS A PIG YOU RE A FIB SO ARE YOU HERE I REGRET TO SAY MISS SHAW SLAPPED MISS LOVETT WHO PROMPTLY RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT AND BOTH BEGAN TO CRY
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TELL THE GIRLS ABOUT TRIX AND SYDNEY SHE ASKED AS SHE ROSE FEELING THAT THE COUNCIL WAS OVER
IT TAKES ALL MY LEISURE TIME TO MEND MY GLOVES AND REFRESH MY DRESSES ANSWERED BELLE
TRIX ONLY WAITED TO SEE HOW BAD THINGS REALLY WERE OR RATHER HER MOTHER DID
SOME ONE HINTED AS MUCH TO ME BUT YOU LOOKED SO WELL I COULD N'T BELIEVE IT NOW THAT WAS CRUEL IN TRIX MORE CRUEL THAN ANY ONE GUESSED
SO SHE CAME UP TO THE SOFA WHERE HE LAY AND NODDED REASSURINGLY AS SHE PUT A SOFT LITTLE HAND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE DAMAGED HEAD
POLLY S ALWAYS POKING UP IN GRANDMA'S ROOM
POLLY FELT OUT OF TUNE HERSELF AND ALL THE PIANOS SEEMED TO NEED A TUNER AS MUCH AS SHE DID
FATHER TOLD ME NOT TO WAIT FOR ANY ONE ELSE I D LOSE MY CHANCE OF A HACK
SHE MIGHT HAVE CHANGED HER MIND HOWEVER IF SHE HAD FOLLOWED HIM FOR AS SOON AS HE TURNED THE CORNER HIS WHOLE ASPECT ALTERED
NOW TAKE OFF YOUR THINGS AND LET ME DO THE HONORS FOR YOU ARE TO STOP TO TEA AND THE CARRIAGE IS TO COME FOR YOU AT EIGHT
YOU RE AFRAID OF WHAT FOLKS WILL SAY
IN IT POLLY SAW A PAIR OF TELLTALE EYES LOOKING OUT FROM A TANGLE OF BRIGHT BROWN HAIR CHEEKS THAT FLUSHED AND DIMPLED SUDDENLY AS THE FRESH MOUTH SMILED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONSCIOUS POWER HALF PROUD HALF ASHAMED AND AS PRETTY TO SEE AS THE COQUETTISH GESTURE WITH WHICH SHE SMOOTHED BACK HER CURLS AND FLOURISHED A WHITE HAND
NOW RUMPLE YOU GO AND CARRY OFF A BASKET OF CAKE AND I LL WATCH HERE TILL KATY COMES BY WITH A FRESH LOT OF OYSTERS
WHEN HE REACHED THE PLAY-ROOM POLLY WAS SITTING IN THE SWING SAYING VERY EARNESTLY I ALWAYS TOLD YOU IT WAS NICE UP IN GRANDMA'S ROOM AND NOW YOU SEE IT IS
IT S NO USE TO DENY IT FOR YOU VE GOT THE LOOK I USED TO SEE IN THAT VERY GLASS ON MY OWN FACE WHEN I THOUGHT HE CARED FOR YOU
I CAN'T DO IT FOR I M ONLY A CURSE INSTEAD OF A COMFORT TO HIM HOW DID HE TAKE YOUR NEWS ASKED POLLY WHO FOR A TIME HAD FORGOTTEN THE LESSER TROUBLE IN THE GREATER
JUST ONE PEEP ANSWERED FANNY
DON'T LOOK SO FRIGHTENED MAUDIE BUT COME INTO THE PARLOR AND SEE WHAT I VE GOT FOR YOU SAID POLLY FEELING THAT THERE WAS TROUBLE OF SOME SORT IN THE AIR BUT TRYING TO CHEER THE CHILD FOR HER LITTLE FACE WAS FULL OF A SORROWFUL ANXIETY THAT WENT TO POLLY'S HEART
IT WAS ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO CUT PRAYERS AND GOT A PRIVATE AND HAD DONE ALL SORTS OF BAD THINGS AND HAD ONE OR TWO PUBLICS
I HAVE IT
AND THEN BELLE SAID IN HER BLUNT WAY I LL GIVE FAN ALL SHE PAID FOR IT AND MORE TOO IF IT WILL BE ANY HELP TO HER
SURE NOW OF MY PREY I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SCREAM JACK WHEN SOMETHING WENT SPLASH INTO THE TUB AT THE FOOT OF THE BACK-STAIRS
FANNY PLAYED AND READ ALOUD
VERY PROUD HE WAS TO BE SURE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO LOAD THAT PISTOL AND KEEP IT BY HIS BED IN OUR GREAT WORRIMENT FOR WE FEARED HE D KILL HIMSELF WITH IT
THE SWEET OLD TUNES THAT ONE IS NEVER TIRED OF WERE ALL POLLY'S STORE
I VE SOMETIMES THOUGHT YOU DID N'T QUITE APPRECIATE YOUR FATHER ANY MORE THAN HE KNEW HOW MUCH OF A MAN YOU WERE NEVER WAS TILL TO-DAY YOU KNOW SAID TOM LAUGHING YET LOOKING AS IF HE FELT THE DIGNITY OF HIS ONE AND TWENTY YEARS
THE SAINTS BE ABOUT US
SOMEBODY'S HAIR ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD IN THE PLACE WHERE IT OUGHT NOT TO BE AND TOM WENT WHISTLING AWAY WITH AN AIR OF SUBLIME INDIFFERENCE AS TO THE STATE OF HIS OWN CURLY POW WHY MUST YOU BE SO FINE TO GO TO SCHOOL ASKED POLLY WATCHING FAN ARRANGE THE LITTLE FRIZZLES ON HER FOREHEAD AND SETTLE THE VARIOUS STREAMERS AND FESTOONS BELONGING TO HER DRESS
AND HOW COULD I HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY A WORD WHEN I HAD NOTHING ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH TO OFFER YOU BUT MY WORTHLESS SELF ANSWERED TOM WARMLY
LOOK STRAIGHT BEFORE YOU AND YOU LL SEE IT POLLY DID LOOK BUT ALL SHE SAW WAS HER OWN FACE IN THE LITTLE MIRROR OF THE FAN WHICH TOM HELD UP AND PEEPED OVER WITH A LAUGH IN HIS EYES
THE SILENCE NEVER LASTS LONG HOWEVER FOR THE FEMININE DESIRE TO TALK IT OVER USUALLY GETS THE BETTER OF THE DEEPEST EMOTION
BUT I MET TOM AND WE CAME HOME TOGETHER POLLY'S EYES TWINKLED WHEN SHE SAID THAT AND TOM CHOKED IN HIS SOUP
EACH PAYS WHAT THEY CAN
HALF-WAY UP THE SECOND FLIGHT THEY ALL STOPPED AS SUDDENLY AS IF THEY HAD SEEN A GHOST
SO IF YOU TRY IT AGAIN IT S ALL UP WITH YOU MISS SAID TOM FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST THE PLEASURE OF TYRANNIZING A LITTLE WHEN HE GOT THE CHANCE
BUT A MILD SNORE FROM THE OTHER ROOM SEEMED TO ASSURE HER THAT IT WAS A WASTE OF SHOT TO FIRE IN THAT DIRECTION
IT WAS YEARS AGO BEGAN GRANDMA BRISKLY AND TEACHERS WERE VERY MUCH STRICTER THAN THEY ARE NOW
SHE LEANED BACK AS IF QUITE OPPRESSED BY THE HEAT PERMITTED SYDNEY TO FAN HER AND PAID HIM FOR THE SERVICE BY GIVING HIM A FLOWER FROM HER BOUQUET PROCEEDINGS WHICH AMUSED TOM IMMENSELY EVEN WHILE IT PIQUED HIM A LITTLE TO BE TREATED LIKE AN OLD FRIEND WHO DID N'T COUNT
BUT YOU ARE IN SOME WAYS WISH I WAS
NOBODY IS UP TO SPOIL MY QUIET TIME AND I MUST WRITE MY JOURNAL FOR I VE BEEN SO BAD LATELY I COULD N'T BEAR TO DO IT
WE LIGHTED THE CANDLE AGAIN AND RETURNED TO OUR REVEL
I NEVER TELL TALES AND POLLY KEPT HER WORD FEELING SURE FAN DID N'T MEAN TO DECEIVE HER FATHER SINCE SHE TOLD HER MOTHER EVERYTHING
NOW YOU VE DONE IT CRIED SALLY AS MARY SCRATCHED LIKE A MAD RAT AND A DOOR CREAKED BELOW FOR MISS COTTON WAS NOT DEAF
MUCH BETTER AND CHEAPER THAN WE HAVE NOW RETURNED GRANDMA READY TO DEFEND THE GOOD OLD TIMES AGAINST EVERY INSINUATION
AND POLLY APPRECIATES HER BROTHERS DON'T FORGET TO ADD THAT MA'AM ANSWERED TOM
WHAT CAN I DO SIR ASKED POLLY LOOKING READY BUT QUITE IGNORANT HOW TO BEGIN
FAN'S GOT THE BOOKS AND MAPS YOU WANTED
DOLLIES ARE SAFE COMPANIONS AND NEEDLEWORK AN ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT S SADLY NEGLECTED NOWADAYS
LAFAYETTE BOWED FIRST TO THE GOVERNOR'S PICTURE THEN TO THE GOVERNOR'S WIDOW AND KISSED HER HAND
A WELL-CONDUCTED BOY WOULD HAVE LET THINGS ALONE OR A MORAL BROTHER WOULD HAVE PUT THINGS TO RIGHTS
AND THOUGH SHE IS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT POLITENESS I DON'T THINK IT IS POLITE TO TREAT COMPANY AS SHE DOES ME
MAUD HAD A GENIUS FOR COOKING AND FANNY HATED IT SO THAT LITTLE PERSON WAS IN HER GLORY STUDYING RECEIPT BOOKS AND TAKING LESSONS WHENEVER POLLY COULD GIVE THEM
IT WOULD BE DREADFUL NAUGHTY BEGAN NELLY BUT I GUESS WE WILL SHE ADDED AS THE SWEET MOUTHFUL SLIPPED DOWN HER THROAT
PUT IN LOTS WON'T YOU
SHE LL THINK YOU CARED MORE ABOUT YOUR FRIZZLES THAN YOUR FRIENDS AND SHE LL BE ABOUT RIGHT TOO FEELING THAT HE SAID RATHER A NEAT AND CUTTING THING TOM SAUNTERED LEISURELY AWAY PERFECTLY CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS LATE BUT BENT ON NOT BEING HURRIED WHILE IN SIGHT THOUGH HE RAN HIMSELF OFF HIS LEGS TO MAKE UP FOR IT AFTERWARD
THE INSTANT IT WAS OVER POLLY RUSHED AWAY AND BOUGHT NOT ONLY THE KIDS BUT A BONNET FRAME A BIT OF ILLUSION AND A PINK CRAPE ROSE WHICH HAD TEMPTED HER FOR WEEKS IN A CERTAIN SHOP WINDOW THEN HOME AND TO WORK WITH ALL THE SKILL AND SPEED OF A DISTRACTED MILLINER
WHY IT IS KATE KING THE AUTHORESS
WHY SHOULD I ANSWERED POLLY STOUTLY
DO I POLLY NOT IN THE SAME WAY TOM SHE ANSWERED IN A TONE THAT DID N'T SOUND QUITE NATURAL
I SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL BUT I WAS N'T SORRY AFTERWARD FOR I LEARNED TO LOVE AUNT BETSEY WHO NURSED ME TENDERLY AND SEEMED TO FORGET HER STRICT WAYS IN HER ANXIETY FOR ME
THE GIRLS GET THEIR DUDS BECAUSE THEY TEASE
I AM TO BE PRESENTED AT THE NEXT DRAWING ROOM
BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU I CAN'T SELL MYSELF FOR AN ESTABLISHMENT MERCY
SHE FUSSES ALL DAY LONG BEGAN FANNY
HE MEANS TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING
SUCH FUNNY BUNDLES AS WE USED TO HAVE SOMETIMES ODD SHOES BONNETS WITHOUT CROWNS STOCKINGS WITHOUT HEELS OR TOES AND OLD FINERY OF ALL SORTS
IT MAKES HIM FEEL GOOD HE SAYS SAID MAUD WHO HAD A TALENT FOR BETRAYING TRIFLES WHICH PEOPLE PREFERRED SHOULD NOT BE MENTIONED IN PUBLIC
PERHAPS SAID POLLY AS HER HEART FLUTTERED AND THEN SUNK FOR THIS WAS A CASE WHERE SHE COULD DO NOTHING BUT HOPE AND KEEP HER HANDS BUSY WITH WILL'S NEW SET OF SHIRTS
THAT HER OWN HAPPY SPIRITS GAVE THE CROWNING CHARM TO A PICTURE WHICH EVERY ONE LIKED TO SEE A BLITHE YOUNG GIRL ENJOYING HERSELF WITH ALL HER HEART
IT WAS GREAT FUN I DO ASSURE YOU POLLY HAD RUN ON IN HER LIVELY WAY NOT BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT HER ADVENTURES AMOUNTED TO MUCH BUT FROM A WISH TO CHEER UP HER FRIENDS WHO HAD STRUCK HER AS LOOKING RATHER DULL AND OUT OF SORTS ESPECIALLY MR SHAW
THAT S HER HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE PRESENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF A GIRL IN GORGEOUS ARRAY STANDING WITH HER HANDS FOLDED AND A VERY SMALL HAT PERCHED ON THE TOP OF A VERY LARGE CHIG-NON AS TOM PRONOUNCED IT
TAKE EM OFF TOM AND I LL PLAY ANYTHING ELSE YOU LIKE I AIN'T GOING TO DRESS UP FOR NOTHING
LITTLE THINGS IT S SO WAINY I CAN'T GO OUT AND EVWYBODY IS SO CWOSS THEY WON'T PLAY WITH ME SAID MAUD WHEN POLLY FOUND HER FRETTING ON THE STAIRS AND PAUSED TO ASK THE CAUSE OF HER WAILS
I M NOT A RAMPANT WOMAN'S RIGHTS REFORMER ADDED MISS MILLS WITH A SMILE AT POLLY'S SOBER FACE
AND THE GIRLS WAITED ON HIM LIKE DEVOTED SLAVES
THE WOMAN WHO DID NOT DARE CHAPTER 19
I FORBID IT AND SHE LEFT OF COURSE WHICH MADE PAPA SO CROSS HE WOULD N'T GIVE ME THE CAMEL'S HAIR SHAWL HE PROMISED THIS YEAR IT S PERFECTLY SHAMEFUL SAID MISS PERKINS AS TRIX PAUSED OUT OF BREATH
HE LOOKED AT HER STEADILY FOR A MINUTE BUT SAW ONLY A ROSY EAR AND A BENT HEAD
WHY IT S ALL FULL OF SHELLS EXCLAIMED MAUD PEERING INTO THE PAN
WILL YOU GIVE ME THAT KEY NO I WON'T SAID POLLY VALIANTLY
YES BY THE TIME THE LITTLE TEAKETTLE HAD LOST ITS BRIGHTNESS POLLY HAD DECIDED THAT GETTING ONE'S LIVING WAS NO JOKE AND MANY OF HER BRILLIANT HOPES HAD SHARED THE FATE OF THE LITTLE KETTLE
WE HAVE SUCH NICE TIMES AND WILL IS THERE AND WE BAKE LITTLE JOHNNY-CAKES IN THE BAKER BEFORE THE FIRE AND THEY SING AND IT IS SO PLEASANT WARBLING JOHNNY-CAKES MUST BE INTERESTING
FOR OUR SMALL SPECTATOR WAS BEING RAPIDLY ENLIGHTENED BY THE GOSSIP GOING ON ALL ABOUT HER AS WELL AS BY HER OWN QUICK EYES AND GIRLISH INSTINCTS
THE FIRST VISIT OF LAFAYETTE WAS BEFORE MY TIME OF COURSE BUT I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT IT FROM MY GRANDFATHER THAT I REALLY FELT AS IF I D SEEN IT ALL
MY WOMAN IS TO STAND ALONE AND HELP HERSELF SAID REBECCA DECIDEDLY
BUT FANNY FELT INJURED AND WOULD N'T SHOW THAT SHE WAS SORRY SO SHE ONLY SAID PETTISHLY I SUPPOSE I CAN HAVE MY FLOWERS NOW THE FUSS IS OVER THEY ARE GOING STRAIGHT BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM WITH A LINE FROM ME WHICH WILL KEEP THAT PUPPY FROM EVER SENDING YOU ANY MORE RINGING THE BELL MR SHAW DESPATCHED THE UNFORTUNATE POSY AND THEN TURNED TO POLLY SAYING KINDLY BUT GRAVELY SET THIS SILLY CHILD OF MINE A GOOD EXAMPLE AND DO YOUR BEST FOR HER WON'T YOU ME
WHAT'S THE SECRET POLLY AND FAN LOOKED UP WITH WET EYES AND A WISTFUL FACE AT POLLY WHO WAS PUTTING LITTLE DABS OF COLOGNE ALL OVER HER HEAD
ONLY ME DEAR ANSWERED GRANDMA'S MILD VOICE
YOU JUST SIT STILL AND I LL GET YOU HOME IN A JIFFY AND BEFORE SHE COULD UNPACK HERSELF TOM TROTTED OFF WITH HER AT A FINE PACE
NEW FASHIONS I M GOING TO SCHOOL THIS MORNING
NOW MAUD BRING ON THE CITRON AND POLLY BEGAN TO PUT THE CAKE TOGETHER IN WHAT SEEMED A MOST CARELESS AND CHAOTIC MANNER WHILE TOM AND MAUD WATCHED WITH ABSORBING INTEREST TILL IT WAS SAFELY IN THE OVEN
AND THOUGH SHE DID N'T KNOW THAT SHE HAD MADE THE SUNSHINE IT SHONE BACK UPON HER SO PLEASANTLY THAT SHE FELL HAPPILY ASLEEP THOUGH HER JIMMY WAS N'T THERE TO SAY GOOD-NIGHT CHAPTER V
POLLY CAME AND WENT THROUGH ALL THESE CHANGES FAITHFUL HELPFUL AND AS CHEERY AS SHE COULD BE WHEN HER FRIENDS WERE IN TROUBLE
FOR I BEHAVE EVER SO MUCH BETTER THAN SOME OF THE GIRLS
JUST ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT DOES EVERYBODY HEAPS OF GOOD IT IS SO GENEROUS AND SO DESERVED
I DON'T CARE ANSWERED FAN LOOKING BOTH ANGRY AND ASHAMED AS SHE STOOD SULLENLY TYING KNOTS IN HER HANDKERCHIEF
MAUD WENT TO PEEP OVER THE BANISTERS AND CAME FLYING BACK IN A RAPTURE
YES I AM ANSWERED POLLY SOBERLY
THE SUNNY SIDE I VE WON THE WAGER TOM DID N'T KNOW THERE WAS ONE DON'T YOU REMEMBER YOU SAID POLLY WOULD BE TIRED OF HER TEACHING AND GIVE IT UP IN THREE MONTHS AND I SAID SHE WOULD N'T WELL IS N'T SHE NOT A BIT OF IT
HERE S NUTS A POT OF JAM AND SOME CAKE
SHE FOUND FANNY ENDURING TORMENT UNDER THE HANDS OF THE HAIR-DRESSER WHO WAS DOING HIS BEST TO SPOIL HER HAIR AND DISTORT HER HEAD WITH A MASS OF CURLS BRAIDS FRIZZLES AND PUFFS
AND THAT IS THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE I THINK AS POLLY PAUSED SEVERAL KEEN EYES DISCOVERED THAT EMMA'S CHEEKS WERE VERY RED AND SAW A SMILE LURKING IN THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH THAT TRIED TO LOOK DEMURE WHICH TOLD THEM WHO POLLY MEANT
AND IF I DID I SHOULD N'T ASK A GIRL TO HELP ME OUT WHY NOT
DO YOU THINK IT WAS VERY DREADFUL OF ME ASKED POLLY LOOKING AT HIM
IT S NO MATTER ABOUT THE CANDY
THEY ARE FOR FAN
I SOMETIMES THINK I AIN'T GOOD FOR MUCH AND THAT SEEMS TO ME THE REASON WHY I SHOULD N'T EVEN TRY TO BE A MINISTER SAID WILL SMILING YET LOOKING AS IF WITH ALL HIS HUMILITY HE DID HAVE FAITH IN THE ASPIRATIONS THAT CAME TO HIM IN HIS BEST MOMENTS
DO HAVE TOAST FOR TEA POLLY AND LET ME MAKE IT WITH THE NEW TOASTING FORK
WELL I CAN'T DO ANYTHING BUT WAIT SHE SAID AT LAST SLAMMING THE MUSIC-BOOK TOGETHER WITH A DESPERATE LOOK
SO WEAR THE PLAIN FROCKS MOTHER TOOK SUCH PLEASURE IN MAKING FOR YOU AND LET THE PANNIERS GO
IN THE MOVING NOTHING SUITED HER BETTER THAN TO TROT UP AND DOWN LUGGING HEAVY THINGS TO POUND HER FINGERS BLACK AND BLUE NAILING CARPETS AND CURTAINS AND THE DAY SHE NEARLY BROKE HER NECK TUMBLING DOWN THE CELLAR STAIRS IN HER EAGERNESS TO SEE THAT MRS SHAW'S WINE WAS RIGHTLY STORED SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS ONLY PAYING HER DEBTS AND TOLD TOM SHE LIKED IT WHEN HE PICKED HER UP LOOKING AS GRIMY AS A CHIMNEY-SWEEP
FOR WHEN NEGLECTED TOM GOT OVER HIS FIRST AMAZEMENT AT THIS CHANGE OF BASE HE BLOSSOMED OUT DELIGHTFULLY AS SICK PEOPLE DO SOMETIMES AND SURPRISED HIS FAMILY BY BEING UNEXPECTEDLY PATIENT GRATEFUL AND AMIABLE
THAT S JUST THE WAY THE HEROINES GO ON CRIED TOM
PULL UP YOUR SLEEVE AND GIVE ME AN ARM WHILE YOU SIT
I DON'T MIND THE ABSURDITY AND QUITE LONG TO GO AND COMFORT THAT POOR GIRL WITH THE BROKEN HEART SAID POLLY WITH A SIGH AS THE CURTAIN FELL ON A MOST AFFECTING TABLEAU
IS THAT THE WAY POLLY SOOTHES THE BEST OF BROTHERS SAID TOM STILL LAUGHING
POLLY'S HEART WAS FULL BUT SHE TOLD NO ONE AND BORE HER TROUBLE SILENTLY FEELING HER FRIEND'S INGRATITUDE AND INJUSTICE DEEPLY
POLLY THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SEEN HER AND APPROACHED WITH A CURIOUS LITTLE FLUTTER AT HER HEART FOR IF TOM CUT HER SHE FELT THAT HER CUP WOULD BE FULL
YOU MAY CALL ME MARY IF YOU LIKE
ARTHUR SYDNEY IS A REAL NOBLEMAN CRIED POLLY LOOKING UP AT LAST WITH HER FACT GLOWING AND HER EYES FULL OF DELIGHT
SHE IS AFRAID OF HER FATHER AND MAKES HER MOTHER DO AS SHE LIKES
IF THEY DON'T ASK I THINK THERE S NO HARM IN KEEPING STILL
CHAPTER XIII
IT S AS PROVOKING AS AUNT BETSEY HERSELF SAID NELLY AS WE SAT DOWN OUT OF BREATH
S
S
S
FOR I THINK MY HOUSEKEEPING ARRANGEMENTS WILL AMUSE YOU THEN POLLY SHOWED HER KINGDOM AND THE THREE HAD A MERRY TIME OVER IT
BUT WHEN THAT BONNET WENT ON POLLY ACTUALLY HELD HER BREATH TILL IT WAS SAFELY LANDED AND THE PINK ROSE BLOOMED ABOVE THE SMOOTH WAVES OF HAIR WITH WHAT FANNY CALLED A RAVISHING EFFECT AT THIS SUCCESSFUL STAGE OF AFFAIRS POLLY FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST THE LOAN OF A PAIR OF GOLD BANDS FOR THE WRISTS AND FANNY'S WHITE FAN WITH THE LITTLE MIRROR IN THE MIDDLE
HE ALWAYS DOES FAN SAYS THAT S THE WORST OF IT YOU SEE
I THINK IT WILL
FATHER WOULD N'T HAVE ANYTHING MOVED AND TOM SITS UP THERE SOMETIMES
I VE ALWAYS BEEN FOND OF YOU MY POLLY BUT I NEVER REALIZED HOW FOND TILL JUST BEFORE I WENT AWAY
I LL MANAGE THE OLD CHAP AND THE HORSES TOO AND OPENING THE DOOR TOM VANISHED ALOFT LEAVING POOR VICTIMIZED POLLY TO QUAKE INSIDE WHILE HE PLACIDLY REVELLED IN FREEDOM AND PEANUTS OUTSIDE WITH THE STAID OLD DRIVER
AND YOU SHALL PUT YOUR NAME DOWN HERE ON THE STICKS OF MY FAN
TELL MORE ABOUT YOUR PAPA PLEASE
YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE WHISPERED POLLY AS SHE TURNED FROM GREETING THEIR NEIGHBORS AND SAW A DROLL LOOK ON TOM'S FACE
I LL PLAY WITH YOU
MOPING IN HER ROOM I SUPPOSE REPLIED TOM WHO WAS DISCOVERED READING STUDIOUSLY
HE WILL BE HERE NEXT WEEK AND THEN WE LL HAVE A GRAND CLEARING UP OF MYSTERIES SAID FAN EVIDENTLY FEELING THAT THE MILLENNIUM WAS AT HAND
PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU A LITTLE BIT SAID POLLY AS TOM WIPED HIS HOT FACE AND REFRESHED HIMSELF WITH A PEANUT
GOOD TIMES NEVER DO WITH US
NICE LITTLE OLD LADY IS N'T SHE ADDED FAN AS SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF MISS MILLS ON THEIR WAY OUT SITTING AT A TABLE PILED WITH WORK AND SEWING AWAY WITH AN ENERGY THAT MADE THE GRAY CURLS VIBRATE
YOUR REAL FRIENDS WON'T DROP YOU AND YOU LL FIND OUT WHICH THE TRUE ONES ARE NOW
WILD FELLOW DO HIM GOOD GRANTED
SHE WAS RATHER AFRAID OF THEM THEY SEEMED SO MUCH OLDER AND WISER THAN HERSELF EVEN THOSE YOUNGER IN YEARS
THIS MILKING FEAT WAS SUCH A GOOD JOKE THAT NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE REMEMBERED MUCH ABOUT THE GREAT MAN THOUGH ONE OF HIS OFFICERS A COUNT SIGNALIZED HIMSELF BY GETTING VERY TIPSY AND GOING TO BED WITH HIS BOOTS AND SPURS ON WHICH CAUSED THE DESTRUCTION OF AUNT'S BEST YELLOW DAMASK COVERLET FOR THE RESTLESS SLEEPER KICKED IT INTO RAGS BY MORNING
IN HIS PRESENT STATE OF MIND TOM FELT AS IF HE DID NOT DESERVE A BLESSED THING
WHO IS THE LITTLE GIRL ASKED POLLY TAKING THE NEWS AS A JOKE
SHOULD N'T WONDER IF YOU COULD AND TOM SPREAD THE BOOK BETWEEN THEM WITH A GRAVE AND BUSINESS-LIKE AIR FOR HE FELT THAT POLLY HAD GOT THE BETTER OF HIM AND IT BEHOOVED HIM TO DO HIS BEST FOR THE HONOR OF HIS SEX
BLESSED INNOCENCE
AFTER THE DAMAGES WERE REPAIRED AND THE FLURRY WAS WELL OVER JACK CONFESSED THAT HE HAD MARKED THE DOOR FOR FUN AND SHUT BIDDY OUT AS A PUNISHMENT FOR GALLIVANTING OF WHICH HE DID N'T APPROVE
BUT PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO LISTEN TO THE SONGS AND CONVERSATION AND THEN THE ILLUSION VANISHED
LET HIM THUMP AND CALL IT ONLY SERVES HIM RIGHT
DELUGED HIS GRIMY HANDKERCHIEF WITH FAN'S BEST COLOGNE
AFRAID OF SPOILING HER CRINKLES AND TOM SMILED FOR THIS BASE BETRAYAL OF CONFIDENCE MADE HIM FEEL HIS OWN MAN AGAIN
POLLY HOPED THE DREADFUL BOY WOULD NOT BE PRESENT
WESTERN NEWS CONTINUED VAGUE FOR FAN'S GENERAL INQUIRIES PRODUCED ONLY PROVOKINGLY UNSATISFACTORY REPLIES FROM TOM WHO SANG THE PRAISES OF THE BEAUTIFUL MISS BAILEY AND PROFESSED TO BE CONSUMED BY A HOPELESS PASSION FOR SOMEBODY IN SUCH HALF-COMIC HALF-TRAGIC TERMS THAT THE GIRLS COULD NOT DECIDE WHETHER IT WAS ALL THAT BOY'S MISCHIEF OR ONLY A CLOAK TO HIDE THE DREADFUL TRUTH
DO IT S SUCH FUN CRIED FANNY QUITE SURPRISING HER FRIEND BY THIS UNEXPECTED FONDNESS FOR SCHOOL
THEN THERE IS N'T ANY SPARKING SUNDAY NIGHT SUNG TOM WHO APPEARED TO HAVE WAKED UP AGAIN
TOM AND HIS FRIENDS WERE DISCUSSING BASE-BALL ON THE STAIRS
THE THIRD A SMALL POSY OF SCARLET VERBENAS WHITE FEVERFEW AND GREEN LEAVES
I DON'T SEE WHAT FUN THERE IS IN IT SAID FANNY AS THEY WENT UP STAIRS
HERE S A PAIR OF CHEEKS
I LL JUST HUG HIM AND SAY I M EVER SO GLAD WE ARE GOING TO THE LITTLE HOUSE CRIED MAUD SCRAMBLING OFF THE BED AND RUNNING DOWN STAIRS
DID SHE WEAR HER PARIS HAT TO-DAY ADDED FAN WITH SUDDEN INTEREST IN HER VOICE
FIRE AWAY POLLY SAID THE YOUNG SULTAN ONE EVENING AS HIS LITTLE SCHEHERAZADE SAT DOWN IN HER LOW CHAIR AFTER STIRRING UP THE FIRE TILL THE ROOM WAS BRIGHT AND COSY
I THINK HE WILL HE IS SO FOND OF STUDY AND IS SO ANXIOUS TO IMPROVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY
POLLY WAS LIFTED OUT OF HERSELF AND WHEN SHE TURNED ROUND THE SOFTENED LOOK ON ALL THE FACES TOLD HER THAT FOR THE MOMENT FOOLISH DIFFERENCES AND FRIVOLOUS BELIEFS WERE FORGOTTEN IN THE ONE WOMANLY SENTIMENT OF PITY FOR THE WRONGS AND WOES OF WHICH THE LISTENERS HAPPY LIVES WERE IGNORANT
MAUD AND THE YOUNG LADIES WERE SITTING ON THE SOFA TALKING ABOUT EACH OTHER'S CLOTHES AS THEY HAD SEEN THEIR MAMMAS DO
THE PILLOW WAS EASILY DISPOSED OF BUT THAT PIE
SOME BAD FELLOW PUT A TORPEDO OR SOME SORT OF POWDER THING UNDER THE CHAIR AND IT WENT OFF IN THE MIDST OF THE LESSON AND THE POOR MAN FLEW UP FRIGHTENED MOST TO PIECES AND THE BOYS RAN WITH PAILS OF WATER TO PUT THE FIRE OUT
I LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT FOR I THINK YOU MAY BE ABLE TO HELP ME
POOR TOM HAS GOT A DREADFUL TOOTHACHE AND I CAME DOWN TO FIND SOME CREOSOTE FOR HIM
THEN WE THREW STONES BUT ONLY ONE GREEN AND ONE HALF-RIPE ONE CAME DOWN AND MY LAST STONE BROKE THE SHED WINDOW SO THERE WAS AN END OF THAT
POOR PEOPLE ALWAYS COMPLAIN THAT THE WINTER IS A HARD ONE AND NEVER ARE SATISFIED REMARKED MISS PERKINS MAKING HER DIAMONDS SPARKLE AS SHE SEWED BUTTONS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF A PINK CALICO APRON WHICH WOULD HARDLY SURVIVE ONE WASHING
BUT YOU WON'T EVER WANT TO DANCE WITH ME ANY MORE HE ADDED AS HE BEGAN TO FAN HER SO VIOLENTLY THAT HER HAIR FLEW ABOUT AS IF IN A GALE OF WIND
GOOD FOR YOU POLLY AND CASTING HIMSELF UPON HIS SLED WITH THE MOST RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR HIS RIBS OFF WHIZZED TOM AFTER HER AND CAME ALONGSIDE JUST AS SHE REINED UP GENERAL GRANT ON THE BROAD PATH BELOW
NO YOU RE NOT HOW WILL YOU HELP IT MISS PRIM SO AND POLLY LOCKED THE DOOR PUT THE KEY IN HER POCKET AND NODDED AT HIM DEFIANTLY
WHAT SHALL WE PLAY I DON'T KNOW
FORGETTING HIS COSTUME HE STRODE UP TO POLLY SAYING WITH A THREATENING WAG OF THE HEAD NONE OF THAT
AND I LL GET MAMMA TO LET YOU HAVE THAT HORRID NED MILLER THAT YOU ARE SO FOND OF COME AND MAKE YOU A VISIT AFTER POLLY S GONE SAID FANNY HOPING TO SOOTHE HIS RUFFLED FEELINGS
DOES ALL GO SMOOTHLY FAN ASKED POLLY BEGINNING TO BRUSH HER HAIR INDUSTRIOUSLY
I VE A RIGHT TO ASK AND YOU OUGHT TO TELL SAID TOM SOBERLY FOR HE WAS BEGINNING TO FIND THAT BEING ENGAGED WAS NOT UNMITIGATED BLISS
BUT YOU DON'T CATCH ME STUDYING MYSELF TO DEATH AND NO PAY FOR IT IT IS TOO BAD
AND TOM ONLY DID IT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
SOME ONE SAID THAT VERY THING TO FATHER ONCE AND I REMEMBER HE ANSWERED I AM GLAD TO GIVE MY BEST AND BRIGHTEST SON TO THE SERVICE OF GOD DID HE SAY THAT AND WILL'S COLOR ROSE FOR THE BIG BOOK-LOVING FELLOW WAS AS SENSITIVE AS A GIRL TO THE PRAISE OF THOSE DEAREST TO HIM
NED IS DOING WELL OUT WEST AND I M HARD AT IT HERE
HALF THE GIRLS DO IT EITHER PAINT OR POWDER DARKEN THEIR LASHES WITH BURNT HAIR-PINS OR TAKE COLOGNE ON LUMPS OF SUGAR OR BELLADONNA TO MAKE THEIR EYES BRIGHT
MAY N'T HE HAVE HIS VELOCIPEDE NOW CAPITAL TOM
I DARE SAY
I PROMISE SOLEMNLY I LL NEVER SAY A WORD TO A MORTAL CREATURE
YOU KEPT YOUR WORD AND STOOD BY ME LIKE A GOOD BOY
TOM DID N'T QUITE LIKE THE DIFFERENT WAY IN WHICH SHE TREATED THEM AND THE WORD BOY DISTURBED HIS DIGNITY FOR HE WAS ALMOST TWENTY-ONE AND POLLY OUGHT TO TREAT HIM WITH MORE RESPECT
YOU ARE AN EXTRAVAGANT SET NOW-A-DAYS AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE COMING TO
YOUR FATHER USED TO BE A VERY GALLANT YOUNG GENTLEMAN ONCE UPON A TIME SAID MRS SHAW WITH A SIMPER
SHE KNEW THAT HE WANTED WOMANLY SYMPATHY AND THAT SHE COULD GIVE IT TO HIM BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT AFRAID TO STRETCH HER HAND ACROSS THE BARRIER WHICH OUR ARTIFICIAL EDUCATION PUTS BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS AND TO SAY TO HIM IN ALL GOOD FAITH IF I CAN HELP YOU LET ME TEN MINUTES SOONER POLLY COULD HAVE DONE THIS ALMOST AS EASILY TO TOM AS TO WILL BUT IN THAT TEN MINUTES SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED WHICH MADE THIS DIFFICULT
AS FANNY'S GUEST SHE HAD BEEN IN SPITE OF POVERTY KINDLY RECEIVED WHEREVER HER FRIEND TOOK HER BOTH AS CHILD AND WOMAN
HOW HAPPY THEY SEEM
IT IS N'T TOM IT S I OF COURSE THERE WAS A RAPTURE FOLLOWED BY ONE OF THE DELICIOUSLY CONFIDENTIAL TALKS WHICH BOSOM FRIENDS ENJOY INTERSPERSED WITH TEARS AND KISSES SMILES AND SIGHS
WE HAD PLUMS ENOUGH THAT AUTUMN BUT DID N'T SEEM TO CARE MUCH ABOUT THEM AFTER ALL FOR OUR PRANK BECAME A HOUSEHOLD JOKE AND FOR YEARS WE NEVER SAW THE FRUIT BUT NELLY WOULD LOOK AT ME WITH A FUNNY FACE AND WHISPER PURPLE STOCKINGS FAN THANK YOU MA'AM SAID POLLY
I SUPPOSE MY GRAY SQUIRREL IS EVER SO MUCH TOO BIG
DO GO ALONG OR YOU LL BE TOO LATE
SHE CAN'T BEAR P WELL I CAN
BUT TOM'S STRONG FINGERS WERE IRRESISTIBLE
DO RUN
DEBBY S ASLEEP
ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE HEARD A MOVEMENT AND TOM'S VOICE SAY AUDIBLY LET ME BRING POLLY AND HE APPEARED LOOKING SO PALE AND MISERABLE THAT POLLY WAS FRIGHTENED
BUT YOU WANTED IT SO I PUT IT IN TO MAKE YOU LAUGH
AT A TABLE WHERE THE LIGHT WAS CLEAREST SAT A FRAIL-LOOKING GIRL WITH A THIN FACE BIG EYES AND PALE HAIR A DREAMY ABSORBED LITTLE PERSON WHO BENT OVER A BLOCK SKILLFULLY WIELDING HER TOOLS
OH PUTTEL PUTTEL WHAT A FOOL I AM PUSS APPEARED TO ENDORSE THE SENTIMENT BY A LOUD PURR AND A GRACEFUL WAVE OF HER TAIL AND POLLY RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT FROM WHICH THESE LITTLE VANITIES HAD BEGUILED HER
IT S JUST A LITTLE TRANSACTION BETWEEN TWO FRIENDS WHO EXCHANGE THINGS THEY DON'T WANT FOR THINGS WHICH THEY DO AND I D DO IT IF I WERE YOU WE LL SEE ABOUT IT SAID FAN PRIVATELY RESOLVING TO TAKE POLLY'S ADVICE
THEN TELL US WHERE SHE IS
THEN I GOT DROWSY AND WAS JUST DROPPING OFF WHEN THE SOUND OF STEPS OUTSIDE WOKE ME UP STARING WIDE AWAKE
BUT EVEN WHILE SHE LAUGHED SHE RESOLVED NOT TO LET HIM MORTIFY HIS SISTER
MAUD FOUND THE DRIVE ALTOGETHER TOO SHORT BUT WAS CONSOLED BY THE PROMISE OF A LONGER ONE IF THE SLEIGHING LASTED TILL NEXT SATURDAY
HE SENDS ME ONE EVERY WEEK
NOT QUITE WELL DEAR I LL TELL YOU
HE KNOWS I LOVE THEM SO AND POLLY'S EYES TURNED THAT WAY FULL OF PRIDE AND PLEASURE
SHE MAKES NICER DOLLS THAN YOU FAN
JIMMY
AND THAT WHILE SHE TRIED TO HELP OTHERS SHE WAS SERVING HERSELF IN A WAY THAT WOULD IMPROVE HEART AND SOUL MORE THAN ANY MERE SOCIAL SUCCESS SHE MIGHT GAIN BY FOLLOWING THE RULES OF FASHIONABLE LIFE WHICH DRILL THE CHARACTER OUT OF GIRLS TILL THEY ARE AS MUCH ALIKE AS PINS IN A PAPER AND HAVE ABOUT AS MUCH TRUE SENSE AND SENTIMENT IN THEIR LITTLE HEADS
WHILE ALL ABOUT THE FACE WERE THOSE UNMISTAKABLE LINES AND CURVES WHICH CAN MAKE EVEN A PLAIN COUNTENANCE COMELY BY BREATHING INTO IT THE BEAUTY OF A LOVELY CHARACTER
TOM CHAPTER VI
HE BEGAN WITHOUT MUCH SPIRIT
NOW DON'T YOU SCOLD
FOR WE WERE PLAYING THAT LADY FITZ PERKINS HAD FAINTED AND WAS BEING BORNE HOME SENSELESS IN A CAB
MR SHAW HAD NOT SAID HE SHOULD COME HOME SO EARLY BUT POLLY THOUGHT HE MIGHT AND WENT TO MEET HIM
THEN GRANDMA CAREFULLY DONE
LET S RUN SAID POLLY AS THEY CAME INTO THE PATH AFTER THE LAST COAST
YOU RE GETTING UP A FLIRTATION WITH TOM ARE YOU WHISPERED FANNY TO HER FRIEND AS IF MUCH AMUSED
THE LOVER WON'T SEPARATE THIS PAIR OF FRIENDS YOU SEE WHISPERED POLLY TO FAN
WELL YOU KNOW WE FELLOWS ARE SO BUSY WE HAVE N'T MUCH TIME TO ENJOY OURSELVES ANSWERED TOM
BUT POLLY WAS SO GAY SO SATISFIED WITH HER SMALL ESTABLISHMENT SO FULL OF HAPPY HOPES AND PLANS THAT HER FRIEND HAD NOT THE HEART TO FIND A FAULT OR SUGGEST AN IMPROVEMENT AND SAT WHERE SHE WAS TOLD LAUGHING AND TALKING WHILE THE OTHERS GOT TEA
JANE BRYANT
I DON'T FEEL LIKE STORIES TO-NIGHT TOM
I DON'T THINK IT IS NOWADAYS SAID FANNY WITH A TIRED SORT OF SIGH
WE PLUNGED AT ONCE INTO A WHIRL OF GAYETY AND I HAVE HAD NO TIME TO THINK OF ANYTHING BUT PLEASURE
POLLY ARRIVES IT S TIME TO GO TO THE STATION TOM COME ON THEN OH I M NOT GOING
NEEDLES AND TONGUES DEAR POLLY THE SEWING CIRCLE MEETS AT OUR HOUSE THIS P
I GIVE IT AWAY OR LET MAUD HAVE IT FOR TABLEAUX I WONDER IF YOU WOULD MIND MY TELLING YOU SOMETHING BELLE PROPOSED IF IT S AN OFFER TO BUY MY CLOTHES I SHOULD MIND ANSWERED FANNY SHARPLY
IT WOULD BE THE MAKING OF HIM
FOR A WEEK AFTER TOM'S MISHAP THE YOUNG FOLKS WERE QUITE ANGELIC SO MUCH SO THAT GRANDMA SAID SHE WAS AFRAID SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM THE DEAR OLD LADY NEED N'T HAVE FELT ANXIOUS FOR SUCH EXCESSIVE VIRTUE DOES N'T LAST LONG ENOUGH TO LEAD TO TRANSLATION EXCEPT WITH LITTLE PRIGS IN THE GOODY STORY-BOOKS
A GREAT DEAL WAS NEEDED AND VERY LITTLE COULD BE BOUGHT OR BORROWED SO DESPAIR FELL UPON THE COOKS AND MAIDS AND THE GREAT BREAKFAST WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAILURE IF MADAM WITH THE PRESENCE OF MIND OF HER SEX HAD NOT SUDDENLY BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF THE COWS FEEDING ON THE COMMON
WHAT QUEER GLOVES YOU WORE THEN INTERRUPTED FANNY WHO HAD BEEN TRYING ON THE MUCH-HONORED GLOVE AND FINDING IT A TIGHT FIT
TELL SOME NOW PLEASE
HOW TOM LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW THEM
OH I FORGOT
AND THEY WOULD IF THE BOYS WERE AS KIND TO THEM AS JIMMY WAS TO ME WHY WHAT DID HE DO LOVED ME DEARLY AND WAS N'T ASHAMED TO SHOW IT CRIED POLLY WITH A SOB IN HER VOICE THAT MADE HER ANSWER VERY ELOQUENT
DON'T SCREAM SO YOU LL FRIGHTEN POLLY AND FAN GAVE THE CHERUB A SHAKE WHICH PRODUCED AN EXPLANATION
THIS DEPENDENCE OF HIS MOTHER'S WAS TOM'S SALVATION AT THAT CRISIS OF HIS LIFE
I M PERFECTLY FAINTING TO KNOW WHAT THE MATTER IS SAID FAN
WE YOUNG FOLKS QUITE LOST OUR HEADS THAT NIGHT AND I HAVE N'T A VERY CLEAR IDEA OF HOW I GOT HOME
THE FACT IS I COULD N'T STAND IT HERE WHERE I M KNOWN
OTHERS THAT THERE WAS A BOY IN THE GANG FOR WINDOWS SO SMALL THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERED SAFE WERE ENTERED BY SOME LITTLE ROGUE
I CAN WATCH YOU BETTER THAN PAPA CAN
TOM DID HIS BEST TO BE A GOOD HOST
MAUD ADMIRED TOM WITH ALL HER HEART AND MADE A LITTLE SLAVE OF HERSELF TO HIM FEELING WELL REPAID IF HE MERELY SAID THANK YOU CHICKEN OR DID N'T PINCH HER NOSE OR NIP HER EAR AS HE HAD A WAY OF DOING JUST AS IF I WAS A DOLL OR A DOG AND HAD N'T GOT ANY FEELINGS SHE SOMETIMES SAID TO FANNY WHEN SOME SERVICE OR SACRIFICE HAD BEEN ACCEPTED WITHOUT GRATITUDE OR RESPECT
IT GAVE POLLY QUITE A TURN FOR SHE THOUGHT NO ONE WAS HEARING HER BUT THE OLD LADY DOZING BY THE FIRE
I M AFRAID HE HAS EATEN ONE OF YOUR GLOVES
I D LIKE TO LEARN PAPA AND POLLY IS A SPLENDID TEACHER I KNOW
BUT I SHALL CHARGE EXTRA ANSWERED POLLY WITH A WICKED SPARKLE OF THE EYE THOUGH HER FACE WAS QUITE SOBER AND HER TONE DELIGHTFULLY BUSINESS-LIKE
FAN HAS N'T TREATED YOU WELL AND IT WILL SERVE HER RIGHT IF YOU INTRODUCE ME AS YOUR DEAR FRIEND MISS SHAW
FOR IN SPITE OF HIS AIRS HE IS AS SOFT-HEARTED AS A BABY
NO YOU WOULD N'T
ALLOW ME TO CONGRATULATE YOU MRS SYDNEY ADDED TOM ADVANCING WITH HIS WEDDING-RECEPTION BOW AND A WICKED LOOK AT FANNY
RATHER A PLEASANT LITTLE PROSPECT HEY POLLY MY BONNET IS STRAIGHT AND THAT S ALL I CARE ABOUT
WOULD YOU HAVE A WHITE-MUSLIN APRON OR A BLACK SILK ADDED POLLY SURVEYING HER WORK WITH SATISFACTION
SHE WOULD MAKE A FINE QUEEN ANSWERED FANNY
I WAS A BEAST THAT S WHAT I WAS SAID TOM IN A TONE OF GREAT DISGUST
WELL I THINK YOU WERE THE BRAVEST OF THE LOT
I M FIDGETY AND WANT TO BE AMOOSED AS PUG SAYS JUST WAIT TILL I FINISH MY CHAPTER AND THEN I LL COME SAID PITIFUL POLLY
WHEN FOUR-AND-TWENTY GIRLS DRESSED AS JOCKEYS CAME PRANCING ON TO THE STAGE CRACKING THEIR WHIPS STAMPING THE HEELS OF THEIR TOPBOOTS AND WINKING AT THE AUDIENCE POLLY DID NOT THINK IT AT ALL FUNNY BUT LOOKED DISGUSTED AND WAS GLAD WHEN THEY WERE GONE
THERE S NO NEED OF IT AND I DON'T THINK THEY D CURE MY WORRYING SAID FANNY LANGUIDLY FEEDING ASHPUTTEL WHO SAT DECOROUSLY BESIDE HER AT THE TABLE WINKING AT THE CREAM POT
POLLY UNDERSTOOD THIS AND FOUND THE HONEST HEARTY SPEECH OF HER LOVER MORE ELOQUENT THAN POETRY ITSELF
I VE GOT THREE WOMEN HARD AT WORK AND WANT ANOTHER BUT EVERYONE IS SO BUSY AND ASK SUCH ABOMINABLE PRICES THAT I M IN DESPAIR AND SHALL HAVE TO TAKE HOLD MYSELF I M AFRAID THERE S A CHANCE FOR JANE THOUGHT POLLY BUT HAD N'T COURAGE TO SPEAK OUT LOUD IN MEETING JUST THEN AND RESOLVED TO ASK TRIX FOR WORK IN PRIVATE
EMMA GOT UP AND WENT TO POLLY WITH A FACE FULL OF AFFECTIONATE RESPECT WHILE FANNY MOVED BY A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAUGHT UP A COSTLY SEVRES PLATE THAT STOOD ON THE ETAGERE AND LAYING A FIVE-DOLLAR BILL IN IT PASSED IT ROUND QUOTING POLLY'S WORDS GIRLS I KNOW YOU LL LIKE TO HELP POOR LITTLE JENNY BEGIN AGAIN AND DO BETTER THIS TIME IT WAS GOOD TO SEE HOW QUICKLY THE PRETTY PURSES WERE OUT HOW GENEROUSLY EACH GAVE OF ITS ABUNDANCE AND WHAT HEARTY APPLAUSE BROKE FROM THE GIRLS AS BELLE LAID DOWN HER GOLD THIMBLE SAYING WITH AN APRIL FACE THERE TAKE THAT
SHE ONLY EXPLAINS THINGS TO US AND HELPS US BE GOOD AND NEVER SCOLDS AND I D RATHER HAVE HER THAN ANY OTHER MOTHER IN THE WORLD THOUGH SHE DON'T WEAR VELVET CLOAKS AND SPLENDID BONNETS SO NOW GO IT POLLY CALLED TOM WHO WAS GRACEFULLY HANGING HEAD DOWNWARD FROM THE BAR PUT UP FOR HIS SPECIAL BENEFIT
SHE S ALWAYS SO PATIENT AND MAKES EVERYTHING SO PLEASANT
SO I WON'T TELL ON YOU SAID TOM WITH A RE-ASSURING NOD
HER SASH WAS ONLY A WIDE RIBBON TIED IN A SIMPLE BOW AND NOTHING BUT A BLUE SNOOD IN THE PRETTY CURLS
I DID N'T KNOW YOU COULD BE SO SENTIMENTAL SHE SAID LOOKING SO PLEASED THAT HE DID NOT REGRET CONFESSING HIS FOLLY
BUT I DOUBT IT ANSWERED POLLY IN A TONE THAT MADE FANNY WONDER IF SHE TOO KNEW WHAT HEARTACHE MEANT
THERE WILL BE AN IMMENSE DEAL OF WORK IN ALL THIS FIXING OVER AND I HATE TO SEW SAID FANNY TO DIVERT A CERTAIN PERSON'S THOUGHTS
BUT IF I EVER GET AT ALL LIKE ONE IT WILL BE MOTHER'S PREACHING THAT DID IT SAID POLLY WITH A HAPPY LAUGH
IT S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP STEADY ANY LONGER
SHE FELT SO NOW ABOUT HERSELF
WHEN SHE CAME TO THE END SHE STOOD A MINUTE AS IF TOO INDIGNANT TO SPEAK THEN GAVE THE PAPER A NERVOUS SORT OF CRUMPLE AND DROPPED IT ON THE FLOOR SAYING ALL IN ONE BREATH I THINK SHE IS A MERCENARY HEARTLESS UNGRATEFUL GIRL
I SUPPOSE I VE GOT TO SPEAK TO HER SO HERE GOES AND NERVING HIMSELF TO THE TASK TOM SLOWLY APPROACHED THE DAMSEL WHO LOOKED AS IF THE WIND HAD BLOWN HER CLOTHES INTO RAGS SUCH A FLAPPING OF SASHES SCALLOPS RUFFLES CURLS AND FEATHERS WAS THERE
SO OF COURSE IT WAS MUCH ADMIRED AND EVERY ONE WENT TO SEE IT
YOU CAN'T CLIMB THE TREE FAN DON'T ASK QUESTIONS BUT BE READY TO PICK EM UP WHEN THEY FALL MISS LAZYBONES WITH THIS MYSTERIOUS SPEECH I PATTERED INTO THE HOUSE BARE-FOOTED AND FULL OF MY PLAN
WHAT IN THUNDER DO I CARE ABOUT THE OLD CARTHAGINIANS
YOU PUT A LOT ON THE FLANNEL AND DO UP YOUR WRIST AND I GUESS IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT IN THE MORNING
ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES IN THE DESERTED DINING-ROOM THE CHILDREN FELL TO WORK
HE DID N'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT TO DO BUT IT HAD SUDDENLY COME OVER HIM THAT HE WAS HIDING FROM THE STORM AND LETTING HIS FATHER MEET IT ALONE
BUT HE TRIES TO BE AND I LOVE HIM DEARLY FOR IT WILL FANNY'S VOICE QUITE STARTLED POLLY IT WAS SO SHARP AND SUDDEN AND HER FACE GREW RED AND PALE ALL IN A MINUTE AS SHE UPSET THE LITTLE VASE WITH THE START SHE GAVE
O I KNOW
FOR SHE HAD SAID THOSE WORDS HERSELF IN A FIT OF PETULANCE AND POLLY HAD MADE NO ANSWER THOUGH HER EYES FILLED AND HER CHEEKS BURNED
I DID
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WILL FEEL GOOD FOR I SHALL BE THINKING ABOUT MY LOST PRESENTS ALL THE TIME SIGHED POLLY PUSHING THE ENTICING BOOTS OUT OF SIGHT
AND THE BEST NEEDLEWOMAN SHALL HAVE A PRETTY BIT OF WHITE SATIN FOR A DOLL'S BONNET FANNY EXERTED HERSELF AND WON THE PRIZE FOR POLLY HELPED MAUD AND NEGLECTED HER OWN WORK
SO NOW SAID BLANCHE
AND I M PROUD OF HIM SAID TOM LOOKING UP ALL RED AND EXCITED WITH THE EMOTIONS HE WAS TRYING TO KEEP UNDER
DEAR OLD FELLOW HE IS DOING SO WELL I REALLY BEGIN TO FEEL QUITE PROUD OF HIM FAN TOSSED HER THE PHOTOGRAPH AND WENT ON RUMMAGING FOR A CERTAIN NOTE
MY MOTHER LETS ME
WE VE USED UP ALL THERE WAS IN THE JUG SAID POLLY GOOD-NATUREDLY BEGINNING AGAIN
POOR DEAR DID SHE GET HER LITTLE BONNET KNOCKED INTO A COCKED HAT AND HER LITTLE TEMPER RILED AT THE SAME TIME POLLY COULD N'T HELP LAUGHING AND IN SPITE OF THE CRUSH ENJOYED THE SLOW JOURNEY FROM SEAT TO CARRIAGE FOR TOM TOOK SUCH EXCELLENT CARE OF HER SHE WAS RATHER SORRY WHEN IT WAS OVER
WHEN THEY CAME DOWN WITH THE DISH IN WHICH TO SET FORTH THEIR TREAT AND OPENED THE BACK-DOOR TO FIND IT IMAGINE THEIR DISMAY ON DISCOVERING THAT IT WAS GONE PAN CANDY AND ALL UTTERLY AND MYSTERIOUSLY GONE
HE SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW IN EVERY ROOM YET NO SIGN OF THE GIRT APPEARED AND TOM BEGAN TO GET ANXIOUS
I JUST WISH YOU COULD HAVE HEARD THEM GO ON
GOOD GRACIOUS
I USED TO THINK PATRONAGE AND THINGS OF THAT SORT VERY DISAGREEABLE AND NOT WORTH HAVING BUT I VE GOT WISER AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT I M GLAD TO USE WHATEVER ADVANTAGES I HAVE IN MY POWER IF THEY CAN BE HONESTLY GOT WHY DID N'T YOU LET US HELP YOU IN THE BEGINNING
OH TOM THAT S A BIRTHDAY PRESENT WORTH HAVING FOR IT S SO BEAUTIFULLY GIVEN I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN REFUSE IT
NOT FOR A LONG WHILE PLEASE
YOU KNOW YOU SAID YOU WOULD SOME TIME
SOME OF HER ATTEMPTS WERE SUCCESSFUL OTHERS WERE FAILURES
YOU BELIEVE THAT SUCH THINGS ARE TRUE
SING IT AGAIN PLEASE CRIED TOM'S VOICE
I M TIRED OF THIS SAID MARY SLAPPING AWAY AT THE MOSQUITOES
AND TO-MORROW EVERY ONE WILL KNOW IT POLLY HELD ON TO THE BACK OF TOM'S CHAIR FOR A MINUTE FOR THE NEWS TOOK HER BREATH AWAY AND SHE FELT AS IF THE WORLD WAS COMING TO AN END FAILED WAS SUCH A VAGUELY DREADFUL WORD TO HER
BACON AND ALE FOR BREAKFAST AND DINNER AT TWELVE
HE LL CROW OVER US
YOUR FOOT IS PERFECTLY DIVINE IN THAT BOOT POLLY
BUT BEFORE SHE COULD LOAD AND FIRE AGAIN EMMA DAVENPORT WHO LABORED UNDER THE DELUSION THAT THIS SORT OF SKIRMISHING WAS ILL-NATURED AND THEREFORE ILL-BRED SPOKE UP IN HER PLEASANT WAY SPEAKING OF PITYING THE POOR I ALWAYS WONDER WHY IT IS THAT WE ALL LIKE TO READ AND CRY OVER THEIR TROUBLES IN BOOKS BUT WHEN WE HAVE THE REAL THING BEFORE US WE THINK IT IS UNINTERESTING AND DISAGREEABLE IT S THE GENIUS THAT GETS INTO THE BOOKS WHICH MAKES US LIKE THE POVERTY I FANCY
I DON'T DO ANYTHING OF THE SORT OR NEED IT BUT TRIX DOES
THE DOMESTIC NATURE OF THE STORY MAKES THIS AUDACIOUS PROCEEDING POSSIBLE
POLLY GROANED AND OFFERED NO MORE SUGGESTIONS AS THE WORK WENT ON
I M GOING TO BEGIN WITH A REDOWA BECAUSE THE GIRLS LIKE IT AND IT S BETTER FUN THAN SQUARE DANCES
BUT TOM CRIED OUT REMORSEFULLY THAT S WHAT KNOCKS ME OVER
IT S SUCH A LOVELY DAY ALL THE BABIES WILL BE OUT AND IT ALWAYS DOES ME GOOD TO SEE THEM THOUGHT POLLY TURNING INTO THE WIDE SUNNY STREET WHERE WEST END-DOM PROMENADED AT THAT HOUR
YOU KNOW SHE MADE A PRETTY LADY OF WHOM SHE WAS JEALOUS SIT BESIDE HER ON A GREEN SOFA WHICH SET OFF HER OWN WHITE DRESS AND SPOILT THE BLUE ONE OF HER GUEST ANSWERED POLLY BUSY WITH THE FLOWERS
SITTING HERE WITH YOU REMINDED ME OF THE WAY I USED TO SIT WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS SICK
OF COURSE THE BOYS CAME EARLY AND STOOD ABOUT IN CORNERS LOOKING AS IF THEY HAD MORE ARMS AND LEGS THAN THEY KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH
BUT HE WAS AND STARED AT HER ALL DINNER-TIME IN A MOST TRYING MANNER
I WAS WAKEFUL AND LAY LISTENING TO THE CRICKETS TILL THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE
IT S THE FIRST BLOW THAT HURTS MOST GLAD TO SEE YOU TAKE THE LAST BLOW SO WELL THERE WAS AN IRONICAL LITTLE TWANG TO THAT SPEECH AND POLLY COULD N'T HELP IT
CUT CAREFULLY POLLY AND DON'T WASTE YOUR CLOTH
POLLY TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE TOTAL AND CLASPED HER HANDS FOR TO HER INEXPERIENCED EYES IT LOOKED APPALLING
AS SHE LAID BY THE LITTLE BOOK THE CONFESSIONS IN IT REPROACHED HER MORE SHARPLY THAT ANY WORDS POLLY COULD HAVE SPOKEN
PUT ON THE POT BESS AND SKIM THE MILK ADDED BECKY AS SHE PRODUCED CUPS MUGS AND A QUEER LITTLE VASE TO SUPPLY DRINKING VESSELS FOR THE PARTY
I WISH THE WIND WOULD COME AND BLOW EM DOWN FOR US PANTED I STARING UP AT THE PLUMS WITH LONGING EYES
YOU ARE THE ONE TO PICK UP CLEVER LITTLE STORIES
BUT I LIKE REAL EXCITING NOVELS
FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY SHE HAD THOUGHT HER LOVE FOR SYDNEY VERY ROMANTIC BECAUSE SHE DID NOT REALLY CARE WHETHER HE WAS RICH OR POOR THOUGH SHE NEVER DARED TO SAY SO EVEN TO POLLY FOR FEAR OF BEING LAUGHED AT
AND HAVING WORKED HIS WAY UP ONCE HE FEELS AS IF HE COULD AGAIN
LITTLE THINGS CHAPTER 5
YOU MUST N'T MIND MY STARING DEAR SAID MADAM SOFTLY PINCHING HER ROSY CHEEK
HE HAD KNOWN HER SINCE HER FIRST VISIT AND HAD ALWAYS LIKED THE CHILD
FOR FANNY FORGETFUL OF HER YOUNG-LADYISM AND HER SIXTEEN YEARS HAD BOXED TOM'S EARS AND TOM RESENTING THE INSULT HAD FORCIBLY SEATED HER IN THE COAL-HOD WHERE HE HELD HER WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT WITH THE OTHER
BUT WON'T IT TAKE A LONG TIME TOM ONLY A FEW YEARS AND WE NEED N'T WAIT A MINUTE AFTER SYD IS PAID IF YOU DON'T MIND BEGINNING RATHER LOW DOWN POLLY I D RATHER WORK UP WITH YOU THAN SIT IDLE WHILE YOU TOIL AWAY ALL ALONE
THEY ARE SO STIFF AND DON'T CARE TO DANCE WITH ME
SHE LIKED IT HOWEVER AS MUCH AS SHE DID THE SOBER EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE AND THE WAY HE HAD LATELY OF SWINGING HIS ARMS ABOUT AS IF HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ENERGETIC WITH THEM
VERY DISTANT
THEN WE STARTED AGAIN BUT WERE SOON STOPPED BY A GREAT SHOUTING AND THERE WAS WILL RACING DOWN THE HILL WAVING A PILLOW IN ONE HAND AND A SQUASH PIE IN THE OTHER
I M GLAD YOU TAKE IT SO WELL DEAR
HE WAS N'T TIPSY
PRESENTLY MR SHAW STEADIED HIMSELF AND ASKED WHERE IS MY OTHER DAUGHTER WHERE S MY POLLY SHE WAS THERE AT ONCE
I KNOW I VE MADE A GUY OF MYSELF
DO YOU LIKE IT SHE ASKED AFTER A FEW STROKES OVER THE HOT FOREHEAD WHICH SHE THOUGHT WAS FEVERED BY INTENSE APPLICATION TO GREEK AND LATIN
CONTENTS CHAPTER 1
DEAR HEART HOW WELL I REMEMBER PLAYING IN AUNT'S GREAT GARDEN AND CHASING JACK UP AND DOWN THOSE WINDING STAIRS
THE OLD-FASHIONED THINGS HAD BEEN LET WITH THE HOUSE AND NOW SEEMED ALMOST LIKE A GIFT FROM GRANDMA DOUBLY PRECIOUS IN THESE TROUBLOUS TIMES
I M LAZY AND CROSS AND IT WILL DO ME GOOD SAID POLLY SITTING DOWN WITH THE RESIGNED FEELING
SALLY HAD BEEN BRIBED BY PROMISES OF AS MANY GOODIES AS SHE COULD EAT AND BEING A REGULAR MADCAP SHE WAS READY FOR ANYTHING
LET S GET OUT
PUT YOUR PRIDE IN YOUR POCKETS AND REMEMBER POVERTY IS N'T DISGRACEFUL BUT DISHONESTY IS POLLY HAD ALWAYS LOVED KIND MR SHAW BUT NOW SHE RESPECTED HIM HEARTILY AND FELT THAT SHE HAD NOT DONE HIM JUSTICE WHEN SHE SOMETIMES THOUGHT THAT HE ONLY CARED FOR MAKING MONEY
THAT WAS ONLY A SLIGHT ABERRATION OF HIS
BEFORE SHE COULD CONTINUE IN CAME FANNY WITH THE JOYFUL NEWS THAT CLARA BIRD HAD INVITED THEM BOTH TO GO TO THE THEATRE WITH HER THAT VERY EVENING AND WOULD CALL FOR THEM AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
FANNY FORWARDED HER BITS OF NEWS TO POLLY
SHE STARTED EARLY TO HER FIRST LESSON THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE TIME TO BUY THE TICKETS HOPING AS SHE PUT A FIVE-DOLLAR BILL INTO HER PURSE THAT THEY WOULD N'T BE VERY HIGH FOR SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A MOOD TO RESIST TEMPTATION
HOW S FAN
I LL TAKE CARE OF YOU AND FIX YOU UP SO YOU WON'T LOOK ODD AM I ODD ASKED POLLY STRUCK BY THE WORD AND HOPING IT DID N'T MEAN ANYTHING VERY BAD
I VE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR YOU
UNCLE HANCOCK A SWEET MAN MY DEARS THOUGH SOME CALL HIM MEAN NOW-A-DAYS WAS DEAD AND AUNT HAD MARRIED CAPTAIN SCOTT
WELL YOU COME TO TEA AND WE LL DRESS TOGETHER AND GO ALL COMFORTABLE WITH TOM WHO IS IN A HEAVENLY FRAME OF MIND TO-DAY I MUST RUN HOME AND GET MY THINGS SAID POLLY RESOLVING ON THE SPOT TO BUY THE NICEST PAIR OF GLOVES THE CITY AFFORDED
YOU LET ME MANAGE IT AND DON'T FEEL ANY SHAME OR ANXIETY ABOUT IT
JUST ONE BIT MORE WHISPERED FANNY TURNING ON A PAGE OR TWO AND STOPPING AT A LEAF THAT WAS BLURRED HERE AND THERE AS IF TEARS HAD DROPPED ON IT
TWO LITTLE THINGS HAD HAPPENED THAT DAY AND THE INFLUENCE OF A FEW WORDS A CARELESS ACTION WAS STILL WORKING IN THE ACTIVE MINDS OF THE GIRLS
ALL BUT MR SYDNEY
NEITHER IS MY BONNET FOR WHICH I M DEEPLY GRATEFUL SAID POLLY WHO HAD BEEN EXAMINING IT WITH A SOLICITUDE WHICH MADE TOM'S EYES TWINKLE
THEY WERE GIRLS STILL FULL OF SPIRITS FUN AND YOUTH
COME OUT AND HAVE AN ICE WE SHALL HAVE TIME FAN IS SO ABSORBED I COULD N'T THINK OF DISTURBING HER SAID POLLY FANCYING THAT HER FRIEND WAS ENJOYING THE EVENING AS MUCH AS SHE WAS A GREAT MISTAKE BY THE WAY FOR FAN WAS ACTING FOR EFFECT AND THOUGH SHE LONGED TO TURN AND JOIN THEM WOULD N'T DO IT UNLESS A CERTAIN PERSON SHOWED SIGNS OF MISSING HER
THAT EYE-GLASS WAS HER ESPECIAL AVERSION FOR TRIX WAS NO MORE NEAR-SIGHTED THAN HERSELF BUT PRETENDED TO BE BECAUSE IT WAS THE FASHION AND AT TIMES USED THE INNOCENT GLASS AS A WEAPON WITH WHICH TO PUT DOWN ANY ONE WHO PRESUMED TO SET THEMSELVES UP
IN SOME THE PLUMS ARE ALL ON THE TOP AND WE EAT THEM GAYLY TILL WE SUDDENLY FIND THEY ARE GONE
BUT IT MEANT A GOOD DEAL FOR THE VOICES WERE KIND AND THE EYES MET FULL OF THAT AFFECTION WHICH MAKES WORDS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE
EAT AWAY POLLY AND MY MEN WILL BE BACK WITH SUPPLIES IN A JIFFY SUCH FUN AS THEY HAD IN THAT CLOSET
SHE STOPPED AT SIGHT OF POLLY STARED A MINUTE THEN TOOK UP HER ROAR JUST WHERE SHE LEFT IT AND CAST HERSELF INTO FANNY'S LAP EXCLAIMING WRATHFULLY TOM S LAUGHING AT ME
TOM KEPT WISHING TRIX WAS HALF AS SATISFACTORY AS POLLY AND MR SYDNEY BEGAN TO BUILD CASTLES THAT HAD NO FOUNDATION
COME ON THEN
WELL YOU ARE MISTAKEN AND THE NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING PLEASE ASK STRAIGHT OUT
TOM WHISTLED A MINUTE THEN SIGHED DEEPLY AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FOREHEAD WHICH THE BLACK PLASTER STILL ADORNED
I D RATHER BE MARRIED AND HAVE A HOME OF MY OWN
IT SEEMS QUEER AT FIRST
NOW THIS WON'T DO SHE BROKE OUT ALL AT ONCE
THIS WILL HELP JENNY VERY MUCH
HOW DO YOU MEAN WHY SUPPOSE FAN OR BETTER STILL YOU GO AND SORT OF PAVE THE WAY
THE PARTS SEEMED REVERSED NOW AND IT WAS POLLY WHO GAVE FANNY WHO RECEIVED
WHY YOU VE NO IDEA HOW MUCH GOODNESS AND SUNSHINE YOU CAN GET OUT OF THE MOST UNPROMISING THINGS IF YOU MAKE THE BEST OF THEM I DON'T KNOW HOW SAID FAN DESPONDENTLY
SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL I M WILLING BUT YOU MUST LET ME SEE THE LETTER
HE BROODED OVER THIS A GOOD DEAL FOR LIKE THE BAT IN THE FABLE HE DID N'T SEEM TO FIND ANY PLACE IN THE NEW LIFE WHICH HAD BEGUN FOR ALL
HE FELT ITS WORTH EVEN WHILE HE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH THE SENSE OF JUSTICE THAT IS STRONG IN MANLY MEN HOW LITTLE HE DESERVED A GIFT WHICH HE HAD SO MISUSED
IS IT TRUE FAN AND POLLY TURNED TO HER FRIEND WITH A FACE FULL OF SURPRISE WHILE TOM STRUCK AN IMPOSING ATTITUDE AND AFFECTED ABSENCE OF MIND
LET GO MY JACKET AND DON'T BOTHER OR I LL CUT AWAY ALTOGETHER GROWLED TOM DAUNTED BY THE AWFUL PROSPECT OF OPENING THE BALL WITH POLLY
POLLY WAS VERY QUIET AFTER THAT AND THE MINUTE DINNER WAS OVER SHE LEFT THE ROOM TO GO AND HAVE A QUIET THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE MATTER
REBECCA JEFFREY IS A REGULARLY SPLENDID GIRL FULL OF TALENT
I VE HAD A GOOD MANY AT THE TOP ALREADY YOU KNOW ANSWERED TOM WATCHING THE OPERATION WITH AS MUCH INTEREST AS IF HE HAD FAITH IN THE OMEN
SO GO ON WITH YOUR WORK AND LET US LAZY ONES LOOK ON AND ADMIRE AS POLLY SPOKE BOTH GIRLS LOOKED UP AND NODDED SMILINGLY
WHY NOT I SHOULD N'T ENJOY THEM IF I DID N'T HAVE A FINE DRESS AND DANCE ALL THE TIME AND BE ADMIRED AND ALL THE REST OF IT I DID N'T KNOW YOU CARED FOR SUCH THINGS CRIED FANNY SURPRISED
THEY ALL WENT ABOUT THEIR OWN AFFAIRS
IT DID THEM ALL GOOD FOR MUSIC IS A BEAUTIFUL MAGICIAN AND FEW CAN RESIST ITS POWER
DARE SAY PEOPLE THINK SO
THE RAVAGES COMMITTED BY THIS BAD BOY ARE BEYOND THE POWER OF LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE AS HE REVELLED IN THE INTERESTING DRAWERS BOXES AND CASES WHICH HELD HIS SISTER'S TREASURES
HE S BEEN VERY KIND TO US ALL AND LATELY HE HAS SEEMED TO LIKE TO SEE ME ALWAYS WHEN HE COMES AND MISS ME IF I M GONE
DON'T WORRY CHILD
LET HER FIND COMFORT IN BIBS AND DUST-PANS IF SHE CAN WHISPERED POLLY TO FAN WHILE MAUD TOOK A JOYFUL HEADER AMONG THE PILLOWS AND CAME UP SMILING AND BLOWZY FOR SHE LOVED HOUSE-WORK AND OFTEN GOT LECTURED FOR STOLEN VISITS TO THE KITCHEN AND SURREPTITIOUS SWEEPINGS AND DUSTINGS WHEN THE COAST WAS CLEAR
WHERE SHOULD SHE BEGIN
DO YOU ALWAYS ASKED HER FRIEND LEANING FORWARD WITH AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO WIN BACK THE OLD-TIME LOVE AND CONFIDENCE TOO PRECIOUS TO BE EXCHANGED FOR A LITTLE BRIEF EXCITEMENT OR THE BARREN HONOR OF BAGGING A BIRD TO USE TRIX'S ELEGANT EXPRESSION
BUT HER FRANK FACE BETRAYED HER FOR FANNY TURNED ON HER SUDDENLY SAYING YOU MAY AS WELL FREE YOUR MIND POLLY FOR I SEE BY YOUR EYES THAT SOMETHING DON'T SUIT I WAS ONLY THINKING OF WHAT GRANDMA ONCE SAID THAT MODESTY HAD GONE OUT OF FASHION ANSWERED POLLY GLANCING AT THE WAIST OF HER FRIEND'S DRESS WHICH CONSISTED OF A BELT A BIT OF LACE AND A PAIR OF SHOULDER STRAPS
SHE PUTS ON THAT DASHING AIR BEFORE PEOPLE TO HIDE HER REAL SELF
I HOPE SO MURMURED POLLY WONDERING WHAT WAS COMING NEXT
READING THAT TRIX HAD GIVEN TOM BACK HIS FREEDOM CHANGED MANY THINGS TO POLLY AND CAUSED HER TO SHRINK FROM HIS CONFIDENCE BECAUSE SHE FELT AS IF IT WOULD BE HARDER NOW TO KEEP SELF OUT OF SIGHT
SLIGHTLY GASPED TOM IN WHOSE WARDROBE AT COLLEGE THOSE IDENTICAL TROUSERS WERE HANGING AT THAT MOMENT
BEFORE LONG TOM AND POLLY WERE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE ENJOYING THE BLISSFUL STATE OF MIND WHICH USUALLY FOLLOWS THE FIRST STEP OUT OF OUR WORK-A-DAY WORLD INTO THE GLORIFIED REGION WHEREIN LOVERS RAPTUROUSLY EXIST FOR A MONTH OR TWO
PLAY AWAY WAS THE GRACIOUS REPLY AS TOM SHUT HIS EYES AND LAY SO STILL THAT MAUD WAS CHARMED AT THE SUCCESS OF HER ATTEMPT
HE S PAID UP SO OFTEN THAT THE LAST TIME HE SAID HIS PATIENCE COULD N'T STAND IT NOR HIS POCKET EITHER AND IF I GOT INTO ANY MORE SCRAPES OF THAT SORT I MUST GET OUT AS I COULD
EVERY NIGHT WE ARRANGED PIT-FALLS FOR THE ROBBERS AND ALL FILED UP TO BED BEARING PLATE MONEY WEAPONS AND THINGS TO BARRICADE WITH AS IF WE LIVED IN WAR TIMES
I DON'T CARE IF HE IS
IF WE ARE GOING TO THE OPERA TO-NIGHT PERHAPS WE D BETTER START AS THE CARRIAGE HAS BEEN WAITING SOME TIME OBSERVED FAN COOLLY AND SAILED OUT OF THE ROOM IN AN UNUSUALLY LOFTY MANNER
BUT IT SO HAPPENED HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN ALONE TILL NOW AND THAT WAS WHY IT CUT SO DEEPLY ESPECIALLY AS POLLY NEVER HAD APPROVED OF TRIX
I NEVER HAVE ANY MONEY SOMEHOW IT WON'T STAY WITH ME BUT I CAN'T LET THE PLATE PASS ME THIS TIME WHEN FANNY BROUGHT THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO POLLY SHE JUST GATHERED IT UP IN HER TWO HANDS WITH SUCH A GLAD GRATEFUL FACE THE GIRLS WISHED THEY HAD HAD MORE TO GIVE
I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD N'T BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN I DARE SAY HE DON'T CARE A FIG FOR HER AND YOU ARE ONLY BORROWING TROUBLE
DUN NO WAS TOM'S BRIEF REPLY FOR HE WAS JUST ESCAPING FROM AN ALLIGATOR OF THE LARGEST SIZE
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW EXACTLY
SHERRY AND SPIDER ADORNED THE REFRIGERATOR
FOR WITH HER ECONOMY DOES N'T MEAN SCRIMPING IN ONE PLACE TO MAKE A SHOW IN ANOTHER
MOTHER FITTED ME OUT WITH SUCH A SUPPLY I M GLAD TO HAVE A PARTY FOR I CAN'T EAT IT ALL QUICK ENOUGH
AND MY BLESSED FATHER IN HIS PLUM-COLORED COAT AND KNEE BUCKLES AND THE QUEUE I USED TO TIE UP FOR HIM EVERY DAY HANDING AUNT IN TO DINNER LOOKING SO DIGNIFIED AND SPLENDID GRANDMA SEEMED TO FORGET HER STORY FOR A MINUTE AND BECOME A LITTLE GIRL AGAIN AMONG THE PLAYMATES DEAD AND GONE SO MANY YEARS
HE OCCASIONALLY REFRESHED HIMSELF BY TEASING HER TO SEE HOW SHE D STAND IT AND CAUSED POLLY MUCH ANGUISH OF SPIRIT FOR SHE NEVER KNEW WHERE HE WOULD TAKE HER NEXT
EVERY ONE WILL KNOW TO-MORROW
PUT IT ON AND LET S SEE I WOULD N'T FOR THE WORLD WITH MY HAIR ALL TUMBLING DOWN
OH OH OH
HOW AM I GOING TO KNOW THE CREATURE
BUT PERHAPS IT WOULD BE SAFER IF I GOT OUT AND SAT WITH THE MAN AND TOM QUITE BEAMED WITH THE BRILLIANCY OF THIS SUDDEN MODE OF RELIEF
AS SHE RECLAIMED HER BOOK AND BAG AT HER OWN DOOR SHE SAID IN HER HONEST WAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TRYING TO MAKE ME FORGET MY FOOLISH LITTLE TROUBLES THEN LET ME SAY ONE THING MORE
GOOD-NIGHT SWEET MISTRESS MILTON AS SYD CALLED YOU
I VE LOST IT AND NOW THERE LL BE THE DICKENS TO PAY
DEBBY WILL HEAR AND SPOIL ALL THE FUN
DON'T YOU WISH YOU WERE A CHILD AND DARED TELL WHAT YOU WANT MURMURED FANNY
YES I CAN SHE ADDED A MINUTE AFTER IT S POLLY'S HOLIDAY
WAS N'T IT DREADFUL AWFUL AND TOM EXPLODED INTO A GREAT LAUGH THAT MADE FANNY COVER HER EARS AND THE LITTLE DOG BARK WILDLY
SO WHY SHOULD N'T I AND POLLY LOOKED AT HER SIMPLE BLUE MERINO FROCK STOUT BOOTS AND SHORT HAIR WITH A PUZZLED AIR
BUT THE TUB WAS A NEW ARRANGEMENT WHICH SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT
WHAT AN OLD DEAR CRIED BELLE
SOMEBODY MUST HOLD HIS HEAD HE ADDED AS HE THREADED HIS QUEER LITTLE NEEDLE
I SAID ONCE I D LIKE THAT BUT I M AFRAID I SHOULD N'T FOR I CAN'T BEAR INDIAN CAKE AND COLD POTATOES THAT S WHAT THE POOR CHILDREN ALWAYS SEEM TO GET AND I SHOULD HATE TO HAVE GRACE AND THE REST SEE ME SCUFFING ROUND THE BACK GATES MY LITTLE GIRL SHALL NEVER COME TO THAT IF I CAN HELP IT SAID MR SHAW HOLDING HER CLOSE WITH A LOOK THAT MADE MAUD ADD AS SHE LAID HER CHEEK AGAINST HIS OWN BUT I D DO IT FATHER IF YOU ASKED ME TO FOR I TRULY WANT TO HELP SO DO I CRIED FANNY WONDERING AT THE SAME MINUTE HOW IT WOULD SEEM TO WEAR TURNED SILKS AND CLEAN HER GLOVES
HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU GET THE DAVENPORTS AND THE GREYS MY DEAR SAID MRS SHAW SITTING ERECT IN HER SURPRISE
AND MAUD GAVE THEM ONE HEARTY PEAL THAT DID A WORLD OF GOOD BY PENSIVELY REMARKING WHEN THE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE HAD BEEN EXPLAINED TO HER I M SO RELIEVED
THIS FROLIC PUT EVERY ONE IN SUCH SPIRITS THAT POLLY FORGOT HER TROUBLE AND THE LITTLE GIRLS KISSED EACH OTHER GOOD-NIGHT AS AFFECTIONATELY AS IF SUCH THINGS AS IMPORTED FROCKS COUPS AND RIVAL BROTHERS DID N'T EXIST WELL POLLY DO YOU LIKE PARTIES ASKED FAN WHEN THE LAST GUEST WAS GONE
FOR AFTER A SURPRISED LOOK SHE LAUGHED IN HIS FACE AND TOOK HIM BY THE HAND SAYING HEARTILY OF COURSE YOU MAY
GET A-TOP OF YOUR TROUBLES AND THEN THEY ARE HALF CURED MISS MILLS SAYS EVERYTHING IS SO CONTRARY AND PROVOKING SAID FANNY PETULANTLY
BUT I DON'T MEAN TO COAST ANY MORE
BUT SHE DON'T SIT THERE ALL THE TIME
BETSEY IS QUITE AS STYLISH AND EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN PERKY AND SHE KNOWS IT WHICH IS AN AGGRAVATION POLLY COULD N'T HELP LAUGHING BUT GREW SOBER A MINUTE AFTER AS TRIX SAID PETTISHLY WELL I M SICK OF HEARING ABOUT BEGGARS
I JUST WISH YOU COULD HAVE HEARD THEM GO ON LAST TIME
I ONLY PUT IT IN LAST SPRING BECAUSE I DID N'T DARE TO ASK FOR ONE OF THE NEW ONES
WOULD IT BE VERY IMPROPER TO CHANGE MY MIND AND POLLY LOOKED UP AT HER TALL PARTNER WITH EYE WHICH PLAINLY SHOWED THAT THE CHANGE WAS A SACRIFICE
I FEEL QUITE BLASE ALREADY
POLLY WENT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD BUT SHE WORE A CURIOUSLY ANXIOUS LOOK AND STOPPED ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE DEN AS IF A LITTLE AFRAID OF ITS OCCUPANT
GOING ABOUT DOING GOOD IN PONY PHAETONS AS SOMEBODY SAYS MAY SUCCEED IN ENGLAND BUT IT WON'T WORK HERE SAID FANNY WHO HAD BEGUN LATELY TO THINK A GOOD DEAL OF SOME ONE BESIDE HERSELF AND SO FOUND HER INTEREST IN HER FELLOW-BEINGS INCREASING DAILY
FANNY'S FRIENDS DID NOT INTEREST HER MUCH
AND I M THE LAST SEVENTY NEXT BIRTHDAY MY DEAR AND NOT WORN OUT YET
NOW THEN GRANDMA I REMEMBER ONE OF JACK'S PRANKS WHEN THAT WAS USED WITH GREAT EFFECT SAID GRANDMA AFTER A THOUGHTFUL PAUSE DURING WHICH TOM TEASED THE GIRLS BY SNAPPING THE LOCK OF THE PISTOL IN THEIR FACES
OH POLLY YOU DO TELL SUCH INTERESTING THINGS SIGHED MAUD WIPING HER EYES
YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE WAS THE PLACID REPLY
HOW WE DID LAUGH WHEN HE CAME UP AND EXPLAINED THAT OUR NEIGHBOR OLD MRS DODD HAD SENT IN A HOP-PILLOW FOR ME IN CASE OF HEADACHE AND A PIE TO BEGIN HOUSEKEEPING WITH
BUT HOW SHALL WE LEARN THAT
THERE IS A GOOD DEAL MORE OF THIS SORT OF SILENT SUFFERING THAN THE WORLD SUSPECTS FOR THE WOMEN WHO DARE ARE FEW THE WOMEN WHO STAND AND WAIT ARE MANY
SO PRESENTLY THE GIRLS WERE HARD AT IT POLLY VERY HUMBLE AND DOWNCAST FANNY EXCITED AND OVERFLOWING WITH CURIOSITY AND DELIGHT
I M SO INTERESTED AND I KNOW SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED I HEAR IT IN YOUR VOICE FOR I CAN'T SEE YOUR FACE DO YOU REMEMBER THE TALK WE ONCE HAD AFTER READING ONE OF MISS EDGEWORTH'S STORIES ABOUT NOT LETTING ONE'S LOVERS COME TO A DECLARATION IF ONE DID N'T LOVE THEM YES AND YOU GIRLS SAID IT WAS N'T PROPER AND I SAID IT WAS HONEST ANYWAY
THEN SHE ADDED IN A CHANGED TONE
I CAN'T DRESS MUCH NOW YOU KNOW CAUSE MAMMA'S IN BLACK FOR SOMEBODY OBSERVED MISS ALICE LOVETT FEELING THE IMPORTANCE WHICH AFFLICTION CONFERRED UPON HER WHEN IT TOOK THE FORM OF A JET NECKLACE
SISTERS NEVER DO AS WE FELLOWS KNOW TOO WELL
REALLY MY SISTER
THERE WAS NO ANSWER TO HER QUESTION BUT SHE WAS SATISFIED AND PUTTING HER ARM ROUND HER FRIEND SHE SAID IN HER MOST PERSUASIVE TONE MY PRECIOUS POLLY DO I KNOW HIM YOU HAVE SEEN HIM AND IS HE VERY WISE GOOD AND SPLENDID DEAR NO HE OUGHT TO BE IF YOU LOVE HIM
SEVERAL OF THE MORE FROLICSOME WERE IMITATING THE GRECIAN BEND SOME WERE PUTTING THEIR HEADS TOGETHER OVER LITTLE NOTES NEARLY ALL WERE EATING CONFECTIONERY AND THE ENTIRE TWELVE CHATTERED LIKE MAGPIES
SO SHE IS ACTUALLY GOING TO EARN HER OWN LIVING AND HAND OVER HER SHARE OF THE FAMILY INCOME TO WILL
EVERY ONE FLEW UP BRISKLY
AND MAUD AND HE LIVED TOGETHER LIKE A CAT AND DOG WHO DID NOT BELONG TO A HAPPY FAMILY GRANDMA WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO STOOD BY POOR OLD TOM
FOR WHEN HE CEASED TO BE A HARUM-SCARUM BOY MRS SHAW BEGAN TO TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN HER SON AND HE MISSING GRANDMA TRIED TO FILL HER PLACE WITH HIS FEEBLE MOTHER
NOBODY SEEMED TO CARE MUCH FOR PLAIN PUG-NOSED LITTLE MAUDIE
POOR OLD FATHER IF I D ONLY KNOWN AND TO POLLY'S UTTER DISMAY TOM THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR AND LAID HIS HEAD DOWN ON THE TABLE AS IF HE HAD GOT A BLOW THAT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM
NOTHING BUT A CURTAIN FLAPPING OR A SHADDER FOR THE POOR DEARS IS SLEEPING LIKE LAMBS WE HEARD HER SAY THIS TO HERSELF AND A GENERAL TITTER AGITATED THE WHITE COVERLETS AS SHE DEPARTED
THERE PUT ON THAT APRON TO KEEP YOU TIDY SIT HERE AND TAKE IT EASY I USED TO HELP GRANDMA BAT UP CAKE AND RATHER LIKED IT IF I REMEMBER RIGHT SAID TOM LETTING POLLY TIE A CHECKED APRON ON HIM PUT A BIG BOWL INTO HIS HANDS AND SETTLE HIM NEAR THE TABLE WHERE MAUD WAS PICKING RAISINS AND SHE HERSELF STIRRING BUSILY ABOUT AMONG SPICE-BOXES ROLLING-PINS AND BUTTER-POTS
HER MOTHER WANTS HER TO BEGIN AND DESIRED ME TO MAKE THE INQUIRY DID SHE REALLY AND POLLY LOOKED UP AT HIM AS IF SHE SUSPECTED HIM OF INVENTING THE WHOLE THING OUT OF KINDNESS
THERE I FEEL BETTER
BUT EVERY ONE OF THE BIDDIES IS BETTER FOR BEING THERE WHETHER THEY ARE GRATEFUL OR NOT
THIS IS THE MOST DELICIOUS PARTY I EVER WENT TO OBSERVED MAUD WITH HER MOUTH FULL OF HONEY WHEN THE FEAST WAS WELL UNDER WAY
NOW THE DRESSES CONTINUED POLLY WHO HAD RAPIDLY SORTED OUT THE PILES
AND WHENEVER HER FATHER SPOKE OF SENDING HER AGAIN OR GETTING A GOVERNESS SHE WAS SEIZED WITH BAD HEADACHES A PAIN IN HER BACK OR WEAKNESS OF THE EYES AT WHICH MR SHAW LAUGHED BUT LET HER HOLIDAY GO ON
BUT I PICKED MYSELF UP IN A MINUTE FOR I WAS USED TO SUCH TUMBLES
NOW A BIT OF PINK RIBBON TO TIE IT WITH AND I SHALL BE DONE IN TIME TO DO UP MY BEST COLLAR SHE SAID TURNING HER BOXES TOPSY-TURVY FOR THE NECESSARY RIBBON IN THAT DELIGHTFUL FLURRY WHICH YOUNG LADIES FEEL ON SUCH OCCASIONS
YOU D HAVE WHISKED ROUND THE CORNER WHEN YOU SAW ME COMING OR HAVE STARED STRAIGHT BEFORE YOU UTTERLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE BAGGAGE WAGON POLLY LAUGHED IN HIS FACE JUST AS SHE USED TO DO WHEN SHE SAID THAT AND IN SPITE OF THE DOUBT CAST UPON HIS COURTESY TOM RATHER LIKED IT THOUGH HE HAD NOTHING TO SAY FOR HIMSELF BUT A REPROACHFUL NOW POLLY THAT S TOO BAD TRUE NEVERTHELESS
SHE SAID THAT WAS THE VERY REASON WHY SHE SHOULD N'T DO IT
BUT HE S THE HORRIDEST ONE I EVER SAW FANNY WENT TO A FASHIONABLE SCHOOL WHERE THE YOUNG LADIES WERE SO BUSY WITH THEIR FRENCH GERMAN AND ITALIAN THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR GOOD ENGLISH
NOW THEN CATCH HOLD GIRLS AND TOM PROCEEDED TO DELIVER THE NOSEGAYS WITH AS MUCH GRACE AS COULD BE EXPECTED FROM A YOUTH IN A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES AND VERY TIGHT BOOTS
THE WAY INTO MY PARLOR IS UP A WINDING STAIR SANG POLLY RUNNING UP TWO FLIGHTS OF BROAD OLD-FASHIONED STEPS AND OPENING THE DOOR OF A BACK ROOM OUT OF WHICH STREAMED THE WELCOME GLOW OF FIRELIGHT
BEING LATE SHE OF COURSE FORGOT HER MUSIC AND HURRYING BACK FOR IT FELL INTO A PUDDLE WHICH CAPPED THE CLIMAX OF HER DESPAIR
IT NEEDS A STRONG HAND AND MINE ARE TIRED
AND TOM WAS SEIZED WITH A SUDDEN DESIRE TO IMITATE THIS BOY WHO HAD N'T DONE ANYTHING WONDERFUL YET WAS SO DEAR TO HIS SISTER THAT SHE CRIED FOR HIM A WHOLE YEAR AFTER HE WAS DEAD
WHY DON'T HE SHOW IT THEN MUTTERED TOM WITH A HALF-WISTFUL HALF-DEFIANT GLANCE TOWARD THE LIBRARY DOOR WHICH STOOD AJAR
THEN THERE S ANOTHER THING WE CAN DO ADDED POLLY WARMING UP
BEFORE SHE COULD CLEAR HER EYES OR STEADY HER FACE A GENTLEMAN MET HER LIFTED HIS HAT SMILED AND SAID PLEASANTLY GOOD MORNING MISS POLLY I M GLAD TO MEET YOU THEN WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE OF VOICE AND MANNER HE ADDED I BEG PARDON IS ANYTHING THE MATTER CAN I BE OF SERVICE IT WAS VERY AWKWARD BUT IT COULD N'T BE HELPED AND ALL POLLY COULD DO WAS TO TELL THE TRUTH AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT
NELLY THOUGHT I WAS KILLED AND BEGAN TO CRY WITH HER MOUTH FULL
AND POLLY MORE THAN ONCE DISCOVERED HIM DOING SOMETHING KIND FOR MADAM AND SEEMING VERY MUCH ASHAMED WHEN IT WAS FOUND OUT
NO NO MY DEAR FAR FROM IT I CALL THAT A TIP-TOP STORY
MR SHAW WENT OUT MRS SHAW RETIRED TO HER ROOM ESCORTED BY MAUD AND THE TWO GIRLS SAT TOGETHER WONDERING IF ANYTHING DREADFUL HAD HAPPENED
AHEM SAID WILL LOUDLY
FEELING IN A DARING MOOD SHE RELEASED HER PRETTY HAIR FROM THE BRAIDS IN WHICH SHE USUALLY WORE IT AND PERMITTED THE CURLS TO DISPLAY THEMSELVES IN ALL THEIR BROWN ABUNDANCE ESPECIALLY SEVERAL DANGEROUS LITTLE ONES ABOUT THE TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
I WORE MY GREEN AND WHITE PALMYRINE MY HAIR BOWED HIGH THE BEAUTIFUL LEG-O'-MUTTON SLEEVES THAT WERE SO BECOMING AND THESE VERY GLOVES
THE CITY BELLS RUNG ONE AND POLLY STARTED UP
MISS POLLY WOULD LET CONCEALMENT PREY ON HER DAMASK CHEEKS AND STILL SMILE ON IN THE NOVEL FASHION OR TURN SISTER OF CHARITY AND NURSE THE HEARTLESS LOVER THROUGH SMALL-POX OR SOME OTHER CONTAGIOUS DISEASE AND DIE SERAPHICALLY LEAVING HIM TO THE AGONIES OF REMORSE AND TARDY LOVE POLLY GAVE SYDNEY AN INDIGNANT LOOK AS HE SAID THAT IN A SLOW SATIRICAL WAY THAT NETTLED HER VERY MUCH FOR SHE HATED TO BE THOUGHT SENTIMENTAL
I WOULD N'T SAY SUCH THINGS FOR IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO EITHER OF YOU THE OTHER ONE WOULD FEEL SO SORRY
BUT HOW DO YOU EVER GET INTO IT ANSWERED POLLY SURVEYING WITH GIRLISH INTEREST THE CLOUD OF PINK AND WHITE LACE THAT LAY UPON THE BED
WHERE IS SHE NOW ASKED POLLY TOUCHED TO THE HEART BY THE STORY SO SIMPLE YET SO SAD
SO DON'T GET IN A PASSION WITH THOSE POOR FELLOWS AND I LL SEE THAT THEY BEHAVE BETTER NEXT TIME
WHO HAVE YOU GOT FOR PUPILS ASKED MRS SHAW FORGETTING HER NERVES FOR A MINUTE
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS WERE EQUALLY OUT OF HIS LINE AND THE GIRLS MORE FRANK THAN THEIR FATHER DID NOT HESITATE TO TELL HIM HE WAS IN THE WAY WHEN HE OFFERED TO LEND A HAND ANYWHERE
WALK HOME WITH ME AND SEE MY FUNNY LITTLE ROOM
SO THE GIRLS LET HER ALONE BEING CIVIL WHEN THEY MET BUT EVIDENTLY FEELING THAT SHE WAS TOO ODD TO BELONG TO THEIR SET
I HOPE YOU LL BE VERY HAPPY TOM AND POLLY SHOOK HIS HANDS WITH A SMILE THAT WAS MORE PATHETIC THAN A FLOOD OF TEARS
SHE HAD OFTEN LONGED TO DO IT FOR BEING BROUGHT UP IN THE MOST AFFECTIONATE AND FRANK RELATIONS WITH HER BROTHERS SHE HAD EARLY LEARNED WHAT IT TAKES MOST WOMEN SOME TIME TO DISCOVER THAT SEX DOES NOT MAKE NEARLY AS MUCH DIFFERENCE IN HEARTS AND SOULS AS WE FANCY
I DON'T SEE MUCH FUN IN THESE COLD RUNS YOU ARE SO FOND OF TAKING SAID FANNY WITH A YAWN AND A SHIVER
WHERE IS THE POOR FELLOW I LL BRING HIM AND POLLY DEPARTED WITH MOST OBLIGING ALACRITY
PRICES ARE HIGH BUT YOU FORGET HOW MUCH MORE IT COSTS TO LIVE NOW THAN IT USED TO DO
ONE GETS PALE AND OLD AND SADLY FAGGED OUT WITH ALL THIS DISSIPATION PLEASANT AS IT IS
GOOD NIGHT
I WISH YOU WERE AND YOU WOULD BE POLLY IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH A RESOLUTE THING
NOW POLLY DON'T YOU BE SHY
BUT I DON'T NOW FOR HER FATHER AND MOTHER DON'T TAKE CARE OF HER AS MINE DO OF ME
I THINK MR SHAW UNDERSTOOD THE REAL MEANING OF THAT LITTLE ACT OF RESPECT AND FELT BETTER FOR THE HOPEFUL CHANGE IT SEEMED TO FORETELL
BUT I CAN'T FIND THE BOTTLE AND DON'T WANT TO DISTURB MAMMA IT S IN MY CLOSET
JOVE
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A GIFT FOR PUTTING A GOOD DEAL OF BOTH ARTICLES INTO YOUR OWN AND OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES WHICH IS LUCKY AS WE ALL HAVE TO EAT THAT SORT OF CAKE WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT OBSERVED TOM SO SOBERLY THAT POLLY OPENED HER EYES AND MAUD EXCLAIMED I DO BELIEVE HE S PREACHING FEEL AS IF I COULD SOMETIMES CONTINUED TOM
IT WON'T BE SO WITH US FOR PAPA MEANS TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING AND NOT HAVE A WORD SAID AGAINST HIM
I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF THERE REALLY WAS A MAN NAMED SIR PHILIP IN THE TIME OF QUEEN ELIZABETH YOU MEAN SIR PHILIP SIDNEY
WOULD YOU MIND SITTING IN HER CHAIR AND LETTING ME TELL YOU TWO OR THREE THINGS AS WILL DOES MIND IT
FANNY CAME UP SOMETIMES TO TEACH THEM A NEW DANCING STEP AND MORE THAN ONCE WAS BETRAYED INTO A GAME OF ROMPS FOR WHICH SHE WAS NONE THE WORSE
YOU DO KNOW NOW
I LL GO TO HER AND POLLY WHISKED OUT OF THE CLOSET AS SUDDENLY AS SHE HAD WHISKED IN LEAVING TOM SITTING ON THE BOOT-JACK WITH A RADIANT COUNTENANCE
BUT YOU HAVE LIVED IN THE COUNTRY AND HAVE N'T YET LEARNED THAT MODESTY HAS GONE OUT OF FASHION AND WITH A GOOD-NIGHT KISS GRANDMA LEFT POLLY TO DREAM DREADFULLY OF DANCING IN JOCKEY COSTUME ON A GREAT STAGE
I CAME TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING WITH YOURSELF LATELY
WELL SHE WAS SO PLEASED WITH THE GRAPES YOU BROUGHT HER I THOUGHT I D TRY SOMETHING AND MAYBE SHE D SAY THANK YOU DARLING TO ME TOO
THEN FALLING INTO A SAD SWEET STRAIN SHE SANG THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS POLLY DID N'T KNOW WHY SHE CHOSE IT BUT THE INSTINCT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN A TRUE ONE FOR OLD AS THE SONG WAS IT WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HEARTS OF THE HEARERS AND POLLY SUNG IT BETTER THAN SHE EVER HAD BEFORE FOR NOW THE MEMORY OF LITTLE JANE LENT IT A TENDER PATHOS WHICH NO ART COULD GIVE
COME BOTH OF YOU AND HAVE A FROLIC AS WE USED TO SAID POLLY FOR THE RED SUNSET NOW BURNING IN THE WEST SEEMED TO INVITE THEM OUT
I M RUSHING MADLY INTO EXPENSE I M AFRAID BUT THE FIT IS ON ME AND I LL EAT BREAD AND WATER FOR A WEEK TO MAKE UP FOR IT
HAVE YOU AN HOUR TO SPARE FOR MY LITTLE NIECE
HOW DOES HE BEAR IT TOM LIKE A MAN POLLY
BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ME TO GO TO MANY ANSWERED POLLY SLOWLY
SO YOU SHALL
THE PUTTING ON OF THE RESCUED COLLAR AND CUFFS WAS A TASK WHICH ABSORBED HER WHOLE MIND
HE DOES DANCE LIKE AN ANGEL AS TRIX SAYS PAPA I WISH YOU D COME AND WALTZ WITH ME
HE SENT UP SOME BOOKS ONE DAY AND WILL TEASED HER ABOUT IT WHAT DID SHE DO DEMANDED FANNY
SHE CAN'T HAVE RUN AWAY HOME CAN SHE HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE PAUSED BEFORE THE HAT-TREE
YOU KNOW YOU ARE FORBIDDEN TO GO GALLIVANTING ROUND WITH THOSE CHAPS AND THAT S THE REASON YOU RE IN A PUCKER NOW
YOUNG TEACHERS DOING MUCH WORK FOR LITTLE PAY
BUT TO KEEP UP A DAILY SACRIFICE OF ONE'S WISHES TASTES AND PLEASURES IS RATHER A HARD TASK ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE IS PRETTY YOUNG AND GAY
WELL IT S POLLY AS HE SPOKE TOM STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS TO HER WITH THE SORT OF MUTE ELOQUENCE THAT CANNOT BE RESISTED AND POLLY WENT STRAIGHT INTO THEM WITHOUT A WORD
I SHOULD N'T BE SURPRISED TO HEAR OF HER PREACHING IN THE JAIL ADOPTING A NICE DIRTY LITTLE ORPHAN OR PASSING ROUND TRACTS AT A WOMAN'S RIGHTS MEETING SAID TRIX WHO NEVER COULD FORGIVE BELLE FOR HAVING A LOVELY COMPLEXION AND SO MUCH HAIR OF HER OWN THAT SHE NEVER PATRONIZED EITHER RATS MICE WATERFALLS SWITCHES OR PUFF-COMBS
POLLY POINTS TO THE RIGHT KEY WITH A LITTLE STICK AND PUTTEL SITS ON THE STOOL AND PATS EACH KEY AS IT S TOUCHED AND IT MAKES A TUNE
FOR SOMEHOW THAT NAUGHTY THING CALLED ENVY TOOK POSSESSION OF HER AND SPOILED HER PLEASURE
HE WENT DOWN BUT NOT INTO THE PARLOR FOR SOMEHOW THE JOKE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ITS RELISH
THAT WILL PLEASE MISS MILLS BEST
POLLY WAS FUMBLING FOR HER HANDKERCHIEF AND WITHOUT A WORD HE TOOK BOTH BOOK AND BUNDLE FROM HER A LITTLE BIT OF KINDNESS THAT MEANT A GOOD DEAL JUST THEN
THERE I TOLD YOU MY DOINGS WOULD NOT INTEREST YOU AND THEY DON'T
SING SOME MORE DEAR SAID MADAM IN HER GENTLE WAY WHEN SHE HAD DONE
WELL IF I CAN'T BE HAPPY I CAN BE USEFUL PERHAPS THANK YOU MY DEAR
I THINK IT WOULD BE IF WE KNEW HOW TO LOOK AT AND FEEL IT SAID POLLY VERY QUIETLY AS SHE PUSHED HER CHAIR OUT OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE OF MISS PERKINS INTO THE TEMPERATE ONE OF FRIENDLY EMMA
BUT MY MUFF IS SO BIG I WON'T CARRY IT
JUST AS POLLY RAN DOWN TO MEET MR SHAW ONE EVENING AND WAS HELPING HIM OFF WITH HIS COAT THE BELL RANG AND A FINE BOUQUET OF HOTHOUSE FLOWERS WAS LEFT IN POLLY'S HANDS FOR SHE NEVER COULD LEARN CITY WAYS AND OPENED THE DOOR HERSELF
MAUD SHOWED US A BOOK SHE FOUND AND WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT THE PICTURES BEGAN FANNY DROPPING IT AS IF IT BURNT HER FINGERS
HE PICKED UP MY MUFF WHEN IT TUMBLED DOWN AND TOOK CARE OF ME IN THE CROWD
I LAMED HIM LAST WINTER AND THE BEGGAR WON'T GET OVER IT AND THAT DID N'T PAY UP THE DEBTS ONLY ABOUT A HALF OF EM WHY TOM HOW MUCH DO YOU OWE I HAVE DODGED FIGURING IT UP TILL YESTERDAY
BUT MARIE IS FRENCHIFIED AND SILLY I SPELL MY OWN NAME WITH AN IE AND SO DO ALL THE GIRLS AND WHAT A JUMBLE OF NETTIES NELLIES HATTIES AND SALLIES THERE IS
THEY ARE LOVELY
BE QUIET
I REALLY MUST BREAK OUT SOMEWHERE AND HAVE A GOOD TIME
THEY ALWAYS SUIT YOUNG GIRLS SAID MRS SHAW PRIVATELY THINKING THAT HER OWN DAUGHTERS LOOKED MUCH THE BEST YET CONSCIOUS THAT BLOOMING POLLY HAD THE MOST ATTRACTIVE FACE
THEN I SHALL WAIT AND POLLY'S FACE CHANGED SO BEAUTIFULLY THAT FAN HUGGED HER ON THE SPOT FERVENTLY WISHING THAT MARIA BAILEY NEVER HAD BEEN BORN
IF IT IS TRUE ABOUT MARIA WHAT SHALL WE DO SAID FANNY AFTER A PAUSE
THAT S THE WAY TO HELP PEOPLE HELP THEMSELVES AND MISS MILLS CLASHED HER BIG SCISSORS ENERGETICALLY AS SHE CUT OUT A LITTLE RED FLANNEL SHIRT
WE ARE TOO OLD FOR SUCH THINGS NOW I DON'T THINK PEOPLE EVER ARE TOO OLD TO KISS THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS WAS THE QUICK ANSWER
TOM'S SUCCESS AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL CHAPTER I
BUT I COULD N'T KEEP AWAY ANY LONGER SO I RAN UP TO SAY HOW DO YOU DO ANSWERED POLLY IN THE CHEERY VOICE THAT DID ONE'S HEART GOOD TO HEAR
YOU DID N'T AND FANNY DROPPED HER FORK WITH A SCANDALIZED FACE
THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TWO WILL AMUSE YOU I THINK AFTER A LITTLE SEARCH GRANDMA PRODUCED AN OLD PORTFOLIO AND SELECTING THE PAPERS READ THE FOLLOWING LETTER WRITTEN BY ANNE BOLEYN BEFORE HER MARRIAGE TO HENRY VIII AND NOW IN THE POSSESSION OF A CELEBRATED ANTIQUARIAN
SHE DID NOT MEAN TO FLIRT BUT SOMEHOW IT FLIRTED ITSELF AND SHE COULD N'T HELP IT FOR ONCE STARTED IT WAS HARD TO STOP WITH TOM GOADING HER ON AND SYDNEY LOOKING AT HER WITH THAT NEW INTEREST IN HIS EYES
WELL I HATE COWARDS I AIN'T A COWARD YES YOU ARE
I LL TRY IT AND SEE FOR SHE STANDS BY ME LIKE A TRUMP
BECKY AND BESS HOW DO YOU DO
I ALWAYS NEED THEM AND PAPA LOOKS SOBER WHEN I WANT MONEY THERE WAS A MINUTE'S PAUSE AS FAN RETURNED TO HER PRACTISING AND TOM RELAPSED INTO THE REVERIE HE WAS ENJOYING SEATED ASTRIDE OF A CHAIR WITH HIS CHIN ON HIS FOLDED ARMS
ONLY WILLY BLISS SPILT IT ON MY NEW GABWIELLE AND MAUD WAILED AGAIN OVER HER ACCUMULATED WOES
BUT NOT MUCH I FANCY AND FAN LOOKED AS IF STRUNG UP TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING SHE POSSESSED
OR SHE WENT INSIDE TO WATCH THE BOYS COASTING AND TO WISH SHE COULD COAST TOO AS SHE DID AT HOME
ARE N'T WE SILLY HE DID NOT SEEM TO THINK SO AND AFTER A SHORT PAUSE FOR REFRESHMENTS POLLY TURNED SERIOUS AND SAID ANXIOUSLY WHEN MUST YOU GO BACK TO YOUR HARD WORK IN A WEEK OR TWO
IT S VERY STEEP HERE
I M SO AFRAID I SHOULD GET TIRED OF HIM AND THEN WHAT SHOULD I DO
THERE LL BE A FUSS IF I GO AND FAN WILL PLAGUE ME
SEATING HIMSELF HE SURVEYED THE GIRLS AS IF WELL SATISFIED WITH THE SUCCESS OF HIS PRANK AND WAITING TO BE CONGRATULATED UPON IT
AND OFTEN WHEN SHE SAW HOW BIG HER EYES WERE GETTING AND HOW PLAINLY THE VEINS ON HER TEMPLES SHOWED INDULGED THE PENSIVE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS SPRING DANDELIONS MIGHT BLOSSOM O'ER HER GRAVE
BECKY AND SHE LIVE TOGETHER AND TAKE CARE OF ONE ANOTHER IN TRUE DAMON AND PYTHIAS STYLE
I M IN A DEVIL OF A MESS THANK YOU
I WAS THINKING ABOUT JIMMY WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ABOUT HIM
LORD SURREY AND LORD LEICESTER SOUND FINE BUT HOT COCKLES AND RED MITTENS AND SHOES FOR THREE SHILLINGS ARE HORRID I LIKE IT SAID POLLY THOUGHTFULLY AND I M GLAD POOR ANNE HAD A LITTLE FUN BEFORE HER TROUBLES BEGAN
CLARA TRIED ARSENIC FOR HER COMPLEXION BUT HER MOTHER STOPPED IT SAID FANNY BETRAYING THE SECRETS OF THE PRISON-HOUSE IN THE BASEST MANNER
BUT THAT S NOT THE QUESTION
AND HERSELF ADDED POLLY
I THINK IT WAS DOWNRIGHT JOLLY
I LL ONLY INTRODUCE TWO OR THREE OF THE GIRLS
TRIX TREATS TOM SHAMEFULLY AND HE BEARS IT LIKE A LAMB
FOR MAUD INHERITED THE NOTABLE GIFTS OF HER GRANDMOTHER AND WOULD HAVE MADE A CAPITAL FARMER'S DAUGHTER IN SPITE OF HER CITY BREEDING
I DON'T BEAR MALICE BUT HOPE SHE LL DO BETTER AND NOT BE DISAPPOINTED AGAIN UPON MY WORD I DO THAT S VERY GOOD OF YOU QUITE SYDNEYESQUE AND NOBLE SAID POLLY FEELING RATHER ILL AT EASE AND WISHING SHE COULD HIDE HERSELF BEHIND A CAP AND SPECTACLES IF SHE WAS TO PLAY GRANDMA TO THIS CONFIDING YOUTH
BUT I DARE SAY IT S NOTHING TIME WILL SHOW THEN FAN BEGAN TO SING AND TOM'S HORSE CAME SO HE DEPARTED WITH THE VERY UNUSUAL DEMONSTRATION OF A GENTLE PAT ON THE HEAD AS HE SAID KINDLY THAT S RIGHT MY DEAR KEEP JOLLY IT WAS N'T AN ELEGANT WAY OF EXPRESSING SYMPATHY BUT IT WAS HEARTY AND FAN THANKED HIM FOR IT THOUGH SHE ONLY SAID DON'T BREAK YOUR NECK TOMMY WHEN HE WAS GONE FAN'S SONG ENDED AS SUDDENLY AS IT BEGAN AND SHE SAT THINKING WITH VARYING EXPRESSIONS OF DOUBT AND TROUBLE PASSING RAPIDLY ACROSS HER FACE
DID N'T YOUR MOTHER EVER LET YOU WEAR THE NICE THINGS THAT CAME ASKED MAUD
SNIP EVIDENTLY REGARDING IT AS A GAME GOT UP FOR HIS SPECIAL BENEFIT ENJOYED THE RACE IMMENSELY AND SCAMPERED ALL OVER THE HOUSE SHAKING THE PRECIOUS PARCEL LIKE A RAT WHILE HIS MASTER RAN AND WHISTLED COMMANDED AND COAXED IN VAIN
I FANCY SOME FRUIT OFF OUR OWN TREES WOULD SUIT ME FOR I HAVE NO APPETITE AND MAMMA IS QUITE DESOLATE ABOUT ME
THIS FACT RESTORED HIS EQUANIMITY
ONE STOOD BEFORE A GREAT CLAY FIGURE IN A CORNER
EVERY ONE TURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO WELCOME IT AND EVERY ONE CRIED OUT WHY POLLY FOR THERE ON THE THRESHOLD STOOD A BRIGHT-FACED GIRL SMILING AS IF THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS NOVEMBER WEATHER IN THE WORLD
TOM LOOKED MUCH ABASHED AND SAID NOT A WORD
AND TOM EMPTIED HIS PLATE INTO THE FOAMY SYRUP WHILE THE OTHERS WATCHED WITH DEEP INTEREST THE MYSTERIOUS CONCOCTION OF THIS WELL-BELOVED SWEETMEAT
WHEN DRESSED THE THREE GIRLS WENT UP TO SHOW THEMSELVES TO THE ELDERS WHO WERE IN GRANDMA'S ROOM WHERE TOM WAS BEING HELPED INTO AN AGONIZINGLY STIFF COLLAR
THANK YOU SIR SAID POLLY GRATEFULLY AND NODDED AT TOM WHO TELEGRAPHED BACK ALL RIGHT AND FELL UPON HIS DINNER WITH THE APPETITE OF A YOUNG WOLF
HULLO AND TOM SAT UP TO TAKE A SURVEY
GRANDMA WHERE S POLLY ASKED FAN ONE SNOWY AFTERNOON AS SHE CAME INTO THE DINING-ROOM WHERE TOM WAS REPOSING ON THE SOFA WITH HIS BOOTS IN THE AIR ABSORBED IN ONE OF THOSE DELIGHTFUL BOOKS IN WHICH BOYS ARE CAST AWAY ON DESERT ISLANDS WHERE EVERY KNOWN FRUIT VEGETABLE AND FLOWER IS IN ITS PRIME ALL THE YEAR ROUND
HOW TOM COULD HELP ADORING YOU I DON'T SEE
IF HE DOES N'T TAKE THAT HINT I WILL GIVE HIM A STRONGER ONE FOR I WILL NOT HAVE MATTERS COME TO A CRISIS THOUGH I CAN'T DENY THAT MY WICKED VANITY STRONGLY TEMPTS ME TO TRY AND BAG A BIRD JUST FOR THE EXCITEMENT AND CREDIT OF THE THING
WHO ELSE SHOULD IT BE HE DID N'T SAY YOU TALKED ABOUT HER MOST AND SO WE THOUGHT STAMMERED POLLY FALLING INTO A SUDDEN FLUTTER
A TIME AS PRECIOUS AND IMPORTANT TO THE AFTER-LIFE AS THE HOUR WHEN THE APPLE BLOSSOMS FALL AND THE YOUNG FRUIT WAITS FOR THE ELEMENTS TO RIPEN OR DESTROY THE HARVEST
I SAW YOU WHAT HAS THE GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS TO DO WITH US ASKED POLLY TRYING TO LOOK AS IF SHE MEANT WHAT SHE SAID
AND MAUD ANNOUNCED SOON AFTER THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO FWEDDY CAUSE HAWRY SLAPPED HER WHEN SHE PROPOSED THE MATCH
POLLY UNDERSTOOD NOW AND PUT HER FEAR AT REST BY SAYING ALMOST PASSIONATELY I TELL YOU I DON'T LOVE HIM
SUPPOSE SHE LL WEAR A TOP-KNOT AND A THINGUMBOB LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE
WAIT A BIT AND I LL ADD MY SHARE CRIED POLLY AND CATCHING UP HER CLOAK SHE RAN OFF TO THE GROCERY STORE NEAR BY
HOW THE DEUCE SHOULD A MAN LOOK THEN CRIED TOM RATHER NETTLED AT HER SOBER RECEPTION OF THE GRAND NEWS
DRESS THAT GIRL UP AND SHE D BE A RAVING TEARING BEAUTY ADDED TOM TO MAUD IN A LOWER TONE AS HE LOOK HER INTO THE PARLOR UNDER HIS ARM
I M MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR COMING TO TAKE CARE OF ME IT WAS KIND OF POLLY TO SAY THAT AND TOM FELT IT
DO ANY OF YOU WISH TO TAKE ARTICLES HOME TO DO AT ODD TIMES SAID FAN WHO WAS PRESIDENT OF THIS ENERGETIC DORCAS SOCIETY
THAT I GUESS HE WILL FOR HE IS N'T HALF AS THOUGHTLESS AS HE MAKES HIMSELF OUT SAID POLLY LOOKING ACROSS AT TOM WITH SUCH FRIENDLY EYES THAT HE WAS QUITE TOUCHED THOUGH OF COURSE HE DID N'T SHOW IT
STAND BY ME POLLY
SHE WOULD N'T HAVE BELIEVED IT OF TOM
BUT WHEN ANOTHER SET APPEARED IN A COSTUME CONSISTING OF GAUZE WINGS AND A BIT OF GOLD FRINGE ROUND THE WAIST POOR UNFASHIONABLE POLLY DID N'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
I AIN'T ASHAMED FOR IT KEEPS MAUD HAPPY AND WILL PLEASE MY SISTER KITTY
DON'T YOU THINK THESE BROAD SHOULDERS CAN BEAR BURDENS WITHOUT BREAKING DOWN THESE HANDS WORK WELL THESE EYES SEE CLEARLY AND THESE LIPS DO SOMETHING BESIDES SIMPER AND GOSSIP FANNY WAS SILENT
THE FACES GREW MORE EARNEST THE FINGERS FLEW FASTER AS THE QUICK YOUNG HEARTS AND BRAINS TOOK IN THE NEW FACTS IDEAS AND PLANS THAT GREW OUT OF THE TRUE STORIES THE SENSIBLE HINTS THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS WHICH POLLY TOLD THEM FRESH FROM THE LIPS OF MISS MILLS
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE GIRL I VE LOVED FOR MORE THAN A YEAR
I GET SO TIRED OF THE OTHER FELLOWS THEY ARE SUCH ABSURD THINGS AND WHEN TOM IS IN HIS GOOD MOOD HE IS VERY NICE AND QUITE REFRESHING I M GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID POLLY MAKING A MENTAL NOTE OF THE FACT
BUT WHEN I WAS MAKING MY PLAN I KNEW I MUST HAVE A GOOD NAME OR TWO TO SET ME GOING SO I JUST WROTE AND ASKED MRS D
POLLY COULD N'T DISTINGUISH A WORD SO SHE KEPT HER SEAT WONDERING ANXIOUSLY WHAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN THE TWO MEN
I HATE DANCING
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME DEAR SHE ASKED LOOKING AT POLLY'S FEVERISH CHEEKS AND EXCITED EYES
SOME OF US AT LEAST
POLLY SAT DOWN LOOKING BOTH SATISFIED AND TROUBLED
HULLO POLLY
I CAN'T GET USED TO IT THAT S BECAUSE YOU VE MORE COMMON-SENSE THAN ROMANCE
BUT POLLY WAS USED TO HIM NOW AND NOTHING DAUNTED TOOK A LOOK AT THE GRIMY PAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH TOM HAD STUCK
WILL YOU POLLY
WE SHALL PULL THROUGH CHILDREN SO DON'T BORROW TROUBLE ONLY BE READY FOR DISCOMFORTS AND ANNOYANCES
SHE REGARDED THE NEW ABODE AS A BABY HOUSE ON A LARGE SCALE WHERE SHE WAS ALLOWED TO PLAY HER PART IN THE MOST SATISFACTORY MANNER
I SHOULD THINK YOU D BE ASHAMED TO PLAY WITH DOLLS POLLY
SHE LIKES TO HAVE ME AND I ENJOY SEEING THE PRETTY THINGS
I THINK SIR PHILIP WAS HIT HARDER THAN WAS SUPPOSED SAID FAN
THAT WAS DROLL
GONE TO NEW YORK FOR A WEEK AH WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY THE MICE WILL PLAY EXACTLY
WELL NO I THINK IT WILL PROBABLY BE A LECTURE ANSWERED POLLY LAUGHING FOR JENNY'S GRATEFUL SERVICE AND AFFECTIONATE EYES CONFIRMED THE PURPOSE WHICH MISS MILLS LITTLE HOMILY HAD SUGGESTED
BUT I WON'T HAVE ANY IE PUT ON TO MY NAME
FOR NO WINE WAS ALLOWED AND THE GALLANT BAND WERE SO BUSY SKIRMISHING TO SUPPLY THE LADIES THAT THEY HAD NOT TIME TO EAT TOO MUCH
AND CANADA IS NO JOKE IN WINTER TIME LET ME TELL YOU AS HE SPOKE MR SHAW STROKED HIS SULKY DAUGHTER'S CHEEK HOPING TO SEE SOME SIGN OF REGRET
NOW I M COMING TO THE POINT WHERE I SPECIALLY WANT YOUR ADVICE POLLY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THIS IS MY FRIEND FANNY SHAW
GOT UPSET DID N'T I HE ASKED PRESENTLY EYEING THE PROSTRATE VELOCIPEDE WITH MORE ANXIETY ABOUT ITS DAMAGES THAN HIS OWN
CARRIE RAN AWAY WITH AN ITALIAN MUSIC-TEACHER AND IT GOT INTO THE PAPERS AND MADE A GREAT STIR EXPLAINED THE FIRST SPEAKER TO POLLY WHO LOOKED MYSTIFIED
YOU LL KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU SEE HIM BETTER THAN I CAN TELL YOU ANSWERED POLLY READILY YIELDING FOR SHE KNEW THEY CONSIDERED HER QUITE ONE OF THE FAMILY AS TOM SAID
I D LIKE TO SEE ANYBODY WATCHING AND GUARDING ME ADDED ANOTHER DASHING YOUNG LADY
I D LIKE TO TRAVEL
HE DON'T WANT ME
EVERYBODY WHO KNEW THEM HASTENED TO CALL MANY FROM A REAL REGARD BUT MORE FROM MERE CURIOSITY TO SEE HOW THEY TOOK IT THIS WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS THEY HAD TO BEAR AND TOM USED STRONG LANGUAGE MORE THAN ONCE WHEN SOME FINE LADY CAME TO CONDOLE AND WENT AWAY TO GOSSIP
BUT TOM GOT OUT AND KEPT HIM IN ORDER SO I WAS N'T MUCH FRIGHTENED ANSWERED INNOCENT POLLY TAKING OFF HER ROUGH-AND-READY COAT AND THE PLAIN HAT WITHOUT A BIT OF A FEATHER
HER SON WENT UP EVERY EVENING FOR A LITTLE CALL WAS VERY KIND TO HER AND SAW THAT SHE WANTED NOTHING MONEY COULD BUY
SUCH A FLURRY AS WE WERE IN
THE TRAIN WAS JUST IN WHEN HE REACHED THE STATION PANTING LIKE A RACE-HORSE AND AS RED AS A LOBSTER WITH THE WIND AND THE RUN
I LL GIVE HER THE DRESS AND NOT TAKE A PENNY FOR IT CRIED FAN FLUSHING UP WITH MINGLED ANGER TOWARD TRIX AND GRATITUDE TO BELLE
WAIT AND SEE RETORTED BELLE RESOLVING THAT IT SHOULD LAST JUST TO DISAPPOINT THAT SPITEFUL MINX AS SHE SWEETLY CALLED HER OLD SCHOOL-MATE
AT LAST A BLACK MARK WAS FOUND UPON OUR DOOR AND A GREAT PANIC ENSUED FOR WE FELT THAT NOW OUR TIME HAD COME
LEST ANY OF MY YOUNG READERS WHO HAVE HONORED MAUD WITH THEIR INTEREST SHOULD SUFFER THE PANGS OF UNSATISFIED CURIOSITY AS TO HER FUTURE I WILL ADD FOR THEIR BENEFIT THAT SHE DID NOT MARRY WILL BUT REMAINED A BUSY LIVELY SPINSTER ALL HER DAYS AND KEPT HOUSE FOR HER FATHER IN THE MOST DELIGHTFUL MANNER
THEN HE DREW UP AN ARM-CHAIR AND BECKONING POLLY TO TAKE IT SAID IN A SOBER STEADY TONE THAT SURPRISED HER GREATLY WHENEVER I WAS IN A QUANDARY I USED TO GO AND CONSULT GRANDMA AND SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING SENSIBLE OR COMFORTABLE TO SAY TO ME
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER WAS HANGING OUT OF THE WINDOW WITH A FLOCK OF GIRLS WATCHING THE CARRIAGE ROLL AWAY WHILE THE CROWD CHEERED AS IF THEY WERE MAD
NOW THEN
THAT SETTLED THE MATTER
I MADE HIM LAUGH SAID POLLY PENITENTLY
YOU SHAN'T LET HIM UP TILL I M READY
WELL CHOOSE ANYTHING YOU LIKE AND I LL TRY TO REMEMBER A STORY ABOUT IT TOM MADE A RAPID RUMMAGE AND FISHED UP A LITTLE BROKEN PISTOL
ANOTHER SECURED CERTAIN LUXURIOUS ARTICLES FOR MRS SHAW'S COMFORT
I SHALL DO WHAT I CAN FOR HER AMONG MY FRIENDS AND I DARE SAY SHE WILL GET ON VERY WELL WITH YOUNG PUPILS TO BEGIN WITH
FAN LIKES SWEET THINGS AND WE WANT TO BE ELEGANT WHEN WE HAVE COMPANY SAID POLLY FLYING IN AGAIN AND DEPOSITING HER SHARE ON THE TABLE
AND I D GO HOME ONLY IT WOULD SEEM UNGRATEFUL TO MR SHAW AND GRANDMA AND I DO LOVE THEM DEARLY I SAY FAN YOU VE GOT IT NOW
I VE NO DOUBT SHE WOULD FEEL HIGHLY HONORED TO BE ALLOWED TO DEVOTE HER TIME TO YOUR AMUSEMENT
WHEN SHE CAME TO THAT GOOD-BY SHE COULD N'T GET ANY FURTHER BUT COVERED UP HER FACE AND CRIED AS HER HEART WOULD BREAK
I SHOULD N'T HAVE THOUGHT YOU D MIND THINGS LIKE THAT SAID FANNY BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE A GOOD DEAL OF WOMANLINESS EVEN IN A LITTLE GIRL
WELL SHE SHAN'T BE IF I CAN HELP IT
SHE WAS JUST AT THE UNATTRACTIVE FIDGETY AGE WHEN NO ONE KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH HER AND SO LET HER FUMBLE HER WAY UP AS SHE COULD FINDING PLEASURE IN ODD THINGS AND LIVING MUCH ALONE FOR SHE DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE HER SHOULDERS WERE GROWING ROUND AND MRS SHAW WOULD NOT ALLOW HER FIGURE TO BE SPOILED THAT SUITED MAUD EXCELLENTLY
TALK TO ME AND TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOURSELF
TOM WAS OFF TO THE WEST
DOES YOUR HEAD ACHE ASKED POLLY
L
THAT S THE WAY MOTHER DOES
TOM DID N'T NEED ANY URGING TO PLAY ESCORT NOW
OH DEAR SAID POLLY AND TRUDGED ON WONDERING IF HER TURN WOULD EVER COME AND FEARING THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
NEAR-SIGHTED AS SHE WAS THAT RIDICULOUS OBJECT COULD NOT ESCAPE MISS COTTON NEITHER DID THE ORANGE THAT ROLLED OUT FROM THE PILLOW NOR THE BOOTS APPEARING AT THE FOOT OF THE BED
FAN DOES N'T MEAN ANY HARM
THESE WOMEN ARE TAUGHT GOOD HABITS BOOKS ARE PUT WHERE THEY CAN GET THEM SENSIBLE AMUSEMENTS ARE PLANNED FOR THEM SOMETIMES AND THEY SOON FEEL THAT THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERED MERE SCRUBS TO DO AS MUCH WORK AS POSSIBLE FOR AS LITTLE MONEY AS POSSIBLE BUT HELPERS IN THE FAMILY WHO ARE LOVED AND RESPECTED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR FAITHFULNESS
WHO TAKES HER
POLLY FELT A CHANGE IN THE ATMOSPHERE BUT MERELY THOUGHT TOM WAS TIRED SO SHE GRACIOUSLY DISMISSED HIM WITH A STICK OF CINNAMON AS SHE HAD NOTHING ELSE JUST THEN TO LAY UPON THE SHRINE
I LL THINK IT S SO ANYWAY
PUT THE WINTER ONES AWAY TILL AUTUMN RIP UP THE SUMMER ONES AND OUT OF THREE OLD ONES WE LL GET A PRETTY NEW ONE IF MY EYES DON'T DECEIVE ME I LL RIP AND THEN DO LET ME SEE YOU MAKE A BONNET IT MUST BE SO INTERESTING SAID MAUD WHIPPING OUT HER SCISSORS AND EAGERLY BEGINNING TO REDUCE A SHABBY LITTLE BONNET TO ITS ORIGINAL ELEMENTS
THAT WAS VERY PLUCKY POLLY I WAS DREADFULLY AFRAID BUT I REMEMBER I WANTED TO SEEM VERY BRAVE BECAUSE YOU D CALLED ME A COWARD DID I
POLLY SAT WHERE SHE WAS TOLD AND SUFFERED BASHFUL AGONIES AS FAN INTRODUCED VERY FINE YOUNG LADIES AND VERY STIFF YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHO ALL SAID ABOUT THE SAME CIVIL THINGS AND THEN APPEARED TO FORGET ALL ABOUT HER
WILL YOU IT S PRETTY HOT WORK AND IT S A PITY TO WASTE THINGS
FOR BEING FOND OF TURNING SOMERSAULTS THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF INDULGING IN A GOOD ONE METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING WHEN THREE OR FOUR YEARS LATER THEY BECOME THE ABJECT SLAVES OF THOSE BOTHERING GIRLS LOOK HERE
I D RATHER HAVE LESS AND KNOW YOU EARNED IT ALL YOURSELF CRIED POLLY AS TOM STRUCK HIS HAND ON HIS KNEE WITH AN ACUTE PANG OF REGRET AT THE POWER HE HAD LOST
MONEY FASHION AND POSITION WERE LITERALLY NOWHERE
FOR SPITE OF MAIDEN MODESTY LOVE AND HOPE WOULD WAKE AND SING AT THE GOOD NEWS
BUT THEY EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED HER ONLY A QUIET LITTLE THING AND FINDING HER NOT UP TO SOCIETY TALK BLANDLY IGNORED THE PRETTY CHILD AND DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE YOUNG LADIES
NOW SIT DOWN GIRLS AND LET GRANDMA GO ON
WE LL OPEN IT AND GO TO BED AND HE CAN COME OUT WHEN HE LIKES
YES IT IS MUCH WISER AND BETTER FOR ME TO GO TO BED EARLY AND BE READY FOR WORK TOMORROW SHE WOULD LIE AWAKE HEARING THE CARRIAGES ROLL TO AND FRO AND IMAGINING THE GAY GIRLS INSIDE GOING TO PARTY OPERA OR PLAY TILL MRS DODD'S HOP PILLOW MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN STUFFED WITH NETTLES FOR ANY SLEEP IT BROUGHT OR ANY USE IT WAS EXCEPT TO CATCH AND HIDE THE TEARS THAT DROPPED ON IT WHEN POLLY'S HEART WAS VERY FULL
AS YOU MAY IMAGINE TEN YOUNG GIRLS FULL OF SPIRITS AND FUN FOUND THESE RULES HARD TO KEEP AND MADE UP FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR IN PUBLIC BY ALL SORTS OF FROLICS IN PRIVATE
BUT THERE IS N'T MUCH TO TELL BEGAN POLLY GRATEFUL FOR HIS INTEREST
I ADMIRE AND RESPECT THEM AND WANT TO GO AGAIN IF I MAY OH FAN I AM SO GLAD
I M ALL RIGHT SAID POLLY STOUTLY
DON'T YOU POLLY WAS SPARED THE MORTIFICATION OF OWNING THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANY BY THE APPEARANCE OF MONSIEUR A GRAY-HEADED OLD FRENCHMAN WHO WENT THROUGH HIS TASK WITH THE RESIGNED AIR OF ONE WHO WAS USED TO BEING THE VICTIM OF GIGGLING SCHOOL-GIRLS
O MISS MILLS HOW DREADFUL CRIED POLLY WITH HER EYES SO FULL SHE COULD HARDLY READ THE LITTLE LETTER
AT ONE PLACE THE THIEVES HAD A SUPPER AND LEFT HAM AND CAKE IN THE FRONT YARD
NOT ONE IN A HUNDRED WILL EVER THINK ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR DRESS EXCEPT THAT IT IS PRETTY
TOM TOOK IT INTO HIS FOOLISH HEAD THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON AND I FELT A NATURAL INTEREST YOU KNOW TOM
SHE S A MIGHTY TAKING LITTLE BODY AND I M GLAD SHE S TO BE IN TOWN THOUGH I D LIKE IT BETTER IF SHE DID N'T BOTHER ABOUT TEACHING BUT JUST STAYED HERE AND ENJOYED HERSELF SAID TOM LAZILY
THERE S MY DRESS
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT TAILORS AND COLLEGE MATTERS SAID TOM LOOKING AS MUCH CONFUSED AS IF SHE HAD FOUND HIM OUT IN SOMETHING REPREHENSIBLE
FAITH I LL TRY IT AND WHEN TOM HAD LANDED HIS FATHER SAFELY AT THE OFFICE TO THE GREAT EDIFICATION OF ALL BEHOLDERS HE SCREWED UP HIS COURAGE AND WENT TO PREFER HIS REQUEST FEELING THAT THE PROSPECT BRIGHTENED A LITTLE
THEY LIKED A GOOD COUNTRY BREAKFAST AND NOTHING GAVE POLLY MORE SATISFACTION THAN TO SEE HER BIG BOY CLEAR THE DISHES EMPTY THE LITTLE COFFEE-POT AND THEN SIT AND LAUGH AT HER ACROSS THE RAVAGED TABLE
HERE MY KING IS AN ADMIRER OF YOURS FANNY SHAW AND MY WELL BELOVED FRIEND CRIED POLLY PRESENTING FAN WHO REGARDED THE SHABBY YOUNG WOMAN WITH AS MUCH RESPECT AS IF SHE HAD BEEN ARRAYED IN VELVET AND ERMINE
SIX YEARS AFTERWARD CHAPTER 9
OF COURSE
WHAT MISCHIEF ARE YOU UP TO NOW YOU LITTLE MAGPIE I SHAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THEY SAID BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
AS SHE STEPPED IN MEANING TO RUN UP FOR A WORD IF FANNY SHOULD CHANCE TO BE ALONE TWO HATS ON THE HALL TABLE ARRESTED HER
YOU CAN GO TOO IF YOU LIKE
IT MAKES ME WILD JUST TO THINK OF IT
BUT SHE COULD N'T HELP WONDERING WHAT FAN FOUND SO ABSORBING IN AN ACCOUNT OF A RECENT GERMAN AND WHY SHE NEED PROMISE SO SOLEMNLY NOT TO FORGET THE CONCERT THAT AFTERNOON
POPPING MY HEAD OUT OF THE DOOR I LISTENED AND PRESENTLY HEARD A SCRAPING SOUND NEAR THE SHED
HE IS GROWING STOUT AND LOOKS DISSIPATED
DON'T THINK OF THAT BUT REST AND LET US PET YOU
I KNEW IT WAS ALL UP WITH ME SO I DID N'T WAIT TO BE TURNED OUT BUT JUST TOOK MYSELF OFF WHAT WILL YOUR FATHER SAY IT WILL COME HARD ON THE GOVERNOR BUT THE WORST OF IT IS THERE TOM STOPPED AND STOOD A MINUTE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AS IF HE DID N'T FIND IT EASY TO TELL EVEN KIND LITTLE POLLY
MAY I WHISPERED EMMA
YES HORRID COLD
SUNDAY MORNING EARLY
HE DON'T PUT ON AIRS AND TALK NONSENSE
OF COURSE I DO AND HOW WE COASTED ONE DAY ANSWERED TOM LAUGHING
READ THAT MY DEAR AND DON'T THINK HARD OF LITTLE JANE POLLY TOOK THE BIT OF PAPER MISS MILLS GAVE HER AND READ THESE WORDS
MOTHS IN THE FURS A SMOKY CHIMNEY OR SMALL-POX NEXT DOOR ASKED POLLY AS THEY ENTERED FAN'S ROOM WHERE MAUD WAS TRYING ON OLD BONNETS BEFORE THE LOOKING-GLASS
YOUNG THINGS LIKE YOU DON'T NEED ANY ORNAMENTS BUT THOSE YOU WEAR TO-NIGHT YOUTH HEALTH INTELLIGENCE AND MODESTY AS SHE SPOKE GRANDMA GAVE A TENDER KISS THAT MADE POLLY GLOW LIKE A ROSE AND FOR A MINUTE SHE FORGOT THAT THERE WERE SUCH THINGS AS PINK SILK AND CORAL EAR-RINGS IN THE WORLD
AND IF I COULD GET HOLD OF HIM HE SHOULD POLLY CLUTCHED FAN AT THAT AND HELD HER TIGHT SAYING STERNLY IF YOU EVER BREATHE A WORD DROP A HINT LOOK A LOOK THAT WILL TELL HIM OR ANY ONE ELSE ABOUT ME I LL YES AS SURE AS MY NAME IS MARY MILTON I LL PROCLAIM FROM THE HOUSETOPS THAT YOU LIKE AR POLLY GOT NO FURTHER FOR FAN'S HAND WAS ON HER MOUTH AND FAN'S ALARMED VOICE VEHEMENTLY PROTESTED I WON'T
I WONDER IF WE SHALL BE ABLE TO KEEP ONE SERVANT JUST TILL WE LEARN HOW TO DO THE WORK SAID FANNY LOOKING AT HER WHITE HANDS WITH A SIGH
UP IN GRANDMA'S ROOM MAYBE PROVOKING THING
I ONLY KNEW HER AS A PALE SHY YOUNG GIRL WHO WENT IN AND OUT AND SELDOM SPOKE TO ANY ONE
TAKE A TROCHE SAID TOM
THEN THE INDEPENDENCE WILL BE DELIGHTFUL AND IF I CAN SAVE A LITTLE TO HELP KITTY ALONG WITH THAT WILL BE BEST OF ALL POLLY'S FACE SHONE AS IF THE PROSPECT WAS FULL OF PLEASURE INSTEAD OF WORK AND THE HEARTY GOOD WILL WITH WHICH SHE UNDERTOOK THE NEW TASK SEEMED TO DIGNIFY HER HUMBLE HOPES AND PLANS AND MAKE THEM INTERESTING IN THE SIGHT OF OTHERS
JUST TELL HIM I M EXPELLED YOU KNOW AND AS MUCH MORE AS YOU LIKE
THEY ARE NOT FINE OR CEREMONIOUS BUT LIVELY ODD AND PLEASANT
GOING TO DELIVER LECTURES ON WOMAN'S RIGHTS SAID THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINING HIS LUXURIANT CROP OF DECIDEDLY AUBURN HAIR AS HE LOUNGED WITH BOTH ELBOWS ON THE CHIMNEY-PIECE
SHE TALKED MOST AND LOOKED FUNNY AND VERY HAPPY ALL THE TIME
NO I LL LEAVE MOTHER IN PEACE AND FIGHT IT OUT ALONE
POLLY THINKS YOU ARE HANDSOMER THAN MR SYDNEY MUCH OBLIGED I ASKED WHICH SHE THOUGHT HAD THE NICEST FACE AND SHE SAID YOURS WAS THE HANDSOMEST AND HIS THE BEST DOES HE EVER GO THERE ASKED A SHARP VOICE BEHIND THEM
AND THE FIRST MONEY I EVER EARNED WAS FIVE DOLLARS WHICH HE OFFERED AS A PRIZE TO WHICHEVER OF HIS SIX GIRLS WOULD LAY THE HANDSOMEST DARN IN HIS SILK STOCKINGS HOW PROUD YOU MUST HAVE BEEN CRIED POLLY LEANING ON THE OLD LADY'S KNEE WITH AN INTERESTED FACE
SO CLEVER AND ENERGETIC AND KIND AND HAPPY IT ALWAYS DOES ME GOOD TO SEE THEM CRIED POLLY WITH A FACE FULL OF ENTHUSIASM
BUT MR BELL WAS NOT IN A GOOD HUMOR AND ONLY GAVE TOM A SEVERE LECTURE ON THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS WHICH SENT HIM HOME MUCH DEPRESSED AND CAUSED THE HORIZON TO LOWER AGAIN
I HELPED TAKE CARE OF HIM
POLLY WAS MAD HER FACE WAS VERY RED HER EYES VERY BRIGHT AND HER LIPS TWITCHED BUT SHE HELD HER TONGUE AND BEGAN TO SWING AS HARD AS SHE COULD FEARING TO SAY SOMETHING SHE WOULD BE SORRY FOR AFTERWARD
I WISH TO HEAVEN I DID SAID TOM HOLDING OUT HIS HAND WITH A LOOK THAT POLLY THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL TOO GRATEFUL FOR THE LITTLE SHE HAD DONE
ON THE RUG LUXURIOUSLY BASKING IN THE WARMTH LAY A GRAY KITTEN AND CLOSE BY MEDITATIVELY ROOSTING ON ONE LEG STOOD A PLUMP CANARY WHO COCKED HIS BRIGHT EYE AT THE NEW-COMERS GAVE A LOUD CHIRP AS IF TO WAKE HIS COMRADE AND THEN FLEW STRAIGHT TO POLLY'S SHOULDER WHERE HE BROKE INTO A JOYFUL SONG TO WELCOME HIS MISTRESS HOME
POLLY GAVE HIM UP AS A HARD CASE
I MEANT TO BE AS STEADY AS BUNKER HILL MONUMENT
I LIKE TO WATCH PEOPLE EVERYTHING IS SO NEW AND QUEER HERE BUT POLLY DID FEEL AND LOOK VERY SHY WHEN SHE WAS USHERED INTO A ROOM FULL OF YOUNG LADIES AS THEY SEEMED TO HER ALL VERY MUCH DRESSED ALL TALKING TOGETHER AND ALL TURNING TO EXAMINE THE NEW-COMER WITH A COOL STARE WHICH SEEMED TO BE AS MUCH THE FASHION AS EYE-GLASSES
THIS WAS HARD FOR FANNY
I LL GET IT AND TAKING THE LAMP AND JUG TOM DEPARTED BENT ON DOING HIS DUTY NOW LIKE A SAINT
DON'T PLAGUE HER ANY MORE AND SHE WILL BE GOOD TO YOU WHEN YOU GET INTO SCRAPES ANSWERED POLLY WITH HER ARM ROUND FAN
DEAR OLD GRANDMA
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL YOU
BUT IT WORRIED HER TILL SHE REMEMBERED SOMETHING HER MOTHER ONCE SAID TO HER WHEN YOU FEEL OUT OF SORTS TRY TO MAKE SOME ONE ELSE HAPPY AND YOU WILL SOON BE SO YOURSELF I WILL TRY IT THOUGHT POLLY AND LOOKED ROUND TO SEE WHAT SHE COULD DO
FOR POLLY WAS MUCH TOUCHED BY TOM'S MANLY EFFORTS TO DESERVE HER
BUT WE KEPT MAKING RESOLUTIONS AND WORKING HARD TO KEEP EM
AND WHEN THE CANDY IS DONE WE LL LET THE RASCAL OUT HOW CAN WE MAKE IT WITHOUT MOLASSES ASKED POLLY THINKING THAT WOULD SETTLE THE MATTER
AND IF MARGERY HAS KNITTED ME THE CRIMSON WORSTED MITTENS I SHOULD BE GLAD IF THEY WERE SENT UP THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
WILL WOULD N'T COME UP HE WAS SO SNOWY AND FANNY WAS GLAD BECAUSE WITH HER HE WAS BASHFUL AWKWARD AND SILENT SO TOM WENT DOWN AND ENTERTAINED HIM WITH MAUD'S REPORT
AND GRANDMA COCKERED HIM UP WITH EVERY DELICACY SHE COULD INVENT
THE IMAGE OF HER MOTHER A SWEET WOMAN HOW IS SHE DEAR AND KEPT PEERING AT THE NEW-COMER OVER HER GLASSES TILL BETWEEN MADAM AND TOM POOR POLLY LOST HER APPETITE
FOR WHEN THOMAS TOOK MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS HIS SISTER USUALLY SUBMITTED IN SPITE OF HERSELF
AND TOM'S LITTLE FIGURES WHITTLED OUT OF WOOD IN IDLE MINUTES WERE LAID AWAY TO SHOW WILL WHAT COULD BE DONE WITH A KNIFE
DO PUT DOWN THAT STUPID BOOK AND LET S DO SOMETHING SAID FANNY AFTER A LISTLESS STROLL ROUND THE ROOM
WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU ANSWERED POLLY FEELING THAT SOMETHING WAS COMING AND RATHER GLAD TO HAVE IT OVER AND DONE WITH
PERHAPS POLLY HELPED IT A LITTLE
FORBIDDEN FRUIT CHAPTER 13
HE DESERVES THE VERY BEST OF EVERYTHING AND I PRAY THE LORD HE MAY GET IT ADDED TOM POKING THE FIRE IN A DESTRUCTIVE MANNER
IT PASSED THROUGH HER MIND LIKE A FLASH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER LIFE AND THAT OF THE WAN CREATURE LYING BEFORE HER AND SHE FELT AS IF SHE COULD NOT GIVE ENOUGH OUT OF HER ABUNDANCE TO THIS NEEDY LITTLE SISTER WHO HAD NOTHING IN THE WIDE WORLD BUT THE LIFE JUST SAVED TO HER
SHE S EVER SO NICE
BUT SHE DID NOT OR WOULD NOT SEE IT
THERE S PRECIOUS LITTLE MASKING NOWADAYS
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT SAID FANNY HARDLY DARING TO LIFT HER EYES FROM UNDER THE YELLOW TOWER ON HER HEAD
AND AS SURE AS THERE WAS COMPANY TO DINNER HE FIXED HIS ROUND EYES ON HER AND NEVER TOOK THEM OFF TILL SHE WAS REDUCED TO A PITEOUS STATE OF CONFUSION AND DISTRESS
MISS COTTON AND HER BROTHER SAT IN THE BACK PARLOR AFTER SCHOOL WAS OVER AND THE YOUNG LADIES WERE SENT TO BED
SAYS SHE S DYSPEPTIC WHICH MEANS CROSS SHE IS CROSS BUT SHE S SICK TOO FOR I FOUND HER CRYING ONE DAY AND SHE SAID NOBODY CARED ABOUT HER AND SHE MIGHT AS WELL BE DEAD ADDED MAUD HAVING TURNED HER APPLE WITH TENDER CARE
IT WAS RATHER A FAILURE HOWEVER AND AFTER A TOUR OF THE PICTURE SHOPS SHE WENT TO GIVE MAUD A LESSON FEELING THAT IT WAS VERY HARD TO QUENCH HER LONGINGS AND SUBSIDE INTO A PRIM LITTLE MUSIC TEACHER
COME YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TRIUMPHANT DESCENT IF A BIG DOG HAD NOT BOUNCED SUDDENLY THROUGH ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND SENT THE WHOLE CONCERN HELTER-SKELTER INTO THE GUTTER
CAN'T YOU TEASE YOUR MOTHER AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO STAY BEGAN FAN
THERE S NOTHING SO CONVINCING TO BUSINESS MEN AS FACTS YOU KNOW POLLY COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT TOM'S NEW TONE IT SEEMED SO STRANGE TO HEAR HIM TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING BUT HORSES AND TAILORS DANCING AND GIRLS
YES I DID AND LIKED IT EVER SO MUCH ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING ANXIOUS BUT RESOLUTE
HE CALLED HER THE OLD LADY AND TOLD HER HE WOULD N'T BE FUSSED OVER
IF THE GOVERNOR TOOK ANY NOTICE OF ME AND CARED HOW I GOT ON I WOULD N'T MIND THE PRESENTS SO MUCH
DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH A PROVOKING TOAD POLLY
BUT POOR POLLY DID FOR FAN SCOLDED HER TILL POLLY THOUGHT SERIOUSLY OF PACKING UP AND GOING HOME NEXT DAY
I DID WISH SHE D JUST WEAR MY BLUE SET RIBBON IS SO VERY PLAIN
IT S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU VE HIT IT THIS TIME POLLY
SOMEHOW THINGS SEEMED TO GET WORSE AND WORSE AS THE PLAY WENT ON
ONE DAY AN ILL-LOOKING MAN CAME IN AND ASKED FOR FOOD CONTINUED GRANDMA WITH A MYSTERIOUS NOD
NOT MUCH SAID TOM NOT MINDING WHAT HE SAID FOR THE FACT THAT HE WAS SHUT UP WITH THE STRANGE GIRL SUDDENLY OPPRESSED HIS SOUL
BE AS QUIET AS YOU CAN TOM
AND IN THE PAUSES BETWEEN DIFFERENT PIECES MESSRS
WELL SHE MERELY ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT YOU D BE MORTALLY OFFENDED IF SHE OFFERED TO TAKE IT OFF YOUR HANDS AS YOU D NEVER WORN IT
TOM HAS NO MANNERS AT ALL AND YOU DON'T COMPLAIN OF HIM ADDED FAN WITH A LAUGH
DID YOU EVER SEE A PICTURE OF BEAU BRUMMEL ASKED POLLY QUICKLY
WOULD N'T YOU LIKE TO SEE ME DO IT ASKED POLLY PERSUASIVELY HOPING TO BEGUILE THE CROSS CHILD AND FINISH HER OWN WORK AT THE SAME TIME
NED TOLD US ALL ABOUT HER
AND POLLY WAS SO GRATEFUL FOR HIS MANY FAVORS THAT SHE SOON FORGOT HER FEAR AND SHOWED HER AFFECTION IN ALL SORTS OF CONFIDING LITTLE WAYS WHICH PLEASED HIM EXTREMELY
I KNOW IT S CONSIDERED PROPER FOR GIRLS TO SHUT THEIR EYES AND LET THINGS COME TO A CRISIS NO MATTER HOW MUCH MISCHIEF IS DONE
I SHOULD N'T KNOW WHAT TO DO RIGGED UP AS YOU ARE
POLLY DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS WAS WHY HE LEANED DOWN SO OFTEN TO SPEAK TO HER WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND BUT LIKED VERY MUCH NEVERTHELESS
YOU ARE A DEAR TO COME SO EARLY
SHE SEEMED SO DISAPPOINTED AT BEING TOO LATE THAT WILL PROMISED TO GET THEM TO ME IF HE RAN ALL THE WAY TO TOWN
POLLY HAD FORGOTTEN THEM SO THEY BOTH COMMITTED THEM TO MEMORY
I SEE NOW THAT IT IS MY FAULT A GOOD DEAL
I VE HAD A GOOD TIME ANYWAY SHE ADDED GIVING A LITTLE PRANCE IN HER CHAIR
WISH IT WAS N'T SPOILT THEN WE D HAVE FUN POPPING AWAY AT THE CATS IN THE YARD
SHE WOULD N'T TAKE YOU AT ANY PRICE SAID FANNY REMEMBERING POLLY'S LOOK OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND DISAPPROVAL WHEN SHE CAME ON HER LAST VISIT AND FOUND HIM AN UNMISTAKABLE DANDY
BUT POLLY'S EDUCATION HAD BEEN NEGLECTED AND AFTER A GOOD DEAL OF NATURAL INDECISION SHE DID WHAT MOST WOMEN DO IN SUCH CASES THOUGHT SHE WOULD WAIT AND SEE THE DISCOVERY OF FANNY'S SECRET SEEMED TO SHOW HER SOMETHING TO DO FOR IF THE WAIT AND SEE DECISION WAS MAKING HER FRIEND UNHAPPY IT MUST BE CHANGED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
IT IS A DELICATE AND DANGEROUS TASK BUT I GUESS I CAN MANAGE IT
I M GOING DOWN SAID TOM
THE GIRLS TALK ABOUT THINGS I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH AND I DON'T FIND THEIR GOSSIP VERY AMUSING
SHE WON'T DANCE WITH ME HERSELF YET DON'T LIKE ME TO GO IT WITH ANYBODY ELSE
I M OFTEN LONELY FOR THERE ARE NO YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE TO PLAY WITH ME ANSWERED POLLY SMILING HOSPITABLY
I LL HELP YOU TEASE FOR YOUR VELOCIPEDE AND WON'T SAY A WORD AGAINST IT WHEN MAMMA AND GRANNY BEG PAPA NOT TO LET YOU HAVE IT WILL YOU AND TOM PAUSED TO CONSIDER THE OFFER IN ALL ITS BEARINGS
SHE S AS COOL HARD AND WORLDLY MINDED AN OLD SOUL AS I EVER SAW AND TRIX IS BOUND TO OBEY
POLLY TOLD HER WHAT IT WAS ADDING I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO GO AND HELP FANNY BUT I CAN'T SAY I WANT TO
JUST AS HE WAS GROWING KIND TO ME AND I WAS GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME IT S ALL SPOILT BY FAN'S NONSENSE
THE DRESS IS PROPER AND BECOMING AS IT IS AND THE OLD FASHION OF SIMPLICITY THE BEST FOR ALL OF US
AND CONSIDERING THE STYLE OF GIRL HE KNEW MOST ABOUT POLLY QUITE AGREED WITH HIM
WHAT WICKED CREATURES WE ARE
MAUD BEGAN TO WAIL OVER HER LOST DELIGHT AND POLLY GRAVELY POKED AT THE MESS WHICH WAS QUITE SPOILT
BUT HE GOT SOME CHEAP ONES WITH HORRID GREAT STRIPES ON EM AND ALWAYS WORE EM TO THAT PARTICULAR CLASS WHICH WAS ONE TOO MANY FOR THE FELLOWS WILL SAID AND WITH THE REST OF THE MONEY HE HAD A PUNCH PARTY
BOYS OF FOURTEEN ARE APT TO THINK SO AND PERHAPS IT IS A WISE ARRANGEMENT
T IS N'T A BIT LIKE HER THOUGH
I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE ONE HEARTY GIRL IN MY HOUSE INTERRUPTED MR SHAW AND THAT WAS THE END OF IT
SHE S COMING AND TOM BEGAN TO PUMP AS IF THE HOUSE WAS ON FIRE
AND IT WAS WELL FOR HER THAT THE TEMPTATION WAS NOT OFTEN OFFERED
AS SHARP AS A LEMON AND TWICE AS SOUR RETURNED TOM LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH AN AIR OF CALM SUPERIORITY
AND I WAS THINKING PERHAPS PAPA HAD GOT ONE DOWN THERE AND IT KIND OF FRIGHTENED ME MR MERTON'S WAS A BAD DISGRACEFUL FAILURE AND I DON'T WONDER HE HAD A FIT
THE ROGUES CAN'T GO FAR WITHOUT A CLATTER OF SOME SORT AND IF WE COULD ONLY CATCH ONE OF THEM WE SHOULD GET THE REWARD AND A DEAL OF GLORY I SAID TO MYSELF GRASPING MY HATCHET FIRMLY
AND THE CHIEF IDEA OF THEIR LITTLE LIVES SEEMED TO BE TO APE THE FASHIONABLE FOLLIES THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOO INNOCENT TO UNDERSTAND
HERE S YOUR WAGES BRIDGET GOOD LUCK TO YOUR MESSES ANSWERED TOM AS HE WALKED AWAY MEDITATIVELY CRUNCHING HIS CINNAMON AND LOOKING AS IF HE DID NOT FIND IT AS SPICY AS USUAL
YOU WANT A LOCKET DEARY
THE GIRLS CLAPPED THEIR HANDS AND TOM HURRAHED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT SAYING WHEN HE GOT HIS BREATH LAFAYETTE WAS A REGULAR OLD TRUMP
THINK OF THE LUCK OF THAT DEAR SOUL THE ADVANTAGES SHE LL HAVE THE GOOD IT WILL DO HER AND BEST OF ALL THE LOVELY WAY IN WHICH IT COMES TO HER
FANNY GAVE POLLY ONE LOOK THEN WENT AND TOOK THE GRAY HEAD IN BOTH HER ARMS SAYING WITH A TENDER QUIVER IN HER VOICE FATHER DEAR WE VE COME TO HELP YOU BEAR IT MR SHAW LOOKED UP AND SEEING IN HIS DAUGHTER'S FACE SOMETHING THAT NEVER HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE PUT HIS ARM ABOUT HER AND LEANED HIS TIRED HEAD AGAINST HER AS IF WHEN LEAST EXPECTED HE HAD FOUND THE CONSOLATION HE MOST NEEDED
THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS IN WHICH THIS CAN BE DONE THAT I WONDER THEY DON'T SEE AND IMPROVE THEM
NOBODY EVER ACCUSED YOU OF HAVING ANY HEART TO ACHE WITH
SHE DID NOT KNOW IT BUT THAT GOOD OLD FASHION OF SIMPLICITY MADE THE PLAIN GOWNS PRETTY AND THE GRACE OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS BEAUTIFIED THEIR LITTLE WEARER WITH THE CHARM THAT MAKES GIRLHOOD SWEETEST TO THOSE WHO TRULY LOVE AND REVERENCE IT
ANYWAY I LL TAKE A LOOK ROUND THE CORNER EAGER TO GET HIS BOOTS TOM PULLED OPEN THE DOOR OF A DARK CLOSET UNDER THE STAIRS AND NEARLY TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD WITH SURPRISE
I NEVER SAW SUCH A GIRL
YOUR MOTHER S A VERY SENSIBLE WOMAN MY CHILD WHAT A VERY QUEER OLD LADY THOUGHT POLLY
HERE IT IS WITH THE MARK OF A BULLET THROUGH IT FOR HE ALWAYS SAID HIS DOLLY'S CUSHION SAVED HIS LIFE HOW INTERESTING THAT IS CRIED POLLY AS SHE EXAMINED THE FADED CUSHION WITH THE HOLE IN IT
MR SYDNEY HAD CALLED AND WHILE FANNY WAS TALKING WITH HIM SHE SAW HIS EYE REST ON POLLY WHO SAT APART WATCHING THE FACES ROUND HER WITH THE MODEST INTELLIGENT LOOK WHICH MANY FOUND SO ATTRACTIVE
HE MUST HAVE POKED UP THE COVER CLIMBED INTO THE STREET STOLE THE CANDY AND SNEAKED IN AT THE SHED-WINDOW WHILE WE WERE LOOKING FOR IT CATS GOT IT DID N'T THEY JEERED THE VOICE IN A TONE THAT MADE POLLY SIT DOWN AND LAUGH TILL SHE COULD N'T LAUGH ANY LONGER
IF SHE WOULD BE AS SHE WAS WHEN I FIRST KNEW HER I SHOULD LOVE HER JUST THE SAME
POLLY SEEMED TO GUESS AT HER THOUGHTS AS SHE SAW THE CARD AND TURNING TOWARD HER SHE HELD IT UP SAYING WITH A CONSCIOUS LOOK IN HER EYES YOU THOUGHT MR SYDNEY SENT THEM
NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE LUXURIES ALL ABOUT HER ENJOYED THEM WISHED SHE OWNED THEM AND WONDERED WHY THE SHAWS WERE NOT A HAPPIER FAMILY
FOR SHE HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO ME NOTHING SHALL EVER MAKE ME FORGET THAT
IT S HARD ON HIM
NOBODY WANTS YOU TO JUST HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND LET ME MANAGE THEN I D BETTER NOT GO DOWN BEGAN POLLY WHEN A STERN VOICE FROM BELOW CALLED LIKE BLUEBEARD ARE YOU COMING DOWN YES SIR ANSWERED A MEEK VOICE
ANOTHER DIVULGED THE AWFUL FACT THAT CARRIE P.'S WEDDING PRESENTS WERE HALF OF THEM HIRED FOR THE OCCASION
BUT STILL THERE ARE THINGS LEFT UNDONE THAT NATURALLY FALL TO US
SYDNEY STOOD BY HIM TO THE LAST LIKE A MAN AND A BROTHER WHICH EXPRESSION OF TOM'S GAVE FANNY INFINITE SATISFACTION AND WILL FELT ENTIRELY CONSOLED FOR NED'S DISAPPOINTMENT AT HIS REFUSAL TO GO AND JOIN HIM SINCE TOM WAS TO TAKE THE PLACE NED HAD KEPT FOR HIM
GRANDMA PEEPED IN AND SMILED AT THE BUSY GROUP SAYING SEW AWAY MY DEARS
YES AND YOU LIKED EM
TURN OVER A DOZEN PAGES AND TRY AGAIN POLLY OBEYED AND DID EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE SAYING AS SHE LOOKED UP WITH A LAUGH I VE BEEN THROUGH THE WHOLE BOOK
BUT HE LIKED IT BECAUSE IT WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE COQUETTISH CLATTER OF MOST OF THE GIRLS WITH WHOM HE TALKED
WE ALL COMPLAIN ABOUT BAD SERVANTS MOST AS MUCH AS IF WE WERE HOUSE-KEEPERS OURSELVES
I SHOULD BE MORTIFIED TO DEATH IF ANY OF MY FRIENDS SAW YOU ADDED FAN MUCH DISTURBED
THEREFORE WHEN SHE ANNOUNCED HER ENGAGEMENT TOM LOOKED SO STAGGERED FOR A MINUTE THAT FAN THOUGHT HE DID N'T LIKE IT
IT IS THIS SORT OF THING THAT IS IMPROVING POLLY THAT MAKES HER SOCIETY INTERESTING TO SYDNEY AND HERSELF SO DEAR TO EVERY ONE
ODD IS N'T IT HOW PEOPLE LIVE TOGETHER EVER SO LONG AND DON'T SEEM TO FIND ONE ANOTHER OUT TILL SOMETHING COMES TO DO IT FOR THEM
I CAN'T WEAD THE WITING
BUT HE DID N'T CROW OVER HER FAR FROM IT
OF COURSE HE WILL
DON'T LOOK LIKE CITY GIRLS NOR ACT LIKE EM NEITHER HE THOUGHT TRUDGING IN THE REAR AND EYEING WITH FAVOR THE BROWN CURLS BOBBING ALONG IN FRONT
THANK GOODNESS HE S POOR AND CAN'T
HE TRIED THE EFFECT OF EAR-RINGS RIBBONS AND COLLARS
SOME OF IT WAS RATHER QUEER
BUT HE WON'T BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN JILTED ONCE AND HE THINKS IT S SUCH A MEAN THING TO DO PERHAPS SHE LL JILT HIM I VE NO DOUBT SHE WILL IF ANYTHING BETTER COMES ALONG
FAN OPENED HER LIPS TO SAY SOMETHING BUT NOT A SOUND FOLLOWED FOR THERE STOOD POLLY LOOKING AT THEM WITH AN EXPRESSION THEY HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
FANNY LAUGHED AT HIS WANT OF SKILL BUT POLLY WOULD N'T HAVE IT ALTERED AND EVERYBODY FELL TO EATING CAKE AS IF INDIGESTION WAS ONE OF THE LOST ARTS
AND MAUD BROUGHT UP THE REAR IN TEARS BEARING TOM'S CAP
AND WHOSE HANDS NEVER WERE TOO BUSY TOO FULL OR TOO NICE TO WELCOME AND SERVE THE LITTLE SONS AND DAUGHTERS WHO FREELY BROUGHT THEIR SMALL HOPES AND FEARS SINS AND SORROWS TO HER WHO DEALT OUT JUSTICE AND MERCY WITH SUCH WISE LOVE
WHY MUST I WHEN I VE GOT ENOUGH WITHOUT BECAUSE IT S THE FASHION TO HAVE THEM AND YOU CAN'T BE FINISHED OFF PROPERLY WITHOUT
PEOPLE SEEMED TO LIKE IT BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS PROPER AS POLLY FREED HER MIND AND EMPHASIZED HER OPINION WITH A DECIDED RAP OF THE BOOT SHE HAD JUST TAKEN OFF FANNY LAUGHED AND SAID WHILE SHE PIROUETTED ABOUT THE ROOM LIKE MADEMOISELLE THERESE POLLY WAS SHOCKED GRANDMA
YET POLLY RATHER LIKED TOM FOR SHE SOON SAW THAT HE WAS NEGLECTED HUSTLED OUT OF THE WAY AND LEFT TO GET ON PRETTY MUCH BY HIMSELF
SHE MAKES MY SPRING WARDROBE PAPA PAYS THE BILL AND THERE I AM
HOW VERY KIND OF YOU CRIED FANNY WHO HAD NOT DARED TO RECEIVE EVEN A GERANIUM LEAF SINCE THE LATE SCRAPE
BUT WHEN THEY DREW UP BEFORE THE LIGHTED HOUSE AND SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE MIDST OF THE PLEASANT STIR OF FESTIVITY THE COMING AND GOING OF CARRIAGES THE GLIMPSES OF BRIGHT COLORS FORMS AND FACES THE BURSTS OF MUSIC AND A GENERAL ATMOSPHERE OF GAYETY POLLY FELT THAT SHE WAS N'T ALL RIGHT AND AS SHE DROVE AWAY FOR A DULL EVENING IN HER LONELY LITTLE ROOM SHE JUST CRIED AS HEARTILY AS ANY CHILD DENIED A STICK OF CANDY
BUT AND THERE SHE STUCK FOR THE FEAR OF BEING UNGRATEFUL OR UNKIND MADE HER ALMOST HOPE THAT HE WOULD N'T TAKE THE HINT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN CAREFULLY PREPARING FOR HIM
TOM SOON GOT OVER STARING AT POLLY AND AT FIRST DID NOT TAKE MUCH NOTICE OF HER FOR IN HIS OPINION GIRLS DID N'T AMOUNT TO MUCH ANYWAY
WHERE S POLLY ASKED MAUD JOINING THE PARTY WITH HER HANDS FULL OF PAPER DOLLS ALL SUFFERING FOR BALL-DRESSES
I DOUBT THAT MYSELF THOUGH ANSWERED TOM NEARLY KNOCKING THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL OUT WITH HIS ENERGETIC DEMONSTRATIONS FOR IT REALLY WAS A RELIEF TO DO SOMETHING
S WAS A DOMESTIC MAN AND ADMIRED HOUSEWIFELY ACCOMPLISHMENTS
THERE WAS SO MUCH LOVE IN HER OWN HOME THAT SHE QUICKLY FELT THE WANT OF IT IN FANNY'S AND PUZZLED HERSELF TO FIND OUT WHY THESE PEOPLE WERE NOT KIND AND PATIENT TO ONE ANOTHER
I VE GOT SOME NOTES AND THINGS I WANT TO ASK YOUR OPINION ABOUT IF THEY REALLY MEAN ANYTHING YOU KNOW SAID FANNY GETTING OUT A BUNDLE OF PAPERS FROM THE INMOST RECESSES OF HER DESK
FOR HERE AS IN THE BIG WORLD OUTSIDE GENIUS SEEMED TO BLOSSOM BEST WHEN POVERTY WAS HEAD GARDENER
SOME ONE BROUGHT A LAMP AND WE PEEPED ANXIOUSLY DOWN TO SEE OUR OWN STUPID BIDDY SITTING IN THE TUB WRINGING HER HANDS AND WAILING DISMALLY
ONE AFTERNOON JUST BEFORE DINNER SHE FELT SO TIRED OF DOING NOTHING THAT SHE SLIPPED OUT FOR A RUN
POLLY WAS SO EXCITED BY THIS SUDDEN PLUNGE INTO THE DISSIPATIONS OF CITY LIFE THAT SHE FLEW ABOUT LIKE A DISTRACTED BUTTERFLY AND HARDLY KNEW WHAT HAPPENED TILL SHE FOUND HERSELF SEATED BEFORE THE GREAT GREEN CURTAIN IN THE BRILLIANT THEATRE
SHE GETS ROUND IT VERY NEATLY IN HER NOTE I WON'T BE A BURDEN WILL SACRIFICE HER HOPES AND ALWAYS REMAIN MY WARM FRIEND BUT THE TRUTH IS TOM SHAW RICH WAS WORTH MAKING MUCH OF BUT TOM SHAW POOR IS IN THE WAY AND MAY GO TO THE DEVIL AS FAST AS HE LIKES WELL HE IS N'T GOING CRIED POLLY DEFIANTLY FOR HER WRATH BURNED HOTLY AGAINST TRIX THOUGH SHE BLESSED HER FOR SETTING THE BONDMAN FREE
NO ONE DREAMED WHAT WAS GOING AN UNDER THE MUSLIN FROCK TILL GRANDMA'S WISE OLD EYES SPIED OUT THE LITTLE SHADOW ON POLLY'S SPIRITS AND GUESSED THE CAUSE OF IT
I LL WRITE AND ASK STRAIGHT AWAY IF YOU WANT ME TO SUPPOSE YOU DO
BUT I KNOW YOUR WAY OF HELPING PROUD PEOPLE
JUST ENOUGH NECESSITY TO KEEP YOU BUSY TILL YOU FIND HOW GOOD WORK IS
AND JUST AT THAT AWKWARD MINUTE DOWN TUMBLED HIS FATHER'S OLD BEAVER OVER HIS HEAD AND FACE PUTTING A COMICAL QUENCHER ON HIS SELF-REPROACHES
DO FOR MERCY SAKE STOP TALKING ABOUT POLLY I M SICK TO DEATH OF IT CRIED FANNY SNAPPISHLY
I DID LIKE MARIA FOR SHE REMINDED ME OF YOU SOMETIMES AND WAS SUCH A KIND COSY LITTLE WOMAN I COULD N'T HELP ENJOYING HER SOCIETY AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK
I LL JUST WHISK OFF MY REGIMENTALS AND POLLY THE MAID BECOMES POLLY THE MISSIS
IT S BRIGHT NOW AND THE AIR WILL DO YOU GOOD
SHE NEED N'T THINK I BELIEVE IT
I CAN'T TRUST YOU NOT TO HINT OR SAY TOO MUCH YOU SHALL
THE UPPER SKIRT WILL BE MADE SCANTER AND FINISHED WITH A FRILL
OH INDEED
BUT I LL SHOW HER THAT SHE NEED N'T AND DO ALL I CAN TO HELP HER
SHE DREADS POVERTY EVEN MORE THAN I DO BUT SHE BEGGED HIM TO TAKE IT IF IT WOULD HELP HIM
ACTUALLY I HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR BEGAN FAN IMPRESSIVELY
IT WAS DUSK WHEN THEY WENT OUT AND POLLY WAS MUCH RELIEVED TO FIND THE CARRIAGE WAITING FOR THEM BECAUSE PLAYING THIRD FIDDLE WAS NOT TO HER TASTE AND SHE HAD HAD ENOUGH OF IT FOR ONE DAY
TRY IT AGAIN ANSWERED TOM WATCHING HER AS SHE WENT LAUGHING AWAY LOOKING ALL THE PRETTIER FOR HER DISHEVELMENT
THEY ALL WANT TO HEAR YOU AND BEGGED I D ASK THEN I WILL WITH PLEASURE
MISS MILLS SUGGESTED IT AND JENNY IS SO GLAD TO DO ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY IT S A PLEASURE TO LET HER I VE HEARD OF MISS MILLS BEFORE
BUT NEXT TO THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO BE AN OLD MAID LIKE MISS MILLS POLLY'S SOBER FACE AND EMPHATIC TONE MADE FANNY LAUGH AND AT THE CHEERY SOUND A YOUNG GIRL PUSHING A BABY-CARRIAGE LOOKED ROUND AND SMILED
THAT WAS THE REASON POLLY PREACHED AND I KEPT TALKING WHEN SHE WAS GONE VERY STUPID OF ME
BY THE TIME THE BUMP ON MY FOREHEAD HAD SWELLED AS BIG AS A NUT OUR APRONS WERE HALF FULL AND WE SAT DOWN TO ENJOY OURSELVES
BUT WHEN SHE LAY DOWN AT LAST HER PILLOW SEEMED VERY SOFT HER LITTLE ROOM VERY LOVELY WITH THE FIRELIGHT FLICKERING ON ALL THE HOME-LIKE OBJECTS AND HER NEW-BLOWN ROSES BREATHING HER A SWEET GOOD-NIGHT
SEE WHO IT IS PUG ANSWERED TOM AS A TINGLE BROKE THE SILENCE OF THE HOUSE
YOUR NOSE IS AS RED AS THAT CRANBERRY SAUCE ANSWERED FAN COMING OUT OF THE BIG CHAIR WHERE SHE HAD BEEN CURLED UP FOR AN HOUR OR TWO DEEP IN LADY AUDLEY'S SECRET SO IT IS SAID POLLY SHUTTING ONE EYE TO LOOK AT THE OFFENDING FEATURE
MAUD GIVE ME MY SHETLAND SHAWL AND PUT A CUSHION AT MY BACK AS MAUD OBEYED HER MOTHER WITH A REPROVING LOOK AT HER ERRING BROTHER AND SISTER A PAUSE FOLLOWED FOR WHICH EVERY ONE SEEMED GRATEFUL
TOM HAD N'T EVEN A WHISTLE AT HIS COMMAND
THEN STOPPED SHORT NOT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY FOR HERSELF
AND LAYING A SPECIALLY LARGE PIECE IN ONE OF GRANDMA'S QUAINT LITTLE CHINA PLATES POLLY ADDED THE FLOWERS AND HANDED IT TO TOM WITH A LOOK THAT SAID A GOOD DEAL FOR SEEING THAT HE REMEMBERED HER SERMON SHE WAS GLAD TO FIND THAT HER ALLEGORY HELD GOOD IN ONE SENSE AT LEAST
WILLY LIKES FLOSSY BEST SO STOP CRYING AND COME RIGHT ALONG YOU NAUGHTY CHILD AS POOR LITTLE DIDO WAS JERKED AWAY BY THE UNSYMPATHETIC MAID AND PURPLE-GAITERS ESSAYED IN VAIN TO PLEAD HIS CAUSE POLLY SAID TO HERSELF WITH A SMILE AND A SIGH
HIS HANDS CAME OUT OF HIS POCKETS HE STOPPED WHISTLING BUTTONED HIS JACKET GAVE HIS CAP A PULL AND WENT OFF AT A GREAT PACE
FIRST THE BIG DOG BARKING AT INTERVALS
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU IN MY LAST LETTER
PERHAPS THIS SMASH-UP WAS SENT TO INTRODUCE ME TO MY OWN FATHER THERE S PHILOSOPHY FOR YOU SAID POLLY SMILING EVEN WHILE SHE FELT AS IF ADVERSITY WAS GOING TO DO MORE FOR TOM THAN YEARS OF PROSPERITY
IT S SUCH FUN TO PLAY COOK FANNY WAS NOT SO ENTHUSIASTIC AS HER SISTER FOR HER EYES SAW MANY TRACES OF WHAT SEEMED LIKE POVERTY TO HER
THEN WE SHOULD HAVE NO MORE TROUBLE OBSERVED MISS PERKINS WHO HAD JUST MADE THE GRAND TOUR AND HAD BROUGHT HOME A FRENCH MAID
MAY I COPY THAT LETTER SOME TIME GRANDMA YES DEAR AND WELCOME
AUSTER'S COMING SHOUTED TOM AS CAME RATTLING DOWN THE LONG STEEP STREET OUTSIDE THE PARK
BUT YOU LL KNOW WHAT TO DO
BESIDES I DID N'T KNOW AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND ME AS A TEACHER THOUGH YOU LIKE ME WELL ENOUGH AS PLAIN POLLY MY DEAR OF COURSE I WOULD AND WE WANT YOU TO TAKE MAUD AT ONCE AND TEACH HER YOUR SWEET SONGS
HE WILL BE VERY ANGRY I DARE SAY
COME AND GET A NICE DISH TO PUT IT IN SAID FAN WHEN POLLY PROPOSED TO GO HALVES WITH TOM LEST HE SHOULD COME BURSTING IN SOMEHOW AND SEIZE THE WHOLE
POLLY ENJOYED THESE TIMES AND TOLD STORIES PLAYED GAMES OR WENT OUT WALKING JUST AS MAUD LIKED SLOWLY AND SURELY WINNING THE CHILD'S HEART AND RELIEVING THE WHOLE HOUSE OF THE YOUNG TYRANT WHO RULED IT
ANY NEWS OF ANYBODY WHISPERED FAN AFFECTING TO EXAMINE A SLEEVE WITH CARE
BUT TOM WAS NOW UNDER WATER STABBING HIS ALLIGATOR AND TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE INDIGNANT DEPARTURE OF THE YOUNG LADIES
FATHER HAS N'T TOUCHED MOTHER'S MONEY
SHE ONLY MEANT TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND THERE WAS NO HARM IN THAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY SHE YIELDED TO THE VARIOUS SMALL TEMPTATIONS THAT BESET PRETTY YOUNG GIRLS AND DID MORE MISCHIEF TO OTHERS THAN TO HERSELF
I LIKE THE OTHER BEST BECAUSE IT HAS A FEATHER
BUT THEY ARE SIMPLE SENSIBLE CREATURES FULL OF TALENT AND ALL SORTS OF FINE THINGS
BUT WHEN SHE GOT SHARP I FANCIED IT WAS DYSPEPSIA
WE USED TO GET TIRED OF TRYING
SHE BEGAN TO SEE NOW WHAT TRUE LOVE WAS AND TO FEEL THAT THE SENTIMENT WHICH SHE COULD NOT CONQUER WAS A TREASURE TO BE ACCEPTED WITH REVERENCE AND CHERISHED WITH DEVOTION
HE GOT CAUGHT DIRECTLY
IF THE OTHER LETTER IS AS BAD I D BETTER HAVE A CHAIR BEFORE I READ IT SAID POLLY FEELING THAT SHE BEGAN TO TREMBLE WITH EXCITEMENT
AS FOR FAN I DON'T THINK WE CAN BE FRIENDS ANY MORE
I WAS JUST WISHING YOU WERE HERE TO ARRANGE MY FLOWERS
OH NEP IT S SO HARD TO PUT LOVE AWAY WHEN YOU WANT IT VERY MUCH AND IT IS N'T RIGHT TO TAKE IT A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DOG BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER-HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
AND WHEN SHE WENT ANYWHERE PEOPLE LOOKED YOU KNOW AND SHE LIKED IT
YOU KNOW I COULD MANAGE A POUND OF BACON AND A TANKARD OF GOOD ALE FOR MY BREAKFAST IN THE COUNTRY BUT IN LONDON I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH HALF THE QUANTITY THOUGH I MUST OWN I AM GENERALLY EAGER ENOUGH FOR THE DINNER HOUR WHICH IS HERE DELAYED TILL TWELVE IN YOUR POLITE SOCIETY
GO GET THEM MAUD AND WE LL REPAIR DAMAGES SAID TOM SHUTTING THE CULPRIT INTO THE BOOT CLOSET WHERE HE PLACIDLY ROLLED HIMSELF UP AND WENT TO SLEEP
THINGS GOT STEADY AGAIN DIRECTLY AND WHILE MAUD EXPATIATED ON THE GREAT SURPRISE POLLY VENTURED TO LOOK AT TOM FEELING GLAD THAT HER BACK WAS TOWARD THE LIGHT AND HIS WAS NOT
IF I WERE YOU I D HAVE A COUPLE OF NEAT PRETTY PRINTS FOR HOME-WEAR AND THEN I DON'T SEE WHY YOU ARE N'T FIXED WELL ENOUGH FOR OUR SHORT SEASON CAN'T I DO ANYTHING WITH THIS BAREGE
SHE D RATHER GO AND I DON'T WONDER
YES THAT IS CHARMING IS N'T IT POLLY AND FAN ROSE TO INSPECT THE SUCCESS OF MONSIEUR'S LONG LABOR
I LL HAVE THOSE PLUMS IF I BREAK MY NECK DOING IT AND HALF SLIDING HALF WALKING I WENT DOWN THE SLOPING ROOF TILL THE BOUGHS OF THE TREE WERE WITHIN MY REACH
COME HERE FAN AND MIND THIS ONE THING
AND IT SAVES EVER SO MUCH TROUBLE AIN'T YOU AFRAID OF THEM OF COURSE I M NOT
HE S UP IN MAMMA'S ROOM AND WAS JUST SAYING HOW S POLLY WHEN I HEARD YOU COME IN YOUR CREEP-MOUSE WAY AND YOU MUST GO RIGHT UP
THE GIRLS WENT TO BED TIRED OUT
GUESS HE WON'T HURT HIMSELF
YOU NEED N'T SAVE ANY OLD SILK GOWNS FOR ME
POLLY LIKED THE CHANGE IMMENSELY AND SAT LISTENING TO THE STATE OF WESTERN TRADE WITH AS MUCH INTEREST AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE MOST THRILLING ROMANCE FOR AS HE TALKED TOM KEPT LOOKING AT HER WITH A NOD OR A SMILE SO LIKE OLD TIMES THAT FOR A LITTLE WHILE SHE FORGOT MARIA BAILEY AND WAS IN BLISS
SO I GAVE MY CHECK TO A MAN AND THERE HE IS WITH MY TRUNK AND POLLY WALKED OFF AFTER HER ONE MODEST PIECE OF BAGGAGE FOLLOWED BY TOM WHO FELT A TRIFLE DEPRESSED BY HIS OWN REMISSNESS IN POLITE ATTENTIONS
FOR POLLY LIVED IN A QUIET COUNTRY TOWN AND KNEW VERY LITTLE OF CITY FASHIONS
TO-NIGHT FOR EXAMPLE
SHOULD N'T DARE TO BOTHER HIM IF HE DID WHY NOT HE D PULL MY EARS AND CALL ME A STUPID OR TELL ME NOT TO WORRY HIM I DON'T THINK HE WOULD
I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HIM
AND YOU ARE ANOTHER ANSWERED BELLE WHO HAD ALWAYS LOVED POLLY IN HER SCATTER-BRAINED WAY
I SHOULD N'T THINK YOU D ENVY ANYBODY FOR YOU VE GOT ONE ANOTHER SAID POLLY WITH SUCH A WISTFUL LOOK THAT IT SUDDENLY SET TOM AND FANNY TO WONDERING WHY THEY DID N'T HAVE BETTER TIMES TOGETHER AND ENJOY THEMSELVES AS POLLY AND JIM DID
AS THE FIRST PART OF AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL WAS WRITTEN IN 1869 THE DEMAND FOR A SEQUEL IN BESEECHING LITTLE LETTERS THAT MADE REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE RENDERED IT NECESSARY TO CARRY MY HEROINE BOLDLY FORWARD SOME SIX OR SEVEN YEARS INTO THE FUTURE
I PITIED HER AND HAD HER HERE A GOOD DEAL AND TOM TOOK HER PART
OH DON'T
SO I WASHED IT NICELY AND WE FUSSED AND PLANNED BUT IT CAME SHORT BY HALF OF ONE SLEEVE
AND TOM WON'T
I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID THAT S NOT FOR ME TO SAY BUT IF IT IS SO IT S ONLY A PASSING FANCY AND HE LL SOON GET OVER IT DO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT
AND WHEN HER FIRST PETULANCE WAS OVER RESOLVED TO GIVE UP COASTING AND EVERYTHING ELSE RATHER THAN HAVE ANY NONSENSE WITH TOM WHO THANKS TO HIS NEGLECTED EDUCATION WAS AS IGNORANT AS HERSELF OF THE CHARMS OF THIS NEW AMUSEMENT FOR SCHOOL-CHILDREN
BOTH WHIRLED ROUND AND THERE WAS MR SHAW STANDING IN THE DOORWAY APPLAUDING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
POLLY KEPT THIS UP FOR A WEEK AND BY CAREFULLY AVOIDING THE SHAWS HOUSE DURING CALLING HOURS SHE SAW NOTHING OF MR SYDNEY WHO OF COURSE DID N'T VISIT HER AT MISS MILLS MINNIE HAPPENED TO BE POORLY THAT WEEK AND TOOK NO LESSON SO UNCLE SYD WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS LAST HOPE AND LOOKED AS IF HIS ALLOWANCE OF SUNSHINE HAD BEEN SUDDENLY CUT OFF
SHE WILL BE FAMOUS SOME DAY I KNOW SHE IS SO MODEST AND YET SO INTENT ON HER WORK
THE YOUNG LADIES GABBLED OVER THE LESSON WROTE AN EXERCISE AND READ A LITTLE FRENCH HISTORY
WHY DON'T HE GIVE ME MY VELOCIPEDE
IT S SO PLEASANT TO BE LIKED AND SHE LOOKED UP WITH HER FACE QUITE BRIGHT AGAIN
ONLY THE PICTURES
WHAT'S THE MATTER DEARY I DON'T KNOW
SHE HAS N'T GOT ANY BWETELLES TO HER DWESS AND I HAVE SAID MAUD SETTLING HER RUFFLED BANDS OVER HER SHOULDERS WHICH LOOKED LIKE CHERRY-COLORED WINGS ON A STOUT LITTLE CHERUB
SO THE HONEST BROWN COOKIES CRUMBLED AWAY IN OBSCURITY WHILE POLLY TRIED TO SATISFY HER HEARTY APPETITE ON ONE ICE AND THREE MACAROONS
THE GIRLS AT MISS COTTON'S WERE NOT ALLOWED LIGHTS IN THEIR ROOMS AFTER NINE O'CLOCK NEVER WENT OUT ALONE AND WERE EXPECTED TO BEHAVE LIKE MODELS OF PROPRIETY FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT
POOR MR SHAW HAD BEEN SO BUSY GETTING RICH THAT HE HAD NOT FOUND TIME TO TEACH HIS CHILDREN TO LOVE HIM
SPIDER SCRAPE UP THE SALAD AND POKE THE DISH THROUGH THE SLIDE FOR MORE
AND MANY LOVING EYES FOLLOWED THE LITTLE FIGURE IN THE DRAB FROCK AS IT WENT QUIETLY ABOUT DOING FOR THE LAST TIME THE SMALL SERVICES WHICH WOULD HELP TO MAKE ITS ABSENCE KEENLY FELT
THERE SHE IS AS YOU SAY BIGGER LOVELIER AND MORE IMPOSING THAN ANY WE SEE NOWADAYS
ONE AFTERNOON WHEN SHE HAD GONE OUT TO TEA AND OLD DEBBY THE MAID WAS ASLEEP IN HER ROOM WE SAT ON THE DOORSTEP FEELING HOMESICK AND READY FOR ANY THING TO AMUSE US
WOULD N'T POLLY MAKE A LOVELY BRIDE SAID MAUD WHO WAS REVOLVING ABOUT THE TWO GIRLS TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER SHE WOULD HAVE A BLUE OR A WHITE CLOAK WHEN SHE GREW UP AND WENT TO OPERAS
THIS NEW TREATMENT HAD AN EXCELLENT EFFECT
BUT I LL TRY AGAIN IF YOU WANT ME TO SAID POLLY WITH A PATIENT SIGH FOR HER ARMS WERE TIRED AND HER FACE UNCOMFORTABLY HOT
MOST OF US FIND MONEY ENOUGH FOR OUR LITTLE VANITIES AND PLEASURES BUT FEEL DREADFULLY POOR WHEN WE COME TO PAY FOR WORK SEWING ESPECIALLY
FANNY NEVER FAILED TO ASK HER TO EVERY SORT OF FESTIVITY IN THE SHAW MANSION
IF HE WAS THE ONLY MAN IN THE WORLD I WOULD N'T MARRY HIM BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO THE LAST THREE WORDS WERE ADDED IN A DIFFERENT TONE FOR POLLY HAD CHECKED HERSELF THERE WITH A HALF-FRIGHTENED LOOK AND TURNED AWAY TO HIDE HER FACE BEHIND HER HAIR AGAIN
POLLY HEARD IT AND INSTANTLY RESOLVED TO BE AS RAVING AND AS TEARING AS HER MEANS WOULD ALLOW JUST FOR ONE NIGHT SHE SAID AS SHE PEEPED OVER THE BANISTERS GLAD TO SEE THAT THE DANCE AND THE RACE HAD TAKEN THE BAND-BOXY AIR OUT OF TOM'S ELEGANT ARRAY
WILL IS N'T ALL THAT JIMMY WAS TO ME
AND BEFORE A WEEK WAS GONE SHE WAS AS HEARTILY SICK OF ALL THIS AS A HEALTHY PERSON WOULD BE WHO ATTEMPTED TO LIVE ON CONFECTIONERY
BUT SHE ALWAYS FOUND SHE COULD AND SO CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS A MERCIFUL PROVISION OF NATURE THAT GIRLS HEARTS COULD STAND SO MUCH AND THEIR APPETITES CONTINUE GOOD WHEN UNREQUITED LOVE WAS STARVING
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING NOW SIR DEMANDED MR SHAW AS TOM EMERGED RED AND SOLEMN FROM HIS BRIEF OBSCURITY
YOU LL NEVER GUESS MAUD SO I WOULD N'T TRY BUT BE PLANNING WHAT YOU WILL PUT IN YOUR CUNNING THREE-CORNERED CLOSET WHEN YOU GET IT HAVING GOT RID OF MISS PAULINA PRY AS TOM CALLED MAUD WHO WAS IMMEDIATELY ABSORBED BY HER CUPBOARD THE OLDER GIRLS SOBERLY DISCUSSED THE SUDDEN CHANGE WHICH HAD COME AND POLLY WAS SURPRISED TO SEE WHAT UNEXPECTED STRENGTH AND SENSE FANNY SHOWED
YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN
WELL PLEASED AT THE SUCCESS OF HIS MISSION SYDNEY ARTFULLY LED THE CONVERSATION TO MUSIC AND FOR A TIME POLLY FORGOT HER WOES TALKING ENTHUSIASTICALLY ON HER FAVORITE THEME
DON'T YOU EVER FORGET TO LIFT YOUR SASH AND FIX THOSE PUFFY THINGS WHEN YOU SIT DOWN BEFORE FANNY COULD ANSWER A SCREAM FROM BELOW MADE BOTH LISTEN
HE S COMING
HE S COMING
I M DEAD SICK OF PARTIES AND FLIRTATIONS TRYING TO OUT-DRESS MY NEIGHBORS AND GOING THE SAME ROUND YEAR AFTER YEAR LIKE A SQUIRREL IN A CAGE FANNY'S TONE WAS BITTER AS WELL AS DISCONTENTED HER FACE SAD AS WELL AS LISTLESS AND POLLY HAD AN INSTINCTIVE FEELING THAT SOME TROUBLE MORE REAL THAN ANY SHE HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE WAS LYING HEAVY AT HER FRIEND'S HEART
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO TOM WHEN MAUD SAT WATCHING HIM WITH HER FACE FULL OF WISTFULNESS THAT SHE WANTED TO BE PETTED AS MUCH AS EVER HE DID IN HIS NEGLECTED BOYHOOD OR THAT WHEN HE CALLED HER PUG BEFORE PEOPLE HER LITTLE FEELINGS WERE AS DEEPLY WOUNDED AS HIS USED TO BE WHEN THE BOYS CALLED HIM CARROTS HE WAS FOND OF HER IN HIS FASHION BUT HE DID N'T TAKE THE TROUBLE TO SHOW IT SO MAUD WORSHIPPED HIM AFAR OFF AFRAID TO BETRAY THE AFFECTION THAT NO REBUFF COULD KILL OR COOL
I VE BOOKED YOU NEVERTHELESS SO IN YOU GO
FOR THE SAUCEPAN FELL OFF THE SHED AND FAN'S FEET ARE ALL BOILED PURPLE NOBODY LAUGHED AT THIS FUNNY MESSAGE AND AUNT BETSEY RAN ALL THE WAY HOME WITH A MUFFIN IN HER HAND AND HER BALL IN HER POCKET THOUGH THE KNITTING WAS LEFT BEHIND
BUT HER PURPOSE GAVE HER COURAGE AND WHEN THE ICE WAS ONCE BROKEN HER LITTLE PUPILS QUICKLY LEARNED TO LOVE HER
AND AT THE SAME TIME SHE IS A TRUE WOMAN
I USED TO THINK HER A VERY FINE GIRL
POKE THE GIRLS IN CORNERS GIVE EM JUST ONE TASTE OF SOMETHING AND THEN GO AND STUFF LIKE PIGS WHISPERED TOM WITH A SUPERIOR AIR FORGETTING CERTAIN PRIVATE BANQUETS OF HIS OWN AFTER COMPANY HAD DEPARTED
IT WILL DO US GOOD
AND HAVING CHOSEN HER YOU MUST ABIDE YOUR CHOICE FOR BETTER OR WORSE IT HAS N'T COME TO THAT YET MUTTERED TOM AS HE LAY DOWN AGAIN WITH A REBELLIOUS AIR
IT WAS A PAPER BAG OF PEANUTS AND POKED DOWN AT THE VERY BOTTOM A PHOTOGRAPH OF TOM
ONE FAIR CREATURE ASSERTED THAT JOE SOMEBODY TOOK SO MUCH CHAMPAGNE AT THE LAST GERMAN THAT HE HAD TO BE GOT AWAY AND SENT HOME WITH TWO SERVANTS
ONLY POLLY
MAUD THE TRAITOR SAT DEMURELY AT WORK LOOKING VERY LIKE WHAT TOM HAD CALLED HER A MAGPIE WITH MISCHIEF IN ITS HEAD
IS YOUR LESSON TOO HARD FOR YOU SHE ASKED ONE EVENING AS A GROAN MADE HER LOOK ACROSS THE TABLE TO WHERE TOM SAT SCOWLING OVER A PILE OF DILAPIDATED BOOKS WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS HAIR AS IF HIS HEAD WAS IN DANGER OF FLYING ASUNDER WITH THE TREMENDOUS EFFORT HE WAS MAKING
SO LIKE DEAR PARIS AND SHE HAS LIVED ABROAD
WHAT AN IDEA WELL THAT S THE PLAIN ENGLISH OF HALF YOUR FASHIONABLE MATCHES
POLLY FELT THIS
FOR IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MISS COTTON FELT A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS AT OUR SUDDEN WEARINESS
BUT POLLY A PRINCIPLE THAT CAN'T BEAR BEING LAUGHED AT FROWNED ON AND COLD-SHOULDERED IS N'T WORTHY OF THE NAME I WANT TO BE STRONG-MINDED IN THE REAL SENSE OF THE WORD BUT I DON'T LIKE TO BE CALLED SO BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND MY MEANING
THAT HOUSE WAS GIVEN HER BUT INSTEAD OF LIVING IN IT ALL ALONE SHE FILLED IT WITH POOR GENTLEFOLKS WHO NEEDED NEAT RESPECTABLE HOMES BUT COULD N'T GET ANYTHING COMFORTABLE FOR THEIR LITTLE MONEY
THE DRESS FAN HAD TAKEN OFF LAY ON A CHAIR AND INTO IT GOT TOM CHUCKLING WITH SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER FOR POLLY WAS ABSORBED AND THE BED-CURTAINS HID HIS INIQUITY
GRANDMA KNOWS ALL SORTS OF NICE CONTRIVANCES
ON MONDAY POLLY BEGAN THE DELICATE AND DANGEROUS TASK INSTEAD OF GOING TO HER PUPILS BY WAY OF THE PARK AND THE PLEASANT STREETS ADJOINING SHE TOOK A ROUNDABOUT ROUTE THROUGH BACK STREETS AND THUS ESCAPED MR SYDNEY WHO AS USUAL CAME HOME TO DINNER VERY EARLY THAT DAY AND LOOKED DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE HE NOWHERE SAW THE BRIGHT FACE IN THE MODEST BONNET
HURRAH FOR MADAM HANCOCK AND THE PRETTY GIRLS
KNOWING NOTHING OF BUSINESS HE WAS NOT OF MUCH USE TO HIS FATHER THOUGH HE TRIED TO BE AND GENERALLY ENDED BY FEELING THAT HE WAS A HINDRANCE NOT A HELP
DO WAY TARLEY I DON'T LITE YOU CRIED LITTLE BLUE-BONNET CASTING DOWN HER ERMINE MUFF AND SOBBING IN A MICROSCOPIC HANDKERCHIEF THE THREAD-LACE EDGING ON WHICH COULD N'T MITIGATE HER WOE AS IT MIGHT HAVE DONE THAT OF AN OLDER SUFFERER
HE S GOT TO LEARN THAT I M NOT TO BE SHAKEN BY A LITTLE CHIT LIKE HIM
KEEP TIME TO THE MUSIC GASPED POLLY
DO YOU SEW ASKED JENNY
HER ONLY COMFORT WAS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE MODEST TUCKER DRAWN UP ROUND THE PLUMP SHOULDERS WAS REAL LACE AND THAT HER BRONZE BOOTS COST NINE DOLLARS
BUT FANNY HAD HEARD IT BEFORE AND HAVING A TEMPER OF HER OWN SAID PERTLY I M SURE I HAVE N'T DONE ANYTHING SO VERY DREADFUL
IT WILL BE ALL PLAIN SAILING FOR SYD I FANCY OBSERVED TOM GETTING UP AS IF THE LITTLE CRICKET SUDDENLY CEASED TO BE COMFORTABLE
POLLY S A VERWY QUEER GIRL AND GWANDMA PETS HER A GWEAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE DOES ME OBSERVED MAUD WITH AN INJURED AIR
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THE GOVERNOR WILL SAY TO YOU GIRLS GOING ON SO WITH THOSE DANDIES
AND BEING ORDERED TO KEEP QUIET HE SAID THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH POLLY AND WATCHED HER WITH A GRATEFUL FACE AS SHE CREPT AWAY
I DID N'T MEAN TO MUTTERED TOM AS HE HASTILY DEPARTED LEAVING POLLY TO GROAN OVER HER SPRAINED WRIST
I DON'T MEAN TO BE A FINE LADY WHEN I GROW UP I M GOING TO BE A FARMER'S WIFE AND MAKE BUTTER AND CHEESE AND HAVE TEN CHILDREN AND RAISE PIGS SHE ADDED IN ONE ENTHUSIASTIC BURST
LET S CHANGE THE SUBJECT SAID POLLY LOOKING RELIEVED HERSELF
I DON'T WANT A RELIGION THAT I PUT AWAY WITH MY SUNDAY CLOTHES AND DON'T TAKE OUT TILL THE DAY COMES ROUND AGAIN
SHERRY CUT INTO THE KITCHEN AND BRING A CUP OF COFFEE
HERE S RICHNESS SAID POLLY TO HERSELF AS SHE ROLLED AWAY FEELING AS CINDERELLA PROBABLY DID WHEN THE PUMPKIN-COACH BORE HER TO THE FIRST BALL ONLY POLLY HAD TWO PRINCES TO THINK ABOUT AND POOR CINDERELLA ON THAT OCCASION HAD NOT EVEN ONE
THANK YOU DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF WITH MY PARCELS NO TROUBLE I ASSURE YOU AND THIS BOOK REMINDS ME OF WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
OH PLEASE SIR DON'T BLAME FAN MUCH FOR SHE TRULY IS N'T HALF AS SILLY AS TRIX AND THE OTHER GIRLS
SHE NEVER SAID MUCH OF HERSELF IN HER LETTERS AND FANNY'S FIRST EXCLAMATION WHEN THEY MET AGAIN WAS AN ANXIOUS WHY POLLY DEAR
FOR ONLY THREE WEEKS AGO I SAW A GIRL YOUNGER THAN ANY OF US AND NO WORSE WHO TRIED TO DESTROY HERSELF SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE WAS SO DISCOURAGED SICK AND POOR SAID POLLY
FOR WHAT THE TIRED LOOK IN HER EYES I DON'T SEE IT SAID TOM AFTER A SURVEY THROUGH THE GLASS
THE LARGEST WAS A REGULAR HOTHOUSE BOUQUET OF TEA-ROSEBUDS SCENTLESS HEATH AND SMILAX
DID YOU HEAR WHAT WE WERE SAYING DEMANDED FANNY UNEASILY
THAT WON'T SUIT HER
WITH MOST GIRLS HE WAS VERY LIKE THE OTHER YOUNG MEN OF HIS SET EXCEPT PERHAPS IN A CERTAIN GRACE OF MANNER WHICH WAS AS NATURAL TO HIM AS HIS RESPECT FOR ALL WOMANKIND
IT BLINDETH THE EYES TO FAULTS
NOW I VE LOOKED INTO THE MATTER AND I DECLARE TO YOU POLLY I M FRIGHTENED TO SEE HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO DRESS ME NOT SO MUCH AS SOME GIRLS I KNOW SAID POLLY ENCOURAGINGLY
CHAIRS WERE FEW AND POLLY HAD TAKEN HALF OF WILL'S WHEN THEY DREW ROUND THE FIRE
HI THEY VE GOT HIM WAS THE ONLY ANSWER VOUCHSAFED BY THE ABSORBED READER
HOW CAN I WHEN I AIN'T A BIT LIKE HIM CRIED TOM AMAZED
WHILE LITTLE NICK WOULD SING TILL HE VIBRATED ON HIS PERCH WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY RESPONSE EXCEPT AN INQUISITIVE CHIRP FROM THE PERT SPARROWS WHO SEEMED TO TWIT HIM WITH HIS CAPTIVITY
I CAN GET IT FOR HER BY RUNNING ROUND TO MY FRIENDS BUT I REALLY HAVE N'T THE TIME TILL I GET THE MULLERS OFF
WAIT FOR YOUR TURN TOMMY
FROM MR FRANK I GUESS
THANK YOU I LL TAKE AN UNBLEACHED COTTON SHIRT IF YOU HAVE SUCH A THING FOR IT IS LIKELY TO BE NEEDED BEFORE A CAMBRIC FROCK REPLIED POLLY SUBSIDING INTO HER CORNER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE FOR AT LEAST SIX EYE-GLASSES WERE UP AND SHE DID N'T ENJOY BEING STARED AT
IT WON'T HURT TOM BUT I HATE TO HAVE HIM MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF OUT OF PITY FOR HE IS MORE OF A MAN THAN HE SEEMS AND I DON'T WANT ANY ONE TO PLAGUE HIM NO ONE BUT YOURSELF SAID POLLY SMILING
TORTURES WOULD N'T HAVE DRAWN A WORD OF ALL THIS FROM HIM BUT IT HAD ITS EFFECT FOR BOYS DON'T LEAVE THEIR HEARTS AND CONSCIENCES BEHIND THEM WHEN THEY ENTER COLLEGE AND LITTLE THINGS OF THIS SORT DO MUCH TO KEEP BOTH FROM BEING DAMAGED BY THE FOUR YEARS SCRIMMAGE WHICH BEGINS THE BATTLE OF LIFE FOR MOST OF THEM
THAT HELPS ONE AMAZINGLY
OH POLLY I AM SO GLAD
THAT TOUCHED HER SO MUCH
NO I M A MUSIC TEACHER AND TROT ROUND GIVING LESSONS ALL DAY HOW BEAUTIFUL IT SOUNDS AND HOW HAPPY YOU MUST BE SO STRONG AND PRETTY AND ABLE TO GO ROUND MAKING MUSIC ALL THE TIME SIGHED JENNY LOOKING WITH RESPECTFUL ADMIRATION AT THE PLUMP FIRM HAND HELD IN BOTH HER THIN AND FEEBLE ONES
I D LIKE TO HAVE SEEN YOU FLOURISHING ROUND THERE WITH YOUR HATCHET ADDED TOM ADMIRINGLY AND THE OLD LADY LOOKED AS MUCH PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A GIRL
BY GEORGE THAT S A JOLLY TUNE
BUT THIS IS THE THING I SUPPOSE AND NOT A WORD MUST BE SAID OF COURSE IT IS
WHAT ARE YOU BLUSHING SO FOR ASKED FANNY AS THE PAINTED SYLPHS VANISHED
SHE WANTS WORK AND THESE YOUNG LADIES PROBABLY HAVE QUANTITIES DONE SOMEWHERE
HE ONLY LAUGHED IN HER FACE STUCK HIS RED HAIR STRAIGHT UP ALL OVER HIS HEAD AND GLARED AT HER TILL SHE FLED IN DISMAY
SYDNEY BEING A MODEST MAN THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE KIND BUT SIMPLY FANCIED THAT LITTLE POLLY WAS GROWING UP TO BE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN
DO SPEAK YOUR PIECE TO ME I DO SO LIKE MACAULAY'S LAYS IT S DREADFUL LONG BEGAN TOM
MY HEAD ACHES SO I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I M DOING THIS MORNING FANNY SPOKE FAST AND LAUGHED UNCOMFORTABLY AS SHE WENT BACK TO THE SOFA WONDERING IF POLLY HAD TOLD HER A LIE
THE CHILDREN HAD LITTLE TIP THE TERRIER TO SLEEP IN THEIR ROOM
ANY ONE MIGHT HAVE LECTURED HIM FOR AN HOUR WITHOUT DOING AS MUCH GOOD AS THAT LITTLE CALL AND THE CHAT THAT GREW OUT OF IT FOR THOUGH NOTHING VERY WISE OR WITTY WAS SAID MANY THINGS WERE SUGGESTED AND EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT PERSUASIVE INFLUENCES ARE BETTER THAN ANY AMOUNT OF MORALIZING
AND WHEN A MINUTE AFTER SHE PASSED A GRAY OLD COUPLE WALKING PLACIDLY TOGETHER IN THE SUNSHINE SHE FELT BETTER STILL AND WAS GLAD TO SEE SUCH A HAPPY ENDING TO THE ROMANCE SHE HAD READ ALL DOWN THE STREET
IN WAYS SO DELICATE THAT THE MOST SENSITIVE PRIDE COULD NOT RESENT THE FAVOR THESE TRUE GENTLEFOLK SHOWED POLLY THEIR RESPECT AND REGARD PUT MANY PLEASURES IN HER WAY AND WHEN THEY PAID HER FOR HER WORK GAVE HER ALSO THE HEARTY THANKS THAT TAKES AWAY ALL SENSE OF DEGRADATION EVEN FROM THE HUMBLEST SERVICE FOR MONEY SO EARNED AND PAID SWEETENS THE DAILY BREAD IT BUYS AND MAKES THE MUTUAL OBLIGATION A MUTUAL BENEFIT AND PLEASURE
AND HER FAVORITES WERE SCOTCH AIRS SUCH AS YELLOW-HAIRED LADDIE JOCK O HAZELDEAN DOWN AMONG THE HEATHER AND BIRKS OF ABERFELDIE THE MORE SHE SUNG THE BETTER SHE DID IT
THE MUSCLES HERE ARE N'T RIGHT AND YOU VE GOT JUST WHAT I WANT SAID BECKY SLAPPING THE ROUND ARM OF THE STATUE AT WHICH FAN WAS GAZING WITH AWE
WHAT CRIED TOM LOOKING AS IF HE THOUGHT SHE HAD LOST HER MIND
AND I KNOW YOU LL BE ALL HE HOPES TO FIND YOU FOR HE S JUST THE HUSBAND YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THANK YOU ALL THE MORE THEN FOR NOT KEEPING HIM YOURSELF SAID FANNY LAUGHING THE OLD BLITHE LAUGH AGAIN
YOU NEED N'T SNIFF AT HIM FOR HE IS NICE AND TREATS ME WITH RESPECT CRIED MAUD WITH AN ENERGY THAT MADE TOM LAUGH IN HER FACE
I LL WEAR IT FOR WILL HE LIKES IT AND CLOTHES CAN'T CHANGE HIS LOVE FOR ME I AM AFRAID THE WHOLESOME SWEETNESS OF POLLY'S NATURE WAS GETTING A LITTLE SOURED BY THESE TROUBLES
FAN AND TOM ARE BOTH MISTAKEN AND I LL SHOW THEM THAT POLLY IS AWAKE SHE THOUGHT INDIGNANTLY
I NEVER CAN RIGHT MYSELF HERE WITH ALL THE FELLOWS WATCHING AND LAYING WAGERS WHETHER I SINK OR SWIM
SHOULD N'T WONDER IF HE WAS HE S SUCH AN UNLUCKY DOG ANSWERED TOM RATHER SOBERLY
SHE S GOING TO KEEP HOUSE FOR WILL WHEN HE S A MINISTER I HEARD HER SAY SO CRIED MAUD WITH IMPORTANCE
BUT AS EVERYONE ELSE WAS FLYING ABOUT ALSO SHE BORE IT AS LONG AS SHE COULD KNOWING THAT TOM HAD MADE A MARTYR OF HIMSELF AND FEELING GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR THE SACRIFICE
BUT A GOOD DEAL OF IT MADE ME WANT TO GO UNDER THE SEAT
I VE TRIED TO THINK IT S NOTHING BUT VANITY OR IMAGINATION YET I CAN'T HELP SEEING A DIFFERENCE AND FEELING AS IF I OUGHT NOT TO PRETEND THAT I DON'T
I VE TOLD HER POLLY SAID FAN AS THEY SAT DOWN TOGETHER AND MAUD PERCHED HERSELF ON THE BED SO THAT SHE MIGHT RETIRE AMONG THE PILLOWS IF HER FEELINGS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HER
MARY WAS VERY LOW BUT ABOUT MIDNIGHT FELL ASLEEP AND I WAS TRYING TO KEEP THINGS QUIET WHEN MRS FINN SHE S THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE CAME AND BECKONED ME OUT WITH A SCARED FACE
SO HE SAT SHAKING UP THE CAMPHOR BOTTLE AND TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING PROPER AND COMFORTABLE TO SAY WHEN FANNY CAME TO THE RESCUE AND CUDDLED POLLY IN HER ARMS WITH SOOTHING LITTLE PATS AND WHISPERS AND KISSES TILL THE TEARS STOPPED AND POLLY SAID SHE DID N'T MEAN TO AND WOULD N'T ANY MORE
HAVE YOU GIVEN UP TEACHING THE ROTHS ASKED SYDNEY CHANGING THE SUBJECT
I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH AND SO DOES POLLY HAPPY FRESH SAID TOM WITH A COMICAL GROAN
BUT THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS DONE WILL DO HER MORE GOOD THAN DOUBLE THE MONEY BECAUSE IT WILL PROVE TO HER THAT SHE IS N'T WITHOUT FRIENDS AND MAKE HER FEEL THAT THERE IS A PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR HER
I D HAVE A LITTLE SWEETHEART DEAR IT S SO CUNNING ANSWERED MRS SHAW
SHE S FOND OF GAY COLORS AND GENERALLY LOOKS LIKE A WALKING RAINBOW CAN'T YOU GIVE HER A HINT
POLLY WAS INSTANTLY WHISKED UP STAIRS
AND WHEN FAN HAD TAKEN A MUSIC LESSON IN ANOTHER ROOM WHILE POLLY LOOKED ON IT WAS TIME FOR RECESS
DON'T YOU THINK SO ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
COME DOWN AND HAVE DINNER
POLLY DID NOT KNOW THIS AND WAS FORTUNATE IN POSSESSING A FRIEND WHO KNEW WHAT INFLUENCES WOULD SERVE HER BEST AND WHO COULD GIVE HER WHAT ALL WOMEN SHOULD DESIRE TO GIVE EACH OTHER THE EXAMPLE OF A SWEET GOOD LIFE MORE ELOQUENT AND POWERFUL THAN ANY WORDS
HE WENT AT THE LESSON WITH A WILL AND SOON FLOUNDERED OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES FOR POLLY GAVE HIM A LIFT HERE AND THERE AND THEY WENT ON SWIMMINGLY TILL THEY CAME TO SOME RULES TO BE LEARNED
YOU ASK IF I EVER THINK OF HOME
I DON'T MEAN THAT HE S WEAK OR BAD
IN VAIN SHE PROTESTED THAT SHE DID N'T WANT TO BE LIKE THE OTHER GIRLS IN THAT RESPECT
MRS SHAW WILL TAKE IT THE HARDEST BUT IT MAY STIR HER UP SO SHE WILL FORGET HER NERVES AND BE AS BUSY AND HAPPY AS MOTHER IS SAID POLLY TO HERSELF IN A HOPEFUL MOOD FOR POVERTY WAS AN OLD FRIEND AND SHE HAD LEARNED LONG AGO NOT TO FEAR IT BUT TO TAKE ITS BITTER AND ITS SWEET AND MAKE THE BEST OF BOTH
AT FIRST THE SMOKE DIRT AND NOISE WERE VERY DISAGREEABLE BUT I SOON GOT USED TO THESE THINGS AND NOW FIND ALL I SEE PERFECTLY CHARMING
BLESS MY HEART IT SEEMS AS IF I HEARD EM NOW
HE DID NOT STAY LONG BUT WE WERE VERY MERRY DRINKING HIS HEALTH RECEIVING HIS COMPLIMENTS AND ENJOYING THE HONOR HE DID US
I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN HIM FOR NEITHER IN APPEARANCE NOR CONVERSATION WAS HE AT ALL PRINCELY
SHE FORGOT ONE THING HOWEVER
GET THEM FOR MY PARTY
IT S DONE NOW THANKS TO YOUR NIMBLE FINGERS POLLY THREW THE WARM GARMENT OVER HER ARM FEELING A THRILL OF GRATITUDE THAT IT WAS TO WRAP A LIVING GIRL IN AND NOT TO HIDE AWAY A YOUNG HEART THAT HAD GROWN COLD TOO SOON
PEOPLE SAY SHE WAS FOND OF BELLE'S BROTHER
A SHOUT MADE US PAUSE AND LOOKING BACK THERE WAS THE POOR LITTLE CHAIR ROCKING ALL BY ITSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WHILE A SMALL BOY SAT ON THE FENCE AND WHOOPED
GRACIOUS ME TOM DON'T COME NOW
THE IDEA IS WORKING ITSELF CLEAR AND I FOLLOW AS FAST AS MY HANDS CAN
I VE COME FOR MAUD HE ANNOUNCED IN A PATERNAL TONE WHICH MADE THAT YOUNG LADY OPEN HER EYES
CHAPTER XIV
RICHARD WAS HIMSELF AGAIN WHEN POLLY ENTERED FOR THE HANDKERCHIEF HAD DISAPPEARED HIS HEAD WAS ERECT HIS FACE WAS STEADY AND HIS WHOLE AIR HAD A DOGGED COMPOSURE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY TO FATE HIT AWAY I M READY HE DID NOT HEAR POLLY COME IN FOR HE WAS LOOKING FIXEDLY AT THE FIRE WITH EYES THAT EVIDENTLY SAW A VERY DIFFERENT FUTURE THERE FROM THAT WHICH IT USED TO SHOW HIM
WHAT PLEASURE YOU BOYS CAN FIND IN SUCH UNGENTLEMANLY THINGS I DON'T SEE SAID FANNY WHO WAS EVIDENTLY OUT OF SORTS
SO WE PLANED A REVEL AFTER OUR OWN HEARTS AND SET OUR WITS TO WORK TO EXECUTE IT
I VE HAD A REGULARLY SPLENDID TIME AND THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH SHE SAID WHEN THE GOOD-NIGHTS WERE BEING EXCHANGED
I VE TOLD ALL I KNOW AND CAN'T MAKE UP ANY MORE ANSWERED POLLY LEANING HER HEAD ON HER HAND WITH A SORROWFUL LOOK THAT TOM HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
DO YOU WANT ANOTHER PILLOW SHE ADDED AS TOM GAVE HIS A THUMP
THE POOR GIRL KNEW AS MUCH OF HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS AS SNIP
DID I TELL YOU THAT WILL WAS GOING TO COLLEGE BROKE IN POLLY TO AVERT THE RISING STORM
BUT IT WAS NOT FOR HER TO TELL THEM SO ALTHOUGH IT TROUBLED HER A GOOD DEAL AND SHE COULD ONLY TRY TO MAKE UP FOR IT BY BEING AS DUTIFUL AND AFFECTIONATE AS IF THEIR GRANDMA WAS HER OWN
WE HAD HALF A DOZEN OTHER FROLICS THAT VERY SUMMER
VERY MUCH THE DEUCE YOU DO I M SO FOND OF MUSIC HOW CAN I HELP IT
BUT AS SHE LISTENED TO TOM'S HONEST VOICE GETTING GRUFF WITH REMORSE NOW AND THEN SHE COULD N'T HARDEN HER HEART AGAINST HIM OR REFUSE TO MAKE UP WHEN HE SO FRANKLY OWNED THAT IT WAS CONFOUNDED MEAN TO READ HER BOOK THAT WAY SHE LIKED HIS COMING AND BEGGING PARDON AT ONCE
I DON'T THINK SETTING UP FOR A FINE LADY WOULD SUIT HER I THINK IT WOULD AND I HOPE SHE LL HAVE THE CHANCE SAID FANNY EVIDENTLY MAKING AN EFFORT TO SPEAK KINDLY
YOU LOOK JUST AS I LIKE TO SEE A CHILD OF YOUR AGE LOOK
THESE LOVELY DAPHNES WILL GIVE ODOR TO MY CAMELLIAS AND YOU WERE A DEAR TO BRING THEM
THE GAS WAS TURNED DOWN BUT FANNY SAW A FIGURE IN A GRAY WRAPPER CREEP BY HER DOOR AND PRESENTLY RETURN PAUSING TO LOOK IN
YES IT IS SPLENDID
I GIVE YOU MY WORD I DID N'T
SHE SIGHED OVER THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS IN GENERAL AND CROAKED A LITTLE OVER HER TRIALS IN PARTICULAR BUT ON THE WHOLE GOT OVER HER LOSS BETTER THAN SHE EXPECTED FOR SOON SHE HAD OTHER SORROWS BESIDE HER OWN TO COMFORT AND SUCH WORK DOES A BODY MORE GOOD THAN FLOODS OF REGRETFUL TEARS OR HOURS OF SENTIMENTAL LAMENTATION
SO YOUR WAYS AIN'T LIKE OURS YOU SEE BEGAN FANNY FINDING IT RATHER HARD TO EXPLAIN
JOE JOY PROVIDED THE BADGES AND AUNT GOT OUT SOME OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WINE FROM THE OLD BEACON STREET CELLAR
THAT WAS BEFORE TRIX CAUGHT HIM
I DON'T KNOW BUT ONE THAT ALWAYS LOOKS SO AND THERE IT IS WHERE ASKED POLLY WITH INTEREST
BUT I DON'T LIKE HIM AS WELL AS HAWRY FISKE OH YES
HURRAH CRIED NELLY DANCING DOWN BELOW AS MY FIRST SHAKE SENT A DOZEN PLUMS RATTLING ROUND HER
POLLY'S CREED WAS VERY SIMPLE
AND MAUD DON'T EAT TOO MUCH SUPPER
I SHOULD N'T BE FIT TO GIVE LESSONS IF I WAS UP LATE SHOULD I
SHE IS A QUIET LITTLE OLD LADY BUT SHE DOES ONE HEAPS OF GOOD AND SHOWS YOU HOW TO BE CHARITABLE IN THE WISEST WAY DO TELL US ABOUT IT
YES IT DON'T HURT MUCH NOW AND POLLY DREW HER HAND AWAY SORRY HE HAD SEEN IT
NOW TO ME YOUR RUBBISH LOOKS VERY ENCOURAGING BECAUSE THERE IS GOOD MATERIAL THERE AND NOT MUCH WORN-OUT FINERY THAT S MY DETESTATION FOR YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT
YOU ARE VERY KIND
NEVER MIND WHAT ITS NAME WAS IT WAS VERY GORGEOUS VERY VULGAR AND VERY FASHIONABLE
SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FAULTS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT POLLY SPOKE HEARTILY NOW AND SYDNEY LOOKED AT HER AS IF FANNY'S DEFENDER PLEASED HIM MORE THAN FANNY'S DEFENCE
SO HE STUCK HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND KEPT IT THERE SO LONG THAT POLLY ASKED IF ANYTHING WAS THE MATTER
IT IS APT TO BE CAPRICIOUS AND JUST AS ONE GETS TO LIKING THE TASTE OF THIS INTOXICATING DRAUGHT IT SUDDENLY FAILETH AND ONE IS LEFT GASPING LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER AND KATE EMPHASIZED HER SPEECH BY SPEARING A SARDINE WITH A PENKNIFE AND EATING IT WITH A GROAN
BUTTER THE TOAST MAUDIE AND PUT THAT LITTLE COVER OVER IT
WHY NOT ASKED THE COUNTRY MOUSE OF THE CITY MOUSE WONDERING WHAT HARM THERE WAS IN LIKING OTHER PEOPLE'S PRETTY THINGS AND SAYING SO
A CLOUD PASSED OVER HIS FACE AND HE LEANED HIS CHIN ON HIS ARM AGAIN WITH A DESPONDENT WHISTLE AS HE SAID TO HIMSELF POOR FAN
THEN POLLY HEARD MR SHAW'S DEEPER VOICE SAY A FEW WORDS AT WHICH TOM UTTERED A LOUD EXCLAMATION AS IF TAKEN BY SURPRISE
OTHERWISE I MUST EXPECT THE CRUSHING CRITICISM WELL I DARE SAY IT S ALL VERY PRIM AND PROPER BUT IT IS N'T A BIT LIKE US AND NEVER HOPE TO ARRIVE AT THE DISTINCTION OF FINDING THE COVERS OF AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL THE DIRTIEST IN THE LIBRARY
FOR SHE FELT BOTH FRIGHTENED AND INDIGNANT AND SAT WITH HER EYES ON HER PLAY-BILL AND HER CHEEKS GETTING HOTTER AND HOTTER EVERY MINUTE
FRESH TRIMMING AND LESS OF IT WILL FINISH YOU OFF AS SMART AS EVER I NEVER WORE A TURNED DRESS IN MY LIFE
I WISH I HAD A TALENT TO LIVE FOR IF IT WOULD DO AS MUCH FOR ME AS IT DOES FOR THEM
GUESS IT IS
IT WAS ALL OVER IN A MINUTE OR TWO AND WHEN HE HAD HAD A GLASS OF WINE AND WAS NICELY SETTLED ON HIS BED HE FELT PRETTY COMFORTABLE IN SPITE OF THE PAIN IN HIS HEAD
SHE WORE A STEEL-COLORED SATIN TRIMMED WITH BLACK LACE AND ON HER CAP WAS PINNED A LAFAYETTE BADGE OF WHITE SATIN
I KNOW WHAT I M ABOUT AND TO SHOW HER THAT IT WAS ALL RIGHT I GAVE THE BAG A LITTLE SHAKE WHEN OUT FLEW THE NUTS RATTLING LIKE A HAIL-STORM ALL OVER THE UNCARPETED FLOOR
WITH HER OTHER HAND SHE CLUTCHED HER FROCK AND FOR A MINUTE HELD ON STOUTLY
A FEW BANGS AT THE LOCKED DOOR A FEW THREATS OF VENGEANCE FROM THE PRISONER SUCH AS SETTING THE HOUSE ON FIRE DRINKING UP THE WINE AND MASHING THE JELLY-POTS AND THEN ALL WAS SO QUIET THAT THE GIRLS FORGOT HIM IN THE EXCITING CRISIS OF THEIR WORK
WELL I DON'T KNOW
NO SHE THOUGHT IT WAS N'T THE THING FOR A POOR MINISTER'S GIRLS TO GO FLOURISHING ABOUT IN SECOND-HAND FINERY SO SHE DID WHAT I M DOING NOW PUT AWAY WHAT WOULD BE USEFUL AND PROPER FOR US BY AND BY AND LET US PLAY WITH THE SHABBY SILK BONNETS AND DIRTY FLOUNCED GOWNS
TRIX WAS ASHAMED OF HERSELF
MRS JONES FOUND MRS SMITH'S SHAWL IN HER ORCHARD WITH A HAMMER AND AN UNKNOWN TEAPOT NEAR IT
I LL REMEMBER AND USE THIS ONE
QUICK CRIED SALLY PANTING WITH HASTE
I WAS GOING TO WIPE IT OFF BUT SHE PUSHED MY HAND AWAY AND RAN TO THE GLASS WHERE SHE CAREFULLY DABBED IT DRY AND CAME BACK WITH ONE CHEEK REDDER THAN THE OTHER
MY OLD FRIEND MISS MILLS HAS TAKEN ME IN AND I AM NICELY SETTLED
FOR EVEN TURTLE DOVES PECK GALLANTLY TO DEFEND THEIR NESTS
SUCH DINNERS AND TEA PARTIES SUCH DAMASK TABLE CLOTHS AND FINE PLATE SUCH SOLID HANDSOME FURNITURE AND ELEGANT CARRIAGES
THOMAS LEAVE THE TABLE COMMANDED MR SHAW AS HIS INCORRIGIBLE SON GURGLED AND GASPED BEHIND HIS NAPKIN
AS FANNY WAS OUT A GOOD DEAL WITH HER ARTHUR WHO WAS SURE THAT EXERCISE WAS NECESSARY FOR THE CONVALESCENT POLLY WENT EVERY DAY TO SEE MRS SHAW WHO FOUND HERSELF LONELY THOUGH MUCH BETTER THAN USUAL FOR THE ENGAGEMENT HAD A FINER EFFECT UPON HER CONSTITUTION THAN ANY TONIC SHE EVER TRIED
SUCH A MINE OF RICHES
IT WAS ALL THE PLUM'S FAULT FOR IF IT HAD N'T FALLEN AT THAT MINUTE I NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAD THE THOUGHT WHICH POPPED INTO MY MISCHIEVOUS MIND
YES AND I LL TAKE HER TWO OR THREE CLUSTERS OF MY DAPHNE IT S SO SWEET UP GOT POLLY AND TAKING HER LITTLE POSY TROTTED AWAY TO THE SHAWS DETERMINED TO BE HAPPY AND CONTENTED IN SPITE OF TRIX AND HARD WORK
BUT I THINK THEY WATERED THAT SWEET SENTIMENT CALLED FRATERNAL LOVE WHICH TILL NOW HAD BEEN NEGLECTED IN THE HEARTS OF THIS BROTHER AND SISTER
THE SOONER IT S OVER THE BETTER FOR ME WAS THE ONLY THOUGHT POLLY HAD TIME FOR BEFORE SHE PLUNGED INTO THE ROOM ABOVE PROPELLED BY MAUD WHO CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY THERE HE IS
SHE THOUGHT SO HERSELF
THE LITTLE GIRLS TOOK A LOOK AT HER SEEMED SATISFIED AND ACCEPTED HER OFFER
SHE DID NOT TRY TO SETTLE THE QUESTION BUT DID HER BEST TO LOVE AND SERVE AND BEAR WITH EACH AND THE GOOD WILL THE GENTLE HEART THE HELPFUL WAYS AND SIMPLE MANNERS OF OUR POLLY MADE HER DEAR TO EVERY ONE FOR THESE VIRTUES EVEN IN A LITTLE CHILD ARE LOVELY AND ATTRACTIVE
YOU BEGAN TO BE A YOUNG LADY SO EARLY THAT YOU ARE TIRED OF EVERYTHING AT TWENTY-TWO
BUT SHE WAS N'T A BIT
LUNACY IS MIGHTY BECOMING POLLY
I KNOW HE WOULD IF HE HAD STAYED AT HOME LONGER AFTER HE GOT RID OF TRIX
NOW THAT HE HAD LOST HIS HERITAGE TOM SEEMED TO SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW GOODLY IT HAD BEEN HOW RICH IN POWER PLEASURE AND GRACIOUS OPPORTUNITIES
HAS SHE HAD A FORTUNE LEFT HER
BUT POLLY LIKED IT AND WHENEVER SHE FELT A LITTLE PENSIVE AT PARTING WITH HER FRIENDS SHE TOOK A PEANUT OR A PEEP AT TOM'S FUNNY PICTURE WHICH MADE HER MERRY AGAIN
AND HOWEVER SHALL I KNOW HER
OH HERE S THE PRETTY VIOLET SILK
CHAPTER X
HOW GOES IT AND REBECCA OFFERED A CLAY-DAUBED HAND WHICH THE NEW-COMER CORDIALLY SHOOK
BUT WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF IT AFTERWARD AND WONDERED WHAT HER OWN MOTHER WOULD HAVE SAID IF LITTLE KITTY HAD PUT SUCH A QUESTION SHE DID N'T FIND IT CUNNING OR FUNNY BUT RIDICULOUS AND UNNATURAL
WELL HE ASKED EM TO GIVE HIM SOME NEW ONES AND THEY DID GIVE HIM MONEY ENOUGH FOR A NICE PAIR
NO M
NEAT BUTTON-HOLES FAN
POLLY NEVER TEASES
SHE S DYING OF CONSUMPTION YOU KNOW BEGAN MISS MILLS AS HER NIMBLE FINGERS FLEW AND HER KIND OLD FACE BEAMED OVER THE WORK AS IF SHE PUT A BLESSING IN WITH EVERY STITCH
I D NO BUSINESS TO GET A NEW PAIR BUT I WANTED TO BE EXTRA GORGEOUS TO-NIGHT AND THIS IS MY PUNISHMENT FOR SUCH MAD EXTRAVAGANCE WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE ASKED TOM
I SHAN'T IF YOU DON'T GO AND TELL
BUT SHE HAD BEEN TAUGHT THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR OLD PEOPLE AND HAVING NO REASON FOR REFUSING SHE DIRECTLY WENT TO THE PIANO AND DID AS SHE WAS BID
I THINK A LITTLE FUN IS ALL RIGHT
BUT IT NEVER OCCURS TO US TO TRY AND MEND THE MATTER BY GETTING UP A BETTER SPIRIT BETWEEN MISTRESS AND MAID
THE INTEREST ON THAT SORT OF INVESTMENT ROLLS UP BEAUTIFULLY YOU KNOW
OUT I GOT AND CREEPING CAREFULLY ALONG TILL I CAME NEAR THE TREE I STOOD UP AND SUDDENLY CROWED LIKE THE LITTLE ROOSTER
I VE DANCED TOO MUCH LATELY AND DYSPEPSIA MAKES ME BLUE AND FANNY WIPED HER EYES AND LAUGHED
THERE S TOO MUCH JUICE SAID NELLY SHAKING HER HEAD WISELY
WITHOUT A WORD HE MADE A GRAB AT POLLY'S ARM FOR THE HAND HOLDING THE KEY WAS STILL IN HER POCKET
PUT A MAN'S HAND IN HERS TO HELP HER ALONG THEN SAID POLLY WHOSE HAPPY FORTUNE IT HAD BEEN TO FIND FRIENDS AND HELPERS IN FATHER AND BROTHERS
FANNY SMILED THEN GREW BOTH GRAVE AND SAD
I WISH YOU D GO AT SOMETHING THEN YOU D FIND HOW MUCH TALENT AND ENERGY YOU REALLY HAD I KNOW EVER SO MANY GIRLS WHO ARE JUST LIKE ME SICK TO DEATH OF FASHIONABLE LIFE BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TAKE IN ITS PLACE
BUT A FEW PEOPLE WITH EYES TO READ ROMANCES AND PLEASANT HISTORIES EVERYWHERE FOUND SOMETHING VERY ATTRACTIVE IN THIS COUPLE AND SMILED AS THEY PASSED WONDERING IF THEY WERE YOUNG LOVERS OR COUNTRY COUSINS LOOKING ROUND IF THE DAY WAS STORMY THEY STAYED AT HOME READING WRITING LETTERS TALKING OVER THEIR AFFAIRS AND GIVING EACH OTHER GOOD ADVICE
I ALWAYS DID LIKE YOU DON'T YOU KNOW EVER SINCE THAT FIRST VISIT BUT YOU TEASED ME SHAMEFULLY FOR ALL THAT SO I DID BUT I DON'T NOW POLLY DID NOT ANSWER AND TOM ASKED WITH MORE ANXIETY THAN THE OCCASION REQUIRED
YES AND HE ADDED I SHALL LET MY BOYS FOLLOW THE GUIDE THAT IS IN THEM AND ONLY ASK OF THEM TO USE THEIR GIFTS CONSCIENTIOUSLY AND BE HONEST USEFUL MEN SO WE WILL
I HOPE IN TIME TO HAVE AS MANY HANDS AS YOU SAID FAN GRATEFULLY WHEN THE SIMPLE BONNET WAS DONE AND EVERYTHING PLANNED OUT READY TO BE FINISHED
WHAT MADE HIM DIE POLLY ASKED TOM SOBERLY AFTER LITTLE PAUSE
KATY DON'T AMOOSE ME
AND THESE MITES OF FIVE AND SIX HAD THEIR MUSICALS THEIR PARTIES RECEPTIONS AND PROMENADES AS WELL AS THEIR ELDERS
NO ONE MISSED THEM
I SHALL GET USED TO IT PRESENTLY I DARE SAY MR SYDNEY GLANCED BACK RECOGNIZED THE COUPLE BEHIND THEM AND TURNED ROUND WITH A DISGUSTED EXPRESSION
MOTHER CALLED US BUT WE HAD PARADED OUT INTO THE GARDEN AFTER OUR BALL AND WERE HAVING A CONCERT AS WE SAT ABOUT ON THE CABBAGES FOR GREEN SATIN SEATS SO WE DID N'T HEAR THE CALL AND JUST AS THE COMPANY WAS GOING A GREAT NOISE ARRESTED THEM ON THE DOORSTEP AND ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE RATTLED NED IN FULL COSTUME WHEELING KITTY IN A BARROW WHILE JIMMY WILL AND I RAN SCREAMING AFTER LOOKING LIKE BEDLAMITES
BUT TOM TOOK IT AWAY AND MADE HER LAUGH INSTEAD OF CRY BY SAYING IN A WHEEDLESOME TONE I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DID AS MUCH FOR ALL YOUR ROMANCE
YOU VE GOT ME INTO A SCRAPE AND YOU OUGHT TO HELP ME OUT I WILL IF I CAN
MR SHAW STOOD ON THE RUG LOOKING RATHER GRIM
BUT THIS IS WARMER SO I WEAR IT EVERY DAY AND POLLY RAN INTO HER OWN ROOM TO PRINK ALSO FEARING THAT HER FRIEND MIGHT BE ASHAMED OF HER PLAIN COSTUME
YOU LEAD SUCH SAFE AND HAPPY LIVES YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THE MISERY THAT IS ALL ROUND YOU
MAUD'S RETURN PUT AN END TO THESE CONFIDENCES THOUGH TOM EXCITED HER CURIOSITY BY ASKING THE MYSTERIOUS QUESTION I SAY FAN IS POLLY UP TO THAT SORT OF THING NO SHE THINKS IT S AWFUL
TOM WAS POLLY'S ROCK AHEAD FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS BREAKING OUT IN A NEW PLACE AND ONE NEVER KNEW WHERE TO FIND HIM
BUT I SHOULD THINK SHE WOULD GET TIRED TO DEATH SITTING THERE MAKING HOODS AND PETTICOATS DAY AFTER DAY SAID FANNY AFTER THINKING OVER JENNY'S STORY FOR A FEW MINUTES FOR SEEING THE GIRL SEEMED TO BRING IT NEARER AND MAKE IT MORE REAL TO HER
DEAR ME
SHE HAS A FINE VOICE AND IS REALLY SUFFERING FOR A TEACHER A SLIGHT SMILE PASSED OVER POLLY'S FACE AS SHE RETURNED HER THANKS FOR THE NEW PUPIL FOR SHE REMEMBERED A TIME WHEN MRS SHAW CONSIDERED HER SWEET SONGS QUITE UNFIT FOR A FASHIONABLE YOUNG LADY'S REPERTOIRE
OH PLEASE SIR DON'T ASK ME
DON'T YOU THINK YOU AND MAUD HAD BETTER GO DOWN AND SEE HIM ASKED POLLY
AND THEN THEY HEARD EACH OTHER RECITE TILL BOTH WERE PERFECT THAT S PRETTY GOOD FUN SAID TOM JOYFULLY TOSSING POOR HARKNESS AWAY AND FEELING THAT THE PLEASANT EXCITEMENT OF COMPANIONSHIP COULD LEND A CHARM EVEN TO LATIN GRAMMAR
HE GETS CROSS AND ROUGH AND DISRESPECTFUL TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND PLAGUES US GIRLS AND IS SO HORRID I ALMOST HATE HIM
HE S GOOD TO POLLY ALWAYS AND PUTS ON HER CLOAK FOR HER AND SAYS MY DEAR AND KISSES HER GOOD-NIGHT AND DON'T THINK IT S SILLY AND I WISH I HAD A BROTHER JUST LIKE HIM YES I DO AND MAUD SHOWED SIGNS OF WOE FOR HER DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT GOING WAS VERY GREAT
WITH ALL HIS THOUGHTLESSNESS TOM WAS QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL THESE THINGS AND WAS NOT SPOILT ENOUGH YET TO LAUGH AT THEM
MOTHER SAYS A GREAT DEAL OF IT IS OWING TO BAD EDUCATION NOWADAYS BUT SOME GIRLS SEEM BORN FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF MAKING TROUBLE AND WOULD MANAGE TO DO IT IF THEY LIVED IN A HOWLING WILDERNESS
YES OF COURSE
DONE ECHOED POLLY
IT S GETTING LATE FOR THE CHICKEN HE ADDED RELAPSING INTO THE GRACEFUL DICTION WITH WHICH A CLASSICAL EDUCATION GIFTS ITS FORTUNATE POSSESSOR
I LL RUN UP AND HELP HER DRESS
BE SURE YOU GET THE BAG BY THE RIGHT END SAID SALLY
OH FAN I M GETTING SO ILL-TEMPERED AND ENVIOUS AND WICKED I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME I M NOT AFRAID FOR YOU MY DEAR AND I DO BELIEVE THINGS WILL GO RIGHT BECAUSE YOU ARE SO GOOD TO EVERY ONE
IT S JUST WHAT SHE LIKES AND IT PLEASES HER TO BE THOUGHT OF SAID MAUD SURVEYING HER GIFT WITH COMPLACENCY AS SHE PUT ON HER THINGS
AIN'T HE SPLENDID FOR A MINUTE EVERYTHING DANCED BEFORE POLLY'S EYES AS A HAND SHOOK HERS WARMLY AND A GRUFFISH VOICE SAID HEARTILY HOW ARE YOU POLLY THEN SHE SLIPPED INTO A CHAIR BESIDE MRS SHAW HOPING THAT HER REPLY HAD BEEN ALL RIGHT AND PROPER FOR SHE HAD NOT THE LEAST IDEA WHAT SHE SAID
I WON'T WALK WITH HIM ANY MORE
IT S TOO WET
THEN THEY HAD A LONG TALK FOR THE FAMILY TROUBLES SEEMED TO WARM AND STRENGTHEN THE FAMILY AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE AND AS THE YOUNG PEOPLE LISTENED WHILE MR SHAW TOLD THEM AS MUCH OF HIS BUSINESS PERPLEXITIES AS THEY COULD UNDERSTAND EVERY ONE OF THEM BLAMED HIM OR HERSELF FOR GOING ON SO GAYLY AND BLINDLY WHILE THE STORM WAS GATHERING AND THE POOR MAN WAS LEFT TO MEET IT ALL ALONE
WONDER IF OLD BELL DON'T WANT A CLERK FOR THE PARIS BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS
I DECLARE TO YOU POLLY THAT SORT OF CONFIDENCE IN HIMSELF AND ENERGY AND COURAGE IN A MAN OF HIS YEARS MAKES ME LOVE AND RESPECT THE DEAR OLD GENTLEMAN AS I NEVER DID BEFORE I M SO GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT TOM
NOW THEN GET OUT OF THE WAY IF YOU WON'T COME
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN THE LITTLE WITCH LAUGH IN HER SLEEVE WHEN ANY ONE ADMIRED THE DRESS FOR SHE WORE IT ALL SUMMER AND LOOKED AS PRETTY AS A PINK IN IT
IT BEGAN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND ONLY THOSE WHO HONESTLY FOLLOW THE BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE SET US THEN LEARN HOW TO GET GENUINE HAPPINESS OUT OF LIFE
THE BIG PIANO TOOK UP SO MUCH ROOM THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR A BED
PLEASE LET ME BE AS I AM AND DON'T LET PEOPLE COME AND LOOK AT ME
WILL YOU COME A SLEIGH-RIDE TOMORROW
WE WAITED A WEEK AND NO ONE CAME SO WE BEGAN TO FEEL RATHER SLIGHTED FOR OTHER PEOPLE GOT A SCARE AS TOM SAYS AND AFTER ALL OUR PREPARATIONS WE REALLY FELT A TRIFLE DISAPPOINTED THAT WE HAD HAD NO CHANCE TO SHOW OUR COURAGE
I COULD N'T WAIT ANOTHER MINUTE OR LET YOU EITHER AND I COULD N'T HELP STRETCHING OUT MY ARMS TO MY LITTLE WIFE GOD BLESS HER THOUGH I KNOW I DON'T DESERVE HER TOM'S VOICE GOT LOWER AND LOWER AS HE SPOKE AND HIS FACE WAS FULL OF AN EMOTION OF WHICH HE NEED NOT BE ASHAMED FOR A VERY SINCERE LOVE ENNOBLED HIM MAKING HIM HUMBLE WHERE A SHALLOWER AFFECTION WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD OF ITS SUCCESS
DON'T YOU THINK HE CARED FOR YOU DEAR ASKED FANNY PRESENTLY
FOR I WANT THEM TO LIKE ME THOUGH I M ONLY AN OLD-FASHIONED COUNTRY GIRL THAT LAST SENTENCE MADE FANNY SHUT THE BOOK WITH A FACE FULL OF SELF-REPROACH
YES I LL GET TWO TICKETS AS CHEAP AS I CAN SEND A NOTE TO WILL POOR LAD HE NEEDS FUN AS MUCH AS I DO AND WE LL GO AND HAVE A NICE TIME IN SOME CORNER AS CHARLES LAMB AND HIS SISTER USED TO WITH THAT POLLY SLAMMED DOWN THE WINDOW TO THE DISMAY OF HER GENTLE LITTLE PENSIONERS AND BEGAN TO FLY ABOUT WITH GREAT ENERGY SINGING AND TALKING TO HERSELF AS IF IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP QUIET
IT S REGULARLY SPLENDID
AND AS FOR PEACE I M NOT LIKELY TO GET MUCH WHILE I HAVE TOM TO LOOK AFTER SAID TRIX WITH AN AGGRAVATING LAUGH
SO I KNEW YOU DIRECTLY AND POLLY NODDED AT HIM IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER HAVING POLITELY REFRAINED FROM CALLING THE HAIR RED THE NOSE A PUG AND THE CAP OLD ALL OF WHICH FACTS FANNY HAD CAREFULLY IMPRESSED UPON HER MEMORY
FOR ON THE BACK OF HER GLOVE WAS STAMPED LAFAYETTE'S LIKENESS AND THE GALLANT OLD GENTLEMAN KISSED HIS OWN FACE
I CAME YESTERDAY AND HAVE BEEN GETTING MY NEST IN ORDER
FORTUNATELY SHE DID NOT HAVE TO DO VIOLENCE TO HER FEELINGS VERY LONG FOR THE FIRST THING FANNY SAID TO HER WAS
WE HAD BEEN VERY PRIM FOR A WEEK AND OUR BOTTLED UP SPIRITS COULD NO LONGER BE CONTAINED
FANNY HAD BEEN AFRAID THAT POLLY'S RETURN MIGHT ENDANGER HER HOPES BUT SYDNEY MET POLLY WITH THE OLD FRIENDLINESS AND VERY SOON CONVINCED HER THAT THE NIPPING IN THE BUD PROCESS HAD BEEN EFFECTUAL FOR BEING TAKEN EARLY THE SPROUTING AFFECTION HAD DIED EASY AND LEFT ROOM FOR AN OLDER FRIENDSHIP TO BLOSSOM INTO A HAPPIER LOVE
SHE HUNTED UP SOMETHING MORE PRESENTABLE AND SAID IN A DESPAIRING TONE WELL MOTHER IS VERY POORLY TOM AND TRIX QUARREL ALL THE TIME MAUD GETS MORE AND MORE WILFUL EVERY DAY AND PAPA IS WORRIED ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS A SAD STATE OF THINGS BUT NOTHING VERY DESPERATE
CAN'T HELP IT THAT S THE WAY AND SO IT MUST BE ANSWERED FAN PLANTING ANOTHER SPRIG HALF-WAY UP THE TOWER
IT WAS RATHER A SILENT DRIVE FOR WILL OBEDIENTLY KEPT HIS MUFFLER UP AND TOM FELL INTO A BROWN STUDY
THOUGH DAUGHTER SHAW IS AN INVALID AT FORTY THAT S THE WAY I WAS BROUGHT UP AND THAT S WHY FAN CALLS ME OLD-FASHIONED I SUPPOSE
THEN THERE WAS A BRIGHT DRUGGET OVER THE FADED CARPET THE LITTLE ROCKING-CHAIR AND SEWING-TABLE STOOD AT ONE WINDOW THE IVY RAN ALL OVER THE OTHER AND HID THE BANQUETING PERFORMANCES WHICH WENT ON IN THAT CORNER
PERHAPS I D BETTER THE MONEY WOULD BE AN IMMENSE HELP ONLY I DON'T QUITE LIKE TO TAKE IT KINGS AND QUEENS SELL THEIR JEWELS WHEN TIMES ARE HARD OR THEY GET TURNED OFF THEIR THRONES AND NO ONE THINKS IT ANYTHING AMISS SO WHY NEED YOU
TELL ME ALL YOU KNOW OF THIS ABSURD AFFAIR
HER MOTHER DIED A YEAR AGO AND SINCE THEN SHE HAS BEEN STRUGGLING ALONG ALONE
WHILE TOM PLAYED A BIG DRUM IN THE ORCHESTRA
THEY ARE NOT LOVE-LETTERS DEARY BUT NOTES FROM MY MATES AFTER I LEFT MISS COTTON'S BOARDING-SCHOOL
THROUGH MISS MILLS WHO WAS THE COUNSELLOR AND COMFORTER OF SEVERAL POLLY CAME TO KNOW A LITTLE SISTERHOOD OF BUSY HAPPY INDEPENDENT GIRLS WHO EACH HAD A PURPOSE TO EXECUTE A TALENT TO DEVELOP AN AMBITION TO ACHIEVE AND BROUGHT TO THE WORK PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE HOPE AND COURAGE
AND I THINK HE MUST BE VERY HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO DO SUCH A THING IT IS AN IMMENSE WEIGHT OFF MY SHOULDERS FOR SOME OF THOSE MEN COULD N'T AFFORD TO WAIT TILL I D BEGGED BORROWED OR EARNED THE MONEY
I DO WISH I COULD HAVE A NICE ROOM LIKE THIS AND A CAT AND A BIRD THAT WOULD N'T EAT EACH OTHER UP AND A DEAR LITTLE TEAKETTLE AND MAKE JUST AS MUCH TOAST AS I LIKE SUCH A PEAL OF LAUGHTER GREETED MAUD'S PENSIVE ASPIRATION THAT MISS MILLS SMILED OVER HER SOLITARY CUP OF TEA AND LITTLE NICK BURST INTO A PERFECT ECSTASY OF SONG AS HE SAT ON THE SUGAR-BOWL HELPING HIMSELF
NO IT IS N'T ANSWERED THE YOUNG LADY WITH A COOL STARE THAT UTTERLY QUENCHED HIM
CAN'T IT BE MADE UP
I VE NOT MADE A SOUND
WHY IT S A WHOLE YEAR SINCE I WENT HOME WITH YOU
WHICH AND TOM LOOKED ABOUT HIM BEWILDERED
HOW GOOD EVERYTHING WAS TO BE SURE
SHE READ IT SO WELL THAT THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN STOPPED MUNCHING TO REGARD HER WITH RESPECTFUL ASTONISHMENT AND WHEN SHE STOPPED HE SAID SUSPICIOUSLY YOU ARE A SLY ONE POLLY TO STUDY UP SO YOU CAN SHOW OFF BEFORE ME
NOTHING PARTICULAR
MY COUSIN HAD THREE KINDS OF WINE AT HER PARTY
I VE TAUGHT YOU THE STEPS A DOZEN TIMES
MR SHAW WAS VERY KIND TO HER FOR HE LIKED HER MODEST RESPECTFUL MANNERS
YOU EXTRAVAGANT WRETCH
SLOWLY
WHEN THE FIRST DANCE WAS CALLED FANNY CORNERED TOM WHO HAD BEEN DODGING HER FOR HE KNEW WHAT SHE WANTED AND SAID IN AN EARNEST WHISPER
MR SHAW CARRIED OUT HIS PLANS WITH AN ENERGY AND PATIENCE THAT WORKED WONDERS AND TOUCHED THE HEARTS OF HIS HARDEST CREDITORS
I MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO MATCH MY DRESS AND BLUE INSIDE SAID FANNY BRINGING OUT HER RIBBON BOXES
AS YOU CANNOT DO THAT PLEASE SEND ME A BOTTLE OF JUNE RAIN WATER FOR MY MAID TELLS ME IT IS BETTER THAN ANY COSMETIC FOR THE COMPLEXION AND MINE IS GETTING RUINED BY LATE HOURS
NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER
THEN A COMFORTABLE FORTUNE WAS LEFT HER AND SHE KNEW JUST HOW TO USE IT
IT S VERY WRONG BUT I CAN'T HELP IT HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT ASKED FANNY
THE BOY TURNED RED WITH PLEASURE AND PICKED AT THE BUTTONS ON HIS JACKET WHILE LISTENING TO THIS UNEXPECTED PRAISE
THERE S ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH FUSS MADE ABOUT CHARITY
YOUNG SINGERS DREAMING OF TRIUMPHS GREAT AS THOSE OF JENNY LIND
TRIX TURNED RED
I M TALKING ABOUT SYD WELL I M NOT YOU D BETTER TRY FOR HIM I LL THINK OF IT OH POLLY POLLY WHAT ARE YOU COMING TO A TUMBLE INTO THE STREET APPARENTLY ANSWERED POLLY AS SHE SLIPPED A LITTLE ON THE STEP AND TOM STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS LAUGH TO PILOT HER SAFELY INTO THE CARRIAGE WHERE FANNY WAS ALREADY SEATED
AND OUR DAYS WERE MUCH LONGER IN THE LAND THAN NOW IT SEEMS TO ME THE OLD LADY APPEARED TO FORGET POLLY AT THE END OF HER SPEECH
IF HE ONLY COULD COME BACK POOR POLLY'S EYES HAD BEEN GETTING FULLER AND FULLER LIPS TREMBLING MORE AND MORE AS SHE WENT ON
IN LIFTING HER ARMS TO PERK UP THE BOW AT HER THROAT SHE KNOCKED A HAT OFF THE BRACKET
YOU LL WRITE TO NED TO-MORROW WILL YOU
BUT MAUD CLAMORED FOR HER CANDY AND FINDING SHE COULD DO NOTHING TO APPEASE FAN POLLY DEVOTED HER MIND TO HER COOKERY TILL THE NUTS WERE SAFELY IN AND A NICE PANFUL SET IN THE YARD TO COOL
YES THAT S LITTLE JANE RETURNED POLLY ADDING WHEN SHE HAD PASSED WITH A NOD AND A FRIENDLY DON'T GET TIRED JENNY WE HELP ONE ANOTHER AT OUR HOUSE AND EVERY FINE MORNING JENNY TAKES JOHNNY KEAN OUT WHEN SHE GOES FOR HER OWN WALK
IF YOU DON'T MIND I LL WALK DOWN WITH YOU
AND FANNY LEFT ALONE TO WRESTLE WITH HOUSEKEEPING HELP AND HEARTACHE
POLLY ARRIVES CHAPTER 2
IF SHE WANTED TO BUY THAT HORRID NEW GOOSEBERRY-COLORED GOWN AS TOM CALLS IT I D LET HER HAVE IT CHEAP PUT IN MAUD WHO WAS OF A PRACTICAL TURN
BUT IF IT IS N'T CRIED FAN UNABLE TO ENDURE THE SIGHT
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING TO YOUR PRECIOUS LITTLE SELF PERSISTED FANNY TROUBLED BY THE CHANGE YET FINDING IT HARD TO SAY WHEREIN IT LAY
IT IS A DELUSION AND A SNARE
DID ANY ONE SEE YOU CRIED FANNY
POLLY RAN TO MR SHAW AND DANCED BEFORE HIM SAYING EAGERLY WAS N'T IT SPLENDID
AND PERHAPS WHEN I VE PROVED THAT I CAN DO SOMETHING AND AM NOT ASHAMED TO WORK THEN IF POLLY IS FREE I SHAN'T BE AFRAID TO TRY MY CHANCE SO I HELD MY TONGUE WORKED LIKE A HORSE SATISFIED MYSELF AND OTHERS THAT I COULD GET MY LIVING HONESTLY AND THEN CAME HOME TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY HOPE FOR ME AND I WAS WAITING FOR YOU ALL THE TIME SAID A SOFT VOICE CLOSE TO HIS SHOULDER
WOULD NOT HAVE RECOGNIZED IT BUT IT DID VERY WELL FOR A BEGINNER AND POLLY UNDERSTOOD THAT NIGHT WHEREIN THE FASCINATION OF IT LAY FOR SHE FELT AS IF SHE HAD FOUND A NEW GIFT ALL OF A SUDDEN AND WAS LEARNING HOW TO USE IT KNOWING THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS YET FINDING ITS CHIEF CHARM IN THAT VERY FACT
LESSONS ALL DAY A HIGHLY INSTRUCTIVE LECTURE BOOKS OVER A SOLITARY FIRE OR MUSIC WITH NO AUDIENCE BUT A SLEEPY CAT AND A BIRD WITH HIS HEAD TUCKED UNDER HIS WING FOR EVENING ENTERTAINMENT WAS NOT EXACTLY WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED FESTIVE
THAT LAST BIT OF ACTING UPSET THE WHOLE CONCERN FOR AS SHE TOSSED HER ARMS SHE SHOWED THE BIG RED CUSHION ON HER BREAST
FOR IT RECALLED THE HAPPIER BIRTHDAYS WHICH SEEMED VERY FAR AWAY NOW
I M SURE YOU KNOW FOR SHE WAS DOWN HERE A LITTLE WHILE AGO SAID FANNY
I WON'T STAND THIS TOM PAUSED AS POLLY SPOKE EVIDENTLY ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
FOR NEITHER YOU NOR FAN GAVE US POOR FELLOWS THE LEAST HINT ABOUT SYD AND THERE I VE BEEN HAVING ALL SORTS OF SCARES ABOUT YOU SERVES US RIGHT
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY EITHER BEGAN FAN
BUT HE DON'T CARE A HANG AND NEVER EVEN ASKED IF I DID WELL LAST DECLAMATION DAY WHEN I D GONE AND LEARNED THE BATTLE OF LAKE REGILLUS BECAUSE HE SAID HE LIKED IT OH TOM
DON'T THINK LATE EVENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED YET
DO BE QUIET CHILDREN
NOBODY EVER KNEW HOW MUCH GOOD IT DID HIM
BUT HOW COULD SHE
BUT YOU LL GET USED TO IT AS I DID I LL NEVER COME AGAIN SAID POLLY DECIDEDLY
FAN'S BEST VELVET JACKET AND HAT ERMINE MUFF AND A SOFA-PILLOW FOR PANNIER FINISHED OFF THE COSTUME AND TRIPPING ALONG WITH ELBOWS OUT TOM APPEARED BEFORE THE AMAZED POLLY JUST AS THE CHAPTER ENDED
DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST VISIT I MADE AT YOUR HOUSE HOW YOU GAVE ME PEANUTS COMING FROM THE DEPOT AND FRIGHTENED ME OUT OF MY WITS PRETENDING THE COACHMAN WAS TIPSY ASKED POLLY
SING IT TO ME MY DEAR
TRIX LOOKED QUITE SUBDUED
ALL OF A SUDDEN A VOICE CALLED POLLY AND THAT YOUNG LADY STARTED OUT OF HER CHAIR AS IF THE SOUND HAD BEEN A THUNDER-CLAP
THEY CALL ME OLD-FASHIONED NOW AND I D RATHER BE THOUGHT THAT THOUGH IT IS N'T PLEASANT THAN BE SET DOWN AS A RAMPANT WOMAN'S RIGHTS REFORMER SAID POLLY IN WHOSE MEMORY MANY LAUGHS AND SNUBS AND SARCASMS STILL LINGERED FORGIVEN BUT NOT FORGOTTEN
BESS IS TO BE MARRIED IN THE SPRING AND BECKY IS TO LIVE WITH HER BY THE WAY POLLY I VE GOT SOME TICKETS FOR YOU
AND BY JUPITER
DO YOU THINK YOUR FATHER WILL LIKE THIS PLAN PRETTY SURE HE WILL
I LL SHOW YOU HOW AND FORGETTING HER HATE AND CONTEMPT FOR DOLLS DOWN SAT FANNY SOON GETTING AS MUCH ABSORBED AS EITHER OF THE OTHERS
OH DEAR WHAT SHOULD WE DO IF WILL GOT INTO SUCH SCRAPES
IT S A NICE DAY AND WE LL HAVE A WALK WON'T WE BY THE TIME POLLY'S WELCOME WAS UTTERED SHE HAD GOT FAN ON THE LITTLE SOFA BESIDE HER AND WAS SMILING AT HER IN SUCH AN INFECTIOUS MANNER THAT FAN COULD N'T HELP SMILING BACK
I DON'T BELIEVE IT
FOR I M GOING TO HAVE NEEDLE PEN PALETTE AND BROOM SOMEWHERE TO SUGGEST THE VARIOUS TALENTS SHE OWNS AND THE BALLOT-BOX WILL SHOW THAT SHE HAS EARNED THE RIGHT TO USE THEM
FAN TOLD ME NOT TO GO NEAR HER CAUSE MY WED DWESS MAKES HER PINK ONE LOOK UGLY
IF POLLY LIKES
KEEP STEP WITH ME THEN AND DON'T TREAD ON MY TOES PLEADED POLLY
AND I WANT TO LOOK NICE WHEN POLLY COMES YOU DON'T EXPECT ME TO GO AND BRING HOME A STRANGE GIRL ALONE DO YOU AND TOM LOOKED AS MUCH ALARMED AS IF HIS SISTER HAD PROPOSED TO HIM TO ESCORT THE WILD WOMAN OF AUSTRALIA
SHE WON'T
THEY WERE SITTING ABOUT THE FIRE AFTER DINNER AND ALL LOOKED AS IF A LITTLE SUNSHINE WOULD DO THEM GOOD
YOU VE GOT THE SCAR OF THAT YET I SEE I REMEMBER HOW YOU STOOD BY ME WHILE IT WAS SEWED UP
HE S AN AWFUL BOY MY DEAR
NO WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT
HE CAN'T HAVE TIME FOR MUCH OF THAT FUN HE S SO BUSY NED WRITES GOOD GOSSIPY LETTERS I TAUGHT HIM HOW AND HE TELLS ME ALL THAT S GOING ON
I DEEPLY REGRET BEING OBLIGED TO SHOCK THE EYES AND EARS OF SUCH OF MY READERS AS HAVE A PREJUDICE IN FAVOR OF PURE ENGLISH BY EXPRESSIONS LIKE THE ABOVE BUT HAVING RASHLY UNDERTAKEN TO WRITE A LITTLE STORY ABOUT YOUNG AMERICA FOR YOUNG AMERICA I FEEL BOUND TO DEPICT MY HONORED PATRONS AS FAITHFULLY AS MY LIMITED POWERS PERMIT
I WAS ONLY TEASING YOU IN FUN
MADAM SHAW A QUIET OLD LADY WITH AN IMPOSING CAP EXCLAIMED ON SEEING POLLY BLESS MY HEART
OLD MR COOLIDGE SENT IN A CLOTHES-BASKET FULL
EACH FIRM AND DARK SPICY AND RICH UNDER THE FROSTY RIME ABOVE
ANOTHER THORN THAT WOUNDED OUR POLLY IN HER FIRST ATTEMPT TO MAKE HER WAY THROUGH THE THICKET THAT ALWAYS BARS A WOMAN'S PROGRESS WAS THE DISCOVERY THAT WORKING FOR A LIVING SHUTS A GOOD MANY DOORS IN ONE'S FACE EVEN IN DEMOCRATIC AMERICA
YOU LOOK VERY NICE
FANNY'S FRIENDSHIP GREW COOLER AFTER THAT NIGHT
CATCH ME BOTHERING ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS ANOTHER TIME
THIS IT WAS THAT CAUSED SUCH SUDDEN INDIGNATION AT FANNY'S DREADFUL SPEECH AND THIS IT WAS THAT MADE QUICK-TEMPERED POLLY TRY TO CALM HER WRATH BEFORE SHE USED TOWARD FANNY'S MOTHER THE DISRESPECTFUL TONE SHE SO RESENTED TOWARD HER OWN
THERE ARE GENTLEMEN AMONG THEM AND IT WOULD N'T BE PROPER SAID POLLY ALARMED AT THE IDEA
GOOD CRIED TOM APPLAUDING WITH THE WOODEN SPOON
VERY WARM IS N'T IT HE SAID WHEN HE HAD SHAKEN HANDS AND FALLEN INTO STEP JUST IN THE OLD WAY
IT S ONLY PART OF THE FUN SO DON'T YOU LAUGH YOU DISRESPECTFUL BOY SHE WHISPERED BACK IN A TONE NEVER USED TOWARD SYDNEY
TOM WHO STOOD BY HER IDLY SPINNING THE CURTAIN TASSEL FOLLOWED THE FAMILIAR FIGURE WITH HIS EYE AND SEEING HOW GRAY THE HAIR HAD GROWN HOW CAREWORN THE FLORID FACE AND HOW LIKE A WEARY OLD MAN HIS ONCE STRONG HANDSOME FATHER WALKED HE WAS SMITTEN BY A NEW PANG OF SELF-REPROACH AND WITH HIS USUAL IMPETUOSITY SET ABOUT REPAIRING THE OMISSION AS SOON AS HE DISCOVERED IT
AT THAT MINUTE MADAM SHAW CAME IN AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO THE LITTLE GIRL
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE HE HAD READ AND COMFORTED HERSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE DID NOT CARE FOR HER VERY MUCH SINCE HE TOOK THE FIRST REBUFF SO QUICKLY
WELL I DON'T CARE I LL GO SOMEWHERE FOR I WILL HAVE MY FUN SHE SAID WITH GREAT DETERMINATION FOR DISAPPOINTMENT ONLY SEEMED TO WHET HER APPETITE
THE IRREGULAR LIFE I HAVE LED SINCE MY COMING TO THIS PLACE HAS QUITE DESTROYED MY APPETITE
YES SHE ADDED I KEPT WISHING I COULD MEET YOU JUST TO SEE YOUR HORRIFIED FACE WHEN YOU SAW ME SITTING ON MY LITTLE SOFA WITH BOXES AND BUNDLES ALL ROUND ME A BIRD-CAGE ON ONE SIDE A FISHING BASKET WITH A KITTEN'S HEAD POPPING IN AND OUT OF THE HOLE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND JOLLY OLD MR BROWN IN HIS BLUE FROCK PERCHED ON A KEG OF APPLES IN FRONT
I HEARD MRS SMYTHE PERKINS SAY IT WAS CHARMING
IT S THE MEANEST THING I EVER SAW
I DO HOPE SHE WILL GET SCHOLARS ENOUGH TO BEGIN RIGHT AWAY SAID MAUD
COME DO NOW URGED TOM HEARTILY
AND HAVING EXAMINED ALL THE PRETTY THINGS ABOUT HER BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN OVER THE SOFT FLOWERY CARPET HUMMING TO HERSELF AS THE DAYLIGHT FADED AND ONLY THE RUDDY GLOW OF THE FIRE FILLED THE ROOM
EVERYBODY SHOWS YOU THEIR GOOD SIDE I THINK AND THAT IS WHY YOU FIND THE WORLD SUCH A PLEASANT PLACE OH BUT I DON'T
HE S ONLY A BOY AND DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS YET
MY BONNET
AND SO MUCH GOOD-WILL AFFECTION AND KINDLY FORETHOUGHT WAS PACKED AWAY IN THE TEMPTING BUNDLES THAT NO ONE COULD FEEL OFFENDED BUT WOULD FIND AN UNUSUAL CHARM ABOUT THE PRETTY GIFTS THAT MADE THEM DOUBLY WELCOME
I FORGOT MY POSIES IN ADMIRING THE BELLES
IS THE FACE BETTER DO YOU THINK SAID BECKY TAKING OFF A WET CLOTH AND SHOWING THE HEAD OF THE STATUE
SAY FATHER WE NEVER CALLED HIM PAPA
SO HE IS
YES MISS MILLS LETS ME HAVE A LITTLE ROOM UP STAIRS AND THERE I HAVE MY CAT AND BIRD MY PIANO AND MY POSY POTS AND LIVE LIKE A QUEEN
THIS WILL BE A COUNTRY SUPPER GIRLS SAID POLLY BUSTLING ABOUT
AND I WARMED MINE AT THE WEGISTER AND THEN IT WAS NICE
POLLY LOOKS AS IF SHE DID N'T BELIEVE IT
IT WAS COVERED WITH ALL SORTS OF FINERY FOR SHE HAD DRESSED IN A HURRY AND LEFT EVERYTHING TOPSY-TURVY
BUT THIS FALSE IDEA OF SELF-SACRIFICE DID NOT SATISFY FOR SHE WAS NOT A FASHIONABLE GIRL TRAINED TO BELIEVE THAT HER FIRST DUTY WAS TO MAKE A GOOD MATCH AND NEVER MIND THE CONSEQUENCES THOUGH THEY RENDERED HER MISERABLE FOR LIFE
THEN SHE SCALDED POOR PUTTEL BY UPSETTING HER COFFEE-POT
HERE WAS A CHANCE TO PROVE THAT SHE WAS N'T
HAVE N'T A BLESSED THING NOW BUT DECENT FRENCH AND MY FISTS
NO I AIN'T
IT WAS SO NICE AND WE LEARNED SO FAST TELL ME ABOUT JIMMY
GO AHEAD AND SEE HOW SHE COMES DOWN ON YOU MA'AM RETORTED TOM WHO HAD READ ON A BIT
THEY GOT ON CAPITALLY NOW FOR TOM WAS IN HIS PROPER SPHERE AND SHOWED HIS BEST SIDE BEING CIVIL AND GAY IN THE BLUFF BOY-FASHION THAT WAS NATURAL TO HIM
HALF THE AWFUL STORIES IN THE PAPERS ARE MADE UP FOR A SENSATION AND IT S ABSURD TO BELIEVE THEM UNLESS ONE LIKES TO BE HARROWED UP
FOR IF I VE GOT TO MAKE SOMETHING FOR EVERY ONE I MUST BEGIN RIGHT AWAY OR I SHAN'T GET DONE AND OFF SHE BUSTLED GLAD TO FORGET HER REMORSE IN HARD WORK
WELL SHE DID THE FORSAKEN VERY PRETTILY
SHE WILL MAKE A CHARMING LITTLE WOMAN IF SHE IS N'T SPOILT NO DANGER OF THAT
PERKY ADORES HIM AND WAS MAD ENOUGH TO BEAT BETSEY WHEN SHE TOLD THE STORY AND GIGGLED OVER IT
AND THE FEW PLAYS SHE HAD SEEN WERE THE GOOD OLD FAIRY TALES DRAMATIZED TO SUIT YOUNG BEHOLDERS LIVELY BRIGHT AND FULL OF THE HARMLESS NONSENSE WHICH BRINGS THE LAUGH WITHOUT THE BLUSH
NOW THERE IS A RICH WOMAN WHO KNEW HOW TO GET HAPPINESS OUT OF HER MONEY SAID POLLY AS THEY WALKED AWAY
BUT SHE WAS NOT RESENTFUL AND AFTER THE FIRST FLASH WAS OVER SHE SOON BEGAN TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT
BUT I DO
YOU RE A GOOD LITTLE SOUL TO REMEMBER POOR MUM SAID TOM WITH AN APPROVING NOD
SOMETHING TROUBLES YOU POLLY WHAT IS IT
TOM RECITING HIS BATTLE-PIECE
BUT SOMEHOW LATELY SHE IS ALWAYS BRIGHT AND HAPPY SEEMS TO LIKE HER WORK AND DON'T HAVE THE TIRED WORRIED LOOK SHE USED TO AT FIRST
BUT PAPA SAYS HE CAN'T AFFORD IT SO I CAN ONLY DRAG ABOUT AND GET ON AS I MAY I PITY YOU RICH GIRLS SO MUCH YOU HAVE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES AND DON'T SEEM TO KNOW HOW TO USE THEM
WHAT A DISRESPECTFUL WAY TO SPEAK OF THAT GREAT MAN SAID GRANDMA SHOCKED AT YOUNG AMERICA'S IRREVERENCE
GOOD-BY BACK TO DINNER AND WITH A HASTY KISS TOM WAS OFF
GRANDMA SAYS YOUR MOTHER IS A PERFECT LADY AND YOU ARE JUST LIKE HER
COME IT WILL AMUSE YOU I WILL CRIED FANNY WHOSE SPIRITS SEEMED IMPROVED BY THE SHOWER
WE MAKE OUR OWN CAKES IN A GREAT MEASURE THEREFORE LET US LOOK TO IT MY BRETHREN THAT THEY ARE MIXED ACCORDING TO THE BEST RECEIPT BAKED IN A WELL REGULATED OVEN AND GRATEFULLY EATEN WITH A TEMPERATE APPETITE GOOD
DID YOU EVER SELL YOUR CAST-OFF FINERY AS MANY LADIES DO ASKED POLLY
AND FANNY CLUTCHED POLLY WHISPERING YOU MUST COME
WHEN SUPPER WAS ANNOUNCED POLLY HAPPENED TO BE TALKING OR TRYING TO TALK TO ONE OF THE POKY GENTLEMEN WHOM FAN HAD INTRODUCED
BUT BELOW THE LIGHT-HEARTEDNESS EACH CHERISHED A PURPOSE WHICH SEEMED TO ENNOBLE HER WOMANHOOD TO GIVE HER A CERTAIN POWER A SUSTAINING SATISFACTION A DAILY STIMULUS THAT LED HER ON TO DAILY EFFORT AND IN TIME TO SOME SUCCESS IN CIRCUMSTANCE OR CHARACTER WHICH WAS WORTH ALL THE PATIENCE HOPE AND LABOR OF HER LIFE
YES DEAR
IT DID SOUND PLEASANT EVEN TO POLLY'S EARS AND SHE FELT SUDDENLY SO RICH AND SO CONTENTED THAT SHE SEEMED A DIFFERENT CREATURE FROM THE SILLY GIRL WHO CRIED BECAUSE SHE COULD N'T GO TO THE PARTY
I LL SEE THAT HE DON'T STUDY TOO HARD AND TOM'S EYES TWINKLED AS THEY USED TO DO WHEN HE PLANNED HIS BOYISH PRANKS
DO YOU GO AND TELL YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER EVERYTHING RIGHT OUT YES I DO
WHY I THOUGHT HE WAS VERY PLEASANT AND KIND AND POLLY OPENED HER EYES WITH A SURPRISED EXPRESSION
DID YOU DO IT FOR MY SAKE AND POLLY HELD HER CLOSE SAYING IN THAT TENDER VOICE OF HERS I DID N'T MEAN TO LET A LOVER PART THIS PAIR OF FRIENDS IF I COULD HELP IT CHAPTER XV
I M GLAD OF IT
I M SO GLAD CRIED POLLY CLAPPING HER HANDS REGARDLESS OF THE EGG SHE HELD WHICH DROPPED AND SMASHED ON THE FLOOR AT HER FEET
IT S A PRETTY NAME BUT RATHER TOO FINE AND I SHOULD N'T DARE TO SAY SYD AS HIS SISTER DOES
NOW PUT THE FLOWERS JUST HERE AND FANNY LAID A PINK CAMELLIA IN A NEST OF FUZZ AND STUCK A SPRAY OF DAPHNE STRAIGHT UP AT THE BACK OF HER HEAD
BUT I SHOULD N'T LAUGH AT A GIRL'S CLOTHES BECAUSE SHE WAS POOR OR KEEP HER OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE SHE DID N'T DO JUST AS OTHER GIRLS DO HERE
NOW THERE S A GIRL WHO TRIED A DIFFERENT CURE FOR UNREQUITED AFFECTION FROM ANY YOU MENTION
IT ALL BEGAN WITH POLLY'S STUPIDITY AS FAN SAID AFTERWARD
WHAT PARTICULARLY PLEASES ME IS THAT YOU HAVE KEPT YOUR PROMISE TO YOUR MOTHER AND HAVE N'T LET ANYONE PERSUADE YOU TO WEAR BORROWED FINERY
I WON'T THINK OF MYSELF OR TRY TO MEND ONE MISTAKE BY MAKING ANOTHER SHE SAID WITH A HEAVY SIGH
AND THE AUDIENCE ALL WORE THE FACES OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER LOOKING SORROWFULLY AT HER WITH EYES LIKE SAUCERS AND FACES AS RED AS FANNY'S SASH
I VE NO RIGHT TO TELL FAN'S SECRETS AND I M ASHAMED TO TELL MINE
I WANT TO HAVE A FEASIBLE PLAN ALL READY BEFORE I SPEAK TO FATHER
AT LAST THEY BEGAN TO BURST THE WATER GOT A LOVELY PURPLE WE PUT LOTS OF SUGAR IN AND KEPT TASTING TILL OUR APRONS AND FACES WERE RED AND OUR LIPS BURNT WITH THE HOT SPOONS
BECKY TOOK AN ARTISTIC SURVEY OF THE NEW-COMER WITH EYES THAT SEEMED TO SEE EVERYTHING
I HAVE N'T SEEN A LITTLE GIRL FOR SO LONG IT DOES MY OLD EYES GOOD TO LOOK AT YOU POLLY THOUGHT THAT A VERY ODD SPEECH AND COULD N'T HELP SAYING ARE N'T FAN AND MAUD LITTLE GIRLS TOO OH DEAR NO
AND WHEN FANNY DISCOVERED THEM MAUD WAS LAUGHING WITH ALL HER HEART AT POOR CLARA WHO DENUDED OF HER FINERY WAS CUTTING UP ALL SORTS OF CAPERS IN THE HANDS OF HER MERRY LITTLE MISTRESS
AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE APPOINTED EVENING SEVERAL OF US PROFESSED GREAT WEARINESS AND WENT TO OUR ROOM LEAVING THE REST SEWING VIRTUOUSLY WITH MISS COTTON WHO READ HANNAH MORE'S SACRED DRAMAS ALOUD IN A WAY THAT FITTED THE LISTENERS FOR BED AS WELL AS A DOSE OF OPIUM WOULD HAVE DONE
I HAVE N'T READ EITHER YOU MUST THEN
WHAT WILL PREVENT IT MARIA BAILEY WAS THE TRAGIC REPLY
I D LIKE TO SEE EM TRY IT AND TOM CLENCHED HIS HANDS AS IF IT WOULD BE AN IMMENSE RELIEF TO HIM TO THRASH HALF A DOZEN ASPERSERS OF HIS FATHER'S HONEST NAME
ADIEU DEAR MARY
I M AFRAID THERE IS SOMETHING IN IT
THEN I WON'T AND POLLY RETIRED BEHIND A CLOUD OF ARSENIC-GREEN GAUZE WHICH MADE HER LOOK AS IF SHE HAD THE CHOLERA
TO BE SURE THEY BELONGED TO HER NEIGHBORS AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO ASK LEAVE BUT IT WAS A NATIONAL AFFAIR
HAVING BEEN EDUCATED ABROAD IT REALLY SEEMS LIKE COMING TO A STRANGE CITY
I WON'T MAKE ANY BARGAIN AND I WILL TELL RETURNED TOM SEIZED WITH A SUDDEN FIT OF MORAL FIRMNESS
AS SHE WAS BRUSHING HER HAIR AT BEDTIME THERE CAME A TAP ON HER DOOR AND OPENING IT SHE BEHELD NOTHING BUT A TALL BLACK BOTTLE WITH A STRIP OF RED FLANNEL TIED ROUND IT LIKE A CRAVAT AND A COCKED-HAT NOTE ON THE CORK
POLLY SAYS SHE IS N'T NEEDED AT HOME NOW THE FAMILY IS SO SMALL AND KITTY CAN TAKE HER PLACE NICELY
YOU KNOW SHE LETS HER ROOMS WITHOUT BOARD BUT SHE IS GOING TO GIVE ME MY DINNERS AND I M TO GET MY OWN BREAKFAST AND TEA QUITE INDEPENDENTLY
IS THAT TRUE ASKED MR SHAW TURNING SUDDENLY TO POLLY
I M VERY GLAD TO HEAR IT AND WILLINGLY TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT
BUT I GUESS HE WOULD N'T MIND MY TAKING POOR MAUD INSTEAD
DON'T BE CROSS DEAR BUT COME AND DO SOMETHING NICE IT S SO DULL TO-DAY SAID FANNY ANXIOUS TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN FOR IT WAS DOUBLY DULL WITHOUT POLLY
YOU LIKE TO HEAR SECRETS SO TELL ME YOURS AND I LL BE AS DUMB AS AN OYSTER IT IS N'T A SECRET AND YOU WOULD N'T CARE FOR IT
SOME TIME AGO WE GOT INTO A FAMOUS TALK ABOUT WHAT WOMEN SHOULD BE AND BECKY SAID SHE D SHOW US HER IDEA OF THE COMING WOMAN
AS SHE PAUSED A MINUTE IN THE HALL TO STEADY HERSELF MAUD CALLED HER FROM ABOVE AND THINKING THAT THE WOMEN MIGHT NEED HER MORE THAN THE MEN SHE RAN UP TO FIND FANNY WAITING FOR HER IN HER OWN ROOM
SAINT MEHITABLE I CALL HER
I WISH I HAD N'T SAID ANYTHING STAMMERED POLLY REMEMBERING THE PROMISE GIVEN TO FANNY THE DAY OF THE CONCERT
POLLY DID NOT SOLILOQUIZE ALOUD AS HEROINES ON THE STAGE AND IN BOOKS HAVE A WAY OF DOING BUT THE CONVERSATION SHE HELD WITH HERSELF WAS VERY MUCH LIKE THIS
THIS FACT WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE RAPTUROUS MOOD IN WHICH POLLY FOUND HERSELF WHEN AFTER MAKING HER BONNET WASHING AND IRONING HER BEST SET BLACKING HER BOOTS AND MENDING HER FAN SHE AT LAST LIKE CONSUELO PUT ON A LITTLE DRESS OF BLACK SILK AND WITH THE SMALLER ADORNMENTS PINNED UP IN A PAPER STARTED FOR THE SHAWS FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO WALK DECOROUSLY WHEN HER HEART WAS DANCING IN HER BOSOM
WELL PEARS TO ME POLLY DID
BOTH WERE VERY ANGRY AND KEPT TWITTING ONE ANOTHER WITH EVERY AGGRAVATION THEY COULD INVENT AS THEY SCOLDED AND SCUFFLED PRESENTING A MOST UNLOVELY SPECTACLE
FANNY APPLIED HERSELF TO HER DUTIES WITH REDOUBLED ARDOR FOR A
I M A GOOSE POLLY AND I LL GET OVER THE FEELING THAT IT S SORT OF DISGRACEFUL TO BE POOR AND HAVE TO ECONOMIZE
THEN ON LOOKING INTO HER PURSE SHE SAW ONE DOLLAR AND THE LIST OF THINGS SHE MEANT TO GET FOR MOTHER AND THE CHILDREN
YES IT S THE PLEASANTEST WALK WE HAVE
I LL TELL ABOUT HIM SOME OTHER TIME
GO UP DEARY AND AMUSE YOURSELF WITH THIS BOOK AND THESE GINGER SNAPS THAT I MADE FOR YOU THERE S A GOOD CHILD WHISPERED POLLY AS MAUD RUBBED AWAY HER TEARS AND STARED AT TOM WITH ROUND INQUISITIVE EYES
POOR THINGS
I WENT AND FOUND MARY THE PICKET GUARD HALF ASLEEP AND LONGING FOR HER SHARE OF THE FEAST
THAT WAS A TWO-EDGED THRUST FOR TRIX WAS DECIDEDLY AN OLD GIRL AND TOM WAS GENERALLY REGARDED AS A HAPLESS VICTIM
I ARRANGED IT WITH YOUR MOTHER WHILE YOU WERE UPSTAIRS I WANT TO SEE EVERYTHING SAID MAUD WHEN THE HATS WERE OFF AND THE HANDS WARMED
OLD TOM WILL PAY FOR HIS TRICK THIS TIME SAID FANNY IN A SATISFIED TONE
CAME WITHIN AN ACE OF IT MUTTERED TOM TO HIMSELF
NOW THEN WHAT IS IT SHE SAID COMING STRAIGHT TO THE POINT
TOM HAD A WEAKNESS FOR PALE PINK ROSES AND PERHAPS POLLY KNEW IT
YOU LL BE AN ORATOR YET
THE HOT PAN HAS MELTED AND SUNK IN THE SNOW PERHAPS SAID FANNY DIGGING INTO THE DRIFT WHERE IT WAS LEFT
POLLY TRIED TO CONQUER THE BAD FEELING
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE HER PUT BOTH ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK AND GIVE HIM A TENDER KISS THAT SAID A GREAT DEAL FOR GRANDMA HAD DIED SINCE POLLY MET HIM LAST AND SHE LONGED TO COMFORT HIM SEEING HOW GRAY AND OLD HE HAD GROWN
BESIDES I COULD N'T SAY A WORD FOR MYSELF IF THAT LETTER WAS FROM SYDNEY CRIED FANNY HUSTLING HER FRIEND TOWARDS THE DOOR IN A GREAT FLUTTER
A GOOD DEAL OF THINKING GOES ON IN THE HEADS OF THESE SHREWD LITTLE FOLKS AND THE ELDERS SHOULD MIND THEIR WAYS FOR THEY GET CRITICISED PRETTY SHARPLY AND IMITATED VERY CLOSELY
IT S YOUR PLACE TO GO AND GET HER
BUT BELLE TRIX AND FANNY WENT TO LUNCH AT A FASHIONABLE ICE-CREAM SALOON NEAR BY AND POLLY MEEKLY FOLLOWED NOT DARING TO HINT AT THE GINGER-BREAD GRANDMA HAD PUT IN HER POCKET FOR LUNCHEON
A GOOD MANY WOMEN HAVE IT NOWADAYS SAID SYDNEY OVER POLLY'S SHOULDER
TRIX NEVER READS ANYTHING
FOR A MINUTE THE FIVE YOUNG WOMEN SAT SILENT LOOKING UP AT THE BEAUTIFUL STRONG FIGURE BEFORE THEM EACH LONGING TO SEE IT DONE AND EACH UNCONSCIOUS THAT SHE WAS HELPING BY HER INDIVIDUAL EFFORT AND EXPERIENCE TO BRING THE DAY WHEN THEIR NOBLEST IDEAL OF WOMANHOOD SHOULD BE EMBODIED IN FLESH AND BLOOD NOT CLAY
I NEVER SAW HIM THERE
ONE AFTER ANOTHER SHE TOOK THE LITTLE GIRLS DOWN THE HILL AND DRAGGED THEM UP AGAIN WHILE THEY REGARDED HER IN THE LIGHT OF A GRAY-COATED ANGEL DESCENDED FOR THEIR EXPRESS BENEFIT
GO AND SAY SOMETHING TO HIM
PRESENTLY SHE FOLDED IT UP AND PUT IT AWAY WITH A SIGH BUT IT NEVER WENT INTO THE RAG-BAG AND MY SENTIMENTAL READERS CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT SAVED IT
ARE YOU READY FOR YOUR VELOCIPEDE HEY POLLY WAS RIGHT
AND BEING LESS GENEROUS TOOK SATISFACTION IN PLAGUING HER
THEN WE WERE STARTLED BY THE NEWS THAT ROBBERS WERE ABOUT
FOR HE HELPED HER WITH A PATERNAL PATIENCE THAT MADE HER EYES TWINKLE WITH SUPPRESSED FUN AS HE SOBERLY EXPLAINED AND ILLUSTRATED UNCONSCIOUSLY IMITATING DOMINIE DEANE TILL POLLY FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP FROM LAUGHING IN HIS FACE
AWFULLY BETTER LIE DOWN THEN CAN'T
I M MUCH OBLIGED
POLLY'S TROUBLES POLLY SOON FOUND THAT SHE WAS IN A NEW WORLD A WORLD WHERE THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS WERE SO DIFFERENT FROM THE SIMPLE WAYS AT HOME THAT SHE FELT LIKE A STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND AND OFTEN WISHED THAT SHE HAD NOT COME
PLEASE DON'T SEND HIM AWAY SIR
I USED TO ROUGH YOU SHAMEFULLY POLLY AND YOU WERE SO GOOD-NATURED YOU LET ME DO IT COULD N'T HELP MYSELF LAUGHED POLLY
BAD NEWS MY DEAR ASKED MISS MILLS WHO HAD JUST HANDED THE NOTE TO POLLY AS SHE CAME IN ONE NOON A FEW WEEKS AFTER JENNY'S ARRIVAL
LET US ALL KISS AND THANK GRANDMA FOR AMUSING US SO NICELY BEFORE WE GO WHISPERED POLLY
NOW IS N'T THAT FINE IT WAS GOOD TO SEE HOW HEARTILY THESE GIRLS SYMPATHIZED IN THEIR COMRADE'S GOOD FORTUNE
YOU DO IT BEAUTIFULLY TOM
TIME FOR WHAT ASKED PAULINA PRY
FAN AND I ARE SICK OF IT AND SO WILL YOU BE IF YOU EAT IT ALL CALLED POLLY WHEN SHE GOT HER BREATH
BUT YOU SEE I VE HAD NO END OF NARROW ESCAPES AND THIS WAS MY LAST CHANCE
OH THUNDER
BUT HE COULD N'T STAND AND STARED ABOUT HIM IN A DAZED SORT OF WAY AS HE SAT ON THE CURBSTONE WHILE POLLY HELD HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HIS FOREHEAD AND PATHETICALLY BEGGED TO KNOW IF HE WAS KILLED
THEN HE SET HIS TEETH CLENCHED HIS HANDS LAY QUITE STILL AND BORE IT LIKE A MAN
AND IT COST OH EVER SO MUCH I DON'T THINK IT IS AS PRETTY AS MAUD'S MINE WAS MADE IN NEW YORK SAID MISS SHAW SMOOTHING HER SKIRTS COMPLACENTLY
MRS SHAW DON'T LIKE IT NOR GRANDMA EITHER I DARE SAY
FOR MANY OF THE PLUMS WERE NOT RIPE SOME WERE HURT BY THE BIRDS SOME CRUSHED IN FALLING AND MANY AS HARD AS STONES
I DO LIKE TO RIDE IN THESE NICE HACKS AND SEE ALL THE FINE THINGS AND HAVE A GOOD TIME DON'T YOU SHE SAID COMPOSING HERSELF THE NEXT MINUTE AS IF IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE WAS GOING A-VISITING
I DOUBT IT BUT TIME CURES WOUNDS OF THAT SORT AMAZING QUICK WISH IT DID WHO IS SIR PHILIP DEMANDED MAUD PRICKING UP HER EARS
NEVER MIND IT POLLY I M NERVOUS AND TIRED
YOU LL HAVE TO COME TOO FAN HE ADDED PAUSING ON HIS WAY TO THE DOOR ARRESTED BY THE AWFUL IDEA THAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO ADDRESS SEVERAL STRANGE GIRLS BEFORE HE GOT THE RIGHT ONE
PERHAPS YOU WOULD IF YOU TRIED IT AND POLLY LAUGHED AS SHE GLANCED AT TOM
IF I WAS N'T SO BUSY I D LIKE TO DEVOTE MYSELF TO HER SHE HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR ME SAID POLLY GRATEFULLY
IF FATHER DOES HIS BEST TO GIVE US THE CHANCE WE EACH WANT THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS TO WORK WITH A WILL WHATEVER YOU DO YOU CAN'T HELP WORKING WITH A WILL CRIED TOM WHO HAD BEEN SO INTERESTED THAT HE FORGOT HE WAS PLAYING EAVESDROPPER
POLLY DISCREETLY FELL BEHIND AND AMUSED HERSELF LOOKING INTO SHOP-WINDOWS TILL FANNY MINDFUL OF HER MANNERS EVEN AT SUCH AN INTERESTING TIME TOOK HER INTO A PICTURE GALLERY AND BADE HER ENJOY THE WORKS OF ART WHILE THEY RESTED
NO ONLY TEN BUT THAT WAS PRETTY WELL FOR A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD DRESSMAKER
I DID N'T THINK YOU D GET THE IDEA SO WELL BUT YOU HAVE AND I M PROUD OF YOUR INSIGHT
BELLE SAW IT AND RUSHED TO THE RESCUE WITH MORE GOOD-WILL THAN WISDOM
WILL YOU FORGIVE THAT TOO HE ASKED IN A WHISPER STROKING THE RED WRIST
I SEE HER MAKE FUN OF ME AND I CAN'T FEEL AS I DID
WHAT DO YOU THINK TRIX WILL SAY TO THIS WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY THE WAY YOU VE BEEN GOING ON TO-NIGHT DON'T KNOW AND DON'T CARE
SHE WAS POOR TILL SHE WAS NEARLY FIFTY
THEY BOTH HAD NECKLACES AND BRACELETS EAR-RINGS AND BROOCHES
DOWN IN THE STREET THERE WAS A CROWD OF COURSE AND WHEN HE LEFT THEY WANTED TO TAKE OUT THE HORSES AND DRAG HIM HOME IN TRIUMPH
TRIX
CAN'T YOU LEND A HAND ANYWHERE
FOR OF LATE POLLY HAD TALKED MUCH WITH THE GOOD LADY AND LEARNED QUICKLY THE LESSONS HER UNSELFISH LIFE CONVEYED
HE IS THE STUDIOUS ONE AND POLLY IS VERY PROUD OF HIM
NOW A SHINY BLACK BEAVER IS NOT AN OBJECT EXACTLY CALCULATED TO INSPIRE TENDER OR ROMANTIC SENTIMENTS ONE WOULD FANCY BUT THAT PARTICULAR STOVE PIPE SEEMED TO TOUCH POLLY TO THE HEART FOR SHE CAUGHT IT UP AS IF ITS FALL SUGGESTED A GREATER ONE SMOOTHED OUT A SLIGHT DINT AS IF IT WAS SYMBOLICAL OF THE HARD KNOCKS ITS OWNER'S HEAD WAS NOW IN DANGER OF RECEIVING AND STOOD LOOKING AT IT WITH AS MUCH PITY AND RESPECT AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE CROWN OF A DISINHERITED PRINCE
THE MOMENT HIS LIGHT VANISHED FANNY BOLTED THE DOOR SAYING SPITEFULLY NOW WE ARE SAFE FROM ANY MORE TRICKS
IN AN EVIL HOUR POLLY HAD LET HER PLAY BOAT IN HER BIG TRUNK WHICH STOOD EMPTY
AS IT WAS HER HEART WAS VERY FULL AND THE TEARS ROSE TO HER EYES MORE THAN ONCE EVERYONE WAS SO KIND AND SO SORRY TO HAVE HER GO
POOR LAD HE WAS LOST AT SEA YOU KNOW
BUT THE THING THAT MADE WILL LAUGH MOST WAS THAT THE VERY FELLOW WHO DID IT GOT HIS TROUSERS BURNT TRYING TO PUT OUT THE FIRE AND HE ASKED THE IS IT FACULTY OR PRESIDENT EITHER WILL DO MURMURED TOM WHO WAS SHAKING WITH SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER
SO OF COURSE SHE KNOWS WHAT IS WHAT I DON'T CARE IF SHE HAS
I DON'T CARE FOR THE DRESS BUT I D LIKE TO SLIP A LITTLE MONEY INTO HER POCKET FOR I KNOW SHE NEEDS IT AND IS TOO GOOD TO ASK DEAR MR SHAW FOR ANYTHING SHE CAN GET ON WITHOUT DID SHE SAY THAT
YOU ARE FOURTEEN
DO TELL US ALL ABOUT IT AND THAT WILL BE THE BEST OF THE WHOLE CRIED POLLY WHO LOVED HISTORY AND KNEW A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THE GALLANT FRENCHMAN AND HIS BRAVE LIFE
I M DYING FOR ANOTHER AND POLLY JUMPED UP WITH BOTH HANDS OUT AND SUCH A GRATEFUL FACE THAT MR SYDNEY RESOLVED SHE SHOULD HAVE AS MANY TURNS AS SHE LIKED
KINDNESS ALWAYS DOES TOM STOPPED SHORT THERE AND STOOD A MINUTE TURNING THE LETTER ABOUT IN HIS HAND AS IF IT CONTAINED A SWEET WHICH NEUTRALIZED THE BITTER IN THAT SMALLER NOTE AND TOUCHED HIM VERY MUCH
THEN OUT CAME THE TRUTH ALL IN A BREATH JUST AS HE USED TO BOLT OUT HIS BOYISH MISDEMEANORS AND THEN BACK UP AGAINST THE WALL READY TO TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES
OH AND MAUD SEEMED SATISFIED BUT THE SHARP CHILD HAD HER SUSPICIONS NEVERTHELESS
THEN THE WOUNDED HERO SUPPORTED BY THE HELPFUL POLLY
AUNT WAS AN OLD LADY BUT SHE MADE A GRAND TOILET AND WAS AS ANXIOUS TO LOOK WELL AS ANY GIRL WHAT DID SHE WEAR ASKED FAN WITH INTEREST
CAN'T I GO
I SHOULD N'T HAVE DONE IT IF I HAD N'T KNOWN MY MOTHER WAS WILLING
HE DID N'T RECIPROCATE BUT WENT OFF TO INDIA TO SPOIL HIS CONSTITUTION SO CLARA MARRIED A MAN TWENTY YEARS OLDER THAN SHE IS AND CONSOLES HERSELF BY BEING THE BEST-DRESSED WOMAN IN THE CITY THAT ACCOUNTS FOR IT SAID POLLY WHEN TOM'S LONG WHISPER ENDED
YES I WILL
BUT WHEN HE SPOKE HE LOOKED STRAIGHT UP IN HIS FATHER'S FACE WHILE HIS OWN SHONE WITH PLEASURE AS HE ANSWERED IN ONE BREATH THANKEE SIR
PITY IT WON'T LAST A WEEK SAID TRIX
AH THAT NOW HAS A STORY WORTH TELLING CRIED GRANDMA
NELLY LOOKED UP AND STARED AND LAUGHED AND CLAPPED HER HANDS WHEN SHE SAW WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO
GRANDMA LOVED TO TELL THIS STORY AND ALWAYS ASSUMED HER MOST IMPOSING AIR TO DO HONOR TO HER THEME
IT SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD EFFECT UPON HIS CONSTITUTION FIRST-RATE
YOU ARE THE MOST FAITHFUL LOVERESS AS MAUD SAYS THAT WAS EVER KNOWN DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF THAT I VE WORN IT ALL THESE YEARS SIR
I SAY IF YOU PLEASE IS YOUR NAME POLLY MILTON MEEKLY ASKED TOM PAUSING BEFORE THE BREEZY STRANGER
AND YOU HAVE JUST THE RIGHT WAY OF COMFORTING PEOPLE WITHOUT MAKING A FUSS HAVE I SAID POLLY LOOKING MUCH GRATIFIED BY THE WORDS
IF SYD CAN GET HER LET HIM AND I WON'T SAY A WORD
INDEED SOME OF THEM RATHER SHOCKED AND PUZZLED HER
WITH SUDDEN ENERGY THE OLD LADY PLUCKED OFF THE COVER AND THERE LAY SALLY WITH HER HAIR DRESSED LA TOPSY HER ABSURD BREAST-PIN AND HER DUSTY BOOTS AMONG PAPERS OF CANDY BITS OF PIE AND CAKE ORANGES AND APPLES AND A CANDLE UPSIDE DOWN BURNING A HOLE IN THE SHEET
SO KIND TO SAY THAT ABOUT TOM
SO STUDIOUS AND CLEVER THE PEOPLE CALLED HIM A FINE FELLOW
SEE IF SHE DON'T AND TO MAUD'S GREAT SURPRISE TOM DID N'T LAUGH AT HER PROJECT
IT S SO FUNNY TO SEE HER AND NICK PERCHES ON THE RACK AND SINGS AS IF HE D KILL HIMSELF VERY THRILLING SAID TOM IN A SLEEPY TONE
THERE WAS A DREADFUL LITTLE PAUSE WHICH POLLY BROKE BY SAYING ABRUPTLY
FORTUNATELY SUCH CASES ARE VERY RARE SAID ANOTHER YOUNG LADY WHO SELDOM READ THE NEWSPAPERS
FANNY UNDERSTOOD IT THEN AND THREW HERSELF INTO POLLY'S ARMS CRYING WITH A SHOWER OF GRATEFUL TEARS
SO SHE USED TO SLIP OUT ALONE SOMETIMES WHEN FANNY WAS ABSORBED IN NOVELS COMPANY OR MILLINERY AND GET FINE BRISK WALKS ROUND THE PARK ON THE UNFASHIONABLE SIDE WHERE THE BABIES TOOK THEIR AIRINGS
THIS IS IN YOUR LINE SO DO COME AND HELP ME THROUGH
COME IN SAID A VOICE AND OBEYING FANNY FOUND HERSELF IN A LARGE QUEERLY FURNISHED ROOM LIGHTED FROM ABOVE AND OCCUPIED BY TWO GIRLS
BUT SHE DID NOT SUCCEED FOR AS SHE STOOD WARMING HER RUBBERS AT THE DINING-ROOM FIRE WONDERING PENSIVELY AS SHE DID SO IF MARIA BAILEY HAD SMALL FEET AND IF TOM EVER PUT HER RUBBERS ON FOR HER THE LITTLE OVERSHOES WERE TAKEN OUT OF HER HANDS AND TOM'S VOICE SAID REPROACHFULLY DID YOU REALLY MEAN TO RUN AWAY AND NOT LET ME GO HOME WITH YOU I M NOT AFRAID
AND THEN YOU CAN GET YOUR BOOTS WELL
BUT I DO THINK SHE FELT IT VERY MUCH FOR SHE WOULD N'T GO OUT AT ALL AND GOT THIN AND PALE AND BLUE AND WAS REALLY QUITE TOUCHING
BUT CEREMONY OPPRESSED HIS SPIRITS AND HE WAS FORCED TO STRUGGLE MANFULLY WITH THE WILD DESIRE TO PROPOSE A GAME OF LEAP-FROG FOR THE LONG DRAWING-ROOMS CLEARED FOR DANCING TEMPTED HIM SORELY
YES IT S GOOD PRACTICE LAUGHED POLLY FILLING HER TINY TEAPOT AND TAKING HER PLACE BEHIND THE TRAY WITH A MATRONLY AIR WHICH WAS THE BEST JOKE OF THE WHOLE
THERE ARE TWO
I GAVE IT UP BUT KIT WENT TO WORK AND MATCHED EVERY SCRAP THAT WAS LEFT SO NEATLY THAT SHE GOT OUT THE HALF SLEEVE PUT IT ON THE UNDER SIDE AND NO ONE WAS THE WISER
AS THEY ATE THE OTHERS TALKED AND SHE LISTENED FINDING IT AS INTERESTING AS ANY ROMANCE TO HEAR THESE YOUNG WOMEN DISCUSS THEIR PLANS AMBITIONS SUCCESSES AND DEFEATS
NOW I MUST GIVE IT UP AND NOW I SEE HOW MUCH I HOPED AND WHAT A DREADFUL LOSS IT S GOING TO BE TWO GREAT TEARS ROLLED DOWN POLLY'S CHEEKS AND FANNY WIPED THEM AWAY FEELING AN INTENSE DESIRE TO GO WEST BY THE NEXT TRAIN WITHER MARIA BAILEY WITH A SINGLE LOOK AND BRING TOM BACK AS A GIFT TO POLLY
BUT I WISH SOME ONE WOULD INVENT A NEW AMUSEMENT FOR RICH PEOPLE
WE ARE OUT ON A RAMPAGE
LET US GO AND TAKE A GOOD WALK AND DON'T YOU TELL ANY ONE HOW I CAME AND CRIED LIKE A BABY NEVER SAID POLLY PUTTING ON HER BONNET
GOOD FOR YOU POLLY PEACEMAKER CRIED TOM QUOTING HIS FATHER AND GIVING THEM A GRAND PUSH AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY OF EXPRESSING HIS APPROBATION OF THE SENTIMENT
OF COURSE I DO
GRANDMA CHAPTER 7
NOW TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU SAID POLLY WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE
DON'T DO THAT AGAIN CHICKEN OR YOU LL BLOW ME AWAY
BUT YOU BROUGHT SOMETHING INTO MY HOUSE THAT MAKES IT WARMER AND PLEASANTER AND WON'T QUITE VANISH I HOPE WHEN YOU GO AWAY MY CHILD POLLY HAD NEVER HEARD MR SHAW SPEAK LIKE THAT BEFORE AND DID N'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY SHE FELT SO PROUD AND HAPPY AT THIS PROOF OF THE TRUTH OF HER MOTHER'S WORDS WHEN SHE SAID THAT EVEN A LITTLE GIRL COULD EXERT AN INFLUENCE AND DO SOME GOOD IN THIS BIG BUSY WORLD SHE ONLY GAVE HER FRIEND A GRATEFUL LOOK SWEETER THAN ANY WORDS AND THEY WENT ON TOGETHER HAND IN HAND THROUGH THE SOFT-FALLING SNOW IF POLLY COULD HAVE SEEN WHAT WENT INTO THAT TOP TRAY SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY OVERCOME
YES STRONG-MINDED STRONG-HEARTED STRONG-SOULED AND STRONG-BODIED
GOT SOME NEW FRIENDS I BELIEVE OLD LADIES SEWING-GIRLS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT
NOW RUN DOWN FOR THE BELL HAS RUNG
A MONTH OR TWO MAYBE
DID YOU KNOW THAT BAD BOY ASKED INNOCENT MAUD
THE OTHER GIRLS WENT TO THEIR ROOMS AS AGREED UPON AND ALL WAS SOON DARK AND STILL UP STAIRS WHILE MISS COTTON BEGAN TO ENJOY HERSELF BELOW AS SHE ALWAYS DID WHEN HER YOUNG CHARGES WERE SAFELY DISPOSED OF
JUST GO AND SHOW HIM THAT YOU DON'T DOUBT OR BLAME HIM FOR THIS BUT LOVE HIM ALL THE MORE AND ARE READY AND GLAD TO HELP HIM BEAR THE TROUBLE I M GOING I AIN'T AFRAID
IF THE HISTORY OF POLLY'S GIRLISH EXPERIENCES SUGGESTS A HINT OR INSINUATES A LESSON I SHALL FEEL THAT IN SPITE OF MANY OBSTACLES I HAVE NOT ENTIRELY NEGLECTED MY DUTY TOWARD THE LITTLE MEN AND WOMEN FOR WHOM IT IS AN HONOR AND A PLEASURE TO WRITE SINCE IN THEM I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND MY KINDEST PATRONS GENTLEST CRITICS WARMEST FRIENDS
I NEVER DO
DEBBY WAS VERY GOOD TO ME FOR SHE NEVER STOPPED TO SCOLD BUT LAID ME DOWN ON THE OLD SOFA AND BOUND UP MY POOR LITTLE FEET WITH OIL AND COTTON WOOL
I DON'T KNOW ANOTHER MAN LIVING EXCEPT FATHER WHO WOULD HAVE DONE SUCH A THING OR WHO I COULD BRING MYSELF TO TAKE IT FROM
THE SECOND WAS JUST A HANDFUL OF SWEET-PEAS AND MIGNONETTE WITH A FEW CHEERFUL PANSIES AND ONE FRAGRANT LITTLE ROSE IN THE MIDDLE
IT S NOT NEARLY SO PLEASANT OR SO SHORT FOR YOU AS THE PARK I KNOW IT BUT PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET TIRED OF OLD WAYS AND LIKE TO TRY NEW ONES POLLY DID N'T SAY THAT QUITE NATURALLY AND SYDNEY GAVE HER A QUICK LOOK AS HE ASKED
IT WON'T HURT YOU MUCH I GUESS
COME NOW WHAT IS IT I SHAN'T TELL YOU
SHE WAS WELL ENOUGH TO BE MOVED TO-NIGHT SO I BROUGHT HER HOME AND LAID HER SAFELY IN MY BED
BELLE AND TRIX WERE THERE IN FULL DRESS
OH WON'T YOU GET IT WHEN WE GO HOME CRIED THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN EVEN BEFORE HE CHANGED HIS GRACEFUL ATTITUDE
AND BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO THANK MR SYDNEY AS WARMLY AS SHE WISHED TOM CAME UP TO SAY WITH HIS MOST LORDLY AIR YOU DANCE SPLENDIDLY POLLY
IT IS VERY PLEASANT TO BE LOVED AND ADMIRED VERY SWEET TO THINK WE SHALL BE MISSED AND MOURNED WHEN WE DIE
AND WHEN SHE HEARD THAT PIECE OF NEWS POLLY COULD N'T UNLOVE HIM ALL AT ONCE THOUGH SHE TRIED VERY HARD AS WAS HER DUTY
HE CAME AND SAT HIMSELF CROSS-LEGGED ON THE FLOOR BEFORE THE LOWER DRAWER OF THE CABINET WHICH GRANDMA OPENED FOR HIM SAYING WITH A BENIGN STROKE OF THE CURLY HEAD THERE DEAR THAT S WHERE I KEEP THE LITTLE MEMORIALS OF MY BROTHER JACK
AS SOON AS HE HAD DONE IT HE REMEMBERED THAT FANNY CONSIDERED THEM VULGAR AND FELT THAT HE HAD DISGRACED HIS FAMILY
POLLY ROSE AT ONCE AND REMAINED STANDING TILL THE OLD LADY PASSED ON
THE WALK WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS TRIALS HOWEVER
THAT SHE WAS SUCH A BRIGHT AND LOVABLE GIRL IT WAS A PITY SHE SHOULD NOT ALWAYS BE GAY AND PRETTY AND ENJOY HERSELF
A QUEER LITTLE THRILL WENT OVER ME BUT I RESOLVED TO KEEP QUIET TILL I WAS SURE SOMETHING WAS WRONG FOR I HAD GIVEN SO MANY FALSE ALARMS I DID N'T WANT JACK TO LAUGH AT ME AGAIN
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING
SHE IS ONE OF THE TIMID INNOCENT HUMBLE CREATURES WHO CAN'T PUSH THEIR WAY AND SO GET PUT ASIDE AND FORGOTTEN
FANNY CHATTED LIKE A MAGPIE AND MAUD FIDGETED TILL TOM PROPOSED TO PUT HER UNDER THE BIG DISH-COVER WHICH PRODUCED SUCH AN EXPLOSION THAT THE YOUNG LADY WAS BORNE SCREAMING AWAY BY THE MUCH-ENDURING KATY
POLLY WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT FAN WAS CRYING
TO POOR COUNTRY FOLKS WHO HAVE N'T ANY CLOTHES RICH FOLKS TO RELIEVE THEM SEND OLD LACE GOWNS AND SATIN BOWS I THINK THAT WILL IS GOING TO BE AS NICE A POET AS MR SHAKESPEARE REMARKED MAUD IN A TONE OF SERIOUS CONVICTION
WHILE THE GIRL PRANCED ON HER OWN DOORSTEP AS IF PRACTISING FOR THE JOYFUL DANCE WHICH SHE HAD PROMISED NOT TO FORGET
I VE GOT EVER SO MANY FAULTS AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THEM ALL AND HELP ME CURE THEM AS YOU HAVE YOUR OWN
TOM HAD RATHER PATRONIZED WILL WHO DID N'T LIKE IT AND SHOWED THAT HE DID N'T BY REFUSING TO BORROW MONEY OF HIM OR ACCEPT ANY OF HIS INVITATIONS TO JOIN THE CLUBS AND SOCIETIES TO WHICH TOM BELONGED
FOR FANNY HAD TOLD GRANDMA ABOUT THE POOR LITTLE PRESENTS SHE HAD ONCE LAUGHED AT AND THEY HAD ALL LAID THEIR HEADS TOGETHER TO PROVIDE SOMETHING REALLY FINE AND APPROPRIATE FOR EVERY MEMBER OF THE MILTON FAMILY
PREPARE YOURSELF SOMEBODY IS ENGAGED SHE SAID IN A SOLEMN TONE THAT MADE POLLY PUT UP HER HAND AS IF TO WARD OFF AN EXPECTED BLOW
FOR TO TELL THE TRUTH POLLY HAD A SPICE OF GIRLISH MALICE AND RATHER LIKED TO SEE DOMINEERING TOM EAT HUMBLE-PIE JUST ENOUGH TO DO HIM GOOD YOU KNOW
MR SYDNEY SMILED AND TAKING A NOTE FROM HIS POCKET PRESENTED IT SAYING WITH A REPROACHFUL LOOK BEHOLD THE PROOF OF MY TRUTH AND NEVER DOUBT AGAIN POLLY BEGGED PARDON READ THE NOTE FROM THE LITTLE GIRL'S MOTHER WHICH WAS TO HAVE BEEN LEFT AT HER ROOM IF SHE WAS ABSENT AND GAVE THE BEARER A VERY GRATEFUL LOOK AS SHE ACCEPTED THIS WELCOME ADDITION TO HER PUPILS
FOR THIS IS A RIGHT NO ONE CAN DENY US
THE SIGNAL
HERE ARE THREE DRAWERS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN OPENED YET
MAUD WAS TWELVE NOW
SO YOU ARE
HE S SO DIFFERENT AND VERY YOUNG AND HAS LOTS OF FAULTS I KNOW BUT I LIKE HIM ALL THE BETTER FOR IT AND HE S HONEST AND BRAVE AND HAS GOT A BIG WARM HEART AND I D RATHER HAVE HIM CARE FOR ME THAN THE WISEST BEST MOST ACCOMPLISHED MAN IN THE WORLD SIMPLY BECAUSE I LOVE HIM IF TOM COULD ONLY HAVE SEEN POLLY'S FACE WHEN SHE SAID THAT
MAUD STOOD AT THE WINDOW WATCHING THE FALLING FLAKES WITH AN ANXIOUS COUNTENANCE AND PRESENTLY A GREAT SIGH BROKE FROM HER
I DID UP HIS FRILLS TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
ONLY THEY HAVE QUARRELLED AND HE WANTS TO MAKE HER MAD BY FLIRTING A LITTLE WITH ME
I VE THOUGHT SERIOUSLY OF GOING TO CALIFORNIA AUSTRALIA OR SOME OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACE WHERE MEN GET RICH IN A HURRY OH NO CRIED POLLY PUTTING OUT HER HAND AS IT TO KEEP HIM AND THEN SNATCHING IT BACK AGAIN BEFORE HE COULD TURN ROUND
I M GLAD I HAD A HAND IN IT BUT POLLY DESERVES THE CREDIT AND MUST WEAR THE POSY AND TURNING TO HER HE PUT THE ROSE INTO HER HAIR WITH MORE GALLANTRY THAN TASTE FOR A THORN PRICKED HER HEAD THE LEAVES TICKLED HER EAR AND THE FLOWER WAS UPSIDE DOWN
SHE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO SAY WHICH OF THE TWO LIVES WAS THE RIGHT ONE
I LL NEVER LET YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MY FUN AGAIN CRIED FAN IN A PASSION TRYING TO CATCH AND SHAKE HIM WHILE HE DODGED AND CHUCKLED IN HIGH GLEE
I M AFRAID I CAN'T GO TO POLLY'S ANSWERED MAUD DISCONSOLATELY
POLLY'S FLIRTING WAS SUCH A VERY MILD IMITATION OF THE FASHIONABLE THING THAT TRIX CO
I DON'T KNOW WHEN I BEGAN TO LOVE TOM BUT I FOUND OUT THAT I DID LAST WINTER AND WAS AS MUCH SURPRISED AS YOU ARE CONTINUED POLLY AS IF GLAD TO UNBURDEN HER HEART
FOR THE OLD MAN WENT TO HIS OFFICE EVERY DAY WITH THE REGULARITY OF A MACHINE THAT WOULD GO ITS USUAL ROUND UNTIL IT STOPPED WHILE THE YOUNG MAN STAYED AT HOME WITH THE WOMEN AND LET HIS MOTHER COMFORT HIM
POLLY IS N'T GOING TO MARRY ANYBODY
THERE WE ARE
YOU SHALL HAVE MY WHITE CLOAK AND ANY OTHER LITTLE RIGGING YOU WANT
TOM IS SUCH A BEAR RETORTED FANNY
HAVE YOU BEEN SICK AND NEVER TOLD ME NO I M ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
DREADFUL STATE OF MIND IS N'T IT SUPPOSE YOU COME AND SEE SOME OF MY FRIENDS INSTEAD
BUT WHEN ANYTHING WAS THE MATTER HE ALWAYS WENT TO THE OLD LADY AND WAS VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE FUSSING POLLY LIKED HIM FOR THIS AND OFTEN WANTED TO SPEAK OF IT
A VERY OLD STORY MY DEAR NEW AND DREADFUL AS IT SEEMS TO YOU AND I THINK IT WON'T DO YOU ANY HARM TO SEE AND HELP THIS LITTLE GIRL WHO HAS GONE THROUGH DARK PLACES THAT YOU ARE NEVER LIKE TO KNOW I WILL
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU ASKED REBECCA TURNING TO HER WITH A SUDDEN SHINE IN HER KEEN EYES
DONE CRIED TOM PRESENTLY
MAUD GAVE AN INCREDULOUS SNIFF AND WONDERED WHY BIG GIRLS NEED TO BE SO DREADFUL MYSTERIOUS ABOUT THEIR OLD SECRETS THIS SILK REMINDS ME OF KITTY'S PERFORMANCE LAST SUMMER
AND THE GOSSIPS WHO SAID SOFTLY TO ONE ANOTHER OVER THEIR MUFFINS AND TEA
THE HOUSE WAS OLD WITH CONVENIENT LITTLE BACK WINDOWS AND FIVE OUTSIDE DOORS
BUT IT S SO COMFORTABLE WHEN IT S OVER LET S WAS TOM'S BRIEF ADVICE
BUT WHILE SHE BEGAN TO KNIT A PRETTY PAIR OF WHITE BED-SOCKS TO BE TIED WITH ROSE-COLORED RIBBONS FOR HER MOTHER SHE THOUGHT SOME VERY SOBER THOUGHTS UPON THE SUBJECT OF TEMPTATION
REAL FRIENDS WHOM NOTHING WILL PART LET A LOVER COME BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP WON'T LAST LONG SAID FANNY
FOR THOUGH I DISCREETLY REFRAIN FROM ANY PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION STILL JUDGING FROM THE PRESENT FASHIONS I THINK ONE MAY VENTURE TO PREDICT THAT SIX YEARS HENCE THEY WOULD BE SOMETHING FRIGHTFUL
FAN LAUGHED A GOOD DEAL BUT I GUESS POLLY IS THE LOVERESS REPLIED MAUD AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
WELL AS I WAS SAYING THE GOVERNOR WANTED TO GIVE A BREAKFAST TO THE FRENCH OFFICERS AND MADAM WHO WAS A HOSPITABLE SOUL GOT UP A SPLENDID ONE FOR THEM
I SHOULD LOVE TO GO TO LONDON AND HAVE A GOOD TIME BUT I DON'T THINK I SHOULD CARE ABOUT SPENDING EVER SO MUCH MONEY OR GOING TO COURT
I SAW SOME LITTLE WHITE THINGS ON THE DINING-ROOM FLOOR AS I RACED THROUGH
HOW GOOD YOU ARE
THEY EVEN LAUGHED OCCASIONALLY FOR THE GIRLS IN THEIR IGNORANCE ASKED QUEER QUESTIONS
SHE HAS LOOKED SO DOWN-HEARTED AND PALE FOR A WEEK THAT I THOUGHT SHE WAS SICK AND ASKED HER ABOUT IT SAID MRS FINN BUT SHE THANKED ME IN HER BASHFUL WAY AND SAID SHE WAS PRETTY WELL SO I LET HER ALONE
BUT TOM TURNED A COLD SHOULDER TO POLLY AND MADE IT EVIDENT BY HIS CAVALIER MANNER THAT HE REALLY DID N'T THINK HER WORTH A SIXPENCE ANOTHER THING THAT TROUBLED POLLY WAS HER CLOTHES FOR THOUGH NO ONE SAID ANYTHING SHE KNEW THEY WERE VERY PLAIN
GO AND REST NOW
DEAR ME WHICH OF OUR SWEETHEARTS SENDS US DAINTY BOUQUETS OF VIOLETS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING ASKED FANNY SUDDENLY SPYING THE PURPLE CLUSTER IN A GRACEFUL LITTLE VASE ON THE PIANO
I NEVER RODE IN A WHEELBARROW I NEVER SAT ON CABBAGES AND I DON'T THINK IT S FAIR SHE SAID WITH AN INJURED EXPRESSION
ADIEU MA CHERE I MUST DRESS FOR CHURCH
I CAN LEND YOU SOME I VE GOT TEN DOLLARS TO DO WHAT I LIKE WITH
IF SHE STARTS RIGHT PUTS HER TERMS HIGH ENOUGH AND GETS A FEW GOOD NAMES TO GIVE HER THE ENTRE INTO OUR FIRST FAMILIES I DON'T DOUBT SHE WILL DO NICELY FOR I MUST SAY POLLY HAS THE MANNERS OF A LADY OBSERVED MRS SHAW
THEN THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO LOVER NUMBER TWO AND AFTER A LONG CONFABULATION POLLY GAVE IT AS HER FIRM BELIEF THAT A
FOR THE MOST UTTERLY FASHIONABLE LIFE DOES NOT KILL THE HEART OUT OF WOMEN TILL YEARS OF SELFISH PLEASURE HAVE PASSED OVER THEIR HEADS
WE CAN MAKE SOME MORE CRIED POLLY TRYING TO PART THEM AND LOOKING SO DISTRESSED THAT THEY STOPPED ASHAMED AND IN A MINUTE SORRY THAT SHE SHOULD SEE SUCH A DISPLAY OF TEMPER
I SAY POLLY COME AND HAVE SOME FUN I D RATHER READ THAT IS N'T POLITE POLLY LAUGHED AND TURNED A PAGE
SO THAT SHOWS YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT WELL THEY OUGHT TO IF THEY DON'T
FOR THE LOVELY PHANTOMS SANG NEGRO MELODIES TALKED SLANG AND WERE A DISGRACE TO THE GOOD OLD-FASHIONED ELVES WHOM SHE KNEW AND LOVED SO WELL
SOUNDS OF STRIFE IN THE LIBRARY LED HER TO ENTER
BUT SHE CAN'T AFFORD EXPENSIVE LUXURIES AND SHE DON'T APPROVE OF FLIRTING SO YOU WILL HAVE TO LET HER GO HER OWN WAY AND REFRESH HERSELF WITH SUCH GLIMPSES OF YOU AS HER ENGAGEMENTS PERMIT ANSWERED FANNY IN THE SARCASTIC TONE WHICH WAS BECOMING HABITUAL TO HER
TOMMY S QUENCHED
SHE NO LONGER FELT AN INJURED HARD-WORKING UNHAPPY POLLY BUT AS IF QUITE BURDENED WITH BLESSINGS FOR WHICH SHE WAS N'T HALF GRATEFUL ENOUGH
AND YOU COME ON MINE
BOYS DO AS THEY LIKE
HE MIGHT MAKE THEM SO PROUD AND HAPPY
BEFORE SHE GOT HALF-WAY UP STAIRS SHE SAW TOM COMING AFTER AND IMMEDIATELY SAT DOWN TO GUARD HER FEET
HER FATHER WAS BUSY HER MOTHER NERVOUS AND SICK FANNY ABSORBED IN HER OWN AFFAIRS AND TOM REGARDED HER AS MOST YOUNG MEN DO THEIR YOUNGER SISTERS AS A PERSON BORN FOR HIS AMUSEMENT AND CONVENIENCE NOTHING MORE
I LIKE IT VERY MUCH SHE SAID IN SUCH A HEARTY TONE THAT TOM COULD NOT DOUBT THE GENUINENESS OF HER PLEASURE
YOU ARE A DEAR AND EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN YOU WERE LAST SUMMER ONLY YOU VE BEEN BROUGHT UP DIFFERENTLY FROM US
YOURS EVER FAN
POLLY WAS JUST GOING TO SHRINK AWAY SAYING OH I CAN'T WHEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT TOM ONCE CALLED HER A COWARD
PRAY TAKE CARE OF THE POULTRY DURING MY ABSENCE
IT WAS A SUMMER EVENING SO THAT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IT WAS STILL LIGHT
HOW LONG IS SHE GOING TO STAY DEMANDED TOM MAKING HIS TOILET BY A PROMISCUOUS SHAKE
HERE S A NICE PLACE FOR YOU BETWEEN BELLE AND MISS PERKINS AND HERE S A SWEET LITTLE DRESS TO MAKE UNLESS YOU LIKE SOMETHING ELSE BETTER SAID FANNY RECEIVING HER FRIEND WITH WARMTH AND PLACING HER WHERE SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD ENJOY HERSELF
SO YOU WON'T CATCH ME THAT WAY TOM I SAY HOW CAME YOU TO KNOW SUCH A LOT ASKED TOM MUCH IMPRESSED
I DON'T SEEM TO CARE FOR ANYTHING ELSE SAID TOM FEELING NO APPETITE BUT BOUND TO DO JUSTICE TO THAT CAKE IF HE FELL A VICTIM TO HIS GRATITUDE
I HOPE YOU WILL SOON HAVE TWO GOOD STRONG ONES BESIDE YOUR OWN MY DEAR ANSWERED POLLY AS SHE VANISHED WITH A PARTING TWINKLE THAT KEPT FAN'S FACE BRIGHT ALL DAY
NEVER MIND WHAT YOU SAY
I M GLAD I DON'T DISGRACE MY NAME SAID SYDNEY LOOKING DOWN INTO THE MERRY BLUE EYES THAT THANKED HIM SILENTLY FOR MANY OF THE SMALL KINDNESSES THAT WOMEN NEVER CAN FORGET
OH SHE SHOOK HIM WHAT A SPECTACLE AND TOM LOOKED AS IF HE WOULD HAVE ENJOYED SEEING IT BUT FANNY'S FACE GREW SO FORBIDDING THAT TOM'S LITTLE DOG WHO WAS APPROACHING TO WELCOME HER PUT HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS AND FLED UNDER THE TABLE
ANSWER ME ONE QUESTION FIRST SAID FANNY LOOKING AS IF A SUDDEN FEAR HAD COME OVER HER
I D NO IDEA HE WAS SO DEVOTED SAID FANNY STOOPING TO SMELL THE FLOWERS AND AT THE SAME TIME READ A CARD THAT LAY NEAR THEM
NEVER MIND WHAT HAPPENED FOR A LITTLE BIT
GOOD NIGHT DEAR AND WITH ANOTHER KISS POLLY WENT AWAY TO SIT IN THE DARKNESS OF HER OWN ROOM PLAYING HER SOFTEST AIRS TILL THE TIRED EYES BELOW WERE SHUT AND LITTLE JANE SEEMED TO FLOAT AWAY ON A SEA OF PLEASANT SOUNDS INTO THE HAPPIER LIFE WHICH HAD JUST DAWNED FOR HER
AND AFTER DOING THE HONORS OF THE HOUSE FAN WAS CALLED TO THE DRESSMAKER LEAVING POLLY TO AMUSE HERSELF IN THE GREAT DRAWING-ROOM
SUCH A FUSS AS SHE MADE
YOU LL DANCE LIKE A FAIRY WHISPERED FAN
AT A STREET CORNER A BLACK-EYED SCHOOL-BOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY-FACED SCHOOL-GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
BUT SHE WAS SPARED ANY STRUGGLE FOR WHEN SHE REACHED THE PLACE THE TICKET OFFICE WAS BLOCKED UP BY EAGER PURCHASERS AND THE DISAPPOINTED FACES THAT TURNED AWAY TOLD POLLY THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR HER
COME WITH ME POLLY AND TELL ME WHAT TO DO SAID FANNY DRAWING HER FRIEND AFTER HER
EVERYONE WAS ABSORBED
BELLE HAS GOT A VIRTUOUS FIT
I LL DO IT SIR
I DO BELIEVE SHE WILL IF SHE CAN FIND A FARMER ANYWHERE SAID FANNY
PUTTING HER GUEST INTO THE BEST CHAIR POLLY SAT DOWN AND BEAMED AT HIM WITH SUCH HOSPITABLE SATISFACTION THAT TOM WENT UP SEVERAL PEGS IN HIS OWN ESTIMATION
SATURDAY MORNING WAS POLLY'S CLEARING-UP DAY AND FAN FOUND HER WITH A HANDKERCHIEF TIED OVER HER HEAD AND A BIG APRON ON JUST PUTTING THE LAST TOUCHES TO THE TIDY LITTLE ROOM WHICH WAS AS FRESH AND BRIGHT AS WATER AIR AND A PAIR OF HANDS COULD MAKE IT
BUT SHE COULD N'T HELP SOFTENING TO TOM WHO DID SEEM IN A PREDICAMENT BETWEEN TWO WEEPING DAMSELS
BUT I DON'T THINK IT S DOING AS WE D BE DONE BY AND IT SEEMS A GREAT DEAL MORE HONEST TO SHOW A MAN THAT YOU DON'T LOVE HIM BEFORE HE HAS ENTIRELY LOST HIS HEART
NED'S THE MAN
M AND WAS RAPIDLY FINDING CONSOLATION IN THE REGARD OF F
LET S COOK EM THEN THEY LL BE GOOD AND WE CAN PUT SOME AWAY IN OUR LITTLE PAILS FOR TO-MORROW THAT WILL BE SPLENDID
I FORBID YOU TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS MOORE
THIS WILL SUIT YOU BETTER FAN AND GRANDMA READ WHAT A FRIEND HAD SENT HER AS A PENDANT TO ANNE'S LITTLE PICTURE OF LONDON LIFE LONG AGO
GRANDMA TOO WAS GLAD TO FIND WILLING HANDS AND FEET TO SERVE HER
SHE DID NOT SEE POLLY CATCH UP THE PICTURE AND LOOK AT IT WITH HUNGRY EYES BUT SHE DID HEAR SOMETHING IN THE LOW TONE IN WHICH POLLY SAID IT DON'T DO HIM JUSTICE AND GLANCING OVER HER SHOULDER FAN'S QUICK EYE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TRUTH THOUGH POLLY WAS HALF TURNED AWAY FROM HER
I M BUSY YOU ALWAYS ARE BUSY
WHAT ARE YOU TAKING YOUR SHOES AND SOCKS OFF FOR
ADDING PROUDLY TREAT THAT OLD GLOVE RESPECTFULLY MY CHILDREN FOR LAFAYETTE'S HONORED HAND HAS TOUCHED IT OH GRANDMA DID YOU WEAR IT
CREEPING TO THE WINDOW I WAS IN TIME TO SEE BY THE DIM MOONLIGHT A SHADOW GLIDE ROUND THE CORNER AND DISAPPEAR
HE LOOKED AT HER EXCITED FACE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF IT AND REMEMBERED ALL AT ONCE THAT HE WAS TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND A GIRL
ANOTHER PLEASURE WAS TO LET HIM HELP CLEAR AWAY AS THEY USED TO DO AT HOME WHILE THE PEALS OF LAUGHTER THAT ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED THIS PERFORMANCE DID MISS MILLS HEART GOOD TO HEAR FOR THE ROOM WAS SO SMALL AND WILL SO BIG THAT HE SEEMED TO BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE AND POLLY AND PUTTEL WERE CONTINUALLY DODGING HIS LONG ARMS AND LEGS
THAT MIGHT DO GOOD ALL ROUND NO
EVENING BROUGHT POLLY TO WHAT SHE CALLED A FESTIVE TEA AND WHEN THEY GATHERED ROUND THE TABLE ANOTHER GIFT APPEARED WHICH THOUGH NOT OF A SENTIMENTAL NATURE TOUCHED TOM MORE THAN ALL THE REST
ADIEU YOURS ETERNALLY FLORENCE
WHILE FANNY CONSCIENCE STRICKEN LAID BACK THE POOR LITTLE PRESENTS WITH A RESPECTFUL HAND FOR SOMEHOW THE THOUGHT OF POLLY'S POVERTY CAME OVER HER AS IT NEVER HAD DONE BEFORE
PRESENTLY IN CAME THE BOYS
HELP ONE ANOTHER IS PART OF THE RELIGION OF OUR SISTERHOOD FAN I MUST PUT YOU IN A STORY POLLY
O DEAR NO
MAMMA WON'T HAVE IT CUT UP AND MY ERMINE ONE MUST BE KEPT FOR BEST AND FANNY SMOOTHED HER BISMARK KIDS WITH AN INJURED AIR
IT S MY PRIVATE OPINION THAT YOU ARE TAKING AS WELL AS GIVING LESSONS MISS SAID FAN PUTTING ON A PLAYFULLY STERN AIR TO HIDE HER REAL ANXIETY
GIRLS HEADS ALWAYS DO ACHE ANSWERED TOM SUBSIDING FROM A ROAR INTO A CHUCKLE
YOU PROPOSED GETTING THE PLUMS NOW LET S SEE YOU DO IT ANSWERED NELLY RATHER CROSSLY FOR SHE HAD BITTEN THE GREEN PLUM AND IT PUCKERED HER MOUTH
FOR KATE HAD WRITTEN A SUCCESSFUL BOOK BY ACCIDENT AND HAPPENED TO BE THE FASHION JUST THEN
FOR LOOKING OVER THE BANISTERS WAS TOM'S FACE CROCKY BUT TRIUMPHANT AND IN EITHER HAND A JUNK OF CANDY WHICH HE WAVED ABOVE THEM AS HE VANISHED WITH THE TANTALIZING REMARK DON'T YOU WISH YOU HAD SOME HOW IN THE WORLD DID HE GET OUT CRIED FANNY STEADYING HERSELF AFTER A START THAT NEARLY SENT ALL THREE TUMBLING DOWN STAIRS
HEY
ANNA IS GOING TO ITALY CRIED KATE TOSSING UP HER BONNET LIKE A SCHOOL-BOY
HE S PRETTY DRUNK
YES FOR SYD NOT FOR POLLY
AND TOM RETURNING FROM AN UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH WAS AMAZED TO BEHOLD POLLY CIRCLING GRACEFULLY ABOUT THE ROOM GUIDED BY A MOST ACCOMPLISHED PARTNER
HAVE AN ARM SIR
TELL ME WHEN THE KETTLE BOILS AND DON'T STEP ON NICODEMUS WHATEVER YOU DO WHAT A CAPITAL HOUSE-KEEPER YOU WILL MAKE SOME DAY SAID FANNY AS SHE WATCHED POLLY SPREAD HER TABLE WITH A NEATNESS AND DESPATCH WHICH WAS PLEASANT TO BEHOLD
AND YOU NEED N'T MIND OLD MONSIEUR A BIT OR READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
POLLY AND MAUD WILLINGLY WENT AND WATCHED HIS STRUGGLES WITH DEEP INTEREST TILL HE GOT AN UPSET WHICH NEARLY PUT AN END TO HIS VELOCIPEDING FOREVER
I KNOW YOU WOULD BUT YOU HAVE ALL BEEN SO KIND TO ME I DID N'T WANT TO TROUBLE YOU WITH MY LITTLE PLANS TILL THE FIRST STEPS WERE TAKEN
WELL HE OUGHT
I WISH THEY WERE BUT I M AFRAID THEY ARE NOT
BUT IT SOUNDED SO TRAGICAL THAT SHE SAW IT WOULD N'T PASS AND HASTENED TO HIDE THE FAILURE BY SAYING WITH A LAUGH IF YOU CALL TRIX PASSE AT TWENTY-THREE WHAT SHALL WE ALL BE AT TWENTY-FIVE UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
OH WELL I KEEP MEETING SYD AND POLLY CIRCULATING IN THE SAME DIRECTIONS
OH THEY LAUGH AT EVERYTHING THE LEAST BIT ODD AND THAT IS N'T PLEASANT FANNY DID N'T SAY COUNTRIFIED BUT SHE MEANT IT AND POLLY FELT UNCOMFORTABLE
BUT IF YOU COULD GET A GLIMPSE OF IT IT WOULD MAKE YOUR HEARTS ACHE AS IT HAS MINE DO YOU SUFFER FROM HEARTACHE
BUT MR SHAW DID NOT LAUGH WHEN HE HAD READ THE SENTIMENTAL VERSES ACCOMPANYING THE BOUQUET AND HIS FACE QUITE SCARED POLLY AS HE ASKED ANGRILY HOW LONG HAS THIS NONSENSE BEEN GOING ON INDEED SIR I DON'T KNOW
IF HE WAS I SHOULD HATE HIM
HERE IS REAL CREAM BROWN BREAD HOME-MADE CAKE AND HONEY FROM MY OWN BEEHIVES
EACH TAKE ONE AND CHOOSE SOMETHING FROM IT FOR ME TO TELL ABOUT SAID MADAM QUITE EXCITED AT THE UNUSUAL INTEREST IN HER TREASURES
DEAR MISS MILLS TELL ME WHAT TO DO LET ME HELP YOU I M READY FOR ANYTHING SAID POLLY VERY HUMBLY FOR HER OWN TROUBLES LOOKED SO SMALL AND FOOLISH BESIDE THE STERN HARDSHIPS WHICH HAD NEARLY HAD SO TRAGICAL AN END THAT SHE FELT HEARTILY ASHAMED OF HERSELF AND QUITE BURNED TO ATONE FOR THEM
THAT WAS ALL SHE WANTED
SO DULL SO STRICT
OH ME
OH ME
OH ME
MUST BE BECOMING
WHAT PUT IT INTO YOUR HEAD DEMANDED FANNY TWIRLING ROUND AGAIN SO THAT HER FACE WAS HIDDEN
SHE CAME AND SAW US AND WAS VERY KIND AND HAS GOT THESE PUPILS FOR ME LIKE A DEAR GOOD WOMAN AS SHE IS WHERE DID YOU LEARN SO MUCH WORLDLY WISDOM POLLY ASKED MR SHAW AS HIS WIFE FELL BACK IN HER CHAIR AND TOOK OUT HER SALTS AS IF THIS DISCOVERY HAD BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HER
THAT WAS SPLENDID
POLLY WAS TO GO DIRECTLY AFTER AN EARLY DINNER AND HAVING PACKED HER TRUNK ALL BUT ONE TRAY SHE WAS TOLD TO GO AND TAKE A RUN WHILE GRANDMA FINISHED
I NEVER LIKED TRIX AND I HOPE IT S ONLY A BOY-AND-GIRL FANCY THAT WILL SOON DIE A NATURAL DEATH SAID MR SHAW WHO SEEMED TO FIND IT DIFFICULT TO HELP FALLING INTO A BROWN STUDY IN SPITE OF THE LIVELY CHATTER GOING ON ABOUT HIM
I VE HAD A FEELING FOR SOME TIME THAT TRIX AND I WERE NOT SUITED TO ONE ANOTHER AND IT MIGHT BE WISER TO STOP SHORT
AT FIRST MR SHAW DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT IT
THEN THINGS WERE SO DESPERATE I THOUGHT I MIGHT AS WELL FACE THE TRUTH SO I OVERHAULED MY ACCOUNTS AND THERE S THE RESULT TOM THREW A BLOTTED CRUMPLED PAPER INTO POLLY'S LAP AND TRAMPED UP AND DOWN AGAIN FASTER THAN EVER
WHERE IS THE MOLASSES
IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO PATRONIZE THE LITTLE MUSIC-TEACHER BUT IT WAS NOT SO PLEASANT TO HAVE HER SETTLED IN THE FAMILY
CAN'T WE LEND YOU ANYTHING MY DEAR
SNIP'S GOT IT
THAT WAS A BLOW FOR YOU SEE FAN SINCE TRIX BROKE THE ENGAGEMENT AND IT WAS N'T WRONG TO THINK OF TOM I LET MYSELF HOPE JUST A LITTLE AND WAS SO HAPPY
BUT YOU HAVE N'T AND I WOULD N'T GIVE A SIXPENCE FOR YOU THAT S POLITE SAID POLLY GETTING RUFFLED
TOM TOOK A QUICK LOOK AT HER OVER HIS SHOULDER AND PAUSED AS IF THE FIRE WAS SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED
CONFIDE IN ME AS I DO IN YOU SAID FANNY TENDERLY FOR ALL THE COLDNESS SHE HAD TRIED TO HIDE FROM POLLY HAD MELTED IN THE SUDDEN SUNSHINE THAT HAD COME TO HER
WHAT PUT THAT INTO YOUR HEAD CHILD CRIED POLLY
I WON'T STAND IT PROMISE NOT TO PLAGUE FAN AND I LL LET YOU OUT WON'T PROMISE ANYTHING
LITTLE JANE HAS KILLED HERSELF AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE SAID LEADING ME UP TO THE ATTIC WHO WAS LITTLE JANE BROKE IN POLLY DROPPING HER WORK
NO DEAR
WHAT'S SHE TIRED OF
HE SAID HIS PLANS WERE NOT MADE BUT HE MEANT TO GO INTO THE LITTLE HOUSE THAT BELONGED TO GRANDMA AS SOON AS HE COULD FOR IT WAS N'T HONEST FOR A BANKRUPT TO KEEP UP AN ESTABLISHMENT LIKE THIS I SHAN'T MIND THAT AT ALL I LIKE THE LITTLE HOUSE CAUSE IT S GOT A GARDEN AND THERE S A CUNNING ROOM WITH A THREE-CORNERED CLOSET IN IT THAT I ALWAYS WANTED
I DON'T LIKE IT AND I WON'T HAVE IT SAID TOM DECIDEDLY
INSTEAD OF SLEEPING LATER THAN USUAL THAT MORNING SHE WAS ALWAYS UP BRIGHT AND EARLY FLYING ROUND TO GET READY FOR HER GUEST FOR WILL CAME TO BREAKFAST AND THEY MADE A LONG DAY OF IT
AND MAUD SLUMBERED PLACIDLY HUGGING THE STICKY BUNDLE FOUND WHERE MOLASSES CANDY IS NOT OFTEN DISCOVERED
HOW DIFFERENT ASKED POLLY AGAIN FOR SHE LIKED TO UNDERSTAND THINGS
TELL HER I SAY SO SAID MR SHAW
THEN SHE WAS LONELY FOR WILL COULD ONLY COME ONCE A WEEK HER LEISURE HOURS WERE FANNY'S BUSIEST AND THE BITS OF PLEASURE WERE SO FEW AND FAR BETWEEN THAT THEY ONLY TANTALIZED HER
COME AND TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT NO YOU LL ONLY LAUGH AT ME I GIVE YOU MY WORD I WON'T IF I CAN HELP IT
AND WHEN SHE SAW HIM LEAN BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH THE OLD HEARTY LAUGH SHE WAS SATISFIED AND BLESSED THE UNLUCKY PIE FOR AMUSING HIM
FOR IF SHE UNDERTAKES TO BE INDEPENDENT SHE LL DO IT IN THE MOST THOROUGH MANNER ANSWERED FANNY AND MRS SHAW SINCERELY HOPED SHE WOULD
WELL HE IS SO YOU NEED N'T LAUGH FOR WE VE MADE ALL OUR PLANS SAID MAUD WITH COMICAL DIGNITY AS SHE TRIED THE EFFECT OF AN OLD WHITE BONNET WONDERING IF FARMERS WIVES COULD WEAR OSTRICH FEATHERS WHEN THEY WENT TO MEETING
POLLY SAW IT
AND IF I DON'T GO AMONG THE BOYS I CAN'T SEE WHAT HARM THERE IS IN IT SAID POLLY BEFORE MADAM COULD SPEAK
AND FEELING SURE THAT HER PATRIOTIC FRIENDS WOULD GLADLY LAY THEIR COWS ON THE ALTAR OF THEIR COUNTRY MADAM HANCOCK COVERED HERSELF WITH GLORY BY CALMLY ISSUING THE COMMAND MILK EM IT WAS DONE TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF THE COWS AND THE ENTIRE SATISFACTION OF THE GUESTS AMONG WHOM WAS LAFAYETTE
WHAT A MARTYR THAT GIRL DOES MAKE OF HERSELF AND FANNY LOOKED AS SOLEMN AS IF POLLY HAD PROPOSED SOME AWFUL SELF-SACRIFICE
FOR SHE KNEW HER WEAKNESS AND BEYOND THAT BLACK SILK SHE HAD DETERMINED NOT TO GO
ME AND BLANCHE WERE COMING HOME JUST NOW AND WE SAW HER AND TOM WIDING DOWN THE HILL ON HIS SLED AND THEN HE DWAGGED HER EVER SO FAR CRIED MAUD WITH HER MOUTH FULL
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE HE WILL EVER BE ANYTHING BUT A POET IN NAME SAID POLLY WORKING AWAY WHILE SHE TALKED
YOU LL HURT HER TOM
THAT WOULD N'T BE BAD
POLLY WAS TOO UNCONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH LOVE HAD MADE IN HERSELF TO UNDERSTAND AT FIRST THE CAUSE OF HER FRIEND'S NEW PATIENCE AND FORTITUDE
FOR TRIX HAD BEEN TELLING HER OF ALL SORTS OF FUN IN WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD A SHARE IF POLLY HAD HELD HER TONGUE
BESIDES HE S ENGAGED AND DOES PUT ON SUCH AIRS BROKE IN MAUD WHO REGARDED HER BROTHER AS A VENERABLE BEING
TELL ALL ABOUT IT EXCLAIMED THE GIRLS GATHERING ROUND THE SPEAKER
I LL TRY THE OLD PLAN AND PUT MYSELF RIGHT BY DOING SOME LITTLE KINDNESS TO SOMEBODY
NOW I SHALL GIVE THAT TO MAMMA TO TAKE HER PILLS IN
OUIDA'S ARE MY DELIGHT ONLY THEY ARE SO LONG I GET WORN OUT BEFORE I M THROUGH I HAVE N'T READ ANYTHING BUT ONE OF THE MUHLBACH NOVELS SINCE I CAME
MY DEAREST CONSTANCE AFTER THREE MONTHS OF INTENSE EXCITEMENT I SNATCH A LEISURE MOMENT TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I ENJOY MY FIRST VISIT TO LONDON
SO SHE SHOOK OUT HER LITTLE BLACK SILK APRON WITH A THOUGHTFUL FACE AND RESOLVED NOT TO ALLUDE TO HER OWN HOME IF SHE COULD HELP IT
WE ALL GO TO THE AFTERNOON CONCERTS AND HAVE A GAY TIME AND BELLE AND TRIX ARE TO BE THERE TO-DAY
THAT S THE WAY TRIX SAYS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A BALL-BOOK LOOKING MUCH GRATIFIED TOM PRODUCED THE STUMP OF A LEAD-PENCIL AND WROTE HIS NAME WITH A FLOURISH SAYING AS HE GAVE IT BACK NOW I M GOING TO GET SHERRY OR SOME OF THE FELLOWS THAT DO THE REDOWA WELL SO YOU CAN HAVE A REAL GOOD GO BEFORE THE MUSIC STOPS OFF WENT TOM
YOU DEAR THING WHEN DID YOU COME CRIED FANNY KISSING BOTH THE BLOOMING CHECKS WITH REAL AFFECTION WHILE THE REST HOVERED NEAR WAITING FOR A CHANCE
POLLY HAD NEVER BEEN MUCH TO THE THEATRE
HOW MEAN THE DOLLAR LOOKED ALL ALONE
HERE S A BOOK WITH LOTS OF PICTURES IN IT
THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH TALK HER FATHER COULD N'T BEAR IT AND TOOK THE WHOLE FAMILY OFF
AND THE OTHER DAY WHEN BETSEY WAS OUT PARADING IN HER MISSIS'S CAST-OFF PURPLE PLUSH SUIT MR CURTIS THOUGHT SHE WAS MADEMOISELLE AND BOWED TO HER
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT SAID TOM FLAPPING THE RUBBERS ABOUT WITHOUT ANY SIGNS OF HASTE
ALL SORTS OF STORIES FLEW THROUGH THE TOWN WE WERE LIVING IN THE COUNTRY THEN
FOR WHERE EVERYTHING SEEMED STRANGE AND NEW TO FAN POLLY WAS QUITE AT HOME AND EVERY ONE OF THE UNFASHIONABLE DOMESTIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS NOW CAME INTO PLAY TO THE COMFORT OF THE SHAWS AND THE GREAT SATISFACTION OF POLLY
HE CAME TO EXAMINE THE PREMISES I M SURE OF IT BUT WE WILL BE READY FOR HIM I SAID FIERCELY AS I TOLD THE FAMILY ABOUT HIM
IS N'T IT SAID TOM WIPING HIS RED FACE WITH SUCH AN AIR OF INTENSE RELIEF THAT POLLY HAD NOT THE HEART TO SCOLD HIM BUT SAID THANK YOU AND DROPPED INTO A CHAIR EXHAUSTED
IS N'T HE A TRUMP POLLY AND TOM'S FACE SHONE WITH PRIDE EVEN WHILE HIS LIPS WOULD TWITCH WITH A TENDERER FEELING
THERE S A DEAR I WILL WHISPERED SISTER ANN
LIKEWISE HER SCARLET-AND-BLACK SUIT WITH ITS BIG SASH LITTLE PANNIER BRIGHT BUTTONS POINTS ROSETTES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT
HUNGER OF ANY SORT IS A HARD THING TO BEAR ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SUFFERER HAS A YOUTHFUL APPETITE AND POLLY WAS KEPT ON SUCH A SHORT ALLOWANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS THAT SHE GOT QUITE THIN AND INTERESTING
I MUST LOOK NICE FOR TOM SELDOM TAKES ME AND OUGHT TO BE GRATIFIED WHEN HE DOES
DON'T HE LOVE BACK AGAIN NO
SHE IS MY COMPANY AND I AM TRYING TO ENTERTAIN HER FOR I LOVE TO HAVE HER COME SAID GRANDMA WITH HER OLD-TIME POLITENESS
THAT S WHAT I THINK OH THE DEUCE
THERE S NOTHING TO TELL AIN'T THERE THOUGH
TOM WAS JUST GOING TO GIVE IT A HEARTY SHAKE WHEN HE SAW A RED MARK ON THE WRIST AND KNEW WHAT MADE IT
I SAW EM LAUGH AND BLUSH AND POKE ONE ANOTHER AND I KNEW IT WAS N'T ABOUT ANY OLD QUEEN ELIZABETH MAN CRIED MAUD TURNING UP HER NOSE AS FAR AS THAT SOMEWHAT LIMITED FEATURE WOULD GO
SOMEBODY WANTS ME TO PLAY AND I D RATHER LEARN OF YOU THAN ANY SENOR TWANKYDILLO SAID TOM WHO DID N'T FIND THE CONVERSATION INTERESTING
POOH
POOH
POOH
I THINK YOU ARE BATS SOMETIMES BUT WOMEN ARE TAUGHT TO WEAR MASKS AND THAT ACCOUNTS FOR IT I SUPPOSE I DON'T AGREE
YOU ARE SINCERE IN YOUR WISH TO HELP BETTER THEM AND YOU RESPECT THOSE WHO WORK FOR THAT END YES I DO THEN MY DEAR CAN'T YOU BEAR A LITTLE RIDICULE FOR THE SAKE OF A GOOD CAUSE
I NEVER SAW HER DRAW SAID TOM
THESE THOUGHTS CAME AND WENT AS HE WATCHED THE WHITE FIGURE IN FRONT FELT THE ENCHANTMENT OF THE MUSIC AND FOUND EVERYBODY UNUSUALLY BLITHE AND BEAUTIFUL
FLY
HOW ODD THESE AMERICANS ARE WITH THEIR MONEY AND TALENT AND INDEPENDENCE
FANNY WAS AMUSED TO SEE THAT THE GIRLS DID NOT KISS AT PARTING BUT SHOOK HANDS IN A QUIET FRIENDLY FASHION LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER WITH EYES THAT SAID MORE THAN THE MOST GUSHING WORDS
IN OTHERS THE PLUMS SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND WE LOOK FOR THEM IN VAIN AS WE GO ON AND OFTEN COME TO THEM WHEN IT IS TOO LATE TO ENJOY THEM
IT WILL BE DONE IN TIME AND THE DRESS LIKEWISE SO LOOK YOUR PRETTIEST AND ACCEPT MY BLESSING CONTINUED POLLY SEEING THAT FAN LIKED HER RAILLERY
THIS IS SILLY AND WICKED AND CAN'T BE ALLOWED
AFTER HEARING ABOUT THAT CARRIE AND THE REST I DON'T WONDER HE IS FUSSY
DOWN WENT THE ROPE AND WITH A LONG PULL A STRONG PULL AND A PULL ALL TOGETHER WE HOISTED POOR SALLY HALF-WAY UP TO THE WINDOW WHEN SAD TO TELL THE ROPE SLIPPED AND DOWN SHE FELL ONLY BEING SAVED FROM BROKEN BONES BY THE HAY-COCK UNDER THE WINDOW
PUSHING OPEN THE DOOR SHE WENT QUIETLY INTO THE DIMLY LIGHTED ROOM AND ON THE PILLOW SAW A FACE THAT DREW HER TO IT WITH AN IRRESISTIBLE POWER FOR IT WAS TOUCHED BY A SOLEMN SHADOW THAT MADE ITS YOUTH PATHETIC
IT OUGHT TO BE THICK AND NICE LIKE MAMMA'S I LL POUR OFF SOME OF THE JUICE AND WE CAN DRINK IT SAID I FEELING THAT I D MADE A MISTAKE IN MY COOKING
BUT THOUGH HE IS MY BROTHER I DON'T THINK HE S GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU POLLY AND I DON'T QUITE SEE HOW YOU CAN CARE FOR HIM SO MUCH WHEN YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A PERSON SO INFINITELY SUPERIOR I DON'T WANT A SUPERIOR PERSON
BUT DEAR ME HOW CAN ONE WHEN EVERYTHING IS SO STUPID AND TIRESOME IF EVER A GIRL NEEDED WORK IT S YOU CRIED POLLY
A GLIMPSE OF WET EYELASHES A ROUND CHEEK REDDER THAN USUAL AND LIPS PARTED BY QUICK BREATHING RELIEVED HIS MIND UPON THAT POINT
THAT WAS ALL I WANTED WHISPERED POLLY IN A TONE WHICH CAUSED HIM TO FEEL THAT THE RACE OF ANGELS WAS NOT ENTIRELY EXTINCT
NOW I SUPPOSE YOU LL GO AND TELL PAPA A GREAT STORY P'R'APS I SHALL AND P'R'APS I SHAN'T
BUT OF COURSE YOU WILL ADDED POLLY SITTING STILL WHILE AN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION BEGAN TO STEAL OVER HER HAPPY FACE
SO HE CONSOLED HIMSELF WITH MAUD WHO NOW BEING IN HER TEENS ASSUMED DIGNIFIED AIRS AND ORDERED HIM ABOUT IN A STYLE THAT AFFORDED HIM CONTINUED AMUSEMENT AND EMPLOYMENT
AND ALTHOUGH I CANNOT HELP LAUGHING AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THIS YOU MUST NOT THINK CHILD THAT I APPROVE OF SUCH CONDUCT OR EXCUSE IT
SHE WAS NOT WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW WHERE THE TROUBLE LAY
BUT HE LL HELP YOU WON'T HE
POLLY S MAD SUNG MAUD SKIPPING ROPE ROUND THE ROOM
MAMMA'S LITTLE PROPERTY IS SETTLED UPON HER AND HAS N'T BEEN RISKED
IT S YOUR OWN FAULT IF YOU RE HURT
WE VE GOT SARDINES CRACKERS AND CHEESE SAID BESS CLEARING OFF A TABLE WITH ALL SPEED
BUT MISS MAUD WAS MUCH ABSORBED IN HER OWN AFFAIRS FOR SHE BELONGED TO A SET ALSO
GOOD-BY POLLY AND MR THOMAS DEPARTED HOPING THAT BY THE SKILLFUL CHANGE OF TONE FROM ARDENT IMPATIENCE TO CONDESCENDING COOLNESS HE HAD IMPRESSED ONE HEARER AT LEAST WITH THE FACT THAT HE REGARDED TRIX AS THE STAR OF HIS EXISTENCE AND POLLY AS A PRESUMING LITTLE CHIT
THE BIG HOUSE WAS GIVEN UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THE LITTLE HOUSE TAKEN
I ONLY KNOW THAT IF POLLY HAD SUSPECTED THAT A LITTLE WATCH WAS TICKING AWAY IN A LITTLE CASE WITH HER NAME ON IT INSIDE THAT TRUNK SHE NEVER COULD HAVE LEFT IT LOCKED AS GRANDMA ADVISED OR HAVE EATEN HER DINNER SO QUIETLY
AND I SHALL KEEP HER AS LONG AS SHE S HAPPY SHE WON'T STAY LONG THEN IF I CAN HELP IT MUTTERED TOM WHO REGARDED GIRLS AS A VERY UNNECESSARY PORTION OF CREATION
GUESS YOU VE KILLED YOUR HORSE RACING WORSE THAN THAT YOU ARE SUSPENDED AGAIN WORSE THAN THAT TRIX HAS RUN AWAY WITH SOMEBODY CRIED POLLY WITH A GASP
AND PARTIES WILL BE QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR ME YOU DON'T INTEND TO WORK ALL THE TIME WITHOUT A BIT OF FUN I HOPE CRIED FANNY DISMAYED AT THE IDEA
WHY MR MERTON DID
I WISH YOU KNEW THEM FAN
I M GETTING THE WORST OF IT ANYWAY
I SHOULD N'T WONDER IF THIS WAS A GOOD THING FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY THOUGH IT DON'T LOOK SO
OCH MURTHER AND IT S KILT I AM
AND BOTH FAN AND MAUD INSISTED ON GOING TOO
BRIGHT BOY
MAKE HER AS LIKE YOURSELF AS POSSIBLE MY DEAR
IT S MY OPINION SHE IS GOING TO OPEN A SCHOOL OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT TO HELP THOSE BROTHERS OF HERS ALONG SAID MR SHAW WHO HAD PUT DOWN HIS PAPER AT THE SOUND OF POLLY'S NAME
I LL SEE TO YOUR SWEETBREAD MUM
IF I WAS THE PRESIDENT I D MAKE A LAW TO SHUT UP ALL BOYS TILL THEY WERE GROWN
I THINK IT S MEAN TO TAKE A LITTLE GIRL'S THINGS AWAY AND MAUD DIVED AMONG THE PILLOWS TO SMOTHER A WAIL OF ANGUISH AT THE PROSPECT OF BEING BEREFT OF HER TREASURES
JIMMY USED TO COME ROUND FIRST AND SAY ALL SERENE POLLY SO KIND AND JOLLY THAT I COULD N'T HELP LAUGHING AND BEING FRIENDS RIGHT AWAY DID HE NOT KNOW A LOT YES I THINK HE DID FOR HE LIKED TO STUDY AND WANTED TO GET ON SO HE COULD HELP FATHER
OH TOM WHAT IS IT CRIED POLLY HURRYING TO HIM FULL OF FEARS SHE DARED NOT SPEAK
WHERE IS YOUR ROOM ASKED MAUD
MAUD WAS TAKEN TO THE SEASIDE WITH BELLE
FORTUNATELY HE WAS SPARED THE TRIAL AND WENT AWAY HOPING THAT THE COQUETRIES OF HIS TRIX WOULD MAKE HIM FORGET POLLY'S LOOK WHEN SHE ANSWERED HIS QUESTION
DID YOU SEE HIM
NEVER MY DEAR
AND DID THE LATTER SO WELL THAT IT GOT TO BE A REGULAR THING FOR HER TO BEGIN AS SOON AS TWILIGHT CAME AND TOM WAS SETTLED IN HIS FAVORITE PLACE ON GRANDMA'S SOFA
AND I WON'T TELL IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH SHE SAID WITH AN ELOQUENT LITTLE CHOKE IN HER VOICE
I M SO POORLY MAMMA SAYS I NEED N'T GO TO SCHOOL REGULARLY WHILE YOU ARE HERE ONLY TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK JUST TO KEEP UP MY MUSIC AND FRENCH
I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE S SOME RELATION OF YOURS I BELIEVE SAID BELLE IN A LOW TONE
POLLY IS HOLDING FORTH HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE WENT QUIETLY UP STAIRS AND THE STEADY MURMUR OF A PLEASANT VOICE CAME DOWN TO HIM
YOU LL CHANGE YOUR MIND THEN POOR CHILD SAID FANNY WHOSE IDEAS OF FAILURE WERE DECIDEDLY TRAGICAL
WHAT'S-HIS-NAME IS A GREAT JACK NOT TO SEE THAT SHE ADORES HIM
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR DAYS OF MISFORTUNE LIKE LITTLE ROSAMOND AND POLLY WAS BEGINNING TO THINK SHE HAD MORE THAN HER SHARE
THE WATCH WAS SET AT THE ENTRY DOOR THE SIGNAL AGREED UPON THE CANDLE LIGHTED AND THE FEAST SPREAD FORTH UPON A NEWSPAPER ON THE BED WITH THE COVERLET ARRANGED SO THAT IT COULD BE WHISKED OVER THE REFRESHMENTS AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
WE MUST TRY TO CHEER HER UP AMONG US
HE SAID IF I DID WELL AT SCHOOL FOR A MONTH I SHOULD HAVE IT
HE WAS N'T RESPECTFUL AT ALL
THEY TALKED ABOUT THINGS OF WHICH SHE KNEW NOTHING AND WHEN FANNY TRIED TO EXPLAIN SHE DID N'T FIND THEM INTERESTING
NOBODY LIKES TO BE TALKED TO BUT NOBODY CAN RESIST THE ELOQUENCE OF UNCONSCIOUS PREACHING
THE ONLY WAY I CAN EXPLAIN IT IS THAT IT S A FAMILY TRAIT AND AS NATURAL TO THE BROTHER AS IT IS TO THE SISTER IT S A SHAW TRAIT TO DO THE SAME
JUST YOU READ THAT AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF IT TOM SNATCHED A LETTER OFF THE TABLE PUT IT INTO HER HANDS AND BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE LITTLE ROOM LIKE A VERITABLE BEAR IN ITS CAGE
ONLY MY BEST CUFFS AND COLLAR
I KNOW ONE FRIEND WHO WILL BE KINDER THAN EVER OH POLLY DO YOU THINK SO AND FANNY'S EYES SOFTENED WITH SUDDEN TEARS
NO IT S A MUCH BETTER AND DEARER FRIEND THAN I AM SAID POLLY PINCHING FANNY'S CHEEK AS IT REDDENED PRETTILY UNDER HER EYES
ONE HALF AN HOUR AND THEN ANOTHER ELAPSED AND TOM DID NOT RETURN
BUT I VE HAD A FEELING THAT YOU WERE GOING THROUGH A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN ANY OF US GUESSED PRETTY TOUGH WORK AT FIRST I OWN
TELL ME TRULY HAVE YOU NEVER REPENTED OF YOUR HINT TO SYDNEY NEVER CRIED POLLY THROWING BACK THE BROWN VEIL BEHIND WHICH SHE HAD HALF HIDDEN HER FACE AT FIRST
POLLY WAS NEVER TOO SAD PERTURBED OR LAZY TO SING FOR IT WAS ALMOST AS EASY TO HER AS BREATHING AND SEEMED THE MOST NATURAL OUTLET FOR HER EMOTIONS
THAT WAS N'T WHAT I BEGAN TO SAY
POLLY WISHED THE CHILDREN WOULD BE KINDER TO GRANDMA
DO I LOOK HAPPY
BUT AS THE DOOR SHUT BEHIND HER SHE FELT SO LEFT OUT IN THE COLD THAT HER EYES FILLED AND WHEN NEP TOM'S GREAT NEWFOUNDLAND CAME BLUNDERING AFTER HER SHE STOPPED AND HUGGED HIS SHAGGY HEAD SAYING SOFTLY AS SHE LOOKED INTO THE BROWN BENEVOLENT EYES FULL OF ALMOST HUMAN SYMPATHY
I OUGHT TO GO AND MAKE CALLS SAID FANNY BUT I DON'T FEEL NOW AS IF I EVER WANTED TO SEE ANY OF THE GIRLS AGAIN
POLLY HAD LEARNED THIS SECRET
BUT WHEN SHE SAID TOM DEAR YOUR FATHER WANTS YOU HE GOT UP AT ONCE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HER SAYING COME TOO WE CAN'T GET ON WITHOUT YOU AND TOOK HER BACK INTO THE STUDY WITH HIM
POOR MARY WAS NEARLY CAUGHT FOR MISS COTTON WAS QUICKER THAN BETSEY AND OUR GUARD HAD TO RUN FOR HER LIFE
MISS PERKINS A GRAVE COLD-LOOKING YOUNG LADY WITH AN ARISTOCRATIC NOSE BOWED POLITELY AND THEN WENT ON WITH HER WORK WHICH DISPLAYED TWO DIAMOND RINGS TO GREAT ADVANTAGE
IT WILL HELP OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE YOU CHEERFUL JUST WHAT TOM SAID,'KEEP JOLLY
I DO THINK FAN WOULD SUIT HIM EXCELLENTLY BY AND BY
I WANTED TO GO TO PAPA WHEN HE CAME DOWN BUT THE DOOR WAS LOCKED AND HE SAID NOT NOW MY LITTLE GIRL AND THEN I SAT HERE WAITING TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AND TOM CAME HOME
HE S HORRID RUDE MY SISTER SAYS RETORTED ALICE
HE THREATENED TO SEND A MAID TO SCHOOL WITH ME EVERY DAY AS THEY DO IN NEW YORK TO BE SURE I COME ALL RIGHT
THANK YOU POLLY
HER BROTHERS APPRECIATE THEIR SISTERS OBSERVED FANNY IN HER SHARP TONE
WHY OF COURSE I SHAN'T THAT LITTLE ROMANCE RUNS SMOOTHLY SO FAR
HOPE YOU LL ENJOY YOURSELF AND THEN APPEARED TO FORGET HER ENTIRELY
SINCE HE IS SAFE WITH FANNY I MAY VENTURE TO WALK WHERE I LIKE
I DON'T WANT MY POLLY TO BE LOVED FOR HER CLOTHES BUT FOR HERSELF
SO GO AND TAKE THIS WRAPPER WITH YOU
THEY DID N'T SAY ANYTHING THEN OR MAKE ANY PLANS OR CONFESS ANY FAULTS
YOU SAID YESTERDAY THAT YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE IT A PRINCIPLE OF YOUR LIFE TO HELP UP YOUR SEX AS FAR AND AS FAST AS YOU COULD
POLLY FELT MUCH COMFORTED
IT DON'T DO TO THINK OF HER AND I WON'T SAID POLLY TO HERSELF SETTING HER LIPS WITH A GRIM LOOK THAT WAS NOT AT ALL BECOMING
MY INDULGENT MOTHER BOUGHT ME YESTERDAY AT A MERCHANT'S IN CHEAPSIDE THREE NEW SHIFTS THAT COST FOURTEEN PENCE AN ELL AND I AM TO HAVE A PAIR OF NEW STUFF SHOES FOR MY LORD OF NORFOLK'S BALL WHICH WILL BE THREE SHILLINGS
WHAT IS IT ASKED TOM FORGETTING HIS HONORABLE RESOLVES FOR A MINUTE
SOME NEW NEIGHBORS CAME TO CALL AND EXPRESSED A WISH TO SEE US HAVING BEEN TOLD THAT WE WERE PATTERN CHILDREN
YOU HAVE WORKED AND WAITED SO LONG A LARGE DOSE WILL DO YOU GOOD SAID REBECCA GIVING HER A GENEROUS SPOONFUL OF JAM AS IF EAGER TO ADD AS MUCH SWEETNESS AS POSSIBLE TO A LIFE THAT HAD NOT BEEN AN EASY ONE
BUT IT CAN'T BE STAVED OFF ANY LONGER AND IT S ALL UP WITH HIM OH I WISH I HAD A MILLION TO GIVE HIM CRIED POLLY CLASPING HER HANDS WITH THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN HER CHEEKS
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BOSOM FRIENDS AND AS SPOONY AS EVER WELL I AM FOND OF POLLY BUT I GET TIRED OF HEARING MAUD SING HER PRAISES EVERLASTINGLY
NO I SHOULD N'T CAUSE SHE LL LOOK NICER THAN MY CLAWA
MUST YOU REALLY GO HOME SATURDAY SAID FAN SOME DAYS AFTER WHAT TOM CALLED THE GRAND SCRIMMAGE I REALLY MUST
THEN THEY USED TO INSPECT THE FLOWER POTS PAY NICK A VISIT AND HAVE A LITTLE MUSIC AS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR THE DAY AFTER WHICH THEY WENT TO CHURCH AND DINED WITH MISS MILLS WHO CONSIDERED WILL AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN IF THE AFTERNOON WAS FAIR THEY TOOK A LONG WALK TOGETHER OVER THE BRIDGES INTO THE COUNTRY OR ABOUT THE CITY STREETS FULL OF SABBATH QUIETUDE
BESIDES I DO THINK TOM IS SUPERIOR TO HIM IN MANY THINGS
WHEN DO YOU BEGIN
WHY GRANDMA YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT STORY SAID FANNY HURRYING IN FINDING THE PROSPECT WAS A PLEASANT ONE FOR A STORMY AFTERNOON
I DO ANYWAY AND I THINK SHE S THE KINDEST BEST OLD LADY THAT EVER LIVED AND I LOVE HER DEARLY I DID N'T SAY SHE WAS N'T ONLY OLD PEOPLE ARE SORT OF TEDIOUS AND FUSSY SO I KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY SAID FANNY
BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS AN HONEST LITTLE SOUL AND IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HER THAT THERE WAS ANY NEED OF CONCEALMENT SO SHE ANSWERED IN HER STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY OH THEY AIN'T FOR ME SIR
I DO AS WELL AS I CAN AND PAPA NEED N'T BE ANGRY
THERE I WON'T CROAK ANY MORE
MISS COTTON STOOD STARING ABOUT HER LOOKING SO FUNNY WITHOUT HER CAP THAT MY BEDFELLOW WOULD HAVE GONE OFF IN A FIT OF LAUGHTER IF I HAD NOT PINCHED HER WARNINGLY
WE SHALL BE LATE
YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE YOU HORRID BOY
TALK TROUBLES MOTHER FATHER HAS ENOUGH TO THINK OF WITHOUT ANY OF MY WORRIES
I M SUITED THAT S ENOUGH OH PLEASE JUST TELL ME ONE THING MORE
TO OUTSIDERS THAT WAS A VERY HARD-WORKING AND UNEVENTFUL WINTER TO POLLY
FOR THE HARD-HEARTED LITTLE GRATE WOULD N'T BEHAVE ITSELF TILL SHE HAD USED UP A RUINOUS QUANTITY OF KINDLINGS
MAY I SIT HERE AND TOM TOOK THE LOW FOOTSTOOL THAT ALWAYS STOOD NEAR GRANDMA'S OLD CHAIR
MR JOHN WAS VERY DEAF AND MISS PRISCILLA VERY NEAR-SIGHTED TWO CONVENIENT AFFLICTIONS FOR THE GIRLS ON SOME OCCASIONS BUT ONCE THEY PROVED QUITE THE REVERSE AS YOU SHALL HEAR
I LL GIVE YOU MY BLESSING HE WHISPERED AS THE CURTAIN ROSE AGAIN
THAT S THE WAY FATHER AND MOTHER DID AND I THINK THEY WERE VERY HAPPY IN SPITE OF THE POVERTY AND HARD WORK THEN WE LL DO IT BY ANOTHER YEAR FOR I MUST GET MORE SALARY BEFORE I TAKE YOU AWAY FROM A GOOD HOME HERE
YOU DON'T LIKE IT AND IN ANOTHER SEASON IT WILL BE ALL OUT OF FASHION SAID POLLY FROM HER VERDANT RETREAT
OH DO IF YOU AIN'T AFRAID
IT WILL DO FANNY MORE GOOD THAN HARM AND MR SHAW SAT DOWN LOOKING MORE AMIABLE FOR POLLY'S DISMAY TOUCHED HIM
KEEP BOBBING AND WE LL COME RIGHT BY AND BY MUTTERED TOM GIVING HIS UNFORTUNATE PARTNER A SUDDEN WHISK WHICH NEARLY LANDED BOTH ON THE FLOOR
I DID LOOK IN AND HERE S WHAT I FOUND AS MRS FINN ENDED SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE BACK ATTIC AND I SAW ABOUT AS SAD A SIGHT AS THESE OLD EYES EVER LOOKED AT O WHAT CRIED POLLY PALE NOW WITH INTEREST
FINN PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THE TROUBLE I MAKE YOU BUT I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WAY
CAN'T HE
SHE USED TO WALK ACROSS THE PARK WITH HIM WHEN HE WENT TO HIS OFFICE IN THE MORNING TALKING BUSILY ALL THE WAY AND SAYING GOOD-BY WITH A NOD AND A SMILE WHEN THEY PARTED AT THE GREAT GATE
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW KITTY SAID MAUD FEELING A CURIOUS INTEREST IN A GIRL WHO MADE SUCH PECULIAR PATCHWORK
IT WAS LESS TROUBLE TO LIE STILL AND SAY IN A CONCILIATORY TONE TELL ME SOME MORE ABOUT THIS GOOD BOY IT S VERY INTERESTING NO I SHAN'T BUT I LL TELL ABOUT PUTTEL'S PLAYING ON THE PIANO SAID MAUD ANXIOUS TO EFFACE THE MEMORY OF HER MOMENTARY WEAKNESS
HE LOOKS SO FUNNY WITH WHISKERS BUT HE S EVER SO NICE REAL BIG AND BROWN AND HE SWUNG ME RIGHT UP WHEN HE KISSED ME
WHAT SHALL I DO WITHOUT MY SWEET P AS SYDNEY CALLS YOU SIGHED FANNY BEARING POLLY AWAY TO BE CUDDLED
THEY ARE PAUPERS HERE BUT OUT WEST THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES SO I VE BEGGED THE MONEY TO SEND THEM AND AS SOON AS I CAN GET THEM SOME CLOTHES OFF THEY GO
WHY PAPA
BREAKERS AHEAD GOING INTO THE SHAWS ONE EVENING POLLY FOUND MAUD SITTING ON THE STAIRS WITH A TROUBLED FACE
HOW MANY PIECES DO YOU THINK SHE PUT IN MAUD FIFTY WAS THE WISE REPLY
POLLY WAS REMEMBERING HOW WHEN MRS SHAW CAME HOME THAT DAY IN HER FINE VISITING COSTUME AND MAUD RAN TO WELCOME HER WITH UNUSUAL AFFECTION SHE GATHERED UP HER LUSTROUS SILK AND PUSHED THE LITTLE GIRL AWAY SAYING IMPATIENTLY DON'T TOUCH ME CHILD YOUR HANDS ARE DIRTY THEN THE THOUGHT HAD COME TO POLLY THAT THE VELVET CLOAK DID N'T COVER A RIGHT MOTHERLY HEART THAT THE FRETFUL FACE UNDER THE NODDING PURPLE PLUMES WAS NOT A TENDER MOTHERLY FACE AND THAT THE HANDS IN THE DELICATE PRIMROSE GLOVES HAD PUT AWAY SOMETHING VERY SWEET AND PRECIOUS
HE S VERY GOOD AND GENEROUS AND WISE AND WOULD BE KIND I KNOW BUT SOMEHOW I CAN'T IMAGINE SPENDING MY LIFE WITH HIM
BUT IT DOES N'T SUIT ME TO HAVE YOU GET THIN AND PALE YOU KNOW POLLY LOOKED UP TO THANK HIM BUT NEVER DID FOR THERE WAS SOMETHING DEEPER THAN GRATITUDE IN THE HONEST BLUE EYES THAT COULD NOT HIDE THE TRUTH ENTIRELY
I LIKE SHORT PLAIN HOME-LIKE NAMES SUCH AS WILL NED OR TOM
MAUD ESTABLISHED HERSELF WITH GREAT SATISFACTION AND TOM OWNED THAT A SILK APRON WAS NICER THAN A FUZZY CUSHION
THEY ARE ALMONDS AND PEANUTS SO WE CAN CRACK THEM WITH OUR TEETH
SHUT THE BOOK AND COME AWAY CRIED TOM ENJOYING THIS BROADSIDE IMMENSELY BUT FEELING GUILTY AS WELL HE MIGHT
WHILE KATY WAVED HER APRON FROM THE NURSERY WINDOW CRYING AS THEY DROVE AWAY THE SAINTS BLESS YE MISS POLLY DEAR AND SIND YE THE BEST OF LUCKS BUT THE CROWNING JOKE OF ALL WAS TOM'S GOOD-BY FOR WHEN POLLY WAS FAIRLY SETTLED IN THE CAR THE LAST ALL ABOARD UTTERED AND THE TRAIN IN MOTION TOM SUDDENLY PRODUCED A KNOBBY LITTLE BUNDLE AND THRUSTING IT IN AT THE WINDOW WHILE HE HUNG ON IN SOME BREAKNECK FASHION SAID WITH A DROLL MIXTURE OF FUN AND FEELING IN HIS FACE IT S HORRID
BUT THERE WAS A SAD SORT OF QUIETUDE ABOUT HER A WISTFUL LOOK IN HER FADED EYES AS IF SHE WANTED SOMETHING WHICH MONEY COULD NOT BUY AND WHEN CHILDREN WERE NEAR SHE HOVERED ABOUT THEM EVIDENTLY LONGING TO CUDDLE AND CARESS THEM AS ONLY GRANDMOTHERS CAN
THE BLACK LACE MAUD HAS JUST TAKEN OFF THE GREEN ONE WILL DO TO EDGE THE VIOLET AND WITH YOUR NICE SILK MANTILLA YOU ARE COMPLETE DON'T YOU SEE I DON'T QUITE SEE IT YET BUT I HAVE FIRM FAITH THAT I SHALL IN TIME AND CONSIDER MY CALLING COSTUME FINISHED SAID FANNY GETTING MORE AND MORE INTERESTED AS SHE SAW HER CONDEMNED WARDROBE COMING OUT FRESH AGAIN UNDER POLLY'S MAGIC KNACK
BUT HE COULD NOT HELP A GLANCE NOW AND THEN AND AS POLLY'S FACE BRIGHTENED HIS OWN FELL
I WANT SOMETHING TO SEE AND FEEL AND LIVE BY DAY-BY-DAY AND I HOPE YOU LL BE ONE OF THE TRUE MINISTERS WHO CAN TEACH BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE HOW TO GET AND KEEP IT I HOPE I SHALL BE POLLY BUT YOU KNOW THEY SAY THAT IN FAMILIES IF THERE IS A BOY WHO CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE THEY MAKE A MINISTER OF HIM
HE D TIRE ME IF HE WAS LIKE A
WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK FAN DROPPED HER LETTERS TOOK POLLY BY THE SHOULDERS AND CRIED IN A TONE FULL OF ASTONISHMENT POLLY IS IT TOM POOR POLLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
WE HEARD THE FRONT-DOOR SHUT THEN A MURMUR OF VOICES AND THEN BETSEY'S HEAVY STEP COMING UP STAIRS
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU VE DONE FOR ME
TAKE ME DOWN POLLY AND SEE IF THEY DON'T CALL ME A SWEET CREATURE TOM LOOKED SO UNUTTERABLY RIDICULOUS AS HE TOSSED HIS CURLS AND PRANCED THAT POLLY WENT OFF INTO ANOTHER GALE OF MERRIMENT
WHAT'S THIS
WHOSE FACE IN SPITE OF MANY LINES AND THE GRAY HAIRS ABOVE IT WAS NEVER SOUR OR UNSYMPATHETIC WHEN CHILDREN'S EYES TURNED TOWARDS IT
I AGREE WITH YOU POLLY
IT S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS
TRIX TOLD BELLE SHE WAS GOING TO ASK YOU FOR THE DRESS AS YOU WOULD N'T CARE TO WEAR IT NOW
BUT SOME PREFER BREAKING A BUTTERFLY WHICH DO YOU LIKE BEST ASKED A PALE GIRL OF POLLY IN ONE OF THE MOMENTARY LULLS WHICH OCCURRED
BUT AS IF THE WORDS REMINDED HIM OF SOMETHING HE GAVE HER A KISS INSTEAD A PIECE OF FORBEARANCE WHICH ALMOST TOOK MAUD'S BREATH AWAY WITH SURPRISE AND GRATIFICATION
BUT I REALLY AM DYING OF CURIOSITY TO KNOW WHAT YOU DO DOWN THERE
PRETTIER THAN EVER BY JOVE THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN MERE PRETTINESS IN POLLY'S FACE THOUGH TOM HAD NOT LEARNED TO SEE IT YET
ANOTHER AWFUL PAUSE SEEMED IMPENDING BUT JUST AT THAT MOMENT A HORSEMAN CLATTERED BY WITH A SMILE AND A SALUTE WHICH CAUSED POLLY TO EXCLAIM OH THERE S TOM WITH A TONE AND A LOOK THAT SILENCED THE WORDS HOVERING ON SYDNEY'S LIPS AND CAUSED HIM TO HOLD OUT HIS HAND WITH A LOOK WHICH MADE POLLY'S HEART FLUTTER THEN AND ACHE WITH PITY FOR A GOOD WHILE AFTERWARD THOUGH HE ONLY SAID GOOD BY POLLY HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
AIN'T YOU NOW POLLY KNEW SHE WAS AND HELD HER PEACE THOUGH SHE LONGED TO SPEAK
SHE SAYS IT S SELFISH
BECAUSE HE IS ONE OF THE MEN WHO CAN BE LED BY THEIR AFFECTIONS AND THE WOMAN HE MARRIES CAN MAKE OR MAR HIM THAT S TRUE CRIED FAN AS POLLY PAUSED TO LOOK AT THE PICTURE WHICH APPEARED TO REGARD HER WITH A GRAVE STEADY LOOK WHICH SEEMED RATHER TO BELIE HER ASSERTIONS
I DON'T THINK THERE IS THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBILITY OF MISS POLLY'S BEING EITHER ADDED SYDNEY WITH A LOOK WHICH MADE IT EVIDENT THAT CONCEALMENT HAD NOT SERIOUSLY DAMAGED POLLY'S DAMASK CHEEK AS YET
HER HAND STOLE UP TO HIS CHEEK AND SHE LEANED HER OWN CONFIDINGLY AGAINST THE ROUGH COAT AS SHE SAID IN HER FRANK SIMPLE WAY TOM DEAR DON'T SAY THAT AS IF I WAS THE BEST GIRL IN THE WORLD
WE ARE YOUR DEBTORS AS WELL AS BELLE AND DEMAND THE PRIVILEGE OF PAYING UP
YES M
I DON'T CARE WHAT STORIES THEY TELL ABOUT YOU I M SURE YOU WON'T LEAD HIM INTO TROUBLE BUT KEEP HIM STRAIGHT FOR MY SAKE
HE MAY PULL THROUGH BUT I HAVE MY DOUBTS
TOM'S FACE BRIGHTENED AS HE TOOK IT AND AFTER AN INSPECTION WHICH AMUSED THE OTHERS VERY MUCH HE LOOKED UP SAYING WITH AN AIR OF RELIEF PLUMS ALL THROUGH
WE WERE LITTLE FOLKS TILL EIGHTEEN OR SO
I JUST WON'T THEN RETURNED TOM WITH THE NATURAL PERVERSITY OF HIS TRIBE
NOW RIP THAT DRESS FOR JENNY TO PUT IN ORDER AND I LL TOSS YOU UP A BONNET IN LESS THAN NO TIME SAID POLLY DETERMINED TO HAVE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY FOR SHE KNEW FAN'S FEELINGS HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL TRIED LATELY IN MANY WAYS
FAN SAYS TRIX ALWAYS ASKS WHEN SHE COMES HOME AFTER THE SUMMER EXCURSIONS HOW MANY BIRDS HAVE YOU BAGGED AS IF MEN WERE PARTRIDGES
WHILE POLLY FORGOT THEM BOTH WHEN THE MUSIC BEGAN AND LEFT THEM AMPLE TIME TO LOOK AT HER AND THINK ABOUT THEMSELVES
DON'T CRY NOR THINK NOR DO ANYTHING BUT REST
PERHAPS NOT FOR I HAVE A CONSCIENCE AND TASTE IS ECONOMY SOMETIMES
FOR THE FATES HAD EVIDENTLY DECREED AT CANDY WAS NOT TO PROSPER ON THIS UNPROPITIOUS NIGHT
MY DAY IS OVER I SHALL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN
POLLY SURVEYED THE DAINTY SHINING BOOT WITH THE SCALLOPED TOP THE JAUNTY HEEL AND THE DELICATE TOE THOUGHT HER FOOT DID LOOK VERY WELL IN IT AND AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE SAID SHE WOULD HAVE THEM
AND AS SOON AS WE GOT UP STAIRS PRODUCED THE ROPE PROVIDED FOR THE PURPOSE AND INVITED SALLY TO BE LOWERED
THE GIRLS WERE TOUCHED BY THE APPEAL
PRINK HALF AN HOUR AND PUT ON HER WAD ANSWERED THE IRREVERENT TOM WHOSE PREPARATIONS FOR SCHOOL CONSISTED IN FLINGING HIS CAP ON TO HIS HEAD AND STRAPPING UP SEVERAL BIG BOOKS THAT LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE SOMETIMES USED AS WEAPONS OF DEFENCE
SO THE SHORT JOURNEY CAME BLITHELY TO AN END AND IN THE TWILIGHT SHE SAW A GROUP OF LOVING FACES AT THE DOOR OF A HUMBLE LITTLE HOUSE WHICH WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY PALACE IN HER EYES FOR IT WAS HOME
I CAN GO AND SEE HER AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN IT I SHALL FIND IT OUT FANNY DROPPED HER FACE INTO HER HANDS WITH A LITTLE SHIVER AS SHE SAID THAT
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO I M SURE PUT IN MRS SHAW WHO QUITE BURNED TO BE KNOWN AS A JOINT PATRONESS WITH MRS DAVENPORT
BUT AS NO ONE CAME WE DECIDED ON SENDING TO INQUIRE WHAT IT MEANT
CHAPTER XVI
I NEVER WAS TILL I LOVED YOU MY DEAR AND I M NOT VERY BAD YET FOR I DON'T WEAR MY POSY NEXT MY HEART BUT WHERE I CAN SEE IT EVERY DAY AND SO NEVER FORGET FOR WHOM I AM WORKING
IT S A VERY NICE THING AND I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED ANNOUNCED MRS SHAW ROUSING FROM A SLIGHT DOZE
AND INSTEAD OF A LEISURELY COSY MEAL HAD TO HURRY AWAY UNCOMFORTABLY FOR EVERYTHING WENT WRONG EVEN TO THE COMING OFF OF BOTH BONNET STRINGS IN THE LAST DREADFUL SCRAMBLE
AND POLLY QUITE BLUSHED FOR HER FRIEND WHEN ON BEING ASKED WHAT FAMOUS FRENCHMAN FOUGHT IN OUR REVOLUTION SHE ANSWERED LAMARTINE INSTEAD OF LAFAYETTE
DO YOU THINK IT S SAFE CRIED POOR POLLY MAKING A COCKED HAT OF HER LITTLE BEAVER BY THRUSTING IT OUT OF THE HALF-OPEN WINDOW ON HER SIDE
IT WAS ALL SO NEW AND STRANGE I M AFRAID I SHOULD N'T HAVE STOOD IT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR NED
THAT ENGAGEMENT WAS SUCH A FARCE THAT SHE NEVER HAD MUCH FAITH IN IT SO SHE PUT HER LOVE AWAY IN A CORNER OF HER HEART AND TRIED TO FORGET IT HOPING IT WOULD EITHER DIE OR HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE
POLLY'S NEEDLE SNAPPED IN TWO BUT SHE DID NOT MIND IT AS SHE SAID WITH A LOOK THAT SILENCED EVEN SHARP-TONGUED TRIX I CAN'T HELP BELIEVING WHAT MY OWN EYES AND EARS HAVE SEEN AND HEARD
HOLD YOUR TONGUE
NOW PLEASE TELL ABOUT HER
NOW GO AND LET US HEAR NO MORE OF THIS FOLLY THEY WENT WITHOUT A WORD AND MR SHAW HEARD NO MORE OF THE AFFAIR
I AM JUST GOING TO MASS AND YOU SHALL SPEEDILY HAVE THE PRAYERS AS YOU HAVE NOW THE KINDEST LOVE OF YOUR OWN ANNE BOLEYN
IT WOULD BE SO MEAN
HER FIRST ANSWER PLEASED ME VERY MUCH FOR I DID NOT EXPECT IT AND NOTHING TOUCHES A FELLOW MORE THAN TO HAVE A WOMAN STAND BY HIM THROUGH THICK AND THIN SHE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE DONE IT FAN WAS RIGHT
THEY HAD A LIVELY TEA AND WERE GETTING ON FAMOUSLY AFTERWARD WHEN TWO LETTERS WERE BROUGHT FOR TOM WHO GLANCED AT ONE AND RETIRED RATHER PRECIPITATELY TO HIS DEN LEAVING MAUD CONSUMED WITH CURIOSITY AND THE OLDER GIRLS SLIGHTLY EXCITED FOR FAN THOUGHT SHE RECOGNIZED THE HANDWRITING ON ONE AND POLLY ON THE OTHER
GO AND BE GOOD TO HIM
POLLY I WISH YOU D LET ME CALL YOU MARIE SAID FANNY ONE DAY AS THEY WERE SHOPPING TOGETHER
THIS BIT OF SILVER-GRAY IS ALL I ASK HERE S ENOUGH FOR A KILLING BONNET AND THOSE FORGET-ME-NOTS ARE BOTH PRETTY AND APPROPRIATE YOU WRETCH BE STILL CRIED FANNY AS POLLY LOOKED UP AT HER WITH A WICKED LAUGH IN HER EYES
POLLY SOON LURED HER OUT AGAIN BY ASSURANCES THAT SHE WOULD N'T BE UTTERLY DESPOILED AND PROMISES TO TRY AND SOFTEN THE HARD HEARTS OF HER FATHER'S CREDITORS IF THE EAR-RINGS AND THE SMELLING-BOTTLE WERE ATTACHED
NOW WHAT WILL I DO POLLY SPRINKLED CRUMBS TO THE DOVES WHO CAME DAILY TO BE FED AND WHILE SHE WATCHED THE GLEAMING NECKS AND ROSY FEET SHE RACKED HER BRAIN TO DEVISE SOME UNUSUALLY DELIGHTFUL WAY OF ENJOYING HERSELF FOR SHE REALLY HAD BOTTLED UP HER SPIRITS SO LONG THEY WERE IN A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE EFFERVESCENCE
SHOULD N'T WONDER IF THAT BIT OF NONSENSE HAD KEPT ME ECONOMICAL HONEST AND HARD AT IT FOR I NEVER OPENED MY POCKET-BOOK THAT I DID N'T THINK OF YOU THAT S LOVELY TOM AND POLLY FOUND IT SO TOUCHING THAT SHE FELT FOR HER HANDKERCHIEF
I M TIRED OF EVWYTHING CAUSE MY TOYS ARE ALL BWOKEN AND MY DOLLS ARE ALL SICK BUT CLAWA MOANED MAUD GIVING A JERK TO THE PARIS DOLL WHICH SHE HELD UPSIDE DOWN BY ONE LEG IN THE MOST UNMATERNAL MANNER
BUT THE SUN WAS VISIBLE NOW SETTING BRIGHTLY BELOW THE CLOUDS
JUST LIE ON THE SOFA AND READ FAIRY STORIES OR THINK ABOUT NOTHING
FAN FEELS DREADFULLY
WE HAVE N'T MUCH MONEY FOR SUCH THINGS SHOULD N'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT IF WE HAD
THE GIRLS FOUND THIS MORE INTERESTING THAN GOSSIP PARTLY OWING TO ITS NOVELTY DOUBTLESS
THEY DID WORRY ME SO TALKING WHEN I WANTED TO HEAR SAID POLLY AS THEY ROLLED AWAY
MR SYDNEY HAD SEEN AND HEARD THE WHOLE THING
YOU QUITE FRIGHTEN ME IT S BAD ENOUGH TO LOVE SOME ONE WHO DON'T LOVE YOU BUT TO HAVE THEM TOLD OF IT IS PERFECTLY AWFUL
TOM'S SUCCESS COME PHILANDER LET US BE A MARCHING EVERY ONE HIS TRUE LOVE A SEARCHING WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE MOTTO FOR THIS CHAPTER BECAUSE INTIMIDATED BY THE THREATS DENUNCIATIONS AND COMPLAINTS SHOWERED UPON ME IN CONSEQUENCE OF TAKING THE LIBERTY TO END A CERTAIN STORY AS I LIKED I NOW YIELD TO THE AMIABLE DESIRE OF GIVING SATISFACTION AND AT THE RISK OF OUTRAGING ALL THE UNITIES INTEND TO PAIR OFF EVERYBODY I CAN LAY MY HANDS ON
MY ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT TRIX WILL BREAK OFF THE AFFAIR BEFORE SPRING
NOW PUT IN THE NUTS SHE SAID AT LAST
WHAT IS A WAD ASKED POLLY WHILE FANNY MARCHED UP WITHOUT DEIGNING ANY REPLY
BUT IT WAS NOT AND POLLY'S FUN COST MORE THAN THE PRICE OF GLOVES AND BONNET FOR HAVING NIBBLED AT FORBIDDEN FRUIT SHE HAD TO PAY THE PENALTY
IS N'T THAT GAY SAID ONE LIVELY DAMSEL WHO HAD JUST COME IN
THERE WAS A PERFECT BABEL OF TONGUES BUT OUT OF THE CONFUSION POLLY GATHERED SCRAPS OF FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE WHICH SOMEWHAT LESSENED HER RESPECT FOR THE DWELLERS IN HIGH PLACES
PICK IT UP MAUD I LL GET SOME MORE AND POLLY WHISKED OUT OF THE ROOM GLAD OF AN EXCUSE TO RUN AND TELL FAN WHO HAD JUST COME IN LEST HEARING THE NEWS IN PUBLIC SHE MIGHT BE STARTLED OUT OF THE WELL-BRED COMPOSURE WITH WHICH YOUNG LADIES ARE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE TIDINGS EVEN OF THE MOST VITAL IMPORTANCE
OTHERS MERELY DROPPED THEIR EYELIDS AND WENT BY WITHOUT SPEAKING WHILE A GOOD MANY IGNORED HER AS ENTIRELY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN INVISIBLE
NO WELL IT DID ME
SO THE GIRLS EACH OPENED A DRAWER AND TURNED OVER THE CONTENTS TILL THEY FOUND SOMETHING THEY WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT
IF THAT S ALL I DON'T THINK BANKRUPTING IS SO VERY BAD SAID MAUD TAKING A CHEERFUL VIEW OF THINGS
YOU KNOW I CAN'T BEAR ANYTHING LIKE CONTENTION
IT WAS NOT A LARGE ROOM AND TOM SEEMED TO FILL IT ENTIRELY
A LITTLE FARTHER ON POLLY PASSED A NEWLY ENGAGED COUPLE WHOM SHE KNEW WALKING ARM IN ARM FOR THE FIRST TIME BOTH WEARING THAT PROUD YET CONSCIOUS LOOK WHICH IS SO DELIGHTFUL TO BEHOLD UPON THE COUNTENANCES OF THESE TEMPORARILY GLORIFIED BEINGS
HE HAD N'T TIME TO SEND BY ME I CAME OFF IN SUCH A HURRY
ART MORALS POLITICS SOCIETY BOOKS RELIGION HOUSEKEEPING DRESS AND ECONOMY FOR THE MINDS AND TONGUES ROVED FROM SUBJECT TO SUBJECT WITH YOUTHFUL RAPIDITY AND SEEMED TO GET SOMETHING FROM THE DRYEST AND THE DULLEST
WHEN IT COMES TO BONNETS I AM USUALLY INSPIRED
WELL YOU OUGHT NOT TO AND YOU MISS LOTS OF PLEASANT TIMES
REMEMBER THAT AND DON'T VISIT THE SINS OF ONE BLOCKHEAD ON ALL THE REST OF MANKIND SAID TOM LAUGHING AT HER EARNESTNESS
THERE S PLENTY OF FOLKS TO PICK US UP IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
HIS FATHER ASKED HIM HOW HE WAS A DOZEN TIMES A DAY
SO POLLY TRIED TO CONSOLE HERSELF BY JUMPING ROPE IN THE BACK-YARD AND PLAYING TAG WITH MAUD IN THE DRYING-ROOM WHERE SHE LIKEWISE GAVE LESSONS IN NAS-GIM-NICS AS MAUD CALLED IT WHICH DID THAT LITTLE PERSON GOOD
I M AFRAID YOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED AS A GUIDE IF VARIOUS RUMORS I VE HEARD ARE TRUE SAID POLLY LOOKING UP AT HIM WITH A WISTFUL EXPRESSION THAT CAUSED HIS FACE TO ASSUME THE SOBRIETY OF AN OWL'S
AUNT VALUED IT VERY MUCH EVEN IN ITS TATTERED CONDITION AND KEPT IT A LONG WHILE AS A MEMORIAL OF HER DISTINGUISHED GUESTS
AND I WANT TO DWEDFULLY I VE FORGOTTEN HOW MAUDIE
I DO IT STILL MORE THAN I OUGHT BUT I TRY NOT TO AND IT GETS EASIER I FIND
THOMAS JR
MY DRESS WILL COST A HUNDRED POUNDS OR MORE AND IS VERY ELEGANT
THAT IS WHY I MADE HER LARGER THAN THE MISERABLE PINCHED-UP WOMAN OF OUR DAY
I ONLY WANT TO SHOW YOU A PRESENT I VE HAD AND ASK YOUR ADVICE ABOUT ACCEPTING IT WHY TOM YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN EXCLAIMED POLLY FORGETTING ALL ABOUT HERSELF AS SHE SAW HIS FACE WHEN HE ROSE AND TURNED TO MEET HER
I M AN OUTSIDER AND THEY ONLY ACCEPT ME ON FAN'S ACCOUNT
BUT HE SAID HE DID IT FOR HER GOOD
I SUPPOSE SISTERS ALWAYS ARE GRAND OF THEIR BROTHERS
I DON'T CARE IF THE OLD CHURCHES WERE BARE AND COLD AND THE SEATS HARD THERE WAS REAL PIETY IN THEM AND THE SINCERITY OF IT WAS FELT IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE
I SHOULD TEAR IT OUT ONLY I PROMISED TO KEEP MY DIARY AND I WANT TO TALK OVER THINGS THAT PUZZLE ME WITH MOTHER
THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ABSENCE ANSWERED POLLY
TOM FOUND OUT WHAT THE MATTER WAS AND SIDED WITH POLLY WHICH PROCEEDING LED TO SCRAPE NUMBER TWO
DON'T MAKE SUCH A NOISE MY HEAD ACHES DREADFULLY SAID FANNY FRETFULLY
BEING FOND OF MUSIC SHE IGNORANTLY SUPPOSED THAT EVERY ONE ELSE WENT FOR THAT ALONE AND WAS MUCH DISTURBED BY THE WHISPERING THAT WENT ON AMONG THE YOUNG PEOPLE ROUND HER
HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF ME BUT I ACT AS IF I WAS ASHAMED OF HIM
IN THAT MINUTE FANNY FELT WITH MINGLED JOY AND SELF-REPROACH WHAT A DAUGHTER MIGHT BE TO HER FATHER
SHE WAS DEEP IN HER RESEARCHES WHEN FAN CAME IN AND LOOKED OVER HER SHOULDER FEELING TOO CROSS WITH POLLY TO CHIDE MAUD
BUT HE DON'T STAY SO LONG
WELL I DON'T CARE IF MY DRESS IS N'T IMPORTED
MR SHAW KISSED POLLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN HIS DEAREST DAUGHTER
THIS BAG WAS MADE FOR MY SPECIAL COMFORT AND HUNG ON THE SOFA WHERE I LAY ALL THOSE WEARY DAYS
HOW PRETTY SHE LOOKS AND POLLY RETIRED BEHIND THE BIG GLASS AGAIN THINKING THE CHAT WAS BECOMING RATHER PERSONAL
I USED TO CROAK AND FRET DREADFULLY AND GET SO UNHAPPY I WAS N'T FIT FOR ANYTHING
HOW COULD I DO IT AND POLLY EYED THE NEW BOOTS REPROACHFULLY AS THEY STOOD IN THE FIRST POSITION AS IF READY FOR THE PARTY
SHE WAS ONLY SIXTEEN AND HE WAS PERFECTLY SPLENDID
FOR A WEEK ALL WENT WELL
I LL WRITE TO-NIGHT
SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW EASY IT WAS TO GET USED TO IT AS FANNY DID
MEN MUST RESPECT SUCH GIRLS AS THESE SHE THOUGHT
IT OFTEN SEEMS LIKE A VERY HARD AND DISMAL PLACE AND I CROAK OVER MY TRIALS LIKE AN UNGRATEFUL RAVEN CAN'T WE MAKE THE TRIALS LIGHTER FOR YOU THE VOICE THAT PUT THE QUESTION WAS SO VERY KIND THAT POLLY DARED NOT LOOK UP BECAUSE SHE KNEW WHAT THE EYES WERE SILENTLY SAYING
BUT WHEN I RAN TO TELL HIM HE SAID GO AWAY AND DON'T BOTHER AND JUST TOOK ME BY THE SHOULDERS AND PUT ME OUT
I M GLAD THOSE MEN ARE GONE
FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN FANNY'S FACE WAS FULL OF AGITATION AND SHE SPOKE FAST AND FRANKLY FOR SHE WAS TRYING TO BE GENEROUS AND FOUND IT VERY HARD
POLLY WAS N'T CRYING AND LAY SO STILL THAT TOM BEGAN TO THINK SHE MIGHT BE IN A FIT OR A FAINT AND BENT ANXIOUSLY DOWN TO INSPECT THE PATHETIC BUNCH
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SHE DOES WELL BETWEEN OURSELVES SAID TOM LOOKING A LITTLE SHEEPISH BUT ANXIOUS TO SET HIS MIND AT REST SHE NEVER WILL LET ME KISS HER ON HER CHEEK NOTHING BUT AN UNSATISFACTORY PECK AT HER LIPS
CHAPTER VII
SO I LIKE MR SYDNEY BEST BECAUSE HE WAS KIND TO ME WHAT A SHARP CHILD YOU ARE POLLY
PRESENTLY MADAM CAME SLOWLY IN AND SAT DOWN IN HER ARM-CHAIR SAYING THAT S A FINE OLD TUNE
WONDER HOW IT WOULD SEEM TO CALL HIM ARTHUR AND POLLY SAID IT UNDER HER BREATH WITH A LOOK OVER HER SHOULDER TO BE SURE NO ONE HEARD IT
I DON'T WONDER YOU LOOKED UPSET
BUT STILL I NEVER DREAMED OF HIS LOVING YOU AS MORE THAN A DEAR FRIEND HE DOES N'T SIGHED POLLY
BUT HE LIKED IT AND TRUDGED AWAY FOR ANOTHER WEEK'S WORK RESTED CHEERED AND STRENGTHENED BY THAT QUIET HAPPY DAY WITH POLLY FOR HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE IN HOME INFLUENCES AND THIS BROTHER AND SISTER LOVED ONE ANOTHER DEARLY AND WERE NOT ASHAMED TO OWN IT
I HEARD WILL TALKING ABOUT PUBLICS AND PRIVATES AND I MEANT TO ASK HIM BUT I FORGOT WHAT DID HE SAY I DON'T REMEMBER
I ONLY SAID WE HAD COLD CWEAM AT THE PARTY LAST NIGHT AND HE LAUGHED ICE-CREAM CHILD AND FANNY FOLLOWED TOM'S REPREHENSIBLE EXAMPLE
THEN THE OTHER DAY AS I TOOK A BIT OF HELIOTROPE OUT OF A VASE TO PUT IN MY BUTTON-HOLE I WHISKED A DROP OF WATER INTO HER FACE
BUT SHE DID N'T LET THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HERSELF AND FAN TROUBLE HER
FOR YOU KNOW AS SOON AS WE CAME TO GRIEF I OFFERED TO RELEASE TRIX FROM THE ENGAGEMENT AND SHE WOULD N'T LET ME CONTINUED TOM AS IF HAVING BEGUN THE SUBJECT HE WISHED TO EXPLAIN IT THOROUGHLY
DID SHE AND ALL THE LITTLE GIRLS LOOKED DEEPLY IMPRESSED TILL MAUD OBSERVED WITH A FUNNY IMITATION OF HER FATHER'S MANNER MY PAPA SAID IT WAS SCAN-DILL-US
INSIDE WERE THESE LINES WRITTEN IN A SPRAWLING HAND WITH VERY BLACK INK
WHERE IS SHE ASKED FAN WISHING TO VENT HER VEXATION ON HER FRIEND
THERE THAT S THE CHAP FOR ME
SHE HAS N'T BEEN QUITE AS KIND AS EVER
LESSONS THE FIRST FEW WEEKS WERE HARD ONES FOR POLLY HAD NOT YET OUTGROWN HER NATURAL SHYNESS AND GOING AMONG SO MANY STRANGERS CAUSED HER FREQUENT PANICS
SHE WORE SOME SORT OF A BLUE THING WITH A CONFOUNDED BIRD OF PARADISE IN IT THAT KEPT WHISKING INTO MY FACE EVERY TIME SHE TURNED HER HEAD MEN NEVER KNOW A PRETTY THING WHEN THEY SEE IT
USUALLY YOU KNOW I JUST GO TO MRS O'GRADY AND TELL HER WHAT I WANT
WHERE S FAN ASKED THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN STROLLING INTO HIS SISTER'S ROOM WHERE POLLY LAY ON THE SOFA TRYING TO FORGET HER TROUBLES IN AN INTERESTING BOOK
BUT SHE KEPT THEM ALL FINE OR FUNNY KNOWING THE CHILDREN AT HOME WOULD ENJOY ANYTHING NEW
CHAPTER XII
NO HARM IN TAKING A LOOK AT EM SAID TOM
THEY SOUND FLAT AND PROSY AFTER YOUR BRILLIANT ADVENTURES
BUT HE LL BE AS BAD AS EVER WHEN HE S WELL RETURNED FANNY WHO HAD N'T MUCH FAITH IN SICK-BED REPENTANCES
THEY BOTH SAT QUIET FOR A MINUTE POLLY IN THE BIG CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM WITH A NEW RESPECT IN HER EYES TOM ON THE STOOL NEAR BY SLOWLY TEARING UP A FOLDED PAPER HE HAD ABSENTLY TAKEN FROM THE FLOOR WHILE HE TALKED
AND I JUST WISH I HAD A BROTHER LIKE JIM CRIED FANNY FOR SHE FELT THE REPROACH IN TOM'S WORDS AND KNEW SHE DESERVED IT
BUT I FORGOT ALL ABOUT TO-DAY
I KNOW IT WAS N'T PROPER FOR LITTLE GIRLS TO SEE OR I SHOULD N'T HAVE BEEN SO ASHAMED CRIED STURDY POLLY PERPLEXED BUT NOT CONVINCED EVEN BY MRS SMYTHE PERKINS
YES HE LIVED THEN AND A FINE OLD FELLOW HE WAS TOO THERE
AND WAS IT NOT FOR THE ABUNDANCE OF FINE THINGS I AM EVERY DAY GETTING I SHOULD BE IMPATIENT OF RETURNING INTO THE COUNTRY
IT S SOMETHING HORRID I M SURE FOR WHEN PAPA CAME HOME HE WENT UP TO MAMMA'S ROOM AND TALKED EVER SO LONG AND MAMMA CRIED VERY LOUD AND WHEN I TRIED TO GO IN FAN WOULD N'T LET ME AND SHE LOOKED SCARED AND STRANGE
WHEN SHE GETS PALE AND DRAGGED OUT SHE WILL PROBABLY CHANGE HER MIND I DOUBT IT SAID TOM
YES I DO LIKE THAT BETTER AND I WISH I HAD BEEN IN THIS GIRL'S PLACE DON'T YOU POLLY SAID FAN AS GRANDMA TOOK OFF HER GLASSES
BUT I M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY SO CRIED POLLY MUCH TOUCHED
YOU LEFT IT ON THE FLOOR OF MY DEN THE NIGHT WE TALKED THERE AND I VE KEPT IT EVER SINCE
AND GRANDMA HELD HER CLOSE WHISPERING IN A TREMULOUS TONE MY LITTLE COMFORT COME AGAIN SOON
THE COASTERS WERE AT IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT AND SHE WATCHED THEM TILL HER LONGING TO JOIN THE FUN GREW IRRESISTIBLE
THE OTHERS DID N'T MIND ANYTHING ABOUT ME THEY THOUGHT YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL I SUPPOSE MY MOTHER SAYS A REAL GENTLEMAN IS AS POLITE TO A LITTLE GIRL AS TO A WOMAN
YOU HAPPY GIRL SIGHED POLLY THEN SMILED AND ADDED I THINK YOU DESERVE ALL THAT S COME TO YOU FOR YOU HAVE TRULY TRIED TO BE WORTHY OF IT AND WHETHER IT EVER CAME OR NOT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A THING TO BE PROUD OF HE SAYS THAT IS WHAT MADE HIM LOVE ME ANSWERED FANNY NEVER CALLING HER LOVER BY HIS NAME BUT MAKING THE LITTLE PERSONAL PRONOUN A VERY SWEET WORD BY THE TONE IN WHICH SHE UTTERED IT
I KNEW YOU D HURT YOURSELF WITH THAT HORRID THING JUST LET IT BE AND COME HOME FOR YOUR HEAD BLEEDS DREADFULLY AND EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT US WHISPERED POLLY TRYING TO TIE THE LITTLE HANDKERCHIEF OVER THE UGLY CUT
I KNOW WHO SHE MEANS CRIED MAUD ALWAYS EAGER TO FIND OUT THINGS
THE DRESS CAUGHT HIS EYE AND STOPPING TO ADMIRE THAT THE WEARER'S INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION INTERESTED HIS MIND AND IN TIME THE WOMAN'S SWEETNESS WON HIS HEART
AND DOWN THEY WENT WITH FLUTTERING HEARTS
NOT QUITE MODESTLY ANSWERED TOM
AND FINISHED OFF BY PINNING ON A BUNCH OF FALSE RINGLETS WHICH FANNY TRIED TO KEEP A PROFOUND SECRET
I WON'T DO THAT ANYWAY
SO YOU D BETTER LET ME ALONE FAN SAID TOM DRAWING OFF WITH A THREATENING WAG OF THE HEAD ADDING IN A DIFFERENT TONE I ONLY PUT THE SHELLS IN FOR FUN POLLY
THE WAY THEY GET SO MUCH DONE IS THEY TAKE WORK HOME AND MAKE THEIR SEAMSTRESSES DO IT AND THEN THEY TAKE CREDIT FOR VAST INDUSTRY SAID BELLE WHO ALWAYS SPOKE HER MIND WITH CHARMING CANDOR
YOU LL FIND HER EASY ENOUGH
BUT HER PAPA IS AN OLD POKE SO HE S SENT THEM ALL AWAY
THIS EXPLANATION WILL I TRUST RELIEVE THOSE WELL-REGULATED MINDS WHO CANNOT CONCEIVE OF SUCH LITERARY LAWLESSNESS FROM THE BEWILDERMENT WHICH THEY SUFFERED WHEN THE SAME EXPERIMENT WAS TRIED IN A FORMER BOOK
AND THAT IS FOR A COURSE OF LECTURES ON LITERATURE WHICH I LL KEEP FOR MYSELF AS KATE DEALT OUT THE COLORED CARDS TO THE GRATEFUL GIRLS FANNY TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT HER WONDERING IF THE TIME WOULD EVER COME WHEN WOMEN COULD EARN A LITTLE MONEY AND SUCCESS WITHOUT PAYING SUCH A HEAVY PRICE FOR THEM
THE FACT IS I LIKE TO MEET HIM I AM GLAD TO BE SEEN WITH HIM AND PUT ON AIRS I DARE SAY LIKE A VAIN GOOSE AS I AM
HE IS ALREADY A MILTON
PLEASE DON'T
AND IT HAD A GOOD EFFECT UPON MANNERS AND TEMPER MADE ROUGH AND BELLIGERENT BY CONSTANT SNUBBING AND OPPOSITION
THEN LIKE AN ANSWER CAME LITTLE JENNY'S WORDS NOW TAKING A NEW SIGNIFICANCE TO POLLY'S MIND TO BE STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL AND GO ROUND MAKING MUSIC ALL THE TIME YES SHE COULD DO THAT
HOW OLD AND BENT POOR FATHER DOES LOOK
I D LIKE TO FOR I HAVE N'T STUDIED A BIT SINCE I CAME
WHAT DOES HE KNOW OR CARE ABOUT MY AFFAIRS DEMANDED POLLY
YOU JUST PERCH ON THAT CRACKER-KEG AND I LL SEE THAT YOU GET ENOUGH SAID TOM PUTTING A DUMBWAITER BEFORE HER AND ISSUING HIS ORDERS WITH A FINE AIR OF AUTHORITY
SHE LL SPIN YOU ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM MR SYDNEY'S NAME IS DOWN FOR THAT ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AT HER FAN WITH A PRETTY LITTLE AIR OF IMPORTANCE
HAND EM ALONG AND TOM SMOOTHED HIS APRON WITH A CHEERFUL AIR
THEN HERE S ANOTHER WHICH MAY HAVE SOME WEIGHT WITH YOU ADDED POLLY SLYLY
BLESSINGS LIKE CURSES COME HOME TO ROOST FAN MINE COME HOME A GOOD DEAL BIGGER THAN THEY WENT ANSWERED FANNY LOOKING PLEASED THAT LITTLE FAVORS SHOULD BE SO FAITHFULLY REMEMBERED
WHEN THE CURLS HAD BEEN PUT ON WITH MUCH PRICKING OF FINGERS AND A BLUE RIBBON ADDED LA FAN HE SURVEYED HIMSELF WITH SATISFACTION AND CONSIDERED THE EFFECT SO FINE THAT HE WAS INSPIRED TO TRY A STILL GREATER METAMORPHOSIS
IT WAS SO FUNNY TO SEE YOU WORKING AWAY AND NEVER GUESSING WHO THE CAKE WAS FOR
ARE YOU LAUGHING AT POLLY'S PRIM WAYS FANNY HAD ASKED AS SHE SAW MR SYDNEY SMILE
WHEN HE D SPOKEN OF THIS GIRL SEVERAL TIMES THEY BOARD WITH HER MOTHER YOU KNOW I ASKED ABOUT HER QUITE CARELESSLY AND HE TOLD ME SHE WAS PRETTY GOOD AND WELL EDUCATED AND HE THOUGHT TOM WAS RATHER SMITTEN
IF IT WAS A FIRST OFFENCE I MIGHT HAVE GOT OFF
DON'T YOU LIKE IT POLLY WHISPERED TOM AS THEY WENT DOWN STAIRS TOGETHER
THE OLD SET WILL DROP ME AS WE DID THE MERTONS WHEN THEIR FATHER FAILED AND MY PROSPECTS AS WE SAY ARE QUITE RUINED I DON'T BELIEVE IT
I WISH MY FANNY WAS MORE LIKE HER HE OFTEN SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE WATCHED THE GIRLS WHILE THEY THOUGHT HIM DEEP IN POLITICS OR THE STATE OF THE MONEY MARKET
MRS SHAW WAS A NERVOUS FUSSY INVALID WHO WANTED SOMETHING EVERY FIVE MINUTES
GRANDMA SHOOK HER HEAD BUT IT PLEASED HER VERY MUCH TO BE ADMIRED FOR SHE HAD BEEN A BEAUTY IN HER DAY
WHAT DID YOU DO IT S A TRUE BILL THIS TIME
BUT YOU OUGHT TO DO IT BECAUSE IT S RIGHT AND NEVER MIND BEING PAID BEGAN POLLY TRYING TO BE MORAL BUT SECRETLY SYMPATHIZING HEARTILY WITH POOR TOM
OF COURSE NOT
OF COURSE NOT
IN REAL LIFE WE FELLOWS AIN'T SUCH BATS AS ALL THAT OBSERVED TOM WHO HAD DECIDED OPINIONS ON MANY SUBJECTS THAT HE KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT AND EXPRESSED THEM WITH GREAT CANDOR
THERE S NOTHING I LIKE BETTER THAN TO SHOVEL IN SUGAR AND SPICE AND MAKE NICE PLUMMY CAKE FOR PEOPLE
BUT I M NOT GOING WAS POLLY'S DETERMINED ANSWER
DO GET ALONG AND DON'T BOTHER ME CRIED TOM EXASPERATED AT THE INTERRUPTION
MY DEAR THAT BOY IS THE MOST DELUDED CREATURE YOU EVER SAW BEGAN FANNY AS SOON AS THE FRONT DOOR BANGED
IT WAS A SOBER TALK BUT NOT ALL SAD FOR MR SHAW FELT INEXPRESSIBLY COMFORTED BY HIS CHILDREN'S UNEXPECTED SYMPATHY AND THEY TRYING TO TAKE THE DOWNFALL CHEERFULLY FOR HIS SAKE FOUND IT EASIER TO BEAR THEMSELVES
HOW MAD SHE WILL BE
I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE MENTIONED THIS PERHAPS BUT I WANTED TO SHOW YOU ONE THING THAT WE GIRLS CAN DO
AS TOM PAUSED BREATHLESS AND POLLY CLAPPED HER HANDS ENTHUSIASTICALLY THE SOUND WAS LOUDLY ECHOED FROM BEHIND HIM
THIS TIME ALL WENT WELL
SO THE LITTLE HOUSE WAS NOT BARE BUT MADE PLEASANT TO THEIR EYES BY THESE WAIFS FROM THE WRECK BROUGHT THEM BY THE TIDE OF SYMPATHY AND GOOD-WILL WHICH SOON SET IN
WOUND UP THE WATCH THOUGH IT WAS N'T TIME
ONLY DO IT TO KEEP UP MY FRENCH
AS SHE WENT HURRYING ALONG WITH A BIG MUSIC BOOK IN ONE HAND AND A PAPER BAG OF ROLLS FOR TEA IN THE OTHER SHE SAW TOM AND TRIX COMING
I DON'T GET MORE TRIBULATION THAN IS GOOD FOR ME I FANCY AND WE ARE APT TO MAKE MISTAKES WHEN WE TRY TO DODGE TROUBLES OR PEOPLE ADDED SYDNEY IN A TONE THAT MADE POLLY COLOR UP TO HER FOREHEAD
IT WAS A MOST DELECTABLE CAKE WITH A NOSEGAY ATOP AND ROUND IT ON THE SNOWY FROSTING THERE RAN A PINK INSCRIPTION JUST AS IT HAD BEEN EVERY YEAR SINCE TOM COULD REMEMBER
HOPE IT IS COOLLY RETURNED TOM
MAUD PRANCED LIKE A SMALL PEACOCK AND FAN MADE A SPLENDID COURTESY AS EVERY ONE TURNED TO SURVEY THEM
DON'T SHUT YOUR EYES POLLY
BASE SLANDERS
