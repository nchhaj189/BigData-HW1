IT OCCUPIED A POSITION THROUGH WHICH IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT THE AXIS OF THE EARTH INDEFINITELY PROLONGED COULD EVER PASS
WHILE AS FOR DRINK AS LONG AS THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH PURE WATER A FROZEN SEA WOULD AFFORD THEM AN INEXHAUSTIBLE RESERVOIR
THE ASTRONOMER SEEMED PLEASED WITH THE PROPOSAL AND AT ONCE COMMENCED A VERBOSE AND SOMEWHAT CIRCUMLOCUTORY ADDRESS OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY PRESENTS THE MAIN FEATURES
AND WHAT I WONDER IS THE USE OF ALL THESE BIG FIGURES SAID BEN ZOOF TO HIS MASTER WHEN NEXT DAY THEY WERE ALONE TOGETHER
SILENT AND TEARFUL HE STOOD UPON AN ICE-BOUND ROCK STRAINING HIS EYES ACROSS THE BOUNDLESS VISTA OF THE MYSTERIOUS TERRITORY
WHILE THE RUSSIANS FELT THEMSELVES SIMPLY RELIANT ON THEIR MASTER AND AS LONG AS THEY WERE WITH HIM WERE CARELESS AS TO WHERE OR HOW THEY SPENT THEIR DAYS
ALTHOUGH HE PROFESSED HIMSELF INCOMPETENT TO PRONOUNCE A DECIDED OPINION LIEUTENANT PROCOPE MANIFESTLY INCLINED TO THE BELIEF THAT NO ALTERATION WOULD ENSUE IN THE RATE OF GALLIA'S VELOCITY
WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOUR DARLING MONTMARTRE THEN THE CAPTAIN HAD TOUCHED A TENDER CHORD
YOUR EXPERIENCE CONFIRMS THAT PROBABILITY
THE MOON SHOUTED THE ORDERLY AS THOUGH OVERJOYED AT ONCE AGAIN BEHOLDING WHAT THE POET HAS CALLED
THE BLACKBOARD WAS COVERED WITH ALGEBRAICAL SYMBOLS TRACED IN CHALK WHICH THEY WERE CAREFUL NOT TO OBLITERATE
HE HAD BROUGHT HIS TELESCOPE DOWN FROM THE OBSERVATORY INTO THE COMMON HALL AND THERE AT FREQUENT INTERVALS BY NIGHT AND BY DAY HE WOULD ENDEAVOR TO CONTINUE HIS OBSERVATIONS
IT WAS ON THE 12TH OF MAY THAT ROSETTE EXHIBITED THIS RESULT OF HIS LABORS TO SERVADAC THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT WHO VISITED HIS APARTMENT AND NATURALLY EXAMINED THE DRAWING WITH THE KEENEST INTEREST
OF A SHOCK THAT WOULD HURL THE COMET STRAIGHT ON TO THE EARTH TO WHICH IT WOULD BECOME ATTACHED A GREAT WART UPON HER FACE SAID BEN ZOOF LAUGHING
THE DISAPPOINTMENT WAS VERY GREAT
I HAVE COME TO-DAY TO ORDER THEM TO SETTLE THE PRICE AND TO-MORROW BEN ZOOF SHALL FETCH THE GOODS AWAY MERCIFUL HEAVENS THE JEW BEGAN TO WHINE
THE VOLCANO WAS EXTINGUISHED
BUT OUR CASE IS DESPERATE
THE HANSA OF COURSE WOULD SHARE A SIMILAR FATE
THE TWO LOW MASTS OF THE SCHOONER HAD BEEN ERECTED FIRMLY ON THE SHORE AND FORMED SUPPORTS FOR THE MONTGOLFIER WHICH HAD BEEN DULY COVERED WITH THE NETTING AND WAS READY AT ANY MOMENT TO BE INFLATED
THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS THE 1ST OF AUGUST OR ACCORDING TO ROSETTE THE 63RD OF APRIL
NO EVASIONS
NO DOUBT THE LIFE THE HEAT WE WANT IS RESERVED FOR US IN THE HEART AND BOWELS OF OUR OWN GALLIA WHILST THE CAPTAIN WAS INDULGING IN HIS EXPRESSIONS OF ENTHUSIASM PROCOPE WAS ENDEAVORING TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS
THAT POINT WAS REACHED ON THE 3RD OF MARCH AND THENCE THE COAST WAS CONTINUOUSLY FOLLOWED AS IT LED THROUGH WHAT HAD BEEN TUNIS ACROSS THE PROVINCE OF CONSTANTINE AWAY TO THE OASIS OF ZIBAN
WE ARE COMING TO SOMETHING EXCLAIMED SERVADAC
IS IT LAND DO YOU SUPPOSE INQUIRED SERVADAC EAGERLY
IT WAS VERY CERTAIN THAT THE YACHT WOULD HAVE FOUND A DIFFICULTY IN HOLDING HER OWN IN SUCH A SWELL
BUT--BUT YOUR EXCELLENCY STAMMERED OUT THE BEWILDERED MAN
WE HAVE ONLY A FRAGMENT OF A WORLD BUT IT CONTAINS NATIVES OF FRANCE RUSSIA ITALY SPAIN AND ENGLAND
HARD BY
IT ADJOINED AN OLD STONE HOSTELRY PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED BY A DETACHMENT OF ENGINEERS AND WHICH NOW AFFORDED SHELTER FOR BEN ZOOF AND THE TWO HORSES
A NEW CARGO HAD BEEN TAKEN IN ONLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE AND IT HAD BEEN ISAAC HAKKABUT'S INTENTION TO CRUISE FROM CEUTA TO TRIPOLI CALLING WHEREVER HE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THERE WAS LIKELY TO BE A MARKET FOR ANY OF HIS COMMODITIES
ANYHOW THE STRICTEST ECONOMY WAS NECESSARY AND IT WAS ACCORDINGLY RESOLVED THAT THE VOYAGE SHOULD NOT BE MUCH PROLONGED
BUT IT DOES NOT ANSWER TO THROW A CHANCE AWAY FOR GIVING BATTLE TO THOSE THIEVES OF BIRDS LEAVING LITTLE NINA AND HER GOAT IN THE GOURBI SERVADAC COUNT TIMASCHEFF AND THE LIEUTENANT GREATLY MYSTIFIED TOOK UP THEIR GUNS AND FOLLOWED THE ORDERLY
FAR BETTER THAN WITH OURSELVES WAS THE SENTIMENT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED IN NINA'S HIVE
IT IS ALL IN FRENCH EXCEPT A FEW SCATTERED WORDS OF ENGLISH LATIN AND ITALIAN INSERTED TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
BECAUSE I THINK PERHAPS--I AM NOT QUITE SURE--PERHAPS THE STEELYARD IS NOT QUITE CORRECT THE WORDS WERE NOT UTTERED BEFORE THE PROFESSOR FIERCE AS A TIGER HAD RUSHED AT THE JEW HAD SEIZED HIM BY THE THROAT AND WAS SHAKING HIM TILL HE WAS BLACK IN THE FACE
YET HOUR BY HOUR THE SUN'S DISC WAS LESSENING IN ITS DIMENSIONS AND ALTHOUGH AT MIDDAY SOME FAINT RADIANCE AND GLOW WERE TO BE DISTINGUISHED DURING THE NIGHT THE PAINFULNESS OF THE COLD WAS BECOMING ALMOST INTOLERABLE
YOU KNOW GENTLEMEN THAT THIS BLOCK IS A CUBE HEWN FROM THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH EVERYWHERE ALL THROUGHOUT YOUR VOYAGE OF CIRCUMNAVIGATION YOU FOUND GALLIA TO BE COMPOSED--A SUBSTANCE TO WHICH YOUR GEOLOGICAL ATTAINMENTS DID NOT SUFFICE TO ASSIGN A NAME OUR CURIOSITY WILL BE GRATIFIED SAID SERVADAC IF YOU WILL ENLIGHTEN OUR IGNORANCE BUT ROSETTE DID NOT TAKE THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE OF THE INTERRUPTION
THE SOLIDITY OF THE ICE WAS PERFECT
YOU HARDLY FIND THEM IN NOVELS
AND ENGAGING A MATE WITH A CREW OF THREE MEN AS BEING ADEQUATE TO WORK SO LIGHT A CRAFT HE CRUISED ALONG THE COASTS OF ALGERIA TUNIS EGYPT TURKEY AND GREECE VISITING MOREOVER MOST OF THE HARBORS OF THE LEVANT
HIS CIRCUMFERENCE IS ABOUT 220,000 MILES
HE AVOWED OVER AND OVER AGAIN HIS INTENTION OF NEVER QUITTING THE NUCLEUS OF HIS COMET
THEY WOULD NOT CARE
BUT WHAT OF THAT LET US BE PHILOSOPHERS AND WAIT PATIENTLY UNTIL WE CAN HEAR THEIR EXPLANATION SERVADAC SMILED
HE HAD SOUGHT IN VAIN FOR FURTHER TRACE OF THE HUGE DISC THAT HAD SO EXCITED HIS WONDER ON THE 1ST AND IT SEEMED MOST PROBABLE THAT IN ITS IRREGULAR ORBIT IT HAD BEEN CARRIED BEYOND THE RANGE OF VISION
ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING SERVADAC AND BEN ZOOF TRAVERSED ONE OF THE MOUNTAIN GORGES
THE IDEA OF BETAKING THEMSELVES TO THE DOBRYNA AND HANSA COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT BE SERIOUSLY ENTERTAINED
COLOPHON OMITTED F
I WANT TO SPEAK TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR IS IN BED AND ASLEEP I CAN WAIT UNTIL HE AWAKES THEN WAIT WHERE YOU ARE AND WITH THIS INHOSPITABLE REJOINDER THE ORDERLY WAS ABOUT TO RETURN TO HIS PLACE AT THE SIDE OF HIS PATIENT WHEN SERVADAC WHO HAD BEEN ROUSED BY THE SOUND OF VOICES CALLED OUT WHAT'S THE MATTER BEN ZOOF OH NOTHING SIR
I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY AND TURNING CONTEMPTUOUSLY ON HIS HEEL SERVADAC LEFT THE OLD MAN VOCIFERATING BITTERLY AND WITH UPLIFTED HANDS PROTESTING VEHEMENTLY AGAINST THE RAPACITY OF THE GENTILES
I MUST HAVE A MEASURE AND I MUST HAVE A KILOGRAMME I HAVE NEITHER OF THEM ANSWERED ISAAC
WE MUST HAVE TEN KILOGRAMMES OF EACH
BUT LIKE THE TWO AMERICAN CLUBS THAT PLAYED THEIR CELEBRATED GAME IN 1846 BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND BALTIMORE THE TWO GALLANT OFFICERS MADE USE OF THE SEMAPHORE TO COMMUNICATE THEIR WELL-DIGESTED MOVES
HERE AND THERE A SLIGHT LAYER OF SNOW OR A THIN COATING OF ICE ARISING FROM ATMOSPHERIC CONDENSATION INDICATED THE EXISTENCE OF SUPERFICIAL MOISTURE BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE A PERIOD INDEFINITELY LONG EXCEEDING HUMAN RECKONING BEFORE THAT MOISTURE COULD COLLECT INTO A STREAM AND ROLL DOWNWARDS OVER THE STONY STRATA TO THE SEA
THE CROPS HAD RIPENED RAPIDLY DURING THE EXCESSIVE HEAT OF JANUARY WHEN THE ORBIT OF GALLIA WAS BEING TRAVERSED AT ITS PERIHELION AND WERE NOW EXPOSED TO THE DEPREDATIONS OF MANY THOUSANDS OF BIRDS
AS FOR ISAAC HAKKABUT HIS OUTCRY WAS BEYOND DESCRIPTION LAMENTABLE
HE ONLY CLIMBED UP TO HIS TELESCOPE LOOKING HAGGARD AND DISTRESSED AND WHEN COMPELLED BY THE FROST TO RETIRE HE WOULD MAKE HIS WAY BACK TO HIS STUDY MORE FURIOUS THAN EVER
EXCLAMATIONS OF SURPRISE AND HORROR BURST FROM EVERY LIP
JUST 292 TIMES LESS THAN THAT OF THE EARTH PRETTY LITTLE COMET
RUSSIA A GIGANTIC POLAR BEAR STOOD WITH ITS HEAD TOWARDS ASIA ITS LEFT PAW RESTING UPON TURKEY ITS RIGHT UPON MOUNT CAUCASUS
HE IS WORN OUT
THE CAR WAS CLOSE AT HAND
WHAT HOWEVER SEEMED MOST REMARKABLE WAS THE MANIFEST EVIDENCE THAT EVER SINCE THE HIGHEST FLOOD WHICH WAS CAUSED IN ALL PROBABILITY BY THE PROXIMITY OF THE BODY OF WHICH THE HUGE DISC HAD BEEN SO CONSPICUOUS ON THE NIGHT OF THE 31ST OF DECEMBER THE PHENOMENON HAD BEEN GRADUALLY LESSENING AND IN FACT WAS NOW REDUCED TO THE NORMAL LIMITS WHICH HAD CHARACTERIZED IT BEFORE THE CONVULSION
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HIS FEATURES BECAME CONTRACTED HIS FACE FLUSHED WITH APPARENT IRRITATION AND HE EXCLAIMED FRETFULLY MY SPECTACLES!--WHERE ARE MY SPECTACLES IN ORDER TO FACILITATE HIS OPERATIONS BEN ZOOF HAD REMOVED THE SPECTACLES IN SPITE OF THE TENACITY WITH WHICH THEY SEEMED TO ADHERE TO THE TEMPLES OF HIS PATIENT
STILL NO SHIP APPEARED
BUT THE SEA WAS DESERTED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THE CAPTAIN NOTICED THAT ALTHOUGH THE WIND WAS CALM THE WATERS WERE UNUSUALLY AGITATED AND SEETHED AND FOAMED AS THOUGH THEY WERE BOILING
IN THEIR PERIHELIA THEY CANNOT APPROXIMATE THE SUN AS WE HAVE DONE
WELL I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THEY THINK OF ALL THIS AT MOSTAGANEM SAID THE CAPTAIN
SERVADAC'S HEART BOUNDED AS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FRAGMENT OF BLUE CANVAS FLUTTERING IN THE WIND FROM THE TOP OF THE PYLONE
BUT AT THE VERY FIRST ARRIVAL OF SUMMER THEY WOULD BE BOUND TO ARRANGE FOR THE DOBRYNA AND THE HANSA TO RETRANSPORT THEMSELVES AND ALL THEIR ANIMALS TO THE SHORES OF GOURBI ISLAND WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMMENCE THEIR AGRICULTURAL LABORS TO SECURE THE CROPS THAT MUST FORM THEIR WINTER STORE
THIS SPRING-TIME IF SUCH IT MAY BE CALLED HAD A MOST ENLIVENING INFLUENCE UPON ALL
A LATH WAS THEN CUT OF THIS EXACT LENGTH AND GIVEN TO THE ENGINEER OF THE DOBRYNA WHO WAS DIRECTED TO CUT OUT OF THE SOLID ROCK THE CUBIC DECIMETER REQUIRED BY THE PROFESSOR
WHO GOES THERE FRIENDS
JUPITER THE COLOSSAL PLANET GRAVITATING AT A DISTANCE OF 475,693,000 MILES MAY BE RECKONED AS 70,000,000 CENTURIES OLD
ONLY IT AMUSES ME TO SEE HOW YOU WANT TO REVISE THE TERRESTRIAL CALENDAR I WANT TO BE LOGICAL THAT'S ALL BY ALL MANNER OF MEANS MY DEAR PROFESSOR LET US BE LOGICAL WELL THEN LISTEN TO ME RESUMED THE PROFESSOR STIFFLY
HE FELT THAT HIS JUDGMENT WAS UTTERLY BAFFLED
NO MORE HAVE I SAID THE BOY I USED TO RUN ALONG BY THE SIDE OF THE DILIGENCES WHEN I WAS IN SPAIN I USED TO LOOK AFTER GOATS AT MADALENA SAID NINA
WHERE WAS HIS BELOVED FRANCE
SO THAT FOR THE GOVERNOR AND HIS POPULATION WITH THEIR TWO HORSES NOT ONLY WAS THERE AMPLE PROVISION BUT EVEN IF OTHER HUMAN INHABITANTS BESIDES THEMSELVES SHOULD YET BE DISCOVERED THERE WAS NOT THE REMOTEST PROSPECT OF ANY OF THEM PERISHING BY STARVATION
BUT I WOULD GIVE YOU A FEW REALS IF YOU WOULD LET ME TALK TO THIS STRANGER BUT AS IF HE THOUGHT HE WAS MAKING TOO LIBERAL AN OFFER HE ADDED ONLY IT MUST BE AT ONCE HE IS TOO TIRED
CONSEQUENTLY AS THE MEN EXPRESSED IT THEY WERE IN THIS RESPECT ALL RIGHT OF COURSE THE PHYSICAL CHANGES THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE HAD ATTRACTED THE NOTICE BOTH OF OFFICERS AND MEN
SUCH BEING HIS TEMPERAMENT IT MAY WELL BE IMAGINED THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS NOT TO REMAIN LONG IN IGNORANCE OF THE CAUSE OF THE PHENOMENA WHICH HAD BEEN SO STARTLING IN THEIR CONSEQUENCES
ACCORDINGLY THE HEAD OF THE DOBRYNA WAS POINTED NORTH MAKING STRAIGHT AS IT WAS PRESUMED FOR THE SOUTH OF EUROPE
NOW LOOK SHARP HAKKABUT HEREUPON DESCENDED INTO THE HOLD OF THE TARTAN AND SOON RETURNED CARRYING TEN PACKETS OF TOBACCO EACH WEIGHING ONE KILOGRAMME AND SECURELY FASTENED BY STRIPS OF PAPER LABELED WITH THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT STAMP
THE TRUTH WAS THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS JUST AS SENSITIVE ABOUT HIS COMET AS THE ORDERLY WAS ABOUT MONTMARTRE AND IF THE CONTENTION BETWEEN THE TWO HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO GO ON UNCHECKED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT SERIOUS QUARREL MIGHT NOT HAVE ARISEN
IT MUST BE OWNED THAT THE REVISED CALENDAR WAS LEFT TO THE PROFESSOR'S SOLE USE AND THE COLONY WAS FAIRLY PUZZLED WHENEVER HE REFERRED TO SUCH UNHEARD-OF DATES AS THE 47TH OF APRIL OR THE 118TH OF MAY
ITS RACE-COURSE COULD WELL HOLD ITS OWN AGAINST THAT AT PENTELIQUE
THE SECOND TAKES 3 DAYS 13 HOURS 14 MINUTES
AND DID IT NOT GIVE IN ITS SAD AND TOO CONVINCING TESTIMONY THAT ANTIBES ITSELF HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THE GREAT DESTRUCTION
ON ONE OCCASION BEN ZOOF ENDEAVORED TO MITIGATE HIS MASTER'S IMPATIENCE BY EXHORTING HIM TO ASSUME THE RESIGNATION EVEN IF HE DID NOT FEEL THE INDIFFERENCE WHICH HE HIMSELF EXPERIENCED
THE TRANSIT FROM THE VOLCANO TO THE ISLAND WAS NOT LONG AND WAS MARKED BY ONLY ONE NOTICEABLE INCIDENT
LAUGH CAPTAIN IF YOU LIKE
AT YOUR SERVICE SIR REPLIED BEN ZOOF WITH IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY
THEIR HEARTS THEIR HOPES WERE SET UPON THEIR NATURAL HOME
SOME YEARS LATER COLONEL NO LONGER CAPTAIN SERVADAC HIS HAIR SLIGHTLY STREAKED WITH GREY HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THE HANDSOME YOUNG SPANIARD UNITED IN MARRIAGE TO THE ITALIAN NOW GROWN INTO A CHARMING GIRL UPON WHOM THE COUNT BESTOWED AN AMPLE DOWRY
THIS WAS ENOUGH HOWEVER TO INDICATE THAT THE SHIP WAS A SCHOONER--AN IMPRESSION THAT WAS CONFIRMED WHEN TWO HOURS LATER SHE CAME ENTIRELY IN SIGHT
THE CURTAIN OF FIRE EXTENDING OVER THE OPENING OF THE CAVERN PROVIDED IT AS ALREADY STATED WITH LIGHT AND HEAT
AND THEN LOOKING DOWN TO THE ROCK UPON WHICH THEY WERE STANDING HE ADDED WE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN TRANSPLANTED TO A SOIL STRANGE ENOUGH IN ITS CHEMICAL CHARACTER TO BEWILDER THE SAVANTS AT A MUSEUM AND DO YOU OBSERVE CAPTAIN ASKED THE COUNT HOW THE CONVEXITY OF OUR LITTLE WORLD CURTAILS OUR VIEW
BUT AT PRESENT HIS BUSINESS WAS TO PROSECUTE HIS LABORS SO THAT A RETREAT MIGHT BE IMMEDIATELY EFFECTED FROM THEIR NOW UNTENABLE POSITION
BUT WITH THE GOOD PROSPECT BEFORE THEM OF ONCE AGAIN STANDING ON TERRESTRIAL SHORES THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO AT PRESENT EXCEPT TO MAKE THEMSELVES AS COMFORTABLE AS THEY COULD IN THEIR PRESENT QUARTERS
ON THE 18TH ROSETTE WAS OVERHEARD IN FURIOUS ALTERCATION WITH BEN ZOOF
YES ANSWERED PROCOPE
THE CHILD'S EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
THE PROFESSOR WAS IN THE WORST OF TEMPERS
THESE DIRE FOREBODINGS HOWEVER WERE NOT DESTINED TO BE REALIZED
THAT'S RIGHT SAID THE ASTRONOMER WITH FUSSY IMPORTANCE
BEN ZOOF KNEW WHAT HIS MASTER MEANT AND TO HIM HIS MASTER'S WISH WAS LAW
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE RIGHT WHILE THIS DISCUSSION HAD BEEN GOING ON THE SATELLITE OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE HAD BEEN RISING STEADILY ABOVE THE HORIZON AND HAD REACHED A POSITION FAVORABLE FOR OBSERVATION
OUR NEXT DISCOVERY CONTINUED THE COUNT WAS THAT A NEW COAST HAD BEEN UPHEAVED RIGHT ALONG IN FRONT OF THE COAST OF TRIPOLI THE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION OF WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER STRANGE AND WHICH EXTENDED TO THE NORTH AS FAR AS THE PROPER PLACE OF MALTA AND MALTA CRIED SERVADAC UNABLE TO CONTROL HIMSELF ANY LONGER
THE ORDERLY PERFORMED HIS CULINARY OPERATIONS IN THE ADJOINING BUILDING WHICH HE ALSO USED AS A BED-ROOM AND WHERE EXTENDED ON WHAT HE CALLED HIS GOOD OAK MATTRESS HE WOULD SLEEP SOUNDLY AS A DORMOUSE FOR TWELVE HOURS AT A STRETCH
AND THE BITS OF THE EARTH WHICH YOU HAVE NAMED WERE CARRIED CLEAN AWAY THEY WERE ALL FAIRLY BEWILDERED
WE WERE QUITE AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHERE WE SHOULD STEER BUT DECIDED TO DIRECT OUR COURSE TO WHAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN THE EAST IN ORDER THAT WE MIGHT IF POSSIBLE DISCOVER THE COLONY OF ALGERIA
MANIFESTLY HE HAD ARRIVED AT SOME KNOWLEDGE OF GALLIA'S MOVEMENTS
WE MUST DO NOTHING RASH
YES OF FRANCE
THE EXTREME NAKEDNESS OF THE ENTIRE TRACT WAS LIKEWISE VERY EXTRAORDINARY
ASTRONOMERS IN THEIR INGENUITY HAVE ENDEAVORED TO USE SOME OTHER BASIS AND HAVE FOUND THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT TO BE CONVENIENT FOR THEIR PURPOSE
TURN THEIR COURSE IN WHATEVER DIRECTION THEY WOULD THEY FOUND THAT THE COUNTRY RETAINED EVERYWHERE ITS DESERT CHARACTER ROCKY BARREN AND WITHOUT A TRACE OF VEGETATION
WAS IT THE REVERBERATION OF THE CANNON STILL BOOMING IN THEIR EARS
THEY WERE FAR TOO STEEP AND TOO SLIPPERY TO AFFORD A FOOTHOLD
THE COURSE OF THE DOBRYNA WAS THEREFORE UNIMPEDED BY ICE BUT IT COULD NOT BE CONCEALED THAT THERE WAS THE GREATEST NECESSITY TO MAINTAIN THE UTMOST POSSIBLE SPEED
OH CRIED BEN ZOOF
YES THEY SHOULD HAVE THESE TOO FOR PROMISSORY NOTES
AND WHEN ISAAC UNDAUNTED BY HIS JEERS PERSEVERED IN BESETTING HIM WITH QUESTIONS HE TRIED TO SILENCE HIM BY SAYING ONLY WAIT TILL THE GOVERNOR GENERAL COMES
FROM LIVING THE LIFE OF RABBITS IN A WARREN THEY WERE REDUCED TO THE EXISTENCE OF MOLES WITH THE DIFFERENCE THAT THEY COULD NOT LIKE THEM FORGET THEIR TROUBLES IN A LONG WINTER'S SLEEP
THE VOLCANO HE CRIED
AND WHAT DO YOU SAY IS YOUR SURMISE AS TO YOUR PRESENT POSITION HE ASKED
HE HAD THEREFORE REASON TO HOPE THAT A DESCENT WOULD BE FOUND PRACTICABLE
VARIOUS INDENTATIONS IN THE OUTLINE OF ITS CRESCENT SHOWED THAT THE SOLAR BEAMS WERE REFRACTED INTO REGIONS OF ITS SURFACE WHERE THE SUN HAD ALREADY SET AND PROVED BEYOND A DOUBT THAT THE PLANET HAD AN ATMOSPHERE OF HER OWN
THE FROST NO DOUBT WILL DRIVE THE OLD FOX OUT OF HIS HOLE TOWARDS EVENING THE POTS WERE SET BOILING AND A BOUNTIFUL SUPPER TO WHICH ALL WERE INVITED WAS SPREAD IN THE CENTRAL HALL
BUT WHETHER THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH HAD FARED SO FORTUNATELY WAS A QUESTION THAT HAD STILL TO BE DETERMINED
WELL THEN SAID SERVADAC IF YOU DO NOT LIKE TO LEND US YOUR STEELYARD DO YOU OBJECT TO SELL IT TO US ISAAC FAIRLY SHRIEKED ALOUD
CEUTA WHICH HAD JUST BEEN LEFT BY THE SPANIARDS
RUSSIA
BEN ZOOF GIGGLED HEARTILY AS HE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED IT WAS ASTONISHING HOW THEY RECONCILED THEMSELVES TO HIS ABSENCE THE TIME CAME HOWEVER WHEN VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES PROMPTED HIM TO THINK HE MUST RENEW HIS INTERCOURSE WITH THE INHABITANTS OF THE HIVE
HE WAS AGITATED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE HAD HITHERTO BEEN UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS STRANGE EXPERIENCES BY ANY REASONABLE THEORY
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE HAD BROUGHT IN HIS HAND A MERCURIAL THERMOMETER AND SERVADAC CARRIED AN ANEROID BAROMETER BY MEANS OF WHICH HE COULD ESTIMATE THE DEPTH OF THEIR DESCENT BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE GALLIAN SEA
IN MASS HE IS ONLY 90 TIMES GREATER THAN THE EARTH WHICH GIVES HIM A DENSITY LESS THAN THAT OF WATER
HORNE PH.D
THE MERCURIAL THERMOMETER WHICH FREEZES AT 42 DEGREES BELOW ZERO WAS NO LONGER OF SERVICE AND THE SPIRIT THERMOMETER OF THE DOBRYNA HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO USE
NOT A SINGLE FRESH DISCOVERY REWARDED HIS SUFFERINGS
THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE NEW YEAR FETE WERE ENTRUSTED TO HIM AND HE WAS ANXIOUS IN SPITE OF THE RESOURCES OF GALLIA BEING SO LIMITED TO MAKE THE PROGRAM FOR THE GREAT DAY AS ATTRACTIVE AS POSSIBLE
BUT HOW MUCH DO YOU AGREE TO GIVE ME FOR THE HIRE--THE HIRE ONE DAY YOU SHALL HAVE TWENTY FRANCS SAID SERVADAC
TWO YEARS IN THE 3RD LIGHT CAVALRY
ARE WE NOT CONSIDERABLY TO THE WEST OF FORMENTERA ASKED SERVADAC AFTER EXAMINING THE CHART
BUT AT LENGTH A LITTLE NOOK WAS FOUND IN THE SIDE OF THE CAVERN JUST LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD AN ARMCHAIR AND A TABLE AND IN THIS THE ASTRONOMER WAS SOON ENSCONCED TO HIS ENTIRE SATISFACTION
IT MUST BE OWNED THAT THE CAPTAIN'S SLUMBERS WERE BY NO MEANS SOUND
DON'T YOU RECOLLECT CAPTAIN SERVADAC APPLIED HIMSELF TO HIS TASK WHILE THE BY-STANDERS WAITED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY SUPPRESSING THEIR INCLINATION TO LAUGH
ANXIOUS TO PACIFY HIM SERVADAC ASSURED HIM THAT EVERY EXERTION SHOULD BE MADE TO PROCURE THE INSTRUMENT AND DIRECTED BEN ZOOF TO GO TO THE JEW AND BORROW IT
THE SHIP COULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN BETTER HANDS
THE LENGTH OF THE NARROW STRAIT BY WHICH THEY HAD MADE THEIR WAY ACROSS THAT LAND TO REGAIN THE OPEN SEA WAS ABOUT THREE MILES AND A HALF
HITHERTO NOT ONE OF THEM WAS MISSING
WHERE WOULD BE THE USE OF OUR TRAVELING 200,000,000 LEAGUES FROM THE SUN IF WE ARE ONLY TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS WE SHOULD FIND AT THE POLES OF THE EARTH FORTUNATELY FOR US HOWEVER PROFESSOR SAID THE LIEUTENANT WITH A SMILE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE REMOTEST SPACE NEVER DESCENDS BEYOND 70 DEGREES BELOW ZERO AND AS LONG AS THERE IS NO WIND ADDED SERVADAC WE MAY PASS COMFORTABLY THROUGH THE WINTER WITHOUT A SINGLE ATTACK OF CATARRH LIEUTENANT PROCOPE PROCEEDED TO IMPART TO THE COUNT HIS ANXIETY ABOUT THE SITUATION OF HIS YACHT
AND MUCH AS LIEUTENANT PROCOPE FROM NAUTICAL CONSIDERATIONS MIGHT REGRET THE ABSENCE OF THE MOON HE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN OWN THAT THE MAGNIFICENT NIGHTS OF GALLIA WERE SUCH AS MUST AWAKEN THE ENTHUSIASM OF AN ASTRONOMER
ELSEWHERE IN VARIOUS QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE THERE MAY BE STERILE ROCKS BUT THERE ARE NONE SO ADAMANT AS TO BE ALTOGETHER UNFURROWED BY THE FILAMENTS ENGENDERED IN THE MOIST RESIDUUM OF THE CONDENSED VAPOR
I DARE SAY THAT A SLEDGE OF SOME SORT COULD BE CONTRIVED SAID THE COUNT
A THOUGHTFUL SILENCE FELL UPON THEM ALL WHICH SERVADAC WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK
MANY AND VARIOUS WERE THE CONJECTURES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DELAY
NOTHING HOWEVER WAS ALLOWED TO DIVERT THEM FROM THEIR OSTENSIBLE OBJECT OF MAKING A SURVEY OF THE COAST OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ACCORDINGLY THEY PERSEVERED IN FOLLOWING THAT SINGULAR BOUNDARY WHICH HAD REVEALED ITSELF TO THEIR EXTREME ASTONISHMENT
THEIR EXERTIONS WERE HAPPILY REWARDED
FOR IN POINT OF FACT THE ASTRONOMER WAS NONE OTHER THAN PROFESSOR PALMYRIN ROSETTE SERVADAC'S OLD SCIENCE-MASTER AT THE LYCEE CHARLEMAGNE
THE COAST MAKING A WIDE SWEEP ROUND TO THE FORMER POSITION OF CALABRIA AND JUTTING FAR BEYOND THE OUTLINE OF THE BOOT WHICH ITALY RESEMBLES
BUT WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING HE ADDED SERIOUSLY OF ALL THIS DISPLACEMENT OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES WHAT IS THAT GREAT BUILDING AT PARIS CAPTAIN WITH A TOP LIKE A CAP ASKED BEN ZOOF
HE WAS MAKING SOME EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PER CENT
CAPTAIN SERVADAC AT ONCE RETRACED HIS STEPS AND LEFT THE TOWN
NOT A SOUL WAS THERE IN CHARGE AND THE SOLE LIVING OCCUPANTS WERE A FLOCK OF WILD CORMORANTS WHICH STARTLED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE INTRUDERS ROSE ON WING AND TOOK A RAPID FLIGHT TOWARDS THE SOUTH
WAGNER IS A FOOL
THE SINGLE CAVE MUST BE THEIR DINING-ROOM DRAWING-ROOM AND DORMITORY ALL IN ONE
THERE MIGHT COME A TIME WHEN FOR MANY ARTICLES THE SUPPLY WOULD NOT BE EQUAL TO THE DEMAND
AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE THAT WAS FIFTEEN DEGREES
THEY ARE MINE SHRIEKED HAKKABUT
ON THE 15TH OF DECEMBER GALLIA WAS 276,000,000 LEAGUES FROM THE SUN AND AS IT WAS APPROXIMATELY TO THE EXTREMITY OF ITS AXIS MAJOR WOULD TRAVEL ONLY SOME 11,000,000 OR 12,000,000 LEAGUES DURING THE MONTH
LET US FORCE IT OPEN PROCOPE HE SAID
WE WILL SOON DEVISE SOME MEANS FOR GETTING ACROSS TO MOSTAGANEM IF AS I HOPE REJOINED THE CAPTAIN WE ARE ON A PENINSULA WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET TO TENES
HAD THE TOWNS OF ALGIERS ORAN AND MOSTAGANEM ESCAPED THE INUNDATION
ENGAGED AS HE WAS IN AN IMPORTANT MISSION AS A STAFF-OFFICER IN ALGERIA A FRENCH COLONY I BELIEVE INTERPOSED MAJOR OLIPHANT HALF SHUTTING HIS EYES WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SUPREME INDIFFERENCE
BUT LET ME HAVE MY COFFEE HE ADDED IMPATIENTLY
COUNT TIMASCHEFF EXPRESSING HIS REGRET THAT HIS PURSE CONTAINED ONLY PAPER MONEY BEGGED TO PLACE IT AT CAPTAIN SERVADAC'S DISPOSAL
NOT A SHIP HAS PASSED
TO LEAP ON SHORE TO CLAMBER OVER THE SLIPPERY STONES AND TO REACH THE CABIN WAS BUT THE WORK OF A FEW MOMENTS
CAPTAIN SERVADAC WAS EVIDENTLY IN NO HURRY TO BETAKE HIMSELF TO REST BUT SEATING HIMSELF AT HIS TABLE WITH A PAIR OF COMPASSES AND A SHEET OF TRACING-PAPER HE BEGAN TO DRAW WITH RED AND BLUE CRAYONS A VARIETY OF COLORED LINES WHICH COULD HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE MUCH CONNECTION WITH A TOPOGRAPHICAL SURVEY
THERE WAS NOTHING TO DISTURB THE EQUILIBRIUM OF THE CAR IN WHICH THEY WERE MAKING THEIR AERIAL ADVENTURE
BUT HERE WITH A SOLID SUBSOIL THE GALLIANS MIGHT HOPE TO DIG DOWN A HUNDRED FEET OR SO AND SECURE FOR THEMSELVES A SHELTER THAT WOULD ENABLE THEM TO BRAVE THE HARDEST SEVERITY OF CLIMATE
I AM COMMISSARIAT OFFICER AND I AM RESPONSIBLE I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE GOVERNOR'S AIDE-DE-CAMP SAID HAKKABUT
GIBRALTAR WHERE THE THIRTEEN ENGLISHMEN WERE AMPLY PROVISIONED FOR SOME YEARS TO COME AND THEIR OWN GOURBI ISLAND
THE STOCK OF COAL ON BOARD WAS ADEQUATE FOR TWO MONTHS CONSUMPTION
ACCORDINGLY HE MADE HIS WAY TO BEN ZOOF AND IN THE MOST AMIABLE TONE HE COULD ASSUME BEGGED AS A FAVOR THAT HE WOULD LET HIM HAVE A POUND OF COFFEE
HE HAD ALREADY DIRECTED HIS TELESCOPE TO BE MOVED BACK TO HIS FORMER OBSERVATORY WHERE AS MUCH AS THE COLD WOULD PERMIT HIM HE PERSISTED IN MAKING HIS ALL-ABSORBING STUDIES OF THE HEAVENS
BUT SERVADAC NOTHING DAUNTED WENT ON TO DETAIL THE RESULTS OF THE COLLISION BETWEEN THE COMET AND THE EARTH ADDING THAT AS THERE WAS THE ALMOST IMMEDIATE PROSPECT OF ANOTHER CONCUSSION IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE ADVISABLE FOR THE WHOLE POPULATION OF GALLIA TO UNITE IN TAKING PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES FOR THE COMMON WELFARE
THE JEW AFRAID TO DISOBEY BUT WITH HIS EYE EVER UPON THE MAIN CHANCE STIPULATED THAT AT THE END OF THEIR VOYAGE THE SPANIARDS SHOULD PAY FOR THEIR PASSAGE--TERMS TO WHICH AS THEY WOULD TO ANY OTHER THEY DID NOT DEMUR KNOWING THAT THEY HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION OF GIVING HIM A SINGLE REAL
HE SLEPT BUT LITTLE
CHAPTER XII
CHAPTER XII
EUROPE INDEED MUTTERED THE JEW MALICIOUSLY BETWEEN HIS TEETH
IT WAS THE 31ST OF DECEMBER
WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN EXCLAIMED THE COUNT
NO SAID PROCOPE
THE MOST OBVIOUS INFERENCE WOULD THEREFORE BE THAT THE EARTH'S DISTANCE FROM THE SUN HAD BEEN DIMINISHED FROM 91,000,000 TO 66,000,000 MILES
YOU'LL NOT REPENT THE ENTRANCE MONEY YOU HAVE SPENT
THEY CAN BETAKE THEMSELVES THITHER JUST WHEN THEY PLEASE
NOT A VESTIGE OF IT ALL REMAINED
MALAGA ALMERIA CAPE GATA CARTHAGENA
HUMBUG ROARED ROSETTE
THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW ORBIT BUT SHE IS NOT INCURRING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED ONTO THE SUN CAN YOU SATISFY US OF THAT ASKED THE COUNT
THIS ENORMOUS CAVERN WAS NEITHER MORE OR LESS THAN THE COMMON JUNCTION OF NEARLY TWENTY TUNNELS SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH HAD BEEN TRAVERSED BY THE EXPLORERS FORMING RAMIFICATIONS IN THE SOLID ROCK AND THE PORES AS IT WERE BY WHICH THE INTERNAL HEAT EXUDED FROM THE HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN
A GENERAL SEARCH WAS INSTITUTED AND BEFORE LONG THEY WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE CENTRAL GROTTO A SMALL RECESS OR REDUCT HOLLOWED AS IT WERE IN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE WHICH WOULD EXACTLY ANSWER THEIR PURPOSE
OR IT MAY BE AT EITHER POLE
HE INDULGED THE FANCY THAT HE MIGHT SUCCEED IN PRODUCING A COMPOSITION WHICH WOULD HAVE A FINE EFFECT HERE IN ALGERIA WHERE POETRY IN THAT FORM WAS ALL BUT UNKNOWN
WHY GIBRALTAR HAD BEEN REACHED AS IF IT HAD BEEN JUST AT CORFU AND SOME THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DEGREES OF THE EARTH'S CIRCUIT HAD VANISHED UTTERLY
BEN ZOOF ADMITTED THE NECESSITY OF EXTEMPORIZING A KIND OF PARASOL FOR HIMSELF OTHERWISE HE MUST LITERALLY HAVE BEEN ROASTED TO DEATH UPON THE EXPOSED SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF
AMONG THE STORES WERE SEVERAL BARRELS OF OIL AND A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF SPIRITS OF WINE WHICH MIGHT BE BURNED WHEN REQUIRED FOR COOKING PURPOSES
WHAT IF HE SHOULD NEVER AGAIN BEHOLD HIS GERMAN FATHERLAND
YOU SEE CONSEQUENTLY THAT THE FORCE OF GRAVITY HERE ON GALLIA IS NOT ONE-SEVENTH OF WHAT IT IS UPON THE EARTH INTERESTING CRIED SERVADAC MOST INTERESTING
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED THE COUNT SOMEWHAT TAKEN BY SURPRISE
NOR COULD ANY AMOUNT OF FUEL BE ENOUGH
IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A CESSATION OF THE VOLCANIC ERUPTION WHILST THE COMET WAS STILL AT SO GREAT A DISTANCE FROM THE SUN THEY WOULD INDEED BE AT A LOSS TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE FOR WHAT ALONE HAD SERVED TO RENDER LIFE ENDURABLE AT A TEMPERATURE OF 60 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
IT WAS ENTIRELY ENCLOSED BY ROCKS AND IF EVER A FEW ICICLES WERE FORMED THERE BY THE ACTION OF THE COLD THEY WERE VERY SOON MELTED BY THE FIERY SHOWER
IT COULD NOT BE THE COAST OF TRIPOLI
I DO NOT DENY YOUR THEORY SAID PROCOPE AFTER A WHILE
THE MONOPOLY OF THE MARKET BELONGS TO ME
SOME MINUTES MORE WERE THUS CONSUMED AND THE INTERVAL OF DISTANCE WAS REDUCED TO LESS THAN 8,000 MILES
WHAT DOES THE MAN WANT WITH EUROPE I WANT TO GET THERE SCREECHED THE JEW
BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN A CUNNING LIGHT GLEAMED FROM HIS EYES AND HIS LIPS BECAME COMPRESSED WITH A GRIM SIGNIFICANCE
WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME SHE MUST BE BROUGHT ROUND TO THE MOUTH OF THE SHELIF IN IMMEDIATE PROXIMITY TO THE RUSSIAN YACHT
THE ORBIT OF SATURN IS REMOTE AND DOES NOT COME ATHWART OUR PATH
THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND GOURBI ISLAND
IT WAS THEREFORE A CONSIDERABLE DISAPPOINTMENT TO HIM THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE HEAVY CLOUDS NOT A STAR WAS VISIBLE IN THE FIRMAMENT
RATHER A BAD STAIRCASE SAID BEN ZOOF AS THEY BEGAN TO MAKE THEIR WAY DOWN
NOTHING SIR
THE DARKNESS THAT RETURNED TO THE FACE OF THE EARTH WAS NOT MORE PROFOUND THAN THE GLOOM WHICH FELL UPON THE CAPTAIN'S SOUL
I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECKON THAT EVER SINCE I WAS BORN COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO CRIED BEN ZOOF DELIGHTED AT ANY OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OFF HIS OLD GRUDGE
IF CAPTAIN SERVADAC HAD BEEN MORE DEEPLY VERSED IN ASTRONOMY HE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BRING TO BEAR HIS KNOWLEDGE THAT IF THE AXIS OF THE EARTH AS EVERYTHING SEEMED TO INDICATE NOW FORMED A RIGHT ANGLE WITH THE PLANE OF THE ECLIPTIC HER VARIOUS SEASONS LIKE THOSE OF THE PLANET JUPITER WOULD BECOME LIMITED TO CERTAIN ZONES IN WHICH THEY WOULD REMAIN INVARIABLE
NEARLY EVERY SPECIES OF THE FEATHERED TRIBE SEEMED TO HAVE ITS REPRESENTATIVE IN THAT LIVING CLOUD
A STEELYARD UNDER THE STILL DIMINISHING INFLUENCE OF THE SUN'S ATTRACTION BUT WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE GALLIA CONTINUED ITS INTERPLANETARY COURSE ACCOMPANIED BY NERINA ITS CAPTURED SATELLITE WHICH PERFORMED ITS FORTNIGHTLY REVOLUTIONS WITH UNVARYING REGULARITY
THE ENTIRE ISLAND WAS LESS THAN A QUARTER OF A MILE IN CIRCUMFERENCE
I FEEL AS IF I HAD ONLY JUST GONE TO SLEEP YOU HAVE SLEPT ALL NIGHT AT ANY RATE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
HER GAY ITALIAN SONGS BROKE THE MONOTONY OF THE DEPRESSING SILENCE
SCARCELY A YARD OF GROUND WAS LEFT UNEXPLORED THE HORSES CLEARING EVERY OBSTACLE AS IF THEY WERE LIKE PEGASUS FURNISHED WITH WINGS
AND AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN THE YAWL WAS AT ONCE PUT WITH HER HEAD TO THE NORTHEAST AND CAPTAIN SERVADAC IN DEFIANCE OF THE ICY BLAST REMAINED STANDING AT THE BOW HIS GAZE FIXED ON THE HORIZON
LOOKING TOWARDS THE NORTH HE COULD DISTINGUISH GIBRALTAR FAINTLY VISIBLE IN THE EXTREME DISTANCE AND UPON THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCK BOTH BEN ZOOF AND HIMSELF FANCIED THEY COULD MAKE OUT ANOTHER SEMAPHORE GIVING SIGNALS NO DOUBT IN RESPONSE TO THE ONE HERE
THE HEAT UPON GOURBI ISLAND IS NOT GREATER NOW THAN WE MIGHT ORDINARILY EXPECT TO FIND IN ALGERIA
TO THE GREAT REGRET OF THEIR OWNERS THE TWO HORSES AND NINA'S PET GOAT WERE OBLIGED TO BE LEFT BEHIND
MOREOVER I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE SUN AS WE HAVE BEEN
IF IT BE CORRECT I SUPPOSE WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT THE ENORMOUS DISC WE OBSERVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE CATASTROPHE WAS THE COMET ITSELF
NOTWITHSTANDING THE INCREASING COLD THE SEA UNRUFFLED AS IT WAS BY A BREATH OF WIND STILL RETAINED ITS LIQUID STATE
A MOLE-HILL LIKE MONTMARTRE WOULD HAVE BEEN GROUND TO POWDER IN A MOMENT MOLE-HILL EXCLAIMED BEN ZOOF STUNG TO THE QUICK
SERVADAC EMPLOYED THE INTERVAL IN MAKING THE COUNT ACQUAINTED WITH ALL HE KNEW ABOUT HIS SMALL DOMAIN
ALL RIGHT PARFAIT THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED AT LEAST IT SHOWS THAT WHOEVER WROTE IT HAD NO MURMURING OR COMPLAINT TO MAKE BUT WAS QUITE CONTENT WITH THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS CHAPTER XVI
HAD THE BALLOON BEEN LESS CUMBERSOME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONVEYED TO THE ISLAND WHENCE THE START WOULD HAVE BEEN EFFECTED
ONLY SIX HOURS INSTEAD OF TWELVE ELAPSED BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNRISE
YOU MUST BE AWARE GENTLEMEN BEGAN THE COUNT THAT A MOST SINGULAR CATASTROPHE OCCURRED ON THE 1ST OF JANUARY LAST
I PRESUME THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THE DATE ASSENTED THE COUNT
IT SHAN'T BE SAID THAT A FRENCH OFFICER CANNOT COPE WITH A PIECE OF POETRY
A LOT OF LIES PRETTY ONE
THE ORDERLY HOWEVER CONSOLED HIMSELF WITH THE REFLECTION THAT HE HAD BEEN TEMPORARILY INVESTED WITH THE FULL POWERS OF GOVERNOR GENERAL AN OFFICE OF WHICH HE WAS NOT A LITTLE PROUD
TOO LATE SIR DO YOU THINK SAID BEN ZOOF
WHILST THE LARGEST OF ALL TAKES BUT 16 DAYS 16 HOURS 32 MINUTES
GALLIA WAS NOW WITHIN 96,000,000 MILES OF THE SUN CONSEQUENTLY NOT MUCH MORE THAN 4,000,000 MILES FROM THE EARTH
YOU ARE GOING THE RIGHT WAY TO RUIN YOURSELF AND IT WOULD SERVE YOU RIGHT TO LEAVE YOU TO YOUR OWN DEVICES
BEN ZOOF WAS SURE THAT HIS OWN POWERS OF PROPELLING MUST EQUAL THOSE OF A HOWITZER FOR HIS STONE AFTER A LENGTHENED FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR FELL TO THE GROUND FULL FIVE HUNDRED PACES THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROCK
IT HAD BEEN A TELEGRAPH IN MOTION THAT HAD CAUGHT HIS EYE
BUT THEIR LIFE MUST NECESSARILY BE SHORT
NOR COULD HE MAKE OUT THE AUREOLE OF LIGHT WHICH EMANATES FROM WHAT ASTRONOMERS HAVE DESIGNATED MOUNT TYCHO
BUT THE HYPOTHESIS ENTIRELY FAILED TO ACCOUNT EITHER FOR THE SHORTENING OF THE DAYS OR FOR THE DIMINUTION IN THE PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
THIS WAS THE DIMINUTION IN THE LENGTH OF DAY AND NIGHT
THE FEAT YOU PROPOSE IS IMPOSSIBLE
AND AS REGARDS IMAGINATION AND THE ELEMENTS OF MYSTERY AND AWE SURELY IN THE UNDERGROUND CITY WITH ITS CAVERN WORLD ITS SECRET UNDISCOVERABLE UNRELENTING FOE THE HARFANG BIRD OF EVIL OMEN AND THE FIRE MAIDENS OF THE RUINED CASTLE SURELY WITH ALL THESE IMAGINATION IS ANYTHING BUT LACKING
THE CAPTAIN WAS ACTUATED BY NO PERSONAL ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE COUNT
MEANWHILE AS JUPITER GREW LARGE THE SUN GREW SMALL
THE VISITORS ACCORDINGLY QUITTED THE OBSERVATORY
SHALL YOU WEIGH ME THE COFFEE WITH MY STEELYARD HE ASKED IN A QUAVERING VOICE THAT CONFIRMED THE PROFESSOR'S SUSPICIONS
WHY IS IT THAT YOU DOUBT MY WORD THE CAPTAIN'S RISING WRATH DID NOT PREVENT THE COLONEL FROM REPLYING COOLLY BECAUSE MALTA BELONGS TO ENGLAND I CAN'T HELP THAT ANSWERED SERVADAC SHARPLY
HITHERTO THE CONVERSATION HAD THROWN NO LIGHT UPON THE FUTURE MOVEMENTS OF GALLIA AND ROSETTE WAS DISPOSED APPARENTLY TO EVADE OR AT LEAST TO POSTPONE THE SUBJECT
SPEECHLESS WITH AMAZEMENT THEY STOOD STILL FOR SOME MOMENTS
AS IRON IS ATTRACTED BY THE MAGNET SO WAS THIS SHYLOCK ATTRACTED BY THE SIGHT OF GOLD NOR WOULD HE HAVE HESITATED TO DRAW THE LIFE-BLOOD OF HIS CREDITORS IF BY SUCH MEANS HE COULD SECURE HIS CLAIMS
5
THE MOST SERIOUS REMONSTRANCES ON THEIR PART WERE ENTIRELY IN VAIN
ROSETTE UNCLOSED HIS EYES AND FIXED THEM FULL UPON THE ORDERLY'S FACE
WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH ALL FUEL FOR COOKING PURPOSES
I WAS UNABLE TO TAKE THE ALTITUDE OF SUN OR STAR AT WHAT RESULT DID YOU ARRIVE
WELL THEN NINA CAN YOU TELL US WHERE WE ARE AT MADALENA I THINK SAID THE LITTLE GIRL
THE SAIL WAS QUICKLY HOISTED AND THE SLEDGE JUST AS IF IT HAD EXPANDED A HUGE WHITE WING WAS IN A LITTLE WHILE CARRIED FAR AWAY BEYOND THE HORIZON
NOR DID THE ANIMAL WORLD ASSERT THE FEEBLEST SWAY
AT THE MERCY OF THE WINDS AS THE AFFRIGHTED CORMORANTS HAD WINGED THEIR FLIGHT TOWARDS THE SOUTH THERE SPRANG UP A SANGUINE HOPE ON BOARD THE SCHOONER THAT LAND MIGHT BE DISCOVERED IN THAT DIRECTION
CHAPTER II
CHAPTER II
OF THE WHOLE EARTH NOTHING REMAINS EXCEPT THIS ISLAND ON WHICH YOU ARE NOW TAKING REFUGE
CHAPTER IV
IT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT THE PACKET IS SHORT WEIGHT
AND THE SMOKE THAT ROSE FROM THE CABIN CHIMNEY OF THE HANSA WAS THE SOLE INDICATION OF THE PROPRIETOR BEING STILL ON BOARD
WHAT CROWDS MUST BE FLOCKING TO THE CHURCHES
CHAPTER VI
CHAPTER VI
THAT WOULD BE THE TIME FOR HIM
THE SUNSET UPON THIS CONTRACTED HORIZON WAS VERY REMARKABLE
NO CONCESSION IS POSSIBLE HE REPLIED RESOLUTELY
NOW THE TWO BODIES MAY IMPINGE EITHER DIRECTLY OR OBLIQUELY
YOU MUST COMPLETE YOUR CONTRACT AND MOANING AND GROANING THE MISERABLE MAN WAS DRIVEN TO MAKE UP THE FULL WEIGHT AS REGISTERED BY HIS OWN STEELYARD
THEIR ANTICIPATIONS HAD ALREADY REALIZED WHAT THEY SAW
IT WAS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD SURVIVE THE COLD THAT WOULD SOON ENSUE
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE ACCORDINGLY UNDERTOOK THE TASK OF EXPLORING ALL THE GALLERIES AND WAS SOON ABLE TO REPORT THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED ONE WHICH HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE ABUTTED UPON THE CENTRAL FUNNEL
WE MUST BE PHILOSOPHERS AND SOMETHING MORE
IT IS I PRESUME TO BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED CONTINUED LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THAT THE MASS OF THE EARTH IS COMPARATIVELY SO LARGE THAT IN THE EVENT OF A DIRECT COLLISION HER OWN MOTION WOULD NOT BE SENSIBLY RETARDED AND THAT SHE WOULD CARRY THE COMET ALONG WITH HER AS PART OF HERSELF VERY LITTLE QUESTION OF THAT I SHOULD THINK SAID SERVADAC
THE WEATHER WAS STILL SUPERB
YOU WILL I HOPE SOME DAY FIND OUT THAT IT DOES ANSWERED HIS MASTER
ALL AT ONCE IN THE VERY HEAT OF HIS ARGUMENT PROCOPE PAUSED
I CAN QUITE IMAGINE THAT WE ARE OCCASIONING NO SMALL EXCITEMENT IN ALL THE CHIEF OBSERVATORIES AY MORE THAN THAT SAID THE LIEUTENANT
BEN ZOOF WAS DEVOTED BODY AND SOUL TO HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
ALLUDING TO ROSETTE SERVADAC TOOK CARE TO INFORM HIS COMPANIONS THAT ALTHOUGH THE PROFESSOR WAS ALWAYS ECCENTRIC AND AT TIMES VERY IRASCIBLE YET HE WAS REALLY EXCEEDINGLY GOOD-HEARTED
UNFOLDED LAY THE PAST AND THE PRESENT BEFORE THEM
SOME OF YOUR MONEY
IN ONE CORNER OF THE COMPARTMENT STOOD A SMALL IRON STOVE IN WHICH SMOLDERED A BARE HANDFUL OF COALS
YOU IDIOT HE ANGRILY EXCLAIMED
FAR BETTER OUT OF THE REACH OF AN ATTRACTION WHICH BY AFFECTING THEIR PATH MIGHT HAVE ANNIHILATED THEIR BEST HOPES
THE SOLDIERS APPEARED TO HAVE THRIVEN WELL ON WHAT NO DOUBT HAD BEEN A GENEROUS DIET AND THE MAJOR HIMSELF ALTHOUGH HE WOULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN WILLING TO ALLOW IT WAS SLIGHTLY STOUTER THAN BEFORE
ELSEWHERE THERE MAY BE BARREN STEEPS BUT NONE SO RIGID AS NOT TO AFFORD SOME HOLD TO VEGETATION HOWEVER LOW AND ELEMENTARY MAY BE ITS TYPE
YET THE EARTH WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ALTERATION IN ITS CONVEXITY IN THIS PART OF AFRICA AT LEAST SEEMED TO HAVE UNDERGONE NO CHANGE OF ANY VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE
ONE GLANCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE EXPLORERS THAT THE GRATEFUL LIGHT AND HEAT OF THIS HUGE EXCAVATION WERE TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO A TORRENT OF LAVA THAT WAS ROLLING DOWNWARDS TO THE SEA COMPLETELY SUBTENDING THE APERTURE OF THE CAVE
BUT WHAT SECURITY WOULD YOU GIVE
MEANWHILE THE CAPTAIN WAS RACKING HIS BRAIN IN HIS EXERTIONS TO RECALL WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS PREVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FRENCHMAN UPON WHOSE FEATURES HE WAS GAZING
RATHER AS THE COUNT OBSERVED IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING THE PROJECTING SUMMIT OF A MOUNTAIN ALL BUT SUBMERGED
THE ARGUMENTS THAT HE HAD INTENDED TO USE HAD COMPLETELY FALLEN THROUGH
EVASIONS
IF EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO THE COMET AFTER ONCE APPEARING WITHIN THE RANGE OF TERRESTRIAL VISION WOULD VANISH FOREVER IN THE OUTLYING REGIONS OF SPACE
INTEREST AND ACCORDINGLY CHUCKLED WITHIN HIMSELF AT HIS UNEXPECTED STROKE OF BUSINESS
HE GABBLES EVERY TONGUE UNDER THE SUN YES SAID SERVADAC
YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT TILL THEY ARE FINISHED AS LONG AS YOU PLEASE SAID THE COUNT
THEN LET US LOSE NO TIME IN TRYING ANSWERED THE PROFESSOR AS HE HUSTLED WITH HASTY STRIDES INTO THE GALLERY
HOWEVER CONSCIENTIOUSLY THE ASSISTANT ON THE SPANISH COAST MIGHT LOOK TO THE KINDLING OF THE BEACON ROSETTE HAD NO GLANCES TO SPARE FOR THAT DIRECTION
ANOTHER MESSAGE NO DOUBT CRIED THE CAPTAIN FROM OUR UNKNOWN FRIEND
NO DOUBT SAID BEN ZOOF THIS TIME WE SHALL STICK TOGETHER ANOTHER THOUGHT OCCURRED
HE WAS CAREFUL HOWEVER TO MAKE IT UNDERSTOOD THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE ORIGINAL CAUSE OF THE DISRUPTION HE HAD NO THEORY TO OFFER
IN ONE POINT AT LEAST IT APPEARS TO ME TO BREAK DOWN COMPLETELY WHAT IS THAT ASKED THE LIEUTENANT
HE WOULD CONFISCATE IT ALL RATHER THAN THAT YOU SHOULD BE ROBBED OF IT WITH THIS JOB'S COMFORT THE JEW HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO CONTENT HIMSELF AS BEST HE COULD AND TO AWAIT THE PROMISED ARRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR
BUT WHAT OF GALLIA HE INQUIRED STILL NERVOUSLY
WHAT FOR TO KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT WITH COUNT TIMASCHEFF BY JOVE
FOR THE LAST HOUR HE HAS BEEN AS FIDGETY AS A BIRD RETURNING AFTER ITS WINTER MIGRATION SERVADAC SUDDENLY STARTED FROM HIS SEAT AND AS HE PACED THE ROOM WITH ALL THE FRENZY OF POETIC INSPIRATION READ OUT
EVERY SHOT TOLD
AND BEN ZOOF WHO HAD UPON SOME RARE OCCASIONS SKATED UPON THE LAKE OF MONTMARTRE IN HIS EYES OF COURSE A SEA PERFORMED PRODIGIES IN THE ART
OR WAS IT NOT MORE PROBABLE THAT THE MEDITERRANEAN HAD MERELY INVADED THE REGION OF THE MOUTH OF THE SHELIF
IN THE FIRST PLACE LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WAS CONVINCED THAT IT COULD NOT BE MUCH LONGER NOW BEFORE THE SEA WOULD BE ENTIRELY FROZEN
CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND I NOW BEG TO OFFER YOU MY SINCERE APOLOGIES FOR FAILING TO KEEP MY APPOINTMENT WITH YOU NEVER MIND NOW INTERPOSED THE CAPTAIN
BUT THE JACKAL DEEMING IT ON THE WHOLE PRUDENT TO DECAMP DISAPPEARED ACROSS THE TREES AND HEDGES WITH A SERIES OF BOUNDS WHICH COULD ONLY BE LIKENED TO THOSE THAT MIGHT BE MADE BY AN INDIA-RUBBER KANGAROO
IT HAD OCCURRED TO SERVADAC THAT IF SOME COMMUNICATION COULD BE OPENED WITH GOURBI ISLAND THERE WOULD BE A FINE SCOPE FOR HUNTING EXPEDITIONS
WHAT WOULD BE ITS PERIOD ROUND THE SUN
YOU ARE CORRECT TO A CERTAIN DEGREE CONTINUED THE PROFESSOR
DEAD OF COLD AND HUNGER LIEUTENANT PROCOPE BENT DOWN AND ANXIOUSLY CONTEMPLATED THE BODY
THEY REACHED THE MASCARA GATE
IN SPITE OF THE DENIAL WHICH ASTRONOMER AFTER ASTRONOMER GAVE TO THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH A COMET AS GALLIA AT ALL AND OF ITS BEING REFUSED ADMISSION TO THE CATALOGUE HE PUBLISHED A VOLUMINOUS TREATISE NOT ONLY DETAILING HIS OWN ADVENTURES BUT SETTING FORTH WITH THE MOST ELABORATE PRECISION ALL THE ELEMENTS WHICH SETTLED ITS PERIOD AND ITS ORBIT
ONE DAY AN EXCURSION WAS MADE TO THE SHORE
ALWAYS OBEDIENT TO HIS MASTER BEN ZOOF HELD HIS TONGUE
GALLIA WEIGHED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER THE VISITORS TO THE HANSA HAD REASSEMBLED IN THE COMMON HALL OF NINA'S HIVE
ALTHOUGH THE TEMPERATURE WAS HIGH IT WAS NOT IN ANY WAY INTOLERABLE
BUT I FEEL DISPOSED TO BREAK THE OLD TELESCOPE INTO ATOMS BEN ZOOF SAID SERVADAC HIS LAUGHTER EXCHANGED FOR A LOOK OF STERN DISPLEASURE TOUCH THAT TELESCOPE AND YOU SHALL SWING FOR IT THE ORDERLY LOOKED ASTONISHED
THEN ON THE 15TH ABOUT FIFTY HEAD OF LIVE CATTLE--BULLOCKS COWS SHEEP AND PIGS--WERE CONVEYED TO THEIR ROCKY STALLS
I AM NOT SURE THAT THAT COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED SAID THE LIEUTENANT
BUT TO-DAY I TELL YOU
WHENCE CAME IT THAT THE ELEMENTS UNITED IN ONE DEAFENING CRASH
FOUR STURDY MAJOS HAD DRAGGED ALONG WITH THEM AN OLD MAN INCAPABLE OF RESISTANCE AND COMPELLED HIM NOLENS VOLENS TO JOIN IN THE DANCE
MASTER IF ONLY WE WERE AT MONTMARTRE WE WOULD GET SHELTER IN THE CHARMING STONE-QUARRIES IDIOT REPLIED THE CAPTAIN ANGRILY IF WE WERE AT MONTMARTRE YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THAT WE SHOULD NEED TO LIVE IN STONE-QUARRIES BUT THE MEANS OF PRESERVATION WHICH HUMAN INGENUITY HAD FAILED TO SECURE WERE AT HAND FROM THE FELICITOUS PROVISION OF NATURE HERSELF
SNIPE LARKS ROOKS AND SWALLOWS
MOST LIKELY WE SHALL FIND ONE ON THE TARTAN SAID THE ORDERLY
OR WAS IT NOT TRULY THE REPORT OF ANOTHER AND A DISTANT GUN IN ANSWER TO THEIR OWN
AT THE SIGHT OF STRANGERS THEY PAUSED IN THEIR MUSIC AND SIMULTANEOUSLY THE DANCERS WITH THEIR VICTIM ALIGHTED GENTLY ON THE SWARD
A SPRING BALANCE FITTED WITH A HOOK HELD THE ARTICLE TO BE WEIGHED
HERE HE LIVED DAY AND NIGHT
NINA AND PABLO EARNED LOUD APPLAUSE BY THEIR RAPID PROFICIENCY
ARE YOU QUITE SURE THAT THE NEEDLE TOUCHES THE POINT YES
URANUS REVOLVING 1,753,851,000 MILES FROM THE CENTER OF THE PLANETARY SYSTEM IS OF AN AGE AMOUNTING TO MANY HUNDRED MILLIONS OF CENTURIES
A SUPPLY OF FOOD HAD TO BE SECURED AND PRESERVED
IN ONE IMPORTANT PARTICULAR THE PRESENT COMMUNICATION DIFFERED FROM THOSE THAT HAD PRECEDED IT
FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY THE OTHERS HE LED THE WAY TO A LEVEL PIECE OF GROUND WHICH HE CONSIDERED HE MIGHT FAIRLY CLAIM AS NEUTRAL TERRITORY
ON THE EVENTFUL NIGHT OF THE 1ST OF JANUARY THE HANSA HAD BEEN AT CEUTA THE POINT ON THE COAST OF MOROCCO EXACTLY OPPOSITE GIBRALTAR
YOU DEFRAUD ME OF MY PRIVILEGE
IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE OBVIOUS THAT OURS IS A VERY TINY WORLD AND THAT GOURBI ISLAND IS THE SOLE PRODUCTIVE SPOT UPON ITS SURFACE
SPECULATIONS OF THIS KIND BECAME MORE AND MORE FREQUENT AND LIEUTENANT PROCOPE POINTED OUT THAT THE DANGER INCURRED MIGHT BE OF A FOURFOLD CHARACTER
AND THAT YEAR LIKE EVERY OTHER YEAR OUGHT TO BE DIVIDED INTO TWELVE MONTHS YES CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH IT SAID THE CAPTAIN ACQUIESCING
OUR PRESERVED MEAT IS ALREADY COOKED
FIVE FATHOMS AND A FLAT BOTTOM WAS THE UNVARIED ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER EACH OPERATION
ENOUGH WAS OVERHEARD TO CONFIRM THE SUSPICION THAT THERE WAS SOME IRRECONCILABLE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE RESULTS OF HIS COMPUTATION AND WHAT HE HAD ACTUALLY OBSERVED
SUMMER AND AUTUMN SEEMED BLENDED INTO ONE
THE ENTERTAINMENT PASSED OFF MERRILY
HIS IMPRECATIONS ON THE ACCURSED RACE WERE FULL OF WRATH
IN THESE RETIRED QUARTERS THE ASTRONOMER TOOK UP HIS ABODE
FOR THREE SUCCESSIVE DAYS THE DOBRYNA LADEN TO HER VERY GUNWALE MADE A TRANSIT TO AND FRO
EVERY BODY OF MEN HE OBSERVED MUST HAVE A HEAD AND YOU AS A FRENCHMAN SHOULD I THINK TAKE THE COMMAND OF THIS FRAGMENT OF A FRENCH COLONY
WHY NOT IT IS NOT THE MOON AGAIN AFFIRMED THE CAPTAIN
THE NEXT THING REQUISITE WAS TO ARRIVE AT A TRUE ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF THE POPULATION
IN HIS IMPRESSION HE WAS MORE THOROUGHLY CONFIRMED WHEN AN HOUR LATER HE NOTICED THAT THE STAR HAD APPROACHED STILL NEARER THE HORIZON AS THOUGH IT HAD BELONGED TO ONE OF THE ZODIACAL CONSTELLATIONS
WHAT INTEREST I SAY WHAT INTEREST DO YOU ASK FALTERING AND UNDECIDED STILL THE JEW WENT ON
THE SIMPLEST MECHANICAL RULES SEEMED FALSIFIED
THE CONTINUANCE OF THE SPLENDID WEATHER AFFORDED SERVADAC EVERY FACILITY FOR OBSERVING THE HEAVENS
SUCH WERE THE THOUGHTS THAT MADE HIM RECEIVE ALL ROSETTE'S APPROACHES WITH A CAREFUL RESERVATION
DO YOU RECOGNIZE YOUR QUONDAM PUPIL PROFESSOR HE ASKED
LET US JUST SEE WHETHER THE WEIGHT IS CORRECT HAKKABUT POINTED OUT THAT THE WEIGHT WAS DULY REGISTERED ON EVERY PACKET AND THAT THE PACKETS HAD NEVER BEEN UNFASTENED
THE INTERVENING SPACES OF THE PLANET'S SUPERFICIES BETWEEN EDGE AND EDGE BEING INTENSELY BRIGHT
A CARRIER-PIGEON WHEN THREE HOURS AFTER SUNSET ON THE 23D OF MARCH THE GALLIAN MOON ROSE UPON THE WESTERN HORIZON IT WAS OBSERVED THAT SHE HAD ENTERED UPON HER LAST QUARTER
BY HEAVEN I ADJURE YOU LET US DISEMBARK AND MOUNT THE SUMMIT AND EXPLORE
WHAT RESOURCES COULD THEY EXPECT TO FIND UPON THAT SCENE OF DESOLATION
REDOUBLING HIS ATTENTION HE SOON SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT WHAT HE SAW WAS NOT A PLANET
CHAPTER XVI
HIS VOLUME 143,846 MILLIONS OF CUBIC MILES
OF THE ROCKY SUBSTRATUM OF THE PROVINCE IT BECAME MORE EVIDENT THAN EVER THAT NOT A TRACE REMAINED AND A NEW SOIL OF UNKNOWN FORMATION HAD CERTAINLY TAKEN THE PLACE OF THE OLD SANDY SEA-BOTTOM
THEN DON'T SAY A WORD TO ANYONE BUT FASTEN IT UP TIGHT IN YOUR KNAPSACK BEN ZOOF FOUND THE FLAG AND FOLDED IT UP AS HE WAS DIRECTED
SOME SHELTER MUST BE FOUND BEFORE THE TEMPERATURE SHOULD FALL TO 60 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
I CAN GIVE YOU A PROOF WHICH I THINK YOU WILL OWN IS CONCLUSIVE
IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO FIX MY OWN PRICES SERVADAC MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAD NO INTENTION OF SWERVING FROM HIS DECISION
ITS EFFECT UPON THE BURNING CURTAIN THAT COVERED THE APERTURE OF THE CENTRAL HALL WAS VERY REMARKABLE
TOWARDS THE SOUTH THERE SEEMED NO LIMIT TO THE LAND AND THE VOLCANO FORMED THE APEX OF A TRIANGLE OF WHICH THE BASE WAS BEYOND THE REACH OF VISION
THE MINERAL KINGDOM REIGNED SUPREME
INDEED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF HIS MOON HAD UTTERLY DISCONCERTED HIM AND THE PROBABILITY THAT HE SHOULD SOON LOSE HIS COMET ALSO PLUNGED HIM INTO AN EXCESS OF GRIEF WHICH HE PREFERRED TO BEAR IN SOLITUDE
WHAT THEN DID IT ALL AMOUNT TO
NOT EVEN TO CORPORAL PIM DID THEY COMMUNICATE THE OBJECT OF THEIR EXCURSION NOR SAY ONE SYLLABLE AS TO ITS RESULT AND IT COULD ONLY BE INFERRED FROM THEIR MANNER THAT THEY WERE QUITE SATISFIED WITH WHAT THEY HAD SEEN
CONFOUND IT
IS NOT THAT YOUR MEANING PRECISELY SO THE LIEUTENANT ACQUIESCED
ALTHOUGH HOWEVER THE BOTTOM OF THE CHASM HAD NEVER AS YET BEEN THE CHANNEL OF A STREAM INDICATIONS WERE NOT WANTING THAT AT SOME FUTURE TIME IT WOULD BE THE NATURAL OUTLET OF ACCUMULATED WATERS
THE WILL OF PROVIDENCE AND WE MUST SUBMIT REPLIED BEN ZOOF CALM AND UNDISTURBED
ITS RESERVOIR WOULD THROW THE MEDITERRANEAN INTO THE SHADE
OF THE PLANETS SOME IT WAS OBSERVED SEEMED TO BE FADING AWAY IN REMOTE DISTANCE
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
YOU WILL BREAK YOUR BACK AND WELL MIGHT HE BE ALARMED FOR BEN ZOOF HAD SPRUNG TO A HEIGHT OF FORTY FEET INTO THE AIR
FROM THE 6TH TO THE 13TH OF JANUARY THE RAIN CAME DOWN IN TORRENTS
THE HARD NUMERICAL STATEMENT OF THESE ENORMOUS FIGURES HOWEVER FAILS ALTOGETHER IN ANY ADEQUATE WAY TO CONVEY A DUE IMPRESSION OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE DISTANCES
BUT THE LIGHT CONTINUED UNCHANGED
THE WRITER OF IT WAS EVIDENTLY ENGAGED UPON A CALCULATION PROBABLY CONTINUED FROM DAY TO DAY AS TO THE MOTIONS OF THE PLANET GALLIA UPON ITS ORBIT AND COMMITTING THE RESULTS OF HIS RECKONINGS TO THE WAVES AS THE CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION
THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT BEING DESIROUS OF VERIFYING THE MEASUREMENT ALREADY MADE OF THE ARC OF THE MERIDIAN OF PARIS APPOINTED A SCIENTIFIC COMMISSION FOR THAT PURPOSE
NO REMONSTRANCES FROM HIS MASTER COULD INDUCE HIM TO ABANDON HIS WATCH FROM THE CLIFF
WAS IT NOT THE RESIDUE OF SOME EDIFICE THAT HAD CROWNED THE LUXURIANT HEADLAND OF ANTIBES OVERLOOKING NICE AND COMMANDING THE GORGEOUS PANORAMA THAT EMBRACED THE MARITIME ALPS AND REACHED BEYOND MONACO AND MENTONE TO THE ITALIAN HEIGHT OF BORDIGHERA
WHAT A FOOL I WAS NOT TO HAVE LEARNT MORE ASTRONOMY
INDEED AS TIME PASSED ON THE PROFESSOR SEEMED TO BECOME MORE AND MORE INACCESSIBLE
A POINT OF FAR GREATER INTEREST TO CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND HIS FRIENDS WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ASCERTAIN THE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH THE COMET WAS COMPOSED BUT THEY FELT PLEDGED TO RENDER THE PROFESSOR ANY AID THEY COULD IN THE RESEARCHES UPON WHICH HE HAD SET HIS HEART
SUMMER HAD ALMOST ABRUPTLY SUCCEEDED TO WINTER AND THE DAYS THOUGH ONLY THREE HOURS LONG WERE INTENSELY HOT
JUST BECAUSE THE MASS IS ALTERED YOU THINK THE VELOCITY IS ALTERED HOLD YOUR TONGUE CRIED THE CAPTAIN LOUDER THAN EVER
THE ASTRONOMER BIT HIS LIP SNORTED AND CAST AT HIM A WITHERING LOOK BUT DID NOT TAKE ANY FURTHER NOTICE
THE DIAMETER OF JUPITER IS 85,390 MILES NEARLY ELEVEN TIMES AS GREAT AS THAT OF THE EARTH
HE ASSERTED THAT THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF IT CARRIED CONVICTION TO HIS MIND AND THAT HE ENTERTAINED NO DOUBT BUT THAT IN THE COURSE OF TIME ALL APPARENTLY ANTAGONISTIC CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE EXPLAINED SO AS TO BECOME CONSISTENT WITH THE VIEW HE TOOK
ALL ALONG CAPTAIN SERVADAC HAD BEEN ACTING ONLY IN JEST
AND THE IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD AS TO THE PERIL THAT THREATENED IT AVERTED THE PANIC THAT WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED THE PUBLICATION OF THE FACTS AND LEFT THE PHILOSOPHER OF FORMENTERA IN SOLE POSSESSION OF THE GREAT SECRET
AND HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAD RECEIVED NO DEFINITE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE SUBJECT HE DID NOT THINK THAT THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES SHOULD PREVENT THEM FROM GIVING THE DAY ITS DUE MILITARY HONORS
BUT UNDERSTAND THAT I CONSIDER IT MY DUTY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CARGO IS TAKEN CARE OF
THE WEATHER REMAINED FINE AND ALTHOUGH A FEW CLOUDS HAD ACCUMULATED AND MIGHT HAVE CAUSED A TRIFLING FALL OF THE BAROMETER THEY WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY THREATENING TO DELAY THE DEPARTURE OF THE DOBRYNA
AND THE VELOCITY WITH WHICH IT WAS TRAVELING MUST HAVE BEEN SO GREAT THAT IT WAS HARDLY ARRESTED AT ALL BY THE ATTRACTION OF THE EARTH PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH ANSWERED COUNT TIMASCHEFF
WE ARE NOT TO TOUCH IT FINDING THE SUBORDINATES INCORRUPTIBLE ISAAC DETERMINED TO GO TO THE FOUNTAIN-HEAD
HE RELATED HOW THE SCHOONER HAD PUSHED HER WAY ONWARDS TO THE SOUTH AND HAD REACHED THE GULF OF CABES
HE HAD AN EXCELLENT CREW CONSISTING OF TIGLEW THE ENGINEER FOUR SAILORS NAMED NIEGOCH TOLSTOY ETKEF AND PANOFKA AND MOCHEL THE COOK
TWO YEARS AFTER SERVADAC LEFT THE LYCEE PROFESSOR ROSETTE HAD THROWN UP ALL EDUCATIONAL EMPLOYMENT IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT DEVOTE HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF ASTRONOMY
IT WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE THE START AT TWO O'CLOCK THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR OR TO SPEAK CORRECTLY 42 MINUTES 35.6 SECONDS BEFORE THE TIME PREDICTED BY THE PROFESSOR AS THE INSTANT OF COLLISION
CLAMBERED WITH NO LITTLE DIFFICULTY UP THE SLIPPERY ROCKS
THE BOAT WAS LOWERED AND MANNED BY THE FOUR SAILORS
THE WHOLE CONFIGURATION OF THE EARTH IS CLEAR
AND AT THE RATE HE HAS BEEN TRAVELING I WOULD LAY MY CAP TO A DISH OF COUSCOUS THAT IN LESS THAN THREE HOURS HE WILL HAVE SET HECTOR SERVADAC MUTE AND MOTIONLESS STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS
THERE HAD BEEN A NEW MOON ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING
WHEN THEREFORE LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WAS ABOUT TO PRESS HIS INQUIRIES IN A MORE CATEGORICAL FORM SERVADAC THINKING IT ADVISABLE NOT PREMATURELY TO PRESS THE LITTLE SAVANT TOO FAR INTERRUPTED HIM BY ASKING THE PROFESSOR HOW HE ACCOUNTED FOR THE EARTH HAVING SUFFERED SO LITTLE FROM SUCH A FORMIDABLE CONCUSSION
SERVADAC LAUGHED AND REMARKED THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THE PROFESSOR TALKING ABOUT THE 238TH OF JUNE AND THE 325TH OF DECEMBER
WHAT DO YOU WANT HE INQUIRED TIMOROUSLY
AND IN PUNCTUAL FULFILLMENT OF THE PROFESSOR'S APPOINTMENT A NOTE WAS DELIVERED TO SERVADAC TO SAY THAT HE WAS READY AND HOPED THAT DAY TO COMMENCE OPERATIONS FOR CALCULATING THE MASS AND DENSITY OF HIS COMET AS WELL AS THE FORCE OF GRAVITY AT ITS SURFACE
SALT WATER FREEZES ONLY AT A LOWER TEMPERATURE THAN FRESH
RAISING HIS HAND RESPECTFULLY TO HIS CAP WHICH HE WORE POISED JAUNTILY OVER HIS RIGHT EAR AND SCARCELY HELD ON BY THE STRAP BELOW HIS UNDER LIP THE CORPORAL WAITED PERMISSION TO SPEAK
3 DEGREES 25 MIN E THE VERY SPOT WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE ALGERIAN CAPITAL
CHEMIN PARCOURU DE JANV
HAKKABUT WAS LOCKING AWAY THE GOLD IN ONE OF THE DRAWERS
THE RIGHT BANK OF THE RIVER STILL CONTINUED TO BE THE MARGIN OF THE LAND AND ONLY IN ONE SPOT HAD ITS INTEGRITY BEEN IMPAIRED
CAPTAIN SERVADAC WAS NATURALLY MOST ANXIOUS TO GET WHAT NEWS HE COULD
AND WHAT AN INCREASED INTEREST BEGAN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SATELLITES
SERVADAC FOLLOWED
KEEP UP YOUR COURAGE COUNT SAID SERVADAC CHEERILY
A JOYFUL SIGHT GENTLEMEN HE EXCLAIMED
AB SOLE AU 15 FEV
NOT MUCH DOUBT ABOUT THAT SAID SERVADAC
IT HAD A SUPERFICIAL AREA OF ABOUT NINE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES
AND HE MADE HIS SALUTE AND WITHDREW
ANYWHERE WITH YOU YOUR EXCELLENCY WAS THE BOY'S PROMPT REPLY
STOP HE SAID
THERE IS--THERE MUST BE--SOMETHING MORE BEHIND THAT FROWNING ROCK
I AM A POOR MAN BEGAN THE JEW
LESS THAN ONE-SEVENTH OF A KILOGRAMME
THESE PECULIAR CONDITIONS RENDERED THE COLD ENDURABLE EVEN IN THE OPEN AIR
BY THE GOD OF ISRAEL
TEN FRANCS A DAY I THINK WOULD NOT BE UNREASONABLE CONSIDERING THE COUNT HAD NO PATIENCE TO ALLOW HIM TO FINISH WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO SAY
FROM THIS ELEVATION THEY ASCERTAINED THAT FROM THE BASE OF THE MERDEYAH TO THE MEDITERRANEAN A DISTANCE OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILES A NEW COAST LINE HAD COME INTO EXISTENCE
A COMET
A COMET
WINTER QUARTERS THE HABITATION THAT HAD NOW REVEALED ITSELF WELL LIGHTED AND THOROUGHLY WARM WAS INDEED MARVELOUS
SHE MAY GRAZE THE EARTH
TO THESE GENERAL OBSERVATIONS CAPTAIN SERVADAC OBJECTED THAT HE THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY THAT ANY ONE ON BOARD A SHIP WOULD USE A TELESCOPE-CASE FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT WOULD BE SURE TO USE A BOTTLE AS BEING MORE SECURE
NO NO SIR PROTESTED BEN ZOOF EMPHATICALLY
WHERE ROARED THE BEWILDERED ORDERLY
BUT SERVADAC RATHER AMUSED THAN OTHERWISE DETERMINED TO TRY ANOTHER FORM OF PERSUASION
WE WILL PROCEED TO CONSIDER THE INFINITELY MORE SERIOUS ALTERNATIVE OF DIRECT IMPACT
WE CAN BEAR STRAIGHT DOWN UPON IT WHENEVER WE LIKE BEAR DOWN THEN NOW
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS GREATER DENSITY THE ATTRACTION OF GALLIA WOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN ONE-FIFTEENTH INSTEAD OF ONE-SEVENTH OF THE TERRESTRIAL ATTRACTION THE PROFESSOR COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM EXHIBITING HIS GRATIFICATION THAT HOWEVER INFERIOR IN VOLUME IN DENSITY AT LEAST HIS COMET HAD THE ADVANTAGE OVER THE EARTH
HE WAS REJOICED AT LAST TO HELP HIS MASTER WHO IN SPITE OF HIS PERPLEXED PREOCCUPATION SEEMED TO HAVE A VERY FAIR APPETITE FOR BREAKFAST
I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING CAPTAIN SERVADAC SAID THE COUNT IN HIS TURN
AND YET IF HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO SAY HE WOULD HAVE SOONER INSISTED THAT THERE WAS DERANGEMENT IN THE LAWS OF CELESTIAL MECHANISM THAN HAVE OWNED THERE WAS THE LEAST PROBABILITY OF ERROR IN ANY OF HIS OWN CALCULATIONS
TYLER DANIELS COMPANY INC
BUT DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THE USE OF A NEW CALENDAR SUCH AS THIS WOULD PRACTICALLY BE VERY TROUBLESOME NOT AT ALL
VIEWED EVEN FROM THIS HEIGHT WHENCE DISTANCE WOULD DO MUCH TO SOFTEN THE GENERAL ASPERITY THE SURFACE NEVERTHELESS SEEMED TO BE BRISTLING WITH ITS MYRIADS OF HEXAGONAL LAMELLAE AND TO PRESENT DIFFICULTIES WHICH TO AN ORDINARY PEDESTRIAN WOULD BE INSURMOUNTABLE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HIS MASTER ASKED
SERVADAC COULD NOT SUPPRESS A CRY OF DISMAY
BOTH TIMASCHEFF AND SERVADAC WERE MUCH INTERESTED IN WATCHING THE OPERATIONS
BOTH OF THEM WERE ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE
AT FIRST IMAGINING THAT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF SOME SPECTRAL ILLUSION HE OBSERVED IT WITH SILENT ATTENTION
AS THE EXPLORERS ADVANCED THEY SEEMED GLAD TO PAUSE FROM TIME TO TIME THAT THEY MIGHT RECOVER THEIR BREATH
AS SOON AS BEN ZOOF CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE ROCK ON THE WESTERN HORIZON HE WAS ALL EXCITEMENT
TURKEY LIKE AN INSOLENT COCK APPEARED TO CLUTCH THE SHORES OF ASIA WITH THE ONE CLAW AND THE LAND OF GREECE WITH THE OTHER
FROM THE DAY THAT ISAAC HAKKABUT HAD ENTERED UPON HIS MERCANTILE CAREER HIS DEALINGS HAD ALL BEEN CARRIED ON BY A SYSTEM OF FALSE WEIGHT
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS LESS BUOYANT THAN THAT OF THE EARTH BUT NO DIFFICULTY IN ASCENDING WAS TO BE APPREHENDED
I MEAN THOSE LAZY BEGGARS THAT ARE SHIRKING THEIR WORK
HERE A LARGE PORTION OF THE BANK HAD BEEN SWEPT AWAY AND THE HAMLET WITH ITS EIGHT HUNDRED INHABITANTS HAD NO DOUBT BEEN SWALLOWED UP BY THE ENCROACHING WATERS
ITS REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS SHEDDING UPON IT A LIGHT AND A HEAT SEVEN TIMES GREATER THAN THAT RECEIVED BY THE EARTH
ALL AT ONCE HIS ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY A LUMINOUS SPECK STRAIGHT AHEAD ON THE SOUTHERN HORIZON
MIGHT NOT THAT INFLUENCE BE ALTOGETHER DISASTROUS
BUT CAPTAIN SERVADAC WAS NO METEOROLOGIST AND IT IS TO BE DOUBTED WHETHER SINCE LEAVING SCHOOL HE HAD EVER OPENED HIS COURSE OF COSMOGRAPHY BESIDES HE HAD OTHER THOUGHTS TO OCCUPY HIS MIND
THE RUSSIAN SAILORS FOLLOWING A NORTHERN CUSTOM SKATED IN FILE MAINTAINING THEIR RANK BY MEANS OF A LONG POLE PASSED UNDER THEIR RIGHT ARMS AND IN THIS WAY THEY DESCRIBED A TRACKWAY OF SINGULAR REGULARITY
HIS FOOT HAD COME IN CONTACT WITH SOMETHING HARD BENEATH THE SNOW AND STOOPING DOWN HE PICKED UP A LITTLE BLOCK OF STONY SUBSTANCE WHICH THE FIRST GLANCE REVEALED TO BE OF A GEOLOGICAL CHARACTER ALTOGETHER ALIEN TO THE UNIVERSAL ROCKS AROUND
THERE IS NO ACCOUNTING FOR THE FREAKS OF PHILOSOPHERS YOU KNOW SAID SERVADAC
ON THE SOUTH ROSE THE VOLCANO THE EXTREMITY OF THE PROMONTORY THAT JUTTED OUT FROM THE CONTINENT THAT FORMED THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SEA
AS THE DAYS ARE ONLY HALF AS LONG AS THEY WERE WE SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER OUR PAY IS TO BE DIMINISHED IN PROPORTION THE COLONEL WAS TAKEN SOMEWHAT ABACK AND DID NOT REPLY IMMEDIATELY THOUGH BY SOME SIGNIFICANT NODS TOWARDS THE MAJOR HE INDICATED THAT HE THOUGHT THE QUESTION VERY REASONABLE
PRESENTLY TWO LINES ONE RED THE OTHER BLUE APPEARED UPON THE PAPER AND THE CAPTAIN MURMURED
WHY ISN'T HER MASS DIMINISHED
ALTHOUGH I AM NOT PRECISELY A VOLUNTARY RESIDENT ON YOUR COMET MR PROFESSOR I BEG TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR COURTEOUS RECEPTION GRAVELY RESPONDED TIMASCHEFF
AS CAPTAIN SERVADAC REMARKED IT WAS ALMOST A SUBSTITUTE FOR RAILWAYS AND AS IF TO ILLUSTRATE THIS PROPOSITION LIEUTENANT PROCOPE PERHAPS THE GREATEST EXPERT IN THE PARTY ACCOMPLISHED THE TWENTY MILES TO GOURBI ISLAND AND BACK IN CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN FOUR HOURS
LOVERS SHOULD WHOE'ER THEY BE LOVE IN ALL SIMPLICITY
WELL BEN ZOOF WAS THE CAPTAIN'S INVARIABLE RESPONSE TO HIS SERVANT'S FORMULA
NEVER FAILING TO TURN TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE THE FEW INTERVALS WHEN THE MIST LIFTED A LITTLE THE ASTRONOMER WOULD AT THE SAME TIME CAST AN INQUIRING GLANCE AT THE FIRMAMENT AS HE WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN THE REVISION OF THE CHART OF THE HEAVENS IN THE REGION CONTIGUOUS TO THE CONSTELLATION GEMINI
THERE WE SHALL HEAR THE NEWS FAR MORE LIKELY TO CARRY THE NEWS OURSELVES ANSWERED BEN ZOOF AS HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN FOR HIS NIGHT'S REST
THE RUSSIAN SAILORS EVER SUPERSTITIOUS SEEMED ALMOST TO REGARD THE COMING OF THE CHILD AS THE APPEARANCE OF AN ANGEL
QUICK
DURING THE FOUR HOURS OF DAYLIGHT THAT STILL REMAINED THE TRAVELERS RODE ABOUT TWENTY-ONE MILES FROM THE RIVER MOUTH
ON THE ONE HAND THE JEW TOOK IT INTO ACCOUNT THAT ALTHOUGH THE CHANCES OF RETURNING TO THE EARTH MIGHT BE REMOTE YET FROM WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE PROFESSOR HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE IMPROBABLE
TELL ME HAVE YOU OR HAVE YOU NOT CIRCUMNAVIGATED GALLIA THE LIEUTENANT DREW HIMSELF UP STIFFLY
TWO OR THREE STOOLS AND A RICKETY DEAL TABLE TOGETHER WITH A FEW COOKING UTENSILS COMPLETED A STOCK OF FURNITURE WHICH WAS WORTHY OF ITS PROPRIETOR
FROM TIME TO TIME THEY CAME UPON LARGE EXCAVATIONS THAT AT FIRST SIGHT HAD ALL THE APPEARANCE OF GALLERIES BUT BY WAVING HIS TORCH BEN ZOOF COULD ALWAYS SEE THEIR EXTREME LIMITS AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE LOWER STRATA OF THE MOUNTAIN DID NOT PRESENT THE SAME SYSTEM OF RAMIFICATION THAT RENDERED THE HIVE ABOVE SO COMMODIOUS A RESIDENCE
THE FELLOWS ARE CHICKEN-HEARTED ENOUGH ALREADY
BUT BY ALL THE WINES OF MEDOC I AM PUZZLED
YES COLONEL
NO SIR
OR IN THE EVENT OF THE SOUTHERN SHORE HAVING ACTUALLY DISAPPEARED THEY WOULD MAKE THEIR WAY NORTHWARDS AND PUT THEMSELVES IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE POPULATION ON THE RIVER BANKS OF EUROPE
MUTUAL INTEREST AND NECESSITY THUS CONSPIRED TO DRAW HAKKABUT AND THE CAPTAIN TOGETHER
THAT IT REACHED ITS PERIHELION ON THE 15TH
COUNT TIMASCHEFF COULD NOT FORBEAR PRESSING HIS TWO BRAVE FRIENDS TO HIS BOSOM
THE CAPTAIN STAMPED AND STAMPED AGAIN WITH MINGLED VEXATION AGITATION AND BEWILDERMENT
AS THE YACHT APPROACHED THE SHORE THIS CLOUD APPEARED TO RISE AND FALL AS IF ACTED UPON BY SOME INVISIBLE AGENCY AND THE CAPTAIN AFTER WATCHING IT CAREFULLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NOT AN ACCUMULATION OF VAPORS AT ALL BUT A DENSE MASS OF BIRDS PACKED AS CLOSELY TOGETHER AS A SWARM OF HERRINGS AND UTTERING DEAFENING AND DISCORDANT CRIES AMIDST WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME THE NOISE OF THE REPORT OF A GUN COULD BE PLAINLY DISTINGUISHED
FULLY ALIVE TO THE HOPELESSNESS OF THEIR SITUATION THE CREW WERE ALL ON DECK
BEN ZOOF YOU IDIOT
110,000,000 L
NOT ONLY DID HE AT ONCE RECOGNIZE THAT A COLLISION WITH THE EARTH WAS POSSIBLE BUT HE SOON FORESAW THAT IT WAS INEVITABLE AND THAT IT MUST HAPPEN ON THE NIGHT OF THE 31ST OF DECEMBER
A SUDDEN THRILL SEEMED TO VIBRATE ACROSS THE MOTIONLESS WATERS TO THE DISTANT HORIZON AND THE GALLIAN SEA HAD BECOME A SOLID SHEET OF ICE
NO WELL-DEFINED FRINGE OF LIGHT NOR ARCH OF LUMINOUS RAYS BETOKENED A DISPLAY OF AURORA BOREALIS EVEN HAD SUCH A PHENOMENON BEEN POSSIBLE IN THESE LATITUDES
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WAS WELL AWARE TO WHAT MARVELOUS PERFECTION THE AMERICANS HAD BROUGHT THEIR SAIL-SLEDGES AND HAD HEARD HOW IN THE VAST PRAIRIES OF THE UNITED STATES THEY HAD BEEN KNOWN TO OUTVIE THE SPEED OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN OCCASIONALLY ATTAINING A RATE OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR
SOME HOURS WERE SPENT IN DISCUSSION AND IN ATTEMPTING TO PENETRATE THE MYSTERIES OF THE SITUATION
BUT BEN ZOOF FAILED TO SEE THAT EVEN AT THE WORST THE CATASTROPHE COULD BE MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN THE COLLISION OF TWO RAILWAY TRAINS
BUT WHAT A MULTITUDE OF BEWILDERING SPECULATIONS IT ENTAILED
IF YOU MAKE THE LEAST ATTEMPT TO DISTURB OUR VISITOR I SHALL HAVE YOU TURNED OUTSIDE THAT DOOR IMMEDIATELY NO OFFENSE MY LORD I HOPE STAMMERED OUT THE JEW
ONLY WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO GET ME A PROPER PLACE FOR STUDY I WILL AS I PROMISED DO ALL I CAN ANSWERED SERVADAC
WE CAN NOW ARRIVE AT GALLIA'S ATTRACTION DENSITY AND MASS EVERYONE GAVE HIM HIS COMPLETE ATTENTION
LEAVING THE DEVIOUS WINDINGS OF THE FOOTPATH THEY WENT AS A CROW WOULD FLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY
BUT DO PLEASE--DO PLEASE LET ME IN SUPPLICATED THE JEW
HE COULD UNDERSTAND THAT AN ALTERED INCLINATION OF THE EARTH'S AXIS WITH REGARD TO THE ECLIPTIC WOULD INTRODUCE A CHANGE OF POSITION IN THE CARDINAL POINTS AND BRING ABOUT A DISPLACEMENT OF THE SEA
OH YOUR EXCELLENCY CRIED THE JEW
CAN IT BE A SHIP ASKED THE CAPTAIN
AND WHERE WERE YOU ASKED MAJOR OLIPHANT
ITS GARDENS OF CITRONS AND ORANGES RISING TIER UPON TIER FROM THE DEEP RED SOIL--ALL ALL HAD VANISHED
YOU ARE AT GIBRALTAR REPLIED THE COLONEL
FURIOUS AT THE SLIGHT THE PROFESSOR RESOLVED TO SET TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AND DECLARING THAT THERE WERE INACCURACIES IN THE PREVIOUS GEODESIC OPERATIONS HE DETERMINED TO RE-EXAMINE THE RESULTS OF THE LAST TRIANGULATION WHICH HAD UNITED FORMENTERA TO THE SPANISH COAST BY A TRIANGLE ONE OF THE SIDES OF WHICH MEASURED OVER A HUNDRED MILES THE VERY OPERATION WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN SO SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED BY ARAGO AND BIOT
AND EVEN IF IT BE OUR FATE NEVER AGAIN TO BEHOLD OUR FELLOW CREATURES I HAVE NO MISGIVINGS BUT THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO COPE WITH WHATEVER DIFFICULTIES MAY BE BEFORE US AS HE SPOKE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
OLD ISAAC STAMMERED AND STUTTERED BUT AT LAST CONFESSED THAT PERHAPS THERE MIGHT BE ONE AMONGST THE STORES
THEY HAD HAD THEIR WARNING AND MUST NOW TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR OWN INCREDULITY
THE LAUNCH SECURELY MOORED THE PASSENGERS LANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE PROMONTORY OPPOSITE TO THAT ON WHICH A TORRENT OF BURNING LAVA WAS DESCENDING TO THE SEA
HE WAS DRIVEN THEREFORE TO THE ESTIMATE OF THE MEASURE IN WHICH THE EARTH MUST HAVE APPROXIMATED TO THE SUN A DEDUCTION IN WHICH HE WAS CONFIRMED WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY CAME FOR HIM TO OBSERVE VENUS HERSELF IN THE SPLENDID PROPORTIONS THAT SHE NOW ASSUMED
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT CONTINUED THE CAPTAIN--"YOU SHALL HAVE A FEW MEN TO WORK THE HANSA ACROSS IF YOU LIKE BUT I WANT TO GO TO ALGIERS WHIMPERED HAKKABUT
HELP HELP
HE GREW MORE AND MORE IMPRESSED WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF FINDING OUT THE EXACT MOMENT AT WHICH THE IMPACT WOULD TAKE PLACE BUT WAS CONTENT TO WAIT FOR A PROMISING OPPORTUNITY TO PUT ANY FRESH QUESTIONS ON THE SUBJECT TO THE TOO RETICENT ASTRONOMER
ON ENTERING THE CABIN BEN ZOOF'S FIRST PROCEEDING WAS TO THROW ON THE FIRE A LIBERAL SUPPLY OF COALS UTTERLY REGARDLESS OF THE GROANS OF POOR ISAAC WHO WOULD ALMOST AS SOON HAVE PARTED WITH HIS OWN BONES AS SUBMIT TO SUCH RECKLESS EXPENDITURE OF HIS FUEL
SATISFIED UPON THIS POINT THEY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ERUPTION WHICH HAD SO SUDDENLY CEASED IN ONE SPOT HAD CERTAINLY BROKEN OUT IN ANOTHER
AND THUS MOCHEL THE DOBRYNA'S COOK WAS FURNISHED WITH AN ADMIRABLE KITCHEN PROVIDED WITH A PERMANENT STOVE WHERE HE WAS DULY INSTALLED WITH ALL HIS CULINARY APPARATUS
A FLIGHT OF STEPS RECENTLY HEWN BY HAKKABUT HIMSELF GAVE ACCESS FOR THE PRESENT TO THE GANGWAY BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOME DIFFERENT CONTRIVANCE WOULD HAVE TO BE RESORTED TO WHEN THE TARTAN SHOULD BE ELEVATED PERHAPS TO A HUNDRED FEET
ALTHOUGH EQUALLY BY NIGHT AND BY DAY HE NEVER SEEMED TO QUIT HIS TELESCOPE HE DID NOT EVINCE THE SLIGHTEST INCLINATION TO IMPART THE RESULT OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
SINCE LEAVING THE MILITARY COLLEGE SERVADAC WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIS TWO CAMPAIGNS IN THE SOUDAN AND JAPAN HAD BEEN ALWAYS STATIONED IN ALGERIA
ON THE 13TH CROSSED THE ORBIT OF MARS
AND THAT THEORY BEING ABANDONED THEY WERE DRIVEN TO MAKE THE MOST IMPROBABLE SPECULATIONS TO REPLACE IT
THE RESIDUUM OF A CONTINENT ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY THE VOYAGERS IN THE DOBRYNA FELL INTO THE HABIT OF USING GALLIA AS THE NAME OF THE NEW WORLD IN WHICH THEY BECAME AWARE THEY MUST BE MAKING AN EXTRAORDINARY EXCURSION THROUGH THE REALMS OF SPACE
TWICE THRICE DID THE SOUND REPEAT ITSELF
BEFORE EVENING THEY HAD REACHED THE MEDITERRANEAN
PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH COLLEGE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK
I AM RESOLVED TO FIND OUT WHAT MY COMET WEIGHS WOULD IT NOT BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE IF WE KNEW OF WHAT SUBSTANCE IT IS COMPOSED ASKED THE LIEUTENANT
THE SPANIARDS WERE IN THE BEST OF SPIRITS
ONLY LET US ESCAPE JUPITER SAID LIEUTENANT PROCOPE REPEATEDLY AND WE ARE FREE FROM ANXIETY BUT WOULD NOT SATURN LIE AHEAD ASKED SERVADAC AND THE COUNT IN ONE BREATH
SHUFFLINGS
CHAPTER XV
IT WAS SURPRISING HOW CALMLY THEY PROCEEDED TO DISCUSS THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LOOKED SO THREATENING AND OMINOUS
THERE WAS NOTHING TO JUSTIFY APPREHENSION
WHAT IS THE FORCE OF GRAVITY UPON THE VARIOUS PLANETS YOU CAN'T MEAN SERVADAC THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT
LIKE MANY OTHER MODERN PLEASURE-YACHTS THE DOBRYNA IN ADDITION TO HER FOUR-OAR WAS FITTED WITH A FAST-GOING LITTLE STEAM-LAUNCH ITS SCREW BEING PROPELLED ON THE ORIOLLE SYSTEM BY MEANS OF A BOILER SMALL BUT VERY EFFECTIVE
THE ORDERLY SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT AFTER A FEW MOMENTS PONDERING SAID
WHAT HOPE COULD THEY ENTERTAIN THAT ANY PORTION OF THE OLD CONTINENT STILL EXISTED BEYOND THAT DREARY BARRIER
BEN ZOOF'S FIRST CARE ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING WAS TO PROVIDE A GOOD BREAKFAST
BUT THEIR FORMER RECEPTION HAD NOT BEEN OF THE KINDEST AND THEY WERE LITTLE DISPOSED TO RENEW AN ACQUAINTANCESHIP THAT WAS MARKED BY SO LITTLE CORDIALITY
THEY TOOK WHAT MUTUAL COUNSEL THEY COULD BUT BECAME ONLY MORE AND MORE PERPLEXED
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS ASKED THE COUNT
THE CONDITION OF THE CEREALS WAS SUCH AS TO PROMISE A FINE INGATHERING OF WHEAT MAIZE AND RICE
BEN ZOOF REALLY THINKING THAT HIS MASTER WAS ANGRY MADE A THREATENING MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE PROFESSOR
AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY DECIDED AGAINST THE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PROFESSOR
AND THEREFORE THE CAPTAIN CAME AS TO AN EASIER CONCLUSION TO THE OPINION THAT THE EARTH'S AXIS HAD BEEN SUDDENLY AND IMMENSELY SHIFTED
ARE YOU SATISFIED OLD EZEKIEL HE ASKED
TELL ME HAKKABUT THE STEELYARD LIES
BUT HE HAD FAILED TO REALIZE HOW IT MIGHT EXTEND TO FRANCE
TELL YOU THE TRUTH MAN CRIED SERVADAC
ONLY LET HIM ONCE REALIZE THAT HE IS ON A NEW GLOBE WITH NO PROSPECT OF GETTING BACK TO THE OLD ONE AND HE WILL BE READY ENOUGH TO COME TO TERMS WITH US PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT
HUMAN PRECAUTIONS CANNOT SWAY THE DIVINE WILL BUT WITH THE MOST PROFOUND REVERENCE FOR THE WILL OF PROVIDENCE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN I BEG TO SUBMIT THAT IT IS OUR DUTY TO DEVISE WHATEVER MEANS WE CAN TO ESCAPE THE THREATENING MISCHIEF
THE ATMOSPHERE REMAINED CLEAR AS HERETOFORE
IF A NEW LITTLE PLANET HAS BEEN FORMED AS I IMAGINE BY DISINTEGRATION FROM THE OLD I SHOULD CONJECTURE THAT GALLIA IS THE NAME ASSIGNED TO IT BY THE WRITER OF THIS PAPER
ON THE 7TH OF OCTOBER THE COMET RE-ENTERED THE ZONE OF THE TELESCOPIC PLANETS ONE OF WHICH HAD BEEN CAPTURED AS A SATELLITE AND THE ORIGIN OF THE WHOLE OF WHICH IS MOST PROBABLY CORRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE DISINTEGRATION OF SOME LARGE PLANET THAT FORMERLY REVOLVED BETWEEN THE ORBITS OF MARS AND JUPITER
WE SHALL KNOW NOTHING UNTIL TO-MORROW WHAT
AND DON'T YOU THINK THE GOVERNOR OUGHT TO LET ME HAVE IT NO DOUBT OH I MUST HAVE COFFEE SAID THE JEW AGAIN
THE PROFESSOR'S EXPERIENCES YES MY COMET REPEATED THE PROFESSOR AND FROM TIME TO TIME HE KNITTED HIS BROWS AND LOOKED AROUND HIM WITH A DEFIANT AIR AS THOUGH HE COULD NOT GET RID OF THE IMPRESSION THAT SOMEONE WAS LAYING AN UNWARRANTED CLAIM TO ITS PROPRIETORSHIP OR THAT THE INDIVIDUALS BEFORE HIM WERE INTRUDERS UPON HIS OWN PROPER DOMAIN
HAKKABUT DID NOT SAY A WORD
THE PROFESSOR SCOWLED AT HIM AND WAS MANIFESTLY ANNOYED AT HAVING THE INSIGNIFICANT DIMENSIONS OF HIS COMET POINTED OUT IN SO DISPARAGING A MANNER
ALTHOUGH NO ONE OF ALL THE COMMUNITY CARED AT ALL FOR THE SAFETY OF THE JEW THEY CARED VERY MUCH FOR THE SECURITY OF HIS CARGO AND WHEN SERVADAC FOUND THAT NOTHING WOULD INDUCE THE OLD MAN TO ABANDON HIS PRESENT QUARTERS VOLUNTARILY HE VERY SOON ADOPTED MEASURES OF COERCION THAT WERE FAR MORE EFFECTUAL THAN ANY REPRESENTATIONS OF PERSONAL DANGER
I MUST REFER THE MATTER TO HIS EXCELLENCY OH HIS EXCELLENCY WILL DO ME JUSTICE PERHAPS YOU WILL FIND HIS JUSTICE RATHER TOO MUCH FOR YOU AND WITH THIS CONSOLING REMARK THE ORDERLY WENT TO SEEK HIS MASTER
HOW
HOW
WHAT IF THIS SEA WAS NO LONGER THE MEDITERRANEAN
BUT WHETHER IT WAS ONE OF THE 169 ASTEROIDS ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE ASTRONOMICAL CATALOGUES OR ONE PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN HE DID NOT PRESUME TO DETERMINE
LIEUTENANT HE SAID YOUR EXPLANATION IS INGENIOUS AND ACCOUNTS FOR MANY APPEARANCES
A CHALLENGE NOTHING SIR CAN INDUCE ME TO SURRENDER MY CLAIM I AM SORRY COUNT BUT IN SUCH A MATTER YOUR VIEWS CANNOT MODIFY MINE BUT ALLOW ME TO POINT OUT THAT MY SENIORITY UNQUESTIONABLY GIVES ME A PRIOR RIGHT MERE SENIORITY I ASSERT IN AN AFFAIR OF THIS KIND CANNOT POSSIBLY ENTITLE YOU TO ANY PRIOR CLAIM WHATEVER THEN CAPTAIN NO ALTERNATIVE IS LEFT BUT FOR ME TO COMPEL YOU TO YIELD AT THE SWORD'S POINT AS YOU PLEASE COUNT
BUT HECTOR SERVADAC ANIMATED BY THE GENEROUS DESIRE OF RESCUING A SUFFERING FELLOW-CREATURE COULD SCARCELY BE BROUGHT WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF COMMON SENSE
AND I LOOK UPON IT AS A MIRACLE AND NOTHING LESS THAT I AND MY CREW ESCAPED WITH OUR LIVES I CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR LUCK REPLIED THE MAJOR
THE MOST MEAGER OF ARCTIC PLANTS THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT OF LICHENS COULD OBTAIN NO HOLD UPON THAT STONY WASTE
THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS OF WHICH THEY WERE PERFECTLY CERTAIN
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE LEANED THROUGH THE APERTURE
SUDDENLY LITTLE NINA WHO HAD AGAIN TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE PIGEON AND WAS HUGGING IT TO HER BREAST SAID
DURING THE MONTH GALLIA'S ADVANCE ALONG ITS ORBIT WOULD BE REDUCED TO 22,000,000 LEAGUES THE DISTANCE FROM THE SUN AT THE END BEING 172,000,000 LEAGUES ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF TIMES AS GREAT AS THE AVERAGE DISTANCE OF THE EARTH FROM THE SUN
AND WITH THOSE ENGLISHMEN HOW HAD IT FARED
SHE HAD TAKEN ONLY FOUR DAYS TO PASS FROM SYZYGY TO QUADRATURE AND IT WAS CONSEQUENTLY EVIDENT THAT SHE WOULD BE VISIBLE FOR LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK AT A TIME AND THAT HER LUNATION WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN SIXTEEN DAYS
QUICK BOYS QUICK
IF THE JUST EQUILIBRIUM OF THE EARTH HAD THUS BEEN DESTROYED AND SHOULD THIS DIMINUTION OF DISTANCE STILL CONTINUE WOULD THERE NOT BE REASON TO FEAR THAT THE TERRESTRIAL WORLD WOULD BE CARRIED ONWARDS TO ACTUAL CONTACT WITH THE SUN WHICH MUST RESULT IN ITS TOTAL ANNIHILATION
IT IS MY IMPRESSION THAT IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY WE MAY RUN FOUL OF VENUS SAID THE CAPTAIN
NO TIME TO LOSE
IN HIS EAGERNESS TO EFFECT SALES HE HAD PARTED WITH ALL THE ALIMENTARY ARTICLES IN HIS CARGO WITHOUT HAVING THE PRECAUTIONARY PRUDENCE TO RESERVE ENOUGH FOR HIS OWN CONSUMPTION
I HAVE TAKEN THE SAME COURSE AS I SHOULD HAVE DONE AT SEA AND I HAVE KEPT SOME DISTANCE TO WINDWARD OF THE ISLAND
CAPTAIN SERVADAC MOUNTED HIS HORSE ZEPHYR AND BEN ZOOF SIMULTANEOUSLY GOT ASTRIDE HIS MARE GALETTE NAMED AFTER THE MILL OF MONTMARTRE
THIS PARTIAL REVIVAL WAS PROBABLY DUE TO THE SOMEWHAT INCREASED INFLUENCE OF THE SUN STILL FAR FAR AWAY
HENCE TO THE GULF OF CABES HAD BEEN ALREADY EXPLORED AND AS IT WAS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED THAT IT WAS UNNECESSARY TO RENEW THE SEARCH IN THAT DIRECTION THE LIEUTENANT STARTED OFF IN A TRANSVERSE COURSE TOWARDS A POINT HITHERTO UNINVESTIGATED
BEN ZOOF SAID NO MORE
THE LIGHT ALSO DIMINISHED IN PROPORTION AND ALL OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE ENVELOPED IN A HALF-DEFINED SHADOW AS THOUGH THE SUN WERE UNDERGOING A PERPETUAL ECLIPSE
IT COINCIDED PRETTY NEARLY WITH THE FOURTEENTH MERIDIAN OF EAST LONGITUDE
IT WAS THE EXPERIENCE OF PARRY UPON MELVILLE ISLAND OF KANE BEYOND LATITUDE 81 DEGREES NORTH AND OF HALL AND THE CREW OF THE POLARIS THAT HOWEVER INTENSE THE COLD IN THE ABSENCE OF THE WIND THEY COULD ALWAYS BRAVE ITS RIGOR
IF THE WATER FREEZES 120 LEAGUES IS NO VERY GREAT DISTANCE
VERY PECULIAR REPLIED THE MAJOR
AND CAPTAIN SERVADAC WAS PERPETUALLY REGRETTING THAT THEY COULD RECEIVE NO FURTHER TIDINGS FROM THE ANONYMOUS CORRESPONDENT WHOM HE PERSISTED IN REGARDING AS A FELLOW-COUNTRYMAN
TOWARDS THE NORTH ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE BEYOND A QUARTER OF A MILE THE UPPER STRATA OF THE ATMOSPHERE WERE SUFFUSED WITH A ROSY GLARE
MILE AFTER MILE THE DISTANCE RAPIDLY GREW LESS AND AS THEY DREW NEARER THE PYLONE THEY COULD SEE THAT IT WAS ERECTED ON A LOW MASS OF ROCKS THAT WAS THE SOLE INTERRUPTION TO THE DULL LEVEL OF THE FIELD OF ICE
AND IF SUFFERED TO TAKE THEIR COURSE WITHOUT OBSERVATION HIS OUTBREAKS OF ILL-TEMPER SELDOM LASTED LONG
BY-THE-BY WHAT O'CLOCK IS IT ASKED THE CAPTAIN
THE JEW STAMMERED AGAIN AND BEGAN TO OBJECT
HE REPEATED ALL THAT HE HAD SAID AND BY INTRODUCING SOME ILLUSTRATIONS FROM FAMILIAR THINGS HE SUCCEEDED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IN CONVEYING SOME FAINT IDEA OF THE CONVULSION THAT HAD HAPPENED
IT IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT THAT WATER UNDER THIS CONDITION OF ABSOLUTE STILLNESS WILL REMAIN UNCONGEALED AT A TEMPERATURE SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW ZERO WHILST EXPERIMENT AT THE SAME TIME SHOWS THAT A VERY SLIGHT SHOCK WILL OFTEN BE SUFFICIENT TO CONVERT IT INTO SOLID ICE
A FROZEN OCEAN THE MOON
FOR MY PART I SHALL BE QUITE WARM ENOUGH HERE AFTER THROWING THE GLEAMS OF TORCH-LIGHT IN ALL DIRECTIONS THE EXPLORERS SEATED THEMSELVES ON A JUTTING ROCK AND BEGAN TO DEBATE WHETHER IT WAS PRACTICABLE FOR THE COLONY TO MAKE AN ABODE IN THESE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE MOUNTAIN
GOURBI ISLAND WAS JUST AS HE HAD LEFT IT WITH NOTHING UNUSUAL IN ITS ASPECT EXCEPT THAT A VERY PECULIAR CLOUD WAS HOVERING OVER IT AT AN ALTITUDE OF LITTLE MORE THAN A HUNDRED FEET
DEPOSIT IN GOLD MONEY A HUNDRED FRANCS AND TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE HIRE THE OLD MAN FOLDED HIS HANDS IN MEEK RESIGNATION
HOW SAID COUNT TIMASCHEFF
BUT EVEN THIS PEAK WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO EMERGE LIKE AN ISLET ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SEA WAS NOWHERE TO BE TRACED
THE REQUEST HAVING BEEN GRANTED PIM WITH THE NINE SOLDIERS ALL PUNCTILIOUSLY WEARING THE REGIMENTAL TUNIC OF SCARLET AND TROUSERS OF INVISIBLE GREEN PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE DOOR OF THE COLONEL'S ROOM WHERE HE AND HIS BROTHER-OFFICER WERE CONTINUING THEIR GAME
COLONEL MURPHY AND THE MAJOR HAD NOT EVEN BEEN FORCED TO FOREGO THE PLEASURES OF THE CHESSBOARD
THE FIRST NIGHT IN NINA'S HIVE PASSED WITHOUT SPECIAL INCIDENT
THE HYPOTHESIS TO WHICH THEY HAD NOW ACCUSTOMED THEMSELVES FOR SO LONG THAT A NEW ASTEROID HAD BEEN FORMED BY A FRACTURE OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE SEEMED TO FALL TO THE GROUND WHEN THEY FOUND THAT PROFESSOR PALMYRIN ROSETTE HAD ASSOCIATED THE NAME OF GALLIA NOT WITH THEIR PRESENT HOME BUT WITH WHAT HE CALLED MY COMET
BEN ZOOF AS THE FIRST OBSERVER OF THE SATELLITE WAS EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN ITS MOVEMENTS AND WONDERED WHETHER IT WOULD EVER REAPPEAR
WITHOUT DOING MORE THAN NOTE THE CIRCUMSTANCE SERVADAC TURNED HIS ENTIRE ATTENTION TO THE DOBRYNA WHICH NOW LITTLE MORE THAN A MILE FROM SHORE COULD NOT FAIL TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND HIS SIGNALS
BUT WHEN IT HAD BECOME HIS LOT TO BE THE PURCHASER INSTEAD OF THE VENDOR HIS SPIRIT HAD GROANED WITHIN HIM AT BEING COMPELLED TO REAP THE FRUITS OF HIS OWN DISHONESTY
MUST THERE NOT HAVE BEEN A CUSTODIAN OF THE SHRINE THEY MUTUALLY ASKED
SOMETHING MORE YOU MUST LEND ME HE SAID ADDRESSING THE JEW
AFTER ALL THEY WERE BUT MAKING A VOYAGE--A STRANGE YET A TRANSIENT EXCURSION THROUGH SOLAR REGIONS HITHERTO UNTRAVERSED
IF UPON TERRA FIRMA WOULD IT BE IN A PLACE WHERE ADEQUATE RESOURCES FOR SAFETY WOULD BE AT HAND
A REVISED CALENDAR ALL PREVIOUS HYPOTHESES THEN WERE NOW FORGOTTEN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ONE GREAT FACT THAT GALLIA WAS A COMET AND GRAVITATING THROUGH REMOTE SOLAR REGIONS
THIS SOIL IS OF A SUBSTANCE NOT UNKNOWN UPON THE EARTH AND SPEAKING VERY SLOWLY THE PROFESSOR SAID
BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF MOONLIGHT THE CONSTELLATIONS SHONE WITH REMARKABLE BRILLIANCY
A PROLONGED EXISTENCE IN THEIR UNDERGROUND QUARTERS WAS FELT TO BE MONOTONOUS AND DEPRESSING AND ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE ALL VERY WELL FOR A MAN LIKE PROFESSOR ROSETTE ABSORBED IN ASTRONOMICAL STUDIES IT WAS ILL SUITED TO THE TEMPERAMENTS OF ANY OF THEMSELVES FOR ANY LONGER PERIOD THAN WAS ABSOLUTELY INDISPENSABLE
ALL AT ONCE HE BEGAN TO SHOW A REMARKABLE INTEREST IN THE JEW AND HIS AFFAIRS PAYING SEVERAL VISITS TO THE DARK LITTLE STOREHOUSE MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO THE STATE OF BUSINESS AND EXPRESSING SOME SOLICITUDE ABOUT THE STATE OF THE EXCHEQUER
YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNT WILL YOU NOT MY YACHT IS AT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRE TO MAKE A TOUR ROUND THE WORLD A TOUR ROUND THE MEDITERRANEAN WILL SUFFICE FOR THE PRESENT I THINK SAID THE CAPTAIN SMILING
NEVER EVEN IN THE SECOND ERA OF CREATION WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF INTERNAL HEAT THE WATERS ROSE IN VAPOR TO DESCEND IN DELUGE BACK UPON THE WORLD COULD METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED WITH MORE IMPRESSIVE INTENSITY
HE HOPED MOREOVER THAT THE SCARCITY OF HIS COMMODITIES WOULD SECURE VERY HIGH PRICES
IT IS NOT TO BE QUESTIONED THAT THEY WERE DEEPLY AFFECTED BY A SENSE OF REGRET FOR THEIR LOST COMRADES AND ASTOUNDED BEYOND MEASURE AT FINDING THEMSELVES THE SOLE SURVIVORS OF A GARRISON OF 1,895 MEN BUT WITH TRUE BRITISH PLUCK AND SELF-CONTROL THEY HAD DONE NOTHING MORE THAN DRAW UP A REPORT THAT 1,882 NAMES WERE MISSING FROM THE MUSTER-ROLL
THE RUSSIANS AND SPANIARDS AMALGAMATED WELL AND BOTH DID THEIR BEST TO PICK UP VARIOUS SCRAPS OF FRENCH WHICH WAS CONSIDERED THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF THE PLACE
THE INSTRUMENT IS VERY VALUABLE AND HE LOOKED MORE CUNNING THAN EVER
AND HIS MIND AGAIN REVERTED TO THE EXCURSION MADE BY THE COLONEL AND THE MAJOR FROM GIBRALTAR ABOUT WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SO RETICENT
FORTY-SIX MINUTES ANNOUNCED THE LIEUTENANT
HERE THE SEA MADE A DECIDED INDENTATION ON THE COAST
I AM VERY SORRY AND THIS TIME THE OLD JEW SPOKE THE TRUTH
INSOLENCE RETORTED SERVADAC
TELL ME HAKKABUT I SAY REPEATED SERVADAC
ABOVE AND BELOW WERE A FEW LEDGES IN THE ROCK THAT WOULD SERVE AS RECEPTACLES FOR PROVISIONS
THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY HOWEVER BY NO MEANS SYMPATHIZED WITH THE PROFESSOR'S SENTIMENTS AND THE FOLLOWING MONTH WAS A PERIOD OF CONSIDERABLE DOUBT AND ANXIETY
TIME PASSED ON
BUT HIS ADVANCES WERE ONLY MET BY JEERS AND SCORN AND RIDICULED BY ALL THE REST HE WAS FAIN TO TURN HIS ATTENTION TO BEN ZOOF TO WHOM HE OFFERED A FEW PINCHES OF TOBACCO
CHAPTER VIII
AND THE COMET WAS 220,000,000 LEAGUES FROM THE SUN
HURRAH FOR ENGLAND REPLIED THE SOLDIER
ROSETTE THUS FOUND HIMSELF ABLE TO CALCULATE THE DATE AT WHICH THE COMET WOULD REACH ITS PERIHELION AND OVERJOYED AT HIS DISCOVERY WITHOUT THINKING OF CALLING IT PALMYRA OR ROSETTE AFTER HIS OWN NAME HE RESOLVED THAT IT SHOULD BE KNOWN AS GALLIA
NOT ONLY HAS MALTA BEEN ENTIRELY LOST BUT OF THE IONIAN ISLANDS THAT WERE UNDER ENGLAND'S PROTECTION THERE SEEMS TO BE BUT LITTLE LEFT AY YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT SAID SERVADAC BREAKING IN UPON THE CONVERSATION PETULANTLY YOUR GRAND RESIDENT LORD HIGH COMMISSIONER HAS NOT MUCH TO CONGRATULATE HIMSELF ABOUT IN THE CONDITION OF CORFU THE ENGLISHMEN WERE MYSTIFIED
TO USE HIS OWN PHRASE HE WAS AS HUNGRY AS THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THREE MILLION ALGERIANS OF WHOM HE WAS THE REPRESENTATIVE AND HE MUST HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT
AND JUST NOW WHEN GALLIA WAS ENTERING THE NARROW ZONE OF SHOOTING-STARS AND NEW DISCOVERIES MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITHIN HIS REACH HIS LOSS MADE HIM MORE INCONSOLABLE THAN EVER
BUT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE EXPLORERS UNEXPECTEDLY SIGHTED A LITTLE ISLAND WHICH UNLESS IT SHOULD PROVE AS WAS ONLY TOO LIKELY TO BE OF RECENT ORIGIN THEY CONCLUDED FROM ITS SITUATION MUST BE A PORTION OF THE NORTHERNMOST TERRITORY OF SARDINIA
THEY PROVIDED A VARIETY OF INTELLECTUAL PURSUITS
DO YOU NOT SEE THEN CONTINUED THE ASTRONOMER THAT IF A GALLIAN MONTH IS TWICE AS LONG AS A TERRESTRIAL MONTH AND A GALLIAN DAY IS ONLY HALF AS LONG AS A TERRESTRIAL DAY THERE MUST BE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS IN EVERY MONTH NO DOUBT YOU ARE RIGHT PROFESSOR SAID COUNT TIMASCHEFF
FOR ALTHOUGH A RETURN OF THE ERUPTION MIGHT HAVE RENDERED THEIR FORMER RESORT AGAIN HABITABLE ANY SUDDEN OUTBREAK WOULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS TO THEM WHERE THEY WERE THE CRATER BEING THE SOLE OUTLET BY WHICH THE BURNING LAVA COULD ESCAPE
HE KEPT EXCLAIMING THAT HE HAD GIVEN NO ORDERS THAT HE WAS BEING MOVED AGAINST HIS WILL THAT HE HAD ASKED FOR NO ASSISTANCE AND NEEDED NONE
SMALL AND SKINNY WITH EYES BRIGHT AND CUNNING A HOOKED NOSE A SHORT YELLOW BEARD UNKEMPT HAIR HUGE FEET AND LONG BONY HANDS HE PRESENTED ALL THE TYPICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GERMAN JEW THE HEARTLESS WILY USURER THE HARDENED MISER AND SKINFLINT
SERVADAC GAZED UPON THE SHATTERED MARBLE PENSIVE AND DISHEARTENED
YOU WILL GET YOUR SEVEN POUNDS INSTEAD OF ONE YES
I AM AFRAID THEY WILL SPOIL US PABLO SHE ADDED SMILING
THE STARS FIXED AND IMMOVABLE IN NAME ARE ALL OF THEM IN MOTION AND GALLIA MIGHT HAVE FOLLOWED THEM IN THEIR UN-TRACKED WAY
HOT AIR WILL BE ALL THAT WE SHALL REQUIRE THE LIEUTENANT ANSWERED
HECTOR SERVADAC WAS INFLEXIBLE
HAVE YOU HAD COMMUNICATIONS WITH EUROPE
I HOPE WE ARE NOT GOING TO FIGHT NO NOT WITH MEN SAID BEN ZOOF
IF THAT'S A TELEGRAPH--AND THERE IS NO DOUBT OF IT--SOMEBODY HAS BEEN BEFORE US AND ERECTED IT
SERVADAC SURVEYED HIM LEISURELY
LOUD AND HEARTY WERE THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THE LITTLE COLONY ESPECIALLY OF THE SPANIARDS AND GREAT WAS THE RELIEF OF NINA WHEN SERVADAC ANNOUNCED TO THEM THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR FUTURE DOMICILE
TO SPAIN ECHOED ISAAC HAKKABUT WITH A HIDEOUS YELL
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME ALL THE INFORMATION I REQUIRED AND WITH A LOW BOW AND A GRACIOUS SMILE THE CAPTAIN WITHDREW
EUREKA
EUREKA
THE BELTS THEMSELVES WERE OCCASIONALLY BROKEN BY SPOTS WHICH THE RECORDS OF ASTRONOMY DESCRIBE AS VARYING BOTH IN FORM AND IN EXTENT
THE LENGTH OF DAY REDUCED ONE HALF
IN THE APPARENT DIMENSIONS OF THE FIXED STARS IN THEIR DISTANCE IN THEIR RELATIVE POSITION WITH REGARD TO EACH OTHER HE COULD OBSERVE NO CHANGE
IT WOULD NEVER DO TO LEND ANY MONEY TO HIM
LET US SEE WHERE IT WILL LEAD US
THEN SEEMED TO CREEP OVER EVERYONE A KIND OF MORAL TORPOR AS WELL AS PHYSICAL LASSITUDE WHICH SERVADAC THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT DID THEIR BEST NOT ONLY TO COMBAT IN THEMSELVES BUT TO COUNTERACT IN THE GENERAL COMMUNITY
THE SKY ABOVE THEM WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR
NOT A CLOUD DIMMED THE LUSTER OF THE STARS WHICH SPANGLED THE HEAVENS IN SURPASSING BRILLIANCY AND SEVERAL NEBULAE WHICH HITHERTO NO ASTRONOMER HAD BEEN ABLE TO DISCERN WITHOUT THE AID OF A TELESCOPE WERE CLEARLY VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE
LESS AND LESS GREW THE DISTANCE FROM THE SHORE BUT NO CREEK NO INLET COULD BE DISCERNED IN THE TOWERING WALL OF CLIFF WHICH SEEMED ABOUT TO TOPPLE OVER AND INVOLVE THEM IN ANNIHILATION
SINCE THE DAY HE HAD DONE HIS LUCKY STROKE OF BUSINESS HE HAD NEVER LEFT THE TARTAN
BUT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL RECESS THAT MUST BE RESERVED FOR NINA IT WAS CLEAR THAT HENCEFORTH THEY MUST ALL RENOUNCE THE IDEA OF HAVING SEPARATE APARTMENTS
YOU KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH OLD SHECHEM SAID BEN ZOOF
IT HAS GONE JUST AS UTTERLY AS IF IT HAD BELONGED TO CHINA COLONEL MURPHY TURNED DELIBERATELY AWAY FROM SERVADAC AND APPEALED TO THE COUNT
GOD OF ISRAEL HE EJACULATED SELL MY STEELYARD
HE WENT SHAMBLING ALONG HALF WHIMPERING AND NOT UNFREQUENTLY INVOKING THE GOD OF ISRAEL
ON CONSULTING THEIR BOOKS OF REFERENCE THE COLONISTS FOUND THAT SATURN COMPLETES HIS REVOLUTION ROUND THE SUN IN A PERIOD OF 29 YEARS AND 167 DAYS TRAVELING AT THE RATE OF MORE THAN 21,000 MILES AN HOUR ALONG AN ORBIT MEASURING 5,490 MILLIONS OF MILES IN LENGTH
THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON TOO HAD BECOME MUCH CIRCUMSCRIBED
IT WAS NOT A TIME TO BE FASTIDIOUS
IT IS A CATASTROPHE THAT MAY HAVE VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES
EUREKA YELLED THE EXCITED ASTRONOMER
BUT ALTHOUGH THE WIND RAGED WITH AN ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE FURY IT WAS UNACCOMPANIED BY EITHER SNOW OR RAIN
AND THE CABLE IS BROKEN BUT DO NOT THE ITALIAN TELEGRAPHS ASSIST YOU CONTINUED THE COUNT
OH ENGLAND WILL ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF THAT WAS MAJOR OLIPHANT'S COOL REPLY
IT MUST OF NECESSITY BE ENTERED FROM THE INTERIOR
ONWARDS AND ONWARDS THE YACHT MADE HER WAY AND STILL NO SIGN OF FRANCE
THE DIAMETER OF THE SOLAR DISC WAS NOW EXACTLY TWICE WHAT IT ORDINARILY LOOKS TO THE NAKED EYE
OF ALL THESE SPOTS ONLY TWO WERE KNOWN TO BE INHABITED
THAT IT RE-CROSSED THE ORBIT OF VENUS
BUT NOW BESIDES ENJOYING THE SATISFACTION OF HAVING PUNISHED OLD HAKKABUT ROSETTE WAS ABLE TO RECOMMENCE HIS CALCULATIONS WITH REFERENCE TO THE ELEMENTS OF NERINA UPON A CORRECT BASIS A TASK TO WHICH HE DEVOTED HIMSELF WITH REDOUBLED ENERGY
A NEW MARVEL ARRESTED EVERY EYE
THE COLD NOW BECAME VERY INTENSE THE THERMOMETER REGISTERING 30 DEGREES F
THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO USE THE DOBRYNA WHILE SHE IS AVAILABLE AVAILABLE
THE COUNT AT ONCE PLACED HIS YACHT AT THEIR DISPOSAL AND EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF ACCOMPANYING THEM
HE POINTED OUT THAT BY THE CONSTANT SUPERPOSITION OF NEW DEPOSITS OF ICE THE VESSEL WOULD BE ELEVATED TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND CONSEQUENTLY IN THE EVENT OF A THAW IT MUST BE EXPOSED TO A CALAMITY SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH IN POLAR SEAS CAUSE DESTRUCTION TO SO MANY WHALERS
THEY OWE ME TWO HUNDRED REALS
I AM NOT GOING TO WASTE MY BREATH ON YOU
CHARMING LITTLE COMET
YOU FORGET SIR THAT YOU ARE ADDRESSING THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF GALLIA GOVERNOR-GENERAL
THERE WAS GOOD NEED OF THIS PRECAUTION FOR SO PRECIPITOUS WAS THE SHORE THAT A VESSEL DRIVEN UPON IT MUST INEVITABLY HAVE GONE TO PIECES
ISAAC HAKKABUT AFTER HIS INTRODUCTION BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO ASK ONE QUESTION
HANG IT HE EJACULATED WHATEVER INDUCED ME TO CHOOSE THIS METER
NEVER WAS A TASK UNDERTAKEN WITH GREATER ZEST
THE NEEDLE OSCILLATED AND STOPPED
THE CRISIS OF PERIL WAS CLOSE AT HAND BUT IMAGINATION OVERLEAPED ALL CONSIDERATION OF DANGER
IRREGULAR PATCHES OF GREATER OR LESS BRILLIANCY ALTERNATED ON ITS SURFACE THE BRIGHTER BETOKENING THE CONTINENTS THE MORE SOMBER INDICATING THE OCEANS THAT ABSORBED THE SOLAR RAYS
AFTER A LONG CONSULTATION THEY FAILED TO DEVISE ANY BETTER EXPEDIENT AND WERE FORCED TO RESIGN THEMSELVES TO THIS SPECIES OF TROGLODYTE EXISTENCE
IT IS TOO SOON TO GIVE UP
LAWS OF GRAVITY DISTURBED
THAT MEANS HE HAS MADE A DISCOVERY AND FULL OF ANXIETY HE HURRIED OFF TO MEET THE PROFESSOR
WITHOUT DELAY THEREFORE THEY ASSEMBLED IN THE CENTRAL HALL WHERE THEY WERE SOON JOINED BY ROSETTE WHO SEEMED TO BE IN FAIRLY GOOD TEMPER
NO CLEARING UP OF THE MYSTERY I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY OWN MIND SAID THE COUNT THAT IT IS ONE OF A SERIES
A POINTER REVOLVING ON A DISC INDICATED THE WEIGHT OF THE ARTICLE
HERE HAVE I FOR A WHOLE MONTH BEEN SPENDING MY POWDER AND SHOT UPON THEM AND THE MORE I KILL THEM THE WORSE THEY GET
AWARE THAT OLD ISAAC WAS AN UTTER HYPOCRITE HE HAD NO COMPUNCTION IN TURNING A BUSINESS TRANSACTION WITH HIM INTO AN OCCASION FOR A BIT OF FUN
ALTHOUGH HAKKABUT CLAMORED MOST VEHEMENTLY ABOUT HIS GOODS BEING CARRIED OFF AGAINST HIS WILL IN HIS HEART HE WAS MORE THAN SATISFIED TO SEE HIS PROPERTY TRANSFERRED TO A PLACE OF SAFETY AND DELIGHTED MOREOVER TO KNOW THAT THE TRANSPORT HAD BEEN EFFECTED WITHOUT A FARTHING OF EXPENSE TO HIMSELF
BUT PERHAPS THERE ARE ONLY FOUR OR FIVE ENGLISHMEN TO PROTECT THE PLACE SAID BEN ZOOF AS IF MEDITATING AN ASSAULT
DAY FOLLOWED DAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO CESSATION OF THE PROFESSOR'S DISCOMPOSURE
YOUNG PABLO MADE HIS FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH LITTLE NINA AND THE CHILD SEEMED HIGHLY DELIGHTED TO FIND A COMPANION SO NEARLY OF HER OWN AGE
IT STRIKES ME THAT THAT TELESCOPE WHICH THE OLD PROFESSOR KEEPS POINTED UP AT YONDER BIG SUN IS BRINGING IT DOWN STRAIGHT UPON US THE CAPTAIN LAUGHED HEARTILY
HIS PRIDE AND CONTENTMENT WERE BOTH OVERSHADOWED BY THE CERTAINTY THAT THE CAREER OF HIS COMET WAS DESTINED TO BE SO TRANSIENT AND THAT IT MUST INEVITABLY ONCE AGAIN COME INTO COLLISION WITH THE EARTH
AT FIRST CAPTAIN SERVADAC THOUGHT OF GOING IN PERSON WITH THE INVITATION
AFTER DRAINING IT WITH MUCH APPARENT RELISH THE PROFESSOR GOT OUT OF BED WALKED INTO THE COMMON HALL ROUND WHICH HE GLANCED WITH A PRE-OCCUPIED AIR AND PROCEEDED TO SEAT HIMSELF IN AN ARMCHAIR THE MOST COMFORTABLE WHICH THE CABIN OF THE DOBRYNA HAD SUPPLIED
AND THEY HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF TERRESTRIAL LONGITUDES IT MUST BE A WONDERFUL SIGHT SAID THE CAPTAIN
CHAPTER IX
BUT AFTER SAILING TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES THE PROGRESS OF THE DOBRYNA WAS SUDDENLY ARRESTED
IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE BEN ZOOF HAD READ A FEW BOOKS
NOW GENTLEMEN WE CAN PROCEED SAID THE PROFESSOR
THIS UNPRECEDENTED TEMPERATURE VERY SOON BEGAN TO TAKE EFFECT UPON THE PRODUCTS OF THE SOIL
AND FINALLY HOW THE SETTLEMENT AT GOURBI ISLAND HAD BEEN ABANDONED FOR THEIR PRESENT QUARTERS AT NINA'S HIVE
THE JEW TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT
THE COUNT ASSENTED BUT PROCOPE LOOKED DOUBTFUL
MAKING THEIR PROGRESS WITH THE UNWONTED RAPIDITY WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THEIR SPECIFIC LIGHTNESS SERVADAC AND HIS COMPANIONS SOON FOUND THEMSELVES NEAR A GROVE OF SYCAMORES AND EUCALYPTUS MASSED IN PICTURESQUE CONFUSION AT THE BASE OF A LITTLE HILL
DID HE EXPECT TO BORROW
AND WHAT DOES HIS EXCELLENCY SAY INQUIRED HAKKABUT
BUT IT OUGHT TO BE DONE BY THIS TIME CIRCUMFERENCE 1,400
WHY SHOULD WE DOUBT THAT THE ELEMENTS OF A COMET WHICH HAS ONCE COME INTO COLLISION WITH THE EARTH HAVE BY THIS TIME BEEN ACCURATELY CALCULATED
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE SOIL OF GALLIA YES I CAN ANSWER THAT
TREES AND SHRUBS WERE FEW IN NUMBER AND TO CUT THEM DOWN IN PROSPECT OF THE COLD SEEMED A VERY QUESTIONABLE POLICY
AND STILL NO INTELLIGIBLE SIGNATURE AND NO ADDRESS
AS BRIEFLY AS HE COULD SERVADAC ENDEAVORED TO EXPLAIN THE TRUE CONDITION OF THINGS
SERVADAC CAST A HASTY GLANCE ROUND
THE PROFESSOR GLARED AT HIM FIERCELY
THE VERY THOUGHT OF A FELLOW-COUNTRYMAN IN PERIL OF STARVATION DROVE HIM WELL-NIGH TO DISTRACTION AND IT WAS IN VAIN THAT SEARCH WAS MADE EVERYWHERE NEAR THE SCENE OF CONFLICT IN HOPES OF FINDING THE MISSING SCRAP THAT MIGHT BEAR A SIGNATURE OR ADDRESS
THE EXCAVATION OF ANY SILO BEING THUS MANIFESTLY HOPELESS THERE SEEMED NOTHING TO BE DONE EXCEPT TO TRY AND RENDER THE BUILDINGS ALONGSIDE THE GOURBI IMPERVIOUS TO FROST
SERVADAC TURNED TO HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE WAS STILL DISPOSED TO PUT OUT TO SEA AND MAKE FOR ALGIERS
AFTER MEDITATING A WHILE HE SPOKE AGAIN
DO YOU NOT THINK YOU MAY HAVE MADE SOME ERROR COUNT IN RECKONING THE BEARINGS OF YOUR YACHT NO COLONEL I AM QUITE CERTAIN OF MY RECKONINGS
IF UPON THE OCEAN WOULD ANY PASSING VESSEL BE WITHIN HAIL TO RESCUE THEM FROM THEIR CRITICAL POSITION
NO DIRECT SHOCK HOWEVER COULD BE APPREHENDED
NATURE HAS PROVIDED US WITH OUR WINTER QUARTERS
INTENSELY ANXIOUS AS HE WAS TO REVISIT THE PROVINCE OF ORAN AND EAGER TOO TO SATISFY HIMSELF OF THE WELFARE OF HIS FAITHFUL BEN ZOOF SERVADAC COULD NOT BUT OWN THE REASONABLENESS OF THE LIEUTENANT'S OBJECTIONS AND YIELDED TO THE PROPOSAL THAT THE EASTWARD COURSE SHOULD BE ADOPTED
SERVADAC COULD NOT QUITE CONCEAL HIS AMUSEMENT AT THE COUNT'S IRONY BUT CONTINUED THIS IS LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THE OFFICER IN COMMAND OF THE DOBRYNA THE PROFESSOR BOWED AGAIN IN FRIGID DIGNITY
WHY HAD THEY NOT BEEN SAILING PERSISTENTLY TO THE EAST
DOUBLY RUINED BY THE LOSS OF HIS TARTAN AND BY THE ABANDONMENT OF HIS FORTUNE HE DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY FROM THE SCENE
VERY GOOD SAID THE PROFESSOR
ON THEIR WAY THEIR CONVERSATION NATURALLY WAS ENGROSSED BY THE SUBJECT OF THE DIRE NECESSITIES WHICH ONLY TOO MANIFESTLY WERE AWAITING THEM
NOT ONLY THE DIAMETERS BUT ALSO THE WEIGHTS OF THE FRENCH COINS ARE RIGIDLY DETERMINED BY LAW AND AS THE SILVER FIVE-FRANC PIECES ALWAYS WEIGH EXACTLY TWENTY-FIVE GRAMMES THE UNITED WEIGHT OF FORTY OF THESE COINS IS KNOWN TO AMOUNT TO ONE KILOGRAMME
AFTER THOUGHTFULLY REGARDING THE DOCUMENT FOR SOME TIME
HIS ONLY REMAINING HOPE WAS THAT THE CHAIN OF MARVELS WAS NOT YET COMPLETE AND THAT SOMETHING FARTHER MIGHT THROW SOME LIGHT UPON THE MYSTERY
WHAT WOULD BE THE MEASURE OF THE ECCENTRICITY OF ITS PATH
THE ORIGIN OF THE CATASTROPHE WAS A PROBLEM STILL TO BE SOLVED
WHO TALKS OF GETTING BACK
THE FOURTH WAS ORANGE AT TIMES APPROACHING TO A RED
IT WAS SOON OBSERVED THAT THIS NEWLY DISCOVERED LAND WAS OF VERY IRREGULAR ELEVATION THAT IT EXTENDED DUE EAST AND WEST ACROSS THE HORIZON THUS DIVIDING THE GULF INTO TWO SEPARATE SECTIONS AND COMPLETELY CONCEALING THE ISLAND OF JERBA WHICH MUST LIE BEHIND
I MUST HAVE MORE THAN THAT THE PROFESSOR CONTINUED
COME MULTIPLY THE SURFACE BY THE THIRD OF THE RADIUS
I SAY BEN ZOOF HE CALLED ALOUD TO HIS ORDERLY WHO WAS TROTTING SILENTLY CLOSE IN HIS REAR DID YOU EVER COMPOSE ANY POETRY NO CAPTAIN ANSWERED THE MAN PROMPTLY
BUT BY FREQUENT EXCURSIONS ACROSS THE FROZEN STRAIT AND BY THE CONSTANT USE OF THE TELEGRAPH HAD KEPT UP THEIR COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN ON THE OTHER ISLAND
TO WHOM THAT REPORT SHOULD BE DELIVERED WAS A PROBLEM HE HAD YET TO SOLVE
FISHING HAD TO BE CARRIED ON WHILE THE CONDITION OF THE SEA WOULD ALLOW IT
82,000,000 L
AMONGST OTHER THINGS THAT FAILED HIM WAS HIS STOCK OF COFFEE AND AS COFFEE WAS A BEVERAGE WITHOUT WHICH HE DEEMED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXIST HE FOUND HIMSELF IN CONSIDERABLE PERPLEXITY
BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVADAC BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS HIS GOOD ABILITIES HOWEVER AND HIS READY INTELLIGENCE HAD CARRIED HIM SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH THE CURRICULUM OF HIS EARLY CAREER
NO SOONER HOWEVER DID HE FIND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RETREAT FROM HIS STUDY OF THE HEAVENS THAN HE WOULD BEGIN OVERWHELMING EVERYBODY ABOUT HIM WITH BITTER COMPLAINTS POURING OUT HIS REGRETS THAT HE HAD EVER QUITTED HIS QUARTERS AT FORMENTERA
LIKE THE SUN IT HAD RISEN IN THE WEST AND WAS NOW AT ITS FULL
FOR THE LAST FORTNIGHT SERVADAC HAD NOT BEEN OCCUPYING HIS PROPER LODGINGS IN THE MILITARY QUARTERS
ACCORDINGLY HE SET HIS HEART ON GETTING ALL THE MONETARY WEALTH OF GALLIA INTO HIS POSSESSION AND TO DO THIS HE MUST SELL HIS GOODS
MEANWHILE THE EARTH'S DISC WAS DAILY INCREASING IN MAGNITUDE
HE FELT MORE AND MORE CONVINCED THAT THE WRITER WAS A FRENCHMAN AND THAT THE LAST LINE INDICATED THAT HE WAS IN DISTRESS FROM SCARCITY OF FOOD
BUT THE REVERSED POSITION OF EAST AND WEST THE DIMINUTION OF THE FORCE OF GRAVITY THE ALTERED ROTATION OF THE EARTH AND HER PROJECTION UPON A NEW ORBIT WERE ALL THINGS THAT GAVE THEM LITTLE CONCERN AND NO UNEASINESS
THE EARTH SEEMED AS ELASTIC AS THE SPRINGBOARD OF AN ACROBAT
MY CALCULATIONS WANT NO REVISION
DAY AND NIGHT HE PERSEVERED IN HIS ASTRONOMICAL PURSUITS DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF NEVER ABANDONING HIS COMET AND SWORE POSITIVELY THAT NOTHING SHOULD INDUCE HIM TO SET FOOT IN THE CAR OF THE BALLOON
IT IS PLACED ON RECORD THAT THE ENGLISH HAVE SURVIVED IT OR SOMETHING QUITE APPROXIMATE UPON THEIR ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS
THIS EXERCISE WAS NOT ONLY HEALTHFUL IN ITSELF BUT IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IN CASE OF NECESSITY IT MIGHT BECOME A VERY USEFUL MEANS OF LOCOMOTION
NOW IN ORDER TO CALCULATE THE ELEMENTS OF A COMET IT IS ALWAYS DEEMED THE SAFEST MODE OF PROCEDURE TO ASSUME THE ORBIT TO BE A PARABOLA
THE DAY FOLLOWING SERVADAC'S RETURN HE AND THE COUNT AND LIEUTENANT PROCOPE MET BY AGREEMENT IN THE CAVE FORMALLY TO DISCUSS WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST ADVISABLE METHOD OF PROCEEDING UNDER THEIR PRESENT PROSPECTS
THE ROOF WAS PUT ON AND BENEATH IT WERE STORED THE PROVISIONS THE WRAPS AND THE COOKING UTENSILS
YOU WILL OF COURSE MAKE UP THE DEFICIENCY THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED NOT NOTICING THE INTERRUPTION
IF WE CAN ASCERTAIN THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN THE SHOCK IS TO HAPPEN AND CAN SUCCEED IN LAUNCHING OURSELVES A SUFFICIENT TIME BEFOREHAND INTO GALLIA'S ATMOSPHERE I BELIEVE IT WILL TRANSPIRE THAT THIS ATMOSPHERE WILL AMALGAMATE WITH THAT OF THE EARTH AND THAT A BALLOON WHIRLED ALONG BY THE COMBINED VELOCITY WOULD GLIDE INTO THE MINGLED ATMOSPHERE AND REMAIN SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR UNTIL THE SHOCK OF THE COLLISION IS OVERPAST COUNT TIMASCHEFF REFLECTED FOR A MINUTE AND SAID I THINK LIEUTENANT I UNDERSTAND YOUR PROJECT
THIS DECISION WAS ESPECIALLY WELCOME TO HECTOR SERVADAC WHO THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF THE LAST FIVE WEEKS HAD BEEN AGITATED BY MUCH ANXIOUS THOUGHT ON ACCOUNT OF THE FAITHFUL SERVANT HE HAD LEFT BEHIND
HE SHALL PAY FOR IT YET
IN SHALLOW PLACES LIKE THIS AS THE CRUST OF ICE THICKENS IT FORCES EVERYTHING UPWARDS WITH IRRESISTIBLE FORCE BUT SURELY THIS PROCESS OF CONGELATION MUST HAVE A LIMIT SAID THE COUNT
ON THE EIGHTH EVENING AFTER STARTING THE TRAVELERS AGAIN SET FOOT ON THE VOLCANIC PROMONTORY JUST IN TIME TO WITNESS A GREAT COMMOTION
NOT EVEN SERVADAC COULD DISCOVER A TRACE OF THE SEAS CHASMS CRATERS AND MOUNTAINS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO MINUTELY DELINEATED IN LUNAR CHARTS AND IT COULD NOT BE DENIED THAT ANY TRANSIENT HOPE THAT HAD BEEN EXCITED AS TO THEIR ONCE AGAIN BEING ABOUT TO ENJOY THE PEACEFUL SMILES OF THE QUEEN OF NIGHT MUST ALL BE RESIGNED
THE EASTERN HEMISPHERE LIES BEFORE THEM IN THE FULL BLAZE OF LIGHT AND THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF ERROR IN DISTINGUISHING CONTINENT FROM CONTINENT
A PLEASANT TEMPERATURE ENABLED HIM TO LIVE ENTIRELY IN HIS OBSERVATORY FROM WHICH INTRUDERS WERE RIGIDLY SHUT OUT
THE PROFESSOR COMPLETELY NONPLUSSED WAS LEFT ALONE
BY THE 10TH THE REMOVAL WAS ACCOMPLISHED
MIGHT IT NOT LIKE A COMET BE CARRIED AWAY INTO THE VAST INFINITY OF SPACE
IT SEEMS TO ME PROBABLE THAT THEY ARE BEING SENT BROADCAST UPON THE SEA I WONDER WHERE THE HARE-BRAINED SAVANT THAT WRITES THEM CAN BE LIVING OBSERVED SERVADAC
I WANT TEN TWO-FRANC PIECES AND TWENTY HALF-FRANCS LET ME SEE SAID SERVADAC HOW MUCH IS THAT IN ALL
THE UNVARYING CALMNESS OF THE CLIMATE NOTWITHSTANDING THE COLD HAD TENDED TO MAINTAIN THEM IN GOOD HEALTH AND THERE SEEMED NO REASON TO DOUBT THAT WHEN GALLIA RETURNED TO THE EARTH THE TOTAL OF ITS LITTLE POPULATION WOULD STILL BE COMPLETE
OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND YOU KNOW TRUE REPLIED SERVADAC
IT MAY BE AT THE EXACTLY OPPOSITE POINT AT OUR ANTIPODES
WHAT A MISFORTUNE IT IS HE ADDED SPEAKING TO HIMSELF TO HAVE A PEACOCK'S VOICE WITHOUT ITS PLUMAGE DURING THE MONTHS OF JULY AND AUGUST GALLIA ADVANCED 164,000,000 LEAGUES ALONG HER ORBIT
SERVADAC HIMSELF UNDERTOOK THE TUITION OF PABLO AND NINA BEN ZOOF BEING THEIR COMPANION IN PLAY-HOURS WHEN HE ENTERTAINED THEM WITH ENCHANTING STORIES IN THE BEST PARISIAN FRENCH ABOUT A LOVELY CITY AT THE FOOT OF A MOUNTAIN WHERE HE ALWAYS PROMISED ONE DAY TO TAKE THEM
I REQUIRE GENTLEMEN RESUMED ROSETTE FIRST OF ALL TO KNOW BY HOW MUCH THE WEIGHT OF A KILOGRAMME HERE DIFFERS FROM ITS WEIGHT UPON THE EARTH
IN THE CREEK WHERE THE TWO VESSELS HAD BEEN MOORED FOR THE WINTER THE ELEVATION OF THE ICE IN ANTICIPATION OF WHICH LIEUTENANT PROCOPE HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE OF BEVELING WAS GOING ON SLOWLY BUT IRRESISTIBLY AND THE TARTAN WAS UPHEAVED FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE GALLIAN SEA WHILE THE SCHOONER AS BEING LIGHTER HAD BEEN RAISED TO A STILL GREATER ALTITUDE
IF THE SIDE OF THE COMET ON WHICH WE ARE RESIDENT IMPINGES ON THE EARTH IT STANDS TO REASON THAT WE MUST BE CRUSHED TO ATOMS BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE CONCUSSION REGULAR MINCEMEAT SAID BEN ZOOF WHOM NO ADMONITIONS COULD QUITE REDUCE TO SILENCE
THE FIRE WAS LIGHTED JUST AS USUAL AND FANNED INTO VIGOR BY BEN ZOOF APPLYING HIS MOUTH IN LIEU OF BELLOWS AND A BRIGHT FLAME STARTED UP FROM THE MIDST OF THE TWIGS AND COAL
BEN ZOOF IN PARTICULAR WAS NEVER WEARIED OF TELLING HIM HOW ON HIS RETURN TO THE WORLD HE WOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR USING FALSE WEIGHTS AND WOULD CERTAINLY BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE INSIDE OF A PRISON
ALLOW ME TO PRESENT TO YOU MY EXCELLENT FRIEND THE COUNT TIMASCHEFF HE SAID
IN TIME THE GLOW OF THE BURNING LAVA REFLECTED IN THE ICY MIRROR FELL UPON THE TROOP OF SKATERS AND CAST THEIR LENGTHENED SHADOWS GROTESQUELY ON THE SURFACE OF THE FROZEN SEA
ALREADY TO THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE LITTLE ITALIAN GIRL NURTURED IN SUNSHINE ICE WAS BEGINNING TO FORM IN THE CREVICES OF THE ROCKS AND MANIFESTLY THE TIME WAS IMPENDING WHEN THE SEA ITSELF WOULD FREEZE
A LOT OF LIES CONFOUND THE KNAVE EXCLAIMED BEN ZOOF
AND THAT HIS ROTATION ON HIS AXIS OCCUPIES ONLY 9 HOURS AND 55 MINUTES
ENGLAND
AGAIN AND AGAIN HE ASKED HIMSELF WHAT THE CATASTROPHE COULD PORTEND
THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM THAT DID NOT REALIZE MORE OR LESS HOW CRITICAL WAS THEIR POSITION
EVERY PRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENT WAS HURRIED ON WITH THE GREATEST EARNESTNESS
ARE THEY TO BE ALLOWED SILENCE MORDECAI YOU FOOL SHOUTED BEN ZOOF WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO CALL THE JEW BY ANY HEBREW NAME THAT CAME UPPERMOST TO HIS MEMORY
OF GOLD SERVADAC UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE
SO I AM ON STATE OCCASIONS
NEITHER CAPE NEGRO NOR CAPE SERRAT WAS TO BE SEEN
YOU SHALL SEE WHAT A NICE LITTLE FAIRY NINA IS
BUT HE ENTERED INTO NO EXPLANATION
OF COURSE THEY ORIGINATED WITH ME
THE SPORTSMEN DID THEIR BEST
THE PROFESSOR HEAVED A LONG SIGH OF RELIEF AND ONCE MORE CLOSED HIS EYES
ON THE 31ST THEN BEN ZOOF WAS INVESTED WITH GOVERNOR'S POWERS AND TOOK AN AFFECTING LEAVE OF HIS MASTER BEGGING HIM IF CHANCE SHOULD CARRY HIM NEAR MONTMARTRE TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE BELOVED MOUNTAIN HAD BEEN LEFT UNMOVED
HIS WATCHING WAS IN VAIN
THE SUN WAS APPROACHING THE ZENITH BUT SO DIM AND ENFEEBLED WERE HIS RAYS THAT THEY WERE VERY UNLIKE WHAT HAD PRODUCED THE WINES OF BORDEAUX AND BURGUNDY WHICH THEY HAD JUST BEEN ENJOYING AND IT WAS NECESSARY FOR ALL BEFORE STARTING UPON AN EXCURSION THAT WOULD LAST OVER NIGHTFALL TO ENVELOP THEMSELVES IN THE THICKEST OF CLOTHING
AND AFTER BEN ZOOF ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HAD RETURNED THE STEELYARD AND THE BORROWED CASH RECEIVING BACK THE PAPER ROUBLES DEPOSITED ALL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE JEW AND NINA'S HIVE HAD CEASED
BEN ZOOF AND THE RUSSIANS JEERED HIM MOST UNMERCIFULLY
COUNT TIMASCHEFF'S DESIRE TO RETURN TO THE WORLD WAS QUITE EQUALED BY LIEUTENANT PROCOPE'S
AWHILE THEY GAZED AT THE SEA AND AT EACH OTHER IN MUTE AMAZEMENT
BUT GALLIA HAD A NARROW DESTINY
YOU ARE VERY WELCOME SAID ROSETTE BOWING TO THE COUNT WITH A SMILE OF CONDESCENSION
THE DISTRICT WAS QUITE DESERTED AND THEY HAD NO REASON TO FEAR ANY LEGAL PENALTY
DEVILS WHY BEN ZOOF WHAT'S THE MATTER SAID SERVADAC SOOTHINGLY
STUDIOUS IF POSSIBLE TO CONCEAL HIS REAL MISGIVINGS AND ANXIOUS THAT THE REST OF THE PARTY SHOULD BE AFFECTED AS LITTLE AS MIGHT BE BY HIS OWN UNEASINESS SERVADAC WOULD WANDER ALONE ABOUT THE ISLAND RACKING HIS BRAIN FOR AN IDEA THAT WOULD POINT THE WAY OUT OF THE SERIOUS DIFFICULTY
GAINED THE MOUTH OF THE GALLERY
ILLUSTRATION OMITTED PAGE INTENTIONALLY BLANK AND BY THE PROFESSOR'S TABLES GALLIA DURING THE MONTH WOULD HAVE ADVANCED 27,500,000 LEAGUES FARTHER ALONG ITS ORBIT AND WOULD HAVE ATTAINED A DISTANCE OF 155,000,000 LEAGUES FROM THE SUN
BUT SERVADAC EXPRESSING HIMSELF AS MOST GRATEFUL FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION DECLINED THEIR OFFER AND AVOWED HIS RESOLUTION OF TAKING NO OTHER COMPANION THAN HIS OWN ORDERLY
YOU HAVE FOUND NO TRACE OF ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE
FALSEHOOD ROARED ROSETTE
HERE THEY WERE COMPELLED TO STOP FOR NOT ONLY HAD THE BRIDGE COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED BUT THE RIVER ITSELF NO LONGER EXISTED
NOR WAS THIS SUPPOSITION SUGGESTED MERELY BY THE LOWERING OF THE TEMPERATURE
WHY TO GET OFF THE COMET BEFORE THE SHOCK COMES HOW COULD YOU GET OFF GALLIA THAT I CAN'T SAY REPLIED THE ORDERLY
BUT HERE AT LEAST IN NINA'S HIVE WERE MANY RIVALS FOR EVERYONE COULD SO FAR DISTINGUISH THEM ONE FROM THE OTHER AS TO DESCRIBE THEM BY THEIR COLORS
HIS NAME WAS ISAAC HAKKABUT AND HE WAS A NATIVE OF COLOGNE
THESE TWO ELEMENTS BEING OBTAINED THE POSITION IN SPACE OF THE COMET'S ORBIT WAS DETERMINED
THEY WERE WRONG
FROM THE REALISTIC SIDE THE WORK IS PAINSTAKING AND EXACT AS ALL THE AUTHOR'S WORKS
THEY KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT ENGLISHMEN WHATEVER THEIR FAULTS WOULD BE THE LAST TO ABANDON THEIR FELLOW-CREATURES IN THE HOUR OF DISTRESS
THE MASS WAS WRONG
THERE WAS THE INTENSEST INTEREST AWAKENED TO DETERMINE WHETHER NO VESTIGE COULD BE TRACED OF MAJORCA MINORCA OR ANY OF THE GROUP AND IT WAS DURING A DEVIATION FROM THE DIRECT COURSE FOR THE PURPOSE OF A MORE THOROUGH SCRUTINY THAT ONE OF THE SAILORS RAISED A THRILL OF GENERAL EXCITEMENT BY SHOUTING A BOTTLE IN THE SEA HERE THEN AT LENGTH WAS A COMMUNICATION FROM THE OUTER WORLD
NOR WERE THERE ANY IGNEOUS STONES OR RED-HOT CINDERS MINGLED WITH THE SMOKE THAT CROWNED THE SUMMIT
THE ONLY MALCONTENT WAS PALMYRIN ROSETTE
BUT WAIT A BIT
HAVING BEEN DULY CHARGED WITH POWDER AND BALL THE GUN WAS RAISED TO AN ANGLE OF SOMETHING UNDER 45 DEGREES SO AS TO ALLOW PROPER DEVELOPMENT TO THE CURVE THAT THE PROJECTILE WOULD MAKE AND AT A SIGNAL FROM THE MAJOR THE LIGHT WAS APPLIED TO THE PRIMING
MORE THAN ONCE THE CURTAIN ITSELF WAS RIFTED ENTIRELY ASUNDER BUT ONLY TO CLOSE UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY AFTER ALLOWING A MOMENTARY DRAUGHT OF COLD AIR TO PENETRATE THE HALL IN A WAY THAT WAS REFRESHING AND RATHER ADVANTAGEOUS THAN OTHERWISE
THE EARTH AND A COMET ARE BROUGHT TWICE INTO COLLISION WITHOUT MANKIND IN GENERAL OR EVEN OUR ASTRONOMERS BECOMING CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT
GOOD MASTER ISAAC
IT WAS QUITE DARK
HIS YACHT HAS CONVEYED US RIGHT ROUND GALLIA ADDED THE CAPTAIN
IT WOULD NOT BE PROFESSOR ROSETTE'S LOT TO ENLIGHTEN HIS BROTHER SAVANTS TO ANY GREAT DEGREE AS TO THE MYSTERIES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS WHICH MUST EVER RANK AS ONE OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT AMONGST THE HEAVENLY ORBS
AND IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME YOU MAY GO TO THE DEVIL WITHOUT AVAILING HIMSELF OF THIS POLITE INVITATION BEN ZOOF BETOOK HIMSELF TO HIS MASTER
IT WAS ABOUT AS UNLUCKY A SPEECH AS HE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE MADE
SALT AS BRINE HE EXCLAIMED AS SOON AS HE HAD TASTED IT
THE PRECOCITY OF VEGETATION CAUSED SOME EMBARRASSMENT
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT DEMANDED THE PROFESSOR TURNING ROUND UPON HIM ANGRILY
AND CERTAIN LUMINOUS POINTS PROJECTING FROM THE CRESCENT AS PLAINLY MARKED THE EXISTENCE OF MOUNTAINS
IF THAT BE SO OBSERVED THE COUNT IT ACCOUNTS FOR SOME OF THE STRANGE PHENOMENA WE WITNESS
THE ONLY QUESTION REMAINING WAS AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF GOING ON FOOT
THE REST OF THE POPULATION OF THE HIVE WERE ALL PRESENTED IN SUCCESSION
THE THIEVES SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED BEN ZOOF STAMPING HIS FOOT WITH RAGE
THE MOTIONS OF THE CELESTIAL SPHERES WERE ERRONEOUS AS THOSE OF A WATCH WITH A DEFECTIVE MAINSPRING AND THERE WAS REASON TO FEAR THAT THE SUN WOULD NEVER AGAIN SHED HIS RADIANCE UPON THE EARTH
THE PHYSIOLOGY OF BELTS AND SPOTS ALIKE WAS BEYOND THE ASTRONOMER'S POWER TO ASCERTAIN
AFTER A LONG AND SOMEWHAT WAVERING DISCUSSION IT WAS AT LENGTH DECIDED THAT THE SCHOONER SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FAVORABLE WIND AND WEATHER AND PROCEED AT FIRST TOWARDS THE EAST THUS FOLLOWING THE OUTLINE OF WHAT HAD FORMERLY REPRESENTED THE COAST OF AFRICA UNTIL THAT COAST HAD BEEN LOST IN BOUNDLESS SEA
INCREDIBLE REPEATED SERVADAC
NOR WAS THEIR RECREATION ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR STUDIES
THE CAPTAIN AND HIS FRIENDS FOLLOWED AT SOME DISTANCE BY THE EAGER JEW SOON LEFT THE GLADE AND DIRECTED THEIR STEPS TOWARDS THE COAST WHERE THE HANSA WAS MOORED
IT IS UNDESIRABLE IN EVERY WAY FOR ANY NAMES TO BE MENTIONED IN THAT CASE HOWEVER CONTINUED THE COUNT IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ASSIGN AN OSTENSIBLE PRETEXT OF SOME KIND
SOMETHING MUST BE DONE I THINK SAID LIEUTENANT PROCOPE BREAKING HIS THOUGHTFUL SILENCE THAT I CAN TELL YOU OF A SLEDGE ALREADY PROVIDED FOR YOUR HAND AND I CAN SUGGEST A MOTIVE POWER SURER AND SWIFTER THAN HORSES WHAT DO YOU MEAN WAS THE EAGER INQUIRY
THE VELOCITY BECAME INCONCEIVABLY GREAT BUT THE INCREASED RATE OF MOTION WAS IN NO WAY PERCEPTIBLE
PSHAW CRIED SERVADAC WITH A CONTEMPTUOUS SNEER
AND IN SEVERAL PLACES THE GALLERIES HAD TO BE FURTHER EXCAVATED TO RENDER THEM MORE AVAILABLE FOR USE
BEN ZOOF IN HIS TURN DANCED A PAS SEUL OFTEN PERFORMED IN THE ELYSEE MONTMARTRE WITH AN ELEGANCE AND VIGOR THAT EARNED MANY COMPLIMENTS FROM NEGRETE
ALL THESE WERE DOUBTLESS BUT THE PRELUDE TO ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES OF A MORE STARTLING CHARACTER
AN ISLAND TOMB NO LONGER THEN COULD THERE BE ANY DOUBT AS TO THE ANNIHILATION OF A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE COLONY
IT IS SCARCELY TWO O'CLOCK TWO IN THE MORNING OR TWO IN THE AFTERNOON ASKED BEN ZOOF AGAIN REGARDING THE SUN
59,000,000 1
ISAAC HAKKABUT AND THE PROFESSOR WERE THE ONLY TWO MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO TOOK NO PART IN THIS SOMEWHAT TEDIOUS PROCEEDING
SCARCELY 31,000,000 MILES HAD SEPARATED GALLIA FROM JUPITER
IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT HE WOULD HAVE DECLARED HIMSELF READY TO PUT UP WITH ANY AMOUNT OF DISCOMFORT TO BE ABLE TO GRATIFY HIS LOVE OF INVESTIGATION
TWO DAYS MORE AND THE EARTH SHIVERED INTO A MYRIAD ATOMS WOULD BE LOST IN BOUNDLESS SPACE
IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT WE SHALL BE FORGOTTEN
THE FIERY CATARACT NO LONGER SPREAD ITS GLOWING COVERING OVER THE MOUTH OF THE GROTTO
I AM NOT GOING TO LET YOUR CURSED OBSTINACY INCUR THE RISK OF LOSING YOUR CARGO ALTOGETHER MERCIFUL HEAVEN
THE ORBITS OF VENUS AND MERCURY ARE WITHIN THE ORBIT OF THE EARTH VENUS ROTATING AT AN AVERAGE DISTANCE OF 66,130,000 MILES FROM THE SUN AND MERCURY AT THAT OF 35,393,000
THE POPULATION WAS PERFECTLY CALM
NOTHING ONCE ACCOMPLISHED CAN EVER BE EFFACED WHO CAN ALTOGETHER BE ASTONISHED THAT PALMYRIN ROSETTE WITH HIS BURNING THIRST FOR ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF A LONGING FOR YET WIDER TRAVEL THROUGH THE SIDEREAL UNIVERSE
IF THIS WERE ACTUALLY THE MOON HER DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH MUST HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY SOME MILLIONS OF MILES
I HAVE TAKEN PAINS HE CONTINUED TO SATISFY MYSELF THAT THESE COINS ARE IN PROPER CONDITION FOR MY PURPOSE
BUT ALL ALONG THERE WAS THE SAME ABSENCE OF BEACH OR TRACT OF SAND TO MARK ITS BASE NEITHER WERE THERE ANY OF THOSE SHOALS OF ROCK THAT ARE ORDINARILY FOUND IN SHALLOW WATER
HERE QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY THE EXPLORERS MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT THE MASSIVE WALL OF CLIFF HAD BEEN RENT FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM BY A NARROW RIFT LIKE THE DRY BED OF A MOUNTAIN TORRENT AND AT THE BASE OF THE OPENING LEVEL WITH THE SEA WAS A LITTLE STRAND UPON WHICH THERE WAS JUST SPACE ENOUGH FOR THEIR BOAT TO BE HAULED UP
HE FLUNG DOWN NOTES TO THE VALUE OF SEVERAL RUBLES
BUT HECTOR SERVADAC RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD ADOPT A DEVICE TO SECURE THAT AT LEAST SOME RECORD OF THEIR EXCURSION IN SOLAR DISTANCES SHOULD SURVIVE THEMSELVES
AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH THE SHORE WAS AS IT HAD EVER BEEN A SUCCESSION OF CLIFFS BEACH AND ARID ROCKS TINGED WITH A RED FERRUGINOUS HUE
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO WEIGH IT WITH
CEDED TO ENGLAND BY THE TREATY OF UTRECHT
HIS OCCUPATION WAS FAR TOO ABSORBING FOR HIM TO SUFFER IT TO BE INTERRUPTED AND TO HIM LIVING AS HE DID PERPETUALLY IN A WORLD OF FIGURES THE WINTER DAYS SEEMED NEITHER LONG NOR WEARISOME
TO THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY LONDON AND KEPT IN READINESS FOR TRANSMISSION BY THE FIRST SHIP THAT SHOULD HAIL IN SIGHT
THE VOLCANO ROCKED AND TREMBLED WITH THE CONVULSIONS OF INTERNAL DISTURBANCE AND SERVADAC AND HIS COMPANIONS CONVINCED THAT THE MOUNTAIN WAS DOOMED TO SOME SUDDEN DISRUPTION RUSHED INTO THE OPEN AIR
IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
THE NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO OBTAIN THE PRECISE WEIGHT OF A KILOGRAMME
BUT HERE THE CALM FLOW OF THE LIQUID FIRE APPEARED TO BE SUPPLIED FROM A SOURCE THAT WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE IN THE SAME WAY AS THE WATERS OF NIAGARA GLIDING ON STEADILY TO THEIR FINAL PLUNGE WOULD DEFY ALL EFFORT TO ARREST THEIR COURSE
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS VERY NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE TENDENCY TO DESPOND BY CONTINUAL DIVERSION
TWO SAILS A BRIGANTINE AND A JIB WERE ARRANGED TO CATCH THE WIND TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE AND THE TRAVELERS ESTIMATED THAT THEIR PROGRESS WOULD BE LITTLE UNDER THE RATE OF TWELVE LEAGUES AN HOUR
STRICTLY SPEAKING THIS ISLAND WAS QUADRILATERAL BUT THE SIDES WERE SO IRREGULAR THAT IT WAS MUCH MORE NEARLY A TRIANGLE THE COMPARISON OF THE SIDES EXHIBITING THESE PROPORTIONS
IF WE FAIL IN OUR OBJECT AND CANNOT GET TO THE DEPTHS OF THE MOUNTAIN OUR LITTLE COLONY IS DOOMED SAID COUNT TIMASCHEFF
ROSETTE SCANNED HIS COUNTENANCE NARROWLY AND WAS ABOUT TO PROBE HIM WITH FURTHER QUESTIONS WHEN BEN ZOOF RETURNED
WE MUST INQUIRE MORE ABOUT THIS HE SAID
INCREDIBLE ECHOED THE MAJOR
IT EVIDENTLY FORMED THE UNIVERSAL SUBSTRUCTURE OF THE NEW ASTEROID
BUT ON THE NORTH SIDE THE SNOW HAD GIVEN PLACE TO THE CASCADE OF FIERY LAVA WHICH MAKING ITS WAY DOWN THE SLOPING ROCKS AS FAR AS THE VAULTED OPENING OF THE CENTRAL CAVERN FELL THENCE PERPENDICULARLY INTO THE SEA
VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE CORPORAL
SURELY SOME PORTION OF THE CASBAH MUST STILL RISE ABOVE THE WAVES
ALL LOOKED BLACK AND DESOLATE
I SEE MONTMARTRE AND SMILE AT THE ABSURDITY AS OTHERS MIGHT NOTHING COULD INDUCE THE WORTHY ORDERLY TO SURRENDER HIS BELIEF THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY MAKE OUT THE FEATURES OF HIS BELOVED HOME
THEN MARVELOUS TO RELATE INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE ORDINARY LAWS OF CELESTIAL MECHANISM AND DESCENDING UPON THE OPPOSITE HORIZON IT SEEMED TO RETREAT FARTHER OFF GREW DIMMER AND VANISHED
ARE YOU JOSEPH HE ASKED
36 DEGREES AND BY REFERENCE TO THE CHARTS IT WAS TOLERABLY CERTAIN THAT SHE WAS CRUISING OVER THE SITE OF THE SAHEL THE RIDGE THAT HAD SEPARATED THE RICH PLAIN OF THE MITIDJA FROM THE SEA AND OF WHICH THE HIGHEST PEAK MOUNT BOUJEREAH HAD REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF 1,200 FEET
AT LENGTH IT WOULD ADMIT A MAN'S BODY AND BEN ZOOF CARRYING A TORCH PUSHED HIMSELF THROUGH IT FOLLOWED BY THE LIEUTENANT AND SERVADAC
WE WANT TO KNOW WHETHER AS THE DAYS ARE ONLY SIX HOURS LONG WE ARE TO HAVE BUT TWO MEALS INSTEAD OF FOUR THE OFFICERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND BY THEIR GLANCES AGREED THAT THE CORPORAL WAS A MAN OF SOUND COMMON SENSE
HAKKABUT DREW OUT A SMALL PIECE OF GOLD FROM HIS POCKET TOOK IT CLOSE UNDER THE LAMP ROLLED IT OVER IN HIS HAND AND PRESSED IT TO HIS LIPS
BOTH OF THEM MOREOVER WERE RIGID DISCIPLES OF THE RENOWNED PHILIDOR WHO PRONOUNCES THAT TO PLAY THE PAWNS WELL IS THE SOUL OF CHESS
THE INCLINATION OF THE PLANE OF THE COMETARY ORBIT TO THE PLANE OF THE ECLIPTIC AN ANGLE WHICH IS GENERALLY CONSIDERABLE BUT IN THIS CASE THE PLANES WERE PROVED TO COINCIDE
NO FEAR REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
NOT ONLY WOULD SHE BE IN DANGER IN THE EVENT OF A STORM BUT IT IS VERY QUESTIONABLE WHETHER SHE COULD RESIST THE PRESSURE OF THE ICE IF THE WATER WERE TO FREEZE QUITE TRUE PROCOPE
AND HOW SHE HAD ASCERTAINED FOR CERTAIN THAT THE SAHARA SEA HAD NO LONGER AN EXISTENCE
FACTS TO BE OBSERVED IN PERFECT CONFORMITY WITH THE KNOWN LAWS OF CELESTIAL MECHANISM
BEN ZOOF AND THE RUSSIAN COOK HAD QUITE SURPASSED THEMSELVES
I SHALL BE KILLED PABLO IN A MOMENT RECOGNIZED THE VOICE AS NINA'S
YOU DID NOT SUPPOSE THAT SHE WAS GOING TO WAIT FOR YOU
CURIOSITY WAS ALL ALIVE
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS DEMANDED THE CAPTAIN
MY INFERENCE REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT IS A CONFIRMATION OF MY SURMISE THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING AN ORBIT DECIDEDLY ELLIPTICAL ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET THE MATERIAL TO DETERMINE ITS ECCENTRICITY AS THE WRITER ADHERES TO THE APPELLATION OF GALLIA DO YOU NOT THINK ASKED THE COUNT THAT WE MIGHT CALL THESE NEW WATERS THE GALLIAN SEA THERE CAN BE NO REASON TO THE CONTRARY COUNT REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT
THEIR MUTUAL RESERVE BECAME MORE APPARENT
AS THE RESULT OF SERVADAC'S COMPUTATIONS HE FORMED THE OPINION THAT VENUS COULD HARDLY BE AT A GREATER DISTANCE THAN 6,000,000 MILES FROM THE EARTH
IT CONTAINED ROOM ENOUGH FOR A BED A TABLE AN ARM-CHAIR A CHEST OF DRAWERS AND WHAT WAS OF STILL MORE CONSEQUENCE FOR THE INDISPENSABLE TELESCOPE
AND HAD SERVADAC BEEN IN POSSESSION OF A BAROMETER HE WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY DISCOVERED THE FACT THAT ONLY NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME AS THE RESULT OF EXPERIMENT REVEALED ITSELF TO HIM--A FACT MOREOVER WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR THE COMPRESSION OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS WHICH BOTH HE AND BEN ZOOF HAD EXPERIENCED AS WELL AS FOR THE ATTENUATION OF THEIR VOICES AND THEIR ACCELERATED BREATHING
IT WAS ONLY NATURAL THAT THIS SHOULD AWAKEN SOME INTEREST EVEN IN THE MOST IMPERTURBABLE MINDS AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THE TWO OFFICERS DURING ONE OF THE RARE INTERVALS WHEN THEY WERE NOT ABSORBED IN THEIR GAME HAD DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE AT LEAST TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE ISLAND WAS DESERTED OR WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT BE OCCUPIED BY SOME OTHERS LIKE THEMSELVES SURVIVORS FROM THE GENERAL CATASTROPHE
FOUR MEALS A DAY HURRAH SHOUTED THE SOLDIERS UNABLE THIS TIME TO KEEP THEIR DELIGHT WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF MILITARY DECORUM
SO BRIEF A VOYAGE WOULD BRING THE DOBRYNA ONCE AGAIN TO HER STARTING-POINT OR IN OTHER WORDS WOULD ENABLE HER TO COMPLETE THE CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE GLOBE
HE SEEMED TO LIVE AMONG THE STARS AND AS LONG AS HE WAS WELL PROVIDED WITH COFFEE HE CARED LITTLE FOR LUXURIES AND PAID LITTLE OR NO REGARD TO THE INGENUITY WITH WHICH ALL THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS OF NINA'S HIVE HAD BEEN DEVISED
THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE UP A WONDERFUL TALE THE COUNT TURNED HIS BACK IN DISGUST WHILE THE JEW SIDLED UP TO LITTLE NINA AND MUTTERED IN ITALIAN
EITHER THEY MUST THEMSELVES HAVE BECOME RATHER DEAF OR IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE AIR HAD BECOME LESS CAPABLE OF TRANSMITTING SOUND
O'CLOCK 18 4 SINGE SINGLE 85 6 PARFAIT
SERVADAC CONSIDERATELY ALLOWED THE WHOLE OF THE CARGO TO BE DEPOSITED IN A HOLLOW APART BY ITSELF OVER WHICH THE JEW WAS PERMITTED TO KEEP A WATCH AS VIGILANT AS HE PLEASED
AND HE CONGRATULATED HIM UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THINGS HAVING BECOME SO LIGHT BECAUSE IT WOULD PREVENT HIM FEELING THE BURDEN OF HIS YEARS
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND
AN INCONSIDERABLE SPECK TO THE NORTH MARKED THE SITE OF GOURBI ISLAND
I AM QUITE FIRM BE IT SO THEN REPLIED ONE OF THE OFFICERS
WITHOUT A CRACK OR FLAW IT EXTENDED FAR BEYOND THE RANGE OF VISION
INDEED THEY ARE ALMOST NEW
THE JEW GAVE A BROAD GRIN WHICH HOWEVER HE WAS CAREFUL TO CONCEAL FROM THE SPANIARDS
TO-DAY WE WANT COFFEE AND WE WANT SUGAR AND WE WANT TOBACCO
AND TURNING TO THE RIGHT-ABOUT THEY MARCHED AWAY LEAVING THE OFFICERS TO RENEW THE ALL-ABSORBING GAME
THE MOUNTAIN ITSELF WAS AN ENORMOUS BLOCK RISING SYMMETRICALLY TO A HEIGHT OF NEARLY 3,000 FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA IN THE FORM OF A TRUNCATED CONE OF WHICH THE TOPMOST SECTION WAS CROWNED BY A WREATH OF SMOKE ISSUING CONTINUOUSLY FROM THE MOUTH OF A NARROW CRATER
HECTOR SERVADAC WAS SILENT
YOU MUST MEAN THE SPANISH SURELY HOW DEMANDED TIMASCHEFF
OF COURSE IT TOOK SEVEN POUNDS OF COFFEE TO DO THIS
THE WORDS WERE FEW BUT THEY WERE ENOUGH TO RECALL THE IDENTITY WHICH SERVADAC WAS TRYING TO MAKE OUT
VIVRES VONT MANQUER ET THE REST OF THE DOCUMENT HAD BEEN SO DAMAGED BY THE BEAKS OF THE GULLS THAT IT WAS ILLEGIBLE
VERY LIKELY HE MAY HAVE MET WITH THE FATE OF AESOP'S ABSTRACTED ASTRONOMER WHO FOUND HIMSELF AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL AY
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SUNSET THE TORCHES WERE LIGHTED AND THE LONG SERIES OF FLAMES FANNED BY THE RAPID MOTION OF THEIR BEARERS HAD MUCH THE APPEARANCE OF AN ENORMOUS FIERY BANNER
TO AN OBSERVER AT THE EQUATOR THIS RING WHICH HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL AS SCARCELY 100 MILES IN THICKNESS MUST HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF A NARROW BAND OF LIGHT PASSING THROUGH THE ZENITH 12,000 MILES ABOVE HIS HEAD
THE SKILLET WAS DULY SET UPON THE STOVE AND BEN ZOOF WAS PREPARED TO WAIT AWHILE FOR THE WATER TO BOIL
THE SCHOONER KEPT BRAVELY ON HER WAY BUT WELL OUT TO SEA AT A DISTANCE OF TWO MILES FROM LAND
ENGLISH-LIKE THE TWO OFFICERS HAD MADE THEMSELVES THOROUGHLY AT HOME IN THE STATION ABROAD IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN THEIR LOT TO BE QUARTERED
UPON REACHING THE SUMMIT THEY FOUND THEIR PROGRESS ARRESTED BY A KIND OF WALL OR RAMPART OF SINGULAR CONSTRUCTION ITS MATERIALS CONSISTING MAINLY OF VASES FRAGMENTS OF COLUMNS CARVED BAS-RELIEFS STATUES AND PORTIONS OF BROKEN STELAE ALL PILED PROMISCUOUSLY TOGETHER WITHOUT ANY PRETENSE TO ARTISTIC ARRANGEMENT
A CONTENTION IN WHICH I FEEL BOUND TO DEFEND WAGNER WHILE YOU ARE THE ZEALOUS CHAMPION OF ROSSINI I AM QUITE CONTENT ANSWERED SERVADAC WITH A SMILE
AT THAT DATE MOSTAGANEM CONTAINED ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND INHABITANTS THREE THOUSAND OF WHOM WERE FRENCH
FORTHWITH THE LEAD WAS GREASED AND LOWERED
WHENEVER YOU PLEASE WAS THE COOL REPLY
WHEN THE JEW HAD RETIRED COUNT TIMASCHEFF ASKED BUT HOW IN THE WORLD CAN YOU EVER MAKE THOSE FELLOWS PAY ANYTHING THEY HAVE LOTS OF MONEY SAID BEN ZOOF
BOTH THE SCHOONER AND THE TARTAN HAD BEEN CAREFULLY MOORED IN THE WAY THAT SEEMED TO PROMISE BEST FOR WITHSTANDING THE RIGOR OF THE WINTER
HARK SAID BEN ZOOF
IT OCCURRED TO HIM HOWEVER THAT THE COUNT ON DISCOVERING AN ISLAND WHERE HE HAD EXPECTED TO FIND THE MAINLAND OF AFRICA WOULD NOT UNLIKELY BE AT A LOSS FOR A PLACE OF ANCHORAGE
AN ENGLISHMAN RARELY SUFFERS FROM ENNUI AND THEN ONLY IN HIS OWN COUNTRY WHEN REQUIRED TO CONFORM TO WHAT HE CALLS THE HUMBUG OF SOCIETY
THIS IS LOGIC WITH A VENGEANCE THE OLD PROFESSOR HAD AN UNDEFINED CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HIS FORMER PUPIL WAS LAUGHING AT HIM
HIS WHOLE NATURE EXULTED IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS ENJOYING A SERVICE THAT HAD BEEN RENDERED GRATUITOUSLY
IT WAS TRAVELING NOW AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AS THE EARTH WHICH TRAVERSES THE ECLIPTIC AT A RATE OF 21,000,000 LEAGUES A MONTH OR 28,800 LEAGUES AN HOUR
AND THE MOST EXPERIENCED METEOROLOGIST WOULD HAVE BEEN PUZZLED TO EXPLAIN THE CAUSE OF THIS STRIKING ILLUMINATION ON THIS 31ST OF DECEMBER THE LAST EVENING OF THE PASSING YEAR
BENEATH THEIR FEET WAS EXTENDED THE BASIN OF THE GALLIAN SEA
THEIR FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THEY WERE CRIES OF DISTRESS AND THEY WERE GREATLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT THEY WERE SHOUTS OF DELIGHT WHICH THE DRYNESS AND PURITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE CAUSED TO RE-ECHO LIKE A VOLLEY OF MUSKETRY
WITH DOGGED OBSTINACY ISAAC HAKKABUT REFUSED TO TAKE ANY SHARE EITHER IN THE LABORS OR THE AMUSEMENTS OF THE COLONY
ALL AT ONCE IT OCCURRED TO THE PROFESSOR THAT THE STEELYARD WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY USELESS TO HIM UNLESS HE HAD THE MEANS FOR ASCERTAINING THE PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF THE UNIT OF THE SOIL OF GALLIA WHICH HE PROPOSED TO WEIGH
THE RUSSIAN SAILORS THE SPANIARDS YOUNG PABLO AND LITTLE NINA ON WHOM THE PROFESSOR EVIDENTLY NO LOVER OF CHILDREN GLARED FIERCELY THROUGH HIS FORMIDABLE SPECTACLES
WHAT IS THAT HE SAID WITH A KIND OF HESITATION
THAT THE CARDINAL POINTS ARE AT VARIANCE WITH ORDINARY RULES AND THAT THE SUN IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY IS SHINING DOWN VERTICALLY UPON OUR HEADS BEN ZOOF WHOSE IDEAS OF DISCIPLINE WERE EXTREMELY RIGID AT ONCE SUGGESTED THAT THE COLONY SHOULD BE PUT UNDER THE SURVEILLANCE OF THE POLICE THAT THE CARDINAL POINTS SHOULD BE PLACED UNDER RESTRAINT AND THAT THE SUN SHOULD BE SHOT FOR BREACH OF DISCIPLINE
WE HAVE COME OUT LIKE A PARTY OF SKIRMISHERS
TEARING A LEAF FROM HIS NOTE-BOOK HE WROTE DOWN THE NAME OF THE COMET THE LIST OF THE FRAGMENTS OF THE EARTH IT HAD CARRIED OFF THE NAMES OF HIS COMPANIONS AND THE DATE OF THE COMET'S APHELION
THOUGH LIGHT AND HEAT WERE NOW REDUCED TO A TWENTY-FIFTH PART OF THEIR TERRESTRIAL INTENSITY SO THAT A PERPETUAL TWILIGHT SEEMED TO HAVE SETTLED OVER GALLIA YET THE POPULATION FELT CHEERED EVEN BY THE LITTLE THAT WAS LEFT AND BUOYED UP BY THE HOPE THAT THEY SHOULD ULTIMATELY REGAIN THEIR PROPER POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE GREAT LUMINARY OF WHICH THE TEMPERATURE HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AS NOT LESS THAN 5,000,000 DEGREES
BUT NEVERTHELESS BY MEANS OF THE LOG WHICH GAVE HIM THE RATE OF PROGRESS AND BY THE COMPASS WHICH INDICATED THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THEY WERE SAILING HE WAS ABLE TO FORM AN ESTIMATE OF HIS POSITION THAT WAS SUFFICIENTLY FREE FROM ERROR FOR HIS IMMEDIATE NEED
IT IS TRUE THAT THERE WILL BE BUT AN INTERVAL OF AN HOUR AND A HALF BETWEEN THEM BUT THE RULE STANDS GOOD--FOUR MEALS A DAY
ROUND GALLIA EAGERLY EXCLAIMED THE PROFESSOR
THAT THE AIR SHRIEKED WITH ALL THE FURY OF A CYCLONE
THUS COURSING RAPIDLY OVER THE ICY PLAIN THE WHOLE PARTY HAD SOON EXCEEDED THE LINE THAT MADE THE HORIZON FROM THE SHORE
THE TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN PASSED AT LEAST IN COMFORT AND PERHAPS IN CONTENTMENT
THE KIND COMPANION OF TERRESTRIAL NIGHT AND HE POINTED TO A DISC THAT WAS RISING AT A SPOT PRECISELY OPPOSITE THE PLACE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE THE SUN
ON THE FIRST MORNING OF THE CRUISE LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WHO LIKE MOST RUSSIANS SPOKE FRENCH FLUENTLY WAS EXPLAINING THESE PECULIARITIES TO CAPTAIN SERVADAC
AFTER THE ENJOYMENT OF SOME REFRESHMENT THE PARTY PROCEEDED TO A GENERAL CONSULTATION AS TO WHAT STEPS MUST BE TAKEN FOR THEIR FUTURE WELFARE
INSTEAD OF BEING ENCLOSED IN A TELESCOPE-CASE IT WAS THIS TIME SECURED IN A PRESERVED-MEAT TIN HERMETICALLY SEALED AND STAMPED WITH THE SAME INITIALS ON THE WAX THAT FASTENED IT
NIL DESPERANDUM ENCHANTE ANOTHER ENIGMA EXCLAIMED SERVADAC
HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND TURNING TO ROSETTE THE CAPTAIN SAID IF SIR I UNDERSTAND RIGHT YOU REQUIRE SOME SILVER FIVE-FRANC PIECES FOR YOUR OPERATION FORTY SAID ROSETTE SURLILY
ONE CONTINGENCY THERE WAS ALMOST TOO TERRIBLE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
DOES NOTHING RHYME WITH SIMPLICITY
WHILE HE WAS GIVING IT HE FREQUENTLY PAUSED AND FROWNED AS IF IRRITATED IN A WAY THAT SEEMED BY NO MEANS JUSTIFIED BY THE PATIENT AND GOOD-HUMORED DEMEANOR OF HIS AUDIENCE
I HAD QUITE RECKONED UPON A SUPPER AND A BED AT ORLEANSVILLE TO-NIGHT SAID SERVADAC AS FULL OF DESPONDENCY HE SURVEYED THE WASTE OF WATER
BUT BAY THERE WAS NONE AND THE TOWN FROM WHICH IT HAD DERIVED ITS NAME WITH THE ARSENAL THE GOLETTA AND THE TWO PEAKS OF BOU-KOURNEIN HAD ALL VANISHED FROM THE VIEW
I HAVE NOTHING HERE FOR ANYONE
GOLD COINAGE TO THE WORTH OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FRANCS WAS HANDED OVER TO THE JEW WHO CLUTCHED AT THE MONEY WITH UNMISTAKABLE EAGERNESS
WHAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM THE JEW DID NOT KNOW
CARRIED ON HIS CALCULATIONS BY DAY HIS OBSERVATIONS BY NIGHT AND VERY RARELY MADE HIS APPEARANCE AMONGST THE REST OF THE LITTLE COMMUNITY
NO ANSWER
THE RIVALS TOOK EACH OTHER BY THE HAND AND WERE UNITED HENCEFORTH IN THE BONDS OF A SINCERE AND CONFIDING FRIENDSHIP
CHAPTER VII
BUT ONE THING NEVERTHELESS IS CERTAIN
PSHAW SAID ROSETTE DISDAINFULLY
NOR DID THESE WAVES IN THE USUAL WAY PARTIALLY UNFURL THEMSELVES AND REBOUND AGAINST THE SIDES OF THE VESSEL
BEFORE ENTERING UPON FURTHER EXPLANATION HE SAID THAT HE COUNTED UPON THE CORDIAL CO-OPERATION OF THEM ALL FOR THE COMMON WELFARE
UPON A STEELYARD OR SPRING-BALANCE DEPENDENT UPON MERE TENSION OR FLEXIBILITY THE ATTRACTION WILL HAVE NO INFLUENCE
NEVERTHELESS THEY OFTEN FOUND THEMSELVES TALKING OVER THE MEASURES THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO ADOPT IF THEY HAD FOUND THEMSELVES PERMANENTLY ATTACHED TO THEIR PRESENT HOME
YOU ARE I ASSURE YOU AT THE PRESENT MOMENT AS MUCH ON ENGLISH SOIL AS IF YOU WERE IN LONDON IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFALGAR SQUARE IT WAS NOW THE TURN OF THE CAPTAIN AND THE COUNT TO LOOK SURPRISED
LET US HOPE THAT AS FRESH DIFFICULTIES ARISE FRESH WAYS OF ESCAPE WILL OPEN
A DIAGRAM REPRESENTING THE ELLIPTICAL ORBIT OF THE PLANET ACCOMPANIED BY AN EPHEMERIS MADE OUT IN MINUTE DETAIL HAD BEEN DRAWN OUT BY THE PROFESSOR
AFTER THE MOST ANXIOUS INVESTIGATION WE COULD DISCOVER ONLY ONE NARROW OPENING IN ALL THE COAST AND IT IS BY FOLLOWING THAT LITTLE CHANNEL THAT WE HAVE MADE OUR WAY HITHER
THERE WAS NO OUTLYING RIDGE ON WHICH A FOOTING COULD BE GAINED
LISTEN SAID SERVADAC
APPARENTLY DISCOVERING NOTHING IN THE ASPECT OF THE STRANGERS TO EXCITE HER APPREHENSIONS THE CHILD SUDDENLY GAINED CONFIDENCE DARTED FORWARDS WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS AND IN A VOICE SOFT AND MELODIOUS AS THE LANGUAGE WHICH SHE SPOKE SAID IN ITALIAN
AFTER HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE NEWLY ARRIVED ASTRONOMER ISAAC HAKKABUT SLUNK BACK AGAIN TO HIS TARTAN
BEASTLY THIEVES
ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW IT HE WAS PROPOSING TO FOLLOW THE PRACTICE OF THE GAULS OF OLD WHO ADVANCED MONEY ON BILLS FOR PAYMENT IN A FUTURE LIFE
NONE OF THE RECENT PHENOMENA HAD ESCAPED HIS NOTICE AND MORE THAN ONCE HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO ENTICE BEN ZOOF INTO CONVERSATION UPON THE SUBJECT
OF HOW MANY COMETS DO YOU KNOW THE MASS AND YET YOU KNOW THEIR MOVEMENTS
HENCE THE DISTANCE BY WHICH THE TWO POLES STOOD APART WOULD BE HALF WHAT HAD BEEN RECKONED WOULD BE THE DISTANCE COMPLETED BY THE DOBRYNA IN HER CIRCUIT
THE SINUOSITIES OF THE COAST LINE ALTERNATELY GULLY AND HEADLAND HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING A DEVIOUS PROGRESS FOR THE TRAVELERS AND AT SUNSET ALTHOUGH THEY HAD ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN TWENTY MILES THEY HAD ONLY JUST ARRIVED AT THE FOOT OF THE MERDEYAH MOUNTAINS WHICH BEFORE THE CATACLYSM HAD FORMED THE EXTREMITY OF THE CHAIN OF THE LITTLE ATLAS
HE HAD ESTIMATED HER DISTANCE FROM THE SUN
IT WAS TO THEM BOTH A SUBJECT OF THE GREATEST PERPLEXITY TO FIND THAT THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN HAD UNDERGONE NO CHANGE BUT THEY COINCIDED IN THE OPINION THAT IT WAS PRUDENT TO KEEP THEIR BEWILDERMENT ENTIRELY TO THEMSELVES
NO BUT I MUST PERSISTED THE PROFESSOR AGAIN
HE WAS FORCED TO CONFESS THAT HIS MEMORY HAD FAILED HIM
CERTAINLY ISAAC WOULD AS SOON THINK OF FLYING AS OF LENDING MONEY TO HIM
IT IS NOT NINE O'CLOCK YET LOOK UP THERE SIR
AND UNLESS SOME MODIFICATION ENSUED IT SEEMED INEVITABLE THAT ALL VEGETATION SHOULD BECOME SCORCHED AND BURNT OFF FROM THE FACE OF THE ISLAND
LIRETTE LIRA
THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO EXPLORE
BOTH WERE EXPLODING WITH LAUGHTER AS THEY URGED THE PERFORMERS TO GREATER AND YET GREATER EXERTIONS IN THE DANCE
AT GOURBI ISLAND THE DAYS AND NIGHTS WERE OF EQUAL LENGTH AND THIS SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT IT WAS SITUATED ON THE EQUATOR
NOT A TRACE ON THE HORIZON WAS LEFT OF THE JURJURA CHAIN THE TOPMOST POINT OF WHICH WAS KNOWN TO HAVE AN ALTITUDE OF MORE THAN 7,000 FEET
UNDER THE OLD CONDITION OF TERRESTRIAL THINGS THE ASCENT OF THIS STEEP ACCLIVITY WOULD HAVE BEEN ATTENDED WITH MUCH FATIGUE BUT AS THE EFFECT OF THE ALTERED CONDITION OF THE LAW OF GRAVITY THE TRAVELERS PERFORMED PERPETUAL PRODIGIES IN THE WAY OF AGILITY AND IN LITTLE OVER AN HOUR REACHED THE EDGE OF THE CRATER WITHOUT MORE SENSE OF EXERTION THAN IF THEY HAD TRAVERSED A COUPLE OF MILES ON LEVEL GROUND
THE WEIGHT OF THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SO REDUCED THAT THERE WAS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE RESISTANCE TO THE EXPLOSIVE FORCE OF THE GASES LIBERATED AT THE CANNON'S MOUTH AND THERE WAS CONSEQUENTLY NONE OF THE REVERBERATION LIKE ROLLING THUNDER THAT ORDINARILY FOLLOWS THE DISCHARGE OF HEAVY ARTILLERY
BEN ZOOF CONTRIBUTED THE FAMOUS ZOUAVE REFRAIN WELL KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE FRENCH ARMY BUT RARELY PERFORMED IN FINER STYLE THAN BY THIS VIRTUOSO MISTI GOTH DAR DAR TIRE LYRE
WE ARE THE FIRST ON THE FIELD HE SAID
THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAD BEFALLEN HIS TELESCOPE WAS A NEVER-ENDING THEME OF COMPLAINT
GO AWAY SUCH WAS THE INHOSPITABLE GREETING WITH WHICH ISAAC HAKKABUT RECEIVED HIS VISITORS
WAS HE AWARE IN SHORT THAT THE ENTIRE MOTIONS OF THE TERRESTRIAL SPHERE HAD UNDERGONE A COMPLETE MODIFICATION
NATURALLY THE CAPTAIN AND BEN ZOOF WERE MOST ANXIOUS THAT THEIR FAVORITE HORSES SHOULD BE SAVED AND ACCORDINGLY BY DINT OF THE GREATEST CARE ALL DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY WERE OVERCOME AND ZEPHYR AND GALETTE WERE CONDUCTED DOWN THE CRATER WHERE THEY WERE INSTALLED IN A LARGE HOLE AND PROVIDED WITH FORAGE WHICH WAS STILL ABUNDANT
AND HOW ABOUT THESE SATELLITES
I BEGIN TO APPREHEND HE SAID THAT YOU MUST BE LA-BORING UNDER SOME STRANGE MISTAKE
SEA AND LAND SEEMED BLENDED INTO ONE DREARY WHITENESS TO WHICH THE PALE BLUE SKY OFFERED SCARCELY ANY CONTRAST
I AM SURE LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WOULD BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO RENDER YOU ANY ASSISTANCE IN THE REVISION SIR SAID THE PROFESSOR BRIDLING UP I WANT NO ASSISTANT
AT NIGHT THE COLD WAS STILL INTENSE BUT IN THE DAYTIME THE SUN HERE FULL UPON THE EQUATOR CAUSED AN APPRECIABLE DIFFERENCE OF 20 DEGREES IN THE TEMPERATURE
THE OLD MAN HAD AGAIN FALLEN BACK INTO A TORPID SLUMBER
PALMYRIN ROSETTE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD IN PERPLEXITY GLARING ROUND UPON HIS COMPANIONS AS IF THEY WERE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ANNOYANCE
NONE OF THAT MISERABLE HOWLING
I BELIEVE SO SAID THE ORDERLY
SO ALSO IS THE EMOTIONAL ASPECT OF THE DEEPS UNDER GROUND THE BLACKNESS THE ENDLESS WANDERING PASSAGES THE SILENCE AND THE AWE OFF ON A COMET OR HECTOR SERVADAC BOOK I
WHY SHOULD HE NOT GO ONCE AGAIN UPON ITS SURFACE INTO THE FAR-OFF REALMS OF SPACE
ISAAC HAKKABUT IMMOVABLE FROM THE PERSONAL OVERSIGHT OF HIS PROPERTY IN THE CAVERN HAD NOT ACCOMPANIED THE PARTY AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS IN BLISSFUL IGNORANCE OF THE FATE THAT THREATENED HIS VESSEL
HAKKABUT'S FUTURE LIFE HOWEVER WAS NOT MANY MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE PRESENT
THE RUSSIANS CONSTITUTIONALLY OF MORE ENDURING TEMPERAMENT DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE SAME EXTENT BUT THE LONG AND DREAR CONFINEMENT WAS BEGINNING TO TELL UPON THEM ALL
BUT WHAT COULD THEY DO
WHY THAT THE DENSITY OF GALLIA IS JUST ABOUT DOUBLE THE DENSITY OF THE EARTH WHICH WE KNOW IS ONLY FIVE KILOGRAMMES TO A CUBIC DECIMETER
PRESENTLY A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS GAVE PASSAGE TO AN OBLIQUE RAY OF LIGHT THAT CLEARLY PROVED THAT THE SUN WAS SETTING IN THE EAST
CAN'T YOU GET ANYBODY TO BUY YOUR STUFFS NOBODY WILL PAY ME A PROPER PRICE WELL OLD SHIMEI YOU WON'T FIND A CUSTOMER HERE
THIEVES IN A MOMENT BEN ZOOF'S HAND WAS CLASPED TIGHTLY OVER HIS MOUTH
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT
PERHAPS EVEN HERE IN THE NORTH WE MAY FIND THAT ITALY AND SICILY AND THE LARGER ISLANDS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN MAY STILL MAINTAIN THEIR EXISTENCE I ENTIRELY CONCUR WITH YOU SAID COUNT TIMASCHEFF
THE NECESSITY WAS BECOMING MORE AND MORE URGENT TO GET AT THE TRUE HOUR OF THE APPROACHING CONTACT BUT THE PROFESSOR SEEMED TO GROW MORE OBSTINATE THAN EVER IN HIS RESOLUTION TO KEEP HIS SECRET
RESCUED AT ALL EVENTS FROM THE EXPOSURE TO A PERILOUS TEMPERATURE OF 60 DEGREES BELOW ZERO THE COMMUNITY WAS INSTALLED IN ITS NEW HOME
IT REMAINED HOWEVER AS REMARKABLE AS EVER HOW COMPLETELY THROUGHOUT THE VOYAGE THE SEA CONTINUED TO BE DESERTED
I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN SAID HE
A BREATH OF WIND A SLIGHT MODIFICATION OF THE TEMPERATURE NOT UNFREQUENTLY SERVING TO BRING ABOUT A SERIES OF CHANGES OUTRIVALING THE MOST ELABORATE TRANSFORMATION SCENES OF A PANTOMIME
THE NUCLEUS OF THE COMET BEING EXCESSIVELY HARD HAS DONE EXACTLY WHAT A BALL WOULD DO FIRED WITH THAT VELOCITY CLOSE TO A PANE OF GLASS
AFTER PONDERING FOR A FEW MOMENTS THE CAPTAIN SPOKE AGAIN
SERVADAC WAS JUST IN THE MOOD TO TAKE PANOFKA'S PART WHICH DREW FROM MAJOR OLIPHANT THE REMARK THAT ENGLAND COULD NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACCIDENTAL INJURY DONE BY HER CANNON AND IF THE RUSSIAN'S LONG NOSE CAME IN THE WAY OF THE BALL THE RUSSIAN MUST SUBMIT TO THE MISCHANCE
BUT EVEN CONCEDING THE POSSIBILITY OF YOUR SUCCESS IN REACHING YOUR DESTINATION WHAT SERVICE DO YOU IMAGINE THAT YOU HALF-STARVED AND HALF-FROZEN YOURSELF COULD RENDER TO THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY PERISHING BY WANT AND EXPOSURE
ON HIS LAST VISIT TO GOURBI ISLAND THE LIEUTENANT HAD ASCERTAINED THAT NORTH EAST AND WEST FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH THE GALLIAN SEA HAD BECOME ONE UNIFORM SHEET OF ICE
ROSETTE MADE NO IMMEDIATE REPLY
WHEN SERVADAC AND HIS COMPANIONS REACHED THE SHORE THEY FOUND THAT THE HANSA HAD ANCHORED IN AN EXPOSED BAY PROTECTED BUT BARELY BY A FEW PROJECTING ROCKS AND IN SUCH A POSITION THAT A GALE RISING FROM THE WEST WOULD INEVITABLY DRIVE HER ON TO THE LAND WHERE SHE MUST BE DASHED IN PIECES
THE LUNAR MONTHS LIKE THE SOLAR DAYS HAD BEEN DIMINISHED BY ONE-HALF
SUSPENSE WHEN THE BALLOON HAD REACHED AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT 2,500 YARDS LIEUTENANT PROCOPE DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN IT AT THAT LEVEL
THIS FRAGMENT MUST BE VERY SMALL
WHERE TAKING A SHARP TURN IT FIRST REACHED A LATITUDE OF 32 DEGREES AND THEN RETURNED AGAIN THUS FORMING A SORT OF IRREGULAR GULF ENCLOSED BY THE SAME UNVARYING BORDER OF MINERAL CONCRETE
AUTHOR OF THE TECHNIQUE OF THE NOVEL ETC
ALL THE PRELIMINARIES HAD BEEN ARRANGED
EIGHT SATELLITES--MIMAS ENCELADUS TETHYS DIONE RHEA TITAN HYPERION AND JAPETUS--ACCOMPANY THE PLANET
THE PROFESSOR LOOKED AT HIM BUT DID NOT VOUCHSAFE A WORD
SERVADAC OLD FELLOW
SURELY THIS WILL INDEFINITELY POSTPONE MY MEETING WITH THE COUNT
CAPTAIN SERVADAC AN ADEPT IN ATHLETICS ALMOST OUTVIED HIS INSTRUCTOR THE COUNT
THE CRATER IT IS TRUE WIDENED OUT INTO A CAVERN SUFFICIENTLY LARGE BUT HERE ITS ACCOMMODATION ENDED
BOTH TRAVELERS WERE WARMLY CLAD THE ORDERLY'S KNAPSACK CONTAINING ALL THE NECESSARY PROVISIONS
BY DINT OF A SERIES OF QUESTIONS HE GAINED FROM THE CHILD A VERY INTELLIGENT ACCOUNT OF HER EXPERIENCES
CAPTAIN SERVADAC KNEW THE COUNTRY WELL
DURING THE SEVEN MONTHS THAT HAD ELAPSED SINCE ITS COLLISION WITH THE EARTH THE COMET HAD BEEN CONTINUOUSLY APPROACHING THE PLANET UNTIL THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS SCARCELY MORE THAN 61,000,000 LEAGUES AND THIS WOULD GO ON DIMINISHING UNTIL THE 15TH OF OCTOBER
THE YACHT I THINK SAID PROCOPE HAD BETTER REMAIN WHERE SHE IS
FOR THE PRESENT AT LEAST LET OUR MAXIM BE NIL DESPERANDUM CHAPTER XVII
AND THE WIDE ROADSTEADS WERE UNPROTECTED AND EXPOSED TO WELL-NIGH EVERY POINT OF THE COMPASS
THE THERMOMETER WAS MORE THAN 20 DEGREES BELOW ZERO AND IT WAS WITH DEEP EMOTION THAT THEIR COMPANIONS BEHELD THEM THUS EMBARKING UPON THE VAST WHITE PLAIN
AT SUNRISE EVERY TELESCOPE WAS POINTED WITH KEENEST INTEREST TOWARDS THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION
IT WAS ON THE 10TH OF MARCH THAT THE CAPTAIN AND LIEUTENANT PROCOPE STARTED OFF ONCE MORE TO INVESTIGATE THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE ISLAND
IN SPITE HOWEVER OF ALL THEIR SANGUINE SPECULATIONS NO SHIP APPEARED
WE MUST SUPPOSE THIS GALLIA OF OURS TO BE A SPHERE AND IF IT IS SO WE MUST NOW BE VERY CLOSE TO HER ARCTIC REGIONS
BUT AS INDICATIONS OF RETURNING SPRING THEY WERE GREETED WITH A WELCOME WHICH NO APPREHENSIONS FOR THE FUTURE COULD PREVENT BEING GLAD AND HEARTY
THEY SCARCELY TOUCHED IT WITH THEIR FEET AND THEIR ONLY FEAR WAS LEST THE HEIGHT TO WHICH THEY WERE PROPELLED WOULD CONSUME THE TIME WHICH THEY WERE SAVING BY THEIR SHORT CUT ACROSS THE FIELDS
AND HE MOVED OFF IN DISGUST
I ONLY KNOW THE SUN IS THERE
THE LADY IS MARRIED LONG AGO
THE WIND GAVE SIGNS ONLY TOO THREATENING OF THE BREEZE RISING TO A GALE
CAN YOU NOT USE YOUR EYES SAID THE PROFESSOR TESTILY
THE GREATEST CARE WAS USED IN OPENING IT AND IT WAS FOUND TO CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE
THE WORD FELL LIKE A THUNDERCLAP UPON THEIR EARS
WOULD YOU DEPRIVE ME OF ONE OF THE MOST INDISPENSABLE OF MY MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD
YOU SHALL KILL ME FIRST BELLOWED THE JEW
THE ORDERLY SHOOK HIS HEAD DUBIOUSLY
NOW NINA DO YOU THINK YOU COULD THROW SOMETHING INTO THE SEA I THINK I COULD REPLIED THE CHILD BUT I AM SURE THAT PABLO WOULD THROW IT A GREAT DEAL FURTHER THAN I CAN NEVER MIND YOU SHALL TRY FIRST PUTTING A FRAGMENT OF ICE INTO NINA'S HAND HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO PABLO
ARE THERE NOT PEOPLE LIVING IN THE OBSERVATORY WHO COULD EXPLAIN ALL THIS VERY LIKELY
THE ONLY CRITICAL MATTER WAS HOW LONG THE COLD SEASON WOULD LAST
IT IS WORTH MORE MUCH MORE
THESE TWO POSTS COMMAND THE ENTRANCE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN BUT SUPPOSING THERE IS NO LONGER ANY MEDITERRANEAN RETORTED THE CAPTAIN GROWING IMPATIENT
ZEPHYR AND GALETTE WERE SOON SADDLED AND IN TWENTY MINUTES HAD CARRIED THEIR RIDERS TO THE WESTERN EXTREMITY OF THE ISLAND WHERE THEY BOTH DISMOUNTED AND BEGAN TO EXPLORE THE COAST
TAKING THE ATTRACTION ON THE EARTH AS 1 THAT ON MERCURY IS 1.15 ON VENUS IT IS.92 ON MARS.5 AND ON JUPITER 2.45
BEN ZOOF HOWEVER DID NOT DESPAIR OF ULTIMATELY CONVERTING THE CAPTAIN AND MEANWHILE HAD RESOLVED NEVER TO LEAVE HIM
SERVADAC PACED RESTLESSLY UP AND DOWN
BUT OF ALGERIA NOT A TRACE REMAINED THE COLONEL CURLED HIS LIP INSINUATING ONLY TOO PLAINLY THAT TO HIM IT WAS BY NO MEANS SURPRISING THAT A FRENCH COLONY SHOULD BE WANTING IN THE ELEMENT OF STABILITY
SUCH THEY READ IS THE GENERAL OUTLINE OF THIS STRANGE APPENDAGE WHICH REVOLVES IN ITS OWN PLANE IN 10 HOURS 32 MINUTES
HIS BARK WAS WORSE THAN HIS BITE
HIS TRUE NAME WAS LAURENT
WE MUST HAVE A SALUTE OF TWENTY-ONE GUNS VERY GOOD REPLIED PIM A MAN OF FEW WORDS
THE PLANETS HAD DEFIED THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION
BUT HIS APPREHENSIONS WERE GROUNDLESS
THE INTENSITY OF THE SOLAR LIGHT AND HEAT TOO WAS VERY SERIOUSLY DIMINISHING ALTHOUGH GOURBI ISLAND BEING ON THE EQUATOR OF AN ORB WHICH HAD ITS AXES ALWAYS PERPENDICULAR TO THE PLANE IN WHICH IT REVOLVED ENJOYED A POSITION THAT GAVE IT A PERMANENT SUMMER
TAKING ALL THESE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT IT WAS AGREED THAT FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD BE DEFERRED TO A MORE FAVORABLE SEASON AND THAT WITHOUT DELAY THE DOBRYNA SHOULD RETURN TO GOURBI ISLAND
BY A SYSTEMATIC COURSE OF WARFARE THE BULK OF THE BIRDS WERE ALL EXPELLED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ABOUT A HUNDRED WHICH BEGAN TO BUILD IN THE CREVICES OF THE ROCKS
CHEAT
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE A MAN ON A ROCK WAVING HIS ARMS IN THE AIR SAID THE ORDERLY
YOU HAVE SOME SAID ISAAC
IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY SAY SO AT ONCE
THE END OF MARCH CAME BUT THE COLD WAS NOT INTENSE TO SUCH A DEGREE AS TO CONFINE ANY OF THE PARTY TO THE INTERIOR OF THEIR RESORT
AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN
THE REST OF THE PARTY FOLLOWED AND WERE SOON IN THE OPEN AIR UPON THE ROCKS THAT OVERHUNG THE SHORE
HAVING ASCERTAINED EVERY POSSIBLE PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS COMET HE WAS NOW DEVOTING HIMSELF WITH EQUAL ARDOR TO THE ANALYSIS OF ALL THE PROPERTIES OF THE SATELLITE NERINA TO WHICH HE APPEARED TO ASSERT THE SAME CLAIM OF PROPRIETORSHIP
THE ADDITION OF A COUPLE OF IRON RUNNERS WOULD BE ALL THAT WAS REQUISITE TO CONVERT IT INTO AN EXCELLENT SLEDGE WHICH IF A SAIL WERE HOISTED MIGHT BE DEEMED CERTAIN TO MAKE A RAPID PROGRESS OVER THE SMOOTH SURFACE OF THE ICE
WHAT SENSATIONAL ARTICLES HE THOUGHT MUST NOW BE TEEMING TO THE NEWSPAPERS
AS TO A COLLISION WITH A COMET THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF ANY SUCH PHENOMENON CROSSING MEN'S MINDS AND AWAKENING AS IT SURELY WOULD A PANIC LITTLE SHORT OF THE CERTIFIED APPROACH OF THE MILLENNIUM
FLITTING ABOUT COAXING ONE TO EAT ANOTHER TO DRINK ROUSING PABLO AS OFTEN AS HE SEEMED YIELDING TO THE COMMON LANGUOR THE CHILD BECAME THE LIFE OF THE PARTY
BUT WHEN AFTER SOME MINUTES HE BECAME CONVINCED THAT WHAT HE SAW WAS ACTUALLY A DISTANT LIGHT HE APPEALED TO ONE OF THE SAILORS BY WHOM HIS IMPRESSION WAS FULLY CORROBORATED
NOTHING FURTHER NOW REMAINED THAN TO APPLY THE INVESTIGATIONS THUS FINISHED TO THE DETERMINING OF THE MASS OR WEIGHT
THE SHORE COINCIDED EXACTLY WITH WHAT HAD BEEN THE RIGHT BANK OF THE SHELIF AND IN A SLIGHTLY CURVED LINE RAN NORTH AND SOUTH WHILST THE ADJACENT GROVES AND MEADOWS ALL RETAINED THEIR PREVIOUS POSITIONS
HIS NAME MIGHT SEEM TO IMPLY THAT HE WAS A NATIVE OF ALGERIA
BUT BEN ZOOF WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE HEWN IN PIECES RATHER THAN ADMIT THAT IT WAS ANYTHING LESS THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET IN HEIGHT
COLONEL HENEAGE FINCH MURPHY AND MAJOR SIR JOHN TEMPLE OLIPHANT STOOD GRAVE AND PRIM FORMALLY AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR VISITORS
I SUPPOSE REMARKED THE COUNT THAT WE CANNOT ATTRIBUTE MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THE LAST LINE
I HAVE YOU FOR A BROTHER AND EVERYBODY IS SO KIND
TO SAY THE TRUTH NO VESSEL COULD HAVE STOOD AGAINST THE WEATHER
WHEN THEY WERE SIX HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE ORIFICE THE MERCURY REGISTERED A TEMPERATURE OF 6 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
SIXTY-SIX POUNDS REPEATED SERVADAC
BUT HERE WAS A PROFESSOR A MERE MAN OF SCIENCE WITH CIRCUMSCRIBED MEANS
IF THE DAYS ARE ONLY HALF AS LONG AS THEY WERE SIXTY OF THEM CANNOT MAKE UP A TWELFTH PART OF GALLIA'S YEAR--CANNOT BE A MONTH I SUPPOSE NOT REPLIED THE CONFUSED CAPTAIN
DURING THE ENSUING DAYS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO PLANETS CONTINUED TO DECREASE AND IT BECAME MORE AND MORE OBVIOUS THAT THE EARTH ON HER NEW ORBIT WAS ABOUT TO CROSS THE ORBIT OF VENUS
THE MOST PRESSING MATTER THAT CAME BEFORE THEM WAS THE CONSIDERATION OF THE MEANS TO BE ADOPTED TO ENABLE THE INHABITANTS OF GALLIA TO SURVIVE THE TERRIBLE COLD WHICH IN THEIR IGNORANCE OF THE TRUE ECCENTRICITY OF THEIR ORBIT MIGHT FOR AUGHT THEY KNEW LAST FOR AN ALMOST INDEFINITE PERIOD
AND THE STILLNESS WHICH HAD ONCE AGAIN FALLEN UPON THEM ALL WAS ONLY BROKEN BY HIS ORDER TO REPLENISH THE STOVE THAT THE MONTGOLFIER MIGHT RETAIN ITS NECESSARY LEVEL
RASCAL
I WILL PAY YOU WELL HE CRIED
HE WOULD PLUNGE INTO THE WILDEST SPECULATIONS IN HIS ENDEAVORS TO UNRAVEL THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE NEW SITUATION AND STRUGGLED INTO A KIND OF CONVICTION THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN A CHANGE OF MANNER IN THE EARTH'S ROTATION ON HER AXIS THERE WOULD BE A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN HER REVOLUTION ROUND THE SUN WHICH WOULD INVOLVE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE LENGTH OF THE YEAR BEING EITHER DIMINISHED OR INCREASED
THAT DECEITFUL STEELYARD HAD BEEN THE MAINSPRING OF HIS FORTUNE
BUT NEITHER SUN MOON NOR STAR EVER APPEARED
WHY SHOULD HE TRUST HIMSELF TO A BALLOON THAT WOULD BLAZE UP LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER
IT CANNOT BE
HIS OCCUPATION MOREOVER WAS NOT SO ENGROSSING BUT THAT HE COULD FIND LEISURE FOR TAKING A SHORT RAILWAY JOURNEY ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK
THIS IS ALL VERY PECULIAR SIR JOHN OBSERVED THE COLONEL
WHAT RETARDED THE WORK WAS THE DENSE FOG WHICH IT HAS BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED AT THAT TIME ENVELOPED NOT ONLY THAT PART OF EUROPE BUT ALMOST THE ENTIRE WORLD
MAY I REQUEST THAT THIS TABLE MAY BE CLEARED BEN ZOOF REMOVED THE VARIOUS ARTICLES THAT WERE LYING ON THE TABLE AND THE COINS WHICH HAD JUST BEEN BORROWED FROM THE JEW WERE PLACED UPON IT IN THREE PILES ACCORDING TO THEIR VALUE
DREARY MONTHS HENCEFORTH THEN WITH A VELOCITY EVER INCREASING GALLIA WOULD RE-APPROACH THE SUN
AND IF THIS WERE SO MIGHT THERE NOT BE REASON TO APPREHEND THAT THEIR ANTICIPATIONS OF COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THE EARTH AT THE SETTLED TIME MIGHT ALL BE FALSIFIED
THE CAPTAIN'S THOUGHTS BEGAN TO TURN TO HIS UNFINISHED RONDO
THE PERIHELION DISTANCE FROM THE SUN WHICH SETTLED THE PRECISE FORM OF THE PARABOLA
AND IN THIS MATTER I DO NOT THINK YOUR IMPERTINENT ORDERLY WILL VENTURE TO PUT MONTMARTRE INTO THE COMPARISON
FOR NOT ONLY WOULD THAT LOW-LYING SHORE BE QUITE INVISIBLE AT SUCH A DISTANCE BUT IT WAS CERTAIN MOREOVER THAT IT LAY TWO DEGREES AT LEAST STILL FURTHER SOUTH
CHAPTER XI
CHAPTER XI
WHEN NEXT HE OPENED HIS EYES CAPTAIN SERVADAC HAPPENED TO BE BENDING DOWN CLOSELY OVER HIM EXAMINING HIS FEATURES WITH CURIOUS SCRUTINY
THE RASCALS
NO TIME MUST BE LOST IN CALCULATING ITS ELEMENTS
THE PRECIPICE WAS PERPENDICULAR AS A WALL ITS TOPMOST HEIGHT CROWNED WITH THE SAME CONGLOMERATE OF CRYSTALLIZED LAMELLAE THAT HAD ALL ALONG BEEN SO PRONOUNCED A FEATURE
WE WILL CONTINUE OUR SEARCH WHILE WE CAN FOR SOME REMAINING FRAGMENT OF EUROPE
THE COMET TRAVELED 50,000,000 LEAGUES DURING THE MONTH AT THE CLOSE OF WHICH IT WAS NOT MORE THAN 78,000,000 LEAGUES FROM THE SUN
THE ORDER THEN WAS AT ONCE GIVEN
HOW IS THIS HAKKABUT
YOU HAD BETTER BE OFF NO
WE SHALL KEEP ON OUR WAY CONTINUOUSLY
THE LIEUTENANT WHO WAS LOST IN THOUGHT MADE NO IMMEDIATE REPLY
IT WOULD SUPPLY THE WORLD WITH ABOUT 246,000 TRILLIONS OF FRANCS IT WOULD MAKE GOLD ABOUT AS CHEAP AS DIRT I SUPPOSE SAID SERVADAC
WE HAVE COME TO ASK A FAVOR IMAGINING THAT AT LEAST HALF HIS PROPERTY WAS TO BE CONFISCATED THE JEW BEGAN TO BREAK OUT INTO HIS USUAL FORMULA ABOUT BEING A POOR MAN AND HAVING NOTHING TO SPARE
LOOK THERE
BUT NOT A DAY NOT AN HOUR WAS TO BE LOST NOW
WE HAVEN'T RECKONED FOR THIS MERCIFUL HEAVENS BEGAN THE JEW
IT HAS ONLY BEEN FOR SIX HOURS BUT YOU MUST MAKE IT ENOUGH ENOUGH IT SHALL BE SIR WAS THE SUBMISSIVE REJOINDER
QUICK OR OUT YOU GO THE AVARICIOUS OLD MAN WAS FOUND TO VALUE HIS LIFE ABOVE HIS MONEY
FEW AS THOSE HOURS WERE THEY SEEMED TO THOSE ON BOARD AS IF THEIR END WOULD NEVER COME
AND WHEN THE STORES OF THE HANSA WERE SAFELY DEPOSITED IN THE GALLERIES OF THE HIVE LIEUTENANT PROCOPE AVOWED THAT HE REALLY FELT THAT HIS MIND HAD BEEN UNBURDENED FROM A GREAT ANXIETY
HERE FOR THE PRESENT THE SPANIARDS WERE LODGED THE RUSSIANS RETAINING THEIR BERTHS UPON THE YACHT WHILE THE JEW WAS PERMITTED TO PASS HIS NIGHTS UPON THE HANSA
AT THE WORD OF COMMAND THEY ADVANCED TO THE SHORE
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T MIND SELLING YOU A LITTLE BUT BY THE HOLY CITY WHY DOES HE MAKE ME PAY FOR WHAT ANYBODY ELSE COULD HAVE FOR NOTHING AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE YOU ARE NOT ANYBODY ELSE
BUT NOT A RIFT APPEARED IN THE LOWERING CLOUDS WHICH SEEMED TO THREATEN TORRENTS OF RAIN
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ALL MY PROPERTY BUT MIND YOU CONTINUED THE CAPTAIN NOT HEEDING THE INTERRUPTION IF YOU DO NOT CHOOSE VOLUNTARILY TO COME WITH US I SHALL HAVE THE HANSA BY MY ORDERS REMOVED TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
IN SPITE HOWEVER OF THE PROFUSE PERSPIRATIONS FROM WHICH HE SUFFERED BEN ZOOF CONSTANT TO HIS PRINCIPLES EXPRESSED NO SURPRISE AT THE UNWONTED HEAT
SAINT LOUIS BLURTED OUT SERVADAC SAVAGELY
AND SO THE FRENCH TRICOLOR RETURNED AS IT HAD SET OUT--IN BEN ZOOF'S KNAPSACK
AND RUSSIA OF COURSE SAID SERVADAC WITH A POLITE BOW
QUITTING THEIR ENCAMPMENT AND RIDING ON THE BEWILDERED EXPLORERS KEPT CLOSE TO THE NEW SHORE
WHENCE CAME IT THAT THE BILLOWS RAGED AND ROSE TO A HEIGHT HITHERTO UNREGISTERED IN THE RECORDS OF SCIENCE
LONDON COPYRIGHT 1911 BY VINCENT PARKE AND COMPANY INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME NINE AMONG SO MANY EFFECTIVE AND ARTISTIC TALES IT IS DIFFICULT TO GIVE A PREFERENCE TO ONE OVER ALL THE REST
AND LONG
YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE CHANCE OF DIGGING OUT ICE-HUTS LIKE THE ESQUIMAUX AS TO REST SAID SERVADAC WE SHALL TAKE NONE
THEY PRESUMED THAT WHEN THE SURFACE OF GALLIA SHOULD BE COVERED BY A THICK LAYER OF ICE WHICH IS A BAD CONDUCTOR OF HEAT A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF WARMTH FOR ANIMAL VITALITY MIGHT STILL BE RETAINED IN EXCAVATIONS OF THIS KIND
BUT THEN WE SHOULD HAVE NO DOGS OR REINDEERS TO DRAW IT WHY NOT ROUGH-SHOE THE TWO HORSES THEY WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO ENDURE THE COLD OBJECTED THE COUNT
IT WAS AN ACKNOWLEDGED IMPOSSIBILITY TO GET ACCESS TO THE CRATER BY THE EXTERIOR DECLIVITIES OF THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE
FROM THE HEAVEN ABOVE WHERE STARS KEPT PEEPING FITFULLY FROM BEHIND THE MOVING CLOUDS HIS EYE WANDERED MECHANICALLY TO THE WATERS BELOW WHERE THE LONG WAVES WERE RISING AND FALLING WITH THE EVENING BREEZE
REACHING THE MOUTH OF THE GALLERY THEY FOUND THE ENTIRE GROUP POINTING WITH EAGER INTEREST TO THE SKY
AND VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MAJOR OLIPHANT WAS OBSERVED TO DRAW UP A LENGTHY DOCUMENT WHICH WAS NO SOONER FINISHED THAN IT WAS FORMALLY SIGNED AND SEALED WITH THE SEAL OF THE 33RD REGIMENT
THE WEATHER REMAINED PERFECTLY FINE THE TEMPERATURE BECAME GRADUALLY COOLER SO THAT THERE WAS LITTLE PROSPECT OF VAPORS ACCUMULATING IN THE ATMOSPHERE
CORPORAL YOU HEAR THE ORDERS IN QUICK TIME AN ARTILLERY-WAGON WAS ON THE SPOT AND THE MEN LIFTED OUT A FULL-SIZED SHOT WEIGHING 200 LBS WHICH UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THE CANNON WOULD CARRY ABOUT FOUR MILES
AND AS HE SPOKE HE REVERENTLY UNCOVERED AN EXAMPLE IN WHICH HE WAS FOLLOWED BY ALL THE REST
TO THE SOUTH THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THE SEA THEY HAD TRAVERSED
HERE WAS THE CRY OF THE POOR FELLOW'S HEART
HAKKABUT
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT IN ORDER TO FIX THE APEX OF HIS TRIANGLE HE HAD TO LINGER ON THE WATCH FOR THE ASSISTANT'S SIGNAL-LIGHT BUT HE DID NOT FORGET THAT HIS PREDECESSORS ARAGO AND BIOT HAD HAD TO WAIT SIXTY-ONE DAYS FOR A SIMILAR PURPOSE
SERVADAC KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THE JEW WAS HOLDING OUT ONLY FOR A GOOD BARGAIN AND ASSURED HIM THAT THE STEELYARD WAS REQUIRED FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO WEIGH A KILOGRAMME WHICH CONSIDERING HOW MUCH LIGHTER EVERYTHING HAD BECOME COULD NOT POSSIBLY PUT THE SLIGHTEST STRAIN UPON THE INSTRUMENT
MONEY GASPED HAKKABUT
WE ARE ANXIOUS TO HEAR ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL US
THIS ARRANGEMENT HOWEVER COULD BE ONLY TEMPORARY
WHERE ON EARTH HAVE YOU BEEN TO ALL THIS TIME
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR SOME LUMINOUS BODY ITS DISC EVIDENTLY OF GIGANTIC DIMENSIONS SHED ITS RAYS UPON THE UPPER STRATA OF THE CLOUDS
HIS OWN PERSONAL AMBITION WAS SO ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN HIS MASTER'S WELFARE THAT IT IS CERTAIN NO OFFER OF PROMOTION--EVEN HAD IT BEEN THAT OF AIDE-DE-CAMP TO THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF ALGIERS--WOULD HAVE INDUCED HIM TO QUIT THAT MASTER'S SERVICE
IF GALLIA THEN SHOULD EVER BECOME ATTACHED TO THE EARTH MIGHT IT NOT BRING ABOUT AN IMPORTANT REVOLUTION IN ALL MONETARY AFFAIRS INQUIRED THE COUNT
WE MUST FORTHWITH COMMENCE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MAKING THIS ISLAND OUR PERMANENT HOME CAPTAIN SERVADAC NOW LED THE WAY TO THE GOURBI WHICH BY HIS SERVANT'S EXERTIONS HAD BEEN ENTIRELY REBUILT
AT A SIGN FROM THE LIEUTENANT A SAILOR WHO WAS STATIONED AT THE FOOT OF THE FORE-SHROUDS DROPPED THE SOUNDING-LEAD INTO THE WATER AND IN REPLY TO PROCOPE'S INQUIRIES REPORTED--"FIVE FATHOMS AND A FLAT BOTTOM THE NEXT AIM WAS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF DEPRESSION ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RIDGE AND FOR THIS PURPOSE THE DOBRYNA WAS SHIFTED FOR A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE BOTH TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT AND THE SOUNDINGS TAKEN AT EACH STATION
TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FRANCS IS IT NOT I DARE SAY IT IS ANSWERED THE PROFESSOR
YOUR HEAD IS TOO LIGHT ALREADY
AS TO ENGLAND THE TOTAL CESSATION OF ALL TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION BETWEEN HER SHORES AND GIBRALTAR WAS A VIRTUAL PROOF THAT ENGLAND WAS BEYOND ITS COMPASS
WHAT WAS IT ALTOGETHER
SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS HERE SAID SERVADAC
LOVERS SHOULD WHOE'ER THEY BE LOVE IN ALL SIMPLICITY BUT WHAT NEXT
UNLESS YOU ARE SURE OF YOUR WHEREABOUTS BEFORE DARK HE SAID YOU WILL NOT FIND IT AFTER
THE LOVELY SCENERY OF PROVENCE WITH THE GRACE OF ITS RICH AND UNDULATING LANDSCAPE
WE REMEMBER THAT OF OLD DON'T WE SIR YOU NEARLY MASTERED THE FIRST ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE DIDN'T YOU SIR A CREDIT TO YOUR CLASS HOLD YOUR TONGUE SIR BELLOWED THE CAPTAIN AGAIN AS IF HIS ANGER WAS UNCONTROLLABLE
AND SO FAR FROM DREADING A FAILURE OF THE INTERNAL HEAT I AM NOT QUITE SURE THAT WE MAY NOT BE EXPOSED TO A MORE TERRIBLE CALAMITY STILL WHAT ASKED SERVADAC
NEITHER WERE THERE ANY OF THE DAMP MISTS OR DRY FOGS WHICH SO OFTEN EXTEND OVER THE POLAR REGIONS OF THE EARTH
DISTANCE DU SOLEIL
WHEN THE OLD JEW HAD AGAIN RECOVERED HIMSELF THE CAPTAIN ADDRESSED HIM
BUT ALGIERS LIKE ALL THE OTHER COAST-TOWNS HAD APPARENTLY BEEN ABSORBED INTO THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH
WHO SHALL REVEAL THE BURNING ANXIETY WITH WHICH HE THROBBED TO SEE BEYOND THAT CRUEL WALL
WE MUST TRY DEEPER DOWN
ONLY THEY MUST LET HER GOAT GO WITH HER
THE 31ST CAME
SPEAK OUT MAN ASK HIM IF HE BRINGS ANY TIDINGS OF EUROPE HAKKABUT BLURTED OUT AT LAST
THE TIME OF MONOPOLY IS THE TIME FOR PROFIT
EVEN PROFESSOR ROSETTE WITH ALL HIS LEARNING HAS NOT A SHADOW OF POWER TO PREVENT THE COMET AND THE EARTH FROM KNOCKING AGAINST EACH OTHER THEN I CANNOT SEE WHAT IS THE USE OF ALL THIS LEARNING THE ORDERLY REPLIED
IT WAS QUITE LIKELY THAT IT WOULD EXCEED THE SIX MONTHS DURATION BY WHICH MANY ARCTIC EXPLORERS HAVE BEEN TRIED
MULTIPLY CIRCUMFERENCE BY DIAMETER RIGHT CRIED ROSETTE
THE OLD MAN HUNG HIS HEAD ABASHED
EVER ON THE LOOKOUT FOR FRESH PHENOMENA CAPTAIN SERVADAC WATCHED THE PREPARATIONS WITH A CURIOUS EYE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE OPPORTUNITY HAS NOT OCCURRED ANSWERED BEN ZOOF FOR ME TO TELL YOU BEFORE BUT I HAVE HAD COMPANY EXPLAIN YOURSELF BEN ZOOF SAID SERVADAC
HISSING AND SPLUTTERING AS THE HOT LAVA CAME IN CONTACT WITH IT THE WATER WAS IN A CONTINUAL STATE OF EBULLITION AND THE FISH THAT ABOUNDED IN ITS DEPTHS DEFIED THE ANGLER'S CRAFT
EVEN TO THE GALLIANS THEMSELVES MUCH AS THEY LOOKED FORWARD TO THE EVENT THE PROSPECT WAS NOT UNMIXED WITH ALARM AND THEY WOULD REJOICE IN THE INVENTION OF ANY DEVICE BY WHICH IT WAS LIKELY THE IMPETUS OF THE SHOCK MIGHT BE DEADENED
BUT I CANNOT PAY FOR A KILOGRAMME EXCEPT I HAVE A KILOGRAMME HAKKABUT PLEADED FOR SOME CONSIDERATION
JUST AS IF HE WERE IN A REGIMENT GOING INTO ACTION HE TALKED WILDLY ABOUT COLUMNS AND SQUARES AND CHARGES THE CAPTAIN ALTHOUGH LESS DEMONSTRATIVE WAS HARDLY LESS EAGER TO REACH THE ROCK
THE SKY WAS ALWAYS CLEAR
GALLIA ECHOED SERVADAC EAGERLY
THE DIFFERENCE OF ONE HALF MINUTE YOU KNOW WOULD SO CERTAINLY MAR THE EXPECTATION OF REUNION WITH THE EARTH AND SEEING A CLOUD GATHERING ON ROSETTE'S FACE HE ADDED
HERE AS LONG AS THE VOLCANO RETAINED ITS ACTIVITY EVERY LIVING CREATURE ON THE NEW ASTEROID MIGHT BRAVE THE MOST RIGOROUS OF CLIMATES
THE COUNT TOOK IT AT THE SAME TIME MAKING A SLIGHT BOW
HE PONDERED THE MATTER OVER FOR A LONG TIME AND ULTIMATELY PERSUADED HIMSELF THAT AFTER ALL THE STORES WERE THE COMMON PROPERTY OF ALL AND THAT HE HAD AS MUCH RIGHT TO A SHARE AS ANYONE ELSE
BUT THE MUSCULAR EFFORT THAT HE MADE CARRIED HIM IN HIS TURN TO AN ALTITUDE OF THIRTY FEET
IT IS NOT THE MOON HE SAID SLOWLY
BUT SUCH WAS BY NO MEANS THE CASE
LATER STILL HALF AN HOUR OR MORE AFTERWARDS THE TORCHES WERE ALL BUT DYING OUT
THE GREATEST SATISFACTION HE COULD HAVE WOULD BE TO INFORM US THAT WE HAD PARTED FROM THE EARTH FOR EVER I TRUST FROM MY VERY SOUL SAID THE COUNT THAT HIS PROGNOSTICATIONS ARE CORRECT THE MORE I SEE OF HIM AND THE MORE I LISTEN TO HIM REPLIED SERVADAC THE MORE I BECOME CONVINCED THAT HIS CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON A SOLID FOUNDATION AND WILL PROVE CORRECT TO THE MINUTEST PARTICULAR BEN ZOOF HERE INTERRUPTED THE CONVERSATION
A STEELYARD HAVE YOU NOT ONE ASKED SERVADAC
BUT TIME ELAPSED AND HERE WAS THE 18TH OF FEBRUARY WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY HAVING BEEN AFFORDED FOR ANY COMMUNICATION WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
VA BENE
VA BENE
VA BENE
THROUGHOUT ALL THE PREPARATIONS WHICH ROUSED EVEN THE SPANIARDS TO ACTIVITY THE JEW STILL INCREDULOUS AND DEAF TO EVERY REPRESENTATION OF THE TRUE STATE OF THINGS INSISTED UPON REMAINING IN THE CREEK AT GOURBI ISLAND
SO COME ALONG
AND YET IF I WERE TO LEAVE THEM ALONE WE SHOULD NOT HAVE A GRAIN OF CORN UPON THE ISLAND IT WAS SOON EVIDENT THAT THE ORDERLY HAD ONLY TOO MUCH CAUSE FOR ALARM
DIDN'T A STRANGER ARRIVE HERE LAST NIGHT INQUIRED THE JEW
BUT IN A FEVER OF FRANTIC EXCITEMENT HE WENT ON TO IMPLORE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE LOAN OF A FEW SAILORS TO CARRY HIS SHIP TO ALGIERS
AND EVERYTHING WAS ABSORBED IN THE ONE IDEA THAT THEY WERE AGAIN WITHIN REACH OF THAT CIRCLE OF HUMANITY FROM WHICH THEY HAD SUPPOSED THEMSELVES SEVERED FOREVER
IT WAS AGREED ON ALL HANDS THAT THE VESSEL MUST BE SHIFTED
SO CLOSE WAS IT THAT THE TWO POLES COULD NOT BE EMBRACED IN ONE FOCUS
WHAT NEW MYSTERY WAS THIS
WITH HEROIC FORTITUDE HE ENDURED THE TORTURES OF THE EXPERIMENT AND GAZED UP INTO THE SKY UNTIL HE WAS NEARLY BLIND
I AM LONGING TO KNOW WHETHER ANYTHING OF ALGERIA IS LEFT BEYOND THE SHELIF
HAD THERE BEEN SUCH A SATELLITE SAID SERVADAC WE MIGHT HAVE CAPTURED IT IN PASSING
A BURNING MOUNTAIN THEY EXCLAIMED
BUT AS IT WOULD AT THE EXPIRATION OF THAT TIME BE EXHAUSTED IT WAS OBVIOUSLY THE PART OF PRUDENCE TO EMPLOY IT IN REACHING A PORT WHERE FUEL COULD BE REPLENISHED
THE TUNNEL HAD OPENED INTO A VAST CAVERN AND THE GLOOM WAS EXCHANGED FOR AN ILLUMINATION THAT WAS PERFECTLY DAZZLING
THE MOTION OF THEIR NOVEL VEHICLE WAS SINGULARLY GENTLE THE OSCILLATION BEING LESS THAN THAT OF AN ORDINARY RAILWAY-CARRIAGE WHILE THE DIMINISHED FORCE OF GRAVITY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SWIFTNESS
AND ANOTHER THING WE SHOULD RUN THE RISK OF BEING SUFFOCATED FOR ALL OUR COMET'S ATMOSPHERE WOULD BE ASSIMILATED WITH THE TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERE AND WE SUPPOSING WE WERE NOT DASHED TO ATOMS SHOULD BE LEFT AS IT WERE UPON THE SUMMIT OF AN ENORMOUS MOUNTAIN FOR SUCH TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES GALLIA WOULD BE 450 MILES ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE WITHOUT A PARTICLE OF AIR TO BREATHE BUT WOULD NOT OUR CHANCES OF ESCAPE BE CONSIDERABLY BETTER ASKED COUNT TIMASCHEFF IN THE EVENT OF EITHER OF THE COMET'S POLES BEING THE POINT OF CONTACT TAKING THE COMBINED VELOCITY INTO ACCOUNT ANSWERED THE LIEUTENANT I CONFESS THAT I FEAR THE VIOLENCE OF THE SHOCK WILL BE TOO GREAT TO PERMIT OUR DESTRUCTION TO BE AVERTED A GENERAL SILENCE ENSUED WHICH WAS BROKEN BY THE LIEUTENANT HIMSELF
THEN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH HE CRIED WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF BEN ZOOF
WORDS MERE WORDS CANNOT AVAIL TELLING TRUE HEART'S TENDER TALE WHAT ON EARTH AILS MY MASTER MUTTERED BEN ZOOF
FAR OTHERWISE WAS IT WITH THE PLANETS
THE LITTLE GRATE CONTAINED THE ASHES OF A FIRE LONG SINCE EXTINGUISHED
AND THIS INTERVAL WAS BEING DIMINISHED AT THE RATE OF NEARLY 208,000 MILES AN HOUR THE SPEED OF THE EARTH BEING ABOUT 70,000 MILES THAT OF THE COMET BEING LITTLE LESS THAN 138,000 MILES AN HOUR
FROM ZENITH TO HORIZON THERE WAS NEVER A CLOUD
MEANTIME THEY WERE BOTH ADVANCING WITH THE UTMOST SPEED
NATIONALITY IS EXTINCT I AM SADLY AFRAID HOWEVER CONTINUED THE COUNT THAT AN ENGLISHMAN WILL BE AN ENGLISHMAN EVER YES SAID THE CAPTAIN THAT IS ALWAYS THEIR FAILING AND THUS ALL FURTHER THOUGHT OF MAKING THEIR WAY AGAIN TO THE LITTLE GARRISON OF GIBRALTAR WAS ABANDONED
INVESTIGATION HOWEVER ALWAYS ENDED IN THE SAME RESULT
BUT I WOULD PAY YOU TO WAKE HIM THE CAPTAIN HAD OVERHEARD THE TENOR OF THE CONVERSATION AND INTERPOSED STERNLY HAKKABUT
TO WITHSTAND THE VERTICAL BEAMS OF THAT NOONTIDE SUN WOULD SEEM TO REQUIRE A SKIN OF BRASS AND A BRAIN OF ADAMANT
EVERYBODY
HAVE YOU PARTED WITH ALL YOUR COFFEE HE ASKED IN A SYMPATHIZING VOICE WHEN BEN ZOOF WAS GONE
AND DO YOU NOT THINK SIR THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT OUR MOON AS THOSE TERRESTRIALS_"--AND HE CURLED HIS LIP AS HE SPOKE WITH A CONTEMPTUOUS EMPHASIS--"KNOW OF THEIRS I BEG PARDON SAID THE CORRECTED CAPTAIN
COUNT TIMASCHEFF COMPLIMENTED THE LIEUTENANT UPON HIS INGENUITY AND BEN ZOOF COULD NOT RESIST BRINGING THE MEETING TO A CONCLUSION BY A RINGING CHEER
WHILE FROM GIBRALTAR TO GOURBI ISLAND WAS SEVEN DEGREES OR BUT LITTLE MORE
IF ON THE OTHER HAND THE COMET HAD EVEN A HUNDREDTH PART OF THE SIZE AND SOLIDITY AND WEIGHT WHICH VERNE CONFERS UPON HIS MONSTER SO AS TO GIVE HIS TRAVELERS A HOME--IN THAT CASE THE COLLISION WOULD BE UNSPEAKABLY DISASTROUS--ESPECIALLY TO THE UNLUCKY INDIVIDUALS WHO OCCUPIED THE EXACT POINT OF CONTACT
NEVER MIND LET US HASTEN ON SAID SERVADAC
IF I TAKE YOUR DEPOSIT IT MUST BE IN GOLD--ALL GOLD
THE COMET WAS PURSUING AN UNALTERED WAY
AND ACCORDINGLY ORDERS WERE GIVEN FOUR RUSSIAN SAILORS WERE SENT ON BOARD AND ONLY A FEW MINUTES ELAPSED AFTER THE DOBRYNA HAD WEIGHED ANCHOR BEFORE THE GREAT LATEEN SAIL OF THE TARTAN WAS UNFURLED AND THE SHOP-SHIP AS BEN ZOOF DELIGHTED TO CALL IT WAS ALSO ON HER WAY TO THE SOUTHWARD
WE HAVE COME TO DO OUR LITTLE BIT OF FRIENDLY BUSINESS WITH YOU YOU KNOW WAS BEN ZOOF'S GREETING
THE LIGHT OF COURSE HAD CEASED TO BE VISIBLE BUT IN THE DIRECTION WHERE IT HAD BEEN SEEN AND AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TEN MILES THERE WAS THE DISTINCT OUTLINE OF A SOLITARY ISLAND OF VERY SMALL EXTENT
THEIR FORMER EXPERIENCE HAD CONVINCED THEM THAT SPADES AND PICK-AXES WERE OF NO AVAIL AND THEIR SOLE RESOURCE WAS TO PROCEED BY BLASTING WITH GUNPOWDER
BEN ZOOF YOU DONKEY
OCCUPATION THEN NEED NEVER BE WANTING AND THE DAILY ROUND OF LABOR COULD GO ON IN ORDERLY ROUTINE
THE BALLOON ROSE WITH STATELY CALMNESS INTO THE AIR
THE GOURBI LEVELED TO THE GROUND HE EXCLAIMED SURELY A WATERSPOUT HAS PASSED ALONG THE COAST HE FELT ALL OVER HIS BODY TO PERCEIVE WHAT INJURIES HE HAD SUSTAINED BUT NOT A SPRAIN NOR A SCRATCH COULD HE DISCOVER
AND YOUR INFERENCE ASKED THE COUNT
THE REST FOLLOWED BUT THEY HAD HARDLY REACHED THE DECK WHEN THE CHINK OF MONEY WAS HEARD IN THE ROOM BELOW
THE FIRST SUPPOSITION THAT THE ROTATORY AXIS OF THE EARTH HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO SOME ACCIDENTAL MODIFICATION AND THE CONJECTURE THAT REPLACED IT NAMELY THAT A CERTAIN PORTION OF THE TERRESTRIAL SPHERE HAD BEEN SPLINTERED OFF AND CARRIED INTO SPACE HAD BOTH NOW TO YIELD TO THE REPRESENTATION THAT THE EARTH HAD BEEN GRAZED BY AN UNKNOWN COMET WHICH HAD CAUGHT UP SOME SCATTERED FRAGMENTS FROM ITS SURFACE AND WAS BEARING THEM FAR AWAY INTO SIDEREAL REGIONS
VERY GOOD
WITHOUT WIFE OR CHILDREN AND HAVING NO SETTLED HOME ISAAC HAKKABUT LIVED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON BOARD THE HANSA AS HE HAD NAMED HIS TARTAN
WE WILL MAKE OUR WAY BACK AT ONCE REPLIED CAPTAIN SERVADAC
PROVISIONS AND FUEL HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN CONVEYED THITHER IN THE BOAT FROM GIBRALTAR BEFORE THE SEA HAD FROZEN AND A SOLID CASEMATE HOLLOWED IN THE ROCK HAD AFFORDED MAJOR OLIPHANT AND HIS CONTINGENT AMPLE PROTECTION FROM THE RIGOR OF THE WINTER
THERE WAS NO DELAY
TRUE WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED THIS BARRIER
ANOTHER DAY ELAPSED BEFORE ANOTHER MOVE WAS MADE
FORTUNATELY FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE ISAAC HAKKABUT WHO AT LENGTH WAS BEGINNING TO REALIZE SOMETHING OF THE TRUE CONDITION OF THINGS CAME FORWARD AT THIS MOMENT AND IN A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EAGERNESS IMPLORED THE PROFESSOR TO TELL HIM WHEN THEY WOULD ALL BE BACK AGAIN UPON THE EARTH
OF THE BALLOON NOT A VESTIGE REMAINED AND CONTRARY TO PREVIOUS COMPUTATION THE COMET HAD MERELY GRAZED THE EARTH AND WAS TRAVERSING THE REGIONS OF SPACE AGAIN FAR AWAY
WE WILL NOT DO THAT
TO THEIR VAST SURPRISE THEY DID NOT MEET A SINGLE HUMAN BEING
BEFORE THE DAYLIGHT ENDED
A COUNTLESS VARIETY OF SEA-BIRDS--WIDGEONS GULLS AND SEAMEWS
IT MIGHT BE IMAGINED THAT THIS REALIZATION OF HIS TRUE POSITION WOULD HAVE LED HIM TO A BETTER MIND AND THAT IN SOME DEGREE AT LEAST HE WOULD HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO REGARD THE FEW FELLOW-CREATURES WITH WHOM HIS LOT HAD BEEN SO STRANGELY CAST OTHERWISE THAN AS MERE INSTRUMENTS TO BE TURNED TO HIS OWN PERSONAL AND PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE
WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE GRANITE AND THE CALCAREOUS DEPOSITS
BUT WE GENTLEMEN HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF
HE TOOK IN ALL SAIL STRUCK HIS TOPMASTS AND RESOLVED TO RELY ENTIRELY ON HIS ENGINE
THE TWO OFFICERS IN COCKED HATS AND FULL STAFF UNIFORM ATTENDED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS
EVEN IF NONE OF THESE CONTINGENCIES OCCUR IN THE WAY WE HAVE CONTEMPLATED I AM DRIVEN TO THE SUSPICION THAT WE SHALL BE BURNT ALIVE BURNT ALIVE THEY ALL EXCLAIMED IN A CHORUS OF HORROR
THE DECOMPRESSION OF THE ATMOSPHERE MADE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THEIR BODIES EXTRAORDINARILY LIGHT AND THEY RAN LIKE HARES AND LEAPED LIKE CHAMOIS
THE HEADLAND ROSE MORE THAN SIXTY FEET ABOVE THE SEA-LEVEL AND THE AZURE WATERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AS THEY SOFTLY KISSED THE STRAND WERE TINGED WITH THE REDDISH HUE OF THE FERRIFEROUS ROCKS THAT FORMED ITS BASE
AND HIS SEASONS ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT INCLINATION OF HIS AXIS TO THE PLANE OF HIS ORBIT ARE EACH OF THE LENGTH OF SEVEN TERRESTRIAL YEARS
I HOPE WE SHALL SHOW THEM BETTER MANNERS WHEN THEY CONDESCEND TO VISIT US AY SAID SERVADAC WE MUST REMEMBER THAT WE ARE ALL ONE PEOPLE NOW
AFTER APPROACHING SO NEAR TO THE SUN AS TO CROSS THE ORBIT OF VENUS THE EARTH MUST NOW HAVE RECEDED SO FAR FROM THE SUN THAT ITS NORMAL DISTANCE OF NINETY-ONE MILLIONS OF MILES WAS GREATLY INCREASED AND THE PROBABILITY WAS GREAT THAT IT WAS APPROXIMATING TO THE ORBIT OF MARS THAT PLANET WHICH IN ITS PHYSICAL CONSTITUTION MOST NEARLY RESEMBLES OUR OWN
AY SIR A GERMAN JEW SAID BEN ZOOF
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE 6TH OF JANUARY THE TWO MEN MADE A FORCED MARCH ALONG THE COAST OF THE MEDITERRANEAN WHICH THEY FOUND LESS ALTERED THAN THE CAPTAIN HAD AT FIRST SUPPOSED
AND IT IS ENGLISH MONEY ENGLISH MONEY ECHOED SERVADAC
WITHOUT LIFTING HIS EYE FROM THE DIAGRAM WHICH HE WAS STILL CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZING SERVADAC SAID I SEE THAT DURING THE MONTH OF MAY GALLIA WILL ONLY TRAVEL 30,400,000 LEAGUES AND THAT THIS WILL LEAVE HER ABOUT 140,000,000 LEAGUES DISTANT FROM THE SUN JUST SO REPLIED THE PROFESSOR
HE MADE A LAMENTABLE OUTCRY ABOUT IT BUT HE UNFASTENED HIS GIRDLE AT LAST AND PUT IT OUT OF THE CAR
NO ONE WHO HAD STUDIED HIS CHARACTER COULD BE MUCH SURPRISED AT THE CONFESSION THAT WAS EXTORTED FROM HIM THAT FOR EVERY SUPPOSED KILOGRAMME THAT HE HAD EVER SOLD THE TRUE WEIGHT WAS ONLY 750 GRAMMES OR JUST FIVE AND TWENTY PER CENT
THERE WAS NO VISITOR TO THE HIVE MORE REGULAR THAN ROSETTE
YOUR ISLAND IS THE FIRST LAND WE HAVE SEEN THEN LET US PUT OUT TO SEA AT ONCE AND ASCERTAIN THE EXTENT OF THE DISASTER CRIED THE CAPTAIN EAGERLY
TAKE HIM AWAY FURTHER YET FOR SPACE IS INFINITE AND HE SHALL BE A SPECTATOR OF THE CREATION OF THE SPHERES
BUT THEY REQUIRED TO KNOW MORE THAN THE GENERAL TRUTH AND FELT THAT THEY HAD NO TIME TO LOSE IN GETTING AT THE EXACT DETAILS
I QUITE THINK WE OUGHT TO MAKE OUR SURVEY OF THE CONFINES OF THIS NEW BASIN AS COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE BEFORE WE WITHDRAW SERVADAC ALTHOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE JUSTNESS OF THESE OBSERVATIONS COULD NOT HELP PLEADING THAT THE EXPLORATIONS MIGHT BE DEFERRED UNTIL AFTER A VISIT HAD BEEN PAID TO GOURBI ISLAND
IF YOU WERE ANYBODY ELSE I SHOULD KNOW VERY WELL WHAT TO DO
TOTAL ANNIHILATION MIGHT NOT ACCORD WITH HIS VIEWS BUT HE WOULD BE QUITE CONTENT FOR GALLIA TO MISS ITS MARK WITH REGARD TO THE EARTH INDIFFERENT WHETHER IT REVOLVED AS A NEW SATELLITE AROUND JUPITER OR WHETHER IT WENDED ITS COURSE THROUGH THE UNTRAVERSED REGIONS OF THE MILKY WAY
NO WONDER THAT PALMYRIN ROSETTE CARED SO LITTLE TO QUIT HIS OBSERVATORY
THE RUSSIANS UNDERTOOK THE INSTRUCTION OF THE SPANIARDS AND AT THE END OF A FEW DAYS DURING WHICH THE TEMPERATURE WAS ONLY ENDURABLE THROUGH THE ABSENCE OF WIND THERE WAS NOT A GALLIAN WHO COULD NOT SKATE TOLERABLY WELL WHILE MANY OF THEM COULD DESCRIBE FIGURES INVOLVING THE MOST COMPLICATED CURVES
ISN'T HER VELOCITY ALL ALTERED DEMANDED THE CAPTAIN
PLAGUE ON IT MUTTERED SERVADAC
THE ONLY INTELLIGIBLE WORDS WHICH THE ASTRONOMER HAD UTTERED HAD BEEN MY COMET TO WHAT COULD THE EXCLAMATION REFER
THE 15TH OF JANUARY DAWNED
NO OLD ZEBULON SAID BEN ZOOF STEADILY REFUSING THE GIFT IT IS AGAINST ORDERS TO TAKE ANYTHING FROM YOU
MEANWHILE SERVADAC WAS DOING HIS UTMOST--IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH INDIFFERENT SUCCESS--TO RECALL THE LESSONS OF HIS SCHOOL-DAYS
HE CONSEQUENTLY BROUGHT UPON HIMSELF THE FULL FORCE OF THE PROFESSOR'S WRATH
WHAT NEWS CAN YOU GIVE US OF FRANCE ENGLAND OR RUSSIA CONTINUED SERVADAC PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE STOLID RIGIDITY WITH WHICH HIS ADVANCES WERE RECEIVED
AND NOTHING MORE THAN A FEW CIRRI ALMOST TRANSPARENT VEILED HERE AND THERE THE CLEAR AZURE OF THE SKY
HE WAS A GOOD DRAUGHTSMAN AN EXCELLENT RIDER--HAVING THOROUGHLY MASTERED THE SUCCESSOR TO THE FAMOUS UNCLE TOM AT THE RIDING-SCHOOL OF ST CYR--AND IN THE RECORDS OF HIS MILITARY SERVICE HIS NAME HAD SEVERAL TIMES BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ORDER OF THE DAY
THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY FROM THE SHELIF TO THE CHAIN OF THE LITTLE ATLAS TWENTY-ONE MILES
THE QUESTION WAS CONTINUALLY BEING ASKED WHAT DOES THE PROFESSOR REALLY THINK OUR FRIEND THE PROFESSOR SAID SERVADAC IS NOT LIKELY TO TELL US VERY MUCH
I MUST HAVE GOLD
THE LIEUTENANT HESITATED
I HAVE TOLD YOU ONCE I SHALL PAY FOR ALL I BUY READY MONEY ASKED HAKKABUT
IT WAS NOW VISIBLE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
THE TASK HOWEVER WAS BROUGHT TO AN END WITHOUT ACCIDENT OF ANY KIND
ANOTHER WORLD WAS NOW BECOMING A CONSPICUOUS OBJECT IN THE HEAVENS AND PALMYRIN ROSETTE AFTER REJOICING IN AN APPROACH NEARER TO JUPITER THAN ANY OTHER MORTAL MAN HAD EVER ATTAINED WAS NOW TO BE PRIVILEGED TO ENJOY A SIMILAR OPPORTUNITY OF CONTEMPLATING THE PLANET SATURN
WHEN THE RUBBING HAD BEEN CONTINUED WITHOUT A MOMENT'S INTERMISSION FOR THE BEST PART OF HALF AN HOUR THE ASTRONOMER HEAVED A FAINT SIGH WHICH ERE LONG WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER AND ANOTHER
ANYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE HURRIED FROM THE SOLITUDE OF FORMENTERA IN SHEER FRIGHT
THE DESCENT WAS CONTINUED FOR ABOUT ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED FEET WHICH BROUGHT THE EXPLORERS TO A TOTAL DEPTH OF NINE HUNDRED FEET FROM THEIR OLD QUARTERS
THE SAILS OF THE DOBRYNA WHICH HAD ALL BEEN CAREFULLY STOWED AWAY IN THE HIVE WERE OF A TEXTURE UNUSUALLY CLOSE AND QUITE CAPABLE OF BEING MADE AIRTIGHT BY MEANS OF A VARNISH THE INGREDIENTS OF WHICH WERE RUMMAGED OUT OF THE PROMISCUOUS STORES OF THE TARTAN
WE WILL LEAVE THE BANK NOTES FOR BY AND BY THE JEW'S COUNTENANCE BRIGHTENED AND SERVADAC REPEATING THAT HE SHOULD COME AGAIN THE NEXT DAY WAS ABOUT TO QUIT THE VESSEL
THE MARITIME TOWN OF DELLIS BUILT LIKE ALGIERS AMPHITHEATER-WISE HAD TOTALLY DISAPPEARED
EVEN UPON THE SUPPOSITION THAT AT SOME FUTURE DATE THE WHOLE POPULATION SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO UNITE AND FIND A RESIDENCE UPON GOURBI ISLAND THERE DID NOT APPEAR ANY REASON TO QUESTION BUT THAT EIGHT HUNDRED ACRES OF RICH SOIL UNDER GOOD MANAGEMENT WOULD YIELD THEM ALL AN AMPLE SUSTENANCE
OH YOUR EXCELLENCY MY LORD I DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WAS YOU WHINED THE JEW BUT WITHOUT EMERGING ANY FARTHER FROM HIS CABIN
BUT NO ADVANTAGE OF THIS KIND COULD COMPENSATE FOR THE REMOTENESS OF THE SUN
TO HAVE STABLED THEM ALL IN THE CAVERN BELOW WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IMPOSSIBLE WHILST TO HAVE LEFT THEM IN THE UPPER GALLERIES WOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN TO ABANDON THEM TO A CRUEL DEATH
WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE FAITH WHICH HAS HITHERTO CARRIED YOU SO BRAVELY THROUGH ALL OUR DIFFICULTIES THE COUNT SHOOK HIS HEAD AS IF IN DESPAIR AND SAID SADLY THE HAND THAT HAS HITHERTO BEEN OUTSTRETCHED TO HELP SEEMS NOW TO BE WITHDRAWN BUT ONLY TO TEST OUR POWERS OF ENDURANCE REJOINED THE CAPTAIN EARNESTLY
FIVE MINUTES MORE AND COLLISION MUST ENSUE
WITH HER STEAM AT HIGH PRESSURE THE YACHT MADE RAPID PROGRESS TOWARDS THE EAST
NOTHING COULD BE MORE DEJECTED THAN THE ASPECT OF THAT FROZEN SEA
COULD THEY BE WRONG IN IMAGINING THAT THEY HAD REACHED THE IONIAN ISLANDS
CARRY HIM AWAY FURTHER STILL TO A STAR SO REMOTE THAT IT REQUIRES SOMETHING LESS THAN NINETEEN CENTURIES FOR LIGHT TO REACH IT AND HE WOULD BE A WITNESS OF THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF CHRIST
CONFOUND IT SAID BEN ZOOF
I DON'T WANT TO INTRUDE OBSERVED BEN ZOOF BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SUCH LEARNED GENTLEMEN AS YOU CANNOT MAKE THE COMET GO WHERE YOU WANT IT TO GO YOU ARE MISTAKEN BEN ZOOF ABOUT OUR LEARNING SAID THE CAPTAIN
IT WAS IN SIGHT BUT SO NEAR TO THE HORIZON AS TO SUGGEST THE UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY OF ITS BEING ANY LONGER THE CENTRAL PIVOT OF THE SIDEREAL SYSTEM
CONCEAL IT AS THEY WOULD A COOLNESS WAS UNDENIABLY STEALING OVER AN INTIMACY WHICH THOUGH IT COULD NEVER BE CALLED AFFECTIONATE HAD BEEN UNIFORMLY FRIENDLY AND COURTEOUS
IN FACT WE HAVE LEFT THE OLD WORLD ENTIRELY
AN UNEXPECTED POPULATION THE DOBRYNA WAS NOW BACK AGAIN AT THE ISLAND
BOTH OF THEM WERE TALL AND FAIR WITH BUSHY WHISKERS AND MUSTACHES
TO WHAT QUARTER OF EUROPE IF EUROPE STILL EXISTS DO YOU PROPOSE THAT I SHOULD NOW DIRECT YOUR COURSE TO SICILY ITALY FRANCE EJACULATED SERVADAC EAGERLY,--"ANYWHERE WHERE WE CAN LEARN THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAS BEFALLEN US HOW IF WE ARE THE SOLE SURVIVORS SAID THE COUNT GRAVELY
ROSETTE MEANWHILE HAD BEEN LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION AND SECRETLY REJOICING THAT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN WATCHING HAD ARRIVED
GALLIA AB SOLE AU 1 MARS DIST
FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO KNOW ALMOST TO A MINUTE THE PRECISE TIME AT WHICH THE COLLISION WOULD OCCUR AND CAPTAIN SERVADAC UNDERTOOK THE TASK BY GENTLE MEANS OR BY STERN OF EXTRACTING THE SECRET FROM THE PROFESSOR
I WAS PERFECTLY JUSTIFIED IN HAVING YOUR GOODS PUT TO THE TEST SAID SERVADAC QUITE SERIOUSLY
OF THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE REPRESENTATIVE
WHY AFRAID BECAUSE WE ARE DOING EXCEEDINGLY WELL AS WE ARE THE PROFESSOR STAMPED HIS FOOT UPON THE GROUND BY WAY OF EMPHASIS AND ADDED IF I HAD MY WILL GALLIA SHOULD NEVER RETURN TO THE EARTH AGAIN CHAPTER IV
IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS THAT HE HAD FIRST MET MADAME DE L THE LADY TO WHOM HE WAS DESIROUS OF DEDICATING THE RONDO THE FIRST FOUR LINES OF WHICH HAD JUST SEEN THE LIGHT
WITHOUT ANY WARNING DAY GAVE PLACE TO NIGHT AND EARTH SEA AND SKY WERE IMMEDIATELY WRAPPED IN PROFOUND OBSCURITY
BUT WITHOUT COMMUNICATING A WORD OF HIS STARTLING DISCOVERY HE REMAINED RESOLUTELY AT HIS POST
THE TIME FOR THE CORN AND FRUIT HARVEST HAD FALLEN SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THAT OF THE HAYMAKING
THIS PARTY OF THIRTEEN MEN WERE APPARENTLY THE SOLE SURVIVORS OF AN OVERWHELMING CATASTROPHE WHICH ON THE 1ST OF JANUARY HAD TRANSFORMED AN ENORMOUS ROCK GARRISONED WITH WELL-NIGH TWO THOUSAND TROOPS INTO AN INSIGNIFICANT ISLAND FAR OUT TO SEA
GIBRALTAR
GIBRALTAR
AN HOUR AFTER SUNRISE ON NEW YEAR'S DAY FRENCHMEN RUSSIANS SPANIARDS AND LITTLE NINA AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF ITALY SAT DOWN TO A FEAST SUCH AS NEVER BEFORE HAD BEEN SEEN IN GALLIA
IT IS THE OLD COAST AND NOT THE NEW THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRACING
MEANWHILE THE LAST TORCH HAD FLICKERED OUT
THE STORES OF THE DOBRYNA CONTAINED SOME EXCELLENT WINE SOME OF WHICH WAS BROACHED TO DO HONOR TO THE OCCASION
HOLD YOUR TONGUE REPEATED SERVADAC
THEN YOU AND I SHALL BE MAN AND WIFE WE HAVE BEEN AS GOOD AS THAT FOR A LONG TIME OBSERVED BEN ZOOF GRAVELY
THE SECOND WAS BLUE
THE SOUND OF THE SCUFFLING HOWEVER DREW THE ATTENTION OF SERVADAC WHO FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANIONS HASTENED TO THE SCENE
BUT IT MIGHT ALMOST SEEM THAT THE DESIGNER OF THE UNIVERSE IN PERMITTING ITS EXISTENCE HAD BEEN WILLING TO IMPART TO HIS INTELLIGENT CREATURES THE MANNER IN WHICH CELESTIAL BODIES ARE EVOLVED AND THAT THIS REMARKABLE RING-SYSTEM IS A REMNANT OF THE NEBULA FROM WHICH SATURN WAS HIMSELF DEVELOPED AND WHICH FROM SOME UNKNOWN CAUSE HAS BECOME SOLIDIFIED
AFTER ALL THEY WERE PRACTICALLY A THOUSAND TIMES FURTHER OFF THAN THE GREAT ASTRONOMERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO APPROACH BY MEANS OF THEIR GIANT TELESCOPES
SO PRETTY
4
NOTHING COULD BE NOTICED TO INDICATE THAT ANY ABNORMAL INCIDENT HAD EITHER TRANSPIRED OR BEEN EXPECTED BY THE INHABITANTS
BUT NEVER MIND FOR ONE DAY YOU SHALL HAVE IT
THAT IS ALL NONSENSE
I HAVE OMITTED THE DESIGNATION V
IF UNFORTUNATELY IT SHOULD COME DOWN IN MID-OCEAN NOTHING BUT THE HAPPY CHANCE OF SOME PASSING VESSEL COULD SAVE THEM ALL FROM THE CERTAIN FATE OF BEING DROWNED
SO IN ASCERTAINING THE ELEMENTS OF A COMET THREE DIFFERENT POSITIONS MUST BE OBSERVED BEFORE WHAT ASTRONOMERS CALL ITS EPHEMERIS CAN BE ESTABLISHED
ONE OF THEM PLAYED THE GUITAR ANOTHER THE CASTANETS AND THE REST JOINED IN A RINGING CHORUS
HE LOVED THE OPEN AIR AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF HIS LIFE SUITED HIM WELL
WHAT UNDREAMED-OF MARVELS MIGHT NOT HAVE REVEALED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIS GAZE
THE 1ST OF JANUARY IT IS TRUE WAS NOT PROPERLY NEW YEAR'S DAY IN GALLIA BUT CAPTAIN SERVADAC NEVERTHELESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT OBSERVED AS A HOLIDAY
BUT WHAT IF THE OWNER REFUSES TO PART WITH IT NO FEAR
AS YET WE CANNOT SAY POSITIVELY THAT THERE IS NO OUTLET TO THE SOUTH
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT HE HAD NOT MISTAKEN HIS DIRECTION
A CONTINUOUS RUMBLING THAT INCREASED AS THEY ADVANCED MADE THEM AWARE THAT THEY MUST BE APPROACHING THE CENTRAL FUNNEL OF THE VOLCANO
HERE SIR AND WITH MILITARY PROMPTITUDE A SECOND HEAD PROTRUDED FROM THE RUBBISH
BUT DURING THAT NIGHT THE COMMUNITY THOUGHT THAT THEIR LAST HOUR HAD TAKEN THEM UNAWARES
HE HAD CONSTITUTED HIMSELF SICK NURSE AND CONSIDERED HIS REPUTATION AT STAKE IF HE FAILED TO SET HIS PATIENT ON HIS FEET AGAIN
AND BEN ZOOF WHO WAS ESPECIALLY ANXIOUS THAT THE REPOSE WHICH PROMISED TO BE SO BENEFICIAL SHOULD NOT BE DISTURBED FELT CONSIDERABLE ANNOYANCE AT HEARING A LOUD KNOCKING EVIDENTLY OF SOME BLUNT HEAVY INSTRUMENT AGAINST A DOOR THAT HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GALLERY MORE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RETAINING INTERNAL WARMTH THAN FOR GUARDING AGAINST INTRUSION FROM WITHOUT
YES IT IS ONLY TOO CLEAR
GALLIA WAS THE WORD WRITTEN AT THE TOP OF EVERY ONE OF THEM AND GALLIA WAS THE FIRST WORD UTTERED BY HIM IN OUR HEARING THE ASTRONOMER SLEPT ON
AFTER PATIENT OBSERVATION HE SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THE REQUIRED CONDITIONS WERE ANSWERED BY A CERTAIN STAR THAT WAS STATIONARY NOT FAR FROM THE HORIZON
WHATEVER TOPIC MIGHT BE STARTED IT SEEMED SOON TO SETTLE DOWN UPON THE HUGE ORB THAT WAS LOOMING UPON THEM WITH SUCH THREATENING ASPECT
AND I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW YOU WOULD PROPOSE TO GET THERE WHY ON SKATES OF COURSE
THE SPANIARDS COULD HARDLY BE ROUSED TO QUIT THEIR BEDS AND SEEMED TO HAVE SCARCELY ENERGY ENOUGH TO EAT
THE NIGHT WAS MAGNIFICENT
DURING THE LAST FORTNIGHT THE HIGH TEMPERATURE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY DIMINISHING UNTIL IT NOW REACHED AN AVERAGE OF 20 DEGREES CENT
THE WAY IN WHICH HIS ADVANCE WAS RECEIVED THE GOOD ORDERLY NEVER DIVULGED BUT HENCEFORWARD HE MAINTAINED THE FIRM CONVICTION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY MUCH AMISS UP IN THE SKY
ACCORDING TO THE OLD CALENDAR JUNE HAD NOW ARRIVED
I CANNOT COLLECT MY THOUGHTS WITHOUT MY COFFEE FORTUNATELY BEN ZOOF APPEARED WITH A GREAT CUP HOT AND STRONG
FLAC
BY THIS TIME FOUR OTHER MEN HAD MADE THEIR APPEARANCE FROM THE UPPER PART OF THE ROCK
AND ALTHOUGH THE YOUNG WIDOW WAS ALL UNCONSCIOUS OF THE SHARE SHE HAD IN THE MATTER IT WAS SHE AND SHE ALONE WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF THE CHALLENGE JUST GIVEN AND ACCEPTED BY HER TWO ARDENT ADMIRERS
THE COMMUNICATION WAS RECEIVED BY ALL ALIKE WITH THE MOST SUPREME INDIFFERENCE
ITS OUTLINE WAS CLEARLY MARKED AGAINST THE SKY AND ITS SUBSTANCE SMOOTH AND POLISHED AS THOUGH FRESH FROM A FOUNDER'S MOLD GLITTERED WITH THE METALLIC BRILLIANCY THAT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF PYRITES
COUNT TIMASCHEFF WAS HIMSELF NO SAILOR BUT HAD THE GREATEST CONFIDENCE IN LEAVING THE COMMAND OF HIS YACHT IN THE HANDS OF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE A MAN OF ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE AND AN EXCELLENT SEAMAN
VERY SORRY YOU KNOW HAKKABUT
AND YOU MUST SUBMIT TO THE GOVERNMENT WHICH I PLEASE TO ORDAIN AND WHO TOLD YOU THAT GALLIA IS NOT GOING BACK TO THE EARTH ASKED THE PROFESSOR WITH A LOOK OF WITHERING SCORN
BUT HOWEVER INTERESTING IT MIGHT BE OBSERVED THE COUNT TO KNOW THE AUTHOR OF THE LINES TO US IT IS OF FAR GREATER MOMENT TO ASCERTAIN THEIR MEANING AND TAKING UP THE PAPER AGAIN HE SAID PERHAPS WE MIGHT ANALYZE IT WORD BY WORD AND FROM ITS DETACHED PARTS GATHER SOME CLUE TO ITS SENSE AS A WHOLE WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF ALL THAT CLUSTER OF INTERROGATIONS AFTER GALLIA ASKED SERVADAC
ACCORDING THEN TO THIS NEW CALENDAR IT ISN'T THE MIDDLE OF MAY AT ALL
WE IMAGINE THAT WE ARE ON A CONSIDERABLE FRAGMENT OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE THAT HAS BEEN DETACHED BY COLLISION WITH A PLANET TO WHICH YOU APPEAR TO HAVE GIVEN THE NAME OF GALLIA BETTER THAN THAT CRIED ROSETTE STARTING TO HIS FEET WITH EXCITEMENT
IN THE SECOND PLACE SUPPOSING YOU TRAVEL AT THE RATE OF TWENTY LEAGUES A DAY YOU WOULD BE EXPOSED FOR AT LEAST SIX CONSECUTIVE DAYS
TO HIM IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE EARTH SHOULD REMAIN IN SIGHT AND IT WAS HIS GREAT CONSOLATION THAT HITHERTO HIS NATIVE SPHERE HAD NEVER VANISHED FROM HIS GAZE
YOU MAY GROOM THEM AND SADDLE THEM AS QUICKLY AS YOU LIKE
ITALY AS IT WERE A FOOT AND LEG ENCASED IN A TIGHT-FITTING BOOT WAS JUGGLING DEFTLY WITH THE ISLANDS OF SICILY SARDINIA AND CORSICA
YOU SHALL HAVE IT FOR THE SAME PRICE THAT WE PAID FOR IT
AND THIS AFFORDS AN ADEQUATE EXPLANATION OF OUR DAYS AND NIGHTS BEING THUS CURTAILED
THEIR HOOFS SCARCELY TOUCHED THE GROUND AND THEY SEEMED TRANSFORMED FROM ORDINARY QUADRUPEDS INTO VERITABLE HIPPOGRIFFS
ARAGO HAS FIXED TWENTY-FIVE OR TWENTY-SIX FEET AS THE MAXIMUM ELEVATION EVER ATTAINED BY THE HIGHEST WAVES AND HIS ASTONISHMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GREAT TO SEE THEM RISING FIFTY OR EVEN SIXTY FEET
I HAVE MADE MY RECKONING AS FAR AS GALLIA IS CONCERNED
NOT ONLY HAS HE ADOPTED OUR MOTTO NIL DESPERANDUM BUT SEE HOW ENTHUSIASTICALLY HE HAS WOUND UP WITH HIS ENCHANTE THE CONVERSATION DROPPED
HE COULD NOT ABSOLUTELY DENY THAT SOME PORTIONS OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE HAD UNDERGONE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF MODIFICATION BUT NOTHING COULD BRING HIM TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS NOT SOONER OR LATER TO RESUME HIS OLD LINE OF BUSINESS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
AS FOR BEN ZOOF HE WAS HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE HIS IMPERTURBABLE GOOD TEMPER ENSURING HIM A SMILE OF WELCOME WHENEVER HE APPEARED
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
NO CAPTAIN INTERPOSED LIEUTENANT PROCOPE
AUSTRIA RESEMBLED A HUGE CAT CURLED UP AND SLEEPING A WATCHFUL SLEEP
THEY LONGED TO INQUIRE BUT DID NOT YET VENTURE TO ASK HIM
INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE NORTHERN SHORE OF THE ISLAND BEN ZOOF CUT OBLIQUELY ACROSS THE PLAIN
THEY GALLOPED OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SHELIF AND WERE NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING THAT THE DIMINUTION IN THE PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE HAD PRECISELY THE SAME EFFECT UPON THEIR HORSES AS IT HAD HAD UPON THEMSELVES
THE STARS WOULD ONLY GIVE SOMETHING OF THAT PALE RADIANCE WHICH THE POET CORNEILLE HAS DESCRIBED
THE SUN WAS RISING IN THE EAST
BUT AS IT WAS IT WAS MORE CONVENIENT TO BRING THE COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL TO THE BALLOON
IT SHONE WITH ABOUT THE SAME DEGREE OF LUSTER AS A STAR OF THE SECOND MAGNITUDE AND FROM THE FACT OF ITS REMAINING STATIONARY PROCOPE BECAME MORE AND MORE CONVINCED THAT IT WAS ON LAND AND DID NOT BELONG TO A PASSING VESSEL
THE ORDERLY MADE AN EQUALLY POLITE BOW AND FOLLOWED HIS MASTER
THAT MAGNIFICENT PLANET WHICH--AS PHOSPHORUS OR LUCIFER HESPERUS OR VESPER THE EVENING STAR THE MORNING STAR OR THE SHEPHERD'S STAR--HAS NEVER FAILED TO ATTRACT THE RAPTUROUS ADMIRATION OF THE MOST INDIFFERENT OBSERVERS HERE REVEALED HERSELF WITH UNPRECEDENTED GLORY EXHIBITING ALL THE PHASES OF A LUSTROUS MOON IN MINIATURE
BUT NOTHING COULD GIVE HIM ANY SATISFACTION WHILE HE KNEW THAT THE DAYS WERE PASSING AND THAT HE WAS DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING OUT HIS CAPITAL IN ADVANTAGEOUS INVESTMENTS OR SECURING A PROPER INTEREST
BUT IN THE NAME OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL I ASK YOU TO SEE JUSTICE DONE THE CAPTAIN GLANCED INQUIRINGLY TOWARDS BEN ZOOF AND THE ORDERLY BY A SIGNIFICANT NOD MADE HIS MASTER UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS TO PLAY THE PART THAT WAS IMPLIED BY THE TITLE
THE WORK WAS COMMENCED
THE LAST OF THE THREE MYSTERIOUS DOCUMENTS HAD REPRESENTED THAT GALLIA IN CONFORMITY WITH KEPLER'S SECOND LAW HAD TRAVELED ALONG HER ORBIT DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH TWENTY MILLIONS OF LEAGUES LESS THAN SHE HAD DONE IN THE PREVIOUS MONTH
ON GALLIA ASKED THE CAPTAIN
AFTER THE SILENCE WAS BROKEN THEY CONSULTED AS TO WHAT COURSE WAS BEST TO PURSUE
MAJOR OLIPHANT I BELIEVE SAID SERVADAC WITH A COURTEOUS BOW
IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE SAID LIEUTENANT PROCOPE
HE IS NO DOUBT THE AUTHOR OF THE PAPERS AND WE MUST HOPE THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE US SOME VALUABLE INFORMATION BEYOND A QUESTION THE DOCUMENTS HAVE ORIGINATED WITH HIM ASSENTED THE LIEUTENANT
THE RECEPTION THEY GAVE US WAS NOT SO CORDIAL THAT WE NEED PUT OURSELVES OUT OF THE WAY TO REPEAT OUR VISIT WHAT YOU SAY IS TOO TRUE REPLIED THE COUNT
THE COMPANY WAS MORE THAN CONTENTED--IT WAS AS JOVIAL AS BEN ZOOF COULD DESIRE
BEN ZOOF ALONE VENTURED AN UNLUCKY REMARK TO THE EFFECT THAT IF THE COMET HAD HAPPENED TO STRIKE AGAINST MONTMARTRE INSTEAD OF A BIT OF AFRICA IT WOULD HAVE MET WITH SOME RESISTANCE
I AM BUT A POOR MAN NONE OF THAT HAKKABUT
THERE WAS NOTHING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FERTILE SHORES RICH IN VEGETATION BEING TRANSFORMED INTO ROCKS ARID AND BARREN BEYOND PRECEDENT
THEN SURELY YOU WILL NOT OBJECT TO LEND IT TO US SAID THE CAPTAIN
I CAN ONLY CONCLUDE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET HERE
IT WAS HARDLY FORTY FEET WIDE
THERE THE ICE-FIELDS ARE AN AGGLOMERATION OF HUMMOCKS AND ICEBERGS MASSED IN WILD CONFUSION OFTEN TOWERING HIGHER THAN THE MASTS OF THE LARGEST WHALERS AND FROM THE INSTABILITY OF THEIR FOUNDATIONS LIABLE TO AN INSTANTANEOUS LOSS OF EQUILIBRIUM
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE PRONOUNCED HIS DECIDED CONVICTION THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE TARTAN TO RESIST THE PRESSURE OF THE ICE IN THE HARBOR OF THE SHELIF AND THAT THERE WOULD BE FAR MORE SAFETY IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE VOLCANO
SPANIARDS SAID SERVADAC
FOR THEMSELVES THE ALL-IMPORTANT PROBLEM WAS--WHAT EFFECT WOULD THE RENDING ASUNDER OF THE COMET HAVE UPON ITS RATE OF PROGRESS
ALL THAT HE HAD NOW TO DO WAS CAREFULLY TO PREVENT ANY SUSPICION OF HIS DISAPPOINTED PROJECT
WE SHALL SEE HOW HE STANDS THE COLD OUT THERE
THE COUNT WAS PRESENT AND THE CONVERSATION PERPETUALLY RECURRED AS NATURALLY IT WOULD TO THE PHENOMENA WHICH REMAINED SO INEXPLICABLE TO THEM ALL
A STEELYARD YES ECHOED THE PROFESSOR IMPATIENTLY
AND PROBABLY REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT AS WE ASCEND WE SHALL FIND NOT ONLY SNOW BUT ICE
HERE ON THE 11TH OF FEBRUARY THERE SUDDENLY AROSE THE CRY OF LAND AND IN THE EXTREME HORIZON RIGHT AHEAD WHERE LAND HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE IT WAS TRUE ENOUGH THAT A SHORE WAS DISTINCTLY TO BE SEEN
IF I SUSPEND A WEIGHT EQUIVALENT TO THE WEIGHT OF A KILOGRAMME THE INDEX WILL REGISTER THE PROPER WEIGHT ON THE SURFACE OF GALLIA
THIS STEADY SINKING OF THE MERCURY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A COMPLETE STILLNESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE
ONE BATTALION HAS FOUGHT--NOW FOR THE REST PERSEVERANCE HAD ITS REWARD
AS ALREADY STATED IN THE MESSAGE BROUGHT BY THE CARRIER PIGEON THE DISTANCE TRAVELED BY GALLIA IN APRIL WAS 39,000,000 LEAGUES AND AT THE END OF THE MONTH SHE WAS 110,000,000 LEAGUES FROM THE SUN
HE SWORE THAT SERVADAC AND HIS PEOPLE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS LOSS
HE WAS CONSEQUENTLY VERY CAUTIOUS IN ALL HIS REPLIES
IN RETURN TO HIS SOMEWHAT HESITATING SALUTATION THE COLONEL GREETED HIM HEARTILY AH
A BARGAIN IS A BARGAIN SAID SERVADAC
JUST SO ASSENTED PROCOPE
THE MESSAGE HAS COME TO US OVER THE SEA NEVER DESPAIR
HOW CHILL IT SEEMED
BEN ZOOF LAUGHED THE MORE AND WAS ON THE POINT OF REPEATING HIS SATIRICAL COMMENTS WHEN A STERN ORDER FROM THE CAPTAIN MADE HIM HOLD HIS TONGUE
HERE THEN WAS A FRESH MYSTERY
BUT ALTHOUGH THE TRANSFORMATION HAD BEEN SO MARVELOUS IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT EITHER COLONEL MURPHY OR MAJOR OLIPHANT HAD MADE MUCH DEMONSTRATION OF ASTONISHMENT
CAPTAIN SERVADAC HAD STRICTLY FORBIDDEN ANY COMMUNICATION WITH HIM
DISTINCTLY HE REMEMBERED THE LONG PROMONTORY WHICH HAD BARRED THE DOBRYNA'S PROGRESS WHILE COASTING THE SOUTHERN CONFINES OF THE SEA AND WHICH HAD OBLIGED HER TO ASCEND NORTHWARDS AS FAR AS THE FORMER LATITUDE OF ORAN
ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS WHILST CAREFULLY GAUGING THE RECESSES OF GEMINI HE ESPIED A BRIGHT SPECK WHICH WAS UNREGISTERED IN THE CHART AND WHICH AT FIRST HE TOOK FOR A SMALL STAR THAT HAD ESCAPED BEING ENTERED IN THE CATALOGUE
JUST BECAUSE THE FELLOW IS A GERMAN WE SHALL NOT BE JUSTIFIED IN TREATING HIM IN GERMAN FASHION
BEN ZOOF AFTER MAKING THE ENCOURAGING REMARK THAT SAVANTS HAVE AS MANY LIVES AS A CAT PROCEEDED WITH NEGRETE'S ASSISTANCE TO GIVE THE BODY SUCH A VIGOROUS RUBBING AS WOULD HAVE THREATENED SERIOUS INJURY TO ANY ORDINARY MORTAL WHILST THEY ADMINISTERED CORDIALS AND RESTORATIVES FROM THE DOBRYNA'S MEDICAL STORES POWERFUL ENOUGH ONE MIGHT THINK TO ROUSE THE VERY DEAD
A SHIP EXCLAIMED SERVADAC STARTING TO HIS FEET
CONFOUND THE BRUTE HE EXCLAIMED I MIGHT AS WELL THROW A PIECE OF BREAD AT HIM
IT IS A SEMAPHORE SIR
HE SUPPLIED HIMSELF WITH WHAT LITTLE FOOD HE REQUIRED FROM HIS OWN STOCK OF PROVISIONS A SMALL SPIRIT-LAMP SUFFICING TO PERFORM ALL THE OPERATIONS OF HIS MEAGER COOKERY
BUT HOW WILL YOU PAY ME PAY YOU
THE TEMPERATURE FELL STEADILY
THE GEOGRAPHICAL MYSTERY HAUNTED THE MINDS OF BOTH THE COUNT AND THE CAPTAIN AND THEY FELT THEY COULD NEVER REST TILL THEY HAD ASCERTAINED WHAT HAD BECOME OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES
THE NECESSARY INFERENCE THAT SEEMED TO FOLLOW FROM THESE PHENOMENA WAS THAT THE EARTH HAD BEEN PROJECTED INTO A NEW ORBIT WHICH HAD THE FORM OF A VERY ELONGATED ELLIPSE
THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL WHOSE SOUL SEEMED UNSTIRRED BY THE APPROACHING EARTH WAS PALMYRIN ROSETTE
BUT THERE IS MORE TO BE DONE
THE NIGHTS CONTINUED LOVELY
BY THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER THE TEMPERATURE HAD SO FAR MODERATED THAT IT COULD SCARCELY BE SAID TO BE INTOLERABLE
FEARFUL LEST THE FAINT GLIMMER SHOULD AT ANY MOMENT CEASE TO BE VISIBLE HECTOR SERVADAC DID NOT QUIT HIS POST UPON THE DECK
THREE DAYS AFTER THE CATASTROPHE CORPORAL PIM ON BEHALF OF HIMSELF AND HIS COMRADES SOLICITED A FORMAL INTERVIEW WITH THE OFFICERS
WHY SHOULD NOT THE MOON HAVE FALLEN WITHIN THE LIMITS OF GALLIA'S ATTRACTION AND BECOME HER SATELLITE UPON THAT SUPPOSITION PUT IN THE COUNT I SHOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD BE ALTOGETHER UNLIKELY THAT THREE MONTHS WOULD ELAPSE WITHOUT OUR SEEING HER QUITE INCREDIBLE CONTINUED PROCOPE
YOU ARE NOT AFRAID TO GO ARE YOU PABLO HE SAID ADDRESSING THE BOY
BUT SERVADAC BIDED HIS TIME
THEN WE MUST BUILD A BOAT AND GO IN SEARCH OF THOSE WHO DO NOT COME IN SEARCH OF US VERY GOOD
ON THE 15TH THE COMET CROSSED THE ORBIT OF MARS AT THE SAFE DISTANCE OF 56,000,000 LEAGUES
NEVER IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE HAD A MERCHANT MET WITH SUCH REVERSES
CAPTAIN SERVADAC HOWEVER WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ANY REPRESENTATION OF PROBABLE DIFFICULTIES
HERE IT IS GENTLEMEN
ANXIOUS TO SHOW ALL PROPER RESPECT TO HIS FORMER TUTOR SERVADAC PROPOSED TO LEAVE THE MOST COMFORTABLE APARTMENT OF THE PLACE AT HIS DISPOSAL
MANY CAUSES HE KNEW BESIDES THE INTERRUPTION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE OXYGEN UPON THE MINERAL SUBSTANCES IN GALLIA'S INTERIOR MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR THE STOPPAGE OF THE LAVA-FLOW IN THIS ONE PARTICULAR SPOT AND HE CONSIDERED IT MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT A FRESH OUTLET HAD BEEN OPENED IN SOME OTHER PART OF THE SURFACE AND THAT THE ERUPTIVE MATTER HAD BEEN DIVERTED INTO THE NEW CHANNEL
THE ISLAND ITSELF THE SOLE SURVIVING FRAGMENT OF AN ENORMOUS PILE OF ROCK THAT HAD REARED ITSELF SOME 1,600 FEET ABOVE THE SEA WAS NOT STRICTLY SPEAKING THE ONLY LAND THAT WAS VISIBLE
HE IS AFRAID SAID BEN ZOOF THAT HE WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR HIS LODGINGS
THE SEA HAS UNDOUBTEDLY SWALLOWED UP ALL THE WESTERN PART OF ALGERIA IT WILL NOT LAST LONG SIR SAID BEN ZOOF
HE ORDERED SEVERAL CASES OF PROVISIONS AND KEGS OF WATER TO BE BROUGHT ON DECK AND SAW THAT THEY WERE SECURELY LASHED TO SOME EMPTY BARRELS TO MAKE THEM FLOAT AFTER THE SHIP HAD GONE DOWN
AN OLD FRENCH PRAYER-BOOK WAS LYING ON THE CORNER OF THE TOMB
WE SHOULD SEE WHAT KIND OF A LIFE THE MISANTHROPE LEADS ON BOARD THE HANSA THE PROPOSAL MET WITH GENERAL APPROBATION
TO MISTAKE ITS IDENTITY WITH THE MOON WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE
IT TOTALLY ECLIPSED AN ENORMOUS PORTION OF THE FIRMAMENT ABOVE AND APPROACHING WITH AN EVER-INCREASING VELOCITY WAS NOW WITHIN HALF ITS AVERAGE DISTANCE FROM THE MOON
TAKE MY ADVICE BEN ZOOF HE SAID
BY A NATURAL IMPULSE SERVADAC'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO OBSERVE THE POSITION OF THE POLE-STAR
BUT CONFOUND IT
HIS FACE IS STRANGELY FAMILIAR TO ME BUT IT WAS NO TIME FOR DELIBERATION
AND WHAT'S MORE HE ADDED MISCHIEVOUSLY YOU WON'T GET THEM ANYWHERE A FROWN CAME OVER THE PROFESSOR'S COUNTENANCE
HOW CLOSELY HE FOLLOWS AND IMPARTS TO HIS READERS THE SCIENTIFIC PROBABILITIES OF THE UNIVERSE BEYOND OUR EARTH THE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE SO HARD WON BY OUR ASTRONOMERS
AFTER A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION HE REPLIED IT MUST I THINK BE ALLOWED THAT YOUR PAY WAS CALCULATED FROM SUNRISE TO SUNRISE
FOR A FEW SECONDS HE STOOD LOST IN THOUGHT THEN SAID SOLEMNLY BEN ZOOF I MUST BE DREAMING
IF OUR ASTEROID HAS CARRIED WITH IT A PORTION OF THE OLD EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE WHY SHOULD IT NOT LIKEWISE RETAIN SOMETHING OF ITS CENTRAL FIRE AH WELL SAID THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS I DARE SAY THERE IS CALORIC ENOUGH IN OUR LITTLE WORLD TO SUPPLY THE WANTS OF ITS POPULATION COUNT TIMASCHEFF INTERRUPTED THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED THIS CONVERSATION BY SAYING AND NOW GENTLEMEN AS OUR COURSE HAS BROUGHT US ON OUR WAY ONCE MORE TOWARDS GIBRALTAR WHAT DO YOU SAY TO OUR RENEWING OUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ENGLISHMEN
HERE THEN AT LAST WAS THE UNRIDDLING OF THE ENIGMA THEY HAD BEEN SO LONG ENDEAVORING TO SOLVE
NEGRETE BEGGED HIM TO TELL THEM ALL AGAIN
I WILL BE EVEN WITH HIM
YES CORFU
I HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT EXCLAIMED SERVADAC
IT MUST BE EIGHT O'CLOCK AT LEAST SAID BEN ZOOF LOOKING AT THE SUN WHICH WAS A CONSIDERABLE HEIGHT ABOVE THE HORIZON
IN ALL HIS TRAVELS AND THESE HAD BEEN NOT A FEW HE HAD NEVER BEHELD SCENERY WHICH COULD COMPETE WITH THAT OF HIS NATIVE HOME
A FINE THING HE SAID TO SPLIT IN TWO LIKE A CHILD'S TOY
NO NO INSISTED SERVADAC
AND IN THREE DAYS AFTER HER ARRIVAL THE DOBRYNA WAS AGAIN READY TO PUT TO SEA
NO THOUGHT HAD BEEN BESTOWED UPON COMFORT OR CONVENIENCE AS THE ASCENT WAS TO LAST FOR SO SHORT A TIME MERELY LONG ENOUGH FOR MAKING THE TRANSIT FROM ATMOSPHERE TO ATMOSPHERE
HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD EVERYTHING TO GAIN UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM OF NIGHTS AND DAYS FOR INSTEAD OF LIVING THE JEW'S ORDINARY LIFE OF A CENTURY HE WOULD REACH TO THE AGE OF TWO CENTURIES
THERE WAS NOT A CLOUD NOR A VAPOR TO CATCH THE TINTS OF THE DECLINING BEAMS
BUT CAPTAIN SERVADAC COULD NOT ALTOGETHER ENTER INTO HIS SERVANT'S ENTHUSIASM
TEN KILOGRAMMES OF TOBACCO AT TWELVE FRANCS A KILOGRAMME
IT WAS PERHAPS ONLY NATURAL THAT THIS CLUSTERED MASS OF BIRDS AS REPRESENTING THE WHOLE OF THE FEATHERED TRIBE UPON THE SURFACE OF GALLIA SHOULD RESORT TO GOURBI ISLAND OF WHICH THE MEADOWS SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY SPOT FROM WHICH THEY COULD GET SUSTENANCE AT ALL
CONSIDERABLY ANSWERED THE LIEUTENANT WHO WENT ON TO DESCRIBE HOW THE DISPLACEMENT OF A POINT AT THE EQUATOR OF JUPITER WAS TWENTY-SEVEN TIMES AS RAPID AS ON THE EARTH CAUSING THE POLAR COMPRESSION TO BE ABOUT 2,378 MILES
THE YACHT MADE ITS WAY TO LAT
THE FIRST WAS OF A DULL WHITE SHADE
BUT THE CUNNING ISRAELITE KNEW THAT THEY WOULD IN ANY CASE BE SECURITY FAR BEYOND THE VALUE OF HIS CASH
BUT THE RIVER-BANK HAD BECOME THE SHORE OF AN UNKNOWN SEA
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY THE SCHOONER ROUNDED THE POINT WHERE FIVE WEEKS PREVIOUSLY CAPE BLANC HAD BEEN SO CONSPICUOUS AN OBJECT AND SHE WAS NOW STEMMING THE WATERS OF WHAT ONCE HAD BEEN THE BAY OF TUNIS
THE CAPTAIN HOWEVER HAD HIS OWN SPECIAL OBJECT IN VIEW AND WOULD NOT BE DIVERTED
CAPTAIN SERVADAC IT MAY WELL BE IMAGINED DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE SAME GRATIFYING EMOTION
OF GOLD IT WAS AS VALUELESS TO THEM AS GRANITE--BUT WITH THE INTENTION OF ASCERTAINING WHETHER THE SUBTERRANEAN FIRE STILL RETAINED ITS ACTIVITY
IT WAS NO TIME FOR CONDOLENCE
AND IN AN INSTANT THE ORDERLY WAS UPON HIS FEET STANDING IN A MILITARY ATTITUDE ONE HAND TO HIS FOREHEAD THE OTHER CLOSELY PRESSED TO HIS TROUSER-SEAM
I SUPPOSE I AM TO FIX MY OWN PRICES YOU WILL OF COURSE CHARGE ORDINARY PRICES--PROPER MARKET PRICES
SIX HOURS LATER ONLY WAITING FOR SUNRISE CAPTAIN SERVADAC SET HIMSELF IN MOVEMENT AGAIN TO RENEW HIS INVESTIGATIONS
THOUGH HEAVEN AND EARTH BE TOPSY-TURVY I MUST BE AT MY POST THIS MORNING TO DO COUNT TIMASCHEFF THE HONOR OF RUNNING HIM THROUGH THE BODY ADDED BEN ZOOF
THE CRUST OF ICE AND SNOW WAS FAR TOO STOUT FOR THE BEAKS OF THE STRONGEST BIRDS TO PENETRATE AND ACCORDINGLY LARGE SWARMS HAD LEFT THE ISLAND AND FOLLOWING THE HUMAN POPULATION HAD TAKEN REFUGE ON THE VOLCANIC PROMONTORY
THE LIEUTENANT WHO HAD SHOUTED FROM THE BOW RUSHED ASTERN AND TOOK THE HELM AND BEFORE ANYONE HAD TIME TO SPECULATE UPON THE OBJECT OF HIS MANEUVERS HE SHOUTED AGAIN LOOK OUT
NOW AND THEN THE CAPTAIN AND HIS FRIENDS FOUND THEMSELVES SPECULATING WHETHER IN THE EVENT OF THEIR HAVING TO SPEND ANOTHER WINTER UPON GALLIA SOME MEANS COULD NOT BE DEVISED BY WHICH THE DREARINESS OF A SECOND RESIDENCE IN THE RECESSES OF THE VOLCANO MIGHT BE ESCAPED
THE ASTRONOMER WAS FRANTIC AT THE LOSS OF HIS MOON
EXTREME VIOLENCE IN PHYSICAL AS WELL AS IN MORAL NATURE IS NEVER OF LONG DURATION
SIXTY
BUT NO ASTRONOMICAL ENTHUSIASM OF THE PROFESSOR COULD QUITE ALLAY THE GENERAL APPREHENSION THAT SOME SERIOUS COLLISION MIGHT BE IMPENDING
IF AS YOU SUPPOSE THE EARTH IS BEING DRAWN ON SO AS TO BE PRECIPITATED AGAINST THE SUN THE GREAT CENTER OF ATTRACTION OF OUR SYSTEM IT COULD ONLY BE BECAUSE THE CENTRIFUGAL AND CENTRIPETAL FORCES THAT CAUSE THE PLANETS TO ROTATE IN THEIR SEVERAL ORBITS HAD BEEN ENTIRELY SUSPENDED
AND I SHALL BE READY TO CO-OPERATE WITH YOU TO THE BEST OF MY POWER IN PUTTING IT INTO EXECUTION ONLY REMEMBER CONTINUED PROCOPE THERE ARE MANY CHANCES TO ONE AGAINST OUR SUCCESS
THE LIEUTENANT HIMSELF TRACED OUT THE PATTERN AND CUT OUT THE STRIPS AND ALL HANDS WERE EMPLOYED IN SEAMING THEM TOGETHER
SHE HAD ENOUGH FOOD SHE SAID AND HAD BEEN WAITING FOR A BOAT TO FETCH HER AND NOW A BOAT HAD COME AND SHE WAS QUITE READY TO GO AWAY
LIGHT VAPORS GATHERED ON THE HORIZON AND CLOUDS WERE FORMED AND CARRIED RAPIDLY ALONG BY BREEZES TO WHICH THE GALLIAN ATMOSPHERE HAD LONG BEEN UNACCUSTOMED
GALLIA CONTINUED ITS COURSE BEARING ITS LITTLE POPULATION ONWARDS SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE ORDINARY INFLUENCE OF HUMAN PASSIONS THAT IT MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID THAT ITS SOLE OSTENSIBLE VICE WAS REPRESENTED BY THE GREED AND AVARICE OF THE MISERABLE JEW
THE SCENE AS HERE DEPICTED TOOK PLACE UPON THE EXTREMITY OF A LITTLE CAPE ON THE ALGERIAN COAST BETWEEN MOSTAGANEM AND TENES ABOUT TWO MILES FROM THE MOUTH OF THE SHELIF
THE TEMPERATURE WAS LOW BEYOND PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE
TAKE YOUR CHOICE
HE HAD A PLAN--HE KNEW HOW
TWO HUNDRED FRANCS WHINED HAKKABUT
NOW CAPTAIN SERVADAC SAID THE PROFESSOR TAKE YOUR PEN AGAIN AND FIND ME THE VOLUME OF GALLIA THE CAPTAIN HESITATED
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WAS EXTREMELY UNEASY
THE ADJACENT BUILDING CONTINUED IN GOOD PRESERVATION AND CAPTAIN SERVADAC'S SATISFACTION WAS VERY GREAT IN FINDING THE TWO HORSES ZEPHYR AND GALETTE COMFORTABLY HOUSED THERE AND IN GOOD CONDITION
DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE GALLIAN YEAR LIEUTENANT PROCOPE HAD TAKEN CAREFUL NOTE OF ROSETTE'S MONTHLY ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE COMET'S PROGRESS AND HE WAS ABLE NOW WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE PROFESSOR TO CALCULATE THE RATE OF ADVANCE ON ITS WAY BACK TOWARDS THE SUN
IT WAS NOT LONG HOWEVER BEFORE HAKKABUT WAS TO BE CALLED UPON TO APPLY HIS MONEY TO A PURPOSE FOR WHICH HE HAD NOT RECKONED
HAPPILY THE RECENT PHENOMENA HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE COMPASS
THAT SINCE THE EARTH ENTERED HER NEW ORBIT HALF THE SIXTY-FOUR DAYS HAS ALREADY ELAPSED AND YET IT IS ONLY JUST RECENTLY THAT SHE HAS CROSSED THE ORBIT OF VENUS HARDLY ONE-THIRD OF THE DISTANCE TO BE TRAVERSED TO REACH THE SUN THE LIEUTENANT PAUSED TO ALLOW TIME FOR REFLECTION AND ADDED
SO READILY DID SERVADAC PROMISE TO DO EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO PROVIDE HIM WITH THE ACCOMMODATION FOR WHICH HE ASKED THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS PUT INTO SUCH A MANIFEST GOOD TEMPER THAT THE CAPTAIN VENTURED TO SPEAK UPON THE MATTER THAT WAS EVER UPPERMOST IN HIS MIND
SURELY NOTHING THOUGHT THE CAPTAIN WILL CONVINCE THE OLD RASCAL NOW
VENUS REVOLVING NOW 66,131,000 MILES AWAY MAY BE ASSIGNED THE AGE OF 50,000,000 YEARS AT LEAST
QUICK QUICK CRIED THE PROFESSOR IMPATIENTLY
I SHOULD THINK SO REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT
HE HAD LISTENED WITH MANIFEST ATTENTION HIS LIPS TWITCHING NOW AND THEN AS IF SUPPRESSING A SMILE
WHO ARE YOU ISAAC HAKKABUT
NO I DON'T MEAN THE BIRDS
THE DIRECTION OF THE AXIS MAJOR OF THE ORBIT WHICH WAS FOUND BY CALCULATING THE LONGITUDE OF THE COMET'S PERIHELION
COUNT TIMASCHEFF WAS NO DOUBT MAGNANIMOUSLY COMING TO THE RESCUE OF HIMSELF AND HIS ORDERLY
I HAVE TOLD YOU YOU SHALL HAVE READY MONEY VERY GOOD YOUR EXCELLENCY
OF JUPITER WE MUST SAY AS WILLIAM TELL SAID ONCE THROUGH THE OMINOUS PASS AND ALL IS WELL THE 15TH OF OCTOBER CAME THE DATE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATION OF THE COMET TO THE PLANET
COME HAKKABUT I SEE THAT YOU ARE NOT DISPOSED EITHER TO LEND OR TO SELL YOUR STEELYARD
HAD HE NOTICED THAT THE DAYS HAD BEEN ONLY SIX HOURS LONG AND THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SO MUCH DIMINISHED
CHAPTER XVII
LISTEN WAS ALL BEN ZOOF'S REPLY
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT CONSTELLATIONS IN THEIR BEAUTY LAY STRETCHED BEFORE HIS EYES--AN ALPHABET WHICH TO HIS MORTIFICATION NOT TO SAY HIS RAGE HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIPHER
AND TURNING TO THE COUNT HE SAID DO YOU HEAR THAT
BUT THE COUNT ENTIRELY REPUDIATED ALL IDEA OF SHRINKING FROM WHAT QUITE AS MUCH AS THE CAPTAIN HE REGARDED AS A SACRED DUTY AND TURNING TO LIEUTENANT PROCOPE TOLD HIM THAT UNLESS SOME BETTER PLAN COULD BE DEVISED HE WAS PREPARED TO START OFF AT ONCE AND MAKE THE ATTEMPT TO SKATE ACROSS TO FORMENTERA
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE COULD NOT SUPPRESS A SMILE
IF GENTLEMEN YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL ENUMERATE THEM
THE EARTH WAS TRAVELING AT THE RATE OF 28,000 LEAGUES AN HOUR AND GALLIA AT THE RATE OF 57,000 LEAGUES AN HOUR THEREFORE THE RESULT WAS THE SAME AS THOUGH A TRAIN RUSHING ALONG AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 86,000 LEAGUES AN HOUR HAD SUDDENLY ENCOUNTERED SOME OBSTACLE
SERVADAC THE COUNT PROCOPE AND BEN ZOOF NOW PROCEEDED TO MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE THICKET UNTIL THEY CAME TO A LITTLE GLADE WHERE TWO MEN WERE STRETCHED IDLY ON THE GRASS ONE OF THEM PLAYING THE GUITAR AND THE OTHER A PAIR OF CASTANETS
LISTENING ATTENTIVELY SERVADAC AND HIS ASSOCIATES COULD DISTINCTLY RECOGNIZE A HUMAN VOICE ACCOMPANIED BY THE NOTES OF A GUITAR AND BY THE MEASURED CLICK OF CASTANETS
THEY KNEW TOO THAT THE CALIBER OR DIAMETER OF EACH PIECE OF MONEY IS RIGOROUSLY DETERMINED BY LAW AND THAT THE DIAMETERS OF THE SILVER COINS REPRESENTING FIVE FRANCS TWO FRANCS AND FIFTY CENTIMES MEASURE THIRTY-SEVEN TWENTY-SEVEN AND EIGHTEEN MILLIMETERS RESPECTIVELY
IT WAS QUITE DISTINCT
BUT WHAT SORT OF A SAILOR ARE YOU EVERYONE CAN BE A SAILOR WHEN HE MUST SAID SERVADAC CALMLY
WILL YOU THEREFORE HAVE THE GOODNESS TO PROVIDE ME AT ONCE WITH A STEELYARD AND A TESTED KILOGRAMME THE AUDIENCE LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND THEN AT BEN ZOOF WHO WAS THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THEIR RESOURCES
BEN ZOOF GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF WHEN THE CAPTAIN COMMUNICATED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE
YOU CAN AFFORD TO BUY WHAT YOU WANT
BUT THE PERIL SEEMED ONLY TO INCREASE
W
THUS THE DOBRYNA REGAINED THE WATERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN WITHOUT DISCOVERING A TRACE OF THE MISSING PROVINCE OF ALGERIA
BESIDE A QUANTITY OF GAME--QUAILS PARTRIDGES AND WOODCOCKS
WHY NOT REPEATED BEN ZOOF UNWILLING TO RENOUNCE HIS FIRST IMPRESSION
THE SAP ROSE RAPIDLY IN THE TREES SO THAT IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS BUDS LEAVES FLOWERS AND FRUIT HAD COME TO FULL MATURITY
THE PROBLEM IS INDEPENDENT OF IT THEN WE AWAIT YOUR ORDERS WAS THE CAPTAIN'S REPLY
THE WEATHER IS BEAUTIFULLY CALM AND THE STEAM-LAUNCH WILL ANSWER OUR PURPOSE BETTER
WHO COULD EXPECT TO FIND COAL IN THE BOWELS OF GALLIA,--COAL WHICH IS THE RESIDUUM OF ANCIENT FORESTS MINERALIZED BY THE LAPSE OF AGES
ITS CAUSE ITS LIMITS WE HAVE UTTERLY FAILED TO DISCOVER BUT FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE ISLAND ON WHICH WE FIND YOU HERE YOU HAVE EVIDENTLY EXPERIENCED ITS DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES THE ENGLISHMEN IN SILENCE BOWED ASSENT
BUT THE POPULATION OF GALLIA HAD NO ANXIETY IN THE MATTER OF PROVISIONS--THEIR STOCK WAS FAR MORE THAN ADEQUATE
AS THESE THOUGHTS WERE CROSSING HIS MIND A HARSH BARK WAS HEARD TO THE LEFT OF THE FOOTPATH AND A JACKAL WAS SEEN EMERGING FROM A LARGE GROVE OF LENTISKS
IT IS BY THEIR MOVEMENTS THAT THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT HAS BEEN CALCULATED
IF REALLY HIS CALCULATIONS AND HIS OBSERVATIONS WERE AT VARIANCE THIS IN A MAN OF HIS IRRITABLE TEMPERAMENT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR HIS PERPETUAL PERTURBATION
DO YOU NOT SEE THE ENGLISH FLAG AND AS HE SPOKE HE POINTED WITH NATIONAL PRIDE TO THE BRITISH STANDARD FLOATING OVER THE TOP OF THE ISLAND
IN SHEER DESPERATION HE ENDEAVORED TO INCREASE THE INTENSITY OF HIS VISION BY APPLYING TO HIS EYES SOME BELLADONNA WHICH HE FOUND IN THE DOBRYNA'S MEDICINE CHEST
SERVADAC SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN CONTEMPT AND TURNED AWAY
SECONDLY THAT AS THE RESULT OF BEING BROUGHT UNDER THAT ATTRACTION IT MIGHT BE TRANSFORMED INTO A SATELLITE OR EVEN A SUB-SATELLITE OF THAT MIGHTY WORLD
AT ANY RATE HE HOPED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING THE CONSTELLATIONS IN A CLEAR FIRMAMENT ABOVE
A LIGHT ON THE HORIZON ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WITHOUT GIVING HIMSELF ANY FURTHER CONCERN ABOUT THE JEW'S INCREDULITY THE CAPTAIN GAVE ORDERS FOR THE HANSA TO BE SHIFTED ROUND TO THE HARBOR OF THE SHELIF
CAPTAIN SERVADAC WITH CLENCHED TEETH AND KNITTED BROW STOOD STERNLY ALMOST FIERCELY REGARDING THE BOUNDLESS WASTE OF WATER
IT MUST BE PECULIAR TO THE COAST OF ALGERIA SERVADAC WAS STUPEFIED
THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE
FAR INTO SPACE A MONTH PASSED AWAY
CAPTAIN SERVADAC CONSOLED HIMSELF WITH THE PROSPECT OF READING AN EXPLANATION OF THE MYSTERY IN NEXT WEEK'S NEWSPAPERS AND TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS TO HIM OF MORE IMMEDIATE IMPORTANCE
IN THE MORE INTERIOR GALLERIES THERE WAS STILL A CERTAIN DEGREE OF WARMTH AND HITHER SERVADAC AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO RETREAT
HAPPIEST OF ALL WERE PABLO AND NINA
THE PROFESSOR COMMENCED
IT WAS SCARCELY LIKELY THAT THE COMET COULD SUPPLY THE FUEL OF WHICH ERE LONG THEY WOULD BE IN URGENT NEED
AT LEAST I KNOW I WAS THERE WHEN THAT DREADFUL SHOCK CAME AND ALTERED EVERYTHING THE COUNT KNEW THAT MADALENA WAS CLOSE TO CAPRERA TO THE NORTH OF SARDINIA WHICH HAD ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED IN THE DISASTER
SOMETHING VERY STRANGE HAS HAPPENED
WE HAVE AGREED YOU KNOW THAT COME WHAT MAY WE ARE TO BE PHILOSOPHERS AY TRUE MY FRIEND REJOINED THE COUNT
THERE WAS NO SPECIFICATION OF WHAT THE INTERVAL SHOULD BE
LAMPS WERE SUSPENDED OVER THE DIFFERENT TABLES
COFFEE IS NUTRITIOUS
SEVEN YEARS IN ALGERIA
GRADUALLY THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO PLANETS BEGAN TO INCREASE
THE SPANIARDS EVIDENTLY HAD NO CONCEPTION OF HIS MEANING
DO THEY EXPECT TO GO BACK TO SPAIN TILL THEY HAVE PAID THEIR DEBTS
FROM ITS INCREASED REMOTENESS THE DIAMETER OF THE SUN'S DISC WAS DIMINISHED TO 5 DEGREES 46 MINS
I BELIEVE OLD HAKKABUT HAS A STEELYARD ON BOARD HIS TARTAN SAID BEN ZOOF PRESENTLY
YES OUT OF PLACE ENTIRELY WHAT CRIED SERVADAC AND PROCOPE IN A BREATH OUT OF PLACE YES COMPLETELY SAID THE PROFESSOR
IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT HE IS NOT ALONE IN HIS DISTRESS LIEUTENANT PROCOPE EXPRESSED MUCH SURPRISE
YOU ARE SERVADAC REPLIED ROSETTE
BUT THESE LAST FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS
ONLY THAT HOUND OF A HAKKABUT SAYS HE WANTS TO SPEAK TO YOU LET HIM IN THEN BEN ZOOF HESITATED
NOW I DO NOT ENTERTAIN A DOUBT BUT THAT THE WARMTH WE REQUIRE IS RESIDENT IN THE BOWELS OF THIS MOUNTAIN ON WHICH WE ARE LIVING
PERHAPS I CAN CONVINCE YOU THAT MY IDEA IS NOT SO CHIMERICAL AS YOU IMAGINE AND KNITTING HIS BROW HE PROCEEDED TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF HIS PLAN
SERVADAC THOUGHT IT MIGHT PROBABLY BE OF SERVICE IN CARRYING SOME COMMUNICATION TO THE EARTH
WE ARE ENCAMPED UPON AN ISLAND AND THEREFORE WE CAN ONLY BE RESCUED BY SEA BUT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT ANY OF OUR FRIENDS ARE STILL ALIVE ASKED BEN ZOOF
CAPTAIN SERVADAC BECAME AWARE THAT THE HUGE DISC THAT HAD BEEN LOOMING THROUGH THE CLOUDS AFTER THE SHOCK WAS THE FORM OF THE RETREATING EARTH TO THE PROXIMITY OF WHICH THE ONE HIGH TIDE THEY HAD EXPERIENCED WAS ALSO TO BE ATTRIBUTED
THE COWARDS WOULD BE TOO HEAVY TO RUN AWAY BEN ZOOF VENTURED THE REMARK THAT AS THE SMALLNESS OF GALLIA SECURED TO ITS INHABITANTS SUCH AN INCREASE OF STRENGTH AND AGILITY HE WAS ALMOST SORRY THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN A LITTLE SMALLER STILL
GALLIA COULD SCARCELY BE OTHERWISE THAN AN OBJECT OF TERROR TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH WHO COULD BY NO MEANS BE CERTAIN THAT A SECOND COLLISION WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY SO HARMLESS AS THE FIRST
ALTHOUGH IT WAS APPARENTLY MUCH NEARER TO GALLIA THAN THE MOON TO THE EARTH ITS SUPERFICIES WAS HARDLY ONE-TENTH AS LARGE AND SO FEEBLY DID IT REFLECT THE LIGHT OF THE REMOTE SUN THAT IT SCARCELY EMITTED RADIANCE ENOUGH TO EXTINGUISH THE DIM LUSTER OF STARS OF THE EIGHTH MAGNITUDE
WERE THE ASTRONOMER'S CALCULATIONS CORRECT AND WAS THERE A SOUND FOUNDATION FOR HIS PREDICTION THAT THE COMET WOULD AGAIN TOUCH THE EARTH
BUT WHAT IF THERE WERE ANY ERRORS IN HIS CALCULATIONS
BUT HIS ADVICE WAS RECEIVED WITH SO ANGRY A REBUFF THAT HE RETIRED IN ALL HASTE ABASHED TO RESUME HIS WATCHMAN'S DUTY WHICH HE PERFORMED WITH EXEMPLARY PERSEVERANCE
ON THE 9TH OF FEBRUARY THE DOBRYNA PASSED OVER THE SITE OF THE CITY OF DIDO THE ANCIENT BYRSA--A CARTHAGE HOWEVER WHICH WAS NOW MORE COMPLETELY DESTROYED THAN EVER PUNIC CARTHAGE HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY SCIPIO AFRICANUS OR ROMAN CARTHAGE BY HASSAN THE SARACEN
HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISAPPOINTED THAT HIS RETURN TO MOSTAGANEM WAS NOT WELCOMED WITH A TRIUMPHAL RECEPTION
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FIRST TELL ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED THE VERY QUESTION I WAS ABOUT TO PUT TO YOU CAPTAIN SERVADAC DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE CAUSE AND CAN TELL ME NOTHING OF THE EXTENT OF THE CATASTROPHE WHICH HAS TRANSFORMED THIS PART OF AFRICA INTO AN ISLAND NOTHING MORE THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF BUT SURELY COUNT TIMASCHEFF YOU CAN INFORM ME WHETHER UPON THE NORTHERN SHORE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEDITERRANEAN ASKED THE COUNT SIGNIFICANTLY AND ADDED I HAVE DISCOVERED NO SIGN OF LAND THE CAPTAIN STARED IN SILENT BEWILDERMENT
THEY MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE ENCLOSURE AND FINDING AN OPEN DOOR THEY PASSED THROUGH AND SOON CAME TO A SECOND DOOR ALSO OPEN WHICH ADMITTED THEM TO THE INTERIOR OF THE MOSQUE CONSISTING OF A SINGLE CHAMBER THE WALLS OF WHICH WERE ORNAMENTED IN THE ARABIAN STYLE BY SCULPTURES OF INDIFFERENT EXECUTION
TRUE TO HIS WORD THE CAPTAIN NEXT MORNING ARRIVED AT THE TARTAN
GOOD-MORNING OLD ELEAZAR
THE WHOLE PARTY THROVE REMARKABLY WELL UPON THE LIBERAL PROVISIONS OF THE COMMISSARIAT DEPARTMENT AND IF THE OFFICERS FAILED TO SHOW THE SAME TENDENCY TO EMBONPOINT WHICH WAS FAST BECOMING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MEN IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE THEY DEEMED IT DUE TO THEIR RANK TO CURTAIL ANY INDULGENCES WHICH MIGHT COMPROMISE THE FIT OF THEIR UNIFORM
IT IS TWELVE YEARS OR MORE SINCE I SAW YOU
FOR IF UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF JUPITER'S ATTRACTION THE COMET HAD BEEN RETARDED FOR A SINGLE HOUR IN THAT HOUR THE EARTH WOULD HAVE ALREADY TRAVELED 2,300,000 MILES FROM THE POINT WHERE CONTACT WOULD ENSUE AND MANY CENTURIES WOULD ELAPSE BEFORE SUCH A COINCIDENCE WOULD POSSIBLY AGAIN OCCUR
HE WAS AT A LOSS WHAT TO SAY
OUT OF THE QUESTION
HE TOOK THE CUE AND PROMPTLY ORDERED THE JEW TO HOLD HIS TONGUE AT ONCE
A STRONG DESIRE WAS EXPRESSED BY LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THAT HE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ACCOMPANY CAPTAIN SERVADAC INSTEAD OF COUNT TIMASCHEFF
THE OWNER WAS SPARING OF HIS FUEL AND IT WAS ONLY THE NON-CONDUCTING LAYER OF ICE ENVELOPING THE TARTAN THAT RENDERED THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE ENDURABLE
TO SERVADAC AND HIS FRIENDS THIS CONTINUAL DISQUIETUDE AND ILL-HUMOR ON THE PART OF THE PROFESSOR OCCASIONED NO LITTLE ANXIETY
THE ORDERLY HAD BEEN TAUNTING THE ASTRONOMER WITH THE MUTILATION OF HIS LITTLE COMET
ANOTHER ON THE RIGHT WAS APPROPRIATED TO THE LIEUTENANT AND BEN ZOOF
IT WOULD BE THE HEIGHT OF FOLLY TO LEAVE HER IN HER PRESENT MOORINGS
IT IS TIME TO START TIME TO START EXCLAIMED BEN ZOOF RUBBING HIS EYES
THIRSTING FOR GLORY RATHER THAN FOR GOLD SLIGHTLY SCATTER-BRAINED BUT WARM-HEARTED GENEROUS AND BRAVE HE WAS EMINENTLY FORMED TO BE THE PROTEGE OF THE GOD OF BATTLES
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE 62D OF APRIL WITHOUT NOTICING THE GENERAL SMILE WHICH THE NOVEL DATE PROVOKED THE ASTRONOMER LEFT THE HALL AND RETIRED TO HIS OBSERVATORY
THE SAD SCENE WAS NOT PERMITTED TO BE LONG
GRADUALLY BUT UNINTERRUPTEDLY LIFE AND SPIRITS CONTINUED TO REVIVE AND BY THE END OF THE MONTH SERVADAC AND HIS LITTLE COLONY HAD REGAINED MOST OF THEIR ORDINARY PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ENERGIES
AND IN THEIR SOLID CASEMATE WITH ITS SUBSTANTIAL WALLS THEY WOULD FIND AMPLE SHELTER FROM THE RIGOR OF THE COLD
PRODUCED BY JUDY BOSS OFF ON A COMET OR HECTOR SERVADAC WORKS OF JULES VERNE EDITED BY CHARLES F
THEN IN A VOICE FULL OF SATISFACTION AND THAT INVOLUNTARILY RECALLED THE EXCLAMATIONS OF DELIGHT THAT HAD WOUND UP THE TWO FIRST OF THE MYSTERIOUS DOCUMENTS THAT HAD BEEN RECEIVED HE BURST OUT WELL GENTLEMEN WHAT DO YOU THINK OF GALLIA THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ANYONE TO MAKE A REPLY BEFORE ISAAC HAKKABUT HAD DARTED FORWARD
ANOTHER OF THE VOYAGES TO THE ISLAND HAD BEEN TO COLLECT THE DRY GRASS AND STRAW WHICH WAS NECESSARY FOR INFLATING THE BALLOON
PAY ME WHAT YOU OWE ME YOU MISERABLE MAJOS MEANWHILE THE SONG CONTINUED
AND LIEUTENANT PROCOPE RENEWED HIS ASSURANCES THAT HE ENTERTAINED GOOD HOPES THAT EVERY PERPLEXITY WOULD SOON BE SOLVED
YES SAID THE COUNT
T THE INITIALS OF COUNT TIMASCHEFF
ONE KILOGRAMME FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY GRAMMES
AFTER A THAW SHOULD SET IN NEITHER THE YACHT NOR THE TARTAN COULD BE RECKONED ON FOR SERVICE AND IT WOULD BE INEXPEDIENT TO MAKE USE OF THE STEAM LAUNCH FOR WHICH ONLY A FEW TONS OF COAL HAD BEEN RESERVED JUST SUFFICIENT TO CONVEY THEM TO GOURBI ISLAND WHEN THE OCCASION SHOULD ARISE
CERTAIN IT IS THAT ONE MORNING WHEN THE WEATHER WAS BRIGHT AND CALM THEY HAD EMBARKED ALONE IN THE LITTLE BOAT AND BEEN ABSENT FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS
THE VICTUALING OF THE LITTLE COLONY OFFERED NO IMMEDIATE DIFFICULTY
SERVADAC WAS WILD WITH VEXATION
THESE WERE THE VAPORS THAT PERVADED THE TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERE
HE EXPECTED INDEED THAT ISAAC HAKKABUT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE BUT CONSIDERED THERE COULD BE NO HARM IN APPROPRIATING THE GOODS FOR THE COMMON WELFARE SINCE THERE COULD BE NO OPPORTUNITY NOW FOR SELLING THEM
THERE WAS HALF A MINUTE YET
GREAT GAPS FURROWED THE FIELDS AND TREES HALF UPROOTED OVERHUNG THE WATER REMARKABLE BY THE FANTASTIC DISTORTIONS OF THEIR GNARLED TRUNKS LOOKING AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN CHOPPED BY A HATCHET
INTO THIS COVE THE DOBRYNA WAS DULY SIGNALED AND AS SOON AS SHE WAS SAFELY MOORED SHE LOWERED HER FOUR-OAR AND COUNT TIMASCHEFF AND CAPTAIN SERVADAC MADE THEIR WAY AT ONCE TO LAND
THE MERCURY HOWEVER NEVER EXHIBITED ANY OF THOSE FLUCTUATIONS THAT ARE EVER AND AGAIN TO BE OBSERVED IN VARIABLE CLIMATES BUT CONTINUED SLOWLY AND STEADILY TO FALL AND IN ALL PROBABILITY WOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL IT REACHED THE NORMAL TEMPERATURE OF THE REGIONS OF OUTLYING SPACE
VENUS IN PERILOUS PROXIMITY THE LIGHT OF THE RETURNING SUN SOON EXTINGUISHED THE GLORY OF THE STARS AND RENDERED IT NECESSARY FOR THE CAPTAIN TO POSTPONE HIS OBSERVATIONS
WHAT THEREFORE IS OUR CONCLUSION
I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR ROSETTE COULDN'T MAKE HIS COMET GO STRAIGHT BACK COULD HE HUSH CRIED SERVADAC
TO THE SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM SERVADAC APPLIED HIMSELF WITH THE MOST THOUGHTFUL DILIGENCE
AN HOUR HENCE WILL DO BUT IN SPITE OF THIS CONDESCENSION ON THE PART OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE SOME HOURS HAD TO ELAPSE BEFORE ANY PLACE OF RETREAT COULD BE DISCOVERED LIKELY TO SUIT HIS REQUIREMENTS
AND AS SUCH I WILL INSERT IT UPON MY NEW CHART OUR FRIEND SAID SERVADAC SEEMS TO BE MORE AND MORE GRATIFIED WITH THE CONDITION OF THINGS
APPARENTLY RISING WITH THEM IN THEIR ASCENT THE HORIZON WAS WELL-DEFINED
THE SAD PRESENTIMENT FORCED ITSELF UPON THEIR MINDS THAT IT WAS A MERE CAIRN TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN HURRYING
THROWN ME OUT BUT HE DID NOT VOUCHSAFE ANY REPLY TO SERVADAC'S INQUIRIES AND WITHDREW TO HIS STUDY
SERVADAC AND THE COUNT WERE AT ONCE APPRISED OF THE FACT AND HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNIZING THE SUBSTANCE THAT HAD REVEALED ITSELF AS THE VERY SAME WHICH COMPOSED THE SHORES AS WELL AS THE SUBSOIL OF THE GALLIAN SEA
ROSETTE IN HIS ABSORBING INTEREST FOR THE GLOWING GLORIES OF THE PLANET SEEMED TO BE BEGUILED INTO COMPARATIVE FORGETFULNESS OF THE CHARMS OF HIS COMET
IF SO IT MUST BE IN FLAMES
IN FACT MAJOR OLIPHANT HE SAID IN CONCLUSION I AM HERE TO INQUIRE WHETHER YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS WOULD BE DISPOSED TO JOIN US IN OUR PRESENT QUARTERS I AM OBLIGED TO YOU CAPTAIN SERVADAC ANSWERED THE MAJOR STIFFLY
WAS SHE NOW RETURNING
BOTH MEN WERE SOON ON THEIR FEET AND BEGAN TO MAKE A VIGOROUS CLEARANCE OF THE RUINS BENEATH WHICH THEY FOUND THAT THEIR ARMS COOKING UTENSILS AND OTHER PROPERTY HAD SUSTAINED LITTLE INJURY
FORTHWITH ON THE 20TH OF DECEMBER THE REMOVAL OF THE GOODS COMMENCED
THE JEW WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK AGAIN WHEN CAPTAIN SERVADAC INTERPOSED
HARDLY A MINUTE ELAPSED BEFORE THE JEW WAS BACK AGAIN CARRYING HIS PRECIOUS STEELYARD WITH OSTENTATIOUS CARE
I HAVE NOTHING TO GIVE YOU HE MOANED PITEOUSLY
BOTH THE TRAVELERS PROCOPE FROM A SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW SERVADAC FROM AN AESTHETIC WERE ALIKE IMPRESSED BY THE SOLEMNITY OF THE SCENE AND WHERE THE LENGTHENED SHADOW OF THE SAIL CAST UPON THE ICE BY THE OBLIQUE RAYS OF THE SETTING SUN HAD DISAPPEARED AND DAY HAD GIVEN PLACE TO NIGHT THE TWO MEN DRAWN TOGETHER AS BY AN INVOLUNTARY IMPULSE MUTUALLY HELD EACH OTHER'S HANDS IN SILENCE
AS SOON THEN AS HE FOUND THE TARTAN EMPTY HE WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO ACCEPT THE OFFER THAT HAD BEEN MADE HIM AND VERY SOON MADE HIS WAY OVER TO THE QUARTERS IN THE GALLERY WHERE HIS MERCHANDISE HAD BEEN STORED
AS SOON AS THE ANCHOR IMBEDDED IN THE SANDY BOTTOM HAD MADE GOOD ITS HOLD A BOAT WAS LOWERED
HE MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT FINDING A WAY OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTY AND HASTILY MOUNTED THE CABIN-LADDER
GALLIA
GALLIA
THEY WERE PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY WHAT SEEMED TO THEM ALMOST THE MYSTERIOUS CALMNESS WITH WHICH THE ERUPTION WAS EFFECTED
THE EDGES OF THE SKATES HAD CUT OUT A LABYRINTH OF CURVES COMPLICATED AS THE FIGURES TRACED BY AQUATIC INSECTS UPON THE SURFACE OF A POOL
ON THE 12TH BEN ZOOF WHO WAS HANGING ABOUT OUTSIDE THE GREAT HALL OF THE CAVERN HEARD THE PROFESSOR INSIDE UTTER A LOUD CRY
I MUST TALK TO THOSE WHO CAN UNDERSTAND THE PROFESSOR TOOK THE CUBE AND ON ATTACHING IT TO THE HOOK OF THE STEELYARD FOUND THAT ITS APPARENT WEIGHT WAS ONE KILOGRAMME AND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY GRAMMES
BUT IF THE PROFESSOR'S CALCULATIONS WERE CORRECT--AND WHY SHOULD THEY BE DOUBTED?--THEIR LITTLE VESSEL WAS DESTINED AFTER A TWO YEARS ABSENCE ONCE MORE TO RETURN TO PORT THE LANDING INDEED MIGHT BE A MATTER OF DIFFICULTY
BOTH OF THEM WERE PHLEGMATIC IN TEMPERAMENT AND BOTH MUCH ADDICTED TO THE WEARING OF THEIR UNIFORMS
WE WILL TRANSACT OUR BUSINESS IN A BUSINESS WAY
FOR ABOUT TWELVE MILES TO THE SOUTH THERE WAS ANOTHER ISLAND APPARENTLY THE VERY COUNTERPART OF WHAT WAS NOW OCCUPIED BY THE ENGLISHMEN
LITTLE USEFUL TRACTS OF EARTH ARE PICKED UP AND AS IT WERE TURNED OVER AND CLAPPED DOWN RIGHT SIDE UP AGAIN UPON THE COMET'S SURFACE
THE WILY JEW WAS TAKEN SOMEWHAT BY SURPRISE BUT CAME TO AN IMMEDIATE CONCLUSION THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS CONTEMPLATING BORROWING SOME MONEY
THE SEA APPEARED QUITE DESERTED A MOST UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALONG THIS COAST AND NOT A SAIL NOR A TRAIL OF SMOKE BROKE THE GRAY MONOTONY OF WATER AND SKY
MOST LIKELY YOU ARE RIGHT REPLIED THE COUNT
EXCEPT A CHANGE OF WIND OR AS PROCOPE OBSERVED A SUPERNATURAL RIFTING OF THE ROCK NOTHING COULD BRING DELIVERANCE NOW
BUT WHO CAN SAY WHAT THAT LIMIT WILL BE
YET IN THE SAME TIME HER DISTANCE FROM THE SUN HAD NEVERTHELESS BEEN INCREASED BY THIRTY-TWO MILLIONS OF LEAGUES
THEY SHALL CERTAINLY BE TOLD THAT WE ARE BEING CARRIED AWAY INTO UNKNOWN REGIONS OF SPACE AND THAT THIS ISLAND IS NEARLY ALL THAT REMAINS OF THE OLD WORLD HA
THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THE SIDE-WORK OF THE TRENCH HAD BEEN SO RIDDLED BY SHELL THAT A PORTION OF IT HAD ACTUALLY FALLEN IN LEAVING AN APERTURE QUITE UNSHELTERED FROM THE GRAPE-SHOT THAT WAS POURING IN THICK AND FAST
PERHAPS AFTER ALL THE COMET HAS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CONVULSION THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED NONSENSE EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN
PRESENTLY HE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND TO HIS FOREHEAD AS THOUGH INSTINCTIVELY FEELING FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS MISSING
HAVING ASCERTAINED AS THEY IMAGINED THAT THE SPOT WAS DEVOID OF LIVING CREATURE THEY WERE ON THE POINT OF RETURNING TO THEIR BOAT WHEN THEIR ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY A FAINT BLEATING AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS A SOLITARY SHE-GOAT CAME BOUNDING TOWARDS THE SHORE
IN A FEW MINUTES MORE COUNT TIMASCHEFF HAD LANDED ON THE ISLAND
LOST IN BEWILDERING MAZE OF THOUGHT HE GAZED LONG AND INTENTLY UPON THE HEAVENS
NO ONE SIR
YOU ARE AT HOME HERE SAID SERVADAC WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS AS HE COULD COMMAND
WHAT'S ALL THIS HAKKABUT HE ASKED
NOR WAS THERE ANYTHING TO GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE LOCALITY IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO THE WAVES
IT WAS UNADVISABLE FOR ALL THREE OF THEM TO GO AS IN CASE OF THERE BEING SEVERAL PERSONS TO BE RESCUED THE SPACE AT THEIR COMMAND WOULD BE QUITE INADEQUATE
OCCASIONALLY THE SKATERS WERE OBLIGED TO STOP TO RECOVER THEIR BREATH BUT FEARFUL OF FROST-BITE THEY ALMOST INSTANTLY RESUMED THEIR EXERCISE AND PROCEEDED NEARLY AS FAR AS GOURBI ISLAND BEFORE THEY THOUGHT ABOUT RETRACING THEIR COURSE
SOMETIMES I SUPPOSE JUPITER HAS THE BENEFIT OF FOUR MOONS ALL SHINING AT ONCE ASKED SERVADAC
BEN ZOOF EJACULATED SERVADAC WHO COULD SCARCELY SHOUT LOUD ENOUGH TO RELIEVE HIS PENT-UP FEELINGS
WHILST THE REST WERE ENJOYING THEIR RECREATION SERVADAC AND THE COUNT WOULD HOLD LONG CONVERSATIONS WITH LIEUTENANT PROCOPE ABOUT THEIR PRESENT POSITION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS DISCUSSING ALL MANNER OF SPECULATIONS AS TO THE RESULTS OF THE ANTICIPATED COLLISION WITH THE EARTH AND WONDERING WHETHER ANY MEASURES COULD BE DEVISED FOR MITIGATING THE VIOLENCE OF A SHOCK WHICH MIGHT BE TERRIBLE IN ITS CONSEQUENCES EVEN IF IT DID NOT ENTAIL A TOTAL ANNIHILATION OF THEMSELVES
HIS STEELYARD IS WRONG
THE TORRENT OF LAVA FELL INTO A SMALL ROCK-BOUND BASIN THAT HAD NO APPARENT COMMUNICATION WITH THE SEA AND WAS EVIDENTLY THE APERTURE OF A DEEP ABYSS OF WHICH THE WATERS HEATED BY THE DESCENT OF THE ERUPTIVE MATTER WOULD NO DOUBT RETAIN THEIR LIQUID CONDITION LONG AFTER THE GALLIAN SEA HAD BECOME A SHEET OF ICE
HALF AN HOUR LATER BOTH NINA AND MARZY WERE SAFELY QUARTERED ON BOARD THE YACHT
FORMENTERA CHAPTER XXIV
THE FIRST OBJECT THAT CAUGHT THEIR ATTENTION AS THEY EMERGED UPON THE OPEN ROCKS WAS THE UNFORTUNATE PROFESSOR WHO WAS SCRAMBLING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE PITEOUSLY DISPLAYING A FRAGMENT OF HIS SHATTERED TELESCOPE
HIS REASON FOR COMING TO THIS CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE CALORIC EMITTED BY THE RISING VAPORS OF THE HOT LAVA SEEMED TO BE OOZING AS IT WERE OUT OF THE TELLURIUM WHICH HAD BEEN DEMONSTRATED ALREADY TO BE A CONDUCTOR OF HEAT
LIKE TENES OF WHICH NOT SO MUCH AS A RUINED COTTAGE WAS VISIBLE ON THE HORIZON IT SEEMED TO BE ANNIHILATED
SPAIN WITH PORTUGAL AS A PENNANT LIKE AN UNFURLED BANNER FLOATED FROM THE EXTREMITY OF THE CONTINENT
WHAT HAS MASS TO DO WITH THE ORBIT
THE SHELIF WAS NOT MORE THAN A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE MEADOW BUT NO TIME WAS TO BE LOST IF THE TWO MEN WERE TO REACH THE TOWN BEFORE NIGHTFALL
AGAINST HIS BETTER JUDGMENT HE WAS STILL BENT UPON THE EXPEDITION AND BEN ZOOF DECLARED HIMSELF READY TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER IN THE EVENT OF COUNT TIMASCHEFF HESITATING TO ENCOUNTER THE PERIL WHICH THE UNDERTAKING INVOLVED
STILL HAKKABUT HESITATED TO MAKE THE FIRST ADVANCE AND IT WAS ACCORDINGLY WITH MUCH SATISFACTION THAT HE HAILED CAPTAIN SERVADAC'S APPEARANCE ON BOARD THE HANSA
THE TOWN OF BIZERTA ONCE CHARMING IN ITS ORIENTAL BEAUTY HAD VANISHED UTTERLY
THE ENGLISHMEN STARTED SIMULTANEOUSLY TO THEIR FEET
THE COAST WITHOUT DEVIATION STILL TENDED TOWARDS THE NORTH
HE IS BEGINNING HIS CHAPTER OF LAMENTATIONS OVER AGAIN
THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY BY NO MEANS SHARED IN THEIR UNEASINESS
IT AMPLY JUSTIFIED THE EPITHET OF SPARKLING WHICH THE ANCIENTS WERE ACCUSTOMED TO CONFER UPON IT AND COULD SCARCELY FAIL TO AWAKEN A NEW INTEREST
I SHALL PAY FOR THEM AH YES YOUR EXCELLENCY WHISPERED THE JEW HIS VOICE TREMBLING LIKE A STREET BEGGAR
NO OTHER HABITATION WAS TO BE SEEN
NUMBERS OF LITTLE RIVULETS INTERSECTED THE PASTURE-LAND
ARE YOUR FRIENDS THE BIRDS AT THEIR PRANKS AGAIN ASKED THE CAPTAIN
THE CAVERN HOWEVER WAS QUITE CAPABLE OF BEING LIGHTED BY MEANS OF LAMPS AND LANTERNS
THEY HAD BUT ONE SMALL BOAT
WHAT IS IT WORTH
PROBABLY COUNT TIMASCHEFF CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WERE THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO COULD BRING ANY SCIENTIFIC JUDGMENT TO BEAR UPON THE UNCERTAINTY THAT WAS BEFORE THEM BUT A GENERAL SENSE OF THE STRANGENESS OF THEIR SITUATION COULD NOT FAIL AT TIMES TO WEIGH HEAVILY UPON THE MINDS OF ALL
AND HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU THAT THIS PHILOSOPHER IN PARTICULAR IS ONE OF THE MOST ECCENTRIC BEINGS IN CREATION BESIDES ADDED THE LIEUTENANT IT IS EXCEEDINGLY LIKELY THAT HIS OBSERVATIONS HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE PERIOD BEFORE THE CONVULSION HAPPENED THUS THE GENERAL CONCLUSION ARRIVED AT BY THE GALLIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCE WAS THIS
DURING THE YEAR AT THE LYCEE YOUNG SERVADAC NEVER OF A VERY STUDIOUS TURN OF MIND HAD CONTRIVED AS THE RINGLEADER OF A SET OF LIKE CALIBER AS HIMSELF TO LEAD THE POOR PROFESSOR A LIFE OF PERPETUAL TORMENT
THE DOOR WAS UNFASTENED AND ISAAC HAKKABUT ENVELOPED IN AN OLD OVERCOAT SHUFFLED INTO THE GALLERY
WHY IT IS RISING FINELY LIKE A CONSCRIPT AT THE SOUND OF THE REVEILLE
HE WILL COME ROUND YET
WELL MUFFLED UP AS THEY WERE IN FURS THEY WERE ABLE TO ENDURE THE COLD WITH IMPUNITY MAKING IT THEIR SPECIAL CARE TO AVOID ACTUAL CONTACT WITH ANY ARTICLE MADE OF METAL WHICH IN THE LOW STATE OF THE TEMPERATURE WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE TAKEN ALL THE SKIN OFF THEIR HANDS AS MUCH AS IF IT HAD BEEN RED-HOT
HE MUST DO THE BEST HE COULD
EXCEPT THE THIRTEEN ENGLISHMEN WHO HAD BEEN LEFT AT GIBRALTAR EVERY LIVING CREATURE HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THE DARK ABYSS OF THE VOLCANO'S CRATER
IN FACT IT WAS PRECISELY SUCH AS IT WOULD APPEAR TO AN OBSERVER ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET VENUS
YOU WILL GET NO MORE
THERE WAS NO TIME NOW FOR CONCERTING MEASURES OFFHAND TO PREVENT THE DISASTER FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PARTY HAD ALREADY REACHED THE SPOT WHERE THE HANSA LAY BOUND IN HER ICY TRAMMELS
IN FACT THEY THEMSELVES OCCASIONALLY FELL A PREY TO THE SAME LASSITUDE BOTH OF BODY AND MIND
SHARP
SERVADAC'S MIND OF COURSE TURNED TO THE CARGO ON BOARD THE HANSA AND HE RESOLVED ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE TO APPLY TO THE JEW AND BECOME A PURCHASER
OR ON THE OTHER HAND MIGHT IT NOT BE ATTRACTED TO THE GREAT CENTRAL SOURCE OF LIGHT AND HEAT AND BE ABSORBED IN IT
A MATHEMATICIAN SHOULD NOT WANT BREATHING TIME
A FEW MORE LEAGUES AND THEY OUGHT TO BE ABREAST OF THE SHORES OF FRANCE
WITH THIS REFLECTION THE TWO MEN SILENTLY DESCENDED THE MOUNTAIN AND REMOUNTED THEIR HORSES
COUNT TIMASCHEFF FINALLY SUGGESTED THOUGH SOMEWHAT DOUBTFULLY THE QUESTION OF THE PROBABILITY THAT GALLIA IN HER COURSE ACROSS THE ZONE OF THE MINOR PLANETS HAD CARRIED OFF ONE OF THEM
HOW AM I TO GO ON
ALL RIGHT
I FIND THEM UNWORN AND UNCHIPPED
THEN TO-DAY SAID THE ASTRONOMER SPEAKING WITH THE GREATEST DELIBERATION--"TO-DAY WE ARE JUST THREE MILLIONS OF LEAGUES AWAY FROM EUROPE THE JEW WAS UTTERLY CRESTFALLEN
THEY DESCENDED TO THE LEVEL OF THE FROZEN WATER AND MADE THEIR WAY TOWARDS THE LITTLE CREEK WHERE THE DOBRYNA AND THE HANSA LAY FIRMLY IMPRISONED IN THEIR ICY BONDS
THEIR EXTREME AVIDITY WAS RECOGNIZED AS A PROOF THAT ANY LAND WHERE THEY COULD OBTAIN A SUSTENANCE MUST BE FAR REMOTE
IF IN TRUTH A CERTAIN MASS HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF FROM THE TERRESTRIAL SPHERE WHITHER WOULD IT WEND ITS WAY
I HOPE YOU ARE
ON THE OTHER HAND BY TAKING AN EASTWARD COURSE NOT ONLY WOULD THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE WIND BUT UNDER STEAM AND CANVAS MIGHT HOPE IN A FEW DAYS TO BE OFF THE COAST OF EGYPT AND FROM ALEXANDRIA OR SOME OTHER PORT THEY WOULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING TIDINGS FROM EUROPE AS THEY WOULD AT GIBRALTAR
IT WAS COVERED WITH A NETWORK THAT HAD BEEN MADE FROM THE LIGHT RIGGING OF THE YACHT AND THE CAR COMPOSED OF WICKER-WORK THAT HAD FORMED PARTITIONS IN THE HOLD OF THE HANSA WAS QUITE COMMODIOUS ENOUGH TO HOLD THE TWENTY-THREE PASSENGERS IT WAS INTENDED TO CONVEY
NOTHING COULD BE SEEN OF ORLEANSVILLE WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN ABOUT SIX MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST
DISCUSSIONS AROSE IN SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES
BUT RATHER THAN ABANDON HIS CLOSE AND PERSONAL OVERSIGHT OF HIS PRECIOUS CARGO HE PREFERRED TO SACRIFICE HIS OWN SLENDER STOCK OF FUEL
BEN ZOOF WHAT ARE YOU WHAT AM I
FOLLOW ME SHOUTED SERVADAC AGAIN
TWENTY-TWO PEOPLE ON THIS ISLAND
IT IS AN ENGLISH SHIP NO DOUBT IN HALF AN HOUR TWO MASTS WERE VISIBLE ABOVE THE HORIZON
BUT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE VIGOROUSLY ATTACKED BY STONES AND STICKS AND EVEN OCCASIONALLY BY SHOT IT WAS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY THAT THEIR NUMBER COULD BE SENSIBLY REDUCED
OR LASTLY ITS COURSE MIGHT BE SO RETARDED THAT IT WOULD ONLY REACH THE ECLIPTIC TOO LATE TO PERMIT ANY JUNCTION WITH THE EARTH
THE INTERVIEW WOULD OFTEN TERMINATE IN A SCENE OF CONSIDERABLE ANIMATION
ASSUREDLY IF THE POOR PROFESSOR HAD HAD ANY FLESH TO LOSE HE WOULD HAVE WITHERED AWAY TO A SHADOW
EVERYBODY IS VERY CLEVER
BRAVO HE SAID WE SHOULD MAKE A GOOD PAIR OF CLOWNS BUT THE CAPTAIN WAS INCLINED TO TAKE A MORE SERIOUS VIEW OF THE MATTER
SHALL WE ALLEGE A MUSICAL DISPUTE
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT SAID ROSETTE WITH MANIFEST SATISFACTION
MADALENA WHERE THEY HAD PICKED UP THE LITTLE ITALIAN GIRL
THEY WOULD BOTH LIKE SO MUCH TO GET BACK TO THE OLD FARM
A FRESH SATELLITE IN THE GLOOM OF NIGHT WAS SHINING CONSPICUOUSLY BEFORE THEM
ADDING AND I CONFESS I AM ALMOST IN DESPAIR WHETHER WE SHALL EVER ASCERTAIN ITS LIMITS
THE INQUIRY THAT WE HAVE NOW TO MAKE IS WHETHER WE ARE PREPARED FOR THE COMING SHOCK
IT WILL BE ADVISABLE I THINK FOR THIS DISCUSSION TO BE CARRIED ON IN THE OPEN AIR AND HURRIEDLY HE LEFT THE ROOM
AND WAS THERE NO CHANCE OF ITS EVER UNITING AGAIN WITH THE GLOBE FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN TORN OFF BY SO SUDDEN AND VIOLENT A DISRUPTION
THE VERY NEXT DAY THE SMALL COMMUNITY WAS BROKEN UP
IT WAS MAJOR OLIPHANT HIMSELF
YES OR NO
THE LEAVE TAKING WAS ACCOMPANIED BY GENUINE TOKENS OF REGARD AND GOODWILL
ADDING FOR HE HAD BECOME DISTRUSTFUL OF THE FUTURE THAT IS TO SAY IF TO-MORROW EVER COMES ALTHOUGH NOT VERY LEARNED IN ASTRONOMY SERVADAC WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE POSITION OF THE PRINCIPAL CONSTELLATIONS
ALTOGETHER WITH WHAT HE HAD BEFORE HE NOW POSSESSED THE ROUND SUM OF 150,000 FRANCS HALF OF WHICH WAS IN STERLING GOLD
THE COLONY TOOK POSSESSION OF THEIR NEW ABODE WITH BUT FEW FORMALITIES
YOU ARE TO MAKE UP THE DEFICIENCY EXCLAIMED BEN ZOOF
FAREWELLS OVER THE DOBRYNA WAS CAREFULLY STEERED THROUGH THE CREEK AND WAS SOON UPON THE OPEN SEA
THEY WERE NOT LONG IN ASCERTAINING THAT ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE POINT THERE WAS A SMALL WELL-SHELTERED CREEK OF SUFFICIENT DEPTH TO ACCOMMODATE A VESSEL OF MODERATE TONNAGE
STRANGE TO SAY LITTLE NINA BORE HER HARDSHIPS MORE BRAVELY THAN ANY OF THEM
IT WAS ON THAT DAY WE CROSSED THE ORBIT OF MARS YES TRUE ASSENTED THE OTHERS
WITH THE INTENTION OF CLEARING IT HE MADE A SPRING WHEN A LOUD CRY BURST FROM SERVADAC
AFTER SEEING THE VESSELS MADE SECURE IN THE FROZEN CREEK
BUT BY THE NIGHT OF THE 13TH THE TEMPEST APPEARED TO HAVE SPENT ITS FURY
IT CONTAINS 70 PER CENT
OUR ENGINE WAS DAMAGED NAY DISABLED AND WE DRIFTED ENTIRELY AT THE MERCY OF THE TERRIBLE HURRICANE THAT RAGED DURING THE SUCCEEDING DAYS
WHO CAN TELL WHETHER WE SHALL NOT COME ACROSS A HUMAN BEING LIEUTENANT PROCOPE LOOKED DOUBTFUL
IT MAY BE THE EQUATOR WHERE WE ARE
I SEE THAT COLONEL MURPHY HAS JUST TELEGRAPHED HIS NEXT MOVE
WE MUST CUT IT OUT OF THE SAILS OF THE DOBRYNA
LET US GET AT ITS WEIGHT AND WE SHALL HAVE THE KEY WHICH WILL UNLOCK THE PROBLEM OF THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF GALLIA
NOT UNMINDFUL OF THE WARNING HE HAD RECEIVED THE CORPORAL WAS MOST CAREFUL BETWEEN EACH DISCHARGE TO SEE THAT EVERY VESTIGE OF FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED SO AS TO PREVENT AN UNTIMELY EXPLOSION WHILE THE MEN WERE RELOADING
THE CORPORAL SOON MADE HIS APPEARANCE SMACKING HIS LIPS HAVING BY A READY INTUITION FOUND A PRETEXT FOR A DOUBLE MORNING RATION OF SPIRITS
WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO FIGHT OUR DUEL AFTER ALL MOST HAPPY TO BE EXCUSED REJOINED THE COUNT
THE WORDS WON'T RHYME
THEY WERE ALL ANDALUSIAN MAJOS AGRICULTURAL LABORERS AND NATURALLY AS CARELESS AND APATHETIC AS MEN OF THEIR CLASS USUALLY ARE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP BEING VERY CONSIDERABLY EMBARRASSED WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE LEFT IN SOLITUDE UPON A DETACHED AND ISOLATED ROCK
BUT WHY NOT AGAIN ASKED SERVADAC IMPETUOUSLY
AND AS IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT SERVADAC WOULD RESIGN HIS INTENTION OF GOING IN PERSON TO RELIEVE HIS FELLOW-COUNTRYMAN PROCOPE SUBMITTED HIS OWN WISHES TO THE COUNT
THEN I AM TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE DETERMINED TO RETAIN YOUR TWO GARRISONS HERE AND AT GIBRALTAR ASKED SERVADAC WITH ONE LAST EFFORT AT PERSUASION
THIS WAS A MATTER OF LITTLE LABOR
BEHIND A HUGE PYRAMIDAL ROCK THEY FOUND A HOLE IN THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE LIKE THE MOUTH OF A GREAT TUNNEL
HE CLUNG TO HIS POST WITH THE GREATER PERSISTENCY BECAUSE HIS CALCULATIONS HAD LED HIM TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE COMET WOULD STRIKE THE EARTH SOMEWHERE TO THE SOUTH OF ALGERIA AND AS IT HAD A SOLID NUCLEUS HE FELT SURE THAT AS HE EXPRESSED IT THE EFFECT WOULD BE UNIQUE AND HE WAS ANXIOUS TO BE IN THE VICINITY
PERHAPS NOW THE HUGE DISC OF WHICH HE HAD HAD AN IMPERFECT GLIMPSE ON THE NIGHT OF THE 31ST OF DECEMBER MIGHT AGAIN REVEAL ITSELF
ALL RIGHT PARFAIT THERE WAS A GENERAL SIGH OF DISAPPOINTMENT
BUT ALTHOUGH THIS MIGHT GET OVER THE DIFFICULTY OF THE ALTERED ALTITUDE OF THE SUN AND THE ABSENCE OF TWILIGHT YET IT WOULD NEITHER ACCOUNT FOR THE SUN SETTING IN THE EAST NOR FOR THE LENGTH OF THE DAY BEING REDUCED TO SIX HOURS
A TRAY WAS SUSPENDED TO THE HOOK AND UPON THIS COFFEE WAS THROWN UNTIL THE NEEDLE REGISTERED THE WEIGHT OF ONE POUND
WELL THEN SAID THE PROFESSOR I MUST REMIND YOU
AND THE TWO OFFICERS WITH THEIR SIMILAR TASTES IDEAS AND DISPOSITIONS GOT ON TOGETHER ADMIRABLY
IN HIS LEISURE MOMENTS RHYMES SUITABLE AND UNSUITABLE POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE WERE PERPETUALLY JINGLING IN HIS IMAGINATION
HE IS A THIEF CAPTAIN SERVADAC LOOKED STERNLY AT HAKKABUT
SECONDLY THAT THE DISTANCE OF THE PLANET FROM THE SUN WHICH ON THE 15TH OF FEBRUARY HAD BEEN 59,000,000 LEAGUES WAS ON THE 1ST OF MARCH 78,000,000 LEAGUES--AN INCREASE OF 19,000,000 LEAGUES IN A FORTNIGHT
WHILST A THIRD RECESS IMMEDIATELY AT THE BACK MADE A CONVENIENT LITTLE CHAMBER FOR NINA
THIS WAS VEGA IN THE CONSTELLATION LYRA A STAR WHICH ACCORDING TO THE PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF OUR POLE-STAR 12,000 YEARS HENCE
A BALLOON HE EXCLAIMED
THE BASEMENT OF THE ICY PEDESTAL ON WHICH THE SHIPS HAD BEEN UPHEAVED WAS GRADUALLY UNDERMINED LIKE THE ICEBERGS OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN BY WARM CURRENTS OF WATER AND ON THE NIGHT OF THE 12TH THE HUGE BLOCK COLLAPSED EN MASSE SO THAT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING NOTHING REMAINED OF THE DOBRYNA AND THE HANSA EXCEPT THE FRAGMENTS SCATTERED ON THE SHORE
IF AT ANY TIME IT SHOULD DISPERSE IT WOULD EITHER FALL INTO FRAGMENTS UPON THE SURFACE OF SATURN OR THE FRAGMENTS MUTUALLY COALESCING WOULD FORM ADDITIONAL SATELLITES TO CIRCLE ROUND THE PLANET IN ITS PATH
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED SERVADAC LOOKING AT HIS WATCH WHICH HE HAD SET AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE BY THE SUN BEFORE LEAVING THE GOURBI
BUT WHERE ON THIS LEVEL ICE-FIELD WILL YOU FIND SHELTER IN YOUR PERIODS OF REST
THEY HAD NONE OF THEM LONG TO WAIT FOR WITHIN A FEW MINUTES ROSETTE'S PEEVISH VOICE WAS HEARD CALLING JOSEPH
FOR MY OWN PART I MUST ADHERE TO MY BELIEF THAT IT WILL BE ADVISABLE TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING
READ IT OFF HE SAID
AND THE RECREATION OF SKATING THUS OPPORTUNELY PROVIDED SEEMED JUST THE THING TO AROUSE THE FLAGGING SPIRITS AND TO RESTORE A WHOLESOME EXCITEMENT
THE WHOLE REGION APPEARED TO CONSIST OF NOTHING BUT THE SAME STRANGE UNIFORM MINERAL CONGLOMERATE CRYSTALLIZED INTO REGULAR HEXAGONAL PRISMS
THE ASTRONOMER BY THE RETURN OF THE EXPEDITION CONVEYING ITS CONTRIBUTION FROM FORMENTERA THE KNOWN POPULATION OF GALLIA WAS RAISED TO A TOTAL OF THIRTY-SIX
JUST AT THIS MOMENT LIEUTENANT PROCOPE OBSERVED THAT THE COMET DEVIATED SENSIBLY IN AN OBLIQUE COURSE
WHERE'S MY BLACKBOARD JOSEPH QUITE SAFE SIR ANSWERED BEN ZOOF QUICKLY
THERE'S YOUR COFFEE MAN BEN ZOOF SAID
ECCENTRICITIES OF NATURE SAID THE MAJOR CANNOT INTERFERE WITH MILITARY REGULATIONS
BUT NO DANGER WAS TO BE APPREHENDED FROM MERCURY
THEY ARE ALL FATALISTS
LET ME SEE SAID THE CAPTAIN
MERCIFUL HEAVENS SCREAMED ISAAC
ANOTHER HYPOTHESIS THAT PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIS MIND WAS THAT THE AFRICAN COAST MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUDDENLY TRANSPORTED TO THE EQUATORIAL ZONE
TOO IMPATIENT TO AWAIT THE AWAKENING OF THE ASTRONOMER AND TO HEAR WHAT REPRESENTATIONS HE HAD TO MAKE SERVADAC THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT CONSTITUTING THEMSELVES WHAT MIGHT BE DESIGNATED THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE COLONY SPENT THE WHOLE OF THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY IN STARTING AND DISCUSSING THE WILDEST CONJECTURES ABOUT THEIR SITUATION
FRENCH MONEY
AND ITS VERY MILL PRODUCED NO ORDINARY FLOUR BUT PROVIDED MATERIAL FOR CAKES OF WORLD-WIDE RENOWN
KEEP YOUR CARGO TO YOURSELF
THEIR BREATH ISSUED IN VAPOR WHICH WAS AT ONCE CONGEALED INTO LITTLE CRYSTALS UPON THEIR WHISKERS BEARDS EYEBROWS AND EYELASHES UNTIL THEIR FACES COVERED WITH COUNTLESS SNOW-WHITE PRICKLES WERE TRULY LUDICROUS
EVEN IN HIS SLEEP ROSETTE'S IRRITABLE NATURE REVEALED ITSELF
ONLY TELL THEM WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND IN SHEER DESPONDENCY THEY WILL NOT DO ANOTHER STROKE OF WORK BESIDES SAID LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WHO TOOK VERY MUCH THE SAME VIEW AS THE ORDERLY THEY ARE SO MISERABLY IGNORANT THEY WOULD BE SURE TO MISUNDERSTAND YOU UNDERSTAND OR MISUNDERSTAND REPLIED SERVADAC I DO NOT THINK IT MATTERS
THE CONSTELLATIONS GLEAMED FORTH WITH UNSULLIED LUSTER
AFTER PONDERING ONE DAY HE SAID
WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT
AT LENGTH A SMALL SEMI-CIRCULAR CREEK WAS DISCOVERED AMONG THE ROCKS WHICH APPEARED ADVANTAGEOUS BECAUSE IF CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD SO REQUIRE IT WOULD FORM A SAFE ANCHORAGE FOR BOTH THE DOBRYNA AND THE HANSA
AND THIS INVOLVED THE NECESSITY OF FELLING THE NUMEROUS TREES THAT WERE SCATTERED OVER THE PLAIN
ALTHOUGH IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT OUR SUN IS APPROACHING THE CONSTELLATION OF HERCULES AT THE RATE OF MORE THAN 126,000,000 MILES A YEAR AND ALTHOUGH ARCTURUS IS TRAVELING THROUGH SPACE AT THE RATE OF FIFTY-FOUR MILES A SECOND--THREE TIMES FASTER THAN THE EARTH GOES ROUND THE SUN,--YET SUCH IS THE REMOTENESS OF THOSE STARS THAT NO APPRECIABLE CHANGE IS EVIDENT TO THE SENSES
THE NEW TERRITORY OF WHICH HE HAD BECOME THE MONARCH HE NAMED GOURBI ISLAND
THE LARGE CAVE WAS LIGHTED BY THE DOBRYNA'S LAMPS WHILE SEVERAL LANTERNS SUSPENDED AT INTERVALS ALONG THE ACCLIVITY THAT LED TO THEIR DESERTED QUARTERS ABOVE GAVE A WEIRD PICTURESQUENESS TO THE SCENE THAT MIGHT VIE WITH ANY OF THE GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS NINA SAID BEN ZOOF
JUST AS IN A CIRCLE IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW THREE POINTS TO DETERMINE THE CIRCUMFERENCE
HE HAD TO REPEAT THE PROCESS WITH THE SUGAR AND COFFEE
NOT I SAID THE PROFESSOR
GALLIA OUT OF PLACE REPEATED SERVADAC AGITATED WITH ALARM
THE FUTURE HE SAID MUST PROVIDE FOR ITSELF
MOUNTAINS AND PLAINS WERE NO LONGER CONFUSED THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SEA AND SHORE WAS MORE PLAINLY IDENTIFIED AND INSTEAD OF BEING AS IT WERE DEPICTED ON A MAP THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH APPEARED AS THOUGH MODELLED IN RELIEF
THE SOLEMN ISOLATION OF THE ISLAND TOMB THE OPEN BREVIARY THE RITUAL OF THE ANCIENT ANNIVERSARY ALL COMBINED TO APPRISE HIM OF THE SANCTITY OF THE SPOT UPON WHICH HE STOOD
IT WAS A MATTER OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO HIM THAT THE GOURBI IN WHICH OF NECESSITY HE WAS QUARTERED WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND ILL-CONTRIVED
HE MUST HAVE BROUGHT NEWS FROM EUROPE WELL OLD MANASSEH WHAT IF HE HAS I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM CAN'T BE THE JEW SIDLED CLOSE UP TO BEN ZOOF AND LAYING HIS HAND ON HIS ARM SAID IN A LOW AND INSINUATING TONE I AM POOR YOU KNOW
IF BEN ZOOF HAD EXPRESSED HIS SENSATIONS IN WORDS HE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE FELT UP TO ANYTHING AND HE HAD EVEN FORGOTTEN TO TASTE SO MUCH AS A CRUST OF BREAD A LAPSE OF MEMORY OF WHICH THE WORTHY SOLDIER WAS RARELY GUILTY
TAKE CARE THEY ARE ALL GOOD
FOURIER ESTIMATES THAT EVEN IN THOSE VAST UNFATHOMABLE TRACTS THE TEMPERATURE NEVER DESCENDS LOWER THAN 60 DEGREES SAID PROCOPE
THE JEW FETCHED HIS STEELYARD AND A PACKET OF THE TOBACCO WAS SUSPENDED TO IT
HAVE YOU TO WHOM HAVE WE THE HONOR OF SPEAKING AT LAST INTERPOSED COLONEL MURPHY IN THE COLDEST AND MOST MEASURED TONE AND DRAWING HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT
IF WE CAN FIND OUT NOTHING ELSE WE MUST AT LEAST DISCOVER WHERE WE ARE MEANWHILE SIR MAY WE GO TO SLEEP CERTAINLY IF YOU LIKE AND IF YOU CAN NOTHING LOATH TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF HIS MASTER'S PERMISSION BEN ZOOF CROUCHED DOWN IN AN ANGLE OF THE SHORE THREW HIS ARMS OVER HIS EYES AND VERY SOON SLEPT THE SLEEP OF THE IGNORANT WHICH IS OFTEN SOUNDER THAN THE SLEEP OF THE JUST
THE SILENCE OF BEWILDERMENT WAS BROKEN AT LENGTH BY COUNT TIMASCHEFF MAKING INQUIRY WHETHER NOTHING HAD BEEN HEARD FROM ENGLAND EITHER BY TELEGRAPH OR BY ANY PASSING SHIP
THERE WAS HOWEVER NOT MUCH ROOM FOR THIS SANGUINE EXPECTATION FOR IF A NEW ASTEROID HAD THUS BEEN BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE IT MUST BE A SPHERE OF EXTREMELY LIMITED DIMENSIONS AND THERE COULD BE LITTLE CHANCE THAT IT EMBRACED MORE THAN THE MEREST FRACTION OF EITHER FRANCE OR RUSSIA
45 DEGREES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE EQUATOR THESE WONDERFUL RINGS WOULD PRESENT VARIOUS STRANGE PHENOMENA
OF COAL THERE WAS NONE
AND TAKE CARE THAT YOUR FELLOWS DON'T GET THEIR ARMS AND LEGS BLOWN OFF ADDED THE OFFICER
NOT THAT THE PROSPECT GAVE THEM MUCH CONCERN
BUT I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT BY CAREFUL OBSERVATION AT VARIOUS POINTS WE SHALL ARRIVE AT CONCLUSIONS WHICH NOT ONLY WILL DETERMINE OUR PATH BUT PERHAPS MAY CLEAR UP THE MYSTERY ABOUT OUR GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE ALLOW ME TO ASK SAID COUNT TIMASCHEFF WHETHER SUCH A NEW ASTEROID WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO ORDINARY MECHANICAL LAWS AND WHETHER ONCE STARTED IT WOULD NOT HAVE AN ORBIT THAT MUST BE IMMUTABLE DECIDEDLY IT WOULD SO LONG AS IT WAS UNDISTURBED BY THE ATTRACTION OF SOME CONSIDERABLE BODY
NOT SO JOLLY BEN ZOOF AS YOU FANCY SAID HIS MASTER
I OFTEN THINK JUPITER IS LIKE A PRODIGIOUS CLOCK WITH FOUR HANDS I ONLY HOPE THAT WE ARE NOT DESTINED TO MAKE A FIFTH HAND ANSWERED SERVADAC
HAVING BEEN APPOINTED TO MAKE A LOCAL LEVY HE HAD BEEN LIVING IN A GOURBI OR NATIVE HUT ON THE MOSTAGANEM COAST BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE MILES FROM THE SHELIF
NINA SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU WILL NOT BE AFRAID TO GO DOWN TO THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE MOUNTAIN WILL YOU NOT IF PABLO GOES REPLIED THE CHILD
ONE GREAT USE OF LEARNING SAID COUNT TIMASCHEFF WITH A SMILE IS TO MAKE US KNOW OUR OWN IGNORANCE WHILE THIS CONVERSATION HAD BEEN GOING ON LIEUTENANT PROCOPE HAD BEEN SITTING IN THOUGHTFUL SILENCE
DID I NOT UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE COLLISION THE CHARACTER OF THE COMET'S ORBIT HAS BEEN CHANGED YOU DID SIR DID YOU IMPLY THAT THE ORBIT HAS CEASED TO BE A PARABOLA JUST SO IS IT THEN AN HYPERBOLA
IN FACT HE BECAME SO INTOLERABLY ABUSIVE THAT SERVADAC THREATENED TO PUT HIM INTO IRONS UNLESS HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF PROPERLY
NO PAPER NO PAPER EXCLAIMED ISAAC
AND TO HIS EYES THE HEIGHTS AND DISTRICT OF MONTMARTRE REPRESENTED AN EPITOME OF ALL THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD
WITH MUCH SATISFACTION THEY EXPERIENCED AS THEY APPROACHED THE MOUNTAIN A SENSIBLE DIFFERENCE IN THE TEMPERATURE AND THEIR SPIRITS COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN RISE AT THE PROSPECT OF HAVING THEIR HOPES CONFIRMED THAT A DELIVERANCE FROM THE THREATENED CALAMITY HAD SO OPPORTUNELY BEEN FOUND
THE WIND BY A FORTUITOUS PROVIDENCE HAD SHIFTED INTO A FAVORABLE QUARTER
THE MOTION OF THE COMET AS BEING RETROGRADE OR UNLIKE THE PLANETS FROM EAST TO WEST
IT IS AS HARD TO FIND RHYMES AS TO RALLY FUGITIVE IN A BATTLE
PROCOPE SHOOK HIS HEAD
AND NOW CAME A SINGULAR PART OF THE STORY
IT IS THE CUSTOM
I SHALL KEEP MY WORD
ON THE EARTH IT WOULD HAVE REGISTERED A KILOGRAMME AS A KILOGRAMME
HE ENDEAVORED TO OBTAIN A POST AT THE OBSERVATORY BUT HIS UNGENIAL CHARACTER WAS SO WELL KNOWN IN SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES THAT HE FAILED IN HIS APPLICATION
THE WIND BEAT DEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COAST AND THE DANGER INCURRED BY A VESSEL OF A TONNAGE SO LIGHT WAS NECESSARILY VERY GREAT
HE WOULDN'T KEEP US LONG IN THE DARK IF HE THOUGHT WE WERE NOT GOING BACK TO THE EARTH AGAIN
WHO'S THERE HE CRIED IN NO VERY AMIABLE TONE
ONCE SATISFIED THAT SERVADAC AND HIS FRIENDS WOULD COOPERATE WITH HIM IN THE RAID UPON THE THIEVES BEN ZOOF BECAME CALM AND CONTENT AND BEGAN TO MAKE VARIOUS INQUIRIES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
I AM GOVERNOR HERE SAID SERVADAC
WHY I AM THE POPULATION THE CAPTAIN DEIGNED NO REPLY BUT MUTTERING SOME EXPRESSIONS OF REGRET FOR THE FRUITLESS TROUBLE HE HAD TAKEN ABOUT HIS RONDO BETOOK HIMSELF TO REST
I MUST HAVE GALLIAN PRICES--AND OF MY OWN FIXING TOO SO LARGE A PORTION OF THE VESSEL HAD BEEN APPROPRIATED TO THE CARGO THAT THE SPACE RESERVED FOR THE CABIN WAS OF MOST MEAGER DIMENSIONS
THE GREAT CLIMAX CLOSE AT HAND
ROSETTE'S LANGUAGE BECAME MORE AND MORE VIOLENT TILL SERVADAC FEIGNING TO BE PROVOKED BEYOND ENDURANCE CRIED
A SEARCH FOR ALGERIA THE DOBRYNA A STRONG CRAFT OF 200 TONS BURDEN HAD BEEN BUILT IN THE FAMOUS SHIPBUILDING YARDS IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT
THE 18TH OF FEBRUARY YOU KNOW PIM SAID THE COLONEL
SHE DID NOT SAY A WORD BUT IMPRINTING A KISS UPON ITS SOFT PLUMAGE SHE SURRENDERED IT AT ONCE AND THE MESSAGE WAS HURRIEDLY FASTENED TO ITS NECK
WHY
THE ASTRONOMER HAD HARDLY PATIENCE TO HEAR HIM TO THE END
WELL THAT'S AS IT SHOULD BE
LOOK HERE
LOOK HERE
HAD THE COMET BEEN IN ANY WAY PROJECTED FROM ITS COURSE SO AS TO BE LIKELY TO FAIL IN COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THE EARTH THE PROFESSOR WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE UNABLE TO CONCEAL HIS SATISFACTION
BUT WHETHER HE SPEAKS FRENCH RUSSIAN SPANISH GERMAN OR ITALIAN HE IS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN A JEW CHAPTER XX
IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE CEREALS
TRUE REPLIED ROSETTE 630,000 SQUARE MILES
HAVING ENTERED THE TOWN CAPTAIN SERVADAC MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS MATMORE THE MILITARY QUARTER AND WAS NOT LONG IN FINDING TWO FRIENDS ON WHOM HE MIGHT RELY--A MAJOR OF THE 2ND FUSILEERS AND A CAPTAIN OF THE 8TH ARTILLERY
LOOKING UP HE NOW SAID INCIDENT TO THIS EXPECTED SHOCK THERE MAY BE A VARIETY OF DANGERS
SOMETIMES THEY WOULD APPEAR AS AN ILLUMINATED ARCH WITH THE SHADOW OF SATURN PASSING OVER IT LIKE THE HOUR-HAND OVER A DIAL
BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS BY FAR THE MOST ENLIGHTENED OF THEM ALL HE WAS QUITE INCAPABLE OF FORMING THE LEAST CONCEPTION OF THE NATURE OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED
NOTHING INDUCED THEM TO BREAK THEIR RESERVE
THUS BADGERED HE SECLUDED HIMSELF MORE THAN EVER IN HIS DISMAL HOLE NEVER VENTURING EXCEPT WHEN ABSOLUTELY OBLIGED TO FACE THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY
THE CALCULATED TIME OF IMPACT WAS 2 HOURS 47 MINUTES 35.6 SECONDS
LOOK HE EXCLAIMED POINTING TO A FAINT OUTLINE THAT BROKE THE MONOTONY OF THE CIRCLE THAT DIVIDED THE PLAIN FROM THE SKY
IT MUST BE NEAR SETTING SETTING CAPTAIN
FORWARD CRIED SERVADAC FIRMLY
I WILL GIVE YOU LEAVE TO HEAR WHAT THIS STRANGER HAS TO TELL AS SOON AS HE IS ABLE TO TELL US ANYTHING
BUT CAPTAIN SERVADAC IN A WAY THAT DID HONOR TO HIS GENEROSITY REPRESENTED THAT HOWEVER UNCOURTEOUS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THEIR FORMER BEHAVIOR IT WAS AT LEAST DUE TO THEM THAT THEY SHOULD BE INFORMED OF THE TRUE CONDITION OF THINGS WHICH THEY HAD HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING
BUT WE HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION OF ABANDONING OUR POST
WHEN THE SUN REAPPEARED ON THE WESTERN HORIZON THE PROFESSOR WAS STILL SOUND ASLEEP
A SINUOUS IRREGULARITY OF THE COAST HAD FORMED A KIND OF COVE WHICH THOUGH HARDLY SPACIOUS ENOUGH FOR A FEW FISHING-SMACKS WOULD AFFORD THE YACHT A TEMPORARY ANCHORAGE SO LONG AS THE WIND DID NOT BLOW VIOLENTLY FROM EITHER WEST OR SOUTH
PURSUING ITS INVERTED COURSE THE SUN ROSE AND SET WITH UNDEVIATING REGULARITY
EUREKA AGAIN SHRIEKED THE LITTLE MAN
SIXTY DEGREES BELOW ZERO CRIED THE COUNT
THE VISITS CONSEQUENTLY TO THE LONG-NEGLECTED GALLERIES OF NINA'S HIVE BECAME MORE AND MORE FREQUENT
I CONFESS SAID THE LIEUTENANT THAT JUST AT PRESENT I AM NOT ABLE TO CLEAR AWAY THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE
NOW WOULD HAVE BEEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEMAND OF THE ENTHUSIAST WHETHER HE WOULD LIKE TO PROLONG HIS RESIDENCE INDEFINITELY UPON HIS LITTLE COMET
BY THE BEGINNING OF THE FOLLOWING MONTH HALF OF THIS ZONE HAD BEEN TRAVERSED AND ONLY TWO MONTHS REMAINED BEFORE THE COLLISION WITH THE EARTH WAS TO BE EXPECTED
THERE WAS NO ADVANTAGE IN PROCEEDING ANY FURTHER ALONG THE LAVA-COURSE
OH WE WILL DEAL GENTLY WITH YOU
CAPTAIN SERVADAC THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT WERE GENERALLY SEEN TOGETHER
I THOUGHT NOT
HELP SCREAMED HAKKABUT
AND BY AN EFFORT OF MEMORY HE MANAGED TO RECALL SOME GENERAL LAWS WHICH HE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN
I HAVE NEVER MADE ANY VERSES BUT I HAVE SEEN THEM MADE FAST ENOUGH AT A BOOTH DURING THE FETE OF MONTMARTRE CAN YOU REMEMBER THEM REMEMBER THEM
LOOK OUT PABLO
DO YOU SEE ANYONE BEN ZOOF ASKED THE CAPTAIN AT LAST
NICE LITTLE COMET MUTTERED BEN ZOOF
BUT THIS ONLY SERVED TO AWAKEN A KEENER INTEREST ABOUT THE FUTURE
THE WORTHY FELLOW WAS UNWILLING TO OWN THAT EVEN IN THE MATTER OF HEAT THE TROPICS COULD IN ANY WAY SURPASS HIS OWN MUCH-LOVED HOME
NO SAID THE COLONEL
MOREOVER IT WOULD BE UNNECESSARY FOR THEM TO CONFINE THEMSELVES ENTIRELY TO THE SECLUSION OF THEIR GLOOMY RESIDENCE
BUT WHATEVER WAS ITS GEOLOGICAL CHARACTER IT WAS ONLY TOO EVIDENT THAT IT HAD ENTIRELY REPLACED THE FORMER SOIL SO THAT NOT A VESTIGE OF THE OLD CONTINENT OF EUROPE COULD BE DISCERNED
A GENERAL ALTERCATION HAD ARISEN FROM A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SAILOR PANOFKA AND CORPORAL PIM
AFTER A MOMENT OR TWO'S REFLECTION HE TURNED TO SERVADAC AND ASKED HIM WHETHER IT WAS NOT THE MIDDLE OF APRIL
AND THE OUTER OF A DUSKY HUE BEING 8,660 MILES BROAD
THIS WAS THE POOL IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE CENTRAL CAVERN THE RECEPTACLE FOR THE STREAM OF BURNING LAVA
A TARTAN A SMALL VESSEL OF TWO HUNDRED TONS BURDEN CONVEYED HIS ENTIRE STOCK OF MERCHANDISE AND TO SAY THE TRUTH WAS A SORT OF FLOATING EMPORIUM CONVEYING NEARLY EVERY POSSIBLE ARTICLE OF COMMERCE FROM A LUCIFER MATCH TO THE RADIANT FABRICS OF FRANKFORT AND EPINAL
PERMIT ME TO ASK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION HE SAID
THE MAN BOWED HIS HEAD IN SERVILE SUBMISSION AND FOLDED HIS HANDS UPON HIS BREAST
AND HAVING SUBSCRIBED IT WITH HIS SIGNATURE TURNED TO NINA AND TOLD HER HE MUST HAVE THE CARRIER-PIGEON WHICH WAS NESTLING IN HER BOSOM
IN THE EVENING AS THE SUN WAS SINKING BELOW THE EASTERN HORIZON CAPTAIN SERVADAC WAS LOUNGING MOODILY AGAINST THE TAFFRAIL
NO LONGER RUSSIAN FRENCH OR ENGLISH
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUPPLY OF FUEL ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO COLLECT EVERY SCRAP OF WOOD DRY OR GREEN THAT THE ISLAND PRODUCED
YOU NO DOUBT HAVE ESCAPED THE SAME DISASTER AS OURSELVES BUT THE ENGLISH OFFICERS NEITHER BY WORD NOR GESTURE MADE THE SLIGHTEST ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THIS FAMILIAR GREETING
BUT IT WAS NO CRY OF TERROR
BUT THE ORDERLY MADE NO SECRET OF HIS ANTIPATHY TO HIM AND GENERALLY REPLIED TO HIS ADVANCES EITHER BY SATIRE OR BY BANTER
WELL-NIGH ONE OF THEIR LAST TIES TO MOTHER EARTH HAD BEEN BROKEN
VIVE LA FRANCE CRIED THE CAPTAIN
THUS CONFIDENT IN THEIR ANTICIPATIONS NEITHER THE CAPTAIN THE COUNT NOR THE LIEUTENANT FELT UNDER ANY SERIOUS OBLIGATION TO MAKE ANY EXTENSIVE PROVISIONS FOR THE FUTURE
THE ONLY DISCONTENTED SPIRIT WAS ISAAC HAKKABUT
DAY AND NIGHT THEY PERCHED FEARLESSLY UPON THE YARDS THE REPORT OF A GUN FAILING TO DISLODGE THEM AND WHEN FOOD OF ANY SORT WAS THROWN UPON THE DECK THEY WOULD DART DOWN AND FIGHT WITH EAGER VORACITY FOR THE PRIZE
WHAT ARE WE TO DO NOW SIR WE CAN ONLY FOR THE PRESENT WAIT PATIENTLY WHERE WE ARE
THEY HAD RESIDED SO LONG IN THE PROVINCE THAT THEY COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT BE MISTAKEN AS TO THEIR WHEREABOUTS AND ALTHOUGH THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF CLEARING UP THE MYSTERIES THAT SHROUDED THE MIRACLE YET THEY WERE CONVINCED AT THE FIRST GLANCE THAT THEY HAD BEEN RETURNED TO THE EARTH AT THE VERY IDENTICAL SPOT WHERE THEY HAD QUITTED IT
NOT IN THE LEAST THAT THEY WOULD EXPECT TO MEET WITH ANY INHOSPITABLE REBUFF
WHEN CAPTAIN PARRY WAS ON MELVILLE ISLAND HE KNEW THE THERMOMETER TO FALL TO 56 DEGREES SAID PROCOPE
DID ITS ORBIT CORRESPOND WITH THE ORBIT OF THE ECLIPTIC
IN THE COURSE OF THE FEW MINUTES CONVERSATION WHICH BEN ZOOF HAD HELD WITH HIM HE HAD MENTIONED THAT HE KNEW THAT THE WHOLE SOIL OF GALLIA WAS MADE OF GOLD
QUIET BEN ZOOF SAID SERVADAC STERNLY
AFTER COMPLETING HIS YEAR OF ELEMENTARY STUDIES HECTOR SERVADAC HAD ENTERED THE SCHOOL AT SAINT CYR AND FROM THAT TIME HE AND HIS FORMER TUTOR HAD NEVER MET SO THAT NATURALLY THEY WOULD WELL-NIGH PASS FROM EACH OTHER'S RECOLLECTION
ALL THE REST OF THE DAY THE JEW WAS MUTTERING BITTER CURSES AGAINST THE THIEVES OF GENTILES IN GENERAL AND THE GOVERNOR OF GALLIA IN PARTICULAR WHO WERE ROBBING HIM OF HIS JUST PROFITS BY BINDING HIM DOWN TO A MAXIMUM PRICE FOR HIS GOODS JUST AS IF IT WERE A TIME OF REVOLUTION IN THE STATE
SIXTY-SIX POUNDS CRIED SERVADAC
NOT ONLY WOULD HE BE SEEN TOILING MORE FREQUENTLY UP THE ARDUOUS WAY THAT LAY BETWEEN HIS NOOK BELOW AND HIS TELESCOPE ABOVE BUT HE WOULD BE HEARD MUTTERING IN AN ANGRY TONE THAT INDICATED CONSIDERABLE AGITATION
NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE CAN SAVE US NOW
AND THEN BEGAN A LIFE OF DREARY MONOTONY
WHY SHOULD GALLIA BE EXEMPT FROM THE DESTINY THAT SEEMED TO AWAIT EVERY OTHER HEAVENLY BODY
CONSTANT EVER I WILL BE CONSTANT HIS NEXT THOUGHT WAS TO WONDER WHAT HAD HAPPENED
THREE DAYS LATER THE MOON WAS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SUN AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY LOST TO VIEW
ACROSS THE QUARTER OF A MILE OF LEVEL GROUND THAT LAY BETWEEN THE MOUNTAIN AND THE CREEK A SERIES OF FOOTPRINTS FROZEN HARD INTO THE SNOW MARKED THE COURSE TAKEN BY ISAAC HAKKABUT ON HIS LAST RETURN FROM NINA'S HIVE
MOMENTS WERE PRECIOUS
A PUFF OF WIND WOULD BLOW IT AWAY I MUST TAKE CARE OF MY HEAD THEN AND HOLD IT ON REPLIED THE IRREPRESSIBLE ORDERLY
AND IF IT REACHED AS PROBABLY IT DID BEYOND SICILY TO ITALY IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THE VAST BASIN OF THE MEDITERRANEAN WHICH HAD WASHED THE SHORES ALIKE OF EUROPE ASIA AND AFRICA MUST HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO ABOUT HALF ITS ORIGINAL AREA
IT WAS WRITTEN ENTIRELY IN FRENCH AND EXHIBITED NONE OF THE ECSTATIC EXCLAMATIONS IN OTHER LANGUAGES THAT HAD BEEN REMARKABLE IN THE TWO FORMER PAPERS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN FROM MY LITTLE TARTAN YONDER I SAW THE YAWL GO OUT FROM THE ROCK HERE ON A JOURNEY AND I SAW IT COME BACK AND IT BROUGHT A STRANGER
ON ONE OCCASION SERVADAC IN REFERENCE TO HIS ORDERLY'S INDOMITABLE PERSEVERANCE HAPPENED TO REMARK THAT HE THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BORN IN THE HEART OF EQUATORIAL AFRICA
CANNOT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE PLANETS ARE TRAVELING A THOUSAND TIMES FASTER THAN THE FASTEST EXPRESS AND THAT IF THEY MEET EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER MUST BE DESTROYED
IT WAS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY WHEN THE PROFESSOR BROUGHT HIS COMPLAINT TO CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND BEGGED HIM TO ASSIGN HIM A CHAMBER NO MATTER HOW SMALL IN WHICH HE SHOULD BE FREE TO CARRY ON HIS TASK IN SILENCE AND WITHOUT MOLESTATION
THE PROFESSOR PERPLEXED ANOTHER MONTH PASSED AWAY AND IT WAS NOW SEPTEMBER BUT IT WAS STILL IMPOSSIBLE TO LEAVE THE WARMTH OF THE SUBTERRANEAN RETREAT FOR THE MORE AIRY AND COMMODIOUS QUARTERS OF THE HIVE WHERE THE BEES WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN FROZEN TO DEATH IN THEIR CELLS
AN IMMENSE RELIEF SAID SERVADAC TO HIMSELF THAT I HAVE NO OCCASION TO FINISH THAT CONFOUNDED RONDO IT WAS AGREED BETWEEN THE CAPTAIN AND THE COUNT THAT IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE IN EVERY WAY TO MAINTAIN THE MOST RIGID SILENCE UPON THE SUBJECT OF THE INEXPLICABLE PHENOMENA WHICH HAD COME WITHIN THEIR EXPERIENCE
AND THE PLAN OF RETURNING THITHER WAS ON THE POINT OF BEING ADOPTED WHEN LIEUTENANT PROCOPE REMARKED THAT THEY OUGHT TO REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD NOT HITHERTO MADE AN ENTIRE CIRCUIT OF THE NEW SHORES OF THE SEA ON WHICH THEY WERE SAILING
I SHALL BE STRANGLED RASCAL
BUT THE MOUNTAIN WAS LIKE THE BODY OF A DYING MAN THAT RETAINS AWHILE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HEAT AT THE HEART AFTER THE EXTREMITIES HAVE BECOME COLD AND DEAD
HE WOULD NEXT PART WITH SOME MORE OF HIS CARGO FOR ALL THE PAPER MONEY THEY COULD GIVE HIM
IS THAT YOUR CONCLUSION LIEUTENANT I CONFESS I SEE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE ANSWERED PROCOPE CALMLY
I AM A SOLDIER SIR WAS THE SERVANT'S PROMPT REJOINDER AND I HAVE LEARNT TO KNOW THAT WHAT CAN'T BE CURED MUST BE ENDURED THE CAPTAIN MADE NO REPLY BUT FOR A TIME AT LEAST HE DESISTED FROM PUZZLING HIMSELF OVER MATTERS WHICH HE FELT HE WAS UTTERLY INCOMPETENT TO EXPLAIN
ON THE MOON THE ATTRACTION IS.16 WHILST ON THE SURFACE OF THE SUN A TERRESTRIAL KILOGRAMME WOULD WEIGH 28 KILOGRAMMES THEREFORE IF A MAN UPON THE SURFACE OF THE SUN WERE TO FALL DOWN HE WOULD HAVE CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN GETTING UP AGAIN
SERVADAC RAISED HIS WATCH TO HIS EAR
BY WAITING HE RECKONED HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRANSACT SOME LUCRATIVE BUSINESS
UNLIKE THE POLAR WINTERS OF THE EARTH WHICH ORDINARILY ARE AFFECTED BY ATMOSPHERIC INFLUENCE AND LIABLE TO SLIGHT INTERMISSIONS OF THEIR SEVERITY AT VARIOUS SHIFTINGS OF THE WIND GALLIA'S WINTER WAS CAUSED BY HER IMMENSE DISTANCE FROM THE SOURCE OF ALL LIGHT AND HEAT AND THE COLD WAS CONSEQUENTLY DESTINED TO GO ON STEADILY INCREASING UNTIL IT REACHED THE LIMIT ASCERTAINED BY FOURIER TO BE THE NORMAL TEMPERATURE OF THE REALMS OF SPACE
HERE ON THE CONTRARY THE VAST WHITE PLAIN WAS LEVEL AS THE DESERT OF SAHARA OR THE RUSSIAN STEPPES
HE WATCHED EVERY MOVEMENT LISTENED TO EVERY BREATH AND NEVER FAILED TO ADMINISTER THE STRONGEST CORDIALS UPON THE SLIGHTEST PRETEXT
BEN ZOOF'S HEART WAS TOO FULL FOR WORDS
WE HAVE HE SAID NEITHER INVESTIGATED THE NORTHERN SHORE FROM THE SITE OF CAPE ANTIBES TO THE STRAIT THAT BROUGHT US TO GIBRALTAR NOR HAVE WE FOLLOWED THE SOUTHERN SHORE THAT STRETCHES FROM THE STRAIT TO THE GULF OF CABES
THAT THE DOBRYNA ESCAPED AT ALL IS LITTLE LESS THAN A MIRACLE AND I CAN ONLY ATTRIBUTE HER SAFETY TO THE FACT THAT SHE OCCUPIED THE CENTER OF THE VAST CYCLONE AND CONSEQUENTLY DID NOT EXPERIENCE MUCH CHANGE OF POSITION HE PAUSED AND ADDED
IS THIS A FACT NO NO--YES--NO YOUR EXCELLENCY ONLY HE IS A CHEAT A THIEF ROARED THE EXCITED ASTRONOMER
I CAN'T SAY WHY NOT
IT WAS THE OPENING OF PALMYRIN ROSETTE'S OBSERVATORY
VERY DIFFERENT WAS THE CASE WITH PALMYRIN ROSETTE
STOP WHERE YOU LIKE HAKKABUT SAID THE CAPTAIN TO HIM
INSTEAD HOWEVER OF UTTERING ANY EXPRESSIONS OF WELCOME OR REJOICING AT THE CAPTAIN'S RETURN BEN ZOOF BROKE OUT INTO THE MOST VEHEMENT EJACULATIONS
AND LASTLY THE PRODUCE OF THE ISLAND ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE WHICH WITH PROPER ECONOMY MIGHT BE MADE TO LAST FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD
THE SURFACE OF A SPHERE
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEIR WILD CAREER BROUGHT THEM TO THE RIGHT BANK OF THE SHELIF
ONWARDS THUS FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE DOBRYNA FOLLOWED THE CONTOUR OF THE INHOSPITABLE COAST OF WHICH THE FEATURES WOULD OCCASIONALLY CHANGE SOMETIMES FOR TWO OR THREE MILES ASSUMING THE FORM OF A SIMPLE ARRIS SHARPLY DEFINED AS THOUGH CUT BY A CHISEL WHEN SUDDENLY THE PRISMATIC LAMELLAE SOARING IN RUGGED CONFUSION WOULD AGAIN RECUR
THAT THE WATERS ROARED FROM THEIR INNERMOST DEPTHS
AND MOREOVER IF IT IS MOVING THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY WORKING IT NOW HE WAS KEENLY DISAPPOINTED
NO PHENOMENON HOWEVER EXTRAORDINARY WOULD HAVE DRAWN FROM HIM A SINGLE EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE
STAY WHERE YOU ARE
BUT NOW GENTLEMEN ADDED THE PROFESSOR I MUST TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE
I HAVE IT NOW
WHERE IS HE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS HALF DREAMING ABOUT A FORMER SERVANT NOW FAR AWAY ON THE ANCIENT GLOBE
AND AS CALCULATIONS OF THIS KIND ARE ORDINARILY BASED UPON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE ORBIT IS A PARABOLA IT WAS NOT UNLIKELY THAT HE HAD BEEN ENDEAVORING TO TRACE THE PATH OF SOME PARTICULAR COMET
THE NEARER THAT GALLIA APPROACHED THE EARTH THE MORE A SORT OF RESERVE BEGAN TO SPRING UP BETWEEN THE CAPTAIN AND COUNT TIMASCHEFF
THE NARROW RAVINE WAS NOT ONLY PERFECTLY DRY BUT MANIFESTLY HAD NEVER BEEN THE BED OF ANY MOUNTAIN TORRENT
HIS EYES WANDERED FROM WHERE THE TAIL OF THE GREAT BEAR NOW A ZODIACAL CONSTELLATION WAS SCARCELY VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATERS TO WHERE THE STARS OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE WERE JUST BREAKING ON HIS VIEW
BACK AGAIN IN ALGERIA CAPTAIN YES BEN ZOOF IN ALGERIA
THEY ROB ME
COUNT TIMASCHEFF WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED WITH A MORE RIGOROUS INVESTIGATION WHEN THE ATTENTION OF ALL WAS ARRESTED BY A LOUD OUTCRY
ITS FORESTS HAD FLOURISHED LONG BEFORE THE INVASION OF THE CELTS
PARFAIT 87 5 ASTERIOD ASTEROID 130 13 COLONLY COLONY 143 17 TIN TAIN 161 30 EUROPE
TO THE DEPTH OF THOSE BOWELS WE MUST PENETRATE
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WHO HAD SEDULOUSLY INSERTED THE OUTLINE OF THE NEWLY REVEALED SHORE UPON THE MAPS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD CEASED TO RUN EAST AND WEST AND HAD TAKEN A TURN DUE NORTH THUS FORMING A BARRIER TO THEIR CONTINUING THEIR PREVIOUS DIRECTION
AS TO THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROFESSOR'S PREDICTION OF AN ULTIMATE RETURN TO THE TERRESTRIAL SPHERE THAT WAS A POINT ON WHICH IT MUST BE OWNED THAT THE CAPTAIN AFTER THE FIRST FLUSH OF HIS EXCITEMENT WAS OVER WAS NOT WITHOUT MANY MISGIVINGS
THE ENGINEER AND SEVERAL OF THE SAILORS SET VIGOROUSLY TO WORK AND BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE DAY THE YAWL WAS FURNISHED WITH A PAIR OF STOUT IRON RUNNERS CURVED UPWARDS IN FRONT AND FITTED WITH A METAL SCULL DESIGNED TO ASSIST IN MAINTAINING THE DIRECTNESS OF HER COURSE
HIS OATHS WERE SIMPLY DREADFUL
COME LET US BE OFF SAID HE TO HIS ORDERLY
A REVELATION TO THE GENERAL POPULATION OF THE COLONY THE ARRIVAL OF THE STRANGER WAS A MATTER OF SMALL INTEREST
HOW THEY HAD EXPERIENCED THE SHOCK
WHY NEHEMIAH HE SAYS HE SHAN'T GIVE YOU ANY MERCIFUL HEAVENS BEGAN THE JEW
IT WOULD THEREFORE BE NECESSARY IF THE EXACT DURATION OF GALLIA'S YEAR SHOULD EVER BE CALCULATED TO PROPORTION THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS TO BE RESERVED TO THE REAL LENGTH OF THE WINTER
IN A SWOON THEY HAD LEFT THE EARTH AND IN A SIMILAR SWOON THEY HAD COME BACK
THERE IS NO ROOM FOR QUESTIONING THAT THE TERRITORY HERE IS ENGLAND'S--ENGLAND'S BY RIGHT OF CONQUEST
AS SOON AS EVER THE OLD RASCAL FINDS THAT THERE ARE NO MORE ARABS OR ALGERIANS FOR HIM TO FLEECE HE WILL BE READY ENOUGH TO TRANSACT A LITTLE BUSINESS WITH US
ANOTHER MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE NIGHTS UPON SATURN IS THE TRIPLE RING WITH WHICH AS A BRILLIANT SETTING THE PLANET IS ENCOMPASSED
THE PLANES OF THEIR ORBITS DID NOT COINCIDE AND ACCORDINGLY THE DREADED CATASTROPHE DID NOT ENSUE
FIRST THAT WHEREAS IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY THE DISTANCE TRAVELED BY THE PLANET HYPOTHETICALLY CALLED GALLIA HAD BEEN RECORDED AS 82,000,000 LEAGUES THE DISTANCE TRAVELED IN FEBRUARY WAS ONLY 59,000,000 LEAGUES--A DIFFERENCE OF 23,000,000 LEAGUES IN ONE MONTH
I KNEW OUR COUNTRY WOULD NOT FORSAKE US
BEN ZOOF AND I CANNOT BOTH BE MAD THE ORDERLY MEANTIME SURVEYED HIS MASTER WITH THE GREATEST EQUANIMITY
AND SO MODEST YOU RASCAL ROARED THE PROFESSOR AND CLENCHED HIS HAND IN PASSION AS IF ABOUT TO STRIKE HIM
THEY HAD NOW A HOME IN WHICH THEY HAD NOTHING TO DESIRE
WHAT IF THERE SHOULD BE ANY ELEMENTS OF DISTURBANCE ON WHICH HE HAD NOT RECKONED
NO ONE WAS IN SIGHT
YOU JUST GET RID OF THAT POUCH OF YOURS OR WE WILL GET RID OF YOU
THE CAPTAIN MAKES AN EXPLORATION HECTOR SERVADAC WAS NOT THE MAN TO REMAIN LONG UNNERVED BY ANY UNTOWARD EVENT
THEY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CURB THEIR STEEDS BUT EVEN URGED THEM TO STILL GREATER EXERTIONS
DURING HIS RESIDENCE IN THE GOURBI HECTOR SERVADAC'S SOLE COMPANION WAS HIS ORDERLY BEN ZOOF
WATER BOILING AT A TEMPERATURE OF 66 DEGREES WAS ITSELF AN EVIDENCE THAT THE COLUMN OF AIR ABOVE THE EARTH'S SURFACE HAD BECOME REDUCED BY ONE-THIRD OF ITS ALTITUDE
WHAT PHENOMENON WAS THIS THAT HAD PRODUCED A CATACLYSM SO TREMENDOUS IN EFFECT UPON EARTH SKY AND SEA
WHAT MAKES YOU ASK SAID THE CAPTAIN CURIOUS TO HEAR WHAT THE JEW WOULD SAY
I AM SORRY
IT CORRESPONDS WITH THE 133D DAY OF THE TERRESTRIAL YEAR
POINTS OF THE COMPASS REVERSED
BUT AT NIGHT THE STARS SHONE WITH SURPASSING BRILLIANCY
WHAT COMPANY HAVE YOU HAD YOU COULD NOT SUPPOSE REPLIED THE ORDERLY THAT MY OWN UNASSISTED HANDS COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED ALL THAT HARVEST WORK THAT YOU SEE HAS BEEN DONE I CONFESS SAID LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WE DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE NOTICED THAT WELL THEN SAID BEN ZOOF IF YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO COME WITH ME FOR ABOUT A MILE I SHALL BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU MY COMPANIONS
THE IDIOTS HAVE PILOTED ME HERE FOR NOTHING FOR NOTHING
THE EARTH ATTENDED BY HER MOON CONTINUED TO ROTATE ALONG HER PROPER ORBIT
HE WAS NOT HOWEVER THE MAN TO PUZZLE HIMSELF FOR LONG OVER ANY INSOLUBLE PROBLEM
THE SILENCE OF A FEW MOMENTS WAS BROKEN BY SERVADAC SAYING DO YOU NOT THINK WE OUGHT TO EXPLAIN OUR SITUATION TO THE SPANIARDS NO NO YOUR EXCELLENCY BURST IN BEN ZOOF EMPHATICALLY
BY ESTIMATING HIS COMET AT A THIRD AS MUCH AGAIN AS ITS PROPER WEIGHT HE HAD FOUND THAT HIS CALCULATIONS WERE ALWAYS AT VARIANCE WITH THE OBSERVED SITUATION OF THE SATELLITE WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY INFLUENCED BY THE MASS OF ITS PRIMARY
A FEW EXCURSIONS IT IS TRUE WERE MADE IN THE DOWNWARD DIRECTION
NOT ONLY WOULD IT AFFORD AMPLE ACCOMMODATION FOR HECTOR SERVADAC AND HIS SUBJECTS AS BEN ZOOF DELIGHTED TO CALL THEM BUT IT WOULD PROVIDE SHELTER FOR THE TWO HORSES AND FOR A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS
IN THE COURSE OF THIS MONTH GALLIA WOULD TRAVEL 16,500,000 LEAGUES ATTAINING AT THE END A DISTANCE OF 197,000,000 LEAGUES FROM THE SUN
IT CANNOT BE THE SUN FOR THE SUN SET IN THE EAST ONLY AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO
SENSITIVE NATIONALITY WHEN THE SCHOONER HAD APPROACHED THE ISLAND THE ENGLISHMEN WERE ABLE TO MAKE OUT THE NAME DOBRYNA PAINTED ON THE AFT-BOARD
ITS POSITION WAS DULY TRACED ON THE DOBRYNA_'S CHART
THREE MATTERS OF INVESTIGATION ARE BEFORE US
A PERFECT CONCORD RULED THE LITTLE COLONY
IT WAS OF AN ORDINARY KIND
NEVER MIND SAID SERVADAC LET US GET OUR SLEDGE AND PUT THEM TO THE TEST
THE WIND CONTINUED FAVORABLE AND NOW UNDER BOTH STEAM AND CANVAS SHE MADE A RAPID PROGRESS TOWARDS THE NORTH A DIRECTION IN WHICH SHE WAS FREE TO GO IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE TOTAL DISAPPEARANCE OF THE SPANISH COAST FROM GIBRALTAR RIGHT AWAY TO ALICANTE
YET CERTAINLY EVEN AMID VERNE'S REMARKABLE WORKS HIS OFF ON A COMET MUST BE GIVEN HIGH RANK
THIS WAS A CUMBROUS MUZZLE-LOADER OF 9-INCH CALIBER AND IN DEFAULT OF THE SMALLER ORDNANCE GENERALLY EMPLOYED FOR THE PURPOSE HAD TO BE BROUGHT INTO REQUISITION FOR THE ROYAL SALUTE
THE NEW POLE-STAR CLOSE UPON THE HORIZON WAS RESPLENDENT AND EVEN HAD LIEUTENANT PROCOPE BEEN DESTITUTE OF A COMPASS HE WOULD HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN HOLDING HIS COURSE BY THE GUIDANCE OF THAT ALONE
THEY MADE AN ENTIRE CIRCUIT OF THE ISLAND AND BOTH AGREED THAT IT MUST BE BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THAT CIRCUMSCRIBED TERRITORY THAT THEY MUST SEEK AN EXPLANATION OF WHAT HAD SO STRANGELY TRANSPIRED
THE WEIGHT REGISTERED WAS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-THREE GRAMMES
THE RESULT WAS THAT CAPTAIN SERVADAC WAS DRIVEN TO THE IRRESISTIBLE CONCLUSION THAT THE TRACT OF LAND WHICH HE HAD BEEN SURVEYING WAS NOT AS HE HAD AT FIRST IMAGINED A PENINSULA
AND THE FIGURES OBVIOUSLY REFERRED TO THE ASTRONOMICAL WONDERS THAT HAD BEEN EXPERIENCED
OPERATIONS NOW COMMENCED FOR PREPARING PROPER WINTER QUARTERS
THE PLANET BEGAN TO ASSUME ENORMOUS DIMENSIONS AND IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF THE COMET HAD ALREADY BEEN DEFLECTED FROM ITS ELLIPTICAL ORBIT AND WAS RUSHING ON IN A STRAIGHT LINE TOWARDS THE OVERWHELMING LUMINARY
SWEDEN AND NORWAY WITH THEIR BRISTLING SPINE OF MOUNTAINS SEEMED LIKE A SPLENDID LION EAGER TO SPRING DOWN FROM THE BOSOM OF THE ICE-BOUND NORTH
BEDOUINS
BEFORE THE EVENING OF THIS DAY CLOSED IN A MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE WAS EFFECTED IN THE CONDITION OF THE GALLIAN SEA BY THE INTERVENTION OF HUMAN AGENCY
AND WHAT HAS BECOME HE SAID OF ALL OUR OLD COMRADES IN AFRICA AS FAR AS I CAN TELL YOU ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN THEY ARE ALL IN AFRICA STILL
GRANTED THAT YOU CAN ANSWERED THE LIEUTENANT QUIETLY
IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT AT 47 35.6 AFTER TWO O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THE FIRST OF JANUARY THERE WAS A COLLISION
NEVER DESPAIR TRUE SAID THE COUNT
WHY THEY WILL WEIGH IT WITH MY STEELYARD OF COURSE
MY COMET MERCIFUL HEAVEN SHRIEKED ISAAC FEIGNING CONSTERNATION AT THE BARE SUGGESTION
NOT AT ALL
OVERWHELMED BY THE QUESTIONS THAT CROWDED UPON HIS BRAIN CAPTAIN SERVADAC COULD ONLY WANDER UP AND DOWN THE SHORE
EARLY NEXT MORNING THIS HANDY LITTLE CRAFT WAS SUFFICIENTLY FREIGHTED WITH COAL OF WHICH THERE WAS STILL ABOUT TEN TONS ON BOARD THE DOBRYNA AND MANNED BY NOBODY EXCEPT THE CAPTAIN THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT LEFT THE HARBOR OF THE SHELIF MUCH TO THE BEWILDERMENT OF BEN ZOOF WHO HAD NOT YET BEEN ADMITTED INTO THE SECRET
THE VERY NOTES OF INTERROGATION ARE SIGNIFICANT THAT HE WAS IN DOUBT WHAT HE SHOULD WRITE YOU WOULD PRESUME THAT HE WAS A FRENCHMAN ASKED THE COUNT
A CANNON BALL TOO WOULD ONLY FLY A FEW YARDS SAID LIEUTENANT PROCOPE
NOT A SPECK APPEARED UPON THE DESOLATE HORIZON
NEXT DAY THE DIRECT PROGRESS OF THE DOBRYNA WAS ARRESTED BY A LONG PROJECTION OF LAND WHICH OBLIGED HER TO TURN SOUTHWARDS UNTIL SHE REACHED WHAT FORMERLY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF CORSICA
BEN ZOOF UNDERSTOOD THE CORRECTION
IT RAN UP IN AN ACUTE-ANGLED TRIANGLE TILL ITS APEX COINCIDED WITH THE VERY SPOT UPON WHICH MADRID HAD STOOD
WHAT COULD IT BE
AND AS THE EXTREME HEAT PRECLUDED ANY PROLONGED EXERTIONS IT WAS EVIDENT THE POPULATION OF THE ISLAND WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY AMOUNT OF LABOR
THE SPANIARDS AND THE RUSSIAN SAILORS TOOK UP THEIR SLEEPING-QUARTERS IN THE ADJACENT GALLERIES AND FOUND THE TEMPERATURE QUITE COMFORTABLE
IT WAS COMPLETELY DESERT
THE WONDROUS MIRROR IN THIS PLACE REVEALS YOUR FUTURE SWEETHEART'S FACE BOSH CRIED SERVADAC IN DISGUST
WHO SHALL PAINT THE LOOK OF CONSTERNATION WITH WHICH HE GAZED UPON THE STONY RAMPART--RISING PERPENDICULARLY FOR A THOUSAND FEET--THAT HAD REPLACED THE SHORES OF THE SMILING SOUTH
NOTHING COULD INDUCE HIM TO LEAVE HIS TARTAN WHERE LIKE A MISER HE WOULD KEEP GUARD OVER HIS PRECIOUS CARGO EVER GRUMBLING AND GROWLING BUT WITH HIS WEATHER-EYE OPEN IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING SIGHT OF SOME PASSING SAIL
THE VERY AIR SEEMED TO BE CONGEALED
CONFOUND IT CRIED THE IMPATIENT SERVADAC
PERHAPS IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SURPRISING THAT HE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN HIM
I WONDER TOO WHAT THE MINISTER OF WAR WILL SAY WHEN HE RECEIVES A TELEGRAM INFORMING HIM THAT HIS AFRICAN COLONY HAS BECOME NOT MORALLY BUT PHYSICALLY DISORGANIZED
PITCH IT OUT MAN PITCH IT OUT GOD OF ISRAEL WHINED HAKKABUT
UNSPARING OF HER FUEL THE DOBRYNA MADE HER WAY AT FULL STEAM TOWARDS CAPE BLANC
YOU WOULD ONLY BRING THEM AWAY TO DIE THE OBVIOUS AND DISPASSIONATE REASONING OF THE LIEUTENANT COULD NOT FAIL TO IMPRESS THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO LISTENED TO HIM
OUR SUPPOSITION THE CAPTAIN REPLIED IS THIS
THE LIEUTENANT DID NOT AT ONCE REPLY
ANXIOUS TO TURN THE SUBJECT SERVADAC TOOK THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING AND WHAT ABOUT MADAME DE L MADAME DE L EXCLAIMED THE COLONEL TAKING THE WORDS OUT OF HIS MOUTH
ALL AT ONCE WITH UNUTTERABLE VIOLENCE THE CAPTAIN AND HIS ORDERLY WERE DASHED FACE DOWNWARDS TO THE GROUND
I MEAN THE DOBRYNA_'S YAWL ANSWERED THE LIEUTENANT
THE REST OF THE VAST CONTINENT DISAPPEARED AS COMPLETELY AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT SEEMED BY NO MEANS STARTLING TO THE PHLEGMATIC COLONEL
HE WOULD HAVE IT ALL OUT OF THEM
BUT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE MODIFICATIONS WHICH THAT SHOCK HAS ENTAILED UPON MY COMET'S ORBIT I HAVE BEEN COMPELLED ENTIRELY TO RECOMMENCE MY CALCULATIONS THE LIEUTENANT LOOKED DISAPPOINTED
WELL THEN THE LIEUTENANT WENT ON WHAT PART OF THIS COMET OF OURS WILL BE THE PART TO COME INTO COLLISION WITH THE EARTH
IT IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER SINCE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING INCREDIBLE AS IT MIGHT APPEAR THE FACT WAS UNDENIABLE THAT THE SUN WAS RISING OVER THE SHELIF FROM THAT QUARTER OF THE HORIZON BEHIND WHICH IT USUALLY SANK FOR THE LATTER PORTION OF ITS DAILY ROUND
HAVING REFUSED TO QUIT THEIR POST THE ENGLISHMEN HAD VIRTUALLY EXCLUDED THEMSELVES FROM ANY FURTHER CONSIDERATION
IN ORDER THAT HE MAY ESCORT US THROUGH THE DEPTHS OF IMMEASURABLE SPACE SHOW US WHAT ASTRONOMY REALLY KNOWS OF CONDITIONS THERE AND UPON THE OTHER PLANETS VERNE ASKS US TO ACCEPT A SITUATION FRANKLY IMPOSSIBLE
THAT BELONGS TO A HIGHER POWER THAN OURS CHAPTER XIV
OTHERWISE SURELY IT WOULD NEVER HAVE ESCAPED OUR OBSERVATION HOWEVER SMALL IT MAY BE REPLIED SERVADAC WE MUST FIND IT
IT IS ALTOGETHER OUT OF THE QUESTION TO SUPPOSE THAT WE ARE NOT TO SEE MONTMARTRE AGAIN AND THE ORDERLY SHOOK HIS HEAD RESOLUTELY WITH THE AIR OF A MAN DETERMINED IN SPITE OF ARGUMENT TO ADHERE TO HIS OWN OPINION
HE HAD SOME TROUBLE TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS AND THE FIRST SOUNDS THAT ESCAPED HIS LIPS WERE THE CONCLUDING WORDS OF THE RONDO WHICH HAD BEEN SO RUTHLESSLY INTERRUPTED
ONE DAY AS HE WAS HURRYING DOWN TO HIS STUDY HE MET BEN ZOOF WHO SECRETLY ENTERTAINING A FEELING OF DELIGHT AT THE PROFESSOR'S MANIFEST DISCOMFITURE MADE SOME CASUAL REMARK ABOUT THINGS NOT BEING VERY STRAIGHT
WHETHER HE IMAGINED THAT THE COMPASSES WOULD BESTOW UPON HIS VERSES THE MEASURE OF A MATHEMATICAL ACCURACY OR WHETHER HE FANCIED THAT THE PARTI-COLORED LINES WOULD LEND VARIETY TO HIS RHYTHM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE
THE MEASUREMENT THUS OBTAINED WAS BY MEANS OF A PAIR OF COMPASSES DIVIDED ACCURATELY INTO TEN EQUAL PORTIONS OR DECIMETERS EACH OF COURSE 3.93 INCHES LONG
AND THOUGH HIMSELF INCLINED TO RECEIVE THESE PHENOMENA WITH PHILOSOPHIC INDIFFERENCE HIS NOTIONS OF MILITARY DUTY CAUSED HIS COUNTENANCE TO REFLECT THE CAPTAIN'S EXPRESSION OF AMAZEMENT
AND IF SO COULD HE EXPLAIN ITS MYSTERY
NEITHER SERVADAC NOR THE COUNT NOR LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WERE MEN TO BE EASILY DISHEARTENED BUT IT COULD NOT BE CONCEALED THAT THEY FELT THEMSELVES IN CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH THEY WERE EQUALLY HARASSED AND PERPLEXED
HOW THE AXIS BEING NEARLY PERPENDICULAR CAUSED THE DAYS AND NIGHTS TO BE NEARLY OF THE SAME LENGTH AND THE SEASONS TO BE INVARIABLE
THE FELLOW KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A GOOD BARGAIN SAID SERVADAC AS ISAAC AFTER CASTING A DISTRUSTFUL LOOK AROUND WENT OUT OF THE CABIN
AND WITH REQUICKENED ENERGIES THEY LABORED HARD AT PACKING ANXIOUS TO REACH THEIR GENIAL WINTER QUARTERS WITHOUT DELAY
UNLESS SOME VESTIGES OF THESE ARE FOUND I SHALL BEGIN TO SUSPECT THAT THE WHOLE OF AFRICA HAS BEEN SWALLOWED IN SOME VAST ABYSS ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE
THE COUNT HAS EVIDENTLY BEEN AND GONE BUT SUPPOSING THAT TO BE THE CASE PERSISTED THE CAPTAIN MY SECONDS WOULD HAVE WAITED AND NOT SEEING ME WOULD HAVE COME ON TOWARDS THE GOURBI
NOT ONLY DOES IT INVADE A REGION MORE REMOTE THAN EVEN THE TRIP TO THE MOON BUT THE AUTHOR HERE ABANDONS HIS USUAL SCRUPULOUSLY SCIENTIFIC ATTITUDE
ON THEIR ROAD THEY FAILED TO DISCERN A VESTIGE OF THE LITTLE TOWN OF MONTENOTTE
THE BREAKING UP OF THE FROZEN OCEAN WAS A MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE AND THE GREAT VOICE OF THE SEA AS THE WHALERS GRAPHICALLY DESCRIBE IT WAS HEARD IN ALL ITS SOLEMNITY
THAT WAS ENOUGH
BUT LET US GO ON AND COMPUTE THE MASS NO CAPTAIN THE DENSITY FIRST SAID ROSETTE
DEAD SIGHED SERVADAC
SURELY YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN HOW TO FIND THE VOLUME OF A SPHERE A MOMENT'S BREATHING TIME PLEASE BREATHING TIME INDEED
THIS WAS BY NO MEANS A DIFFICULT MATTER
HERE THE ELEVATION OF THE ICE HAD GONE ON INCREASING UNTIL THE SCHOONER AND THE TARTAN HAD BEEN UPLIFTED TO A HEIGHT OF 150 FEET NOT ONLY RENDERING THEM QUITE INACCESSIBLE BUT EXPOSING THEM TO ALL BUT CERTAIN DESTRUCTION IN THE EVENT OF A THAW
AND IF SO WAS IT IMPLIED THAT THE NAME OF THE COMET ITSELF WAS GALLIA AND WERE THEY MISTAKEN IN SUPPOSING THAT SUCH WAS THE NAME GIVEN BY THE SAVANT TO THE LITTLE WORLD THAT HAD BEEN SO SUDDENLY LAUNCHED INTO SPACE
BUT WHERE IS THAT WELL DEMANDED THE CAPTAIN
IF THE DEDUCTIONS OF MODERN SCIENCE BE TRUE THE SPEED OF THE COMET WHEN SUDDENLY CHECKED WILL BE TRANSMUTED INTO HEAT AND THAT HEAT WILL BE SO INTENSE THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE COMET WILL BE RAISED TO SOME MILLIONS OF DEGREES NO ONE HAVING ANYTHING DEFINITE TO ALLEGE IN REPLY TO LIEUTENANT PROCOPE'S FOREBODINGS THEY ALL RELAPSED INTO SILENCE
BALLOON INDEED LISTEN TO ME REPLIED PROCOPE
ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY EXPECTED THE CATASTROPHE COULD NOT FAIL TO CAUSE A SENSE OF GENERAL DEPRESSION
WHENCE CAME IT THAT A NEW BLAZING SPHEROID HITHERTO UNKNOWN TO ASTRONOMY NOW APPEARED SUDDENLY IN THE FIRMAMENT THOUGH IT WERE BUT TO LOSE ITSELF IMMEDIATELY BEHIND MASSES OF ACCUMULATED CLOUD
WE REMEMBER THAT WELL THEN CONTINUED THE PROFESSOR KEEP IT IN MIND FOR A FEW MINUTES NOW
OUT WITH IT SAID THE CAPTAIN
A DISCUSSION MORE THAN USUALLY ANIMATED AROSE BETWEEN THEM FOR THE TWO MEN WERE NOT ALTOGETHER OF THE SAME MIND AS TO THE MEASURES THAT OUGHT TO BE ADOPTED IN ORDER TO OPEN THE FAIREST CHANCE OF AVOIDING A FATAL CLIMAX TO THEIR EXPOSURE
HOW NOW
THE DEVASTATION GENTLEMEN SAID THE COUNT WHO PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THE FRENCHMAN'S IRRITATION EVERYWHERE WAS TERRIBLE AND COMPLETE
NOT THE MOON CRIED BEN ZOOF
BUT IT WAS TO BE APPREHENDED THAT UNLESS THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND SHOULD CHANGE THE RETURN WOULD BE A MATTER OF SOME DIFFICULTY
BUT THEY COULD DETECT NOTHING TO GUIDE THEM TO A DEFINITE DECISION
FORTUNATELY HIS DESIRES WERE VERY MODERATE
OF RIVALS HE WAS WELL AWARE HE HAD NOT A FEW AND AMONGST THESE NOT THE LEAST FORMIDABLE WAS THE RUSSIAN COUNT TIMASCHEFF
THAT WAS CLEAR
THEN GET ME MY COFFEE AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT BEN ZOOF LEFT TO GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND SERVADAC APPROACHED THE PROFESSOR IN ORDER TO ASSIST HIM IN RISING TO A SITTING POSTURE
NOT ONLY WAS ALGERIA LOST BUT THERE WAS NO TRACE OF TUNIS EXCEPT ONE SOLITARY ROCK WHICH WAS CROWNED BY AN ANCIENT TOMB OF ONE OF THE KINGS OF FRANCE LOUIS THE NINTH I PRESUME OBSERVED THE COLONEL
THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR COUNT TIMASCHEFF AND HAVING POURED OUT A TORRENT OF ANGRY INVECTIVE AGAINST THE ENGLISH OFFICERS HE ORDERED HIS CREW TO EMBARK IMMEDIATELY
WHAT A STRANGE PHENOMENON EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN
SUCH WAS THE END OF THE NEW YEAR'S DAY SO HAPPILY BEGUN
BUT NEITHER COLD NOR FATIGUE DETERRED THEM AND THEY WERE RESOLVED TO PERSEVERE
BURIED THUS NEARLY 900 FEET BELOW GROUND THE GALLIANS OUGHT TO HAVE HAD UNBOUNDED MENTAL ENERGY TO FURNISH AN ADEQUATE REACTION TO THE DEPRESSING MONOTONY OF THEIR EXISTENCE
WHO COULD EXPECT OTHERWISE THAN THAT WITH THE PROSPECT BEFORE HIM OF VIEWING THE GIANT AMONG PLANETS TEN TIMES NEARER THAN ANY MORTAL EYE HAD EVER DONE HE SHOULD HAVE BEGRUDGED EVERY MOMENT THAT DISTRACTED HIS ATTENTION
WHATEVER IT IS IN ANOTHER HOUR WE SHALL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT SAID SERVADAC
IT WAS NOT HAKKABUT'S HABIT EVER TO ADVANCE A LOAN EXCEPT AT AN EXTRAVAGANT RATE OF INTEREST OR WITHOUT DEMANDING FAR MORE THAN AN ADEQUATE SECURITY
BUT AS THE AERONAUTS WERE BEING HURRIED ON AT A SPEED OF 70 MILES A SECOND THIS VAGUE ASPECT OF THE EARTH SOON DEVELOPED ITSELF INTO DEFINITE OUTLINES
THE RUSSIANS WERE QUITE AT HOME AT OCCUPATION OF THIS SORT AND HAVING INITIATED THE SPANIARDS INTO ITS MYSTERIES THE TASK OF JOINING TOGETHER THE CASING WAS SOON COMPLETE
AND THE ONLY REPLY HE MADE TO THE RECITAL OF THIS NOVEL THEORY WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT IF IT WERE TRUE HE WOULD PREFER BEING CAPTURED BY MERCURY THAN BY JUPITER FOR MERCURY BEING SO MUCH THE YOUNGER WOULD PROBABLY PROVE THE LESS IMPERATIVE AND SELF-WILLED MASTER
HOW CHANGED THE CONDITION OF THINGS
ARE YOU SURE INQUIRED HAKKABUT PEERING DOWN CLOSE TO THE DIAL
HE UNDERSTOOD WELL ENOUGH THE CAUSE OF THE PHENOMENON BUT HE WAS OVERPOWERED BY THE CONVICTION THAT THE CURSED GENTILES WANTED TO CHEAT HIM
HE VOWED THAT THEY SHOULD BE SUED AND MADE TO PAY HIM DAMAGES
WE HAVE RECEIVED NO GOVERNMENT ORDERS TO THAT EFFECT
HAD HE ESTABLISHED ANY DATA FROM WHICH IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO RECKON WHAT TIME MUST ELAPSE BEFORE SHE WOULD AGAIN APPROACH THE EARTH
I AM AFRAID SO SAID ROSETTE
BUT THERE SEEMED NO HOPE
SIRIUS IN CANIS MAJOR 123 MILLIONS OF MILLIONS
THE CONTRAST TO THE ORDINARY ASPECT OF POLAR SEAS WAS VERY REMARKABLE
VERY SCARCE YOU KNOW
OH YES
IT BAFFLES OUR INVESTIGATIONS IN EVERY WAY AH NEVER MIND
STAY WHERE WE ARE FOR THE PRESENT
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO FOR A CASING I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT
THE CURVE WAS DIVIDED INTO TWENTY-FOUR SECTIONS OF UNEQUAL LENGTH REPRESENTING RESPECTIVELY THE DISTANCE DESCRIBED IN THE TWENTY-FOUR MONTHS OF THE GALLIAN YEAR THE TWELVE FORMER DIVISIONS ACCORDING TO KEPLER'S LAW GRADUALLY DIMINISHING IN LENGTH AS THEY APPROACHED THE POINT DENOTING THE APHELION AND INCREASING AS THEY NEARED THE PERIHELION
FROM THIS HOLE PROJECTED THE CASE OF AN ASTRONOMER'S TELESCOPE
CHEMIN PARCOURU DU 1ER MARS AU 1ER AVRIL
BETTER THAN THAT CRIED OUT THE PROFESSOR TRIUMPHANTLY
AND VERY SOON BY THE AID OF THE GLASS IT COULD BE ASCERTAINED THAT SHE WAS A SCHOONER-YACHT AND MAKING STRAIGHT FOR THE ISLAND
WHEN DID YOU EVER KNOW SPANIARDS LIKE THEM TO HAVE LOTS OF MONEY BUT I HAVE SEEN IT MYSELF SAID BEN ZOOF
AFTER ALL THEY SAID THEY SHOULD HARDLY BE MUCH WORSE OFF THAN THOUSANDS WHO ANNUALLY WINTER IN ARCTIC REGIONS
TRASH CRIED BEN ZOOF
NOBODY EXPECTS US SAID SERVADAC
THE THREE TOGETHER QUITTED THE MOSQUE AND DESCENDED THE ROCK TO THE SHORE WHENCE THEIR BOAT RE-CONVEYED THEM TO THE SCHOONER WHICH WAS SOON AGAIN ON HER SOUTHWARD VOYAGE
TO CROWN ALL MONTMARTRE BOASTED A MOUNTAIN--A VERITABLE MOUNTAIN
IT WAS ACTUALLY AN ISLAND
THAT IS VERY CERTAIN NO INDEED ANSWERED BEN ZOOF WITH A SIGH
IT SEEMS TO ME CAPTAIN THAT YOU HAVE TURNED INTO ROBINSON CRUSOE AND THAT I AM YOUR MAN FRIDAY
NO CATHEDRAL--NOT EVEN BURGOS ITSELF--COULD VIE WITH THE CHURCH AT MONTMARTRE
ACCORDINGLY LEAVING PARIS FOR THE BALEARIC ISLES HE PLACED HIS OBSERVATORY ON THE HIGHEST POINT OF FORMENTERA AND ACCOMPANIED AS HE WAS ONLY BY HIS SERVANT JOSEPH LED THE LIFE OF A RECLUSE
FORTY-TWO MINUTES PAST SAID THE LIEUTENANT AND HIS VOICE SEEMED TO THRILL THROUGH THE SILENCE OF EXPECTATION
HUSH HUSH
NO ISTHMUS EXISTED TO FORM A CONNECTING LINK WITH THE TERRITORY OF TENES WHICH HAD ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED
AT PRESENT WE HAVE NOT HEARD A WORD FROM HIS LIPS THE JEW LOOKED PERPLEXED
VERY GOOD MY BRAVE FELLOW REPLIED SERVADAC HOPE ON HOPE WHILE YOU MAY
HE IS A SHREWD FELLOW AND WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT BUT WILL HE PROTECT MY PROPERTY POOR ISAAC WOULD ASK TREMULOUSLY
OH PARDON ME INTERPOSED BEN ZOOF YOU ARE MISTAKING THE STATE OF THE CASE ALTOGETHER
THEY HAD NO FEAR OF STARVATION
PABLO WAS SOON BACK BRINGING NO ANSWER EXCEPT THAT THE PROFESSOR HAD TOLD HIM THAT TO-DAY WAS THE 125TH OF JUNE AND THAT TO-MORROW WOULD BE THE 1ST OF JULY CONSEQUENTLY SERVADAC AND THE COUNT TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT PALMYRIN ROSETTE DECLINED THEIR INVITATION
THE BELTS ALL PARALLEL TO JUPITER'S EQUATOR WERE VERY DISTINCT IN THEIR MARKINGS
THE FESTIVAL WAS OBSERVED WITH A SOLEMNITY STILL MORE MARKED THAN THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE PRECEDING YEAR
COME SAID SERVADAC
WITH THE OVER-CLOUDING OF THE HEAVENS THERE AROSE A VIOLENT TEMPEST
I SEE IT QUITE DISTINCTLY AND HE WAS NOT MISTAKEN
HE WAS A MAN OF ABOUT FIFTY BUT FROM HIS APPEARANCE MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS OLDER
HOW IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE INHABITANTS OF THE LIVING TOMB TO SAY
THAT TELESCOPE SAID THE ORDERLY
I THOUGHT MAJOR THAT IT WAS NOT UNLIKELY YOU WERE IN IGNORANCE OF THE FACT THAT BOTH CEUTA AND GIBRALTAR HAVE BEEN TRAVERSING THE SOLAR REGIONS ON THE SURFACE OF A COMET THE MAJOR SMILED INCREDULOUSLY
ALL INTEREST THERE WAS TOO MUCH ABSORBED IN TERRESTRIAL MATTERS AND IN ASCERTAINING WHAT CHANGES HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE CONFIGURATION OF THE EARTH ITSELF TO PERMIT MUCH ATTENTION TO BE PAID TO ITS ERRATIC MOVEMENTS THROUGH SPACE
CHRONOMETER IN HAND LIEUTENANT PROCOPE STOOD MARKING THE MINUTES AND SECONDS AS THEY FLED
I HAVE JUST THOUGHT OF THE END OF MY RONDO AND IN A VOICE OF INSPIRATION ACCOMPANYING HIS WORDS WITH DRAMATIC GESTURES SERVADAC BEGAN TO DECLAIM
BEFORE THE SHOCK SIR ANSWERED THE PROFESSOR I HAD CONCLUSIVELY DEMONSTRATED THE PATH OF THE COMET
COME COME OLD CAIAPHAS DO YOU HEAR
I MUST HAVE MONEY HE SAID
FIRST OF ALL RESUMED THE LIEUTENANT WE WILL SPECIFY THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THE SHOCK MAY HAPPEN AND THE PRIME FACT TO BE REMEMBERED INTERPOSED SERVADAC IS THAT THE COMBINED VELOCITY OF THE TWO BODIES WILL BE ABOUT 21,000 MILES AN HOUR EXPRESS SPEED AND NO MISTAKE MUTTERED BEN ZOOF
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND HOWEVER SAID ROSETTE THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS TO BE MADE
THE MAJOR QUITE CONCURRED
WE WILL BE YOUR FRIENDS
WE ARE ONLY CONTEMPLATING ABOUT AN HOUR'S JOURNEY AH A FIRE-BALLOON
NOW HAKKABUT STOP THESE MISERABLE LAMENTATIONS OF YOURS ONCE FOR ALL
AND THERE WAS EVERY REASON TO CONJECTURE THAT SO IT WAS
JUST ABOUT 5,000 TIMES LESS THAN THE EARTH OBSERVED THE LIEUTENANT
EXCEPT THAT THE CLOUDS OF ICE-DUST RAISED BY THE METAL RUNNERS WERE AN EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAD NOT ACTUALLY LEFT THE LEVEL SURFACE OF THE ICE THE CAPTAIN AND LIEUTENANT MIGHT AGAIN AND AGAIN HAVE IMAGINED THAT THEY WERE BEING CONVEYED THROUGH THE AIR IN A BALLOON
THEY ALL RECEIVED CAPTAIN SERVADAC WHOM BEN ZOOF INTRODUCED AS THE GOVERNOR GENERAL WITH DUE RESPECT AND RETURNED QUICKLY TO THEIR SEPARATE TASKS
IT WAS INDEED NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN THAT PERCHANCE UPON SOME REMOTE AND UNDISCOVERED ISLE THERE MIGHT BE THE SOLITARY WRITER OF THE MYSTERIOUS PAPERS WHICH THEY HAD FOUND AND IF SO THAT WOULD RAISE THE CENSUS OF THEIR NEW ASTEROID TO AN AGGREGATE OF THIRTY-SIX
IT SEEMED AT PRESENT OUT OF THEIR POWER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE LAND UPON WHICH THEY WERE SO HAPPILY SETTLED WAS AN ISLAND OR A CONTINENT AND TILL THE COLD WAS ABATED THEY FEARED TO UNDERTAKE ANY LENGTHENED EXPEDITION TO ASCERTAIN THE ACTUAL EXTENT OF THE STRANGE CONCRETE OF METALLIC CRYSTALLIZATION
GOOD HEAVENS CRIED BEN ZOOF THAT LEAP MUST HAVE BEEN THIRTY FEET AT LEAST TRUE ENOUGH REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
DON'T YOU SEE THE SUN IS IN THE WEST
THE MINIMUM DISTANCE OF SATURN WOULD NOT BE LESS THAN 415,000,000 MILES
PERHAPS SOME DAY WE MAY HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING REGISTERED AMONG THE MINOR PLANETS NO CHANCE OF THAT QUICKLY REJOINED LIEUTENANT PROCOPE
3
NO NO
SIX DEGREES SAID SERVADAC
A SUDDEN REVELATION DASHED ACROSS SERVADAC'S MIND
BUT STANDING OUT HERE WILL NEVER DO
WHENCE CAME IT THAT IN THE SPACE OF A FEW SECONDS THE MOON'S DISC REACHED A MAGNITUDE AS THOUGH IT WERE BUT A TENTH PART OF ITS ORDINARY DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH
THE 1ST OF JANUARY WAS DRAWING NEAR THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE SHOCK WHICH HAD RESULTED IN THE SEVERANCE OF THIRTY-SIX HUMAN BEINGS FROM THE SOCIETY OF THEIR FELLOW-MEN
UPON THE GENERAL SUBSTRATUM RESTED A MASSIVE CONGLOMERATE THE CRYSTALLIZATIONS OF WHICH ROSE LIKE A FOREST OF GIGANTIC PYRAMIDS AND OBELISKS
THE SURFACE OF THE ICE DID NOT AS A LIQUID SEA WOULD REFLECT THE LAST GREEN RAY OF LIGHT
IS IT YOU I MYSELF SAID THE CAPTAIN
AT FIRST HE PROFESSED TO REGARD THE PROPOSED REMOVAL INTO WINTER-QUARTERS AS AN ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE UPON HIS CREDULITY
NO STINT OF FUEL
THE PROFESSOR STAMPED WITH VEXATION
UNCOMFORTABLE AS WAS THEIR TEMPORARY ABODE SERVADAC AND HIS ATTENDANT MADE NO COMPLAINTS
THERE WERE WILD DUCKS IN THOUSANDS
DIAMETER 450
THE CAPTAIN KEPT HIS THERMOMETER CLOSE AT HAND WHERE HE COULD REPEATEDLY CONSULT IT AND ON THE 15TH HE FOUND THAT IT REGISTERED 50 DEGREES CENTIGRADE IN THE SHADE
A FEW WORDS SEEMED TO ESCAPE HIS LIPS BUT THEY WERE QUITE UNINTELLIGIBLE
CORPORAL PIM MUST BE SENT FOR
ONCE UPON THE ICE EVERYONE FOLLOWED HIS OWN FANCY AND SOME SINGLY SOME IN GROUPS SCATTERED THEMSELVES IN ALL DIRECTIONS
LOVER LOVING HONESTLY OFFER I MYSELF TO THEE BEYOND THIS HOWEVER THE CAPTAIN'S POETICAL GENIUS WAS IMPOTENT TO CARRY HIM
BUT EVEN THIS DISTANCE ALTHOUGH TOO GREAT TO AFFECT THE COMET'S PROGRESS MORE THAN HAD BEEN DULY RECKONED ON WAS CONSIDERABLY SHORTER THAN WHAT HAD EVER SEPARATED SATURN FROM THE EARTH
SIMULTANEOUSLY THE TWO TELESCOPES WERE LOWERED
TO HAVE ASCERTAINED THAT THE POLE-STAR HAD BECOME DISPLACED WOULD HAVE BEEN AN UNDENIABLE PROOF THAT THE EARTH WAS REVOLVING ON A NEW AXIS
ADDING IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THESE SPANIARDS ARE SO IGNORANT AS NOT TO HAVE NOTICED THE CHANGE IN THE LENGTH OF THE DAYS
HE PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS EYES AS IF TO DISPEL A MIST AND STOOD WITH A FIXED GAZE CENTERED ON A POINT TOWARDS THE SOUTH
BUT STOPPED SHORT AND SAID HOWEVER THOSE THINGS NEVER HAPPENED SIR DID THEY HIS MASTER COULD ONLY REPLY CONFOUND IT BEN ZOOF
BEN ZOOF MADE THE SLEEPING ACCOMMODATION AS COMFORTABLE AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD ALLOW
I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD REPLIED MAJOR OLIPHANT LOOKING INTENTLY AT THE CHESS-BOARD
AND SINCE MEAT COULD BE PRESERVED FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME IN THE ORIGINAL STORE-PLACES NOW COLDER THAN EVER THE EXPEDIENT OF KILLING THE ANIMALS SEEMED TO RECOMMEND ITSELF AS EQUALLY PRUDENT AND HUMANE
MOSTAGANEM REJOICED IN A WELL-SHELTERED HARBOR WHICH ENABLED HER TO UTILIZE ALL THE RICH PRODUCTS OF THE MINA AND THE LOWER SHELIF
HOW THE DOBRYNA HAD MADE HER VOYAGE
BUT SERVADAC CUT HIM SHORT
MY CONJECTURE IS SAID PROCOPE THAT A FRAGMENT OF CONSIDERABLE MAGNITUDE HAS BEEN DETACHED FROM THE EARTH
BECAUSE THERE IS A SMALL SATELLITE IN ATTENDANCE AND THE CAPTAIN DREW HIS SERVANT'S ATTENTION TO A BRIGHT SPECK APPARENTLY ABOUT THE SIZE OF ONE OF JUPITER'S SATELLITES SEEN THROUGH A MODERATE TELESCOPE THAT WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE JUST WITHIN THE FOCUS OF HIS GLASS
NO DOUBT THE GOVERNOR GENERAL WILL BE ANXIOUS TO INVESTIGATE THE FULL EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE AND WILL SEND A VESSEL FROM ALGIERS TO EXPLORE
IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE IT IS NOT ALONE THE COUNT AGREED
WANTED
THE WHOLE JOURNEY THERE AND BACK MIGHT BE PERFORMED IN EIGHT DAYS
THE WINES PART OF THE DOBRYNA'S STORES WERE OF EXCELLENT QUALITY
THE VOLCANO TO ITS VERY SUMMIT AND THE SURROUNDING ROCKS WERE STILL COVERED WITH THE UNSULLIED MANTLE OF SNOW THAT HAD FALLEN WHILE THE ATMOSPHERE WAS STILL TO SOME EXTENT CHARGED WITH VAPOR
SCRAPS OF FOOD WERE THROWN TO THEM FROM THE GALLERIES
ADDING WITH A STATELY EMPHASIS BUT WE SHALL BE SURE TO HAVE TIDINGS FROM ENGLAND BEFORE LONG WHETHER ENGLAND IS STILL IN EXISTENCE OR NOT I SUPPOSE SAID SERVADAC IN A TONE OF IRONY
THEREFORE IT WAS WELL THAT THEY MADE A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY AND RESIGNED THEMSELVES TO PATIENT EXPECTATION OF THE BRITISH SHIP WHICH IN DUE TIME WOULD BRING RELIEF
AS THE PITCHING HOWEVER WAS THE RESULT OF A LONG UNIFORM SWELL THE YACHT DID NOT LABOR MUCH HARDER THAN SHE WOULD AGAINST THE ORDINARY SHORT STRONG WAVES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
THE SOLE EXPEDIENT THAT THEIR UNITED COUNSEL COULD SUGGEST WAS TO OBTAIN A REFUGE BELOW GROUND AND THAT WAS DENIED THEM BY THE STRANGE AND IMPENETRABLE SUBSTRATUM OF THE SOIL
IT IS VERY LITTLE
AS THE RESULT OF HIS COGITATIONS HE OCCASIONALLY LEFT HIS TARTAN AND MADE A VISIT TO THE SHORE
THE TIME COULD NOT BE FAR DISTANT WHEN SHIPS SIDES AND ORDINARY WALLS WOULD FAIL TO GIVE AN ADEQUATE PROTECTION FROM THE SEVERITY OF THE COLD THAT MUST BE EXPECTED
COLONEL MURPHY SLIGHTLY SMILED
IN AN HOUR AND A HALF THEY REACHED THE GOURBI
AND ON BOARD SHIP THE ENTIRE HOLD AND IN FORTS A SINGLE FLOOR IS APPROPRIATED TO THIS PURPOSE
THE SHOCK CAME AND WITH IT THE RESULTS ALREADY RECORDED
A SOFT AND DELICIOUS HERBAGE CARPETED THE SOIL WHILST TREES FORMED A CHARMING FRAMEWORK TO THE WHOLE
IN AN INSTANT THE LIEUTENANT HAD SEIZED HIS TELESCOPE
THE LID WAS FASTENED ON BY WAX AND SO SECURELY THAT IT WOULD TAKE A LONG IMMERSION BEFORE ANY WATER COULD PENETRATE
A VIBRATION QUIVERED THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE
THE DOBRYNA APPROACHED THE LAND AS NEARLY AS WAS PRUDENT THE BOAT WAS LOWERED AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE COUNT AND SERVADAC HAD LANDED UPON THE ISLET WHICH WAS A MERE PLOT OF MEADOW LAND NOT MUCH MORE THAN TWO ACRES IN EXTENT DOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH A FEW MYRTLE-BUSHES AND LENTISKS INTERSPERSED WITH SOME ANCIENT OLIVES
FROM COMPANIONS IN PERIL WOULD THEY NOT AGAIN BE AVOWED RIVALS
THEY WERE UTTERLY BEWILDERED
ALL NIGHT LONG BEN ZOOF WOULD NOT LEAVE THE PROFESSOR'S BEDSIDE
THE MONTGOLFIER ELONGATED TO ITS UTMOST STRETCH WAS MANIFESTLY BEING SUCKED INTO A VORTEX
ON THE OTHER HE KNEW THAT A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY IN ENGLISH AND RUSSIAN COINAGE WAS IN THE POSSESSION OF VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE LITTLE COLONY AND THIS ALTHOUGH VALUELESS NOW WOULD BE WORTH AS MUCH AS EVER IF THE PROPER CONDITION OF THINGS SHOULD BE RESTORED
IN THE NAME OF PEACE WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WITH YOURSELF YOU WOULD NEVER BELIEVE ME COLONEL ANSWERED SERVADAC IF I WERE TO TELL YOU
BUT TOIL AS THEY MIGHT AT THE ACCUMULATION OF FIREWOOD CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND HIS COMPANIONS COULD NOT RESIST THE CONVICTION THAT THE CONSUMPTION OF A VERY SHORT PERIOD WOULD EXHAUST THE TOTAL STOCK
THAT CONFOUNDED STEELYARD
THE STOVE WAS READY FOR USE THE COPPER SKILLET WAS AS BRIGHT AS HANDS COULD MAKE IT AND THE BEADS OF CONDENSED STEAM UPON THE SURFACE OF A LARGE STONE AL-CARAZA GAVE EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS SUPPLIED WITH WATER
EAGERLY AND ANXIOUSLY DID THEY LOOK AROUND
THERE WAS NO SEMBLANCE OF A CREEK IN WHICH THE DOBRYNA COULD FIND AN ANCHORAGE
LESS THAN IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
AT A SIGN FROM SERVADAC AN ORDERLY WHO HAD BEEN STANDING AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE LED FORWARD A MAGNIFICENT ARABIAN HORSE
THOUGH IT COULD NOT ANYHOW HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH SMALLER HE ADDED LOOKING SLYLY AT THE PROFESSOR
WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT A SINGLE HUMAN BEING COULD HAVE SURVIVED THE CONVULSION
YES QUITE TRUE WHERE FROM FROM THE BALEARIC ISLES THE BALEARIC ISLES ECHOED ISAAC
NOW NONE OF THAT
IT HAPPENED THAT THE MOON WAS NEW ON THAT VERY DAY
THE DEPARTURE WAS FIXED FOR THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE 2ND OF NOVEMBER
IDIOT EXCLAIMED ROSETTE
NERINA WAS A PLANET THEN
LET US MAKE HASTE AND WARM OURSELVES INSPIRED BY HIS CONFIDENCE THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT ADVANCED BRAVELY ALONG THE UNSEEN AND WINDING PATH
AND THIRDLY YOUR EXPEDITION WILL BE OF SMALL AVAIL UNLESS YOU CONVEY PROVISIONS NOT ONLY FOR YOURSELVES BUT FOR THOSE WHOM YOU HOPE TO RELIEVE WE CAN CARRY OUR OWN PROVISIONS ON OUR BACKS IN KNAPSACKS INTERPOSED SERVADAC QUICKLY UNWILLING TO RECOGNIZE ANY DIFFICULTY IN THE WAY
HERE IS MY CARD AND MINE THIS RAPID ALTERCATION WAS THUS BROUGHT TO AN END BY THE FORMAL INTERCHANGE OF THE NAMES OF THE DISPUTANTS
THE COUNT THE CAPTAIN THE LIEUTENANT EVERYBODY HURRIED TO THE FORECASTLE
HAD HE NOTICED EVER SINCE THE 1ST OF JANUARY THAT THE SUN HAD RISEN IN THE WEST
A DOUBLE DISASTER WAS THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE THAW
THEY WERE ONLY 31,000,000 MILES APART
WHAT MATTERS WHETHER IT BE SPANISH OR ITALIAN
BEN ZOOF SADDLED THE HORSES AND FILLED HIS POUCH WITH BISCUITS AND GAME
AND THEY ACCORDINGLY GUESSED THAT PROFESSOR ROSETTE HAD CONCEIVED THE PLAN OF PLACING SUCH A NUMBER OF THESE COINS IN JUXTAPOSITION THAT THE LENGTH OF THEIR UNITED DIAMETERS SHOULD MEASURE EXACTLY THE THOUSAND MILLIMETERS THAT MAKE UP THE TERRESTRIAL METER
THERE IS NO OTHER BALANCE HERE AND AS THE JEW SPOKE THE PROFESSOR FANCIED HE COULD DETECT THE FAINTEST OF SIGHS
HAKKABUT PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO CREDIT THE REAL SITUATION
IT ALL SEEMED SO RECENT IN ITS FORMATION THAT THE ATMOSPHERE HAD HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF PRODUCING ITS WONTED EFFECT IN SOFTENING THE HARDNESS OF ITS LINES IN ROUNDING THE SHARPNESS OF ITS ANGLES OR IN MODIFYING THE COLOR OF ITS SURFACE
HE REMEMBERED ALSO THAT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE PROMONTORY THERE WAS A ROCKY HEADLAND CROWNED WITH SMOKE
FOR A FROWNING HEADLAND STOOD OUT FAR INTO THE BASIN OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND FORMED A PROMONTORY STRETCHING OUT BEYOND THE PROPER PLACES OF THE BALEARIC ISLES
HOW IS IT THAT THESE SHOULD ALL BE CHANGED INTO A MINERAL CONCRETE WITH WHICH WE HAVE NO ACQUAINTANCE NO DOUBT IT WAS A SERIOUS OBJECTION
ANYHOW THEY WERE FIRMER AND MORE CONFIDING FRIENDS THAN EVER
DEPEND UPON IT CAPTAIN YOU ARE MISTAKEN REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT
SINCE NONE OF YOU GENTLEMEN AT THE TIME OF THE SHOCK TOOK THE PRECAUTION TO SAVE EITHER A METER MEASURE OR A KILOGRAMME WEIGHT FROM THE EARTH AND SINCE BOTH THESE ARTICLES ARE NECESSARY FOR THE CALCULATION ON WHICH WE ARE ENGAGED I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DEVISE MEANS OF MY OWN TO REPLACE THEM THIS EXORDIUM DELIVERED HE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO WATCH ITS EFFECT UPON HIS AUDIENCE WHO HOWEVER WERE TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE PROFESSOR'S TEMPER TO MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO EXONERATE THEMSELVES FROM THE REBUKE OF CARELESSNESS AND SUBMITTED SILENTLY TO THE IMPLIED REPROACH
PALMYRIN ROSETTE WAS IN A FURIOUS RAGE
HE WAS THE MOST MISERABLE OF MORTALS
THE LOSS OF HIS TELESCOPE HAD DOUBTLESS A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH HIS ILL-HUMOR
WAS IT NOT ONLY TOO LIKELY THAT IN THE FUSION OF THE TWO ATMOSPHERES THE BALLOON ITSELF IN WHICH THEY WERE BEING CONVEYED WOULD BE RENT INTO RIBBONS AND EVERY ONE OF ITS PASSENGERS HURLED INTO DESTRUCTION SO THAT NOT A GALLIAN SHOULD SURVIVE TO TELL THE TALE OF THEIR STRANGE PEREGRINATIONS
I WISH WE HAD A SLEDGE SAID BEN ZOOF
GALLIA THEN HAS SOME INTERNAL HEAT SAID SERVADAC
GALLIA WAS NEITHER TO PASS BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM NOR TO TRAVEL OUT OF SIGHT OF THE TERRESTRIAL SPHERE
TO THE SOUTH--IF SOUTH IN THIS INVERTED ORDER OF THINGS IT MIGHT STILL BE CALLED--THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY ALSO APPEARED UNALTERED AND SOME LEAGUES AWAY THE PEAKS OF THE MERDEYAH MOUNTAINS STILL RETAINED THEIR ACCUSTOMED OUTLINE
IT WAS ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK
ABOVE THE CAVERN 130 FEET UP THE MOUNTAIN WAS A DARK HOLE ABOVE WHICH THE STREAM OF LAVA MADE A BIFURCATION IN ITS COURSE
ADDRESSING THE CAPTAIN HE SAID NOW SERVADAC TAKE YOUR PAPER AND A PEN AND FIND ME THE SURFACE OF GALLIA WITH MORE SUBMISSION THAN WHEN HE WAS A SCHOOL-BOY THE CAPTAIN SAT DOWN AND ENDEAVORED TO RECALL THE PROPER FORMULA
DO YOU MEAN THE OBSERVATORY YES THE OBSERVATORY
ON THE 15TH SIX DAYS AGO SOMEONE WAS ALIVE TO WRITE IT YES
AND NOW CONTINUED SERVADAC WE WILL TAKE THE SHORTEST WAY BACK TO THE GOURBI AND SEE WHAT OUR HORSES THINK ABOUT IT ALL THEY WILL THINK THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE GROOMED SAID THE ORDERLY
THEN ADDRESSING COUNT TIMASCHEFF HE ADDED ALTOGETHER I THINK THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE ARE FAIRLY REPRESENTED BY THE POPULATION OF GALLIA TRUE CAPTAIN ANSWERED THE COUNT
THE PROFESSOR BY WAY OF RETALIATION HAD COMMENCED SNEERING AT THE PRODIGIOUS MOUNTAIN OF MONTMARTRE AND THE DISPUTE WAS BEGINNING TO LOOK SERIOUS WHEN SERVADAC ENTERED
IS IT NOT AS CLEAR AS DAYLIGHT THAT THE EARTH AND THIS COMET HAVE BEEN IN COLLISION AND THE RESULT HAS BEEN THAT OUR LITTLE WORLD HAS BEEN SPLIT OFF AND SENT FLYING FAR INTO SPACE COUNT TIMASCHEFF AND THE LIEUTENANT LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN SILENCE
I DID NOT SAY GALLIA REPLIED ROSETTE STAMPING HIS FOOT IMPETUOUSLY
NOT LIKELY REPLIED THE COUNT
THIS RONDO IT IS UNNECESSARY TO CONCEAL WAS TO BE AN ODE ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG WIDOW BY WHOM HE HAD BEEN CAPTIVATED AND WHOM HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MARRY AND THE TENOR OF HIS MUSE WAS INTENDED TO PROVE THAT WHEN ONCE A MAN HAS FOUND AN OBJECT IN ALL RESPECTS WORTHY OF HIS AFFECTIONS HE SHOULD LOVE HER IN ALL SIMPLICITY WHETHER THE APHORISM WERE UNIVERSALLY TRUE WAS NOT VERY MATERIAL TO THE GALLANT CAPTAIN WHOSE SOLE AMBITION AT PRESENT WAS TO CONSTRUCT A ROUNDELAY OF WHICH THIS SHOULD BE THE PREVAILING SENTIMENT
PERHAPS THE DEPTHS MIGHT DISCLOSE WHAT THE SURFACE FAILED TO REVEAL AND COUNT TIMASCHEFF ANXIOUS THAT SERVADAC SHOULD HAVE EVERY FACILITY AFFORDED HIM FOR SOLVING HIS DOUBTS CALLED FOR THE SOUNDING-LINE
THE HIGHEST POINTS WERE QUITE INVISIBLE
ALTHOUGH THE ORBIT OF THE EARTH WAS UNALTERED CONTINUED THE PROFESSOR THE RESULT OF THE COLLISION WAS THE PROJECTION OF THE COMET INTO A NEW ORBIT ALTOGETHER AND MAY I ASK SAID PROCOPE DEFERENTIALLY WHETHER YOU HAVE GOT THE ELEMENTS OF THE FRESH ORBIT YES THEN PERHAPS YOU KNOW I KNOW THIS SIR THAT AT 47 MINUTES 35.6 SECONDS AFTER TWO O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THE 1ST OF JANUARY LAST GALLIA IN PASSING ITS ASCENDING NODE CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE EARTH
OF COURSE A YEAR MUST HAVE TWELVE MONTHS OF COURSE SAID THE CAPTAIN
PROOF AGAINST ALL INTERRUPTION COUNT TIMASCHEFF AS IF HE HAD NOT HEARD IT WENT ON WITHOUT PAUSING
NEITHER SHOUTING NOR KNOCKING COULD DRAW FORTH A REPLY
AND RUSSIANS AND SPANIARDS DAY AFTER DAY MIGHT BE SEEN GATHERED ROUND THE LARGE TABLE GIVING THEIR BEST ATTENTION TO INSTRUCTION WHICH SHOULD SEND THEM BACK TO MOTHER EARTH LESS IGNORANT THAN THEY HAD LEFT HER
IT HAD NO OUTLYING REEFS A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SEEMED TO SUGGEST THE PROBABILITY THAT IN THE RECENT CONVULSION IT HAD SUNK GRADUALLY UNTIL IT HAD REACHED ITS PRESENT POSITION OF EQUILIBRIUM
CONFOUND THE FELLOW
A TELESCOPE-CASE WOULD PROBABLY BE THE PROPERTY OF SOME ONE ON BOARD A SHIP
THE TOMB OF ST LOUIS HE EXCLAIMED AND HIS COMPANIONS INVOLUNTARILY FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE AND MADE A REVERENTIAL OBEISANCE TO THE VENERATED MONUMENT
MARS HAS EXISTED FOR 1,000,000,000 YEARS AT A DISTANCE OF 139,212,000 MILES
AND COMMON SENSE DICTATED THAT THEY WERE BOUND TO DIRECT ALL THEIR ENERGIES TO INSURE THAT THEIR ASTEROID SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A UNITED AND SYMPATHIZING POPULATION
AN HOUR LATER AND THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF TWENTY-TWO HAD MET IN THE CHAMBER ADJOINING THE GOURBI
COMPARE THESE CALCULATIONS WITH THE MAP AND IT IS AT ONCE APPARENT THAT THE NORTHERNMOST LIMIT BARELY TOUCHED THE COAST OF PROVENCE WHILE THE SOUTHERNMOST REACHED TO ABOUT LAT
HAVING ROUNDED THE GREAT PROMONTORY THAT HAD BARRED HER FARTHER PROGRESS TO THE NORTH THE SCHOONER SKIRTED ITS UPPER EDGE
HOW OFTEN AM I TO TELL YOU THAT ALGIERS IS NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE
ON THE 26TH UNDER AN ATMOSPHERE PERFECTLY CLEAR AND DRY THE THERMOMETER FELL TO 12 DEGREES F
OH FOR SOME WINGS OR ELSE A BALLOON CRIED SERVADAC AS HE GAZED AROUND HIM
HA LAUGHED BEN ZOOF ALOUD
YES FRANCE IS THERE COME COUNT COME
IT ONLY AWAITED THE STOWAGE OF THE PASSENGERS
AND AS THEIR RETURN TO THE EARTH APPEARED TO THEM TO BECOME MORE AND MORE DUBIOUS THEY ABANDONED THEIR VIEWS OF NARROW ISOLATION AND TRIED TO EMBRACE THE WIDER PHILOSOPHY THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THE CREDIBILITY OF A HABITABLE UNIVERSE
NO NO BEN ZOOF ANSWERED SERVADAC
ITS BEAMS BEING ALL BUT DESTITUTE OF THEIR PROPER WARMTH AND RADIANCE
WOULD NOT THE LAVA-CINDERS EXHUMED FROM THE EXTINCT VOLCANO BE THEIR LAST POOR RESOURCE
TELESCOPES WERE BROUGHT AND IT WAS VERY SOON ASCERTAINED BEYOND A QUESTION THAT THE NEW LUMINARY WAS NOT THE WELL-KNOWN PHOEBE OF TERRESTRIAL NIGHTS
IF THE LAST IT WOULD BE SURE SOONER OR LATER AFTER SOME PERIODIC INTERVAL TO RETURN
AND THE SUM OF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF THESE TWO SUBSTANCES IS 10 PRECISELY THE NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS GALLIA'S DENSITY A COMET OF GOLD EJACULATED THE CAPTAIN
AS FAR AS THEY HAD ASCERTAINED EXCEPT GOURBI ISLAND THE SOLE SURVIVING FRAGMENTS OF THE OLD WORLD WERE FOUR SMALL ISLANDS
THE DEJEUNER OVER THERE STILL REMAINED THREE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT
IN TRUTH HIS CHARACTER OF STAFF-OFFICER WAS NOW ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN THAT OF GASCON POET
WE WILL CERTAINLY DO OUR BEST TO GET ON WITH HIM SAID THE COUNT
WHAT A SAVING OF EXPENSE IT WOULD BE EXCLAIMED BEN ZOOF IF EVERY HOUSEHOLD COULD BE FURNISHED WITH ITS OWN PRIVATE VOLCANO THE LARGE CAVERN AT THE GENERAL JUNCTION OF THE GALLERIES WAS FITTED UP AS A DRAWING-ROOM AND ARRANGED WITH ALL THE BEST FURNITURE BOTH OF THE GOURBI AND OF THE CABIN OF THE DOBRYNA
THEY HAD BEEN DEAD FOR AGES BEN ZOOF DID NOT ANSWER A WORD
CHAPTER XIV
WHAT THEN WAS THE CAPTAIN'S BEWILDERMENT WHEN AFTER HE HAD BEEN WALKING FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF HE NOTICED ON THE WESTERN HORIZON A STRONG GLARE THAT PENETRATED EVEN THE MASSES OF THE CLOUDS
THE SHORE WAS INDENTED WITH THE MARKS OF MANY FOOTSTEPS LEFT BY THE COLONISTS EITHER ON THEIR WAY TO COLLECT ICE FOR DRINKING PURPOSES OR AS THE RESULT OF THEIR SKATING EXPEDITIONS
IT IS TWENTY-TWO TWENTY-TWO EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN
BUT IF SUCH THERE HAD EVER BEEN HE MUST THEY CONCLUDED EITHER HAVE FLED OR HAVE PERISHED ON THAT EVENTFUL NIGHT
KEEP UP YOUR SPIRITS MY FRIENDS SAID SERVADAC
BUT IT WILL BE OUR FAULT OUR OWN LACK OF VIGILANCE IF WE ARE TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND SO THE CONVERSATION DROPPED
THE FIRST STEP WAS TO CLEAR THE CAVERN OF ITS ACCUMULATION OF ASHES AND THEN THE LABOR OF REMOVAL COMMENCED IN EARNEST
AT LEAST OF THE MANY BOOKS SINCE WRITTEN UPON THE SAME THEME AS VERNE'S NO ONE HAS YET SUCCEEDED IN EQUALING OR EVEN APPROACHING IT
NOT A MATERIAL OBJECT OF ANY KIND WAS TO BE NOTICED FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PASSENGERS IT WAS PROPOSED TO ERECT A KIND OF WOODEN ROOF LINED WITH STRONG CLOTH
VERY OFTEN TOO FOR PERIODS OF SEVERAL YEARS DAILY ECLIPSES OF THE SUN MUST OCCUR THROUGH THE INTERPOSITION OF THIS TRIPLE RING
THE OFFICERS WERE SPEECHLESS WITH ASTONISHMENT
A WRETCHED TIME WE HAVE HAD FOR THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS SAID THE ORDERLY ONE DAY TO HIS MASTER
A PIGEON EXCLAIMED BEN ZOOF WHO HAD REACHED THE SCENE OF COMMOTION ADDING
FOR EVERY KILOGRAMME HE HAD TO WEIGH SEVEN
COUNT TIMASCHEFF LAID HIS HAND KINDLY ON THE CAPTAIN'S SHOULDER AND SAID MY FRIEND DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THE MOTTO OF THE OLD HOPE FAMILY HE SHOOK HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY
SERVADAC COULD NO LONGER ENTERTAIN A DOUBT THAT THE ENGLISHMEN HAD FORESTALLED HIM IN THE OCCUPATION OF CEUTA
TO HIM PERHAPS FOR A PROPER CONSIDERATION A LOAN MIGHT BE MADE
A DAILY COURSE OF OUT-DOOR EXERCISE WAS ENFORCED UPON EVERYONE
EUROPE 179 15 LEIUTENANT LIEUTENANT 241 14 COUD COULD END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF OFF ON A COMET BY JULES VERNE
AND ALTHOUGH A GOODLY NUMBER OF STACKS ATTESTED THE INDUSTRY OF BEN ZOOF DURING THE TIME OF THE DOBRYNA_'S VOYAGE IT WAS ONLY TOO APPARENT THAT THE PORTION OF THE HARVEST THAT REMAINED UNGATHERED WAS LIABLE TO THE MOST IMMINENT RISK OF BEING UTTERLY DEVOURED
THE MAN APPEARED SATISFIED AND FOR THE TIME AT LEAST DESISTED FROM HIS COMPLAINTS AND IMPORTUNITIES
THE STRAIT OF BONIFACIO HAD BEEN REPLACED BY A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER WHICH HAD AT FIRST ALL THE APPEARANCE OF BEING UTTERLY DESERT
A REALIZATION OF WHAT THE ILLUSTRIOUS MAUPERTUIS HAS ALREADY DEEMED PROBABLE REPLIED THE ASTRONOMER
OTHER AUTHORS WHO SINCE VERNE HAVE TOLD OF TRIPS THROUGH THE PLANETARY AND STELLAR UNIVERSE HAVE GIVEN FREE REIN TO FANCY TO DREAMS OF WHAT MIGHT BE FOUND
HOPE AND COURAGE REVIVED AS DAY BY DAY THE SUN'S DISC EXPANDED IN THE HEAVENS AND EVERY EVENING THE EARTH ASSUMED A GREATER MAGNITUDE AMONGST THE FIXED STARS
I TOLD YOU SO
A FEV
GENTLEMEN HE BEGAN I PROPOSE TO-DAY TO ENDEAVOR TO COMPLETE OUR OBSERVATIONS OF THE ELEMENTS OF MY COMET
MEANWHILE THE TEMPERATURE WAS STEADILY INCREASING
AND AS THE PRICE OF THAT IMPORTANT CESSION CONTINUED MAJOR OLIPHANT THEY HAVE RECEIVED A FAIR EQUIVALENT IN BRITISH GOLD AH CRIED BEN ZOOF THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THAT FELLOW NEGRETE AND HIS PEOPLE HAVING SUCH A LOT OF MONEY SERVADAC WAS SILENT
NO DIFFICULTY IN THAT I SHOULD IMAGINE ANSWERED SERVADAC AND HE APPEALED TO THE COUNT FOR CONFIRMATION OF HIS OPINION
THE COMPASS SHOWED THAT THE WIND HAD NEVER SHIFTED FROM THE WEST AND THIS WITH THE RATE OF SPEED AS ESTIMATED BY THE LOG COMBINED TO ASSURE HIM THAT AT THIS DATE THE 2D OF FEBRUARY THE SCHOONER WAS IN LAT
THE CAUSE OF SO MANY OF THE DISEASES THAT PROVE FATAL TO ARCTIC EXPLORERS RESIDES IN THE CUTTING WINDS UNWHOLESOME FOGS OR TERRIBLE SNOW DRIFTS WHICH BY DRYING UP RELAXING OR OTHERWISE AFFECTING THE LUNGS MAKE THEM INCAPABLE OF FULFILLING THEIR PROPER FUNCTIONS
THAT IT HAS CARRIED WITH IT AN ENVELOPE OF THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE AND THAT IT IS NOW TRAVELING THROUGH THE SOLAR SYSTEM IN AN ORBIT THAT DOES NOT CORRESPOND AT ALL WITH THE PROPER ORBIT OF THE EARTH THE HYPOTHESIS WAS PLAUSIBLE
INDEPENDENTLY OF THE INCREASED AND INCREASING HEAT THERE WAS ANOTHER VERY CONCLUSIVE DEMONSTRATION THAT THE EARTH HAD THUS SUDDENLY APPROXIMATED TOWARDS THE SUN
HE FAILED TO DECIPHER ANY INDICATIONS OF HILL AND PLAIN
BUT NIGHT WAS COMING ON AND THE SUN WAS ALREADY SINKING IN THE EAST WITH THE RAPIDITY TO WHICH THE RESIDENTS ON GALLIA WERE BY THIS TIME WELL ACCUSTOMED
THE MORE THEY CONTEMPLATED THE CHARACTER OF THIS GIGANTIC PLANET THE MORE THEY BECAME IMPRESSED WITH THE LIKELIHOOD OF A SERIOUS PERTURBATION IN THEIR OWN COURSE
AND ALMOST THE ONLY THING THAT BROKE THE MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE WAS AN OCCASIONAL VISIT FROM THE BLUSTERING NERVOUS LITTLE PROFESSOR WHEN SOME SUDDEN FANCY INDUCED HIM TO THROW ASIDE HIS ASTRONOMICAL STUDIES FOR A TIME AND PAY A VISIT TO THE COMMON HALL
AT LENGTH HE ENDEAVORED TO MINGLE WITH THE BUSY GROUP WHO WERE HURRYING ON THEIR PREPARATIONS
THOSE INFERNAL BIRDS
OUR DESTINY MIGHT HAVE BEEN FAR WORSE
EVERY ONE WAS PURSUING HIS ORDINARY AVOCATION
CAPTAIN SERVADAC HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO DECLARE HIS ATTACHMENT
HE WAS RATHER MORE THAN FIVE FEET SIX INCHES HIGH SLIM AND GRACEFUL WITH DARK CURLING HAIR AND MUSTACHES WELL-FORMED HANDS AND FEET AND A CLEAR BLUE EYE
HE COULD NOT CONCEAL HIS OPINION THAT SUCH A DESTINY FOR THE WORK OF A FRENCHMAN COULD BE NO MATTER OF SURPRISE
BUT THE OLD MAN GUESSING THAT THE ORDERLY WAS ONLY LAUGHING AT HIM AS USUAL PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE REMARK AND ONLY MEDITATED UPON THE MEANS HE COULD DEVISE TO GET EVERY BIT OF THE MONEY IN THE NEW WORLD INTO HIS OWN POSSESSION
YOUR EXCELLENCY MOANED THE AGITATED JEW PROTECT ME
THEN HAVING GIVEN A LAST GLANCE OVER THE DREARY PANORAMA THEY PREPARED TO WEND THEIR WAY DOWN THE MOUNTAIN
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES HE MUST KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO MAKE A REQUISITION OF HIS GOODS NO NO QUICKLY REJOINED SERVADAC
THE PERISHING TEMPERATURE OF THE CABIN HOWEVER WAS SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ORDERLY'S CONDUCT AND BY A LITTLE SKILLFUL MANIPULATION HE SOON SUCCEEDED IN GETTING UP A TOLERABLE FIRE
ONE THING HOWEVER ON THE OTHER HAND MIGHT CONDUCE TO A MUTUAL AND PERMANENT IMPRESSION ON THEIR MEMORIES
AND AS THEY WERE ALREADY CONSCIOUS OF A FURTHER INCREASE OF MUSCULAR POWER AND A FRESH DIMINUTION OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY SERVADAC AND HIS ASSOCIATES COULD NOT BUT WONDER WHETHER THE ALTERATION IN THE MASS OF THE COMET WOULD NOT RESULT IN ITS MISSING THE EXPECTED COINCIDENCE WITH THE EARTH ALTOGETHER
BUT AS HITHERTO THE SEA HAD ENCROACHED UPON THE LAND THE LAND IN ITS TURN NOW ENCROACHED UPON THE SEA
WE ARE GOING TO WEIGH GALLIA WITH IT
ANOTHER THING THAT NOW STRUCK SERVADAC WAS THE EXTRAORDINARY CONTRACTION OF THE HORIZON
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL AND THE MINISTER OF WAR WERE DOUBTLESS FAR DIFFERENTLY OCCUPIED AND THEIR INTERESTS FAR OTHERWISE ENGROSSED
THAT THIS DIMINUTION WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE CHANGE IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION THAT ADMITTED OF LITTLE DOUBT
STOP A MOMENT SAID THE CAPTAIN
LEANING OVER THE SIDE OF THE CAR HE KEPT HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE ABANDONED COMET NOW FLOATING ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF BELOW HIM BRIGHT IN THE GENERAL IRRADIATION WHICH WAS FLOODING THE SURROUNDING SPACE
BEYOND THE VOLCANIC PEAK MOREOVER THE WATERS SEEMED TO EXPAND INTO A BOUNDLESS OCEAN AND IT MIGHT BE A THING FULL OF RISK TO BE FROZEN UP WHILE THE YACHT WAS SO INADEQUATELY PROVISIONED
THOSE IMMEDIATELY NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR WERE OF A DUSKY HUE
FAR FROM THAT
INDIFFERENT TO THE DANGERS THAT MUST NECESSARILY ATTEND A BALLOON ASCENT UNDER SUCH UNPARALLELED CIRCUMSTANCES AND HEEDLESS OF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE'S WARNING THAT THE SLIGHTEST CHECK IN THEIR PROGRESS WOULD RESULT IN INSTANTANEOUS COMBUSTION THEY ALL SEEMED TO CONCLUDE THAT IT MUST BE THE SIMPLEST THING POSSIBLE TO GLIDE FROM ONE ATMOSPHERE TO ANOTHER SO THAT THEY WERE QUITE SANGUINE AS TO THE SUCCESSFUL ISSUE OF THEIR ENTERPRISE
FLIC
THE MOST REMOTE REVOLVES ROUND THE PLANET AT A DISTANCE OF 1,192,820 MILES
WHY SHOULD IT NOT ROLL ONWARDS LIKE THE MOON A DARK COLD MASS IN SPACE
AND PERHAPS YOU ARE GOING TO USE IT TO WEIGH SOMETHING VERY HEAVY WHY OLD EPHRAIM DO YOU SUPPOSE WE ARE GOING TO WEIGH A MOUNTAIN WITH IT SAID BEN ZOOF
SERVADAC HOWEVER DECLINED TO ENTER UNTIL HE HAD TAKEN THE PAINS TO EXPLAIN TO THE OWNER OF THE TARTAN THAT HE HAD NO INTENTION OF LAYING VIOLENT HANDS UPON HIS PROPERTY AND THAT IF THE TIME SHOULD EVER COME THAT HIS CARGO WAS IN REQUISITION FOR THE COMMON USE HE SHOULD RECEIVE A PROPER PRICE FOR HIS GOODS THE SAME AS HE WOULD IN EUROPE
THIS CAPTAIN SERVADAC IS ENGLISH TERRITORY
BUT SCARCELY HAD HE DONE SO WHEN SERVADAC NOTICED THAT HIS WAIST WAS ENCOMPASSED BY AN ENORMOUS GIRDLE THAT BULGED OUT TO A VERY EXTRAORDINARY EXTENT
IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE EFFECT OF THIS CONTINUOUSLY OVERHANGING GLOOM SHOULD BE TO INDUCE A FREQUENT DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS AMONGST THE MAJORITY OF THE LITTLE POPULATION EXILES AS THEY WERE FROM THEIR MOTHER EARTH AND NOT UNLIKELY AS IT SEEMED TO BE SWEPT FAR AWAY INTO THE REGIONS OF ANOTHER PLANETARY SPHERE
NEW PLANTS WERE SPRINGING UP UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE EQUATORIAL SUN AND THE LUXURIANT FOLIAGE WAS TENANTED BY THE BIRDS WHICH HAD FLOWN BACK FROM THE VOLCANO
IT IS A GOOD THING YOU HAVE COME
HE MUST YIELD TO NECESSITY
THERE WERE NOT 20,000 MILES BETWEEN THE COMET AND THE EARTH
EUROPEAN PRICES I MEAN MERCIFUL HEAVENS SHRIEKED THE OLD MAN YOU ROB ME OF MY RIGHTS
A WIRE-WORK STOVE SUSPENDED BELOW THE CASING AND FILLED WITH LIGHTED HAY SERVED TO KEEP THE AIR IN THE INTERIOR AT A PROPER TEMPERATURE
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME GOGGLE-EYES THIS WAS ADDRESSED TO BEN ZOOF WHO WAS STARING HARD AT HIM
THEY INSTITUTED DEBATES IN WHICH EVERYBODY WAS ENCOURAGED TO TAKE PART
THEY BOTH PUSHED FORWARD WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED TILL THEY WERE WITHIN A MILE AND A HALF OF THE SHORE WHEN BEN ZOOF WHO HAD A VERY KEEN VISION STOPPED SUDDENLY AND SAID THAT HE WAS SURE HE COULD SEE SOMETHING MOVING ON THE TOP OF THE ISLAND
INVOLUNTARILY ONE AND ALL THEY PLOWED THEIR HEELS INTO THE ICE AND CAME TO A HALT
WHILST IN EVERY DIRECTION THE STRANGE SOIL WITH ITS COMMIXTURE OF TELLURIUM AND GOLD GLEAMED UNDER THE SUN'S RAYS WITH A PERPETUAL IRIDESCENCE
PSHAW
THE MOON'S COME BACK AND SURE ENOUGH WHAT WAS APPARENTLY THE MOON WAS RISING ABOVE THE MISTS OF EVENING
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ENGINE AND THE MASTS EVERYTHING HAD BEEN CLEARED OUT AND CONVEYED TO SHORE BUT IN THE EVENT OF A THAW IT APPEARED THAT NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE COULD PREVENT THE HULL FROM BEING DASHED TO PIECES AND THEN ALL MEANS OF LEAVING THE PROMONTORY WOULD BE GONE
IT CANNOT BE THAT THE FIRE IS HOTTER HE SAID THE PECULIARITY MUST BE IN THE WATER AND TAKING DOWN A CENTIGRADE THERMOMETER WHICH HUNG UPON THE WALL HE PLUNGED IT INTO THE SKILLET
LEAVING THE OLD MAN UNDER THE SURVEILLANCE OF THE COUNT AND BEN ZOOF THE CAPTAIN AND THE LIEUTENANT STEPPED INTO A SMALL BOAT AND WERE SOON ALONGSIDE THE FLOATING EMPORIUM
BUT FORTUNATELY THE WAVES DID NOT CULMINATE IN BREAKERS BUT RATHER IN A LONG SWELL WHICH RAN IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE VESSEL
IT WAS ONLY FROM THE FEW ASTRONOMICAL WORKS THAT HAPPENED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DOBRYNA'S LIBRARY THAT ANY DETAILS COULD BE GATHERED BUT THESE WERE SUFFICIENT TO GIVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF INTERESTING INFORMATION
THAT DISTANCE HAD BEEN ALREADY ESTIMATED TO BE SOMETHING UNDER 1,400 MILES SO THAT THE ARCTIC POLE OF THEIR RECENTLY FASHIONED WORLD MUST BE ABOUT 350 MILES TO THE NORTH AND THE ANTARCTIC ABOUT 350 MILES TO THE SOUTH OF THE ISLAND
BEFORE I PROCEED HE RESUMED I MUST RECALL TO YOUR MINDS NEWTON'S GENERAL LAW THAT THE ATTRACTION OF TWO BODIES IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE PRODUCT OF THEIR MASSES AND INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SQUARE OF THEIR DISTANCES YES SAID SERVADAC
NEGRETE AND HIS FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN YIELDED TO THEIR DESTINY WITH PHILOSOPHICAL INDIFFERENCE
AND NOW HE WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS RIGHT IN IDENTIFYING THE POSITION AND IN BELIEVING THAT THE SMOKE HAD GIVEN PLACE TO AN ERUPTION OF FLAME
WHERE HAVE I SEEN THIS MAN THOUGHT SERVADAC TO HIMSELF
IN THE CENTER WAS A TOMB OF THE VERY SIMPLEST KIND AND ABOVE THE TOMB WAS SUSPENDED A LARGE SILVER LAMP WITH A CAPACIOUS RESERVOIR OF OIL IN WHICH FLOATED A LONG LIGHTED WICK THE FLAME OF WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY THE LIGHT THAT HAD ATTRACTED SERVADAC'S ATTENTION ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
AND YOU ALWAYS WERE A VERY CLEVER SCHOLAR TOO
WITH VENUS ONLY DID COLLISION APPEAR IMMINENT
IF SERVADAC AND HIS ORDERLY HAD BEEN LESS PREOCCUPIED THEY WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT A VARIETY OF OTHER PHYSICAL CHANGES BESIDES THE APPARENT ALTERATION IN THE MOVEMENT OF THE SUN HAD BEEN EVOLVED DURING THE ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES OF THAT NEW YEAR'S NIGHT
THE SPANIARDS AND THE RUSSIAN SAILORS CROWDED ROUND FOR A FAREWELL SHAKE OF THE HAND AND LITTLE NINA HER GREAT EYES FLOODED WITH TEARS HELD UP HER FACE FOR A PARTING KISS
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO BEFORE YOU IDIOT ROARED THE EXCITABLE LITTLE MAN
ON CONSULTING HIS WATCH SERVADAC FOUND THAT NIGHT HAD LASTED PRECISELY SIX HOURS
BUT MANY DAYS WOULD OFTEN ELAPSE WITHOUT ANY ONE OF THEM ASCENDING TO THE SURFACE OF THE SOIL AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE NECESSITY OF OBTAINING FRESH WATER IT SEEMED ALMOST PROBABLE THAT THERE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN AN EFFORT MADE TO LEAVE THE CAVERN AT ALL
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WITH HIS HEAD ALL MUFFLED UP FOR FEAR OF FROST-BITE TOOK AN OCCASIONAL PEEP THROUGH AN APERTURE THAT HAD BEEN INTENTIONALLY LEFT IN THE ROOF AND BY THE HELP OF A COMPASS MAINTAINED A PROPER AND STRAIGHT COURSE FOR FORMENTERA
THE CHANGED POSITIONS OF THE PLANETS RENDERED THEM OF NO AVAIL FOR PURPOSES OF NAUTICAL OBSERVATION NOR COULD LIEUTENANT PROCOPE CALCULATE HIS LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE BY THE ALTITUDE OF THE SUN AS HIS RECKONINGS WOULD BE USELESS WHEN APPLIED TO CHARTS THAT HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED FOR THE OLD ORDER OF THINGS
THEY FOUND THE GOURBI AND THE ADJACENT BUILDING QUITE UNINJURED BY THE SEVERITY OF THE WINTER
A SUPPLY OF FRESH WATER WOULD BE CONSTANTLY REQUIRED
HE WAS A NATIVE OF MONTMARTRE IN PARIS AND HOW OR WHY HE HAD OBTAINED HIS PATRONYMIC WAS ONE OF THOSE ANOMALIES WHICH THE MOST SAGACIOUS OF ETYMOLOGISTS WOULD FIND IT HARD TO EXPLAIN
AND HE QUITE AWARE THAT THE ENGLISHMEN WOULD ADHERE TO THE FICTION THAT THEY COULD BE SUPPOSED TO KNOW NOTHING THAT HAD TRANSPIRED PREVIOUS TO THE INTRODUCTION FELT HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RECAPITULATE MATTERS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
BEFORE THE OCCURRENCE OF THE RECENT PRODIGY THE BOTTOM OF THE MEDITERRANEAN JUST AT THIS POINT HAD FORMED A SUDDEN RIDGE ACROSS THE STRAITS OF LIBYA
CAPTE NERINA EN PASSANT
NATURALLY THEREFORE IT WOULD HAVE SET AT THE SAME TIME AS THE SUN
OUT WITH IT I SAY CRIED SERVADAC
LOOK HERE BEN ZOOF AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE POINTED TO THE LEFT WING OF THE BIRD
AH YES YES
AH YES YES
I WILL COME AGAIN TO-MORROW AND WITHOUT ALLOWING HAKKABUT TIME TO RENEW HIS LAMENTATIONS SERVADAC WENT AWAY
HERE IS A TRACE OF FRESH WATER THE FIRST THAT GALLIA HAS EXHIBITED SAID THE COUNT TO HIS COMPANIONS AS THEY TOILED UP THE PRECIPITOUS PATH
BEN ZOOF WAS LEFT UPON THE ISLAND TO SUPERINTEND THE STOWAGE OF THE FREIGHT WHILST SERVADAC FOUND ABUNDANT OCCUPATION IN OVERLOOKING ITS DISPOSAL WITHIN THE RECESSES OF THE MOUNTAIN
THIEVES
IT WAS DETERMINED THEREFORE FOR THE COLONY TO EMBARK ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AND TAKE UP THEIR RESIDENCE IN NINA'S HIVE
THE FOLLOWING EPISODE MAY SUFFICE IN A CERTAIN DEGREE TO ILLUSTRATE HIS CHARACTER
EVERY ONE LOOKED FORWARD TO SPENDING NEW YEAR'S DAY IN ANOTHER SPHERE ALTOGETHER AND BEN ZOOF HAD ALREADY PROMISED PABLO AND NINA ALL SORTS OF NEW YEAR'S GIFTS
AFTER TAKING LEAVE OF THE STAFF-OFFICER COUNT WASSILI TIMASCHEFF WENDED HIS WAY DOWN TO A SMALL CREEK AND TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE STERN OF A LIGHT FOUR-OAR THAT HAD BEEN AWAITING HIS RETURN
AND ACCORDINGLY NOT ONE PAWN HAD BEEN SACRIFICED WITHOUT A MOST VIGOROUS DEFENSE
BUT MAYBE--MAYBE WELL SAID SERVADAC WAITING BUT INCLINED TO KICK THE OLD RASCAL OUT OF HIS SIGHT
HARDER AND MORE RESISTING THAN GRANITE IT COULD NOT BE BLASTED BY ORDINARY POWDER
THERE WAS A GENERAL EAGERNESS TO BE QUIT OF GALLIA
A SMALL EXCAVATION TO THE LEFT OF THE COMMON HALL WAS ALLOTTED FOR THE SPECIAL USE OF SERVADAC AND THE COUNT
THE THREE LEADERS WITH BEN ZOOF MADE THEIR WAY TO THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE CRATER NOT WITH THE DESIGN OF MAKING ANY FURTHER EXAMINATION AS TO THE NATURE OF THE ROCK--FOR ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE TRUE ENOUGH THAT IT CONTAINED THIRTY PER CENT
THE CATASTROPHE WHICH HAD OVERWHELMED THE COUNTRY HAD LEFT A DOZEN EGGS UNINJURED AND UPON THESE WITH A GOOD DISH OF HIS FAMOUS COUSCOUS HE HOPED THAT HE AND HIS MASTER MIGHT HAVE A SUFFICIENTLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
THOSE OF THE VINTAGES OF FRANCE AND SPAIN WERE DRUNK IN TOASTING THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES AND EVEN RUSSIA WAS HONORED IN A SIMILAR WAY BY MEANS OF A FEW BOTTLES OF KUMMEL
WILL THAT SATISFY YOU HE SHOOK HIS HEAD DOUBTFULLY
SIX MILES AT LEAST OBSERVED THE ONE
TO USE A NAUTICAL EXPRESSION THEY HAD SAFELY ROUNDED THE POINT AND THEY HAD TO BE CONGRATULATED ON THEIR SUCCESSFUL NAVIGATION
THE COUNT RESUMED
WELL SAID SERVADAC I DON'T KNOW THAT IT MATTERS MUCH WHERE OUR NEW LITTLE PLANET COMES FROM OR WHAT IT IS MADE OF IF ONLY IT CARRIES FRANCE ALONG WITH IT AND RUSSIA ADDED THE COUNT
ALTHOUGH THE LIGHT RECEIVED FROM THE SUN IS COMPARATIVELY FEEBLE THE NIGHTS UPON SATURN MUST BE SPLENDID
CONGREGATING IN THE LARGE HALL THE HALF-FAMISHED CREATURES DID NOT HESITATE TO SNATCH BREAD MEAT OR FOOD OF ANY DESCRIPTION FROM THE HANDS OF THE RESIDENTS AS THEY SAT AT TABLE AND SOON BECAME SUCH AN INTOLERABLE NUISANCE THAT IT FORMED ONE OF THE DAILY DIVERSIONS TO HUNT THEM DOWN
AND NEXT IN ORDER TO MAKE A MORE THOROUGH ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE LIMITS AND CONDITION OF THE SECTION OF ALGERIAN TERRITORY OF WHICH THEY SEEMED TO BE LEFT AS THE SOLE OCCUPANTS THEY DISMOUNTED AND PROCEEDED ON FOOT TO THE SUMMIT OF ONE OF THE HIGHEST PEAKS
BUT HE NOW RAPIDLY BROUGHT THEM BACK AND READJUSTED THEM AS BEST HE COULD TO WHAT SEEMED TO BE THEIR NATURAL POSITION ON THE AQUILINE NOSE
BUT YET HOUR AFTER HOUR HE WOULD REMAIN CONSCIENTIOUSLY SCANNING THE SURFACE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN WHICH CALM AND DESERTED LAY OUTSTRETCHED BEFORE HIM
FIRST THE ROCKS OF THE COAST WERE LOST TO VIEW
RARELY HAD HE SEEN HIS MASTER SO MUCH AGITATED
THE BALLOON WAS SLIGHTLY IN THE REAR OF GALLIA A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT AUGURED SOMEWHAT FAVORABLY BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE PRESUMED THAT IF THE COMET PRECEDED THE BALLOON IN ITS CONTACT WITH THE EARTH THERE WOULD BE A BREAK IN THE SUDDENNESS OF TRANSFER FROM ONE ATMOSPHERE TO THE OTHER
THIS ATTRACTIVE FORCE WE KNOW BY THE INCREASE OF OUR OWN MUSCULAR FORCE MUST OF COURSE BE CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THAT AT THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
BUT HE WAS EFFECTUALLY SILENCED BY BEN ZOOF WHO TOLD HIM THAT IF HE MADE ANY MORE FUSS HE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PAY 50,000 FRANCS FOR A BALLOON-TICKET OR ELSE HE SHOULD BE LEFT BEHIND
THIS WAS A QUESTION WHICH THE COUNT WAS INCAPABLE OF SETTLING
IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF THEIR ENTIRE NATURE HAD BECOME DEGENERATE AND THAT LIKE TORTOISES THEY COULD SLEEP AND FAST TILL THE RETURN OF SUMMER
CAPE BON TOO THE MOST NORTHERN PROMONTORY OF AFRICA AND THE POINT OF THE CONTINENT NEAREST TO THE ISLAND OF SICILY HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL DEVASTATION
THE ORBIT OF THIS PLANET WAS ASSUREDLY INTERIOR TO THE ORBIT OF THE EARTH BECAUSE IT ACCOMPANIED THE SUN IN ITS APPARENT MOTION
SIDE BY SIDE THEY FOUGHT IN TWO CAMPAIGNS
ALTHOUGH THE BARRIER OF COOL RESERVE WAS SECRETLY INCREASING BETWEEN THE CAPTAIN AND THE COUNT THEY SCRUPULOUSLY CONCEALED ANY OUTWARD TOKEN OF THEIR INNER FEELINGS AND WITHOUT ANY PERSONAL BIAS APPLIED THEIR BEST ENERGIES TO THE DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION WHICH WAS OF SUCH MUTUAL NAY OF SUCH UNIVERSAL INTEREST
THAT'S JUST THE CHARM OF THEM MY GOOD FELLOW WAS THE CAPTAIN'S COOL REPLY THAT THEY ARE OF NO USE WHATEVER CHAPTER VIII
HOIST THE JIB AND RIGHT THE TILLER SUDDEN AND STARTLING AS THE UNEXPECTED ORDERS WERE THEY WERE EXECUTED AS IF BY MAGIC
ASTOUNDING AS IT SEEMED WHAT ALTERNATIVE WAS LEFT BUT TO SUPPOSE THAT THE ALGERIAN CAPITAL HAD BEEN COMPLETELY LEVELED BY THE FLOOD
THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS IN NO WAY MARRED BY THE FACT THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN DESTINED AS ONCE SEEMED LIKELY TO BE THE ADAM AND EVE OF A NEW WORLD
AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE THE PROBLEM STILL UNSOLVED THAT THE MEDITERRANEAN HAS EVIDENTLY BEEN TRANSPORTED TO THE EQUATORIAL ZONE BOTH THE COUNT AND THE CAPTAIN EXPRESSED THEMSELVES REASSURED BY HIS REPRESENTATIONS AND OBSERVED THAT THEY MUST NOW DO ALL IN THEIR POWER TO DISCOVER WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE VAST CONTINENT OF AFRICA OF WHICH THEY WERE HITHERTO FAILING SO COMPLETELY TO FIND A VESTIGE
AND WHEN THE COLONEL AND THE MAJOR HAD REPLACED THE PIECES ON THE BOARD WHICH HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY THE CONVULSION ANY SURPRISE THEY MIGHT HAVE FELT AT THE CHESS-MEN LOSING SOME PORTION OF THEIR WEIGHT WAS QUITE FORGOTTEN IN THE SATISFACTION OF SEEING THEM RETAIN THEIR EQUILIBRIUM
LOOK THERE AND AS BEN ZOOF SPOKE HE POINTED TO SOME SCYTHES AND SICKLES AND OTHER IMPLEMENTS OF HUSBANDRY THAT HAD BEEN LEFT UPON THE GROUND
BORN ON THE COUNT'S ESTATES THE SON OF A SERF WHO HAD BEEN EMANCIPATED LONG BEFORE THE FAMOUS EDICT OF THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER PROCOPE WAS SINCERELY ATTACHED BY A TIE OF GRATITUDE AS WELL AS OF DUTY AND AFFECTION TO HIS PATRON'S SERVICE
LET US SEE THAT WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER RIGHT
LOOK AND SEE GIVE IT A LITTLE PUSH PLEASE WHY BECAUSE--BECAUSE WELL BECAUSE OF WHAT CRIED THE ORDERLY IMPATIENTLY
WATCH THE SHEETS AN INVOLUNTARY CRY BROKE FORTH FROM ALL ON BOARD
SOON HOWEVER RECOVERING HIS EQUANIMITY HE CONTINUED
AND IF HASTE WERE NECESSARY SO ALSO WERE CARE INGENUITY AND FORETHOUGHT
SHE RESPONDED TO OUR GUN IT IS TO BE HOPED MUTTERED THE CORPORAL THAT OUR BALL HAS DONE HER NO DAMAGE BEFORE LONG THE HULL WAS FULL IN SIGHT
WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT AFTER ALL COLLISION WOULD NOT OCCUR
AND ALTHOUGH HE KNEW WHAT EXPANSION MIGHT BE THE RESULT OF SUBTERRANEAN FORCES HE DID NOT VENTURE TO SAY THAT HE CONSIDERED IT SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE SO TREMENDOUS AN EFFECT
THE FIXED STARS TAUGHT HIM NOTHING
FIRST THE MEASURE OF GRAVITY AT ITS SURFACE
THE PREVIOUS ESCAPE WAS DOUBTLESS OWING TO SOME SLIGHT THOUGH UNACCOUNTABLE MODIFICATION IN THE RATE OF MOTION
THEY HURRIED ON TO SCALE THE HEIGHTS
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WAS IT PERFECTLY CERTAIN THAT NO DANGER COULD ACCRUE
THE PLAN THAT SEEMED TO COMMEND ITSELF MOST TO THEIR CONSIDERATION WAS THAT THEY SHOULD DIG OUT FOR THEMSELVES SOME SUBTERRANEOUS PITS SIMILAR TO SILOS SUCH AS ARE USED AS RECEPTACLES FOR GRAIN
WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT THEY WOULD NOT FAIL TO KEEP THEIR APPOINTMENT WITH MILITARY PUNCTUALITY THE TWO OFFICERS CORDIALLY WRUNG THEIR FRIEND'S HAND AND RETIRED TO THE ZULMA CAFE FOR A GAME AT PIQUET
WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED ONE OF THEM WHOM SERVADAC REMEMBERED TO HAVE SEEN BEFORE AT GIBRALTAR
YES READY MONEY
THE PROFESSOR KEPT MUTTERING IN INCOHERENT PHRASES
THESE RASCALS DEFRAUD ME OF MY RIGHTS
TO BE SURE I CAN
BEN ZOOF HAD NOT YET RECEIVED HIS ORDERS TO RETIRE AND ENSCONCING HIMSELF IN A CORNER OF THE GOURBI HE ENDEAVORED TO DOZE--A TASK WHICH THE UNUSUAL AGITATION OF HIS MASTER RENDERED SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT
THITHER ACCORDINGLY IT WAS DETERMINED TO PROCEED AND IN A FEW HOURS AFTER QUITTING THE ISLAND OF THE TOMB THE DOBRYNA WAS TRAVERSING THE SHALLOW WATERS THAT NOW COVERED THE PENINSULA OF DAKHUL WHICH HAD SEPARATED THE BAY OF TUNIS FROM THE GULF OF HAMMAMET
JUST AS THEY EXPECTED ON THE NORTH EAST AND WEST LAY THE GALLIAN SEA SMOOTH AND MOTIONLESS AS A SHEET OF GLASS THE COLD HAVING AS IT WERE CONGEALED THE ATMOSPHERE SO THAT THERE WAS NOT A BREATH OF WIND
ALL AT ONCE BEN ZOOF UTTERED A STARTLED CRY AND POINTED WITH BEWILDERED EXCITEMENT TOWARDS THE MOUNTAIN
WE MUST WAIT TILL TO-MORROW HE REPEATED
AND AS THERE SEEMED ALREADY TO BE AN ABUNDANCE OF GAME IT WAS HARDLY LIKELY THAT A FUTURE SUPPLY WOULD FAIL THEM
THAT SPEECH IS NOT LIKE YOURSELF ANSWERED SERVADAC SMILING
IF WE CANNOT GET ROUND BY THE SOUTH TO MOSTAGANEM WE MUST GO EASTWARDS TO TENES AND FORTHWITH THEY STARTED
THE CORDS WERE CUT
IT IS A VERY DELICATE INSTRUMENT YOUR EXCELLENCY
A FORMATION SUCH AS THIS PLAINLY INDICATED THAT AT SOME REMOTE EPOCH CAPE BON HAD BEEN CONNECTED WITH CAPE FURINA THE EXTREMITY OF SICILY IN THE SAME MANNER AS CEUTA HAS DOUBTLESS BEEN CONNECTED WITH GIBRALTAR
ON APPROACHING THE CREEK LIEUTENANT PROCOPE DREW HIS COMPANIONS ATTENTION TO THE ELEVATION OF THE DOBRYNA'S AND HANSA'S WATERLINE BOTH VESSELS BEING NOW SOME FIFTEEN FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA
HERE HE IS LAUGHED BEN ZOOF CONTEMPTUOUSLY
OF ALL THE BOMBS HOWITZERS AND VARIOUS SPECIES OF ARTILLERY WITH WHICH THE FORTRESS HAD BEEN CROWDED ONE SOLITARY PIECE REMAINED
A POUND WILL LAST ME FOR A LONG TIME AND WHO WILL WEIGH IT FOR YOU ASKED ROSETTE SCARCELY ABLE TO CONCEAL THE EAGERNESS THAT PROMPTED THE QUESTION
OR 68 DEGREES FAHR AND SOMETIMES DESCENDED AS LOW AS 15 DEGREES
SHE HAD DISAPPEARED FOR WEEKS
I MUST PUT A STOP TO THIS AND HE MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE DOOR
HE WAS RATHER DISPOSED TO SUSPECT THAT IT WAS NOT THE EARTH'S SATELLITE AT ALL BUT SOME PLANET WITH ITS APPARENT MAGNITUDE GREATLY ENLARGED BY ITS APPROXIMATION TO THE EARTH
THE ONLY CREATURE FOR WHICH THERE WAS FOUND A PLACE WAS THE CARRIER-PIGEON THAT HAD BROUGHT THE PROFESSOR'S MESSAGE TO THE HIVE
THE FIRST VOYAGE HAD BEEN MADE BY SERVADAC WITH SEVERAL OF THE SAILORS
BY WHICH I MEAN THAT IF WE WERE ON THE EARTH AND I WERE TO HANG THE BAG ON THE HOOK OF THE STEELYARD THE INDICATOR ON THE DIAL WOULD REGISTER ONE KILOGRAMME
AND I SUPPOSE THAT HAVING CROSSED THE ORBIT OF VENUS WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF RUNNING INTO THE ORBIT OF MERCURY AND FINISH UP BY A COLLISION WITH THE SUN ADDED THE COUNT
NO SPECULATION NO SCIENCE NO EXPERIENCE COULD INDUCE THEM TO GIVE UP THEIR FOND AND SANGUINE ANTICIPATION THAT ONCE AGAIN THEY WERE TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THE EARTH
WE CAN HARDLY CARRY OURSELVES
THE SURFACE OF THE SEA REMAINED AS FROZEN AS EVER AND THE TWO VESSELS HIGH UP ON THEIR ICY PEDESTALS REMAINED UNALTERED IN THEIR CRITICAL POSITION
ALL DIFFERENCE OF RACE ALL DISTINCTION OF NATIONALITY MUST BE MERGED INTO THE ONE THOUGHT THAT FEW AS THEY WERE THEY WERE THE SOLE SURVIVING REPRESENTATIVES OF A WORLD WHICH IT SEEMED EXCEEDINGLY IMPROBABLE THAT THEY WOULD EVER SEE AGAIN
YES ENTIRELY ROUND IT ANSWERED SERVADAC AND WITHOUT ALLOWING TIME FOR REPLY PROCEEDED AND THIS IS MY ORDERLY BEN ZOOF AIDE-DE-CAMP TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR OF GALLIA INTERPOSED BEN ZOOF HIMSELF ANXIOUS TO MAINTAIN HIS MASTER'S HONOR AS WELL AS HIS OWN
IS IT POSSIBLE THE DIMINUTION OF THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION AT THE EARTH'S SURFACE WAS SO CONSIDERABLE THAT THE BALL HAD SPED BEYOND THE HORIZON
AND NOT ONLY CAN I TESTIFY THAT MALTA HAS DISAPPEARED BUT I CAN AFFIRM THAT A LARGE SECTION OF THE MEDITERRANEAN HAS BEEN CLOSED IN BY A NEW CONTINENT
SERVADAC WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY VEILED IN HEAVY CLOUDS THE SUN HAD SUNK BELOW THE HORIZON THAT BOUNDED THE PLAIN BEYOND THE SHELIF
THE OFFICER IN COMMAND OF CEUTA YES IF THERE IS ONE I WILL ACQUAINT HIM WITH YOUR ARRIVAL ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN AND DISAPPEARED
HIS WATCH ENABLED HIM TO KEEP AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF THE PASSING HOURS
LET US PUT THE RANGE OF THE PIECE TO THE TEST A GOOD IDEA REPLIED THE MAJOR
WHERE ARE YOU BEN ZOOF HE SHOUTED
GALLIA HAD REACHED ITS APHELION
AND ACCORDINGLY I GIVE YOU THE COMMISSION TO SEE THAT YOUR CREW BRING HER ROUND TO THE SHELIF AS SOON AS MAY BE TO-MORROW MORNING IT SHALL BE DONE ANSWERED THE LIEUTENANT PROMPTLY
WHEN SERVADAC GAVE HIM A CHANCE OF SPEAKING HE SAID THE MORE I CONSIDER IT CAPTAIN THE MORE I AM SATISFIED THAT YOUR CONJECTURE IS CORRECT
I MUST BE EITHER ASLEEP OR MAD IT IS VERY CERTAIN THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO US SAID BEN ZOOF
IT WAS NOT LONG HOWEVER BEFORE A DISCOVERY MORE UNEXPECTED THAN AGREEABLE SUDDENLY ARRESTED THEIR LABORS
THUS I SHALL ARRIVE AT THE DIFFERENCE I WANT
OUR FIRE IS LIGHTED
IT WILL BE FINE SPORT TO WATCH THE OLD JEW'S FACE WHEN HE IS MADE TO COMPREHEND THAT HE IS FLYING AWAY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF LEAGUES FROM ALL HIS DEBTORS ISAAC HAKKABUT WAS ABOUT FIFTY YARDS BEHIND AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY UNABLE TO OVERHEAR THE CONVERSATION
ENGLAND WILL BE SURE TO SEND FOR US SAID ONE OFFICER
THE TEMPERATURE MEANWHILE CONTINUED TO DECREASE AND THE AVERAGE READING OF THE THERMOMETER WAS ABOUT 16 DEGREES F
ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU GOOD-AFTERNOON AND WITHOUT FURTHER PARLEY FOLLOWED BY HIS SOLDIERS HE RETIRED INTO THE CASEMATE LEAVING CAPTAIN SERVADAC GNAWING HIS MUSTACHE WITH MINGLED RAGE AND MORTIFICATION
DOWNRIGHT DESPERATE THIEVES
WELL THEN CONTINUED SERVADAC IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE AT FAULT IN THIS RESPECT
AND BY ALL THE SAINTS OF MONTMARTRE THERE IS A LITTLE BAG ATTACHED TO ITS NECK HE TOOK THE BIRD AND RUSHING INTO THE HALL PLACED IT IN SERVADAC'S HANDS
JUPITER SOMEWHAT CLOSE EXCEPT AS TO THE TIME THE COMET WOULD TAKE TO REVOLVE ROUND THE SUN IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT ALL THE PROFESSOR'S CALCULATIONS HAD COMPARATIVELY LITTLE INTEREST FOR ANYONE BUT HIMSELF AND HE WAS CONSEQUENTLY LEFT VERY MUCH TO PURSUE HIS STUDIES IN SOLITUDE
BY CHRISTMAS DAY EVERYTHING WAS IN READINESS FOR IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE
WAS IT NOT LESS THAN THIRTY DEGREES
HE LABORED UNDER THE CONVICTION THAT HE HAD A WORK OF GENIUS TO COMPLETE
NOTHING UNWILLING TO HUMOR THE VANITY OF THE ECCENTRIC LITTLE MAN SERVADAC PROCEEDED TO GO THROUGH THE EXPECTED FORMALITIES
HERE WAS A MAN WHO HAD BEEN RESIDENT THREE MONTHS IN GALLIA A LIVING WITNESS OF ALL THE ABNORMAL PHENOMENA THAT HAD OCCURRED AND YET REFUSING TO BELIEVE THAT HIS HOPE OF MAKING GOOD BARGAINS WITH EUROPEAN TRADERS WAS AT AN END
FOR TWO DAYS SHE CONTINUED AN UNDEVIATING COURSE AND AFTER A FUTILE SEARCH FOR THE COAST OF TUNIS REACHED THE LATITUDE OF 34 DEGREES
WHEN PROFESSOR ROSETTE'S EQUANIMITY HAD BEEN RESTORED HE SAID THUS THEN GENTLEMEN THE DIAMETER THE SURFACE THE VOLUME OF MY COMET ARE SETTLED
THE SECTION OF THE RIGHT BANK OF THE SHELIF SEVENTY-TWO MILES
EAGER TO THROW SOME LIGHT UPON THE MYSTERY SERVADAC HURRIEDLY MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE OLEANDER BUSHES THAT OVERHUNG THE SHORE TOOK UP SOME WATER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND AND CARRIED IT TO HIS LIPS
ALL THE BETTER FOR YOU
IT LIES ROARED THE IRREPRESSIBLE ROSETTE
BUT NERINA IS A MOON NOW
AMONGST OTHERS VEGA IN THE CONSTELLATION LYRA IS 100 MILLIONS OF MILLIONS OF MILES AWAY
BEN ZOOF HE CALLED ALOUD
HE IS RUSHING ABOUT LIKE A MADMAN SCREECHING AND YELLING EUREKA EUREKA EXCLAIMED SERVADAC
BUT JUPITER ON THE OTHER HAND HAD ASSUMED SPLENDID PROPORTIONS
NEGRETE AND THE SPANIARDS NOW MASTERS OF THEIR NOVEL EXERCISE WANDERED FLEETLY AND GRACEFULLY HITHER AND THITHER OCCASIONALLY BEING OUT OF SIGHT COMPLETELY
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT A POUND
ON DESCENDING BE INFORMED THE CAPTAIN THAT THE PLAIN WAS DESERTED
THEY HAVE MADE THEIR REPRESENTATIONS SOMETHING IN THIS WAY
BUT FOR A CONSIDERABLE WHILE SERVADAC THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT REMAINED SILENT AND SUNK IN THOUGHT
THEY SAW NO NECESSITY FOR EXPENDING THE STRENGTH OF THE PEOPLE DURING THE SHORT SUMMER THAT WOULD INTERVENE UPON THE LONG SEVERITY OF WINTER IN THE CULTIVATION OR THE PRESERVATION OF THEIR AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES
MIMAS THE NEAREST TO ITS PRIMARY ROTATING ON ITS AXIS IN 221/2 HOURS AND REVOLVING AT A DISTANCE OF ONLY 120,800 MILES WHILST JAPETUS THE MOST REMOTE OCCUPIES 79 DAYS IN ITS ROTATION AND REVOLVES AT A DISTANCE OF 2,314,000 MILES
THE GREAT CURRENT OF AIR THAT RUSHED INTO THE APERTURE PENETRATED EVERYWHERE AND MADE RESPIRATION PERFECTLY EASY
LISTEN LADY TO MY VOWS O CONSENT TO BE MY SPOUSE
I CONFESS I AM PUZZLED FOR THE NEXT THIRTY-SIX HOURS UNTIL THE 4TH OF FEBRUARY THE SEA WAS EXAMINED AND EXPLORED WITH THE MOST UNFLAGGING PERSEVERANCE
TO ANY OBSERVER STATIONED ON THE PLANET BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF LAT
THE CHILD POINTED TO A BIRD WHICH SHE WAS CARESSING TENDERLY IN HER BOSOM
NEXT MORNING SERVADAC THUS ADDRESSED HIS PEOPLE
THE ATTRACTION AS WE HAVE SAID BEING LESS THE WEIGHT WILL PROPORTIONATELY BE LESS ALSO THEN AN ORDINARY PAIR OF SCALES BEING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ATTRACTION I SUPPOSE WOULD NOT ANSWER YOUR PURPOSE SUBMITTED THE LIEUTENANT
THE EARTH WILL BE TOO FAR OFF NOT TOO FAR OFF FOR US TO COME ACROSS HER ORBIT AT 42 MINUTES AND 35.6 SECONDS PAST TWO O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THIS COMING 1ST OF JANUARY THANKS MY DEAR PROFESSOR--MANY THANKS
AFTER THEIR PROLONGED IMMERSION IN THE BOILING WATER THE EGGS WERE FOUND TO BE ONLY JUST SUFFICIENTLY COOKED
TRUST ME WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DIP OUR SIPPETS INTO THE YOLKS EASILY ENOUGH THE CAPTAIN WAS QUITE RIGHT IN HIS CONJECTURE THAT THIS NEW PHENOMENON WAS CAUSED BY A DIMINUTION IN THE PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
IS NEWTON A FOOL
CHAPTER I
CHAPTER I
FOR IF I WERE TO BE PUT TO THE TORTURE I COULD NOT TELL WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE SUN MAY I ASK SIR WHAT WE ARE TO DO NOW PUT IN BEN ZOOF
THEY COULD ONLY CONJECTURE THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED SOME FLAW IN HIS RECKONINGS
IMPOSSIBLE SIR REJOINED BEN ZOOF
I SHOULD BE MORE INCLINED TO THINK IT IS A LIGHT ON BOARD SOME SHIP REPLIED THE COUNT
THE ONE THING UPON WHICH THEY COULD NOT FAIL TO BE CONSCIOUS WAS THAT THEY HAD NO PROSPECT OF OBTAINING PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR FIRST BUSINESS WAS TO DEVISE A SCHEME FOR GETTING AWAY FROM THEIR PRESENT ABODE
TO THE NAKED EYE THIS CONSTELLATION CONSISTS OF ONLY SIX STARS BUT THROUGH A TELESCOPE TEN INCHES IN DIAMETER AS MANY AS SIX THOUSAND ARE VISIBLE
AS SOON AS THE PROFESSOR HAD RECOVERED HIS BREATH EXHAUSTED BY HIS EXERTIONS HE SAID THE OLD REPROBATE THE RASCAL HAS CHEATED US
IT WAS ALL THAT NOW REMAINED OF THE FRENCH NATIONAL STANDARD
ONE SMALL STREAM OF LAVA AN OFF-SHOOT OF THE GREAT TORRENT SUFFICED TO WARM THE APARTMENT ENOUGH
THERE GENTLEMEN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-THREE GRAMMES
YOUR COMPLEXION ISN'T THE FAIREST IN THE WORLD BUT YOU ARE NOT BLACK YET WELL I HAD MUCH SOONER BE A WHITE FRIDAY THAN A BLACK ONE REJOINED BEN ZOOF
CAPTAIN SERVADAC WITH THE UNCONTROLLED VIVACITY NATURAL TO A FRENCHMAN WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
ENTERED THE ZONE OF THE TELESCOPIC PLANETS ON THE 10TH OF MARCH AND ATTRACTING NERINA CARRIED IT OFF AS A SATELLITE SERVADAC INTERPOSED
AY MORE THAN THAT REPLIED THE OTHER
THE BOWELS OF THE COMET THE WHOLE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN SPECULATING WITH GLOOMY FOREBODINGS UPON THE CHANCES OF THE FUTURE
I MEAN SAID PROCOPE THAT THE FARTHER THIS GALLIA OF OURS RECEDES FROM THE SUN THE LOWER THE TEMPERATURE WILL FALL
BUT NO SATISFACTORY ANSWER COULD BE FOUND
WE HAVE HAD A SHORT SUMMER AND WHO KNOWS WHETHER WE ARE NOT ENTERING UPON A WINTER THAT MAY LAST FOR YEARS PERHAPS FOR CENTURIES BUT WE MUST NOT MIND COUNT SAID SERVADAC SMILING
HEAVEN BE PRAISED EJACULATED THE CAPTAIN AND HE WENT ON IN THE TONES OF A KEEN EXCITEMENT
BUT WAS IT SO
AS THEY DESCENDED THE STEEP FOOTPATH LEADING FROM THE CLIFF TOWARDS THE SHELIF THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUS THAT THEIR RESPIRATION BECAME FORCED AND RAPID LIKE THAT OF A MOUNTAINEER WHEN HE HAS REACHED AN ALTITUDE WHERE THE AIR HAS BECOME LESS CHARGED WITH OXYGEN
BUT FOUR VILLAGES HAD ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED AND THE HEADLANDS UNABLE TO RESIST THE SHOCK OF THE CONVULSION HAD BEEN DETACHED FROM THE MAINLAND
THE RUSSIAN SAILORS ONLY THOUGHT WAS TO FOLLOW THEIR MASTER WHEREVER HE WENT
IMPORTANT CHANGES HAVE RESULTED FROM THE COLLISION
WITHOUT INCLUDING THE THIRTEEN ENGLISHMEN AT GIBRALTAR ABOUT WHOM HE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY DISPOSED TO GIVE HIMSELF MUCH CONCERN AT PRESENT SERVADAC PUT DOWN THE NAMES OF THE EIGHT RUSSIANS THE TWO FRENCHMAN AND THE LITTLE ITALIAN GIRL ELEVEN IN ALL AS THE ENTIRE LIST OF THE INHABITANTS OF GOURBI ISLAND
UPON RETURNING TO THE SHORE IT WAS ARRANGED THAT THE WHOLE OF THE LITTLE COLONY SHOULD FORTHWITH ASSEMBLE AT THE GOURBI
CEUTA AND GIBRALTAR WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN THE WEST HAD UTTERLY DISAPPEARED
NO PAPER REITERATED HAKKABUT
BUT THE PROFESSOR RESOLUTELY DECLINED TO OCCUPY IT SAYING THAT WHAT HE REQUIRED WAS A SMALL CHAMBER NO MATTER HOW SMALL PROVIDED THAT IT WAS ELEVATED AND SECLUDED WHICH HE COULD USE AS AN OBSERVATORY AND WHERE HE MIGHT PROSECUTE HIS STUDIES WITHOUT DISTURBANCE
1
THE EARTH 91,430,000 MILES FROM THE SUN QUITTED HIS BURNING BOSOM 100,000,000 YEARS AGO
NO WREATH OF SMOKE ROSE ABOVE THE LITTLE ISLAND
36 DEGREES 49 MIN N
THE DOBRYNA'S CREW WITH THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT STARTED FOR RUSSIA AND THE SPANIARDS PROVIDED BY THE COUNT'S LIBERALITY WITH A COMPETENCY THAT ENSURED THEM FROM WANT WERE DESPATCHED TO THEIR NATIVE SHORES
I NEVER SAW SUCH A JUMP MEANTIME THE JACKAL HAD SEATED ITSELF UPON ITS HAUNCHES AND WAS STARING AT THE TWO MEN WITH AN AIR OF IMPUDENT DEFIANCE
THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE WHICH IN THESE REGIONS HAD POINTED ABOUT 22 DEGREES FROM THE NORTH POLE HAD NEVER DEVIATED IN THE LEAST--A PROOF THAT ALTHOUGH EAST AND WEST HAD APPARENTLY CHANGED PLACES NORTH AND SOUTH CONTINUED TO RETAIN THEIR NORMAL POSITION AS CARDINAL POINTS
WHO COULD WONDER THAT ROSETTE ENTHUSIAST AS HE WAS SHOULD BE IRREMOVABLE FROM HIS OBSERVATORY
RESTLESS AND AGITATED PROFESSOR ROSETTE IF HE TOOK ANY INTEREST IN THESE DISCUSSIONS CERTAINLY TOOK NO SHARE IN THEM
IN FACT THEY WERE SCARCELY MORE THAN A MILE FROM MOSTAGANEM AND IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR WHEN THEY HAD ALL RECOVERED FROM THE BEWILDERMENT OCCASIONED BY THE SHOCK THEY STARTED OFF IN A BODY AND MADE THEIR WAY TO THE TOWN
THE MAGNITUDE OF GALLIA IS FAR TOO INSIGNIFICANT FOR HER POWER OF ATTRACTION TO CARRY OFF THE MOON BUT PERSISTED SERVADAC WHY SHOULD NOT THE SAME CONVULSION THAT TORE US AWAY FROM THE EARTH HAVE TORN AWAY THE MOON AS WELL
BREATHLESS AND HALF EXHAUSTED AS WAS THE JEW HE RUSHED WITH AN EFFORT TOWARDS SERVADAC AND EXCLAIMED IN FRENCH MARKED BY A STRONG TEUTONIC ACCENT OH MY LORD GOVERNOR HELP ME HELP
THE CAPTAIN HAD CEASED TO BE SURPRISED THAT NO VESSEL HAD BEEN SENT TO RESCUE HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANION FROM THEIR STRANGE IMPRISONMENT
IT WAS STILL BITTERLY COLD BUT THE ATMOSPHERE HAD LOST NOTHING OF ITS FORMER STILLNESS AND NOT A CLOUD WAS VISIBLE FROM HORIZON TO ZENITH
WAS IT MERE FANCY
EVERY PASSENGER IN THE QUIVERING CAR INVOLUNTARILY CLUNG SPASMODICALLY TO ITS SIDES AND AS THE TWO ATMOSPHERES AMALGAMATED CLOUDS ACCUMULATED IN HEAVY MASSES INVOLVING ALL AROUND IN DENSE OBSCURITY WHILE FLASHES OF LURID FLAME THREW A WEIRD GLIMMER ON THE SCENE
THE INTERNAL FIRE IS NOT ALL EXTINCT
NO LAND WAS VISIBLE IN ANY DIRECTION
BESIDES BEING ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL DISTRICT TOWNS OF THE PROVINCE OF ORAN IT WAS ALSO A MILITARY STATION
BY OPENING A SHUTTER THEY ADMITTED WHAT DAYLIGHT THEY COULD
NO TRACE INDEED SURVIVED OF ANY PORTION OF SICILY
I HAVE ALSO MADE THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO THE TEXT
ON ENTERING THE CRATER THEY FOUND THAT THE SIDES SLANTED AT THE ANGLE OF ABOUT 4 DEGREES
BY ALL THAT'S PITIFUL I ENTREAT YOU COME AND EXPLORE THE FARTHEST VERGE OF THE ICE-BOUND TRACK HE PUSHED ONWARDS ALONG THE RUGGED SURFACE OF THE ROCK BUT HAD NOT PROCEEDED FAR BEFORE HE CAME TO A SUDDEN PAUSE
THE WIND AFTER VEERING TO THE WEST HAD SUNK TO A PERFECT CALM
CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND HIS ORDERLY AT THE TIME OF WHICH I WRITE THERE MIGHT BE SEEN IN THE REGISTERS OF THE MINISTER OF WAR THE FOLLOWING ENTRY
I SAY OLD MORDECAI WOULDN'T YOU RATHER GIVE YOUR GOODS AWAY THAN SELL THEM AT THIS RATE
IN SPITE OF THE COLD HE HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE THE DAY OF HIS ARRIVAL FROM GOURBI ISLAND
NOT A CLOUD EVER TEMPERED THE INTENSITY OF THE SOLAR RAYS
THE CAPTAIN WAS INEXORABLE
AND CAPTAIN SERVADAC AFTER THE EXAMPLE OF ALL PREVIOUS CRUSOES BEGAN TO CONSIDER IT ADVISABLE TO INVESTIGATE THE RESOURCES OF HIS DOMAIN
ONLY ABOUT SIXTY-SIX POUNDS SAID ISAAC
YOU CAN BE HER FATHER AND I CAN BE HER MOTHER SERVADAC LAUGHED
THE GOURBI BEING IN RUINS THEY WERE OBLIGED TO PUT UP WITH THE BEST ACCOMMODATION THEY COULD FIND IN THE ADJACENT ERECTION
HAVE YOU ANY NOTION WHAT HAS HAPPENED BEN ZOOF I'VE A NOTION CAPTAIN THAT IT'S ALL UP WITH US NONSENSE BEN ZOOF
SECONDLY THE VALUABLE CARGO OF THE HANSA WHICH SOONER OR LATER THE OWNER WHETHER HE WOULD OR NOT MUST BE COMPELLED TO SURRENDER FOR THE COMMON BENEFIT
IT HAD CRACKED LIKE A DRY NUT
COME I SAY OLD JEDEDIAH YOU ARE A LONG WHILE MAKING UP WHAT'S SHORT SAID BEN ZOOF WHILE THE JEW WAS STILL STAMMERING ON
HER ORBIT WAS CIRCUMSCRIBED TO LITTLE OVER 1,500 MILLIONS OF MILES
FIRST OF ALL THE LARGE STORE OF CORN AND FODDER THE PRODUCE OF THE RECENT HARVEST WAS LANDED AND DEPOSITED IN ONE OF THE VAULTS
CHAPTER IX MARKET PRICES IN GALLIA ALL RIGHT SAID SERVADAC CONVINCED BY THE PROFESSOR'S ILL HUMOR THAT THE DANGER WAS PAST
AND WE SHALL PERHAPS BY TAKING THEM SERIATIM BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO JUDGE WHETHER WE CAN SUCCESSFULLY GRAPPLE WITH THEM OR IN ANY WAY MITIGATE THEIR CONSEQUENCES THERE WAS A GENERAL ATTITUDE OF ATTENTION
HOW DREARY
YOUR ENTERPRISE IS GENEROUS HE SAID AND I SHOULD BE MOST UNWILLING TO THROW ANY UNNECESSARY OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF ITS EXECUTION
IF THE COMET HAD IMPINGED PERPENDICULARLY IT MUST HAVE PLOWED ITS WAY DEEP BELOW THE SURFACE AND THE DISASTERS IT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED ARE BEYOND RECKONING
SUCH IN HIS SOLITUDE WERE OLD ISAAC'S COGITATIONS WHILST THE UNIVERSAL POPULATION OF NINA'S HIVE WERE CONGRATULATING THEMSELVES UPON BEING RID OF HIS ODIOUS PRESENCE
IT IS GOING SAID HE
THE WEATHER EVER SINCE THE STORM THAT HAD DRIVEN THE DOBRYNA INTO THE CREEK HAD BEEN MAGNIFICENT
NOW TELL US WHAT INTEREST DO YOU EXPECT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME THE JEW'S ANXIETY TO MAKE ANOTHER GOOD BARGAIN
HOW SOON MAY WE HOPE TO GET BACK HE INQUIRED
TOUCH ME IF YOU DARE SCREAMED ROSETTE DRAWING HIMSELF UP TO THE FULLEST HEIGHT HIS DIMINUTIVE FIGURE WOULD ALLOW
IN THREE HOURS TIME WITHOUT ANY INTERVENING TWILIGHT THE MORNING SUN MADE ITS APPEARANCE IN THE WEST AND DAY ONCE MORE HAD DAWNED
CAN I SPEAK TO YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER SERVADAC INQUIRED
BEN ZOOF CONTINUED HIS SLEEP IS GETTING MORE COMPOSED
BUT NO PHILOSOPHY COULD BE PROOF AGAINST THE COMMON INSTINCTS OF THEIR HUMANITY
ORBE FRACTO SPES ILLOESA CONTINUED THE COUNT--"THOUGH THE WORLD BE SHATTERED HOPE IS UNIMPAIRED SERVADAC SMILED FAINTLY AND REPLIED THAT HE FELT RATHER COMPELLED TO TAKE UP THE DESPAIRING CRY OF DANTE ALL HOPE ABANDON YE WHO ENTER HERE NAY NOT SO ANSWERED THE COUNT
THESE EVENTS ALL BELONG FRANKLY TO THE REALM OF FAIRYLAND
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WAS TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN TO BE UNAWARE OF THIS PECULIARITY AND WOULD NOT LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASCERTAINING WHETHER THE SUBMARINE RIDGE STILL EXISTED OR WHETHER THE SEA-BOTTOM BETWEEN SICILY AND AFRICA HAD UNDERGONE ANY MODIFICATION
THE MAIN INCONVENIENCE THAT WAS EXPERIENCED WAS THE DIMINUTION IN HER PROPER RATE OF SPEED
WELL THEN NEVER MIND REPLIED THE PROFESSOR QUICKLY APPEASED
ROSETTE HOWEVER DID NOT POSSESS A REFLECTOR OF THIS MAGNITUDE AND WAS OBLIGED TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE GOOD BUT COMPARATIVELY SMALL INSTRUMENT HE HAD
REGARDLESS OF THE EFFORTS THAT WERE MADE TO SILENCE HIM THE JEW CONTINUED BY THE GOD OF ABRAHAM I BESEECH YOU GIVE ME SOME TIDINGS OF EUROPE EUROPE SHOUTED THE PROFESSOR SPRINGING FROM HIS SEAT AS IF HE WERE ELECTRIFIED
BUT WE MUST RECOLLECT THAT COMPARED TO THE GREAT PLANETS GALLIA MUST BE ALMOST INFINITESIMALLY SMALL AND SO MIGHT BE ATTRACTED BY A FORCE THAT IS IRRESISTIBLE ALTOGETHER THEN SAID SERVADAC WE SEEM TO HAVE SETTLED IT TO OUR ENTIRE SATISFACTION THAT WE MUST BE THE POPULATION OF A YOUNG LITTLE WORLD CALLED GALLIA
ALL THAT WE REQUIRE IS WARMTH--WARMTH FOR OURSELVES
I KNOW BETTER THAN THAT AND SO DO YOU
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT HE HAD ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH WERE OF THE MOST PARAMOUNT INTEREST TO THEM ALL
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT OF COURSE REPLIED SERVADAC
SO ON THAT POINT I HAD BETTER HOLD MY TONGUE HANG YOUR MYSTERIES SAID THE COLONEL
CERTAINLY THE PROFESSOR ASSENTED
NOT THAT I EVER SUPPOSED FOR A MINUTE AS YOU DID THAT I WAS STILL UPON THE EARTH
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE SUPERINTENDED HIS FINAL ARRANGEMENTS
AND THE CAPTAIN AND THE COUNT WERE ON THE POINT OF PARTING FROM EACH OTHER WITH A SALUTE OF PUNCTILIOUS COURTESY WHEN TIMASCHEFF AS IF STRUCK BY A SUDDEN THOUGHT SAID ABRUPTLY
THIS IS CLEAR ENOUGH I SUPPOSE AS HE SPOKE THE PROFESSOR DESIGNEDLY KEPT HIS EYES FIXED UPON BEN ZOOF
BUT YET HE CONTINUED AFTER A PAUSE ONE THING IS TOLERABLY CERTAIN
WHY WE SHALL PAY YOU IN GOLD AND SILVER AND COPPER WHILE OUR MONEY LASTS AND WHEN THAT IS GONE WE SHALL PAY YOU IN BANK NOTES OH NO PAPER NO PAPER GROANED OUT THE JEW RELAPSING INTO HIS ACCUSTOMED WHINE
CAPTAIN SERVADAC'S DEEP DEJECTION WAS IN STRANGE CONTRAST TO HIS GENERAL HILARITY
AND HE FROWNED AND MADE A GESTURE OF REPUGNANCE
HIS DELIGHT AMOUNTED ALMOST TO DELIRIUM
YOU WILL NOT FIND THEM HARD MY GOOD FELLOW
CORFU DID YOU SAY ASKED MAJOR OLIPHANT
SOMEHOW OR OTHER THE CONVERSATION WOULD EVENTUALLY WORK ITS WAY ROUND TO THE TOPIC OF A FUTURE COLLISION BETWEEN THE COMET AND THE EARTH
GRAVITY HAS BEEN DIMINISHED
AT THIS DATE SATURN WAS REVOLVING AT A DISTANCE OF 420,000,000 MILES FROM GALLIA AND CONSEQUENTLY 874,440,000 MILES FROM THE SUN RECEIVING ONLY A HUNDREDTH PART OF THE LIGHT AND HEAT WHICH THAT LUMINARY BESTOWS UPON THE EARTH
ALL FIRST RATE
GALLIA'S PATH EXTENDING BEYOND THE ORBIT OF JUPITER LAY CLEARLY DEFINED BEFORE THEIR EYES THE PROGRESS ALONG THE ORBIT AND THE SOLAR DISTANCES BEING INSERTED FOR EACH MONTH SEPARATELY
INTERRUPTED EFFUSIONS COMPOSED OF MUD AND LOOSE STONES AND COVERED WITH A THATCH OF TURF AND STRAW KNOWN TO THE NATIVES BY THE NAME OF DRISS THE GOURBI THOUGH A GRADE BETTER THAN THE TENTS OF THE NOMAD ARABS WAS YET FAR INFERIOR TO ANY HABITATION BUILT OF BRICK OR STONE
HIS BOOKS HIS SCANTY WARDROBE HIS PAPERS HIS INSTRUMENTS AND THE BLACKBOARD WHICH HAD SERVED FOR HIS CALCULATIONS WERE QUICKLY COLLECTED
THERE WERE VARIOUS REASONS WHY HE SHOULD BE LEFT BEHIND NOT THE LEAST IMPORTANT BEING THAT THE SCHOONER HAD NO ACCOMMODATION FOR HORSES AND THE ORDERLY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT HARD TO PART WITH ZEPHYR AND MUCH MORE WITH HIS OWN FAVORITE GALETTE
HA HA LAUGHED THE ORDERLY ALOUD
I DO NOT THINK HE SAID TO COUNT TIMASCHEFF AND LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THAT WE OUGHT TO ALLOW OUR PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR INTEREST IN THE WORLD TO WHICH WE ARE ALL HOPING TO RETURN
SHE WAS NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO WANDER AWAY INTO THE RANGE OF ATTRACTION OF ANOTHER CENTER
AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY THE BALLOON WAS INFLATED WITH PERFECT SUCCESS AND THE CAR WAS SECURELY ATTACHED TO THE NETWORK
HE HAD COMPLETED ALL HIS CALCULATIONS ABOUT NERINA BUT THAT PERFIDIOUS SATELLITE HAD TOTALLY DISAPPEARED
IT WAS PART OF HIS CHARACTER TO DISCOVER THE WHY AND THE WHEREFORE OF EVERYTHING THAT CAME UNDER HIS OBSERVATION AND HE WOULD HAVE FACED A CANNON BALL THE MORE UNFLINCHINGLY FROM UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC FORCE BY WHICH IT WAS PROPELLED
UPON IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED SOME FRAGMENTS OF THAT AGGLUTINATION OF YELLOW LIMESTONE WHICH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE COAST OF PROVENCE
IT WAS AT LEAST A REFUGE
BEFORE PROCEEDING TO EXPLAIN THIS SOMEWHAT ENIGMATICAL CONDUCT OF SERVADAC IT IS NECESSARY TO REFER TO A CERTAIN PHYSIOLOGICAL FACT COINCIDENT BUT UNCONNECTED WITH CELESTIAL PHENOMENA ORIGINATING ENTIRELY IN THE FRAILTY OF HUMAN NATURE
AND WHAT APPEARS TO ME ALMOST AS REMARKABLE IS THAT WE HAVE NEVER ONCE CAUGHT SIGHT EITHER OF ONE OF THE MALTESE TARTANS OR ONE OF THE LEVANTINE XEBECS THAT TRAFFIC SO REGULARLY ON THE MEDITERRANEAN EASTWARDS OR WESTWARDS ASKED THE COUNT--"WHICH SHALL BE OUR COURSE
HAPPIER AND BETTER PROVIDED FOR THAN THEY HAD EVER BEEN IN THEIR LIVES IT DID NOT GIVE THEM A PASSING THOUGHT FAR LESS CAUSE ANY SERIOUS CONCERN WHETHER THEY WERE STILL CIRCLING ROUND THE SUN OR WHETHER THEY WERE BEING CARRIED RIGHT AWAY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF ANOTHER SYSTEM
THE READINGS AROUND THE LONG TABLE CEASED TO BE ATTRACTIVE AND THE DEBATES SUSTAINED BY FEW BECAME UTTERLY WANTING IN ANIMATION
THE LOWER THEY WENT THE GREATER WAS THE DIMINUTION IN THE COLD A DIMINUTION THAT WAS FAR MORE RAPID THAN THAT WHICH IS EXPERIENCED IN MAKING THE DESCENT OF TERRESTRIAL MINES
FROM THAT COMMISSION THE NAME OF PALMYRIN ROSETTE WAS OMITTED APPARENTLY FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN HIS PERSONAL UNPOPULARITY
BUT WHAT HE FELT MORE THAN ANYTHING WAS THE WANT OF SOME RETIRED APARTMENT WHERE HE COULD PURSUE HIS STUDIES WITHOUT HINDRANCE OR INTRUSION
THIEF
IT DID NOT JUSTIFY ANY ANTICIPATION THAT GALLIA WOULD MERELY GRAZE THE EARTH AS IT HAD DONE BEFORE
MOREOVER THE ERUPTION HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN OF RECENT ORIGIN DATING PROBABLY ONLY FROM THE SHOCK WHICH HAD INVESTED GALLIA WITH A PROPORTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE EARTH AND BENEATH THE COATING OF ASHES WITH WHICH THEY WERE COVERED THERE WERE VARIOUS IRREGULARITIES IN THE ROCK NOT YET WORN AWAY BY THE ACTION OF THE LAVA AND THESE AFFORDED A TOLERABLY SAFE FOOTING
AND IN COMPLIMENT TO THE LITTLE ITALIAN IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY VOTED BY THE COLONY THAT THEIR NEW HOME SHOULD BE CALLED NINA'S HIVE THE FIRST CARE OF CAPTAIN SERVADAC WAS TO ASCERTAIN HOW HE COULD MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE USE OF THE HEAT WHICH NATURE HAD PROVIDED FOR THEM SO OPPORTUNELY AND WITH SO LAVISH A HAND
HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BEN ZOOF AND TWO RUSSIAN SAILORS
BUT SUDDENLY BETHINKING HIMSELF HE ADDED
SERVADAC TIMASCHEFF AND PROCOPE WERE QUICKLY ROWED ASHORE AND LOST NO TIME IN COMMENCING THEIR ASCENT OF THE STEEP ACCLIVITY
OUR GALLIA IS CERTAIN TO BE FAR MORE THAN A MERE OBJECT OF SCIENTIFIC INTEREST OR CURIOSITY
BUT THE EMERGENCY WAS GREAT AND IT WAS ACCORDINGLY SOON DECIDED THAT THE LITTLE COLONY SHOULD FORTHWITH TAKE UP ITS QUARTERS IN THE CAVE
WHAT CAN THIS BE SOLILOQUIZED THE CAPTAIN
ALTHOUGH PROFESSOR ROSETTE YIELDED TO THE PRESSURE OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE CONDUCTED TO THE LOWER REGIONS NOTHING WOULD INDUCE HIM TO ALLOW HIS TELESCOPE TO BE CARRIED UNDERGROUND
AND NOT FAR FROM MOSTAGANEM SUCH WERE THE FIRST WORDS WHICH AFTER THEIR RETURN TO CONSCIOUSNESS WERE EXCHANGED BETWEEN SERVADAC AND HIS ORDERLY
HAKKABUT SAID THE CAPTAIN PLUNGING WITHOUT FURTHER PREFACE INTO BUSINESS WE WANT SOME COFFEE SOME TOBACCO AND OTHER THINGS
YES I THINK IT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED HE REPEATED
OF THE LEFT BANK THERE WAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST TRACE AND THE RIGHT BANK WHICH ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HAD BOUNDED THE YELLOW STREAM AS IT MURMURED PEACEFULLY ALONG THE FERTILE PLAIN HAD NOW BECOME THE SHORE OF A TUMULTUOUS OCEAN ITS AZURE WATERS EXTENDING WESTWARDS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH AND ANNIHILATING THE TRACT OF COUNTRY WHICH HAD HITHERTO FORMED THE DISTRICT OF MOSTAGANEM
YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALGERIA AS YOU IMAGINED THE LIEUTENANT SHOOK HIS HEAD
THAT HE TRAVELS AT THE RATE OF 467 MILES A MINUTE ALONG AN ORBIT MEASURING 2,976 MILLIONS OF MILES
THE PROFESSOR POCKETED HIS FRENCH COINS WITH A SATISFACTION FAR MORE DEMONSTRATIVE
IT IS THE 266TH DAY OF THE GALLIAN YEAR
WHEN ALONE THEY WOULD FREQUENTLY ASK EACH OTHER WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THEM ALL IF THE VOLCANIC HEAT SHOULD REALLY BE SUBSIDING OR IF SOME UNEXPECTED PERTURBATION SHOULD RETARD THE COURSE OF THE COMET AND COMPEL THEM TO AN INDEFINITELY PROLONGED RESIDENCE IN THEIR GRIM ABODE
BULLOCKS COWS GOATS AND SHEEP EXISTED IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS
FEARFUL OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD ATTEND THE DESCENT OF HIS SERVANT TO TERRA FIRMA SERVADAC BOUNDED FORWARDS TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DITCH IN TIME TO BREAK HIS FALL
I WILL HAVE THEM SHOUTED THE PROFESSOR
WHY IF THE NEW LAND IS A FRAGMENT OF THE OLD--WHY DOES IT NOT RETAIN ITS OLD FORMATION
YES INDEED GROANED HAKKABUT AND NOW I REQUIRE SOME FOR MY OWN USE
OH YES OF COURSE PABLO WILL GO
LET HIM IN I SAY REPEATED THE CAPTAIN PEREMPTORILY
BUT HER ORBIT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE DERANGED AND IF WE SURVIVE THE SHOCK WE SHALL HAVE SMALL CHANCE OF EVER RETURNING TO THE WORLD OF OUR FELLOW-CREATURES PROFESSOR ROSETTE I SUPPOSE BEN ZOOF REMARKED WOULD PRETTY SOON FIND OUT ALL ABOUT THAT BUT WE WILL LEAVE THIS HYPOTHESIS SAID THE LIEUTENANT
CAPTAIN SERVADAC WHO ACCOMPANIES ME CONTINUED THE COUNT HAS BEEN MOST SEVERELY TRIED BY THE DISASTER
A FINE PIECE OF BUSINESS WE HAVE MADE OF THIS SAID BEN ZOOF WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE WITH HIS MASTER
WELL CAPTAIN SAID BEN ZOOF PRESENTLY SUCH BEING HIS ORDINARY WAY OF OPENING CONVERSATION
EVERYONE HOWEVER APPROVED OF ALL THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS OF NINA'S HIVE AND WERE PROFUSE IN THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF SATISFACTION AT FINDING THEMSELVES LOCATED IN SUCH COMFORTABLE QUARTERS
IT WAS RESOLVED TO PROCEED UPON THE SAME PLAN AS HERETOFORE FOLLOWING THE BOUNDARY OF THE LAND AT A SAFE DISTANCE
BUT WELL MUFFLED UP IN FUR THEY ALL ENDURED IT WITHOUT MUCH ACTUAL SUFFERING
AND ALMOST UNCONSCIOUS AS THE HALF-DORMANT POPULATION OF GALLIA WERE OF HER INFLUENCE THEY STILL WOULD HAVE MISSED HER BRIGHT PRESENCE SORELY
YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THE TOTAL OF PEOPLE ON THE ISLAND IS DOUBLE THAT
SERVADAC LOOKED BEWILDERED
OF THE PRESENT DISTANCE OF GALLIA FROM THE SUN AND THE NUMBER OF LEAGUES SHE HAD TRAVERSED SINCE THE RECEIPT OF THE LAST MYSTERIOUS DOCUMENT THERE WERE NO MEANS OF JUDGING
NOW GENTLEMEN HE BEGAN HAUGHTILY PERMIT ME TO REPRESENT THAT IN SPITE OF ANY LOSS FRANCE MAY HAVE SUSTAINED IN THE FATE OF ALGERIA FRANCE IS READY TO ANSWER ANY PROVOCATION THAT AFFECTS HER HONOR
IT WAS TRUE THAT WITH THE RETURN OF SUMMER TEMPERATURE THERE WOULD BE CERTAIN TO BE A DERANGEMENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF GALLIA WHICH WOULD RESULT IN WIND BUT FOR THE PRESENT THE AIR WAS ALTOGETHER TOO STILL FOR THE YAWL TO HAVE ANY PROSPECTS OF MAKING ITS WAY TO GIBRALTAR
COME WAKE UP SAID SERVADAC SHAKING HIM BY THE SHOULDER
WE HAVE NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER SAID THE ORDERLY
SHE IS A CHARMING LITTLE CREATURE
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT HECTOR SERVADAC SHOULD NOT HAVE CONFIDED TO THE COUNT A PROJECT WHICH WILD AS IT WAS COULD SCARCELY HAVE FAILED TO WIDEN THE UNACKNOWLEDGED BREACH THAT WAS OPENING IN THEIR FRIENDSHIP
THE ROCKS THAT RESTED AT THE BOTTOM--JUST AS THOSE WHICH FORMED ITS SIDES--WERE OF THE SAME LAMELLOUS FORMATION AS THE ENTIRE COAST AND HAD NOT HITHERTO BEEN SUBJECT TO THE DISAGGREGATION WHICH THE LAPSE OF TIME NEVER FAILS TO WORK
BUT WHAT STRUCK THE EXPLORERS MORE THAN ANYTHING WAS THE APPEARANCE OF SINGULAR NEWNESS THAT PERVADED THE WHOLE OF THE REGION
AND ESPECIALLY IN MY CASE WHEN I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION OF BEING WOUNDED AT ALL INCREDULOUS AS THEY NATURALLY WERE AS TO THE ASSIGNED CAUSE OF THE QUARREL SERVADAC'S FRIENDS HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO ACCEPT HIS EXPLANATION AND WITHOUT FARTHER PARLEY THEY STARTED FOR THE STAFF OFFICE WHERE AT TWO O'CLOCK PRECISELY THEY WERE TO MEET THE SECONDS OF COUNT TIMASCHEFF
I CAN SEE AN ERECTION OF SOME KIND QUITE DISTINCTLY
THE YAWL WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET LONG AND CAPABLE OF HOLDING FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE
AND SERVADAC'S IRRITATION AND ANNOYANCE AT BEING UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY ONE POINT OF THE FIRMAMENT MAY BE MORE READILY IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED
NEGRETE AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD MEANWHILE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM TWO ENGLISH OFFICERS FROM GIBRALTAR
COME IN
COME IN
IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT MAJOR OLIPHANT HAD NOT BEEN CONVINCED OF THE TRUTH OF ONE SYLLABLE OF WHAT HE HAD BEEN SAYING
AND THIS IS COLONEL HENEAGE FINCH MURPHY WAS THE MAJOR'S GRAVE REJOINDER
IN THIS CASE IT WAS A VOLCANO NOT A COLLIERY THAT WAS THE OBJECT OF EXPLORATION AND THANKFUL ENOUGH THEY WERE TO FIND THAT IT HAD NOT BECOME EXTINCT
BUT IT REQUIRED NO VERY KEEN DISCRIMINATION TO OBSERVE THAT ALL ALONG THERE WAS A LURKING GLEAM OF SATISFACTION IN HIS LITTLE GRAY EYES AND WHEN A FEW HOURS LATER HE FOUND HIMSELF SECURELY ANCHORED AND HIS PROPERTY IN A PLACE OF SAFETY HE QUITE CHUCKLED WITH GLEE
THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT OF COLDER AND LESS DEMONSTRATIVE TEMPERAMENT ALIKE SEEMED TO REALIZE THE POSSIBLE PERILS OF THE UNDERTAKING BUT EVEN THEY WERE DETERMINED TO PUT A BOLD FACE UPON EVERY DIFFICULTY
THE MOON IN THE WEST HE CRIED ALOUD
AND THE DEPREDATORS FELL BY DOZENS ON EITHER HAND
CONSTANT EVER I WILL BE CONSTANT NO CLOSING LINES WERE UTTERED
I SHALL BE GRATEFUL HANG YOUR GRATITUDE ONLY ONE POUND
WHEN HE HAD BEEN PARTIALLY DIVESTED OF HIS CLOTHING HIS HEART WAS FOUND TO BE STILL BEATING THOUGH VERY FEEBLY
WELL SEVEN OR THEREABOUTS--THEREABOUTS STAMMERED THE JEW WITH CONSIDERABLE HESITATION
THAT ON THE 1ST OF FEBRUARY IT PASSED ITS DESCENDING NODE
THEN GENTLEMEN SAID THE ASTRONOMER WITH YOUR LEAVE WE WILL FOR THIS PURPOSE MAKE AN APPOINTMENT A FEW WEEKS HENCE
THE ROCK HARD AS ADAMANT NEVER FAILED TO REVEAL ITSELF WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND
IT IS MY RIGHT
AGAIN AND AGAIN THE LIEUTENANT ASKED HIMSELF WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HIM AND HIS COMRADES EVEN IF THEY SHOULD SURVIVE THE PERIL OF SHIPWRECK AND GAIN A FOOTING UPON THE CLIFF
BUT THEY DID NOT COMPLAIN
PROCOPE'S CONJECTURE PROVED CORRECT
BEN ZOOF HAS HIT THE RIGHT NAIL ON THE HEAD
MANY OF THEM MOREOVER WE HAVE LEARNED FROM DOCUMENTS WHICH WE HAVE PICKED UP AND WHICH ALTHOUGH UNSIGNED WE CANNOT ENTERTAIN A DOUBT HAVE ORIGINATED WITH YOU PROFESSOR ROSETTE DREW HIMSELF UP PROUDLY AND SAID
BUT THAT JEW IS A RASCAL CHAPTER XV
BUT HE WAS STILL MORE SURPRISED WHEN HE SAW THAT BEFORE THE WATER HAD BEEN TWO MINUTES OVER THE FIRE IT WAS AT FULL BOIL
ON THE 16TH THE DOBRYNA ESSAYED TO START UPON HER ALTERED WAY BUT IT SEEMED AS IF THE ELEMENTS HAD CONSPIRED TO OBSTRUCT HER PROGRESS
I HOPE YOU HAVE IMPROVED QUITE A REFORMED CHARACTER SIR I ASSURE YOU SAID SERVADAC SMILING
HE WAS AVOWEDLY FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF ARAGO WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED ALWAYS IN LECTURING TO WATCH THE COUNTENANCE OF THE LEAST INTELLIGENT OF HIS AUDIENCE AND WHEN HE FELT THAT HE HAD MADE HIS MEANING CLEAR TO HIM HE CONCLUDED THAT HE MUST HAVE SUCCEEDED WITH ALL THE REST
WHAT OUR FRIEND THE PROFESSOR HAS DONE HERE HAS BEEN DONE LIKEWISE ON THE EARTH WHERE BEYOND A QUESTION ALL MANNER OF EXPEDIENTS ARE BEING DISCUSSED AS TO THE BEST WAY OF MITIGATING THE VIOLENCE OF A CONCUSSION THAT MUST OCCUR THE LIEUTENANT'S CONJECTURES WERE SO REASONABLE THAT THEY COMMANDED ASSENT
WOULD THAT THOSE CLOUDS WOULD DISCLOSE WHAT ENORMOUS LUMINARY LIES BEHIND THEM
BESIDES AS WE PASS GOURBI ISLAND WE MIGHT TAKE BEN ZOOF ON BOARD AND THEN MAKE AWAY FOR GIBRALTAR WHERE WE SHOULD BE SURE TO LEARN SOMETHING AT LEAST OF EUROPEAN NEWS WITH HIS USUAL AIR OF STATELY COURTESY COUNT TIMASCHEFF BEGGED THE CAPTAIN TO CONSIDER THE YACHT AT HIS OWN DISPOSAL AND DESIRED HIM TO GIVE THE LIEUTENANT INSTRUCTIONS ACCORDINGLY
WHAT HE BEGAN TO ASK HIMSELF--WHAT IF ALL THAT WAS TOLD HIM WAS TRUE
TELL ME WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN NO MY FRIEND EXCUSE ME REPLIED SERVADAC
78,000,000 L
IT WAS SCARCELY LIKELY THAT HE WOULD CARE TO COME BUT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS FELT TO BE ADVISABLE TO ASK HIM
NO DOUBT WE ARE IN FOR A TWO YEARS EXCURSION BUT FIFTEEN MONTHS MORE WILL TAKE US BACK TO THE EARTH AND WE SHALL SEE MONTMARTRE AGAIN EXCLAIMED BEN ZOOF IN EXCITED TONES THAT BETRAYED HIS DELIGHT IN THE ANTICIPATION
BUT HERE ALL WAS BARE AND BLANK AND DESOLATE--NOT A SYMPTOM OF VITALITY WAS VISIBLE
MY MEN I CAN ANSWER FOR IT ARE QUITE PREPARED TO RECOGNIZE YOU AS THEIR SUPERIOR OFFICER MOST UNHESITATINGLY REPLIED SERVADAC I ACCEPT THE POST WITH ALL ITS RESPONSIBILITIES
ASTOUNDING SIR HE EXCLAIMED
BEDS FURNITURE COOKING UTENSILS--FIRST THE STORES OF THE DOBRYNA THEN THE CARGO OF THE TARTAN--ALL WERE CARRIED DOWN WITH THE GREATEST ALACRITY AND THE DIMINISHED WEIGHT COMBINED WITH THE DOWNHILL ROUTE TO MAKE THE LABOR PROCEED WITH INCREDIBLE BRISKNESS
IT LEFT IT CERTAIN THAT THE TWO BODIES WOULD INEVITABLY IMPINGE
INDULGED AND LOVED BY ALL IT WAS LITTLE WONDER THAT YOUNG PABLO HAD NO LONGING FOR THE SCORCHING PLAINS OF ANDALUSIA OR THAT LITTLE NINA HAD LOST ALL WISH TO RETURN WITH HER PET GOAT TO THE BARREN ROCKS OF SARDINIA
SOME CRITICS INDEED HAVE POINTED TO THIS WORK AS MARKING THE BEGINNING OF A DECLINE IN THE AUTHOR'S POWER OF AWAKING INTEREST
HAKKABUT BEGAN MAKING A GREAT HUBBUB WHEN HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE BURNING SOME OF THE SPARS OF THE HANSA
FIRST OF ALL PERMIT ME TO EXPRESS MY SURPRISE AT SEEING YOU HERE
WE CAN LAND AT LAST COUNT TIMASCHEFF AND THE LIEUTENANT WERE SCARCELY LESS IMPATIENT THAN THE CAPTAIN AND LITTLE NEEDED HIS URGENT AND REPEATED SOLICITATIONS
IMPOSSIBLE TO SLEEP IN SUCH A NOISE AND HE GAVE VENT TO A LOUD GROAN
BY THE NAME OF A KABYLE HE BROKE OUT IMPATIENTLY HIS EXCELLENCY IS GROSSLY NEGLIGENT ALTHOUGH THE DAYS AND NIGHTS HAD BECOME REDUCED FROM TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TO TWELVE CAPTAIN SERVADAC WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE NEW CONDITION OF THINGS BUT RESOLVED TO ADHERE TO THE COMPUTATIONS OF THE OLD CALENDAR
THEIR MOON WAS IN CONJUNCTION AND WOULD NOT BE SEEN
THE COUNT WAS HIMSELF VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE HIS SHARE IN THE PHILANTHROPIC ENTERPRISE AND DEMURRED CONSIDERABLY TO THE PROPOSAL
THERE WAS NONE OF THE WILD DISORDER AND DEAFENING TUMULT THAT USUALLY ACCOMPANY THE DISCHARGE OF VOLCANIC MATTER BUT THE HEATED LAVA RISING WITH A UNIFORM GENTLENESS QUIETLY OVERRAN THE LIMITS OF THE CRATER LIKE THE FLOW OF WATER FROM THE BOSOM OF A PEACEFUL LAKE
THE DEVASTATION IS NOT LIMITED TO AFRICA OBSERVED THE COUNT
MY COMET MY COMET SAID THE VOICE SO LOW AS TO BE ALMOST INAUDIBLE AND THE UNFORTUNATE MAN RELAPSED AGAIN INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS
TO THE NORTH NOTHING BUT ONE DREAR INHOSPITABLE STRETCH
IN APPEARANCE HECTOR SERVADAC WAS QUITE THE TYPE OF AN OFFICER
BUT THE INTENSE COLD PERPETUALLY COMPELLED HIM TO DESIST OR HE WOULD LITERALLY HAVE BEEN FROZEN TO DEATH
THE MOON AGAIN HE CRIED
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT OH MY LORD MY LORD WHINED ISAAC YOU MUST HAVE SOME NEWS TO TELL ME NEWS
IT FAILS AND FAILS COMPLETELY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE GEOLOGICAL CHARACTER OF THE LAND THAT WE HAVE FOUND NOW ENCOMPASSING THIS SEA
NO ALTERNATIVE THEREFORE REMAINED THAN TO TAKE A WESTERLY COURSE AND TO ATTEMPT TO REACH THE NORTHERN SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
BUT AN EVENT SOON AFTERWARDS OCCURRED WHICH AWAKENED HIS KEENEST INTEREST
HOW STRANGE EXCLAIMED HECTOR SERVADAC THAT AFTER SAILING ALL THIS TIME OVER SEA WHERE WE EXPECTED TO FIND LAND WE HAVE AT LAST COME UPON LAND WHERE WE THOUGHT TO FIND SEA STRANGE INDEED REPLIED LIEUTENANT PROCOPE
HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAD TRANSPIRED
UNABLE INDEED THE GALLIANS WERE TO REALIZE ALL THE MARVELS OF THIS STRANGE WORLD
THAT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY ABOUT ONE-SIXTEENTH OF THE DIAMETER OF THE EARTH RAISING HIS VOICE HE CONTINUED GENTLEMEN IN ORDER TO COMPLETE MY ACCOUNT OF MY COMET GALLIA I REQUIRE TO KNOW ITS AREA ITS MASS ITS VOLUME ITS DENSITY ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY SINCE WE KNOW THE DIAMETER REMARKED THE LIEUTENANT THERE CAN BE NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING ITS SURFACE AND ITS VOLUME AND DID I SAY THERE WAS ANY DIFFICULTY ASKED THE PROFESSOR FIERCELY
I WONDER WHETHER THESE CALCULATIONS WERE MADE BEFORE OR AFTER THE 1ST OF JANUARY
THE VAGABONDS
IT WAS ON THE 1ST OF SEPTEMBER THAT THE COMET HAD CROSSED THE ORBIT OF JUPITER AND ON THE 1ST OF OCTOBER THE TWO BODIES WERE CALCULATED TO BE AT THEIR MINIMUM SEPARATION
BUT THE FREQUENT VOYAGES MADE BY THE DOBRYNA TO THE SOUTH AND THE REPEATED CONSIGNMENTS OF CORN AND CATTLE SOON SERVED TO MAKE HIM AWARE THAT CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE REALLY CONTEMPLATING A DEPARTURE FROM GOURBI ISLAND
CAPE PALOS--ALL WERE GONE
AT SUNRISE ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE 16TH OF APRIL CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND THE LIEUTENANT TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE YAWL
PLENTY--A HUNDRED KILOGRAMMES THEN LET ME HAVE ONE POUND
THOUGH STILL HIDDEN BY HEAVY CLOUDS THE SUN WAS EVIDENTLY DECLINING FAST
ALL VERY WELL FOR TWO ARMIES BUT FOR A COUPLE OF PLANETS NOT QUITE SO SAFE PERHAPS AS YOU MAY IMAGINE
OF THIS ROCK HERE IS A SOLID DECIMETER
ALREADY YOU HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF TRAVERSING A FIELD OF ICE AND I AM SURE THEREFORE YOU WILL ACQUIESCE IN MY WISH TO CONTINUE OUR EXPLORATIONS WHILE THE WATER IS STILL OPEN NO DOUBT YOU ARE RIGHT LIEUTENANT SAID THE COUNT
ONE SPOT ALONE REFUSED TO FREEZE
I HAVE MADE ANOTHER COUPLET
AT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE THE CABIN DOOR OPENED AND THE JEW'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS PROTRUDED ONTO THE DECK
ASSUREDLY NOT ASSENTED THE LIEUTENANT
A CHANGE HAD COME OVER HIS IDEAS
MONTMARTRE CONTINUED BEN ZOOF EAGERLY
THE COMBATANTS WERE SOON PARTED
I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO GIVE CREDIT HE REPEATED
HOW AT INTERVALS THE THREE ANONYMOUS DOCUMENTS HAD BEEN RECEIVED
THE OBJECT HOWEVER OF SUPREME INTEREST WAS THE GREAT EXPANSE OF THE TERRESTRIAL DISC WHICH WAS RAPIDLY DRAWING DOWN OBLIQUELY TOWARDS THEM
BUT WHO SHALL DESCRIBE THE FEELINGS OF HECTOR SERVADAC WHEN INSTEAD OF THE CHARMING OUTLINE OF HIS NATIVE LAND HE BEHELD NOTHING BUT A SOLID BOUNDARY OF SAVAGE ROCK
YES THE SOONER THE BETTER WITH OUR TAILS BETWEEN OUR LEGS REJOINED THE ORDERLY WHO THIS TIME FELT NO INCLINATION TO START OFF TO THE MARCH OF THE ALGERIAN ZEPHYRS
IN FIFTY-ONE DAYS IF PROFESSOR ROSETTE HAS MADE NO ERROR IN HIS CALCULATIONS THERE IS TO BE A RECURRENCE OF COLLISION BETWEEN THIS COMET AND THE EARTH
NO GENTLEMEN I REPEAT IT WE HAVE NOTHING TO REGRET AND AS THE PROFESSOR SPOKE HE SEEMED TO KINDLE WITH THE EMOTION OF SUCH SUPREME CONTENTMENT THAT NO ONE HAD THE HEART TO GAINSAY HIS ASSERTION
THE THIRD WAS WHITE AND BRILLIANT
IT CHEATS
IT WAS NOW ALL-IMPORTANT TO LEARN WHETHER THE ASTRONOMER HAD BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE HIS OBSERVATIONS AND WHETHER HE HAD LEARNED SUFFICIENT OF GALLIA'S PATH THROUGH SPACE TO MAKE HIM COMPETENT TO DETERMINE AT LEAST APPROXIMATELY THE PERIOD OF ITS REVOLUTION ROUND THE SUN
AND SERVADAC WHO FOR THE LAST SIX DAYS HAD CONFINED HIMSELF TO THE SHELTER OF HIS ROOF HASTENED TO JOIN BEN ZOOF AT HIS POST UPON THE CLIFF
ALREADY THE MOST PROTECTED OF THE MANY RAMIFICATIONS OF NINA'S HIVE WERE BEING PERVADED BY A COLD THAT WAS INSUFFERABLE
THAT IS OF NO MOMENT AT ALL REPLIED THE PROFESSOR
THE OLD MAN DARTED AN ANGRY LOOK AT HIM THROUGH THE SPECTACLES AND SAID SHARPLY SERVADAC FIVE HUNDRED LINES TO-MORROW IT WAS AN ECHO OF DAYS OF OLD
SERVICE TWO YEARS AT SCHOOL AT ST CYR
IT IS THE TWENTIETH ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN
THEY MIGHT RATHER BE DESCRIBED AS LONG UNDULATIONS CARRYING THE SCHOONER ITS WEIGHT DIMINISHED FROM THE SAME CAUSE AS THAT OF THE WATER ALTERNATELY TO SUCH HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS THAT IF CAPTAIN SERVADAC HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO SEASICKNESS HE MUST HAVE FOUND HIMSELF IN SORRY PLIGHT
I WILL PAY YOU HONESTLY
THE OBSERVATIONS CONTRADICTED THE CALCULATIONS
THAT ANOTHER MOVES ROUND ITS PRIMARY AT AN INTERVAL ABOUT EQUAL TO THE MOON'S DISTANCE FROM OURSELVES
MY FRIENDS EXCEPT FROM COLD WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR
PRUSSIA A FORMIDABLE HATCHET IMBEDDED IN THE HEART OF GERMANY ITS EDGE JUST GRAZING THE FRONTIERS OF FRANCE
THE OFFICERS HAD A SERVANT NAMED KIRKE AND A COMPANY OF TEN SOLDIERS OF THE LINE
YET IT WAS NEITHER MERCURY NOR VENUS BECAUSE NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER OF THESE HAS ANY SATELLITE AT ALL
HELP
WE SHALL SOON FIND A REGULAR STOVE ONWARDS THEY MADE THEIR WAY UNTIL AT LAST A SHARP TURN BROUGHT THEM INTO A SUDDEN FLOOD OF LIGHT
IT WAS DIRECTED
WE SHALL MEET AGAIN SAID SERVADAC AS THEY PUSHED OFF FROM SHORE
IN SPITE HOWEVER OF THE CONTINUAL DOWNFALL THE HEAVENS STILL REMAINED VEILED IN CLOUD
WHO KNOWS HE SAID TO HIMSELF WHETHER CEUTA ON ITS RETURN TO EARTH MAY NOT OCCUPY A GRAND AND COMMANDING SITUATION
COULD THE PROFESSOR THROW ANY LIGHT UPON THAT
VERY SLIGHT HOWEVER IN COMPARISON WAS THE REGARD WHICH THESE ASTRONOMICAL WONDERS ATTRACTED ON BOARD THE DOBRYNA
SOUNDINGS WERE MADE AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT INVARIABLY WITH THE SAME RESULT
IT STILL CONTAINED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF TOOLS SUCH AS MATTOCKS SHOVELS AND PICK-AXES
THESE WERE SPEEDILY DEVOURED BUT WERE ALTOGETHER INADEQUATE IN QUANTITY TO MEET THE DEMAND
OUR PROVISIONS ARE AMPLE--MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THE REMAINING PERIOD OF OUR SOJOURN IN THIS LONE WORLD OF OURS
HE HAD NOW A STAFF APPOINTMENT AT MOSTAGANEM AND HAD LATELY BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH SOME TOPOGRAPHICAL WORK ON THE COAST BETWEEN TENES AND THE SHELIF
THE WIND WAS STILL BLOWING HARD FROM THE SOUTH AND ASSUMING THAT THE YAWL COULD BE PROPELLED WITH A VELOCITY OF ABOUT FIFTEEN OR AT LEAST TWELVE LEAGUES AN HOUR HE RECKONED THAT IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE TO REACH FORMENTERA WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THAT IS TO SAY IN A SINGLE DAY BETWEEN THE INTERVALS OF SUNRISE AND SUNRISE
AND AFTER ALL YOU KNOW A SWORD-CUT NEED NOT BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR CERTAINLY NOT REJOINED SERVADAC
I HAVE SOMETHING ON MY MIND HE SAID
NEARLY THE WHOLE OF HIS TIME HOWEVER HE INFORMED CAPTAIN SERVADAC HAD BEEN SPENT UPON THE SEA HIS REAL BUSINESS BEING THAT OF A MERCHANT TRADING AT ALL THE PORTS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
BUT IN THE MIDST OF THEIR PERPLEXITY WHAT SOUND WAS THAT WHICH STARTLED THEM
EMPTY WORDS CANNOT CONVEY ALL A LOVER'S HEART WOULD SAY WELL TO BE SURE HE IS AT HIS EVERLASTING VERSES AGAIN SAID BEN ZOOF TO HIMSELF AS HE ROUSED HIMSELF IN HIS CORNER
AS SOON AS HE RECOVERED HIS POWER OF ARTICULATION ISAAC BEGAN TO POUR OUT A MEDLEY OF LAMENTATIONS AND PETITIONS FOR MERCY
ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT IN SOMEWHAT MORE SCIENTIFIC TERMS I WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION
YOU WILL NOT HURT ME WILL YOU HURT YOU MY CHILD ANSWERED SERVADAC
THE PROFESSOR HOWEVER HAD ASCERTAINED ALL THAT HE WANTED TO KNOW
GOD OF ISRAEL HE SAID IN AN UNDERTONE THEY HAVE MADE NO CHARGE
ONLY GIVE THEM A GUITAR AND THEIR CASTANETS AND THEY WILL SOON FORGET ALL CARE AND ANXIETY
SILENCE SERVADAC WAS DISPOSED TO APPEASE THE OLD MAN'S ANXIETY BY PROMISING TO SEE THAT JUSTICE WAS ULTIMATELY DONE
BENEATH THIS COULD BE PACKED A SUPPLY OF PROVISIONS SOME WARM FURS SOME CORDIALS AND A PORTABLE STOVE TO BE HEATED BY SPIRITS OF WINE
OUR OWN EXPERIENCE HAS SUFFICIENTLY SHOWN US ITS ADVANTAGES AND ITS DISADVANTAGES
BUT HE DECLINED ON THE PLEA OF TAKING NO INTEREST IN THE MATTER
WHICH SAID THE MAN
WELL YOU SEE--YOU SEE YOUR EXCELLENCY STAMMERED OUT THE JEW TO GIVE CREDIT TO ONE WOULDN'T DO UNLESS I GAVE CREDIT TO ANOTHER
BUT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF INTERFERING WHEN THE COLONEL IN A GREATLY SUBDUED TONE BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK
AT A LATITUDE CORRESPONDING WITH THE LATITUDE OF ROME THE SEA TOOK THE FORM OF A DEEP GULF EXTENDING BACK FAR BEYOND THE SITE OF THE ETERNAL CITY
AN UNIMPORTANT MINORITY DECLARED THEMSELVES IN HIS FAVOR AND A PAMPHLET OBTAINED SOME DEGREE OF NOTICE RIDICULING THE WHOLE DEBATE UNDER THE TITLE OF THE HISTORY OF AN HYPOTHESIS IN REPLY TO THIS IMPERTINENT CRITICISM OF HIS LABORS ROSETTE ISSUED A REJOINDER FULL WITH THE MOST VEHEMENT EXPRESSIONS OF INDIGNATION AND REITERATING HIS ASSEVERATION THAT A FRAGMENT OF GIBRALTAR WAS STILL TRAVERSING THE REGIONS OF SPACE CARRYING THIRTEEN ENGLISHMEN UPON ITS SURFACE AND CONCLUDING BY SAYING THAT IT WAS THE GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT OF HIS LIFE THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN WITH THEM
PALMYRIN ROSETTE WOULD DOUBTLESS CONFIRM THEIR SOLUTION OF THE PHENOMENON
THE DEMONSTRATION WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMPLETE THAT THE ORBIT OF GALLIA DID NOT COINCIDE WITH THAT OF THE PLANET THE ORBIT OF JUPITER BEING INCLINED AT AN ANGLE OF 1 DEGREES 19 MINS TO THE ORBIT OF THE EARTH WITH WHICH THAT OF GALLIA WAS NO DOUBT COINCIDENT
TO SPAIN DO YOU SAY ASKED SERVADAC
THE HEALTH OF THE GOVERNOR GENERAL WAS DRUNK AS WELL AS THE TOAST SUCCESS TO HIS COUNCIL TO WHICH BEN ZOOF WAS CALLED UPON TO RETURN THANKS
AND THE SITE OF THE TOMB OF SAINT LOUIS ON THE COAST OF TUNIS
THAT IS TO SAY IF THERE IS TO BE A TO-MORROW
SURELY THEY SUGGESTED THE MATTER MIGHT BE EASILY ARRANGED
WHAT'S THE MATTER MASTER ISAAC
UNLESS I MISTAKE YOU YOUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT A FRAGMENT OF THE EARTH COMPRISING THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ITS SHORES FROM GIBRALTAR TO MALTA HAS BEEN DEVELOPED INTO A NEW ASTEROID WHICH IS STARTED ON AN INDEPENDENT ORBIT IN THE SOLAR REGIONS
WITHIN AN HOUR WE MUST GO TO PIECES UPON YONDER ROCKS LET US THEN COMMEND OURSELVES TO THE PROVIDENCE OF HIM TO WHOM NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE REPLIED THE COUNT IN A CALM CLEAR VOICE THAT COULD BE DISTINCTLY HEARD BY ALL
PIRATES
MY MONEY
AT NIGHT-TIME WHEN THEY SCOUR THE COUNTRY IN HERDS THE CREATURES ARE SOMEWHAT FORMIDABLE BUT SINGLY THEY ARE NO MORE DANGEROUS THAN A DOG
MY DEAR PROFESSOR HE SAID SMILING ALLOW ME TO SETTLE THIS LITTLE MATTER FOR YOU AH
SATURN IS 735 TIMES LARGER THAN THE EARTH CONSEQUENTLY HE IS SMALLER THAN JUPITER
THIS IS THE WAY THEY BEGAN
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE VESSEL SEEMING THUS INEVITABLE LIEUTENANT PROCOPE TOOK THE BEST MEASURES HE COULD TO INSURE A FEW DAYS SUPPLY OF FOOD FOR ANY WHO MIGHT ESCAPE ASHORE
FOR ALREADY IN MANY PLACES THIN LAYERS OF SNOW WERE GLITTERING UPON THE SURFACE OF THE FRACTURED ROCKS AND THE HIGHER THE ELEVATION THAT WAS GAINED THE MORE THESE LAYERS WERE FOUND TO INCREASE IN AREA AND IN DEPTH
HOWEVER CONFIDENT EVERYONE UPON THE ISLAND MIGHT PROFESS TO BE THAT SUCCOR WOULD BE SENT THEM FROM THEIR NATIVE LAND--FOR BRITAIN NEVER ABANDONS ANY OF HER SONS--IT COULD NOT BE DISGUISED THAT THAT SUCCOR WAS SOMEWHAT TARDY IN MAKING ITS APPEARANCE
FOR HOWEVER FAR OUR LITTLE WORLD MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE SUN I DO NOT SEE WHY ITS TEMPERATURE SHOULD FALL BELOW WHAT PREVAILS IN THOSE OUTLYING REGIONS BEYOND OUR SYSTEM WHERE SKY AND AIR ARE NOT AND WHAT TEMPERATURE MAY THAT BE INQUIRED THE CAPTAIN WITH A SHUDDER
AND BEN ZOOF CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IN FUTURE HE MUST BE CAREFUL TO COMMENCE HIS CULINARY OPERATIONS AN HOUR EARLIER
AND IT IS TO THIS COMET THAT OUR SCIENTIFIC FRIEND HERE HAS GIVEN THE NAME OF GALLIA IT STILL REMAINED A PUZZLE TO THEM ALL WHY THE ASTRONOMER SHOULD APPARENTLY BE INTERESTED IN THE COMET SO MUCH MORE THAN IN THE NEW LITTLE WORLD IN WHICH THEIR STRANGE LOT WAS CAST
THE FRAGMENT INCLUDED CEUTA AND GIBRALTAR WITH THE TWO ENGLISH GARRISONS
IF THE COMET WERE OF SUCH ATTENUATION SUCH ALMOST INFINITESIMAL MASS AS SOME OF THESE CELESTIAL WANDERERS SEEM TO BE WE CAN IMAGINE OUR EARTH SELF-PROTECTIVE AND POSSIBLY UNHARMED
CAPTURED PROBABLY BY SOME LARGER BODY IT WAS REVOLVING IN ITS PROPER ZONE OF THE MINOR PLANETS
AS THE REASON OF HIS OPINION HE ALLEGED THAT THE COMBUSTION OF THE ERUPTIVE MATTER WAS MOST PROBABLY OF QUITE RECENT ORIGIN BECAUSE THE COMET BEFORE ITS COLLISION WITH THE EARTH HAD POSSESSED NO ATMOSPHERE AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY NO OXYGEN COULD HAVE PENETRATED TO ITS INTERIOR
ENGLAND CAN AFFORD IT A BUZZ OF APPROVAL BURST INVOLUNTARILY FROM ALL THE MEN BUT MILITARY DISCIPLINE AND THE RESPECT DUE TO THEIR OFFICERS KEPT THEM IN CHECK FROM ANY BOISTEROUS DEMONSTRATION OF THEIR SATISFACTION
HIGHLY DELIGHTED AT HIS MASTER'S DECISION BEN ZOOF EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION AT THE PROSPECT OF STRETCHING HIS LEGS A BIT DECLARING THAT NOTHING COULD INDUCE HIM TO PERMIT THE CAPTAIN TO GO ALONE
EAT AND DRINK IT ALL IF YOU CAN
UTTERLY CARELESS OF THE FUTURE THE MAJOS LIGHT-HEARTED AS EVER CAROLLED OUT THEIR FAVORITE SONGS JUST AS IF THEY HAD NEVER QUITTED THE SHORES OF THEIR NATIVE LAND
ISN'T IT SO
BUT NO LONGER NOW COULD SERVADAC REGARD HIM IN THE LIGHT OF AN ADVERSARY
AND TURNING TO COUNT TIMASCHEFF HE ADDED IN RUSSIAN
AND THEY HAD ASCERTAINED BEYOND A DOUBT THAT THEY WERE THE SOLE HUMAN INHABITANTS LEFT UPON THE ISLAND
STILL RELUCTANT AS I AM TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT I CONFESS THAT I FEEL OUR SOLE HOPE OF SAFETY RESTS IN OUR GETTING FREE FROM THIS COMET IF THE CHANCES WERE TEN THOUSAND TO ONE AGAINST US SAID SERVADAC I THINK THE ATTEMPT OUGHT TO BE MADE BUT HAVE WE HYDROGEN ENOUGH TO INFLATE A BALLOON ASKED THE COUNT
CONSEQUENTLY ALL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE REST OF THE INHABITANTS WAS ENTIRELY CONFINED TO BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED THAT SOME PURCHASE SHOULD BE MADE FROM HIS STOCK OF COMMODITIES
CONSEQUENTLY GALLIA BEING OF SUPERIOR VOLUME MIGHT BE SUPPOSED CAPABLE OF EXERCISING A POWER OF ATTRACTION UPON ANY OF THESE MINIATURE MICROCOSMS
BY THE 25TH VENUS WAS SUFFICIENTLY REMOTE TO PRECLUDE ANY FURTHER FEAR OF COLLISION
HOW SO
WHEAT AND MAIZE SPROUTED AND RIPENED AS IF BY MAGIC AND FOR A WHILE A RANK AND LUXURIANT PASTURAGE CLOTHED THE MEADOWS
EVERYTHING WENT ON WITH THEM IN AN ACCUSTOMED ROUTINE
LONG FITS OF DROWSINESS COMBINED WITH AN UTTER AVERSION TO FOOD WOULD COME OVER THEM
THE SHORE WAS CLOSE AT HAND
THERE WERE INDEED ALL THE SIGNS OF A COMING STORM BUT THE VAPOR ON ACCOUNT OF THE INSUFFICIENT CONDENSATION FAILED TO FALL
TWO STOUT ARMS AN IRON CONSTITUTION A POWERFUL FRAME AND AN INDOMITABLE COURAGE WERE ALL LOYALLY DEVOTED TO HIS MASTER'S SERVICE AND FAIRLY ENTITLED HIM TO HIS SOI-DISANT DESIGNATION OF THE RAMPART OF MONTMARTRE UNLIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING ENCYCLOPAEDIA
AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY DISCUSSED THESE QUESTIONS
ALL EXPECTATIONS OF HAILING A VESSEL BEARING NEWS FROM EUROPE WERE ENTIRELY FALSIFIED SO THAT MORE AND MORE EACH MEMBER OF THE CREW BEGAN TO BE CONSCIOUS OF HIS ISOLATION AND TO BELIEVE THAT THE SCHOONER LIKE A SECOND NOAH'S ARK CARRIED THE SOLE SURVIVORS OF A CALAMITY THAT HAD OVERWHELMED THE EARTH
THE JEW ONLY KEPT ON STAMMERING YES--NO--I DON'T KNOW BUT HEEDLESS OF ANY INTERRUPTION THE PROFESSOR CONTINUED FALSE WEIGHTS
AT NIGHTFALL THEY AGAIN ENCAMPED IN A SLIGHT BEND OF THE SHORE AT A POINT WHICH ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HAD FACED THE MOUTH OF THE MINA ONE OF THE LEFT-HAND AFFLUENTS OF THE SHELIF BUT NOW ABSORBED INTO THE NEWLY REVEALED OCEAN
THE ONLY MALCONTENT WAS HAKKABUT
WE WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU AND AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SCRUTINY OF THE PRETTY MAIDEN HE ADDED
ASK HIM WHAT
HE HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH EITHER OF THE TWO
BUT ITS DISC FROM THE EXTREME REMOTENESS WAS PROPORTIONATELY DWARFED
HE FOUND THAT GALLIA HAD RE-CROSSED THE ORBIT OF JUPITER BUT WAS STILL AT THE ENORMOUS DISTANCE OF 197,000,000 LEAGUES FROM THE SUN AND HE RECKONED THAT IN ABOUT FOUR MONTHS IT WOULD HAVE ENTERED THE ZONE OF THE TELESCOPIC PLANETS
BUT NO--THE DESIRE OF GAIN WAS TOO THOROUGHLY INGRAINED INTO HIS HARD NATURE EVER TO BE ERADICATED AND SECURE IN HIS KNOWLEDGE THAT HE WAS UNDER THE PROTECTION OF A FRENCH OFFICER WHO EXCEPT UNDER THE MOST URGENT NECESSITY WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO BE MOLESTED IN RETAINING HIS PROPERTY HE DETERMINED TO WAIT FOR SOME EMERGENCY TO ARISE WHICH SHOULD ENABLE HIM TO USE HIS PRESENT SITUATION FOR HIS OWN PROFIT
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE A PHILOSOPHER BEN ZOOF HE ASKED
BUT NO THAT CANNOT BE THE MOON
FORTY-SEVEN CRIED PROCOPE
LET HIM ALONE
ON THE SOLE OCCASION WHEN HE HAD VENTURED TO BROACH THE SUBJECT WITH THE ASTRONOMER HE HAD RECEIVED FOR ANSWER THAT AS THERE WAS NO HURRY TO GET BACK TO THE EARTH THERE NEED BE NO CONCERN ABOUT ANY DANGERS OF TRANSIT
HE BEGAN
THE ONLY MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO THROW ANY LIGHT UPON THE SUBJECT WAS LYING AMONGST THEM IN AN UNCONSCIOUS AND HALF-DYING CONDITION
FUEL WAS FAR FROM ABUNDANT
THE STREAM OF BURNING LAVA HAD SUDDENLY CEASED TO FLOW
FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY PASSED WEARILY BY
FIRST OF ALL COUNT HE EXCLAIMED IMPETUOUSLY BEFORE WE SPEAK ONE OTHER WORD TELL ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED THE COUNT WHOSE IMPERTURBABLE COMPOSURE PRESENTED A SINGULAR CONTRAST TO THE FRENCH OFFICER'S ENTHUSIASTIC VIVACITY MADE A STIFF BOW AND IN HIS RUSSIAN ACCENT REPLIED
THE COUNT WHO LIKE MANY RUSSIANS ABROAD WAS AN AIDE-DE-CAMP OF THE CZAR HAD OF COURSE PROPOSED SWORDS AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE WEAPONS AND THE DUEL WAS TO TAKE PLACE ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE FIRST OF JANUARY AT NINE O'CLOCK UPON THE CLIFF AT A SPOT ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE MOUTH OF THE SHELIF
THE CAPTAIN HELD UP HIS FINGER TO HIS ORDERLY MAKING HIM UNDERSTAND THAT HE SHOULD HOLD HIS TONGUE
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE FURTHER REMARKED THAT FROM THE EARTH HE SUPPOSED IT TO BE ABOUT AS CONSPICUOUS AS A STAR OF THE SEVENTH MAGNITUDE AND WOULD REQUIRE A GOOD TELESCOPE TO SEE IT
FOR AS WE ALREADY KNOW THE VOLUME WE CAN DETERMINE THE MASS AS SOON AS WE HAVE ASCERTAINED THE DENSITY THE PROFESSOR TOOK UP THE CUBE OF ROCK
CERTAINLY SAID THE LIEUTENANT
IT WAS MANIFESTLY TIME FOR SERVADAC TO INTERFERE
THE COMET'S DISTANCE WAS SCARCELY THREE TIMES AS GREAT FROM THE SUN AS THE EARTH FROM THE SUN SO THAT THE THERMOMETER RARELY SUNK BEYOND 35 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
AS YET WE CANNOT ASSERT THAT NO OASIS OF THE AFRICAN DESERT HAS ESCAPED THE CATASTROPHE
THE SOUNDING-LEAD BROUGHT UP NOTHING BUT A KIND OF METALLIC DUST WHICH GLITTERED WITH A STRANGE IRIDESCENCE AND THE NATURE OF WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE AS IT WAS TOTALLY UNLIKE WHAT HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO BE RAISED FROM THE BED OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
THREE HOURS AFTER RISING IN THE WEST THE SUN WAS SINKING AGAIN IN THE EAST
WHY SHOULD HE LEAVE THE COMET
THIEVES CAPTAIN
NEITHER OF THEM WAS DAINTY IN THE MATTER EITHER OF BOARD OR LODGING
IT'S ONLY MY LITTLE BIT OF MONEY YOUR EXCELLENCY
IT IS OF NO USE WAITING FOR YOUR PUZZLE-BRAINS TO MAKE IT OUT
CHAPTER V
CHAPTER V
COUNT TIMASCHEFF A RUSSIAN NOBLEMAN WAS EVIDENTLY RICH
THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT BOTH HEARTILY CONCURRED IN SERVADAC'S SENTIMENTS OF HUMANITY AND PRUDENCE AND ALL AGREED THAT IF THE INTERCOURSE WERE TO BE OPENED AT ALL NO TIME COULD BE SO SUITABLE AS THE PRESENT WHILE THE SURFACE OF THE SEA PRESENTED A SMOOTH AND SOLID FOOTING
NOT THAT THERE THE BARREN SHORE HAD ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF NOURISHMENT TO OFFER THEM BUT THEIR INSTINCT IMPELLED THEM TO HAUNT NOW THE VERY HABITATIONS WHICH FORMERLY THEY WOULD HAVE SHUNNED
AND FROM THE FACT THAT THE AXIS IF PRODUCED WOULD PASS THROUGH A POINT SO LITTLE REMOVED ABOVE THE HORIZON HE DEDUCED THE INFERENCE THAT THE MEDITERRANEAN MUST HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED TO THE EQUATOR
I WOULD GIVE A MONTH OF MY LIFE HE CRIED IMPETUOUSLY FOR EVERY HOUR THAT THE OLD FELLOW GOES SLEEPING ON YOU MIGHT BE MAKING A BAD BARGAIN SAID PROCOPE SMILING
I WOULD I SAY OLD PILATE A MONOPOLY ISN'T ALWAYS A GOOD THING IS IT I SAY OLD SEPHARVAIM WHAT A FLOURISHING TRADE YOU'RE DRIVING MEANWHILE SEVENTY KILOGRAMMES OF EACH OF THE ARTICLES REQUIRED WERE WEIGHED AND THE JEW FOR EACH SEVENTY HAD TO TAKE THE PRICE OF TEN
BELOW ZERO
BELOW ZERO
BELOW ZERO
BUT HE FELT THAT HE COULD NEVER FORGIVE THE SLIGHT THAT HAD BEEN CAST UPON HIS BELOVED HOME
HAVE YOU ANY OPINION TO OFFER COUNT MY OWN OPINION CAPTAIN COINCIDES ENTIRELY WITH YOURS
THE HURRICANE RAGED WITH TREMENDOUS FURY AND THE WAVES ROSE TO A HEIGHT THAT SEEMED TO DEFY CALCULATION
BY THE 18TH OF JANUARY THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THAT PLANET AND THE EARTH HAD BECOME REDUCED TO BETWEEN TWO AND THREE MILLIONS OF MILES AND THE INTENSITY OF ITS LIGHT CAST HEAVY SHADOWS FROM ALL TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS
MAY IT NOT BE THE VOLCANO THAT WE SAW WHILST WE WERE ON BOARD THE DOBRYNA THE LIEUTENANT AGREED THAT IT WAS VERY PROBABLE
THE EXPERIENCES OF THE LAST TWO YEARS WERE FADING FROM THEIR MINDS LIKE A DREAM
THE ORDERLY HOWEVER WHO HAD LISTENED WITH MUCH AMUSEMENT WAS BY NO MEANS DISINCLINED FOR THE CONVERSATION TO BE CONTINUED
ITALIAN
THE VOLCANIC ERUPTION WAS MANIFESTLY VERY CONSIDERABLE THE ENTIRE SUMMIT OF THE PROMONTORY BEING ENVELOPED IN FLAMES
IT IS A PYLONE THAT HAS BEEN USED FOR SOME GEODESIC SURVEY THE NEXT MOMENT THE SAIL WAS FILLED AND THE YAWL WAS BEARING DOWN UPON THE OBJECT WITH INCONCEIVABLE SWIFTNESS BOTH CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND THE LIEUTENANT TOO EXCITED TO UTTER A WORD
IT WAS A TRYING TIME BUT THROUGHOUT IT ALL THE CREW BEHAVED WITH THE GREATEST COURAGE AND COMPOSURE
AND AS IF TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS OF THE MOONLIGHT THE HEAVENS WERE ILLUMINATED BY A SUPERB SHOWER OF FALLING STARS FAR EXCEEDING BOTH IN NUMBER AND IN BRILLIANCY THE PHENOMENA WHICH ARE COMMONLY DISTINGUISHED AS THE AUGUST AND NOVEMBER METEORS
YOUR VERSES ARE DETESTABLE TRASH AS GOOD AS ANY OTHERS CAPTAIN SQUEAKED THROUGH A REED PIPE HOLD YOUR TONGUE MAN SAID SERVADAC PEREMPTORILY
HIS VOLUBILITY WAS BROUGHT TO A SUDDEN CHECK BY SERVADAC'S BIDDING TWO OF THE SAILORS WITHOUT MORE ADO TO TAKE HIM IN THEIR ARMS AND PUT HIM QUIETLY DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR
THE MOON COULD NOT POSSIBLY BECOME HERS ASSUMING HOWEVER CONTINUED SERVADAC SUCH TO BE THE CASE I AM AFRAID SAID THE LIEUTENANT INTERRUPTING HIM THAT I CANNOT ASSUME ANYTHING OF THE SORT EVEN FOR A MOMENT SERVADAC SMILED GOOD-HUMOREDLY
FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND A HALF OF HIS EXISTENCE HE HAD BEEN THE FOSTER-CHILD OF THE STURDY WIFE OF A VINE-DRESSER OF MEDOC--A LINEAL DESCENDANT OF THE HEROES OF ANCIENT PROWESS
IT STRUCK HIM THAT PERHAPS THE AIR IN ITS STRANGELY MODIFIED CONDITION WOULD FAIL TO SUPPLY SUFFICIENT OXYGEN AND THAT THE STOVE IN CONSEQUENCE MIGHT NOT FULFILL ITS FUNCTION
WHAT IS SHE DOING
I PRESUME YOU ARE TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE GALLIAN YEAR--BY WHICH I MEAN THE TIME IN WHICH GALLIA MAKES ONE REVOLUTION ROUND THE SUN--IS EQUAL IN LENGTH TO TWO TERRESTRIAL YEARS THEY SIGNIFIED THEIR ASSENT
TAKING UP THE POWERFUL FIELD-GLASS WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO USE IN HIS SURVEYING OPERATIONS HE PROCEEDED TO INVESTIGATE MORE CAREFULLY THE LUMINOUS ORB
IF NOT I SHALL SHUT UP SHOP HAKKABUT KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THE ORDERLY WAS NOT A MAN TO BE TRIFLED WITH AND SAID IN A TREMULOUS VOICE YES I WILL BUY THE PROFESSOR WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON WITH MUCH INTEREST BETRAYED MANIFEST SYMPTOMS OF SATISFACTION
NEVER DESPAIR LIEUTENANT PROCOPE QUITE CONCURRED WITH THE CAPTAIN
LIKE BIRDS THE POPULATION SPENT WHOLE DAYS EXPOSED TO ITS GRATEFUL WARMTH RARELY RETURNING TILL NIGHTFALL TO THE SHADE OF THEIR GLOOMY HOME
BUT I WILL TELL YOU ALL THAT WE DO KNOW AND ALL THAT WE HAVE SURMISED AND AS BRIEFLY AS HE COULD HE RELATED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE THE MEMORABLE NIGHT OF THE THIRTY-FIRST OF DECEMBER
GENERALLY TACITURN AND MOROSE HE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY UNCIVIL WHENEVER ANY ONE VENTURED TO SPEAK TO HIM
THE TEMPERATURE WAS NOW AT LEAST FIFTEEN DEGREES ABOVE ZERO AND THE WALLS OF THE GALLERY WERE BEGINNING TO FEEL QUITE WARM TO THE TOUCH AN INDICATION NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED THAT THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH THE ROCK WAS COMPOSED WAS METALLIC IN ITS NATURE AND CAPABLE OF CONDUCTING HEAT
IN FACT GALLIA WAS PASSING THROUGH THAT METEORIC RING WHICH IS KNOWN TO LIE EXTERIOR TO THE EARTH'S ORBIT BUT ALMOST CONCENTRIC WITH IT
HEDGES TREES AND STREAMS WERE CLEARED AT A BOUND AND UNDER THESE CONDITIONS BEN ZOOF FELT THAT HE COULD HAVE OVERSTEPPED MONTMARTRE AT A SINGLE STRIDE
HER MERRY PRATTLE ENLIVENED THE GLOOM OF THE GRIM CAVERN LIKE THE SWEET NOTES OF A BIRD
THE RAPIDITY OF ITS DISPLACEMENT RATHER FORCED HIM TO THE CONJECTURE THAT IT MUST BE A COMET AND THIS OPINION WAS SOON STRENGTHENED BY THE APPEARANCE OF A COMA AND SUBSEQUENTLY CONFIRMED AS THE BODY APPROACHED THE SUN BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TAIL
BUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED NOW
THE END OF THE WORLD APPROACHING
IT IS PROBABLY ONLY A SEVERE FLOOD THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD
AND NINA AND PABLO WERE ONLY TOO DELIGHTED AT THE PROSPECT OF ACCOMPANYING THEIR KIND PROTECTORS ON ANY FRESH EXCURSION WHATEVER
WHEN WILL YOU PAY ME MY MONEY
SHOW ME WHERE LOOK THERE ANSWERED THE LIEUTENANT AND HE KEPT POINTING STEADILY IN ITS DIRECTION UNTIL SERVADAC ALSO DISTINCTLY SAW THE BRIGHT SPECK IN THE DISTANCE
YOU SEEM TO FORGET MY RIGHTS
THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN IT BUT HERE THEY WERE ONCE MORE UPON TERRESTRIAL SOIL
THUS IT FELL OUT THAT ONE MORNING BEN ZOOF FROM HIS LOOKOUT ON GOURBI ISLAND SAW A SHIP NOT THE DOBRYNA APPEAR UPON THE HORIZON AND MAKE QUIETLY DOWN TOWARDS WHAT HAD FORMERLY BEEN THE RIGHT BANK OF THE SHELIF
ALL AT ONCE BEN ZOOF BREAKS THE SILENCE
WE WILL NOT MAKE ANY PROFIT
THE CHILLED CONDITION OF THE ATMOSPHERE PREVENTED THE FORMATION OF CLOUDS
THE MEN HESITATED
THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WAS WANTED SOON CAME
CAN YOU FORM A JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT DISTANCE WE ARE LIKELY TO BE CARRIED YOU ARE ASKING TOO MUCH REMONSTRATED THE COUNT
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL MADE IT HIS SPECIAL CARE TO SEE THAT HIS PEOPLE WERE ALL WELL FED AND WARMLY CLAD
BECAUSE THESE VERY SPANIARDS HAVE BY FORMAL CONTRACT MADE OVER CEUTA IN ITS INTEGRITY TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT SERVADAC UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE
THE SEA HAD NOW BECOME NAVIGABLE AND THREE VOYAGES WERE MADE TO GOURBI ISLAND IN THE STEAM LAUNCH CONSUMING THE LAST OF THEIR LITTLE RESERVE OF COAL
BUT THE BEACON OF MESSINA WAS NOT TO BE DISCERNED
ROSETTE SCARCELY BENT HIS HEAD
BEN ZOOF WHEN HE WAS MADE AWARE THAT THE EARTH WOULD BE INVISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE FROM THE SURFACE OF SATURN DECLARED THAT HE THEN FOR HIS PART DID NOT CARE TO LEARN ANY MORE ABOUT SUCH A PLANET
SUCH BEING THE CONDITION OF THE ADJACENT LAND IT COULD HARDLY BE A MATTER OF SURPRISE THAT ALL THE SEA-BIRDS THE ALBATROSS THE GULL THE SEA-MEW SOUGHT CONTINUAL REFUGE ON THE SCHOONER
A SLEDGE-RIDE FORMENTERA WAS AT ONCE RECOGNIZED BY SERVADAC AND THE COUNT AS THE NAME OF ONE OF THE SMALLEST OF THE BALEARIC ISLANDS
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT NO ONE TROUBLED HIMSELF TO INSTITUTE A SEARCH AFTER HIM AND AS BEN ZOOF SENTENTIOUSLY REMARKED PERHAPS OLD JEHORAM IS MAKING MONEY IN AMERICA BY EXHIBITING HIMSELF AS THE LATEST ARRIVAL FROM A COMET BUT HOWEVER GREAT WAS THE RESERVE WHICH CAPTAIN SERVADAC MIGHT MAKE ON HIS PART NOTHING COULD INDUCE PROFESSOR ROSETTE TO CONCEAL HIS EXPERIENCES
PALMYRIN ROSETTE WAS SUDDENLY SEPARATED FROM HIS SERVANT JOSEPH AND WHEN AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS HE CAME TO HIMSELF HE FOUND THAT HE WAS THE SOLITARY OCCUPANT OF THE ONLY FRAGMENT THAT SURVIVED OF THE BALEARIC ARCHIPELAGO
I HARDLY KNOW HOW WE SHOULD HAVE GOT ON WITHOUT HER WHAT IS TO BECOME OF HER WHEN WE ARRIVE BACK AT THE EARTH NOT MUCH FEAR BEN ZOOF BUT THAT SHE WILL BE WELL TAKEN CARE OF
THE NEXT DAY OR TWO WERE SPENT IN PROVIDING FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE NEW COMER
HE HALF OPENED HIS EYES CLOSED THEM AGAIN THEN OPENED THEM COMPLETELY BUT WITHOUT EXHIBITING ANY CONSCIOUSNESS WHATEVER OF HIS SITUATION
WITHOUT REMOVING HIS EYE FROM HIS TELESCOPE SERVADAC EXCLAIMED
THE SEA-BOTTOM WAS COMPOSED OF NEITHER ROCK MUD SAND NOR SHELLS
WHAT WILL YOU CHARGE FOR IT ASKED ISAAC MOURNFULLY PUTTING HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET AND CHINKING HIS MONEY
MOUNTED UPON ZEPHYR AND GALETTE THE CAPTAIN AND THE COUNT SCOURED THE ISLAND IN SEARCH OF SOME AVAILABLE RETREAT
BUT EVEN IF THEIR SPIRIT OF COURTESY HAD DISPOSED THEM TO RENEW THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE BRITISH OFFICERS THERE WERE TWO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT JUST THEN WOULD HAVE RENDERED SUCH A PROPOSAL VERY UNADVISABLE
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS HE WENT ON TO SAY
IN THAT CASE INDEED THE EARTH WOULD RUSH ONWARDS TOWARDS THE SUN AND IN SIXTY-FOUR DAYS AND A HALF THE CATASTROPHE YOU DREAD WOULD INEVITABLY HAPPEN AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVADAC EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN SIMPLY THIS CAPTAIN
BEN ZOOF BURST INTO A ROAR OF LAUGHTER
WHEN HE RETURNED HE SAID IF YOU WANT TO WEIGH THIS COMET OF YOURS I SUPPOSE YOU WANT A PAIR OF SCALES
AND THE VERY KILOGRAMME WEIGHT YOU USED WOULD HAVE BECOME LIGHTER PUT IN THE COUNT DEFERENTIALLY
PAPER INDEED THEY WERE
SPANIARDS AND RUSSIANS ALIKE JOINED HEARTILY IN THE WORK THE DIMINUTION OF ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AND OF THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION CONTRIBUTING SUCH AN INCREASE TO THEIR MUSCULAR FORCE AS MATERIALLY FACILITATED ALL THEIR LABORS
OR PERCHANCE MORE LIKELY THAN ALL NORTHERN EUROPE HAD RECEIVED NO TIDINGS OF THE CONVULSION THAT HAD SHATTERED THE SOUTH
PRETTY LITTLE COMET SAID BEN ZOOF
ROSSINI HAS BEEN DEEPLY INJURED AND I CANNOT SUFFER THE INJURY TO BE UNAVENGED
FIRST OF ALL THE THERMOMETER IS ALREADY DOWN TO 22 DEGREES BELOW ZERO AND THE KEEN WIND FROM THE SOUTH IS MAKING THE TEMPERATURE ABSOLUTELY UNENDURABLE
IN A MYSTERY EVERY ONE FOUND HIMSELF UPON THE EARTH AGAIN
HAD HE OBSERVED THAT THE MOON HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED AND THAT THE EARTH HAD BEEN IN IMMINENT HAZARD OF RUNNING FOUL OF THE PLANET VENUS
BUT HE WOULD NOT SELL THEM YET
AND A MONTH A TERRESTRIAL MONTH THIRTY OLD DAYS SIXTY NEW DAYS HENCE IT WILL BE THE 86TH OF MARCH HA HA ROARED THE CAPTAIN
THE SKY BECAME OVERCAST BUT THERE WAS NO RISE IN THE TEMPERATURE
IT WAS THE FRAGMENT THAT THE INTERNAL CONVULSION HAD RENT FROM THE SURFACE OF THE COMET AND WHICH WAS NOW MANY THOUSANDS OF LEAGUES AWAY PURSUING THE NEW ORBIT INTO WHICH IT HAD BEEN PROJECTED
BUT DAY SUCCEEDED TO DAY WITH SUCH GLOOMY SAMENESS THAT IT WAS LITTLE WONDER THAT NO NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THE LAPSE OF TIME
SECONDLY ITS MASS THAT IS THE QUALITY OF ITS MATTER
WITHOUT VOUCHSAFING ANY REPLY THE CAPTAIN BECKONED TO THE OLD MAN TO FOLLOW HIM AND LEADING THE WAY TO THE CENTRAL HALL STOPPED AND TURNING SO AS TO LOOK HIM STEADILY IN THE FACE SAID NOW IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY
THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR BEN ZOOF'S FORBEARANCE AND STOOPING DOWN HE CAUGHT UP A HUGE STONE WHEN TO HIS SURPRISE HE FOUND THAT IT WAS NO HEAVIER THAN A PIECE OF PETRIFIED SPONGE
I TOLD YOU SO CRIED THE COLONEL TRIUMPHANTLY
WORSE THAN THAT I FEAR BEN ZOOF HE REPLIED WITH EMOTION
WHAT IF HIS MARTS FOR BUSINESS WERE GONE FOR EVER
BUT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THEY PROCEEDED TO JOIN THEM WHEN ON THEIR WAY THEY WERE STARTLED BY LOUD CRIES FROM THOSE IN ADVANCE
IN A WORD HE WAS ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHOM NATURE SEEMS TO HAVE PREDESTINED FOR REMARKABLE THINGS AND AROUND WHOSE CRADLE HAVE HOVERED THE FAIRY GODMOTHERS OF ADVENTURE AND GOOD LUCK
IT WAS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THE UNKNOWN WRITER HAD THENCE SENT OUT THE MYSTERIOUS DOCUMENTS AND FROM THE MESSAGE JUST COME TO HAND BY THE CARRIER-PIGEON IT APPEARED ALL BUT CERTAIN THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF APRIL A FORTNIGHT BACK HE HAD STILL BEEN THERE
THE THERMOMETER CONTINUED TO FALL
WHENCE CAME IT THAT A RADIANCE INTENSER THAN THE EFFULGENCE OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS OVERSPREAD THE FIRMAMENT AND MOMENTARILY DIMMED THE SPLENDOR OF THE BRIGHTEST STARS
I DID WHAT I COULD BY LOG AND COMPASS
BUT MEANWHILE A MARVELOUS WORLD NEVER BEFORE SO CLOSE WITHIN THE RANGE OF HUMAN VISION WAS REVEALING ITSELF
AFTER ALLOWING FOR A CERTAIN MARGIN OF MISCALCULATION THE MAIN FACT REMAINED UNDENIABLE
THERE WAS ENGLAND MARCHING LIKE SOME STATELY DAME TOWARDS THE EAST TRAILING HER AMPLE SKIRTS AND CORONETED WITH THE CLUSTER OF HER LITTLE ISLETS
HIS RECENT USURIOUS TRANSACTION HAD WHETTED HIS APPETITE
HIS ORDERLY WAS HIS SOLE COMPANION AND BY ANY OTHER MAN THAN THE CAPTAIN THE ENFORCED EXILE WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTEEMED LITTLE SHORT OF A SEVERE PENANCE
THESE WERE LEFT IN QUIET POSSESSION OF THEIR QUARTERS AS NOT ONLY WAS IT DEEMED ADVISABLE TO PERPETUATE THE VARIOUS BREEDS BUT IT WAS FOUND THAT THESE BIRDS ACTED AS A KIND OF POLICE NEVER FAILING EITHER TO CHASE AWAY OR TO KILL ANY OTHERS OF THEIR SPECIES WHO INFRINGED UPON WHAT THEY APPEARED TO REGARD AS THEIR OWN SPECIAL PRIVILEGE IN INTRUDING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THEIR DOMAIN
FIRST THAT THE COMET BEING IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED MIGHT BE DRAWN ON TO THE VERY SURFACE OF THE PLANET AND THERE ANNIHILATED
THE PAPER HAD AN INSCRIPTION WRITTEN IN FOUR LINES WHICH WERE REMARKABLE FOR THE PROFUSION OF NOTES OF ADMIRATION AND INTERROGATION WITH WHICH THEY WERE INTERSPERSED
VA BENE REPLIED THE CHILD
THE PERIODIC RECURRENCE OF ITS PHASES
THE UNPRACTICED SAILORS HAD ONLY TO HOIST THEIR SAILS AND THOUGH THEY WERE QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THE BREEZE CARRIED THEM TO THE ONLY SPOT UPON THE LITTLE WORLD THEY OCCUPIED WHICH COULD AFFORD THEM A REFUGE
WE WILL PROCEED GENTLEMEN IF YOU PLEASE TO WEIGH GALLIA BEN ZOOF WHO HAD JUST ENTERED THE HALL CAUGHT THE PROFESSOR'S LAST SENTENCE AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD WENT OUT AGAIN AND WAS ABSENT FOR SOME MINUTES
UNDER THE LIEUTENANT'S DIRECTION THE RUSSIAN SAILORS WERE IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK
IT WAS PROPOSED BY MEANS OF TELESCOPES TO NOTE THE PLACE WHERE THE BALL FIRST TOUCHED THE WATER AND THUS TO OBTAIN AN APPROXIMATION SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE AS TO THE TRUE RANGE
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO THE PROFESSOR HE SAID
WE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE COLOR OF YOUR MONEY MERCIFUL HEAVENS THE OLD MAN WHINED ONCE MORE
A MYSTERIOUS SEA VIOLENT AS THE COMMOTION HAD BEEN THAT PORTION OF THE ALGERIAN COAST WHICH IS BOUNDED ON THE NORTH BY THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ON THE WEST BY THE RIGHT BANK OF THE SHELIF APPEARED TO HAVE SUFFERED LITTLE CHANGE
AT EIGHT O'CLOCK CAPTAIN SERVADAC RE-ENTERED THE GOURBI THE SINGLE APARTMENT OF WHICH CONTAINED HIS BED A SMALL WRITING-TABLE AND SOME TRUNKS THAT SERVED INSTEAD OF CUPBOARDS
THEN WHY SHOULDN'T WE GO AND VISIT VENUS SERVADAC DID HIS BEST TO EXPLAIN THAT AS THE TWO PLANETS WERE OF ABOUT EQUAL VOLUME AND WERE TRAVELING WITH GREAT VELOCITY IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS ANY COLLISION BETWEEN THEM MUST BE ATTENDED WITH THE MOST DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES TO ONE OR BOTH OF THEM
REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED OUR MAXIMUM OF COLD REPLIED PROCOPE
PLAGUE ON IT
BUT THERE WAS NO DOUBT SOME EXPEDIENT MUST BE DEVISED TO PREVENT DISASTER AND THAT WITHOUT DELAY
AT THIS LOW TEMPERATURE WE COULD NOT SURVIVE THE WINTER
THE DAYS NOW ARE ONLY HALF AS LONG AS THEY USED TO BE ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN
AND NOW CORPORAL WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS WITH ME ASKED MAJOR OLIPHANT
PERHAPS THAT WAS ALL FORGOTTEN NOW
HE WENT ON PREPARING A WARM BED INTO WHICH HE MANAGED TO REMOVE HIS PATIENT WHO SOON FELL INTO A CALM AND NATURAL SLEEP
IF WE ARE REALLY NEAR LAND I SHOULD BE AFRAID TO APPROACH IT IN THE DARK THE COUNT EXPRESSED HIS APPROVAL OF THE LIEUTENANT'S CAUTION AND THEREUPON ALL SAIL WAS SHORTENED SO AS TO KEEP THE DOBRYNA FROM MAKING ANY CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS ALL THROUGH THE HOURS OF NIGHT
LEAVE YOUR EGGS IN THE SAUCEPAN A GOOD QUARTER OF AN HOUR BOIL THEM HARD
THE SUN WAS RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE ZENITH
THE CAPTAIN VAULTED INTO THE SADDLE AND FOLLOWED BY HIS ATTENDANT WELL MOUNTED AS HIMSELF STARTED OFF TOWARDS MOSTAGANEM
OTHERWISE DEATH WAS INEVITABLE
THE RESULT OF THESE STUDIES NO ONE VENTURED TO INQUIRE
BEN ZOOF HAD AN INKLING THAT HIS MASTER WAS UP TO SOME OTHER LITTLE GAME WHEN JUST BEFORE STARTING HE ASKED HIM PRIVATELY WHETHER THERE WAS A FRENCH TRICOLOR AMONG THE STORES
SEE HOW CIRCUMSCRIBED IS THE HORIZON SERVADAC REPLIED THAT HE HAD NOTICED THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCE FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS OF GOURBI ISLAND
CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT I AM NOT AWARE THAT THIS ISLAND ON WHICH WE FIND YOU IS WHAT REMAINS OF THE IONIAN REPRESENTATIVE REPUBLIC OVER WHICH YOU ENGLISH EXERCISE THE RIGHT OF PROTECTION BUT HAVE NO CLAIM OF GOVERNMENT THE COLONEL AND THE MAJOR LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN AMAZEMENT
THE SPANIARDS THOUGH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN UNCONCERNED TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE TO REMAIN UPON GALLIA WERE NEVERTHELESS LOOKING FORWARD WITH SOME DEGREE OF PLEASURE TO REVISITING THE PLAINS OF ANDALUSIA
MONEY IS SCARCE VERY SCARCE YOU KNOW NO MORE OF THIS SHOUTED SERVADAC
IT PROVED TO BE A ROUND LEATHER TELESCOPE-CASE ABOUT A FOOT LONG AND THE FIRST THING TO DO BEFORE INVESTIGATING ITS CONTENTS WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF ITS EXTERIOR
FEW SHORT MILES TO LEEWARD
IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DETACHED PORTION WAS NOT REVOLVING ROUND THE COMET BUT WAS GRADUALLY RETREATING INTO SPACE
IT IS A LIGHT ON THE HORIZON A LIGHT EXCLAIMED SERVADAC
NOTWITHSTANDING THEN THE EXTREME LOWNESS OF THE TEMPERATURE THE LITTLE POPULATION FOUND THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO MOVE ABOUT IN THE OPEN AIR WITH PERFECT IMMUNITY
BUT AT A DEPTH OF EIGHT FEET BELOW THE SURFACE THE NAVVIES CAME IN CONTACT WITH A HARD SURFACE UPON WHICH ALL THEIR TOOLS FAILED TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION
59,000,000 L
THESE WERE SAVED FOR THE SAKE OF PRESERVING THE SEVERAL BREEDS THE BULK OF THE ISLAND CATTLE BEING SLAUGHTERED AS THE EXTREME SEVERITY OF THE CLIMATE INSURED ALL MEAT REMAINING FRESH FOR ALMOST AN INDEFINITE PERIOD
AND BESIDES THIS THE CONSUMPTION OF THEIR COAL THROUGH THE SPEED THEY HAD MAINTAINED HAD BEEN SO GREAT THAT THERE WAS ONLY TOO MUCH REASON TO FEAR THAT FUEL WOULD FAIL THEM
ON FURTHER INVESTIGATION AN UNEXPECTED NUMBER OF GALLERIES WAS DISCOVERED SO THAT IN FACT THE INTERIOR OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS LIKE A VAST BEE-HIVE PERFORATED WITH INNUMERABLE CELLS
BUT IMPRESSED VERY PLAINLY WITH A SEAL ON THE WAX WERE THE TWO INITIALS P
A CONVULSION OF NATURE WHENCE CAME IT THAT AT THAT VERY MOMENT THE HORIZON UNDERWENT SO STRANGE AND SUDDEN A MODIFICATION THAT THE EYE OF THE MOST PRACTICED MARINER COULD NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SEA AND SKY
FROM WHAT THEY ASKED COULD HIS DISSATISFACTION ARISE
MOREOVER THE GALLIAN SEA WOULD ERE LONG BE FROZEN OVER AND THE MELTED ICE WATER IN ITS CONGEALED STATE BEING DIVESTED OF EVERY PARTICLE OF SALT WOULD AFFORD A SUPPLY OF DRINK THAT COULD NOT BE EXHAUSTED
THE PROJECT WAS THE ANNEXATION OF CEUTA TO THE FRENCH DOMINION
ALTOGETHER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE BRAVE FELLOW WOULD INCUR NO PERSONAL RISK BY REMAINING UPON THE ISLAND THE CAPTAIN WAS INDUCED WITH MUCH RELUCTANCE TO FOREGO THE ATTENDANCE OF HIS SERVANT HOPING VERY SHORTLY TO RETURN AND TO RESTORE HIM TO HIS COUNTRY WHEN HE HAD ASCERTAINED THE REASON OF THE MYSTERIES IN WHICH THEY WERE ENVELOPED
THE PEOPLE SEEMED RATHER TO VEGETATE THAN TO LIVE AND THEIR WANT OF VIGOR BECAME AT TIMES ALMOST ALARMING
APART FROM MOTIVES OF HUMANITY MOTIVES OF SELF-INTEREST MADE IT A MATTER OF THE DEEPEST CONCERN TO RESTORE ANIMATION TO THAT SENSELESS FORM
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION AND THE COMET'S
WITH HIS COMET NOW UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ONE STAR NOW OF ANOTHER WHAT VARIOUS SYSTEMS MIGHT HE NOT HAVE EXPLORED
EQUALLY URGENT WERE BOTH THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT TO BE ALLOWED TO ACCOMPANY HIM
OF COURSE I AM RIGHT REPLIED THE SNAPPISH PROFESSOR
LOOKING THENCE TOWARDS THE EARTH HE WOULD BE A SPECTATOR OF EVENTS THAT HAD HAPPENED SEVENTY YEARS PREVIOUSLY
HOWEVER GREAT WAS THE DESIRE TO FIND A RETREAT FOR EVERY LIVING THING IN THE DEEP HOLLOW OF THE CRATER IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO SLAUGHTER ALMOST ALL THE DOMESTIC ANIMALS BEFORE THE REMOVAL OF THE COMMUNITY FROM NINA'S HIVE
IT WAS MANIFESTLY IMPOSSIBLE THEY CONCEIVED THAT ANY HUMAN BEING COULD THERE HAVE SURVIVED THE COLD
IGNORANCE SHOUTED ROSETTE
WITH A GREEDINESS THAT COULD NOT BE CONCEALED HAKKABUT GRASPED THEM ALL
TO SAY THAT HE WAS ELATED AT THE PROSPECT WAS FAR BELOW THE TRUTH
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO COUNT WASSILI TIMASCHEFF MAJOR SIR JOHN TEMPLE OLIPHANT REPLIED THE COLONEL
THE COLD YOU KNOW THE COLD MAY DO INJURY TO THE SPRING
BALLOONS ARE EXPLODED THINGS
LET US GO BACK IN FULL FORCE THE NIGHT WOULD BE DARK
ALL FARTHER PROGRESS TO THE SOUTH IS CHECKED WESTWARDS BY ALL MEANS REPLIED SERVADAC QUICKLY
ASSERTING THAT WHILE THERE WAS LIFE THERE WAS HOPE BEN ZOOF RECOMMENCED HIS FRICTION WITH MORE VIGOR THAN EVER
ISAAC HAKKABUT WAS THE FIRST TO TAKE HIS PLACE IN THE CAR
YES BEN ZOOF
MAY I DEMAND YOUR CLAIM TO YOUR POSITION MY CLAIM IS THAT OF FIRST OCCUPANT BUT DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THE PARTY OF SPANIARDS NOW RESIDENT WITH ME MAY AT SOME FUTURE TIME ASSERT A PRIOR RIGHT TO THE PROPRIETORSHIP I THINK NOT CAPTAIN SERVADAC BUT WHY NOT PERSISTED THE CAPTAIN
HAD NOT THE DAY NOW DAWNED THAT SHOULD SET THEIR SPECULATIONS ALL AT REST
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THEY RECEIVED THE HEARTIEST OF WELCOMES
SHE WENT ON TO SAY THAT AT FIRST SHE HAD BEEN VERY FRIGHTENED
THE GUN WAS MANEUVERED IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES OF THE ARTILLERYMAN'S MANUAL AND THE FIRING COMMENCED
NOT A SINGLE LIVING CREATURE RELIEVED THE SOLITUDE
ACCORDINGLY THEY CAME TO THE MUTUAL RESOLUTION THAT THEY WOULD STICK TO THEIR POST TO SAY THE TRUTH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THE GALLANT OFFICERS TO DO OTHERWISE
COURAGE MY FRIEND COURAGE
EARLY NEXT MORNING THE CAPTAIN VENTURED TO TAKE THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT UP TO THE OBSERVATORY
AT FIRST SIGHT THE WRETCHED PLACE SEEMED TO BE DESERTED
BUT IT IS MUCH NICER HERE--I AM SO HAPPY HERE
BUT SOON BEN ZOOF STOPPED FOR THE THIRD TIME
SO THAT HE WAS EVER AND AGAIN PUTTING IN AN APPEARANCE AT THE GENERAL'S RECEPTIONS AT ORAN AND AT THE FETES GIVEN BY THE GOVERNOR AT ALGIERS
THE IDEA TO A CERTAIN EXTENT WAS PLAUSIBLE INASMUCH AS IT HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED THAT SEVERAL OF THE TELESCOPIC PLANETS ARE OF SUCH SMALL DIMENSIONS THAT A GOOD WALKER MIGHT MAKE A CIRCUIT OF THEM IN FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS
WHERE THEN CRIED SERVADAC EAGERLY WHERE ARE WE YOU ARE ON MY COMET ON GALLIA ITSELF AND THE PROFESSOR GAZED AROUND HIM WITH A PERFECT AIR OF TRIUMPH
YOU SPEAK AS UNCONCERNEDLY AS THOUGH YOU WERE TELLING ME THAT MY DINNER WAS READY ARE WE NOT PHILOSOPHERS CAPTAIN SAID THE ORDERLY
FREQUENT LANDSLIPS OCCURRED AND IN MANY PLACES DEEP CHASMS RIFTED THE GROUND
IT DOES NOT MOVE SAID SERVADAC
COME WHAT MAY HE PRESENTLY EXCLAIMED WE WILL MAKE UP OUR MINDS FOR THE FUTURE TO BE SURPRISED AT NOTHING RIGHT CAPTAIN REPLIED BEN ZOOF
I ONLY HOPE THE VENTILATION WILL HOLD OUT THERE WAS HOWEVER NOTHING TO FEAR ON THE SCORE OF VENTILATION
AND THE NEXT LINE SAID THE LIEUTENANT AFTER READING IT ALOUD APPARENTLY REGISTERS THE DISTANCE TRAVERSED BY GALLIA THE NEW LITTLE PLANET IN HER OWN ORBIT
BOTH SPANIARDS AND RUSSIANS WERE ALL OCCUPIED FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN THE WORK OF UNLOADING THE TARTAN
I ACCOUNT FOR IT IN THIS WAY ANSWERED ROSETTE
BUT SHAKE HANDS WITH ME IN EARNEST THAT I MAY BE SURE I AM NOT DREAMING HECTOR SERVADAC HAD MADE UP HIS MIND AND NO AMOUNT OF PERSUASION COULD INDUCE HIM TO DIVULGE HIS INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCES
AT SUNRISE ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE 2ND OF JANUARY OR WHAT ACCORDING TO THE ORDINARY CALENDAR WOULD HAVE BEEN THE NIGHT OF THE 1ST THE CAPTAIN AND HIS ORDERLY REMOUNTED THEIR HORSES AND DURING THE SIX-HOURS DAY ACCOMPLISHED A DISTANCE OF FORTY-TWO MILES
BUT THE TERRESTRIAL SPHERE SEEMED IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW HOURS TO HAVE BECOME CONSIDERABLY REDUCED IN VOLUME AND HE COULD NOW SEE FOR A DISTANCE OF ONLY SIX MILES IN EVERY DIRECTION
I SUPPOSE SIXTY OR SIXTY-TWO AS THE CASE MAY BE
THEIR ONLY FEAR WAS LEST SOME INSUPERABLE WALL OF ROCK SHOULD SUDDENLY BAR THEIR FURTHER PROGRESS
CERTAINLY
AND IN COMPARISON WITH THE INFINITE SPACE BEYOND THIS WAS A MERE NOTHING
EVERYTHING THAT APPERTAINED TO THE PLANET WAS DETERMINED
AND THERE IS ANOTHER THING WHICH TOTALLY DISPROVES THE CAPTAIN'S HYPOTHESIS
CONVEY HIM FURTHER AGAIN AND HE SHALL BE LOOKING UPON THE DREAD DESOLATION OF THE DELUGE
WHAT IS IT YOU MEAN ASKED SERVADAC GETTING SOMEWHAT IMPATIENT
A SUBSTANCE IT IS WHICH NO DOUBT CONSTITUTES THE SOLE MATERIAL OF THE COMET EXTENDING FROM ITS SURFACE TO ITS INNERMOST DEPTHS
HE HAD NO SHARE IN THE GENERAL ENTHUSIASM REFUSED EVEN TO ENTER OR INSPECT ANY OF THE GALLERIES AND INSISTED ON REMAINING ON BOARD HIS TARTAN
BUT EVEN IF HE HAD UNDERSTOOD THE RATIONALE OF THE CHANGE THE CONVULSION THAT HAD BROUGHT IT ABOUT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS MUCH A MYSTERY AS EVER
DON'T IMPOSE ON ME
HITHERTO FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS THE THERMOMETER HAD BEEN REGISTERING AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT 6 DEGREES BELOW ZERO AND IT HAD BECOME MATTER OF EXPERIENCE THAT THE STOVE ALTHOUGH REPLENISHED WITH ALL THE WOOD THAT WAS AVAILABLE WAS ALTOGETHER INADEQUATE TO EFFECT ANY SENSIBLE MITIGATION OF THE SEVERITY OF THE COLD
TRANSPORT HIM TO A STAR TEN TIMES DISTANT AND HE WILL BE REVIEWING THE TERRESTRIAL SPHERE OF 720 YEARS BACK
CAMPAIGNS SOUDAN AND JAPAN
IN THE STRUGGLE WITH THE GULLS THE BAG HAD BEEN PARTIALLY TORN OPEN BUT STILL CONTAINED THE FOLLOWING DISPATCH
ON LAND AS WELL AS ON SEA THE REMOTE DISTANCE HAD COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE GLOBE HAD ASSUMED A MORE DECIDED CONVEXITY
I AM NOW MAKING A LIKE ESTIMATE OF THE ELEMENTS OF NERINA CONSCIOUS HOW IMPOLITIC IT WOULD BE TO PRESS THIS MATTER FURTHER THE CAPTAIN CASUALLY REMARKED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED THAT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF NERINA HAD BEEN CALCULATED LONG SINCE BY ASTRONOMERS ON THE EARTH
NOT SO SURE OF THAT SIR SAID BEN ZOOF
HAD SHE BEEN FAITHLESS TO THE EARTH
HE WOUND UP HIS RECITAL BY REMARKING THAT THE CARGO OF THE HANSA WOULD BE OF IMMENSE SERVICE TO THEM
COME ON
COME ON
THEY MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH ACCOMMODATION AS THEY COULD GET PROVIDED IT WAS WARM
BUT THE ISLAND OF CEUTA WHICH BEFORE THE SHOCK HAD COMMANDED THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STRAIT AND HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY SPANIARDS HAD SINCE BEEN ABANDONED AND WAS THEREFORE FREE TO THE FIRST OCCUPANT WHO SHOULD LAY CLAIM TO IT
I ASK MYSELF AND I ASK YOU WHETHER IT IS IN OUR POWER BY ANY MEANS TO AVERT THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE ONLY TOO LIKELY TO FOLLOW COUNT TIMASCHEFF IN A VOICE THAT SEEMED TO THRILL WITH SOLEMNITY SAID
AFTER A LINGERING SURVEY OF THE CHESS-BOARD THE COLONEL SLOWLY LIFTED HIS EYES AND SAID WITH OFFICIAL DIGNITY WELL MEN WHAT IS IT FIRST OF ALL SIR REPLIED THE CORPORAL WE WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT OUR PAY AND THEN WE WISH TO HAVE A WORD WITH THE MAJOR ABOUT OUR RATIONS SAY ON THEN SAID COLONEL MURPHY
39 DEGREES N CAN'T SAY SIR
MANY A TIME DURING HIS ABSENCE HECTOR SERVADAC HAD WONDERED HOW HIS PRESENT VICISSITUDES WOULD END AND HE HAD FELT SOME MISGIVINGS AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD EVER AGAIN SET FOOT UPON THE ISLAND AND SEE HIS FAITHFUL ORDERLY SO THAT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT EMOTION THAT HE HAD APPROACHED THE COAST OF THE SOLE REMAINING FRAGMENT OF ALGERIAN SOIL
ON LEARNING THE DETAILS OF HIS FRIENDS DISCOVERIES COUNT TIMASCHEFF DID NOT HESITATE IN BELIEVING THAT THE EXHAUSTED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS LYING BEFORE HIM WAS THE AUTHOR ALIKE OF THE TWO UNSIGNED DOCUMENTS PICKED UP AT SEA AND OF THE THIRD STATEMENT SO RECENTLY BROUGHT TO HAND BY THE CARRIER-PIGEON
CAREFUL TO BE ALWAYS WELL SUPPLIED WITH THE PRODUCTS IN MOST GENERAL DEMAND--COFFEE SUGAR RICE TOBACCO COTTON STUFFS AND GUNPOWDER--AND BEING AT ALL TIMES READY TO BARTER AND PREPARED TO DEAL IN SECONDHAND WARES HE HAD CONTRIVED TO AMASS CONSIDERABLE WEALTH
THE CARDINAL POINTS HAVE BEEN DISPLACED
THE SPANIARDS WERE NATURALLY TOO INDOLENT TO BE AFFECTED IN ANY WAY BY AN INCIDENT THAT CONCERNED THEMSELVES SO REMOTELY
OTHERWISE WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT SO FAR OFF REPLIED PROCOPE
WHY NOT
CAPTAIN HECTOR SERVADAC STAFF OFFICER MOSTAGANEM ON THE OTHER WAS THE TITLE
THE MATE AND THREE SAILORS HAD ALL GONE ON SHORE AND IN COMMON WITH MANY OF THEIR FELLOW-CREATURES HAD ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED
I WAS OUT AT SEA CRUISING IN MY YACHT
SOME INFLATED SKINS HAD BEEN ATTACHED TO ITS SIDES SO THAT THE BALLOON MIGHT FLOAT FOR A TIME IN THE EVENT OF ITS DESCENDING IN THE SEA AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE SHORE
IRRITATED AND DISGUSTED AT ALL THE COLD FORMALITIES HECTOR SERVADAC RESOLVED TO LEAVE ALL THE TALKING TO THE COUNT
WITHOUT ANY INTENTIONAL DISPARAGEMENT THEY MIGHT IN A CERTAIN WAY BE COMPARED TO TWO SCARECROWS WHICH THOUGH PERFECTLY HARMLESS IN THEMSELVES INSPIRE SOME MEASURE OF RESPECT AND ARE EXCELLENTLY ADAPTED TO PROTECT THE TERRITORY INTRUSTED TO THEIR GUARDIANSHIP
MUTUALLY RESERVED THOUGH EVER COURTEOUS THE COUNT AND THE CAPTAIN WERE SECRETLY DRAWN TOGETHER BY THE PROSPECT OF A COMMON DANGER
THOUGH BY NO MEANS AFRAID OF THEM BEN ZOOF HAD A PARTICULAR AVERSION TO JACKALS PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY HAD NO PLACE AMONG THE FAUNA OF HIS BELOVED MONTMARTRE
CAPTAIN SERVADAC THINKING IT JUST PROBABLE THAT THE COUNT AS ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING MIGHT COME BY WATER WALKED TO THE RIDGE OF ROCK THAT OVERHUNG THE SHORE IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN IF THE DOBRYNA WERE ANYWHERE IN SIGHT
HAD SHE NOT IMMURED HERSELF IN A PERPETUAL PRISON
ALTHOUGH IT HAD PROVED THAT NOT A SINGLE CREATURE EITHER AT GOURBI ISLAND GIBRALTAR CEUTA MADALENA OR FORMENTERA HAD RECEIVED ANY INJURY WHATEVER AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST CONCUSSION THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE LEAST TO MAKE IT CERTAIN THAT A LIKE IMMUNITY FROM HARM WOULD ATTEND THE SECOND
HAVING REMOUNTED THE ASCENT THEY MADE THE RESULT OF THEIR EXPLORATION KNOWN TO THE MASS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO RECEIVED THE TIDINGS WITH A SENSE OF RELIEF AND CORDIALLY ACCEPTED THE SCHEME OF THE MIGRATION
I CAN SIR
BEGINNING TO FEEL HUNGRY THEY HAD NO HESITATION IN GATHERING FIGS DATES AND ORANGES FROM THE PLANTATIONS THAT FORMED A CONTINUOUS RICH AND LUXURIANT ORCHARD ALONG THEIR PATH
RACING THROUGH THE GALLERIES OF THE HIVE CLAMBERING OVER THE ROCKS UPON THE SHORE ONE DAY SKATING FAR AWAY ACROSS THE FROZEN OCEAN THE NEXT FISHING IN THE LAKE THAT WAS KEPT LIQUID BY THE HEAT OF THE LAVA-TORRENT THE TWO CHILDREN LED A LIFE OF PERPETUAL ENJOYMENT
BUSINESS
BUT ONCE GRANTED THE INITIAL AND THE CLOSING EXTRAVAGANCE THE DEPARTURE AND RETURN OF HIS CHARACTERS THE ALPHA AND OMEGA OF HIS TALE HOW CLOSELY THE AUTHOR CLINGS TO FACTS BETWEEN
HE WOULD MAKE EUROPEAN PRICES PAY AFTER ALL
WAS IT NOT A NEW RECORD IN THE ANNALS OF SCIENCE
THEY WERE ALSO UNCONSCIOUS THAT THEIR VOICES WERE THIN AND FEEBLE
SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT THIS CESSATION OF THE ERUPTION IS ONLY PARTIAL
A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CHARGES HAVING BEEN PROVIDED THE CORPORAL BROUGHT HIS MEN TO THE REDUCT WHENCE THE GUN'S MOUTH PROJECTED OVER A SLOPING EMBRASURE
OUR VELOCITY IS CHANGED ON THE EARTH REPEATED THE PROFESSOR WITH DECISION
SHE WAS NOW THEREFORE IN THE CENTER OF THE ZONE OF TELESCOPIC PLANETS THAT REVOLVE BETWEEN THE ORBITS OF MARS AND JUPITER AND HAD CAPTURED FOR HERSELF A SATELLITE WHICH ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT WAS NERINA ONE OF THE ASTEROIDS MOST RECENTLY IDENTIFIED
I AM POOR
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL PLENTY REPLIED SERVADAC
WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME BEFORE US AT PRESENT
HAPPILY SERVADAC AND HIS ORDERLY WERE FEARLESS RIDERS
OBSERVING THAT SERVADAC WAS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS LIEUTENANT PROCOPE HAD LEISURE TO CONTEMPLATE SOME OF THE PRESENT PERPLEXING PROBLEMS AND TO PONDER OVER THE TRUE ASTRONOMICAL POSITION
COME NOW WHAT IS THE USE OF YOUR HESITATING
THE DOMESTIC ANIMALS REQUIRED A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION
THEN THE WHITE CRESTS OF THE CLIFFS WERE NO LONGER TO BE SEEN
WE MUST BE GRATEFUL TO THE GOOD PROTECTOR WHO HAS HITHERTO BEFRIENDED US AND WE MUST TRUST HIS MERCY TO THE END FOR A FEW MOMENTS THEY BOTH STOOD IN SILENCE AND CONTEMPLATED LAND AND SEA
COULD HE BRING HIMSELF TO BELIEVE THAT ALL THE INHABITANTS HIS FRIENDS AND COMRADES HAD PERISHED
IX
AND AS IT WAS GROWING LATE HE MADE AN EXCUSE THAT HE HAD NO MORE LEISURE
AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE TOMB OF ST LOUIS THE ONLY SPOT THAT HAD SURVIVED THE MYSTERIOUS SHOCK WAS LOST TO VIEW
THERE WAS NOTHING TO PREVENT HIM IF HE CHOSE FROM PARTAKING GRATUITOUSLY OF THE VOLCANIC LIGHT AND HEAT WHICH WERE BEING ENJOYED BY ALL BESIDES
IT WAS ALTOGETHER QUITE AS MUCH A MATTER OF CONGRATULATION AS OF REGRET THAT THE VOLCANO SHOWED NO SYMPTOMS OF RESUMING ITS ACTIVITY
THE VERY THING I WANT
BUT TO SERVADAC'S INCREASING ASTONISHMENT HE COULD THROW NO LIGHT UPON THE CAUSE OF ANY OF THE PHENOMENA
HERE IS MY OLD TUTOR MR ROSETTE IN VERY FLESH AND BLOOD CAN'T SAY MUCH FOR THE FLESH MUTTERED BEN ZOOF
THE PROJECT MAY APPEAR EXTRAVAGANT BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
THE SCHOONER ACCORDINGLY WAS STEERED DIRECTLY TOWARDS IT AND IN LESS THAN AN HOUR HAD CAST ANCHOR WITHIN A FEW CABLES LENGTHS OF THE SHORE
THE DOBRYNA SIGNALIZED HER ARRIVAL BY FIRING HER CANNON AND DROPPED ANCHOR IN THE LITTLE PORT OF THE SHELIF
TO BE ABLE TO DO ALL THIS I SEE YOU MUST BE RICH AS WELL AS LEARNED WITH A GOOD-NATURED LAUGH AT THE ORDERLY'S REMARK THE MEETING ADJOURNED FOR A FEW HOURS
I LEFT YOU ON A CONTINENT AND HERE I HAVE THE HONOR OF FINDING YOU ON AN ISLAND I ASSURE YOU COUNT I HAVE NEVER LEFT THE PLACE I AM QUITE AWARE OF IT
AFTER PONDERING LONG AND AS PROFOUNDLY AS HE COULD UPON THESE FIGURES CAPTAIN SERVADAC CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AS THE EARTH WAS NOW RECEIVING ABOUT DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT AND HEAT THAT IT HAD BEEN RECEIVING BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE IT WAS RECEIVING ABOUT THE SAME AS THE PLANET VENUS
SERVADAC WAS SOME DISTANCE AHEAD
THE OLD JEW MAY MAKE A DIFFICULTY ABOUT LENDING US ANY OF HIS PROPERTY WHY SHOULD WE NOT ALL GO ASKED THE COUNT
THE STEAM-LAUNCH RETURNED TO GOURBI ISLAND AND PREPARATIONS WERE FORTHWITH TAKEN IN HAND FOR CONVEYING MAN AND BEAST CORN AND FODDER ACROSS TO THE VOLCANIC HEADLAND
THE RIDGE HOWEVER HAD BEEN VIOLENTLY RUPTURED AND NOW ROSE PERPENDICULARLY FROM THE WATER
HE HAD AT ONE TIME BEEN ENGAGED UPON A TRIGONOMETRICAL SURVEY OF THE DISTRICT AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD AN ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS TOPOGRAPHY
THE VISITORS HAVING TAKEN WHAT SEATS THEY COULD HAKKABUT CLOSED THE DOOR AND LIKE A PRISONER AWAITING HIS SENTENCE STOOD WITH FOLDED HANDS EXPECTING THE CAPTAIN TO SPEAK
UNPROTECTED ON THAT DREAR EXPANSE ANY TRAVELER MUST ASSUREDLY SUCCUMB TO THE SNOW-DRIFTS THAT WERE CONTINUALLY BEING WHIRLED ACROSS IT
THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE PALE RAYS OF THE SUN APPARENTLY LESSENED IN ITS MAGNITUDE CAST ONLY FAINT AND SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN SHADOWS
QUICKER AND QUICKER IS THE VELOCITY
IT HAD TRANSPIRED THAT THE CANNON-BALL FIRED IN EXPERIMENT FROM THE ISLAND HAD NOT ONLY DAMAGED ONE OF THE SPARS OF THE SCHOONER BUT HAD BROKEN PANOFKA'S PIPE AND MOREOVER HAD JUST GRAZED HIS NOSE WHICH FOR A RUSSIAN'S WAS UNUSUALLY LONG
THE BIRD WHEELED ROUND AND ROUND IN A FEW CIRCLES THAT WIDENED IN THEIR DIAMETER AND QUICKLY SUNK TO AN ALTITUDE IN THE COMET'S ATMOSPHERE MUCH INFERIOR TO THE BALLOON
HE ONLY GREW MORE AND MORE CONVINCED THAT HE HAD ONCE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THEM
THE EVENT WAS PRECISELY WHAT HE HAD FORETOLD
WHAT A PROUD THING IT WOULD BE TO HAVE SECURED ITS POSSESSION TO FRANCE NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR BRIEF FAREWELL OF THEIR FRIENDS AND WERE FAIRLY OUT OF SIGHT OF THE SHORE SERVADAC IMPARTED HIS DESIGN TO BEN ZOOF WHO ENTERED INTO THE PROJECT WITH THE GREATEST ZEST AND EXPRESSED HIMSELF DELIGHTED NOT ONLY AT THE PROSPECT OF ADDING TO THE DOMINIONS OF HIS BELOVED COUNTRY BUT OF STEALING A MARCH UPON ENGLAND
AND THE CONCLUSION WAS IRRESISTIBLE THAT IT WAS THE SOLE SURVIVING REMNANT OF FORMENTERA ONCE A MEMBER OF THE BALEARIC ARCHIPELAGO
THE STATEMENT SEEMS HIGHLY INCREDIBLE HE SAID
THE LITTLE ISLAND PROVED TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN AN ARID ROCK RISING ABRUPTLY ABOUT FORTY FEET ABOVE THE WATER
BUT THE OBSERVATION OF A FEW SEPARATE NIGHTS SOON MADE IT MANIFEST THAT THE STAR WAS RAPIDLY CHANGING ITS POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE ADJACENT STARS AND THE ASTRONOMER'S HEART BEGAN TO LEAP AT THE THOUGHT THAT THE RENOWN OF THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW PLANET WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIS NAME
A THRILL RAN THROUGH EVERY VEIN
AN HOUR LATER AND THE VOLCANO APPEARED LIKE A DIM SHADOW ON THE HORIZON THE LIGHT FROM THE CRATER SHEDDING A LURID GLARE UPON THE SURROUNDING GLOOM
PAGE LINE ORIGINAL CHANGED TO 16 10 O'CLOCK
SI VOUS ATTRAPEZ MON REFRAIN FAMEUX VOUS ETES THE CONCERT WAS SUCCEEDED BY A BALL UNQUESTIONABLY THE FIRST THAT HAD EVER TAKEN PLACE IN GALLIA
BUT HOW ABOUT THE NEW ORBIT IN WHICH WE ARE MOVING HE PAUSED AND PONDERED AND THEN LOOKED AT PROCOPE AS THOUGH AWAITING FROM HIM SOME FURTHER ELUCIDATION OF THE DIFFICULTY
AND AS A MATTER STILL MORE SURPRISING THAT IT KEPT STEADILY INCREASING AS THOUGH THE EARTH WERE GRADUALLY AND CONTINUOUSLY APPROXIMATING TO THE SUN
AND HERE HE DID THE HONORS OF HIS MODEST ESTABLISHMENT TO HIS TWO GUESTS THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT AND GAVE A WELCOME TOO TO LITTLE NINA WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED THEM ON SHORE AND BETWEEN WHOM AND BEN ZOOF THE MOST FRIENDLY RELATIONS HAD ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED
MAJOR OLIPHANT ACCOMPANIED THEM AND ALL FOUR HAVING TAKEN THEIR SEATS THE CONVERSATION WAS COMMENCED
IT MAKES ME VERY UNEASY REJOINED THE LIEUTENANT
ON THE 1ST OF NOVEMBER GALLIA AND JUPITER WERE 40,000,000 MILES APART
WE HAVE GOT A YEAR OF SOMETHING LIKE 2,880 DAYS I SHOULDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE AN EASY MATTER TO FIND SAINTS ENOUGH FOR SUCH A CALENDAR AS THAT SAID BEN ZOOF
WE MUST BIDE OUR TIME AND HEAR REPLIED THE COUNT
BEYOND A DOUBT WHAT WE SEE IS THE VOLCANO AND TO-MORROW WE WILL NOT FAIL TO VISIT IT ON RETURNING TO THE GOURBI THEY COMMUNICATED THEIR DISCOVERY TO COUNT TIMASCHEFF ONLY DEEMING ANY FURTHER PUBLICATION OF IT TO BE PREMATURE
AND THE WALLS OF THE APARTMENT WERE TAPESTRIED WITH THE SAILS AND ADORNED WITH THE FLAGS BELONGING TO THE YACHT
AS THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER VERGED TOWARDS ITS CLOSE JUPITER BEGAN TO WEAR AN ASPECT THAT MUST HAVE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF THE MOST IGNORANT OR THE MOST INDIFFERENT OBSERVER
NOR WAS SHE TO LOSE HERSELF AMONGST THE 5,000 NEBULAE WHICH HAVE RESISTED HITHERTO THE GRASP OF THE MOST POWERFUL REFLECTORS
CHAPTER XIII
CHAPTER XIII
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER CAPTAIN NOT TO ALLOW THE REAL CAUSE OF THIS TO TRANSPIRE FAR BETTER REPLIED SERVADAC
YOU SEEM HERE CONTINUED THE PROFESSOR TO BE VERY IGNORANT OF THE STATE OF THINGS HOW FAR WE ARE IGNORANT REJOINED SERVADAC I CANNOT TELL
THE YACHT WAS EVIDENTLY MAKING HER WAY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FORMER MOUTH OF THE SHELIF AND THE CAPTAIN WAS STRUCK WITH THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD DO WELL TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THERE WAS ANY SUITABLE MOORING TOWARDS WHICH HE MIGHT SIGNAL HER
VERNE HAS ENDEAVORED TO IMPART ONLY WHAT IS KNOWN TO EXIST
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE HOWEVER HESITATED AND AFTER REVOLVING MATTERS FOR A FEW MOMENTS IN HIS MIND POINTED OUT THAT AS THE WIND WAS BLOWING DIRECTLY FROM THE WEST AND SEEMED LIKELY TO INCREASE IF THEY WENT TO THE WEST IN THE TEETH OF THE WEATHER THE SCHOONER WOULD BE REDUCED TO THE USE OF HER ENGINE ONLY AND WOULD HAVE MUCH DIFFICULTY IN MAKING ANY HEADWAY
IT MIGHT BE OBSERVED TO TURN UPON ITS OWN AXIS IN TWENTY-THREE HOURS TWENTY-ONE MINUTES--AN EVIDENCE FROM THE UNALTERED DURATION OF ITS DAYS THAT THE PLANET HAD NOT SHARED IN THE DISTURBANCE
NO CONTINUED THE CAPTAIN
TRULY AS THE COUNT OBSERVED TO HIS COMRADES NONE BUT A DIVINE PILOT COULD STEER THEM NOW
THE POOL HITHERTO KEPT FLUID BY ITS PROXIMITY TO THE LAVA WAS ALREADY ENCRUSTED WITH A LAYER OF ICE
AND UNLESS I AM GREATLY DECEIVED I CAN HEAR A KIND OF REVERBERATION IN THE AIR FOR SOME SECONDS THE TWO MEN STOOD STRAINING EYES AND EARS IN RAPT ATTENTION
I WANT TO TELL HER THAT I LOVE HER SINCERELY AND WISH TO MARRY HER
NOT THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE ALTOGETHER SO FAVORABLE
AT ANOTHER TIME HE WOULD DECLARE THAT TO AN OLD USURER LIKE HIM IT COULD NOT MATTER IN THE LEAST WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE MOON AS HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE ADVANCED ANY MONEY UPON HER
AND DRIVEN BY WIND AND WAVE THE DOBRYNA UNDER THE DEXTEROUS GUIDANCE OF THE LIEUTENANT DASHED IN BETWEEN ITS PERPENDICULAR WALLS
ATTENTIVELY AND EAGERLY THEY LISTENED
I DARE NOT TELL YOU THAT THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF YOUR EVER AGAIN SEEING YOUR COUNTRY OR YOUR HOMES HE PAUSED
THE EXTENT OF DIMINUTION IN THE APPARENT DISC OF THE SUN DID NOT AFFORD SUFFICIENT BASIS EVEN FOR AN APPROXIMATE CALCULATION
THE GLORIOUS ORB THAT WAS BECOMING SO CONSPICUOUS AN OBJECT WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE PLANET JUPITER THE LARGEST OF ALL THE BODIES EXISTING WITHIN THE INFLUENCE OF SOLAR ATTRACTION
EVEN GERMANY MAY BE SAID TO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE PERSON OF THIS MISERABLE JEW AND EVEN IN HIM SAID SERVADAC PERHAPS WE SHALL NOT FIND SO INDIFFERENT A REPRESENTATIVE AS WE AT PRESENT IMAGINE CHAPTER XIX
THE NOONTIDE SUN WHICH USUALLY ILLUMINATED THE VARIOUS PROJECTIONS OF THE COAST WITH A DAZZLING BRIGHTNESS WAS HIDDEN BY A DENSE MASS OF CLOUD AND THE FOG WHICH FOR SOME UNACCOUNTABLE CAUSE HAD HUNG FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS OVER NEARLY EVERY REGION IN THE WORLD CAUSING SERIOUS INTERRUPTION TO TRAFFIC BETWEEN CONTINENT AND CONTINENT SPREAD ITS DREARY VEIL ACROSS LAND AND SEA
THERE WAS A FAINT SIGH FOLLOWED BY A FEEBLE VOICE WHICH UTTERED THE ONE WORD GALLIA YES YES
TO PRODUCE SO LARGE A COMBUSTION EITHER THE OXYGEN OF GALLIA'S ATMOSPHERE HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH THE EXPLOSIVE GASES CONTAINED BENEATH HER SOIL OR PERHAPS STILL MORE PROBABLE THE VOLCANO LIKE THOSE IN THE MOON WAS FED BY AN INTERNAL SUPPLY OF OXYGEN OF HER OWN
BIRDS INDEED THAT HAD MIGRATED IN SEARCH OF WARMER SHORES HAD RETURNED PROVING THAT THIS FRAGMENT OF THE FRENCH COLONY WAS THE ONLY SHRED OF LAND THAT COULD YIELD THEM ANY SUSTENANCE
BUT MEANWHILE HE KEPT A KEEN EYE UPON EVERY ARTICLE OF HIS PROPERTY AND AMIDST UNIVERSAL LAUGHTER INSISTED ON HAVING EVERY ITEM REGISTERED IN AN INVENTORY AS IT WAS TRANSFERRED TO ITS APPOINTED PLACE OF SAFETY
WHILST FRANCE ITSELF SUGGESTED A VIGOROUS TORSO WITH PARIS AT ITS BREAST
IT HAS CROSSED THE EARTH WITHOUT CRACKING IT IT IS POSSIBLE YOU MAY BE RIGHT SAID SERVADAC THOUGHTFULLY
I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DREAMED THAT I WAS A SWALLOW FLYING OVER THE MONTMARTRE BUT I NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING OF THIS KIND BEFORE
THE SUN HAD ALREADY REACHED THE EASTERN HORIZON AND JUST AS THOUGH IT WERE CROSSING THE ECLIPTIC UNDER THE TROPICS IT SANK LIKE A CANNON BALL INTO THE SEA
ONLY SAY YES OR NO--ARE YOU COMING WITH US INTO WINTER-QUARTERS GOD OF ISRAEL
ONE LARGE APARTMENT WELL HEATED AND VENTILATED WITH AS FEW CORNERS AS POSSIBLE IS CONSIDERED FAR MORE HEALTHY
IN THE COURSE OF THE CONVERSATION COUNT TIMASCHEFF TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING THAT AS CAPTAIN SERVADAC HAD ALREADY BEEN PRESENTED TO THE SPANIARDS AS GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND HE THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE THAT HE SHOULD REALLY ASSUME THAT POSITION
I NEED NO INSTRUCTION ON THESE POINTS PROCOPE AND TIMASCHEFF DEMURELY BOWED THEIR HEADS
TU SANDUNGA Y CIGARRO Y UNA CANA DE JEREZ MI JAMELGO Y UN TRABUCO QUE MAS GLORIA PUEDE HAVER SERVADAC'S KNOWLEDGE OF GASCON ENABLED HIM PARTIALLY TO COMPREHEND THE ROLLICKING TENOR OF THE SPANISH PATRIOTIC AIR BUT HIS ATTENTION WAS AGAIN ARRESTED BY THE VOICE OF THE OLD MAN GROWLING SAVAGELY PAY ME YOU SHALL
ONE OF THEM WAS NAMED NEGRETE AND HE AS HAVING TRAVELED SOMEWHAT MORE THAN THE REST WAS TACITLY RECOGNIZED AS A SORT OF LEADER
YOU DON'T MEAN EXCLAIMED THE PROFESSOR AGAIN GOING OFF INTO A PASSION THAT YOU HAVEN'T A PROPER MEASURE OF LENGTH BEN ZOOF WAS SENT OFF TO RANSACK THE STORES FOR THE ARTICLE IN QUESTION BUT NO MEASURE WAS FORTHCOMING
THE STEELYARD WAS COMMITTED TO THE KEEPING OF BEN ZOOF AND THE VISITORS PREPARED TO QUIT THE HANSA
THEY SET THEIR SAIL WITH ALL SPEED AND ERE LONG WERE ON THEIR JOURNEY BACK FROM FORMENTERA
A FURIOUS TEMPEST AROSE
I AM A POOR MAN
ONE INSTANT'S OBSTRUCTION AND STOPPAGE IN OUR PASSAGE AND OUR BALLOON IS BURNT TO ASHES
WHAT IS A MAN TO BELIEVE NOTE
BECAUSE I TELL YOU THE MASS OF GALLIA IS SO INFERIOR TO THAT OF THE MOON THAT GALLIA WOULD BECOME THE MOON'S SATELLITE
THERE WAS HOWEVER A STRONGER WILL THAN ISAAC HAKKABUT'S
MEANWHILE ROSETTE ASSUMED A POMPOUS PROFESSIONAL AIR AND APPEARED TO BE WAITING FOR THE ENTIRE PARTY TO BE CEREMONIOUSLY INTRODUCED TO HIM
SERVADAC WAS ON THE POINT OF MAKING SOME CUTTING RETORT BUT COUNT TIMASCHEFF WITHOUT ALLOWING THE INTERRUPTION TO BE NOTICED CALMLY CONTINUED HIS NARRATIVE
TELESCOPES IN HAND THE EXPLORERS FROM THE SUMMIT SCANNED THE SURROUNDING VIEW
WATER WAS ABUNDANT AND THE CISTERNS COULD HARDLY FAIL TO BE REPLENISHED BY THE NUMEROUS STREAMS THAT MEANDERED ALONG THE PLAINS
HE COULD NOT TELL INTO WHOSE HANDS THE MESSAGE WOULD FALL FIRST WELL THEN SAID COUNT TIMASCHEFF WE SEEM TO HAVE FOUND A NAME FOR THE NEW WORLD WE OCCUPY BUT WHAT I WAS GOING ESPECIALLY TO OBSERVE CONTINUED THE LIEUTENANT IS THAT THE DISTANCE 59,000,000 LEAGUES REPRESENTS PRECISELY THE DISTANCE WE OURSELVES WERE FROM THE SUN ON THE 15TH
SERVADAC AND THE COUNT CONTINUED TO GAZE UPON THE EARTH WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT ALMOST AMOUNTED TO AWE
SATISFIED WITH HIS SCRUTINY OF BEN ZOOF'S FACE THE PROFESSOR WENT ON
TEN TIMES MORE PROBABLE THAT FRANCE FRANCE SHOUTED SERVADAC IN A PASSION
HE SECURED THE SERVICES OF A FORMER ASSISTANT AND DISPATCHED HIM TO A HIGH PEAK ON THE COAST OF SPAIN WHERE HE HAD TO SUPERINTEND A REVERBERATOR WHICH WITH THE AID OF A GLASS COULD BE SEEN FROM FORMENTERA
PERHAPS YOU AND I HAD BETTER ADOPT HER AY YES ASSENTED THE ORDERLY
AS GENTLY AND CAUTIOUSLY AS HE COULD HE EXPRESSED HIS FEAR THAT THEY MIGHT NEVER SEE EUROPE FRANCE PARIS MONTMARTRE AGAIN
GALLIA'S GOVERNOR GENERAL THE SPANIARDS WHO HAD ARRIVED ON BOARD THE HANSA CONSISTED OF NINE MEN AND A LAD OF TWELVE YEARS OF AGE NAMED PABLO
AT OTHER TIMES THEY WOULD BE LIKE A SEMI-AUREOLE OF LIGHT
BEN ZOOF WATCHES IN VAIN IN A FEW MINUTES THE GOVERNOR GENERAL AND HIS POPULATION WERE ASLEEP
I AM SUPERINTENDENT OF THE COMMISSARIAT DEPARTMENT
THE SHIPS WERE GONE AND THEY HAD ONLY A BALLOON TO REPLACE THEM
NOTES WOULD HOLD GOOD WHEN THEY GOT BACK AGAIN TO THE EARTH
THE TWO CHILDREN MUFFLED UP IN FURS LOOKING LIKE LITTLE ESQUIMEAUX SKATED ALONG TOGETHER PABLO EVER AT HIS COMPANION'S SIDE READY TO GIVE HER A HELPING HAND WHENEVER SHE WAS WEARY WITH HER EXERTIONS
WE ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH WELL-NIGH ALL THESE EXTRAORDINARY FACTS
I NEVER MAKE AN ERROR
BY THE 20TH ALL PRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENTS WERE COMPLETE AND EVERYTHING READY FOR A FINAL DEPARTURE FROM THE ISLAND
THE GENERAL RE-ARRANGEMENT OF THE NEW RESIDENCE WAS NO EASY BUSINESS AND OCCUPIED SO MUCH TIME THAT THE END OF JANUARY ARRIVED BEFORE THEY COULD BE SAID TO BE FAIRLY SETTLED
A CRY FROM BEN ZOOF RECALLED HIM TO HIMSELF
SERVADAC BEGAN TO KNOCK WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
AND CAPELLA 340 MILLIONS OF MILLIONS OF MILES A FIGURE REPRESENTED BY NO LESS THAN FIFTEEN DIGITS
LISTEN TO ME MY FRIENDS
BUT SERVADAC AND HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD ALREADY DIVINED THE PROFESSOR'S MEANING
LET US SECURE THAT AND ALL MAY BE WELL
BUONAPARTE WHEN UNDER THE DIRECTORY ONCE HAD HIS ATTENTION CALLED TO VENUS AT NOON AND IMMEDIATELY HAILED IT JOYFULLY RECOGNIZING IT AS HIS OWN PECULIAR STAR IN THE ASCENDANT
NO SPOT COULD HAVE BEEN CHOSEN MORE SUITABLE FOR THE MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO ADVERSARIES
HE ASSERTED THAT HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM GOURBI ISLAND ONLY TO BE PLUNDERED
THE LAST OBSERVATION HOWEVER WAS ENTIRELY LOST UPON THE PROFESSOR WHO HAD LEFT THE HALL WITH AN AIR ALMOST MAJESTIC AND WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO THE OBSERVATORY
AT BREAKFAST THAT MORNING THE COLONEL OBSERVED TO THE MAJOR THAT HE WAS UNDER THE MOST DECIDED IMPRESSION THAT THE 18TH OF FEBRUARY WAS A ROYAL ANNIVERSARY
SHE MAY OR SHE MAY NOT CARRY OFF A PORTION OF THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE AND SUBSTANCE AND SO SHE MAY FLOAT AWAY AGAIN INTO SPACE
IT WOULD NOT BE MORE STRANGE THAN THE OTHER PHENOMENA WHICH WE HAVE LATELY WITNESSED
NEITHER DID PALMYRIN ROSETTE FIND LEISURE TO TAKE ANY SHARE IN THE MUTUAL INTERCOURSE
ON THE DISCOVERY OF EACH DELINQUENCY HE WOULD FUME AND RAGE IN A MANNER THAT WAS A SOURCE OF UNBOUNDED DELIGHT TO HIS AUDIENCE
BUT THE CAPTAIN DREW THE MOST FAVORABLE CONCLUSIONS FROM ROSETTE'S CONTINUED IRRITATION
BESIDES IT WAS ADVISABLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME ONE LEFT TO RECEIVE ANY STRANGERS THAT MIGHT POSSIBLY ARRIVE AS WELL AS TO KEEP AN EYE UPON THE HERDS OF CATTLE WHICH IN THE DUBIOUS PROSPECT BEFORE THEM MIGHT PROVE TO BE THE SOLE RESOURCE OF THE SURVIVORS OF THE CATASTROPHE
IN ANY CASE IT SEEMS HARD TO FORESEE WHENCE THERE IS TO COME THE FAINTEST CHANCE OF DELIVERANCE IS THE CASE SO DESPERATE ASKED SERVADAC
REMARKABLY SIMILAR IN PERSONAL APPEARANCE THEY WERE HARDLY LESS SO IN PERSONAL CHARACTER
HAKKABUT RAISED NO OBJECTION NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS AWARE THAT THE MOVE INSURED THE IMMEDIATE SAFETY OF HIS TARTAN BUT BECAUSE HE WAS SECRETLY ENTERTAINING THE HOPE THAT HE MIGHT ENTICE AWAY TWO OR THREE OF THE DOBRYNA'S CREW AND MAKE HIS ESCAPE TO ALGIERS OR SOME OTHER PORT
GET BACK REJOINED ROSETTE SHARPLY
I SHALL BE RUINED MOANED ISAAC IN DESPAIR
CAPTAIN SERVADAC GAVE OLD ISAAC FULL PERMISSION TO TAKE UP HIS RESIDENCE AMONGST THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY PROMISED HIM THE ENTIRE CONTROL OVER HIS OWN PROPERTY AND ALTOGETHER SHOWED HIM SO MUCH CONSIDERATION THAT BUT FOR HIS UNBOUNDED RESPECT FOR HIS MASTER BEN ZOOF WOULD HAVE LIKED TO REPRIMAND HIM FOR HIS COURTESY TO A MAN WHOM HE SO CORDIALLY DESPISED
COUNT WASSILI TIMASCHEFF ON BOARD THE SCHOONER DOBRYNA IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO ARRANGE THAT SECONDS SHOULD BE APPOINTED WHO WOULD MEET IN MOSTAGANEM AT TWO O'CLOCK THAT DAY
BIRDS SUBSISTING ONLY ON SCRAPS THROWN OUT TO THEM DID NOT CEASE TO FOLLOW THE POPULATION IN ITS MIGRATION AND SO NUMEROUS DID THEY BECOME THAT MULTITUDES OF THEM HAD REPEATEDLY TO BE DESTROYED
AS THEY WENT THEY DISCUSSED THEIR SITUATION
CAPTAIN SERVADAC WHO IN COMMON WITH THE COUNT REALLY LIKED THEM BOTH CONCEIVED THAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF A PARENT IN SOME DEGREE HAD DEVOLVED UPON HIM AND TOOK GREAT CARE IN SUPERINTENDING THEIR DAILY LESSONS WHICH HE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING HARDLY LESS PLEASANT THAN THEIR SPORTS
CHAPTER X
CHAPTER X
WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER SO WELL THAT I FEEL SURE WE SHALL TRY AND WORK TOGETHER FOR THE COMMON GOOD
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE REST OF ALGERIA
THERE WAS PLENTY TO DO
THE IMPERIAL FORT TOO WAS BUILT UPON AN ELEVATION OF 750 FEET
NAY WAS IT NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT HE HAD ALREADY ESTIMATED WITH SUFFICIENT APPROXIMATION TO TRUTH WHAT WAS TO BE THE TRUE LENGTH OF THE GALLIAN YEAR
WHILST EXAMINING THE ROCKY SHORE THE CAPTAIN OBSERVED TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE LONG AND WELL-DEFINED ROWS OF SEAWEED WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY BETOKENED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A VERY CONSIDERABLE EBB AND FLOW OF THE WATERS--A THING UNKNOWN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHERE THERE IS SCARCELY ANY PERCEPTIBLE TIDE
THEN SLACKENING THEIR SPEED THEY PROCEEDED AT A MORE LEISURELY PACE TO THE SOUTHEAST ALONG WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN THE RIGHT BANK OF THE RIVER BUT WHICH ALTHOUGH IT STILL RETAINED ITS FORMER CHARACTERISTICS WAS NOW THE BOUNDARY OF A SEA WHICH EXTENDING FARTHER THAN THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON MUST HAVE SWALLOWED UP AT LEAST A LARGE PORTION OF THE PROVINCE OF ORAN
39,000,000 L
THE MEN WHO WERE THUS BEGUILING THEIR LEISURE WERE TWO OFFICERS IN THE BRITISH ARMY--COLONEL HENEAGE FINCH MURPHY AND MAJOR SIR JOHN TEMPLE OLIPHANT
WHAT MEANS ALL THIS HE MURMURED
TO-MORROW MY DEAR PROCOPE TO-MORROW WE WILL EXPLORE IT ALL
AND IN SPITE OF EVERY EXERTION TO GET HIM AWAY HE CLUNG MOST TENACIOUSLY TO THE PROFESSOR'S CHAIR AND AGAIN AND AGAIN IMPLORED FOR NEWS OF EUROPE
BUT THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THEM ALL WAS AT STAKE AND THE DESIGN MUST BE EXECUTED RESOLUTELY
BUT HOW ABOUT THE APHELION
GALLIA HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU
MY MODEST LITTLE FORTUNE--A MERE BAGATELLE SAID THE JEW
AND IN THE SAME DEGREE AS THIS WAS A MATTER OF SANGUINE ANTICIPATION TO CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND HIS FRIENDS IT WAS A MATTER OF AVERSION TO THE ASTRONOMICAL ENTHUSIAST WHO HAD NO DESIRE TO QUIT HIS PRESENT QUARTERS IN A SPHERE WHICH BEING OF HIS OWN DISCOVERY HE COULD HARDLY HAVE CARED FOR MORE IF IT HAD BEEN OF HIS OWN CREATION
RANK CAPTAIN ON THE STAFF AT MOSTAGANEM
PRAY GENTLEMEN DO NOT INTERRUPT ME SAID THE PROFESSOR AUTHORITATIVELY AS IF EX CATHEDRA
BE CONTENTED WITH EUROPEAN PRICES
THE SCHEME SEEMS TENABLE
THAT THE EARTH GROANED AS THOUGH THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK OF THE GLOBE WERE RUPTURED
BUT ALTHOUGH HIS ATTENDANT WAS ON THE ALERT TO GATHER ALL HE COULD HE WAS ABLE TO CATCH NOTHING IN THE INCOHERENT SENTENCES THAT SERVED TO THROW ANY REAL LIGHT UPON THE PROBLEM THAT THEY WERE ALL EAGER TO SOLVE
BUT HE WOULD BE EVEN WITH THEM YET
SO YOU MAY GO ABOUT YOUR OWN BUSINESS WAS THE CAPTAIN'S BRUSQUE REJOINDER
HERE SIR WAS THE PROMPT REPLY
BILLS FROM HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR WOULD BE GOOD BILLS
IN PROPORTION TO THE RISE OF TEMPERATURE THE LIGHT ALSO ASSUMED GREATER INTENSITY
BUT HIS INGRAINED PROPENSITY FOR MAKING A GOOD BARGAIN PROMPTED HIM TO ADD PROVIDED YOU DO NOT OVERCHARGE ME BEN ZOOF WAS ABOUT AGAIN TO INTERPOSE SOME ANGRY EXCLAMATION
I SAY REPEATED ROSETTE
ENGLAND I FEAR HAS SUFFERED GRIEVOUSLY BY THE LATE CATASTROPHE
HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM
THROUGHOUT THIS TIME THE EARTH HAD BEEN MAKING A PERCEPTIBLE APPROACH TOWARDS MERCURY AND THAT PLANET--WHICH IS RARELY VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE AND THEN ONLY AT WHAT ARE TERMED THE PERIODS OF ITS GREATEST EASTERN AND WESTERN ELONGATIONS--NOW APPEARED IN ALL ITS SPLENDOR
SERVADAC SAW IT AND GAVE HIS ORDERLY A SIGN THAT HE SHOULD DESIST ENTIRELY FROM HIS BANTERING
TWO YEARS AT L'ECOLE D'APPLICATION
BEFORE THEY STARTED PROFESSOR ROSETTE REQUESTED THAT ONE OF THE MEN MIGHT BE ORDERED TO CUT HIM A CUBIC DECIMETER OUT OF THE SOLID SUBSTANCE OF GALLIA
MY ENGINEER IS THE MAN FOR THAT SAID THE COUNT
BUT CHEER UP SIR CHEER UP
THERE WAS A SHORT SILENCE AT THE END OF WHICH SERVADAC ANNOUNCED THAT THE VOLUME OF THE COMET WAS 47,880,000 CUBIC MILES
FRANCE LIES BEYOND DISEMBARKATION HOWEVER WAS AN UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY
ONE MOMENT YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID HAKKABUT SIDLING UP WITH A HYPOCRITICAL SMILE
WAS I NOT RIGHT
AND HOW CAN WE CEMENT THE BOND THAT OUGHT TO UNITE US BETTER THAN BY CELEBRATING IN COMMON WITH OUR FELLOW-CREATURES UPON EARTH A DAY THAT AWAKENS AFRESH THE KINDLIEST SENTIMENTS OF ALL
IN HIS ASCENT HE PASSED BEN ZOOF WHO HAD ALREADY COMMENCED HIS DOWNWARD COURSE
WHEN BEN ZOOF AND NEGRETE HAD EXTRICATED THEIR PATIENT FROM THE ENVELOPE OF FURS IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN WRAPPED BY SERVADAC AND THE LIEUTENANT THEY FOUND THEMSELVES FACE TO FACE WITH A SHRIVELLED LITTLE MAN ABOUT FIVE FEET TWO INCHES HIGH WITH A ROUND BALD HEAD SMOOTH AND SHINY AS AN OSTRICH'S EGG NO BEARD UNLESS THE UNSHORN GROWTH OF A WEEK COULD BE SO DESCRIBED AND A LONG HOOKED NOSE THAT SUPPORTED A HUGE PAIR OF SPECTACLES SUCH AS WITH MANY NEAR-SIGHTED PEOPLE SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME A PART OF THEIR INDIVIDUALITY
ONE DAY IN THE ENVIRONS OF MONTMARTRE WHERE THEY WERE SECURE FROM EAVESDROPPERS BEN ZOOF INCIDENTALLY REFERRED TO THE EXPERIENCES IN THE DEPTHS OF NINA'S HIVE
THE BIT OF GIBRALTAR OCCUPIED BY THE ENGLISHMEN
WAS NOT GALLIA WHEN ITS PATHWAY LED IT INTO SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THIS ENORMOUS PLANET RUNNING A RISK OF BEING ATTRACTED WITHIN ITS INFLUENCE
NOT A MOMENT WAS TO BE LOST IN GETTING THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTRONOMER AWAY FROM HIS DESOLATE QUARTERS
FAR LA RIRA TOUR TALA RIRE TOUR LA RIBAUD RICANDEAU SANS REPOS REPIT REPIT REPOS RIS POT RIPETTE
I CAN TELL YOU IT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT UP YOUR BIT OF A COMET AND WORN IT LIKE A FEATHER IN A CAP THE PROFESSOR LOOKED ANGRY AND SERVADAC HAVING IMPOSED SILENCE UPON HIS ORDERLY EXPLAINED THE WORTHY SOLDIER'S SENSITIVENESS ON ALL THAT CONCERNED MONTMARTRE
THE FIRST TAKES ONLY L DAY 18 HOURS 27 MINUTES
AND ACCIDENTS SUCH AS SO FREQUENTLY MAR PUBLIC REJOICINGS WERE ALL HAPPILY AVOIDED
AND MERCURY NEAREST OF ALL AND YOUNGEST OF ALL HAS BEEN REVOLVING AT A DISTANCE OF 35,393,000 MILES FOR THE SPACE OF 10,000,000 YEARS--THE SAME TIME AS THE MOON HAS BEEN EVOLVED FROM THE EARTH SERVADAC LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
IN FACT IT HAD ALREADY HEELED OVER TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO RENDER IT QUITE DANGEROUS FOR ITS OBSTINATE OWNER WHO AT THE PERIL OF HIS LIFE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD STAY WHERE HE COULD WATCH OVER HIS ALL-PRECIOUS CARGO THOUGH CONTINUALLY INVOKING CURSES ON THE ILL-FATE OF WHICH HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE VICTIM
THE NEXT QUESTION OF ANXIETY WAS WHERE WOULD THE BALLOON ALIGHT
THE LITTLE PROFESSOR MOST COMICAL OF ALL RESEMBLED NOTHING SO MUCH AS THE CUB OF AN ARCTIC BEAR
WHEN WE HEAR HIS STORY YOU SHALL HEAR IT TOO AND I HOPE IT WILL BE TO YOUR LIKING OLD EZEKIEL ADDED BEN ZOOF IN A VOICE OF IRONY
UP TILL THIS TIME NO CASUALTIES HAD DIMINISHED THEIR ORIGINAL NUMBER BUT TO UNDERTAKE SO LONG A JOURNEY ACROSS THAT UNSHELTERED EXPANSE OF ICE COULD SCARCELY FAIL TO RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SOME OF THEIR PARTY
DEATH IN THE CRUELLEST OF ALL SHAPES SEEMED STARING THEM IN THE FACE--DEATH FROM COLD
THE ENGLISHMEN RIGHTLY ENOUGH HAD CONTINUED TO OCCUPY THE FRAGMENT OF GIBRALTAR AND THEIR CLAIM WAS INDISPUTABLE
IT IS NICE AND WARM ALTHOUGH THEY WERE AS CAREFUL AS THEY COULD TO CONCEAL THEIR MISGIVINGS FROM THE REST SERVADAC AND HIS TWO FRIENDS COULD NOT REGARD THEIR PRESENT SITUATION WITHOUT DISTRUST
THE CONCLUDING LINE WITH ITS INTIMATION OF FAILING PROVISIONS AMOUNTED ALMOST TO AN APPEAL FOR HELP
CONSIDER IT IS THE ONLY STEELYARD IN ALL THIS NEW WORLD OF OURS
BUT THERE WAS LITTLE TIME FOR SERVADAC TO EXAMINE THE CHANGES WHICH A FEW HOURS HAD WROUGHT
BUT NEITHER SKILL NOR COURAGE NOR OBEDIENCE COULD AVAIL
SUCH WAS THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NARRATIVE WHICH THE PROFESSOR GAVE WITH SUNDRY REPETITIONS AND DIGRESSIONS
TO BE SURE HE WILL
THE DISCUSSION OVER THIS MISHAP LED TO MUTUAL RECRIMINATIONS TILL THE SAILORS HAD ALMOST COME TO BLOWS WITH THE GARRISON
THE HANSA HAD WEIGHED ANCHOR ON THE 3RD OF FEBRUARY
HOW STUPID
NEGRETE INTERRUPTED HIM BY DECLARING THAT NO PROMISES OR PLEDGES COULD BE GIVEN UNTIL HE AND HIS COUNTRYMEN KNEW HOW SOON THEY COULD BE SENT BACK TO SPAIN
IS IT POSSIBLE HE EXCLAIMED
SEVERAL EXCURSIONS WERE MADE ALONG THE SHORE AND FOR A RADIUS OF THREE OR FOUR MILES THE ADJACENT DISTRICT WAS CAREFULLY EXPLORED
BUT THE UNFORTUNATE ISRAELITE TRIED HARD TO SPEAK BUT HIS AGITATION PREVENTED HIM
FOR THE AIR BECOMING MORE AND MORE RAREFIED MADE RESPIRATION SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT AND THE ASCENT FATIGUING
YOU OUGHT TO THINK YOURSELF LUCKY IN GETTING ANY PRICE AT ALL
THAT WILL NEVER DO OBJECTED THE ORDERLY
BUT THE JOKE AT AN END HE TOOK CARE THAT THE JEW WAS PROPERLY PAID ALL HIS LEGITIMATE DUE
TO LIEUTENANT PROCOPE HIMSELF WAS ENTRUSTED THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MONTGOLFIER AND THE WORK WAS BEGUN AT ONCE
NO SHE ANSWERED
BY THE APPOINTED TIME THE ENGINEER HAD FINISHED HIS TASK AND WITH ALL DUE CARE HAD PREPARED A CUBIC DECIMETER OF THE MATERIAL OF THE COMET
YOU SEE HAKKABUT I WAS RIGHT
HERE IT RECORDED A DIFFERENT VALUE ALTOGETHER AS THE RESULT OF THE ALTERED FORCE OF GRAVITY
BUT NO SOONER WOULD THEIR HAYMAKING AND THEIR CORN HARVEST HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THAN THEY WOULD BE COMPELLED AGAIN LIKE A SWARM OF BEES TO RETIRE TO THEIR SEMI-TROGLODYTE EXISTENCE IN THE CELLS OF NINA'S HIVE
A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FRANCS SAID THE JEW
STILL NOT A SINGLE RESORT FOR REFUGE DID THE INACCESSIBLE SHORE PRESENT
BUT BY ALL THE POWERS
HERE THE THERMOMETER REGISTERED 12 DEGREES ABOVE ZERO--A TEMPERATURE WHICH IF ONLY IT WERE PERMANENT WAS ALL THEY WANTED
FRANCE IS AN INTEGRAL PORTION OF A SOLID CONTINENT
HEAVEN HELPS THEM THAT HELP THEMSELVES AND WHAT MEANS HAVE YOU TO SUGGEST MAY I ASK SAID THE COUNT WITH A FAINT ACCENT OF SATIRE
IN ONE RESPECT THEY CONGRATULATED THEMSELVES THAT THEY SHOULD BE BETTER OFF THAN MANY OF THE WHALERS IN THE POLAR SEAS FOR AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET BELOW THE SURFACE OF A FROZEN OCEAN THESE ADVENTURERS HAVE TO SEEK REFUGE IN HUTS OF WOOD AND SNOW ERECTED ON THEIR SHIPS WHICH AT BEST CAN GIVE BUT SLIGHT PROTECTION FROM EXTREME COLD
TO ROSETTE WHO WITHOUT FAMILY TIES WHICH HE HAD NEVER FOUND LEISURE OR INCLINATION TO CONTRACT HAD NO SHADOW OF DESIRE TO RETURN TO THE EARTH IT WOULD BE ONLY THE FIRST OF THESE PROBABILITIES THAT COULD GIVE HIM ANY CONCERN
FOOD WAS BOTH WHOLESOME AND ABUNDANT AND BESIDES THE FURS BROUGHT FROM THE DOBRYNA'S STORES FRESH SKINS COULD VERY EASILY BE PROCURED AND MADE UP INTO WEARING APPAREL
ONLY FOR ONE DAY ADDED THE PROFESSOR
AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE SCREEN OF VAPOR INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE SKY AND THE ISLAND THE IRRADIATION WHICH WOULD HAVE ILLUMINED ALL TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS WOULD HAVE BEEN VIVID BEYOND ALL PRECEDENT
AND AS IT WAS UNDENIABLE THAT IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE OF NO SERVICE DEEP DOWN IN THE BOWELS OF THE MOUNTAIN IT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN UNDISTURBED UPON ITS TRIPOD IN THE GREAT HALL OF NINA'S HIVE
THE CAPTAIN BECAME EXASPERATED
LABORIOUS OR NOT IT HAS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
THE EARTH IS MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF LEAGUES AWAY AND IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE MOON HAS CEASED TO REVOLVE ABOUT HER WHY NOT REMONSTRATED SERVADAC
HIS MEALS WERE TAKEN TO HIM AT STATED INTERVALS
IN DUE TIME THE 62D APRIL ACCORDING TO THE REVISED GALLIAN CALENDAR DAWNED
THEY WERE VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE
THE PROFESSOR RESUMED
WHAT IN THE NAME OF PEACE DO YOU MEAN BAWLED BEN ZOOF IN OPEN-MOUTHED AMAZEMENT
IT MUST BE OWNED THAT THE WHOLE PARTY WERE FAR FROM SORRY TO BE RELIEVED OF HIS PRESENCE
HIS OWN SECRET PRESENTIMENT SO THOROUGHLY COINCIDED WITH THE DOUBTS EXPRESSED BY THE COUNT THAT HE REFRAINED FROM SAYING ANOTHER WORD
THE MOON
AND ACCORDINGLY HE SHOULD RATHER BE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE MESSAGE HAD BEEN SET AFLOAT BY SOME SAVANT LEFT ALONE PERCHANCE UPON SOME ISOLATED COAST
ALL OVER WITH US SIR SAID PROCOPE TO THE COUNT
THE FIRST CHANGE THAT CAME UNDER THEIR OBSERVATION WAS THE RAPIDITY OF THE SUN'S APPEARANCES AND DISAPPEARANCES FORCING THEM TO THE CONVICTION THAT ALTHOUGH THE COMET STILL ROTATED ON ITS AXIS FROM EAST TO WEST YET THE PERIOD OF ITS ROTATION HAD BEEN DIMINISHED BY ABOUT ONE-HALF
SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE HAD NO PARENTS AND HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN TAKING CARE OF A FLOCK OF GOATS BELONGING TO ONE OF THE LANDOWNERS WHEN ONE DAY ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYTHING AROUND HER EXCEPT THIS LITTLE PIECE OF LAND HAD BEEN SWALLOWED UP AND THAT SHE AND MARZY HER PET GOAT HAD BEEN LEFT QUITE ALONE
MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF BOTH COLONEL MURPHY AND MAJOR OLIPHANT THE EFFECT OF THE SALUTE FELL ALTOGETHER SHORT OF THEIR ANTICIPATIONS
THE PRACTICAL TEST OF THESE CONCLUSIONS WOULD BE MADE BY FUTURE INVESTIGATION BUT MEANWHILE THE FACT APPEARED VERY MUCH TO STRENGTHEN THE PRESUMPTION THAT IF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE HAD NOT ARRIVED AT THE WHOLE TRUTH HE HAD MADE A CONSIDERABLE ADVANCE TOWARDS IT
A MONTH PASSED AWAY BUT SERVADAC FOUND NO OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING AT THE INFORMATION HE HAD PLEDGED HIMSELF TO GAIN
NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT SIR REPLIED BEN ZOOF
AFTER CONSIDERABLE HESITATION BUT STILL KEEPING HIS HOLD UPON THE CABIN-DOOR THE JEW MADE UP HIS MIND TO STEP OUTSIDE
THIS NOW REGISTERED 53 DEGREES BELOW FREEZING-POINT
WE MUST SOMEHOW HAVE MISTAKEN OUR BEARINGS
WHY THERE'S NOT A RUSSIAN COULD ENDURE IT I BEG YOUR PARDON COUNT
ARE WE NOT THEN IN CORFU THEY ASKED
ALL BEHIND
NOT MERELY HAD THERE BEEN A SUBMERSION OF THE LAND BUT THE IMPRESSION WAS MORE AND MORE CONFIRMED THAT THE VERY BOWELS OF THE EARTH MUST HAVE YAWNED AND CLOSED AGAIN UPON A LARGE TERRITORY
ON THE 4TH OF JANUARY BY PERSEVERING INDUSTRY THE PROCESS OF BORING WAS COMPLETED AND THE LIEUTENANT COULD HEAR THAT FRAGMENTS OF THE BLASTED ROCK AS THE SAILORS CLEARED THEM AWAY WITH THEIR SPADES WERE ROLLING INTO THE FUNNEL OF THE CRATER
WOULD GALLIA BE DIVERTED FROM ITS PROPER WAY
OF THIS HOWEVER THERE WAS NOW NO TRACE
SILENCE CRIED THE CAPTAIN
AND AS COUNT TIMASCHEFF JUSTLY REMARKED SINCE IT WAS THE ONLY BURNING MOUNTAIN THEY HAD SIGHTED IT WAS MOST PROBABLY THE SOLE OUTLET FOR GALLIA'S SUBTERRANEAN FIRES AND CONSEQUENTLY THE ERUPTION MIGHT CONTINUE UNCHANGED FOR AGES TO COME
HIS FARTHER EFFORTS WERE UNAVAILING AND WHEN AT SIX O'CLOCK HE REACHED THE GOURBI THE FOUR LINES STILL REMAINED THE LIMIT OF HIS COMPOSITION
EUROPEAN PRICES WILL NOT DO FOR ME
YOUR EXCELLENCY THEY OWE ME TWENTY REALS APIECE FOR THEIR PASSAGE HERE
IT HAD IN FACT ALREADY LASTED SOME MONTHS--THE PLAYERS BEING SO DELIBERATE AND SO FEARFUL OF TAKING A STEP WITHOUT THE MOST MATURE CONSIDERATION THAT EVEN NOW THEY WERE ONLY MAKING THE TWENTIETH MOVE
COME ON HE CRIED CHEERILY HIS VOICE RINGING THROUGH THE DARKNESS COME ON
IN A FEW MINUTES THE COMMANDING OFFICER ATTIRED IN FULL UNIFORM WAS SEEN DESCENDING TO THE SHORE
ON THE 24TH OF FEBRUARY AFTER FOLLOWING THE SINUOUS COURSE OF WHAT BEFORE THE DATE OF THE CONVULSION HAD BEEN THE COAST LINE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VAR AND AFTER A FRUITLESS SEARCH FOR HYERES THE PENINSULA OF ST TROPEZ THE LERIUS ISLANDS AND THE GULFS OF CANNES AND JOUAR THE DOBRYNA ARRIVED UPON THE SITE OF THE CAPE OF ANTIBES
LEAVING THE CHILDREN TO ENTERTAIN EACH OTHER CAPTAIN SERVADAC BEGAN HIS ADDRESS
THE MORE REMOTE THAT THESE PLANETS ARE FROM THE SUN SAID PROCOPE THE MORE VENERABLE AND ADVANCED IN FORMATION ARE THEY FOUND TO BE
AND NEXT MORNING A REGULAR SCHEME OF LIFE WAS DEFINITELY LAID DOWN
THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF THE JOURNEY BECAME MORE AND MORE APPARENT
A VERY SHORT INSPECTION SUFFICED TO MAKE THEM AWARE THAT BOTH THE TARTAN AND HER CARGO WERE IN A PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION
IT SEEMED THEREFORE MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT A SIMILAR FATE HAD OVERTAKEN THE LARGER TOWNS BEYOND THE SHELIF
IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK BEFORE THE FESTIVITIES CAME TO AN END AND BY THAT TIME THE COMPANY HEATED BY THE HIGH TEMPERATURE OF THE HALL AND BY THEIR OWN EXERTIONS FELT THE WANT OF A LITTLE FRESH AIR
UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HIS ELEVATED POSITION WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HIM A RADIUS OF VISION AT LEAST FIVE AND TWENTY MILES IN LENGTH
IT WAS HALF-PAST TWELVE WHEN THE TWO RIDERS CROSSED THE BRIDGE THAT HAD BEEN RECENTLY ERECTED OVER THE SHELIF AND A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER THEIR STEEDS FLECKED WITH FOAM DASHED THROUGH THE MASCARA GATE WHICH WAS ONE OF FIVE ENTRANCES OPENED IN THE EMBATTLED WALL THAT ENCIRCLED THE TOWN
ALL EYES IN A MOMENT WERE RIVETED UPON HIM AS WITH HIS HEAD RESTING ON HIS HANDS HE WAS MANIFESTLY COGITATING A NEW IDEA
WHEN EVERY ONE EXCEPT THE CAPTAIN AND HIS ORDERLY HAD TAKEN THEIR PLACES SERVADAC SAID GET IN BEN ZOOF AFTER YOU SIR SAID BEN ZOOF RESPECTFULLY
FRANCE IS NOT AN ISLAND THAT CAN BE SUBMERGED
NOT THAT ANY DOUBT WAS ENTERTAINED AS TO THEIR HAVING BEEN ABLE SUCCESSFULLY TO COPE WITH THE RIGORS OF THE WINTER
SOME OF HIS GOODS WERE BEGINNING TO SPOIL AND HE FELT THE NECESSITY OF TURNING THEM INTO MONEY IF HE WOULD NOT BE A LOSER
PRESENTLY HE ROUSED HIMSELF AND BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT AGAIN
WHETHER IT HAD CARRIED WITH IT ANY PORTION OF ATMOSPHERE WHETHER IT POSSESSED ANY OTHER CONDITION FOR SUPPORTING LIFE AND WHETHER IT WAS LIKELY EVER AGAIN TO APPROACH TO THE EARTH WERE ALL QUESTIONS THAT THERE WERE NO MEANS OF DETERMINING
BUT OF THIS TOO THERE WAS NOW NO TRACE
TELL US HAVE YOU HAD NO COMMUNICATION AT ALL FROM EUROPE?--NO NEWS OF ANY SORT FROM LONDON HITHERTO NONE WHATEVER REPLIED THE COLONEL
AND IF SAID THE LIEUTENANT AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE AND THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE FROWN AT THE INTERRUPTION--"AND IF THE COLLISION SHOULD OCCUR AT OUR ANTIPODES THE SUDDEN CHECK TO THE VELOCITY OF THE COMET WOULD BE QUITE EQUIVALENT TO A SHOCK IN SITU
PROBABLY THEY WOULD HAVE FELT NO SURPRISE IF THEY HAD BEEN TOLD THAT ANGLO-SAXONS WERE FASHIONED OUT OF SOME SPECIFIC CLAY THE PROPERTIES OF WHICH SURPASSED THE INVESTIGATION OF CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
ALL IS NOT OVER YET
BUT WHEN SHE FOUND THAT THE EARTH DID NOT SHAKE ANY MORE SHE HAD THANKED THE GREAT GOD AND HAD SOON MADE HERSELF VERY HAPPY LIVING WITH MARZY
QUITE IMPOSSIBLE REPLIED BEN ZOOF EXCEPT YOU HAD GONE BY A BOAT
IT IS NOTHING BUT A WATERSPOUT VERY GOOD SIR WAS THE PHILOSOPHICAL REPLY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THE QUERY ANY BONES BROKEN SIR NONE WHATEVER SAID THE CAPTAIN
HITHER WAS ALSO BROUGHT THE SCHOONER'S LIBRARY CONTAINING A GOOD VARIETY OF FRENCH AND RUSSIAN BOOKS
THIS SINCE IT HAD CEASED TO BE FORMED BY THE ORIGINAL RIVER BANK HAD CONSIDERABLY ALTERED ITS ASPECT
SERVADAC HAD SAVED BEN ZOOF'S LIFE IN JAPAN
AND COLONEL MURPHY AND MAJOR OLIPHANT WOULD HAVE HAD LEISURE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR SOLVING THE MOST ABSTRUSE PROBLEMS OF THE CHESS-BOARD
WE MUST INQUIRE INTO THIS TO-MORROW HE EXCLAIMED AS DARKNESS FELL SUDDENLY UPON HIM
HE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT HE WAS NOT DREAMING AND YET WAS POWERLESS TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY
AND THE FAIR IMAGE THAT HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF THEIR ORIGINAL RIVALRY WAS EVER RISING AS A VISION BETWEEN THEM
IT WAS IN TRUTH THE VERY SPOT ON WHICH TRADITION ASSERTS THAT THE CANONIZED MONARCH CAME TO DIE A SPOT TO WHICH FOR SIX CENTURIES AND MORE HIS COUNTRYMEN HAD PAID THE HOMAGE OF A PIOUS REGARD
BY THE GOD WHO IS THAT ASKED THE STARTLED PROFESSOR
BEN ZOOF WAS AS A MATTER OF COURSE ALLOWED TO BE PRESENT AND PROFESSOR ROSETTE HAD BEEN ASKED TO ATTEND
BUT PROFESSOR ROSETTE DID NOT CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THREE POSITIONS
THE EIGHTEEN MILES BETWEEN THE ISLAND AND THE HEADLAND WERE MADE IN SOMETHING LESS THAN THREE HOURS
THE DEVIATION HOWEVER WAS NOT GREAT
TWO HOURS LATER THEY HAD RETURNED
TAKING UP THE EGGS HE WAS SURPRISED TO NOTICE THAT THEY HARDLY WEIGHED MORE THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY HAD BEEN MERE SHELLS
BUT DURING PERIODS OF CALM WEATHER WHEN THE AIR HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY STILL MANY POLAR NAVIGATORS WELL-CLOTHED AND PROPERLY FED HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO WITHSTAND A TEMPERATURE WHEN THE THERMOMETER HAS FALLEN TO 60 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
BY ASCENDING ONE DAY TO THE SUMMIT OF THE VOLCANO CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND THE COUNT SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A GENERAL IDEA OF THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY
A SECOND ENIGMA UPON RE-EMBARKING THE BEWILDERED EXPLORERS BEGAN TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION WHETHER IT WOULD NOT NOW BE DESIRABLE TO MAKE THEIR WAY BACK TO GOURBI ISLAND WHICH WAS APPARENTLY THE ONLY SPOT IN THEIR NEW WORLD FROM WHICH THEY COULD HOPE TO DERIVE THEIR FUTURE SUSTENANCE
ITS EQUATORIAL BANDS
FAR TOO INTENSE WAS THE COLD TO ALLOW ANYONE TO REMAIN AT THE OPENING AND THE MOISTURE ON THE WALLS SOON RESOLVED ITSELF INTO ICICLES
FOR THROUGHOUT THOSE CALM CLEAR GALLIAN NIGHTS WHEN THE BOOK OF THE FIRMAMENT LAY OPEN BEFORE HIM HE COULD REVEL IN A SPECTACLE WHICH NO PREVIOUS ASTRONOMER HAD EVER BEEN PERMITTED TO ENJOY
FOR ISAAC HAKKABUT ALONE THERE WAS NO FEELING OF REGRET
BY OPENING FRESH VENTS IN THE SOLID ROCK WHICH BY THE ACTION OF THE HEAT WAS HERE CAPABLE OF FISSURE THE STREAM OF BURNING LAVA WAS DIVERTED INTO SEVERAL NEW CHANNELS WHERE IT COULD BE AVAILABLE FOR DAILY USE
THOROUGHLY APPRECIATING HIS SERVANT'S GOOD QUALITIES CAPTAIN SERVADAC ENDURED WITH IMPERTURBABLE GOOD HUMOR THOSE IDIOSYNCRASIES WHICH IN A LESS FAITHFUL FOLLOWER WOULD HAVE BEEN INTOLERABLE AND FROM TIME TO TIME HE WOULD DROP A WORD OF SYMPATHY THAT SERVED TO DEEPEN HIS SUBORDINATE'S DEVOTION
THERE IS A HABITATION ON THE PLACE
PERCHANCE SOME UNHEARD-OF PHENOMENON HAD MODIFIED THE ROTARY MOTION OF THE GLOBE
ACCORDINGLY THE GREATER PORTION OF THE PARTY ESCORTED BY BEN ZOOF MADE THEIR WAY INTO ONE OF THE ADJACENT GALLERIES THAT LED TO THE SHORE
YOU ARE FORGETTING THAT IF I PLEASE I CAN CONFISCATE ALL YOUR CARGO FOR THE COMMON USE
HE IS ALIVE HE SAID AND DRAWING A SMALL FLASK FROM HIS POCKET HE POURED A FEW DROPS OF BRANDY BETWEEN THE LIPS OF THE SENSELESS MAN
NEVERTHELESS EXCEPT THE NECESSITY BECAME FAR MORE URGENT THAN IT HAD HITHERTO PROVED THEY RESOLVED TO ENDEAVOR TO REMAIN IN THEIR PRESENT QUARTERS
BUT WHATEVER HE WAS HIS LIFE IF POSSIBLE MUST BE PRESERVED
BEFORE HOWEVER THEY COMMENCED THEIR DESCENT THEY RESOLVED TO MAKE A CLOSER EXAMINATION OF THE CRATER
THE LIEUTENANT FELT THE DIFFICULTY AND OWNED HIMSELF UNPREPARED TO GIVE AT ONCE AN ADEQUATE SOLUTION
AND WHAT WAS THE TRUE MEASUREMENT OF THE NEW LITTLE WORLD
NOTHING SO SAFE AS GOLD WELL THEN SAID THE CAPTAIN NOT WANTING TO LOSE HIS TEMPER YOU SHALL HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY
A FINAL CONSULTATION WAS HELD ABOUT THE HANSA
ACCORDINGLY THEY ARE FIT TO BE UTILIZED FOR MY PURPOSE OF OBTAINING THE PRECISE LENGTH OF A TERRESTRIAL METER BEN ZOOF LOOKED ON IN PERPLEXITY REGARDING THE LECTURER WITH MUCH THE SAME CURIOSITY AS HE WOULD HAVE WATCHED THE PERFORMANCES OF A TRAVELING MOUNTEBANK AT A FAIR IN MONTMARTRE
AND THE PAPERS WHICH CONSISTED FOR THE MOST PART OF DETACHED SCRAPS PRESENTED A PERFECT WILDERNESS OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES CONIC SECTIONS OF EVERY VARIETY BEING REPEATED IN COUNTLESS PROFUSION
AND IT WAS MUTUALLY AGREED THAT THE OCCASION MUST BE HONORED BY A BUMPER OF PORT AND BY A ROYAL SALUTE
SERVADAC WITH THE COUNT AND LIEUTENANT DID NOT FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY
EUROPE
IT WAS A MATTER OF EXTREME SURPRISE TO FIND NO SYMPTOM OF THE LEAST EXCITEMENT ANYWHERE AS THEY WENT ALONG
2
SUCH WAS BEN ZOOF'S VERSION OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED AS HE HAD GATHERED IT FROM THE NEW-COMERS
ORDINARILY COMETS ARE CONSPICUOUS AT THEIR PERIHELIA AS BEING THEIR SHORTEST DISTANCES FROM THE SUN WHICH IS THE FOCUS OF THEIR ORBIT AND INASMUCH AS A PARABOLA IS BUT AN ELLIPSE WITH ITS AXIS INDEFINITELY PRODUCED FOR SOME SHORT PORTION OF ITS PATHWAY THE ORBIT MAY BE INDIFFERENTLY CONSIDERED EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER
ON ITS DISC THE CLOUDS FORMED FROM ITS ATMOSPHERIC VAPOR WERE PLAINLY PERCEPTIBLE AS ALSO WERE THE SEVEN SPOTS WHICH ACCORDING TO BIANCHINI ARE A CHAIN OF SEAS
IT INCREASED IN CLEARNESS IN THE GATHERING SHADES OF EVENING
PERHAPS HE ADDED WITH A SMILE EVEN MONTMARTRE MIGHT NOT HAVE SURVIVED THE CALAMITY SIR SHOUTED BEN ZOOF QUITE UNABLE TO BEAR THE UNPROVOKED ATTACK
THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF SMOKE THE DOBRYNA REPEATED THE CAPTAIN POSITIVELY
MOST LIKELY REPLIED PROCOPE
ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THE 27TH BEN ZOOF WALKED DELIBERATELY INTO HIS MASTER'S APARTMENT AND IN REPLY TO A QUESTION AS TO WHAT HE WANTED ANNOUNCED WITH THE UTMOST COMPOSURE THAT A SHIP WAS IN SIGHT
THEY KNEW THAT FRENCH COINAGE IS ALL DECIMAL THE FRANC BEING THE STANDARD OF WHICH THE OTHER COINS WHETHER GOLD SILVER OR COPPER ARE MULTIPLES OR MEASURES
BUT THIS STATE OF THINGS WAS BEFORE LONG TO COME TO AN END
HE CLEARED THE LAST RIDGE OF ROCKS AT A SINGLE BOUND AND THEN SUDDENLY HALTED
THE LIEUTENANT URGED THAT HE WAS THE MOST EXPERIENCED SEAMAN AND AS SUCH WAS BEST QUALIFIED TO TAKE COMMAND OF THE SLEDGE AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE SAILS
NO TIME TO LOSE IT WAS HALF-PAST SEVEN IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY SET THEIR FOOT UPON THIS UNTRIED LAND
BUT THE RUGGED OUTLINE OF THE CLIFF WAS THE SAME AS HERETOFORE AND THE ASPECT OF THE ENTIRE SCENE APPEARED UNALTERED
THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER
I AM NEARLY RUINED ALREADY CEASE YOUR WRETCHED WHINING CRIED SERVADAC
FROM THE PRIMA FACIE APPEARANCE OF HIS PAPERS THEN IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT THE ASTRONOMER DURING HIS SOJOURN AT FORMENTERA HAD BEEN DEVOTING HIMSELF TO THE STUDY OF COMETARY ORBITS
THE WAVES DASHED VIOLENTLY AGAINST ITS BASE
THE COLONEL AND THE MAJOR STARED AT EACH OTHER IN BLANK ASTONISHMENT
MEANTIME WITH THE AGILITY OF A MONKEY BEN ZOOF HAD CLAMBERED TO THE TOP OF A EUCALYPTUS AND FROM HIS LOFTY PERCH WAS SURVEYING THE COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH AS WELL AS TOWARDS BOTH TENES AND MOSTAGANEM
THE SMILE OF DISDAIN AGAIN CROSSED THE COLONEL'S FACE
AND THE RINGING CHEERS THAT FOLLOWED THE GREAT TOAST OF THE DAY--"A HAPPY RETURN TO OUR MOTHER EARTH MUST FAIRLY HAVE STARTLED THE PROFESSOR IN THE SILENCE OF HIS OBSERVATORY
AND WHAT ARE WE TO DO THEN ASKED BEN ZOOF
ITS MARABOUTS OR TEMPLE-TOMBS SHADED BY MAGNIFICENT PALMS THAT FRINGED THE GULF WHICH BY REASON OF ITS NARROW MOUTH HAD THE SEMBLANCE OF A LAKE ALL HAD DISAPPEARED GIVING PLACE TO A VAST WASTE OF SEA THE TRANSPARENT WAVES OF WHICH AS STILL DEMONSTRATED BY THE SOUNDING-LINE HAD EVER THE SAME UNIFORM AND ARID BOTTOM
A POET HE HAD LEFT THE EARTH AND A POET HE MUST RETURN
SERVADAC WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NOTHING TANGIBLE HAD HITHERTO PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIS MIND
NEVER HAD SUCH A PITIABLE SERIES OF LOSSES BEFALLEN AN UNFORTUNATE MAN
FOR THE FIRST DAY EVERYTHING WENT ON PROSPEROUSLY ENOUGH
THE SPANIARDS WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE SLIGHTEST HESITATION IN SUMMARILY TAKING POSSESSION OF HER BUT THEIR UTTER IGNORANCE OF SEAMANSHIP MADE THEM RELUCTANTLY COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE MORE PRUDENT POLICY WAS TO MAKE TERMS WITH THE OWNER
BUT AWAY IN THE NORTHWEST IN OPPOSITION TO THE SUN FLOATED A NEW SPHERE SO SMALL THAT IT COULD NOT BE AN ASTEROID BUT LIKE A DIM METEOR
PAPER HAS NO CURRENCY IN GALLIA ABOUT AS MUCH AS SILVER COOLLY RETORTED THE COUNT
HER SPEED OF COURSE WE KNOW BY KEPLER'S LAWS WOULD VARY ACCORDING TO HER DISTANCE FROM THE SUN AND IF SHE WERE--AS I CONJECTURE FROM THE TEMPERATURE AT THAT DATE--ON THE 15TH OF JANUARY AT HER PERIHELION SHE WOULD BE TRAVELING TWICE AS FAST AS THE EARTH WHICH MOVES AT THE RATE OF BETWEEN 50,000 AND 60,000 MILES AN HOUR YOU THINK THEN SAID SERVADAC WITH A SMILE YOU HAVE DETERMINED THE PERIHELION OF OUR ORBIT
WHEN IN A FEW MOMENTS HE BEGAN TO SPEAK SERVADAC SMILED INTELLIGENTLY ANTICIPATING THE ANSWER HE WAS ABOUT TO HEAR
A THIN CURL OF BLUE SMOKE ISSUED FROM THE COPPER FUNNEL THAT PROJECTED ABOVE THE MASS OF SNOW WHICH HAD ACCUMULATED UPON THE DECK OF THE HANSA
THE INTERMEDIATE ONE WHICH IS BRIGHTER THAN THE PLANET ITSELF BEING 17,605 MILES BROAD
WE HAVE PLENTY OF GOLD FOR THE PRESENT
I FORGET MY ASTRONOMY LIEUTENANT SAID SERVADAC
NOW OLD NICODEMUS LISTEN TO ME INTERPOSED BEN ZOOF
NOT EVEN PABLO AND NINA WERE EXEMPTED FROM THE GENERAL RULE
IT IS TRUE THAT INDENTATIONS WERE PERCEPTIBLE IN THE FERTILE PLAIN AND THE SURFACE OF THE SEA WAS RUFFLED WITH AN AGITATION THAT WAS QUITE UNUSUAL
MEANWHILE THE QUESTION BEYOND ALL OTHERS IMPORTANT WAS EVER RECURRING TO THE MINDS OF SERVADAC AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS
THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE COMET AND JUPITER WAS BY THE 1ST OF OCTOBER REDUCED TO 43,000,000 MILES
IN AN INSTANT SERVADAC MOUNTED THE SIDE-WORK LAID HIMSELF DOWN IN THE GAP AND THUS FILLING UP THE BREACH BY HIS OWN BODY SHOUTED MARCH ON AND THROUGH A STORM OF SHOT NOT ONE OF WHICH TOUCHED THE PROSTRATE OFFICER THE TROOP PASSED IN SAFETY
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE POINTED OUT THAT THESE CURVES EVIDENTLY HAD REFERENCE TO THE ORBITS OF COMETS WHICH ARE VARIOUSLY PARABOLIC HYPERBOLIC OR ELLIPTIC
WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE 8TH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVADAC
WHAT CAN HAVE BECOME OF ALL MY FRIENDS AND FELLOW-OFFICERS BEN ZOOF WAS SILENT
WE WILL PAY HIM BY BILLS OF ACCEPTANCE ON SOME OF HIS OLD FRIENDS IN THE OLD WORLD BUT WHY SHOULD HE WANT ANY PAYMENT INQUIRED THE LIEUTENANT
SERVADAC MOREOVER DID NOT FAIL TO OBSERVE THAT FOR THE SEASON THE TEMPERATURE WAS UNUSUALLY HIGH
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY GLAD TO DO ANOTHER STROKE OR TWO OF BUSINESS UPON TERMS AS ADVANTAGEOUS AS THE TRANSACTION HE HAD JUST CONCLUDED
IT WAS TO BE LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY THE WHOLE OF THE TWENTY-THREE RESIDENTS IN THE VOLCANO AND IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE MEANS OF FLOATING ALOFT LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE TIME FOR SELECTING A PROPER PLACE FOR DESCENT THE LIEUTENANT WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE IT CARRY ENOUGH HAY OR STRAW TO MAINTAIN COMBUSTION FOR A WHILE AND KEEP UP THE NECESSARY SUPPLY OF HEATED AIR
BEFORE THEY HAD REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF 600 FEET THEY NOTICED A SENSIBLE DIMINUTION OF THE TEMPERATURE
WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR ITS BEING AS LIGHT AS THIS NOTHING DAUNTED HOWEVER HE HURLED THE STONE INTO THE AIR
THE OLD GLOBE IS FAR FAR AWAY
AT LENGTH EMBOLDENED BY HUNGER SEVERAL HUNDRED BIRDS VENTURED THROUGH THE TUNNEL AND TOOK UP THEIR QUARTERS ACTUALLY IN NINA'S HIVE
OF THE ANXIETY ENDURED DURING THE LAST TWO MONTHS ISAAC HAKKABUT HAD KNOWN NOTHING
I SAID CORFU REPLIED SERVADAC WITH A SORT OF MALICIOUS TRIUMPH
THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE EXPEDITION WERE BRIEF AND SIMPLE
ON THE 20TH THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO BODIES HAD AGAIN SENSIBLY DIMINISHED
AND FIRST OF ALL LET US SETTLE OUR LITTLE SCORE WITH COUNT TIMASCHEFF BEYOND THE DITCH LAY A SMALL PIECE OF MEADOW LAND ABOUT AN ACRE IN EXTENT
WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES OF A SECOND COLLISION THEY SCARCELY VENTURED TO THINK
MEANS FOR HOLLOWING IT FAILED THEM UTTERLY
NEW YORK
HE ACCORDINGLY BEGAN TO MAKE THREATENING GESTURES WHEN TO THE UNMITIGATED ASTONISHMENT OF HIMSELF AND THE CAPTAIN THE ANIMAL DARTED FORWARD AND IN ONE SINGLE BOUND GAINED THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCK
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF MANY ARCTIC EXPLORERS HAD THE PRECAUTION TO HAVE THE ICE BEVELED AWAY FROM THE KEELS SO THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO RISK OF THE SHIPS SIDES BEING CRUSHED BY THE INCREASING PRESSURE
THEN WE HAVE ALREADY PASSED THE ZONE OF THE TELESCOPIC PLANETS HAVE WE NOT ASKED THE COUNT
THE WING BORE THE FAINT IMPRESS OF A POSTAGE-STAMP AND THE ONE WORD
THE UTTER STILLNESS OF THE AIR AT THE TIME WHEN THE FINAL CONGELATION OF THE WATERS HAD TAKEN PLACE HAD RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF A SURFACE THAT FOR SMOOTHNESS WOULD RIVAL A SKATING-RINK
LOOK
JUPITER IS OUR SOLE HINDRANCE
NO LAND WAS IN SIGHT
REPUDIATING AS HE DID UTTERLY THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A FRAGMENT HAD BECOME DETACHED FROM THE EARTH HE SCANNED THE HORIZON FOR HOURS TOGETHER WITH AN OLD TELESCOPE THE CASE OF WHICH HAD BEEN PATCHED UP TILL IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY STOVE-PIPE HOPING TO DESCRY THE PASSING TRADER WITH WHICH HE MIGHT EFFECT SOME BARTERING UPON ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS
TWENTY MINUTES SUFFICED TO CARRY THEM OVER THE FOUR OR FIVE MILES THAT INTERVENED BETWEEN THE GOURBI AND THE MOUTH OF THE SHELIF
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WHO HAD HITHERTO NOT SPOKEN NOW BROKE HIS SILENCE BY SAYING I BEG GENTLEMEN TO SUBMIT MY OPINION THAT THIS DOCUMENT GOES VERY FAR TO CONFIRM MY HYPOTHESIS THAT A FRAGMENT OF THE EARTH HAS BEEN PRECIPITATED INTO SPACE CAPTAIN SERVADAC HESITATED AND THEN REPLIED EVEN IF IT DOES I DO NOT SEE HOW IT ACCOUNTS IN THE LEAST FOR THE GEOLOGICAL CHARACTER OF THE NEW ASTEROID BUT WILL YOU ALLOW ME FOR ONE MINUTE TO TAKE MY SUPPOSITION FOR GRANTED SAID PROCOPE
IF I WISH IT EXCLAIMED ROSETTE
HI
SERVADAC THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT ALL KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT IT WAS THE WANT OF AIR AND EXERCISE THAT WAS THE CAUSE OF MUCH OF THIS MENTAL DEPRESSION
I SAID NERINA OH NERINA ANSWERED SERVADAC
HAD HE GAINED THIS ARDUOUS HEIGHT ONLY TO BEHOLD THE ROCKS CARPETED WITH ICE AND SNOW AND REACHING INTERMINABLY TO THE FAR-OFF HORIZON
WELL WRAPPED UP THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO PREVENT THEM MAKING OCCASIONAL EXCURSIONS BOTH TO THE HIVE AND TO THE SEA-SHORE
THE WEATHER WHICH ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HAD BEEN VERY FOGGY HAD ENTIRELY CHANGED
THE ORDERLY WAS NOW SOME YARDS AHEAD OF HIS MASTER AND HAD REACHED A DITCH FULL OF WATER AND ABOUT TEN FEET WIDE
AT RARE INTERVALS THERE WERE SOME NARROW FISSURES BUT NOT A CREEK AVAILABLE FOR A SHIP TO ENTER TO REPLENISH ITS SUPPLY OF WATER
OUR COUNTRY WAS SURE TO SEND TO OUR RELIEF
TRULY DARING WAS THE PLAN OF WHICH LIEUTENANT PROCOPE HAD THUS BECOME THE ORIGINATOR
A CARRIER-PIGEON
CHEMIN PARCOURU DE FEV
IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT IT SHOULD BE SO TOTALLY SUBMERGED
GALLIA OF COURSE IS ON HER WAY TO THE EARTH
AND FROM THAT MOMENT HECTOR SERVADAC AND MONTMARTRE HELD EQUAL PLACES IN HIS AFFECTION
MY LORD GOVERNOR AS BEN ZOOF UNTIL HE WAS PEREMPTORILY FORBIDDEN DELIGHTED TO CALL SERVADAC HAD A WHOLESOME DREAD OF IDLENESS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES AND INSISTED UPON EACH MEMBER OF THE PARTY UNDERTAKING SOME SPECIAL DUTY TO FULFILL
I LIKE YOU
FIVE DAYS OR WHAT ACCORDING TO THE ESTABLISHED ORDER OF THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO DAYS AND A HALF HAD BEEN OCCUPIED IN TRACING THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR NEW DOMAIN
NAY THEY EVEN OFFERED TO GO INSTEAD
AS HE WENT ALONG CAPTAIN SERVADAC PONDERED DEEPLY
THE CAPTAIN MUST BE THE LAST TO LEAVE THE SHIP A MOMENT'S HESITATION AND THE ORDERLY CLAMBERED OVER THE SIDE OF THE CAR
THE INDEX REGISTERED ONLY 133 GRAMMES
INDEED IT IS TOO LITTLE YOUR EXCELLENCY
NEVERTHELESS HE DECLINED TO RENOUNCE HIS THEORY
A BOLD PROPOSITION ON HIS RETURN SERVADAC COMMUNICATED TO THE COUNT THE RESULT OF HIS EXPEDITION AND THOUGH PERFECTLY SILENT ON THE SUBJECT OF HIS PERSONAL PROJECT DID NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT THE SPANIARDS WITHOUT THE SMALLEST RIGHT HAD SOLD CEUTA TO THE ENGLISH
WELL BEN ZOOF ASKED THE CAPTAIN WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW OH YOUR EXCELLENCY EJACULATED THE ORDERLY LOOK THERE
COUNT MAY I ASK YOU CONTINUED SERVADAC TO BE SECURITY TO THE JEW FOR THIS LOAN TO THE PROFESSOR LOAN CRIED THE JEW DO YOU MEAN ONLY A LOAN SILENCE AGAIN SHOUTED THE CAPTAIN
BUT NO REPRESENTATIONS ON THEIR PART WERE OF ANY AVAIL
IT WAS FURTHER OBSERVED THAT JUPITER ITSELF WAS ALMOST VOID OF SCINTILLATION
WE MUST TRUST THAT IT HAS LIMITED ITS MISCHIEF TO SOME SMALL PORTION OF THE ALGERIAN COAST AND THAT OUR FRIENDS ARE ALL ALIVE AND WELL
AND THE PLAN THEY PROPOSED WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO DISCOVER HOW MUCH OF THE AFRICAN COAST STILL REMAINED AND TO CARRY ON THE TIDINGS OF THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES TO ALGIERS
YOUR GOLD WILL HAVE NO VALUE WHEN YOU GO BACK TO THE WORLD WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED HAKKABUT STARTLED
IT WAS TWO HOURS AFTER THE CATASTROPHE THAT CAPTAIN SERVADAC REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
SERVADAC AND THE COUNT GRASPED EACH OTHER'S HANDS FOR A LONG FAREWELL
SUCH WERE THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS OF NINA'S HIVE THE REFUGE WHERE THE LITTLE COLONY WERE FULL OF HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BRAVE THE RIGORS OF THE STERN WINTER-TIME THAT LAY BEFORE THEM--A WINTER-TIME DURING WHICH GALLIA MIGHT POSSIBLY BE PROJECTED EVEN TO THE ORBIT OF JUPITER WHERE THE TEMPERATURE WOULD NOT EXCEED ONE TWENTY-FIFTH OF THE NORMAL WINTER TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH
AFTER WANDERING ABOUT AS SHE WOULD FOR A WHILE IN THE SOLAR REGIONS I DO NOT SEE WHY SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE ATTACHED HERSELF TO US THE LIEUTENANT REPEATED HIS CONVICTION THAT IT WAS NOT LIKELY
OH MY LORD LET ME SAY BEGAN ISAAC AGAIN
ON HIS WAY TO THE GOURBI HIS MENTAL OCCUPATION WAS A VERY LABORIOUS EFFORT TO PUT TOGETHER WHAT HE WAS PLEASED TO CALL A RONDO UPON A MODEL OF VERSIFICATION ALL BUT OBSOLETE
I REPLIED THE QUAVERING VOICE
IT WAS ON THE 25TH OF FEBRUARY THAT THE YACHT LEFT THE LITTLE CREEK IN WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN REFUGE AND SETTING OFF AT FULL STEAM EASTWARDS SHE CONTINUED HER WAY ALONG THE NORTHERN SHORE
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS HENCE AND THE BALLOON WITH ITS LARGE LIVING FREIGHT WOULD BE HIGH IN THE AIR
I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED UNTIL BY ACTUAL MEASUREMENT I HAVE DETERMINED ITS MASS ITS DENSITY AND THE FORCE OF GRAVITY AT ITS SURFACE A LABORIOUS PROBLEM REMARKED COUNT TIMASCHEFF
THE WIND BLEW FROM THE WEST AND CONSEQUENTLY THE WORKING OF THE TARTAN WAS EASY ENOUGH
THE PROBABILITY THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF WAS THAT THE SCHOONER'S FUEL WAS EXHAUSTED
BUT THAT THEY ALL REVOLVE IN CONSIDERABLY LESS TIME
AND HE CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF AND GRINNED MALICIOUSLY
THE GLOWING EXPANSE OF THE EARTH'S DISC SEEMED LIKE A VAST FUNNEL YAWNING TO RECEIVE THE COMET AND ITS ATMOSPHERE BALLOON AND ALL INTO ITS OPEN MOUTH
THEIR MUSCULAR STRENGTH SEEMED FIVE TIMES AS GREAT AS HITHERTO
ON THEY WENT UP THE STEEP ACCLIVITY SCRAMBLING OVER ITS RUGGED PROJECTIONS SCALING THE IRREGULARITIES OF ITS GIGANTIC STRATA BOUNDING FROM POINT TO POINT WITH THE AGILITY OF CHAMOIS BUT NEVER ALIGHTING ON ANYTHING EXCEPT ON THE ACCUMULATION OF THE SAME HEXAGONAL PRISMS WITH WHICH THEY HAD NOW BECOME SO FAMILIAR
NEPTUNE SITUATED 2,746,271,000 MILES FROM THE SUN ISSUED FROM THE SOLAR NEBULOSITY THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF CENTURIES BACK
MAY I BE ALLOWED TO ASK CAPTAIN SERVADAC TO WHAT I AM INDEBTED FOR THE HONOR OF THIS VISIT ASKED MAJOR OLIPHANT PRESENTLY
TO GET ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLANET FROM ROSETTE APPEARED QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
WE MUST HAVE PASSED CLOSE TO FORMENTERA HE SAID WHEN WE EXPLORED THE SITE OF THE BALEARIC ISLES
MERCIFUL HEAVENS AGAIN HOWLED THE JEW IT IS SHEER RUIN
IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE SPACE AT THEIR COMMAND SHOULD BE PROPERLY UTILIZED AND YET THAT THE SEVERAL PORTIONS OF THE STORE SHOULD ALL BE READILY ACCESSIBLE
WE WILL HAVE A BALL THIS TIME
AND WITH ANOTHER LOW BOW THEY PARTED
FROM WHOM ELSE COULD THEY COME FROM NO ONE BUT YOURSELF CERTAINLY REJOINED THE COUNT WITH GRAVE POLITENESS
JOY
WATER HE FELT CERTAIN COULD BE OBTAINED IN ABUNDANCE FROM THE NUMEROUS AFFLUENTS OF THE SHELIF WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY HAD NOW BECOME TRIBUTARIES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN STILL MEANDERED THROUGH THE PLAIN
NO SHUFFLINGS
FRANCE AT LEAST IS SAFE A SCENE APPEARED INEVITABLE AND COUNT TIMASCHEFF'S EFFORTS TO CONCILIATE THE EXCITED PARTIES WERE OF SMALL AVAIL
HOWEVER SKILLFULLY THE OPERATION MIGHT BE CARRIED ON IT MUST NECESSARILY OCCUPY SEVERAL DAYS AND DURING THAT TIME THE SUFFERINGS FROM COLD MUST BE VERY SEVERE
WE HAVE NOT BEEN INTRODUCED THEN WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND TOWARDS HIS COMPANION WHO MEANWHILE HAD EXHIBITED A RESERVE HARDLY LESS THAN THAT OF THE BRITISH OFFICERS HE SAID
THIRTEEN DAYS THEN--TWENTY-SIX OF THE ORIGINAL GALLIAN DAYS FIFTY-TWO OF THE PRESENT--WAS ALL THE TIME FOR PREPARATION THAT NOW REMAINED
THEY ARE BOTH LIGHT AND STRONG REJOINED THE LIEUTENANT
NOT ONLY WAS THAT PART OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SYSTEMATICALLY FREQUENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT STEAMERS THAT WATCHED THE COAST BUT VESSELS OF ALL NATIONS WERE CONSTANTLY CRUISING OFF THE SHORE
THE MOST TERRIBLE STORMS LIKE THE MOST VIOLENT FITS OF PASSION ARE NOT LASTING
NO ONE WAS QUITE EXEMPT FROM THE FEVERISH EXCITEMENT WHICH PREVAILED DURING THE LAST DAYS OF DECEMBER
YES CONTINUED THE PROFESSOR GALLIA IS A PERIODIC COMET AND ALLOWING FOR THE PERTURBATIONS TO WHICH IT IS LIABLE FROM THE ATTRACTION OF MARS AND JUPITER AND SATURN IT WILL RETURN TO THE EARTH AGAIN IN TWO YEARS PRECISELY YOU MEAN THAT IN TWO YEARS AFTER THE FIRST SHOCK GALLIA WILL MEET THE EARTH AT THE SAME POINT AS THEY MET BEFORE SAID LIEUTENANT PROCOPE
HOW CAN THE SUN BE IN THE ZENITH IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY IN LAT
WHEREUPON THE JEW FINDING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS IN EARNEST AND WOULD NOT HESITATE TO CARRY THE THREAT INTO EFFECT WAS FAIN TO HOLD HIS TONGUE AND SLUNK BACK INTO HIS DIM HOLE
ENORMOUS WAVES CAUGHT THE SCHOONER AND CARRIED HER UP TO THEIR CRESTS WHENCE AGAIN SHE WAS PLUNGED DEEP INTO THE ABYSSES THAT THEY LEFT
YOU ARE SOLVENT--I MEAN HONORABLE AND HIS LORDSHIP THE COUNT IS HONORABLE
I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED SIR HE BEGAN IN A TONE EVIDENCING NO LITTLE RESENTMENT
AND HE RAISED HIS FINGER AS IF IN WARNING
IT WAS ON ALL HANDS ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE ADVISABLE TO LET HIM GO ON ENTIRELY IN HIS OWN WAY
BUT WHAT A COMFORT LITTLE NINA HAS BEEN TO US ALL YES INDEED REPLIED SERVADAC
AM I NOT RIGHT
DON'T MOVE AN INCH SHOUTED SERVADAC
FOR A MOMENT BEN ZOOF STOOD WITH CLENCHED TEETH AND CONTRACTED MUSCLES
THEY ENTERED AND GROPED THEIR WAY CAUTIOUSLY ALONG THE SIDES
IN THE HOLD WERE SUGAR-LOAVES BY HUNDREDS CHESTS OF TEA BAGS OF COFFEE HOGSHEADS OF TOBACCO PIPES OF WINE CASKS OF BRANDY BARRELS OF DRIED HERRINGS BALES OF COTTON CLOTHING OF EVERY KIND SHOES OF ALL SIZES CAPS OF VARIOUS SHAPE TOOLS HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS CHINA AND EARTHENWARE REAMS OF PAPER BOTTLES OF INK BOXES OF LUCIFER MATCHES BLOCKS OF SALT BAGS OF PEPPER AND SPICES A STOCK OF HUGE DUTCH CHEESES AND A COLLECTION OF ALMANACS AND MISCELLANEOUS LITERATURE
BUT MALTA TOO WAS GONE
IT WAS ENOUGH WITHOUT A WORD TO INDICATE THE COURSE WHICH EVENTS HAD TAKEN
A FEW HOURS LATER THE MAN ON WATCH ANNOUNCED THAT GOURBI ISLAND WAS IN SIGHT
EVERYTHING WAS JUST AS THEY HAD LEFT IT AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT NO ONE HAD VISITED THE PLACE DURING THEIR ABSENCE
AND TOSSED BY THE TREMENDOUS WAVES THE SCHOONER WAS ON THE VERY POINT OF BEING HURLED UPON THE CLIFF WHEN A RINGING SHOUT WAS HEARD
WE HAVE HARDLY STARTED YET SEEING THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS INCLINED TO GET ANGRY CAPTAIN SERVADAC ADROITLY GAVE A NEW TURN TO THE CONVERSATION BY ASKING HIM WHETHER HE WOULD GRATIFY THEM BY RELATING HIS OWN RECENT EXPERIENCES
TELL ME NINA WHAT IS THIS HE ASKED AS SOON AS THE TUMULT HAD SUBSIDED
THE CIRCUIT OF THE ISLAND HAD BEEN NOW COMPLETED AND THE EXPLORERS AFTER A PERIOD OF SIXTY HOURS FOUND THEMSELVES ONCE MORE BESIDE THE RUINS OF THEIR GOURBI
DAY AND NIGHT WITH THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE INTERVALS OF REST DESPITE WIND RAIN AND STORM HE MOUNTED GUARD UPON THE CLIFF--BUT ALL IN VAIN
THE TEMPERATURE WAS NOW RARELY BELOW 12 DEGREES BELOW ZERO BUT THAT WAS FAR TOO COLD TO PERMIT THE SLIGHTEST SYMPTOMS OF A THAW
WHETHER IT WAS A PASSAGE OR NO IT MATTERED LITTLE
NOW HE THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE A CHANCE OF SOLVING HIS PERPLEXITY
TELL US YOUR NAME LITTLE ONE NINA WAS THE CHILD'S REPLY
A FLAG AT HER MAST-HEAD FLUTTERED IN THE BREEZE AND TOWARDS THIS THE TWO OFFICERS WITH THE KEENEST ATTENTION RESPECTIVELY ADJUSTED THEIR FOCUS
IT WAS OF COURSE IMPOSSIBLE TO CONJECTURE HOW FAR THIS BARRIER EXTENDED
SATURN WAS SUPERB IN ITS LUSTER AND URANUS WHICH HITHERTO HAD BEEN IMPERCEPTIBLE WITHOUT A TELESCOPE WAS POINTED OUT BY LIEUTENANT PROCOPE PLAINLY VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE
THE LIEUTENANT WAS WELL INFORMED IN MANY MATTERS OUTSIDE THE PALE OF HIS PROFESSION AND HIS ATTAINMENTS WERE ALIKE CREDITABLE TO HIMSELF AND TO THE LIBERAL FRIEND WHO HAD GIVEN HIM HIS EDUCATION
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YONDER LITTLE SPECK OF LIGHT CONTAINS MY MOUNTAIN OF MONTMARTRE SAID BEN ZOOF ONE NIGHT AFTER HE HAD BEEN GAZING LONG AND STEADILY AT THE FAR-OFF WORLD
C
THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THROUGHOUT THE WINTER THE SOIL WOULD REMAIN UNPRODUCTIVE AND NO FRESH FODDER FOR DOMESTIC ANIMALS COULD THEN BE OBTAINED
I SHOULD MUCH RATHER LAY TO AND WAIT TILL DAYLIGHT
YOU WOULD NOT REFUSE ANYBODY ELSE THAT'S JUST THE VERY POINT OLD SAMUEL
THE POPULATION PERFORMED THEIR DAILY AVOCATIONS WITH SYSTEMATIC ROUTINE
BUT AS THIS SUSTENANCE WOULD BE OBTAINED AT THE EXPENSE AND PROBABLY TO THE SERIOUS DETRIMENT OF THE HUMAN POPULATION IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT EVERY POSSIBLE RESISTANCE SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEVASTATION THAT WAS THREATENED
OR WOULD IT HOLD THE COURSE THAT THE ASTRONOMER HAD PREDICTED
IGNORING THIS EBULLITION OF THE CAPTAIN'S SPLEEN THE COUNT WENT ON TO SAY
NOT YET HAVE WE REACHED THE POLE OF OUR NEW WORLD
HIS PULSE BEAT FAST AS HE RECALLED THE FRIENDS AND COMRADES WITH WHOM HE HAD SPENT THE LAST FEW YEARS IN THAT VANISHED CITY
BUT THE GOURBI LIKE A HOUSE OF CARDS DESTROYED BY AN INFANT'S BREATH HAD COMPLETELY SUBSIDED AND ITS TWO INMATES LAY MOTIONLESS BURIED UNDER THE SUNKEN THATCH
IN THAT LATITUDE THE DEGREE OF LONGITUDE REPRESENTS EIGHT AND FORTY MILES
THE INTELLIGENCE WAS IMMEDIATELY IMPARTED TO COUNT TIMASCHEFF AND THE LIEUTENANT
A THAW HAD NOW FAIRLY SET IN
AH INDEED REPLIED THE MAJOR AS THOUGH HE FELT HIMSELF QUITE INDEPENDENT OF ALL SERVICES FROM EXTERIOR SOURCES
THEY HAVE BEEN ENLISTED INTO THE SERVICE OF SCIENCE SAID PROCOPE
PERHAPS I HAD BETTER GO WITH YOU MYSELF
AS THE OBSERVER HOWEVER INCREASES HIS LATITUDE EITHER NORTH OR SOUTH THE BAND WILL GRADUALLY WIDEN OUT INTO THREE DETACHED AND CONCENTRIC RINGS OF WHICH THE INNERMOST DARK THOUGH TRANSPARENT IS 9,625 MILES IN BREADTH
DO YOU NOT RECKON ME PSHAW
IMPOSSIBLE SAID LIEUTENANT PROCOPE
NO INDEED
THE HEAT WAS BECOMING INSUFFERABLE SURPASSING THE HEAT OF SENEGAL AND OTHER EQUATORIAL REGIONS
WERE THE FIGURES IN THE MYSTERIOUS DOCUMENTS CORRECT
BUT YOU ALWAYS WERE A DISAPPOINTING PUPIL THE CAPTAIN COULD NOT HELP HIMSELF
HE IS FAST ASLEEP ANSWERED BEN ZOOF
BEN ZOOF ADDED AND AS TO THE DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN THE JEW AND HIS PASSENGERS I TOLD HIM THAT THE GOVERNOR GENERAL WAS ABSENT ON A TOUR OF INSPECTION AND THAT HE WOULD SEE EVERYTHING EQUITABLY SETTLED SMILING AT HIS ORDERLY'S TACTICS SERVADAC TURNED TO HAKKABUT AND TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD TAKE CARE THAT HIS CLAIMS SHOULD BE DULY INVESTIGATED AND ALL PROPER DEMANDS SHOULD BE PAID
AND WHEN UPON THE 14TH THE SOUNDING-LINE WAS DROPPED UPON ITS SITE IT WAS ONLY WITH THE SAME RESULT SO OFTENTIMES OBTAINED BEFORE
HERE THEY FOUND THE PROFESSOR WHO STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN COLD HAD BEEN FAIN TO MAKE A PRECIPITATE RETREAT FROM HIS OBSERVATORY
MEANWHILE ALL THE SILVER AND GOLD OF THE COLONY WAS GRADUALLY FINDING ITS WAY TO A DOUBLE-LOCKED DRAWER OF WHICH THE JEW MOST CAREFULLY GUARDED THE KEY
I WILL TELL YOU WHY IT SEEMS SO
AND CERTAIN IT WAS THAT NO TIME MUST BE LOST IN PENETRATING BELOW THE HEART OF THE VOLCANO
MOREOVER AS THE BODIES WERE MOVING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE SHOCK COULD HARDLY FAIL TO BE VIOLENT
HE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE THE DAYS OF HIS YOUTH THAT TIME OF LIFE WHICH WITH A CERTAIN SHOW OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN TERMED THE AGE OF INGRATITUDE
A FEW SLIGHT CONCESSIONS ON EITHER SIDE AND ALL MIGHT BE AMICABLY ADJUSTED
OH NO NINA
ABOVE THERE WERE BROAD WHITE BANDS DARKENED ON THE SIDE AVERTED FROM THE SUN EXHIBITING A SLOW BUT UNINTERMITTENT MOVEMENT
VERNE FROM THOSE PAGES WHERE IT APPEARED AS THE LAST LINE
NOTHING COULD LOOK PLAINER AND IF THE PROFESSOR'S CALCULATIONS WERE CORRECT A POINT UPON WHICH THEY DARED NOT IF THEY WOULD EXPRESS THE SEMBLANCE OF A DOUBT GALLIA WOULD ACCOMPLISH HER REVOLUTION IN PRECISELY TWO YEARS AND WOULD MEET THE EARTH WHICH WOULD IN THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME HAVE COMPLETED TWO ANNUAL REVOLUTIONS IN THE VERY SAME SPOT AS BEFORE
THIS WAS IMMEDIATELY PUSHED OFF FROM SHORE AND WAS SOON ALONGSIDE A PLEASURE-YACHT THAT WAS LYING TO NOT MANY CABLE LENGTHS AWAY
CAPTAIN SERVADAC DECLARED HIMSELF QUITE EQUAL TO THE UNDERTAKING
AND WHEN NOW HE WAS OBLIGED WITH HIS OWN EYES TO WITNESS THE WAVES OF OCEAN ROLLING OVER WHAT ONCE HAD BEEN THE LOVELY SHORES OF PROVENCE HE WAS WELL-NIGH FRANTIC WITH DESPERATION
IF YOU WILL LOOK YOU WILL SEE THE ZONE MARKED CLEARLY ENOUGH UPON THE MAP WITHOUT NOTICING THE INTERRUPTION SERVADAC CONTINUED HIS OWN REMARKS THE COMET THEN I SEE IS TO REACH ITS APHELION ON THE 15TH OF JANUARY EXACTLY A TWELVEMONTH AFTER PASSING ITS PERIHELION A TWELVEMONTH
AND HAD SHE NOW APPROACHED TO BE A SATELLITE OF THE NEW-BORN WORLD
THE SAILS WERE ACCORDINGLY TAKEN IN A LITTLE AND IN SPITE OF THE INTENSITY OF THE COLD THE EXPLORERS VENTURED OUT OF THEIR SHELTER IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT RECONNOITER THE PLAIN WHICH WAS APPARENTLY AS BOUNDLESS AS EVER
NO ONE GRIEVED OVER THE LIFE OF SOLITUDE WHICH HAKKABUT PERSISTED IN LEADING
AND THIRDLY ITS DENSITY OR QUANTITY OF MATTER IN A UNIT OF ITS VOLUME
NICE LITTLE COMET
IT MUST NOW BE SOME TIME IN MARCH YES SAID THE PROFESSOR TO-DAY IS THE 26TH OF MARCH
THEN IN A VOICE OF REAL CONCERN HE INQUIRED WHETHER ANYTHING COULD BE DONE TO AVERT THE CALAMITY
IF THUS THEN IT WAS WITHIN THE POWER OF THE UNKNOWN WRITER TO ESTIMATE WITH SUCH APPARENT CERTAINTY GALLIA'S EXACT POSITION WAS IT NOT LIKELY THAT HIS MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS WOULD ENABLE HIM TO ARRIVE AT SOME DEFINITE CONCLUSION AS TO THE DATE AT WHICH SHE WOULD BEGIN AGAIN TO APPROACH THE SUN
PLAGUE ON IT REPEATED THE CAPTAIN
AND TRUE IT WAS THAT THE FLAG THAT FLOATED AT THE HEAD OF YONDER MAST WAS THE BLUE CROSS OF RUSSIA
A JOURNEY AND A DISAPPOINTMENT IT WAS AS THE PROFESSOR HAD SAID
THE PROSPECTS OF THE MORROW OFFERED SERIOUS MATTER FOR CONSIDERATION
THE RECOLLECTION OF THIS FACT SERVED TO RECONCILE THEM IN A GREAT DEGREE TO THE CHANGE TO WHICH THEY FELT IT REQUISITE TO SUBMIT
ON ONE OF THE CARDS WAS INSCRIBED
FROM CAPE MATAFUZ TO TUNIS IT HAD ALL GONE AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN
HAVEN'T I HEARD OF MEN MORE DRIED UP THAN HE IS BEING BROUGHT ALL THE WAY FROM EGYPT IN CASES COVERED WITH PICTURES YOU IDIOT!--THOSE WERE MUMMIES
HERE THERE WAS A POPULATION OF TWENTY-TWO WHO WOULD ALL HAVE TO SUBSIST UPON THE NATURAL PRODUCTS OF THE SOIL
THROW NINA THROW AS HARD AS YOU CAN NINA BALANCED THE PIECE OF ICE TWO OR THREE TIMES IN HER HAND AND THREW IT FORWARD WITH ALL HER STRENGTH
CAPTAIN SERVADAC BRIEFLY DREW ATTENTION TO THESE POINTS AND CONCLUDED BY SAYING MY FRIENDS WE MUST WITHOUT DELAY HASTEN TO THE ASSISTANCE OF THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN FOR MY PART SAID THE COUNT I AM QUITE READY TO ACCOMPANY YOU
NOT ONE BRANCH OF A TREE HAD BEEN SEEN DRIFTING BY NOR ONE SPAR BELONGING TO ONE OF THE NUMEROUS VESSELS THAT A MONTH PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN MOORED IN THE MAGNIFICENT BAY WHICH STRETCHED TWELVE MILES ACROSS FROM CAPE MATAFUZ TO POINT PEXADE
ON THE NIGHT OF THE 31ST OF DECEMBER HE SAID I WAS PROCEEDING BY SEA TO OUR APPOINTED PLACE OF MEETING WHEN MY YACHT WAS SUDDENLY CAUGHT ON THE CREST OF AN ENORMOUS WAVE AND CARRIED TO A HEIGHT WHICH IT IS BEYOND MY POWER TO ESTIMATE
PROVIDED WITH A COMPASS A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF COLD MEAT AND A SPIRIT LAMP BY WHICH HE MIGHT BOIL HIS COFFEE HE WAS PERFECTLY SURE HE SHOULD WITHOUT THE LEAST DIFFICULTY ACCOMPLISH AN ENTERPRISE THAT CHIMED IN SO EXACTLY WITH HIS ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT
THAT FLAG YOU KNOW HAS BEEN HOISTED BUT A FEW SHORT WEEKS THAT FLAG HAS FLOATED WHERE IT IS FOR AGES ASSERTED THE COLONEL
AT THE FOOT OF THE PYLONE STOOD A MISERABLE SHED ITS SHUTTERS TIGHTLY CLOSED
THEY WILL BE INTERESTED IN THE RESULT OF OUR VOYAGE FOR MY PART SAID SERVADAC I HAVE NO DESIRE THAT WAY
BUT STILL ALL IN VAIN
THERE WAS A DEAD LEVEL OF DULLNESS
A SUPPLY OF SKATES FOUND HIDDEN AWAY AMONGST THE DOBRYNA'S STORES WAS SPEEDILY BROUGHT INTO USE
AND THEY ARE NOT MISTAKEN
AN ENORMOUS FRAGMENT HAD BEEN DETACHED AND LAUNCHED INTO SPACE
THESE ELEMENTS WERE
YOU KNOW WE SHALL NEVER GET THERE
AND NOW GENTLEMEN WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THESE COINS WEIGH HERE UPON GALLIA HE SUSPENDED THE MONEY BAG TO THE HOOK
CAPTAIN SERVADAC WAS A GASCON AND GASCONS ARE PROVERBIALLY POOR
NOT ONLY THEREFORE WAS IT EVIDENT THAT THE SUBMERGED CHAIN BETWEEN CAPE BON AND CAPE FURINA NO LONGER EXISTED BUT IT WAS EQUALLY CLEAR THAT THE CONVULSION HAD CAUSED A GENERAL LEVELING OF THE SEA-BOTTOM AND THAT THE SOIL DEGENERATED AS IT HAS BEEN SAID INTO A METALLIC DUST OF UNRECOGNIZED COMPOSITION BORE NO TRACE OF THE SPONGES SEA-ANEMONES STAR-FISH SEA-NETTLES HYDROPHYTES AND SHELLS WITH WHICH THE SUBMARINE ROCKS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN HAD HITHERTO BEEN PRODIGALLY CLOTHED
JOY SHOUTED SERVADAC HALF BESIDE HIMSELF WITH ECSTASY
THE HORSES WERE CLOGGED AND TURNED OUT TO FEED UPON THE RICH PASTURE THAT CLOTHED THE SHORE AND THE NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT SPECIAL INCIDENT
THE SEA THREATENED TO BE UN-NAVIGABLE VERY SOON AS ICE WAS ALREADY FORMING WHICH THE NOONDAY SUN WAS UNABLE TO MELT
A FETE DAY THE TEMPERATURE CONTINUED TO DECREASE
TWO YEARS IN THE 8TH REGIMENT OF THE LINE
LIGHT AND UNIMPEDED THE YAWL SCUDDED ON WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED
BUT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THEIR DOUBTS OR ANXIETIES THEY WERE FAIN TO KEEP ALL THEIR MISGIVINGS TO THEMSELVES
SO INTENTLY HAD THEY EACH SEPARATELY BEEN FOLLOWING THEIR OWN TRAIN OF THOUGHT THAT DAYLIGHT REAPPEARED ALMOST BEFORE THE TRAVELERS WERE AWARE OF IT
NATURE PROVIDES THAT
THE JEW STILL SPLUTTERED AND MOANED AND HESITATED
THE ASCENDING SMOKE THAT ROSE ABOVE THE ROCK WAS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT GOOD FIRES WERE STILL KEPT UP
DURING FOUR MONTHS OR THEREABOUTS THEY WOULD LEAD THE LIVES OF FARMERS AND OF SPORTSMEN
HARDLY TWENTY LEAGUES FROM SPAIN
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EVERY RIFT IN THE FOG HE MADE TEN TWENTY THIRTY OBSERVATIONS BOTH IN RIGHT ASCENSION AND IN DECLINATION AND SUCCEEDED IN WORKING OUT WITH THE MOST MINUTE ACCURACY THE FIVE ELEMENTS OF THE COMET WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY ADVANCING WITH ASTOUNDING RAPIDITY TOWARDS THE EARTH
AND AT LAST THE SUMMIT OF THE VOLCANO WITH ITS CORONA OF VAPOR WAS ENTIRELY OUT OF SIGHT
AND AS FOR COUNT TIMASCHEFF WITHOUT FINISHING HIS SENTENCE
THE SOLE SOURCE OF THE HEAT THAT HAD ENABLED THEM TO BRAVE THE RIGOR OF THE COLD HAD FAILED THEM
CONFOUND IT HE CRIED IF THIS IS NEITHER VENUS NOR MERCURY IT MUST BE THE MOON
FIVE-FRANC PIECES
OUR OWN DISPATCH TO THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY STILL AWAITS THE MAIL BUT ALLOW ME TO REPEAT INSISTED SERVADAC THAT WE ARE NO LONGER ON THE EARTH ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO COME IN CONTACT WITH IT AGAIN IN ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS I HAVE NO DOUBT THE MAJOR ANSWERED THAT ENGLAND WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO RECLAIM US SERVADAC FELT PERPLEXED
ONLY AFRICA ISN'T BY ANY MEANS WHERE WE EXPECTED TO FIND IT AND FRANCE
THE PROFESSOR IT IS TRUE IN HIS ESTIMATE OF THE DURATION OF HIS COMET'S REVOLUTION HAD REPRESENTED THAT HE HAD MADE ALL PROPER ALLOWANCES FOR ANY PERTURBATIONS THAT WOULD BE CAUSED EITHER BY JUPITER BY SATURN OR BY MARS
AREA OF SURFACE 630,000 READ THE CAPTAIN
HE WOULD GET GOOD PRICES AND HE WOULD GET FINE INTEREST
THE WATERS OF THE GALLIAN SEA WERE IMPRISONED BENEATH THE SOLID SHEET WHICH BECAME CONTINUALLY STOUTER IN THE INCREASING COLD
AND THE DAYS AND NIGHTS WERE STILL DIVIDED INTO PERIODS OF PRECISELY SIX HOURS EACH--A SURE PROOF THAT THE SUN REMAINED CLOSE TO THE NEW EQUATOR WHICH MANIFESTLY PASSED THROUGH GOURBI ISLAND
A FEW BOOKS AND INSTRUMENTS AND TWO MONTHS VICTUALS WAS ALL THE BAGGAGE HE TOOK WITH HIM EXCEPT AN EXCELLENT ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPE WHICH WAS INDEED ALMOST PART AND PARCEL OF HIMSELF AND WITH WHICH HE ASSIDUOUSLY SCANNED THE HEAVENS IN THE SANGUINE ANTICIPATION OF MAKING SOME DISCOVERY WHICH WOULD IMMORTALIZE HIS NAME
AND THUS ALTHOUGH THE STEAM WAS FORCED ON TO THE EXTREMEST LIMIT CONSISTENT WITH SAFETY THE VESSEL HELD HER WAY WITH THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY AND RECOILED BEFORE THE HURRICANE
I WANT A WORD WITH YOU SAID SERVADAC BUT I DO NOT WANT TO STAND TALKING OUT HERE IN THE COLD FOLLOWED BY THE REST OF THE PARTY HE PROCEEDED TO MOUNT THE STEPS
BUT STILL HE SHOULD HAVE GOODS LEFT AND THEY WOULD WANT THESE
BUT THE PROFESSOR WAS IN THE WORST OF TEMPERS
LONG AND LOUD WERE THE LAMENTATIONS OF THE JEW
BY JINGO HE EXCLAIMED A PRECIOUS HOT FIRE SERVADAC REFLECTED
AND MOREOVER THAT THEY SHOULD BE INVITED TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE POPULATION OF NINA'S HIVE IN THE EVENT OF ANY MEASURES BEING SUGGESTED BY WHICH THE SHOCK OF THE APPROACHING COLLISION COULD BE MITIGATED
THOUGH FAR FROM BEING ADVANCED IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO A CERTAIN DEGREE IN ITS ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES
THE POLE-STAR BEING MANIFESTLY THUS DISPLACED IT REMAINED TO BE DISCOVERED WHETHER ANY OTHER OF THE CELESTIAL BODIES HAD BECOME A FIXED CENTER AROUND WHICH THE CONSTELLATIONS MADE THEIR APPARENT DAILY REVOLUTIONS
HIS SUPERFICIES 144,000 MILLIONS OF SQUARE MILES
SHE WAS OUT OF PLACE
IT DID NOT OFFER A SINGLE HARBOR OF REFUGE BUT SMOOTH AND PERPENDICULAR AS THE WALLS OF A FORTRESS IT ROSE TO A HEIGHT OF TWO HUNDRED AND OCCASIONALLY OF THREE HUNDRED FEET
THE PROFESSOR WAS OF A TEMPER FAR TOO CROSS-GRAINED FOR THEM TO VENTURE TO ASK HIM TO REVISE OR RE-EXAMINE THE RESULTS OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
ADAPTING HER COURSE TO THESE DEVIATIONS OF THE COASTLINE THE DOBRYNA WAS STEERING NORTHWARDS AND HAD BARELY REACHED THE LIMIT OF THE BAY WHEN THE ATTENTION OF ALL ON BOARD WAS ARRESTED BY THE PHENOMENON OF A VOLCANO AT LEAST 3,000 FEET HIGH ITS CRATER CROWNED WITH SMOKE WHICH OCCASIONALLY WAS STREAKED BY TONGUES OF FLAME
IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH I THINK THAT BEFORE LONG THE SEA WILL BE FROZEN OVER AND NAVIGATION WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AFTER LEAVING THE ISLAND THE DOBRYNA HAD PASSED OVER THE SITES WHERE TENES CHERCHIL KOLEAH AND SIDI-FERUCH ONCE HAD BEEN BUT OF THESE TOWNS NOT ONE APPEARED WITHIN RANGE OF THE TELESCOPE
BUT REMEMBERING ROSETTE'S DISLIKE TO VISITORS HE ALTERED HIS MIND AND SENT YOUNG PABLO UP TO THE OBSERVATORY WITH A FORMAL NOTE REQUESTING THE PLEASURE OF PROFESSOR ROSETTE'S COMPANY AT THE NEW YEAR'S FETE
AND THE ANIMAL AS IF COMPREHENDING WHAT WAS SAID TROTTED ON GENTLY FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED PACES AND STOPPED IN FRONT OF A KIND OF CAVE OR BURROW THAT WAS HALF CONCEALED BY A GROVE OF LENTISKS
MEANWHILE THE THREE TOGETHER HAD NO HESITATION IN EXAMINING HIS PAPERS AND SCRUTINIZING THE FIGURES ON HIS EXTEMPORIZED BLACKBOARD
WE HAVE HAD OUR WARNING AND UNLESS OUR REPRESENTATIONS CAN INDUCE THEM TO YIELD THEIR POSITION WE MUST RESIGN OUR HOPE THUS DISCOMFITED THEY HAD REACHED THE FOOT OF THE ROCK WHEN ALL AT ONCE LIKE A JACK-IN-THE-BOX A SENTINEL STARTED UP BEFORE THEM WITH THE CHALLENGE
THE MONTHS STILL GLIDED ON
AND THEN OBEDIENT TO THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION HE DESCENDED WITH INCREASING RAPIDITY AND ALIGHTED UPON THE EARTH WITHOUT EXPERIENCING A SHOCK GREATER THAN IF HE HAD MERELY MADE A BOUND OF FOUR OR FIVE FEET HIGH
NOT SO MUCH AS A SINGLE POINT OF ROCK RELIEVED THE BARE UNIFORMITY OF ITS SURFACE
THE WIND DROPPED
THIS WAS ABOUT TWELVE MILES FROM THE MINA AND ON THE SITE OF THE ANNEX OR SUBURB OF SURKELMITTOO
IT IS TRUE THAT HER AXIS IS NOT SO MUCH INCLINED AS TO PROLONG DAY AND NIGHT AS AT THE POLES OF THE EARTH BUT THE RAYS OF THE SUN MUST REACH US HERE ONLY VERY OBLIQUELY AND THE COLD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WILL BE INTENSE SO COLD DO YOU THINK ASKED SERVADAC THAT ANIMAL LIFE MUST BE EXTINCT I DO NOT SAY THAT CAPTAIN ANSWERED THE LIEUTENANT
HEAVEN BE PRAISED CRIED SERVADAC WITH GLAD EMOTION
IT IS NOT FOR MAN TO DISTURB THE ORDER OF THE UNIVERSE
TEN MINUTES LATER AND THEY WERE SO NEAR THE ROCK THAT THE LIEUTENANT TOOK IN HIS SAIL CONVINCED THAT THE IMPETUS ALREADY ATTAINED WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO CARRY HIM TO THE LAND
SERVADAC DON'T BE THOUGHTLESS CRIED ROSETTE WITH ALL THE PETULANT IMPATIENCE OF THE OLD PEDAGOGUE
THE TWO OFFICERS LISTENED GRAVELY ENOUGH TO SERVADAC'S REQUEST THAT THEY WOULD ACT AS HIS SECONDS IN AN AFFAIR OF HONOR BUT COULD NOT RESIST A SMILE ON HEARING THAT THE DISPUTE BETWEEN HIM AND THE COUNT HAD ORIGINATED IN A MUSICAL DISCUSSION
BUT ROSETTE NO DOUBT COULD ANSWER THE QUESTION DIRECTLY AND THE TIME HAD NOW ARRIVED IN WHICH HE MUST BE COMPELLED TO DIVULGE THE PRECISE MOMENT OF COLLISION
THE SHADES OF NIGHT WERE DRAWING ON
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED THAT SERVADAC'S PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WOULD HAVE PREPARED HIM FOR THE DISCOVERY THAT THE CATASTROPHE WHICH HAD OVERWHELMED OTHER SITES HAD BROUGHT DESTRUCTION TO HIS OWN COUNTRY AS WELL
WHAT IS IT BEN ZOOF ASKED THE CAPTAIN
GENTLEMEN HE SAID WITH THESE FRANC PIECES I OBTAIN THE MEANS OF DETERMINING ACCURATELY BOTH A METER AND A KILOGRAMME CHAPTER VII
MALTA--TOWN FORTS SOLDIERS GOVERNOR AND ALL--HAS VANISHED JUST LIKE ALGERIA FOR A MOMENT A CLOUD RESTED UPON THE COLONEL'S BROW ONLY TO GIVE PLACE TO AN EXPRESSION OF DECIDED INCREDULITY
THE SURPRISE ONLY KINDLED THEIR EMOTION TO YET KEENER INTENSITY AND IT WOULD BE HARD TO DESCRIBE THE EXCITEMENT WITH WHICH THEY GAZED AT THE PANORAMA THAT WAS BEFORE THEM
BUT IT BECAME GENERALLY NOTICED THAT SOMETHING WAS VERY SERIOUSLY DISTURBING THE PROFESSOR'S EQUANIMITY
EVEN AFTER THE TURNING-POINT IN THEIR CAREER THEY KNEW THAT AT LEAST NINE MONTHS WOULD HAVE TO ELAPSE BEFORE THE SEA WOULD BE OPEN TO NAVIGATION
INDEED WE HAVE RECEIVED NO ORDERS AT ALL
THE STEELYARD WAS THEN PRODUCED
A MONTGOLFIER CRIED SERVADAC
A GOOD THING THE OLD FELLOW WASN'T THERE TO SEE OBSERVED BEN ZOOF
20 DEGREES N AND FELL IN THE HEART OF THE DESERT
SUDDENLY AN IDEA STRUCK SERVADAC'S MIND
THE CATTLE WERE BROWSING QUIETLY UPON THE PASTURES THAT WERE MOIST WITH THE DEW OF AN ORDINARY JANUARY MORNING
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE WIND WOULD CARRY HER RAPIDLY ALONG THE ICE THE IDEA SEEMED ADMIRABLE
GROPED THEIR WAY INTO THE COMMON HALL
NOW OLD HAKKABUT COME OUT OF YOUR SHELL
AND YET HE ARGUED WITH HIMSELF IF OUR ENCAMPMENT HAS BEEN PROJECTED TO SO GREAT AN ELEVATION HOW IS IT THAT THE SEA REMAINS AT ITS PROPER LEVEL ONCE AGAIN HECTOR SERVADAC THOUGH CAPABLE OF TRACING CONSEQUENCES FELT HIMSELF TOTALLY AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND THEIR CAUSE
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED
ICE FOR THIS PURPOSE MUST BE PERPETUALLY CARRIED IN FROM THE COAST AND IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO ARRANGE THAT EVERYONE IN TURN SHOULD PERFORM THIS OFFICE AS IT WOULD BE NO SINECURE TO CLAMBER UP THE SIDES OF THE CRATER FOR 900 FEET AND DESCEND THE SAME DISTANCE WITH A HEAVY BURDEN
ALLOW ME TO EXPRESS MY SURPRISE RESUMED THE CAPTAIN AT SEEING YOU INSTALLED AS COMMANDING OFFICER UPON WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD TO BE SPANISH SOIL
THE PROBABILITY IS THAT IT WOULD BE SO
IF OUR WORLD HAS BECOME SO INSIGNIFICANT A SPHEROID NOT ONLY HAS ITS GRAVITY DIMINISHED BUT ITS ROTARY SPEED HAS BEEN ACCELERATED
AND WHY NOT CAPTAIN REJOINED THE LIEUTENANT
THOSE TOWARD THE POLES WERE ALTERNATELY DARK AND LIGHT
PERHAPS ENGLAND WAS ENGROSSED WITH DOMESTIC MATTERS OR PERHAPS SHE WAS ABSORBED IN DIPLOMATIC DIFFICULTIES
IT WAS HARDLY THE WORK FOR LITTLE FINGERS BUT NINA PERSISTED IN ACCOMPLISHING HER OWN SHARE OF IT
AND THE NECESSARY INFERENCE THAT LIEUTENANT PROCOPE DREW FROM THE ROUND OF THE EARTH BEING COMPLETED IN 1,400 MILES WAS THAT THE EARTH'S DIAMETER HAD BEEN REDUCED BY ABOUT FIFTEEN SIXTEENTHS OF ITS LENGTH
BUT NEITHER SWORD NOR PISTOL CAN FORCE ME TO FOREGO MY PRETENSIONS
TELL ME ALL YOU CAN ABOUT THIS FORMIDABLE NEIGHBOR THE LIEUTENANT HAVING REFRESHED HIS MEMORY BY REFERENCE TO FLAMMARION'S RECITS DE L'INFINI OF WHICH HE HAD A RUSSIAN TRANSLATION AND SOME OTHER BOOKS PROCEEDED TO RECAPITULATE THAT JUPITER ACCOMPLISHES HIS REVOLUTION ROUND THE SUN IN 4,332 DAYS 14 HOURS AND 2 MINUTES
IT IS THE OLD MAN'S TURN AND THEN A VOICE AT ONCE GRUFF AND HARSH WAS HEARD VOCIFERATING MY MONEY
THE STREAM OF BURNING LAVA THAT IS FLOWING THERE IS THE GIFT OF A BOUNTEOUS PROVIDENCE
THIS COLOSSAL BOUNDARY THEN STRETCHED AWAY FOR NEARLY 150 LEAGUES OVER THE SAHARA DESERT AND EXTENDING TO THE SOUTH OF GOURBI ISLAND OCCUPIED WHAT IF MOROCCO HAD STILL EXISTED WOULD HAVE BEEN ITS NATURAL FRONTIER
BUT THE MOST PROJECTING ROCK OF CEUTA HAD BEEN UNDISTURBED BY THE GENERAL CATASTROPHE AND HALF A SCORE OF SPANIARDS WHO HAD HAPPENED TO BE UPON IT HAD ESCAPED WITH THEIR LIVES
SUPPOSE HIM STATIONED ON THE SURFACE OF CAPELLA
THE SPOT CHOSEN FOR THE EXCAVATION WAS A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE GOURBI ON A SLIGHT ELEVATION OF THE SOIL
IT WILL BE EASILY IMAGINED THAT ISAAC HAKKABUT THUS CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP WAS JEERED MOST UNMERCIFULLY BY THOSE WHOM HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE HIS DUPES
CONFIDENT IN THE SKILL OF THEIR COMMANDER AND IN THE STABILITY OF THEIR SHIP THEY PERFORMED THEIR DUTIES WITH STEADINESS AND UNQUESTIONING OBEDIENCE
AM I TO BELIEVE THAT GOURBI ISLAND THAT LITTLE SHRED OF ALGERIA CONSTITUTES ALL THAT IS LEFT OF OUR GLORIOUS FRANCE
I HAVE NOT ASKED YOU FOR CREDIT
YES SIR MAJOR OLIPHANT OFFICER IN COMMAND OF THE GARRISON AT CEUTA WAS THE ENGLISHMAN'S REPLY
AND I THOUGHT--I THOUGHT--I THOUGHT WELL YOU THOUGHT--WHAT DID YOU THINK WHY THAT PERHAPS THE STRANGER HAD COME FROM THE NORTHERN SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND THAT I MIGHT ASK HIM HE PAUSED AGAIN AND GAVE A GLANCE AT THE CAPTAIN
TO MY MIND THE THEORY MEETS ALL OBJECTIONS I THINK NOT SERVADAC ANSWERED
OLD NEBUCHADNEZZAR WHERE ARE YOU SHOUTED BEN ZOOF AT THE FULL STRENGTH OF HIS LUNGS
AND PRAY WHO TOLD YOU THIS AGAIN SAID THE PROFESSOR WITH A SNEER
THE PARTY WAS ON THE POINT OF ENTERING THE THICKET WHEN A SINGULAR SPECTACLE MADE THEM PAUSE
HIS WEIGHTS DECEIVE STOP STOP INTERPOSED SERVADAC
IT WILL GIVE US UNBOUNDED PLEASURE TO SHAKE HANDS AGAIN WITH SOME OF OUR FELLOW-CREATURES
OUT OF THE WAY OLD HAKKABUT I SAY
SHE WAS A COLONEL'S WIDOW YOUNG AND HANDSOME VERY RESERVED NOT TO SAY HAUGHTY IN HER MANNER AND EITHER INDIFFERENT OR IMPERVIOUS TO THE ADMIRATION WHICH SHE INSPIRED
THE STOCK OF FUEL WAS TOO LIMITED TO KEEP UP A PERMANENT SUPPLY OF HEAT IN THEIR PRESENT QUARTERS AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY MUST BE DRIVEN TO SEEK SOME OTHER REFUGE THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE OF WHICH WOULD AT LEAST BE BEARABLE
THEN AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED
OF WHAT MATTER IT IS COMPOSED AND HOW IT RESISTS DISINTEGRATION IS STILL AN UNSETTLED QUESTION
BUT ANYHOW IT WILL NOT DO TO LEAVE THE TARTAN HERE
YOUR EXCELLENCY JESTS HE SAID IN FRENCH
IT WAS STRONGLY CORROBORATED BY THE REDUCTION OF THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF THE SUN'S DISC TO THE PRECISE DIMENSIONS WHICH IT WOULD ASSUME TO AN OBSERVER ACTUALLY STATIONED ON THE SURFACE OF MARS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED THE VOICES OF THE LISTENERS
AND FOR THIS PURPOSE HE REPEATEDLY MADE HIS WAY UP TO THE GROTTO ABOVE WHERE IN SPITE OF THE EXTREME SEVERITY OF THE COLD HE WOULD PERSEVERE IN THE USE OF HIS TELESCOPE TILL HE WAS ALL BUT PARALYZED
THE MOST DARING IMAGINATION COULD NOT SUPPOSE THAT A PERIOD OF 12,000 YEARS HAD BEEN CROWDED INTO THE SPACE OF A FORTNIGHT
HE DEEPLY REGRETTED THAT HE HAD NOT A PAIR OF COMMON SCALES ON BOARD
AND IN NEITHER OF THESE CASES SHOULD WE HAVE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF MAKING THIS MARVELOUS EXCURSION THROUGH UNTRAVERSED SOLAR REGIONS
THIRDLY THAT IT MIGHT BE DIVERTED INTO A NEW ORBIT WHICH WOULD NEVER BE COINCIDENT WITH THE ECLIPTIC
THEY HAD SIMPLY REACHED A CRISIS IN WHICH ONE OF THEM WAS DE TROP WHICH OF THEM FATE MUST DECIDE
FOR SEVERAL SUCCEEDING DAYS HE SCANNED THE HORIZON UNINTERMITTENTLY WITH HIS TELESCOPE
HAVING THIS ULTIMATE OBJECT IN VIEW HE ASSEMBLED HIS LITTLE COLONY UPON A PROJECTING ROCK AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE PROMONTORY AND HAVING CALLED NINA AND PABLO OUT TO HIM IN FRONT HE SAID
AND SIXTY MILES OF THE SHORE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN ITSELF MAKING IN ALL AN ENTIRE CIRCUMFERENCE OF ABOUT 171 MILES
THEIR LITTLE COMET THEY KNEW WAS FAR SAFER WHERE IT WAS
BEN ZOOF LOOKED ON AND LAUGHED MAKING NO ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE
WITH A FAVORABLE WIND SHE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE MADE ELEVEN KNOTS AN HOUR HAD NOT THE HIGH WAVES SOMEWHAT IMPEDED HER PROGRESS
THEIR ISLAND WAS MINED WITH SUBTERRANEAN STORES MORE THAN AMPLE FOR THIRTEEN MEN--NAY FOR THIRTEEN ENGLISHMEN--FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AT LEAST
HE WILL DO IT WELL FOR YOU IF YOU WILL GIVE HIM THE PRECISE MEASUREMENT WHAT
AFTER DINNER LEAVING HIS ORDERLY TO STOW AWAY THE REMAINS OF THE REPAST IN WHAT HE WAS PLEASED TO TERM THE CUPBOARD OF HIS STOMACH CAPTAIN SERVADAC TURNED OUT INTO THE OPEN AIR TO SMOKE HIS PIPE UPON THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
ENVIOUS TONGUES INDEED MIGHT PRONOUNCE IT LITTLE MORE THAN A HILL
FORTUNATELY THE DEEP STRIAE OR FURROWS IN THE SURFACE OF THE ROCKS THAT MADE THE BOTTOM OF THE RAVINE IN SOME DEGREE FACILITATED THEIR PROGRESS BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL THEY HAD BEEN TOILING UP FOR TWO HOURS MORE THAT THEY SUCCEEDED IN REACHING THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF
ALL AT ONCE HIS EYE BRIGHTENED
THIS WAS THE FINDING OF A SECOND MYSTERIOUS DOCUMENT IN CHARACTER PRECISELY SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY HAD FOUND BEFORE
HOW NOW BEN ZOOF SAID THE CAPTAIN SHARPLY
INDUBITABLY TO LESS THAN 1,400 MILES
IT WARMS THE BLOOD
BESIDES DISCOVERING THREE OF THE LATEST OF THE TELESCOPIC PLANETS HE HAD WORKED OUT THE ELEMENTS OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH COMET IN THE CATALOGUE
A GROUP OF SPANIARDS HAD JUST BEGUN DANCING THEIR NATIONAL FANDANGO AND THE EXTRAORDINARY LIGHTNESS WHICH HAD BECOME THE PHYSICAL PROPERTY OF EVERY OBJECT IN THE NEW PLANET MADE THE DANCERS BOUND TO A HEIGHT OF THIRTY FEET OR MORE INTO THE AIR CONSIDERABLY ABOVE THE TOPS OF THE TREES
BY TRAVELING DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT INTERMISSION WE SHALL NOT BE MORE THAN THREE DAYS IN REACHING FORMENTERA BELIEVE ME PERSISTED THE LIEUTENANT CALMLY YOUR ENTHUSIASM IS CARRYING YOU TOO FAR
HER CRUISE HAD LASTED FROM THE 31ST OF JANUARY TO THE 5TH OF MARCH A PERIOD OF THIRTY-FIVE DAYS FOR IT WAS LEAP YEAR CORRESPONDING TO SEVENTY DAYS AS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE NEW LITTLE WORLD
ALTHOUGH IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY ARE NOT ORDINARILY VISIBLE ON EARTH WITHOUT THE AID OF A SOMEWHAT POWERFUL TELESCOPE IT HAS BEEN ASSERTED THAT A FAVORED FEW ENDUED WITH EXTRAORDINARY POWERS OF VISION HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY THEM WITH AN UNASSISTED EYE
HERE IS ALL THAT WE HOPED FOR AND MORE BESIDES CHAPTER XXI
CAPTAIN SERVADAC MADE A POINT OF SHOWING HIMSELF QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC IN HIS ANTICIPATIONS AND TO BEN ZOOF THE GOING UP IN A BALLOON WAS THE SUPREME HEIGHT OF HIS AMBITION
LET US HEAR
ARE YOU IN A GREAT HURRY ASKED THE PROFESSOR COOLLY
AND MIGHTN'T ONE AS WELL LIVE UPON AN EXPLODING BOMB?--WITH MUCH MORE TO THE SAME EFFECT
THENCE ONWARD TO THE ISLAND WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ASSURED ON EVIDENCE THAT THEY COULD NOT DISBELIEVE TO BE UPON THE SITE OF GIBRALTAR WAS FOUR DEGREES
NO HURRY AT ALL OBSERVED THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS NOT IN THE LEAST IMPATIENT TO CONTINUE HIS MATHEMATICAL EXERCISES
NONSENSE EXCLAIMED SERVADAC
THESE MEN WITHOUT EXCEPTION WERE ALL SONS OF THE COUNT'S TENANTS AND SO TENACIOUSLY EVEN OUT AT SEA DID THEY CLING TO THEIR OLD TRADITIONS THAT IT MATTERED LITTLE TO THEM WHAT PHYSICAL DISORGANIZATION ENSUED SO LONG AS THEY FELT THEY WERE SHARING THE EXPERIENCES OF THEIR LORD AND MASTER
CONFOUND IT I HAVE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH TWENTY TIMES
YOUR PAY WILL CONTINUE AS BEFORE
ANYHOW THERE WOULD BE THE SHERIFF
THE IDENTICAL PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE OCCURRED AT THE SUMMIT OF A MOUNTAIN 35,000 FEET HIGH
I HAVE COME MAJOR OLIPHANT IN THE HOPE OF DOING YOU AND YOUR COMPANIONS A SERVICE REPLIED SERVADAC ROUSING HIMSELF FROM HIS REVERIE
REGARDLESS OF THE RIDICULE WHICH HIS ABJECT WRETCHEDNESS EXCITED HE HOWLED ON STILL AND KEPT UP AN UNENDING WAIL
IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE NERINA IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT HE SHOULD MAKE SEVERAL ACTUAL OBSERVATIONS AT VARIOUS POINTS OF THE ORBIT
PRESENTLY BEN ZOOF ASKED WHETHER IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE COMET TO FALL INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC
WE MUST TRY AND LEAVE GALLIA BEFORE THE SHOCK LEAVE GALLIA
IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT THE QUESTION BEGAN TO BE MOOTED WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT TO REOPEN SOME COMMUNICATION WITH THE ENGLISHMEN AT GIBRALTAR
THE DISTANCES OF SEVERAL OF THE BRIGHTEST OF THE FIXED STARS HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED
TRULY WITH THE CONSTANT RISING AND SETTING OF THE SATELLITES SOME WITH BRIGHT DISCS AT THEIR FULL OTHERS LIKE SILVER CRESCENTS IN QUADRATURE AS WELL AS BY THE ENCIRCLING RINGS THE ASPECT OF THE HEAVENS FROM THE SURFACE OF SATURN MUST BE AS IMPRESSIVE AS IT IS GORGEOUS
A POUND OF COFFEE OLD NATHAN
HE HAD NO EYES EXCEPT FOR THE ONE OBJECT OF HIS NOTICE NO THOUGHTS APART FROM THAT ONE QUARTER OF THE FIRMAMENT
EVEN SO WE SHOULD ONLY BE ADDING THE FATE OF DROWNING TO THE LIST OF OUR OTHER PERILS THEN AS I UNDERSTAND SAID CAPTAIN SERVADAC IN WHATEVER WAY OR IN WHATEVER PLACE THE CONCUSSION OCCURS WE MUST BE EITHER CRUSHED SUFFOCATED ROASTED OR DROWNED
SUCH WAS THE WAY IN WHICH A LONG SILENCE WAS BROKEN ON THE MORNING OF THE 17TH OF FEBRUARY BY THE OLD CALENDAR
THEY ARE THIEVES
GALLIA IS MINE
WELL SIR HERE YOU ARE GOVERNOR GENERAL OF ALGERIA EXCLAIMED BEN ZOOF AS THEY REACHED THE GOURBI
HE YIELDED HOWEVER AFTER A TIME TO SERVADAC'S REPRESENTATIONS THAT IN THE EVENT OF THE EXPEDITION PROVING DISASTROUS THE LITTLE COLONY WOULD NEED HIS SERVICES ALIKE AS GOVERNOR AND PROTECTOR AND OVERCOMING HIS RELUCTANCE TO BE LEFT OUT OF THE PERILOUS ADVENTURE WAS PREVAILED UPON TO REMAIN BEHIND FOR THE GENERAL GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY AT NINA'S HIVE
BUT CATCHING A HINT FROM THE COUNT HE SUBDUED HIS VOICE AND SIMPLY SAID WE HAVE AND MAY I ASK CONTINUED THE PROFESSOR QUITE UNAWARE OF HIS PREVIOUS DISCOURTESY WHETHER WHEN YOU MADE YOUR VOYAGE YOU TOOK ANY ACCOUNT OF DISTANCES AS APPROXIMATELY AS I COULD REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT
IT DID INDEED MORE THAN ONCE OCCUR TO THE MINDS BOTH OF SERVADAC AND HIS FRIENDS THAT IF THEIR CONDITION SHOULD BECOME ONE OF EXTREME EMERGENCY THEY MIGHT AS A LAST RESOURCE BETAKE THEMSELVES TO GIBRALTAR AND THERE SEEK A REFUGE
HERE THEY HALTED
IF THE IMPACT IS SUFFICIENTLY OBLIQUE GALLIA MAY DO PRECISELY WHAT SHE DID BEFORE
BUT BE OFF
PERHAPS THIS STORY WILL BE REMEMBERED WHEN EVEN ROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS AND MICHAEL STROGOFF HAVE BEEN OBLITERATED BY CENTURIES OF TIME
HE WAS FAR TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN HIS OWN APPROPRIATED CORNER EITHER IN CONNING HIS ACCOUNTS OR IN COUNTING HIS MONEY
BEN ZOOF AT ONCE LIGHTED A FIRE SINGING ALL THE TIME ACCORDING TO HIS WONT A SNATCH OF AN OLD MILITARY REFRAIN
THE LAST OF THE COAL HAVING BEEN CONSUMED THE FRAGMENTS OF THE SHIPWRECKED VESSELS HAD TO BE USED DAY BY DAY FOR FUEL
ON THE 4TH OF APRIL AFTER AN ABSENCE OF ABOUT FOUR DAYS THE NEW SATELLITE TO BEN ZOOF'S GREAT SATISFACTION MADE ITS REAPPEARANCE IN A CRESCENT FORM A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SEEMED TO JUSTIFY THE ANTICIPATION THAT HENCEFORWARD IT WOULD CONTINUE TO MAKE A PERIODIC REVOLUTION EVERY FORTNIGHT
HIS NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO DRAW UP A FORMAL REPORT
THE COUSCOUS WAS VERY MUCH IN THE SAME CONDITION
ENGLAND IN EXISTENCE THE COLONEL CRIED
BEING ONLY ABOUT TWELVE MILES DISTANT FROM GIBRALTAR THE LITTLE GARRISON AT CEUTA HAD FELT ITSELF BY NO MEANS ISOLATED IN ITS POSITION
I AM GOING TO HAVE IT CARRIED ACROSS TO LAND AT ONCE NEITHER GROANS NOR TEARS NOR PROTESTATIONS ON THE PART OF THE JEW WERE OF THE SLIGHTEST AVAIL
HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO SERVADAC AND BEGGED HIM TO TELL HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH PITEOUSLY ADDING THAT SURELY IT WAS UNWORTHY OF A FRENCH OFFICER TO DECEIVE A POOR OLD MAN LIKE HIMSELF
DECORATIONS CHEVALIER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR MARCH 13TH 18 HECTOR SERVADAC WAS THIRTY YEARS OF AGE AN ORPHAN WITHOUT LINEAGE AND ALMOST WITHOUT MEANS
HALTS WERE MADE AT REGULAR INTERVALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF TAKING FOOD AND REST
SOME MYSTERIOUS PHENOMENON MUST NOT ONLY HAVE ALTERED THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE SIDEREAL SYSTEM BUT MUST EVEN HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE EARTH'S ROTATION ON HER AXIS
THE PRODUCT IS AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE TEN KILOGRAMMES
SUCH WAS THE STYLE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WAS DAY BY DAY REITERATED DURING THE WHOLE MONTH OF SUSPENSE
CAPTAIN SERVADAC TRIED TO CONSOLE HIMSELF WITH THE REFLECTION THAT GOURBI ISLAND WAS AFTER ALL A FRAGMENT OF A FRENCH COLONY AND AS SUCH ALMOST LIKE A BIT OF HIS DEAR FRANCE
AND INCREDIBLE AS IT MAY SEEM MORE THAN ONE OF THEM WONDERED WHETHER SHE HAD WINGS AND AMONGST THEMSELVES THEY COMMONLY REFERRED TO HER AS THE LITTLE MADONNA SOON OUT OF SIGHT OF MADALENA THE DOBRYNA FOR SOME HOURS HELD A SOUTHEASTERLY COURSE ALONG THE SHORE WHICH HERE WAS FIFTY LEAGUES IN ADVANCE OF THE FORMER COAST-LINE OF ITALY DEMONSTRATING THAT A NEW CONTINENT MUST HAVE BEEN FORMED SUBSTITUTED AS IT WERE FOR THE OLD PENINSULA OF WHICH NOT A VESTIGE COULD BE IDENTIFIED
OUT OF THE WAY AND WITHOUT MORE ADO HE THRUST THE ASTONISHED JEW ON ONE SIDE AND OPENED THE DOOR OF THE CABIN
THE WINTER WHICH THEY WERE EXPECTING WOULD PROBABLY BE OF UNPRECEDENTED LENGTH
ANOTHER INSTANT'S INVESTIGATION HOWEVER REVEALED A BED IN THE EXTREME CORNER AND EXTENDED ON THE BED A HUMAN FORM
THIRTY-SIX HOURS LATER THE BRAVE TRAVELERS WERE GREETED BY THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THEIR FELLOW-COLONISTS WHO HAD BEEN MOST ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THEIR REAPPEARANCE AND THE STILL SENSELESS SAVANT WHO HAD NEITHER OPENED HIS EYES NOR SPOKEN A WORD THROUGHOUT THE JOURNEY WAS SAFELY DEPOSITED IN THE WARMTH AND SECURITY OF THE GREAT HALL OF NINA'S HIVE
ON ONE OCCASION WHEN BEN ZOOF HAD MOUNTED HIS HOBBY-HORSE AND WAS INDULGING IN HIGH-FLOWN PRAISES ABOUT HIS BELOVED EIGHTEENTH ARRONDISSEMENT THE CAPTAIN HAD REMARKED GRAVELY DO YOU KNOW BEN ZOOF THAT MONTMARTRE ONLY REQUIRES A MATTER OF SOME THIRTEEN THOUSAND FEET TO MAKE IT AS HIGH AS MONT BLANC BEN ZOOF'S EYES GLISTENED WITH DELIGHT
NO SAID BEN ZOOF
WHAT IS THE MEASUREMENT OF OUR EQUATOR I ESTIMATE THE TOTAL CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE EQUATOR TO BE ABOUT 1,400 MILES AH SAID THE PROFESSOR MORE THAN HALF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF A CIRCUMFERENCE OF 1,400 MILES WOULD GIVE A DIAMETER OF ABOUT 450 MILES
BEN ZOOF'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH-LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVADAC'S EARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH ARRONDISSEMENT OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMARTRE WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
THOUGH THEY COULD NOT BE SAID TO BE CONSCIOUS OF IT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THEIR FORMER RIVALRY SO COMPLETELY BURIED IN OBLIVION FOR THE LAST YEAR AND TEN MONTHS WAS INSENSIBLY RECOVERING ITS HOLD UPON THEIR MINDS AND THE QUESTION WAS ALL BUT COMING TO THE SURFACE AS TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ON THEIR RETURN TO EARTH THE HANDSOME MADAME DE L SHOULD STILL BE FREE
THE INFERENCE WAS IRRESISTIBLE THAT GALLIA WAS RECEDING FROM THE SUN AND TRAVELING FAR AWAY ACROSS THE PLANETARY REGIONS
IT WAS NOT HOWEVER A BOTTLE
FULL OF SPIRITS THE PARTY LEFT THE HIVE AND CHATTERING AND SINGING AS THEY WENT MADE THEIR WAY DOWN TO THE FROZEN SHORE WHERE THEY FASTENED ON THEIR SKATES
TO DESCRIBE ISAAC HAKKABUT'S RAGE AT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TARTAN WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
MY COMET GRAZED THE EARTH
DETESTABLE OLD WRETCH REPLIED THE COUNT FULL OF DISGUST
IT HAPPENED JUST ABOUT THIS SAME TIME THAT BEN ZOOF HAD BEEN CALLING HIS MASTER'S ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT SOME OF THEIR MOST NECESSARY PROVISIONS WOULD SOON BE RUNNING SHORT AND THAT THEIR STOCK OF COFFEE SUGAR AND TOBACCO WOULD WANT REPLENISHING
AFTER ROUNDING THE PEAK SHE STEERED DIRECT FOR THE CHANNEL TO WHICH SERVADAC BY HIS GESTURES WAS POINTING HER AND WAS NOT LONG IN ENTERING THE CREEK
ON THE 27TH OF JUNE OLD CALENDAR THE PROFESSOR BURST LIKE A CANNON-BALL INTO THE CENTRAL HALL WHERE THEY WERE ALL ASSEMBLED AND WITHOUT A WORD OF SALUTATION OR OF PREFACE ACCOSTED THE LIEUTENANT IN THE WAY IN WHICH IN EARLIER DAYS HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEAK TO AN IDLE SCHOOL-BOY NOW LIEUTENANT
THE SCREW FAILED TO KEEP ITS HOLD UPON THE WATER BUT CONTINUALLY REVOLVED WITH USELESS SPEED IN THE VACANT AIR
HURRYING IN TO ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE HE FOUND ROSETTE IN A STATE OF PERFECT FRENZY IN WHICH ECSTASY AND RAGE SEEMED TO BE STRUGGLING FOR THE PREDOMINANCE
THERE WAS NO MAKER'S NAME TO BE DECIPHERED
THE COUNT AND THE LIEUTENANT FERVENTLY BUT SILENTLY GRASPED HIS HAND
PABLO AND LITTLE NINA WERE ADOPTED THE ONE BY SERVADAC THE OTHER BY THE COUNT AND UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THEIR GUARDIANS WERE WELL EDUCATED AND CARED FOR
ACCORDINGLY HE LEFT HIS SERVANT ON THE ISLAND IN CHARGE OF HIS HORSES AND CAME ON BOARD THE DOBRYNA WITH ME
CAPTAIN SERVADAC WAS OF OPINION THAT THIS PECULIARITY AUGURED FAVORABLY FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF THE ERUPTION
WAS IT NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT THE TIME MIGHT COME WHEN THE INTERNAL FIRES OF GALLIA WOULD LOSE THEIR ACTIVITY AND THE STREAM OF LAVA WOULD CONSEQUENTLY CEASE TO FLOW
M
BUT THE SIGHT OF THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS LANDING WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIS EQUANIMITY AND DARTING FORWARD HE SEIZED HIS MASTER'S HAND AND COVERED IT WITH KISSES
THE TEMPERATURE BY NIGHT AS WELL AS BY DAY WAS QUITE ENDURABLE AND ON THE FOURTH AFTERNOON AFTER STARTING THANKS TO THE STRAIGHT COURSE WHICH THEIR COMPASS ENABLED THEM TO MAINTAIN THE ADVENTURERS FOUND THEMSELVES WITHIN A FEW MILES OF CEUTA
HERE IS THE SHIP YES REPLIED THE MAJOR
THE SUN SHONE BY DAY AND THE STARS BY NIGHT WITHOUT CAUSING ANY PERCEPTIBLE DIFFERENCE IN THE TEMPERATURE
BEN ZOOF HAD RENDERED HIS MASTER A LIKE SERVICE IN THE SOUDAN
THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HIS TARTAN WAS THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION MADE THE JEW GIVE WAY TO SUCH VEHEMENT EJACULATIONS OF ANXIETY THAT SERVADAC TURNED ROUND AND PEREMPTORILY ORDERED HIM TO DESIST FROM HIS CLAMOR
THREE TIMES INDEED--IN 1727 1779 AND 1792--FRANCE AND SPAIN HAVE DISPUTED OUR TITLE BUT ALWAYS TO NO PURPOSE
A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT QUITE ACCORDED WITH THE ABSENCE OF THE PUMICE-STONES OBSIDIANS AND OTHER MINERALS OF VOLCANIC ORIGIN WITH WHICH THE BASE OF A BURNING MOUNTAIN IS GENERALLY STREWN
LIEUTENANT PROCOPE PROCEEDED TO OBSERVE THAT HE BELIEVED THE PAPER MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS GENUINE AND ACCORDINGLY TAKING ITS STATEMENTS AS RELIABLE HE DEDUCED TWO IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS
THE VERY PEAK OF ETNA 11,000 FEET AS IT HAD REARED ITSELF ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA HAD VANISHED UTTERLY
NO STOP A MOMENT HE SAID AS BEN ZOOF WAS MOVING AWAY ON HIS ERRAND
R WHEN THE SCRUTINY OF THE OUTSIDE WAS FINISHED THE WAX WAS REMOVED AND THE COVER OPENED AND THE LIEUTENANT DREW OUT A SLIP OF RULED PAPER EVIDENTLY TORN FROM A COMMON NOTE-BOOK
IN ONE WAY OFF ON A COMET SHOWS A MARKED CONTRAST TO VERNE'S EARLIER BOOKS
YET FURTHER THE COMET SNATCHES FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF ITS TRAVELERS BOTH AIR AND WATER
NOT BEAR DOWN UPON IT AT ONCE ASKED THE COUNT IN SURPRISE
CAPTAIN SERVADAC HAD CAUTIONED THE PARTY TO COLLECT THEMSELVES BETIMES INTO ONE GROUP
FROM THAT DAY ROSETTE FOR SOME REASON AT PRESENT INCOMPREHENSIBLE QUITE ALTERED HIS BEHAVIOR TO ISAAC HAKKABUT A MAN FOR WHOM HE HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO EVINCED THE GREATEST REPUGNANCE AND CONTEMPT
ONCE LET AN ENGLISHMAN PLANT HIS NATIONAL STANDARD ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON AND IT WOULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE A COLONY WAS ESTABLISHED ROUND IT
BUT THIS SUPPOSITION DID NOT IN THE LEAST EXPLAIN THE OTHER PHYSICAL DISTURBANCES
HE HAD CALCULATED THE DIMINUTION OF HER TANGENTIAL SPEED
WE ARE ONLY LIVING IN THE CELLARS INSTEAD OF UPON THE GROUND FLOOR WE WILL TRY AND MAKE OURSELVES COMFORTABLE SAID THE ORDERLY
BUT SERVADAC CHECKED HIM AND CONTINUED IN SPANISH
SURELY NOW THEY WOULD FIND A DOCUMENT WHICH WOULD THROW SOME LIGHT UPON ALL THE MYSTERIES THAT HAD HAPPENED
HERE A LITTLE GIRL SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS OF AGE WITH RICH BROWN HAIR AND LUSTROUS DARK EYES BEAUTIFUL AS ONE OF MURILLO'S ANGELS WAS PEEPING SHYLY THROUGH THE BRANCHES
THE SKY PRESENTED A MOST SINGULAR APPEARANCE
MOREOVER SEVERAL PEOPLE FROM WIDELY SCATTERED PLACES ARE CARRIED OFF BY THE COMET AND RETURNED UNINJURED
IT WAS A MATTER OF DEBATE THAT NIGHT WHETHER THE PROFESSOR SHOULD BE INVITED TO JOIN THE PARTY
THEY HAVE PLENTY OF PROVISIONS
STOP THAT HOWLING BELSHAZZAR LET HIM ALONE BEN ZOOF
THE LAMP THAT HAD BEEN KINDLED AT THE MEMORIAL SHRINE OF A SAINT WAS NOW IN ALL PROBABILITY THE ONLY BEACON THAT THREW A LIGHT ACROSS THE WATERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND EVEN THIS ERE LONG MUST ITSELF EXPIRE
BOTH THE SCHOONER AND THE TARTAN WERE ENTIRELY DESTROYED
HAPPILY HOWEVER THERE WAS AT PRESENT NO SYMPTOM OF THE SUBSIDENCE OF THE LAVA'S STREAM
AND BEN ZOOF WHO HAD MOUNTED THE HIGHEST POINT OF VIEW ATTAINABLE COULD DISTINGUISH SEA AND NOTHING BUT SEA TO THE FARTHEST HORIZON
HOWEVER GREAT WAS THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATED GALLIA FROM THE SUN IT WAS AFTER ALL MANIFESTLY INSIGNIFICANT IN COMPARISON WITH THE REMOTENESS OF THE NEAREST OF THE FIXED STARS
IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO COME TO ANY OTHER CONCLUSION BUT THAT THE LAND BEFORE THEM CONTINENT OR ISLAND HAD BEEN UPHEAVED BY SUBTERRANEAN FORCES ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND THAT IT WAS MAINLY COMPOSED OF THE SAME METALLIC ELEMENT AS HAD CHARACTERIZED THE DUST SO FREQUENTLY UPLIFTED FROM THE BOTTOM
IT HAD BECOME CLEAR TO HIS MIND WHAT HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF THAT SECRET VISIT TO CEUTA WHICH HE HAD HEARD OF AS BEING MADE BY THE TWO ENGLISH OFFICERS
IN THE EVENING THE EXPLORERS ENCAMPED AS PREVIOUSLY IN A NOOK OF THE SHORE WHICH HERE ABRUPTLY TERMINATED THEIR NEW DOMAIN NOT FAR FROM WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED TO FIND THE IMPORTANT VILLAGE OF MEMOUNTURROY
SELFISH AND MOROSE HAKKABUT COULD NEVER BE INDUCED TO BE PRESENT AT THESE SOCIAL GATHERINGS
ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT TO BE QUESTIONED THAT A GENUINE DESIRE OF DOING AN ACT OF KINDNESS TO HIS FELLOW-CREATURES WAS A LEADING MOTIVE OF SERVADAC'S PROPOSED VISIT TO GIBRALTAR IT MUST BE OWNED THAT ANOTHER IDEA CONFIDED TO NOBODY LEAST OF ALL TO COUNT TIMASCHEFF HAD BEEN CONCEIVED IN THE BRAIN OF THE WORTHY GASCON
FRANCE SHOUT PROCOPE THE COUNT AND SERVADAC ALMOST IN A BREATH
I HAVE NO MONEY HE WAS PALE WITH FRIGHT AND HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS SAYING
HOW THEY HAD DISCOVERED NOTHING EXCEPT THE FRAGMENTS OF THE OLD CONTINENT AT TUNIS SARDINIA GIBRALTAR AND NOW AT FORMENTERA
JULY HAD NOW ARRIVED
WE SHALL NOT BE CLASSED WITH THEM OUR LACK OF INSTRUMENTS SAID THE COUNT IS MUCH TO BE DEPLORED
THE DOBRYNA NOW PUT ABOUT AND RESUMED HER EXPLORATIONS IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION
NOW GENTLEMEN SAID PROFESSOR ROSETTE WE ARE IN A POSITION TO COMPLETE OUR CALCULATION
IT IS VERY EVIDENT SAID THE LIEUTENANT THAT EVER SINCE THE 1ST OF JANUARY THE EARTH HAS BEEN MOVING IN A NEW ORBIT AND FROM SOME UNKNOWN CAUSE HAS DRAWN NEARER TO THE SUN NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT SAID SERVADAC
AND TRULY IF THEY COULD HAVE PAUSED TO STUDY IT THAT PANORAMA OF THE STATES OF EUROPE WHICH WAS OUTSTRETCHED BEFORE THEIR EYES WAS CONSPICUOUS FOR THE FANTASTIC RESEMBLANCES WITH WHICH NATURE ON THE ONE HAND AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ON THE OTHER HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM
THE COLONEL SIGNING TO HIS GUESTS TO FOLLOW LED THE WAY TO THE APARTMENT OCCUPIED JOINTLY BY HIMSELF AND THE MAJOR WHICH ALTHOUGH ONLY A KIND OF CASEMATE HOLLOWED IN THE ROCK NEVERTHELESS WORE A GENERAL AIR OF COMFORT
YOU SHALL ANSWER FOR YOUR CONDUCT BEFORE A COURT OF JUSTICE WHERE
BUT THE RADIANT ORB ENLARGED BY THE EFFECT OF REFRACTION ITS CIRCUMFERENCE SHARPLY DEFINED AGAINST THE SKY SANK ABRUPTLY AS THOUGH A TRAP HAD BEEN OPENED IN THE ICE FOR ITS RECEPTION
CHAPTER XXII
THE DAMAGE SUSTAINED BY THE ENGINE PROVED TO BE NOT VERY SERIOUS
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS UNDENIABLE THAT THERE WAS A STONE BUILDING SITUATED ON THE TOP OF THE ROCK AND THAT THIS BUILDING HAD MUCH THE CHARACTER OF AN ARABIAN MOSQUE
SERVADAC OBSERVED THE SUPERCILIOUS LOOK AND HALF ROSE TO HIS FEET BUT SMOTHERING HIS RESENTMENT TOOK HIS SEAT AGAIN WITHOUT SPEAKING
CHAPTER XIX
ON THE OTHER HAND NOT A SINGLE WORD ABOUT THEIR FORMER RIVALRY HAD EVER ESCAPED THEIR LIPS
THE TEMPERATURE HAS BEEN GRADUALLY DIMINISHING
INDEED WAS ALL HE SAID
ON BOARD THE WHALING-VESSELS AND IN THE ESTABLISHMENTS OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY SUCH LUXURIES AS SEPARATE CABINS OR SLEEPING-CHAMBERS ARE NEVER THOUGHT OF
TO BEN ZOOF THE LAST WEEK OF THE YEAR WAS FULL OF BUSTLE
WE CAN'T HAVE ANY DEAD WEIGHT HERE
IT WAS ABOUT A MONTH AFTER THE GREAT DISRUPTION THAT I WAS SAILING--MY ENGINE HAVING SUSTAINED SOME DAMAGE IN THE SHOCK--ALONG THE ALGERIAN COAST AND HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING WITH MY PREVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE CAPTAIN SERVADAC WHO WAS RESIDENT UPON THE ISLAND WITH HIS ORDERLY BEN ZOOF BEN WHO INQUIRED THE MAJOR
THE DISCOVERY WAS FATAL TO ALL FURTHER PROGRESS IN THE TRIANGULATION
YES FINE QUARTERS FOR TRADE
THE TASK HE HAD UNDERTAKEN DEMANDED THE UTMOST PATIENCE
WHAT AILS YOU NOTHING SIR ONLY THE NIGHTMARE CURSE THE FELLOW HE HAS QUITE INTERRUPTED ME EJACULATED THE CAPTAIN
BUT I CANNOT LET YOU INTO MY CABIN
A SKILLED GEOLOGIST WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASSIGN THEM THEIR PROPER SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION BUT NEITHER SERVADAC TIMASCHEFF NOR THE LIEUTENANT COULD PRETEND TO ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THEIR SPECIFIC CHARACTER
A JOLLY BATTLE-FIELD FOR COWARDS EXCLAIMED BEN ZOOF
ALL WAS DESOLATE AS THE SHORE THEY HAD QUITTED
AT TIMES HE WAS HEARD GIVING VENT TO HIS VEXATION
A VAGUE IDEA OF RUIN BEGAN TO TAKE POSSESSION OF HIS MIND
THE WESTERN EXTREMITY OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
LET US HOPE THAT THIS TIME HE HAS GIVEN US HIS NAME AND ADDRESS ALL CROWDED ROUND EAGER TO HEAR THE NEWS
THE CAPTAIN PERSISTED THAT AN ENTIRELY NEW ABODE MUST BE SOUGHT WHILE THE LIEUTENANT WAS EQUALLY BENT UPON DEVISING A METHOD OF SOME SORT BY WHICH THEIR PRESENT QUARTERS MIGHT BE RENDERED SUFFICIENTLY WARM
IT BELONGED TO AN AFRICAN SPECIES DISTINGUISHED BY A BLACK SPOTTED SKIN AND A BLACK LINE DOWN THE FRONT OF THE LEGS
IN SUCH EVENTS WE ARE AT THE DISPOSAL OF AN OVER-RULING PROVIDENCE
A FINE HAUL LIEUTENANT SAID THE CAPTAIN
IT IS THE TIME FOR SPECULATION THE VERY THING HAKKABUT THAT I AM ANXIOUS TO PREVENT
WHAT ALL MY MONEY WHICH I HAVE SAVED SO LONG AND TOILED FOR SO HARD IT CAN'T BE HELPED SAID THE CAPTAIN UNMOVED
AND AS THEY ALL KEPT APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING ABOVE THE BANK OF FOLIAGE THEIR GROTESQUE ATTITUDES COMBINED WITH THE PITIABLE COUNTENANCE OF THEIR HELPLESS VICTIM COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN RECALL MOST FORCIBLY THE STORY OF SANCHO PANZA TOSSED IN A BLANKET BY THE MERRY DRAPERS OF SEGOVIA
I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF THAT IS NOT THE SUN AND AS BEN ZOOF SPOKE HE POINTED DIRECTLY OVERHEAD TO WHERE A FAINT WHITE DISC WAS DIMLY VISIBLE THROUGH THE HAZE OF CLOUDS
ANOTHER SIXTY LEAGUES TO THE SOUTH AND THE DOBRYNA SIGHTED THE ENTRANCE OF THE STRAIT WHICH HAD AFFORDED HER SO PROVIDENTIAL A REFUGE FROM THE TEMPEST AND HAD CONDUCTED HER TO THE FRAGMENTARY RELIC OF GIBRALTAR
BORN ON THE HILL OF MONTMARTRE BETWEEN THE SOLFERINO TOWER AND THE MILL OF LA GALETTE BEN ZOOF HAD EVER POSSESSED THE MOST UNRESERVED ADMIRATION FOR HIS BIRTHPLACE
BACK AGAIN DOWN THE LADDER SCRAMBLED THE LITTLE PROFESSOR AND BEFORE THE JEW WAS AWARE OF HIS PRESENCE HE HAD SEIZED HIM BY THE TAIL OF HIS SLOUCHY OVERCOAT
THE JOURNEY WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT SPECIAL INCIDENT
AN ENIGMA FROM THE SEA LIEUTENANT PROCOPE HAD BEEN LEFT ON BOARD IN CHARGE OF THE DOBRYNA AND ON RESUMING THE VOYAGE IT WAS A TASK OF SOME DIFFICULTY TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT HAD JUST COME TO LIGHT
ENGLAND IS TOO RICH TO GRUDGE HER SOLDIERS ANY OF HER SOLDIERS DUE
BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE PROFESSOR WAS RIGHT IN ADOPTING THE SUPPOSITION OF ITS BEING PARABOLIC
HE CONTINUED PONDERING FOR A TIME AND AT LAST SAID SLOWLY AND DISTINCTLY BY MAKING A BALLOON SERVADAC'S HEART SANK
DURING THE TWENTY-SEVEN DAYS THAT SHE HAD BEEN ABSENT THE DOBRYNA HE CONJECTURED WOULD HAVE EXPLORED THE MEDITERRANEAN WOULD VERY PROBABLY HAVE VISITED SPAIN FRANCE OR ITALY AND ACCORDINGLY WOULD CONVEY TO GOURBI ISLAND SOME INTELLIGENCE FROM ONE OR OTHER OF THOSE COUNTRIES
ALL OF THEM TOO WOULD BE HAPPY IN THE CONFIDENCE THAT WHEN THE TIME SHOULD COME ENGLAND WOULD HAVE FULL MEED OF PRAISE TO AWARD TO THE GALLANT SOLDIERS WHO HAD ADHERED SO WELL AND SO MANFULLY TO THEIR POST
THE ROCKY COAST ITS METALLIC SURFACE REFLECTING THE GLOW OF THE DAZZLING LUMINARIES APPEARED LITERALLY STIPPLED WITH LIGHT WHILST THE SEA AS THOUGH SPATTERED WITH BURNING HAILSTONES SHONE WITH A PHOSPHORESCENCE THAT WAS PERFECTLY SPLENDID
THEY COULD BE UNDER NO MISAPPREHENSION AS TO THE DISTANCE THEY HAD POSITIVELY SAILED FROM GOURBI ISLAND TOWARDS THE EAST BEFORE THEIR FURTHER PROGRESS WAS ARRESTED BY THE UNKNOWN SHORE
IT TOOK MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR TO SETTLE ON A SUITABLE LANDING-PLACE
I DO NOT MEAN HE BEGAN TIMIDLY TO CAST THE LEAST IMPUTATION OF INACCURACY UPON ANY OF YOUR CALCULATIONS BUT WOULD YOU ALLOW ME MY DEAR PROFESSOR TO SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD REVISE YOUR ESTIMATE OF THE DURATION OF GALLIA'S PERIOD OF REVOLUTION
THOSE MINOR PLANETS ALL ARE KNOWN TO ROTATE IN A NARROW ZONE BETWEEN THE ORBITS OF MARS AND JUPITER
UNLESS SOME MEANS OF PROTECTION WERE SPEEDILY DEVISED DEATH SEEMED TO BE STARING THEM IN THE FACE
ON THE EARTH THE EARTH
NO PARTICLE OF IT STIRRED
THEY COULD ALREADY HEAR THE DULL RUMBLINGS THAT INDICATED THAT THEY WERE AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRAL FOCUS
MONEY AT A PREMIUM WHO'S THERE
IN THIS BAG ARE FORTY FIVE-FRANC PIECES--ALTOGETHER THEY WEIGH EXACTLY A KILOGRAMME
WHAT ELSE COULD THIS FRAGMENT BE BUT THE SOLE SURVIVING REMNANT OF SOME SUMPTUOUS MANSION THAT ONCE HAD STOOD ON THIS UNRIVALED SITE
WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR PAY JUST THIS SIR
AT THE PACE AT WHICH THEY WERE WALKING IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THAT THE CAPTAIN AND HIS ATTENDANT WOULD NOT TAKE LONG TO ACCOMPLISH THE THREE MILES THAT LAY BETWEEN THE GOURBI AND THE PLACE OF RENDEZVOUS
BE THAT AS IT MAY HE WAS DEVOTING ALL HIS ENERGIES TO THE COMPILATION OF HIS RONDO AND SUPREMELY DIFFICULT HE FOUND THE TASK
BUT HOWEVER GREAT WAS HIS DESIRE TO ASCERTAIN WHAT THIS DISCOVERY IMPLIED HIS CURIOSITY WAS NOT YET DESTINED TO BE GRATIFIED
BUT ALL IN VAIN
BUT ALL IN VAIN
A FEW MINUTES CARRIED THEM OVER ANOTHER MILE WHEN BEN ZOOF STOPPED AGAIN
BUT EXCUSE ME HE ADDED PRESENTLY
YES BY THE GOD OF ABRAHAM YOU SHALL PAY ME A JEW EXCLAIMED SERVADAC
MANY OF HIS BEST WORKS WERE HOWEVER STILL TO FOLLOW
WHO SHALL TELL WHETHER WE MAY NOT MEET WITH SOME MORE SURVIVORS FROM THE CATASTROPHE TO WHOM IT MIGHT BE IN OUR POWER TO AFFORD ASSISTANCE BEFORE WE GO INTO OUR WINTER QUARTERS GENEROUS AND ALTOGETHER UNSELFISH AS THIS SENTIMENT REALLY WAS IT WAS OBVIOUSLY TO THE GENERAL INTEREST THAT THEY SHOULD BECOME ACQUAINTED AND IF POSSIBLE ESTABLISH FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH ANY HUMAN INHABITANT WHO MIGHT BE SHARING THEIR OWN STRANGE DESTINY IN BEING ROLLED AWAY UPON A NEW PLANET INTO THE INFINITUDE OF SPACE
THE PARTY AT GIBRALTAR THEY ALL AGREED WOULD NOT LIKE THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A STREAM OF LAVA FOR THEIR SUPPLY OF HEAT
ALTHOUGH COUNT TIMASCHEFF SECRETLY SYMPATHIZED WITH SERVADAC HE HAD CAREFULLY REFRAINED FROM TAKING PART IN THE DISPUTE
INSTEAD OF A BOILER EXPOSED TO THE ACTION OF AN ANGRY FIRE THE CRATER RATHER RESEMBLED A BRIMMING BASIN OF WHICH THE CONTENTS WERE NOISELESSLY ESCAPING
END OF FIRST BOOK BOOK II
AND EVEN IF HE SHOULD BE DESTINED ONCE AGAIN TO TAKE HIS PLACE IN AN ASTRONOMICAL CONGRESS ON THE EARTH HE WOULD BE JUST AS INCAPABLE AS EVER OF DETERMINING WHETHER OR NO THEY OWED THEIR EXISTENCE TO THE EXTERNAL ACCUMULATION OF VAPOR OR TO SOME INTERNAL AGENCY
THAT WILL NOT SUIT US
ON THE 1ST OF SEPTEMBER THE DISTANCE BETWEEN GALLIA AND JUPITER WAS PRECISELY THE SAME AS THE MEAN DISTANCE BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE SUN
IT HAD NO FEATURE IN COMMON WITH THE MOON
PRESERVED MEAT ALE BRANDY--ALL WERE IN ABUNDANCE
A MARS
NO SHIP APPEARED UPON THE DESERT SEA
THE STONE HOSTELRY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME DEEP CLEFTS IN ITS WALLS HAD SUSTAINED LITTLE INJURY
DESTITUTE OF HUMAN INHABITANTS GOURBI ISLAND WAS NOW LEFT TO THE TENANCY OF SUCH BIRDS AND BEASTS AS HAD ESCAPED THE RECENT PROMISCUOUS SLAUGHTER
THE CREATURE HAD DARK ALMOST BLACK HAIR AND SMALL CURVED HORNS AND WAS A SPECIMEN OF THAT DOMESTIC BREED WHICH WITH CONSIDERABLE JUSTICE HAS GAINED FOR ITSELF THE TITLE OF THE POOR MAN'S COW SO FAR FROM BEING ALARMED AT THE PRESENCE OF STRANGERS THE GOAT RAN NIMBLY TOWARDS THEM AND THEN BY ITS MOVEMENTS AND PLAINTIVE CRIES SEEMED TO BE ENTICING THEM TO FOLLOW IT
AND A VERY SAFE DISTANCE TOO SAID BEN ZOOF WHEN HIS MASTER TOLD HIM THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH HE HAD ARRIVED
PREVIOUSLY TO SAIL FROM MALTA TO GIBRALTAR BY AN EASTWARD COURSE WOULD HAVE INVOLVED THE PASSAGE OF THE SUEZ CANAL THE RED SEA THE INDIAN OCEAN THE PACIFIC THE ATLANTIC
ON THE 16TH THE DISTANCE WAS FURTHER REDUCED TO 26,000,000 LEAGUES
BUT I HAVE BEEN TO LOOK AND I CANNOT FIND A PAIR ANYWHERE
THE RUSSIAN SAILORS EXHIBITED SOME OF THEIR NATIONAL DANCES WHICH GAINED CONSIDERABLE APPLAUSE EVEN ALTHOUGH THEY FOLLOWED UPON THE MARVELOUS FANDANGOS OF THE SPANIARDS
HIS ARRIVAL THERE WAS GENERALLY HAILED AS THE PRECURSOR OF A LITTLE SEASON OF EXCITEMENT
CHAPTER XVIII
CHAPTER XVIII
THE OLD FOOTMARKS WERE ALL AS DISTINCT AS ON THE DAY IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN IMPRINTED AND THE ONLY PORTION OF THE SHORE WHERE ANY CHANGE WAS APPARENT WAS IN THE LITTLE CREEK
WE MIGHT ALL HAVE BEEN CRUSHED TO DEATH OR THE COMET MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN ADHESION TO THE EARTH
THE FACULTY OF COLONIZATION SEEMS TO BE INDIGENOUS TO THE NATIVE CHARACTER
THE WORM-EATEN DOOR WAS BOLTED ON THE INSIDE
AS THE COMET APPROACHED THE CRITICAL POINT OF ITS CAREER IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THERE WAS AN UNACKNOWLEDGED CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALARM
BOTH THE HYPOTHESES THEY HAD FORMED IN SUCCESSION HAD NOW TO GIVE WAY BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE REAL TRUTH
WITH HIS WONTED DISTRUST OF ALL WITH WHOM HE CAME IN CONTACT HE REGARDED EVERY ARGUMENT THAT WAS URGED UPON HIM ONLY AS EVIDENCE OF A PLOT THAT HAD BEEN DEVISED TO DEPRIVE HIM OF HIS GOODS
HIS IDEA NOW WAS TO DRAW UP A REPORT OF HIS INVESTIGATIONS
WHATEVER IT WAS IT WAS AGREED THAT ITS TRUE CHARACTER MUST BE ASCERTAINED NOT ONLY TO GRATIFY THEIR OWN CURIOSITY BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL FUTURE NAVIGATORS
I HOPE SO SAID THE ORDERLY WITHOUT MOVING HIS EYE FROM THE DISTANT SPHERE
AND WHAT MAY YOUR LITTLE FORTUNE WEIGH INQUIRED THE CAPTAIN
BUT THE CAPTAIN WAS OUT OF HEARING
THE VOLUME WAS OPEN AND THE PAGE EXPOSED TO VIEW WAS THAT WHICH CONTAINED THE OFFICE FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE 25TH OF AUGUST
REGARDING THE TWO WAYFARERS WITH MANIFEST UNEASINESS THE BEAST TOOK UP ITS POSITION AT THE FOOT OF A ROCK MORE THAN THIRTY FEET IN HEIGHT
WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN EVERY HOUR GROWING MORE AND MORE BEWILDERED
THE THERMOMETER STOOD ON AN AVERAGE AT 8 DEGREES BELOW ZERO AND THE WATER IN THE CISTERN WAS COMPLETELY FROZEN
AROUND THESE THERE WAS STRETCHED OUT THE FULL EXTENT OF THE GALLIAN SEA WHICH APPARENTLY COMPRISED ABOUT ONE-HALF OF THE MEDITERRANEAN THE WHOLE BEING ENCOMPASSED BY A BARRIER LIKE A FRAMEWORK OF PRECIPITOUS CLIFFS OF AN ORIGIN AND A SUBSTANCE ALIKE UNKNOWN
BESIDES HE ADDED SMILING I EXPECT THAT GALLIA ALTHOUGH INVISIBLE JUST AT PRESENT TO THE NAKED EYE IS BEING CLOSELY WATCHED BY THE TELESCOPES OF OUR TERRESTRIAL FRIENDS AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE NEWSPAPERS AND SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS OF BOTH HEMISPHERES ARE FULL OF ACCOUNTS DETAILING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE NEW COMET TRUE ASSERTED THE COUNT
AND HOW MANY DAYS WILL MAKE A MONTH ASKED THE PROFESSOR
ITS SALIENT POINTS WERE ILLUMINED WITH NOVEL AND RADIANT TINTS AND THE SOLAR RAYS REFLECTED FROM ITS DISC GLOWED WITH A MINGLED SOFTNESS AND INTENSITY UPON GALLIA SO THAT NERINA HAD TO PALE HER BEAUTY
IT WAS DISTANT YET BUT THE GOAL WAS CHEERINGLY IN VIEW
BUT THE WHOLE PARTY WAS FAR TOO EAGER TO WAIT AND EXAMINE THESE REMNANTS OF THE ANCIENT SHORE
NOTHING WHATEVER
THEY WERE GLAD TO BE ON BOARD AGAIN THAT THEY MIGHT RESUME THEIR VOYAGE OF INVESTIGATION AND IN TWO HOURS WERE OUT OF SIGHT OF THE SOLE REMAINING FRAGMENT OF GIBRALTAR
AT PRESENT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE EVEN IF GALLIA'S ORBIT WERE REALLY ELLIPTIC WHEN SHE WOULD REACH HER APHELION AND IT WAS CONSEQUENTLY NECESSARY THAT THE GALLIANS FOR THE TIME BEING SHOULD RECKON ON NOTHING BEYOND THEIR ACTUAL AND PRESENT RESOURCES
HE COULD NO LONGER RESIST THE CONVICTION THAT HE WAS INDEED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF MILES AWAY FROM THE EARTH WHERE HE HAD CARRIED ON SO VARIED AND REMUNERATIVE A TRAFFIC
JUST STOP NOW AND THINK A MINUTE
A HUNDRED MILES OR SOMEWHAT OVER IN THAT DIRECTION AND IT WAS TO BE ANTICIPATED SHE WOULD COME IN SIGHT OF MALTA IF ONLY THAT ANCIENT ISLAND THE HERITAGE IN SUCCESSION OF PHOENICIANS CARTHAGINIANS SICILIANS ROMANS VANDALS GREEKS ARABIANS AND THE KNIGHTS OF RHODES SHOULD STILL BE UNDESTROYED
THE POSITION OF THE ASCENDING NODE OR THE POINT WHERE THE COMET CROSSED THE TERRESTRIAL ORBIT
IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR PROCEEDING IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION THEY HAD DESCENDED NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED FEET
EVERY HOPE DEPENDED UPON THE LAND AGAIN BECOMING PRODUCTIVE
IT WAS THE EXISTENCE OF SO GOOD A HARBOR AMIDST THE EXPOSED CLIFFS OF THIS COAST THAT HAD INDUCED THE OWNER OF THE DOBRYNA TO WINTER IN THESE PARTS AND FOR TWO MONTHS THE RUSSIAN STANDARD HAD BEEN SEEN FLOATING FROM HER YARD WHILST ON HER MAST-HEAD WAS HOISTED THE PENNANT OF THE FRENCH YACHT CLUB WITH THE DISTINCTIVE LETTERS M
I ONLY MEANT SILENCE SHOUTED SERVADAC
CHRISTMAS ARRIVED AND WAS MARKED BY APPROPRIATE RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE BY EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE JEW WHO MADE A POINT OF SECLUDING HIMSELF MORE OBSTINATELY THAN EVER IN THE GLOOMY RECESSES OF HIS RETREAT
THEY TURNED THE PAPER OVER AND OVER AND HANDED IT FROM ONE TO ANOTHER
THE MAJOR STOOD WAITING FOR HIS VISITOR TO SPEAK
BUT THE WIND DID NOT VEER AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE SCHOONER WAS HARDLY THREE CABLES DISTANCE FROM THE FATAL LAND
A SHIP
THE SPANIARDS WERE SUMMONED AND ISAAC ALTHOUGH HE COULD ONLY WITH RELUCTANCE TAKE HIS WISTFUL GAZE FROM HIS TARTAN OBEYED THE GOVERNOR'S ORDERS TO FOLLOW
THE HANSA WAS LYING OFF SHORE
NOR TO MINGLE WITH THE STAR CLUSTERS SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY OTHERS PARTIALLY RESOLVED
THE MODIFIED ROTATION OF THE COMET CAUSED IT TO BE DAYLIGHT AT THE TIME
THE RAIN CEASED AS IF BY A SPELL
AND IN ORDER TO FIND AN ANSWER HE PUSHED ASIDE THE BROKEN THATCH SO THAT HIS HEAD APPEARED ABOVE THE DEBRIS
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THAT MAN COULD DO
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO LETTING US HIRE IT THE JEW'S EYES TWINKLED WITH A SATISFACTION THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO CONCEAL
HOWEVER HAVING SOME SMALL PRIVATE MEANS HE DETERMINED ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT TO CARRY ON HIS RESEARCHES WITHOUT ANY OFFICIAL SALARY
THE SKETCHES OF MINES AND MINERS THEIR COURAGE AND THEIR DANGERS THEIR LIVES AND THEIR HOPES ARE CAREFULLY STUDIED
HAD HE ASCERTAINED THE TRUE CHARACTER OF HER ORBIT
IS THE LAW OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION THE LAW OF UNIVERSAL NONSENSE AND THE LITTLE MAN WOULD SEIZE HIS HEAD IN BOTH HIS HANDS AND TEAR AWAY AT THE SCANTY LOCKS WHICH HE COULD ILL AFFORD TO LOSE
WE WILL MAKE OUR WAY TO THE RIVER AND GET OVER INTO MOSTAGANEM SAID THE CAPTAIN
THESE RESOURCES WERE FIRST THE PROVISIONS OF THE DOBRYNA CONSISTING OF PRESERVED MEAT SUGAR WINE BRANDY AND OTHER STORES SUFFICIENT FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS
NEITHER CAN THEY BE UNAWARE OF THE PHYSICAL CHANGES THAT HAVE TRANSPIRED
HISTORY IS THUS STEREOTYPED IN SPACE
THE NEED FOR HASTE IN FORWARDING THEIR PREPARATIONS BECAME MORE AND MORE MANIFEST
TO WHICH BEN ZOOF REPLIED WITH THE UTMOST DIGNITY THAT HE WAS BORN AT MONTMARTRE WHICH WAS ALL THE SAME
EVEN SHIPS PASS UNINJURED THROUGH THIS REMARKABLE SOMERSAULT
THE FORMAL PRELIMINARIES OF ETIQUETTE BEING THUS COMPLETE THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY OBSTACLE TO A FREER INTERCOURSE
ITS MOUNTAINS ELEVEN MILES HIGH;--WERE ALL SUBJECTS OF OBSERVATION WORTHY OF THE MOST STUDIOUS REGARD
A ROYAL SALUTE THEN I TAKE YOUR BISHOP MAJOR SAID COLONEL MURPHY AS HE MADE A MOVE THAT HE HAD TAKEN SINCE THE PREVIOUS EVENING TO CONSIDER
ONLY SUCCEED IN PIERCING THROUGH THIS ROCK FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT YARDS AND THE LIEUTENANT DID NOT DOUBT THAT HIS WAY WOULD BE OPENED INTO THE OLD LAVA-COURSE BY FOLLOWING WHICH HE HOPED DESCENT WOULD BE EASY
ALL WAS IN VAIN
FLOC
IN A FEW MOMENTS SERVADAC APPROACHED AND THE JEW BEGAN TO OVERWHELM HIM WITH THE MOST OBSEQUIOUS EPITHETS
THERE WE SHALL OBTAIN THE WARMTH WHICH IS INDISPENSABLE TO OUR VERY EXISTENCE HIS TONE QUITE AS MUCH AS HIS WORDS RESTORED CONFIDENCE TO MANY OF HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE ALREADY YIELDING TO A FEELING OF DESPAIR
LARGER AND LARGER GREW THE ORIFICE
UNLESS SHE HAD SHIFTED VERY MUCH NEARER THE EARTH SHE COULD NEVER GIVE A LIGHT AS INTENSE AS THIS AS HE SPOKE THE SCREEN OF VAPOR WAS ILLUMINATED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS AS IT WERE BATHED IN TWILIGHT
THIS WOULD LEAVE 81,000,000 LEAGUES MORE TO BE TRAVERSED BEFORE REACHING THE APHELION OF THE 15TH OF JANUARY AFTER WHICH IT WOULD BEGIN ONCE MORE TO APPROACH THE SUN
THOUGH RIVALS THE TWO MEN REGARDED EACH OTHER WITH SINCERE RESPECT
IT WAS NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE SHELIF THAT A PORTION OF AFRICA ON THAT EVENTFUL NIGHT WAS TRANSFORMED INTO AN ISLAND WHICH ALONE SURVIVED
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE THEIR MEETING THAT THE TWO MEN HAD SHAKEN HANDS
AT A ROUGH GUESS THE VALUE COULD NOT BE MUCH UNDER POUNDS 5,000 STERLING
YOU MUST PERISH WITH COLD
DO YOU TAKE US FOR THIEVES ASKED SERVADAC IN TONES OF STERN DISPLEASURE
INCREDIBLE EJACULATED THE COLONEL
TO BE SURE HE HAS SAID BEN ZOOF
AT THIS SPOT THE SHORE THAT HITHERTO HAD BEEN RUNNING IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION TURNED ABRUPTLY TO THE NORTH BEING NO LONGER FORMED BY THE NATURAL BANK OF THE SHELIF BUT CONSISTING OF AN ABSOLUTELY NEW COAST-LINE
WAS IT TO BE CONJECTURED THAT A FRAGMENT OF THE EARTH HAD BEEN CHIPPED OFF BY THE COLLISION OF A COMET
AS IT ALTOGETHER TRANSCENDED THE POWERS OF THOSE ON BOARD TO ELUCIDATE THE ORIGIN OF THIS CATASTROPHE IT WAS FELT TO BE INCUMBENT ON THEM AT LEAST TO ASCERTAIN ITS EXTENT
THEY WERE AS BEN ZOOF REMARKED TOO MUCH BOILED TO BITE AT THE BEGINNING OF APRIL THE WEATHER CHANGED
BUT HIS CHIEF DELIGHT WAS TO CRITICIZE THE PUBLICATIONS OF OTHER ASTRONOMERS AND HE WAS NEVER BETTER PLEASED THAN WHEN HE DETECTED A FLAW IN THEIR RECKONINGS
TO THIS STRANGE CONGLOMERATION OF FRENCH ENGLISH ITALIAN AND LATIN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE ATTACHED
IT MUST BE SMALLER THAN THE REMAINING SPLINTER OF GIBRALTAR OR CEUTA
BEN ZOOF WAS ON THE POINT OF LAYING DOWN THE MONEY WHEN SERVADAC STOPPED HIM
YES INDEED SAID THE LIEUTENANT
I HOPE I HAVE NOT BECOME A NEGRO NO REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
DESPITE THE STRAIN PUT UPON HER ENGINE THE SCHOONER BARE OF CANVAS FOR NOT EVEN THE SMALLEST STAY-SAIL COULD HAVE WITHSTOOD THE VIOLENCE OF THE STORM WAS DRIFTING WITH TERRIFIC SPEED TOWARDS THE MENACING PRECIPICES WHICH WERE ONLY A
THUS IN PROPORTION AS GALLIA RECEDED FROM THE SUN SO DID THE RATE OF SPEED DIMINISH BY WHICH SHE TRAVELED ALONG HER ORBIT
WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION HERE IS ONLY ONE-SEVENTH OF WHAT IT IS UPON THE EARTH AND SHALL CONSEQUENTLY HAVE TO MULTIPLY THE APPARENT WEIGHT OF OUR CUBE BY SEVEN IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN ITS PROPER WEIGHT
VILLAIN THE PROFESSOR REITERATED AND CONTINUED TO SHAKE THE JEW FURIOUSLY
AND ALTHOUGH THE MEAN DENSITY IS ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THAT OF THE EARTH AND ONLY A THIRD OF THAT OF WATER WHENCE IT HAS BEEN SUPPOSED THAT THE SUPERFICIES OF JUPITER IS LIQUID YET HIS OTHER PROPORTIONS WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO WARRANT THE APPREHENSION THAT IMPORTANT DISTURBANCES MIGHT RESULT FROM HIS PROXIMITY
RUSSIAN THEY GASPED
BUT SERVADAC WITHOUT HEEDING HIS COMPLAININGS WENT ON
DO PLEASE LET ME IN OH IT IS YOU OLD ASHTAROTH IS IT
HOW FAR OFF DO YOU SUPPOSE IT IS IT MUST BE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY LEAGUES AWAY SAID THE LIEUTENANT THOUGHTFULLY
OUR PRESENT ABODE IS BUT AN INSIGNIFICANT FRAGMENT THAT IS LEFT
YOU ARE TOO GOOD TO BE SPOILED AND WHEN I AM WITH YOU YOU MAKE ME GOOD TOO SAID PABLO GRAVELY
ON THE WHOLE TIME PASSED INDIFFERENTLY WELL
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT SAID SERVADAC AFTER A BRIEF INTERVAL
THINKING HE COULD TURN THE WRANGLING TO SOME GOOD ACCOUNT SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE INFORMATION HE WAS SO ANXIOUSLY SEEKING THE CAPTAIN PRETENDED TO ESPOUSE THE VIEWS OF HIS ORDERLY
OH I THINK WE MUST INDULGE THE HOPE THAT THIS CATASTROPHE HAS NOT EXTENDED FAR
A LONG TRAIL OF SMOKE BETOKENED HER TO BE A STEAMER
THEY WERE PROUD OF THEIR NATIONALITY AND EXHIBITED A MANIFEST DISLIKE VERGING UPON CONTEMPT OF EVERYTHING FOREIGN
THE FEAR OF BEING TO A CERTAINTY FROZEN TO DEATH IF THEY REMAINED WHERE THEY WERE WAS A STIMULUS THAT MADE EVERYONE PUT FORTH ALL HIS ENERGIES
THE TWO CHILDREN BLITHE AS BIRDS FLITTED ABOUT NOW SINGLY NOW ARM-IN-ARM NOW JOINING THE CAPTAIN'S PARTY NOW MAKING A SHORT PEREGRINATION BY THEMSELVES BUT ALWAYS FULL OF LIFE AND SPIRIT
IT WAS THE MORNING OF THE 21ST OF FEBRUARY
YOU ARE QUITE CORRECT IT IS THE 26TH OF MARCH STRANGE MUTTERED SERVADAC
THE VENTURE MADE WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SUDDEN AND COMPLETE DISRUPTION SERVADAC AND HIS PEOPLE HARDLY DARED TO THINK
OF THE SATELLITES LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WENT ON TO SAY THAT ONE IS RATHER SMALLER THAN OUR OWN MOON
THE CALAMITY OF THE ERUPTION BREAKING OUT SUDDENLY AGAIN AND TAKING US BY SURPRISE HEAVENS CRIED THE CAPTAIN WE WILL NOT THINK OF THAT THE OUTBREAK MAY HAPPEN AGAIN SAID THE LIEUTENANT CALMLY
THE GAME THAT HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED BY CAPTAIN SERVADAC'S FORMER VISIT WAS NOT YET CONCLUDED
I DO NOT COMPREHEND YOU
BUT WE MAY FEEL PRETTY CERTAIN OF ONE THING
HOW SHOULD I WEIGH MY MERCHANDISE WITHOUT MY STEELYARD--MY SOLITARY STEELYARD SO DELICATE AND SO CORRECT THE ORDERLY WONDERED HOW HIS MASTER COULD REFRAIN FROM STRANGLING THE OLD MISER UPON THE SPOT
NOT A GALLIAN TWELVEMONTH EXCLAIMED ROSETTE
NOT ONLY DID THE STRUCTURE OF THE VESSELS MAKE THEM UTTERLY INSUFFICIENT TO GIVE SUBSTANTIAL SHELTER BUT THEY WERE TOTALLY UNFITTED TO BE TRUSTED AS TO THEIR STABILITY WHEN EXPOSED TO THE ENORMOUS PRESSURE OF THE ACCUMULATED ICE
IF SO GALLIA MUST NOW BE A HUNDRED MILLIONS OF LEAGUES FROM THE SUN NEARLY THREE TIMES THE DISTANCE OF THE EARTH AT THE REMOTEST SECTION OF HER ORBIT
RIGHT AHEAD WAS A NARROW OPENING IN THE SOLID ROCK
THE HANDWRITING CORRESPONDED WITH THAT OF THE PAPERS ALREADY RECEIVED
CHAPTER XXIII
BY THE EXPANSIVE ACTION OF THE INNER HEAT GALLIA LIKE GAMBART'S COMET HAD BEEN SEVERED IN TWAIN
AND ARE WE TO BE CARRIED ON FAR AND AWAY INTO REMOTE DISTANCE AND NEVER NEVER TO RETURN I DID NOT SAY AN HYPERBOLA AND IS IT NOT IT IS NOT THEN IT MUST BE AN ELLIPSE YES AND DOES ITS PLANE COINCIDE WITH THE PLANE OF THE EARTH YES THEN IT MUST BE A PERIODIC COMET IT IS SERVADAC INVOLUNTARILY RAISED A RINGING SHOUT OF JOY THAT ECHOED AGAIN ALONG THE GALLERY
NONSENSE MAN CRIED SERVADAC
THAT ON THE NIGHT OF THE 31ST OF DECEMBER A COMET CROSSING THE ECLIPTIC HAD COME INTO COLLISION WITH THE EARTH AND THAT THE VIOLENCE OF THE SHOCK HAD SEPARATED A HUGE FRAGMENT FROM THE GLOBE WHICH FRAGMENT FROM THAT DATE HAD BEEN TRAVERSING THE REMOTE INTER-PLANETARY REGIONS
OR PERHAPS THE ALGERIAN COAST HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED BEYOND THE EQUATOR INTO THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
IT WAS A PROTRACTED GAME
AND TO WHOM HE ADDED MAY I HAVE THE HONOR OF SPEAKING TO CAPTAIN SERVADAC THE GOVERNOR GENERAL OF GALLIA INDEED SAID THE MAJOR WITH A SUPERCILIOUS LOOK
SO FAR FROM THERE BEING ANY LIKELIHOOD OF THE FIRE BEING EXTINGUISHED BY THE VEHEMENCE OF THE CURRENT OF AIR THE HURRICANE SEEMED RATHER TO ACT AS A VENTILATOR WHICH FANNED THE FLAME INTO GREATER ACTIVITY AND THE UTMOST CARE WAS NECESSARY TO AVOID BEING BURNT BY THE FRAGMENTS OF LAVA THAT WERE DRIFTED INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE GROTTO
THE DISTANCE WAS SOMEWHERE ABOUT 240 MILES
THEY NO DOUBT HAD HAD ABUNDANCE OF FUEL AS WELL AS FOOD
HE NOTICED TOO THAT THEY DID NOT FALL PERPENDICULARLY BUT SEEMED TO SLIDE ALONG FROM WHICH HE INFERRED THAT THE SIDES OF THE CRATER WERE SLOPING
IT WILL PROVIDE US ALL THE WARMTH WE NEED
WITH AS MUCH TACT AND CAUTION AS HE COULD LIEUTENANT PROCOPE ENDEAVORED TO INTIMATE THE GENERAL DESIRE FOR SOME INFORMATION ON THIS POINT
TWENTY-SEVEN MINUTES PAST TWO AND GALLIA IS ONLY 72,000 MILES FROM THE TERRESTRIAL SPHERE
I MUST HAVE THEM THE CAPTAIN AND HIS FRIENDS WHO HAD RETURNED TO THE CABIN LOOKED ON WITH MINGLED AMUSEMENT AND BEWILDERMENT
HE ONLY KNEW THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE INTERVIEW NEGRETE CAME TO HIM AND ORDERED HIM TO SET SAIL AT ONCE FOR THE NEAREST POINT OF MOROCCO
HIS VOLUME IS 1,387 TIMES AND HIS MASS 300 TIMES GREATER
WOULD NOT ANOTHER EXPLORING EXPEDITION POSSIBLY RESULT IN THE DISCOVERY OF A VEIN OF COAL OR OTHER COMBUSTIBLE MATTER WHICH COULD BE TURNED TO ACCOUNT IN WARMING SOME ERECTION WHICH THEY MIGHT HOPE TO PUT UP
IT WAS CERTAIN THAT ERE LONG THE VERY MERCURY AND SPIRIT IN THE THERMOMETERS WOULD BE CONGEALED
LET ME IN
ON THE 15TH LOUD CRIES WERE SUDDENLY HEARD ISSUING FROM THE MOUTH OF THE PRINCIPAL GALLERY
AND WHEN DAYLIGHT APPEARS--IF IT EVER DOES APPEAR--WE WILL EXPLORE THE COAST TO THE WEST AND SOUTH AND RETURN TO THE GOURBI
THAT ON THE 10TH OF JANUARY IT CROSSED THE ORBIT OF VENUS
NO IMMEDIATE HURRY
THE ASTRONOMER CORRECT IN HIS PROGNOSTICATIONS OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE MOST PROUD AND CONTENTED OF PHILOSOPHERS
THE SCHOONER WAS DEXTEROUSLY PUT ABOUT AND ALL WAS EAGER IMPATIENCE UNTIL THE SUPPOSED BOTTLE WAS HAULED ON DECK
THE CROPS THAT WERE NOW READY FOR THE HARVEST AND THE FLOCKS AND HERDS SCATTERED OVER THE ISLAND WOULD FORM AN AMPLE RESERVE
NOTWITHSTANDING THEREFORE THAT THE SUN HAD RISEN AND SET TWELVE TIMES SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE NEW YEAR HE PERSISTED IN CALLING THE FOLLOWING DAY THE 6TH OF JANUARY
IT GAVE A FALSE RESULT
ON CONSULTING THEIR INSTRUMENTS THEY FOUND THAT THEY MUST HAVE TRAVELED CLOSE UPON A HUNDRED LEAGUES SINCE THEY STARTED AND THEY RESOLVED TO SLACKEN THEIR SPEED
THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY ONE OF THESE CONTINGENCIES WOULD BE FATAL TO THEIR HOPES OF REUNION WITH THE GLOBE FROM WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SO STRANGELY SEVERED
THE PROSPECT IT MUST BE OWNED WAS NOT INVITING
THE POLE-STAR 282 MILLIONS OF MILLIONS
MULTIPLY THAT BY SEVEN
SO IRRESISTIBLE WAS THIS GRADUAL PROCESS OF ELEVATION SO UTTERLY DEFYING ALL HUMAN POWER TO ARREST THAT THE LIEUTENANT BEGAN TO FEEL VERY ANXIOUS AS TO THE SAFETY OF HIS YACHT
THE CAREER OF THE COMET WAS EVER A MYSTERY WHICH NEITHER SERVADAC NOR HIS ORDERLY COULD ELIMINATE FROM THE REGIONS OF DOUBT
HEAVENS BY ALL THAT'S GOOD EXCLAIMED BOTH OFFICERS IN ONE BREATH AS STANDING OPEN-MOUTHED THEY HARDLY KNEW WHETHER THEY WERE TO BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE OF THEIR OWN SENSES
ALTHOUGH THE LAVA FROM SOME UNKNOWN CAUSE HAD CEASED TO RISE IN THE CRATER YET PLAINLY IT EXISTED SOMEWHERE IN AN INCANDESCENT STATE AND WAS STILL TRANSMITTING CONSIDERABLE HEAT TO INFERIOR STRATA
ALL WERE AWARE THAT THEIR LAST MOMENT HAD ARRIVED
HERE AT LEAST IS ONE NICE LITTLE INHABITANT OF GALLIA SAID CAPTAIN SERVADAC AS HE CARESSED THE CHILD AND CONDUCTED HER TO THE BOAT
I AM COME TO BUY YOUR GOODS
I HOPE WE ARE NOT TOO LATE AGAIN THEY WENT ON
THE FIRST PERSONS THAT SERVADAC RECOGNIZED WERE THE TWO FRIENDS THAT HE HAD INVITED TO BE HIS SECONDS IN THE DUEL TWO YEARS AGO THE COLONEL OF THE 2ND FUSILIERS AND THE CAPTAIN OF THE 8TH ARTILLERY
IF THE SITUATION WERE REPRODUCED IN ACTUALITY IF EVER A COMET SHOULD COME INTO COLLISION WITH THE EARTH WE CAN CONCEIVE TWO SCIENTIFICALLY POSSIBLE RESULTS
A SPANIARD WOULD RATTLE HIS CASTANETS AT THE CANNON'S MOUTH BUT WHAT IS THE MEANING OF IT ALL ASKED THE CAPTAIN MORE PUZZLED THAN BEFORE
A MOST WONDERFUL EVENT HAS CUT US OFF FROM SPAIN FROM FRANCE FROM ITALY FROM EVERY COUNTRY OF EUROPE
NOT INAPTLY MIGHT THE SCENE BE COMPARED TO THE CELEBRATED GROTTO OF THE WINDS AT THE REAR OF THE CENTRAL FALL OF NIAGARA ONLY WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT HERE INSTEAD OF A CURTAIN OF RUSHING WATER IT WAS A CURTAIN OF ROARING FLAME THAT HUNG BEFORE THE CAVERN'S MOUTH
JOSEPH THE PROFESSOR DID NOT OPEN HIS EYES AND APPEARED TO BE SLUMBERING ON BUT VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS CALLED OUT AGAIN JOSEPH
I BEG YOUR PARDON
THE SKY HAD ASSUMED A SINGULAR TINT AND WAS SOON COVERED WITH LOWERING CLOUDS THAT COMPLETELY HID THE SUN
I HAVE FOLLOWED THE PLAN OF EXPLAINING ALL I COULD TO MY MEN ON BOARD THE DOBRYNA AND NO INCONVENIENCE HAS ARISEN WELL THEN SO LET IT BE SAID THE CAPTAIN
THE ISLAND HAD ALL THE APPEARANCE OF BEING DESERTED NOR DID A CANNON-SHOT FIRED FROM THE SCHOONER HAVE THE EFFECT OF BRINGING ANY RESIDENT TO THE SHORE
AN IMPOSTURE SHOUTED SERVADAC AS HE STAMPED WITH RAGE
HAVE YOU NO FATHER NOR MOTHER ASKED PABLO ONE DAY
HE WAS SOON CONVEYED TO THE YAWL
THOSE WHO ARE CHILLY ARE WELCOME TO GO AS MUCH LOWER AS THEY LIKE
OH YES WE WILL BE HAPPY HERE REJOINED THE CHILD
TEN FRANCS A POUND YOU KNOW THE JEW HESITATED
FOR THE OUTWARD JOURNEY THE WIND WAS AS FAVORABLE AS COULD BE DESIRED
AND THEY LAY DOWN NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AND AWOKE TO THEIR AVOCATIONS MORNING AFTER MORNING JUST AS IF NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY HAD OCCURRED
CONSUMMATE RASCAL
THAT SATELLITE WAS A PART OF GALLIA ITSELF
HIS UNCOMELY FIGURE AND REPULSIVE COUNTENANCE WAS A PERPETUAL BUGBEAR
HE WOULD HAVE SCREAMED LIKE A PEACOCK
IT PROVED TO BE A FRAGMENT OF DIS-COLORED MARBLE ON WHICH SEVERAL LETTERS WERE INSCRIBED OF WHICH THE ONLY PART AT ALL DECIPHERABLE WAS THE SYLLABLE VIL VIL--VILLA HE CRIED OUT IN HIS EXCITEMENT DROPPING THE MARBLE WHICH WAS BROKEN INTO ATOMS BY THE FALL
NO DOUBT SHE WILL ANSWERED THE OTHER
CHAPTER III
CHAPTER III
THERE YOU ARE
THE SEA WAS ROLLING OVER THE SOUTHERN EXTENT OF THE PENINSULA SO THAT THE YACHT ADVANCED TO THE LATITUDE OF SEVILLE BEFORE IT SIGHTED ANY LAND AT ALL AND THEN NOT SHORES SUCH AS THE SHORES OF ANDALUSIA BUT A BLUFF AND PRECIPITOUS CLIFF IN ITS GEOLOGICAL FEATURES RESEMBLING EXACTLY THE STERN AND BARREN ROCK THAT SHE HAD COASTED BEYOND THE SITE OF MALTA
I DO NOT INTEND TO USE ANY OTHER WAS THE PROFESSOR'S BLUFF REPLY
IN THIS CASE HOWEVER IT WAS TECHNICAL IGNORANCE RATHER THAN ANY LACK OF INTELLIGENCE THAT JUSTIFIED THE SELECTION OF THE ORDERLY FOR THIS SPECIAL ATTENTION
IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN TEN WEEKS TO THE 15TH OF JANUARY WHEN THE COMET WOULD BEGIN TO RE-APPROACH THE SUN
I HAVE NEITHER
THE MOVEMENT SET HIM THINKING
TO PLANT THE TRICOLOR UPON IT IN THE NAME OF FRANCE WAS NOW THE CHERISHED WISH OF SERVADAC'S HEART
ALMOST WITHIN A MINUTE BEN ZOOF WAS SEEN RUNNING GUN IN HAND TOWARDS THE SHORE
HOWEVER RELUCTANTLY BEN ZOOF OBEYED
GALLIA HAD ITS DRAWBACKS BUT IT HAD SOME COMPENSATING ADVANTAGES
THE BIT OF STRAND WAS ONLY A FEW SQUARE YARDS IN AREA QUITE A NARROW STRIP
HE TRIED TO COMMUNICATE THE FACT THAT PARIS FRANCE EUROPE NAY THE WHOLE WORLD WAS MORE THAN EIGHTY MILLIONS OF LEAGUES AWAY FROM GOURBI ISLAND
WE HAVE ONLY COME TO KNOW WHETHER YOU CAN LEND US A STEELYARD SO FAR FROM SHOWING ANY SYMPTOM OF RELIEF THE OLD MISER EXCLAIMED WITH A STARE OF ASTONISHMENT AS IF HE HAD BEEN ASKED FOR SOME THOUSAND FRANCS
NO I AM NOT MISTAKEN HE ADDED
OF TELLURIUM AND 30 PER CENT
NOTHING OF THE SORT
PINCH ME HARD
TO SKATE SIXTY OR SEVENTY MILES A DAY WOULD BE NOTHING HE SAID TO A PRACTICAL SKATER LIKE HIMSELF
EVER AND AGAIN SOMETIMES IN A TONE OF UNEASINESS AND SOMETIMES WITH THE EXPRESSION OF POSITIVE ANGER THE NAME OF GALLIA ESCAPED HIS LIPS AS THOUGH HE WERE DREAMING THAT HIS CLAIM TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE COMET WAS BEING CONTESTED OR DENIED
NO ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE TO REBUILD THE GOURBI BUT THE CAPTAIN AND BEN ZOOF MANAGED TO MAKE UP QUARTERS SUFFICIENTLY COMFORTABLE IN THE PRINCIPAL APARTMENT OF THE ADJOINING STRUCTURE WHERE THE STONE WALLS THAT AT FIRST AFFORDED A REFUGE FROM THE TORRENTS OF RAIN NOW FORMED AN EQUALLY ACCEPTABLE SHELTER FROM THE BURNING SUN
PERHAPS AFTER ALL I AM RACKING MY BRAIN OVER SOMETHING THAT IS QUITE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF NATURE BUT REASON AS HE MIGHT THE MYSTERIES OF THE HEAVENS STILL REMAINED IMPENETRABLE
BUT ISN'T THERE ANOTHER THING TO BE DONE SAID BEN ZOOF
HE WILL SOON COME TO HIS SENSES SAID SERVADAC QUIETLY
AND THEY COULD ONLY SPECULATE AFRESH AS TO WHETHER THE AUTHOR OF THE RIDDLES WAS DWELLING UPON SOME SOLITARY ISLAND OR LIKE THEMSELVES WAS NAVIGATING THE WATERS OF THE NEW MEDITERRANEAN
OUTRUNNING EVEN BEN ZOOF HE HURRIED TO THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS LITTLE PLAYMATE AND DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS BEING ATTACKED BY HALF A DOZEN GREAT SEA-GULLS AND ONLY AFTER RECEIVING SOME SEVERE BLOWS FROM THEIR BEAKS COULD HE SUCCEED BY MEANS OF A STOUT CUDGEL IN DRIVING THEM AWAY
THEY HAVE BEEN HOARDED INSTEAD OF CIRCULATED
EVERYTHING WAS INCOMPREHENSIBLE
IF IT IS WORTH TWENTY FRANCS I WILL LEAVE A DEPOSIT OF A HUNDRED
CLIMBING UP TO THIS ORIFICE WHICH WAS MORE THAN SIXTY FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA THEY ASCERTAINED THAT IT OPENED INTO A LONG DARK GALLERY
FOR HOWEVER LIKELY IT MIGHT BE THAT A MASS OF THE EARTH ON BEING DETACHED WOULD BE ECCENTRIC IN ITS MOVEMENTS THERE WAS NO PROBABLE REASON TO BE ALLEGED WHY THE MATERIAL OF ITS SUBSTANCE SHOULD UNDERGO SO COMPLETE A CHANGE
THEIR PROXIMITY TO VENUS HAD BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BEYOND A DOUBT THAT PLANET HAS NO MOON OR SATELLITE SUCH AS CASSINI SHORT MONTAIGNE OF LIMOGES MONTBARRON AND SOME OTHER ASTRONOMERS HAVE IMAGINED TO EXIST
IN MY LITTLE BLACK HOLE I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT MY COFFEE OF COURSE YOU CANNOT AGREED THE PROFESSOR
IT IS ALMOST TIME FOR US TO START TO START
SOME OTHER RESORT MUST ASSUREDLY BE SOON FOUND OR THEY MUST PERISH
AND WHAT WAS QUITE AN UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR SEVERAL HEAVY STORMS BROKE OVER THE ISLAND
WHENCE CAME IT THAT THE MEDITERRANEAN ONE INSTANT EMPTIED OF ITS WATERS WAS THE NEXT FLOODED WITH A FOAMING SURGE
COME AND SHOW THE GOVERNOR PROPER RESPECT WHEN HE GIVES YOU THE HONOR OF HIS COMPANY CRIED BEN ZOOF WHO BY THIS TIME HAD CLAMBERED ONTO THE DECK
WHILST AS TO THE YAWL WHICH TRANSFORMED INTO A SLEDGE HAD PERFORMED SO SUCCESSFUL A TRIP TO FORMENTERA THE ABSENCE OF WIND WOULD MAKE THAT QUITE UNAVAILABLE
GALLIA IS MY COMET I DENY IT SAID SERVADAC
BY THE 14TH THE BALLOON WAS FINISHED AND CAREFULLY SEWN AND WELL VARNISHED AS IT HAD BEEN IT WAS REALLY A VERY SUBSTANTIAL STRUCTURE
HE HOPED THAT THEY WOULD FOLLOW ANY RISE IN THE LEVEL OF THE ICE-FIELD AND WHEN THE THAW SHOULD COME THAT THEY WOULD EASILY REGAIN THEIR PROPER WATER-LINE
A BRISK BREEZE TENDED TO INCREASE THE KEENNESS OF THE TEMPERATURE THE THERMOMETER BEING ON AN AVERAGE ABOUT TWO DEGREES BELOW ZERO
DO YOU THINK I CANNOT SEE AND PEERING DOWN INTO THE DRAWER WHICH THE JEW WAS VAINLY TRYING TO CLOSE HE CRIED HEAPS OF MONEY
BEN ZOOF IN PARTICULAR ROUSED HIMSELF WITH REDOUBLED VIGOR LIKE A GIANT REFRESHED FROM HIS SLUMBERS
IT NEED HARDLY BE SAID THAT THE CONVERSATION HAD BEEN CARRIED ON IN FRENCH A LANGUAGE WHICH IS GENERALLY KNOWN BOTH BY RUSSIANS AND ENGLISHMEN--A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IS PROBABLY IN SOME MEASURE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE REFUSAL OF FRENCHMEN TO LEARN EITHER RUSSIAN OR ENGLISH
TEN MINUTES LATER AND THEY ARE ONLY 36,000 MILES APART
OFTEN AND OFTEN HAD ISAAC GLOATED IN HIS SOLITUDE OVER THE PROSPECT OF FIRST SELLING A PORTION OF HIS MERCHANDISE FOR ALL THE GOLD AND SILVER IN THE COLONY
ITS GLACIAL AND ITS TORRID ZONES WHICH ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT INCLINATION OF THE AXIS ARE SCARCELY SEPARABLE
BUT PARDON ME IF I SUBMIT TO YOU A FEW CONSIDERATIONS WHICH TO MY MIND ARE VERY IMPORTANT
THE RUSSIAN AND THE ENGLISHMAN MUTUALLY EXCHANGED THE STIFFEST OF BOWS
UNABLE TO GET THE LAST WORD THE PROFESSOR WAS ABOUT TO RETIRE WHEN SERVADAC DETAINED HIM
HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS REMARKABLY DEVELOPED AND HIS BODY MIGHT NOT INAPTLY BE COMPARED TO ONE OF THE RHUMKORFF'S BOBBINS OF WHICH THE THREAD SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS IN LENGTH IS PERMEATED THROUGHOUT BY ELECTRIC FLUID
AT THE BEGINNING OF JUNE THE GENERAL TORPOR APPEARED SLIGHTLY TO RELAX ITS HOLD UPON ITS VICTIMS
FOR A FEW SECONDS HE STOOD MOTIONLESS HIS EYES FIXED AS IF OBEYING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF A DRILL SERGEANT ON A POINT SOME FIFTEEN YARDS DISTANT HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE INDICATING SUBMISSION AND RESPECT
FROM OCCASIONAL NEWSPAPERS WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED HE HAD LEARNT THAT FOGS DENSE AS EVER CONTINUED TO ENVELOP BOTH HEMISPHERES SO THAT HE WAS ASSURED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE COMET WAS UTTERLY UNKNOWN ELSEWHERE
ISN'T SHE SPLIT IN HALF
THE TEMPERATURE OF THE HALL NOW ENTIRELY EXPOSED TO THE OUTER AIR WAS RAPIDLY FALLING AND WOULD QUICKLY BECOME UNENDURABLE
HIS DAYS THEN ARE SHORTER THAN OURS INTERRUPTED THE CAPTAIN
THE VOLCANO CONTINUED ITS REGULAR AND UNCHANGING DISCHARGE AND SERVADAC EVER SANGUINE DECLARED THAT IT WAS USELESS TO GIVE THEMSELVES ANY ANXIETY UPON THE MATTER
IN THE SAME YEAR WITH OFF ON A COMET 1877 WAS PUBLISHED ALSO THE TALE VARIOUSLY NAMED AND TRANSLATED AS THE BLACK INDIES THE UNDERGROUND CITY AND THE CHILD OF THE CAVERN THIS STORY LIKE ROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS WAS FIRST ISSUED IN FEUILLETON BY THE NOTED PARIS NEWSPAPER LE TEMPS ITS SUCCESS DID NOT EQUAL THAT OF ITS PREDECESSOR IN THIS STYLE
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO-DAY ASKED THE JEW
WHAT WOULD NOW TRANSPIRE
HENCE HIS AGITATION AND BEWILDERMENT
BUT ALL WERE FAR TOO DISHEARTENED AND DISTRESSED TO CARE TO BANTER HIM UPON THE SUBJECT ON WHICH HE WAS SO SENSITIVE
THE FIRST BUSINESS WAS TO ACCOMMODATE THE BUILDING ADJACENT TO THE GOURBI TO THE WANTS OF THE LITTLE COLONY
IN ANOTHER WAS A TRESTLE-BOARD WHICH SERVED AS A BED
INSTEAD OF 100 DEGREES THE INSTRUMENT REGISTERED ONLY 66 DEGREES
ONCE FOR ALL I TELL YOU NOW YOU HAVE LEFT YOURSELF BARELY TIME ENOUGH TO MAKE YOUR ESCAPE TO YONDER MOUNTAIN GOD AND MAHOMET HAVE MERCY ON ME MUTTERED THE JEW WHOSE CREED FREQUENTLY ASSUMED A VERY AMBIGUOUS CHARACTER
THEY DID NOT EXCHANGE A WORD BUT EACH WAS CONSCIOUS OF AN UNUSUAL BUOYANCY WHICH APPEARED TO LIFT UP THEIR BODIES AND GIVE AS IT WERE WINGS TO THEIR FEET
THE THIRD 7 DAYS 3 HOURS 42 MINUTES
THEY HAVE ALREADY OCCUPIED IT AND ESTABLISHED THEIR COMMUNICATIONS SAID SERVADAC
BEN ZOOF WHO WAS UNACCUSTOMED TO SO BRIEF A PERIOD OF REPOSE WAS STILL SLUMBERING SOUNDLY
HERE I AM THE REPRESENTATIVE OF MY COUNTRY AND HERE ON NEUTRAL GROUND NEUTRAL GROUND OBJECTED COLONEL MURPHY
DYNAMITE ALONE COULD SUFFICE TO REND IT
YOU WILL FIND OUT SOME DAY ANSWERED BEN ZOOF SIGNIFICANTLY
IT MAY SEEM STRANGE BUT THE NEARER THE CRITICAL MOMENT APPROACHED THE LESS HECTOR SERVADAC AND COUNT TIMASCHEFF HAD TO SAY TO EACH OTHER ON THE SUBJECT
SURELY YOU CAN TRUST THE BANKS OF ENGLAND FRANCE AND RUSSIA AH NO
SUPPOSE THEY SAY AN OBSERVER ENDOWED WITH AN INFINITE LENGTH OF VISION
BUT WE MUST TAKE OUR GUNS WHY TAKE OUR GUNS ASKED SERVADAC
AND HOW THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT AND HEAT RECEIVED BY THE PLANET IS ONLY A TWENTY-FIFTH PART OF THAT RECEIVED BY THE EARTH THE AVERAGE DISTANCE FROM THE SUN BEING 475,693,000 MILES
PROFESSOR ROSETTE WAS MANIFESTLY RIGHT IN ASSERTING THAT SUCH A MACHINE WOULD REGISTER RESULTS QUITE INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY CHANGE IN THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION
SO GREAT HOWEVER WAS THE SPEED AT WHICH GALLIA WAS RECEDING FROM THE SUN THAT THIS METEORIC STORM LASTED SCARCELY MORE THAN FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS
WITH NOT A SOUL TO GOVERN GLOOMILY REJOINED THE CAPTAIN
RECOVERING HIS COMPOSURE IN A DEGREE HE CONTINUED
BEFORE LONG THE ASTRONOMER ROUSED HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE AND GLANCED INQUIRINGLY ABOUT HIM BUT SOON RELAPSED INTO HIS COMATOSE CONDITION
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN ONE POINT IT FAILS HOW SO REPLIED PROCOPE
WE MUST POCKET OUR CHAGRIN AND PUT AS GOOD A FACE ON THE MATTER AS WE CAN REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
BUT HE FAILED TO TRACE ANY OF THE LINEAMENTS SUPPOSED TO RESEMBLE A HUMAN FACE THAT MARK THE LUNAR SURFACE
SERVADAC HECTOR BORN AT ST TRELODY IN THE DISTRICT OF LESPARRE DEPARTMENT OF THE GIRONDE JULY 19TH 18 PROPERTY 1200 FRANCS IN RENTES
INDEED I HOPE NOT EXCLAIMED THE PROFESSOR
OH IT IS DIRT CHEAP
AND WHAT WAS EQUALLY INEXPLICABLE IT WAS NOT FOLLOWING THE OBLIQUE CURVE THAT IN THESE LATITUDES AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR MIGHT BE EXPECTED BUT WAS SINKING PERPENDICULARLY ON TO THE HORIZON
BUT FRANCE IS THERE BEYOND
IT MISSED ITS AIM
DURING THE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT IT WAS FAR FROM DISTINCT BUT AFTER NIGHTFALL IT WOULD ASSUME A DEFINITE LUSTER
IT IS FORTUNATE THAT THE EARTH WAS ONLY TOUCHED OBLIQUELY
THEY READ ALOUD AND EXPLAINED EXTRACTS FROM THE ELEMENTARY MANUALS OF SCIENCE OR FROM THE BOOKS OF ADVENTUROUS TRAVEL WHICH THEIR LIBRARY SUPPLIED
THE PROVISIONS OF THE GOURBI WERE STILL FAR FROM EXHAUSTED AND NOW THAT THE ROUGHNESS OF THE WEATHER HAD SO HAPPILY SUBSIDED THEY HAD EVERY ENCOURAGEMENT TO HOPE THAT A SHIP OF SOME SORT WOULD SOON APPEAR
I AM NOT SURE SAID HE BUT WHAT THE TOUR OF THE MEDITERRANEAN WILL PROVE TO BE THE TOUR OF THE WORLD SERVADAC MADE NO REPLY BUT FOR A TIME REMAINED SILENT AND ABSORBED IN THOUGHT
IT SEEMED UNACCOUNTABLE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT USE HER ENGINE AS WHOEVER WAS ON BOARD WOULD BE NATURALLY IMPATIENT TO RECONNOITER THE NEW ISLAND WHICH MUST JUST HAVE COME WITHIN THEIR VIEW
ALL DISCOMFITED AND BEWILDERED BEN ZOOF RETIRED WITHOUT A WORD
QUITE NEAR ENOUGH FOR ME EXCLAIMED BEN ZOOF
I KNOW WELL ENOUGH HE SAID REPEATEDLY TO HIMSELF WHAT I WANT TO SAY
IT IS AN OLD SAYING THAT NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION BESIDES I SHOULD THINK IT VERY UNLIKELY THAT THE INTERNAL HEAT WILL FAIL US NOW BEFORE THE SUMMER THE LIEUTENANT DECLARED THAT HE ENTERTAINED THE SAME HOPE
MORE BOWS WERE INTERCHANGED AND THE CEREMONY BROUGHT TO ITS DUE CONCLUSION
HE HAD GIVEN OUT IN PLAIN TERMS THAT HE DID NOT INTEND TO PART WITH ANY OF HIS PROPERTY EXCEPT FOR CURRENT MONEY AND SERVADAC EQUALLY RESOLUTE HAD STRICTLY FORBIDDEN ANY PURCHASES TO BE MADE HOPING TO WEAR OUT THE RASCAL'S OBSTINACY
LITTLE STREAMS OF WATER BEGAN TO TRICKLE DOWN THE DECLIVITIES OF THE MOUNTAIN AND ALONG THE SHELVING SHORE ONLY TO BE TRANSFORMED AS THE MELTING OF THE SNOW CONTINUED INTO TORRENTS OR CASCADES
IT IS SO IMPORTANT YOU KNOW SO ALL IMPORTANT
THIS WAS THE CASE WITH MARS VENUS AND THAT UNKNOWN ORB WHICH WAS MOVING IN THE ORBIT OF THE MINOR PLANETS
ACCUSTOMED TO THE UNEVEN CRYSTALLIZATIONS OF THEIR OWN FROZEN SEAS THE RUSSIANS COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE THAN DELIGHTED WITH THE POLISHED SURFACE THAT AFFORDED THEM SUCH EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR ENJOYING THEIR FAVORITE PASTIME OF SKATING
ONE PHENOMENON HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO MAKE ITS DUE IMPRESSION UPON THE MEN
ALL ALONG THEIR WAY THEY MADE UNSPARING SLAUGHTER OF THE BIRDS THAT HOVERED OVER AND AROUND THEM
WHAT THEN YOU HAVE TO DO BEN ZOOF IS TO KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT AND TO BE READY IN CASE A VESSEL SHOULD APPEAR TO MAKE SIGNALS AT ONCE BUT IF NO VESSEL SHOULD APPEAR SIGHED THE ORDERLY
THE WHOLE PARTY BEGAN TO MAKE ALMOST DAILY VISITS TO THE HIVE AND FREQUENTLY PROCEEDED TO THE SHORE WHERE THEY RESUMED THEIR SKATING EXERCISE REJOICING IN THEIR RECOVERED FREEDOM LIKE PRISONERS LIBERATED FROM A DUNGEON
YES SAID SERVADAC
GALLIA HAS LOST ITS CHANCE OF GETTING BACK TO THE EARTH
IT CANNOT BE HE EXCLAIMED
HAND US OVER TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FRANCS IN SILVER MONEY OR WE WILL PROCEED TO HELP OURSELVES ISAAC BEGAN TO YELL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
I CONFESS YOU SEEM TO HAVE THE BEST OF THE ARGUMENT AND IF GALLIA HAD BECOME A SATELLITE OF THE MOON IT WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THREE MONTHS TO CATCH SIGHT OF HER
I FORGOT SAID SERVADAC WITH THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS
WHAT FOLLOWED WAS IRRESISTIBLY COMIC
ONE DAY HE SUDDENLY CAME UPON BEN ZOOF AND ASKED HIM WHETHER HE HAD NO PLAN TO PROPOSE
HE HAD REALLY CONSIDERABLE GENIUS FOR THE SCIENCE THAT HE HAD ADOPTED
FROM THE LITTLE ATLAS TO THE MEDITERRANEAN EIGHTEEN MILES
THE SIDES OF THE RIDGE HAD SHELVED TO SO GREAT AN EXTENT THAT WHILE THE DEPTH OF WATER ON THE SUMMIT HAD BEEN LITTLE MORE THAN ELEVEN FATHOMS THAT ON EITHER HAND OF THE ELEVATION WAS LITTLE SHORT OF A HUNDRED FATHOMS
CAPTAIN SERVADAC WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO FIND THAT HIS HOPES ABOUT THE TEMPERATURE WERE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT REALIZED
TWENTY TIMES HAD THE GUN BEEN FIRED AND IT WAS ON THE POINT OF BEING LOADED FOR THE LAST TIME WHEN THE COLONEL LAID HIS HAND UPON THE ARM OF THE MAN WHO HAD THE RAMROD
THE TWO MEN PUT THEIR SHOULDERS TO THE DOOR WHICH SOON YIELDED TO THEIR VIGOROUS EFFORTS AND THEY FOUND THEMSELVES INSIDE THE SHED AND IN ALMOST TOTAL DARKNESS
CIRCUMSTANCES HAD CHANGED AND ALL ANIMOSITY WAS ABSORBED IN THE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH HE HAILED THE PROSPECT OF OBTAINING SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE RECENT STARTLING AND INEXPLICABLE EVENTS
A SYSTEM OF TACKING MIGHT BE CARRIED OUT TO A CERTAIN DEGREE BUT IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT THE YAWL WOULD ANSWER HER HELM IN ANY WAY CORRESPONDING TO WHAT WOULD OCCUR IN THE OPEN SEA
AT ANY RATE IT WILL CONVEY US MUCH CLOSER TO SHORE THAN THE SCHOONER THE COUNT REPLIED THAT THE LIEUTENANT WAS BY ALL MEANS TO USE HIS OWN DISCRETION AND THEY ALL RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT
OH THAT FOR A MOMENT WE COULD SCALE ITS TOWERING HEIGHT AND LOOK BEYOND
TURNING ROUND THEY SAW THAT THE CREW OF THE DOBRYNA WAS IN HOT DISPUTE WITH THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS
HE REVOLVES ON HIS AXIS IN 10 HOURS 29 MINUTES CAUSING HIS OWN YEAR TO CONSIST OF 86,630 DAYS
WE ARE NOT GOING TO RUIN YOU YOU KNOW HAKKABUT LOOKED KEENLY INTO THE CAPTAIN'S FACE
A STOCK OF SHOVELS MATTOCKS AND PICK-AXES WAS BROUGHT FROM THE GOURBI AND WITH BEN ZOOF AS OVERSEER BOTH SPANISH MAJOS AND RUSSIAN SAILORS SET TO WORK WITH A WILL
I SENT THEM OFF BY HUNDREDS
PLENTY OF AIR AND WATER THERE SIR INQUIRED THE ORDERLY
BUT IF IT IS THE MOON WHENCE IN THE NAME OF ALL THE GODS HAS SHE PICKED UP ANOTHER MOON FOR HERSELF THE CAPTAIN WAS IN DIRE PERPLEXITY
