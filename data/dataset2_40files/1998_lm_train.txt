AND IF YE APPERTAIN TO ME STILL IT IS NOT AS MY RIGHT ARM
IS NOT THE LAND MORE FAITHFUL
HIGHER THAN LOVE TO YOUR NEIGHBOUR IS LOVE TO THE FURTHEST AND FUTURE ONES
EVEN MINE ENEMIES PERTAIN TO MY BLISS
AH LIETH EVERYTHING ALREADY WITHERED AND GREY WHICH BUT LATELY STOOD GREEN AND MANY-HUED ON THIS MEADOW
ALSO DO I LIKE TO TICKLE HIM WITH A WAX-TAPER THAT HE MAY FINALLY LET THE HEAVENS EMERGE FROM ASHY-GREY TWILIGHT
THEY ARE CLEVER AND KNOW ALL THAT HATH HAPPENED
ON THE CONTRARY HE CONTINUALLY LOOKED AROUND WITH MOVING GESTURES LIKE ONE FORSAKEN AND ISOLATED FROM ALL THE WORLD
BY BY-WAYS DOTH THE WEAKER THEN SLINK INTO THE FORTRESS AND INTO THE HEART OF THE MIGHTIER ONE--AND THERE STEALETH POWER
YE ARE THOSE WHO AGAIN PRAY
AND THEY REPAY THY BENEFICENCE WITH SECRET MALEFICENCE
A THOUSAND SALUBRITIES AND HIDDEN ISLANDS OF LIFE
INTO MORE DISTANT FUTURES INTO MORE SOUTHERN SOUTHS THAN EVER ARTIST DREAMED OF
AND HOLDING MY NOSE I WENT MOROSELY THROUGH ALL YESTERDAYS AND TO-DAYS
AND EARTH WILL I AGAIN BECOME TO HAVE REST IN HER THAT BORE ME
BUT THE HIGHER THOU RISEST THE SMALLER DOTH THE EYE OF ENVY SEE THEE
FIRST A BEAST BIT THEE AND THEN--A MAN TROD UPON THEE WHEN HOWEVER THE TRODDEN ONE HAD HEARD THE NAME OF ZARATHUSTRA HE WAS TRANSFORMED
RATHER DO I ADVISE YOU TO NEIGHBOUR-FLIGHT AND TO FURTHEST LOVE
REMAIN TRUE TO THE EARTH MY BRETHREN WITH THE POWER OF YOUR VIRTUE
THOU TOOKEST REVENGE ON THIS WITNESS THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND WAS ABOUT TO GO
OR NAY
WHAT HAVE I BEEN SINCE THOU HAST APPEARED AMONGST US
TOO LONG HAVE I LIVED WILDLY IN WILD REMOTENESS TO RETURN TO THEE WITHOUT TEARS
FOR IT DO I BID MY SAILS SEARCH AND SEARCH
VERILY WITH A BAD CONSCIENCE DOTH HE STALK OVER THE ROOFS
HE DOES NOT RECOGNISE HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR OF PUBLIC OPINION AND RECOILS TERRIFIED FROM THE DISTORTED REFLECTION OF HIS FEATURES
THIS HAD ZARATHUSTRA SAID TO HIS HEART WHEN THE SUN STOOD AT NOON-TIDE
THE TREE ON THE HILL
THE TREE ON THE HILL
THOU CANST FOR THOU WILLEST O MY BRETHREN CONCERNING THE STARS AND THE FUTURE THERE HATH HITHERTO BEEN ONLY ILLUSION AND NOT KNOWLEDGE
VERILY HE WHO HERE TOWERED ALOFT HIS THOUGHTS IN STONE KNEW AS WELL AS THE WISEST ONES ABOUT THE SECRET OF LIFE
ALMOST THE WHOLE OF THIS IS QUITE COMPREHENSIBLE
THE KING ON THE RIGHT AND THE KING ON THE LEFT THE OLD MAGICIAN THE POPE THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR THE SHADOW THE INTELLECTUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE THE SORROWFUL SOOTHSAYER AND THE ASS
AS A VIRTUOUS LION NIGH THE DAUGHTERS OF DESERTS ROARING
SO SHALL I WILL IT THIS DID I CALL REDEMPTION
IN VERSE 41 OF THIS MOST DECISIVE DISCOURSE HE TRULY EXPLAINS HIS POSITION WHEN HE SAYS
THAT IT CANNOT BREAK TIME AND TIME'S DESIRE--THAT IS THE WILL'S LONESOMEST TRIBULATION
THAT HOWEVER IS COWARDICE THOUGH IT BE CALLED VIRTUE AND WHEN THEY CHANCE TO SPEAK HARSHLY THOSE SMALL PEOPLE THEN DO I HEAR THEREIN ONLY THEIR HOARSENESS--EVERY DRAUGHT OF AIR MAKETH THEM HOARSE
MAN CANNOT ENDURE IT THAT SUCH A WITNESS SHOULD LIVE THUS SPAKE THE UGLIEST MAN
TO BE TRUE--THAT CAN FEW BE
AS IT HAPPENETH HOWEVER TO EVERY ONE WHO MEDITATETH UPON HARD MATTERS HE TROD THEREBY UNAWARES UPON A MAN
SOME SOLEMN EXHORTATION HA
NOW DO THE SEPULCHRES MUTTER
BUT I CALL THEE MY GRUNTING-PIG,--BY THY GRUNTING THOU SPOILEST EVEN MY PRAISE OF FOLLY
HOW COULD YE PERISH SO SOON FOR ME
ABOUT THE NOONTIDE HOUR HOWEVER WHEN THE CAPTAIN AND HIS MEN WERE TOGETHER AGAIN THEY SAW SUDDENLY A MAN COMING TOWARDS THEM THROUGH THE AIR AND A VOICE SAID DISTINCTLY
THERE IS THE FEELING THAT ONE IS COMPLETELY OUT OF HAND WITH THE VERY DISTINCT CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF FINE THRILLS AND QUIVERINGS TO THE VERY TOES;--THERE IS A DEPTH OF HAPPINESS IN WHICH THE PAINFULLEST AND GLOOMIEST DO NOT OPERATE AS ANTITHESES BUT AS CONDITIONED AS DEMANDED IN THE SENSE OF NECESSARY SHADES OF COLOUR IN SUCH AN OVERFLOW OF LIGHT
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHETHER ZARATHUSTRA STILL LIVETH
AT LENGTH HE CAN WITHSTAND HIM NO LONGER AND ON THE PLEA THAT THE HIGHER MAN IS ON HIS GROUND AND THEREFORE UNDER HIS PROTECTION ZARATHUSTRA DEPARTS IN SEARCH OF HIM LEAVING SCHOPENHAUER--A HIGHER MAN IN NIETZSCHE'S OPINION--IN THE CAVE AS A GUEST
XXIII
THUS ARE YE UNAWARE ALSO OF THE DELIGHT OF ITS COLDNESS
THE MYSTERY OF THE NIGHT HOWEVER CAME NIGHER AND NIGHER TO THEIR HEARTS
BEHOLD HERE IS A NEW TABLE
CANST THOU BE JUDGE FOR THYSELF AND AVENGER OF THY LAW
MORE BEAUTIFUL DOTH IT EVER BECOME AND MORE GRACEFUL--BUT INTERNALLY HARDER AND MORE SUSTAINING--THE HIGHER IT RISETH
FOR YE HAVE NOT LEARNED TO SUBMIT YOURSELVES YE HAVE NOT LEARNED PETTY POLICY
BETTER EVEN A LITTLE TEETH-CHATTERING THAN IDOL-ADORATION!--SO WILLETH MY NATURE
O MY BRETHREN WHEN I ENJOINED YOU TO BREAK UP THE GOOD AND THE TABLES OF THE GOOD THEN ONLY DID I EMBARK MAN ON HIS HIGH SEAS
THUS ARE THINGS WELL MATCHED
UNGRACIOUSLY DID THIS BIRD CRY UNWILLINGLY WAS IT AWAKENED
BUT AFTER A BRIEF SPACE HE AGAIN LAUGHED AND SAID SOOTHEDLY
IS IT NOT BETTER TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF A MURDERER THAN INTO THE DREAMS OF A LUSTFUL WOMAN
SO SPEAKETH JUSTICE
MY ARMS AND MY LEGS HOWEVER I DO NOT TREAT INDULGENTLY I DO NOT TREAT MY WARRIORS INDULGENTLY
FORGIVE IT FOR THIS
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER GOT UP AND PREPARED TO GO ON
FOR THE STUPIDITY OF THE GOOD IS UNFATHOMABLE
AND THIS IS THE ACCOUNT OF ZARATHUSTRA'S INTERVIEW WITH THE FIRE-DOG
THOU GOEST BEYOND THEM
BUT HE--THOU KNOWEST IT FORSOOTH THOU OLD PRIEST THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THY TYPE IN HIM THE PRIEST-TYPE--HE WAS EQUIVOCAL
LIFE IS SOMETHING ESSENTIALLY IMMORAL NIETZSCHE TELLS US IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY EVEN TO CALL LIFE ACTIVITY OR TO DEFINE IT FURTHER AS THE CONTINUOUS ADJUSTMENT OF INTERNAL RELATIONS TO EXTERNAL RELATIONS AS SPENCER HAS IT NIETZSCHE CHARACTERISES AS A DEMOCRATIC IDIOSYNCRACY HE SAYS TO DEFINE IT IN THIS WAY IS TO MISTAKE THE TRUE NATURE AND FUNCTION OF LIFE WHICH IS WILL TO POWER...LIFE IS ESSENTIALLY APPROPRIATION INJURY CONQUEST OF THE STRANGE AND WEAK SUPPRESSION SEVERITY OBTRUSION OF ITS OWN FORMS INCORPORATION AND AT LEAST PUTTING IT MILDEST EXPLOITATION ADAPTATION IS MERELY A SECONDARY ACTIVITY A MERE RE-ACTIVITY SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVII PARS
OPEN STILL REMAINETH A FREE LIFE FOR GREAT SOULS
ONLY IN THE MARKET-PLACE IS ONE ASSAILED BY YEA
WHY DID THIS CRIMINAL COMMIT MURDER
FOLLOW THEM AND ALL WILL BE CLEAR I SEEM TO IMPLY
MY BRETHREN WHEREFORE IS THERE NEED OF THE LION IN THE SPIRIT
WILL TO TRUTH DO YE CALL IT YE WISEST ONES THAT WHICH IMPELLETH YOU AND MAKETH YOU ARDENT
I GO NOT YOUR WAY YE DESPISERS OF THE BODY
THOU IN-ME
THIS STAR STANDETH IN MY HEAVEN EVEN IN DARK NIGHTS
THEN WAS THERE SPOKEN UNTO ME WITHOUT VOICE
THOU COMEST,--I HEAR THEE
WANT DEEP PROFOUND ETERNITY TWELVE
OH I HAVE FOUND IT MY BRETHREN
BUT THE ROPE-DANCER WHO THOUGHT THE WORDS APPLIED TO HIM BEGAN HIS PERFORMANCE
YE ARE MY BELIEVERS
NIGH UNTO THEE THOUGH THOU PROFESSEST TO BE THE UNGODLIEST ONE I FEEL A HALE AND HOLY ODOUR OF LONG BENEDICTIONS
IT IS THE CASE OF THE BRAVEST AND MOST BROAD-MINDED MEN OF TO-DAY
THAT ONE WAS RESERVED IN INTERCOURSE AND CHOSE CHOICELY
AND THEN IT HAPPENED ALSO,--AND VERILY IT HAPPENED FOR THE FIRST TIME!--THAT HIS WORD BLESSED SELFISHNESS THE WHOLESOME HEALTHY SELFISHNESS THAT SPRINGETH FROM THE POWERFUL SOUL FROM THE POWERFUL SOUL TO WHICH THE HIGH BODY APPERTAINETH THE HANDSOME TRIUMPHING REFRESHING BODY AROUND WHICH EVERYTHING BECOMETH A MIRROR
NOT HOWEVER WILL TO LIFE BUT--SO TEACH I THEE--WILL TO POWER
WHERE FORCE IS THERE BECOMETH NUMBER THE MASTER
ALWAYS MORE ALWAYS BETTER ONES OF YOUR TYPE SHALL SUCCUMB--FOR YE SHALL ALWAYS HAVE IT WORSE AND HARDER CHAPTER LXXII
FOR THUS DO YE LIVE--BEST
I SHOULD LIKE TO INJURE THOSE I ILLUMINE
THUS PONDERING AND CRADLED BY FORTY THOUGHTS IT OVERTAKETH ME ALL AT ONCE--SLEEP THE UNSUMMONED THE LORD OF THE VIRTUES
NOW HATH THAT OLD MAGICIAN GIVEN US OF HIS WORST FOR OUR GOOD AND LO
A NORTH WIND AM I TO RIPE FIGS
I AM ZARATHUSTRA WHO ONCE SAID
THEN THOU CANST NOT HAVE FRIENDS
FOR THIS AM I FROM THE HEART AND FROM THE BEGINNING--DRAWING HITHER-DRAWING UPWARD-DRAWING UPBRINGING
THE UGLIEST MAN IS TO BLAME FOR IT ALL
BUT THAT I AM FOND OF WISDOM AND OFTEN TOO FOND IS BECAUSE SHE REMINDETH ME VERY STRONGLY OF LIFE
WHEN HOWEVER HE WAS BUT A STEP BEHIND THERE HAPPENED THE FRIGHTFUL THING WHICH MADE EVERY MOUTH MUTE AND EVERY EYE FIXED--HE UTTERED A YELL LIKE A DEVIL AND JUMPED OVER THE OTHER WHO WAS IN HIS WAY
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER LOOKED AT THE PEOPLE AND WONDERED
THEM--WILL I BLIND
THOU HAST DIVINED HOW THE MAN FEELETH WHO KILLED HIM
HAD I EVER SEEN SO MUCH LOATHING AND PALE HORROR ON ONE COUNTENANCE
THE DRUNKEN SONG
THE DRUNKEN SONG
THE DRUNKEN SONG
IN THEIR PITY WAS THEIR SPIRIT DROWNED
SO WE HAVE AT LAST GIVEN THEM POWER AS WELL;--AND NOW DO THEY TEACH THAT GOOD IS ONLY WHAT PETTY PEOPLE CALL GOOD AND TRUTH IS AT PRESENT WHAT THE PREACHER SPAKE WHO HIMSELF SPRANG FROM THEM THAT SINGULAR SAINT AND ADVOCATE OF THE PETTY PEOPLE WHO TESTIFIED OF HIMSELF
NOW UP
THIS TIME THE CRY CAME OUT OF HIS OWN CAVE
I AM NOT A LAW FOR ALL
SLEEP TOUCHETH MY MOUTH AND IT REMAINETH OPEN
ALSO YE LOVE THE EARTH AND THE EARTHLY
SO THAT IT EXCITED MY COMMISERATION
SO THAT HE SAID OF HIMSELF JESTINGLY
THE SIGN
THE SIGN
THE SIGN
THAT THERE IS STRUGGLE AND INEQUALITY EVEN IN BEAUTY AND WAR FOR POWER AND SUPREMACY
BUT NOT OUT OF THE SWAMP IT WERE WELL IF THIS DISCOURSE WERE TAKEN TO HEART BY ALL THOSE WHO ARE TOO READY TO ASSOCIATE NIETZSCHE WITH LESSER AND NOISER MEN,--WITH MOUNTEBANKS AND MUMMERS
MY STORY IS IMMORAL
WHAT AM I TO THINK OF IT SAID HE ONCE MORE
3 RECALLS REDEMPTION THE LAST VERSE OF PAR
FOR THE WORTHIER FOE O MY BRETHREN SHALL YE RESERVE YOURSELVES
THAT MAN IS A BRIDGE AND NOT A GOAL--REJOICING OVER HIS NOONTIDES AND EVENINGS AS ADVANCES TO NEW ROSY DAWNS
ELSEWHERE HE SAYS A MAN SHOULD BE A HARD BED TO HIS FRIEND THUS ALONE CAN HE BE OF USE TO HIM
AND SOME ARE HOARY IN YOUTH BUT THE LATE YOUNG KEEP LONG YOUNG
AND THERE CAME AN ADDER AND BIT HIM IN THE NECK SO THAT ZARATHUSTRA SCREAMED WITH PAIN
OH HOW MUCH NEW FILTH HATH ALSO COME INTO THE WORLD
AS A HUMANLY GOOD THING DID IT COME UNTO ME THIS DREAM AND HEART-COMFORTER
FOR IT IS THE ADVANCE TO A NEW MORNING
ZARATHUSTRA'S PROLOGUE
ZARATHUSTRA'S PROLOGUE
AND HE SPAKE THUS TO HIS HEART
OUT OF THE EYE OF YOUR JUDGES THERE ALWAYS GLANCETH THE EXECUTIONER AND HIS COLD STEEL
I SHALL HARDLY BE ABLE TO PERSUADE HIM TO EAT THAT DOTH NOT CONCERN ME SAID THE OLD MAN SULLENLY
STEP OUT OF THY CAVE
THOU BAD FALSE COINER HOW COULDST THOU DO OTHERWISE
O ZARATHUSTRA SAID THEY NOW HAST THOU LAIN THUS FOR SEVEN DAYS WITH HEAVY EYES
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER WAS FOND OF ALL THOSE WHO MAKE DISTANT VOYAGES AND DISLIKE TO LIVE WITHOUT DANGER
LOATHING ITSELF CREATETH WINGS AND FOUNTAIN-DIVINING POWERS
FOR IN SEEING THE SUFFERER SUFFERING--THEREOF WAS I ASHAMED ON ACCOUNT OF HIS SHAME
LI
LI
BECAUSE HE WOULD FAIN RETRIEVE THE ERRORS OF HIS FATHERS IN HIS CHILDREN
THEY SOON CLAMBER BACK TO THE CONVENTIONS OF THE AGE THEY INTENDED REFORMING
HAVE YE EVER CRIED THUS
BUT GOD IS UBIQUITOUS AND OMNISCIENT
AND ONE CANNOT ANSWER MORE INDIGNANTLY THAN WHEN ONE TELLETH THE TRUTH TO ONE'S WISDOM
YE HAVE VERILY ALL BLOSSOMED FORTH
I KNOW THOU THINKEST OF SOON LEAVING ME
RATHER ONE WHO HATH EVEN UNLEARNT PATIENCE,--BECAUSE HE NO LONGER SUFFERETH FOR MY FATE GIVETH ME TIME
BUT EVEN YET A WILD BEAST GAZETH OUT OF HIS SERIOUSNESS--AN UNCONQUERED WILD BEAST
HE WHO LEARNETH MUCH UNLEARNETH ALL VIOLENT CRAVINGS"--THAT DO PEOPLE NOW WHISPER TO ONE ANOTHER IN ALL THE DARK LANES
I WANT TO HAVE GOBLINS ABOUT ME FOR I AM COURAGEOUS
A FOOL SEEMETH THIS WISE MAN WITH HIS FORTY THOUGHTS
LEAVE THIS TOWN O ZARATHUSTRA SAID HE THERE ARE TOO MANY HERE WHO HATE THEE
ALONE AM I AGAIN AND LIKE TO BE SO ALONE WITH THE PURE HEAVEN AND THE OPEN SEA
AND NEVER YET COULD YE CAST YOUR SPIRIT INTO A PIT OF SNOW
AND ALL THE OTHERS THEN THRONGED AROUND ZARATHUSTRA GRASPED HIM BY THE HANDS AND TRIED TO PERSUADE HIM TO LEAVE HIS BED AND HIS SADNESS AND RETURN UNTO THEM
IF WE CAREFULLY FOLLOW THE ATTITUDE HE ASSUMES WE SHALL UNDERSTAND WHY ZARATHUSTRA FINALLY INTERRUPTS HIM
IT IS THE VOICE OF THEIR WILL TO POWER
OPEN STILL REMAINETH THE EARTH FOR GREAT SOULS
FOR HE IS COVETOUS AND JEALOUS THE MONK IN THE MOON

NOTES ON THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA BY ANTHONY M
NOTES ON THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA BY ANTHONY M
HERE HOWEVER IS MY COURT
MINE OLD HEART LEAPETH AND BOUNDETH BECAUSE THERE IS STILL SOMETHING TO ADORE ON EARTH
THE DAY COMETH
FOR A COMING BLISS OVERSPREAD HIS COUNTENANCE LIKE THE ROSY DAWN
BUT FOR THEM TO BELIEVE FULLY IN THEE ONE THING IS STILL NEEDFUL--THOU MUST FIRST OF ALL CONVINCE US CRIPPLES
THEIR PITY IS IT FROM WHICH I FLEE AWAY HE SAYS--THAT IS TO SAY
WHAT GOOD IS MY VIRTUE
AND IN HELPING HIM SORELY DID I WOUND HIS PRIDE
HERE HE TELLS HIGHER MEN THE CLASS OF COURAGE HE EXPECTS FROM THEM
WHAT HATH HITHERTO BEEN THE GREATEST SIN HERE ON EARTH
WHAT HATH HITHERTO BEEN THE GREATEST SIN HERE ON EARTH
ON HIS WAY ZARATHUSTRA MEETS TWO MORE HIGHER MEN OF HIS TIME
THE SUN HATH BEEN LONG SET SAID HE AT LAST THE MEADOW IS DAMP AND FROM THE FOREST COMETH COOLNESS
THE ZARATHUSTRA WORD OF THE GREAT NOONTIDE AND WHATEVER ELSE I HAVE HUNG UP OVER MEN LIKE PURPLE EVENING-AFTERGLOWS
EUROPEAN HONOUR
FOR I SEEK MORE SECURITY
IF IT CONTAINED ONLY THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA AND THE OLD AND NEW TABLES I SHOULD STILL BE OF THIS OPINION
THOU POET
BUT DISGUISED DO I WANT TO SEE YOU YE NEIGHBOURS AND FELLOWMEN AND WELL-ATTIRED AND VAIN AND ESTIMABLE AS THE GOOD AND JUST AND DISGUISED WILL I MYSELF SIT AMONGST YOU--THAT I MAY MISTAKE YOU AND MYSELF
AND PEOPLE THINK IT SO WHEN I HAD SAID THIS THE FIRE-DOG ACTED AS IF MAD WITH ENVY
OF THIS IMPOSTURE HAVE WE AT LAST BECOME WEARY AND DISGUSTED IT IS THE KINGS WHO TELL ZARATHUSTRA
CHAPTER LIV
BUT UNJOYOUSLY THIS TIME DOTH THE BEAR GO BACK TO HIS CAVE
NOW DO ALL GUSHING FOUNTAINS SPEAK LOUDER
NOW DO ALL GUSHING FOUNTAINS SPEAK LOUDER
AND ONE THING MORE DO I KNOW
HOW TIRED I AM ON THE HEIGHT HERE THE YOUTH WAS SILENT
THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA IS TAKEN HOME
THUS DID HE HOWEVER THIS ABSOLUTE ONE
TO EACH SOUL IS EVERY OTHER SOUL A BACK-WORLD
THUS IS HE RARELY FOUND WRONG
THE PHANTOM THAT RUNNETH ON BEFORE THEE MY BROTHER IS FAIRER THAN THOU
BOTH ARE TOO BURDENSOME THIS IS RAPIDLY BECOMING EVERYBODY'S ATTITUDE TO-DAY
THE HUNCHBACK HOWEVER HAD LISTENED TO THE CONVERSATION AND HAD COVERED HIS FACE DURING THE TIME
FOR THE GOOD--THEY CANNOT CREATE
I WOULD HAVE THY VICTORY AND FREEDOM LONG FOR A CHILD
AND IF THERE BE INNOCENCE IN MY KNOWLEDGE IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS WILL TO PROCREATION IN IT
AND HE SHOUTED FOR JOY
LITTLE IS LACKING FOR OUR SPIRITS TO BECOME WANTON
MANY A POISONOUS HOTCHPOTCH HATH EVOLVED IN OUR CELLARS
I HAVE MYSELF GIVEN THEE THE NAMES CHANGE OF NEED AND FATE O MY SOUL I HAVE GIVEN THEE NEW NAMES AND GAY-COLOURED PLAYTHINGS I HAVE CALLED THEE FATE AND THE CIRCUIT OF CIRCUITS AND THE NAVEL-STRING OF TIME AND THE AZURE BELL O MY SOUL TO THY DOMAIN GAVE I ALL WISDOM TO DRINK ALL NEW WINES AND ALSO ALL IMMEMORIALLY OLD STRONG WINES OF WISDOM
IN THE MIDST HOWEVER OF THAT SORROWFUL COMPANY STOOD ZARATHUSTRA'S EAGLE RUFFLED AND DISQUIETED FOR IT HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO ANSWER TOO MUCH FOR WHICH ITS PRIDE HAD NOT ANY ANSWER
XXIV
XXIV
BEST OF ALL DO I SEE YOU MY FRIENDS THROW THE GOLDEN BALL
AND WHEN THEY BECOME SUBTLE AND COLD IT IS NOT SPIRIT BUT ENVY THAT MAKETH THEM SO
HE WOULD HAVE US REAR AN IDEAL RACE
HOW COULDST THOU MOUNT UPWARD OTHERWISE
EVEN FOR THEE THERE IS STILL A PATH TO GREATNESS AH MY BRETHREN
WHAT IS THIS GLOOMY CLOUD ABOUT TO DO TO US
ALAS WILT THOU NOW GO ASHORE
TO FREE HEARTS A THING INNOCENT AND FREE THE GARDEN-HAPPINESS OF THE EARTH ALL THE FUTURE'S THANKS-OVERFLOW TO THE PRESENT
THINE EVIL EYES SHOOT OUT UPON ME THY CURLY LITTLE MANE FROM UNDERNEATH
IN DANGEROUS PATHS GOETH ZARATHUSTRA
AH IS IT MY WORD
THEY WOULD FAIN CRUCIFY THOSE WHO DEVISE THEIR OWN VIRTUE--THEY HATE THE LONESOME ONES
THE HOUR IN WHICH EVEN YOUR HAPPINESS BECOMETH LOATHSOME UNTO YOU AND SO ALSO YOUR REASON AND VIRTUE
THEY ARE MERRY HE BEGAN AGAIN AND WHO KNOWETH
BUT WHERE THIS IS NOT THE CASE THE ADVICE HE HIMSELF GIVES IS AFTER ALL THE BEST TO BE FOLLOWED HERE VIZ.:--TO REGARD SUCH WORKS AS
BUT THIS ART ALSO MUST ONE LEARN
A DANCE-SONG AND SATIRE ON THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY MY SUPREMEST POWERFULEST DEVIL WHO IS SAID TO BE LORD OF THE WORLD AND THIS IS THE SONG THAT ZARATHUSTRA SANG WHEN CUPID AND THE MAIDENS DANCED TOGETHER
AND MANY OF YOU WOULD TUMBLE OVER IF YE BUT HEARD THE LOUD BEATING OF MY DRUMS
FAR TOO LONG DID HE SIT IN THE SHADE
HIGHER
HIM WHO TEACHETH
THEN ZARATHUSTRA TOLD THEM THAT HE NOW WANTED TO GO ALONE
THOU ILL ANNOUNCER SAID ZARATHUSTRA AT LAST THAT IS A CRY OF DISTRESS AND THE CRY OF A MAN
IT LOVETH TO FLY AWAY!--MAY MY PRIDE THEN FLY WITH MY FOLLY THUS BEGAN ZARATHUSTRA'S DOWN-GOING
ART THOU NOT THYSELF THE COFFIN FULL OF MANY-HUED MALICES AND ANGEL-CARICATURES OF LIFE
HE WRITES ABOUT IT AS FOLLOWS:--"I SPENT A MELANCHOLY SPRING IN ROME WHERE I ONLY JUST MANAGED TO LIVE,--AND THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER
DO EVER WHAT YE WILL--BUT FIRST BE SUCH AS CAN WILL PAR
WHEN HOWEVER THEY RAISED HIM AND SET HIM UPON HIS FEET BEHOLD ALL ON A SUDDEN HIS EYE CHANGED
I RECOGNISE MY DESTINY SAID HE AT LAST SADLY
PAST THE WICKEDNESS OF MY SNOWFLAKES IN JUNE
HOW ASHAMED I AM OF MY CLAMBERING AND STUMBLING
CHAPTER LXXV
THEY ROT EVEN IN THE SUMMER
BEFORE GOD!--NOW HOWEVER THIS GOD HATH DIED
HOW COULDST THOU BECOME NEW IF THOU HAVE NOT FIRST BECOME ASHES
AND ESPECIALLY THAT I AM HOSTILE TO THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY THAT IS BIRD-NATURE:--VERILY DEADLY HOSTILE SUPREMELY HOSTILE ORIGINALLY HOSTILE
BUT OF WHAT ACCOUNT IS ZARATHUSTRA
BELIEF SAVETH HIM
AT THE DOOR OF HIS FAITH STANDETH ADULTERY
THE FACT DAWNED UPON HIM SLOWLY
AND IF THOU WOULDST NOW DIE O ZARATHUSTRA BEHOLD WE KNOW ALSO HOW THOU WOULDST THEN SPEAK TO THYSELF:--BUT THINE ANIMALS BESEECH THEE NOT TO DIE YET
BEHOLD THOU ART THE TEACHER OF THE ETERNAL RETURN,--THAT IS NOW THY FATE
HE IS IN MY DOMAIN
THOU HAST HAD A BAD DAY
THOU HAST HAD A BAD DAY
YOUR CHILDREN'S LAND SHALL YE LOVE
CHEER UP OLD BEAR
AH HE ONLY WHO KNOWETH WHITHER HE SAILETH KNOWETH WHAT WIND IS GOOD AND A FAIR WIND FOR HIM
SOMEWHERE THERE ARE STILL PEOPLES AND HERDS BUT NOT WITH US MY BRETHREN
INNOCENCE IS THE CHILD AND FORGETFULNESS A NEW BEGINNING A GAME A SELF-ROLLING WHEEL A FIRST MOVEMENT A HOLY YEA
IF ONE ANNOUNCE ONE'S WISDOM WITH BELLS THE SHOPMEN IN THE MARKET-PLACE WILL OUT-JINGLE IT WITH PENNIES
STUNG ALL OVER BY POISONOUS FLIES AND HOLLOWED LIKE THE STONE BY MANY DROPS OF WICKEDNESS
AND NOW ONLY COMETH UNTO HIM THE GREAT TERROR THE GREAT OUTLOOK THE GREAT SICKNESS THE GREAT NAUSEA THE GREAT SEA-SICKNESS
AND THEREBY YE WISEST ONES DO I SOLVE YOU THE RIDDLE OF YOUR HEARTS
AND ALSO AMONGST MEN DO I HATE MOST OF ALL THE SOFT-TREADERS AND HALF-AND-HALF ONES AND THE DOUBTING HESITATING PASSING CLOUDS
THE FRENCH THEN SAY LE DIABLE SE FAIT HERMITE BUT THESE MEN AS A RULE HAVE NEVER BEEN DEVILS NEITHER DO THEY BECOME ANGELS
THE WAY TO HOLINESS,"--I SHOULD STILL SAY
AND YET MUST I LEARN TO APPROACH THEE MORE MODESTLY
AND THAT AMONGST MEN THOU WILT EVER BE WILD AND STRANGE
THE STUPIDITY OF THE GOOD IS UNFATHOMABLY WISE
THIS EXCITETH OLD PALATES
HERE IS INDEED THE STONE SAID HE AND STROKED HIS BEARD ON IT SAT I YESTER-MORN
WHEN HOWEVER IT HAD BEEN STILL THERE FOR A LONG WHILE HE LOOKED BEHIND AND SAW ZARATHUSTRA STANDING TREMBLING
MUCH IS RECKONED HIGHER THAN LIFE ITSELF BY THE LIVING ONE
AND THAT I MAY DO THE LIKE BY DAY AND IMITATE AND COPY ITS BEST NOW WILL I PUT THE THREE WORST THINGS ON THE SCALES AND WEIGH THEM HUMANLY WELL HE WHO TAUGHT TO BLESS TAUGHT ALSO TO CURSE
AMONGST THEM WILL MY SUN SET
A LIGHT HATH DAWNED UPON ME
A LIGHT HATH DAWNED UPON ME
BE NOT CONSIDERATE OF THY NEIGHBOUR
LIVING MONUMENTS SHALT THOU BUILD TO THY VICTORY AND EMANCIPATION
HE HOWEVER IS THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY
DISGUST DISGUST DISGUST WE KNOW NIETZSCHE'S IDEAL MAN WAS THAT WORLD-APPROVING EXUBERANT AND VIVACIOUS CREATURE WHO HAS NOT ONLY LEARNT TO COMPROMISE AND ARRANGE WITH THAT WHICH WAS AND IS BUT WISHES TO HAVE IT AGAIN AS IT WAS AND IS FOR ALL ETERNITY INSATIABLY CALLING OUT DA CAPO NOT ONLY TO HIMSELF BUT TO THE WHOLE PIECE AND PLAY SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER XLII BUT IF ONE ASK ONESELF WHAT THE CONDITIONS TO SUCH AN ATTITUDE ARE ONE WILL REALISE IMMEDIATELY HOW UTTERLY DIFFERENT NIETZSCHE WAS FROM HIS IDEAL
WHERE IS THE FRENZY WITH WHICH YE SHOULD BE INOCULATED
INSATIABLY STRIVETH YOUR SOUL FOR TREASURES AND JEWELS BECAUSE YOUR VIRTUE IS INSATIABLE IN DESIRING TO BESTOW
AND NOW ACCEPT A LITTLE TRUTH BY WAY OF THANKS
A LEG NEVERTHELESS IS NOT A WING
THE DOG HOWLETH THE MOON SHINETH
LET MAN FEAR WOMAN WHEN SHE LOVETH
ONE IS ALWAYS TOO MANY ABOUT ME"--THINKETH THE ANCHORITE
VERILY IT IS DIFFICULT TO PROVE ALL BEING AND HARD TO MAKE IT SPEAK
OH HOW SAD THE BUFFOONS OF THE POPULACE SEEM TO ME TO-DAY
WHAT DOTH IT MATTER HOW HE LOOK
AND THE EARTH IS FULL OF THOSE TO WHOM DEATH HATH TO BE PREACHED
AND IT IS RIGHT THAT IT SHOULD BE SO
NIETZSCHE WAS NOT AN ICONOCLAST FROM CHOICE
AND WHEN YOUR SOUL BECOMETH GREAT THEN DOTH IT BECOME HAUGHTY AND IN YOUR SUBLIMITY THERE IS WICKEDNESS
FOR I HAVE SOUGHT OUT WHAT TASTETH SWEETLY AND MAKETH PURE BREATH
IT STINGETH ME--ALAS--TO THE HEART
WHEN COMETH MINE HOUR
25
THOU--HANGMAN-GOD
TO YOU THE DARING VENTURERS AND ADVENTURERS AND WHOEVER HATH EMBARKED WITH CUNNING SAILS UPON FRIGHTFUL SEAS TO YOU THE ENIGMA-INTOXICATED THE TWILIGHT-ENJOYERS WHOSE SOULS ARE ALLURED BY FLUTES TO EVERY TREACHEROUS GULF
THIS COUNSEL HOWEVER DO I COUNSEL TO KINGS AND CHURCHES AND TO ALL THAT IS WEAK WITH AGE OR VIRTUE--LET YOURSELVES BE O'ERTHROWN
THUS DO I PRAY AND CONJURE YOU
ALL OUR FOUNTAINS HAVE DRIED UP EVEN THE SEA HATH RECEDED
AND HE WHO PERSECUTETH WELL LEARNETH READILY TO BE OBSEQUENT--WHEN ONCE HE IS--PUT BEHIND
AH THAT HIS BEST IS SO VERY SMALL THE GREAT DISGUST AT MAN--IT STRANGLED ME AND HAD CREPT INTO MY THROAT
HE HATH COURAGE 5
O YE HIGHER MEN YOUR DISTRESS WAS IT THAT THE OLD SOOTHSAYER FORETOLD TO ME YESTER-MORN UNTO YOUR DISTRESS DID HE WANT TO SEDUCE AND TEMPT ME

WORSE VERILY DOEST THOU HERE THAN WITH THY BAD BROWN GIRLS THOU BAD NEW BELIEVER IT IS SAD ENOUGH ANSWERED THE WANDERER AND SHADOW THOU ART RIGHT
TOO MUCH HAVE I HEARKENED UNTO THE BROOKS AND TREES
EVEN IN THEIR TALK DO I STILL FEEL THE EVIL FLAVOUR OF CHARNEL-HOUSES
AND YE WISE AND KNOWING ONES YE WOULD FLEE FROM THE SOLAR-GLOW OF THE WISDOM IN WHICH THE SUPERMAN JOYFULLY BATHETH HIS NAKEDNESS
HEAREST THOU NOT HOW SPIRIT HATH HERE BECOME A VERBAL GAME
IT HATH COME--THEIR HOUR FOR HUNT AND PROCESSION NOT INDEED FOR A WILD HUNT BUT FOR A TAME LAME SNUFFLING SOFT-TREADERS SOFT-PRAYERS HUNT FOR A HUNT AFTER SUSCEPTIBLE SIMPLETONS
AND IF THEY SHOULD ALTOGETHER PRAISE ME HOW COULD I GO TO SLEEP ON THEIR PRAISE
YE HIGHER MEN AWAY FROM THE MARKET-PLACE
TOMORROW HE HATH A NEW BELIEF AND THE DAY AFTER ONE STILL NEWER
HE WHO MOST LOVED AND POSSESSED HIM HATH NOW ALSO LOST HIM MOST
BUT WITHOUT CLOUDS
YE WANT REWARD FOR VIRTUE AND HEAVEN FOR EARTH AND ETERNITY FOR YOUR TO-DAY
DOTH IT NOT JUST NOW DRINK A DROP OF HAPPINESS AN OLD BROWN DROP OF GOLDEN HAPPINESS GOLDEN WINE
AND UNTO HIM WHO HATH STILL EARS FOR THE UNHEARD WILL I MAKE THE HEART HEAVY WITH MY HAPPINESS
AT ALL EVENTS A VERY NECESSARY CONDITION IN ITS PRODUCTION WAS A RENAISSANCE IN MYSELF OF THE ART OF HEARING
WELCOME TARANTULA
LET MY CAVE BE YOUR RESTING-PLACE
MEANWHILE THE EVENING CAME ON AND THE MARKET-PLACE VEILED ITSELF IN GLOOM
THEREFORE SHALL YE BE CREATORS
ADMIRABLY DO FOREST AND ROCK KNOW HOW TO BE SILENT WITH THEE
THOU FALSE COINER
WHERE IS BEAUTY
NO BETTER ARTS DID I ONCE DREAM OF THAN YOUR ARTS
BUT NOW PRAY SPEAK ALSO OF THY WISDOM AH AND NOW HAST THOU AGAIN OPENED THINE EYES O BELOVED LIFE
THE POSSESSING SOUL WHICH SEEKETH TO ATTAIN DESIRE AND LONGING THE SOUL FLEEING FROM ITSELF WHICH OVERTAKETH ITSELF IN THE WIDEST CIRCUIT
ON THEIR GREAT GRAVE-HIGHWAY DID I SEAT MYSELF AND EVEN BESIDE THE CARRION AND VULTURES--AND I LAUGHED AT ALL THEIR BYGONE AND ITS MELLOW DECAYING GLORY
AND THEY SAY THEIR MARRIAGES ARE MADE IN HEAVEN
JUST LICK IT UP THOU GROWLING BEAR AND SWEETEN THY SOUL
MAY IT NOT BE UNIFORM WHAT THEY THEREWITH HIDE
I BREAK DOWN BY MY WORD
TO YOU MY BRETHREN DO I CAST THIS CROWN
NOW HOWEVER THAT THE WAY HE HAD CHOSEN GREW EVER MORE PERILOUS AND STEEP HE FOUND NOBODY WHO COULD FOLLOW HIM
AND VERILY I LOVE YOU BECAUSE YE KNOW NOT TO-DAY HOW TO LIVE YE HIGHER MEN
SO DOTH IT CALL ALL THE WIT THAT SLAVES AND HOARY-HEADED AND WEARY ONES AFFECT
EVEN THE WORST THING HATH TWO GOOD REVERSE SIDES EVEN THE WORST THING HATH GOOD DANCING-LEGS
EVERY ONE REGARDETH DYING AS A GREAT MATTER
NEVER YET HAVE I FOUND THE WOMAN BY WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE
NEVER YET HAVE I FOUND THE WOMAN BY WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE
NEVER YET HAVE I FOUND THE WOMAN BY WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE
NEVER YET HAVE I FOUND THE WOMAN BY WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE
NEVER YET HAVE I FOUND THE WOMAN BY WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE
NEVER YET HAVE I FOUND THE WOMAN BY WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE
NEVER YET HAVE I FOUND THE WOMAN BY WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE
TOO LONG HATH SOLITUDE POSSESSED ME
FOR DOST THOU REMEMBER O ZARATHUSTRA
AND PEOPLE THINK IT SO AND SO MUCH VAPOUR AND TERRIBLE VOICES CAME OUT OF HIS THROAT THAT I THOUGHT HE WOULD CHOKE WITH VEXATION AND ENVY
NOT ONLY THE RATIONALITY OF MILLENNIUMS--ALSO THEIR MADNESS BREAKETH OUT IN US
THEY LAY LURES FOR ONE ANOTHER THEY LURE THINGS OUT OF ONE ANOTHER,--THAT THEY CALL GOOD NEIGHBOURLINESS O BLESSED REMOTE PERIOD WHEN A PEOPLE SAID TO ITSELF
AND THEN IT SOUGHT TO GET THROUGH THE ULTIMATE WALLS WITH ITS HEAD--AND NOT WITH ITS HEAD ONLY--INTO THE OTHER WORLD BUT THAT OTHER WORLD IS WELL CONCEALED FROM MAN THAT DEHUMANISED INHUMAN WORLD WHICH IS A CELESTIAL NAUGHT
GRACEFULNESS BELONGETH TO THE MUNIFICENCE OF THE MAGNANIMOUS
AND TALK FIRST AND FOREMOST TO MINE ANIMALS
PRAISED BE THE BEST THE LIVEST CUPPING-GLASS THAT AT PRESENT LIVETH
THE EARTHQUAKE WHICH BREAKETH AND UPBREAKETH ALL THAT IS ROTTEN AND HOLLOW
AH YES
AND NOW DO THEY CRY
DOTH ONE GO INTO CAVES AND HIGH MOUNTAINS TO MAKE SUCH REPASTS
UNIFORM ONE CALLETH WHAT THEY WEAR
THIS IS NOW THY PURITY UNTO ME THAT THERE IS NO ETERNAL REASON-SPIDER AND REASON-COBWEB THAT THOU ART TO ME A DANCING-FLOOR FOR DIVINE CHANCES THAT THOU ART TO ME A TABLE OF THE GODS FOR DIVINE DICE AND DICE-PLAYERS BUT THOU BLUSHEST
IT IS TO BE HOPED HOWEVER THAT WE MAY LEARN IN TIME THAT THE SAME ACTION PERFORMED BY A GIVEN NUMBER OF MEN LOSES ITS IDENTITY PRECISELY THAT SAME NUMBER OF TIMES.--"QUOD LICET JOVI NON LICET BOVI AT THE LAST EIGHT VERSES MANY READERS MAY BE TEMPTED TO LAUGH
MANY A ONE HAVE I FOUND WHO STRETCHED AND INFLATED HIMSELF AND THE PEOPLE CRIED
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IN IT
THE PEOPLE HAVE YE SERVED AND THE PEOPLE'S SUPERSTITION--NOT THE TRUTH!--ALL YE FAMOUS WISE ONES
THOU PURE THOU LOFTY HEAVEN
IF THEY DO NOT SUCCEED THEN MUST THEY THEMSELVES DIE
FALSE SHORES AND FALSE SECURITIES DID THE GOOD TEACH YOU
ON AN AFTERNOON ALSO DID I FIND THEM A SECOND TIME:--AT THE HOUR WHEN ALL LIGHT BECOMETH STILLER
THE CONSUMMATING DEATH I SHOW UNTO YOU WHICH BECOMETH A STIMULUS AND PROMISE TO THE LIVING
AND ALAS FOR EVERY LIVING THING THAT WOULD LIVE WITHOUT DISPUTE ABOUT WEIGHT AND SCALES AND WEIGHER
O DAY THOU GROPEST FOR ME
THE PRAISER DOETH AS IF HE GAVE BACK
FEEL PAIN AND THEREUPON IT SUFFERETH AND THINKETH HOW IT MAY PUT AN END THERETO--AND FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE IT IS MEANT TO THINK
THIS CITY WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY UNSUITED TO THE POET-AUTHOR OF ZARATHUSTRA AND FOR THE CHOICE OF WHICH I WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE MADE ME INORDINATELY MISERABLE
FREE THE DEAD
THERE HE ENJOYED HIS SPIRIT AND SOLITUDE AND FOR TEN YEARS DID NOT WEARY OF IT
AND ZARATHUSTRA RAN AND RAN BUT HE FOUND NO ONE ELSE AND WAS ALONE AND EVER FOUND HIMSELF AGAIN
YE HIGHER MEN DO LEARN IT THAT JOYS WANT ETERNITY
WHO IS SHE THEN THIS WISDOM?"--THEN SAID I EAGERLY
NOTHING IS TRUE
IT IS TRUE WE LOVE LIFE
HE THIRSTED FOR THE HAPPINESS OF THE KNIFE
THEN HOWEVER SOMETHING HAPPENED WHICH MADE EVERY MOUTH MUTE AND EVERY EYE FIXED
I BELIEVE IN ZARATHUSTRA BUT ZARATHUSTRA SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SMILED BELIEF DOTH NOT SANCTIFY ME SAID HE LEAST OF ALL THE BELIEF IN MYSELF
THE OLD GOD LIVETH AGAIN O ZARATHUSTRA THOU MAYST SAY WHAT THOU WILT
THEREWITH DO I TRAMPLE AND TROT OVER STICK AND STONE IN THE FIELDS UP AND DOWN AND AM BEDEVILLED WITH DELIGHT IN ALL FAST RACING
HOW SHOULD A STREAM NOT FINALLY FIND ITS WAY TO THE SEA
THAT HAVE I LEARNED NOW
THIS PARABLE I SPEAK UNTO THE POETS
IT IS TIME IT IS THE HIGHEST TIME ZARATHUSTRA WAS SILENT THEREUPON CONFUSED AND STAGGERED
SULTRY AND DUST-COVERED LAY MY SOUL
AND THIRST FOR THE NIGHTLY
IF THERE WERE GODS HOW COULD I ENDURE IT TO BE NO GOD
THE QUESTION IS ONE WHICH OUGHT TO BE STUDIED
AND SAW IT ALSO WITH HAIR BRISTLING ITS HEAD UPWARDS TREMBLING IN THE STILLEST MIDNIGHT WHEN EVEN DOGS BELIEVE IN GHOSTS
A LITTLE MORE A LITTLE LESS
THEY CAST THEIR EYE DOWN INTO THE FOUNTAIN
THOU RESEMBLEST THOSE WHO WITH THEIR PRAISE OF CHASTITY SECRETLY INVITE TO VOLUPTUOUSNESS THUS SPAKE THE CONSCIENTIOUS ONE
WHEREVER THERE IS AUGHT PUNY OR SICKLY OR SCABBY THERE DO THEY CREEP LIKE LICE
ON SUCH A WITNESS I WOULD HAVE REVENGE--OR NOT LIVE MYSELF
IF IT SHOULD SINK TO THE BOTTOM HOWEVER TELL ME WHO WILL BRING IT OUT AGAIN
IT IS WOMEN'S STRONGEST AND MOST VALUABLE INSTINCTS WHICH HELP TO DETERMINE WHO ARE TO BE THE FATHERS OF THE NEXT GENERATION
BETTER UNDERSTANDETH HE ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH
HAPPINESS RUNNETH AFTER ME
SEE THAT IT BE NOT A BAD ARRANGING
MAY THERE BE FRIENDSHIP
THEY HAVE COLD WITHERED EYES BEFORE WHICH EVERY BIRD IS UNPLUMED
HE VEILED HIS COUNTENANCE AND MADE HIS WATER MUDDY THAT NO ONE MIGHT SEE THERETHROUGH AND THEREUNDER
MAY THEY PREACH DESISTANCE FROM LIFE AND PASS AWAY THEMSELVES
AND HE WHO EVER THRASHETH STRAW WHY SHOULD HE BE ALLOWED TO RAIL AT THRASHING
HE DID NOT MEAN TO BE ASHAMED OF HIS MADNESS
IF EVER A BREATH HATH COME TO ME OF THE CREATIVE BREATH AND OF THE HEAVENLY NECESSITY WHICH COMPELLETH EVEN CHANCES TO DANCE STAR-DANCES
WHAT WAS IT FELL LAST NIGHT FROM THE EVIL MOON
FOR THUS DO THINGS STAND WITH US THREE
ZARATHUSTRA IS NO LONGER A SCHOLAR IT SAID THIS AND WENT AWAY CLUMSILY AND PROUDLY
MY SPIRITUAL CONSCIENCE REQUIRETH FROM ME THAT IT SHOULD BE SO--THAT I SHOULD KNOW ONE THING AND NOT KNOW ALL ELSE
CHANCE FLATTERETH ME SMOOTH-TONGUED CHANCE
THUS DO I SPEAK UNTO YOU COWARDS
LET THE LITTLE GIRLS SAY
DO I COUNSEL YOU TO CHASTITY
SO IT IS WITH US ALSO THUS SPAKE TO EACH OTHER THE TWO OLD NIGHT-WATCHMEN AND LIGHT-SCARERS AND TOOTED THEREUPON SORROWFULLY ON THEIR HORNS
HE WHO CAN BE PROUD OF HIS ENEMIES WHO CAN BE GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR THE OBSTACLES THEY HAVE PUT IN HIS WAY
OR THERE ALONG THE LAKE WHERE GOLD-FISHES DANCE AND SWIM
YE MUST BE PROUD OF YOUR FOES
A NEW PRIDE TAUGHT ME MINE EGO AND THAT TEACH I UNTO MEN
THOU CROWDST ME PRESSEST HA
GLADLY DO I RUN AWAY FROM HIM
I LOVE THE BRAVE
BUT KNOW THAT IT IS I THE UGLIEST MAN WHO HAVE ALSO THE LARGEST HEAVIEST FEET
PEOPLE COMMENDED UNTO ZARATHUSTRA A WISE MAN AS ONE WHO COULD DISCOURSE WELL ABOUT SLEEP AND VIRTUE
FOR IN HIS HEART ZARATHUSTRA BELIEVED UNTIL THE END THAT THE MAGICIAN WAS A HIGHER MAN BROKEN BY MODERN VALUES
GOOD AND EVIL AND RICH AND POOR AND HIGH AND LOW AND ALL NAMES OF VALUES
OF DEFECTS DID THE SPIRIT OF THOSE SAVIOURS CONSIST
ONE THIRSTETH FOR HER AND IS NOT SATISFIED ONE LOOKETH THROUGH VEILS ONE GRASPETH THROUGH NETS
WILL TO LOVE
OH THE DARKENING OF MY SUN
UNCONSCIOUS COMPANIONS AND BRETHREN ROVE AROUND ME
BEWARE LEST IN THE END A NARROW FAITH CAPTURE THEE SAYS ZARATHUSTRA FOR NOW EVERYTHING THAT IS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTETH THEE CHAPTER LXX
PIERCE THROUGH AND REND MY HEART
AND VERILY THERE CAME DOWN UPON HIM AS IT WERE A CLOUD LIKE A CLOUD OF ARROWS WHICH POURETH UPON A NEW ENEMY
THERE EVERYTHING BECOMETH FALSE AND DISTORTED AND MONSTROUS THE KINGS ARE ALSO ASKED BY ZARATHUSTRA TO ACCEPT THE SHELTER OF HIS CAVE WHEREUPON HE PROCEEDS ON HIS WAY
MANY YEARS AGO PASSED HE BY
XXX
XXX
VERILY I HAVE TAKEN FROM YOU A HUNDRED FORMULAE AND YOUR VIRTUE'S FAVOURITE PLAYTHINGS
ON THAT ACCOUNT ALONE DOST THOU PRAISE LIFE THEN HAD I ALMOST ANSWERED INDIGNANTLY AND TOLD THE TRUTH TO THE ANGRY ONE
TO CLOSE THE OPEN HAND OUT OF LOVE AND KEEP MODEST AS A GIVER
BUT ALWAYS DID I DRAW UP THE HEAD OF SOME ANCIENT GOD
THE SMALL MAN RETURNETH ETERNALLY NAKED HAD I ONCE SEEN BOTH OF THEM THE GREATEST MAN AND THE SMALLEST MAN
DEEPER DOWN INTO PAIN THAN I EVER ASCENDED EVEN INTO ITS DARKEST FLOOD
COULD YE CREATE A GOD?--THEN I PRAY YOU BE SILENT ABOUT ALL GODS
THE FIGURE OF CHRIST HAS BEEN INTRODUCED OFTEN ENOUGH INTO FICTION AND MANY SCHOLARS HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO WRITE HIS LIFE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN LIGHTS BUT FEW PERHAPS HAVE EVER ATTEMPTED TO PRESENT HIM TO US BEREFT OF ALL THOSE CHARACTERISTICS WHICH A LACK OF THE SENSE OF HARMONY HAS ATTACHED TO HIS PERSON THROUGH THE AGES IN WHICH HIS DOCTRINES HAVE BEEN TAUGHT
MANY HEAVY THINGS ARE THERE FOR THE SPIRIT THE STRONG LOAD-BEARING SPIRIT IN WHICH REVERENCE DWELLETH
THIS IS A POETICAL EPITOME OF SOME OF THE SCATHING CRITICISM OF SCHOLARS WHICH APPEARS IN THE FIRST OF THE THOUGHTS OUT OF SEASON"--THE POLEMICAL PAMPHLET WRITTEN IN 1873 AGAINST DAVID STRAUSS AND HIS SCHOOL
HERE THERE IS MUCH CONCEALED MISERY THAT WISHETH TO SPEAK MUCH EVENING MUCH CLOUD MUCH DAMP AIR
IN VERSE 19 WE ARE TOLD WHAT NIETZSCHE CALLED REDEMPTION--THAT IS TO SAY THE ABILITY TO SAY OF ALL THAT IS PAST
IT IS NOT YOUR SIN--IT IS YOUR SELF-SATISFACTION THAT CRIETH UNTO HEAVEN
AND THEN DID CLOUD AFTER CLOUD ROLL OVER THE SPIRIT UNTIL AT LAST MADNESS PREACHED
WHATEVER I CREATE AND HOWEVER MUCH I LOVE IT,--SOON MUST I BE ADVERSE TO IT AND TO MY LOVE
ON EARTH THERE IS NOTHING GREATER THAN I
WHY DOST THOU PRAISE ME
HERE FLY OPEN UNTO THEE ALL BEING'S WORDS AND WORD-CABINETS
THE WILL TO POWER IS THIS FORCE THE INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION IS ONLY ONE OF THE INDIRECT AND MOST FREQUENT RESULTS THEREOF A CERTAIN LACK OF ACUMEN IN PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTIONS AND THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN ENGLAND AT THE TIME DARWIN WROTE MAY BOTH ACCORDING TO NIETZSCHE HAVE INDUCED THE RENOWNED NATURALIST TO DESCRIBE THE FORCES OF NATURE AS HE DID IN HIS ORIGIN OF SPECIES IN VERSES 28 29 AND 30 OF THE SECOND PORTION OF THIS DISCOURSE WE MEET WITH A DOCTRINE WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT SEEMS TO BE MERELY LE MANOIR A L'ENVERS INDEED ONE ENGLISH CRITIC HAS ACTUALLY SAID OF NIETZSCHE THAT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA IS NO MORE THAN A COMPENDIUM OF MODERN VIEWS AND MAXIMS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
WHEN HOWEVER THE KINGS APPROACHED TO HIM HE SAID HALF-ALOUD LIKE ONE SPEAKING ONLY TO HIMSELF
IT IS SO THAT I LIKE THEM
AND THIS IS THE SIGN OF THEIR JEALOUSY--THEY ALWAYS GO TOO FAR
AND ITS EYE SPAKE UNTO ME
SOLEMNLY
FLUTTERING WINGS
HOW THOU SPURNEST NONE FROM THEE NEITHER BEGGARS NOR KINGS
BUT WE AWAITED THEE EVERY MORNING TOOK FROM THEE THINE OVERFLOW AND BLESSED THEE FOR IT
IT KNEW NOT WHERE TO GO AND SUNK INTO THE MIDRIFF
THAT WOULD BE THE HIGHEST THING FOR ME"--SO SAITH YOUR LYING SPIRIT UNTO ITSELF--"TO GAZE UPON LIFE WITHOUT DESIRE AND NOT LIKE THE DOG WITH HANGING-OUT TONGUE
HOW SHE JUST NOW SPEAKETH SOBERLY THIS DRUNKEN POETESS
IN EVENING'S LIMPID AIR WHAT TIME THE DEW'S SOOTHINGS UNTO THE EARTH DOWNPOUR INVISIBLY AND UNHEARD FOR TENDER SHOE-GEAR WEAR THE SOOTHING DEWS LIKE ALL THAT'S KIND-GENTLE
MAY THEY BE DECOYED OUT OF THIS LIFE BY THE LIFE ETERNAL
I HAVE KNOWN NOBLE ONES WHO LOST THEIR HIGHEST HOPE
THE WORLD SLEEPETH AH
WHO IS ZARATHUSTRA TO US
ONE STILL WORKETH FOR WORK IS A PASTIME
AND ON EVERY SCALE GLITTERETH GOLDEN THOU SHALT THE VALUES OF A THOUSAND YEARS GLITTER ON THOSE SCALES AND THUS SPEAKETH THE MIGHTIEST OF ALL DRAGONS
YOU I ADVISE NOT TO WORK BUT TO FIGHT
HE ONCE TOLD ME THAT EVEN AS A CHILD HE HAD DREAMT OF HIM
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AS WELL TO START OUT WITH A BROAD AND RAPID SKETCH OF NIETZSCHE AS A WRITER ON MORALS EVOLUTION AND SOCIOLOGY SO THAT THE READER MAY BE PREPARED TO PICK OUT FOR HIMSELF SO TO SPEAK ALL PASSAGES IN THIS WORK BEARING IN ANY WAY UPON NIETZSCHE'S VIEWS IN THOSE THREE IMPORTANT BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE
IT WAITETH PERHAPS FOR THE FIRST LIGHTNING WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD SAID THIS THE YOUTH CALLED OUT WITH VIOLENT GESTURES
STILL AM I YOUR LOVE'S HEIR AND HERITAGE BLOOMING TO YOUR MEMORY WITH MANY-HUED WILD-GROWING VIRTUES O YE DEAREST ONES
DOTH SHE RUMINATE
ALWAYS ON THE WAY BUT WITHOUT A GOAL ALSO WITHOUT A HOME
CHAPTER LXXX
HERE THE SPIRIT BECOMETH A LION
TO TELL THE TRUTH AND TO AIM STRAIGHT
AND I HAVE SEEN THE TRUTH NAKED VERILY
THOU-SHALT IS THE GREAT DRAGON CALLED
WHO COULD THERE SEEK SUCCESSFULLY FOR GREATNESS
WITH SUCH ENIGMAS AND BITTERNESS IN HIS HEART DID ZARATHUSTRA SAIL O'ER THE SEA
SO DO I TEACH
AND HE WHO CAN WILL NOT
THIS IS A DANCE OVER STOCK AND STONE
THAT IS NOT THE WORST THING FOR ME TO DO
IT IS STILL TOO YOUNG--SO HAVE PATIENCE WITH IT
WE PART HERE
PART III
VERILY IN THOSE HAVE I MINE AMUSEMENT
BUT YE COULD WELL CREATE THE SUPERMAN
AFTER HIS ADDRESS TO THE HIGHER MEN ZARATHUSTRA GOES OUT INTO THE OPEN TO RECOVER HIMSELF
THEIR DEVILS DRAW THEM
THEN HE FELT INCLINED TO QUENCH A LITTLE THIRST AND TO BREAK OFF FOR HIMSELF A CLUSTER OF GRAPES
THE COWARDLY ARE WISE
THEN THEY SIGHED
WELL THEN
WELL THEN
WELL THEN
CERTAINLY IT IS A BIRD'S STOMACH
AND EVEN THE EVILEST IS WORTHY AS SPICING AND AS FINAL OVER-FOAMING OH HOW COULD I NOT BE ARDENT FOR ETERNITY AND FOR THE MARRIAGE-RING OF RINGS--THE RING OF THE RETURN
OUT OF LOVE ALONE SHALL MY CONTEMPT AND MY WARNING BIRD TAKE WING
BECAUSE YE WERE ALWAYS MY DEAREST MY POSSESSION AND MY POSSESSEDNESS
IN ENGLAND WE ALMOST ALWAYS LAUGH WHEN A MAN TAKES HIMSELF SERIOUSLY AT ANYTHING SAVE SPORT
AH WHERE HAVE GONE ALL MY GOODNESS AND ALL MY SHAME AND ALL MY BELIEF IN THE GOOD
OR DO THEY ONLY BELIEVE THE STAMMERER
THAT THEY MAY NOT QUARREL WITH ONE ANOTHER THE GOOD FEMALES
IF YE BELIEVED MORE IN LIFE THEN WOULD YE DEVOTE YOURSELVES LESS TO THE MOMENTARY
HOW FROM A DEEP BREAST THIS STILLNESS FETCHETH PURE BREATH
MARRIAGE
SO HE PLUCKETH THE EARS OF CORN AND IS VEXED
ABIDE WITH US O ZARATHUSTRA
FOR INSTANCE PAR
HE SAYS THERE
FOR THEY AWAKEN DISTRUST IN GREAT THINGS THESE SUBTLE FALSE-COINERS AND STAGE-PLAYERS UNTIL AT LAST THEY ARE FALSE TOWARDS THEMSELVES SQUINT-EYED WHITED CANKERS GLOSSED OVER WITH STRONG WORDS PARADE VIRTUES AND BRILLIANT FALSE DEEDS
AND ALREADY IS A NEW ODOUR DIFFUSED AROUND IT A SALVATION-BRINGING ODOUR--AND A NEW HOPE
THAT DO ALL PHYSICIANS AND POETS KNOW WELL 18
THAT HAST THOU NOW LEARNED
ALL THIS DID ZARATHUSTRA BEHOLD WITH GREAT ASTONISHMENT
OR A FUME AND FRAGRANCE OF ETERNITY
IF MY VIRTUE BE A DANCER'S VIRTUE AND IF I HAVE OFTEN SPRUNG WITH BOTH FEET INTO GOLDEN-EMERALD RAPTURE
AND ARE NOT ALL THINGS CLOSELY BOUND TOGETHER IN SUCH WISE THAT THIS MOMENT DRAWETH ALL COMING THINGS AFTER IT
WHO PUT IT IN THEM
IT IS TIME AND MORE THAN TIME
BUT SO FAR ARE WE FOOLS
OUT OF GLASS COFFINS DID VANQUISHED LIFE GAZE UPON ME
THERE INASMUCH AS THE COMMUNITY IS AN OPPRESSED SUFFERING UNEMANCIPATED AND WEARY ONE ALL THAT WILL BE HELD TO BE GOOD WHICH ALLEVIATES THE STATE OF SUFFERING
NOW IT WAITETH AND WAITETH,--FOR WHAT DOTH IT WAIT
SO LIVE YOUR LIFE OF OBEDIENCE AND OF WAR
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CLASS OF WRITING WHICH MAY BE PASSED OVER TOO LIGHTLY BY THOSE WHOM POETASTERS HAVE MADE DISTRUSTFUL OF POETRY
LIKE THEE MUST I GO DOWN AS MEN SAY TO WHOM I SHALL DESCEND
NEVER ON EARTH LAUGHED A MAN AS HE LAUGHED IN THIS PARABLE THE YOUNG SHEPHERD IS OBVIOUSLY THE MAN OF TO-DAY
IN THE EARTHQUAKE OF OLD PEOPLES NEW FOUNTAINS BURST FORTH
I WAS SEEKING THE PIOUS MAN A SAINT AND AN ANCHORITE WHO ALONE IN HIS FOREST HAD NOT YET HEARD OF WHAT ALL THE WORLD KNOWETH AT PRESENT WHAT DOTH ALL THE WORLD KNOW AT PRESENT ASKED ZARATHUSTRA
YE CANNOT ENDURE IT WITH YOURSELVES AND DO NOT LOVE YOURSELVES SUFFICIENTLY
AND RATHER BE ANGRY THAN ABASH ANY ONE
WHEN YE ARE WILLERS OF ONE WILL AND WHEN THAT CHANGE OF EVERY NEED IS NEEDFUL TO YOU
CRIED I WHO CARRIETH HIS ASHES UNTO THE MOUNTAIN
SUPERFICIAL ARE THEY ALL UNTO ME AND SHALLOW SEAS
EVERYWHERE RESOUNDETH THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO PREACH DEATH
TO MY FRIENDS CAN I AGAIN GO DOWN AND ALSO TO MINE ENEMIES
BUT HE WAITED IN VAIN
AND I WANT WITHAL TO SEE MY BLOOD HONOURED IN THEIRS AND WHEN THEY HAD PASSED A PAIN ATTACKED ZARATHUSTRA
AND MANY SUCH GOOD INVENTIONS ARE THERE THAT THEY ARE LIKE WOMAN'S BREASTS
FOR NOW A CRY OF DISTRESS CALLETH ME HASTILY AWAY FROM THEE
AND NOT IN VAIN DID THE YOUTHS SIT BEFORE THE PREACHER OF VIRTUE
IT IS A TORCH TO LIGHT YOU TO LOFTIER PATHS
AH THAT I WERE NIGHT
OR AN INHERITOR
FOR HE ASKED HIMSELF MANY THINGS AND HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO ANSWER
THE FIELD LIES OPEN BEFORE US
LEFT HIS HOME IN HIS THIRTIETH YEAR WENT INTO THE PROVINCE OF ARIA AND DURING TEN YEARS OF SOLITUDE IN THE MOUNTAINS COMPOSED THE ZEND-AVESTA THE SUN OF KNOWLEDGE STANDS ONCE MORE AT MIDDAY
WITH ANOTHER LOVE SHALL I THEN LOVE YOU
WELL ONE THING IS NOW MORE NECESSARY UNTO ME THAN ALL OTHERS
THEREOF COULD I SING A SONG--AND WILL SING IT
BUT THE CLEAR THE HONEST THE TRANSPARENT--THESE ARE FOR ME THE WISEST SILENT ONES
CONFLICTING MORAL CODES HAVE BEEN NO MORE THAN THE CONFLICTING WEAPONS OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF MEN
THOU THYSELF ONCE DEVISEDST THIS EXPRESSION THE POET AND MAGICIAN WHO AT LAST TURNETH HIS SPIRIT AGAINST HIMSELF THE TRANSFORMED ONE WHO FREEZETH TO DEATH BY HIS BAD SCIENCE AND CONSCIENCE
THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR
THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR
THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR
HAVE I NOT FALLEN--HARK
SUCH PERSONS SIT DOWN TO THE TABLE AND BRING NOTHING WITH THEM NOT EVEN GOOD HUNGER:--AND THEN DO THEY RAIL
HOW DID I SURVIVE AND SURMOUNT SUCH WOUNDS
THREE METAMORPHOSES OF THE SPIRIT HAVE I DESIGNATED TO YOU
WHY IS IT SO LONG NIGHT
THAT MY HAND MAY NOT ENTIRELY LOSE BELIEF IN FIRMNESS
THE LEECH
THE LEECH
THE LEECH
I THE STATE AM THE PEOPLE IT IS A LIE
THOU HAST AWAKENED ME IN TIME
OR AN ANCHORITE WHO HATH LIVED TOO LONG AMONG ROCKS AND TREES
BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT AS THEY STAND I HAVE NOT GIVEN TO THESE NOTES BY ANY MEANS THEIR FINAL FORM
AND WANDERED I ALONE FOR WHAT DID MY SOUL HUNGER BY NIGHT AND IN LABYRINTHINE PATHS
MYSELF HOWEVER AND MY FATE--WE DO NOT TALK TO THE PRESENT NEITHER DO WE TALK TO THE NEVER
AM I A SOOTHSAYER
TO ME HOWEVER DID THE HEART WRITHE WITH LAUGHTER AND WAS LIKE TO BREAK
BY ALL THAT IS LUMINOUS AND STRONG AND GOOD IN THEE O ZARATHUSTRA
BITE MY FISHING-HOOK INTO THE BELLY OF ALL BLACK AFFLICTION
IN THEE STILL LIVETH ALSO THE UNREALISEDNESS OF MY YOUTH
THEY LOSE THEMSELVES ON THEIR WAY
SEE VERSE 33 IN ON THE OLIVE MOUNT AND VERSES 9-10 IN THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE CHAPTER XLIX
AND THE MOST REPUGNANT ANIMAL OF MAN THAT I FOUND DID I CHRISTEN PARASITE
THERE TIME WAS MY SOLE CONTEMPORARY
NOW DO THEY LEARN TO LAUGH AT THEMSELVES
GOLDLIKE BEAMETH THE GLANCE OF THE BESTOWER
AND SELFLESS"--SO DID THEY WISH THEMSELVES WITH GOOD REASON ALL THOSE WORLD-WEARY COWARDS AND CROSS-SPIDERS
4
4
4
4
4

WHY ART THOU FRIGHTENED ON THAT ACCOUNT?--BUT IT IS THE SAME WITH MAN AS WITH THE TREE
BY LITTLE FLYING INSECTS ROUND-SNIFFLED AND ROUND-PLAYED AND ALSO BY YET LITTLER FOOLISHER AND PECCABLER WISHES AND PHANTASIES ENVIRONED BY YOU YE SILENT PRESENTIENTEST MAIDEN-KITTENS DUDU AND SULEIKA ROUNDSPHINXED THAT INTO ONE WORD I MAY CROWD MUCH FEELING
IN TRUTH AS YOUR WISEST DID NOT SEEM TO ME SO VERY WISE SO FOUND I ALSO HUMAN WICKEDNESS BELOW THE FAME OF IT
THAT DELIGHT ALONE HE IS UNWILLING TO FOREGO
THE HIGHER MAN
THE HIGHER MAN
THE HIGHER MAN
THE HIGHER MAN
THE HIGHER MAN
BUT IF SUCH LONGING IN YOU BE ACTUAL IT SEEMETH TO ME NEVERTHELESS TO BE IMPOSSIBLE
ONCE MORE THUS SPAKE THE UGLIEST MAN
O HEAVEN ABOVE ME
IT IS CERTAINLY THE GREATEST FOLLY TO THROW SALT INTO THE SEA AND STATUES INTO THE MUD
BY DESTROYING THESE PARTICULAR INSTINCTS THAT IS TO SAY BY ATTEMPTING TO MASCULINISE WOMAN AND TO FEMINISE MEN WE JEOPARDISE THE FUTURE OF OUR PEOPLE
EVEN THE PEOPLE LEARN FROM THEE AND ACQUIRE FAITH IN THY TEACHING
NOT UPON HIMSELF AND HIS SHADOW,--ALL AT ONCE HE STARTLED AND SHRANK BACK
SAID YE EVER YEA TO ONE JOY
WOULD THAT I WERE WISE FROM THE VERY HEART LIKE MY SERPENT
FOR THE SAKE OF THIS DID I CAST EVERYTHING ELSE ASIDE FOR THE SAKE OF THIS DID EVERYTHING ELSE BECOME INDIFFERENT TO ME
THE WORLD RESEMBLETH MAN IN THAT IT HATH A BACKSIDE,--SO MUCH IS TRUE
IF I MYSELF AM A GRAIN OF THE SAVING SALT WHICH MAKETH EVERYTHING IN THE CONFECTION-BOWL MIX WELL FOR THERE IS A SALT WHICH UNITETH GOOD WITH EVIL
THUS PASSETH THE DAY UNTO THE VIRTUOUS
IT STRETCHETH ITSELF OUT LONG--LONGER
OF WHAT ACCOUNT NOW ARE--THE GODS TO ME THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
OF HIS PITY FOR MAN HATH GOD DIED SO BE YE WARNED AGAINST PITY
IT IS GONE MINE EVIL SPIRIT
AM I A DISHONEST PLAYER?"--FOR HE IS WILLING TO SUCCUMB
COVETOUS OF THE EARTH AND ALL THE JOYS OF LOVERS
VERILY NOT IN BACKWORLDS AND REDEEMING BLOOD-DROPS
HE PRESSED FORWARD AS ONE WHO HAD NO TIME TO LOSE SEIZED ZARATHUSTRA'S HAND AND EXCLAIMED
THE HOUR OF MY DESCENT OF MY DOWN-GOING
THEY WONDER WHY I CAME NOT TO REVILE VENERY AND VICE
ITS FIGHTS AND VICTORIES HERALD ITS COMPANION AND ECHO
AND MY SOUL ALSO IS THE SONG OF A LOVING ONE
IT IS THE KINGDOM OF THE POPULACE
AND HE WHO WOULD KEEP CLEAN AMONGST MEN MUST KNOW HOW TO WASH HIMSELF EVEN WITH DIRTY WATER
THEN SAID THE SOOTHSAYER
YE HAVE MADE YOUR WAY FROM THE WORM TO MAN AND MUCH WITHIN YOU IS STILL WORM
NOW DO I KNOW HOW IT IS CONCERNING THE FIRE-DOG
THEY HERALD THE COMING OF THE LIGHTNING AND SUCCUMB AS HERALDS
NO ONE SPEAKETH UNTO ME
ON YOUR SHOULDERS PRESSETH MANY A BURDEN MANY A RECOLLECTION
HUMAN SOCIETY
IF I BE A DIVINER AND FULL OF THE DIVINING SPIRIT WHICH WANDERETH ON HIGH MOUNTAIN-RIDGES TWIXT TWO SEAS WANDERETH TWIXT THE PAST AND THE FUTURE AS A HEAVY CLOUD--HOSTILE TO SULTRY PLAINS AND TO ALL THAT IS WEARY AND CAN NEITHER DIE NOR LIVE
YOUR REASON YOUR LIKENESS YOUR WILL YOUR LOVE SHALL IT ITSELF BECOME
WITH CHAINS DO I BIND MYSELF TO MAN BECAUSE I AM PULLED UPWARDS TO THE SUPERMAN
AND OTHERS WANT TO BE CAST DOWN,--AND LIKEWISE CALL IT VIRTUE
SO DID IT HAPPEN YESTER-NIGHT AT THE GARDEN-WALL
BREAK BLEED THOU HEART
PROVERBS SHOULD BE PEAKS AND THOSE SPOKEN TO SHOULD BE BIG AND TALL
XLIII
HERE HOWEVER A FOAMING FOOL WITH EXTENDED HANDS SPRANG FORWARD TO HIM AND STOOD IN HIS WAY
LO A RIVER THAT FLOWETH BACK UNTO ITS SOURCE IN MANY WINDINGS FOR HE WANTED TO LEARN WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AMONG MEN DURING THE INTERVAL
26 27
VERILY NOT IN SATIETY SHALL HIS LONGING CEASE AND DISAPPEAR BUT IN BEAUTY
THEY WOULD FAIN BE DEAD AND WE SHOULD APPROVE OF THEIR WISH
IN THIS DISCOURSE NIETZSCHE DISASSOCIATES HIMSELF FINALLY FROM THE HIGHER MEN AND BY THE SYMBOL OF THE LION WISHES TO CONVEY TO US THAT HE HAS WON OVER AND MASTERED THE BEST AND THE MOST TERRIBLE IN NATURE
I LOVE MANKIND WHY SAID THE SAINT DID I GO INTO THE FOREST AND THE DESERT
LITTLE HAD EVER TAKEN PLACE WHEN THY NOISE AND SMOKE PASSED AWAY
THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY
THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY
THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY
BUT I HAVE UNLEARNED THE BELIEF IN GREAT EVENTS WHEN THERE IS MUCH ROARING AND SMOKE ABOUT THEM
UNLEARN I PRAY YOU THIS FOR YE CREATING ONES
ALSO WHAT REQUIRETH A LONG TIME A DAY'S-WORK AND A MOUTH'S-WORK FOR GENTLE IDLERS AND SLUGGARDS
WELCOME HERE WELCOME TO YOU MY GUESTS THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND LAUGHED WITH LOVE AND MISCHIEF
BLAMABLE IS ALL GREAT EXISTENCE EVEN WHEN THOU ART GENTLE TOWARDS THEM THEY STILL FEEL THEMSELVES DESPISED BY THEE
A HALF-ETERNITY
ALWAYS DOTH HE DESTROY WHO HATH TO BE A CREATOR
IF ONE WOULD HAVE A FRIEND THEN MUST ONE ALSO BE WILLING TO WAGE WAR FOR HIM
IN THE FIRST SEVEN VERSES OF THIS DISCOURSE I CANNOT HELP SEEING A GENTLE ALLUSION TO SCHOPENHAUER'S HABITS AS A BON-VIVANT
WITH YOUR VALUES AND FORMULAE OF GOOD AND EVIL YE EXERCISE POWER YE VALUING ONES
I THINK OF YOU TO-DAY AS MY DEAD ONES
UNTO YOUR CHILDREN SHALL YE MAKE AMENDS FOR BEING THE CHILDREN OF YOUR FATHERS
HENCE
HENCE
HENCE
HENCE
HENCE
LAUGH NOT AT SUCH MARRIAGES
DO NOT LET YOURSELVES BE IMPOSED UPON OR PUT UPON
I AM FAVOURABLE TO HIM AND SYMPATHETIC ON ACCOUNT OF HIS MODESTY
HEAREST THOU NOT HOW IT MYSTERIOUSLY FRIGHTFULLY AND CORDIALLY SPEAKETH UNTO THEE THE OLD DEEP DEEP MIDNIGHT
XIV
XIV
THOU WILT READILY DIVINE THAT IN SUCH A SAYING THERE IS WISDOM
AND BEFORE ANY ONE ANSWERED HIM HE HAD SEIZED THE HARP OF THE OLD MAGICIAN CROSSED HIS LEGS AND LOOKED CALMLY AND SAGELY AROUND HIM:--WITH HIS NOSTRILS HOWEVER HE INHALED THE AIR SLOWLY AND QUESTIONINGLY LIKE ONE WHO IN NEW COUNTRIES TASTETH NEW FOREIGN AIR
UNMOVED IS MY DEPTH
TO HIM WHO SEEKETH TO BE JUST FROM THE HEART EVEN THE LIE BECOMETH PHILANTHROPY
THESE HATH NO ONE YET GONE TO THE END OF
THEREBY HATH HE OVERCOME EVERY ANIMAL
CONSEQUENTLY--ITSELF ALSO
COULD YE CONCEIVE A GOD?--BUT LET THIS MEAN WILL TO TRUTH UNTO YOU THAT EVERYTHING BE TRANSFORMED INTO THE HUMANLY CONCEIVABLE THE HUMANLY VISIBLE THE HUMANLY SENSIBLE
SHALL I BEAR FALSE WITNESS
LATE HAST THOU BECOME YOUNG
THREE TIMES NAY
THREE TIMES NAY
THREE TIMES NAY
I AM WEARY OF MY WISDOM LIKE THE BEE THAT HATH GATHERED TOO MUCH HONEY
THEY ALSO KNOW HOW TO PLAY WITH FALSE DICE
AND WHERE THE VICES OF YOUR FATHERS ARE THERE SHOULD YE NOT SET UP AS SAINTS
FREEDOM WILL IT CAPTURE AND LORDSHIP IN ITS OWN WILDERNESS
IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT YE SHOULD RECONCILE WITH HIM WHOM YE SLAY
AND NO CONTRACT
HIS PITY BECOMES SO GREAT THAT HE ACTUALLY DOES SACRIFICE SOMETHING TO US--HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON
IF WE CONDEMN IT WE EITHER GO OVER TO THE PURITANS OR WE JOIN THOSE WHO ARE WONT TO COME TO TABLE WITH NO EDGE TO THEIR APPETITES AND WHO THEREFORE GRUMBLE AT ALL GOOD FARE
THEY MAKE EVERY ONE SUFFER FOR IT THAT THEY NO LONGER RUN SINGLY
ALREADY AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY NUMBERS OF GERMAN PHILOLOGISTS AND PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHERS HAD DENOUNCED HIM AS ONE WHO HAD STRAYED TOO FAR FROM THEIR FLOCK AND HIS LECTURES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BALE WERE DESERTED IN CONSEQUENCE
I WANT HEIRS SO SAITH EVERYTHING THAT SUFFERETH I WANT CHILDREN I DO NOT WANT MYSELF JOY HOWEVER DOTH NOT WANT HEIRS IT DOTH NOT WANT CHILDREN,--JOY WANTETH ITSELF IT WANTETH ETERNITY IT WANTETH RECURRENCE IT WANTETH EVERYTHING ETERNALLY-LIKE-ITSELF
THAT IS THE HAND OF ONE WHO HATH EVER DISPENSED BLESSINGS
ONE THING HOWEVER DO I KNOW,--FROM THYSELF DID I LEARN IT ONCE O ZARATHUSTRA
THEREFORE I LOVE AND CHERISH IT--NOW SITTETH IT BESIDE ME ON ITS GOLDEN EGGS THUS SHOULDST THOU STAMMER AND PRAISE THY VIRTUE
NAKED HAVE I SEEN BOTH OF THEM THE GREATEST AND THE SMALLEST MAN ALL-TOO-SIMILAR ARE THEY STILL TO EACH OTHER
PITY IS NECESSARY,"--SO SAITH A THIRD PARTY
THY SOUL WILL BE DEAD EVEN SOONER THAN THY BODY
THERE WAS I FURTHEST FROM CLOUDY DAMP MELANCHOLY OLD-EUROPE
MINE EGO IS TO ME THE GREAT CONTEMPT OF MAN
I REQUIRE NEW MOUNTAINS
IF ONE HAD THE SMALLEST VESTIGE OF SUPERSTITION IN ONE IT WOULD HARDLY BE POSSIBLE TO SET ASIDE COMPLETELY THE IDEA THAT ONE IS THE MERE INCARNATION MOUTHPIECE OR MEDIUM OF AN ALMIGHTY POWER
WHAT MODERN MEN DESIRE ABOVE ALL IS PEACE AND THE CESSATION OF PAIN
AND WHEN I SAW MY DEVIL I FOUND HIM SERIOUS THOROUGH PROFOUND SOLEMN
AND THIS IS ITS ART
AH WHERE IS THE LYING INNOCENCE WHICH I ONCE POSSESSED THE INNOCENCE OF THE GOOD AND OF THEIR NOBLE LIES
YE YOURSELVES HAVE ADVANCED WITH THE PEOPLE'S SPIRIT AND VIRTUE--AND THE PEOPLE BY YOU
BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1879 WHEN HE FINALLY SEVERED ALL CONNECTION WITH UNIVERSITY WORK THAT HE MAY BE SAID TO HAVE ATTAINED TO THE FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE WHICH STAMP THIS DISCOURSE
AS THE HERON LOOKETH CONTEMPTUOUSLY AT SHALLOW POOLS WITH BACKWARD-BENT HEAD SO DO I LOOK AT THE THRONG OF GREY LITTLE WAVES AND WILLS AND SOULS
BUT IT WAS A BLASPHEMY
VERILY MY BROTHER IF THOU KNEWEST BUT A PEOPLE'S NEED ITS LAND ITS SKY AND ITS NEIGHBOUR THEN WOULDST THOU DIVINE THE LAW OF ITS SURMOUNTINGS AND WHY IT CLIMBETH UP THAT LADDER TO ITS HOPE
AT THEIR GLOOMY SAGES DID I BID THEM LAUGH AND WHOEVER HAD SAT ADMONISHING AS A BLACK SCARECROW ON THE TREE OF LIFE
NIETZSCHE HOWEVER WAS EVIDENTLY NOT SO CONFIDENT ABOUT THIS
YE ARE NOT EAGLES
WHO WOULD PRESERVE IT
DO NOT SPEAK FURTHER THOU CONVALESCENT!"--SO ANSWERED HIS ANIMALS BUT GO OUT WHERE THE WORLD WAITETH FOR THEE LIKE A GARDEN
RATHER WILL I DIE RATHER WILL I DIE THAN SAY UNTO YOU WHAT MY MIDNIGHT-HEART NOW THINKETH
FREE DOST THOU CALL THYSELF
THAT YE MAY AGAIN COME TO LIFE AND THAT VIRTUE--MAY COME TO YOU THUS SPAKE I BEFORE THE FIRE-DOG
YE LONESOME ONES OF TO-DAY YE SECEDING ONES YE SHALL ONE DAY BE A PEOPLE
HERE ARE PRIESTS
THERE ARE TWO FACTORS NAMELY THE NATURE OF THE ORGANISM AND THE NATURE OF THE CONDITIONS
THESE TWO CONFLICTING HALVES IN THE CHARACTER OF THE CHRIST OF THE GOSPELS WHICH NO SOUND PSYCHOLOGY CAN EVER RECONCILE NIETZSCHE ALWAYS KEPT DISTINCT IN HIS OWN MIND
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD SAID THIS HE REMEMBERED THE WORDS OF THE SAINT IN THE FOREST
WHEN HE JUDGED HIMSELF--THAT WAS HIS SUPREME MOMENT
MANY SICKLY ONES HAVE THERE ALWAYS BEEN AMONG THOSE WHO MUSE AND LANGUISH FOR GOD
VERILY THE INDIVIDUAL HIMSELF IS STILL THE LATEST CREATION
WHAT DOTH WILLING ITSELF DEVISE IN ORDER TO GET FREE FROM ITS TRIBULATION AND MOCK AT ITS PRISON
AND NOW HATH HE STRUCK UP AN AWFUL MELANCHOLY AIR
AGAIN TO THE ADULT WHO HAPPENS TO BE AMUSING HIM
WOE HIM WHO DOTH THEM HIDE
WOE HIM WHO DOTH THEM HIDE
THE PEASANT IS AT PRESENT THE BEST
A FOOL ONLY
NOT THE NEIGHBOUR DO I TEACH YOU BUT THE FRIEND
FOR IN ONE'S HEART ONE LOVETH ONLY ONE'S CHILD AND ONE'S WORK
I MAKE FOR MY GOAL I FOLLOW MY COURSE
CALM IS THE BOTTOM OF MY SEA
ART THOU A MAN ENTITLED TO DESIRE A CHILD
THE RABBLE
THE RABBLE
THOU ART YOUNG AND DESIREST CHILD AND MARRIAGE
DID ONE EVER HEAR SUCH SENSIBLE THINGS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF A WISE MAN
THOU?"--SO TAUNTED THEY NAY
A BAD COUNTRY FOR THE HUNGRY SAID HE
IT IS COWARDICE THAT HOLDETH THEM FAST TO THEIR BRANCHES
O ZARATHUSTRA THOU ART NOT FAITHFUL ENOUGH TO ME
LXVII
LXVII
A GOOD ONE
BUT EVEN THE ASTUTEST OF THEM BUYETH HIS WIFE IN A SACK
THE REVERENCE FOR ONE ANOTHER AS THOSE EXERCISING SUCH A WILL CALL I MARRIAGE
ON THE OLIVE-MOUNT
ON THE OLIVE-MOUNT
THEREBY CAN SUCH A ONE NEVERTHELESS GO VERY FAR
BITE
BITE
BITE
YE PREACH PATIENCE WITH WHAT IS EARTHLY
AS IT IS HOWEVER I WILL MAKE LIGHTER OF YOU SINCE I HAVE TO CARRY WHAT IS HEAVY
WHAT IS THE GREAT DRAGON WHICH THE SPIRIT IS NO LONGER INCLINED TO CALL LORD AND GOD
IS BESTOWING NOT A NECESSITY
HE MUST SACRIFICE TO US
IT IS INNOCENTLY CROOKED IT EVER LIETH
OH THAT SOUL WAS ITSELF MEAGRE GHASTLY AND FAMISHED
OF A SICKLY BODY SPEAKETH THE LARCENOUS CRAVING OF THIS SELFISHNESS
AND THERE IS OF COURSE NO REASON WHY THE READER SHOULD NOT BE HILARIOUS.--A CERTAIN GREATNESS IS REQUISITE BOTH IN ORDER TO BE SUBLIME AND TO HAVE REVERENCE FOR THE SUBLIME
A GOD'S MASK HAVE YE HUNG IN FRONT OF YOU YE PURE ONES
NOW THOU PERISHEST BY THY CALLING
YOUR SOULS THEMSELVES DANCE
VERILY I WOULD THAT THEIR MADNESS WERE CALLED TRUTH OR FIDELITY OR JUSTICE
AND IF THEY HAVE LEARNED OF ME TO LAUGH STILL IT IS NOT MY LAUGHTER THEY HAVE LEARNED
AND VERILY I HAVE EVEN HEARD THE FROG CROAK IN IT
AND WHO THEN KNOWETH WHY THY BODY REQUIRETH JUST THY BEST WISDOM
A LITTLE VALIANT NONSENSE SOME DIVINE SERVICE AND ASS-FESTIVAL SOME OLD JOYFUL ZARATHUSTRA FOOL SOME BLUSTERER TO BLOW YOUR SOULS BRIGHT
NOT DEAD COMPANIONS AND CORPSES WHICH I CARRY WITH ME WHERE I WILL
IMPOSSIBILITY
BUT IT IS BAD SLEEPING WITHOUT A GOOD NAME AND A LITTLE TREASURE
AND QUIETLY AND QUICKLY WILL I PUT THY TRUTH UPSIDE DOWN
IN THIS DISCOURSE WE UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE THE IDEAL BUDDHIST IF NOT GAUTAMA BUDDHA HIMSELF
OF DAY THE FOE WITH EVERY STEP IN SECRET THE ROSY GARLAND-HAMMOCKS DOWNSICKLING TILL THEY'VE SUNKEN DOWN NIGHTWARDS FADED DOWNSUNKEN THUS HAD I SUNKEN ONE DAY FROM MINE OWN TRUTH-INSANITY FROM MINE OWN FERVID DAY-LONGINGS OF DAY AWEARY SICK OF SUNSHINE SUNK DOWNWARDS EVENWARDS SHADOWWARDS
THE SUPERMAN IS THE MEANING OF THE EARTH
AND ONLY WHEN THE CLEAR SKY LOOKETH AGAIN THROUGH RUINED ROOFS AND DOWN UPON GRASS AND RED POPPIES ON RUINED WALLS--WILL I AGAIN TURN MY HEART TO THE SEATS OF THIS GOD
WITH THY LAUGHTER WILT THOU FRIGHTEN AND PROSTRATE THEM
I SERVE THOU SERVEST WE SERVE"--SO CHANTETH HERE EVEN THE HYPOCRISY OF THE RULERS--AND ALAS
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE REALISED THE WHOLE HORROR OF THAT LONELINESS TO WHICH PERHAPS ALL GREATNESS IS CONDEMNED
SUCH IS THE NATURE OF LIVING THINGS
THY SUBLIMITY ITSELF WILL FRIGHTEN THEE AS A PHANTOM
THEY HAVE NOT YET BECOME MEN THOSE TERRIBLE ONES
AH THAT I KNEW HOW TO LURE YOU BACK WITH SHEPHERDS FLUTES
WHAT MAY YE BE SEEKING IN MY DOMAIN
XXXVII

ANOTHER MATTER HOWEVER IS FORSAKENNESS
ONCE AGAIN WE FIND NIETZSCHE THOROUGHLY AT EASE IF NOT CHEERFUL AS AN ATHEIST AND SPEAKING WITH VERTIGINOUS DARING OF MAKING CHANCE GO ON ITS KNEES TO HIM
HIDEOUS TO BEHOLD IS HE ON WHOM INJUSTICE PRESSETH ALONE
IF ONLY IT BE AGREEABLE UNTO THEE
A HUNDRED TIMES HITHERTO HATH SPIRIT AS WELL AS VIRTUE ATTEMPTED AND ERRED
THERE COMETH THE TIME WHEN MAN WILL NO LONGER GIVE BIRTH TO ANY STAR
AND THE MORE IT LEARNETH THE MORE DOTH IT FIND TITLES AND HONOURS FOR THE BODY AND THE EARTH
WHETHER THEY BE SERVILE BEFORE GODS AND DIVINE SPURNINGS OR BEFORE MEN AND STUPID HUMAN OPINIONS
ONCE MORE THY ROARING THY MORAL ROARING
WITH SUCH SIGHING AND CHATTERING DO I FLEE FROM THEIR HEATED ROOMS
THUS THEY SERVED LIFE
WE ALSO KNOW TOO LITTLE AND ARE BAD LEARNERS
TO WANT NOTHING ELSE FROM THEM BUT TO BE ALLOWED TO LIE BEFORE THEM AS A MIRROR WITH A HUNDRED FACETS OH YE SENTIMENTAL DISSEMBLERS YE COVETOUS ONES
I GIVE UNTO EVERY ONE MINE OWN
BUT IT IS THEIR PITY THEIR PITY IS IT FROM WHICH I FLEE AWAY AND FLEE TO THEE
AND OUT OF THE MIDST OF SUPERABUNDANCE IT IS DELIGHTFUL TO LOOK OUT UPON DISTANT SEAS
TO THAT WHALE FISHLIKE IF IT THUS FOR ITS GUEST'S CONVENIENCE MADE THINGS NICE!--(YE WELL KNOW SURELY MY LEARNED ALLUSION HAIL TO ITS BELLY IF IT HAD E'ER A SUCH LOVELIEST OASIS-BELLY AS THIS IS
VERILY UNTO SUCH A SPIRIT IT IS PREYING AND THE WORK OF A BEAST OF PREY
LOVE EVER YOUR NEIGHBOUR AS YOURSELVES--BUT FIRST BE SUCH AS LOVE THEMSELVES SUCH AS LOVE WITH GREAT LOVE SUCH AS LOVE WITH GREAT CONTEMPT THUS SPEAKETH ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS BUT WHY TALK I WHEN NO ONE HATH MINE EARS
THEY REJOICE IF ONCE THOU BE HUMBLE ENOUGH TO BE FRIVOLOUS
THE SOOTHSAYER
THE SOOTHSAYER
THE SOOTHSAYER
AND HOW COULD I ENDURE TO BE A MAN IF MAN WERE NOT ALSO THE COMPOSER AND RIDDLE-READER AND REDEEMER OF CHANCE
SPIT ON THE GREAT CITY WHICH IS THE GREAT SLUM WHERE ALL THE SCUM FROTHETH TOGETHER
FREE FROM WHAT
FREE FROM WHAT
HESITATING LIKE THE CASCADE WHICH HESITATETH EVEN IN ITS LEAP:--THUS DO I HUNGER FOR WICKEDNESS
TO ANOTHER IT IS THE FLIGHT FROM THE SICK ONES




ONE MUST DISCONTINUE BEING FEASTED UPON WHEN ONE TASTETH BEST
TO LEARN TO LOOK AWAY FROM ONESELF IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO SEE MANY THINGS:--THIS HARDINESS IS NEEDED BY EVERY MOUNTAIN-CLIMBER
ITS COURSE WILL IT GO UPON MY FEET MINE OLD WILL
WOMAN HOWEVER IS MEAN
WHAT WOULD BE THY HAPPINESS IF THOU HADST NOT THOSE FOR WHOM THOU SHINEST
IN PARAGRAPH 3 OF THE DISCOURSE WE READ ZARATHUSTRA'S HEALTHY EXHORTATION TO HIS DISCIPLES TO BECOME INDEPENDENT THINKERS AND TO FIND THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY LEARN ANY MORE FROM HIM SEE NOTES ON CHAPTERS LVI PAR
INDEED I BROKE THE MARRIAGE BUT FIRST DID THE MARRIAGE BREAK--ME
I PASS THROUGH THIS PEOPLE AND LET FALL MANY WORDS
AND WHEN THOU WARNEDST ME--WHY DIDST THOU NOT WARN THYSELF
BUT IT BREATHETH WARMLY--I FEEL IT
YEA ZARATHUSTRA THOU SPEAKEST THE TRUTH
KNOWEST THOU IT NOT O ZARATHUSTRA
SO THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THEIR TRAFFICKING MIGHT REMAIN STRANGE UNTO ME AND THEIR BARGAINING FOR POWER
WRITE WITH BLOOD AND THOU WILT FIND THAT BLOOD IS SPIRIT
BUT THY BAD IMPULSES ALSO THIRST FOR FREEDOM
WHAT IS HEAVY
IF THOU MUST BE A SERVANT SEEK HIM UNTO WHOM THY SERVICE IS MOST USEFUL
THERE IS COMRADESHIP
WHERE MINE HONESTY CEASETH SAYS THE TRUE SCIENTIFIC SPECIALIST THERE AM I BLIND AND WANT ALSO TO BE BLIND
THEY SIT FOR LONG EVENINGS BESIDE ONE ANOTHER AND SAY
HOW COULD THEY--BE JUST TOWARDS ME
YE SHALL LOVE PEACE AS A MEANS TO NEW WARS AND THE SHORT PEACE MORE THAN THE LONG NO ONE EVER SPAKE SUCH WARLIKE WORDS
IT HATH MORE FORCE HOW CONFIDENTLY DID MY DREAM CONTEMPLATE THIS FINITE WORLD NOT NEW-FANGLEDLY NOT OLD-FANGLEDLY NOT TIMIDLY NOT ENTREATINGLY AS IF A BIG ROUND APPLE PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY HAND A RIPE GOLDEN APPLE WITH A COOLLY-SOFT VELVETY SKIN:--THUS DID THE WORLD PRESENT ITSELF UNTO ME AS IF A TREE NODDED UNTO ME A BROAD-BRANCHED STRONG-WILLED TREE CURVED AS A RECLINE AND A FOOT-STOOL FOR WEARY TRAVELLERS
IT IS ALL POVERTY AND POLLUTION AND WRETCHED SELF-COMPLACENCY THE HOUR WHEN YE SAY
HE SAW WHAT MODERN ANARCHISTS AND REVOLUTIONISTS DO NOT SEE--NAMELY THAT MAN IS IN DANGER OF ACTUAL DESTRUCTION WHEN HIS CUSTOMS AND VALUES ARE BROKEN
BEYOND ALL THESE DO I LOOK AS A DOG LOOKETH OVER THE BACKS OF THRONGING FLOCKS OF SHEEP
AMEN
AMEN
AMEN
AMEN
MY FRIENDS THAT HATH HITHERTO BEEN MAN'S BEST CONTEMPLATION
BUT COME BACK
ATTEMPTING WITH INTELLIGENCE IT EXALTETH ITSELF
O ZARATHUSTRA PROTECT ME THOU MY LAST REFUGE THOU SOLE ONE WHO DIVINEDST ME
AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF NIETZSCHE'S INTERPRETATION OF LIFE IS DISCLOSED IN THIS DISCOURSE
IT IS AUTUMN ALL AROUND AND CLEAR SKY AND AFTERNOON
AFTER THIS GREETING HIS GUESTS BOWED ONCE MORE AND WERE REVERENTIALLY SILENT
IT IS NOT TO BE A GUIDE-POST FOR ME TO SUPEREARTHS AND PARADISES
LXIV

NOW DO I BID YOU LOSE ME AND FIND YOURSELVES
LET US WAIVE THE QUESTION OF THE SOUL I MIGHT OFTEN HAVE BEEN SEEN DANCING IN THOSE DAYS
THIS IS THY MOST UNPARDONABLE OBSTINACY
FOR ONE'S NEIGHBOUR IS THE VIRTUE ONLY OF THE PETTY PEOPLE
IT MAY COME PERHAPS OUT OF A BLACK SEA
TO BE SURE HE NOW RESTETH BUT HE HATH NOT YET TAKEN REST IN THE SUNSHINE
AND MINE OWN HATRED HAVE I EVEN HATED BECAUSE IT TAINTED THEE
FREEDOM DO I LOVE AND THE AIR OVER FRESH SOIL
5 HIGHER MAN CHAPTER LX
NOW HOWEVER HAVE I TAUGHT YOU TO SAY SUPERMAN
IN HIS PRIVATE NOTES ON THE SUBJECT THE AUTHOR USES THE EXPRESSION SUPERMAN ALWAYS IN THE SINGULAR BY-THE-BYE AS SIGNIFYING THE MOST THOROUGHLY WELL-CONSTITUTED TYPE AS OPPOSED TO MODERN MAN
BLESSED ARE THOSE DROWSY ONES
WHERE THERE IS WILL TO PROCREATION
AND HOWEVER HIGH BE THY HEIGHT MANY OF THEM MUST RISE UP TO THEE
WHAT IS THE REVENGE ON THE WITNESS
YE ENIGMA-ENJOYERS
THEY EXCITE THE SPLEEN
IT HURTETH YOUR GOOD PEOPLE YE TELL ME
LO WHAT FULLNESS IS AROUND US
A PERSON PUTTING A GLASS TO HIS EYES COULD EVEN RECOGNISE FURTHER A SMALL ENVIOUS COUNTENANCE AND ALSO THAT A BLOATED SOULLET DANGLED AT THE STALK
WHAT'S THAT TO ME
WHEN WILT THOU DRINK MY SOUL BACK INTO THEE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND ROSE FROM HIS COUCH BESIDE THE TREE AS IF AWAKENING FROM A STRANGE DRUNKENNESS
O MY SOUL I RESTORED TO THEE LIBERTY OVER THE CREATED AND THE UNCREATED
DISGUST!--THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND SIGHED AND SHUDDERED
NOW HATH IT BECOME THY LAST REFUGE WHAT WAS HITHERTO THY LAST DANGER
O LONESOMENESS
THROUGH FEAR THERE GREW ALSO MY VIRTUE THAT IS TO SAY
AH I AM SAD ALONG WITH THEE THOU DUSKY MONSTER AND ANGRY WITH MYSELF EVEN FOR THY SAKE
WHY LOOK'ST THOU HITHER OF HUMAN PAIN NOT WEARY WITH MISCHIEF-LOVING GODLY FLASH-GLANCES
CHURCHES THEY CALL THEIR SWEET-SMELLING CAVES
AWAY AWAY FROM ME CRIED HE ONCE MORE AND HEAVED HIS STICK AT THE FOND BEGGAR WHO HOWEVER RAN NIMBLY AWAY
THEREFORE THE SHEPHERDS CALLED THIS VALLEY
I HOWEVER SAY UNTO YOU
O ETERNAL EVERYWHERE O ETERNAL NOWHERE O ETERNAL--IN-VAIN THUS SPAKE THE SHADOW AND ZARATHUSTRA'S COUNTENANCE LENGTHENED AT HIS WORDS
ALL LUSTS AND VICES ARE HERE AT HOME
ALMOST HAST THOU HURT OUR REVERENCE
FOR THE LAST TIME HAVE I SPOKEN UNTO THE DEAD
FOR THERE HAD TEN LEECHES BITTEN INTO IT
CLEVER ARE THEY--THEY HAVE DEXTEROUS FINGERS
THEN DID HE LOOK ON THE GREAT CITY AND SIGHED AND WAS LONG SILENT
THIS IS DOUBTLESS A REFERENCE TO A FACT WHICH IS TOO OFTEN NOTICEABLE IN THE CASE OF SO MANY OF THE WORLD'S GIANTS IN ART SCIENCE OR RELIGION
HARD OF HEART IS ITS NATURE AND INVULNERABLE
HEAR NOW AND SEE YE HIGHER MEN WHAT DEVIL--MAN OR WOMAN--THIS SPIRIT OF EVENING-MELANCHOLY IS THUS SPAKE THE OLD MAGICIAN LOOKED CUNNINGLY ABOUT HIM AND THEN SEIZED HIS HARP
FOR WITH ZARATHUSTRA EVEN A KING MAY BE A COOK THIS PROPOSAL APPEALED TO THE HEARTS OF ALL OF THEM SAVE THAT THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR OBJECTED TO THE FLESH AND WINE AND SPICES
TWO
IT IS TIME BUT I--HEARD NOT UNTIL AT LAST MINE ABYSS MOVED AND MY THOUGHT BIT ME
HEAREST THOU
HAPPINESS--HOW INDEED COULD ONE FIND HAPPINESS AMONG SUCH BURIED-ALIVE AND SOLITARY ONES
GOOD SLEEP THEY SOUGHT FOR THEMSELVES AND POPPY-HEAD VIRTUES TO PROMOTE IT
A PLACE OF CONFINEMENT AT ITS WORST IS REAL
AH THERE IS THIRST IN ME
MANY A MISCHIEVOUS DWARF SQUATTETH IN YOUR CORNERS
HAIL TO US
THE GREATEST EVENTS--ARE NOT OUR NOISIEST BUT OUR STILLEST HOURS
ONE DAY WILL THY PRIDE YIELD AND THY COURAGE QUAIL
HEROISM FOILED THWARTED AND WRECKED HOPING AND FIGHTING UNTIL THE LAST IS AT LENGTH OVERTAKEN BY DESPAIR AND RENOUNCES ALL STRUGGLE FOR SLEEP
HE ACCUSES SUCH IDEALISTS OF HYPOCRISY AND GUILE
IF THE PROCESS BE A FACT
ASK WOMEN
THE PRINCE PROPOSETH BUT THE SHOPMAN--DISPOSETH
HE DISLIKETH ME
VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU
WHAT IS THE HIGHEST OF ALL SPECIES OF BEING AND WHAT IS THE LOWEST
HOSTILE TO ALL SUCH TRUTHFULNESS-STATUES IN EVERY DESERT HOMELIER THAN AT TEMPLES WITH CATTISH WANTONNESS THROUGH EVERY WINDOW LEAPING QUICKLY INTO CHANCES EVERY WILD FOREST A-SNIFFING GREEDILY-LONGINGLY SNIFFING THAT THOU IN WILD FORESTS MONG THE MOTLEY-SPECKLED FIERCE CREATURES SHOULDEST ROVE SINFUL-SOUND AND FINE-COLOURED WITH LONGING LIPS SMACKING BLESSEDLY MOCKING BLESSEDLY HELLISH BLESSEDLY BLOODTHIRSTY ROBBING SKULKING LYING--ROVING OR UNTO EAGLES LIKE WHICH FIXEDLY LONG ADOWN THE PRECIPICE LOOK ADOWN THEIR PRECIPICE OH HOW THEY WHIRL DOWN NOW THEREUNDER THEREIN TO EVER DEEPER PROFOUNDNESS WHIRLING THEN SUDDEN WITH AIM ARIGHT WITH QUIVERING FLIGHT ON LAMBKINS POUNCING HEADLONG DOWN SORE-HUNGRY FOR LAMBKINS LONGING FIERCE GAINST ALL LAMB-SPIRITS FURIOUS-FIERCE ALL THAT LOOK SHEEPLIKE OR LAMBEYED OR CRISP-WOOLLY GREY WITH LAMBSHEEP KINDLINESS
VALUING IS CREATING
OH HOW CAN I STILL ENDURE TO LIVE
IS IT NOT WITH THE GOOD AND JUST
O ZARATHUSTRA
THE HOUR HATH COME FOR ALL LIGHT-DREADING PEOPLE THE VESPER HOUR AND LEISURE HOUR WHEN THEY DO NOT--"TAKE LEISURE I HEAR IT AND SMELL IT
TO LIVE AS I INCLINE OR NOT TO LIVE AT ALL
I COUNSEL YOU TO INNOCENCE IN YOUR INSTINCTS
AND NOW YE UPBRAID ME FOR TEACHING THAT THERE IS NO REWARD-GIVER NOR PAYMASTER
AND THE REASON IS THAT I AM ENVIOUS OF THY WISDOM
EVERY SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS ACCORDING TO THEM WAS PRESIDED OVER BY A PROPHET
FOR PROPERLY SPEAKING THERE IS NO TIME ON EARTH FOR SUCH THINGS MEANWHILE HOWEVER THE HIGHER MEN HAD AWAKENED IN ZARATHUSTRA'S CAVE AND MARSHALLED THEMSELVES FOR A PROCESSION TO GO TO MEET ZARATHUSTRA AND GIVE HIM THEIR MORNING GREETING
SO WISHETH ALSO THE HOLIEST
BELIEF IN HIM
GOD'S ADVOCATE AM I WITH THE DEVIL
ALL THE PAST SHALL YE THUS REDEEM
A VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY IS ENUNCIATED IN THE FIRST VERSE OF THIS PARAGRAPH
THUS SANG THE MAGICIAN
I SAY UNTO YOU
WE LIVED THROUGH OUR MORNING WITH BUT ONE MASTER--CHANCE
NOT YET HAD HE LEARNED LAUGHING AND BEAUTY
MY SIGHING SAT ON ALL HUMAN GRAVES AND COULD NO LONGER ARISE
IT WAS NOT HOWEVER FAR FROM MIDNIGHT
FOR IT IS A REASON OF THIS WORLD,--THEREBY WILT THOU LEARN THYSELF TO RENOUNCE THE WORLD SHATTER SHATTER O MY BRETHREN THOSE OLD TABLES OF THE PIOUS
HIM WHO NOW TURNETH SICK THE EVIL OVERTAKETH WHICH IS NOW THE EVIL
VERILY I REVILED WHEN I SPAKE OF PITCH
INGENIOUS IN LITTLE ARTIFICES THEY WAIT FOR THOSE WHOSE KNOWLEDGE WALKETH ON LAME FEET,--LIKE SPIDERS DO THEY WAIT
I LIKE TO LIE HERE WHERE THE CHILDREN PLAY BESIDE THE RUINED WALL AMONG THISTLES AND RED POPPIES
BUT IT IS THE PESSIMISM OF THE HERO--THE MAN MOST SUSCEPTIBLE OF ALL TO DESPERATE VIEWS OF LIFE OWING TO THE OBSTACLES THAT ARE ARRAYED AGAINST HIM IN A WORLD WHERE MEN OF HIS KIND ARE VERY RARE AND ARE CONTINUALLY BEING SACRIFICED
FROM THE DEPTH HOWEVER THERE CAME UP SLOWLY THE SOUND OF A CLOCK-BELL
AT LAST HOWEVER HIS EYES OPENED AND AMAZEDLY HE GAZED INTO THE FOREST AND THE STILLNESS AMAZEDLY HE GAZED INTO HIMSELF
NIETZSCHE TEACHES THAT NOTHING IS STABLE,--NOT EVEN VALUES,--NOT EVEN THE CONCEPTS GOOD AND EVIL
WHAT DO THESE HOUSES MEAN
THERE IS THUNDER ENOUGH TO MAKE THE VERY GRAVES LISTEN
AND THAT IS YOUR SECRET LOVE AND THE SPARKLING TREMBLING AND OVERFLOWING OF YOUR SOULS
THE WORLD IS DEEP AND DEEPER THAN THE DAY COULD READ
TRIUMPHANTLY AND WITH FIRM FOOT DID HE AGAIN ACCEPT HIS FATE
THOSE REPRESENTERS THE PEOPLE CALL GREAT MEN
THE CHILDHOOD OF MANKIND IS OVER
NOW HOWEVER AM I OUT OF SERVICE WITHOUT MASTER AND YET NOT FREE
THUS IS HIS HEAD ONLY THE BOWELS OF HIS HEART
I AM BRINGING GIFTS UNTO MEN GIVE THEM NOTHING SAID THE SAINT
DAY'S-WORK
DAY'S-WORK
AH A FOOL BECOMETH EVERY PRISONER
I TAUGHT THEM ALL MY POETISATION AND ASPIRATION
FOR THE GREAT DESPISERS ARE THE GREAT REVERERS
AND YET IN SPITE OF IT ALL AND AS IF IN DEMONSTRATION OF MY BELIEF THAT EVERYTHING DECISIVE COMES TO LIFE IN SPITE OF EVERY OBSTACLE IT WAS PRECISELY DURING THIS WINTER AND IN THE MIDST OF THESE UNFAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MY ZARATHUSTRA ORIGINATED
FOR EVERY ONE BECOMETH COURAGEOUS WHO BEHOLDETH A DESPAIRING ONE
I TELL YOU YOUR VERY SELF WANTETH TO DIE AND TURNETH AWAY FROM LIFE
BUT THOU FEAREST AND RUNNEST UNTO THY NEIGHBOUR
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE
O MY SOUL I HAVE GIVEN THEE EVERYTHING AND ALL MY HANDS HAVE BECOME EMPTY BY THEE:--AND NOW
WHOEVER READS HIS POSTHUMOUSLY PUBLISHED WRITINGS FOR THE YEARS 1869-82 WITH CARE WILL CONSTANTLY MEET WITH PASSAGES SUGGESTIVE OF ZARATHUSTRA'S THOUGHTS AND DOCTRINES
VERILY NO ABODES DO WE HERE KEEP READY FOR THE IMPURE
TO THEM IT MATTERS NOT IN WHAT SHAPE OR CONDITION MAN BE PRESERVED PROVIDED ONLY HE SURVIVE
AND VERILY TOWARDS THY MOUNTAIN AND THY TREE DO MANY EYES TURN TO-DAY
WOE WOE TO THE SEEKING ONES!"--THUS HATH IT ECHOED THROUGH ALL TIME
XXI

TIS NIGHT
TIS NIGHT
TIS NIGHT
TIS NIGHT
TIS NIGHT
TIS NIGHT
AMONG THE HIGHER MEN WHOM ZARATHUSTRA WISHES TO SAVE IS ALSO THE SCIENTIFIC SPECIALIST--THE MAN WHO HONESTLY AND SCRUPULOUSLY PURSUES HIS INVESTIGATIONS AS DARWIN DID IN ONE DEPARTMENT OF KNOWLEDGE
FOR AS THE PROVERB OF ZARATHUSTRA SAITH
HIS MARRIAGE HE CALLETH IT
HIS MARRIAGE HE CALLETH IT
RATHER WOULDST THOU RUN INTO THE FOREST AND LAY SNARES FOR EVIL BEASTS
INTO HIS SUN
WHY DOST THOU BELIEVE IT THE DISCIPLE ANSWERED
THIS TREE STANDETH LONELY HERE ON THE HILLS
THIS IS COMPLEMENTARY TO THE FIRST THREE VERSES OF PAR
ALAS MUCH IGNORANCE AND ERROR HATH BECOME EMBODIED IN US
HE WHO HATH EARS TO HEAR LET HIM HEAR 2
BUT DO I BID YOU BECOME PHANTOMS OR PLANTS
WITH MUMMIES SOME FALL IN LOVE
THEY ALSO ABSTAIN FROM ALL HEAVY THOUGHTS WHICH INFLATE THE HEART WELL SAID ZARATHUSTRA THOU SHOULDST ALSO SEE MINE ANIMALS MINE EAGLE AND MY SERPENT,--THEIR LIKE DO NOT AT PRESENT EXIST ON EARTH
NOR METHINKETH HATH THY STOMACH EITHER
IS CHASTITY NOT FOLLY
EVERY MOMENT BEGINNETH EXISTENCE AROUND EVERY HERE ROLLETH THE BALL THERE THE MIDDLE IS EVERYWHERE
THE THOUSAND AND ONE GOALS
THE THOUSAND AND ONE GOALS
THE THOUSAND AND ONE GOALS
WHY DID WE EVER GO ON THE WAY
I AM ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS WHO SAITH
FOR HE SEEKETH HIS OWN DOWN-GOING
THE DISGUST DEPARTETH FROM THESE HIGHER MEN
JOYS WANT THE ETERNITY OF ALL THINGS THEY WANT DEEP PROFOUND ETERNITY
AS YET HATH HIS GUSHING PASSION NOT BECOME CALM IN BEAUTY
ALL SPECIES MUST NOT AND CANNOT VALUE ALIKE FOR WHAT IS THE LION'S GOOD IS THE ANTELOPE'S EVIL AND VICE VERSA
HIS SOUL HOWEVER REJOICED UNCEASINGLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE NIGHNESS OF HIS RETURN HOME
THE VERY CLOUD WHICH I SEE BENEATH ME THE BLACKNESS AND HEAVINESS AT WHICH I LAUGH--THAT IS YOUR THUNDER-CLOUD
TOO UNSLEPT HATH THY SEEKING MADE THEE AND TOO WAKEFUL
THEY YIELD THOSE GOOD ONES THEY SUBMIT THEMSELVES
BREAK UP BREAK UP FOR ME THE TABLES OF THE NEVER-JOYOUS ONES
THERE THEY LAUGH
AND HERE CAME THE SOOTHSAYER UNTO ME AND HERE HEARD I FIRST THE CRY WHICH I HEARD JUST NOW THE GREAT CRY OF DISTRESS
ON THAT ACCOUNT GRUMBLETH MY STERN HOUSE-MATE
FOR IT SAITH
FOR IT SAITH
THEN EVERYTHING BECOMETH FALSE AND DISTORTED AND MONSTROUS
BLACK ON THY BACK IS THY TRIANGLE AND SYMBOL
LET YOUR WORK BE A FIGHT LET YOUR PEACE BE A VICTORY
NOW DO ALL SONGS OF LOVING ONES AWAKE
FOR FAILURES LONGETH ALL ETERNAL JOY
A HARD GUEST IS HE,--BUT I HONOUR HIM AND DO NOT WORSHIP LIKE THE TENDERLINGS THE POT-BELLIED FIRE-IDOL
ASKETH THE LOAD-BEARING SPIRIT THAT I MAY TAKE IT UPON ME AND REJOICE IN MY STRENGTH
I AM NOT WORTHY EVEN TO SUCCUMB BY IT THEN WAS THERE AGAIN SPOKEN UNTO ME WITHOUT VOICE
AND HIM WHOM YE DO NOT TEACH TO FLY TEACH I PRAY YOU--TO FALL FASTER 21
AND VERILY WE SPAKE AND THOUGHT LONG ENOUGH TOGETHER ERE ZARATHUSTRA CAME HOME TO HIS CAVE FOR ME NOT TO BE UNAWARE THAT WE ARE DIFFERENT
CHAPTER IX
AND VERILY MANY A CHANCE CAME IMPERIOUSLY UNTO ME
THE FIRST MORALITY IS ACTIVE CREATIVE DIONYSIAN
THOU SWEET ROMP DOST ANNOY
VERILY YE WILL HAVE TO DRAG HIM INTO HIS HEAVEN BY THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD--THIS HERO
SEEST THOU NOT OWLS AND BATS IN FLUTTERING FRAY
AFTER THREE DAYS HOWEVER THERE CAME THE STORY OF THE SHIP'S CREW IN ADDITION TO THIS UNEASINESS--AND THEN DID ALL THE PEOPLE SAY THAT THE DEVIL HAD TAKEN ZARATHUSTRA
WORDS LIKE ALL OTHER MANIFESTATIONS OF AN EVOLVING RACE ARE STAMPED WITH THE VALUES THAT HAVE LONG BEEN PARAMOUNT IN THAT RACE
COURAGEOUS UNCONCERNED SCORNFUL COERCIVE--SO WISDOM WISHETH US
NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT VERSES 9 10 11 AND 12 REFER TO THE GREEKS THE PERSIANS THE JEWS AND THE GERMANS RESPECTIVELY
O MY SOUL I WASHED THE PETTY SHAME AND THE BY-PLACE VIRTUE FROM THEE AND PERSUADED THEE TO STAND NAKED BEFORE THE EYES OF THE SUN
BUT WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK MORE CLEARLY
IT IS TIME NOW FOR US TO SEE HIM AND ALL THE PEOPLE LAUGHED AT ZARATHUSTRA
THE GRAVE-DIGGERS DIG FOR THEMSELVES DISEASES
XXXVIII
XXXVIII
UP ABYSMAL THOUGHT OUT OF MY DEPTH
FOR I WISH TO HEAR THEE
BUT THEY CHANGED AT LAST INTO BIRDS AND CHARMING SONGSTRESSES
FROM THENCE HATH RESULTED THEIR RUINED STOMACH FOR A RUINED STOMACH IS THEIR SPIRIT
I LOVE THOSE WHO DO NOT FIRST SEEK A REASON BEYOND THE STARS FOR GOING DOWN AND BEING SACRIFICES BUT SACRIFICE THEMSELVES TO THE EARTH THAT THE EARTH OF THE SUPERMAN MAY HEREAFTER ARRIVE
YOUR DILIGENCE IS FLIGHT AND THE WILL TO SELF-FORGETFULNESS
INAUDIBLY IT REVOLVETH
WHERE YOUR ENTIRE LOVE IS NAMELY WITH YOUR CHILD THERE IS ALSO YOUR ENTIRE VIRTUE
UNCOMELY GOETH HE THROUGH THE WORLD
THUS WOULD I HAVE IT THE IN ABILITY TO SAY THIS AND THE RESENTMENT WHICH RESULTS THEREFROM HE REGARDS AS THE SOURCE OF ALL OUR FEELINGS OF REVENGE AND ALL OUR DESIRES TO PUNISH--PUNISHMENT MEANING TO HIM MERELY A EUPHEMISM FOR THE WORD REVENGE INVENTED IN ORDER TO STILL OUR CONSCIENCES
WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FROM THE BEGINNING
OUR FLESH IS TENDER OUR SKIN IS ONLY LAMBS SKIN:--HOW COULD WE NOT EXCITE OLD IDOL-PRIESTS
OF A POET AND FOOL--THE BLESSEDNESS IN EVENING'S LIMPID AIR WHAT TIME THE MOON'S SICKLE GREEN TWIXT THE PURPLE-GLOWINGS AND JEALOUS STEAL'TH FORTH
YET HAD HE NOT GONE A HUNDRED STEPS WHEN THERE STOLE A MAN UP TO HIM AND WHISPERED IN HIS EAR--AND LO
ARE YE NOT VERY RIPE FOR THE SERMON OF DEATH
AWAY WITH THEE THOU BLISSFUL HOUR
AWAY WITH THEE THOU BLISSFUL HOUR
UP WITH THEE FIRE-DOG OUT OF THY DEPTH CRIED I AND CONFESS HOW DEEP THAT DEPTH IS
THE MAGICIAN
THE MAGICIAN
THE MAGICIAN
FOR AT THE SAME MOMENT HAD THE SITTING ONE ALREADY PERCEIVED HIM
THERE STANDETH THE BOAT--THITHER GOETH IT OVER PERHAPS INTO VAST NOTHINGNESS--BUT WHO WILLETH TO ENTER INTO THIS PERHAPS
AND WHEN YE LIE IN THE SUN GRUBBED UP AND BROKEN THEN WILL ALSO YOUR FALSEHOOD BE SEPARATED FROM YOUR TRUTH
THAT NOTHING WILL NOW ANY LONGER SATISFY US HOW COULD WE STILL BE CONTENT WITH THE MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY AFTER SUCH OUTLOOKS AND WITH SUCH A CRAVING IN OUR CONSCIENCE AND CONSCIOUSNESS
HE CREPT INTO MY DIRTIEST CORNERS
OFTEN ALSO DO THEY SHOW THEMSELVES TO THEE AS AMIABLE ONES
HE ENJOYED AND QUAFFED HIS SOLITUDE AND THOUGHT OF GOOD THINGS--FOR HOURS
MAY THEY BECOME CONVALESCENTS AND OVERCOMERS AND CREATE HIGHER BODIES FOR THEMSELVES
SO LEARN TO LAUGH BEYOND YOURSELVES
GENTLE IS ZARATHUSTRA TO THE SICKLY
AND THUS SPAKE I OFTEN TO MYSELF FOR CONSOLATION
IN VERSE 12 OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH WE LEARN HOW HE HIMSELF WOULD FAIN HAVE ABANDONED THE POETICAL METHOD OF EXPRESSION HAD HE NOT KNOWN ONLY TOO WELL THAT THE ONLY CHANCE A NEW DOCTRINE HAS OF SURVIVING NOWADAYS DEPENDS UPON ITS BEING GIVEN TO THE WORLD IN SOME KIND OF ART-FORM
LISTEN
THIS HATH JUST ITS TIME
THE WORLD IS PERFECT
MORALLY ARE THINGS ORDERED ACCORDING TO JUSTICE AND PENALTY
MANY NEVER BECOME SWEET
INAUDIBLY IT REVOLVETH CHAPTER XLI
MINE ANIMALS SHALL SERVE YOU
WHO IS THE SHEPHERD INTO WHOSE THROAT THE SERPENT THUS CRAWLED
THEIR CRYING ALSO HATH REACHED YOUR EARS YE VIRTUOUS ONES
STILL ARE MY CHILDREN VERDANT IN THEIR FIRST SPRING STANDING NIGH ONE ANOTHER AND SHAKEN IN COMMON BY THE WINDS THE TREES OF MY GARDEN AND OF MY BEST SOIL
EVEN AMONG THEM THERE ARE HEROES
THIS WANTONNESS AND FOLLY DID I PUT IN PLACE OF THAT WILL WHEN I TAUGHT THAT IN EVERYTHING THERE IS ONE THING IMPOSSIBLE--RATIONALITY A LITTLE REASON TO BE SURE A GERM OF WISDOM SCATTERED FROM STAR TO STAR--THIS LEAVEN IS MIXED IN ALL THINGS
AND OF MANY A PROUD STRUCTURE RAIN-DROPS AND WEEDS HAVE BEEN THE RUIN
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER REMAINED STANDING AND JUST BESIDE HIM FELL THE BODY BADLY INJURED AND DISFIGURED BUT NOT YET DEAD
WHICH OF US NOW--OWETH THANKS BETTER STILL HOWEVER
ALSO METHINKETH THAT AFTER ALL IT HATH LONGER LEGS THAN MINE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND LAUGHING WITH EYES AND ENTRAILS HE STOOD STILL AND TURNED ROUND QUICKLY--AND BEHOLD HE ALMOST THEREBY THREW HIS SHADOW AND FOLLOWER TO THE GROUND SO CLOSELY HAD THE LATTER FOLLOWED AT HIS HEELS AND SO WEAK WAS HE
THEN DID I HASTE AWAY
THOU ART NOT STONE
THOU GREAT STAR
FOR VAINLY I AT LEAST DID SEARCH FOR THE AMISSING FELLOW-JEWEL NAMELY THE OTHER LEG IN THE SANCTIFIED PRECINCTS NIGH HER VERY DEAREST VERY TENDEREST FLAPPING AND FLUTTERING AND FLICKERING SKIRTING
AT THE FOOT OF MY HEIGHT DO I DWELL
THE CRY OF DISTRESS
THE CRY OF DISTRESS
THE CRY OF DISTRESS
BEHOLD IT COMETH IT IS NIGH THE GREAT NOONTIDE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
THIS LIVING PLANTATION OF MY THOUGHTS AND THIS DAWN OF MY HIGHEST HOPE
AND NOW YE UPBRAID ME AS CHILDREN UPBRAID
AND IN ALL WHO CALL THEMSELVES SINNERS AND BEARERS OF THE CROSS AND PENITENTS DO NOT OVERLOOK THE VOLUPTUOUSNESS IN THEIR PLAINTS AND ACCUSATIONS
FAR TOO LONG HATH THERE BEEN A SLAVE AND A TYRANT CONCEALED IN WOMAN
BUT NOW DOTH YOUR EMASCULATED OGLING PROFESS TO BE CONTEMPLATION AND THAT WHICH CAN BE EXAMINED WITH COWARDLY EYES IS TO BE CHRISTENED BEAUTIFUL OH YE VIOLATORS OF NOBLE NAMES
I AM NOT A BUTTERFLY I AM A DEAD LEAF AND CAN BE OF NO USE TO THEE THIS IS A LIE WHICH IS GOOD TO THE BUTTERFLY FOR IT PRESERVES IT
THOU GRAPE-VINE
FOR STILL WAS THE BLOOD FLOWING DOWN ON THE NAKED ARM OF THE CONSCIENTIOUS ONE
HE WHO HATH OTHER SENTIMENTS GOETH VOLUNTARILY INTO THE MADHOUSE
BUT I ASK YOU
YE WILL YET PERISH BY YOUR MANY SMALL VIRTUES BY YOUR MANY SMALL OMISSIONS AND BY YOUR MANY SMALL SUBMISSIONS
AND THE ANGUISH OF THY JUSTICE IN BEING JUST TO THOSE THAT DISDAIN THEE
AN EAR AS BIG AS A MAN I LOOKED STILL MORE ATTENTIVELY--AND ACTUALLY THERE DID MOVE UNDER THE EAR SOMETHING THAT WAS PITIABLY SMALL AND POOR AND SLIM
WHO SEETH THE ABYSS BUT WITH PRIDE
BUT THEY UNDERSTAND NOT WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF MY MORNING MY STEP--IS NOT FOR THEM THE AWAKENING-CALL
OTHERWISE IT WILL SCREAM TOO LOUDLY THE LITTLE TRUTH GIVE ME WOMAN THY LITTLE TRUTH SAID I
HE ALREADY YIELDETH HE FLEETH THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY MINE OLD ARCH-ENEMY
AH IF ONLY IT BE STILL TRUE TO-DAY
FOR ONCE MORE WILL I GO UNTO MEN
FOR ONCE MORE WILL I GO UNTO MEN
THAT IS THEIR COLDNESS
IN THAT YE HAVE DESPAIRED THERE IS MUCH TO HONOUR
THE FAMOUS WISE ONES
THE FAMOUS WISE ONES
THE FAMOUS WISE ONES
ALL-SATISFIEDNESS WHICH KNOWETH HOW TO TASTE EVERYTHING,--THAT IS NOT THE BEST TASTE
CHAPTER XLVI
AND HE WHO COULD HAVE GIVEN ME PROTECTION--HE IS HIMSELF NO MORE
I DO NOT TREAT MY WARRIORS INDULGENTLY HE SAYS
THERE ARE THOSE WHO PREACH MY DOCTRINE OF LIFE AND ARE AT THE SAME TIME PREACHERS OF EQUALITY AND TARANTULAS
AND WHERE THE MARKET-PLACE BEGINNETH THERE BEGINNETH ALSO THE NOISE OF THE GREAT ACTORS AND THE BUZZING OF THE POISON-FLIES
THE VIRTUOUS
THE VIRTUOUS
ABIDE BY THY CUSTOMS THOU EXCELLENT ONE
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER TURNED SAD AND SAID TO HIS HEART
THEY LAUGH ALSO AT CHASTITY AND ASK
WHAT ARE ASHES AND SMOKE AND HOT DREGS TO HIM
WHETHER IT BE THE PITY OF A GOD OR WHETHER IT BE HUMAN PITY IT IS OFFENSIVE TO MODESTY
WHERE I WILL LOVE AND PERISH THAT AN IMAGE MAY NOT REMAIN MERELY AN IMAGE
AND OUT OF REVERENCE FOR THE GOAL AND THE HEIR HE WILL HANG UP NO MORE WITHERED WREATHS IN THE SANCTUARY OF LIFE
NOT ONLY TO PROPAGATE YOURSELVES ONWARDS BUT UPWARDS--THERETO O MY BRETHREN MAY THE GARDEN OF MARRIAGE HELP YOU
BUT WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO THEE
HOW RICH IS THIS EARTH IN SMALL GOOD PERFECT THINGS IN WELL-CONSTITUTED THINGS
I CARRIED MINE OWN ASHES TO THE MOUNTAIN
IS THE WIND NOT A DOG
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
XLII
ONCE DID MY HAPPINESS ALSO DESCEND TO THE VALLEY THAT IT MIGHT SEEK A LODGING
AND IT IS NOT THOSE WHO LEAD OUT OF DANGER THAT PLEASE YOU BEST BUT THOSE WHO LEAD YOU AWAY FROM ALL PATHS THE MISLEADERS
HE WOULD HAVE WOMAN BECOME EVER MORE WOMAN AND MAN BECOME EVER MORE MAN
IT IS HIS ARTFULNESS THAT SPEAKETH NOT
FOR THAT HOUR DO I NOW WAIT
SWEET LYRE
SWEET LYRE
THUS DOTH IT CAUSE THIRST IN THEE THE CREATING ONE
IF EVER I HAVE LAUGHED WITH THE LAUGHTER OF THE CREATIVE LIGHTNING TO WHICH THE LONG THUNDER OF THE DEED FOLLOWETH GRUMBLINGLY BUT OBEDIENTLY
MUST ONE CLATTER LIKE KETTLEDRUMS AND PENITENTIAL PREACHERS
TAKE WHAT I HAVE
BUT ALTHOUGH THOU SHOULDST DANCE BEFORE ME AND LEAP ALL THY SIDE-LEAPS NO ONE MAY SAY UNTO ME
BUT GRANTING THAT SOME ONE DID SAY IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THAT THE POETS LIE TOO MUCH
THEY HATE YOU BECAUSE THEY ARE UNPRODUCTIVE
THOU STILL SEEKEST FREEDOM
DIVINELY WILL WE STRIVE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER ALAS
BUT THIS WE FORGET ON HEARING TONES
AND JUST AS AT NIGHT WHEN THEY ARE IN BED AND HEAR A MAN ABROAD LONG BEFORE SUNRISE SO THEY ASK THEMSELVES CONCERNING US
YE ARE NOT GREAT ENOUGH NOT TO KNOW OF HATRED AND ENVY
BEFORE SUNRISE
BEFORE SUNRISE
BEFORE SUNRISE
I MAKE HYMNS AND SING THEM
IT HATH FORGOTTEN ME PERHAPS
UNCOMMON IS THE HIGHEST VIRTUE AND UNPROFITING BEAMING IS IT AND SOFT OF LUSTRE
WHERE I HAVE GONE THE WAY IS BAD
AND ZARATHUSTRA ALSO WAS SILENT
BETTER KNOW NOTHING THAN HALF-KNOW MANY THINGS
WHAT SPAKE I OF LOVE
THERE DID HE SIT SHRIVELLED IN HIS CHIMNEY-CORNER FRETTING ON ACCOUNT OF HIS WEAK LEGS WORLD-WEARY WILL-WEARY AND ONE DAY HE SUFFOCATED OF HIS ALL-TOO-GREAT PITY THOU OLD POPE SAID HERE ZARATHUSTRA INTERPOSING HAST THOU SEEN THAT WITH THINE EYES
LET THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING BE DETERMINED ANEW BY YOU
STATED BRIEFLY THE LEADING PRINCIPLE OF THIS NEW SYSTEM OF VALUING WOULD BE
IN ECCO HOMO HE IS CAREFUL TO ENLIGHTEN US CONCERNING THE PRECURSORS AND PREREQUISITES TO THE ADVENT OF THIS HIGHEST TYPE IN REFERRING TO A CERTAIN PASSAGE IN THE GAY SCIENCE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THIS TYPE WE MUST FIRST BE QUITE CLEAR IN REGARD TO THE LEADING PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION ON WHICH IT DEPENDS
AH THIS MAD OLD FOOL WISDOM
STOP THIS CRIED HE TO HIM WITH WRATHFUL LAUGHTER STOP THIS THOU STAGE-PLAYER
BLUSHING UP TO THE VERY ROOTS OF HIS WHITE HAIR HE TURNED ASIDE HIS GLANCE AND RAISED HIS FOOT THAT HE MIGHT LEAVE THIS ILL-STARRED PLACE
ALL ISOLATION IS WRONG
WHATEVER CANNOT OBEY ITSELF IS COMMANDED
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER PUT HIS ARM ABOUT HIM AND LED THE YOUTH AWAY WITH HIM
WISDOM
BUT THAT WILL ITSELF THE WILL TO POWER--THE UNEXHAUSTED PROCREATING LIFE-WILL
AH THAT MAN'S BADDEST IS SO VERY SMALL
THEIR INEXORABLE WILL DO THEY FOLLOW
BUT PRECISELY UNTO HIM CAME THE SHREWDER DISTRUSTERS AND NUT-CRACKERS
OR THY FINGER ONLY
MANY A SHREWD ONE DID I FIND
AND HE WHO CAN BEAR IT SHALL TAKE THE INJUSTICE UPON HIMSELF
THE SILENCE HOWEVER OPPRESSED ME
BOLD
BOLD
AND THE BOWELS OF EXISTENCE DO NOT SPEAK UNTO MAN EXCEPT AS MAN
DO NOT ALL WORDS LIE TO THE LIGHT ONES
I REJOICED WHEN YE SAID TO EACH OTHER
BUT SHARP DIFFERENTIATION ALSO IMPLIES ANTAGONISM IN SOME FORM OR OTHER--HENCE NIETZSCHE'S FEARS FOR MODERN MEN
THEY WILL SOON RAISE THY BARK ALSO AND CARRY THEE AWAY."--THEREUPON WAS ZARATHUSTRA SILENT AND WONDERED.--"DOST THOU STILL HEAR NOTHING CONTINUED THE SOOTHSAYER
THE FRIEND OF THE ANCHORITE IS ALWAYS THE THIRD ONE
MAN IS SOMETHING THAT HATH TO BE SURPASSED
WHY WENTEST THOU NOT INTO THE FOREST
BELIEVEST THOU THAT HE THERE SPAKE THE TRUTH
UNSETTLED AM I IN ALL CITIES AND DECAMPING AT ALL GATES
HE WHO EVER BESTOWETH IS IN DANGER OF LOSING HIS SHAME

END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA BY FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE
OH COME THOU BACK MINE UNFAMILIAR GOD
EVERYTHING FALLETH INTO THE WATER
THUS SHOULD THE HERO REPOSE
JOYS AND PASSIONS
JOYS AND PASSIONS
FOR FIRST MUST THE SIGNS COME UNTO ME THAT IT IS MINE HOUR--NAMELY THE LAUGHING LION WITH THE FLOCK OF DOVES
YOU SHALL ONE BEAT WITH STRIPES
WHAT DOTH MY SIMPLICITY PRETEND TO BESIDE THEIR MULTIPLICITY
BUT WHERE ARE MY BRETHREN WHO WILL CARRY IT WITH ME TO THE VALLEY AND INTO HEARTS OF FLESH THUS DEMANDETH MY GREAT LOVE TO THE REMOTEST ONES
THE PROFOUND MAN WHO IS BY NATURE DIFFERENTIATED FROM HIS FELLOWS FEELS THIS DIFFERENCE TOO KEENLY TO CALL ATTENTION TO IT BY ANY OUTWARD SHOW
TO EXECUTE GREAT THINGS IS DIFFICULT
HE WILL CRY CERTAINLY AND WEEP--BUT HE IS LAUGHABLE EVEN WHEN WEEPING
HE OFTEN THOUGHT OF MAKING THIS FOURTH PART PUBLIC ALSO BUT DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT CONSIDERABLY ALTERING CERTAIN PORTIONS OF IT

THE PARASITE LIVETH WHERE THE GREAT HAVE SMALL SORE-PLACES
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER APPROACHED THEM WITH FRIENDLY MIEN AND SPAKE THESE WORDS
EAGER DID I EVER FIND YOU FOR THE EARTH AMOROUS STILL OF YOUR OWN EARTH-WEARINESS
SWADDLE IT UP AND HOLD ITS MOUTH
YE HIGHER MEN THIS GOD WAS YOUR GREATEST DANGER
GOLD DOTH IT THEN POUR INTO THE SEA OUT OF INEXHAUSTIBLE RICHES SO THAT THE POOREST FISHERMAN ROWETH EVEN WITH GOLDEN OARS
THEIR DREAM STILL DRINKETH AT MY DRUNKEN SONGS
THUS ARE YE ADVOCATES AND JUSTIFIERS OF ALL PERISHABLENESS
HONEST AND TRUTHFUL IN INTELLECTUAL MATTERS HE COULD NOT EVEN THINK THAT MEN ARE EQUAL
NOW DOTH IT WISH TO CONJURE BEFORE YOU IT HATH JUST ITS HOUR
FOR FROST AND WINTER I NOW LONGED
OTHERWISE HOWEVER WOULD THE TARANTULAS HAVE IT
INSPIRED ONES THEY RESEMBLE
YE TREMBLE AT THIS WORD
AND THUS DID THEY SPEAK UNTO ME
4 IS IMPORTANT
MANY A FAREWELL HAVE I TAKEN
ON PASSING-BY
ON PASSING-BY
ON PASSING-BY
HOW INEPTLY COMETH THE WORD VIRTUE OUT OF THEIR MOUTH
IN THE NINTH PARAGRAPH OF THE PROLOGUE FOR INSTANCE IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT HERDSMEN IN THE VERSE HERDSMEN I SAY ETC ETC STANDS FOR ALL THOSE TO-DAY WHO ARE THE ADVOCATES OF GREGARIOUSNESS--OF THE ANT-HILL
SINCE THEN HAVE I LET MYSELF RUN
EVERY ONE WOULD THINK YOU THE WORST BLASPHEMERS OR THE VERY FOOLISHEST OLD WOMEN WITH YOUR NEW BELIEF
MANY SUNS CIRCLE IN DESERT SPACE
AS SLOW AND AS STUPID AS POSSIBLE
SO YE SEEK TO MISLEAD YOUR NEIGHBOUR INTO LOVE AND WOULD FAIN GILD YOURSELVES WITH HIS ERROR
BODY AND WILL HATH IT THERE BECOME
NOW SAY JUST
THE DREAM--AND DICTION--OF A GOD DID THE WORLD THEN SEEM TO ME
BUT I THINK OF WHAT I HAVE DONE AND THOUGHT DURING THE DAY
AS YET HAD HE KNOWN ONLY TEARS AND THE MELANCHOLY OF THE HEBREWS TOGETHER WITH THE HATRED OF THE GOOD AND JUST--THE HEBREW JESUS
TOO EASILY WOULD I BE PULLED UPWARDS AND AWAY
EVEN IN YOUR FOLLY AND DESPISING YE EACH SERVE YOUR SELF YE DESPISERS OF THE BODY
ONLY BE CAREFUL TO WIND THEM UP PROPERLY
HERE WE HAVE A RECORD OF ZARATHUSTRA'S AVOWAL OF OPTIMISM AS ALSO THE IMPORTANT STATEMENT CONCERNING CHANCE OR ACCIDENT VERSE 27 THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY WILL NOT REQUIRE TO BE TOLD WHAT AN IMPORTANT ROLE HIS DOCTRINE OF CHANCE PLAYS IN HIS TEACHING
TO BEHOLD THIS MERELY GLADLY WOULD WE ASCEND HIGHER MOUNTAINS THAN THIS
BUT IT SEEMETH TO ME THAT YE ARE BADLY ADAPTED FOR COMPANY
AH I BECAME TIRED OF THOSE HIGHEST AND BEST ONES
BUT OF WHAT ACCOUNT ARE ALL BELIEVERS
THIS COURAGE AT LAST BADE ME STAND STILL AND SAY
IF THE FIRST LORD BE ONLY THE FIRST SERVANT
HERE AND THERE THERE IS NOTHING TO BETTER NOTHING TO WORSEN
THUS SHALL YE FLOW YE GREAT AND SMALL STREAMS THE HOUR APPROACHETH
BUT THY LAME FOOT IS ALSO WITH THEE ON HORSEBACK
FOR WHERE THERE ARE OASES THERE ARE ALSO IDOLS
YOU I ADVISE NOT TO PEACE BUT TO VICTORY
AM I THEN A NIGGARD WHEN HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS THE VIOLENCE OF HIS PAIN AND A SENSE OF THE NEARNESS OF HIS DEPARTURE FROM HIS FRIENDS CAME OVER HIM SO THAT HE WEPT ALOUD
WHO WAS IT THAT LIKE A WHIRLWIND ONCE RUSHED AWAY FROM ME WHO WHEN DEPARTING CALLED OUT
WHEREVER THOU HAST SAT THERE SAT I ALSO
NIETZSCHE AS AN EVOLUTIONIST I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO DEFINE AND DISCUSS IN THE COURSE OF THESE NOTES SEE NOTES ON CHAPTER LVI PAR.10 AND ON CHAPTER LVII FOR THE PRESENT LET IT SUFFICE FOR US TO KNOW THAT HE ACCEPTED THE DEVELOPMENT HYPOTHESIS AS AN EXPLANATION OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES
BUT WHEREVER I FOUND LIVING THINGS THERE HEARD I ALSO THE LANGUAGE OF OBEDIENCE
FINALLY MY BRETHREN GUARD AGAINST DOING WRONG TO ANY ANCHORITE
OF THIS IMPOSTURE HAVE WE AT LAST BECOME WEARY AND DISGUSTED
BY ONE SOLE TRUENESS ALL SCORCHED AND THIRSTY
EVERYTHING AMONG THEM TALKETH
AND EVEN THOU DISCERNING ONE ART ONLY A PATH AND FOOTSTEP OF MY WILL
YE LOVE TRAGEDIES AND ALL THAT BREAKETH THE HEART
HE WILL HAVE A WORLD WHERE ONE NEED NOT BLUSH FOR ONE'S FELLOWS--HENCE HIS APPEAL TO US TO LOVE ONLY OUR CHILDREN'S LAND THE LAND UNDISCOVERED IN THE REMOTEST SEA
LET HIM GO HE IS GONE
AND WOE UNTO ME IF I COULD NOT LAUGH AT YOUR MARVELLING AND HAD TO SWALLOW ALL THAT IS REPUGNANT IN YOUR PLATTERS
IN VERSE 20 HE GIVES US A HINT WHICH IT WERE WELL NOT TO PASS OVER TOO LIGHTLY
THOU DOST NOT MEAN TO FEED US MERELY WITH DISCOURSES
DESIRING--THAT IS NOW FOR ME TO HAVE LOST MYSELF
GREY IS THE FAVOURITE COLOUR IN WHICH HE WRAPPETH HIS VIRTUE
TO ALL THAT IS DARK DO THEY SPEAK WITH THEIR LIGHT--BUT TO ME THEY ARE SILENT
UP THITHER LEADETH THE WAY THERE LIETH THE CAVE OF ZARATHUSTRA
BEYOND THYSELF SHALT THOU BUILD
OUR AGE KNOWS SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LXX CHAPTER LI
SMALL SHALL MY TEETH GRIND AND CRUSH THEM UNTIL THEY FLOW LIKE MILK INTO MY SOUL WHEN HOWEVER THE PATH AGAIN CURVED ROUND A ROCK ALL AT ONCE THE LANDSCAPE CHANGED AND ZARATHUSTRA ENTERED INTO A REALM OF DEATH
THEN ONLY DID I HIT--THE TRUTH
WHEN THY BIRD SCREAMED OVERHEAD WHEN THOU STOODEST IN THE FOREST IRRESOLUTE IGNORANT WHERE TO GO BESIDE A CORPSE WHEN THOU SPAKEST
OPEN UP AND THROW UNTO ME THY FISH AND SHINING CRABS
IF I WISHED TO SHAKE THIS TREE WITH MY HANDS I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO
NOBLER IS IT TO OWN ONESELF IN THE WRONG THAN TO ESTABLISH ONE'S RIGHT ESPECIALLY IF ONE BE IN THE RIGHT
AND CRUELTY WAS THE DELIGHT OF THAT SOUL
YE HIGHER MEN FOR YOU DOTH IT LONG THIS JOY THIS IRREPRESSIBLE BLESSED JOY--FOR YOUR WOE YE FAILURES
BUT THE OLDEST CARPS ARE STILL LURED BY HER
FOR MY EXPERIENCE TELLS ME THAT EVEN AFTER THE ABOVE DIRECTIONS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE ZEAL THE STUDENT WILL STILL HALT IN PERPLEXITY BEFORE CERTAIN PASSAGES IN THE BOOK BEFORE US AND WONDER WHAT THEY MEAN
EVERMORE DID HE NOW SEE HIMSELF AS THE DOER OF ONE DEED
GRASP NOT AFTER ME
AND VERILY YE GOOD AND JUST
HAVE I NOT SUNK INTO DEEP WELLS
THE BELIEVERS IN THE ORTHODOX BELIEF HATE THEE AND CALL THEE A DANGER TO THE MULTITUDE
THOU LOVEST SHE-ASSES AND FRESH FIGS THOU ART NO FOOD-DESPISER
PRISONERS ARE THEY UNTO ME AND STIGMATISED ONES
THEREBY--HAST THOU ALSO LOST THY WAY
SO DO I WISH
O MY SOUL I DELIVERED THEE FROM ALL BY-PLACES I BRUSHED DOWN FROM THEE DUST AND SPIDERS AND TWILIGHT
EXAMINING THESE HETERODOX PRONOUNCEMENTS A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY HOWEVER WE MAY POSSIBLY PERCEIVE THEIR TRUTH
IT DWELLETH IN THY BODY IT IS THY BODY
EXEMPT ME ONLY FROM THIS
BUT THAT THOU PASSEDST ME BY IN SILENCE THAT THOU BLUSHEDST--I SAW IT WELL
WOE UNTO ALL TABLES AND WALLS AND WHATEVER HATH ROOM FOR FOOL'S SKETCHING FOOL'S SCRAWLING
SO MAN PRESSETH NIGH UNTO HIS NEIGHBOUR
EVEN THROUGH WALLS BLOWETH MY FREE BREATH AND IN INTO PRISONS AND IMPRISONED SPIRITS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
MY THOUGHTS RAN BACK
JUST NOW HAVE I SEEN THEM BENT DOWN--TO CREEP TO THE CROSS
AND THE SMALL INN IN WHICH I LIVED WAS SO CLOSE TO THE WATER THAT AT NIGHT MY SLEEP WOULD BE DISTURBED IF THE SEA WERE HIGH
BUT LIKE INFECTION IS THE PETTY THOUGHT
ONE KNOWETH A LITTLE TOO MUCH ABOUT EVERY ONE
HE HATH FOUNDED FOR HIMSELF A PENANCE-HOUSE AND REFUGE-HOUSE
WEARY YE BECAME OF THE CONFLICT AND NOW YOUR WEARINESS SERVETH THE NEW IDOL
ESPECIALLY HOWEVER UNTO THE SINGING-BIRDS TO LEARN SINGING FROM THEM
VERILY THERE IS STILL A FUTURE EVEN FOR EVIL
IT IS THE FINEST GROWTH
I AM ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS THOSE TEACHERS OF SUBMISSION
AND I WISH THY PAW ALSO TO HAVE CLAWS
I MOCK AT THE WINTER WITH A COLD BATH
DOWN THERE HOWEVER--ALL TALKING IS IN VAIN
VERILY EVEN FOR DYING HAVE WE BECOME TOO WEARY
TO US ARE GRIEF GRUESOMENESS AND GROUND COMMON
LVII
LVII
SEE THEM CLAMBER THESE NIMBLE APES
YE HAD NOT YET SOUGHT YOURSELVES
AND THEREFORE ARE YE NOW ANGRY WITH LIFE AND WITH THE EARTH
HE HOWEVER WHO BELONGETH UNTO ME MUST BE STRONG OF BONE AND LIGHT OF FOOT JOYOUS IN FIGHT AND FEAST NO SULKER NO JOHN O DREAMS READY FOR THE HARDEST TASK AS FOR THE FEAST HEALTHY AND HALE
GUARD AGAINST INJURING THE ANCHORITE
IF EVER MY REJOICING HATH CALLED OUT
THESE ARE FOR THEM THE MASTERS OF THE HOUR
ZARATHUSTRA LISTENED THERETO LIKE THE HIGHER MEN
O ZARATHUSTRA DOST THOU KNOW THAT THIS SEEKING HATH BEEN MY HOME-SICKENING
THIS ZARATHUSTRA DID
SPEAK NO MORE OH HOW COULD I NOT BE ARDENT FOR ETERNITY AND FOR THE MARRIAGE-RING OF RINGS--THE RING OF THE RETURN
PRAISED BE THE GREAT CONSCIENCE-LEECH ZARATHUSTRA THUS SPAKE THE TRODDEN ONE AND ZARATHUSTRA REJOICED AT HIS WORDS AND THEIR REFINED REVERENTIAL STYLE
A GIRDLE OF SPINES IS THEIR PRAISE UNTO ME
BUT JOYS ALL WANT ETERNITY ELEVEN
A HERETIC WILT THOU BE TO THYSELF AND A WIZARD AND A SOOTH-SAYER AND A FOOL AND A DOUBTER AND A REPROBATE AND A VILLAIN
THE KINE HOWEVER SEEMED TO LISTEN EAGERLY TO A SPEAKER AND TOOK NO HEED OF HIM WHO APPROACHED
AND THAT A LIZARD'S CRAFT PROWLED THEREABOUTS LASCIVIOUSLY
AND NOW GLANCETH UP TO ME THEIR ODIOUS SMILE OUT OF THE FOUNTAIN
BUT HIS THIRST DOTH NOT PERSUADE HIM TO BECOME LIKE THOSE COMFORTABLE ONES
HAD THEY HOWEVER NO ONE TO SEE THEM I WAGER THAT WITH THEM ALSO THE BAD GAME WOULD AGAIN COMMENCE THE BAD GAME OF DRIFTING CLOUDS OF DAMP MELANCHOLY OF CURTAINED HEAVENS OF STOLEN SUNS OF HOWLING AUTUMN-WINDS THE BAD GAME OF OUR HOWLING AND CRYING FOR HELP
AND I MYSELF WILL SING A SONG TO HIS DANCE
WHERE THE SOUL--MAY NOT FLY ALOFT TO ITS HEIGHT
WORSE THAN THAT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO SAY AGAINST HIM
BUT THUS DO I COUNSEL YOU MY FRIENDS
A PHYSICIAN
THEN FELL I RIGHT IN RIGHT DOWN RIGHT THROUGH--IN MONG YOU YE FRIENDLY DAMSELS DEARLY LOVED
WHO WOULD STILL HOLD ON TO GOOD AND EVIL PAR
IS THE RABBLE ALSO NECESSARY FOR LIFE
SO MUCH REASON HAVE YE TO FEAR NAKEDNESS
THE ABOVE I KNOW TO BE OPEN TO MUCH CRITICISM
THESE MODERN CREATURES WISH RATHER TO BE HUNTED DOWN WOUNDED AND TORN TO SHREDS THAN TO LIVE ALONE WITH THEMSELVES IN SOLITARY CALM
HAVE I EVER NAMED HER NAME TO YOU
O HEAVEN ABOVE ME THOU MODEST ONE
AND FALSE BE EVERY TRUTH WHICH HATH NOT HAD LAUGHTER ALONG WITH IT
TO THE SWINE ALL THINGS BECOME SWINISH
SMITE YET ONCE MORE
THE REASON THEREOF IS THAT HE CARRIETH TOO MANY EXTRANEOUS THINGS ON HIS SHOULDERS
THEREFORE MUST YE PASS BY MANY A ONE ESPECIALLY MANY OF THE RABBLE WHO DIN YOUR EARS WITH NOISE ABOUT PEOPLE AND PEOPLES
VERILY ALSO NEW STARS DID I MAKE THEM SEE ALONG WITH NEW NIGHTS
THUS DOTH IT CAUSE LESS SHAME
FOR IT WAS A VISION AND A FORESIGHT:--WHAT DID I THEN BEHOLD IN PARABLE
SCIENCE
SCIENCE
SCIENCE
SCIENCE
ONE DAY WHEN HE SAT ON A STONE IN FRONT OF HIS CAVE AND GAZED CALMLY INTO THE DISTANCE--ONE THERE GAZETH OUT ON THE SEA AND AWAY BEYOND SINUOUS ABYSSES,--THEN WENT HIS ANIMALS THOUGHTFULLY ROUND ABOUT HIM AND AT LAST SET THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF HIM
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT THING
ALL LOATHING DID I ONCE VOW TO RENOUNCE
LET THE BEAM OF A STAR SHINE IN YOUR LOVE
AND WHERE YE CAN DIVINE THERE DO YE HATE TO CALCULATE TO YOU ONLY DO I TELL THE ENIGMA THAT I SAW--THE VISION OF THE LONESOMEST ONE GLOOMILY WALKED I LATELY IN CORPSE-COLOURED TWILIGHT--GLOOMILY AND STERNLY WITH COMPRESSED LIPS
BY DIVERS WAYS AND WENDINGS DID I ARRIVE AT MY TRUTH
IT IS STILL AN HOUR TOO EARLY FOR ME HERE
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER LAID HIS HAND UPON HIS MOUTH FOR THE THIRD TIME AND SAID
UNLESS THE WILL SHOULD AT LAST DELIVER ITSELF AND WILLING BECOME NON-WILLING BUT YE KNOW MY BRETHREN THIS FABULOUS SONG OF MADNESS
DID EVER ANY ONE CATCH FISH UPON HIGH MOUNTAINS
I SHALL BE GRATEFUL TO ALL THOSE WHO WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO SHOW ME WHERE AND HOW I HAVE GONE WRONG
NOW NIETZSCHE DISAGREED ENTIRELY WITH RENAN'S VIEW THAT CHRIST WAS LE GRAND MAITRE EN IRONIE
TAKE HEED YE MEN WHEN THOU TEACHEST
NECESSARY HOWEVER IS THE EVIL
AND JUST BEHOLD MY FRIENDS
APPARENTLY HOWEVER HIS SPIRIT RETREATED AND FLED IN ADVANCE AND WAS IN REMOTE DISTANCES AND AS IT WERE WANDERING ON HIGH MOUNTAIN-RIDGES AS IT STANDETH WRITTEN TWIXT TWO SEAS WANDERING TWIXT THE PAST AND THE FUTURE AS A HEAVY CLOUD GRADUALLY HOWEVER WHILE THE HIGHER MEN HELD HIM IN THEIR ARMS HE CAME BACK TO HIMSELF A LITTLE AND RESISTED WITH HIS HANDS THE CROWD OF THE HONOURING AND CARING ONES
HOW DELIGHTFUL IT IS THAT WE FORGET
THEN HOWEVER BECAME THE DEAD WILDERNESS VOCAL
OH FOR THE GOLDEN ROUND RING--WHITHER DOTH IT FLY
IN THEIR WORKING"--THERE IS EVEN PLUNDERING IN THEIR EARNING"--THERE IS EVEN OVERREACHING
ALL FOR MYSELF UPWARD SOARETH OUR SENSE
FOR THE EVIL IS MAN'S BEST FORCE
A ROBBER SHALL ZARATHUSTRA BE CALLED BY THE HERDSMEN IT IS CLEAR THAT THESE WORDS MAY BE TAKEN ALMOST LITERALLY FROM ONE WHOSE IDEAL WAS THE REARING OF A HIGHER ARISTOCRACY
AND THOUGH IT HONOURETH THEE THAT THOU SPEAKEST ONLY IN PRAISE OF THIS DEAD ONE YET THOU KNOWEST AS WELL AS I WHO HE WAS AND THAT HE WENT CURIOUS WAYS TO SPEAK BEFORE THREE EYES SAID THE OLD POPE CHEERFULLY HE WAS BLIND OF ONE EYE IN DIVINE MATTERS I AM MORE ENLIGHTENED THAN ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF--AND MAY WELL BE SO
EVER FEWER ASCEND WITH ME EVER HIGHER MOUNTAINS
IS RECEIVING NOT--PITYING O MY SOUL I UNDERSTAND THE SMILING OF THY MELANCHOLY
MY CAVE IS LARGE AND DEEP AND HATH MANY CORNERS
BUT FOR THAT I HAVE TOO CLEAN HANDS
BUT STILL HE HAD NOT MOVED FROM THE SPOT
HERE ALOFT CAN I NOW SPEAK FREER THAN IN FRONT OF MOUNTAIN-CAVES AND ANCHORITES DOMESTIC ANIMALS
ONE MIGHT HOWEVER RIGHTLY INFER THEREFROM THAT ZARATHUSTRA HAD NOT THEN SLEPT LONG
AND VERILY WHERE SUCH TREES STAND BESIDE ONE ANOTHER THERE ARE HAPPY ISLES
BUT TO MAN DOTH IT EVER IMPEL ME ANEW MY FERVENT CREATIVE WILL
THOU FORGOTTEST THE PATH BEFORE NOW DOST THOU ALSO FORGET HOW TO WALK THEN WAS THERE AGAIN SPOKEN UNTO ME WITHOUT VOICE
NOT BY WRATH BUT BY LAUGHTER DO WE SLAY
WITH THEE DID I UNLEARN THE BELIEF IN WORDS AND WORTHS AND IN GREAT NAMES
VOLUPTUOUSNESS OR SENSUAL PLEASURE IS A DANGEROUS THING TO DISCUSS NOWADAYS
VOLUPTUOUSNESS THIRST OF POWER AND SELFISHNESS,--THE THREE FORCES IN HUMANITY WHICH CHRISTIANITY HAS DONE MOST TO GARBLE AND BESMIRCH,--NIETZSCHE ENDEAVOURS TO REINSTATE IN THEIR FORMER PLACES OF HONOUR
SOLVE UNTO ME THE ENIGMA THAT I THEN BEHELD INTERPRET UNTO ME THE VISION OF THE LONESOMEST ONE
ZARATHUSTRA COMES ACROSS THE REPULSIVE CREATURE SITTING ON THE WAYSIDE AND WHAT DOES HE DO
HE BELIEVETH ALWAYS IN THAT WHEREWITH HE MAKETH BELIEVE MOST STRONGLY--IN HIMSELF
AND IF GREAT THINGS HAVE BEEN A FAILURE WITH YOU HAVE YE YOURSELVES THEREFORE--BEEN A FAILURE
WE ARE ALIEN TO EACH OTHER AND THEIR VIRTUES ARE EVEN MORE REPUGNANT TO MY TASTE THAN THEIR FALSEHOODS AND FALSE DICE
NOT ANY MORE WILL I DISCOURSE UNTO THE PEOPLE
WHY IS THERE SO MUCH NEGATION AND ABNEGATION IN YOUR HEARTS
IN VERSES 23 AND 24 OF THE SECOND PART OF THE DISCOURSE WE ARE REMINDED OF NIETZSCHE'S POWERFUL INDICTMENT OF THE GREAT OF TO-DAY IN THE ANTICHRIST APHORISM 43):--"AT PRESENT NOBODY HAS ANY LONGER THE COURAGE FOR SEPARATE RIGHTS FOR RIGHTS OF DOMINATION FOR A FEELING OF REVERENCE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS EQUALS,--FOR PATHOS OF DISTANCE...OUR POLITICS ARE MORBID FROM THIS WANT OF COURAGE!--THE ARISTOCRACY OF CHARACTER HAS BEEN UNDERMINED MOST CRAFTILY BY THE LIE OF THE EQUALITY OF SOULS
HOW COULD I CALL THAT--SACRIFICING
THE SKY GAZETH BRIGHTLY THEREON THE WORLD LIETH DEEP
AND KNOW NOT THAT I ALSO TRAVEL OVER WARM SEAS LIKE LONGING HEAVY HOT SOUTH-WINDS
FOR IN ORDER TO BE A LAW UNTO HIMSELF MAN MUST POSSESS THE REQUISITE HARDNESS
THEY ARE GENTLER OF HEART AND LAUGH BETTER AND OFTENER THAN YOU
HOW COULD IT BE ENDURED IF THERE WERE NOT A FRIEND
MY BROTHER HAD THE FIGURE OF ZARATHUSTRA IN HIS MIND FROM HIS VERY EARLIEST YOUTH
OUR TO-DAY IS OF THE POPULACE
BEHIND US LIETH AN ETERNITY
AS SOON HOWEVER AS HE WAS QUIET I SAID LAUGHINGLY
I LOVE THOSE THAT KNOW NOT HOW TO LIVE EXCEPT AS DOWN-GOERS FOR THEY ARE THE OVER-GOERS
WHAT MATTER ABOUT THYSELF
TWIXT LAUGHTERS OF LIGHTNINGS WILL I CAST HAIL-SHOWERS INTO THE DEPTHS
HE IS CONFRONTED WITH SCHOPENHAUER AND TEMPTED BY THE OLD SOOTHSAYER TO COMMIT THE SIN OF PITY
THE PALE CRIMINAL HATH BOWED HIS HEAD
RATHER WOULD I SUCCUMB THAN DISOWN THIS ONE THING
FOR AT FIRST HE HAD LAIN OUTSTRETCHED ON THE GROUND HIDDEN AND INDISCERNIBLE LIKE THOSE WHO LIE IN WAIT FOR SWAMP-GAME
FOR THERE DID THEY ALL SIT TOGETHER WHOM HE HAD PASSED DURING THE DAY
FOR THE SAKE OF ZARATHUSTRA WELL
THIS YEA THIS IS BITTERNESS TO MY BOWELS THAT I CAN NEITHER ENDURE YOU NAKED NOR CLOTHED YE PRESENT-DAY MEN
NOT WHEN THE TRUTH IS FILTHY BUT WHEN IT IS SHALLOW DOTH THE DISCERNING ONE GO UNWILLINGLY INTO ITS WATERS
HE EVER BEHELD ME
LEAD LIKE ME THE FLOWN-AWAY VIRTUE BACK TO THE EARTH--YEA BACK TO BODY AND LIFE
I MUST KEEP A TIGHTER HOLD OF IT
THAT IS A REPTILE A CREEPING CRINGING REPTILE THAT TRIETH TO FATTEN ON YOUR INFIRM AND SORE PLACES
PIOUSLY AND SILENTLY DOTH HE STALK ALONG ON THE STAR-CARPETS:--BUT I LIKE NO LIGHT-TREADING HUMAN FEET ON WHICH NOT EVEN A SPUR JINGLETH
MANY HIDDEN CORNERS AND HEIGHTS IN THE LANDSCAPES ROUND ABOUT NICE ARE HALLOWED TO ME BY UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS
I LOVE NOT YOUR FESTIVALS EITHER
HIS WISDOM MEANWHILE INCREASED AND CAUSED HIM PAIN BY ITS ABUNDANCE
6 OF HIGHER MAN YE HIGHER MEN THINK YE THAT I AM HERE TO PUT RIGHT WHAT YE HAVE PUT WRONG
SURPASS YE HIGHER MEN THE PETTY VIRTUES THE PETTY POLICY THE SAND-GRAIN CONSIDERATENESS THE ANT-HILL TRUMPERY THE PITIABLE COMFORTABLENESS THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER
BUT I DO NOT WISH YOUR CONJECTURING TO REACH BEYOND YOUR CREATING WILL
FOR THAT HAVE THEY LEARNED BEST OF US ALL AT PRESENT
THUS LET MY ON-GOING BE THEIR DOWN-GOING
WHEN HOWEVER HE AGAIN CAME TO HIMSELF THEN WAS HE PALE AND TREMBLING AND REMAINED LYING
BUT THE PLEXUS OF CAUSES RETURNETH IN WHICH I AM INTERTWINED,--IT WILL AGAIN CREATE ME
ALL IS VAIN SHY DISTRUST IS REGARDED BY IT AS BASE AND EVERY ONE WHO WANTETH OATHS INSTEAD OF LOOKS AND HANDS
HAVE YE NE'ER SEEN A SAIL CROSSING THE SEA ROUNDED AND INFLATED AND TREMBLING WITH THE VIOLENCE OF THE WIND
HE WHO HATH TO BE A CREATOR IN GOOD AND EVIL--VERILY HE HATH FIRST TO BE A DESTROYER AND BREAK VALUES IN PIECES THIS TEACHING IN REGARD TO SELF-CONTROL IS EVIDENCE ENOUGH OF HIS REVERENCE FOR LAW
WHERE YE ARE THERE MUST ALWAYS BE DREGS AT HAND AND MUCH THAT IS SPONGY HOLLOW AND COMPRESSED
WHERE ARE WE
ONLY WEARY ORDINARY COMFORTABLE:--THEY DECLARE IT
THE PAST OF MAN TO REDEEM AND EVERY IT WAS TO TRANSFORM UNTIL THE WILL SAITH
THUS WISHETH THE TYPE OF NOBLE SOULS
FOR THE SUPERFLUOUS ONES WAS THE STATE DEVISED
MEANWHILE DO I TALK TO MYSELF AS ONE WHO HATH TIME
OUT OF MINE OWN ASHES AND GLOW IT CAME UNTO ME THAT PHANTOM
VERILY A PRODIGY IS THIS POWER OF PRAISING AND BLAMING
WELL SAID HE THITHER LEADETH THE WAY THERE LIETH THE CAVE OF ZARATHUSTRA
CAT-LIKE DOTH THE MOON COME ALONG AND DISHONESTLY THIS PARABLE SPEAK I UNTO YOU SENTIMENTAL DISSEMBLERS UNTO YOU THE PURE DISCERNERS YOU DO I CALL--COVETOUS ONES
WHAT ARE THEY ABOUT HE ASKED HIMSELF AND STOLE UP TO THE ENTRANCE THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE UNOBSERVED TO SEE HIS GUESTS
ON THE SOFT SWARD OF YOUR HEARTS MY FRIENDS!--ON YOUR LOVE WOULD SHE FAIN COUCH HER DEAREST ONE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
READING AND WRITING
READING AND WRITING
IN THY PRESENCE THEY FEEL THEMSELVES SMALL AND THEIR BASENESS GLEAMETH AND GLOWETH AGAINST THEE IN INVISIBLE VENGEANCE
AH WHOSE FOOT HATH NOT FALTERED AND FORGOTTEN IN VICTORY--HOW TO STAND THAT I MAY ONE DAY BE READY AND RIPE IN THE GREAT NOONTIDE
WITH SUPPRESSED TRUTHS WITH FOOL'S HAND AND BEFOOLED HEART AND RICH IN PETTY LIES OF PITY:--THUS HAVE I EVER LIVED AMONG MEN
INEFFABLE IS IT AND NAMELESS THAT WHICH IS PAIN AND SWEETNESS TO MY SOUL AND ALSO THE HUNGER OF MY BOWELS LET THY VIRTUE BE TOO HIGH FOR THE FAMILIARITY OF NAMES AND IF THOU MUST SPEAK OF IT BE NOT ASHAMED TO STAMMER ABOUT IT
OR AS I ONCE SAID IN PARABLE
THAT NO ONE MIGHT SEE DOWN INTO MY DEPTH AND INTO MINE ULTIMATE WILL--FOR THAT PURPOSE DID I DEVISE THE LONG CLEAR SILENCE
SINCE HUMANITY CAME INTO BEING MAN HATH ENJOYED HIMSELF TOO LITTLE
EVIL DO I CALL IT AND MISANTHROPIC
THOU WOULDST FAIN BE RID OF ME
BUT YE SERVANTS OF THE PEOPLE YE FAMOUS WISE ONES--HOW COULD YE GO WITH ME THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
AND THEREFORE CONCERNING GOOD AND EVIL THERE HATH HITHERTO BEEN ONLY ILLUSION AND NOT KNOWLEDGE
ONE MORNING HOWEVER HE AWOKE ERE THE ROSY DAWN AND HAVING MEDITATED LONG ON HIS COUCH AT LAST SPAKE THUS TO HIS HEART
PENITENTS OF THE SPIRIT HAVE I SEEN APPEARING
O PURE ODOURS AROUND ME CRIED HE O BLESSED STILLNESS AROUND ME
ONCE DID I LONG FOR HAPPY AUSPICES
RAISE NO LONGER AN ARM AGAINST THEM
QUICK
PLANKS AND RAILINGS ARE STILL OVER THE STREAM
YEA MADE FOR FAITHFULNESS LIKE ME AND FOR FOND ETERNITIES MUST I NOW NAME YOU BY YOUR FAITHLESSNESS YE DIVINE GLANCES AND FLEETING GLEAMS
NAKED HAVE I SEEN BOTH OF THEM THE GREATEST MAN AND THE SMALLEST MAN ALL-TOO-SIMILAR ARE THEY STILL TO EACH OTHER
IN DIVINING AND KEEPING SILENCE SHALL THE FRIEND BE A MASTER
A YOUNG SHEPHERD DID I SEE WRITHING CHOKING QUIVERING WITH DISTORTED COUNTENANCE AND WITH A HEAVY BLACK SERPENT HANGING OUT OF HIS MOUTH
HE POINTS TO CREATING AS THE SUREST SALVATION FROM THE SUFFERING WHICH IS A CONCOMITANT OF ALL HIGHER LIFE
AND WITH THOSE FIGURES AND PHANTOMS SHALL THEY YET FIGHT WITH EACH OTHER THE SUPREME FIGHT
AND THIS SKIN HATH DISEASES
NOW AM I LIGHT NOW DO I FLY
WOMEN KNOW THAT THE CHOICEST OF THEM
HA
HA
HA
HA
HA

FREE FROM THE HAPPINESS OF SLAVES REDEEMED FROM DEITIES AND ADORATIONS FEARLESS AND FEAR-INSPIRING GRAND AND LONESOME
HE WHO CLIMBETH ON THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS LAUGHETH AT ALL TRAGIC PLAYS AND TRAGIC REALITIES."--ZARATHUSTRA I READING AND WRITING XLV
HE THINKS HE HAS SO FAR HELPED THEM THAT THEY HAVE BECOME CONVALESCENT THAT NEW DESIRES ARE AWAKENED IN THEM AND THAT NEW HOPES ARE IN THEIR ARMS AND LEGS
YE HAD NOT LEARNED TO PLAY AND MOCK AS ONE MUST PLAY AND MOCK
WHO HOWEVER COULD HAVE HUMBLED HIMSELF AS THOU HAST DONE WITH SUCH PRIDE
WE MUST KNOW HOW PERSISTENTLY HE INVEIGHED AGAINST THE OPPRESSING AND DEPRESSING INFLUENCE OF MAN'S SENSE OF GUILT AND CONSCIOUSNESS OF SIN IN ORDER FULLY TO GRASP THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS DISCOURSE
BUT THEY RECEIVED HIM NOT BUT THEY RECEIVED ME NOT SAID THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR THOU KNOWEST IT FORSOOTH
AND THOU INVESTIGATEST THE LEECH TO ITS ULTIMATE BASIS THOU CONSCIENTIOUS ONE O ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED THE TRODDEN ONE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING IMMENSE
BUT MY WORDS ARE POOR CONTEMPTIBLE STAMMERING WORDS
AND WHEN A PERSON GOETH THROUGH FIRE FOR HIS TEACHING--WHAT DOTH THAT PROVE
BUT YE ALSO MY BRETHREN TELL ME
ALREADY DID I STAND PREPARED FOR THE BEST DANCE
NO PEOPLE COULD LIVE WITHOUT FIRST VALUING
SOME SENSATION OF VOLUPTUOUSNESS AND SOME SENSATION OF TEDIUM
THERE ARE THE TERRIBLE ONES WHO CARRY ABOUT IN THEMSELVES THE BEAST OF PREY AND HAVE NO CHOICE EXCEPT LUSTS OR SELF-LACERATION
THEY WANT IN EVERYTHING TO BE MERELY SPECTATORS AND THEY AVOID SITTING WHERE THE SUN BURNETH ON THE STEPS
LIGHT AM I
AND NOW DO I STAND HERE AS EUROPEAN I CAN'T BE DIFFERENT GOD'S HELP TO ME
IT WANTETH THY WHOLE SPIRIT TO BE ITS HERALD IT WANTETH THY WHOLE POWER IN WRATH HATRED AND LOVE
THY LOVE AND THY MODESTY MAKE A REVELATION UNTO MY RAGING SOUL
THE PROUDEST ANIMAL AND THE WISEST ANIMAL--THEY MIGHT WELL BE THE RIGHT COUNSELLORS FOR US BOTH THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND WENT HIS WAY MORE THOUGHTFULLY AND SLOWLY EVEN THAN BEFORE
HAVE I ABUSED WHEN I MEANT TO BLESS THEE
IT IS A NEW FOLLY
THIS REFERS OF COURSE TO SCHOPENHAUER
HATH AN EVIL BEAST BIT THEE THOU UNFORTUNATE ONE THE BLEEDING ONE LAUGHED STILL ANGRY WHAT MATTER IS IT TO THEE SAID HE AND WAS ABOUT TO GO ON
A LITTLE OLDER A LITTLE COLDER SAYS NIETZSCHE
VERILY LIKE A THOUSAND PEALS OF CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER COMETH ZARATHUSTRA INTO ALL SEPULCHRES LAUGHING AT THOSE NIGHT-WATCHMEN AND GRAVE-GUARDIANS AND WHOEVER ELSE RATTLETH WITH SINISTER KEYS
ANIMAL AND MAN COME UNTO ME THE ANCHORITE
FREE FOR WHAT
LOOK AT THAT POOR BODY
PERHAPS HE IS THERE HARD BESET BY AN EVIL BEAST
AH WITH WHAT LONG SEEKING AND SOLVING AND FAILING AND LEARNING AND RE-ATTEMPTING
AROUND LIGHT AND LIBERTY DID THEY ONCE FLUTTER LIKE GNATS AND YOUNG POETS
HERE HAST THOU NOW A FINE SELECTION AND VERILY AN OPPORTUNITY WITH MORE THAN ONE FORELOCK
NOW ONLY DO ALL SONGS OF THE LOVING ONES AWAKE
IN PART I
AH THAT THAT GREAT DEBILITY MAY EVER BE FAR FROM ME
A DANGEROUS CROSSING A DANGEROUS WAYFARING A DANGEROUS LOOKING-BACK A DANGEROUS TREMBLING AND HALTING
THOSE DO I CALL THE ALL-SATISFIED
AND IT IS ALL MY POETISATION AND ASPIRATION TO COMPOSE AND COLLECT INTO UNITY WHAT IS FRAGMENT AND RIDDLE AND FEARFUL CHANCE
THAT GAVE I BACK TO ALL THINGS
SING AND BUBBLE OVER O ZARATHUSTRA HEAL THY SOUL WITH NEW LAYS
BUT HEALTHY AND HOLY CALL I THIS SELFISHNESS ANOTHER SELFISHNESS IS THERE AN ALL-TOO-POOR AND HUNGRY KIND WHICH WOULD ALWAYS STEAL--THE SELFISHNESS OF THE SICK THE SICKLY SELFISHNESS
THEN DID HIS ANIMALS PREVENT HIM FROM SPEAKING FURTHER
THERE ARE FEW PAINS SO GRIEVOUS AS TO HAVE SEEN DIVINED OR EXPERIENCED HOW AN EXCEPTIONAL MAN HAS MISSED HIS WAY AND DETERIORATED HE KNEW FROM HIS PAINFULLEST RECOLLECTIONS ON WHAT WRETCHED OBSTACLES PROMISING DEVELOPMENTS OF THE HIGHEST RANK HAVE HITHERTO USUALLY GONE TO PIECES BROKEN DOWN SUNK AND BECOME CONTEMPTIBLE NOW IN PART IV
TO THINK THIS IS GIDDINESS AND VERTIGO TO HUMAN LIMBS AND EVEN VOMITING TO THE STOMACH
AND SHOULD YE CELEBRATE IT AGAIN THIS ASS-FESTIVAL DO IT FROM LOVE TO YOURSELVES DO IT ALSO FROM LOVE TO ME
AND EVER WHEN I HAVE HEARD SUBVERSIVE AND SPOUTING DEVILS SPEAK I HAVE FOUND THEM LIKE THEE
WITH WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE THE READER WHILE READING IT AS POETRY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEEK AND FIND HIS OWN MEANING IN IT
BUT WHY DOTH ZARATHUSTRA SPEAK OTHERWISE UNTO US THAN UNTO HIS DISCIPLES ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED
SO SPEAKETH IT OUT OF THAT EYE
OH THAT FALSIFIED LIGHT THAT MUSTIFIED AIR
YE SHALL ONLY HAVE ENEMIES TO BE HATED BUT NOT ENEMIES TO BE DESPISED
IT SAITH NOT EGO BUT DOETH IT
BOTH HOWEVER FIT FOR DANCING WITH HEAD AND LEGS
THUS DO I LOVE ONLY MY CHILDREN'S LAND THE UNDISCOVERED IN THE REMOTEST SEA
ARE YE STOUT-HEARTED
AT ALL EVENTS HE RESOLVED TO DISTRIBUTE THIS MANUSCRIPT PRODUCTION OF WHICH ONLY FORTY COPIES WERE PRINTED ONLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAD PROVED THEMSELVES WORTHY OF IT AND IT SPEAKS ELOQUENTLY OF HIS UTTER LONELINESS AND NEED OF SYMPATHY IN THOSE DAYS THAT HE HAD OCCASION TO PRESENT ONLY SEVEN COPIES OF HIS BOOK ACCORDING TO THIS RESOLUTION
HOW THEN COULD YE BE FIT FOR MY WARFARE
THAT THERE IS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR NIETZSCHE'S HYPOTHESIS OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS GREAT AND SMALL NOBODY WHO HAS READ THE LITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT WILL DOUBT FOR AN INSTANT
ZARATHUSTRA CREATED THE MOST PORTENTOUS ERROR MORALITY CONSEQUENTLY HE SHOULD ALSO BE THE FIRST TO PERCEIVE THAT ERROR NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE HAS HAD LONGER AND GREATER EXPERIENCE OF THE SUBJECT THAN ANY OTHER THINKER--ALL HISTORY IS THE EXPERIMENTAL REFUTATION OF THE THEORY OF THE SO-CALLED MORAL ORDER OF THINGS:--THE MORE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT ZARATHUSTRA WAS MORE TRUTHFUL THAN ANY OTHER THINKER
THEN SUDDENLY DID I HEAR A DOG HOWL NEAR ME
I KNOW IT WELL
HOW I HATE HIM WHO FLIETH
NOW RAGETH MY HAMMER RUTHLESSLY AGAINST ITS PRISON
NOT BY ANY MEANS OWING TO THE GOODNESS OF THE PEOPLE BUT BECAUSE OF THE STRUGGLES OF THEIR EVIL INSTINCTS
TO BE SURE
MY DAY BEGINNETH
BUT WHO SHAKETH THAT HEAD
NOW PIPETH HE AS THE WIND AND PREACHETH SADNESS IN SAD STRAINS
WHAT OF THAT
HAIL
HAIL
I DO NOT THINK NIETZSCHE'S PROFOUNDEST VIEWS ON MARRIAGE WERE EVER INTENDED TO BE GIVEN OVER TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL AT LEAST NOT FOR THE PRESENT
I KNOW THEE WELL SAID HE WITH A BRAZEN VOICE THOU ART THE MURDERER OF GOD
A CHILD EVEN FINDETH CAUSE FOR IT CHAPTER LXXIV
BUT EVEN THIS HAVE YE HEARD FROM ME WHO IS STILL THE MOST RESERVED OF MEN--AND WILL BE SO
THAT MAY BE THE CASE OR IT MAY BE OTHERWISE
HIM WHO BREAKETH UP THEIR TABLES OF VALUES THE BREAKER THE LAW-BREAKER--HE HOWEVER IS THE CREATOR
DO NOT HOWEVER LOOK AT ME
THOU ART NOT GREAT THE MAGICIAN IS NEVERTHELESS SENT AS A GUEST TO ZARATHUSTRA'S CAVE
LO I MYSELF AM SURELY THE MOST GODLESS OF US AT PRESENT
BUT WHEN THE DANCE WAS OVER AND THE MAIDENS HAD DEPARTED HE BECAME SAD
OR THE YEA AND AMEN LAY 1
WEEP YE NO MORE PALLID DUDU
OR A GENUINE ONE
LXXIX
LXXIX
AND THIS DAY IS TO HAVE A LONG EVENING
WOULDST THOU SEE THE TARANTULA ITSELF
STRENGTH HEALTH SUPERABUNDANCE OF ANIMAL SPIRITS AND POWER ARE REGARDED WITH HATE SUSPICION AND FEAR BY THE SUBORDINATE CLASS
CONSCIENTIOUS--SO CALL I HIM WHO GOETH INTO GOD-FORSAKEN WILDERNESSES AND HATH BROKEN HIS VENERATING HEART
OH COME MY FRIENDS THAT THE STILLNESS MAY BECOME MORE BLISSFUL
SEEST THOU NOT THE SOULS HANGING LIKE LIMP DIRTY RAGS?--AND THEY MAKE NEWSPAPERS ALSO OUT OF THESE RAGS
I LOVE THE GREAT DESPISERS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE GREAT ADORERS AND ARROWS OF LONGING FOR THE OTHER SHORE
ZARATHUSTRA SEES A YOUNG SHEPHERD STRUGGLING ON THE GROUND WITH A SNAKE HOLDING FAST TO THE BACK OF HIS THROAT
THEY SHOUT TO ONE ANOTHER
WHO COULD SEE THY SMILING AND NOT MELT INTO TEARS
YEA YE ALSO MY FRIENDS WILL BE ALARMED BY MY WILD WISDOM
MUCH CONCEALED GOODNESS AND POWER IS NEVER DREAMT OF
SEVEN-FOLD FROZEN ICE FOR VERY ENEMIES FOR FOES DOTH MAKE ONE THIRST GIVE YIELD TO ME CRUELLEST FOE THYSELF AWAY
AND THEIR OWN BODY IS FOR THEM THE THING-IN-ITSELF
AM I WORLDLY FOR THEE
WHAT DO THESE KINGS WANT IN MY DOMAIN SAID ZARATHUSTRA IN ASTONISHMENT TO HIS HEART AND HID HIMSELF HASTILY BEHIND A THICKET
XLV
AND IN SUCH REMAINETH ALSO THE SPIRIT PATIENT
BUT TO WHAT DID THEY OWE THE CONVULSION AND RAPTURE OF THEIR TRANSPORT
CONSTRAINT LAW NECESSITY AND CONSEQUENCE AND PURPOSE AND WILL AND GOOD AND EVIL FOR MUST THERE NOT BE THAT WHICH IS DANCED OVER DANCED BEYOND
AND VERILY I AM WELL-DISPOSED TO MINE ETERNAL FATE BECAUSE IT DOTH NOT HOUND AND HURRY ME BUT LEAVETH ME TIME FOR MERRIMENT AND MISCHIEF
WE DO NOT SPEAK TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE WE KNOW TOO MUCH
AS CORPSES THEY THOUGHT TO LIVE
NAY I LIKE HIM NOT THAT TOM-CAT ON THE ROOFS
FROM THENCE CAME HIS CRY
THE SHORE HATH VANISHED,--NOW HATH FALLEN FROM ME THE LAST CHAIN THE BOUNDLESS ROARETH AROUND ME FAR AWAY SPARKLE FOR ME SPACE AND TIME,--WELL
AND WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN-RIDGE BEHOLD THERE LAY THE OTHER SEA SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM
NEVER IN MY LIFE DID I CREEP BEFORE THE POWERFUL
BUT FOR THE CREATOR TO APPEAR SUFFERING ITSELF IS NEEDED AND MUCH TRANSFORMATION
HE HIMSELF CRIED OUT YE-A LOUDER EVEN THAN THE ASS AND SPRANG INTO THE MIDST OF HIS MADDENED GUESTS
FOR IT MIGHT SOME DAY HAPPEN FOR THE POPULACE TO BECOME MASTER AND DROWN ALL TIME IN SHALLOW WATERS
WILL ZARATHUSTRA STEAL THE BITE FROM THE DEVIL
ON ACCOUNT OF THOSE ABSOLUTE AND IMPATIENT ONES BE NOT JEALOUS THOU LOVER OF TRUTH
AHA!--DISGUST DISGUST DISGUST--ALAS TO ME
THE ASS HOWEVER HERE BRAYED YE-A
THE ASS HOWEVER HERE BRAYED YE-A
THE ASS HOWEVER HERE BRAYED YE-A
THE ASS HOWEVER HERE BRAYED YE-A
THE ASS HOWEVER HERE BRAYED YE-A
THE ASS HOWEVER HERE BRAYED YE-A
THE ASS HOWEVER HERE BRAYED YE-A
THE ASS HOWEVER HERE BRAYED YE-A
AND VERILY FOR YOUR BLISS YE DISCERNING ONES
IT--COULDST THOU NOT ENDURE THEN HAPPENED THAT WHICH MADE ME LIGHTER
HAVE NOT NAMES AND TONES BEEN GIVEN UNTO THINGS THAT MAN MAY REFRESH HIMSELF WITH THEM
THOU PLEASEST ME HAPPINESS
WHY SHOULD THERE NOT BE SOMETHING OF BIRD-NATURE THEREIN
RESPECT AND MODESTY IN PRESENCE OF SLEEP
BE NOT VIRTUOUS BEYOND YOUR POWERS
AND HIS HAPPINESS SHOULD SMELL OF THE EARTH AND NOT OF CONTEMPT FOR THE EARTH
I LOVE HIM WHO CHASTENETH HIS GOD BECAUSE HE LOVETH HIS GOD
AWAY WITH SUCH A GOD
FALSE ARE EVEN ITS BOWELS
THAT IS ITS HONOURABLENESS
GLADLY DO I PICK UP WHAT FALLETH FROM THE TABLE AT YOUR REPASTS
THE GOD VEILETH HIS BEAUTY
THY SELF LAUGHETH AT THINE EGO AND ITS PROUD PRANCINGS
THE AWAKENING
THE AWAKENING
THE AWAKENING
WHAT IS THE HEAVIEST THING YE HEROES
THOU CANST NOT ADORN THYSELF FINE ENOUGH FOR THY FRIEND
TOO LONG HAVE WE LOST OURSELVES IN OUR FRIENDS AND ENTERTAINMENTS TO BE ABLE TO FIND OURSELVES SO SOON AT ANOTHER'S BIDDING
THIRD PART
THIRD PART
FOR WE OUGHT TO LEARN FROM THEM ONE THING
EVEN INTO THE HEIGHTS OF THEIR VIRTUE AND INTO THEIR COLD SPIRIT DOTH THIS CREATURE FOLLOW THEM WITH ITS DISCORD
PARALYSED PARALYSING
THEN BE GREAT ENOUGH NOT TO BE ASHAMED OF THEM
HE NEVER LAID CLAIM TO A VERY PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE OF BIOLOGY AND HIS CRITICISM IS FAR MORE VALUABLE AS THE ATTITUDE OF A FRESH MIND THAN AS THAT OF A SPECIALIST TOWARDS THE QUESTION
THITHER WILL I CARRY AN EVERGREEN WREATH OF LIFE RESOLVING THUS IN MY HEART DID I SAIL O'ER THE SEA OH YE SIGHTS AND SCENES OF MY YOUTH
IF I DID NOT MYSELF SIGH BEFORE THEM AND CHATTER WITH COLD AND PATIENTLY LET MYSELF BE SWATHED IN THEIR PITY
CHAPTER LXIV
NIETZSCHE PRACTICALLY TELLS US HERE THAT IT IS NOT HE WHO INTENTIONALLY WEARS ECCENTRIC CLOTHES OR DOES ECCENTRIC THINGS WHO IS TRULY THE INDIVIDUALIST
ART THOU NOT THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR WHO ONCE CAST AWAY GREAT RICHES WHO WAS ASHAMED OF HIS RICHES AND OF THE RICH AND FLED TO THE POOREST TO BESTOW UPON THEM HIS ABUNDANCE AND HIS HEART
GO OUT UNTO THE ROSES THE BEES AND THE FLOCKS OF DOVES
I WENT INDEED UNTO MEN BUT NOT YET HAVE I ATTAINED UNTO THEM THEN WAS THERE AGAIN SPOKEN UNTO ME WITHOUT VOICE
FOR THAT THOU MAYST KNOW IT,--THE HEART OF THE EARTH IS OF GOLD WHEN THE FIRE-DOG HEARD THIS HE COULD NO LONGER ENDURE TO LISTEN TO ME
THAT ONLY WOULD I CALL MY SUMMIT THAT HATH REMAINED FOR ME AS MY LAST SUMMIT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA TO HIMSELF WHILE ASCENDING COMFORTING HIS HEART WITH HARSH MAXIMS
HERE DO ALL GREAT SENTIMENTS DECAY
DW CONTENTS
ONCE WERE YE APES AND EVEN YET MAN IS MORE OF AN APE THAN ANY OF THE APES
BY IT BREAKETH EGG AND EGG-SHELL
WITH THY LOVE GO INTO THINE ISOLATION MY BROTHER AND WITH THY CREATING
THE LEAST THING PRECISELY THE GENTLEST THING THE LIGHTEST THING A LIZARD'S RUSTLING A BREATH A WHISK AN EYE-GLANCE--LITTLE MAKETH UP THE BEST HAPPINESS
WHY NOT BE LIKE ME--A BEAR AMONGST BEARS A BIRD AMONGST BIRDS AND WHAT DOETH THE SAINT IN THE FOREST ASKED ZARATHUSTRA
THIS CUP IS AGAIN GOING TO EMPTY ITSELF AND ZARATHUSTRA IS AGAIN GOING TO BE A MAN
WHENCE COME THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS
SO EVIL DID IT SOUND
ABILITY TO WAIT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
WOULD THAT A STORM CAME AND SHOOK ALL THIS ROTTENNESS AND WORM-EATENNESS FROM THE TREE
THIS ITS NEIGHBOUR UNDERSTANDETH NOT
WHY DID I STARTLE IN MY DREAM SO THAT I AWOKE
O MY FRIEND MAN IS SOMETHING THAT HATH TO BE SURPASSED
ONCE MORE IN SUCH SPEECH HOWEVER THERE IS MUCH SOUND OF TRIUMPH
WHEN HOWEVER HE CAME INTO THE VICINITY OF THE SEA AND AT LAST STOOD ALONE AMONGST THE CLIFFS THEN HAD HE BECOME WEARY ON HIS WAY AND EAGERER THAN EVER BEFORE
SHAME SHAME SHAME--THAT IS THE HISTORY OF MAN
AND OVER CLOUD AND DAY AND NIGHT DID I SPREAD OUT LAUGHTER LIKE A GAY-COLOURED CANOPY
OUR GOOD SOCIETY
SO SAY THE HERD
NOT MY HATRED BUT MY LOATHING GNAWED HUNGRILY AT MY LIFE
AND MANY A ONE HATH GONE INTO THE WILDERNESS AND KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS WEARY OF BEING THE BATTLE AND BATTLEFIELD OF VIRTUES
ONCE THE MOST FAVOURABLE ORDER OF CONDUCT IS FOUND PROVED EFFICIENT AND ESTABLISHED IT BECOMES THE RULING MORALITY OF THE SPECIES THAT ADOPTS IT AND BEARS THEM ALONG TO VICTORY
DOTH THE ABYSS HERE YAWN FOR YOU
A CHILD EVEN FINDETH CAUSE FOR IT
YE CRUMBLE AWAY YE COMFORTABLE ONES
AND BEHOLD THEREBY CAME HE UNAWARES ALSO TO THE GATE OF THE GREAT CITY
IT IS CALLED MY WILL
I SEE THEE DEAFENED WITH THE NOISE OF THE GREAT MEN AND STUNG ALL OVER WITH THE STINGS OF THE LITTLE ONES
BUT HE WHO DISCOVERED THE COUNTRY OF MAN DISCOVERED ALSO THE COUNTRY OF MAN'S FUTURE NOW SHALL YE BE SAILORS FOR ME BRAVE PATIENT
HERE LAUGH LAUGH MY HEARTY HEALTHY WICKEDNESS
POOR EARTH
I WOULD FAIN BESTOW AND DISTRIBUTE UNTIL THE WISE HAVE ONCE MORE BECOME JOYOUS IN THEIR FOLLY AND THE POOR HAPPY IN THEIR RICHES
AND EVEN THE HOURS RUN HERE ON LIGHTER FEET
DISTRUST ALL THOSE WHO TALK MUCH OF THEIR JUSTICE
THUS SHOULD ONE LEARN TO DIE
AND LO
AND LO
AND LO
LET YOUR COMMANDING ITSELF BE OBEYING
AH ABYSMAL THOUGHT WHICH ART MY THOUGHT
ONE REQUITETH A TEACHER BADLY IF ONE REMAIN MERELY A SCHOLAR
NIETZSCHE'S VIEWS ON WOMEN HAVE EITHER TO BE LOVED AT FIRST SIGHT OR THEY BECOME PERHAPS THE GREATEST OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF THOSE WHO OTHERWISE WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACCEPT HIS PHILOSOPHY
THUS DO I ASK THEE
AND I LOVE THOSE WHO DO NOT WISH TO PRESERVE THEMSELVES THE DOWN-GOING ONES DO I LOVE WITH MINE ENTIRE LOVE
THE REVERSE OF THE COWARDICE OF THE IDEALIST WHO FLEES FROM REALITY
THEREFORE PREACH THE VISIONARIES AND BOWED-HEADS WHOSE HEARTS ARE ALSO BOWED DOWN
WELCOME HITHER SAID ZARATHUSTRA THOU SOOTHSAYER OF THE GREAT WEARINESS NOT IN VAIN SHALT THOU ONCE HAVE BEEN MY MESSMATE AND GUEST
YOUR LIES DOTH HE EVEN BELIEVE WHEN YOU LIE FAVOURABLY ABOUT HIM
I UNLEARNED LONG AGO TO HAVE CONSIDERATION FOR LONG EARS
HEAR YE IT NOT
ELEVATED IS THEN YOUR BODY AND RAISED UP
THERE ARE ON THE EARTH MANY GOOD INVENTIONS SOME USEFUL SOME PLEASANT
FOR WHEN THE DEAD-LEAF BUTTERFLY IS IN DANGER IT CLINGS TO THE SIDE OF A TWIG AND WHAT IT SAYS TO ITS FOE IS PRACTICALLY THIS
LUDOVICI
LUDOVICI
LUDOVICI
UNTO THEE DID I SPRING
CONCEPTS OF GOOD AND EVIL ARE THEREFORE IN THEIR ORIGIN MERELY A MEANS TO AN END THEY ARE EXPEDIENTS FOR ACQUIRING POWER
THE ROLLING RUMBLING PUNITIVE DEMOLISHER OF WHITED SEPULCHRES
AND SOUL IS ONLY THE NAME OF SOMETHING IN THE BODY THE BODY IS A BIG SAGACITY A PLURALITY WITH ONE SENSE A WAR AND A PEACE A FLOCK AND A SHEPHERD
MY FRIENDS I WILL NOT BE MIXED UP AND CONFOUNDED WITH OTHERS
WHY IS THERE SO LITTLE FATE IN YOUR LOOKS
AND FIRE FALLING UPON US THEN DO WE TURN DUST LIKE ASHES:--YEA THE FIRE ITSELF HAVE WE MADE AWEARY
SPEAK NOT OF ME THOU STRANGE ONE
TO HIM WILL ALL LANDMARKS THEMSELVES FLY INTO THE AIR
THOU LONESOME ONE THOU GOEST THE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE
IT IS THE GOOD WAR WHICH HALLOWETH EVERY CAUSE
THE BEST BAIT AS HUNTSMEN AND FISHERMEN REQUIRE IT
FOR THE SAKE OF FOLLY WISDOM IS MIXED IN ALL THINGS
YOU CAN HAVE NO IDEA OF THE VEHEMENCE OF SUCH COMPOSITION AND IN ECCE HOMO AUTUMN 1888 HE DESCRIBES AS FOLLOWS WITH PASSIONATE ENTHUSIASM THE INCOMPARABLE MOOD IN WHICH HE CREATED ZARATHUSTRA HAS ANY ONE AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ANY DISTINCT NOTION OF WHAT POETS OF A STRONGER AGE UNDERSTOOD BY THE WORD INSPIRATION
THEN WOULD ALSO MY LOVE RUN AWAY FROM THEE QUICKLY THEREUPON DID LIFE LOOK THOUGHTFULLY BEHIND AND AROUND AND SAID SOFTLY
WITH ALL OF THY GREAT TORTURES
HE FOUGHT FOR ALL WHO DO NOT WANT TO LIVE UNLESS THEY LEARN AGAIN TO HOPE--UNLESS THEY LEARN FROM HIM THE GREAT HOPE ZARATHUSTRA'S ADDRESS TO HIS GUESTS SHOWS CLEARLY ENOUGH HOW HE WISHED TO HELP THEM
ZARATHUSTRA'S HABIT OF DESIGNATING A WHOLE CLASS OF MEN OR A WHOLE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT BY A SINGLE FITTING NICKNAME MAY PERHAPS LEAD TO A LITTLE CONFUSION AT FIRST
CHAPTER XLVII
THOU SHALT BE CLOSEST UNTO HIM WITH THY HEART WHEN THOU WITHSTANDEST HIM
THAT IS MY GOOD THAT DO I LOVE THUS DOTH IT PLEASE ME ENTIRELY THUS ONLY DO I DESIRE THE GOOD
TOGETHER DID WE LEARN EVERYTHING
VIRTUE IS NECESSARY
THOU ART SO VERY WEARY
I ASK THEE
TO STAND WITH RELAXED MUSCLES AND WITH UNHARNESSED WILL
LET US SEE TO IT THAT WE MAINTAIN OUR LOVE
HERE THERE ARE STATES
THEN DID MY HEART DETERMINE THAT I SHOULD SEEK ANOTHER THE MOST PIOUS OF ALL THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT IN GOD MY HEART DETERMINED THAT I SHOULD SEEK ZARATHUSTRA THUS SPAKE THE HOARY MAN AND GAZED WITH KEEN EYES AT HIM WHO STOOD BEFORE HIM
BUT NOT LUCKY MINES NOR TREASURE-CHAMBERS NOR NEW GOLD-VEINS OF HAPPINESS
THAT IS TO SAY THE DISGUST THAT CLEAVETH UNTO THY MOUTH WHO ART THOU AT ALL CRIED HERE THE OLD MAGICIAN WITH DEFIANT VOICE WHO DARETH TO SPEAK THUS UNTO ME THE GREATEST MAN NOW LIVING?"--AND A GREEN FLASH SHOT FROM HIS EYE AT ZARATHUSTRA
DAWN IS BEHIND US
A CAST WHICH YE MADE HAD FAILED
OF ALL THAT IS WRITTEN I LOVE ONLY WHAT A PERSON HATH WRITTEN WITH HIS BLOOD
BUT I NEVER BELIEVED IN THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY SPAKE OF GREAT MEN--AND I HOLD TO MY BELIEF THAT IT WAS A REVERSED CRIPPLE WHO HAD TOO LITTLE OF EVERYTHING AND TOO MUCH OF ONE THING
FIT FOR MATERNITY THE OTHER
ONE THING IS MORE NECESSARY THAN THE OTHER SO SAYEST THOU THYSELF
22
AND YOUR MARRIAGE PUTTETH AN END TO MANY SHORT FOLLIES WITH ONE LONG STUPIDITY
SAY THEN
AH I WOULD INDEED BUT HOW CAN I DO IT
THEN THERE GREW FOR ME THE PINIONS TO SOAR AWAY INTO DISTANT FUTURES
AND AS HE WALKED ALONE ONE EVENING OVER THE HILLS SURROUNDING THE TOWN CALLED THE PIED COW BEHOLD THERE FOUND HE THE YOUTH SITTING LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND GAZING WITH WEARIED LOOK INTO THE VALLEY
XXXV
XXXV
I NOW GO ALONE MY DISCIPLES
AND BE ON THY GUARD ALSO AGAINST THE ASSAULTS OF THY LOVE
THAT GREAT POWER AND TENDERNESS ARE KIN WAS ALREADY HIS BELIEF IN 1875--EIGHT YEARS BEFORE HE WROTE THIS SPEECH AND WHEN THE BIRDS AND THE LION COME TO HIM IT IS BECAUSE HE IS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TWO QUALITIES
WHEN I SHALL HAVE SURMOUNTED MYSELF THEREIN THEN WILL I SURMOUNT MYSELF ALSO IN THAT WHICH IS GREATER
THEIR HEART REPEATETH THEIR SOUL OBEYETH
OR I FOR COURAGE IS THE BEST SLAYER,--COURAGE WHICH ATTACKETH
HEAR THAT YE BOYS
THEN SEE TO IT THAT YE CEASE
FOR ALMOST ALL THOSE TO WHOM HE PRESENTED COPIES OF THE WORK MISUNDERSTOOD IT
FOR THE MOTIVE FORCE BEHIND THE PEOPLE PRACTISING IT IS THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER THE ANTITHESIS GOOD AND BAD TO THIS FIRST CLASS MEANS THE SAME AS NOBLE AND DESPICABLE BAD IN THE MASTER-MORALITY MUST BE APPLIED TO THE COWARD TO ALL ACTS THAT SPRING FROM WEAKNESS TO THE MAN WITH AN EYE TO THE MAIN CHANCE WHO WOULD FORSAKE EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO LIVE
VERILY IT WAS ALWAYS YOUR DOING
ANSWERING MORE WEIGHTILY A COMMANDER A VICTOR
I LAUGHED AND LAUGHED WHILE MY FOOT STILL TREMBLED AND MY HEART AS WELL
THE AUDIENT EAR FOR ME--THE OBEDIENT EAR IS YET LACKING IN THEIR LIMBS THIS HAD ZARATHUSTRA SPOKEN TO HIS HEART WHEN THE SUN AROSE
WHAT IS CREATION
HE WHO SEETH THE ABYSS BUT WITH EAGLE'S EYES,--HE WHO WITH EAGLE'S TALONS GRASPETH THE ABYSS
THEY ARE A POOR SICKLY TYPE A POPULACE-TYPE
SOMETHING UNAPPEASED UNAPPEASABLE IS WITHIN ME
SPIRIT IS ALSO VOLUPTUOUSNESS,"--SAID THEY
ON THE STAFF DID LIFE CREEP ALONG WITH THE BLIND ONE
THOU SEEMEST TO ME TRANSFORMED THINE EYES GLOW THE MANTLE OF THE SUBLIME COVERETH THINE UGLINESS
I TEACH YOU THE FRIEND IN WHOM THE WORLD STANDETH COMPLETE A CAPSULE OF THE GOOD,--THE CREATING FRIEND WHO HATH ALWAYS A COMPLETE WORLD TO BESTOW
BUT IT IS MY LONESOMENESS TO BE BEGIRT WITH LIGHT
THOU STEALEST NIGH IN MIDNIGHT'S GLOOMY HOUR
HIGH ENOUGH FOR THE LIGHTNING
I DO NOT DOUBT BUT THAT ONE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN ORDER TO FIND SOME ONE WHO COULD SAY TO ME
THE HIGHER ITS TYPE ALWAYS THE SELDOMER DOTH A THING SUCCEED
THIS EARTHLY IS IT THAT HATH TOO MUCH PATIENCE WITH YOU YE BLASPHEMERS
CHAPTER LXV
GRIND THY CORN DRINK THY WATER PRAISE THY COOKING,--IF ONLY IT MAKE THEE GLAD
WHAT HAPPENETH UNTO ME THOUGHT ZARATHUSTRA IN HIS ASTONISHED HEART AND SLOWLY SEATED HIMSELF ON THE BIG STONE WHICH LAY CLOSE TO THE EXIT FROM HIS CAVE
TEN TIMES A DAY MUST THOU OVERCOME THYSELF
ONE LOSES ALL PERCEPTION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES THE FIGURE AND WHAT CONSTITUTES THE SIMILE
SLEW YE NOT MY YOUTH'S VISIONS AND DEAREST MARVELS
THOU ART NOT A BUTCHER
BUT LET THIS BE YOUR HONOUR
THERE IS NO SALVATION FOR HIM WHO THUS SUFFERETH FROM HIMSELF UNLESS IT BE SPEEDY DEATH
THE IMAGE OF THIS GOD DEGENERATES WITH THE PEOPLE THAT APPROPRIATE IT AND GRADUALLY HE BECOMES A GOD OF LOVE--"SOFT AND MELLOW A LOWER MIDDLE-CLASS DEITY WHO IS PITIFUL HE CAN NO LONGER BE A GOD WHO REQUIRES SACRIFICE FOR WE OURSELVES ARE NO LONGER RICH ENOUGH FOR THAT
HIM WHOM I LOVE I LOVE BETTER IN WINTER THAN IN SUMMER
TOGETHER DID WE LEARN TO ASCEND BEYOND OURSELVES TO OURSELVES AND TO SMILE UNCLOUDEDLY UNCLOUDEDLY TO SMILE DOWN OUT OF LUMINOUS EYES AND OUT OF MILES OF DISTANCE WHEN UNDER US CONSTRAINT AND PURPOSE AND GUILT STEAM LIKE RAIN
AH YE MEN WITHIN THE STONE SLUMBERETH AN IMAGE FOR ME THE IMAGE OF MY VISIONS
TOO LONG HAVE I SAT WITH LONESOMENESS
I CALL THEM WISE NOT STIFF--THUS DID I LEARN TO SLUR OVER WORDS
ON THE ROUGH STONES DID SHE BEAR THE YOUNGEST OF HER YOUNG
YEARS AFTER HIS BREAK WITH WAGNER HE WROTE THE CASE OF WAGNER AND NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER AND THESE WORKS ARE WITH US TO PROVE THE SINCERITY AND DEPTH OF HIS VIEWS ON THE MAN WHO WAS THE GREATEST EVENT OF HIS LIFE
VERILY TOO EARLY DIED THAT HEBREW WHOM THE PREACHERS OF SLOW DEATH HONOUR
THERE IT IS SAID LIKE AND LIKE AND HAND WASHETH HAND":--THEY HAVE NEITHER THE RIGHT NOR THE POWER FOR YOUR SELF-SEEKING
A HARVEST
SIT DOWN HERE BESIDE ME
LIKE LEAVENED DOUGH LAYEST THOU THY SOUL AROSE AND SWELLED BEYOND ALL ITS BOUNDS O MINE ANIMALS ANSWERED ZARATHUSTRA TALK ON THUS AND LET ME LISTEN
SO LET US PART
YE ARE UGLY
I LOVE HIM WHOSE SOUL IS DEEP EVEN IN THE WOUNDING AND MAY SUCCUMB THROUGH A SMALL MATTER
VERILY THE LANGUAGE OF A JOYOUS WISDOM
HAPPINESS HOWEVER IS A WOMAN XLVIII
HERE FLY OPEN UNTO ME ALL BEING'S WORDS AND WORD-CABINETS
SO HE HALTED AT A LONELY HOUSE IN WHICH A LIGHT WAS BURNING
VERILY THERE ARE CHASTE ONES FROM THEIR VERY NATURE
CROOKED IS THE PATH OF ETERNITY O YE WAGS AND BARREL-ORGANS
FEW PEOPLE KNOW IT BUT ONE MUST HAVE ALL THE VIRTUES IN ORDER TO SLEEP WELL
AYE IF YE WERE GODS YE COULD THEN BE ASHAMED OF CLOTHING
AND ON THE MARKET-PLACE ONE CONVINCETH WITH GESTURES
BUT THIS BLESSED SECURITY HAVE I FOUND IN ALL THINGS THAT THEY PREFER--TO DANCE ON THE FEET OF CHANCE
LET YOUR DISTINCTION BE OBEDIENCE
SHE KNOWETH ONLY LOVE
LOST ARE MY FRIENDS
FOR IN MANKIND THERE IS A CONTINUAL WAR BETWEEN THE POWERFUL THE NOBLE THE STRONG AND THE WELL-CONSTITUTED ON THE ONE SIDE AND THE IMPOTENT THE MEAN THE WEAK AND THE ILL-CONSTITUTED ON THE OTHER
THOU WILT YET BREAK AND BURST BY THE NUMEROUS DROPS
THUS IS IT WITH THE MAN WHO CANNOT YET FLY
FOR HE IS STILL THE MOST STEADFAST TOWER AND WILL TO-DAY WHEN EVERYTHING TOTTERETH WHEN ALL THE EARTH QUAKETH
AND VERILY ALREADY HATH THY BREATH THE FRAGRANCE OF FUTURE SONGS ALREADY GLOWEST THOU AND DREAMEST ALREADY DRINKEST THOU THIRSTILY AT ALL DEEP ECHOING WELLS OF CONSOLATION ALREADY REPOSETH THY MELANCHOLY IN THE BLISS OF FUTURE SONGS O MY SOUL NOW HAVE I GIVEN THEE ALL AND EVEN MY LAST POSSESSION AND ALL MY HANDS HAVE BECOME EMPTY BY THEE:--THAT I BADE THEE SING BEHOLD THAT WAS MY LAST THING TO GIVE
UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY BEFORE US THE BOUNDARIES OF WHICH NO ONE HAS YET SEEN A BEYOND TO ALL COUNTRIES AND CORNERS OF THE IDEAL KNOWN HITHERTO A WORLD SO OVER-RICH IN THE BEAUTIFUL THE STRANGE THE QUESTIONABLE THE FRIGHTFUL AND THE DIVINE THAT OUR CURIOSITY AS WELL AS OUR THIRST FOR POSSESSION THEREOF HAVE GOT OUT OF HAND--ALAS
AND THE GATEWAY
ALL THESE HEAVIEST THINGS THE LOAD-BEARING SPIRIT TAKETH UPON ITSELF
WHAT IS GOOD YE ASK
FOR VICTORY WILL IT STRUGGLE WITH THE GREAT DRAGON
THEN THE INVALID BECAME A HERETIC OR SORCERER
LET YOUR SORROW BE LOVE TO THE SUPERMAN
FELLOW-SUFFERING HOWEVER IS THE DEEPEST ABYSS
THAT WAY IS BAD
HUMAN PAIN HOWEVER IS THE SOREST PAIN
SPIT ON THIS CITY OF SHOPMEN AND RETURN BACK
THITHER WHERE GODS ARE ASHAMED OF ALL CLOTHES
AND WHEN YE TAKE THEN IS IT LIKE STEALING YE SMALL VIRTUOUS ONES
BUT THAT BIRD BUILT ITS NEST BESIDE ME
IN OURSELVES DWELLETH HE STILL THE OLD IDOL-PRIEST WHO BROILETH OUR BEST FOR HIS BANQUET
A SMALL REVENGE IS HUMANER THAN NO REVENGE AT ALL
THEREWITH HATH HE SILENCED THE MOLE AND THE DWARF WHO SAY
AND IN SPITE OF ALL ZARATHUSTRA'S EFFORTS TO LIFT HIM AND SET HIM AGAIN ON HIS FEET IT WAS ALL IN VAIN
THEY BECOME THANKFUL
THEREFORE SAID I
AND STEALING YET MORE BLESSED THAN TAKING?'--THAT WAS FORSAKENNESS
MODEST IS EVEN THE THIEF IN PRESENCE OF SLEEP
WHO WISHETH TO DECEIVE ME
CONFUSION OF LANGUAGE OF GOOD AND EVIL
O ZARATHUSTRA THOU ART MORE PIOUS THAN THOU BELIEVEST WITH SUCH AN UNBELIEF
ON THAT ACCOUNT HAD YE TO DIE YOUNG AND FAR TOO EARLY
BUT WHO WOULD CALL IT PASSION WHEN THE HEIGHT LONGETH TO STOOP FOR POWER
THE NIGHT-SONG
THE NIGHT-SONG
TO THIS CLASS ALL THAT IS AWFUL IS BAD IN FACT IT IS THE EVIL PAR EXCELLENCE
IT MAY HAVE BEEN WELL FOR THE PREACHER OF THE PETTY PEOPLE TO SUFFER AND BE BURDENED BY MEN'S SIN
IT RETURNETH ONLY IT COMETH HOME TO ME AT LAST--MINE OWN SELF AND SUCH OF IT AS HATH BEEN LONG ABROAD AND SCATTERED AMONG THINGS AND ACCIDENTS
NIETZSCHE WAS NOT AN ICONOCLAST FROM PREDILECTION
WHAT WOULD BE MY LOVE TO THE SUPERMAN IF I SPAKE OTHERWISE
IF I MUST BE PITIFUL I DISLIKE TO BE CALLED SO
DOTH ZARATHUSTRA STILL LIVE
THE SONG OF MELANCHOLY
THE SONG OF MELANCHOLY
THE SONG OF MELANCHOLY
DO NOT WILL ANYTHING BEYOND YOUR POWER
FOR ME--HOW COULD THERE BE AN OUTSIDE-OF-ME
AH THIS SOMBRE NOCTURNAL VEXATION
AND WHEN MINE EYE FLEETH FROM THE PRESENT TO THE BYGONE IT FINDETH EVER THE SAME
THOU ART HARD THOU WISE ZARATHUSTRA
LIGHT IS IT VERILY FEATHER-LIGHT
DOTH THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE WITH WOMEN NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE
ALSO SHOULDST THOU FIND NEW HONEY WITH ME ICE-COLD GOLDEN-COMB-HONEY EAT IT
OF WHOM DOST THOU SPEAK SAID SHE
MORE UPRIGHTLY AND PURELY SPEAKETH THE HEALTHY BODY PERFECT AND SQUARE-BUILT
AND THAT THEY ARE ON THE WAY TO ME
AND WHICH OF US POETS HATH NOT ADULTERATED HIS WINE
THEY ALL SPEAK OF ME WHEN THEY SIT AROUND THEIR FIRE IN THE EVENING--THEY SPEAK OF ME BUT NO ONE THINKETH--OF ME
THEN BEGAN HE ANEW
BLOW AGAIN CONTINUE BELLOWS-BOX OF VIRTUE
THE SIGN COMETH SAID ZARATHUSTRA AND A CHANGE CAME OVER HIS HEART
THE MOON HATH ITS COURT AND THE COURT HATH ITS MOON-CALVES
HE SPEAKETH ACTUALLY OUT OF THE HEART OF THE EARTH
AH THAT IT SHOULD SLUMBER IN THE HARDEST UGLIEST STONE
AND THOUGH ONE BE A TRIER OF THE REINS WHO STILL BELIEVETH THAT YE HAVE REINS
SURPRISED AND PALE DOTH IT STAND--BEFORE THE ROSY DAWN
THAT DOTH HE HERE TEACH US IN THE PLAINEST PARABLE
GIVE US THIS LAST MAN O ZARATHUSTRA,"--THEY CALLED OUT--"MAKE US INTO THESE LAST MEN
WHERE I MUST WILL WITH MY WHOLE WILL
THUS FOR THE SAKE OF HIS VIRTUE HE IS WILLING TO LIVE ON OR LIVE NO MORE
AND THIS ALSO DID I LEARN AMONG THEM
ALL THAT TEACHING ABOUT THE ONE AND THE PLENUM AND THE UNMOVED AND THE SUFFICIENT AND THE IMPERISHABLE
THERE DO I LAUGH AT MY STERN GUEST AND AM STILL FOND OF HIM
CREATING ONES WERE FIRST OF ALL PEOPLES AND ONLY IN LATE TIMES INDIVIDUALS
THUS DID TIME PASS WITH ME AND SLIP BY IF TIME THERE STILL WAS
WHO STILL WANTETH TO RULE
FOR AS YET DO I AWAIT THE SIGNS THAT IT IS TIME FOR MY DOWN-GOING
THEN KNEELETH IT DOWN LIKE THE CAMEL AND WANTETH TO BE WELL LADEN
BECAUSE HE CLEARETH MY HOUSE OF FLIES AND QUIETETH MANY LITTLE NOISES
IN THE EVENING WILT THOU HAVE ME AGAIN
I FEAR THAT ON ONE OCCASION TO AVOID BAD SMELLS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I ACTUALLY INQUIRED AT THE PALAZZO DEL QUIRINALE WHETHER THEY COULD NOT PROVIDE A QUIET ROOM FOR A PHILOSOPHER
A GREAT MAN I WANTED TO APPEAR AND PERSUADED MANY
FOR THAT THE SUPERMAN MAY NOT LACK HIS DRAGON THE SUPERDRAGON THAT IS WORTHY OF HIM THERE MUST STILL MUCH WARM SUN GLOW ON MOIST VIRGIN FORESTS
ALAS HOW SHALL I PRESERVE MY LIGHT THROUGH IT
LIKE A HARD BED HOWEVER A CAMP-BED
THEY ARE ALL SICK AND SORE THROUGH PUBLIC OPINION
A NIETZSCHE AND MORALITY
WHAT DO I SEEK ON THE HEIGHT
THEIR WISDOM SPEAKETH THUS
AND IF YE CANNOT BE SAINTS OF KNOWLEDGE THEN I PRAY YOU BE AT LEAST ITS WARRIORS
MAN IS EVIL"--SO SAID TO ME FOR CONSOLATION ALL THE WISEST ONES
HOW I DISTRUST ALL OF YOU
7
7
7

YE SIGNIFY STEPS
ALREADY COMETH THE EVENING
THE LAND OF CULTURE
THE LAND OF CULTURE
THE LAND OF CULTURE
AWAY WITH THEE!"--UNTIL A VOICE CRIETH OUT OF THEMSELVES
O HAVEN UPON HIGH SEAS
SHOULD HE BECOME WEARY OF HIS SUBLIMENESS THIS SUBLIME ONE THEN ONLY WILL HIS BEAUTY BEGIN--AND THEN ONLY WILL I TASTE HIM AND FIND HIM SAVOURY
THEN DIDST THOU SLAY MY RAPTURE WITH THY TONES
AND NOW DO THEY LOOK AT ME AND LAUGH
TO THEIR BODY AND THIS EARTH
CULTURE THEY CALL THEIR THEFT--AND EVERYTHING BECOMETH SICKNESS AND TROUBLE UNTO THEM
NOT A STEP FURTHER WILL HE GO,--THIS BRAVE ONE
AND THE FOREBODING TOUCHED HIS HEART AND TRANSFORMED HIM
NAMELY THE HIGHER MAN WHEN THE KINGS HEARD THIS THEY BEAT UPON THEIR BREASTS AND SAID WITH ONE VOICE
THEN SHALL MANY THINGS BE REVEALED
A WORD AT THE RIGHT TIME
THE BEST TURNED WEARY OF THEIR WORKS
NOW NIETZSCHE BELIEVED THAT THE FIRST OR THE NOBLE-MORALITY CONDUCED TO AN ASCENT IN THE LINE OF LIFE
THAT WHICH NOW CALLETH ITSELF THE PEOPLE IS UNWORTHY OF KINGS
MINE EARS HAVE ALREADY ENDURED WORSE AND HAVE NOT BECOME PEEVISH
FOR EVIDENTLY THEY WERE VERY PEACEABLE KINGS WHOM HE SAW BEFORE HIM KINGS WITH OLD AND REFINED FEATURES
THEN HAVE I TO GO INTO THE OPEN AIR AND AWAY FROM ALL DUSTY ROOMS
O MIRACLE
AT LAST HE SAID SORROWFULLY
PERHAPS I DARE NOT BELIEVE IN GOD
IT IS NOT A MAN HE HATH CAUGHT BUT A CORPSE
BUT I ALSO--AM A SOOTHSAYER THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
VERILY IN BROAD DAYLIGHT DID HE FALL ASLEEP THE SLUGGARD
THEN DID THEY RUSH UP TO ZARATHUSTRA THANKING HONOURING CARESSING HIM AND KISSING HIS HANDS EACH IN HIS OWN PECULIAR WAY
IT IS DIFFICULT TO LIVE AMONG MEN BECAUSE SILENCE IS SO DIFFICULT
WITH HIM PLAY ALL THE WAVES
HE ALWAYS STEALETH SOFTLY THROUGH THE NIGHT
COOL DOWN HERE OUTSIDE YOUR HOT CHILD-WANTONNESS AND HEART-TUMULT
THINE OVER-ABUNDANCE ITSELF NOW STRETCHETH OUT LONGING HANDS
ZARATHUSTRA WENT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ALONE NO ONE MEETING HIM
SO DOTH THE LION-WILL WISH ITSELF
WHAT GOOD IS IT
TO HAVE A SHELL AND A FINE APPEARANCE AND SAGACIOUS BLINDNESS
TO THE CLEAN ARE ALL THINGS CLEAN"--THUS SAY THE PEOPLE
PRODUCED BY SUE ASSCHER THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA A BOOK FOR ALL AND NONE BY FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE TRANSLATED BY THOMAS COMMON PG EDITOR'S NOTE
BUT THOU THYSELF--HAST GIVEN ME NO SMALL PROOF OF THYSELF
ONE NO LONGER BECOMETH POOR OR RICH
ALAS HOW THAT LAUGHING LACERATED MY BOWELS AND CUT INTO MY HEART
JUST NOW HOWEVER A CRY OF DISTRESS CALLETH ME HASTILY AWAY FROM THEE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
COME
COME
COME
COME
COME
IT CONCERNETH THEE LITTLE WHAT SEEMETH STRAIGHT OR CROOKED UNTO US MEN
IN VERSES 15 AND 16 WE HAVE NIETZSCHE DECLARING HIMSELF AN EVOLUTIONIST IN THE BROADEST SENSE--THAT IS TO SAY THAT HE BELIEVES IN THE DEVELOPMENT HYPOTHESIS AS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS BY WHICH SPECIES HAVE ORIGINATED
WITHOUT A SUGGESTION OF FATIGUE I COULD THEN WALK FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS ON END AMONG THE HILLS
ALL AT ONCE HOWEVER HE TURNED HIS HEAD QUICKLY FOR HE SEEMED TO HEAR SOMETHING
WHAT HATH NOT THE SKIN OF MY HUMILITY ENDURED
HIS DEATH DIETH THE CONSUMMATING ONE TRIUMPHANTLY SURROUNDED BY HOPING AND PROMISING ONES
BUT ALL LIFE IS A DISPUTE ABOUT TASTE AND TASTING
THEY MOCKED ME WHEN I FOUND AND WALKED IN MINE OWN PATH
BEING A GREAT MAN HIMSELF HE WAS WELL AWARE OF THE DANGERS THREATENING GREATNESS IN OUR AGE
AND WHOEVER WANTETH TO HAVE FAME MUST TAKE LEAVE OF HONOUR BETIMES AND PRACTISE THE DIFFICULT ART OF--GOING AT THE RIGHT TIME
THOU OLD CLOCK-BELL THOU SWEET LYRE
AND BY STILL GREATER ONES THAN ANY OF THE SAVIOURS MUST YE BE SAVED MY BRETHREN IF YE WOULD FIND THE WAY TO FREEDOM
LIKE THEE DOTH IT LIKE TO SPEAK WITH SMOKE AND ROARING--TO MAKE BELIEVE LIKE THEE THAT IT SPEAKETH OUT OF THE HEART OF THINGS
OF ITS OWN LAW MUST IT BECOME THE JUDGE AND AVENGER AND VICTIM
THERE IS A BAD FALSENESS IN THOSE WHO WILL BEYOND THEIR POWER
WEAPONS SHALL THEY BE AND SOUNDING SIGNS THAT LIFE MUST AGAIN AND AGAIN SURPASS ITSELF
I WANTED TO GO TO AQUILA--THE OPPOSITE OF ROME IN EVERY RESPECT AND ACTUALLY FOUNDED IN A SPIRIT OF ENMITY TOWARDS THAT CITY JUST AS I ALSO SHALL FOUND A CITY SOME DAY AS A MEMENTO OF AN ATHEIST AND GENUINE ENEMY OF THE CHURCH--A PERSON VERY CLOSELY RELATED TO ME,--THE GREAT HOHENSTAUFEN THE EMPEROR FREDERICK II
WILL YE NOT LIKE ME SAY UNTO DEATH
AND NOW YE FAMOUS WISE ONES I WOULD HAVE YOU FINALLY THROW OFF ENTIRELY THE SKIN OF THE LION
THE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE
THE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE
NO LONGER TO THRUST ONE'S HEAD INTO THE SAND OF CELESTIAL THINGS BUT TO CARRY IT FREELY A TERRESTRIAL HEAD WHICH GIVETH MEANING TO THE EARTH
THIS CURSE UPON YOU MINE ENEMIES
AND WHO COULD DIVINE WHAT THOUGHTS THEN PASSED THROUGH ZARATHUSTRA'S SOUL
AND MANY OF THEM GO FORWARD AND LOOK BACKWARDS THEREBY WITH STIFFENED NECKS
THE BROAD ALTRUISM OF THE LAW-GIVER THINKING OVER VAST ERAS OF TIME WAS CONTINUALLY BEING PITTED BY NIETZSCHE IN HIMSELF AGAINST THAT TRANSIENT AND MEANER SYMPATHY FOR THE NEIGHBOUR WHICH HE MORE PERHAPS THAN ANY OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HAD SUFFERED FROM BUT WHICH HE WAS CERTAIN INVOLVED ENORMOUS DANGERS NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF BUT ALSO TO THE NEXT AND SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS SEE NOTE B WHERE PITY IS MENTIONED AMONG THE DEGENERATE VIRTUES LATER IN THE BOOK WE SHALL SEE HOW HIS PROFOUND COMPASSION LEADS HIM INTO TEMPTATION AND HOW FRANTICALLY HE STRUGGLES AGAINST IT
FELLOW-SUFFERING WITH THE HIGHER MEN HE CRIED OUT AND HIS COUNTENANCE CHANGED INTO BRASS
HUNGRY FIERCE LONESOME GOD-FORSAKEN
THAT IS THE WAY WITH OLD PEOPLE
BUT TO ALL THOSE COMETH NOW THE DAY THE CHANGE THE SWORD OF JUDGMENT THE GREAT NOONTIDE
BESTOWING VIRTUE"--THUS DID ZARATHUSTRA ONCE NAME THE UNNAMABLE
THE TARANTULAS ARE THE SOCIALISTS AND DEMOCRATS
AT LAST HOWEVER HE BECAME OLD AND SOFT AND MELLOW AND PITIFUL MORE LIKE A GRANDFATHER THAN A FATHER BUT MOST LIKE A TOTTERING OLD GRANDMOTHER
I HAVE FALLEN MYSELF OVERSWINGING
HOW HE LONGED IN THOSE DAYS FOR THE IDEAL FRIEND WHO WOULD THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND HIM TO WHOM HE WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY ALL AND WHOM HE IMAGINED HE HAD FOUND AT VARIOUS PERIODS IN HIS LIFE FROM HIS EARLIEST YOUTH ONWARDS
NOW BE YE FRIENDS THE HEIRS OF MY GOAL
YE DESPAIRING ONES
AROUND THE DEVISERS OF NEW VALUES REVOLVETH THE WORLD:--INVISIBLY IT REVOLVETH
VERILY THEY THEMSELVES NEVER TROD THE CARPETS OF KNOWLEDGE
HE SAYS HE WOULD HE WERE AS WISE AS HIS SERPENT
BUT HE MEANETH BLUNT LANGUAGE AND BLUNTLY'--WELL
THE RETURN HOME
THE RETURN HOME
THE RETURN HOME
HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ARGUED THAT WE ONLY SEE THE SUCCESSFUL CASES
CHAPTER LII
BODY AM I AND SOUL"--SO SAITH THE CHILD

HOW HATH THAT HAPPENED UNTO HIM
RAVING OF THE REASON WAS LIKENESS TO GOD AND DOUBT WAS SIN
MY LAST SIN WHICH HATH BEEN RESERVED FOR ME,--KNOWEST THOU WHAT IT IS CALLED PITY ANSWERED THE SOOTHSAYER FROM AN OVERFLOWING HEART AND RAISED BOTH HIS HANDS ALOFT--"O ZARATHUSTRA I HAVE COME THAT I MAY SEDUCE THEE TO THY LAST SIN AND HARDLY HAD THOSE WORDS BEEN UTTERED WHEN THERE SOUNDED THE CRY ONCE MORE AND LONGER AND MORE ALARMING THAN BEFORE--ALSO MUCH NEARER
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER SPAKE THUS
THUS DID THE SEA GIVE A STONE TO THE HUNGRY ONE
AND VERILY WHERE THERE IS SUCCUMBING AND LEAF-FALLING LO THERE DOTH LIFE SACRIFICE ITSELF--FOR POWER
I STRANGLED EVEN THE STRANGLER CALLED SIN O MY SOUL I GAVE THEE THE RIGHT TO SAY NAY LIKE THE STORM AND TO SAY YEA AS THE OPEN HEAVEN SAITH YEA
PERHAPS AS LARGE A FACTOR AS THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE SEE PAGES 134 141 OF VOL
BUT HE WHO HATH BECOME WEARY IS HIMSELF MERELY WILLED
ZARATHUSTRA AND THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE JOIN ISSUE AT THE END ON THE QUESTION OF THE PROPER PLACE OF FEAR IN MAN'S HISTORY AND NIETZSCHE AVAILS HIMSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITY IN ORDER TO RESTATE HIS VIEWS CONCERNING THE RELATION OF COURAGE TO HUMANITY
AND LEAST HAVE I HITHERTO BEEN HEARD BY THE MOST LEARNED
WOULD THAT HE MIGHT NEVER BE BORN!--THUS DO I ADVISE THE SUPERFLUOUS ONES
THEY WALK WARILY
THEY VOMIT THEIR BILE AND CALL IT A NEWSPAPER
YE OLD SEAMAN-HEARTS
A GOOD WIND
WILL TO EXISTENCE
IT WAS THY GOOD FORTUNE TO BE LAUGHED AT
LOOKING BACK NOW I FIND THAT EXACTLY TWO MONTHS PREVIOUS TO THIS INSPIRATION I HAD HAD AN OMEN OF ITS COMING IN THE FORM OF A SUDDEN AND DECISIVE ALTERATION IN MY TASTES--MORE PARTICULARLY IN MUSIC
YE ALSO NOW GO AWAY AND ALONE
AND AT THAT TIME HE ABODE IN THE TOWN WHICH IS CALLED THE PIED COW
WHERE IS THERE STILL A SEA IN WHICH ONE COULD BE DROWNED SO SOUNDETH OUR PLAINT--ACROSS SHALLOW SWAMPS
THE INEVITABLE SUPERFICIALITY OF THE RABBLE IS CONTRASTED WITH THE PEACEFUL AND PROFOUND DEPTHS OF THE ANCHORITE
THE PITIFUL
THE PITIFUL
LET THIS BE THE SIGNIFICANCE AND THE TRUTH OF THY MARRIAGE
AND ANEW ZARATHUSTRA THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
WHEN THOU SATTEST IN THINE ISLE A WELL OF WINE GIVING AND GRANTING AMONGST EMPTY BUCKETS BESTOWING AND DISTRIBUTING AMONGST THE THIRSTY
ZARATHUSTRA'S INTERVIEW WITH THE FIRE-DOG IS HOWEVER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
WHAT STRANGE INTERLOCUTORS HAVE I FOUND
THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY IN WHICH THE GREAT MAN CAN ACHIEVE GREATNESS IS BY MEANS OF EXCEPTIONAL FREEDOM--THE FREEDOM WHICH ASSISTS HIM IN EXPERIENCING HIMSELF
WHEN THE MORNING DAWNED HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA FOUND HIMSELF IN A THICK FOREST AND NO PATH WAS ANY LONGER VISIBLE
INNOCENT ARE WE TO EACH OTHER IN OUR FAITHLESSNESS
AND SOON SHALL THEY STAND BEFORE ME LIKE DRY GRASS AND PRAIRIE AND VERILY WEARY OF THEMSELVES--AND PANTING FOR FIRE MORE THAN FOR WATER
THE SHADOW OF HIS HAND DANCETH UPON IT
TO THE INCURABLE SHALL ONE NOT SEEK TO BE A PHYSICIAN
SO CAUSETH THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY
MERELY POET
YOUR HIGHEST THOUGHT HOWEVER YE SHALL HAVE IT COMMANDED UNTO YOU BY ME--AND IT IS THIS
YE DO NOT YET SUFFER ENOUGH FOR ME
BUT I DO NOT LIKE THOSE STRAINED SOULS
IS NOT THE SEA THE PEACOCK OF PEACOCKS
AND ALREADY YE HIGHER MEN--LET ME TICKLE YOU WITH THIS COMPLIMENTARY AND FLATTERING NAME AS HE HIMSELF DOETH--ALREADY DOTH MINE EVIL SPIRIT OF DECEIT AND MAGIC ATTACK ME MY MELANCHOLY DEVIL WHICH IS AN ADVERSARY TO THIS ZARATHUSTRA FROM THE VERY HEART
BUT WHAT MATTER ABOUT A TIME THAT HATH NO TIME FOR ZARATHUSTRA
TOO LONG DID MY SOUL SIT HUNGRY AT THEIR TABLE
NOT AT ALL SAID ZARATHUSTRA AS YET HAST THOU NOT RECEIVED MY THANKS
TO MYSELF HAVE YE GIVEN THIS POWER,--A GOOD GIFT MINE HONOURABLE GUESTS
OR A SUBJUGATOR
THUS SHOULD HE ALSO SURMOUNT HIS REPOSE
FAR FROM ME ALSO BE THE GOD WHO LIMPETH THITHER TO BLESS WHAT HE HATH NOT MATCHED
OH WHEN SHALL I ARRIVE AGAIN AT MY HOME WHERE I SHALL NO LONGER HAVE TO STOOP--SHALL NO LONGER HAVE TO STOOP BEFORE THE SMALL ONES!"--AND ZARATHUSTRA SIGHED AND GAZED INTO THE DISTANCE THE SAME DAY HOWEVER HE GAVE HIS DISCOURSE ON THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE
FEEL PLEASURE THEREUPON IT REJOICETH AND THINKETH HOW IT MAY OFTTIMES REJOICE--AND FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE IT IS MEANT TO THINK
AND WHENEVER IT COMMANDETH THE LIVING THING RISKETH ITSELF THEREBY
I DID IT ONLY FOR AMUSEMENT
HE AT ONCE SNATCHED THE HARP FROM THE MAGICIAN AND CALLED OUT
NEITHER IN THE INCONCEIVABLE COULD YE HAVE BEEN BORN NOR IN THE IRRATIONAL
HOW IT GROANETH WITH EVIL RECOLLECTIONS
THOU ART FALSE
WHERE ART THOU GONE
AND WHERE THERE IS GREAT LOVE TO ONESELF THEN IS IT THE SIGN OF PREGNANCY
YE SHALL BE THOSE WHOSE EYES EVER SEEK FOR AN ENEMY--FOR YOUR ENEMY
AND FOR LONG HE WOULD NEITHER EAT NOR DRINK
WE HAVE DISCOVERED HAPPINESS"--SAY THE LAST MEN AND BLINK THEREBY
YE HIGHER MEN THINK YE THAT I AM HERE TO PUT RIGHT WHAT YE HAVE PUT WRONG
NOT ONLY ONE SUN HAD SET FOR ME
ONE CANNOT CHANGE A CONDITION OF THIS SORT IN A DAY
BUT TO THE SHEEP I AM NO LONGER A SCHOLAR
AT THE CULPRITS OF RICHES WITH COLD EYES AND RANK THOUGHTS WHO PICK UP PROFIT OUT OF ALL KINDS OF RUBBISH--AT THIS RABBLE THAT STINKETH TO HEAVEN AT THIS GILDED FALSIFIED POPULACE WHOSE FATHERS WERE PICKPOCKETS OR CARRION-CROWS OR RAG-PICKERS WITH WIVES COMPLIANT LEWD AND FORGETFUL:--FOR THEY ARE ALL OF THEM NOT FAR DIFFERENT FROM HARLOTS POPULACE ABOVE POPULACE BELOW
THOUGH ALAS
THERE WELLETH UP MYSTERIOUSLY AN ODOUR A PERFUME AND ODOUR OF ETERNITY A ROSY-BLESSED BROWN GOLD-WINE-ODOUR OF OLD HAPPINESS OF DRUNKEN MIDNIGHT-DEATH HAPPINESS WHICH SINGETH
THE KING ON THE RIGHT HOWEVER ANSWERED HIM IN THEIR NAME
FLEE MY FRIEND INTO THY SOLITUDE
FLEE MY FRIEND INTO THY SOLITUDE
AND LET THE STREAM OF MY LOVE SWEEP INTO UNFREQUENTED CHANNELS
ONE SHOULD HOLD FAST ONE'S HEART
WHAT DO I KNOW
THY SPEECH HATH BECOME RIPE RIPE LIKE THE GOLDEN AUTUMN AND THE AFTERNOON LIKE MINE ANCHORITE HEART--NOW SAYEST THOU
THIS LIKE THE WANDERER IS ONE OF THE MANY INTROSPECTIVE PASSAGES IN THE WORK AND IS FULL OF INNUENDOS AND HINTS AS TO THE NIETZSCHEAN OUTLOOK ON LIFE
THOU UNKNOWN ONE!--THIEF
THERE FINDETH HE THAT IS MOST HIDDEN HIS HIDING-PLACE
BRIGHTNESS OF MIDNIGHT WAS EVER AROUND ME
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA WAS AGAIN ON THE CONTINENT HE DID NOT GO STRAIGHTWAY TO HIS MOUNTAINS AND HIS CAVE BUT MADE MANY WANDERINGS AND QUESTIONINGS AND ASCERTAINED THIS AND THAT
THEY STEAL THE WORKS OF THE INVENTORS AND THE TREASURES OF THE WISE
THEREFORE THERE ARE NO GODS
FILTH IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR SOULS
NAKED WOULD I LIKE TO SEE THEM
AND IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME CHAPTER LXXIX
BUT ONE DAY WILL I TAKE THEM UP AND PUT EACH BY ITSELF ALONE
TO SEE THESE LIGHT FOOLISH PRETTY LIVELY LITTLE SPRITES FLIT ABOUT--THAT MOVETH ZARATHUSTRA TO TEARS AND SONGS
O ZARATHUSTRA HE WHO HATH TO REMOVE MOUNTAINS REMOVETH ALSO VALLEYS AND PLAINS AND I ANSWERED
AND EXILED AM I FROM FATHERLANDS AND MOTHERLANDS
PENALTY SO CALLETH ITSELF REVENGE
IN YOU THERE IS MUCH TO BE LAUGHED AT AND ESPECIALLY YOUR FEAR OF WHAT HATH HITHERTO BEEN CALLED THE DEVIL SO ALIEN ARE YE IN YOUR SOULS TO WHAT IS GREAT THAT TO YOU THE SUPERMAN WOULD BE FRIGHTFUL IN HIS GOODNESS
AND HOW MUCH HONEY OF HOPE DID I CARRY HENCE INTO MY BEEHIVES
SO THAT IT BECOMETH CREATOR AND VALUER AND LOVER AND EVERYTHING'S BENEFACTOR
KNOWEST THOU NOT WHO IS MOST NEEDED BY ALL
BUT NOT LONG HAD THEY RUN THUS WHEN ZARATHUSTRA BECAME CONSCIOUS OF HIS FOLLY AND SHOOK OFF WITH ONE JERK ALL HIS IRRITATION AND DETESTATION
AND CLIMBED I MOUNTAINS WHOM DID I EVER SEEK IF NOT THEE UPON MOUNTAINS
MAINTAIN HOLY THY HIGHEST HOPE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
THEY COMMISERATE ALSO MY ACCIDENTS AND CHANCES:--BUT MY WORD SAITH
WHAT KNOWETH HE OF LOVE WHO HATH NOT BEEN OBLIGED TO DESPISE JUST WHAT HE LOVED
THEN SEE TO IT THAT THEY ACCEPT THY TREASURES
LAUGHABLE VERILY IS MY FOLLY AND MY MODESTY IN LOVE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND LAUGHED THEREBY A SECOND TIME
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ONE OF THEM TO WRITE A LINE ON THE SUBJECT HOWEVER KINDLY HE MAY DO SO WITHOUT BEING SUSPECTED OF WISHING TO OPEN A CRUSADE AGAINST THE FAIR SEX
HOW WELL YE KNOW WHAT CONSOLATION I DEVISED FOR MYSELF IN SEVEN DAYS
SO THAT HIS FIRST COMPANIONS MUST BE CORPSES AND BUFFOONS
NO GAME-SPOILER HATH COME TO YOU WITH EVIL EYE NO ENEMY OF MAIDENS
WONDERFUL TRULY
FOR THE STARS THIRSTETH THY SOUL
IT IS THE GOOD WAR THAT HALLOWETH EVERY CAUSE O ZARATHUSTRA OUR FATHERS BLOOD STIRRED IN OUR VEINS AT SUCH WORDS
ETERNALLY HE RETURNETH THE MAN OF WHOM THOU ART WEARY THE SMALL MAN"--SO YAWNED MY SADNESS AND DRAGGED ITS FOOT AND COULD NOT GO TO SLEEP
IF THERE BE A GOD HE TOO MUST BE EVADED
AH WHOSE EYE HATH NOT BEDIMMED IN THIS INTOXICATED TWILIGHT
MARRIAGE THEY CALL IT ALL
THE SOOTHSAYER WHO HAD PERCEIVED WHAT WENT ON IN ZARATHUSTRA'S SOUL WIPED HIS FACE WITH HIS HAND AS IF HE WOULD WIPE OUT THE IMPRESSION
ABOVE IT ALL HOWEVER THERE SOARS TRANSFIGURING IT THE IMAGE OF HIS GREATEST HOPES AND REMOTEST AIMS
I LOVE HIM WHO DESIRETH NOT TOO MANY VIRTUES
NIETZSCHE REFUSES TO BE CONFOUNDED WITH THOSE RESENTFUL AND REVENGEFUL ONES WHO CONDEMN SOCIETY FROM BELOW AND WHOSE CRITICISM IS ONLY SUPPRESSED ENVY
YE FLEE UNTO YOUR NEIGHBOUR FROM YOURSELVES AND WOULD FAIN MAKE A VIRTUE THEREOF
BUT BEHOLD THESE KINE THUS SPAKE THE PREACHER-ON-THE-MOUNT AND TURNED THEN HIS OWN LOOK TOWARDS ZARATHUSTRA--FOR HITHERTO IT HAD RESTED LOVINGLY ON THE KINE
UNEXHAUSTED AND UNDISCOVERED IS STILL MAN AND MAN'S WORLD
BUT NEVERTHELESS I WALK WITH MY THOUGHTS ABOVE THEIR HEADS
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD SAID THIS TO HIS HEART HE PUT THE CORPSE UPON HIS SHOULDERS AND SET OUT ON HIS WAY
BUT HE RESTRAINED HIMSELF
THE VOICE OF THE HERD WILL STILL ECHO IN THEE
FLEE MY FRIEND INTO THY SOLITUDE--AND THITHER WHERE A ROUGH STRONG BREEZE BLOWETH
C NIETZSCHE AND EVOLUTION
LIKE THE SAIL TREMBLING WITH THE VIOLENCE OF THE SPIRIT DOTH MY WISDOM CROSS THE SEA--MY WILD WISDOM
STEAMETH NOT THIS CITY WITH THE FUMES OF SLAUGHTERED SPIRIT
HATH THE WILL BEEN UNHARNESSED FROM ITS OWN FOLLY
BUT THIS WILL NOT ENTER YOUR EARS
AND HE WHO WISHED TO SLEEP WELL SPAKE OF GOOD AND BAD ERE RETIRING TO REST
EATING LAMB IS EVIL B THE MASTER AND SLAVE-MORALITY COMPARED
NOW SAYEST THOU TO ME SMILING AND FULL OF MELANCHOLY
CERTAINLY THIS IS ONE ASPECT OF A CERTAIN KIND OF ATHEISM--THE ATHEISM OF THE MAN WHO REVERES BEAUTY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HIS OWN UGLINESS WHICH OUTRAGES HIM MUST BE CONCEALED FROM EVERY EYE LEST IT SHOULD NOT BE RESPECTED AS ZARATHUSTRA RESPECTED IT
EVERYTHING GOETH EVERYTHING RETURNETH
HE HEARD ANEW THE GREAT CRY OF DISTRESS
I PERSONALLY CAN NO LONGER HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT NIETZSCHE'S ONLY OBJECT IN THAT PART OF HIS PHILOSOPHY WHERE HE BIDS HIS FRIENDS STAND BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL WITH HIM WAS TO SAVE HIGHER MEN WHOSE GROWTH AND SCOPE MIGHT BE LIMITED BY THE TOO STRICT OBSERVANCE OF MODERN VALUES FROM FOUNDERING ON THE ROCKS OF A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THEIR OWN GENIUS AND TRADITIONAL CONVENTIONS
YE STRIVE LIKE ME FOR THE BESTOWING VIRTUE
THEN WAS HE SEIZED WITH THE LONGING FOR DEATH
THIS LOATHING CHOKETH ME THAT WE KINGS OURSELVES HAVE BECOME FALSE DRAPED AND DISGUISED WITH THE OLD FADED POMP OF OUR ANCESTORS SHOW-PIECES FOR THE STUPIDEST THE CRAFTIEST AND WHOSOEVER AT PRESENT TRAFFICKETH FOR POWER
AS IF THERE WERE BUT ONE FOOT-BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE
THITHER STRIVETH OUR HELM WHERE OUR CHILDREN'S LAND IS
THEREWITH HAVE THEY MADE THE WOLF A DOG AND MAN HIMSELF MAN'S BEST DOMESTIC ANIMAL
FURTHEST TO BE SURE HAVE THOSE KINE CARRIED IT
LO HERE IS A WELL FOR MANY THIRSTY ONES ONE HEART FOR MANY LONGING ONES ONE WILL FOR MANY INSTRUMENTS":--AROUND HIM COLLECTETH A PEOPLE THAT IS TO SAY MANY ATTEMPTING ONES
THESE HAVE ALREADY BEEN REFERRED TO IN THE NOTES ON CHAPTERS LVII
WITH FIFTY PATCHES PAINTED ON FACES AND LIMBS--SO SAT YE THERE TO MINE ASTONISHMENT YE PRESENT-DAY MEN
WHEN YOUR HEART OVERFLOWETH BROAD AND FULL LIKE THE RIVER A BLESSING AND A DANGER TO THE LOWLANDERS
I DO NOT WISH TO CONDUCT IT AWAY
HOW THE SPIRIT BECAME A CAMEL THE CAMEL A LION AND THE LION AT LAST A CHILD THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
LOST IT
HOW DOTH THIS HAPPEN
HENCE HIS EARNEST ADVOCACY OF NOBLE-MORALITY
WHO IS THE MAN INTO WHOSE THROAT ALL THE HEAVIEST AND BLACKEST WILL THUS CRAWL
WELL ALSO DO THE POOR IN SPIRIT PLEASE ME
SEE THAT A STILL WORSE EVENING DOTH NOT OVERTAKE THEE THE DANGER ZARATHUSTRA REFERS TO IS PRECISELY THIS THAT EVEN A PRISON MAY SEEM A BLESSING TO SUCH A MAN
HE WHO LEADETH HIS SHEEP TO THE GREENEST PASTURE SHALL ALWAYS BE FOR ME THE BEST SHEPHERD
THOU WOULDST SPEAK AND WITHOUT TREMBLING BUOYANT RATHER WITH BLISS FOR A GREAT WEIGHT AND WORRY WOULD BE TAKEN FROM THEE THOU PATIENTEST ONE NOW DO I DIE AND DISAPPEAR WOULDST THOU SAY AND IN A MOMENT I AM NOTHING
IT IS MINE ALSO IN THE AUTUMN OF 1883 MY BROTHER LEFT THE ENGADINE FOR GERMANY AND STAYED THERE A FEW WEEKS
IN BLACK DRAPED THEY THEIR CORPSES
THIS TALK IS FOR FINE EARS FOR THINE EARS--WHAT SAITH DEEP MIDNIGHT'S VOICE INDEED
THE PRESENT AND THE BYGONE UPON EARTH--AH
16 17 18 19 20 CHAPTER XL
I LOVE FAST RACING
THIS IS MY SERMON FOR THEIR EARS
THAT WHICH IS GREAT THE ACUTEST EYE IS AT PRESENT INSENSIBLE TO IT
O YE WAGS ALL OF YOU YE BUFFOONS
AND YE HAVE HEARKENED TOO MUCH UNTO THEIR CRYING
AND IF THOU WERT RIGHT--IS IT PROPER TO SAY THAT IN SUCH WISE TO MY FACE
BUT REASONS MAKE THE POPULACE DISTRUSTFUL
O PEACE IN UNCERTAINTY
YE ARE ONLY BRIDGES
TO BE PRICKLY TOWARDS WHAT IS SMALL SEEMETH TO ME WISDOM FOR HEDGEHOGS
AND WHEN OUR AUTHOR SAYS
AND DO NOT FORGET YOUR LEGS
AND DO NOT FORGET YOUR LEGS
SOULS ARE AS MORTAL AS BODIES
ALL CUSTOMS AND BELIEFS SPEAK DIVERS-COLOURED OUT OF YOUR GESTURES
BUT THUS DO I WILL IT
WITH AMAZEMENT DID HIS EAGLE AND SERPENT GAZE UPON HIM
OH THE LONESOMENESS OF ALL BESTOWERS
INNOCENT IS EVERYTHING PETTY OF ITS PETTINESS ESPECIALLY DID I FIND THOSE WHO CALL THEMSELVES THE GOOD THE MOST POISONOUS FLIES
TO BE SILENT IS WORSE
THIS SIGN I GIVE UNTO YOU
WHO HATH SUFFICIENT COURAGE FOR IT
HUSH
HUSH
HUSH
HUSH
HUSH
HUSH
HUSH
HUSH
A BUFFOON MAY BE FATEFUL TO IT
A CRAVING FOR LOVE IS WITHIN ME WHICH SPEAKETH ITSELF THE LANGUAGE OF LOVE
AND EVEN SHOULD I WALK ON MINE OWN ERRORS STILL WOULD I BE ABOVE THEM AND THEIR HEADS
THOU WOULDST HAVE WEARIED OF THY LIGHT AND OF THE JOURNEY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR ME MINE EAGLE AND MY SERPENT
AFTER THEE HOWEVER O ZARATHUSTRA DID I FLY AND HIE LONGEST
AND MUCH HEAVINESS SETTLED ON HIS MIND SO THAT HE WALKED SLOWLY AND ALWAYS MORE SLOWLY AND AT LAST STOOD STILL
THEREFORE SHALL YE BE FIGHTERS
AND ALTHOUGH I HEAR WATER SPLASHING HERE LIKE WORDS OF WISDOM--THAT IS TO SAY PLENTEOUSLY AND UNWEARIEDLY I--WANT WINE
THE WAR IS A WAR OF MORAL PRINCIPLES
AND HAVE NOT EVEN WITHDRAWN FROM THE EARTH
VERILY MY WILL TO POWER WALKETH EVEN ON THE FEET OF THY WILL TO TRUTH
BUT HE HATH ALTERED
READY FOR LIGHTNING IN ITS DARK BOSOM AND FOR THE REDEEMING FLASH OF LIGHT CHARGED WITH LIGHTNINGS WHICH SAY YEA
THOU FATEDNESS OF MY SOUL WHICH I CALL FATE
WHATEVER HATH BECOME PERFECT EVERYTHING MATURE--WANTETH TO DIE SO SAYEST THOU
SO ASKETH THE LOAD-BEARING SPIRIT
AND OUT OF WISDOM HAVE YE OFTEN MADE AN ALMSHOUSE AND A HOSPITAL FOR BAD POETS
THUS IS A STAR PROJECTED INTO DESERT SPACE AND INTO THE ICY BREATH OF ALONENESS
HE WHO SEEKETH MAY EASILY GET LOST HIMSELF
THEREFORE DO I LAUGH IN YOUR FACE MY LAUGHTER OF THE HEIGHT
THUS--ENDETH ZARATHUSTRA'S DOWN-GOING WHEN THE ANIMALS HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS THEY WERE SILENT AND WAITED SO THAT ZARATHUSTRA MIGHT SAY SOMETHING TO THEM
COME LET US SLAY THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY
MY SUFFERING AND MY FELLOW SUFFERING,--WHAT MATTER ABOUT THEM
FEARFULLY WAS I TERRIFIED THEREBY
OUR GREAT HAZAR THAT IS TO SAY OUR GREAT REMOTE HUMAN-KINGDOM THE ZARATHUSTRA-KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS HOW REMOTE MAY SUCH REMOTENESS BE
HIM WHO BREAKETH UP THEIR TABLES OF VALUES THE BREAKER THE LAWBREAKER:--HE HOWEVER IS THE CREATOR
ALWAYS MORE UPRIGHTLY LEARNETH IT TO SPEAK THE EGO
WHATEVER IS MUCH THOUGHT ABOUT IS AT LAST THOUGHT SUSPICIOUS
AT THE EARLY HOUR WHEN THE PAIL RATTLETH AT THE WELL AND HORSES NEIGH WARMLY IN GREY LANES IMPATIENTLY DO I THEN WAIT THAT THE CLEAR SKY MAY FINALLY DAWN FOR ME THE SNOW-BEARDED WINTER-SKY THE HOARY ONE THE WHITE-HEAD THE WINTER-SKY THE SILENT WINTER-SKY WHICH OFTEN STIFLETH EVEN ITS SUN
DIVINELY STEADFAST AND BEAUTIFUL IT HATH BIT ME ON THE FINGER
TELL ME
TELL ME
IT WAS LONG O ZARATHUSTRA BEFORE THOU DISCOVEREDST MY TRICK AND LIE
EVERYTHING IN WOMAN IS A RIDDLE AND EVERYTHING IN WOMAN HATH ONE SOLUTION--IT IS CALLED PREGNANCY
AH WHITHER HATH THAT HAPPY HOUR NOW FLED
VERILY NOT THE ROPE-MAKERS WILL I RESEMBLE
ESPECIALLY THOSE HOWEVER WHO HAVE NO PEACE OR REST UNLESS THEY SEE THE WORLD FROM THE BACKSIDE--THE BACKWORLDSMEN
OF WHAT PRAY EVER JEALOUS
AN UNKNOWN PRESENCE IS ABOUT ME AND GAZETH THOUGHTFULLY
11
11
11
VERILY I LIKE THEM NOT THE MERCIFUL ONES WHOSE BLISS IS IN THEIR PITY
OR TAKE REVENGE AND HE HEARKENED UNTO HIS WEAK REASON
I COOK EVERY CHANCE IN MY POT
SLOW IS THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL DEEP FOUNTAINS
NO GREATER POWER DID ZARATHUSTRA FIND ON EARTH THAN THE CREATIONS OF THE LOVING ONES--"GOOD AND BAD ARE THEY CALLED
THERE IS ICE IN THEIR LAUGHTER 6
WHO COULD--RECOGNISE YOU
TATTER THE MAXIMS OF THE WORLD-MALIGNERS 16
HE WHO MAKETH NO SECRET OF HIMSELF SHOCKETH
WHEN THE SWORDS RAN AMONG ONE ANOTHER LIKE RED-SPOTTED SERPENTS THEN DID OUR FATHERS BECOME FOND OF LIFE
I DO NOT BELONG TO THOSE WHO MAY BE ASKED AFTER THEIR WHY
NOW AND AGAIN I AM TROUBLED BY THE THOUGHT
HEAR ME ALSO WITH THINE EYES
IN THE HAPPY ISLES
IN THE HAPPY ISLES
IN THE HAPPY ISLES
AND ALL THOSE ARE MINE EQUALS WHO GIVE UNTO THEMSELVES THEIR WILL AND DIVEST THEMSELVES OF ALL SUBMISSION
WHITHER HATH THEIR DISTRESS NOW GONE SAID HE AND ALREADY DID HE HIMSELF FEEL RELIEVED OF HIS PETTY DISGUST--"WITH ME IT SEEMETH THAT THEY HAVE UNLEARNED THEIR CRIES OF DISTRESS
GIVE ARDENT FINGERS
WHAT THE SENSE FEELETH WHAT THE SPIRIT DISCERNETH HATH NEVER ITS END IN ITSELF
THOU HOWEVER HAST PERHAPS UNDERSTOOD BUT LITTLE OF MY SONG
AND WHY SHOULD ONE NOT SPEAK LIKE CHILDREN
BUT HOW DOTH THAT TAKE PLACE
FOR THEIR INSTINCTS TELL THEM WHAT REAL RULING IS AND THEY DESPISE THE MOCKERY WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO CALL REIGNING WE ARE NOT THE FIRST MEN THEY SAY AND HAVE NEVERTHELESS TO STAND FOR THEM
BUT I AM DISTRUSTFUL OF YOUR DOGGISH LUST
IN THE END I WAS OBLIGED TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE PIAZZA BARBERINI AFTER I HAD EXERTED MYSELF IN VAIN TO FIND AN ANTI-CHRISTIAN QUARTER
WHAT DOTH IT NOW MATTER ABOUT US KINGS THINE OLD SICKNESS SEIZETH THEE SAID HERE THE KING ON THE LEFT THY LOATHING SEIZETH THEE MY POOR BROTHER
THESE HAVE AS YET BEEN THEIR BEST CONTEMPLATION
IT WOULD NOT LOVE AND WOULD YET LIVE BY LOVE
FOR ONLY HE WHO IS MAN ENOUGH WILL--SAVE THE WOMAN IN WOMAN
AND LONESOMENESS
THAT DO I SOLICIT FROM THE HONEY OF YOUR SOUL
BEHOLD THITHER LEADETH THE WAY TO MY CAVE
WITH THE EYE OF THE THIEF IT LOOKETH UPON ALL THAT IS LUSTROUS
GO RATHER TO THE ANIMALS
THERE ARE TWO LESSONS IN THIS DISCOURSE
BEHOLD SAID THE OLD HELMSMAN THERE GOETH ZARATHUSTRA TO HELL ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT THESE SAILORS LANDED ON THE FIRE-ISLE THERE WAS A RUMOUR THAT ZARATHUSTRA HAD DISAPPEARED
WHAT UNCLOUDED SILENCE
NOTHING IS TRUE ALL IS PERMITTED
VERY WELL
THAT MAY PERHAPS BE A GOAT-HERD
WHAT NEXT
WITH THESE WORDS HATH THERE HITHERTO BEEN THE BEST LYING AND DISSEMBLING AND ESPECIALLY BY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BURDENSOME TO EVERY ONE
INNOCENT ARE THEY EVEN IN THEIR WICKEDNESS
TELL ME YE BRETHREN IS NOT THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS BEST PROVED
HATH THE TIME NOT LONG SINCE PASSED FOR ALL SUCH DOUBTS
THE CAT HOWEVER STEALETH ALONG OVER THE GROUND
YE CALL IN A WITNESS WHEN YE WANT TO SPEAK WELL OF YOURSELVES
AND SOONER WILL I BELIEVE IN THE MAN IN THE MOON THAN IN THE WOMAN
ONCE DID PEOPLE SAY GOD WHEN THEY LOOKED OUT UPON DISTANT SEAS
WELL CALLED HE UPWARDS THUS IS IT PLEASING AND PROPER TO ME
WOMEN ARE STILL CATS AND BIRDS
FOR ALREADY SHE COMETH THE GLOWING ONE,--HER LOVE TO THE EARTH COMETH
FREEDOM FROM FEVER IS STILL FAR FROM BEING KNOWLEDGE
VERILY NO CYCLONE OR WHIRLWIND IS ZARATHUSTRA
O MY FRIENDS THEN SAID YE YEA ALSO UNTO ALL WOE
O BLESSED STILLNESS AROUND ME
A RIDDLE IS IT STILL UNTO ME THIS DREAM

LXXI
IN GENERAL THE DOCTRINE OF THE SUPERMAN CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER IDEAS OF THE AUTHOR'S SUCH AS:--THE ORDER OF RANK THE WILL TO POWER AND THE TRANSVALUATION OF ALL VALUES
NIETZSCHE THE SUPPOSED ANARCHIST HERE PLAINLY DISCLAIMS ALL RELATIONSHIP WHATEVER TO ANARCHY FOR HE SHOWS US THAT ONLY BY BEARING THE BURDENS OF THE EXISTING LAW AND SUBMITTING TO IT PATIENTLY AS THE CAMEL SUBMITS TO BEING LADEN DOES THE FREE SPIRIT ACQUIRE THAT ASCENDANCY OVER TRADITION WHICH ENABLES HIM TO MEET AND MASTER THE DRAGON THOU SHALT,"--THE DRAGON WITH THE VALUES OF A THOUSAND YEARS GLITTERING ON ITS SCALES
MANY A SOUL ONE WILL NEVER DISCOVER UNLESS ONE FIRST INVENT IT YEA INTO THE EVIL CRIED THE YOUTH ONCE MORE
AND WHO COULD HAVE AIRED HIS SOUL THERE
AND HE TOOK NO FURTHER NOTICE OF ANYTHING BUT SAT THERE MOTIONLESS WITHOUT REPELLING THE ANIMALS FURTHER
I AM INTERESTED ONLY IN THE RELATIONS OF A PEOPLE TO THE REARING OF THE INDIVIDUAL MAN AND AMONG THE GREEKS THE CONDITIONS WERE UNUSUALLY FAVOURABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL
ON YOUR SURFACE EVEN MINE OWN LIKENESS IS DISTORTED
THE FIRST NOTES RELATING TO THIS PART WERE WRITTEN WHILE HE AND I WERE STAYING TOGETHER IN ZURICH IN SEPTEMBER 1884
CHAPTER XV
THEREFORE MUST I FIRST GO DEEPER DOWN THAN I EVER ASCENDED
IF ONE WERE ASKED WHETHER THROUGHOUT HIS MANY CHANGES THERE WAS YET ONE AIM ONE DIRECTION AND ONE HOPE TO WHICH HE HELD FAST ONE WOULD BE FORCED TO REPLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND DECLARE THAT AIM DIRECTION AND HOPE TO HAVE BEEN THE ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN NOW WHEN NIETZSCHE MET WAGNER HE WAS ACTUALLY CASTING ABOUT FOR AN INCARNATION OF HIS DREAMS FOR THE GERMAN PEOPLE AND WE HAVE ONLY TO REMEMBER HIS YOUTH HE WAS TWENTY-ONE WHEN HE WAS INTRODUCED TO WAGNER HIS LOVE OF WAGNER'S MUSIC AND THE UNDOUBTED POWER OF THE GREAT MUSICIAN'S PERSONALITY IN ORDER TO REALISE HOW VERY UNCRITICAL HIS ATTITUDE MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRST FLOOD OF HIS ENTHUSIASM
TO KILL ME DID THEY STRANGLE YOU YE SINGING BIRDS OF MY HOPES
DID PERHAPS THEIR HEARTS DESPOND BECAUSE LONESOMENESS HAD SWALLOWED ME LIKE A WHALE
THE SUPERMAN SHALL BE THE MEANING OF THE EARTH
UNTO ALL HOWEVER THAT COMETH FROM THE COURT DO THE MENDICANT PEOPLE PRAY AND ALL APPOINTABLE MENDICANT VIRTUES
IF YE WOULD GO UP HIGH THEN USE YOUR OWN LEGS
BUT THAT SOIL WILL ONE DAY BE POOR AND EXHAUSTED AND NO LOFTY TREE WILL ANY LONGER BE ABLE TO GROW THEREON
POWER THEY SEEK FOR AND ABOVE ALL THE LEVER OF POWER MUCH MONEY--THESE IMPOTENT ONES
LET IT NOT BE YOUR HONOUR HENCEFORTH WHENCE YE COME BUT WHITHER YE GO
BUT IT SPARKLETH WITH SWIMMING ENIGMAS AND LAUGHTERS
BUT FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT REFER TO THIS BOOK IT WERE WELL TO POINT OUT THAT NIETZSCHE CALLED THE PRESENT PERIOD--OUR PERIOD--THE NOON OF MAN'S HISTORY
REASON AND UNDERSTANDING
AND SEEK NOTHING FROM YOURSELVES OPPOSED TO PROBABILITY
THE GOLD HOWEVER AND THE LAUGHTER--THESE DOTH HE TAKE OUT OF THE HEART OF THE EARTH
FROM THE DOGS HAST THOU LEARNED THUS TO BARK AND HOWL
AND EVEN OF THOSE THINGS ARE WE DESIROUS WHICH OLD WOMEN TELL ONE ANOTHER IN THE EVENING
THE BEST BELONGETH UNTO MINE AND ME
BUT THAT THROUGH THE VOLCANO ITSELF THE NARROW WAY LEADETH DOWNWARDS WHICH CONDUCTETH TO THIS GATE
THE WIND PLAYETH WITH HEAVY FRAGRANCE WHICH SEEKETH FOR THEE
TO HAVE FIDELITY AND FOR THE SAKE OF FIDELITY TO RISK HONOUR AND BLOOD EVEN IN EVIL AND DANGEROUS COURSES"--TEACHING ITSELF SO ANOTHER PEOPLE MASTERED ITSELF AND THUS MASTERING ITSELF BECAME PREGNANT AND HEAVY WITH GREAT HOPES
AND IN YOUR EYE--FLOATETH THERE NOT A CLOUDLET OF UNFORGOTTEN EARTHLY BLISS
THEY ARE ANTITHETICAL TO ONE ANOTHER THESE ROADS
THE DISCERNING ONE WALKETH AMONGST MEN AS AMONGST ANIMALS MAN HIMSELF IS TO THE DISCERNING ONE
AND INTO THE UNFATHOMABLE DID I THERE SEEM TO SINK
THE BITE OF THE ADDER
THE BITE OF THE ADDER
ERE ZARATHUSTRA HAD BEEN AN HOUR ON HIS WAY IN THE MOUNTAINS AND FORESTS HE SAW ALL AT ONCE A STRANGE PROCESSION
IT ITCHETH AND IRRITATETH AND BREAKETH FORTH--IT SPEAKETH HONOURABLY
NOT IN VAIN DOTH YOUR LIP HANG DOWN:--A SMALL WORLDLY WISH STILL SITTETH THEREON
AND WHO KNOWETH AS THOU KNOWEST THE VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF THE FUTURE
HE HOWEVER WHO MAKETH THE LAME MAN RUN INFLICTETH UPON HIM THE GREATEST INJURY
I WALK AMONGST MEN AS THE FRAGMENTS OF THE FUTURE
YEA I HAVE DRAWN THE CONCLUSION
THIS AT LAST SAID
SILENTLY DOTH IT PROCEED AND UNCHANGED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS
EASY IS IT TO THROW IN A STONE
AN ENTIRE LANDSCAPE REFRESHETH ITSELF AT ONE SUCH TREE
AND VERILY WHEN THOU SAYEST
O MAN THOU HIGHER MAN TAKE HEED
WHAT HATH HAPPENED UNTO ME MINE ANIMALS?--SAID ZARATHUSTRA
WHY DOST THOU NOT GIVE UNTO IT THY FLESH AND THY BONES
ALL MANKIND'S FAULTS AND WEAKNESSES DID THEY PUT BETWIXT THEMSELVES AND ME:--THEY CALL IT FALSE CEILING IN THEIR HOUSES
NOT LONG HOWEVER AFTER ZARATHUSTRA HAD FREED HIMSELF FROM THE MAGICIAN HE AGAIN SAW A PERSON SITTING BESIDE THE PATH WHICH HE FOLLOWED NAMELY A TALL BLACK MAN WITH A HAGGARD PALE COUNTENANCE
THE WILL IS A CREATOR ALL IT WAS IS A FRAGMENT A RIDDLE A FEARFUL CHANCE--UNTIL THE CREATING WILL SAITH THERETO
IT WAS THE SAME FOOL WHOM THE PEOPLE CALLED THE APE OF ZARATHUSTRA FOR HE HAD LEARNED FROM HIM SOMETHING OF THE EXPRESSION AND MODULATION OF LANGUAGE AND PERHAPS LIKED ALSO TO BORROW FROM THE STORE OF HIS WISDOM
BUT WHAT DOTH HUMAN DISTRESS MATTER TO ME
FIE TO LIVE AMONG THE RABBLE
THE MOST NECESSARY SOUL WHICH OUT OF JOY FLINGETH ITSELF INTO CHANCE THE SOUL IN BEING WHICH PLUNGETH INTO BECOMING
NEVER ON EARTH LAUGHED A MAN AS HE LAUGHED
NO LONGER WILLING AND NO LONGER VALUING AND NO LONGER CREATING
THEY FIND NEW WORDS SOON WILL THEIR SPIRITS BREATHE WANTONNESS
THESE SHALL WE SLAUGHTER QUICKLY AND COOK SPICILY WITH SAGE
A CHILD HATH ZARATHUSTRA BECOME
VERILY IT IS A BLESSING AND NOT A BLASPHEMY WHEN I TEACH THAT ABOVE ALL THINGS THERE STANDETH THE HEAVEN OF CHANCE THE HEAVEN OF INNOCENCE THE HEAVEN OF HAZARD THE HEAVEN OF WANTONNESS OF HAZARD"--THAT IS THE OLDEST NOBILITY IN THE WORLD
HONOUR
HERE DO I SIT AND WAIT OLD BROKEN TABLES AROUND ME AND ALSO NEW HALF-WRITTEN TABLES
BUT THUS HAST THOU EVER BEEN
BUT THE LIE HATH BEEN BEYOND MY POWER
IN TRUTH HOWEVER HE WANTETH MORE TO BE GIVEN HIM
THEY KEEP A SHARP EYE ON ONE ANOTHER AND DO NOT TRUST EACH OTHER THE BEST
THOU WAYLAYEST THYSELF IN CAVERNS AND FORESTS
IN THE WORLD EVEN THE BEST THINGS ARE WORTHLESS WITHOUT THOSE WHO REPRESENT THEM
AND THOU THYSELF SHALT DANCE TO MY LAYS AS MY DANCING-BEAR
SCHOPENHAUER APPEALS TO NIETZSCHE'S DEEPEST AND STRONGEST SENTIMENT--HIS SYMPATHY FOR HIGHER MEN
THIS SEEMS TO ME TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT STRUGGLE WHICH MUST HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN NIETZSCHE'S SOUL BEFORE HE FINALLY RESOLVED TO MAKE KNOWN THE MORE ESOTERIC PORTIONS OF HIS TEACHING
IT IS NOT THY LOT TO BE A FLY-FLAP THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
A BOW EAGER FOR ITS ARROW AN ARROW EAGER FOR ITS STAR A STAR READY AND RIPE IN ITS NOONTIDE GLOWING PIERCED BLESSED BY ANNIHILATING SUN-ARROWS A SUN ITSELF AND AN INEXORABLE SUN-WILL READY FOR ANNIHILATION IN VICTORY
THOU HAST READ MY BEST MY WORST RIDDLE MYSELF AND WHAT I HAVE DONE
WHY SO SOFT SO SUBMISSIVE AND YIELDING
A RULING THOUGHT IS IT AND AROUND IT A SUBTLE SOUL
WHATEVER ARE YOU ABOUT YE GROWN-UP CHILDREN HE EXCLAIMED PULLING UP THE PRAYING ONES FROM THE GROUND
DWARF
AND WITHOUT VALUATION THE NUT OF EXISTENCE WOULD BE HOLLOW
HERE ALL BEING WANTETH TO BECOME WORDS HERE ALL BECOMING WANTETH TO LEARN OF ME HOW TO TALK
AND NO ONE KNEW HOW TO CONSOLE HIM
POPULACE-HODGEPODGE
THE NEXT DAY SAT ZARATHUSTRA AGAIN ON THE STONE IN FRONT OF HIS CAVE WHILST HIS ANIMALS ROVED ABOUT IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE TO BRING HOME NEW FOOD,--ALSO NEW HONEY
HERE ARE CAVES AND THICKETS
FOR HIS LONGING CAME OVER HIM AND HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND HIS MOUTH BECAUSE OF THE AGITATION OF HIS HEART
DO NOT LET THE WEAKLY WOMANLY SPIRITS ATTACK US ANEW AT DESSERT
WAS HE NOT FOR GOOD REASONS KILLED AND MADE AWAY WITH
ITS OWN WILL WILLETH NOW THE SPIRIT
THEY STILL SLEEP THESE HIGHER MEN WHILST I AM AWAKE
BUT NOT A FINGER'S-BREADTH WAS IT YET OPEN
LONDON FEBRUARY 1909
PERAMBULATING REFUTATIONS ARE YE OF BELIEF ITSELF AND A DISLOCATION OF ALL THOUGHT
IT IS THE HISTORY OF HIS MOST INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES OF HIS FRIENDSHIPS IDEALS RAPTURES BITTEREST DISAPPOINTMENTS AND SORROWS
AWAY FROM THOSE FABULOUS SONGS DID I LEAD YOU WHEN I TAUGHT YOU
HOW CHARMING IT IS THAT THERE ARE WORDS AND TONES
TO HIM WHO EVER DISPENSETH THE HAND AND HEART BECOME CALLOUS BY VERY DISPENSING
THIS DO I SPEAK UNTO YOU IN PARABLE
BUT ZARATHUSTRA KEPT SILENT FOR TWO DAYS AND WAS COLD AND DEAF WITH SADNESS
HOW HE RAGED AT US THIS WRATH-SNORTER BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD HIM BADLY
AFTERWARD HE BEGAN TO SING WITH A KIND OF ROARING
XIX

RIDDLES WHICH CAN BE GUESSED
SO LET US PART THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
AT MY MOST VULNERABLE POINT DID THEY SHOOT THE ARROW--NAMELY AT YOU WHOSE SKIN IS LIKE DOWN--OR MORE LIKE THE SMILE THAT DIETH AT A GLANCE
AS A MATTER OF FACT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA THOUGH IT IS UNQUESTIONABLY NIETZSCHE'S OPUS MAGNUM IS BY NO MEANS THE FIRST OF NIETZSCHE'S WORKS THAT THE BEGINNER OUGHT TO UNDERTAKE TO READ
OR A DRUNKARD
DEEP IS ITS WOE EIGHT
UNFRUITFUL ARE YE
YEA A DYING FOR MANY HATH HERE BEEN DEVISED WHICH GLORIFIETH ITSELF AS LIFE
DARWIN IN HIS REMARKS RELATIVE TO THE DEGENERATION OF CULTIVATED TYPES OF ANIMALS THROUGH THE ACTION OF PROMISCUOUS BREEDING BRINGS GOBINEAU SUPPORT FROM THE REALM OF BIOLOGY
IF HE HAD NOT BELIEVED IT SO EARNESTLY IF EVERY ARTIST IN FACT HAD NOT BELIEVED SO EARNESTLY IN HIS HAZAR WHETHER OF TEN FIFTEEN A HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND YEARS WE SHOULD HAVE LOST ALL OUR HIGHER MEN
IT WHINETH IT BARKETH IT HOWLETH
ROUND AND RIPE
ALAS TO ALL FREE SPIRITS WHO ARE NOT ON THEIR GUARD AGAINST SUCH MAGICIANS
WITH STRIPES SHALL ONE AGAIN MAKE YOU SPRIGHTLY LIMBS
FRETTED CONCEIT AND SUPPRESSED ENVY--PERHAPS YOUR FATHERS CONCEIT AND ENVY
SEE TO IT THAT THE LIFE CEASETH WHICH IS ONLY SUFFERING
ONE MUST STILL HAVE CHAOS IN ONE TO GIVE BIRTH TO A DANCING STAR
THUS DOTH IT CALL ALL THAT IS SPIRIT-BROKEN AND SORDIDLY-SERVILE--CONSTRAINED BLINKING EYES DEPRESSED HEARTS AND THE FALSE SUBMISSIVE STYLE WHICH KISSETH WITH BROAD COWARDLY LIPS
WHO WOULD GUESS THAT IT HIDETH DROLL MONSTERS
AN EAGLE SWEPT THROUGH THE AIR IN WIDE CIRCLES AND ON IT HUNG A SERPENT NOT LIKE A PREY BUT LIKE A FRIEND
WHAT HAPPENETH
SO LEARN I PRAY YOU YE HIGHER MEN TO PUT YOURSELVES ON YOUR PROPER LEGS
WOE TO THOSE WHO STILL SEEK THEREAFTER
THUS PROCLAIMEST THOU THY WISDOM UNTO ME
AND IT WERE THEREFORE WELL PREVIOUS TO OUR STUDY OF THE MORE ABSTRUSE PARTS OF THIS BOOK IF WE WERE TO TURN TO SOME AUTHORITATIVE BOOK ON NIETZSCHE'S LIFE AND WORKS AND TO READ ALL THAT IS THERE SAID ON THE SUBJECT
FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM A SIGN OF CONVALESCENCE
AND TO BE THUS IN PAIRS ONE IS VERILY LONESOMER THAN WHEN ALONE
IS YOUR SOUL NOT POVERTY AND POLLUTION AND WRETCHED SELF-COMPLACENCY
I SURPASSED MYSELF THE SUFFERING ONE
AS A SHIP THAT PUTTETH INTO THE CALMEST COVE:--IT NOW DRAWETH UP TO THE LAND WEARY OF LONG VOYAGES AND UNCERTAIN SEAS
YE ARE MY PROPER ANIMALS
THEN HOWEVER IT HAPPENED THAT ALL ON A SUDDEN HE BECAME AWARE THAT HE WAS FLOCKED AROUND AND FLUTTERED AROUND AS IF BY INNUMERABLE BIRDS,--THE WHIZZING OF SO MANY WINGS HOWEVER AND THE CROWDING AROUND HIS HEAD WAS SO GREAT THAT HE SHUT HIS EYES
OUT OF SERVICE
OUT OF SERVICE
OUT OF SERVICE
YEA CHANGED HAVE I SEEN THE POETS AND THEIR GLANCE TURNED TOWARDS THEMSELVES
BODY AM I ENTIRELY AND NOTHING MORE
UNTO ALL OF YOU WHATEVER HONOURS YE LIKE TO ASSUME IN YOUR NAMES WHETHER YE CALL YOURSELVES THE FREE SPIRITS OR THE CONSCIENTIOUS OR THE PENITENTS OF THE SPIRIT OR THE UNFETTERED OR THE GREAT LONGERS UNTO ALL OF YOU WHO LIKE ME SUFFER FROM THE GREAT LOATHING TO WHOM THE OLD GOD HATH DIED AND AS YET NO NEW GOD LIETH IN CRADLES AND SWADDLING CLOTHES--UNTO ALL OF YOU IS MINE EVIL SPIRIT AND MAGIC-DEVIL FAVOURABLE
VERILY EVEN THE GREATEST FOUND I--ALL-TOO-HUMAN THE PHRASE THE REARING OF THE SUPERMAN HAS VERY OFTEN BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD
VERILY DISTRUSTFUL AM I OF YOUR INSIDIOUS BEAUTY
XXVII
XXVII
AND ALSO A WITNESS DO I CHOOSE TO LOOK ON--THEE THE ANCHORITE-TREE THEE THE STRONG-ODOURED BROAD-ARCHED TREE THAT I LOVE ON WHAT BRIDGE GOETH THE NOW TO THE HEREAFTER
TWICE ONLY MOVEDST THOU THY RATTLE WITH THY LITTLE HANDS--THEN DID MY FEET SWING WITH DANCE-FURY MY HEELS REARED ALOFT MY TOES THEY HEARKENED,--THEE THEY WOULD KNOW
HIS SPECIES IS INERADICABLE LIKE THAT OF THE GROUND-FLEA
ARE NOT ALL WORDS MADE FOR THE HEAVY
THERE SPRANG A QUESTION PLUMP AND PLAIN OUT OF HIS MOUTH A GOOD DEEP CLEAR QUESTION WHICH MOVED THE HEARTS OF ALL WHO LISTENED TO HIM
SO THAT VERILY I LACK LITTLE OF BEING THE ETERNALLY WANDERING JEW EXCEPT THAT I AM NOT ETERNAL AND NOT A JEW
THAT DECISIVE CHAPTER ENTITLED OLD AND NEW TABLES WAS COMPOSED IN THE VERY DIFFICULT ASCENT FROM THE STATION TO EZA--THAT WONDERFUL MOORISH VILLAGE IN THE ROCKS
WHEN HE HAD GONE ON FOR TWO HOURS PAST FORESTS AND SWAMPS HE HAD HEARD TOO MUCH OF THE HUNGRY HOWLING OF THE WOLVES AND HE HIMSELF BECAME A-HUNGRY
AND THE ETERNAL RETURN ALSO OF THE SMALLEST MAN!--THAT WAS MY DISGUST AT ALL EXISTENCE
NOW TO UNDERSTAND HIS POSITION CORRECTLY WE MUST SHOW HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE TWO GREATEST OF MODERN EVOLUTIONISTS--DARWIN AND SPENCER
ALMS OF DELIGHT WERE ITS REFRESHMENT
VERILY IT CONVULSETH AND OPENETH THE HEART OF THE LONE SEAFARER
INTOXICATING JOY IS IT FOR THE SUFFERER TO LOOK AWAY FROM HIS SUFFERING AND FORGET HIMSELF
HE IS THAT SEA
EAGLES SHALL BRING US LONE ONES FOOD IN THEIR BEAKS
NOT BACKWARD CAN THE WILL WILL
BUT IMMEDIATELY HE GOT UP AGAIN FROM THE GROUND AND HIS COUNTENANCE BECAME STERN
I SLEPT MY SLEEP FOUR
NOT THE NEIGHBOUR NOT THE POOREST NOT THE SORRIEST NOT THE BEST O MY BRETHREN WHAT I CAN LOVE IN MAN IS THAT HE IS AN OVER-GOING AND A DOWN-GOING
OR A HEALED ONE
I BECAME WEARY OF THE POETS OF THE OLD AND OF THE NEW
I--AM THE TRUTH THAT IMMODEST ONE HATH LONG MADE THE PETTY PEOPLE GREATLY PUFFED UP,--HE WHO TAUGHT NO SMALL ERROR WHEN HE TAUGHT
THE GOOD AND JUST THEMSELVES WERE NOT FREE TO UNDERSTAND HIM
I THOUGHTS OUT OF SEASON PARS
THEY WANT TO HEAR NOTHING OF ANY ONE WALKING ABOVE THEIR HEADS
LOOK AT THIS GATEWAY
I LOVE HIM WHO SEEKETH TO CREATE BEYOND HIMSELF AND THUS SUCCUMBETH THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
WHO HOWEVER COULD TAKE THY MELANCHOLY OFF THY SHOULDERS
I HOWEVER AM A BLESSER AND A YEA-SAYER IF THOU BE BUT AROUND ME THOU PURE THOU LUMINOUS HEAVEN
FOR THEE AM I RICH LONESOME A TREASURE-PIT A GOLD CHAMBER
THEY LENGTHEN OUT THEIR CORD AND THEREBY GO EVER BACKWARD
AND EVEN IN WOMAN'S CONSCIOUS LOVE THERE IS STILL ALWAYS SURPRISE AND LIGHTNING AND NIGHT ALONG WITH THE LIGHT
MANY DIE TOO LATE AND SOME DIE TOO EARLY
AH WHITHER DID MY NOBLEST VOW THEN FLEE
THE YOUNG SHEPHERD BITES AND FAR AWAY HE SPITS THE SNAKE'S HEAD WHEREUPON HE RISES NO LONGER SHEPHERD NO LONGER MAN--A TRANSFIGURED BEING A LIGHT-SURROUNDED BEING THAT LAUGHED
YESTERDAY AT THE STILLEST HOUR DID THE GROUND GIVE WAY UNDER ME
IT IS LONG AGO THAT I EXPERIENCED THE REASONS FOR MINE OPINIONS
HOW IS MAN TO BE SURPASSED THE SUPERMAN I HAVE AT HEART
IT SEEKETH TO ALLURE BY MEANS OF YOU THE MANY-TOO-MANY
THUS DO I PRAISE GOD
FOR WHAT THEY DARE TO TOUCH AND BREAK WITH THE IMPUDENCE AND IRREVERENCE OF THE UNAPPRECIATIVE HE SEEMS LIKEWISE TO TOUCH AND BREAK,--BUT WITH OTHER FINGERS--WITH THE FINGERS OF THE LOVING AND UNEMBARRASSED ARTIST WHO IS ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE BEAUTIFUL AND WHO FEELS ABLE TO CREATE IT AND TO ENHANCE IT WITH HIS TOUCH
A GREAT POTENTATE MIGHT ARISE AN ARTFUL PRODIGY WHO WITH APPROVAL AND DISAPPROVAL COULD STRAIN AND CONSTRAIN ALL THE PAST UNTIL IT BECAME FOR HIM A BRIDGE A HARBINGER A HERALD AND A COCK-CROWING
AND WHATEVER MAY STILL OVERTAKE ME AS FATE AND EXPERIENCE--A WANDERING WILL BE THEREIN AND A MOUNTAIN-CLIMBING
AND WHERE THERE IS SACRIFICE AND SERVICE AND LOVE-GLANCES THERE ALSO IS THE WILL TO BE MASTER
AND PAST THYSELF AND THY SEVEN DEVILS LEADETH THY WAY
WAS THAT--LIFE
HOW COULD THERE FAIL TO BE MOST PARASITES UPON IT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SOUL WHICH CAN RUN AND STRAY AND ROVE FURTHEST IN ITSELF
ALL BEINGS HITHERTO HAVE CREATED SOMETHING BEYOND THEMSELVES
LIKE ONE RETURNING FROM LONG FOREIGN SOJOURN DID HE LOOK ON HIS DISCIPLES AND EXAMINED THEIR FEATURES
WHEN YE ARE EXALTED ABOVE PRAISE AND BLAME AND YOUR WILL WOULD COMMAND ALL THINGS AS A LOVING ONE'S WILL
I LOVE HIM WHO SCATTERETH GOLDEN WORDS IN ADVANCE OF HIS DEEDS AND ALWAYS DOETH MORE THAN HE PROMISETH
PRECISELY THIS IS MUCH HERE IT IS THE MOST HERE
WHAT WILT THOU
THY FOOT ITSELF HATH EFFACED THE PATH BEHIND THEE AND OVER IT STANDETH WRITTEN
IT IS WORTH WHILE LIVING ON THE EARTH
HAVE I_--STILL A GOAL
THIS YEA THIS ALONE IS REVENGE ITSELF
OTHERWISE THY STOMACH THE FATHER OF AFFLICTION WILL DISTURB THEE IN THE NIGHT
NOT ONLY ONWARD SHALT THOU PROPAGATE THYSELF BUT UPWARD
BETTER FOR THEE TO SAY
WHAT MUST ONE DAY COME AND MAY NOT PASS BY
TO THE TICKTACK OF SMALL HAPPINESS WOULD THEY FAIN PERSUADE MY FOOT
AND THERE IS ALSO NO LACK OF ROOTS AND FRUITS GOOD ENOUGH EVEN FOR THE FASTIDIOUS AND DAINTY,--NOR OF NUTS AND OTHER RIDDLES FOR CRACKING
THREE METAMORPHOSES OF THE SPIRIT DO I DESIGNATE TO YOU
HIS GLANCE DULLED HIS TONGUE FALTERED AND HIS FEET STAGGERED
BUT IN THE BODY DO THEY ALSO BELIEVE MOST
HE HATED TO SHARE WITH THEM FOUNTAIN FLAME AND FRUIT
NOW ARE OUR MINDS AND HEARTS OPEN AND ENRAPTURED
SPEAK THY WORD AND SUCCUMB AND I ANSWERED
HE CANNOT SEE THE WOOD FOR THE TREES
TO BE SICK AND DISMISS COMFORTERS AND MAKE FRIENDS OF THE DEAF WHO NEVER HEAR THY REQUESTS
FOR SO DOING NONE OF THE STEPS PARDONS ME
AND THUS DO ALMOST ALL THINK THAT THEY PARTICIPATE IN VIRTUE
THOU GOEST STRAIGHT AND CROOKED WAYS
I AM TOO HOT AND SCORCHED WITH MINE OWN THOUGHT
AT ALL KINDS OF SLAVES DOTH IT SPIT THIS BLESSED SELFISHNESS
WHY DO I NOT GIVE IT
THUS GOETH THE BODY THROUGH HISTORY A BECOMER AND FIGHTER
I MYSELF PERTAIN TO THE CAUSES OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
THE GREETING
THE GREETING
THE GREETING
NOT YET HATH HE OVERCOME HIS DEED
WE MEET WITH SEVERAL PUZZLES HERE
WE DESERVE WINE--IT ALONE GIVETH IMMEDIATE VIGOUR AND IMPROVISED HEALTH ON THIS OCCASION WHEN THE SOOTHSAYER WAS LONGING FOR WINE IT HAPPENED THAT THE KING ON THE LEFT THE SILENT ONE ALSO FOUND EXPRESSION FOR ONCE
THOU ART ANGRY FIRE-DOG
THEREIN IS EVERYTHING MIXED WITH EVERYTHING SAINT AND SWINDLER GENTLEMAN AND JEW AND EVERY BEAST OUT OF NOAH'S ARK
AND VERILY IT CAME NOT UNTO ME FROM THE BEYOND
THOU ASKEST WHY
EXCEPT YE BECOME AS LITTLE CHILDREN YE SHALL NOT ENTER INTO THAT KINGDOM OF HEAVEN AND ZARATHUSTRA POINTED ALOFT WITH HIS HANDS BUT WE DO NOT AT ALL WANT TO ENTER INTO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
IN THE RETURN HOME HE DESCRIBES HOW HE ULTIMATELY RETURNS TO LONELINESS IN ORDER TO RECOVER FROM THE EFFECTS OF HIS EXPERIMENT
NOW DO WE DESIRE THE SUPERMAN TO LIVE."--LET THIS BE OUR FINAL WILL AT THE GREAT NOONTIDE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
IT WAS YE YE WISEST ONES WHO PUT SUCH GUESTS IN THIS BOAT AND GAVE THEM POMP AND PROUD NAMES--YE AND YOUR RULING WILL
AND THUS SPEAK YE OF YOURSELVES IN YOUR INTERCOURSE AND BELIE YOUR NEIGHBOUR WITH YOURSELVES
LET THY PITY FOR THY FRIEND BE HID UNDER A HARD SHELL
AND SPRANG UP NO LONGER SHEPHERD NO LONGER MAN--A TRANSFIGURED BEING A LIGHT-SURROUNDED BEING THAT LAUGHED
WITH CROOKED GLANCES--DOST THOU TEACH ME CROOKED COURSES
THE PLIANT PERSUASIVE BODY THE DANCER WHOSE SYMBOL AND EPITOME IS THE SELF-ENJOYING SOUL
THUS DID MY DREAM FIND THE WORLD MY DREAM A BOLD SAILOR HALF-SHIP HALF-HURRICANE SILENT AS THE BUTTERFLY IMPATIENT AS THE FALCON
HERE WE SEE THAT HE HAD ANTICIPATED THE MOST LIKELY FORM THEIR CRITICISM WOULD TAKE SEE ALSO THE LAST TWO VERSES OF PAR
ALPA
ALPA
ALPA
ZARATHUSTRA KNOWETH LITTLE ABOUT WOMAN AND YET HE IS RIGHT ABOUT THEM
ALL TIMES AND PEOPLES GAZE DIVERS-COLOURED OUT OF YOUR VEILS
AS I WENT ON MY WAY ALONE TO-DAY AT THE HOUR WHEN THE SUN DECLINETH THERE MET ME AN OLD WOMAN AND SHE SPAKE THUS UNTO MY SOUL
IS IT THEN TRUE WHAT THEY SAY THAT THOU HAST AGAIN AWAKENED HIM
HEAR IT YE CREATING ONES
HEAR IT YE CREATING ONES
NOW HATH THE WORLD BECOME PERFECT!"--THUS THINKETH EVERY WOMAN WHEN SHE OBEYETH WITH ALL HER LOVE
BEYOND MAN FORSOOTH
AND ONE DAY ZARATHUSTRA MADE A SIGN TO HIS DISCIPLES AND SPAKE THESE WORDS UNTO THEM
AND WHEN HIS FRIENDS WERE ASKED ABOUT IT THEY SAID THAT HE HAD GONE ON BOARD A SHIP BY NIGHT WITHOUT SAYING WHITHER HE WAS GOING
NO DEED CAN BE ANNIHILATED
OR A MIDNIGHT-BELL
THE LONGING OF OVER-FULNESS LOOKETH FORTH FROM THE SMILING HEAVEN OF THINE EYES
BUT MINE OWN CRYING AWOKE ME:--AND I CAME TO MYSELF THUS DID ZARATHUSTRA RELATE HIS DREAM AND THEN WAS SILENT
HAD I EVER HEARD A DOG HOWL THUS
IT WILL YET THANK YOU FOR O'ERTHROWING IT YE SUBVERTERS
XXVIII
XXVIII
MAN IS DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER AND UNTO HIMSELF MOST DIFFICULT OF ALL
THOUGH IT BE HARD FOR THEE
YE ARE NO BRIDGES FOR ME TO THE SUPERMAN THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
IS IT NOT GOOD MANNERS
IT EATETH ME UP
EVER HAST THOU APPROACHED CONFIDENTLY ALL THAT IS TERRIBLE
LX
LX
IT IS THE DEAD-LEAF BUTTERFLY'S GOOD TO TELL A FOE A FALSEHOOD
OF WHAT ACCOUNT TO ME ARE YOUR MANY LITTLE SHORT MISERIES
SINCE THEN I DO NOT NEED PUSHING IN ORDER TO MOVE FROM A SPOT
AND YOUR HEART HATH ALWAYS SAID TO ITSELF
BUT THE MORE DIFFICULT TASK IS TO COMMAND GREAT THINGS
MUCH VERILY DOTH IT SEEM TO ME FOR SUCH A ONE IF HE SHOULD BE THE HUSBAND OF ONE OR OF TWO OR OF THREE WOMEN
EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN HE WRITES IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY--AND SO WILL IT ALWAYS BE--A SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS THOSE WHO ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED TO DESIRE TO READ HIS OWN DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE SOCIETY HE WOULD FAIN ESTABLISH WILL FIND AN EXCELLENT PASSAGE IN APHORISM 57 OF THE ANTICHRIST
AS IN THE SEA HAST THOU LIVED IN SOLITUDE AND IT HATH BORNE THEE UP
PREFERABLY ALSO DO I SHROUD MY HEAD AND FLEE BEFORE BEING RECOGNISED
SO TEACHETH ZARATHUSTRA
WHAT DOST THOU HERE BETWEEN THE TOWERS
SUFFERING WAS IT AND IMPOTENCE--THAT CREATED ALL BACKWORLDS
THIS BELIEF IN FAITH IF ONE CAN SO EXPRESS IT WITHOUT SEEMING TAUTOLOGICAL HAS CERTAINLY BEEN RESTORED TO THEM AND IN THE FIRST FLOOD OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM THEY USE IT BY BOWING DOWN AND WORSHIPPING AN ASS
THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA IS PERHAPS AN EXAMPLE OF NIETZSCHE IN HIS MOST OBSCURE VEIN
NO DOG--THY GAME JUST AM I CRUELLEST HUNTSMAN
AND SOME OF THEM HAVE EVEN BECOME NIGHT-WATCHMEN
AND TORTUREST ME FOOL THAT THOU ART DEAD-TORTUREST QUITE MY PRIDE
THAT I HAVE TO BE STRUGGLE AND BECOMING AND PURPOSE AND CROSS-PURPOSE--AH HE WHO DIVINETH MY WILL DIVINETH WELL ALSO ON WHAT CROOKED PATHS IT HATH TO TREAD
ONLY THE BIRDS ARE STILL BEYOND HIM
THUS WILT THOU THYSELF ADVANCE WITH HIS SPIRIT AND VIRTUE AND VERILY YE FAMOUS WISE ONES YE SERVANTS OF THE PEOPLE
LIKE LEAD LAY ITS WORDS UPON HIM--THEREUPON HE ROBBED WHEN HE MURDERED
YE MAKE ONE ANOTHER'S HEARTS FRETFUL YE THAT CRY FOR HELP WHEN YE SIT HERE TOGETHER
XVI
XVI
THEN HOWEVER LAID HE HIS FINGER ON HIS MOUTH THE SECOND TIME AND SAID AGAIN
AWAY THOU WOE BUT EVERYTHING THAT SUFFERETH WANTETH TO LIVE THAT IT MAY BECOME MATURE AND LIVELY AND LONGING LONGING FOR THE FURTHER THE HIGHER THE BRIGHTER
NO EYE DOTH IT CLOSE TO ME IT LEAVETH MY SOUL AWAKE
THE GOD OF A STRONG WARLIKE RACE--THE GOD OF ISRAEL--IS A JEALOUS REVENGEFUL GOD
YE EVER BECOME SMALLER YE SMALL PEOPLE
THEY PICK UP THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGE OUT OF ALL KINDS OF RUBBISH
AS A BOY AND A YOUTH NIETZSCHE HAD SHOWN SUCH A REMARKABLE GIFT FOR MUSIC THAT IT HAD BEEN A QUESTION AT ONE TIME WHETHER HE SHOULD NOT PERHAPS GIVE UP EVERYTHING ELSE IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THIS GIFT BUT HE BECAME A SCHOLAR NOTWITHSTANDING ALTHOUGH HE NEVER ENTIRELY GAVE UP COMPOSING AND PLAYING THE PIANO
IS HE A PROMISER
THERE THEY STAND SAID HE TO HIS HEART
ITS HEAD OFF
ITS HEAD OFF
I THINK ABOUT THAT
NOW DO WE KEEP AWAKE AND LIVE ON--IN SEPULCHRES THUS DID ZARATHUSTRA HEAR A SOOTHSAYER SPEAK
THEY RECOVER IN THEIR OWN WAY THEY LAUGH IN THEIR OWN WAY
BETTER EVEN TO BLOW AMONGST THEM WITH RUSTLING WINDS BLOW AMONGST THOSE LEAVES O ZARATHUSTRA THAT EVERYTHING WITHERED MAY RUN AWAY FROM THEE THE FASTER 2
THE DELIGHT IN PETTY EVILS SPARETH ONE MANY A GREAT EVIL DEED BUT HERE ONE SHOULD NOT WISH TO BE SPARING
AS IF THEY HAD NOT YET ENOUGH OF WISEACRES WHOSE VOICES GRATE ON MINE EAR LIKE SLATE-PENCILS
TO THOSE DO I SAY IT TO THE FACE ALTHOUGH IT SOUND UNPLEASANTLY
MY PAIN
CONCERNING HIM MEN HAVE GREATLY DECEIVED THEMSELVES AND LET THEMSELVES BE DECEIVED
THEY ALL FLEW APART AND IN DISORDER ESPECIALLY WHERE THE BODY WAS ABOUT TO FALL
SELAH
SELAH
SELAH
SELAH
AND ALSO THIS PARABLE GIVE I UNTO YOU
SHOULD ONE LAY HOLD OF THEM THEN DO THEY RAISE A DUST LIKE FLOUR-SACKS AND INVOLUNTARILY
LXX
LXX
THEY UNDERSTAND ME NOT
THEY UNDERSTAND ME NOT
MY HAND BURNETH WITH THE ICINESS
WAS IT NOT THOSE WHO SOUGHT TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES AND WERE ASHAMED UNDER THE CLEAR SKY
WOE TO THIS GREAT CITY!--AND I WOULD THAT I ALREADY SAW THE PILLAR OF FIRE IN WHICH IT WILL BE CONSUMED
ONE MUST BE A SEA TO RECEIVE A POLLUTED STREAM WITHOUT BECOMING IMPURE
WHOEVER HATH GIVEN BIRTH HOWEVER IS UNCLEAN
SUCH A PROCESS CARRIED TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS MUST ULTIMATELY END IN HIS OWN DESTRUCTION AND THUS WE FIND THE POPE DECLARING THAT GOD WAS ONE DAY SUFFOCATED BY HIS ALL-TOO-GREAT PITY
WOULDST THOU GO INTO ISOLATION MY BROTHER
WHERE HOWEVER PRIDE IS WOUNDED THERE THERE GROWETH UP SOMETHING BETTER THAN PRIDE
SO WILLETH MY LOT
WITH TERROR IN HIS EYES DID HE GAZE ON HIS DISCIPLES
HERE HANGETH ITS WEB
13
13
13

DWARF I CONTINUED IT HATH TWO FACES
BUT ONLY A BUFFOON THINKETH
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YE MARVEL AT YOURSELVES
WITH DIVINER FEATURES DOTH IT NOW ARISE SEDUCING BY ITS SUFFERING
AND WHATEVER IT HATH IT HATH STOLEN
HE WHO IS OF MY TYPE CAN STILL GO THERETHROUGH BUT--HE MUST STOOP
O MY SOUL EXUBERANT AND HEAVY DOST THOU NOW STAND FORTH A VINE WITH SWELLING UDDERS AND FULL CLUSTERS OF BROWN GOLDEN GRAPES FILLED AND WEIGHTED BY THY HAPPINESS WAITING FROM SUPERABUNDANCE AND YET ASHAMED OF THY WAITING
SUMMER HAVE I BECOME ENTIRELY AND SUMMER-NOONTIDE
COULD NOT A REJUVENATED GRAECO-ROMAN SYSTEM OF VALUING ONCE IT HAD BEEN REFINED AND MADE MORE PROFOUND BY THE SCHOOLING WHICH TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF CHRISTIANITY HAD PROVIDED EFFECT ANOTHER SUCH REVOLUTION WITHIN A CALCULABLE PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THAT GLORIOUS TYPE OF MANHOOD SHALL FINALLY APPEAR WHICH IS TO BE OUR NEW FAITH AND HOPE AND IN THE CREATION OF WHICH ZARATHUSTRA EXHORTS US TO PARTICIPATE
HIS DISCIPLES HOWEVER PRESENTED HIM AT HIS DEPARTURE WITH A STAFF ON THE GOLDEN HANDLE OF WHICH A SERPENT TWINED ROUND THE SUN
FOR I LOVE ALL PIOUS MEN
IS IT NOT THIS
AFTER A LITTLE WHILE HOWEVER HE WAS AGAIN AT HOME WITH HIS GUESTS LOOKED AT THEM WITH CLEAR SCRUTINISING EYES AND SAID
I LOVE HIM WHOSE SOUL IS LAVISH WHO WANTETH NO THANKS AND DOTH NOT GIVE BACK
AND NOW WILL I RUN QUICKLY AWAY FROM THEE AGAIN
YE SHALL LOVE PEACE AS A MEANS TO NEW WARS--AND THE SHORT PEACE MORE THAN THE LONG
O MAN
O MAN
THE WILDEST AND MOST COURAGEOUS ANIMALS HATH HE ENVIED AND ROBBED OF ALL THEIR VIRTUES
IT IS MY FOOT'S EVER READY SERVANT THE SPEAR WHICH I HURL AT MINE ENEMIES
BUT THOU WOULDST GO THE WAY OF THINE AFFLICTION WHICH IS THE WAY UNTO THYSELF
IT IS THE HOUR OF GREAT CONTEMPT
WHEN I LAY ASLEEP THEN DID A SHEEP EAT AT THE IVY-WREATH ON MY HEAD,--IT ATE AND SAID THEREBY
THEY SEEM TO BE MADE FOR SILK DOLLS
HE HIMSELF FOUND I NO LONGER WHEN I FOUND HIS COT--BUT TWO WOLVES FOUND I THEREIN WHICH HOWLED ON ACCOUNT OF HIS DEATH,--FOR ALL ANIMALS LOVED HIM
BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY COUNSELLED THEE
IN THE DAWN OF DAY NIETZSCHE ACTUALLY CAUTIONS YOUNG WRITERS AGAINST THE DANGER OF ALLOWING THEIR THOUGHTS TO BE MOULDED BY THE WORDS AT THEIR DISPOSAL
EXCEPT WE BE CONVERTED AND BECOME AS KINE WE SHALL IN NO WISE ENTER INTO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
HERE DO I SIT NOW THE DESERT NIGH AND YET I AM SO FAR STILL FROM THE DESERT EVEN IN NAUGHT YET DESERTED
THESE BELONG TO A TYPE WHICH NIETZSCHE DID NOT ALTOGETHER DISLIKE BUT WHICH HE WOULD FAIN HAVE RENDERED MORE SUBTLE AND PLASTIC
AND THOU THYSELF THOU OLD POPE HOW IS IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEE TO ADORE AN ASS IN SUCH A MANNER AS GOD O ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED THE POPE FORGIVE ME BUT IN DIVINE MATTERS I AM MORE ENLIGHTENED EVEN THAN THOU
THUS HAVE YE WOUNDED THE FAITH OF MY VIRTUE
THEN HE CONTINUED TO SPEAK THUS--AND HIS VOICE HAD CHANGED
THOU HAST EYES AND HANDS AND MOUTH WHICH HAVE BEEN PREDESTINED FOR BLESSING FROM ETERNITY
VERILY DO I STILL LIVE
HERE DO ALL THINGS COME CARESSINGLY TO THY TALK AND FLATTER THEE FOR THEY WANT TO RIDE UPON THY BACK
AND WHEN BOTH OF THEM HAD THUS SILENTLY COMPOSED AND STRENGTHENED THEMSELVES THEY GAVE EACH OTHER THE HAND AS A TOKEN THAT THEY WANTED ONCE MORE TO RECOGNISE EACH OTHER
AND THERE HAVE PERISHED FOR ME ALL THE VISIONS AND CONSOLATIONS OF MY YOUTH
YEA YE ARE LAUGHABLE UNTO ME YE PRESENT-DAY MEN
AND A VICTORY SHALL BE THE SEAL OF MY PERFECTION MEANWHILE DO I SAIL ALONG ON UNCERTAIN SEAS
THESE HAVE RHYMED FROM ETERNITY
MY FISHING-HOOK
WEALTH THEY ACQUIRE AND BECOME POORER THEREBY
AND UNCONSCIOUS ENVY IS IN THE SIDELONG LOOK OF YOUR CONTEMPT
THE MAN WHO INSATIABLY CRIES DA CAPO TO HIMSELF AND TO THE WHOLE OF HIS MISE-EN-SCENE MUST BE IN A POSITION TO DESIRE EVERY INCIDENT IN HIS LIFE TO BE REPEATED NOT ONCE BUT AGAIN AND AGAIN ETERNALLY
IT DISTINGUISHETH THEM FROM THE GOATHERDS
CANST THOU GO NIGH UNTO THY FRIEND AND NOT GO OVER TO HIM
FOR IT PREFERRETH LAMB'S FLESH
THITHERWARDS STORMIER THAN THE SEA STORMETH OUR GREAT LONGING 29
HAPPY EVEN IS HE WHO LIVETH NEAR THIS WISE MAN
WHEN ALL THIS WENT ON ZARATHUSTRA SPAKE ONLY A WORD
IT WILL BE FOUND FULLY ELUCIDATED IN THE FIFTH PART OF THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS
AND OFTEN HAVE THEY BEEN GOOD SERVANTS AND WORTHY OF THEIR HIRE
IT APPEALETH ONLY TO THE MOST AWAKENED SOULS
I AM OLD ENOUGH FOR IT
AND WHAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINE WHICH HAS GIVEN RISE TO SO MUCH BITTERNESS AND AVERSION?--MERELY THIS
TELL ME MY BROTHER IS THIS THY WILL TO MARRIAGE
AND IN THAT YE SLAY SEE TO IT THAT YE YOURSELVES JUSTIFY LIFE
THEY COMPLETELY LOSE THEIR BEARINGS AND ACTUALLY FIND THEMSELVES IN THE END WITHOUT A WAY A GOAL OR A HOME
O THAT THERE WERE HEAVENLY PATHS BY WHICH TO STEAL INTO ANOTHER EXISTENCE AND INTO HAPPINESS THEN THEY CONTRIVED FOR THEMSELVES THEIR BY-PATHS AND BLOODY DRAUGHTS
IT COMPARETH MASTERETH CONQUERETH AND DESTROYETH
THUS DO YE PLUME YOURSELVES--ALAS
EAGERLY AND WITH SHOUTS DROVE THEY THEIR FLOCK OVER THEIR FOOT-BRIDGE
AND WHEN ONE RUNNETH WELL THEN ONE ESCAPETH HIM
NAMELY MEN WHO LACK EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT THEY HAVE TOO MUCH OF ONE THING--MEN WHO ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A BIG EYE OR A BIG MOUTH OR A BIG BELLY OR SOMETHING ELSE BIG,--REVERSED CRIPPLES I CALL SUCH MEN
BECAUSE IT IS UNCOMMON AND UNPROFITING AND BEAMING AND SOFT IN LUSTRE
THUS SHALL I WILL IT BUT DID IT EVER SPEAK THUS
WHEN GODS DIE THEY ALWAYS DIE MANY KINDS OF DEATH
HE REPROACHES HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES WITH BEING STERILE AND SHOWS THEM THAT THEIR STERILITY IS THE RESULT OF THEIR NOT BELIEVING IN ANYTHING
LIX
LIX
WHICH HATH ALREADY COUNTED THE SMARTING THROBBINGS OF YOUR FATHERS HEARTS--AH
MY DOCTRINE IS IN DANGER
O MY BRETHREN HAVE YE ALSO UNDERSTOOD THIS WORD
THUS DO I MEAN TO MAKE AMENDS FOR BAD DREAMS
POISONERS ARE THEY WHETHER THEY KNOW IT OR NOT
AND NOW DO YE DEFAME DESIRING ON THAT ACCOUNT
THE FIGS FALL FROM THE TREES THEY ARE GOOD AND SWEET
FORGIVE ME HOWEVER YE DESPAIRING ONES FOR SPEAKING SUCH TRIVIAL WORDS BEFORE YOU UNWORTHY VERILY OF SUCH GUESTS
O THOU STRANGE FELLOW HOW MUCH DOTH THIS VERY EVIDENCE TEACH ME--NAMELY THOU THYSELF
MY FOOT--IS A HORSE-FOOT
LIFE IS HARD TO BEAR
THOU SHAKEST THY HEAD
HE WAS THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY--THROUGH HIM ALL THINGS FALL
THOU ART ONE WHO HAST UNLEARNED TO OBEY
VERILY MANY OF THEM ONCE LIFTED THEIR LEGS LIKE THE DANCER
IT WAS A LONG MANIFOLD PECULIAR CRY AND ZARATHUSTRA PLAINLY DISTINGUISHED THAT IT WAS COMPOSED OF MANY VOICES
BEHOLD HERE DANCETH THE LAST JOYOUS MAN IN VAIN WOULD ANY ONE COME TO THIS HEIGHT WHO SOUGHT HIM HERE
VERILY A HEARTY SERVICE UNTO ALL PREACHERS OF DEATH
AND THERE IS ALSO WISDOM THAT IS SUBMISSIVE AND DOGGISH AND PIOUS AND OBSEQUIOUS
BUT HE MOVED HIS HAND AS IF HE SOUGHT THE HAND OF ZARATHUSTRA IN GRATITUDE
WHAT HAPPENETH TO ME
IT WAS BEAUTY'S HOLY LAUGHING AND THRILLING
I APPEARED ON THE MARKET-PLACE
ENJOY THAT AS THY--HAPPINESS THIS HOWEVER IS MINE OTHER MANLY PRUDENCE
A BRUTE INSIDIOUS PLUNDERING GROVELLING THAT AYE MUST LIE THAT WITTINGLY WILFULLY AYE MUST LIE
O MY FRIENDS
TO ALLURE MANY FROM THE HERD--FOR THAT PURPOSE HAVE I COME
AND TO MANY HATH IT PROVED A CALAMITY THAT HE DIED TOO EARLY
VERILY I MYSELF AM THE SCARED CROW THAT ONCE SAW YOU NAKED AND WITHOUT PAINT
THOU HAST NOURISHED US WITH STRONG FOOD FOR MEN AND POWERFUL PROVERBS
ON YOUR KNEES UP THE STAIR YE SINNERS VERILY RATHER WOULD I SEE A SHAMELESS ONE THAN THE DISTORTED EYES OF THEIR SHAME AND DEVOTION
OH YE ONLY DRINK MILK AND REFRESHMENT FROM THE LIGHT'S UDDERS
MOST OF ALL HOWEVER IS THE FLYING ONE HATED
HE THREW HIS POLE AWAY AND SHOT DOWNWARDS FASTER THAN IT LIKE AN EDDY OF ARMS AND LEGS INTO THE DEPTH
TO BE HAPPY IN GAZING
HERE WE SEEM TO HAVE A PUZZLE
THOU WHO ALL MANKIND VIEWEDST SO GOD AS SHEEP
WHETHER HE YET LIVETH OR AGAIN LIVETH OR IS THOROUGHLY DEAD--WHICH OF US BOTH KNOWETH THAT BEST
AND EVEN THEIR LUSTS ARE SELF-LACERATION
FOR ME TO LEARN TO BELIEVE IN YOUR CONSCIENTIOUSNESS YE WOULD FIRST HAVE TO BREAK YOUR VENERATING WILL
BUT THEY SIT COOL IN THE COOL SHADE
BUT THOU O ZARATHUSTRA WOULDST VIEW THE GROUND OF EVERYTHING AND ITS BACKGROUND
IT RENDETH MY HEART
THE CREATOR WISHED TO LOOK AWAY FROM HIMSELF,--THEREUPON HE CREATED THE WORLD
IT ACTUALLY SEEMS TO USE ONE OF ZARATHUSTRA'S OWN PHRASES AS IF ALL THINGS CAME UNTO ONE AND WOULD FAIN BE SIMILES
LOATHING
LOATHING
THEREFORE DO I WIPE ALSO MY SOUL
THOUGH I BE CALLED BY YOU MEN THE PROFOUND ONE OR THE FAITHFUL ONE THE ETERNAL ONE THE MYSTERIOUS ONE BUT YE MEN ENDOW US ALWAYS WITH YOUR OWN VIRTUES--ALAS YE VIRTUOUS ONES THUS DID SHE LAUGH THE UNBELIEVABLE ONE
EVERYTHING PERISHETH THEREFORE EVERYTHING DESERVETH TO PERISH AND THIS ITSELF IS JUSTICE THE LAW OF TIME--THAT HE MUST DEVOUR HIS CHILDREN THUS DID MADNESS PREACH
IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME THAT THE LIGHTNING NO LONGER DOETH HARM
BUT THERE IS MUCH LYING AMONG SMALL PEOPLE
BECAUSE IT IS OLD HOWEVER AND SMELLETH MUSTILY THEREFORE IS IT THE MORE HONOURED
IT IS NOT TO NO PURPOSE
UPWARD GOETH OUR COURSE FROM GENERA ON TO SUPER-GENERA
GOOD MANNERS
THOSE DO I LIKE TO RUN UP AGAINST
ALL THAT PROCEEDS FROM POWER IS GOOD ALL THAT SPRINGS FROM WEAKNESS IS BAD THIS TYPE MUST NOT BE REGARDED AS A FANCIFUL FIGURE
FOR TEN YEARS HAST THOU CLIMBED HITHER UNTO MY CAVE
THAT NO ONE HURT THEM
WITH THE OLD DEITIES HATH IT LONG SINCE COME TO AN END:--AND VERILY A GOOD JOYFUL DEITY-END HAD THEY
IT IS HIS LOVE FOR MAN AND LATELY DID I HEAR HIM SAY THESE WORDS
IT IS HIS LOVE FOR MAN AND LATELY DID I HEAR HIM SAY THESE WORDS
BUT WHAT GOOD DID IT DO
WHAT GOOD IS MY PITY
AND THY LAST GREATNESS MY WILL SPARE IT FOR THY LAST--THAT THOU MAYEST BE INEXORABLE IN THY VICTORY
ASK MY FOOT IF THEIR LAUDING AND LURING STRAINS PLEASE IT
16 17 18 19 20
IN HIM CAN YOUR GREAT CONTEMPT BE SUBMERGED
AND ON ALL THAT IS CAPABLE OF SUFFERING IT TAKETH REVENGE BECAUSE IT CANNOT GO BACKWARD
HERE ZARATHUSTRA SINGS ABOUT THE IDEALS AND FRIENDSHIPS OF HIS YOUTH
AND SO WILL I SHOUT IT OUT UNTO ALL THE WINDS
WHO OUGHT TO BELIEVE ANY LONGER IN THEE IN THIS FREE AGE WHEN THOU BELIEVEST IN SUCH DIVINE DONKEYISM
THOU CHANGE OF EVERY NEED MY NEEDFULNESS
THUS WILT THOU LEARN ALSO FROM ME
THUS DO THEY WAIT AND CLENCH THEIR TEETH
HERE HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA COULD NO LONGER RESTRAIN HIMSELF
THEY HEAR ONLY THE WHISTLING OF MY WINTER-STORMS
ALL GREAT LOVE DOTH NOT SEEK LOVE:--IT SEEKETH MORE
TO A DOLT HOWEVER I SHALL HARDLY ANSWER THOU ART MISTAKEN SAID ZARATHUSTRA SYMPATHETICALLY AND HELD HIM FAST
II
II
TO REMOTER WORLDS SHALL IT BE A LIGHT AND ALSO TO REMOTEST NIGHTS
PUNISHMENT MUST THERE BE AND JUSTICE"--SO THINKETH IT
AS YET HATH MY WORD NOT REMOVED MOUNTAINS AND WHAT I HAVE SPOKEN HATH NOT REACHED MAN
BUT THEY HAVE A TASTE FOR ALL REPRESENTERS AND ACTORS OF GREAT THINGS
THOU HAST MOUNTED HOWEVER ON HORSEBACK
VERILY I ADVISE YOU
ARID HAVE WE ALL BECOME
BY WHAT CONSTRAINT DOTH THE HIGH STOOP TO THE LOW
THERE THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THE LUSTFUL
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF THE TOWN TO WHICH HIS HEART WAS ATTACHED THE NAME OF WHICH IS THE PIED COW THERE FOLLOWED HIM MANY PEOPLE WHO CALLED THEMSELVES HIS DISCIPLES AND KEPT HIM COMPANY
BUT THEN DID YE ENEMIES STEAL MY NIGHTS AND SOLD THEM TO SLEEPLESS TORTURE
WHO HATH TAUGHT IT ALSO TO WILL BACKWARDS
ALL IS UNHOLY TO IT THAT IS NOT SIMPLE
THREE THINGS HITHERTO BEST-CURSED AND MOST CALUMNIATED ON EARTH ARE BROUGHT FORWARD TO BE WEIGHED
OFTEN IS IT READY TO TAKE AWAY MY BREATH
CALM AS THE LIGHT REMAINEST THOU AND NOW WALKEST THROUGH DENYING STORMS
YEA AN ATTEMPT HATH MAN BEEN
WHOEVER AT PRESENT DRIP LIKE BULGY BOTTLES OUT OF ALL-TOO-SMALL NECKS:--OF SUCH BOTTLES AT PRESENT ONE WILLINGLY BREAKETH THE NECKS
THERE IS CONCEALED POPULACE ALSO IN YOU
THREE HEAVY ANSWERS CARRIETH THE OTHER SCALE
THEN DID I HEAR A DOG HOWL THUS
BLOOD TAINTETH THE PUREST TEACHING AND TURNETH IT INTO DELUSION AND HATRED OF HEART
THESE ARE THE WORST MONSTERS FOR MORTALS--LONG SLUMBERETH AND WAITETH THE FATE THAT IS IN THEM
AT LAST HE SPAKE THUS
IN MORALITY NIETZSCHE STARTS OUT BY ADOPTING THE POSITION OF THE RELATIVIST
AND WHEN THE SOUND ALSO WANT SONGS THEN WANT THEY OTHER SONGS THAN THE CONVALESCENT O YE WAGS AND BARREL-ORGANS DO BE SILENT ANSWERED ZARATHUSTRA AND SMILED AT HIS ANIMALS
WITH REVENGE THY POISON MAKETH THE SOUL GIDDY
THEREFORE DID THEY TAKE A DISLIKE TO ME
THE GOD TO REND WITHIN MANKIND AS THE SHEEP IN MANKIND AND IN RENDING LAUGHING THAT THAT IS THINE OWN BLESSEDNESS
SUFFERING WOULD IT NOW BE TO ME AND HUMILIATION
DISDAINFULLY DOTH THE BUFFALO GLANCE THEREAT NIGH TO THE SAND WITH ITS SOUL NIGHER STILL TO THE THICKET NIGHEST HOWEVER TO THE SWAMP
A PARASITE
WE ARE NOT THE FIRST MEN--AND HAVE NEVERTHELESS TO STAND FOR THEM
THE OLD MAGICIAN HOWEVER LOOKED ABOUT HIM ENJOYING HIS TRIUMPH AND ON THAT ACCOUNT PUT UP WITH THE ANNOYANCE WHICH THE CONSCIENTIOUS ONE CAUSED HIM
FOR BOOTY LUSTING MOTLEY MASKED SELF-HIDDEN SHROUDED HIMSELF HIS BOOTY HE--OF TRUTH THE WOOER
FOR THE SAKE OF HIS CHILDREN MUST ZARATHUSTRA PERFECT HIMSELF
OF ALL GOOD THINGS THE ORIGIN IS A THOUSANDFOLD,--ALL GOOD ROGUISH THINGS SPRING INTO EXISTENCE FOR JOY
BREAK UP FOR ME O MY BRETHREN BREAK UP ALSO THAT NEW TABLE
THAT I CALL THEIR HOBBLING.--THEREBY THEY BECOME A HINDRANCE TO ALL WHO ARE IN HASTE
AND UNTO ALL THE FUTURE--FOR THIS PRESENT-DAY THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
BUT WHILE HE GRASPED ABOUT WITH HIS HANDS AROUND HIM ABOVE HIM AND BELOW HIM AND REPELLED THE TENDER BIRDS BEHOLD THERE THEN HAPPENED TO HIM SOMETHING STILL STRANGER
FIRE WOULD THEY THINK THEY DEVOURED AND BURN THEIR MOUTHS
VOLUPTUOUSNESS PASSION FOR POWER AND SELFISHNESS
HOW MY SUMMER HEART LONGETH FOR THY COOLNESS
AT THE SEA WOULD SHE SUCK AND DRINK ITS DEPTHS TO HER HEIGHT
ALL THINGS ARE ENLINKED ENLACED AND ENAMOURED WANTED YE EVER ONCE TO COME TWICE
WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO FIND THE HIGHER MAN THE MAN THAT IS HIGHER THAN WE ALTHOUGH WE ARE KINGS
BUT IT IS NOT THE HEART THAT INSPIRETH THEM--BUT VENGEANCE
SPIRIT IS LIFE WHICH ITSELF CUTTETH INTO LIFE
FOR MEN ARE NOT EQUAL
WHEN NIGHT COMETH THEN TAKE I GOOD CARE NOT TO SUMMON SLEEP
THEN HEARD HE A LONG LONG CRY WHICH THE ABYSSES THREW TO ONE ANOTHER AND PASSED ON
THE MEANING IS HIDDEN IN IT AND ENCAGED AND DOTH NOT YET FLY ABOVE IT ON FREE PINIONS
WHY HATH THE PREYING LION STILL TO BECOME A CHILD
BUT I ASK THEE
NOT AS THE LAW OF A GOD DO I DESIRE IT NOT AS A HUMAN LAW OR A HUMAN NEED DO I DESIRE IT
EVEN THE WISEST AMONG YOU IS ONLY A DISHARMONY AND HYBRID OF PLANT AND PHANTOM
SHALL HIS FAITH BE TAKEN FROM THE CREATING ONE AND FROM THE EAGLE HIS FLIGHTS INTO EAGLE-HEIGHTS
TO MY VERY THROAT THROBBETH MY HEART WHEN I HEAR THEE BURROWING
ONCE THEY THOUGHT OF BECOMING HEROES
YE HAVE ARRANGED TOO HASTILY
NEITHER FOR THE SECOND THE FIRST NOR THE THIRD PART HAVE I REQUIRED A DAY LONGER HE OFTEN USED TO SPEAK OF THE ECSTATIC MOOD IN WHICH HE WROTE ZARATHUSTRA
THE NEW IDOL
THE NEW IDOL
WE MUST HEAR HIM
TO BE BRAVE IS GOOD
TO BE BRAVE IS GOOD
TO BE BRAVE IS GOOD
9

BUT ATTEND ALSO TO THIS WORD
I HATE THE READING IDLERS
AND INTO THE UNFATHOMABLE HAVE I AGAIN SEEMED TO SINK THUS SANG ZARATHUSTRA
AS SUCH A SHIP HUGGETH THE SHORE TUGGETH THE SHORE:--THEN IT SUFFICETH FOR A SPIDER TO SPIN ITS THREAD FROM THE SHIP TO THE LAND
TO UPSET--THAT MEANETH WITH HIM TO PROVE
FOR THAT THEY NEVER FORGIVE THEE
ALL THESE HIGHER MEN THE TWO KINGS THE POPE OUT OF SERVICE THE EVIL MAGICIAN THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR THE WANDERER AND SHADOW THE OLD SOOTHSAYER THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE AND THE UGLIEST MAN--THEY ALL LAY ON THEIR KNEES LIKE CHILDREN AND CREDULOUS OLD WOMEN AND WORSHIPPED THE ASS
MERE FOOL
MERE FOOL
AH WHITHER DID MY TENDER LONGING THEN FLEE
YE LOVE YOUR VIRTUE AS A MOTHER LOVETH HER CHILD
NOW ONLY TRAVAILETH THE MOUNTAIN OF THE HUMAN FUTURE
THE HIGHER MEN HOWEVER WHEN THEY HEARD THE LION ROARING CRIED ALL ALOUD AS WITH ONE VOICE FLED BACK AND VANISHED IN AN INSTANT
WE SHALL FIND THAT HIS STRONGEST TEMPTATION TO DESCEND TO THE FEELING OF PITY FOR HIS CONTEMPORARIES IS THE CRY FOR HELP WHICH HE HEARS FROM THE LIPS OF THE HIGHER MEN EXPOSED TO THE DREADFUL DANGER OF THEIR MODERN ENVIRONMENT
COULD THEY DO OTHERWISE THEN WOULD THEY ALSO WILL OTHERWISE
AND THAT IS THE FIRST THING WHICH I OFFER YOU
IF THINGS HAVE BECOME WHAT THEY ARE THEN HE CONTENDS WE MAY DESCRIBE NO LIMIT TO MAN'S ASPIRATIONS
THOU SEEKEST FOR GREAT MEN THOU STRANGE FOOL
CURIOUSLY DO THEY EXERT THEMSELVES LIKE AN ELEPHANT WHICH ENDEAVOURETH TO STAND UPON ITS HEAD
YEA SOMETHING INVULNERABLE UNBURIABLE IS WITH ME SOMETHING THAT WOULD REND ROCKS ASUNDER
AND WHEN HE INVENTED HIS HELL BEHOLD THAT WAS HIS HEAVEN ON EARTH
THOU LONESOME ONE THOU GOEST THE WAY TO THYSELF
BUT IT IS A SICKLY THING TO THEM AND GLADLY WOULD THEY GET OUT OF THEIR SKIN
WE WANTED TO SEE WHAT BRIGHTENETH DIM EYES
PITY THE OBLIGING HAND THE WARM HEART PATIENCE INDUSTRY AND HUMILITY--THESE ARE UNQUESTIONABLY THE QUALITIES WE SHALL HERE FIND FLOODED WITH THE LIGHT OF APPROVAL AND ADMIRATION
AND VERILY HOW MUCH HATH ALREADY SUCCEEDED
FOR MAN IN HIS INNERMOST SOUL IS MERELY EVIL
A SICK ONE DID I RESEMBLE WHOM BAD TORTURE WEARIETH AND A WORSE DREAM REAWAKENETH OUT OF HIS FIRST SLEEP BUT THERE IS SOMETHING IN ME WHICH I CALL COURAGE
IT RULETH AND IS ALSO THE EGO'S RULER
AND LET THAT BE YOUR BEST CREATING GOD IS A CONJECTURE
THERE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ORGANIC BEINGS ON THIS EARTH
YE ARE ASHAMED OF YOUR FLOW AND OTHERS ARE ASHAMED OF THEIR EBB
ALAS UNROLLABLE IS THE STONE IT WAS
TO WHOM CHASTITY IS DIFFICULT IT IS TO BE DISSUADED
NOW DOTH IT PROVOKE THE LOWER CLASSES ALL BENEVOLENCE AND PETTY GIVING
THE EXCEPTION REVERSED ITSELF TO THE RULE IN HIM
HE LAYETH GREAT STRESS ON ONE'S BELIEVING HIM AY
IT IS THINE INNOCENCE NOT TO KNOW WHAT INNOCENCE IS
BUT HE WISHETH THEE TO THE DEVIL ON THAT ACCOUNT
NO WORD IN THEE IS ANY LONGER GENUINE BUT THY MOUTH IS SO
OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN
OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN
OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN
FOR IT KEPT ITSELF COILED ROUND THE EAGLE'S NECK
OF WHICH CONTAINS THIS NOTE
UNSTEADY AND WITHERED AT THE TOP DOTH THEIR LOOK MAKE THE FRUIT-TREE
BUT THE MORE THEY SINK THE MORE ARDENTLY GLOWETH THEIR EYE AND THE LONGING FOR THEIR GOD
THEY ARE A LOATHING UNTO ME ALL THE SEMI-SPIRITUAL ALL THE HAZY HOVERING AND VISIONARY
IN THIS ATTITUDE WERE THEY ALL THREE SILENT TOGETHER AND SNIFFED AND SIPPED THE GOOD AIR WITH ONE ANOTHER
IN SHORT AS THE PROVERB OF ZARATHUSTRA SAITH
THE AUTHOR OF ZARATHUSTRA NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE OF A TRANSVALUATION OF ALL VALUES THROUGH CHRISTIANITY WHEREBY THE WHOLE OF THE DEIFIED MODE OF LIFE AND THOUGHT OF THE GREEKS AS WELL AS STRONG ROMEDOM WAS ALMOST ANNIHILATED OR TRANSVALUED IN A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME
ZARATHUSTRA'S VOICE ALSO RESOUNDED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT HIS ANIMALS CAME TO HIM FRIGHTENED AND OUT OF ALL THE NEIGHBOURING CAVES AND LURKING-PLACES ALL THE CREATURES SLIPPED AWAY--FLYING FLUTTERING CREEPING OR LEAPING ACCORDING TO THEIR VARIETY OF FOOT OR WING
BUT MY BROTHER IF THOU WOULDST BE A STAR THOU MUST SHINE FOR THEM NONE THE LESS ON THAT ACCOUNT
AND WHO IS IT THAT MUST COME SOME DAY
TO THE GOOD WARRIOR SOUNDETH THOU SHALT PLEASANTER THAN I WILL AND ALL THAT IS DEAR UNTO YOU YE SHALL FIRST HAVE IT COMMANDED UNTO YOU
YOUR WORK YOUR WILL IS YOUR NEIGHBOUR
MY BRETHREN IN WAR
A REFRESHMENT IS IT TO OUR EYES AND HEARTS
AND NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE COMMANDER BEARETH THE BURDEN OF ALL OBEYERS AND BECAUSE THIS BURDEN READILY CRUSHETH HIM AN ATTEMPT AND A RISK SEEMED ALL COMMANDING UNTO ME
SHY ASHAMED AWKWARD LIKE THE TIGER WHOSE SPRING HATH FAILED--THUS YE HIGHER MEN HAVE I OFTEN SEEN YOU SLINK ASIDE
AND TO GO OUT OF THE WAY OF ALL WHO SLEEP BADLY AND KEEP AWAKE AT NIGHT
SO WILLETH MY FATE
YE HIGHER MEN IT IS GETTING ON TO MIDNIGHT
SUCH SIMILES OF ELEVATIONS ARE THE NAMES OF THE VIRTUES
ALL ELSE IS FOLLY
BUT I WAS SILENT
SUCH IS THE COURSE OF THINGS
O MY BRETHREN I CONSECRATE YOU AND POINT YOU TO A NEW NOBILITY
ALREADY LIETH AS IT WERE A SHADOW UPON ME
THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY
THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY
THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY
VERILY THOSE SHEPHERDS ALSO WERE STILL OF THE FLOCK
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER AGES AND ANOTHER EVIL AND GOOD
THUS SLOWLY WANDERING THROUGH MANY PEOPLES AND DIVERS CITIES DID ZARATHUSTRA RETURN BY ROUND-ABOUT ROADS TO HIS MOUNTAINS AND HIS CAVE
CHAPTER XXIV
O ZARATHUSTRA HERE IS THE GREAT CITY
THE MOST CAREFUL ASK TO-DAY
NOW SMILE UPON ME AS MOTHERS SMILE
MY LONGING FOR THAT LAUGHTER GNAWETH AT ME
ALL EVIL DO I ACCREDIT TO THEE
THAT IS THE TRUTH
AT THE NOON OF LIFE NIETZSCHE SAID HE ENTERED THE WORLD
I HONOUR THE REFRACTORY FASTIDIOUS TONGUES AND STOMACHS WHICH HAVE LEARNED TO SAY I AND YEA AND NAY TO CHEW AND DIGEST EVERYTHING HOWEVER--THAT IS THE GENUINE SWINE-NATURE
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT IN SCHOPENHAUER'S ETHICS PITY IS ELEVATED TO THE HIGHEST PLACE AMONG THE VIRTUES AND VERY CONSISTENTLY TOO SEEING THAT THE WELTANSCHAUUNG IS A PESSIMISTIC ONE
DANGER AND DIVERSION
THIS OLD SAINT IN THE FOREST HATH NOT YET HEARD OF IT THAT GOD IS DEAD 3
PEACE WITH GOD AND THY NEIGHBOUR
THEREFORE MUST WE BE FRIENDLY TO EACH OTHER
MY VIRILE FOOD TAKETH EFFECT MY STRONG AND SAVOURY SAYINGS
THE MAN WHO DOES NOT LAUGH LIKE THE MAN WHO DOES NOT MAKE FACES IS ALREADY A BUFFOON AT HEART
BUT AT LAST THERE HAPPENED THAT WHICH AWOKE ME
SO LEARN I PRAY YOU MY WISDOM YE HIGHER MEN
AND AGAINST ALL THAT HATH POWER WILL WE RAISE AN OUTCRY YE PREACHERS OF EQUALITY THE TYRANT-FRENZY OF IMPOTENCE CRIETH THUS IN YOU FOR EQUALITY
THEY KNEW NO HIGHER SIGNIFICANCE OF LIFE
THAT IS THE TRUTH FROM THE BASIS OF YOUR SOULS YE VIRTUOUS ONES BUT SURE ENOUGH THERE ARE THOSE TO WHOM VIRTUE MEANETH WRITHING UNDER THE LASH
I LACK THE LION'S VOICE FOR ALL COMMANDING THEN WAS THERE AGAIN SPOKEN UNTO ME AS A WHISPERING
IN REGARD TO HIS FIRST CONCEPTION OF THIS IDEA HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH ECCE HOMO WRITTEN IN THE AUTUMN OF 1888 CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA OF MY WORK--NAMELY THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS--THIS HIGHEST OF ALL POSSIBLE FORMULAE OF A YEA-SAYING PHILOSOPHY FIRST OCCURRED TO ME IN AUGUST 1881
BUT IT IS NAUGHTY LIKE A YOUNG CHILD
WHO HATH REJUVENATED MINE EYE
HAD HE BUT REMAINED IN THE WILDERNESS AND FAR FROM THE GOOD AND JUST
FOR IN LAUGHTER IS ALL EVIL PRESENT BUT IT IS SANCTIFIED AND ABSOLVED BY ITS OWN BLISS AND IF IT BE MY ALPHA AND OMEGA THAT EVERYTHING HEAVY SHALL BECOME LIGHT EVERY BODY A DANCER AND EVERY SPIRIT A BIRD
HU
HU
HU
HU
HU
BETTER STILL THAT YE LET HIM LIE WHERE HE HATH LAIN DOWN THAT SLEEP MAY COME UNTO HIM THE COMFORTER WITH COOLING PATTER-RAIN
FOR THAT IS MY LAST MANLY PRUDENCE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
DID IT PERHAPS SQUAT THERE ALONG WITH ANOTHER NIGHT-MOTH
AND ONLY FOR CREATING SHALL YE LEARN
THINK OVER THIS SAYING MINE EXALTED FRIEND
TO MANY MEN LIFE IS A FAILURE
AND JUST OWN TO IT
BELIEVE IT MY BRETHREN
BUT THAT IS THE SMALLEST MATTER UNTO ME SINCE I AM AMONG MEN
AND THINE OVER-GREAT HONESTY WILL YET LEAD THEE EVEN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL
YEA THIS EGO WITH ITS CONTRADICTION AND PERPLEXITY SPEAKETH MOST UPRIGHTLY OF ITS BEING--THIS CREATING WILLING EVALUING EGO WHICH IS THE MEASURE AND VALUE OF THINGS
UP TO THY HEIGHT TO TOSS MYSELF--THAT IS MY DEPTH
WHERE I WANT TO KNOW HOWEVER THERE WANT I ALSO TO BE HONEST--NAMELY SEVERE RIGOROUS RESTRICTED CRUEL AND INEXORABLE ZARATHUSTRA GREATLY RESPECTING THIS MAN INVITES HIM TOO TO THE CAVE AND THEN VANISHES IN ANSWER TO ANOTHER CRY FOR HELP
WE SHOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS PERFECTLY BEFORE PROCEEDING
WE ARE BOTH OF US GENUINE NE'ER-DO-WELLS AND NE'ER-DO-ILLS
FROM YOU MY DEAREST DEAD ONES COMETH UNTO ME A SWEET SAVOUR HEART-OPENING AND MELTING
TO BLASPHEME THE EARTH IS NOW THE DREADFULEST SIN AND TO RATE THE HEART OF THE UNKNOWABLE HIGHER THAN THE MEANING OF THE EARTH
FROM THIS THERE HUNG YELLOW GRAPES IN ABUNDANCE CONFRONTING THE WANDERER
WHAT HATH BEFALLEN ME
FOR HE ALWAYS BESTOWETH AND DESIRETH NOT TO KEEP FOR HIMSELF
VERILY ALL TOO WELL DO I UNDERSTAND THE DREAM'S PORTENT AND MONITION
THINK OF THYSELF O ZARATHUSTRA
I LOVE HIM WHO LABOURETH AND INVENTETH THAT HE MAY BUILD THE HOUSE FOR THE SUPERMAN AND PREPARE FOR HIM EARTH ANIMAL AND PLANT
NOW FAR TOO CLOSELY
BECOME WHAT THOU ART APPLIED TO ALL OF COURSE BECOMES A VICIOUS MAXIM
A HORROR SEIZED UPON ME
BUT PERHAPS WHERE ZARATHUSTRA IS CONCERNED WE MAY ALSO SAY WITH MASTER ECKHARDT
WHEN THEY GIVE THEMSELVES OUT AS WISE THEN DO THEIR PETTY SAYINGS AND TRUTHS CHILL ME
FROM BEGINNING TO END IT IS A WARNING TO THOSE WHO WOULD THINK TOO LIGHTLY OF THE INSTINCTS AND UNDULY EXALT THE INTELLECT AND ITS DERIVATIVES
I BADE THEM LAUGH AT THEIR GREAT MORALISTS THEIR SAINTS THEIR POETS AND THEIR SAVIOURS
A MAGIC RESIDETH EVEN IN HIS ACADEMIC CHAIR
DO NOT SING
DESPITE ZARATHUSTRA'S RESERVATION IN THIS DISCOURSE THAT WITH WOMEN NOTHING THAT CAN BE SAID IS IMPOSSIBLE AND IN THE FACE OF OTHER OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY NIETZSCHE IS UNIVERSALLY REPORTED TO HAVE MIS SON PIED DANS LE PLAT WHERE THE FEMALE SEX IS CONCERNED
I AWAIT THE WORTHIER ONE
LET YOUR BESTOWING LOVE AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE BE DEVOTED TO BE THE MEANING OF THE EARTH
I HAVE TO BE WITHOUT PRECAUTION
IN IT MAYEST THOU SEEK HIM WHOM THOU WOULDST FAIN FIND
FOR IF YE BE NOT INVALIDS OR DECREPIT CREATURES OF WHOM THE EARTH IS WEARY THEN ARE YE SLY SLOTHS OR DAINTY SNEAKING PLEASURE-CATS
MAN'S FURTHEST PROFOUNDEST STAR-HIGHEST ISSUES HIS PRODIGIOUS POWERS--DO NOT ALL THESE FOAM THROUGH ONE ANOTHER IN YOUR VESSEL
HERE IS MY DOMAIN
TO ASSUME THE RIGHT TO NEW VALUES--THAT IS THE MOST FORMIDABLE ASSUMPTION FOR A LOAD-BEARING AND REVERENT SPIRIT
BUT SENSUALISTS ARE THEY NOW
AND ONLY MY DISGUST PREVENTETH ME FROM CRACKING THEM
AND WHILE THEY LAUGH THEY HATE ME TOO
AND WHERE THE TEACHING IS DIFFERENT THERE--THE BEST IS LACKING
5 6
NOW ABOUT THE TIME THAT ZARATHUSTRA SOJOURNED ON THE HAPPY ISLES IT HAPPENED THAT A SHIP ANCHORED AT THE ISLE ON WHICH STANDETH THE SMOKING MOUNTAIN AND THE CREW WENT ASHORE TO SHOOT RABBITS
WHAT DIDST THOU DO
WHAT DIDST THOU DO
THE GOD WHO BEHELD EVERYTHING AND ALSO MAN
THAT DOTH THINE EMBITTERED ELOQUENCE BETRAY
HERE HAST THOU NOTHING TO SEEK AND EVERYTHING TO LOSE
THERE IS NO OUTSIDE
THEY BUZZ AROUND THEE ALSO WITH THEIR PRAISE
SPEAK NO MORE
DARK IS STILL HIS COUNTENANCE
HE FEEDETH UPON YOUR GLANCES HE EATETH PRAISE OUT OF YOUR HANDS
PAST THE LINGERING DISTRESS OF MY SPRING
FOR THAT OLD GOD LIVETH NO MORE
HIS DOING OBSCURETH THE DOER
MY LOVE SERVED HIM LONG YEARS MY WILL FOLLOWED ALL HIS WILL
WITH EAGLE-TALONS DOTH IT GRASP AT THE NEW LIGHT
BUT I REGRET TO SAY THAT THIS IS NOT REALLY THE CASE
AND WHAT I WILL THEY MAY NOT WILL THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
I HAVE DIVINED THEE WELL
THEN WHEN IT WAS ABOUT MIDNIGHT ZARATHUSTRA WENT HIS WAY OVER THE RIDGE OF THE ISLE THAT HE MIGHT ARRIVE EARLY IN THE MORNING AT THE OTHER COAST
THIS LONG LANE BACKWARDS
THUS LIVE THE STRONG WINDS
LIKE A DEEP WELL IS AN ANCHORITE
I SHOULD ONLY BELIEVE IN A GOD THAT WOULD KNOW HOW TO DANCE
IT HATH BEEN ENOUGH THAT I--HAVE CARRIED THEE ABOUT WITH ME
IF EVER MY WRATH HATH BURST GRAVES SHIFTED LANDMARKS OR ROLLED OLD SHATTERED TABLES INTO PRECIPITOUS DEPTHS
IT MUST NOW BE THY BEST COURAGE THAT THERE IS NO LONGER ANY PATH BEHIND THEE
AND FOR SUCH ASSUREDLY PINE THE HEARTS ALL OF ARDENT DATE-FRUITS
I AM A LAW ONLY FOR MINE OWN HE SAYS EMPHATICALLY I AM NOT A LAW FOR ALL IT IS OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE TO HUMANITY THAT ITS HIGHEST INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ATTAIN TO THEIR FULL DEVELOPMENT
MY BRETHREN WILL YE SUFFOCATE IN THE FUMES OF THEIR MAWS AND APPETITES
THEY ARE PEOPLE OF BAD RACE AND LINEAGE
AND TO ME ALSO WHO APPRECIATE LIFE THE BUTTERFLIES AND SOAP-BUBBLES AND WHATEVER IS LIKE THEM AMONGST US SEEM MOST TO ENJOY HAPPINESS
VERILY A NEW DEEP MURMURING AND THE VOICE OF A NEW FOUNTAIN
ON A THOUSAND BRIDGES AND PIERS SHALL THEY THRONG TO THE FUTURE AND ALWAYS SHALL THERE BE MORE WAR AND INEQUALITY AMONG THEM
FOR THEREBY HAD A LIGHT DAWNED UPON HIM
THIS DESIRE WILL BE FOUND EXPLAINED IN THE DISCOURSE ENTITLED THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY WHICH I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO REFER TO LATER
AM I SPIRITUAL FOR THEE
I LOVE HIM WHO LIVETH IN ORDER TO KNOW AND SEEKETH TO KNOW IN ORDER THAT THE SUPERMAN MAY HEREAFTER LIVE
I LOVE HIM WHO LIVETH IN ORDER TO KNOW AND SEEKETH TO KNOW IN ORDER THAT THE SUPERMAN MAY HEREAFTER LIVE
WHERE THERE IS TALK THERE IS THE WORLD AS A GARDEN UNTO ME
IT HATH GONE BADLY WITH THEE THOU UNFORTUNATE ONE IN THIS LIFE
BUT LIKE THE SNOUT OF THE BOAR SHALL MY WORD GRUB UP THE BASIS OF YOUR SOULS
THEN HAD THE SERPENT CRAWLED INTO HIS THROAT--THERE HAD IT BITTEN ITSELF FAST
AND WE--WE BEAR LOYALLY WHAT IS APPORTIONED UNTO US ON HARD SHOULDERS OVER RUGGED MOUNTAINS
THIS SPOT WAS ALL THE MORE INTERESTING TO ME INASMUCH AS IT WAS SO DEARLY LOVED BY THE EMPEROR FREDERICK III
IT CONTINUETH FOR AN ETERNITY
AND ALL COMPLAINING ACCUSING THUS SPEAKEST THOU TO THYSELF
ITS LAST LORD IT HERE SEEKETH
AND IF HE BE A DANCER HE IS NOT AT ALL A TARANTULA-DANCER THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
SO THAT WE WERE AFRAID OF THEE
A POISON-WORM GNAWETH AT THEIR HEART
I TEACH YOU THE FRIEND AND HIS OVERFLOWING HEART
BEHOLD THE GOOD AND JUST
IT HATH HITHERTO SLAIN FOR ME EVERY DEJECTION
VERILY EVEN THE GREATEST FOUND I--ALL-TOO-HUMAN THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
WHAT WE RECOGNISE IN A MAN WE ALSO IRRITATE IN HIM
I LOVE THE FOREST
THUS SPEAKETH THE RED JUDGE
BUT EVEN YOUR BEST LOVE IS ONLY AN ENRAPTURED SIMILE AND A PAINFUL ARDOUR
NOW WITH REGARD TO THE ACTUAL SERVICE AND ASS-FESTIVAL NO READER WHO HAPPENS TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE RELIGIOUS HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE AGES WILL FAIL TO SEE THE ALLUSION HERE TO THE ASINARIA FESTA WHICH WERE BY NO MEANS UNCOMMON IN FRANCE GERMANY AND ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE DURING THE THIRTEENTH FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES
AND MANY A BIRD FLIETH AWAY
THOU SUFFEREST LITTLE CHILDREN TO COME UNTO THEE AND WHEN THE BAD BOYS DECOY THEE THEN SAYEST THOU SIMPLY YE-A
EVERYWHERE ONE SEETH RESURRECTED ONES
INSTANT
WITH BLESSED NOSTRILS DO I AGAIN BREATHE MOUNTAIN-FREEDOM
MY BROTHER HAST THOU NEVER SEEN A VIRTUE BACKBITE AND STAB ITSELF
THE PROLOGUE
PERHAPS HE HATH DECEIVED YOU
TOO WELL ALSO DO I KNOW WHAT THEY THEMSELVES MOST BELIEVE IN
FOR A SWORD THIRSTETH TO DRINK BLOOD AND SPARKLETH WITH DESIRE WHEN THE KINGS THUS DISCOURSED AND TALKED EAGERLY OF THE HAPPINESS OF THEIR FATHERS THERE CAME UPON ZARATHUSTRA NO LITTLE DESIRE TO MOCK AT THEIR EAGERNESS
THE TRANSCENDENTAL MAXIM THAT LIFE PER SE IS PRECIOUS IS THE RULING MAXIM HERE
NOW THREATEN ME WITH THE FINGER AS MOTHERS THREATEN
AH MAN RETURNETH ETERNALLY
GIVE ME THY HAND
HOW THEN COULD YE BE FIT FOR MY WARFARE HE REBUKES AND SPURNS THEM NO WORD OF LOVE COMES FROM HIS LIPS
10

RATHER WOULD I BE A DAY-LABOURER IN THE NETHER-WORLD AND AMONG THE SHADES OF THE BY-GONE!--FATTER AND FULLER THAN YE ARE FORSOOTH THE NETHER-WORLDLINGS
AND THIS DO I SAY ALSO TO THE O'ERTHROWERS OF STATUES
THY SHAME O ZARATHUSTRA HONOURED ME
IT SAID DISTINCTLY AND WITH MALEVOLENCE Y-E-A TWAS ONCE--METHINKS YEAR ONE OF OUR BLESSED LORD,--DRUNK WITHOUT WINE THE SYBIL THUS DEPLORED:--"HOW ILL THINGS GO
THOU TEACHEST AND TEMPTEST BACK INTO PRISONS THOU OLD MELANCHOLY DEVIL OUT OF THY LAMENT SOUNDETH A LUREMENT
THIS CONDITION IS WHAT I CALL GREAT HEALTHINESS
THE UNFORTUNATE ONE ALSO DID NOT SEEM TO NOTICE THAT SOME ONE WAS BESIDE HIM
IT IS FROM THEIR WANT OF REVERENCE AND LACK OF SHAME IN PRESENCE OF MY GREAT MISERY THE UGLIEST MAN DESPISES HIMSELF
AND THE FOOL TALKED THUS TO ZARATHUSTRA
THUS SPEAK I TO BACKWORLDSMEN
I AM VERILY WEARY OF IT EVER THY SHEEPISH SHEPHERD TO BE
AND FOR HIS SAKE AND FOR THOSE LIKE HIM MUST I PERFECT MYSELF
BETTER DO I NOW MOCK AT MINE ENEMIES AND MORE HEARTILY WHEN WINTER SITTETH IN MY HOUSE
THE GREAT SYMBOLIC HAPPINESS OF A HIGHER HAPPINESS AND HIGHEST HOPE
NIETZSCHE TELLS US HERE IN A POETICAL FORM HOW DEEPLY GRIEVED HE WAS BY THE MANIFOLD MISINTERPRETATIONS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS WHICH WERE BECOMING RIFE CONCERNING HIS PUBLICATIONS
THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THE FOUR PARTS
YE HAVE TOO CRUEL EYES AND YE LOOK WANTONLY TOWARDS THE SUFFERERS
AND I LOOK DOWNWARD BECAUSE I AM EXALTED
LET US WANDER INTO THE NIGHT
HE BIDS HIGHER MEN DEPART FROM THE MARKET-PLACE
AT LENGTH IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR FEAST ZARATHUSTRA BURSTS IN UPON THEM AND REBUKES THEM SOUNDLY
GOD IS A CONJECTURE
IN THAT THOU CAMEST UNTO ME BEAUTIFUL VEILED IN THY BEAUTY IN THAT THOU SPAKEST UNTO ME MUTELY OBVIOUS IN THY WISDOM
THEN WILL I SAY SOMETHING INTO YOUR EARS AS THAT OLD CLOCK-BELL SAITH IT INTO MINE EAR AS MYSTERIOUSLY AS FRIGHTFULLY AND AS CORDIALLY AS THAT MIDNIGHT CLOCK-BELL SPEAKETH IT TO ME WHICH HATH EXPERIENCED MORE THAN ONE MAN
I LOVE HIM WHO LOVETH HIS VIRTUE
HUSH FOR HAPPINESS HOW LITTLE SUFFICETH FOR HAPPINESS THUS SPAKE I ONCE AND THOUGHT MYSELF WISE
CHAPTER XXIII
THERE IS AN OLD HEAVY HEAVY BOOMING-CLOCK
ON THE CONTRARY THEY--LAUGHED THEMSELVES TO DEATH ONCE ON A TIME
RATHER THOU CONVALESCENT PREPARE FOR THYSELF FIRST A LYRE A NEW LYRE
YE HIGHER MEN DO YE NOT FEEL IT
IT FINDETH OUT THE RICH HEARTS WHICH WILLINGLY LAVISH THEMSELVES
YE HAVE DANCED
SUCH A DICTUM IS NOT EASILY AMENDED AGAIN ON EARTH
NO OTHER NAME HAVE I YET LEARNT
AN EXAMPLE
OH HOW WELL DO THEY NOW PLEASE ME THESE HIGHER MEN!"--BUT HE DID NOT SAY IT ALOUD FOR HE RESPECTED THEIR HAPPINESS AND THEIR SILENCE THEN HOWEVER THERE HAPPENED THAT WHICH IN THIS ASTONISHING LONG DAY WAS MOST ASTONISHING
BUT FOOT-BRIDGES AND RAILINGS SPAN THE STREAM AND THEY SEEM TO STAND FIRM
GERMAN PHILOSOPHERS THANKS TO SCHOPENHAUER HAVE EARNED RATHER A BAD NAME FOR THEIR VIEWS ON WOMEN
SO THAT THE WORLD IS DROWNED IN THEIR UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
THEREFORE DO I ASK MY PRIDE TO GO ALWAYS WITH MY WISDOM
THE WORLD IS DEEP
A SUBLIME ONE SAW I TO-DAY A SOLEMN ONE A PENITENT OF THE SPIRIT
FOR YE DISLIKE TO GROPE AT A THREAD WITH COWARDLY HAND
I KNOW THEE WELL
THE TABLES ARE THEREFORE TURNED UPON HIM
DO LIKE UNTO THE WIND WHEN IT RUSHETH FORTH FROM ITS MOUNTAIN-CAVES
THEY HOUND ONE ANOTHER AND KNOW NOT WHITHER
TO EXHIBIT ONE'S FOLLY IN ORDER TO MOCK AT ONE'S WISDOM
IN THAT WAY AND ALSO OTHERWISE
WOULD THAT THERE CAME PREACHERS OF SPEEDY DEATH
THE STATE WHERE ALL LOSE THEMSELVES THE GOOD AND THE BAD
THERE WHERE THE STATE CEASETH--PRAY LOOK THITHER MY BRETHREN
BUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER HE CHANGED AND SAID SADLY
MUTE O'ER THE RAGING SEA HAST THOU RISEN FOR ME TO-DAY
OFTTIMES SITTETH FILTH ON THE THRONE.--AND OFTTIMES ALSO THE THRONE ON FILTH
FOR THE SAKE OF THIS DAY--_I AM FOR THE FIRST TIME CONTENT TO HAVE LIVED MINE ENTIRE LIFE
IMMODEST HOWEVER IS THE NIGHT-WATCHMAN
SO IS YOUR SOIL
AND IF YE WILL NOT AGAIN RUN GAILY THEN SHALL YE--PASS AWAY
HE WAS AMONG THE FIRST THINKERS OF EUROPE TO OVERCOME THE PESSIMISM WHICH GODLESSNESS GENERALLY BRINGS IN ITS WAKE
AT THY LOOK EVEN THE WAVERING BECOME STEADY AND HEAL THEIR HEARTS
BUT THE POETS LIE TOO MUCH WHY DIDST THOU SAY THAT THE POETS LIE TOO MUCH WHY SAID ZARATHUSTRA
AND WITH FIFTY MIRRORS AROUND YOU WHICH FLATTERED YOUR PLAY OF COLOURS AND REPEATED IT
NOW ART THOU MY LAST REFUGE
KISSED AND SUCKED WOULD IT BE BY THE THIRST OF THE SUN
BUT AS REGARDS THE HIGHER MAN
TWIXT ROSY DAWN AND ROSY DAWN THERE CAME UNTO ME A NEW TRUTH
WHAT COULD YE KNOW OF VIRTUE BUT THAT YE MY FRIENDS MIGHT BECOME WEARY OF THE OLD WORDS WHICH YE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE FOOLS AND LIARS
COURAGE HOWEVER IS THE BEST SLAYER COURAGE WHICH ATTACKETH
ALL THE GROUND TRIETH TO GAPE BUT THE DEPTH WILL NOT SWALLOW
CHAPTER LXII
THE WEAK AND ILL-CONSTITUTED SHALL PERISH
THERE IS HERE ALSO MUCH PIETY AND MUCH FAITHFUL SPITTLE-LICKING AND SPITTLE-BACKING BEFORE THE GOD OF HOSTS
THE IRRETRIEVABLE DID YE TAKE FROM ME:--THUS DO I SPEAK UNTO YOU MINE ENEMIES
NOT TO TELL THE MEAN SELFISH INDIVIDUAL WHOSE SELFISHNESS IS A POLLUTION SEE APHORISM 33 TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS THAT HE IS RIGHT NOR TO ASSURE THE WEAK THE SICK AND THE CRIPPLED THAT THE THIRST OF POWER WHICH THEY GRATIFY BY EXPLOITING THE HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER INDIVIDUALS IS JUSTIFIED;--BUT TO SAVE THE CLEAN HEALTHY MAN FROM THE VALUES OF THOSE AROUND HIM WHO LOOK AT EVERYTHING THROUGH THE MUD THAT IS IN THEIR OWN BODIES,--TO GIVE HIM AND HIM ALONE A CLEAN CONSCIENCE IN HIS MANHOOD AND THE DESIRES OF HIS MANHOOD
WALKETH HE NOT AMONGST US AS IF AMONGST ANIMALS BUT IT IS BETTER SAID IN THIS WISE
AND MANY OF YOU SURELY HAVE HAD KNOWLEDGE THEREOF
LET THY GOODNESS BE THY LAST SELF-CONQUEST
AT SUCH TIME WILL THE DOWN-GOER BLESS HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD BE AN OVER-GOER
LXXII
LXXII
TO BE SURE THOU WOULDST CALL IT BY NAME AND CARESS IT
THAT DIDST THOU DIVINE
IS IT NOT WITH THE GOOD AND JUST AS THOSE WHO SAY AND FEEL IN THEIR HEARTS
BUT THEY THINK ME COLD AND A MOCKER WITH TERRIBLE JESTS
THAT THEY DESPISE IS CAUSED BY THEIR ESTEEM
AND ALL COURTIERS BELIEVE THAT UNTO BLESSEDNESS AFTER DEATH PERTAINETH--PERMISSION-TO-SIT NOR EVEN THAT A SPIRIT CALLED HOLY LED YOUR FOREFATHERS INTO PROMISED LANDS WHICH I DO NOT PRAISE
WITH HAPPINESS HATH ALL LIGHT NOW BECOME STILLER
NO SMALL ART IS IT TO SLEEP
O ZARATHUSTRA HE BEGAN WITH SORROWFUL VOICE THOU DOST NOT STAND THERE LIKE ONE WHOSE HAPPINESS MAKETH HIM GIDDY
THEY ARE ABOVE THE AVERAGE MODERN TYPE
I LOVE HIM WHO IS ASHAMED WHEN THE DICE FALL IN HIS FAVOUR AND WHO THEN ASKETH
BE STILL SAID HE WITH MODEST VOICE GOOD SONGS WANT TO RE-ECHO WELL
IS NOT THE MIDNIGHT BRIGHTER
LIKE THE CAMEL KNEELETH HE DOWN AND LETTETH HIMSELF BE WELL LADEN
SO WILLETH MY LOT--BLESSINGS UPON IT
ALL IS VAIN
BUT SENSE AND SPIRIT WOULD FAIN PERSUADE THEE THAT THEY ARE THE END OF ALL THINGS
THEY PERSECUTE ME
FOR THE DWARF SPRANG FROM MY SHOULDER THE PRYING SPRITE
PHYSICIAN HEAL THYSELF
THE GOOD PIOUS POPE THERE HATH TEARS IN HIS EYES AND HATH QUITE EMBARKED AGAIN UPON THE SEA OF MELANCHOLY
THIS REFERS OF COURSE TO THE RECEPTION PIONEERS OF NIETZSCHE'S STAMP MEET WITH AT THE HANDS OF THEIR CONTEMPORARIES
FOR WHY--ME TORTURE THOU MISCHIEF-LOVING UNFAMILIAR GOD HA
THE COMPOSITION OF THE FOURTH PART ALONE WAS BROKEN BY OCCASIONAL INTERRUPTIONS
THE PAIN MAKETH HENS AND POETS CACKLE
I AM NOT THE MOUTH FOR THESE EARS
I AM NOT THE MOUTH FOR THESE EARS
DO NOT EVEN WHISPER
COME COME COME
EVER LIVEST THOU THERE AND ART LIKE THYSELF THOU MOST PATIENT ONE
ALWAYS SHALT THOU BE THE FOREMOST AND PROMINENT ABOVE OTHERS
WORTHY DID THIS MAN SEEM AND RIPE FOR THE MEANING OF THE EARTH
WHAT IS GREAT IN THEE--THAT ITSELF MUST MAKE THEM MORE POISONOUS AND ALWAYS MORE FLY-LIKE
AND UNWILLINGNESS TO HELP MAY BE NOBLER THAN THE VIRTUE THAT RUSHETH TO DO SO
AND WHEN THEY CALL THEMSELVES THE GOOD AND JUST FORGET NOT THAT FOR THEM TO BE PHARISEES NOTHING IS LACKING BUT--POWER
BEHOLD WHAT HATH BEEN RESERVED FOR THEE
WHAT ARE THESE PRANCINGS AND FLIGHTS OF THOUGHT UNTO ME IT SAITH TO ITSELF
FROM DEEPEST DREAM I'VE WOKE AND PLEAD FIVE
I AM A RAILING ALONGSIDE THE TORRENT
I AM A RAILING ALONGSIDE THE TORRENT
THUS WALKETH HE AS SPIRIT OVER THE BRIDGE
AH THE PITIABLE SELF-COMPLACENCY IN THE TWAIN
BUT I SHOULD LIKE YOUR CONJECTURING RESTRICTED TO THE CONCEIVABLE
WHAT IS THE APE TO MAN
MANY LANDS SAW ZARATHUSTRA AND MANY PEOPLES
MANY LANDS SAW ZARATHUSTRA AND MANY PEOPLES
TO BE ABLE TO CRACK A JOKE ABOUT ONE'S DEEPEST FEELINGS IS THE GREATEST TEST OF THEIR VALUE
FAR AWAY DID HE SPIT THE HEAD OF THE SERPENT
THE SAME DID ALSO ZARATHUSTRA
ALL FEELING SUFFERETH IN ME AND IS IN PRISON
TAKE RATHER PART OF THEIR LOAD AND CARRY IT ALONG WITH THEM--THAT WILL BE MOST AGREEABLE UNTO THEM
HE WHO WISHETH ONE DAY TO FLY MUST FIRST LEARN STANDING AND WALKING AND RUNNING AND CLIMBING AND DANCING:--ONE DOTH NOT FLY INTO FLYING
AT PRESENT HOWEVER A CRY OF DISTRESS CALLETH ME HASTILY AWAY FROM YOU
I AM THE LEADING-STRING OF THE EGO AND THE PROMPTER OF ITS NOTIONS THE SELF SAITH UNTO THE EGO
WHAT WANTETH HE HERE?"--AND HIS SKIN COVERED WITH PERSPIRATION
LET THERE THE TRADER RULE WHERE ALL THAT STILL GLITTERETH IS--TRADERS GOLD
IT IS ALL OVER WITH THEIR FREEDOM
AND THEREFORE SHALT THOU LOVE THY VIRTUES,--FOR THOU WILT SUCCUMB BY THEM THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
INNOCENCE AND CREATIVE DESIRE IS ALL SOLAR LOVE
I HOWEVER AM A BESTOWER
OF SUCH BODIES AND SOULS THE SELF-ENJOYMENT CALLETH ITSELF VIRTUE WITH ITS WORDS OF GOOD AND BAD DOTH SUCH SELF-ENJOYMENT SHELTER ITSELF AS WITH SACRED GROVES
VERILY THEIR SPIRIT ITSELF IS THE PEACOCK OF PEACOCKS AND A SEA OF VANITY
MANY A HOUSE IS STILL TO BE BUILT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
AND THE WANDERER'S SHADOW AND THE LONGEST TEDIUM AND THE STILLEST HOUR--HAVE ALL SAID UNTO ME
THE KING ON THE RIGHT HOWEVER SAID
HE CANNOT LIVE LONG WITHOUT COMMITTING SUCH FOLLIES
IF IT BE CALLED SWAMP OR SKY
TO MY CHARITY HAVE YE EVER SENT THE MOST IMPUDENT BEGGARS
AFTER GOOD SONGS ONE SHOULD BE LONG SILENT
THOU DRINKEST COPIOUSLY AT THE SEA
THITHER LEADETH THE WAY TO MY CAVE
SEE NOTE ON THE PROLOGUE PAR
IT IS MYSELF FORSOOTH O ZARATHUSTRA MYSELF THY SHADOW BUT ZARATHUSTRA DID NOT WAIT
THE HIGHER ITS TYPE ALWAYS THE SELDOMER DOTH A THING SUCCEED SEE PAGE 82 OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL THOSE WHO LIKE SOME POLITICAL ECONOMISTS TALK IN A BUSINESS-LIKE WAY ABOUT THE TERRIFIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE AND ENERGY DELIBERATELY OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT THE WASTE MOST TO BE DEPLORED USUALLY OCCURS AMONG HIGHER INDIVIDUALS
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF DEFENDING HIM HERE AGAINST SUCH FOOLISH CRITICS
FOR THIS IS OUR HEIGHT AND OUR HOME
I ENTICE THEE BACK
AND NOW IT CREEPETH ABOUT AND DEFILETH WHERE IT GNAWETH
AS A MATTER OF FACT HOWEVER WHAT HE COMPLAINED OF MOST WAS HIS SPIRITUAL CONDITION--THAT INDESCRIBABLE FORSAKENNESS--TO WHICH HE GIVES SUCH HEARTRENDING EXPRESSION IN ZARATHUSTRA EVEN THE RECEPTION WHICH THE FIRST PART MET WITH AT THE HANDS OF FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WAS EXTREMELY DISHEARTENING
YE EARTH-IDLERS
JUST AS HE WAS BEGINNING TO RECUPERATE HIS HEALTH HOWEVER AN UNKIND DESTINY BROUGHT HIM A NUMBER OF MOST PAINFUL PERSONAL EXPERIENCES
SOONER WOULD I BELIEVE THAT ZARATHUSTRA HATH TAKEN THE DEVIL BUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEARTS THEY WERE ALL FULL OF ANXIETY AND LONGING
BUT TO BE SURE YE WILL HAVE TO WAIT LONG
ONCE THE SOUL LOOKED CONTEMPTUOUSLY ON THE BODY AND THEN THAT CONTEMPT WAS THE SUPREME THING:--THE SOUL WISHED THE BODY MEAGRE GHASTLY AND FAMISHED
YOUR SLAYING YE JUDGES SHALL BE PITY AND NOT REVENGE
READY AND RIPE LIKE THE GLOWING ORE THE LIGHTNING-BEARING CLOUD AND THE SWELLING MILK-UDDER READY FOR MYSELF AND FOR MY MOST HIDDEN WILL
AND WHAT WERE THE TEN RECONCILIATIONS AND THE TEN TRUTHS AND THE TEN LAUGHTERS WITH WHICH MY HEART ENJOYED ITSELF
SEE HOW THESE PEOPLES THEMSELVES NOW DO JUST LIKE THE TRADERS
BUT HOW DID IT TURN OUT WITH ME
IN THE EVENING HOWEVER THERE WILL BE--DANCING WITH ME THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
AND VERILY THAT IS MY ALPHA AND OMEGA OH HOW COULD I NOT BE ARDENT FOR ETERNITY AND FOR THE MARRIAGE-RING OF RINGS--THE RING OF THE RETURN
LXXV
LXXV
WHAT KNOWEST THOU THEREOF
BUT NOW A CRY OF DISTRESS CALLETH ME HASTILY AWAY FROM THEE
HIS PITY KNEW NO MODESTY
DESPITE THE FACT THEREFORE THAT ALL NIETZSCHE'S VIEWS IN THIS RESPECT WERE DICTATED TO HIM BY THE PROFOUNDEST LOVE
COULD HE ONLY SHAKE HIS HEAD THEN WOULD HIS BURDEN ROLL OFF
BUT TO THE FIGHTER EQUALLY HATEFUL AS TO THE VICTOR IS YOUR GRINNING DEATH WHICH STEALETH NIGH LIKE A THIEF,--AND YET COMETH AS MASTER
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD LEFT THE UGLIEST MAN HE WAS CHILLED AND FELT LONESOME
AND WITHOUT DELAY
IT IS THINE OWN COUNTENANCE IN A COARSE AND IMPERFECT MIRROR
BECOME HARD 30
THEN FORGOT SHE THEREBY AS IT SEEM'TH TO ME THE OTHER LEG
YOUR LOVE TO WOMAN AND WOMAN'S LOVE TO MAN--AH WOULD THAT IT WERE SYMPATHY FOR SUFFERING AND VEILED DEITIES
CULTURE THEY CALL IT
WHAT IS THIS MAN
WHAT IS THIS MAN
XVIII
XVIII
STILL FIGHT WE STEP BY STEP WITH THE GIANT CHANCE AND OVER ALL MANKIND HATH HITHERTO RULED NONSENSE THE LACK-OF-SENSE
LXXVII
LXXVII
HER WOE DOTH SHE RUMINATE OVER IN A DREAM THE OLD DEEP MIDNIGHT--AND STILL MORE HER JOY
IT SLAYETH EVEN DEATH ITSELF
TO PURIFY HIMSELF IS STILL NECESSARY FOR THE FREEDMAN OF THE SPIRIT
ON ACCOUNT OF THOSE ABRUPT ONES RETURN INTO THY SECURITY
IT IS THE HIGHER MAN THAT CALLETH FOR THEE ZARATHUSTRA IS ALMOST OVERCOME BY THE SOOTHSAYER'S PLEADING AS HE HAD BEEN ONCE ALREADY IN THE PAST BUT HE RESISTS HIM STEP BY STEP
TO BE SURE I LOVE IN HIM THE SHOULDERS OF THE OX
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL FOLLY SPEAKING
WITHDRAW FROM THE IDOLATRY OF THE SUPERFLUOUS
THOU HAST HUMBLED THYSELF BEFORE US
PERSIANS WERE THE FIRST TO TAKE A BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF HISTORY
LIKE A CRIPPLE BECOME DEAF AND BLIND AND DUMB--THUS HAVE I LIVED LONG
FOR THEY SHALL SOON NOD TO SLEEP THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
THE SCORNER OF ALL UNCERTAIN VIRTUE
TOO LONG PERHAPS HAVE I LIVED IN THE MOUNTAINS
AND THE LAST GLEAM OF THAT CONSCIENCE STILL GLOWETH ON THINE AFFLICTION
OUT OF YOUR WILD CATS MUST TIGERS HAVE EVOLVED AND OUT OF YOUR POISON-TOADS CROCODILES
LAUGHING LIONS MUST COME
MANKIND OUGHT CONSTANTLY TO BE STRIVING TO PRODUCE GREAT MEN--THIS AND NOTHING ELSE IS ITS DUTY BUT THE IDEALS HE MOST REVERED IN THOSE DAYS ARE NO LONGER HELD TO BE THE HIGHEST TYPES OF MEN
TO FEED ON THE ACORNS AND GRASS OF KNOWLEDGE AND FOR THE SAKE OF TRUTH TO SUFFER HUNGER OF SOUL
WITH THEE HAVE I PUSHED INTO ALL THE FORBIDDEN ALL THE WORST AND THE FURTHEST
BUT ALAS
HERE DO I SIT NOW IN THIS THE SMALLEST OASIS LIKE A DATE INDEED BROWN QUITE SWEET GOLD-SUPPURATING FOR ROUNDED MOUTH OF MAIDEN LONGING BUT YET STILL MORE FOR YOUTHFUL MAIDLIKE ICE-COLD AND SNOW-WHITE AND INCISORY FRONT TEETH
HAVE A GOOD DISTRUST TO-DAY YE HIGHER MEN YE ENHEARTENED ONES
THUS WILT THOU SERVE HIM BEST
WHEN WE APPROACH NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY WE MUST BE PREPARED TO BE INDEPENDENT THINKERS
A HANDBREADTH OF BASIS IS ENOUGH FOR ME IF IT BE ACTUALLY BASIS AND GROUND
AM I DIVINE FOR THEE
LIKE THOSE THEY THIRSTED FOR WAR
THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA
THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA
THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA
WOULD THAT YE WERE PERFECT--AT LEAST AS ANIMALS
DO YOUR HEARTS TURN GIDDY
ONE OF THESE DISEASES FOR EXAMPLE IS CALLED MAN AND ANOTHER OF THESE DISEASES IS CALLED THE FIRE-DOG
IS NOT PITY THE CROSS ON WHICH HE IS NAILED WHO LOVETH MAN
PART II
HATH TIME FLOWN AWAY
WHERE DOTH ONE AT PRESENT LEARN BETTER TO WAIT THAN AT COURTS
STRANGE HUMOURS HATH MY HUNGER
ZARATHUSTRA MADE NO ANSWER THERETO BUT WENT ON HIS WAY
YE WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW CHARMINGLY THEY SAT THERE WHEN THEY DID NOT DANCE PROFOUND BUT WITHOUT THOUGHTS LIKE LITTLE SECRETS LIKE BERIBBONED RIDDLES LIKE DESSERT-NUTS MANY-HUED AND FOREIGN FORSOOTH
THE DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE APPEARS FOR THE LAST TIME HERE IN AN ART-FORM
IMMEDIATELY RUNNETH THE LITTLE MAN THITHER AND HIS TONGUE HANGETH OUT OF HIS MOUTH FOR VERY LUSTING
HOW COULD HE REQUITE
IT CARRIETH ME AWAY MY SOUL DANCETH
SO WHEN ZARATHUSTRA THUS ASCENDED THE MOUNTAIN HE THOUGHT ON THE WAY OF HIS MANY SOLITARY WANDERINGS FROM YOUTH ONWARDS AND HOW MANY MOUNTAINS AND RIDGES AND SUMMITS HE HAD ALREADY CLIMBED
HOLY CALL I SUCH A WILL AND SUCH A MARRIAGE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
THUS DO I ASK YOU
IF THERE WAS DIRT IN OUR EARS WELL
THEY ARE ALWAYS THE BEGINNING OF THE END THEY CRUCIFY HIM WHO WRITETH NEW VALUES ON NEW TABLES THEY SACRIFICE UNTO THEMSELVES THE FUTURE--THEY CRUCIFY THE WHOLE HUMAN FUTURE
O MY SOUL I HAVE TAKEN FROM THEE ALL OBEYING AND KNEE-BENDING AND HOMAGE-PAYING
AND MY SOUL ALSO IS A GUSHING FOUNTAIN
AND MY SOUL ALSO IS A GUSHING FOUNTAIN
AND HE WHO IS NOT A BIRD SHOULD NOT CAMP ABOVE ABYSSES
AWAY FROM THE MARKET-PLACE AND FROM FAME HAVE EVER DWELT THE DEVISERS OF NEW VALUES
TAKE CARE NOT TO SPIT AGAINST THE WIND THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
AND HE WHO WOULD KEEP CLEAN AMONGST MEN MUST KNOW HOW TO WASH HIMSELF EVEN WITH DIRTY WATER THIS I VENTURE TO SUGGEST REQUIRES SOME EXPLANATION
HALT SAID THEN ZARATHUSTRA TO HIS HEART HE THERE MUST SURELY BE THE HIGHER MAN FROM HIM CAME THAT DREADFUL CRY OF DISTRESS,--I WILL SEE IF I CAN HELP HIM WHEN HOWEVER HE RAN TO THE SPOT WHERE THE MAN LAY ON THE GROUND HE FOUND A TREMBLING OLD MAN WITH FIXED EYES
THEN COMETH OUT THE WIND
IN MY DOMAIN SHALL NO ONE COME TO GRIEF
AND WHEN THOU SAYEST I HAVE NO LONGER A CONSCIENCE IN COMMON WITH YOU THEN WILL IT BE A PLAINT AND A PAIN
IF THIS HYPOTHETICAL MAN REPRESENT THE ASCENDING LINE OF LIFE--THAT IS TO SAY IF HE PROMISE ALL THAT WHICH IS HIGHEST IN A GRAECO-ROMAN SENSE THEN IT IS LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE CONDEMNED AS WICKED IF INTRODUCED INTO THE SOCIETY OF MEN REPRESENTING THE OPPOSITE AND DESCENDING LINE OF LIFE
RESPECTABLE DO YE THERE STAND AND STIFF AND WITH STRAIGHT BACKS YE FAMOUS WISE ONES!--NO STRONG WIND OR WILL IMPELLETH YOU
FREE FOR DEATH AND FREE IN DEATH
UNSPOKEN AND UNREALISED HATH MY HIGHEST HOPE REMAINED
IT IS THE HIGHER MAN THAT CRIETH FOR THEE THE HIGHER MAN CRIED ZARATHUSTRA HORROR-STRICKEN
I NEED COMPANIONS--LIVING ONES
WHAT IS LOVE
WOULD YE ALSO MAKE ANOTHER LYRE-LAY THEREOF DO NOT TALK FURTHER ANSWERED HIS ANIMALS ONCE MORE
ONLY THE DOER LEARNETH
VERILY THIS ART AND THIS WINTER-ROGUISHNESS HAVE I LEARNT WELL
CAVES WOULD HE FIND INDEED AND BACK-CAVES HIDING-PLACES FOR HIDDEN ONES
BUT DO I YET TOUCH THEIR SOUL
HE HOWEVER IS THE VINTAGER WHO WAITETH WITH THE DIAMOND VINTAGE-KNIFE THY GREAT DELIVERER O MY SOUL THE NAMELESS ONE--FOR WHOM FUTURE SONGS ONLY WILL FIND NAMES
HE IS INDEED DEAD THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
REAL ARE WE WHOLLY AND WITHOUT FAITH AND SUPERSTITION
THAT IS WHY OF ALL ANIMALS IT HATH BEEN HARDEST FOR MAN
IN THINE OWN CAVE WILL I SIT PATIENT AND HEAVY LIKE A BLOCK--AND WAIT FOR THEE SO BE IT SHOUTED BACK ZARATHUSTRA AS HE WENT AWAY
VERILY IT BECKONETH UNTO THE PREACHERS OF DEATH
ARE WE THEN NOT NEAR RELATIVES WHY SO SOFT
LET YOUR HOPE SAY
THEN HE SOUGHT BADLY
THEN HE SOUGHT BADLY
YE LOOK ALOFT WHEN YE LONG FOR EXALTATION AND I LOOK DOWNWARD BECAUSE I AM EXALTED
AND IF THE BELIEF IN THE PRIVILEGE OF THE MANY MAKES REVOLUTIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THEM IT IS CHRISTIANITY LET US NOT DOUBT IT IT IS CHRISTIAN VALUATIONS WHICH TRANSLATE EVERY REVOLUTION MERELY INTO BLOOD AND CRIME SEE ALSO BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL PAGES 120 121 NIETZSCHE THOUGHT IT WAS A BAD SIGN OF THE TIMES THAT EVEN RULERS HAVE LOST THE COURAGE OF THEIR POSITIONS AND THAT A MAN OF FREDERICK THE GREAT'S POWER AND DISTINGUISHED GIFTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY
ONE STILL LOVETH ONE'S NEIGHBOUR AND RUBBETH AGAINST HIM
THE FIRST TEN VERSES HERE ARE REMINISCENT OF WAR AND WARRIORS AND OF THE FLIES IN THE MARKET-PLACE VERSES 11 AND 12 HOWEVER ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT
HE HATH HEART WHO KNOWETH FEAR BUT VANQUISHETH IT
ESPECIALLY THE STRONG LOAD-BEARING MAN IN WHOM REVERENCE RESIDETH
THOU KNOWEST HOWEVER THAT SOME ONE HEARETH US IMMEDIATELY THEREUPON ZARATHUSTRA WHO HAD OPENED EARS AND EYES TO THIS TALK ROSE FROM HIS HIDING-PLACE ADVANCED TOWARDS THE KINGS AND THUS BEGAN
BE ON THY GUARD ALSO AGAINST HOLY SIMPLICITY
LIKE A BOIL IS THE EVIL DEED
WHAT SHOULD I HAVE TO GIVE THEE
AND EVEN IF ZARATHUSTRA'S WORD WERE A HUNDRED TIMES JUSTIFIED THOU WOULDST EVER--DO WRONG WITH MY WORD
SURFACE IS WOMAN'S SOUL A MOBILE STORMY FILM ON SHALLOW WATER
SOLICIT MUCH--THAT BID'TH MY PRIDE
IS IT NOT JUST DIVINITY THAT THERE ARE GODS BUT NO GOD HE THAT HATH AN EAR LET HIM HEAR THUS TALKED ZARATHUSTRA IN THE CITY HE LOVED WHICH IS SURNAMED THE PIED COW FOR FROM HERE HE HAD BUT TWO DAYS TO TRAVEL TO REACH ONCE MORE HIS CAVE AND HIS ANIMALS
WITH THE SWORD OF THINE UTTERANCE SEVEREST THOU THE THICKEST DARKNESS OF OUR HEARTS
NO ONE ELSE HAVE I FOUND TO-DAY POTENT ENOUGH FOR THIS
THOU WOULDST PULL ITS EARS AND AMUSE THYSELF WITH IT
YEA ONCE MORE MUST ZARATHUSTRA RETIRE TO HIS SOLITUDE
THAT MAKETH PLEASANT DREAMS
THE GOOD--THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE BEGINNING OF THE END 27
AND ZARATHUSTRA SPAKE THUS UNTO THE PEOPLE
HE HOWEVER WHO IS OBTRUSIVE WITH HIS EYES AS A DISCERNER HOW CAN HE EVER SEE MORE OF ANYTHING THAN ITS FOREGROUND
ALL IS VAIN BUT TO EAT AND DRINK WELL MY BRETHREN IS VERILY NO VAIN ART
THEREFORE THEY HATE THEE AND WOULD FAIN SUCK THY BLOOD
FOR AS EAGER BEHOLDERS HAVE WE COME
THEN CAME TO ME THE DAY,--AND NOW COMETH IT TO YOU,--AT AN END IS THE MOON'S LOVE AFFAIR
HIS HAIR HOWEVER BECAME WHITE
AND WHAT IT FETCHED AND FORAGED IT LAID ON ZARATHUSTRA'S COUCH
XL
XL
TO THE LION-WILLED HOWEVER THE GREAT CORDIAL AND THE REVERENTLY SAVED WINE OF WINES
THUS DO I CALL YOU YE REAL ONES
BUT THOU PULLEDST ME OUT WITH A GOLDEN ANGLE
THAT IS THEIR TRAVELLING
AND I MYSELF--DO I THEREBY WANT TO BE MAN'S ACCUSER
MUST NOT WHATEVER CAN HAPPEN OF ALL THINGS HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED RESULTED AND GONE BY
BUT IT IS UNAVOIDABLE THAT WE SHOULD LOOK ON THE WORTHIEST AIMS AND HOPES OF THE MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY WITH ILL-CONCEALED AMUSEMENT AND PERHAPS SHOULD NO LONGER LOOK AT THEM
IF EVER I HAVE DRUNK A FULL DRAUGHT OF THE FOAMING SPICE AND CONFECTION-BOWL IN WHICH ALL THINGS ARE WELL MIXED
THOU UNKNOWN ONE
ON HIM DO THEY STILL HOUND THEIR SHARPEST-TOOTHED DOGS
I NEED HANDS OUTSTRETCHED TO TAKE IT
TO SUCH UNSETTLED ONES AS THOU SEEMETH AT LAST EVEN A PRISONER BLESSED
UP THITHER IS THE WAY TO MY CAVE
GO ON HALT-FOOT CRIED HIS FRIGHTFUL VOICE GO ON LAZY-BONES INTERLOPER SALLOW-FACE!--LEST I TICKLE THEE WITH MY HEEL
AND ONCE WHEN HE SAW A ROW OF NEW HOUSES HE MARVELLED AND SAID
WHY WOULDST THOU WADE THROUGH THIS MIRE
THE HOUR-HAND MOVED ON THE TIMEPIECE OF MY LIFE DREW BREATH--NEVER DID I HEAR SUCH STILLNESS AROUND ME SO THAT MY HEART WAS TERRIFIED
BLESSED BE MODERATE POVERTY
AND THERE IS A LIFE AT WHOSE WATERS NONE OF THE RABBLE DRINK WITH ME
AS YET IT HATH NOT MADE ME PASSIONATE
AND THEY THEMSELVES WERE FORMERLY THE BEST WORLD-MALIGNERS AND HERETIC-BURNERS
THERE IS MUCH CHILDISHNESS IN THE OLD BOOKS OF WISDOM
AND OFT HAVE I FOUND IN THE SON THE FATHER'S REVEALED SECRET
THE OLD DEEP DEEP MIDNIGHT
BUT MAN DOTH NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE BUT ALSO BY THE FLESH OF GOOD LAMBS OF WHICH I HAVE TWO
LEARN TO LAUGH AT YOURSELVES AS YE OUGHT TO LAUGH
LEARN TO LAUGH AT YOURSELVES AS YE OUGHT TO LAUGH
ALMOST IN THE CRADLE ARE WE APPORTIONED WITH HEAVY WORDS AND WORTHS
ONE SHOULD HAVE THEM,--BUT ONE SHOULD RATHER SEEK FOR GUILT AND PAIN 6
THREE
IT LONGETH TO FIND EXPRESSION
VERILY NO GREAT SOUL PUT THEM UP AS ITS SIMILE
AND WHEN HE SOUGHT FOR A WELL LO HE LIGHTED UPON A GREEN MEADOW PEACEFULLY SURROUNDED WITH TREES AND BUSHES WHERE MAIDENS WERE DANCING TOGETHER
XV

AND AS THE WORLD UNROLLED ITSELF FOR HIM SO ROLLETH IT TOGETHER AGAIN FOR HIM IN RINGS AS THE GROWTH OF GOOD THROUGH EVIL AS THE GROWTH OF PURPOSE OUT OF CHANCE
AND THEY KNEW NOT HOW TO LOVE THEIR GOD OTHERWISE THAN BY NAILING MEN TO THE CROSS
RESEMBLE AGAIN THE TREE WHICH THOU LOVEST THE BROAD-BRANCHED ONE--SILENTLY AND ATTENTIVELY IT O'ERHANGETH THE SEA
GO NOT TO MEN BUT STAY IN THE FOREST
FOR VERILY MY BRETHREN THE SPIRIT IS A STOMACH
THEREFORE DO THEIR WOMEN MASCULINISE THEMSELVES
WHY STEALEST THOU ALONG SO FURTIVELY IN THE TWILIGHT ZARATHUSTRA
FORTUNATELY THE NATURAL SO-CALLED WICKEDNESS OF HIGHER MEN HAS IN A CERTAIN MEASURE BEEN ABLE TO RESIST THIS LOPPING PROCESS WHICH SUCCESSIVE SLAVE-MORALITIES HAVE PRACTISED
OR SHOW YOU RESTLESS MISWANDERING MISCLIMBING ONES NEW AND EASIER FOOTPATHS NAY
IT WAS THY GOOD FORTUNE TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE DEAD DOG
MY BROTHER IF THOU BE FORTUNATE THEN WILT THOU HAVE ONE VIRTUE AND NO MORE
HERE WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THAT COURAGEOUS AND WAYWARD SPIRIT THAT LITERALLY HAUNTS THE FOOTSTEPS OF EVERY GREAT THINKER AND EVERY GREAT LEADER
THOU THYSELF--VERILY
BUT MY WILLING EVER COMETH TO ME AS MINE EMANCIPATOR AND COMFORTER
O'ERSHADOWED IS STILL THE SENSE OF HIS EYE
EVERY HONEST ONE'S STEP SPEAKETH
WE BITE NO ONE AND GO OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM WHO WOULD BITE
NECESSARY ARE THE ENVY AND THE DISTRUST AND THE BACK-BITING AMONG THE VIRTUES
TELL ME MINE ANIMALS
XXXVI

PERHAPS SHE IS WICKED AND FALSE AND ALTOGETHER A WOMAN
THIS IS THE NEW STILLNESS WHICH I HAVE EXPERIENCED
WHY DO YE DISSEMBLE AND DISGUISE YOURSELVES BEFORE ME
WHERE THERE IS STILL A PEOPLE THERE THE STATE IS NOT UNDERSTOOD BUT HATED AS THE EVIL EYE AND AS SIN AGAINST LAWS AND CUSTOMS
NOT TO THE PEOPLE IS ZARATHUSTRA TO SPEAK BUT TO COMPANIONS
BADLY THEY ALL SMELL TO ME THESE IDOLATERS
IN THE EVENING HOWEVER ROPE-DANCERS WERE MY COMPANIONS AND CORPSES
TO BE ANOINTED AND CONSECRATED WITH TEARS AS A SACRIFICIAL VICTIM,--DID YE KNOW THAT BEFORE
DIDST THOU NOT INVITE ME TO TABLE
TAKE WHAT I AM
AND LET THE PEOPLE AND PEOPLES GO THEIRS!--GLOOMY WAYS VERILY ON WHICH NOT A SINGLE HOPE GLINTETH ANY MORE
I WANT TO TEACH MEN THE SENSE OF THEIR EXISTENCE WHICH IS THE SUPERMAN THE LIGHTNING OUT OF THE DARK CLOUD--MAN
TIME WOULD BE GONE AND ALL THE PERISHABLE WOULD BE BUT A LIE
EVERYTHING AMONG THEM TALKETH EVERYTHING IS BETRAYED
AROUND SOOTHSAYERS AND ASTROLOGERS HATH HITHERTO REVOLVED THE ORBIT OF THIS ILLUSION
I LOVE THE GREAT DESPISERS
THUS RUMINATING PATIENT AS A COW I ASK MYSELF
HOW WAS THIS POSSIBLE
I EMANCIPATED THEM FROM BONDAGE UNDER PURPOSE
THUS SPAKE THE DEVIL UNTO ME ONCE ON A TIME
THUS SPAKE THE DEVIL UNTO ME ONCE ON A TIME
JUST AS PROPHETS CENTURIES AGO OFTEN HAD TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE MASK OF MADNESS IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE HATRED OF THOSE WHO DID NOT AND COULD NOT SEE AS THEY DID
THE MAGICIAN IS OF COURSE AN ARTIST AND NIETZSCHE'S INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF PERHAPS THE GREATEST ARTIST OF HIS AGE RENDERED THE SELECTION OF WAGNER AS THE TYPE IN THIS DISCOURSE ALMOST INEVITABLE
FOR FEAR--IS AN EXCEPTION WITH US
YOUR LASCIVIOUS THOUGHTS YOUR LIES AND SECRETS ARE INDEED IN THE AIR
BUT WHATEVER ART THOU ABOUT CALLED OUT ZARATHUSTRA IN ALARM FOR HE SAW A DEAL OF BLOOD STREAMING OVER THE NAKED ARM,--"WHAT HATH HURT THEE
SO GREAT WAS THEIR EAGERNESS TO TELL HIM ABOUT THE SAILORS THE RABBITS AND THE FLYING MAN
THERE IS NO SORER MISFORTUNE IN ALL HUMAN DESTINY THAN WHEN THE MIGHTY OF THE EARTH ARE NOT ALSO THE FIRST MEN
THERE IS NO SORER MISFORTUNE IN ALL HUMAN DESTINY THAN WHEN THE MIGHTY OF THE EARTH ARE NOT ALSO THE FIRST MEN
AND FOOL THAT I WAS WHEN THEY MISJUDGED ME I INDULGED THEM ON THAT ACCOUNT MORE THAN MYSELF BEING HABITUALLY HARD ON MYSELF AND OFTEN EVEN TAKING REVENGE ON MYSELF FOR THE INDULGENCE
NIETZSCHE AS IS WELL KNOWN WAS AT ONE TIME AN ARDENT FOLLOWER OF SCHOPENHAUER
THERE ARE MANY DIVERS WAYS AND MODES OF SURPASSING
V

YE ARE NOT HOT ENOUGH FOR THAT
THE WEARY-O'-THE-WORLD PUT IT UP AND THE PREACHERS OF DEATH AND THE JAILER
THOU WITCH IF I HAVE HITHERTO SUNG UNTO THEE NOW SHALT THOU--CRY UNTO ME
IT SEEMETH TO ME THAT FOR SUCH FLOWERS AS YOU NEW FESTIVALS ARE REQUIRED
THOU WING FLY
AS A PHILOSOPHER HOWEVER NIETZSCHE DOES NOT STAND OR FALL BY HIS OBJECTIONS TO THE DARWINIAN OR SPENCERIAN COSMOGONY
YET STILL CAN I SAY THEREWITH THE TRUTH--TO DISSEMBLERS
WILT THOU PERHAPS SING O MY SOUL
OTHERWISE WOULD HE ALSO HAVE LOVED US THE LAUGHING ONES

AND THAT I AM FRIENDLY TO THEE AND OFTEN TOO FRIENDLY THAT KNOWEST THOU
AND JUST AS THE OLD SYSTEM OF VALUING WHICH ONLY EXTOLLED THE QUALITIES FAVOURABLE TO THE WEAK THE SUFFERING AND THE OPPRESSED HAS SUCCEEDED IN PRODUCING A WEAK SUFFERING AND MODERN RACE SO THIS NEW AND REVERSED SYSTEM OF VALUING OUGHT TO REAR A HEALTHY STRONG LIVELY AND COURAGEOUS TYPE WHICH WOULD BE A GLORY TO LIFE ITSELF
AROUND MY SYMPATHY HAVE YE EVER CROWDED THE INCURABLY SHAMELESS
VERILY TOO EARLY DID YE DIE FOR ME YE FUGITIVES
RATHER WILL I SIT IN A TUB UNDER A CLOSED HEAVEN RATHER WILL I SIT IN THE ABYSS WITHOUT HEAVEN THAN SEE THEE THOU LUMINOUS HEAVEN TAINTED WITH PASSING CLOUDS
BUT SICKNESS AND A SICK FRAME REMAIN EVEN IN HIS TEARS
AS YET HUMANITY HATH NOT A GOAL
I SHOULD ONLY LIKE TO POINT OUT TO THE READER THAT WE HAVE HIM HERE AT HIS BEST POKING FUN AT HIMSELF AND AT HIS FELLOW-POETS SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LXIII PARS
FOR A FATHER HE CARETH NOT SUFFICIENTLY FOR HIS CHILDREN
MORAL HONOUR
GLOOMY IS THE NIGHT GLOOMY ARE THE WAYS OF ZARATHUSTRA
SOME OTHER FORCE MUST BE OPERATIVE
WOULD THAT YE COULD NOT ENDURE IT WITH ANY KIND OF NEAR ONES OR THEIR NEIGHBOURS
I FOUND NO ONE RIPE FOR MANY OF MY THOUGHTS
AND TALK TO MINE ANIMALS OF THE HAPPINESS OF ANIMALS UNTIL I MYSELF COME HOME
IT DISLIKETH TO BE SUMMONED--SLEEP THE LORD OF THE VIRTUES
OVER-ME
SO THAT MY HOLIEST SUFFOCATED IN THE FUMES OF YOUR FAT
IN EFFECT SOLEMNLY
OF LATE DID I GAZE INTO THINE EYE O LIFE

HE DECLARED THEM TO BE LIKE ALL OTHER MORALS MERELY AN EXPEDIENT FOR PROTECTING A CERTAIN TYPE OF MAN
HATH IT UNLEARNED THE SPIRIT OF REVENGE AND ALL TEETH-GNASHING
WITH WHOM LIETH THE GREATEST DANGER TO THE WHOLE HUMAN FUTURE
AND CLOSE BESIDE IT THERE ARE A HUNDRED LURKING-PLACES AND BY-PLACES FOR CREEPING FLUTTERING AND HOPPING CREATURES
CALM IS MY SOUL AND CLEAR LIKE THE MOUNTAINS IN THE MORNING
WHO MAY NOWADAYS AWAKEN SUCH OLD SLUMBERING LIGHT-SHUNNING THINGS
BUT THE VERY QUESTION SUGGESTS ITS OWN ANSWER
I FORGIVE THEE WHAT THOU HAST DONE UNTO ME
IT IS HIS ONE ANXIETY HIS ONE GHASTLY FEAR ENGLISH EDITION PAGE 141 IN HIS FEVERISH SCURRY TO FIND ENTERTAINMENT AND DIVERSION WHETHER IN A NOVEL A NEWSPAPER OR A PLAY THE MODERN MAN CONDEMNS HIS OWN AGE UTTERLY
FREEDOM YE ALL ROAR MOST EAGERLY HE SAYS TO THE FIRE-DOG BUT I HAVE UNLEARNED THE BELIEF IN GREAT EVENTS WHEN THERE IS MUCH ROARING AND SMOKE ABOUT THEM
THE WORLD IS DEEP SIX
FOR JOYS ALL WANT THEMSELVES THEREFORE DO THEY ALSO WANT GRIEF
LET THEM HEAR ME CHATTERING AND SIGHING WITH WINTER-COLD ALL THOSE POOR SQUINTING KNAVES AROUND ME
I SHOW YOU THE LAST MAN
THOU DOST NOT BELIEVE THIS
AT LAST HE SIGHED AND DREW BREATH I AM OF TO-DAY AND HERETOFORE SAID HE THEREUPON
A LITTLE POISON NOW AND THEN
IN MINE OWN CAVE SITTETH HE THE HIGHER MAN
TO WHOM THE LOFTIEST CONCEPTION WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE REASONABLY MADE THEIR MEASURE OF VALUE WOULD ALREADY PRACTICALLY IMPLY DANGER RUIN ABASEMENT OR AT LEAST RELAXATION BLINDNESS OR TEMPORARY SELF-FORGETFULNESS
THE SELF SAITH UNTO THE EGO
I FORGET NOT MY WHIP?--NOT I 2
AWAY FROM THE MARKET-PLACE AND FROM FAME TAKETH PLACE ALL THAT IS GREAT
IT IS THE HIGHEST TIME BUT WHEN THE FIGURE WAS NEAREST TO THEM IT FLEW PAST QUICKLY HOWEVER LIKE A SHADOW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOLCANO THEN DID THEY RECOGNISE WITH THE GREATEST SURPRISE THAT IT WAS ZARATHUSTRA
AND OFT DID I ASK WITH A SHAKE OF THE HEAD
HE IS THAT LIGHTNING HE IS THAT FRENZY WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD THUS SPOKEN ONE OF THE PEOPLE CALLED OUT
WHAT WAS IT THAT FIRST MADE THEE GRUNT
WHERE FIND WE JUSTICE WHICH IS LOVE WITH SEEING EYES
BUT MORE COURAGE IS NEEDED TO MAKE AN END THAN TO MAKE A NEW VERSE
THE WHOLE HAVING OCCUPIED ME SCARCELY A YEAR
AND I AM ALSO YOUR BEST ENEMY
WITH THESE PREACHERS OF EQUALITY WILL I NOT BE MIXED UP AND CONFOUNDED
WITH THESE PREACHERS OF EQUALITY WILL I NOT BE MIXED UP AND CONFOUNDED
HE TOOK HIS STAFF AND STRUCK THE WAILER WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
THERE IS AN INSTINCT FOR RHYTHMIC RELATIONS WHICH EMBRACES WIDE AREAS OF FORMS LENGTH THE NEED OF A WIDE-EMBRACING RHYTHM IS ALMOST THE MEASURE OF THE FORCE OF AN INSPIRATION A SORT OF COUNTERPART TO ITS PRESSURE AND TENSION EVERYTHING HAPPENS QUITE INVOLUNTARILY AS IF IN A TEMPESTUOUS OUTBURST OF FREEDOM OF ABSOLUTENESS OF POWER AND DIVINITY
I WILL TO-DAY ASCEND A HIGH MOUNTAIN
ALL TOO SMALL EVEN THE GREATEST MAN!--THAT WAS MY DISGUST AT MAN
CHAPTER XXXV
THUS ONLY THUS ONLY GROWETH MAN ALOFT TO THE HEIGHT WHERE THE LIGHTNING STRIKETH AND SHATTERETH HIM
FOR MANY NOBLE ONES ARE NEEDED AND MANY KINDS OF NOBLE ONES FOR A NEW NOBILITY
AFTER THIS ZARATHUSTRA RETURNED AGAIN INTO THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SOLITUDE OF HIS CAVE AND WITHDREW HIMSELF FROM MEN WAITING LIKE A SOWER WHO HATH SCATTERED HIS SEED
AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR IT THAT BOTH ARE SO ALIKE
AND WHY SHOULD NOT ZARATHUSTRA ALSO LEARN FROM THE PEOPLE WHEN THE PEOPLE LEARN FROM ZARATHUSTRA
IT IS HE HOWEVER WHO CREATETH MAN'S GOAL AND GIVETH TO THE EARTH ITS MEANING AND ITS FUTURE
IN THOSE SPRING-TIMES AND MANY-HUED MEADOWS SHALL HE NOT BELIEVE WHO KNOWETH THE FICKLY FAINT-HEARTED HUMAN SPECIES
YE GOOD DANCERS NOW IS ALL DELIGHT OVER
BUT WHOM WOULD THAT DISGUISED AFFLICTION CONVINCE
GOD HATH DIED
BEHOLD UP THITHER IS THE CAVE OF ZARATHUSTRA
MY BROTHER THEN CALLED THIS PART THE FOURTH AND LAST
TO ONE BETTER THAN THYSELF THOU BLOCKEST THE WAY!"--AND WITH EVERY WORD HE CAME NEARER AND NEARER THE FIRST ONE
HE WAS A HIDDEN GOD FULL OF SECRECY
GIVE ME THY HAND--HA
THIS GOLDEN SADNESS OPPRESSETH IT IT DISTORTETH ITS MOUTH
THIS OPPRESSIVE AND PARALYSING SENSE OF GUILT AND OF SIN IS WHAT NIETZSCHE REFERS TO WHEN HE SPEAKS OF THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY THIS CREATURE HALF-DWARF HALF-MOLE WHOM HE BEARS WITH HIM A CERTAIN DISTANCE ON HIS CLIMB AND FINALLY DEFIES AND WHOM HE CALLS HIS DEVIL AND ARCH-ENEMY IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE HEAVY MILLSTONE GUILTY CONSCIENCE TOGETHER WITH THE CONCEPT OF SIN WHICH AT PRESENT HANGS ROUND THE NECK OF MEN
EVEN THOU COULDST WELL BECOME AN ASS THROUGH SUPERABUNDANCE OF WISDOM
ALAS THAT I HAVE TO BE LIGHT
WHERE ONE CAN NO LONGER LOVE THERE SHOULD ONE--PASS BY THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND PASSED BY THE FOOL AND THE GREAT CITY
CHURCH
DO WAIT
SAWEST THOU EVER THY FRIEND ASLEEP
THIS COURAGE AT LAST BECOME SUBTLE SPIRITUAL AND INTELLECTUAL THIS HUMAN COURAGE WITH EAGLE'S PINIONS AND SERPENT'S WISDOM
IT REFRESHETH ME SO TO HEAR YOUR TALK
FORGIVE IT HOWEVER THAT MY PRIDE HERE FINDETH EXPRESSION FOR HERE I HAVE NOT MINE EQUAL
MY HAPPINESS IN BESTOWING DIED IN BESTOWING
YE HIGHER MEN SING NOW MY ROUNDELAY
FOR TALKING WE HAVE PATIENCE AND TIME AND MORE THAN TIME
IN MY PURLIEUS DO I PROTECT EVERY ONE FROM HIS WILD BEASTS
DID I PUT THEE TO THE TEST
AND IN MAKING HYMNS I LAUGH AND WEEP AND MUMBLE
YONDER ALSO ARE THE GRAVES OF MY YOUTH
THOU ART NOW A-WEARY
SPEAK FINALLY
KNOWING FULL WELL WHAT A GHASTLY OPERATION HE IS RECOMMENDING HE NEVERTHELESS CRIES BITE
YE WOULD LIE IF YE SPAKE OTHERWISE
THAT YOUR VERY SELF BE IN YOUR ACTION AS THE MOTHER IS IN THE CHILD
ALL THE IMPERISHABLE--THAT'S BUT A SIMILE AND THE POETS LIE TOO MUCH BUT OF TIME AND OF BECOMING SHALL THE BEST SIMILES SPEAK
THE SOOTHSAYER HOWEVER DID NOT HEED ZARATHUSTRA'S ALARM BUT LISTENED AND LISTENED IN THE DOWNWARD DIRECTION
WHAT SAITH DEEP MIDNIGHT'S VOICE INDEED
WHAT SAITH DEEP MIDNIGHT'S VOICE INDEED
HERE IS MY PROMONTORY AND THERE IS THE SEA--IT ROLLETH HITHER UNTO ME SHAGGILY AND FAWNINGLY THE OLD FAITHFUL HUNDRED-HEADED DOG-MONSTER THAT I LOVE WELL
OUR DEEPEST FEELINGS CRAVE SILENCE
THE IDEAL OF A HUMANLY SUPERHUMAN WELFARE AND BENEVOLENCE WHICH WILL OFTEN ENOUGH APPEAR INHUMAN FOR EXAMPLE WHEN PUT ALONGSIDE OF ALL PAST SERIOUSNESS ON EARTH AND ALONGSIDE OF ALL PAST SOLEMNITIES IN BEARING WORD TONE LOOK MORALITY AND PURSUIT AS THEIR TRUEST INVOLUNTARY PARODY--AND WITH WHICH NEVERTHELESS PERHAPS THE GREAT SERIOUSNESS ONLY COMMENCES WHEN THE PROPER INTERROGATIVE MARK IS SET UP THE FATE OF THE SOUL CHANGES THE HOUR-HAND MOVES AND TRAGEDY BEGINS ALTHOUGH THE FIGURE OF ZARATHUSTRA AND A LARGE NUMBER OF THE LEADING THOUGHTS IN THIS WORK HAD APPEARED MUCH EARLIER IN THE DREAMS AND WRITINGS OF THE AUTHOR THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA DID NOT ACTUALLY COME INTO BEING UNTIL THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1881 IN SILS MARIA
THAT IS I'M SWALLOWED DOWN BY THIS THE SMALLEST OASIS
AND ONCE MORE BEGAN ZARATHUSTRA TO SPEAK
HE IS A FOOL WHO STILL STUMBLETH OVER STONES OR MEN
AND HE WHO HATH TOO MUCH SPIRIT MIGHT WELL BECOME INFATUATED WITH STUPIDITY AND FOLLY
BUT ALL IS ALIKE NOTHING IS WORTH WHILE NO SEEKING IS OF SERVICE THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY HAPPY ISLES THUS SIGHED THE SOOTHSAYER
ALONE WITH ONESELF!--THIS THOUGHT TERRIFIES THE MODERN SOUL
THE KING ON THE RIGHT HOWEVER ANSWERED AND SAID
ONE THING HOWEVER IS CERTAIN
TOO SLOWLY RUNNETH ALL SPEAKING FOR ME:--INTO THY CHARIOT O STORM DO I LEAP
THEN DID I LEARN THAT THEY COME OUT OF THE SEA
TEN TRUTHS MUST THOU FIND DURING THE DAY
GOOD AND EVIL WHICH WOULD BE EVERLASTING--IT DOTH NOT EXIST
EVEN IN YOUR EARS YE GREAT SOULS IT WHISPERETH ITS GLOOMY LIES
AND WHITHER
THAT IT MAY GIVE TO THE EARTH ITS MEANING A HUMAN MEANING
AND VERILY IF LIFE HAD NO SENSE AND HAD I TO CHOOSE NONSENSE THIS WOULD BE THE DESIRABLEST NONSENSE FOR ME ALSO
BLOOD THEIR BLOODLESS SOULS CRAVE FOR--AND THEY STING THEREFORE IN ALL INNOCENCE
UPBRAID ME NOT YE BEAUTIFUL DANCERS WHEN I CHASTEN THE LITTLE GOD SOMEWHAT
TASTE
BUT SOMETHING IS IN ME THAT IS OF THE MORROW AND THE DAY FOLLOWING AND THE HEREAFTER
BUT FROM WEARINESS HATH HE LAIN DOWN OBSTINATELY IN THE DUST THIS BRAVE ONE
AS YET THOU ART NOT FREE
WEEP YE NOT YE DATE-FRUIT SPIRITS
THIS IS NOT THE NATURAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL PESSIMISM WHICH PROCEEDS FROM AN UNHEALTHY BODY--THE DYSPEPTIC'S LACK OF APPETITE
THUS SEEKETH HE HIS OWN DOWN-GOING
FOR OVERCOMING IS BITTERNESS AND BADLY SLEEP THE UNRECONCILED
YE FLEE FROM ME
THEN WOULD YE HAVE TO CREATE YOUR FRIEND AND HIS OVERFLOWING HEART OUT OF YOURSELVES
IT WAS LIKE THE VOICE OF SPRING TO OLD WINE-CASKS
WELL THEN UP NOW MINE OLD HEART
THE ATMOSPHERE RARE AND PURE DANGER NEAR AND THE SPIRIT FULL OF A JOYFUL WICKEDNESS
THOU KNOWEST IT WELL
NOW MUST THOU DAILY THRUST THY HEAD DEEPER INTO OBSCURITY AND VAPOUR
YE DO NOT MEAN TO SLAY YE JUDGES AND SACRIFICERS UNTIL THE ANIMAL HATH BOWED ITS HEAD
FOR IN EVERY ATTACK THERE IS SOUND OF TRIUMPH
IN MY DREAM IN MY LAST MORNING-DREAM I STOOD TO-DAY ON A PROMONTORY BEYOND THE WORLD
A HUNDRED TIMES HITHERTO HATH SPIRIT AS WELL AS VIRTUE FLOWN AWAY AND BLUNDERED
THUS IS THE WILL'S TEETH-GNASHING AND LONESOMEST TRIBULATION CALLED
ANTHONY M
AND AT LAST IT TURNED INTO HUMAN VOICE AND HUMAN SPEECH:--IT SOUNDED THUS
MODESTLY TO EMBRACE A SMALL HAPPINESS--THAT DO THEY CALL SUBMISSION
TOO MUCH MISCARRIED WITH HIM THIS POTTER WHO HAD NOT LEARNED THOROUGHLY
BESTOWING DEVELOPS INTO A MEANS OF EXISTENCE AND THIS IS THE ONLY GIVING THE ONLY CHARITY THAT NIETZSCHE RECOGNISES
OTHERWISE IT WILL HAUNT THEE IN THE NIGHT
RUMINATING
FORMERLY ALL THE WORLD WAS INSANE,"--SAY THE SUBTLEST OF THEM AND BLINK THEREBY
IT IS MY POVERTY THAT MY HAND NEVER CEASETH BESTOWING
CERTAINLY HOWEVER THOU ART AVERSE TO FLESHLY JOYS AND THOU LOVEST HONEY THOU HAST DIVINED ME WELL ANSWERED THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR WITH LIGHTENED HEART
AND THIS LIE CREEPETH FROM ITS MOUTH
IT IS A SATIRE ON MODERN MAN AND HIS BELITTLING VIRTUES

NIETZSCHE ARCHIVES WEIMAR DECEMBER 1905
SEE THERE HOW SHE COMETH IMPATIENTLY OVER THE SEA
INDEED HOW WOULD YE BE ABLE TO BELIEVE YE DIVERS-COLOURED ONES!--YE WHO ARE PICTURES OF ALL THAT HATH EVER BEEN BELIEVED
THERE COMMENCETH THE SONG OF THE NECESSARY ONES THE SINGLE AND IRREPLACEABLE MELODY
MEN ARE NOT EQUAL AND NEITHER SHALL THEY BECOME SO
THE CREATING BODY CREATED FOR ITSELF SPIRIT AS A HAND TO ITS WILL
FOR ALWAYS DO THEY DRAW AS ASSES--THE PEOPLE'S CARTS
THE SPIRIT AND VIRTUE OF THY MASTER SHALL ADVANCE BY THOU BEING HIS SERVANT
DID MY LOATHING ITSELF CREATE FOR ME WINGS AND FOUNTAIN-DIVINING POWERS
STILL STRETCHING THYSELF YAWNING SIGHING FALLING INTO DEEP WELLS
IN VAIN WAS ALL OUR LABOUR POISON HATH OUR WINE BECOME THE EVIL EYE HATH SINGED YELLOW OUR FIELDS AND HEARTS
I MYSELF HAVE PUT ON THIS CROWN
FORGIVE ME MY SADNESS
WHAT THEY DO NOT FATHOM IS UNFATHOMABLE
EVEN IF YE ACT FOR YOUR NEIGHBOUR"--YE STILL DO NOT CREATE FOR HIM
FOR JOY ALTHOUGH WOE BE DEEP JOY IS DEEPER STILL THAN GRIEF CAN BE
BUT I SAY UNTO YOU
FROM HIGH MOUNTAINS CAST DOWN THY GLITTERING SCORN-LAUGHTER
AND STILL STRANGER SOUNDETH MY WORD UNTO ALL INK-FISH AND PEN-FOXES
AND THAT MAN MUST BECOME BETTER AND BADDER NOT TO THIS TORTURE-STAKE WAS I TIED THAT I KNOW MAN IS BAD,--BUT I CRIED AS NO ONE HATH YET CRIED
LO THIS IS THE TARANTULA'S DEN
THEN HOWEVER HE PUT ON A DIFFERENT EXPRESSION
HERE AM I AT HOME AND IN MY PROVINCE
AND VERILY WHAT I SAW THE LIKE HAD I NEVER SEEN
O ZARATHUSTRA THOU ART A ROGUE
WHAT GOOD IS MY HAPPINESS
I SLEPT WELL AND LAUGHED WELL--I WAS PERFECTLY ROBUST AND PATIENT AS WE HAVE SEEN EACH OF THE THREE PARTS OF ZARATHUSTRA WAS WRITTEN AFTER A MORE OR LESS SHORT PERIOD OF PREPARATION IN ABOUT TEN DAYS
HATH NOT MY WORLD JUST NOW BECOME PERFECT
EVEN THE MAGICIAN LAUGHED AND SAID WISELY
DO EVER WHAT YE WILL--BUT FIRST BE SUCH AS CAN WILL
AND IMMEDIATELY WERT THOU READY TO LOVE AND LURE IT
WHO CARRIETH HIS ASHES UNTO THE MOUNTAIN
LXII
LXII
VERILY THE WILL TO DEATH INDICATETH THIS SIGN
BUT THEY KNOW NEITHER HOW TO TAKE NOR HOW TO RETAIN THEM
A TABLE OF EXCELLENCIES HANGETH OVER EVERY PEOPLE
ALL THAT INCREASES POWER IS GOOD ALL THAT SPRINGS FROM WEAKNESS IS BAD
YEA I KNOW THY DANGER
ONE THING IS MORE NECESSARY THAN THE OTHER ONLY THAT HIS EYES REMAINED OPEN:--FOR THEY NEVER GREW WEARY OF VIEWING AND ADMIRING THE TREE AND THE LOVE OF THE VINE
AND BETTER STILL
BE ON YOUR GUARD
IN THIS POSSESSING SHALL EVERYTHING BE ASSURANCE AND NOTHING DESIRE
GOD IS SAID TO BE ETERNAL ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE MOST PIOUS
EVENING HATH COME ON
BUT BROODING LAY THE SUN OF MY LOVE UPON ME IN HIS OWN JUICE STEWED ZARATHUSTRA,--THEN DID SHADOWS AND DOUBTS FLY PAST ME
HOW IT SIGHETH
TO-DAY SUFFEREST THOU STILL FROM THE MULTITUDE THOU INDIVIDUAL
O MY BRETHREN AM I THEN CRUEL
AND IF IT BE NOT GIVEN US THEN DO WE TAKE IT:--THE BEST FOOD THE PUREST SKY THE STRONGEST THOUGHTS THE FAIREST WOMEN THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
LET MINE ANIMALS LEAD ME
LET MINE ANIMALS LEAD ME
HE HOWEVER WHO OBEYETH DOTH NOT LISTEN TO HIMSELF
COME AND IMMEDIATELY IT BECAME STILL AND MYSTERIOUS ROUND ABOUT
FOR IT WAS A VALLEY WHICH ALL ANIMALS AVOIDED EVEN THE BEASTS OF PREY EXCEPT THAT A SPECIES OF UGLY THICK GREEN SERPENT CAME HERE TO DIE WHEN THEY BECAME OLD
HE HAD COME OUT AT A LITTLE DOOR AND WAS GOING ALONG THE ROPE WHICH WAS STRETCHED BETWEEN TWO TOWERS SO THAT IT HUNG ABOVE THE MARKET-PLACE AND THE PEOPLE
WHEN HOWEVER HE STOOD OVER AGAINST IT NOT MORE THAN TWENTY PACES THEREFROM THE THING HAPPENED WHICH HE NOW LEAST OF ALL EXPECTED
NIETZSCHE IS ABLE TO THINK CHEERFULLY AND OPTIMISTICALLY OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LIFE IN THIS WORLD RECURRING AGAIN AND AGAIN WHEN HE HAS ONCE CAST THE DWARF FROM HIS SHOULDERS AND HE ANNOUNCES HIS DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS GREAT AND SMALL TO HIS ARCH-ENEMY AND IN DEFIANCE OF HIM
FOR THIS TO-DAY IS THAT OF THE POPULACE
AND THEY ELEVATE THEMSELVES ONLY THAT THEY MAY LOWER OTHERS
WHAT DOTH YOUR BODY SAY ABOUT YOUR SOUL
TO THAT END HOWEVER I WOULD FAIN LEARN OF THESE KINE
AND WILL TO EQUALITY'--THAT ITSELF SHALL HENCEFORTH BE THE NAME OF VIRTUE
HE WAS TEMPTED TO THEM ON THE PREVIOUS DAY HE SAYS BUT THAT HATH HAD ITS TIME
AH MY BRETHREN HOW COULD FIRSTLINGS FAIL TO BE SACRIFICES
ALL BEING WOULD YE MAKE THINKABLE
THY FULNESS LOOKETH FORTH OVER RAGING SEAS AND SEEKETH AND WAITETH
I--RUN AWAY FROM IT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA TO HIS HEART AND RAN AWAY
THEY CALLED GOD THAT WHICH OPPOSED AND AFFLICTED THEM
BUT JOYS ALL WANT ETERNITY WANT DEEP PROFOUND ETERNITY LXXX
WHAT DO I HERE SEEK ANSWERED HE
HOW THE HEARTS OF ALL OF YOU CONVULSED WITH DELIGHT AND WICKEDNESS BECAUSE YE HAD AT LAST BECOME AGAIN LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN--NAMELY PIOUS BECAUSE YE AT LAST DID AGAIN AS CHILDREN DO--NAMELY PRAYED FOLDED YOUR HANDS AND SAID GOOD GOD
UNTO IT ALL SUCH RAGE AND HATRED AND FOAMING-OVER IS REPUGNANT
AND HOW WOULD YE ENDURE LIFE WITHOUT THAT HOPE YE DISCERNING ONES
SO REVOLVETH ALSO THE PRINCE AROUND WHAT IS EARTHLIEST OF ALL--THAT HOWEVER IS THE GOLD OF THE SHOPMAN
IT IS THE STILLEST WORDS WHICH BRING THE STORM
OR DISCORD IN THEE
AND THERE SHOULD BE NO FESTIVAL AT WHICH SUCH A DYING ONE DOTH NOT CONSECRATE THE OATHS OF THE LIVING
THY VERY MALADY WOULDST THOU WHITEWASH IF THOU SHOWED THYSELF NAKED TO THY PHYSICIAN
IT WILL HONOUR MY CAVE IF KINGS WANT TO SIT AND WAIT IN IT
A STATE IS CALLED THE COLDEST OF ALL COLD MONSTERS
THOU NONDESCRIPT SAID HE THOU WARNEDST ME AGAINST THY PATH
THY SILENT PRIDE IS ALWAYS COUNTER TO THEIR TASTE
ONE OUGHT STILL TO HONOUR THE ENEMY IN ONE'S FRIEND
VERILY A PLACE OF HEALING SHALL THE EARTH BECOME
AH YE BRETHREN THAT GOD WHOM I CREATED WAS HUMAN WORK AND HUMAN MADNESS LIKE ALL THE GODS
FOR THE HEAVY AND THE HEAVIEST LONGETH ITS STRENGTH
AND WHEN HE HASTILY LOOKED AROUND AND STOOD UP BEHOLD THERE STOOD THE SOOTHSAYER BESIDE HIM THE SAME WHOM HE HAD ONCE GIVEN TO EAT AND DRINK AT HIS TABLE THE PROCLAIMER OF THE GREAT WEARINESS WHO TAUGHT
AT MY WORK I WANT TO BE AT MY DAY
AN INSTRUMENT OF THY BODY IS ALSO THY LITTLE SAGACITY MY BROTHER WHICH THOU CALLEST SPIRIT"--A LITTLE INSTRUMENT AND PLAYTHING OF THY BIG SAGACITY
AND THAT THOU WERT MORE FORSAKEN AMONGST THE MANY THOU UNIQUE ONE THAN THOU EVER WERT WITH ME
HOW I NOW LOVE EVERY ONE UNTO WHOM I MAY BUT SPEAK
IT ALWAYS BESTOWETH ITSELF
MEANWHILE THE MAGICIAN WAGNER SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY IN ORDER TO DRAW THEM ALL INTO HIS NET ONCE MORE SINGS THE SONG OF MELANCHOLY
FOR ALL THINGS ARE BAPTIZED AT THE FONT OF ETERNITY AND BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL
11 12
THUS DID ZARATHUSTRA GO ABOUT GRIEVED IN HIS HEART AND FOR THREE DAYS HE DID NOT TAKE ANY MEAT OR DRINK
CONFINED AND AWKWARD ARE STILL HIS SOUL AND THE WINGS OF HIS SPIRIT
THOU SHALT STEAL AWAY FROM THYSELF LUST IS SIN,"--SO SAY SOME WHO PREACH DEATH--"LET US GO APART AND BEGET NO CHILDREN GIVING BIRTH IS TROUBLESOME,"--SAY OTHERS--"WHY STILL GIVE BIRTH
WE HAVE NOT YET TIME FOR ZARATHUSTRA"--SO THEY OBJECT
IN FALLING ASLEEP HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA SPAKE THUS TO HIS HEART
PARS
PARS
PARS
PARS
PARS
WHO IS THIS WITH WHOM I TALK HE EXCLAIMED FRIGHTENED AND SPRANG UP FROM THE GROUND
ITS BREAST CAVED IN
TO THE PINE DO I COMPARE HIM O ZARATHUSTRA WHICH GROWETH UP LIKE THEE--TALL SILENT HARDY SOLITARY OF THE BEST SUPPLEST WOOD STATELY IN THE END HOWEVER GRASPING OUT FOR ITS DOMINION WITH STRONG GREEN BRANCHES ASKING WEIGHTY QUESTIONS OF THE WIND THE STORM AND WHATEVER IS AT HOME ON HIGH PLACES
WHATEVER MAKETH THEM RULE AND CONQUER AND SHINE TO THE DISMAY AND ENVY OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS THEY REGARD AS THE HIGH AND FOREMOST THING THE TEST AND THE MEANING OF ALL ELSE
O WORLD THOU WANTEST ME
AND WHEN THEY HAD WALKED A WHILE TOGETHER ZARATHUSTRA BEGAN TO SPEAK THUS
THOU ART MY SHADOW SAID HE AT LAST SADLY
A GOLDEN BARK SAW I GLEAM ON DARKENED WATERS A SINKING DRINKING REBLINKING GOLDEN SWING-BARK
FOR ONE DAY MUST IT YET COME AND MAY NOT PASS BY
IN SUCH WISE THAT LOVE AND AWE WERE COMBINED IN EQUAL DEGREE
I AM MORE FORBEARING TO THE VAIN THAN TO THE PROUD
JUST THEN DID IT STAND STILL A GLOWING GLOBE--AT REST ON THE FLAT ROOF AS IF ON SOME ONE'S PROPERTY THEREBY HAD THE DOG BEEN TERRIFIED
BUT TELL ME WHAT SEEKEST THOU HERE IN MY FORESTS AND ROCKS
AND AT LAST ASKETH THEIR WEARINESS
WHERE GOETH THE THIEF
AND AGAIN THERE ARE THOSE WHO SIT IN THEIR SWAMP AND SPEAK THUS FROM AMONG THE BULRUSHES
BUT MY PITY IS NOT A CRUCIFIXION HAVE YE EVER SPOKEN THUS
THAT IS AT PRESENT THE NOBLEST TYPE
CONCERNING WOMAN ONE SHOULD ONLY TALK UNTO MEN TALK ALSO UNTO ME OF WOMAN SAID SHE
THERE ARE SO MANY CONVULSIONS OF THE AMBITIONS
DO SPEAK UNTO ME OF MY GARDENS OF MY HAPPY ISLES OF MY NEW BEAUTIFUL RACE--WHY DO YE NOT SPEAK UNTO ME THEREOF
HOW COULD YE BE JUST UNTO ME!"--MUST THOU SAY--"I CHOOSE YOUR INJUSTICE AS MY ALLOTTED PORTION INJUSTICE AND FILTH CAST THEY AT THE LONESOME ONE
MUCH IS RECKONED HIGHER THAN LIFE ITSELF BY THE LIVING ONE NIETZSCHE SAYS THAT TO SPEAK OF THE ACTIVITY OF LIFE AS A STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE IS TO STATE THE CASE INADEQUATELY
AND ALAS THAT SUCH AS THOU SHOULD TALK AND MAKE ADO ABOUT THE TRUTH
FOR LO
AN EXALTED ONE SHALL HE BE AND NOT ONLY A SUBLIME ONE:--THE ETHER ITSELF SHOULD RAISE HIM THE WILL-LESS ONE
BETTER BREAK THE WINDOWS AND JUMP INTO THE OPEN AIR
THAT THE MERITED STAR MAY AT LAST STICK ON THE SLENDER BREAST
THOU FOOL THOU DOST NOT KNOW MEN ONE UNLEARNETH MEN WHEN ONE LIVETH AMONGST THEM
BUT IT SHALL ACCOMMODATE AND BEND ITSELF TO YOU
THE POPULACE HOWEVER BLINKETH
GO
GO
GO
GO
GLADLY IT BASKETH IN THE SUNSHINE OF GOOD CONSCIENCES,--THE COLD MONSTER
BELIEVE ME MY BRETHREN
BELIEVE ME MY BRETHREN
VERILY A POLLUTED STREAM IS MAN
OUR LONGING FOR A FRIEND IS OUR BETRAYER
DEPART HOWEVER FROM THIS TOWN,--OR TOMORROW I SHALL JUMP OVER THEE A LIVING MAN OVER A DEAD ONE AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS THE BUFFOON VANISHED
PITY OVERCAME HIM
AND I SERVED THAT OLD GOD UNTIL HIS LAST HOUR
GOETH HE NOT ALONG LIKE A DANCER
THOU GOEST THE WAY TO THY GREATNESS
THOU GOEST THE WAY TO THY GREATNESS
THOU GOEST THE WAY TO THY GREATNESS
COURAGE SEEMETH TO ME THE ENTIRE PRIMITIVE HISTORY OF MAN CHAPTER LXXVI
BUT GOD DIED AND THEREWITH ALSO THOSE BLASPHEMERS
TO CHOOSE THAT PATH WHICH MAN HATH FOLLOWED BLINDLY AND TO APPROVE OF IT--AND NO LONGER TO SLINK ASIDE FROM IT LIKE THE SICK AND PERISHING
THIS IT SEEMETH TO ME IS CALLED AT PRESENT ZARATHUSTRA CRIED ALL OF THEM THERE ASSEMBLED AS IF WITH ONE VOICE AND BURST OUT AT THE SAME TIME INTO A GREAT LAUGHTER
AND ON THE RULERS TURNED I MY BACK WHEN I SAW WHAT THEY NOW CALL RULING
BUT ALREADY HAST THOU BECOME HOLLOW BY THE NUMEROUS DROPS
BUT I WILL SOON BRING YOUR HIDING-PLACES TO THE LIGHT
WHAT DOTH IT MATTER 2
WHO STILL KNOWETH WHAT IS GREAT AND WHAT IS SMALL
MAY MY DESTINY EVER LEAD UNAFFLICTED ONES LIKE YOU ACROSS MY PATH AND THOSE WITH WHOM I MAY HAVE HOPE AND REPAST AND HONEY IN COMMON
BUT THE FEET OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE BECAME WEARY AND NOW DO THEY MALIGN EVEN THEIR MORNING VALOUR
FROM THENCE CAME TO ME ALSO THE VOICE OF GOD STIFF-NECKED AND ARTFUL LIKE THE ASS HAVE YE ALWAYS BEEN AS THE ADVOCATES OF THE PEOPLE
AND HE WHO WOULD NOT LANGUISH AMONGST MEN MUST LEARN TO DRINK OUT OF ALL GLASSES
AND HE WHO WOULD NOT LANGUISH AMONGST MEN MUST LEARN TO DRINK OUT OF ALL GLASSES
WHAT SEEKST THOU BY THY HEARKENING
UP
UP
UP
UP
UP
UP
CLATTERING WITH DICTION AND DICE I OUTWIT THE SOLEMN ASSISTANTS
HERE PAUSED ZARATHUSTRA AWHILE AND LOOKED LOVINGLY ON HIS DISCIPLES
GHOST-BREATHING AND GHOST-WHISKING SEEMETH TO ME ALL THE JINGLE-JANGLING OF THEIR HARPS
MY PAST BURST ITS TOMB MANY PAINS BURIED ALIVE WOKE UP
NIETZSCHE ALWAYS HAD HIGH IDEALS FOR HUMANITY
DEAD ARE ALL THE GODS
BUT BLOOD IS THE VERY WORST WITNESS TO TRUTH
AND ESPECIALLY HAVE I A GRUDGE AGAINST ALL ARDENT STEAMING STEAMY FIRE-IDOLS
FROM PITY THERE COMETH A HEAVY CLOUD
LONG VERILY SHOULD WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SOME ONE RE-AWOKE THY GOD FOR THEE
I AM A LAW ONLY FOR MINE OWN
IMMODESTLY HE CARRIETH HIS HORN
LET NOT THE EXALTED ONE RELAPSE AGAIN INTO HIS LOW ESTATE
BUT THEY LACK FISTS
LIFE IS REFUTED BUT THEY ONLY ARE REFUTED AND THEIR EYE WHICH SEETH ONLY ONE ASPECT OF EXISTENCE
HE HATH SUBDUED MONSTERS HE HATH SOLVED ENIGMAS
VERILY THERE SHALL BE NO I WILL ANY MORE
AS A WHITE OX WOULD I LIKE TO SEE HIM WHICH SNORTING AND LOWING WALKETH BEFORE THE PLOUGH-SHARE
ON AN ETERNAL GROUND ON HARD PRIMARY ROCK ON THIS HIGHEST HARDEST PRIMARY MOUNTAIN-RIDGE UNTO WHICH ALL WINDS COME AS UNTO THE STORM-PARTING ASKING WHERE
SO THEY WANT TO MAKE OTHERS SUFFER
LXXVI
LXXVI
ALL THINGS LONG FOR THEE SINCE THOU HAST REMAINED ALONE FOR SEVEN DAYS--STEP FORTH OUT OF THY CAVE
WHICH HATETH THE CONSUMPTIVE POPULACE-DOGS AND ALL THE ILL-CONSTITUTED SULLEN BROOD:--PRAISED BE THIS SPIRIT OF ALL FREE SPIRITS THE LAUGHING STORM WHICH BLOWETH DUST INTO THE EYES OF ALL THE MELANOPIC AND MELANCHOLIC
THE LAST TWO VERSES OF PAR
SO CALLED EVERYTHING UNTO ME IN SIGNS
RATHER WOULD I SLEEP ON OX-SKINS THAN ON THEIR HONOURS AND DIGNITIES
FOR HARDLY CAN HE RUN WHEN HIS VICES RUN AWAY WITH HIM--SO DO THE PEOPLE TEACH CONCERNING CRIPPLES
I BUILD A MOUNTAIN-RANGE OUT OF EVER HOLIER MOUNTAINS BUT WHEREVER YE WOULD ASCEND WITH ME O MY BRETHREN TAKE CARE LEST A PARASITE ASCEND WITH YOU
ONCE MORE MY FRIENDS WHAT THINK YE
THERE IS AN OLD ILLUSION--IT IS CALLED GOOD AND EVIL
THUS LIKE FIGS DO THESE DOCTRINES FALL FOR YOU MY FRIENDS
AND YE WANT TO BE THE EBB OF THAT GREAT TIDE AND WOULD RATHER GO BACK TO THE BEAST THAN SURPASS MAN
THAT IS BECAUSE YE HAVE HAD TO BE MOTHERS
I AM NOT GREAT THEREIN DO I HONOUR THEE AS A PENITENT-IN-SPIRIT AND ALTHOUGH ONLY FOR THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE IN THAT ONE MOMENT WAST THOU--GENUINE
HAST THOU NOT THE SISTER-SOUL OF MINE INSIGHT
YE WOULD STILL CREATE A WORLD BEFORE WHICH YE CAN BOW THE KNEE
THE SICK AND PERISHING--IT WAS THEY WHO DESPISED THE BODY AND THE EARTH AND INVENTED THE HEAVENLY WORLD AND THE REDEEMING BLOOD-DROPS
AS THE ANCIENT POETS RELATE IT
WHAT OF FATHERLAND
HAD I AWAKENED
AND DEEPER THAN THE DAY COULD READ
WHO IS TO BE MASTER OF THE WORLD
WHO IS TO BE MASTER OF THE WORLD
WHO IS TO BE MASTER OF THE WORLD
VERILY THEY THEMSELVES DIDST THOU DREAM THINE ENEMIES
HE SAYS IN A LETTER TO ME
MANLY PRUDENCE
MANLY PRUDENCE
MANLY PRUDENCE
AND OTHERS ARE THERE WHO ARE LIKE EIGHT-DAY CLOCKS WHEN WOUND UP
WHEN THY STILLEST HOUR CAME AND DROVE THEE FORTH FROM THYSELF WHEN WITH WICKED WHISPERING IT SAID
WOULD THAT ANOTHER CHILD PUT THEM AGAIN INTO THE BOX
AND READILY DOTH HE SOIL HIMSELF WHO TOUCHETH THEM
SO MUCH FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ASS AS AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP
LET THEM GO AND FALL AWAY O ZARATHUSTRA AND DO NOT LAMENT
IN THE PENULTIMATE VERSE HE MAKES KNOWN HIS DISCOVERY CONCERNING THE ROOT OF MODERN NIHILISM AND INDIFFERENCE,--I.E THAT MODERN MAN HAS NO GOAL NO AIM NO IDEALS SEE NOTE A CHAPTER XVIII
WHAT HAPPENED MY BRETHREN
DIDST THOU EVER SEE HOW CAPTURED CRIMINALS SLEEP
THEY PLAYED BY THE SEA--THEN CAME THERE A WAVE AND SWEPT THEIR PLAYTHINGS INTO THE DEEP
EVERYTHING AMONG THEM TALKETH NOTHING SUCCEEDETH ANY LONGER AND ACCOMPLISHETH ITSELF
FOR I HAVE POSSESSED YOU AND YE POSSESS ME STILL
VERILY A GOAL HAD ZARATHUSTRA
TO-NIGHT SHALT THOU THERE BE MY WELCOME GUEST
WHAT HAVE I NOT SURRENDERED WHAT WOULD I NOT SURRENDER THAT I MIGHT HAVE ONE THING
WHEREVER I FIND SUCH CLOCKS I SHALL WIND THEM UP WITH MY MOCKERY AND THEY SHALL EVEN WHIRR THEREBY
A TOOTHLESS MOUTH HATH NO LONGER THE RIGHT TO EVERY TRUTH
FOR WHEN ONE LETTETH IT GO HOW QUICKLY DOTH ONE'S HEAD RUN AWAY
DESTROYERS ARE THEY WHO LAY SNARES FOR MANY AND CALL IT THE STATE
O HAPPINESS BEFORE EVENTIDE
IN THE PATHS OF LOVE THROUGH BUSHES VARIEGATED QUIET TRIM
THAT UPLIFTETH US OURSELVES
THAT LEAVES BECOME WITHERED,--WHAT IS THERE TO LAMENT ABOUT THAT
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA WENT ONE DAY OVER THE GREAT BRIDGE THEN DID THE CRIPPLES AND BEGGARS SURROUND HIM AND A HUNCHBACK SPAKE THUS UNTO HIM
THUS DOTH IT CAUSE LONGING FOR THE SUPERMAN
SO HE FORGOT THE TIME
TO SUCH A MAN GIVING FROM HIS OVERFLOW BECOMES A NECESSITY
FOR HE WAS FOND OF GOING ALONE
I DO NOT LIKE YOUR COLD JUSTICE
THAT YOUR DYING MAY NOT BE A REPROACH TO MAN AND THE EARTH MY FRIENDS
NONE OF YOU HOWEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF MY DANGER NAMELY PERISHING OF HUNGER THUS SPAKE THE SOOTHSAYER
ON THESE DO WE SET OUR GAUDY PUPPETS AND THEN CALL THEM GODS AND SUPERMEN ARE NOT THEY LIGHT ENOUGH FOR THOSE CHAIRS!--ALL THESE GODS AND SUPERMEN AH HOW I AM WEARY OF ALL THE INADEQUATE THAT IS INSISTED ON AS ACTUAL
FOR JUST NOW DO THE NOCTURNAL BIRDS AGAIN FLY ABROAD
EVEN MY DECEPTIVE DREAM LAUGHETH
THROUGH FEAR EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED ORIGINAL SIN AND ORIGINAL VIRTUE
HUMILITY HATH THE HARDEST SKIN AND I ANSWERED
YEA MY FISH-BONES SHELLS AND PRICKLY LEAVES SHALL--TICKLE THE NOSES OF DISSEMBLERS
DESTROY I PRAY YOU DESTROY THAT WORD OF THE SOFT-HEARTED AND HALF-AND-HALF
OF WHICH ISLE THE PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY THE OLD WOMEN AMONGST THEM SAY THAT IT IS PLACED AS A ROCK BEFORE THE GATE OF THE NETHER-WORLD
THE AIR IS PURE AND TO-DAY ONE SEETH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN EVER."--"YEA MINE ANIMALS ANSWERED HE YE COUNSEL ADMIRABLY AND ACCORDING TO MY HEART
HONOUR TO THE GOVERNMENT AND OBEDIENCE AND ALSO TO THE CROOKED GOVERNMENT
BUT ONE IS CAREFUL LEST THE PASTIME SHOULD HURT ONE
AND IF I HOLD NOT ITS MOUTH IT SCREAMETH TOO LOUDLY
BE AT LEAST MINE ENEMY!"--THUS SPEAKETH THE TRUE REVERENCE WHICH DOTH NOT VENTURE TO SOLICIT FRIENDSHIP
MY VOICE IS A MEDICINE EVEN FOR THOSE BORN BLIND
TELL ME MY BROTHER WHAT DO WE THINK BAD AND WORST OF ALL
IN THE MEANTIME OF COURSE THE ROPE-DANCER HAD COMMENCED HIS PERFORMANCE
ON THAT ACCOUNT WOMAN IS NOT YET CAPABLE OF FRIENDSHIP
FOR HE SHOWS THAT IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS HE DESPISES HIMSELF
LET THIS LOVE BE YOUR NEW NOBILITY,--THE UNDISCOVERED IN THE REMOTEST SEAS
AS BOTH OF THEM THEN START UP AND SNAP AT EACH OTHER LIKE DEADLY ENEMIES THOSE TWO BEINGS MORTALLY FRIGHTENED--SO DID IT HAPPEN UNTO US
AND BEST OF ALL WOULD I LIKE TO PUT EVERY SORROWFUL ONE AGAIN ON FIRM LAND AND FIRM LEGS
HE ALWAYS COMETH TOO LATE THAT CURSED DWARF AND CLUB-FOOT THUS CURSED ZARATHUSTRA IMPATIENTLY IN HIS HEART AND CONSIDERED HOW WITH AVERTED LOOK HE MIGHT SLIP PAST THE BLACK MAN
THE BLIND CANST THOU HEAL AND MAKE THE LAME RUN
FOR ESPECIALLY WICKED AM I IN THE MORNING
AND NOT FROM YOU YE PRESENT-DAY MEN SHALL MY GREAT WEARINESS ARISE AH WHITHER SHALL I NOW ASCEND WITH MY LONGING
TO ALL THOSE BELAUDED SAGES OF THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS WISDOM WAS SLEEP WITHOUT DREAMS
O HEAVEN ABOVE ME THOU PURE THOU DEEP HEAVEN
WHEN HE ENTERED THE FOREST HOWEVER THERE SUDDENLY STOOD BEFORE HIM AN OLD MAN WHO HAD LEFT HIS HOLY COT TO SEEK ROOTS
WOULD THAT I HAD HEARD YOU CRYING THUS
TOO MANY ACTORS FOUND I THERE AND EVEN THE SPECTATORS OFTEN BEHAVED LIKE ACTORS
NOBODY CARRIETH GOLD IN HIS MOUTH
TEN TIMES MUST THOU LAUGH DURING THE DAY AND BE CHEERFUL
FOR WITH THOSE THE PREACHING OF DEATH IS STILL MOST AT HOME
KEYS DID I CARRY THE RUSTIEST OF ALL KEYS
AND WHY WILL YE NOT PLUCK AT MY WREATH
WILD BEASTS ALSO DID I HEAR HOWLING
IF HOWEVER THOU WILT GIVE UNTO THEM GIVE THEM NO MORE THAN AN ALMS AND LET THEM ALSO BEG FOR IT NO REPLIED ZARATHUSTRA I GIVE NO ALMS
THE SPIRIT ITSELF BUBBLETH AND SMOKETH WHEN THE RABBLE APPROACH THE FIRE
STOP THIS AT ONCE ZARATHUSTRA CRIES LONG HAVE THY SPEECH AND THY SPECIES DISGUSTED ME...OUT OF LOVE ALONE SHALL MY CONTEMPT AND MY WARNING BIRD TAKE WING
LO I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN
LO I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN
LO I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN
WHEREVER I FOUND A LIVING THING THERE FOUND I WILL TO POWER
I COME AGAIN WITH THIS SUN WITH THIS EARTH WITH THIS EAGLE WITH THIS SERPENT--NOT TO A NEW LIFE OR A BETTER LIFE OR A SIMILAR LIFE
HAVE I SPOKEN UNSPEAKABLE THINGS
SUFFICIENTLY FORMIDABLE UNTO ME HATH THY WEIGHT EVER BEEN
HOW WEARY I AM OF MY GOOD AND MY BAD
FOR TO ITS POSSESSOR IS ALL POSSESSION WELL CONCEALED AND OF ALL TREASURE-PITS ONE'S OWN IS LAST EXCAVATED--SO CAUSETH THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY
AND WHAT RELIEVETH IN THE DIREST DISTRESS THE UNIQUE AND HARDEST OF ALL,--THEY EXTOL AS HOLY
BUT THE WORST ENEMY THOU CANST MEET WILT THOU THYSELF ALWAYS BE
THEIR NOISE AROUND ME SPREADETH A MANTLE OVER MY THOUGHTS
HE WHO HATH GROWN WISE CONCERNING OLD ORIGINS LO HE WILL AT LAST SEEK AFTER THE FOUNTAINS OF THE FUTURE AND NEW ORIGINS O MY BRETHREN NOT LONG WILL IT BE UNTIL NEW PEOPLES SHALL ARISE AND NEW FOUNTAINS SHALL RUSH DOWN INTO NEW DEPTHS
NIETZSCHE ADMITS HERE THAT AT ONE TIME HE HAD THOUGHT OF APPEALING TO THE PEOPLE TO THE CROWD IN THE MARKET-PLACE BUT THAT HE HAD ULTIMATELY TO ABANDON THE TASK
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA WAS ALONE HOWEVER HE SAID TO HIS HEART
LXVI
LXVI
THOUGH I BE ALONE IN AN EMPTY HOUSE AND MUST SING IT TO MINE OWN EARS
THAT CREATED ALL GODS AND BACKWORLDS
CHANGE OF VALUES--THAT IS CHANGE OF THE CREATING ONES
AND I KNOW ALSO WHAT IS IN THY SOUL
HE HOWEVER WHO IS OF THE HIGHEST SPECIES FEEDETH MOST PARASITES
21
EGO
A LAUGHING-STOCK A THING OF SHAME
A LAUGHING-STOCK A THING OF SHAME
IT IS YOUR THIRST TO BECOME SACRIFICES AND GIFTS YOURSELVES
SO SHALL IT BE SAID ZARATHUSTRA WITH GREAT ASTONISHMENT
THE WISEST SOUL UNTO WHICH FOLLY SPEAKETH MOST SWEETLY THE SOUL MOST SELF-LOVING IN WHICH ALL THINGS HAVE THEIR CURRENT AND COUNTER-CURRENT THEIR EBB AND THEIR FLOW:--OH HOW COULD THE LOFTIEST SOUL FAIL TO HAVE THE WORST PARASITES
FUNDAMENTALLY EVERYTHING STANDETH STILL BUT SOON THE SPRING COMETH AND WITH IT THE THAW-WIND
FOR THAT MY BRETHREN THERE IS NEED OF THE LION
DO YE NOT SEE IT THE RAINBOW AND THE BRIDGES OF THE SUPERMAN THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
FOR THEY SAW THAT ALL THEY HAD BROUGHT HOME DURING THE DAY WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO FILL THE ONE SOOTHSAYER LIKEWISE PERISHING OF THIRST CONTINUED THE SOOTHSAYER
I LOVE HIM WHO IS OF A FREE SPIRIT AND A FREE HEART
WHY SO HARD!"--SAID TO THE DIAMOND ONE DAY THE CHARCOAL
VERILY LAUGHTER ITSELF HAST THOU SPREAD OUT OVER US LIKE A MANY-HUED CANOPY
NO SHEPHERD AND ONE HERD
KEEP YOURSELVES UP BETIMES MY BRETHREN LEARN TO KEEP YOURSELVES UP
BUT WHEN HE HEARD ZARATHUSTRA LAUGH HE LOOKED UP WITH CURIOSITY AND SAID SLOWLY
OH MY BRETHREN IS NOT EVERYTHING AT PRESENT IN FLUX
THE COURAGE WHICH SCARETH AWAY GHOSTS CREATETH FOR ITSELF GOBLINS--IT WANTETH TO LAUGH
AND WHEN YE ARE CURSED IT PLEASETH ME NOT THAT YE SHOULD THEN DESIRE TO BLESS
YE SAY IT IS THE GOOD CAUSE WHICH HALLOWETH EVEN WAR
AND WHAT IS MINE IN MY CAVE BELONGETH ALSO UNTO THEE MY GUEST
WHERE IS MY HOME ZARATHUSTRA REALISES THE DANGER THREATENING SUCH A MAN
THEN MAKETH SHE EVERY SACRIFICE AND EVERYTHING ELSE SHE REGARDETH AS WORTHLESS
THE WANDERER
THE WANDERER
HOW COULD THEY ALWAYS DO SO--FOR ONCE ONLY
TAKE HEED LEST A STATUE CRUSH YOU
THE PURPOSE IS ALWAYS THE CHILD
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA SPAKE THESE SAYINGS HE STOOD NIGH TO THE ENTRANCE OF HIS CAVE
VERILY WITH OTHER EYES MY BRETHREN SHALL I THEN SEEK MY LOST ONES
VERILY WITH OTHER EYES MY BRETHREN SHALL I THEN SEEK MY LOST ONES
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD HE LEFT HIS HOME AND THE LAKE OF HIS HOME AND WENT INTO THE MOUNTAINS
THESE ARE ALL STABLE COMETH HOWEVER THE HARD WINTER THE STREAM-TAMER THEN LEARN EVEN THE WITTIEST DISTRUST AND VERILY NOT ONLY THE SIMPLETONS THEN SAY
AND THE SMALLEST GAP HATH FINALLY TO BE BRIDGED OVER
THUS DO I LIE BEND MYSELF TWIST MYSELF CONVULSED WITH ALL ETERNAL TORTURE AND SMITTEN BY THEE CRUELLEST HUNTSMAN THOU UNFAMILIAR--GOD
WHAT MATTER ABOUT LONG LIFE
BUT IT IS MEANT TO BE A POSSIBILITY WHICH MEN OF THE PRESENT COULD REALISE WITH ALL THEIR SPIRITUAL AND PHYSICAL ENERGIES PROVIDED THEY ADOPTED THE NEW VALUES
THAT CALLED YE WILL TO TRUTH YE FAMOUS WISE ONES
WHAT SHALL HE BE CALLED BY US AND LIKE ME DID YE GIVE YOURSELVES QUESTIONS FOR ANSWERS
AN ICE-CAVE TO THEIR BODIES WOULD OUR HAPPINESS BE AND TO THEIR SPIRITS
WITH A HUNDRED-FACED MIRROR DID I CATCH ITS GLANCE WHEN ITS MOUTH WAS SHUT SO THAT ITS EYE MIGHT SPEAK UNTO ME
THESE CHILDREN THIS LIVING PLANTATION THESE LIFE-TREES OF MY WILL AND OF MY HIGHEST HOPE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND STOPPED SUDDENLY IN HIS DISCOURSE
TO BE SURE HE WHO NEVER LIVETH AT THE RIGHT TIME HOW COULD HE EVER DIE AT THE RIGHT TIME
THOU SHALT BITE OUT A TOOTH UPON IT
TAKE CARE
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS HE PAUSED LIKE ONE WHO HAD NOT SAID HIS LAST WORD
BUT PRAY TELL ME MY BRETHREN IF THE GOAL OF HUMANITY BE STILL LACKING IS THERE NOT ALSO STILL LACKING--HUMANITY ITSELF THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
BUT I SUFFER AND HAVE SUFFERED WITH THEM
HOW IT HEARKENETH THIS BLESSED STILLNESS
FOR THEY RETREAT HORROR-STRICKEN INTO THE CAVE WHEN THE LION SPRINGS AT THEM
BUT MORE FRIGHTFUL EVEN AND MORE HEART-STRANGLING WAS IT WHEN IT AGAIN BECAME SILENT AND STILL ALL AROUND AND I ALONE SAT IN THAT MALIGNANT SILENCE
AND OTHERS ARE THERE WHO ARE DRAWN DOWNWARDS
THEN DID YE FIND ME
THIS IS A FINAL PAEAN WHICH ZARATHUSTRA SINGS TO ETERNITY AND THE MARRIAGE-RING OF RINGS THE RING OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE
TARES WANT TO BE CALLED WHEAT
NOW ART THOU AGAIN BEHIND ME:--MY GREATEST DANGER LIETH BEHIND ME
THOUGH HOWEVER I DOUBT ABOUT IT WITH THIS COME I OUT OF OLD-EUROPE THAT DOUBT'TH MORE EAGERLY THAN DOTH ANY ELDERLY MARRIED WOMAN
WHEN HE WAS JUST MIDWAY ACROSS THE LITTLE DOOR OPENED ONCE MORE AND A GAUDILY-DRESSED FELLOW LIKE A BUFFOON SPRANG OUT AND WENT RAPIDLY AFTER THE FIRST ONE
IT WOULD EVEN BE POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER ALL ZARATHUSTRA AS A MUSICAL COMPOSITION
THOU STIRREST STRETCHEST THYSELF WHEEZEST
AND NOT ALL PERHAPS MIGHT I POUR INTO THY RIGOROUS EAR
FOR EVER AWAY
WHAT MATTER ABOUT BLOOD IT SAID
THIS HOWEVER WAS THE BEGINNING OF THAT LONG REPAST WHICH IS CALLED THE SUPPER IN THE HISTORY-BOOKS
I AM ALONE ONE DAY WILT THOU SEE NO LONGER THY LOFTINESS AND SEE TOO CLOSELY THY LOWLINESS
YOUR WAR SHALL YE WAGE AND FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR THOUGHTS
BUT THE MOON STILL REVOLVETH AROUND ALL THAT IS EARTHLY
THUS HE DISCOVERED THE GOOD AND BAD OF MANY PEOPLES
HE BY NO MEANS REGARDED MAN AS THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE BEING WHICH EVOLUTION COULD ARRIVE AT
AH MY HARDEST PATH MUST I ASCEND
AND VERILY THOU CHOOSEST THE HOUR WELL
BUT THE GREATER THING--IN WHICH THOU ART UNWILLING TO BELIEVE--IS THY BODY WITH ITS BIG SAGACITY
BUT IT IS WONDERFULLY APT
TO HIM DO WE CONVEY THIS ASS
BUT FOR WAITING YE HAVE NOT ENOUGH OF CAPACITY IN YOU--NOR EVEN FOR IDLING
WINTER A BAD GUEST SITTETH WITH ME AT HOME
SUCH A FOOL ONE WOULD HAVE TO MUZZLE
TO LIVE--THAT IS TO BURN ONESELF AND YET NOT GET WARM SUCH ANCIENT BABBLING STILL PASSETH FOR WISDOM
THUS DID I COME UNTO YOU YE PRESENT-DAY MEN AND INTO THE LAND OF CULTURE
MINE EGO IS SOMETHING WHICH IS TO BE SURPASSED
WISDOM WEARIETH NOTHING IS WORTH WHILE
ONLY IN THE DANCE DO I KNOW HOW TO SPEAK THE PARABLE OF THE HIGHEST THINGS:--AND NOW HATH MY GRANDEST PARABLE REMAINED UNSPOKEN IN MY LIMBS
TO DISCERN
AH IF I WERE ON MY GUARD AGAINST MAN HOW COULD MAN BE AN ANCHOR TO MY BALL
LITTLE PRUDENCE IS THEREIN AND THE LEAST EVERYDAY WISDOM
WE SHALL GO ASTRAY!--HALT
BUT YOUR HEART IS TRUE AND I LOVE THE BASHFULNESS OF YOUR GOODWILL
THAT TIME DOTH NOT RUN BACKWARD--THAT IS ITS ANIMOSITY
YONDER WHERE THE STORMS RUSH DOWN INTO THE SEA AND THE SNOUT OF THE MOUNTAIN DRINKETH WATER SHALL EACH ON A TIME HAVE HIS DAY AND NIGHT WATCHES FOR HIS TESTING AND RECOGNITION
BUT WHY DO I WONDER
IN APHORISM 20 OF THE ANTICHRIST HE COMPARES IT EXHAUSTIVELY WITH CHRISTIANITY AND THE RESULT OF HIS INVESTIGATION IS VERY MUCH IN FAVOUR OF THE OLDER RELIGION
OPEN YOUR WITS
AND WHERE THERE WAS SUFFERING IT WAS CLAIMED THERE WAS ALWAYS PENALTY
ZARATHUSTRA NOW MEETS THE LAST POPE AND IN A POETICAL FORM WE GET NIETZSCHE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE COURSE JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY PURSUED BEFORE THEY REACHED THEIR FINAL BREAK-UP IN ATHEISM AGNOSTICISM AND THE LIKE
AT THE GATE OF THE TOWN THE GRAVE-DIGGERS MET HIM
THOU ABYSS OF LIGHT!--INTO ALL ABYSSES DO I THEN CARRY MY BENEFICENT YEA-SAYING
BE SHY IN ACCEPTING
AND OFT HAVE I DREAMT THAT STEALING MUST BE MORE BLESSED THAN RECEIVING
THERE IS LACKING THE ONE GOAL
HE--LOVETH HIS ENEMIES
BUT STILL DO I LACK MY PROPER MEN THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
A HEART WEARY AND FLIPPANT
THE JUST HOWEVER ARE FERVOUR AND FUEL THE HOUR WHEN YE SAY
AND THE PEASANT TYPE SHOULD BE MASTER
VI
VI
IT PERSUADETH ME I KNOW NOT HOW IT TOUCHETH ME INWARDLY WITH A CARESSING HAND IT CONSTRAINETH ME
THIRST IN THE CREATING ONE ARROW AND LONGING FOR THE SUPERMAN
THAT HOWEVER,--IS MY TASTE
SECOND PART
SECOND PART
SO THAT ZARATHUSTRA AT LAST LAY AMONG YELLOW AND RED BERRIES GRAPES ROSY APPLES SWEET-SMELLING HERBAGE AND PINE-CONES
TO SEND THE VIRTUES THEMSELVES TO SLEEP AT THE RIGHT TIME
WAS IT NOT THE WORD OF HIM WHO SAID
WAS IT NOT THE WORD OF HIM WHO SAID
BUT AFTERWARDS COMING BACK TO THE SITUATION HE GRASPED THE HAND OF THE MAGICIAN AND SAID FULL OF POLITENESS AND POLICY
BACKWARD THEY ALWAYS GAZE TOWARD DARK AGES
NINE
HENCE THE MISTAKES WHICH HAVE ARISEN IN REGARD TO CONFOUNDING NIETZSCHE WITH HIS EXTREME OPPOSITES THE ANARCHISTS AND AGITATORS
AND THOUGH THOU WERT OF THE RACE OF THE HOT-TEMPERED OR OF THE VOLUPTUOUS OR OF THE FANATICAL OR THE VINDICTIVE
WITH YOUR LOVE SHALL YE ASSAIL HIM WHO INSPIRETH YOU WITH FEAR
THERE FORGETTING AND PASSING-BY ARE THE BEST WISDOM
THERE IS NO DEVIL AND NO HELL
AND TOWARDS ME WAVED THY FLEEING FLYING TRESSES ROUND
AND THAT I TESTIFY SO MUCH IS STILL NOT ENOUGH FOR ME
YE ARE FRIGHTENED
YE ARE FRIGHTENED
THERE ARE THOSE WHO PREACH MY DOCTRINE OF LIFE HE SAYS OF THE NIETZSCHEAN SOCIALISTS AND ARE AT THE SAME TIME PREACHERS OF EQUALITY AND TARANTULAS SEE NOTES ON CHAPTER XL
AND OFT HAVE I LONGED TO PIN THEM FAST WITH THE JAGGED GOLD-WIRES OF LIGHTNING THAT I MIGHT LIKE THE THUNDER BEAT THE DRUM UPON THEIR KETTLE-BELLIES AN ANGRY DRUMMER BECAUSE THEY ROB ME OF THY YEA AND AMEN!--THOU HEAVEN ABOVE ME THOU PURE THOU LUMINOUS HEAVEN
THE DESTROYER OF MORALITY THE GOOD AND JUST CALL ME
SHAMELESS ONE
YE HAVE NOT GONE DEEP ENOUGH INTO THIS SOUL
FOR THEIR SAKE IS THE EARTH TO BE LOVED
OR PERHAPS EVEN GNAWED AWAY NIBBLED BADLY MOST WRETCHED WOEFUL
NEVER MIND
MY BROTHER ARE WAR AND BATTLE EVIL
FOR THERE THE TRUTH IS WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE
O ZARATHUSTRA FAR INDEED THREWEST THOU THY STONE--BUT UPON THYSELF WILL IT RECOIL THEN WAS THE DWARF SILENT
A LITTLE OLDER A LITTLE COLDER
WHAT STRONG ERROR HATH FOUGHT FOR IT BE ON YOUR GUARD ALSO AGAINST THE LEARNED
NOT BECAUSE WE ARE WONT TO LIVE BUT BECAUSE WE ARE WONT TO LOVE
AND SO TARRY I STILL A LITTLE WHILE ON THE EARTH--PARDON ME FOR IT
NOTHING IS MORE REVENGEFUL THAN THEIR MEEKNESS
WHEREFORE
BUT THE OLD MAGICIAN KEPT SILENCE FOR A WHILE
BAD ENEMIES ARE THEY
A HIGHER BODY SHALT THOU CREATE A FIRST MOVEMENT A SPONTANEOUSLY ROLLING WHEEL--A CREATING ONE SHALT THOU CREATE
IN THE LAST VERSE HERE ANOTHER SHAFT OF LIGHT IS THROWN UPON THE IMMACULATE PERCEPTION OR SO-CALLED PURE OBJECTIVITY OF THE SCIENTIFIC MIND
WITH WARM FEET AND WARM THOUGHTS DO I RUN WHERE THE WIND IS CALM--TO THE SUNNY CORNER OF MINE OLIVE-MOUNT
ALL OF THEM THOUGHT THEY HAD LONG KNOWN WHAT WAS GOOD AND BAD FOR MEN
SOMETHING HIGHER THAN ALL RECONCILIATION MUST THE WILL WILL WHICH IS THE WILL TO POWER
WHILE THE WORKS OF DEUSSEN RAOUL RICHTER AND BARONESS ISABELLE VON UNGER-STERNBERG WILL BE FOUND TO THROW USEFUL AND NECESSARY LIGHT UPON MANY QUESTIONS WHICH IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR A SISTER TO TOUCH UPON
NOBLE THOU FEELEST THYSELF STILL AND NOBLE OTHERS ALSO FEEL THEE STILL THOUGH THEY BEAR THEE A GRUDGE AND CAST EVIL LOOKS
AND THAT I MAY ALSO MAINTAIN THE RIGHT HEAR THE STORY OF ANOTHER FIRE-DOG
DARE ONLY TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELVES--IN YOURSELVES AND IN YOUR INWARD PARTS
THOU OUTCAST WHO HAST CAST THYSELF OUT THOU WILT NOT LIVE AMONGST MEN AND MEN'S PITY
IN SOOTH FOR A DOG OF THE DEPTH THOU TAKEST THY NOURISHMENT TOO MUCH FROM THE SURFACE
THE CRUEL TORTURE RESERVED FOR THE CRUELLEST THEMSELVES
CERTAINLY ONE FINDETH PEARLS IN THEM
IN WOMAN'S LOVE THERE IS INJUSTICE AND BLINDNESS TO ALL SHE DOTH NOT LOVE
I KNOW THE HATRED AND ENVY OF YOUR HEARTS
AND FAIN WOULD THEY THEREBY PROVE THEMSELVES RECONCILERS
AND ABOUT THEE THOU UNHAPPY ONE
THE POINT IS THIS THAT A CREATOR OF NEW VALUES MEETS WITH HIS SUREST AND STRONGEST OBSTACLES IN THE VERY SPIRIT OF THE LANGUAGE WHICH IS AT HIS DISPOSAL
THAT IS THE FIRST PERSIAN VIRTUE
FOR THOU SHALT YET BECOME MELLOW AND AGAIN WAS THERE A LAUGHING AND IT FLED
21 IT IS INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THAT THE LAST LINE OF THE DISCOURSE WHICH HAS SO FREQUENTLY BEEN USED BY WOMEN AS A WEAPON AGAINST NIETZSCHE'S VIEWS CONCERNING THEM WAS SUGGESTED TO NIETZSCHE BY A WOMAN SEE DAS LEBEN F
NOT AROUND THE INVENTORS OF NEW NOISE BUT AROUND THE INVENTORS OF NEW VALUES DOTH THE WORLD REVOLVE
NOT AROUND THE INVENTORS OF NEW NOISE BUT AROUND THE INVENTORS OF NEW VALUES DOTH THE WORLD REVOLVE
AM I NOT TRANSFORMED
THE DECLIVITY WHERE THE GAZE SHOOTETH DOWNWARDS AND THE HAND GRASPETH UPWARDS
FOR THE SAKE OF IT WE ARE FORGIVEN FOR LIVING
AND WHEN YE HAVE THAT THEN TAKE THE WHOLE HAND ALSO YEA AND THE HEART WITH IT
AN EARTHLY VIRTUE IS IT WHICH I LOVE
THOU NOW RIDEST BRISKLY UP TO THY GOAL
AND THIS HYPOCRISY FOUND I WORST AMONGST THEM THAT EVEN THOSE WHO COMMAND FEIGN THE VIRTUES OF THOSE WHO SERVE
EVEN GOD HATH HIS HELL
EVEN GOD HATH HIS HELL
ON THE WHOLE WAY HOWEVER HE REJOICED IN HIS HEART AND WAS FULL OF GRATITUDE
COMPANIONS THE CREATOR SEEKETH NOT CORPSES--AND NOT HERDS OR BELIEVERS EITHER
SHE IS A WOMAN AND EVER LOVETH ONLY A WARRIOR
THEREFORE SHALL THEY HAVE IT HARD
AND RUB THE SLEEP AND ALL THE DIMNESS AND BLINDNESS OUT OF THINE EYES
THOU VENERABLE ONE SAID HE THEN WHAT A FINE AND LONG HAND
EVERYTHING DESERVETH TO PERISH ALAS HOW YE STAND THERE BEFORE ME YE UNFRUITFUL ONES
RESISTANCE--THAT IS THE DISTINCTION OF THE SLAVE
THEY PROMOTE SLEEP
SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER XVIII RUNNING ALL THROUGH NIETZSCHE'S WRITINGS
MAN MUST BECOME BETTER AND EVILER"--SO DO I TEACH
TO SMALL VIRTUES WOULD THEY FAIN LURE AND LAUD ME
BECAUSE THEY ATE BADLY
THE IGNORANT TO BE SURE THE PEOPLE--THEY ARE LIKE A RIVER ON WHICH A BOAT FLOATETH ALONG
COURAGE SLAYETH ALSO FELLOW-SUFFERING
ARE NOT WORDS AND TONES RAINBOWS AND SEEMING BRIDGES TWIXT THE ETERNALLY SEPARATED
TO YOUR HONOUR DO I SAY IT
BUT THE DISCIPLE WHOM HE LOVED MOST AROSE QUICKLY SEIZED ZARATHUSTRA'S HAND AND SAID
BUT YE OTHERS WHAT DO I SEE
OH THE VIOLENT HUNGER IN SATIETY
LONG BEFORE HE MET WAGNER HE MUST HAVE IDEALISED HIM IN HIS MIND TO AN EXTENT WHICH ONLY A PROFOUNDLY ARTISTIC NATURE COULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF
DESIRE SPREAD THIS SNARE FOR ME--THE DESIRE FOR LOVE--THAT I SHOULD BECOME THE PREY OF MY CHILDREN AND LOSE MYSELF IN THEM
WHO STILL WANTETH TO RULE ZARATHUSTRA ASKS IN THE PROLOGUE WHO STILL WANTETH TO OBEY
DID NOT A CHILD COME TO ME CARRYING A MIRROR
AND THERE COMETH ALSO MINE
THOU PRAISEST ME REPLIED THE CONSCIENTIOUS ONE IN THAT THOU SEPARATEST ME FROM THYSELF
IT WANTETH TO HAVE FREEDOM
AIR
IN THE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVII
THE MORE HE SEEKETH TO RISE INTO THE HEIGHT AND LIGHT THE MORE VIGOROUSLY DO HIS ROOTS STRUGGLE EARTHWARD DOWNWARD INTO THE DARK AND DEEP--INTO THE EVIL YEA INTO THE EVIL CRIED THE YOUTH
TO THOSE WOULD THEY THEREBY DO INJURY WHO HAVE POWER AT PRESENT
AND ALL MY WANDERING AND MOUNTAIN-CLIMBING
ALTHOUGH HEARD AT A DISTANCE IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE THE CRY OUT OF A SINGLE MOUTH
TO HONOUR FATHER AND MOTHER AND FROM THE ROOT OF THE SOUL TO DO THEIR WILL"--THIS TABLE OF SURMOUNTING HUNG ANOTHER PEOPLE OVER THEM AND BECAME POWERFUL AND PERMANENT THEREBY
THOU LOVEST ME SAITH THE INSOLENT ONE
ONCE HADST THOU PASSIONS AND CALLEDST THEM EVIL
AND WE ARE TO BELIEVE THAT YOUR HEART OVERFLOWETH YE COZENERS
ZARATHUSTRA THEN,--THIS SHADOWY ALLEGORICAL PERSONALITY SPEAKING IN ALLEGORIES AND PARABLES AND AT TIMES NOT EVEN REFRAINING FROM RELATING HIS OWN DREAMS--IS A FIGURE WE CAN UNDERSTAND BUT VERY IMPERFECTLY IF WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF HIS CREATOR AND COUNTERPART FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE
AND YOU YOURSELVES WOULD I BLESS YE TWINKLING STARLETS AND GLOW-WORMS ALOFT!--AND WOULD REJOICE IN THE GIFTS OF YOUR LIGHT
ONE DAY HAD ZARATHUSTRA FALLEN ASLEEP UNDER A FIG-TREE OWING TO THE HEAT WITH HIS ARMS OVER HIS FACE
IT WAS ON THESE TWO ROADS THAT ALL ZARATHUSTRA CAME TO ME ABOVE ALL ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF AS A TYPE;--I OUGHT RATHER TO SAY THAT IT WAS ON THESE WALKS THAT THESE IDEAS WAYLAID ME THE FIRST PART OF ZARATHUSTRA WAS WRITTEN IN ABOUT TEN DAYS--THAT IS TO SAY FROM THE BEGINNING TO ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY 1883
CALL ME HOWEVER WHAT THOU WILT--I AM WHO I MUST BE
THE DEVIL HIMSELF IS PERHAPS--SKIN
VERILY LIKE A STORM COMETH MY HAPPINESS AND MY FREEDOM
THERE ALREADY APPROACHETH EVENTIDE
BUT ART THOU CAPABLE OF IT--TO BE A MURDERER
AND LET ME THANK THEE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
HERE WHERE THE TARANTULA'S DEN IS RISETH ALOFT AN ANCIENT TEMPLE'S RUINS--JUST BEHOLD IT WITH ENLIGHTENED EYES
AND ONLY WHERE THERE ARE GRAVES ARE THERE RESURRECTIONS THUS SANG ZARATHUSTRA
THEN DID I LEARN TO SAY
HERE I THINK I MAY CLAIM THAT MY CONTENTION IN REGARD TO THE PURPOSE AND AIM OF THE WHOLE OF NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY AS STATED AT THE BEGINNING OF MY NOTES ON PART IV IS COMPLETELY UPHELD
THE BODY IS INSPIRED
THE WORLD IS DEEP:--AND DEEPER THAN E'ER THE DAY COULD READ
THOU KNOWEST SURELY THAT NOISE KILLETH THOUGHT,--AND JUST NOW THERE CAME TO ME SUCH DELICATE THOUGHTS
FOR THE AIR HERE OUTSIDE WAS BETTER THAN WITH THE HIGHER MEN
HOW COULD AN ANCHORITE FORGET
6,000 FEET BEYOND MEN AND TIME
AND THY PRIDE WILL NOT EVEN UPBRAID
THEN DO THEY INDICATE THE HOUR WITHOUT MISTAKE AND MAKE A MODEST NOISE THEREBY
20
20
20
BUT INTO FATHERS AND FOREFATHERS OF THE SUPERMAN COULD YE TRANSFORM YOURSELVES
HAVE NOT I MYSELF ALLURED HIM TO ME BY HONEY-OFFERINGS AND ARTFUL LURE-CALLS OF MY HAPPINESS
ONCE ON A TIME ZARATHUSTRA ALSO CAST HIS FANCY BEYOND MAN LIKE ALL BACKWORLDSMEN
FAINTING AND RECOVERING WILL DEMONSTRATE THY POWER OVER THEM
HERE HOWEVER IT HAPPENED THAT THE ASS ALSO FOUND UTTERANCE
FOR HE WAS SORE AT HEART AS HE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE
AND IT SPEAKETH OF THE MEANING OF THE EARTH THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
MANY NOSES WILL HE YET MAKE SNEEZE
END AND LXXI
AS YET HATH HIS KNOWLEDGE NOT LEARNED TO SMILE AND TO BE WITHOUT JEALOUSY
O ZARATHUSTRA SAID HE TO ME I COME TO SEDUCE THEE TO THY LAST SIN TO MY LAST SIN CRIED ZARATHUSTRA AND LAUGHED ANGRILY AT HIS OWN WORDS
THEY SHONE THEIR TORCH ON HIS FACE AND RECOGNISING ZARATHUSTRA THEY SORELY DERIDED HIM
THE IDEA OF REVELATION IN THE SENSE THAT SOMETHING BECOMES SUDDENLY VISIBLE AND AUDIBLE WITH INDESCRIBABLE CERTAINTY AND ACCURACY WHICH PROFOUNDLY CONVULSES AND UPSETS ONE--DESCRIBES SIMPLY THE MATTER OF FACT
HOW ZARATHUSTRA CAME INTO BEING
LIEST THOU NOT IN A SKY-BLUE LAKE OF HAPPINESS?"--"YE WAGS ANSWERED ZARATHUSTRA AND SMILED HOW WELL DID YE CHOOSE THE SIMILE
OF THIS THOU ART THYSELF THE PLEDGE AND THE PROPHET
AND AGAIN DID ZARATHUSTRA'S FEET RUN THROUGH MOUNTAINS AND FORESTS AND HIS EYES SOUGHT AND SOUGHT BUT NOWHERE WAS HE TO BE SEEN WHOM THEY WANTED TO SEE--THE SORELY DISTRESSED SUFFERER AND CRIER
OLD HEART OH HOW COULD I NOT BE ARDENT FOR ETERNITY AND FOR THE MARRIAGE-RING OF RINGS--THE RING OF THE RETURN
AN IDEA MADE THIS PALE MAN PALE
BUT IT IS NOW TOO LATE TO DO SO:--SO YOUR SELF WISHETH TO SUCCUMB YE DESPISERS OF THE BODY
PRECISELY ON THY HEIGHT THOU HIGHER MAN,--THEN WILT THOU STUMBLE
NOW IT DOTH NOT CONCERN ME ANY MORE
THE OLD SOOTHSAYER HOWEVER DANCED WITH DELIGHT
ALL STUPID SHAME FLEETH AWAY
LOOK OUT LOOK OUT MINE EYE
BEGGARS HOWEVER ONE SHOULD ENTIRELY DO AWAY WITH
HE WHO WOULD UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING IN MAN MUST HANDLE EVERYTHING
WHY DOST THOU TEMPT ME ANSWERED THE OTHER
FLEE THITHER WHERE A ROUGH STRONG BREEZE BLOWETH
LOVING AND PERISHING
ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF HOWEVER STUNNED AND STRANGE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT LOOKED AROUND HIM STOOD THERE ASTONISHED INQUIRED OF HIS HEART BETHOUGHT HIMSELF AND REMAINED ALONE
HATH SHE PERHAPS OVERDRUNK HER DRUNKENNESS
ALWAYS MORE ALWAYS BETTER ONES OF YOUR TYPE SHALL SUCCUMB,--FOR YE SHALL ALWAYS HAVE IT WORSE AND HARDER
SO FAR THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT PARAGRAPH
AND VERILY A STATUE HAVE I NOT BECOME NOT YET DO I STAND THERE STIFF STUPID AND STONY LIKE A PILLAR
AND THEY HIT IT
MY BEST-LOVED WICKEDNESS AND ART IS IT THAT MY SILENCE HATH LEARNED NOT TO BETRAY ITSELF BY SILENCE
ONCE BLASPHEMY AGAINST GOD WAS THE GREATEST BLASPHEMY
THEY ARE PETTY GOOD-WOOLED GOOD-WILLED GREY PEOPLE
MY CHILDREN ARE NIGH MY CHILDREN THEN HE BECAME QUITE MUTE
ARCHAIC SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION USAGES HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED
WHAT DID I HEAR SAID HE AT LAST SLOWLY WHAT HAPPENED UNTO ME JUST NOW BUT SOON THERE CAME TO HIM HIS RECOLLECTION AND HE TOOK IN AT A GLANCE ALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY
AND VERILY I AM ASHAMED THAT I HAVE STILL TO BE A POET WHERE ALL BECOMING SEEMED TO ME DANCING OF GODS AND WANTONING OF GODS AND THE WORLD UNLOOSED AND UNBRIDLED AND FLEEING BACK TO ITSELF AS AN ETERNAL SELF-FLEEING AND RE-SEEKING OF ONE ANOTHER OF MANY GODS AS THE BLESSED SELF-CONTRADICTING RECOMMUNING AND REFRATERNISING WITH ONE ANOTHER OF MANY GODS WHERE ALL TIME SEEMED TO ME A BLESSED MOCKERY OF MOMENTS WHERE NECESSITY WAS FREEDOM ITSELF WHICH PLAYED HAPPILY WITH THE GOAD OF FREEDOM WHERE I ALSO FOUND AGAIN MINE OLD DEVIL AND ARCH-ENEMY THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY AND ALL THAT IT CREATED
I LOVE HIM WHO RESERVETH NO SHARE OF SPIRIT FOR HIMSELF BUT WANTETH TO BE WHOLLY THE SPIRIT OF HIS VIRTUE
BAD
BADLY SMELLETH THEIR IDOL TO ME THE COLD MONSTER
FOR HE MUST SUCCUMB THROUGH THE WRATH OF HIS GOD
GO NOT AWAY SAID THEN THE WANDERER WHO CALLED HIMSELF ZARATHUSTRA'S SHADOW ABIDE WITH US--OTHERWISE THE OLD GLOOMY AFFLICTION MIGHT AGAIN FALL UPON US
IMMACULATE PERCEPTION
IMMACULATE PERCEPTION
IMMACULATE PERCEPTION
NOW HOWEVER A NEW TABLE OF VALUATIONS MUST BE PLACED OVER MANKIND--NAMELY THAT OF THE STRONG MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT MAN OVERFLOWING WITH LIFE AND ELEVATED TO HIS ZENITH--THE SUPERMAN WHO IS NOW PUT BEFORE US WITH OVERPOWERING PASSION AS THE AIM OF OUR LIFE HOPE AND WILL
HE WHO CANNOT COMMAND HIMSELF SHALL OBEY
THESE HIGHER MEN ALL OF THEM--DO THEY PERHAPS NOT SMELL WELL
FOR OUR HANDS ARE TOO CLEANLY FOR THAT ROAST
IS THERE NOT EVEN IN ALL LIFE--ROBBING AND SLAYING
BUT I PART FROM THEE
AND EVEN WHEN YE SPEAK OF GOOD AND EVIL AND OF ESTIMATES OF VALUE
AND NOT UNLIKE ONE WHOM AN UNEXPECTED HAPPINESS OVERTAKETH HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND WENT STRAIGHT TOWARDS ZARATHUSTRA
THERE IS NOW NO LONGER ANY EXCUSE FOR MISTAKES WHICH WILL TEND TO BOTCH AND DISFIGURE THE TYPE MAN
AND THUS CAME ITS VOICE UNTO ME
AND AS THE LESSER SURRENDERETH HIMSELF TO THE GREATER THAT HE MAY HAVE DELIGHT AND POWER OVER THE LEAST OF ALL SO DOTH EVEN THE GREATEST SURRENDER HIMSELF AND STAKETH--LIFE FOR THE SAKE OF POWER
THERE STILL LAUGHETH AND WANTONETH MY HIDDEN HAPPINESS
ALSO TO THE GOOD A NOBLE ONE STANDETH IN THE WAY
ONLY FOR MY FRIENDS NOT FOR THE PUBLIC IS WRITTEN IN A PARTICULARLY PERSONAL SPIRIT AND THOSE FEW TO WHOM HE PRESENTED A COPY OF IT HE PLEDGED TO THE STRICTEST SECRECY CONCERNING ITS CONTENTS
MEANWHILE DO I RUN WITH WARM FEET HITHER AND THITHER ON MINE OLIVE-MOUNT
THE SECOND DANCE-SONG
THE SECOND DANCE-SONG
WHICH RIDETH ON EVERY HORSE AND ON EVERY PRIDE
MANY WILL BE REMINDED OF GOOD AND EVIL WHEN THEY LOOK UPON THESE STRUCTURES
SO FAR DO I KNOW THEE
IN PART III WE GET THE SENTIMENTS OF THE DISCOURSE IN THE HAPPY ISLES BUT PERHAPS IN STRONGER TERMS
PROVING IS DIFFICULT TO HIM
AT LAST THE LATTER BEGAN
AND BELIEVE ME FRIEND HULLABALOO
THOU KNOWEST THAT O ZARATHUSTRA
ON EVERY SURFACE HAVE I ALREADY SAT LIKE TIRED DUST HAVE I FALLEN ASLEEP ON MIRRORS AND WINDOW-PANES
MANY LANDS HAVE I SEEN MY NOSE HATH LEARNED TO TEST AND ESTIMATE MANY KINDS OF AIR
CAREFUL HAVE I FOUND ALL BUYERS AND ALL OF THEM HAVE ASTUTE EYES
AND NOT LIKE TIMID BIRDS DID YE COME TO ME AND MY LONGING--NAY BUT AS TRUSTING ONES TO A TRUSTING ONE
MAN'S SOUL HOWEVER IS DEEP ITS CURRENT GUSHETH IN SUBTERRANEAN CAVERNS
DOTH NOTHING GO AGAINST THY CONSCIENCE HERE
FROM THEIR HEIGHT DID I LONG TO BE UP OUT AND AWAY TO THE SUPERMAN
STAY SAID HE AT LAST STAY
THY MUTENESS EVEN IS LIKE TO STRANGLE ME THOU ABYSMAL MUTE ONE
ALIEN TO ME AND A MOCKERY ARE THE PRESENT-DAY MEN TO WHOM OF LATE MY HEART IMPELLED ME
HOW I THANK MY MORNING-DREAM THAT I THUS AT TO-DAY'S DAWN WEIGHED THE WORLD
THEN IS THERE MANY A THING HEARD WHICH MAY NOT BE HEARD BY DAY
CHAPTER LIII
I HAVE DIVINED WHAT AXE IT WAS THAT STRUCK THEE TO THE GROUND
IN YOUR SELF-SEEKING YE CREATING ONES THERE IS THE FORESIGHT AND FORESEEING OF THE PREGNANT
AND SOME OF THEM ARE STILL TOO PUSILLANIMOUS THUS TO CONFESS
AND IN FALLING THE RED SKINS OF THEM BREAK
WHISTLING WHIZZING AND PIERCING IT THREW UNTO ME A BLACK COFFIN
BUT AS A RULE WHEN THE GENERAL DRIFT OF HIS ARGUMENTS IS GRASPED IT REQUIRES BUT A SLIGHT EFFORT OF THE IMAGINATION TO DISCOVER WHOM HE IS REFERRING TO
A REFRESHMENT TO HOT HANDS AND HANDLERS
BECAUSE IT WAS CREATIVE AND ACTIVE
HOW WITH LIGHT AND SHADE THEY STRIVE AGAINST EACH OTHER THE DIVINELY STRIVING ONES THUS STEADFAST AND BEAUTIFUL LET US ALSO BE ENEMIES MY FRIENDS
TOO READILY DOTH THE RECLUSE REACH HIS HAND TO ANY ONE WHO MEETETH HIM
FOR THAT IS THE MODE OF SLAVES
THIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH CHILD AND MARRIAGE IN THE FIFTH VERSE WE SHALL RECOGNISE OUR OLD FRIEND MARRIAGE ON THE TEN-YEARS SYSTEM WHICH GEORGE MEREDITH SUGGESTED SOME YEARS AGO
AND HE WHO LIVETH NIGH UNTO THEM LIVETH NIGH UNTO BLACK POOLS WHEREIN THE TOAD SINGETH HIS SONG WITH SWEET GRAVITY
THOU THYSELF ART GOOD O ZARATHUSTRA AND BETTER EVEN THAN A COW AWAY AWAY WITH THEE
NIETZSCHE HAD THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR BUDDHISM AND ALMOST WHEREVER HE REFERS TO IT IN HIS WORKS IT IS IN TERMS OF PRAISE
COULD I BUT SEE MANY WARRIORS
THE GOD OF THE HOSTS OF WAR IS NOT THE GOD OF THE GOLDEN BAR
MY SKIN IS TOO PURE FOR THY HANDS
AND ON THAT ACCOUNT YE HAD TO DRINK THE BITTER CUP OF YOUR LOVE
IT IS NOT MY CUSTOM TO AWAKE GREAT-GRANDMOTHERS OUT OF THEIR SLEEP THAT I MAY BID THEM--SLEEP ON
NOBLE ENOUGH WAS HE TO DISAVOW
BUT DOUBTER I'M NOW CALLING IT IN QUESTION
GOLD DOTH HIS BREATH EXHALE AND GOLDEN RAIN
TO HIM WENT ZARATHUSTRA AND SAT AMONG THE YOUTHS BEFORE HIS CHAIR
FROM YOU WOULD HE LEARN HIS BELIEF IN HIMSELF
MY IMPATIENT LOVE OVERFLOWETH IN STREAMS,--DOWN TOWARDS SUNRISE AND SUNSET
OUT OF SILENT MOUNTAINS AND STORMS OF AFFLICTION RUSHETH MY SOUL INTO THE VALLEYS
THE ANGELS THEMSELVES MELT INTO TEARS THROUGH THE OVER-GRACIOUSNESS OF THY SMILING
IN YOU YE HIGHER MEN THERE MUST BE MORE OF THAT WHICH THE MAGICIAN CALLETH HIS EVIL SPIRIT OF MAGIC AND DECEIT:--WE MUST INDEED BE DIFFERENT
DO ACCORDING TO MINE EXAMPLE
AND ALSO UNTO WOE DO YE SAY
THE TARANTULAS
THE TARANTULAS
THE TARANTULAS
BUT A HORROR TO US IS THE DEGENERATING SENSE WHICH SAITH
NEIGHBOUR-LOVE
NEIGHBOUR-LOVE
AND YET O MY SOUL LONGETH THY SMILING FOR TEARS AND THY TREMBLING MOUTH FOR SOBS
HERE WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE KIND OF ALTRUISM NIETZSCHE EXACTED FROM HIGHER MEN
FORSOOTH I AM THE GREATEST FOOL TO ALLOW MY COURAGE TO BE SAPPED FROM ME BY THE CLIMATE OF ITALY
HE DISLIKED THE EVIL IT SUGGESTED AND IN RECHRISTENING THE ACT VOLUNTARY DEATH I.E THE DEATH THAT COMES FROM NO OTHER HAND THAN ONE'S OWN HE WAS DESIROUS OF ELEVATING IT TO THE POSITION IT HELD IN CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY SEE APHORISM 36 IN THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS CHAPTER XXII
JUST SEE THESE SUPERFLUOUS ONES
JUST SEE THESE SUPERFLUOUS ONES
WHAT HATH HAPPENED UNTO ME MY FRIENDS
AND WHENCE
VALUATION ITSELF IS THE TREASURE AND JEWEL OF THE VALUED THINGS
TO THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY WILL I SPEAK MY WORD
OR LIFE ETERNAL
AND HE SANK DOWN ALL AT ONCE LIKE AN OAK THAT HATH LONG WITHSTOOD MANY TREE-FELLERS,--HEAVILY SUDDENLY TO THE TERROR EVEN OF THOSE WHO MEANT TO FELL IT
HERE WE MAY STILL BE HOPEFUL
TO LOVE THOSE WHO DESPISE US AND GIVE ONE'S HAND TO THE PHANTOM WHEN IT IS GOING TO FRIGHTEN US
BUT IN THE LONELIEST WILDERNESS HAPPENETH THE SECOND METAMORPHOSIS
TO MANY A ONE MAYEST THOU NOT GIVE THY HAND BUT ONLY THY PAW
SUCH CHAPTERS AS THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR IN THE HAPPY ISLES THE GRAVE-SONG IMMACULATE PERCEPTION THE STILLEST HOUR THE SEVEN SEALS AND MANY OTHERS ARE ALMOST UTTERLY DEVOID OF MEANING TO ALL THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW SOMETHING OF NIETZSCHE'S LIFE HIS AIMS AND HIS FRIENDSHIPS
AND I FLEW AWAY WHEN THE SKELETON OGLED AT ME
AND VERILY I DO NOT EVEN TEACH THAT VIRTUE IS ITS OWN REWARD
IN HIS TEACHING ALONE DO WE MEET WITH TRUTHFULNESS UPHELD AS THE HIGHEST VIRTUE--I.E
ALSO WHAT YE OMIT WEAVETH AT THE WEB OF ALL THE HUMAN FUTURE
I LOVE HIM WHO MAKETH HIS VIRTUE HIS INCLINATION AND DESTINY
ART THOU PURE AIR AND SOLITUDE AND BREAD AND MEDICINE TO THY FRIEND
FOR WHATEVER CAN RUN ITS COURSE OF ALL THINGS ALSO IN THIS LONG LANE OUTWARD--MUST IT ONCE MORE RUN AND THIS SLOW SPIDER WHICH CREEPETH IN THE MOONLIGHT AND THIS MOONLIGHT ITSELF AND THOU AND I IN THIS GATEWAY WHISPERING TOGETHER WHISPERING OF ETERNAL THINGS--MUST WE NOT ALL HAVE ALREADY EXISTED
ALL JOY WANTETH THE ETERNITY OF ALL THINGS IT WANTETH HONEY IT WANTETH LEES IT WANTETH DRUNKEN MIDNIGHT IT WANTETH GRAVES IT WANTETH GRAVE-TEARS CONSOLATION IT WANTETH GILDED EVENING-RED WHAT DOTH NOT JOY WANT
AND WHEN I CALL OUT
IT IS POVERTY AND POLLUTION AND WRETCHED SELF-COMPLACENCY
WHAT THE POPULACE ONCE LEARNED TO BELIEVE WITHOUT REASONS WHO COULD REFUTE IT TO THEM BY MEANS OF REASONS
TO HUMILIATE ONESELF IN ORDER TO MORTIFY ONE'S PRIDE
OR A CHILD THAT HATH BEEN BORN THEE
SPECTATORS SEEKETH THE SPIRIT OF THE POET--SHOULD THEY EVEN BE BUFFALOES BUT OF THIS SPIRIT BECAME I WEARY
AS THE OX OUGHT HE TO DO
AND MANY A ONE WHO HATH COME ALONG AS A DESTROYER AND AS A HAILSTORM TO ALL CORNFIELDS WANTED MERELY TO PUT HIS FOOT INTO THE JAWS OF THE RABBLE AND THUS STOP THEIR THROAT
UNHAPPY DO I CALL ALL THOSE WHO HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE
MUCH OF THE PRISON AND THE MOULD STILL REMAINETH IN HIM
IT IS TIME FOR MAN TO FIX HIS GOAL
BUT AROUND THE ACTORS REVOLVE THE PEOPLE AND THE GLORY
THERE HATH THE TARANTULA BIT ME MYSELF MINE OLD ENEMY
AMONGST SUCH WOULD I NOT BUILD MY TABERNACLE
IN MY OPINION THIS PART IS NIETZSCHE'S OPEN AVOWAL THAT ALL HIS PHILOSOPHY TOGETHER WITH ALL HIS HOPES ENTHUSIASTIC OUTBURSTS BLASPHEMIES PROLIXITIES AND OBSCURITIES WERE MERELY SO MANY GIFTS LAID AT THE FEET OF HIGHER MEN
VERILY IN THEIR SOULS NOT ONLY HONEY IS LACKING
BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN MY SHADOW
TOO COARSELY AND CORDIALLY DO I TALK FOR ANGORA RABBITS
IF HE STRUGGLED UP FROM BARBARISM AND STILL MORE REMOTELY FROM THE LOWER PRIMATES HIS IDEAL SHOULD BE TO SURPASS MAN HIMSELF AND REACH SUPERMAN SEE ESPECIALLY THE PROLOGUE D NIETZSCHE AND SOCIOLOGY
THEY HAVE SOMETHING WHEREOF THEY ARE PROUD
VERILY TO THE LOFTIEST HEIGHT HAD I TO FLY TO FIND AGAIN THE WELL OF DELIGHT
HE LIKENS LIFE UNTO A STREAM
LO I AM A HERALD OF THE LIGHTNING AND A HEAVY DROP OUT OF THE CLOUD
THUS COMETH ITS ASSUAGEMENT
UP NOW
HEAR I PRAY YOU THE DREAM THAT I DREAMED MY FRIENDS AND HELP ME TO DIVINE ITS MEANING
FOR THEE WHOSE COLDNESS INFLAMETH WHOSE HATRED MISLEADETH WHOSE FLIGHT ENCHAINETH WHOSE MOCKERY--PLEADETH
BUT WHAT CAN I DO WITH REGARD TO ITS TRICKS
NO STRONGER ROPES ARE REQUIRED THERE
BUT BEHOLD IT CAME ABOUT OTHERWISE
BAD AIR IS ALWAYS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR REPASTS
I--SEEK ONLY
NOT FOR YOU DO I WAIT HERE IN THESE MOUNTAINS
WHAT IS GOOD
WHAT IS GOOD
DOTH NOT THE MOON MAKE US DRUNKEN YE HIGHER MEN FREE THE SEPULCHRES AWAKEN THE CORPSES
ONLY WHERE THERE IS LIFE IS THERE ALSO WILL
MANY SHORT FOLLIES--THAT IS CALLED LOVE BY YOU
I LOATHE ALSO THIS GREAT CITY AND NOT ONLY THIS FOOL
THOU LIVEST STILL ZARATHUSTRA
IT BOOMETH BY NIGHT UP TO THY CAVE WHEN THOU HEAREST THIS CLOCK STRIKE THE HOURS AT MIDNIGHT THEN THINKEST THOU BETWEEN ONE AND TWELVE THEREON THOU THINKEST THEREON O ZARATHUSTRA I KNOW IT--OF SOON LEAVING ME YEA ANSWERED I HESITATINGLY BUT THOU KNOWEST IT ALSO"--AND I SAID SOMETHING INTO HER EAR IN AMONGST HER CONFUSED YELLOW FOOLISH TRESSES
COMPANIONS THE CREATOR SEEKETH AND SUCH AS KNOW HOW TO WHET THEIR SICKLES
THAT KIND OF THING BELONGETH TO MINE ART
AND THE EARTH IS FULL OF THOSE TO WHOM DESISTANCE FROM LIFE MUST BE PREACHED
THESE ARE SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE DISCOURSE BACKWORLD'S-MEN PAR
BUT ONE MUST KNOW HOW TO BE A SPONGE IF ONE WOULD BE LOVED BY OVERFLOWING HEARTS
AND EVEN WHEN THEY CALL HIM A GOOD MAN THEY WANT THEREBY TO PUT HIM ASIDE
HIS ANIMALS HOWEVER DID NOT LEAVE HIM DAY NOR NIGHT EXCEPT THAT THE EAGLE FLEW FORTH TO FETCH FOOD
BOTH ARE TOO BURDENSOME
BOTH ARE TOO BURDENSOME
MY PLAYMATES TOOK YE FROM ME THE BLESSED SPIRITS
BUT EVEN THOSE SWEET AND SAD POISONS THEY BORROWED FROM THE BODY AND THE EARTH
AND I SEE THE TIME COMING WHEN IT WILL BECOME WEARY OF ITSELF
AT A TIME WHEN INDIVIDUALITY IS SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWN MOST TELLINGLY BY PUTTING BOOTS ON ONE'S HANDS AND GLOVES ON ONE'S FEET IT IS SOMEWHAT REFRESHING TO COME ACROSS A TRUE INDIVIDUALIST WHO FEELS THE CHASM BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS SO DEEPLY THAT HE MUST PERFORCE ADAPT HIMSELF TO THEM OUTWARDLY AT LEAST IN ALL RESPECTS SO THAT THE INNER DIFFERENCE SHOULD BE OVERLOOKED
AND IN TRUTH THIS IMMENSE EAR WAS PERCHED ON A SMALL THIN STALK--THE STALK HOWEVER WAS A MAN
INNOCENT IS IT AS A LITTLE CHILD HOW COULD THEY ENDURE MY HAPPINESS IF I DID NOT PUT AROUND IT ACCIDENTS AND WINTER-PRIVATIONS AND BEAR-SKIN CAPS AND ENMANTLING SNOWFLAKES
YOUR VERY SPARINGNESS IN SIN CRIETH UNTO HEAVEN
ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF HOWEVER LED THE UGLIEST MAN BY THE HAND THAT HE MIGHT SHOW HIM HIS NIGHT-WORLD AND THE GREAT ROUND MOON AND THE SILVERY WATER-FALLS NEAR HIS CAVE
TO BE SURE YE SAY
AND HE WAITED FOR HIS MISFORTUNE THE WHOLE NIGHT
IN THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY HE ACTUALLY CRIES:--"NEITHER A GOOD NOR A BAD TASTE BUT MY TASTE OF WHICH I HAVE NO LONGER EITHER SHAME OR SECRECY CHAPTER XXXVI
BUT WONDER UPON WONDER
O WILL THOU CHANGE OF EVERY NEED MY NEEDFULNESS
NOT LIKE THEM HAVE I GOT THE KNACK OF INVESTIGATING AS THE KNACK OF NUT-CRACKING
ONE GIVETH BIRTH NOT BECAUSE IT GIVETH PLEASURE
END I SPEAK OF NIETZSCHE'S ELEVATION OF THE VIRTUE COURAGE TO THE HIGHEST PLACE AMONG THE VIRTUES
HIS PITY MUST BE FOILED
COMPANIONS DID THE CREATING ONE ONCE SEEK AND CHILDREN OF HIS HOPE
THEN DID HIS ANIMALS THINK THE TIME HAD COME TO SPEAK UNTO HIM
INVENTORS OF FIGURES AND PHANTOMS SHALL THEY BE IN THEIR HOSTILITIES
HIS HEART HOWEVER CAUSETH HIS DOWN-GOING
SHARED INJUSTICE IS HALF JUSTICE
AND JUST THE SAME SHALL MAN BE TO THE SUPERMAN
ALL SUFFERERS SHALL BE PHYSICIANS UNTO ME
THERE IS MUCH APPOINTABLE APPOINTED VIRTUE MUCH APPOINTABLE VIRTUE WITH SCRIBE-FINGERS AND HARDY SITTING-FLESH AND WAITING-FLESH BLESSED WITH SMALL BREAST-STARS AND PADDED HAUNCHLESS DAUGHTERS
TWO KINGS CROSS HIS PATH
A GOOD ROGUISH THING IS ALSO THE LONG SILENCE AND TO LOOK LIKE THE WINTER-SKY OUT OF A CLEAR ROUND-EYED COUNTENANCE LIKE IT TO STIFLE ONE'S SUN AND ONE'S INFLEXIBLE SOLAR WILL
NOT BY ONE LADDER DID I MOUNT TO THE HEIGHT WHERE MINE EYE ROVETH INTO MY REMOTENESS
AN EXCELLENT GUEST'S-PRESENT
IF EVER MY HAND HATH MINGLED THE FURTHEST WITH THE NEAREST FIRE WITH SPIRIT JOY WITH SORROW AND THE HARSHEST WITH THE KINDEST
SEE JUST HOW IT ENTICETH THEM TO IT THE MANY-TOO-MANY
WHEN HOWEVER HE WAS FOUR DAY-JOURNEYS FROM THE HAPPY ISLES AND FROM HIS FRIENDS THEN HAD HE SURMOUNTED ALL HIS PAIN
OH THAT THEIR BEST IS SO VERY SMALL
WHAT DOTH HE SEEK ON THE HEIGHT
HERE ARE GREAT THOUGHTS SEETHED ALIVE AND BOILED SMALL
I AM JUST--REVENGED WITH THEIR VIRTUES THEY WANT TO SCRATCH OUT THE EYES OF THEIR ENEMIES
THOU BELIEVEDST IN MY DISTRESS WHEN THOU HELDEST MY HEAD WITH BOTH THY HANDS I HEARD THEE LAMENT WE HAVE LOVED HIM TOO LITTLE LOVED HIM TOO LITTLE BECAUSE I SO FAR DECEIVED THEE MY WICKEDNESS REJOICED IN ME THOU MAYEST HAVE DECEIVED SUBTLER ONES THAN I SAID ZARATHUSTRA STERNLY
AND HE BECAME LIKE UNTO THOSE OF WHOM THE SOOTHSAYER HAD SPOKEN VERILY SAID HE UNTO HIS DISCIPLES A LITTLE WHILE AND THERE COMETH THE LONG TWILIGHT
THIS OPENING DISCOURSE IS A PARABLE IN WHICH ZARATHUSTRA DISCLOSES THE MENTAL DEVELOPMENT OF ALL CREATORS OF NEW VALUES
BUT WITH WARRIOR-FOOD WITH CONQUEROR-FOOD
DID I EVER FIND ANYWHERE ON EARTH SUCH GOOD AIR AS WITH THEE IN THY CAVE
AND HE HIMSELF JUST DID NOT LOVE SUFFICIENTLY
WOMEN ESPECIALLY OF COURSE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO DISLIKE THEM BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN RUMOURED THAT HIS VIEWS ARE UNFRIENDLY TO THEMSELVES
WHAT IS THE GREATEST THING YE CAN EXPERIENCE
WORSE EVIL DID YE DO UNTO ME THAN ALL MANSLAUGHTER
BUT THAT WHICH THE MANY-TOO-MANY CALL MARRIAGE THOSE SUPERFLUOUS ONES--AH WHAT SHALL I CALL IT
FROM THE PEOPLE HAVE I COME
AT LAST HE ASKED LIKE ONE WHO HESITATETH IN HIMSELF
HOURLY DO THEY BECOME SMALLER POORER UNFRUITFULLER,--POOR HERBS
LIKE MILLSTONES DO THEY WORK AND LIKE PESTLES
AND NOW DO I KNOW ALSO WHERE HE IS TO BE SOUGHT WHOM I HAVE SOUGHT FOR IN VAIN TO-DAY
BUT ZARATHUSTRA
SHALL I COVET MY NEIGHBOUR'S MAIDSERVANT
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS HE AGAIN LOOKED AT THE PEOPLE AND WAS SILENT
FOR IF THE WORLD BE AS A GLOOMY FOREST OF ANIMALS AND A PLEASURE-GROUND FOR ALL WILD HUNTSMEN IT SEEMETH TO ME RATHER--AND PREFERABLY--A FATHOMLESS RICH SEA
BUT CONTRARY THERETO PREACHETH THE THAWING WIND
FOR WHATEVER HAPPINESS IS STILL ON ITS WAY TWIXT HEAVEN AND EARTH NOW SEEKETH FOR LODGING A LUMINOUS SOUL
THE FROST OF SOLITUDE MAKETH ME TREMBLE
HOW DID I EVER BEAR IT
WHEN THE BLOW CAME IT WAS THEREFORE ALL THE MORE SEVERE
HEARTILY VERILY EVEN WHEN I CREEP INTO BED
BEYOND ALL HEAVENS DID I WANT TO DANCE
THAT I HAVE LIVED SO LONG AMONG THEIR NOISE AND BAD BREATHS
WILLING EMANCIPATETH
WILLING EMANCIPATETH
WILLING EMANCIPATETH
WILLING EMANCIPATETH
CHAPTER LXXVIII
AND THE BLINDNESS OF THE BLIND ONE AND HIS SEEKING AND GROPING SHALL YET TESTIFY TO THE POWER OF THE SUN INTO WHICH HE HATH GAZED,--DID YE KNOW THAT BEFORE
AT THIS THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE SPOKEN OF BUT THE HIGHER MAN
WE HAVE GIVEN NIETZSCHE'S DEFINITION OF LIFE IN THE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVI PAR
INTO THE WELL OF ETERNITY
A FOOL HE WHO REMAINETH ALIVE
IN THE BEST THERE IS STILL SOMETHING TO LOATHE
O ZARATHUSTRA THOU SHALT GO AS A SHADOW OF THAT WHICH IS TO COME
THE FURTHEST ONES ARE THEY WHO PAY FOR YOUR LOVE TO THE NEAR ONES
IF EVER MY SCORN HATH SCATTERED MOULDERED WORDS TO THE WINDS AND IF I HAVE COME LIKE A BESOM TO CROSS-SPIDERS AND AS A CLEANSING WIND TO OLD CHARNEL-HOUSES
HE WHO DOTH NOT BELIEVE IN HIMSELF ALWAYS LIETH
THEREFORE BE ON YOUR GUARD AGAINST THE SMALL ONES
FOR NONE OF THEM WISHED TO RETAIN IT
THUS DO ALL THOSE PRESENT THE HIGHER MEN
AT LAST AFTER SEVEN DAYS ZARATHUSTRA RAISED HIMSELF UPON HIS COUCH TOOK A ROSY APPLE IN HIS HAND SMELT IT AND FOUND ITS SMELL PLEASANT
ON THE TREE OF THE FUTURE BUILD WE OUR NEST
BUT WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED THAT IN ZARATHUSTRA WE NOT ONLY HAVE THE HISTORY OF HIS MOST INTIMATE EXPERIENCES FRIENDSHIPS FEUDS DISAPPOINTMENTS TRIUMPHS AND THE LIKE BUT THAT THE VERY FORM IN WHICH THEY ARE NARRATED IS ONE WHICH TENDS RATHER TO OBSCURE THAN TO THROW LIGHT UPON THEM THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH MEET THE READER WHO STARTS QUITE UNPREPARED WILL BE SEEN TO BE REALLY FORMIDABLE
READY FOR DIVINING FLASHES OF LIGHTNING BLESSED HOWEVER IS HE WHO IS THUS CHARGED
GNARLED AND CROOKED AND WITH FLEXIBLE HARDNESS SHALL IT THEN STAND BY THE SEA A LIVING LIGHTHOUSE OF UNCONQUERABLE LIFE
I DO NOT LIKE EVEN TO INHALE THEIR BREATH
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA ARRIVED AT THE NEAREST TOWN WHICH ADJOINETH THE FOREST HE FOUND MANY PEOPLE ASSEMBLED IN THE MARKET-PLACE
THEN DID I FLY BACKWARDS HOMEWARDS--AND ALWAYS FASTER
IN GOOD SPIRITS AND JOYFUL BECAUSE THIS DAY HATH COME TO AN END
DRIP THY SWEETEST DEW THOU HONEY OF MY HEART
HATH NOT THE WORLD NOW BECOME PERFECT
MANY OF THE PARAGRAPHS WILL BE FOUND TO BE MERELY REMINISCENT OF FORMER DISCOURSES
LOATHSOME VERBAL SWILL DOTH IT VOMIT FORTH!--AND THEY MAKE NEWSPAPERS ALSO OUT OF THIS VERBAL SWILL
THE GENERAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT OF MODERN TIMES IN ITS FRANTIC STRUGGLE TO MITIGATE ALL DIFFERENCES IS NOW INVADING EVEN THE WORLD OF SEX
HOW WOULD YE RISE HIGH IF YOUR FATHERS WILL SHOULD NOT RISE WITH YOU
EVEN WHAT THOU HAST NOW CONFESSED IS NOT NEARLY TRUE ENOUGH NOR FALSE ENOUGH FOR ME
BUT HE SHOULD ALSO REDEEM HIS MONSTERS AND ENIGMAS
I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO GIVE UNTO YOU
PRAISES ON WHAT MAKETH HARDY
CHILD AND MARRIAGE
CHILD AND MARRIAGE
BUT WHAT DOTH IT MATTER YE DICE-PLAYERS
WHICH HOWEVER MOUNTETH ALLURINGLY EVEN TO THE PURE AND LONESOME AND UP TO SELF-SATISFIED ELEVATIONS GLOWING LIKE A LOVE THAT PAINTETH PURPLE FELICITIES ALLURINGLY ON EARTHLY HEAVENS
WHOM DO THEY HATE MOST
WHOM DO THEY HATE MOST
THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN HOWEVER IS WITH THE KINE AND WHY IS IT NOT WITH THE RICH ASKED ZARATHUSTRA TEMPTINGLY WHILE HE KEPT BACK THE KINE WHICH SNIFFED FAMILIARLY AT THE PEACEFUL ONE
A HOLY NAYSAYER WHEN THERE IS NO LONGER TIME FOR YEA
THEREON CAN ONE STAND
IN ONE'S FRIEND ONE SHALL HAVE ONE'S BEST ENEMY
HOW WOULD I SUCK AT THE BREASTS OF LIGHT
EVEN YOUR NAUGHT IS A COBWEB AND A SPIDER THAT LIVETH ON THE BLOOD OF THE FUTURE
TACITUS HISTORIAE V
BEHOLD I AM DISEASE SAITH THE EVIL DEED
THERE IS A GAP TWIXT GIVING AND RECEIVING
WITH THE LAST WORDS HOWEVER HE SLIPPED AWAY FROM HIS GUESTS AND FLED FOR A LITTLE WHILE INTO THE OPEN AIR
NOW THE ORIGINAL THINKER WHO FINDS HIMSELF COMPELLED TO USE THE CURRENT SPEECH OF HIS COUNTRY IN ORDER TO IMPART NEW AND HITHERTO UNTRIED VIEWS TO HIS FELLOWS IMPOSES A TASK UPON THE NATURAL MEANS OF COMMUNICATION WHICH IT IS TOTALLY UNFITTED TO PERFORM,--HENCE THE OBSCURITIES AND PROLIXITIES WHICH ARE SO FREQUENTLY MET WITH IN THE WRITINGS OF ORIGINAL THINKERS
MANY A ONE CANNOT LOOSEN HIS OWN FETTERS BUT IS NEVERTHELESS HIS FRIEND'S EMANCIPATOR
NOW HOWEVER IS HE HIMSELF DEAD THE MOST PIOUS OF MEN THE SAINT IN THE FOREST WHO PRAISED HIS GOD CONSTANTLY WITH SINGING AND MUMBLING
BUT HERE THERE ARE ALSO THE VIRTUOUS
PEOPLE STILL FALL OUT BUT ARE SOON RECONCILED--OTHERWISE IT SPOILETH THEIR STOMACHS
ANSWERED ZARATHUSTRA AND SMILED ONCE MORE HOW WELL DO YE KNOW WHAT HAD TO BE FULFILLED IN SEVEN DAYS AND HOW THAT MONSTER CREPT INTO MY THROAT AND CHOKED ME
WHEN HE THUS SAT HOWEVER WITH A STICK IN HIS HAND TRACING THE SHADOW OF HIS FIGURE ON THE EARTH AND REFLECTING--VERILY
THE CONVALESCENT
THE CONVALESCENT
THE CONVALESCENT
BUT HE LIETH THERE IN HIS OBSTINACY AND PREFERRETH TO LANGUISH A SPAN-BREADTH FROM HIS GOAL TO LANGUISH
NOW I LOVE GOD
BITE AS THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF THE DIFFICULTY
IT IS NECESSARY FOR THAT PURPOSE TO KEEP AWAKE ALL DAY
WHILE STILL IN HIS TEENS HE BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH WAGNER'S MUSIC AND GREW PASSIONATELY FOND OF IT
BUT THIS HATH ITS TIME AND ITS OWN FATE THIS PRECEPT HOWEVER GIVE I UNTO THEE IN PARTING THOU FOOL
AND VERILY THOU HAST WELL DETECTED ME
AND IF THEY REMAINED IN THEIR CHAMBERS WHILST THOU ART ALREADY AWAKE AND COMEST AND BESTOWEST AND DISTRIBUTEST HOW WOULD THY PROUD MODESTY UPBRAID FOR IT
THERE IS BUT ONE GOD
IN THEIR HEARTS THEY WANT SIMPLY ONE THING MOST OF ALL
MANY FINE THINGS HATH ZARATHUSTRA SAID ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE YOUNG ENOUGH FOR THEM
IT IS THE SURRENDER OF THE GREATEST TO RUN RISK AND DANGER AND PLAY DICE FOR DEATH
AND BECAUSE IT REQUIRETH ELEVATION THEREFORE DOTH IT REQUIRE STEPS AND VARIANCE OF STEPS AND CLIMBERS
TWIXT RUGGED ROCKS DID I SUDDENLY STAND ALONE DREARY IN THE DREARIEST MOONLIGHT
WHEN YESTER-EVE THE MOON AROSE THEN DID I FANCY IT ABOUT TO BEAR A SUN
VERSES 20 TO 30 AFFORD AN EXCELLENT SUPPLEMENT TO NIETZSCHE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE NOBLE TYPE TOWARDS THE SLAVES IN APHORISM 260 OF THE WORK BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL SEE ALSO NOTE B CHAPTER LV
FOR THIS IS YOUR TRUTH
SHOULD NOT EVERYTHING--STAND STILL FUNDAMENTALLY STANDETH EVERYTHING STILL"--THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE WINTER DOCTRINE GOOD CHEER FOR AN UNPRODUCTIVE PERIOD A GREAT COMFORT FOR WINTER-SLEEPERS AND FIRESIDE-LOUNGERS
YE VENERATE ME
AND THOUGH IT BE A FOLLY WHAT I HERE SEEK AND DO IT IS BETTER SO THAN THAT DOWN BELOW I SHOULD BECOME SOLEMN WITH WAITING AND GREEN AND YELLOW A POSTURING WRATH-SNORTER WITH WAITING A HOLY HOWL-STORM FROM THE MOUNTAINS AN IMPATIENT ONE THAT SHOUTETH DOWN INTO THE VALLEYS
TO WHAT HEIGHT--WOULD HIS RAPACITY FLY
HERE ALL BEING WANTETH TO BECOME WORDS HERE ALL BECOMING WANTETH TO LEARN OF THEE HOW TO TALK THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE OF INSPIRATION
AND LIKEWISE CONCERNING ALL THE SPOUTING AND SUBVERSIVE DEVILS OF WHICH NOT ONLY OLD WOMEN ARE AFRAID
TO PRICK A SWOLLEN ONE IN THE BELLY I CALL GOOD PASTIME
LO THERE IS NO REQUITAL
ALOFT WILL IT BUILD ITSELF WITH COLUMNS AND STAIRS--LIFE ITSELF
HIS VOICE HOWEVER CAME UNTO HIS DISCIPLES AS FROM AFAR
STUPID DO I THEN STAND LIKE THIS ACADEMIC CHAIR
OVER THE SEA RIDETH IT HITHER THE GOOD RIDER
I LOVE THE GREAT DESPISERS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE GREAT ADORERS AND ARROWS OF LONGING FOR THE OTHER SHORE HE THEREFORE HONOURS THE UGLIEST MAN
INTO REMOTE DISTANCES WOULD IT GAZE AND OUT TOWARDS BLISSFUL BEAUTIES THEREFORE DOTH IT REQUIRE ELEVATION
AND SO THEY PUT WOOD AND EARTH AND RUBBISH BETWIXT ME AND THEIR HEADS
A SMALL LIGHT CERTAINLY BUT A GREAT COMFORT TO CAST-AWAY SAILORS AND SHIP-WRECKED ONES
GOAD FURTHER
SMELL YE IT NOT
LOVING ONES WAS IT ALWAYS AND CREATING ONES THAT CREATED GOOD AND BAD
THOU BAT
ZARATHUSTRA'S EYE HAD PERCEIVED THAT A CERTAIN YOUTH AVOIDED HIM
FIRE OF LOVE GLOWETH IN THE NAMES OF ALL THE VIRTUES AND FIRE OF WRATH
LET IT BE VERY JUSTICE FOR THE WORLD TO BECOME FULL OF THE STORMS OF OUR VENGEANCE"--THUS DO THEY TALK TO ONE ANOTHER
HOW IT BOBBETH THE BLESSED ONE THE HOME-RETURNING ONE IN ITS PURPLE SADDLES
I AM OLD ENOUGH TO FORGET IT PRESENTLY AND I OBLIGED THE OLD WOMAN AND SPAKE THUS UNTO HER
AN UNSTABLE WILL
AND PERHAPS YE WILL FLEE THEREFROM ALONG WITH MINE ENEMIES
O ZARATHUSTRA IT WHISPERED SCORNFULLY SYLLABLE BY SYLLABLE THOU STONE OF WISDOM
AND THUS DOTH IT ROLL STONES OUT OF ANIMOSITY AND ILL-HUMOUR AND TAKETH REVENGE ON WHATEVER DOTH NOT LIKE IT FEEL RAGE AND ILL-HUMOUR
THEY GILD PALM-LEAVES
HE WHO HAD TO CREATE HAD ALWAYS HIS PRESAGING DREAMS AND ASTRAL PREMONITIONS--AND BELIEVED IN BELIEVING SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LXXVII IN THE LAST TWO VERSES HE REVEALS THE NATURE OF HIS ALTRUISM
RATHER DID I QUESTION AND TEST THE WAYS THEMSELVES
IS IT NOT SWEET TO SLEEP--THE SHEPHERD PIPES
THEY DID NOT THINK SUFFICIENTLY INTO THE DEPTH
MUST NOT THIS GATEWAY ALSO--HAVE ALREADY EXISTED
AND WHAT ENJOINETH EVEN THE HIGHEST STILL--TO GROW UPWARDS NOW STAND THE SCALES POISED AND AT REST
WHAT CRIED HE THE MOST IMPORTANT CREATURE ON EARTH
AND VERILY ALTHOUGH A MAN SHOULD GAIN THE WHOLE WORLD AND YET NOT LEARN ONE THING RUMINATING WHAT WOULD IT PROFIT HIM
NEVER DID MINE EYE SEE ANYTHING SO MOTLEY-COLOURED
AH WHITHER HATH THAT JOYOUS WISDOM NOW FLED
FULLY SLEPT HAD THEY MERELY CONCEALED IN CORPSE-CLOTHES
TRUE HE HAS HELPED THEM HE HAS GIVEN THEM BACK WHAT THEY MOST NEED I.E BELIEF IN BELIEVING--THE CONFIDENCE IN HAVING CONFIDENCE IN SOMETHING BUT HOW DO THEY USE IT
OH BREAK THOU HEART
HAVE I CREATED IT AND THE WORLD
WITH ROPE-LADDERS LEARNED I TO REACH MANY A WINDOW WITH NIMBLE LEGS DID I CLIMB HIGH MASTS
HE ATE WELL LOVED WELL PLAYED THE FLUTE WELL AND I BELIEVE HE SMOKED THE BEST CIGARS
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS ALSO SOME METHOD IN MADNESS
HOW CAME GOLD TO THE HIGHEST VALUE
A BOOK FOR ALL AND NONE GENERALLY SUCCEEDS IN DISSIPATING THE LAST DOUBTS THE PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER MAY ENTERTAIN CONCERNING HIS FITNESS FOR THE BOOK OR ITS FITNESS FOR HIM
MOMENT THEN WANTED YE ALL TO COME BACK AGAIN
A TRUTH WHICH ONLY GLIDETH INTO FINE EARS HE CALLETH FALSEHOOD AND TRUMPERY
HUNGER ATTACKETH ME SAID ZARATHUSTRA LIKE A ROBBER
TO DRIVE MAD--THAT MEANETH WITH HIM TO CONVINCE
UPON THINE OWN HEAD AND BEYOND THINE OWN HEART
AH THERE HATH ALWAYS BEEN SO MUCH FLOWN-AWAY VIRTUE
THE SEA STORMETH
THE SEA STORMETH
SUCH ACCUSERS OF LIFE--THEM LIFE OVERCOMETH WITH A GLANCE OF THE EYE
OH SEE ME LYING THOU ARROGANT ONE AND IMPLORING GRACE
AND ALWAYS DID THEY PUT GLASS GLOVES ON THEIR FINGERS IN DOING SO
MAN IS A THING TOO IMPERFECT FOR ME
LOVE WHICH WOULD RULE AND LOVE WHICH WOULD OBEY CREATED FOR THEMSELVES SUCH TABLES
SUCH ROVING ABOUT CHRISTENETH ITSELF BROTHERLY LOVE
THE WORLD WAITETH FOR THEE AS A GARDEN
ALL CREATORS HOWEVER ARE HARD THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
BUT ONE DAY WILL THE SOLITUDE WEARY THEE
TELL ME PRAY
FOR IT DO I BID YOUR SAILS SEARCH AND SEARCH
FOR IN ORDER TO BE REALLY GOOD OR EVIL SOME STRENGTH AND DEEP BREATHING IS REQUIRED
FOR VIRTUE IS THE WILL TO DOWN-GOING AND AN ARROW OF LONGING
ENEMY SHALL YE SAY BUT NOT VILLAIN INVALID SHALL YE SAY BUT NOT WRETCH FOOL SHALL YE SAY BUT NOT SINNER AND THOU RED JUDGE IF THOU WOULD SAY AUDIBLY ALL THOU HAST DONE IN THOUGHT THEN WOULD EVERY ONE CRY
WITH DIFFICULTY DID I GET OUT OF THE CROWD OF THE PITIFUL,--THAT I MIGHT FIND THE ONLY ONE WHO AT PRESENT TEACHETH THAT PITY IS OBTRUSIVE THYSELF O ZARATHUSTRA
BUT IN MY FACE DO I FEEL THROUGH THY HAND TWO SPOTS AND RED BLOTCHES ITCH
AND VERILY IT IS NO COMMANDMENT FOR TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW TO LEARN TO LOVE ONESELF
AND VERILY IT IS NO COMMANDMENT FOR TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW TO LEARN TO LOVE ONESELF
HIS TEACHING HERE IS QUITE CLEAR
A MASS OF DISEASES THAT REACH OUT INTO THE WORLD THROUGH THE SPIRIT
X

THE SECOND ONE HOWEVER WHO DISCOVERED THEIR COUNTRY--THE COUNTRY HEART AND SOIL OF THE GOOD AND JUST,--IT WAS HE WHO ASKED
THY STOMACH WANTETH SOFTER THINGS
SHE HATH HER EYE HER LAUGH AND EVEN HER GOLDEN ANGLE-ROD
BUT IT IS NOT THE DANGER OF THE NOBLE MAN TO TURN A GOOD MAN BUT LEST HE SHOULD BECOME A BLUSTERER A SCOFFER OR A DESTROYER
18
18
A CONQUEROR
VALUES DID MAN ONLY ASSIGN TO THINGS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF--HE CREATED ONLY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THINGS A HUMAN SIGNIFICANCE
AND AS IF THERE WERE A SPECIAL SECRET ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE WHICH CHOKETH UP FOR THOSE WHO LEARN ANYTHING SO DO WE BELIEVE IN THE PEOPLE AND IN THEIR WISDOM THIS HOWEVER DO ALL POETS BELIEVE
SLEEP TAPPETH ON MINE EYE AND IT TURNETH HEAVY
MOREOVER YE ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY BEAUTIFUL AND WELL-BORN FOR ME
BUT BID THY COMPANION EAT AND DRINK ALSO HE IS WEARIER THAN THOU ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED
NOTHING IS WORTH WHILE
VERILY IT SEEMETH TO ME THOU ART A FOOL OR ELSE I MYSELF AM ONE
OH THAT THEIR WORST IS SO VERY SMALL

HATH NOT THE WORLD JUST NOW BECOME PERFECT
HATH NOT THE WORLD JUST NOW BECOME PERFECT
WHETHER MY BROTHER WOULD EVER HAVE WRITTEN THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA ACCORDING TO THE FIRST PLAN SKETCHED IN THE SUMMER OF 1881 IF HE HAD NOT HAD THE DISAPPOINTMENTS ALREADY REFERRED TO IS NOW AN IDLE QUESTION
ONCE DID ONE BELIEVE IN SOOTHSAYERS AND ASTROLOGERS
GLADLY FORSOOTH WOULD I CONDUCT THEE THITHER MYSELF THOU VENERABLE ONE
SOMBRE IS HUMAN LIFE AND AS YET WITHOUT MEANING
O ZARATHUSTRA SAID THEY GAZEST THOU OUT PERHAPS FOR THY HAPPINESS?"--"OF WHAT ACCOUNT IS MY HAPPINESS ANSWERED HE I HAVE LONG CEASED TO STRIVE ANY MORE FOR HAPPINESS I STRIVE FOR MY WORK."--"O ZARATHUSTRA SAID THE ANIMALS ONCE MORE THAT SAYEST THOU AS ONE WHO HATH OVERMUCH OF GOOD THINGS
BUT FOR A TREE TO BECOME GREAT IT SEEKETH TO TWINE HARD ROOTS AROUND HARD ROCKS
ALSO HIS HERO-WILL HATH HE STILL TO UNLEARN
BUT HOW COULD I BE JUST FROM THE HEART
ONLY THE FETTER FOR THE THOUSAND NECKS IS STILL LACKING
FOR IN THE FORMER OF THESE DISCOURSES WE MEET WITH WHAT NIETZSCHE REGARDED AS THE CROWNING DOCTRINE OF HIS PHILOSOPHY AND IN THE OLD AND NEW TABLES WE HAVE A VALUABLE EPITOME OF PRACTICALLY ALL HIS LEADING PRINCIPLES
THEREFORE HEARKEN THEY TO THE PREACHERS OF DEATH AND THEMSELVES PREACH BACKWORLDS
HIS REASONS HOWEVER FOR CHOOSING ZARATHUSTRA OF ALL OTHERS TO BE HIS MOUTHPIECE HE GIVES US IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS:--"PEOPLE HAVE NEVER ASKED ME AS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE WHAT THE NAME ZARATHUSTRA PRECISELY MEANS IN MY MOUTH IN THE MOUTH OF THE FIRST IMMORALIST
THEN LAID HE HIS FINGER ON HIS MOUTH AND SAID
ART THOU ANGRY WITH ME BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY RACKED LANGUAGE TOO LONG
IT IS AWAY
IS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THE MOTHER OF ALL TRAGEDIES
MOST READERS WILL BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE FACTS RELATING TO NIETZSCHE'S AND WAGNER'S FRIENDSHIP AND ULTIMATE SEPARATION
17 PAR
MANY OF THEM HAVE SUFFERED TOO MUCH
O ZARATHUSTRA BY THE WAY IN WHICH THOU HAST GIVEN US THY HAND AND THY GREETING WE RECOGNISE THEE AS ZARATHUSTRA
PART I
AND VERILY THERE ARE MANY EVIL BEASTS ABOUT ME WITH THOSE WORDS ZARATHUSTRA TURNED AROUND TO DEPART
ALAS SAID HE TO HIS HEART THERE SITTETH DISGUISED AFFLICTION
AND IF THERE COME UNTO THEM TENDER EMOTIONS THEN DO THE POETS ALWAYS THINK THAT NATURE HERSELF IS IN LOVE WITH THEM
I ASCENDED I ASCENDED I DREAMT I THOUGHT,--BUT EVERYTHING OPPRESSED ME
THAT I SPAKE OF SACRIFICES AND HONEY-SACRIFICES IT WAS MERELY A RUSE IN TALKING AND VERILY A USEFUL FOLLY
A BESTOWING VIRTUE IS THE HIGHEST VIRTUE
THE SEVEN SEALS
THE SEVEN SEALS
THE SEVEN SEALS
THE PUREST ARE TO BE MASTERS OF THE WORLD THE LEAST KNOWN THE STRONGEST THE MIDNIGHT-SOULS WHO ARE BRIGHTER AND DEEPER THAN ANY DAY
IN THE MEANTIME THE ASSEMBLED ONES HAD RISEN FROM THEIR SEATS AND WAITED WITH REVERENCE FOR ZARATHUSTRA TO SPEAK
14 15 16 17
THY LIFE ITSELF INTERPRETETH UNTO US THIS DREAM O ZARATHUSTRA
THE EVENING IS IT WHICH THUS INTERROGATETH IN ME
BETTER TO HAVE NO GOD BETTER TO SET UP DESTINY ON ONE'S OWN ACCOUNT BETTER TO BE A FOOL BETTER TO BE GOD ONESELF WHAT DO I HEAR SAID THEN THE OLD POPE WITH INTENT EARS
HE WHO HATH SO MUCH TIME TAKETH HIS TIME
ALL IS ALIKE NOTHING IS WORTH WHILE THE WORLD IS WITHOUT MEANING KNOWLEDGE STRANGLETH BUT HIS FACE HAD CHANGED SINCE THEN
NO GREATER POWER DID ZARATHUSTRA FIND ON EARTH THAN GOOD AND BAD
YEA LIFE IS HARD TO BEAR BUT MAN HIMSELF ONLY IS HARD TO BEAR
LITTLE DOTH WOMAN UNDERSTAND OTHERWISE ABOUT HONOUR
IT IS YOUR TIME YE MIDDAY BRETHREN IN THAT SUMMER OF 1881 MY BROTHER AFTER MANY YEARS OF STEADILY DECLINING HEALTH BEGAN AT LAST TO RALLY AND IT IS TO THIS FIRST GUSH OF THE RECOVERY OF HIS ONCE SPLENDID BODILY CONDITION THAT WE OWE NOT ONLY THE GAY SCIENCE WHICH IN ITS MOOD MAY BE REGARDED AS A PRELUDE TO ZARATHUSTRA BUT ALSO ZARATHUSTRA ITSELF
ZARATHUSTRA IS GODLESS AND ESPECIALLY DO THEIR TEACHERS OF SUBMISSION SHOUT THIS;--BUT PRECISELY IN THEIR EARS DO I LOVE TO CRY
THUS DID THESE ANIMALS DO ALL THIS WENT ON FOR A LONG TIME OR A SHORT TIME
VERILY IT WILL BE MY DEATH YET--TO CHOKE WITH LAUGHTER WHEN I SEE ASSES DRUNKEN AND HEAR NIGHT-WATCHMEN THUS DOUBT ABOUT GOD
OUR FAITH IN OTHERS BETRAYETH WHEREIN WE WOULD FAIN HAVE FAITH IN OURSELVES
AH WHY DOTH THE WORM STILL BURROW
AND BE ON THY GUARD AGAINST THE GOOD AND JUST
OFTEN IT COMETH TO ME ONLY AFTER A REPAST AND ALL DAY IT HATH FAILED TO COME
IS IT NOT FOLLY STILL TO LIVE AH MY FRIENDS
ALREADY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY I HINTED AT THE REASONS WHICH LED MY BROTHER TO SELECT A PERSIAN AS THE INCARNATION OF HIS IDEAL OF THE MAJESTIC PHILOSOPHER
MANY TOO MANY ARE BORN
AND THUS SPAKE THE OLD MAN TO ZARATHUSTRA
THOU WILT NOT ZARATHUSTRA
IN THE END ONE EXPERIENCETH ONLY ONESELF
THE HOUR THAT SAITH UNTO HIM
EVERY ONE WANTETH THE SAME
THUS DIDST THOU WHITEWASH THY LIE BEFORE ME WHEN THOU SAIDST
THE FRIEND
THE FRIEND
OH THOSE GOOD ONES
OH THE SILENCE OF ALL SHINING ONES
THIS TELLS ITS OWN TALE
IT CAN SERVE NO PURPOSE WITH THE ORDINARY MEDIOCRE TYPE OF MAN
THIS IS MINE EMPIRE AND MY DOMINION
EVERY ONE HOWEVER BELIEVETH IN HIS LONG EARS
THE PARASITE IS THE LOWEST SPECIES
THERE IS WISDOM IN THE FACT THAT MUCH IN THE WORLD SMELLETH BADLY
IT SHALL LAUGH BACK TO YOU WITH ITS PURITY
A BY-WAY TO MY PURPOSE
HE WOULD NOT BE RID OF HIS AFFLICTION HIS GREAT AFFLICTION
FOR KNOW THAT WHEN ALOFT I WILL MAKE THE HONEY-SACRIFICE WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER WAS ALOFT ON THE SUMMIT HE SENT HIS ANIMALS HOME THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM AND FOUND THAT HE WAS NOW ALONE:--THEN HE LAUGHED FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART LOOKED AROUND HIM AND SPAKE THUS
THAT WOULD BE THE DEAREST THING TO ME"--THUS DOTH THE SEDUCED ONE SEDUCE HIMSELF,--"TO LOVE THE EARTH AS THE MOON LOVETH IT AND WITH THE EYE ONLY TO FEEL ITS BEAUTY
WHOEVER THOU ART THOU TRAVELLER SAID HE HELP A STRAYED ONE A SEEKER AN OLD MAN WHO MAY HERE EASILY COME TO GRIEF

ZARATHUSTRA IS CARRYING AWAY THE DEAD DOG
TORTUOUSLY DO ALL GOOD THINGS COME NIGH TO THEIR GOAL
BUT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MINE ENEMIES PASS THEM QUIETLY AND WITH SLEEPING SWORDS
A SCHOLAR AM I STILL TO THE CHILDREN AND ALSO TO THE THISTLES AND RED POPPIES
WHO ORDERETH THIS?--AH MINE ANGRY MISTRESS WISHETH IT SO
WE ARE ALL EQUAL YE HIGHER MEN,"--SO BLINKETH THE POPULACE--"THERE ARE NO HIGHER MEN WE ARE ALL EQUAL
THIS--IS NOW MY WAY,--WHERE IS YOURS CHAPTER LVI
ALL YE TO WHOM ROUGH LABOUR IS DEAR AND THE RAPID NEW AND STRANGE--YE PUT UP WITH YOURSELVES BADLY
WITH MY BEST BAIT SHALL I ALLURE TO MYSELF TO-DAY THE STRANGEST HUMAN FISH
I SQUANDER WHAT IS GIVEN ME A SQUANDERER WITH A THOUSAND HANDS
AT PRESENT THAT IS TO SAY WHEN EVERYTHING LOW HATH BECOME REBELLIOUS AND EXCLUSIVE AND HAUGHTY IN ITS MANNER--IN THE MANNER OF THE POPULACE
ASSOCIATION WITH MEN SPOILETH THE CHARACTER ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE HATH NONE THE ONE GOETH TO HIS NEIGHBOUR BECAUSE HE SEEKETH HIMSELF AND THE OTHER BECAUSE HE WOULD FAIN LOSE HIMSELF
NOW HOWEVER IN THE COOL AIR WHEN EVEN ALL THE TUMULT OF YOUR HEARTS HATH BECOME STILL NOW DOTH IT SPEAK NOW IS IT HEARD NOW DOTH IT STEAL INTO OVERWAKEFUL NOCTURNAL SOULS
BUT THIS IS THE SECRET SOLEMN HOUR WHEN NO SHEPHERD PLAYETH HIS PIPE
THIS CONDITION CONTINUED FOR SEVEN DAYS
HERE WE FIND NIETZSCHE CONFRONTED WITH HIS EXTREME OPPOSITE WITH HIM THEREFORE FOR WHOM HE IS MOST FREQUENTLY MISTAKEN BY THE UNWARY
THYSELF THREWEST THOU SO HIGH,--BUT EVERY THROWN STONE--MUST FALL
AND IF MAN SHOULD YET LEARN TO FLY ALAS
JUST SUCH A FATE--WILLETH MY WILL
WELL I DO NOT LIKE IT THAT HEAVEN OF THE SUPERFLUOUS
HATH A SEVENTH-DAY EVENING COME TO IT PRECISELY AT NOONTIDE
THERE ARE PREACHERS OF DEATH
HAVE I NOT CUT THEE
12 WERE DISCUSSED IN THE NOTES ON CHAPTERS XXXVI
I DESPISE THY CONTEMPT
SEE THOU THERETO
THEY EMPTY THEMSELVES
FOR ALL GODS ARE POET-SYMBOLISATIONS POET-SOPHISTICATIONS
MINE UNHAPPINESS MY HAPPINESS IS DEEP THOU STRANGE DAY BUT YET AM I NO GOD NO GOD'S-HELL
BUT THOU PROFOUND ONE THOU SUFFEREST TOO PROFOUNDLY EVEN FROM SMALL WOUNDS
A NEW WILL TEACH I UNTO MEN
BUT ZARATHUSTRA DID NOT HEAR THAT THEY WERE SILENT
IT IS THE TIME OF KINGS NO LONGER
ON THAT ACCOUNT HAVE I COME TO ZARATHUSTRA
THE SHEPHERD HOWEVER BIT AS MY CRY HAD ADMONISHED HIM
UPWARDS:--ALTHOUGH IT SAT UPON ME HALF-DWARF HALF-MOLE
AND MANY A POWERFUL ONE WHO WANTED TO RUN WELL WITH THE PEOPLE HATH HARNESSED IN FRONT OF HIS HORSES--A DONKEY A FAMOUS WISE MAN
VERILY THE CRAFTY EGO THE LOVELESS ONE THAT SEEKETH ITS ADVANTAGE IN THE ADVANTAGE OF MANY--IT IS NOT THE ORIGIN OF THE HERD BUT ITS RUIN
CRUELLEST GOADER
NOW WE KNOW
FIVE WORDS ABOUT OLD THINGS DID I HEAR YESTER-NIGHT AT THE GARDEN-WALL
AND THEREFORE HAVE YE THE THIRST TO ACCUMULATE ALL RICHES IN YOUR SOUL
WHAT HAVE WE IN COMMON WITH THE ROSE-BUD WHICH TREMBLETH BECAUSE A DROP OF DEW HATH FORMED UPON IT
MUST I NOT WEAR STILTS THAT THEY MAY OVERLOOK MY LONG LEGS--ALL THOSE ENVIERS AND INJURERS AROUND ME
MY HAND PULLED AT THE SERPENT AND PULLED:--IN VAIN
TAKE GOOD CARE THERE YE HIGHER MEN
MY SUFFERING AND MY FELLOW-SUFFERING--WHAT MATTER ABOUT THEM
AND YET
MUST NOT WHATEVER CAN RUN ITS COURSE OF ALL THINGS HAVE ALREADY RUN ALONG THAT LANE
IS NOT ALL WEEPING COMPLAINING
YOUR MOST SECRET TYRANT-LONGINGS DISGUISE THEMSELVES THUS IN VIRTUE-WORDS
PUT OUT THEIR EYES
UNLESS IT BE,--UNLESS IT BE DO FORGIVE AN OLD RECOLLECTION
NIETZSCHE IS HERE COMPLETELY IN HIS ELEMENT
SO MUCH KINDNESS SO MUCH WEAKNESS DO I SEE
HOW HAVE I FLOWN TO THE HEIGHT WHERE NO RABBLE ANY LONGER SIT AT THE WELLS
IN IT WE FIND NIETZSCHE FACE TO FACE WITH THE CREATURE HE MOST SINCERELY LOATHES--THE SPIRIT OF REVOLUTION AND WE OBTAIN FRESH HINTS CONCERNING HIS HATRED OF THE ANARCHIST AND REBEL
THEY CLAMBER OVER ONE ANOTHER AND THUS SCUFFLE INTO THE MUD AND THE ABYSS
THIS WORLD THE ETERNALLY IMPERFECT AN ETERNAL CONTRADICTION'S IMAGE AND IMPERFECT IMAGE--AN INTOXICATING JOY TO ITS IMPERFECT CREATOR:--THUS DID THE WORLD ONCE SEEM TO ME
I LOVE ALL WHO ARE LIKE HEAVY DROPS FALLING ONE BY ONE OUT OF THE DARK CLOUD THAT LOWERETH OVER MAN
HE HOWEVER WHO IS OF MY NATURE DOTH NOT AVOID SUCH AN HOUR
WOMAN SURMISETH ITS FORCE BUT COMPREHENDETH IT NOT THEN ANSWERED ME THE OLD WOMAN
THOU WILT ONE DAY CRY
THOU WILT ONE DAY CRY
THEN DID IT BECOME STILL AROUND ME AS WITH A DOUBLE STILLNESS
ALTHOUGH SO ALARMED--I HAD YET TO LAUGH
THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME AN OLD GRIM-BEARD OF A GOD A JEALOUS ONE FORGOT HIMSELF IN SUCH WISE AND ALL THE GODS THEN LAUGHED AND SHOOK UPON THEIR THRONES AND EXCLAIMED
AND LIKE THE STAR THAT GOETH OUT SO IS EVERY WORK OF YOUR VIRTUE
I LOVE THY TONE THY DRUNKEN RANUNCULINE TONE!--HOW LONG HOW FAR HATH COME UNTO ME THY TONE FROM THE DISTANCE FROM THE PONDS OF LOVE
ART THOU A SLAVE
WHAT IS GREAT IN MAN IS THAT HE IS A BRIDGE AND NOT A GOAL
FOR A PESSIMIST BE IT REMEMBERED SCHOPENHAUER LED QUITE AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE
I AM A LAW ONLY FOR MINE OWN I AM NOT A LAW FOR ALL
OH YE ONLY IS IT YE DARK NIGHTLY ONES THAT EXTRACT WARMTH FROM THE SHINING ONES
GO OUT OF THE WAY OF ALL SUCH ABSOLUTE ONES
GO OUT OF THE WAY OF ALL SUCH ABSOLUTE ONES
THOU MAKEST THIS CAVE SULTRY AND POISONOUS THOU BAD OLD MAGICIAN
IN THE TRUE KNOWING-KNOWLEDGE THERE IS NOTHING GREAT AND NOTHING SMALL THEN THOU ART PERHAPS AN EXPERT ON THE LEECH ASKED ZARATHUSTRA
LET THAT BE YOUR FORMULA OF VIRTUE
HE WHO IS OF THE POPULACE WISHETH TO LIVE GRATUITOUSLY
A PLOUGHSHARE WILL I BE CALLED BY YOU
SMITE DEEPER
THUS HIDEST THOU THY STARS
SO DO ALL BELIEVERS
FORGIVE ME THAT EVENING HATH COME ON THUS SANG ZARATHUSTRA
THE FAINT-HEARTED DEVIL IN THEE WHICH WOULD FAIN FOLD ITS ARMS AND PLACE ITS HANDS IN ITS BOSOM AND TAKE IT EASIER:--THIS FAINT-HEARTED DEVIL PERSUADETH THEE THAT THERE IS A GOD THEREBY HOWEVER DOST THOU BELONG TO THE LIGHT-DREADING TYPE TO WHOM LIGHT NEVER PERMITTETH REPOSE
HARK
HARK
HARK
FOR THE CREATORS ARE HARD
WANDER THOU LEG
NOT EVERYTHING MUST THOU WISH TO SEE
AND QUICKLY WICKEDLY SPRINGING
THE RAINBOW WILL I SHOW THEM AND ALL THE STAIRS TO THE SUPERMAN
AND IF MY WISDOM SHOULD SOME DAY FORSAKE ME:--ALAS
A SUMMER ON THE LOFTIEST HEIGHT WITH COLD FOUNTAINS AND BLISSFUL STILLNESS
WHEN HOWEVER HE HAD ALREADY HIS ARM OUT-STRETCHED FOR THAT PURPOSE HE FELT STILL MORE INCLINED FOR SOMETHING ELSE--NAMELY TO LIE DOWN BESIDE THE TREE AT THE HOUR OF PERFECT NOONTIDE AND SLEEP
SHE GLOWED ME AWAKE THE JEALOUS ONE
THOSE WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE STORMS AND AGITATORS OF THE TREES OF LIFE
NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT THE BOOK WITH THE MOST MYSTERIOUS STARTLING OR SUGGESTIVE TITLE WILL ALWAYS STAND THE BEST CHANCE OF BEING PURCHASED BY THOSE WHO HAVE NO OTHER CRITERIA TO GUIDE THEM IN THEIR CHOICE THAN THE ASPECT OF A TITLE-PAGE
THUS DID THE WORLD PRESENT ITSELF BEFORE ME TO-DAY NOT RIDDLE ENOUGH TO SCARE HUMAN LOVE FROM IT NOT SOLUTION ENOUGH TO PUT TO SLEEP HUMAN WISDOM:--A HUMANLY GOOD THING WAS THE WORLD TO ME TO-DAY OF WHICH SUCH BAD THINGS ARE SAID
BUT CHANGEABLE AM I ONLY AND WILD AND ALTOGETHER A WOMAN AND NO VIRTUOUS ONE
THEY ARE WELL ENOUGH FOR LAUGHTER TO ME
IT IS AN ATTEMPT--SO I TEACH--A LONG SEEKING
SMELLEST THOU NOT ALREADY THE SHAMBLES AND COOKSHOPS OF THE SPIRIT
FOR ALL IS OPEN WITH THEE AND CLEAR
AND LIKEWISE SINNERS AND BAD CONSCIENCES
GRASP AT GOD'S WOE NOT AT ME
HE BIT WITH A STRONG BITE
ALL SUPPRESSED TRUTHS BECOME POISONOUS
INVULNERABLE AM I ONLY IN MY HEEL
NOTHING IS HERE ASHAMED OF CONCEALED CONGEALED FEELINGS
WOULD THAT I WERE WISER
UNDER OLD RUBBISH REST BAD VAPOURS
YET DID YE NOT FLEE FROM ME NOR DID I FLEE FROM YOU
SAWEST THOU NOT HOW OFTEN THEY BECAME DUMB WHEN THOU APPROACHEDST THEM AND HOW THEIR ENERGY LEFT THEM LIKE THE SMOKE OF AN EXTINGUISHING FIRE
OLDER IS THE PLEASURE IN THE HERD THAN THE PLEASURE IN THE EGO
THE WORST THINGS HOWEVER ARE THE PETTY THOUGHTS
THAT AN ACTION IS GOOD IS BECAUSE IT IS UNSELFISH AH
AND WHEN I LOOKED AROUND ME LO
IT IS A LITTLE TRUTH WHICH I CARRY
THAT IS WHAT IT DESIRETH MOST
ALL THINGS WANT TO BE THY PHYSICIANS
THE BEAUTY OF THE SUPERMAN CAME UNTO ME AS A SHADOW
AND ALL MY FINAL HEARTY FERVOUR UP-GLOW'TH TO THEE
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA'S ANIMALS HOWEVER HEARD THESE WORDS THEY RAN AWAY IN TERROR
WE HAVE AGAIN BECOME PIOUS OF LATE DID I SEE THEM RUN FORTH AT EARLY MORN WITH VALOROUS STEPS
THEN SHOW ME THINE AUTHORITY AND THY STRENGTH TO DO SO
O MYSTERY BEFORE NOONTIDE!--RUNNING FIRES WILL I ONE DAY MAKE OF THEM AND HERALDS WITH FLAMING TONGUES HERALD SHALL THEY ONE DAY WITH FLAMING TONGUES
WE ARE NOW HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS
COLDLY LIETH IT ALSO
A HORROR CAME OVER ME WHEN I SAW THOSE BEST ONES NAKED
BUT THE ONE BEHIND FOLLOWED AFTER HIM SO THAT IMMEDIATELY THERE WERE THREE RUNNERS ONE AFTER THE OTHER--NAMELY FOREMOST THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR THEN ZARATHUSTRA AND THIRDLY AND HINDMOST HIS SHADOW
THOU ART ASHAMED OF THE SHAME OF THE GREAT SUFFERER
A WILD WISDOM VERILY!--MY GREAT PINION-RUSTLING LONGING
SO IS THE WILL OF THE CONSCIENTIOUS
I KNOW NOT HOW TO EXPRESS MY MEANING MORE PLAINLY OR MORE PERSONALLY THAN I HAVE DONE ALREADY IN ONE OF THE LAST CHAPTERS APHORISM 382 OF THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE GAYA SCIENZA WE THE NEW THE NAMELESS THE HARD-TO-UNDERSTAND,"--IT SAYS THERE,--"WE FIRSTLINGS OF A YET UNTRIED FUTURE--WE REQUIRE FOR A NEW END ALSO A NEW MEANS NAMELY A NEW HEALTHINESS STRONGER SHARPER TOUGHER BOLDER AND MERRIER THAN ALL HEALTHINESS HITHERTO
DECLINE
DECLINE
LET BE
NOT YET THEIR CRYING AND ZARATHUSTRA STOPPED HIS EARS FOR JUST THEN DID THE YE-A OF THE ASS MIX STRANGELY WITH THE NOISY JUBILATION OF THOSE HIGHER MEN
THUS SPAKE ONCE IN A HAPPY HOUR MY PURITY
DID PERHAPS A NEW KNOWLEDGE COME TO THEE A BITTER GRIEVOUS KNOWLEDGE
MANY A GOOD STRETCH OF ROAD IS STILL AWAITING YOU NOW HAVE YE SLEPT YOUR FILL
WHAT HAPPENETH UNTO ME HE EXCLAIMED WHO PREOCCUPIETH ME SO MUCH IN THIS LIFE AS THIS ONE MAN NAMELY ZARATHUSTRA AND THAT ONE ANIMAL THAT LIVETH ON BLOOD THE LEECH
THIS IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE THE EVIL EYE AND ARE PESSIMISTS BY VIRTUE OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONS
IN THAT YE HAVE DESPISED YE HIGHER MEN THAT MAKETH ME HOPE
LET US AGAIN BECOME LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN AND SAY GOOD GOD!'"--RUINED IN MOUTHS AND STOMACHS BY THE PIOUS CONFECTIONERS
MAY I BEAR THE SUPERMAN IN YOUR LOVE LET THERE BE VALOUR
THE OLD NOONTIDE SLEEPETH IT MOVETH ITS MOUTH
WHAT SAY THE SIMPLETONS ALL IN FLUX
AND WHEN THEY SWELLED AND O'ERSWELLED WITH PITY THERE ALWAYS FLOATED TO THE SURFACE A GREAT FOLLY
STAY
STAY
STAY
I CONJURE YOU MY BRETHREN REMAIN TRUE TO THE EARTH AND BELIEVE NOT THOSE WHO SPEAK UNTO YOU OF SUPEREARTHLY HOPES
SPIRIT IS LIFE WHICH ITSELF CUTTETH INTO LIFE';--THAT LED AND ALLURED ME TO THY DOCTRINE
5 AND LXXIII PARS
I SEEK ZARATHUSTRA AND HERE THERE AROSE A LONG SILENCE BETWEEN THEM
FOR IT HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT A ROPE-DANCER WOULD GIVE A PERFORMANCE
HOW IT SWALLOWETH AND CHEWETH AND RECHEWETH THEM
IT IS NOT A NEBULOUS HOPE WHICH IS TO BE REALISED AT SOME INDEFINITELY REMOTE PERIOD THOUSANDS OF YEARS HENCE
TOO SWEET FRUITS--THESE THE WARRIOR LIKETH NOT
I LOVE YOU
BUT AFTER ALL THEY BELIEVE ONLY THAT POLICEMEN ARE NECESSARY
OR ELSE--WE MUST LIVE WITH ZARATHUSTRA WHY DOTH HE NOT COME WHO HATH SO LONG ANNOUNCED HIMSELF THUS DO MANY PEOPLE ASK
I DID SO ONLY FOR AMUSEMENT THERE WAS ALSO SERIOUSNESS THEREIN THOU ART SOMETHING OF A PENITENT-IN-SPIRIT
OR THEY LOOK FOR LONG EVENINGS AT A CRAFTY LURKING CROSS-SPIDER THAT PREACHETH PRUDENCE TO THE SPIDERS THEMSELVES AND TEACHETH THAT UNDER CROSSES IT IS GOOD FOR COBWEB-SPINNING OR THEY SIT ALL DAY AT SWAMPS WITH ANGLE-RODS AND ON THAT ACCOUNT THINK THEMSELVES PROFOUND
MUTELY MARCHING OVER THE SCORNFUL CLINKING OF PEBBLES TRAMPLING THE STONE THAT LET IT SLIP
THE SUPPER
THE SUPPER
THE SUPPER
THEREFORE DO I DESIRE OF THEE THE GOOD
IT IS THE HONEY IN MY VEINS THAT MAKETH MY BLOOD THICKER AND ALSO MY SOUL STILLER."--"SO WILL IT BE O ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED HIS ANIMALS AND PRESSED UP TO HIM
TO ME THE LAST OF LONESOME ONES OH COME THOU BACK
THY FLIGHT ALLURETH ME THY SEEKING SECURETH ME:--I SUFFER BUT FOR THEE WHAT WOULD I NOT GLADLY BEAR
AND EVEN THE LITTLE GOD MAY HE FIND WHO IS DEAREST TO MAIDENS
BECAUSE THOU ONCE SAIDEST O ZARATHUSTRA
LIKE CATS THEY CURVE THEIR BACKS THEY PURR INWARDLY WITH THEIR APPROACHING HAPPINESS,--ALL GOOD THINGS LAUGH
AND MUST I NOT CONCEAL MYSELF LIKE ONE WHO HATH SWALLOWED GOLD--LEST MY SOUL SHOULD BE RIPPED UP
AND MANY A ONE WHO HATH TURNED AWAY FROM LIFE HATH ONLY TURNED AWAY FROM THE RABBLE
BUT TO ANIMALS BELONGETH INNOCENCE
YE SWEETWOOD-HEART PURSELETS
WHAT WONDER EVEN THAT YE HAVE FAILED AND ONLY HALF-SUCCEEDED YE HALF-SHATTERED ONES
WHEREBY
THIS IS THE TERRIBLE THING TO MINE EYE THAT I FIND MAN BROKEN UP AND SCATTERED ABOUT AS ON A BATTLE AND BUTCHER-GROUND
A PRELUDE AM I TO BETTER PLAYERS O MY BRETHREN
MY JOURNEY IS YET LONG THY JOURNEY IS SHORT SAID THE ADDER SADLY
AND I SAW A GREAT SADNESS COME OVER MANKIND
TOO MUCH HATH BECOME CLEAR UNTO ME
TOO MUCH HATH BECOME CLEAR UNTO ME
IT PANTETH AFTER YOUR THIRST
VERILY THEY TOOK IT NOT THEY FOUND IT NOT IT CAME NOT UNTO THEM AS A VOICE FROM HEAVEN
DIE AT THE RIGHT TIME
DIE AT THE RIGHT TIME
FOR THY NEW LAYS THERE ARE NEEDED NEW LYRES
AND NOW ONCE MORE LIETH THE LEAD OF HIS GUILT UPON HIM AND ONCE MORE IS HIS WEAK REASON SO BENUMBED SO PARALYSED AND SO DULL
RATHER CURSE A LITTLE ALSO
AND ON THE OTHER HAND DISSIMILAR VARIATIONS ARISE UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH APPEAR TO BE NEARLY UNIFORM NIETZSCHE RECOGNISING THIS SAME TRUTH WOULD ASCRIBE PRACTICALLY ALL THE IMPORTANCE TO THE HIGHEST FUNCTIONARIES IN THE ORGANISM IN WHICH THE LIFE-WILL APPEARS AS AN ACTIVE AND FORMATIVE PRINCIPLE AND EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CASES WHERE PASSIVE ORGANISMS ALONE ARE CONCERNED WOULD NOT GIVE SUCH A PROMINENT PLACE TO THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT
THEREFORE O MY BRETHREN A NEW NOBILITY IS NEEDED WHICH SHALL BE THE ADVERSARY OF ALL POPULACE AND POTENTATE RULE AND SHALL INSCRIBE ANEW THE WORD NOBLE ON NEW TABLES
OUT OF YOUR SEED THERE MAY ONE DAY ARISE FOR ME A GENUINE SON AND PERFECT HEIR
I LOVE HIM WHOSE SOUL IS SO OVERFULL THAT HE FORGETTETH HIMSELF AND ALL THINGS ARE IN HIM
THEY INFLAME ONE ANOTHER AND KNOW NOT WHY
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA SO SPAKE HIS DISCIPLE RESENTED IT BUT WAS SILENT
MANY A ONE ALSO WAXETH TOO OLD FOR HIS TRUTHS AND TRIUMPHS
SING
SING
THESE WILL I PUT ON THE SCALES
REGARDING GOOD AND EVIL AS PURELY RELATIVE VALUES IT STANDS TO REASON THAT WHAT MAY BE BAD OR EVIL IN A GIVEN MAN RELATIVE TO A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENT MAY ACTUALLY BE GOOD IF NOT HIGHLY VIRTUOUS IN HIM RELATIVE TO A CERTAIN OTHER ENVIRONMENT
WHAT HATH HAPPENED UNTO ME HE ASKED HIMSELF SOMETHING WARM AND LIVING QUICKENETH ME
COMPANIONS THE CREATOR SEEKETH AND FELLOW-REAPERS
VERILY A STRONG WIND IS ZARATHUSTRA TO ALL LOW PLACES
A TROUBLE AND A TERROR IS THE HERO TO THEM
THAT WHICH IS MINE HOWEVER SHALL THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT BE YOURS
AH WHO HATH NOT SUCCUMBED TO HIS VICTORY
AS THANKS FOR IT I PRAISE MINE TO THEE
THERE DID I GUARD HIS COFFINS
ADAPTATION ACCORDING TO HIM IS MERELY A SECONDARY ACTIVITY A MERE RE-ACTIVITY AND HE IS THEREFORE QUITE OPPOSED TO SPENCER'S DEFINITION
NOW TO MY MIND ALL THIS IS PURE MISUNDERSTANDING AND ERROR
FELLOW-CREATORS THE CREATOR SEEKETH--THOSE WHO GRAVE NEW VALUES ON NEW TABLES
AND JUST LOOK AT THESE MEN
FOR DOGS BELIEVE IN THIEVES AND GHOSTS
ALL THAT IS CALLED EVIL BY THE GOOD MUST COME TOGETHER IN ORDER THAT ONE TRUTH MAY BE BORN
WHEN SHALL I FIND STRENGTH TO HEAR THEE BURROWING AND NO LONGER TREMBLE
HE NOW CARETH NO MORE FOR HIS CHILDREN,"--ANSWERED THE OTHER NIGHT-WATCHMAN
GIVE HEARTENING CHARCOAL-WARMERS
AH THAT MY LIONESS WISDOM WOULD LEARN TO ROAR SOFTLY
IT WAS A STUPID THING THAT THOU DIDST
FOR MUCH COLDNESS AND LONESOMENESS CAME OVER HIS SPIRIT SO THAT EVEN HIS LIMBS BECAME COLDER THEREBY
XLI
XLI
BUT THE STATE LIETH IN ALL LANGUAGES OF GOOD AND EVIL
CHAPTER LXXIII
THE PREACHERS OF DEATH
THE PREACHERS OF DEATH
THE PREACHERS OF DEATH
THIS NEW TABLE DO I PLACE OVER YOU
MY WILD WISDOM BECAME PREGNANT ON THE LONESOME MOUNTAINS
DOTH IT LONG FOR KNOWLEDGE AS THE LION FOR HIS FOOD
FOR WHAT IS NOT CANNOT WILL
SECONDLY THAT IT IS ONLY THROUGH EXISTING LAW AND ORDER THAT ONE ATTAINS TO THAT HEIGHT FROM WHICH NEW LAW AND NEW ORDER MAY BE PROMULGATED
LIFE IS A WELL OF DELIGHT
I KNOW WELL HOW--TO MAKE IT HOT FOR SUCH AS THOU LEAVE OFF SAID THE OLD MAN AND SPRANG UP FROM THE GROUND STRIKE ME NO MORE O ZARATHUSTRA
WHY DIDST THOU LIVE SO LONG BY THE SWAMP THAT THOU THYSELF HADST TO BECOME A FROG AND A TOAD
INTOXICATING JOY AND SELF-FORGETTING DID THE WORLD ONCE SEEM TO ME
THEY CLING TO THEIR STRAW OF LIFE AND MOCK AT THEIR STILL CLINGING TO IT
THUS IS SOLITUDE INADVISABLE UNTO MANY
PURE HATH HIS EYE STILL TO BECOME
THE PRIDE OF YOUTH IS STILL UPON THEE
ONE HEARS--ONE DOES NOT SEEK
THAT--HATH HAD ITS TIME
IN REGARD TO THIS DISCOURSE I SHOULD ONLY LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT NIETZSCHE HAD A PARTICULAR AVERSION TO THE WORD SUICIDE"--SELF-MURDER
O HAPPINESS O PAIN
THY BOAT SHALL NOT REST MUCH LONGER ON DRY GROUND
ARE YE THEN NOT--MY BRETHREN
WHOM DO THEY HATE MOST THE CREATOR HATE THEY MOST HIM WHO BREAKETH THE TABLES AND OLD VALUES THE BREAKER,--HIM THEY CALL THE LAW-BREAKER
BUT BEAUTY'S VOICE SPEAKETH GENTLY
ALL PERIODS PRATE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN YOUR SPIRITS
YE STILL SIT THERE ALL OF YOU WITH LUSTING EYES
BEFORE THE SUN DIDST THOU COME UNTO ME--THE LONESOMEST ONE
RIGHT ON THE PATH WHICH HE WAS ABOUT TO DESCEND CAME TWO KINGS WALKING BEDECKED WITH CROWNS AND PURPLE GIRDLES AND VARIEGATED LIKE FLAMINGOES
THAT LIFE MAY BE FAIR TO BEHOLD ITS GAME MUST BE WELL PLAYED
YOUR CRUTCH HOWEVER I AM NOT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
MAY HIGHER ONES PASS OVER UPON YOU
HE CAME TO SAVE HIGHER MEN;--TO GIVE THEM THAT FREEDOM BY WHICH ALONE THEY CAN DEVELOP AND REACH THEIR ZENITH SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LIV END IT HAS BEEN ARGUED AND WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE THAT NO SUCH PHILOSOPHY IS REQUIRED BY HIGHER MEN THAT AS A MATTER OF FACT HIGHER MEN BY VIRTUE OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONS ALWAYS DO STAND BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL AND NEVER ALLOW ANYTHING TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THEIR COMPLETE GROWTH
AND LO IT TURNED OUT THAT HE COULD NOT FIND THEM EXCEPT HE HIMSELF SHOULD FIRST CREATE THEM
NEVER DID THE ONE NEIGHBOUR UNDERSTAND THE OTHER
CONCEAL THYSELF NOT BEHIND THY DEFIANCE AND I WEPT AND TREMBLED LIKE A CHILD AND SAID
IN THE MORNING I USED TO START OUT IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION UP THE GLORIOUS ROAD TO ZOAGLI WHICH RISES ALOFT THROUGH A FOREST OF PINES AND GIVES ONE A VIEW FAR OUT INTO THE SEA
THOU ART NOT PLEASING UNTO ME FORGIVE ME ANSWERED THE SHADOW THAT IT IS I
THAT GOD HAD TO DIE
ON EVERY SURFACE HAVE I ALREADY SAT!...I BECOME THIN I AM ALMOST EQUAL TO A SHADOW AT LAST IN DESPAIR SUCH MEN DO INDEED CRY OUT
AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY IS BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN THIS DISCOURSE
AH WHERE IN THE WORLD HAVE THERE BEEN GREATER FOLLIES THAN WITH THE PITIFUL
AH WHERE IN THE WORLD HAVE THERE BEEN GREATER FOLLIES THAN WITH THE PITIFUL
BUT WHY DOTH ZARATHUSTRA SPEAK OTHERWISE UNTO HIS PUPILS--THAN UNTO HIMSELF XLIII
ON THE EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY HOWEVER HE AGAIN OPENED HIS EARS THOUGH HE STILL KEPT SILENT
THEY REPRESENT THEMSELVES THEY INVENT THEMSELVES
FLATTERERS ARE THEY AND WHIMPERERS AND NOTHING MORE
ALL IS ALIKE NOTHING IS WORTH WHILE KNOWLEDGE STRANGLETH A LONG TWILIGHT LIMPED ON BEFORE ME A FATALLY WEARY FATALLY INTOXICATED SADNESS WHICH SPAKE WITH YAWNING MOUTH
HARD STRIKEST THOU WITH THY TRUTHS THY CUDGEL FORCETH FROM ME--THIS TRUTH FLATTER NOT ANSWERED ZARATHUSTRA STILL EXCITED AND FROWNING THOU STAGE-PLAYER FROM THE HEART
AND UNWILLINGLY ONLY DID I ASK MY WAY--THAT WAS ALWAYS COUNTER TO MY TASTE
AT LAST IN DESPAIR ZARATHUSTRA APPEALS TO THE YOUNG MAN'S WILL
THIS MOMENT BUT SHOULD ONE FOLLOW THEM FURTHER--AND EVER FURTHER AND FURTHER ON THINKEST THOU DWARF THAT THESE ROADS WOULD BE ETERNALLY ANTITHETICAL EVERYTHING STRAIGHT LIETH MURMURED THE DWARF CONTEMPTUOUSLY
HOW SHE LAUGHETH HOW SHE WHEEZETH AND PANTETH THE MIDNIGHT
HE DIED TOO EARLY
LET THE FUTURE AND THE FURTHEST BE THE MOTIVE OF THY TO-DAY
THEY DO NOT FORGIVE ME FOR NOT ENVYING THEIR VIRTUES
AND WHEN THERE ARE BUT FIVE OF YOU TOGETHER A SIXTH MUST ALWAYS DIE
CHASTITY IS A VIRTUE WITH SOME BUT WITH MANY ALMOST A VICE
MINE ENEMIES HAVE GROWN POWERFUL AND HAVE DISFIGURED THE LIKENESS OF MY DOCTRINE SO THAT MY DEAREST ONES HAVE TO BLUSH FOR THE GIFTS THAT I GAVE THEM
WE OFFERED THAT GUEST HARBOUR AND HEART
IN THE FOURTEENTH VERSE OF THIS DISCOURSE NIETZSCHE DEFINES THE SOLEMN DUTY HE IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF
FOR EVERYWHERE DO I SMELL SMALL CONCEALED COMMUNITIES
AND ZARATHUSTRA CONTEMPLATED THE TREE BESIDE WHICH THEY STOOD AND SPAKE THUS
DOWNWARD INTO THE VALLEYS WILL I HURL MY SPEECH
IN SOME AGETH THE HEART FIRST AND IN OTHERS THE SPIRIT
HATH NOT YOUR LUST JUST DISGUISED ITSELF AND TAKEN THE NAME OF FELLOW-SUFFERING
IT IS I WHO AM THE REGULATING FINGER OF GOD"--THUS ROARETH THE MONSTER
MY KINGDOM IS NO LONGER OF THIS WORLD
FROM THE RABBLE HAVE WE GONE OUT OF THE WAY FROM ALL THOSE BAWLERS AND SCRIBE-BLOWFLIES FROM THE TRADER-STENCH THE AMBITION-FIDGETING THE BAD BREATH
BUT BEHOLD HERE IT WAS A CLOUD OF LOVE AND SHOWERED UPON A NEW FRIEND
THE WIND COMETH OUT AT LAST
MORE DANGEROUS HAVE I FOUND IT AMONG MEN THAN AMONG ANIMALS
THAT I MAY SPEAK IN PARABLES AND HALT AND STAMMER LIKE THE POETS
BETTER FOR THEE TO REAR UP THY DEVIL
STAY SIT DOWN
POETS
POETS
POETS
XIII

AND ONLY WHEN YE HAVE ALL DENIED ME WILL I RETURN UNTO YOU
AND ONLY WHEN YE HAVE ALL DENIED ME WILL I RETURN UNTO YOU
FOR THINE ENEMIES SHOWED US THY LIKENESS IN THEIR MIRROR
LET YOUR PEACE BE A VICTORY
WAS IT NOT MY DISGUST AT THE RICHEST
ZARATHUSTRA HE WAS CALLED
23
FULL IS THE EARTH OF THE SUPERFLUOUS
UNHAPPY DO I ALSO CALL THOSE WHO HAVE EVER TO WAIT,--THEY ARE REPUGNANT TO MY TASTE--ALL THE TOLL-GATHERERS AND TRADERS AND KINGS AND OTHER LANDKEEPERS AND SHOPKEEPERS
WOE TO ME
AND WHEN A SMALL KINDNESS IS NOT FORGOTTEN IT BECOMETH A GNAWING WORM
A BROKEN BACKBONE
AND THUS SPAKE HE TO HIS HEART
ALWAYS DIDST THOU PRICK US ANEW IN HEART AND EAR WITH THY SAYINGS
YEA I WOULD THAT THE EARTH SHOOK WITH CONVULSIONS WHEN A SAINT AND A GOOSE MATE WITH ONE ANOTHER
THAT IS THE TRUE DOCTRINE OF WILL AND EMANCIPATION--SO TEACHETH YOU ZARATHUSTRA
EVERYWHERE DO I SEE LOWER DOORWAYS
AND IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
LET IT NOT FLY AWAY FROM THE EARTHLY AND BEAT AGAINST ETERNAL WALLS WITH ITS WINGS
THREE TIMES NAY THOU WARNEDST AGAINST HIS ERROR
HE RECOGNISED THAT THOUGH BUDDHISM IS UNDOUBTEDLY A RELIGION FOR DECADENTS ITS DECADENT VALUES EMANATE FROM THE HIGHER AND NOT AS IN CHRISTIANITY FROM THE LOWER GRADES OF SOCIETY
I FAILED TO PULL THE SERPENT OUT OF HIS THROAT
XXXIII
XXXIII
HOW SHOULD YE THEN BE WORLD-WEARY ONES
SHREWD INDEED ARE THEY THEIR VIRTUES HAVE SHREWD FINGERS
AND IF I BE SO IT IS PREFERABLY AT A DISTANCE
IT IS VERILY BECOMING TOO MUCH FOR ME
WHEN HE HAD TAKEN HIS ARM FROM HIS FACE HE LOOKED AT THE SERPENT
AND FROM HIM WHO HATH TOO MUCH BEHIND COULDST THOU WELL ALSO TAKE AWAY A LITTLE;--THAT I THINK WOULD BE THE RIGHT METHOD TO MAKE THE CRIPPLES BELIEVE IN ZARATHUSTRA ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER ANSWERED THUS UNTO HIM WHO SO SPAKE
AS DEEPLY AS MAN LOOKETH INTO LIFE SO DEEPLY ALSO DOTH HE LOOK INTO SUFFERING
WHAT IS THERE TO BE WONDERED AT
ALL THY PASSIONS IN THE END BECAME VIRTUES AND ALL THY DEVILS ANGELS
THOU ART MISTAKEN
AND IF YE YOURSELVES HAVE BEEN A FAILURE HATH MAN THEREFORE--BEEN A FAILURE
IN YOUR LOVE BE YOUR HONOUR
THOU COULDST NOT ENDURE HIM WHO BEHELD THEE,--WHO EVER BEHELD THEE THROUGH AND THROUGH THOU UGLIEST MAN
NOT EVERY ONE IS A BORN WATER-DRINKER LIKE ZARATHUSTRA
BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL IS THY DOMAIN
THE DEW FALLETH THE HOUR COMETH THE HOUR IN WHICH I FROST AND FREEZE WHICH ASKETH AND ASKETH AND ASKETH
AND THIS DO I CALL IMMACULATE PERCEPTION OF ALL THINGS
THAT HOWEVER WHICH IS IN EXISTENCE--HOW COULD IT STILL STRIVE FOR EXISTENCE
OH THOU HEAVENLY SIMILE OF MY SOUL AND ITS WANTONNESS
XLVI
XLVI
THUS CAME THEY TO A CROSSROAD
THE INVOLUNTARINESS OF THE FIGURES AND SIMILES IS THE MOST REMARKABLE THING
A SEER A PURPOSER A CREATOR A FUTURE ITSELF AND A BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE--AND ALAS
WELL THEN DO LIKE ME
IS THE SEA NOT FULL OF GREEN ISLANDS
SING NOW YOURSELVES THE SONG THE NAME OF WHICH IS ONCE MORE THE SIGNIFICATION OF WHICH IS UNTO ALL ETERNITY!"--SING YE HIGHER MEN ZARATHUSTRA'S ROUNDELAY
HASTEN
O MINE OLD HEART
CONTEMPT IS STILL IN HIS EYE AND LOATHING HIDETH IN HIS MOUTH
AND IN ORDER TO WAGE WAR ONE MUST BE CAPABLE OF BEING AN ENEMY
O MY SOUL I TAUGHT THEE SO TO PERSUADE THAT THOU PERSUADEST EVEN THE GROUNDS THEMSELVES TO THEE
WITH THE NEW MORNING HOWEVER THERE CAME UNTO ME A NEW TRUTH
FRAGMENTS AND LIMBS AND FEARFUL CHANCES--BUT NO MEN
SO THEY PRESS THEE
AND BLESS THEM BEFORE EVENTIDE WITH MY HAPPINESS
THEREUPON ZARATHUSTRA RUSHED FORWARD TO HIS CAVE AND BEHOLD
INTELLIGENTLY DOTH THE BODY PURIFY ITSELF
REGARDED IN THIS LIGHT ALL HIS VIEWS ON WOMAN APPEAR NOT ONLY NECESSARY BUT JUST SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVI PAR
ZARATHUSTRA HERE ADDRESSES CRIPPLES
I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN
EVER TO SAY YE-A--THAT HATH ONLY THE ASS LEARNT AND THOSE LIKE IT DEEP YELLOW AND HOT RED--SO WANTETH MY TASTE--IT MIXETH BLOOD WITH ALL COLOURS
FROM THE FUTURE COME WINDS WITH STEALTHY PINIONS AND TO FINE EARS GOOD TIDINGS ARE PROCLAIMED
HOW IS MAN TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF BEST LONGEST MOST PLEASANTLY THEREBY--ARE THEY THE MASTERS OF TO-DAY
GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT AND DRINK I FORGOT IT DURING THE DAY
THEN FLEDST THOU BACK FROM MY BOUND
ALSO AMONGST MEN THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL BROOD OF THE WARM SUN AND MUCH THAT IS MARVELLOUS IN THE WICKED
IN THIS DISCOURSE NIETZSCHE WISHES TO GIVE HIS FOLLOWERS A WARNING
FROM THEIR MISERY THEY SOUGHT ESCAPE AND THE STARS WERE TOO REMOTE FOR THEM
THERE IS ALWAYS SOME MADNESS IN LOVE
WE OTHERS HOWEVER TO WHOM LIFE HATH GIVEN ITSELF--WE ARE EVER CONSIDERING WHAT WE CAN BEST GIVE IN RETURN
WITH THEE HAVE I WANDERED ABOUT IN THE REMOTEST COLDEST WORLDS LIKE A PHANTOM THAT VOLUNTARILY HAUNTETH WINTER ROOFS AND SNOWS
WOE UNTO THEM THAT LAUGH NOW DID HE HIMSELF FIND NO CAUSE FOR LAUGHTER ON THE EARTH
WOE UNTO THEM THAT LAUGH NOW DID HE HIMSELF FIND NO CAUSE FOR LAUGHTER ON THE EARTH
AND IN THE ROARING AND WHISTLING AND WHIZZING THE COFFIN BURST UP AND SPOUTED OUT A THOUSAND PEALS OF LAUGHTER
AND JUST THEN BEGAN THE UGLIEST MAN TO GURGLE AND SNORT AS IF SOMETHING UNUTTERABLE IN HIM TRIED TO FIND EXPRESSION
BUT THE STREAM OF MY LOVE BEARETH THIS ALONG WITH IT DOWN--TO THE SEA
FOR THUS SAITH VIRTUE
O MY SOUL I HAVE TAUGHT THEE TO SAY TO-DAY AS ONCE ON A TIME AND FORMERLY AND TO DANCE THY MEASURE OVER EVERY HERE AND THERE AND YONDER
TO MAN CLINGETH MY WILL
HAVE YE COURAGE O MY BRETHREN
THEN THOU CARRIEDST THINE ASHES INTO THE MOUNTAINS
WITH THOSE RHYMES OF ZARATHUSTRA THE KINGS WERE DELIGHTED
BUT I BELIEVE HE KNOWETH WELL HOW TO SLEEP
WHERE HATH IT BEEN AND THEREUPON ZARATHUSTRA KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE
HOW WELL THIS DAY IS ABOUT TO END WHICH BEGAN SO BADLY AND GLOOMILY
HE THAT FEEDETH THE HUNGRY REFRESHETH HIS OWN SOUL SAITH WISDOM THE OLD MAN WITHDREW BUT CAME BACK IMMEDIATELY AND OFFERED ZARATHUSTRA BREAD AND WINE
THE GLOOMY FLAME OF LIVING PYRES
I FEEL GLAD AND GRIEVED THEREBY
TOO HIGH AND STEEP DO WE HERE DWELL FOR ALL UNCLEANLY ONES AND THEIR THIRST
ALL IS IN THE SEA
THE LINES IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE EVIDENCE ENOUGH OF HIS EARNESTNESS
OTHERWISE ONE PRATETH AND QUARRELLETH
AS YET DO I NOT MYSELF GO DOWN AS I MUST DO AMONGST MEN
OR IS IT THE SHAME OF BEING TWO OF US THAT MAKETH THEE BLUSH!--DOST THOU BID ME GO AND BE SILENT BECAUSE NOW--DAY COMETH
THE PEOPLE TOLD ME HOWEVER THAT THE BIG EAR WAS NOT ONLY A MAN BUT A GREAT MAN A GENIUS
FOR HIGHER ONES STRONGER ONES TRIUMPHANTER ONES MERRIER ONES FOR SUCH AS ARE BUILT SQUARELY IN BODY AND SOUL
MURDEROUS MINSTREL INSTRUMENT OF EVIL MOST INNOCENT INSTRUMENT
MY FUTURE IS THE DARKEST THING IN THE WORLD TO ME BUT AS THERE STILL REMAINS A GREAT DEAL FOR ME TO DO I SUPPOSE I OUGHT RATHER TO THINK OF DOING THIS THAN OF MY FUTURE AND LEAVE THE REST TO THEE AND THE GODS THE SECOND PART OF ZARATHUSTRA WAS WRITTEN BETWEEN THE 26TH OF JUNE AND THE 6TH JULY
LXI
SUCH FOOD MAY SURE ENOUGH NOT BE PROPER FOR CHILDREN NOR EVEN FOR LONGING GIRLS OLD AND YOUNG
VERILY I DIVINE YOU WELL MY DISCIPLES
IT IS AGAINST THIS MOVEMENT THAT NIETZSCHE RAISES HIS VOICE
ALL THAT IS DEEP SHALL ASCEND--TO MY HEIGHT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
HE IS SHAMEFAST AND BASHFUL WITH THOSE WHO SURROUND HIM AND WISHES NOT TO BE DISCOVERED BY THEM JUST AS ONE INSTINCTIVELY AVOIDS ALL LAVISH DISPLAY OF COMFORT OR WEALTH IN THE PRESENCE OF A POOR FRIEND
NEVER YET HATH THERE BEEN A SUPERMAN
NEVER YET HATH THERE BEEN A SUPERMAN
HE CARRIETH OUR BURDENS HE HATH TAKEN UPON HIM THE FORM OF A SERVANT HE IS PATIENT OF HEART AND NEVER SAITH NAY
WHAT SEEKST THOU BY THY STEALING
TIME ITSELF IS A CIRCLE THOU SPIRIT OF GRAVITY SAID I WRATHFULLY DO NOT TAKE IT TOO LIGHTLY
THAT THE POETS LIE TOO MUCH?--BUT ZARATHUSTRA ALSO IS A POET
WHAT THE FATHER HATH HID COMETH OUT IN THE SON
I HEAR ZARATHUSTRA AND JUST NOW WAS I THINKING OF HIM ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED
THOU SURELY KNOWEST THINE OWN SPECIES BEST
16
BUT HE MISTAKES THE NATURE OF THE CHANGE
OR GOEST THOU THYSELF ON A THIEF'S ERRAND THOU FRIEND OF THE EVIL VERILY MY BROTHER SAID ZARATHUSTRA IT IS A TREASURE THAT HATH BEEN GIVEN ME
IN THE TOWER IS THE PLACE FOR THEE THOU SHOULDST BE LOCKED UP
WITH THEE HAVE I BROKEN UP WHATEVER MY HEART REVERED
BUT TAKE CARE LEST IT BE THY FATE TO SUFFER ALL THEIR POISONOUS INJUSTICE
YE SHALL ONLY HAVE FOES TO BE HATED
WHAT WERE ONCE BUT EXPEDIENTS DEVISED FOR THE DISCIPLINE OF A CERTAIN PORTION OF HUMANITY HAD NOW PASSED INTO MAN'S BLOOD AND HAD BECOME INSTINCTS
AND ALL HUMAN HUBBUB WISHETH TO BE INDULGED AND TOLERATED
OUT OF HIS EYE SPEAKETH THE GREAT CONTEMPT
VENGEANCE PUNISHMENT RECOMPENSE RETRIBUTION
BUT AT LAST HIS HEART CHANGED,--AND RISING ONE MORNING WITH THE ROSY DAWN HE WENT BEFORE THE SUN AND SPAKE THUS UNTO IT
IT WAS THE LIE OF MY PITY THAT I KNEW IN EVERY ONE THAT I SAW AND SCENTED IN EVERY ONE WHAT WAS ENOUGH OF SPIRIT FOR HIM AND WHAT WAS TOO MUCH
HAIL TO THEE O ZARATHUSTRA THAT THOU ART AGAIN UPON THY FEET
OR SHALL OUR PLEDGING BE BLUNDERING GIVE US A SET TERM AND A SMALL MARRIAGE THAT WE MAY SEE IF WE ARE FIT FOR THE GREAT MARRIAGE
THE DISCOURSES
MYSELF DO I OFFER UNTO MY LOVE AND MY NEIGHBOUR AS MYSELF"--SUCH IS THE LANGUAGE OF ALL CREATORS
MINE EYE NO LONGER OVERFLOWETH FOR THE SHAME OF SUPPLIANTS
FOR HE WHO HIMSELF STANDETH LIKE YOU ON SICKLY AND TENDER LEGS WISHETH ABOVE ALL TO BE TREATED INDULGENTLY WHETHER HE BE CONSCIOUS OF IT OR HIDE IT FROM HIMSELF
STILL HE RECOGNISED A MOST DECIDED BUDDHISTIC INFLUENCE IN CHRIST'S TEACHING AND THE WORDS IN VERSES 29 30 AND 31 ARE VERY REMINISCENT OF HIS VIEWS IN REGARD TO THE CHRISTIAN SAVIOR
DO I COUNSEL YOU TO SLAY YOUR INSTINCTS
DO I COUNSEL YOU TO SLAY YOUR INSTINCTS
NEITHER LIKE TO BE SOUGHT FOR
ALL OF THEM OLD PEOPLE BUT WITH COMFORTED BRAVE HEARTS AND ASTONISHED IN THEMSELVES THAT IT WAS SO WELL WITH THEM ON EARTH
THE THAWING WIND BLOWETH!"--THUS PREACH MY BRETHREN THROUGH ALL THE STREETS
VERILY NOTHING SICK OR DISEASED IS THERE IN SUCH LONGING AND DESCENDING
TOO PROUD ART THOU TO KILL THESE SWEET-TOOTHS
JOY--DEEPER STILL THAN GRIEF CAN BE
FOR MAN IS THE BEST BEAST OF PREY
ALL THAT IS ZARATHUSTRA
GO APART
AND VERILY
AND VERILY
PERHAPS THAT THE OLD GOD NO LONGER LIVETH IN WHOM ALL THE WORLD ONCE BELIEVED THOU SAYEST IT ANSWERED THE OLD MAN SORROWFULLY
FOR THINE ANIMALS KNOW IT WELL O ZARATHUSTRA WHO THOU ART AND MUST BECOME
THAT DAY I HAPPENED TO BE WANDERING THROUGH THE WOODS ALONGSIDE OF THE LAKE OF SILVAPLANA AND I HALTED BESIDE A HUGE PYRAMIDAL AND TOWERING ROCK NOT FAR FROM SURLEI
BUT THAT HATH EVER BEEN THE PRUDENCE OF THE COWARDLY
HOW HIGH ARE MY SUMMITS NO ONE HATH YET TOLD ME
FOR TO-DAY HAVE THE PETTY PEOPLE BECOME MASTER
IT HONOURETH THEE SAYS ZARATHUSTRA THAT THOU SOUGHTEST FOR GREATNESS BUT IT BETRAYETH THEE ALSO
THAT IS THE HARDEST FOR ALL OF YOU YE SUBLIME ONES
THAT HE TOOK REVENGE ON HIS POTS AND CREATIONS HOWEVER BECAUSE THEY TURNED OUT BADLY--THAT WAS A SIN AGAINST GOOD TASTE
KEEP YOUR EYE CLEAR OF THEIR FOR AND AGAINST
AS MUCH AS YE GIVE TO YOUR FRIEND WILL I GIVE EVEN TO MY FOE AND WILL NOT HAVE BECOME POORER THEREBY
CHARACTERS OF BLOOD DID THEY WRITE ON THE WAY THEY WENT AND THEIR FOLLY TAUGHT THAT TRUTH IS PROVED BY BLOOD
AND WOULD YE HEAR THIS LIKEWISE
AND EVEN THEE WILL I WHIP WITH MY SPITE
AND IF EVER I LIED THEN DID I LIE OUT OF LOVE
LIKE A STORM DO THE SUNS PURSUE THEIR COURSES
THOU ABYSS OF LIGHT
BUT SEE TO IT MY DISCIPLES THAT WE HAVE A GOOD REPAST
15
15
THEY DROVE BEFORE THEM A LADEN ASS
AND AGAIN THERE ARE THOSE WHO REGARD IT AS VIRTUE TO SAY
MAN IS A ROPE STRETCHED BETWEEN THE ANIMAL AND THE SUPERMAN--A ROPE OVER AN ABYSS
DISTRUST ALL IN WHOM THE IMPULSE TO PUNISH IS POWERFUL
THEN DID IT FIND THOSE OPEN HOSPITABLE SOULS
HE WARNS US NOT TO CONFOUND MALTHUS WITH NATURE
AND WHATEVER HARM THE WORLD-MALIGNERS MAY DO THE HARM OF THE GOOD IS THE HARMFULEST HARM
BUT WHERE THE RABBLE ALSO DRINK THERE ALL FOUNTAINS ARE POISONED
FOR I WAS AFRAID OF MINE OWN THOUGHTS AND ARREAR-THOUGHTS
WHY STILL RATTLE YE RATTLE-SNAKES
THOU HAST THE POWER AND THOU WILT NOT RULE AND I ANSWERED
AND CLOSE BESIDE MY KNOWLEDGE LIETH MY BLACK IGNORANCE
SINCE I HAVE KNOWN THE BODY BETTER"--SAID ZARATHUSTRA TO ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES--"THE SPIRIT HATH ONLY BEEN TO ME SYMBOLICALLY SPIRIT
RANSOM-GOLD
LET IN ZARATHUSTRA
IN OUR BODY DWELLETH STILL ALL THIS DELUSION AND BLUNDERING
AND I KNEW HOW TO OPEN WITH THEM THE MOST CREAKING OF ALL GATES
IT IS THEIR MADNESS--AS IF HAPPINESS SAT ON THE THRONE
AND WHEN I DESIRED HONEY I ONLY DESIRED BAIT AND SWEET MUCUS AND MUCILAGE FOR WHICH EVEN THE MOUTHS OF GROWLING BEARS AND STRANGE SULKY EVIL BIRDS WATER
THIS HOWEVER IS THE THIRD THING WHICH I HEARD--NAMELY THAT COMMANDING IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN OBEYING
WITH THE CRAVING OF HUNGER IT MEASURETH HIM WHO HATH ABUNDANCE
AND YE LOOKED ON AT IT ALL
FOR IT SEEKETH BY ALL MEANS TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT CREATURE ON EARTH THE STATE
LIFE IS A WELL OF DELIGHT BUT TO HIM IN WHOM THE RUINED STOMACH SPEAKETH THE FATHER OF AFFLICTION ALL FOUNTAINS ARE POISONED
HE IS GONE
BUT I AM ASKING THE IMPOSSIBLE
YE CROWD AROUND YOUR NEIGHBOUR AND HAVE FINE WORDS FOR IT
THUS SEEKETH HE HIS OWN DOWN-GOING THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE HE IS CALLED IN THIS DISCOURSE
DERISIVELY DIDST THOU LAUGH WHEN I CALLED THEE UNFATHOMABLE
14
14
AWAY WITH THE NASTINESS AND THE VIRULENT REPTILE BUT ONE THING IS THE THOUGHT ANOTHER THING IS THE DEED AND ANOTHER THING IS THE IDEA OF THE DEED
THUS WILT THOU COMMAND AND IN COMMANDING GO FOREMOST AND I ANSWERED
OTHERWISE WILT THOU SEEK TRUTH DURING THE NIGHT AND THY SOUL WILL HAVE BEEN HUNGRY
DID THEIR EAR PERHAPS HEARKEN YEARNINGLY-LONG FOR ME IN VAIN AND FOR MY TRUMPET-NOTES AND HERALD-CALLS
AND NOW IS HE DISGUSTED WITH THE OLD FOOTPATH
BUT YE KNOW ALSO THAT MY HAPPINESS IS HEAVY AND NOT LIKE A FLUID WAVE OF WATER
ONE IS ONLY PREGNANT WITH ONE'S OWN CHILD
AND IT WAS THE IDEA OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS WHICH FINALLY INDUCED MY BROTHER TO SET FORTH HIS NEW VIEWS IN POETIC LANGUAGE
HOW DOTH THAT HAPPEN
WE SET OUR CHAIR IN THE MIDST"--SO SAITH THEIR SMIRKING UNTO ME--"AND AS FAR FROM DYING GLADIATORS AS FROM SATISFIED SWINE THAT HOWEVER IS--MEDIOCRITY THOUGH IT BE CALLED MODERATION 3
DEPART FROM ME AND GUARD YOURSELVES AGAINST ZARATHUSTRA
BUT AT LAST IT BECAME NIGHT AND A COLD WIND BLEW UPON THE LONELY ONE
IT IS POVERTY AND POLLUTION AND WRETCHED SELF-COMPLACENCY THE HOUR WHEN YE SAY
IN THE LAST VERSE OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH HOWEVER AFTER HAILING HIS DEEPEST THOUGHT HE CRIES
HE HIMSELF OFTEN SEEMETH TO ME LIKE THE BEAUTIFUL MASK OF A SAINT LIKE A NEW STRANGE MUMMERY IN WHICH MINE EVIL SPIRIT THE MELANCHOLY DEVIL DELIGHTETH:--I LOVE ZARATHUSTRA SO DOTH IT OFTEN SEEM TO ME FOR THE SAKE OF MINE EVIL SPIRIT BUT ALREADY DOTH IT ATTACK ME AND CONSTRAIN ME THIS SPIRIT OF MELANCHOLY THIS EVENING-TWILIGHT DEVIL
O HAPPINESS
O HAPPINESS
O HAPPINESS
FOR THE HOUR HATH COME THOU KNOWEST IT FORSOOTH FOR THE GREAT EVIL LONG SLOW MOB-AND-SLAVE-INSURRECTION
BUT SIGNS ARE NOT WANTING WHICH SHOW THAT THE NOBLEST WICKEDNESS IS FAST VANISHING FROM SOCIETY--THE WICKEDNESS OF COURAGE AND DETERMINATION--AND THAT NIETZSCHE HAD GOOD REASONS FOR CRYING
BESIDES ALL OF YOU HAVE THOUGHT TOO MUCH ABOUT FREEZING DROWNING SUFFOCATING AND OTHER BODILY DANGERS
O MY BRETHREN
O MY BRETHREN
THEY HAVE BECOME SMALLER AND EVER BECOME SMALLER:--THE REASON THEREOF IS THEIR DOCTRINE OF HAPPINESS AND VIRTUE
ALSO AS IT WERE A CRIPPLE ON THIS BRIDGE
HOW CAN I GIVE EVERY ONE HIS OWN
HATH NOT BLISS COME UNTO ME LIKE A WHIRLWIND
ART THOU NOT THE LIGHT OF MY FIRE
BE TO-NIGHT ITS GUEST
FOR WHAT WOULD THEY CRY
OH ALL YE GLEAMS OF LOVE YE DIVINE FLEETING GLEAMS
THERE ARE ACTORS WITHOUT KNOWING IT AMONGST THEM AND ACTORS WITHOUT INTENDING IT THE GENUINE ONES ARE ALWAYS RARE ESPECIALLY THE GENUINE ACTORS
WILLINGLY DO I BESTOW AS FRIEND TO FRIENDS
AND THIS EXPLAINS WHY THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE FIRST AND OFTEN THE ONLY ONE OF NIETZSCHE'S BOOKS THAT FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF THE UNINITIATED
YET STRANGE SOUNDETH THE PRECEPT
YE HIGHER MEN O HOW MUCH IS STILL POSSIBLE
THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR
THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR
THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR
WE KEEP SILENT TO EACH OTHER WE SMILE OUR KNOWLEDGE TO EACH OTHER
HATH THERE EVER BEEN ANYTHING FILTHIER ON EARTH THAN THE SAINTS OF THE WILDERNESS
IT WAS THEN THAT THE THOUGHT STRUCK ME
MAWKISH AND OVER-MELLOW BECOMETH THE FRUIT IN THEIR HANDS
WHY DIDST THOU TURN ROUND
THE FALL OF OUR FOOTSTEPS RINGETH TOO HOLLOW THROUGH THEIR STREETS
ONE SHOULD NOT STIR UP THE MARSH
IT COULD WELL HAVE HAPPENED IN THAT WAY
WOE UNTO ALL LOVING ONES WHO HAVE NOT AN ELEVATION WHICH IS ABOVE THEIR PITY
WOE UNTO ALL LOVING ONES WHO HAVE NOT AN ELEVATION WHICH IS ABOVE THEIR PITY
A ROBBER SHALL ZARATHUSTRA BE CALLED BY THE HERDSMEN
AND CRINGING ENRAPTURED FRANTICAL MY TAIL FRIENDLY--WAGGLE
UP THITHER IS THE WAY TO ZARATHUSTRA'S CAVE
THUS AM I IN THE MIDST OF MY WORK TO MY CHILDREN GOING AND FROM THEM RETURNING
BEHIND THEM THERE IS STILL THE SELF
WHAT SAID HE HAVE NOT THE MOST LUDICROUS THINGS ALWAYS HAPPENED TO US OLD ANCHORITES AND SAINTS
WAR AND WARRIORS
WAR AND WARRIORS
WHO IS ZARATHUSTRA AND THOSE INTO WHOSE EARS THOU HAST AT ANY TIME DRIPPED THY SONG AND THY HONEY
THUS HAVE YE NEVER EXPERIENCED THE HAPPINESS OF THE ALARM OF THE SPIRIT
THOU WILT HAVE TO SING WITH PASSIONATE SONG UNTIL ALL SEAS TURN CALM TO HEARKEN UNTO THY LONGING UNTIL OVER CALM LONGING SEAS THE BARK GLIDETH THE GOLDEN MARVEL AROUND THE GOLD OF WHICH ALL GOOD BAD AND MARVELLOUS THINGS FRISK ALSO MANY LARGE AND SMALL ANIMALS AND EVERYTHING THAT HATH LIGHT MARVELLOUS FEET SO THAT IT CAN RUN ON VIOLET-BLUE PATHS TOWARDS THE GOLDEN MARVEL THE SPONTANEOUS BARK AND ITS MASTER
AGAIN IT DECEIVETH ABOUT MANY THINGS IN MAN THAT MANY A SHELL IS POOR AND PITIABLE AND TOO MUCH OF A SHELL
BUT DOWN THERE--THERE SPEAKETH EVERYTHING THERE IS EVERYTHING MISHEARD
HOT NOONTIDE SLEEPETH ON THE FIELDS
LET THEM SYMPATHISE WITH ME AND SIGH WITH ME ON ACCOUNT OF MY CHILBLAINS
AND OFTEN IS IT GREATER BRAVERY TO KEEP QUIET AND PASS BY THAT THEREBY ONE MAY RESERVE ONESELF FOR A WORTHIER FOE
MADNESS AFTER THE DEED I CALL THIS
AND THEREFORE DO I LIVE BLINDLY AMONG MEN AS IF I KNEW THEM NOT
WHAT THEN DO WE RUN OUT OF THE WAY OF
THIS LIKE THE FIRST PART OF THE SOOTHSAYER IS OBVIOUSLY A REFERENCE TO THE SCHOPENHAUERIAN PESSIMISM
COLOURED VAPOURS BEFORE THE EYES OF A DIVINELY DISSATISFIED ONE
AND ONLY WHEN IT HATH BEEN QUITE COOKED DO I WELCOME IT AS MY FOOD
SPIT ON THE CITY OF COMPRESSED SOULS AND SLENDER BREASTS OF POINTED EYES AND STICKY FINGERS ON THE CITY OF THE OBTRUSIVE THE BRAZEN-FACED THE PEN-DEMAGOGUES AND TONGUE-DEMAGOGUES THE OVERHEATED AMBITIOUS WHERE EVERYTHING MAIMED ILL-FAMED LUSTFUL UNTRUSTFUL OVER-MELLOW SICKLY-YELLOW AND SEDITIOUS FESTERETH PERNICIOUS SPIT ON THE GREAT CITY AND TURN BACK HERE HOWEVER DID ZARATHUSTRA INTERRUPT THE FOAMING FOOL AND SHUT HIS MOUTH STOP THIS AT ONCE
THAT FUTURE WHICH I CONTEMPLATE
YE UNDERSTAND HOW TO ROAR AND OBSCURE WITH ASHES
WE ARE ALL OF US FINE SUMPTER ASSES AND ASSESSES
BUT THEY ARE THE REAPERS AND REJOICERS
I AM HAPPY TO SEE THE MARVELS THE WARM SUN HATCHETH
ETERNALLY RUNNETH ON THE YEAR OF EXISTENCE
YE MUST BE PROUD OF YOUR ENEMIES
WHO IS UNGODLIER THAN I THAT I MAY ENJOY HIS TEACHING THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND PENETRATED WITH HIS GLANCES THE THOUGHTS AND ARREAR-THOUGHTS OF THE OLD POPE
THE IDEAL OF A SPIRIT WHO PLAYS NAIVELY THAT IS TO SAY INVOLUNTARILY AND FROM OVERFLOWING ABUNDANCE AND POWER WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAS HITHERTO BEEN CALLED HOLY GOOD INTANGIBLE OR DIVINE
THERE APPROACHETH THERE APPROACHETH THE HOUR THERE BOOMETH THE CLOCK-BELL THERE THRILLETH STILL THE HEART THERE BURROWETH STILL THE WOOD-WORM THE HEART-WORM
ALL BOUNDARY-STONES AND STATUES HAVE I O'ERTHROWN
THEY HAVE HEAVY FEET AND SULTRY HEARTS:--THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DANCE
THEY DEVOUR ONE ANOTHER AND CANNOT EVEN DIGEST THEMSELVES
XLVII
XLVII
HE THREW HIS BALL
THAT CAUSETH WHOLESOME WEARINESS AND IS POPPY TO THE SOUL
THE TERRIBLE TEACHER OF GREAT CONTEMPT WHICH PREACHETH TO THEIR FACE TO CITIES AND EMPIRES
WHEN HOWEVER HE HAD THEREBY COME TO THE DOOR OF HIS CAVE LO THEN HAD HE AGAIN A LONGING FOR THE GOOD AIR OUTSIDE AND FOR HIS ANIMALS,--AND WISHED TO STEAL OUT
AND I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO LIVE IF I WERE NOT A SEER OF WHAT IS TO COME
ART THOU A TYRANT
AND VERILY WITH MINE OWN BLOOD HAVE I INCREASED MINE OWN KNOWLEDGE AS THE EVIDENCE INDICATETH BROKE IN ZARATHUSTRA
VERILY THE REELING SICKNESS DO I CALL IT TO CONJECTURE SUCH A THING
THE THOU HATH BEEN CONSECRATED BUT NOT YET THE I
THEY PUNISH THEE FOR ALL THY VIRTUES
SOMETHING WHISKETH OVER IT ITS HAPPINESS LAUGHETH
FOR THE HIGHEST MAN SHALL ALSO BE THE HIGHEST LORD ON EARTH
THEY HAVE THEIR LITTLE PLEASURES FOR THE DAY AND THEIR LITTLE PLEASURES FOR THE NIGHT BUT THEY HAVE A REGARD FOR HEALTH
A BLESSER HAVE I BECOME AND A YEA-SAYER
HE SPEAKETH NOT
THEY GREW OUT OF THY PASSIONS
MARRED IS LIFE BY THE MANY-TOO-MANY
THOU GREAT STAR SPAKE HE AS HE HAD SPOKEN ONCE BEFORE THOU DEEP EYE OF HAPPINESS WHAT WOULD BE ALL THY HAPPINESS IF THOU HADST NOT THOSE FOR WHOM THOU SHINEST
WITH HIM MAN CAME OF AGE

TO EACH SOUL BELONGETH ANOTHER WORLD
AND ALSO THE LEARNING SHALL YE LEARN ONLY FROM ME THE LEARNING WELL!--HE WHO HATH EARS LET HIM HEAR
LET US BE GOOD AGAIN AND OF GOOD CHEER
MY HORROR MY HATRED MY LOATHING MY PITY ALL MY GOOD AND MY BAD CRIED WITH ONE VOICE OUT OF ME YE DARING ONES AROUND ME
MUST ONE THEN CURSE IMMEDIATELY WHEN ONE DOTH NOT LOVE
THUS DOTH MY GREAT LOVE MAKE ME SPEAK
WHEN HOWEVER THIS TOOK PLACE WITH THE UGLIEST MAN ZARATHUSTRA STOOD THERE LIKE ONE DRUNKEN
AND WHAT IN THE WORLD HATH CAUSED MORE SUFFERING THAN THE FOLLIES OF THE PITIFUL
AND WHAT IN THE WORLD HATH CAUSED MORE SUFFERING THAN THE FOLLIES OF THE PITIFUL
THE REST HOWEVER ARE COWARDLY
AT THE MOST I REGARD THEE AS THE VENTRILOQUIST OF THE EARTH
ON THE OPEN HEIGHT WOULDST THOU BE
THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE
THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE
THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE
AND CERTAINLY DID MY FEET THEN TREMBLE
ON CROOKED COURSES LEARN MY FEET--CRAFTY FANCIES
THE SAGE ASSUMING THAT THE SNAKE MUST HAVE CRAWLED INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S MOUTH WHILE HE LAY SLEEPING RUNS TO HIS HELP AND PULLS AT THE LOATHSOME REPTILE WITH ALL HIS MIGHT BUT IN VAIN
FOR IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS WRITTEN IN 1887 HE FINDS IT NECESSARY TO REFER TO THE MATTER AGAIN AND WITH GREATER PRECISION
THOSE KINGS MAY WELL PUT ON A GOOD AIR BEFORE US STILL
OH ALL YE STRANGE ONES WHO HAVE COME TO ME IT IS ALREADY WORTH WHILE TO HAVE LIVED WITH ME THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
LV
LV
THIS SUMMER FINDING MYSELF ONCE MORE IN THE SACRED PLACE WHERE THE FIRST THOUGHT OF ZARATHUSTRA FLASHED ACROSS MY MIND I CONCEIVED THE SECOND PART
AND IF HE SAY THAT HE ONCE KILLED HIM WITH GODS DEATH IS ALWAYS JUST A PREJUDICE AND THOU SAID ZARATHUSTRA THOU BAD OLD MAGICIAN WHAT DIDST THOU DO
TOILSOMELY DID MY SPIRIT MOUNT STAIRS AND CAUTIOUSLY
A FIRST MOTION
BUT IN THE CITIES DWELL THE WELL-FODDERED FAMOUS WISE ONES--THE DRAUGHT-BEASTS
NOW MUST THE GENTLEST IN THEE BECOME THE HARDEST
AND NOT TO HIM WHO IS OFFENSIVE TO US ARE WE MOST UNFAIR BUT TO HIM WHO DOTH NOT CONCERN US AT ALL
HE IS THEREFORE HIGHLY PLEASED THAT THE HIGHER MEN HAVE ALL BLOSSOMED FORTH
COME THOU COLD AND STIFF COMPANION
THOU ABYSS OF LIGHT!--BECAUSE THEY ROB THEE OF MY YEA AND AMEN
THUS MUST THOU MOUNT EVEN ABOVE THYSELF--UP UPWARDS UNTIL THOU HAST EVEN THY STARS UNDER THEE
AND WHEREVER THERE ARE CLOSETS THERE ARE NEW DEVOTEES THEREIN AND THE ATMOSPHERE OF DEVOTEES
TO WHOM WOULD I GO BUT UNTO THEE
TOWARDS MORNING HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA LAUGHED TO HIS HEART AND SAID MOCKINGLY
TOO TENDER TOO YIELDING
OR HATH EACH OF US DEVISED IT HIMSELF
UNATTAINABLE IS BEAUTY BY ALL ARDENT WILLS
NO ONE TELLETH ME ANYTHING NEW SO I TELL MYSELF MINE OWN STORY
THE DANCE-SONG
THE DANCE-SONG
SO THE MAN WHO SEES A MEANING AND A JOYFUL MEANING IN EXISTENCE MUST ALSO CRY AGAIN AND YET AGAIN TO ALL HIS LIFE
AM I THEN A DOG?"--AND THEREUPON THE SITTING ONE GOT UP AND PULLED HIS NAKED ARM OUT OF THE SWAMP
I AM ASHAMED THEN WAS THERE AGAIN SPOKEN UNTO ME WITHOUT VOICE
NOW LIGHTNING-STRUCK BY THEE THOU MOCKING EYE THAT ME IN DARKNESS WATCHETH
THEY LOOK AT THIS LIFE WITH ILL-WILL THEY HAVE AN EVIL EYE FOR THIS EARTH
DO WE NOT EVER SIT AT A GREAT TABLE OF MOCKING AND PLAYING
BUT IN THE END HE DECLARES IN A NOTE ON THE SUBJECT I HAD TO DO A PERSIAN THE HONOUR OF IDENTIFYING HIM WITH THIS CREATURE OF MY FANCY
LIKE THYSELF THE STATE IS A DISSEMBLING DOG
THE ONLY ONE TO RESIST THE MELANCHOLY VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF HIS ART IS THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE--THE SCIENTIFIC SPECIALIST OF WHOM WE READ IN THE DISCOURSE ENTITLED THE LEECH HE TAKES THE HARP FROM THE MAGICIAN AND CRIES FOR AIR WHILE REPROVING THE MUSICIAN IN THE STYLE OF THE CASE OF WAGNER WHEN THE MAGICIAN RETALIATES BY SAYING THAT THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE COULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD LITTLE OF HIS SONG THE LATTER REPLIES
AND WHATEVER HARM THE WICKED MAY DO THE HARM OF THE GOOD IS THE HARMFULEST HARM
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER SEIZED THE HAND OF THE OLD POPE AND REGARDED IT A LONG WHILE WITH ADMIRATION
TO FATHOM THIS MYSTERY DID I GO O'ER THE SEA
VIRTUE--THAT IS TO SIT QUIETLY IN THE SWAMP
OH HOW MANY SEAS ROUND ABOUT ME WHAT DAWNING HUMAN FUTURES
JUST MOTLEY SPEAKING FROM MASK OF FOOL CONFUSEDLY SHOUTING CIRCUMAMBLING ON FABRICATED WORD-BRIDGES ON MOTLEY RAINBOW-ARCHES TWIXT THE SPURIOUS HEAVENLY AND SPURIOUS EARTHLY ROUND US ROVING ROUND US SOARING MERE FOOL
ON AN ISLE THEY ONCE THOUGHT THEY HAD LANDED WHEN THE SEA TOSSED THEM ABOUT
IN DYING WILL I GIVE THEM MY CHOICEST GIFT
OH THAT SOME ONE WOULD SAVE THEM FROM THEIR SAVIOUR
O MY BRETHREN A FRESH BLUSTERING WIND COMETH ZARATHUSTRA UNTO ALL WAY-WEARY ONES
THIS THIS IS MY DECLIVITY AND MY DANGER THAT MY GAZE SHOOTETH TOWARDS THE SUMMIT AND MY HAND WOULD FAIN CLUTCH AND LEAN--ON THE DEPTH
HOW IT LAUGHETH IN ITS DREAM
HOW IT LAUGHETH IN ITS DREAM
THRICE DID THERE PEAL PEALS AT THE GATE LIKE THUNDERS THRICE DID THE VAULTS RESOUND AND HOWL AGAIN
FOR EVERY ONE DID I STILL FIND POOR IN SPIRIT
WHAT IS BEAUTY AND SEA AND PEACOCK-SPLENDOUR TO IT
MY GUESTS YE HIGHER MEN I WILL SPEAK PLAIN LANGUAGE AND PLAINLY WITH YOU
CERTAIN IT IS HOWEVER THAT GOD SEEMETH TO ME MOST WORTHY OF BELIEF IN THIS FORM
WHAT A SPECTACLE AWAITED HIM AFTER THAT CONCERT
THAT HAVE I NOW LEARNED
AGAIN AND AGAIN OF COURSE HE WILL BE FOUND TO EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CLEARLY THAT ALL REFERENCE TO HIS OTHER WRITINGS MAY BE DISPENSED WITH
TOUCH ME NOT
NOTHING FALLETH ANY LONGER INTO DEEP WELLS
WERT THOU NOT DISMAYED AT THY FRIEND LOOKING SO
OTHERWISE IT WILL SPOIL MY REPUTATION AND ONCE MORE ZARATHUSTRA SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WONDERED
IT WANTETH ITSELF IT BITETH INTO ITSELF THE RING'S WILL WRITHETH IN IT IT WANTETH LOVE IT WANTETH HATE IT IS OVER-RICH IT BESTOWETH IT THROWETH AWAY IT BEGGETH FOR SOME ONE TO TAKE FROM IT IT THANKETH THE TAKER IT WOULD FAIN BE HATED SO RICH IS JOY THAT IT THIRSTETH FOR WOE FOR HELL FOR HATE FOR SHAME FOR THE LAME FOR THE WORLD,--FOR THIS WORLD OH YE KNOW IT INDEED
I HOWEVER REJOICE IN GREAT SIN AS MY GREAT CONSOLATION SUCH THINGS HOWEVER ARE NOT SAID FOR LONG EARS
FOR HE IS WILLING TO SUCCUMB THROUGH THE PRESENT ONES
IT IS HOWEVER THE SMALLEST THING UNTO ME SINCE I HAVE BEEN AMONGST MEN TO SEE ONE PERSON LACKING AN EYE ANOTHER AN EAR AND A THIRD A LEG AND THAT OTHERS HAVE LOST THE TONGUE OR THE NOSE OR THE HEAD
THEREBY THEY ARE THE MORE LIKE HARD MOLLUSCS
BUT SO DID I WILL IT
ALL GREAT LOVE IS ABOVE ALL ITS PITY
THOSE WHO CAN READ GERMAN WILL FIND AN EXCELLENT GUIDE IN THIS RESPECT IN FRAU FOERSTER-NIETZSCHE'S EXHAUSTIVE AND HIGHLY INTERESTING BIOGRAPHY OF HER BROTHER
IT PERSUADETH TO DEATH
I LEARNED TO WALK
IT IS YOUR DEAREST SELF YOUR VIRTUE
I LOVE YOU MINE ANIMALS THE EAGLE HOWEVER AND THE SERPENT PRESSED CLOSE TO HIM WHEN HE SPAKE THESE WORDS AND LOOKED UP TO HIM
HE--OF TRUTH THE WOOER
IT IS A DISCOURSE AGAINST ALL THOSE WHO CONFOUND VIRTUE WITH TAMENESS AND SMUG EASE AND WHO REGARD AS VIRTUOUS ONLY THAT WHICH PROMOTES SECURITY AND TENDS TO DEEPEN SLEEP
THE EARTH SAID HE HATH A SKIN
YEA IF YE SHOULD YE BEAUTEOUS FRIENDLY ONES QUITE TAKE MY WORD
AND ALTHOUGH ZARATHUSTRA LOOKETH WITH EVIL EYE--JUST SEE HIM
IT IS THE GOOD WAR WHICH HALLOWETH EVERY CAUSE SEE ALSO PAR
THIS ALONE TAUGHT I THEM TO CALL REDEMPTION NOW DO I AWAIT MY REDEMPTION--THAT I MAY GO UNTO THEM FOR THE LAST TIME
AND HOW COULD I ENDURE TO DIE AT PRESENT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
NEW PATHS DO I TREAD A NEW SPEECH COMETH UNTO ME
ALL DAYS SHALL BE HOLY UNTO ME"--SO SPAKE ONCE THE WISDOM OF MY YOUTH
OUT OF THY POISONS BREWEDST THOU BALSAM FOR THYSELF
IN THEIR WISDOM THERE IS OFTEN AN ODOUR AS IF IT CAME FROM THE SWAMP
HE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED STROKED HIS BEARD AND SAID WITH A STRONG VOICE
O PURE ODOURS AROUND ME
O PURE ODOURS AROUND ME
ALREADY HAVE I DIED
THEY THINK MUCH ABOUT THEE WITH THEIR CIRCUMSCRIBED SOULS--THOU ART ALWAYS SUSPECTED BY THEM
THESE MOUNTAINS SWARM
FOR BEHOLD O ZARATHUSTRA
THUS DO THEY MAKE THE HOSE OF THE SPIRIT
BUT THE LOVING ONE LOVETH IRRESPECTIVE OF REWARD AND REQUITAL
HERE SHALL NO ONE STEAL AFTER THEE
OUR BEST IS STILL YOUNG
AND AS LONG AS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE IS FOR THE HERD THE BAD CONSCIENCE ONLY SAITH
IN MY HEART DO I LOVE ONLY LIFE--AND VERILY MOST WHEN I HATE HER
TO DESPISE THE EARTHLY HATH YOUR SPIRIT BEEN PERSUADED BUT NOT YOUR BOWELS
ZARATHUSTRA THE DANCER ZARATHUSTRA THE LIGHT ONE WHO BECKONETH WITH HIS PINIONS ONE READY FOR FLIGHT BECKONING UNTO ALL BIRDS READY AND PREPARED A BLISSFULLY LIGHT-SPIRITED ONE ZARATHUSTRA THE SOOTHSAYER ZARATHUSTRA THE SOOTH-LAUGHER NO IMPATIENT ONE NO ABSOLUTE ONE ONE WHO LOVETH LEAPS AND SIDE-LEAPS
SO IS THE STONE WHICH IT CANNOT ROLL CALLED
TARRY YET A LITTLE AND HEARKEN UNTO ME
TO BE SURE THEY ALSO LEARN IN THEIR WAY TO STRIDE ON AND STRIDE FORWARD
MADNESS I CALL THIS
IT DIVINETH WHERE ASCENDING SOULS ARE WEARY IN YOUR TROUBLE AND DEJECTION IN YOUR SENSITIVE MODESTY DOTH IT BUILD ITS LOATHSOME NEST
THE HOUR HATH NOW COME FOR THE DOWN-GOER TO BLESS HIMSELF
TO HUNT HIM OUT OF HIS LAIR--THAT WAS ALWAYS CALLED SENSE OF RIGHT BY THE PEOPLE
LET HIM GO SAID ZARATHUSTRA AFTER PROLONGED MEDITATION STILL LOOKING THE OLD MAN STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
LET ME RUN AFTER IT
LIKE THE LOVER AM I WHO DISTRUSTETH TOO SLEEK SMILING
FOR AT THIS POINT THE SHOUTING AND MIRTH OF THE MULTITUDE INTERRUPTED HIM
YE ARE TOO PURE FOR THE FILTH OF THE WORDS
THE FORMER SEEMS TO BE MUCH THE MORE IMPORTANT THE ITALICS ARE MINE FOR NEARLY SIMILAR VARIATIONS SOMETIMES ARISE UNDER AS FAR AS WE CAN JUDGE DISSIMILAR CONDITIONS
AND WHEN I TALKED FACE TO FACE WITH MY WILD WISDOM SHE SAID TO ME ANGRILY
THE BIOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL GROUNDS FOR HIS INSISTENCE UPON THIS PRINCIPLE ARE OF COURSE MANIFOLD
AND HE WHO CANNOT BLESS SHALL LEARN TO CURSE!"--THIS CLEAR TEACHING DROPT UNTO ME FROM THE CLEAR HEAVEN
IT WAS TO SAVE THIS MAN THAT NIETZSCHE WROTE
BUT WHO COULD DRINK ALL THE BITTERNESS OF THIS CONJECTURE WITHOUT DYING
THIS IS MY DOUBT OF YOU AND MY SECRET LAUGHTER
THE GRAVE-SONG
THE GRAVE-SONG
THE GRAVE-SONG
OR EVIL EXPECTATIONS
I SEE AND HAVE SEEN WORSE THINGS AND DIVERS THINGS SO HIDEOUS THAT I SHOULD NEITHER LIKE TO SPEAK OF ALL MATTERS NOR EVEN KEEP SILENT ABOUT SOME OF THEM
WHO LOV'TH ME STILL GIVE ARDENT FINGERS GIVE HEARTENING CHARCOAL-WARMERS GIVE ME THE LONESOMEST THE ICE AH
WHAT GOOD IS MY JUSTICE
AND EVERY PROPHET HAD HIS HAZAR,'--HIS DYNASTY OF A THOUSAND YEARS ALL ZARATHUSTRA'S VIEWS AS ALSO HIS PERSONALITY WERE EARLY CONCEPTIONS OF MY BROTHER'S MIND
ALL THINGS SEPARATE ALL THINGS AGAIN GREET ONE ANOTHER
OR ELSE THEY GRASP AT SWEETMEATS AND MOCK AT THEIR CHILDISHNESS THEREBY
I TELL YOU
I TELL YOU
HIS ANIMALS HOWEVER PRESSED UP TO HIM AND HONOURED HIS HAPPINESS AND HIS SILENCE
FOR HOW LONG A TIME
FOR WHERE THE WORST OF ALL TREES GREW--THE CROSS,--IN THAT LAND THERE IS NOTHING TO PRAISE AND VERILY WHEREVER THIS HOLY SPIRIT LED ITS KNIGHTS ALWAYS IN SUCH CAMPAIGNS DID--GOATS AND GEESE AND WRYHEADS AND GUYHEADS RUN FOREMOST O MY BRETHREN NOT BACKWARD SHALL YOUR NOBILITY GAZE BUT OUTWARD
ESPECIALLY THE HUMAN WORLD THE HUMAN SEA:--TOWARDS IT DO I NOW THROW OUT MY GOLDEN ANGLE-ROD AND SAY
L
L
WHO WARM'TH ME WHO LOV'TH ME STILL
I LAY HOWEVER ON THE GROUND AND THE SWEAT FLOWED FROM MY LIMBS
THUS WOULD I HAVE MAN AND WOMAN
HATH NOT ALL SUCCESS HITHERTO BEEN WITH THE WELL-PERSECUTED ONES
AND THE SPIRIT--WHAT IS IT TO THE BODY
ZARATHUSTRA CALLS THE UGLIEST MAN THE MURDERER OF GOD
I HAVE SPOKEN MY WORD
WITH THE SECOND THE SLAVE-MORALITY THE CASE IS DIFFERENT
FOR THEY HAD ALL SEEN HIM BEFORE EXCEPT THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF AND THEY LOVED HIM AS THE PEOPLE LOVE
WANT WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BRING THIS STRUGGLE ABOUT IS NOT SO COMMON AS IS SUPPOSED
O ZARATHUSTRA THY FRUITS ARE RIPE BUT THOU ART NOT RIPE FOR THY FRUITS
THEY ARE COLD AND SEEK WARMTH FROM DISTILLED WATERS
THE MAN WITH OVERFLOWING STRENGTH BOTH OF MIND AND BODY WHO MUST DISCHARGE THIS STRENGTH OR PERISH IS THE NIETZSCHEAN IDEAL
AND THE SERPENT OF ETERNITY LIES COILED IN ITS LIGHT
LET US NOW WANDER
THEREBY WENT HE HIS WAY TO GREATNESS
THIS DISCOURSE IS VERY IMPORTANT
THE LAST MAN LIVETH LONGEST
BUT WELL DO I KNOW MY VALLEYS THEN WAS THERE AGAIN SPOKEN UNTO ME WITHOUT VOICE
TO YOU THROW I THE GOLDEN BALL
BUT A STRONGER POWER GROWETH OUT OF YOUR VALUES AND A NEW SURPASSING
WHOEVER IS ABLE TO GRASP ME MAY GRASP ME
WHOEVER IS ABLE TO GRASP ME MAY GRASP ME
WE HAVE AGAIN BECOME PIOUS"--SO DO THOSE APOSTATES CONFESS
WHAT IS A STAR?"--SO ASKETH THE LAST MAN AND BLINKETH
THEY PARDON THEE IN THEIR INMOST HEARTS ONLY--FOR THINE ERRORS
BUT YE DO NOT DIVINE WHAT MAKETH MY HEART WANTON YE YOURSELVES DO IT AND YOUR ASPECT FORGIVE IT ME
TARANTULAS ARE YE UNTO ME AND SECRETLY REVENGEFUL ONES
MADMEN THEY ALL SEEM TO ME AND CLAMBERING APES AND TOO EAGER
THUS IS ALL THE PAST ABANDONED
WHENCE HAVE GONE THE TEARS OF MINE EYE AND THE DOWN OF MY HEART
THERE HATH SURELY A GOD FILCHED SOMETHING FROM ME SECRETLY WHILST I SLEPT

THAT IS YOUR ENTIRE WILL YE WISEST ONES AS A WILL TO POWER
AND FORSOOTH
A GOD'S SOUL I ONCE THOUGHT I SAW PLAYING IN YOUR GAMES YE PURE DISCERNERS
WHAT DOTH IT COME TO
I FORM CIRCLES AROUND ME AND HOLY BOUNDARIES
THE PROUDEST ANIMAL UNDER THE SUN AND THE WISEST ANIMAL UNDER THE SUN,--THEY HAVE COME OUT TO RECONNOITRE
WE HAVE DISCOVERED HAPPINESS,"--SAY THE LAST MEN AND BLINK THEREBY AND HERE ENDED THE FIRST DISCOURSE OF ZARATHUSTRA WHICH IS ALSO CALLED THE PROLOGUE
I HELD A PAIR OF SCALES AND WEIGHED THE WORLD
HATH HE THEN CHILDREN
AMAZING IS THE POVERTY OF MY RIBS THUS HATH SPOKEN MANY A PRESENT-DAY MAN
HOW THE SPIRIT BECOMETH A CAMEL THE CAMEL A LION AND THE LION AT LAST A CHILD
YE SEEM TO ME LUKEWARM ONES
I WILL NOT THEN DID A LAUGHING TAKE PLACE ALL AROUND ME
THEN WILL I BE WITH YOU FOR THE THIRD TIME TO CELEBRATE THE GREAT NOONTIDE WITH YOU
IT OPENED UP JUST YAWNING ITS LOVELIEST MOUTH AGAPE MOST SWEET-ODOURED OF ALL MOUTHLETS
ZARATHUSTRA SHALL NOT BE THE HERD'S HERDSMAN AND HOUND
ALL IS IN FLUX BUT EVEN THE SIMPLETONS CONTRADICT HIM
FORWARD AND BACKWARD DO I GAZE STILL SEE I NO END
THOU LIGHTNING-VEILED ONE
BUT WHAT MATTER ABOUT THAT
EGO SAYEST THOU AND ART PROUD OF THAT WORD
IF THOU SPEAKEST THE TRUTH SAID HE I LOSE NOTHING WHEN I LOSE MY LIFE
THUS IMPELLETH IT THE HAMMER TO THE STONE
EVERYTHING OF TO-DAY--IT FALLETH IT DECAYETH
XXV

UNTIL AT LAST THOU ALONE SATTEST THIRSTY AMONGST THE DRUNKEN ONES AND WAILEDST NIGHTLY
THEIR EYE SAITH IT--THEY KNOW NOTHING BETTER ON EARTH THAN TO LIE WITH A WOMAN
HE WHO CAN REGARD HIS WORST CALAMITY AS BUT THE EXTRA STRAIN ON THE BOW OF HIS LIFE WHICH IS TO SEND THE ARROW OF HIS LONGING EVEN FURTHER THAN HE COULD HAVE HOPED;--THIS MAN KNOWS NO REVENGE NEITHER DOES HE KNOW DESPAIR HE TRULY HAS FOUND REDEMPTION AND CAN TURN ON THE WORST IN HIS LIFE AND EVEN IN HIMSELF AND CALL IT HIS BEST SEE NOTES ON CHAPTER LVII CHAPTER XLIII
HATH IT ALREADY WANDERED TOO LONG BLISSFULLY AMONG GOOD AND RIPE THINGS
AH MY FRIENDS
YE EMBITTERED TO ME MY BEST HONEY AND THE DILIGENCE OF MY BEST BEES
NOT WHEEZE SHALT THOU,--BUT SPEAK UNTO ME
AND ONE SHALL ALSO HELP THEM THERETO NIETZSCHE PARTLY DIVINED THE KIND OF RECEPTION MORAL VALUES OF THIS STAMP WOULD MEET WITH AT THE HANDS OF THE EFFEMINATE MANHOOD OF EUROPE
ONE MORNING NOT LONG AFTER HIS RETURN TO HIS CAVE ZARATHUSTRA SPRANG UP FROM HIS COUCH LIKE A MADMAN CRYING WITH A FRIGHTFUL VOICE AND ACTING AS IF SOME ONE STILL LAY ON THE COUCH WHO DID NOT WISH TO RISE
SOME GOD IN THEE HATH CONVERTED THEE TO THINE UNGODLINESS
BUT HE WHO HAD TO CREATE HAD ALWAYS HIS PRESAGING DREAMS AND ASTRAL PREMONITIONS--AND BELIEVED IN BELIEVING HALF-OPEN DOORS ARE YE AT WHICH GRAVE-DIGGERS WAIT
BEFORE WHOSE GLANCE MAN CREEPETH AND CROUCHETH AND DRUDGETH AND BECOMETH LOWER THAN THE SERPENT AND THE SWINE:--UNTIL AT LAST GREAT CONTEMPT CRIETH OUT OF HIM PASSION FOR POWER
GOOD FOR ALL EVIL FOR ALL VERILY NEITHER DO I LIKE THOSE WHO CALL EVERYTHING GOOD AND THIS WORLD THE BEST OF ALL
LIKE A SOUNDING-LEAD CAST I THIS QUESTION INTO THY SOUL THAT I MAY KNOW ITS DEPTH
MUST THERE NOT FOR THE SAKE OF THE NIMBLE THE NIMBLEST,--BE MOLES AND CLUMSY DWARFS 3
O THOU MY HAPPINESS BEFORE SUNRISE
VERILY A NEW GOOD AND EVIL IS IT
DID PERHAPS A SILLY CHILD TAKE THEM OUT OF ITS TOY-BOX
VERILY LIKE THE SUN DO I LOVE LIFE AND ALL DEEP SEAS
AS SOON AS THE MAIDENS RECOGNISED ZARATHUSTRA THEY CEASED DANCING
BUT THOU KNOWEST IT WELL--I SOUGHT FOR GREATNESS
HOW COULD THE EARTH BE LIGHT TO SUCH ONES
THEREFORE WANTETH HE WOMAN AS THE MOST DANGEROUS PLAYTHING
TO THE LONE-DWELLERS WILL I SING MY SONG AND TO THE TWAIN-DWELLERS
WITH YOU I SHOULD SPOIL ALL MY VICTORIES
THOSE YOUNG HEARTS HAVE ALREADY ALL BECOME OLD--AND NOT OLD EVEN
BUT FOR ME--YE ARE NEITHER HIGH ENOUGH NOR STRONG ENOUGH
I SUSPECT YE WOULD CALL MY SUPERMAN--A DEVIL
THUS SAITH THE FOOL
GENTLY VIBRATED AND LAUGHED UNTO ME TO-DAY MY BUCKLER
HIS QUARREL IS NOT WITH WOMEN--WHAT INDEED COULD BE MORE UNDIGNIFIED?--IT IS WITH THOSE WHO WOULD DESTROY THE NATURAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SEXES BY MODIFYING EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER WITH A VIEW TO MAKING THEM MORE ALIKE
MY MOST CREATIVE MOMENTS WERE ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY UNUSUAL MUSCULAR ACTIVITY
NIETZSCHE LAYS STRESS UPON THE FACT THAT ALL HAPPINESS ALL DELIGHT LONGS FOR REPETITIONS AND JUST AS A CHILD CRIES AGAIN
NOW HOWEVER DO I LIE HERE STILL EXHAUSTED WITH THAT BITING AND SPITTING-AWAY STILL SICK WITH MINE OWN SALVATION
BUT I SAY
TO SIT ON HIGH MASTS OF PERCEPTION SEEMED TO ME NO SMALL BLISS TO FLICKER LIKE SMALL FLAMES ON HIGH MASTS
THE BESTOWING VIRTUE
THE BESTOWING VIRTUE
THE BESTOWING VIRTUE
NOT MURDER WILT THOU BUT TORTURE TORTURE
FOR BEHOLD THERE SAT A MAN ON THE GROUND WHO SEEMED TO BE PERSUADING THE ANIMALS TO HAVE NO FEAR OF HIM A PEACEABLE MAN AND PREACHER-ON-THE-MOUNT OUT OF WHOSE EYES KINDNESS ITSELF PREACHED
THEY ALL MUDDLE THEIR WATER THAT IT MAY SEEM DEEP
THUS DOTH THE GREATEST EVIL PERTAIN TO THE GREATEST GOOD
IT IS A PROTEST AGAINST READING A MORAL ORDER OF THINGS IN LIFE
THUS DID HE STAND THE SUBLIME ONE AND IN SILENCE
NIETZSCHE AS A SOCIOLOGIST AIMS AT AN ARISTOCRATIC ARRANGEMENT OF SOCIETY
HERE ON THE LOFTIEST HEIGHT BUBBLETH UP FOR ME THE WELL OF DELIGHT
THOSE DINGY FIRE-WARMED USED-UP GREEN-TINTED ILL-NATURED SOULS--HOW COULD THEIR ENVY ENDURE MY HAPPINESS
ONE VIRTUE IS MORE OF A VIRTUE THAN TWO BECAUSE IT IS MORE OF A KNOT FOR ONE'S DESTINY TO CLING TO
A HUNGER ARISETH OUT OF MY BEAUTY
I A--CREEPER
POWER IS IT THIS NEW VIRTUE
TO BE GOOD IS WHAT IS PRETTY AND AT THE SAME TIME TOUCHING THEY CALL YOU HEARTLESS
AND VERILY LONG MUST HE HANG LIKE A HEAVY TEMPEST ON THE MOUNTAIN WHO SHALL ONE DAY KINDLE THE LIGHT OF THE FUTURE OH HOW COULD I NOT BE ARDENT FOR ETERNITY AND FOR THE MARRIAGE-RING OF RINGS--THE RING OF THE RETURN
A FOOL WHO SEEKETH KNOWLEDGE FROM THEM
IT IS MINE ENVY OF THEE THAT HATH DESTROYED ME!"--THUS SPAKE THE YOUTH AND WEPT BITTERLY
LIKE A CRY AND AN HUZZA WILL I TRAVERSE WIDE SEAS TILL I FIND THE HAPPY ISLES WHERE MY FRIENDS SOJOURN AND MINE ENEMIES AMONGST THEM
HEAVY UNTO HIM ARE EARTH AND LIFE AND SO WILLETH THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY
GOOD AND EVIL THEMSELVES HOWEVER ARE BUT FUGITIVE SHADOWS AND DAMP AFFLICTIONS AND PASSING CLOUDS
THUS GOETH HE WILLINGLY OVER THE BRIDGE
THIS FREEDOM AND CELESTIAL SERENITY DID I PUT LIKE AN AZURE BELL ABOVE ALL THINGS WHEN I TAUGHT THAT OVER THEM AND THROUGH THEM NO ETERNAL WILL"--WILLETH
WELL THEN UP YE OLD LEGS
GOOD AND EVIL AND JOY AND WOE AND I AND THOU--COLOURED VAPOURS DID THEY SEEM TO ME BEFORE CREATIVE EYES
WHEN IT GOT ABROAD AMONG THE SAILORS THAT ZARATHUSTRA WAS ON BOARD THE SHIP--FOR A MAN WHO CAME FROM THE HAPPY ISLES HAD GONE ON BOARD ALONG WITH HIM,--THERE WAS GREAT CURIOSITY AND EXPECTATION
THOU WILLEST THOU CRAVEST THOU LOVEST
THOU PRAISEST ME IN THAT THOU SEPARATEST ME FROM THYSELF THE SPEECH OF THE SCIENTIFIC MAN TO HIS FELLOW HIGHER MEN IS WELL WORTH STUDYING
THAT IS BECAUSE I DO NOT RUN AFTER WOMEN
NEVER DOTH IT TIRE OF ITS LACE-FAN OF SILVER AND SILK
THIS PROVIDENCE IS OVER MY FATE THAT I HAVE TO BE WITHOUT FORESIGHT
HOW LOVELY IS ALL SPEECH AND ALL FALSEHOODS OF TONES
I GO INTO THIS QUESTION THOROUGHLY IN THE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVII
AS SOON AS THE HIGHER MEN HEARD HIS QUESTION THEY BECAME ALL AT ONCE CONSCIOUS OF THEIR TRANSFORMATION AND CONVALESCENCE AND OF HIM WHO WAS THE CAUSE THEREOF
ADVERSE IS HE TO THY GARGLING AND SPEWING AND GRIPS IN THE BOWELS
I AM TOO PURE FOR THEE
AND THUS SPAKE THE OLD WOMAN
HE HAD NO DESIRE TO SAVE THE WORLD
AH THAT I WERE DARK AND NIGHTLY
THOU WOULDST SET THY CHAIR BETWIXT FOR AND AGAINST
AND WHO HATH TAUGHT IT RECONCILIATION WITH TIME AND SOMETHING HIGHER THAN ALL RECONCILIATION
10 11
10 11
SO THERE IS NOTHING LACKING BUT BREAD BREAD REPLIED ZARATHUSTRA LAUGHING WHEN HE SPAKE IT IS PRECISELY BREAD THAT ANCHORITES HAVE NOT
MORE LIKE SAVED ONES WOULD HIS DISCIPLES HAVE TO APPEAR UNTO ME
AH THIS SOMBRE SAD SEA BELOW ME
THOU TORTURER
DO I SPEAK OF FILTHY THINGS
VERILY MY FRIENDS I WALK AMONGST MEN AS AMONGST THE FRAGMENTS AND LIMBS OF HUMAN BEINGS
NOON-TIDE
BUT TO BE FORSAKEN IS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM DELIBERATELY CHOOSING BLESSED LONELINESS
ARISE NOW ARISE THOU GREAT NOONTIDE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND LEFT HIS CAVE GLOWING AND STRONG LIKE A MORNING SUN COMING OUT OF GLOOMY MOUNTAINS
SPIRIT HATH THE ACTOR BUT LITTLE CONSCIENCE OF THE SPIRIT
TO KNOW FIRST IF THY FRIEND WANTETH PITY
THEREFORE DO I TEAR AT YOUR WEB THAT YOUR RAGE MAY LURE YOU OUT OF YOUR DEN OF LIES AND THAT YOUR REVENGE MAY LEAP FORTH FROM BEHIND YOUR WORD JUSTICE BECAUSE FOR MAN TO BE REDEEMED FROM REVENGE--THAT IS FOR ME THE BRIDGE TO THE HIGHEST HOPE AND A RAINBOW AFTER LONG STORMS
FEAREST THOU NOT THE INCENDIARY'S DOOM
THAT I BADE THEE SING,--SAY NOW SAY
THE LATTER HOWEVER WHEN HE THUS SAW HIS RIVAL TRIUMPH LOST AT THE SAME TIME HIS HEAD AND HIS FOOTING ON THE ROPE
FOR THE CREATOR HIMSELF TO BE THE NEW-BORN CHILD HE MUST ALSO BE WILLING TO BE THE CHILD-BEARER AND ENDURE THE PANGS OF THE CHILD-BEARER
THE DREAM BEGAN
HE IS ONE OF THOSE AT WHOSE HANDS NIETZSCHE HAD TO SUFFER MOST DURING HIS LIFE-TIME AND AT WHOSE HANDS HIS PHILOSOPHY HAS SUFFERED MOST SINCE HIS DEATH
FOR THEM AM I RICH FOR THEM I BECAME POOR
I KNOW NOT YOU MEN
THAT I MIGHT NOT LIVE WITH THE POWER-RABBLE THE SCRIBE-RABBLE AND THE PLEASURE-RABBLE
THAT HOWEVER OF WHICH I AM MASTER AND KNOWER IS THE BRAIN OF THE LEECH:--THAT IS MY WORLD
THEY ARE NOT MY PROPER COMPANIONS
THERE ARE STILL HAPPY ISLES
THERE ARE THE SPIRITUALLY CONSUMPTIVE ONES
ALL THE HIDDEN ONES THE LONE-DWELLERS AND THE TWAIN-DWELLERS HAVE SIMULTANEOUSLY SAID TO THEIR HEARTS
MY COMPANION IS DEAD
AND NOW FOOLEST THOU ME FLEEING
THUS IS IT A SIMILE OF OUR BODY A SIMILE OF AN ELEVATION
WHAT FALLETH THAT SHALL ONE ALSO PUSH
THAT--SEEMETH TO ME BAD TASTE
AND WHAT COULD NOW FALL TO MY LOT WHICH WOULD NOT ALREADY BE MINE OWN
MUCH THAT PASSED FOR GOOD WITH ONE PEOPLE WAS REGARDED WITH SCORN AND CONTEMPT BY ANOTHER
THEIR MAINTAINMENT--THAT IS THEIR TRUE ENTERTAINMENT
COURAGE SLAYETH ALSO GIDDINESS AT ABYSSES
THEY EMPTY THEIR HEARTS GOOD TIMES RETURN UNTO THEM THEY KEEP HOLIDAY AND RUMINATE,--THEY BECOME THANKFUL
YEA AT YOU YE DEAREST ONES DID MALICE EVER SHOOT ITS ARROWS--TO HIT MY HEART
WELL THEN GOOD LUCK TO THE REPAST
HE SPRANG FROM THE POPULACE
O'ERHUNG WITH UGLY TRUTHS THE SPOIL OF HIS HUNTING AND RICH IN TORN RAIMENT
LET US BEWARE OF AWAKENING THOSE DEAD ONES AND OF DAMAGING THOSE LIVING COFFINS
HEALTH TO THEE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
THE LION IS NEEDED FOR THIS CAPTURE
THEN THERE CRIED OUT OF ME
NIGHT-WATCHMAN AND GRAVE-GUARDIAN HAD I BECOME ALOFT IN THE LONE MOUNTAIN-FORTRESS OF DEATH
THE GLOWING SCOURGE OF THE HARDEST OF THE HEART-HARD
OR TO MAIDENS FEET WITH FINE ANKLES
AH THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS BETWIXT HEAVEN AND EARTH OF WHICH ONLY THE POETS HAVE DREAMED
BUT EVERYTHING IMMATURE WANTETH TO LIVE
AT HIS FEET HOWEVER TWO LAMBS WERE STRETCHED WHICH THE EAGLE HAD WITH DIFFICULTY CARRIED OFF FROM THEIR SHEPHERDS
NOT A FEW WHO MEANT TO CAST OUT THEIR DEVIL WENT THEREBY INTO THE SWINE THEMSELVES
ALLURE FOR ME WITH THY GLITTERING THE FINEST HUMAN FISH
TOO OFT VERILY DID I FOLLOW CLOSE TO THE HEELS OF TRUTH
IS NOT SEEING ITSELF--SEEING ABYSSES
VERILY I HAVE DONE THIS AND THAT FOR THE AFFLICTED
WHAT WANTETH HE
WHAT WANTETH HE
AND THUS DID IT HAPPEN--FOR EVERYTHING MUST I TELL YOU THAT YOUR HEART MAY NOT HARDEN AGAINST THE SUDDENLY DEPARTING ONE
HE HOWEVER HATH DISCOVERED HIMSELF WHO SAITH
NEW DESIRES DID I AWAKEN
I KNOW THE HEART-BREAKING LAST HOURS
IT COMETH IT IS NIGH THE GREAT NOONTIDE
I SPARE YOU NOT I LOVE YOU FROM MY VERY HEART MY BRETHREN IN WAR THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
THE TIME HATH ARRIVED
THUS WILL THEY BE COMFORTED
A GLANCE AT THE CHAPTER-HEADINGS QUICKLY CONFIRMS THE SUSPICIONS ALREADY AROUSED AND THE SUB-TITLE
OH THE MISERY OF ALL BESTOWERS
MAY THE LORD IMPROVE IT
MAY THE LORD IMPROVE IT
FOR NOTHING IS MORE PRECIOUS TO ME AND RARER THAN HONESTY
AND THIS IS YOUR REALITY
THE WILL ITSELF IS STILL A PRISONER
CHAPTER LXXVII
EVEN THE SEA SLEEPETH
A THOUSAND PATHS ARE THERE WHICH HAVE NEVER YET BEEN TRODDEN
WE HAVE BECOME MEN,--SO WE WANT THE KINGDOM OF EARTH 3
AND WHO IS IT THAT THERE CALLETH ME BUT THOU KNOWEST IT CERTAINLY ANSWERED THE SOOTHSAYER WARMLY WHY DOST THOU CONCEAL THYSELF
THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN ZARATHUSTRA AND THE MAGICIAN REVEALS PRETTY FULLY WHAT IT WAS THAT NIETZSCHE GREW TO LOATHE SO INTENSELY IN WAGNER,--VIZ HIS PRONOUNCED HISTRIONIC TENDENCIES HIS DISSEMBLING POWERS HIS INORDINATE VANITY HIS EQUIVOCALNESS HIS FALSENESS
BUT IF YE WILL SPEAK THERE VERY WELL
WHO CAN TELL TO WHAT GLORIOUS HEIGHTS MAN CAN STILL ASCEND
SO I WENT AT LAST TO THE ANIMALS AND TO THOSE KINE THEN LEARNEDST THOU INTERRUPTED ZARATHUSTRA HOW MUCH HARDER IT IS TO GIVE PROPERLY THAN TO TAKE PROPERLY AND THAT BESTOWING WELL IS AN ART--THE LAST SUBTLEST MASTER-ART OF KINDNESS ESPECIALLY NOWADAYS ANSWERED THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR
WHERE WAS NOW THE DWARF
THE CHEEKS OF THE PENITENT OF THE SPIRIT BECAME PALE
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD SPOKEN THUS UNTO THE HUNCHBACK AND UNTO THOSE OF WHOM THE HUNCHBACK WAS THE MOUTHPIECE AND ADVOCATE THEN DID HE TURN TO HIS DISCIPLES IN PROFOUND DEJECTION AND SAID
AS A WANDERER WHO DREAMETH OF REMOTE THINGS ON A LONESOME HIGHWAY RUNNETH UNAWARES AGAINST A SLEEPING DOG A DOG WHICH LIETH IN THE SUN
HAD HE PERHAPS CHASED BUTTERFLIES TOO MUCH
ALL THAT WOULD ILL ACCORD WITH GOOD SLEEP
FALSE IS EVERYTHING IN IT
THOSE SHIPS TOOK MANY PEOPLE WITH THEM WHO WISHED TO CROSS OVER FROM THE HAPPY ISLES
BUT WHAT DID ZARATHUSTRA ONCE SAY UNTO THEE
OR A FULFILLER
AWAY FROM THEE DID I SPRING AND FROM THY SNAKY TRESSES
AND YE ALSO ASKED YOURSELVES OFTEN
AND MANY INTERNAL THINGS IN MAN ARE LIKE THE OYSTER--REPULSIVE AND SLIPPERY AND HARD TO GRASP SO THAT AN ELEGANT SHELL WITH ELEGANT ADORNMENT MUST PLEAD FOR THEM
HOW THE MIDNIGHT SIGHETH
CHASTITY
CHASTITY
AFRIC MANNER SOLEMNLY
CREATORS WERE THEY WHO CREATED PEOPLES AND HUNG A FAITH AND A LOVE OVER THEM
THE BADLY PAIRED FOUND I EVER THE MOST REVENGEFUL
AND WHOEVER CALLETH OUT
THY RULING THOUGHT WOULD I HEAR OF AND NOT THAT THOU HAST ESCAPED FROM A YOKE
THEY TELL ME THAT MAN LOVETH HIMSELF
SO THAT ZARATHUSTRA WENT ROUND AND MISCHIEVOUSLY AND LOVINGLY SHOOK HANDS WITH HIS FRIENDS,--LIKE ONE WHO HATH TO MAKE AMENDS AND APOLOGISE TO EVERY ONE FOR SOMETHING
WAGNER IN BAYREUTH ENGLISH EDITION 1909 GIVES US THE BEST PROOF OF NIETZSCHE'S INFATUATION AND ALTHOUGH SIGNS ARE NOT WANTING IN THIS ESSAY WHICH SHOW HOW CLEARLY AND EVEN CRUELLY HE WAS SUB-CONSCIOUSLY TAKING STOCK OF HIS FRIEND--EVEN THEN THE WORK IS A RECORD OF WHAT GREAT LOVE AND ADMIRATION CAN DO IN THE WAY OF ENDOWING THE OBJECT OF ONE'S AFFECTION WITH ALL THE QUALITIES AND IDEALS THAT A FERTILE IMAGINATION CAN CONCEIVE
FOR HOW LONG AFTER SUCH A SLEEP MAYEST THOU--REMAIN AWAKE BUT THEN DID HE FALL ASLEEP ANEW AND HIS SOUL SPAKE AGAINST HIM AND DEFENDED ITSELF AND LAY DOWN AGAIN)--"LEAVE ME ALONE
IT IS THE HOUR
OUT OF THE DEEPEST MUST THE HIGHEST COME TO ITS HEIGHT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA ON THE RIDGE OF THE MOUNTAIN WHERE IT WAS COLD
BUT ON THAT ACCOUNT IT IS NONE THE LESS SURE UNTO ME WITH BOTH FEET STAND I SECURE ON THIS GROUND
TWO KINGS DO I SEE--AND ONLY ONE ASS THEREUPON THE TWO KINGS MADE A HALT
APPENDIX

AND ONCE AGAIN SHALL YE HAVE BECOME FRIENDS UNTO ME AND CHILDREN OF ONE HOPE
IF I HAVE SWUM PLAYFULLY IN PROFOUND LUMINOUS DISTANCES AND IF MY FREEDOM'S AVIAN WISDOM HATH COME TO ME THUS HOWEVER SPEAKETH AVIAN WISDOM:--"LO THERE IS NO ABOVE AND NO BELOW
I AM NOT MUCH MORE THAN AN ANIMAL WHICH HATH BEEN TAUGHT TO DANCE BY BLOWS AND SCANTY FARE NOT AT ALL SAID ZARATHUSTRA THOU HAST MADE DANGER THY CALLING
THE SHADOW
THE SHADOW
THE SHADOW
WRITTEN ALL OVER WITH THE CHARACTERS OF THE PAST AND THESE CHARACTERS ALSO PENCILLED OVER WITH NEW CHARACTERS--THUS HAVE YE CONCEALED YOURSELVES WELL FROM ALL DECIPHERERS
TOO FAR DID I FLY INTO THE FUTURE
DIVINE SHALL EVERYTHING BE UNTO ME THEN DID YE HAUNT ME WITH FOUL PHANTOMS
BUT NOT OUT OF THE SWAMP THEY CALL THEE MINE APE THOU FOAMING FOOL
HERE NIETZSCHE PERHAPS EXAGGERATES THE IMPORTANCE OF HEREDITY
THEREFORE WILL I BURY THEE WITH MINE OWN HANDS WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD SAID THIS THE DYING ONE DID NOT REPLY FURTHER
AND ZARATHUSTRA WENT THOUGHTFULLY ON FURTHER AND LOWER DOWN THROUGH FORESTS AND PAST MOORY BOTTOMS
WELL HAVE I HID THEE FROM THE WOLVES
BUT THE NONDESCRIPT GRASPED AT A CORNER OF HIS GARMENT AND BEGAN ANEW TO GURGLE AND SEEK FOR WORDS
OH HOW COULD I FAIL TO DIVINE ALL THE MODESTY OF THY SOUL
HOW COULD IT BE UNDONE BY THE PENALTY
WITH SINGING WEEPING LAUGHING AND MUMBLING DO I PRAISE THE GOD WHO IS MY GOD
ALL THOSE STERN WATCHERS SHALL MY WILL AND PURPOSE ELUDE
HERDSMEN I SAY BUT THEY CALL THEMSELVES THE GOOD AND JUST
EVEN BEFORE THE UGLIEST OF ALL BUFFALOES DOTH IT SPREAD OUT ITS TAIL
WE ARE SOREST BENT AND TROUBLED BY INVISIBLE HANDS THEREUPON THE YOUTH AROSE DISCONCERTED AND SAID
LET MAN FEAR WOMAN WHEN SHE HATETH
THEREFORE CALLETH HE HIMSELF MAN THAT IS THE VALUATOR
IS HE A POET
BUT MY BRETHREN WHAT SMALL DOMAINS HAVE EVEN THE MOST SPACIOUS SOULS HITHERTO BEEN
WAR AND COURAGE HAVE DONE MORE GREAT THINGS THAN CHARITY
SO ARE CALLED THE PREACHERS OF DEATH OR THE BLACK ONES BUT I WILL SHOW THEM UNTO YOU IN OTHER COLOURS BESIDES
WOE SAITH
WOE SAITH
WOE SAITH
WOE SAITH
WOE SAITH
MY HAND HATH BECOME TOO HARD FOR THE TREMBLING OF FILLED HANDS
THESE ARE CONTINENT TO BE SURE
THEREFORE LIKETH HE WOMAN;--BITTER IS EVEN THE SWEETEST WOMAN
FIE TO STAND FOR THE FIRST MEN AMONG THE RABBLE
LIFT UP ALSO YOUR LEGS YE GOOD DANCERS AND BETTER STILL IF YE STAND UPON YOUR HEADS
LIFT UP ALSO YOUR LEGS YE GOOD DANCERS AND BETTER STILL IF YE STAND UPON YOUR HEADS
IN ALL THEIR LAMENTATIONS SOUNDETH VENGEANCE IN ALL THEIR EULOGIES IS MALEFICENCE
OR AT THE BEST COWS
I WILL BE--MASTER OVER PEOPLES FOR MY BRETHREN THE BEST SHALL RULE THE BEST ALSO WILLETH TO RULE
IS IT TRUE WHAT THEY SAY THAT SYMPATHY CHOKED HIM
A TESTING AND A QUESTIONING HATH BEEN ALL MY TRAVELLING:--AND VERILY ONE MUST ALSO LEARN TO ANSWER SUCH QUESTIONING
VIOLENTLY WILL MY BREAST THEN HEAVE
THEN THE SUCCESSES OF YOUR ENEMIES ARE ALSO YOUR SUCCESSES
OTHER SINGERS ARE THERE TO BE SURE TO WHOM ONLY THE FULL HOUSE MAKETH THE VOICE SOFT THE HAND ELOQUENT THE EYE EXPRESSIVE THE HEART WAKEFUL:--THOSE DO I NOT RESEMBLE 2
I SEE THEE STUNG ALL OVER BY THE POISONOUS FLIES
THE PRIESTS
THE PRIESTS
BLESS ME THEN THOU TRANQUIL EYE THAT CANST BEHOLD EVEN THE GREATEST HAPPINESS WITHOUT ENVY
THE FORMER SAYS IN HIS ORIGIN OF SPECIES CONCERNING THE CAUSES OF VARIABILITY
VERILY YE KNOW NOT THE SPIRIT'S PRIDE
HE WHO HATH ALWAYS MUCH-INDULGED HIMSELF SICKENETH AT LAST BY HIS MUCH-INDULGENCE
SORROWFULLY DID HE GO ABOUT AND WEARILY
12

WITH SOUND OF TRIUMPH HATH HE OVERCOME EVERY PAIN
THESE HOWEVER ARE THE STRONGEST IN YOU
AT LAST HE BECAME CALMER AND HIS PANTING SUBSIDED
AND THEY SHALL HAVE IT HARD
BUT TELL ME YE MEN WHO OF YOU ARE CAPABLE OF FRIENDSHIP
I SUGGEST THAT THE LAST VERSE IN THIS PARAGRAPH STRONGLY CONFIRMS THE VIEW THAT NIETZSCHE'S TEACHING WAS ALWAYS MEANT BY HIM TO BE ESOTERIC AND FOR HIGHER MAN ALONE
WHAT HE WISHED TO DETERMINE WAS
WHAT WAS HE THEN OBLIGED TO BEHOLD WITH HIS OWN EYES
FROM THE STONE FLY THE FRAGMENTS
MANY A ONE HATH CAST AWAY HIS FINAL WORTH WHEN HE HATH CAST AWAY HIS SERVITUDE
BEYOND THE SPHERE OF THEIR BODY AND THIS EARTH THEY NOW FANCIED THEMSELVES TRANSPORTED THESE UNGRATEFUL ONES
DRIPPING LEAD IN MINE EAR AND THOUGHTS LIKE DROPS OF LEAD INTO MY BRAIN
TEN
UNBIND THE FETTERS OF THINE EARS
LET THE FRIEND BE THE FESTIVAL OF THE EARTH TO YOU AND A FORETASTE OF THE SUPERMAN
A CHILD TOLD IT TO ME
IT IS ALL OVER
IT IS REALLY A COMMENT UPON THE BESTOWING VIRTUE SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER XXII PAR
SUCH THINGS DO WE ALSO THINK AMONG OURSELVES SAID THE KING ON THE RIGHT BUT WE DO NOT UTTER THEM THE KING ON THE LEFT HOWEVER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND ANSWERED
THY COW AFFLICTION MILKEDST THOU--NOW DRINKETH THOU THE SWEET MILK OF HER UDDER
O MAN TAKE HEED
NOW ONLY DOST THOU GO THE WAY TO THY GREATNESS
HAIL TO THEE MY WILL
TO BE WICKED--THAT WOULD BE THEIR TRUE GOODNESS
AH DISGUST
CONDEMNED OF THYSELF AND TO THINE OWN STONING
YE HAVE NOT FLOWN HIGH ENOUGH
SO MUCH EVIL ANNOUNCEMENT AND ASHY-GREY LIGHTNINGS PASSED OVER THAT COUNTENANCE
HIS DISCIPLES HOWEVER SAT AROUND HIM IN LONG NIGHT-WATCHES AND WAITED ANXIOUSLY TO SEE IF HE WOULD AWAKE AND SPEAK AGAIN AND RECOVER FROM HIS AFFLICTION
TELL ME YE BRETHREN WHO WILL MASTER IT FOR ME
BUT THE SUPERFICIAL OBSERVER AND A LARGE PORTION OF THE PUBLIC NOT KNOWING OF THESE THINGS,--NOT KNOWING PERHAPS THAT THERE ARE ICONOCLASTS WHO DESTROY OUT OF LOVE AND ARE THEREFORE CREATORS AND THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO DESTROY OUT OF RESENTMENT AND REVENGEFULNESS AND WHO ARE THEREFORE REVOLUTIONISTS AND ANARCHISTS,--ARE PRONE TO CONFOUND THE TWO TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE NOBLER TYPE
THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE
THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE
THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE
IT EXTENDETH AND EXTENDETH
HAVE YE NOW LEARNED MY SONG
WHERE IS THE LIGHTNING TO LICK YOU WITH ITS TONGUE
IS IT NOT THY PIETY ITSELF WHICH NO LONGER LETTETH THEE BELIEVE IN A GOD
IT IS DIFFICULT TO LIVE AMONGST MEN BECAUSE SILENCE IS SO DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY FOR A BABBLER THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
WHAT CARE THEY IF THEY BIND OTHERS STILL FASTER WITH THEIR CHAINS AND GIFTS AND YE ALSO TO WHOM LIFE IS ROUGH LABOUR AND DISQUIET ARE YE NOT VERY TIRED OF LIFE
IF THY WISDOM SHOULD ONE DAY RUN AWAY FROM THEE AH
THAT TO THE STRONGER THE WEAKER SHALL SERVE--THERETO PERSUADETH HE HIS WILL WHO WOULD BE MASTER OVER A STILL WEAKER ONE
ON AN AFTERNOON DID I FIND MY FRIENDS FOR THE FIRST TIME
THOU LONESOME ONE THOU GOEST THE WAY OF THE LOVING ONE
THUS DO THEY ANTICIPATE EVERY ONE'S WISHES AND DO WELL UNTO EVERY ONE
I SHALL SEEK HIM AT ONCE IN THOSE FORESTS
AND VERILY I CAME NOT TO WARN AGAINST PICKPOCKETS EITHER
WHAT WAS IT DROVE ME TO THE POOREST O ZARATHUSTRA

TO ME THE CONVALESCENT WOULD IT NOW BE SUFFERING AND TORMENT TO BELIEVE IN SUCH PHANTOMS
BEHIND THY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS MY BROTHER THERE IS A MIGHTY LORD AN UNKNOWN SAGE--IT IS CALLED SELF

TAKE HEED

HE CALLS THE ONE THE LITTLE SAGACITY AND THE LATTER THE BIG SAGACITY SCHOPENHAUER'S TEACHING CONCERNING THE INTELLECT IS FULLY ENDORSED HERE
FLEE INTO THY SOLITUDE
FOR THE SAKE OF THE LEECH DID I LIE HERE BY THIS SWAMP LIKE A FISHER AND ALREADY HAD MINE OUTSTRETCHED ARM BEEN BITTEN TEN TIMES WHEN THERE BITETH A STILL FINER LEECH AT MY BLOOD ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF
INTO THE BASIS OF THINGS HAVE REWARD AND PUNISHMENT BEEN INSINUATED--AND NOW EVEN INTO THE BASIS OF YOUR SOULS YE VIRTUOUS ONES
LET HIM LIE UNTIL OF HIS OWN ACCORD HE AWAKENETH,--UNTIL OF HIS OWN ACCORD HE REPUDIATETH ALL WEARINESS AND WHAT WEARINESS HATH TAUGHT THROUGH HIM

IN A CHAMBER HIGH ABOVE THE PIAZZA JUST MENTIONED FROM WHICH ONE OBTAINED A GENERAL VIEW OF ROME AND COULD HEAR THE FOUNTAINS PLASHING FAR BELOW THE LONELIEST OF ALL SONGS WAS COMPOSED--'THE NIGHT-SONG ABOUT THIS TIME I WAS OBSESSED BY AN UNSPEAKABLY SAD MELODY THE REFRAIN OF WHICH I RECOGNISED IN THE WORDS DEAD THROUGH IMMORTALITY WE REMAINED SOMEWHAT TOO LONG IN ROME THAT SPRING AND WHAT WITH THE EFFECT OF THE INCREASING HEAT AND THE DISCOURAGING CIRCUMSTANCES ALREADY DESCRIBED MY BROTHER RESOLVED NOT TO WRITE ANY MORE OR IN ANY CASE NOT TO PROCEED WITH ZARATHUSTRA ALTHOUGH I OFFERED TO RELIEVE HIM OF ALL TROUBLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROOFS AND THE PUBLISHER
SUDDENLY HE SPRANG UP FELLOW-SUFFERING
AND WHAT MATTER IF BEETLES AND MAY-BUGS ALSO ALIGHT ON MY LOAD
THEY ALSO GO AGAINST MY TASTE
THOU ART NOT GREAT
BUT THE WORLD ITSELF IS NOT THEREFORE A FILTHY MONSTER
THEY HANG A SWORD AND A HUNDRED CRAVINGS OVER THEM
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS HOWEVER HE REGAINED HIS COMPOSURE AND HIS HEART LAUGHED AT THE FOLLY HE HAD JUST COMMITTED
THERE IS AN ECSTASY SUCH THAT THE IMMENSE STRAIN OF IT IS SOMETIMES RELAXED BY A FLOOD OF TEARS ALONG WITH WHICH ONE'S STEPS EITHER RUSH OR INVOLUNTARILY LAG ALTERNATELY
THIS REQUIRES SCARCELY ANY COMMENT
HE WHO LOOKETH ON BECOMETH WROTH
HERE IS SMOOTH ICE
AND NOW IS YOUR SPIRIT ASHAMED TO BE AT THE SERVICE OF YOUR BOWELS AND GOETH BY-WAYS AND LYING WAYS TO ESCAPE ITS OWN SHAME
I PASS THROUGH THIS PEOPLE AND KEEP MINE EYES OPEN
I PASS THROUGH THIS PEOPLE AND KEEP MINE EYES OPEN
I MYSELF HAVE PUT ON THIS CROWN I MYSELF HAVE CONSECRATED MY LAUGHTER
THE FLEETEST BEAST TO BEAR YOU TO PERFECTION IS SUFFERING MY BROTHER WRITES AS FOLLOWS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRST PART OF ZARATHUSTRA":--"IN THE WINTER OF 1882-83 I WAS LIVING ON THE CHARMING LITTLE GULF OF RAPALLO NOT FAR FROM GENOA AND BETWEEN CHIAVARI AND CAPE PORTO FINO
HE HAD PERHAPS GONE TO SLEEP
HE KNEW TOO WELL WHAT THESE THINGS MEANT TO THE MILLIONS WHO PROFESS THEM TO APPROACH THE TASK OF UPROOTING THEM WITH LEVITY OR EVEN WITH HASTE
INTO THINE EYES GAZED I LATELY O LIFE
THEY WOULD HAVE BECOME PESSIMISTS SUICIDES OR MERCHANTS
IF NOT I WILL DESCRIBE IT
IT LIETH STILL MY STRANGE SOUL
BE A MAN SULEIKA
THEREFORE FOR THE REALLY GREAT UGLY MAN HE MUST NOT EXIST
BUT SO WILLETH IT MY CREATING WILL MY FATE
IN THE YELLOW SANDS AND BURNT BY THE SUN HE DOUBTLESS PEERETH THIRSTILY AT THE ISLES RICH IN FOUNTAINS WHERE LIFE REPOSETH UNDER SHADY TREES
FOR THE GOOD HUNTER SHALL HAVE A GOOD HUNT
THIS HOWEVER MUST NOT BE TAKEN TOO LITERALLY
STILL AM I THE RICHEST AND MOST TO BE ENVIED--I THE LONESOMEST ONE
IT IS IN HONOUR OF THY FRIEND THAT THOU SHOWEST THYSELF TO HIM AS THOU ART
EAT AND FARE YE WELL THEREAFTER ZARATHUSTRA AGAIN WENT ON FOR TWO HOURS TRUSTING TO THE PATH AND THE LIGHT OF THE STARS
CLEARLY HOWEVER SHALL THINE EYE ANSWER ME
SO MUST THOU GO AGAIN INTO SOLITUDE
OH THAT FROST AND WINTER WOULD AGAIN MAKE ME CRACK AND CRUNCH SIGHED I:--THEN AROSE ICY MIST OUT OF ME
THAT HOWEVER IS AT PRESENT CALLED DISGUST
THE QUESTION OF TASTE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY AND VERSES 9 10 OF THIS DISCOURSE EXACTLY STATE NIETZSCHE'S ULTIMATE VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT
O MY BRETHREN I HEARD A LAUGHTER WHICH WAS NO HUMAN LAUGHTER,--AND NOW GNAWETH A THIRST AT ME A LONGING THAT IS NEVER ALLAYED
FOR OTHERS DO I WAIT HERE IN THESE MOUNTAINS AND WILL NOT LIFT MY FOOT FROM THENCE WITHOUT THEM
HE WHO ONE DAY TEACHETH MEN TO FLY WILL HAVE SHIFTED ALL LANDMARKS
WILL--SO IS THE EMANCIPATOR AND JOY-BRINGER CALLED
THIS DISCOURSE OFFERS US AN ANALYSIS OF THEIR MENTAL ATTITUDE
WITH THE NAMES OF ITS HAPPINESS DOTH IT BANISH FROM ITSELF EVERYTHING CONTEMPTIBLE
THE LION HATH COME MY CHILDREN ARE NIGH ZARATHUSTRA HATH GROWN RIPE MINE HOUR HATH COME THIS IS MY MORNING MY DAY BEGINNETH
THEN BROKE THE WINGS OF THEIR SPIRIT
THE LION HATH COME MY CHILDREN ARE NIGH
WOUNDED AM I BY MY HAPPINESS
CAST BUT YOUR PURE EYES INTO THE WELL OF MY DELIGHT MY FRIENDS
THUS WILL I DIE MYSELF THAT YE FRIENDS MAY LOVE THE EARTH MORE FOR MY SAKE
ALAS HE TOOTED AS A MOURNFUL HORN TO MINE EAR
VIRTUE FOR THEM IS WHAT MAKETH MODEST AND TAME
CAST NOT THY LOVE AND HOPE AWAY
WHAT DO THEY WANT IN MY DOMAIN
AT ALL EVENTS ONE WAY OR OTHER--HE IS GONE
THAT ONE MAY ENDURE TO BE WITH ONESELF AND NOT GO ROVING ABOUT
ONWARD THE RIVER NOW CARRIETH YOUR BOAT
IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL HE WRITES
THE GOOD MUST CRUCIFY HIM WHO DEVISETH HIS OWN VIRTUE
THIS IS A RECORD OF NIETZSCHE'S FINAL BREACH WITH HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES--THE SCHOLARS OF GERMANY
LIKE A BITTERLY ANGRY CROAKING RAN THE SOUND THROUGH THE LONG CORRIDORS WHEN THE LEAVES OF THE GATE OPENED
FAIN LIKEWISE WOULD IT PLAY WITH THE FIRE--OF THE FAGOT AND STAKE
IT IS RATHER THE DESPERATION OF THE NETTED LION THAT ULTIMATELY STOPS ALL MOVEMENT BECAUSE THE MORE IT MOVES THE MORE INVOLVED IT BECOMES
VIOLENTLY THEY HATE THE DISCERNING ONES AND THE LATEST OF VIRTUES WHICH IS UPRIGHTNESS
BUT HE TAKETH REVENGE FOR IT--ON HIS FRIENDS THUS SPAKE THE OLD MAGICIAN AND THE HIGHER MEN APPLAUDED HIM
VENGEANCE WILL WE USE AND INSULT AGAINST ALL WHO ARE NOT LIKE US"--THUS DO THE TARANTULA-HEARTS PLEDGE THEMSELVES
NOT STILL STIFF SMOOTH AND COLD BECOME AN IMAGE A GODLIKE STATUE SET UP IN FRONT OF TEMPLES AS A GOD'S OWN DOOR-GUARD
YE SHALL NOT WILL THAT HOWEVER IS A SERMON FOR SLAVERY
WE DO NOT QUESTION EACH OTHER WE DO NOT COMPLAIN TO EACH OTHER
AND THIS HEARD I SECONDLY
WHAT FOLLOWS IS CLEAR ENOUGH
WHAT FOLLOWS IS CLEAR ENOUGH
YEA A HELLISH ARTIFICE HATH HERE BEEN DEVISED A DEATH-HORSE JINGLING WITH THE TRAPPINGS OF DIVINE HONOURS
NOT ONLY DOTH HE LIE WHO SPEAKETH CONTRARY TO HIS KNOWLEDGE BUT MORE SO HE WHO SPEAKETH CONTRARY TO HIS IGNORANCE
BUT HE WHO WOULD BECOME LIGHT AND BE A BIRD MUST LOVE HIMSELF:--THUS DO I TEACH
THE SOOTHSAYER HOWEVER SHALL EAT AND DRINK AT MY SIDE
IT DESPISETH ALSO ALL BITTER-SWEET WISDOM
WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT IS GOOD AND JUST WE POSSESS IT ALSO
WHAT TO SACRIFICE
FOR SUCH SEVERITY NEITHER THY MOUTH NOR THINE EYE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THEE
VERILY BADLY SMELL ALL YESTERDAYS AND TO-DAYS OF THE SCRIBBLING RABBLE
SELF-SURPASSING
SELF-SURPASSING
SELF-SURPASSING
AND WHEN I LIVED WITH THEM THEN DID I LIVE ABOVE THEM
NIETZSCHE DETESTED THE OBTRUSIVE AND GUSHING PITY THAT GOES UP TO MISERY WITHOUT A BLUSH EITHER ON ITS CHEEK OR IN ITS HEART--THE PITY WHICH IS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF SELF-GLORIFICATION
THE UGLIEST MAN BEGAN ONCE MORE AND FOR THE LAST TIME TO GURGLE AND SNORT AND WHEN HE HAD AT LENGTH FOUND EXPRESSION BEHOLD
FAR TOO VIOLENTLY DOTH MY HEART STILL FLOW TOWARDS THEE MY HEART ON WHICH MY SUMMER BURNETH MY SHORT HOT MELANCHOLY OVER-HAPPY SUMMER
LEST IT BECOME THE ROAD TO HELL--TO FILTH AND LUST OF SOUL
THE SELF SEEKETH WITH THE EYES OF THE SENSES IT HEARKENETH ALSO WITH THE EARS OF THE SPIRIT
YE HIGHER MEN THE WORST THING IN YOU IS THAT YE HAVE NONE OF YOU LEARNED TO DANCE AS YE OUGHT TO DANCE--TO DANCE BEYOND YOURSELVES
FOR THE HIGH LONGETH EVERY STARLESS BOSOM
WHAT DOTH IT MATTER THAT YE HAVE FAILED
OLD HEART
NOW NOTHING MATTERETH TO ME ANY MORE
AND HE WHO SEEKETH TO CREATE BEYOND HIMSELF HATH FOR ME THE PUREST WILL
READY FOR MY SEVEREST PAIN DO I HERE STAND:--AT THE WRONG TIME HAST THOU COME
FOR THAT PURPOSE MAY THE GARDEN OF MARRIAGE HELP THEE
WHAT MEAN'TH THIS TORTURE WITH DULL INDENTED ARROWS
AND THEN THEY DISPARAGED ALL HIGH HOPES
GREAT EVENTS
GREAT EVENTS
GREAT EVENTS
BUT DOGGISH LUST LOOKETH ENVIOUSLY OUT OF ALL THAT THEY DO
5

HE THEREFORE CREATED A PERFECT FRIEND FOR HIMSELF IN THE IDEAL FORM OF A MAJESTIC PHILOSOPHER AND MADE THIS CREATION THE PREACHER OF HIS GOSPEL TO THE WORLD
MAN CAN ALSO BE OVERLEAPT SURPASS THYSELF EVEN IN THY NEIGHBOUR
VERILY IT ANNOYETH ONE TO GIVE UNTO THEM AND IT ANNOYETH ONE NOT TO GIVE UNTO THEM
EVEN THIS MAN HATH LOVED HIMSELF AS HE HATH DESPISED HIMSELF,--A GREAT LOVER METHINKETH HE IS AND A GREAT DESPISER
AND CURSED AS THE WORLD BY ALL BACKWORLDSMEN
NOT TO BE SURE WITH THE LOVE OF THE SICK AND INFECTED FOR WITH THEM STINKETH EVEN SELF-LOVE
ON THE CONTRARY HE LAY QUIETLY WITH CLOSED EYES LIKE A PERSON SLEEPING ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SLEEP
THE WORLD ITSELF HATH BECOME RIPE THE GRAPE TURNETH BROWN NOW DOTH IT WISH TO DIE TO DIE OF HAPPINESS
WHO THEN IS YOUR NEIGHBOUR
WHAT DO YE KNOW OF VIRTUE
AMONG FORESTS AND SWAMPS MY HUNGER ATTACKETH ME AND LATE IN THE NIGHT
SPEAK
SPEAK
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER WENT ON THROUGH THE DARK STREETS
THEN SAID HE
WHAT SHOULD YE HAVE IN COMMON WITH CATS AND WOLVES
SHOW ME THAT THOU ART NOT A LUSTING AND AMBITIOUS ONE
THAT IS TO BE READY ALSO FOR DEATH
AND NOTHING EVIL GROWETH IN THEE ANY LONGER UNLESS IT BE THE EVIL THAT GROWETH OUT OF THE CONFLICT OF THY VIRTUES
THIS CROWN OF THE LAUGHTER THIS ROSE-GARLAND CROWN
THIS CROWN OF THE LAUGHTER THIS ROSE-GARLAND CROWN
BUT I NEED LIVING COMPANIONS WHO WILL FOLLOW ME BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FOLLOW THEMSELVES--AND TO THE PLACE WHERE I WILL
BUT IT WAS A LIAR WITH ITS PREGNANCY
VAPOUR WOULD IT BECOME AND HEIGHT AND PATH OF LIGHT AND LIGHT ITSELF
BUT THEIR TIME IS PAST
AND THUS DO I BID YOU DO MY FRIENDS
OR IS IT THIS
OR IS IT THIS
OR IS IT THIS
OR IS IT THIS
OR IS IT THIS
THEN DID HE INTERRUPT ME SULLENLY AND ASKED
IF I BE FOND OF THE SEA AND ALL THAT IS SEALIKE AND FONDEST OF IT WHEN IT ANGRILY CONTRADICTETH ME
VERILY THEIR SAVIOURS THEMSELVES CAME NOT FROM FREEDOM AND FREEDOM'S SEVENTH HEAVEN
AND VERILY I DID NOT NOURISH THEM WITH FLATULENT VEGETABLES
THAT DO I TAKE AS THE BEST SIGN
NAY
NAY
NAY
NAY
NAY
NAY
NAY
NAY
NAY
NAY
NAY
NAY
WHICH LAUGH YEA
WHEN THE WATER HATH PLANKS WHEN GANGWAYS AND RAILINGS O'ERSPAN THE STREAM VERILY HE IS NOT BELIEVED WHO THEN SAITH
THEREFORE AM I FORBEARING TO THE VAIN BECAUSE THEY ARE THE PHYSICIANS OF MY MELANCHOLY AND KEEP ME ATTACHED TO MAN AS TO A DRAMA
AND SO EAGERLY DID I FIND THEM PLAYING THAT THEY PERSPIRED THEREBY
WHAT HAVE YE DONE TO SURPASS MAN
SO SAID I TO MYSELF
A COIL OF WILD SERPENTS THAT ARE SELDOM AT PEACE AMONG THEMSELVES--SO THEY GO FORTH APART AND SEEK PREY IN THE WORLD
HARDLY ARE THEY BORN WHEN THEY BEGIN TO DIE AND LONG FOR DOCTRINES OF LASSITUDE AND RENUNCIATION
UNTRUSTWORTHY ONES
THE THREE METAMORPHOSES
THE THREE METAMORPHOSES
THE THREE METAMORPHOSES
BUT ONE DAY SHALL I YET FIND THE STRENGTH AND THE LION'S VOICE WHICH WILL CALL THEE UP
YE YOURSELVES ARE NOT THOSE UNTO WHOM MY HERITAGE AND NAME BELONG
FORGIVE IT O ZARATHUSTRA TO AN OLD PIOUS PONTIFF-HEART AND THOU SAID ZARATHUSTRA TO THE WANDERER AND SHADOW THOU CALLEST AND THINKEST THYSELF A FREE SPIRIT
IT REPRESENTS BUT AN ATTEMPT ON MY PART--A VERY FEEBLE ONE PERHAPS--TO GIVE THE READER WHAT LITTLE HELP I CAN IN SURMOUNTING DIFFICULTIES WHICH A LONG STUDY OF NIETZSCHE'S LIFE AND WORKS HAS ENABLED ME PARTIALLY I HOPE TO OVERCOME
ALL LIVING THINGS ARE OBEYING THINGS
THEY WONDER WHY I AM NOT READY TO ABET AND WHET THEIR WISDOM
ANOTHER IDEAL RUNS ON BEFORE US A STRANGE TEMPTING IDEAL FULL OF DANGER TO WHICH WE SHOULD NOT LIKE TO PERSUADE ANY ONE BECAUSE WE DO NOT SO READILY ACKNOWLEDGE ANY ONE'S RIGHT THERETO
SO WILLETH YOUR WILL
THE GOOD AND JUST HATE THEE AND CALL THEE THEIR ENEMY AND DESPISER
SO CALL I THE WILL OF THE TWAIN TO CREATE THE ONE THAT IS MORE THAN THOSE WHO CREATED IT
XXXII
XXXII
I AM COURTEOUS TOWARDS THEM AS TOWARDS ALL SMALL ANNOYANCES
JOY TO ME
JOY TO ME
AND WHATEVER IT SAITH IT LIETH
AND A RIGHT WHICH THOU CANST SEIZE UPON SHALT THOU NOT ALLOW TO BE GIVEN THEE
PEOPLES ONCE HUNG OVER THEM TABLES OF THE GOOD
INTO THE COLDEST WATER DID I PLUNGE WITH HEAD AND HEART
A SEA FULL OF MANY-HUED FISHES AND CRABS FOR WHICH EVEN THE GODS MIGHT LONG AND MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO BECOME FISHERS IN IT AND CASTERS OF NETS,--SO RICH IS THE WORLD IN WONDERFUL THINGS GREAT AND SMALL
YE HIGHEST MEN WHO HAVE COME WITHIN MY KEN
A PATH WHICH ASCENDED DARINGLY AMONG BOULDERS AN EVIL LONESOME PATH WHICH NEITHER HERB NOR SHRUB ANY LONGER CHEERED A MOUNTAIN-PATH CRUNCHED UNDER THE DARING OF MY FOOT
AND ONE SHOULD NOT WISH TO ENJOY
NO BITTERNESS OR EMPTY HATE DICTATED HIS VITUPERATIONS AGAINST EXISTING VALUES AND AGAINST THE DOGMAS OF HIS PARENTS AND FOREFATHERS
NOW RUNNETH SHE FOOLISHLY IN THE ARID WILDERNESS AND SEEKETH AND SEEKETH THE SOFT SWARD--MINE OLD WILD WISDOM
THEN STOODST THOU THERE HALF-TURNED AND IN THINE EYE CARESSES
IT IS THE HIGHEST TIME FOR WHAT IS IT THEN--THE HIGHEST TIME THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
THERE ARE ALSO HEAVY ANIMALS IN A STATE OF HAPPINESS THERE ARE CLUB-FOOTED ONES FROM THE BEGINNING
FOR JOYS ALL WANT--ETERNITY
FOR WHY THE LADDER
THE POEM IN THIS DISCOURSE IS OF COURSE REMINISCENT OF WAGNER'S OWN POETICAL MANNER AND IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE WHOLE WAS WRITTEN SUBSEQUENT TO NIETZSCHE'S FINAL BREAK WITH HIS FRIEND
THEREIN DO I ADMIRE THEE AND THY GOOD TASTE
YEA THOU ART STILL FOR ME THE DEMOLISHER OF ALL GRAVES
OFTEN LIETH THE SPIRIT CONCERNING THE SOUL
O ZARATHUSTRA EVERYTHING DO I KNOW
TOO MANY GOOD THINGS HATH IT ALREADY TASTED
THIS IS THE MAN WITHOUT DISGUST THIS IS ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF THE SURMOUNTER OF THE GREAT DISGUST THIS IS THE EYE THIS IS THE MOUTH THIS IS THE HEART OF ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF AND WHILST HE THUS SPAKE HE KISSED WITH O'ERFLOWING EYES THE HANDS OF HIM WITH WHOM HE SPAKE AND BEHAVED ALTOGETHER LIKE ONE TO WHOM A PRECIOUS GIFT AND JEWEL HATH FALLEN UNAWARES FROM HEAVEN
WILT THOU NOW CARRY THY FIRE INTO THE VALLEYS
AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY PEER MODESTLY AFTER A NEW SMALL HAPPINESS
THEN DID YE CHANGE MY NIGH ONES AND NEAREST ONES INTO ULCERATIONS
THE SAINT ANSWERED
PRESERVE AND SPARE ME FOR ONE GREAT FATE
AND WHEN ONE GIVETH THE BLIND MAN EYES THEN DOTH HE SEE TOO MANY BAD THINGS ON THE EARTH
THE NIGHT HOWEVER WAS COLD AT THIS HEIGHT AND CLEAR AND STARRY
THERE COMETH THE TIME WHEN MAN WILL NO LONGER LAUNCH THE ARROW OF HIS LONGING BEYOND MAN--AND THE STRING OF HIS BOW WILL HAVE UNLEARNED TO WHIZZ
THE MORALITY OF THE POWERFUL CLASS NIETZSCHE CALLS NOBLE OR MASTER-MORALITY
THOU HAST DISCOVERED OUR DISTRESS
REVENGE IS IN THY SOUL
IT SUCCEEDETH WITH FOOLS
AND LONG DID HE BALANCE THE STAFF DOUBTFULLY IN HIS HAND
THAT TESTIMONY IS INSCRIBED ON THEIR STONES AND ON THE WALLS OF THEIR SUMMITS
THAT HOWEVER--NAMELY PITY--IS CALLED VIRTUE ITSELF AT PRESENT BY ALL PETTY PEOPLE:--THEY HAVE NO REVERENCE FOR GREAT MISFORTUNE GREAT UGLINESS GREAT FAILURE
AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER THERE SOUNDED BEFORE HIM A ROAR,--A LONG SOFT LION-ROAR
ADEQUATE WAS HE FOR HIS DEED WHEN HE DID IT BUT THE IDEA OF IT HE COULD NOT ENDURE WHEN IT WAS DONE
HE WHO KNOWETH THE READER DOETH NOTHING MORE FOR THE READER
WHAT HAVE THEY KNOWN HITHERTO OF THE FERVOUR OF TONES THEY ARE ALSO NOT PURE ENOUGH FOR ME
THE NAME OF THE GATEWAY IS INSCRIBED ABOVE
I AM A WANDERER AND MOUNTAIN-CLIMBER SAID HE TO HIS HEART I LOVE NOT THE PLAINS AND IT SEEMETH I CANNOT LONG SIT STILL
THE HALF-AND-HALF SPOIL EVERY WHOLE
HEAREST THOU O ZARATHUSTRA CALLED OUT THE SOOTHSAYER THE CRY CONCERNETH THEE IT CALLETH THEE
THERE WAS HOWEVER A GATEWAY JUST WHERE WE HALTED
AS IT HAPPENETH WITH ME SO IS IT WITH ALL FRUITS THAT TURN RIPE
HE MEANT TO ROB I TELL YOU HOWEVER THAT HIS SOUL WANTED BLOOD NOT BOOTY
BUT THE DEVIL IS NEVER AT THE PLACE WHICH WOULD BE HIS RIGHT PLACE
TOWARDS THE THRONE THEY ALL STRIVE
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA ONCE TOLD THIS TO HIS DISCIPLES THEY ASKED HIM
YE CREATING ONES YE HIGHER MEN
YE CREATING ONES YE HIGHER MEN
THEY SHALL HELP THEE TO SEEK
BECOME WHAT THOU ART THUS MAY MEN NOW COME UP TO ME
AND IN WINTER SHE IS MOST FAITHFUL UNTO ME
THE FLASHING INTERROGATIVE-SIGN BESIDE PREMATURE ANSWERS
BUT I SAY UNTO YOU YE COMFORTABLE ONES THAT IT TAKETH TO ITSELF AND WILL EVER TAKE MORE AND MORE FROM YOU
AT LAST HOWEVER DID I SAY WHAT I HAD SAID AT FIRST
LEAVE ME ALONE THOU DULL DOLTISH STUPID DAY
TEST IT SERIOUSLY WHETHER I HAVE CREPT INTO THE HEART OF LIFE ITSELF AND INTO THE ROOTS OF ITS HEART
SLOWLY BUT SURELY HE THOUGHT THE VALUES OF CHRISTIANITY AND JUDAIC TRADITIONS HAD DONE THEIR WORK IN THE MINDS OF MEN
AND NO SOONER HAD HE LAID HIMSELF ON THE GROUND IN THE STILLNESS AND SECRECY OF THE VARIEGATED GRASS THAN HE HAD FORGOTTEN HIS LITTLE THIRST AND FELL ASLEEP
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER BECAME PROFOUNDLY ABSORBED IN THOUGHT SO THAT HE SHUT HIS EYES
SUFFER THE CHANCE TO COME UNTO ME
THIS SIGN I GIVE UNTO YOU AS THE SIGN OF THE STATE
ON IT DO I COLLAPSE
FOR AS YET HE KNEW NOT THE INTERPRETATION THEREOF
FROM WEARINESS YAWNETH HE AT THE PATH AT THE EARTH AT THE GOAL AND AT HIMSELF
THEY INFLATE AND MAKE EMPTIER THAN EVER
AH THOU AMIABLE FOOL ZARATHUSTRA THOU TOO-BLINDLY CONFIDING ONE
AND WHEN ONCE THEIR HATRED AND JEALOUSY RELAX THE LIMBS THEIR JUSTICE BECOMETH LIVELY AND RUBBETH ITS SLEEPY EYES
SEE TO IT SEE TO IT THAT THY PRIDE DOTH NOT HERE BREAK ITS LEGS
RECOGNISED AND TESTED SHALL EACH BE TO SEE IF HE BE OF MY TYPE AND LINEAGE:--IF HE BE MASTER OF A LONG WILL SILENT EVEN WHEN HE SPEAKETH AND GIVING IN SUCH WISE THAT HE TAKETH IN GIVING SO THAT HE MAY ONE DAY BECOME MY COMPANION A FELLOW-CREATOR AND FELLOW-ENJOYER WITH ZARATHUSTRA:--SUCH A ONE AS WRITETH MY WILL ON MY TABLES FOR THE FULLER PERFECTION OF ALL THINGS
FOR THOU SHALT BE UNTO HIM AN ARROW AND A LONGING FOR THE SUPERMAN
A GREAT MAN BUT WHAT GOOD DO ALL BELLOWS DO
I AM NOT THEIR PHYSICIAN AND TEACHER
THEY KNOW NOW HOW TO BLOW HORNS AND GO ABOUT AT NIGHT AND AWAKEN OLD THINGS WHICH HAVE LONG FALLEN ASLEEP
AND IT IS ABOUT TO END
VOLUPTUOUSNESS
VOLUPTUOUSNESS
VOLUPTUOUSNESS
VOLUPTUOUSNESS
VOLUPTUOUSNESS
THE MOON IS COOL THE WIND IS STILL
THOU SHALT SLAY THYSELF
HIS STEP BETRAYETH WHETHER A PERSON ALREADY WALKETH ON HIS OWN PATH
LO--HUSH
THEN IT BECAME YET STILLER AND MORE MYSTERIOUS AND EVERYTHING HEARKENED EVEN THE ASS AND ZARATHUSTRA'S NOBLE ANIMALS THE EAGLE AND THE SERPENT,--LIKEWISE THE CAVE OF ZARATHUSTRA AND THE BIG COOL MOON AND THE NIGHT ITSELF
FOR WILLING IS CREATING
WHAT SEEKST THOU BY THY TORTURING
EVERYTHING WILL IT GIVE YOU IF YE WORSHIP IT THE NEW IDOL
HERE ZARATHUSTRA GIVES NAMES TO THE INTELLECT AND THE INSTINCTS
ARE THEY NOT BOTH--LONESOME ONES WHOEVER THOU ART SAID THE TRODDEN ONE STILL ENRAGED THOU TREADEST ALSO TOO NIGH ME WITH THY PARABLE AND NOT ONLY WITH THY FOOT
IF MAN HOWEVER HATH BEEN A FAILURE
I HAVE DEPARTED FROM THE HOUSE OF THE SCHOLARS AND THE DOOR HAVE I ALSO SLAMMED BEHIND ME
AH EVEN UPON THEIR HYPOCRISY DID MINE EYES CURIOSITY ALIGHT
AND LET YOUR HIGHEST HOPE BE THE HIGHEST THOUGHT OF LIFE
AND OFTEN WITH OUR LOVE WE WANT MERELY TO OVERLEAP ENVY
THAT TOOK PLACE WHEN THE UNGODLIEST UTTERANCE CAME FROM A GOD HIMSELF--THE UTTERANCE
THY WILD DOGS WANT LIBERTY
AND IF IT WANTED TO SPEAK IT WOULD HAVE NONE WHO COULD UNDERSTAND IT
WHEN THOU REACHEST THY GOAL WHEN THOU ALIGHTEST FROM THY HORSE
NOT LONG WILL IT BE ERE THEY DEVISE FESTIVALS AND PUT UP MEMORIALS TO THEIR OLD JOYS
BY SO HUMILIATING THYSELF THOU HAST SAVED THY LIFE TO-DAY
THE STILLEST HOUR
THE STILLEST HOUR
THE STILLEST HOUR
I FEAR THEE NEAR I LOVE THEE FAR
SUCH IS YOUR ULTIMATE HOPE AND ECSTASY
THEREIN VIEWING THEREIN HEWING--THEY ARE THE SAME THING
THAT HOWEVER IS THE LAST MAN AND THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA UNTO THE PEOPLE
ZARATHUSTRA THEREUPON LAID HOLD OF THE TREE BESIDE WHICH THE YOUTH SAT AND SPAKE THUS
NOT THAT I ON THAT ACCOUNT UPBRAID THEM
AND WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES SHALL HE ASK YOU FOR A DANCE
ON EVERY SIMILE DOST THOU HERE RIDE TO EVERY TRUTH
ON EVERY SIMILE DOST THOU HERE RIDE TO EVERY TRUTH
BUT WHO WOULD DIVINE THAT THEIR DUST CAME FROM CORN AND FROM THE YELLOW DELIGHT OF THE SUMMER FIELDS
BLESSED ARE THEY ESPECIALLY IF ONE ALWAYS GIVE IN TO THEM
BUT THEY WANT TO BE RID OF LIFE
THOU THREWEST THYSELF HIGH BUT EVERY THROWN STONE MUST--FALL
ALL ON A SUDDEN HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA'S EAR WAS FRIGHTENED
SHALL I COMMIT ADULTERY
THE STREAK OF CHALK BEWITCHETH THE HEN
HE TELLS THEM OF OTHER CRIPPLES--THE GREAT MEN IN THIS WORLD WHO HAVE ONE ORGAN OR FACULTY INORDINATELY DEVELOPED AT THE COST OF THEIR OTHER FACULTIES
VERILY IT SHALL NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT BECOME HEAVIER TO ME
THEIR FINGERS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CREEP BEHIND FISTS
AND IF THE PUNISHMENT BE NOT ALSO A RIGHT AND AN HONOUR TO THE TRANSGRESSOR I DO NOT LIKE YOUR PUNISHING
AND HE STOOD STILL AND WAS LONG SILENT
THE ASS-FESTIVAL
THE ASS-FESTIVAL
THE ASS-FESTIVAL
THEN DID I GO TO THE GATE
O AFTERNOON
AND THE SHORT MADNESS OF HAPPINESS WHICH ONLY THE GREATEST SUFFERER EXPERIENCETH
MY FINAL BLISS
BREAK UP BREAK UP I PRAY YOU THE GOOD AND JUST!--O MY BRETHREN HAVE YE UNDERSTOOD ALSO THIS WORD
BUT THAT I MAY REVEAL MY HEART ENTIRELY UNTO YOU MY FRIENDS
TO RISE ABOVE IT--TO SOAR--IS THE MOST DIFFICULT OF ALL THINGS TO-DAY
VERILY MEN HAVE GIVEN UNTO THEMSELVES ALL THEIR GOOD AND BAD
APPLYING THIS PRINCIPLE TO MANKIND NIETZSCHE ATTACKED CHRISTIAN MORAL VALUES
HAVE YE ALREADY FLOWN HIGH ENOUGH
BEHOLD THE BELIEVERS OF ALL BELIEFS
LET YOUR WILL SAY
FIT FOR WAR THE ONE
THEY ARE DISTRUSTFUL OF ANCHORITES AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE COME WITH GIFTS
BACKWORLDSMEN
BACKWORLDSMEN
THE APOSTATES
THE APOSTATES
THE APOSTATES
AND FURTHER WHO CONCEIVETH THE FULL DEPTH OF THE MODESTY OF THE VAIN MAN
AND IF YOUR THOUGHTS SUCCUMB YOUR UPRIGHTNESS SHALL STILL SHOUT TRIUMPH THEREBY
BEHOLD ZARATHUSTRA
BEHOLD ZARATHUSTRA
AND IT SQUATTED ON A STONE IN FRONT OF ME
TO LOOK DOWN UPON MYSELF AND EVEN UPON MY STARS
FOR HE SUFFERETH IT NOT IF A GNAT WANTETH TO BUZZ OR EVEN TWO OF THEM
VERILY ENOUGH TO MAKE A GIRL FOR HIMSELF THEREFROM
A LITTLE FATTER A LITTLE LEANER OH HOW MUCH FATE IS IN SO LITTLE
THEREIN SHALL HE RECEIVE NO SCATH
BUT I--I WISH ALSO TO PUSH IT
WHERE MAY IT NOW TARRY ALL-FORSAKEN WEEPING
ONE BEARETH ONLY THE UNFORTUNATE AND THEY ALSO ARE PREACHERS OF DEATH
THOSE WHO ARE MORE INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING ORTHODOXY THAN IN BEING OVER NICE CONCERNING THE KIND OF SUPPORT THEY GIVE IT OFTEN REFER TO THESE PEOPLE AS EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR OF THE TRUE FAITH
HE WHO CLIMBETH ON THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS LAUGHETH AT ALL TRAGIC PLAYS AND TRAGIC REALITIES
I AM ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS
LET IN GOOD AIR
A WHIFF OF WARM BREATH A LITTLE SOFT TUFT ON ITS PAW
AND WHAT O ZARATHUSTRA IS THE MORAL OF THY STORY AND ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED THEM THUS
WITH STOLEN TEETH IT BITETH THE BITING ONE
NOW HOWEVER DOTH IT HOLD FAST HIM WHOM THOU SEEKEST ME ZARATHUSTRA
IN THE PRESENCE OF THE UGLIEST MAN NIETZSCHE BLUSHES,--HE BLUSHES FOR HIS RACE
HE HIMSELF WOULD HAVE DISAVOWED HIS DOCTRINE HAD HE ATTAINED TO MY AGE
THERE IS ANOTHER MADNESS BESIDES AND IT IS BEFORE THE DEED
FULL STOOD THE MUSTY VAULTS OF THOSE TROPHIES OF VICTORY
THEREFORE ALL BELIEF IS OF SO LITTLE ACCOUNT
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER SAT UPRIGHT ON HIS COUCH WITH AN ABSENT LOOK
NO STRANGER TO ME IS THIS WANDERER
ENTIRELY HARD IS ONLY THE NOBLEST
SAID YE EVER
WHERE THESE MEET THERE ARISETH THE BLUSTERER THE SAVIOUR GREATER ONES VERILY HAVE THERE BEEN AND HIGHER-BORN ONES THAN THOSE WHOM THE PEOPLE CALL SAVIOURS THOSE RAPTUROUS BLUSTERERS
DID NOT THAT GOD WANT ALSO TO BE JUDGE
AND MY SOUL ALSO IS THE SONG OF A LOVING ONE THUS SANG ZARATHUSTRA
VERILY I HAVE OFTEN LAUGHED AT THE WEAKLINGS WHO THINK THEMSELVES GOOD BECAUSE THEY HAVE CRIPPLED PAWS
THAT THE LONESOME HEIGHT MAY NOT FOR EVER REMAIN LONESOME AND SELF-SUFFICING
THOU KNOWEST IT ZARATHUSTRA AND I CRIED IN TERROR AT THIS WHISPERING AND THE BLOOD LEFT MY FACE
WHAT I AM NOT THAT THAT IS GOD TO ME AND VIRTUE AND OTHERS ARE THERE WHO GO ALONG HEAVILY AND CREAKINGLY LIKE CARTS TAKING STONES DOWNHILL
FOR YE SUFFER FROM YOURSELVES YE HAVE NOT YET SUFFERED FROM MAN
BUT ON THAT ACCOUNT I AM NOT UNFRIENDLY TO THE HENS
YOUR WILL AND YOUR FEET WHICH SEEK TO SURPASS YOU--LET THESE BE YOUR NEW HONOUR
THE SECOND IS PASSIVE DEFENSIVE,--TO IT BELONGS THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE WHERE ATTEMPTS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE TO RECONCILE THE TWO MORALITIES THEY MAY BE DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS:--ALL IS GOOD IN THE NOBLE MORALITY WHICH PROCEEDS FROM STRENGTH POWER HEALTH WELL-CONSTITUTEDNESS HAPPINESS AND AWFULNESS
FOR HE REMEMBERED HIS SICKNESS
THE LONESOMEST LEG
BUT ZARATHUSTRA MAKES NOT A MOVE TOWARDS THEM
THUS DID MY FOOT FORCE ITS WAY UPWARDS
HERE FLOWETH ALL BLOOD PUTRIDLY AND TEPIDLY AND FROTHILY THROUGH ALL VEINS
THE RING'S THIRST IS IN YOU
RAISE NOT A FINGER AGAINST IT LET WHOEVER WILL CHOKE AND STAB AND SKIN AND SCRAPE THE PEOPLE
ALL MY HOT TEARS IN STREAMLETS TRICKLE THEIR COURSE TO THEE
THUS CALLETH HE HIS EVIL EYE VIRTUE AND SOME WANT TO BE EDIFIED AND RAISED UP AND CALL IT VIRTUE
THUS WILLETH MY FUTURE
WHO AMONG YOU CAN AT THE SAME TIME LAUGH AND BE EXALTED
WHO AMONG YOU CAN AT THE SAME TIME LAUGH AND BE EXALTED
THERE STOOD THE SUN STILL EXACTLY ABOVE HIS HEAD
THE WINTER WAS COLD AND EXCEPTIONALLY RAINY
FOR HE COMMUNED JUST THEN WITH HIS SOUL
NOW HOWEVER ARE WE FIRSTLINGS
BUT NOT MUCH LONGER DO I THEN STAND
REDEMPTION
REDEMPTION
REDEMPTION
SO THERE IS NO END TO THEIR RAILLERY
SO WILLETH MINE ETERNAL FATE--AS ANNOUNCER DO I SUCCUMB
I COME AGAIN ETERNALLY TO THIS IDENTICAL AND SELFSAME LIFE IN ITS GREATEST AND ITS SMALLEST TO TEACH AGAIN THE ETERNAL RETURN OF ALL THINGS TO SPEAK AGAIN THE WORD OF THE GREAT NOONTIDE OF EARTH AND MAN TO ANNOUNCE AGAIN TO MAN THE SUPERMAN
ART THOU A NEW STRENGTH AND A NEW AUTHORITY
THUS DID I SIT AMONG THEM AND STILL SAID TO MYSELF
FOR THUS THESE SAME VALUES STAND OVER THE STREAM OF LIFE AND LIFE FLOWS ON BENEATH THEM AND LEAVES THEM STANDING
PRESERVE ME FROM ALL SMALL VICTORIES
NOW WILL IT MAKE MY SOUL ALSO DIZZY WITH REVENGE
AND THOU HERE PRACTISEST SUCH IDOLATRY AND HIEROLATRY
BUT A HOME HAVE I FOUND NOWHERE
I LOVE HONEY I ALSO GRIND CORN
THEY HAVE ALL OF THEM BECOME PIOUS AGAIN THEY PRAY THEY ARE MAD!"--SAID HE AND WAS ASTONISHED BEYOND MEASURE
VII
VII
ON THE OTHER HAND HE BELIEVED THAT THE SECOND OR SLAVE-MORALITY WHERE IT BECAME PARAMOUNT LED TO DEGENERATION BECAUSE IT WAS PASSIVE AND DEFENSIVE WANTING MERELY TO KEEP THOSE WHO PRACTISED IT ALIVE
INTRODUCTION BY MRS FORSTER-NIETZSCHE
INTRODUCTION BY MRS FORSTER-NIETZSCHE
ALREADY AM I LESS ALONE
MY VIRTUE BECAME WEARY OF ITSELF BY ITS ABUNDANCE
AND I FEEL ALSO THAT IT DREAMETH
DAS LEBEN FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE'S PUBLISHED BY NAUMANN
AS IF HE HAD EVER PROVED ANYTHING
MANY SEEK TO RAISE THEMSELVES AGAIN BY YOU
HIS SOUL HOWEVER BECAME IMPATIENT AND FULL OF LONGING FOR THOSE WHOM HE LOVED
CHAPTER XXIX
THY PROUDEST OF CAPTIVES THOU ROBBER HIND THE CLOUD-BANKS
FOR HE SAW ANOTHER SHADOW BESIDE HIS OWN
AT THE ICE OF KNOWLEDGE WILL HE YET FREEZE TO DEATH!"--SO THEY MOURN
BUT THE WIND WHICH WE SEE NOT TROUBLETH AND BENDETH IT AS IT LISTETH
BUT DAY COMETH
WHEN ONE TAKETH HIS HUMP FROM THE HUNCHBACK THEN DOTH ONE TAKE FROM HIM HIS SPIRIT--SO DO THE PEOPLE TEACH
FOR THIS IS THE SECRET OF THE SOUL
WHENCE COMETH THAT WHICH THOU SNORTEST UP
THEIR SPIRIT WAS IMPRISONED IN THEIR GOOD CONSCIENCE
WELL HAVE I BURIED THEE IN THY HOLLOW TREE
NONE OF YOU WANT TO ENTER INTO THE DEATH-BOAT
I SHOULD LIKE TO ROB THOSE I HAVE GIFTED:--THUS DO I HUNGER FOR WICKEDNESS
IT SURPASSETH EVEN FORGIVENESS AND PITY
FOR A SHADOW CAME UNTO ME--THE STILLEST AND LIGHTEST OF ALL THINGS ONCE CAME UNTO ME
RATHER IS IT OF ALL ARTS THE FINEST SUBTLEST LAST AND PATIENTEST
THEY PLAY AND WISH PEOPLE TO BE FOND OF BEHOLDING THEM--ALL THEIR SPIRIT IS IN THIS WISH
WHAT IS THAT
BUT WITH THEE DO MY NOSTRILS TASTE THEIR GREATEST DELIGHT
NOTHING HAVE I KEPT HIDDEN FROM YOU MY FRIENDS
LOVE TO MAN WOULD BE FATAL TO ME ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED
AND THIS MOST UPRIGHT EXISTENCE THE EGO--IT SPEAKETH OF THE BODY AND STILL IMPLIETH THE BODY EVEN WHEN IT MUSETH AND RAVETH AND FLUTTERETH WITH BROKEN WINGS
LIGHTNING OF MY WISDOM
CREATING--THAT IS THE GREAT SALVATION FROM SUFFERING AND LIFE'S ALLEVIATION
THUS ALL THINGS BECOME HIS DOWN-GOING
WE GO TOGETHER OPENLY THROUGH OPEN DOORS
WHEN THE GREAT MAN CRIETH
WE HAVE NOW HEARD ENOUGH OF THE ROPE-DANCER
MY HEALTH WAS NOT VERY GOOD
UNGRACIOUS IS MY TASTE TOWARDS ALL THOSE SELF-ENGROSSED ONES
FREED AT LAST IS MY NOSE FROM THE SMELL OF ALL HUMAN HUBBUB
I KNOW YOU
I KNOW YOU
MUCH FOUND I HERE CALLED BAD WHICH WAS THERE DECKED WITH PURPLE HONOURS
ONCE HADST THOU WILD DOGS IN THY CELLAR
ALL CLOUDS DID I BLOW AWAY FROM IT
O MY BRETHREN HE WHO IS A FIRSTLING IS EVER SACRIFICED
THEREFORE MUST I STILL BE A LONG TIME MERRILY UPON MY LEGS
IT PROSTRATED ME
GREATLY WAS HE HONOURED AND REWARDED FOR IT AND ALL THE YOUTHS SAT BEFORE HIS CHAIR
HARDLY HAVE I ESCAPED FROM THAT MAGICIAN AND MUST ANOTHER NECROMANCER AGAIN RUN ACROSS MY PATH SOME SORCERER WITH LAYING-ON-OF-HANDS SOME SOMBRE WONDER-WORKER BY THE GRACE OF GOD SOME ANOINTED WORLD-MALIGNER WHOM MAY THE DEVIL TAKE
WHEN HE WAS YOUNG THAT GOD OUT OF THE ORIENT THEN WAS HE HARSH AND REVENGEFUL AND BUILT HIMSELF A HELL FOR THE DELIGHT OF HIS FAVOURITES
THANK GOD THAT I AM NOT LIKE THEE!"--ONLY THIS SELF-GLORIFYING SENTIMENT CAN LEND A WELL-CONSTITUTED MAN THE IMPUDENCE TO SHOW HIS PITY FOR THE CRIPPLE AND THE ILL-CONSTITUTED
EVERY PEOPLE SPEAKETH ITS LANGUAGE OF GOOD AND EVIL
THUS TEACHETH ZARATHUSTRA:--SO SHALL YE PASS AWAY
IN VERSES 31 AND 32 HE TELLS US TO WHAT EXTENT HE HAD TO MODIFY HIMSELF IN ORDER TO BE ENDURED BY HIS FELLOWS WHOM HE LOVED SEE ALSO VERSE 12 IN MANLY PRUDENCE NIETZSCHE'S GREAT LOVE FOR HIS FELLOWS WHICH HE CONFESSES IN THE PROLOGUE AND WHICH IS AT THE ROOT OF ALL HIS TEACHING SEEMS RATHER TO ELUDE THE DISCERNING POWERS OF THE AVERAGE PHILANTHROPIST AND MODERN MAN
AND IN ALL MATTERS WE HAVE THE OPINION THAT IS GIVEN US AND AGAIN THERE ARE THOSE WHO LOVE ATTITUDES AND THINK THAT VIRTUE IS A SORT OF ATTITUDE
OR SHOULD WE PERHAPS GO TO HIM NOW DOTH IT COME TO PASS THAT SOLITUDE ITSELF BECOMETH FRAGILE AND BREAKETH OPEN LIKE A GRAVE THAT BREAKETH OPEN AND CAN NO LONGER HOLD ITS DEAD
A PHILANTHROPY THAT SACRIFICES THE MINORITY OF THE PRESENT-DAY FOR THE MAJORITY CONSTITUTING POSTERITY COMPLETELY EVADES HIS MENTAL GRASP AND NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE IT DECLARES CHRISTIAN VALUES TO BE A DANGER TO THE FUTURE OF OUR KIND IS THEREFORE SHELVED AS BRUTAL COLD AND HARD SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER XXXVI NIETZSCHE TRIED TO BE ALL THINGS TO ALL MEN
OBEY MUST THE WOMAN AND FIND A DEPTH FOR HER SURFACE
IF WE MENTION IT WITH FAVOUR WE MAY BE REGARDED HOWEVER UNJUSTLY AS THE ADVOCATE OF SAVAGES SATYRS AND PURE SENSUALITY
THE POPULACE HOWEVER KNOWETH NOT WHAT IS GREAT AND WHAT IS SMALL WHAT IS STRAIGHT AND WHAT IS HONEST
HE WOULD MAKE THEM HARDER
EVEN VIRTUES MAY SUCCUMB BY JEALOUSY
MY POISON IS FATAL ZARATHUSTRA SMILED
IN INDULGING AND PITYING LAY EVER MY GREATEST DANGER
HAVE YE NOT MADE MINE ETERNAL SHORT AS A TONE DIETH AWAY IN A COLD NIGHT
WHAT ARE THE THREE BEST CURSED THINGS IN THE WORLD
SHARP BECOMETH THE SOUL OF SUCH PRISONERS BUT ALSO DECEITFUL AND WICKED
HAD I THUS COME IN VAIN INTO THESE FORESTS AND MOUNTAINS
WHITHER PULLEST THOU ME NOW THOU PARAGON AND TOMBOY
ANOTHER SOUGHT A HANDMAID WITH THE VIRTUES OF AN ANGEL
AND WHATEVER BELONGETH UNTO ME IN ALL SEAS MY IN-AND-FOR-ME IN ALL THINGS--FISH THAT OUT FOR ME BRING THAT UP TO ME
READ THEN THE RIDDLE THOU HARD NUT-CRACKER,--THE RIDDLE THAT I AM
NO ONE CAN PROVE IT UNLESS HE HIMSELF PROVE IT
STAND STILL
HE WAS COUNTER TO THE TASTE OF MINE EARS AND EYES
THIS DISCOURSE CONTAINS PERHAPS THE BOLDEST OF NIETZSCHE'S SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING ATHEISM AS WELL AS SOME EXTREMELY PENETRATING REMARKS UPON THE SENTIMENT OF PITY
THOU GNASHEST ON ME SWEETLY WITH LITTLE WHITE TEETH
THOU WILT HAVE TO DANCE LEST THOU TUMBLE DOWN
WHEN I CAME UNTO MEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THEN DID I COMMIT THE ANCHORITE FOLLY THE GREAT FOLLY
HIS FRIENDS CAUSED HIM MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS WHICH WERE THE MORE BITTER TO HIM INASMUCH AS HE REGARDED FRIENDSHIP AS SUCH A SACRED INSTITUTION
THEN HE AROSE QUICKLY LIKE A SEAFARER WHO ALL AT ONCE SEETH THE LAND
IT IS MY SYMPATHY WITH ALL THE PAST THAT I SEE IT IS ABANDONED ABANDONED TO THE FAVOUR THE SPIRIT AND THE MADNESS OF EVERY GENERATION THAT COMETH AND REINTERPRETETH ALL THAT HATH BEEN AS ITS BRIDGE
PRAISED BE THIS DAY WHICH ENTICED ME INTO THE SWAMP
SUCH PERSONS VAUNT ABOUT NOT LYING
BUT ZARATHUSTRA WHO HAD JUST COME BACK INTO HIS CAVE AND HAD HEARD AND DIVINED THE LAST DISCOURSE THREW A HANDFUL OF ROSES TO THE CONSCIENTIOUS ONE AND LAUGHED ON ACCOUNT OF HIS TRUTHS WHY HE EXCLAIMED WHAT DID I HEAR JUST NOW
THEY ARE THE PHARISEES BUT PEOPLE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
THE TRANSLATION OF MORALITY INTO THE METAPHYSICAL AS FORCE CAUSE END IN ITSELF WAS HIS WORK
MY TO-DAY REFUTETH MY YESTERDAY
HAVE PITY UPON THY FOOT
BETTER BE A FOOL ON ONE'S OWN ACCOUNT THAN A SAGE ON OTHER PEOPLE'S APPROBATION
HOW MANY THINGS ARE NOW CALLED THE WORST WICKEDNESS WHICH ARE ONLY TWELVE FEET BROAD AND THREE MONTHS LONG
RATHER SEEMEST THOU TO ME A PLANT-EATER AND A ROOT-MAN
LO
LO
LO
LO
LO
LO
LO
LO
LO
LO
LO
LO
THEREFORE MUST I DESCEND INTO THE DEEP
WHAT AM I TO THINK OF IT SAID ZARATHUSTRA
ART THOU ONE ENTITLED TO ESCAPE FROM A YOKE
WHAT DOTH IT CONCERN ME
TEN DAYS SUFFICED
AND IF IN TRUTH THE ASS DID NOT DANCE THAT EVENING THERE NEVERTHELESS HAPPENED THEN GREATER AND RARER WONDERS THAN THE DANCING OF AN ASS WOULD HAVE BEEN
WHILE WRITING THIS NIETZSCHE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN THINKING OF THE ISLAND OF ISCHIA WHICH WAS ULTIMATELY DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE
I TREAD ALL PATHS TO DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
CALLED OUT ZARATHUSTRA LONG HAVE THY SPEECH AND THY SPECIES DISGUSTED ME
LEAST OF ALL HOWEVER CAN THE GOOD BE TRUE
ALL IS EMPTY ALL IS ALIKE ALL HATH BEEN AND FROM ALL HILLS THERE RE-ECHOED
THOSE WHO HASTILY CLASS HIM WITH THE ANARCHISTS OR THE PROGRESSIVISTS OF THE LAST CENTURY FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE HIGH ESTEEM IN WHICH HE ALWAYS HELD BOTH LAW AND DISCIPLINE
OTHERWISE WOULD HE HAVE RAGED LESS BECAUSE PEOPLE DID NOT LOVE HIM
LAUGHTER FLITTETH FROM HIM LIKE A VARIEGATED CLOUD
FOR SINGING IS FOR THE CONVALESCENT
YE CONSTRAIN ALL THINGS TO FLOW TOWARDS YOU AND INTO YOU SO THAT THEY SHALL FLOW BACK AGAIN OUT OF YOUR FOUNTAIN AS THE GIFTS OF YOUR LOVE
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THEE ALONE MY BROTHER
HOW HAVE I FREED MYSELF FROM LOATHING
THE EVILEST IS NECESSARY FOR THE SUPERMAN'S BEST
LET NO FALSE VALUES IMPOSE UPON YOU
YE LACK INNOCENCE IN YOUR DESIRE
AND THUS SPAKE THE WISE MAN
THERE WHERE THE STATE CEASETH--THERE ONLY COMMENCETH THE MAN WHO IS NOT SUPERFLUOUS
THEY ARE THE SUPERMAN'S GREATEST DANGER
GAZING ON THEE I TREMBLE WITH DIVINE DESIRES
WHEN HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA HAD GONE ROUND A ROCK THEN SAW HE ON THE SAME PATH NOT FAR BELOW HIM A MAN WHO THREW HIS LIMBS ABOUT LIKE A MANIAC AND AT LAST TUMBLED TO THE GROUND ON HIS BELLY
HOW I MOCK AT MY VIOLENT PANTING
OH FOR THE GOLDEN ROUND BALL GET UP SAID ZARATHUSTRA THOU LITTLE THIEF THOU SLUGGARD
THEN BECAME THEY THY VIRTUES AND JOYS
AND IN WE PHILOLOGISTS THE FOLLOWING REMARKABLE OBSERVATIONS OCCUR HOW CAN ONE PRAISE AND GLORIFY A NATION AS A WHOLE?--EVEN AMONG THE GREEKS IT WAS THE INDIVIDUALS THAT COUNTED THE GREEKS ARE INTERESTING AND EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY REARED SUCH A VAST NUMBER OF GREAT INDIVIDUALS
AND WHEN THE LONG TWILIGHT COMETH AND THE MORTAL WEARINESS EVEN THEN WILT THOU NOT DISAPPEAR FROM OUR FIRMAMENT THOU ADVOCATE OF LIFE
MY FRIENDS THERE HATH ARISEN A SATIRE ON YOUR FRIEND
SO HAVE I FOUND IT
IT IS THE HIGHEST TIME THE WORD BLEW TO ME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AND SAID COME THE DOOR SPRANG SUBTLELY OPEN UNTO ME AND SAID GO BUT I LAY ENCHAINED TO MY LOVE FOR MY CHILDREN
DISTINGUISH BY ACCEPTING!"--THUS DO I ADVISE THOSE WHO HAVE NAUGHT TO BESTOW
THERE IS THE WISDOM OF A GOD THEREIN
BECAUSE THOU ART GENTLE AND OF UPRIGHT CHARACTER THOU SAYEST
FROM THENCE THERE YET COMETH UNTO MEN A HEAVY CLOUD
I DO NOT SEE THAT I AM FERVOUR AND FUEL
AS A DELICATE WIND DANCETH INVISIBLY UPON PARQUETED SEAS LIGHT FEATHER-LIGHT SO--DANCETH SLEEP UPON ME
THAT IS WHY AFTER HAVING TESTED THE WORTH OF OUR NOBLEST IDEAL--THAT OF THE SAVIOUR IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEW VALUATIONS THE POET CRIES WITH PASSIONATE EMPHASIS IN ZARATHUSTRA
IS THY SPIRIT NOT TOO CLEANLY FOR THIS PRAYING AND THE FUMES OF THOSE DEVOTEES THERE IS SOMETHING THEREIN SAID THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE AND PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS NOSE THERE IS SOMETHING IN THIS SPECTACLE WHICH EVEN DOETH GOOD TO MY CONSCIENCE
I SIT AT THE GATEWAY FOR EVERY ROGUE AND ASK
EXCEPT THAT HE EVER SAITH YEA TO THE WORLD WHICH HE CREATED
AT THEM SHEEP'S CLAWS SHALL NOT GRASP
O MY GUESTS YE STRANGE ONES--HAVE YE YET HEARD NOTHING OF MY CHILDREN
WHEN WRITING THIS PASSAGE NIETZSCHE WAS OBVIOUSLY THINKING OF THE ACCUSATIONS WHICH WERE LEVELLED AT THE EARLY CHRISTIANS BY THEIR PAGAN CONTEMPORARIES
SO DID I ASK MYSELF
THEREFORE DO I NOW AVOID MY HAPPINESS AND PRESENT MYSELF TO EVERY MISFORTUNE--FOR MY FINAL TESTING AND RECOGNITION
AND VERILY IT IS THE STRANGEST THING IN A WISE MAN IF OVER AND ABOVE HE BE STILL SENSIBLE AND NOT AN ASS THUS SPAKE THE KING ON THE RIGHT AND WONDERED
WHEN HOWEVER HE HAD ACTUALLY FOUND WORDS BEHOLD
TO BE SURE LITTLE OF A MAN IS HE ALSO THAT TIMID NIGHT-REVELLER
WITHDRAWING MY HAND WHEN ANOTHER HAND ALREADY STRETCHETH OUT TO IT
NOW WILL A STRONG WIND EVER COME VICTORIOUSLY UNTO ALL MORTAL WEARINESS
THEREFORE DO I HERE WAIT CRAFTY AND SCORNFUL UPON HIGH MOUNTAINS NO IMPATIENT ONE NO PATIENT ONE
TEN TIMES MUST THOU RECONCILE AGAIN WITH THYSELF
IT IS HOWEVER A SHAME TO PRAY
A DRUNKEN SWEET LYRE A MIDNIGHT-LYRE A BELL-FROG WHICH NO ONE UNDERSTANDETH BUT WHICH MUST SPEAK BEFORE DEAF ONES YE HIGHER MEN
NOT THE COURAGE BEFORE WITNESSES BUT ANCHORITE AND EAGLE COURAGE WHICH NOT EVEN A GOD ANY LONGER BEHOLDETH
WHAT DOST THOU SEEK HERE CALLED OUT ZARATHUSTRA IN ASTONISHMENT
SO DOTH IT ACCORD WITH GOOD SLEEP
SO DOTH IT ACCORD WITH GOOD SLEEP
THE ASS HOWEVER WITH ILL-WILL SAID YE-A TO HIS REMARK
UP THITHER LEADETH THE WAY THERE IS THE CAVE OF ZARATHUSTRA
I STAND NOW BEFORE MY LAST SUMMIT AND BEFORE THAT WHICH HATH BEEN LONGEST RESERVED FOR ME
THERE THEY AT LAST STOOD STILL BESIDE ONE ANOTHER
HE WHO COMMANDETH GREAT THINGS
SUMMIT AND ABYSS--THESE ARE NOW COMPRISED TOGETHER
THESE ARE MERE MEANS ADOPTED BY ALL IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE POWER TO MAINTAIN THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD OR TO BECOME SUPREME
LONESOMENESS COWERED BESIDE HER
THESE MASTERS OF TO-DAY--SURPASS THEM O MY BRETHREN--THESE PETTY PEOPLE
THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE IS INDEED THE ONLY SPUR IN THE CASE OF SUCH PEOPLE
BUT SOMETHING BETTER DID I ALWAYS SEEM TO DO WHEN I HAD LEARNED TO ENJOY MYSELF BETTER
TO WHOM HATH THERE EVER FALLEN SUCH ROSY APPLES FROM THE TREE AS HAVE FALLEN UNTO ME
HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY FOND OF HIS FELLOWS FOR THAT
FOR THAT WOULD ABASH HIM
MINE OWN FORERUNNER AM I AMONG THIS PEOPLE MINE OWN COCKCROW IN DARK LANES
IT HATH GROWN UP HIGH ABOVE MAN AND BEAST
I--GO TO THE BASIS
THEREWITH DANCETH MAN OVER EVERYTHING
WITH TONES DANCETH OUR LOVE ON VARIEGATED RAINBOWS O ZARATHUSTRA SAID THEN HIS ANIMALS TO THOSE WHO THINK LIKE US THINGS ALL DANCE THEMSELVES
JUST NOW HATH MY WORLD BECOME PERFECT MIDNIGHT IS ALSO MID-DAY PAIN IS ALSO A JOY CURSE IS ALSO A BLESSING NIGHT IS ALSO A SUN,--GO AWAY
YE ARE THE BEST BRAGGARTS AND HAVE SUFFICIENTLY LEARNED THE ART OF MAKING DREGS BOIL
NOW ONLY DO I KNOW AND FEEL HOW I LOVE YOU MINE ANIMALS AND ZARATHUSTRA SAID ONCE MORE
IF THE MINOR POET AND PHILOSOPHER HAS MADE US SHY OF THE PROPHETIC SERIOUSNESS WHICH CHARACTERIZED AN ISAIAH OR A JEREMIAH IT IS SURELY OUR LOSS AND THE MINOR POET'S GAIN
FROM FIRST TO LAST IT IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE AS AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
THERE WAS IT ALSO WHERE I PICKED UP FROM THE PATH THE WORD SUPERMAN AND THAT MAN IS SOMETHING THAT MUST BE SURPASSED
EXHAUSTED I SEE THEE BY POISONOUS FLIES
THAT HOWEVER IS THE CREATING GOOD LET US SPEAK THEREOF YE WISEST ONES EVEN THOUGH IT BE BAD
AND WHAT HAPPENS
AND GLORY AND HONOUR AND WISDOM AND THANKS AND PRAISE AND STRENGTH BE TO OUR GOD FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING
THOU SHALT FOR THOU MUST THEN AGAIN DID ONE DISTRUST ALL SOOTHSAYERS AND ASTROLOGERS
FROM ALL MOUNTAINS DO I LOOK OUT FOR FATHERLANDS AND MOTHERLANDS
ROME NOW HATH TURNED HARLOT AND HARLOT-STEW ROME'S CAESAR A BEAST AND GOD--HATH TURNED JEW
THUS SPEAKETH THE DRAGON
THIS ART KNOWETH HE BETTER THAN ANY ONE I HAVE SEEN
AGAIN WHEN THE FRIENDSHIP RIPENED WE CANNOT WELL IMAGINE NIETZSCHE THE YOUNGER MAN BEING ANYTHING LESS THAN INTOXICATED BY HIS SENIOR'S ATTENTION AND LOVE AND WE ARE THEREFORE NOT SURPRISED TO FIND HIM PRESSING WAGNER FORWARD AS THE GREAT REFORMER AND SAVIOUR OF MANKIND
26
THOU MUST YET BECOME A CHILD AND BE WITHOUT SHAME
IN APHORISM 31 OF THE ANTICHRIST HE SAYS THAT HE NIETZSCHE ALWAYS PURGED HIS PICTURE OF THE HUMBLE NAZARENE OF ALL THOSE BITTER AND SPITEFUL OUTBURSTS WHICH IN VIEW OF THE STRUGGLE THE FIRST CHRISTIANS WENT THROUGH MAY VERY WELL HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTER BY APOLOGISTS AND SECTARIANS WHO AT THAT TIME COULD ILL AFFORD TO CONSIDER NICE PSYCHOLOGICAL POINTS SEEING THAT WHAT THEY NEEDED ABOVE ALL WAS A WRANGLING AND ABUSIVE DEITY
GOD'S WOE IS DEEPER THOU STRANGE WORLD
THE SUBLIME ONES
THE SUBLIME ONES
THE SUBLIME ONES
AND WHEN WE SWEAT THEN DO PEOPLE SAY TO US
THEY ARE FULSOME OBTRUSIVE DOGS
OF ITS OWN ACCORD MUST IT EVER SURPASS ITSELF ANEW
THOSE HALF-AND-HALF ONES THAT HAVE NEITHER LEARNED TO BLESS NOR TO CURSE FROM THE HEART
OF HIS PITY FOR MAN HATH GOD DIED."--ZARATHUSTRA II THE PITIFUL LXI
WAIT A LITTLE AS YET HAVE I NO TIME FOR THEE TOWARDS HIMSELF MAN IS THE CRUELLEST ANIMAL
BUT HE WHO IS NOT AFRAID OF MY DARKNESS WILL FIND BANKS FULL OF ROSES UNDER MY CYPRESSES
WERE IT OTHERWISE THEN WOULD THE TARANTULAS TEACH OTHERWISE
ALL THE SECRETS OF YOUR HEART SHALL BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT
THERE IS ONE THAT MUST FIRST COME ONE WHO WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH ONCE MORE A GOOD JOVIAL BUFFOON A DANCER A WIND A WILD ROMP SOME OLD FOOL:--WHAT THINK YE
MY MOUTHPIECE--IS OF THE PEOPLE
THOU OWL
IN REGARD TO THE ACTUAL PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS EXPOUNDED IN THIS WORK THERE IS AN EXCELLENT WAY OF CLEARING UP ANY DIFFICULTIES THEY MAY PRESENT AND THAT IS BY AN APPEAL TO NIETZSCHE'S OTHER WORKS
FLEE FROM THEIR INVISIBLE VENGEANCE
TOWARDS THEE THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT VENGEANCE
MEN ARE NOT EQUAL HE SEES PRECISELY IN THIS INEQUALITY A PURPOSE TO BE SERVED A CONDITION TO BE EXPLOITED
THEY ARE OLD PEOPLE
IT WANTETH TO PLAY
I WOULD THAT ALL MEN WERE EVEN AS I MYSELF NOW NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY MIGHT BE CALLED AN ATTEMPT AT GIVING BACK TO HEALTHY AND NORMAL MEN INNOCENCE AND A CLEAN CONSCIENCE IN THEIR DESIRES--NOT TO APPLAUD THE VULGAR SENSUALISTS WHO RESPOND TO EVERY STIMULUS AND WHOSE PASSIONS ARE OUT OF HAND
AND ALREADY ARE THEY MYSTIFIERS AND MUMBLERS AND MOLLYCODDLES
FIRST THAT IN ORDER TO CREATE ONE MUST BE AS A LITTLE CHILD
AS BUCKLE SUGGESTS IN HIS INFLUENCE OF WOMEN ON THE PROGRESS OF KNOWLEDGE THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT OF THE INVESTIGATOR IS BOTH HELPED AND SUPPLEMENTED BY THE LATTER'S EMOTIONS AND PERSONALITY AND THE DIVORCE OF ALL EMOTIONALISM AND INDIVIDUAL TEMPERAMENT FROM SCIENCE IS A FATAL STEP TOWARDS STERILITY
FOURTH AND LAST PART
FOURTH AND LAST PART
IMPATIENT MUST THEY NOW BE THOSE BIG ALARM-DRUMS WHICH FIND A VOICE NOW OR NEVER
THIS HOWEVER IS MY BLESSING
THAT OF THE WEAK AND SUBORDINATE CLASS HE CALLS SLAVE-MORALITY
BUT AT THIS POINT IN HIS DISCOURSE IT CHANCED THAT ZARATHUSTRA SUDDENLY PAUSED AND LOOKED LIKE A PERSON IN THE GREATEST ALARM
SO THAT THEIR FATIGUE HATH AT LAST TO GO TO SLEEP ON THE SNOW
THERE ARE EVEN THOSE WHO NARRATE THAT THE ASS THEN DANCED
AND WITH PUPILS ONE MAY WELL TELL TALES OUT OF SCHOOL
AND YE--YE HAVE MADE A LYRE-LAY OUT OF IT
ZARATHUSTRA SAID HE WILT THOU EVEN SING CONSOLATION TO THE SEA
ALAS HOW WILT THOU FOREGO AND FORGET THAT LOSS
BESIDE THE BAD CONSCIENCE HATH HITHERTO GROWN ALL KNOWLEDGE
OH THE CRAVING TO CRAVE
AND JUST ACKNOWLEDGE IT
ZARATHUSTRA CALLETH THEE ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS
BELIEVE ME MY FRIENDS
THE WORLD HERE IS STRANGE TO ME AND REMOTE
CHAPTER XLVIII
WITH A WICKEDNESS DO I BEGIN EVERY DAY
AND ONCE DID I WANT TO DANCE AS I HAD NEVER YET DANCED
THEY BITE AT IT MY BAIT TAKETH THERE DEPARTETH ALSO FROM THEM THEIR ENEMY THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY
IF MY WICKEDNESS BE A LAUGHING WICKEDNESS AT HOME AMONG ROSE-BANKS AND HEDGES OF LILIES
AND SHOULD A GREAT INJUSTICE BEFALL YOU THEN DO QUICKLY FIVE SMALL ONES BESIDES
WILD AND STRANGE EVEN WHEN THEY LOVE THEE
THOU PEACOCK OF PEACOCKS THOU SEA OF VANITY
FOR KNOW IT THAT I AM THE LAST POPE!--A FESTIVAL OF PIOUS RECOLLECTIONS AND DIVINE SERVICES
NOT PERHAPS YE YOURSELVES MY BRETHREN
THOU HUNTSMAN HIND THE CLOUD-BANKS
WITH THIS DO I COME INDEED OUT OF EUROPE THAT DOUBT'TH MORE EAGERLY THAN DOTH ANY ELDERLY MARRIED WOMAN
BUT I WOULD FAIN FIND THEE AGAIN
OF WHAT ACCOUNT TO ME ARE MARKET-PLACE AND POPULACE AND POPULACE-NOISE AND LONG POPULACE-EARS YE HIGHER MEN LEARN THIS FROM ME
HERE BRISTLED ALOFT BLACK AND RED CLIFFS WITHOUT ANY GRASS TREE OR BIRD'S VOICE
AND IN TRUTH WHEN IT TURNED CLEAR BEFORE HIM THERE LAY A YELLOW POWERFUL ANIMAL AT HIS FEET RESTING ITS HEAD ON HIS KNEE,--UNWILLING TO LEAVE HIM OUT OF LOVE AND DOING LIKE A DOG WHICH AGAIN FINDETH ITS OLD MASTER
THAT DISTINCTION DID I UNLEARN,--THEN DID I FLEE AWAY FURTHER AND EVER FURTHER UNTIL I CAME TO THOSE KINE THUS SPAKE THE PEACEFUL ONE AND PUFFED HIMSELF AND PERSPIRED WITH HIS WORDS
FEAR THEREFORE NOTHING ANY MORE THE MAN LOOKED UP DISTRUSTFULLY
WHAT IS INDISPENSABLE AND HARD THEY CALL GOOD
PERHAPS HOWEVER YE HAVE FOUND ON YOUR WAY WHAT I SEEK
TAKE HEART
THAT ALL THINGS ETERNALLY RETURN AND OURSELVES WITH THEM AND THAT WE HAVE ALREADY EXISTED TIMES WITHOUT NUMBER AND ALL THINGS WITH US
BUT NEITHER GREAT RACES NOR GREAT CASTES HAVE EVER BEEN BUILT UP IN THIS WAY
AND LONG DIDST THOU BELONG TO THE HERD
AWAY WITH ME PASSION FOR POWER
TO LIVE--THAT IS TO THRASH STRAW
THE STING OF CONSCIENCE TEACHETH ONE TO STING
ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF WHILE RELATING HIS EXPERIENCE WITH THE FIRE-DOG TO HIS DISCIPLES FAILS TO GET THEM INTERESTED IN HIS NARRATIVE AND WE ALSO MAY BE ONLY TOO READY TO TURN OVER THESE PAGES UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE LITTLE MORE THAN A MERE PHANTASY OR POETICAL FLIGHT
HE SAYS THEY LACK INNOCENCE IN THEIR DESIRES AND THEREFORE SLANDER ALL DESIRING
A POOR BED WARMETH ME MORE THAN A RICH ONE FOR I AM JEALOUS OF MY POVERTY
BUT DO NOT AFFECT TO BE SO DELICATE
WHAT NO ONE'S EYE HATH YET SEEN NAMELY THE FRUIT--THIS SHELTERETH AND SAVETH AND NOURISHETH YOUR ENTIRE LOVE
AND THAT SHE STEALETH TO THEIR EAR TO WHISPER SECRETS INTO IT AND AMOROUS FLATTERIES
O ZARATHUSTRA SAID THEY IT IS CONSEQUENTLY FOR THAT REASON THAT THOU THYSELF ALWAYS BECOMETH YELLOWER AND DARKER ALTHOUGH THY HAIR LOOKETH WHITE AND FLAXEN
BY OUR BEST ENEMIES WE DO NOT WANT TO BE SPARED NOR BY THOSE EITHER WHOM WE LOVE FROM THE VERY HEART
THEN WILT THOU ALSO HEAL THY PATIENT
THE HUMAN WORLD IS JUST AS DEPENDENT UPON WOMEN'S POWERS AS UPON MEN'S
IS IT NOT BECAUSE HE HATH HAD TO BE ASHAMED TOO OFT
IT WAS THE BODY WHICH DESPAIRED OF THE EARTH--IT HEARD THE BOWELS OF EXISTENCE SPEAKING UNTO IT
FOR IT MOCKETH AND BEFOOLETH ALL ERRING MISINFERRING TEACHERS
SO VAIN ARE THEY
DID YE LIKE TO LOOK AT MY GREAT PAIN AS MEN DO
ONE SHOULD LIVE ON MOUNTAINS
BUT STILL MORE IMPERIOUSLY DID MY WILL SPEAK UNTO IT,--THEN DID IT LIE IMPLORINGLY UPON ITS KNEES IMPLORING THAT IT MIGHT FIND HOME AND HEART WITH ME AND SAYING FLATTERINGLY
HIS GLANCES PIERCED AS WITH ARROWS THEIR THOUGHTS AND ARREAR-THOUGHTS
A GOOD SERVANT HOWEVER KNOWETH EVERYTHING AND MANY A THING EVEN WHICH A MASTER HIDETH FROM HIMSELF
WHAT AM I
NOW DO I SEE MYSELF UNDER MYSELF
NOW IT DWELLETH WITH US--LET IT STAY AS LONG AS IT WILL THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
YES
AND WHAT WAS ONCE CALLED THE SECRET AND SECRECY OF PROFOUND SOULS BELONGETH TO-DAY TO THE STREET-TRUMPETERS AND OTHER BUTTERFLIES
WHO AM I
BUT STILL HE KNEW THEM NOT
THERE LOOKEDST THOU WITH THE GRIMACE OF A DEVIL AND SNEERINGLY
WAS THAT--LIFE WILL I SAY UNTO DEATH
AND AS A THIRD DEATH-RATTLE STILLNESS THE WORST OF MY FEMALE FRIENDS
BUT STILL AM I FAR FROM THEM AND MY SENSE SPEAKETH NOT UNTO THEIR SENSE
I AM THY COCK AND MORNING DAWN THOU OVERSLEPT REPTILE
THAT IS WEIGHT AT THE SAME TIME AND SCALES AND WEIGHER
LET THY PITY BE A DIVINING
BEFORE THEY ARE UTTERED THEY ARE FULL OF THE MODESTY OF A VIRGIN AND OFTEN THE OLDEST SAGE WILL BLUSH LIKE A GIRL WHEN THIS VIRGINITY IS VIOLATED BY AN INDISCRETION WHICH FORCES HIM TO REVEAL HIS DEEPEST THOUGHTS
THAT IS NOT THE WORST TASTE IN THESE DAYS YE MAY VERILY ALL OF YOU BE HIGHER MEN CONTINUED ZARATHUSTRA
BITE!"--SO CRIED IT OUT OF ME
THUS IT THOUGHT TO ESCAPE FROM THE BODY AND THE EARTH
DEEP IS ITS WOE JOY--DEEPER STILL THAN GRIEF CAN BE
TO THEIR MEMORY DO I DEPOSIT THIS WREATH AND THIS CURSE
AND THEREFORE HAVE YE BECOME DESPISERS OF THE BODY
AND NOT ONLY THE LONG-EARED AND SHORT-SIGHTED FALL UPON THEIR KNEES
THAT THE MOUNTAINS MAY COME TO THE VALLEYS AND THE WINDS OF THE HEIGHTS TO THE PLAINS OH WHO COULD FIND THE RIGHT PRENOMEN AND HONOURING NAME FOR SUCH LONGING
THUS BEGAN ZARATHUSTRA'S DOWN-GOING
CHAPTER XLIV
IN OFFERING THIS LITTLE COMMENTARY TO THE NIETZSCHE STUDENT I SHOULD LIKE IT TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT I MAKE NO CLAIM AS TO ITS INFALLIBILITY OR INDISPENSABILITY
THEY SHUN THE FIRE BECAUSE IT HATH BURNT THEM
THUS DO THEY ALSO WAIT AND GAPE AT THE THOUGHTS WHICH OTHERS HAVE THOUGHT
THOU IMPLANTEDST THY HIGHEST AIM INTO THE HEART OF THOSE PASSIONS
A GOD WILT THOU CREATE FOR THYSELF OUT OF THY SEVEN DEVILS
WHERE IS INNOCENCE
HE SAW THE POSSIBILITY OF RAISING SOCIETY TO A HIGHER LEVEL AND PREACHED THE PROFOUNDEST OPTIMISM IN CONSEQUENCE
YEA MY FRIEND THE BAD CONSCIENCE ART THOU OF THY NEIGHBOURS
HOW SHE SIGHETH
WHERE
AT LAST IT CAME TO PASS THAT HE FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
AND ALSO IN YOU THERE IS MUCH THAT MAKETH ME LOVE AND HOPE
NOW HOWEVER DOTH IT DRAW ME GOD IS A CONJECTURE
THAT WHICH GIVETH WINGS TO ASSES THAT WHICH MILKETH THE LIONESSES PRAISED BE THAT GOOD UNRULY SPIRIT WHICH COMETH LIKE A HURRICANE UNTO ALL THE PRESENT AND UNTO ALL THE POPULACE WHICH IS HOSTILE TO THISTLE-HEADS AND PUZZLE-HEADS AND TO ALL WITHERED LEAVES AND WEEDS:--PRAISED BE THIS WILD GOOD FREE SPIRIT OF THE STORM WHICH DANCETH UPON FENS AND AFFLICTIONS AS UPON MEADOWS
VERILY NOT AS CREATORS AS PROCREATORS OR AS JUBILATORS DO YE LOVE THE EARTH
HE WHO HATH GIVEN BIRTH SHALL WASH HIS SOUL
SO SAY OTHERS AND LIE NOT
THE OTHER LEG
FOR ENJOYMENT AND INNOCENCE ARE THE MOST BASHFUL THINGS
THE SUN SINKETH
CHAPTER XXXVIII
STILL IS HIS SOIL RICH ENOUGH FOR IT
ZARATHUSTRA IS MY BROTHER'S MOST PERSONAL WORK
FOR ABILITY-TO-STAND IS A MERIT IN COURTIERS
IT MAY BE AN OUTRAGE AGAINST HIS WHOLENESS JUST AS THE LOPPING-OFF OF A LEG WOULD BE
YE OPEN-HEARTED ONES
HOW COULD I YE LIGHT-FOOTED ONES BE HOSTILE TO DIVINE DANCES
O THOU MY WILL
BITTERNESS IS IN THE CUP EVEN OF THE BEST LOVE
BUT IT IS JUST ITS LAW THAT OUT OF CONTEMPT ITS LIFE AND LIVING BEAUTY GROW AGAIN
PITY MAKETH STIFLING AIR FOR ALL FREE SOULS
THEY HAVE LEARNED FROM THE SEA ALSO ITS VANITY
I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY UNTO YOU
AND SINCE THE ASSEMBLED GUESTS ALL SPAKE SIMULTANEOUSLY AND EVEN THE ASS ENCOURAGED THEREBY NO LONGER REMAINED SILENT A LITTLE AVERSION AND SCORN FOR HIS VISITORS CAME OVER ZARATHUSTRA ALTHOUGH HE REJOICED AT THEIR GLADNESS
NEITHER A GOOD NOR A BAD TASTE BUT MY TASTE OF WHICH I HAVE NO LONGER EITHER SHAME OR SECRECY
NOW HAVE YE HEARD ALL AND WHY I HAVE TO RETURN INTO MY SOLITUDE
BUT THY FOOLS'-WORD INJURETH ME EVEN WHEN THOU ART RIGHT
ALL CREATORS ARE HARD ALL GREAT LOVE IS BEYOND THEIR PITY O ZARATHUSTRA HOW WELL VERSED DOST THOU SEEM TO ME IN WEATHER-SIGNS
TERTULLIAN APOLOGIA ETC NIETZSCHE'S OBVIOUS MORAL HOWEVER IS THAT GREAT SCIENTISTS AND THINKERS ONCE THEY HAVE REACHED THE WALL ENCIRCLING SCEPTICISM AND HAVE THEREBY LEARNED TO RECOVER THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE ACT OF BELIEVING AS SUCH USUALLY MANIFEST THE CHANGE IN THEIR OUTLOOK BY FALLING VICTIMS TO THE NARROWEST AND MOST SUPERSTITIOUS OF CREEDS
TALK WITH THE KINGS
TALK WITH THE KINGS
TALK WITH THE KINGS
O ZARATHUSTRA EVERYTHING IS A LIE IN ME
WITH HUNCHBACKS ONE MAY WELL SPEAK IN A HUNCHBACKED WAY VERY GOOD SAID THE HUNCHBACK
THESE THREE THINGS HAVE HITHERTO BEEN BEST CURSED AND HAVE BEEN IN WORST AND FALSEST REPUTE--THESE THREE THINGS WILL I WEIGH HUMANLY WELL
AND WHEN TRUTH HATH ONCE TRIUMPHED THERE THEN ASK YOURSELVES WITH GOOD DISTRUST
SCARCELY HOWEVER WAS THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR GONE IN HASTE AND ZARATHUSTRA AGAIN ALONE WHEN HE HEARD BEHIND HIM A NEW VOICE WHICH CALLED OUT
AND THEREFORE SUFFERETH ONE LITTLE CHILDREN TO COME UNTO ONE TO FORBID THEM BETIMES TO LOVE THEMSELVES--SO CAUSETH THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY
BUT THEIR HOUR COMETH
BUT SEE THAT HONEY IS THERE READY TO HAND YELLOW WHITE GOOD ICE-COOL GOLDEN-COMB-HONEY
THEE THYSELF I WANTED TO PUT TO THE PROOF WHEN I GAVE THIS PERFORMANCE
THEY TICK AND WANT PEOPLE TO CALL TICKING--VIRTUE
BLEEDING I SEE THEE AND TORN AT A HUNDRED SPOTS
BUT IT SHALL BE YOUR CURSE YE IMMACULATE ONES YE PURE DISCERNERS THAT YE SHALL NEVER BRING FORTH EVEN THOUGH YE LIE BROAD AND TEEMING ON THE HORIZON
BUT THY MOUTH WOULD NOT LIKE IT TO DRINK OH THAT CURSED NIMBLE SUPPLE SERPENT AND LURKING-WITCH
HE WHOSE FATHERS WERE INCLINED FOR WOMEN AND FOR STRONG WINE AND FLESH OF WILDBOAR SWINE
THIS REFERS TO ALL THOSE PHILOSOPHERS HITHERTO WHO HAVE RUN IN THE HARNESS OF ESTABLISHED VALUES AND HAVE NOT RISKED THEIR REPUTATION WITH THE PEOPLE IN PURSUIT OF TRUTH
DO I THEN STRIVE AFTER HAPPINESS
DO I THEN STRIVE AFTER HAPPINESS
VERILY NOT THAT YE HAVE SERVED A PRINCE--OF WHAT ACCOUNT ARE PRINCES NOW!--NOR THAT YE HAVE BECOME A BULWARK TO THAT WHICH STANDETH THAT IT MAY STAND MORE FIRMLY
THEREFORE DO THEY LONG SO MUCH FOR A FRIEND AND FOR HIS ELEVATION
ALTERED IS ZARATHUSTRA
AND EXTRAORDINARY
I BECOME THIN--I AM ALMOST EQUAL TO A SHADOW
BUT I HATE TO SEE THE GRINNING MOUTHS AND THE THIRST OF THE UNCLEAN
AT MY DANCE-FRANTIC FOOT DOST THOU CAST A GLANCE A LAUGHING QUESTIONING MELTING THROWN GLANCE
UNTO ALL HAIR-SHIRTED DESPISERS OF THE BODY A STING AND STAKE
WHAT IS LONGING
THUS PASSED WITH THE LONESOME ONE MONTHS AND YEARS
THUS UNDERSTANDETH HE ABOUT DEATH AND LIFE
WHAT DO I KNOW THEREOF
THEN FLEW I QUIVERING LIKE AN ARROW WITH SUN-INTOXICATED RAPTURE
BUT FOR THYSELF THOU HAST NO LIE OR ARTIFICE LEFT,--THOU ART DISENCHANTED TO THYSELF
AWAY FROM ITSELF DOTH IT BANISH EVERYTHING COWARDLY
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SURELY THE VERY REVERSE OF FAVOURABLE
THOU SPEAKEST NOT
AN UNHAPPINESS HATH FAILED TO BEFALL THEE
FAIN WOULD I ALSO MAKE AMENDS TO THY BODY FOR ZARATHUSTRA TREADING UPON THEE WITH HIS FEET
THOU LOVEST ME NOT NEARLY SO MUCH AS THOU SAYEST
YE STRANGE ONES
IN ALL RESPECTS HOWEVER YE MAKE TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE SPIRIT
WHEN I WAS A CHILD IN MY MOST DISTANT CHILDHOOD
FOR FEAR OF WILD ANIMALS--THAT HATH BEEN LONGEST FOSTERED IN MAN INCLUSIVE OF THE ANIMAL WHICH HE CONCEALETH AND FEARETH IN HIMSELF:--ZARATHUSTRA CALLETH IT THE BEAST INSIDE SUCH PROLONGED ANCIENT FEAR AT LAST BECOME SUBTLE SPIRITUAL AND INTELLECTUAL--AT PRESENT ME THINKETH IT IS CALLED SCIENCE THUS SPAKE THE CONSCIENTIOUS ONE
WHOEVER EXTOLLETH HIM AS A GOD OF LOVE DOTH NOT THINK HIGHLY ENOUGH OF LOVE ITSELF
IN THIS DISCOURSE ZARATHUSTRA OPENS HIS EXPOSITION OF THE DOCTRINE OF RELATIVITY IN MORALITY AND DECLARES ALL MORALITY TO BE A MERE MEANS TO POWER
EVERYTHING AS YET SLEEPETH SAID HE
WILL FOR THE THINKABLENESS OF ALL BEING
BUT IT COMETH IT CONSTRAINETH ME ALAS
WHERE SOLITUDE ENDETH THERE BEGINNETH THE MARKET-PLACE
HONOUR THUS--MINE UGLINESS
IN THY FRIEND SHALT THOU LOVE THE SUPERMAN AS THY MOTIVE
FOR IN THE DARK TIME WEIGHETH HEAVIER UPON ONE THAN IN THE LIGHT
INNUMERABLE ARE THEY AND IT IS NOT THY LOT TO BE A FLY-FLAP
FOR THIS IS THE TRUTH
AND IF EVERYTHING HAVE ALREADY EXISTED WHAT THINKEST THOU DWARF OF THIS MOMENT
VERILY TO SUCH MEASURE AND TICKTACK IT LIKETH NEITHER TO DANCE NOR TO STAND STILL
NOW DO I SHAKE MYSELF AND RUN AWAY FROM THEE THAT I MAY AGAIN BECOME DRY
CLEARLY HOWEVER SHALL THINE EYE SHOW UNTO ME
NOT WITH YOU MAY I DESCEND FOR THE LAST TIME
THAT WHICH WAS
THE ANIMAL WITH RED CHEEKS
ONE DAY ONE FESTIVAL WITH ZARATHUSTRA HATH TAUGHT ME TO LOVE THE EARTH
TO-DAY HAST THOU STILL THY COURAGE UNABATED AND THY HOPES
FOR NOT IN VAIN HAD THE UGLIEST MAN PREVIOUSLY GIVEN IT WINE TO DRINK
IT IS THE TRUTH HOWEVER THAT THE GOOD MUST BE PHARISEES--THEY HAVE NO CHOICE
WHAT IT SUFFERED AND CRAVED THE POOR SOUL INTERPRETED TO ITSELF--IT INTERPRETED IT AS MURDEROUS DESIRE AND EAGERNESS FOR THE HAPPINESS OF THE KNIFE
ITS LANGUAGE HATH IT DEVISED FOR ITSELF IN LAWS AND CUSTOMS
THOU ALONE MAKEST THE AIR AROUND THEE STRONG AND CLEAR
CHEER UP
CHEER UP
CHEER UP
CHEER UP
CHEER UP
THUS DO I SHOW THEM ONLY THE ICE AND WINTER OF MY PEAKS--AND NOT THAT MY MOUNTAIN WINDETH ALL THE SOLAR GIRDLES AROUND IT
AND WHEN SHALL I WANT IT?--HE THAT HATH A GOAL AND AN HEIR WANTETH DEATH AT THE RIGHT TIME FOR THE GOAL AND THE HEIR
PARDON ME SAID HE TO THE TRODDEN ONE WHO HAD GOT UP ENRAGED AND HAD SEATED HIMSELF PARDON ME AND HEAR FIRST OF ALL A PARABLE
FOR THE SMALLEST GAP IS MOST DIFFICULT TO BRIDGE OVER
IT BETRAYETH UNTO ME AN OLD WILL TO POWER WHAT IS BELIEVED BY THE PEOPLE AS GOOD AND EVIL
TO REACH ITSELF AGAIN STRUGGLETH EVERY RING AND TURNETH ITSELF
SO DOTH HIS HEART DESIRE
IF YE HAVE DONE SO HOWEVER WELL THEN KILL HIM ALSO THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
TOO GREAT HATH BEEN THE TENSION OF MY CLOUD
HATH NOT THE DANCER HIS EAR--IN HIS TOE
THEN LET THEM SEE TO IT THAT THEIR DYING IS ALL THE MORE A SUCCESS
LIV
LIV
WHY DOST THOU DISTURB THEM
AH THERE IS ICE AROUND ME
THOU HAST REAPED DISGUST AS THY ONE TRUTH
NIETZSCHE EARNESTLY BELIEVED THAT THE ZARATHUSTRA-KINGDOM--HIS DYNASTY OF A THOUSAND YEARS--WOULD ONE DAY COME
FOR THAT I AM TOO RICH RICH IN WHAT IS GREAT FRIGHTFUL UGLIEST MOST UNUTTERABLE
WITH SHARP BREEZES TICKLED AS WITH SPARKLING WINE SNEEZETH MY SOUL SNEEZETH AND SHOUTETH SELF-CONGRATULATINGLY
FOR THEY NEED WARMTH
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO PRESENT ITSELF AS THE READIEST THE CORRECTEST AND THE SIMPLEST MEANS OF EXPRESSION
ONLY THUS AND HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY RIGHT CAN THEIR COMBINED INSTINCTS LEAD TO THE EXCELLENCE OF HUMANITY
ALL IS INDIFFERENT TO THEM SOUNDETH IT PLEASANT TO HAVE PREACHED IN THEIR EARS
IN VAIN DO I STRUGGLE WITH THIS EVIL SPIRIT
YE VENTURERS AND ADVENTURERS AND WHOEVER OF YOU HAVE EMBARKED WITH CUNNING SAILS ON UNEXPLORED SEAS
TO COMPOSE AND COLLECT INTO UNITY WHAT IS FRAGMENT IN MAN AND RIDDLE AND FEARFUL CHANCE AS COMPOSER RIDDLE-READER AND REDEEMER OF CHANCE DID I TEACH THEM TO CREATE THE FUTURE AND ALL THAT HATH BEEN--TO REDEEM BY CREATING
AMONG THE MOST ALIKE DOTH SEMBLANCE DECEIVE MOST DELIGHTFULLY
WE TOOK CARE SAID HE ABOUT WINE I ALONG WITH MY BROTHER THE KING ON THE RIGHT
AND SPURIOUS WISDOM
JEALOUS IS SHE ALWAYS OF THE GLOWS OF MY MORNING-DREAM
ALL ANEW ALL ETERNAL ALL ENLINKED ENLACED AND ENAMOURED OH THEN DID YE LOVE THE WORLD YE ETERNAL ONES YE LOVE IT ETERNALLY AND FOR ALL TIME
IT IS NOT FOR YOU THAT I HAVE WAITED HERE IN THESE MOUNTAINS PLAIN LANGUAGE AND PLAINLY GOOD GOD SAID HERE THE KING ON THE LEFT TO HIMSELF
AND WHEN THEY SAY
THE ODOUR OF DUST-COVERED ETERNITIES DID I BREATHE
WHEN HOWEVER YE HAVE AN ENEMY THEN RETURN HIM NOT GOOD FOR EVIL
TO THE THERE-NAMED SOUTH-FRUITS NOW SIMILAR ALL-TOO-SIMILAR DO I LIE HERE
AND ESPECIALLY ALL THE CUNNING SPURIOUS-WITTED CURIOUS-WITTED FOOLISHNESS OF PRIESTS
HOW IS MAN TO BE MAINTAINED ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER ASKETH AS THE FIRST AND ONLY ONE
NOW HATH MY LAST LONESOMENESS BEGUN
A SELF-ROLLING WHEEL
ONE DOTH NOT BLESS WITH THE HAND ALONE
THAT IS KNOWN BY THOSE WHO WANT TO BE LONG LOVED
I WILL SPEAK UNTO THEM OF THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE THING
THE WILL'S ANTIPATHY TO TIME AND ITS IT WAS VERILY A GREAT FOLLY DWELLETH IN OUR WILL
LET ME RATHER HURRY HENCE LEST I TAKE AUGHT AWAY FROM THEE!"--AND THUS THEY PARTED FROM ONE ANOTHER THE OLD MAN AND ZARATHUSTRA LAUGHING LIKE SCHOOLBOYS
THUS ONCE ON A TIME DID I ALSO CAST MY FANCY BEYOND MAN LIKE ALL BACKWORLDSMEN
WHERE ART THOU
HE WILL HAVE THE WORLD OTHERWISE
PEOPLE HAVE SOMETIMES SAID THAT NIETZSCHE HAD NO SENSE OF HUMOUR
COLD SOULS MULES THE BLIND AND THE DRUNKEN I DO NOT CALL STOUT-HEARTED
AND THEN DID IT RECOGNISE THE EYES OF ZARATHUSTRA WRIGGLED AWKWARDLY AND TRIED TO GET AWAY
THIS GUESTS'-PRESENT DO I SOLICIT OF YOUR LOVE THAT YE SPEAK UNTO ME OF MY CHILDREN
THERE IS NOTHING O ZARATHUSTRA THAT GROWETH MORE PLEASINGLY ON EARTH THAN A LOFTY STRONG WILL
THEIR STIFF WISE MEN
AS A BLIND ONE DID I ONCE WALK IN BLESSED WAYS
ALREADY IN THE LAST OF THE THOUGHTS OUT OF SEASON NIETZSCHE SPEAKS AS FOLLOWS ABOUT MODERN MEN
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WILL GREAT THINGS
ON THE MARKET-PLACE NO ONE BELIEVETH IN HIGHER MEN
THIS THE FINEST AIR DRINKING WITH NOSTRILS OUT-SWELLED LIKE GOBLETS LACKING FUTURE LACKING REMEMBRANCES THUS DO I SIT HERE YE FRIENDLY DAMSELS DEARLY LOVED AND LOOK AT THE PALM-TREE THERE HOW IT TO A DANCE-GIRL LIKE DOTH BOW AND BEND AND ON ITS HAUNCHES BOB ONE DOTH IT TOO WHEN ONE VIEW'TH IT LONG TO A DANCE-GIRL LIKE WHO AS IT SEEM'TH TO ME TOO LONG AND DANGEROUSLY PERSISTENT ALWAYS ALWAYS JUST ON SINGLE LEG HATH STOOD
AN EMANCIPATOR
WHAT IS USUALLY THE COUNTENANCE OF THY FRIEND
FOR FEAR--THAT IS MAN'S ORIGINAL AND FUNDAMENTAL FEELING
NE'ER SANK THE WORLD SO LOW
WITH DEAD WILL FREE FROM THE GRIP AND GREED OF SELFISHNESS--COLD AND ASHY-GREY ALL OVER BUT WITH INTOXICATED MOON-EYES
A LITTLE WISDOM IS INDEED POSSIBLE
HAVE NOT ALL RAILINGS AND GANGWAYS FALLEN INTO THE WATER
SHE SPAKE UNTO ME
NOW RISETH THE DESIRE OF THE SEA WITH ITS THOUSAND BREASTS
THOU KNOWEST IT ZARATHUSTRA BUT THOU DOST NOT SPEAK IT AND AT LAST I ANSWERED LIKE ONE DEFIANT
MEN I DO NOT LOVE
AND WHEN WE LEARN BETTER TO ENJOY OURSELVES THEN DO WE UNLEARN BEST TO GIVE PAIN UNTO OTHERS AND TO CONTRIVE PAIN
THOU LIAR FROM THE VERY HEART
NO AROUND THIS FUTURE IDEAL OF A COMING HUMANITY--THE SUPERMAN--THE POET SPREAD THE VEIL OF BECOMING
WITH A LYING WORD IT FEIGNETH A GOOD CONSCIENCE
MAN IS FOR WOMAN A MEANS
THIS THIS IS WHAT IS ETERNAL IN THE EXISTENCE OF PENALTY THAT EXISTENCE ALSO MUST BE ETERNALLY RECURRING DEED AND GUILT
A POOR IGNORANT WEARINESS UNWILLING EVEN TO WILL ANY LONGER
THE VIRTUE OF THE PILLAR SHALT THOU STRIVE AFTER
ALWAYS TO LOVE MORE THAN YE ARE LOVED AND NEVER BE THE SECOND
THUS DOTH HE EXTOL HIS WORLD
THEIR GOLDEN MATURITY HEALETH THE HEART
DO NOT FORGET THY WHIP THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
THEREFORE DO YE LACK BELIEF
THEN LOOKED HE INQUIRINGLY ALOFT FOR HE HEARD ABOVE HIM THE SHARP CALL OF HIS EAGLE
THUS WILL IT HAVE DELICACY AND SWEETNESS
IN VERSE 30 WE ARE TOLD THAT PITY WAS HIS GREATEST DANGER
YOUR OWN DISCERNMENT SHALL YE FOLLOW OUT TO THE END
IN THE FIRST PART WE READ UNDER THE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE THAT FREEDOM AS AN END IN ITSELF DOES NOT CONCERN ZARATHUSTRA AT ALL
INCLUDING THE PROLOGUE NO VERY GREAT DIFFICULTIES WILL APPEAR
I WILL COMPLETE IT
BUT FOR THAT--I AM NOT BEGGAR ENOUGH
IN THE MUD OF YOUR CONTEMPT LAY THE STATUE
I ALREADY LIE WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HEARD THE WISE MAN THUS SPEAK HE LAUGHED IN HIS HEART
FOR THEY WANT TO RIDE UPON THY BACK
THE PASSING CLOUDS I DETEST--THOSE STEALTHY CATS OF PREY
BUT HE WHO IS HATED BY THE PEOPLE AS THE WOLF BY THE DOGS--IS THE FREE SPIRIT THE ENEMY OF FETTERS THE NON-ADORER THE DWELLER IN THE WOODS
AND VERILY YE HIGHER MEN IT HATH A LONGING OPEN YOUR EYES!--IT HATH A LONGING TO COME NAKED WHETHER MALE OR FEMALE I DO NOT YET KNOW
THIS GLOOM AND CONSOLATION IS OFTEN SPREAD AROUND ME
AN OLD WEARISOME BUSINESS SEEMED TO THEM ALL DISCOURSE ABOUT VIRTUE
KNOW THIS THAT TO EVERYBODY A NOBLE ONE STANDETH IN THE WAY
SO THAT HE NEITHER ANSWERED LOOKS NOR QUESTIONS
STILL ART THOU A PRISONER--IT SEEMETH TO ME--WHO DEVISETH LIBERTY FOR HIMSELF
LET JUST THINE ARM SINK
WILT THOU PREVENT HIM ON MINE HONOUR MY FRIEND ANSWERED ZARATHUSTRA THERE IS NOTHING OF ALL THAT WHEREOF THOU SPEAKEST
TO ASCEND HIGH MOUNTAINS TO TEMPT THE TEMPTER
EVERYTHING LIVING BECAME TO ME HUMAN DUST AND BONES AND MOULDERING PAST
BUT I FATHOM YOUR UNSELFISHNESS THE THOU IS OLDER THAN THE I
AND MANY A ONE WHO HATH GONE INTO THE WILDERNESS AND SUFFERED THIRST WITH BEASTS OF PREY DISLIKED ONLY TO SIT AT THE CISTERN WITH FILTHY CAMEL-DRIVERS
HE HOWEVER WHO WOULD BE A FIRSTLING LET HIM TAKE CARE LEST HE ALSO BECOME A LASTLING
THEY BARK FOR JOY IN THEIR CELLAR WHEN THY SPIRIT ENDEAVOURETH TO OPEN ALL PRISON DOORS
HE CERTAINLY DID NOT HIT THE TRUTH WHO SHOT AT IT THE FORMULA
BUT TAKE THY POISON BACK
BUT HE HATED AND HOOTED US
IMPOTENT TOWARDS WHAT HATH BEEN DONE--IT IS A MALICIOUS SPECTATOR OF ALL THAT IS PAST
BUT COLDLY FLOWETH ALL DEEP KNOWLEDGE
THOU WOULDST PLAY ME FOUL
SO BROAD AND TEEMING DID IT LIE ON THE HORIZON
FOR THE EARTHQUAKE--IT CHOKETH UP MANY WELLS IT CAUSETH MUCH LANGUISHING
HIS DISCIPLES LAUGHED SURE ENOUGH AT THIS TALK
AH THE FILTH OF SOUL IN THE TWAIN
FOR ZARATHUSTRA HAD SPENT AND WASTED THE OLD HONEY TO THE VERY LAST PARTICLE
GLADLY INDEED WOULD I FREE THEE FROM EVIL DREAMS AND WHILE ZARATHUSTRA THUS SPAKE HE LAUGHED AT HIMSELF WITH MELANCHOLY AND BITTERNESS
CHAPTER XXXVII
BUT HE DID NOT HALT WHERE MOST NATURALISTS HAVE HALTED
ONE EVENING WENT ZARATHUSTRA AND HIS DISCIPLES THROUGH THE FOREST
TIRED HAVE I BECOME LIKE ALL CREATORS--OF THE OLD TONGUES
IT IS THE TABLE OF THEIR TRIUMPHS
ALAS IF ANY ONE ELSE EXCEPT ZARATHUSTRA HAD SEEN YOU
FOR THE SPIRIT THUS TO BE GOOD IS A MALADY
BECAUSE NO ONE SUFFICIENTLY FLATTERED THEE:--THEREFORE DIDST THOU SEAT THYSELF BESIDE THIS FILTH THAT THOU MIGHTEST HAVE CAUSE FOR MUCH GRUNTING THAT THOU MIGHTEST HAVE CAUSE FOR MUCH VENGEANCE
HERE FORSOOTH IS THE HOME OF ALL THE PAINTPOTS,"--SAID I
HOW POOR INDEED IS MAN THOUGHT HE IN HIS HEART HOW UGLY HOW WHEEZY HOW FULL OF HIDDEN SHAME
ALL IS PERMITTED AND THEN THEY BECOME MERE WRECKAGE
THOU HEARST ME BREATHING THOU O'ERHEARST MY HEART THOU EVER JEALOUS ONE
ME--WANTST THOU
MANY HAVE ADOPTED NIETZSCHE'S MANNERISMS AND WORD-COINAGES WHO HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH HIM BEYOND THE IDEAS AND BUSINESS THEY PLAGIARISED
HOW HAVE I STILL--INCLINATION
TIGERS AND PALMS AND RATTLE-SNAKES
THERE HATH EVERYTHING BECOME SMALLER
AND ALAS
AND ALAS
EVERYTHING CACKLETH BUT WHO WILL STILL SIT QUIETLY ON THE NEST AND HATCH EGGS
IT MUST LIKE A SAND-GLASS EVER TURN UP ANEW THAT IT MAY ANEW RUN DOWN AND RUN OUT SO THAT ALL THOSE YEARS ARE LIKE ONE ANOTHER IN THE GREATEST AND ALSO IN THE SMALLEST SO THAT WE OURSELVES IN EVERY GREAT YEAR ARE LIKE OURSELVES IN THE GREATEST AND ALSO IN THE SMALLEST
BUT NEVER DO I BELIEVE HER AND HER LAUGHTER WHEN SHE SPEAKETH EVIL OF HERSELF
NOW THERE DANCETH A GOD IN ME THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
O ZARATHUSTRA I AM WEARY OF IT I AM DISGUSTED WITH MINE ARTS I AM NOT GREAT WHY DO I DISSEMBLE
THERE IS ALSO GOOD TASTE IN PIETY
IT TURNED AWAY ALL AT ONCE FROM ZARATHUSTRA AND ROARING WILDLY SPRANG TOWARDS THE CAVE
WHO SHOULD NOT ASCEND HIGH MOUNTAINS TO BEHOLD SUCH GROWTHS
AND ESPECIALLY ABOVE THE HEAVENS
LO THOU SITTEST IN THY PITCH!"--"WHAT DO YE SAY MINE ANIMALS SAID ZARATHUSTRA LAUGHING
XI
XI
IS THIS TRUE
THERE IS THERE MUCH RIGHT MUCH WRONG
MANY HONOURS I WANT NOT NOR GREAT TREASURES
AND HIS EYE DIRECTED ITSELF INWARDLY AS IF IT GAZED INTO THE FAR DISTANCE
THUS DO I CALL YOUR WILL
FOR THUS SPEAKETH JUSTICE UNTO ME
FOR THUS SPEAKETH JUSTICE UNTO ME
SPEAK THOU NONDESCRIPT O ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED THE UGLIEST MAN THOU ART A ROGUE
BUT EVEN AMONG KNAVES HONOUR SAITH THAT ONE SHALL ONLY STEAL WHEN ONE CANNOT ROB IT GIVETH ITSELF"--THAT IS ALSO A DOCTRINE OF SUBMISSION
BAREFOOTED UP TO THE NECK
IF THEY HAD--BREAD FOR NOTHING ALAS
LEAVE ME ALONE
LEAVE ME ALONE
THEN DID A ROARING WIND TEAR THE FOLDS APART
OR WAS IT A SERMON OF DEATH THAT CALLED HOLY WHAT CONTRADICTED AND DISSUADED FROM LIFE?--O MY BRETHREN BREAK UP BREAK UP FOR ME THE OLD TABLES
WITH MY TEARS GO INTO THINE ISOLATION MY BROTHER
EITHER I--OR THOU
OR YE WILL LEARN THAT A SAGE IS ALSO A FOOL
WHAT WILT THOU HIGHWAY-AMBUSHER FROM--ME
TO MINE OWN SECRETEST CONCEPTIONS IN-CLAMBER
SUCH SLEEP IS CONTAGIOUS--EVEN THROUGH A THICK WALL IT IS CONTAGIOUS
HE HOWEVER WHO COMETH NIGH TO HIS GOAL DANCETH
LET US SEE TO IT THAT WE MAKE OUR AFTERNOON OUR OWN SEE NOTE XLIX PART III CHAPTER LXXI
BUT EVEN BEFORE AND SHORTLY AFTER IT HAD BEEN PRIVATELY PRINTED HE WROTE TO ME SAYING THAT HE STILL INTENDED WRITING A FIFTH AND SIXTH PART AND NOTES RELATING TO THESE PARTS ARE NOW IN MY POSSESSION
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE VALUE OF HEALTHY INNOCENT VOLUPTUOUSNESS LIKE THE VALUE OF HEALTH ITSELF MUST HAVE BEEN GREATLY DISCOUNTED BY ALL THOSE WHO RESENTING THEIR INABILITY TO PARTAKE OF THIS WORLD'S GOODS CRIED LIKE ST PAUL
NOT FOR ALL BUT FOR THEE AND ME AND WHOEVER HATH HIS CONSCIENCE IN HIS HEAD
THE CHANGE IS ONE OF SUCH FAR-REACHING IMPORTANCE THAT WE CANNOT DISPOSE OF IT IN A BREATH AS A MERE PLAY UPON WORDS
THERE IS AN ISLE IN THE SEA--NOT FAR FROM THE HAPPY ISLES OF ZARATHUSTRA--ON WHICH A VOLCANO EVER SMOKETH
FOR HE FEARED THAT SOME ONE HAD HERE MET WITH HARM WHICH THE PITY OF THE KINE WOULD HARDLY BE ABLE TO RELIEVE

SOME INSPIRING TEXT
SPARE ME FOR ONE GREAT VICTORY THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
YOUR CRUTCH HOWEVER I AM NOT THESE TWO PARAGRAPHS ARE AN EXHORTATION TO HIGHER MEN TO BECOME INDEPENDENT
THEN PERHAPS WOULD HE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE AND LOVE THE EARTH--AND LAUGHTER ALSO
LITTLE DO THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GREAT--THAT IS TO SAY THE CREATING AGENCY
HE HAD NO REST AND LOST HIS SPEECH
FREEDOM YE ALL ROAR MOST EAGERLY
BUT I LIVE IN MINE OWN LIGHT I DRINK AGAIN INTO MYSELF THE FLAMES THAT BREAK FORTH FROM ME
FIRST PART
FIRST PART
WEARINESS WHICH SEEKETH TO GET TO THE ULTIMATE WITH ONE LEAP WITH A DEATH-LEAP
AND VERILY O MY SOUL
HE HOWEVER CALLETH IT HIS PITY THE LITTLE MAN ESPECIALLY THE POET--HOW PASSIONATELY DOTH HE ACCUSE LIFE IN WORDS
YOUR WILL AND YOUR VALUATIONS HAVE YE PUT ON THE RIVER OF BECOMING
WHAT ARE POOR AND RICH AT PRESENT
HAD I DREAMT
I WOULD THAT THEY HAD A MADNESS BY WHICH THEY SUCCUMBED LIKE THIS PALE CRIMINAL
AS YET HATH THE HOUR OF MY FINAL STRUGGLE NOT COME TO ME--OR DOTH IT COME TO ME PERHAPS JUST NOW
AFTER A WHILE CONSCIOUSNESS RETURNED TO THE SHATTERED MAN AND HE SAW ZARATHUSTRA KNEELING BESIDE HIM
MY HAPPINESS ITSELF DO I THROW OUT INTO ALL PLACES FAR AND WIDE TWIXT ORIENT NOONTIDE AND OCCIDENT TO SEE IF MANY HUMAN FISH WILL NOT LEARN TO HUG AND TUG AT MY HAPPINESS UNTIL BITING AT MY SHARP HIDDEN HOOKS THEY HAVE TO COME UP UNTO MY HEIGHT THE MOTLEYEST ABYSS-GROUNDLINGS TO THE WICKEDEST OF ALL FISHERS OF MEN
THE OVERCOMING OF MORALITY THROUGH ITSELF--THROUGH TRUTHFULNESS THE OVERCOMING OF THE MORALIST THROUGH HIS OPPOSITE--THROUGH ME
THE MARKET-PLACE AND THE PEOPLE WERE LIKE THE SEA WHEN THE STORM COMETH ON
TO CONCEAL MYSELF AND MY RICHES--THAT DID I LEARN DOWN THERE
I STRIVE AFTER MY WORK
I STRIVE AFTER MY WORK
THEY THINK COUGHING AN OBJECTION TO STRONG WINDS--THEY DIVINE NOTHING OF THE BOISTEROUSNESS OF MY HAPPINESS
MY CONTEMPT AND MY LONGING INCREASE TOGETHER
OF TRUTH THE WOOER
SOME OF THEM ARE GENUINE BUT MOST OF THEM ARE BAD ACTORS
PRECISELY FROM HIM DID THEY FISH HIS BEST-CONCEALED FISH
OR DOTH IT SIT BEHIND A BIG STONE AND CATCH FLIES
OR THEY LEARN TO SHUDDER WITH A LEARNED SEMI-MADCAP WHO WAITETH IN DARKENED ROOMS FOR SPIRITS TO COME TO HIM--AND THE SPIRIT RUNNETH AWAY ENTIRELY
WHAT HATH HE TO DO WITH HERDS AND HERDSMEN AND CORPSES
SEVEN
ON THAT ACCOUNT WANT I THE HONEST ONES TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER
IT IS THIRSTIER HEARTIER HUNGRIER MORE FRIGHTFUL MORE MYSTERIOUS THAN ALL WOE
FOR THUS SEEKETH HE HIS OWN DOWN-GOING
CHANGEABLE IS SHE AND WAYWARD
THUS THERE AROSE SOME UNEASINESS
BUT HE--HAD TO DIE
THAT YE MIGHT BECOME WEARY OF THE WORDS REWARD RETRIBUTION PUNISHMENT RIGHTEOUS VENGEANCE THAT YE MIGHT BECOME WEARY OF SAYING
WHOM HATETH WOMAN MOST?--THUS SPAKE THE IRON TO THE LOADSTONE
BUT REMAIN QUIET THOU DISSEMBLING DOG
OR FOR DAINTY-EATERS WHO PERHAPS LET OTHERS EAT WITH THEM AND ZARATHUSTRA STOOD STILL AND MEDITATED
WHY SPEAKEST THOU--OF TRUTH
SCHOLARS
SCHOLARS
SCHOLARS
WHAT HATH BEEN RESERVED FOR ME AS MY LAST SIN AND ONCE MORE ZARATHUSTRA BECAME ABSORBED IN HIMSELF AND SAT DOWN AGAIN ON THE BIG STONE AND MEDITATED
THE EARTH HATH THEN BECOME SMALL AND ON IT THERE HOPPETH THE LAST MAN WHO MAKETH EVERYTHING SMALL
WHO TAUGHT THAT TO THEE
I SLEPT MY SLEEP FROM DEEPEST DREAM I'VE WOKE AND PLEAD THE WORLD IS DEEP AND DEEPER THAN THE DAY COULD READ
THEREFORE AM I GLAD EVEN IN MY WINTER-BED
IF EVER I HAVE SAT REJOICING WHERE OLD GODS LIE BURIED WORLD-BLESSING WORLD-LOVING BESIDE THE MONUMENTS OF OLD WORLD-MALIGNERS FOR EVEN CHURCHES AND GODS'-GRAVES DO I LOVE IF ONLY HEAVEN LOOKETH THROUGH THEIR RUINED ROOFS WITH PURE EYES
EXCEPT ONLY THAT THE OLD SOOTHSAYER MADE SIGNS WITH HIS HANDS AND HIS GESTURES
I WALKED IN THE BROADEST AND NARROWEST PATHS TO LEARN ITS NATURE
THUS DID THE WILL THE EMANCIPATOR BECOME A TORTURER
NOW WILL CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER EVER FROM COFFINS FLOW
OVER THE LOITERING AND TARDY WILL I LEAP
AN INSTRUMENT OF THY BODY IS ALSO THY LITTLE SAGACITY MY BROTHER WHICH THOU CALLEST SPIRIT SAYS ZARATHUSTRA
SPIDER WHY SPINNEST THOU AROUND ME
BREAK UP BREAK UP YE DISCERNING ONES THE OLD TABLES
FOR THERE WERE MANY CURIOUS AND DANGEROUS THINGS TO BE HEARD ON BOARD THE SHIP WHICH CAME FROM AFAR AND WAS TO GO STILL FURTHER
AND IF I PLEASE THEE NOT--WELL O ZARATHUSTRA
AND THEREFORE STROVE I LONG AND WAS A STRIVER THAT I MIGHT ONE DAY GET MY HANDS FREE FOR BLESSING
ONLY AS IMAGE OF THE HIGHEST VIRTUE CAME GOLD TO THE HIGHEST VALUE
AND AS LIFE AND YOUTH SITTEST THOU HERE HOPEFUL ON THE YELLOW RUINS OF GRAVES
OH
OH
THE SPIRIT OF REVENGE
AT THY TREE O ZARATHUSTRA THE GLOOMY AND ILL-CONSTITUTED ALSO REFRESH THEMSELVES
AT YOU YE VIRTUOUS ONES LAUGHED MY BEAUTY TO-DAY
AND WHAT HIDEST THOU SO CAREFULLY UNDER THY MANTLE
MILK-BOSOMS
FOR WHAT DISTINGUISHES THAT PHILOSOPHER FROM ALL OTHERS IN THE PAST IS THE VERY FACT THAT HE WAS EXACTLY THE REVERSE OF AN IMMORALIST
SO THAT I HAVE TO-DAY ASCENDED THIS HIGH MOUNTAIN TO CATCH FISH
BUT EVEN THE SUPERFLUOUS ONES MAKE MUCH ADO ABOUT THEIR DEATH AND EVEN THE HOLLOWEST NUT WANTETH TO BE CRACKED
WHO CREATED FOR THEMSELVES SUCH CAVES AND PENITENCE-STAIRS
IN THE NIGHT HOWEVER HE WENT AWAY ALONE AND LEFT HIS FRIENDS
XLIV
XLIV
IT IS A SMALL THING FOR THE SPIRIT TO REMOVE MOUNTAINS,--DID YE KNOW THAT BEFORE
FOR VERILY THERE IS ALSO WISDOM THAT BLOOMETH IN THE DARK A NIGHT-SHADE WISDOM WHICH EVER SIGHETH
DANGEROUS IS IT TO BE AN HEIR
A FOLLY WOULD IT BE
GOLD SAW I GLEAM IN THY NIGHT-EYES,--MY HEART STOOD STILL WITH DELIGHT
FOR HE FELT FROZEN TO THE VERY BOWELS
IN WICKEDNESS THE HAUGHTY MAN AND THE WEAKLING MEET
AND HOW NICELY CAN DOGGISH LUST BEG FOR A PIECE OF SPIRIT WHEN A PIECE OF FLESH IS DENIED IT
I LOVE HIM WHO JUSTIFIETH THE FUTURE ONES AND REDEEMETH THE PAST ONES
VERILY HE IS NOT INDIGNANT AT THEIR MODES OF CONSOLATION AND INGRATITUDE
AND THIS SECRET SPAKE LIFE HERSELF UNTO ME
AND THAT LONG LANE FORWARD--THAT IS ANOTHER ETERNITY
IT MOVETH MY HEART FOR THOSE PRIESTS
NIETZSCHE AT LENGTH REALISED THAT THE FRIEND OF HIS FANCY AND THE REAL RICHARD WAGNER--THE COMPOSER OF PARSIFAL--WERE NOT ONE
YE LONG IT ALMOST SEEMETH SO TO ME--FORGIVE MY PRESUMPTION YE HIGHER MEN YE LONG FOR THE WORST AND DANGEROUSEST LIFE WHICH FRIGHTENETH ME MOST,--FOR THE LIFE OF WILD BEASTS FOR FORESTS CAVES STEEP MOUNTAINS AND LABYRINTHINE GORGES
ZARATHUSTRA CALLS HIMSELF THE ADVOCATE OF THE CIRCLE THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS AND HE CALLS THIS DOCTRINE HIS ABYSMAL THOUGHT
AND IT IS THE GREAT NOONTIDE WHEN MAN IS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS COURSE BETWEEN ANIMAL AND SUPERMAN AND CELEBRATETH HIS ADVANCE TO THE EVENING AS HIS HIGHEST HOPE
HERE HOWEVER ART THOU AT HOME AND HOUSE WITH THYSELF
STRANGERS HOWEVER AND THE POOR MAY PLUCK FOR THEMSELVES THE FRUIT FROM MY TREE
NEITHER DOTH WATER SUIT WEARY AND WITHERED ONES
IT CONCEALETH NOT ITS CHILBLAINS EITHER
AND BEING JUDGE SEEMETH TO THEM BLISS
THOU DOEST VIOLENCE TO THYSELF THOU PREACHER-ON-THE-MOUNT WHEN THOU USEST SUCH SEVERE WORDS
THEN HAST THOU ITS NAME IN COMMON WITH THE PEOPLE AND HAST BECOME ONE OF THE PEOPLE AND THE HERD WITH THY VIRTUE
NOTHING LIVETH ANY LONGER THAT I LOVE,--HOW SHOULD I STILL LOVE MYSELF
NOTHING LIVETH ANY LONGER THAT I LOVE,--HOW SHOULD I STILL LOVE MYSELF
HERE CANST THOU UTTER EVERYTHING AND UNBOSOM ALL MOTIVES
BUT ONE TIME HE SPOILT HIS COMPANY FOR ALL TIME
WISE FOOLS SPEAK BETTER
LIKE THOSE WHO STAND IN THE STREET AND GAPE AT THE PASSERS-BY
THEREFORE DEPART INTO THE FORESTS AND LAY YOUR SWORD TO SLEEP
FOR ABOVE ALL THEY WANT TO BE TREATED INDULGENTLY
AND WHEN ONCE LIFE ASKED ME
THUS WILL WE HAVE A GOOD REPAST IN A LITTLE WHILE
BE IT FORGOTTEN AND DEAD STILL ITS RAY OF LIGHT LIVETH AND TRAVELLETH
BUT THAT YE MAY UNDERSTAND MY GOSPEL OF GOOD AND EVIL FOR THAT PURPOSE WILL I TELL YOU MY GOSPEL OF LIFE AND OF THE NATURE OF ALL LIVING THINGS
VERILY YE DECEIVE YE CONTEMPLATIVE ONES EVEN ZARATHUSTRA WAS ONCE THE DUPE OF YOUR GODLIKE EXTERIOR
ETERNALLY ROLLETH THE WHEEL OF EXISTENCE
THERE ARE TOO MANY DEPTHS FOR ALL ANCHORITES
GOBINEAU IN HIS GREAT WORK L'INEGALITE DES RACES HUMAINES LAYS STRONG EMPHASIS UPON THE EVILS WHICH ARISE FROM PROMISCUOUS AND INTER-SOCIAL MARRIAGES
FOR A SUDDEN IRRITATION CAME OVER HIM ON ACCOUNT OF THE CROWD AND THE CROWDING IN HIS MOUNTAINS
BECOME WHAT THOU ART SURELY THE CRITICISM WHICH HAS BEEN DIRECTED AGAINST THIS MAXIM MUST ALL FALL TO THE GROUND WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT NIETZSCHE'S TEACHING WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE OTHER THAN AN ESOTERIC ONE
O ZARATHUSTRA I SEEK A GENUINE ONE A RIGHT ONE A SIMPLE ONE AN UNEQUIVOCAL ONE A MAN OF PERFECT HONESTY A VESSEL OF WISDOM A SAINT OF KNOWLEDGE A GREAT MAN
NOT EVERYTHING MAY BE UTTERED IN PRESENCE OF DAY
OUT OF THEIR COUNTENANCES PEER THE HANGMAN AND THE SLEUTH-HOUND
THIS MAN GRIEVED HIM EXCEEDINGLY
O MY NEW FRIENDS SAID HE YE STRANGE ONES YE HIGHER MEN HOW WELL DO YE NOW PLEASE ME SINCE YE HAVE AGAIN BECOME JOYFUL
TO BECOME ENDURABLE TO ONESELF AN INNER TRANSFORMATION IS NECESSARY
THE SNAKE THAT CHOKES HIM REPRESENTS THE STULTIFYING AND PARALYSING SOCIAL VALUES THAT THREATEN TO SHATTER HUMANITY AND THE ADVICE BITE
THUS I FOUND IT
AND THOU MY FIRST COMPANION REST IN PEACE
AND I MYSELF ALMOST A CORPSE
DO I NOT ALREADY STAND HERE WET WITH THY MISERY AND DRENCHED LIKE A DOG
EVERYTHING DIETH EVERYTHING BLOSSOMETH FORTH AGAIN
HIS OWN PARTICULAR KIND OF ALTRUISM--THE ALTRUISM THAT MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED THE EXISTENCE OF THIS MAN--STRIKES HIM WITH ALL ITS FORCE
HOW DIVINELY DO VAULT AND ARCH HERE CONTRAST IN THE STRUGGLE
THESE ARE ALWAYS THE GREAT MAJORITY THE COMMON-PLACE THE SUPERFLUOUS THE FAR-TOO MANY--THOSE ALL ARE COWARDLY HIM WHO IS OF MY TYPE WILL ALSO THE EXPERIENCES OF MY TYPE MEET ON THE WAY
EVEN MOULD ENNOBLETH CHILDREN MIGHT THUS SPEAK
TOO LONG HAVE WE ACKNOWLEDGED THEM TO BE RIGHT THOSE PETTY PEOPLE
AND JUST ON THAT ACCOUNT DID THEY PAY YOU REVERENCE
THE SOUND ONES MAY TALK
O ZARATHUSTRA"--SAID THE CHILD UNTO ME--"LOOK AT THYSELF IN THE MIRROR BUT WHEN I LOOKED INTO THE MIRROR I SHRIEKED AND MY HEART THROBBED
HOW HAD IT THE PATIENCE AND LEISURE TO-DAY FOR WORLD-WEIGHING
HEARKEN NOW UNTO MY WORD YE WISEST ONES
FOR IT IS PRECISELY VIEWS OF THIS SORT WHICH AFTER HAVING BEEN CUT OUT OF THE ORIGINAL CONTEXT ARE REPEATED FAR AND WIDE AS INTERNAL EVIDENCE PROVING THE GENERAL UNSOUNDNESS OF NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY
BEYOND YOURSELVES SHALL YE LOVE SOME DAY
THOU GOEST TO WOMEN
BUT ALL THAT IS ONE AND THE SAME SECRET
THE LIVING THING DID I FOLLOW
TO HEART IN-CLAMBER
SICK ARE THEY ALWAYS
FREE FOR WHAT AND IN THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE
HE WAS ALSO INDISTINCT
LIKE THE SUN WHICH PERSUADETH EVEN THE SEA TO ITS HEIGHT
HERE DO ALL THINGS COME CARESSINGLY TO THY TALK AND FLATTER THEE
WHAT THOU DOEST CAN NO ONE DO TO THEE AGAIN
AH FRIENDS DO YE DIVINE ALSO MY HEART'S DOUBLE WILL
SAWEST THOU EVER THY FRIEND ASLEEP--TO KNOW HOW HE LOOKETH
MAN IS SOMETHING THAT HATH TO BE SURPASSED LXVIII
HOW MANY THINGS ARE STILL POSSIBLE
BLOOD THEY WOULD HAVE FROM THEE IN ALL INNOCENCE
YEA IT FINDETH YOU OUT TOO YE CONQUERORS OF THE OLD GOD
FOOT AND EYE SHALL NOT LIE NOR GIVE THE LIE TO EACH OTHER
I AM NOT POOR ENOUGH FOR THAT THE SAINT LAUGHED AT ZARATHUSTRA AND SPAKE THUS
THAT IS JUST DIVINITY THAT THERE ARE GODS BUT NO GOD 12
IT SAITH
INSTRUMENTS AND PLAYTHINGS ARE SENSE AND SPIRIT
FOR THE SOUL WHICH HATH THE LONGEST LADDER AND CAN GO DEEPEST DOWN
AND IT BECAME A CURSE UNTO ALL HUMANITY THAT THIS FOLLY ACQUIRED SPIRIT
THOU EVIL FLATTERER CRIED ZARATHUSTRA MISCHIEVOUSLY WHY DOST THOU SPOIL ME WITH SUCH PRAISE AND FLATTERY-HONEY
CANST THOU GIVE UNTO THYSELF THY BAD AND THY GOOD AND SET UP THY WILL AS A LAW OVER THEE
TO PLEASE SUCH MAIDENS I THEN COMPOSED AN AFTER-DINNER PSALM THUS SPAKE THE WANDERER WHO CALLED HIMSELF ZARATHUSTRA'S SHADOW
TO MEN I AM STILL SOMETHING BETWEEN A FOOL AND A CORPSE
THEY MEET AN INVALID OR AN OLD MAN OR A CORPSE--AND IMMEDIATELY THEY SAY
FOR THEY HAD FOUND WHEN THEY AWAKENED THAT HE NO LONGER TARRIED WITH THEM
DEEP IS ITS WOE
HOW LEAN YOUR RIBS
O ZARATHUSTRA HOW WELL IT WAS THAT WE SET OUT TO SEE THEE
THEY HAVE LEFT THE REGIONS WHERE IT IS HARD TO LIVE
WHAT WOULD IT BE IF HE DEMANDED CHASTITY OF HIMSELF
AND MANY A ONE WHO CANNOT SEE MEN'S LOFTINESS CALLETH IT VIRTUE TO SEE THEIR BASENESS FAR TOO WELL
BUT AS THOU AWOKEST FROM THEM AND CAMEST TO THYSELF SO SHALL THEY AWAKEN FROM THEMSELVES--AND COME UNTO THEE THUS SPAKE THE DISCIPLE
IT IS LAUDABLE WHAT THEY THINK HARD
ONE THING IS FORSAKENNESS ANOTHER MATTER IS LONESOMENESS
SO HIGH HATH IT GROWN
THAT IS THE NAME OF MY TERRIBLE MISTRESS
BLESS THE CUP THAT IS ABOUT TO OVERFLOW THAT THE WATER MAY FLOW GOLDEN OUT OF IT AND CARRY EVERYWHERE THE REFLECTION OF THY BLISS
HOW MUCH CONTEMPT IS OPPOSED TO IT
NO ONE HAVE I YET FOUND WHO MORE THOROUGHLY DESPISED HIMSELF
WHO ART THOU ASKED ZARATHUSTRA VEHEMENTLY WHAT DOEST THOU HERE
WHAT WONDER THAT MANY A VESSEL SHATTERETH
I PARTICULAR QUOTATIONS ARE OFTEN NOT CLOSED FOR SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS
THE READER WHO PERCHANCE MAY KNOW NO MORE CONCERNING NIETZSCHE THAN A MAGAZINE ARTICLE HAS TOLD HIM TRIES TO READ IT AND UNDERSTANDING LESS THAN HALF HE READS PROBABLY NEVER GETS FURTHER THAN THE SECOND OR THIRD PART,--AND THEN ONLY TO FEEL CONVINCED THAT NIETZSCHE HIMSELF WAS RATHER HAZY AS TO WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
HUSH AND HERE ZARATHUSTRA STRETCHED HIMSELF AND FELT THAT HE WAS ASLEEP UP SAID HE TO HIMSELF THOU SLEEPER
FIRST PRINCIPLE OF OUR CHARITY
OR THEY LEARN IN GODLY-GAY STYLE TO PLAY THE HARP WITH A HYMN-POET WHO WOULD FAIN HARP HIMSELF INTO THE HEART OF YOUNG GIRLS:--FOR HE HATH TIRED OF OLD GIRLS AND THEIR PRAISES
THEN DID WE SAY AT LAST
AND BLOOD IS COUNTED BY HIM AS THE BEST OF ALL ARGUMENTS
AND AT LEAST EVERY ONE CLAIMETH TO BE AN AUTHORITY ON GOOD AND EVIL BUT ZARATHUSTRA CAME NOT TO SAY UNTO ALL THOSE LIARS AND FOOLS
VERILY EVER ARE WE DRAWN ALOFT--THAT IS TO THE REALM OF THE CLOUDS
AND WHAT WOULD BE MY LOVE TO THE SUPERMAN AND TO ALL THAT IS TO COME IF I SHOULD COUNSEL AND SPEAK OTHERWISE
JUST HEAR THIS GLUTTON ZARATHUSTRA SAID HE JOKINGLY
A DOCTRINE APPEARED A FAITH RAN BESIDE IT
AT THEIR WORDS WILL I NOW CHEW A LONG WHILE AS AT GOOD CORN
LET ME BE THY GUEST O ZARATHUSTRA FOR A SINGLE NIGHT
IS IT A TREASURE THAT HATH BEEN GIVEN THEE
IT IS MORE VERILY WHEN OUT OF ONE'S OWN BURNING COMETH ONE'S OWN TEACHING
THEY DESIRE TO HAVE NOTHING GRATUITOUSLY LEAST OF ALL LIFE
AH HOW OFT DID I STAND THERE NAKED ON THAT ACCOUNT LIKE A RED CRAB
SO IT WAS YOUR CRY OF DISTRESS THAT I HEARD
THIS TO-DAY HOWEVER IS THAT OF THE POPULACE
THIS ONE WENT FORTH IN QUEST OF TRUTH AS A HERO AND AT LAST GOT FOR HIMSELF A SMALL DECKED-UP LIE
WOULDST THOU GET IN
THIS MOST PRYING OVER-INTRUSIVE OVER-PITIFUL ONE HAD TO DIE
THEY FLATTER THEE AS ONE FLATTERETH A GOD OR DEVIL
I SAW THEM ALWAYS PREPARE THEIR POISON WITH PRECAUTION
A SMALL COMPANY IS MORE WELCOME TO ME THAN A BAD ONE
LET HIM QUESTION ME WHOEVER WILL
MUST ONE FIRST BATTER THEIR EARS THAT THEY MAY LEARN TO HEAR WITH THEIR EYES
AND BE CONCISE--THAT BID'TH MINE OTHER PRIDE
WHO ART THOU THEN O MY SOUL AND HERE HE BECAME FRIGHTENED FOR A SUNBEAM SHOT DOWN FROM HEAVEN UPON HIS FACE O HEAVEN ABOVE ME SAID HE SIGHING AND SAT UPRIGHT THOU GAZEST AT ME
OFF
OFF
NOWHERE ON EARTH SHALL I NOW FEEL BETTER THAN WITH THEE AMEN
WE ALL BLEED ON SECRET SACRIFICIAL ALTARS WE ALL BURN AND BROIL IN HONOUR OF ANCIENT IDOLS
FOR THITHER DOTH MINE OTHER WILL TEND
ANOTHER CENTURY OF READERS--AND SPIRIT ITSELF WILL STINK
AND BECAUSE WE KNOW LITTLE THEREFORE ARE WE PLEASED FROM THE HEART WITH THE POOR IN SPIRIT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG WOMEN
AND YET--HOW LITTLE WAS LACKING FOR THEM TO CARESS EACH OTHER THAT DOG AND THAT LONESOME ONE
SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER XLVI IN PART II
TOUCH THIS SO THAT IT MAY TREMBLE
TO BE SURE YE CALL IT WILL TO PROCREATION OR IMPULSE TOWARDS A GOAL TOWARDS THE HIGHER REMOTER MORE MANIFOLD
RECONDITE
BY THE WORD REARING IN THIS CASE IS MEANT THE ACT OF MODIFYING BY MEANS OF NEW AND HIGHER VALUES--VALUES WHICH AS LAWS AND GUIDES OF CONDUCT AND OPINION ARE NOW TO RULE OVER MANKIND
IF ONLY THE DEVIL IS NOT A BETTER THIEF THAN ZARATHUSTRA!--HE WILL STEAL THEM BOTH HE WILL EAT THEM BOTH AND THEY LAUGHED AMONG THEMSELVES AND PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER
THOU WOULDST WEAR NO RAIMENT BEFORE THY FRIEND
AND HE WHO LOVETH HIS GOD CHASTISETH HIM
THE ICE HOWEVER--BREAKETH GANGWAYS
OF MAN THERE IS LITTLE HERE
ALL MOUSE-TRAPS FOR THE HEART HAVE AGAIN BEEN SET
AND ALL HIS GUESTS ALSO WERE SILENT AND STOOD STILL AND CONFOUNDED
BEFORE THEM DID ONE BOW THE KNEE AND THE HEAD AND TAKE OFF ONE'S SHOES
FELLOW-REAPERS AND FELLOW-REJOICERS ZARATHUSTRA SEEKETH
CEASE NOT YOUR DANCING YE LOVELY MAIDENS
YE CREATING ONES IN YOU THERE IS MUCH UNCLEANLINESS
WHAT IF A CITY DID BECOME A MUMMY AND A STATUE LAY IN THE MUD
AND INSTEAD OF A SOUL I HAVE OFTEN FOUND IN THEM SALT SLIME
LXIX
LXIX
SHOULD NOT EVERYTHING--STAND STILL
THE TAME MORAL READING OF THE FACE OF NATURE TOGETHER WITH SUCH DEMOCRATIC INTERPRETATIONS OF LIFE AS THOSE SUGGESTED BY HERBERT SPENCER ARE SIGNS OF A PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION WHICH IS THE REVERSE OF THAT BOUNDING AND IRRESPONSIBLE HEALTHINESS IN WHICH HARDER AND MORE TRAGIC VALUES RULE
AT TRAGEDIES BULL-FIGHTS AND CRUCIFIXIONS HATH HE HITHERTO BEEN HAPPIEST ON EARTH
ILLUSTRIOUS IS IT TO HAVE MANY VIRTUES BUT A HARD LOT
I AM THE HUNTER,--WILT THOU BE MY HOUND OR MY CHAMOIS ANON
ETERNALLY TRUE TO ITSELF REMAINETH THE RING OF EXISTENCE
COME HITHER
LET THIS BE ENOUGH FOR ME
HE DID NOT HOWEVER MEAN THEREBY THAT HIS FORMER DISORDERS WERE TROUBLING HIM BUT THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FROM A SEVERE ATTACK OF INFLUENZA WHICH HE HAD CAUGHT IN SANTA MARGHERITA AND WHICH TORMENTED HIM FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN GENOA
IT SEEKETH HOWEVER THE RULER AN ATTEMPT MY BRETHREN
HE WHOSE HAND TREMBLES WHEN IT LAYS HOLD OF A BEAUTIFUL THING HAS THE QUALITY OF REVERENCE WITHOUT THE ARTIST'S UNEMBARRASSED FRIENDSHIP WITH THE BEAUTIFUL
TO THOSE BELIEVERS SHALL HE WHO IS OF MY TYPE AMONG MEN NOT BIND HIS HEART
THEREFORE THEIR FEELING DID NOT REACH TO THE BOTTOM
WE SEEK DIFFERENT THINGS EVEN HERE ALOFT YE AND I
AND SHOULD YE CELEBRATE IT AGAIN HE CONCLUDES DO IT FROM LOVE TO YOURSELVES DO IT ALSO FROM LOVE TO ME
IN THE FIRST MORALITY IT IS THE EAGLE WHICH LOOKING DOWN UPON A BROWSING LAMB CONTENDS THAT EATING LAMB IS GOOD IN THE SECOND THE SLAVE-MORALITY IT IS THE LAMB WHICH LOOKING UP FROM THE SWARD BLEATS DISSENTINGLY
XXXIV

AT LEAST THE BARS KEEP HIM IN A PLACE OF REST
NOW DO THE WAVES RISE AND RISE AROUND THY MOUNTAIN O ZARATHUSTRA
WHO IS GOING TO SAY
AS SUCH A WEARY SHIP IN THE CALMEST COVE SO DO I ALSO NOW REPOSE NIGH TO THE EARTH FAITHFUL TRUSTING WAITING BOUND TO IT WITH THE LIGHTEST THREADS
IF WE NOW READ WHAT THE FOOL SAYS TO ZARATHUSTRA AND NOTE THE TRICKS OF SPEECH HE HAS BORROWED FROM HIM
WHERE HAVE THERE EVER BEEN BETTER ROBBERS AND SLAYERS IN THE WORLD THAN SUCH HOLY PRECEPTS
NOW DOTH MY LONGING BREAK FORTH IN ME AS A FOUNTAIN,--FOR SPEECH DO I LONG
THERE HAVE I UNLEARNED SILENCE THAT HAST THOU LEARNED NOW--SURELY
IS IT NOT DEGENERATION?--AND WE ALWAYS SUSPECT DEGENERATION WHEN THE BESTOWING SOUL IS LACKING
AND I BADE THEM UPSET THEIR OLD ACADEMIC CHAIRS AND WHEREVER THAT OLD INFATUATION HAD SAT
BUT FIRST OF ALL MUST THOU BE BUILT THYSELF RECTANGULAR IN BODY AND SOUL
EXILES SHALL YE BE FROM ALL FATHERLANDS AND FOREFATHER-LANDS
AND PRECISELY THAT WAS TO BE VIRTUE AND WAS TO BE CALLED VIRTUE--TO ABUSE SELFISHNESS
THEY ARE THE COMPANIONS AND FORERUNNERS OF SUCH SAINTSHIP
HERE THOU ART NOT AT HOME BUT IN MY DOMAIN AND THEREIN SHALL NO ONE RECEIVE ANY HURT
NOW SITTETH HE HERE AND WAITETH OLD BROKEN TABLES AROUND HIM AND ALSO NEW TABLES--HALF-WRITTEN
HAVE YE UNDERSTOOD THIS WORD O MY BRETHREN
EMBITTERED MENDACIOUS AND SHALLOW
THUS HAVE I UNLEARNED TO KEEP SILENCE
BETHINKST THOU THEN BETHINKST THOU BURNING HEART HOW ONCE THOU THIRSTEDEST FOR HEAVEN'S KINDLY TEARDROPS AND DEW'S DOWN-DROPPINGS ALL SINGED AND WEARY THIRSTEDEST WHAT TIME ON YELLOW GRASS-PATHWAYS WICKED OCCIDENTAL SUNNY GLANCES THROUGH SOMBRE TREES ABOUT THEE SPORTED BLINDINGLY SUNNY GLOW-GLANCES GLADLY-HURTING
AND MANY A ONE CAN COMMAND HIMSELF BUT STILL SORELY LACKETH SELF-OBEDIENCE
EVER HEARKENETH THE SELF AND SEEKETH
AND LO THERE SPURTED INTO HIS FACE ALL AT ONCE A CRY OF PAIN AND TWO CURSES AND TWENTY BAD INVECTIVES SO THAT IN HIS FRIGHT HE RAISED HIS STICK AND ALSO STRUCK THE TRODDEN ONE
DEVISE ME THEN THE JUSTICE WHICH ACQUITTETH EVERY ONE EXCEPT THE JUDGE
AND THAT WHICH YESTERDAY WAS STILL TOO HARD FOR TIME ITSELF AND ITS TOOTH HANGETH TO-DAY OUTCHAMPED AND OUTCHEWED FROM THE MOUTHS OF THE MEN OF TO-DAY
AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY BECOME RIPE YELLOW AND SHRIVELLED
IT IS ALREADY TOO MUCH FOR ME EVEN TO RETAIN MINE OPINIONS
MINE ABYSS SPEAKETH MY LOWEST DEPTH HAVE I TURNED OVER INTO THE LIGHT
HERE IS THE HELL FOR ANCHORITES THOUGHTS
FOR THAT DO I WAIT THE WICKEDEST OF ALL FISH-CATCHERS
HE--DID NOT LOVE SUFFICIENTLY
AND THE OVERRICH MAY BE ON THEIR GUARD
SILENCE THEREON THOU SIGHING SORROW-SACK
ONLY ONE MUST BE RICH ENOUGH TO DO SO
AND ON THAT ACCOUNT DOTH THE NOBLE ONE ENJOIN UPON HIMSELF NOT TO ABASH
IT IS I THE UNGODLY ZARATHUSTRA WHO SAITH
BEHOLD SAID SHE I AM THAT WHICH MUST EVER SURPASS ITSELF
AS HE PUSHETH THE BEST-BELOVED BEFORE HIM--TENDER EVEN IN SEVERITY THE JEALOUS ONE SO DO I PUSH THIS BLISSFUL HOUR BEFORE ME
I HONOUR HIM THAT BAD GUEST BUT GLADLY LEAVE HIM ALONE
WHERE MINE HONESTY CEASETH THERE AM I BLIND AND WANT ALSO TO BE BLIND
YOUR BAD LOVE TO YOURSELVES MAKETH SOLITUDE A PRISON TO YOU
FOR THE FIRST TIME BROUGHT I AN EYE TO SEE YOU AND GOOD DESIRE
BUT IT REMAINS A VERY DARING CONJECTURE NOTWITHSTANDING AND EVEN IN ITS ULTIMATE EFFECT AS A DOGMA ON THE MINDS OF MEN I VENTURE TO DOUBT WHETHER NIETZSCHE EVER PROPERLY ESTIMATED ITS WORTH SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVII WHAT FOLLOWS IS CLEAR ENOUGH
AND THE WHOLE VIRTUE OF KINGS THAT HATH REMAINED UNTO THEM--IS IT NOT CALLED TO-DAY
SO HE SLIPPED OUT INTO THE OPEN AIR AND SPAKE TO HIS ANIMALS
THEN HOWEVER WHEN HE OPENED HIS EYES HE SAW SOMETHING SITTING BY THE WAYSIDE SHAPED LIKE A MAN AND HARDLY LIKE A MAN SOMETHING NONDESCRIPT
AND THAT WE DESPAIRING ONES HAVE NOW COME INTO THY CAVE AND ALREADY NO LONGER DESPAIR:--IT IS BUT A PROGNOSTIC AND A PRESAGE THAT BETTER ONES ARE ON THE WAY TO THEE FOR THEY THEMSELVES ARE ON THE WAY TO THEE THE LAST REMNANT OF GOD AMONG MEN--THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE MEN OF GREAT LONGING OF GREAT LOATHING OF GREAT SATIETY ALL WHO DO NOT WANT TO LIVE UNLESS THEY LEARN AGAIN TO HOPE--UNLESS THEY LEARN FROM THEE O ZARATHUSTRA THE GREAT HOPE THUS SPAKE THE KING ON THE RIGHT AND SEIZED THE HAND OF ZARATHUSTRA IN ORDER TO KISS IT
INTO HEAVENLY CHILDREN SHOULD HE TRANSFORM THEM
AND THEREFORE DID ONE BELIEVE EVERYTHING IS FREEDOM
THEREIN THERE IS NOTHING CONTEMPTIBLE
AND FORTHWITH IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE LAUGHER WEPT--WITH ANGER AND LONGING WEPT ZARATHUSTRA BITTERLY
IT IS NO EASY TASK TO UNDERSTAND UNFAMILIAR BLOOD
SEE THERE
AND LIKE THEM SHALL YE ALSO MY FRIENDS HAVE YOUR COMFORTING--AND NEW SPECKLED SHELLS THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
IV

DISAPPOINTMENT UPON DISAPPOINTMENT REVELATION AFTER REVELATION ULTIMATELY BROUGHT IT HOME TO HIM AND THOUGH HIS BEST INSTINCTS WERE NATURALLY OPPOSED TO IT AT FIRST THE REVULSION OF FEELING AT LAST BECAME TOO STRONG TO BE IGNORED AND NIETZSCHE WAS PLUNGED INTO THE BLACKEST DESPAIR
AND WHEN I AGAIN HEARD SUCH HOWLING THEN DID IT EXCITE MY COMMISERATION ONCE MORE
IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE COURAGE HAS PLAYED THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IN OUR DEVELOPMENT THAT HE WOULD NOT SEE IT VANISH FROM AMONG OUR VIRTUES TO-DAY
THE DESERTS GROW
THE DESERTS GROW
THE PEOPLE AND THE HERD MUST BE ANGRY WITH ME
RATHER IS IT OF ALL ARTS THE FINEST SUBTLEST LAST AND PATIENTEST IN THE LAST VERSE NIETZSCHE CHALLENGES US TO SHOW THAT OUR WAY IS THE RIGHT WAY
WHAT ART THOU DOING THERE SAID HE AT LAST I KNEW LONG AGO THAT THE DEVIL WOULD TRIP ME UP
EVER IS ITS LIGHT ON ITS WAY AND TRAVELLING--AND WHEN WILL IT CEASE TO BE ON ITS WAY
VERILY BETTER TO HAVE DONE EVILLY THAN TO HAVE THOUGHT PETTILY
FOR ME THAT IS TO SAY FOR THE INEXORABLE WHICH IS NOW SILENT IN ME BUT WILL NOT ALWAYS BE SILENT
A PLAYTHING LET WOMAN BE PURE AND FINE LIKE THE PRECIOUS STONE ILLUMINED WITH THE VIRTUES OF A WORLD NOT YET COME
FOR VIRTUE'S OUT-HOWL YE VERY DEAREST MAIDENS IS MORE THAN EVERY EUROPEAN FERVOUR EUROPEAN HOT-HUNGER
BUT YE DO NOT SEE THE ANVIL WHICH IT IS AND THE CRUELTY OF ITS HAMMER
AMONG DAUGHTERS OF THE DESERT
AMONG DAUGHTERS OF THE DESERT
AT HOUSE AND HOME WITH ME SHALL NO ONE DESPAIR
ABOVE ALL HOWEVER HE DESIGNATES ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE SUPERMAN
AND KEEP YOUR REASONS SECRET
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER STILL SAT BESIDE THE DEAD MAN ON THE GROUND ABSORBED IN THOUGHT
FAR TOO MANY LIVE AND FAR TOO LONG HANG THEY ON THEIR BRANCHES
BUT WHAT IF YOUR VENERATION SHOULD SOME DAY COLLAPSE
AH THE POVERTY OF SOUL IN THE TWAIN
THEN HOWEVER HE SCRUTINISED EACH INDIVIDUAL GUEST WITH COURTEOUS CURIOSITY READ THEIR SOULS AND WONDERED ANEW
THEY STING IN ALL INNOCENCE THEY LIE IN ALL INNOCENCE
MAN IS MAN BEFORE GOD--WE ARE ALL EQUAL BEFORE GOD!--NOW HOWEVER THIS GOD HATH DIED
NOW IS IT FORCED TO FIND ILLUSION AND ARBITRARINESS EVEN IN THE HOLIEST THINGS THAT IT MAY CAPTURE FREEDOM FROM ITS LOVE
BUT NOW LEAVE I PRAY YOU THIS NURSERY MINE OWN CAVE WHERE TO-DAY ALL CHILDISHNESS IS CARRIED ON
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT SHOWETH ITSELF NAKED
THERE IS A STRONG ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF THE SHARP DIFFERENTIATION OF CASTES AND OF RACES AND EVEN OF SEXES
HE WHO CANNOT LIE DOTH NOT KNOW WHAT TRUTH IS
AND THE LITANY SOUNDED THUS
VOLUNTARY DEATH
VOLUNTARY DEATH
VOLUNTARY DEATH
BECAUSE THERE HE MEANT TO EMBARK
WELL DO NOT THEN UPBRAID WHEN I ALSO OFFER YOU SOMETHING OF MINE
YE WORLD-WEARY ONES HOWEVER
VERILY I LEARNED WAITING ALSO AND THOROUGHLY SO,--BUT ONLY WAITING FOR MYSELF
WHATEVER IS OF THE EFFEMINATE TYPE WHATEVER ORIGINATETH FROM THE SERVILE TYPE AND ESPECIALLY THE POPULACE-MISHMASH:--THAT WISHETH NOW TO BE MASTER OF ALL HUMAN DESTINY--O DISGUST
TO STAND ABOVE EVERYTHING AS ITS OWN HEAVEN ITS ROUND ROOF ITS AZURE BELL AND ETERNAL SECURITY
ALL IS FALSE THERE ARE FEELINGS WHICH SEEK TO SLAY THE LONESOME ONE
ZARATHUSTRA HATH GROWN RIPE
EITHER TO BECOME EVIL BEASTS OR EVIL BEAST-TAMERS
WHETHER THEY HAD BECOME GREATER OR SMALLER
NOT THE HEIGHT IT IS THE DECLIVITY THAT IS TERRIBLE
LIFT UP YOUR HEARTS YE GOOD DANCERS HIGH
WHITHER HATH TIME GONE
VERILY I UNDERSTAND WEATHER-SIGNS
VERILY WITH INSIDIOUS BEAUTY DO SEA AND LIFE GAZE UPON ME ROUND ABOUT
I HAD TO RETURN AGAIN TO ROME
SO DID I ONCE ASK
THEN SPAKE HE THUS TO HIS DISCIPLES
WHERE I WANT TO KNOW HOWEVER THERE WANT I ALSO TO BE HONEST--NAMELY SEVERE RIGOROUS RESTRICTED CRUEL AND INEXORABLE
WHEN POWER BECOMETH GRACIOUS AND DESCENDETH INTO THE VISIBLE--I CALL SUCH CONDESCENSION BEAUTY
THE HIGHER I CLAMBER THE MORE DO I DESPISE HIM WHO CLAMBERETH
BUT I HEAR ONLY SLOW DEATH PREACHED AND PATIENCE WITH ALL THAT IS EARTHLY AH
OF A PANTHER AND EAGLE--BLESSEDNESS
AND WHEN YE HAVE MISLED HIM TO THINK WELL OF YOU YE ALSO THINK WELL OF YOURSELVES
AND MUCH HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED WITH ONE ANOTHER
YE HAVE SURELY HEARD SOMETHING OF THE WANDERER AND HIS SHADOW
BUT THE HOUR PRESSETH THEM
THE HOUR HATH COME FOR ME TO SEEK MY LOST ONES WITH THESE WORDS ZARATHUSTRA STARTED UP NOT HOWEVER LIKE A PERSON IN ANGUISH SEEKING RELIEF BUT RATHER LIKE A SEER AND A SINGER WHOM THE SPIRIT INSPIRETH
USEFUL AT THE SAME TIME AND PLEASANT
NOT FOR THEM DO I WAIT HERE IN MY MOUNTAINS
A GOLDEN SUN WITH THE SERPENT OF KNOWLEDGE AROUND IT
NO I DO NOT LIKE THEM THOSE ANIMALS TANGLED IN THE HEAVENLY TOILS
FUNDAMENTALLY STANDETH EVERYTHING STILL
THE PHILOSOPHER HOWEVER AS NIETZSCHE UNDERSTOOD HIM IS A MAN WHO CREATES NEW VALUES AND THUS LEADS MANKIND IN A NEW DIRECTION
THE SERPENT HOWEVER AND THE EAGLE WHEN THEY FOUND HIM SILENT IN SUCH WISE RESPECTED THE GREAT STILLNESS AROUND HIM AND PRUDENTLY RETIRED
DO I HEAR RIGHTLY
BUT TO CREATE ITSELF FREEDOM FOR NEW CREATING--THAT CAN THE MIGHT OF THE LION DO
GIVE HEED MY BRETHREN TO EVERY HOUR WHEN YOUR SPIRIT WOULD SPEAK IN SIMILES
DO I NOT FALL
AH FATE AND SEA
ZARATHUSTRA WAS THE FIRST TO SEE IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL THE ESSENTIAL WHEEL IN THE WORKING OF THINGS
THEY APPEAR IN THE BIOGRAPHY BY HIS SISTER AND ALTHOUGH THEIR WISDOM IS UNQUESTIONABLE THE NATURE OF THE REFORMS HE SUGGESTS RENDER IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO BECOME POPULAR JUST NOW
WELL MY FRIEND
BUT TELL ME MY BRETHREN WHAT THE CHILD CAN DO WHICH EVEN THE LION COULD NOT DO
AND OVER!--ALAS
3 AND 4
AND AGAIN CAME THE CRIES AND LAUGHTER OF THE HIGHER MEN OUT OF THE CAVE
HOW COULD IT BECOME TURBID THEREBY
YE FREE SPIRITS WHITHER HATH YOUR FREEDOM GONE
THERE ABOVE ARE SHEEP AND SUN-SET STRIPES
AND ALL BROOKS WOULD LIKE TO RUN AFTER THEE
UNFAIR TO THE SHINING ONE IN ITS INNERMOST HEART COLD TO THE SUNS:--THUS TRAVELLETH EVERY SUN
ALL THE VALUES OF THINGS--GLITTER ON ME
O YOUTH
BUT IN MAN THERE IS MORE OF THE CHILD THAN IN THE YOUTH AND LESS OF MELANCHOLY
OPEN NOW YOUR EARS UNTO ME FOR NOW WILL I SAY UNTO YOU MY WORD CONCERNING THE DEATH OF PEOPLES
FOR SUCH PILLARS OF FIRE MUST PRECEDE THE GREAT NOONTIDE
LET THE WORLD BE AS IT IS
I HAVE COME THAT I MAY SEDUCE THEE TO THY LAST SIN SAYS THE SOOTHSAYER TO ZARATHUSTRA
FORGET NOT THIS NIGHT AND THIS ASS-FESTIVAL YE HIGHER MEN
WHAT GOOD THINGS SAID HE HATH THIS DAY GIVEN ME AS AMENDS FOR ITS BAD BEGINNING
SO MUCH IS TRUE
IN SOLITUDE THERE GROWETH WHAT ANY ONE BRINGETH INTO IT--ALSO THE BRUTE IN ONE'S NATURE
WHAT WARRIOR WISHETH TO BE SPARED
AND MUCH POISON AT LAST FOR A PLEASANT DEATH
THOU TEACHEST THAT THERE IS A GREAT YEAR OF BECOMING A PRODIGY OF A GREAT YEAR
NO LONGER WILL MY SPIRIT WALK ON WORN-OUT SOLES
NO ONE KNOWETH ANY LONGER HOW TO REVERENCE
AS HERETIC OR SORCERER HE SUFFERED AND SOUGHT TO CAUSE SUFFERING
FOR LITTLE WORTH IS ALL THAT HATH ITS PRICE
HEARKEN YE JUDGES
THERE IS NO SMITH IN THE WORLD THAT COULD HAMMER YOU RIGHT AND STRAIGHT FOR ME
TO CREATE NEW VALUES--THAT EVEN THE LION CANNOT YET ACCOMPLISH
NOT YET HAVE PEOPLE LEARNED TO INAUGURATE THE FINEST FESTIVALS
ONLY TO THE WITHERED A SWEET POISON
TOO LONG HAVE I LONGED AND LOOKED INTO THE DISTANCE
NONE OF YOU SUFFERETH FROM WHAT I HAVE SUFFERED 7
BETTER VERILY TO LIVE AMONG ANCHORITES AND GOAT-HERDS THAN WITH OUR GILDED FALSE OVER-ROUGED POPULACE--THOUGH IT CALL ITSELF GOOD SOCIETY THOUGH IT CALL ITSELF NOBILITY BUT THERE ALL IS FALSE AND FOUL ABOVE ALL THE BLOOD--THANKS TO OLD EVIL DISEASES AND WORSE CURERS
I HAVE ENGAGED A PLACE HERE FOR THREE MONTHS
I KNOW NOT THE HAPPINESS OF THE RECEIVER
ONLY SINCE HE LAY IN THE GRAVE HAVE YE AGAIN ARISEN
NIETZSCHE HIMSELF DECLARES THIS TO BE THE MOST DECISIVE PORTION OF THE WHOLE OF THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA IT IS A SORT OF EPITOME OF HIS LEADING DOCTRINES
I HATE THEE MOST BECAUSE THOU ATTRACTEST BUT ART TOO WEAK TO DRAW UNTO THEE THE HAPPINESS OF MAN IS I WILL THE HAPPINESS OF WOMAN IS HE WILL LO
AND VERILY THERE WAS MUCH HERO-SPIRIT IN THEIR WORSHIP
HEARKEN TO HIM BUT DO NOT FAIL TO HEAR THE DELIGHT WHICH IS IN ALL ACCUSATION
AND THIS COUNSEL COUNSELLETH HE TO HIS ENEMIES AND TO WHATEVER SPITTETH AND SPEWETH
ONE PERSUADETH THEIR BOWELS OTHERWISE
IF EVER I HAVE PLAYED DICE WITH THE GODS AT THE DIVINE TABLE OF THE EARTH SO THAT THE EARTH QUAKED AND RUPTURED AND SNORTED FORTH FIRE-STREAMS FOR A DIVINE TABLE IS THE EARTH AND TREMBLING WITH NEW CREATIVE DICTUMS AND DICE-CASTS OF THE GODS
THOU MUST EVER BE EQUIVOCAL TRIVOCAL QUADRIVOCAL AND QUINQUIVOCAL
SORE-FRIGHTENING
THIS HOWEVER IS THE OTHER DANGER AND MINE OTHER SYMPATHY:--HE WHO IS OF THE POPULACE HIS THOUGHTS GO BACK TO HIS GRANDFATHER,--WITH HIS GRANDFATHER HOWEVER DOTH TIME CEASE
BUT THERE LAY A MAN
AND OFTEN WE ATTACK AND MAKE OURSELVES ENEMIES TO CONCEAL THAT WE ARE VULNERABLE
DEVISE ME THEN THE LOVE WHICH NOT ONLY BEARETH ALL PUNISHMENT BUT ALSO ALL GUILT
HE WHO HEARKENETH UNTO YOU HE WHO GLADLY HEARKENETH UNTO YOU IS CALLED ZARATHUSTRA
THEY TAKE FROM ME
BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL FOUND WE OUR ISLAND AND OUR GREEN MEADOW--WE TWO ALONE
NEW STARS HAST THOU MADE US SEE AND NEW NOCTURNAL GLORIES
OH HOW COULD I NOT BE ARDENT FOR ETERNITY AND FOR THE MARRIAGE-RING OF RINGS--THE RING OF THE RETURN
WHICH OF US OWETH THANKS DOTH THE GIVER NOT OWE THANKS BECAUSE THE RECEIVER RECEIVED
AND HE WHO HATH TO BE A CREATOR IN GOOD AND EVIL--VERILY HE HATH FIRST TO BE A DESTROYER AND BREAK VALUES IN PIECES
THE SUN OF EVERY PEACE SEEMED TO THEM LANGUID AND LUKEWARM THE LONG PEACE HOWEVER MADE THEM ASHAMED
OUT INTO DISTANT FUTURES WHICH NO DREAM HATH YET SEEN INTO WARMER SOUTHS THAN EVER SCULPTOR CONCEIVED,--WHERE GODS IN THEIR DANCING ARE ASHAMED OF ALL CLOTHES
AND WHAT I ONCE SAID OF THE LAST MAN WITH WHOM LIETH THE GREATEST DANGER TO THE WHOLE HUMAN FUTURE
BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK
LET YOUR SPIRIT AND YOUR VIRTUE BE DEVOTED TO THE SENSE OF THE EARTH MY BRETHREN
THE HOUR WHEN YE SAY
THE TIME IS NOW PAST WHEN ACCIDENTS COULD BEFALL ME
WELL THEN MY BRETHREN TAKE THE SUBLIME ABOUT YOU THE MANTLE OF THE UGLY
EVERY PAIN HATH TORN THY HEART FATHER-PAIN FATHERS'-PAIN FOREFATHERS'-PAIN
WHY SHOULD ONE LIVE
HE TRANSFORMS THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE"--THE PASSIVE AND INVOLUNTARY CONDITION--INTO THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER WHICH IS ACTIVE AND CREATIVE AND MUCH MORE IN HARMONY WITH DARWIN'S OWN VIEW GIVEN ABOVE CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ORGANISM ITSELF
DO NOT GET YOURSELVES CARRIED ALOFT
LET ME GO
GOOD ACTORS HAVE I FOUND ALL THE VAIN ONES
BUT GENERALLY TWO ANIMALS ALIGHT ON ONE ANOTHER
I WILL SOON MAKE WARM LEGS TO THEE THOU EVIL MAGICIAN
EVER HAST THOU BURST ALL SHACKLES OF THE TOMB
BUT HE WAS STILL IMMATURE
OFTEN HAVE I SEEN HER BITE HER LIP AND PASS THE COMB AGAINST THE GRAIN OF HER HAIR
HERE WILL I HOLD THE SCALES OVER THE WELTERING SEA
INDIGNANT BECOMETH THE FLAME WHEN THEY PUT THEIR DAMP HEARTS TO THE FIRE
THOU SHALT NOT ROB
LXXVIII
LXXVIII
AND PEACE ALSO WITH THY NEIGHBOUR'S DEVIL
THAT IS THE FIRST AND ONLY THING TO ME--AND NOT MAN
MY CAVE HOWEVER IS LARGE
OTHERWISE YOUR DYING HATH BEEN UNSATISFACTORY
ALL IS EMPTY ALL IS ALIKE ALL HATH BEEN TO BE SURE WE HAVE HARVESTED
FOR I LOVE BLOOD
THE DOG LEAPING BRISTLING WHINING--NOW DID IT SEE ME COMING--THEN DID IT HOWL AGAIN THEN DID IT CRY:--HAD I EVER HEARD A DOG CRY SO FOR HELP
AND MUST WE NOT RETURN AND RUN IN THAT OTHER LANE OUT BEFORE US THAT LONG WEIRD LANE--MUST WE NOT ETERNALLY RETURN THUS DID I SPEAK AND ALWAYS MORE SOFTLY
HIS HEART HOWEVER WAS LOOSED AND FROM HIS EYES THERE DROPPED DOWN TEARS AND FELL UPON HIS HANDS
IS TAKING NOT MORE BLESSED THAN GIVING
IT IS THE STORY OF A LIFE WHICH REACHES ITS CONSUMMATION IN ATTAINING TO A SECOND INGENUOUSNESS OR IN RETURNING TO CHILDHOOD
GOOD AND EVIL"--SO CALLETH ITSELF THIS DOWRY
AND WHEN I WANT TO MOUNT MY WILDEST HORSE THEN DOTH MY SPEAR ALWAYS HELP ME UP BEST
SO THERE FOLLOWETH THEREFROM--MARRIAGE-BREAKING
HERE MAY ONLY RATTLE-BONED SENSATIONS RATTLE
NOW IS IT ALL OVER WITH OUR CRIES OF DISTRESS
AS A TIGER DOTH HE EVER STAND ON THE POINT OF SPRINGING
BUT ZARATHUSTRA CHECKED HIS VENERATION AND STEPPED BACK FRIGHTENED FLEEING AS IT WERE SILENTLY AND SUDDENLY INTO THE FAR DISTANCE
GO YOUR WAYS
FULL OF CLATTERING BUFFOONS IS THE MARKET-PLACE,--AND THE PEOPLE GLORY IN THEIR GREAT MEN
OH JUST LOOK AT THOSE TABERNACLES WHICH THOSE PRIESTS HAVE BUILT THEMSELVES
AWAKE AND HEARKEN YE LONESOME ONES
SO LET ME TELL YOU THE TRUTH
SO LET ME TELL YOU THE TRUTH
CHAPTER LXIII
SHARP PERCEPTIONS HATH HE LIKE THE PEOPLE AND CHANGEABLE HUMOURS
OH HOW MY SOUL LAUGHED AT HIS UGLINESS
THIS--IS NOW MY WAY,--WHERE IS YOURS THUS DID I ANSWER THOSE WHO ASKED ME THE WAY FOR THE WAY--IT DOTH NOT EXIST
MY DEATH PRAISE I UNTO YOU THE VOLUNTARY DEATH WHICH COMETH UNTO ME BECAUSE I WANT IT
WITH UPRAISED BREAST AND LIKE THOSE WHO DRAW IN THEIR BREATH
BUT OUT OF THE VERY RECKONING SPEAKETH--THE WILL TO POWER THUS DID LIFE ONCE TEACH ME
WHO IS MORE GODLESS THAN I THAT I MAY ENJOY HIS TEACHING I AM ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS
WHAT DIDST THOU REPRESENT BEFORE ME THOU EVIL MAGICIAN
IN THEE THERE IS LITTLE OF THE MAGIC SPIRIT
TO ONE MAN LONESOMENESS IS THE FLIGHT OF THE SICK ONE
HERE AM I AT HOME HOW LONG HAVE I INVESTIGATED THIS ONE THING THE BRAIN OF THE LEECH SO THAT HERE THE SLIPPERY TRUTH MIGHT NO LONGER SLIP FROM ME
NIETZSCHE'S CHAPTER XXI
THESE DEAL WITH NIETZSCHE'S PRINCIPLE OF THE DESIRABILITY OF REARING A SELECT RACE
MANY THORNS ALSO HUNG ON HIM--BUT I SAW NO ROSE
ARISE NOW ARISE THOU GREAT NOONDAY
WALK IN THE FOOTSTEPS IN WHICH YOUR FATHERS VIRTUE HATH ALREADY WALKED
LIFT UP YOUR HEARTS MY BRETHREN HIGH HIGHER
LIFT UP YOUR HEARTS MY BRETHREN HIGH HIGHER
TO SPEAK TRUTH AND BE SKILFUL WITH BOW AND ARROW"--SO SEEMED IT ALIKE PLEASING AND HARD TO THE PEOPLE FROM WHOM COMETH MY NAME--THE NAME WHICH IS ALIKE PLEASING AND HARD TO ME
UPWARD
BUT AT LAST IT COMETH AND AWAKETH AND DEVOURETH AND ENGULFETH WHATEVER HATH BUILT TABERNACLES UPON IT
THAT WILL--DOTH NOT EXIST
O MY SOUL I TAUGHT THEE THE CONTEMPT WHICH DOTH NOT COME LIKE WORM-EATING THE GREAT THE LOVING CONTEMPT WHICH LOVETH MOST WHERE IT CONTEMNETH MOST
IT BREAKS THE ICE AND THE ICE BREAKS DOWN THE FOOT-BRIDGES AND RAILINGS WHEREUPON EVERYTHING IS SWEPT AWAY
OR I SHALL LET THEE SQUAT WHERE THOU SQUATTEST HALTFOOT,--AND I CARRIED THEE HIGH OBSERVE CONTINUED I THIS MOMENT
AH THAT MY HAND HATH NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH
I CALL MYSELF ZARATHUSTRA
NEW HOPES ARE IN THEIR ARMS AND LEGS THEIR HEARTS EXPAND
SING UNTO ME SING O MY SOUL
FOOLISHLY DELIVERETH ITSELF ALSO THE IMPRISONED WILL
HE WHO WOULD STRIP YOU OF VEILS AND WRAPPERS AND PAINTS AND GESTURES WOULD JUST HAVE ENOUGH LEFT TO SCARE THE CROWS
AND IF THOU HAST PUT THYSELF IN MY WAY WHAT PROOF OF ME WOULDST THOU HAVE WHEREIN DIDST THOU PUT ME TO THE TEST THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND HIS EYES SPARKLED
WILT THOU HAVE BLOOD
AND IN THE BOAT SIT THE ESTIMATES OF VALUE SOLEMN AND DISGUISED
IT IS MINE ENVY THAT I SEE WAITING EYES AND THE BRIGHTENED NIGHTS OF LONGING
THUS--LAUGHETH A GOD
WHIRLED BY EVERY WIND UNSETTLED DRIVEN ABOUT
AWAY--MY HAPPINESS THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
MY HAND--IS A FOOL'S HAND
BY ITS OWN TORTURE DOTH IT INCREASE ITS OWN KNOWLEDGE,--DID YE KNOW THAT BEFORE
ALAS THAT THE ROSY DAWN CAME TOO EARLY TO ME
CHAPTER LXVII
AND FOR SUCH PRECEPTS TO BE CALLED HOLY WAS NOT TRUTH ITSELF THEREBY--SLAIN
YOUR MARRIAGE-ARRANGING
IT IS THE LION'S GOOD TO DEVOUR AN ANTELOPE
IT IS NOT FAR,--WILT THOU NOT ATTEND TO THY WOUNDS AT MY HOME
THOU HAST LIVED TOO CLOSELY TO THE SMALL AND THE PITIABLE
I REQUIRE PURE SMOOTH MIRRORS FOR MY DOCTRINES
BUT MINE ENEMIES SHALL THINK THAT THE EVIL ONE ROARETH OVER THEIR HEADS
CHAPTER XLII

YE KNOW ONLY THE SPARKS OF THE SPIRIT
THE APPEARANCE OF VARIETIES AMONG ANIMALS AND OF SPORTING PLANTS IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM IS STILL SHROUDED IN MYSTERY AND THE QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS NOT PRECISELY THE GROUND ON WHICH DARWIN AND NIETZSCHE WILL MEET IS AN INTERESTING ONE
A THISTLE TICKLETH THY HEART WHEN THOU CHANCEST TO BE HUNGRY
HERE WE ARE TOLD QUITE PLAINLY WHAT CLASS OF MEN ACTUALLY OWE ALL THEIR IMPULSES AND DESIRES TO THE INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION
AND BETTER MARRIAGE-BREAKING THAN MARRIAGE-BENDING MARRIAGE-LYING!--THUS SPAKE A WOMAN UNTO ME
ZARATHUSTRA CAN AGAIN SPEAK AND BESTOW AND SHOW HIS BEST LOVE TO HIS LOVED ONES
HE LOOKED WITH EYES WHICH BEHELD EVERYTHING,--HE BEHELD MEN'S DEPTHS AND DREGS ALL HIS HIDDEN IGNOMINY AND UGLINESS
BLUE ARE MY HANDS WITH HIS FRIENDLY HAND-SHAKING
TOO WELL DO I KNOW THOSE GODLIKE ONES
AND ABOVE ALL DID I LEARN STANDING AND WALKING AND RUNNING AND LEAPING AND CLIMBING AND DANCING
THE AUTHOR HIMSELF REFERS TO IT AS THE DEEPEST WORK EVER OFFERED TO THE GERMAN PUBLIC AND ELSEWHERE SPEAKS OF HIS OTHER WRITINGS AS BEING NECESSARY FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
DO I SEEM TO THEE DISCOURTEOUS
I AM AND WAS EVER YOUR COUNTERPART
SHE HATH ALAS
IT SCRATCHETH ME EVEN WHEN I TAKE IT OFF
AND THEN TALKED ZARATHUSTRA IN THIS WISE TO HIS EXULTING CONSCIENCE
WITH THUNDER AND HEAVENLY FIREWORKS MUST ONE SPEAK TO INDOLENT AND SOMNOLENT SENSES
WHERE THE STRONG ARE WEAK WHERE THE NOBLE ARE ALL-TOO-GENTLE--THERE BUILDETH IT ITS LOATHSOME NEST
AND SUCH IS ALWAYS THE NATURE OF WEAK MEN
THEY DID NOT BEGLOOM THEMSELVES TO DEATH--THAT DO PEOPLE FABRICATE
AND ERE THOU HADST RECOVERED THE SAME POISON-WORM CRAWLED OVER THY HAND
MANY A ONE HATH SAID
I AM NOT TO BE A HERDSMAN I AM NOT TO BE A GRAVE-DIGGER
THUS DID I LAUGH
AT DIFFERENT PERIODS IN HIS LIFE HE WOULD CALL THIS HAUNTER OF HIS DREAMS BY DIFFERENT NAMES
IF HOWEVER THOU HAST A SUFFERING FRIEND THEN BE A RESTING-PLACE FOR HIS SUFFERING
AWAY FROM GOD AND GODS DID THIS WILL ALLURE ME
IF THEIR FILTH HATH STILL SPIRIT IN IT
NOW NIETZSCHE'S LIFE HAD BEEN TOO FULL OF DISAPPOINTMENTS ILLNESS UNSUCCESSFUL STRUGGLES AND SNUBS TO ALLOW OF HIS THINKING OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE WITHOUT LOATHING--HENCE PROBABLY THE WORDS OF THE LAST VERSE
ALL TRUTH IS CROOKED
REFRIGERATED SPIRITS I DO NOT BELIEVE IN
AND I CRIED WITH HORROR AS I NE'ER CRIED BEFORE
WHO CAN COMMAND WHO MUST OBEY--THAT IS THERE ATTEMPTED
HITHER HITHER MINE EAGLE AND MY SERPENT
FOR FROM THE GROUND A NOISE WELLED UP GURGLING AND RATTLING AS WATER GURGLETH AND RATTLETH AT NIGHT THROUGH STOPPED-UP WATER-PIPES
THEY WANT--TO BE PAID BESIDES YE WANT TO BE PAID BESIDES YE VIRTUOUS ONES
OLD AND NEW TABLES
OLD AND NEW TABLES
OLD AND NEW TABLES
THOU HAST DIVINED I KNOW IT WELL HOW THE MAN FEELETH WHO KILLED HIM,--THE MURDERER OF GOD
THEIR JEALOUSY LEADETH THEM ALSO INTO THINKERS PATHS
LXXX
WITH THE CREATORS THE REAPERS AND THE REJOICERS WILL I ASSOCIATE
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST USEFUL QUALITIES
FOR THIS DID I ONCE SEE AND DID NOT TIRE OF WEEPING IN BEHOLDING IT LIKE THE SUN WILL ALSO ZARATHUSTRA GO DOWN
BLAMELESS ARE THEY FOR THEIR SMALL EXISTENCE BUT THEIR CIRCUMSCRIBED SOULS THINK
AND OTHERS ARE PROUD OF THEIR MODICUM OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FOR THE SAKE OF IT DO VIOLENCE TO ALL THINGS
THOU PAIN WELL
THUS ONLY DID HE BECOME--MAN
OUT OF YOU WHO HAVE CHOSEN YOURSELVES SHALL A CHOSEN PEOPLE ARISE:--AND OUT OF IT THE SUPERMAN
AT LAST BURSTETH THE FROG WHICH HATH INFLATED ITSELF TOO LONG
THOU THYSELF HOWEVER,--WARN THYSELF ALSO AGAINST THY PITY
FOR YE DOUBT WITH GOOD REASON WHETHER IT BE ALREADY THINKABLE
WITH THE HELP OF FAVOURABLE MEASURES GREAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE REARED WHO WOULD BE BOTH DIFFERENT FROM AND HIGHER THAN THOSE WHO HERETOFORE HAVE OWED THEIR EXISTENCE TO MERE CHANCE
HIS WISDOM IS TO KEEP AWAKE IN ORDER TO SLEEP WELL
HARDLY HOWEVER HAD ZARATHUSTRA SPOKEN THESE WORDS WHEN HE FELL DOWN AS ONE DEAD AND REMAINED LONG AS ONE DEAD
THE HOLY WATER HAVE THEY POISONED WITH THEIR LUSTFULNESS
BUT HIS WEAK REASON UNDERSTOOD NOT THIS MADNESS AND IT PERSUADED HIM
BOTH ALIKE HOSTILE TO ALL FLESH AND BLOOD--OH HOW REPUGNANT ARE BOTH TO MY TASTE
SUCH MISCHIEF WELLETH OUT OF MY LONESOMENESS
BITE IS BUT NIETZSCHE'S EXASPERATED CRY TO MANKIND TO ALTER THEIR VALUES BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE
SHOULD I NOT HAVE TO BE A CASK OF MEMORY IF I ALSO WANTED TO HAVE MY REASONS WITH ME
THEREUPON THE PHANTOM WITHDREW FROM ME
MUST I YET SEEK THE LAST HAPPINESS ON THE HAPPY ISLES AND FAR AWAY AMONG FORGOTTEN SEAS
HE WHO SAID GOD IS A SPIRIT'--MADE THE GREATEST STRIDE AND SLIDE HITHERTO MADE ON EARTH TOWARDS UNBELIEF
WHAT DO THEY CALL IT THAT WHICH MAKETH THEM PROUD
GLADLY WOULD I WALK WITH THEE--IN SOME LOVELIER PLACE
AND LIKE A WIND WILL I ONE DAY BLOW AMONGST THEM AND WITH MY SPIRIT TAKE THE BREATH FROM THEIR SPIRIT
WHEN THE HERO HATH ABANDONED IT THEN ONLY APPROACHETH IT IN DREAMS--THE SUPERHERO THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
FOR THEY ARE UNWORTHY OF THEE
NIBBLED BADLY
YESTERDAY TOWARDS EVENING THERE SPAKE UNTO ME MY STILLEST HOUR
PASSION FOR POWER
PASSION FOR POWER
PASSION FOR POWER
PASSION FOR POWER
YOUR NEIGHBOUR-LOVE IS YOUR BAD LOVE OF YOURSELVES
DO YE NOT FEEL THE THIRST AND THE HOT BREATH OF HER LOVE
IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL WE HEAR OFTEN ENOUGH THAT THE SELECT AND SUPERIOR MAN MUST WEAR A MASK AND HERE WE FIND THIS INJUNCTION EXPLAINED
HOW IN HIS WALKS OVER HILL AND DALE THE IDEAS WOULD CROWD INTO HIS MIND AND HOW HE WOULD NOTE THEM DOWN HASTILY IN A NOTE-BOOK FROM WHICH HE WOULD TRANSCRIBE THEM ON HIS RETURN SOMETIMES WORKING TILL MIDNIGHT
DO NOT SEAT YOURSELVES ON OTHER PEOPLE'S BACKS AND HEADS
O AFTERNOON OF MY LIFE
O AFTERNOON OF MY LIFE
O AFTERNOON OF MY LIFE
NOT WITH THEIR HATRED NOT WITH THEIR BAILIFFS;--OH SUCH PERSECUTION WOULD I MOCK AT AND BE PROUD AND CHEERFUL
BUT WHEN I SAW HIS WIFE THE EARTH SEEMED TO ME A HOME FOR MADCAPS
THAT KNOWETH NO ONE AND WE GAZED AT EACH OTHER AND LOOKED AT THE GREEN MEADOW O'ER WHICH THE COOL EVENING WAS JUST PASSING AND WE WEPT TOGETHER.--THEN HOWEVER WAS LIFE DEARER UNTO ME THAN ALL MY WISDOM HAD EVER BEEN THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
BASHFULNESS DOTH HE ENJOIN ON HIMSELF IN PRESENCE OF ALL SUFFERERS
WITH HIS LAST SIGH HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA AGAIN BECAME SERENE AND ASSURED LIKE ONE WHO HATH COME OUT OF A DEEP CHASM INTO THE LIGHT
AND AGAIN IS THE AFTERNOON AROUND ME
WHEN YE DESPISE PLEASANT THINGS AND THE EFFEMINATE COUCH AND CANNOT COUCH FAR ENOUGH FROM THE EFFEMINATE
OR THEY LISTEN TO AN OLD ROVING HOWL-AND GROWL-PIPER WHO HATH LEARNT FROM THE SAD WINDS THE SADNESS OF SOUNDS
MY CAVE IS A GOOD HAVEN
THEN DID HE GAZE LONG INTO THE FACE OF THE DISCIPLE WHO HAD BEEN THE DREAM-INTERPRETER AND SHOOK HIS HEAD XLII
ONLY MY BRETHREN SEE THAT YE SCARE THE DOGS AWAY FROM HIM THE IDLE SKULKERS AND ALL THE SWARMING VERMIN ALL THE SWARMING VERMIN OF THE CULTURED THAT--FEAST ON THE SWEAT OF EVERY HERO 19
IN THIS DISCOURSE WE GET THE BEST EXPOSITION IN THE WHOLE BOOK OF NIETZSCHE'S DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER
SHROUDED IN THICK MELANCHOLY AND EAGER FOR THE LITTLE CASUALTIES THAT BRING DEATH
IN THE AFTERNOON AS OFTEN AS MY HEALTH PERMITTED I WALKED ROUND THE WHOLE BAY FROM SANTA MARGHERITA TO BEYOND PORTO FINO
AS HOWEVER THE QUESTION IS BY NO MEANS ONE ON WHICH WE ARE ALL AGREED WHAT HE SAYS IS NOT WITHOUT VALUE
THE SPURIOUS WISE HOWEVER ALL THE PRIESTS THE WORLD-WEARY AND THOSE WHOSE SOULS ARE OF FEMININE AND SERVILE NATURE--OH HOW HATH THEIR GAME ALL ALONG ABUSED SELFISHNESS
BETHINKST THOU STILL BETHINKST THOU BURNING HEART HOW THEN THOU THIRSTEDEST THAT I SHOULD BANNED BE FROM ALL THE TRUENESS
AN AWAKENED ONE IS ZARATHUSTRA
TO BE ABLE TO SMILE WHILE SPEAKING OF LOFTY THINGS AND NOT TO BE OPPRESSED BY THEM IS THE SECRET OF REAL GREATNESS
SPIT RATHER ON THE GATE OF THE CITY AND--TURN BACK
BY DEPRIVING A MAN OF HIS WICKEDNESS--MORE PARTICULARLY NOWADAYS THEREFORE ONE MAY UNWITTINGLY BE DOING VIOLENCE TO THE GREATEST IN HIM
THE SEAS TREMBLE AND LEAP UNDER ITS FOOTSTEPS
I DIVINE THEE WELL
WHO WOULD NOT LOVE THEE THOU INNOCENT IMPATIENT WIND-SWIFT CHILD-EYED SINNER
HAST THOU EVER KNOWN MY BROTHER THE WORD DISDAIN
TO HIM HOWEVER WHO IS POSSESSED OF A DEVIL I WOULD WHISPER THIS WORD IN THE EAR
A NECESSITY WAS IT MERELY AND A MAKESHIFT OF THE UNHANDY ONE:--TO FLY ONLY WANTETH MINE ENTIRE WILL TO FLY INTO THEE
AND WHENEVER I LIFT A CURTAIN A NIGHT-MOTH RUSHETH OUT OF IT
WHEN HOWEVER WINTER COMES AND THE STREAM GETS FROZEN MANY INQUIRE
HE WHO LIVETH AMONGST THE GOOD--PITY TEACHETH HIM TO LIE
SO THEIR JOY WAS GREAT WHEN ON THE FIFTH DAY ZARATHUSTRA APPEARED AMONGST THEM
TERRIBLE IS ALONENESS WITH THE JUDGE AND AVENGER OF ONE'S OWN LAW
WAS THAT LIFE
AND HIS LOWING SHOULD ALSO LAUD ALL THAT IS EARTHLY
WOE TO US
AH THAT HIS BADDEST IS SO VERY SMALL
LOVE IS THE DANGER OF THE LONESOMEST ONE LOVE TO ANYTHING IF IT ONLY LIVE
MY BROTHER WHEN THOU HAST A VIRTUE AND IT IS THINE OWN VIRTUE THOU HAST IT IN COMMON WITH NO ONE
WELL NOW
SET AROUND YOU SMALL GOOD PERFECT THINGS YE HIGHER MEN
BUT MY BLOOD IS RELATED TO THEIRS
BUT WHO COULD REJOICE AT THAT THOU SERVEDST HIM TO THE LAST ASKED ZARATHUSTRA THOUGHTFULLY AFTER A DEEP SILENCE THOU KNOWEST HOW HE DIED
AND IF YOUR HARDNESS WILL NOT GLANCE AND CUT AND CHIP TO PIECES HOW CAN YE ONE DAY--CREATE WITH ME
TOWARDS THE FEW THE LONG THE REMOTE GO FORTH MY SOUL AND MY SEEKING
THAT IS AN EAR
IT IS TIME FOR MAN TO PLANT THE GERM OF HIS HIGHEST HOPE
THERE FLED HE SURELY MY FINAL ONLY COMRADE MY GREATEST FOE MINE UNFAMILIAR MY HANGMAN-GOD
IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS APPLIES TO ALL THOSE BREATHLESS AND HASTY TASTERS OF EVERYTHING WHO PLUNGE TOO RASHLY INTO THE SEA OF INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND HERESY AND WHO HAVING MISCALCULATED THEIR STRENGTH FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THEIR HEAD ABOVE WATER
VERILY HE WHO POSSESSETH LITTLE IS SO MUCH THE LESS POSSESSED
THEN DID HE BEGIN TO SPEAK THUS
THIS IS MY GOOD AND EVIL
ONE SEETH HE DOTH NOT KNOW THE GOOD OCCIDENTALS THIS SAGE OUT OF THE ORIENT
WHAT GOOD IS MY REASON
AND RATHER DESPAIR THAN SUBMIT YOURSELVES
IN MY DOMAIN THEY BECOME ASSURED
AND BLESSED IS HE WHO THUS BLESSETH
HERDSMEN I SAY BUT THEY CALL THEMSELVES THE BELIEVERS IN THE ORTHODOX BELIEF
OR DID IT LEARN IT FROM ME
DISGUISED DID I SIT AMONGST THEM READY TO MISJUDGE MYSELF THAT I MIGHT ENDURE THEM AND WILLINGLY SAYING TO MYSELF
MAN IS SOMETHING THAT IS TO BE SURPASSED
MAN IS SOMETHING THAT IS TO BE SURPASSED
IN FACT THE GREATEST VIRTUE OF HIS WORKS IS PERHAPS THE SUBTLETY WITH WHICH THEY IMPOSE THE OBLIGATION UPON ONE OF THINKING ALONE OF SCORING OFF ONE'S OWN BAT AND OF SHIFTING INTELLECTUALLY FOR ONESELF
THEY STILL SLEEP IN MY CAVE
MY FRIENDS--THAT IS MY MOST UNBEARABLE TROUBLE
AND IT IS ALSO A WORLD
CANST THOU ALSO COMPEL STARS TO REVOLVE AROUND THEE
THEY DO NOT SPEAK OUT THEY ONLY HINT
SMALL SPIRITS AND SPACIOUS SOULS HAD THOSE SHEPHERDS
AH HOW I AM WEARY OF THE POETS
LET IT BE HIS BEST CURE TO SEE WITH HIS EYES HIM WHO MAKETH HIMSELF WHOLE
ALAS WILT THOU AGAIN DRAG THY BODY THYSELF ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED
WE NOW MEET WITH ZARATHUSTRA IN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES
WOEFUL
O MY BRETHREN IS NOT EVERYTHING AT PRESENT IN FLUX
WITH ITS DELIGHT ENRAPTURETH IT THE SPIRIT
AND ALL THE WHISPERING
FOR THAT PURPOSE HOWEVER IT NEEDETH GOOD ACTORS
AND ART THOU THIRSTY--I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING
AND LOST BE THE DAY TO US IN WHICH A MEASURE HATH NOT BEEN DANCED
IN NATURE EVERY SPECIES OF ORGANIC BEING INSTINCTIVELY ADOPTS AND PRACTISES THOSE ACTS WHICH MOST CONDUCE TO THE PREVALENCE OR SUPREMACY OF ITS KIND
LET US SEE THAT IT DOTH NOT BRING A PLAGUE UPON US AND RECENTLY DID A WOMAN SEIZE UPON HER CHILD THAT WAS COMING UNTO ME
IN YOU BREAK THEY FORTH AS FLAME AND FRENZY OF VENGEANCE
COWARDICE AND MEDIOCRITY ARE THE NAMES WITH WHICH HE LABELS MODERN NOTIONS OF VIRTUE AND MODERATION
HOW COULDST THOU A SHREWD MAN DO SUCH A STUPID THING O ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED THE SHREWD MAGICIAN THOU ART RIGHT IT WAS A STUPID THING,--IT WAS ALSO REPUGNANT TO ME AND THOU EVEN SAID ZARATHUSTRA TO THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE CONSIDER AND PUT THY FINGER TO THY NOSE
A FINE THING THAT ZARATHUSTRA HATH TURNED A GRAVE-DIGGER
UNTO ITS OWN PIPING WILL IT DANCE
I NO LONGER FEEL IN COMMON WITH YOU
YE HAVE COME UNTO ME ONLY AS A PRESAGE THAT HIGHER ONES ARE ON THE WAY TO ME NOT THE MEN OF GREAT LONGING OF GREAT LOATHING OF GREAT SATIETY AND THAT WHICH YE CALL THE REMNANT OF GOD
HOW THEY SIGHED OUR FATHERS WHEN THEY SAW ON THE WALL BRIGHTLY FURBISHED DRIED-UP SWORDS
HE ALMOST STARVED ON HIS EXPECTATIONS
WHEN HOWEVER HE WANDERED ON AND ON UPHILL AND DOWN AT TIMES PAST GREEN MEADOWS THOUGH ALSO SOMETIMES OVER WILD STONY COUCHES WHERE FORMERLY PERHAPS AN IMPATIENT BROOK HAD MADE ITS BED THEN HE TURNED ALL AT ONCE WARMER AND HEARTIER AGAIN
AMONG THE DAUGHTERS OF THE DESERT
OR TO TELL YOU IT MORE CANDIDLY
THE STRONG LION HOWEVER LICKED ALWAYS THE TEARS THAT FELL ON ZARATHUSTRA'S HANDS AND ROARED AND GROWLED SHYLY
THAT WAS THY SOREST DREAM
COURAGE
I HAVE DIVINED YOU WELL!--BUT SHAME IS IN YOUR LOVE AND A BAD CONSCIENCE--YE ARE LIKE THE MOON
NO ONE KNOWETH ANY LONGER HOW TO UNDERSTAND
IT IS THAT PRECISELY THAT WE RUN AWAY FROM
WE MUST BE CAREFUL TO SEPARATE THIS PARAGRAPH IN SENSE FROM THE PREVIOUS FOUR PARAGRAPHS
AND IF HE FOUNDED MONASTERIES AND INSCRIBED OVER THEIR PORTALS
AS YET HAVE I NOT BEEN STRONG ENOUGH FOR MY FINAL LION-WANTONNESS AND PLAYFULNESS
ABASHED DID HE DRAW IN HIS TAIL SAID BOW-WOW IN A COWED VOICE AND CREPT DOWN INTO HIS CAVE THUS TOLD ZARATHUSTRA
AND ONLY WHEN HE TURNETH AWAY FROM HIMSELF WILL HE O'ERLEAP HIS OWN SHADOW--AND VERILY
EMPTY ARE STILL MANY SITES FOR LONE ONES AND TWAIN ONES AROUND WHICH FLOATETH THE ODOUR OF TRANQUIL SEAS
THAT IS WHAT THE NAME ZARATHUSTRA MEANS IN MY MOUTH ELIZABETH FORSTER-NIETZSCHE
19
THUS SPEAK AND STAMMER
BY MEANS OF IT NIETZSCHE PAYS A HIGH TRIBUTE TO THE HONESTY OF THE TRUE SPECIALIST WHILE IN REPRESENTING HIM AS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN RESIST THE DEMONIACAL INFLUENCE OF THE MAGICIAN'S MUSIC HE ELEVATES HIM AT A STROKE ABOVE ALL THOSE PRESENT
AND IF THOU WILT GO THOU IMPATIENT ONE GO NOT THE WAY THAT I CAME
IN THE AUTUMN OF 1886 I CHANCED TO BE THERE AGAIN WHEN HE WAS REVISITING THIS SMALL FORGOTTEN WORLD OF HAPPINESS FOR THE LAST TIME
FOR JUST THEN WENT THE FULL MOON SILENT AS DEATH OVER THE HOUSE
FOR MAN IS THE CRUELLEST ANIMAL
THY NEIGHBOURS WILL ALWAYS BE POISONOUS FLIES
AND SOMETIMES ALSO DO I FIND A FUGITIVE CREATURE IN MY DOVECOTE WHICH IS ALIEN TO ME AND TREMBLETH WHEN I LAY MY HAND UPON IT
I LEARNED TO FLY
BUT THUS WOULD I HAVE IT UNTIL THE CREATING WILL SAITH THERETO
BUT WHAT DOTH IT MATTER TO ME ABOUT YOUR GOOD PEOPLE
THEN GO UP TO MY CAVE
SO I WILL APPEAL TO THEIR PRIDE
WHAT MATTER ABOUT THEIR MOCKERY
SO I AM IN THE RIGHT ABOUT THEE
OVER THE STREAM ALL IS STABLE ALL THE VALUES OF THINGS THE BRIDGES AND BEARINGS ALL GOOD AND EVIL
THAT IT MAY LEARN LONESOMENESS AND DEFIANCE AND PRUDENCE
SMOOTH SHALL IT BECOME AND SUBJECT TO THE SPIRIT AS ITS MIRROR AND REFLECTION
BAD--THAT IS COWARDLY CONTEMPTIBLE SEEM TO IT THE EVER-SOLICITOUS THE SIGHING THE COMPLAINING AND WHOEVER PICK UP THE MOST TRIFLING ADVANTAGE
BUT THE SPIRIT OF THE LION SAITH I WILL THOU-SHALT LIETH IN ITS PATH SPARKLING WITH GOLD--A SCALE-COVERED BEAST
NOW DO I SPEAK UNTO THEM AS UNTO THE GOATHERDS
AGAIN THE GOOD AND JUST THROUGHOUT THE BOOK IS THE EXPRESSION USED IN REFERRING TO THE SELF-RIGHTEOUS OF MODERN TIMES,--THOSE WHO ARE QUITE SURE THAT THEY KNOW ALL THAT IS TO BE KNOWN CONCERNING GOOD AND EVIL AND ARE SATISFIED THAT THE VALUES THEIR LITTLE WORLD OF TRADITION HAS HANDED DOWN TO THEM ARE DESTINED TO RULE MANKIND AS LONG AS IT LASTS
AND THE DREAMS AND PRATINGS OF ALL PERIODS WERE EVEN REALER THAN YOUR AWAKENESS
FOR ONLY BY MEANS OF ITS HEROES CAN THE HUMAN RACE BE LED FORWARD STEP BY STEP TO HIGHER AND YET HIGHER LEVELS
BUT IT IS THE KINGDOM OF THE POPULACE--I NO LONGER ALLOW ANYTHING TO BE IMPOSED UPON ME
THOU FORCEST MANY TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THEE
THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS ACCORDING TO NIETZSCHE HAS NOW BEEN REACHED
THEY INSIST ON BEING BELIEVED IN AND THAT DOUBT IS SIN
I AM NOT PUT OUT OF CONCEIT WITH THE WICKED BY YOUR TIMOROUSNESS
FOR THE CAVE WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN FULL OF NOISE AND LAUGHTER BECAME ALL AT ONCE STILL AS DEATH;--HIS NOSE HOWEVER SMELT A SWEET-SCENTED VAPOUR AND INCENSE-ODOUR AS IF FROM BURNING PINE-CONES
FOR INSTANCE THE IDEAL OF THE SUPERMAN IS PUT FORTH QUITE CLEARLY IN ALL HIS WRITINGS DURING THE YEARS 1873-75
THERE IS SO MUCH LUSTING FOR LOFTINESS
THE SKIN OF THE BEAST OF PREY THE SPECKLED SKIN AND THE DISHEVELLED LOCKS OF THE INVESTIGATOR THE SEARCHER AND THE CONQUEROR
THE CHOICEST DAINTIES FIND NO TASTERS
AND THE BEST IS STILL SOMETHING THAT MUST BE SURPASSED O MY BRETHREN THERE IS MUCH WISDOM IN THE FACT THAT MUCH FILTH IS IN THE WORLD 15
OF THIS DISCOURSE WE MEET WITH A DOCTRINE NOT TOUCHED UPON HITHERTO SAVE INDIRECTLY;--I REFER TO THE DOCTRINE OF SELF-LOVE
AND IT LASTED LONG
NOW BESIDE ME
TO THE HEART
VIOLENTLY WILL IT BLOW ITS STORM OVER THE MOUNTAINS
ONWARD
THERE COMETH THE TARANTULA WILLINGLY
A WANDERER AM I WHO HAVE WALKED LONG AT THY HEELS
CHAPTER I
THEN WAS THERE ONCE MORE SPOKEN UNTO ME WITHOUT VOICE
I POSSESS YOU MY CHILDREN
ZARATHUSTRA HAD MORE COURAGE IN HIS BODY THAN ANY OTHER THINKER BEFORE OR AFTER HIM
TO ALL WORMY WOOD TO ALL STINKING RAGS THE PREPARED HEAT AND STEW FURNACE
BUT NOW DO I WANT TO SEE ALSO THE EYE OF THE ANGEL
HATEFUL UNTO ME ARE ALL THAT SLINK AROUND HALF-CLOSED WINDOWS
BUT THEY MUST COME AND GO AT THE RIGHT TIME
HIS SECOND COMPANIONS HOWEVER--THEY WILL CALL THEMSELVES HIS BELIEVERS,--WILL BE A LIVING HOST WITH MUCH LOVE MUCH FOLLY MUCH UNBEARDED VENERATION
BUT INTO EVERY DEFECT HAD THEY PUT THEIR ILLUSION THEIR STOP-GAP WHICH THEY CALLED GOD
IT WAS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON ONLY WHEN ZARATHUSTRA AFTER LONG USELESS SEARCHING AND STROLLING ABOUT AGAIN CAME HOME TO HIS CAVE
BUT WHAT IS WOMAN FOR MAN
THEN HE SPAKE THUS
AND LET THIS BE THE TEACHING OF YOUR VIRTUE
EVERYTHING TAKETH FROM ME NOTHING GIVETH
A HANDBREADTH OF BASIS
AND ALSO IN DISCERNING DO I FEEL ONLY MY WILL'S PROCREATING AND EVOLVING DELIGHT
O MY BRETHREN THERE ARE TABLES WHICH WEARINESS FRAMED AND TABLES WHICH SLOTHFULNESS FRAMED CORRUPT SLOTHFULNESS
DO YE KNOW THE TERROR OF HIM WHO FALLETH ASLEEP TO THE VERY TOES HE IS TERRIFIED BECAUSE THE GROUND GIVETH WAY UNDER HIM AND THE DREAM BEGINNETH
WHY DID THE GHOST CRY
WHAT WOULD THERE BE TO CREATE HE ASKS IF THERE WERE--GODS HIS IDEAL THE SUPERMAN LENDS HIM THE CHEERFULNESS NECESSARY TO THE OVERCOMING OF THAT DESPAIR USUALLY ATTENDANT UPON GODLESSNESS AND UPON THE APPARENT AIMLESSNESS OF A WORLD WITHOUT A GOD
AH LOATHING
NOW SHALT THOU COMMAND
THEY HAVE DEVISED RUMINATING AND LYING IN THE SUN
AND HERE ARE MANY WHO HAVE MADE LONG JOURNEYS
SO MUCH JUSTICE AND PITY SO MUCH WEAKNESS
THE WISE SERPENT HOWEVER HUNG ROUND ITS NECK
AND WHEN ZARATHUSTRA LOOKED INTO HIS EYES HIS HEART WAS STARTLED ONCE MORE
BUT BY MY LOVE AND HOPE I CONJURE THEE
BUT BY MY LOVE AND HOPE I CONJURE THEE
NOT THAT YOUR FAMILY HAVE BECOME COURTLY AT COURTS AND THAT YE HAVE LEARNED--GAY-COLOURED LIKE THE FLAMINGO--TO STAND LONG HOURS IN SHALLOW POOLS
THOU THYSELF SEEMEST TO ME AWAKENED
AT THIS PLACE IN THE LITANY HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA COULD NO LONGER CONTROL HIMSELF
I AM ENCHANTED AND VERILY I HAVE ALREADY PROMPTINGS TO MAKE A RHYME THEREON EVEN IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE A RHYME NOT SUITED FOR EVERY ONE'S EARS
BLESSED BLESSED BE THE VINTNER'S KNIFE
JEALOUS IS EVERY VIRTUE OF THE OTHERS AND A DREADFUL THING IS JEALOUSY
BETTER THAN MAN DOTH WOMAN UNDERSTAND CHILDREN BUT MAN IS MORE CHILDISH THAN WOMAN
FOR AT THIS POINT THE SOOTHSAYER INTERRUPTED THE GREETING OF ZARATHUSTRA AND HIS GUESTS
MY STOMACH--IS SURELY AN EAGLE'S STOMACH
IT IS A MORE UPRIGHT AND PURE VOICE
THE DEW FALLETH ON THE GRASS WHEN THE NIGHT IS MOST SILENT AND I ANSWERED
THE GIANT CHANCE HAS HITHERTO PLAYED WITH THE PUPPET MAN,"--THIS IS THE FACT HE CANNOT CONTEMPLATE WITH EQUANIMITY
A NEW CHILD
AND IT IS NOT THE MOUTHFUL WHICH HATH MOST CHOKED ME TO KNOW THAT LIFE ITSELF REQUIRETH ENMITY AND DEATH AND TORTURE-CROSSES BUT I ASKED ONCE AND SUFFOCATED ALMOST WITH MY QUESTION
THEY ARE INFLAMED AND SEEK COOLNESS FROM FROZEN SPIRITS
THE DAY DIETH OUT UNTO ALL THINGS COMETH NOW THE EVENING ALSO UNTO THE BEST THINGS
THE MOST DANGEROUS WISHES DID I PURSUE,--VERILY BEYOND EVERY CRIME DID I ONCE GO
AH OFTTIMES BECAME I WEARY OF SPIRIT WHEN I FOUND EVEN THE RABBLE SPIRITUAL
EVEN WITHOUT PLUMES
FOR THEY ARE THY WARMEST FRIENDS AND PRECEPTORS ONE EXCEPTED WHOM I HOLD STILL DEARER ANSWERED THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR
IT CREEPETH AND HIDETH AND WANTETH TO BE NOWHERE--UNTIL THE WHOLE BODY IS DECAYED AND WITHERED BY THE PETTY INFECTION
WHAT DOTH THAT MATTER TO ZARATHUSTRA
WHAT DOTH THAT MATTER TO ZARATHUSTRA
FREEDOM FROM FEVER IS STILL FAR FROM BEING KNOWLEDGE WHERE A MAN'S EMOTIONS CEASE TO ACCOMPANY HIM IN HIS INVESTIGATIONS HE IS NOT NECESSARILY NEARER THE TRUTH
YE HIGHER MEN
IT IS THE TYPE THAT TAKES LIFE AND ITSELF TOO SERIOUSLY THAT NEVER SURMOUNTS THE CAMEL-STAGE MENTIONED IN THE FIRST DISCOURSE AND THAT IS OBDURATELY SUBLIME AND EARNEST
PERHAPS OF ME
UNPITYINGLY DOTH IT PURSUE ITS COURSE
SO WILLETH MY WILL
GOD IS A THOUGHT--IT MAKETH ALL THE STRAIGHT CROOKED AND ALL THAT STANDETH REEL
MOREOVER IN HIS OBJECTIONS MANY DIFFICULTIES ARE RAISED WHICH ARE NOT SETTLED BY AN APPEAL TO EITHER OF THE MEN ABOVE MENTIONED
AND THOUGH HE WAS THEN AS SOME NARRATORS SUPPOSE FULL OF SWEET WINE HE WAS CERTAINLY STILL FULLER OF SWEET LIFE AND HAD RENOUNCED ALL WEARINESS
HATH SOLITUDE SWALLOWED HIM UP
NIETZSCHE WOULD BE A HARD BED TO HIGHER MEN
WHY SUFFICETH NOT THE BEAST OF BURDEN WHICH RENOUNCETH AND IS REVERENT
AFTER THE SONG OF THE WANDERER AND SHADOW THE CAVE BECAME ALL AT ONCE FULL OF NOISE AND LAUGHTER
THOU LIEST IN THE GRASS
HE WHOM THE FLAME OF JEALOUSY ENCOMPASSETH TURNETH AT LAST LIKE THE SCORPION THE POISONED STING AGAINST HIMSELF
ROUND FAIR AND CONSIDERATE ARE THEY TO ONE ANOTHER AS GRAINS OF SAND ARE ROUND FAIR AND CONSIDERATE TO GRAINS OF SAND
RATHER HARBOUR THERE--WITH MY CHILDREN
THEN RAN ZARATHUSTRA UP SPEEDILY AND DROVE THE ANIMALS ASIDE
AND ONCE THOU ART AWAKE THEN SHALT THOU EVER REMAIN AWAKE
WE LOVE EACH OTHER
WHAT IS LOVABLE IN MAN IS THAT HE IS AN OVER-GOING AND A DOWN-GOING
THIS IS MY FIRST MANLY PRUDENCE THAT I ALLOW MYSELF TO BE DECEIVED SO AS NOT TO BE ON MY GUARD AGAINST DECEIVERS
HE SAYS THERE ARE NO ABSOLUTE VALUES GOOD AND EVIL
WHAT WERE THY TEN OVERCOMINGS
TO YOU MUST I NOW GO DOWN
BE OF GOOD CHEER
WHEN HOWEVER WE RETURNED TO SWITZERLAND TOWARDS THE END OF JUNE AND HE FOUND HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE FAMILIAR AND EXHILARATING AIR OF THE MOUNTAINS ALL HIS JOYOUS CREATIVE POWERS REVIVED AND IN A NOTE TO ME ANNOUNCING THE DISPATCH OF SOME MANUSCRIPT HE WROTE AS FOLLOWS
I MADE A NOTE OF THE THOUGHT ON A SHEET OF PAPER WITH THE POSTSCRIPT
HERE AM I STILL LIKE A COCK IN A STRANGE FARM-YARD AT WHICH EVEN THE HENS PECK
WHO STILL WANTETH TO OBEY
WHAT MATTER IF IT BE GREAT OR SMALL
THAT IS DELIGHT TO THE LION-WILLED
FORGIVE ME O GOD ALL SUCH SPEECH-SINNING SIT I HERE THE BEST OF AIR SNIFFLING PARADISAL AIR TRULY BRIGHT AND BUOYANT AIR GOLDEN-MOTTLED AS GOODLY AIR AS EVER FROM LUNAR ORB DOWNFELL BE IT BY HAZARD OR SUPERVENED IT BY ARROGANCY
SEE O ZARATHUSTRA HOW FRIEND ONLY COMETH UNTO FRIEND BUT WHY TALK I WHEN NO ONE HATH MINE EARS
TWO ROADS COME TOGETHER HERE
BEHOLD WE KNOW WHAT THOU TEACHEST
I AM JUST IT ALWAYS SOUNDETH LIKE
AND HE WHO PROCLAIMETH THE EGO WHOLESOME AND HOLY AND SELFISHNESS BLESSED VERILY HE THE PROGNOSTICATOR SPEAKETH ALSO WHAT HE KNOWETH
THE CASE OF ZARATHUSTRA PROVES THAT ONE CAN SPEAK WITH THE UTMOST CLEARNESS AND YET NOT BE HEARD BY ANY ONE MY BROTHER WAS VERY MUCH DISCOURAGED BY THE FEEBLENESS OF THE RESPONSE HE WAS GIVEN AND AS HE WAS STRIVING JUST THEN TO GIVE UP THE PRACTICE OF TAKING HYDRATE OF CHLORAL--A DRUG HE HAD BEGUN TO TAKE WHILE ILL WITH INFLUENZA,--THE FOLLOWING SPRING SPENT IN ROME WAS A SOMEWHAT GLOOMY ONE FOR HIM
FOR THERE WAS A GOOD ROADSTEAD THERE IN WHICH FOREIGN SHIPS ALSO LIKED TO ANCHOR
WITH RESPECT TO WHAT IS PAST HE SAYS I HAVE LIKE ALL DISCERNING ONES GREAT TOLERATION THAT IS TO SAY GENEROUS SELF-CONTROL...BUT MY FEELING CHANGES SUDDENLY AND BREAKS OUT AS SOON AS I ENTER THE MODERN PERIOD OUR PERIOD
BUT I BIT OFF ITS HEAD AND SPAT IT AWAY FROM ME
MAN IS SOMETHING THAT MUST BE SURPASSED
AND NOT MUCH LONGER DO THEY STAND
WOULDST THOU SEEK THE WAY UNTO THYSELF
AND AS STRONG WINDS WILL WE LIVE ABOVE THEM NEIGHBOURS TO THE EAGLES NEIGHBOURS TO THE SNOW NEIGHBOURS TO THE SUN
MY HOME LONESOMENESS
MY HOME LONESOMENESS
IT PRESSETH ME AND WILL NOT LEAVE ME AND IS LIKE MOLTEN PITCH THEN WENT HIS ANIMALS AGAIN THOUGHTFULLY AROUND HIM AND PLACED THEMSELVES ONCE MORE IN FRONT OF HIM
BLESSED BE MODERATE POVERTY AND WHY HE WISHETH TO DO AWAY WITH BEGGARS BE OF GOOD CHEER REPLIED ZARATHUSTRA AS I AM
AND WELL DID I DIVINE ALL THEIR FLY-HAPPINESS AND THEIR BUZZING AROUND SUNNY WINDOW-PANES
ICH BIN DER ERSTE DIENER DES STAATES I AM THE FIRST SERVANT OF THE STATE TO THIS UTTERANCE OF THE GREAT SOVEREIGN VERSE 24 UNDOUBTEDLY REFERS
WAILING AND TEETH-GNASHING DID HE PROMISE US
THIS DAY IS A VICTORY
VERSES 27 TO 31 UNDOUBTEDLY REFER TO RICHARD WAGNER SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LXV CHAPTER XXXIV
VERILY THROUGH A HUNDRED SOULS WENT I MY WAY AND THROUGH A HUNDRED CRADLES AND BIRTH-THROES
VERILY ON SOFT SOLES DOTH IT COME TO ME THE DEAREST OF THIEVES AND STEALETH FROM ME MY THOUGHTS
AND LIII
HE THEN PUT THE DEAD MAN IN A HOLLOW TREE AT HIS HEAD--FOR HE WANTED TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE WOLVES--AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN ON THE GROUND AND MOSS
EVERY ONE IS EQUAL
THOU NOONTIDE SLEEPER
ALTHOUGH THEY SPEAK SIMILARLY THEY WANT TO BE HEARD DIFFERENTLY SEE THIS LANGUISHING ONE
UTTERANCE HAVE I BECOME ALTOGETHER AND THE BRAWLING OF A BROOK FROM HIGH ROCKS
THE LAST LINES WERE WRITTEN PRECISELY IN THE HALLOWED HOUR WHEN RICHARD WAGNER GAVE UP THE GHOST IN VENICE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TEN DAYS OCCUPIED IN COMPOSING THE FIRST PART OF THIS BOOK MY BROTHER OFTEN REFERRED TO THIS WINTER AS THE HARDEST AND SICKLIEST HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED
A THOUSAND GOALS HAVE THERE BEEN HITHERTO FOR A THOUSAND PEOPLES HAVE THERE BEEN
NOT GRATUITOUSLY SHALL HE HERE SING SONGS IN HONOUR OF ENMITY YEA IT HATH REVENGED ITSELF
SIMILES ARE ALL NAMES OF GOOD AND EVIL
HE DID NOT DIVINE THE SERPENT'S COIL WITH WHICH IT WAS STUFFED
AND ABOVE ME--WHAT ROSY RED STILLNESS
THAT THOU HAST DONE IT UNTO THYSELF HOWEVER--HOW COULD I FORGIVE THAT THUS SPEAKETH ALL GREAT LOVE
IN HIS TEACHING HE DOES NOT COERCE US NOR DOES HE OVERPERSUADE
DID I PERHAPS LEARN FROM IT THE LONG CLEAR SILENCE
ALWAYS ONCE ONE--THAT MAKETH TWO IN THE LONG RUN I AND ME ARE ALWAYS TOO EARNESTLY IN CONVERSATION
O MY SOUL THERE IS NOWHERE A SOUL WHICH COULD BE MORE LOVING AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND MORE EXTENSIVE
SAYS SPENCER IN THE PREFACE TO HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY:--"IN THE GENESIS OF A SYSTEM OF THOUGHT THE EMOTIONAL NATURE IS A LARGE FACTOR
SO DO NOT UPBRAID HIM WHO ASCENDETH BEYOND YOU INTO HIS HEIGHT
AND CHAPTER LI CHAPTER XXX
ERE NIGHT COMETH WILL HE AGAIN LEARN TO LOVE AND LAUD ME
SERPENT-DEATH ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER BECAME ABSORBED IN DARK RECOLLECTIONS FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF HE HAD ONCE BEFORE STOOD IN THIS VALLEY
VIII
VIII
I CARRY THEE TO THE PLACE WHERE I SHALL BURY THEE WITH MINE OWN HANDS
DID YE EVER KNOW THIS
WHERE DO I FIND MINE EQUAL
YONDER IS THE GRAVE-ISLAND THE SILENT ISLE
ALSO ALL OVER-DISTRUSTFUL WISDOM,--FOR SUCH IS THE MODE OF COWARDLY SOULS
THUS DID THE WORLD STAND ON MY PROMONTORY AS IF DELICATE HANDS CARRIED A CASKET TOWARDS ME--A CASKET OPEN FOR THE DELECTATION OF MODEST ADORING EYES
THEN WILL WE MAKE THEE A PRESENT OF THE SUPERMAN AND ALL THE PEOPLE EXULTED AND SMACKED THEIR LIPS
HIS ARM ACROSS HIS HEAD
MY SIGHING AND QUESTIONING CROAKED AND CHOKED AND GNAWED AND NAGGED DAY AND NIGHT
SAD ENOUGH
SEE THAT A STILL WORSE EVENING DOTH NOT OVERTAKE THEE
HALT DWARF SAID I
AND THE SPIDER
O ZARATHUSTRA THOU STONE OF WISDOM THOU SLING-STONE THOU STAR-DESTROYER
AND THEREFORE O MY SOUL WILT THOU RATHER SMILE THAN POUR FORTH THY GRIEF THAN IN GUSHING TEARS POUR FORTH ALL THY GRIEF CONCERNING THY FULNESS AND CONCERNING THE CRAVING OF THE VINE FOR THE VINTAGER AND VINTAGE-KNIFE
YOUR ENEMY SHALL YE SEEK
THEN AROSE ZARATHUSTRA AND SAID TO HIS HEART
BUT WILT THOU NOT TO-DAY ASCEND A HIGH MOUNTAIN
MINE ANIMALS ARE AWAKE FOR I AM AWAKE
NOURISHED WITH INNOCENT THINGS AND WITH FEW READY AND IMPATIENT TO FLY TO FLY AWAY--THAT IS NOW MY NATURE
THAT IS ALL ITS FERVOUR
WHEN WILT THOU DRINK THIS DROP OF DEW THAT FELL DOWN UPON ALL EARTHLY THINGS,--WHEN WILT THOU DRINK THIS STRANGE SOUL WHEN THOU WELL OF ETERNITY
VERILY LIKE PENITENTIAL PREACHERS AND FOOLS DID I CRY WRATH AND SHAME ON ALL THEIR GREATNESS AND SMALLNESS
THEN HE LOOKED INQUIRINGLY ALOFT,--FOR HE HEARD ABOVE HIM THE SHARP CALL OF A BIRD
HE THAT KNOCKETH AT MY DOOR MUST TAKE WHAT I OFFER HIM
LONG HAVE THEY TO WAIT UNTIL THEY KNOW WHAT HATH FALLEN INTO THEIR DEPTHS
WHAT WISDOM IN KINGS
YEA
YEA
YEA
DOTH IT NOT RUSH AND ROAR OUT OF THE DEPTH?"--ZARATHUSTRA WAS SILENT ONCE MORE AND LISTENED
THE NEW WOULD THE NOBLE MAN CREATE AND A NEW VIRTUE
INEFFABLE
THOU WARNEDST--THE FIRST TO DO SO--AGAINST PITY:--NOT EVERY ONE NOT NONE BUT THYSELF AND THY TYPE
RAISE NOT A FINGER AGAINST IT
NOT YOUR SYMPATHY BUT YOUR BRAVERY HATH HITHERTO SAVED THE VICTIMS
I AM READY
I AM READY
WILT THOU NOT SET THYSELF AGAIN UPON THY FEET
THE BLIND WILL TO POWER IN NATURE THEREFORE STANDS IN URGENT NEED OF DIRECTION BY MAN
AND VERILY I WILL YET SHOW HIM A SEA IN WHICH HE CAN DROWN HIMSELF THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
YE SAY YE BELIEVE IN ZARATHUSTRA
THAT I MAY NOT TURN DIZZY HOWEVER BIND ME FAST MY FRIENDS TO THIS PILLAR
THREE HEAVY QUESTIONS HAVE I THROWN IN
HERE WE FIRST GET A DIRECT HINT CONCERNING NIETZSCHE'S FUNDAMENTAL PASSION--THE MAIN FORCE BEHIND ALL HIS NEW VALUES AND SCATHING CRITICISM OF EXISTING VALUES
THERE DOTH THE HEART BECOME GIDDY THROUGH ITS DOUBLE WILL
THOU HEARKENEST UNTO MY STRANGE SOUL
AND BLESSEDNESS MUST IT SEEM TO YOU TO PRESS YOUR HAND UPON MILLENNIUMS AS UPON WAX BLESSEDNESS TO WRITE UPON THE WILL OF MILLENNIUMS AS UPON BRASS,--HARDER THAN BRASS NOBLER THAN BRASS
SCARCELY AS THE TWINKLE OF DIVINE EYES DID IT COME TO ME--AS A FLEETING GLEAM
A CAVERN BECAME THE HUMAN EARTH TO ME
THOU GLOWING ONE
XX
XX
TO GO INTO FOUL WATER WHEN IT IS THE WATER OF TRUTH AND NOT DISCLAIM COLD FROGS AND HOT TOADS
IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME--IF ONLY THEY PASS AWAY QUICKLY THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
AND LET EVERYTHING BREAK UP WHICH--CAN BREAK UP BY OUR TRUTHS
YEA I KNOW IT BUT I WILL NOT SPEAK IT THEN WAS THERE AGAIN SPOKEN UNTO ME WITHOUT VOICE
WHO WOULD NOT HATE THEE THOU GREAT BINDRESS INWINDRESS TEMPTRESS SEEKRESS FINDRESS
NIETZSCHE IS STILL DEALING WITH PESSIMISM HERE
AY
BUT WHAT DOST THOU BRING US AS A GIFT WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD HEARD THESE WORDS HE BOWED TO THE SAINT AND SAID
OR THAT I WISHED HENCEFORTH TO MAKE SNUGGER COUCHES FOR YOU SUFFERERS
OR THAT I WISHED HENCEFORTH TO MAKE SNUGGER COUCHES FOR YOU SUFFERERS
OUT OF SUCH SEED HOWEVER--IS TRUTH PRODUCED
YOUR POVERTY YE MEN AND YOUR SORDIDNESS OF SOUL
MY FRIENDS ALL OF YOU SAID THE UGLIEST MAN WHAT THINK YE
EVERYTHING BREAKETH EVERYTHING IS INTEGRATED ANEW
HATH HE NOT CREATED THE WORLD IN HIS OWN IMAGE NAMELY AS STUPID AS POSSIBLE
EVEN THE SUN IS COMMON TO US
AND WHEN I OFFERED MY HOLIEST AS A SACRIFICE IMMEDIATELY DID YOUR PIETY PUT ITS FATTER GIFTS BESIDE IT
ART THOU NOT THYSELF THE WIND WITH SHRILL WHISTLING WHICH BURSTETH OPEN THE GATES OF THE FORTRESS OF DEATH
HE ASSUMES THAT CHRISTIANITY AS A PRODUCT OF THE RESENTMENT OF THE BOTCHED AND THE WEAK HAS PUT IN BAN ALL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL STRONG PROUD AND POWERFUL IN FACT ALL THE QUALITIES RESULTING FROM STRENGTH AND THAT IN CONSEQUENCE ALL FORCES WHICH TEND TO PROMOTE OR ELEVATE LIFE HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY UNDERMINED
I DO NOT PRAISE THE LAND WHERE BUTTER AND HONEY--FLOW
O HUMAN HUBBUB THOU WONDERFUL THING
SERPENTS FILTH AND EVIL ODOUR THE DISTANCE CONCEALED FROM ME
AND DID I NOT MYSELF WARN YOU AGAINST IT WHEN I SAID THAT IT WAS A DECEIVER A LYING AND DECEIVING SPIRIT
VERILY AN APPROPRIATOR OF ALL VALUES MUST SUCH BESTOWING LOVE BECOME
BUT THAT I COLLAPSE--THIS MY COLLAPSING IS GENUINE IT HONOURETH THEE SAID ZARATHUSTRA GLOOMILY LOOKING DOWN WITH SIDELONG GLANCE IT HONOURETH THEE THAT THOU SOUGHTEST FOR GREATNESS BUT IT BETRAYETH THEE ALSO
AND THIS IS THE DISCOURSE THAT ZARATHUSTRA SPAKE WHEN HE AWOKE
AND WHEN DOTH THIS TAKE PLACE
WITH THE STORM THAT IS CALLED SPIRIT DID I BLOW OVER THY SURGING SEA
THY GRACIOUSNESS AND OVER-GRACIOUSNESS IS IT WHICH WILL NOT COMPLAIN AND WEEP
THERE IS A CERTAIN SELF-RESPECT IN THE SERIOUS MAN WHICH MAKES HIM HOLD HIS PROFOUNDEST FEELINGS SACRED
THE WORLD ITSELF IS A FILTHY MONSTER FOR THESE ARE ALL UNCLEAN SPIRITS
DID MY WISDOM PERHAPS SPEAK SECRETLY TO IT MY LAUGHING WIDE-AWAKE DAY-WISDOM WHICH MOCKETH AT ALL INFINITE WORLDS
FOR IN THE EVENING WE WANT BOTH TO BE IN GOOD SPIRITS
BE ASHAMED OF HIM
I AM CRUEL THOU BLEEDEST
YEA IT CONSTRAINETH ME SO THAT MY SOUL STRETCHETH ITSELF OUT HOW LONG AND WEARY IT BECOMETH MY STRANGE SOUL
ANSWERED ZARATHUSTRA
I--AM THE TRUTH HATH AN IMMODEST ONE EVER BEEN ANSWERED MORE COURTEOUSLY?--THOU HOWEVER O ZARATHUSTRA PASSEDST HIM BY AND SAIDST
IN THEM SO PROFOUND IS THE DEPTH THAT EVEN THE CLEAREST WATER DOTH NOT--BETRAY IT THOU SNOW-BEARDED SILENT WINTER-SKY THOU ROUND-EYED WHITEHEAD ABOVE ME
THUS HAVE I ALREADY TAUGHT
DO GO OUT OF THE WAY OF THE BAD ODOUR
DO GO OUT OF THE WAY OF THE BAD ODOUR
THE STROKE HE STRUCK BEWITCHED HIS WEAK REASON
SO WE ARE OBLIGED TO LIE
HE THAT SPAKE WAS THE BUFFOON FROM THE TOWER
IT IS TIME
IT IS TIME
IN THE CASE OF CHRISTIANITY THIS TYPE WAS ACCORDING TO NIETZSCHE A LOW ONE
SO AWAY WITH THEM
HOW BLESSEDLY AND TENDERLY SPEAKETH THY VOICE UNTO ME
AND NOT ONLY THE ROSY DAWN PASSED OVER HIS HEAD BUT ALSO THE MORNING
LXVIII
SHOULDST THOU HOWEVER FIND HONEY THEREIN WELL
FOR IT SEEKETH--TO CREATE WHAT IS LOVED
TO THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY WILL I SPEAK A WORD
WHY DOST THOU CONCEAL THYSELF HE CRIES
THEY MAKE LIFE ENDURABLE THEY ARE OF ASSISTANCE IN THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE WHICH IS THE MOTIVE FORCE BEHIND THE PEOPLE PRACTISING THIS MORALITY
SO WILL I HAVE IT
WHAT LIFE PROMISETH US THAT PROMISE WILL WE KEEP--TO LIFE ONE SHOULD NOT WISH TO ENJOY WHERE ONE DOTH NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE ENJOYMENT
VERILY YE COULD WEAR NO BETTER MASKS YE PRESENT-DAY MEN THAN YOUR OWN FACES
HATH THE WILL BECOME ITS OWN DELIVERER AND JOY-BRINGER
GOOD MEN NEVER SPEAK THE TRUTH
HOW MUCH OF RANSOM-GOLD
THEY ALL PREACH SUBMISSION AND HUMILITY AND POLICY AND DILIGENCE AND CONSIDERATION AND THE LONG ET CETERA OF PETTY VIRTUES
ZARATHUSTRA'S APE HE IS CALLED IN THE DISCOURSE
NOW INDEED DO I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE ONCE TAUGHT US
STILL MORE REPUGNANT UNTO ME HOWEVER ARE ALL LICKSPITTLES
I SEE MANY SOLDIERS
ZARATHUSTRA RECOGNISES ANOTHER HIGHER MAN IN THE EX-POPE AND SENDS HIM TOO AS A GUEST TO THE CAVE
AH WE WERE MADE TO REMAIN NIGH UNTO EACH OTHER YE KINDLY STRANGE MARVELS
THOU SEDUCEST THOU FALSE ONE THOU SUBTLE ONE TO UNKNOWN DESIRES AND DESERTS
THIS NEW TABLE O MY BRETHREN PUT I UP OVER YOU
THAT CHARGE THEY HEAVILY TO THINE ACCOUNT
AND EVER DOTH IT PROWL ROUND THE TABLES OF BESTOWERS
BESIDE THE WELL LIETH HE QUIETLY WITH CLOSED EYES
FORGIVE ME AN OLD AFTER-DINNER SONG WHICH I ONCE COMPOSED AMONGST DAUGHTERS OF THE DESERT FOR WITH THEM WAS THERE EQUALLY GOOD CLEAR ORIENTAL AIR
MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO
SO MUCH LESS DOTH LIFE BIND ME WERE THEY CONSISTENTLY PITIFUL THEN WOULD THEY MAKE THEIR NEIGHBOURS SICK OF LIFE
IN AND DOWN THOU BAIT OF MY HAPPINESS
YE HIGHER MEN HERE HAVE YE NOT ALL--BEEN FAILURES
AND THOUGH YE BE HIGH AND OF A HIGHER TYPE MUCH IN YOU IS CROOKED AND MISSHAPEN
THEREFORE DID I ASCEND INTO THESE MOUNTAINS THAT I MIGHT FINALLY HAVE A FESTIVAL FOR MYSELF ONCE MORE AS BECOMETH AN OLD POPE AND CHURCH-FATHER
THE STATE I CALL IT WHERE ALL ARE POISON-DRINKERS THE GOOD AND THE BAD
EAT AND DRINK ALSO WITH ME TO-DAY AND FORGIVE IT THAT A CHEERFUL OLD MAN SITTETH WITH THEE AT TABLE!"--"A CHEERFUL OLD MAN ANSWERED THE SOOTHSAYER SHAKING HIS HEAD BUT WHOEVER THOU ART OR WOULDST BE O ZARATHUSTRA THOU HAST BEEN HERE ALOFT THE LONGEST TIME,--IN A LITTLE WHILE THY BARK SHALL NO LONGER REST ON DRY LAND!"--"DO I THEN REST ON DRY LAND?"--ASKED ZARATHUSTRA LAUGHING.--"THE WAVES AROUND THY MOUNTAIN ANSWERED THE SOOTHSAYER RISE AND RISE THE WAVES OF GREAT DISTRESS AND AFFLICTION
FOR LO IT IS ALSO A SERMON FOR SLAVERY BECAUSE THEY LEARNED BADLY AND NOT THE BEST AND EVERYTHING TOO EARLY AND EVERYTHING TOO FAST
THUS DOTH THE MASTER GIVE FREE SCOPE TO HIS SLAVES AND EVEN ENJOYETH THEIR PRESUMPTUOUSNESS
NEITHER IS ZARATHUSTRA INDIGNANT AT A CONVALESCENT WHO LOOKETH TENDERLY ON HIS DELUSIONS AND AT MIDNIGHT STEALETH ROUND THE GRAVE OF HIS GOD
MANY AN INDESCRIBABLE THING HATH THERE BEEN DONE
HE IS A POWER THAT CAN BE PICTURED AND ENDURED ONLY BY A HARDY AND COURAGEOUS RACE A RACE RICH ENOUGH TO SACRIFICE AND TO LOSE IN SACRIFICE
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS WANTETH THE TRUE MAN
WHO WOULD STILL HOLD ON TO GOOD AND EVIL
THE PERFECT TEACHETH ONE TO HOPE
DO I ADVISE YOU TO NEIGHBOUR-LOVE
AND WHAT YE HAVE CALLED THE WORLD SHALL BUT BE CREATED BY YOU
TO THE RABBLE THE SLOW FIRE AT WHICH IT IS BURNT
TO THE EXALTED THE SOUL BECOMETH JOYFUL
AND I PRESSED THE KEY AND PULLED AT THE GATE AND EXERTED MYSELF
BUT HE DOES NOT DO SO LONG
THAT I HAVE TO SING ONCE MORE--THAT CONSOLATION DID I DEVISE FOR MYSELF AND THIS CONVALESCENCE
WHAT HIDDEN WISDOM IT IS TO WEAR LONG EARS AND ONLY TO SAY YEA AND NEVER NAY
THEIR WARM BREATH TOUCHETH MY SOUL WHEN HOWEVER HE SPIED ABOUT AND SOUGHT FOR THE COMFORTERS OF HIS LONESOMENESS BEHOLD THERE WERE KINE THERE STANDING TOGETHER ON AN EMINENCE WHOSE PROXIMITY AND SMELL HAD WARMED HIS HEART
GIVE LOVE TO ME--WHO WARM'TH ME STILL
AND WITH SOME OF YOU THERE IS HATRED AT FIRST SIGHT
O MY BRETHREN ARE YE ALSO EVIL ENOUGH FOR THIS TRUTH
THEY DIRECTLY ABUT ON ONE ANOTHER:--AND IT IS HERE AT THIS GATEWAY THAT THEY COME TOGETHER
SO TO-DAY THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE AMONG OPINIONS AND VALUES IS SO GREAT THAT AN ART-FORM IS PRACTICALLY THE ONLY GARB IN WHICH A NEW PHILOSOPHY CAN DARE TO INTRODUCE ITSELF TO US
I CARRY THEE THITHER
THERE THEY WANT TO GET THEIR PREY
BUT THE SAME WAVE SHALL BRING THEM NEW PLAYTHINGS AND SPREAD BEFORE THEM NEW SPECKLED SHELLS
THEY TALK MUCH OF DIGNITY AND VIRTUE--THEIR DRAG THEY CALL VIRTUE
SOME OF THEM WILL BUT MOST OF THEM ARE WILLED
AND WHEN I PERFORMED MY HARDEST TASK AND CELEBRATED THE TRIUMPH OF MY VICTORIES THEN DID YE MAKE THOSE WHO LOVED ME CALL OUT THAT I THEN GRIEVED THEM MOST
AND THE SPIRIT'S HAPPINESS IS THIS
AH HOW GREAT MUST THAT SELF-LOVE BE
THERE IS MORE SAGACITY IN THY BODY THAN IN THY BEST WISDOM
OH THIS IS THE HOSTILITY OF LIGHT TO THE SHINING ONE
XXXI
XXXI
WORLD-WEARY ONES
FOR RATHER WILL I HAVE NOISE AND THUNDERS AND TEMPEST-BLASTS THAN THIS DISCREET DOUBTING CAT-REPOSE
OUT OF COLOURS YE SEEM TO BE BAKED AND OUT OF GLUED SCRAPS
GO 10
BUT THIS WORD WILL I SAY UNTO MINE ENEMIES
SPEAK AND SUCCUMB WHEN IT DISGUSTED THEE WITH ALL THY WAITING AND SILENCE AND DISCOURAGED THY HUMBLE COURAGE
LVIII
LVIII
SO THAT HE CURSETH HIM WHO HEALED HIM
AND IMMEDIATELY HE FELL ASLEEP TIRED IN BODY BUT WITH A TRANQUIL SOUL
THAT IS THE FIRST THING
FOR HE SAW A NEW TRUTH
TAKE THE CHILDREN AWAY CRIED SHE SUCH EYES SCORCH CHILDREN'S SOULS THEY COUGH WHEN I SPEAK
AND ONE OF THEM SAID EVEN
THEN HOWEVER HE THOUGHT OF HIS ABANDONED FRIENDS--AND AS IF HE HAD DONE THEM A WRONG WITH HIS THOUGHTS HE UPBRAIDED HIMSELF BECAUSE OF HIS THOUGHTS
IS SHE BEAUTIFUL
AYE FOR THE GAME OF CREATING MY BRETHREN THERE IS NEEDED A HOLY YEA UNTO LIFE
UNTO MY CHILDREN WILL I MAKE AMENDS FOR BEING THE CHILD OF MY FATHERS
THEN WILL THY SOUL THRILL WITH DIVINE DESIRES
CHAPTER LXI
THEY THEREFORE REQUIRE NEW FESTIVALS,--"A LITTLE VALIANT NONSENSE SOME DIVINE SERVICE AND ASS-FESTIVAL SOME OLD JOYFUL ZARATHUSTRA FOOL SOME BLUSTERER TO BLOW THEIR SOULS BRIGHT HE TELLS THEM NOT TO FORGET THAT NIGHT AND THE ASS-FESTIVAL FOR SUCH THINGS ONLY THE CONVALESCENT DEVISE
SOMETIMES WITH THE RESULT THAT IT LOSES ALL AIMS ALL HOPES AND ALL TRUST IN A DEFINITE GOAL
THUS SPEAKETH THE DISCERNING ONE
THE STATE WHERE THE SLOW SUICIDE OF ALL--IS CALLED LIFE JUST SEE THESE SUPERFLUOUS ONES
EVEN AT PRESENT TO BE SURE THERE ARE SOME LIKE THIS PREACHER OF VIRTUE AND NOT ALWAYS SO HONOURABLE
OBTRUSIVENESS IS THEIR PRAISE
OR SHOW YOU RESTLESS MISWANDERING MISCLIMBING ONES NEW AND EASIER FOOTPATHS
THE THREE EVIL THINGS
THE THREE EVIL THINGS
THE THREE EVIL THINGS
CHAPTER IV
HIGHER STILL THAN LOVE TO MEN IS LOVE TO THINGS AND PHANTOMS
AS ITS HOLIEST IT ONCE LOVED THOU-SHALT
FROM THE FIGHT WITH WILD BEASTS RETURNED HE HOME
FORSOOTH THERE IS A LAKE IN ME SEQUESTERED AND SELF-SUFFICING
IT WAS
BUT ALL AT ONCE HE BECAME THE HANDMAID OF A WOMAN AND NOW WOULD HE NEED ALSO TO BECOME AN ANGEL
THOU LOVEST THYSELF AND ON THAT ACCOUNT DESPISEST THOU THYSELF AS ONLY THE LOVING ONES DESPISE
PURE IS HIS EYE AND NO LOATHING LURKETH ABOUT HIS MOUTH
EVERYTHING IS FALSE AND FOUL WITH US
YEA EVEN WHEN IT COMMANDETH ITSELF THEN ALSO MUST IT ATONE FOR ITS COMMANDING
THEN THE PEOPLE DISPERSED FOR EVEN CURIOSITY AND TERROR BECOME FATIGUED
FALSE VALUES AND FATUOUS WORDS
O MY BRETHREN INTO THE HEARTS OF THE GOOD AND JUST LOOKED SOME ONE ONCE ON A TIME WHO SAID
THAT WHOEVER PRICKETH UP HIS EARS WHEN LYING IN THE GRASS OR ON LONELY SLOPES LEARNETH SOMETHING OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BETWIXT HEAVEN AND EARTH
HE HOWEVER WHO WHITEWASHETH HIS HOUSE BETRAYETH UNTO ME A WHITEWASHED SOUL
OR DOTH THE ANIMAL SPEAK IN THY WISH AND NECESSITY
UPRIGHTLY AND OPENLY MAYEST THOU HERE TALK TO ALL THINGS
DROWSILY AND STRANGELY DOTH ITS EYE GAZE UPON ME
BEASTS OF PREY ARE THEY
THERE IS TOO MUCH FOREGROUND IN ALL MEN--WHAT CAN FAR-SEEING FAR-LONGING EYES DO THERE
BUT PROVE THAT HE HATH DONE SOMETHING GOOD TO YOU
AS THOU DOEST IN THE EVENING WHEN THOU GOEST BEHIND THE SEA AND GIVEST LIGHT ALSO TO THE NETHER-WORLD THOU EXUBERANT STAR
FELLOW-CREATORS ZARATHUSTRA SEEKETH
OUR OLD GUARDIANS THE GODS AND DEMI-GODS OF OUR YOUTH THE SUPERSTITIONS AND FEARS OF OUR CHILDHOOD WITHDRAW
PART IV
THESE MEDIATORS AND MIXERS WE DETEST--THE PASSING CLOUDS
MAN SHALL BE TRAINED FOR WAR AND WOMAN FOR THE RECREATION OF THE WARRIOR
YE LOOK ALOFT WHEN YE LONG FOR EXALTATION
THOU THINKEST THYSELF WISE THOU PROUD ZARATHUSTRA
THEN HE SIGHED AND SPAKE THUS TO HIS HEART
BUT PRECISELY TO THE HERO IS BEAUTY THE HARDEST THING OF ALL
IN FEAR PERHAPS BEFORE A FURIOUS YELLOW BLOND AND CURLED LEONINE MONSTER
COURAGE HOWEVER AND ADVENTURE AND DELIGHT IN THE UNCERTAIN IN THE UNATTEMPTED--COURAGE SEEMETH TO ME THE ENTIRE PRIMITIVE HISTORY OF MAN
AND IF THE FAULT LAY IN OUR EARS WHY DID HE GIVE US EARS THAT HEARD HIM BADLY
AND WITH MOUNTAINS SHALL THE DISCERNING ONE LEARN TO BUILD
IN YOUR DYING SHALL YOUR SPIRIT AND YOUR VIRTUE STILL SHINE LIKE AN EVENING AFTER-GLOW AROUND THE EARTH
AND THAT IS THE FOOLISHEST THING IN LIFE LIFE IS ONLY SUFFERING
IS THIS TO-DAY NOT THAT OF THE POPULACE
I DANCE AFTER THEE I FOLLOW EVEN FAINT TRACES LONELY
WHO WILL PUT A FETTER UPON THE THOUSAND NECKS OF THIS ANIMAL
THEY ARE CONVALESCENTS THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA JOYFULLY TO HIS HEART AND GAZED OUTWARD
AND THERE WILL BE ADORATION EVEN IN THY VANITY
AND THE SUN OF HIS KNOWLEDGE WILL BE AT NOONTIDE
YE HIGHER MEN LEARN I PRAY YOU--TO LAUGH
OR WHY DIDST THOU NOT TILL THE GROUND
WHAT CHILD HATH NOT HAD REASON TO WEEP OVER ITS PARENTS
BUT WHAT IS THAT CALLED WHICH STILL PUTTETH THE EMANCIPATOR IN CHAINS
THOU NOISE IN DARK STREETS
THE FLIES IN THE MARKET-PLACE
THE FLIES IN THE MARKET-PLACE
THUS TO DIE IS BEST
THIS SEEKING FOR MY HOME
THOU HAST BECOME THE ENCHANTER OF ALL THE WORLD
VOLUPTUOUSNESS:--BUT I WILL HAVE HEDGES AROUND MY THOUGHTS AND EVEN AROUND MY WORDS LEST SWINE AND LIBERTINE SHOULD BREAK INTO MY GARDENS PASSION FOR POWER
THE WHEEL OF CAUSALITY DOTH NOT ROLL BETWEEN THEM
A WORTHY BEGINNING
THIS IS MY SORROW
ZARATHUSTRA ABJURES ALL THOSE WHO WOULD FAIN TURN AN IMPERSONAL EYE UPON NATURE AND CONTEMPLATE HER PHENOMENA WITH THAT PURE OBJECTIVITY TO WHICH THE SCIENTIFIC IDEALISTS OF TO-DAY WOULD SO MUCH LIKE TO ATTAIN
WHO ART THOU ASKED HE AND GAVE HIM HIS HAND THERE IS MUCH TO CLEAR UP AND ELUCIDATE BETWEEN US BUT ALREADY METHINKETH PURE CLEAR DAY IS DAWNING I AM THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE ANSWERED HE WHO WAS ASKED AND IN MATTERS OF THE SPIRIT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ANY ONE TO TAKE IT MORE RIGOROUSLY MORE RESTRICTEDLY AND MORE SEVERELY THAN I EXCEPT HIM FROM WHOM I LEARNT IT ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF
AND THOUGH I HID MYSELF FROM THEE I WAS NEVERTHELESS THY BEST SHADOW
SULTRY HEART AND COLD HEAD
YEA THOU SUBLIME ONE ONE DAY SHALT THOU ALSO BE BEAUTIFUL AND HOLD UP THE MIRROR TO THINE OWN BEAUTY
BUT NOW LEARN THIS LIKEWISE
NOW KNOW I WELL WHAT PEOPLE SOUGHT FORMERLY ABOVE ALL ELSE WHEN THEY SOUGHT TEACHERS OF VIRTUE
NOW ONLY COMETH THE GREAT NOONTIDE NOW ONLY DOTH THE HIGHER MAN BECOME--MASTER
THEY COME AND HOLD OUT THE HAND AND LAUGH AND FLEE--AND RETURN
ZARATHUSTRA'S DISCOURSES
ZARATHUSTRA'S DISCOURSES
ZARATHUSTRA'S DISCOURSES
THOU FEELEST FOR MY HAPPINESS
IN THE WILDERNESS HAVE EVER DWELT THE CONSCIENTIOUS THE FREE SPIRITS AS LORDS OF THE WILDERNESS
ONLY A SPAN-BREADTH IS HE FROM HIS GOAL
THREE TIMES NAY EXCLAIMED HE WITH A STRONG VOICE AND STROKED HIS BEARD--"THAT DO I KNOW BETTER
THIS IS THE WISE WAGGISH-WILL AND GOOD-WILL OF MY SOUL THAT IT CONCEALETH NOT ITS WINTERS AND GLACIAL STORMS
I WAIT FOR HIGHER ONES STRONGER ONES MORE TRIUMPHANT ONES MERRIER ONES FOR SUCH AS ARE BUILT SQUARELY IN BODY AND SOUL HE SAYS IN PAR
THAT THEY SPEAK IN FAVOUR OF LIFE THOUGH THEY SIT IN THEIR DEN THESE POISON-SPIDERS AND WITHDRAWN FROM LIFE--IS BECAUSE THEY WOULD THEREBY DO INJURY
OH WEEP YE NOT GENTLE SPIRITS
ALL GOOD THINGS LAUGH HE SAYS AND HIS FINAL COMMAND TO THE HIGHER MEN IS LEARN I PRAY YOU--TO LAUGH ALL THAT IS GOOD IN NIETZSCHE'S SENSE IS CHEERFUL
THAT THE SEXES ARE AT BOTTOM ANTAGONISTIC--THAT IS TO SAY AS DIFFERENT AS BLUE IS FROM YELLOW AND THAT THE BEST POSSIBLE MEANS OF REARING ANYTHING APPROACHING A DESIRABLE RACE IS TO PRESERVE AND TO FOSTER THIS PROFOUND HOSTILITY
AND WHENEVER A DOVE WHISKED OVER ITS NOSE THE LION SHOOK ITS HEAD AND WONDERED AND LAUGHED
HEARKEN RATHER MY BRETHREN TO THE VOICE OF THE HEALTHY BODY
WHAT PERSUADETH THE LIVING THING TO OBEY AND COMMAND AND EVEN BE OBEDIENT IN COMMANDING
SO THAT SOME LAUGHED AND SOME WEPT
FOR IN ITS DEPTHS SIGHETH HIS HEART
THEN LEARN FIRST OF ALL TO LOVE
MINE EAGLE IS AWAKE AND LIKE ME HONOURETH THE SUN
THAT YOUR VIRTUE IS YOUR SELF AND NOT AN OUTWARD THING A SKIN OR A CLOAK
HIS DEED ITSELF IS STILL THE SHADOW UPON HIM
I CHANGE TOO QUICKLY
WHAT IS CHASTITY
AND LATE ONLY WILL JUSTICE LIMP AFTER THEE
SOUR APPLES ARE THERE NO DOUBT WHOSE LOT IS TO WAIT UNTIL THE LAST DAY OF AUTUMN
FOR THIS IS HARDEST OF ALL
IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THE PROLOGUE VERSE 7 ZARATHUSTRA GIVES US A FORETASTE OF HIS TEACHING CONCERNING THE BIG AND THE LITTLE SAGACITIES EXPOUNDED SUBSEQUENTLY
FOR THEY GO BEYOND 7
FROM THE SUN DID I LEARN THIS WHEN IT GOETH DOWN THE EXUBERANT ONE
I ZARATHUSTRA THE ADVOCATE OF LIVING THE ADVOCATE OF SUFFERING THE ADVOCATE OF THE CIRCUIT--THEE DO I CALL MY MOST ABYSMAL THOUGHT
IN THE FOLLOWING WINTER AFTER WANDERING SOMEWHAT ERRATICALLY THROUGH STRESA GENOA AND SPEZIA HE LANDED IN NICE WHERE THE CLIMATE SO HAPPILY PROMOTED HIS CREATIVE POWERS THAT HE WROTE THE THIRD PART OF ZARATHUSTRA IN THE WINTER BENEATH THE HALCYON SKY OF NICE WHICH THEN LOOKED DOWN UPON ME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I FOUND THE THIRD ZARATHUSTRA'--AND CAME TO THE END OF MY TASK
IT WAS THE BODY WHICH DESPAIRED OF THE BODY--IT GROPED WITH THE FINGERS OF THE INFATUATED SPIRIT AT THE ULTIMATE WALLS
HAVE YE DIVINED WHAT IT WOULD SAY
A SMALL MATTER IF THE ROUGH WAVE FOAMETH AND ANGRILY RESISTETH ITS KEEL
THEY WANT TO BE CLOSE TO THY SKIN AND THY BLOOD
O BLESSED HOUR OF THE LIGHTNING
ZARATHUSTRA STEPS ON HIM UNAWARES AND THE SLAVE OF SCIENCE BLEEDING FROM THE VIOLENCE HE HAS DONE TO HIMSELF BY HIS SELF-IMPOSED TASK SPEAKS PROUDLY OF HIS LITTLE SPHERE OF KNOWLEDGE--HIS LITTLE HAND'S BREADTH OF GROUND ON ZARATHUSTRA'S TERRITORY PHILOSOPHY
XVII
XVII
I TRIED TO LEAVE IT
SUCH IS THE LANGUAGE OF ALL FISH SAIDST THOU
STILL THERE REMAINS A HOPE THAT DARWIN AND NIETZSCHE MAY SOME DAY BECOME RECONCILED BY A NEW DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESSES BY WHICH VARIETIES OCCUR
WHO AM I WHEN HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA HAD HEARD THESE WORDS,--WHAT THINK YE THEN TOOK PLACE IN HIS SOUL
ALL TOO LIKE ONE ANOTHER--ALL TOO HUMAN EVEN THE GREATEST MAN
YE HOWEVER WHEN I SEE WHAT EYES YE MAKE IT ALMOST SEEMETH TO ME THAT YE SEEK MORE INSECURITY MORE HORROR MORE DANGER MORE EARTHQUAKE
THE EARTHQUAKE DISCLOSETH NEW FOUNTAINS
AMONGST PEOPLES OF A STRANGE LANGUAGE DID I DWELL WITH STOPPED EARS
OH THOU BAD SEEKER WHY DOST THOU--TEMPT ME THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA COMFORTED IN HIS HEART AND WENT LAUGHING ON HIS WAY
HOW DID MY SOUL RISE AGAIN OUT OF THOSE SEPULCHRES
WHAT DOTH IT NOW MATTER ABOUT KINGS FORGIVE ME
I MYSELF TO BE SURE--I HAVE AS YET SEEN NO GREAT MAN
MANY A THING ALSO THAT IS OUR OWN IS HARD TO BEAR
BUT AS YET DEATH IS NOT A FESTIVAL
NO LONGER CAN YOUR SELF DO THAT WHICH IT DESIRETH MOST:--CREATE BEYOND ITSELF
KNOW YE THE DELIGHT WHICH ROLLETH STONES INTO PRECIPITOUS DEPTHS?--THOSE MEN OF TO-DAY SEE JUST HOW THEY ROLL INTO MY DEPTHS
HOW MUCH IS STILL POSSIBLE
LXXIV
LXXIV
THEY CAME FROM SUCH OLD SORROWFUL ARID NIGHT-WATCHMEN
WHAT WILT THOU DO IN THE LAND OF THE SLEEPERS
YE ALMOST SEEM TO ME TO RESEMBLE THOSE WHO HAVE LONG LOOKED AT BAD GIRLS DANCING NAKED
SUCH SAYINGS DID I HEAR PIOUS BACKWORLDSMEN SPEAK TO THEIR CONSCIENCES AND VERILY WITHOUT WICKEDNESS OR GUILE,--ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOTHING MORE GUILEFUL IN THE WORLD OR MORE WICKED
WHAT WILT THOU UNFAMILIAR--GOD
HE WHO WANTETH TO KILL MOST THOROUGHLY LAUGHETH
ALL LIFE HAD I RENOUNCED SO I DREAMED
YOUR VERY VIRTUE WISHETH YOU TO HAVE NAUGHT TO DO WITH FOR AND ON ACCOUNT OF AND BECAUSE AGAINST THESE FALSE LITTLE WORDS SHALL YE STOP YOUR EARS
AND ALL WHO WERE PRESENT WENT LIKE BIRDS UNAWARES INTO THE NET OF HIS ARTFUL AND MELANCHOLY VOLUPTUOUSNESS
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER SPAKE THESE WORDS
DO NOT SING THOU PRAIRIE-BIRD MY SOUL
WINE HATH BECOME LEES EVERY CUP HATH BECOME BRITTLE THE SEPULCHRES MUTTER
METHINKETH HE IS OF THE TYPE OF THE PRIESTS
WITH COMFORT HOWEVER MODERATE VIRTUE ONLY IS COMPATIBLE
AND THERE WILL I NOT RESIDE AND ABIDE WHERE EVERY ONE SPITTETH AND SPEWETH
IT IS A GREAT MATTER ALWAYS TO BE TWAIN THUS DO I COUNSEL ALL HONEST ONES
LVI
LVI
SEES HEIGHT IN HIS SELF-CONTEMPT AND INVITES HIM TO JOIN THE OTHER HIGHER MEN IN THE CAVE
AND BECAUSE IN THE WILLER HIMSELF THERE IS SUFFERING BECAUSE HE CANNOT WILL BACKWARDS--THUS WAS WILLING ITSELF AND ALL LIFE CLAIMED--TO BE PENALTY
IF EVER I HAVE SPREAD OUT A TRANQUIL HEAVEN ABOVE ME AND HAVE FLOWN INTO MINE OWN HEAVEN WITH MINE OWN PINIONS
HOW CAN I HELP IT IF POWER LIKE TO WALK ON CROOKED LEGS
MANY THINGS IN YOUR GOOD PEOPLE CAUSE ME DISGUST AND VERILY NOT THEIR EVIL
IN VERSE 26 WE ARE VIVIDLY REMINDED OF HERBERT SPENCER'S WORDS LE MARIAGE DE CONVENANCE IS LEGALISED PROSTITUTION CHAPTER LXIX
YE SHALL BECOME PROCREATORS AND CULTIVATORS AND SOWERS OF THE FUTURE VERILY NOT TO A NOBILITY WHICH YE COULD PURCHASE LIKE TRADERS WITH TRADERS GOLD
THAT WAS FORSAKENNESS O LONESOMENESS
SOME DAY HOWEVER WILL GREATER DRAGONS COME INTO THE WORLD
THROUGH VALUATION ONLY IS THERE VALUE
HE SEEKETH TO CAUSE PAIN WITH THAT WHICH CAUSETH HIM PAIN
THAT HE SAW HOW MAN HUNG ON THE CROSS AND COULD NOT ENDURE IT;--THAT HIS LOVE TO MAN BECAME HIS HELL AND AT LAST HIS DEATH THE OLD POPE HOWEVER DID NOT ANSWER BUT LOOKED ASIDE TIMIDLY WITH A PAINFUL AND GLOOMY EXPRESSION
THEN DID YE CAST FILTH ON THE BLIND ONE'S COURSE
IN THE TRUE MAN THERE IS A CHILD HIDDEN
WHERE COULD FUTURE AND PAST BE CLOSER TOGETHER THAN WITH THEE
FOR NOT MYSELF DID I SEE THEREIN BUT A DEVIL'S GRIMACE AND DERISION
IMBIBE NOW THEIR JUICE AND THEIR SWEET SUBSTANCE
YE HAVE STILL CHAOS IN YOU
THE TITLE SUGGESTS ALL KINDS OF MYSTERIES
FOR NO SOCIETY AT ALL SPOILETH ALSO GOOD MANNERS GOOD MANNERS REPLIED ANGRILY AND BITTERLY THE OTHER KING
THE NEXT BEST HOWEVER IS TO DIE IN BATTLE AND SACRIFICE A GREAT SOUL
AND IF ALL LADDERS HENCEFORTH FAIL THEE THEN MUST THOU LEARN TO MOUNT UPON THINE OWN HEAD
HUMAN FATHERS DO THIS BETTER HE IS TOO OLD
BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BE A SWORDSMAN,--ONE MUST ALSO KNOW WHEREON TO USE SWORDSMANSHIP
IT IS NOT THE RIVER THAT IS YOUR DANGER AND THE END OF YOUR GOOD AND EVIL YE WISEST ONES
THE UGLIEST MAN HOWEVER HAD SET A CROWN ON HIS HEAD AND HAD PUT ROUND HIM TWO PURPLE GIRDLES,--FOR HE LIKED LIKE ALL UGLY ONES TO DISGUISE HIMSELF AND PLAY THE HANDSOME PERSON
LXXIII
TO SUCCUMB--SO WISHETH YOUR SELF
AND LIKE THE CAMEL WHICH WHEN LADEN HASTENETH INTO THE WILDERNESS SO HASTENETH THE SPIRIT INTO ITS WILDERNESS
HEARKEN ELSE I WILL SCOURGE YOU WITH THE SCOURGE OF GOD NOT THAT I WOULD HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST SUCH WRATHFUL ONES ON THAT ACCOUNT
AM I UNDERSTOOD
THOUGHTS THAT COME WITH DOVES FOOTSTEPS GUIDE THE WORLD
THEN DID YE LEAD AN OWL-MONSTER ACROSS MY PATH AN ADVERSE SIGN
O MINE ANIMALS ARE YE ALSO CRUEL
ALL THAT IS TERRIBLE AND GREAT IN NATURE THE HIGHER MEN ARE NOT YET PREPARED FOR
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THOU HAST DISCOVERED MY SOUL ZARATHUSTRA SMILED AND SAID
BUT WHERE ARE MINE ANIMALS
THUS DID THEY DEAFEN THE SOUND OF MY TREAD
WE ARE RECOGNISED
FOR THEY ARE MODERATE ALSO IN VIRTUE,--BECAUSE THEY WANT COMFORT
OR ELSE SHOULD THERE PERHAPS SOMETHING STRENGTHENING HEART-STRENGTHENING HERE MOST PROPER BE
GOLD-LUSTRE MAKETH PEACE BETWEEN MOON AND SUN
BUT HOW CAN I HELP IT
SO DOETH ALL WISDOM WHICH SHALL ONE DAY BEAR LIGHTNINGS UNTO THESE MEN OF TO-DAY WILL I NOT BE LIGHT NOR BE CALLED LIGHT
AND WHEN I SPAKE UNTO ALL I SPAKE UNTO NONE
INVOLUNTARY BLISS
INVOLUNTARY BLISS
INVOLUNTARY BLISS
MY VOICE SHALL SOON CROW THEE AWAKE
LAUGHING HAVE I CONSECRATED
HE MANIFESTS THE ONLY CORRECT FEELINGS THAT CAN BE MANIFESTED IN THE PRESENCE OF ANY GREAT MISERY--THAT IS TO SAY SHAME REVERENCE EMBARRASSMENT
AND YE TELL ME FRIENDS THAT THERE IS TO BE NO DISPUTE ABOUT TASTE AND TASTING
FOR HE GRASPED THEREBY UNAWARES INTO A MASS OF THICK WARM SHAGGY HAIR
OR A PLOUGHSHARE
THOU AMIABLE ONE SAID ZARATHUSTRA AND RESTRAINED HIS AFFECTION SPEAK TO ME FIRSTLY OF THYSELF
THUS DO I SPEAK UNTO YOU IN PARABLE YE WHO MAKE THE SOUL GIDDY YE PREACHERS OF EQUALITY
THE SECOND THING HOWEVER IS MY LITTLE FINGER
AND MANY A ONE BECOMETH TRANSPARENT TO US BUT STILL WE CAN BY NO MEANS PENETRATE HIM
CHAPTER XXXIX
DOTH NOT--MAN'S FUTURE STRIVE AND STRUGGLE IN YOU
THOU BAD OLD MAGICIAN THAT IS THE BEST AND THE HONESTEST THING I HONOUR IN THEE THAT THOU HAST BECOME WEARY OF THYSELF AND HAST EXPRESSED IT
BASER STILL IT REGARDETH THE OBSEQUIOUS DOGGISH ONE WHO IMMEDIATELY LIETH ON HIS BACK THE SUBMISSIVE ONE
WE HAVE ENOUGH OF WINE,--A WHOLE ASS-LOAD OF IT
I TRUST MYSELF NO LONGER SINCE I SOUGHT TO RISE INTO THE HEIGHT AND NOBODY TRUSTETH ME ANY LONGER
IN A SMALL MOUNTAIN RESORT RECOARO NEAR VICENZA WHERE I SPENT THE SPRING OF 1881 I AND MY FRIEND AND MAESTRO PETER GAST--ALSO ONE WHO HAD BEEN BORN AGAIN--DISCOVERED THAT THE PHOENIX MUSIC THAT HOVERED OVER US WORE LIGHTER AND BRIGHTER PLUMES THAN IT HAD DONE THERETOFORE DURING THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1881 MY BROTHER RESOLVED TO REVEAL THE TEACHING OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN DITHYRAMBIC AND PSALMODIC FORM THROUGH THE MOUTH OF ZARATHUSTRA
BUT FATE LAY BEHIND IT ALL
ETERNAL MUST ALSO BE ALL PENALTIES THUS DID MADNESS PREACH
ONE MUST LEARN TO LOVE ONESELF--THUS DO I TEACH--WITH A WHOLESOME AND HEALTHY LOVE
WHAT IS ALL MANSLAUGHTER IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT YE HAVE DONE UNTO ME
AND VERILY IT IS A NOBLE DICTUM WHICH SAITH
PERHAPS AT THEIR HOST'S EXPENSE
BEFORE THE POPULACE HOWEVER WE WILL NOT BE EQUAL
THOU HOWEVER,--MUST DECEIVE
AN OLD MAN APPEARED WHO CARRIED A LIGHT AND ASKED
WHEN HOWEVER THEY REACHED THE DOOR OF THE CAVE AND THE NOISE OF THEIR STEPS HAD PRECEDED THEM THE LION STARTED VIOLENTLY
THESE ARE FINE FAR-AWAY THINGS
AND ASK COUNSEL OF MINE ANIMALS MINE EAGLE AND MY SERPENT
NOT BY WRATH BUT BY LAUGHTER DOTH ONE KILL'--THUS SPAKEST THOU ONCE O ZARATHUSTRA THOU HIDDEN ONE THOU DESTROYER WITHOUT WRATH THOU DANGEROUS SAINT,--THOU ART A ROGUE 2
CAN THERE BE DELIVERANCE WHEN THERE IS ETERNAL JUSTICE
FOR ONE NEEDETH WARMTH
BUT STILL LESS COULD YE ENDURE THE SPIRIT'S HUMILITY SHOULD IT EVER WANT TO SPEAK
CHAPTER LXVI
FOR YE CAN NO LONGER CREATE BEYOND YOURSELVES
BETTER SONGS WOULD THEY HAVE TO SING FOR ME TO BELIEVE IN THEIR SAVIOUR
ALSO THE LANES MAKETH HE LONESOME SO THAT THE MOONLIGHT IS AFRAID THERE AT NIGHT
A THOUGHT SUDDENLY FLASHES UP LIKE LIGHTNING IT COMES WITH NECESSITY UNHESITATINGLY--I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY CHOICE IN THE MATTER
EVERY ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE THROWN TO ME HIS ALMS HIS PITY IN LOOK AND SPEECH
AT LAST HOWEVER AFTER MUCH TREMBLING AND CONVULSION AND CURLING-HIMSELF-UP HE BEGAN TO LAMENT THUS
THE REST
THEREBY DID I KNOW THEE AS ZARATHUSTRA
IN THE ASS-FESTIVAL IT SUDDENLY OCCURS TO HIM THAT HE IS CONCERNED WITH A CEREMONY THAT MAY NOT BE WITHOUT ITS PURPOSE AS SOMETHING FOOLISH BUT NECESSARY--A RECREATION FOR WISE MEN
THEREFORE DO I WASH THE HAND THAT HATH HELPED THE SUFFERER
MY DESTRUCTION I LONGED FOR WHEN I DESIRED TO BE ON THE HEIGHT AND THOU ART THE LIGHTNING FOR WHICH I WAITED
YE HIGHER MEN WHAT THINK YE
BUT THE FOLLY CAME UNTO US AND NOT WE UNTO IT
BUT MY HAPPINESS SHOULD JUSTIFY EXISTENCE ITSELF THE HOUR WHEN YE SAY
FLOWETH THERE NOT A TAINTED FROTHY SWAMP-BLOOD IN THINE OWN VEINS WHEN THOU HAST THUS LEARNED TO CROAK AND REVILE
A GREAT LONGING HATH ARISEN AND MANY HAVE LEARNED TO ASK
IS TO-DAY THE TIME FOR IT
A PRAISE SHALL THEY BE AND A JUSTIFICATION OF ALL PERISHABLENESS
THE CREATING SELF CREATED FOR ITSELF ESTEEMING AND DESPISING IT CREATED FOR ITSELF JOY AND WOE
MY FRIENDS
FOR VENGEANCE THOU VAIN FOOL IS ALL THY FOAMING
OH BREAK UP BREAK UP MY HEART AFTER SUCH HAPPINESS AFTER SUCH A STING
OR SHALL I AS THE MASTIFFS DO ROLL ME BEFORE THEE
FOR BEAUTY ALONE SHOULD PREACH PENITENCE
WHAT DID I NOT SURRENDER THAT I MIGHT HAVE ONE THING
NOW DO WE DESIRE--THE SUPERMAN TO LIVE
BECAUSE HE HAD STILL MUCH TO GIVE THEM
ALL THREADING AND KNITTING AND WEAVING DO THEIR FINGERS UNDERSTAND
OR AN EVIL ONE
WAS IT NOT BECAUSE I LOVED MEN FAR TOO WELL
OR A DROP OF DEW
NO ONE SHALL THY JEALOUS SOUL LOVE EXCEPT A FRIEND"--THAT MADE THE SOUL OF A GREEK THRILL
HE ONLY EFFECTETH IT THAT AUGHT IS GOOD OR BAD
IT WERE THE HEIGHT OF PRESUMPTION TO ATTEMPT TO FIX ANY PARTICULAR INTERPRETATION OF MY OWN TO THE WORDS OF THIS SONG
BETTER BEASTS OF PREY SHALL THEY THUS BECOME SUBTLER CLEVERER MORE MAN-LIKE
BUT NOT FOES TO BE DESPISED
AND THIS MEANETH TO ME KNOWLEDGE
NEVER YET DID TRUTH CLING TO THE ARM OF AN ABSOLUTE ONE
TO EVERYTHING CLEANLY AM I WELL DISPOSED
ALL THIS SENTIMENTAL WAILING OVER THE LARGER PROPORTION OF FAILURES THAN SUCCESSES IN HUMAN LIFE DOES NOT SEEM TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT IT IS THE RAREST THING ON EARTH FOR A HIGHLY ORGANISED BEING TO ATTAIN TO THE FULLEST DEVELOPMENT AND ACTIVITY OF ALL ITS FUNCTIONS SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS SO HIGHLY ORGANISED
FOR YE DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME
FOR TO MANY IS MARRIAGE PROMISED AND MORE THAN MARRIAGE TO MANY THAT ARE MORE UNKNOWN TO EACH OTHER THAN MAN AND WOMAN:--AND WHO HATH FULLY UNDERSTOOD HOW UNKNOWN TO EACH OTHER ARE MAN AND WOMAN
COURAGE IS THE BEST SLAYER
JUST SEE ME WALK
FOR THEE IT IS A SHAME TO PRAY
AT LAST HE SPAKE THUS--AND HIS VOICE HAD CHANGED
FOR HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED NIGHT-WALKER AND LIKED TO LOOK INTO THE FACE OF ALL THAT SLEPT
LIII
LIII
THE WORK OF A SUFFERING AND TORTURED GOD DID THE WORLD THEN SEEM TO ME
HIS OWN WORLD WINNETH THE WORLD'S OUTCAST
THEY SMILED AND LOOKED TOWARDS THE SPOT WHENCE THE VOICE PROCEEDED AND AFTERWARDS LOOKED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACES
WHAT MATTER ABOUT THYSELF ZARATHUSTRA
THE YELLOW ONES
AS YET HAVE I NEVER VENTURED TO CALL THEE UP
AH THAT YE WOULD RENOUNCE ALL HALF-WILLING AND WOULD DECIDE FOR IDLENESS AS YE DECIDE FOR ACTION
GOD IS DEAD
GOD IS DEAD
THIS DO WE CALL THE ETERNALLY FEMININE IN US
THERE IS IN THE WORLD MUCH FILTH
UPWARDS:--IN SPITE OF THE SPIRIT THAT DREW IT DOWNWARDS TOWARDS THE ABYSS THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY MY DEVIL AND ARCH-ENEMY
AND WHEN THEY ARE EVEN THE LAST MEN AND MORE BEAST THAN MAN THEN RISETH AND RISETH THE POPULACE IN HONOUR AND AT LAST SAITH EVEN THE POPULACE-VIRTUE
THAT ASKETH AND ASKETH AND NEVER TIRETH
THOU SAIDST THE TRUTH ZARATHUSTRA
LIKEWISE AM I NO LONGER MERRY EVEN FOR AN HOUR EXCEPT IT BE IN RECOLLECTIONS
I LOVE EVERYTHING THAT LOOKETH BRIGHT AND SPEAKETH HONESTLY
COME THOU BACK
WHEN ALOFT I FIND MYSELF ALWAYS ALONE
LO I ALONE AM VIRTUE WHAT HAVE I JUST HEARD
THEY WHIMPER BEFORE THEE AS BEFORE A GOD OR DEVIL
AND WHAT TOOK PLACE THEN THINK YE
THE HONEY SACRIFICE
THE HONEY SACRIFICE
THE HONEY SACRIFICE
WHEN I CAME UNTO MEN THEN FOUND I THEM RESTING ON AN OLD INFATUATION
IN THE REARING OF EXCEPTIONAL MEN THE NOTION OF REARING THE SUPERMAN IS ONLY A NEW FORM OF AN IDEAL NIETZSCHE ALREADY HAD IN HIS YOUTH THAT THE OBJECT OF MANKIND SHOULD LIE IN ITS HIGHEST INDIVIDUALS OR AS HE WRITES IN SCHOPENHAUER AS EDUCATOR
AND THESE ROOMS AND CHAMBERS--CAN MEN GO OUT AND IN THERE
WITHDRAW FROM THE STEAM OF THESE HUMAN SACRIFICES
SO UNLEARN I PRAY YOU THE SORROW-SIGHING AND ALL THE POPULACE-SADNESS
CURSE ALL THE COWARDLY DEVILS IN YOU THAT WOULD FAIN WHIMPER AND FOLD THE HANDS AND ADORE"--THEN DO THEY SHOUT
XXXIX
XXXIX
ONCE WAS DOUBT EVIL AND THE WILL TO SELF
THEN DID LIFE ANSWER ME THUS AND KEPT THEREBY HER FINE EARS CLOSED
THESE LITERALLY SHADOW THE MOST DARING MOVEMENTS IN THE SCIENCE AND ART OF THEIR GENERATION
THUS IS THE LIGHT OF YOUR VIRTUE STILL ON ITS WAY EVEN WHEN ITS WORK IS DONE
THERE COMETH THE TIME OF THE MOST DESPICABLE MAN WHO CAN NO LONGER DESPISE HIMSELF
AMONG THE NOTES OF THIS PERIOD WE FOUND A PAGE ON WHICH IS WRITTEN THE FIRST DEFINITE PLAN OF THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA MIDDAY AND ETERNITY GUIDE-POSTS TO A NEW WAY OF LIVING BENEATH THIS IS WRITTEN ZARATHUSTRA BORN ON LAKE URMI
IT IS BEYOND MY POWER THEN WAS THERE AGAIN SPOKEN UNTO ME WITHOUT VOICE
THOU ART NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PRESENT IT TO ME THEN FELL THE ADDER AGAIN ON HIS NECK AND LICKED HIS WOUND
IT WAS A PIOUS STRANGE LITANY IN PRAISE OF THE ADORED AND CENSED ASS
HE ALONE WOULD SUFFICE TO CARRY NIETZSCHE'S POINT AGAINST ALL THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THE OTHER CONDITIONS TO THE CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE SAVED ROME WHICH HAVE MAINTAINED THE STRENGTH OF THE JEWISH RACE AND WHICH ARE STRICTLY MAINTAINED BY EVERY BREEDER OF ANIMALS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
BUT INABILITY TO LIE IS STILL FAR FROM BEING LOVE TO TRUTH
CHAPTER LXVIII
AND AGAIN PASSED MOONS AND YEARS OVER ZARATHUSTRA'S SOUL AND HE HEEDED IT NOT
AH MY BRETHREN
I OFTEN OVERLEAP THE STEPS WHEN I CLAMBER
PERHAPS THOU GRINDEST CORN
ONE TAKES--ONE DOES NOT ASK WHO GIVES
I KNOW THE AXE THAT FELLETH THEE
TO TRAFFIC AND BARGAIN FOR POWER--WITH THE RABBLE
AND WHEN I CAME OUT OF MY SOLITUDE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME PASSED OVER THIS BRIDGE THEN I COULD NOT TRUST MINE EYES BUT LOOKED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SAID AT LAST
THE LIGHTNING HOWEVER IS THE SUPERMAN 5
UNTO THEM I LOOK INTO THE EYE,--BEFORE THEM I SAY IT UNTO THEIR FACE AND UNTO THE BLUSH ON THEIR CHEEKS
IT TOSSETH ABOUT DREAMILY ON HARD PILLOWS
THUS WILL YE JUSTIFY YOUR OWN SURVIVAL
HE EXPLAINS WHY HE WAS COMPELLED TO ASSAIL THE CHRISTIAN VALUES OF PITY AND EXCESSIVE LOVE OF THE NEIGHBOUR NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE SLAVE-VALUES AND THEREFORE TEND TO PROMOTE DEGENERATION SEE NOTE B BUT BECAUSE HE COULD ONLY LOVE HIS CHILDREN'S LAND THE UNDISCOVERED LAND IN A REMOTE SEA
WHEN DID EVER A DRAGON DIE OF A SERPENT'S POISON?"--SAID HE
ONE CAN ONLY BE SILENT AND SIT PEACEFULLY WHEN ONE HATH ARROW AND BOW
HE HATH REAWAKENED HIM
DOTH THE HELL-HOUND HERE YELP AT YOU
THAT THOU MUST BE THE FIRST TO TEACH THIS TEACHING--HOW COULD THIS GREAT FATE NOT BE THY GREATEST DANGER AND INFIRMITY
MAN SHALL NOW EXPLOIT CHANCE HE SAYS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND MAKE IT FALL ON ITS KNEES BEFORE HIM
THUS DID MY WISE LONGING BORN IN THE MOUNTAINS CRY AND LAUGH IN ME
AND OFT DID IT CARRY ME OFF AND UP AND AWAY AND IN THE MIDST OF LAUGHTER
FOR THOUGH HIS PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT MAY HAVE REACHED ITS LIMIT THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH HIS MENTAL OR SPIRITUAL ATTRIBUTES
THEY DISLIKE THEREFORE TO HEAR OF CONTEMPT OF THEMSELVES
EVEN THAT IS ELEVATION
HOW GRATEFUL AM I TO MINE ENEMIES THAT I MAY AT LAST HURL IT
CHAPTER XXXIII
BUT HE WHO WOULD BECOME A CHILD MUST SURMOUNT EVEN HIS YOUTH AND I CONSIDERED A LONG WHILE AND TREMBLED
THE EVIDENCE TEACHETH IT O ZARATHUSTRA,--THINE OWN EVIDENCE AND THOU THYSELF FINALLY SAID ZARATHUSTRA AND TURNED TOWARDS THE UGLIEST MAN WHO STILL LAY ON THE GROUND STRETCHING UP HIS ARM TO THE ASS FOR HE GAVE IT WINE TO DRINK SAY THOU NONDESCRIPT WHAT HAST THOU BEEN ABOUT
THE THIRD ONE IS THE CORK WHICH PREVENTETH THE CONVERSATION OF THE TWO SINKING INTO THE DEPTH
HE WHOSE SOUL LONGETH TO EXPERIENCE THE WHOLE RANGE OF HITHERTO RECOGNISED VALUES AND DESIRABILITIES AND TO CIRCUMNAVIGATE ALL THE COASTS OF THIS IDEAL MEDITERRANEAN SEA WHO FROM THE ADVENTURES OF HIS MOST PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WANTS TO KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO BE A CONQUEROR AND DISCOVERER OF THE IDEAL--AS LIKEWISE HOW IT IS WITH THE ARTIST THE SAINT THE LEGISLATOR THE SAGE THE SCHOLAR THE DEVOTEE THE PROPHET AND THE GODLY NON-CONFORMIST OF THE OLD STYLE:--REQUIRES ONE THING ABOVE ALL FOR THAT PURPOSE GREAT HEALTHINESS--SUCH HEALTHINESS AS ONE NOT ONLY POSSESSES BUT ALSO CONSTANTLY ACQUIRES AND MUST ACQUIRE BECAUSE ONE UNCEASINGLY SACRIFICES IT AGAIN AND MUST SACRIFICE IT!--AND NOW AFTER HAVING BEEN LONG ON THE WAY IN THIS FASHION WE ARGONAUTS OF THE IDEAL MORE COURAGEOUS PERHAPS THAN PRUDENT AND OFTEN ENOUGH SHIPWRECKED AND BROUGHT TO GRIEF NEVERTHELESS DANGEROUSLY HEALTHY ALWAYS HEALTHY AGAIN,--IT WOULD SEEM AS IF IN RECOMPENSE FOR IT ALL THAT WE HAVE A STILL
AND THEREFORE DID ONE BELIEVE EVERYTHING IS FATE
AND VERILY THOU SPAKEST LIKE A BUFFOON
IT IS NO LONGER WORTH WHILE TO LIVE EVERYTHING IS INDIFFERENT EVERYTHING IS USELESS
SO DESIRETH GOOD SLEEP
SO DESIRETH GOOD SLEEP
BUT NOT LONG HAD HE STRUGGLED WITH THE PAIN WHEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK THUS
SICKNESS SPEAKETH IN SUCH CRAVING AND INVISIBLE DEGENERATION
AND A THOUSAND CARICATURES OF CHILDREN ANGELS OWLS FOOLS AND CHILD-SIZED BUTTERFLIES LAUGHED AND MOCKED AND ROARED AT ME
AND DO NOT FORGET THE GOOD LAUGHTER
TO ENCOURAGE A DESPAIRING ONE--EVERY ONE THINKETH HIMSELF STRONG ENOUGH TO DO SO
EVERYTHING HATH BEEN RADICALLY CONTORTED AND DISTORTED BY THE GOOD
THOU SHALT NOT CRAVE!"--THIS NEW TABLE FOUND I HANGING EVEN IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS
OTHERS WITH PHANTOMS
THEY TINKLE WITH THEIR PINCHBECK THEY JINGLE WITH THEIR GOLD
ARE POISONED FOUNTAINS NECESSARY AND STINKING FIRES AND FILTHY DREAMS AND MAGGOTS IN THE BREAD OF LIFE
ALL VALUES HAVE ALREADY BEEN CREATED AND ALL CREATED VALUES--DO I REPRESENT
THEN HOWEVER DID IT COME TO PASS THAT ZARATHUSTRA ASTONISHED AT SUCH MERELY ROGUISH ANSWERS JUMPED BACK TO THE DOOR OF HIS CAVE AND TURNING TOWARDS ALL HIS GUESTS CRIED OUT WITH A STRONG VOICE
WHEN LISTENING HIS OWN TONGUE WAS AT LAST LOOSENED AND THE ICE OF HIS HEART BROKE
HOSTILE WILL IT BE TO HIM AND TO ITS LAST GOD
BUT MEDIARIES AND MIXERS ARE THEY UNTO ME AND HALF-AND-HALF AND IMPURE AH I CAST INDEED MY NET INTO THEIR SEA AND MEANT TO CATCH GOOD FISH
AND VERILY IT WERE TIME THAT I WENT AWAY
EVERY WORD ALSO IS NOT SUITED FOR EVERY MOUTH
A STATE
ONCE SPIRIT WAS GOD THEN IT BECAME MAN AND NOW IT EVEN BECOMETH POPULACE
HOW FAR IT DIFFERS FROM THAT OF CHRISTIANITY WE HAVE ALREADY READ IN THE DISCOURSE NEIGHBOUR-LOVE BUT HERE HE TELLS US DEFINITELY THE NATURE OF HIS LOVE TO MANKIND
NOW HAVE COME EVENING AND NIGHT AND MIDNIGHT,--THE DOG HOWLETH THE WIND
WITH THEE HATH THERE COME TO ME AN INVOLUNTARY BLISS
WHOM WAS I MEANT TO BELIEVE IN WHEN THOU WAILEDST IN SUCH WISE THE PENITENT IN SPIRIT SAID THE OLD MAN IT WAS HIM--I REPRESENTED
THEN FLEW THE DOVES TO AND FRO AND PERCHED ON HIS SHOULDER AND CARESSED HIS WHITE HAIR AND DID NOT TIRE OF THEIR TENDERNESS AND JOYOUSNESS
VERILY HE BELIEVETH ONLY IN GODS THAT MAKE A GREAT NOISE IN THE WORLD
WHAT WOULD THERE BE TO CREATE IF THERE WERE--GODS
MY BRETHREN I ADVISE YOU NOT TO NEIGHBOUR-LOVE--I ADVISE YOU TO FURTHEST LOVE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
READ MY RIDDLE
THEN INDEED WERE DELUSION AND FAITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT
THE BEST AND DEAREST TO ME AT PRESENT IS STILL A SOUND PEASANT COARSE ARTFUL OBSTINATE AND ENDURING
THUS GOEST THOU EASIER OVER THE BRIDGE
IN THE MOUNTAINS THE SHORTEST WAY IS FROM PEAK TO PEAK BUT FOR THAT ROUTE THOU MUST HAVE LONG LEGS
NOW HE DRAGGETH ME TO HELL
BETTER TO ADORE GOD SO IN THIS FORM THAN IN NO FORM AT ALL
SAY SAY
OF THIS DO THEY PLUME AND PRIDE THEMSELVES BEFORE ALL MORTALS
LIFE IS THE CONTINUOUS ADJUSTMENT OF INTERNAL RELATIONS TO EXTERNAL RELATIONS AGAIN IN THE MOTIVE FORCE BEHIND ANIMAL AND PLANT LIFE NIETZSCHE DISAGREES WITH DARWIN
I AM NOT ON MY GUARD AGAINST DECEIVERS
BUT I CAME NIGH UNTO YOU
AND ALL AT ONCE THERE CAME OVER ZARATHUSTRA A GREAT SHAME BECAUSE HE HAD GAZED ON SUCH A THING
THROW THYSELF ABOUT,--OUTWARD BACKWARD THOU LIGHT ONE
OH WHERE IS THERE DELIVERANCE FROM THE FLUX OF THINGS AND FROM THE EXISTENCE OF PENALTY THUS DID MADNESS PREACH
I NEED HARDLY POINT OUT THEREFORE HOW DEEPLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE RESPONSIBILITY HE THREW UPON OUR SHOULDERS WHEN HE INVITED US TO RECONSIDER OUR POSITION
TOO MANY EXTRANEOUS HEAVY WORDS AND WORTHS LOADETH HE UPON HIMSELF--THEN SEEMETH LIFE TO HIM A DESERT
HOW COULD I PRESUME TO DO SO
GOOD CLOCKWORKS ARE THEY
WHAT STILL REMAINETH TO ME
SUCH REVENGE DOTH MINE ABUNDANCE THINK OF
EVEN THUS EAGLELIKE PANTHERLIKE ARE THE POET'S DESIRES ARE THINE OWN DESIRES NEATH A THOUSAND GUISES THOU FOOL
THEN DID I LOVE SUCH ORIENTAL MAIDENS AND OTHER BLUE KINGDOMS OF HEAVEN OVER WHICH HANG NO CLOUDS AND NO THOUGHTS
BUT THE PEOPLE YE REMAIN FOR ME EVEN WITH YOUR VIRTUES THE PEOPLE WITH PURBLIND EYES--THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW NOT WHAT SPIRIT IS
NOW IT IS WITH THE VIEW OF GIVING A LITTLE ADDITIONAL HELP TO ALL THOSE WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN THIS POSITION THAT I PROCEED TO PUT FORTH MY OWN PERSONAL INTERPRETATION OF THE MORE ABSTRUSE PASSAGES IN THIS WORK
THUS HAVE I TAUGHT YOU MY FRIENDS
PRONE OUTSTRETCHED TREMBLING LIKE HIM HALF DEAD AND COLD WHOSE FEET ONE WARM'TH AND SHAKEN AH
LET YOUR LOVE TO LIFE BE LOVE TO YOUR HIGHEST HOPE
THEY ARE MINE ANIMALS SAID ZARATHUSTRA AND REJOICED IN HIS HEART
FOR MANY ARE ON THEIR WAY TO THEE MANY SUFFERING DOUBTING DESPAIRING DROWNING FREEZING ONES I WARN THEE ALSO AGAINST MYSELF
AND OFTEN EMPTIEST THOU THE GOBLET AGAIN IN WANTING TO FILL IT
TO DESERT OUR CAUSE WHEN IT CELEBRATETH ITS TRIUMPH
GREAT OBLIGATIONS DO NOT MAKE GRATEFUL BUT REVENGEFUL
ABOUT THE HOUR OF NOONTIDE HOWEVER WHEN THE SUN STOOD EXACTLY OVER ZARATHUSTRA'S HEAD HE PASSED AN OLD BENT AND GNARLED TREE WHICH WAS ENCIRCLED ROUND BY THE ARDENT LOVE OF A VINE AND HIDDEN FROM ITSELF
HE OVERCAME PESSIMISM BY DISCOVERING AN OBJECT IN EXISTENCE
BUT IN THIS HE WAS DECEIVED
WITH ANOTHER LOVE SHALL I THEN LOVE YOU."--ZARATHUSTRA I THE BESTOWING VIRTUE XXIII
ICE-COLD ARE THE INNERMOST WELLS OF THE SPIRIT
BUT HE LACKETH THE HUNDRED SICKLES
DESTROYERS WILL THEY BE CALLED AND DESPISERS OF GOOD AND EVIL
WHEREVER THOU BITEST THERE ARISETH BLACK SCAB
BUT ZARATHUSTRA SAID IN HIS PROLOGUE
HE COULD NOT CREDIT THE SAME MAN WITH SENTIMENTS SOMETIMES SO NOBLE AND AT OTHER TIMES SO VULGAR AND IN PRESENTING US WITH THIS NEW PORTRAIT OF THE SAVIOUR PURGED OF ALL IMPURITIES NIETZSCHE RENDERED MILITARY HONOURS TO A FOE WHICH FAR EXCEED IN WORTH ALL THAT HIS MOST ARDENT DISCIPLES HAVE EVER CLAIMED FOR HIM
THE POPULACE HOWEVER--THAT MEANETH HODGEPODGE
MUCH HATH ZARATHUSTRA SPOKEN ALSO TO US WOMEN BUT NEVER SPAKE HE UNTO US CONCERNING WOMAN AND I ANSWERED HER
OF A LION WORTHY OR PERHAPS OF A VIRTUOUS HOWL-MONKEY BUT IT'S NAUGHT TO YOU YE FRIENDLY DAMSELS DEARLY LOVED AT WHOSE OWN FEET TO ME THE FIRST OCCASION TO A EUROPEAN UNDER PALM-TREES A SEAT IS NOW GRANTED
BUT THEY HAVE THEIR VIRTUE IN ORDER TO LIVE LONG AND IN WRETCHED SELF-COMPLACENCY
HAVE NOT ALL RAILINGS AND FOOT-BRIDGES FALLEN INTO THE WATER
INTO A GOD'S MASK HATH YOUR EXECRABLE COILING SNAKE CRAWLED
BUT WILT THOU NOT WEEP WILT THOU NOT WEEP FORTH THY PURPLE MELANCHOLY THEN WILT THOU HAVE TO SING O MY SOUL!--BEHOLD I SMILE MYSELF WHO FORETELL THEE THIS
IT SHALL LEARN--TO WORK FOR ME MY WISDOM HATH ACCUMULATED LONG LIKE A CLOUD IT BECOMETH STILLER AND DARKER
YE TELL ME LIFE IS HARD TO BEAR BUT FOR WHAT PURPOSE SHOULD YE HAVE YOUR PRIDE IN THE MORNING AND YOUR RESIGNATION IN THE EVENING
ONLY THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE HAD NOT BEEN CAUGHT
DESPISERS OF LIFE ARE THEY DECAYING ONES AND POISONED ONES THEMSELVES OF WHOM THE EARTH IS WEARY
OPEN UP THOU HUMAN ABYSS
YEA MUCH BITTER DYING MUST THERE BE IN YOUR LIFE YE CREATORS
HEROES AND HONOURABLE ONES IT WOULD FAIN SET UP AROUND IT THE NEW IDOL
MERE POET
MERE POET
MERE POET
HIS TEACHING AS IS WELL KNOWN PLACES THE ARISTOTELIAN MAN OF SPIRIT ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN THE NATURAL DIVISIONS OF MAN
BUT THE AWAKENED ONE THE KNOWING ONE SAITH
THEY BITE AT ME BECAUSE I SAY UNTO THEM THAT FOR SMALL PEOPLE SMALL VIRTUES ARE NECESSARY--AND BECAUSE IT IS HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT SMALL PEOPLE ARE NECESSARY
I WISH THEM NEITHER TO LEARN AFRESH NOR TEACH ANEW BUT ONLY TO BID FAREWELL TO THEIR OWN BODIES,--AND THUS BE DUMB
DOTH NOT THE TRUE SAGE WILLINGLY WALK ON THE CROOKEDEST PATHS
LXV
LXV
ALMOST TOO VIOLENTLY DOST THOU FLOW FOR ME THOU FOUNTAIN OF DELIGHT
IF A PEOPLE WILL MAINTAIN ITSELF HOWEVER IT MUST NOT VALUE AS ITS NEIGHBOUR VALUETH
WHAT AM I AND IF THAT BE THE TRUE VIRTUE WHICH IS UNCONSCIOUS OF ITSELF--WELL THE VAIN MAN IS UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS MODESTY THIS IS HOWEVER MY THIRD MANLY PRUDENCE
THEIR KNEES CONTINUALLY ADORE AND THEIR HANDS ARE EULOGIES OF VIRTUE BUT THEIR HEART KNOWETH NAUGHT THEREOF
BUT SERVING ONES DO THEY REMAIN AND HARNESSED ONES EVEN THOUGH THEY GLITTER IN GOLDEN HARNESS
THE THAWING WIND A BULLOCK WHICH IS NO PLOUGHING BULLOCK--A FURIOUS BULLOCK A DESTROYER WHICH WITH ANGRY HORNS BREAKETH THE ICE
IF THE EXPLORING DELIGHT BE IN ME WHICH IMPELLETH SAILS TO THE UNDISCOVERED IF THE SEAFARER'S DELIGHT BE IN MY DELIGHT
AND ALSO FROM THEE THEY WANT YEA OR NAY
ZARATHUSTRA REJOICED ON ACCOUNT OF THE STAFF AND SUPPORTED HIMSELF THEREON
AND ON THAT ACCOUNT ALSO DID THEY TOLERATE YOUR UNBELIEF BECAUSE IT WAS A PLEASANTRY AND A BY-PATH FOR THE PEOPLE
BUT WHOEVER WISH TO EAT WITH US MUST ALSO GIVE A HAND TO THE WORK EVEN THE KINGS
IN THIS RESPECT IT MAY SEEM A LITTLE TRIVIAL TO SPEAK OF EXTREMES MEETING
THE WICKED GADFLY WHICH IS MOUNTED ON THE VAINEST PEOPLES
OH PITY FOR THAT LOVELIEST OTHER LEG
VERILY A FINE CATCH OF FISH HATH ZARATHUSTRA MADE TO-DAY
IF I DID NOT MYSELF COMMISERATE THEIR PITY THE PITY OF THOSE ENVIERS AND INJURERS
ALL THE ANIMALS HATH MAN ALREADY ROBBED OF THEIR VIRTUES
EVERYTHING AMONG THEM TALKETH EVERYTHING IS OUT-TALKED
OR A DREAMER
BEFORE MY HIGHEST MOUNTAIN DO I STAND AND BEFORE MY LONGEST WANDERING
OH WHITHER HATH MY HOSTILITY NOT FLOWN AND MISFLOWN
I WILL RUN ALONE SO THAT IT MAY AGAIN BECOME BRIGHT AROUND ME
JOYFUL SCIENCE BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS THE ANTICHRIST THE WILL TO POWER ETC ETC AS THE NECESSARY PREPARATION FOR THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA THESE DIRECTIONS THOUGH THEY ARE BY NO MEANS SIMPLE TO CARRY OUT SEEM AT LEAST TO POSSESS THE QUALITY OF DEFINITENESS AND STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS
THEREBY WILL THEY LEARN TO RENOUNCE THE WORLD AND THINE OWN REASON--THIS SHALT THOU THYSELF STIFLE AND CHOKE
ECONOMY WAS NEVER PRECISELY ONE OF NATURE'S LEADING PRINCIPLES
WHOEVER HATH TO GIVE BIRTH IS SICK
TO THE RHYTHM OF MY WHIP SHALT THOU DANCE AND CRY
THAT IS MY VICTORY
VERILY NO FOOD OF WHICH THE IMPURE COULD BE FELLOW-PARTAKERS
YE SEE ME TROUBLED DRIVEN FORTH UNWILLINGLY OBEDIENT READY TO GO--ALAS TO GO AWAY FROM YOU
GLOOMY DID THIS HUNTER RETURN FROM THE FOREST OF KNOWLEDGE
AND WHAT THE SOOTHSAYER HAD PRESAGED
THROW ONLY SEED-CORN UNTO THEM!--THEY KNOW WELL HOW TO GRIND CORN SMALL AND MAKE WHITE DUST OUT OF IT
RATHER WILL I BE A PILLAR-SAINT THAN A WHIRL OF VENGEANCE
READY MUST THOU BE TO BURN THYSELF IN THINE OWN FLAME
HOW EACH OF THY VIRTUES IS COVETOUS OF THE HIGHEST PLACE
THEY GREW OUT OF THE POETS THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
LXIII
LXIII
LXIII
THEN THOU CANST NOT BE A FRIEND
MEASURABLE BY HIM WHO HATH TIME WEIGHABLE BY A GOOD WEIGHER ATTAINABLE BY STRONG PINIONS DIVINABLE BY DIVINE NUT-CRACKERS
THAT IT MAY NOT SMOTHER IN THIS SORROWFULNESS
WHAT DOTH IT MATTER
IN THE LIES OF THE GOOD WERE YE BORN AND BRED
HE WAS RIGHT--WE DO LIE TOO MUCH
A DRAWER A TRAINER A TRAINING-MASTER WHO NOT IN VAIN COUNSELLED HIMSELF ONCE ON A TIME
IN THE FOLLOWING NOVEMBER WHILE STAYING AT MENTONE HE BEGAN TO ELABORATE THESE NOTES AND AFTER A LONG PAUSE FINISHED THE MANUSCRIPT AT NICE BETWEEN THE END OF JANUARY AND THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY 1885
MEANWHILE ONE AFTER ANOTHER HAD GONE OUT INTO THE OPEN AIR AND INTO THE COOL THOUGHTFUL NIGHT
AND EVEN SHOULD WE NOT LOVE EACH OTHER FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS,--MUST WE THEN HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST EACH OTHER IF WE DO NOT LOVE EACH OTHER PERFECTLY
AND IF THERE BE ANYTHING OF VIRTUE IN ME IT IS THAT I HAVE HAD NO FEAR OF ANY PROHIBITION
FOR EVERYTHING IS RIPE FOR THE HARVEST WITH HIM
CAST NOT AWAY THE HERO IN THY SOUL
THOU JOYOUS AWFUL NOONTIDE ABYSS
I LOVE YOU FROM THE VERY HEART
A BRIGHTER FLAME I CONTRIVED FOR MYSELF
IN THE MORNING HOWEVER AFTER THIS NIGHT ZARATHUSTRA JUMPED UP FROM HIS COUCH AND HAVING GIRDED HIS LOINS HE CAME OUT OF HIS CAVE GLOWING AND STRONG LIKE A MORNING SUN COMING OUT OF GLOOMY MOUNTAINS
AM I INDEED A GHOST
AND VERILY IT SOUNDETH AS PRAISE IN THEIR EARS FOR ONE TO TALK TO ALL THINGS--DIRECTLY
A MAN WAS HE AND ONLY A POOR FRAGMENT OF A MAN AND EGO
AS YET WOMAN IS NOT CAPABLE OF FRIENDSHIP
AS YET WOMAN IS NOT CAPABLE OF FRIENDSHIP
THEN LIVED THEY SHAMELESSLY IN TEMPORARY PLEASURES AND BEYOND THE DAY HAD HARDLY AN AIM
UP THEN YE WOMEN AND DISCOVER THE CHILD IN MAN
AND THERE
THAT THOU MAYEST BEAR THY GREAT FATE WHICH HATH NOT YET BEEN ANY ONE'S FATE
AND ALL THE IMPERISHABLE'--THAT IS ALSO BUT A SIMILE SO HAVE I HEARD THEE SAY ONCE BEFORE ANSWERED THE DISCIPLE AND THEN THOU ADDEDST
IS MY EXPERIENCE BUT OF YESTERDAY
AH MINE ANIMALS THIS ONLY HAVE I LEARNED HITHERTO THAT FOR MAN HIS BADDEST IS NECESSARY FOR HIS BEST THAT ALL THAT IS BADDEST IS THE BEST POWER AND THE HARDEST STONE FOR THE HIGHEST CREATOR
HE SIMPLY SAYS
IMMATURELY LOVETH THE YOUTH AND IMMATURELY ALSO HATETH HE MAN AND EARTH
TO CREATE DESIRETH THE LOVING ONE BECAUSE HE DESPISETH
VERILY HE DID NOT COME BY HIS SON OTHERWISE THAN BY SECRET WAYS
AND IF YE WILL NOT BE FATES AND INEXORABLE ONES HOW CAN YE ONE DAY CONQUER WITH ME
VERILY YE FILL YOUR MOUTH WITH NOBLE WORDS
THAT IS NOW MY TASTE,--RATHER WOULD I LIVE AMONGST THIEVES AND PERJURERS
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED NOT ONLY TO BE EATERS OF HUMAN FLESH BUT ALSO ASS-WORSHIPPERS AND AMONG THE ROMAN GRAFFITI THE MOST FAMOUS IS THE ONE FOUND ON THE PALATINO SHOWING A MAN WORSHIPPING A CROSS ON WHICH IS SUSPENDED A FIGURE WITH THE HEAD OF AN ASS SEE MINUCIUS FELIX OCTAVIUS IX
VERILY WITH LONGING IN MY HEART DID I COME
LONG SLEPT ZARATHUSTRA
THE MAN OF KNOWLEDGE MUST BE ABLE NOT ONLY TO LOVE HIS ENEMIES BUT ALSO TO HATE HIS FRIENDS
BUT SO ENJOINETH THEIR BELIEF
O NOONTIDE
NOW GLOWETH THE SUN UPON HIM AND THE DOGS LICK AT HIS SWEAT
IN THY PURITY TO HIDE MYSELF--THAT IS MINE INNOCENCE
INNUMERABLE ARE THE SMALL AND PITIABLE ONES
BUT WHEN DID ONE HEAR OF A MOTHER WANTING TO BE PAID FOR HER LOVE
IN THE SUNNY CORNER OF MINE OLIVE-MOUNT DO I SING AND MOCK AT ALL PITY THUS SANG ZARATHUSTRA
AROUND THEM WAS NOT ONLY THE DEVIL LOOSE--BUT ALSO THE SWINE
THE DOVES HOWEVER WERE NO LESS EAGER WITH THEIR LOVE THAN THE LION
OR A DREAM-READER
HE THAT WRITETH IN BLOOD AND PROVERBS DOTH NOT WANT TO BE READ BUT LEARNT BY HEART
WHAT NIETZSCHE STRIVES TO COMBAT AND TO OVERTHROW IS THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC TENDENCY WHICH IS SLOWLY LABOURING TO LEVEL ALL THINGS--EVEN THE SEXES
ENTIRE
AH I HAVE BEGUN MY LONESOMEST WANDERING
TOO DESTITUTE ARE THEY OF BASHFULNESS
THERE IS THE ORIGIN OF YOUR VIRTUE
THERE IS THE ORIGIN OF YOUR VIRTUE
THERE IS THE ORIGIN OF YOUR VIRTUE
THERE IS THE ORIGIN OF YOUR VIRTUE
THERE IS THE ORIGIN OF YOUR VIRTUE
CEASE TO SPLASH THEREON THOU RAIN-CLOUD OF THE FORENOON
IN THEIR NEIGHBOURHOOD I LIKE TO LOOK UPON LIFE--IT CURETH OF MELANCHOLY
BUT DAY AND WORLD YE ARE TOO COARSE HAVE CLEVERER HANDS GRASP AFTER DEEPER HAPPINESS AFTER DEEPER UNHAPPINESS GRASP AFTER SOME GOD
BUT NOW HAST THOU ONLY THY VIRTUES
HATH HE SPIRIT THEN DOTH HE CONCEAL IT
I HAVE HAD SOME OPPORTUNITIES OF STUDYING THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH NIETZSCHE IS READ IN GERMANY FRANCE AND ENGLAND AND I HAVE FOUND THAT IN EACH OF THESE COUNTRIES STUDENTS OF HIS PHILOSOPHY AS IF ACTUATED BY PRECISELY SIMILAR MOTIVES AND DESIRES AND MISLED BY THE SAME MISTAKEN TACTICS ON THE PART OF MOST PUBLISHERS ALL PROCEED IN THE SAME HAPPY-GO-LUCKY STYLE WHEN TAKING HIM UP THEY HAVE HAD IT SAID TO THEM THAT HE WROTE WITHOUT ANY SYSTEM AND THEY VERY NATURALLY CONCLUDE THAT IT DOES NOT MATTER IN THE LEAST WHETHER THEY BEGIN WITH HIS FIRST THIRD OR LAST BOOK PROVIDED THEY CAN OBTAIN A FEW VAGUE IDEAS AS TO WHAT HIS LEADING AND MOST SENSATIONAL PRINCIPLES WERE
THAT IS WHY I LIVE HERE
IN VERSE 20 ZARATHUSTRA MAKES YET ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT DEFINING HIS ENTIRELY ANTI-ANARCHICAL ATTITUDE AND UNLESS SUCH PASSAGES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY OVERLOOKED OR DELIBERATELY IGNORED HITHERTO BY THOSE WHO WILL PERSIST IN LAYING ANARCHY AT HIS DOOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE EVER BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH THAT FOUL POLITICAL PARTY
YEA I RECOGNISE ZARATHUSTRA
TO RISE STRIVETH LIFE AND IN RISING TO SURPASS ITSELF
PERHAPS HE LOVETH IN THEE THE UNMOVED EYE AND THE LOOK OF ETERNITY
THOU SHALT NOT SLAY!"--SUCH PRECEPTS WERE ONCE CALLED HOLY
I COUNSEL TO INNOCENCE IN YOUR INSTINCTS IN VERSE 7 OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH AS IN VERSE I OF PARAGRAPH 19 IN THE OLD AND NEW TABLES NIETZSCHE GIVES US A REASON FOR HIS OCCASIONAL OBSCURITY SEE ALSO VERSES 3 TO 7 OF POETS AS I HAVE ALREADY POINTED OUT HIS PHILOSOPHY IS QUITE ESOTERIC
YOUR PEOPLE WOULD YE JUSTIFY IN THEIR REVERENCE
IT IS GETTING ON TO MIDNIGHT!"--AND HIS VOICE HAD CHANGED
I SERVE THOU SERVEST WE SERVE"--SO PRAYETH ALL APPOINTABLE VIRTUE TO THE PRINCE
AND EVEN IF ONE HAVE ALL THE VIRTUES THERE IS STILL ONE THING NEEDFUL
THAT ALONE MY BRETHREN IS OUR ORIGINAL SIN
AND EVEN IN THE WILL OF THE SERVANT FOUND I THE WILL TO BE MASTER
HATH SHE BECOME OVERAWAKE
HARDLY HOWEVER HAD ZARATHUSTRA LEFT THE CAVE WHEN THE OLD MAGICIAN GOT UP LOOKED CUNNINGLY ABOUT HIM AND SAID
THIS SOMNOLENCE DID I DISTURB WHEN I TAUGHT THAT NO ONE YET KNOWETH WHAT IS GOOD AND BAD:--UNLESS IT BE THE CREATING ONE
BY UNFAMILIAR FEVERS SHIVERING WITH SHARPENED ICY-COLD FROST-ARROWS BY THEE PURSUED MY FANCY
THEREAT MAYEST THOU NOT WONDER
HATEFUL TO IT ALTOGETHER AND A LOATHING IS HE WHO WILL NEVER DEFEND HIMSELF HE WHO SWALLOWETH DOWN POISONOUS SPITTLE AND BAD LOOKS THE ALL-TOO-PATIENT ONE THE ALL-ENDURER THE ALL-SATISFIED ONE
THE EARTH WILL HE CHRISTEN ANEW--AS THE LIGHT BODY THE OSTRICH RUNNETH FASTER THAN THE FASTEST HORSE BUT IT ALSO THRUSTETH ITS HEAD HEAVILY INTO THE HEAVY EARTH
AND THOUGH THERE BE ON EARTH FENS AND DENSE AFFLICTIONS HE WHO HATH LIGHT FEET RUNNETH EVEN ACROSS THE MUD AND DANCETH AS UPON WELL-SWEPT ICE
FOR THAT I AM TOO WEAK
THERE THEY ALREADY LIE
TO THEM WINKED THE LAUGHTER OF MY WISDOM:--THEN DID THEY BETHINK THEMSELVES
THE DARING VENTURE THE PROLONGED DISTRUST THE CRUEL NAY THE TEDIUM THE CUTTING-INTO-THE-QUICK--HOW SELDOM DO THESE COME TOGETHER
CRACK NOT SO TERRIBLY WITH THY WHIP
BUT BEHOLD IT WAS A SLUMBERING MONSTER
III
III
AND WHAT HAVE I HATED MORE THAN PASSING CLOUDS AND WHATEVER TAINTETH THEE
THEN DID IT KICK ME ON THE FACE
THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT THOUGHTS THAT DO NOTHING MORE THAN THE BELLOWS
BUT THEY MISUNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
BETTER HOWEVER TO BE FOOLISH WITH HAPPINESS THAN FOOLISH WITH MISFORTUNE BETTER TO DANCE AWKWARDLY THAN WALK LAMELY
WISHEST THOU NOT AT LEAST TO MAKE BOOTY THEREBY
AH THAT YE UNDERSTOOD MY WORD
AH THAT YE UNDERSTOOD MY WORD
FOOLISH IS MY HAPPINESS AND FOOLISH THINGS WILL IT SPEAK
WHAT IS THAT CHURCH ANSWERED I THAT IS A KIND OF STATE AND INDEED THE MOST MENDACIOUS
THOU ART NOT YET HUMBLE ENOUGH FOR ME
THOU CAMEST NIGH UNTO THEM AND YET WENTEST PAST
BETTER THAN THY WORDS EXPRESS IT THINE EYES TELL ME ALL THY DANGER
ALAS WAS THIS PERHAPS THE HIGHER MAN WHOSE CRY I HEARD
ALL THAT IS UNHOMELIKE IN THE FUTURE AND WHATEVER MAKETH STRAYED BIRDS SHIVER IS VERILY MORE HOMELIKE AND FAMILIAR THAN YOUR REALITY FOR THUS SPEAK YE
AND THE WARMEST SOUTH IS STILL UNDISCOVERED BY MAN
AH THAT HIS BEST IS SO VERY SMALL
HOW DOTH THIS HARMONISE
BUT WHEN SHE SPEAKETH ILL OF HERSELF JUST THEN DOTH SHE SEDUCE MOST WHEN I HAD SAID THIS UNTO LIFE THEN LAUGHED SHE MALICIOUSLY AND SHUT HER EYES
AND WHEN THEY CALLED THEIR FILTHY DREAMS DELIGHT THEN POISONED THEY ALSO THE WORDS
AND WHERE DOTH MAN NOT STAND AT ABYSSES
ART THOU THE VICTORIOUS ONE THE SELF-CONQUEROR THE RULER OF THY PASSIONS THE MASTER OF THY VIRTUES
AND THEY THEMSELVES MAY WELL ORIGINATE FROM THE SEA
THEY TAKE FROM THEE AND ME WHAT IS COMMON TO US--THE VAST UNBOUNDED YEA AND AMEN-SAYING
THE NIGHT REMAINED CLEAR AND CALM AND HAPPINESS ITSELF CAME NIGHER AND NIGHER UNTO HIM
THIS HOWEVER IS MY TEACHING
THE LAST VERSE INTRODUCES THE EXPRESSION THE GREAT NOONTIDE IN THE POEM TO BE FOUND AT THE END OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL WE MEET WITH THE EXPRESSION AGAIN AND WE SHALL FIND IT OCCURRING TIME AND AGAIN IN NIETZSCHE'S WORKS
WHAT DOTH IT MATTER ABOUT US KINGS HERE HOWEVER IS MY DOMAIN AND JURISDICTION
THE OLD WANTETH THE GOOD MAN AND THAT THE OLD SHOULD BE CONSERVED
FROM THE GATEWAY THIS MOMENT THERE RUNNETH A LONG ETERNAL LANE BACKWARDS
TO THE DISCERNERS ALL IMPULSES SANCTIFY THEMSELVES
EVER DID HIS SOUL MARVEL AT HIS NEIGHBOUR'S DELUSION AND WICKEDNESS
AND THERE WAS SPOKEN UNTO ME FOR THE LAST TIME
WHO COMETH UNTO ME AND MY BAD SLEEP A LIVING MAN AND A DEAD ONE SAID ZARATHUSTRA
AND FROM NO ONE DO I WANT BEAUTY SO MUCH AS FROM THEE THOU POWERFUL ONE
MORE DANGEROUS HAVE I FOUND IT AMONG MEN THAN AMONG ANIMALS:'--THAT WAS FORSAKENNESS
IT IS BAD TO LIVE IN CITIES
ETERNALLY BUILDETH ITSELF THE SAME HOUSE OF EXISTENCE
THERE AROSE HOWEVER FROM THEM AS IT WERE A HEAVY CLOUD
TO BE SURE I AM A FOREST AND A NIGHT OF DARK TREES
