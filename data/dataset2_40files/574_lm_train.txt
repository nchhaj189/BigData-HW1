I HEAR THE WARBLING BIRDS BUT I FEED NOT THE WARBLING BIRDS THEY FLY AND SEEK THEIR FOOD
SOON HIS HEAVY MANE BORE THEM TO THE GROUND THEN HE STALKED AROUND SMELLING TO HIS PREY
LITTLE LAMB WHO MADE THEE
AND NOT SIT BOTH NIGHT AND DAY WIPING ALL OUR TEARS AWAY
SWEET JOY I CALL THEE
BIRD'S DELIGHT DAY AND NIGHT NIGHTINGALE IN THE DALE LARK IN SKY MERRILY MERRILY MERRILY TO WELCOME IN THE YEAR
AND I WEPT BOTH NIGHT AND DAY AND HE WIPED MY TEARS AWAY
GENTLE MAY I LAY ME DOWN AND GENTLE REST MY HEAD
AND ALL MUST LOVE THE HUMAN FORM IN HEATHEN TURK OR JEW
LOVE MERCY PITY PEACE
CAN A FATHER SEE HIS CHILD WEEP NOR BE WITH SORROW FILLED
LET ME PULL YOUR SOFT WOOL
GAVE THEE SUCH A TENDER VOICE MAKING ALL THE VALES REJOICE
FOLLY IS AN ENDLESS MAZE
FOR HE HEARS THE LAMBS INNOCENT CALL AND HE HEARS THE EWES TENDER REPLY
THEN I WENT TO MY PRETTY ROSE TREE TO TEND HER BY DAY AND BY NIGHT
THY PERFUME
COME HITHER AND SEE THE OPENING MORN IMAGE OF TRUTH NEW-BORN
SO HE TOOK HIS WINGS AND FLED
SONGS OF EXPERIENCE INTRODUCTION HEAR THE VOICE OF THE BARD WHO PRESENT PAST AND FUTURE SEES
WHERE THE YOUTH PINED AWAY WITH DESIRE AND THE PALE VIRGIN SHROUDED IN SNOW ARISE FROM THEIR GRAVES AND ASPIRE WHERE MY SUNFLOWER WISHES TO GO
THE HUM OF MULTITUDES WAS THERE BUT MULTITUDES OF LAMBS THOUSANDS OF LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS RAISING THEIR INNOCENT HANDS
IN TREMBLING ZEAL HE SEIZED HIS HAIR HE LED HIM BY HIS LITTLE COAT AND ALL ADMIRED THE PRIESTLY CARE
YET I LIVE AND LOVE
A CHAPEL WAS BUILT IN THE MIDST WHERE I USED TO PLAY ON THE GREEN
LET ME KISS YOUR SOFT FACE
AND FATHER HOW CAN I LOVE YOU OR ANY OF MY BROTHERS MORE
SELFISH VAIN ETERNAL BANE THAT FREE LOVE WITH BONDAGE BOUND THE CLOD AND THE PEBBLE LOVE SEEKETH NOT ITSELF TO PLEASE NOR FOR ITSELF HATH ANY CARE BUT FOR ANOTHER GIVES IT EASE AND BUILDS A HEAVEN IN HELL'S DESPAIR SO SANG A LITTLE CLOD OF CLAY TRODDEN WITH THE CATTLE'S FEET BUT A PEBBLE OF THE BROOK WARBLED OUT THESE METRES MEET
HE WEPT TO HEAR
I TOLD MY WRATH MY WRATH DID END
THY WINE DOTH PURIFY THE GOLDEN HONEY
THE GARDEN OF LOVE I LAID ME DOWN UPON A BANK WHERE LOVE LAY SLEEPING
WHERE CAN LYCA SLEEP
LITTLE LAMB I'LL TELL THEE
LITTLE LAMB I'LL TELL THEE
TURNING BACK WAS VAIN
IF HER HEART DOES ACHE THEN LET LYCA WAKE
ONCE A YOUTHFUL PAIR FILLED WITH SOFTEST CARE MET IN GARDEN BRIGHT WHERE THE HOLY LIGHT HAD JUST REMOVED THE CURTAINS OF THE NIGHT
OR THE GLISTENING EYE TO THE POISON OF A SMILE
THEL ENTER'D IN SAW THE SECRETS OF THE LAND UNKNOWN
WHAT THE HAMMER
WHY ARE EYELIDS STORD WITH ARROWS READY DRAWN WHERE A THOUSAND FIGHTING MEN IN AMBUSH LIE
AND THE DESERT WILD BECOME A GARDEN MILD
UNDER A CRUEL EYE OUTWORN THE LITTLE ONES SPEND THE DAY IN SIGHING AND DISMAY
SO I SAID HUSH TOM
AND PEACE THE HUMAN DRESS
GIVING TO THOSE THAT CANNOT CRAVE THE VOICELESS THE O'ER TIRED THE BREATH DOTH NOURISH THE INNOCENT LAMB HE SMELLS THE MILKY GARMENTS HE CROPS THY FLOWERS WHILE THOU SITTEST SMILING IN HIS FACE WIPING HIS MILD AND MEEKIN MOUTH FROM ALL CONTAGIOUS TAINTS
OH FATHER AND MOTHER IF BUDS ARE NIPPED AND BLOSSOMS BLOWN AWAY
BUT I SAID I'VE A PRETTY ROSE TREE AND I PASSED THE SWEET FLOWER O'ER
IS THAT TREMBLING CRY A SONG
CRUEL JEALOUS SELFISH FEAR
WHERE LAMBS HAVE NIBBLED SILENT MOVE THE FEET OF ANGELS BRIGHT
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF POEMS OF WILLIAM BLAKE BY WILLIAM BLAKE
A DREAM ONCE A DREAM DID WEAVE A SHADE O'ER MY ANGEL-GUARDED BED THAT AN EMMET LOST ITS WAY WHERE ON GRASS METHOUGHT I LAY
WHY WILT THOU TURN AWAY
FOLLOW NOW THE BEETLE'S HUM
FOR WHERE'ER THE SUN DOES SHINE AND WHERE'ER THE RAIN DOES FALL BABES SHOULD NEVER HUNGER THERE NOR POVERTY THE MIND APPALL
WEEP IN NOTES OF WOE
LITTLE GIRL SWEET AND SMALL
YOUR SPRING AND YOUR DAY ARE WASTED IN PLAY AND YOUR WINTER AND NIGHT IN DISGUISE
NEVER MIND IT FOR WHEN YOUR HEAD'S BARE YOU KNOW THAT THE SOOT CANNOT SPOIL YOUR WHITE HAIR AND SO HE WAS QUIET AND THAT VERY NIGHT AS TOM WAS A-SLEEPING HE HAD SUCH A SIGHT THAT THOUSANDS OF SWEEPERS DICK JOE NED AND JACK WERE ALL OF THEM LOCKED UP IN COFFINS OF BLACK
THE LITTLE BOY LOST FATHER FATHER WHERE ARE YOU GOING
ON HIS HEAD A CROWN ON HIS SHOULDERS DOWN FLOWED HIS GOLDEN HAIR
OH HE GIVES TO US HIS JOY THAT OUR GRIEF HE MAY DESTROY
THE DISTANT HUNTSMAN WINDS HIS HORN AND THE SKYLARK SINGS WITH ME
BUT IF AT THE CHURCH THEY WOULD GIVE US SOME ALE AND A PLEASANT FIRE OUR SOULS TO REGALE WE'D SING AND WE'D PRAY ALL THE LIVELONG DAY NOR EVER ONCE WISH FROM THE CHURCH TO STRAY
THEN HUMILITY TAKES ITS ROOT UNDERNEATH HIS FOOT
THE LITTLE VAGABOND DEAR MOTHER DEAR MOTHER THE CHURCH IS COLD
SWEET JOY BUT TWO DAYS OLD
CAN IT BE A SONG OF JOY
ON WHAT WINGS DARE HE ASPIRE
PRISONED ON WATERY SHORE STARRY JEALOUSY DOES KEEP MY DEN COLD AND HOAR
THINK NOT THOU CANST SIGH A SIGH AND THY MAKER IS NOT BY
PIPER SIT THEE DOWN AND WRITE IN A BOOK THAT ALL MAY READ SO HE VANISH'D FROM MY SIGHT
THEN CRUELTY KNITS A SNARE AND SPREADS HIS BAITS WITH CARE
DESCEND O LITTLE CLOUD HOVER BEFORE THE EYES OF THEL
HE DOTH GIVE HIS JOY TO ALL
AND THUS I SAY TO LITTLE ENGLISH BOY
DO FATHER MOTHER WEEP
TILL BEFORE THEIR WAY A COUCHING LION LAY
WITLESS WOE WAS NE'ER BEGUILED
THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER WHEN MY MOTHER DIED I WAS VERY YOUNG AND MY FATHER SOLD ME WHILE YET MY TONGUE COULD SCARCELY CRY WEEP
AND GOD LIKE A FATHER REJOICING TO SEE HIS CHILDREN AS PLEASANT AND HAPPY AS HE WOULD HAVE NO MORE QUARREL WITH THE DEVIL OR THE BARREL BUT KISS HIM AND GIVE HIM BOTH DRINK AND APPAREL
THE BIRDS ARE SILENT IN THEIR NEST AND I MUST SEEK FOR MINE
AND FEEL--THEY KNOW NOT WHAT BUT CARE
THOU DOST SMILE I SING THE WHILE
THEY LOOK IN EVERY THOUGHTLESS NEST WHERE BIRDS ARE COVERED WARM
AND IT GREW BOTH DAY AND NIGHT TILL IT BORE AN APPLE BRIGHT AND MY FOE BEHELD IT SHINE AND HE KNEW THAT IT WAS MINE AND INTO MY GARDEN STOLE WHEN THE NIGHT HAD VEILED THE POLE
WHILE THE LILY WHITE SHALL IN LOVE DELIGHT NOR A THORN NOR A THREAT STAIN HER BEAUTY BRIGHT
WRATH BY HIS MEEKNESS AND BY HIS HEALTH SICKNESS ARE DRIVEN AWAY FROM OUR IMMORTAL DAY
THE SUN DOES DESCEND AND OUR SPORTS HAVE AN END
THE LITTLE BOY FOUND THE LITTLE BOY LOST IN THE LONELY FEN LED BY THE WANDERING LIGHT BEGAN TO CRY BUT GOD EVER NIGH APPEARED LIKE HIS FATHER IN WHITE
OH WHAT A MULTITUDE THEY SEEMED THESE FLOWERS OF LONDON TOWN
AH SUNFLOWER AH SUNFLOWER WEARY OF TIME WHO COUNTEST THE STEPS OF THE SUN
LOVE SEEKETH ONLY SELF TO PLEASE TO BIND ANOTHER TO ITS DELIGHT JOYS IN ANOTHER'S LOSS OF EASE AND BUILDS A HELL IN HEAVEN'S DESPITE HOLY THURSDAY IS THIS A HOLY THING TO SEE IN A RICH AND FRUITFUL LAND BABES REDUCED TO MISERY FED WITH COLD AND USUROUS HAND
OR ART NOT THOU A MAN LIKE ME
LOOK ON THE RISING SUN
THE LITTLE BLACK BOY MY MOTHER BORE ME IN THE SOUTHERN WILD AND I AM BLACK BUT OH MY SOUL IS WHITE
IV
BUT THE ALEHOUSE IS HEALTHY AND PLEASANT AND WARM
AH WEEP NOT LITTLE VOICE THOU CAN'ST NOT SPEAK BUT THOU CAN'ST WEEP
SWEET SMILES MOTHER'S SMILE ALL THE LIVELONG NIGHT BEGUILE
DIVINE IMAGE TO MERCY PITY PEACE AND LOVE ALL PRAY IN THEIR DISTRESS AND TO THESE VIRTUES OF DELIGHT RETURN THEIR THANKFULNESS
BLAKE
OR AN EYE OF GIFTS GRACES SHOWRING FRUITS COINED GOLD
I HAPPY AM JOY IS MY NAME SWEET JOY BEFALL THEE
GONE WAS ALL THEIR CARE
WEEP
WEEP
AND I SAW IT WAS FILLED WITH GRAVES AND TOMBSTONES WHERE FLOWERS SHOULD BE
THEY LOOK UPON HIS EYES FILLED WITH DEEP SURPRISE
IF THEY SEE ANY WEEPING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SLEEPING THEY POUR SLEEP ON THEIR HEAD AND SIT DOWN BY THEIR BED
THAT GOD WOULD LOVE A WORM I KNEW AND PUNISH THE EVIL FOOT THAT WILFUL BRUIS'D ITS HELPLESS FORM
TO TIRZAH WHATE'ER IS BORN OF MORTAL BIRTH MUST BE CONSUMED WITH THE EARTH TO RISE FROM GENERATION FREE
WHAT THE HAND DARE SEIZE THE FIRE
SHE WANDERED IN THE LAND OF CLOUDS THRO VALLEYS DARK LISTNING DOLORS LAMENTATIONS
THERE GOD DOES LIVE AND GIVES HIS LIGHT AND GIVES HIS HEAT AWAY AND FLOWERS AND TREES AND BEASTS AND MEN RECEIVE COMFORT IN MORNING JOY IN THE NOONDAY
BUT THAT HE CHERISH'D IT WITH MILK AND OIL I NEVER KNEW AND THEREFORE DID I WEEP AND I COMPLAIND IN THE MILD AIR BECAUSE I FADE AWAY
WEEP NOT FOR THE MAID
GAVE THEE CLOTHING OF DELIGHT SOFTEST CLOTHING WOOLLY BRIGHT
THEN IF THOU ART THE FOOD OF WORMS O VIRGIN OF THE SKIES HOW GREAT THY USE HOW GREAT THY BLESSING EVERY THING THAT LIVES
I AM SET TO LIGHT THE GROUND WHILE THE BEETLE GOES HIS ROUND
WHAT CAN IT MEAN
WHERE MERCY LOVE AND PITY DWELL THERE GOD IS DWELLING TOO
TURN AWAY NO MORE
THE VIRGIN STARTED FROM HER SEAT WITH A SHRIEK FLED BACK UNHINDERD TILL SHE CAME INTO THE VALES OF HAR
THE ETERNAL GATES TERRIFIC PORTER LIFTED THE NORTHERN BAR
NURSE'S SONG WHEN THE VOICES OF CHILDREN ARE HEARD ON THE GREEN AND LAUGHING IS HEARD ON THE HILL MY HEART IS AT REST WITHIN MY BREAST AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS STILL
THE CLOUD RECLIND UPON HIS AIRY THRONE AND ANSWERD THUS
SO IF ALL DO THEIR DUTY THEY NEED NOT FEAR HARM
COME AND LICK MY WHITE NECK
OH DO NOT WALK SO FAST
IN WHAT DISTANT DEEPS OR SKIES BURNT THE FIRE OF THINE EYES
AH THEN AT TIMES I DROOPING SIT AND SPEND MANY AN ANXIOUS HOUR
I TOLD IT NOT MY WRATH DID GROW
THEN IN RISING DAY ON THE GRASS THEY PLAY
THE SEXES SPRANG FROM SHAME AND PRIDE BLOWN IN THE MORN IN EVENING DIED
BUT IF THEY RUSH DREADFUL THE ANGELS MOST HEEDFUL RECEIVE EACH MILD SPIRIT NEW WORLDS TO INHERIT
THE TYGER TYGER TYGER BURNING BRIGHT IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT WHAT IMMORTAL HAND OR EYE COULD FRAME THY FEARFUL SYMMETRY
OLD JOHN WITH WHITE HAIR DOES LAUGH AWAY CARE SITTING UNDER THE OAK AMONG THE OLD FOLK
IS THIS A WORM
HEAVEN AND EARTH TO PEACE BEGUILES
WHY A LITTLE CURTAIN OF FLESH ON THE BED OF OUR DESIRE
THEY STRIPPED HIM TO HIS LITTLE SHIRT AND BOUND HIM IN AN IRON CHAIN AND BURNED HIM IN A HOLY PLACE WHERE MANY HAD BEEN BURNED BEFORE
FOR WASHED IN LIFE'S RIVER MY BRIGHT MANE FOR EVER SHALL SHINE LIKE THE GOLD AS I GUARD O'ER THE FOLD SPRING SOUND THE FLUTE
PARENTS WERE AFAR STRANGERS CAME NOT NEAR AND THE MAIDEN SOON FORGOT HER FEAR
SHE BOWD OVER THE WEEPING INFANT AND HER LIFE EXHALD IN MILKY FONDNESS THEN ON THEL SHE FIX'D HER HUMBLE EYES
AND WONDERING BEHOLD A SPIRIT ARMED IN GOLD
THEY VISIT CAVES OF EVERY BEAST TO KEEP THEM ALL FROM HARM
SO I TURNED TO THE GARDEN OF LOVE THAT SO MANY SWEET FLOWERS BORE
IN WHAT FURNACE WAS THY BRAIN
O EARTH O EARTH RETURN
HOW THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER'S CRY EVERY BLACKENING CHURCH APPALLS AND THE HAPLESS SOLDIER'S SIGH RUNS IN BLOOD DOWN PALACE-WALLS
SWEET SMILES IN THE NIGHT HOVER OVER MY DELIGHT
SHE COULD NO FURTHER GO
THEY LAUGH AT OUR PLAY AND SOON THEY ALL SAY SUCH SUCH WERE THE JOYS WHEN WE ALL--GIRLS AND BOYS IN OUR YOUTH-TIME WERE SEEN ON THE ECHOING GREEN TILL THE LITTLE ONES WEARY NO MORE CAN BE MERRY
NEVER NEVER CAN IT BE
NEVER NEVER CAN IT BE
O MAID I TELL THEE WHEN I PASS AWAY
THE FLY LITTLE FLY THY SUMMER'S PLAY MY THOUGHTLESS HAND HAS BRUSHED AWAY
UNSEEN THEY POUR BLESSING AND JOY WITHOUT CEASING ON EACH BUD AND BLOSSOM AND EACH SLEEPING BOSOM
THINK NOT THOU CANST WEEP A TEAR AND THY MAKER IS NOT NEAR
IN THE AGE OF GOLD FREE FROM WINTER'S COLD YOUTH AND MAIDEN BRIGHT TO THE HOLY LIGHT NAKED IN THE SUNNY BEAMS DELIGHT
AND THE ANGEL TOLD TOM IF HE'D BE A GOOD BOY HE'D HAVE GOD FOR HIS FATHER AND NEVER WANT JOY
IN THE MORNING GLAD I SEE MY FOE OUTSTRETCHED BENEATH THE TREE
BUT I SAW A GLOW-WORM NEAR WHO REPLIED WHAT WAILING WIGHT CALLS THE WATCHMAN OF THE NIGHT
COME COME LEAVE OFF PLAY AND LET US AWAY TILL THE MORNING APPEARS IN THE SKIES NO NO LET US PLAY FOR IT IS YET DAY AND WE CANNOT GO TO SLEEP
HE BECOMES AN INFANT SMALL HE BECOMES A MAN OF WOE HE DOTH FEEL THE SORROW TOO
SEVEN NIGHTS THEY SLEEP AMONG SHADOWS DEEP AND DREAM THEY SEE THEIR CHILD STARVED IN DESERT WILD
LOOKST THOU ON MY YOUTH
THOU MOTHER OF MY MORTAL PART WITH CRUELTY DIDST MOULD MY HEART AND WITH FALSE SELF-DECEIVING TEARS DIDST BIND MY NOSTRILS EYES AND EARS DIDST CLOSE MY TONGUE IN SENSELESS CLAY AND ME TO MORTAL LIFE BETRAY
NOW IT'S MUTE
AND PITYING THE TENDER CRIES AND WALKING ROUND THE FOLD
NOTE
I HEARD THY SIGHS
THE INVISIBLE WORM THAT FLIES IN THE NIGHT IN THE HOWLING STORM HAS FOUND OUT THY BED OF CRIMSON JOY AND HIS DARK SECRET LOVE DOES THY LIFE DESTROY
I AM BUT TWO DAYS OLD WHAT SHALL I CALL THEE
IT IS A LAND OF POVERTY
LITTLE LAMB HERE I AM
SHE HAD WANDERED LONG HEARING WILD BIRDS SONG
THE WEEPING PARENTS WEPT IN VAIN
WHERE ARE THY FATHER AND MOTHER
A LITTLE BOY LOST NOUGHT LOVES ANOTHER AS ITSELF NOR VENERATES ANOTHER SO NOR IS IT POSSIBLE TO THOUGHT A GREATER THAN ITSELF TO KNOW
OH THE TREMBLING FEAR
GREY-HEADED BEADLES WALKED BEFORE WITH WANDS AS WHITE AS SNOW TILL INTO THE HIGH DOME OF PAUL'S THEY LIKE THAMES WATERS FLOW
THE SKYLARK AND THRUSH THE BIRDS OF THE BUSH SING LOUDER AROUND TO THE BELLS CHEERFUL SOUND
AND WHEN THY HEART BEGAN TO BEAT WHAT DREAD HAND AND WHAT DREAD FEET
TROUBLED WILDERED AND FORLORN DARK BENIGHTED TRAVEL-WORN OVER MANY A TANGLE SPRAY ALL HEART-BROKE I HEARD HER SAY
AND NOW BESIDE THEE BLEATING LAMB I CAN LIE DOWN AND SLEEP OR THINK ON HIM WHO BORE THY NAME GRAZE AFTER THEE AND WEEP
OH MY CHILDREN
LITTLE WANDERER HIE THEE HOME ON ANOTHER'S SORROW CAN I SEE ANOTHER'S WOE AND NOT BE IN SORROW TOO
THERE'S LITTLE TOM DACRE WHO CRIED WHEN HIS HEAD THAT CURLED LIKE A LAMB'S BACK WAS SHAVED
BREAK THIS HEAVY CHAIN THAT DOES FREEZE MY BONES AROUND
BUT MERCY CHANGED DEATH INTO SLEEP
AND BY CAME AN ANGEL WHO HAD A BRIGHT KEY AND HE OPENED THE COFFINS AND LET THEM ALL FREE
MERRILY MERRILY TO WELCOME IN THE YEAR
MERRILY MERRILY TO WELCOME IN THE YEAR
WHY A NOSTRIL WIDE INHALING TERROR TREMBLING AFFRIGHT WHY A TENDER CURB UPON THE YOUTHFUL BURNING BOY
HE SITS DOWN WITH HIS HOLY FEARS AND WATERS THE GROUND WITH TEARS
THOUGH WRITTEN AND ENGRAVED BY BLAKE A DIVINE IMAGE WAS NEVER INCLUDED IN THE SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND OF EXPERIENCE
AND THE GATES OF THIS CHAPEL WERE SHUT AND THOU SHALT NOT WRIT OVER THE DOOR
SELFISH FATHER OF MEN
III
THE BOOK OF THEL THE AUTHOR PRINTER WILLM
THOU HIS IMAGE EVER SEE HEAVENLY FACE THAT SMILES ON THEE
THEN DOWN A GREEN PLAIN LEAPING LAUGHING THEY RUN AND WASH IN A RIVER AND SHINE IN THE SUN
LOST IN DESERT WILD IS YOUR LITTLE CHILD
THEL ANSWERD O THOU LITTLE VIRGIN OF THE PEACEFUL VALLEY
INFANT SMILES ARE HIS OWN SMILES
BORN BUT TO SMILE FALL
THE CLOUD THEN SHEWD HIS GOLDEN HEAD HIS BRIGHT FORM EMERG'D
HOVERING AND GLITTERING ON THE AIR BEFORE THE FACE OF THEL
AND STANDING ON THE ALTAR HIGH LO WHAT A FIEND IS HERE SAID HE
THE CLOUD DESCENDED AND THE LILY BOWD HER MODEST HEAD
WHILE THE LIONESS LOOSED HER SLENDER DRESS AND NAKED THEY CONVEYED TO CAVES THE SLEEPING MAID
SEEKING TO DRIVE THEIR THIRST AWAY AND KEEP THEM FROM THE SHEEP
POEMS OF WILLIAM BLAKE BY WILLIAM BLAKE SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND OF EXPERIENCE AND THE BOOK OF THEL SONGS OF INNOCENCE INTRODUCTION PIPING DOWN THE VALLEYS WILD PIPING SONGS OF PLEASANT GLEE ON A CLOUD I SAW A CHILD AND HE LAUGHING SAID TO ME
NO NO
AND SO TOM AWOKE AND WE ROSE IN THE DARK AND GOT WITH OUR BAGS AND OUR BRUSHES TO WORK
FOR MERCY PITY PEACE AND LOVE IS GOD OUR FATHER DEAR
AND I PLUCK'D A HOLLOW REED AND I MADE A RURAL PEN AND I STAIN'D THE WATER CLEAR AND I WROTE MY HAPPY SONGS EVERY CHILD MAY JOY TO HEAR
SWEET SLEEP WITH SOFT DOWN WEAVE THY BROWS AN INFANT CROWN SWEET SLEEP ANGEL MILD HOVER O'ER MY HAPPY CHILD
QUEEN OF THE VALES THE MATRON CLAY ANSWERED
CALLING THE LAPSED SOUL AND WEEPING IN THE EVENING DEW
AND THAT I WAS A MAIDEN QUEEN GUARDED BY AN ANGEL MILD
THEN WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH THEE
THEN WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH THEE
LAUGHING SONG WHEN THE GREEN WOODS LAUGH WITH THE VOICE OF JOY AND THE DIMPLING STREAM RUNS LAUGHING BY
AND IT BEARS THE FRUIT OF DECEIT RUDDY AND SWEET TO EAT AND THE RAVEN HIS NEST HAS MADE IN ITS THICKEST SHADE
AND THEN I'LL STAND AND STROKE HIS SILVER HAIR AND BE LIKE HIM AND HE WILL THEN LOVE ME
WILT THOU O QUEEN ENTER MY HOUSE TIS GIVEN THEE TO ENTER AND TO RETURN
AND WENT TO MIND HER NUMEROUS CHARGE AMONG THE VERDANT GRASS
AND I WEPT BOTH DAY AND NIGHT AND HID FROM HIM MY HEART'S DELIGHT
IN HIS ARMS HE BORE HER ARMED WITH SORROW SORE
TIRED WITH KISSES SWEET THEY AGREE TO MEET WHEN THE SILENT SLEEP WAVES O'ER HEAVEN'S DEEP AND THE WEARY TIRED WANDERERS WEEP
FEAR NOTHING ENTER WITH THY VIRGIN FEET
IF MY MOTHER SLEEP LYCA SHALL NOT WEEP
THEN CHERISH PITY LEST YOU DRIVE AN ANGEL FROM YOUR DOOR
WHEN WOLVES AND TIGERS HOWL FOR PREY THEY PITYING STAND AND WEEP
A POISON TREE I WAS ANGRY WITH MY FRIEND
BUT HIS LOVING LOOK LIKE THE HOLY BOOK ALL HER TENDER LIMBS WITH TERROR SHOOK
AND BECAUSE I AM HAPPY AND DANCE AND SING THEY THINK THEY HAVE DONE ME NO INJURY AND ARE GONE TO PRAISE GOD AND HIS PRIEST AND KING WHO MAKE UP A HEAVEN OF OUR MISERY NURSE'S SONG WHEN VOICES OF CHILDREN ARE HEARD ON THE GREEN AND WHISPERINGS ARE IN THE DALE THE DAYS OF MY YOUTH RISE FRESH IN MY MIND MY FACE TURNS GREEN AND PALE
WHAT DREAD GRASP DARE ITS DEADLY TERRORS CLASP
THE BLOSSOM MERRY MERRY SPARROW
SING THY SONGS OF HAPPY CHEER SO I SANG THE SAME AGAIN WHILE HE WEPT WITH JOY TO HEAR
DO THEY CRY DO THEY HEAR THEIR FATHER SIGH
THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER A LITTLE BLACK THING IN THE SNOW CRYING WEEP
BECAUSE I WAS HAPPY UPON THE HEATH AND SMILED AMONG THE WINTER'S SNOW THEY CLOTHED ME IN THE CLOTHES OF DEATH AND TAUGHT ME TO SING THE NOTES OF WOE
THEN NAKED AND WHITE ALL THEIR BAGS LEFT BEHIND THEY RISE UPON CLOUDS AND SPORT IN THE WIND
BESIDES I CAN TELL WHERE I AM USED WELL
WHAT THE ANVIL
LEOPARDS TIGERS PLAY ROUND HER AS SHE LAY
I WAS ARMED HE CAME IN VAIN
HE IS WATCHING WHILE THEY ARE IN PEACE FOR THEY KNOW WHEN THEIR SHEPHERD IS NIGH
PRETTY PRETTY ROBIN
WEEPING O'ER I HEAR THE FATHER OF THE ANCIENT MEN
SWEET BABE IN THY FACE HOLY IMAGE I CAN TRACE
WHOSE EARS HAVE HEARD THE HOLY WORD THAT WALKED AMONG THE ANCIENT TREE
THE SHEPHERD HOW SWEET IS THE SHEPHERD'S SWEET LOT
FOR THE TIME OF YOUTH WAS FLED AND GREY HAIRS WERE ON MY HEAD
BUT HOW THIS IS SWEET MAID I KNOW NOT AND I CANNOT KNOW I PONDER AND I CANNOT PONDER
SWEET JOY BEFALL THEE
SWEET BABE ONCE LIKE THEE THY MAKER LAY AND WEPT FOR ME
RISING FROM UNREST THE TREMBLING WOMAN PRESSED WITH FEET OF WEARY WOE
AND WE ARE PUT ON EARTH A LITTLE SPACE THAT WE MAY LEARN TO BEAR THE BEAMS OF LOVE AND THESE BLACK BODIES AND THIS SUNBURNT FACE IS BUT A CLOUD AND LIKE A SHADY GROVE
DOST THOU O LITTLE CLOUD
NOW THEY LOOK ABROAD TO SEE NOW RETURN AND WEEP FOR ME PITYING I DROPPED A TEAR
HE KISSED THE CHILD AND BY THE HAND LED AND TO HIS MOTHER BROUGHT WHO IN SORROW PALE THROUGH THE LONELY DALE THE LITTLE BOY WEEPING SOUGHT
THE SEXES ROSE TO WORK AND WEEP
INFANT SORROW MY MOTHER GROANED MY FATHER WEPT
FOR MERCY HAS A HUMAN HEART PITY A HUMAN FACE
HOW CAN A CHILD WHEN FEARS ANNOY BUT DROOP HIS TENDER WING AND FORGET HIS YOUTHFUL SPRING
ONE WHO SETS REASON UP FOR JUDGE OF OUR MOST HOLY MYSTERY THE WEEPING CHILD COULD NOT BE HEARD THE WEEPING PARENTS WEPT IN VAIN
SEEKING AFTER THAT SWEET GOLDEN CLIME WHERE THE TRAVELLER'S JOURNEY IS DONE
AND I WATERED IT IN FEARS NIGHT AND MORNING WITH MY TEARS AND I SUNNED IT WITH SMILES AND WITH SOFT DECEITFUL WILES
IN THE SOUTHERN CLIME WHERE THE SUMMER'S PRIME NEVER FADES AWAY LOVELY LYCA LAY
THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND ALL THE NIGHT IN WOE LYCA'S PARENTS GO OVER VALLEYS DEEP WHILE THE DESERTS WEEP
LITTLE LAMB GOD BLESS THEE
LITTLE LAMB GOD BLESS THEE
LONDON I WANDERED THROUGH EACH CHARTERED STREET NEAR WHERE THE CHARTERED THAMES DOES FLOW A MARK IN EVERY FACE I MEET MARKS OF WEAKNESS MARKS OF WOE
AND ALL THY MOANS FLEW O'ER MY ROOF BUT I HAVE CALL'D THEM DOWN
CAN WISDOM BE PUT IN A SILVER ROD
THEN HE GAMBOLLED ROUND O'ER THE HALLOWED GROUND
I LOVE YOU LIKE THE LITTLE BIRD THAT PICKS UP CRUMBS AROUND THE DOOR THE PRIEST SAT BY AND HEARD THE CHILD
SWEET MOANS DOVELIKE SIGHS CHASE NOT SLUMBER FROM THINE EYES
THEY STUMBLE ALL NIGHT OVER BONES OF THE DEAD
AND MERCY PITY PEACE AND LOVE IS MAN HIS CHILD AND CARE
AND WISH TO LEAD OTHERS WHEN THEY SHOULD BE LED
NOW LIKE A MIGHTY WILD THEY RAISE TO HEAVEN THE VOICE OF SONG OR LIKE HARMONIOUS THUNDERINGS THE SEATS OF HEAVEN AMONG
HOW MANY HAVE FALLEN THERE
THE POOR PARSONS WITH WIND LIKE A BLOWN BLADDER SWELL
TO THIS DAY THEY DWELL IN A LONELY DELL NOR FEAR THE WOLVISH HOWL NOR THE LION'S GROWL
I DRIED MY TEARS AND ARMED MY FEARS WITH TEN-THOUSAND SHIELDS AND SPEARS
HOW CAN LYCA SLEEP IF HER MOTHER WEEP
BUT THEIR FEARS ALLAY WHEN HE LICKS THEIR HANDS AND SILENT BY THEM STANDS
INTO THE DANGEROUS WORLD I LEAPT HELPLESS NAKED PIPING LOUD LIKE A FIEND HID IN A CLOUD
AND LOVE THE HUMAN FORM DIVINE
HOW CAN THE BIRD THAT IS BORN FOR JOY SIT IN A CAGE AND SING
OR LOVE IN A GOLDEN BOWL
HE IS CALLED BY THY NAME FOR HE CALLS HIMSELF A LAMB HE IS MEEK AND HE IS MILD HE BECAME A LITTLE CHILD
TYGER TYGER BURNING BRIGHT IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT WHAT IMMORTAL HAND OR EYE DARE FRAME THY FEARFUL SYMMETRY
I FEAR THAT I AM NOT LIKE THEE
THOUGH THE MORNING WAS COLD TOM WAS HAPPY AND WARM
THE MOON LIKE A FLOWER IN HEAVEN'S HIGH BOWER WITH SILENT DELIGHT SITS AND SMILES ON THE NIGHT
SLEEP SLEEP HAPPY SLEEP WHILE O'ER THEE DOTH MOTHER WEEP
NOR IN MY BOOK CAN I TAKE DELIGHT NOR SIT IN LEARNING'S BOWER WORN THROUGH WITH THE DREARY SHOWER
THE STARRY FLOOR THE WATERY SHORE ARE GIVEN THEE TILL THE BREAK OF DAY EARTH'S ANSWER EARTH RAISED UP HER HEAD FROM THE DARKNESS DREAD AND DREAR HER LIGHT FLED STONY DREAD AND HER LOCKS COVERED WITH GREY DESPAIR
THAT MIGHT CONTROL THE STARRY POLE AND FALLEN FALLEN LIGHT RENEW
I KNEW NOT THIS AND THEREFORE DID I WEEP
DOST THOU KNOW WHO MADE THEE
O VIRGIN KNOW'ST THOU NOT OUR STEEDS DRINK OF THE GOLDEN SPRINGS WHERE LUVAH DOTH RENEW HIS HORSES
TERROR THE HUMAN FORM DIVINE AND SECRESY THE HUMAN DRESS
FAREWELL GREEN FIELDS AND HAPPY GROVE WHERE FLOCKS HAVE TA'EN DELIGHT
ARISE FROM OUT THE DEWY GRASS
FROM THE MORN TO THE EVENING HE STAYS
IN MY PALACE DEEP LYCA LIES ASLEEP THEN THEY FOLLOWED WHERE THE VISION LED AND SAW THEIR SLEEPING CHILD AMONG TIGERS WILD
PALE THROUGH PATHLESS WAYS THE FANCIED IMAGE STRAYS FAMISHED WEEPING WEAK WITH HOLLOW PITEOUS SHRIEK
SWEET DREAMS OF PLEASANT STREAMS BY HAPPY SILENT MOONY BEAMS
NEVER CAN IT BE
NEVER CAN IT BE
APPENDIX A DIVINE IMAGE CRUELTY HAS A HUMAN HEART AND JEALOUSY A HUMAN FACE
THEN THE PARSON MIGHT PREACH AND DRINK AND SING AND WE'D BE AS HAPPY AS BIRDS IN THE SPRING
FROWNING FROWNING NIGHT O'ER THIS DESERT BRIGHT LET THY MOON ARISE WHILE I CLOSE MY EYES SLEEPING LYCA LAY WHILE THE BEASTS OF PREY COME FROM CAVERNS DEEP VIEWED THE MAID ASLEEP
THEN EVERY MAN OF EVERY CLIME THAT PRAYS IN HIS DISTRESS PRAYS TO THE HUMAN FORM DIVINE
DROP THY PIPE THY HAPPY PIPE
DOES SPRING HIDE ITS JOY WHEN BUDS AND BLOSSOMS GROW
HE SHALL FOLLOW HIS SHEEP ALL THE DAY AND HIS TONGUE SHALL BE FILLED WITH PRAISE
THE VOICE OF THE ANCIENT BARD YOUTH OF DELIGHT
SOON MY ANGEL CAME AGAIN
SHE IN PALENESS SOUGHT THE SECRET AIR
BUT MOST THROUGH MIDNIGHT STREETS I HEAR HOW THE YOUTHFUL HARLOT'S CURSE BLASTS THE NEW-BORN INFANT'S TEAR AND BLIGHTS WITH PLAGUES THE MARRIAGE-HEARSE
WHEN THE AIR DOES LAUGH WITH OUR MERRY WIT AND THE GREEN HILL LAUGHS WITH THE NOISE OF IT
ROUND THE LAPS OF THEIR MOTHERS MANY SISTERS AND BROTHERS LIKE BIRDS IN THEIR NEST ARE READY FOR REST AND SPORT NO MORE SEEN ON THE DARKENING GREEN
THE MIRE WAS DEEP AND THE CHILD DID WEEP AND AWAY THE VAPOUR FLEW
MY PRETTY ROSE TREE A FLOWER WAS OFFERED TO ME SUCH A FLOWER AS MAY NEVER BORE
LITTLE BOY FULL OF JOY
SEVEN SUMMERS OLD LOVELY LYCA TOLD
THE ANGEL I DREAMT A DREAM
THE HUMAN DRESS IS FORGED IRON THE HUMAN FORM A FIERY FORGE THE HUMAN FACE A FURNACE SEALED THE HUMAN HEART ITS HUNGRY GORGE
WEEP SO YOUR CHIMNEYS I SWEEP AND IN SOOT I SLEEP
WHEN THE STARS THREW DOWN THEIR SPEARS AND WATERED HEAVEN WITH THEIR TEARS DID HE SMILE HIS WORK TO SEE
SWEET MOAN SWEETER SMILE ALL THE DOVELIKE MOANS BEGUILE
AND PRIESTS IN BLACK GOWNS WERE WALKING THEIR ROUNDS AND BINDING WITH BRIARS MY JOYS AND DESIRES
PIPER PIPE THAT SONG AGAIN SO I PIPED
FOR I DANCE AND DRINK AND SING TILL SOME BLIND HAND SHALL BRUSH MY WING
I HEARD AMONG THE RUSHES DANK WEEPING WEEPING
SWEET SLEEP COME TO ME UNDERNEATH THIS TREE
WAITING OFT BESIDE THE DEWY GRAVE SHE STOOD IN SILENCE LISTNING TO THE VOICES OF THE GROUND TILL TO HER OWN GRAVE PLOT SHE CAME THERE SHE SAT DOWN
1780 THEL I THE DAUGHTERS OF MNE SERAPHIM LED ROUND THEIR SUNNY FLOCKS ALL BUT THE YOUNGEST
WHILE OUR SPORTS SHALL BE SEEN ON THE ECHOING GREEN
OH NO
OR HOW SHALL WE GATHER WHAT GRIEFS DESTROY OR BLESS THE MELLOWING YEAR WHEN THE BLASTS OF WINTER APPEAR
TANGLED ROOTS PERPLEX HER WAYS
BUT THEL DELIGHTS IN THESE NO MORE BECAUSE I FADE AWAY AND ALL SHALL SAY WITHOUT A USE THIS SHINING WOMEN LIV'D OR DID SHE ONLY LIVE TO BE AT DEATH THE FOOD OF WORMS
DOES THE SOWER SOW BY NIGHT OR THE PLOWMAN IN DARKNESS PLOUGH
CAN I SEE A FALLING TEAR AND NOT FEEL MY SORROW'S SHARE
STRUGGLING IN MY FATHER'S HANDS STRIVING AGAINST MY SWADDLING-BANDS BOUND AND WEARY I THOUGHT BEST TO SULK UPON MY MOTHER'S BREAST
THEN COME HOME MY CHILDREN THE SUN IS GONE DOWN AND THE DEWS OF NIGHT ARISE
THEN COME HOME MY CHILDREN THE SUN IS GONE DOWN AND THE DEWS OF NIGHT ARISE
CAN DELIGHT CHAINED IN NIGHT THE VIRGINS OF YOUTH AND MORNING BEAR
THE LAMB LITTLE LAMB WHO MADE THEE DOST THOU KNOW WHO MADE THEE GAVE THEE LIFE AND BID THEE FEED BY THE STREAM AND O'ER THE MEAD
DID HE WHO MADE THE LAMB MAKE THEE
MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME UNDERNEATH A TREE AND SITTING DOWN BEFORE THE HEAT OF DAY SHE TOOK ME ON HER LAP AND KISSED ME AND POINTED TO THE EAST BEGAN TO SAY
SAY THEY ARE BOTH GONE UP TO THE CHURCH TO PRAY
AM NOT I A FLY LIKE THEE
FOR WHEN OUR SOULS HAVE LEARN'D THE HEAT TO BEAR THE CLOUD WILL VANISH WE SHALL HEAR HIS VOICE SAYING COME OUT FROM THE GROVE MY LOVE AND CARE AND ROUND MY GOLDEN TENT LIKE LAMBS REJOICE THUS DID MY MOTHER SAY AND KISSED ME
IT IS ETERNAL WINTER THERE
WHAT THE CHAIN
AND THERE THE LION'S RUDDY EYES SHALL FLOW WITH TEARS OF GOLD
THE MERRY BELLS RING TO WELCOME THE SPRING
I WAS ANGRY WITH MY FOE
AND IF THE TENDER PLANTS ARE STRIPPED OF THEIR JOY IN THE SPRINGING DAY BY SORROW AND CARE'S DISMAY HOW SHALL THE SUMMER ARISE IN JOY OR THE SUMMER FRUITS APPEAR
INFANT JOY I HAVE NO NAME
ART THOU A WORM
THEN THEL ASTONISH'D VIEW'D THE WORM UPON ITS DEWY BED
I WENT TO THE GARDEN OF LOVE AND SAW WHAT I NEVER HAD SEEN
UNDER LEAVES SO GREEN A HAPPY BLOSSOM SEES YOU SWIFT AS ARROW SEEK YOUR CRADLE NARROW NEAR MY BOSOM
A LAND OF SORROWS OF TEARS WHERE NEVER SMILE WAS SEEN
I SEE THEE LIKE AN INFANT WRAPPED IN THE LILLYS LEAF
SLEEP SLEEP HAPPY CHILD
ALL CREATION SLEPT AND SMILED
THE GODS OF THE EARTH AND SEA SOUGHT THROUGH NATURE TO FIND THIS TREE BUT THEIR SEARCH WAS ALL IN VAIN
DOUBT IS FLED AND CLOUDS OF REASON DARK DISPUTES AND ARTFUL TEAZING
THE KINGLY LION STOOD AND THE VIRGIN VIEWED
OR WILT THOU GO ASK THE MOLE
COME LIVE AND BE MERRY AND JOIN WITH ME TO SING THE SWEET CHORUS OF HA HA HE A SONG SWEET DREAMS FORM A SHADE O'ER MY LOVELY INFANT'S HEAD
BUT I FEED NOT THE LITTLE FLOWERS
HOLY THURSDAY TWAS ON A HOLY THURSDAY THEIR INNOCENT FACES CLEAN CAME CHILDREN WALKING TWO AND TWO IN READ AND BLUE AND GREEN
WHEN THE MEADOWS LAUGH WITH LIVELY GREEN AND THE GRASSHOPPER LAUGHS IN THE MERRY SCENE WHEN MARY AND SUSAN AND EMILY WITH THEIR SWEET ROUND MOUTHS SING HA HA HE WHEN THE PAINTED BIRDS LAUGH IN THE SHADE WHERE OUR TABLE WITH CHERRIES AND NUTS IS SPREAD
WHY CANNOT THE EAR BE CLOSED TO ITS OWN DESTRUCTION
SPEAK FATHER SPEAK TO YOUR LITTLE BOY OR ELSE I SHALL BE LOST THE NIGHT WAS DARK NO FATHER WAS THERE THE CHILD WAS WET WITH DEW
BENEATH THEM SIT THE AGED MAN WISE GUARDIANS OF THE POOR
AND MUTUAL FEAR BRINGS PEACE TILL THE SELFISH LOVES INCREASE
BESIDES IN THE SKY THE LITTLE BIRDS FLY AND THE HILLS ARE ALL COVERED WITH SHEEP WELL WELL GO AND PLAY TILL THE LIGHT FADES AWAY AND THEN GO HOME TO BED THE LITTLE ONES LEAPED AND SHOUTED AND LAUGHED AND ALL THE HILLS ECHOED
WILLIAM BLAKE'S THE BOOK OF THEL THEL'S MOTTO DOES THE EAGLE KNOW WHAT IS IN THE PIT
NIGHT THE SUN DESCENDING IN THE WEST THE EVENING STAR DOES SHINE
I A CHILD AND THOU A LAMB WE ARE CALLED BY HIS NAME
MY BOSOM OF ITSELF IS COLD AND OF ITSELF IS DARK BUT HE THAT LOVES THE LOWLY POURS HIS OIL UPON MY HEAD AND KISSES ME AND BINDS HIS NUPTIAL BANDS AROUND MY BREAST
THEN THE MORN BLUSHED ROSY RED
THE SICK ROSE O ROSE THOU ART SICK
THE ECHOING GREEN THE SUN DOES ARISE AND MAKE HAPPY THE SKIES
THERE GROWS ONE IN THE HUMAN BRAIN
IF THOUGHT IS LIFE AND STRENGTH AND BREATH AND THE WANT OF THOUGHT IS DEATH
AND CAN HE WHO SMILES ON ALL HEAR THE WREN WITH SORROWS SMALL HEAR THE SMALL BIRD'S GRIEF AND CARE HEAR THE WOES THAT INFANTS BEAR AND NOT SIT BESIDE THE NEXT POURING PITY IN THEIR BREAST AND NOT SIT THE CRADLE NEAR WEEPING TEAR ON INFANT'S TEAR
AND THEY TOLD ME HOW THEY WERE BEGUILED DRIVEN OUT AND COMPELLED TO THE CHASTE
THE CLOD OF CLAY HEARD THE WORMS VOICE RAIS'D HER PITYING HEAD
TILL OUR GRIEF IS FLED AN GONE HE DOTH SIT BY US AND MOAN
THE DAUGHTER OF BEAUTY WIP'D HER PITYING TEARS WITH HER WHITE VEIL AND SAID ALAS
OH THE DISMAL CARE THAT SHAKES THE BLOSSOMS OF MY HOARY HAIR THE SCHOOLBOY I LOVE TO RISE ON A SUMMER MORN WHEN BIRDS ARE SINGING ON EVERY TREE
WHICH THOU DOST SCATTER ON EVERY LITTLE BLADE OF GRASS THAT SPRINGS REVIVES THE MILKED COW TAMES THE FIRE-BREATHING STEED
THE DEATH OF JESUS SET ME FREE
TO HER FATHER WHITE CAME THE MAIDEN BRIGHT
COCK DOES CROW SO DO YOU
WHITE AS AN ANGEL IS THE ENGLISH CHILD BUT I AM BLACK AS IF BEREAVED OF LIGHT
WHEN I FROM BLACK AND HE FROM WHITE CLOUD FREE AND ROUND THE TENT OF GOD LIKE LAMBS WE JOY I'LL SHADE HIM FROM THE HEAT TILL HE CAN BEAR TO LEAN IN JOY UPON OUR FATHER'S KNEE
CAN I SEE ANOTHER'S GRIEF AND NOT SEEK FOR KIND RELIEF
MERRY VOICE INFANT NOISE
II
WEPT FOR ME FOR THEE FOR ALL WHEN HE WAS AN INFANT SMALL
SOON SPREADS THE DISMAL SHADE OF MYSTERY OVER HIS HEAD AND THE CATERPILLAR AND FLY FEED ON THE MYSTERY
AND SO MANY CHILDREN POOR
A LITTLE GIRL LOST CHILDREN OF THE FUTURE AGE READING THIS INDIGNANT PAGE KNOW THAT IN A FORMER TIME LOVE SWEET LOVE WAS THOUGHT A CRIME
PIPE A SONG ABOUT A LAMB SO I PIPED WITH MERRY CHEER
OH WHAT SWEET COMPANY
FOLLOW ME HE SAID
THEN AM I A HAPPY FLY IF I LIVE OR IF I DIE
NIGHT IS WORN AND THE MORN RISES FROM THE SLUMBROUS MASS
AND THEIR SON DOES NEVER SHINE AND THEIR FIELDS ARE BLEAK AND BARE AND THEIR WAYS ARE FILLED WITH THORNS
O BEAUTY OF THE VALES OF HAR WE LIVE NOT FOR OURSELVES THOU SEEST ME THE MEANEST THING AND SO I AM INDEED
PRETTY JOY
THEN I WENT TO THE HEATH AND THE WILD TO THE THISTLES AND THORNS OF THE WASTE
TIRED AND WOE-BEGONE HOARSE WITH MAKING MOAN ARM IN ARM SEVEN DAYS THEY TRACED THE DESERT WAYS
WHILE THE LION OLD BOWED HIS MANE OF GOLD AND HER BREAST DID LICK AND UPON HER NECK FROM HIS EYES OF FLAME RUBY TEARS THERE CAME
THE LILY THE MODEST ROSE PUTS FORTH A THORN THE HUMBLE SHEEP A THREAT'NING HORN
SHE SAW THE COUCHES OF THE DEAD WHERE THE FIBROUS ROOTS OF EVERY HEART ON EARTH INFIXES DEEP ITS RESTLESS TWISTS
UNDER LEAVES SO GREEN A HAPPY BLOSSOM HEARS YOU SOBBING SOBBING PRETTY PRETTY ROBIN NEAR MY BOSOM
THE HUMAN ABSTRACT PITY WOULD BE NO MORE IF WE DID NOT MAKE SOMEBODY POOR AND MERCY NO MORE COULD BE IF ALL WERE AS HAPPY AS WE
ARE SUCH THING DONE ON ALBION'S SHORE
THE LITTLE GIRL LOST IN FUTURITY I PROPHETIC SEE THAT THE EARTH FROM SLEEP GRAVE THE SENTENCE DEEP SHALL ARISE AND SEEK FOR HER MAKER MEEK
AND HEARD THIS VOICE OF SORROW BREATHED FROM THE HOLLOW PIT
AND MODEST DAME LURCH WHO IS ALWAYS AT CHURCH WOULD NOT HAVE BANDY CHILDREN NOR FASTING NOR BIRCH
CAN A MOTHER SIT AND HEAR AN INFANT GROAN AN INFANT FEAR
AND WHAT SHOULDER AND WHAT ART COULD TWIST THE SINEWS OF THY HEART
SMILES ON THEE ON ME ON ALL WHO BECAME AN INFANT SMALL
NOTHING REMAINS
FOR I WALK THROUGH THE VALES OF HAR AND SMELL THE SWEETEST FLOWERS
ONA PALE AND WEAK TO THY FATHER SPEAK
QUEEN OF THE VALES THE LILY ANSWERED ASK THE TENDER CLOUD AND IT SHALL TELL THEE WHY IT GLITTERS IN THE MORNING SKY
IN EVERY CRY OF EVERY MAN IN EVERY INFANT'S CRY OF FEAR IN EVERY VOICE IN EVERY BAN THE MIND-FORGED MANACLES I HEAR
SEATED IN COMPANIES THEY SIT WITH RADIANCE ALL THEIR OWN
BUT TO GO TO SCHOOL IN A SUMMER MORN OH IT DRIVES ALL JOY AWAY
BUT MY ROSE TURNED AWAY WITH JEALOUSY AND HER THORNS WERE MY ONLY DELIGHT
