THE TREE WAS TO BE SET UP IN THE PROVISION ROOM
NOW DON'T SAY NO MAMMY SHE SAID ALARMED FOR SHE SAW A NO SLOWLY COMING IN THE EYES ABOVE HER AS MRS PEPPER BEGAN TO SHAKE HER HEAD
OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE INDEED HE REPEATED IRRITABLY AS HE STOOD WITH ONE GLOVED HAND RESTING ON THE BALUSTRADE

AND THEN SITTING DOWN ON IT HE LEANED ON HER COMFORTABLE LAP IN ORDER TO HEAR BETTER
BETTER WAIT TILL TO-MORROW
THAT WON'T BRING HER SAID POLLY
BUT POLLY DIDN'T COME
SHE HAD GOT MAMMY AND SHE MEANT TO IMPROVE THE PRIVILEGE
I FORGOT TO SAY THAT I HAD A COLD TO HERE JASPER HAD EVIDENTLY HAD A STRUGGLE IN HIS MIND WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE TWO O'S OR ONE AND HE HAD AT LAST DECIDED IT BY CROSSING OUT ONE BUT MY FATHER IS WILLING I SHOULD COME WHEN I GET WELL
WAS PRINCE ON THE STAIRS DICK ASKED JASPER COMING UP AND PEERING UNDER HIS SEVERAL ADORNMENTS
BUT POLLY SEEMED AS BRIGHT AND HEALTHY AS EVER AS SHE JUMPED UP AND RAN TO PUT THE KETTLE ON THE STOVE
THE STAND OF FLOWERS WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST LOVELY
THE CHILDREN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN DESPAIR
AND SHE MUSTN'T HAVE ANY MORE
WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT THE CUPBOARD ASKED MRS PEPPER WHO CAUGHT JOE'S LAST WORD
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL JOEY'S GOING TO GET WELL SUNSHINE AGAIN BUT AS JOEL WAS SMITTEN DOWN SUDDENLY SO HE CAME UP QUICKLY AND HIS HEARTY NATURE ASSERTED ITSELF BY RAPID STRIDES TOWARD RETURNING HEALTH
OH DEAR THOUGHT PHRONSIE THERE'S SUCH A MANY BIG PEOPLE AND THEN THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ANYTHING ELSE BUT TO STUMBLE IN AND OUT TO KEEP FROM BEING CRUSHED COMPLETELY BENEATH THEIR FEET
AND I'LL HANG THEM EVERY ONE UP YES I WILL SAID VAN
HE LIVES MILES AND MILES AWAY--OH EVER SO FAR DOES HE LIVE AS FAR AS THE MOON ASKED LITTLE PHRONSIE CAREFULLY LAYING SERAPHINA DOWN AND LOOKING UP AT POLLY ANXIOUSLY

TWON'T TAKE ME BUT A MINUTE MAMSIE
I WISH WE COULD HAVE--OH

AND POLLY HAD TO KEEP HER PROMISE AND GO TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS AND CALL--"MERRY CHRISTMAS
YOU BETTER BELIEVE I CAN VAN WHITNEY COME OUT IN THE BACK YARD AND TRY THEN SAID VAN HOSPITABLY PERFECTLY DELIGHTED AT THE PROSPECT AND FLYING ALONE TOWARDS THE DOOR
IN TIME FOR MAMSIE'S BIRTHDAY AND HE CAST A SORROWFUL GLANCE AT POLLY
OH OH OH MAMSIE THAT WAS ALL POLLY COULD SAY
AND POLLY MADE THE LOVELIEST OF PAPER DOLLS FOR PHRONSIE OUT OF THE REST OF THE BITS OF BRIGHT PAPER
HAVEN'T ANY RAISINS ECHOED GRANDMA LOOKING AT HER OVER HER SPECTACLES
THEN DEAR SAID MRS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER
AND NOTHING WOULD DO BUT THEY MUST ONE AND ALL BE TOLD THE REASON
SHE'LL GUESS IF YOU DO BUT MRS PEPPER WAS SO UTTERLY ENGROSSED WITH HER BABY WHEN SHE CAME HOME AND HEARD THE ACCOUNT OF THE ACCIDENT THAT SHE WOULDN'T HAVE GUESSED IF THERE'D BEEN A DOZEN CAKES IN THE CUPBOARD

THAT DOLLAR'S THE LORD'S MRS PEPPER LOOKED BEWILDERED AND STILL SAT HOLDING IT OUT
PRINCE AND I WERE OUT FOR A STROLL SAID HE
HE DIDN'T HAVE HARDLY ANY TIME AND WHY NOT ASKED PERCY
HE WAS A HOMELY LITTLE FRENCHMAN WITH A LONG CURVED NOSE AND AN ENORMOUS BLACK MOUSTACHE MAGNIFICENTLY WAXED WHO BOWED ELABORATELY AND CALLED HER MADEMOISELLE PEP-PAIRE BUT HE HAD MUSIC IN HIS SOUL AND POLLY COULDN'T REVERENCE HIM TOO MUCH
FOR JASPER
I'LL TELL YOU--YOU WAIT TILL I PUT PHRONSIE INTO THE CRIB AND THEN I'LL COME BACK AND GO HALF-WAY UP THE STAIRS WITH YOU I WON'T NEVER COME DOWN TILL IT'S MORNIN AGAIN SAID JOEL BOUNCING ALONG THE STAIRS WHEN POLLY WAS READY TO GO WITH HIM AT A GREAT RATE
I CAN'T BEAR IT AND OVER WENT HER HEAD ON THE MUSIC RACK
YES WE GO TO-MORROW HE SAID LOOKING AROUND ON THE GROUP TO WHOM THIS WAS A BLOW THEY LITTLE EXPECTED
I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT
WHY CRIED PHRONSIE IT'S A STOVE--DON'T YOU KNOW POLLY BUT POLLY GAVE ONE PLUNGE ACROSS THE ROOM AND BEFORE ANYBODY COULD THINK SHE WAS DOWN ON HER KNEES WITH HER ARMS FLUNG RIGHT AROUND THE BIG BLACK THING AND LAUGHING AND CRYING OVER IT ALL IN THE SAME BREATH
BUT THE OTHER SPRANG LIKE A CAT AND INTERCEPTED THE BLOW
WHY CAN'T WE MAMMY BETTER BE GLAD YOU'VE GOT THAT JOE SAID MRS PEPPER TAKING ANOTHER COLD POTATO AND SPRINKLING ON A LITTLE SALT
AND THIS IS PRINCE HE ADDED

WHY WE'VE GOT A TREE REPLIED BEN HOPEFULLY
DEAR DEAR SAID POLLY PINCHING BEN TO KEEP STILL AS THEY TUMBLED DOWN THE LITTLE RICKETY STEPS TO THE PROVISION ROOM AFTER BREAKFAST
FOR POLLY WANTED EVERYTHING JUST RIGHT AND WAS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THINGS
THERE THERE TIS SAID BEN
YES'M SAID POLLY WILD TO BE OFF
AND THEY ALL GATHERED AROUND HER WONDERING AND EXAMINING TILL BEN THOUGHT HE WOULD GO WILD WITH THE DELAY
IT'S ALL PLAIN SEW-IN JUST LIKE A BAG
COME ON DAVE WHAT'D YOU CHOOSE LITTLE DAVIE HAD BEEN QUIETLY EATING HIS BREAKFAST AMID ALL THIS CHATTER AND SOMEHOW THINKING IT MIGHT MAKE THE MOTHER FEEL BADLY HE HAD REFRAINED FROM SAYING JUST HOW TIRESOME HE HAD REALLY FOUND THIS EVERLASTING BREAKFAST AS JOEL CALLED IT
HERE THEY ARE NOW OH DEAR SAID JOEL COMING IN CROSSLY I'M SO HUNGRY--OH--BUTTER
UP TO THE OLD-FASHIONED GREEN DOOR WITH ITS BRASS KNOCKER POLLY WENT RUNNING OVER IN HER MIND JUST WHICH OF THE MESSAGES SHE OUGHT TO GIVE FIRST
AND THERE STOOD PHRONSIE SURROUNDED BY THE PALE GROUP
OH NO SHE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING POLLY DON'T AND WHAT DOES POLLY WANT MOST OF ALL--DO YOU KNOW
NOT ONE JOE
IF YOU COULD WAIT TILL BEN GETS HOME SAID MRS PEPPER SLOWLY
BEN DOUBLED UP THE REINS TO GIVE HIM A CUT WHEN WHOA HE ROARED SO LOUD THAT THE HORSE IN VERY ASTONISHMENT GAVE A LURCH THAT NEARLY FLUNG HIM HEADLONG
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD TIMES WE HAD--DOES SHE POLLY AND THEN HE LAUNCHED OUT INTO A PERFECT SHOWER OF DON'T YOU REMEMBER THIS OR OH POLLY
DON'T FORGET THAT AND POLLY RAN DOWN THE STEPS TO THE CARRIAGE DOOR WHERE SHE GAZED UP IMPLORINGLY TO THE BOY'S FACE
I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY'S GOT SUCH CHILDREN AS I HAVE SHE SAID
DO BE STILL DICK POLLY SAT UP VERY STRAIGHT AND WHISKED OFF THE TEARS QUICKLY
THERE NOW SAID MRS WHITNEY SMILING OVER AT MRS PEPPER WHO WAS SMILING AT HER
OH VAN HOW COULD YOU BOTH CONTESTANTS TURNED AROUND SUDDENLY
WELL JASPER MY BOY I GUESS I SHALL HAVE TO DRIVE OVER AND SEE YOUR LITTLE GIRL SINCE SHE'S BEEN POLITE ENOUGH TO BAKE ME THIS POINTING TO THE WILD-LOOKING GINGERBREAD BOY COME IN AND TELL EM ABOUT IT CRIED BEN RADIANTLY PICKING UP HIS POTATOES AND SALT
I SHOULD THINK SHE WAS THE SUNLIGHT THROUGH AN ORIEL WINDOW FELL ON THE CHILDISH FACE AND FIGURE GLINTING THE YELLOW HAIR AND LIGHTING UP THE RADIANT FACE THAT YET HAD A TENDER LOVING GLANCE FOR THE TWO WHO WAITED FOR HER BELOW
WHILE JASPER SHOWING UNMISTAKABLE SYMPTOMS OF PITCHING INTO ALL THE THREE BOYS FOLLOWED WITH THE BAG
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE GREW VERY SOBER AND LOOKED INTENTLY AT THE FOOT THRUST OUT STRAIGHT BEFORE HER AS SHE STILL SAT IN THE CHAIR
THE MEASLES THE MEASLES HAS SHE SAID GRANDMA
THEN I DON'T CARE CRIED JOEL WIPING OFF THE LAST TEAR ON THE BACK OF HIS CHUBBY HAND
IT WAS JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE TWILIGHT
OH SAID POLLY
OH SAID POLLY
TISN'T HERE OH NO IT ISN'T SHE SIGHED AT LAST AND GETTING UP SHE STOOD STILL A MOMENT LOST IN THOUGHT
DO POLLY CRIED JOEL AND THEN LEAVE ONE OR TWO OVER NO SAID POLLY
BUT JOE'S GETTING BETTER NOW AND HE MUST LEARN TO SPARE YOU I DON'T WANT TO SPARE FOLKS GRUMBLED JOEL WHITTLING AWAY WITH ENERGY
OH I AIN'T A-GOIN BACK ALONE EITHER WHIMPERED JOEL COMING UP TO POLLY TOO
WOULD YOU HAVE EM ALL LIKE THAT JOE EVERY ONE REPLIED JOE PROMPTLY
AND PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH A BUNCH OF DRY HERBS WHICH DANGLED COMFORTINGLY BY HIS SIDE AS HE CAME IN
AIN'T YOU HAPPY MAMMY FOR THE LAND'S SAKES CRIED MRS PEPPER STRAINING POLLY TO HER HEART WHATEVER HAS THAT WOMAN--WHATEVER COULD SHE HAVE SAID TO YOU
LET'S BEGIN AGAIN VAN WE MUSTN'T SAID VAN READILY GIVING UP THE CHARMING PROSPECT AND BEGINNING TO EDGE QUICKLY TOWARDS THE HOUSE
OH YOU ARE THE DEAREST AND BEST MR KING I EVER SAW
WHAT DOES IT SAY GASPED MRS PEPPER
SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE POLLY PEPPER BUT POLLY DIDN'T HEAR
FOR AS MRS WHITNEY WAS ABOUT RETIRING THAT EVENING MR KING RAPPED AT HER DOOR ON HIS WAY TO BED
NEVER NEVER NEVER
AND THERE'S MY PET HE CRIED IN ENTHUSIASM AND REACHING OVER THE TABLE HE CAUGHT HOLD OF ONE OF THE LITTLE FAT HANDS
TO THINK YOU KNOW
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE HE'LL GET SHOES TO FIT HIMSELF AND JOE AND DAVIE IN ONE AFTERNOON
SPLENDID SHE CRIED HEARTILY
WHERE IS POLLY I KNOW WHERE SHE IS SAID JOEL
AND NOW IT WAS DECIDED THAT POLLY WAS REALLY TO GO
I WISH THERE WASN'T SUCH A THING AS SHOES IN THE WORLD AND SHE GAVE A FLOUNCE AND SAT UP STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HER MOTHER
I'M SO GLAD
ACCORDINGLY THOMAS WAS DRAGGED FROM HIS WORK TO POST THE LETTER WHILE THE OLD GENTLEMAN OCCUPIED THE TIME IN PULLING OUT HIS WATCH EVERY THIRD SECOND UNTIL THE SLIGHTLY-OUT-OF-BREATH THOMAS REPORTED ON HIS RETURN THAT THE LETTER DID GET IN
POOR THINGS SHE WOULD SAY TO HERSELF THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANY BRINGING UP
AND LITTLE MRS BEEBE COMING IN FOUND HER THUS
OH PHRONSIE SHE CRIED AND STRAINED HER TO HER HEART
IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING OH DEAR SAID LITTLE PHRONSIE CATCHING JOEL'S TONE IT ISN'T NICE
YES YOU CAN SAID BEN
PHRONSIE LAID DOWN THE NOTE OF INVITATION SHE WAS SCRIBBLING AND STOPPED TO THINK
AND WHEN POLLY'S AROUND AGAIN WITH HER TWO EYES ALL RIGHT--WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE SHALL DO I DECLARE BOO CRIED A VOICE NEXT MORNING CLOSE TO POLLY'S ELBOW UNMISTAKABLY JOEL'S
SO NOBODY HEARD EXCEPT A FAT OLD BLACK SPIDER IN THE CORNER AND HE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE
IF BEN COULD ONLY HAVE ONE SO FINE
THERE THAT'S DONE NOW MAMSIE DEAR AND SHE PUT THE COAT WITH A LAST LITTLE PAT INTO HER MOTHER'S LAP
NOT FOR THE WORLD POLLY
THAT'S GIRLS WORK
MAMMY I WANT TO GET UP OH DEAR NO
AND SHE FOUND HERSELF BACK AGAIN IN THE OLD ROCKING-CHAIR AND LISTENING TO THE DOCTOR'S WORDS WHICH WERE QUITE STERN AND DECISIVE
ALL THREE OF THEM I HAVEN'T SAID JOEL COMING IN IN HOPES THAT GRANDMA HAD A STRAY PEPPERMINT OR TWO IN HER POCKET AS SHE SOMETIMES DID
YOU PUT YOURS UP THE OTHER SIDE DAVE HE ADVISED
THEY'RE REAL GOOD SAID JOEL WHO HAD AN UNDEFINED WISH TO COMFORT
THAT IS--ALL BUT AND SHE DASHED OFF FOR PHRONSIE'S EATING APRON
JOEL SAID POLLY AFTER THE MOTHER HAD GONE I DO WISH YOU COULD READ TO ME WELL I CAN'T SAID JOEL GLAD HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW
AND BECOMING HIS OWN GAY KINDLY SELF HE EXPLAINED AND TOLD TO PHRONSIE AND THE OTHERS SO MANY STORIES OF PAST CHRISTMASES HE HAD ENJOYED THAT THE INTEREST OVER THE BAKING SOON DWINDLED AWAY UNTIL A HORRIBLE SMELL OF SOMETHING BURNING BROUGHT THEM ALL TO THEIR SENSES
BUT WE MUST SOME WAY PHOH
AND THEN SHE GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND THOUGHT NO MORE OF IT BECAUSE POLLY HAD SAID THAT ALL WOULD BE RIGHT
WELL HE WOULD HAVE HAD REPLIED POLLY IF THERE'D BEEN BUGS ENOUGH
BUT IT'S FOR YOU TO BEAR PATIENTLY POLLY--WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THE CHICKS WERE DOING WHEN I CAME AWAY AND MRS HENDERSON WHILE SHE HELD POLLY'S HAND SMILED AND NODDED ENCOURAGINGLY TO PHRONSIE WHO WAS STARING AT HER FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED
I TOLD YOU SO CRIED BEN AND POLLY PERFECTLY DELIGHTED TO FIND THEIR FRIEND VINDICATED FULLY--"THERE
BUT ALL EFFORTS TO FIND THIS PARTICULAR ONE FAILED UTTERLY
NO EGGS NOR OH I COULDN'T HAVE EGGS CRIED POLLY IN AMAZEMENT AT THE THOUGHT OF SUCH LUXURY
YOU'RE GETTING ON SO FINELY YOU'LL BE AS SMART AS A CRICKET
I DON'T CARE

LET'S GO BACK WAS ALL THEY HEARD
WE COULDN'T GO ANY FURTHER FOR THE POOR LITTLE THING WAS ALL TIRED OUT
WELL MAMSIE'LL KNOW WHERE BEN IS HE SAID SPRINGING UP
AND STAGE COACH TOO--"ANYTHING TO MAKE A NOISE BEN SAID
AND SO THE EVENING PASSED RAPIDLY AND HAPPILY AWAY
THE BIGGER YOU ARE THE MORE MISCHIEF YOU CAN GET INTO
IT CAME FROM MR KING
BUT TO GO BACK--WHEN I WAS A LITTLE SHAVER ABOUT AS BIG AS PERCY HERE OH PAPA BEGAN PERCY DEPRECATINGLY

YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHRISTMAS WELL I WISH SAID JOEL I HAD MY NAME ON MINE
CAUSE THEN POLLY'LL CRY AND THAT WILL MAKE HER EYES VERY BAD
I'VE NEVER BEEN SICK
I MOST KNOW HE IS AND HE BENT DOWN TO EXAMINE THE POSITION OF JASPER'S HEELS
THAT IS BECAUSE YOU WERE HELPING VAN SO LONG LAST EVENING OVER HIS LESSONS SAID MRS WHITNEY
ABOUT HALF-PAST TWO LONG AFTER DINNER JOE CAME WALKING IN HUNGRY AS A BEAVER BUT FLUSHED AND TRIUMPHANT
HERE'S ONE POLLY OH DEAR GROANED BEN
WHAT'LL WE DO FOR AN ENVELOPE HE ASKED IN DISMAY
I'VE GOT TO GO UPSTAIRS NOW SO POLLY LAUNCHED OUT INTO SUCH AN EXTRAVAGANT STORY THAT THEY ALL PERFORCE HAD TO LISTEN
WILL SOMEBODY HAVE THE EXTREME GOODNESS TO TELL US WHAT ALL THIS MEANS AT THIS THE LITTLE PEPPERS CROWDED AROUND THEIR MOTHER AND INTO ALL THE VACANT PLACES THEY COULD FIND TO GET NEAR THE FASCINATING SCENE
AND THE ONE WHO SEES EM FIRST CAN ASK FIRST IS MAMSIE COMING ALL RIGHT CRIED THE BOYS
AND WHEN AS THEY LEFT THE TABLE AT LAST LITTLE DICK RUSHED IMPULSIVELY UP TO POLLY AND FLINGING HIMSELF INTO HER ARMS DECLARED I LOVE YOU!--AND YOU'RE MY SISTER NOTHING MORE WAS NEEDED TO MAKE POLLY FEEL AT HOME
WHEN THERE WAS A LULL IN THE GALE SHE TOOK POLLY'S HAND AND LED HER TO A LITTLE STAND OF FLOWERS IN THE CORNER CONCEALED BY A SHEET--PINKS AND GERANIUMS HELIOTROPES AND ROSES BLOOMING AWAY AND NODDING THEIR PRETTY HEADS AT THE HAPPY SIGHT--POLLY HAD HER FLOWERS
MAY I HAVE SOMETHIN TO EAT MA YES SAID MRS PEPPER

WHAT'S THE MATTER GASPED POLLY

SO THE CANDY WAS HANDED IN TO PHRONSIE WHO INSISTED THAT POLLY SHOULD HOLD HER UP TO THE WINDOW TO THANK MR BEEBE
GRANDPAPA WANTS TO PUT IT ON--THERE AS MR KING DROPPED IT SCIENTIFICALLY ON HIS HEAD AND THEN PROCEEDED TO PASTE ANOTHER ONE OVER HIS LEFT EYE
I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF THERE JAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY
THICK AS YOU CAN AND DETERMINED TO DO NOTHING BY HALVES JOEL RAN GENEROUSLY FOR THE PRECIOUS HOWL OF RAISINS AND AFTER SETTING IT ON THE TABLE BEGAN TO HELP POLLY IN ALL NEEDFUL PREPARATIONS

BEAUTIFUL RED TOPS AREN'T THEY BE-YEW-TI-FUL SANG THE CHILD DELIGHTEDLY
DR FISHER'D HAVE OUR EARS OFF WELL I CAN HEAR ANY WAY SAID POLLY RESIGNING HERSELF TO THE REMAINING COMFORT
AND THEN IT HAD TO BE DRAWN OUT AND DRESSED ANEW WITH THE FLOWERS FOR THEY HAD DECIDED TO HAVE IT ON THE BREAKFAST TABLE
I KNOW JASPER'D COME IF HE COULD MRS PEPPER WISELY KEPT HER OWN COUNSEL SIMPLY GIVING THEM A KINDLY CAUTION
WHAT IS IT SIR THE PAPER SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN IRRITABLY
THEY'VE JUST SCRAMBLED UP AND THEN SHE WOULD SET HER LIPS TOGETHER TIGHTLY AND FLY AT HER WORK FASTER THAN EVER
IT'S TURNING BLACK AND QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE POLLY TWITCHED IT OUT WITH ENERGY AND SET IT ON THE TABLE
BUT ON JASPER'S SUGGESTING THAT THEY SHOULD ALL DO SOMETHING TO GET READY FOR THE VISITORS AND HAVE A GENERAL TRIMMING UP WITH VINES AND FLOWERS BESIDE--THE TIME PASSED AWAY MUCH MORE RAPIDLY THAN WAS FEARED
AND ALL THOSE MESSAGES
AND PRINCE AND I ARE SO LONELY ON OUR WALKS--DO PERMIT ME FATHER THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO REALLY CARED VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT TURNED AWAY MUTTERING WELL I'M SURE I DON'T CARE
I'M POLLY AND THEN SHE BLUSHED BRIGHT AS A ROSE AND THE LAUGHING BROWN EYES LOOKED BEYOND TO JASPER WHO STOOD ON THE WALK AND SMILED ENCOURAGINGLY
BUT--"WELL IT'LL COME SOME TIME SHE WOULD SAY TO HERSELF
OH HE SAID POPPING IN HIS HEAD IN RESPONSE TO HER INVITATION TO COME IN IT'S NOTHING--ONLY I THOUGHT I'D JUST TELL YOU A WORD OR TWO ABOUT WHAT I'VE DECIDED TO DO DO YOU MEAN WHAT YOU WANTED TO SEE ME ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON ASKED MRS WHITNEY WHO HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT SINCE
THAT'S CERTAIN I'LL RUN RIGHT DOWN TO FLETCHER'S AND GET IT CRIED POLLY
BARK
AND THEN COMING BACK SHE TOOK UP HER LITTLE STUBBY PENCIL AND BENDING OVER A SMALL BIT OF PAPER SHE COMMENCED TO TRACE WITH LABORIOUS EFFORTS AND MUCH HARD BREATHING SOME VERY QUEER HIEROGLYPHICS THAT TO HER SEEMED TO BE ADMIRABLE AS AT LAST SHE HELD THEM UP WITH GREAT SATISFACTION
JAPPY USED TO BAKE CRIED LITTLE DAVIE
OH MAMMY'S PRETTY WELL SHOUTED POLLY INTO THE OLD LADY'S EAR
AT THAT VERY DOOR AND THEN SHE WENT INTO THE DINING-ROOM TO HER WORK
BUT WHEN HE CAME TO POLLY SHE DIDN'T ANSWER
ALL OTHER FRONT DOORS IN BADGERTOWN WERE ORNAMENTS ONLY OPENED ON GRAND OCCASIONS LIKE A WEDDING OR A FUNERAL
OH POLLY JOEY'S DRE-AD-FUL SICK HE IS SHE JUMPED RIGHT UP AND TORE OFF THE BANDAGE
BUT HE SAYS HE'S COMING TO SEE THE LITTLE GIRL THAT BAKED IT FOR HIM BEFORE WE GO HOME BEN NEARLY TUMBLED OVER BY THE SIDE OF JASPER AT THESE WORDS--"COMING TO SEE US HE GASPED
I GUESS SHE MEANS PRINCE SAID JOEL
YES SAID BEN JUST TWICE AS FAST I'M GOING THEN SAID JOEL
I'LL DO SOMETHING SAID POLLY HER BROWN EYES KINDLING OR I SHAN'T BE WORTHY OF YOU MAMMY O YOU'LL DO IT SAID MRS PEPPER CONFIDENTLY NOW THAT YOU'RE GOING BUT WHEN POLLY STEPPED INTO THE STAGE WITH HER LITTLE HAIR TRUNK STRAPPED ON BEHIND CONTAINING HER ONE BROWN MERINO THAT MRS HENDERSON HAD MADE OVER FOR HER OUT OF ONE OF HER OWN AND HER TWO NEW GINGHAMS HER COURAGE FAILED AGAIN AND SHE ASTONISHED EVERYBODY AND NEARLY UPSET A MILD-FACED OLD LADY WHO WAS IN THE CORNER PLACIDLY EATING DOUGHNUTS BY SPRINGING OUT AND RUSHING UP THROUGH THE LITTLE BROWN GATE PAST ALL THE FAMILY DRAWN UP TO SEE HER OFF
AND NICE INSIDE TOO AND THEN HE GLANCED OVER TO HIS MOTHER WHO GAVE HIM A SMILE IN RETURN
SO JOEL REPEATED HIS QUESTION BEFORE POLLY COULD STOP HIM
TO BE SURE CRIED THE OLD LADY DELIGHTED BEYOND MEASURE TO GIVE ADVICE
THE DOOR WAS THROWN SUDDENLY OPEN AND JASPER PLUNGED IN HIS FACE FLUSHED WITH EXCITEMENT AND AFTER HIM BEN LOOKING A LITTLE AS HE DID WHEN PHRONSIE WAS LOST WHILE PRINCE SQUEEZED PANTING IN BETWEEN THE TWO BOYS
THEY'RE MILES AWAY IF THEY'VE BEEN GONE HALF AN HOUR

I DON'T KNOW HOW HE FOUND OUT YOU WANTED ONE SO BAD

PSHAW DICK
HERE LAY A LITTLE BUNDLE ON THE GROUND AND CLOSE BY IT A BIG BLACK DOG
WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT ALL THIS MEANS
THEN HE SAID IT CAN'T BE FOR HER MR ATKINS
BUT HE MERELY SAID
PHRONSIE WAS PLAYING IN THE CORNER OF MRS WHITNEY'S LITTLE BOUDOIR ENGAGED IN SENDING OUT INVITATIONS FOR AN ELABORATE TEA-PARTY TO BE GIVEN BY ONE OF THE DOLLS WHEN POLLY RUSHED IN WITH CONSTERNATION IN HER TONES AND DISMAY WRITTEN ALL OVER HER FACE
DOES SHE MEAN IT CRIED PERCY IN THE GREATEST EXCITEMENT

ONE LITTLE FOOT WAS POISED JUST IN THE ACT OF STEPPING DOWN TO THE NEXT LOWER STAIR AND THE FAT HAND GRASPED THE POLISHED RAILING EXPRESSIVE OF JUST ENOUGH CAUTION TO MAKE IT TRULY CHILDISH
THE SAME AS BEN'S GOT
AND THE FOUNDATION OF ALL MY ILL FEELINGS THIS WINTER WAS LAID I'M CONVINCED IN HINGHAM LAST SUMMER NO USE TO URGE THE CONTRARY
BUT I WOULDN'T WAKE HER UP YET IF I WERE YOU
AND I'LL GO RIGHT TO WORK ON ONE TO-MORROW
WHAT WILL MAMSIE SAY THE STRANGER AMAZED AT THIS NEW STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS WAS VAINLY TRYING TO HOLD THE UMBRELLA OVER BOTH TILL THE PROCESSION COULD MOVE ON AGAIN
SO MAKE THE MOST OF IT OH SAID POLLY WITH A LONG SIGH
YOU MUSTN'T DANCE ON THE TABLE I'M GOING TO LEARN SAID PHRONSIE COMING OUT OF POLLY'S EMBRACE TO DRAW WHOLE PICTURES ALL ALONE BY MYSELF--BEN SAID SO I KNOW IT SAID POLLY AND THEN YOU SHALL DRAW ONE FOR MAMSIE--YOU SHALL I WILL SAID PHRONSIE DREADFULLY EXCITED
BLESS ME CRIED A THIRD WHIRLING AROUND SUDDENLY BLESS ME
TISN'T ANYTHING TO WHAT I USED TO HAVE TO REMEMBER--WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL NO BIGGER THAN YOU ARE POLLY SIGHED AND FEELING SURE THAT SOMETHING MUST BE THE MATTER WITH HER MIND GAVE HER WHOLE ATTENTION TO THE ERRAND
THE DOUGHNUT LADY VIEWING POOR POLLY WITH EXTREME SYMPATHY IMMEDIATELY FORCED UPON HER ACCEPTANCE THREE OF THE LARGEST AND SUGARIEST
AND MRS PEPPER THANKED HIM WITH A HEART OVERFLOWING WITH GRATITUDE THROUGH LIPS THAT WOULD TREMBLE EVEN THEN FOR ALL THAT JASPER HAD DONE FOR THEM
AND ARE YOU A PEPPER YES SAID BEN LAUGHING TOO
YES SAID MRS WHITNEY AND NODDED TO HERSELF IN THE SAYING IT WAS A GOOD THING
YOU COULD COOK A THANKSGIVING DINNER IN THIS STOVE JUST AS EASY AS NOT SAID JASPER PUTTING INTO THE OVEN SOMETHING ON A LITTLE CRACKED PLATE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PIE IF THERE WERE ANY CENTRE
DON'T YOU PERCY YES SAID THE BOY
THEY DO SOME SUMMERS
LET'S GO BEHIND THE WOOD-PILE SHE SAID TO BEN IN DESPERATION
OH DO STOP
SAY MA
IT'S SO NICE TO HAVE POLLY HERE SISTER HE SAID AND HE PUT HIS HAND ON MRS WHITNEY'S NECK
IT'S MY TURN POLLY SO TIS SAID POLLY
AND THE YOUNGER THREE OF THE FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS AS THEY WERE ALWAYS CALLED LOOKED UP TO THEM WITH THE INTENSEST ADMIRATION AND LOVE
HEY SAID MISS JERUSHA
THE MAN PULLED THE STRING AND STRUCK UP A MERRY TUNE AND IN A MINUTE THE MONKEY SPUN AROUND AND AROUND AT SUCH A LIVELY PACE AND PUT IN SO MANY QUEER ANTICS THAT THE LITTLE AUDIENCE WERE FAIRLY CONVULSED WITH LAUGHTER
BECAUSE IT MUST AND SO AT IT AGAIN SHE WOULD FLY BRISKER THAN EVER
THAT'S RIGHT YOU CAN HAVE AS MUCH BREAD AS YOU WANT TO
A LITTLE DOWN THE ROAD THE MAN STRUCK UP ANOTHER TUNE
NOW CHILDREN SAID POLLY AFTER PHRONSIE HAD MADE THEM TAKE A BITE OF HER CANDY ALL AROUND LET'S GET THE CAKE PUT AWAY SAFE FOR MAMSIE MAY COME HOME EARLY
OH DO COME OUT AND LOOK TISN'T ANY USE SAID JOEL COOLLY SITTING DOWN ON THE CHAIR VAN HAD JUST VACATED AND SWINGING HIS FEET COMFORTABLY
A BIG GIRL LIKE YOU NEVER TO KNIT A STOCKING
WELL I DON'T QUICKLY REPLIED BEN FOR THEN SHE WOULDN'T BE MINE
POLLY WENT SKIPPING AROUND CUTTING THE BREAD AND BRINGING DISHES
AND TWAS NICE ALWAYS WELL SAID VAN RETURNING TO THE PICTURE I DO WISH YOU'D TELL ME HOW TO DRAW BEN
THE BIG DRAWING-ROOM WITH ITS SHADED LIGHT AND DRAPED FURNITURE WITH ITS THICK SOFT CARPET ON WHICH NO FOOT-FALL COULD BE HEARD WITH ALL ITS BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS ON EVERY SIDE WAS NOTHING TO POLLY'S EYES ONLY THE ROOM THAT CONTAINED THE PIANO
AND HAVING THUS SUMMARILY DISPOSED OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS HE MARCHED OUT WITH PHRONSIE ON HIS SHOULDER
I FORGOT
AND WITH A COLD HEAVY FEELING AT HER HEART POLLY REALIZED THAT THIS WAS NO PLAY
ISN'T IT JUST LOVELY--OH MAMMY AND POLLY TURNED SO VERY PALE AND LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOING TO TUMBLE RIGHT OVER THAT MRS PEPPER GRASPED HER ARM IN DISMAY
I HAVE SOME VERY NICE MY SISTER SENT ME AND I WANT YOUR MOTHER TO SHARE IT OH THANK YOU MA'AM CRIED POLLY THINKING HOW GLAD DAVIE'LL BE FOR HE DOES SO LOVE BUTTER
WE AREN'T EVER GOIN TO BE SICK AGAIN EVER--ANY MORE SHE ADDED IMPRESSIVELY
I'LL RUN AND GET IN THE CAR--THEN I'LL BE ALL RIGHT SO SHE WENT ON WITH NIMBLE FOOTSTEPS DODGING THE CROWD AND SOON CAME TO THE CORNER
NOW SAID MRS PEPPER AFTER THE FIRST EXCITEMENT WAS OVER YOU'RE SO COMFORTABLE TOGETHER AND PHRONSIE DON'T WANT ME NOW I'LL GO TO THE STORE
BUT SHE WON'T SAID BEN
AND JASPER SYMPATHIZED AND REJOICED WITH THEM TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT AND ALTOGETHER GOT SO VERY HOME-LIKE THAT THEY ALL FELT AS IF THEY HAD KNOWN HIM FOR A YEAR
OH IS SHE COMING JAPPY
WHY SHE SAID SHE'D MAKE VAN AND ME OUR SAILS YOU KNOW SAID PERCY HOLDING UP A RATHER FORLORN LOOKING SPECIMEN OF A BOAT BUT WHICH THE BOYS HAD CARVED WITH THE GREATEST ENTHUSIASM AND WE WANT HER NOW CAN'T YOU LET HER ALONE TILL SHE'S READY TO COME SAID JASPER QUICKLY
SO THEY ALL HAD TO WHIRL BACK AGAIN AS BEFORE
LET DOGGIE STAY
OH MY SENSES SPRINGING TO POLLY
WHICH DONE SHE FLEW AT THE REST OF HER PREPARATIONS AND TRIED TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
AND THEN I USED TO MAKE JOEL'S AND DAVIE'S AFTERWARDS AND AND WERE THEIRS JUST LIKE THIS ASKED PERCY LAYING HIS HAND ON THE SAIL SHE HAD FINISHED CUTTING OUT
IN AFTER YEARS JASPER NEVER THOUGHT OF PHRONSIE WITHOUT BRINGING UP THIS PICTURE ON THAT APRIL MORNING WHEN POLLY AND HE SAT AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS AND LOOKED UP AND SAW IT
AND DON'T LET MAMSIE FORGET TO CARRY SOME IN TO GOOD OLD MR AND MRS BEEBE IN TOWN--WHERE PHRONSIE GOT HER SHOES YOU KNOW
AND BE QUICK INTERPOLATED WITH SHOWERS OF BLAME ON PRINCE FOR SITTING ON THE STAIRS AND TRIPPING PEOPLE UP
THEN CAME IN THE LOUDEST OF WHISPERS FROM LITTLE DICK OH JAPPY WHAT'LL SHE SAY HUSH SAID ONE OF THE OTHER BOYS
WHY YOU MUST HAVE GONE UP A MILLION TIMES
BUT ON POLLY TELLING HIM IT MUST BE HIS OWN HE STOPPED HIS SEARCH AND BRINGING DOWN HIS WELL-WORN ONE HUNG IT BY THE CORNER OF THE CHIMNEY TO BE READY
AND PERHAPS HE COULD HAVE PITCHED INTO THE BURGLARS FINISHED VAN IGNORING THE INVITATION AND TUMBLING INTO HIS JACKET WITH ALARMING SPEED
YOU'RE RIGHT IN ALL THE SLUSH--MOTHER WON'T LIKE IT I TELL YOU HUSH CRIED POLLY CATCHING HIS ARM HE'S COME--OH JOEL--HE'S COME WHO CRIED JOEL STARING AROUND BLINDLY WHO POLLY POLLY HAD JUST OPENED HER LIPS TO EXPLAIN WHEN MR KING'S PORTLY HANDSOME FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
AND DON'T YOU THINK THEY LIVE OVER IN BADGERTOWN AND WELL SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN PAUSING IN HIS WALK AND TAKING OUT HIS WATCH TO WONDER IF THAT PAPER WOULD EVER COME SHE HAD PROBABLY FOLLOWED THE ORGAN-MAN
POLLY WAS SO OUT OF BREATH THAT SHE COULDN'T SPEAK
IN A MOMENT PHRONSIE WAS PERCHED UPON OLD MR KING'S KNEE AND PLAYING WITH HIS WATCH
DO TELL US SO THE FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS AND JASPER FLEW OFF INTO REMINISCENCES AND ACCOUNTS OF THE FUNNY DOINGS AND MRS PEPPER JOINED IN HEARTILY TILL THE ROOM GOT VERY MERRY WITH THE GLEE AND ENTHUSIASM CALLED FORTH
I'M NO END SORRY I MADE SUCH A MESS OF IT HE SAID I MEANT IT FOR YOU TISN'T ANY MATTER SAID POLLY KINDLY
AND I'LL RUN RIGHT ALONG HOME AND GET IT AND SHE STARTED TO GO
GRANDMA WAS SWEEPING UP THE FLOOR ALREADY AS NEAT AS A PIN
AND ONE AND ALL VOTED HIM A MOST CHARMING COMPANION
AND THEN MR KING CAME IN AND TOOK JASPER OFF WITH HIM
AND SO ON THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON IT TURNED OUT THAT THE PEPPERS ABOUT WHOSE COMING THERE HAD BEEN SO MANY PLANS AND EXPECTATIONS JUST WALKED IN AS IF THEY HAD ALWAYS LIVED THERE
YOU HAVEN'T GOT TO THAT YET WHEN'S IT COMING ASKED JOEL WHO WAS DECIDEDLY OF A MATTER-OF-FACT TURN OF MIND
I'LL BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING
LITTLE PHRONSIE SLEPT ALL THAT NIGHT STRAIGHT THROUGH
YOU ALWAYS DO THINK OF THE VERY BEST THINGS BUT JOEL PHOOHED AND DECLARED HE WOULDN'T WASTE HIS TIME OVER OLD BEEF
WELL THEN YOU DO IT AND I'LL TAKE SOMETHING ELSE
OH LET ME TELL HER HE STRUGGLED TO GET DOWN FROM HIS FATHER'S ARMS AS HE SAID THIS
SHE'LL ROLL OVER AND MUSS IT THOUGHT POLLY
BUT IT'S TOO GOOD
AND SO THE SAILS WERE CUT OUT AND THE HEMS TURNED DOWN AND BASTED AND TUCKED AWAY INTO POLLY'S LITTLE WORK-BASKET READY FOR THE SEWING ON THE MORROW
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN HE ASKED TURNING AROUND TO GREET THE BOY WHO CAME IN FOLLOWED BY PRINCE
I'VE GOT SOME PEPPERMINTS TO HOME
AND THAT MADE SAD HAVOC IN THE QUARTERS AND HALF-DOLLARS LAID UP AS HER NEST EGG
TO HAVE IT BRIGHT AND WINSOME AND WARM
THIS IS YOUR HOME CHILDREN HE SAID WAVING HIS HAND AT THE FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS IN A BUNCH
I WON'T--ONLY--I CAN'T THANK YOU PHRONSIE SAID JASPER QUICKLY WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE PRINCE SAID THE OTHER DAY WHAT ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE
AND A BIG DROP OF INK FALLING FROM THE PEN HE SPATTERED THE J SO THAT NO ONE COULD TELL WHAT IT WAS
YES SAY I MAY BEN DO YOU'RE TOO LITTLE BEGAN PERCY
THE GENTLEMAN'S FACE LOOKED VERY QUEER JUST THEN
WHAT A DUST YOU'VE KICKED UP
THAT'S THE WAY
THE MEASLES
HOH HOH HOH HOH ECHOED DICK
WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE OH CRIED THE CHILDREN RAPTUROUSLY
WE WEREN'T GLAD TO HEAR HE WAS SICK CRIED BEN IN HORROR
JAPPY SAID SO EVERYTHING'S COMING SAID LITTLE DICK TUMBLING UP THE STEPS--"AND THE BIRD--AND--AND AND MAMSIE FINISHED PHRONSIE IMPATIENT TO ADD HER PART--WHILE POLLY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING--ONLY LOOKED
WHY PERCY I DIDN'T KNOW AS YOU HAD THOUGHT OF THAT HE SAID KINDLY
FANCY BEN GOING ROUND WITH ONE OF THOSE AWFUL LITTLE THINGS WHISPERED JAPPY TO POLLY WHO SHOOK AT THE VERY THOUGHT
HOW MANY'D YOU HAVE POLLY ASKED JOEL CURIOUSLY LAYING DOWN HIS HAMMER AND REGARDING HER WITH THE UTMOST ANXIETY
AND HERE IS MRS PEPPER SAID OLD MR KING POMPOUSLY DRAWING HER FORWARD THE CHILDREN'S MOTHER AND BUT HERE MRS PEPPER BEGAN TO ACT IN A VERY QUEER WAY RUBBING HER EYES AND TWISTING ONE CORNER OF HER BLACK APRON IN A DECIDEDLY NERVOUS MANNER THAT AS THE OLD GENTLEMAN LOOKED UP HE SAW WITH ASTONISHMENT PRESENTLY COMMUNICATED ITSELF TO THE GENTLEMAN OPPOSITE
THEN YOU WON'T BE TIRED PERHAPS OH I'M NOT VERY TIRED NOW SAID POLLY BRIGHTLY WITH A MERRY LITTLE LAUGH ONLY I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THE CARS BEFORE AND NEVER BEEN IN THE CARS BEFORE EXCLAIMED VAN CROWDING UP WHILE PERCY MADE A BIG ROUND O WITH HIS MOUTH AND LITTLE DICK'S EYES STRETCHED TO THEIR WIDEST EXTENT
FIVE O'CLOCK
YOU HAVEN'T ANY BUSINESS TO GO AROUND THE COUNTRY SETTING YOUR DOG ON PEOPLE
WE WON'T CRIED BOTH OF THE CHILDREN PERFECTLY OVERWHELMED WITH REMORSE
POSIES I SAID SAYS BETSEY
BETTER CLEAR UP THE DISHES POLLY AND SET THE TABLE BACK--SEVENTY-FIVE WHAT JOEL PLUM-PUDDINGS SAID JOEL KISSING PHRONSIE
IS THIS SHE ASKED TAKING IT ALL IN AT THE FIRST GLANCE--THE BOY WITH THE HONEST EYES AS BEN HAD DESCRIBED HIM--AND THE BIG BLACK DOG--"IS THIS THE BOY WHO SAVED MY LITTLE GIRL OH MA'AM CRIED JASPER I DIDN'T DO MUCH
THIS IS YOUR NEST LITTLE BIRD AND I HOPE YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY IN IT AND HERE MRS WHITNEY TURNED UP THE GAS AND THEN JUST BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T HELP IT GATHERED POLLY UP IN HER ARMS WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
THREAD'S DEAR NOW I COULDN'T HELP IT SAID POLLY VEXEDLY
I WISH BEN WAS HERE SAID LITTLE DAVIE CAPERING AROUND THE WHITNEY GROUP AN JAPPY I DO WHERE ARE THEY ASKED POLLY
AND HE GAVE ME MINE--AND--THAT'S ALL
I HOPE I'LL LIVE THROUGH PLENTY MORE OF THEM HE SAID MERRILY
TO BE CALLED A LITTLE SHAVER BEFORE ALL THE OTHERS
OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD THAT TRIED POLLY'S PATIENCE MOST WERE THE TROUBLESOME LITTLE BLACK BUTTONS THAT ORIGINALLY ADORNED THOSE USEFUL PARTS OF HER CLOTHING AND THAT WERE FONDLY SUPPOSED TO BE THERE WHEN NEEDED
OH SHE COULDN'T HELP IT CRIED MR KING BEGINNING TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE FLOOR AND BEAMING AS HE RECALLED HIS SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY
MINE WAS ROOTS AND LITTLE FLOWERS GROWING HE MEANS WHAT HE GETS IN THE WOODS SAID POLLY EXPLAINING
CHILDREN SHE SAID
AND I'LL FINISH THE MENDING SO MRS PEPPER PUT DOWN HER WORK AND MOVED THE BIG BASKET FOR LITTLE DICK TO CLAMBER UP WHEN HE LAID HIS HEAD CONTENTEDLY BACK IN HER MOTHERLY ARMS WITH A SIGH OF HAPPINESS
GOOD-BYE
WHY
DO AS MOTHER SAYS I'LL TRY AGAIN SAID POOR POLLY CHOKING BACK HER SOBS AND GETTING ON HER FEET
THE OLD THING TIPPED
AND SHE WAS SOON OH-ING AND AH-ING ENOUGH TO SUIT EVEN THEIR DISTRESSED LITTLE SOULS
THE LORD'LL PROVIDE
WELL HERE I AM SHE SAID WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF AS SHE AT LAST REACHED MR FLETCHER'S BIG BIRD STORE
HERE TIS PLAIN ENOUGH AND HE READ WHAT HE HAD NO NEED TO STUDY MUCH AS IT HAD ALREADY PASSED EXAMINATION BY HIS OWN AND HIS WIFE'S FAITHFUL EYES
HER FACE BEGAN TO GET VERY RED AND SHE STRAIGHTENED UP SO SUDDENLY TO SHOW POLLY JUST HOW VERY BIG SHE WAS THAT HER LITTLE HEAD CAME UP AGAINST THE EDGE OF THE TUB--OVER IT WENT
BUT SOMEHOW BEFORE THEY WENT A GOOD MANY THINGS FOUND THEIR WAY OUT OF THE OLD-FASHIONED CHAISE INTO THE PEPPERS LITTLE KITCHEN
WELL SAID JOEL TAKING ANOTHER MOUTHFUL OF BREAD SO I WAITED
ONCE THEY CAME VERY NEAR HAVING THE WHOLE THING POP OUT
NOW I'LL PUT THE BUTTER ON THIS LITTLE BLUE PLATE
AND WE MIGHT MAKE A TREE REAL PRETTY HOW ASKED POLLY ASHAMED OF HER ILL-HUMOR BUT NOT IN THE LEAST SEEING HOW ANYTHING COULD BE MADE OF A TREE
AND NOW DO YOU GO ON CRIED JOEL AND DAVID BOTH IN THE SAME BREATH ALL ABOUT THE TREE YOU KNOW YES YES SAID THE OTHERS
THEN HE TOOK HOLD OF POLLY'S HAND WHO BY THIS TIME WAS GLAD OF A PROTECTOR
SHE WAS VERY GOOD TO SEND THIS I THINK
THEY'RE ALL FLEW AWAY
BUT BE SURE POLLY TO HURRY FOR IT'S GETTING LATE AND I SHALL BE WORRIED ABOUT YOU
I WISH I COULD EVER BAKE AND HE LOOKED LONGINGLY AT THE LITTLE BROWN BISCUITS WAITING THEIR TURN OUT ON THE TABLE
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT WHEN THE CARRIAGE DID COME NOBODY HEARD IT
AND IT ACCOMMODATES ME IMMENSELY
WELL THEN SANG POLLY COME MAMMY WE'LL GO FIRST
OH NO PHRONSIE YOU CAN'T
I THOUGHT HE'D EAT THE LITTLE GIRL UP OUGHT TO HAVE LOOKED OUT FOR HER BETTER THEN GRUMBLED THE OLD GENTLEMAN DETERMINED TO FIND FAULT WITH SOMEBODY
SHE FLUNG HERSELF DOWN BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD BED AND BURIED HER FACE IN THE GAY PATCHED BED-QUILT
OVER THE GROUND SHE SPED ONLY INTENT ON REACHING THE BIRD STORE HER SPEED HEIGHTENED BY THE DARK AND ROLLING BANK OF CLOUD THAT SEEMED TO SHUT RIGHT DOWN SUDDENLY OVER HER AND ENVELOP HER WARNINGLY
I KNOW IT SAID POLLY BUT IT'S JUST LOVELY
AND NOW SAID POLLY AFTER THEY HAD ALL SAT AROUND THE STOVE ANOTHER HALF-HOUR WATCHING AND SNIFFING EXPECTANTLY THE CAKE'S DONE!--DEAR ME
BUT SHE WAS SOON ON THE WAY WITH A LITTLE PAT OF BUTTER IN A BLUE BOWL TIED OVER WITH A CLEAN CLOTH
SO A MOST WONDERFUL STORY DRAWN UP IN BEN'S BEST STYLE FOLLOWED TILL BEDTIME
THERE NOW LET MOTHER SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER OH DEAR SAID POLLY RESIGNING THE NEEDLE WITH A BIG SIGH AND LEANING BACK TO TAKE A GOOD STRETCH FOLLOWED BY PHRONSIE'S SYMPATHIZING EYES
SOMEHOW POLLY COULDN'T SEE VERY WELL
THERE'S A FEW RAISINS FOR YOU POLLY
MAMMY CAN'T I TAKE OFF THIS HORRID BANDAGE AND SEE HIM DEAR ME NO SAID MRS PEPPER SPRINGING FORWARD
HOORAY SCREAMED JOEL AND DAVID TO FILL ANY PAUSE THAT MIGHT OCCUR WHILE PHRONSIE GURGLED AND LAUGHED AT EVERYTHING JUST AS IT CAME ALONG
SO POLLY BEGAN
THERE ISN'T ANY MAMSIE IN THE HOUSE SHE STAMMERED
I WISH THERE WERE FORTY CHRISTMASES COMING I HAVEN'T SCREAMED DAVIE
I WON'T BE SICK SHE SAID
YOU'RE JUST THE SPLENDIDEST GOODEST MAMSIE IN ALL THE WORLD
SO FOR AN HOUR THE SMALL TYRANTS KEPT THEIR ENTERTAINERS WELL EMPLOYED
ALSO A GLASS OF JELLY CRIMSON AND CLEAR
AND SHE HAD SUCH A PRETTY LITTLE YELLOW HEAD
WHEN I WAS GOING DOWN TO PLAY A DUET WITH JASPER
HE ISN'T STRONG BEN SAID DAVID DRAWING A LONG BREATH HIS EYES VERY BIG DID HE REALLY SEE A BEAR NO SAID BEN
WE'RE A-GOIN TO BE READY
WELL IT BEGAN WITH A CON--AND I AM SURE--YES VERY SURE IT WAS CONSEQUENCE THAT MUST BE SPLENDID SAID JOEL COMING UP TO HER CHAIR AND SLOWLY DRAWING A STRING HE HELD IN HIS HAND BACK AND FORTH TO GO TO CONSEQUENCES AND EVERYTHING
SO WITH A GREAT MANY CHUCKLINGS AND SHRUGGINGS WHEN NO ONE WAS BY HE HAD DEPARTED AFTER BREAKFAST ONE DAY SIMPLY SAYING HE SHOULDN'T BE BACK TO LUNCH
AND NOT A CENT OF MONEY TO GET ANY MORE WITH
SO SHE SAT STRAIGHT UP ON HER LITTLE STOOL WINKING LIKE EVERYTHING TO KEEP AWAKE
YOU'D HAD TO HAVE HAD AN EXPRESS WAGON TO CARRY THE LETTERS IF YOU HAD PUT THEM ALL IN AT LAST CRIED JASPER
IT'S MOST A YEAR ISN'T IT BEN TWON'T BE MUCH TIME FOR US SAID BEN WHO THOUGHT OF THE MANY HOURS TO BE DEVOTED TO HARD WORK THAT WOULD RUN AWAY WITH THE TIME
TO BEN WHO TOOK THE HINGHAM ROAD THE MINUTES SEEMED LIKE HOURS
OH JOEY CRIED POLLY LAUGHINGLY MOLASSES CANDY FOR BREAKFAST THAT'S PRIME CRIED JOEL SWALLOWING THE LAST MORSEL
AND YOU MUST STAY AND KEEP HOUSE I'M GOING TO NAIL SAID JOEL
JOEL KEPT THE HOUSE IN A PERFECT UPROAR ALL THROUGH HIS GETTING WELL
AND THEN AFTER SEEING HIM FAIRLY STARTED ON A SMART RUN TO CATCH THE STAGE PRINCE SCAMPERING AT HIS HEELS THEY ALL BEGAN TO SING HIS PRAISES AND TO WISH FOR THURSDAY TO COME
I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE A BIRD FOR MY VERY OWN HULLOA SAID SANTA CLAUS I'VE GOT SOMETHING MYSELF SANTA CLAUS CLOTHES ARE TOO OLD LAUGHED DR FISHER HOLDING UP A STOUT WARM SUIT THAT A BOY ABOUT AS BIG AS BEN WOULD DELIGHT IN
BUT BEN NODDED HIS HEAD AT DICK WHICH CAUSED HIM TO CLAP HIS HANDS AND RETURN TO HIS ORIGINAL POSITION SATISFIED
AND THEN YOU WILL BE A CARE TO YOUR MOTHER ALL YOUR LIFE I SHALL BE BLIND ANYWAY SAID POLLY DESPAIRINGLY
DID HE SWALLOW IT ASKED THE CHILD OBEDIENTLY OPENING HER LITTLE RED LIPS
BEGIN NOW POLLY BEGIN NOW WHY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO BED YET SAID POLLY SO I CAN'T TILL TO-MORROW YES I HAVE--YOU'VE MADE US GO FOR THREE--NO I GUESS FOURTEEN NIGHTS SAID JOEL INDIGNANTLY
SOMETHING WAS GOING DOWN THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S NECK THAT WET HIS COLLAR AND MADE HIM WHISPER VERY TENDERLY IN HER EAR DON'T GIVE WAY NOW POLLY
AND PHRONSIE HUGGED UP COMFORTINGLY TO POLLY'S HEART WHO POURED INTO HER EAR ALL THE LOVING WORDS SHE HAD SO LONGED TO SAY
OH NO DEAR THAT ISN'T IT CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN I'LL TELL YOU
HELP POLLY IN FIRST
I WONDER WHERE IT DID COME FROM SAID POLLY IN THE GREATEST ANXIETY EXAMINING AGAIN THE ADDRESS
HOW SURPRISED THEIR MOTHER APPEARED WHEN SHE WAS USHERED OUT TO THE FEAST AND THE FULL GLORY OF THE TABLE BURST UPON HER
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID--WHAT IS IT A MUSEUM SHOUTED VAN AND IT'S A PERFECTLY ELEGANT PLACE JOEL PEPPER AND PERCY KNOWS I LIKE TO GO
AND OVER THE WHOLE STANDING GUARD WAS A BOY A LITTLE BIGGER THAN BEN WITH HONEST GRAY EYES
BUT THE LAST HOPE HAD TO BE GIVEN UP AS THE OLD CLOCK TICKED AWAY HOUR AFTER HOUR
WELL GO ON CHILDREN SHE SAID
SHE'LL DRUM ON THE TABLE AND ANYWHERE TO MAKE BELIEVE IT'S A PIANO THERE'S DR FISHER GOING BY SAID JOEL WHO NOW THAT THEY HAD GOTTEN ON THE SUBJECT OF MUSIC BEGAN TO FIND PRICKLES RUNNING UP AND DOWN HIS LEGS FROM SITTING SO STILL
THE STOVE'LL ACT LIKE EVERYTHING TO-MORROW
WITH A JOLLY RED FACE AND A PACK ON HIS BACK AND FLEW INTO THEIR MIDST PREPARED TO DO HIS DUTY
ONLY IT'S PRINCE INSTEAD OF ME AND HE PULLED FORWARD THE BIG BLACK CREATURE WHO HAD FOLLOWED FAITHFULLY DOWN THE HILL TO SEE THE LAST OF IT
HOW'D YOU HAVE CAUGHT EM ASKED VAN SCORNFULLY SURVEYING THE SQUARE LITTLE COUNTRY FIGURE BEFORE HIM
EVERYTHING WAS JUST AS STILL AS A MOUSE
I THINK SHE MIGHT FOR SHAME JOE SAID MRS PEPPER
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO AND SHE DROPPED A KISS ON HIS STUBBY BLACK HAIR
YES WE ARE REALLY BENSIE VERY DREADFUL RICH I WISH WE COULD BE RICH NOW THEN SAID BEN TAKING ANOTHER GENEROUS SLICE OF THE BROWN BREAD
JASPER SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND HOWEVER FOR HE SMILED BRIGHTLY AS HE SAID LOOKING INTO THE BROWN EYES I'LL DO IT ALL POLLY
HE'S DONE THE MOST SPLENDID THING YOU EVER SAW
THIS LITTLE GIRL IS GOING TO BE A COMFORT I KNOW AND THEN SHE SET HERSELF TO CONDUCT SUCCESSFULLY HER THREE BOYS INTO FRIENDLINESS AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP WITH POLLY FOR EACH OF THEM WAS FOLLOWING HIS OWN SWEET WILL IN THE CAPACITY OF HOST AND BESIDES STARING AT HER WITH ALL HIS MIGHT WAS DETERMINED TO DO THE WHOLE OF THE ENTERTAINING A STATE OF THINGS WHICH MIGHT BECOME UNPLEASANT
AND NOW THE ACCUMULATION OF DOLLS IN THE HOUSE BECAME SOMETHING ALARMING FOR MR KING OBSERVING PHRONSIE'S DEVOTION TO HER FAMILY THOUGHT THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE TOO MANY OF THEM
HE PULLED HIMSELF UP LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE POLLY A HEARTY WELCOME
THAT'S A MOUSE HE ADDED AS A LITTLE RUSTLING NOISE MADE POLLY STOP WHERE SHE STOOD BACK OF THE TREE AND PRICK UP HER EARS IN GREAT DISTRESS OF MIND
THESE CHILDREN HAVE A LOOK ABOUT THEM THAT SHOWS THEM WORTHY TO BE TRUSTED SO THEY HAVE
PHRONSIE WENT TO SLEEP HAPPY HUGGING BABY AND DON'T YOU THINK BABY DEAR SHE WHISPERED SLEEPILY AND POLLY HEARD HER SAY AS SHE WAS TUCKING HER IN THAT JASPER IS REALLY COMIN
DEAR ME SAID MRS PEPPER WHAT'S THAT IT'S CHERRY SAID POLLY LIFTING UP HER HEAD FROM FASQUELLE AND--OH DEAR ME AND FLINGING DOWN THE PILE OF BOOKS IN HER LAP ON A CHAIR SHE RUSHED ACROSS THE ROOM AND FLEW UP TO THE CAGE AND BEGAN TO WILDLY GESTICULATE AND EXPLAIN AND SHOWER DOWN ON HIM EVERY ENDEARING NAME SHE COULD THINK OF
SHE'S PERFECTLY ACHING TO GO NOW PERCY WHITNEY WELL WHY DON'T SHE THEN SAID PERCY OPENING HIS EYES TO THEIR WIDEST EXTENT

KEEPING HER OWN SECRET MEANWHILE WHICH MADE HER BLOOD LEAP FAST AS THE HAPPY THOUGHTS NESTLED IN HER HEART OF HER LITTLE ONES AND THEIR COMING GLEE
SHE WANTS YOU ALL THE TIME I WILL POLLY SAID DAVIE COMING IN WITH AN ARMFUL OF WOOD IN TIME TO HEAR THE CONVERSATION

DEAR FRIENDS--A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU ALL
EVIDENTLY PRINCE STILL REGARDED HER AS HIS ESPECIAL PROPERTY
THE BUNGLERS SAID JOEL WITH A RED FACE
SO FOR THE NEXT FEW MOMENTS POLLY HAD ALL SHE COULD DO BY WAY OF COMFORTING AND CONSOLING HIM

YOU'VE SPOILED OUR MAMSIE'S BIRTHDAY AND WITHOUT A BIT OF WARNING SHE SAT RIGHT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR AND BEGAN TO CRY AS HARD AS SHE COULD
WHY YOU HAVE JOE SAID BEN
IN VAIN SISTER MARIAN SENT A GENTLE APPEAL FULLY SHOWING HER HEART WAS IN IT
BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING TO PUT IN THEM AND THE WINTERS WERE COLD AND HARD AND THE STRICTEST ECONOMY ONLY CARRIED THEM THROUGH
TWOULDN'T HANGUP THAT'S ALL AND YOU'VE BEEN BUMPING IT SAID POLLY
BUT IF WE SHOULD POP A LOT OH
OH POLLY HE SAID IN SUCH A RINGING VOICE
HERE SHE STEADILY RESISTED ALL TEMPTATIONS TO STOP AND LOOK AT THE NEW ARRIVALS OF BIRDS AND TO FEED THE CARRIER-PIGEONS WHO SEEMED TO BE EXPECTING HER AND WHO TURNED THEIR SOFT EYES UP AT HER REPROACHFULLY WHEN SHE FAILED TO PAY HER RESPECTS TO THEM
THE SQUEEZLES REPEATED JOEL IRRITABLY
WHAT THEY FAILED TO DO COULDN'T VERY WELL BE DONE BY ANY ONE
AND YOU DO FIX THEM SO NICE SHE ADDED SORROWFULLY
JOEL SAID POLLY BE STILL AND YOU'RE VERY IMPERTINENT TOO SAID MISS JERUSHA
LET'S THINK THOUGH
SHE HAD THEN BY MEANS OF A HANDFUL OF SOFT SOAP TAKEN FROM POLLY'S SOAP-BOWL DURING THE DISH-WASHING AND A BIT OF OLD COTTON PLASTERED BOTH HERSELF AND BABY TO A COMFORTABLE DEGREE OF STICKINESS
NO SAID BEN I THINK THE NICEST WAY IS FOR ALL TO SAY SOMETHIN THEN TWON'T BE HARD FOR ANY OF US WHERE'S THE PAPER QUERIED POLLY COMING FROM I WONDER JOEL SAID MRS PEPPER RUN TO THE BUREAU IN THE BEDROOM AND OPEN THE TOP DRAWER AND GET A GREEN BOX THERE SO JOEL QUITE IMPORTANT AT THE ERRAND DEPARTED AND PRESENTLY PUT THE DESIGNATED BOX INTO HIS MOTHER'S HAND

THE GREATER EXCITEMENT COMPLETELY SWALLOWED UP THE LESS
NO I SHA'N'T TELL SAID PERCY WHEN THE FUN HAD SUBSIDED
NO HE DIDN'T BITE ME SAID POLLY
AND SOON A PLEASANT HUM AND BUSTLE WENT ON AROUND THE BAKING TABLE THE CENTRE OF ATTRACTION
FOR MR KING HAVING NOTHING TO DO AND EACH YEAR FINDING HIMSELF LESS INCLINED TO EXERCISE ANY THOUGHTFUL ENERGY FOR OTHERS BEGAN TO LOOK AT LIFE SOMETHING IN THE LIGHT OF A SERIOUS BORE AND ACCORDINGLY MADE IT DECIDEDLY DISAGREEABLE FOR ALL AROUND HIM AND PARTICULARLY FOR JASPER WHO WAS HIS CONSTANT COMPANION
THAT ISN'T NICE MA SHE SAID GLANCING AT THE POOR OLD PAIL WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT OUT OF THE PROVISION ROOM OLD BROWN BREAD
COME ON PRINCE
BEN WILL BRING HER MAMMY
AS SHE WENT BACK INTO HER NEST AFTER ONE OF THESE TRAVELS POLLY THOUGHT
BUT YOU MAY JUST RUN DOWN TO THE PARSON'S AND SEE HOW HE IS IS HE SICK ASKED POLLY IN AWE
NOW THEN HE SWUNG HER UPON HIS SHOULDER WHERE SHE PERCHED LIKE A LITTLE BIRD GRAVELY SURVEYING THE WHOLE GROUP
IN THIS BE-YEW-TI-FUL PLACE
I WASN'T A POOR BOY CRIED JOEL INDIGNANTLY
I WISH YOU KNEW HIM IF FATHER'S SICK AGAIN SAID JASPER WE'LL HAVE HIM--HE LOOKS NICE ANYWAY--FOR FATHER DON'T LIKE THE DOCTOR OVER IN HINGHAM--DO YOU KNOW PERHAPS WE'LL COME AGAIN NEXT SUMMER

S'POSE ANYBODY ELSE HAD EATEN EM UP BEN AND SHE TURNED PALE AT THE VERY THOUGHT
I NEVER HAD A CAKE
NO NOT ONE BIT AND SHE WIPED OFF THE LAST TEAR WITH HER FAT LITTLE HAND AND WATCHED TO SEE WHAT NEXT WAS TO BE DONE
AND WE'LL HAVE A FROLIC IN THE PROVISION ROOM AFTERWARDS FINISHED POLLY
AND BESIDES SHE ALWAYS FINISHED IT SOUNDS NICE COME ON DAVE
THE RAIN THAT WAS FALLING AROUND THEM AS THEY STOOD THERE SENT WITH THE SOUND OF EVERY DROP SUCH A FLOOD OF MISERY INTO POLLY'S HEART
OH DON'T LET EM VAN--DON'T WHY THEY CAN'T SAID VAN IN AN EMPHATIC VOICE RUNNING UP THE STAIRS TO JOEL'S SIDE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH AT HIS TEARS
THEN THEY WERE LESS FREQUENT AND THEY KNEW HE WAS STUDYING HARD
AND POLLY GROWING MORE SILENT AND PALE MOVED AROUND WITH A LITTLE DROOP TO THE SMALL FIGURE THAT HAD ONLY BEEN WONT TO FLY THROUGH THE WIDE HALLS AND SPACIOUS ROOMS WITH GAY AND SPRINGING STEP
IN THE VERY NICK OF TIME IN FACT SO HER MOTHER WAS WILLING ASKED HIS DAUGHTER CURIOUSLY

WE'RE GOING TO SISTER MARIAN'S AGAIN FATHER AND I
MY LIVER CERTAINLY WILL BE IN A DREADFUL STATE IF THESE THINGS CONTINUE AND HE GOT UP AND GOING TO THE CORNER OF THE ROOM OPENED HIS MEDICINE CHEST AND TAKING A BOX OF PILLS THEREFROM HE SWALLOWED TWO WHICH DONE HE CAME BACK WITH A SOMEWHAT EASIER EXPRESSION TO HIS FAVORITE CHAIR
YOU SHOULDN'T CRIED POLLY AND THEN THEY ALL BURST OUT INTO A PEAL OF LAUGHTER AT JASPER'S FUNNY GRIMACES
AND THEN THERE WAS A CLATTER OUT INTO THE HALL
HE TOLD ENOUGH HOWEVER FOR POLLY TO SEE WHAT HAD BEEN SO NEAR THEM
THE BREATHING CAME PEACEFUL AND REGULAR AND WITH HER LITTLE HAND FAST CLASPED IN MRS WHITNEY'S SHE SLEPT ON AND ON
YOU COULDN'T BE ONE
I COULDN'T THINK OF IMPOSING ALL MY CHILDREN ON YOU AND IMPOSING
I KNOW I OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL FOR THAT SHE SAID TO HERSELF NOT TAKING TIME EVEN TO CRY OVER HER TROUBLES

I DON'T GO UNLESS SHE DOES WHERE ARE WE GOING POLLY ASKED PHRONSIE LOOKING BACK LONGINGLY TO HER BELOVED STAIRS AS SHE WAS BORNE OFF
WHY BEN PEPPER I NEVER SAID SO AND SHE LOOKED READY TO CRY
JUST AS EASY AS NOT HE REPEATED WITH EMPHASIS SLAMMING THE DOOR TO GIVE POINT TO HIS REMARKS
AND ONE AND ALL REDOUBLED THEIR EXERTIONS TO MAKE EVERYTHING TWICE AS PLEASANT AS EVER
I TELL YOU THEY CAN'T BITE HE SCREAMED AS LOUD AS HE COULD INTO HIS EAR
WHILE THE BOYS CROWDED AROUND AND PLIED HER WITH SUDDEN QUESTIONS
AND I ALWAYS SUPPOSED SHE HAD GONE TO ENGLAND FOR DESPITE ALL MY EXERTIONS I COULD FIND NO TRACE OF HER
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SPLENDID THE OTHER WAY MAMMY--JUST LIKE OTHER FOLKS YOU MUST MAKE BELIEVE THIS IS LIKE OTHER FOLKS SAID MRS PEPPER CHEERILY WHEN YOU CAN'T DO ANY OTHER WAY YES SAID BEN THAT'S SO POLLY

AND WHILE POLLY FED IT TO HER LISTENED WITH ABSORBED INTEREST TO ALL THE PARTICULARS CONCERNING EACH AND EVERY CHICK IN THE HENDERSON HEN-COOP
AND THIS GIRL TOO LAYING HER HAND ON PHRONSIE'S HEAD
THAT AIN'T THE WAY TO SWEEP AND SHE TOOK THE BROOM OUT OF POLLY'S HAND WHO STOOD QUITE STILL IN MORTIFICATION
TO HAVE POLLY CRY HURT HIM MORE THAN HE CARED TO HAVE PHRONSIE SEE

DON'T LAUGH AT HER BOYS PUT IN POLLY
MORE THAN YOU COULD EAT PHRONSIE JUST CLASPED HER HANDS AND SIGHED

SHE'S CAUGHT HER DEATH-COLD NO DOUBT NO DOUBT OUTSIDE IN THE RAIN THE CHILDREN REVOLVED AROUND AND AROUND POLLY AND PHRONSIE HUGGING AND KISSING THEM UNTIL NOBODY COULD DO MUCH MORE THAN BREATHE NOT SEEMING TO NOTICE THE STRANGER WHO STOOD QUIETLY WAITING TILL SUCH TIME AS HE COULD BE HEARD
PLEASE LET ME POLLY SO POLLY WOULD JUMP AND GIVE HER A KISS AND THEN DELIGHTED TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS THERE WOULD GO AT HER PRACTICING WITH TWICE THE VIGOR AND ENTHUSIASM
WE MIGHT SIGN THEIR NAMES FOR EM SUGGESTED POLLY
THIS BREAD WON'T BE FIT FOR ANYTHING ISN'T THIS FUN THOUGH CRIED JASPER RUNNING UP TO TRY THE OVEN
VAN LET HER OFF OH NO I WON'T
NOT EVEN AFTER THE TEAPOT WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND SHAKEN BY BOTH GRANDMA'S AND POLLY'S ANXIOUS HANDS
WHERE DO YOU LIVE

AND SANTA CLAUS IS COMING RANG BACK AND FORTH THROUGH THE OLD KITCHEN TILL IT SEEMED AS IF THE THREE LITTLE OLD STOCKINGS WOULD HOP DOWN AND JOIN IN THE DANCE GOING ON SO MERRILY
WELL DO GO ON SAID JOEL AS USUAL ROLLING ON THE FLOOR IN A DREADFUL HURRY FOR THE STORY TO BEGIN
JUST AS GOOD AS CAN BE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
AND THEN WHILE PHRONSIE MONOPOLIZED PRINCE JASPER TOLD THEM ALL ABOUT THE RECEPTION OF THE PARCEL--HOW VERY DULL AND FORLORN HE WAS FEELING THAT MORNING PRINCE AND HE SHUT UP IN-DOORS--AND HOW HIS FATHER HAD HAD A MISERABLE NIGHT AND HAD EATEN SCARCELY NO BREAKFAST AND JUST AT THIS JUNCTURE THERE CAME A KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND SAID JASPER YOUR PARCEL WALKED IN ALL DRESSED UP IN FLOWERS THEY WEREN'T OUR FLOWERS SAID POLLY HONESTLY

WELL WHAT IS IT ASKED THE MINISTER ENCOURAGINGLY
OH NO I WANT HER SAID LITTLE DICK
YOU MUSTN'T JOEL CRIED MRS PEPPER IN A FRIGHT RUNNING UP TO HIM AS HE WAS PREPARING TO GIVE THE BEDCLOTHES A LUSTY KICK
THE SEED LAY ALL OVER THE PAVEMENT SCATTERED FAR AND WIDE EVEN OUT TO THE PUDDLES IN THE STREET
I HOPE NOT
AND WHEN THEY SAW HER DARK EYES SHINING WITH SUCH A NEW LIGHT LITTLE DAVIE SKIPPED RIGHT OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME AHEAD TROUBLE FOR THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE OH I DO WISH SAID JOEL A FEW MORNINGS AFTER PUSHING BACK HIS CHAIR AND LOOKING DISCONTENTEDLY AT HIS BOWL OF MUSH AND MOLASSES THAT WE COULD EVER HAVE SOMETHING NEW BESIDES THIS EVERLASTING OLD BREAKFAST
JASPER AND PRINCE FOLLOWED DECOROUSLY
IF YOU'RE VERY HUNGRY YOU CAN EAT BREAD SAID MRS PEPPER SENSIBLY
OH DEAR I SHALL LAUGH
AND THEN AFTER THEY GOT NICELY STARTED IN THE GAME HE WOULD BE MISSING TO HELP ABOUT THE MYSTERIOUS THING IN THE KITCHEN WHICH WAS SAFE SINCE POLLY COULDN'T SEE HIM GO ON ACCOUNT OF HER BANDAGE
MISS JERUSHA STALKED IN ALSO AND SEATED HERSELF BY THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO KNIT
AND HOW LONG AGO OH I DON'T KNOW REPLIED JANE CARELESSLY HALF AN HOUR MAYBE

DEAR MISS POLLY BEGAN BOTH BEN AND POLLY IN A BREATH
BUT NOW HE LOOKED UP EAGERLY HIS ANSWER ALL READY
NOT STOPPING TO LOOK INTO THE PITEOUS BROWN EYES SHE STRODE ON WITHOUT A WORD
AND TO MRS BEEBE'S INTENSE ASTONISHMENT AND DISMAY SHE SPUN ROUND AND ROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR
CAN'T YOU REMEMBER DICKY BOY I PUSHED PRINCEY SAID DICK FEELING WITH FREEDOM FROM SOME OF HIS ENCUMBRANCES MORE DISPOSED FOR CONVERSATION AND MADE HIM GO AHEAD--AND THEN I FELL ON TOP OF HIM--THAT'S ALL I GUESS PRINCE HAS SAVED HIM FATHER CRIED JASPER TURNING AROUND WITH EYES FULL OF PRIDE AND LOVE ON THE DOG WHO WAS TRYING AS HARD AS HE COULD TO TELL ALL THE CHILDREN HOW MUCH HE ENJOYED THEIR CARESSES
AND SINCE THE FATHER DIED WHEN PHRONSIE WAS A BABY MRS PEPPER HAD HAD HARD WORK TO SCRAPE TOGETHER MONEY ENOUGH TO PUT BREAD INTO HER CHILDREN'S MOUTHS AND TO PAY THE RENT OF THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE
WHERE WAS I WHY YOU SAID TOMMY HEARD A NOISE SAID POLLY AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS A BEAR OH YES SAID BEN

AS TRUE AS--TRUTH SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN SOLEMNLY PATTING THE CHILD'S LITTLE FAT HAND
SLOWLY GOING FROM ONE STEP TO THE OTHER DRAWING EACH LITTLE FAT FOOT INTO PLACE LABORIOUSLY BUT WITH A PLEASED EXPRESSION ON HER FACE THAT ONLY GAVE SOME SMALL IDEA OF THE RAPTURE WITHIN
GOOD-BYE SHE SAID THEN GETTING UP AND BOWING TO THE DOLLS WHO SAT AMONG THE INTERRUPTED INVITATIONS I WON'T BE GONE BUT A LITTLE BIT OF ONE MINUTE AND SHE WENT OUT DETERMINEDLY AND SHUT THE DOOR
MRS WHO REPEATED MISS JERUSHA
THERE'S NO TIME TO BE LOST
WHY HE SAVED A LITTLE GIRL FATHER FROM A CROSS OLD ORGAN-MAN AND HE DROVE THAT MAN--OH

POOR LITTLE LAMB SAID MR KING GETTING DOWN TO UNBUTTON THEM
SO LOUD THAT THE OLD LADY'S CAP TREMBLED AT THE NOISE
CAN'T HELP IT SAID BEN WHO WAS A LITTLE WILD OVER POLLY AND BESIDES HE HAD BEEN SICK HIMSELF AND HAD BORNE A GOOD DEAL TOO
SHE HAD BEEN UP NEARLY ALL NIGHT BACK AND FORTH FROM BEN'S BED IN THE LOFT TO RESTLESS FRETFUL LITTLE PHRONSIE IN THE BIG FOUR-POSTER IN THE BEDROOM
WE'LL COME OUT EVERY DAY HE ADDED SLIPPING INTO HIS JACKET AND TURNING ENTHUSIASTICALLY BACK TO VAN

WHATEVER'D WE DO MAMMY DON'T KNOW I'M SURE REPLIED MRS PEPPER SETTING HER STITCHES FIRMLY

DON'T ANYBODY KNOW HE BURST OUT PUFFING UP THE STAIRS AND SCOLDING FURIOUSLY AT EVERY STEP ENOUGH TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF THIS CHILD THAN TO HAVE SUCH GOINGS ON WHAT IS THE MATTER FATHER ASKED MRS WHITNEY COMING UP THE STAIRS AFTER HIM

WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A GOOD LONG TIME BEFORE BREAKFAST
AND TO HAVE SMALL MORALS AND MANNERS TAUGHT IN JUST THE RIGHT WAY
DO HURRY
NOBODY'LL SEE ME IF I TUCK MY FOOT UNDER THE PIANO
THEY SAID--'OH GRANDPAPA DO LET US GO WITH YOU AND JAPPY AND WHAT SAID THE CHILDREN
I CAN FIND IT MYSELF I KNOW I CAN SO SHE SLIPPED OUT OF BED AND PROWLING AROUND ON THE FLOOR FELT ALL ABOUT FOR THE LITTLE CUSHION
AND IN THAT SMILE THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE SEEMED TO HOP RIGHT OUT AND BRING BACK IN A FLASH ALL THE NICE TIMES THOSE EIGHT HAPPY WEEKS HAD BROUGHT HIM
HEY SAID GRANDMA IN A PERFECT BEWILDERMENT
PEPPERS AGAIN REPEATED MR WHITNEY IN A PUZZLED WAY

BUT JOEL DECLARING HE COULD WRITE HAD ALREADY BEGUN SO THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR IT
THOROUGHLY FRIGHTENED SHE PLUNGED OVER THE CROSSING TO REACH IT
THEN HE LAUNCHED OUT INTO A DESCRIPTION OF HOW THEY OPENED THE PACKAGE--PRINCE LOOKING ON AND BEGGING FOR ONE OF THE CAKES
AND THE LITTLE PEPPERS ALL EXCEPT BEN THE OLDEST OF THE FLOCK WERE ENJOYING A BREATHING SPELL AS THEIR MOTHER CALLED IT WHICH MEANT SOME QUIET WORK SUITABLE FOR THE HOUR
AND THEN WITH ONE WILD LOOK THE LITTLE BATTALION BROKE RANKS AND TUMBLING ONE OVER THE OTHER IN DECIDEDLY UNMILITARY STYLE PRESENTED A VERY QUEER APPEARANCE
OH ARE YOU GOING OUT HE SAID GLANCING IMPATIENTLY AT HER ATTIRE
BUT I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN MAKE CAN'T WE SAID POLLY--AND SHE KNELT DOWN BY HER MOTHER'S SIDE AND PUT HER FACE IN BETWEEN THE SEWING IN MRS PEPPER'S LAP AND THE EYES BENT KINDLY DOWN ON HER--"MAKE SOME LITTLE CAKES REAL CAKES I MEAN

THE NEIGHBORS CAME IN SOFTLY AND WITH AWESTRUCK VISAGES STOLE INTO THE BEDROOM TO LOOK AT THE CHILD

DO GO OUT MOTHER AND SEE WHAT TIS SAID POLLY
JASPER LOOKING OUT WAS CONSIDERABLY ASTONISHED TO SEE DRAWN UP IN SOLEMN ARRAY WITH THEIR BACKS TO THE ROAD FIVE CHILDREN WHO STOOD AS IF COMPLETELY PETRIFIED
IF YOU DON'T MIND I'LL COME AGAIN--I MEAN I'LL COME SOME OTHER DAY IF IT'S JUST AS CONVENIENT FOR YOU FOR I DO SO WANT THE BAKING AND THE NICE TIME
ALL THE PENT-UP FEELINGS THAT HAD BEEN SO LONG CONTROLLED HAD FREE VENT NOW
THE TRUTH IS THAT PHRONSIE HAD BEEN PINING FOR POLLY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY BUT FOR HER TO HAVE POLLY
THE TESTY OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE SEAT OPPOSITE HAD RELENTED AND ORDERED THE COACH ABOUT AND BROUGHT HIM HOME IN AN OUTBURST OF GRIEF WHEN ALL HOPE WAS GONE
HE'D HAVE SOMETHING LIKE AND THEN HE CRIED
BUT SOME TIME MAMMY I'M GOING TO BAKE HIM A BIG CAKE SO THERE A THREATENED BLOW ONE DAY A FEW WEEKS AFTER MRS PEPPER AND POLLY WERE BUSY IN THE KITCHEN
A PERFECT SHOUT GREETED THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
HE'S TAKEN WITH A CHILL SAID MRS PEPPER BITING OFF A THREAD SO MISS HULDY FOLSOM TOLD ME LAST NIGHT AND I'M AFRAID HE'S GOING TO HAVE A FEVER OH DEAR SAID POLLY IN DIRE DISTRESS
HERE'S MINE SAID BEN PUTTING UNDER THE FROM ALL OF US A BIG BOLD BEN AND HERE'S MINE ECHOED POLLY SETTING A SLIGHTLY CROOKED POLLY BY ITS SIDE
WE NEVER'LL GET THROUGH THIS DAY SAID POLLY IN DESPAIR AS THE LAST ONE ARRIVED
AND HE FEELS SO SMART TOO HE SAID VINDICTIVELY
DON'T CRY--DON'T MAMMY DEAR AND POLLY STROKED THE CAREWORN FACE LOVINGLY AND PATTED THE SMOOTH HAIR THAT WAS STILL SO BLACK
I'M JASPER KING SAID THE BOY STEPPING UPON THE FLAT STONE BY POLLY'S SIDE
YOU'RE SURE YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT CHECK ASKED MR KING NERVOUSLY GETTING INTO A HANDSOME COACH LINED WITH DARK GREEN SATIN AND SETTLING DOWN AMONG ITS AMPLE CUSHIONS WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
YOU KNOW JAPPY SAID FOLKS HANG ALL SORTS OF PRESENTS ON THE BRANCHES
THEN REACHING UP SHE BEGAN TO PAT AND SMOOTH IT GENTLY WITH ONE LITTLE HAND VERY BAD DEAR GRANDPA IT WON'T SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN IF YOU ONLY KEEP ON TAKING CARE OF IT LITTLE PHRONSIE THEN SAID THE CHILD PERFECTLY DELIGHTED I'M GOING TO TAKE ALL CARE OF YOU GRANDPA ALWAYS SO YOU SHALL SO YOU SHALL CRIED MR KING NO LESS DELIGHTED THAN SHE WAS
HERE SHE IS CRIED JASPER MEETING HER AT THE DOOR
RUN ALONG NOW BUT IT WAS USELESS TO TELL JOEL THAT FOR HE WAS HALF-WAY HOME ALREADY
I MUST SCREAM
MAMMY'LL FIND IT OUT
WHAT UPON EARTH POLLY HOW COULD I CRIED POLLY IN ACCENTS OF DESPAIR NOT HEEDING HER MOTHER'S QUESTION
WE SHALL HAVE TO TIE IT ON IT LOOKS LIKE A PUDDING BAG SAID JOEL AS POLLY TIED IT SECURELY THROUGH THE MIDDLE WITH A BIT OF TWINE
WHILE JASPER WITH A PROUD TOSS OF HIS DARK WAVY HAIR MARCHED UP DELIGHTEDLY AND TOOK THE CHAIR ON HER OTHER SIDE
AND THEN HE ADDED A CUNNING ARRANGEMENT FOR BIRDS TO SWING IN AND TWO OR THREE OTHER THINGS THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH BIRDS AT ALL
WHERE'S POLLY SAID PERCY AT LAST COMING WITH GREAT DISSATISFACTION IN HIS VOICE TO THE LIBRARY DOOR
I GUESS THEY WOULD PHRONSIE PET AND POLLY CAUGHT UP THE LITTLE GIRL AND SPUN ROUND AND ROUND THE OLD KITCHEN TILL THEY WERE BOTH GLAD TO STOP
HE HAD THE LAST YESTERDAY AND YOU FORGOT HIM TO-DAY ASKED MRS PEPPER WITH A LOOK IN HER BLACK EYES POLLY DIDN'T LIKE
AND IF THEY WERE LET INTO THE SECRET THEY'D KEEP IT BETTER SO THEY HAD INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY BEEN INTRUSTED WITH THE PRECIOUS SECRET AND CHARGED WITH THE EXTREME IMPORTANCE OF NEVER LETTING ANY ONE KNOW AND THEY HAD BEEN NEARLY BURSTING EVER SINCE WITH THE WILD DESIRE TO IMPART THEIR KNOWLEDGE
CAN I EVER WEAR MY NEW SHOES AGAIN ASKED THE CHILD GRAVELY LOOKING DISMALLY AT THE BLACK BUNDLE BEFORE HER
AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN RAPTURE ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING
BUT DON'T YOU EAT THE NEW BREAD
I KNOW THAT THEY'VE GONE DOWN TO THE MUSEUM THE WHAT EXCLAIMED JOEL NEARLY AT THE TOP PEERING OVER THE RAILING
LET'S ALL WRITE SAID POLLY
DON'T CRY PHRONSIE
OR ELSE MRS PEPPER WILL BE SENDING FOR HER CHILDREN--AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW MARIAN WE COULDN'T ALLOW THAT--WELL THAT'S ALL
OH JOE YOU DIDN'T STOP TO PLAY ASKED POLLY FROM HER PERCH WHERE SHE SAT SEWING GIVING HIM A REPROACHFUL GLANCE

POLLY THOUGHT BACK
UP AND DOWN SHE HAD BEEN GOING FOR A LONG TIME PERFECTLY FASCINATED
AND PUT EM IN THICK
I SHALL GIVE BEN ONE OF MY KITTIES--THE LITTLEST AND THE BEST HE SAID WITH HEROIC SELF-SACRIFICE
DARLING AND SHE TOOK THE LITTLE GIRL FROM HER FATHER'S ARMS WHO AT LAST LET HER GO DON'T THINK OF YOUR MAMMA'S LETTER
BUT FINDING IT SO VERY ENJOYABLE HE STAYED HIMSELF AND FROLICKED WITH DICK TILL THE OTHERS HEARING THE FUN ALL TOOK HOLD OF HANDS AND FLEW OFF TO JOIN THEM
YES I SHOULD PREFER POLLY MYSELF I THINK AS WE'VE ENOUGH BOYS NOW SMILING TO THINK OF HER OWN BROOD OF WIDE AWAKE YOUNGSTERS
THEN WE'LL GET SOMETHING TO EAT SO THE CINNAMON WAS HANDED UP AND THEN JOEL FLEW BACK TO DAVIE

AND I TALKED--WELL I HAD TO TALK SOME
PHRONSIE HAD ASPIRED TO AN ELABORATE PIN-CUSHION THAT WAS NEARLY DONE MADE OF BITS OF WORSTED AND CANVAS OVER WHOSE SURFACE SHE HAD WANDERED ACCORDING TO HER OWN SWEET WILL IN A WAY CHARMING TO BEHOLD
WE CAN'T PUT IT UP WITHOUT SOME NOISE THE MAN REPLIED BUT WE'LL BE AS STILL AS WE CAN ISN'T IT A BIG ONE MA ASKED JOEL IN THE LOUDEST OF STAGE WHISPERS THAT POLLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR COULDN'T HAVE FAILED TO HEAR IF PHRONSIE HADN'T LAUGHED JUST THEN
P'RAPS HE'S BEEN EATING TOO MUCH EATING SAID POLLY OH MAMSIE HE HASN'T HAD ANYTHING AND SHE POINTED WITH SHAME AND REMORSE TO THE SEED-CUP WITH ONLY A FEW DRIED HUSKS IN THE VERY BOTTOM

WHO FINDING THAT NO ONE TEASED HIM TO DIVULGE HIS WONDERFUL PLAN KEPT TRYING TO HARROW UP THEIR FEELINGS BY PARADING IT
AND NOW HERE SHE WAS
SO WHILE POLLY WORKED AWAY AT HER BREAD WHICH SHE WAS GOING TO MAKE LIKE BISCUITS SHE SAID THE AUDIENCE GATHERED IN THE LITTLE OLD KITCHEN WAS IN THE MERRIEST MOOD AND ENJOYED EVERYTHING TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
OH DEAR EJACULATED MRS PEPPER SINKING IN A CHAIR IN DISMAY AT SIGHT OF BEN'S RED FACE

JUST ONE NO SAID POLLY FIRMLY
I'LL PUT HER IN BED POLLY SAID MRS PEPPER IN A WHISPER AS PHRONSIE CLOSED HER EYES AND BREATHED REGULARLY
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT JOE ASKED POLLY A FEW MINUTES LATER AS HER EYES FELL UPON JOEL WHO SAT WITH HIS BACK TO THE CUPBOARD PERSISTENTLY GAZING AT THE OPPOSITE WALL
THERE NOW HERE THEY ARE
SHE CAME RIGHT IN--AND SHE TALKED AWFULLY
DEACON BROWN'S HORSE BEGAN TO LAG
AND IN THE VERY FIRST FLASH SHE THOUGHT OF HER CUSHION
THEY NEVER WILL COME WON'T THEY POLLY ASKED PHRONSIE ANXIOUSLY AND STANDING QUITE STILL
I'VE COME SAID A CRACKED VOICE CLOSE UP BY THE BEDROOM DOOR FOLLOWED BY A BIG BLACK CAP WHICH COULD BELONG TO NO OTHER THAN GRANDMA BASCOM TO SET BY YOU A SPELL

WHY SHE SAID IN GENTLE SURPRISE THEY'RE ALL DOWN-STAIRS
WHY POLLY OH I DON'T KNOW SAID POLLY CAUSE TIS SO
THERE NOW CRIED THE DOCTOR YOU'RE THE GIRL FOR ME
AND LOOKING UP SHE SAW JOEL WITH A VERY DISTORTED FACE MAKING VIOLENT EFFORTS TO KEEP FROM BURSTING OUT INTO A LOUD CRY
AND EVERYTHING'S JUST SPLENDID
HUSH
YOU HAVEN'T EVER ASKED WHERE THE STOVE CAME FROM POLLY AND TO BE SURE POLLY HAD BEEN SO OVERWHELMED THAT IF THE STOVE HAD REALLY DROPPED FROM THE CLOUDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SMALL MATTER OF ASTONISHMENT TO HER AS LONG AS IT HAD COME
AND I'LL GO WITH YOU OH NO CRIED PHRONSIE SHAKING HER YELLOW HEAD
AND IT WAS THE FEAR OF LOSING THE WORK THAT HAD MADE THE MOTHER'S HEART SINK
YES I HAVE TOO REPLIED JOEL STURDILY MARCHING UP TO HER
AND HE TOOK THE HARD BROWN HAND IN HIS OWN--"YOUR LITTLE GIRL WILL NOT BE BLIND
IT'S JASPER CRIED ALL THE CHILDREN IN A BREATH
HE CAN'T HEAR THERE IF WE WHISPER REAL SOFT YES HE WILL SAID BEN WHO KNEW JOEL'S HEARING FACULTIES MUCH BETTER
BUT BEING GILT-EDGED IT LOOKED VERY MAGNIFICENT TO THE FIVE PAIRS OF EYES DIRECTED TO IT
AND WHERE DO YOU LIVE I LIVE IN PRIMROSE LANE REPLIED POLLY WISHING VERY MUCH THAT SHE WAS BACK THERE
PHRONSIE HAD RETREATED WITH BABY IN HER ARMS BEHIND THE DOOR ON THE NEW ARRIVAL
HOW DID HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY
AND FLINGING HIS ARMS AROUND HIS NECK HE GAVE HIM SUCH A HUG AS HE HADN'T RECEIVED FOR MANY A DAY
WELL

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING JOEL PEPPER
OH I DO WISH CRIED POLLY IN INTENSE ADMIRATION I COULD WRITE SO NICE AND SO FAST AS YOU CAN BEN READ IT POLLY SAID MRS PEPPER IN PRIDE
THERE AS SHE FLUNG IN THE WOOD AND POKED IT ALL UP IN A NICE LITTLE HEAP COAXINGLY
BUT THE STAIRCASE WAS LONG AND LITTLE DICK WAS IN A HURRY AND BESIDES PRINCE WAS IN THE WAY
WHY WE'RE ONLY SPENDING THE SUMMER THERE FATHER AND I IN THE HOTEL WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER ASKED JOEL SQUEEZING IN BETWEEN JASPER AND HIS AUDIENCE
NOW BOYS SAID POLLY GETTING UP AND DRAWING A LONG BREATH I'M GOING OVER TO GRANDMA BASCOM'S TO GET HER TO TELL ME HOW TO MAKE THE CAKE
BUT SHE HAD MET LIFE TOO BRAVELY TO BE BEATEN DOWN NOW
JUST THEN A LITTLE FAINT RAY OF LIGHT SHOT UP FROM BELOW AND MET HER EYES
SO THERE SO SHE IS SAID BEN
WE'RE A-HITTING MA'AM
YOU'VE BEEN GOOD
FOR THE RAISINS AND ALL--YOU'RE SO GOOD THEY'RE AWFUL HARD SAID JOEL INVESTIGATING INTO THE BUNDLE WITH DAVIE WHICH HOWEVER LUCKILY THE OLD LADY DIDN'T HEAR
HERE TIS RUNNING UP TO IT AND POINTING WITH HER FAT LITTLE FINGER
IT OPENED INTO A CORNER ROOM OVERLOOKING THE PARK AS THE SMALL OPEN SPACE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL WAS CALLED
SHE'S A PARSON'S WIFE I SAY AND THEN THE MINISTER CAME DOWN FROM BEN'S ROOM AND WENT INTO THE BEDROOM
IT WAS SO LONG SHE SAID AND MY SHOES HURT AND SHE THRUST OUT THE DUSTY LITTLE BOOTS THAT SPOKE PATHETICALLY OF THE LONG AND UNACCUSTOMED TRAMP
HE COULDN'T STAND UP STRAIGHT HE WAS SO FAT DID HE BITE ASKED PHRONSIE FULL OF INTEREST
AND I'M THANKFUL
HE'S MY BROTHER JOEL SAID POLLY
SHE'LL BE GOIN TO-MORROW
I'M NOT ONE BIT TIRED POLLY
DR FISHER WAS CALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH POLLY'S EYES
AND THEN POLLY'S SOUL SANK DOWN IN DIRE DISMAY
JUST AS QUICK AND PHRONSIE SHOOK HER YELLOW HEAD AT THE DISMAL REMEMBRANCE
HOW BLACK YOU ARE POLLY OH I WISH CRIED POLLY AS THE THOUGHT STRUCK HER THAT DR FISHER COULD SEE IT
AND THEN HE SET UP A LOUD AND ANGRY CHIRPING FLYING UP AND DOWN AND OPENING HIS MOUTH AS IF HE WANTED TO EXPRESS HIS MIND BUT COULDN'T AND OTHERWISE ACTING IN A VERY STRANGE AND UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER
WHERE BUT WHEN THEY GOT UP TO IT JOEL SAW THAT IT WAS ONLY A BIT OF PINK CALICO FLAPPING ON A CLOTHES-LINE
THEN I TELL YOU HERE THE BOY FORGOT HIS CAUTION ABOUT WAKING PHRONSIE--"WE WENT FOR HIM PRINCE AND I
EVEN CHERRY HAD BETTER DIE THAN TO DO ANYTHING HER MOTHER WOULDN'T LIKE
AND THE FATHER AND I'D HAD TO CONTRIVE SOME WAY TO DO WELL SAID BEN AS THE BOY FINISHED AND FASTENED HIS BRIGHT EYES ON HIM SOMEBODY DID COME ALONG
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG PUT IN PERCY
BUT WHAT YOU BEEN DOING WITH THE PAIL NOTHING SAID JOEL
THERE WAS A BUMPING NOISE THAT CAME FROM THE PROVISION ROOM THAT SOUNDED OMINOUS AND THEN A SMOTHERED SOUND OF WORDS FOLLOWED BY A SCUFFLING OVER THE OLD FLOOR
AND THEN THE MOTHER CAME IN AND THOUGH SHE HAD ILL-CONCEALED HILARITY IN HER VOICE SHE KEPT CHATTERING AND BUSTLING AROUND WITH POLLY'S SUPPER TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR A WORD TO BE GOT IN
WHAT ARE THEY LIKE JASPER JASPER SAT QUITE STILL AND DIDN'T REPLY TO THIS QUESTION FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
PHRONSIE OPENED HER EYES VERY WIDE AT THIS
AND POLLY WAS AT HER WIT'S END TO KNOW WHAT TO DO
AND THEN SHE SPRANG OVER THE BIG STOVE DISH-CLOTH AND ALL AND JUST FLUNG HER ARMS AROUND THE DOG'S NECK
SHE ALWAYS CALLS HER BABY SAID POLLY
BUT HE WAS OVER THE WHEEL IN A TWINKLING AND UP WITH A BOUND TO A SMALL THICKET OF SCRUBBY BUSHES ON A HIGH HILL BY THE ROAD-SIDE
GOODNESS JASPER CRIED HIS FATHER FEELING OF HIS THROAT
THURSDAY CAME AND WENT
AND BEN MADE WINDMILLS AND WHISTLES FOR THE BOYS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BEN I DON'T KNOW REPEATED THE BOY STILL HOLDING OUT THE PRECIOUS LETTER
AND THE FIRST THING SHE KNEW A LOVELY BRASS CAGE WITH A DEAR LITTLE BIRD WITH TWO ASTONISHED BLACK EYES DROPPED DOWN INTO POLLY'S HANDS
OH I DON'T KNOW SAID POLLY
AND THEN I WAS GOING TO PUT STONES AND THINGS IN AMONG THEM TO MAKE THEM LOOK PRETTY AND THEY WILL CRIED JASPER
OH DEAR ME

THAT IS THE QUESTION BUT SIR BEGAN MRS PEPPER AGAIN YOU DON'T THINK I DO THINK
HE'S A-STANDIN ON TIP-TOE SAID JOEL CRITICALLY WHO WAS HOVERING NEAR
BUT IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO MAKE HER EYES QUITE STRONG--TIME AND REST
IN VAIN MR KING STORMED AND FRETTED AND BEGGED OFFERING EVERY ADVANTAGE POSSIBLE--POLLY SHOULD HAVE THE BEST FOUNDATION FOR A MUSICAL EDUCATION THAT THE CITY COULD AFFORD
UP CAME MR KING WITH AN ENORMOUS BUNDLE IN HIS ARMS
IT'S A LITTLE GIRL AND I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT SHE WANTS WHY IT'S POLLY PEPPER EXCLAIMED MRS HENDERSON PLEASANTLY
AND HE HASN'T BUT ONE EYE STILL LAUGHED JOEL WHILE LITTLE DAVIE GIGGLED TOO
THERE NOW YOU'LL STAY I GUESS AS WITH THE UNITED EFFORTS OF THE TWO BOYS CHEERED ON BY PHRONSIE'S ENTHUSIASTIC LITTLE CROW OF DELIGHT THE LEATHER WAS CROWDED INTO PLACE AND THE FIRE BEGAN TO BURN

AND HE'LL SHOW HIM ALL THE THINGS
FOR TIMES WERE ALWAYS HARD WITH THEM NOWADAYS
THAT REMOVED THE LAST STRAW THAT MADE IT PUTTING ONE'S SELF UNDER AN OBLIGATION WHICH TO MRS PEPPER'S INDEPENDENT SOUL HAD SEEMED INSURMOUNTABLE
WELL MRS PEPPER RELENTED SLOWLY
IT'S TOO BAD FATHER
DON'T YOU GO TO BOTHERING YOUR HEAD ABOUT IT NOW POLLY--IT'LL COME WHEN IT'S TIME WILL IT ASKED POLLY DOUBTFULLY TAKING UP HER NEEDLE AGAIN
SO IT SERVED HER RIGHT AFTER ALL WELL BUT FATHER AND THE BOY'S DARK EYES GLOWED SHE WAS SUCH A CUNNING LITTLE THING

AND I HOPE THEY'LL ALL DROP OFF CRIED DICK SAVAGELY SHAKING HIS HEAD TO FACILITATE MATTERS
IT BEATS ALL HOW QUICK HE'S PICKED UP
TO HAVE THE PARSON SICK WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM AN ORDINARY PERSON'S ILLNESS
LET POLLY SIT NEXT TO ME SAID VAN AS IF A SEAT NEXT TO HIM WAS OF ALL THINGS MOST TO BE DESIRED
AND THEN SHE DID THE QUEEREST THING OF THE WHOLE
GETTING THROUGH WITH THE LESSONS IN THE SCHOOLROOM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO RUSH TO HER MUSIC UNTIL PRESENTLY THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN WAXED ENTHUSIASTIC TO THAT DEGREE THAT AS DAY AFTER DAY PROGRESSED AND SWELLED INTO WEEKS AND EACH LESSON CAME TO AN END HE WOULD SKIP AWAY ON THE TIPS OF HIS TOES HIS NOSE IN THE AIR AND THE WAXED ENDS OF HIS MOUSTACHE FAIRLY TREMBLING WITH DELIGHT AH SUCH PATIENCE AS MADEMOISELLE PEP-PAIRE HAS
AS LONG AS PHRONSIE WASN'T DANGEROUS IT SEEMED QUITE LIKE RICH FOLKS
AND HER MOTHER WAS JUST ON THE POINT ALTHOUGH IT ALMOST KILLED HER OF SENDING FOR POLLY--AS IF WE SHOULD HAVE LET HER GO HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON
OH YES CRIED MRS BEEBE GOOD-NATUREDLY BEGINNING TO CLAMBER OVER THE WHEEL
THERE SAID VAN TAKING OFF HIS JACKET AND FLINGING IT ON THE GRASS WHILE JOEL IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED SUIT WITH HIS LITTLE HOMESPUN ONE

LAND ALIVE SAID THE OLD LADY SITTING DOWN IN THE CHAIR WHICH HE BROUGHT HER
THEY MIGHT AS WELL SHE CRIED TOSSING THAT BOOT ON THE FLOOR IN INTENSE SCORN WHILE SHE INVESTIGATED THE STATE OF THE OTHER ONE
THEN MY HEAD WILL FEEL BETTER AND HE SAT DOWN AND DREW HER INTO HIS ARMS
LOOK YOUR LAST POLLY

AS LONG AS SHE'S GIVEN US LEAVE I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS I NEITHER SAID POLLY WITH THE DELICIOUS FEELING AS IF THE WHOLE WORLD WERE BEFORE THEM WHERE TO CHOOSE
AT LAST HE FLUNG DOWN HIS PAPER TWITCHED HIS FINGERS THROUGH HIS HAIR TWO OR THREE TIMES AND THEN BURST OUT--"WELL WHY DON'T YOU SEND FOR HER
THEY CAN'T EVER EAT THIS
AT NIGHT WHEN NO ONE KNEW IT THE TEARS WOULD COME RACING OVER THE POOR FORLORN LITTLE FACE AND WOULD NOT BE SQUEEZED BACK
DEAR MISS POLLY'--THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS WELL SAID MRS PEPPER THEN YOU'D BETTER SAY DEAR MISTER JASPER'--OR YOU MIGHT SAY DEAR MR KING OH DEAR CRIED POLLY THAT WOULD BE THE FATHER THEN--S'POSE HE SHOULD THINK WE WROTE TO HIM AND POLLY LOOKED HORROR-STRICKEN TO THE LAST DEGREE

BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO FIX UP FOR A TALL PORTLY GENTLEMAN LEANING ON HIS HEAVY GOLD CANE WAS WALKING UP FROM THE LITTLE BROWN GATE TO THE BIG FLAT-STONE THAT SERVED AS A STEP

I KNOW DAVE'LL GET SOME OF MY THINGS OH NO JOE SAID MRS PEPPER SANTA CLAUS IS SMART
BUT HE WILL BE I GUESS IF HE FEELS WELL THEN COME ON THURSDAY SAID POLLY

AND NEVER WAS SHE VERY LONG ABSENT FROM HIS SIDE WHICH SO PLEASED THE OLD GENTLEMAN THAT HE COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN HIMSELF AS WITH A GRAVITY BEFITTING THE IMPORTANCE OF HER OFFICE SHE WOULD FOLLOW HIM AROUND IN A HAPPY CONTENTED WAY THAT TOOK WITH HIM IMMENSELY
I'LL FIND THE KEY CHILDREN SHE SAID I THINK I KNOW WHERE TIS AND THEN WE CAN KEEP THEM OUT WELL BUT IT LOOKS SO SAID POLLY DEMURRING AT THE PROSPECT
BY THIS TIME POLLY WAS SO WORN THAT SHE CAME VERY NEAR TURNING AND FLEEING BUT SHE THOUGHT OF HER MOTHER'S DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER AND THE LOSS OF THE NEWS AND STOOD QUITE STILL

HERE SAID MR ATKINS STEPPING UP TO THE POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT QUITE SMART WITH ITS ARRAY OF BOXES AND OFFICIAL NOTICES WHERE BEN HAD ALWAYS LINGERED WISHING THERE MIGHT BE SOMETIME A LETTER FOR HIM--OR SOME OF THEM
HER DELIGHT IN THE CAKE WAS FULLY ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE MOST EXACTING MIND

TILL ONLY THE THREE DAYS REMAINED AND TO THINK THE FUN THAT POLLY AND BEN HAD HAD ALREADY

BUT MRS PEPPER TOOK HER UP FIRMLY IN HER ARMS AS IF SHE WERE PHRONSIE AND SAT DOWN IN THE OLD ROCKING-CHAIR AND JUST PATTED HER BACK
DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY WILL AND HE TURNED RIGHT STRAIGHT AROUND ON THE STAIRS AND LOOKED AT VAN
DO SOMEBODY STOP HIM JOEL SAID JASPER LEANING OVER HIM AND TRYING TO HELP POLLY LIFT HIM UP
THERE IT'S ALL SAFE AND HE PUT IT CAREFULLY INTO PHRONSIE'S APRON WHEN SHE BREATHED EASIER
THEN WHAT'LL YOU DO IT SHA'N'T SAID POLLY RUNNING UP TO LOOK IT IN THE FACE
JUST AS SHE HAD SUCCEEDED THE DOOR OPENED AND GRANDMA BASCOM WALKED IN
SHE GAZED UP TO THE OLD BEAMS OVERHEAD AND AROUND THE DINGY WALLS AND TO THE OLD BLACK STOVE WITH THE FIRE NEARLY OUT AND THEN OVER EVERYTHING THE KITCHEN CONTAINED TRYING TO THINK HOW IT WOULD SEEM
EVEN THE CUNNING BLANDISHMENTS OF A VERY ATTRACTIVE MONKEY THAT ALWAYS HAD ENTERTAINED THE CHILDREN ON THEIR NUMEROUS VISITS FAILED TO INTEREST HER NOW
NOW JOE YOU BETTER LET BEN HOLD YOUR HAND SAID POLLY WARNINGLY
YOU COME ALONG OF ME WHISPERED GRANDMA WHEN AT LAST HER CALL WAS DONE TO JOEL WHO STOOD BY THE DOOR
THAT'S TOO BAD AND HE BEGAN TO FEEL IN ALL HIS POCKETS INDUSTRIOUSLY
MR KING PUSHED INTO THE HOUSE WITH HIS BURDEN
THEY WOULD BOB OVER AT EACH OTHER AND SMILE WITH SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS A NEW IDEA WOULD STRIKE ONE OF THEM IN THE MOST MYSTERIOUS WAY THAT IF OBSERVED WOULD DRIVE THE OTHERS ALMOST WILD
THE SWEETEST LITTLE MONKEY YOU EVER SAW WHAT IS A MONKEY ASKED PHRONSIE SKURRYING AFTER POLLY TO THE GATE WHERE HER MOTHER WAS WAITING FOR THEM
I DON'T BELIEVE IT POLLY PHOOH

IT'S IN THE TOP BUREAU DRAWER YES'M SAID POLLY TAKING HER EYES OFF BY A VIOLENT WRENCH FROM THE FASCINATING WATCH
THERE LAY THE PAPER WET AND TORN DOWN AT THEIR FEET
I SHOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH--DO INVITE BEN I DON'T WANT BEN SAID JASPER GLOOMILY I WANT POLLY HE ADDED THIS IN MUCH THE SAME TONE AS PHRONSIE'S WHEN SHE HAD RUSHED UP TO HIM THE DAY SHE WAS LOST DECLARING I WANT POLLY VERY WELL THEN SAID SISTER MARIAN LAUGHING I'M SURE I DIDN'T MEAN TO DICTATE WHICH ONE
I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE HOUSE AND NOT A TRACE OF ANYBODY COULD I FIND OH FATHER CRIED MRS WHITNEY
GRANDPAPA'S GOING TO MR KING ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AS HIS DAUGHTER ALL UNCONSCIOUS RAN DOWN WITH A LIGHT STEP AND A SMILE ON HER FACE
DAVIE TOO WORKED PATIENTLY OUT OF DOORS TRYING TO DO BEN'S CHORES
SO YOU ARE LAUGHED THE OLD GENTLEMAN SUDDENLY
BUT JASPER'S SICK AND THERE ISN'T ANYTHING FOR HIM TO DO AND HERE SHE WHISPERED SLYLY UP INTO HIS EAR DON'T YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU LIKED FOLKS TO SEND YOU THINGS WHEN YOU HAD THE MEASLES YES I KNOW SAID JOEL BEGINNING TO SMILE THROUGH HIS TEARS
AND I'LL FINISH SWEEPING UP SAID POLLY WHICH GRANDMA DIDN'T HEAR
AT THIS WORD BREAD POLLY WHO WAS HALF WAY DOWN THE HALL CAME RUNNING BACK
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM I'M SURE WELL SAID THE BOY LAUGHING WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DID WE PRINCE STROKING THE BIG HEAD OF THE DOG WHO WAS SLOWLY FOLLOWING THE TWO AS THEY PACED UP AND DOWN BUT KEEPING CAREFULLY ON THE SIDE OF HIS MASTER
LOOK AT HER NOW POLLY QUICK YES SAID POLLY ISN'T SHE SWEET SWEET SAID JASPER
ISN'T ANYBODY GOING TO KISS ME I WONDER THE TWO LITTLE WHITNEYS WHO WERE EAGERLY CLUTCHING POLLY'S ARMS TURNED AROUND
WHAT DID YOU GET UP FOR MRS WHITNEY ASKED
MR KING WAS STORMING UP AND DOWN AND CALLING ON EVERYBODY TO BRING A BOWL OF WATER AND SOME BROWN PAPER
HER FACE PRICKED SHE SAID AND SHE WAS RUBBING IT VIGOROUSLY WITH BOTH FAT LITTLE HANDS AND THEN CRYING WORSE THAN EVER
OVER THE BIG FLAT DOOR-STONE SHE SPED AND MET BEN WITH LITTLE DAVID COMING IN THE GATE
JUST THEN A SMALL AND PECULIAR NOISE STRUCK HER EAR
HE CARRIED OUT GRANDMA'S WISHES AND DISTRIBUTED CONSCIENTIOUSLY THE PRECIOUS DROPS
I FORGOT YOU--HERE BUT AS QUICK AS A FLASH HE WAS PUSHED ASIDE AND A BRIGHT BOYISH FIGURE DASHED UP
MAMSIE WANTED ME
A CAR WAS JUST IN SIGHT--THAT WAS FINE
YOU HAD EM HAD WHAT ASKED POLLY IN ASTONISHMENT
I CAN FIX IT I MOST KNOW
IT MAKES ME FEEL VERY BADLY TO SEE HER SAD LITTLE FACE I DON'T KNOW SAID VAN RUNNING OVER IN HIS MIND ALL THE POSSIBLE WAYS HE COULD THINK OF FOR ENTERTAINING ANYBODY UNLESS SHE'D LIKE MY NEW BOOK OF TRAVELS--OR MY VELOCIPEDE HE ADDED
THERE IT'S OVER NOW SHE CRIED
NOW SAID JAPPY WHEN HE HEARD THE ACCOUNT OF THE ADVENTURE I SAY THAT LETTER OUGHT TO GO TO YOUR MOTHER POLLY OH SAID POLLY IT WOULD SCARE MAMSIE MOST TO DEATH JAPPY DON'T TELL HER THE WHOLE SAID JASPER QUICKLY I DIDN'T MEAN THAT--ABOUT THE HORSES AND ALL THAT--BUT ONLY ENOUGH TO LET HER SEE HOW PHRONSIE TRIED TO GET IT TO HER AND I'M GOING TO WRITE TO YOUR BROTHER JOEL SAID VAN DRAWING UP TO THE LIBRARY TABLE
AND ALTHOUGH THE REST WERE ALMOST DYING TO BE OUT IN THE KITCHEN THEY CONSCIENTIOUSLY STUCK TO THEIR BARGAIN TO KEEP POLLY OCCUPIED
THEN DAVE YOU'LL SEE HOW I'LL WRITE--I TELL YOU AND I'M GOIN TO--MA CAN'T I SAID DAVIE UNWILLING TO BE OUTDONE

TIE EM UP QUICK'S YOU CAN AND I'LL TAKE EM OVER TO DEACON BLODGETT'S FOR HE'S GOIN TO START EARLY IN THE MORNING SO AFTER ANOTHER LAST LOOK ALL AROUND POLLY PUT THE CAKES IN THE PAPER AND TIED IT WITH FOUR OR FIVE STRONG KNOTS TO AVOID ALL DANGER OF ITS UNDOING
YES BARK
BUT WHEN IT WAS PHRONSIE'S TURN SHE PROTESTED THAT POLLY AND NO ONE ELSE MUST HOLD HER HAND
FOR EACH OF THE THREE BOYS INSISTED ON DOING HIS PART SO THAT WHEN THEY WERE FINALLY DONE UP IN AN ENORMOUS ENVELOPE AND PUT INTO MR KING'S HANDS HE TOLD THEM WITH A LAUGH THAT THERE WAS NO USE FOR JAPPY AND HIMSELF TO GO AS THOSE WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO WIN ALMOST ANYBODY'S CONSENT
I HOPE NOT YET BUT IT'S THESE DREADFUL HATEFUL OLD BUTTONS AND SHE TWITCHED THE BOOT OFF FROM HER FOOT WITH SUCH AN IMPATIENT LITTLE PULL THAT THREE OR FOUR MORE WENT FLYING UNDER THE BED
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE HICKORY NUTS TO EAT
NO CONSEQUENCE AT ALL HE REPEATED WAVING HIS HAND EMPHATICALLY BECAUSE I'VE MADE UP MY MIND AND ARRANGED ALL MY PLANS--IT'S ONLY ABOUT THE PEPPERS THE PEPPERS REPEATED MRS WHITNEY
YOU GOT POUNDED DID YOU LOOKING AT PHRONSIE AS SHE TOOK THE LITTLE FOOT IN HER AMPLE HAND
I MUST GET RIGHT DOWN WHAT'S THE MATTER PHRONSIE ASKED MRS PEPPER TRYING TO HOLD HER BACK

POLLY STRIPPED OFF RECKLESSLY HER CHOICEST BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FROM THE GAY LITTLE STAND OF FLOWERS IN THE CORNER THAT HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO BLOSSOM AND TUCKED THEM INTO EVERY LITTLE NOOK IN THE BOX THAT COULD POSSIBLY HOLD A POSY
POLLY HAD TRIED HER BEST TO HELP HER AND HAD RUBBED HER EYES DILIGENTLY TO KEEP AWAKE BUT SHE WAS WHOLLY UNACCUSTOMED TO IT AND HER HEALTHY TIRED LITTLE BODY SUCCUMBED--AND THEN WHEN SHE AWOKE SHAME AND REMORSE FILLED HER VERY HEART
WELL MR ATKINS SAYS TIS SAID BEN IMPATIENTLY
EVERYTHING'S JUST AS BAD AS IT CAN BE
A STOVE A WHAT SAID THE DOCTOR LOOKING AT HER AND THEN AT THE OLD BLACK THING IN THE CORNER THAT LOOKED AS IF IT WERE ASHAMED OF ITSELF
SHOULDN'T YOU SAY HE MIGHT GET UP IN A DAY OR TWO MRS BEEBE SHE APPEALED TO THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS KNITTING AWAY CHEERILY IN THE CORNER
IT'S IN THE PROVISION ROOM THE PROVISION ROOM WAS A LITTLE SHED THAT WAS TACKED ON TO THE MAIN HOUSE AND REACHED BY A SHORT FLIGHT OF RICKETY STEPS

AND A MOMENT OR TWO AFTER AT A SUMMONS FROM A CALLER MRS WHITNEY LEFT THE ROOM
CAUSE THERE'S A CA UGH AND POLLY CLAPPED HER HAND ON THE CHILD'S MOUTH
HE STOOD VERY QUIETLY HOWEVER UNTIL HIS FATHER FINISHED
DO GET HER OFF FROM IT MAMMY PHRONSIE SAID MRS PEPPER GOING UP BACK OF THE CHILD WHO SAT PATIENTLY IN HER HIGH CHAIR WAITING FOR POLLY TO LET HER BEGIN HADN'T YOU RATHER WAIT AND GIVE YOUR GINGERBREAD BOY TO JASPER FOR HIS FATHER WHEN HE COMES OH NO NO CRIED PHRONSIE TWISTING IN HER CHAIR IN GREAT APPREHENSION I WANT TO SEND IT NOW I DO WELL POLLY SAID HER MOTHER LAUGHING AFTER ALL IT'S BEST I THINK TO LET HER
TWASN'T HER FAULT PHRONSIE SAID MRS WHITNEY SMILINGLY STOOPING OVER THE CHILD WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE PUSSY I HAVE FOR YOU BUT THE CHUBBY FACE DIDN'T LOOK UP BRIGHTLY AS USUAL
BEFORE VERY MANY MINUTES WERE OVER VAN RELINQUISHED ALL IDEAS OF TREATING HIS COMPANY WITH EXTRA CONSIDERATION AND WAS ONLY THINKING HOW HE COULD POSSIBLY HOLD HIS OWN WITH THE VALIANT LITTLE COUNTRY LAD
HE WAS A LITTLE THIN MAN AND THE WATCH WAS IMMENSE
AND SHE SAID WHAT DID SHE SAY ASKED MRS PEPPER THINKING PERHAPS IT TO BE THE WISER THING TO LET POLLY FREE HER MIND
AND A FUNNY LITTLE CARVED BASKET WITH A HANDLE FOR PHRONSIE OUT OF A HICKORY NUT SHELL
JAPPY'S ALWAYS SAID SO

YOU'LL RUN HIS LEGS OFF JOEL AT LAST SHE SAID WHEN HE SENT DAVID THE THIRD TIME DOWN TO THE WOOD-PILE FOR A STICK OF JUST THE EXACT THICKNESS AND WHICH THE LITTLE MESSENGER DECLARED WASN'T TO BE FOUND
JOEL FRIGHTENED TO DEATH AT LAST SAID I'M GOING TO WAKE UP BEN THAT BROUGHT POLLY TO
IF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I CAN POSTPONE GOING FOR ANOTHER DAY AND REALLY IMPORTANT REPEATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IRASCIBLY
THEN LOOKING WITH A LONG KEEN GAZE INTO THE BOY'S EYES THAT MET HER OWN SO FRANKLY AND KINDLY
NO NICE FAMILY EVER HAD THE NAME OF PEPPER WELL I DON'T CARE AND JASPER'S LAUGH WAS LOUD AND MERRY
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING TWASN'T ANYTHING BUT THE PAIL ANSWERED JOEL NOT LOOKING AT HER
I MUST TAKE THE POSIES OFF AND KEEP THEM FRESH IN WATER SO THE CAKE WAS FINALLY DEPOSITED IN A PLACE OF SAFETY FOLLOWED BY THE EYES OF ALL THE CHILDREN
NOW WE CAN BEGIN PERFECTLY SPLENDID
AND DAVIE OH!--OH!--OO-H AND THEN THE SOUNDS THAT ANSWERED HER AS WITH SMOTHERED WHOOPS OF EXPECTATION THEY ONE AND ALL FLEW INTO THEIR CLOTHES
AND YOU'RE A REAL GOOD BOY DAVIE TO GIVE IT
ANYWAY WE MUST HAVE A CAKE
BUT WHERE ARE THE BOYS THEY WENT AFTER YOU SAID DAVIE AFTER WE CAME HOME WITH OUR SHOES NO THEY DIDN'T CONTRADICTED JOEL FLATLY
I KNOW THEY HAVE
AND NOW-A-DAYS NO ONE EVER SAW THE OLD GENTLEMAN GOING OUT OF A MORNING WHEN JASPER WAS BUSY WITH HIS LESSONS WITHOUT PHRONSIE BY HIS SIDE AND MANY PEOPLE TURNED TO SEE THE PORTLY FIGURE WITH THE HANDSOME HEAD BENT TO CATCH THE PRATTLE OF A LITTLE SUNNY-HAIRED CHILD WHO TROTTED ALONG CLASPING HIS HAND CONFIDINGLY
AND THE MONKEY TOO HE SHALL HAVE SOMETHING FOR HIS PAINS IN AMUSING MY CHILDREN THE MAN LOOKED VERY CROSS WHEN SHE BROUGHT HIM OUT ONLY BROWN BREAD AND TWO COLD POTATOES
OH BEN DID YOU LOCK THE DOOR YES HE SAID
FOUR YESTERDAYS AGO AND THEN POLLY STOPPED IN SWEEPING UP AND RELATED WITH MANY ADDITIONS AND EXPLANATIONS FROM THE OTHERS THE HISTORY OF THE STOVE AND GOOD DR FISHER UPON WHOM THEY ALL DILATED AT GREAT LENGTH AND THE DREADFUL MEASLES AND EVERYTHING
DON'T WAKE HER SAID MRS PEPPER
IF BEN WERE ONLY WELL TO TALK TO ME OH I SAY POLLY SCREAMED JOEL AT THAT MOMENT RUNNING IN BEN'S A-COMIN DOWN THE STAIRS STOP JOE SAID MRS PEPPER
WHY SHE'S NEVER HAD ONE WELL SHE'S GOT ONE NOW SURE ENOUGH SAID MR ATKINS
THE LITTLE FELLOW BLUNDERED OVER THINGS THAT BEN WOULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IN HALF THE TIME AND HE HAD TO SIT DOWN OFTEN ON THE STEPS OF THE LITTLE OLD SHED WHERE THE TOOLS WERE KEPT TO WIPE HIS HOT FACE AND REST
VERY BAD INDEED HE REPEATED IMPRESSIVELY
ONE THING PHRONSIE ALWAYS INSISTED ON AND KEPT TO IT PERTINACIOUSLY--AND THAT WAS TO GO INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM WITH POLLY WHEN SHE WENT TO PRACTICE AND THERE WITH ONE OF HER NUMEROUS FAMILY OF DOLLS TO SIT DOWN QUIETLY IN SOME CORNER AND WAIT TILL SHE GOT THROUGH
PHRONSIE TURNED AND THREW HERSELF INTO POLLY'S PROTECTING ARMS WHO GATHERED HER UP AND SITTING DOWN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE CHAIR COMFORTED HER AS ONLY SHE COULD
THE BITTER STUFF CRIED POLLY WITH A WRY FACE
THERE NOW YOU AND I PHRONSIE WILL STAY BY OURSELVES
WHY IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE HAVE BEEN HERE AN HOUR
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN MY FATHER BEN PEPPER OH THEN HE WAS ANGRY CRIED BEN
OH DEAR DON'T CRIED POLLY IN DISMAY TRYING HER BEST TO STOP HER OH PHRONSIE DO STOP SHE IMPLORED POINTING INTO THE NEXT ROOM WHENCE THE SOUND OF HAPPY VOICES ISSUED THEY'LL ALL HEAR YOU BUT PHRONSIE IN HER GRIEF DIDN'T CARE BUT WAILED ON STEADILY
DO SIT DOWN PET

AND BESIDES MADAM HE SAID ADDRESSING MRS PEPPER I THINK THE CLIMATE IS BAD FOR ME NOW AS IT INDUCES RHEUMATISM
I'LL GO--IF YOU THINK I OUGHT TO
OH BUT I MUST SAID PHRONSIE ENERGETICALLY WRIGGLING
THE DAY SEEMED TO BE ALWAYS JUST RACING AHEAD OF HER AND TURNING A CORNER BEFORE SHE COULD CATCH UP TO IT AND BEN AND THE OTHER BOYS ONLY CAUGHT DISSOLVING VIEWS OF HER AS SHE FLITTED THROUGH HALLS OR OVER STAIRS
THE DOCTOR WOULDN'T LET YOU

TISN'T VERY COLD SAID PHRONSIE TUCKING UP HER TOES UNDER THE NIGHT-GOWN BUT POLLY HURRIED HER INTO BED WHERE SHE CURLED HERSELF UP UNDER THE CLOTHES WATCHING HER MAKE A BIG KNOT
BEFORE THEY GOT THROUGH THEY HAD QUITE A BUNDLE OF INVITATIONS AND PLEADINGS
A RED ONE PHRONSIE

POLLY SHALL DECIDE IT SAID SISTER MARIAN LAUGHING
YOU HAVEN'T ANY SOFT SOAP TO-DAY HAVE YOU
AND THEN POLLY GAVE HER MESSAGES WHICH NOW SHE MANAGED EASILY ENOUGH
OH WHOCKY CRIED JOEL
HOWEVER SHE THOUGHT BY HER STORY-TELLING SHE GOT OFF EASILY AS EACH EVENING SAW THE BOYS DRAG THEIR UNWILLING FEET TO-BEDWARD AND LEAVE BEN AND HERSELF IN PEACE TO PLAN AND WORK UNDISTURBED
ALL I COULD FIND OUT WAS THAT SHE HAD MARRIED AN ENGLISHMAN BY THE NAME OF PEPPER OH CRIED ALL THE CHILDREN TOGETHER
HERE HE IS
HERE HE IS
I WON'T BE GONE LONG AND SHE WAS OFF
I HAD SORE EYES ONCE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL--HOW OLD ARE YOU SHE ASKED ABRUPTLY

POLLY DOES EVERYTHING SIR HUMPH SAID THE DOCTOR
YOU DON'T SAY SO CHICK YES SAID PHRONSIE SHAKING HER YELLOW HEAD VERY WISELY AT HIM AND DIVING DOWN INTO HER CUP OF VERY WEAK MILK AND WATER TO SEE IF POLLY HAD PUT ANY SUGAR IN BY MISTAKE--A PROCEEDING ALWAYS EXPECTANTLY OBSERVED
WHEN MORNING DID COME POLLY COULD HARDLY MOVE
AS HE WAS GOING OUT RATHER DISMALLY THE STOREKEEPER WHO WAS ALSO POSTMASTER CALLED OUT OH HALLOA THERE WHAT IS IT ASKED BEN TURNING BACK THINKING PERHAPS MR ATKINS HADN'T GIVEN HIM THE RIGHT CHANGE
YOU MUST GET EVER SO MANY HICKORY NUTS

ALL THE NICE TIMES YOU USED TO HAVE IN IT

HE WANTED TO SURPRISE POLLY OH IS HE CRIED POLLY CLASPING HER HANDS IN RAPTURE
IT WAS ALWAYS EITHER POLLY'S MOTHER OR PHRONSIE'S MOTHER JUST LIKE A WOMAN HE ADDED WITH A MISCHIEVOUS GLANCE AT HIS WIFE NOT TO BE EXPLICIT AND JUST LIKE A MAN SHE RETORTED WITH A HAPPY LITTLE LAUGH NOT TO ASK FOR EXPLANATIONS I HEAR JAPPY CRIED POLLY IN A GLAD VOICE AND BEN--OH GOOD AS A SOUND OF RUSHING FOOTSTEPS WAS HEARD OVER THE VERANDA STEPS AND DOWN THE LONG HALL

THE CARD ON IT SAID
WHO IS IT ANYWAY CRIED JOEL TIRED OF ADMIRING HIS PRECIOUS SHOES AND GETTING UP TO HEAR THEM SQUEAK THAT GREAT BIG MAN YOU KNOW POLLY THAT CAME IN WITH YOU WHY I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU SAID POLLY AT HER WIT'S END OVER PHRONSIE
ONLY STOPPING LONG ENOUGH TO FLING SOME SCRAPS OF REASSURING NONSENSE TO THE TWO BOYS WHO WERE THOROUGHLY DISMAYED AT BEING OBLIGED TO REMOVE THEIR TRAPS INTO A CORNER
SO BEN DREW UPON HIS POWERS AS STORY-TELLER TO SUIT HIS EXACTING AUDIENCE AND WAS MAKING HIS BEAR WORK HAVOC UPON POOR TOMMY IN A WAY CAPTIVATING TO ALL EVEN JOEL WHEN WELL I DECLARE SOUNDED MRS PEPPER'S CHEERY VOICE COMING IN UPON THEM IF THIS ISN'T COMFORTABLE OH MAMMY CRIED PHRONSIE JUMPING OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS WHITHER SHE HAD TAKEN REFUGE DURING THE THRILLING TALE AND RUNNING TO HER MOTHER WHO GATHERED HER BABY UP WE'VE HAD A BEAR

AND HE THREW DOWN HIS BOOK AND JUMPED FOR HIS CAP
AND HE DREW FORWARD A BIG EASY-CHAIR THAT THE BOY WAS TUGGING AT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
AND SO I MUST SAY IT ALL IN AS FEW WORDS AS POSSIBLE HE CONTINUED
THAT'S RIGHT
THEY HAVE EVERYTHING WELL THEY SHAN'T BITE BEN CRIED JOEL IN TERROR

ONLY POLLY PEEPED INTO ONE OF HER BOOKS AND SAW IN JAPPY'S PLAIN HAND--"I HOPE WE'LL BOTH READ THIS NEXT SUMMER AND TURNING OVER TO THE TITLE-PAGE SHE SAW A COMPLETE MANUAL OF COOKERY THE BEST IS TO COME SAID MRS HENDERSON IN HER GENTLE WAY
PERHAPS SHE WON'T WAKE UP THE BIG DOG MOVED AWAY A STEP OR TWO BUT STILL KEPT HIS EYE ON PHRONSIE
AN OLD BLACK PUDDING BAG HE FINISHED
AND IT WAS FUN TO ANSWER THEM
HOW WE LOOK NEVER MIND MAMMY CALLED BACK POLLY LONGING TO SPRING OUT OF BED AND FIX UP A BIT
HOW BEN PEPPER WELL SAID BEN PLEASANTLY WE'D SET IT UP IN THE CORNER OH NO NOT IN THE CORNER CRIED POLLY WHOSE SPIRITS BEGAN TO RISE A LITTLE AS SHE SAW BEN SO HOPEFUL
THAT IS IF MAMSIE CAN SHE ADDED REMEMBERING HOW VERY BUSY HER MOTHER WOULD BE
THAT'S IT HE ADDED SEEING THEM BOTH FIXED TO HIS SATISFACTION
YES TRULY--EVERY DAY THEN I'LL GROW RIGHT AWAY I WILL SAID PHRONSIE BURSTING OUT MERRILY
POLLY SAT IN THE DRAWING-ROOM NEAR THE EDGE OF THE TWILIGHT PRACTICING AWAY BRAVELY
OH BY JAPPY PLEASE SAID POLLY QUICKLY AS IF THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
IF TWAS ANYTHIN BUT MY EYES MAMMY I COULD STAND IT SHE BEWAILED FLOUNCING OVER AND OVER IN HER IMPATIENCE
AND THERE ARE SHELLS AND BUGS AND STONES--AND AN AWFUL OLD CROCODILE AND OH DEAR SIGHED JOEL PERFECTLY OVERCOME AT SUCH A VISION AND SITTING DOWN ON THE STAIRS TO THINK
IT SNAPPED
AND I CAN SEW EM ON AFTERWARDS--THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF TIME
SISTER MARIAN WANTS TO GO SO THAT'S ALL RIGHT
NOW WHEN YOU GET IN YOU CAN HOLD HER HEAD
IT'S UP TO MR KING'S
AND FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE BROWN PAPER AND WATER WHICH HE HAD ORDERED AND WHICH WAS NOW WAITING FOR HIM AT HIS ELBOW JUST BY THAT CREATURE HE'S THE NOBLEST BEGAN JASPER THROWING HIS ARMS AROUND HIS NECK
JAPPY CAME THROUGH THE HALL AND FOUND THEM THUS
HER HAND WAS GATHERED UP INTO THE KIND ONE THAT HELD PHRONSIE'S
AND THEN THEY ALL FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT A VERY WRONG QUESTION HAD BEEN ASKED
OR PHRONSIE WON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO ANOTHER RECEET WAS LOOKED OVER AND SELECTED
A RAP AT THE DOOR AND LITTLE DAVID RAN DOWN TO FIND THE CAUSE
LOOK OUT CRIED A RINGING VOICE
AND SO POLLY AND PHRONSIE SOON KNEW THAT MAMSIE AND THE BOYS WERE TO BE INVITED
THAT BROUGHT POLLY TO
DO STOP LAUGHING
SO YOU AND POLLY MUST KEEP HOUSE YES'M SAID JOEL
LET'S ASK HER NOW--THIS VERY SAME MINUTE AND THEY SCAMPERED HURRIEDLY TO MRS PEPPER WHO TO THEIR EXTREME ASTONISHMENT AFTER ALL SAID YES AND SMILED ENCOURAGINGLY ON THE PLAN
FEELS JUST LIKE SAND IN EM AND SHE RUBBED AND RUBBED TO THREAD HER NEEDLE
HE DON'T EVER GET BLACK WHY THEY ALL ASKED
WHILE THE OTHERS JUMPED TO THEIR FEET AND STOOD STARING
AND THEN IT WAS ALL CONFUSION AGAIN
AND WE BROUGHT EM OVER LAST EVENING WHEN YOU WERE ALL ABED
IT'S MOST LEVEN O'CLOCK SAID JOEL WHO HAVING NO WORK TO DO OUTSIDE THAT DAY WAS PRANCING AROUND WILD TO HELP ALONG THE FESTIVITIES
LET'S SEE--HERE'S A BIRD STORE
NOW CHILDREN WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT
THEY HAD SURELY THOUGHT JASPER WAS TO STAY A WEEK LONGER
THERE ISN'T ANY ROOM NOR ANY MORE PAPER EITHER--WHAT SHALL I DO
OH NOW THAT'S TOO BAD SAID JASPER
WHAT YOU GOIN TO DO PHRONSIE I WANT TO KISS IT GOOD NIGHT SAID THE CHILD WITH EYES BIG WITH ANTICIPATION AND HAPPINESS HUGGING THE WELL WORN TOE OF THE LITTLE OLD STOCKING AFFECTIONATELY
AND SITTING DOWN ON THE FLOOR HE BEGAN TO TIE AND UNTIE HIS NEW POSSESSIONS
DON'T YOU WISH POLLY SAID LITTLE PHRONSIE BUSTLING AROUND WITH A VERY IMPORTANT AIR NEARLY SMOTHERED IN THE DEPTHS OF A BIG BROWN APRON THAT POLLY HAD CAREFULLY TIED UNDER HER CHIN THAT YOU DIDN'T EVER-AN'-EVER HAVE SO MANY DISHES TO DO UM--MAYBE SAID POLLY THOUGHTLESSLY
I'M NOT GOING TO STAY
WELL THE FACT OF IT IS I'M GOING TO HAVE THEM HERE FOR A VISIT--THE WHOLE OF THEM YOU UNDERSTAND
OH SAID POLLY AND THEN SHE STOPPED AND THE COLOR FLUSHED UP INTO HER FACE
JOEL AND DAVID CALLED POLLY AGAIN IN HER LOUDEST TONES
AND I COULDN'T THINK OF BEING WITHOUT POLLY
AND THEN SHE TOLD HIM HOW SHE'D FORGOTTEN CHERRY'S SEED AND ALL ABOUT IT
BUT THIS ONLY PROVED FRESH FUEL FOR THE FIRE OF VAN'S INDIGNATION
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW SPLENDID PRINCE HAS BEEN NOR AND THEN SUCH A BREAKFAST CONTINUED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
A LARGE HANDSOME OLD GENTLEMAN WHOSE WHOLE BEARING SHOWED PLAINLY THAT PERSONAL COMFORT HAD ALWAYS BEEN HIS AND WAS THEREFORE NEITHER A MATTER OF SURPRISE NOR THANKFULNESS
THEY AREN'T UP-STAIRS SCREAMED VAN IN SCORN BOUNDING INTO THE HALL
WIPE UP POLLY
HOWEVER THE NEXT MORNING THEY SET OFF HAPPY IN THEIR HOPES AND BEARING THE COUNTLESS MESSAGES WHICH THE CHILDREN WOULD COME UP EVERY NOW AND THEN TO INTRUST TO THEM DECLARING THAT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN TO PUT THEM IN THE LETTERS
WHILE THE OTHERS FREED FROM ALL RESTRAINT WERE CHATTING AND LAUGHING HAPPILY TILL SOME OF THE CHEERINESS OVERFLOWED AND WARMED THE HEART OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN
I'VE PLAYED EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE FELLOW NO BIGGER'N PHRONSIE OH JASPER CRIED POLLY CLASPING HER HANDS HER CHEEKS ALL AFLAME--"DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU DO REALLY AND TRULY PLAY ON THE PIANO WHY YES SAID THE BOY LOOKING INTO HER FLASHING EYES
FLOWERS AREN'T ANYTHING SAID PERCY PLEASANTLY
LOOK HE WHISPERED TO DAVIE SEE POLLY SHE'S WRITING CROOKED SO WHILE THE OTHERS HUNG AROUND HER AND LOOKED OVER HER SHOULDER WHILE THEY MADE THEIR VARIOUS COMMENTS POLLY FINISHED HER PART AND ALSO HELD IT UP FOR INSPECTION
THEN WHY NOT SAY FINE COMMENTED BEN PRACTICALLY WITH A LITTLE UPWARD LIFT OF HIS NOSE
WE'LL HANG IT RIGHT UP I'LL HANG IT SAID DAVIE CLATTERING OFF DOWN THE STAIRS WITH A WILL
BUT DEAR ME CRIED POLLY SPRINGING UP THE CHILDREN ARE COMING
AND LEAVING THE GROUP HE RUSHED UP TO HER SIDE
I TOLD HER TWOULD JUST STOP POLLY FROM EVER BEING A MUSICIAN IF SHE BROKE OFF NOW--AND SO TWOULD YOU KNOW YOURSELF MARIAN FOR WE SHOULD NEVER GET THE CHILD HERE AGAIN IF WE LET HER GO NOW
OH NOW THAT'S TOO BAD HE CRIED SEEING POLLY FOLD UP THE REMAINING BITS OF CLOTH AND PICK UP THE SCRAPS ON THE FLOOR
BEN'LL TEACH YOU JOE SAID HIS MOTHER EAGERLY AND THEN I'LL LET YOU WRITE I WILL CRIED JOE
BEN MADE HIM HAVE YOU SAID MRS PEPPER TAKING OFF HER SHAWL AND LAYING HER PARCEL OF WORK DOWN ON THE TABLE NOW THAT'S NICE OH MAMMY CRIED POLLY IT DOES SEEM SO GOOD TO BE ALL TOGETHER AGAIN AND I THANK THE LORD SAID MRS PEPPER LOOKING DOWN ON HER HAPPY LITTLE GROUP
POLLY SAID MRS PEPPER HADN'T YOU BETTER STOP A LITTLE
THERE'S NO NECESSITY FOR ALL THIS PRATING ABOUT TRAINS LATE I'M CONVINCED IT'S BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO SEND DOWN FOR THE PAPERS TILL THEY WERE ALL SOLD I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S IT FATHER SAID THE BOY TRYING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT
HE'LL LIKE THAT BEST MAMSIE SAID POLLY WE CAN'T LET HER MAKE A DREADFUL HORRID GINGERBREAD BOY TO SEND MR KING
THERE SHE IS HE ROARED AND THE DRIVER WHO HAD HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND WAS FULLY IN SYMPATHY PULLED UP SO SUDDENLY THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN FLEW OVER INTO THE OPPOSITE SEAT
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO HAVE FOR BREAKFAST SAME AS EVER SAID HIS MOTHER
MRS PEPPER SIR SAID MRS PEPPER TRYING TO ANSWER WHICH SHE COULDN'T DO VERY WELL SURROUNDED AS SHE WAS BY THE CROWD OF LITTLE CHATTERERS
THERE NOW SEE IT CAN'T RAIN YET AWHILE WELL SAID MRS PEPPER WHILE PHRONSIE STANDING IN A CHAIR WITH HER FACE PRESSED CLOSE TO THE CAGE WAS TELLING CHERRY THROUGH THE BARS NOT TO BE HUNGRY PLEASE DON'T WHICH HE DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND IN THE LEAST BUT WENT ON SCREAMING HARDER THAN EVER
FOLKS WHO DO SO NEVER HAVE ANY CANDLES SHE ADDED SENTENTIOUSLY
ALSO LESSONS IN THE SCHOOLROOM UNDER THE BOYS PRIVATE TUTOR--IT WAS ALL OF NO AVAIL
BAD NAUGHTY OLD RAIN SHE SAID AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO CRY AS HARD AS SHE COULD
THAT ISN'T THE WAY SAID PERCY CROWDING UP THE BRIGHTNESS THAT HAD FLASHED OVER HIS FACE AT POLLY'S APPEARANCE BEGINNING TO FADE
A GRATEFUL APPRECIATIVE LETTER EXPRESSED IN MRS PEPPER'S OWN STIFF WAY PLAINLY SHOWED THE DETERMINATION OF THAT GOOD WOMAN NOT TO ACCEPT WHAT WAS SUCH A FAVOR TO HER CHILD
THE LITTLE PEPPERS WERE VERY LONELY AFTER JASPER HAD GONE
I WANT TO SIT UP LIKE POLLY DON'T TEASE HER WHISPERED POLLY TO BEN WHO THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO GO
NOW YOU CAN EAT FIT FOR A KING THAT LITTLE BIRD CERTAINLY PERFORMED ITS MISSION IN LIFE
THEY ALL STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A MOMENT
NOT ONE BIT YOU NEEDN'T GO YET PHRONSIE SAID POLLY
I DIDN'T SAY JASPER SHE REPEATED EMPHATICALLY
I'M GOIN TO TELL HER STORIES MA CRIED BEN SO YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT US ISN'T IT FUNNY BEN SAID POLLY AS THE GATE CLICKED AFTER THE MOTHER TO BE SITTING STILL AND TELLING STORIES IN THE DAYTIME RATHER FUNNY REPLIED BEN
TWAS PRINCE I GUESS YOU NEVER'LL KNOW HOW MUCH YOU DID DO SAID MRS PEPPER
AND HE FLUNG HIMSELF INTO POLLY'S LAP IN A PERFECT TORRENT OF TEARS
IT BEGAN WITH HER BOOTS
BUT--WELL YOU WON'T EVER HAVE THE MEASLES AGAIN I S'POSE AND THAT'S SOME COMFORT LITTLE DAVID WHO HAD BEEN NEARLY STUNNED BY THE SICKNESS THAT HAD LAID ASIDE HIS ALMOST CONSTANT COMPANION COULD EXPRESS HIS SATISFACTION AND JOY IN NO OTHER WAY THAN BY RUNNING EVERY THIRD MINUTE AND BEGGING TO DO SOMETHING FOR HIM
WHAT IS IT SHE ASKED POINTING TO THE CORNER WHILE ALL THE CHILDREN STOOD ROUND IN THE GREATEST EXCITEMENT
DON'T GO SAID THE CHILD AS SHE PUT UP HER LITTLE LIPS IN GRAVE CONFIDENCE
TELL AT ONCE FEELING AS IF SOMEBODY DIDN'T TELL PRETTY QUICK SHE SHOULD TUMBLE OVER WELL SAID JOEL GATHERING HIMSELF UP WITH A FRESH EFFORT THE OLD HAMMER WAS A-SHAKING AND PHRONSIE STUCK HER FOOT IN THE WAY--AND--I COULDN'T HELP IT POLLY--NO I JUST COULDN'T POLLY QUICK AS A FLASH POLLY TORE OFF THE LITTLE OLD SHOE AND WELL-WORN STOCKING AND BROUGHT TO LIGHT PHRONSIE'S FAT LITTLE FOOT
SEE POLLY'S STOVE CRIED PHRONSIE WISHING TO ENTERTAIN IN HER TURN
HIS EYES SPARKLING AS HE FLUNG BACK THE DARK HAIR FROM HIS FOREHEAD
TAKE CARE POLLY YOU BROKE THAT
POLLY PUT HER HAND IN HIS AND RECEIVED A HEARTY SHAKE
YOU'LL SWEEP BETTER NEXT TIME
SHE LOOKED WORN AND WORRIED
JUST LOOK AT HER FACE AND TO BE SURE OUR POLLY'S FACE WAS A STUDY TO BEHOLD
BUT THE TOAST WAS HARD AND DRY AND SHE CRIED HARDER THAN BEFORE
EVERYTHING HAD BEEN SO ENCOURAGING ON HIS LAST VISIT THAT HE HAD COME VERY NEAR PROMISING POLLY SPEEDY FREEDOM FROM THE HATEFUL BANDAGE
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING TO DO ANYTHING WITH AND WITH A FLOUNCE POLLY SAT DOWN ON THE OLD WOODEN STOOL AND FOLDING HER HANDS LOOKED AT BEN IN A MOST DESPAIRING WAY

WHEN HE SAW HIS MOTHER RETRACE HER STEPS SUPPOSING HER YIELDING TO THE URGENT ENTREATIES THAT HE WAS SENDING AFTER HER TO STAY AT HOME THE CHILD SUDDENLY CHANGED HIS GOOD-BYES TO VOCIFEROUS HOWLS OF DELIGHT AND SPEEDILY BEGAN TO PLUNGE DOWN THE STAIRS TO WELCOME HER

SHE FLEW OVER THE OLD FLAT DOOR-STONE AND INTO THE BEDROOM WHERE SHE FLUNG HERSELF DOWN BETWEEN THE OLD BED AND PHRONSIE'S CRIB IN A SUDDEN TORRENT OF TEARS
IT'S PHRONSIE SAID THE MOTHER AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MATTER IS WITH HER

AND THEY WON'T BE TOO BIG WHEN THEY'RE DONE PERCY ALL HEMMED AND EVERYTHING
WE HAD SOMETHING TO EAT SAID DAVIE BY WAY OF EXPLANATION
WE CAN'T DO IT MAMMY SAID POLLY LOOKING AROUND ON ALL THE HAPPY FACES AND THEN UP AT CHERRY WHO WAS SINGING IN THE WINDOW AND WHO IMMEDIATELY SWELLED UP HIS LITTLE THROAT AND POURED OUT SUCH A MERRY BURST OF SONG THAT SHE HAD TO WAIT FOR HIM TO FINISH
DO GET OFF HER THINGS QUICK YES'M CRIED POLLY PICKING UP THE TUB AND GIVING TWO OR THREE QUICK SOPS TO THE FLOOR
THEN SHE SAID--"WHERE SHALL I GO OH RUN TO DR FISHER'S
CAUSE THEY'RE ALL STUFFED--SO THERE NOW AIN'T THEY ALIVE--NOR ANYTHIN ASKED JOEL BRINGING ONE BLACK EYE INTO SIGHT FROM BEHIND HIS CHUBBY HANDS
I'M SURE I DON'T CARE--I'LL WRITE MYSELF AND I HAD BETTER DO IT NOW

I WISH SHE WAS MY SISTER HE FINISHED LONGINGLY

AND THEN HE BROKE OUT INTO A LOUD BURST OF MERRIMENT IN WHICH ALL THE TROOP JOINED UNTIL THE BIG ROOM ECHOED WITH THE SOUND
I RECEIVED A TELEGRAM THIS MORNING THAT I MUST BE IN THE CITY ON THURSDAY
POLLY BUT POLLY WAS ALREADY BY THE DOOR WITH DISH-CLOTH IN HAND

I DON'T KNOW MA'AM SAID POLLY
THAT'S SOMETHING LIKE
AND THE PEPPERS WENT INTO THEIR LITTLE BROWN HOUSE AND SHUT THE DOOR
JUST SEE HIM A MAN WITH AN ORGAN WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD PLAYING AWAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND AT THE END OF A LONG ROPE WAS A LIVELY LITTLE MONKEY IN A BRIGHT RED COAT AND A SMART COCKED HAT
BUT STILL BEN LINGERED
FOR SHE FELL ASLEEP--THE FIRST SLEEP SHE HAD HAD SINCE JOEY WAS TAKEN SICK
I GUESS THE CAKES'LL HAVE TO GO WITHOUT EM I SUPPOSE THEY WILL SAID POLLY STIFLING A LITTLE SIGH
I WISH WE'D BEEN THERE TOO WE DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY BUT JAPPY SAID JOEL NOT VERY POLITELY
SHE HAS REALLY JAPPY ALMOST ALL THE MORNING
FOREVER AND EVER FOREVER AN EVER ECHOED LITTLE PHRONSIE FLYING UP HER CHEEKS LIKE TWO PINKS AND SERAPHINA IN HER ARMS WITH HER BONNET ON UPSIDE DOWN
NOW SAID PHRONSIE COMING UP TO THE TABLE AND STANDING ON TIP-TOE TO SEE POLLY MEASURE OUT THE FLOUR I'M A-GOIN TO BAKE SOMETHING FOR MY SICK MAN I AM OH NO PHRONSIE YOU CAN'T BEGAN POLLY

PHRONSIE SICK
I CAN GET IT THERE AND OUT SHE PATTERED OVER THE SOFT CARPET TO THE TABLE AT THE END OF THE LONG HALL WHERE JANE OFTEN PLACED THE CHILDREN'S PLAYTHINGS OVER NIGHT
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN IT RAINED AND HE COULDN'T GO OUT AND WORK AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO DO IN THE HOUSE--THEN WE'D HAVE--OH AND SHE DREW A LONG BREATH AT THE MEMORY SUCH A TIME YOU CAN'T THINK DIDN'T YOU WISH IT WOULD ALWAYS RAIN ASKED VAN STILL GAZING AT THE PICTURE
THEN YOU'LL BE ALL FRESH AND RESTED TO SEE MAMMY WHEN SHE DOES COME OH NO SAID PHRONSIE SHAKING HER HEAD SOBERLY AND SPEAKING IN AN INJURED TONE
POLLY STITCHED AWAY BRAVELY
AND I KNOW THE WAY I DO TRULY SHE GOT UP AND WENT TO THE WINDOW WHERE SHE THOUGHT A MINUTE
HERE TIS AND HE PULLED OUT A SPLENDID LONG WHISTLE ON WHICH HE BLEW A BLAST LONG AND TERRIBLE AND JOEL IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING ALL QUIET WAS BROKEN UP AND THE WILDEST HILARITY REIGNED
FATHER KNEW HOW TO DO IT BUT POLLY'S ARMS WERE AROUND THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S NECK SO SHE DIDN'T HEAR
THEN HER EYE FELL ON JASPER WHO STOOD RESPECTFULLY WAITING AND WATCHING HER WITH GREAT INTEREST
HER POCKET WAS EMPTY
JUST AT THAT MOMENT A QUEER NOISE OUT IN THE KITCHEN WAS HEARD
WE'VE CALLED HER I GUESS A MILLION TIMES AND SHE WON'T HURRY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAVE HER DO ASKED JASPER LOOKING UP FROM THE SOFA WHERE HE HAD FLUNG HIMSELF WITH A BOOK
IT'S ALL WASHED OUT SAID POLLY SMOOTHING IT OUT WHEN YOU STAID OUT IN THE RAIN PHRONSIE'S FACE GREW VERY GRAVE AT THAT
AND THEN THERE'LL BE A HEAVY BILL TO PAY
AND THE CAKES WERE ROYAL
HE SAID I COULDN'T AND SO WE CAME OUT AND OH VANNY SAID MRS WHITNEY REPROACHFULLY TO TREAT A LITTLE GUEST IN THIS WAY I WANTED TO SAID JOEL CHEERFULLY
NOW SAID THE KIND TONES BRISKLY COME LITTLE GIRL WE'LL MAKE THIS ALL RIGHT SPEEDILY

I KNOW HE SAID
LET'S TRY AND GET A CELEBRATION SOMEHOW FOR MAMSIE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT ASKED BEN WHO WAS OF A DECIDEDLY PRACTICAL TURN OF MIND AND THUS COULDN'T ALWAYS FOLLOW POLLY IN HER FLIGHTS OF IMAGINATION
AND NOW SHE CAME INTO THE KITCHEN AND SET DOWN HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE
HOW COULD YOU DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER
LET US SEE DO BEN WHAT IS IT EXCLAIMED VAN SQUEEZING IN BETWEEN PERCY AND BEN
AN EXAMPLE WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THE WHITNEY BOYS AND THE TWO LITTLE PEPPERS
NOTHING BROKE DOWN MRS PEPPER'S RESOLVE UNTIL AT LAST THE OLD GENTLEMAN WROTE ONE DAY THAT JASPER BEING IN SUCH FAILING HEALTH REALLY DEPENDED ON POLLY TO CHEER HIM UP
WELL SHE'S A NICE CHILD HE SAID A VERY NICE CHILD
BUT AT THE END OF THESE EXPLORATIONS MIRANDY'S WEDDING CAKE WAS FURTHER OFF THAN EVER
AND THEN THEY ALL TOOK HOLD OF HANDS AND DANCED AROUND IT LIKE WILD LITTLE THINGS
OH DEAR SAID PHRONSIE SUDDENLY TURNING OVER WITH A LITTLE SIGH AND BOBBING UP HER HEAD TO LOOK AT POLLY
AND I'M A HATEFUL CROSS OLD BEAR SO I AM SHE CRIED REMORSEFULLY BUTTONING HERSELF INTO HER BOOTS
IT'S MRS BEEBE
DON'T GO
IT SOUNDS SOMETHING LIKE IT DON'T IT MAMMY SAID BEN UNWILLING TO GIVE HER PAIN BUT APPEALING TO MRS PEPPER
OH SAID PHRONSIE POPPING UP HER HEAD AND LOOKING AT HIM
THE LITTLE MAN LOOKED AT HER KEENLY OVER HIS SPECTACLES
IT CAN'T BE CHRISTMAS ALL THE TIME I WISH TWAS SAID LITTLE DAVIE
AND THEY'LL ALL BE OLD WHEN I TAKE HIM--AND--AND--OH
AND MRS HENDERSON WENT UP-STAIRS INTO THE LOFT
HIS LEG IS CROOKED SEE PHRONSIE--YOU BETTER LET DAVIE AN ME HAVE IT NO NO SCREAMED THE CHILD IN TERROR
YOU'VE KEPT HIM GOING ALL DAY TOO SHE ADDED GLANCING AT DAVID'S PALE FACE
THE HOUSE COULDN'T HOLD EM WOULDN'T LONG RESPONDED JOEL
EVEN JAPPY'S ISN'T BETTER I DON'T BELIEVE I WISH JAPPY WAS HERE SAID POLLY WITH A SMALL SIGH
ONE LITTLE HAND STOLE AROUND THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S NECK AND PATTED HIS CHEEK SOFTLY WHICH SO PLEASED HIM THAT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO HE STOOD PERFECTLY STILL SO THAT EVERYBODY MIGHT SEE IT
WELL THEN AND THERE WAS A WHISPERED CONFERENCE WITH PHRONSIE THAT SOMEHOW SENT THAT DAMSEL INTO A BLISSFUL STATE OF DELIGHT
THAT'S JUST LIKE A GIRL'S KNOTS WHY DIDN'T YOU TIE IT THEN SAID POLLY
THEY BOTH WERE OBLIGED TO THINK OF IT
AND I ASKED HIM AND HE SAYS IT'S FINE AND LOVELY AND ALL THAT ANSWERED POLLY DELIGHTED THAT SHE KNEW SOMETHING SHE COULD REALLY TELL BEN
YOU SEE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE YOUNGSTER AND YOU WERE JOHN WHITNEY THEN PUT IN MRS PEPPER SLYLY
MEANING AT SOME FUTURE TIME TO INDULGE IN ANOTHER PLUM-PUDDING THAT THE CHILDREN SO LOVED
IF I'D BEEN HERE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GOT AWAY I GUESS WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE ASKED VAN BRISTLING UP AT THIS REFLECTION ON THEIR COURAGE AND SQUARING UP TO HIM
DON'T BE AFRAID
TO HAVE TO CUT MORE OF THOSE TIRESOME OLD THINGS
HASN'T ANY BODY BROUGHT IT YET HERE TIS SIR SAID JANE HANDING HIM A GENEROUS SUPPLY
WHO'S TALKING OF IMPOSING SAID MR KING IN A LOUD KEY
BEN'LL GET WELL PRETTY SOON AND THEN WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT MAYBE SAID MRS PEPPER
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF THINK OF BY-AND-BY POLLY PUT IN BEN PATTING HER ON THE BACK WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND WHILE JOEL VARIED THE PROCEEDINGS BY RUNNING BACK AND FORTH SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS THE STAGE'S GOING
OH DEAR SAID JOEL AT LAST SHAKING HIS STOCKING
PRE-CISELY SAID POLLY WITH A PIN IN HER MOUTH
AND LITTLE DICK POKED HIS HEAD OUT FROM MRS PEPPER'S ARMS WHEN HE SAW HIS MAMMA SITTING DOWN TO STAY AND BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE DOWN TO GET INTO HER LAP
IT CAN'T DO ANY HARM ANYWAY--AND INSTEAD OF MR KING'S NOT LETTING JASPER COME IF HE'S A SENSIBLE MAN THAT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
COME ON JOE
AND SHE HAD SEEN WITH PRIDE THAT COULDN'T BE CONCEALED HER NOISY HAPPY BROOD GROWING UP AROUND HER AND FILLING HER HEART WITH COMFORT AND MAKING THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE FAIRLY RING WITH JOLLITY AND FUN
I'M MOST AFRAID IT WILL RAIN POLLY OH NO MAMSIE CRIED POLLY FEELING AS IF SHE COULD FLY TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO ATONE AND LONGING BESIDE FOR THE BRISK WALK DOWN TOWN
I DON'T SEE ANY MARY BARTLETT
OH SUCH A LONG STORY FATHER HE CRIED FLUSHED
ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS A GREAT RUSTLING IN CHERRY'S CAGE THAT SWUNG IN THE BIG WINDOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM
WHERE YOU BEEN ASKED ONE
VERY BAD INDEED HE ADDED
WHY WITH A SMALL CRY BUT GLADSOME AND DISTINCT IN ITS UTTERANCE PHRONSIE GAVE ONE LOOK--"OH GRANDPA WAS ALL SHE COULD SAY
A GOOD CHILD NEVER IS IMPERTINENT POLLY SAT QUITE STILL
NO SAID VAN THEY WON'T BITE--WHAT'S THE MATTER JOE OH THEY MAY SAID JOEL HIS FACE WORKING AND SCREWING BOTH FISTS INTO HIS EYES
AND THEN PHRONSIE BEHIND HIM BEGAN
WHAT IS IT PHRONSIE ASKED POLLY WHO WAS BUSTLING AROUND MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR THE CAKE-MAKING
HOW'D YOU DO IT BEN I DON'T KNOW REPLIED BEN WITH A SMILE CAREFULLY SHADING IN A FEW LAST TOUCHES
HO
THAT IS LAUGHING I DO THIS SUMMER
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
THAT WAS FINALLY DECIDED AS MRS PEPPER SHOWED THE CHILDREN HOW UTTERLY USELESS IT WOULD BE TO TRY HAVING IT IN THE KITCHEN
I KNOW IT'S A WEEK SHE SAID SINCE DINNERTIME
AND JUST THINK MAMMY NO BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND POLLY LOOKED AROUND ON THE OTHERS
TWO DARK FIGURES BIG AND POWERFUL WERE BENDING OVER SOMETHING THAT PHRONSIE COULDN'T SEE BETWEEN THE TWO BIG WINDOWS
SO HE SAID KINDLY AS AFTER PATTING PHRONSIE'S HEAD HE CAME OVER AND SAT DOWN BY POLLY THIS IS THE LITTLE GIRL WHO CAME TO SEE ME WHEN I WAS SICK OH SIR SAID POLLY I'M SO GLAD YOU WASN'T WELL WHEN I COME AGAIN SAID MR HENDERSON RISING AFTER A MERRY CHAT I SEE I SHALL HAVE TO SLIP A BOOK INTO MY POCKET AND READ FOR THOSE POOR EYES OH THANK YOU CRIED POLLY
TENDERLY TAKING HOLD OF THE WHITE TOES THE BOYS CLUSTERING AROUND IN THE GREATEST ANXIETY SHE WORKED THEM BACK AND FORTH AND UP AND DOWN
I THOUGHT TWAS DONE HOW'D YOU S'POSE HE'D GET IT ASKED BEN COOLLY BEGINNING THE M I DON'T KNOW REPLIED POLLY LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER
I'VE BEEN SICK--REAL SICK HE ADDED LIFTING HIS CHUBBY FACE TO HIS MOTHER TO IMPRESS THE FACT
WE'D BETTER BEGIN RIGHT AWAY POLLY WELL ALL RIGHT SAID POLLY WHO COULD SCARCELY KEEP HER FINGERS STILL AS SHE THOUGHT OF THE MANY THINGS SHE SHOULD SO LOVE TO DO IF SHE COULD
BEN GRASPING THE PEN AGAIN HERE GOES FOR THE DIRECTION
I DON'T KNOW AS I'M GOING TO DO ANYTHING YET SAID POOR MRS PEPPER WHO WAS ALMOST STUNNED
BUT POLLY'S BROWN HEAD WITH ITS CROWD OF ANTICIPATIONS AND BUSY PLANS WAS AWAY OFF IN DREAMLAND AND SHE BREATHED ON AND ON PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS
AND THEN JOEL GOT NAUGHTY
SOMETHING ELSE STOOD IN ITS PLACE A SHINY BLACK AFFAIR WITH A GENEROUS SUPPLY OF OVEN DOORS AND ALTOGETHER SUCH A COMFORTABLE HOME-LIKE LOOK ABOUT IT AS IF IT WOULD SAY--"I'M GOING TO MAKE SUNSHINE IN THIS HOUSE OH JOEL CRIED HIS MOTHER TURNING AROUND ON HIM WITH VERY BLACK HANDS YOU HAVEN'T TOLD NO SAID JOEL BUT SHE'S HEARIN THE NOISE POLLY IS HUSH SAID BEN TO ONE OF THE MEN
I'M AFRAID THOSE WOULDN'T QUITE ANSWER THE PURPOSE SAID HIS MAMMA SMILING--"ESPECIALLY THE LAST
SO SHE TOOK UP THE BROOM AND SENT IT ENERGETICALLY AND MERRILY FLYING AWAY TO THE TUNE OF HER OWN HAPPY THOUGHTS
ALL RIGHT--NOW SO AT IT THEY WENT
POLLY'S DISMAL MORNING EVERYTHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH POLLY THAT DAY
THE CHILDREN ALL HAD TO PLAY CLAP IN AND CLAP OUT IN THE BEDROOM WHILE IT CAME
STILL THE CLOUD HOVERED DARK AND FORBIDDING
A CAKE GRANDMA A BIG ONE A CAKE EXCLAIMED GRANDMA DROPPING THE BROOM TO SETTLE HER CAP WHICH POLLY IN HER EXTREME ENDEAVORS TO CARRY ON THE CONVERSATION HAD KNOCKED SLIGHTLY AWRY
NO NO CHILD SHE REPEATED
YES HERE I AM SAID JASPER
JOEL WAS ENGAGED IN THE PLEASING OCCUPATION OF SEEING HOW FAR HE COULD RUN HIS HEAD INTO THE BIGGEST OVEN AND THEN PULLING IT OUT TO EXHIBIT ITS BLACKNESS THUS ENGROSSING THE OTHERS IN A PERFECT HUBBUB
NOW HEAR WHAT PAPA IS GOING TO SAY WELL I WAS SENT UP INTO VERMONT TO STAY AT THE OLD PLACE
ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT MY MA'S MRS PEPPER SAID POLLY
LET US SEE SAID BEN TAKING IT UP
TO SUIT POLLY--"OH SHE SCREAMED
AND WITH MY STATE OF HEALTH TOO IT'S OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE TROUBLED
AND POTS OF LOVELY CLIMBING FERNS AND ALL MANNER OF PRETTY GREEN THINGS HAD BEEN ARRANGED AND RE-ARRANGED A DOZEN TIMES TILL EVERYTHING WAS PRONOUNCED PERFECT
JOLLY
UP THE BROAD OAK STAIRCASE THEY WENT POLLY HOLDING BY MRS WHITNEY'S SOFT HAND AS IF FOR DEAR LIFE AND JASPER TRIPPING UP TWO STEPS AT A TIME IN FRONT OF THEM
I'LL TELL POLLY

MA SCREAMED JOEL RUNNING TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS LEADING TO THE LOFT WHERE MRS PEPPER WAS WITH BEN
MAMSIE AND THE BOYS
TAIN'T ANY MATTER SAID MRS BASCOM KINDLY CATCHING SIGHT OF POLLY'S DISCOMFITED FACE
YOU'LL BE TIRED TO DEATH PHRONSIE SHE SAID LOOKING UP AT THE SMALL FIGURE ON ITS TOILSOME JOURNEY
NOBODY SAW THE LITTLE FIGURE GOING DOWN THE CARRIAGE DRIVE SO OF COURSE NOBODY COULD STOP HER
HE CAME ALONG WHEN WE WERE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
WAIT TILL THEY'RE DONE
FOR PHRONSIE FROM ONE WHO ENJOYED HER GINGERBREAD BOY AFTER THAT NOBODY HAD ANYTHING TO SAY
THESE SURPRISES AREN'T THE RIGHT SORT OF THINGS AND HE BEGAN TO FEEL VIGOROUSLY OF HIS HEART
SHE WAS A BIG WOMAN WITH SHARP BLACK EYES AND SPECTACLES--OVER WHICH SHE LOOKED--WHICH TO POLLY WAS MUCH WORSE FOR THAT GAVE HER FOUR EYES

POLLY CLEARED OFF THE DESERTED TABLE--FOR ONCE JOEL HAD ALL THE BREAD AND BUTTER HE WANTED

BUT AND HE BRIGHTENED UP AT SIGHT OF POLLY'S FORLORN VISAGE--"SEE YOU DO YOUR PART BY KEEPING STILL BUT THERE CAME A DAY SOON WHEN EVERYTHING WAS STILL AROUND THE ONCE HAPPY LITTLE BROWN HOUSE--WHEN ONLY WHISPERS WERE HEARD FROM WHITE LIPS
THE DREADFUL SAID GRANDMA
IS THIS LITTLE MISS PEPPER HE ASKED POMPOUSLY OF POLLY WHO ANSWERED HIS RAP ON THE DOOR
DON'T YOU KNOW WE ALL THINK YOU'RE AS GOOD AS GOLD THE DOG SUBMITTED TO THE ASTONISHING PROCEEDING AS IF HE LIKED IT WHILE JASPER DELIGHTED WITH POLLY'S APPRECIATION BEAMED DOWN ON THEM AND STRUCK UP FRIENDSHIP WITH HER ON THE INSTANT

OH--DEARY ME AND SHE RUSHED OUT INTO THE HALL AND BEGAN TO TUG VIOLENTLY AT THE BIG BUNDLE TOSSED DOWN IN A CORNER
MAKING HAPPINESS FOR MAMSIE AND SO THE MINUTE HER MOTHER HAD DEPARTED FOR THE MINISTER'S HOUSE NEXT MORNING AND BEN HAD GONE TO HIS DAY'S WORK CHOPPING WOOD FOR DEACON BLODGETT POLLY ASSEMBLED HER FORCE AROUND THE OLD STOVE AND PROCEEDED TO BUSINESS

YES INDEED SAID POLLY I GUESS YOU'D THINK SO IF YOU COULD SEE HER I KNOW WHAT I SHALL DO WITH A DIGNIFIED AIR SAID PERCY WHO COULDN'T DRAW AND THEREFORE LOOKED DOWN ON ALL VAN'S ATTEMPTS WITH THE GREATEST SCORN
DON'T YOU WANT BEN TO TELL US A STORY OH YES CRIED LITTLE PHRONSIE IN WHICH ALL THE OTHERS JOINED WITH A WHOOP OF DELIGHT
THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE BEN WAS OUT BY THE WOOD-PILE TRYING TO BREAK UP SOME KINDLINGS FOR POLLY WHO WAS WASHING UP THE DISHES AND OTHERWISE PREPARING FOR THE DELIGHTS OF BAKING DAY
WE'LL TELL HER HOW IT WAS AND SHE SAT DOWN IN THE FIRST CHAIR THAT SHE COULD REACH
THEY TURNED AFTER REACHING THE TOP DOWN A HALL SOFT TO THE FOOT AND BRIGHTLY LIGHTED
WHAT ASKED POLLY STOPPING WITH A DISH OF COLD POTATOES IN HER HAND
AND FATHER I DO BELIEVE THEY'LL REPAY YOU
I'M SORRY I CAN'T HELP YOU DO THE DISHES POLLY SAID DAVID RUNNING AFTER JOEL
OR STAY FATHER
ONE WAS JOEL AND THE OTHER UNMISTAKABLY WAS PHRONSIE
I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAMMY
AND SHE SAT DOWN AND PULLED OFF THE WELL-WORN SHOES INTO WHICH A BIG POOL OF DISH-WATER HAD RUN WHILE POLLY WENT FOR DRY STOCKINGS
WASN'T IT FUN POLLY I GUESS TWAS LAUGHED POLLY BACK AGAIN PLEASED AT THE RETURN OF SUNSHINE
NOW WHERE WILL YOU SIT DEAR SHE ADDED LOOKING DOWN ON THE LITTLE QUIET FIGURE BESIDE HER
WELL PROFESSOR BEN YOU'VE GOT TO TEACH ME THEN FOR I'M COMING TOO YOU SAID BEN TURNING AROUND HIS CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
AND THEN JASPER AND SHE TOOK HOLD OF HANDS AND HAD A GOOD SPIN
AND BESIDES THE SIGHT OF SO MANY BIRDS EATING THEIR SUPPERS OUT OF GENEROUSLY FULL SEED-CUPS ONLY FILLED HER HEART WITH REMORSE AS SHE THOUGHT OF POOR CHERRY AND HIS EMPTY ONE
WHEN SHE SAW POLLY COMING SHE STOPPED AND LEANED ON HER BROOM
WE CAN'T HELP IT BUT SHE LOOKED SO SORROWFUL OVER IT THAT HALF THE PLEASURE WAS GONE FOR BEN
IT'S JUST JOLLY SAID BEN COMING IN HIS CHUBBY FACE ALL AGLOW AND HIS BIG BLUE EYES SHINING SO HONEST AND TRUE
YES I WILL AND YOU'RE THE BEST CHILD CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN CATCHING HER UP AND MARCHING OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHERE THERE WAS A LOUNGING CHAIR
THAT'S JUST WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO HOH HOH SHOUTED VAN
SO FOR THE NEXT FEW MOMENTS NOTHING WAS HEARD BUT THE PULLING OUT OF THE OLD TABLE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR THE LAYING THE CLOTH AND ALL THE OTHER BUSTLE ATTENDANT UPON THE BEING READY FOR BEN
WHY SHE'S GOT ONE OH SAID THE CHILD IT WON'T BURN
AS SPRING ADVANCED HIS FATHER TOOK A DECIDED AVERSION TO HINGHAM BADGERTOWN AND ALL OTHER PLACES THAT COULD BE MENTIONED IN THAT VICINITY
AND THERE THEY WATCHED AND WATCHED AND WAITED
GEE-WHOA AND JOEL PRANCED WITH HIS IMAGINARY STEEDS ALL AROUND THE ROOM MAKING ABOUT AS MUCH NOISE AS ANY OTHER FOUR BOYS AS HE BROUGHT UP OCCASIONALLY AGAINST THE FOUR-POSTER OR THE HIGH OLD BUREAU
WELL I DECLARE AND THEN HE STOPPED AGAIN
I WON'T HE CRIED IN THE GREATEST ALARM RUNNING UP TO HER AS SHE STOOD BY THE DOOR
BOYS CALLED POLLY
YOUR FRIEND JASPER ELYOT KING OH LOVELY
NOW FOR A GOOD CHOP HE CRIED AND SNATCHING A KISS FROM PHRONSIE HE RUSHED OUT OF THE DOOR TO HIS WORK WHISTLING AS HE WENT
AND THEN THEY CAME OUT ON THE WET SLIPPERY STREET AGAIN
IT WAS A GOOD INSPIRATON THOUGHT MRS WHITNEY TO HERSELF
I DON'T KNOW DUBIOUSLY REPLIED MRS PEPPER
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING BEN PEPPER SO THERE
HER BRIGHT BLACK EYES GLISTENING WITH DELIGHT AS THE NOISY TROOP FILED BACK TO THEIR BREAD AND POTATOES

I'M HERE POLLY BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK
NO WE'D KEEP EM ALWAYS NO YOU DON'T WANT TO SAID MRS PEPPER COMING OUT OF THE BEDROOM IN TIME TO CATCH THE LAST WORDS
THEY WANTED TO COME THIS YEAR AWFULLY
SO HE SCARCELY EVER WENT OUT WITHOUT BRINGING HOME ONE AT LEAST TO ADD TO THEM UNTIL PHRONSIE HAD SUCH A REMARKABLE COLLECTION AS WOULD HAVE DRIVEN ALMOST ANY OTHER CHILD NEARLY CRAZY WITH DELIGHT
AND THEN THEY STOPPED RIGHT AT THE PEPPERS LITTLE BROWN GATE
OH DEAR ME MAMSIE WHAT SHALL I DO RUN RIGHT ALONG SAID MRS PEPPER BRISKLY
IF MY EYES WERE HURT I'D GIVE UP SO WOULD I SAID DAVID
I HOPE NOT MY LITTLE GIRL HE SMILED BACK ENCOURAGINGLY

THE HATE-FULLEST HORRIDEST MEASLES
YES THEY'RE RIGHT IN HERE SAID GRANDMA WADDLING BACK WITH AN OLD TIN TEAPOT IN HER HAND;--"GOODNESS CHILD
SHE CAN BAKE IT AND DAVE AN I'LL EAT IT AND HE PICKED UP A RAISIN THAT HAD FALLEN UNDER THE TABLE AND BEGAN CRUNCHING IT WITH GREAT GUSTO
YOU NEVER'LL GET IT OPEN AT THIS RATE BUT AT LAST IT WAS CUT
HIT AS HARD AS YOU'VE A-MIND TO SAID JOEL I'M A-GOING TO OH YOU MAY SAID VAN POLITELY BECAUSE YOU'RE COMPANY
WELL WELL SHE CRIED MERRILY LOOKING AT THE SWARM OF LITTLE ONES AROUND MRS PEPPER AND THE BIG CHAIR

OH TELL ABOUT HIM POLLY DO YES YES PHRONSIE SAID POLLY WE WILL--WHY TELL HIM HOW WE WISH HE COULD HAVE COME AND THAT WE BAKED HIM SOME CAKES AND THAT WE DO SO WANT HIM TO COME JUST AS SOON AS HE CAN ALL RIGHT SAID BEN
BUT SEEING EVERYTHING PROGRESSING FINELY AND OVERCOME BY HER EXTREME DESIRE TO SEE JAPPY AND PRINCE SHE BEGAN BY PEEPING OUT WITH BIG EYES TO OBSERVE HOW THINGS WERE GOING ON
AND THEN FRIGHTENED LEST IN SOME HILARIOUS MOMENT THE SECRET SHOULD POP OUT THE TWO CONSPIRATORS WOULD BETAKE THEMSELVES TO THE WOOD-SHED AS BEFORE AGREED ON
OH BEN SHE CRIED FLINGING HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND BURSTING INTO TEARS
BLESS HER THOUGHT MRS PEPPER TO HERSELF OUT IN THE KITCHEN FINISHING THE SACK POLLY HAD LEFT

LIE DOWN AGAIN THEN FLINGING HIMSELF DOWN ON THE GRASS HE TOLD BEN HOW HE CAME TO RESCUE PHRONSIE
AND POLLY TIED ONE OF HER MOTHER'S AMPLE APRONS ON JASPER AS MRS PEPPER HAD LEFT DIRECTIONS IF HE SHOULD COME WHILE SHE WAS AWAY
BUT EVEN WITH THE MUSIC AND FLOWERS THE DANCING LIGHT IN THE EYES WENT DOWN A LITTLE
THERE SHE SAID DRAWING IT MILDLY OVER THE FEW BITS SHE COULD SCRAPE TOGETHER AND GENTLY COAXING THEM INTO A LITTLE HEAP
N-NO SAID THE CHILD EYING IT SUSPICIOUSLY
BUT PHRONSIE'S CHIEF OCCUPATION AT LEAST WHEN SHE WASN'T WITH POLLY WAS THE ENTERTAINMENT AND AMUSEMENT OF MR KING
SO THEY HAVE ASSENTED MR KING AND THEN THE CONVERSATION DROPPED
GOODNESS SAID POLLY TAKING HER HEAD OUT OF THE OLD CUPBOARD IN THE CORNER HOW YOU SCARED ME PHRONSIE WOULD THEY EVER GO OUT ASKED THE CHILD GRAVELY STILL STANDING WHERE POLLY LEFT HER
SO UP THE STAIRS TRUDGED THE TWO BOYS AND PRESENTED THEMSELVES RATHER SHEEPISHLY BEFORE THE BIG CHAIR
AND EVERYTHING WAS AS STILL AS A MOUSE
OH YOU CAN'T THINK MAMMA WELL NOW SAID HIS MAMMA DO GO ON AND LET ME HEAR SOME OF THE NICE TIMES SO AWAY THEY LAUNCHED AGAIN AND MRS WHITNEY WAS SOON ENJOYING IT AS HUGELY AS THE CHILDREN WHEN A HEAVY STEP SOUNDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND A VOICE SPOKE IN SUCH A TONE THAT EVERYBODY SKIPPED

AND MRS PEPPER WITH HER BIG MENDING BASKET WAS ENSCONCED OVER BY THE DEEP WINDOW SEAT JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM UNDERNEATH CHERRY'S CAGE AND LOOKING UP BETWEEN QUICK ENERGETIC STITCHES OVER AT THE BUSY GROUP WITH THE MOST PLACID EXPRESSION ON HER FACE

FOR THIS BROTHER AND SISTER WERE EVERYTHING TO EACH OTHER AND STOOD LOYALLY TOGETHER THROUGH THICK AND THIN POLLY WAS TEN AND BEN ONE YEAR OLDER
THERE NOW--THERE'S A LOT MORE
AND THE LIFE AND SPIRIT OF THE LETTER WAS SO CATCHING THAT POLLY AND BEN FOUND THEIR SOULS FIRED WITHIN THEM TO TRY AT LEAST TO GET FOR THE LITTLE ONES A TASTE OF CHRISTMASTIDE
AREN'T YOU ASHAMED JOEL SAID HIS MOTHER TO TALK ABOUT ANY ONE WHOSE BACK IS TURNED

WHY TWOULD BE JUST LIKE HEAVEN POLLY
FOR ALTHOUGH A DREADFUL FEELING TUGGED AT HER HEART AS SHE THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE SHE WAS FAST FLYING AWAY FROM THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE
WHAT ARE YOU DOING GASPED POLLY HOLDING ON TO A CHAIR

ANYBODY CAN GO OUT AND LOOK AT A TREE OUTDOORS WELL NOW I TELL YOU POLLY SAID BEN SITTING DOWN ON THE FLOOR BESIDE HER AND SPEAKING VERY SLOWLY AND DECISIVELY WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING CAUSE WE'VE BEGUN
A BOY WITH THOSE EYES CAN'T HELP BUT BE GOOD HER EYES ARE JUST THE SAME AS POLLY'S THOUGHT JASPER JUST SUCH LAUGHING ONES ONLY POLLY'S ARE BROWN AND HE LIKED HER ON THE SPOT
AND THEN SHE'LL FEEL BAD IN THE MORNING
AND THEN THE KITCHEN WAS IN AN UPROAR AS THE PRECIOUS MISSIVE WAS PUT INTO POLLY'S HAND
I KNOW--I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT--I DO BEG YOUR PARDON AND RUNNING TO THE STOVE HE KNELT DOWN AND DREW OUT OF THE OVEN A BLACK ODOROUS MASS WHICH WITH A CREST-FALLEN AIR HE BROUGHT TO POLLY
BE SPRY THEN JOE AND CATCH IT AT THE CORNER EVERYBODY SOON KNEW THAT LITTLE PHRONSIE PEPPER HAD GONE OFF WITH A CROSS ORGAN MAN AND AN AWFUL MONKEY AND IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR DOZENS OF PEOPLE WERE OUT ON THE HOT DUSTY ROADS IN SEARCH
AND TOPS AND BALLS AND FISHING POLES SENT JOEL AND DAVID INTO A CORNER WITH HOWLS OF DELIGHT
THEN AS THE DOOR CLOSED HE SAID TO HIS SON THAT PAYS ONE FOR COMING TO SUCH AN OUT-OF-THE-WAY COUNTRY PLACE AS THIS AWAY FROM PAPERS--I NEVER WILL DO IT AGAIN AS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AGAINST THE ADVICE OF MANY FRIENDS WHO KNEW HIS DEPENDENCE ON EXTERNALS HAD DETERMINED TO COME TO THIS VERY PLACE THE BOY WAS NOT MUCH STARTLED AT THE DECISIVE WORDS
SO AMID NODS AND SHAKINGS OF HANDS THE BEEBES DROVE OFF AND QUIET SETTLED DOWN OVER THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE AGAIN
FOLLOW MAMSIE DOWN THE STAIRS THEY WENT WITH MILITARY STEP AND INTO THE PROVISION ROOM
WELL I HOPE SO SAID BEN TOSSING HER HIGHER YET

I WISH TWAS TO-NIGHT FOR WE'RE ALL READY SANTY'S COMING

PHRONSIE SHE CALLED WITH A MERRY LITTLE LAUGH WHERE HUSH SAID MR KING WARNINGLY AND THEN JUST BECAUSE HE COULDN'T EXPLAIN THERE WITHOUT WAKING PHRONSIE UP HE TOOK HOLD OF POLLY'S TWO SHOULDERS AND MARCHED HER INTO THE NEXT ROOM WHERE HE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR AND TOLD HER THE WHOLE THING USING HIS OWN DISCRETION ABOUT THE VERY NARROW ESCAPE SHE HAD PASSED THROUGH
AND ONE MORNING HE ASTONISHED THEM ALL BY TURNING OVER SUDDENLY AND EXCLAIMING
YOU SEE I WAS A VERY LITTLE GIRL AND WAS YOU EVER LITTLE INTERRUPTED JOEL IN EXTREME INCREDULITY DRAWING NEAR AND LOOKING OVER THE BIG SQUARE FIGURE
AT WHICH THEY ALL SCREAMED

MONSIEUR TOURTELOTTE AFTER WATCHING HER KEENLY OUT OF HIS LITTLE BLACK EYES WOULD NOD TO HIMSELF LIKE A MANDARIN AND THE NOD WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY SHOWERS OF EXTRA POLITENESS AS HIS APPRECIATION OF HER PATIENT ENERGY AND ATTENTION

FULL OF ANTICIPATIONS OF CHRISTMAS HIMSELF HE URGED THE LITTLE PEPPERS TO TRY FOR ONE
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO FOR THE DOCTOR POLLY AND JUST AS FAST AS YOU CAN POLLY STILL STOOD HOLDING THE BOWL AND STARING WITH ALL HER MIGHT
WHAT HAS MRS PEPPER BEEN TELLING YOU OH THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE CRIED DICKY HIS CHEEKS ALL A-FLAME
HEY ASKED JOEL WITH A DAUB OF FLOUR ON THE TIP OF HIS CHUBBY NOSE GAINED BY TOO MUCH PEERING INTO POLLY'S FLOUR-BAG
PHRONSIE IMMEDIATELY LEFT BEN WHO WAS HANGING OVER POLLY AS IF HE NEVER MEANT TO LET HER GO OUT OF HIS SIGHT AGAIN AND WENT DIRECTLY OVER TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S SIDE
AT LAST IT WAS OFF AND WITH INTENSE SATISFACTION THE CHILDREN WATCHED BEN DISAPPEAR WITH IT DOWN THE LONG HILL TO DEACON BLODGETT'S

AND STOOD AS IF FROZEN TO THE SPOT TILL PHRONSIE MOVING ONE STEP FORWARD PIPED FORTH
WHAT'S THE MATTER OH PHRONSIE'S BEEN GOING SO SAID POLLY LOOKING UP AT THE LITTLE FIGURE ABOVE THEM WHICH HAD NEARLY REACHED THE TOP IN DELIGHT THAT I CAN'T STOP HER

THEREUPON A SMALL FIGHT ENSUED BETWEEN THE LITTLE WHITNEYS WHILE JASPER LOOKED DECIDEDLY DISCOMFITED
FOR SHE JUST GAVE ONE GAZE AT THE TREE AND THEN SAT RIGHT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND SAID OH
FLINGING THE RECEET ON THE TABLE SHE RUSHED UP TO THE OLD CHAIR AND WAS DOWN ON HER KNEES BEFORE IT HER ARMS AROUND THE LITTLE FIGURE
AND THERE WAS A KINDER RING TO HER VOICE THAN EVER

BUT BE SURE JASPER AND SHE LAID HER HAND ON HIS ARM AS SHE LOOKED DOWN INTO HIS EYES THAT YOU FATHER IS WILLING THAT'S ALL OH YES MA'AM SAID THE BOY
BUT JOEL FINDING THIS OUT FOLLOWED THEM ONE DAY--OR AS POLLY SAID TAGGED--SO THAT WAS NO GOOD
WAIT
YOU'LL CATCH COLD OUT HERE
NOW I TELL YOU HE SAID YOU MUST NOT TAKE OFF THAT BANDAGE AGAIN
BUT PHRONSIE NEVER HEARD THE LAST OF HIS OBSERVATIONS FOR IN A MINUTE SHE WAS FAST ASLEEP
SHE HAS STRAINED THEM IN SOME WAY BUT SHE WILL COME OUT OF IT PRAISE THE LORD CRIED MRS PEPPER THROWING HER APRON OVER HER HEAD
WILL THEY COME ASKED MRS WHITNEY DOUBTFULLY
HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE THEN MUSTN'T I GO AND SEE HIM NOW JASPER
AND THIS ENDED IN THREE GOOD CHEERS--PHRONSIE COMING IN TOO LATE WITH HER LITTLE CROW--WHICH WAS JUST AS WELL HOWEVER
YOU MAY HAVE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT OF THE OLD ISN'T THERE ANY MOLASSES MAMMY ASKED JOEL AS SHE BADE POLLY GOOD-BYE
WELL THEY WON'T ANYWAY SAID VAN DECIDEDLY
MR KING HAD BEEN NERVOUSLY PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET DURING THE LAST FEW MOMENTS THAT THE CHILDREN WERE TOGETHER
YOU'D SPILL THE BREAD AND BUTTER ALL OVER HER I WOULDN'T EITHER SAID LITTLE DICK INDIGNANTLY AND BEGINNING TO CRAWL INTO HIS SEAT
IF YOU SAY SO SAID THE BOY AS IF MR ATKINS HAD GIVEN HIM SOMETHING OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET
OH BEN
TAKE ME--POLLY I THOUGHT SO LAUGHED POLLY AND BUNDLED HER OFF INTO THE BEDROOM
AND THERE WASN'T A MAN WOMAN OR CHILD BUT WHAT GREATLY REJOICED THAT A SUNNY TIME WAS COMING TO ONE OF THE CHICKS IN THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE
HE DID EXCLAIMED JOEL LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER AT A WONDERFUL VIEW OF A DOG IN AN EXTREMELY EXCITED STATE OF MIND RUNNING DOWN AN INTERMINABLE HILL TO BARK AT A LOCOMOTIVE AND TRAIN OF CARS WHIZZING ALONG A CURVE IN THE FOREGROUND
THERE SHE STOPPED PERFECTLY STILL
BUT THE BOY WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SUMMER AND SO HELD ON BRAVELY
AND HE PULLED OUT HER CHAIR AND WAITED UPON HER INTO IT SO HANDSOMELY THAT POLLY WAS HAPPY AT ONCE
NO NOT IF WE TRIED A THOUSAND YEARS I'M A-GOIN SAID JOEL WHO WAS BUSY AS A BEE WITH HIS NEW TOOLS THAT THE TREE HAD SHAKEN DOWN FOR HIM TO MAKE JAPPY THE SPLENDIDEST BOX YOU EVER SAW POLLY
AND NOW WITH HER ARMS AT JUST SUCH AN ANGLE WITH THE STIFF CHUBBY FINGERS KEPT UNDER TRAINING AND RESTRAINT--WELL POLLY REALIZED YEARS AFTER THAT ONLY HER LOVE OF THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE COULD EVER HAVE KEPT HER FROM FLYING UP AND SPINNING AROUND IN PERFECT DESPAIR
THE PAPER HASN'T COME--STRANGE INDEED THAT ONE MUST NEEDS BE SO ANNOYED
BUT BABY WAS CROSS AND WOULDN'T GO TO SLEEP AND PHRONSIE WAS ON THE POINT OF GIVING UP AND RETURNING TO THE HOUSE WHEN A STRAIN OF MUSIC MADE HER PAUSE WITH DOLLY IN HER APRON
THERE'S PERCY AND VAN AND LITTLE DICK--OH HE'S SO CUNNING SHE CRIED IMPULSIVELY
MAKE HIM BE OURS MORE PAPA DO AND THEN POLLY SPRANG UP
SEEMING TO CARE FOR NOTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD BUT TO WORK HER WAY UP TO THE TOP OF THE LONG FLIGHT ONLY TO TURN AND COME DOWN AGAIN
HAVE GOOD THINGS CRIED THE CHILD IN DELIGHT AT UNDERSTANDING THE OTHERS I WOULD REALLY BEN SHE CRIED GRAVELY WHEN THEY ALL SCREAMED
I KNOW IT SAID POLLY AND I'M SO GLAD JOEL I DON'T SUPPOSE I'LL EVER GET SO MANY AGAIN OBSERVED JOEL REFLECTIVELY AFTER A MINUTE'S PAUSE AS ONE AND ANOTHER OF THE WONDROUS DELICACIES ROSE BEFORE HIS MIND'S EYE
WHAT GASPED POLLY AND GOT NO FURTHER
AND THEN IT ALL TUMBLES OUT QUICK
MARIAN OUGHT TO SEE THAT THERE'S SOME HERE--THAT STUPID JANE AND IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT HE WAS FUSSING HERE AND THERE KNOCKING DOWN SO MANY THINGS IN GENERAL THAT THE NOISE SOON BROUGHT POLLY TO WITH A LITTLE GASP
ONLY IT WOULDN'T COME
MY SISTER'S GONE OFF WITH A MONKEY EXPLAINED JOEL BOBBING OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE AS HE THOUGHT HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOMETHING PINK THAT HE FELT SURE MUST BE PHRONSIE'S APRON
WHEN POLLY FIRST HEARD IT BY PHRONSIE'S PATTERING DOWNSTAIRS AND SCREAMING
THE FIRST THING POLLY DID IN THE MORNING WAS TO RUN TO THE OLD CUPBOARD FOLLOWED BY ALL THE OTHERS TO SEE IF THE CAKE WAS SAFE
SOMEBODY ELSE ASK HER I CAN'T TALK HOW DID THEIR FACES LOOK PHRONSIE DEAR ASKED JASPER TAKING ONE OF THE COLD HANDS IN HIS
NO I GUESS I DIDN'T
OF COURSE SAID MR KING SHARPLY THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER WAY
DO COME JASPER DO WELL MAYBE SAID JASPER IF FATHER LIKES IT AND SISTER MARIAN AND HER FAMILY WILL COME WITH US
THERE NOW I'LL SHOW YOU
JOEL AND I TOOK IT TO MAKE KITES WITH OH DEAR GROANED POLLY
THERE TAKE CARE PHRONSIE
JAPPY SAID THE STRANGER STILL STANDING AS IF PETRIFIED
I'M GOIN UP-STAIRS AND HE SPRANG UP AND ENERGETICALLY PRANCED TO THE STAIRS
WITH A START THEY BROUGHT THEMSELVES UP AND STARED--ONLY TO SEE A LITTLE WHITE-ROBED FIGURE WITH ITS ASTONISHED EYES UPLIFTED WITH CHILDLIKE EARNEST GAZE AS SHE WAITED FOR HER ANSWER
WHAT PHRONSIE WHY THE CANDLES SAID THE CHILD THE EVER-AN'-EVER SO MANY PRETTY LIGHTS OH MY SENSES CRIED POLLY WITH A LITTLE LAUGH HAVEN'T YOU FORGOTTEN THAT
HE LEFT HER SITTING STRAIGHT UP AMONG HER PARCELS HER STURDY LITTLE FIGURE DRAWN UP TO ITS FULL HEIGHT AND THE CLEAR BROWN EYES REGAINING A LITTLE OF THEIR DANCING LIGHT
WHAT DID SHE SAY POLLY WATCHING HER SHAKE THE CLOUDS OF FLOUR IN THE SIEVE
IT'S ALL RUBBED OUT SAID POLLY PEERING AT IT YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING DO OPEN IT SAID BEN AND THEN YOU'LL FIND OUT BUT P'RAPS TISN'T FOR ME SAID POLLY TIMIDLY
BEN IN THE MEANTIME HAD BEEN INITIATING JASPER INTO THE MYSTERIES OF CUTTING THE WOOD THE TOOL-HOUSE AND ALL THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE THEY HAD RECEIVED A RE-INFORCEMENT IN THE ADVENT OF JOEL AND DAVID WHO STARED DELIGHTEDLY AT PHRONSIE'S PROTECTOR MADE FRIENDS WITH THE DOG AND ALTOGETHER HAD HAD SUCH A THOROUGHLY GOOD TIME THAT PHRONSIE COMING BACK CLAPPED HER HANDS IN GLEE TO HEAR THEM
SOMETIMES I DO PUT THINGS AWAY SO'S TO HAVE EM SAFE SO POLLY GOT AN OLD WOODEN CHAIR ACCORDING TO DIRECTION AND THEN MOUNTED UP ON IT WITH GRANDMA BELOW TO DIRECT SHE HANDED DOWN BOWL AFTER BOWL INTERSPERSED AT THE RIGHT INTERVALS WITH CRACKED TEACUPS AND HANDLELESS PITCHERS
AND BEFORE ANY ONE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT SHE TRIPPED RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE OVER THE PAPERS AND EVERYTHING AND GAVE A HAPPY LITTLE WHIRL
AND CAN'T WE BAKE SOMETHING THEN MAMMY I'M SURE I DON'T CARE LAUGHED MRS PEPPER
HOW HE BIT HIM
ONLY HER EYES HAD BOTHERED HER SO
CAN'T I TAKE THAT OH DEAR NO CRIED POLLY
THAT WOULD BE JUST DREADFUL I SHOULD THINK LIKELY LAUGHED BEN
AND DO CARVE A LITTLE BIRD LIKE THE ONE YOU DID ON YOUR FATHER'S I WILL SAID JASPER JUST EXACTLY LIKE IT
AND THEN THAT WONDERFUL TREE JUST RAINED DOWN ALL MANNER OF LOVELY FRUIT
I'M TIRED
POOR CHILD
I THINK EVERYTHING OF THEM AND I SHALL KEEP THEM AS LONG AS I LIVE VAN WELL THEN SAID VAN VERY MUCH PLEASED I SHALL PAINT YOU EVER SO MANY MORE--JUST AS MANY AS YOU WANT DO SAID MRS PEPPER TAKING UP HER WORK AGAIN
A BAD OLD WOMAN KNOCKED IT OFF WITH A BASKET--AND NOW MAMSIE WON'T GET HER LETTER AND SHE WAVED THE BIT WHICH SHE STILL GRASPED FIRMLY BETWEEN HER THUMB AND FINGER SADLY TOWARDS MRS WHITNEY
AND A GENTLEMAN'S VOICE SAID IN THE DEEPEST CONCERN
AND THE FIRELIGHT FROM THE DYING COALS MADE THE WHOLE STAND OUT DISTINCTLY TO THE GAZE OF THE MOTIONLESS LITTLE FIGURE
AND HE'S A SPLENDID FELLOW I JUST KNOW CRIED JASPER WAXING ENTHUSIASTIC
WELL THE FACT IS I'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WILL KEEP THIS HOUSE
NO TRACE COULD BE FOUND OF THE CHILD
BUT TWAS ALL OF NO USE
AND SOON THEY WERE IN SUCH A PEAL OF LAUGHTER AND HAD REACHED SUCH HEIGHTS OF ENJOYMENT THAT MR KING POPPED HIS HEAD IN AT THE DOOR AND THEN CAME IN AND TOOK A SEAT IN A BIG ROCKING-CHAIR IN THE CORNER TO HEAR THE FUN GO ON
WHERE YOU GOING JOE ASKED MRS PEPPER SEEING HIM MOVE OFF WITH MRS BASCOM
ONLY THE BEST OF EM ISN'T HERE OBSERVED VAN RATHER UNGALLANTLY HE DRAWS PERFECTLY ELEGANT PAPA I LIKE POLLY BEST I DO CRIED LITTLE DICK TUMBLING AFTER
I REALLY COULDN'T MAMMY--AND HE TALKED TO HER
I KNOW NO OTHER SUCH LITTLE AMERICANE I THINK SAID JASPER ONE EVENING AFTER DINNER WHEN ALL THE CHILDREN WERE ASSEMBLED AS USUAL IN THEIR FAVORITE PLACE ON THE BIG RUG IN FRONT OF THE FIRE IN THE LIBRARY PRINCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GROUP HIS HEAD ON HIS PAWS WATCHING EVERYTHING IN INFINITE SATISFACTION THAT POLLY'S GETTING ON IN MUSIC AS I NEVER SAW ANYONE DO
HE DID HAVE TWO SAID POLLY BUT SHE PUNCHED THE OTHER IN WITH HER THUMB

JUST AS ELEGANT AS EVER OH SAID PHRONSIE
SEE IF YOU'VE GOT SOME--LOOK QUICK YES I HAVE SAID DAVID PICKING UP A PARCEL ABOUT AS BIG
HOW COULD YOU TRY IT JOE I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAID JOEL LOOKING VERY DOWNCAST AND ASHAMED
SHE HOWEVER REGARDED THEM SOMETHING IN THE LIGHT OF A GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE TAKEN CARE OF TENDERLY TO BE WATCHED OVER CAREFULLY AS TO JUST THE RIGHT KIND OF BRINGING UP
WHY YOU'RE A BIG WOMAN DEAR ME YES SAID MRS PEPPER
WHAT DO YOU DO ALL DAY LONG SHE ASKED TURNING BACK TO POLLY AFTER A WITHERING GLANCE AT JOEL WHO STILL STARED
FOR BEN KNOWS
AND TO MAKE IT FUNNIER STILL SAID JASPER DON'T YOU THINK A LITTLE PEN-WIPER HE HAS MADE LIKE A CAP HANGING ON THE PEN-RACK ABOVE HIM TUMBLED OFF JUST AT THIS VERY IDENTICAL MINUTE RIGHT ON THE HEAD OF THE GINGERBREAD BOY AND THERE IT STUCK OH THEY ALL SCREAMED IF WE COULD ONLY HAVE SEEN IT WHAT WAS IT ASKED PHRONSIE PULLING POLLY'S SLEEVE TO MAKE HER HEAR
AND THEN MRS PEPPER CAME FORWARD AND JASPER INTRODUCED HER AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN BOWED AND SAT DOWN IN THE SEAT POLLY PLACED FOR HIM
BUT THE FIRST THING SHE KNEW A GENTLE BUT FIRM HAND WAS LAID UPON HERS
I HOPE YOUR CAKE AIN'T IN POLLY LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AT THE STOVE FOR I'VE FOUND IT AND SHE WAVED A SMALL PIECE OF PAPER TRIUMPHANTLY TOWARDS THE ROCKING-CHAIR AS SHE SPOKE

WELL I GUESS YOU BETTER RIDE UP ANYWAY POLLY COME TO THINK AND THEN YOU'LL GET HOME ALL THE QUICKER WHERE YOU GOING ASKED PHRONSIE WHO ON SEEING THE PURSE KNEW THERE WAS SOME EXPEDITION ON FOOT AND BEGINNING TO CLAMBER DOWN OUT OF THE CHAIR

PHRONSIE STILL STOOD JUST WHERE POLLY LEFT HER
SANTY'S COMING SANG PHRONSIE AS THE BRIGHT AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT WENT DOWN OVER THE FRESH CRISP SNOW FOR IT'S NIGHT NOW YES SANTA IS COMING SANG POLLY
PRINCE IS A NOBLE FELLOW HERE THE DOG'S EARS TWITCHED VERY PERCEPTIBLY AND HE KEPT AT THAT MAN
JASPER SET DOWN THE BAG ON A CHAIR AND CAME AND STOOD BY HIS SISTER'S SIDE LOOKING DOWN AT HER AS SHE STROKED THE BROWN WAVY HAIR ON HER BOSOM

OH DEAR SAID POLLY SITTING DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND PULLING ON HER STOCKINGS

MY SICK MAN I SHALL GIVE UP SAID POLLY TUMBLING OVER IN A CHAIR WITH THE CAKE SPOON IN HER HAND FROM WHICH A SMALL STICKY LUMP FELL ON HER APRON WHICH JOEL IMMEDIATELY POUNCED UPON AND DEVOURED
HE'D BE LIKELY TO GO THAT WAY NO ONE COULD TELL WHERE HE WOULD GO CRIED POLLY WRINGING HER HANDS
WHICH BROTHER PURSUED MISS JERUSHA LIKE A CENSUS-TAKER
WHY A MONKEY'S--A--MONKEY EXPLAINED POLLY I DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER'N THAT
I'M SURE HE WAS SAID MRS PEPPER
IT MUST GET INTO THIS MAIL WHEN MR KING HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO DO ANYTHING EVERYBODY ELSE MUST IMMEDIATELY GIVE UP THEIR INDIVIDUAL PLANS AND STAND OUT OF THE WAY FOR HIM TO EXECUTE HIS AT JUST THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT
OF HOW NICE IT WOULD BE TO GO OFF FOR JUST ONE DAY AND DO EXACTLY AS SHE HAD A MIND TO IN EVERYTHING
NOW IF I DO THIS GOOD MAMMY'LL LET ME DO IT OTHER TIMES SHE SAID TO HERSELF
WE MOST OF US KNEW YOU WERE SICK--I'M POLLY NOW--BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T COME
SO WHAT IS IT PHRONSIE GOT UP VERY GRAVELY AND WITH ONE SHOE HALF ON SHE LEANED OVER AND WHISPERED IN THE DOCTOR'S EAR
BESIDES I AM GOING TO HAVE HER TO MYSELF NOW OH NO NO CRIED LITTLE DICK IN ALARM
THEN HE BEGAN TO SHAKE HIS JACKET SLEEVE VIOLENTLY TO BRING HIM BACK TO REASON WAIT JOE
I WANT TO LEARN TOO AND ME CRIED DICK BENDING FORWARD NEARLY UPSETTING PHRONSIE AS HE DID SO
POLLY HAD JUST OPENED HER MOUTH TO TELL HER ERRAND WHEN THE DOOR ALSO OPENED SUDDENLY AND MR HENDERSON WALKED IN
HOW HE FELL SICK THEY SCARCELY KNEW IT ALL CAME SO SUDDENLY
BIRD-SEED GASPED POLLY
AND HE MARCHED UP TO THE PIANO PUFFING WITH HIS EXERTIONS
WITHIN THE ROOM THERE WAS SUNSHINE AND COMFORT IT BEING THE MOST LUXURIOUS ONE IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE PROPRIETOR HAD PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THIS MOST EXACTING GUEST
COME RIGHT BACK OR I'LL TELL MAMSIE THEY'RE ALL COMIN IN ANYWAY CRIED LITTLE DAVIE DELIGHTEDLY AND SCUTTLING OVER TO POLLY'S SIDE
NEVER MIND SAID POLLY TRYING TO GET HER BREATH JUST AS JASPER WAS RELATING HOW MR KING SET UP THE GINGERBREAD BOY ON HIS WRITING TABLE BEFORE HIM WHILE HE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR FOR A HEARTY LAUGH
OH PHRONSIE DARLING AND SHE BENT OVER THE CHILD IN HER FATHER'S ARMS AND NEARLY SMOTHERED HER WITH KISSES
WHY SAID POLLY HOW COULD I

NO INDEED HE WASN'T SAID JASPER
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D GO AND TUMBLE OVER POLLY I REALLY DIDN'T AND HE BEAMED ADMIRINGLY DOWN ON HER
AND THIS'LL MAKE YOU GROW PHRONSIE O-O-H AND PHRONSIE'S LITTLE WHITE TEETH SHUT DOWN QUICKLY ON THE COMFORTING MORSEL
POLLY DIDN'T SLEEP MUCH MORE ON HER SHAKE-DOWN ON THE FLOOR THAN IF SHE HAD WATCHED WITH BEN
AND MISS JERUSHA CONTINUED
PHRONSIE'S GOT EM AND THAT'S ENOUGH GOT WHAT ASKED BEN WHILE DAVIE'S EYES GREW TO THEIR WIDEST PROPORTIONS
I'LL TRUST HIM SHE SAID TO HERSELF
YOU CAN'T HAVE YOURS TILL DAVIE WAKES UP TOO
AND THEN HE FLEW OUT WHERE HIS MOTHER AND BEN AND TWO MEN WERE AT WORK ON A BIG BLACK THING IN THE CORNER
WHILE JASPER INSTEAD OF LAUGHING ONLY STARED
SO YOU'LL GO ALL STRAIGHT NOW

WELL ANYWAY I'D A-CAUGHT EM SO THERE HE SAID AS VAN AT LAST SHOWED SIGNS OF COMING OUT OF HIS FIT OF LAUGHTER AND GOT UP AND WIPED HIS EYES

THERE NOW WHO SAYS I CAN'T DO IT
I WANT TO SEE HIM WELL THERE HE IS CRIED BEN AS THE DOCTOR PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE GIG AND BOWED AND SMILED TO THE LITTLE GROUP IN THE WINDOW
OH I WANT TO GO TOO I DO

BUT SHE WOULD SEND IT
WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND VAN CAME TO A FULL STOP OF AMAZEMENT AND STARED AT THEM
MANY AND VAST WERE THEIR SECRET PLANS BY WHICH THEY WERE TO ASTONISH HER AT SOME FUTURE DAY WHICH THEY WOULD ONLY CONFIDE--AS THEY DID EVERYTHING ELSE--TO ONE ANOTHER
AND THEN WHEN THE WAY SEEMED CLEAR AGAIN THE STORE CHANGED HANDS SO THAT FOR A LONG TIME SHE FAILED TO GET HER USUAL SUPPLY OF SACKS AND COATS TO MAKE
AND IN ANOTHER SECOND POLLY AND HER BAG AND THE BUNDLE OF CAKES AND APPLES THAT GRANDMA BASCOM HAD PUT UP FOR HER AND JOEL'S BOX WERE ONE AND ALL BUNDLED OUT UPON THE PLATFORM AND THE TRAIN WHIZZED ON AND THERE MR KING WAS FUMING UP AND DOWN BERATING THE DEPARTING CONDUCTOR AND SPEAKING HIS MIND IN REGARD TO ALL THE RAILROAD OFFICIALS HE COULD THINK OF

MOTHER SAID POLLY TOWARDS EVENING I'M GOING TO SIT UP WITH BEN TO-NIGHT

AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO HE ADDED STARING AROUND ON THE ASTONISHED GROUP NONE OF WHOM HAD A WORD TO SAY
THEN MR KING SETTLED DOWN SATISFIED AND EVERYTHING WENT ON SMOOTHLY AS BEFORE
AND SOMETIMES POLLY CRIES SHE DOES WHEN SHE'S ALL ALONE--AND I SEE HER NOW SAID THE DOCTOR VERY SYMPATHETICALLY THAT'S TOO BAD
IT GOT TO BE NOTICED FINALLY

WHEN IT WAS OPENED THERE LAY A LITTLE BIRD DELICATELY ROASTED AND FOLDED IN A CLEAN NAPKIN

AND THEN THEY DON'T GO ALL OVER THE ROOM
SUCH A TIME AS WE'VE HAD TO MAKE IT I KNOW IT LAUGHED POLLY

SHE'S UP-STAIRS AND HE FLEW OUT IN A TWINKLING AND JUST AS SOON REAPPEARED WITH POLLY SCAMPERING AFTER HIM IN THE WILDEST EXCITEMENT
BUT LACKING THAT NECESSARY ACCOMPANIMENT PROBABLY WAS A SHORT-CAKE
COME IN CHILD SHE OPENED THE OTHER HALF OF THE BIG DOOR AND LED THE WAY THROUGH THE WIDE HALL INTO A BIG OLD-FASHIONED ROOM WITH PAINTED FLOOR AND HIGH OLD SIDE-BOARD AND SOME STIFF-BACKED ROCKING-CHAIRS
