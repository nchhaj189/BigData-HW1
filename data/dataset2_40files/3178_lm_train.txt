SELBY AND FAMILY
I SHOULDN'T THINK HE'D BE AT POKER OH ITS ONLY FIVE CENT ANTE JUST TO MAKE IT INTERESTING THE DELEGATE SAID BUT I SHOULDN'T THINK A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS WOULD PLAY POKER ANY WAY IN A PUBLIC STEAMBOAT NONSENSE YOU'VE GOT TO PASS THE TIME
YOU MUST NOT LOOK AT IT SO MR BOLTON WROTE HIM
HIS ACQUAINTANCES HAD BEEN KNOWN TO SAY THAT THEY INVARIABLY ALLOWED A HALF FOR SHRINKAGE IN HIS STATEMENTS AND HELD THE OTHER HALF UNDER ADVISEMENT FOR CONFIRMATION
AND THEIR SIGNATURES--WHY I CAN TELL THEIR INITIALS EVEN THE PRESIDENT WENT TO A PRIVATE SAFE UNLOCKED IT AND GOT OUT SOME LETTERS AND CERTAIN SLIPS OF PAPER
I WOULD MUCH RATHER TALK ABOUT MY BILL SO WOULD I NOW MY CLANDESTINE AMANUENSIS
SUCH A PITCH OF VIRTUE DOES NOT OCCUR OFTEN IN REAL LIFE ESPECIALLY IN SUCH NATURES AS HARRY'S WHOSE GENEROSITY AND UNSELFISHNESS WERE MATTERS OF TEMPERAMENT RATHER THAN HABITS OR PRINCIPLES
HE WANTED TO BE RICH HE HAD A SINCERE DESIRE FOR A FORTUNE BUT FOR SOME UNACCOUNTABLE REASON HE HESITATED ABOUT ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE NARROW WORK OF GETTING IT
I SHALL ASK FATHER TO BRING OUT DR JACKSON
PARTS OF THEM WERE MISSING AND IMPORTANT LETTERS WERE REFERRED TO THAT WERE NOT HERE
LAURA BADE HIM GOOD BYE WITH TENDER REGRET WHICH HOWEVER DID NOT DISTURB HER PEACE OR INTERFERE WITH HER PLANS
WHEN ONE THINKS OF THE TREMENDOUS FORCES OF THE UPPER AND THE NETHER WORLD WHICH PLAY FOR THE MASTERY OF THE SOUL OF A WOMAN DURING THE FEW YEARS IN WHICH SHE PASSES FROM PLASTIC GIRLHOOD TO THE RIPE MATURITY OF WOMANHOOD HE MAY WELL STAND IN AWE BEFORE THE MOMENTOUS DRAMA
THEY TOOK THE YOUNG AND THE AGED THE DECREPIT AND THE SICK UPON THEIR BACKS AND LEFT FOR TIDE-WATER IN DISORDERLY PROCESSION THE TADPOLES FOLLOWING AND THE BULL-FROGS BRINGING UP THE REAR
SELLERS HITCHED BACK HIS COAT SLEEVES AIRILY FROM HIS WRISTS AS WHO SHOULD SAY NOW FOR SOLID ENJOYMENT SEIZED A FORK FLOURISHED IT AND BEGAN TO HARPOON TURNIPS AND DEPOSIT THEM IN THE PLATES BEFORE HIM LET ME HELP YOU WASHINGTON--LAFAYETTE PASS THIS PLATE TO WASHINGTON--AH WELL WELL MY BOY THINGS ARE LOOKING PRETTY BRIGHT NOW I TELL YOU
PLARSTERIN SI CALLS IT THIS MARVEL WAS DISCUSSED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH
I TOOK NO NOTE OR RECEIPT FROM HIM AND MADE NO MEMORANDUM OF THE MATTER
WE'VE GOT THE ENTIRE CONTRACT FOR DOBSON'S PATENT PAVEMENT FOR THE CITY OF MOBILE
WHEN HE WAS ASKED AFTERWARDS ABOUT THE STOLEN COPY OF THE ALABAMA TREATY WHICH GOT INTO THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE HE ONLY LOOKED MYSTERIOUS AND SAID THAT NEITHER HE NOR SENATOR DILWORTHY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
A BOLD ONSLAUGHT IS WORTH TRYING
ONCE MORE LOUISE HAD GOOD NEWS FROM HER WASHINGTON--SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS GOING TO SELL THE TENNESSEE LAND TO THE GOVERNMENT
ABOUT THIS TIME A LETTER CAME SAYING THAT JUDGE HAWKINS HAD BEEN AILING FOR A FORTNIGHT AND WAS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE SERIOUSLY ILL
THEN HE WAS GOING TO BUILD IT OF COPPER ORE--SPLENDID YELLOW FORTY-PER-CENT
NEITHER ALICE NOR RUTH WERE MUCH ELATED WITH THE PROSPECT OF PHILIP'S RENEWAL OF HIS MINING ENTERPRISE
WHENEVER ANY OF US WAS IN TROUBLE YOU'VE DONE WHAT YOU COULD TO HELP US OUT
YOUR OLD HAND DON'T GO AROUND POW-WOWING AND LETTING EVERYBODY SEE HIS K'YARDS AND FIND OUT HIS LITTLE GAME
WHERE IS THAT APPROPRIATION?--IF A STOCKHOLDER MAY MAKE SO BOLD AS TO ASK THE APPROPRIATION?--THAT PALTRY $200,000 DO YOU MEAN OF COURSE--BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT $200,000 WAS SO VERY PALTRY
SHE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL WITH SELBY IN WASHINGTON APPEARED TO BE INFATUATED WITH HIM
HE COULD NOT KEEP FROM BUYING TRIFLES EVERY DAY THAT WERE NOT WHOLLY NECESSARY IT WAS SUCH A GAUDY THING TO GET OUT HIS BANK-BOOK AND DRAW A CHECK INSTEAD OF USING HIS OLD CUSTOMARY FORMULA CHARGE IT HARRY SOLD A LOT OR TWO ALSO--AND HAD A DINNER PARTY OR TWO AT HAWKEYE AND A GENERAL GOOD TIME WITH THE MONEY
I INTEND TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU WASHINGTON MY BOY
WELL THAT BEATS ME
I LOVE THEM JUST THE SAME AS I LOVE MY OWN
SELBY HAD FALLEN THROUGH
HE SAW THE FIRE LIGHT HE SAW THE CLEAR STARS THROUGH THE TREE-TOPS HE HEARD THE GURGLE OF THE STREAM THE STAMP OF THE HORSES THE OCCASIONAL BARKING OF THE DOG WHICH FOLLOWED THE COOK'S WAGON THE HOOTING OF AN OWL
IT'S ALL A CHANCE OF COURSE AND CHANCES HAVEN'T BEEN KIND TO US I'LL ADMIT--BUT WHATEVER COMES OLD WIFE THEY'RE PROVIDED FOR
HE WAS ONCE RUSTICATED HERE FOR A TERM RUSTICATED SUSPENDED FOR SOME COLLEGE SCRAPE
GO INTO THE OTHER CAR I DID NOT INTEND TO TAKE THE SEAT SAID THE LADY RISING I ONLY SAT DOWN A MOMENT TILL THE CONDUCTOR SHOULD COME AND GIVE ME A SEAT THERE AINT ANY
A COFFIN STOOD UPON TWO BACKLESS CHAIRS
EVERY PAY DAY HE SAW HIS FUNDS MELTING AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS ONLY THE FAINTEST SHOW OF WHAT THE MINERS CALL SIGNS THE LIFE SUITED HARRY WHOSE BUOYANT HOPEFULNESS WAS NEVER DISTURBED
NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING REALLY YOU KNOW AND A WOMAN CAN GUESS A GOOD DEAL NEARER THAN A MAN YOU ARE VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO MY SEX BUT SAID HARRY FRANKLY
HIS TITLE OF SQUIRE CAME INTO VOGUE AGAIN BUT ONLY FOR A SEASON
BUT THERE'LL BE PLENTY SOON--PLENTY LAURA REASONED WITH HERSELF THAT IF THE KINDLY SIMPLE-HEARTED COLONEL WAS GOING ANYHOW WHAT COULD SHE GAIN BY TRAVELING ALONE AND THROWING AWAY HIS COMPANY
IF HE HAD A WOMAN'S EYES HE WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT THE SPRAY OF BOX HAD GROWN THREE INCHES SINCE HE FIRST GAVE IT TO ME BUT A MAN NEVER SEES ANYTHING AND NEVER SUSPECTS
WHY DIDN'T SHE
SUDDENLY UNCLE DAN'L EXCLAIMED
THAT MAN IS UNSCRUPULOUS ENOUGH TO DO ANYTHING
THE STEAMSHIP SUBSIDY BILL WAS A FRAUD ON THE GOVERNMENT
NOT EVEN THE RELIGIOUS ATMOSPHERE OF SENATOR DILWORTHY'S HOUSE HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO INSTILL INTO LAURA THAT DEEP CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLE WHICH HAD BEEN SOMEHOW OMITTED IN HER TRAINING
I'D BE WILLING TO BET ANYTHING THAT THE VERY NEXT LETTER THAT COMES FROM HARRY WILL THE ELDEST BOY ENTERED JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME AND BROUGHT A LETTER WARM FROM THE POST-OFFICE
BUT HE IS RIGHT AT HEART
YOU WOULD NOT KNOW THAT OBEDSTOWN STOOD ON THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN FOR THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE TO INDICATE IT--BUT IT DID
I HAVE NOT ONLY BROUGHT OVER THE GREAT INVINCIBLE BUT THROUGH HIM A DOZEN MORE OF THE OPPOSITION
I AM CLEAR AT MY WIT'S END
AND THE CHILDREN CAN'T BE ANY WORSE OFF IN MISSOURI THAN THEY ARE HERE I RECKON MOTIONING HIS WIFE TO A PRIVATE CONFERENCE IN THEIR OWN ROOM HAWKINS SAID
THERE HOPPERSON'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO COUNT TWENTY THE SANCTIMONIOUS OLD CURMUDGEON
GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY
AND FINALLY AS IF STILL UNSATISFIED BURNED THE PAPER
SELLERS TO THE QUESTIONS OF THE COUNSEL OF COURSE YOUR HONOR
PENNYBACKER HAD BEEN THERE SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE WINTER AND HE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS INVOLVING MR BOLTON IN SOME DOUBTFUL SCHEME
HE'S TUCK AN FIXED UP THE OLE HOUSE LIKE THEY DOES IN KAINTUCK HE SAY AN THA'S BEN FOLKS COME CLER FROM TURPENTINE FOR TO SEE IT
AND IF I WERE TO EAT ALL THE DINNERS I AM INVITED TO I RECKON I'D WEAR MY TEETH DOWN LEVEL WITH MY GUMS IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS WELL I DO WONDER WHAT YOU WILL BE TO-MORROW
IT WAS WITH A FEELING OF TRIUMPH THAT LAURA REACHED HER HOTEL A SCORNFUL FEELING OF VICTORY OVER SOCIETY WITH ITS OWN WEAPONS
AND GONDERIL,'--I ASSURE YOU IT IS THE MOST SPLENDID BOOK I EVER READ
AND FOR ANY PERSON EXCEPT LAURA EITHER WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE HOUSEHOLD TO HAVE SUGGESTED SUCH AN IDEA WOULD HAVE BROUGHT UPON THE SUGGESTER THE SUSPICION OF BEING A LUNATIC
HIS GOOD NATURE WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND THOUGH HE LIKED TO RELATE HIS OWN EXPLOITS HE HAD A LITTLE TACT IN ADAPTING HIMSELF TO THE TASTES OF HIS HEARERS
WAL LEAST SAID'S SOONEST MENDED YOU HAINT NO CHANCE WITH THE COMPANY WHEN NEXT MORNING HE READ THE HUMOROUS ACCOUNT IN THE PATRIOT AND CLARION HE SAW STILL MORE CLEARLY WHAT CHANCE HE WOULD HAVE HAD BEFORE THE PUBLIC IN A FIGHT WITH THE RAILROAD COMPANY
ARE YOU
I HAVE BEEN MARRIED ONCE--IS THAT NOTHING IN MY FAVOR OH YES--THAT IS IT MAY BE AND IT MAY NOT BE
WHEN LAURA REACHED HOME SHE WAS TIRED BUT EXULTANT AND SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS PLEASED AND SATISFIED
POOR LITTLE CREATURE
HIS CASE IS NOT CONSIDERED DANGEROUS AT ALL
PERHAPS LAURA WAS OLDER THAN HARRY
ONLY A STATION PROBABLY
HE SCORNED AT ANY RATE TO ADVANCE HIS OWN INTEREST BY ANY DISPARAGING COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT HARRY BOTH BECAUSE HE COULD NOT HELP LIKING THE FELLOW HIMSELF AND BECAUSE HE MAY HAVE KNOWN THAT HE COULD NOT MORE SURELY CREATE A SYMPATHY FOR HIM IN RUTH'S MIND
YOU'LL BE FAMOUS WITHIN A FORTNIGHT LAURA
NEITHER AT HOME NOR ELSEWHERE DID RUTH UTTER ANY COMPLAINT OR ADMIT ANY WEARINESS OR DOUBT OF HER ABILITY TO PURSUE THE PATH SHE HAD MARKED OUT FOR HERSELF
HOUSE-BILL--NO
THAT SEAT'S TAKEN
THE FAMILIAR TUNE CAUGHT THE EAR OF THE MASS WHICH PAUSED IN WONDER AND GAVE THE CONDUCTOR'S VOICE A CHANCE TO BE HEARD--"IT'S A FALSE ALARM THE TUMULT WAS OVER IN A MINUTE AND THE NEXT LAUGHTER WAS HEARD AND NOT A FEW SAID I KNEW IT WASN'T ANYTHING WHAT FOOLS PEOPLE ARE AT SUCH A TIME THE CONCERT WAS OVER HOWEVER
THE RAILROAD WILL DO IT NAPOLEON WON'T KNOW ITSELF IN A YEAR DON'T NOW EVIDENTLY SAID PHILIP ASIDE TO HARRY
WHATEVER SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS NOT IDLY MUSING AS ONE MIGHT SEE BY THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE
QUEERER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED
AND IF YOU PAY FIFTEEN CENTS FOR REGISTERING IT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE EXTRA CARE OF IT AND EVEN PAY YOU BACK ITS FULL VALUE IF IT IS LOST
WOULDN'T DILWORTHY OPEN HIS EYES IF HE KNEW SOME OF THE THINGS BALLOON DID SAY TO ME
I AM LEAVING YOU IN CRUEL POVERTY
IT'S BREAD CAST UPON THE WATERS--IT'LL RETURN AFTER MANY DAYS SAID THE OLD LADY WHOM WE HAVE HEARD SPEAK BEFORE
ALL TRACE OF HIM ENDS AT THAT HOTEL IN NEW YORK
SIMONY IS WHAT I CALL IT SIMONY REPEATED MR BIGLER AS IF HE HAD SAID A GOOD THING
I USED TO BE SO PREJUDICED AGAINST COLOR DID YOU
HE WAS IN FACT MADLY IN LOVE WITH THIS WOMAN
IT MIGHT BE ASKED WHY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BUY THIS LAND WHEN IT HAD MILLIONS OF ACRES MORE THAN THE RAILROAD COMPANIES DESIRED WHICH IT MIGHT DEVOTE TO THIS PURPOSE
THEY HAD NO TROUBLESOME APPEARANCES TO KEEP UP NO RIVALRIES WHICH THEY CARED TO DISTRESS THEMSELVES ABOUT NO JEALOUSIES TO FRET OVER
IT WAS FROM SENATOR DILWORTHY WHO HAD APPEARED UPON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE FOR A MOMENT AND FLITTED AWAY AGAIN
WELL WELL WELL EVERYTHING IS SO UNCERTAIN AT LAST HE SAID
THE TRIAL WILL LAST TO THE MIDDLE OF MARCH SURE
WHEREUPON HARRY DISMISSED THE MATTER THEN AND THEREAFTER FROM HIS THOUGHTS AND LIKE A LIGHT-HEARTED GOOD FELLOW AS HE WAS GAVE HIMSELF NO MORE TROUBLE ABOUT HIS BOARD-BILLS
SUCH COATS AND VESTS AS DID APPEAR HOWEVER WERE RATHER PICTURESQUE THAN OTHERWISE FOR THEY WERE MADE OF TOLERABLY FANCIFUL PATTERNS OF CALICO--A FASHION WHICH PREVAILS THERETO THIS DAY AMONG THOSE OF THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE TASTES ABOVE THE COMMON LEVEL AND ARE ABLE TO AFFORD STYLE
I WILL GO
THEY TOOK A NEW INTEREST IN HIM
AS HER THOUGHTS RAN ON THE INDIGNANT TEARS WOULD SPRING TO HER EYES AND SHE WOULD SPIT OUT FIERCE LITTLE EJACULATIONS AT INTERVALS
BUT THEE WON'T SEE THERE A SWEETER WOMAN THAN MOTHER AND THEE WON'T GO WHY SHOULD I
THAT MEANT FORTUNE
SHE EVEN SAID THEE TO HIM ONCE IN REPROACH FOR A CUTTING SPEECH HE BEGAN
MR BOLTON TOLD HIM HE WAS VERY SORRY AND RECOMMENDED HIM TO SUE SMALL
WHEN THE REPORTER ASKED
MAYBE HE IS COMING HERE
YOU WOULDN'T
AND SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO SEE THAT THE DAPPER YOUNG SENATOR FROM IOWA CAME AT ONCE AND STOOD IN THE OPEN SPACE BEFORE THE PRESIDENT'S DESK TO EXHIBIT HIS FEET AS SOON AS SHE ENTERED THE GALLERY WHEREAS SHE HAD EARLY LEARNED FROM COMMON REPORT THAT HIS USUAL CUSTOM WAS TO PROP THEM ON HIS DESK AND ENJOY THEM HIMSELF WITH A SELFISH DISREGARD OF OTHER PEOPLE'S LONGINGS
BY AND BY I FLUNG OUT NEXT DOOR AND DRAGGED IN DR SPRAGUE
TOTAL FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND BOTTLES
THERE WAS A NOISE IN HIS EARS AS OF A RUSHING TORRENT WHEN A STREAM IS SWOLLEN BY A FRESHET IN THE SPRING
THIS ENFORCED WAITING AT ST LOUIS WAS VERY IRKSOME TO PHILIP
THE CONDUCTOR RED IN THE FACE AND PUFFING FROM HIS EXERTION SWAGGERED THROUGH THE CAR MUTTERING PUPPY I'LL LEARN HIM THE PASSENGERS WHEN HE HAD GONE WERE LOUD IN THEIR INDIGNATION AND TALKED ABOUT SIGNING A PROTEST BUT THEY DID NOTHING MORE THAN TALK
CONGRESS ADJOURNED AND HER BILL HAD FAILED TO PASS THE SENATE
I CAN SEE THAT HE DEPENDS GREATLY UPON WHAT THEE CAN DO
COME RIGHT ALONG TO MISSOURI
IT IS OWING TO A NEGLECT OF THE DOCTRINES THAT THERE IS SUCH A FEARFUL FALLING AWAY IN THE COUNTRY
SHAKE HANDS AGAIN
THE ORDERS WENT WELL ENOUGH FOR GROCERIES AND SUCH THINGS AT A FAIR DISCOUNT AND THE WORK DANCED ALONG GAILY FOR A TIME
CLAY'S HUNDRED AND EIGHTY OR NINETY DOLLARS HAD WORKED A WONDER
BUT I LOVE YOU THAT'S ALL
PHILIP LIKED THE LETTER AS HE DID EVERYTHING SHE DID
YOU SEE MR BOLTON HE SAID AND PHILIP WAS PRESENT AT THE CONVERSATION IT PUTS US ALL OUT
I HUNTED UP A PLACE FOR YOU YESTERDAY BUT I AM NOT REFERRING TO THAT,--NOW--THAT IS A MERE LIVELIHOOD--MERE BREAD AND BUTTER
AND AS FOR STATIONERY THERE WAS NO END TO IT
PHILIP TO KEEP HIM FROM SOME NEW FOOLISHNESS PERSUADED HIM TO GO WITH HIM TO PHILADELPHIA
AM I IN SOME STRANGE FOREIGN CLIME WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE MARVELS THAT WE KNOW NOT OF
OH THEE MUST GO BY ALL MEANS
WE HAVE WAITED PATIENTLY AND FAITHFULLY ALL THESE YEARS AND NOW AT LAST THE REWARD IS AT HAND
WELL I SWEAR JIM WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THAT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S THE MEANING OF IT
I WOULD SO LIKE TO GO TO FRANCE
YOU GO AHEAD SAID I--YOU CAN FIX IT--AND SO HE HAS
THIS GAVE HIM FAME AND GREAT RESPECTABILITY
HOW DOES THAT FRUIT STRIKE YOU WASHINGTON SAID HE DID NOT KNOW THAT HE HAD EVER TASTED BETTER
IT CAN BE DONE SIR
EVEN WITH THE LAW SHE COULD HAVE NO RIGHT TO STAND BETWEEN TWO SOULS THAT WERE ONE
POINT ARGUED
I TRUST HE SAID THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN WITHIN THE SOUND OF MY VOICE AND AFTER SOME REMARKS TO THEM THE SENATOR CLOSED WITH AN APOSTROPHE TO THE GENIUS OF AMERICAN LIBERTY WALKING WITH THE SUNDAY SCHOOL IN ONE HAND AND TEMPERANCE IN THE OTHER UP THE GLORIFIED STEPS OF THE NATIONAL CAPITOL COL
WASHINGTON HESITATED
OUR ADMIRABLE JURY SYSTEM ENABLED THE PERSECUTED EX-OFFICIALS TO SECURE A JURY OF NINE GENTLEMEN FROM A NEIGHBORING ASYLUM AND THREE GRADUATES FROM SING-SING AND PRESENTLY THEY WALKED FORTH WITH CHARACTERS VINDICATED
I'VE LET YOU SAY YOUR SAY--NOW LET ME SAY MINE
LAURA CONCLUDED AFTER REFLECTION TO LET CIRCUMSTANCES DETERMINE THE COURSE IT MIGHT BE BEST FOR HER TO PURSUE AS REGARDED THE SEVERAL ARISTOCRACIES
IN EXTRICATING HIMSELF MR HAWKINS WHO HAD THE CARE OF HIS HAT AS WELL AS THE INTRODUCTION ON HIS MIND SHAMBLED AGAINST MISS BLANCHE WHO SAID PARDON WITH THE PRETTIEST ACCENT AS IF THE AWKWARDNESS WERE HER OWN
THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME WILL BE WHEN THE FEVER LEAVES HER
NO PLACE OFFERED EQUAL FACILITIES FOR EXPERIMENTS IN MINING METALLURGY ENGINEERING
I DON'T KNOW ANY MAN IN CONGRESS I'D SOONER GO TO FOR HELP IN ANY CHRISTIAN WORK
RUTH IS A DEAR GIRL PHILIP AND HAS AS MUCH FIRMNESS OF PURPOSE AS EVER BUT DON'T YOU SEE SHE HAS JUST DISCOVERED THAT SHE IS FOND OF SOCIETY
SOMETIMES HE FELT HER HAND ON HIS FOREHEAD AND DID NOT OPEN HIS EYES FOR FEAR SHE WOULD TAKE IT AWAY
THEN SHE SAID
SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS LARGE AND PORTLY THOUGH NOT TALL--A PLEASANT SPOKEN MAN A POPULAR MAN WITH THE PEOPLE
EVEN THE PARLOR CARPET WAS FROM ST LOUIS--THOUGH THE OTHER ROOMS WERE CLOTHED IN THE RAG CARPETING OF THE COUNTRY
A MAN LIKE THAT ALWAYS EXPOSES HIS CARDS SOONER OR LATER
SUCH CONDUCT MIGHT BE RESPECTABLE ENOUGH IN A VILLAGE DEBATING SOCIETY BUT IT WAS TRIVIAL AMONG STATESMEN IT WAS OUT OF PLACE IN SO AUGUST AN ASSEMBLAGE AS THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES
THE HEROINE STRANGLES HER OWN MOTHER
HIS CRIME WAS DISCOVERED AND HIS FALL FOLLOWED INSTANTLY
WHEN YOU GOT UP IN THE MORNING IT WAS FOGGY
I WOULDN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
AND THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WOULD GO RIGHT AFTER THAT MAN
A SHOWILY DRESSED MAN OF THE STYLE KNOWN AS VULGAR GENTEEL HAD A SHARP EYE AND A READY TONGUE
HE WAS GLAD TO GET AWAY AND FIND A PLACE WHERE HE COULD DESPISE HIMSELF IN PRIVATE AND TRY TO GROW HIS CLIPPED PLUMES AGAIN
LORD I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU
WHENEVER ANY ALLUSION WAS MADE THAT MIGHT RECALL SELBY TO MIND SHE LOOKED AWFUL--AS IF SHE COULD KILL HIM
A NEWLY-ELECTED SENATOR IS A POWER I KNOW THAT YES INDEED HE IS.--WHY IT IS JUST HUMAN NATURE
THAT ONE AMUSES YOU
NEITHER THE HAWKINS CHILDREN NOR THE WORLD THAT KNEW THEM EVER SUPPOSED THAT ONE OF THE GIRLS WAS OF ALIEN BLOOD AND PARENTAGE
SOMETIMES SHE WENT OUT AND SKIRTED A HIGH BLUFF SAND-BAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM AND OCCASIONALLY FOLLOWED IT UP A LITTLE TOO FAR AND TOUCHED UPON THE SHOAL WATER AT ITS HEAD--AND THEN THE INTELLIGENT CRAFT REFUSED TO RUN HERSELF AGROUND BUT SMELT THE BAR AND STRAIGHTWAY THE FOAMY STREAK THAT STREAMED AWAY FROM HER BOWS VANISHED A GREAT FOAMLESS WAVE ROLLED FORWARD AND PASSED HER UNDER WAY AND IN THIS INSTANT SHE LEANED FAR OVER ON HER SIDE SHIED FROM THE BAR AND FLED SQUARE AWAY FROM THE DANGER LIKE A FRIGHTENED THING--AND THE PILOT WAS LUCKY IF HE MANAGED TO STRAIGHTEN HER UP BEFORE SHE DROVE HER NOSE INTO THE OPPOSITE BANK
HE SAID THAT IT WAS BUT TOO EVIDENT THAT THIS PERSON HAD APPROACHED HIM IN THE HOPE OF OBTAINING A BRIBE
AND HE DID NOT STOP THERE BUT WHITEWASHED IT
YES I KNOW THE BILL WELL WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME YOUR OPINION OF IT INDEED SINCE YOU SEEM TO ASK IT WITHOUT RESERVE I AM OBLIGED TO SAY THAT I DO NOT REGARD IT FAVORABLY
MY HAIR IS GETTING GRAY AND MANY NIGHTS I DON'T SLEEP AT ALL
THEY WERE EDUCATED AND REFINED
AND IT'S NO BAD COUNTRY NOW FOR CALMNESS AND SOLITUDE I CAN TELL YOU--THOUGH THERE'S NO MONEY IN THAT OF COURSE
PHILIP NEVER WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HEAR WHAT WOULD BECOME OF A MAN WHO SHOULD LAY HIS HAND ON A WOMAN WITH THE EXCEPTION NAMED
A SURGEON WAS CALLED AND IT WAS THOUGHT BEST TO DRIVE AT ONCE TO THE BOLTON'S THE SURGEON SUPPORTING PHILIP WHO DID NOT SPEAK THE WHOLE WAY
PHILIP WAS DEVOURED WITH ANXIETY
SLEEP
BUT THE SENATOR SAID
SHOW THEM--SHOW THEM TO ME UNDER HIS STRONG EXCITEMENT HIS VOICE HAD GATHERED POWER AND HIS LAST SENTENCES WERE SPOKEN WITH SCARCELY A PERCEPTIBLE HALT OR HINDRANCE
HER PARENTS HAVE DISAPPEARED
CHALLENGED PEREMPTORILY
ARRIVED AT THE FINEST DWELLING IN THE TOWN THEY ENTERED IT AND WERE AT HOME
POOR FELLOW
IS THAT SO EVERY WORD OF IT WELL IT DOES SEEM TO ALTER THE COMPLEXION OF THINGS A LITTLE
BUT HERE THE PARALLEL
THE CONDUCTOR WAS STILL THERE TAKING HIS TICKETS AND GROWLING SOMETHING ABOUT IMPOSITION
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE AS WELL AS FOR THE SAKE OF OTHERS YOU OUGHT TO GO INTO SOCIETY OFTENER
THEE DRESSES AS THEE WILL AND GOES WHERE THEE PLEASES TO ANY CHURCH THEE LIKES AND THEE HAS MUSIC
AND WHEN HE SAW THE PATHETIC SORROW IN THEIR FACES WHEN THEY ASKED FOR MORE AND THERE WAS NO MORE TO GIVE THEM HE HATED HIMSELF FOR HIS STUPIDITY AND PITIED THE FAMISHING YOUNG THINGS WITH ALL HIS HEART
THIS IS PERFECTLY ASTOUNDING
BUT HIS EFFORTS MET WITH NO SUCCESS--INDEED THEY ONLY ANNOYED HER AND UNPLEASANTLY INTERRUPTED HER MEDITATIONS
THREE MONTHS PASSED
I AM BEATEN--I SURRENDER
I AM YOUR WIFE
HE SHRANK HOWEVER FROM TELLING HIS WIFE WHAT HE HAD DONE ON THIS OCCASION FOR HE KNEW THAT IF ANY PERSON WAS MORE ODIOUS THAN SMALL TO HIS FAMILY IT WAS BIGLER
WHAT I LOOK TO IS QUALITY SIR
BUT THIS IS ONLY THE PROLOGUE TO THE TRAGEDY
DON'T BE OFFENDED AT A TRIFLE
IF I CAN ONLY KEEP THE LAND TILL I MAKE MONEY ENOUGH TO TRY AGAIN PHILIP TOOK FROM HIS POCKET A MAP OF THE ANTHRACITE COAL REGION AND POINTED OUT THE POSITION OF THE ILIUM MOUNTAIN WHICH HE HAD BEGUN TO TUNNEL
THAT RUTH WAS IN NO DANGER OF ANY SERIOUS IMPRESSION HE FELT PRETTY SURE FELT CERTAIN OF IT WHEN HE REFLECTED UPON HER SEVERE OCCUPATION WITH HER PROFESSION
SHE WAS AGED AND FEEBLE BUT THIS GREAT NECESSITY SEEMED TO GIVE HER NEW LIFE
WHEN AT LENGTH THEY WENT AWAY AND LOCKED THE DREADFUL ROOM BEHIND THEM AND CAME OUT INTO THE STREET WHERE PEOPLE WERE PASSING THEY FOR THE FIRST TIME REALIZED IN THE RELIEF THEY FELT WHAT A NERVOUS STRAIN THEY HAD BEEN UNDER
YOU MUST GO NOW THE LADY ENTIRELY DISCONCERTED BY SUCH RUDENESS AND FRIGHTENED MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR OPENED IT AND STEPPED OUT
HIS ENTHUSIASM WAS IRRESISTIBLE
HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF GOING TO EUROPE
THE OTHER MATTER THAT DISTURBED HIM WAS THE DIRE INFLATION THAT HAD BEGUN IN HIS STOMACH
BUT THERE WAS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE ATTENDANCE OF JOURNALISTS IN THE REPORTERS WAITING-ROOM CHATTING SMOKING AND KEEPING ON THE QUI VIVE FOR THE GENERAL IRRUPTION OF THE CONGRESSIONAL VOLCANO THAT MUST COME WHEN THE TIME WAS RIPE FOR IT
THESE FEW PARAGRAPHS ARE NEARLY AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THE LIFE OF CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER WHOSE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STORY START HERE WITH CHAPTER XII
AND WHEN THE GIRL SAW THEM AND ANSWERING TEARS CAME INTO HER OWN EYES WASHINGTON COULD HARDLY CONTAIN THE EXCESS OF HAPPINESS THAT POURED INTO THE CAVITIES OF HIS BREAST THAT WERE SO LATELY STORED TO THE ROOF WITH GRIEF
AND YET THAT INSTANT OF ARREST HAD PROBABLY SAVED THE GIRLS FOR AS PHILIP FELL THE ORCHESTRA STRUCK UP YANKEE DOODLE IN THE LIVELIEST MANNER
AND SHE LISTENED AS ONE WHO LISTENS TO ORACLES AND GOSPELS AND WHOSE GRATEFUL SOUL IS BEING REFRESHED WITH THE BREAD OF LIFE
HEMP TOBACCO CORN MUST COME HERE
THIS PREDOMINANCE OF THE IMAGINATION OVER THE JUDGMENT GAVE THAT APPEARANCE OF EXAGGERATION TO HIS CONVERSATION AND TO HIS COMMUNICATIONS WITH REGARD TO HIMSELF WHICH SOMETIMES CONVEYED THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS NOT SPEAKING THE TRUTH
HE TALKED FREELY WITH PHILIP ABOUT RUTH AN ALMIGHTY FINE GIRL HE SAID BUT WHAT THE DEUCE SHE WANTED TO STUDY MEDICINE FOR HE COULDN'T SEE
HE WAS AWARE THAT NOBLE WAS POOR AND HAD A FAMILY TO SUPPORT AND THAT HE BORE AN UNBLEMISHED REPUTATION AT HOME
YOU'LL SEE WASHINGTON YOU'LL SEE HOW IT WILL BE
THE SPEAKER--"THE RULES ARE SUSPENDED THE MOTION IS CARRIED--FIRST READING OF THE BILL BY ONE IMPULSE THE GALLERIES BROKE FORTH INTO STORMY APPLAUSE AND EVEN SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE WERE NOT WHOLLY ABLE TO RESTRAIN THEIR FEELINGS

TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I HAVE TRIED TO PERSUADE THEM NOT TO GO INTO THE THING
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL--THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN THAT EVER--IT'S A GREAT DAY IT'S A GREAT DAY
THE WOMAN MAKES THE HOME PHILIP AND RUTH OFTEN HAD THIS SORT OF DISCUSSION TO WHICH PHILIP WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO GIVE A PERSONAL TURN
IF HE COULD HAVE A LITTLE HELP HE WOULD WORK HIMSELF WITH PICK AND BARROW AND LIVE ON A CRUST
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK A HORSE AND WAGON WAS DESCRIED MAKING A SLOW APPROACH TO THE CAMP OVER THE PRAIRIE
DO YOU FIND IT HARD AND LONELY TO BE SO FAR FROM YOUR HOME AND FRIENDS MISS HAWKINS I DO FIND IT DEPRESSING SOMETIMES BUT THEN THERE IS SO MUCH ABOUT ME HERE THAT IS NOVEL AND INTERESTING THAT MY DAYS ARE MADE UP MORE OF SUNSHINE THAN SHADOW WASHINGTON IS NOT A DULL CITY IN THE SEASON SAID THE YOUNG LADY
HE DREW A VIVID PICTURE OF THE VILLAIN AT LAST OVERTAKEN BY THE VENGEANCE OF HEAVEN
THEY ARE A SPECULATING RACE SIR DISINCLINED TO WORK FOR WHITE FOLKS WITHOUT SECURITY PLANNING HOW TO LIVE BY ONLY WORKING FOR THEMSELVES
HE WAS WOUNDED
HUMP IT ON THE DOOR-STEP JERRY--THE BLACKEST NIGGRO IN THE STATE WASHINGTON BUT GOT A GOOD HEART--MIGHTY LIKELY BOY IS JERRY
CHAPTER XLVII
AND IF HE DON'T RUN THIS TO STONE'S LANDING HE'LL BE DAMNED
COME TO ME
IT WAS A HARD BLOW TO POOR SELLERS TO SEE THE WORK ON HIS DARLING ENTERPRISE STOP AND THE NOISE AND BUSTLE AND CONFUSION THAT HAD BEEN SUCH REFRESHMENT TO HIS SOUL SICKEN AND DIE OUT
A CANVAS-COVERED MODERN TRUNK MARKED G
THE RESULT OF SEVERAL CONFERENCES WITH WASHINGTON WAS THAT THE SENATOR PROPOSED THAT HE SHOULD GO TO WASHINGTON WITH HIM AND BECOME HIS PRIVATE SECRETARY AND THE SECRETARY OF HIS COMMITTEE
THE WEEKS DRIFTED BY;--HARRY BRIERLY FLIRTED DANCED ADDED LUSTRE TO THE BRILLIANT SENATORIAL RECEPTIONS AND DILIGENTLY BUZZED AND BUTTON-HOLED CONGRESSMEN IN THE INTEREST OF THE COLUMBUS RIVER SCHEME
NOW HERE IS A WORK THAT WE'VE SOLD A LOT OF
INDEED THE SOCIETY AND THE INFLUENCES THAT HAD FORMED HER CHARACTER HAD NOT BEEN OF A NATURE CALCULATED TO MAKE HER SO
THE SENATOR WAS NOT AN INHOSPITABLE MAN HE LIKED TO HAVE GUESTS IN HIS HOUSE AND HARRY'S GAY HUMOR AND RATTLING WAY ENTERTAINED HIM
THE LETTERS WERE NOT EVEN ANSWERED
LET KINGS AND EMPERORS KEEP THEIR TINSEL CROWNS I WANT THEM NOT
SELLERS WHO REPRESENTS THE HEIRS WILL BE LED TO SEE THE MATTER IN THIS LIGHT WHEN WASHINGTON HAWKINS READ THIS DESPATCH HE WENT TO THE COLONEL IN SOME ANXIETY
HE WATCHED FOR HER COMING TO HIS CHAMBER
I AM SURE YOU'LL LIKE IT

ANY ONE WHO LOOKED AT THE LINE ON THE MAP AS IT WAS LAID DOWN FROM DAY TO DAY WOULD HAVE BEEN UNCERTAIN WHICH WAY IT WAS GOING
YOU SEE HE SAYS TO PHILIP ONE MORNING AT THE HOTEL WHEN HE WAS THUS ENGAGED I WANT TO GET THE THEORY OF THIS THING SO THAT I CAN HAVE A CHECK ON THE ENGINEERS I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO BE AN ENGINEER YOURSELF QUERIED PHILIP

ALL THE WORLD IS FILLED WITH SUNSHINE PART 6
AND LAST NIGHT WHEN SHE KEP A SINKING AND SINKING AND TURNED AWAY HER HEAD AND DIDN'T KNOW HIM NO MO IT WAS FITTEN TO MAKE A BODY'S HEART BREAK TO SEE HIM CLIMB ONTO THE BED AND LAY HIS CHEEK AGIN HERN AND CALL HER SO PITIFUL AND SHE NOT ANSWER
YOU ARE NOT IGNORANT OF HIS FEELING TOWARDS YOU PERHAPS NOT BUT PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW YOU WHO HAVE SO MUCH ADMIRATION HOW SINCERE AND OVERMASTERING HIS LOVE IS FOR YOU PHILIP WOULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN SO PLAINLY IF HE HAD IN MIND ANYTHING EXCEPT TO DRAW FROM LAURA SOMETHING THAT WOULD END HARRY'S PASSION
SHE HAD NO REPROACHES SHE HAD ONLY TENDERNESS AND PITY
IF THIS PERSON NOBLE SAID MR DILWORTHY IN A LITTLE SPEECH AT A DINNER PARTY GIVEN HIM BY SOME OF HIS ADMIRERS MERELY DESIRED TO SACRIFICE ME.--I WOULD WILLINGLY OFFER UP MY POLITICAL LIFE ON THE ALTAR OF MY DEAR STATE'S WEAL I WOULD BE GLAD AND GRATEFUL TO DO IT

BUT IT'S WORTH TRYING
SOMETHING IN THE FACE OF MR HAWKINS ATTRACTED HER AND SHE CAME AND LOOKED UP AT HIM
THE ASSERTION THAT THE BILL WILL PASS WAS PREMATURE
AND MADE UP HIS MIND THAT A FINE VEIN OF COAL RAN THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN ABOUT A MILE FROM THE RAILROAD AND THAT THE PLACE TO RUN IN A TUNNEL WAS HALF WAY TOWARDS ITS SUMMIT
HEAVEN PROTECT ME FROM SUCH A CHARGE
THEN SEVEN MALE LOBBYISTS AT $3,000 EACH--$21,000
YOU MUST WRITE AND TELL YOUR FATHER ABOUT IT--DON'T FORGET THAT NOW
BUT I'M KEEPING QUIET
HE HAS CAPTURED NOBLE I CONSIDER THAT A SPLENDID PIECE OF DIPLOMACY--SPLENDID SIR BY AND BY CAME ANOTHER DISPATCH FROM NEW YORK
WELL I ONLY WANT YOU TO EXAMINE INTO MY BILL
CHAPTER XII
BUT HE HAD A DIM NOTION THAT THERE WAS MORE ABOUT HERSELF IN THE LETTER THAN ABOUT HIM
NOBODY DOES THAT'S FOR FORM
MR TROLLOP TURNED IMMEDIATELY BACK FROM THE THRESHOLD
AT LEAST THE PALACE LINGERED DURING THE MOMENT THAT HE WAS RUBBING HIS EYES AND GETTING HIS BEARINGS--AND THEN IT DISAPPEARED AND HE RECOGNIZED THAT THE COLONEL'S INSPIRING TALK HAD BEEN INFLUENCING HIS DREAMS
AND SOMETIMES HE APPEARS TO BE A LITTLE BIT VISIONARY TOO I THINK THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD FOR A BUSINESS MAN
YOU CAN TELL ME THAT MUCH CAN'T YOU YES I DON'T MIND SAYING THAT MUCH
IF WE DO HAVE WAR I HOPE IT WILL BE FOR THE PATRIOTS OF CUBA
IT MUST BE RIGHT
DURING THE SUMMER HE HAD MADE CONSIDERABLE PRACTICAL ADVANCE IN THE SCIENCE OF ENGINEERING
WASN'T IT OLD WHAT'S HIS NAME THAT SAID ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL IS USEFUL WHETHER RUTH WAS ANYTHING MORE THAN DIVERTED WITH HARRY'S COMPANY PHILIP COULD NOT DETERMINE
GOD WILL PROVIDE AMEN
THAT NIGHT SHE SAT IN HER ROOM TILL ALL WAS STILL AND THEN SHE STOLE INTO THE GARRET AND BEGAN A SEARCH
BUT NOT AS A NEW THING--ON THE CONTRARY AS A MATTER OF LIFE-LONG STANDING
THE BUSY GENTLEMEN IN THE REPORTERS GALLERY JOTTED A LINE IN THEIR NOTE-BOOKS RAN TO THE TELEGRAPHIC DESK IN A ROOM WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH THEIR OWN WRITING-PARLOR AND THEN HURRIED BACK TO THEIR PLACES IN THE GALLERY
THERE WAS THAT ABOUT HER REBUKE WHEN HE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT TAUGHT HIM THAT TO LET HER SLEEP WHEN SHE MIGHT BE MINISTERING TO HER FATHER'S NEEDS WAS TO ROB HER OF MOMENTS THAT WERE PRICELESS IN HER EYES
AT THE LITTLE STATION WHERE PHILIP WAITED FOR THE NEXT TRAIN HE MET A MAN--WHO TURNED OUT TO BE A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND TOLD HIM HIS ADVENTURE
YES IT WAS THREE
NOBODY CAN HELP LIKING THE CREATURE HE MEANS SO WELL--BUT I DO DREAD TO COME ACROSS HIM AGAIN
CHAPTER XLII
WHEN SHE STEPPED OUT OF THE VEHICLE HER HEART BEAT FAST AND HER EYES FLASHED WITH EXULTATION
THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION A FRIEND SAID TO ME THAT MY ELECTION EXPENSES MUST BE VERY LARGE SPECIALLY MY HOTEL BILLS AND OFFERED TO LEND ME SOME MONEY
HE WAS IN SUCH DEEP DISTRESS THAT HE ALLOWED HIS WIFE TO PERSUADE HIM TO LET THE PAPERS BE DRAWN
NUMEROUS CASES WERE CITED TO SUSTAIN THIS OPINION
HE SAID THAT HIS PEOPLE HAD REPOSED A TRUST IN HIM AND IT WAS NOT FOR HIM TO DESERT THEM
BUT AFTER HE'D SPENT MONEY AND WORKED HARD AND TRAVELED HARD AND HAD HEAPS OF NEGROES ALL CONTRACTED FOR AND EVERYTHING GOING ALONG JUST RIGHT HE COULDN'T GET THE LAWS PASSED AND DOWN THE WHOLE THING TUMBLED
THA HAIN'T NO NEWS BOUT THE JEDGE HIT AIN'T LIKELY CAIN'T TELL FOR SARTIN
ALSO PRINTING AND ADVERTISING
THE PROSPECT WAS GLOOMY
WE'VE GOT QUIET MEN AT WORK HE WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE HERE MOUSING AROUND TO GET PROPOSITIONS OUT OF ALL THE FARMERS IN THE WHOLE WEST AND NORTHWEST FOR THE HOG CROP AND OTHER AGENTS QUIETLY GETTING PROPOSITIONS AND TERMS OUT OF ALL THE MANUFACTORIES--AND DON'T YOU SEE IF WE CAN GET ALL THE HOGS AND ALL THE SLAUGHTER HOUSES INTO OUR HANDS ON THE DEAD QUIET--WHEW
SHE HAD BELIEVED IT HER DUTY TO SUBDUE HER GAIETY OF TEMPERAMENT AND LET NOTHING DIVERT HER FROM WHAT ARE CALLED SERIOUS PURSUITS
SELLERS KNEW THE PRESIDENT VERY WELL AND HAD ACCESS TO HIS PRESENCE WHEN OFFICIALS WERE KEPT COOLING THEIR HEELS IN THE WAITING-ROOM
BUT DON'T WE LIVE IN THE FUTURE MOST TOO MUCH BERIAH
ROUST OUT THE OLD MAN--TELL HIM THE AMARANTH'S COMING
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS MAN AGAIN UNTIL I WAS OVERWHELMED THE NEXT DAY BY LEARNING WHAT A SHAMEFUL USE HE HAD MADE OF THE CONFIDENCE I HAD REPOSED IN HIM AND THE MONEY I HAD ENTRUSTED TO HIS CARE
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS SERVICES WERE NO LONGER NEEDED
THEY HAVE MADE ANOTHER FAILURE OF IT
CAN'T YOU FIGHT AGAINST HIS GREAT PENSION BILL AND BRING HIM TO TERMS OH NEVER
YOU TAKE HIM TO A DEPARTMENT AND SAY HERE GIVE THIS PERSON SOMETHING TO PASS AWAY THE TIME AT--AND A SALARY"--AND THE THING IS DONE
A SECOND'S THOUGHT WOULD HAVE CONVINCED EVERY ONE THAT GETTING OUT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND THAT THE ONLY EFFECT OF A RUSH WOULD BE TO CRASH PEOPLE TO DEATH
HE DID NOT BOTHER HIMSELF MUCH ABOUT DETAILS OR PRACTICABILITIES OF LOCATION BUT RAN MERRILY ALONG SIGHTING FROM THE TOP OF ONE DIVIDE TO THE TOP OF ANOTHER AND STRIKING PLUMB EVERY TOWN SITE AND BIG PLANTATION WITHIN TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OF HIS ROUTE
THE ALABAMA BUSINESS YOU KNOW
THE UNIVERSITY UP THERE ON RISING GROUND SIGHTLY PLACE SEE THE RIVER FOR MILES
AND I'LL FIX THAT YOU KNOW
HER EYES FELL UPON ONLY A VAST BRILLIANT EMPTINESS--THERE WERE NOT FORTY PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE
I MADE NO MEMORANDUM OF THE TRANSACTION AND NEITHER DID MY FRIEND
TO BUILD A ROAD OR OPEN A MINE OR PLANT A SWAMP WITH CANE TO GROW PAPER-STOCK OR FOUND A HOSPITAL OR INVEST IN A PATENT SHAD-BONE SEPARATOR OR START A COLLEGE SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER CONTIGUOUS TO A LAND SPECULATION
AFTER TWO DAYS OF THIS STRUGGLE WITH THE GRASPING ENEMY IT WAS EVIDENT TO DR LONGSTREET THAT RUTH'S WILL WAS BEGINNING TO ISSUE ITS ORDERS TO HER BODY WITH SOME FORCE AND THAT STRENGTH WAS SLOWLY COMING BACK
IT WOULD HAVE ALL HAPPENED JUST SO IF WE HAD NEVER BEGUN TO DIG THAT HOLE
HE HAS HINTED TO OUR CHILDREN THAT HE WOULD RATHER THEY WOULDN'T COME ABOUT HIS YARD TO PLAY WITH HIS CHILDREN,--WHICH I CAN BEAR AND BEAR EASY ENOUGH FOR THEY'RE NOT A SORT WE WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH MUCH--BUT WHAT I CAN'T BEAR WITH ANY QUIETNESS AT ALL IS HIS TELLING FRANKY OUR BILL WAS RUNNING PRETTY HIGH THIS MORNING WHEN I SENT HIM FOR SOME MEAL--AND THAT WAS ALL HE SAID TOO--DIDN'T GIVE HIM THE MEAL--TURNED OFF AND WENT TO TALKING WITH THE HARGRAVE GIRLS ABOUT SOME STUFF THEY WANTED TO CHEAPEN NANCY THIS IS ASTOUNDING AND SO IT IS I WARRANT YOU
IT WAS HARDLY UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT TO SEE AT ANY MOMENT THE GABLES AND SQUARE WINDOWS OF AN ELIZABETHAN MANSION IN ONE OF THE WELL KEPT GROVES
THANK YOU--THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
TWILIGHT CAME AND PRESENTLY THE STARS BUT STILL THE FIGURE REMAINED
THE COLONEL'S MOTTO WAS MILLIONS FOR DEFENCE BUT NOT ONE CENT FOR TRIBUTE WHEN LAURA CAME TO HAWKEYE SHE MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN THE ANNOYANCES OF THE GOSSIPS OF MURPHEYSBURG AND HAVE OUT LIVED THE BITTERNESS THAT WAS GROWING IN HER HEART IF SHE HAD BEEN THROWN LESS UPON HERSELF OR IF THE SURROUNDINGS OF HER LIFE HAD BEEN MORE CONGENIAL AND HELPFUL
SHERIFF
WE WILL GO TO MISSOURI
HOW COULD YOU DO IT CLAY CLAY BEGGED FORGIVENESS AND PROMISED NOT TO BREAK FAITH AGAIN
WHOM HE HAD NOT SEEN SINCE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WHEN HE LEFT HIM TO GO TO THE HOUSE
HAS BEEN A DOCTOR A YEAR NOW AND HAS HAD TWO PATIENTS--NO THREE I THINK
IT WAS A GENEROUS MEASURE
WAS SHE FASCINATED WITH HARRY'S CARELESS BON HOMIE AND GAY ASSURANCE
EVERYBODY TALKED ABOUT THE NEW WONDER CANVASSED THE THEME OF HER PROPOSED DISCOURSE AND MARVELED HOW SHE WOULD HANDLE IT
FAMOUS STATESMEN CROSSED HIS PATH DAILY
THE MAN LEFT
THEN HE RETURNED HOME AND REPORTED PROGRESS LIKE A COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
HE HAD BEEN A GREAT READER ALL HIS LIFE AND A REMARKABLE MEMORY HAD STORED HIS MIND WITH ENCYCLOPAEDIC INFORMATION
WAS ONE OF THOSE ELEGANT COUNTRY RESIDENCES WHICH SO MUCH CHARM VISITORS TO THE SUBURBS OF PHILADELPHIA
IT CLOSED AS FOLLOWS WITH LAURA HAWKINS FAIR FASCINATING AND FATAL AND WITH THE DISSOLUTE COLONEL OF A LOST CAUSE WHO HAS REAPED THE HARVEST HE SOWED WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO
COLONEL POOR LAURA WILL NEVER GET ANY BENEFIT FROM OUR BILL
AYES AND NAYS IT WAS DECIDED TO VOTE UPON THE ADJOURNMENT BY AYES AND NAYS
MEANTIME HARRY BLOSSOMED OUT IN THE SOCIETY OF HAWKEYE AS HE DID IN ANY SOCIETY WHERE FORTUNE CAST HIM AND HE HAD THE SLIGHTEST OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND
ACTING WITH HIS USUAL PROMPTNESS PHILIP WITH THE CONSENT OF MR BOLTON BROKE GROUND THERE AT ONCE AND BEFORE SNOW CAME HAD SOME RUDE BUILDINGS UP AND WAS READY FOR ACTIVE OPERATIONS IN THE SPRING
MR BOLTON SAID HE HAD NO RIGHT TO PUT HIS FAMILY TO THAT RISK
BUT NOW THE DEAD HAD CARRIED THEIR SECRETS WITH THEM
AS FAR AS THE LONG HIGHWAY RECEDED OVER THE PLAIN OF HER LIFE IT WAS LINED WITH THE GILDED AND PILLARED SPLENDORS OF HER AMBITION ALL CRUMBLED TO RUIN AND IVY-GROWN
THEE CAN NEVER STAND THE SEVERE APPLICATION
HE GOT UP AND WALKED THE FLOOR FEVERISHLY DURING TWO HOURS
THE TWO MOST DISTINGUISHED CRIMINAL LAWYERS IN THE CITY HAD BEEN RETAINED FOR HER DEFENCE AND TO THAT THE RESOLUTE WOMAN DEVOTED HER DAYS WITH A COURAGE THAT ROSE AS SHE CONSULTED WITH HER COUNSEL AND UNDERSTOOD THE METHODS OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IN NEW YORK
AN UNDEFINED SENSE OF INJURY CREPT INTO HER HEART
YEARS PASS
MANY PEOPLE WOULD THINK THAT WHAT A BOOKSELLER--OR PERHAPS HIS CLERK--KNOWS ABOUT LITERATURE AS LITERATURE IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO ITS CHARACTER AS MERCHANDISE WOULD HARDLY BE OF MUCH ASSISTANCE TO A PERSON--THAT IS TO AN ADULT OF COURSE--IN THE SELECTION OF FOOD FOR THE MIND--EXCEPT OF COURSE WRAPPING PAPER OR TWINE OR WAFERS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT--BUT I NEVER FEEL THAT WAY
YOU CAN GO AS ONE I DON'T KNOW AN ENGINE FROM A COAL CART FIELD ENGINEER CIVIL ENGINEER
THE CHILDREN CLIMBED ALL OVER SELLERS FONDLED HIM PETTED HIM AND WERE LAVISHLY PETTED IN RETURN
TWENTY MILES AN HOUR
WHAT A TEAM THAT WILL BE IN POLITICS HERE
I THOUGHT IT WASN'T ANY SLOUCH THAT WAS RUNNING THAT MIDDLE BAR IN HOG-EYE BEND
AT LENGTH MR BUCKSTONE SAID
BUT THAT IS NOT A MATTER OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE THE GOVERNMENT CAN STAND IT
YOU MEN MUST ENJOY YOUR SCHEMES AND YOUR ACTIVITY AND LIBERTY TO GO ABOUT THE WORLD SHE SAID TO HARRY ONE DAY WHEN HE HAD BEEN TALKING OF NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON AND HIS INCESSANT ENGAGEMENTS
I BELIEVE MY FRIENDS LIKE TO COME HERE
THE TWO WERE INTIMATE AT THAT TIME,--THEY HAD BEEN CLASSMATES--AND SAW A GREAT DEAL OF EACH OTHER
I THINK HE WILL SAY STILL FINER THINGS WHEN I TELL HIM THE TRIUMPH THE SEQUEL TO IT HAS GAINED FOR US
DOES SHE THINK I HAVE TURNED IDIOT
DUSENHEIMER A SAWMILL FURTHER DOWN THE STREAM A BLACKSMITH-SHOP AND A STORE AND THREE OR FOUR UNPAINTED DWELLINGS OF THE SLAB VARIETY
PERHAPS I OUGHT TO CARE FOR CONGRESS AND THAT SORT OF THING DON'T BE A GOOSE PHILIP
BUT HE WOULDN'T HEAR OF HER PAYING HIS FARE--IT WOULD BE ONLY A PLEASURE TO HIM TO SERVE HER
BUT THE BILL HAD TO BE PAID AND HARRY TOOK IT TO PHILIP AND ASKED HIM IF HE THOUGHT HE HADN'T BETTER DRAW ON HIS UNCLE
I TELL YOU MISS LAURA WOULD FASCINATE AN APPROPRIATION RIGHT THROUGH THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN ONE SESSION IF SHE WAS IN WASHINGTON AS YOUR FRIEND COLONEL OF COURSE AS YOUR FRIEND WOULD YOU HAVE HER SIGN OUR PETITION ASKED THE COLONEL INNOCENTLY
HE PLUCKED THE SWEETEST BUD THAT GREW THERE AND HAVING ENJOYED ITS ODOR TRAMPLED IT IN THE MIRE BENEATH HIS FEET
AND WE HAVE MADE A COMPACT TOO
HE HAS PUT AWAY SO MANY FORTUNES FOR US THAT I'M AFRAID WE NEVER SHALL FIND THEM RUTH WAS INTERESTED IN IT NEVERTHELESS AND PERHAPS MAINLY BECAUSE PHILIP WAS TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE ENTERPRISE
THIS LOG HOUSE WAS THE COMPACTLY BUILT TOWN AND ALL CREATION WAS ITS SUBURBS
IT WOULD BE ALMOST HAPPINESS TO SPITE SOMEBODY AT SUCH A TIME CHAPTER XLIII
AND THAT IS WHERE THEY MAKE A MISTAKE
THINGS DO LOOK BRIGHT AFTER ALL BERIAH
THE SECRETARY IN A LOUD VOICE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO READ THE TITLE OF A BILL
ALICE WAS ONE OF THOSE PATRIOTIC WOMEN IN THE RURAL DISTRICTS WHO THINK MEN ARE STILL SELECTED FOR CONGRESS ON ACCOUNT OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE OFFICE
DON'T I KNOW IT
IN THIS INTERVAL OF SILENCE AN APPRECIATION OF THE SITUATION GRADUALLY STOLE OVER THE AUDIENCE AND AN EXPLOSION OF LAUGHTER FOLLOWED IN WHICH EVEN THE COURT AND THE BAR COULD HARDLY KEEP FROM JOINING
GIRLS KNOWLEDGE IS NOW NO MORE A FOUNTAIN SEALED
IN THE MORNING SHE APPEARED NOT TO HAVE SLEPT SAID SHE HAD A HEADACHE
I'M EXPECTING MY SALARY AND ALSO SOME DIVIDENDS FROM THE COMPANY AND IF THEY GET ALONG IN TIME I'LL GO ALONG WITH YOU LAURA--TAKE YOU UNDER MY WING--YOU MUSTN'T TRAVEL ALONE
IT IS A LONG STORY
THEY REALLY SAY SAID ONE YOUNG QUAKER SPRIG TO ANOTHER YOUTH OF HIS AGE THAT RUTH BOLTON IS REALLY GOING TO BE A SAW-BONES ATTENDS LECTURES CUTS UP BODIES AND ALL THAT
YOU CAN'T MAKE HIS SOUL TOO IMMORTAL BUT I WOULDN'T TOUCH HIM HIMSELF
I KNOW I CAN GO THROUGH THE WHOLE CLINICS DISSECTING ROOM AND ALL
HARRY HAD WITH HIM A MAP OF THAT NOBLE STREAM AND OF THE HARBOR WITH A PERFECT NET-WORK OF RAILROADS CENTERING IN IT PICTURES OF WHARVES CROWDED WITH STEAMBOATS AND OF HUGE GRAIN-ELEVATORS ON THE BANK ALL OF WHICH GREW OUT OF THE COMBINED IMAGINATIONS OF COL
THIS WAS IN EARNEST
BATH-ROOM COAL-FIRES RICH CARPETS BEAUTIFUL PICTURES ON THE WALLS
YOU CAN'T MAKE A LIFE OVER--SOCIETY WOULDN'T LET YOU IF YOU WOULD--AND MINE MUST BE LIVED AS IT IS
THE CROWD SWAYED AND PUSHED IN EAGER EXPECTANCY AS THE JURY WALKED IN AND STOOD UP IN SILENCE
THERE WAS NOT A FRIEND TO THE MEASURE IN THE HOUSE COMMITTEE WHEN I BEGAN AND NOT A FRIEND IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE EXCEPT OLD DIL HIMSELF BUT THEY WERE ALL FIXED FOR A MAJORITY REPORT WHEN I HAULED OFF MY FORCES
SHE HESITATED
I SHALL FEEL HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AS MUCH AS MY OWN BAD LUCK
THE COLONEL NOTICED THE ACTION AND HE ALMOST SAID NO BUT HE THOUGHT OF THE FOLLY OF ATTEMPTING CONCEALMENT
DIDN'T MISS HAWKINS REFUSE YOU HARRY BLUSHED AND STAMMERED AND LOOKED AT THE JUDGE
BUT SELLERS WAS EXCITED AND HAPPY
TAKING A STREET CAR HE RODE AWAY TO THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CITY THE NEWER PORTION FORMERLY THE DISTRICT OF SPRING GARDEN FOR IN THIS THE BOLTONS NOW LIVED IN A SMALL BRICK HOUSE BEFITTING THEIR ALTERED FORTUNES
AND THERE WITHIN SIR ARE THE GOLDEN MINES GREAT SOLOMON'S OPHIR B
AT SWANSEA CLAY PAID HIS STAGE FARE STOWED HIM AWAY IN THE VEHICLE AND SAW HIM OFF
HE MIGHT BETTER
I WILL GO AND WORK FOR MONEY AND COME BACK AND HAVE ANOTHER FIGHT WITH FATE
GEORGE FRANCIS TRAIN
TO LEARN TO BE USEFUL
THEY CAME INTO HIS CABIN PRESENTLY WHERE HE SAT WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES AND HIS CHIN IN HIS HANDS--THE PICTURE OF DISCOURAGEMENT AND THEIR SPOKESMAN SAID
WAS SHE NOT THE HEROINE OF THE HOUR
HE COULD NOT NAME THE BOAT HE WAS ON
THEY WERE FROM LOVERS
HAVE YOU EVER READ THIS MA'M
AND CLAY HE--OH THE PO MOTHERLESS THING--I CAIN'T TALK ABOUT IT--I CAIN'T BEAR TO TALK ABOUT IT CLAY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE DOOR
TRUE I NEVER OFFERED TO CORRUPT YOUR PRINCIPLES--NEVER HINTED SUCH A THING
CHAPTER II
AS PHILIP DID NOT DESIRE A ROOM AT THAT HOUR HE WAS INVITED TO WASH HIMSELF AT THE NASTY SINK A FEAT SOMEWHAT EASIER THAN DRYING HIS FACE FOR THE TOWEL THAT HUNG IN A ROLLER OVER THE SINK WAS EVIDENTLY AS MUCH A FIXTURE AS THE SINK ITSELF AND BELONGED LIKE THE SUSPENDED BRUSH AND COMB TO THE TRAVELING PUBLIC
IT WASN'T CLAY'S TELEGRAM THAT HURRIED ME UP SO AND GOT ME READY TO START WITH YOU
BUT IT WILL NOT BE LONG--THE TENNESSEE LAND HE STOPPED AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF A BLUSH
SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY THIS TIME WITH A GOOD MANY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS OF NEWSPAPER ROW
OREILLE AND LADY 118.  AN UNMISTAKABLE POTATO MOUTH 119.  THE THREE PATIENTS 120.  TAIL PIECE 121.  DELIBERATE PERSECUTION 122.  "IT IS ONLY ME 123.  "ALL CONGRESSMEN DO THAT 124.  A TRICK WORTH KNOWING 125.  COL
BUT IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME PART OF IT AND KEEP THE REST SO THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO REMIND YOU OF ME WHEN YOU WISHED TO LAUGH AT MY FOOLISHNESS OH BY NO MEANS NO
FINALLY SHE SAID NO OUR STAID STEADY-GOING HAWKEYE FRIENDS NOTIONS AND MINE DIFFER ABOUT SOME THINGS--THEY RESPECT ME NOW AND I RESPECT THEM--BETTER LEAVE IT SO--I WILL GO ALONE
YOU ARRIVE EITHER AT NIGHT RATHER TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING OR SEE ANYTHING UNTIL MORNING OR YOU ARRIVE SO EARLY IN THE MORNING THAT YOU CONSIDER IT BEST TO GO TO YOUR HOTEL AND SLEEP AN HOUR OR TWO WHILE THE SUN BOTHERS ALONG OVER THE ATLANTIC
CHAPTER IV
I'M NOT GOING TO THROW IT AWAY NOT THE WHOLE OF IT HARRY TOLD THE COLONEL THAT THEY MUST DRIVE THE THING THROUGH HE COULDN'T BE DALLYING ROUND WASHINGTON WHEN SPRING OPENED
EVERYBODY SEEKS SUDDEN FORTUNE AND WILL NOT LAY ONE UP BY SLOW TOIL
I WILL NOT BETRAY THE NAMES
CHAPTER VI
IF YOU BANDON ME YOU KNOWS WHAT TO SPECT THEN HE RUSHES OUTEN THE HOUSE I GOES IN--AND I SAYS MISSIS DID YOU RING SHE WAS A STANDIN LIKE A TIGER HER EYES FLASHIN I COME RIGHT OUT
WASHINGTON PLUNGED INTO THIS LOVE AFFAIR AS HE PLUNGED INTO EVERYTHING ELSE--UPON IMPULSE AND WITHOUT REFLECTION
I AM NOT LIKELY TO STINT YOU IN ANYTHING I FANCY
HE'S A MAN THAT KEEPS HIMSELF TO HIMSELF AND WELL HE MAY FOR HE KNOWS THAT HE'S GOT A REPUTATION THAT COVERS THE WHOLE EARTH--HE WON'T CONDESCEND TO OPEN HIMSELF OUT TO MANY PEOPLE BUT LORD BLESS YOU HE AND I ARE JUST LIKE BROTHERS
PERHAPS RUTH SAW THIS
WAS IT UNNATURAL THEREFORE THAT WHEN GEORGE SELBY DEPARTED LAURA SHOULD WATCH HIM FROM THE WINDOW WITH AN ALMOST JOYFUL HEART AS HE WENT DOWN THE SUNNY SQUARE
WELL WELL WELL--HOW DID YOU EVER HAVE THE NERVE TO APPROACH HIM OF ALL OTHERS WHY MY FRIEND WE NEVER THINK OF ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING WITHOUT HIS HELP
THIS BEAUTIFUL SCENE IS STILL KNOWN IN NEW YORK AS THE KISSING OF BRAHAM WHEN THE TUMULT OF CONGRATULATION HAD A LITTLE SPENT ITSELF AND ORDER WAS RESTORED JUDGE O'SHAUNNESSY SAID THAT IT NOW BECAME HIS DUTY TO PROVIDE FOR THE PROPER CUSTODY AND TREATMENT OF THE ACQUITTED
PERHAPS THE COLONEL DIVINED HIS THOUGHTS OR WAS OFFENDED AT HARRY'S TALK FOR HE REPLIED NO NONSENSE MR BRIERLY
SHE WAS CALLED THE HANDSOMEST WOMAN IN WASHINGTON--DASHING YOU KNOW AND SARCASTIC AND WITTY
THE NIGHT DREW ON THAT WAS TO END ALL SUSPENSE
I SHOULD THINK NOT
IT IS--IT IS-OVER
I DO NOT KNOW
AND WHEN IT STOPPED IT STOOD DEAD STILL AND THERE WAS AN OMINOUS SILENCE
AND THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS THOUGHT WAS
AND YOU THINK I WILL HAVE IT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DOES IT LEAK WHY--A--DO THE CLOTHES FALL OUT OF IT WHEN IT IS--WHEN IT IS STATIONARY CONFOUND IT WASHINGTON YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE FUN OF ME
IT WAS DISTINGUISHED BY FRANKNESS OF LANGUAGE AS WELL AS BY BREVITY
HE WAS NOT LONG IN FINDING OUT THAT ALICE LIKED TO HEAR ABOUT PHILIP AND HARRY LAUNCHED OUT INTO THE CAREER OF HIS FRIEND IN THE WEST WITH A PRODIGALITY OF INVENTION THAT WOULD HAVE ASTONISHED THE CHIEF ACTOR
THEY COULD NOT GIVE HIM A COSTLY EDUCATION
HE WONDERED WHY PROVIDENCE COULD NOT HAVE REVERSED THE USUAL PROCESS AND LET THE MAJORITY OF MEN BEGIN WITH WEALTH AND GRADUALLY SPEND IT AND DIE POOR WHEN THEY NO LONGER NEEDED IT
THEY HAD THE SAME MEANNESSES GENEROSITIES AND TASTES
HE WAS SIX FEET HIGH WITH BROAD SHOULDERS LONG LEGS AND A SWINGING GAIT
LAURA WILL BE ALMOST A MILLIONAIRE DO YOU THINK MR DILWORTHY THAT THE HAWKINSES WILL GET MUCH OF THE MONEY ASKED PHILIP INNOCENTLY REMEMBERING THE FATE OF THE COLUMBUS RIVER APPROPRIATION
THEY CLIMBED TO THE THIRD STORY AND PAUSED BEFORE A DOOR WHICH THEY UNLOCKED AND WHICH ADMITTED THEM INTO A LONG APARTMENT WITH A ROW OF WINDOWS ON ONE SIDE AND ONE AT THE END
THEY THOUGHT AND TALKED AND TALKED AND THOUGHT BY TURNS
DAT'S IT
I'VE KEPT STILL SI AS LONG AS EVER I COULD
THE RAILROAD OH I HAD FORGOTTEN THE RAILROAD DEAR BUT WHEN A BODY GETS BLUE A BODY FORGETS EVERYTHING
IN THE EVENING WHEN THEY WALKED ABOUT THEY FOUND PEOPLE SITTING ON THE DOOR-STEPS OF THEIR DWELLINGS IN A MANNER NOT USUAL IN A NORTHERN CITY
I NEVER WANT TO PASS THROUGH SUCH A TIME AGAIN
HARRY AND LAURA HAD ALSO BEEN INTERVIEWED AND THERE WAS A STATEMENT FROM PHILIP HIMSELF WHICH A REPORTER HAD KNOCKED HIM UP OUT OF BED AT MIDNIGHT TO GIVE THOUGH HOW HE FOUND HIM PHILIP NEVER COULD CONJECTURE
SHE WOULD SEE HIM WHATEVER EXCUSES HE MADE AND HOWEVER HE AVOIDED HER
HE WAS THE MOST GENEROUS FELLOW IN THE WORLD AND PICTURESQUE CONVERSATION WAS THE ONE THING IN WHICH HE NEVER WAS BANKRUPT
IT DID NOT STIR HOWEVER AND HE SOON FOUND THAT IT WAS ONLY A STUFFED SKIN
HIS TUNNEL HAD MANIFESTLY PIERCED BEYOND THE NATURAL POINT OF JUNCTION
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A GENUINE LETTER
HIS TERM EXPIRES NEXT YEAR AND I FEAR WE SHALL LOSE HIM HE SEEMED TO BE PACKING THE DAY I WAS THERE
RUTH WAS ABSORBED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE THOROUGHLY HAPPY
WHEN RUTH READ IT SHE DOUBTED IF THE FELLOW HAD NOT GONE OUT OF HIS SENSES
SELLERS ABOUT NAPOLEON YOU'VE ALWAYS TOLD ME SO ANSWERED LAURA WITH A LOOK INTENDED TO CONTRADICT HER WORDS
IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER PHILIP'S FAULT LET US OWN THAT HE WAS IN THIS POSITION
I WANT MONEY TOO
CALMLY AND WITHOUT MALICE OR EXCITEMENT HE REVIEWED THE TESTIMONY
BUT THE COLONEL WAS ONLY DISCONCERTED FOR A MOMENT--HE STRAIGHTWAY FOUND HIS VOICE AGAIN
THE LEGISLATURE WAS CALLED UPON TO SPEW THEM FORTH--A THING WHICH THE LEGISLATURE DECLINED TO DO
THAT SHE WAS NOT A PROFESSOR OF RELIGION AND YET WAS A CHRISTIAN IN THE TRUEST AND BEST SENSE OF THE WORD FOR HER WHOLE HEART WAS DEVOTED TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF A GREAT AND NOBLE ENTERPRISE--NONE OTHER THAN THE SACRIFICING OF HER LANDED ESTATES TO THE UPLIFTING OF THE DOWN-TRODDEN NEGRO AND THE TURNING OF HIS ERRING FEET INTO THE WAY OF LIGHT AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
AND HE ADDED IF YOU AND BIGLER WILL PROCURE THE INDICTMENT OF EACH OTHER YOU MAY HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF PUTTING EACH OTHER IN THE PENITENTIARY FOR THE FORGERY OF MY ACCEPTANCES BIGLER AND SMALL DID NOT QUARREL HOWEVER
AT FIRST SHE WAS PLEASED WITH THE IDEA BUT PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT IT
I WILL NOT GIVE IT UP
HAVING NO FACTITIOUS WEIGHT OF DIGNITY TO CARRY THE MONTAGUES STEADILY IMPROVED THEIR CONDITION FROM THE DAY THEY LANDED AND THEY WERE NEVER MORE VIGOROUS OR PROSPEROUS THAN AT THE DATE OF THIS NARRATIVE
AND THEY BELIEVED IT TO BE PEOPLED WITH THE MYSTERIOUS DWARFS AND GIANTS AND GOBLINS THAT FIGURED IN THE TALES THE NEGRO SLAVES WERE IN THE HABIT OF TELLING THEM NIGHTLY BY THE SHUDDERING LIGHT OF THE KITCHEN FIRE
DO YOU THINK A CONGRESS OF OURS COULD CONVICT THE DEVIL OF ANYTHING IF HE WERE A MEMBER MY DEAR BOY DON'T LET THESE DAMAGING DELAYS PREJUDICE YOU AGAINST CONGRESS
SHE LOVED
SQUIRE HAWKINS GOT HIS TITLE FROM BEING POSTMASTER OF OBEDSTOWN--NOT THAT THE TITLE PROPERLY BELONGED TO THE OFFICE BUT BECAUSE IN THOSE REGIONS THE CHIEF CITIZENS ALWAYS MUST HAVE TITLES OF SOME SORT AND SO THE USUAL COURTESY HAD BEEN EXTENDED TO HAWKINS
SELLERS WOULD NOT NOW BE DANCING ATTENDANCE UPON CONGRESS AND ENDEAVORING TO TEMPT THAT IMMACULATE BODY INTO ONE OF THOSE APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS MEMBERS WHICH THE MEMBERS FIND IT SO DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS
HARRY SAID PHILIP AFTER A PAUSE WHAT HAVE YOU GOT ON THOSE BIG BOOTS FOR
THE GENERAL RECEIVED WASHINGTON WITH A KINDLY BUT RESERVED POLITENESS
IF YOUR THEORY IS RIGHT LET US GO INTO RAPTURES FOR NOBODY CAN ASK A HEARTIER PERSECUTION THAN THESE EDITORIALS ARE FURNISHING I AM NOT SO SURE OF THAT MY DAUGHTER
THEY APPOINT A COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE AND THAT COMMITTEE HEARS EVIDENCE THREE WEEKS AND ALL THE WITNESSES ON ONE SIDE SWEAR THAT THE ACCUSED TOOK MONEY OR STOCK OR SOMETHING FOR HIS VOTE
INDEED IN THAT VERY HOUSE HAD SHE NOT HEARD WOMEN PROMINENT BEFORE THE COUNTRY AND BESIEGING CONGRESS UTTER SENTIMENTS THAT FULLY JUSTIFIED THE COURSE SHE WAS MARKING OUT FOR HERSELF
IT'S IN A COAL REGION
IT WAS A MOST UNREASONABLE FEELING
I DID NOT OPEN THE PACKAGES OR COUNT THE MONEY
THAT CONSUMMATE ARTIST IN PASSION ALLOWED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT THE FASCINATION WAS MAINLY ON HIS SIDE AND SO WORKED UPON HIS VANITY WHILE INFLAMING HIS ARDOR THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
IT IS REALLY WHAT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED IF THIS WERE A NOVEL
YOU HAVE HEARTS YOU HAVE FEELINGS YOU HAVE WARM HUMAN SYMPATHIES
DID RUTH CARE FOR ANYBODY AT FALLKILL
COME GIVE US A KISS
AND IF YOU BELIEVE ME THAT CHILD HAS WORKED AND KEP THE RUN OF THE MED'CIN AND THE TIMES OF GIVING IT AND SOT UP NIGHTS AND NUSSED HER AND TRIED TO KEEP UP HER SPERITS THE SAME AS A GROWN-UP PERSON
GOOD-BYE BOYS--WE'VE ALL GOT TO COME TO IT AT LAST ANYWAY THE BOREAS STOOD AWAY OUT OF DANGER AND THE RUINED STEAMER WENT DRIFTING DOWN THE STREAM AN ISLAND OF WREATHING AND CLIMBING FLAME THAT VOMITED CLOUDS OF SMOKE FROM TIME TO TIME AND GLARED MORE FIERCELY AND SENT ITS LUMINOUS TONGUES HIGHER AND HIGHER AFTER EACH EMISSION
AND TO THE TURNKEY WHO LET THEM OUT HE PATRONIZINGLY SAID YOU'VE GOT A BIG ESTABLISHMENT HERE A CREDIT TO THE CITY
THAT THE SAID DILWORTHY SENT FOR HIM TO COME TO HIS ROOM IN THE HOTEL AT NIGHT AND HE WENT
SHE LOOKED DOWN INTO HIS FACE WITH A PITIABLE TENDERNESS AND SAID IN A WEAK VOICE
OURS SO FAR AMOUNT TO--LET ME SEE--10
THE REPORTERS GALLERY WAS MERELY OCCUPIED BY ONE OR TWO WATCHFUL SENTINELS OF THE QUILL-DRIVING GUILD
LAURA SMILED AND SAID FORGETTING HER ACQUIRED CORRECTNESS OF SPEECH IT IS ONLY ME AH COME IN SIT DOWN AND THE SENATOR CLOSED THE BOOK AND LAID IT DOWN
SHE WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS WHEN SHE CAME HOME TO SPEND FIRST DAYS
BUT IF YOU HAD GIVEN IT TO ME I WOULD HAVE KEPT IT--AND NOT FORGOTTEN IT DO NOT TALK SO MR BUCKSTONE
WELL SI OH CON-FOUND THE CON-FOUNDED--CON-FOUND IT NANCY
WE SUPPOSED FROM THE EASE WITH WHICH LOST PERSONS ARE FOUND IN NOVELS THAT IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT
SENATOR DILWORTHY LIVED SUMPTUOUSLY AND WASHINGTON'S QUARTERS WERE CHARMING--GAS
YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE BUT SIR SAID THE LADY APPEALINGLY I THOUGHT CAN'T HELP WHAT YOU THOUGHT--YOU MUST GO INTO THE OTHER CAR THE TRAIN IS GOING VERY FAST LET ME STAND HERE TILL WE STOP THE LADY CAN HAVE MY SEAT CRIED PHILIP SPRINGING UP
I'VE GOT THE REFUSAL OF A MILE SQUARE HERE SAID THE COLONEL IN OUR NAMES FOR A YEAR WITH A QUARTER INTEREST RESERVED FOR THE FOUR OWNERS THEY LAID OUT THE TOWN LIBERALLY NOT LACKING ROOM LEAVING SPACE FOR THE RAILROAD TO COME IN AND FOR THE RIVER AS IT WAS TO BE WHEN IMPROVED
WASN'T IT ENOUGH TO HAVE OFFERED THE LADY HIS SEAT TO HAVE RESCUED HER FROM AN ACCIDENT PERHAPS FROM DEATH
HE HAD BEEN DILIGENT AND MADE HIMSELF TO A CERTAIN EXTENT NECESSARY TO THE WORK HE WAS ENGAGED ON
MARKING DASHING ERASING FIGURING AND TALKING TO HERSELF
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU DO SAYS HE YOU GO INTO THE LAW COL
ALICE LIKED SOCIETY WELL ENOUGH SHE THOUGHT BUT THERE WAS NOTHING EXCITING IN THAT OF FALLKILL NOR ANYTHING NOVEL IN THE ATTENTIONS OF THE WELL-BRED YOUNG GENTLEMEN ONE MET IN IT
IT'S OUR CLOCK NOW--AND IT'S GOT WHEELS INSIDE OF IT AND A THING THAT FLUTTERS EVERY TIME SHE STRIKES--DON'T IT FATHER
IT NEVER DOES
I HAVE A MUCH GREATER ADMIRATION FOR SENATOR BALLOON YES BALLOON IS A MAN OF PARTS THERE IS NO DENYING IT I THINK SO
THERE'S NOTHING DEFINITE SAID MR BOLTON
IT IS SAID THE NOSES HAVE BEEN COUNTED AND ENOUGH VOTES HAVE BEEN BOUGHT TO PASS IT FOR SOME TIME THE CORRESPONDENTS HAD BEEN POSTING THEIR SEVERAL JOURNALS UPON THE ALLEGED DISREPUTABLE NATURE OF THE BILL AND FURNISHING DAILY REPORTS OF THE WASHINGTON GOSSIP CONCERNING IT
THIS WORLD OF ENCHANTMENT TEEMED WITH SPECULATION--THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE WAS THICK WITH IT--AND THAT INDEED WAS WASHINGTON HAWKINS NATIVE AIR
SHE ALSO HAD A HISTORY POSSIBLY AND HAD SOMETIME BEATEN HER YOUNG WINGS AGAINST THE CAGE OF CUSTOM AND INDULGED IN DREAMS OF A NEW SOCIAL ORDER AND HAD PASSED THROUGH THAT FIERY PERIOD WHEN IT SEEMS POSSIBLE FOR ONE MIND WHICH HAS NOT YET TRIED ITS LIMITS TO BREAK UP AND RE-ARRANGE THE WORLD
HE TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT BY THE HOUR ABOUT HIS MAGNIFICENT STUD AND HIS PLANTATION AT HAWKEYE A KIND OF PRINCIPALITY--HE REPRESENTED IT
THE CHILDREN AND THE SLAVES WERE NOT MUCH MORE AT EASE AFTER FINDING OUT THAT THIS MONSTER WAS A CREATURE OF HUMAN CONTRIVANCE THAN THEY WERE THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN THEY THOUGHT IT THE LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH
IF THIS WEALTH HAD BEEN ACQUIRED BY CONSPICUOUS INGENUITY WITH JUST A PLEASANT LITTLE SPICE OF ILLEGALITY ABOUT IT ALL THE BETTER
BUT DON'T BE TROUBLED--IT WAS ALL MY FAULT
HAVING ONLY RICHES ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO GRATIFY REASONABLE DESIRES AND YET MAKE THEIR GRATIFICATIONS ALWAYS A NOVELTY AND A PLEASURE THE FAMILY OCCUPIED THAT JUST MEAN IN LIFE WHICH IS SO RARELY ATTAINED AND STILL MORE RARELY ENJOYED WITHOUT DISCONTENT
BUT I PUT UP A BASKET OF PROVISIONS,--WIFE WOULD PUT IN A FEW DELICACIES WOMEN ALWAYS WILL AND A HALF DOZEN OF THAT BURGUNDY I WAS TELLING YOU OF MR BRIEFLY
JUST GLANCE AT THE TITLE PLEASE,--'GONDERIL THE VAMPIRE OR THE DANCE OF DEATH AND HERE IS THE JOKIST'S OWN TREASURY OR THE PHUNNY PHELLOW'S BOSOM PHRIEND THE FUNNIEST THING!--I'VE READ IT FOUR TIMES MA'M AND I CAN LAUGH AT THE VERY SIGHT OF IT YET
BUT I AM A WOMAN AND SO I AM GRATIFIED FOR IT JUST AS IT IS AND WOULD NOT HAVE IT ALTERED BUT IT IS NOT MERELY A COMPLIMENT--THAT IS AN EMPTY COMPLEMENT--IT IS THE TRUTH
SHE TRIED TO HIDE IT BUT THE MORE SHE TRIED THE MORE MANIFEST IT BECAME AND WITHAL THE MORE CAPTIVATING TO LOOK UPON
THEN BY THE SPOON TO BLOODY RUN--THANK YOU THE INK
OURS HAVE AMOUNTED TO SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SOME CENTS UP TO THIS TIME GOOD HEAVENS OH YES
HE HAS NO RIGHT TO LIVE
BUT TELL ME FATHER CONTINUED RUTH NOT TO BE PUT OFF IS THEE STILL GOING ON WITH THAT BIGLER AND THOSE OTHER MEN WHO COME HERE AND ENTICE THEE MR BOLTON SMILED AS MEN DO WHEN THEY TALK WITH WOMEN ABOUT BUSINESS SUCH MEN HAVE THEIR USES RUTH
IF HE SHOULD CALL HER LAURA DARLING AND LOOK SO
IT WAS TRUE THAT THERE WERE NO OUTCROPPINGS OF COAL AT THE PLACE AND THE PEOPLE AT ILIUM SAID HE MOUGHT AS WELL DIG FOR PLUG TERBACCER THERE BUT PHILIP HAD GREAT FAITH IN THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE'S OPERATIONS IN AGES PAST AND HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT HE SHOULD STRIKE AT THIS SPOT THE RICH VEIN THAT HAD MADE THE FORTUNE OF THE GOLDEN BRIAR COMPANY
STOPPING HERE GENTLEMEN--STOPPING AT THE SOUTHERN IN SHAPING THEIR REPLY IN THEIR MINDS THE TITLE MR HAD A PLACE IN IT
OTHER AFTERNOONS LIKE IT FOLLOWED
HE HAD LOST HIS INTEREST IN SUCH THINGS
WERE NOT THESE FOLLOWING CHEERS THE EXPRESSION OF POPULAR APPROVAL AND AFFECTION
AND NOW WASHINGTON NOTICED AN INSTINCT IN HIMSELF THAT MOVED HIM TO KEEP NOT IN THE GENERAL'S REAR EXACTLY BUT YET NOT AT HIS SIDE--SOMEHOW THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S DIGNITY AND RESERVE DID NOT INSPIRE FAMILIARITY
I DON'T LIKE HIM ANY MORE THAN THEE DOES BUT I'D BETTER LEND HIM A LITTLE MONEY THAN TO HAVE HIS ILL WILL FATHER I THINK THEE'D BETTER HAVE HIS ILL-WILL THAN HIS COMPANY
IT'S SUCH A CRUSH AT THE YEARLY MEETING AT ARCH STREET AND THEN THERE'S THE ROW OF SLEEK-LOOKING YOUNG MEN WHO LINE THE CURBSTONE AND STARE AT US AS WE COME OUT
I HOPE THEE WILL HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH HIM HE HAS BEEN VERY UNFORTUNATE REPLIED MR BOLTON UNEASILY
THIS IS SILLY
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME IF THEE SHOULD LOSE THY PROPERTY AND DIE
IT WAS SIGNED BY ALL THE PEOPLE AT STONE'S LANDING WHO COULD WRITE THEIR NAMES BY COL
WAS THERE ANYTHING LEFT IN HER HEART BUT HATE AND BITTERNESS A SENSE OF AN INFAMOUS WRONG AT THE HANDS OF THE ONLY MAN SHE HAD EVER LOVED
VERY RESPECTABLE PEOPLE THE SELBY'S WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID HARRY IF IT'S BUSINESS
HE PICTURED HIMSELF AS SHE MUST BE PICTURING HIM
SHE RECEIVED THE HON
STRAIGHTWAY THE NEWSPAPERS SAID
THE GOOD OLD SPECULATOR WANTED TO COMFORT HIM BUT HE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT
HE DESIRED THAT A RIGID EXAMINATION BE MADE INTO SENATOR DILWORTHY'S CASE AND THAT IT BE CONTINUED CLEAR INTO THE APPROACHING EXTRA SESSION IF NEED BE
HE BUILT A GOVERNMENT SAW-MILL ON THE RESERVATION WITH THE MONEY AND THE LUMBER SOLD FOR ENORMOUS PRICES--A RELATIVE OF HIS DID ALL THE WORK FREE OF CHARGE--THAT IS TO SAY HE CHARGED NOTHING MORE THAN THE LUMBER WOULD BRING BUT THE POOR INJUNS--NOT THAT I CARE MUCH FOR INJUNS--WHAT DID HE DO FOR THEM GAVE THEM THE OUTSIDE SLABS TO FENCE IN THE RESERVATION WITH
NOW WHAT A WAY TO TALK THAT IS
THEN THERE WAS A LONG DELAY AT HAVRE DE GRACE
THE MEN WENT BACK TO THE TUNNEL AND PUT IN A PARTING BLAST FOR LUCK ANYHOW
FOR MR BLANK IS NEITHER A KNAVE NOR A FOOL
BUT ALL THE SWEET ODORS OF THE NIGHT COULD NOT TAKE FROM THE ROOM A FAINT SUGGESTION OF MORTALITY
AND JUST LOOK AT THAT RIVER--NOBLEST STREAM THAT MEANDERS OVER THE THIRSTY EARTH!--CALMEST GENTLEST ARTERY THAT REFRESHES HER WEARY BOSOM
BUT EVERYBODY FEELS FOR HIM
SHE WAS SOMEWHAT CONFUSED TO BE THE TARGET OF SO MANY EYES BUT HER HONEST AND GOOD FACE AT ONCE TOLD IN LAURA'S FAVOR
MRS BUCKNER HAS ALWAYS WANTED ME TO COME BUT THE MONEY CHILD WHY I THINK SHE WOULD SEND IT IF YOU WOULD WRITE HER--AND I KNOW SHE WOULD WAIT FOR HER PAY TILL COME LAURA LET'S HEAR FROM YOU MY GIRL EMILY AND LAURA WERE ABOUT THE SAME AGE--BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN
THE OLD GENTLEMAN UNDERSTOOD STONE'S LANDING A GOOD DEAL BETTER THAN HE WOULD HAVE DONE AFTER AN HOUR'S TALK WITH EITHER OF IT'S EXPECTANT PROPRIETORS
WHAT OCCURRED
THE MAN DID HONESTLY BELIEVE THERE WAS A FORTUNE IN THAT BLACK GUMMY OIL THAT STEWS OUT OF THE BANK SI SAYS IS COAL
HE FEARED HE HAD MISSED A TRICK AS HE EXPRESSED IT
ONE WILL DO ONE AT A TIME
ADOLPHE GRILLER WAS THE NAME LAURA READ ON THE CARD
LAURA STILL HAS A FATHER IN YOU AND IT IS BETTER FOR HER THAT WE DROP THIS SUBJECT HERE FOREVER THAT WAS ALL
HE SAW PEOPLE ALL AROUND HIM POOR YESTERDAY RICH TO-DAY WHO HAD COME INTO SUDDEN OPULENCE BY SOME MEANS WHICH THEY COULD NOT HAVE CLASSIFIED AMONG ANY OF THE REGULAR OCCUPATIONS OF LIFE
IS THY FATHER WILLING THEE SHOULD GO AWAY TO A SCHOOL OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS
HE IS A VERY PLEASANT MAN
THEN CAME THE SMILING FIELDS OF CHESTER WITH THEIR ENGLISH GREEN AND SOON THE COUNTY OF PHILADELPHIA ITSELF AND THE INCREASING SIGNS OF THE APPROACH TO A GREAT CITY
IF OTHER PLACES HAD BEEN DEFENDED AS WELL AS THAT WAS THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT SIR THE COLONEL HAD HIS OWN THEORIES ABOUT WAR AS HE HAD IN OTHER THINGS
PHILIP COULD REPORT TO MR BOLTON ONLY PROGRESS AND THIS WAS NOT A CHEERFUL MESSAGE FOR HIM TO SEND TO PHILADELPHIA IN REPLY TO INQUIRIES THAT HE THOUGHT BECAME MORE AND MORE ANXIOUS
I SUPPOSE OURS HAS DETERIORATED OF LATE MRS O.--"VERY MUCH INDEED
THEY DECLARED IN FACT--WOMEN ARE SUCH HYPOCRITES--THAT THEY QUITE ENJOYED THE CITY IT WAS IN AUGUST AFTER LIVING SO LONG IN THE COUNTRY THAT IT WAS A THOUSAND TIMES MORE CONVENIENT IN EVERY RESPECT
IT WAS CALLED A MANSION BECAUSE IT STOOD ALONE WITH AMPLE FIELDS ABOUT IT AND HAD AN AVENUE OF TREES LEADING TO IT FROM THE ROAD AND ON THE WEST COMMANDED A VIEW OF A PRETTY LITTLE LAKE WITH GENTLE SLOPES AND NODDING WERE NOW BLOSSOMING UNDER THE GENEROUS MODERN INFLUENCES
IF HE LOOKED SO SHE HATED HIM
MRS BOLTON SAID IT WAS A RELIEF FROM THE WORRY OF A LARGE ESTABLISHMENT AND RUTH REMINDED HER FATHER THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE HAD TO COME TO TOWN ANYWAY BEFORE LONG
SELLERS WELL"--HESITATED THE COLONEL--"I AM AFRAID SOME OF THEM DO BUY THEIR SEATS--YES I AM AFRAID THEY DO--BUT AS SENATOR DILWORTHY HIMSELF SAID TO ME IT IS SINFUL,--IT IS VERY WRONG--IT IS SHAMEFUL
WHAT IS IT FOREMAN
AH-TWO-TWENTY-TWO
AND SEE WHERE IT LEAVES HAWKEYE-CLEAR OUT IN THE COLD MY DEAR CLEAR OUT IN THE COLD
THE SECOND YEAR SALES WOULD REACH 200,000 BOTTLES--CLEAR PROFIT SAY $75,000--AND IN THE MEANTIME THE GREAT FACTORY WOULD BE BUILDING IN ST LOUIS TO COST SAY $100,000
IF THE JEDGE IS A GWYNE TO HOLD COTE I GOT TO ROUST EM OUT I RECKON
HARRY WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH RAGE WHILE THE SENATOR REMAINED IN TOWN
WHY IT MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT FIRE AND TOLD EVERYTHING
IN THIS SLUGGISH WATER SHE SEEMED TO GO LIKE A RACEHORSE
SNATCH HER THE WHEEL FLEW TO PORT SO FAST THAT THE SPOKES BLENDED INTO A SPIDER-WEB--THE SWING OF THE BOAT SUBSIDED--SHE STEADIED HERSELF SEVEN FEET SEV--SIX AND A HALF SIX FEET
AND WITH AN ACTIVITY AND A SUDDENNESS THAT BEWILDERED OBEDSTOWN AND ALMOST TOOK ITS BREATH AWAY THE HAWKINSES HURRIED THROUGH WITH THEIR ARRANGEMENTS IN FOUR SHORT MONTHS AND FLITTED OUT INTO THE GREAT MYSTERIOUS BLANK THAT LAY BEYOND THE KNOBS OF TENNESSEE
MY ONLY INTEREST IN IT IS A PUBLIC ONE AND IF THE COUNTRY WANTS THE INSTITUTION CONGRESS WILL HAVE TO YIELD IT MAY HAVE BEEN AFTER A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE COLONEL AND SENATOR DILWORTHY THAT THE FOLLOWING SPECIAL DESPATCH WAS SENT TO A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER
HE KNEW DOZENS OF GIRLS LIKE ALICE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF BUT ONLY ONE LIKE RUTH
BUT WOULD ONE BE IN EARNEST ABOUT SO FARCICAL A THING WELL IF IT WAS ONLY A JOKE WHY DID YOU MAKE A SERIOUS MATTER OF IT
IT ALWAYS IS
I DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO TURN--I NEVER HAVE BEEN DOWN SO LOW BEFORE I NEVER HAVE SEEN THINGS SO DISMAL
HAVE YOU BEEN AT THE CAPITOL TO-DAY MR HAWKINS WASHINGTON HAD NOT
HA-HA BOYS WE TOOK A COUPLE OF TRICKS THAT TIME SAID THE CAPTAIN
SENATOR DILWORTHY THOUGHT HE WOULD RUN OUT WEST AND SHAKE HANDS WITH HIS CONSTITUENTS AND LET THEM LOOK AT HIM
THEY WILL HANDLE A MILLION OR SO OF MONEY OFFICIALLY BUT WILL RECEIVE NO SALARIES
NOBODY READS HIS EDITORIALS BUT HIMSELF
WE UNDERSTAND THAT A PHILANTHROPIC PLAN IS ON FOOT IN RELATION TO THE COLORED RACE THAT WILL IF SUCCESSFUL REVOLUTIONIZE THE WHOLE CHARACTER OF SOUTHERN INDUSTRY
GO ON NOW AND PLAY--ALL OF YOU
IF MR BOLTON HAD SAID THE LITTLE WORD NO TO MR BIGLER ALICE MONTAGUE MIGHT NOW BE SPENDING THE WINTER IN PHILADELPHIA AND PHILIP ALSO WAITING TO RESUME HIS MINING OPERATIONS IN THE SPRING
I ATTENDED THEIR FUNERALS
HE HAD NEVER SUPPOSED THAT HE SHOULD BE THE ONE EMBARRASSED AND ABOVE ALL BY A SINCERE AND CORDIAL WELCOME
ALL DOORS WERE CLOSED AGAINST HIM ALL MEN AVOIDED HIM
AND IT WAS AGREED THAT RUTH IN ORDER TO SPARE HER FATIGUE SHOULD TAKE LODGINGS WITH FRIENDS NEAR THE COLLEGE AND MAKE A TRIAL IN THE PURSUIT OF THAT SCIENCE TO WHICH WE ALL OWE OUR LIVES AND SOMETIMES AS BY A MIRACLE OF ESCAPE
GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY IF I HAD TIME IF I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY IF I MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO GO ON AND TELL YOU THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MUTILATED STRANGERS THIS POOR GIRL HAS STARTED OUT OF COVER AND HUNTED FROM CITY TO CITY FROM STATE TO STATE FROM CONTINENT TO CONTINENT TILL SHE HAS RUN THEM DOWN AND FOUND THEY WAN'T THE ONES
SO YOU KNOW PHILIP STERLING SAID RUTH ONE DAY AS THE GIRLS SAT AT THEIR SEWING
IN THE MOST MATTER-OF-COURSE WAY THEY HAD BORNE THE BURDEN OF GETTING HIM READY FOR HIS TRIP NEVER SEEMING TO THINK OF HIS HELPING IN THE MATTER
HARRY WAS A VERY ENTERTAINING FELLOW HAVING HIS IMAGINATION TO HELP HIS MEMORY AND TELLING HIS STORIES AS IF HE BELIEVED THEM--AS PERHAPS HE DID
SEVERAL RAGGED NEGROES LEANED COMFORTABLY AGAINST THE POSTS OF THE AWNING AND CONTEMPLATED THE ARRIVAL OF THE WAYFARERS WITH LAZY CURIOSITY
HE MENTIONED MY YOUNG FRIEND AND SAID HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE THE $7000 NOW TO BEGIN HIS BANKING OPERATIONS WITH AND COULD WAIT A WHILE FOR THE REST
BETTER ALMOST TO HAVE DIED THAN TO SLOWLY GO MAD IN THIS CONFINEMENT
BY AND BY THERE WAS ONE WHICH CONTAINED A SINGLE LINE
YOU TALK LIKE A NEWSPAPER
THE SWELTERING CITY LAY AS IN A SWOON
CHALLENGED PEREMPTORILY AND SET ASIDE
WITH TWO SUCH NURSES AS RUTH AND ALICE ILLNESS SEEMED TO HIM RATHER A NICE HOLIDAY AND EVERY MOMENT OF HIS CONVALESCENCE HAD BEEN PRECIOUS AND ALL TOO FLEETING
QUESTION BY DISTRICT ATTORNEY
THEY THOUGHT AS THEY ALSO LOOKED AT MR BRAHAM HOW HANDSOME HE IS
NOT VERY LONG AFTER BREAKFAST THE TELEGRAMS BEGAN TO ARRIVE
SHE TOOK UP EACH LETTER IN ITS TURN TOUCHED A MATCH TO IT AND WATCHED IT SLOWLY CONSUME TO ASHES
IF I HAD MY CAPITAL FREE I COULD PLANT IT FOR MILLIONS I SUPPOSE YOUR CAPITAL IS LARGELY IN YOUR PLANTATION ASKED PHILIP
WHAT WAS IT FOR WHAT FOR
THINGS AIN'T SO DARK ARE THEY
CHAPTER XVI
SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES WERE PAID THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR TRAVELING EXPENSES BUT THEY ALWAYS TRAVELED DEADHEAD BOTH WAYS AND THEN DID AS ANY HONORABLE HIGH-MINDED MEN WOULD NATURALLY DO--DECLINED TO RECEIVE THE MILEAGE TENDERED THEM BY THE GOVERNMENT
IT SPEAK IT OUT--NEVER FEAR WELL IT--THEY SAY IT CONTEMPLATES A FRAUD UPON THE GOVERNMENT WELL SAID LAURA TRANQUILLY
YOU'D GO STRAIGHT TO THE COMMITTEE OR TO THE INTERIOR OFFICE I SUPPOSE
AND A SUNDAY HAD INTERVENED
THEY LIKE TO HAVE A PRETTY WOMAN STAYING WITH THEM NOT ONE SUPPOSE COL
DO YOU KNOW THIS SIGNATURE HERE?--AND THIS ONE
I LOOK FORWARD WITH LONGING TO THE TIME WHEN I CAN LAY ASIDE THE CARES OF OFFICE DAM SIGHT SHOUTED A TIPSY FELLOW NEAR THE DOOR
LET US BE PLAIN
COME NOW LET'S CHEER UP
AND THE POOR GIRL LOYAL TO RUTH LOYAL TO PHILIP WENT STRAIGHT TO HER ROOM LOCKED THE DOOR THREW HERSELF ON THE BED AND SOBBED AS IF HER HEART WOULD BREAK
SELLERS WOULD COME FOR ME I WOULD GO AND STAY WITH HIM A WHILE TILL THE TENNESSEE LAND IS SOLD
SEVENTEEN BRIDGES IN THREE MILES AND A HALF--FORTY-NINE BRIDGES FROM HARK-FROM-THE-TOMB TO STONE'S LANDING ALTOGETHER--FORTY NINE BRIDGES AND CULVERTS ENOUGH TO CULVERT CREATION ITSELF
WOULD THE JURY SAY THAT THIS RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE INFLICTED BY AN OUTRAGED AND DELUDED WOMAN RENDERED IRRATIONAL BY THE MOST CRUEL WRONGS WAS IN THE NATURE OF A FOUL PREMEDITATED MURDER
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THIS SEEMINGLY TRANSPARENT AND YET DEEP CHARACTER IN HER CHILDLIKE GAIETY AND ENJOYMENT OF THE SOCIETY ABOUT HER AND IN HER NOT SELDOM ABSORPTION IN HERSELF THAT WOULD HAVE MADE HER LONG REMEMBERED THERE IF NO EVENTS HAD SUBSEQUENTLY OCCURRED TO RECALL HER TO MIND
JURY WANT A LITTLE MORE TIME AND FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS WELL WELL WELL THIS IS TRYING SAID THE COLONEL
NOW YOU KNOW THAT WASHINGTON IT WAS A TERRIFIC THING--THERE IS NO DENYING THAT
THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO GET THAT SHE CALLED HIM BACK AND SAID
YOU MAY TELL CLAY THAT WHATEVER I GET HE CAN FREELY SHARE IN-FREELY
HER WEALTH ATTRACTED MANY SUITORS
IT WAS A NEGRO
THE WONDERFUL SPECULATION HINTED AT BY COL
GENERAL YOU'VE DONE A GREAT WORK SIR;--YOU'VE DONE A GREAT WORK FOR THE NIGGRO
GO ON
DO YOU GO TO SENATOR X
MR BUCKSTONE GOT THE FLOOR AGAIN AND MOVED THAT THE RULES BE SUSPENDED AND THE BILL READ A FIRST TIME
A NOTE WOULD BE MADE OF MR NOBLE'S ADMISSION
I WANT TO ASK YOU TO WORK FOR THE BILL AS WELL AS VOTE FOR IT IT TAKES SO MUCH OF ONE'S TIME MISS HAWKINS--AND TIME IS MONEY YOU KNOW YES I KNOW IT IS--ESPECIALLY IN CONGRESS
AND THERE'S YOUR TURNIP COUNTRY ALL AROUND DOODLEVILLE--BLESS MY LIFE WHAT FORTUNES ARE GOING TO BE MADE THERE WHEN THEY GET THAT CONTRIVANCE PERFECTED FOR EXTRACTING OLIVE OIL OUT OF TURNIPS--IF THERE'S ANY IN THEM
WE WILL FIND THE PLACE ITSELF
NOW THIS POOR GENTLEMAN'S MEMORY HAS ALWAYS BROKEN DOWN BEFORE HE REACHED THE EXPLOSION OF THE STEAMER
AND IN A LITTLE WHILE THE MALE POPULATION OF THE VILLAGE HAD ASSEMBLED TO HELP
WEAK AND LANGUID HE MADE SHIFT TO TURN HIMSELF ABOUT AND SEEK REST AND SLEEP
AND TO DO THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SEE THE MARVELOUS HISTORICAL PAINTINGS THAT HANG THERE AND THE BAS-RELIEFS--AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE THAT YOU SHOULD SUFFER THUS
TALKS BOUT GOIN TO MOZOURI--LOTS UV EMS TALKIN THAT--AWAY DOWN THAR OLE HIGGINS SAY
DO YOU THINK THAT COLOR MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE MR HAWKINS
SHE THOUGHT IT A PITY THAT THEY HAD TO BE SUCH CHANGED AND DREARY CREATURES ON OCCASIONS OF STATE
THE CAPITOL IS A VERY NOBLE AND A VERY BEAUTIFUL BUILDING BOTH WITHIN AND WITHOUT BUT YOU NEED NOT EXAMINE IT NOW
WHEN SHE ARRIVED SHE WAS POSSESSED OF HABITS OF ECONOMY AND NOT POSSESSED OF MONEY
FOR HIS TEACHERS WANTED HIM TO LEARN AND HE LOVED HIS TEACHERS DEARLY
WE HAVE FEW ENOUGH ANTIQUITIES AND IT IS LITTLE TO OUR CREDIT THAT WE MAKE SCARCELY ANY EFFORT TO PRESERVE THE FEW WE HAVE
AND NOW A NEW HORROR PRESENTED ITSELF
EVEN WASHINGTON OBSERVED ONCE THAT WHEN THE TENNESSEE LAND WAS SOLD HE WOULD HAVE A STORE CARPET IN HIS AND CLAY'S ROOM LIKE THE ONE IN THE PARLOR
THEN HE PUT HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS AGAIN AND ROCKED HIMSELF ABOUT AS ONE SUFFERING A GRIEF THAT IS TOO DEEP TO FIND HELP IN MOAN OR GROAN OR OUTCRY
SHE WAS AT ANY RATE AT THAT RIPE AGE WHEN BEAUTY IN WOMAN SEEMS MORE SOLID THAN IN THE BUDDING PERIOD OF GIRLHOOD AND SHE HAD COME TO UNDERSTAND HER POWERS PERFECTLY AND TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF THE SUSCEPTIBILITY AND ARCHNESS OF THE GIRL IT WAS PROFITABLE TO RETAIN
AND DID YOU WAKE ME SIR
AN HOUR AFTER SUPPER THE MOON CAME UP AND CLAY AND WASHINGTON ASCENDED TO THE HURRICANE DECK TO REVEL AGAIN IN THEIR NEW REALM OF ENCHANTMENT
HE COULD NOT SAY EXACTLY
PERHAPS SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW FATAL NOTORIETY USUALLY IS TO THE BLOOM OF WOMANHOOD
THE NEXT HER EYES FLASHED FIRE AS SHE HANDED THE DISPATCH TO HER MOTHER AND BITTERLY SAID THE WORLD IS AGAINST ME
WHEN THE SECOND BLIGHT FELL UPON HIM ANOTHER ANGEL APPEARED AND OFFERED $3,000 FOR THE LAND
SPENSER'S FAERIE QUEENS
ONE OF THESE NICK-NAMED THE ANTIQUES CONSISTED OF CULTIVATED HIGH-BRED OLD FAMILIES WHO LOOKED BACK WITH PRIDE UPON AN ANCESTRY THAT HAD BEEN ALWAYS GREAT IN THE NATION'S COUNCILS AND ITS WARS FROM THE BIRTH OF THE REPUBLIC DOWNWARD
DURING THE SUMMER PHILIP RODE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND MADE A SHORT VISIT IN HAWKEYE GIVING HARRY AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW HIM THE PROGRESS THAT HE AND THE COLONEL HAD MADE IN THEIR OPERATION AT STONE'S LANDING TO INTRODUCE HIM ALSO TO LAURA AND TO BORROW A LITTLE MONEY WHEN HE DEPARTED
HE SNATCHED THE COAT FROM HIS BACK GLANCED AT IT THREW IT FROM HIM AND FLEW BACK TO THE TUNNEL
WHEN HE FIRST LANDED IN NEW YORK WITH HIS WIFE HE HAD ONLY HALTED AT CASTLE GARDEN FOR A FEW MINUTES TO RECEIVE AND EXHIBIT PAPERS SHOWING THAT HE HAD RESIDED IN THIS COUNTRY TWO YEARS--AND THEN HE VOTED THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET AND WENT UP TOWN TO HUNT A HOUSE
DO YOUR VERY ABLEST TALKING NOW
TAKE IT--AND TAKE MY CURSE WITH IT TO BLISTER YOUR HEART A HUNDRED YEARS--AND MAY YOU LIVE SO LONG AND HE TORE A RING FROM HIS FINGER STRIPPING FLESH AND SKIN WITH IT THREW IT DOWN AND FELL DEAD
THAT TOWN'S AS BOUND TO DIE AS--WELL IF I OWNED IT I'D GET ITS OBITUARY READY NOW AND NOTIFY THE MOURNERS
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE NEWSPAPER MANAGERS DIDN'T WANT GENIUS BUT MERE PLODDING AND GRUBBING
BUT HENRY BRIERLY WAS GOOD COMPANY WHICH PHILIP WASN'T ALWAYS DID THEE KNOW THEE FATHER HAD BEEN IN CORRESPONDENCE WITH PHILIP RUTH LOOKED UP SURPRISED AND WITH A PLAIN QUESTION IN HER EYES
DID YOU SEE THOSE JAPS MISS LEAVITT OH YES AREN'T THEY QUEER
WITHOUT A DOUBT WE SHALL BE WORTH HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN A YEAR FROM THIS TIME--I PUT IT AT THE VERY LOWEST FIGURE BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS BEST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE--HALF A MILLION AT THE VERY LOWEST CALCULATION AND THEN YOUR FATHER WILL GIVE HIS CONSENT AND WE CAN MARRY AT LAST
YOU WILL HEAR FROM ME PHILIP DID HEAR FROM HARRY A FEW MONTHS AFTERWARD
MR BRAHAM WHISPERED TO O'KEEFE THAT'S THE MAN AVERY HICKS PEA-NUT PEDDLER
THE MAIN FIGHT CAME UPON THE FILLING OF THE BLANKS WITH THE SUM TO BE APPROPRIATED FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE LAND OF COURSE
HOWEVER IT WAS BEST IT WAS BEST--I'M SURE IT WAS BEST--AND SAFEST GIVE IT UP
THAT NIGHT OF AGONY WAS LIKE ANOTHER NIGHT SHE RECALLED
YOU ARE ALWAYS PROMPT WITH ME I ALWAYS MEET MY ENGAGEMENTS OF EVERY KIND MISS HAWKINS IT IS A QUALITY WHICH IS RARER IN THE WORLD THAN IT HAS BEEN I BELIEVE
WE HAVE SOME VERY GOOD SOCIETY INDEED AND ONE NEED NOT BE AT A LOSS FOR MEANS TO PASS THE TIME PLEASANTLY
WE CAN THEN SELL THE REST OF THE STOCK ON THE PROSPECT OF THE BUSINESS OF THE ROAD THROUGH AN IMPROVED COUNTRY AND ALSO SELL THE LANDS AT A BIG ADVANCE ON THE STRENGTH OF THE ROAD
TRYING TO MAKE OUR FORTUNE HERE HE BROUGHT US CLEAR DOWN TO THE GROUND NEARLY
THE MONEY MARKET DID NOT SEEM TO BE HALF SO TIGHT AS IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE
BUT THEE DIDN'T LISTEN TO HIM AGAIN WELL MOTHER HIS FAMILY IS IN WANT AND I LENT HIM MY NAME--BUT I TOOK AMPLE SECURITY
LEFFENWELL THE MEMBER FROM NEW ORLEANS HAD CASUALLY TOLD HIM AT THE HOUSE LAST NIGHT THAT SELBY AND HIS FAMILY WENT TO NEW YORK YESTERDAY MORNING AND WERE TO SAIL FOR EUROPE TO-DAY
WASHINGTON WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO GET AWAY AND FEEL FREE AGAIN
I SHALL SEE HIM TO-MORROW SHE SAID AND THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT
HUSBAND SAYS PERCY'LL DIE IF HE DON'T HAVE A CHANGE
HE WALKED IN A LEASH OF CONSPICUOUS CAPTIVES
ABOUT THE DETAILS OF HER STUDENT LIFE RUTH SAID VERY LITTLE TO HER FRIENDS BUT THEY HAD REASON TO KNOW AFTERWARDS THAT IT REQUIRED ALL HER NERVE AND THE ALMOST COMPLETE EXHAUSTION OF HER PHYSICAL STRENGTH TO CARRY HER THROUGH
THE COUNTRY IS GETTING ALONG VERY WELL HE SAID TO PHILIP BUT OUR PUBLIC MEN ARE TOO TIMID
THEN HE BLEW A TRUMPET-BLAST THAT STARTED THE MESHES OF HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND SAID IN ALMOST HIS BREEZY OLD-TIME WAY
THE BED HAD NOT BEEN DISTURBED
IF THERE WERE ANY DEEPENED LINES ABOUT THE EYES THEY HAD BEEN CONCEALED
I HEARD FROM RUTH YESTERDAY CAN I SEE HER LETTER NO INDEED
AND ONCE WHEN YOU ASKED THE CONDUCTOR AT WHAT HOUR YOU WOULD REACH WASHINGTON
I CAN BE READY SAID LAURA CHEERFULLY
SHE HAD NOT BEEN SO HAPPY FOR AGES AND AGES IT SEEMED TO HER
FROM THIS TIME FORTH THREE-HOUR WATCHES WERE INSTITUTED AND DAY AND NIGHT THE WATCHERS KEPT THEIR VIGILS
HE MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN
THAT SOLVES THE DIFFICULTY
WELL YOU SEE HIS INFLUENCE WAS NATURALLY RUNNING LOW WHEN HE LEFT HERE BUT NOW HE HAS GOT A NEW SIX-YEARS START AND HIS SUGGESTIONS WILL SIMPLY JUST WEIGH A COUPLE OF TONS A-PIECE DAY AFTER TOMORROW
THE COUNTRY HE SAW WAS WILD BUT NOT PICTURESQUE
WHAT PLAGUE WHAT PLAGUE INDEED
HE WANTS THAT PROPERTY TOO
WELL NEVER MIND--JUST KEEP IT TO YOURSELF
HE WOULD ARGUE HE WOULD PERSUADE HE WOULD APPEAL TO HIS HONOR
HE RETIRED UNDER THE TABLE WITH AN APOLOGETIC YELP WHICH DID NOT AFFECT THE ICEBERG
AFTER ALL HIS BRAIN WORK AND TONGUE WORK IN DRAWING PUBLIC ATTENTION TO HIS PET PROJECT AND ENLISTING INTEREST IN IT
TWO BIRDS IN HAND ARE WORTH ONE IN THE BUSH CERTAINLY
BUT HE WENT ON WE'LL STAND BY YOU
BUT SHE WAS NEVER MORE GAY AND THERE WAS A SPICE OF MISCHIEF IN HER EYE AND IN HER LAUGH
THE THUNDERBOLT FELL
NOW IT WAS WHISPERED THAT THE LEGITIMATE FORMS OF PROCEDURE USUAL IN THE HOUSE AND WHICH KEEP A BILL HANGING ALONG FOR DAYS AND EVEN WEEKS BEFORE IT IS FINALLY PASSED UPON WERE GOING TO BE OVERRULED IN THIS CASE AND SHORT WORK MADE OF THE MEASURE
NANCY I EXPECT I TURNED AS WHITE AS A SHEET
HAD SHE NOT A RIGHT TO HIM
FOR INSTANCE THAT SHE WAS OF A DISTINGUISHED WESTERN FAMILY
RISING TO HIS FEET
BUT I HAVE ESCAPED AND I WARRANT ME I'LL NOT PUT MY FOOT INTO HE STOPPED AND TURNED TOWARD THE STRANGER
UPON AGAIN COMING IN WORD WAS BROUGHT THAT THE JURY HAD NOT YET AGREED
THE NAME OF THE CITY IS BECOMING A REPROACH
BUT DON'T LOOK THAT WAY DEAR--DON'T MIND WHAT I SAY
YOU NEVER SUSPECTED HIM OF COURSE I OUGHT TO HAVE SUSPECTED HIM BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT EVER REALLY OCCURRED TO ME
SUCH DIFFERENCE AS EXISTED BETWEEN LAURA AND EMILY IS NOT UNCOMMON IN A FAMILY
FAREWELL THE OPENING OF THE ILIUM COAL MINE WAS BEGUN WITH ENERGY BUT WITHOUT MANY OMENS OF SUCCESS
WHAT WOMAN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD
THE SOCIETY AT THE BOLTON'S MIGHT HAVE BEEN A VALID EXCUSE FOR NEGLECTING BUSINESS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS
HE COULD LIFT HIMSELF BY ONE ARM AND DO THE GIANT SWING IN THE GYMNASIUM
TREAT YOU HOW ASKED LAURA IN A SWEET VOICE LIFTING HER EYEBROWS
I DON'T MEAN TO FRET I DON'T MEAN TO WORRY
NOW WE WILL GO AWAY FROM THIS HATEFUL CITY
THIS IS SOME KIND OF A TRUNK--AND AN ALMIGHTY RARE KIND TOO YES I BELIEVE IT IS WELL THEN WHY SHOULDN'T A MAN WANT TO STEAL IT IF HE GOT A CHANCE INDEED I DON'T KNOW.--WHY SHOULD HE WASHINGTON I NEVER HEARD ANYBODY TALK LIKE YOU
BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THIS FAIRNESS WAS BUT ILLY APPRECIATED SINCE GENTLEMEN WERE CAPABLE OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT FOR SELFISH AND UNWORTHY ENDS
THE TOWN SOON TEEMED WITH HISTORIES OF LAURA'S ORIGIN AND SECRET HISTORY NO TWO VERSIONS PRECISELY ALIKE BUT ALL ELABORATE EXHAUSTIVE MYSTERIOUS AND INTERESTING AND ALL AGREEING IN ONE VITAL PARTICULAR--TO-WIT THAT THERE WAS A SUSPICIOUS CLOUD ABOUT HER BIRTH NOT TO SAY A DISREPUTABLE ONE
SELLERS SAY SO
HE WAS NOT IDLE OR LAZY HE HAD ENERGY AND A DISPOSITION TO CARVE HIS OWN WAY
SHE WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE GONE DOWN UNDER THE WHEELS IF PHILIP WHO HAD SWIFTLY FOLLOWED HER HAD NOT CAUGHT HER ARM AND DRAWN HER UP
WASHINGTON DID NOT TAKE PART IN THE GAIETIES OF THE SEASON AS HE HAD DONE THE PREVIOUS WINTER
IN DUE TIME LAURA ALIGHTED AT THE BOOK STORE AND BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE TITLES OF THE HANDSOME ARRAY OF BOOKS ON THE COUNTER
REPRESENTING STATES AND TALKING OF NATIONAL AND EVEN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AS FAMILIARLY AS NEIGHBORS AT HOME TALK OF POOR CROPS AND THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF THEIR MINISTERS WAS LIKELY AT FIRST TO IMPOSE UPON PHILIP AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PEOPLE GATHERED HERE
BUT I HAVE NO ACQUAINTANCES THERE DON'T KNOW ANY OF THE FAMILIES OF THE CONGRESSMEN
HE RAN UP STAIRS AND WROTE GLOWINGLY ENTHUSIASTICALLY TO HIS MOTHER ABOUT THE HOGS AND THE CORN THE BANKS AND THE EYE-WATER--AND ADDED A FEW INCONSEQUENTIAL MILLIONS TO EACH PROJECT
THE MAIL WAS MONTHLY AND SOMETIMES AMOUNTED TO AS MUCH AS THREE OR FOUR LETTERS AT A SINGLE DELIVERY
THERE WILL OF COURSE BE A FEW EXPENSES BUT THE WIDOW AND ORPHANS WILL REALIZE ALL THAT MR HAWKINS DREAMED OF FOR THEM THE BIRDS WERE SINGING AS THEY CROSSED THE PRESIDENTIAL SQUARE NOW BRIGHT WITH ITS GREEN TURF AND TENDER FOLIAGE
THE LEGISLATURE WHOSE DUTY IT WOULD BE TO RE-ELECT HIM TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE WAS ALREADY IN SESSION
IT WAS NOT IN HER NATURE TO SHRINK
SHE WAS DRESSED IN SIMPLE BLACK WITH EXQUISITE TASTE AND WITHOUT AN ORNAMENT
SUPPOSE HE HAD SIMPLY SAID TO THE CONDUCTOR SIR YOUR CONDUCT IS BRUTAL I SHALL REPORT YOU THE PASSENGERS WHO SAW THE AFFAIR MIGHT HAVE JOINED IN A REPORT AGAINST THE CONDUCTOR AND HE MIGHT REALLY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING
NOTHING PRACTICAL IN EM THERE IS SOME TRUTH IN YOUR OBSERVATION COLONEL BUT YOU MUST EDUCATE THEM YOU EDUCATE THE NIGGRO AND YOU MAKE HIM MORE SPECULATING THAN HE WAS BEFORE
AND THEREFORE HE FINALLY LOST ALMOST ALL INTEREST AND HARDLY TROUBLED HIMSELF TO INSPECT RESULTS AT ALL
THE PILOT TURNED PRESENTLY TO GET HIS STERN-MARKS SAW THE LADS AND INVITED THEM IN
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A RAILROAD MAN OR A POLITICIAN OR A LAND SPECULATOR OR ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL FREE ON ALL RAIL-ROADS AND STEAMBOATS AND ARE CONTINUALLY CROSSING AND RECROSSING THE ATLANTIC DRIVEN DAY AND NIGHT ABOUT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT AND MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY BY SO DOING
AND THEY ALWAYS WIN TOO
SELLERS HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND THEY HAD DEPARTED UNDER THE UNSPOKEN FEAR THE VERDICT WOULD BE UNFAVORABLE A DISAGREEMENT WAS THE BEST THEY COULD HOPE FOR AND MONEY WAS NEEDED
WAIT
SELLERS ENLIGHTENING THE BOHEMIANS 126.  LAURA IN THE BOOK STORE 127.  VERY AGREEABLE CHAPTER XXVIII
BUT I WILL WRITE OUT HIS WONDERFUL ESCAPE IN FULL TO-MORROW OR NEXT DAY
IF THIS SEEMED TO MRS SCHOONMAKER A SINGULAR REMARK FOR A LADY TO MAKE WHO WAS MEETING REBELS IN SOCIETY EVERY DAY SHE DID NOT EXPRESS IT IN ANY WAY BUT ONLY SAID YOU KNOW WE DON'T SAY REBEL ANYMORE
CHECKED BY DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAD HE NOTICED ANY CHANGE IN LAURA AFTER HER ILLNESS
AND THE SADDEST PART OF IT WAS THAT THEY NEVER HAD HAD SO MUCH MONEY TO LOSE BEFORE FOR SELLERS'S SALE OF THEIR MULE CROP THAT YEAR IN NEW ORLEANS HAD BEEN A GREAT FINANCIAL SUCCESS
PERHAPS SOME DAY--HE FELT IT MUST BE SO SOME DAY--HE SHOULD STRIKE COAL
THAT HE WAS KNOWN TO BE A POLITICAL ENEMY OF MR DILWORTHY AND BITTERLY OPPOSED TO HIS RE-ELECTION
THE EIGHT YEARS IN AMERICA FROM 1860 TO 1868 UPROOTED INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE CENTURIES OLD CHANGED THE POLITICS OF A PEOPLE TRANSFORMED THE SOCIAL LIFE OF HALF THE COUNTRY AND WROUGHT SO PROFOUNDLY UPON THE ENTIRE NATIONAL CHARACTER THAT THE INFLUENCE CANNOT BE MEASURED SHORT OF TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS
A WEEK HAS PASSED
THEIR PERIODICAL KNOCKINGS STILL FINDING NO RESPONSE THEY BURST OPEN THE DOOR
S PER WASHINGTON HAWKINS P
AND ONCE FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS--BUT SOMETHING ALWAYS TOLD ME NOT TO DO IT
WITH THE CHECK CAME TWO THROUGH TICKETS--GOOD ON THE RAILROAD FROM HAWKEYE TO WASHINGTON VIA NEW YORK--AND THEY WERE DEAD-HEAD TICKETS TOO WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN TO SENATOR DILWORTHY BY THE RAILWAY COMPANIES
THE RAILROAD CONTRACTORS HELD OUT LARGE BUT RATHER INDEFINITE PROMISES
THE STATEMENT OF SENATOR DILWORTHY NATURALLY CARRIED CONVICTION TO THE MINDS OF THE COMMITTEE.--IT WAS CLOSE LOGICAL UNANSWERABLE
WHAT CAPACITIES OF VILENESS BITTERNESS AND EVIL
BLAME ME IF WE WOULDN'T HAVE RUN PLUMB BY IT IF TWILIGHT HAD HELD ON A LITTLE LONGER
WHEN I TELL THE OLD RESIDENTERS THAT THIS THING WENT THROUGH WITHOUT BUYING A VOTE OR MAKING A PROMISE THEY SAY THAT'S RATHER TOO THIN AND WHEN I SAY THIN OR NOT THIN IT'S A FACT ANYWAY THEY SAY COME NOW BUT DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT AND WHEN I SAY I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING ABOUT IT I KNOW IT THEY SMILE AND SAY WELL YOU ARE PRETTY INNOCENT OR PRETTY BLIND ONE OR THE OTHER--THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND THAT WHY THEY REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT VOTES HAVE BEEN BOUGHT--THEY DO INDEED
THEY SAID YES THEY WERE ABIDING AT THE SOUTHERN AND THOUGHT IT A VERY GOOD HOUSE
IT WILL MAKE LAURA RICH WITH THE REST OF US AND SHE HAS DONE NEARLY AS MUCH AS IF SHE WERE A MAN
AFTER ALL HIS HIGH HOPES AND SPLENDID PROPHECIES THE FATES HAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON HIM AT LAST AND ALL IN A MOMENT HIS AIR-CASTLES CRUMBLED TO RUINS ABOUT HIM
ALONG IN THE FALL THE INVITATION CAME SURE ENOUGH
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING WITH MONEY IN IT HE EXPLAINED TO MR BOLTON GOT HOLD OF IT BY GOOD LUCK
HE LOVED THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
HER HOUSE WAS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR IN WASHINGTON
THAT DILWORTHY HAD THE EFFRONTERY TO OFFER SUCH A RESOLUTION WILL SURPRISE NO ONE AND THAT THE SENATE COULD ENTERTAIN IT WITHOUT BLUSHING AND PASS IT WITHOUT SHAME WILL SURPRISE NO ONE
AH MY CHILD THE POOR NEGRO WILL BLESS OH BOTHER THE POOR NEGRO UNCLE
DAT MAN DO-NO WHAT HE'S BOUT
SHE KNEW SHE HAD BEEN WRONGED AND SHE KNEW THAT SHE HAD NO REMEDY
INDEED HE SCARCELY NOTICED ANYTHING OR KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
MR DILWORTHY OCCUPIED HIS SEAT TO THE LAST HOUR OF THE SESSION
A DOZEN SCHEMES WHICH HE HAD IN HAND ANY ONE OF WHICH MIGHT TURN UP A FORTUNE ALL LANGUISHED AND EACH NEEDED JUST A LITTLE MORE MONEY TO SAVE THAT WHICH HAD BEEN INVESTED
SELBY KNEELS AND KISSES HER HAND 134.  JOLLY GOOD COMPANY 135.  SUPPER OR BREAKFAST
LAY OFF YOUR OVERCOAT WASHINGTON AND DRAW UP TO THE STOVE AND MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME--JUST CONSIDER YOURSELF UNDER YOUR OWN SHINGLES MY BOY--I'LL HAVE A FIRE GOING IN A JIFFY
IF YOU ARE WILLING I WILL GO TO ST LOUIS
WASHINGTON HAD REFUSED AT THE LAST MOMENT TO TAKE $40,000 FOR THE TENNESSEE LAND AND HAD DEMANDED $150,000
IT WAS AN OBSTINATE JURY
THEY MUST A COST RIGHT SMART REFERRING TO THE BOOTS
AND EVERY LITTLE HELPS YOU KNOW SAID HARRY
WELL I MAY AS WELL ADJOURN
THE COLONEL TOLD THE MATRON AS HE WENT AWAY THAT IF SHE WOULD LOOK TO LAURA'S COMFORT A LITTLE IT SHOULDN'T BE THE WORSE FOR HER
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SO HOPELESS THAT NOW I CAN'T STAND GOOD NEWS AT ALL
SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS GREATLY SHOCKED OF COURSE BUT HE WAS FULL OF CHARITY FOR THE ERRING
I WISH IN ALL SINCERITY THAT I COULD BE WORTHY OF SUCH A FELICITOUS COMPLIMENT AS THAT
LAURA WAS GLAD THAT SHE HAD THE CHECK FOR NEW CLOTHING FOR SHE FELT VERY CERTAIN OF BEING ABLE TO GET THE COLONEL TO BORROW A LITTLE OF THE MONEY TO PAY HOTEL BILLS WITH HERE AND THERE
IT'S AWFUL HOT SAID WASHINGTON
A MEMBER OF CONGRESS
THE GOVERNMENT HAS FOUNDED AN INSTITUTION WHICH WILL REMOVE HALF THE DIFFICULTY FROM THE SOUTHERN PROBLEM
THE PERSONS WHO WERE IN THE PARLOR AGREE SUBSTANTIALLY AS TO WHAT OCCURRED
JUST SEE WHAT A COUNTRY IT GOES THROUGH
THERE AIN'T SUCH ANOTHER MISSIONARY FIELD OUTSIDE THE JUNGLES OF CENTRAL AFRICA
OF COURSE YOU MUST HAVE HAD
THEY LACKED SPIRIT
I FEEL THAT WHATEVER SERVICE YOU OFFER ME YOU OFFER WITH A GOOD HEART AND I AM AS GRATEFUL FOR IT AS IF IT WERE THE GREATEST BOON TO ME
HIS REMITTANCES HAD SUPPORTED THE HAWKINS FAMILY ENTIRELY FROM THE TIME OF HIS FATHER'S DEATH UNTIL LATTERLY WHEN LAURA BY HER EFFORTS IN WASHINGTON HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSIST IN THIS WORK
ALL THAT THEY COULD LEARN WAS THAT THE CHILD AND HER PARENTS CAME ON BOARD AT NEW ORLEANS WHERE THEY HAD JUST ARRIVED IN A VESSEL FROM CUBA
NOBODY HAD
OH YES INDEED I'VE OFTEN NOTICED THAT MA'M YES THEY JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS WITH AN ABSURD HEEDLESSNESS
OH IT IS PERFECTLY WONDERFUL
IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO SAY IT
IT IS ONLY WHEN WOMAN BECOMES DEMORALIZED THAT SHE TAKES TO ANY SORT OF GAMBLING
TO FIND IN SUCH AN OUT OF THE WAY COUNTRY PLACE A WOMAN LIKE LAURA WAS A PIECE OF GOOD LUCK UPON WHICH COL
OH HERE IS ONE FROM PHILIP
BUT AFTER ALL HE COULD NOT FEEL THAT GOOD HEALTH IN A FROZEN BODY WAS ANY REAL IMPROVEMENT ON THE RHEUMATISM
SHE IS SHREWD AND DEEP AND PLAYS HER CARDS WITH CONSIDERABLE DISCRETION--BUT SHE WILL LOSE FOR ALL THAT
JUST FILLED THEM UP WITH CHAMPAGNE AND THE FAT OF THE LAND PUT PEN INK AND PAPER BEFORE THEM WHILE THEY WERE RED-HOT AND BLESS YOUR SOUL WHEN YOU COME TO READ THEIR LETTERS YOU'D HAVE SUPPOSED THEY'D BEEN TO HEAVEN
AND I RECKON THERE IS BECAUSE CONGRESS HAS MADE AN APPROPRIATION OF MONEY TO TEST THE THING AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT JUST ON CONJECTURE OF COURSE
I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE FOR A BAGATELLE
EASTERN BORN MYSELF--VIRGINIA
NOW WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER WELL I DON'T SEE THAT WE DO
I CAN'T HELP LOVING THAT MAN FOR ALL HIS DROLLERY AND WAGGISHNESS
I SHALL GO
AH WELL-A-DAY
SHE THEN NARRATED THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF LAURA'S SUPPOSED MARRIAGE HER ABANDONMENT AND LONG ILLNESS IN A MANNER THAT TOUCHED ALL HEARTS
AND BESIDES I GOT INVOLVED IN SOME OPERATIONS THAT I HAD TO SEE THROUGH
WHAT DID THEY SAY AS THEY SAT THERE
WASHINGTON SLEPT IN A COLD BED IN A CARPETLESS ROOM AND WOKE UP IN A PALACE IN THE MORNING
DR GOLIGHTLY SUGGESTED THAT IN HIS OPINION DEATH ENSUED FROM A COMPLICATION OF THE TWO WOUNDS AND PERHAPS OTHER CAUSES
SIGHED NODDED SMILED--OCCASIONALLY PAUSED SHOOK HER HEAD
I TOLD HIM YOU WERE DAFT ABOUT THE NEGRO AND THE PHILANTHROPY PART OF IT AS YOU ARE DAFT IS A LITTLE STRONG LAURA
HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO WASTE NO MORE TIME IN WAITING ON PROVIDENCE BUT TO GO TO WORK AT SOMETHING IF IT WERE NOTHING BETTER THAN TEACHING IN THE FALLKILL SEMINARY OR DIGGING CLAMS ON HINGHAM BEACH
I SHOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT OF REFERRING TO SUCH A TRIFLING CIRCUMSTANCE NOW
IN THE END IT WAS DEMONSTRATED WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A DOUBT THAT THE GREAT FIND WAS NOTHING BUT A WORTHLESS SEAM
IT IS THIS UNCERTAINTY THAT CAUSES WOMEN CONSIDERED AS MATERIALS FOR FICTION TO BE SO INTERESTING TO THEMSELVES AND TO OTHERS
BY AND BY THERE IS NEWARK THREE OR FOUR NEWARKS APPARENTLY
S AT THE END OF A WEEK WASHINGTON WAS ABLE TO SEND THE HAPPY NEWS OFFICIALLY AS USUAL,--THAT THE NEEDED VOTE HAD BEEN ADDED AND THE BILL FAVORABLY REPORTED FROM THE COMMITTEE
HE STOOD ABOUT AMONG THE WORKMEN WITH THE BUSIEST AIR
SELBY WHEN THE PUBLIC KNEW AND WHEN IT DID NOT KNOW
MR GRAHAM SAID HE SHOULD MOVE AT ONCE FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS BUT THE JUDGE COULD NOT DO LESS THAN HIS DUTY THE LAW MUST HAVE ITS WAY
IT IS CONTENDED NOW THAT HE HAS BEEN A FRIEND TO THE BILL IN SECRET SINCE THE DAY IT WAS INTRODUCED AND HAS HAD BANKABLE REASONS FOR BEING SO
IT'S PERFECTLY UNHEARD OF PERHAPS SUGGESTED PHILIP IT WAS EFFECTED ON WHAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CALL THE ENDOWMENT OR THE PAID UP PLAN BY WHICH A POLICY IS SECURED AFTER A CERTAIN TIME WITHOUT FURTHER PAYMENT YOU THINK THEN SAID MR BOLTON SMILING THAT A LIBERAL AND SAGACIOUS POLITICIAN MIGHT OWN A LEGISLATURE AFTER A TIME AND NOT BE BOTHERED WITH KEEPING UP HIS PAYMENTS WHATEVER IT IS INTERRUPTED MR BIGLER IT'S DEVILISH INGENIOUS AND GOES AHEAD OF MY CALCULATIONS
CHIL'EN DAH'S SUM FIN A COMIN ALL CROWDED CLOSE TOGETHER AND EVERY HEART BEAT FASTER
INDEED HIS CREDIT WAS INJURED INSTEAD OF HELPED BY THE PRUDENT STEP HE HAD TAKEN
MUM'S THE WORD--DON'T WHISPER--KEEP YOURSELF TO YOURSELF
JUST STOP AND FANCY A MOMENT--JUST THINK A LITTLE--DON'T ANYTHING SUGGEST ITSELF
PHILIP HAS THE CONTROL OF IT AS EQUAL PARTNER IN THE VENTURE DEDUCTING THE CAPITAL INVESTED
CAN YOU READ YES BUT HAVEN'T A HABIT OF IT HAVE YOU HEARD OF THIS CASE I THINK SO--BUT IT MIGHT BE ANOTHER
IT WAS A PITY TO SEE SUCH A GAY BUTTERFLY BROKEN ON A WHEEL
DO YOU EXPECT TO WADE ASHORE I'M BREAKING EM IN THE FACT WAS HARRY HAD GOT HIMSELF UP IN WHAT HE THOUGHT A PROPER COSTUME FOR A NEW COUNTRY AND WAS IN APPEARANCE A SORT OF COMPROMISE BETWEEN A DANDY OF BROADWAY AND A BACKWOODSMAN
SOME INSTINCT TAUGHT WASHINGTON THAT HIS PRESENT LACK OF MONEY WOULD BE AN OBSTRUCTION THOUGH POSSIBLY NOT A BAR TO HIS HOPES AND STRAIGHTWAY HIS POVERTY BECAME A TORTURE TO HIM WHICH CAST ALL HIS FORMER SUFFERINGS UNDER THAT HELD INTO THE SHADE
WHOEVER THINKS HE IS DOING THE DUCHESS A KINDNESS BY INTIMATING THAT SHE IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ANY UNDERTAKING SHE PUTS HER HAND TO MAKES A MISTAKE
YOU MUST STOP TO BREAKFAST AND SEE THE EXCITEMENT THE SERVANT SOON CAME BACK WITH A WONDERING LOOK AND REPORTED MISS LAURA AIN'T DAH SAH
BUT IT DID NOT CONFUSE HIM AS MUCH AS IT APPARENTLY DID HER
MR BUCKSTONE'S CAMPAIGN WAS BRIEF--MUCH BRIEFER THAN HE SUPPOSED IT WOULD BE
ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK A LADY DELIBERATELY SHOT A MAN DEAD IN THE PUBLIC PARLOR OF THE SOUTHERN HOTEL COOLLY REMARKING AS SHE THREW DOWN HER REVOLVER AND PERMITTED HERSELF TO BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY HE BROUGHT IT ON HIMSELF OUR REPORTERS WERE IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY AND GATHERED THE FOLLOWING PARTICULARS
MY FRIEND MISS MEDLAR MR HAWKINS WHO WAS ENDEAVORING TO SQUARE HIMSELF FOR A BOW PUT HIS FOOT THROUGH THE TRAIN OF MRS SENATOR POPLIN WHO LOOKED ROUND WITH A SCOWL WHICH TURNED INTO A SMILE AS SHE SAW WHO IT WAS
HAD ANYTHING UNUSUAL HAPPENED JUST BEFORE THAT
HE TOOK IT WITH HIM FROM THE SOUTHERN HOTEL WHEN HE WENT TO WALK AND READ IT OVER AND AGAIN IN AN UNFREQUENTED STREET AS HE STUMBLED ALONG
CHAPTER XXXIII
FIRST AS I SAID THEY WILL TRY A LOT OF MEMBERS FOR TAKING MONEY FOR VOTES
TO LEARN TO BE GREAT AND GLORIOUS MEN AND WOMEN
AND BY GEORGE I'LL GO WITH YOU
IT WAS ONLY WHEN SHE WAS RECEIVED BY THE KIND PHYSICIAN AND READ PITY IN HIS EYES AND SAW HIS LOOK OF HOPELESS INCREDULITY WHEN SHE ATTEMPTED TO TELL HIM THAT SHE WAS NOT INSANE
I WILL GO ANY WHERE WITH YOU
NOR WAS IT HIS FAULT IF A GENERAL FLAVOR OF ROSE IN ALL THE DESSERT DISHES SUGGESTED THAT THEY HAD PASSED THROUGH THE BARBER'S SALOON ON THEIR WAY FROM THE KITCHEN
SHE DETESTED THE NARROW LIMITS IN WHICH HER LOT WAS CAST SHE HATED POVERTY
SELLERS FEEDING HIS FAMILY ON EXPECTATIONS 1.  CONTEMPLATION 2.  THE SQUIRE'S HOUSE S.  THE U
WHEN YOU WANT TO PLACE ANYTHING CONTINUED THE COLONEL CONFIDENTLY JUST LET BERIAH SELLERS KNOW
DILWORTHY LOOKS AT IT DIFFERENT OF COURSE
WELL I AM OBLIGED TO BELIEVE YOU WOULD BE RECKLESS ENOUGH TO DO THAT THEN DON'T PUT ME TO THE TEST MR TROLLOP
BEING NOW WEALTHY AND DISTINGUISHED MR O'RILEY STILL BEARING THE LEGISLATIVE HON ATTACHED TO HIS NAME FOR TITLES NEVER DIE IN AMERICA ALTHOUGH WE DO TAKE A REPUBLICAN PRIDE IN POKING FUN AT SUCH TRIFLES SAILED FOR EUROPE WITH HIS FAMILY
BUT THESE THINGS MUST NOT BE DWELT UPON
IF SENATOR DILWORTHY HAD NOT MADE THAT VISIT TO HAWKEYE THE HAWKINS FAMILY AND COL
I WENT OVER THE WHOLE THING
MR GRILLER CONTINUED TO PURR AS SOFTLY AS BEFORE
THE MAN WAS EVIDENTLY BLOODY MINDED
I KNOW YOU COULDN'T HAVE MEANT TO DO IT IT MUST HAVE BEEN INSANITY YOU KNOW OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
THERE WAS A KNOCK-THE POSTMAN HANDED IN A LETTER
I AM BROKEN BY THE WAR
HE UNDERSTANDS THE WANTS OF STONE'S LANDING AND THE CLAIMS OF THE INHABITANTS--WHO ARE TO BE THERE
I SHALL SEND YOU UP THAT BASKET OF CHAMPAGNE BY THE NEXT BOAT
HOW VIVIDLY IT ALL CAME BACK TO HER
UNTIL HE WAS NOW A MAN OF ABOUT THIRTY WITHOUT A PROFESSION OR A PERMANENT OCCUPATION A TALL BROWN-HAIRED DREAMY PERSON OF THE BEST INTENTIONS AND THE FRAILEST RESOLUTION
NO THANKS
BUT LAURA HAD GROWN TO BE ALMOST A WOMAN IN THESE FEW YEARS TO THE END OF WHICH WE HAVE NOW COME--YEARS WHICH HAD SEEN JUDGE HAWKINS PASS THROUGH SO MANY TRIALS
AND SO I RECKON IT'S BETTER FOR ME TO WAIT TILL I GET RICH AND THEN BY THAT TIME MAYBE I'LL KNOW WHAT I'LL WANT--BUT I DON'T NOW SIR CAREFUL OLD HEAD!--GOVERNOR HENRY CLAY HAWKINS!--THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL BE CLAY ONE OF THESE DAYS
SO SHE TOLD HIM SHE ACCEPTED HIS OFFER GLADLY GRATEFULLY
AND THEN THERE'S YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS AS A COMPANY TO CHICAGO FIRES AND BOSTON FIRES AND ORPHAN ASYLUMS AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING--HEAD THE LIST YOU SEE WITH THE COMPANY'S FULL NAME AND A THOUSAND DOLLARS SET OPPOSITE--GREAT CARD SIR--ONE OF THE FINEST ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE WORLD--THE PREACHERS MENTION IT IN THE PULPIT WHEN IT'S A RELIGIOUS CHARITY--ONE OF THE HAPPIEST ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE WORLD IS YOUR BENEVOLENT DONATION
PRAY EARNESTLY TO GOD TO PROSPER HIM IN HIS VOYAGE AND TO KEEP HIM FROM DANGER AND IF HE BE SUI JURIS HE SHOULD MAKE HIS LAST WILL AND WISELY ORDER ALL HIS AFFAIRS SINCE MANY THAT GO FAR ABROAD RETURN NOT HOME
MANY TIMES HE HAD BEEN IN LOVE EVEN FOR WEEKS AT A TIME WITH THE SAME OBJECT BUT HIS HEART HAD NEVER SUFFERED SO SUDDEN AND SO FIERCE AN ASSAULT AS THIS WITHIN HIS RECOLLECTION
WE PERCEIVE BY YOUR REPORTS AND THE REPORTS OF THE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING GRATIFYING PROGRESS WITH THE WORK.--WE ARE ALL VERY MUCH PLEASED INDEED
IS ADDED TO THEIR WAGES FOR--FOR FUN NO DOUBT
ALL WE WANT CONTINUED MR BIGLER IN HIS FRANK MANNER IS A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS TO START THE SURVEYS AND ARRANGE THINGS IN THE LEGISLATURE
HE GETS ANNOYED AND NEVER CAN SEE THE USE OF HAVING DIFFERENT NAMES FOR STATIONS IN JERSEY
THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN STAYED IN FALLKILL A WEEK AND WERE EVERY DAY AT THE MONTAGUES AND TOOK PART IN THE WINTER GAIETIES OF THE VILLAGE
THAT'S A POINT YOU WANT TO WATCH FOR THE RESULT OF THE WHOLE DAY'S WORK WAS THE SELECTION OF ONLY TWO JURORS
DURING THE WAR THERE CAME TO HAWKEYE A CONFEDERATE OFFICER COL
IT NEEDED ONLY THE PEACE OF THE MIND WITHIN TO MAKE IT A PARADISE
IT'S BRIM FULL OF IRON-ORE SIR--BRIM FULL OF IT
SHE TURNED HERSELF THIS WAY AND THAT--EVERYTHING WAS SATISFACTORY HER ATTIRE WAS PERFECT
A SLIGHT FRAIL GIRL LIKE THEE STUDY MEDICINE
THEY KEPT HIM INFORMED OF THE CONDITION OF THE CROPS SOUTH AND EAST AND THUS HE KNEW WHICH ARTICLES WERE LIKELY TO BE IN DEMAND AND WHICH ARTICLES WERE LIKELY TO BE UNSALABLE WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE SIMPLE FOLK ABOUT HIM
WHEN I GET THERE I PROPOSE TO MAKE THINGS HUM THE GREAT NEWS LIFTED SELLERS INTO THE CLOUDS
THE CHILDREN WERE PUT TO SCHOOL
HE CERTAINLY INTENDED TO BE AGREEABLE
YOU NEVER WAIT TILL THE FOREMOST DOLLAR OF IT ARRIVES WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES OF YOU AND SHE KISSED HER BROTHER GOOD BYE AND LEFT HIM WELTERING IN HIS DREAMS SO TO SPEAK
IT'S JUST WHAT RUTH USED TO SAY IF SHE WERE A MAN I WONDER IF ALL THE YOUNG LADIES ARE CONTEMPLATING A CHANGE OF SEX NO ONLY A CHANGED SEX RETORTED ALICE
HE LAY ALMOST MOTIONLESS FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEN SUDDENLY PARTLY RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM AS ONE WHO PEERS INTO A DIM UNCERTAIN LIGHT
EARTH HAS NO HIGHER NO GRANDER POSITION FOR ME
I'M OUT OF BUSINESS AND I'D JUST AS SOON HELP RUN THE THING AS NOT
I WILL NOT SURRENDER WHILE I AM ALIVE HE NEVER THOUGHT OF ASKING MR MONTAGUE FOR MORE MONEY
LET THE JURY DO WHAT THEY PLEASE
LAURA THOUGHT THE THING OVER
YEARS OF FLUCTUATING FORTUNE HAD DONE THEIR WORK
THE WORDS WERE ENCOURAGING
RUSS MOSELY HE TOTE OLE HANKS HE MOUGHT GIT TO OBEDS TOMORRER OR NEX DAY HE RECKONED WELL I WISHT I KNOWED
NANCY I'VE MADE UP MY MIND
TAKE ME AWAY I BEG OF YOU I IMPLORE YOU UPON THE PAVEMENT SHE WAS HUSTLED BY THE MOB THE SURGING MASSES ROARED HER NAME AND ACCOMPANIED IT WITH EVERY SPECIES OF INSULTING EPITHET
AND BY AND BY THE PEOPLE MADE HIM GOVERNOR--AND HE SAID IT WAS ALL OWING TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
BUT AIN'T IT A RIPPING ROAD THOUGH
PERHAPS I CAN SOMETIME WHAT IS YOUR REASON FOR SUPPOSING THAT THERE IS COAL THERE THE OPINION OF THE BEST GEOLOGIST I COULD CONSULT MY OWN OBSERVATION OF THE COUNTRY AND THE LITTLE VEINS OF IT WE FOUND
BUT EXPERIENCE SOBERS A MAN I NEVER TOUCH ANY THING NOW THAT HASN'T BEEN WEIGHED IN MY JUDGMENT
AND WHENEVER I CAN GIVE YOU ANY INFORMATION ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS AND PROSPECTS I SHALL BE GLAD TO DO IT HARRY'S LETTER WAS NOT A LONG ONE BUT IT CONTAINED AT LEAST THE CALAMITOUS FIGURES THAT CAME OUT IN THE ABOVE CONVERSATION
THEY HAD TACITLY SURRENDERED WHILE AS YET THE DAY OF BATTLE WAS NOT COME
HERE'S A BILL AFTER ALL
THIS THING DECIDES IT THOUGHT MR BUCKSTONE
HE WAS NEEDED NOW TO HELP THROUGH ANOTHER SCHEME A BENEVOLENT SCHEME IN WHICH COL
YOU WANT TO STIR YOUR STUMPS NOW HARRY--THE AMARANTH'S JUST TURNED THE POINT--AND SHE'S JUST A--HUMPING HERSELF TOO THE PILOT TOOK HOLD OF A ROPE THAT STRETCHED OUT FORWARD JERKED IT TWICE AND TWO MELLOW STROKES OF THE BIG BELL RESPONDED
AND NOW HE MUST CONTRADICT IT
SAID HE WOULD NOT NEED THE CAPITAL IN HIS NATIVE MAGNIFICENT WAY HE CALLED THAT EIGHTEEN DOLLARS CAPITAL TILL THE EYE-WATER WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT
AND IT'S THE BEST WAY--HIGH LIVING KILLS MORE THAN IT CURES IN THIS WORLD YOU CAN REST ASSURED OF THAT.--YES INDEED WASHINGTON I'VE GOT ONE LITTLE OPERATION ON HAND THAT--TAKE SOME MORE WATER--HELP YOURSELF WON'T YOU?--HELP YOURSELF THERE'S PLENTY OF IT.--YOU'LL FIND IT PRETTY GOOD I GUESS
BUT IT TOOK THE LAST PO STRENGTH SHE HAD AND SO HER EYELIDS BEGIN TO CLOSE DOWN AND HER ARMS SORT O DROOPED AWAY AND THEN WE SEE SHE WAS GONE PO CREETUR
IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME HE NOTED ITS SECOND READING AND BY AND BY THE DAY ARRIVED WHEN THE GRAND ORDEAL CAME AND IT WAS PUT UPON ITS FINAL PASSAGE
THAT'S YOUR NATIVE ELEMENT AND INTO THE LAW THE SUBSCRIBER IS GOING
INSTANTLY THE FIRE-DOORS OF THE BOREAS WERE THROWN OPEN AND THE MEN BEGAN DASHING BUCKETS OF WATER INTO THE FURNACES--FOR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TO STOP THE ENGINES WITH SUCH A HEAD OF STEAM ON
CHAPTER XV
SELLERS WAS NOT FAR AWAY
FIVE MINUTES LATER THE TWO FRIENDS WERE MOUNTED UPON THEIR LUGGAGE IN IT AND RATTLING OFF TOWARD THE STATION THE COLONEL ENDEAVORING TO SING HOMEWARD BOUND A SONG WHOSE WORDS HE KNEW BUT WHOSE TUNE AS HE RENDERED IT WAS A TRIAL TO AUDITORS
YOU MUST GO BACK TO HAWKEYE CAN'T-TAKE-ME LAURA ASKED WITH WONDER IN HER EYES
I'VE GOT MY INTERESTS IN MISSOURI
AND WHEN AT LAST SHE HAD SPREAD THE CLOTH AND LOADED IT WITH HOT CORN BREAD FRIED CHICKENS BACON BUTTERMILK COFFEE AND ALL MANNER OF COUNTRY LUXURIES COL
HE WAS A PARTNER WITH MR BOLTON NOW IN THE NEW COAL VENTURE CONCERNING WHICH THERE WAS MUCH TO BE ARRANGED IN PREPARATION FOR THE SPRING WORK AND PHILIP LINGERED WEEK AFTER WEEK IN THE HOSPITABLE HOUSE
DON'T YOU SPEAK OF IT SHE ADDED EARNESTLY GRASPING HIS ARM
IN THE DEEPENING WAYSIDE GREEN THE PINK FLUSH OF THE BLOSSOMING PEACH TREES THE SOFT SUFFUSION ON THE HEIGHTS OF ARLINGTON AND THE BREATH OF THE WARM SOUTH WIND WAS APPARENT THE ANNUAL MIRACLE OF THE RESURRECTION OF THE EARTH
I SET A VERY HIGH VALUE UPON IT NOW GIVE IT TO ME MR BUCKSTONE AND DO NOT SPEAK SO
WE WILL CALL IT THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE PARVENUS--AS INDEED THE GENERAL PUBLIC DID
I'M VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT MINE
I TELL MR OREILLE I CAN'T AND I WON'T PUT UP WITH ANY SUCH A CLIMATE
HE MIGHT BE LESS THAN FORTY FOR HIS FACE WAS WORN INTO HARD LINES AND HE WAS PALE
WASHINGTON WHO WAS NOT MINDING ANYTHING AS USUAL LOOKED ROUND IN WONDER
LET ME SEE--LET ME SEE
INTRODUCTIONS FOLLOWED AND THEN THE USUAL ORIGINAL QUESTION HOW DO YOU LIKE WASHINGTON MISS HAWKINS SUPPLEMENTED BY THAT OTHER USUAL ORIGINAL QUESTION IS THIS YOUR FIRST VISIT THESE TWO EXCITING TOPICS BEING EXHAUSTED CONVERSATION GENERALLY DRIFTED INTO CALMER CHANNELS ONLY TO BE INTERRUPTED AT FREQUENT INTERVALS BY NEW INTRODUCTIONS AND NEW INQUIRIES AS TO HOW LAURA LIKED THE CAPITAL AND WHETHER IT WAS HER FIRST VISIT OR NOT
I AM NOT DISTRESSED ABOUT THE NATIONAL IMPROVEMENT RELIEF MEASURE OH INDEED I AM NOT TRYING TO DISTRESS YOU
NO DOUBT YOU BELIEVE AS I CERTAINLY DO THAT IT IS THE THING TO DO
THEN A LOT OF SMALL-FRY COUNTRY MEMBERS WHO WON'T VOTE FOR ANYTHING WHATEVER WITHOUT PAY--SAY TWENTY AT $500 APIECE IS $10,000
ITS ONLY FURNITURE WAS A NARROW IRON BEDSTEAD WITH A TICK OF STRAW AND SOME BLANKETS NOT TOO CLEAN
SELLERS BLOWING BUBBLES FOR WASHINGTON 32.  GEN BOSWELL'S OFFICE 33.  TAIL PIECE 34.  CONSOLATION 35.  THE DYING FATHER 36.  TAIL PIECE CHAPTER I
GOOD MONEY
IF HE DREAMED AT ALL THAT NIGHT NO GOSSIPING SPIRIT DISTURBED HIS VISIONS TO WHISPER IN HIS EAR OF CERTAIN MATTERS JUST THEN IN BUD IN THE EAST MORE THAN A THOUSAND MILES AWAY THAT AFTER THE LAPSE OF A FEW YEARS WOULD DEVELOP INFLUENCES WHICH WOULD PROFOUNDLY AFFECT THE FATE AND FORTUNES OF THE HAWKINS FAMILY
A JURY OF INQUEST WAS IMPANELED AND AFTER DUE DELIBERATION AND INQUIRY THEY RETURNED THE INEVITABLE AMERICAN VERDICT WHICH HAS BEEN SO FAMILIAR TO OUR EARS ALL THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES--"NOBODY TO BLAME THE INCIDENTS OF THE EXPLOSION ARE NOT INVENTED
SHE NEITHER SOUGHT HIS COMPANY NOR AVOIDED IT AND THIS PERFECTLY LEVEL TREATMENT IRRITATED HIM MORE THAN ANY OTHER COULD HAVE DONE
WHY NANCY ENORMOUS DON'T EXPRESS IT--THE WORD'S TOO TAME
THE LEADERS ARE GROWING STUBBORN--THEY SWEAR THEY CAN CARRY IT BUT IT IS NOW ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE A MAJORITY AFTER A DAY OR TWO OF RELUCTANT AND AMBIGUOUS TELEGRAMS
WHEN COMPLETED IT WAS A FORMIDABLE DOCUMENT
THE PUBLIC MORALS MUST NOT BE CONTAMINATED
AND THEN COMES YOUR PRINTED DOCUMENTS--YOUR MAPS YOUR TINTED ENGRAVINGS YOUR PAMPHLETS YOUR ILLUMINATED SHOW CARDS YOUR ADVERTISEMENTS IN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PAPERS AT EVER SO MUCH A LINE--BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP THE PAPERS ALL RIGHT OR YOU ARE GONE UP YOU KNOW
SELBY WHO WAS STATIONED THERE FOR A TIME IN COMMAND OF THAT DISTRICT
I'VE BEEN WATCHING--I'VE BEEN WATCHING WHILE SOME PEOPLE SLEPT AND I KNOW WHAT'S COMING
HE MIGHT HAVE RESPECTED IN HIM ALSO A CERTAIN VULGAR SWAGGER AND INSOLENCE OF MONEY WHICH THE CLERK GREATLY ADMIRED
I WOULDN'T GIVE THAT TO BE GUARANTEED A HUNDRED THOUSAND COLD CASH IN A YEAR'S TIME WHERE'S MR BROWN HE IS IN THE SALOON PLAYING POKER WITH SCHAICK AND THAT LONG HAIRED PARTY WITH THE STRIPED TROUSERS WHO SCRAMBLED ABOARD WHEN THE STAGE PLANK WAS HALF HAULED IN AND THE BIG DELEGATE TO CONGRESS FROM OUT WEST THAT'S A FINE LOOKING FELLOW THAT DELEGATE WITH HIS GLOSSY BLACK WHISKERS
HE BEGGED FOR A GLASS OF MILK AFTER TRYING THAT GREEN HUED COMPOUND CALLED COFFEE AND MADE HIS BREAKFAST OUT OF THAT AND SOME HARD CRACKERS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN IMPORTED INTO ILIUM BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE IRON HORSE AND TO HAVE WITHSTOOD A TEN YEARS SIEGE OF REGULAR BOARDERS GREEKS AND OTHERS
IT DOESN'T NEED A CROWBAR TO BREAK YOUR WAY INTO SOCIETY THERE AS IT DOES IN PHILADELPHIA
BRIERLY DO YOU DARE TELL THE JURY THAT YOU HAD NOT AN INTEREST IN THE REMOVAL OF YOUR RIVAL COL
HE HAD TO BOLSTER UP HIS WIFE'S SPIRITS EVERY NOW AND THEN
I WAS ONLY JOKING
HIS NAME WILL GIVE TONE AND STRENGTH TO IT
HE SHAPED HIS COURSE STRAIGHT FOR HAWKEYE NOW AND HIS MEETING WITH HIS MOTHER AND THE REST OF THE HOUSEHOLD WAS JOYFUL--ALBEIT HE HAD BEEN AWAY SO LONG THAT HE SEEMED ALMOST A STRANGER IN HIS OWN HOME
WITH HER FOREHEAD RESTING UPON HER HAND SHE SAT THINKING THINKING WHILE THE UNHEEDED MOMENTS WINGED THEIR FLIGHT
HIS EFFORT IS STILL REMEMBERED AS THE GREATEST IN THE CRIMINAL ANNALS OF NEW YORK
I ALWAYS MAKE IT MY HOME THERE WHEN I RUN DOWN FROM HAWKEYE--MY PLANTATION IS IN HAWKEYE A LITTLE UP IN THE COUNTRY
SHE SELECTED SIX OR EIGHT LETTERS FROM THE PACKAGE AND BEGAN TO DEVOUR THEIR CONTENTS HEEDLESS OF THE COLD
IT'S CLEANED ME OUT WHEN I THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAD SURE THING
THESE LETTERS WERE THE LAST THING THAT HELD ME IN SYMPATHY WITH ANY REMNANT OR BELONGING OF THE OLD LIFE
IN WASHINGTON'S LETTER WERE SEVERAL IMPORTANT ENCLOSURES
WHEN A SENATOR WHOSE PLACE IS IN WASHINGTON MOVING AMONG THE GREAT AND GUIDING THE DESTINIES OF THE NATION CONDESCENDS TO MINGLE AMONG THE PEOPLE AND ACCEPT THE HOSPITALITIES OF SUCH A PLACE AS HAWKEYE THE HONOR IS NOT CONSIDERED A LIGHT ONE
THERE WAS NO DODGING THIS THING WITH THE LAME EXCUSE OF WANT OF TIME
I HAVE MADE YOU A PROPOSITION YOU HAVE NOT ACCEPTED IT AND I DESIRE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER THAT I HAVE MADE NONE
AND INDEED--THIS RELUCTANCE WAS JUSTIFIABLE WHEN ONE CONSIDERS HOW CONSTANTLY AND HOW GREATLY THE PROPERTY IS RISING IN VALUE
THE UNIVERSITY BILL WAS SURE TO PASS THIS TIME AND THAT WOULD MAKE MONEY PLENTY BUT MIGHT NOT THE HELP COME TOO LATE
AND AT ABOUT THE TIME SET THE TWO TRAVELERS ARRIVED SAFE IN THE CAPITAL OF THE NATION SURE ENOUGH
HE DILIGENTLY CONTINUED HIS EFFORT TO WIN HER BUT HE PRESENTLY FOUND THAT WHILE AS YET HE COULD NOT FEEL ENTIRELY CERTAIN OF HAVING WON HER IT WAS VERY MANIFEST THAT SHE HAD WON HIM
HE HAD NOT NEEDED THE DREADFUL FRUIT AND HAD NOT WANTED IT
PRESENTLY IN A HESITATING UNDECIDED WAY HE SAID
PHILIP WROTE TO RUTH RATHER A COMICAL ACCOUNT OF THE BURSTING UP OF THE CITY OF NAPOLEON AND THE NAVIGATION IMPROVEMENT SCHEME OF HARRY'S FLIGHT AND THE COLONEL'S DISCOMFITURE
I AM GOING TO MISSOURI
BUT THE SERIOUS ILLNESS OF ONE OF THE ENGINEERS KEPT PHILIP AND HENRY IN THE CITY AND OCCUPIED IN ALTERNATE WATCHINGS
BLESS YOU I SAW IN A MOMENT WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH US AND SAYS I OUT GOES YOUR FIRES!--NO MORE SLOW TORTURE AND CERTAIN DEATH FOR ME SIR
BUT ANYWAY THE LONGER IT'S DELAYED THE NEARER IT GROWS TO THE TIME WHEN IT WILL START--SAME AS EVERY DAY YOU LIVE BRINGS YOU NEARER TO--NEARER THE GRAVE WELL NO--NOT THAT EXACTLY
HE HAS GREAT CONFIDENCE IN HIS SUCCESS AND I HOPE FOR HIS SAKE HE WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED PHILIP COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT HE WAS TREATED VERY MUCH LIKE ONE OF THE BOLTON-FAMILY--BY ALL EXCEPT RUTH
THE COMPLETENESS OF HIS APPOINTMENTS WAS THE ENVY OF THE CORPS AND THE GAY FELLOW HIMSELF WAS THE ADMIRATION OF THE CAMP SERVANTS AXEMEN TEAMSTERS AND COOKS
SHE FOLLOWED WITH MORE INTEREST PHILIP'S SPARKLING ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE IN THE WEST AND LONGED FOR HIS EXPERIENCES AND TO KNOW SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE OF A WORLD SO DIFFERENT FROM HERE WHO ALTERNATELY AMUSED AND DISPLEASED HIM
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THIS CASE NOT TILL THIS MORNING SIR CAN YOU READ NOT FINE PRINT Y'R HONOR THE MAN WAS ABOUT TO BE SWORN WHEN MR BRAHAM ASKED COULD YOUR FATHER READ THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS MIGHTY HANDY AT THAT SIR MR BRAHAM SUBMITTED THAT THE MAN WAS DISQUALIFIED
WOULD THE CONDUCTOR OPEN THE DOOR AND ASK FOR PHILIP STERLING AND HAND HIM A FATAL DISPATCH
BUT HE LOOKS AS HELPLESS AS A RAG BABY
THE GREAT SECRET WAS NEW TO SOME OF THE YOUNGER CHILDREN BUT THEIR LOVE SUFFERED NO CHANGE UNDER THE WONDERFUL REVELATION
I WILL THINK OF IT AND LET YOU KNOW SOON
WHAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED WHEN THE TUMULT IN THE COURT ROOM HAD SUBSIDED THE SAGACIOUS READER WILL NOW LEARN
GENTLEMEN SEEMED EXCEEDINGLY ANXIOUS TO PRESERVE AND MAINTAIN THE HONOR AND DIGNITY OF THE SENATE
NEXT IS THE BLOODY RUN AND HAIL COLUMBIA COUNTRY--TOBACCO ENOUGH CAN BE RAISED THERE TO SUPPORT TWO SUCH RAILROADS
FOR RUTH WAS AS SERENELY UNCONSCIOUS OF MISCHIEF AS WOMEN CAN BE AT TIMES AND FASCINATED HIM MORE THAN EVER WITH HER LITTLE DEMURENESSES AND HALF-CONFIDENCES
YEARS--AGO--I--CAN'T SEE--O--GOD--I--DESERVED THAT WAS ALL
THE POISE OF HER HEAD AND THE FIRM SET OF HER LIPS TOLD THAT HER RESOLUTION WAS FORMED
I HAVE NO CONCEALMENTS FROM YOU
A DIAMOND STUD WAS SEEN TO FLASH FROM HIS BOSOM
AT ANY RATE HE AFTERWARDS ALWAYS SPOKE OF HIM AS HIS GUEST AND NOT SELDOM REFERRED TO THE SENATOR'S RELISH OF CERTAIN VIANDS ON HIS TABLE
JONSON
HIS MOTHER PO THING
WASHINGTON AND COL
IT WAS EVIDENT TO THE MOST CASUAL ACQUAINTANCE THAT HE WAS A MAN OF AFFAIRS AND THAT HIS TIME WAS ENGROSSED IN THE LARGEST SORT OF OPERATIONS ABOUT WHICH THERE WAS A MYSTERIOUS AIR
THEY STILL CURSED BENEDICT ARNOLD AS IF HE WERE A PERSONAL FRIEND WHO HAD BROKEN FAITH--BUT A WEEK GONE BY
BUT HAVE YOU KEPT THAT ALL THIS TIME LAURA'S CONFUSION WAS VERY PRETTY
WHAT AN ASS I AM WELL I'M NOT GOING TO DISPUTE A POOR PRISONER
WELL DO YOU KNOW THEY'VE QUIT BURNING WOOD IN SOME PLACES IN THE EASTERN STATES
THE LANDLORD WAITED AND PHILIP WAS PLEASED TO OBSERVE THE CHANGE IN HIS MANNER
THERE WAS MORE STIR WHEN THE COUNSEL OF THE DEFENSE APPEARED
THE EARTH IS NEVER WILLING TO YIELD ONE PRODUCT HIDDEN IN HER BOSOM WITHOUT AN EQUIVALENT FOR IT
HARRY WAS BUOYANT
IF HE COULD HAVE BEEN GRAND LLAMA OF THE UNITED STATES THAT MIGHT HAVE COME THE NEAREST TO HIS IDEA OF A POSITION
THE PETITION WAS IN HIS HANDS
IT WAS BEYOND HIS EXPERIENCE WITH WOMEN
UNDER THE CLOVER LEAF WAS WRITTEN IN A SCHOOL-GIRL'S HAND--"PHILIP JUNE 186 SQUIRE MONTAGUE THOUGHT VERY WELL OF PHILIP'S PROPOSAL
HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE MEN OF OUR COUNTRY SIR
HARRY WAKE UP MY BOY THE COAL TRAIN IS COMING
THE SENATOR TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND SEEMED TO OPEN HIS SOUL TO THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE MORNING
FORTUNE REPUTATION THESE HAD NO VALUE TO HIM EXCEPT IN RUTH'S EYES AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IF RUTH WAS NOT ON THIS EARTH HE SHOULD PLUNGE OFF INTO SOME REMOTE WILDERNESS AND LIVE IN A PURPOSELESS SECLUSION
IN THE TWO NEWSPAPERS REFERRED TO LAY THE SECRET OF HAWKINS'S GROWING PROSPERITY
DON'T LET'S EVER FRET ABOUT THE CHILDREN NANCY--NEVER IN THE WORLD
I WANT TO LOOK AT YOU GOOD
MY GOD YES YOUR WIFE OH NO IT CAN'T BE
BUT HE CAME IN NOW AND THE NEIGHBORS REVERENTLY FELL APART AND MADE WAY FOR HIM
RUTH FELT THAT SHE WAS OF LESS CONSEQUENCE IN THE HOUSEHOLD NOW THAT PHILIP HAD FOUND COAL AND PERHAPS SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO FEEL SO
YES--I DON'T KNOW BUT I HAVE
BUT IT WAS NOT THE SENATOR'S SOCIETY NOR HIS DINNERS--AT WHICH THIS SCAPEGRACE REMARKED THAT THERE WAS TOO MUCH GRACE AND TOO LITTLE WINE--WHICH ATTRACTED HIM TO THE HOUSE
AND IN TIME THESE GLORIES FADED OUT IN THE TWILIGHT AND LEFT THE FAIRY ARCHIPELAGOES REFLECTING THEIR FRINGING FOLIAGE IN THE STEELY MIRROR OF THE STREAM
BUT SHE'S GETTING HOTTER AND HOTTER ALL THE TIME THE BOAT WAS STRAINING AND GROANING AND QUIVERING LIKE A MONSTER IN PAIN
I EXPECT TO SEE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE TO-DAY MR BUCKSTONE SO YOU MUST HE OUGHT TO BE SEEN WITHOUT ANY DELAY
MR STERLING SHE CONTINUED LOOKING UP
I HOPE YOU LOVE YOUR SUNDAY SCHOOL--AH I SEE BY YOUR FACES THAT YOU DO
MRS HAWKINS HAD HASTENED TO HER DAUGHTER AS SOON AS SHE RECEIVED MONEY FOR THE JOURNEY
NO SIR JUST MAD AS A HAWNET WASHINGTON HAWKINS WAS SWORN
NO MAN HAD EVER ACCUSED COL
BUT HE HALTED
I'M TO HAVE A JOB IN THE GOLDEN BRIER MINE BY AND BY--IN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS--AND I'M GOING TO WORK HERE TILL THEN
LOUISE BOSWELL OCCUPIED HIS MIND AND DRIFTED AMONG HIS MULTIPLICATION TABLES ALL THE AFTERNOON
TIM SAID
YES THEE CAN SEE HER MRS BOLTON LED THE WAY TO THE LITTLE CHAMBER WHERE RUTH LAY
I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU THAT IT'S A GOOD DEAL BIGGER THING THAN THAT IN MISSOURI AND A SURE THING
SHE SOMETIMES TALKED TO PEOPLE IN A WAY WHICH SOME LADIES WOULD CONSIDER ACTUALLY SHOCKING
THE YOUNG LADIES PAUSED A MOMENT
THEN I SUPPOSE YOU'LL FINISH YOUR PLAN OF COLORING HEN'S EGGS BY FEEDING A PECULIAR DIET TO THE HEN NO SIR
SUPPOSE I HATED MY FATE
THE NEXT DAY PHILIP SOLD ALL THE TOOLS BUT TWO OR THREE SETS
HE ASKED ME TO LEND HIM THE NECESSARY MONEY
IT WAS SOON APPARENT THAT THIS WAS INDEED THE DINNER
YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED ABOUT ANY YET GENTLEMEN
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WASHINGTON AND HIS MOTHER NO ONE KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED
SHE CARES FOR SOMETHING BESIDES MUSTY BOOKS AND DRY BONES
WITH CHARACTER COMPACTED BY THE RIGID PURITAN DISCIPLINE OF MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES THEY HAD RETAINED ITS STRENGTH AND PURITY AND THROWN OFF ITS NARROWNESS AND WERE NOW BLOSSOMING UNDER THE GENEROUS MODERN INFLUENCES
THE TWO YOUNG GENTLEMEN WERE NEITHER STUDENTS FOR THE FALLKILL SEMINARY NOR LECTURERS ON PHYSIOLOGY NOR YET LIFE ASSURANCE SOLICITORS THREE SUPPOSITIONS THAT ALMOST EXHAUSTED THE GUESSING POWER OF THE PEOPLE AT THE HOTEL IN RESPECT TO THE NAMES OF PHILIP STERLING AND HENRY BRIERLY MISSOURI ON THE REGISTER
THERE IS NOTHING FOR ME BUT TO STAND HELPLESS AND SEE OTHER PEOPLE REAP THE ASTONISHING HARVEST NEVER MIND WASHINGTON DON'T YOU WORRY
AMUSING AS THIS SHAKER CARICATURE OF THE FRIENDS WAS IT OPPRESSED RUTH BEYOND MEASURE
HER LIFE HAD BEEN A FAILURE
THE BILL WAS FOR $180--SOMETHING MORE THAN TWICE THE MARKET VALUE OF THE LAND PERHAPS
A DEEP COUGHING SOUND TROUBLED THE STILLNESS WAY TOWARD A WOODED CAPE THAT JETTED INTO THE STREAM A MILE DISTANT
WASHINGTON RATHER LIKED HIS LOOKS
BUT SHE PUT FORTH HER HANDS AND WITH THE TEARS RAINING FROM HER EYES SAID
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON HE PUT ON HIS ROUGHEST CLOTHES AND WENT TO THE TUNNEL
SELLERS THROUGH THE HAWKINSES HAD A DEEP INTEREST
HE IS TO COME HERE TONIGHT LOOK OUT FOR HIM MY CHILD
               THE BARNARDCASTLE TRAGEDY
AH YES-YES
HE HAD NO RELATIVES--OR IF HE HAD THEY DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HIM
SHE CLOSED IN AGAIN AND THRASHED HER FIERCE WAY ALONG THE WILLOWS AS BEFORE
THE COLONEL HAD BEEN FLYING ABOUT THE CORRIDORS AND BUTTON-HOLING CONGRESSMEN ALL THE EVENING AND BELIEVED THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED A WORLD OF VALUABLE SERVICE
YAAS I KNOW
ISN'T IT SPLENDID
THERE WILL BE MADE SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEEN MILLIONS OR MORE AS'T MAY BE HANDLED           THE DEVIL IS AN ASS
IF ONES NAME IS CELEBRATED ALL OVER THE LAND ESPECIALLY AND IF SHE IS ALSO BEAUTIFUL SHE IS CERTAIN TO DRAW LARGE AUDIENCES BUT WHAT SHOULD I LECTURE ABOUT ASKED LAURA BEGINNING IN SPITE OF HERSELF TO BE A LITTLE INTERESTED AS WELL AS AMUSED
HARRY WAS EXUBERANT BUT PHILIP'S NATURAL CAUTION FOUND EXPRESSION IN HIS NEXT REMARK
AND THIS IS HOW IT CAME ABOUT THAT THE CAUTIOUS OLD SQUIRE MONTAGUE WAS DRAWN INTO THIS YOUNG FELLOW'S SPECULATION AND BEGAN TO HAVE HIS SERENE OLD AGE DISTURBED BY ANXIETIES AND BY THE HOPE OF A GREAT STROKE OF LUCK
I DON'T KNOW THE FACT WAS THAT ALICE WAS A PERSON WHO INVITED CONFIDENCES BECAUSE SHE NEVER BETRAYED THEM AND GAVE ABUNDANT SYMPATHY IN RETURN
IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR A QUIET COUNTRY GENTLEMAN TO BE MORE TAKEN WITH SUCH A VENTURE THAN A SPECULATOR WHO HAS HAD MORE EXPERIENCE IN ITS UNCERTAINTY
IF NOBLE WOULD VOTE FOR HIM HE WOULD MAKE HIM A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
WASHINGTON DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO
CHAPTER VIII

AND IT WAS NO DOUBT FROM AN UNEASY FEELING OF THE DANGER OF BEING POISONED THAT THEY KEPT EXPERIMENTING MIXING A LITTLE OF THE DANGEROUS AND CHANGING FLUID AS THEY PASSED ALONG WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE FLASKS THUS SAVING THEIR LIVES HOUR BY HOUR
I DON'T GO OUT OF THE HOUSE I FEEL SO DOWN
THANK GOD FOR THAT AMEN CAME LOW AND EARNESTLY
INDEED HE HAD LETTERS FROM HIS UNCLE WHICH HE DID NOT READ TO PHILIP DESIRING HIM TO GO TO SAN FRANCISCO TO LOOK AFTER SOME GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS IN THE HARBOR THERE
IT WAS A HANDSOME MANSION ON THE SQUARE OPPOSITE THE PRESIDENT'S HOUSE
NOW THEIR HAPPINESS WAS COMPLETE
JUDGE HAWKINS HAD WRITTEN AND ASKED CLAY TO RETURN HOME AND CONSULT WITH HIM UPON FAMILY AFFAIRS
THE COWARD
OTHERS CONSIDER IT MERELY THE ACQUISITION OF A HABIT OF TAKING EVERY MORNING BEFORE BREAKFAST A DOSE OF BITTERS COMPOSED OF WHISKEY AND ASSAFOETIDA OUT OF THE ACCLIMATION JUG
I'VE BEEN HERE TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AND DASH DASH MY DASH TO DASH IF I HAVEN'T ENTERTAINED TWENTY-FIVE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT EARTHQUAKES ONE A YEAR
I WISH HE WOULD MAKE THE GREAT SPEECH ON IT WHICH HE WANTS TO MAKE--AND THEN I WOULD MAKE ANOTHER AND WE WOULD BE SAFE WELL IF HE WANTS TO MAKE A GREAT SPEECH WHY DOESN'T HE DO IT VISITORS INTERRUPTED THE CONVERSATION AND MR BUCKSTONE TOOK HIS LEAVE
HOW THE QUICK EYES OF THE SPECTATORS ROVE FROM THE STOLID JURY TO THE KEEN LAWYERS THE IMPASSIVE JUDGE THE ANXIOUS PRISONER
NOW SHE KNEW HE DID NOT
AND I WAS SO YOUNG SO IGNORANT AND LOVED YOU SO
IF YOU HAD BEEN CONTENT TO BE MERELY A PRIVATE CITIZEN YOUR TRUNK WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT SECURITY FOR YOUR BOARD
THE CHILDREN SHALL HOLD UP THEIR HEADS WITH THE BEST IN THE LAND YET
GOOD ENOUGH COUNTRY PLENTY GOOD ENOUGH--ALL IT WANTS IS POPULATION
TAKE IT OF COURSE SAYS GRINGO TAKE ANYTHING THAT OFFERS WHY NOT BUT THEY WANT ME TO MAKE IT AN OPPOSITION PAPER WELL MAKE IT THAT
I WILL GIVE IT UP BUT HE NEVER COULD DO IT
BUT HE WAS NOT OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE MURMURED LET ALICE DO IT SHE IS NOT TOO TALL IT WAS RUTH'S FIRST CASE
I NEVER SEEMED TO SAY ANY FLAT THINGS AT ALL
BUT WHEN THEY COULD NOT THEY DEPRECATED VIOLENT EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION IN OTHER JOURNALISTIC QUARTERS
AND PHILIP FEARED THAT HE WASN'T A HERO
THE FAMILY HAD NEVER SHOWN HIM SO MUCH AFFECTION BEFORE
LET THE END BE WHAT IT MIGHT SHE WOULD MARK HER COURSE NOW--TO-DAY--AND FOLLOW IT
PROVIDENCE HAD APPARENTLY RESERVED AND SET APART THE KNOBS OF EAST TENNESSEE FOR THIS PURPOSE
WE WILL CHANGE THE SUBJECT
THIS IS A VERY DEEP MAN
JUST MET SOME GENTLEMEN FROM YOUR STATE A WEEK OR TWO AGO--VERY PROMINENT GENTLEMEN--IN PUBLIC LIFE THEY ARE
IT GREW GRAYER STILL AND RAPIDLY AFTER THE MEMORABLE DAY THAT SAW LAURA PROCLAIMED A MURDERESS
I'M SORRY I WAS BLUE BUT IT DID SEEM AS IF EVERYTHING HAD BEEN GOING AGAINST US FOR WHOLE AGES
YOU SEE I'VE BEEN DOWN TO ST LOUIS AND I HAPPENED TO RUN ACROSS OLD DR MCDOWELLS--THINKS THE WORLD OF ME DOES THE DOCTOR
OR HE ADDED AS HIS THOUGHTS TOOK A NEW TURN I WISH MY WIFE WAS IN NEW ORLEANS CHAPTER XL
BUT HER MOTHER NOTICED WITH A LITTLE ANXIETY THE SOMETIMES FLUSHED FACE AND THE SIGN OF AN EAGER SPIRIT IN THE KINDLING EYES AND AS WELL THE SERIOUS AIR OF DETERMINATION AND ENDURANCE IN HER FACE AT UNGUARDED MOMENTS
THE CLIMATE SEEMS TO BE VARIABLE IT IS ITS NATURE OF OLD HERE SAID THE DAUGHTER--STATING IT APPARENTLY AS A FACT ONLY AND BY HER MANNER WAVING ASIDE ALL PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ON ACCOUNT OF IT
SO HE GRASPED THE HANDLE WITH THE RIGHT HAND THREW THE JUG BACK UPON HIS ARM AND APPLIED HIS LIPS TO THE NOZZLE
IF I LOSE I LOSE EVERYTHING--EVEN MYSELF
DON'T THROW THEM AWAY FOR SOMETHING STILL BETTER AND MAYBE FAIL IN IT
PERHAPS IT DID NOT OCCUR TO THE NATION OF GOOD AND WORTHY PEOPLE THAT WHILE THEY CONTINUED TO SIT COMFORTABLY AT HOME AND LEAVE THE TRUE SOURCE OF OUR POLITICAL POWER THE PRIMARIES IN THE HANDS OF SALOON-KEEPERS DOG-FANCIERS AND HOD-CARRIERS THEY COULD GO ON EXPECTING ANOTHER CASE OF THIS KIND AND EVEN DOZENS AND HUNDREDS OF THEM AND NEVER BE DISAPPOINTED
HER LIFE DURING ONE HOUR OF EACH DAY UPON THE PLATFORM WOULD BE A RAPTUROUS INTOXICATION--AND WHEN THE CURTAIN FELL AND THE LIGHTS WERE OUT AND THE PEOPLE GONE TO NESTLE IN THEIR HOMES AND FORGET HER SHE WOULD FIND IN SLEEP OBLIVION OF HER HOMELESSNESS IF SHE COULD IF NOT SHE WOULD BRAVE OUT THE NIGHT IN SOLITUDE AND WAIT FOR THE NEXT DAY'S HOUR OF ECSTASY
I AM IN A SIMPLE REMOTE UNPRETENDING SETTLEMENT OF MY OWN DEAR STATE AND THESE ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE NOBLE AND VIRTUOUS MEN WHO HAVE MADE ME WHAT I AM
DILWORTHY SHOWED A LIST OF MEN WHO WOULD VOTE FOR HIM--A MAJORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE
IF SPECTATORS OFFEND AGAIN THE SERGEANT-AT-ARMS WILL CLEAR THE GALLERIES THEN HE CAST HIS EYES ALOFT AND GAZED AT SOME OBJECT ATTENTIVELY FOR A MOMENT
TO GET A LITTLE START IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NEW RAILROAD AND MAKE A LITTLE MONEY SO THAT I COULD COME EAST AND ENGAGE IN SOMETHING MORE SUITED TO MY TASTES
LORD BLESS YOU--I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU WASHINGTON--PERFECTLY DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU MY BOY
IT IS CUSTOMARY TO CARRY LARGE SUMS OF MONEY IN BANK BILLS ABOUT YOUR PERSON OR IN YOUR TRUNK
HIS GOOD FORTUNE AT THIS MOMENT SEEMED AN EMPTY MOCKERY ONE OF THOSE SARCASMS OF FATE SUCH AS THAT WHICH SPREADS A DAINTY BANQUET FOR THE MAN WHO HAS NO APPETITE
BESIDES THE SAFETY OF SOCIETY THE DECENCIES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE WHAT WE CALL OUR MODERN CIVILIZATION ALL WOULD DEMAND THAT LAURA SHOULD BE DISPOSED OF IN THE MANNER WE HAVE DESCRIBED
THAT--THAT IS A VERY VALUABLE PROPERTY--VERY VALUABLE
DILWORTHY SAID HE WOULD FIX THAT
ONCE HE HEARD OF HIM AT A HOTEL IN WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON DREAMED HIS WAY ALONG THE STREET HIS FANCY FLITTING FROM GRAIN TO HOGS FROM HOGS TO BANKS FROM BANKS TO EYE-WATER FROM EYE-WATER TO TENNESSEE LAND AND LINGERING BUT A FEVERISH MOMENT UPON EACH OF THESE FASCINATIONS
SHE WOULD TURN TO THAT FINAL RESORT OF THE DISAPPOINTED OF HER SEX THE LECTURE PLATFORM
SOME SAID THE WOMAN SHOWED THE CALMNESS AND INDIFFERENCE OF INSANITY
I DO NOT LIKE TO USE IT THE COLONEL INTERRUPTED HIMSELF AT THIS POINT TO MEET AN ENGAGEMENT WITH THE AUSTRIAN MINISTER AND TOOK HIS LEAVE WITH HIS USUAL COURTLY BOW
WE'VE STRUCK IT THIS WAS THE ANNOUNCEMENT AT THE TENT DOOR THAT WOKE PHILIP OUT OF A SOUND SLEEP AT DEAD OF NIGHT AND SHOOK ALL THE SLEEPINESS OUT OF HIM IN A TRICE
IT IS MY DUTY GENTLEMEN TO UNFOLD TO YOU ONE OF THE MOST AFFECTING DRAMAS IN ALL THE HISTORY OF MISFORTUNE
THAT WAS WIDE OPEN TO ADMIT THE AIR BUT THE AIR THAT CAME IN WAS HOT AND LIFELESS
I'LL RESERVE EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE IRON AND I'LL SELL THEM THE IRON PROPERTY FOR $15,000 CASH I TO GO IN WITH THEM AND OWN AN UNDIVIDED INTEREST OF ONE-HALF THE CONCERN--OR THE STOCK AS YOU MAY SAY
HE KNOCKED AT HER DOOR BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER
THEY ALL SEEMED TO THINK HIS DISAPPOINTMENT OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN THEIR OWN MISFORTUNE
YOU DO NOT DENY THAT EVEN IN PUBLIC
WHAT A HEAD HE HAS GOT
THE CLAMOR GREW STRONGER AND LOUDER AND INSULTING SPEECHES WERE SHOUTED AT HER
I BELIEVE MAJOR LACKLAND IS NOT LIVING COLONEL THERE WAS AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE SENSE OF PLEASURE BETRAYED IN THE COLONEL'S FACE AT THIS PROMPT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS TITLE
FOREIGN MINISTERS WERE VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE AT HAPPY INTERVALS
WHAT MADE YOU SHOOT HIM MISS HAWKINS LAURA'S ONLY REPLY WAS VERY SIMPLY DID I SHOOT HIM
LOVE TRAVEL EVEN DEATH ITSELF WAITED ON THE CHANCES OF THE DIES DAILY THROWN IN THE TWO HOUSES AND THE COMMITTEE ROOMS THERE
BUT I GRIEVE FOR HIS MISTAKEN IDEAS OF CONFERRING HAPPINESS UPON HIS CHILDREN
SHE IS A DEAR GIRL SAID PHILIP WHEN RUTH SHOWED HIM THE LETTER
HE COULD NEVER REFUSE SUCH APPEALS
THE INSTANT MR BUCKSTONE SAT DOWN THE STORM BURST FORTH
WE MUST HAVE IMPROVEMENTS
EVERYBODY LIKED THE YOUNG FELLOW FOR HOW COULD THEY HELP LIKING ONE OF SUCH ENGAGING MANNERS AND LARGE FORTUNE
HE GAVE UP HIS ENTERPRISE LEANED HIS SHOULDER AGAINST A FLUTED PILASTER AND POUTED WHILE HE KEPT WATCH UPON LAURA'S EVERY MOVEMENT
MAKE HIM ONE OF THOSE POOR HARD WORKING UNSALARIED CORPORATORS AND LET HIM DO EVERY BODY GOOD WITH THOSE MILLIONS--AND GO HUNGRY HIMSELF
WELL I DUNNO SKASELY
IT WAS A MEDICAL WORK AND TO ALL APPEARANCE ABOUT AS INTERESTING TO A GIRL OF EIGHTEEN AS THE STATUTES AT LARGE
ALICE WAS LOYAL TO RUTH AND IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING SHE DID NOT BETRAY HER FRIEND
HAWKINS DREW REIN AND ENTERED THE YARD
THIS CLAYEY STUFF IS WHAT I'VE LONGED FOR--I KNOW WHAT IS BEHIND IT HE SWUNG HIS PICK WITH HEARTY GOOD WILL TILL LONG AFTER THE DARKNESS HAD GATHERED UPON THE EARTH AND WHEN HE TRUDGED HOME AT LENGTH HE KNEW HE HAD A COAL VEIN AND THAT IT WAS SEVEN FEET THICK FROM WALL TO WALL
YOU ARE MY TRUE FRIEND
SHE SHALL TURN THE MEN'S HEADS AND I'LL TURN THE WOMEN'S
HE TELEGRAPHED THE COLONEL TO GO DOWN AND QUIET THE LABORERS--HE WAS BOUND EAST FOR MONEY--EVERYTHING WOULD BE RIGHT IN A WEEK--TELL THE MEN SO--TELL THEM TO RELY ON HIM AND NOT BE AFRAID
I WILL SET MINE WHILE I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY BUT SHE COULD NOT GET HER WATCH OPEN APPARENTLY
I DID NOT GIVE ANY NOTE OR RECEIPT FOR THE SAME
AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY SHE CHARGED SELBY WITH HIS INTENTION TO ABANDON HER
AT THE END OF NEARLY A WEEK OF TRAVEL THE PARTY WENT INTO CAMP NEAR A SHABBY VILLAGE WHICH WAS CAVING HOUSE BY HOUSE INTO THE HUNGRY MISSISSIPPI
YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT I ASKED YOU TO TELL ME WHAT SORT OF BOOKS I WANTED--FOR I AM APT TO SAY THINGS WHICH I DON'T REALLY MEAN WHEN I AM ABSENT MINDED
ONE JOURNAL HAD A LONG DISPATCH FROM HAWKEYE REPORTING THE EXCITEMENT IN THAT QUIET VILLAGE AND THE RECEPTION OF THE AWFUL INTELLIGENCE
THE PAGE WAS BLANK AND WAITING FOR ITS FIRST RECORD
I WOULDN'T WANT ANY BETTER TITLE THAN THAT
SHE WAS THE MOST GAY SERIOUS PERSON HE EVER SAW
IT WAS AS IF TWO FRIENDS PARTED ON A WIDE PLAIN THE ONE TO JOURNEY TOWARDS THE SETTING AND THE OTHER TOWARDS THE RISING SUN EACH COMPREHENDING THAT EVERY STEP HENCEFORTH MUST SEPARATE THEIR LIVES WIDER AND WIDER
IT SAID OUR REPEATED PREDICTIONS ARE VERIFIED
DIAMOND NEVER SHONE WITH SUCH LUSTRE IN THE EYES OF PHILIP
THEY'LL ALL GO OF COURSE
FAR AND WIDE HE WAS CALLED A THIEF A BRIBER A PROMOTER OF STEAMSHIP SUBSIDIES RAILWAY SWINDLES ROBBERIES OF THE GOVERNMENT IN ALL POSSIBLE FORMS AND FASHIONS
HE ONLY SAID
YES CONTINUED THIS PUBLIC BENEFACTOR AN UNCOMMON POOR LOT THIS YEAR UNCOMMON
FORGET ALL THIS MISERABLE TALK
FOR EVEN THE MOST DEVOUT MEN AND BUSY STATESMEN MUST HAVE HOURS OF RELAXATION
THIS WAS THE SUBSTANCE OF SUSAN'S TESTIMONY WHICH WAS NOT SHAKEN IN THE LEAST BY SEVERE CROSS-EXAMINATION
WE MUST HAVE MORE OF THAT SORT
AT INTERVALS HE SAID
IT WAS AN INFAMOUS CONDITION IN SOCIETY THAT GEORGE SHOULD BE TIED TO HER
THE STORY I HAVE TO TELL IS OF A LOVELY LITTLE GIRL WITH SUNNY HAIR AND LAUGHING EYES TRAVELING WITH HER PARENTS EVIDENTLY PEOPLE OF WEALTH AND REFINEMENT UPON A MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOAT
BUT WHERE IS IT MY DEAR SIR YOU SURPRISE ME
A SPARK OF LIGHT NOW APPEARED IN THE FAR END OF THE TUNNEL AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE HE FOUND THE MAN TIM AT WORK
IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO LECTURE IN ORDER TO GO INTO THE LECTURE TOUR
HOW SWEET WAS THE SUNLIGHT HOW EXHILARATING THE SENSE OF FREEDOM
MY PRESENCE SEEMS TO DEPRESS YOU IT'S NOT YOUR PRESENCE BUT YOUR ABSENCE WHEN YOU ARE PRESENT BEGAN PHILIP DOLEFULLY WITH THE IDEA THAT HE WAS SAYING A RATHER DEEP THING
THE GIRLS HAD GROWN UP AS SISTERS AND THEY WERE BOTH TOO YOUNG AT THE TIME OF THE FEARFUL ACCIDENT ON THE MISSISSIPPI TO KNOW THAT IT WAS THAT WHICH HAD THROWN THEIR LIVES TOGETHER
IT REPLIED IT IS THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD
HER GRIEF SO WROUGHT UPON LAURA THAT THE GIRL ALMOST FORGOT HER OWN TROUBLES FOR THE MOMENT IN HER COMPASSION FOR HER MOTHER'S DISTRESS
AND IN THIS CONGENIAL AIR THE COLONEL SEEMED EVEN TO HIMSELF TO EXPAND INTO SOMETHING LARGE AND MYSTERIOUS
PERHAPS HE COULD READ LAW IN SQUIRE MONTAGUE'S OFFICE WHILE EARNING HIS BREAD AS A TEACHER IN THE SEMINARY
WHEN WASHINGTON LEFT THE BREAKFAST TABLE HE COULD HAVE WORSHIPED THAT MAN
THEY SOON MOVED AND CARRIED ITS SECOND READING AND AFTER A STRONG SHARP FIGHT CARRIED A MOTION TO GO INTO COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
THERE IS WHERE THAT MINORITY BECOMES AN OBSTRUCTION--BUT STILL ONE CAN'T SAY IT IS ON THE WRONG SIDE.--WELL AFTER THEY HAVE FINISHED THE BRIBERY CASES THEY WILL TAKE UP CASES OF MEMBERS WHO HAVE BOUGHT THEIR SEATS WITH MONEY
I WONDER WHAT IS IN THE WIND
BUT HIS DIFFICULTY WAS QUICKLY SOLVED
AND IT IS A SHEER WASTE OF THE TIME FOR WHICH THE NATION PAYS THOSE MEN TO WORK--THAT IS WHAT THAT IS
IF THIS BLESSED MAN OFFERS BUT A THOUSAND I'LL EMBRACE HIM LIKE A BROTHER THE STRANGER SAID
BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR AN INSTANT
BOSWELL'S
IDLING MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE FLOCKED TO THEIR SEATS NERVOUS GENTLEMEN SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PAGES FLEW HITHER AND THITHER LIFE AND ANIMATION WERE VISIBLE EVERYWHERE ALL THE LONG RANKS OF FACES IN THE BUILDING WERE KINDLED
WHY OUR HEADQUARTERS WOULD BE IN CONSTANTINOPLE AND OUR HINDQUARTERS IN FURTHER INDIA
WHO IS HE BLANCHE WHO IS HE
WHEN SHE SPOKE HER VOICE WAS VERY UNSTEADY AND SHE LOOKED DOWN
HE HAD LOOKED UPON THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF AND LIVED
AH HERE WE ARE
WHEN MR NOBLE'S BOMBSHELL FELL IN SENATOR DILWORTHY'S CAMP THE STATESMAN WAS DISCONCERTED FOR A MOMENT
BUT YOU MUST BE COMFORTABLE NOW
AIN'T $350,000 A YEAR A PRETTY REAL STUFF
HE IS A MASTER OF THOSE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS RUTH
WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD FROM COL
NOW HERE WE ARE AT NAPOLEON
DILWORTHY SAID IT WAS A GREAT DEAL TOO MUCH
LET'S GO DOWN TO NEWSPAPER ROW--MEET HIM ON THE WAY WHILE THEY WERE PASSING ALONG THE AVENUE THEY SAW SOMEONE PUTTING UP A GREAT DISPLAY-SHEET ON THE BULLETIN BOARD OF A NEWSPAPER OFFICE AND AN EAGER CROWD OF MEN WAS COLLECTING ABORT THE PLACE
THEY KEEP THE WORLD ACTIVE AND I OWE A GREAT MANY OF MY BEST OPERATIONS TO SUCH MEN
B IS A GENERAL SIGN FOR A RELATIVE
IT IS ABOUT THE SHAPE IT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IF HE HAD SPOKEN IT ALOUD
SUTLER OF MASSACHUSETTS DEFIED ENGLAND AND THEY SAY HE WANTS WAR HE WANTS TO MAKE HIMSELF CONSPICUOUS MORE LIKE SAID LAURA
THERE WAS A CONCERT ONE NIGHT AT THE MUSICAL FUND HALL AND THE FOUR HAD ARRANGED TO GO IN AND RETURN BY THE GERMANTOWN CARS
THINK OF THE STONE SHINGLES OF THE ROOF EIGHT INCHES THICK
HE URGED THE PRESIDENT TO PAY HIM A VISIT DURING THE RECESS AND SEE HIS STOCK FARM
OH NO THAT WON'T DO
WASHINGTON BROUGHT HER ONE OF HIS REVOLVERS AND INSTRUCTED HER IN THE ART OF LOADING AND FIRING IT
AND YET NOT FROM THE AIRY OUTLOOKS OF THE DOME BY THE WAY BECAUSE TO GET THERE YOU MUST PASS THROUGH THE GREAT ROTUNDA
SHE WOULD SHOW THESE PEOPLE WHAT A HUNTED AND PERSECUTED WOMAN COULD DO
THE MEN WERE DISCHARGED THE TOOLS WERE HOUSED THE HOPEFUL NOISE OF PICKMAN AND DRIVER CEASED AND THE MINING CAMP HAD THAT DESOLATE AND MOURNFUL ASPECT WHICH ALWAYS HOVERS OVER A FRUSTRATED ENTERPRISE
A NOBLE STRUGGLING YOUNG SPIRIT PERSECUTED BY MISFORTUNE BUT BRAVELY AND PATIENTLY WAITING IN THE SHADOW OF A DREAD CALAMITY AND PREPARING TO MEET THE BLOW AS BECAME ONE WHO WAS ALL TOO USED TO HARD FORTUNE AND THE PITILESS BUFFETINGS OF FATE
SHE HAD TOLD HER PARENTS TOO AND ALSO SEVERAL BOSOM FRIENDS
TO LEARN TO BE PROPS AND PILLARS OF THE STATE AND SHINING LIGHTS IN THE COUNCILS AND THE HOUSEHOLDS OF THE NATION
OTHER PEOPLE WILL JUDGE DIFFERENTLY INDEED THEY WON'T
YOU WOULDN'T SELL ONE OF THEM AT A GOOD ROUND FIGURE NOT FOR ALL THE MONEY IN THE BANK SI MY OWN SENTIMENTS EVERY TIME
AND THEN MORTGAGE THEM FOR MONEY ENOUGH TO GET THE ROAD WELL ON
THAT IS WHAT WE'VE COME TO SAY PHILIP WAS TOUCHED
THERE WAS THE LURID SKY LINE OF THE WOODED RANGE ALONG THE BASE OF WHICH THEY WERE CRAWLING
I'VE LEFT MY POCKET-BOOK
MR BUCKSTONE HAD REPORTED THE BILLS FROM HIS COMMITTEE ONE BY ONE LEAVING THE BILL TO THE LAST
SOMETIMES I HALF WISH I HAD NOT BEGUN
EACH TIME THE VERDICT WAS
AND THAT WASHINGTON'S WORK WOULD BE LIGHT AND HE WOULD GET FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH AND BE BOARDED AND LODGED IN THE GENERAL'S FAMILY--WHICH WAS AS GOOD AS TEN DOLLARS MORE
THIS SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME BY INCHES THEN CAME ANOTHER TELEGRAM
WE FEEL CERTAIN THAT THE VERDICT WILL BE RENDERED TO-DAY
HE BUSTLED ABOUT THE ROOM LONG AFTER EVERY ONE ELSE WAS SEATED AND LOUDLY CRIED ORDER IN THE DEAD SILENCE WHICH PRECEDED THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SENATOR BY GEN
PHILIP WAS NOT INVINCIBLE TO HER BEAUTY NOR TO THE INTELLECTUAL CHARM OF HER PRESENCE
THEN THE VOTE WAS TAKEN ON THE ADOPTION OF THE REPORT AND IT CARRIED BY A SURPRISING MAJORITY
SHE IS AN ORPHAN
ONE OF THESE DAYS IT WILL BE THE RICH MISS EMILY HAWKINS--AND THE WEALTHY MISS LAURA VAN BRUNT HAWKINS--AND THE HON
CHAPTER IX
AND IF I HAD A FORTUNE WOULD THEE WANT ME TO LEAD A USELESS LIFE HAS THY MOTHER LED A USELESS LIFE SOMEWHAT THAT DEPENDS UPON WHETHER HER CHILDREN AMOUNT TO ANYTHING RETORTED THE SHARP LITTLE DISPUTANT
SOME THOUGHT BRIERLY WAS AN ACCOMPLICE AND THAT HE HAD SET THE WOMAN ON TO KILL HIS RIVAL
MY GOD I THOUGHT I HATED HIM THE COLONEL KNELT BESIDE HER
PHILIP LEFT THE CAPITOL AND WALKED UP PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE IN COMPANY WITH SENATOR DILWORTHY
SELBY SHE TURNED THE PISTOL TOWARDS HER OWN BREAST AND WITNESS SNATCHED IT FROM HER
ALL IN AN INSTANT A FIERCE EYE OF FIRE SHOT OUT FROM BEHIND THE CAPE AND SENT A LONG BRILLIANT PATHWAY QUIVERING ATHWART THE DUSKY WATER
HE TALKED INDEED MORE WITH ALICE THAN WITH RUTH AND SCARCELY CONCEALED FROM HER THE TROUBLE THAT WAS IN HIS MIND
NEVER DID MEN WORK WITH A HEARTIER WILL THAN DID THOSE STALWART BRAVES WITH THE AXES
THE COLONEL FOLLOWED HIM TO THE DOOR PROMISING OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT HE WOULD USE HIS INFLUENCE TO GET SOME OF THE EARLY MALCOLMS FOR HIM AND INSISTING THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE SUCH A STRANGER BUT COME AND TAKE POT-LUCK WITH HIM EVERY CHANCE HE GOT
AND THE SWEET LITTLE WORD MADE HIS HEART BEAT LIKE A TRIP-HAMMER FOR NEVER IN ALL HER LIFE HAD SHE SAID THEE TO HIM BEFORE
AND THE LADY AND GENTLEMAN WERE SHOWN TO THE PARLOR IN WHICH WERE AT THE TIME THREE OR FOUR OTHER PERSONS
THE CORONER'S JURY FOUND CERTAIN MEMORANDA UPON HIS BODY AND ABOUT THE PREMISES WHICH REVEALED A FACT NOT SUSPECTED BY THE VILLAGERS BEFORE-VIZ THAT LAURA WAS NOT THE CHILD OF MR AND MRS HAWKINS
THAT'S IT
THIS DOOR FRAMED A SMALL SQUARE OF ISINGLASS WHICH NOW WARMED UP WITH A FAINT GLOW
BUT I SAID YES YES
A DREARY MEMBER WAS SPEAKING
THE DARKNESS GATHERED THE SNOW WAS FALLING THE WIND WAILED PLAINTIVELY ABOUT THE HOUSE OR SHOOK IT WITH FITFUL GUSTS
IT IS NOT FOR US TO ANALYZE THE PASSION AND SAY WHETHER IT WAS A WORTHY ONE
THE BRAG APPEARED TO BE ALL TAKEN OUT OF HIM AND HIS AIRY MANNER ONLY ASSERTED ITSELF NOW AND THEN IN A COMICAL IMITATION OF ITS OLD SELF
IT WAS IN VAIN THAT HE APPLIED TO HIS BUSINESS ACQUAINTANCES AND FRIENDS
THE COURT ROOM WAS PACKED ON THE MORNING ON WHICH THE VERDICT OF THE JURY WAS EXPECTED AS IT HAD BEEN EVERY DAY OF THE TRIAL AND BY THE SAME SPECTATORS WHO HAD FOLLOWED ITS PROGRESS WITH SUCH INTENSE INTEREST
SELBY DOES NOT MEAN YOU ANY GOOD
HAVE NOT THESE BIG BABIES WITH BEARDS FILLED ALL LITERATURE WITH THEIR OUTCRIES THEIR GRIEFS AND THEIR LAMENTATIONS
HE LOVED HER TOO PASSIONATELY TO CREDIT THAT FOR A MOMENT
MRS HAWKINS SPRANG IN BEAMING
IT MAKES A MAN'S BRAIN WHIRL
IT WAS COLONEL WON'T YOU COME AND DINE WITH US
IS IT TRUE THAT HE GAVE MONEY TO HELP BUILD THE PRETTY LITTLE CHURCH OF ST JAMES THE LESS AND THAT HE IS ONE OF THE VESTRYMEN YES
LET ME HAVE A DIME WASHINGTON IF YOU'VE GOT--AH THANKS
SHE WAS CLEAR DECISIVE AND PEREMPTORY IN WHATEVER SHE DID
THE WASHINGTON PAPERS WERE MORE RESPECTFUL AS USUAL--AND CONCILIATORY ALSO AS USUAL
IF THEE WANTS TO SEE NEW BONNETS ORTHODOX TO A SHADE AND CONFORMED TO THE LETTER OF THE TRUE FORM THEE MUST GO TO THE ARCH STREET MEETING
IT WAS THOUGHT BEST THAT WASHINGTON SHOULD COME HOME
HE ALSO SOLD ONE OF THE NOW DESERTED CABINS AS OLD LUMBER TOGETHER WITH ITS DOMESTIC WARES
IS THERE ANYTHING MORE YOU'LL FIND SOME CHANGES IN THAT I GUESS HANDING THE SENATOR A PRINTED LIST OF NAMES
BUT THE MAN DEPARTED LEAVING AN EMPTY TRUNK THE DAY BEFORE THE MAJOR WENT THERE
WITH MR BOLTON HE WAS THE SERIOUS MAN OF BUSINESS ENJOYING THE CONFIDENCE OF MANY OF THE MONIED MEN IN NEW YORK WHOM MR BOLTON KNEW AND ENGAGED WITH THEM IN RAILWAY SCHEMES AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
THE SENATOR WAS NOT IN AN EXULTANT MOOD BUT RATHER IN A CONDITION OF HOLY JOY BEFITTING A CHRISTIAN STATESMAN WHOSE BENEVOLENT PLANS PROVIDENCE HAS MADE ITS OWN AND STAMPED WITH APPROVAL
BOTH PILOTS WERE AT WORK NOW ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE WHEEL WITH THEIR COATS AND VESTS OFF THEIR BOSOMS AND COLLARS WIDE OPEN AND THE PERSPIRATION FLOWING DOWN HEIR FACES
THERE WAS NO MISTAKE THIS TIME
AND HARRY'S A GOOD FELLOW AND ALWAYS DOES THE VERY BEST HE KNOWS HOW BUT THEN HE'S YOUNG--RATHER YOUNG FOR SOME PARTS OF SUCH WORK YOU KNOW--AND BESIDES HE TALKS TOO MUCH TALKS A GOOD DEAL TOO MUCH
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE LAURA WAS THE FIRST WORD THE COLONEL COULD GET OUT
DON'T SEEM TOO ANXIOUS DEAR I WON'T
THAT'S ALL RIGHT--WHEN A MAN WORKS FOR ME--WHEN A MAN--IN THE OTHER POCKET I RECKON--WHEN A MAN--WHY WHERE THE MISCHIEF AS THAT PORTMONNAIE!--WHEN A--WELL NOW THAT'S ODD--OH NOW I REMEMBER MUST HAVE LEFT IT AT THE BANK
ORDER IN THE COURT THE JUDGE
COACHES THAT FLY OVER THE GROUND TWENTY MILES AN HOUR--HEAVENS AND EARTH THINK OF THAT NANCY
MY DEAR SIR BY AND BY THERE IS GOING TO BE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THAT NATIONAL INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT DIRECTORS RELIEF MEASURE OF A FEW YEARS AGO AND YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT YOU WILL BE A CRIPPLED MAN AS LIKELY AS NOT WHEN IT IS COMPLETED IT CANNOT BE SHOWN THAT A MAN IS A KNAVE MERELY FOR OWNING THAT STOCK
HE DID NOT ADD THAT HE DETESTED TURNIPS EVEN WHEN THEY WERE COOKED--LOATHED THEM IN THEIR NATURAL STATE
THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL GET FOR PRETENDING TO BE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS
THE CLOUDS ARE ALL GONE OUR LONG STRUGGLE IS ENDED OUR TROUBLES ARE ALL OVER
IT IS THE ODDEST FREAK
AMONG THE ASSETS OF THE BOLTON PROPERTY THE ILIUM TRACT WAS SOLD AND PHILIP BOUGHT IT IN AT THE VENDUE FOR A SONG FOR NO ONE CARED TO EVEN UNDERTAKE THE MORTGAGE ON IT EXCEPT HIMSELF
I SHOULD GO ON MYSELF WROTE THE COLONEL BUT I AM ENGAGED IN THE INVENTION OF A PROCESS FOR LIGHTING SUCH A CITY AS ST LOUIS BY MEANS OF WATER
WASHINGTON HAWKINS STOOD AT HER BEDSIDE
MR SELLERS DID YOU KNOW A MAJOR LACKLAND KNEW HIM WELL SIR KNEW HIM AND HONORED HIM SIR
THE SPEAKER SAID
NOBLE WAS WORKING HARD TOO BUT MATTERS WERE AGAINST HIM HE WAS NOT MAKING MUCH PROGRESS
THE STATE WOULD PROVE THAT LAURA HAWKINS THE PRISONER AT THE BAR A FIEND IN THE FORM OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SHOT DEAD GEORGE SELBY A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN AT THE TIME AND PLACE DESCRIBED
THERE DON'T CRY I CANNOT GO BACK TO THAT LIFE MRS HAWKINS WAS SOBBING
QUESTION THE SHARP BLOWS OF THE SPEAKER'S GAVEL ROSE ABOVE THE DIN
THE MINE TURNED OUT EVEN BETTER THAN WAS AT FIRST HOPED AND WOULD IF JUDICIOUSLY MANAGED BE A FORTUNE TO THEM ALL
PHILIP HAD TO LOOK ABOUT HIM FOR SOMETHING TO DO
THE PROSPECTING WAS STILL GOING ON
THE JURY OF INQUEST FOUND THAT DEATH HAD RESULTED FROM HEART DISEASE AND WAS INSTANT AND PAINLESS
NOW CLEAR OUT JERRY YOUR COMPLEXION HAS BROUGHT ON THE TWILIGHT HALF AN HOUR AHEAD OF TIME
THE LIGHT HEARTED FELLOW GLORIED IN THESE SHINING ENCASEMENTS OF HIS WELL SHAPED LEGS AND TOLD PHILIP THAT THEY WERE A PERFECT PROTECTION AGAINST PRAIRIE RATTLE-SNAKES WHICH NEVER STRIKE ABOVE THE KNEE
SHE JEST WORSHIPED CLAY--AND CLAY HE WORSHIPED HER
AIN'T SHE FATHER ALL THE CHILDREN CHIMED IN NOW WITH ONE GENERAL BABEL OF INFORMATION ABOUT DECEASED--NOBODY OFFERING TO READ THE RIOT ACT OR SEEMING TO DISCOUNTENANCE THE INSURRECTION OR DISAPPROVE OF IT IN ANY WAY--BUT THE HEAD TWIN DROWNED ALL THE TURMOIL AND HELD HIS OWN AGAINST THE FIELD
NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE BELONGED OR WHITHER HE HAD GONE
THAT RUTH HAD THIS DELIGHT IN THE MERE SURFACE PLAY OF LIFE THAT SHE COULD FOR INSTANCE BE INTERESTED IN THAT SOMEWHAT SERIOUS BY-PLAY CALLED FLIRTATION OR TAKE ANY DELIGHT IN THE EXERCISE OF THOSE LITTLE ARTS OF PLEASING AND WINNING WHICH ARE NONE THE LESS GENUINE AND CHARMING BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT INTELLECTUAL RUTH HERSELF HAD NEVER SUSPECTED UNTIL SHE WENT TO FALLKILL
MOST OF THE INDICATIONS WERE THERE BUT NOT ALL OF THEM NOT ALL OF THEM
MEANTIME THE WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENTS WERE SENDING SUCH TELEGRAMS AS THESE ABROAD IN THE LAND
AT ANY RATE WE MUST NOT GIVE UP THE MINE SO LONG AS WE HAVE ANY SHOW ALAS
IF DEY'D BEN GALS DEY'D MISSED DEY LONG HAAH HAIR MAYBE BUT DEY WOULDN'T FELT DE BURN I DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT THEY WERE GIRLS
TAKE THE CHAIR NEXT TO MRS SELLERS WASHINGTON--TUT TUT MARIE ANTOINETTE LET YOUR BROTHER HAVE THE FORK IF HE WANTS IT YOU ARE BIGGER THAN HE IS WASHINGTON CONTEMPLATED THE BANQUET AND WONDERED IF HE WERE IN HIS RIGHT MIND
IF IT PLEASE THE COURT SAID MR BRAHAM RISING IMPRESSIVELY YOUR HONOR HAS PERMITTED THE PROSECUTION AND I HAVE SUBMITTED WITHOUT A WORD TO GO INTO THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY TESTIMONY TO ESTABLISH A MOTIVE
HIS TALK WITH A GENEROUS STRANGER WHO OFFERED HIM A HOME
EVERYBODY IS IN THESE DAYS
LIKE SOME OTHER GREAT BEAUTIES AND BELLES IN WASHINGTON HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN WHISPERS THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE LOBBY
IT IS THE FASHION IN NEW ENGLAND TO GIVE INDIAN NAMES TO THE PUBLIC HOUSES NOT THAT THE LATE LAMENTED SAVAGE KNEW HOW TO KEEP A HOTEL BUT THAT HIS WARLIKE NAME MAY IMPRESS THE TRAVELER WHO HUMBLY CRAVES SHELTER THERE AND MAKE HIM GRATEFUL TO THE NOBLE AND GENTLEMANLY CLERK IF HE IS ALLOWED TO DEPART WITH HIS SCALP SAFE
HIS FACE WAS CLEAN SHAVEN AND HE HAD A WIDE MOUTH AND RATHER SMALL DARK EYES SET QUITE TOO NEAR TOGETHER
SHE WAS INDICTED FOR MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE AND HELD FOR TRIAL AT THE SUMMER TERM
SHE HIT THE BOTTOM
OR WOULD HE SNEER AS WHEN SHE LAST SAW HIM
TURNIPS AND WATER
$500 98.  DOCUMENTARY PROOF 99.  COLONEL SELLERS DESPONDENT 100.  TAIL PIECE 101.  THE MONARCH OF ALL HE SURVEYS 102.  PHILIP THRUST FROM THE R
MRS HAWKINS SHARED NOT AT ALL IN THIS FEELING
THAT PARTY IS GOING TO SUCCEED IT'S GOING TO ELECT THE NEXT PRESIDENT I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID PHILIP STOUTLY ITS WRONG IN PRINCIPLE AND IT OUGHT NOT TO SUCCEED BUT I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN GO FOR A THING I DON'T BELIEVE IN O VERY WELL SAID GRINGO TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THANKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL
POSSIBLY PHILIP DID NOT THINK HOW MUCH THE ATTRACTIONS OF FALLKILL WERE INCREASED BY THE PRESENCE OF ALICE THERE
AND MEANTIME I'M WITH THE ENGINEERS TO SPY OUT THE BEST LAND AND THE DEPOT SITES IT'S EVERYTHING SUGGESTED THE COLONEL IN KNOWING WHERE TO INVEST
THE TRACKS OF OTHER ROADS WERE CROSSED
HER INTIMACY WITH SELBY WAS OPEN GOSSIP AND THERE WERE WINKS AND THRUSTINGS OF THE TONGUE IN ANY GROUP OF MEN WHEN SHE PASSED BY
THAT WAS HER THOUGHT
SAY I WAS KILLED IN AN INSTANT AND NEVER KNEW WHAT HURT ME--THOUGH GOD KNOWS I'VE NEITHER SCRATCH NOR BRUISE THIS MOMENT
SELLERS DID YOU EVER SEE THIS MAN THIS SUPPOSED FATHER NO SIR
AND THE PURRING LITTLE WIFE DILIGENT WITH HER KNITTING SAT NEAR AT HAND AND LOOKED HAPPY AND PROUD AND GRATEFUL
I THINK SHE IS A FINE GIRL EVERY WAY AND SO WOULD YOU IF YOU KNEW HER AS WELL AS I DO
HE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM DESPONDING BEFORE
IF THE PUBLIC HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE EXISTENCE OF LAURA AND HER CRIME THEY WERE REMINDED OF ALL THE DETAILS OF THE MURDER BY THE NEWSPAPERS WHICH FOR SOME DAYS HAD BEEN ANNOUNCING THE APPROACHING TRIAL
ONE WORD SAID THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
WHERE'LL IT BE BY THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER
IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT COL
AND HE HAD INVITED HARRY TO COME WITH HIM
HE WAS ALWAYS HAPPY AND CONTENTED WITH ALICE
YOU DON'T CHANGE WASHINGTON
THE NOVELIST WHO WOULD TURN LOOSE UPON SOCIETY AN INSANE MURDERESS COULD NOT ESCAPE CONDEMNATION
LAURA WILL BE QUEEN OF AMERICA NOW AND SHE WILL BE APPLAUDED AND HONORED AND PETTED BY THE WHOLE NATION
AND IF A CROWD OF GAPING RUSTICS WERE LOOKING ON ALL THE WHILE IT WAS PERFECTLY SATISFACTORY TO HIM
IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT PHILIP WOULD HAVE TO GO ALSO HER LAWYER WROTE BUT THEY HOPED FOR A POSTPONEMENT
IT'S ABOUT SOME LAND UP IN THE COUNTRY
I SAID I HAD NO MONEY JUST THEN BUT WORLD TRY TO BORROW IT
A FAMILIAR FACE APPEARED IN THE MIDST OF THE MULTITUDE AND HARRY BRIERLY FOUGHT HIS DIFFICULT WAY TO HER SIDE HIS EYES SHOUTING THEIR GRATIFICATION SO TO SPEAK
AND AS HIS SOUL HOVERED UPON THE BRINK OF UNCONCIOUSNESS HE HEAVED A LONG DEEP SIGH AND SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IN HIS HEART HE HAD CURSED THE COLONEL'S PREVENTIVE OF RHEUMATISM BEFORE AND NOW LET THE PLAGUE COME IF IT MUST--HE WAS DONE WITH PREVENTIVES
YOU CAN'T MEAN TO SAY MY FATHER AWAY BACK YONDER YEARS AGO BOUGHT IT FOR A BLESSING FOR HIS CHILDREN AND INDEED HE DID
I HAVE TO SIT ON THE BED POOR THING POOR THING
HARRY HAD A WAY OF CASUALLY MENTIONING WESTERN INVESTMENTS THROUGH LINES THE FREIGHTING BUSINESS AND THE ROUTE THROUGH THE INDIAN TERRITORY TO LOWER CALIFORNIA WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO GIVE AN IMPORTANCE TO HIS LIGHTEST WORD
AND THERE WERE TEARS IN HER EYES THAT CONTRADICTED THE HARDNESS OF HER LANGUAGE YOU MIGHT NOT PITY HIM IF YOU KNEW MY HISTORY
THAT MAN'S TALENT FOR ORGANIZATION IS SOMETHING MARVELOUS
HE WISHED TO EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF THE MEASURE AND THUS JUSTIFY THE COMMITTEE'S ACTION
HE'S GOT THE CHEEK FOR IT HE HAS THE GRAVE AND THOUGHTFUL MANNER OF EXPECTORATION OF A PUBLIC MAN FOR ONE THING ADDED PHILIP
DUSENHEIMER STANDING IN THE DOOR OF HIS UNINVITING GROGGERY WHEN THE TRAINS STOPPED FOR WATER
WHEN ONE HAS BROKEN THE TENTH COMMANDMENT THE OTHERS ARE NOT OF MUCH ACCOUNT
WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN IT TURNED ALL THE BROAD RIVER TO A NATIONAL BANNER LAID IN GLEAMING BARS OF GOLD AND PURPLE AND CRIMSON
THE MORE HE SAW OF HIS CHIEF THE SENATOR THE MORE HE HONORED HIM AND THE MORE CONSPICUOUSLY THE MORAL GRANDEUR OF HIS CHARACTER APPEARED TO STAND OUT
INDEED HIS ANNOYANCE HAD TIME TO AUGMENT A GOOD DEAL
RUTH HAD AN IDEA THAT A LARGE PORTION OF THE WORLD LIVED BY GETTING THE REST OF THE WORLD INTO SCHEMES
THEN SHE CONTINUED:--"HE SAID I COULD BE USEFUL IN THE GREAT CAUSE OF PHILANTHROPY AND HELP IN THE BLESSED WORK OF UPLIFTING THE POOR AND THE IGNORANT IF HE FOUND IT FEASIBLE TO TAKE HOLD OF OUR LAND
IT'S A STEADFAST LITTLE SOUL
I'LL PUT YOU IN A WAY TO MAKE MORE MONEY THAT YOU'LL EVER KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
BUT HE HAD NOT HAD COURAGE ENOUGH TO PUT IT INTO WORDS
BUT YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IS TALKED ABOUT MORE OR LESS IN WASHINGTON
THE TIMBER IS WORTH MORE THAN THE MORTGAGE
IT SEEMED THAT AFTER THE DEPOSITION WAS TAKEN AS REPORTED THE COLONEL WAS TOLD FOR THE FIRST TIME BY HIS PHYSICIANS THAT HIS WOUNDS WERE MORTAL
THEY PET ME AND SPOIL ME EVEN MORE THAN THE OTHERS DO I THINK
THAT IS TO SUPPOSE THIS STUPENDOUS GAME LOST FOREVER THAT I HAVE PLAYED SO DESPERATELY FOR
LAURA'S SCORN WAS BOUNDLESS
THIS COSY LITTLE HOUSE BUILT ENTIRELY OF GLASS AND COMMANDING A MARVELOUS PROSPECT IN EVERY DIRECTION WAS A MAGICIAN'S THRONE TO THEM AND THEIR ENJOYMENT OF THE PLACE WAS SIMPLY BOUNDLESS
HE TOLD PHILIP THAT OF COURSE HE HAD GOT THROUGH WITH SUCH A WOMAN BUT HE WANTED TO SEE HER
WE HAVE NO NEED TO HEAR THE REST OF HIS EVIDENCE THE CHAIRMAN SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER AND MORE REGULAR TO PROCEED WITH THE INVESTIGATION ACCORDING TO THE USUAL FORMS
I MUST TELL--PUT--IT--DOWN--I--WRONGED--HER
COAL EXISTED IN ENORMOUS QUANTITY AND NO DOUBT OIL
AND HE SAID KEEP YOURSELF INFORMED OF POOR WASHINGTON'S CONDITION AND MOVEMENTS AND HELP HIM ALONG ALL YOU CAN CLAY THE YOUNGER CHILDREN ALSO SEEMED RELIEVED OF ALL FEARS AND DISTRESSES AND VERY READY AND WILLING TO LOOK TO CLAY FOR A LIVELIHOOD
HIS WIFE--SHE WAS NOT HIS WIFE EXCEPT BY THE LAW
BOSWELL BUT IT ALMOST APPEARED THAT HE WAS INDEBTED TO COL
PROBABLY NOT
HAS THREE OR FOUR CHILDREN ONE OF THEM A BABY
THE REPORTERS TOOK THEIR PLACES AND WERE ALL ATTENTION
THOUGHT A FEW MOMENTS THEN GLANCED AROUND LOOKED FRIGHTENED SPRANG TO THE DOOR TOO LATE--TOO LATE
SHE DID TRY TO BRIBE ME
HOW IS SHE NOW A HUNDRED AND NINETY-SIX AND STILL A-SWELLING!--WATER BELOW THE MIDDLE GAUGE-COCKS!--CARRYING EVERY POUND SHE CAN STAND!--NIGGER ROOSTING ON THE SAFETY-VALVE GOOD
BUT STILL ALL THE TRADITIONS OF ROMANCE POINTED TO THE MAKING THE ATTEMPT AS THE USUAL AND NECESSARY COURSE TO FOLLOW
ABSORB THOSE
SELBY LAURA'S FACE FLUSHED WITH ANGER OR SHAME
WHERE COAL IS LIMESTONE WITH THESE FOSSILS IN IT IS PRETTY CERTAIN TO LIE AGAINST ITS FOOT CASING
WHY DID YOU GET THE SPEECH WRITTEN FOR YOU AND THEN READ IT IN THE HOUSE WITHOUT EVER HAVING IT COPIED MR TROLLOP DID NOT LAUGH THIS TIME
IT MUST HAVE WORN A DIFFERENT ASPECT TO RUTH FOR SHE ENTERED INTO ITS PLEASURES AT FIRST WITH CURIOSITY AND THEN WITH INTEREST AND FINALLY WITH A KIND OF STAID ABANDON THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE DEEMED POSSIBLE FOR HER
I DESERVE IT
PHILIP COULD NOT BE SPARED FROM HER SIDE AND MR BOLTON HAD GONE UP TO ILIUM TO LOOK INTO THAT WONDERFUL COAL MINE AND TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR DEVELOPING IT AND BRINGING ITS WEALTH TO MARKET
GIT DOWN ON YO KNEES IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO SAY IT TWICE
PERHAPS I SHALL BE THE STAY OF THE FAMILY YET SAID RUTH WITH AN APPROACH TO GAIETY
THE STEP WAS A LONG ONE BETWEEN THE CARS AND THERE WAS NO PROTECTING GRATING
ISN'T THIS JOLLY CRIED HENRY DANCING OUT OF THE BARBER'S ROOM AND COMING DOWN THE DECK WITH A ONE TWO THREE STEP SHAVEN CURLED AND PERFUMED AFTER HIS USUAL EXQUISITE FASHION
SHE THEREFORE PERSUADED A FELLOW STUDENT WHO WAS READING THAT EVENING WITH HER TO GO DOWN TO THE DISSECTING ROOM OF THE COLLEGE AND ASCERTAIN WHAT THEY WANTED TO KNOW BY AN HOUR'S WORK THERE
ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FROM TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY HE SAID TO HIMSELF
SHE WAS STUNG TO THE QUICK BY THE COMMENTS OF THE NEWSPAPERS
YES YES THE SOUTHERN IS FAIR
HE HAD RECOVERED HIS HEAD NOW
IT IS TRUE WE ARE NOT RICH--BUT STILL YOU ARE NOT SORRY---YOU HAVEN'T ANY MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE ADDITIONS NO
I PULLED IT THROUGH COLONEL BUT IT WAS A TOUGH JOB THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT
YES--WHERE AM I
DID SHE THINK RUTH CARED FOR HIM
THE CHAIRMAN SAID LET THE PERSON PROCEED WITH HIS STATEMENT--THE COMMITTEE COULD EXCLUDE EVIDENCE THAT DID NOT BEAR UPON THE CASE
WE ARE SORRY WE CANNOT MAKE HER A FAULTLESS HEROINE
I WAS MARRIED AND AND YOUR WIFE STILL LIVES ASKED LAURA BENDING A LITTLE FORWARD IN HER EAGERNESS
FOR HARRY THOUGHT HIMSELF A MAN OF THE WORLD
GOOD HEAVENS AND EARTH EXCLAIMED THE COLONEL
A GENTLEMAN SIR
SHE SHUT HER EYES TO EVERYTHING BUT HER SENSE OF POSSESSION OF HER IDOL
THE CHILDREN ARE NOT FIT TO BE SEEN THEIR CLOTHES ARE IN SUCH A STATE
THERE WERE PARTIES HERE AND THERE TO WHICH THE FRIENDS OF RUTH AND THE MONTAGUES WERE OF COURSE INVITED AND HARRY IN THE GENEROSITY OF HIS NATURE GAVE IN RETURN A LITTLE SUPPER AT THE HOTEL VERY SIMPLE INDEED WITH DANCING IN THE HALL AND SOME REFRESHMENTS PASSED ROUND
MR DILWORTHY TOOK AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY TO SEND FOR MR NOBLE
SO I STICKS TO EM
THE TRAVELERS SCARCELY HAD TIME INDEED TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO THE SPLENDORS OF THE GREAT SALOON WHERE THE TABLES WERE SPREAD FOR MEALS A MARVEL OF PAINT AND GILDING ITS CEILING HUNG WITH FANCIFULLY CUT TISSUE-PAPER OF MANY COLORS FESTOONED AND ARRANGED IN ENDLESS PATTERNS
SHE WAS DONE WITH IT FOR ALL TIME
IN REPLY AN HONORABLE SENATOR SAID THAT HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AS WELL TO DROP THE MATTER AND ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT
THE FLOODING GASLIGHT FROM THE FANCIFULLY WROUGHT ROOF POURED DOWN UPON THE TRANQUIL SCENE
AND WITH THE RETURN COMPLIMENT THAT A RAIL ROAD WAS A GOOD THING AND THAT JEFF THOMPSON WAS NO SLOUCH
I DON'T SEE ANY HOPE
HE ESCORTED THE BAND FROM THE CITY HOTEL TO GEN
RECESSES WERE MOVED PLAINTIVELY BY THE OPPOSITION AND INVARIABLY VOTED DOWN BY THE UNIVERSITY ARMY
GIVE EM A SMALL INTEREST
NOW I DON'T THINK THERE HAS EVER BEEN ANYTHING IN MY CONDUCT THAT SHOULD MAKE YOU FEEL JUSTIFIED IN SAYING A THING LIKE THAT HE TURNED THEN AND WALKED SLOWLY OUT LEAVING WASHINGTON ABASHED AND SOMEWHAT BEWILDERED
UNDER THE GUISE OF APPOINTING A COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THE LATE MR DILWORTHY THE SENATE YESTERDAY APPOINTED A COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE HIS ACCUSER MR NOBLE
IF SENATOR DILWORTHY REMONSTRATED ABOUT APPEARANCES SHE HAD A WAY OF SILENCING HIM
NEARER AND NEARER THE THING CAME TILL ITS LONG SIDES BEGAN TO GLOW WITH SPOTS OF LIGHT WHICH MIRRORED THEMSELVES IN THE RIVER AND ATTENDED THE MONSTER LIKE A TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION
THE SQUIRE PRESSED THE VISITORS TO LET HIM SEND FOR THEIR TRUNKS AND URGED THEM TO STAY AT HIS HOUSE AND ALICE JOINED IN THE INVITATION BUT PHILIP HAD REASONS FOR DECLINING
BERIAH SELLERS CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES SIR
BUT MR SMALL SPOKE WITH A FALTERING VOICE OF HIS FAMILY HIS DAUGHTER IN SCHOOL HIS WIFE IGNORANT OF HIS CALAMITY AND DREW SUCH A PICTURE OF THEIR AGONY THAT MR BOLTON PUT BY HIS OWN MORE PRESSING NECESSITY AND DEVOTED THE DAY TO SCRAPING TOGETHER HERE AND THERE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THIS BRAZEN BEGGAR WHO HAD NEVER KEPT A PROMISE TO HIM NOR PAID A DEBT
IT IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE ANYWAY
YOU WAIT--YOU'LL SEE LAURA WISHED IN HER HEART THAT THE PROPHECY MIGHT COME TRUE
IT WAS ONLY WHEN SHE PASSED THROUGH THE WARD TO WHICH SHE WAS CONSIGNED AND SAW THE HORRIBLE CREATURES THE VICTIMS OF A DOUBLE CALAMITY WHOSE DREADFUL FACES SHE WAS HEREAFTER TO SEE DAILY AND WAS LOCKED INTO THE SMALL BARE ROOM THAT WAS TO BE HER HOME THAT ALL HER FORTITUDE FORSOOK HER
MAJOR SELLERS WHAT IS YOUR OCCUPATION THE COLONEL LOOKED ABOUT HIM LOFTILY AS IF CASTING IN HIS MIND WHAT WOULD BE THE PROPER OCCUPATION OF A PERSON OF SUCH MULTIFARIOUS INTERESTS AND THEN SAID WITH DIGNITY
GRANT THAT IT DOES GOOD
HERE NOW--THE SOAP WILL DO FOR BABYLON
THEY'RE NOT WARMED UP YET
THE YOUNGER CHILDREN WERE BORN AND EDUCATED DEPENDENTS
N THERE'S MASSACHUSETTS IT'S NOT FAR OFF I'VE HEERN MASSACHUSETTS WAS A-----OF A PLACE
HE WAS SURE OF THAT
AND MINE TOO I SUPPOSE
I WOULDN'T TAKE A QUARTER OF A MILLION FOR WHAT I CAN DO IN THIS PRESENT SESSION--NO INDEED I WOULDN'T
SPRING BLOSSOMED SUMMER CAME DRAGGED ITS HOT WEEKS BY AND THE COLONEL'S SPIRITS ROSE DAY BY DAY FOR THE RAILROAD WAS MAKING GOOD PROGRESS
HE WAS STRUGGLING IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF COMING DEATH
SUPPOSE HE VOTED NO
WAS INTRODUCED TO MR DILWORTHY
SHE SENT HIM A NOTE AND ASKED HIM TO CALL IN THE EVENING--WHICH HE DID
ISN'T THAT SO YES
GOOD-BYE--AND MIND WHAT I SAY
WHENEVER HE HEARD OF AN INSTANCE OF THIS KIND HE WOULD KEEP THAT PARTICULAR REMARK IN MIND AND ANALYZE IT AT HOME IN PRIVATE
I DOTE ON PARIS
THANK GOD LAURA SHE SAID IT IS OVER
PHILIP COME OUT HERE SHOUTED YOUNG ELI THROWING THE DOOR WIDE OPEN
IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR THE LENDER TO MAKE NO MEMORANDUM OF THE TRANSACTION
WE'LL GET YOU THE BEST COUNSEL THE LAWYERS IN NEW YORK CAN DO ANYTHING
BERIAH SELLERS WAS THE NEXT WITNESS CALLED
OH THE WORLD IS SO BRIGHT NOW AND SO CHEERY
AND HE ONLY FELT UNCERTAIN OF IT WHEN SHE WAS IN ONE OF HER MOODS OF RAILLERY WITH MOCKING MISCHIEF IN HER EYES
THE COLONEL WAS A HANDSOME MAN ABOUT FORTY A GENTLEMAN OF WEALTH AND HIGH SOCIAL POSITION A RESIDENT OF NEW ORLEANS
YOU POOR MOTHERLESS BOY AND LET ME TAKE YOUR GRIEF AND HELP YOU CARRY IT WHEN THE CHILD AWOKE IN THE MORNING IT WAS AS IF FROM A TROUBLED DREAM

I BELIEVE I HAVE FOUND OUT THE STUFF THAT WILL DO IT BUT IT KILLS THE HEN
HEAH I IS LORD HEAH I IS
ALWAYS A FOOL
AND IN THE LATE WAR WE SAW THE MOST DELICATE WOMEN WHO COULD NOT AT HOME ENDURE THE SIGHT OF BLOOD BECOME SO USED TO SCENES OF CARNAGE THAT THEY WALKED THE HOSPITALS AND THE MARGINS OF BATTLE-FIELDS AMID THE POOR REMNANTS OF TORN HUMANITY WITH AS PERFECT SELF-POSSESSION AS IF THEY WERE STROLLING IN A FLOWER GARDEN
BUT WHEN SHE FOUND THAT FRANCOIS WAS NOT IN IMMEDIATE DANGER SHE RALLIED AND BY NIGHT SHE WAS ABLE TO TAKE A WATCH HERSELF
FURTHER PARTICULARS WITH FULL BIOGRAPHIES OF ALL THE PARTIES IN OUR NEXT EDITION
IT WAS ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST OF THE MANY CHARMING SUBURBAN HOUSES IN THAT HOSPITABLE CITY WHICH IS TERRITORIALLY ONE OF THE LARGEST CITIES IN THE WORLD AND ONLY PREVENTED FROM BECOMING THE CONVENIENT METROPOLIS OF THE COUNTRY BY THE INTRUSIVE STRIP OF CAMDEN AND AMBOY SAND WHICH SHUTS IT OFF FROM THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
SHE HAD IN HER KEEPING A GREAT MANY SECRETS AND A GREAT MANY REPUTATIONS PERHAPS
CURIOUS THOSE NAMES HAVE ESCAPED ME
THEY WERE MAKING WHAT IS CALLED A PRELIMINARY SURVEY AND THE CHIEF OBJECT OF A PRELIMINARY SURVEY WAS TO GET UP AN EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE ROAD TO INTEREST EVERY TOWN IN THAT PART OF THE STATE IN IT UNDER THE BELIEF THAT THE ROAD WOULD RUN THROUGH IT AND TO GET THE AID OF EVERY PLANTER UPON THE PROSPECT THAT A STATION WOULD BE ON HIS LAND
TAKE CELERY NOW--THERE'S ONLY ONE SPOT IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE CELERY WILL GROW
THE SCENE WAS DRAMATICALLY WORKED UP IN COLUMN AFTER COLUMN
HE WAS STUDIOUSLY POLITE TO HER AND TREATED HER WITH A CONSIDERATION TO WHICH SHE WAS UNACCUSTOMED
BUT PERHAPS THE LOSSES ON HIS BOOKS WILL TURN OUT TO BE CREDITS IN A WORLD WHERE ACCOUNTS ARE KEPT ON A DIFFERENT BASIS
SHE SHAPED HER COURSE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE DAY THAT THAT HINT REACHED HER
WELL NOW SINCE YOU CORNER ME I WOULD TAKE IT,--BUT I WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT STEALING
ONLY HALF AN HOUR
YOU SUBSCRIBED FOR 100 SHARES OF THE CAPITAL STOCK AT $1,000 A SHARE I BELIEVE YES SIR I DID AND MR SELLERS TOOK A LIKE AMOUNT YES SIR VERY WELL
HIS LEDGER TAKE-IT-ALTOGETHER WOULD NOT SHOW A BALANCE ON THE RIGHT SIDE
SO FAR AS MR BRAHAM KNEW ONLY TWO COULD READ ONE OF WHOM WAS THE FOREMAN MR BRAHAM'S FRIEND THE SHOWY CONTRACTOR
AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL SHE REACHED THE POSTSCRIPT THAT SHE DISCOVERED THE CAUSE OF THE EXHILARATION
BLESS YOUR HEART THEY WILL GO BEFORE JUDGE AFTER JUDGE AND EXHORT AND BESEECH AND PRAY AND SHED TEARS
IT WAS HARD TO COME DOWN TO HUMDRUM ORDINARY LIFE AGAIN AFTER BEING A GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT AND THE MOST CONSPICUOUS MAN IN THE COMMUNITY
FIFTY LEFT IT IS ENOUGH TO GET ME HOME SHALL I DO IT OR SHALL I NOT
IF YOU SHOULD REAR A DUCK IN THE HEART OF THE SAHARA NO DOUBT IT WOULD SWIM IF YOU BROUGHT IT TO THE NILE
THAT IS THE PATH OF WICKEDNESS THOUGH SOME CALL IT THE ROAD TO HEAVEN THOMAS THE RHYMER
BUT YOU WILL MINGLE WITH OUR PEOPLE AND YOU WILL SEE HERE DEVELOPMENTS THAT WILL SURPRISE YOU THE COLONEL WAS SO PROFUSE IN HIS HOSPITALITY THAT HE MUST HAVE MADE THE IMPRESSION UPON HIMSELF THAT HE HAD ENTERTAINED THE SENATOR AT HIS OWN MANSION DURING HIS STAY
THERE'S A STEAMBOAT JUST COMING ROUND THE BEND AND JEFF ROARED WITH LAUGHTER
THIS MORNING AT ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK A LADY ACCOMPANIED BY A GENTLEMAN CALLED AT THE OFFICE OF THE HOTEL AND ASKED FOR COL
AND HE COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT HE WAS SO OFTEN DULL WITH RUTH WITH WHOM OF ALL PERSONS IN THE WORLD HE WANTED TO APPEAR AT HIS BEST
MY GOD THEY WILL HANG HER
WHY YES MISS OF COURSE IN A GREAT ENTERPRISE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY THERE WILL LITTLE THINGS OCCUR WHICH WHICH--AND OF COURSE THE POOR OUGHT TO BE LOOKED TO
FOR AS HIS WEALTH AND POPULARITY AUGMENTED THAT TITLE BY IMPERCEPTIBLE STAGES GREW UP INTO JUDGE INDEED IT BADE FAIR TO SWELL INTO GENERAL BYE AND BYE
HE SAID WITH COLD DIGNITY THAT COOK BOOKS WERE SOMEWHAT OUT OF THEIR LINE BUT HE WOULD ORDER IT IF SHE DESIRED IT
HE COULD DEAL WITH THOSE MILLIONS VIRTUOUSLY AND WITHAL WITH ABILITY TOO--BUT OF COURSE YOU WOULD RATHER HE HAD A SALARIED POSITION OH NO SAID THE GENTLEMAN FACETIOUSLY WE ARE VERY HUMBLE VERY HUMBLE IN OUR DESIRES
FOR TRIFLER AND VISIONARY AS HE WAS HARRY DESERVED A BETTER FATE THAN THIS
IT SPEEDILY TAKES SIDES FOR OR AGAINST THE ACCUSED AND RECOGNIZES AS QUICKLY ITS FAVORITES AMONG THE LAWYERS
CONTRACT SO MUCH COST OF WORK AND MATERIALS SO MUCH PROFITS SO MUCH
GEORGE TAPPED THE BIG BELL THREE TIMES TWO LEADSMEN SPRANG TO THEIR POSTS AND IN A MOMENT THEIR WEIRD CRIES ROSE ON THE NIGHT AIR AND WERE CAUGHT UP AND REPEATED BY TWO MEN ON THE UPPER DECK
HE SAID HE TOLD DILWORTHY THAT $5,000 WAS NOT MUCH TO PAY FOR A MAN'S HONOR CHARACTER AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS WORTH HAVING
OH I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL THEY WOULD HANG ME INSTEAD ARRIVED AT HOME WASHINGTON FELL INTO A CHAIR AND BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS AND GAVE FULL WAY TO HIS MISERY
SOMETIMES JURORS ARE UNACCOUNTABLY SWAYED BE AS CAREFUL AS YOU CAN IN CHOOSING THEM
BUT WE MUST HUMBLY BEAR IT BEAR IT REPLIED LAURA SCORNFULLY I'VE ALL MY LIFE BORNE IT AND FATE HAS THWARTED ME AT EVERY STEP A SERVANT CAME TO THE DOOR TO SAY THAT THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN BELOW WHO WISHED TO SPEAK WITH MISS HAWKINS
HE ENDED BY SAYING THAT THE VERDICT MUST BE ACQUITTAL OR MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE
CONGRESS HAD ONLY JUST ASSEMBLED AND DELAYS WERE TO BE FEARED
PHILIP WAS ON THE STRETCH OF HOPE AND EXCITEMENT
WE CAN JUST BARELY RUB THROUGH IF WE HIT IT EXACTLY RIGHT
HE WAS AT HARDING DURING THE TIME OF HER LIVING THERE WITH HIM
HE THEN TOUCHED REVERENTLY UPON THE INSTITUTIONS OF RELIGION AND UPON THE NECESSITY OF PRIVATE PURITY IF WE WERE TO HAVE ANY PUBLIC MORALITY
THEY EVEN TRIED TO BUY HIS VOTE
SHE SAYS THAT SEEMS LIKE HEAVEN MR BOLTON SAT BY RUTH'S BEDSIDE AND HE ROSE AND SILENTLY PRESSED PHILIP'S HAND
AND TO STRANGERS TOO
THE SENATOR WIPED HIS MOUTH WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF ADJUSTED HIS WHITE CRAVAT AND SAID THAT BUT FOR THE FACT THAT PUBLIC MORALITY REQUIRED AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WARNING OF FUTURE NOBLES HE WOULD BEG THAT IN CHRISTIAN CHARITY THIS POOR MISGUIDED CREATURE MIGHT BE FORGIVEN AND SET FREE
NOW DO I LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO----DOES MY HISTORY SUGGEST THAT I AM A MAN WHO DEALS IN TRIFLES CONTENTS HIMSELF WITH THE NARROW HORIZON THAT HEMS IN THE COMMON HERD SEES NO FURTHER THAN THE END OF HIS NOSE
THE CAUSES OF THIS MOMENTARY POSSESSION COULD OFTEN BE FOUND IN THE PERSON'S LIFE
HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY BUSY WITH THOSE THINGS WHEN HE WAS NOT AT THE BEDSIDE OF HIS SICK ACQUAINTANCE OR ARRANGING THE DETAILS OF HIS SPECULATION WITH COL
DURING HIS FIRST WEEKS OF PAIN AND WEAKNESS RUTH WAS UNCEASING IN HER MINISTRATIONS
SHE COULD NOT EXPECT HIM TO PUT HIMSELF TO SO MUCH TROUBLE FOR HER AND PAY HIS FARE BESIDES
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SHOOTS HER ABSCONDING LOVER IN COLD-BLOOD
SENATOR
THE WHOLE BODY OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE DEFENSE WAS SHOWN TO BE IRRELEVANT INTRODUCED ONLY TO EXCITE SYMPATHY AND NOT GIVING A COLOR OF PROBABILITY TO THE ABSURD SUPPOSITION OF INSANITY
YES THERE IS TALK ALWAYS WILL BE ABOUT A PRETTY WOMAN SO MUCH IN PUBLIC AS SHE IS
YOU WILL FIND EVERY DOOR OPEN AND A WELCOME AT EVERY HEARTHSTONE
OH IT IS ALL OVER--IT IS ALL OVER FOR GOOD COLONEL
HER NAME WILL BE IN EVERY ONE'S MOUTH MORE THAN EVER AND HOW THEY WILL COURT HER AND QUOTE HER BRIGHT SPEECHES
THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF HER GAIETY AND HER MERRY LAUGH AND THE CHILDREN WISHED THAT RUTH WOULD NEVER GO AWAY AGAIN
ROARED OUT GET OFF THIS TRAIN I SHALL NOT GET OFF
PERHAPS SOME OF THESE STUDENTS LOOKED FORWARD TO THE NEAR DAY WHEN THEY WOULD SUPPORT SUCH A PRACTICE AND A HUSBAND BESIDES BUT IT IS UNKNOWN THAT ANY OF THEM EVER WENT FURTHER THAN PRACTICE IN HOSPITALS AND IN THEIR OWN NURSERIES AND IT IS FEARED THAT SOME OF THEM WERE QUITE AS READY AS THEIR SISTERS IN EMERGENCIES TO CALL A MAN IF RUTH HAD ANY EXAGGERATED EXPECTATIONS OF A PROFESSIONAL LIFE SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF AND WAS KNOWN TO HER FELLOWS OF THE CLASS SIMPLY AS A CHEERFUL SINCERE STUDENT EAGER IN HER INVESTIGATIONS AND NEVER IMPATIENT AT ANYTHING EXCEPT AN INSINUATION THAT WOMEN HAD NOT AS MUCH MENTAL CAPACITY FOR SCIENCE AS MEN
DURING A WEEK OR TWO WASHINGTON DROVE ABOUT THE CITY EVERY DAY WITH HER AND FAMILIARIZED HER WITH ALL OF ITS SALIENT FEATURES
IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE
THEE KNOWS WE WERE NEVER HAPPIER THAN WHEN WE WERE IN A MUCH HUMBLER HOME THE TRUTH IS MARGARET THAT AFFAIR OF BIGLER AND SMALL'S HAS COME ON ME JUST WHEN I COULDN'T STAND ANOTHER OUNCE
BY AND BY HE BECAME A LARGE CONTRACTOR FOR CITY WORK AND WAS A BOSOM FRIEND OF THE GREAT AND GOOD WM
AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONLY ETERNAL HOPE SPRINGING IN THE BREAST THAT KEPT ALIVE NUMEROUS OLD CLAIMANTS WHO FOR YEARS AND YEARS HAD BESIEGED THE DOORS OF CONGRESS AND WHO LOOKED AS IF THEY NEEDED NOT SO MUCH AN APPROPRIATION OF MONEY AS SIX FEET OF GROUND
THEN GET THE TOWNS ON THE LINE TO ISSUE THEIR BONDS FOR STOCK AND SELL THEIR BONDS FOR ENOUGH TO COMPLETE THE ROAD AND PARTLY STOCK IT ESPECIALLY IF WE MORTGAGE EACH SECTION AS WE COMPLETE IT
NOW BE GOOD AND YOU SHALL HAVE THE MISSING PAGE OF YOUR GREAT SPEECH
HARRY WAS ENTIRELY HAPPY
THE NOISE OF A BUSY CITY BEGAN TO FILL THE AIR;--AND WITH A SLOWER AND SLOWER CLANK ON THE CONNECTING RAILS AND INTERLACING SWITCHES THE TRAIN ROLLED INTO THE STATION AND STOOD STILL
WASHINGTON WAS PAST ALL HOPE OF CHEER NOW
RUTH WAS NEVER MORE CERTAIN THAT SHE WAS RIGHT AND THAT SHE WAS SUFFICIENT UNTO HERSELF
ONE OF THESE DAYS I'LL HAVE ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH EXPECTO BUT BERIAH DEAR DON'T INTERRUPT ME
BESIDES EVERY ALTERNATE SECTION OF LAND ON THIS LINE
I WANT MR TROLLOP TO MAKE HIS GREAT SPEECH ON THE PENSION BILL DO YOU
HER MOTHER APPEARED LIKE ONE SHAKEN WITH AN AGUE FIT
AFTER COL
DO YOU WANT TO CARRY WATER IN IT
LATELY HIS CASE HAS DEVELOPED A SOMETHING WHICH IS A WONDER TO THE HIRED NURSES BUT WHICH WILL NOT BE MUCH OF A MARVEL TO YOU IF YOU HAVE READ MEDICAL PHILOSOPHY MUCH
PHILIP ALSO WROTE TO RUTH
SHE HAD WILL AND PRIDE AND COURAGE AND AMBITION AND SHE WAS LEFT TO BE VERY MUCH HER OWN GUIDE AT THE AGE WHEN ROMANCE COMES TO THE AID OF PASSION AND WHEN THE AWAKENING POWERS OF HER VIGOROUS MIND HAD LITTLE OBJECT ON WHICH TO DISCIPLINE THEMSELVES
BUT SHE WAS IMPATIENT AND WISHED SHE WERE A MAN TO TAKE HOLD OF THE BUSINESS
HE WROTE TO HER FROM HARDING A SMALL TOWN IN THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE STATE SAYING THAT HE SHOULD BE HELD IN THE SERVICE LONGER THAN HE HAD EXPECTED BUT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE MORE THAN A FEW MONTHS THEN HE SHOULD BE AT LIBERTY TO TAKE HER TO CHICAGO WHERE HE HAD PROPERTY AND SHOULD HAVE BUSINESS EITHER NOW OR AS SOON AS THE WAR WAS OVER WHICH HE THOUGHT COULD NOT LAST LONG
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND A PLEASANTER TRAVELING PARTY ONE THAT SHOOK OFF MORE READILY THE ARTIFICIAL RESTRAINTS OF PURITANIC STRICTNESS AND TOOK THE WORLD WITH GOOD-NATURED ALLOWANCE
OH I WISH I COULD GO INTO EITHER OF THOSE SPECULATIONS--I ONLY WISH I HAD MONEY--I WISH I WASN'T CRAMPED AND KEPT DOWN AND FETTERED WITH POVERTY AND SUCH PRODIGIOUS CHANCES LYING RIGHT HERE IN SIGHT
I GUESS OUR NEXT BEST DODGE WAS SENDING A PLEASURE TRIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTERS OUT TO NAPOLEON
WHILE MEN WITH AXES WORKED WITH MIGHT AND MAIN TO FREE THESE POOR FELLOWS THE BOREAS'S BOATS WENT ABOUT PICKING UP STRAGGLERS FROM THE RIVER
NOW SHE KNEW HE WAS A COLD-BLOODED SCOUNDREL WITHOUT PITY
IT'S ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF THIS TALK TALK TALK
IT WAS BAD
THAT IT HAD BEEN LONG PREMEDITATED AND THREATENED
THEREFORE HE SOLD OUT AT A SACRIFICE THAT LEFT HIM CONSIDERABLY REDUCED IN WORLDLY POSSESSIONS AND BEGAN HIS VOYAGE TO SAN FRANCISCO
DON'T YOU FIND IT VERY WARM TO-DAY MR HAWKINS SAID BLANCHE BY WAY OF A REMARK
HE APPEARED TO TAUNT HER WITH HER DISHONOR HE THREATENED EXPOSURE IF SHE DID NOT BECOME AGAIN THE MISTRESS OF HIS PASSION
SELLERS AND HAD BEEN DISCOURAGED TO NOTE THAT THE COLONEL'S BILL OF FARE WAS FALLING OFF BOTH IN QUANTITY AND QUALITY--A SIGN HE FEARED THAT THE LACKING INGREDIENT IN THE EYE-WATER STILL REMAINED UNDISCOVERED--THOUGH SELLERS ALWAYS EXPLAINED THAT THESE CHANGES IN THE FAMILY DIET HAD BEEN ORDERED BY THE DOCTOR OR SUGGESTED BY SOME NEW SCIENTIFIC WORK THE COLONEL HAD STUMBLED UPON
YES HERE'S HIS CARD--LOUISIANA LAURA TOOK THE CARD LOOKED AT IT INTENTLY TILL SHE WAS SURE OF THE ADDRESS AND THEN LAID IT DOWN WITH NO HE IS NO FRIEND OF OURS THAT AFTERNOON LAURA WROTE AND DISPATCHED THE FOLLOWING NOTE
MR BOLTON FELT MORE COURAGE THAN HE HAD HAD IN MONTHS AT THE SIGHT OF HIS MANLY FACE AND THE SOUND OF HIS CHEERY VOICE
THE HIATUS WAS PLEASANTER TO THE HOUSE AND THE GALLERIES THAN IT WAS TO ME
AND IT ACTUALLY HELPED HIM FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS
SHE FELT THAT SHE SOON SHOULD BE AMONG THESE LOATHSOME CREATURES
THE GREAT PUBLIC ALWAYS TURNS AROUND AND WEEPS FOR AN ODIOUS MURDERER AND PRAYS FOR HIM AND CARRIES FLOWERS TO HIS PRISON AND BESIEGES THE GOVERNOR WITH APPEALS TO HIS CLEMENCY AS SOON AS THE PAPERS BEGIN TO HOWL FOR THAT MAN'S BLOOD.--IN A WORD THE GREAT PUTTY-HEARTED PUBLIC LOVES TO GUSH AND THERE IS NO SUCH DARLING OPPORTUNITY TO GUSH AS A CASE OF PERSECUTION AFFORDS WELL UNCLE DEAR
SHE WOULD ARRAY HERSELF IN FINE ATTIRE SHE WOULD ADORN HERSELF WITH JEWELS AND STAND IN HER ISOLATED MAGNIFICENCE BEFORE MASSED AUDIENCES AND ENCHANT THEM WITH HER ELOQUENCE AND AMAZE THEM WITH HER UNAPPROACHABLE BEAUTY
BELIEVED IN HANGIN FOR THEM THAT DESERVED IT
I SAW THROUGH THE PRETTY SCHEME IN A SECOND
AND THERE ISN'T ANY COMPLIMENT YOU CAN PAY ME EQUAL TO DOING A THING LIKE THIS AND FINISHING IT UP JUST TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT I'LL BE WILLING TO IT
WIFE--CHILDREN--COME NEARER--NEARER
NO THE PUBLIC READ FROM TIME TO TIME OF THE LOVELY PRISONER LANGUISHING IN THE CITY PRISON THE TORTURED VICTIM OF THE LAW'S DELAY
HE DWELT UPON THE ADMISSION OF BASE WRONG IN COL
UPON THE TABLE WAS THE USUAL SERVICE THE HEAVY MUCH NICKED STONE WARE THE ROW OF PLATED AND RUSTY CASTORS THE SUGAR BOWLS WITH THE ZINC TEA-SPOONS STICKING UP IN THEM THE PILES OF YELLOW BISCUITS THE DISCOURAGED-LOOKING PLATES OF BUTTER
MR BRAHAM PRESERVED HIS SERENE CONFIDENCE BUT LAURA'S FRIENDS WERE DISPIRITED
WHEN I OVERHEARD THAT CONVERSATION I TOOK AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY TO ASK MR BUCKSTONE IF HE KNEW OF ANYBODY WHO MIGHT WANT A SPEECH WRITTEN--I HAD A FRIEND AND SO FORTH AND SO ON
THESE LATTER INSTANTLY ROUSED UP YAWNED AND BEGAN TO LOOK ALERT
SHE WAS GAZING OUT OVER THE TRACKLESS EXPANSES OF THE FUTURE NOW WITH TROUBLED EYES
DON'T YOU LET HER SEE YOU ARE SELFISH ABOUT IT IS MY ADVICE THE LAST EVENING THEY WERE TO SPEND IN FALLKILL THEY WERE AT THE MONTAGUES AND PHILIP HOPED THAT HE WOULD FIND RUTH IN A DIFFERENT MOOD
COULDN'T YOU WRITE AND ASK THEM COULDN'T YOU WASHINGTON--SEEING IT'S YOU THAT WANTS THE RIDE
WHY PHIL SHE WOULD SAY WHAT PUTS YOU IN THE DUMPS TO DAY
COME COME LITTLE CHAP YOU MUSTN'T BE GOING TO SLEEP BEFORE SUNDOWN WITH A TIRED EXPRESSION THE SMALL FACE CAME UP OUT OF THE HANDS,--A FACE DOWN WHICH TEARS WERE FLOWING
SHE WAS MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER--AND GEORGE'S TOO
SELLERS PROFUSELY APOLOGIZING AND CLAIMING THE RIGHT NEXT TIME NEXT TIME AS SOON AS BERIAH SELLERS HAD BADE HIS FRIENDS GOOD NIGHT AND SEEN THEM DEPART HE DID NOT RETIRE APARTMENTS IN THE PLANTER'S BUT TOOK HIS WAY TO HIS LODGINGS WITH A FRIEND IN A DISTANT PART OF THE CITY
LORD BLESS ME
THIS SORT OF THING WANTS AN OLD QUIET STEADY HAND--WANTS AN OLD COOL HEAD YOU KNOW THAT KNOWS MEN THROUGH AND THROUGH AND IS USED TO LARGE OPERATIONS
HE MIGHT PERHAPS SEE BRIERLY IN THE MORNING
SHE HAD MORE THAN HER RIGHTFUL SHARE OF PRACTICAL GOOD SENSE BUT STILL SHE WAS HUMAN
WHATEVER THE LAGGING DRAGGING JOURNEY MAY HAVE BEEN TO THE REST OF THE EMIGRANTS IT WAS A WONDER AND DELIGHT TO THE CHILDREN A WORLD OF ENCHANTMENT
SIS HAS SEEN HER MOST A HUNDRED TIMES
IF THE LADY RECEIVING THE CALL DESIRES A FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE SHE MUST RETURN THE VISIT WITHIN TWO WEEKS
THINGS HAVE BEEN GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY
THEIR CARDS PRESERVE THE INTIMACY AND KEEP THE ACQUAINTANCESHIP INTACT
YOU SEE SHE REPLIED
PERHAPS NOT ALWAYS SAID PHILIP I MIGHT GO AND PRACTICE IN BOSTON MAYBE OR GO TO CHICAGO OR YOU MIGHT GET ELECTED TO CONGRESS PHILIP LOOKED AT ALICE TO SEE IF SHE WAS IN EARNEST AND NOT CHAFFING HIM
THEY WERE HANDSOME ENOUGH FELLOWS THAT WAS EVIDENT BROWNED BY OUT-DOOR EXPOSURE AND WITH A FREE AND LORDLY WAY ABOUT THEM THAT ALMOST AWED THE HOTEL CLERK HIMSELF
IF HE HAD KEPT OUT OF SUGAR AND GONE BACK HOME CONTENT TO STICK TO MULES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HAPPY WISDOM
BUT IT TRANSPIRED THAT MRS HAWKINS HAD NEVER KNOWN OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN HER HUSBAND AND MAJOR LACKLAND
BUT THE JURY HAD A QUESTION
I SEE THAT HE IS A VICTIM OF THAT EVIL WHICH IS SWALLOWING UP PUBLIC VIRTUE AND SAPPING THE FOUNDATION OF SOCIETY
YOU ARE NOT A FOOL MR TROLLOP MISS HAWKING YOU FLATTER ME
HE NEVER WILL COMEBACK
THERE WAS NOTHING THAT JEFF WOULDN'T DO TO ACCOMMODATE A FRIEND FROM SHARING HIS LAST DOLLAR WITH HIM TO WINGING HIM IN A DUEL
SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A WOMAN AND DID NOT KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE BUSINESS PROSPERITY OF THE WORLD IS ONLY A BUBBLE OF CREDIT AND SPECULATION ONE SCHEME HELPING TO FLOAT ANOTHER WHICH IS NO BETTER THAN IT AND THE WHOLE LIABLE TO COME TO NAUGHT AND CONFUSION AS SOON AS THE BUSY BRAIN THAT CONCEIVED THEM CEASES ITS POWER TO DEVISE OR WHEN SOME ACCIDENT PRODUCES A SUDDEN PANIC
THE SENATOR LOOKED AT HIS COMPANION SCRUTINIZINGLY FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF HE MEANT ANYTHING PERSONAL AND THEN REPLIED UNDOUBTEDLY UNDOUBTEDLY
WASHINGTON'S DELIGHT IN HIS BEAUTIFUL SISTER WAS MEASURELESS
WORK OUT YOUR FREEDOM
NOBLE STILL DECLINED TO VOTE AND SAID HE DID NOT BELIEVE DILWORTHY WAS GOING TO BE ELECTED
SHE'LL KNOW FIVE HUNDRED OF THE HEAVIEST GUNS IN THE TOWN BEFORE THIS NIGHT'S NONSENSE IS OVER
ALL THE WAY HOME HE NURSED HIS WOE AND EXALTED IT
WE LEARN THAT THE MURDERESS WHO IS A WOMAN OF DAZZLING AND TRANSCENDENT BEAUTY AND ABOUT TWENTY SIX OR SEVEN IS A NIECE OF SENATOR DILWORTHY AT WHOSE HOUSE SHE HAS BEEN SPENDING THE WINTER
I NEVER DID THINK HE WAS RIGHT WELL BALANCED
A MADE MAN FOR ALL TIME AND ETERNITY
SIX OR EIGHT MIDDLE-AGED COUNTRY PEOPLE OF BOTH SEXES WERE GROUPED ABOUT AN OBJECT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
THERE--THERE
BUT HE IS AGAINST US AND IS OUR BITTEREST OPPONENT
SEE HIS FINE EYES VERY
ONE OF THOSE LOOSE-JOINTED CAPABLE FELLOWS WHO SAUNTER INTO THE WORLD WITH A FREE AIR AND USUALLY MAKE A STIR IN WHATEVER COMPANY THEY ENTER
I'LL BET IT'S FORTY FEET THICK
IT WAS LIKE ASKING CHILDREN TO REPUDIATE THEIR OWN FATHER
THE GREAT CONTRACTORS HAD CONCLUDED THEIR BUSINESS WITH THE STATE AND RAILROAD OFFICIALS AND WITH THE LESSER CONTRACTORS AND DEPARTED FOR THE EAST

SELLERS CAME DOWN THE STREET ON A RUN AND ARRIVED PANTING FOR BREATH
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING I OWN SOME TERRIERS SIR OWN SOME TERRIERS EH
SHE SIGNIFIES HER WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE IT BY CALLING AGAIN ANY TIME WITHIN TWELVE-MONTHS
WITHOUT THE THRONG OCCUPIED ALL THE SEATS THE WINDOW LEDGES AND THE STANDING ROOM
YOU MEAN AN EXAMPLE WELL IT'S ALL THE SAME
THE WORLD WAS FULL OF SUNSHINE AND HER HEART WAS FULL OF MUSIC
FAILS
AT FIRST HE COULD NOT SEE THAT THE REMARK WAS ANYTHING BETTER THAN A PARROT MIGHT ORIGINATE
I HAVE NOT SEEN THE BILL ITSELF BUT FROM WHAT I CAN HEAR IT--IT--WELL IT HAS A BAD LOOK ABOUT IT
WHERE COULD THEY HAVE GONE
THE CHILD'S MANNERS WERE THOSE OF A LITTLE LADY AND HER CLOTHES WERE DAINTIER AND FINER THAN ANY MRS HAWKINS HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE
AUTHORITY SEEMED TO INVEST HIM WITH A NEW SPLENDOR
THERE IS NO DISPLAY OF HUMAN INGENUITY WIT AND POWER SO FASCINATING AS THAT MADE BY TRAINED LAWYERS IN THE TRIAL OF AN IMPORTANT CASE NOWHERE ELSE IS EXHIBITED SUCH SUBTLETY ACUMEN ADDRESS ELOQUENCE
BUT LORD BLESS ME I GO IN FOR HAVING THE BEST OF A THING EVEN IF IT DOES COST A LITTLE MORE--IT'S THE BEST ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
HE RECEIVED NO SALARY AS PRIVATE SECRETARY BUT THESE TWO CLERKSHIPS PROCURED BY HIS BENEFACTOR PAID HIM AN AGGREGATE OF TWELVE DOLLARS A DAY WITHOUT COUNTING THE TWENTY PERCENT EXTRA COMPENSATION WHICH WOULD OF COURSE BE VOTED TO HIM ON THE LAST NIGHT OF THE SESSION
AT THE SAME TIME MY CONSCIENCE WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO PLEASE ALTER THE FIGURES I NAMED TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IF YOU WILL AND LET THE PROPOSITION GO TO THE COMPANY--I WILL STICK TO IT IF IT BREAKS MY HEART THE STRANGER LOOKED AMUSED AND THERE WAS A PRETTY WELL DEFINED TOUCH OF SURPRISE IN HIS EXPRESSION TOO BUT HAWKINS NEVER NOTICED IT
BECAUSE SHE DESIRED TO BELIEVE IT
HIS WIFE WAS THERE CONSTRUCTING SOME DRIED APPLE PIES
THEN LONG ROCK CUTTINGS DEVOTED TO THE ADVERTISEMENTS OF PATENT MEDICINES AND READY-MADE CLOTHING AND NEW YORK TONICS FOR JERSEY AGUES AND JERSEY CITY IS REACHED
HAWKINS ENJOYED THE ADMIRATION THESE PRODIGIES COMPELLED BUT HE ALWAYS SMILED TO THINK HOW POOR AND CHEAP THEY WERE COMPARED TO WHAT THE HAWKINS MANSION WOULD DISPLAY IN A FUTURE DAY AFTER THE TENNESSEE LAND SHOULD HAVE BORNE ITS MINTED FRUIT
WE MUST CREATE A PUBLIC OPINION SAID SENATOR DILWORTHY
I HAVE MET YOU ON BUSINESS THREE OR FOUR TIMES
MEANTIME WHY SHOULD THEY BE SEPARATED
ONE MIGHT AS WELL SET THE GENTLEMEN DETAINED IN THE PUBLIC PRISONS TO TRYING EACH OTHER
HE ONLY THOUGHT OF THE DELICIOUS WORDS HE HAD HEARD
TAKE A SEAT--TAKE A SEAT THANK YOU SIR SAID HARRY THROWING AS MUCH CHILL INTO HIS MANNER AS HIS RUFFLED DIGNITY PROMPTED
SELLERS TOWARD THE END OF NOVEMBER
IT BEING PLAIN THAT SENATOR DILWORTHY'S STATEMENT WAS RIGIDLY TRUE AND THIS FACT BEING STRENGTHENED BY HIS ADDING TO IT THE SUPPORT OF HIS HONOR AS A SENATOR THE COMMITTEE RENDERED A VERDICT OF NOT PROVEN THAT A BRIBE HAD BEEN OFFERED AND ACCEPTED THIS IN A MANNER EXONERATED NOBLE AND LET HIM ESCAPE
IT SEEMED TWENTY HOURS
HOWEVER THEY MAY HAVE THOUGHT THAT TO SIT AT HOME AND GRUMBLE WOULD SOME DAY RIGHT THE EVIL
SHE REACHED THE ANTE-ROOM THREW OFF HER WRAPS AND PLACED HERSELF BEFORE THE DRESSING-GLASS
I AM SO MISERABLE THESE DAYS THE COLONEL MADE WASHINGTON GET UP AND WALK THE FLOOR WITH HIM ARM IN ARM
A SUDDEN CALL UPON MR BOLTON FOR A LARGE SUM OF MONEY WHICH MUST BE FORTHCOMING AT ONCE HAD FOUND HIM IN THE MIDST OF A DOZEN VENTURES FROM NO ONE OF WHICH A DOLLAR COULD BE REALIZED
HERE'S THE RICH PERU
BY AND BY THEY WENT DOWN STAIRS AND SAT BY THE FIRE AND TALKED LONG AND EARNESTLY ABOUT LAURA'S HISTORY AND THE LETTERS
I ALWAYS HAD A LEANING TO THE STUDY
BUT PHILIP WAS EXULTANT
WE MUST BEG OUR BREAD NOW
EVERY TIME THE COLONEL CAME INTO THE REAL ESTATE OFFICE WASHINGTON'S HEART BOUNDED AND HIS EYES LIGHTED WITH HOPE BUT IT ALWAYS TURNED OUT THAT THE COLONEL WAS MERELY ON THE SCENT OF SOME VAST UNDEFINED LANDED SPECULATION--ALTHOUGH HE WAS CUSTOMARILY ABLE TO SAY THAT HE WAS NEARER TO THE ALL-NECESSARY INGREDIENT THAN EVER AND COULD ALMOST NAME THE HOUR WHEN SUCCESS WOULD DAWN
I WAS AT HIS LODGINGS IN GEORGETOWN A DAY OR TWO AGO WITH COL
13;--AND THEN THERE'S 11
HE'S A KIND OF EH
BUT I CANNOT GO BACK A BOY BROUGHT IN A TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCH
PERHAPS IT WAS HIS ENTRANCE
IT'S A LONG TIME THOUGH SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN HERE TO SAY SO ALICE SAID WITH HER FATHER'S FRANKNESS OF MANNER
I NEVER PUSH A PRIVATE INTEREST IF IT IS NOT JUSTIFIED AND ENNOBLED BY SOME LARGER PUBLIC GOOD
LET US JOIN IN PRAYER WHEN SENATOR DILWORTHY DEPARTED FROM CATTLEVILLE HE LEFT THREE DOZEN BOYS BEHIND HIM ARRANGING A CAMPAIGN OF LIFE WHOSE OBJECTIVE POINT WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATE
R
R
I TOLD THEM NO NO SPECULATION FOR ME
THENCE TO TO--THAT QUILL--CATFISH--HAND ME THE PINCUSHION MARIE ANTOINETTE
THERE WAS A NOTE SAYING THAT ENCLOSED HE WOULD PLEASE FIND A BILL FOR THE CURRENT YEAR'S TAXES ON THE 75,000 ACRES OF TENNESSEE LAND BELONGING TO THE ESTATE OF SILAS HAWKINS DECEASED AND ADDED THAT THE MONEY MUST BE PAID WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OR THE LAND WOULD BE SOLD AT PUBLIC AUCTION FOR THE TAXES AS PROVIDED BY LAW
THAT'S MY WAY
AND IF THAT SHOULD LEAVE HER NOW THERE WILL BE NO HOPE
DO YOU SUPPOSE HE WAS EVER APPROACHED ON THE SUBJECT PERHAPS NOT IF YOU HAD APPROACHED HIM FOR INSTANCE FORTIFIED WITH THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE BEST MEN IN CONGRESS AND THE PUREST ETC ETC
BLESS YOU HE'LL BE BACK FAST ENOUGH TO-MORROW NEVER NEVER NEVER
IF IT CAME TO CHOICE--AND IT MIGHT COME TO THAT SOONER OR LATER--SHE BELIEVED SHE COULD COME TO A DECISION WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY OR MANY PANGS
LAURA AFTER HER LAST CONVERSATION WITH HARRY HAD A NEW SENSE OF HER POSITION
TELL ME MY DEAR MISS HAWKINS SH
LAURA WAS A LITTLE THING THEN
AN ABSENCE OF ANY WHAT-POTS IN THE CORNERS WITH ROWS OF CHEERFUL SHELLS AND HINDOO GODS AND CHINESE IDOLS AND NESTS OF USELESS BOXES OF LACQUERED WOOD MIGHT BE TAKEN AS DENOTING A LANGUIDNESS IN THE FAMILY CONCERNING FOREIGN MISSIONS BUT PERHAPS UNJUSTLY
GIVE THEM MONEY TO FIGHT WITH AND THE GHOST OF AN EXCUSE AND THEY
AFTER A BRIEF COMPARISON OF NOTES THE CONGRESSMEN SOUGHT THEIR SEATS AND SENT PAGES ABOUT THE HOUSE WITH MESSAGES TO FRIENDS
WHY THIS IS THE SENATOR WHO FRANKED HIS BAGGAGE HOME THROUGH THE MAILS LAST WEEK--REGISTERED AT THAT
BUT I WISH THE NEW YORK PAPERS WOULD TALK A LITTLE PLAINER
JUST PUT HER EAR TO--THE--KEYHOLE OF THE BACK PARLOR-DOOR
I DON'T LIKE THIS SORT OF THING
WE WILL FIND A HIGHER PLACE WHERE YOU CAN WALK WITH YOUR OWN KIND AND BE UNDERSTOOD WHEN YOU SPEAK--NOT STARED AT AS IF YOU WERE TALKING SOME FOREIGN TONGUE
OTHERWISE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED MUCH OF A RESULT FROM A MERE INITIAL APPROPRIATION LIKE THAT
MR TROLLOP WAS A BITTER ENEMY OF HER BILL
HE IS SPOKEN OF FOR THE POST OF MINISTER TO CHINA OR AUSTRIA AND I HOPE WILL BE APPOINTED
THE WHOLE FAMILY WERE POORLY AND CHEAPLY DRESSED
LAURA WAS PRESENTED AND THEN SHE PASSED ON INTO THE MAELSTROM OF BE-JEWELED AND RICHLY ATTIRED LOW-NECKED LADIES AND WHITE-KID-GLOVED AND STEEL PEN-COATED GENTLEMEN AND WHEREVER SHE MOVED SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY A BUZZ OF ADMIRATION THAT WAS GRATEFUL TO ALL HER SENSES--SO GRATEFUL INDEED THAT HER WHITE FACE WAS TINGED AND ITS BEAUTY HEIGHTENED BY A PERCEPTIBLE SUFFUSION OF COLOR
DILWORTHY SAID I WILL GIVE YOU $5,000 A COMMITTEE MAN SAID IMPATIENTLY THAT THIS STUFF WAS ALL OUTSIDE THE CASE AND VALUABLE TIME WAS BEING WASTED
HE MARSHALLED THE PROCESSION OF MASONS OF ODD FELLOWS AND OF FIREMEN THE GOOD TEMPLARS THE SONS OF TEMPERANCE THE CADETS OF TEMPERANCE THE DAUGHTERS OF REBECCA THE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN AND CITIZENS GENERALLY WHICH FOLLOWED THE SENATOR TO THE COURT HOUSE
SUCH A MAN MIGHT YEARS AGO NOT NOW HAVE CHANGED HER NATURE AND MADE THE ISSUE OF HER LIFE SO DIFFERENT EVEN AFTER HER CRUEL ABANDONMENT
I SUPPOSE IT'S SO WELL SENATOR BALLOON PUT FIFTEEN CENTS WORTH OF STAMPS ON EACH OF THOSE SEVEN HUGE BOXES OF OLD CLOTHES AND SHIPPED THAT TON OF SECOND-HAND RUBBISH OLD BOOTS AND PANTALOONS AND WHAT NOT THROUGH THE MAILS AS REGISTERED MATTER
THE EMACIATED FINGERS BEGAN TO PICK AT THE COVERLET A FATAL SIGN
IN WASHINGTON HE WAS AN IMPORTANT MAN CORRESPONDENT AND CLERK OF TWO HOUSE COMMITTEES A WORKER IN POLITICS AND A CONFIDENT CRITIC OF EVERY WOMAN AND EVERY MAN IN WASHINGTON
THEE MUSTN'T LOSE HEART PHILIP AND THEN SHE ADDED IN ANOTHER MOOD THEE KNOWS I GRADUATE IN THE SUMMER AND SHALL HAVE MY DIPLOMA
NOW HAWKINS THE PROCESSION'S READY
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU YOU KNOW MY BILL--THE KNOBS UNIVERSITY BILL AH I BELIEVE IT IS YOUR BILL
MAY BE HE WAS NOT THE MAN HE ONCE WAS
WHY WASHINGTON IN THE ORIENTAL COUNTRIES PEOPLE SWARM LIKE THE SANDS OF THE DESERT
IT WILL BE FOUND OUT
WHY SHOULD I WANT YOU TO GO AWAY
IT WAS DOUBTFUL IF ANY SACRIFICE COULD SAVE HIM FROM RUIN
PART 3
HARRY KNEW ALL ABOUT THE OPERA GREEN ROOM AND ALL AT LEAST HE SAID SO AND KNEW A GOOD MANY OF THE OPERAS AND COULD MAKE VERY ENTERTAINING STORIES OF THEIR PLOTS TELLING HOW THE SOPRANO CAME IN HERE AND THE BASSO HERE HUMMING THE BEGINNING OF THEIR AIRS--TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TI--SUGGESTING THE PROFOUND DISSATISFACTION OF THE BASSO RECITATIVE--DOWN-AMONG-THE-DEAD-MEN--AND TOUCHING OFF THE WHOLE WITH AN AIRY GRACE QUITE CAPTIVATING
BUT NOW IN HIS DELIRIUM IT ALL COMES OUT
AN A GOIN ON TURRIBLE--AN DO DE LORD CARRY ON DAT WAY DOUT DEY'S SUMFIN DON'T SUIT HIM
HE USED TO MAKE ME HIS CONFIDANT NOW AND THEN AND BE TERRIBLY IN THE DUMPS WHY DID HE COME TO YOU PURSUED RUTH YOU WERE YOUNGER THAN HE I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW
TO HER SIMPLE SCHOOL-GIRL DRESS SHE WAS BEGINNING TO ADD THOSE MYSTERIOUS LITTLE ADORNMENTS OF RIBBON-KNOTS AND EAR-RINGS WHICH WERE THE SUBJECT OF EARNEST CONSULTATIONS WITH HER GROWN FRIENDS
THEY WERE NEW AND WONDERFULLY SHINY AND THE BRASSES ON THE HARNESS WERE HIGHLY POLISHED AND BORE COMPLICATED MONOGRAMS
LET ME SEE--$9,640 FROM $20,000--SALARY $2,400 ADDED--AH YES THE BALANCE DUE THE COMPANY FROM YOURSELF AND MR SELLERS IS $7,960 WHICH I WILL TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALLOWING TO STAND FOR THE PRESENT UNLESS YOU PREFER TO DRAW A CHECK NOW AND THUS CONFOUND IT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT INSTEAD OF THE COMPANY OWING US $2,400 WE OWE THE COMPANY $7,960 WELL YES AND THAT WE OWE THE MEN AND THE CONTRACTORS NEARLY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS BESIDES OWE THEM
BY AND BY SHE SAID
NOBLE FURTHER SAID THAT THERE WERE FIFTY MEMBERS PRESENT WITH MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS PLACED THERE BY DILWORTHY TO BUY THEIR VOTES
THE PARTING BETWEEN LAURA AND HER MOTHER WAS EXCEEDINGLY PAINFUL TO BOTH
SELLERS AND TO SOUND HIM ABOUT THE WASHINGTON VISIT
AND IT NOT ONLY CRAWLED BUT IT FREQUENTLY STOPPED
DOES ALICE APPEAR TO BE PRESENT WHEN SHE IS ABSENT ALICE HAS SOME HUMAN FEELING ANYWAY
THE ONLY MEANS OF HEATING BEING FROM THE CORRIDOR WHEN THE DOOR WAS AJAR THE CELL WAS CHILLY AND AT THIS TIME DAMP
WHAT STEAM ARE YOU CARRYING A HUNDRED AND FORTY-TWO SIR
I'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING TO PASS AWAY THE TIME ON A LITTLE PREPARATION FOR CURING SORE EYES--A KIND OF DECOCTION NINE-TENTHS WATER AND THE OTHER TENTH DRUGS THAT DON'T COST MORE THAN A DOLLAR A BARREL
THERE CAN'T BE TWO WE GONE DIS TIME--WE DONE GONE DIS TIME SHO
AND WITH HER HEALTH CAME BACK HER BEAUTY AND AN ADDED FASCINATION A SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE MISTAKEN FOR SADNESS
I MAKE NO CHARGES BUT IF THIS WOMAN WAS IN HER RIGHT MIND WHEN SHE FLED FROM WASHINGTON AND REACHED THIS CITY IN COMPANY--WITH BRIERLY THEN I DO NOT KNOW WHAT INSANITY IS WHEN MR BRAHAM SAT DOWN HE FELT THAT HE HAD THE JURY WITH HIM
SHE HARDLY KNEW HERSELF SO WORN AND OLD SHE LOOKED AND SO MARRED WITH BLOOD WERE HER FEATURES
THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD
THESE GENTLEMEN AND THEIR HOUSEHOLDS WERE UNOSTENTATIOUS PEOPLE
HIS WIFE AUNT JINNY AGED 30 YOUNG MISS EMILY HAWKINS YOUNG MARS WASHINGTON HAWKINS AND YOUNG MARS CLAY THE NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY RANGED THEMSELVES ON A LOG AFTER SUPPER AND CONTEMPLATED THE MARVELOUS RIVER AND DISCUSSED IT
AT THE PRAYER MEETINGS THE SENATOR ALWAYS BROUGHT WASHINGTON UP THE AISLE ON HIS ARM AND SEATED HIM PROMINENTLY
THE WHOLE THING IS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO ME MISS HAWKINS BUT YOU APOLOGIZED
LAURA HAD BEEN A DIFFERENT WOMAN SINCE THEN
YOU SEE BY THE MAP
SELLERS KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HAWKEYE IN A PANIC HAD RUSHED TO THE FRONT AND SUBSCRIBED SUCH A SUM THAT NAPOLEON'S ATTRACTIONS SUDDENLY SANK INTO INSIGNIFICANCE AND THE RAILROAD CONCLUDED TO FOLLOW A COMPARATIVELY STRAIGHT COARSE INSTEAD OF GOING MILES OUT OF ITS WAY TO BUILD UP A METROPOLIS IN THE MUDDY DESERT OF STONE'S LANDING
AS FOR WASHINGTON HARRY THOUGHT HE WAS A MAN OF ABILITY AND COMPREHENSION BUT TOO VISIONARY HE TOLD THE COLONEL
WAS VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO ME WHEN TROLLOP'S BREAK-DOWN IN THE HOUSE SHOWED HIM THE OBJECT OF MY MYSTERIOUS SCHEME
OH MY DEAR SIR PRINTING BILLS ARE DESTRUCTION ITSELF
OPEN THE LETTER--OPEN IT QUICK AND LET'S KNOW ALL ABOUT IT BEFORE WE STIR OUT OF OUR PLACES
33--WELL NEVER MIND THE DETAILS THE TOTAL IN CLEAN NUMBERS FOOTS UP $118,254.42 THUS FAR WHAT OH YES INDEED
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JEFF
TO-MORROW
AN OLD LADY MOTIONED TOWARD THE DOOR AND SAID TO HAWKINS IN A WHISPER
HE LIKED TO BE CALLED UNCLE BY THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
RENOWNED GENERALS AND ADMIRALS WHO HAD SEEMED BUT COLOSSAL MYTHS WHEN HE WAS IN THE FAR WEST WENT IN AND OUT BEFORE HIM OR SAT AT THE SENATOR'S TABLE SOLIDIFIED INTO PALPABLE FLESH AND BLOOD
OUT OF A MEAGER SALARY HE SOON SAVED MONEY ENOUGH TO OPEN QUITE A STYLISH LIQUOR SALOON HIGHER UP TOWN WITH A FARO BANK ATTACHED AND PLENTY OF CAPITAL TO CONDUCT IT WITH
AND SHE WENT QUIETLY TO TAKE HER RESIDENCE IN TOWN AND BEGAN HER ATTENDANCE OF THE LECTURES AS IF IT WERE THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD
SHE ONLY WATCHED HIS MOVEMENTS DAY BY DAY AND ALWAYS HELD HERSELF READY TO ACT PROMPTLY
WELL PARTLY SIR PARTLY
MRS OREILLE BUT THE WEATHER'S BEEN SO HORRID
SINCE HE WAS WELL ENOUGH TO BE ABOUT THE HOUSE SHE WAS BUSY AGAIN WITH HER STUDIES
FOR WHILE EVERY VISIBLE SIGN ABOUT HIM PROCLAIMED HIM A POOR WITLESS USELESS WEAKLING THE TRUTH WAS THAT HE HAD THE BRAINS TO PLAN GREAT ENTERPRISES AND THE PLUCK TO CARRY THEM THROUGH
PRESENTLY WHILE SHE WAS HOLDING A COPY OF VENETIAN LIFE IN HER HAND AND RUNNING OVER A FAMILIAR PASSAGE HERE AND THERE THE CLERK SAID BRISKLY SNATCHING UP A PAPER-COVERED VOLUME AND STRIKING THE COUNTER A SMART BLOW WITH IT TO DISLODGE THE DUST
WHEN THEY TRIED MR FAIROAKS AND A CLOUD OF WITNESSES PROVED HIM TO BE--WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THEY PROVED HIM TO BE--AND HIS OWN TESTIMONY AND HIS OWN CONFESSIONS GAVE HIM THE SAME CHARACTER WHAT DID CONGRESS DO THEN?--COME WELL WHAT DID CONGRESS DO YOU KNOW WHAT CONGRESS DID WASHINGTON
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING FOR YOU
HAD READ THE NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF THE CASE BUT THEY MADE NO IMPRESSION ON HIM
TURNIPS
NO A MAN WANTS RICHES IN HIS YOUTH WHEN THE WORLD IS FRESH TO HIM
THE SPARK OF TRUTH AND HONOR THAT WAS LEFT IN HER WAS ELICITED BY HIS PRESENCE
I WENT THERE HOPING SHE WOULD TRY TO BRIBE ME--GOOD SOLID CAPITAL THAT WOULD BE IN THE EXPOSURE
SHOULD WE LEAVE THEM WITHOUT TOOLS
THEN WE WENT DOWN ON IT A LITTLE
THE ENTHUSIASM FADED AWAY FROM HIS EYES AND THE LOOK OF A MAN WHO IS THINKING TOOK ITS PLACE
SIT DOWN AND LET US TALK AND BE FRIENDLY THE GENTLEMAN WAVERED
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED A DRAWING ROOM WITH MORE SELF-POISE NOR A CHURCH WITH MORE HAUGHTY HUMILITY
CHAPTER LXII
AND I HAVE COME SQUARE OUT WITH THEIR OFFER WITHOUT THROWING OUT ANY FEELERS--AND I DID IT IN THE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD REFUSE
MOTHER THEE DOES NOT KNOW HOW DIFFERENT IT IS IN FALLKILL HOW MUCH MORE INTERESTING THE PEOPLE ARE ONE MEETS HOW MUCH MORE LIFE THERE IS BUT THEE WILL FIND THE WORLD CHILD PRETTY MUCH ALL THE SAME WHEN THEE KNOWS IT BETTER
SHE HAD JUST REACHED THE ROMANTIC AGE--THE AGE WHEN THERE IS A SAD SWEETNESS A DISMAL COMFORT TO A GIRL TO FIND OUT THAT THERE IS A MYSTERY CONNECTED WITH HER BIRTH WHICH NO OTHER PIECE OF GOOD LUCK CAN AFFORD
AS I WAS SAYING WHEN I CAN LAY DOWN THE CARES OF OFFICE AND RETIRE TO THE SWEETS OF PRIVATE LIFE IN SOME SUCH SWEET PEACEFUL INTELLIGENT WIDE-AWAKE AND PATRIOTIC PLACE AS HAWKEYE APPLAUSE I HAVE TRAVELED MUCH I HAVE SEEN ALL PARTS OF OUR GLORIOUS UNION BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A LOVELIER VILLAGE THAN YOURS OR ONE THAT HAS MORE SIGNS OF COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL AND RELIGIOUS PROSPERITY--(MORE APPLAUSE THE SENATOR THEN LAUNCHED INTO A SKETCH OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY AND DWELT FOR AN HOUR OR MORE UPON ITS PROSPERITY AND THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED IT
KING HENRY IV
WHAT SECURITY WOULD ONE HAVE FOR IT MR BIGLER SMILED A HARD KIND OF SMILE AND SAID YOU'D BE INSIDE MR BOLTON AND YOU'D HAVE THE FIRST CHANCE IN THE DEAL THIS WAS RATHER UNINTELLIGIBLE TO RUTH WHO WAS NEVERTHELESS SOMEWHAT AMUSED BY THE STUDY OF A TYPE OF CHARACTER SHE HAD SEEN BEFORE
THE REASON NOVELISTS NEARLY ALWAYS FAIL IN DEPICTING WOMEN WHEN THEY MAKE THEM ACT IS THAT THEY LET THEM DO WHAT THEY HAVE OBSERVED SOME WOMAN HAS DONE AT SOMETIME OR ANOTHER
AND PROMISED THE STATISTICS FOR NEXT DAY
THAT REMINDS ME
CLUSTERED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WERE TEN OR TWELVE MORE CABINS SOME NEW SOME OLD
CHAPTER VII
NOTHING CAN EVER MAKE US UNHAPPY ANY MORE
NO NEW YORK YAS I'VE HEERN O NEW YORK CONTINUED THE BUTTERNUT LAD ATTENTIVELY STUDYING EACH ITEM OF HARRY'S DRESS AND ENDEAVORING TO COVER HIS DESIGN WITH INTERESTING CONVERSATION
WHEN NEXT LAURA WAS ALONE SHE FELL INTO A TRAIN OF THOUGHT SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HE ALWAYS YOU HAVE NOTICED TALKS WITH ONE EYE ON THE GALLERY WHILE THE OTHER IS ON THE SPEAKER WELL MY HUSBAND SAYS ITS NONSENSE TO TALK OF WAR AND WICKED
COULD PHIL LET HIM HAVE A HUNDRED SAY FOR NINETY DAYS
THESE WORMS HERE HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT--AND WHEN THEY DO THEY'LL NOT BELIEVE IN IT
TOMORROW OUR OWN WIVES MIGHT BE WIDOWS THEIR OWN CHILDREN ORPHANS LIKE THE BEREAVED FAMILY IN YONDER HOTEL DEPRIVED OF HUSBAND AND FATHER BY THE JEALOUS HAND OF SOME MURDEROUS FEMALE
NONE WORE MOUSTACHES
HER MIND WAS FILLED WITH MORE IMPORTANT THOUGHTS
YOU KNOW IT IS THE HANDWRITING
ONE WAS THAT HE DISCOVERED TO HIS CONFUSION AND SHAME THAT IN ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE HELPED A SECOND TIME TO THE TURNIPS HE HAD ROBBED THOSE HUNGRY CHILDREN
AND IF ONE MAY JUDGE BY WHAT SHE HEARS THERE ARE CHANCES THERE FOR A FOR A FASCINATING WOMAN SHE WAS GOING TO SAY PERHAPS BUT SHE DID NOT
AND THUS ANCHORED THEY PROCEEDED TO LOOK AND ENJOY
HE DIDN'T REGRET STRIKING THE FELLOW--HE HOPED HE HAD LEFT A MARK ON HIM
SHE WOULD KILL ME IF SHE COULD THOUGHT THE COLONEL
NOW INSTEAD OF REQUIRING YOU TO FORWARD THIS AGGREGATE OF $16,000 OR $17,000 TO NEW YORK THE COMPANY VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO LET YOU PAY IT OVER TO THE CONTRACTORS LABORERS FROM TIME TO TIME AND GIVE YOU CREDIT ON THE BOOKS FOR IT
SHE WAS PROUD AND SHE FELT THE STING OF POVERTY
A NOISY AND RATHER ILL-NATURED DEBATE FOLLOWED NOW AND LASTED HOUR AFTER HOUR
I DON'T CARE FOR MYSELF BUT FOR THEE AND THE CHILDREN THAT WILL BE THE LEAST OF MISFORTUNES SAID MRS BOLTON CHEERFULLY IF THEE CAN CLEAR THYSELF FROM DEBT AND ANXIETY WHICH IS WEARING THEE OUT WE CAN LIVE ANY WHERE
HOWEVER LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SELLERS FAMILY COOLED DOWN AND CRYSTALIZED INTO SHAPE AND THE POOR ROOM LOST ITS GLITTER AND RESUMED ITS POVERTY
THE ACCOUNTS IN THE EVENING PAPERS WERE ONLY THE PREMONITORY DROPS TO THIS MIGHTY SHOWER
DO YOU KNOW WHO THOSE INITIALS REPRESENT--AND ARE THEY FORGERIES HARRY WAS STUPEFIED
SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS SO ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THE NEW YORK PAPERS WOULD SAY ABOUT THE BILL THAT HE HAD ARRANGED TO HAVE SYNOPSES OF THEIR EDITORIALS TELEGRAPHED TO HIM
WASHINGTON WAS INTRODUCED TO MRS BOSWELL AND HIS IMAGINATION WAS ON THE POINT OF FLITTING INTO THE VAPORY REALMS OF SPECULATION AGAIN WHEN A LOVELY GIRL OF SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN CAME IN
NOW HERE IS A WITNESS WHO HAS KNOWN THE PRISONER FROM INFANCY AND IS COMPETENT TO TESTIFY UPON THE ONE POINT VITAL TO HER SAFETY
THEY COULD GO TO EUROPE--ANYWHERE
LAURA'S LIFE WAS RUSHING ON NOW IN THE FULL STREAM OF INTRIGUE AND FASHIONABLE DISSIPATION
WHEN WE MOVE INTO A LITTLE HOUSE IN TOWN WILL THEE LET ME PUT A LITTLE SIGN ON THE DOOR
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO RUN DOWN AND SEE THEM BUT I'M INTO SO MANY OPERATIONS AND THEY'RE NOT THINGS A MAN FEELS LIKE TRUSTING TO OTHER PEOPLE AND SO SOMEHOW WE KEEP PUTTING IT OFF
NO FATHER NO MOTHER NO KIN FOLKS OF NO KIND
BUT HE'S A GOOD FELLOW AND YOU CAN TELL HIM THAT SELLERS WON'T GO BACK ON HIM BY THE WAY ASKED HARRY WHO IS THAT RATHER HANDSOME PARTY THAT'S HANGING ROUND LAURA
SHE TOOK COMFORTING NOTE OF THE FACT THAT THESE GUESTS DIRECTED A VERY LIBERAL SHARE OF THEIR CONVERSATION TOWARD HER
SO YOU OBSERVE THAT YOU TAKE YOUR VIEW FROM THE BACK OF THE CAPITOL
AND THEN THERE IS THE HOG SPECULATION--THAT'S BIGGER STILL
WELL THIS POOR LITTLE BOY WAS ALWAYS IN HIS PLACE WHEN THE BELL RANG AND HE ALWAYS KNEW HIS LESSON
THE HOUR CAME FOR THE PRESIDENT'S RECEPTION
RUN ALONG CHILDREN RUN ALONG
HE TALKED WITH THE LANDLORD TOO ABOUT ENLARGING HIS HOTEL AND ABOUT BUYING SOME VILLAGE LOTS IN THE PROSPECT OF A RISE WHEN THE MINE WAS OPENED
HE SAW THE BILL GO INTO COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE AND STRUGGLE FOR ITS LIFE AGAIN AND FINALLY WORRY THROUGH
THE BLACK FACE SEEMED TO DEFY THE PALLOR OF DEATH AND ASSERTED AN UGLY LIFE-LIKENESS THAT WAS FRIGHTFUL
PHILIP STERLING USED TO SAY THAT IF HE SHOULD SERIOUSLY SET HIMSELF FOR TEN YEARS TO ANY ONE OF THE DOZEN PROJECTS THAT WERE IN HIS BRAIN HE FELT THAT HE COULD BE A RICH MAN
I WANT TO SHAKE YOU BY THE HAND
THE WHISTLING OF THE STEAM WAS SOMETHING FRIGHTFUL NOW--IT ALMOST DROWNED ALL OTHER NOISES
SO THAT A FINISHED EDUCATION CONSISTED SIMPLY OF A PERMANENT HEADACHE AND THE ABILITY TO READ WITHOUT STOPPING TO SPELL THE WORDS OR TAKE BREATH
BUT NOW THE KEEPERS OF THE HOUSE HAD BECOME UNEASY
SHE CONSIDERED HERSELF A SUPERIOR CONVERSATIONIST
CLAY REMAINED AT HOME SEVERAL DAYS
WHY NANCY YOU--YOU CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING BELIEVE IT INDEED
THE SPEAKER LEFT HIS PLACE OF COURSE AND A CHAIRMAN WAS APPOINTED
AND WHEN HE TURNED AWAY SHE FOLLOWED HIM WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT HAVE DISTURBED HIS SERENITY IF HE HAD NOT AT THE MOMENT HAD A LITTLE SQUARE LETTER IN HIS BREAST POCKET DATED AT PHILADELPHIA AND SIGNED RUTH CHAPTER XX
HE IS ONE OF MY FRIENDS LAURA
AND PERHAPS THE MODERN LAIS WOULD NEVER HAVE DEPARTED FROM THE NATIONAL CAPITAL IF THERE HAD BEEN THERE EVEN ONE REPUBLICAN XENOCRATES WHO RESISTED HER BLANDISHMENTS
COMING FROM THE EAST THEY WERE STRUCK WITH MANY PECULIARITIES
MEANTIME THE CLERK'S EYES WERE BUSY AND NO DOUBT HIS ADMIRATION WAS RETURNING AGAIN--OR MAY BE HE WAS ONLY GAUGING HER PROBABLE LITERARY TASTES BY SOME SAGACIOUS SYSTEM OF ADMEASUREMENT ONLY KNOWN TO HIS GUILD
WE HAVE JUDGE
NO THIS IS ONLY A SUBTERFUGE
IN BED HE PASSED AN HOUR THAT THREATENED TO TURN HIS HAIR GRAY AND THEN A BLESSED CALM SETTLED DOWN UPON HIM THAT FILLED HIS HEART WITH GRATITUDE
THE MAN WAS LAME IN ONE LEG AND APPEARED TO BE FLITTING FROM PLACE TO PLACE
THERE SIR I'M NOT OFFENDED
THERE WAS ONE WOMAN PHYSICIAN DRIVING ABOUT TOWN IN HER CARRIAGE ATTACKING THE MOST VIOLENT DISEASES IN ALL QUARTERS WITH PERSISTENT COURAGE LIKE A MODERN BELLONA IN HER WAR CHARIOT WHO WAS POPULARLY SUPPOSED TO GATHER IN FEES TO THE AMOUNT TEN TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
HE WAS RIGID UPON THAT
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE WELL THIS SHE MENTIONED THE NAMES OF SEVERAL PROMINENT CONGRESSMEN
WELL SIR SAID HARRY HESITATINGLY WE WERE FRIENDS YOU ACT LIKE A FRIEND SARCASTICALLY THE JURY WERE BEGINNING TO HATE THIS NEATLY DRESSED YOUNG SPRIG
NOW HOW DOES THAT STRIKE YOU WELL I AM ONLY AN AGENT OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE FRIENDS OF MINE AND I AM NOT EVEN PAID FOR MY SERVICES
THE BOREAS LANDED HER DREADFUL CARGO AT THE NEXT LARGE TOWN AND DELIVERED IT OVER TO A MULTITUDE OF EAGER HANDS AND WARM SOUTHERN HEARTS--A CARGO AMOUNTING BY THIS TIME TO 39 WOUNDED PERSONS AND 22 DEAD BODIES
HE TOO SINCERELY RESPECTED RUTH'S JUDGMENT TO MAKE ANY PROTEST HOWEVER AND HE WOULD HAVE DEFENDED HER COURSE AGAINST THE WORLD
ARTHUR IF YOU ARE FOND OF POETRY
HE WAS BORNE TO THE FAMILY SITTING ROOM IN TRIUMPH BY THE SWARM OF LITTLE SELLERSES THE PARENTS FOLLOWING WITH THEIR ARMS ABOUT EACH OTHER'S WAISTS
I DO HATE TO BE BEAT JIM SAID GEORGE LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD WATCHING THE SLIGHTEST YAWING OF THE BOAT AND PROMPTLY MEETING IT WITH THE WHEEL HOW'LL IT DO TO TRY MURDERER'S CHUTE WELL IT'S--IT'S TAKING CHANCES
IS IT NOT SO MAMMA QUITE SO MY CHILD
I VERY PARTICULARLY DESIRE IT OH IT IS EASY TO SAY MAKE HIM DO IT BUT HOW AM I TO MAKE HIM IT IS PERFECTLY EASY
THE AIR IS FULL OF SUCH CHANCES AND I KNOW OUR FAMILY WOULD CONSENT IN A MOMENT THAT I SHOULD PUT IN THEIR SHARES WITH MINE
HE SAID THE LAND WAS FOR THE CHILDREN--HE COULD NOT ROB THEM OF THEIR FUTURE MILLIONS FOR SO PALTRY A SUM
THE SECURITY IS IN MY HANDS BUT IT IS GOOD FOR NOTHING TO ME
SLOWLY PHILIP DREW HER BACK TO LIFE
GOOD GRACIOUS IT'S THE COUNTRY TO PILE UP WEALTH IN
DID YOU HEAR GRACE MR HAWKINS SAYS IT'S CONGENIAL WHEN IT'S NOT CONGEALED WHAT IS DEAR SAID GRACE WHO WAS TALKING WITH LAURA
IT JUST GROWS LIKE WEEDS
THEY WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE BEYOND REPROACH AND THAT WAS SUFFICIENT
IT PLEASED HIM TO SEE UPON THE ROLL THE NAMES OF MANY COLORED CITIZENS AND IT MUST REJOICE EVERY FRIEND OF HUMANITY TO KNOW THAT THIS LATELY EMANCIPATED RACE WERE INTELLIGENTLY TAKING PART IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESOURCES OF THEIR NATIVE LAND
IS ALWAYS SENDING ME SOME TRIFLE
GIVE TONE TO A MEASURE--SAY TEN OF THESE AT $3,000 EACH IS $30,000
THE COURT ROOM WAS CROWDED AT AN EARLY HOUR BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF JUDGES LAWYERS AND PRISONER
FOR A FEW MOMENTS ALL ORDER WAS LOST
I'VE GOT A LITTLE PROJECT THAT I'VE BEEN KEEPING
ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS HE SAID
THE COLONEL HAD ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN HARRY'S INFLUENCE WITH WALL STREET AND WITH CONGRESSMEN TO BRING ABOUT THE CONSUMMATION OF THEIR SCHEME AND HE WAITED HIS RETURN IN THE EMPTY HOUSE AT HAWKEYE FEEDING HIS PINCHED FAMILY UPON THE MOST GORGEOUS EXPECTATIONS WITH A RECKLESS PRODIGALITY
STILL PHILIP'S CONSCIENCE TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS HIS PLAIN DUTY TO CARRY THE MATTER INTO THE COURTS EVEN WITH THE CERTAINTY OF DEFEAT
OF COURSE THE PHYSICIANS WILL NOT LET ME TELL HIM NOW THAT OUR LAURA IS INDEED HIS CHILD--THAT MUST COME LATER WHEN HIS HEALTH IS THOROUGHLY RESTORED
AND THE PRESIDENT SHE ADDED THAT WITH TRANQUILITY
IT'S NOT MUCH OF A PLACE ILIUM PHILIP WENT ON AS IF A LITTLE GEOGRAPHICAL REMARK WOULD FIT IN HERE AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE AND I SHALL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO THINK OVER THE RESPONSIBILITY I HAVE TAKEN AND HIS OBSERVATION DID NOT SEEM TO BE COMING OUT ANY WHERE
IF I WERE SURE THAT YOU SHE THREW THE SPRAY AWAY AND CONTINUED
SHE WAS ACTING FOR ME
THEN SHE STRAIGHTENED UP FOLDED HER WHITE HANDS IN HER LAP AND BECAME A SPLENDID ICE-BERG
NEVERTHELESS THE HINT THAT HARRY HAD DROPPED FELL UPON GOOD GROUND AND BORE FRUIT AN HUNDRED FOLD
I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OUT SHE THEN WENT INTO THE DETAILS
HE RE-CLOTHED HIS FAMILY LAID IN A GOOD STOCK OF PROVISIONS AND STILL HAD MONEY LEFT
LATTERLY HE NEVER THOUGHT OF HER WITHOUT THINKING OF RUTH AND IF HE GAVE THE SUBJECT ANY ATTENTION IT WAS PROBABLY IN AN UNDEFINED CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE HAD HER SYMPATHY IN HIS LOVE AND THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT IT
SALARIES OF HOME OFFICERS ARE STILL GOING ON
THEY ARE GENTLE AND CONFIDING AND CHILDLIKE AND IN MY OPINION THESE ARE QUALITIES THAT ENNOBLE THEM FAR MORE THAN ANY AMOUNT OF SINFUL SAGACITY COULD
IT WAS A GENIAL SPRING DAY WHEN THEY LANDED AT ST LOUIS
IT WAS SAD TO SEE HIS NAME DISAPPEAR FROM THE NEWSPAPERS
SHE AT LEAST NEVER MOCKED HIM AND IT WAS A RELIEF TO TALK WITH ONE WHO HAD SOME SYMPATHY WITH HIM
LAURA WAS MORE IN THE SHADOW AND STOOD FOR AN INSTANT LONG ENOUGH FOR THE COLONEL TO MAKE THE INWARD OBSERVATION THAT SHE WAS A MAGNIFICENT WOMAN
IT IS CUSTOMARY TO HAND A LARGE SUM IN BANK BILLS TO A MAN YOU HAVE JUST BEEN INTRODUCED TO IF HE ASKS YOU TO DO IT TO BE CONVEYED TO A DISTANT TOWN AND DELIVERED TO ANOTHER PARTY
SHE DID NOT WANT TO BE THOUGHT OF SHE SAID AS GOING IN SEARCH OF A HUSBAND
TO THEM A UNITED STATES SENATOR WAS A VAST VAGUE COLOSSUS AN AWE INSPIRING UNREALITY
SELBY KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM
SELLERS NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE INTO THE COLUMBUS NAVIGATION SCHEME AND PROBABLY NEVER INTO THE EAST TENNESSEE LAND SCHEME AND HE WOULD NOT NOW BE DETAINED IN NEW YORK FROM VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS OPERATIONS ON THE PACIFIC COAST FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF GIVING EVIDENCE TO CONVICT OF MURDER THE ONLY WOMAN HE EVER LOVED HALF AS MUCH AS HE LOVES HIMSELF
THERE IS A DELICIOUS MOMENT OF EXCITEMENT WHICH THE FREQUENTER OF TRIALS WELL KNOWS AND WHICH HE WOULD NOT MISS FOR THE WORLD
AND HARRY WENT AWAY EXCITED AND A LITTLE HOPEFUL BUT ONLY A LITTLE
IT'S AN AWFUL DISTANCE--TEN OR TWELVE HUNDRED MILE THEY SAY BUT THEN IN A CASE OF THIS KIND--A BODY CAN'T STAND BACK FOR TROUBLE YOU KNOW MRS O.--"NO OF COURSE THAT'S OFF
YES--YES--I REMEMBER NOW
IT IS SAID THAT HE CLAIMS TO KNOW OF IMPROPER PRACTICES HAVING BEEN USED IN THE INTEREST OF THIS BILL AND HE THINKS HE SEES A CHANCE TO MAKE A GREAT SENSATION WHEN THE BILL COMES UP
CONSULTED THE MAPS WITH THE ENGINEERS AND WENT OVER THE PROFILES WITH THE CONTRACTORS FIGURING OUT ESTIMATES FOR BIDS
WHY WASHINGTON MY BOY THESE THINGS ARE NOTHING
I'VE HAD IT ON MY MIND SOMETIME
I HAVEN'T ANY MORE USE FOR IT SHE PICKED UP THE PAGE OF MANUSCRIPT BUT SHE RECONSIDERED HER INTENTION OF HANDING IT TO HIM AND SAID BUT NEVER MIND
BUT SHE FOUND HERSELF FALLING MORE AND MORE INTO REVERIES AND GROWING WEARY OF THINGS AS THEY WERE
AS SHE GREW OLDER SHE RATHER WONDERED THAT THEY WERE AS PROSPEROUS AS THEY SEEMED TO BE AND THAT THEY DID NOT ALL GO TO SMASH AMID SO MANY BRILLIANT PROJECTS
ARRIVED IN THE GALLERY OF THE SENATE THE FRIENDS SAW A CURIOUS SPECTACLE--EVERY SENATOR HELD AN EXTRA IN HIS HAND AND LOOKED AS INTERESTED AS IF IT CONTAINED NEWS OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE EARTH
YOU'LL SEE THE GENERAL'S OPINIONS QUOTED TOO--AND WHAT THE GENERAL HAS TO SAY ABOUT THE PROPRIETY OF A NEW TRIAL AND A HABEAS CORPUS FOR THE UNFORTUNATE MISS HAWKINS WILL NOT BE WITHOUT WEIGHT IN INFLUENTIAL QUARTERS I CAN TELL YOU AND I WANT TO BE THE FIRST TO SHAKE YOUR FAITHFUL OLD HAND AND SALUTE YOU WITH YOUR NEW HONORS AND I WANT TO DO IT NOW--GENERAL SAID WASHINGTON SUITING THE ACTION TO THE WORD AND ACCOMPANYING IT WITH ALL THE MEANING THAT A CORDIAL GRASP AND ELOQUENT EYES COULD GIVE IT
THEY WAS FROM AWAY NORTH SOMERS--SHE KEP SCHOOL WHEN SHE FUST COME
AND AS HE BETOOK HIM TO HIS BED HE SAID TO HIMSELF
NEVER HAD HEARD OF THE CASE
ITS CLIENTS THE SWARMING NATIONS THAT INHABIT IT
BUT LAURA WAS NOT ONE OF THEM
WHEN IT BURST OUT OF THE FRONT DOOR AND INFORMED THE WORLD THAT BREAKFAST WAS ON THE TABLE
HE WAS SUSPECTED OF SELLING HIS VOTE IN CONGRESS AND PROBABLY HE DID
THEN WE RUN ALONG THE--YES--THE COMB--TO THE TUMBLER THAT'S BRIMSTONE
CONGRESSMEN JEX AND FLUKE ARE WAVERING
HE WAS A POWER IN THE CONGRESSIONAL PRAYER MEETING AND IN ALL MOVEMENTS THAT LOOKED TO THE SPREAD OF RELIGION AND TEMPERANCE
IN PUBLIC SHE WAS BEYOND HIS REACH AND NEVER GAVE OCCASION TO THE SUSPICION THAT SHE HAD ANY AFFAIR WITH HIM
WE SHALL STAY HERE A FEW DAYS IF YOU CAN GIVE US A ROOMY SUITE OF APARTMENTS HARRY USUALLY HAD THE BEST OF EVERYTHING WHEREVER HE WENT AS SUCH FELLOWS ALWAYS DO HAVE IN THIS ACCOMMODATING WORLD
THE HAPPINESS WAS ONLY A GLEAM WHICH DEPARTED AND LEFT HIM THOROUGHLY MISERABLE
PHILIP WAS OPPRESSED WITH THE HEAVY AIR
SHE SHOWS YOU HER ROOMS NOW AND LETS YOU TAKE ONE--BUT SHE MAKES YOU PAY IN ADVANCE FOR IT
THERE IS THE COMIC BASSO WHO IS SO AMUSING AND ON SUCH FAMILIAR TERMS WITH THE AUDIENCE AND ALWAYS SINGS THE BARBER
D.W HIS PEN THEREFORE AND WHEREAS AND NOT AS AFORESAID STRAYED OFF INTO OTHER SCRIBBLING
WHATEVER CRUEL SUSPICION OR NAMELESS DREAD THIS WAS LAURA TRIED BRAVELY TO PUT IT AWAY AND NOT LET IT CLOUD HER HAPPINESS
IT PLEASED HER IMAGINATION TO FANCY HERSELF A QUEEN IN IT
BUT I CAN'T TAKE YOU
SO FAR FROM BEING HAMPERED BY THIS THE GOSSIPS SEEMED TO GAIN ALL THE MORE FREEDOM FROM IT
FOR HARRY WOULD HAVE SOMETHING AND COL
AND WE ARE ALSO SPEAKING OF THESE THREE ESTATES WHEN WE SAY THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL WAS EITHER CHEWING NATURAL LEAF TOBACCO PREPARED ON HIS OWN PREMISES OR SMOKING THE SAME IN A CORN-COB PIPE
HE GRIEVED TO SAY THAT ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS DISPENSATIONS OF AN INSCRUTABLE PROVIDENCE WHICH ARE DECREED FROM TIME TO TIME BY HIS WISDOM AND FOR HIS RIGHTEOUS PURPOSES HAD GIVEN THIS CONSPIRATOR'S TALE A COLOR OF PLAUSIBILITY,--BUT THIS WOULD SOON DISAPPEAR UNDER THE CLEAR LIGHT OF TRUTH WHICH WOULD NOW BE THROWN UPON THE CASE
HERE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AROSE AND SAID YOUR HONOR I MUST POSITIVELY OBJECT TO LETTING THE WITNESS WANDER OFF INTO ALL THESE IRRELEVANT DETAILS MR BRAHAM
BUT HER BRAIN WAS NOT SELDOM BUSY WITH SCHEMES ABOUT IT
LAURA RECEIVED MR PHILIP WITH A COURTESY AND A SLIGHT HAUTEUR THAT RATHER SURPRISED AND NOT A LITTLE INTERESTED HIM
TO HIS SURPRISE HE FOUND THAT EVERY SITUATION IN THE EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT OF THE JOURNALS WAS FULL ALWAYS HAD BEEN FULL WAS ALWAYS LIKELY TO BE FULL
HE HAD BEEN PREPARING HIMSELF FOR THE WORST BUT AFTER ALL HIS PREPARATION THE BARE SUGGESTION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A VERDICT STRUCK HIM COLD AS DEATH
LORD BLESS US THIS IS ALL NONSENSE
DON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP MY BOY--DON'T DO IT
HIS PLAN WAS TO FILL A TORPEDO WITH GREEK FIRE AND POISONOUS AND DEADLY MISSILES ATTACH IT TO A BALLOON AND THEN LET IT SAIL AWAY OVER THE HOSTILE CAMP AND EXPLODE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT WHEN THE TIME-FUSE BURNED OUT
HE WAS SOMEWHAT BRUISED BUT HE WAS TOO ANGRY TO MIND THAT
HIS EASY FAMILIARITY WITH GREAT MEN WAS BEAUTIFUL TO SEE AND WHEN PHILIP LEARNED WHAT A TREMENDOUS UNDERGROUND INFLUENCE THIS LITTLE IGNORAMUS HAD HE NO LONGER WONDERED AT THE QUEER APPOINTMENTS AND THE QUEERER LEGISLATION
IT HAD BEEN A BAD WINTER SOMEHOW FOR THE FIRM OF PENNYBACKER BIGLER AND SMALL
THE CLERK SAYS THAT THE GENTLEMAN ASKED HER WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE HIM FOR AND THAT SHE REPLIED HE IS GOING TO EUROPE AND I OUGHT TO JUST SAY GOOD BY COL
SHE SEEMED WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS OF HIM AND SO HE COULD NOT FLIRT WITH ANY SPIRIT
SELLERS AND HARRY SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO ROUGHLY MAP OUT THE CITY OF NAPOLEON ON A LARGE PIECE OF DRAWING PAPER
CONSEQUENTLY SHE WAS MUCH COURTED AND AS MUCH ENVIED
I'VE BEEN STUDYING IT FOR TWENTY YEARS
I'LL TAKE--I'LL TAKE--WHAT A FOOL I AM!--I'LL TAKE ANYTHING HE'LL GIVE THE NEXT INSTANT HE LEFT THE HOUSE ON A RUN
ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT IN THE CROWDED THEATRE--PHILIP WAS TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER THE OLD CHAMBERS STREET BOX WHERE THE SERIOUS BURTON LED HIS HILARIOUS AND PAGAN CREW--IN THE INTERVALS OF THE SCREAMING COMEDY WHEN THE ORCHESTRA SCRAPED AND GRUNTED AND TOOTED ITS DISSOLUTE TUNES THE WORLD SEEMED FULL OF OPPORTUNITIES TO PHILIP AND HIS HEART EXULTED WITH A CONSCIOUS ABILITY TO TAKE ANY OF ITS PRIZES HE CHOSE TO PLUCK
AND SO ON
AND SO ON
AT SALT LAKE LATER TELEGRAMS TOLD HIM OF THE ACQUITTAL AND HIS GRATITUDE WAS BOUNDLESS--SO BOUNDLESS INDEED THAT SLEEP WAS DRIVEN FROM HIS EYES BY THE PLEASURABLE EXCITEMENT ALMOST AS EFFECTUALLY AS PRECEDING WEEKS OF ANXIETY HAD DONE IT
HE WENT AWAY THE OWNER OF IT AND HAD AMPLE TIME BEFORE HE REACHED HOME IN NOVEMBER TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH POORER HE WAS BY POSSESSING IT
WELL WELL
I KNOW YOU MR TROLLOP
LIKE HER
THEY WALKED THE FLOOR TALKING DISJOINTEDLY AND LISTENING FOR THE DOOR-BELL
YOU HAVE NEITHER HELPED NOR HINDERED--BUT YOU KNOW YOU MAY HELP BY AND BY
THE PLAN OF OPERATIONS WAS VERY SIMPLE
AND SO EVER SINCE THE DAY SHE FOUND OUT SHE HAD ANOTHER FATHER SHE NEVER COULD RUN ACROSS A LAME STRANGER WITHOUT BEING TAKEN ALL OVER WITH A SHIVER AND ALMOST FAINTING WHERE SHE STOOD
HE FELT AT HIS EASE WITH ALICE AND WAS NEVER IN WANT OF SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
IT WAS AS IF SHE PRESUMED UPON THAT AND UPON HER SEX TO DEFY THE LAW
THERE'S A BIGGER WONDER--THE RAILROAD
SENATOR DILWORTHY AND PHILIP WERE IN THE DIPLOMATIC GALLERY
SO YOU TAKE AN UMBRELLA AN OVERCOAT AND A FAN AND GO FORTH
AND ALTHOUGH HARRY PROTESTED TO THE COLONEL DAILY AND TO WASHINGTON HAWKINS THAT HE MUST GO BACK AT ONCE TO THE LINE AND SUPERINTEND THE LAY-OUT WITH REFERENCE TO HIS CONTRACT YET HE DID NOT GO BUT WROTE INSTEAD LONG LETTERS TO PHILIP INSTRUCTING HIM TO KEEP HIS EYE OUT AND TO LET HIM KNOW WHEN ANY DIFFICULTY OCCURRED THAT REQUIRED HIS PRESENCE
THE ENEMY WERE TOTALLY DEMORALIZED
SENDS DOWN WORD THAT SHE IS ENGAGED OR WISHES TO BE EXCUSED"--OR IF SHE IS A PARVENU AND LOW-BRED SHE PERHAPS SENDS WORD THAT SHE IS NOT AT HOME VERY GOOD
BUT THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT LAURA SAID TO HERSELF LONG BRANCH AND CAPE MAY ARE NEARER THAN NEWPORT
PHILIP COULD NOT RESIST THE INCLINATION TO PAY A VISIT TO FALLKILL
BY THE WAY CALLS OUT PHILIP FROM HIS BED-ROOM TO HENRY WHERE IS ST JO WHY IT'S IN MISSOURI SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER I THINK
PUBLIC SENTIMENT SEEMS CHANGING A TRIFLE IN FAVOR OF THE BILL--BUT ONLY A TRIFLE AND STILL LATER
THE NEWSPAPER REPORTERS MADE THEIR PENCILS FLY
TAKE SOME MORE WATER WASHINGTON--YOU CAN'T DRINK TOO MUCH WATER WITH FRUIT--ALL THE DOCTORS SAY THAT
AND WHY NOT MEDICINE PHILIP WOULD LIKE TO HAVE EXPLAINED WHY NOT BUT THE EXPLANATION WOULD BE OF NO USE IF IT WERE NOT ALREADY OBVIOUS TO RUTH
SUCH YEARS WERE THOSE THAT FOLLOWED THE DOUBLE-SHOTTED DEMAND FOR THE SURRENDER OF FORT SUMTER
OTHER LETTERS RECORDED ITS PERILS IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE AND BY AND BY ITS VICTORY BY JUST THE SKIN OF ITS TEETH ON THIRD READING AND FINAL PASSAGE
MR BRAHAM WORE A BROWN FROCK COAT BUTTONED ACROSS HIS BREAST WITH A ROSE-BUD IN THE UPPER BUTTONHOLE AND LIGHT PANTALOONS
IF HE WAS ABSENT A MOMENT HER RESTLESS EYES SOUGHT SOMETHING THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED NOT TO FIND
MR BRAHAM HIMSELF RECEIVED THESE FOND ASSAULTS WITH THE GALLANTRY OF HIS NATION ENDURING THE UGLY AND HEARTILY PAYING BACK BEAUTY IN ITS OWN COIN
THE ENTIRE PANEL FORMED THAT BOASTED HERITAGE COMMONLY DESCRIBED AS THE BULWARK OF OUR LIBERTIES THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY MR MCFLINN OPENED THE CASE FOR THE STATE
WHY IS THEE SO DISCONTENTED IF I MUST SAY IT MOTHER I WANT TO GO AWAY AND GET OUT OF THIS DEAD LEVEL WITH A LOOK HALF OF PAIN AND HALF OF PITY HER MOTHER ANSWERED I AM SURE THEE IS LITTLE INTERFERED WITH
HE PETTED HER LISTENED TO HER TROUBLES AND SAID HE WOULD FIND HER FRIENDS FOR HER
IT HAD BEEN SIGNED BY EVERYBODY OF ANY IMPORTANCE IN MISSOURI AND WOULD BE PRESENTED IMMEDIATELY
WE'LL NEVER SEE THE DAY NANCY--NEVER IN THE WORLD--NEVER NEVER NEVER CHILD
HE HAD THE WALL STREET SLANG AT HIS TONGUE'S END
BUT THIS DID NOT MUCH MATTER FOR HARRY WAS ALWAYS SUPERIOR TO HIS CLOTHES
ONE LOOKING FOR A REAL HERO WOULD HAVE TO GO ELSEWHERE
BUT HER MOTHER SAW CLEARLY ENOUGH HER STRUGGLE WITH INFIRMITY AND WAS NOT DECEIVED BY EITHER HER GAIETY OR BY THE CHEERFUL COMPOSURE WHICH SHE CARRIED INTO ALL THE ORDINARY DUTIES THAT FELL TO HER
THEN HE WOULD GO INTO THE TUNNEL AND ASK THE MEN IF THERE WERE NO SIGNS YET
IT REQUIRED FOUR DAYS NOW FOR THE LAWYERS TO SUM UP THESE ARGUMENTS OF THE COUNSEL WERE VERY IMPORTANT TO THEIR FRIENDS AND GREATLY ENHANCED THEIR REPUTATION AT THE BAR BUT THEY HAVE SMALL INTEREST TO US
THESE THOUGHTS MADE HIM WEEP AND WEEP MORE BROKEN-HEARTEDLY THAN EVER
EVERY OTHER PERSON WAS AN ASPIRANT FOR A PLACE OR IF HE HAD ONE FOR A BETTER PLACE OR MORE PAY
I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU COL
I HAVE GOT TO GIVE IT UP ALL THIS HARD WORK LOST
HE EXULTED WHEN HE THOUGHT OF HIS MILLIONS
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU GOT IN THE PRESENCE OF SO MANY MILLIONS WASHINGTON COULD NOT KEEP FROM BLUSHING WHEN HE HAD TO CONFESS THAT HE HAD BUT EIGHTEEN DOLLARS IN THE WORLD
I'D DRUTHER SCRIMP ALONG ON TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THERE THAN SUFFER AND WORRY HERE ON A REAL DECENT INCOME MISS GASHLY--"WELL THEN I WISH YOU'D TAKE US BACK MOTHER
SIT DOWN
AFFECTION AND DEVOTION ARE QUALITIES THAT ARE ABLE TO ADORN AND RENDER BEAUTIFUL A CHARACTER THAT IS OTHERWISE UNATTRACTIVE AND EVEN REPULSIVE
BUT IT'S ANOTHER FACT
IF YOU FIND THAT THE PRISONER COMMITTED A HOMICIDE IN POSSESSION OF HER REASON AND WITH PREMEDITATION YOUR VERDICT WILL BE ACCORDINGLY
WHEN LAURA WAS CONVICTED THEN THE PUBLIC WOULD TURN AROUND AND ABUSE THE GOVERNOR IF HE DID NOT PARDON HER
CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR BRAHAM MIST-ER.....ER BRIERLY MR BRAHAM HAD IN PERFECTION THIS LAWYER'S TRICK OF ANNOYING A WITNESS BY DRAWLING OUT THE MISTER AS IF UNABLE TO RECALL THE NAME UNTIL THE WITNESS IS SUFFICIENTLY AGGRAVATED AND THEN SUDDENLY WITH A RISING INFLECTION FLINGING HIS NAME AT HIM WITH STARTLING UNEXPECTEDNESS MIST-ER.....ER BRIERLY
BUT HE WAS NOT ADMITTED
SHE WROTE WASHINGTON TO LOOK FOR HER AND COL
JUMP DOWN FRANCOIS DEAR AND SHOW THE LADIES WHAT A CRUEL LIMP YOU'VE GOT YET FRANCOIS DEMURRED BUT BEING COAXED AND DELIVERED GENTLY UPON THE FLOOR HE PERFORMED VERY SATISFACTORILY WITH HIS RIGHT HAND HIND LEG IN THE AIR
AND ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT WHEN A WORD OF ADVICE FROM BERIAH SELLERS CAN HELP IT IS AT YOUR SERVICE
CHAPTER XLV
SUCH YEARS WERE THOSE THAT FOLLOWED THE LITTLE SCRIMMAGE ON LEXINGTON COMMON
MY RESPECTS TO THOMPSON
I KNOW THEY CAN'T WAIT FOR THE ORDERS TO GO TO NEW YORK AND BE CASHED BUT WHAT'S THE REASON THEY CAN'T GET THEM DISCOUNTED IN HAWKEYE OF COURSE THEY CAN
IT IS THE OLD STORY
IF HE WEREN'T LAME I SHOULD THINK HE WAS GOING TO RUN OFF WITH HER OH THAT'S NOTHING
SHE PASSED FOR AN ACCOMPLISHED GIRL AND NO DOUBT THOUGHT HERSELF ONE AS SHE WAS JUDGED BY ANY STANDARD NEAR HER
COULD SHE HAVE REMAINED THERE THIS HISTORY WOULD NOT NEED TO BE WRITTEN
BUT PHILIP PREFERRED TO TRUST TO HIS OWN STUDY OF THE COUNTRY AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION
NOW SHE'S ILLUMINATING THAT STUFFY CONGRESSMAN FROM MASSACHUSETTS--VULGAR UNGRAMMATCAL SHOVEL-MAKER--GREASY KNAVE OF SPADES
GOOD MORNING
IT WAS NOT OF THE LEAST MOMENT TO LAURA THAT HER QUESTION HAD NOT BEEN ANSWERED INASMUCH AS IT CONCERNED A THING WHICH DID NOT INTEREST HER
IT PROVIDED FOR THE ERECTION OF CERTAIN BUILDINGS FOR THE UNIVERSITY DORMITORIES LECTURE-HALLS MUSEUMS LIBRARIES LABORATORIES WORK-SHOPS FURNACES AND MILLS
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL ROAD BEAUTIFUL
THE VILLAIN SELBY APPEARS AGAIN UPON THE SCENE AS IF ON PURPOSE TO COMPLETE THE RUIN OF HER LIFE
YOU'VE FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT WITH EVERYBODY AGIN YOU AND IF WE HAD GRUB TO GO ON I'M D----D IF WE WOULDN'T STAND BY YOU TILL THE COWS COME HOME
THERE IS COAL THERE
GOOD GOD IF YOU SHOULD ASK ME FOR TEN I SHOULDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GET IT AND YET THAT DAY MR SMALL PENNYBACKER BIGLER AND SMALL CAME TO MR BOLTON WITH A PITEOUS STORY OF RUIN IN A COAL OPERATION IF HE COULD NOT RAISE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
SHE KNOWS THAT HER FATHER LIVES
HE STILL HAD FAITH THAT THERE WAS COAL IN THAT MOUNTAIN
BUT WHEN LOUISE BADE HIM GOOD-BYE AND SHOOK HIS HAND AND SAID DON'T BE CAST DOWN--IT WILL ALL COME OUT RIGHT--I KNOW IT WILL ALL COME OUT RIGHT IT SEEMED A BLESSED THING TO BE IN MISFORTUNE AND THE TEARS THAT WELLED UP TO HIS EYES WERE THE MESSENGERS OF AN ADORING AND A GRATEFUL HEART
WOULD IT NEVER GET ON
DILWORTHY RUINED
IF PHILIP HAD ADOPTED SOME REGULAR PROFESSION EVEN SOME TRADE HE MIGHT NOW BE A PROSPEROUS EDITOR OR A CONSCIENTIOUS PLUMBER OR AN HONEST LAWYER AND HAVE BORROWED MONEY AT THE SAVING'S BANK AND BUILT A COTTAGE AND BE NOW FURNISHING IT FOR THE OCCUPANCY OF RUTH AND HIMSELF

THE STATEMENT FROM LAURA WAS NOT FULL IN FACT IT WAS FRAGMENTARY AND CONSISTED OF NINE PARTS OF THE REPORTER'S VALUABLE OBSERVATIONS TO ONE OF LAURA'S AND IT WAS AS THE REPORTER SIGNIFICANTLY REMARKED INCOHERENT BUT IT APPEARED THAT LAURA CLAIMED TO BE SELBY'S WIFE OR TO HAVE BEEN HIS WIFE THAT HE HAD DESERTED HER AND BETRAYED HER AND THAT SHE WAS GOING TO FOLLOW HIM TO EUROPE
TO LEARN TO BE GOOD
NOTHING NEW WAS ELICITED EXCEPT FROM THE CLERK IN REPLY TO A QUESTION BY MR BRAHAM THE FACT THAT WHEN THE PRISONER ENQUIRED FOR COL
I CARRY THE BLOOD OF ELEVEN GENERATIONS OF SOLDIERS IN MY VEINS THE PHYSICIAN--HIMSELF A MAN WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE IN THE NAVY IN HIS TIME--TOUCHED HIS HAT TO THIS LITTLE HERO AND PASSED ON
ONCE WHEN YOU RENEWED YOUR TICKET AFTER STOPPING OVER IN BALTIMORE
LITTLE BY LITTLE IT WAS DRAGGED OUT OF THE WITNESS THAT LAURA HAD BEHAVED STRANGELY THERE APPEARED TO BE SICK AND HE HAD TAKEN HER HOME
BOUTWELL'S GOT THE RIGHT NOTION ABOUT THE VALUE OF PAPER BUT HE LACKS COURAGE
HE WORE THIS MORNING A SOFT HAT A SHORT CUTAWAY COAT AN OPEN VEST DISPLAYING IMMACULATE LINEN A LEATHERN BELT ROUND HIS WAIST AND TOP-BOOTS OF SOFT LEATHER WELL POLISHED THAT CAME ABOVE HIS KNEES AND REQUIRED A STRING ATTACHED TO HIS BELT TO KEEP THEM UP
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT NOW WASHINGTON WAS SO DAZED BY HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND SO BEWILDERED BY THE GAUDY PAGEANT OF DREAMS THAT WAS ALREADY TRAILING ITS LONG RANKS THROUGH HIS BRAIN THAT HE WANDERED HE KNEW NOT WHERE AND SO LOITERED BY THE WAY THAT WHEN AT LAST HE REACHED HOME HE WOKE TO A SUDDEN ANNOYANCE IN THE FACT THAT HIS NEWS MUST BE OLD TO LAURA NOW FOR OF COURSE SENATOR DILWORTHY MUST HAVE ALREADY BEEN HOME AND TOLD HER AN HOUR BEFORE
IF THIS WERE A WORK OF FICTION WE SHOULD NOT DARE TO DISPOSE OF LAURA OTHERWISE
WEIGHTY OLD HEAD
WE ARE GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN EXCLAIMED THE SQUIRE HEARTILY YOU ARE WELCOME MR BRIERLY ANY FRIEND OF PHIL'S IS WELCOME AT OUR HOUSE IT'S MORE LIKE HOME TO ME THAN ANY PLACE EXCEPT MY OWN HOME CRIED PHILIP AS HE LOOKED ABOUT THE CHEERFUL HOUSE AND WENT THROUGH A GENERAL HAND-SHAKING
BUT HE WAS A VERY DELIGHTFUL GENTLEMAN AND HIS LITTLE FOIBLE DID NOT HURT HIM AT ALL
THEN HE PUT HER IN A STATE-ROOM WITH HIS CHILDREN AND TOLD THEM TO BE KIND TO HER THE ADULTS OF HIS PARTY WERE ALL BUSY WITH THE WOUNDED AND STRAIGHTWAY BEGAN HIS SEARCH
HE MOTIONED THE BOX AWAY AND ASKED FOR SOME PARTICULAR HAVANA'S THOSE IN SEPARATE WRAPPERS
WE LEARN THAT APPROACHES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE HEIRS OF THE LATE HON
AND WHEN HE SAT DOWN HE HAD MARRIED LOUISE BUILT A HOUSE REARED A FAMILY MARRIED THEM OFF SPENT UPWARDS OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON MERE LUXURIES AND DIED WORTH TWELVE MILLIONS
IT WAS ON THIS VISIT ALSO THAT THE SENATOR MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MR WASHINGTON HAWKINS AND WAS GREATLY TAKEN WITH HIS INNOCENCE HIS GUILELESS MANNER AND PERHAPS WITH HIS READY ADAPTABILITY TO ENTER UPON ANY PLAN PROPOSED
HAD HE NOT HELPED TO BUILD AND FURNISH THIS VERY COURT HOUSE
HE COULD NEVER BE AWAY FROM HER LONG DAY OR EVENING
BUT THAT WAS NOT MATTER FOR REMARK FOR SHE DID NOT DIFFER FROM THE MOURNFUL FRIENDS ABOUT HER IN THAT RESPECT
THAT GAWKY LOOKING PERSON WITH MISS HAWKINS THERE
EVERYBODY USES IT THOUGH AND EVERYBODY GETS COMFORT OUT OF IT
A STRAIGHT OBJECT LAY UPON IT COVERED WITH A SHEET
HAVE YOU FIGURED UP THE TOTAL OF THE DISBURSEMENTS I TOLD YOU OF NO I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT WELL LETS SEE
DIVISION
ONE SENATOR WHO WAS ACCUSED IN THE PUBLIC PRINTS OF SELLING HIS CHANCES OF RE-ELECTION TO HIS OPPONENT FOR $50,000 AND HAD NOT YET DENIED THE CHARGE SAID THAT THE PRESENCE IN THE CAPITAL OF SUCH A CREATURE AS THIS MAN NOBLE TO TESTIFY AGAINST A BROTHER MEMBER OF THEIR BODY WAS AN INSULT TO THE SENATE ANOTHER SENATOR SAID LET THE INVESTIGATION GO ON AND LET IT MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS MAN NOBLE
DIDN'T YOU SHOW HIM HE WAS IN ERROR ABOUT THE BILL I DID
JOHN JAY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WERE WELL ENOUGH IN THEIR DAY BUT THE NATION HAS MADE PROGRESS SINCE THEN
THEY WERE UNCOUTH AND NOT CULTIVATED AND NOT PARTICULARLY INDUSTRIOUS
JUST AS IT LEFT THE TOWN HOWEVER IT WAS CHEERED AND ASSISTED BY A GUIDE-BOARD UPON WHICH WAS THE LEGEND 10 MILS TO HAWKEYE THE ROAD HAD NEVER BEEN MADE EXCEPT BY THE TRAVEL OVER IT AND AT THIS SEASON--THE RAINY JUNE--IT WAS A WAY OF RUTS CUT IN THE BLACK SOIL AND OF FATHOMLESS MUD-HOLES
IT WAS AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO ANY INDUSTRIOUS MAN TO SEE THIS YOUNG FELLOW RISE CAREFULLY DRESS HIMSELF EAT HIS BREAKFAST DELIBERATELY SMOKE HIS CIGAR TRANQUILLY AND THEN REPAIR TO HIS ROOM TO WHAT HE CALLED HIS WORK WITH A GRAVE AND OCCUPIED MANNER BUT WITH PERFECT CHEERFULNESS
IF WE DON'T FIND ANYTHING WE WON'T BRING IN NO BILL AGAINST YOU
HE'S TUCK AN GAWMED IT ALL OVER ON THE INSIDE WITH PLARSTERIN WHAT'S PLASTERIN I DONO
HE ALWAYS TALKED LIKE A CAPITALIST AND ENTERED WITH ENTHUSIASM INTO ALL THE LAND AND RAILWAY SCHEMES WITH WHICH THE AIR WAS THICK
WHAT WOULD THE MORNING BRING
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A REVOLUTION IN THIS WORLD'S AFFAIRS THAT WILL MAKE MEN DIZZY TO CONTEMPLATE
THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN WILL BE A LITTLE INCONVENIENCE MRS BOLTON LOOKED GRAVE AND ANXIOUS BUT SHE DID NOT COMPLAIN OR REMONSTRATE
I FEEL THAT I CAN TRUST YOU
AT FIRST HE WAS FULL OF VENGEANCE ON THE COMPANY
SAY I AM YOUR MOTHER!--I HAVE LOVED YOU SO LONG AND THERE IS NO OTHER
PERHAPS HIS MANLY WAY DID WIN HER LIKING
SHE--SHE--DIDN'T ACCEPT ME NO
THE ENGINEERS REPORTED THAT THE RAILROAD COULD COME IN BY TAKING A LITTLE SWEEP AND CROSSING THE STREAM ON A HIGH BRIDGE BUT THE GRADES WOULD BE STEEP
WHEN LAURA HAD BEEN IN WASHINGTON THREE MONTHS SHE WAS STILL THE SAME PERSON IN ONE RESPECT THAT SHE WAS WHEN SHE FIRST ARRIVED THERE--THAT IS TO SAY SHE STILL BORE THE NAME OF LAURA HAWKINS
YOU THROW HIM ON HIS COUNTRY
OH I DON'T THINK I SHOULD COME TO FALLKILL TO PRACTICE BUT I MUST DO SOMETHING WHEN I AM THROUGH SCHOOL
IT WILL BENEFIT ME A GREAT DEAL I ONLY WISH I COULD SEE HOW
WASHINGTON SENT GRAND GOOD NEWS TO COL
CHAPTER XI
MILLIONS YES IT WILL BE A GREAT SUM BUT HOW GREAT LAURA
THEN MR DILWORTHY MADE ANOTHER MOVE
IT WAS ABOUT THE HOUR NOW FOR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON BENEVOLENT APPROPRIATIONS TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE AND LAURA STEPPED TO THE DOOR TO RECONNOITER
HE WENT AWAY AND CONFERRED WITH THE PROPRIETOR
THIS WAS TO BE A SCHOOL OF MINING OF ENGINEERING OF THE WORKING OF METALS OF CHEMISTRY ZOOLOGY BOTANY MANUFACTURES AGRICULTURE IN SHORT OF ALL THE COMPLICATED INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE A STATE GREAT
BUT SHE SHOWED HIM NO DOUBTS
HE'S BOUND TO SET US ALL CRAZY OF COURSE
YES BORN EAST MYSELF RAISED ALL ALONG KNOW THE WEST--A GREAT COUNTRY GENTLEMEN
THAT GIVES SIX FEET SCANT IN THE HEAD OF MURDERER'S CHUTE
HE WISHED HE HAD NEVER COME THERE AND SPIED OUT THIS CRUEL POVERTY AND BROUGHT PAIN TO THAT POOR LITTLE LADY'S HEART AND SHAME TO HER CHEEK
DO THEY SAY I SHOT HIM AND SHE WOULD SAY NO MORE
BUT THIS IT ANGERED HIM AFTERWARDS TO THINK WAS IN PRIVATE
YOU KNOW THE PARTIES HERE YOU ARE A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY KNOW THEM ALL FROM INFANCY SIR
DID HE NOT KNOW THAT THE VERY SPITTOON WHICH HIS JUDGESHIP USED COST THE CITY THE SUM OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU GOT THAT BASKET OF CHAMPAGNE
THE DISTRICT WAS CALLED THE KNOBS OF EAST TENNESSEE AND HAD A REPUTATION LIKE NAZARETH AS FAR AS TURNING OUT ANY GOOD THING WAS CONCERNED
MAKE HIS SOUL IMMORTAL BUT DON'T DISTURB THE NIGGRO AS HE IS OF COURSE ONE OF THE ENTERTAINMENTS OFFERED THE SENATOR WAS A PUBLIC RECEPTION HELD IN THE COURT HOUSE AT WHICH HE MADE A SPEECH TO HIS FELLOW CITIZENS
BUT SHE FASCINATED HIM AND HELD HIM JUST BEYOND THE LINE OF ABSOLUTE FAMILIARITY AT THE SAME TIME
I DON'T MEAN DEPEND HE BEGAN AGAIN
HE SAW EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH HIMSELF IN A LARGE WAY AND IN ROSY LINES
HE WOULDN'T BOTHER HER WITH BUSINESS DETAILS BUT HE HOPED THAT THE DAY WAS NOT FAR OFF WHEN SHE WOULD SEE HIM RETURN WITH A MODERATE FORTUNE AND SOMETHING TO ADD TO THE COMFORT OF HER ADVANCING YEARS
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS ALREADY SOMETHING HORRIBLE
YOU WILL VOTE AND WORK FOR THE BILL FROM MERE AFFECTION FOR THE NEGRO AND I DESIRE TO TESTIFY MY GRATITUDE BECOMINGLY
BUT THEY WERE GOOD AND WISE AND THEY SENT HIM TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
MR HAWKINS AND HIS SISTER TOO ARE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE AMELIORATION OF THE CONDITION OF THE COLORED RACE
SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH QUITE THE OLD HAWKEYE OPENNESS AND CORDIALITY AND FELL TO TALKING AT ONCE OF THEIR LITTLE ACQUAINTANCE THERE
HE WENT INTO THE CITY AND SHOWED HIS LETTER ON CHANGE
THEE HAS TRAINED HER THYSELF AT HOME IN HER ENFEEBLED CHILDHOOD AND THEE KNOWS HOW STRONG HER WILL IS AND WHAT SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN SELF-CULTURE BY THE SIMPLE FORCE OF HER DETERMINATION
YOU CAN'T PUT YOUR FINGER ON A SPOT IN THE MAP OF MISSOURI THAT I DON'T KNOW AS IF I'D MADE IT
FREE
A MAN PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS REFUSES ANOTHER MAN'S FIRST OFFER NO MATTER WHAT IT IS
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID WITH SOME ANNOYANCE
LAURA PURSUED HER USUAL COURSE
SEE THE CONQUERING HERO COMES GAD SAID THE COLONEL TO HIMSELF OLD HICKORY OUGHT TO GET DOWN AND GIVE HIS SEAT TO GEN
HIS LOVE FOR RUTH WAS NO SECRET TO MRS BOLTON AND HE FELT ALMOST SURE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE NO OPPOSITION IN THE FAMILY
AN APPROPRIATION WAS A TANGIBLE THING IF YOU COULD GET HOLD OF IT AND IT MADE LITTLE DIFFERENCE WHAT IT WAS APPROPRIATED FOR SO LONG AS YOU GOT HOLD OF IT
I'VE GOT THE BIGGEST SCHEME ON EARTH--AND I'LL TAKE YOU IN
THEY WERE ALL KNEELING IN A MOMENT
HE OPENED IT
THE MOUNTAIN BEFORE HIM MIGHT BE EIGHT HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND WAS ONLY A PORTION OF A LONG UNBROKEN RANGE SAVAGELY WOODED WHICH FOLLOWED THE STREAM
THE FACT WAS THOUGH PHILIP STERLING DID NOT KNOW IT THAT HE WANTED SEVERAL OTHER THINGS QUITE AS MUCH AS HE WANTED WEALTH
THREE DESERTIONS
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO BE SO PURSUED
IT WAS DECIDED TO VOTE DOWN EVERY PROPOSITION TO ADJOURN AND SO CONTINUE THE SITTING INTO THE NIGHT
SAYS HE WILL BE DONE WITH THEM DIRECTLY THAT A COPPER-PLATE CARD WITH ENGINEER-IN-CHIEF ON IT SHOULD BE RECEIVED WITH SUCH TRANQUILITY AS THIS ANNOYED MR BRIERLY NOT A LITTLE
HE DID KILL ALL THAT WAS GOOD IN ME
ANNUAL INCOME--WELL GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW MANY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS APIECE WASHINGTON WAS SO DAZED SO BEWILDERED--HIS HEART AND HIS EYES HAD WANDERED SO FAR AWAY AMONG THE STRANGE LANDS BEYOND THE SEAS AND SUCH AVALANCHES OF COIN AND CURRENCY HAD FLUTTERED AND JINGLED CONFUSEDLY DOWN BEFORE HIM THAT HE WAS NOW AS ONE WHO HAS BEEN WHIRLING ROUND AND ROUND FOR A TIME AND STOPPING ALL AT ONCE FINDS HIS SURROUNDINGS STILL WHIRLING AND ALL OBJECTS A DANCING CHAOS
AND HE RESENTED IT AND WAS HUFFY WHEN HE WAS WITH HER AND RAN HER ERRANDS AND BROUGHT HER GOSSIP AND BRAGGED OF HIS INTIMACY WITH THE LOVELY CREATURE AMONG THE FELLOWS AT NEWSPAPER ROW
AND AS HE SEATED HIMSELF AND DREW OFF HIS GLOVES A HEAVY SEAL RING WAS DISPLAYED UPON HIS WHITE LEFT HAND
I SAID IT
BUT ON A SECOND VISIT PHILIP WAS NOT SO SURE THE YOUNG LADY WAS CERTAINLY KIND AND FRIENDLY AND ALMOST CONFIDING WITH HARRY AND TREATED PHILIP WITH THE GREATEST CONSIDERATION
AT THE END OF A MONTH THINGS WERE LOOKING BAD
HE COULD LEAVE IT WITHOUT FEAR
GOOD DAY MADAM THE CLOSE OF THE TRIAL RELEASED MR HARRY BRIERLY AND LEFT HIM FREE TO DEPART UPON HIS LONG TALKED OF PACIFIC-COAST MISSION
THERE'S NO STAGE OR ANYTHING AND IF THERE WERE STAGES REQUIRE MONEY
CALLED TWO OR THREE TIMES AFTERWARD AT DILWORTHY'S REQUEST--USUALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT
THAT THE ASSISTANCE RENDERED HIM BY OLD DILWORTHY WAS PRETTY FAIR--PRETTY FAIR
WHEN HE GOT UP THAT IDEA THERE IN VIRGINIA OF BUYING UP WHOLE LOADS OF NEGROES IN DELAWARE AND VIRGINIA AND TENNESSEE VERY QUIET HAVING PAPERS DRAWN TO HAVE THEM DELIVERED AT A PLACE IN ALABAMA AND TAKE THEM AND PAY FOR THEM AWAY YONDER AT A CERTAIN TIME AND THEN IN THE MEANTIME GET A LAW MADE STOPPING EVERYBODY FROM SELLING NEGROES TO THE SOUTH AFTER A CERTAIN DAY--IT WAS SOMEHOW THAT WAY--MERCY HOW THE MAN WOULD HAVE MADE MONEY
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT THE WHOLE NATION HOLD AS MUCH AS THREE-FIFTHS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN ENTIRE CONTEMPT.--THREE-FIFTHS OF YOU ARE DILWORTHYS THE SERGEANT-AT-ARMS VERY SOON PUT A QUIETUS UPON THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATION AND CONVINCED HIM THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE OVER-FREE ATMOSPHERE OF HIS HAPPY-LAND-OF-CANAAN
JURY STILL OUT
POLLY'S HEART WAS NEARLY BROKEN
HE WAS EX-OFFICIO INDIAN AGENT TOO
I'D TAKE THE JOB TO MANAGE CONGRESS
WELL I SHOULD THINK SO NANCY
SHE IS THE REIGNING BELLE OF WASHINGTON AFTER THIS NIGHT
WELL THERE GOES OLD WIDOW HOPKINS--IT ALWAYS TAKES HER A WEEK TO BUY A SPOOL OF THREAD AND TRADE A HANK OF YARN
I HAVEN'T WHISPERED TO A SOUL--NOT A WORD--HAVE HAD MY COUNTENANCE UNDER LOCK AND KEY FOR FEAR IT MIGHT DROP SOMETHING THAT WOULD TELL EVEN THESE ANIMALS HERE HOW TO DISCERN THE GOLD MINE THAT'S GLARING UNDER THEIR NOSES
AND THEN HE DOUBTED IF HE SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH HER AFTER ALL IF SHE WERE AT ALL SENTIMENTAL
CAN SUCH A SLIGHT LITTLE BODY ENDURE THE ORDEAL OF THE PREPARATION FOR OR THE STRAIN OF THE PRACTICE OF THE PROFESSION DID THEE EVER THINK MARGARET WHETHER SHE CAN ENDURE BEING THWARTED IN AN OBJECT ON WHICH SHE HAS SO SET HER HEART AS SHE HAS ON THIS
HE MOVED AMONG HIS HIRELINGS LIKE A KING
HE COULD MAKE A MAGNETIC SPEECH AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE IN THE CLASS ROOM THE DEBATING SOCIETY OR UPON ANY FENCE OR DRY-GOODS BOX THAT WAS CONVENIENT
DON'T KEEP A BODY IN SUCH SUSPENSE
THE HAWKINS FAMILY THOUGH ALLIED TO THE BEST BLOOD OF THE SOUTH WERE AT THE TIME IN HUMBLE CIRCUMSTANCES
LOT OF JIMCRACKS FOR CONGRESSMEN'S WIVES AND CHILDREN--THOSE GO A LONG WAY--YOU CAN'T SPEND TOO MUCH MONEY IN THAT LINE--WELL THOSE THINGS COST IN A LUMP SAY $10,000--ALONG THERE SOMEWHERE
A NARROW SLIT IN THE ROOF ADMITTED SUFFICIENT LIGHT AND WAS THE ONLY MEANS OF VENTILATION
THE PATHETIC STORY OF THE OLD LADY'S MINISTRATIONS AND HER SIMPLICITY AND FAITH ALSO GOT INTO THE NEWSPAPERS IN TIME AND PROBABLY ADDED TO THE PATHOS OF THIS WRECKED WOMAN'S FATE WHICH WAS BEGINNING TO BE FELT BY THE PUBLIC
SI HIGGINS HE'S BEN OVER TO KAINTUCK N MARRIED A HIGH-TONED GAL THAR OUTEN THE FUST FAMILIES AN HE'S COME BACK TO THE FORKS WITH JIST A HELL'S-MINT O WHOOP-JAMBOREE NOTIONS FOLKS SAYS
BUT IT IS A GLORIOUS PROFESSION
HOW GOOD IT LOOKS
ALL THE CAPITAL NEEDED IS TO MANUFACTURE THE FIRST TWO THOUSAND BOTTLES--SAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS--THEN THE MONEY WOULD BEGIN TO FLOW IN
A WOMAN'S INTUITION IS BETTER THAN A MAN'S
IT IS THE LAND THAT'S TO BRING THE MONEY ISN'T IT LAURA
I THINK CONGRESS ALWAYS TRIES TO DO AS NEAR RIGHT AS IT CAN ACCORDING TO ITS LIGHTS
FOR HE WAS ALLOWED TO COOL HIS HEELS A FULL HALF HOUR IN THE ANTE-ROOM BEFORE THOSE GENTLEMEN EMERGED AND HE WAS USHERED INTO THE PRESENCE
WAS THIS TO BE DONE BY TRYING AN OBSCURE ADVENTURER FOR ATTEMPTING TO TRAP A SENATOR INTO BRIBING HIM
BUT IT WOULD BE CHEAPER TO WALK FATHER THEY MUST KNOW YOU THERE AND NO DOUBT THEY WOULD CREDIT YOU IN A MOMENT FOR A LITTLE STAGE RIDE LIKE THAT
ALL THAT ANY ONE FELT SURE ABOUT WAS THAT LAURA'S LANDED ESTATES WERE PRINCELY IN VALUE AND EXTENT AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS ANXIOUS TO GET HOLD OF THEM FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES AND THAT LAURA WAS WILLING TO MAKE THE SALE BUT NOT AT ALL ANXIOUS ABOUT THE MATTER AND NOT AT ALL IN A HURRY
BUT ASKED THE SQUIRE DO YOU MEAN TO ABANDON YOUR LAND IN PENNSYLVANIA THIS TRACK OF LAND SEEMED AN IMMENSE POSSIBLE FORTUNE TO THIS NEW ENGLAND LAWYER-FARMER
BOTH LADIES ROSE WITH GRAVE DIGNITY CONFERRED UPON LAURA A FORMAL INVITATION TO CALL AND THEN RETIRED FROM THE CONFERENCE
AT MIDNIGHT THE HOUSE PRESENTED A SPECTACLE CALCULATED TO INTEREST A STRANGER
DO YOU MEAN TO INSULT ME ROARED THE PROSECUTING OFFICER
BY HIS OWN CONFESSION HE HAS RECEIVED A BRIBE AND DID IT DELIBERATELY
YOU SEE IT STANDS BEFORE THREE OF THE HON
HE SAW AT ONCE THAT SHE WAS OLDER THAN HARRY AND SOON MADE UP HIS MIND THAT SHE WAS LEADING HIS FRIEND A COUNTRY DANCE TO WHICH HE WAS UNACCUSTOMED
CONSEQUENTLY HE PRESENTLY BECAME A POLITICAL LEADER AND WAS ELECTED TO A PETTY OFFICE UNDER THE CITY GOVERNMENT
AND WHEN THESE FAILED HE SAW JEFF STANDING ON A BATTLEMENT MID THE ROCKET'S RED GLARE AND HEARD HIM SING OH SAY CAN YOU SEE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER SLEPT ON THE GROUND
THE MAYOR'LL BE ROUND HERE TO BREAKFAST THE FELLOWS TURNED OUT OF THE TENTS RUBBING THEIR EYES AND STARED ABOUT THEM
I AM ALMOST HAPPY
IT SPOILS A JEST TO HARP ON IT AFTER ONE HAS HAD ONE'S LAUGH
AT SUCH TIMES SHE SEEMED TO PREFER HARRY'S SOCIETY TO HIS
BUT I AM AFRAID HER HARD WORK IS TELLING ON HER TOGETHER WITH HER ANXIETY ABOUT HER FATHER DO YOU THINK ALICE ASKED PHILIP WITH ONE OF THOSE SELFISH THOUGHTS THAT ARE NOT SELDOM MIXED WITH REAL LOVE THAT RUTH PREFERS HER PROFESSION TO--TO MARRIAGE PHILIP EXCLAIMED ALICE RISING TO QUIT THE ROOM AND SPEAKING HURRIEDLY AS IF THE WORDS WERE FORCED FROM HER YOU ARE AS BLIND AS A BAT
IT WAS FIFTEEN MINUTES PAST 8 IN THE EVENING
LAURA ARRIVED BEFORE THE GREAT LECTURE HALL IN A CLOSE CARRIAGE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF THE TIME SET FOR THE LECTURE TO BEGIN
THEY TRIED HARD TO COMFORT HER
HER FAMILY HAVE BECOME ENORMOUSLY RICH BY ONE OF THOSE SUDDEN TURNS IN FORTUNE THAT THE INHABITANTS OF AMERICA ARE FAMILIAR WITH--THE DISCOVERY OF IMMENSE MINERAL WEALTH IN SOME WILD LANDS OWNED BY THEM
HERE'S MR BRIERLY I'VE NO DOUBT WOULD LIKE TO BUY YOUR RAILS WHEN THE TIME COMES O SAID THE MAN I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D FETCH THE WHOLE BILIN ALONG WITH YOU
AND SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE GRANDEUR AND THE SOLEMNITY OF THE SCENE BEFORE THEM AND BY THEIR BELIEF THAT THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH INVISIBLE SPIRITS AND THAT THE FAINT ZEPHYRS WERE CAUSED BY THEIR PASSING WINGS THAT ALL THEIR TALK TOOK TO ITSELF A TINGE OF THE SUPERNATURAL AND THEIR VOICES WERE SUBDUED TO A LOW AND REVERENT TONE
THE DARKENED ROOM THE LABORED BREATHING AND OCCASIONAL MOANINGS OF THE PATIENT THE TIP-TOEING OF THE ATTENDANTS AND THEIR WHISPERED CONSULTATIONS WERE FULL OF SAD MEANING
EXAMINE THEM--EXAMINE THEM--THEY'LL BEAR IT
THERE ARE MANY MOUTHS TO FEED
YOU LOOK LIKE A PERSON WHO NOT ONLY FINDS A DEEP PLEASURE IN ANY LITTLE THING IN THE WAY OF LITERATURE THAT STRIKES YOU FORCIBLY BUT IS WILLING AND GLAD TO SHARE THAT PLEASURE WITH OTHERS--AND THAT I THINK IS NOBLE AND ADMIRABLE--VERY NOBLE AND ADMIRABLE
AND INSTEAD OF GOING RAPIDLY THE TRAIN SEEMED TO CRAWL AT A SNAIL'S PACE
WE ARE SPEAKING IMPARTIALLY OF MEN YOUTHS AND BOYS
THOUGH THEY DO THAT MORE ALREADY THAN THEY REALLY SEEM TO DESERVE
I'M CLEANED OUT DONE FOR EXCEPT MY PLANTATION AND PRIVATE MANSION
WE NEVER CAN GET UP AGAIN
AND THEN HIS SPIRITS FELL A LITTLE LOWER
SENATOR DILWORTHY INTRODUCED HIS YOUNG FRIEND TO INFLUENTIAL MEMBERS AS A PERSON WHO WAS VERY WELL INFORMED ABOUT THE SALT LICK EXTENSION OF THE PACIFIC AND WAS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS WHO HAD MADE A CAREFUL SURVEY OF COLUMBUS RIVER
HE WAS ONE OF THE SOUTHERNERS WHO WERE CONSTANTLY QUOTED AS HEARTILY ACCEPTING THE SITUATION I'M WHIPPED HE USED TO SAY WITH A JOLLY LAUGH THE GOVERNMENT WAS TOO MANY FOR ME
SHE WAS GOING TO HAND IT TO ME ONCE
SIDES DON'T IT CALL EM DE HE-BREW CHIL'EN
AND IT WAS A HAPPY PART OF THE SAME IDEA FOR ME TO COPY THE SPEECH AFTER MR BUCKSTONE HAD WRITTEN IT AND THEN KEEP BACK A PAGE
ON THE LAST DAY OF THE JOURNEY AS THE RAILWAY TRAIN PHILIP WAS ON WAS LEAVING A LARGE CITY A LADY TIMIDLY ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM CAR AND HESITATINGLY TOOK A CHAIR THAT WAS AT THE MOMENT UNOCCUPIED
HARRY ORDERED THE SUPPER AND IT IS PERHAPS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT PHILIP PAID THE BILL
SPILED YOUR CLOTHES
INDEED THEIR LOVE SEEMED MORE PERFECT NOW THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
THE PREVIOUS QUESTION THAT HATED GAG WAS MOVED AND CARRIED
I SAW YOUR NAME IN THE PAPERS
IN HAWKINS'S FAMILY ARE SIX CHILDREN OF HIS OWN AND TWO ADOPTED ONES
IT'S GOT TO BE ENLARGED DEEPENED
MR BUCKSTONE WITH A SUNNY SMILE AND SAID
QUESTION RULED OUT
PHILIP HAD NOT MUCH FAITH IN HARRY'S POWER OF DRAWING AND TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD PAY THE BILL HIMSELF
WHY THAT TENNESSEE LAND NEVER MIND THE TENNESSEE LAND COLONEL
WASHINGTON IS A MICROCOSM AND ONE CAN SUIT HIMSELF WITH ANY SORT OF SOCIETY WITHIN A RADIUS OF A MILE
MIND I TELL YOU
THE YOUNG FELLOW NEVER DREAMED THAT HE WAS MERELY BEING EXPERIMENTED ON
S

THE PIANO WAS SURE TO BE OPEN AND STREWN WITH MUSIC
SOME HAD A THICK JUNGLE OF HAIR UNDER THE CHIN AND HIDING THE THROAT--THE ONLY PATTERN RECOGNIZED THERE AS BEING THE CORRECT THING IN WHISKERS
SELLERS HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT THIS MAN IS STILL LIVING EVERY REASON SIR EVERY REASON
OH IT'S NOT ABOUT THEE WHAT THEN AND IF THERE WAS ANY SHADE OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER TONE PROBABLY RUTH HERSELF DID NOT KNOW IT
MORGEN
I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS AS CORRUPT AS THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT USED TO BE IF THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN THE NOVELS AND I SUPPOSE THAT IS REFORMED I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE REFORM IS TO BEGIN
SELLERS AND WASHINGTON IN LAURA'S CELL 161.  PROMISED PATRONAGE 162.  NO LOVE LIKE A MOTHER'S 163.  CLEANED OUT BUT NOT CRUSHED 164.  THE LANDLORD TAKING LESSONS 165.  TAILPIECE 166.  "WE'VE STRUCK IT 167.  THE MINE AT ILIUM 168.  THE HERMIT 169.  TAIL PIECE 110.  ONE CHANCE OPEN 171.  WHAT HE EXPECTED TO BE 172.  ALAS
I WAS EVERYTHING MONSTROUS
BUT YET IN THAT DAILY PETITION WHICH THIS VERY FAULTY AND NOT VERY CONSISTENT YOUNG CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN PUT UP HE PRAYED EARNESTLY ENOUGH FOR RUTH AND FOR THE BOLTONS AND FOR THOSE WHOM HE LOVED AND WHO TRUSTED IN HIM AND THAT HIS LIFE MIGHT NOT BE A MISFORTUNE TO THEM AND A FAILURE TO HIMSELF
BUT DO NOT CONSIDER THE MATTER SO GRAVELY
HE HAD A BIBLE CLASS IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL OF THE CHURCH WHICH HE ATTENDED AND HE SUGGESTED TO HARRY THAT HE MIGHT TAKE A CLASS DURING THE TIME HE REMAINED IN WASHINGTON
AND COPPER COAL,--EVERYTHING--EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF
I HAD A VISIT YESTERDAY FROM THE SOCIETY'S COMMITTEE BY WAY OF DISCIPLINE BECAUSE WE HAVE A PIANO IN THE HOUSE WHICH IS AGAINST THE RULES I HOPE THEE TOLD THE ELDERS THAT FATHER AND I ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIANO AND THAT MUCH AS THEE LOVES MUSIC THEE IS NEVER IN THE ROOM WHEN IT IS PLAYED
HASN'T IT GOOD TIMBER AND DOESN'T THE RAILROAD ALMOST TOUCH IT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT NOW
HE PLODDED ALONG OVER THE TIES IN A VERY HOT CONDITION OF MIND AND BODY
THAT THEY MUST TALK OVER
INSPIRATION WAS ABOUT TO FIND UTTERANCE
I WANTED TO SEE YOU
COME NOW DOESN'T IT IMPROVE MR TROLLOP OPENED HIS EYES RATHER WIDELY AT THIS NOVEL ASPECT OF THE CASE
HARRY WAS NOT IN
WOULD RUTH BE GLAD TO HEAR HE WONDERED THAT HE WAS COMING EAST
HE SAW NOTHING IN ITS SOCIETY THAT EQUALLED THAT OF HAWKEYE HE SAT DOWN TO NO TABLE THAT COULD NOT BE UNFAVORABLY CONTRASTED WITH HIS OWN AT HOME
HE FOUND A LETTER FROM COL
HOW DOES THAT STRIKE YOUR ENGINEERING EYE MR THOMPSON
PERHAPS SHE DID NOT MIND IT
ONE MORNING HER HUSBAND INFORMED HER THAT HE HAD BEEN ORDERED SOUTH AND MUST GO WITHIN TWO HOURS
BUT HERE IT IS OUT OF PLACE
A BURST OF APPLAUSE FOLLOWED WHICH THE OFFICER PROMPTLY SUPPRESSED
THE PRINTED BILL OF FARE AT DINNER WAS LONGER AND MORE VARIED THE PROPRIETORS JUSTLY BOASTED THAN THAT OF ANY HOTEL IN NEW YORK
BUT WHAT WE WANTED WAS MONEY TO CARRY ON THE WORK--MONEY TO PAY THE MEN CERTAINLY CERTAINLY--TRUE ENOUGH--BUT WE CREDITED YOU BOTH FOR A LARGE PART OF YOUR ASSESSMENTS--I AM SURE THAT WAS IN OUR LETTERS OF COURSE THAT WAS IN--I REMEMBER THAT AH VERY WELL THEN
THE BLUNDERING FELLOW POURED ALL HIS DOUBTS AND ANXIETIES INTO HER EAR AS IF SHE HAD BEEN THE IMPASSIVE OCCUPANT OF ONE OF THOSE LITTLE WOODEN CONFESSIONALS IN THE CATHEDRAL ON LOGAN SQUARE
THE SON
WHETHER HE EVER THOUGHT THAT IF HE COULD SAVE HER FROM RUIN HE COULD GIVE HER UP HIMSELF IS DOUBTFUL
WHY SHOULDN'T I TRY TO MAKE A PLEASANT EVENING
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE BOREAS DROPPED DOWN TO THE FLOATING WRECK AND TOOK OFF THE DEAD THE WOUNDED AND THE UNHURT--AT LEAST ALL THAT COULD BE GOT AT FOR THE WHOLE FORWARD HALF OF THE BOAT WAS A SHAPELESS RUIN WITH THE GREAT CHIMNEYS LYING CROSSED ON TOP OF IT AND UNDERNEATH WERE A DOZEN VICTIMS IMPRISONED ALIVE AND WAILING FOR HELP
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU WELL I'LL TELL YOU OLD FRIEND
SOMETIMES ITS REAL PITIFUL THE WAY THE CHILDERN PINE FOR PARRY--DON'T LOOK SO SAD BRIDGET MA CHERE'--POOR CHILD SHE CAN'T HEAR PARRY MENTIONED WITHOUT GETTING THE BLUES MRS GASHLY--"WELL I SHOULD THINK SO MRS OREILLE
IT WAS AN ACT AS GRACEFUL AS IT WAS SIMPLE
BY AND BY DINNER-TIME CAME AND THE TWO WALKED TO THE GENERAL'S HOUSE
HE WOULD BE A CONSUL NO DOUBT BY AND BY AT SOME FOREIGN PORT OF THE LANGUAGE OF WHICH HE WAS IGNORANT--THOUGH IF IGNORANCE OF LANGUAGE WERE A QUALIFICATION HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CONSUL AT HOME
AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS IDLE
WHY THAT IS STRANGE--BUT COME TO REMEMBER YOU'VE ALL BEEN AWAY TO RICHMOND
CHAPTER XXXI
CLAY IS AT WORK
NEVER HAD ANYTHING OF THAT KIND HAPPEN TO ME BEFORE
IN ONE LETTER THE MAJOR SAID HE AGREED WITH MR HAWKINS THAT THE INQUIRER SEEMED NOT ALTOGETHER ON THE WRONG TRACK
THE NEWS FILLED HIM WITH GRIEF FOR HE LOVED AND HONORED HIS FATHER
THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD BUILT WITH LOVING THOUGHT FOR EACH ONE OF HIS FAMILY AS HE PLANNED ITS LUXURIOUS APARTMENTS AND ADORNED IT
I SEE HIM WITH HER EVERYWHERE AT THE CAPITOL IN THE HORSE CARS AND HE COMES TO DILWORTHY'S
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MORNINGS IN EARLY SPRING WHEN NATURE SEEMS JUST STIRRING TO A HALF CONSCIOUSNESS OUT OF A LONG EXHAUSTING LETHARGY
NONE OTHER REFRESHED HIS LUNGS SO GRATEFULLY
LEVY ON THAT TURPENTINE IN THE FANTAIL-DRENCH EVERY STICK OF WOOD WITH IT THE BOAT WAS A MOVING EARTHQUAKE BY THIS TIME
THE MOON FOUND IT THERE STILL AND FRAMED THE PICTURE WITH THE SHADOW OF THE WINDOW SASH AND FLOODED IT WITH MELLOW LIGHT
IT SCARES OFF SOME OF THE WEAK SUPPORTERS TRUE BUT IT SOON TURNS STRONG ONES INTO STUBBORN ONES
BUT ALAS EVEN HERE AND NOW THE SAME RELENTLESS FATE PURSUED HER
ALL--"INDEED MRS OREILLE--"I'M AFRAID YOU'LL DESPISE THE WEATHER MISS HAWKINS
OH BUT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE
I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT IF A MAN KNOWS HOW TO TALK TO WOMEN AND HAS A LITTLE GIFT IN THE WAY OF ARGUMENT WITH MEN HE CAN AFFORD TO PLAY FOR AN APPROPRIATION AGAINST A MONEY BAG AND GIVE THE MONEY BAG ODDS IN THE GAME
SHE LET HIM IN
SHE WAS NOT WHAT ONE CALLS PRETTY--SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL
AND AFTER A PAUSE NO DISPATCH FROM DILWORTHY FOR TWO HOURS NOW
I HEAR THE BEST REPORTS OF HIM IN NEW YORK THOUGH THOSE SHARPERS DON'T INTEND TO DO ANYTHING BUT USE HIM
WHY MY DEAR INNOCENT BOY WE WOULD JUST SIT DOWN ON THE FRONT DOOR-STEPS AND PEDDLE BANKS LIKE LUCIFER MATCHES WASHINGTON FINALLY GOT HIS BREATH AND SAID
B
AND THE COLONEL SAYS THIS
IS THIS WOMAN A SPECIMEN OF YOUR WESTERN FRIENDS MY ONLY ASSISTANCE REPLIED PHILIP A LITTLE ANNOYED WAS IN TRYING TO KEEP HARRY OUT OF A BAD SCRAPE AND I FAILED AFTER ALL
YOUR BEING WITH HIM SO MUCH IS THE TOWN TALK THAT'S ALL WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY ASKED LAURA CALMLY
MAYBE SI CAN COME WITH THE LETTER NOW AND HE DID
HE FANCIED THAT EVERYBODY ATTACHED TO HIMSELF AN EXAGGERATED IMPORTANCE FROM THE FACT OF BEING AT THE NATIONAL CAPITAL THE CENTER OF POLITICAL INFLUENCE THE FOUNTAIN OF PATRONAGE PREFERMENT JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES
HE RAN DOWN FROM THE GALLERY AND HURRIED HOME TO WAIT
HE COULD DISTINGUISH HER LIGHT FOOTSTEP FROM ALL OTHERS
UPON THIS WAS SPREAD A CLOTH WHICH FROM APPEARANCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS LONG IN USE AS THE TOWEL IN THE BARROOM
SHE HELD HER WATCH BEFORE HER
RUN NOW
HE IS OUR MAINSTAY
A NIGGRO CAN'T STILL REPLIED THE SENATOR GRANTING THAT HE MIGHT INJURE HIMSELF IN A WORLDLY POINT OF VIEW HIS ELEVATION THROUGH EDUCATION WOULD MULTIPLY HIS CHANCES FOR THE HEREAFTER--WHICH IS THE IMPORTANT THING AFTER ALL COLONEL
THERE THERE THAT WILL DO THAT WILL DO YOU SEE YOUR HONOR THERE WERE NO QUESTIONS ASKED ME AND I THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LULL IN THE PROCEEDINGS TO EXPLAIN TO THE JURY A VERY SIGNIFICANT TRAIN OF THE JUDGE
HE GOT UP AND WALKED THE FLOOR AND GAVE HIMSELF A MOMENT FOR REFLECTION
EVEN A DISPATCH FROM HIM WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING JUST TO VARY THIS THING THEY WAITED TWENTY MINUTES
THE COLLEGE WAS A SMALL ONE AND IT SUSTAINED ITSELF NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY IN THIS CITY WHICH IS SO CONSERVATIVE AND IS YET THE ORIGIN OF SO MANY RADICAL MOVEMENTS
AND INCREASED HER FEELING OF BEING STIFLED
SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE PRESENCE OF A LIVING UNITED STATES SENATOR THAT DURING THREE MINUTES NOT A SPIT BALL WAS THROWN
HE BEGGED HIM TO COME AGAIN AND AGAIN WHICH HE DID
THE SENATOR WROUGHT IN BIBLE CLASSES AND NOTHING COULD KEEP HIM AWAY FROM THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS--NEITHER SICKNESS NOR STORMS NOR WEARINESS
I THINK YOU ARE A LITTLE MISTAKEN ABOUT IT'S EVER HAVING COST ANYTHING FOR CONGRESSIONAL VOTES
ONCE FOR THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
IT'S DE ALMIGHTY
4,231,--AN-ACT-TO-FOUND-AND-INCORPORATE-THE KNOBS-INDUSTRIAL-UNIVERSITY
IT IS BOUND TO TARNISH THE GOOD NAME OF THE COMPANY
YOU SEE OUR EXPERIENCE--LIVING RIGHT AMONG BOOKS ALL THE TIME--THAT SORT OF THING MAKES US ABLE TO HELP A CUSTOMER MAKE A SELECTION YOU KNOW NOW DOES IT INDEED
SHE HAD NOT GIVEN MUCH HEED TO THIS BUT SHE SAW ITS JUSTICE NOW IN A DASH OF REVEALING DESIRE
I'M DEEFE
THE LAW
HE COULD NOT TRACE IT BACKWARD TO ITS FOUNTAIN HEAD AND SO HE COULD NOT TELL WHO IT WAS THAT STARTED IT
MANY HATS WERE PRESENT BUT NONE WERE ERECT AND NO TWO WERE CANTED JUST ALIKE
YOU SHALL KNOW HIM SOME DAY MY LOUISE AND KNOWING HIM YOU WILL HONOR HIM AS I DO HARRY WROTE
BUT AT LAST A CHANGE CAME AND THE PROMISES BEGAN TO FAIL WITH ALARMING RAPIDITY
FAR BE IT FROM HIM TO CAST ANY SUSPICION UPON THE MOTIVES OF THE ABLE ELOQUENT AND INGENIOUS LAWYERS OF THE STATE
THE LITTLE COMPANY ASSEMBLED ON THE LOG WERE ALL CHILDREN AT LEAST IN SIMPLICITY AND BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE IGNORANCE AND THE REMARKS THEY MADE ABOUT THE RIVER WERE IN KEEPING WITH THE CHARACTER
SENATOR DILWORTHY BEGAN TO THINK THE HARVEST WAS RIPE
THAT IS TO SAY WITH ELIZABETHAN STATELINESS ON THE PART OF THE DOWAGER AND AN EASY GRACE AND DIGNITY ON THE PART OF THE YOUNG LADY THAT HAD A NAMELESS SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT SUGGESTED CONSCIOUS SUPERIORITY
SOONER OR LATER HE MUST TAKE A CHANCE IT IS PROBABLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LACK OF ENTERPRISE IN WOMEN THAT THEY ARE NOT SO FOND OF STOCK SPECULATIONS AND MINE VENTURES AS MEN
MR BRAHAM DIVIDED WITH LAURA THE ATTENTION OF THE HOUSE
THAT WOULD BRING THE MOST READY MONEY
THE FIRST REFERENCE TO LAURA'S TRIAL HAD BROUGHT THE OLD DEJECTION TO HIS FACE AGAIN AND HE STOOD GAZING OUT OF THE WINDOW AT NOTHING LOST IN REVERIE
OH YES--NOW WE RUN DOWN TO STONE'S LAN--NAPOLEON--NOW WE RUN DOWN TO NAPOLEON
IF RUTH DID NOT FIND SO MUCH LUXURY IN THE HOUSE AS IN HER OWN HOME THERE WERE EVIDENCES OF CULTURE OF INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND OF A ZEST IN THE AFFAIRS OF ALL THE WORLD WHICH GREATLY IMPRESSED HER
WELL NOW DEY'S SOME FOLKS SAYS DEY AIN'T NO FICIENCY IN PRAH
RUSH!--HURRY!--DON'T WAIT FOR ANYTHING IT'S THE SAME OLD BOY NANCY JEST THE SAME OLD BOY--AIN'T HE YES I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE OF THE OLD SOUND ABOUT HIS VOICE YET
SHE'S A GAINING THE CAPTAIN SPOKE THROUGH THE TUBE
GOVERNOR BALLOON WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A FATHER TO THE POOR INDIANS
THEY DROVE UP AT ONE IN THE AFTERNOON IN A RATHER ANTIQUATED VEHICLE WITH A FADED COAT OF ARMS ON THE PANELS AN AGED WHITE-WOOLED NEGRO COACHMAN ON THE BOX AND A YOUNGER DARKEY BESIDE HIM--THE FOOTMAN
THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE AND THEN A BRUTAL LAUGH AND AN EXPLOSION OF CAT-CALLS AND HISSES SALUTED HER FROM THE AUDIENCE
YOU WERE ON WATCH
I WILL GO TO ST LOUIS TOO SIR
IF THA HAIN'T ROOM FOR YOU AND YOURN MY TRIBE'LL TURN OUT AND CAMP IN THE HAY LOFT A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARD WHILE THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE FUNERAL WERE BEING CONCLUDED MR HAWKINS ARRIVED AT HIS WAGON LEADING HIS LITTLE WAIF BY THE HAND AND TOLD HIS WIFE ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND ASKED HER IF HE HAD DONE RIGHT IN GIVING TO HER AND TO HIMSELF THIS NEW CARE
COME ALONG WASHINGTON
NOW ROBERTS YOU ARE SURE ABOUT THIS WHAT--SURE THAT IT'S COAL O NO SURE THAT IT'S THE MAIN VEIN WELL YES
AYES AND NAYS
I AM PROUD TO SEE YOU HERE MR THOMPSON
WE HATE EACH OTHER THROUGH HALF A CONVERSATION AND ARE ALL AFFECTION THROUGH THE OTHER HALF
THE VISIT OF SENATOR DILWORTHY HAD BECOME OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO HER AND IT BY AND BY BORE THE FRUIT SHE LONGED FOR IN AN INVITATION TO VISIT HIS FAMILY IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL DURING THE WINTER SESSION OF CONGRESS
HOW FORTUNATE IT SEEMS NOW THAT WE KEPT THIS THING TO OURSELVES
JUST REFLECT FOR INSTANCE--A MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE SAY $10,000 APIECE--$40,000
THEY TELL ME I AM DETAINED AS A WITNESS AND I PASSED THE NIGHT AMONG A LOT OF CUT-THROATS AND DIRTY RASCALS--A PRETTY WITNESS I'D BE IN A MONTH SPENT IN SUCH COMPANY BUT WHAT UNDER HEAVENS ASKED PHILIP INDUCED YOU TO COME TO NEW YORK WITH LAURA
SLOWLY SHE CAME BACK AS ONE WILLING BUT WELL NIGH HELPLESS
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON BENEVOLENT APPROPRIATIONS ROSE AND MADE HIS REPORT AND JUST THEN A BLUE-UNIFORMED BRASS-MOUNTED LITTLE PAGE PUT A NOTE INTO HIS HAND
LAURA LIKED TO HEAR ABOUT LIFE AT THE EAST AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE LUXURIOUS SOCIETY IN WHICH MR BRIERLY MOVED WHEN HE WAS AT HOME
THE PUBLIC WHO READ THE REPORTS OF THE EVIDENCE SAW NO CHANCE FOR THE PRISONER'S ESCAPE
HE CONFESSED THAT NEITHER HE NOR ANY CITIZEN HAD A RIGHT TO CONSULT HIS OWN FEELINGS OR CONSCIENCE IN A CASE WHERE A LAW OF THE LAND HAD BEEN VIOLATED BEFORE HIS OWN EYES
I'LL BE WITH YOU WITHIN A WEEK
SELLERS IN HIS LETTER TURNED OUT TO BE THE RAISING OF MULES FOR THE SOUTHERN MARKET
WHAT HAD COME OVER THIS THRILLING YOUNG LADY-KILLER
WELL YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT
SEE HOW PERFECTLY FIRM AND JUICY THEY ARE--THEY CAN'T START ANY LIKE THEM IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY I CAN TELL YOU
WHEN THE HOUSE HAD VOTED UPON THE ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF THE REPORT UPON ALL BUT IT AND THE QUESTION NOW BEING UPON ITS DISPOSAL--MR BUCKSTONE BEGGED THAT THE HOUSE WOULD GIVE ITS ATTENTION TO A FEW REMARKS WHICH HE DESIRED TO MAKE
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT IN THE FACT THAT SHE SCRATCHED THE WORD OUT EVERY TIME SHE WROTE IT
FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS HE HAD THOUGHT OF THIS MEETING AND PICTURED IT TO HIMSELF A HUNDRED TIMES BUT HE HAD NEVER IMAGINED IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS
SELBY SHE APPEARED EXCITED AND THERE WAS A WILD LOOK IN HER EYES
HE'S TO GET THE CONTRACTS AND I'M TO PUT THEM THROUGH ON THE DIVIDE
EVEN MISS LAURA HAWKINS THOUGHT IT WORTH WHILE TO USE HER FASCINATIONS UPON HIM AND TO ENDEAVOR TO ENTANGLE THE VOLATILE FELLOW IN THE MESHES OF HER ATTRACTIONS
YES SIR I DID THAT LITTLE THING
THE DOWAGER SAID
THAT OTARD IF YOU PLEASE
WASHINGTON DID NOT KNOW THEN OR AFTER WHAT IT WAS BUT LAURA BOUND HIM NOT TO SEND NEWS OF HER MARRIAGE TO HAWKEYE YET AND TO ENJOIN HER MOTHER NOT TO SPEAK OF IT
STERLING BRIERLY GET UP AND SEE THE CITY
NO MA'M WE I MEAN TAINE--IF I MAY TAKE THE LIBERTY THE CLERK REFLECTED AGAIN--THEN
PERHAPS IT IS ONLY FAIR TO EXPLAIN THAT WE ARE WRITING OF A BY GONE AGE--SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AGO
AND NOW I TELL YOU THAT IS ALL ARRANGED I SUPPOSE YOU'LL TELL ME I OUGHT TO GO HARRY EXCLAIMED LAURA TOUCHING HIS ARM AND LETTING HER PRETTY HAND REST THERE A MOMENT
JEFF GAVE PROSPERITY TO STONE'S LANDING AND NAVIGATION TO GOOSE RUN AND THE TOAST WAS WASHED DOWN WITH GUSTO IN THE SIMPLE FLUID OF CORN
AND THEY DID IT WITHOUT A MURMUR TOO FOR THEY WERE PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS YOU HAD MADE AND WERE GLAD TO PAY YOU THAT LITTLE COMPLIMENT--AND A VERY NEAT ONE IT WAS TOO I AM SURE
LOOK AT ALL THIS COUNTRY NOT ANOTHER BUILDING WITHIN TEN MILES NO OTHER NAVIGABLE STREAM LAY OF THE LAND POINTS RIGHT HERE
BUT ALL IN GOOD TIME WASHINGTON ALL IN GOOD TIME
FATHER ADVANCED MONEY AND TOOK LAND AS SECURITY AND WHATEVER HAS GONE WITH THE MONEY AND THE BONDS HE HAS ON HIS HANDS A LARGE TRACT OF WILD LAND AND WHAT HAS PHILIP TO DO WITH THAT IT HAS GOOD TIMBER IF IT COULD EVER BE GOT OUT AND FATHER SAYS THAT THERE MUST BE COAL IN IT
HAVE YOU ANY CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTIONS TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT NO SIR NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAVE YOU READ ANYTHING ABOUT THIS CASE TO BE SURE I READ THE PAPERS Y'R HONOR OBJECTED TO BY MR BRAHAM FOR CAUSE AND DISCHARGED
PERHAPS HER COUNSEL HAD CALCULATED ON THIS
USED TO BE AT HAWKEYE DURING THE WAR
NO I WAS NEAR FORGETTING ONE OR TWO ITEMS
THE CONTROLLER AND THE BOARD OF AUDIT PASSED THE BILLS AND A MAYOR WHO WAS SIMPLY IGNORANT BUT NOT CRIMINAL SIGNED THEM
HE LEAPED UPON THE BENCH IN FRONT OF THEM AND STRUCK OUT BEFORE HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT FELLING ONE MAN WHO WAS RUSHING ON HIM AND CHECKING FOR AN INSTANT THE MOVEMENT OR RATHER PARTING IT AND CAUSING IT TO FLOW ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM
I'VE BROUGHT THE NOTE LAURA WROTE YOU FOR ONE THING AND I'VE SEEN YOUR UNCLE AND EXPLAINED THE TRUTH OF THE CASE TO HIM
WHEN WE FIRST CAME HERE I WAS MR SELLERS AND MAJOR SELLERS CAPTAIN SELLERS BUT NOBODY COULD EVER GET IT RIGHT SOMEHOW
SOMETIMES THE BOAT FOUGHT THE MID-STREAM CURRENT WITH A VERDANT WORLD ON EITHER HAND AND REMOTE FROM BOTH
ADJOURN
ADJOURN
WASHINGTON GREW PALER AND PALER WEAKER AND WEAKER WHILE THE LAGGING LIST PROGRESSED
LORD BLESS ME AND HERE'S THE CHILDREN TOO
HE SAID TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT AND SAY YOU WILL VOTE FOR ME NOBLE COULD NOT SAY
THE NECESSITY OF THE PASSAGE OF THE UNIVERSITY BILL WAS NOW IMPERATIVE
AFTER YEARS OF SKULKING RETIREMENT AND DISSIPATION DEATH HAD RELIEVED HIM OF HIS TROUBLES AT LAST AND HIS FUNERAL FOLLOWED CLOSE UPON THAT OF MR HAWKINS
BOTH SIDES ARE MARSHALING THEIR FORCES AND THE FIGHT ON THIS BILL IS EVIDENTLY GOING TO BE THE HOTTEST OF THE SESSION.--ALL WASHINGTON IS BOILING CHAPTER XLIV
HE HAD NOT BEEN AT THE MONTAGUE'S SINCE THE TIME HE SAW RUTH THERE AND HE WANTED TO CONSULT THE SQUIRE ABOUT AN OCCUPATION
THE UNIVERSITY THIEVES ARE GETTING SCARED THOUGH THEY WILL NOT OWN IT LATER
GENERAL BOSWELL IS PRETTY NEARLY A POOR MAN NOW
BY THE WAY GENTLEMEN EXCUSE THE LIBERTY BUT IT'S ABOUT MY USUAL TIME THE COLONEL PAUSED BUT AS NO MOVEMENT OF HIS ACQUAINTANCES FOLLOWED THIS PLAIN REMARK HE ADDED IN AN EXPLANATORY MANNER I'M RATHER PARTICULAR ABOUT THE EXACT TIME--HAVE TO BE IN THIS CLIMATE EVEN THIS OPEN DECLARATION OF HIS HOSPITABLE INTENTION NOT BEING UNDERSTOOD THE COLONEL POLITELY SAID GENTLEMEN WILL YOU TAKE SOMETHING COL
I GOT A PRIME SOW AND PIGS IN THE COTE-HOUSE AND I HAIN'T GOT NO PLACE FOR TO PUT EM
IT SIMPLY SAID
AFTER A BIT HE BROUGHT HIS OTHER HAND UP FROM BEHIND HIM AND LAID THREE OR FOUR FRESH WILD FLOWERS UPON THE BREAST BENT OVER AND KISSED THE UNRESPONSIVE LIPS TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND THEN TURNED AWAY AND WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE WITHOUT LOOKING AT ANY OF THE COMPANY
HER THOUGHTS WANDERED BACK OVER HER OLD LIFE AGAIN AND HER TEARS FLOWED UNRESTRAINED
SELLERS BUT HE WOULD DROP EVERYTHING AND GO TO WASHINGTON
BUT D'OLD WOMAN SHE SAY YOU STICKS TO YOUR PISINESS
I AM
BUT DO YOU KNOW THAT I COULD NOT GO INTO POLITICS IF I WERE A LAWYER WITHOUT LOSING STANDING SOMEWHAT IN MY PROFESSION AND WITHOUT RAISING AT LEAST A SUSPICION OF MY INTENTIONS AND UNSELFISHNESS
OLD GOV
NO-O BOTTOM DE-E-P FOUR HALF THREE QUARTER THREE MARK UNDER WA-A-TER THREE HALF TWAIN QUARTER TWAIN DAVIS PULLED A COUPLE OF ROPES--THERE WAS A JINGLING OF SMALL BELLS FAR BELOW THE BOAT'S SPEED SLACKENED AND THE PENT STEAM BEGAN TO WHISTLE AND THE GAUGE-COCKS TO SCREAM
BUT HE WAS NONE THE LESS CHAGRINED AND NOT A LITTLE ANGRY AT THE TURN THE AFFAIR TOOK
GAD SAID THE COLONEL AFTERWARDS THE LANDING IS THE KEY TO UPPER MISSOURI AND IT IS THE ONLY PLACE THE ENEMY NEVER CAPTURED
TO WHAT PURPOSE
THE UNCLE KNEW PHILIP VERY WELL AND WAS PLEASED WITH HIS FRANK ENTHUSIASM AND WILLING ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM A TRIAL IN THE WESTERN VENTURE
ONE LITTLE SENTENCE HAD DONE IT
WOULD HE ONE DAY HEAR THAT SHE HAD DIED A FELON'S DEATH
CHAPTER L
IT EVEN BROUGHT THE SUNSHINE OF A SMILE TO HIS FACE
RUTH HAD KNOWN THEM FROM CHILDHOOD AND SHE USED TO SAY THAT HER FATHER ATTRACTED THEM AS NATURALLY AS A SUGAR HOGSHEAD DOES FLIES
WELL YOU CAN'T CURE IT YOU KNOW BUT YOU CAN PREVENT IT
THE SMALL TABLE THE LAMP STOOD ON
MY MOTHER LIVES IN ST LOUIS
HE COULD SCARCELY RESTRAIN HIS IMPATIENCE WHEN HE CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE
AND HE CLOSED BOTH TO MUCH THE SAME EFFECT
THE OWNER MUST BE A MAN OF GREAT WEALTH THE COLONEL THOUGHT
SELLERS IS MY NAME--BERIAH SELLERS
THE JURY FINALLY THREW THEMSELVES BACK UPON THE INDISPUTABLE FACT THAT SELBY WAS DEAD THAT EITHER WOUND WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM ADMITTED BY THE DOCTORS AND RENDERED A VERDICT THAT HE DIED FROM PISTOL-SHOT WOUNDS INFLICTED BY A PISTOL IN THE HANDS OF LAURA HAWKINS
TELL LAURA--TELL ALL THE CHILDREN
IT WAS THE PECULIAR ODOR OF A CRIMINAL COURT AS IF IT WERE TAINTED BY THE PRESENCE IN DIFFERENT PERSONS OF ALL THE CRIMES THAT MEN AND WOMEN CAN COMMIT
DOES IT MEND THE MATTER BY CALLING HER YOUR SISTER
HE WAS DISTRESSED TO FIND THAT NEARLY EVERY TIME HE SHOWED A YOUNG LADY A POLITE ATTENTION HE WAS STRAIGHTWAY REPORTED TO BE ENGAGED TO HER
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FRIEND OF YOUR FAMILY WASHINGTON AND I THINK I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO DO RIGHT AS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN ACCORDING TO MY LIGHTS
I NEVER LET MR BUCKSTONE HAVE THE SPEECH TILL THE LAST MOMENT AND WHEN YOU HURRIED OFF TO THE HOUSE WITH IT YOU DID NOT KNOW THERE WAS A MISSING PAGE OF COURSE BUT I DID AND NOW PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT IF I REFUSE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL YOU WILL MAKE A GRAND EXPOSURE WELL I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT
SPEAK TO ME CHILD--DO NOT FORSAKE ME
HE IS A HANDSOME OLD GENTLEMAN AND HE IS GALLANT FOR AN OLD MAN MY DAUGHTER SAID THE SENATOR WITH A GRAVE LOOK I TRUST THERE WAS NOTHING FREE IN HIS MANNER FREE REPEATED LAURA WITH INDIGNATION IN HER FACE
IN ANOTHER INSTANT THE BOREAS PLUNGED INTO WHAT SEEMED A CROOKED CREEK AND THE AMARANTH'S APPROACHING LIGHTS WERE SHUT OUT IN A MOMENT
AND IN ALL VILLAGES AND TOWNS OF THE UNION FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE TERRITORIES AND AWAY UP AND DOWN THE PACIFIC SLOPE AND AS FAR AS LONDON AND PARIS AND BERLIN THAT MORNING THE NAME OF LAURA HAWKINS WAS SPOKEN BY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHILE THE OWNER OF IT--THE SWEET CHILD OF YEARS AGO THE BEAUTIFUL QUEEN OF WASHINGTON DRAWING ROOMS--SAT SHIVERING ON HER COT-BED IN THE DARKNESS OF A DAMP CELL IN THE TOMBS
FROM THESE REMARKS HE LEARNED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT LAURA THAT WAS NEWS TO HIM
HOW BEAUTIFUL THE WORLD IS TO AN INVALID WHOSE SENSES ARE ALL CLARIFIED WHO HAS BEEN SO NEAR THE WORLD OF SPIRITS THAT SHE IS SENSITIVE TO THE FINEST INFLUENCES AND WHOSE FRAME RESPONDS WITH A THRILL TO THE SUBTLEST MINISTRATIONS OF SOOTHING NATURE
THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN DIGGING A BOLE IN THE GROUND IF YOU HAVE MONEY ENOUGH TO PAY FOR THE DIGGING BUT THOSE WHO TRY THIS SORT OF WORK ARE ALWAYS SURPRISED AT THE LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY NECESSARY TO MAKE A SMALL HOLE
A VERY AMUSING YOUNG FELLOW AND NOT SO SERIOUS-MINDED AS PHILIP BUT A BIT OF A FOP MAYBE AND THEE PREFERRED THE FOP TO THE SERIOUS-MINDED I DIDN'T PREFER ANYBODY
THAT MEEK YOUNG LADY SO COMMENDED HERSELF TO HIM IN THE SHORT WALK THAT HE ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTIONS OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO HER THE NEXT DAY AN INTENTION WHICH HARRY RECEIVED GLUMLY
AND WE KNOW SUCH-AND-SUCH IS SO-AND-SO BECAUSE MY HUSBAND HEARD COL
THEY HAD PROVED THIS MAN NOBLE GUILTY OF NOTHING THEY HAD METED OUT NO PUNISHMENT TO HIM
TO WHAT IS CALLED THE UPPER CLASSES IT IS THE PRIVILEGE OF THE UPPER CLASSES TO PREY UPON THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF THE PEOPLE
SHE SOON GATHERED THAT MAJOR LACKLAND'S MEMORANDA SEEMED TO REFER TO LETTERS WHICH HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND JUDGE HAWKINS
IN HER LETTER TO RUTH SHE HAD POURED OUT HER HEARTIEST BLESSINGS UPON THEM BOTH WITH HER DEAR LOVE FOREVER AND FOREVER
WAS IT SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY CASE
I'LL RUN OUT AND TELL THE FRIENDS THE NEWS AND HE WRUNG WASHINGTON'S HAND AND WAS ABOUT TO HURRY AWAY WHEN HIS COMPANION IN A BURST OF GRATEFUL ADMIRATION SAID
YOU CAN BEGIN TO SELL TOWN LOTS ON THAT APPROPRIATION YOU KNOW THE SENATOR HIMSELF TO DO HIM JUSTICE WAS NOT VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE COUNTRY OR THE STREAM BUT HE FAVORED THE APPROPRIATION AND HE GAVE THE COLONEL AND MR BRIERLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE WOULD ENDEAVOR TO GET IT THROUGH
I WONDER WHAT HIS LETTER SAYS
THERE IS NO ENJOYMENT SO KEEN TO CERTAIN MINDS AS THAT OF LOOKING UPON THE SLOW TORTURE OF A HUMAN BEING ON TRIAL FOR LIFE EXCEPT IT BE AN EXECUTION
THE LOVELY WOMAN HAD A DEVIL IN HER HEART
THE PEOPLE SEEMED TO HOLD THEIR BREATH
BUT DON'T YOU BE DOWN
WORK AWAY
NOW IF SOMEBODY WOULD COME ALONG AND OFFER $3,000--UH IF SOMEBODY ONLY WOULD COME ALONG AND OFFER $3,000 FOR THAT TENNESSEE LAND YOU'D SELL IT SI SAID MRS HAWKINS EXCITEDLY
THE WIND'S BOUND TO FETCH AROUND AND SET IN OUR FAVOR
AND AT SUCH A TIME WASHINGTON OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN A RAPT AND ENTHUSIASTIC LISTENER BUT HE WAS NOT FOR TWO MATTERS DISTURBED HIS MIND AND DISTRACTED HIS ATTENTION
SHE HEARD TALKING IN THE PARLOR PEARED LIKE IT WAS QUARRELIN WAS AFEARED SUMFIN WAS WRONG
AND THAT THE PIRATE IS ONLY A SEEDY UNFANTASTIC ROUGH WHEN HE IS OUT OF THE PICTURES
THE WAGES RECEIVED BY THIS GREAT HIVE OF EMPLOYEES ARE PLACED AT THE LIBERAL FIGURE MEET AND JUST FOR SKILLED AND COMPETENT LABOR
THE COUNTRY THINKS SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE EXPELLED WELL WHEN NOBODY IS EXPELLED WHAT DOES THE COUNTRY THINK THEN BY THAT TIME THE THING HAS STRUNG OUT SO LONG THAT THE COUNTRY IS SICK AND TIRED OF IT AND GLAD TO HAVE A CHANGE ON ANY TERMS
WOULD YOU--DID YOU WISH ME TO VOTE FOR IT
THEN BOTH LOOKED AT THE CHILD--AND AS THEY LOOKED IT STIRRED IN ITS SLEEP AND NESTLED CLOSER
WASHINGTON SAT IN THE PUBLIC GALLERY AND COL
AS IT WAS HE MANAGED TO KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE--THAT IS TO SAY HE KILLED THE SUGAR SPECULATION BY HOLDING FOR HIGH RATES TILL HE HAD TO SELL AT THE BOTTOM FIGURE AND THAT CALAMITY KILLED THE MULE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGG--WHICH IS BUT A FIGURATIVE EXPRESSION AND WILL BE SO UNDERSTOOD
IT IS A HARSH TERM
IN A WORD EXHAUSTED THE AMUSEMENT-POSSIBILITIES OF THE DECK
THE SAME BITTER WAR OVER THE SUM TO BE PAID WAS FOUGHT OVER AGAIN AND NOW THAT THE AYES AND NAYS COULD BE CALLED AND PLACED ON RECORD EVERY MAN WAS COMPELLED TO VOTE BY NAME ON THE THREE MILLIONS AND INDEED ON EVERY PARAGRAPH OF THE BILL FROM THE ENACTING CLAUSE STRAIGHT THROUGH
IT AFTERWARDS CAME OUT THAT THE CHIEF EXPERT FOR THE DEFENSE WAS PAID A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR LOOKING INTO THE CASE THE PROSECUTION CONSUMED ANOTHER DAY IN THE EXAMINATION OF EXPERTS REFUTING THE NOTION OF INSANITY
HE WAS OFTEN AT MY MANSION SIR FOR WEEKS
THEY DID A FULL DAY'S WORK AND THEN TOOK THEIR LEAVE
SADDER STILL TO SEE IT RESURRECTED AT INTERVALS SHORN OF ITS AFORETIME GAUDY GEAR OF COMPLIMENTS AND CLOTHED ON WITH RHETORICAL TAR AND FEATHERS
MR BRAHAM TAKES OUT A HANDKERCHIEF UNFOLDS IT SLOWLY
YOU AND I WILL NEVER SEE THE DAY BUT THESE LITTLE CHAPS WILL
TAP TO SIGNIFY LAY IN THE LEADS AND AWAY SHE WENT FLYING UP THE WILLOW SHORE WITH THE WHOLE SILVER SEA OF THE MISSISSIPPI STRETCHING ABROAD ON EVERY HAND
MR MCFLINN MADE A VERY ABLE SPEECH
WAS THERE SOMETHING GOOD IN HIM AFTER ALL THAT HAD BEEN TOUCHED
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO TO GIVE HER UP IT SEEMED TO HARRY THAT IT WAS A SITUATION REQUIRING SOME ACTIVE MEASURES
INSTANTLY LAURA LIFTED HIS HEAD AND IN A FAILING VOICE HE SAID WHILE SOMETHING OF THE OLD LIGHT SHONE IN HIS EYES
WHEN IT WAS ENDED THE TRIUMPH WAS COMPLETE--THE TWO-THIRDS VOTE HELD GOOD AND A VETO WAS IMPOSSIBLE AS FAR AS THE HOUSE WAS CONCERNED
INDEED HE VERY SOON SET DOWN MR BRIERLY AS A GENTLEMAN OF LARGE FORTUNE WITH ENORMOUS INTERESTS ON HIS SHOULDERS
OR HE HANDS YOU A VOLUME OF DISTRESSING JOKES OR A COPY OF THE AMERICAN MISCELLANY IF YOU PARTICULARLY DISLIKE THAT SORT OF LITERARY FATTY DEGENERATION OF THE HEART--JUST FOR THE WORLD LIKE A PLEASANT SPOKEN WELL-MEANING GENTLEMAN IN ANY BOOKSTORE
BUT WE CANNOT FOR THE REASON THAT SHE WAS HUMAN
MRS BOLTON MET HIM AT THE DOOR
I WILL PROCEED TO BUSINESS
MR BOLTON SAID PLUMLY
WHEN THE STATESMAN PRESIDED AT GREAT TEMPERANCE MEETINGS HE PLACED WASHINGTON IN THE FRONT RANK OF IMPRESSIVE DIGNITARIES THAT GAVE TONE TO THE OCCASION AND POMP TO THE PLATFORM
I AM DONE WITH THAT FOREVER AND FOREVER WHY NO
THIS CORNER MEANS CONDOLENCE IT IS VERY NECESSARY TO GET THE CORNERS RIGHT ELSE ONE MAY UNINTENTIONALLY CONDOLE WITH A FRIEND ON A WEDDING OR CONGRATULATE HER UPON A FUNERAL
AND SHE SURPASSED HERSELF TO-NIGHT
WHIZ
WITH PLACES TWENTY-FIVE PERSUADED--IT IS GETTING ON
SHE HAD COME TO MINGLE ROMANTIC TEARS WITH LAURA'S OVER THE LOVER'S DEFECTION AND HAD FOUND HERSELF DEALING WITH A HEART THAT COULD NOT RISE TO AN APPRECIATION OF AFFLICTION BECAUSE ITS INTEREST WAS ALL CENTRED IN SAUSAGES
THE MOTION WAS LOST OF COURSE AND THE GREAT INDUSTRIAL UNIVERSITY ACT WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT AS FAR AS IT WAS IN THE POWER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE IT SO
POSTAGE STAMPS WERE NOT NEEDED--THE SENATOR'S FRANK COULD CONVEY A HORSE THROUGH THE MAILS IF NECESSARY
IT WAS MADE UP OF THE FAMILIES OF PUBLIC MEN FROM NEARLY EVERY STATE IN THE UNION--MEN WHO HELD POSITIONS IN BOTH THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND WHOSE CHARACTERS HAD BEEN FOR YEARS BLEMISHLESS BOTH AT HOME AND AT THE CAPITAL
AS THE DAYS WENT BY IT SEEMED PLAIN THAT HE WAS GROWING IN FAVOR WITH LOUISE,--NOT SWEEPINGLY SO BUT YET PERCEPTIBLY HE FANCIED
WE'VE THOUGHT SOME OF THE HOT SPRINGS BUT I DON'T KNOW
SO NOW THE LORDLY FRONT OF THE BUILDING WITH ITS IMPOSING COLONADES ITS PROJECTING GRACEFUL WINGS ITS PICTURESQUE GROUPS OF STATUARY AND ITS LONG TERRACED RANGES OF STEPS FLOWING DOWN IN WHITE MARBLE WAVES TO THE GROUND MERELY LOOKS OUT UPON A SORROWFUL LITTLE DESERT OF CHEAP BOARDING HOUSES
ASSESSMENT OH CERTAINLY WE GOT THOSE LETTERS
COME ON SIR
SHE DID NOT YET COMPREHEND
BUT AS THE GENTLEMAN TURNED AND SHE SAW HIS FULL FACE LAURA PUT OUT HER HAND AND CLUTCHED WASHINGTON'S ARM TO PREVENT HERSELF FROM FALLING
BUT ALL THAT INQUIRY IS NOT LOST
EACH REVERSE HAD WEAKENED THE FATHER'S SPIRIT AND IMPAIRED HIS ENERGIES
AND HER HEART WARMED SOMEWHAT TOO THE WHILE
A FEW DAMAGED CHAIRS
THE SOUTH WOULD COME INTO IT
THE CHILDREN OF THE HAWKINS FAMILY WERE PLAYING ABOUT THE HURRICANE DECK AND THE FATHER AND MOTHER WERE SITTING IN THE LEE OF THE PILOT HOUSE ESSAYING TO KEEP ORDER AND NOT GREATLY GRIEVED THAT THEY WERE NOT SUCCEEDING
IT SHALL NEVER BE SAID THAT BERIAH SELLERS COME IN IT WAS THE TELEGRAPH BOY
THE WORK WENT ON WEEK AFTER WEEK AND AT LENGTH DURING THE NIGHT AS WELL AS THE DAYTIME
MISS HAWKINS IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU WERE CAPABLE OF SUCH A THING AS THAT IT WAS BAD
DOES HE BELIEVE IN ANYTHING OH YES SAID PHILIP LAUGHING HE BELIEVES IN MORE THINGS THAN ANY OTHER PERSON I EVER SAW TO RUTH HARRY SEEMED TO BE VERY CONGENIAL
THE REST OF THE POPULATION WERE LAYING DOWN THEIR EMPLOYMENTS AND GETTING READY TO COME WHEN A MAN BURST THROUGH THE ASSEMBLAGE AND SEIZED THE NEW-COMERS BY THE HANDS IN A FRENZY OF WELCOME AND EXCLAIMED--INDEED ALMOST SHOUTED
SHE COULDN'T SAY THAT SHE DID
IF SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS IN IT IT WOULD PAY TO LOOK INTO IT THE SENATOR LAUGHED BUT RATHER FEEBLY AND SAID BALLOON IS ALWAYS FULL OF HIS JOKES I EXPLAINED IT TO HIM
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE
RUTH DO YOU BELIEVE A WOMAN EVER BECOMES A DEVIL MEN DO AND I DON'T KNOW WHY WOMEN SHOULDN'T
NO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF OFFERING TO CARRY NATIONAL IMPROVEMENT DIRECTORS RELIEF STOCK FOR HIM
NOW LISTEN NANCY--JUST LISTEN AT THIS
GOOD BYE
TO THE CAPITOL SAID WASHINGTON
IT IS HARD TO BEAR WHEN ONE IS YOUNG HE OPENED THE LETTER AND READ
HOW MUCH CHEAPER AND BETTER IT WOULD BE IF THOSE PEOPLE COULD ONLY COME HERE AND DRINK OF OUR CIVILIZATION AT ITS FOUNTAIN HEAD I PERFECTLY AGREE WITH YOU MR BEVERLY
AND WHEN THE EYES OF HUSBAND AND WIFE MET AGAIN THE QUESTION WAS ASKED AND ANSWERED
TWO OR THREE COATLESS YOUNG MEN SAT IN FRONT OF THE STORE ON A DRY-GOODS BOX AND WHITTLED IT WITH THEIR KNIVES KICKED IT WITH THEIR VAST BOOTS AND SHOT TOBACCO-JUICE AT VARIOUS MARKS
THE PRELIMINARIES CONTINUED TO DRAG ALONG IN CONGRESS AND LIFE WAS A DULL SUSPENSE TO SELLERS AND WASHINGTON A WEARY WAITING WHICH MIGHT HAVE BROKEN THEIR HEARTS MAYBE BUT FOR THE RELIEVING CHANGE WHICH THEY GOT OUT OF AN OCCASIONAL VISIT TO NEW YORK TO SEE LAURA
LAURA WOULD GIVE HIM NO SATISFACTION
HE WAS CAPTAIN OF THE HOME GUARDS IN HAWKEYE AND HE NEVER LEFT HOME EXCEPT UPON ONE OCCASION WHEN ON THE STRENGTH OF A RUMOR HE EXECUTED A FLANK MOVEMENT AND FORTIFIED STONE'S LANDING A PLACE WHICH NO ONE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE COUNTRY WOULD BE LIKELY TO FIND
SHE MAY BE DID NOT MUCH HEED THE STILL SMALL VOICE THAT SANG IN HER MAIDEN HEART AS SHE WENT ABOUT HER WORK AND WHICH LIGHTENED IT AND MADE IT EASY PHILIP HAS COME I AM GLAD FOR FATHER'S SAKE SHE SAID TO PHILIP THAT THEE HAS COME
BUT WHEN WE REFLECT THAT THEY DEMAND IT AT THE HANDS OF THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES IT SIMPLY BECOMES MATTER FOR DERISION
HE SAID THAT HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE OF THE HAPPY-LAND-OF-CANAAN
DO YOU KNOW ANY OF THEIR SIGNATURES
HOWEVER THE WASHINGTON DAILY LOVE-FEAST HAILED THE BILL WITH WARM APPROBATION
I TURN AWAY MY HEAD AS ONE WHO WOULD NOT WILLINGLY LOOK EVEN UPON THE JUST VENGEANCE OF HEAVEN
BUT MEDICINE IS PARTICULARLY WOMEN'S PROVINCE WHY SO ASKED RUTH RATHER AMUSED
AND YET ANY ONE WHO HAD KNOWN THE SECRET OF LAURA'S BIRTH AND HAD SEEN HER DURING THESE PASSING YEARS SAY AT THE HAPPY AGE OF TWELVE OR THIRTEEN WOULD HAVE FANCIED THAT HE KNEW THE REASON WHY SHE WAS MORE WINSOME THAN HER SCHOOL COMPANION
THERE WAS SUCH A PANIC AMONG THE TURTLES THAT AT THE END OF SIX HOURS THERE WAS NOT ONE TO BE FOUND WITHIN THREE MILES OF STONE'S LANDING
HIS VOICE WAS LIFTED UP AND HIS VOTE CAST FOR THE LAST TIME IN SUPPORT OF AN INGENIOUS MEASURE CONTRIVED BY THE GENERAL FROM MASSACHUSETTS WHEREBY THE PRESIDENT'S SALARY WAS PROPOSED TO BE DOUBLED AND EVERY CONGRESSMAN PAID SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS EXTRA FOR WORK PREVIOUSLY DONE UNDER AN ACCEPTED CONTRACT AND ALREADY PAID FOR ONCE AND RECEIPTED FOR
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GUIDE
HERE WE ARE--HERE'S WHERE THE SELLERS DYNASTY HANGS OUT
IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME BUT--NOT A WORD OF IT TO MRS SELLERS AND THE CHILDREN
IT SEEMED AS IF THE TRAIN WOULD NEVER REACH BALTIMORE
PHILIP HIMSELF WAS A PREY TO THE CONSTANT FEAR THAT THE MONEY WOULD GIVE OUT BEFORE THE COAL WAS STRUCK
MY DEAR MR BRIERSON THIS IS DREADFUL--PERFECTLY DREADFUL
BUT WE ARE NOT OBLIGED TO AND SO I DON'T SEE THE USE OF IT
OH THAT WILL BE A GLORIOUS DAY
WHEN THE COLONEL WENT AWAY THEY WERE ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED AS SOON AS HE COULD MAKE CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS WHICH HE REPRESENTED TO BE NECESSARY AND QUIT THE ARMY
BUT THE EFFECT OF IT ALL WAS THAT LAURA WAS CONSIDERED TO BE VERY WEALTHY AND LIKELY TO BE VASTLY MORE SO IN A LITTLE WHILE
MRS HIGGINS WAS A PICTURESQUE WOMAN AND A FLUENT TALKER AND SHE HELD A TOLERABLY HIGH STATION AMONG THE PARVENUS
YOU SEE WE'VE GOT TO GET ANOTHER APPROPRIATION THROUGH AND THE COMPANY WANT ME TO COME EAST AND PUT IT THROUGH CONGRESS
JEFF THOMPSON AFTERWARDS TOLD PHILIP THAT HE ONCE ASKED SENATOR ATCHISON THEN ACTING VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ACCLIMATION
MR NOBLE CONTINUED
MR NOBLE CONTINUED
MR NOBLE CONTINUED
SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS ALONE--WITH AN OPEN BIBLE IN HIS HAND UPSIDE DOWN
ONCE ME AND JIM TERRY BUT SELLERS BEGAN TO SPEAK NOW AND THE STORM CEASED
BUT THE FIRST THING IS TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS
IF YOU CAN TELL WHO ARE POOR--THERE'S SO MANY IMPOSTORS
IT SEEMS TO BECOME MORE AND MORE INTERESTING THE OFTENER WE VISIT IT
ENOUGH FOR HIM WAS THE PRESENT ALSO
THIS WAS THE CONDITION OF THE CASE TWO DAYS AFTER THE JURY HAD BEEN SELECTED
YAIT A BIT
AND RUTH LAUGHED HER MERRIEST LAUGH AND THEN LOOKED SOBER AGAIN
THANK GOD I'VE STRUCK IT AT LAST HE LIT A CANDLE AND RAN INTO THE TUNNEL
AND AT THE END OF IT HE WAS SURE TO GET UP AND STRAIGHTEN HIMSELF AND SAY
EVEN YOU AND I WILL SEE THE DAY THAT STEAMBOATS WILL COME UP THAT LITTLE TURKEY RIVER TO WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF THIS LAND OF OURS--AND IN HIGH WATER THEY'LL COME RIGHT TO IT
PERHAPS AFTER ALL--SHE MUST SEE HIM
THEY MIGHT BE TRUE
NOT THAT WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND
THEY DON'T ACQUIT THEY DON'T CONDEMN
BUCKSTONE IS A WORLDLY SORT OF A FELLOW BUT HE HAS CHARITABLE IMPULSES
DID THIS SEEM LIKE A DAMNABLE PLOT TO LAURA AGAINST THE LIFE MAYBE OF A SISTER A WOMAN LIKE HERSELF
I BEG THAT YOU WILL FORGET THIS ABSURD THING MR BUCKSTONE PICKED UP THE SPRAY AND SITTING DOWN BY LAURA'S SIDE ON THE SOFA SAID
THE FRIENDS OF THE BILL HAD BEEN NOT ONLY WILLING THAT ITS OPPONENTS SHOULD EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS BUT HAD STRONGLY DESIRED IT
SELBY WAS THEN PRODUCED
AND GO AND CALL JIM--TELL HIM AYE-AYE SIR THE OLD MAN WAS THE CAPTAIN--HE IS ALWAYS CALLED SO ON STEAMBOATS AND SHIPS
NOR BY THE RECEPTION OF ANY PART OF THE APPROPRIATION NO PART OF IT HAVING COME TO HAND WHY MY DEAR MR BRIERLY THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE I AM SURE WE WROTE YOU AND ALSO MR SELLERS RECENTLY--WHEN MY CLERK COMES HE WILL SHOW COPIES--LETTERS INFORMING YOU OF THE TEN PER CENT
THEY'RE WELL ENOUGH TO WHILE AWAY AN IDLE HOUR WITH OR FURNISH A BIT OF EMPLOYMENT THAT WILL GIVE A TRIFLE OF IDLE CAPITAL A CHANCE TO EARN ITS BREAD WHILE IT IS WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO DO BUT--NOW JUST LISTEN A MOMENT--JUST LET ME GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT WE OLD VETERANS OF COMMERCE CALL BUSINESS HERE'S THE ROTHSCHILD'S PROPOSITION--THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND ME YOU UNDERSTAND WASHINGTON NODDED THREE OR FOUR TIMES IMPATIENTLY AND HIS GLOWING EYES SAID YES YES--HURRY--I UNDERSTAND FOR I WOULDN'T HAVE IT GET OUT FOR A FORTUNE
WHEN LAURA AT LENGTH RAISED HER EYES A LITTLE SHE SAW PHILIP AND HARRY WITHIN THE BAR BUT SHE GAVE NO TOKEN OF RECOGNITION
BOTH MEN HELD ON PRETTY STRENUOUSLY FOR THE COMING BIG PRICES HOWEVER
MR HENRY BRIERLY WAS EXCEEDINGLY BUSY IN NEW YORK SO HE WROTE COL
MIGHT I ASK YOU TO GIVE ME THE TIME
OF COURSE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS
LET ME SEE YOU ALL ONCE MORE THE GROUP CLOSED TOGETHER AT THE BEDSIDE AND THEIR TEARS AND SOBS CAME NOW WITHOUT RESTRAINT
LAURA WAS AT CHURCH ALONE THAT DAY AND MR BRIERLY WALKED HOME WITH HER
BLESS YOUR SOULS WE'LL MAKE YOU THINK YOU NEVER WAS AT HOME BEFORE--'DEED AND DEED WE WILL I CAN TELL YOU
MR BOLTON'S AFFAIRS COULD NOT WAIT FOR INDICATIONS THE FUTURE MIGHT HAVE A GREAT DEAL IN STORE BUT THE PRESENT WAS BLACK AND HOPELESS
THE COLONEL WAS AT BREAKFAST
AND THERE WE STRIKE COLUMBUS RIVER--PASS ME TWO OR THREE SKEINS OF THREAD TO STAND FOR THE RIVER
RUTH IS VERY ILL CHAPTER LXIII
A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BUSH
I MUST HAVE HIS HEARTY CO-OPERATION AS WELL AS HIS VOTE
IT WAS A LETTER FROM LOUISE GOOD
WHENEVER SHE HALTED SHE WAS PRESENTLY SURROUNDED BY MINISTERS GENERALS CONGRESSMEN AND ALL MANNER OF ARISTOCRATIC PEOPLE
CHAPTER XLIX
AH
AH
SELLERS NAMELY THAT SUCH MEN DINED AT THEIR HOUSE EVERY WEEK
THE APPROPRIATION DID NOT COME
AND SO WHAT WAS BEGINNING AS A MERE INQUEST MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT
BUT NOW IF SOCIETY HAD TURNED ON HER SHE WOULD DEFY IT
NOBODY IN HAWKEYE HAD READ SO MUCH OR AFTER A FASHION STUDIED SO DILIGENTLY AS LAURA
SHE'LL STRIKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NOW WITHOUT STOPPING,--YOU'LL SEE
THEN THE TOWN DIGNITARIES HAD THEIR SAY
PERHAPS A THOUSAND TIMES HE HAD HEARD THE REMARK ILIUM FUIT FOLLOWED IN MOST INSTANCES BY A HAIL TO HIMSELF AS AENEAS WITH THE INQUIRY WHERE IS OLD ANCHISES AT FIRST HE HAD REPLIED DERE AIN'T NO SUCH MAN BUT IRRITATED BY ITS SENSELESS REPETITION HE HAD LATTERLY DROPPED INTO THE FORMULA OF YOU BE DAM PHILIP WAS RECALLED FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF ILIUM BY THE ROLLING AND GROWLING OF THE GONG WITHIN THE HOTEL THE DIN AND CLAMOR INCREASING TILL THE HOUSE WAS APPARENTLY UNABLE TO CONTAIN IT
BUT BEING ON HORSEBACK HE HAD THE ADVANTAGE
AND AGAIN SHE THREATENED HIM AND REPROACHED HIM
IT DID NOT OCCUR TO THE CITIZENS THAT BRAINS WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS LUCK
IT SEEMS THAT THEY HAD GOT HOLD OF THE DRY-GOODS BOX PACKING STORY ABOUT BALLOON ONE DAY AND WERE TALKING IT OVER WHEN THE COLONEL CAME IN
WASHINGTON WAS AS MUCH IN THE DARK AS ANYBODY WITH REGARD TO THE GREAT WEALTH THAT WAS HOVERING IN THE AIR AND SEEMINGLY ON THE POINT OF TUMBLING INTO THE FAMILY POCKET
I THINK RUTH WHEN I DIE SAID PHILIP INTENDING TO BE VERY GRIM AND SARCASTIC I'LL LEAVE YOU MY SKELETON
SHE CAME TO IT AS AN ORIGINAL PROPOSITION FOUNDED ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF HER OWN NATURE
FOR INSTANCE WHEN A LADY OF ANY PROMINENCE COMES TO ONE OF OUR CITIES AND TAKES UP HER RESIDENCE ALL THE LADIES OF HER GRADE FAVOR HER IN TURN WITH AN INITIAL CALL GIVING THEIR CARDS TO THE SERVANT AT THE DOOR BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION
BUT SO HIGH-BRED SO PICTURESQUE
IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO MAKE A MEMORANDUM OF THIS TRANSACTION
MRS HAWKINS WOULD HAVE TOLD THE FIRST INQUIRER THAT
BUT THE NEXT MOMENT THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE WAS HIMSELF AGAIN AND EXCLAIMED
HE AND MR BRIERLY TOOK THE SENATOR OVER TO NAPOLEON AND OPENED TO HIM THEIR PLAN
AND NOW ITS BATTERS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE--AND NOW THE VICE PRESIDENT
AS SHE READ THESE PASSIONATE THESE WORSHIPING THESE SUPPLICATING MISSIVES THE WOMAN IN HER NATURE CONFESSED ITSELF
THIS WAS THE ARRIVAL AT THE SASSACUA HOTEL OF TWO YOUNG GENTLEMEN FROM THE WEST
IT WOULD BE AT LEAST SINGULAR IN YOU TO SAY TO THE PROPOSED CONVEYOR YOU MIGHT BE ROBBED
THEY COURTED THE FULLEST AND FREEST DISCUSSION
SOME SAY IT IS A SORT OF VACCINATION THAT RENDERS DEATH BY SOME MALIGNANT TYPE OF FEVER LESS PROBABLE
NO AMARANTH IN SIGHT
YOU SHOULD BE A WINTER IN WASHINGTON HARRY SAID
YOU REMEMBER HIS SAYING THAT DAUGHTER YES OFTEN MOTHER
NOW HERE FOR INSTANCE
THE YOUNG FELLOWS LIKED THE HOUSE AND LIKED THE CITY
EVERY INDIVIDUAL ARRIVED WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
HE'LL BE BACK HERE TOMORROW SURE AND TAKE MY OFFER
THEY THREW THEMSELVES UPON MR BRAHAM IN A TRANSPORT OF GRATITUDE
GEORGE WASHINGTON HAWKINS MILLIONAIRE--AND GOV
THEY COULD AFFORD TO MIND THEIR OWN AFFAIRS AND LEAVE OTHER COMBINATIONS TO DO THE SAME OR DO OTHERWISE JUST AS THEY CHOSE
THERE WAS MOURNING IN ANOTHER QUARTER TOO FOR LOUISE HAD A LETTER
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS SERIOUSLY AFFECTED
NO HE SAID I HAVEN'T NOTICED MUCH
WHAH WAS YO EYES
HAVE YOU ANY FRIEND WHOM YOU WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT WITH A SALARIED OR UNSALARIED POSITION IN OUR INSTITUTION WELL I HAVE A BROTHER-IN-LAW THAT SAME OLD BROTHER-IN-LAW YOU GOOD UNSELFISH PROVIDER
BUT HE DID NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO CHAFE AT THE THOUGHT FOR HE REASONED THAT HIS FATHER HAD DEALT BY HIM WITH A FREE HAND AND A LOVING ONE ALL HIS LIFE AND NOW THAT HARD FORTUNE HAD BROKEN HIS SPIRIT IT OUGHT TO BE A PLEASURE NOT A PAIN TO WORK FOR HIM
THE TIME HILDEBRAND WAS SO LOW WITH THE PNEUMONIA EMMELINE AND ME WERE ALL ALONE WITH HIM MOST OF THE TIME AND WE NEVER TOOK A MINUTE'S SLEEP FOR AS MUCH AS TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS
SHE WAS BEWILDERED HER STRENGTH WAS FORSAKING HER
A HIGH MORAL CONGRESSMAN OR SENATOR HERE AND THERE--THE HIGH MORAL ONES COST MORE BECAUSE THEY
AND SANTO DOMINGO
YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID TO TELL ME NO--I--I AM AFRAID YOU CAN NOT THEN DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH ME--HELP THOSE THAT CAN GET WELL BUT HELP THOSE THAT CAN GET WELL
COME NOW DON'T EAT HIM UP--FINISH HIM IN THE HOUSE
AND IT ONLY COSTS A TRIFLE
HE MEANS MISCHIEF SURE
IN THE WOODS WERE FOUND THE COON THE OPOSSUM THE FOX THE DEER AND MANY OTHER ANIMALS WHO ROAMED IN THE DOMAIN OF NATURAL HISTORY
THE BIRDS SANG IT THE TREES WHISPERED IT TO HER AS SHE PASSED THE VERY FLOWERS BENEATH HER FEET STREWED THE WAY AS FOR A BRIDAL MARCH
OUTSIDERS HAD TAKEN UP INVENTION ALSO
SHE MAY HAVE HAD EXPERIENCES OF WHICH I AM IGNORANT BUT SHE COULD NOT HAVE GONE TO THIS EXTREMITY IF SHE HAD BEEN IN HER OWN RIGHT MIND TO THE SENATOR'S CREDIT BE IT SAID HE WAS WILLING TO HELP LAURA AND HER FAMILY IN THIS DREADFUL TRIAL
LET HER COME THE BOAT SPRANG AWAY FROM THE BANK LIKE A DEER AND DARTED IN A LONG DIAGONAL TOWARD THE OTHER SHORE
HE PICKED UP A PIECE OF RUBBISH CAST OUT BY THE LAST BLAST AND SAID
PHILIP WAS NOT A PHILOSOPHER TO BE SURE BUT HE HAD THE OLD FASHIONED NOTION THAT WHATEVER A WOMAN'S THEORIES OF LIFE MIGHT BE SHE WOULD COME ROUND TO MATRIMONY ONLY GIVE HER TIME
AND THE CLOTHING ALTHOUGH NEAT AND CLEAN SHOWED MANY EVIDENCES OF HAVING SEEN LONG SERVICE
MR NOBLE APPEARED BEFORE THE COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE
I WAS REALLY MORTIFIED THE OTHER DAY AT DINNER TO SEE BLACQUE BEY LEAVE HIS STANDING IN THE GLASSES WHEN THE COLONEL FIRST CAME TO WASHINGTON HE HAD THOUGHTS OF TAKING THE MISSION TO CONSTANTINOPLE IN ORDER TO BE ON THE SPOT TO LOOK AFTER THE DISSEMINATION OF HIS EYE WATER BUT AS THAT INVENTION
I'VE MADE HIM ENGAGE TO LET THE TENNESSEE LAND BILL UTTERLY ALONE IMPOSSIBLE
HE MOVED A RECONSIDERATION OF THE VOTE BY WHICH THE BILL HAD PASSED
IN OUR CITIES THE WARD MEETINGS ELECT DELEGATES TO THE NOMINATING CONVENTIONS AND INSTRUCT THEM WHOM TO NOMINATE
AND HE SHOULD ALTOGETHER DESPAIR IF HE DID NOT SEE BEFORE HIM A JURY OF TWELVE MEN OF RARE INTELLIGENCE WHOSE ACUTE MINDS WOULD UNRAVEL ALL THE SOPHISTRIES OF THE PROSECUTION MEN WITH A SENSE OF HONOR WHICH WOULD REVOLT AT THE REMORSELESS PERSECUTION OF THIS HUNTED WOMAN BY THE STATE MEN WITH HEARTS TO FEEL FOR THE WRONGS OF WHICH SHE WAS THE VICTIM
WHY OF COURSE YOU MAY HAVE OVERHEARD SOME SUCH JESTING NONSENSE
LET US GIVE IT ALL UP
FOR SHE COULD SCARCELY CONCEIVE OF A LIFE THAT SHOULD NOT BE DEVOTED TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SOME DEFINITE WORK AND SHE HAD NO DOUBT THAT IN HER OWN CASE EVERYTHING ELSE WOULD YIELD TO THE PROFESSIONAL CAREER SHE HAD MARKED OUT
IT WAS SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES
YOU ARE AS SOLEMN AS THE UPPER BENCH IN MEETING
HIS LIABILITY TO BE SUDDENLY SUMMONED TO WASHINGTON OR BOSTON OR MONTREAL OR EVEN TO LIVERPOOL WAS ALWAYS IMMINENT
MR BRAHAM AGAIN SWEPT HIS EYES OVER THE HOUSE AS IF IN APPROVAL
BY AND BY HE WAS ELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE--THEN HE DID EVERYTHING HE COULD FOR SUNDAY SCHOOLS
WHERE'S THE GLASS HE TOOK IT AND LOOKED
HE MADE THAT EXPOSURE AS ALL THE WORLD KNEW
YOU DID NOT SELL YOUR VOTE--YOU ONLY ACCEPTED A LITTLE TRIFLE A SMALL TOKEN OF ESTEEM FOR YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW
SOME REGARD IT AS A SORT OF INITIATION LIKE THAT INTO THE ODD FELLOWS WHICH RENDERS ONE LIABLE TO HIS REGULAR DUES THEREAFTER
IT WAS A PLEASURE
TIME TO REPORT PROGRESS FROM THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE AND THE SENATOR BEAMED WITH HIS OWN CONGRESSIONAL WIT
SHE SAY SHE WASN'T GWYNE TO HANG OUT IN NO SICH A DERN HOLE LIKE A HOG
SELBY'S DYING STATEMENT
A MAN IS TO PAY OUR FAMILY $40,000 FOR THE TENNESSEE LAND
YOU THREW AWAY THIS CHANCE YOU LET THIS MAN GO AND WE IN THIS AWFUL TROUBLE
WE'VE ALL BEEN WORRIED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT HIM
ORE
THAT COMES OF NOT DOING A THING YOURSELF
NEVER TAKE AN INFERIOR LIQUOR GENTLEMEN NOT IN THE EVENING IN THIS CLIMATE
HAD HE NOT TACITLY AGREED TO SHARE WITH HARRY TO THE LAST IN THIS ADVENTURE AND WOULD NOT THE GENEROUS FELLOW DIVIDE WITH HIM IF HE PHILIP WERE IN WANT AND HARRY HAD ANYTHING
YOUR RECEPTIONS ARE ALWAYS DELIGHTFUL SHE SAID TO THAT LADY THE PLEASANT PEOPLE ALL SEEM TO COME HERE IT'S PLEASANT TO HEAR YOU SAY SO MISS HAWKINS
AND COUSIN HULDA ADDED THAT SHE ALWAYS THOUGHT RUTH WAS FOND OF ADMIRATION AND THAT WAS THE REASON SHE WAS UNWILLING TO WEAR PLAIN CLOTHES AND ATTEND MEETING
THEE WILL FIND THAT LOVE RUTH IS A THING THEE WON'T REASON ABOUT WHEN IT COMES NOR MAKE ANY BARGAINS ABOUT
WITHIN A MINUTE SHE WAS BACK AGAIN WITH A BUSINESS-LOOKING STRANGER WHOM SHE SEATED AND THEN SHE TOOK HER LEAVE AGAIN
THE HAWKINS FAMILY WERE SETTLED THERE AND HAD A HARD ENOUGH STRUGGLE WITH POVERTY AND THE NECESSITY OF KEEPING UP APPEARANCES IN ACCORD WITH THEIR OWN FAMILY PRIDE AND THE LARGE EXPECTATIONS THEY SECRETLY CHERISHED OF A FORTUNE IN THE KNOBS OF EAST TENNESSEE
THE LADY ATTEMPTED IT BUT LOST HER BALANCE IN THE WIND AND THE MOTION OF THE CAR AND FELL
BUT HE HAD AMBITION AND NATIVE SHREWDNESS AND HE SPEEDILY TOOK TO BOOT-POLISHING AND NEWSPAPER HAWKING BECAME THE OFFICE AND ERRAND BOY OF A LAW FIRM PICKED UP KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH TO GET SOME EMPLOYMENT IN POLICE COURTS WAS ADMITTED TO THE BAR BECAME A RISING YOUNG POLITICIAN WENT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS FINALLY ELECTED TO THE BENCH WHICH HE NOW HONORED
THEY'RE MIGHTY SUSTAINING--BRIM FULL OF NUTRIMENT--ALL THE MEDICAL BOOKS SAY SO
THAT ONCE RARE AND AWE-INSPIRING BEING A CONGRESSMAN WAS BECOME A COMMON SPECTACLE--A SPECTACLE SO COMMON INDEED THAT HE COULD CONTEMPLATE IT WITHOUT EXCITEMENT EVEN WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT
SEARCH EVEN FOR THEIR BODIES IS IN VAIN
HE FAINTED AND DID NOT REVIVE AGAIN
SUCH A HEAD
DR LONGSTREET TOLD PHILIP THAT THE FEVER HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN CONTRACTED IN THE HOSPITAL BUT IT WAS NOT MALIGNANT AND WOULD BE LITTLE DANGEROUS IF RUTH WERE NOT SO WORN DOWN WITH WORK OR IF SHE HAD A LESS DELICATE CONSTITUTION
I TOLD YOU
TO-MORROW WE CAN SEND A MILLION TO NEW YORK AND SET THE LAWYERS AT WORK ON THE JUDGES
HE SAID THAT ITS PROVISIONS WERE SIMPLE
AND ON ONE SIDE THE GARDEN SLOPED AWAY IN UNDULATIONS TO A SHALLOW BROOK THAT RAN OVER A PEBBLY BOTTOM AND SANG UNDER FOREST TREES
I ALLOW THISH-YERS THE RAILROAD I HEERN IT WAS A-COMIN YES THIS IS THE RAILROAD
AND WE SHALL DOUBTLESS LEARN IN DUE TIME THAT IF SHE WAS NOT AS MAD AS A HARE IN THIS MONTH OF MARCH SHE WAS AT LEAST LABORING UNDER WHAT IS TERMED MOMENTARY INSANITY IT WOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT UPON THE FIRST PUBLICATION OF THE FACTS OF THE TRAGEDY THERE WAS AN ALMOST UNIVERSAL FEELING OF RAGE AGAINST THE MURDERESS IN THE TOMBS AND THAT REPORTS OF HER BEAUTY ONLY HEIGHTENED THE INDIGNATION
SELLERS AND WASHINGTON STEPPED OUT OF THE BUILDING THEY WERE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE DAYLIGHT WAS OLD AND THE SUN WELL UP
I SAW HIM LOOKING AT THE PRISONER SYMPATHIZINGLY
HE STEPPED QUICKLY TO HER GRASPED BOTH HER HANDS IN HIS AND SAID LAURA STOP
BUT THE COLONEL WOULD NOT
SHE JEST WENT AROUND BROKEN-HEARTED LIKE AND NEVER TOOK NO INTRUST IN ANYTHING BUT CLAY--THAT'S THE BOY THAR
LET US GO HOME AT ONCE MOTHER REPLIED LAURA SPEAKING WITH SOME TENDERNESS I CANNOT GO WITH YOU
HER COUNTENANCE HAD CLEARED
RUTH REPLIED TO PHILIP'S LETTER IN DUE TIME AND IN THE MOST CORDIAL AND UNSENTIMENTAL MANNER
THERE IS NO STATE COMMISSION OF LUNACY
THERE IS WHERE THE MYSTERY LIES BUT I WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT
THE NEXT EVENING AT MRS GLOVERSON'S PARTY SHE SAID TO MR BUCKSTONE
HE CHEERED THE HEART OF THE WORTHY AND ZEALOUS MINISTER BY AN EXPRESSION OF HIS SYMPATHY IN HIS LABORS AND BY MANY INQUIRIES IN REGARD TO THE RELIGIOUS STATE OF THE REGION
OH DO NOT SPEAK
FROM TIME TO TIME AS FORTUNE SMILED THE ELDER CHILDREN GOT THE BENEFIT OF IT SPENDING THE LUCKY SEASONS AT EXCELLENT SCHOOLS IN ST LOUIS AND THE UNLUCKY ONES AT HOME IN THE CHAFING DISCOMFORT OF STRAIGHTENED CIRCUMSTANCES
THERE WAS NO MORE SLEEP FOR THEM THAT NIGHT
A LITTLE EXTRA TO ONE OR TWO CHAIRMAN OF ONE OR TWO SUCH COMMITTEES SAY $10,000 EACH--$20,000
NOW SHE SAID YOU WILL KNOW WHETHER THIS IS THE HANDWRITING OR NOT
IF THE MEASURE WENT THROUGH LOVE COULD AFFORD TO RIPEN INTO MARRIAGE AND LONGING FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL WOULD HAVE FRUITION
HE WOULD ONLY HAVE A WIDER SCOPE TO INJURE HIMSELF
A MAN STILL LINGERING AMONG THE COBWEBS OF THE PAST AND BEHIND THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE
AND WHEN A PERSON ASKS OF HER COAL SHE IS QUITE APT TO REQUIRE GOLD IN EXCHANGE
YES I WOULD HAVE EXPOSED HIM
IT WAS EVENING WHEN PHILIP TOOK THE CARS AT THE ILIUM STATION
NOW THINGS WERE BLOOMING AND PLEASANT AGAIN BUT THE MEN HAD NO MONEY AND NOTHING TO LIVE ON
INSTEAD OF THIS WITH ONLY A SMATTERING OF CIVIL ENGINEERING HE IS AT HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE FRETTING AND FUMING OVER HIS ILL-LUCK AND THE HARDNESS AND DISHONESTY OF MEN AND THINKING OF NOTHING BUT HOW TO GET THE COAL OUT OF THE ILIUM HILLS
IF SHE WAS SEEMING TO BE WHAT SHE WAS NOT AND CARRYING A BURDEN HEAVIER THAN ANY ONE ELSE CARRIED BECAUSE SHE HAD TO BEAR IT ALONE SHE WAS ONLY DOING WHAT THOUSANDS OF WOMEN DO WITH A SELF-RENUNCIATION AND HEROISM OF WHICH MEN IMPATIENT AND COMPLAINING HAVE NO CONCEPTION
BUT PRESENTLY THE PERVADING GOSSIP FOUND ITS WAY TO HER AND SHE UNDERSTOOD THEM--THEN
DAT MEAN BUSINESS HONEY
I RECKON YOU DIDN'T GIT THEM BOOTS NO WHER'S THIS SIDE O SENT LOUIS QUERIED THE TALL MISSOURI YOUTH WHO ACTED AS COMMISSARY'S ASSISTANT
HE WAS A VERY CHARMING MAN BUT VERY ECCENTRIC
WAS THIS THE PLAIN FAMILY DINNER
BALLOON IS A MAN WE KNOW AND CAN DEPEND ON TO BE TRUE TO HIMSELF YES AND BALLOON HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL OF PUBLIC EXPERIENCE
ASKED WHAT NOBLE'S FIGURE WAS
HE WENT TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE
THE DOCTOR RECOMMENDED BAKED APPLE AND SPOILED MEAT AND I THINK IT DONE HIM GOOD
PART 4
THE STORES AND HOTELS THAT WALL IN THIS BROAD AVENUE ARE MEAN AND CHEAP AND DINGY AND ARE BETTER LEFT WITHOUT COMMENT
A LITTLE WEE FRENCH MIDSHIPMAN OF FOURTEEN LAY FEARFULLY INJURED BUT NEVER UTTERED A SOUND TILL A PHYSICIAN OF MEMPHIS WAS ABOUT TO DRESS HIS HURTS
BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TO DO WITH SELBY LAURA CONTINUED HARRY FANCYING THAT HE WAS NOW UPON SUCH TERMS THAT HIS ADVICE WOULD BE HEEDED
AND AFTER THAT HE USED TO ANALYZE HIS GOOD THINGS WITH A DEAL OF COMFORT AND FIND IN THEM A BRILLIANCY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN UNAPPARENT TO HIM IN EARLIER DAYS--AND THEN HE WOULD MAKE A NOTE OF THAT GOOD THING AND SAY IT AGAIN THE FIRST TIME HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A NEW COMPANY
HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH A BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE CASE
PHILIP WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING THAT PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON DID NOT DIFFER MUCH FROM OTHER PEOPLE
THE LAND THAT PHILIP HAD COME TO LOOK AT WAS AT LEAST FIVE MILES DISTANT FROM ILIUM STATION
THE TIRED CHILD WAS ASLEEP IN THE ARMS OF MRS HAWKINS
HE WILL FIND THAT A WOMAN'S HATE DOESN'T FORGET
DON'T YOU BOTHER ABOUT THE SENATE
BUT BYMEBY SHE ROUSED UP LIKE AND LOOKED AROUND WILD AND THEN SHE SEE HIM AND SHE MADE A GREAT CRY AND SNATCHED HIM TO HER BREAST AND HILT HIM CLOSE AND KISSED HIM OVER AND OVER AGIN
BASE IT ON EVERYTHING
YOU KNOW SELBY HAS GOT HIS CLAIM ALLOWED AND THEY SAY HE HAS HAD A RUN OF LUCK LATELY AT MORRISSEY'S LAURA HEARD ALL THIS IN A KIND OF STUPOR LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HARRY WITHOUT SEEING HIM
I SUBMIT YOUR HONOR THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO ESTABLISH THE RELATION OF THIS UNWILLING WITNESS TO THE PRISONER ADMITTED
THUS AS THE WEEKS ROLLED ON WASHINGTON GREW UP INTO AN IMPOSING LION ONCE MORE BUT A LION THAT ROAMED THE PEACEFUL FIELDS OF RELIGION AND TEMPERANCE AND REVISITED THE GLITTERING DOMAIN OF FASHION NO MORE
BUT THAT SHEET OF PAPER IS OUT OF MY REACH--SHE WILL NEVER LET THAT GET OUT OF HER HANDS
SOME OF THE MINERS SAID THAT THEY SHOULD PROBABLY GO THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN AND THAT THE HOLE COULD BE USED FOR A RAILWAY TUNNEL
WE TOOK IT TO BE THAT DID YOU FROM THE FIRST I CAN'T SAY WE DID AT FIRST
I WISH IT WAS ALL OVER AND WE COULD REST
22.  THE HAPPY WIFE 23.  LAURA 24.  READY TO SELL 25.  STOCK RISING 26.  A FAMILY COUNCIL 27.  TAIL PIECE 28.  ATTEMPTED CORNER IN SPECIE 29.  A BRILLIANT IDEA 30.  BIG THINGS SHOWN UP 31.  COL
HE SAID IT OUGHT TO BE THE NATIONAL CAPITAL
AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IF HE COULD COMPEL HER TO RECOGNIZE HER POSITION AND HIS OWN DEVOTION SHE MIGHT LOVE HIM AND THAT HE COULD SAVE HER
AND MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD BUY PROVISIONS WITH THE TRIFLE OF MONEY THUS GAINED AND CONTINUE HIS WORK ALONE
HER COMPANION IS MR HARRY BRIERLY A NEW YORK DANDY WHO HAS BEEN IN WASHINGTON
HE WOULD MAKE IT PAY ROUNDLY
IN A FEW MOMENTS THE CONDUCTOR ENTERED AND WITHOUT WAITING AN EXPLANATION SAID ROUGHLY TO THE LADY NOW YOU CAN'T SIT THERE
YOU'D RATHER SIT HERE IN FRONT THAN GO TO MY APARTMENTS
THE DRUDGERY OF THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE WAS TOO DISTASTEFUL AND BESIDES IT WOULD BE BENEATH THE DIGNITY OF A GRADUATE AND A SUCCESSFUL MAGAZINE WRITER
BUT I AM NOT CONQUERED
FINALLY MRS HAWKINS SAID
IN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES
AND THEN THE GREAT MEEK PUBLIC COME FORWARD AT THE PROPER TIME AND MAKE UNHAMPERED CHOICE AND BLESS HEAVEN THAT THEY LIVE IN A FREE LAND WHERE NO FORM OF DESPOTISM CAN EVER INTRUDE
BUT INASMUCH AS THE MAN WAS NOT FOUND AFTER ALL IT DID NOT SEEM WISE TO HARASS AND EXCITE THE READER TO NO PURPOSE
MR BIGLER HAD NO IDEA THAT HE HAD NOT MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION ON THE WHOLE FAMILY
COMING OUT OF THE SWEET SANITY OF THE BOLTON HOUSEHOLD THIS WAS BY CONTRAST THE MADDEST VANITY FAIR ONE COULD CONCEIVE
THE $7,000 LEFT BY MR NOBLE WITH HIS STATE LEGISLATURE WAS PLACED IN SAFE KEEPING TO AWAIT THE CLAIM OF THE LEGITIMATE OWNER
GOVERNMENT OF PERFECTLY HIMMALAYAN OFFICIAL ALTITUDE TO WRITE UP OUR LITTLE INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT FOR A RELIGIOUS PAPER OF ENORMOUS CIRCULATION--I TELL YOU THAT MAKES OUR BONDS GO HANDSOMELY AMONG THE PIOUS POOR
THEY TRAVELED ALL ABOUT TURNING THEIR NOSES UP AT EVERY THING AND NOT FINDING IT A DIFFICULT THING TO DO EITHER BECAUSE NATURE HAD ORIGINALLY GIVEN THOSE FEATURES A CAST IN THAT DIRECTION
THAT WILL MAKE ANOTHER MOUTH LESS TO FEED
MY LITTLE FRIENDS--FOR I HOPE THAT ALL THESE BRIGHT-FACED LITTLE PEOPLE ARE MY FRIENDS AND WILL LET ME BE THEIR FRIEND--MY LITTLE FRIENDS I HAVE TRAVELED MUCH I HAVE BEEN IN MANY CITIES AND MANY STATES EVERYWHERE IN OUR GREAT AND NOBLE COUNTRY AND BY THE BLESSING OF PROVIDENCE I HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO SEE MANY GATHERINGS LIKE THIS--BUT I AM PROUD I AM TRULY PROUD TO SAY THAT I NEVER HAVE LOOKED UPON SO MUCH INTELLIGENCE SO MUCH GRACE SUCH SWEETNESS OF DISPOSITION AS I SEE IN THE CHARMING YOUNG COUNTENANCES I SEE BEFORE ME AT THIS MOMENT
TAMPED IT DOWN FIRMLY TOUCHED HIS CANDLE TO THE FUSE AND RAN
HE DON'T MEAN ANYTHING BY COMING TO THE HOUSE EVERY EVENING--ONLY COMES TO SEE MOTHER
EVERYBODY SMOKED IN THE STREETS FOR ONE THING THEY NOTICED
I WAS ONLY THINKING AS TO THIS APPROPRIATION NOW WHAT SUCH A WOMAN COULD DO IN WASHINGTON
THE ALMIGHTY NEVER LAID OUT A CLEANER PIECE OF LEVEL PRAIRIE FOR A CITY
BLESS ME SAID THE COLONEL
FATIGUE HAD MADE HIM SLEEP LATE
A WEEK HAD PASSED SINCE THE TRIAL OPENED
LONG BEFORE THEY GOT THERE THE NEWSBOYS WERE RUNNING AHEAD OF THEM WITH EXTRAS HOT FROM THE PRESS ANNOUNCING THE ASTOUNDING NEWS
YOU'LL NEVER DIG IT OUT OF THE ASTOR LIBRARY IF THERE BE ANY PLACE AND TIME IN THE WORLD WHERE AND WHEN IT SEEMS EASY TO GO INTO SOMETHING IT IS IN BROADWAY ON A SPRING MORNING WHEN ONE IS WALKING CITY-WARD AND HAS BEFORE HIM THE LONG LINES OF PALACE-SHOPS WITH AN OCCASIONAL SPIRE SEEN THROUGH THE SOFT HAZE THAT LIES OVER THE LOWER TOWN AND HEARS THE ROAR AND HUM OF ITS MULTITUDINOUS TRAFFIC
WHEN THE OTHER CHILDREN AND THE MOTHER REALIZED THAT DEATH WAS INDEED COME AT LAST THEY THREW THEMSELVES INTO EACH OTHERS ARMS AND GAVE WAY TO A FRENZY OF GRIEF
THEY TALKED AN HOUR AND THEN MR BUCKSTONE CAME BACK AND SAID
THE WEATHER HAS BEEN UNPROPITIOUS OF LATE MISS HAWKINS IT HAS INDEED SAID LAURA
WHEN THE LETTER WAS DONE WASHINGTON AND THE COLONEL SALLIED FORTH AND AS THEY WALKED ALONG WASHINGTON LEARNED WHAT HE WAS TO BE
MR BIGLER CAME TO DINNER WITH HER FATHER NEXT DAY AND TALKED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MR BOLTON'S MAGNIFICENT TRACT OF LAND EXTOLLED THE SAGACITY THAT LED HIM TO SECURE SUCH A PROPERTY AND LED THE TALK ALONG TO ANOTHER RAILROAD WHICH WOULD OPEN A NORTHERN COMMUNICATION TO THIS VERY LAND
DEPARTING FROM THESE POINTS SHE REGULARLY CROSSED THE RIVER EVERY FIVE MILES AVOIDING THE BIGHT OF THE GREAT BINDS AND THUS ESCAPING THE STRONG CURRENT
THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY MYSTERIOUS IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
THERE WERE SHOWY COATS OF ARMS TOO WITH LATIN MOTTOES
IT SHOWS THAT A MAN CAN'T BE CORRUPT IN THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT SWEATING FOR IT I CAN TELL YOU THAT HANG IT COLONEL YOU JUST SAID WE NEVER PUNISH ANYBODY FOR VILLAINOUS PRACTICES BUT GOOD GOD WE TRY THEM DON'T WE
OPPORTUNITIES FOR A FORTUNE HE DID NOT DOUBT EXISTED IN MISSOURI BUT FOR HIMSELF HE SAW NO BETTER MEANS FOR LIVELIHOOD THAN THE MASTERY OF THE PROFESSION HE HAD RATHER THOUGHTLESSLY ENTERED UPON
HE MOVED INSTANTLY TO WASHINGTON AND DEMANDED AN INVESTIGATION EVEN THIS COULD NOT PASS WITHOUT COMMENT
HE SPENT A MONTH IN TRAVELING OVER THE LAND AND MAKING CALCULATIONS
DID YOU SEE HIS WIFE YES
HE HADN'T A PIECE OF REAL ESTATE THAT WAS NOT COVERED WITH MORTGAGES EVEN TO THE WILD TRACT WHICH PHILIP WAS EXPERIMENTING ON AND WHICH HAD NO MARKETABLE VALUE ABOVE THE INCUMBRANCE ON IT
NIGHT DOESN'T LAST ALWAYS
I WONDER IF HE HATES ME AS I DO HIM SO LAURA RAVED IN TEARS AND IN RAGE BY TURNS TOSSED IN A TUMULT OF PASSION WHICH SHE GAVE WAY TO WITH LITTLE EFFORT TO CONTROL
THE CONVERSATION WAS NOW FINELY UNDER WAY
WE'LL GET A MAP NEVER MIND THE MAP
I ASK YOU MY LITTLE FRIENDS WHAT DID MY CONSCIOUSNESS REPLY
ANY OTHER COURSE WOULD BE FATAL IT SEEMED THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE

WELCOME MY BOY TO A MANSION THAT IS PROUD TO SHELTER THE SON OF THE BEST MAN THAT WALKS ON THE GROUND
THERE IS SOMETHING GOOD AND MOTHERLY ABOUT WASHINGTON THE GRAND OLD BENEVOLENT NATIONAL ASYLUM FOR THE HELPLESS
THERE WERE MORE INTERESTS AT STAKE THAN IT COULD HANDLE WITH SERENITY
ALL HIS OWN SCHEMES TOOK LARGER SHAPE AND MORE MISTY AND MAJESTIC PROPORTIONS
SO WASHINGTON'S MIND WAS IN A STATE OF TURMOIL
WE WANT A CANAL FROM THE JAMES RIVER TO THE MISSISSIPPI
PHILIP WANTED TIME TO LOOK ABOUT HIM BEFORE HE DECIDED WHAT TO DO
MENTION FACTS AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO BUT DON'T MENTION NAMES TO ANYBODY
IT THEREFORE SUITED THE WISHES OF ALL CONCERNED WHEN AUTUMN CAME THAT RUTH SHOULD GO AWAY TO SCHOOL
HARRY DID NOT NEGLECT TO ENDEAVOR TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO MRS BOLTON BY PAYING GREAT ATTENTION TO THE CHILDREN AND BY PROFESSING THE WARMEST INTEREST IN THE FRIENDS FAITH
THE IGNORANT WILL IMAGINE IT TO BE INTENDED FOR A COMPLIMENT
LET'S GIVE UP EVERYTHING AND DIE DIE AND LEAVE THE DUCHESS TO FIGHT IT OUT ALL ALONE
WASHINGTON MY BOY WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN YOU GET TO BE ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN IN THE WORLD I DON'T KNOW FATHER
BUT LET THE FIGHT PROCEED THE VOTING BEGAN AND EVERY SOUND CEASED BUT THE CALLING IF THE NAMES AND THE AYE NO NO AYE OF THE RESPONSES
THE MOMENT THE FLOOR WAS UNOCCUPIED MR BUCKSTONE ROSE WITH AN INJURED LOOK AND SAID IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL WERE MERELY TALKING AGAINST TIME HOPING IN THIS UNBECOMING WAY TO TIRE OUT THE FRIENDS OF THE MEASURE AND SO DEFEAT IT
YOU'LL FIND IT NOT BAD IN CAMP HE CRIED OUT AS THE PLANK WAS HAULED IN
I SUPPOSE YOU--YOU'LL STILL GO SI GO
HE SEEMED SATISFIED AS TO WASHINGTON'S ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THE BOOKS HE WAS EVIDENTLY A PRETTY FAIR THEORETICAL BOOKKEEPER AND EXPERIENCE WOULD SOON HARDEN THEORY INTO PRACTICE
I AM NOT ALONE IN THAT
SHE QUIETLY TOOK CHARGE OF HIM AND WITH A GENTLE FIRMNESS RESISTED ALL ATTEMPTS OF ALICE OR ANY ONE ELSE TO SHARE TO ANY GREAT EXTENT THE BURDEN WITH HER
HARRY SKIPPED INTO THIS SOCIETY WITH HIS USUAL LIGHTNESS AND GAIETY
WOULD THEE HAVE ME SIT HERE LIKE A BIRD ON A BOUGH AND WAIT FOR SOMEBODY TO COME AND PUT ME IN A CAGE MR BOLTON WAS NOT SORRY TO DIVERT THE TALK FROM HIS OWN AFFAIRS AND HE DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO TELL HIS FAMILY OF A PERFORMANCE THAT VERY DAY WHICH WAS ENTIRELY CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM
A LOT WITH FINE ORNAMENTAL SHRUBBERY AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
ALWAYS LOVE YOUR TEACHERS MY CHILDREN FOR THEY LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN KNOW NOW
THIS WAS THE MATERIAL VIEW AND THE LEAST IMPORTANT IN THE HONORABLE GENTLEMAN'S OPINION
BUT YOU HAD TROUBLE ENOUGH AND I WOULDN'T SAY A WORD--AND I WOULDN'T SAY A WORD NOW ONLY THINGS HAVE GOT SO BAD THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOR WHERE TO TURN AND SHE GAVE WAY AND PUT HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND CRIED
THEY CALLED AT HIS CABIN AND GAVE HIM GOOD-BYE BUT WERE NOT ABLE TO TELL HIM THEIR DAY'S EFFORT HAD GIVEN THINGS A MERE PROMISING LOOK
WELL WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THE POOR PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN LED TO PUT THEIR LITTLE MONEY INTO THE SPECULATION WHEN YOU GOT OUT OF IT AND LEFT IT HALF WAY IT WOULD BE NO MORE TRUE TO SAY OF MR BIGLER THAT HE WAS OR COULD BE EMBARRASSED THAN TO SAY THAT A BRASS COUNTERFEIT DOLLAR-PIECE WOULD CHANGE COLOR WHEN REFUSED
YOU ENTER WHAT THEY REGARD AS A CARRIAGE IN THE CAPITAL AND YOU WONDER WHY THEY DO NOT TAKE IT OUT OF SERVICE AND PUT IT IN THE MUSEUM
THIS HUMOROUS SALLY WAS RECEIVED WITH SMILING ADMIRATION--NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS NOT WHOLLY NEW HAVING ORIGINATED WITH THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL IN THE HOUSE A DAY OR TWO BEFORE UPON THE OCCASION OF THE PROPOSED EXPULSION OF A MEMBER FOR SELLING HIS VOTE FOR MONEY THE SENATE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT IT COULD NOT BE CONTAMINATED BY SITTING A FEW DAYS LONGER WITH SENATOR DILWORTHY AND SO IT ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT AND DROPPED THE UNIMPORTANT MATTER
ON IT LAY A SMALL MOROCCO SATCHEL ALSO MARKED G
WE MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING IN AVERTING ITS RUIN IN OUR RESOLUTE EXPOSURE OF THE GREAT FRAUDS
THE SCOUNDREL STILL LIVES AND DARES TO COME HERE
MR JEFF THOMPSON WAS THE MOST POPULAR ENGINEER WHO COULD BE FOUND FOR THIS WORK
HIS PRETENTIONS WERE EQUAL TO ANY HE ENCOUNTERED THERE
I CALLED TO SEE YOU ON BUSINESS MISS HAWKINS
WASHINGTON WE SEEM TO BE HOPELESSLY FALLEN HOPELESSLY INVOLVED
WE SOUTHERN GENTLEMEN DON'T CHANGE OUR WAYS YOU KNOW
AN HONEST HISTORIAN WHO HAD PROGRESSED THUS FAR AND TRACED EVERYTHING TO SUCH A CONDITION OF DISASTER AND SUSPENSION MIGHT WELL BE JUSTIFIED IN ENDING HIS NARRATIVE AND WRITING--"AFTER THIS THE DELUGE HIS ONLY CONSOLATION WOULD BE IN THE REFLECTION THAT HE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR EITHER CHARACTERS OR EVENTS
THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE WAS STRICKEN SPEECHLESS WITH DISMAY AND ASTONISHMENT
DO YOU LOOK UPON THEM AS I SUBJECTS DEAR SHE WOULD ASK
SELBY WAS INFORMED
OR HAVE A MACHINE LIKE THAT ONE YOU AND COLONEL SELLERS BOUGHT
ABOUT THE CHIEF CABIN WHICH WAS THE STORE AND GROCERY OF THIS MART OF TRADE THE MUD WAS MORE LIQUID THAN ELSEWHERE AND THE RUDE PLATFORM IN FRONT OF IT AND THE DRY-GOODS BOXES MOUNTED THEREON WERE PLACES OF REFUGE FOR ALL THE LOAFERS OF THE PLACE
AS MAY BE READILY BELIEVED COL
BEEN ON THE LOOK-OUT FOR YOU
THERE WERE THINGS THERE THAT MADE HIS BRAIN SWIM
BYE AND BYE THE CHILDREN QUIETED DOWN TO LISTEN
ALL DAY LONG THE FIGURE SAT THERE THE SUNSHINE ENRICHING ITS COSTLY RAIMENT AND FLASHING FROM ITS JEWELS
WASHINGTON WAS AT WORK IN THE REAL ESTATE OFFICE AGAIN AND WAS ALTERNATELY IN PARADISE OR THE OTHER PLACE JUST AS IT HAPPENED THAT LOUISE WAS GRACIOUS TO HIM OR SEEMINGLY INDIFFERENT--BECAUSE INDIFFERENCE OR PREOCCUPATION COULD MEAN NOTHING ELSE THAN THAT SHE WAS THINKING OF SOME OTHER YOUNG PERSON
QUESTIONS WERE ASKED ABOUT THE JOURNEY AND ABOUT THE WEST AND THE CONVERSATION BECAME A GENERAL ONE UNTIL PHILIP AT LENGTH FOUND HIMSELF TALKING WITH THE SQUIRE IN RELATION TO LAND AND RAILROADS AND THINGS HE COULDN'T KEEP HIS MIND ON ESPECIALLY AS HE HEARD RUTH AND HARRY IN AN ANIMATED DISCOURSE AND CAUGHT THE WORDS NEW YORK AND OPERA AND RECEPTION AND KNEW THAT HARRY WAS GIVING HIS IMAGINATION FULL RANGE IN THE WORLD OF FASHION
A MODERN DWELLING AND LUXURIOUS IN EVERYTHING THAT WEALTH COULD SUGGEST FOR COMFORT IT STOOD IN THE MIDST OF EXQUISITELY KEPT LAWNS WITH GROUPS OF TREES PARTERRES OF FLOWERS MASSED IN COLORS WITH GREENHOUSE GRAPERY AND GARDEN
THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE RATTLED OFF THIS OBSERVATION
I WILL TRY TO EXERT A LITTLE INFLUENCE IN FAVOR OF THE BILL ARRIVED AT HOME MR TROLLOP SAT DOWN AND THOUGHT IT ALL OVER--SOMETHING AFTER THIS FASHION
THE THIN LACE VAIL WHICH PARTIALLY COVERED HER FACE DID NOT SO MUCH CONCEAL AS HEIGHTEN HER BEAUTY
BUT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAD SIMPLY LOOKED SAD WHEN THEY HEARD THE NEWS EXCEPT LAURA
I EXPECT THE NEWS EVERY DAY NOW BUT BERIAH YOU'VE BEEN EXPECTING IT EVERY DAY ALL ALONG HAVEN'T YOU WELL YES
SHE LOOKED LONG AT THIS FOOLISH MEMENTO
ALL SHE WOULD SAY WAS
MRS HAWKINS TOOK THE STAND
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN SOCIETY HERE THAT HAVE REALLY NO MORE MONEY TO LIVE ON THAN WHAT SOME OF US PAY FOR SERVANT HIRE
LAURA
BUT THE AMARANTH'S HEAD WAS ALMOST ABREAST THE BOREAS'S STERN
THE LANDLORD AT ILIUM ENDEAVORED TO PERSUADE PHILIP TO HIRE THE SERVICES OF A WITCH-HAZEL PROFESSOR OF THAT REGION WHO COULD WALK OVER THE LAND WITH HIS WAND AND TELL HIM INFALLIBLY WHETHER IT CONTAINED COAL AND EXACTLY WHERE THE STRATA RAN
BUT YOUR BEAUTY MADE ME CRAZY
IN THE SCUFFLE HIS RAILWAY CHECK HAD DISAPPEARED AND HE GRIMLY WONDERED AS HE NOTICED THE LOSS IF THE COMPANY WOULD PERMIT HIM TO WALK OVER THEIR TRACK IF THEY SHOULD KNOW HE HADN'T A TICKET
HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY MISS HAWKINS I VOTED FOR THAT BILL BECAUSE WHEN I CAME TO EXAMINE INTO IT AH YES
WASHINGTON HAWKINS HAD SEEN THE ACT BUT WAS NOT NEAR ENOUGH AT HAND TO SAVE HIS FRIEND AND NO ONE WHO WAS NEAR ENOUGH DESIRED TO SPOIL THE EFFECT
AND THIS I SUPPOSE IS YOUR FRIEND I BEG YOUR PARDON PHILIP AT LENGTH BLUNDERED OUT THIS IS MR BRIERLY OF WHOM I HAVE WRITTEN YOU AND RUTH WELCOMED HARRY WITH A FRIENDLINESS THAT PHILIP THOUGHT WAS DUE TO HIS FRIEND TO BE SURE BUT WHICH SEEMED TO HIM TOO LEVEL WITH HER RECEPTION OF HIMSELF BUT WHICH HARRY RECEIVED AS HIS DUE FROM THE OTHER SEX
LAURA WENT TO HARDING THE NEIGHBORS SUPPOSED TO NURSE WASHINGTON WHO HAD FALLEN ILL THERE
WHEN LAURA AND THE SENATOR ARRIVED ABOUT HALF PAST NINE OR TEN IN THE EVENING THE PLACE WAS ALREADY PRETTY WELL CROWDED AND THE WHITE-GLOVED NEGRO SERVANT AT THE DOOR WAS STILL RECEIVING STREAMS OF GUESTS.--THE DRAWING-ROOMS WERE BRILLIANT WITH GASLIGHT AND AS HOT AS OVENS
IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY FOR THE CONVEYOR TO GIVE A NOTE OR A RECEIPT FOR THE MONEY
HE WAS AT OUR HOUSE A GOOD DEAL
I THINK WE ALL HAVE OUR PREDILECTIONS
AS A GENERAL THING THEY WERE DRESSED IN HOMESPUN JEANS BLUE OR YELLOW--HERE WERE NO OTHER VARIETIES OF IT
IT WAS FROM OBEDSTOWN EAST TENNESSEE AND WAS FOR WASHINGTON
I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO LIVE IN THE WEST
THE WRECK TOOK FIRE FROM THE DISMANTLED FURNACES
AND THEY WERE RICHER IN ANOTHER WAY ALSO
CHAPTER XVII
THEN FILLED UP THE REST OF THE HOLE WITH DIRT AND SMALL FRAGMENTS OF STONE
HE LABORED FOR THEM ALL AND WITH THEM ALL
HARRY JOINED THE COLONEL AT STONE'S LANDING AND THAT DEAD PLACE SPRANG INTO SUDDEN LIFE
ONCE AT A PICNIC BY THE LAKE AT THE RISK OF HIS OWN LIFE HE SAVED SISTER MILLIE FROM DROWNING AND WE ALL LIKED TO HAVE HIM HERE
THIS ARISTOCRACY WAS FAST AND NOT AVERSE TO OSTENTATION
SPECULATION--MY
HE COULD NOT TO BE SURE CONCEIVE HOW PHILIP COULD BE INTERESTED IN A YOUNG LADY WHO WAS STUDYING MEDICINE BUT HE HAD NO OBJECTION TO GOING FOR HE DID NOT DOUBT THAT THERE WERE OTHER GIRLS IN FALLKILL WHO WERE WORTH A WEEK'S ATTENTION
YOU VOTED FOR IT MR TROLLOP THOUGH YOU ALWAYS OPPOSED THE MEASURE UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD AN INTERVIEW ONE EVENING WITH A CERTAIN MRS MCCARTER AT HER HOUSE
IT SHALL GO FOR TAXES HE SAID AND NEVER TEMPT ME OR MINE ANY MORE HE OPENED THE WINDOW AND STOOD THERE TEARING THE TAX BILL TO BITS AND WATCHING THE BREEZE WAFT THEM AWAY TILL ALL WERE GONE
SOMETIMES HE VENTURED TO HOPE THAT HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE IN ESTIMATING THE DIRECTION WHICH THE VEIN SHOULD NATURALLY TAKE AFTER CROSSING THE VALLEY AND ENTERING THE HILL
HE HAD NOT CARRIED OFF WITH HIM ALL THE LEARNING OF THAT VENERABLE INSTITUTION BUT HE KNEW SOME THINGS THAT WERE NOT IN THE REGULAR COURSE OF STUDY
BUT HUMAN NATURE IS A QUEER THING HE ADMITS
HISTORY IS NEVER DONE WITH INQUIRING OF THESE YEARS AND SUMMONING WITNESSES ABOUT THEM AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE
HE TOOK A LIVELY INTEREST IN THE TOWN AND ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY AND MADE MANY INQUIRIES AS TO THE PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURE OF EDUCATION AND OF RELIGION AND ESPECIALLY AS TO THE CONDITION OF THE EMANCIPATED RACE
NOTHING COULD REINSTATE HIM IN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE HIS RUIN WAS IRRETRIEVABLE--HIS DISGRACE COMPLETE
I'LL FIX YOU
THERE WAS IMPORTANT EVIDENCE THAT THEY COULD NOT YET OBTAIN AND HE HOPED THE JUDGE WOULD NOT FORCE THEM TO A TRIAL UNPREPARED
GENTLEMEN WE ARE ALL HUMAN WE HAVE ALL SINNED WE ALL HAVE NEED OF MERCY
THEE WILL NO DOUBT BREAK THINGS ENOUGH WHEN THY TIME COMES CHILD
A MILLION SPENT ON THE RIVER WOULD MAKE NAPOLEON WORTH TWO MILLIONS AT LEAST I SEE NODDED THE SENATOR
IT SEEMED THAT MAJOR LACKLAND GOT SO CLOSE TRACK OF HIM THAT HE WAS ABLE TO DESCRIBE HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND LEARN HIS NAME
COULDN'T GIT SHET O THE MOST UV IT
WHAT IS IT
WHAT IS IT
AND THERE'S $100,000 OF THE MONEY GONE TO BEGIN WITH
THESE HOWEVER WERE SATISFACTORY TO MR BRAHAM
W
W
W
PERHAPS THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IN THE ENTIRE CORPS NOR WAS VERY MUCH NEEDED
HE WAS A GREAT FAVORITE HERE
WELL GOOD MORNING
YOU CAN'T NAME YOUR OWN AMANUENSIS MR TROLLOP THAT IS SAD INDEED
I JUST BEGIN TO SEE WHAT I CAN DO IN IT AND WHAT A NOBLE PROFESSION IT IS FOR A WOMAN
I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEARER HOME PHILIP WROTE A LONG LETTER FIRST OF ALL TO HIS MOTHER FULL OF LOVE AND GLOWING ANTICIPATIONS OF HIS NEW OPENING
SELLERS INSISTED IT SHOULD BE A UNIVERSITY
THEN THE ACCUSED STANDS UP AND TESTIFIES THAT HE MAY HAVE DONE IT BUT HE WAS RECEIVING AND HANDLING A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY AT THE TIME AND HE DOESN'T REMEMBER THIS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE--AT LEAST WITH SUFFICIENT DISTINCTNESS TO ENABLE HIM TO GRASP IT TANGIBLY
THE SKELETON OF A DECAYING SCAFFOLDING LINGERS ABOUT ITS SUMMIT AND TRADITION SAYS THAT THE SPIRIT OF WASHINGTON OFTEN COMES DOWN AND SITS ON THOSE RAFTERS TO ENJOY THIS TRIBUTE OF RESPECT WHICH THE NATION HAS REARED AS THE SYMBOL OF ITS UNAPPEASABLE GRATITUDE
THEN IT APPEARS THAT IF THIS TROUBLE HAD NOT OCCURRED I COULD HAVE HAD THE HAPPINESS OF MR NED THURSTON'S SERIOUS ATTENTIONS
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO THUS MEET AND MINGLE WITH YOU TO LAY ASIDE FOR A MOMENT THE HEAVY DUTIES OF AN OFFICIAL AND BURDENSOME STATION AND CONFER IN FAMILIAR CONVERSE WITH MY FRIENDS IN YOUR GREAT STATE
AND LOUISE WAS THE HAPPIEST WOMAN
HE WAS FILLED WITH DREAD WHEN HE THOUGHT OF LAURA
PERHAPS HER AGONIZED FATHER IN HIS INTERVALS OF SANITY WAS STILL SEARCHING FOR HIS LOST DAUGHTER
THE PILOT TOOK HIS GLASS AND LOOKED AT IT STEADILY FOR A MOMENT AND SAID CHIEFLY TO HIMSELF
SENATOR DILWORTHY IT IS UNDERSTOOD IS INFLEXIBLY OPPOSED TO ANY ARRANGEMENT THAT WILL NOT GIVE THE GOVERNMENT ABSOLUTE CONTROL
IF IT WAS CONFIRMED BOLTON WOULD COME RIGHT UP AGAIN
SHE COULD NOT SHUT OUT THE DREADFUL FACTS OF THE CASE BUT IT HAD BEEN ENOUGH FOR HER THAT LAURA HAD SAID IN THEIR FIRST INTERVIEW MOTHER I DID NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING SHE OBTAINED LODGINGS NEAR THE PRISON AND DEVOTED HER LIFE TO HER DAUGHTER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN REALLY HER OWN CHILD
DAY HAS GOT TO BREAK SOME TIME OR OTHER
THE CROWD RETURNED BY AND BY WITH HUNGER AND THIRST APPEASED AND AGGRAVATED THE HUNGRY AND THIRSTY HOUSE BY LOOKING CONTENTED AND COMFORTABLE
AND ONE OF THE COLONEL'S GREATEST SATISFACTIONS WAS TO GO OVER HIS ACCOUNTS AND NOTE WHAT A HANDSOME SUM THIS ACCRUING INTEREST AMOUNTED TO AND WHAT A COMFORTABLE THOUGH MODEST SUPPORT IT WOULD YIELD LAURA IN CASE REVERSES SHOULD OVERTAKE HER
HE BLUSHED EVEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT TO HIMSELF BUT TREASON WAS IN HIS MIND--HE WAS MEDITATING AT LAST THE SALE OF THE LAND
THEN THE SENATOR HAD A LONG PRIVATE CONFERENCE WITH LAURA AND UNFOLDED CERTAIN PLANS OF HIS FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY AND RELIGION AND THE POOR AND TEMPERANCE AND SHOWED HER HOW SHE COULD ASSIST HIM IN DEVELOPING THESE WORTHY AND NOBLE ENTERPRISES
IT DOES SEEM LIKE TAKING A DEAL OF UNNECESSARY PAINS FOR A BODY TO HIRE ANOTHER BODY TO CONSTRUCT A GREAT SPEECH FOR HIM AND THEN GO AND GET STILL ANOTHER BODY TO COPY IT BEFORE IT CAN BE READ IN THE HOUSE MISS HAWKINS WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SUCH TALK AS THAT WHY I AM SURE I MEAN NO HARM--NO HARM TO ANYBODY IN THE WORLD
NOW A WHITE MAN CAN CONCEIVE GREAT OPERATIONS AND CARRY THEM OUT
THE DISGRACE KILLED HIM HE WAS AN OUTCAST SIR LOATHED BY HIMSELF AND BY HIS CONSTITUENTS
THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR THE LOCATION OF SUCH A SCHOOL LIKE THE KNOBS OF EAST TENNESSEE
AND THEN HE WAS GOING TO BUILD IT OF IRON ORE
WITNESS CONFESSED THAT SHE DID NOT THINK OF IT THEN
MAYBE I'LL GET A STEAMBOAT FIRST THE SAME OLD CHAP!--ALWAYS JUST A LITTLE BIT DIVIDED ABOUT THINGS.--AND WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN YOU GET TO BE ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN IN THE WORLD CLAY I DON'T KNOW SIR
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN GLADNESS THAT FLASHED INTO HIS FACE
I OUGHT TO KILL HIM
MR BOLTON SAID HE HADN'T THE MONEY
HE WAS PLEASED AND PROUD TOO
THE DUELS BETWEEN THE ATTORNEYS AND THE WITNESSES
THE SESSION WAS DRAWING TOWARD ITS CLOSE
THE PAPERS CALLED DOWN IMPRECATIONS UPON HER HEAD
AFTER A VIGOROUS BATTLE THAT LASTED A CONSIDERABLE TIME THIS MOTION WAS CARRIED
WE MIGHT ALL HAVE BEEN HAPPY ALL THESE HEART-BREAKING YEARS IF WE HAD ACCEPTED OUR POVERTY AT FIRST AND GONE CONTENTEDLY TO WORK AND BUILT UP OUR OWN WEALTH BY OUR OWN TOIL AND SWEAT IT'S SO IT'S SO
BETWEEN US I HAVE TALKED WITH JEFF THOMPSON THE DIVISION ENGINEER
IS IT POSSIBLE THE TOWN IS SAYING ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT ME
I AM AGENT OF AN IRON MANUFACTURING COMPANY AND THEY EMPOWER ME TO OFFER YOU TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THAT LAND HAWKINS'S HEART BOUNDED WITHIN HIM
WOULD HARRY BE SUCH A FOOL AS TO BE DRAGGED INTO SOME PUBLIC SCANDAL
ALL RIGHT-SHOULDER THIS PLUNDER AND FOLLOW ME
IT WAS A TWO-STORY-AND-A-HALF BRICK AND MUCH MORE STYLISH THAN ANY OF ITS NEIGHBORS
BUT HIS EXPERIENCE WAS THAT OF ALL WHO HAD FOUGHT ON THAT FIELD BEFORE HIM
THESE CAUSES MIGHT HAVE PRODUCED INSANITY BUT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE PRODUCED IT IN THIS CASE OR THAT THE PRISONER WAS NOT AT THE TIME OF THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME IN FULL POSSESSION OF HER ORDINARY FACULTIES
SOME PEOPLE LIKE MUSTARD WITH TURNIPS BUT--NOW THERE WAS BARON PONIATOWSKI--LORD BUT THAT MAN DID KNOW HOW TO LIVE!--TRUE RUSSIAN YOU KNOW RUSSIAN TO THE BACK BONE
THE AWFUL THUNDER OF A MUD-VALVE SUDDENLY BURST FORTH DROWNING THE PRAYER AND AS SUDDENLY UNCLE DAN'L SNATCHED A CHILD UNDER EACH ARM AND SCOURED INTO THE WOODS WITH THE REST OF THE PACK AT HIS HEELS
HE BEGAN IT PURPOSING TO WIN LAURA WITHOUT BEING WON HIMSELF
CUP OF COFFEE
YES THE NATION WAS EXCITED BUT SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS CALM--WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIM AFTER THE EXPLOSION OF THE SHELL
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY'S BUSINESS THE ORDER OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES WAS FINALLY REACHED AND WHEN THE WEARY CROWDS HEARD THAT GLAD ANNOUNCEMENT ISSUE FROM THE SPEAKER'S LIPS THEY CEASED TO FRET AT THE DRAGGING DELAY AND PLUCKED UP SPIRIT
THE BRIGHT COLORS THAT HAD MADE THEM LOOK LIKE HANGING GARDENS WERE GONE WITH THE LADIES
IT WAS THIS INFLUENCE THAT GOVERNED HER CONDUCT IN THIS INTERVIEW
TAKE ME AWAY-PLEASE TAKE ME AWAY OUT OF THIS DREADFUL PLACE
TO POSSESS THE FRIENDSHIP AND THE KINDLY INTEREST OF SUCH A MAN WASHINGTON SAID IN A LETTER TO LOUISE WAS A HAPPY FORTUNE FOR A YOUNG MAN WHOSE CAREER HAD BEEN SO IMPEDED AND SO CLOUDED AS HIS
JEX AND FLUKE HAVE DESERTED THURSDAY
THE MORNING PAPERS BLAZED WITH BIG TYPE AND OVERFLOWED WITH DETAILS OF THE MURDER
DOWN BY THE STREAM WAS A DILAPIDATED BUILDING WHICH SERVED FOR A HEMP WAREHOUSE AND A SHAKY WHARF EXTENDED OUT FROM IT INTO THE WATER
WHEN THE MEN'S MINDS HAD COOLED AND SELLERS WAS GONE THEY HATED THEMSELVES FOR LETTING HIM BEGUILE THEM WITH FINE SPEECHES BUT IT WAS TOO LATE NOW--THEY AGREED TO HANG HIM ANOTHER TIME--SUCH TIME AS PROVIDENCE SHOULD APPOINT
AND YET LAURA COULD NOT BE QUITE CONTENT WITHOUT PRYING INTO TOMORROW
THERE NOW
THE TRIAL WAS PUT OFF
WHO WOULD BE ALIVE TO CARE FOR IT THEN
HE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE
NOW THEY WERE VOICES OF WARNING AND TAUNTING
I THINK THEY WERE NOW MARS CLAY YOU KNOWS BETTERN DAT
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT OF IT HE WAS PIQUED AS WELL
LAURA BEGAN TO ENCOUNTER COLD LOOKS AVERTED EYES AND PECULIAR NODS AND GESTURES WHICH PERPLEXED HER BEYOND MEASURE
SELLERS EVERY TIME
ALL WORE ONE SUSPENDER AND SOMETIMES TWO--YARN ONES KNITTED AT HOME,--SOME WORE VESTS BUT FEW WORE COATS
YOU ARE LIKE AN ICEBERG WHEN WE ARE ALONE LAURA LOOKED UP WITH WONDER IN HER GREAT EYES AND SOMETHING LIKE A BLUSH SUFFUSING HER FACE FOLLOWED BY A LOOK OF LANGOUR THAT PENETRATED HARRY'S HEART AS IF IT HAD BEEN LONGING
THEE IS VERY WELCOME PHILIP AND RUTH SHE IS VERY ILL BUT QUIETER THAN SHE HAS BEEN AND THE FEVER IS A LITTLE ABATING
BUT SAID MARGARET CONSIDER HER TOTAL INEXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD AND HER FRAIL HEALTH
I WISH WE COULD LIE DOWN AND JUST FORGET EVERYTHING AND LET IT ALL BE JUST A DREAM THAT IS DONE AND CAN'T COME BACK TO TROUBLE US ANY MORE
I AM AGAINST IT THIS IS A CRUEL DISAPPOINTMENT SAID MRS HAWKINS TO WHOM ONE GRIEF MORE OR LESS DID NOT MUCH MATTER NOW TO YOU AND WASHINGTON
IT WAS ONLY WHEN SHE WAS WITHIN THIS VAST AND GRIM ABODE OF MADNESS THAT SHE REALIZED THE HORROR OF HER SITUATION
HER DAUGHTER'S LOVE WOULD WEAN ITSELF AWAY FROM HER AND HER HEART WOULD BREAK
SENATOR DILWORTHY SAYS WE ARE BOUND TO EXTEND OUR RELIGION OVER THE ISLES OF THE SEA
I HAD AS LIEF BE DEAD AND DONE WITH IT THE COLONEL SPOKE WITH A LOW REMEMBERED VOICE THAT THRILLED THROUGH LAURA
IF SHE COULD ONLY HAVE FOUND THESE LETTERS A MONTH SOONER
NOTE
DID HE NOT BELONG TO HER BY VIRTUE OF HER OVERMASTERING PASSION
THE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH THE FASHION OF THE TOWN
MR TROLLOP--"SECOND THE MOTION THE SPEAKER--"IT IS MOVED AND CLAMOR OF VOICES
BUT PERHAPS THERE IS NO USE IN THINKING OF THAT WHY I LAID A LITTLE PLAN FOR HIS BENEFIT TWO WEEKS AGO
THE PLACE FOR A YOUNG FELLOW OF SPIRIT TO PICK UP A FORTUNE SIMPLY PICK IT UP IT'S LYING ROUND LOOSE HERE
PHILIP WAS CONSTANTLY BY HER SIDE AND SHE SEEMED TO BE CONSCIOUS OF HIS PRESENCE AND TO CLING TO HIM AS ONE BORNE AWAY BY A SWIFT STREAM CLINGS TO A STRETCHED-OUT HAND FROM THE SHORE
SHE SAW HER WAY
AND HIMSELF HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR HALF OF THE $9,640 DUE THE WORKMEN TO SAY NOTHING OF BEING IN DEBT TO THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT OF NEARLY $4,000
ALICE WAS GREATLY AMUSED WITH HARRY AND LISTENED SO SERIOUSLY TO HIS ROMANCING THAT HE EXCEEDED HIS USUAL LIMITS
DID YOU FORGET THE RAILROAD
AND HERE WE GO NOW JUST AS STRAIGHT AS A STRING FOR HALLELUJAH--IT'S A BEAUTIFUL ANGLE--HANDSOME UP GRADE ALL THE WAY--AND THEN AWAY YOU GO TO CORRUPTIONVILLE THE GAUDIEST COUNTRY FOR EARLY CARROTS AND CAULIFLOWERS THAT EVER--GOOD MISSIONARY FIELD TOO
YOU'VE TAKEN IT FOR ROCKS
AND NOW I SUPPOSE YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE TEN CENTS JERRY
SO DON'T YOU SEE
CONGRESS ENDS THE FOURTH OF MARCH
GOLD IS ONLY ONE PRODUCT
YOU MUSTN'T BE A GIRL YOU KNOW OH COLONEL I AM BECOME SO USED TO TROUBLES SO USED TO FAILURES DISAPPOINTMENTS HARD LUCK OF ALL KINDS THAT A LITTLE GOOD NEWS BREAKS ME RIGHT DOWN
LAURA SOON DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE THREE DISTINCT ARISTOCRACIES IN WASHINGTON
AND I KNOW THAT I WOULD BE A DOG NOT TO WORK FOR YOU AND THINK FOR YOU AND SCHEME FOR YOU WITH ALL MY MIGHT
GONE
IT WAS INTO SUCH A MOOD AS THIS THAT LAURA HAD DRIFTED FROM THE MUSINGS WHICH THE LETTERS OF HER LOVERS HAD CALLED UP
IN THE PURE AIR OF THE HIGHLANDS AMID THE GOLDEN GLORIES OF RIPENING SEPTEMBER RUTH RAPIDLY CAME BACK TO HEALTH
SMITH ELECTED U
THAT RASCAL SMALL HE SAID HAD SWINDLED HIM OUT OF ALL HE HAD
TIME AND TIME AGAIN GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY HAS THIS POOR SUFFERING ORPHAN FLUNG HERSELF ON HER KNEES WITH ALL HER HEART'S GRATITUDE IN HER EYES BEFORE SOME SCARRED AND CRIPPLED VETERAN BUT ALWAYS ALWAYS TO BE DISAPPOINTED ALWAYS TO BE PLUNGED INTO NEW DESPAIR--IF HIS LEGS WERE RIGHT HIS SCAR WAS WRONG IF HIS SCAR WAS RIGHT HIS LEGS WERE WRONG
BUT YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND ME NO I CONFESS I CANNOT
BUT WHAT WERE THEY COMPARED TO THE RAVISHING SMILE WITH WHICH SHE FLOODED HIS WHOLE SYSTEM
MEN WHO KNEW HER NOW JUST AS SHE WAS AND YET PLEADED AS FOR THEIR LIVES FOR THE DEAR PRIVILEGE OF CALLING THE MURDERESS WIFE
OUR TRAVELERS STOPPED IN CHICAGO LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THAT THEY COULD MAKE THEIR FORTUNES THERE IN TWO WEEK'S TIME BUT IT DID NOT SEEM WORTH WHILE
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH TO SHOW ME WHERE MY MISTAKE WAS
I COULDN'T GET ANOTHER TRUNK LIKE THAT--NOT ANOTHER LIKE IT IN AMERICA I RECKON I AM AFRAID NOT SAID WASHINGTON WITH A FAINT ATTEMPT AT A SMILE
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS AN OLD STORY AND IT NEED NOT BE DWELT ON
I MEAN TO LOOK AROUND FOR A BUILDING LOT
RUTH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE DISCONTENTED IF ALL THE WEALTH ABOUT HER HAD BEEN AS UNSUBSTANTIAL AS A DREAM
MOVE WE ADJOURN
BUT IT WAS FRUITLESS
IT WAS LATER
I WAS FAINT WITH THE HEAT
SENATOR DILWORTHY MADE ONE LITTLE EFFORT THROUGH HIS PROTEGE THE EMBRYO BANKER TO RECOVER IT BUT THERE BEING NO NOTES OF HAND OR OTHER MEMORANDA TO SUPPORT THE CLAIM IT FAILED
ONLY TEN AND HE WAS SURE OF A FORTUNE
YES EVERYBODY IS TIRED I SUPPOSE
SHE ENCOURAGED MR BUCKSTONE BY TURNS AND BY TURNS SHE HARASSED HIM
THE DELEGATES FROM THE WARD MEETINGS ORGANIZE AS A NOMINATING CONVENTION AND MAKE UP A LIST OF CANDIDATES--ONE CONVENTION OFFERING A DEMOCRATIC AND ANOTHER A REPUBLICAN LIST OF INCORRUPTIBLES
AND ALICE SAT BY THE OPEN WINDOW IN HER ROOM AT HOME LOOKING OUT UPON THE MEADOWS WHERE THE LABORERS WERE CUTTING THE SECOND CROP OF CLOVER
IF I WERE A YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN THESE TIMES PHILIP LAUGHED OUTRIGHT
HARRY LEFT IN SUCH A HURRY THAT HE HADN'T EVEN TIME TO BID MISS LAURA HAWKINS GOOD-BYE BUT HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT HARRY WOULD CONSOLE HIMSELF WITH THE NEXT PRETTY FACE HE SAW--A REMARK WHICH WAS THROWN IN FOR RUTH'S BENEFIT
IN HARRY'S-ROOM ON THE TABLE PHILIP FOUND THIS NOTE
AND IN A SHORT TIME THEIR INTIMACY WAS THE TOWN TALK
WASHINGTON WEATHER GENERALLY CANNOT BE VERY CONGENIAL TO YOU IT'S CONGENIAL SAID WASHINGTON BRIGHTENING UP WHEN IT'S NOT CONGEALED THAT'S VERY GOOD
MR SELLERS I BELIEVE BEGAN MR BRAHAM
THIS MONEY WILL NOT BE FOR ME ALONE BUT FOR ALL OF US
AND WHY DIDN'T HE KILL ME
AND THE GORGEOUS POSSIBILITIES OF THAT GREAT DOMAIN STRAIGHTWAY BEGAN TO OCCUPY HIS IMAGINATION TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE COULD SCARCELY MANAGE TO KEEP EVEN ENOUGH OF HIS ATTENTION UPON THE COLONEL'S TALK TO RETAIN THE GENERAL RUN OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING
AND I--IT'S OF NO USE--THEY SIMPLY LIE BEFORE MY FACE AND MOCK ME
BEAUTIFUL CREDIT
JUNE 18 SQUIRE HAWKINS SAT UPON THE PYRAMID OF LARGE BLOCKS CALLED THE STILE IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE CONTEMPLATING THE MORNING
THEN HE SIGHED AND SAT LONG IN MEDITATION
HE HAD HIM OUT AT GATHERINGS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE NEGRO GATHERINGS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE INDIAN GATHERINGS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE HEATHEN IN DISTANT LANDS
YOU'VE GOT TO CONCILIATE THE SOUTH CONSOLIDATE THE TWO DEBTS PAY EM OFF IN GREENBACKS AND GO AHEAD
MR WASHINGTON HAWKINS HAD A CLASS
SHE MUST TAKE INTEREST
I NEVER FIT EM SIR OH I SEE--YOU ARE PROBABLY THE AMUSEMENT COMMITTEE OF THE CITY COUNCIL
SQUIRE OLIVER MONTAGUE A LAWYER WHO HAD RETIRED FROM THE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION EXCEPT IN RARE CASES DWELT IN A SQUARE OLD FASHIONED NEW ENGLAND MANSION A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY FROM THE GREEN
HE SOUGHT THE SPOT WHERE THE COAT HAD LAIN--HE HAD TO LOOK CLOSE FOR THE LIGHT WAS WANING--THEN TO MAKE SURE HE PUT HIS HAND TO THE GROUND AND A LITTLE STREAM OF WATER SWEPT AGAINST HIS FINGERS
HE KNOWS WHAT WAR IS
WITHOUT THAT IT WOULD BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP ITS MINES BUILD ITS ROADS WORK TO ADVANTAGE AND WITHOUT GREAT WASTE ITS FRUITFUL LAND ESTABLISH MANUFACTURES OR ENTER UPON A PROSPEROUS INDUSTRIAL CAREER
HAWKINS BOUGHT OUT THE VILLAGE STORE FOR A SONG AND PROCEEDED TO REAP THE PROFITS WHICH AMOUNTED TO BUT LITTLE MORE THAN ANOTHER SONG
BUT AFTER THAT THE DOCTOR SAID IT SEEMED TO BE TOO SEVERE AND SO HE HAS FELL BACK ON HOT FOOT-BATHS AT NIGHT AND COLD SHOWERS IN THE MORNING
THE LATEST EDITIONS OF THE EVENING PAPERS HAD THE RESULT OF THE INQUEST
SO SHE WAS AT EASE UPON THOSE POINTS
PLAIN FOLKS YOU KNOW--PLAIN FOLKS
IN THE SOFT BEGINNING OF A SPRING MORNING LONG BEFORE NEW YORK HAD BREAKFASTED WHILE YET THE AIR OF EXPECTATION HUNG ABOUT THE WHARVES OF THE METROPOLIS OUR YOUNG ADVENTURERS MADE THEIR WAY TO THE JERSEY CITY RAILWAY STATION OF THE ERIE ROAD TO BEGIN THE LONG SWINGING CROOKED JOURNEY OVER WHAT A WRITER OF A FORMER DAY CALLED A CAUSEWAY OF CRACKED RAILS AND COWS TO THE WEST
I THINK IT NATURAL--PERFECTLY NATURAL IN YOU
HE WAS THE HAPPIEST MAN IN MISSOURI
AND AS THESE CHARGES WERE BACKED UP BY WHAT SEEMED TO BE GOOD AND SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THEY WERE BELIEVED WITH NATIONAL UNANIMITY
AND I CALL TO MIND NOW THAT HE ALWAYS ADMIRED THUNDER
HE DID NOT TARRY IN HAWKEYE BUT WENT ON THUS MISSING SEVERAL APPOINTMENTS WITH CREDITORS
PHILIP WAS THERE
AM I NOTHING--TO YOU AND PHILIP LOOKED A LITTLE DEFIANT AND AS IF HE HAD SAID SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BRUSH AWAY ALL THE SOPHISTRIES OF OBLIGATION ON EITHER SIDE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO LET THEM HAVE THEM MISS HAWKINS THIS SILLY BLUNDER OF MY COPYIST EVIDENTLY HAS MORE INTEREST FOR YOU THAN IT HAS FOR ME
HERE WAS THE CONTRACT MR BOLTON KNEW WHAT MATERIALS WERE WORTH AND WHAT THE LABOR WOULD COST
TELL OUR FRIENDS THE GOOD NEWS--I WANT ALL TO SHARE IT AND SHE DID TELL HER FATHER AND MOTHER BUT THEY SAID LET IT BE KEPT STILL FOR THE PRESENT
SELLERS IF YOU WOULD GO INTO POLITICS IF I HAD YOU FOR A COLLEAGUE WE SHOULD SHOW CALHOUN AND WEBSTER THAT THE BRAIN OF THE COUNTRY DIDN'T LIE EAST OF THE ALLEGANIES
AND I SUSPECT WE OWE THE VISIT NOW TO YOUR SUDDEN INTEREST IN THE FALLKILL SEMINARY PHILIP'S COLOR CAME AS IT HAD AN AWKWARD WAY OF DOING IN HIS TELL-TALE FACE BUT BEFORE HE COULD STAMMER A REPLY HARRY CAME IN WITH THAT ACCOUNTS FOR PHIL'S WISH TO BUILD A SEMINARY AT STONE'S LANDING OUR PLACE IN MISSOURI WHEN COL
AS TO THE RAILROAD PHILIP HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT IT WAS MERELY KEPT ON FOOT FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES IN WALL STREET AND HE WAS ABOUT TO QUIT IT
NOW THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE SENATE SEEMED TO BE TO SHIELD THE SENATOR AND TURN INQUIRY AWAY FROM HIM
HE HAD HIM OUT TIME AND AGAIN BEFORE SUNDAY SCHOOLS AS AN EXAMPLE FOR EMULATION
HARRY WHO THOUGHT HE WAS SHREWD AND UNDERSTOOD WASHINGTON SUGGESTED AN INTEREST
HE'S ONLY BEEN IN CONGRESS A FEW YEARS AND HE MUST BE WORTH A MILLION
THE STUDENTS LODGED AND BOARDED IN PRIVATE FAMILIES IN THE PLACE AND SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT WHILE THE SCHOOL DID A GREAT DEAL TO SUPPORT THE TOWN THE TOWN GAVE THE STUDENTS SOCIETY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF HOME LIFE
IN SPITE OF HER SELF-CONTROL
IT'S A PRIME LOT NANCY
AND THOSE WHO STOOD SO LONG WAITING FOR SUCCESS TO BRING THEM DEATH WERE USUALLY THOSE WHO HAD A JUST CLAIM
IN THE LITTLE SOCIETY OF THE PLACE THE QUAKER GIRL WAS A FAVORITE AND NO CONSIDERABLE SOCIAL GATHERING OR PLEASURE PARTY WAS THOUGHT COMPLETE WITHOUT HER
THE DREAMY LOOK WAS GONE OUT OF HER FACE ALL INDECISION HAD VANISHED
BUT YOU CAN SEE SHE IS A FASCINATING WOMAN
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT HAND-WRITING AS IF IT WAS MY OWN SIR
I HAIN'T A MITE OF DOUBT OF EVERY WORD YOU SAY
POSTEROUS!--UTTERLY PRE--BREAK A WINDOW CHILD BEFORE I SUFFOCATE NO MATTER IT'S TRUE ANYWAY
I THINK HE WILL BE TRACTABLE MAYBE
SOMETIMES SHE FOUND SHOAL WATER GOING OUT AT THE HEAD OF THOSE CHUTES OR CROSSING THE RIVER AND THEN A DECK-HAND STOOD ON THE BOW AND HOVE THE LEAD WHILE THE BOAT SLOWED DOWN AND MOVED CAUTIOUSLY
AND IF IT WAS THE HEAD THAT WAS SERVED JUST THE CANT THAT THE DILAPIDATED STRAW HAT GOT BY BEING UPLIFTED AND ROOTED UNDER WAS RETAINED UNTIL THE NEXT CALL ALTERED THE INCLINATION
I WILL WAIT ANY WHERE
THE WIVES OF SENATORS REPRESENTATIVES CABINET OFFICERS ALL SORTS OF WIVES AND SOME WHO ARE NOT WIVES USE THEIR INFLUENCE
SHE WAS WITHOUT SIN THEN AND UNACQUAINTED WITH GRIEF
HE BEGAN BY SAYING THAT HE TREMBLED AT THE RESPONSIBILITY HE HAD UNDERTAKEN
WHERE ARE THE PAPERS?--HAVE YOU GOT THE PAPERS SAFE
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULT WELL WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULT HE WOULD HAVE SHOWN YOU THE DOOR
SOMETIMES I THINK I'LL HAVE A BALLOON AND GO UP IN THE AIR
I HAVE A LETTER FROM BERIAH SELLERS--JUST CAME THIS DAY
HE THRIVED IN THE AIR OF INDEFINITE EXPECTATION
SHE HAD HOPED HE WAS DEAD
WE ALWAYS HELP CUSTOMERS ALL WE CAN
TOWARDS SPRING HE WENT TO PHILADELPHIA WITH HIS PLANS ALL MATURED FOR A NEW CAMPAIGN
I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT IT WASHINGTON WAS ABOUT SETTLING HIMSELF INTO HIS NARRATIVE STYLE WHEN MRS GEN
LAURA'S NAME OCCURRED VERY OFTEN IN THESE LETTERS AT FIRST IN CASUAL MENTION AS THE BELLE OF THE SEASON CARRYING EVERYTHING BEFORE HER WITH HER WIT AND BEAUTY AND THEN MORE SERIOUSLY AS IF HARRY DID NOT EXACTLY LIKE SO MUCH GENERAL ADMIRATION OF HER AND WAS A LITTLE NETTLED BY HER TREATMENT OF HIM
BUT PENNYBACKER YOU KNOW DON'T GO MUCH ON LAND HE STICKS TO THE LEGISLATURE AND MR BIGLER LAUGHED
BUT THEY KNEW THAT THE ROD ATTRACTED THE LIGHTNING AND SO THEY GAVE THE PLACE A WIDE BERTH IN A STORM FOR THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH MARKSMANSHIP AND DOUBTED IF THE LIGHTNING COULD HIT THAT SMALL STICK AT A DISTANCE OF A MILE AND A HALF OFTENER THAN ONCE IN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TIMES
HE HAD LONGED FOR SUCCESS PRINCIPALLY FOR RUTH'S SAKE
THE JUDGE IN HIS CHARGE REVIEWED THE TESTIMONY WITH GREAT SHOW OF IMPARTIALITY
SHE HAD LONG FELT THAT THEY WERE LIVING ON A VOLCANO THAT MIGHT GO IN TO ACTIVE OPERATION AT ANY HOUR
SHE RECALLED BRAHAM'S SPEECH SHE RECALLED THE TESTIMONY REGARDING HER LUNACY
SOMETIMES LAURA WAS EXCEEDINGLY KIND AND PETTED HIM A LITTLE AND TOOK THE TROUBLE TO EXERT HER POWERS OF PLEASING AND TO ENTANGLE HIM DEEPER AND DEEPER
BUT SHE WAS DIFFERENT AFTER THAT O YES SIR WASHINGTON HAWKINS CORROBORATED HIS MOTHER'S TESTIMONY AS TO LAURA'S CONNECTION WITH COL
REQUESTED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO TELL THE JURY ALL HE KNEW ABOUT THE KILLING HE NARRATED THE CIRCUMSTANCES SUBSTANTIALLY AS THE READER ALREADY KNOWS THEM
IT PROVED TO BE HIS NIGHTLY PRACTICE TO LET OFF THE UNEXPENDED STEAM OF HIS CONVERSATIONAL POWERS IN THE WORDS OF THIS STIRRING SONG
AND IF I HAD THAT BIT OF MANUSCRIPT I WOULD DO IT YET
NOT A MAN HAD VOTED FOR THE BILL
SELBY'S PROPOSED DEPARTURE ALARMED HER MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND SHE CALMLY DETERMINED THAT IF HE WAS DECEIVING HER THE SECOND TIME IT SHOULD BE THE LAST
OUR BILL WILL GO THROUGH IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS THEN AND WE'LL TELEGRAPH A MILLION DOLLARS TO THE JURY--TO THE LAWYERS I MEAN--AND THE VERDICT OF THE JURY WILL BE ACCIDENTAL MURDER RESULTING FROM JUSTIFIABLE INSANITY'--OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.--EVERYTHING IS DEAD SURE NOW
THESE DAY RECEPTIONS WERE ATTENDED BY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN AND THOSE INTERESTED IN THE PROBLEM MIGHT HAVE STUDIED THE COSTUMES OF THE LADIES PRESENT IN VIEW OF THIS FACT TO DISCOVER WHETHER WOMEN DRESS MORE FOR THE EYES OF WOMEN OR FOR EFFECT UPON MEN
I WILL HIRE A MAN AND PIN THIS PAGE ON HIS BREAST AND LABEL IT THE MISSING FRAGMENT OF THE HON
I RECKON HE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND DID BUT PHILIP WAS NOT LONG IN LEARNING THE TRUTH
BUT HE SERIOUSLY COUNTED THE DIMINISHING BULK OF HIS OWN HOARD WHICH WAS ALL THE MONEY HE HAD IN THE WORLD
BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT IT WAS NOW NEVER NEVER CALL A LADY'S MEMORY FICKLE AGAIN
THE NEWSPAPERS TRUSTED THE JURY WOULD HAVE THE COURAGE TO DO ITS DUTY
LONG AGO WHEN THE POSSIBILITY HAD FIRST BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE HER MIND THAT SOME DAY SHE MIGHT MOVE IN WASHINGTON SOCIETY SHE HAD RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT PRACTICED CONVERSATIONAL POWERS WOULD BE A NECESSARY WEAPON IN THAT FIELD
CAR'S FULL
SHE SMOOTHED HER HAIR REARRANGED A JEWEL HERE AND THERE AND ALL THE WHILE HER HEART SANG WITHIN HER AND HER FACE WAS RADIANT
LOUISE HAD A GOOD CRY--SEVERAL OF THEM INDEED--AND THE FAMILY CHARITABLY FOREBORE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS THAT WOULD INCREASE HER GRIEF
HE COULD HANDLE AN OAR LIKE A PROFESSIONAL AND PULL STROKE IN A WINNING RACE
HIS BROWS CONTRACTED HE PUT HIS HAND UP AND CLASPED HIS FOREHEAD AND KEPT SAYING OH IT IS TOO BAD TOO BAD TOO BAD
THE THOUGHT OF PHILIP STERLING IN LOVE IS TOO COMICAL
INDEED I WONDER HE NEVER THOUGHT OF IT HIMSELF--THERE ARE NO END OF PRECEDENTS
WHEN THERE WAS SILENCE MRS SELLERS LIFTED UPON WASHINGTON A FACE THAT BEAMED WITH A CHILDLIKE PRIDE AND SAID
HE HAD BEEN WORKING THREE SHIFTS OF MEN
WHETHER THE YOUNG BLOOD HAS YET MADE HIS WAY OUT OF BASCOM'S SWAMP WE HAVE NOT LEARNED
SHE WOULD BE BRAVE AND STRONG
IT DID NOT SEEM WISE TO HER TO PUT ONE'S ENTIRE EARTHLY TRUST IN THE TENNESSEE LAND AND NEVER THINK OF DOING ANY WORK
CONSEQUENTLY AN EXPENSIVE LOT
HE HAS SPLENDID IDEAS AND HE'LL DIVIDE HIS CHANCES WITH HIS FRIENDS WITH A FREE HAND THE GOOD GENEROUS SOUL BUT SOMETHING DOES SEEM TO ALWAYS INTERFERE AND SPOIL EVERYTHING
HE OVERHEARD PEOPLE SAY HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY BRIGHT--THEY WERE CHIEFLY MAMMAS AND MARRIAGEABLE YOUNG LADIES
AND THEN ASHAMED OF HIMSELF HE HALTED IN THE DEEP DARKNESS AND SHOUTED BUT RATHER FEEBLY HEAH I IS LORD HEAH I IS THERE WAS A MOMENT OF THROBBING SUSPENSE AND THEN TO THE SURPRISE AND THE COMFORT OF THE PARTY IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE AUGUST PRESENCE HAD GONE BY FOR ITS DREADFUL NOISES WERE RECEDING
WHEN HOWEVER THEY REACHED STONE'S LANDING THE SENATOR LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND INQUIRED IS THIS NAPOLEON THIS IS THE NUCLEUS THE NUCLEUS SAID THE COLONEL UNROLLING HIS MAP
ARRIVED THERE HE PERCEIVED BY THE NEWSPAPERS THAT THE TRIAL WAS NEAR ITS CLOSE
I PURPOSE MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOR TO SHOW THE CAUSE AND THE ORIGIN OF AN ABERRATION OF MIND TO FOLLOW IT UP WITH OTHER LIKE EVIDENCE CONNECTING IT WITH THE VERY MOMENT OF THE HOMICIDE SHOWING A CONDITION OF THE INTELLECT OF THE PRISONER THAT PRECLUDES RESPONSIBILITY THE STATE MUST INSIST UPON ITS OBJECTIONS SAID THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
THE HOST AND HOSTESS STOOD JUST WITHIN THE DOOR OF ENTRANCE
THERE WAS NO GREEN SPOT REMAINING ANYWHERE IN MEMORY OF A HOPE THAT HAD FOUND ITS FRUITION
DURING THE MORNING LAURA DROVE DOWN TO MRS SCHOONMAKER'S TO PAY A FRIENDLY CALL
WASHINGTON SEEMED TO HER ONLY TO DREAM OF IT AND TO BE WILLING TO WAIT FOR ITS RICHES TO FALL UPON HIM IN A GOLDEN SHOWER
HE GRACED THE SEWING CIRCLES OF THE LADIES WITH HIS PRESENCE AND EVEN TOOK A NEEDLE NOW AND THEN AND MADE A STITCH OR TWO UPON A CALICO SHIRT FOR SOME POOR BIBLELESS PAGAN OF THE SOUTH SEAS AND THIS ACT ENCHANTED THE LADIES WHO REGARDED THE GARMENTS THUS HONORED AS IN A MANNER SANCTIFIED
DOUBTLESS THESE PLACES ARE LOW
OLD MAN BOLTON'S BEHIND HIM
LET ME KNOW MR BRIERLY WHEN YOU ARE READY TO LOCATE
THIS IS ALL GENTLEMEN
OUT FROM THIS TUGGING LAUGHING CHATTERING DISGUISE OF LEGS AND ARMS AND LITTLE FACES THE COLONEL'S VOICE WORKED ITS WAY AND HIS TIRELESS TONGUE RAN BLITHELY ON WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
IT WAS ALWAYS A TIME OF CONFIDENCES
HE WAS A KINDLY SORT OF MAN AND SEEMED VERY MUCH INTERESTED
BUT I HAVE ONE PRINCIPLE IN MY PUBLIC LIFE WHICH I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND
WHAT A STONE-BLIND IDIOT I HAVE BEEN WELL TAKE IT ALL AROUND I SUPPOSE YOU HAD A PLEASANT TIME IN WASHINGTON SAID THE PRESIDENT GATHERING UP THE LETTERS
I MUST SEND THE PRESIDENT SOME FROM MY CELLAR
LAURA WENT DOWN STAIRS KNOCKED AT/THE STUDY DOOR AND ENTERED SCARCELY WAITING FOR THE RESPONSE
WE SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN MR STERLING SHE SAID AS SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND WITH JUST A SHADE OF SADNESS IN HER HANDSOME EYES
IN THE PRINCIPAL STREET OF THE CITY IT HAD RECEIVED MORE ATTENTION
THE VOYAGE WAS DELIGHTFUL AND WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO BECOME MONOTONOUS
HE DECEIVED HER WITH A MOCK MARRIAGE
HE WOULD MAKE HIS MARK IN LITERATURE
IF YOU FIND SHE WAS NOT IN HER RIGHT MIND THAT SHE WAS THE VICTIM OF INSANITY HEREDITARY OR MOMENTARY AS IT HAS BEEN EXPLAINED YOUR VERDICT WILL TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT
WHAT OF IT
THE SPEAKER'S GAVEL CAME TO THE RESCUE AND HIS CLEAR VOICE FOLLOWED
SHE MIGHT NOT LIKE IT I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SHOULD BRING ALICE UP ON EVERY OCCASION
TALK ABOUT BASING THE CURRENCY ON GOLD
WHEN YOU FINISHED YOUR BREAKFAST AT TEN O'CLOCK AND WENT OUT THE SUNSHINE WAS BRILLIANT THE WEATHER BALMY AND DELICIOUS AND THE MUD AND SLUSH DEEP AND ALL-PERVADING
MY GOD I AM HUMBLED MY PRIDE IS ALL GONE MY STUBBORN HEART REPENTS--HAVE PITY WHEN THE SPRING MORNING DAWNED THE FORM STILL SAT THERE THE ELBOWS RESTING UPON THE TABLE AND THE FACE UPON THE HANDS
AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVEN'T A CENT IN THE WORLD AND WE'VE SENT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A-BEGGING NANCY YOU FRIGHTEN ME
OH NOT AT ALL NOT AT ALL MY CHILD
GENTLEMEN HAVE YOU AGREED UPON YOUR VERDICT FOREMAN
PHILIP LEARNED THAT HARRY AND LAURA HAD BOTH BEEN TAKEN TO THE CITY PRISON AND HE WENT THERE
SHE HAD READ OF SUCH MEN BUT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE ONE SO HIGH-BRED SO NOBLE IN SENTIMENT SO ENTERTAINING IN CONVERSATION SO ENGAGING IN MANNER
MOTHER I THINK I WOULDN'T SAY ALWAYS TO ANY ONE UNTIL I HAVE A PROFESSION AND AM AS INDEPENDENT AS HE IS
DILWORTBY WILL BE ELECTED TO-DAY AND BY DAY AFTER TO-MORROW NIGHT HE WILL BE IN NEW YORK READY TO PUT IN HIS SHOVEL--AND YOU HAVEN'T LIVED IN WASHINGTON ALL THIS TIME NOT TO KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WALK RIGHT BY A SENATOR WHOSE TERM IS UP WITHOUT HARDLY SEEING HIM WILL BE DOWN AT THE DEEPO TO SAY WELCOME BACK AND GOD BLESS YOU
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS A LITTLE SPRAY OF BOX
NOW WHAT WOULD YOU CALL STEALING WHY TAKING PROPERTY IS STEALING PROPERTY
A BENCH STOOD NEAR THE DOOR WITH A TIN WASH BASIN ON IT AND A PAIL OF WATER AND A GOURD
BUT SLOWLY THE CONFUSION IN HIS MIND TOOK FORM AND HE REMEMBERED HIS GREAT LOSS
PRESENTLY THE PILOT SAID
FINALLY BOTH SPOKE AT ONCE
THERE'S BETTER GAME
SHE EXPECTED VISITS FROM HER NEW FRIENDS SHE WOULD HAVE COMPANY THE NEW BOOKS AND THE PERIODICALS ABOUT WHICH ALL THE WORLD WAS TALKING AND IN SHORT SHE WOULD HAVE LIFE
THEY WERE NOISELESSLY BUSY AND THEY TALKED IN WHISPERS WHEN THEY SPOKE
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE CAN BE ANY GOOD SOUND HELP FOR HIM IN SUCH A CLIMATE AS THIS
I BELIEVE THAT YOU AND I TOGETHER COULD RUN THIS GOVERNMENT BEAUTIFULLY UNCLE THE SENATOR BEAMED AGAIN
HE WISHED PHILIP WAS IN WASHINGTON
NOBODY COULD GET ANYTHING DEFINITE FROM LAURA ABOUT THESE MATTERS AND SO GOSSIP HAD TO FEED ITSELF CHIEFLY UPON GUESSES
HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO HURRY TO THE STATES AND SAVE HIS SISTER IF POSSIBLE FOR HE LOVED HER WITH A DEEP AND ABIDING AFFECTION
I WISH THEY WOULD START SOMETHING FRESH
THERE WAS NOTHING SIGNIFICANT IN THE FACT THAT LOUISE DREAMY AND DISTRAUGHT STOOD AT HER BEDROOM BUREAU THAT NIGHT SCRIBBLING WASHINGTON HERE AND THERE OVER A SHEET OF PAPER
THE GOSSIPS WERE SOON AT WORK
THE NEXT MORNING THE HOOVERVILLE PATRIOT AND CLARION HAD THIS ITEM SLIGHTUALLY OVERBOARD
BUT IT WAS JUST A PLAIN ROOMY HOUSE CAPABLE OF EXTENDING TO MANY GUESTS AN UNPRETENDING HOSPITALITY
I FROM THE ORIENT TO THE DROOPING WEST MAKING THE WIND MY POST-HORSE STILL UNFOLD THE ACTS COMMENCED ON THIS BALL OF EARTH
YOU SEE IT'S BOOMING RIGHT ALONG IN OUR DIRECTION--FOLLOWS THE GULF STREAM YOU KNOW JUST AS ALL THOSE EPIDEMICS DO AND WITHIN THREE MONTHS IT WILL BE JUST WALTZING THROUGH THIS LAND LIKE A WHIRLWIND
IT BLOCKS UP MY ROAD COMPLETELY
IT IS THIS
HER MOTHER WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS CHANGE IN HER WITH THE IMPROVEMENT IN HER HEALTH AND THE INTEREST SHE EXHIBITED IN HOME AFFAIRS
SHOOK HANDS ALL AROUND AND RESUMED HIS SOLITARY COMMUNINGS
A PROCESSION OF DISTURBING THOUGHTS BEGAN TO TROOP THROUGH HER MIND
BUT WHAT TOLD STILL MORE UPON THEM WAS THE UNDENIABLE FACT THAT THE PROMISE OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS DIMINISHED EVERY DAY NOW
HE WASN'T OUR UNCLE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS TO US--SOME KIN OR ANOTHER I RECKON--FATHER'S SEEN HIM A THOUSAND TIMES--HAIN'T YOU FATHER
RAILROAD GOES ALL OVER IT AND ALL THROUGH IT--WADES RIGHT ALONG ON STILTS
HE TRIED TO BELIEVE IN THE HEALTHFULNESS OF THE INVENTION AND SUCCEEDED TOLERABLY WELL
LAURA HAD HER OWN REASONS FOR WISHING TO KNOW THE SENATOR AND THE SENATOR WAS NOT A MAN WHO COULD BE CALLED INDIFFERENT TO CHARMS SUCH AS HERS
AND HE REJOICED THAT SHE HAD IN SUCH MATTERS WHAT HE CALLED THE AIRY GRACE OF SANITY
WASHINGTON SUGGESTED THAT SHE GET SOME OLD FRIEND OF THE FAMILY TO COME WITH HER AND SAID THE SENATOR WOULD DEADHEAD HIM HOME AGAIN AS SOON AS HE HAD GROWN TIRED OF THE SIGHTS OF THE CAPITAL
PERHAPS MISS HAWKINS CAN YES I CAN
WHALE IT AT HER POW-WOW-CHOW
LOOKING FOR AN OPENING YES LOOKING AROUND REPLIED HARRY
WHY NOT LET RUTH TRY THE STUDY FOR A TIME SUGGESTED ELI
THERE IS NO SUCH LAW OR CUSTOM AS THAT TO WHICH HIS HONOR IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE REFERRED
NOR WAS THIS ALTOGETHER UNSATISFACTORY TO PHILIP
SHE WAS SO UNCONSTRAINED AND SINCERELY CORDIAL THAT IT MADE THAT HERO OF THE WEST FEEL SOMEHOW YOUNG AND VERY ILL AT EASE
I NO MORE LOOK FOR DUPLICITY AND DECEPTION IN ANOTHER MAN THAN I WOULD LOOK FOR IT IN MYSELF
IT'S ALL A WHIRL
PHILIP LOOKED RATHER DUBIOUS AT THIS SENTENCE AND WISHED THAT HE HAD WRITTEN NOTHING ABOUT INDIANS
HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE UP THE RIVER
BLESS HER
HE HARDLY FANCIED IT AT FIRST BUT HE FELL IN LOVE WITH IT AFTER A BIT
WAS SHE THINKING ABOUT PHILIP AS SHE GAZED ACROSS THE FRESH LAWN OVER THE TREE TOPS TO THE CHELTON HILLS OR OF THAT WORLD WHICH HIS ENTRANCE INTO HER TRADITION-BOUND LIFE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MEANS OF OPENING TO HER
WAS IT NOT WONDERFUL THAT FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OVER A GENERATION THE CHOICEST PORTION OF THEM HAD REMAINED IN ONE FAMILY UNTOUCHED AS IF SEPARATED FOR SOME GREAT USE
BUT OF COURSE FAMILIARITY WITH THESE THINGS SOON TOOK AWAY THEIR TERRORS AND THEN THE VOYAGE AT ONCE BECAME A GLORIOUS ADVENTURE A ROYAL PROGRESS THROUGH THE VERY HEART AND HOME OF ROMANCE A REALIZATION OF THEIR ROSIEST WONDER-DREAMS
AND REALLY IT PROMISED VERY WELL
HOW'S YOUR STEAM NOW HARRY HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-TWO SIR BREAK UP THE CASKS OF BACON IN THE FORRARD HOLD
AND YET IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT PHILIP DID NOT CONVEY THE IMPRESSION TO THE WORLD OF A VERY SERIOUS YOUNG MAN OR OF A MAN WHO MIGHT NOT RATHER EASILY FALL INTO TEMPTATION
TELL ME--IS ANYTHING THE MATTER THE BOY SIGNIFIED WITH A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE GESTURE THAT THE TROUBLE WAS IN THE HOUSE AND MADE ROOM FOR HAWKINS TO PASS
WHY COULDN'T THESE THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN FATHER'S DAY
A REAL SOUTHERNER
AT THIS MOMENT AND WHILE PHILIP WAS TRYING TO FRAME A QUESTION THAT HE FOUND IT EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO PUT INTO WORDS THE DOOR OPENED QUIETLY AND RUTH ENTERED
WITHIN FIFTEEN MINUTES HIS TONGUE HAD DONE ITS WORK AND THEY WERE ALL RICH MEN.--HE GAVE EVERY ONE OF THEM A LOT IN THE SUBURBS OF THE CITY OF STONE'S LANDING WITHIN A MILE AND A HALF OF THE FUTURE POST OFFICE AND RAILWAY STATION AND THEY PROMISED TO RESUME WORK AS SOON AS HARRY GOT EAST AND STARTED THE MONEY ALONG
FOR HER PRESENCE AT DINNER HE WOULD ENDURE THE LONG BORE OF THE SENATOR'S TALK AFTERWARDS WHILE LAURA WAS OFF AT SOME ASSEMBLY OR EXCUSED HERSELF ON THE PLEA OF FATIGUE
SATURDAY NIGHT CAME BUT THE MEN WERE OBLIGED TO WAIT BECAUSE THE APPROPRIATION HAD NOT COME
THE GREAT PUBLIC IS SENTIMENTAL
HE WAS NEVER MOODY FOR ONE THING BUT LENT HIMSELF WITH ALACRITY TO WHATEVER HER FANCY WAS
A WAR WOULD GIVE SUCH A FELLOW A CAREER AND VERY LIKELY FAME
COULD LAURA HAVE RUN AWAY WITH HIM
IT WAS EXCITING WORK FOR ALL CONCERNED IN IT
IT SEEMED INEXPLICABLE FOR INSTANCE THAT HIS LIFE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THROWN SO MUCH WITH HIS COLLEGE ACQUAINTANCE HENRY BRIERLY
NATURE MUST NEEDS BE LAVISH WITH THE MOTHER AND CREATOR OF MEN AND CENTRE IN HER ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF LIFE
BUT IF IT WERE IT WOULD STILL BE THE FAULT OF THE MINORITY FOR THE MAJORITY DON'T INSTITUTE THESE PROCEEDINGS
POOR CRAWLING THING LET HIM GO
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT CURSED SELBY
I'M TO HAVE THE SUB-CONTRACT FOR THE FIRST FIFTY MILES AND YOU CAN BET IT'S A SOFT THING I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU DO PHILIP CONTINUED LARRY IN A BURST OF GENEROSITY IF I DON'T GET YOU INTO MY CONTRACT YOU'LL BE WITH THE ENGINEERS AND YOU JEST STICK A STAKE AT THE FIRST GROUND MARKED FOR A DEPOT BUY THE LAND OF THE FARMER BEFORE HE KNOWS WHERE THE DEPOT WILL BE AND WE'LL TURN A HUNDRED OR SO ON THAT
INDEED IT WAS NO SECRET IN WASHINGTON THAT A TWO-THIRDS VOTE IN THE SENATE WAS READY AND WAITING TO BE CAST FOR THE UNIVERSITY BILL AS SOON AS IT SHOULD COME BEFORE THAT BODY
JEFF THOMPSON CAN OUT-ENGINEER ANY CIVIL ENGINEER THAT EVER SIGHTED THROUGH AN ANEROID OR A THEODOLITE OR WHATEVER THEY CALL IT--HE CALLS IT SOMETIMES ONE AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER JUST WHICHEVER LEVELS OFF HIS SENTENCE NEATEST I RECKON
PHILIP MARCHED UP TO HIM AND BURST OUT WITH YOU ARE A BRUTE AN INFERNAL BRUTE TO TREAT A WOMAN THAT WAY PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A FUSS ABOUT IT SNEERED THE CONDUCTOR
EIGHT YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE DEATH OF MR HAWKINS
A GREAT WEIGHT WAS TAKEN OFF AND THE SPIRITS OF THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD ROSE MAGICALLY
HAD HE NOT CONFESSED IT HIMSELF
CHAPTER XXIX
THE TRIAL'S POSTPONED TILL FEBRUARY AND WE'LL SAVE THE CHILD YET
HE'S NEVER DOWN-HEARTED--NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE IN HIS LIFE--DIDN'T KNOW IT IF HE HAD
YOU HAVE RUINED MY LIFE SHE SAID
THEN I SHOULD NOT HAVE HATED YOU LAURA SAID THE COLONEL NERVING HIMSELF BUT STILL PALE AND SPEAKING APPEALINGLY DON'T SAY THAT
NOW IS IT YOU SURE ENOUGH--TURN AROUND
THE BEWILDERED STRICKEN CHILD--WHO CAN SAY WHAT CHANGES THE FEARFUL EVENT WROUGHT IN HER TENDER BRAIN--CLINGS TO THE FIRST PERSON WHO SHOWS HER SYMPATHY
IT IS A WIDE STRETCH OF CHEAP LITTLE BRICK HOUSES WITH HERE AND THERE A NOBLE ARCHITECTURAL PILE LIFTING ITSELF OUT OF THE MIDST--GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS THESE
SELLERS WAS RELATED TO THE HAWKINS FAMILY
AND EVEN BETTER FOR HE COULD NOT LIVE AS WELL EVEN AT THE CITY HOTEL AS HE WOULD THERE AND YET THE HOTEL CHARGED FIFTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH WHERE A MAN HAD A GOOD ROOM
AND CAN YOU EAT ANY THING NO I AM NOT HUNGRY
I AM CHECKMATED
AH JUST SO
LAURA RECOGNIZED THAT FACT NO DOUBT
THEN BOTH CAME FORWARD AND THE PROPRIETOR SAID
THE PRESIDING OFFICER WAS NODDING
I'VE BEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN
PENNYBACKER SAYS IT'S FULL OF COAL HE'S NO DOUBT OF IT AND A RAILROAD TO STRIKE THE ERIE WOULD MAKE IT A FORTUNE SUPPOSE YOU TAKE THE LAND AND WORK THE THING UP MR BIGLER
WHY THE PEOPLE GAVE HIM A TOWERING ILLUSTRIOUS POSITION A GRAND IMPOSING POSITION
IF HE DESERVED PUNISHMENT WHAT MORE WOULD YOU HAVE
OR DRAWING FOR MISS ALICE AN AMUSING PICTURE OF THE SOCIAL CONTRASTS OF NEW ENGLAND AND THE BORDER WHERE HE HAD BEEN
TELL HIM TO SIGHT FOR STONE'S
A PERSON SEEING ME AT HOME MIGHT THINK I PAID NO ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS IN THE HOUSE JUST LET THINGS FLOW IN AND OUT
I SHALL COME OUT WINNER ALL IN GOOD TIME
HE WAS THE INVENTOR OF NO ONE KNEW HOW MANY USELESS CONTRIVANCES WHICH WERE NOT WORTH PATENTING AND HIS YEARS HAD BEEN PASSED IN DREAMING AND PLANNING TO NO PURPOSE
THIS WAS MORE CRUEL THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR SHE HAD A DIM NOTION OF WHAT IT WOULD BE TO LEAVE LAURA TO HERSELF
NOT FINDING ANYTHING THERE HE LOOKED UP WITH A SERIOUS AND ANNOYED AIR ANXIOUSLY SLAPPED HIS RIGHT PANTALOON'S POCKET AND THEN HIS LEFT AND EXCLAIMED BY GEORGE THAT'S ANNOYING
IT WAS ALL ON THE TABLE
THEN HE PUT OUT HIS SMALL HAND AND SMOOTHED THE HAIR AND STROKED THE DEAD FACE LOVINGLY
HEAVENS AND EARTH BUT THAT BRAHAM'S A WONDERFUL MAN--A WONDERFUL MAN SIR
MAMMON
AND THERE FOR AN HOUR THEY WORKED AT THEIR SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITHOUT SPEAKING BUT NOT WITHOUT AN AWE OF THE PRESENCE THERE THE NEW ONE AND NOT WITHOUT AN AWFUL SENSE OF LIFE ITSELF AS THEY HEARD THE PULSATIONS OF THE MUSIC AND THE LIGHT LAUGHTER FROM THE DANCING-HALL
WHY WHAT IS THE REPUBLIC OF AMERICA FOR AN EYE-WATER COUNTRY
THEY LOOK LARGE OF COURSE--THEY LOOK LARGE TO A NOVICE BUT TO A MAN WHO HAS BEEN ALL HIS LIFE ACCUSTOMED TO LARGE OPERATIONS--SHAW
THE YOUNG STOCK COST BUT A TRIFLE THE REARING BUT ANOTHER TRIFLE AND SO HAWKINS WAS EASILY PERSUADED TO EMBARK HIS SLENDER MEANS IN THE ENTERPRISE AND TURN OVER THE KEEP AND CARE OF THE ANIMALS TO SELLERS AND UNCLE DAN'L
I OUGHT TO HAVE SENT A MESSENGER ON HORSEBACK HALF AN HOUR AGO HE ADDED TO PHILIP SHE WILL BE TRANSPORTED WITH OUR VICTORY
I HAVE OFTEN WISHED YOU WOULD COME AND TELL ME MORE ABOUT CAIRO AND THE PYRAMIDS AS YOU ONCE PROMISED ME YOU WOULD WHY DO YOU REMEMBER THAT YET MISS HAWKINS
THE CAPTAIN PUT DOWN THE GLASS
HE TOOK THE TICKET
HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO SHOUT DONE
HE BEGGED FOR IT
IT IS LIKE THE PEACE OF GOD SAID THE SENATOR DEVOUTLY
NOW IT MIGHT OCCUR TO THE READER THAT PERHAPS LAURA HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT RUDELY SUGGESTIVE IN HER REMARKS TO MRS OREILLE WHEN THE SUBJECT OF CORALS WAS UNDER DISCUSSION BUT IT DID NOT OCCUR TO LAURA HERSELF
COLONEL
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D PROSPECT A BIT WELL IT WAS TOLERABLE THICK AND LOOKED AS IF IT MIGHT BE THE VEIN--LOOKED AS IF IT OUGHT TO BE THE VEIN
JUDGE O'SHAUNNESSY NEVER HAD A LUCRATIVE PRACTICE NOR A LARGE SALARY BUT HE HAD PRUDENTLY LAID AWAY MONEY--BELIEVING THAT A DEPENDANT JUDGE CAN NEVER BE IMPARTIAL--AND HE HAD LANDS AND HOUSES TO THE VALUE OF THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
WELL AT LAST WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED
AND IF ANY THING HAPPENS--MINES EXPLODE SOMETIMES--THEE CAN SEND FOR ME
IT WAS REGARDED AS A SURE EVIDENCE OF HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND IT WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO OBTAIN HELP THAN IF HE HAD INSTEAD OF RETRENCHING LAUNCHED INTO SOME NEW SPECULATION
I'VE GOT ENOUGH BUT HE HADN'T
ARE YOU AN IDIOT FRESH BAKED
GENTLEMEN DO YOU WONDER IF THIS WOMAN THUS PURSUED LOST HER REASON WAS BESIDE HERSELF WITH FEAR AND THAT HER WRONGS PREYED UPON HER MIND UNTIL SHE WAS NO LONGER RESPONSIBLE FOR HER ACTS
I'VE TOLD BOUTWELL SO
WHY THE ASIATIC PLAGUE THAT NEARLY DEPOPULATED LONDON A COUPLE OF CENTURIES AGO BUT HOW DOES THAT CONCERN US
I KNOW IT SI
NO I SAY I KNOW YOU MR TROLLOP
AND THE LECTURES AND THE DISSECTING ROOMS HAS THEE THOUGHT OF THE DISSECTING ROOMS MOTHER SAID RUTH CALMLY I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER
I WAS AFRAID OF IT--WAS AFRAID OF IT
THIS WAS SENATOR BALAAM'S PAPER--OR RATHER BROTHER BALAAM AS HE WAS POPULARLY CALLED FOR HE HAD BEEN A CLERGYMAN IN HIS DAY
NOT A DAY THAT I DON'T PUT ASIDE AN OPPORTUNITY
HAVEN'T YOU PAID THE MEN PAID THEM
SOME YAWNED AND STRETCHED
LORD I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU
SHE HAD ALSO RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT SINCE HER DEALINGS THERE MUST BE MAINLY WITH MEN AND MEN WHOM SHE SUPPOSED TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY CULTIVATED AND ABLE SHE WOULD NEED HEAVIER SHOT IN HER MAGAZINE THAN MERE BRILLIANT SOCIETY NOTHINGS
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT TRUNK IS WORTH IS IT IN GOOD REPAIR PERFECT
BUT HE WAS EVIDENTLY UNEASY AND AT LENGTH WROTE IN SUCH MISERABLE SPIRITS THAT PHILIP ASKED HIM SQUARELY WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
THE MONTAGUES IT IS PERHAPS WELL TO SAY HAD INTENDED TO COME OVER IN THE MAYFLOWER BUT WERE DETAINED AT DELFT HAVEN BY THE ILLNESS OF A CHILD
HE HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR SERIOUS CONVERSATION WITH HER
NOW SHE'S SWEETENING OLD BROTHER BALAAM
AFTER SOME MONTHS HE BRUTALLY ABANDONED HER AND SPURNED HER AS IF SHE WERE A CONTEMPTIBLE THING
LAURA DID NOT CARE WHAT THEY WERE DEVOTED TO IT WAS SAID A WORLD OF VERY DIFFERENT GOSSIP TO THE CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING BUT THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER HEIRS AND THEY WOULD BE GUIDED ENTIRELY BY THE SENATOR'S WISHES
I AM GLAD TO SEE MY DEAR SIR SAID THE SENATOR THAT YOU GIVE THEM THE DOCTRINES
A HUNDRED THOUSAND
THE AUTHORS
BE VERY VERY CAREFUL MY DEAR
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS
2 WAS THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE MIDDLE GROUND--OF WHICH MORE ANON
SELLERS SAID NO HIS DUTY WAS AT HOME
IF I COULD ONLY DIE SHE SAID
DO NOT DISTURB ME
THE SENTENCE WAS NEVER FINISHED
THE OTHER FOURTEEN HOUSES WERE SCATTERED ABOUT AMONG THE TALL PINE TREES AND AMONG THE CORN-FIELDS IN SUCH A WAY THAT A MAN MIGHT STAND IN THE MIDST OF THE CITY AND NOT KNOW BUT THAT HE WAS IN THE COUNTRY IF HE ONLY DEPENDED ON HIS EYES FOR INFORMATION
I SUPPOSE IF THE PEOPLE WANTED DECENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THEY WOULD ELECT THEM
OPPONENTS MIGHT DESERT THEN ONE BY ONE AND WEAKEN THEIR PARTY FOR THEY HAD NO PERSONAL STAKE IN THE BILL
AND THEN THE BUGLE TOOTED GAILY AGAIN AND AGAIN THE VEHICLE WENT TEARING BY THE HORSES
IF THEY WERE ORPHANS WOULD THEY LIKE TO BE BROUGHT UP IN A GRECIAN TEMPLE
NOTHING IS LOST OF THE SHARP WRANGLE OF THE COUNSEL ON POINTS OF LAW THE MEASURED DECISION'S OF THE BENCH
THEY MEANT NO HARM THEY ONLY WANTED TO KNOW
TWO MILLIONS
BUT OFTEN WHEN PHILIP OPENED HIS EYES IN THOSE FIRST DAYS OF SUFFERING AND FOUND HER STANDING BY HIS BEDSIDE HE SAW A LOOK OF TENDERNESS IN HER ANXIOUS FACE THAT QUICKENED HIS ALREADY FEVERISH PULSE A LOOK THAT REMAINED IN HIS HEART LONG AFTER HE CLOSED HIS EYES
ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE SEVERAL CHEWERS EXPRESSED A CHARGE OF TOBACCO JUICE AND DELIVERED IT AT THE DECEASED WITH STEADY AIM AND FAULTLESS ACCURACY
HE HAS OFTEN WANTED ME TO COME EVER SINCE HE MOVED TO HAWKEYE I'M AFRAID HE CAN'T WELL COME FOR YOU WASHINGTON
IT IS BUT A LITTLE SUM COMPARED TO WHAT WE COULD GET BY WAITING BUT I DO SO LONG TO SEE THE DAY WHEN I CAN CALL YOU MY OWN THAT I HAVE SAID TO MYSELF BETTER TAKE THIS AND ENJOY LIFE IN A HUMBLE WAY THAN WEAR OUT OUR BEST DAYS IN THIS MISERABLE SEPARATION
AT THE END THE JUDGE DECIDED TO ADMIT THE TESTIMONY AS THE JUDGE USUALLY DOES IN SUCH CASES AFTER A SUFFICIENT WASTE OF TIME IN WHAT ARE CALLED ARGUMENTS
YOU SEE WHAT IT IS AS FAR AS I'VE GOT AND IF I HAD ENOUGH BOTTLES AND SOAP AND BOOT-JACKS AND SUCH THINGS TO CARRY IT ALONG TO WHERE IT JOINS ONTO THE UNION PACIFIC FOURTEEN HUNDRED MILES FROM HERE I SHOULD EXHIBIT TO YOU IN THAT LITTLE INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT A SPECTACLE OF INCONCEIVABLE SUBLIMITY
IF FRANCOIS DON'T GET BETTER SOON WE'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR SOME OTHER PLACE OR ELSE EUROPE
HE WAS VERY WEAK
AND THUS HE SAW IT TRAVEL THE ROUND OF THE GENTLEMEN AND OVERFLOW REARWARD AMONG THE LADIES
LAURA WAS ALONE CALM AND SELF-CONTAINED THOUGH SHE WAS NOT UNMOVED BY THE SIGHT OF THE GRIEF OF HER FRIENDS
MERE POCKET MONEY
TO VISIT SUCH A FAMILY WAS TO FIND ONE'S SELF CONFRONTED BY A CONGRESS MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE IMPERIAL MYTHS AND THE MAJESTIC DEAD OF ALL THE AGES
HE IS NOT SUCH A BAD FELLOW
THAT PUTS A DIFFERENT ASPECT UPON THE MATTER
FOLKS ALL WELL I SUPPOSE
CHAPTER XXI
HE WOULD SUE IT
A LOT APIECE IN THE SUBURBS OF THE LANDING OUGHT TO DO A CONGRESSMAN BUT I RECKON YOU'LL HAVE TO MORTGAGE A PART OF THE CITY ITSELF TO THE BROKERS HARRY DID NOT FIND THAT EAGERNESS TO LEND MONEY ON STONE'S LANDING IN WALL STREET WHICH COL
LAURA SAID THAT VERY LIKELY IT WAS ONLY HER NERVOUSNESS
THE CROWD OF SPECTATORS WHO HAD WATCHED THE TRIAL WERE MOVED WITH THE MOST PROFOUND SYMPATHY FOR LAURA
LOOK IN WHEN YOU ARE PASSING
SELLERS SAID HE DIDN'T CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THE GRADES IF THE ROAD COULD ONLY BE MADE TO REACH THE ELEVATORS ON THE RIVER
IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE HOWEVER WHETHER HARRY WAS IN HIS ROOM IN A HOTEL OR IN A TENT PHILIP SOON FOUND HE WAS JUST THE SAME
SIT DOWN SIT DOWN BUT THE MASS WAS TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR
I WANTED TO TALK WITH THEE A LITTLE ABOUT THY PLANS MOTHER
BUT TOMORRER'LL DO I SPECT THE SPEAKER BUNCHED HIS THICK LIPS TOGETHER LIKE THE STEM-END OF A TOMATO AND SHOT A BUMBLE-BEE DEAD THAT HAD LIT ON A WEED SEVEN FEET AWAY
BUT NOW I SHOWED YOU THESE THINGS IN CONFIDENCE YOU UNDERSTAND
I NEVER CARED ANYTHING FOR HIM ANYWAY AND THEN WITH SMALL CONSISTENCY SHE CRIED A LITTLE AND PATTED HER FOOT MORE INDIGNANTLY THAN EVER
CLAY WAS AWAY ON A LONG ABSENCE IN SOME OF THE EASTWARD ISLANDS WHEN LAURA'S TROUBLES BEGAN TRYING AND ALMOST IN VAIN TO ARRANGE CERTAIN INTERESTS WHICH HAD BECOME DISORDERED THROUGH A DISHONEST AGENT AND CONSEQUENTLY HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE MURDER TILL HE RETURNED AND READ HIS LETTERS AND PAPERS
SHE EXCITED HIS HOPES AND DENIED HIM INFLAMED HIS PASSION AND RESTRAINED IT AND WOUND HIM IN HER TOILS DAY BY DAY
I CAN'T SAY IT'S EXACTLY COMFORTABLE ARE YOU COLD IT IS PRETTY CHILLY
EVERY SILVER LINING HAS A CLOUD BEHIND IT AS THE POET SAYS
HE WANTED TO KNOW THE TRUTH OF THIS MATTER
THE BREAD WAS FROM CORN WHICH COULD BE GROWN IN ONLY ONE FAVORED LOCALITY IN THE EARTH AND ONLY A FAVORED FEW COULD GET IT
DID I TELL YOU I HAD AN OFFER FROM BOBBETT AND FANSHAW TO GO INTO THEIR OFFICE AS CONFIDENTIAL CLERK ON A SALARY OF TEN THOUSAND WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE IT ASKED PHILIP TO WHOM A SALARY OF TWO THOUSAND WOULD HAVE SEEMED WEALTH BEFORE HE STARTED ON THIS JOURNEY
SHE HAD NEVER CONTEMPLATED THIS
THE GALLERIES WERE IN COMMOTION IN AN INSTANT THE REPORTERS SWARMED TO THEIR PLACES
A FEW EVENINGS AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE SOUTHERN PHILIP AND HARRY MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A VERY AGREEABLE GENTLEMAN WHOM THEY HAD FREQUENTLY SEEN BEFORE ABOUT THE HOTEL CORRIDORS AND PASSED A CASUAL WORD WITH
HE PACED THE FLOOR ALL DAY HE SCARCELY SLEPT AT NIGHT
NOT THAT PHILIP DID NOT LONG FOR RUTH'S PRESENCE ALL THE SAME
I SELDOM SEE YOU AT A RECEPTION AND WHEN I DO YOU DO NOT USUALLY GIVE ME VERY MUCH OF YOUR ATTENTION I NEVER IMAGINED THAT YOU WISHED IT OR I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO MAKE MYSELF HAPPY IN THAT WAY.--BUT ONE SELDOM GETS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY MORE THAN A SENTENCE TO YOU IN A PLACE LIKE THAT
WHEN A MAN IS GAGED IN PRAH HE AIN'T FRAID O NUFFIN--DEY CAN'T NUFFIN TETCH HIM WELL WHAT DID YOU RUN FOR WELL I--I--MARS CLAY WHEN A MAN IS UNDER DE INFLUENCE OB DE SPERIT HE DO-NO WHAT HE'S BOUT--NO SAH
OF COURSE WE WERE ALL DISTRACTED IN A MOMENT--EVERYBODY WAS FLYING EVERYWHERE AND NOBODY DOING ANYTHING WORTH ANYTHING
BUT SINCE YOU MENTION IT I DON'T KNOW BUT I MIGHT DO SOMETHING IF I WERE ANGRY MY DEAR MISS HAWKINS IF YOU WERE TO GIVE OUT THAT YOU COMPOSED MY SPEECH YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT WAS ONLY YOUR RAILLERY YOUR FONDNESS FOR PUTTING A VICTIM IN THE PILLORY AND AMUSING THE PUBLIC AT HIS EXPENSE
SHE WAS ASTONISHED AND AT FIRST INCREDULOUS
HIS MEN HAD ALREADY LOST FAITH AND HE OFTEN OVERHEARD THEM SAYING IT WAS PERFECTLY PLAIN THAT THERE WAS NO COAL IN THE HILL
I UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY OF THAT
SI I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO
INDEED
NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT SHE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE OFFER
WHY IT IS TELEGRAPHED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND COMMENTED ON AS SOMETHING WONDERFUL IF A CONGRESSMAN VOTES HONESTLY AND UNSELFISHLY AND REFUSES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS POSITION TO STEAL FROM THE GOVERNMENT BUT INSISTED ALICE I SHOULD THINK IT A NOBLE AMBITION TO GO TO CONGRESS IF IT IS SO BAD AND HELP REFORM IT
BUT THERE'S A BIGGER THING THAN THAT YES BIGGER WHY COLONEL YOU CAN'T WANT ANYTHING BIGGER SAID WASHINGTON HIS EYES BLAZING
IT WAS OF STONE FLOOR AND ALL AND TILE ROOF WAS OVEN SHAPED
I KNEW THE SORT OF THING AS SOON AS I PUT MY EYES ON IT PHILIP'S NEXT THOUGHT WAS TO WRITE TO HIS FRIENDS AND ANNOUNCE THEIR GOOD FORTUNE
A BODY COULDN'T EXPECT IT
WITHOUT IT HE WAS A BEGGAR
AFTER THAT PHILIP FOUGHT HIS BATTLE ALONE DAY AFTER DAY AND SLOW WORK IT WAS
WASHINGTON AND THE COLONEL RAN TO THE SPOT AND READ THIS
PEOPLE USED TO WONDER IN THE WINTERS OF 187 AND 187 WHERE THE SPECIALS GOT THAT REMARKABLE INFORMATION WITH WHICH THEY EVERY MORNING SURPRISED THE COUNTRY REVEALING THE MOST SECRET INTENTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT AND HIS CABINET THE PRIVATE THOUGHTS OF POLITICAL LEADERS THE HIDDEN MEANING OF EVERY MOVEMENT
HARRY WAS EQUALLY IN HIS ELEMENT WHETHER INSTRUCTING SQUIRE MONTAGUE ABOUT THE INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL IN MISSOURI THE IMPROVEMENT OF COLUMBUS RIVER THE PROJECT HE AND SOME GENTLEMEN IN NEW YORK HAD FOR MAKING A SHORTER PACIFIC CONNECTION WITH THE MISSISSIPPI THAN THE PRESENT ONE
AT LEAST HE THOUGHT HE SAW THAT AND HALF HINTED AS MUCH TO HARRY WHO FLARED UP AT ONCE
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR VOICES--"DIVISION
OF COURSE THE MERCHANTS FORWARDED THE ORDERS AT ONCE TO NEW YORK--AND NEVER HEARD OF THEM AGAIN
MR JEFF THOMPSON FOR IT WAS THE CAMP OF THIS REDOUBTABLE ENGINEER GAVE THE TRAVELERS A HEARTY WELCOME OFFERED THEM GROUND ROOM IN HIS OWN TENT ORDERED SUPPER AND SET OUT A SMALL JUG A DROP FROM WHICH HE DECLARED NECESSARY ON ACCOUNT OF THE CHILL OF THE EVENING
RANDOM REMARKS HERE AND THERE BEING PIECED TOGETHER GAVE LAURA A VAGUE IMPRESSION OF A MAN OF FINE PRESENCE ABOUT FORTY-THREE OR FORTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE WITH DARK HAIR AND EYES AND A SLIGHT LIMP IN HIS WALK--IT WAS NOT STATED WHICH LEG WAS DEFECTIVE
HER STRENGTH FORSOOK HER WITH HER RAGE AND SHE SANK UPON A CHAIR SOBBING OH
THEN SHE CLOSED THE DEAD EYES AND CROSSED THE HANDS UPON THE BREAST
BUT MR WASHINGTON HAWKINS ONE OF THE HEIRS OBJECTED
PHILIP DETERMINED TO SEE HER AND PUT HIMSELF IN POSSESSION OF THE TRUTH AS HE SUSPECTED IT IN ORDER TO SHOW HARRY HIS FOLLY
LOW FOREHEADS AND HEAVY FACES THEY ALL HAD
THAT RAILROAD'S FETCHING IT
MY UNCLE WANTED ME TO STAY EAST AND GO IN ON THE MOBILE CUSTOM HOUSE WORK UP THE WASHINGTON END OF IT
THAT'S ALL RIGHT--THAT WILL COME
SO THE TRADE FELL THROUGH AND NOW WASHINGTON WAS WAILING BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN SO FOOLISH
THROUGH HIM SHE LEARNED THAT THE HON
THERE IS WEALTH STORED UP FOR YOU THERE--WEALTH THAT IS BOUNDLESS
HE HAD IN FACT DESCENDED SO FAR AND SO LOW THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF WHEN A BOY A SORT OF STREET ARAB IN THAT CITY
AND BESIDES YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PASS THROUGH THE OLD PART OF THE BUILDING AND YOU COULD NOT HELP SEEING MR LINCOLN AS PETRIFIED BY A YOUNG LADY ARTIST FOR $10,000--AND YOU MIGHT TAKE HIS MARBLE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION WHICH HE HOLDS OUT IN HIS HAND AND CONTEMPLATES FOR A FOLDED NAPKIN
I'VE WRITTEN AND OFFERED HIM EMPLOYMENT IN SURVEYING AND EXAMINING THE LAND
WASHINGTON HAWKINS HAD SCARCELY MORE THAN ENTERED UPON THAT DECADE WHICH CARRIES ONE TO THE FULL BLOSSOM OF MANHOOD WHICH WE TERM THE BEGINNING OF MIDDLE AGE AND YET A BRIEF SOJOURN AT THE CAPITAL OF THE NATION HAD MADE HIM OLD
IN ANOTHER DAY THERE WAS A DECIDED IMPROVEMENT
WHATEVER MOVED HER--THE RIDDLE IS AS OLD AS CREATION--SHE SIMPLY LOOKED UP TO PHILIP AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE EVERYTHING AND PHILIP CLASPING BOTH HER HANDS IN HIS AND LOOKING DOWN INTO HER EYES WHICH DRANK IN ALL HIS TENDERNESS WITH THE THIRST OF A TRUE WOMAN'S NATURE OH
BOTH HAD RISEN PHILIP AS IF TO GO AND LAURA IN SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT
A SERVANT CAME TO SUMMON HER TO DINNER
THE OPPORTUNITY WAS LOST NOTHING COULD RESTORE IT
THAT NIGHT THIS EVIL MAN NOBLE CAME TROUBLING ME AGAIN
THE JESTS ABOUT IT CEASED THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO
THE MAIN BODY CARED NOTHING FOR A DEBATE THAT HAD DWINDLED TO A MERE VAPORING OF DULL SPEAKERS AND NOW AND THEN A BRIEF QUARREL OVER A POINT OF ORDER
IN HIS PRAYERS HE REFERRED TO HIM IN THE CANT TERMS WHICH THE SENATOR EMPLOYED PERHAPS UNCONSCIOUSLY AND MISTOOK MAYBE FOR RELIGION AND IN OTHER WAYS BROUGHT HIM INTO NOTICE
ETHAN DOBB CART-DRIVER
HE FOUND ONE AND THEN WENT TO WORK AS ASSISTANT TO AN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER CARRYING A HOD ALL DAY AND STUDYING POLITICS EVENINGS
WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE STATE CAPITAL AT MIDNIGHT MR NOBLE CAME AND HELD A THREE-HOURS CONFERENCE WITH HIM AND THEN AS HE WAS ABOUT LEAVING SAID
BUT THE OFFICER QUESTIONED HIM SUSPICIOUSLY AND ASKED HIM WHO HE WAS
HER PULSES STOOD STILL HER LIMBS QUAKED THE GLADNESS WENT OUT OF HER FACE
HE BEGAN TO KNOW ENOUGH OF MR BOLTON'S AFFAIRS TO BE UNEASY
HE ONLY FOUND ONE LITTLE OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING AGAIN WITH LAURA BEFORE THE EVENING'S FESTIVITIES ENDED AND THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS HIS AIRY SELF-COMPLACENCY FAILED HIM HIS TONGUE'S EASY CONFIDENCE FORSOOK IT IN A GREAT MEASURE AND HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF AN UNHEROIC TIMIDITY
BLESS YOUR HEART YOU DEAR WOMEN LIVE RIGHT IN THE PRESENT ALL THE TIME--BUT A MAN WHY A MAN LIVES IN THE FUTURE BERIAH
YES PHIL AND WE CAN SPARE A GREAT DEAL OF LOVE FOR HER OUR OWN LIVES ARE SO FULL APPENDIX
BEHIND THE HOTEL AND ACROSS THE BRAWLING BROOK WAS ANOTHER LEVEL-TOPPED WOODED RANGE EXACTLY LIKE IT
PRESENTLY HE HAD SAVED UP QUITE A REPERTOIRE OF BRILLIANCIES
JEFF SAYS THAT A RAILROAD IS FOR--THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE PEOPLE AND NOT FOR THE BENEFIT OF GOPHERS
I'VE NEARLY GOT THE LIGHTING PART BUT I WANT TO ATTACH TO IT A HEATING COOKING WASHING AND IRONING APPARATUS
THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC SEEMED TOO LIMITED AND CRAMPED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS
I HAVE HEARD OF HIM OFTEN THROUGH MY AGENTS
SELLERS HAD EXPECTED IT HAD SEEN TOO MANY SUCH MAPS AS HE EXHIBITED ALTHOUGH HIS UNCLE AND SOME OF THE BROKERS LOOKED WITH MORE FAVOR ON THE APPROPRIATION FOR IMPROVING THE NAVIGATION OF COLUMBUS RIVER AND WERE NOT DISINCLINED TO FORM A COMPANY FOR THAT PURPOSE
WHEN HE SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST THE COLONEL TOSSED SIX OR SEVEN DOLLARS IN BILLS ON THE TABLE COUNTED THEM OVER SAID HE WAS A LITTLE SHORT AND MUST CALL UPON HIS BANKER
WIFE DIDN'T LIKE TO SEE ME GOING OFF WITH THAT TRUNK--SHE SAID IT WAS NEARLY CERTAIN TO BE STOLEN WHY WHY
THEY DIDN'T PEAR TO LIVE AT ALL ONLY WHEN THEY WAS TOGETHER LOOKING AT EACH OTHER LOVING ONE ANOTHER
THAT THE FAMILY NAME WAS VAN BRUNT AND THE CHILD'S NAME LAURA
NO THUNDER IT'S A RECEIPT ALLOW ME SAID PHILIP SEEING HOW SERIOUSLY THE COLONEL WAS ANNOYED AND TAKING OUT HIS PURSE
WHEREUPON SHE HAD AT ONCE ENTERED UPON A TIRELESS AND ELABORATE COURSE OF READING AND HAD NEVER SINCE CEASED TO DEVOTE EVERY UNOCCUPIED MOMENT TO THIS SORT OF PREPARATION
TWO MONTHS HAD GONE BY AND THE HAWKINS FAMILY WERE DOMICILED IN HAWKEYE
THE PRODUCT OF A CULTURE ENTIRELY FOREIGN TO HER EXPERIENCE SO MUCH A CHILD IN SOME THINGS SO MUCH A WOMAN IN OTHERS
THE PRESIDENT HAS VARIETY ENOUGH BUT THE QUALITY
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ADVANCE MUCH IN LOVE-MAKING WITH ONE WHO OFFERED NO OBSTACLES HAD NO CONCEALMENTS AND NO EMBARRASSMENTS AND WHOM ANY APPROACH TO SENTIMENTALITY WOULD BE QUITE LIKELY TO SET INTO A FIT OF LAUGHTER
I DID BREAK DOWN FOR A MOMENT AND IN A RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE SINCE I HAD LED UP TO THOSE STATISTICS WITH SOME GRANDEUR
SO SIR SAID RUTH WHEN PHILIP CAME FROM NEW YORK YOU HAVE BEEN ASSISTING IN A PRETTY TRAGEDY
HE IS ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE AND HE IS ALWAYS GETTING THEE INTO TROUBLE
PRESENTLY AT THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF THE LETTERS HE SAW A SIGNATURE THAT RESTORED HIS EQUILIBRIUM
IT WAS DELIGHTFUL
THAT MAN STANDS BEFORE YOU
LAURA WAS NOT MUCH CHANGED
HE COMMENTED UPON HER PARENTAGE
THAT IS TO SAY THE TUNNEL HAD REACHED A POINT IN THE HILL WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLY BEYOND WHERE THE COAL VEIN SHOULD PASS ACCORDING TO ALL HIS CALCULATIONS IF THERE WERE A COAL VEIN THERE
H CONFOUND IT SAID PHILLIP THE NOODLE HAS FALLEN INTO HER TRAP
THE WEST WAS MORE ATTRACTIVE
HE HAS CAPITAL BUT I JUDGED THAT HE WANTED MY EXPERIENCE IN STARTING IF HE WANTS ME TELL HIM I'LL COME AFTER CONGRESS ADJOURNS
NEVER COULD FIND A MAN THAT WOULD FILL THE BILL
SHE HAD A HEADACHE
WHEN PHILIP WAS MISERABLE ABOUT THIS HE ALWAYS TOOK REFUGE WITH ALICE WHO WAS NEVER MOODY AND WHO GENERALLY LAUGHED HIM OUT OF HIS SENTIMENTAL NONSENSE
HE WROTE TO RUTH AS IF HIS FORTUNE WERE ALREADY MADE AND AS IF THE CLOUDS THAT LOWERED OVER THE HOUSE OF BOLTON WERE ALREADY IN THE DEEP BOSOM OF A COAL MINE BURIED
THERE WERE SEVERAL AT MY RECEPTION THE OTHER DAY
BUT NO PART OF ANY INDIVIDUAL'S FACE HAD SEEN A RAZOR FOR A WEEK
IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE JURY WAS COMING IN
BUT RUTH I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I SHOULD WISH I NEVER HAD GOT WELL IF THERE THERE THEE MUST NOT TALK
WE DO SOMEHOW SEEM TO MANAGE TO LIVE ON NEXT YEAR'S CROP OF CORN AND POTATOES AS A GENERAL THING WHILE THIS YEAR IS STILL DRAGGING ALONG BUT SOMETIMES IT'S NOT A ROBUST DIET,--BERIAH
BUT SUPPOSE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CORONER'S JURY IS GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE A VIGILANCE COMMITTEE IN DISGUISE WHO WILL HEAR TESTIMONY FOR AN HOUR AND THEN HANG THE MURDERER ON THE SPOT
IT IS THE CUSTOM
THEY KISSED HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN THE YOUNG AS WELL AS THE ADVANCED IN YEARS THE MARRIED AS WELL AS THE ARDENT SINGLE WOMEN
SOME PEOPLE DAT KIN READ DON'T PEAR TO TAKE NO NOTICE WHEN DEY DO READ WELL UNCLE DAN'L I THINK THAT-----MY
THERE WAS A SAD GATHERING AT THE HAWKINS FIRESIDE THE NEXT NIGHT
THE ELDERS OF THE PARTY WERE NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING THE FACT WHICH ALMOST ALL TRAVELERS TO THE WEST SOON FIND OUT
BUT I TELL YOU IT'S NOT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE I THINK IT IS ANY MATTER WHO HER FATHER WAS OR WHO HE WASN'T EITHER
HE BELONGED TO HER
SHE IS HERE WHAT LITTLE COLOR HAD WANDERED BACK INTO LAURA'S FACE FORSOOK IT AGAIN
FAR FROM IT
THIS IS A GRAVE OFFENSE AND CANNOT BE PASSED OVER IN SILENCE SIR
OH NO SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO OVERWHELMINGLY GRATEFUL AND HAPPY IN HER WHOLE LIFE BEFORE
IT LAY IN A LITTLE HOLLOW WHERE A SMALL STREAM RAN THROUGH A SPARSE GROVE OF YOUNG WHITE OAKS
FACTORIES AND WAREHOUSES IN CAIRO ISPAHAN BAGDAD DAMASCUS JERUSALEM YEDO PEKING BANGKOK DELHI BOMBAY--AND CALCUTTA
AND WITHOUT WAITING TEN DAYS HARDLY TO THINK THE THING OVER THEY ROSE UP AND HURLED AT HIM A RESOLUTION DECLARING THAT THEY DISAPPROVED OF HIS CONDUCT
YES I KNOW
WHATEVER I DO WILL BE FOR THE PUBLIC INTEREST
IT ENABLED HER ALSO TO HAVE HER OWN FAMILY NEAR HER AND TO SEE SOME OF THEM DAILY
YES
YES
YES
YES
WHERE ARE YOU GOING IT MEANS SAID THE OFFICER IN MEASURED WORDS THAT YOU HAVEN'T ANYTHING TO SHOW FOR A LEGAL MARRIAGE AND THAT I AM GOING TO NEW ORLEANS IT'S A LIE GEORGE IT'S A LIE
IT'S ALL RIGHT MY DEAR ALL RIGHT
THE WORDS WERE MUSIC TO HIS EAR
DOES THAT STREAM EMPTY THAT WHY THAT'S GOOSE RUN
DR DOBB AS STRONGLY INSISTED THAT THE WOUND IN THE ABDOMEN CAUSED DEATH
WITH THE OTHER HAWKINS CHILDREN LAURA HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY HAD INHERITED A FORTUNE IN THE TENNESSEE LANDS
AH I'M SORRY I SPOKE SO MY BOY
PROFIT CLEAR OF ALL EXPENSES TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AT THE VERY LOWEST CALCULATION
WHO'S ON WATCH DOWN THERE A HOLLOW UNHUMAN VOICE RUMBLED UP THROUGH THE TUBE IN ANSWER
I FIND WE ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE AND THAT KINDNESS AND GOOD NATURE WEAR AWAY PREJUDICE
SHE DID NOT QUITE BELIEVE HIM FOR SHE SAW THAT HE FEARED HER AND SHE BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT HIS WERE THE PROTESTATIONS OF A COWARD TO GAIN TIME
I MUST CONTRIVE SOMETHING FRESH TO GET BACK TO CONGRESS ON
YOU CAN JUDGE YOURSELVES WHETHER THE TOTTERING REASON EVER RECOVERED ITS THRONE
IT WAS FOUR WEARY DAYS BEFORE THIS JURY WAS MADE UP BUT WHEN IT WAS FINALLY COMPLETE IT DID GREAT CREDIT TO THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE
GEORGE
HE HAD TO WAIT AN HOUR FOR A TRAIN AND WHEN IT DID START IT SEEMED TO GO AT A SNAIL'S PACE
WOULD THE CLERK TELL HIM THAT A LADY AND GENTLEMAN WISHED TO SEE HIM FOR A MOMENT IN THE PARLOR
AND WHEN THE NEW-COMERS ASCENDED THE LADDER TO THEIR COMFORTABLE FEATHER BEDS ON THE SECOND FLOOR--TO WIT THE GARRET--MRS HAWKINS WAS OBLIGED TO SAY
NOT THAT HE WAS WEALTHY WHEN HE FIRST CAME FROM CORK BUT JUST THE REVERSE
GANGS RELIEVED EACH OTHER AND THE TUNNEL WAS EVERY HOUR INCH BY INCH AND FOOT BY FOOT CRAWLING INTO THE MOUNTAIN
I CAN DEPEND ON YOU FOR THAT CAN'T I OH OF COURSE
A MAN CAN'T ASK ANY FAIRER THAN THAT
PRETTY SOON THE TELEGRAMS WILL BEGIN TO RATTLE IN AND THEN YOU'LL SEE MY BOY
DIDN'T UNCLE TELL ME ONLY LAST SATURDAY THAT I MIGHT AS WELL GO DOWN TO ARIZONA AND HUNT FOR DIAMONDS
SHE WAS THE MOST RESTFUL PERSON HE KNEW
BUT THE LETTER CONTAINING THESE PARTICULARS WAS LOST
YOU WANT AN APPOINTMENT
A PART OF THEIR WAY LAY WITH THAT OF GENERAL BOSWELL AND SENATOR DILWORTHY AND INTRODUCTIONS WERE MADE
SHE SELECTED A LARGE NEW ENGLAND SEMINARY OF WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN HEARD PHILIP SPEAK WHICH WAS ATTENDED BY BOTH SEXES AND OFFERED ALMOST COLLEGIATE ADVANTAGES OF EDUCATION
SHE THOUGHT THAT GIVE AND TAKE WAS FAIR PLAY AND THAT TO PARRY AN OFFENSIVE THRUST WITH A SARCASM WAS A NEAT AND LEGITIMATE THING TO DO
IT WILL ALL COME RIGHT IN A LITTLE WHILE
ONE THING ANNOYED HARRY A GREAT DEAL
I SAY YON GRAYSON GET OUT YOUR SIGHTING IRON AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND OLD SELLERS TOWN
PHILOSOPHERS DISPUTE WHETHER IT IS THE PROMISE OF WHAT SHE WILL BE IN THE CARELESS SCHOOL-GIRL THAT MAKES HER ATTRACTIVE THE UNDEVELOPED MAIDENHOOD OR THE MERE NATURAL CARELESS SWEETNESS OF CHILDHOOD
HE KNEW WELL WHAT THEY CONTAINED NEW DIFFICULTIES MORE URGENT DEMANDS FOR MONEY
I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE THROWAWAY THEIR MONEY BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO CONSEQUENTIAL TO TAKE SELLERS ADVICE
GOODNESS HOW DO FIAH AND DE SMOKE DO BELCH UP
FINALLY THE SETTLING OF A WEEKLY ACCOUNT EXHAUSTED HIS MEANS
THE MYSTERY REMAINS AS IMPENETRABLE AS EVER
THE HAWKINSES ARE UNDER THE WEATHER NOW BUT THEIR TENNESSEE PROPERTY IS MILLIONS WHEN IT COMES INTO MARKET OF COURSE COLONEL
ELI BOLTON AND HIS WIFE TALKED OVER RUTH'S CASE AS THEY HAD OFTEN DONE BEFORE WITH NO LITTLE ANXIETY
CALLS LEAVES HER CARD WITH THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER TURNED DOWN AND THEN TAKES HER DEPARTURE
THAT C STANDS FOR CONVINCED WITH ARGUMENT
AND YET HUMAN BEING LIKE SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOW
LAURA AS AN INMATE OF MY FAMILY WAS A MOST EXEMPLARY FEMALE AMIABLE AFFECTIONATE AND TRUTHFUL PERHAPS TOO FOND OF GAIETY AND NEGLECTFUL OF THE EXTERNALS OF RELIGION BUT A WOMAN OF PRINCIPLE
LET ME SEE--WHERE WAS I
I THINK I SHOULD BE WELL TOMORROW IF I THOUGHT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ANY OTHER THY PHYSICIAN THINKS THEE MUSTN'T TALK PHILIP SAID RUTH PUTTING HER FINGER ON HIS LIPS
THE CLERK THEN READ THE INDICTMENT WHICH WAS IN THE USUAL FORM
HE URGED HER NOT TO ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE MR TROLLOP IN ANY WAY AND EXPLAINED THAT WHATEVER SHE MIGHT ATTEMPT IN THAT DIRECTION WOULD SURELY BE USED AGAINST HER AND WITH DAMAGING EFFECT
WELL THEY ARE EVIDENCE THAT I HAVE TAKEN UP SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND IN THIS COUNTY--THINK WHAT AN ENORMOUS FORTUNE IT WILL BE SOME DAY
WHEN MR BIGLER HAD GONE RUTH ASKED HER FATHER ABOUT PHILIP'S CONNECTION WITH THE LAND SCHEME
CLAY HAD ARRIVED PRECEDING WASHINGTON BY ONE DAY AND HE WAS NOW ADDED TO THE CORPS OF WATCHERS
HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND THE SIGNS OF APPROACHING DISSOLUTION MULTIPLIED RAPIDLY
YOU BEING A STRANGER HOW COULD YOU DO OTHERWISE
             "DILWORTHY
HENRY CLAY HAWKINS MILLIONAIRE
I WAS JUST TURNING IN
SELLERS LED THE WAY TO A SALOON ON FOURTH STREET UNDER THE HOTEL AND THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN FELL INTO THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY
HE'D BEEN IN IT ONCE AND HE COULD TOUCH THE CEILING IN THE SIDE AISLE WITH HIS HAND I THINK HE'S JUST HORRID WAS RUTH'S FINAL SUMMARY OF HIM AFTER THE MANNER OF THE SWIFT JUDGMENT OF WOMEN WITH NO CONSIDERATION OF THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
WELL FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS WE THREE NEVER LEFT THAT BEDSIDE ONLY TO TAKE AN HOUR'S NAP AT A TIME
CALM AND UP AND DOING
WHY A MAN CAN'T ANY MORE START A CASE OF RHEUMATISM IN THIS HOUSE THAN HE CAN SHAKE AN OPINION OUT OF A MUMMY
I'LL TAKE IN EVERY FRIEND I'VE GOT THAT'S EVER STOOD BY ME FOR THERE'S ENOUGH FOR ALL AND TO SPARE
SMALL BOTTLES FIFTY CENTS LARGE ONES A DOLLAR
THE SENATOR POSSESSED HIMSELF OF THE FACTS NOT FROM HIS OBSERVATION OF THE GROUND BUT FROM THE LIPS OF COL
BUT YOU CAN RECKON UPON MY HUMBLE SERVICES THIS ASPECT OF THE SUBJECT WAS NOT AGAIN ALLUDED TO
I WILL FIND A WAY TO GET THERE
MRS HAWKINS SAID MR BRAHAM WILL YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO STATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR FINDING LAURA I OBJECT SAID MR MCFLINN
COULD HE NOT GO INTO SOME STATE WHERE IT WOULD NOT TAKE MUCH TIME
I FINALLY GAVE HIM THE TWO PACKAGES OF BILLS
PERHAPS HE THOUGHT A TELEGRAPHIC STATION
NOW JUST LISTEN AT THAT
THE TRAVELERS LANDED AT A LITTLE SETTLEMENT ON THE LEFT BANK AND AT ONCE TOOK HORSES FOR THE CAMP IN THE INTERIOR CARRYING THEIR CLOTHES AND BLANKETS STRAPPED BEHIND THE SADDLES
THEY WERE ALWAYS COMING
THERE'S WORLDS OF MONEY IN IT!--WHOLE WORLDS OF MONEY
IT'S CONFIDENTIAL OLD BOY HE SAID A LITTLE SCHEME WE HAVE HATCHED UP
SELBY ROARED MR BRAHAM IN A VOICE OF THUNDER
THE SENATOR READ HIS DISPATCHES ALOUD AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE
HE IS AN ADMIRABLE WORKER OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL
IT WAS A PURE MEASURE AND THAT SURELY SHOULD RECOMMEND IT IN THESE CORRUPT TIMES
ALL THE CHILDREN WERE PRESENT BUT CLAY
PERSECUTION IS THE ONE THING NEEDFUL NOW--ALL THE OTHER FORCES ARE SECURED
SAYING NOTHING ALOUD SHE SAT WITH HER HANDS IN HER LAP
IS IT AN AMERICAN BOOK MA'M NO IT IS AN AMERICAN REPRINT OF AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION OH
UPON EVERY TABLE WAS LIABLE TO BE A LITTER OF NEW BOOKS FRESH PERIODICALS AND DAILY NEWSPAPERS
THE DOCTOR HAD PAID HIS LAST VISIT AND GONE AWAY WITH THAT DISMAL REMARK TO THE NEAREST FRIEND OF THE FAMILY THAT HE BELIEVED THERE WAS NOTHING MORE THAT HE COULD DO"--A REMARK WHICH IS ALWAYS OVERHEARD BY SOME ONE IT IS NOT MEANT FOR AND STRIKES A LINGERING HALF-CONSCIOUS HOPE DEAD WITH A WITHERING SHOCK
THIS VISIT TO HIS HOUSE BEING ONLY ONE OF THE COLONEL'S HALLUCINATIONS--ONE OF THOSE INSTANT CREATIONS OF HIS FERTILE FANCY WHICH WERE ALWAYS FLASHING INTO HIS BRAIN AND OUT OF HIS MOUTH IN THE COURSE OF ANY CONVERSATION AND WITHOUT INTERRUPTING THE FLOW OF IT
WHY SHE'LL THINK SHE'S A PROPHETESS--AND HANGED IF I DON'T THINK SO TOO--AND YOU KNOW THERE AIN'T ANY COUNTRY BUT WHAT A PROPHET'S AN HONOR TO AS THE PROVERB SAYS
YOU WILL SEE BUT WILL IT BE SOON LAURA IT WILL NOT BE VERY LONG I THINK BUT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO I HAVE REASONS--AND GOOD ONES

AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT A RED GLARE APPEARED IN THE HEAD OF THE CHUTE AND THE AMARANTH CAME SPRINGING AFTER THEM
WE COULD SELL-OUT TOMORROW FOR A HANDSOME SUM
SAYING
YOU ARE LOOKING WELL MR STERLING
MEETING THE TWO FRIENDS IN THE LOBBY ONE EVENING HE ASKED THEM TO GIVE HIM THE TIME AND ADDED
SLOOP NAVIGATION ALL THE WAY PRETTY MUCH DRAINS THIS WHOLE COUNTRY
AND THEN HICKS WENT ON WITH A SERIOUS AIR COLONEL IF YOU REGISTER A LETTER IT MEANS THAT IT IS OF VALUE DOESN'T IT
SENATE
HE WAS TO BE A CLERK IN A REAL ESTATE OFFICE
THE BETTER PART OF HER WOMAN'S NATURE SAW IT
HE TOOK HER HAND AND SHE LET HIM KEEP IT
HE WOULD NOT DO IT FOR ANY OTHER MAN BUT HE HAD CONCEIVED A LIKING FOR NOBLE AND WHERE HE LIKED A MAN HIS HEART YEARNED TO HELP HIM
HERE WAS A LARGER FIELD AND A WIDER COMPETITION BUT STILL SHE SAW THAT MANY EYES WERE UPLIFTED TOWARD HER FACE AND THAT FIRST ONE PERSON AND THEN ANOTHER CALLED A NEIGHBOR'S ATTENTION TO HER
HE WAS NOW ABOUT TO GO TO ILIUM FOR THE SEASON AND HE DID NOT LIKE TO GO WITHOUT SOME ASSURANCE FROM RUTH THAT SHE MIGHT PERHAPS LOVE HIM SOME DAY
MR TROLLOP'S GREAT SPEECH--WHICH SPEECH WAS WRITTEN AND COMPOSED BY MISS LAURA HAWKINS UNDER A SECRET UNDERSTANDING FOR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS--AND THE MONEY HAS NOT BEEN PAID AND I WILL PIN ROUND ABOUT IT NOTES IN MY HANDWRITING WHICH I WILL PROCURE FROM PROMINENT FRIENDS OF MINE FOR THE OCCASION
AND SO I'M GOING TO SWAP ROUND A LITTLE AND SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
WOULD HIS DEVOTION MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOU IN YOUR WASHINGTON LIFE IN RESPECT TO WHAT ASKED LAURA QUICKLY
C ENGRAVED UNDER THE NAME--WHICH SIGNIFIES PAY PARTING CALL BUT ENOUGH OF ETIQUETTE
THOUGH SOCIETY IN WASHINGTON IS MIXED
ONLY TWO OR THREE DAYS HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE FUNERAL WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED WHICH WAS TO CHANGE THE DRIFT OF LAURA'S LIFE SOMEWHAT AND INFLUENCE IN A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE THE FORMATION OF HER CHARACTER
HAGER NEVER SEES ME BUT HE SAYS COME NOW COLONEL NAME YOUR PRICE--I MUST HAVE THAT CLOCK BUT MY GOODNESS I'D AS SOON THINK OF SELLING MY WIFE
BUT JEFF HAD DECLARED THAT IN HIS JUDGMENT THE ONLY PRACTICABLE ROUTE FROM THE POINT THEY THEN STOOD ON WAS TO FOLLOW THE DIVIDE TO STONE'S LANDING AND IT WAS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT TOWN WOULD BE THE NEXT ONE HIT
HEARD A MAN'S VOICE I--CAN'T--I CAN'T GOOD GOD QUITE BEGGIN LIKE
TAKE SOME MORE WATER WASHINGTON--THE MORE WATER YOU DRINK THE BETTER
WHERE IS IT
WORK WHILE CONGRESS IS IN SESSION SAID THE UNEASY SPIRIT FOR IN THE RECESS THERE IS NO WORK AND NO DEVICE
THE GILDED AGE A TALE OF TODAY BY MARK TWAIN AND CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER 1873 PART 1
DID YOU SEE HOPPERSON LAST NIGHT AFTER THE CONGRESSIONAL PRAYER MEETING YES
BOTH OF THESE SERVANTS WERE DRESSED IN DULL BROWN LIVERY THAT HAD SEEN CONSIDERABLE SERVICE
WHAT SHOULD YOU SAY TO HERE HE DROPPED HIS VOICE TO A WHISPER AND LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AROUND TO SEE THAT THERE WERE NO EAVESDROPPERS A THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ACRE
THAT MEANT RELIEF
SOME TILTED BACK HAD ONE OR MORE LEGS DISPOSED UPON THEIR DESKS
SHE MUST COME HERE AND HELP ME BUILD A HOUSE
OH HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS TO SEE THESE RANKS OF SUNNY LITTLE FACES ASSEMBLED HERE TO LEARN THE WAY OF LIFE
I AM NOT WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE FORMS OF PROCEDURE IN THE COURTS OF NEW YORK BUT IN THE WEST SIR IN THE WEST THE JUDGE
HE SAID HE UNDERSTOOD BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS AND ALL THAT SOME MEN WERE WELL ENOUGH WITHOUT BUT AS FOR HIM HE NEVER NEGLECTED THE ORDINANCES OF RELIGION
ALL PARTIES ARE FLATTERED BY IT AND POLITICS ARE FORGOTTEN IN THE PRESENCE OF ONE SO DISTINGUISHED AMONG HIS FELLOWS
YOU'LL GET TO BELIEVING YOUR OWN ROMANCING BY AND BY WELL YOU'LL SEE
THERE IT IS
THE B
EVERYTHING PROMISED SPLENDIDLY BUT THERE WAS A LITTLE DELAY
I SAY WELL TOO WELL SUPPOSE IT WERE A FRAUD--WHICH I FEEL ABLE TO DENY--WOULD IT BE THE FIRST ONE YOU TAKE A BODY'S BREATH AWAY
COLONEL AFTER THE PRESIDENT SIGNS THE BILL GENERAL SIR?--GENERAL WITHOUT A DOUBT
THE FACT OF THE HOMICIDE WAS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED
OPPOSITE AND AT SOME DISTANCE ACROSS THE ROOFS OF LOWER BUILDINGS THE GIRLS SAW A TALL EDIFICE THE LONG UPPER STORY OF WHICH SEEMED TO BE A DANCING HALL
IT WAS REPORTED AROUND AT ONE TIME THAT THAT IS ALL THE DEFENSE THEN SPENT A DAY IN THE EXAMINATION OF MEDICAL EXPERTS IN INSANITY WHO TESTIFIED ON THE EVIDENCE HEARD THAT SUFFICIENT CAUSES HAD OCCURRED TO PRODUCE AN INSANE MIND IN THE PRISONER
HE WAS NOW AT THE CENTRE OF THE MANUFACTURE OF GIGANTIC SCHEMES OF SPECULATIONS OF ALL SORTS OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GOSSIP
SHE WANTED LOVE THIS WOMAN
SOME SHARPENED PENCILS INDOLENTLY
HIS SUPPORT DOESN'T HURT A BILL
I'LL TELEGRAPH MY WIFE
SHE EXALTED HIM TO THE CLOUDS AT ONE TIME AND AT ANOTHER SHE DRAGGED HIM DOWN AGAIN
TO BE SURE YOU CAN BUY NOW AND THEN A SENATOR OR A REPRESENTATIVE BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW IT IS WRONG AND SO THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED OF IT
HE GOT SUNDAY SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED WHEREVER HE COULD
IF YOU ARE CURIOUS AND INQUIRE INTO THIS THING THE CHANCES ARE THAT YOUR LANDLADY WILL BE ILL-NATURED ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THE PERSON AND PROPERTY OF A CONGRESSMAN ARE EXEMPT FROM ARREST OR DETENTION AND THAT WITH THE TEARS IN HER EYES SHE HAS SEEN SEVERAL OF THE PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVES WALK OFF TO THEIR SEVERAL STATES AND TERRITORIES CARRYING HER UNRECEIPTED BOARD BILLS IN THEIR POCKETS FOR KEEPSAKES
I DO NOT KNOW SUCH A PERSON
HENCEFORTH THAT LIFE AND ALL THAT APPERTAINS TO IT ARE AS DEAD TO ME AND AS FAR REMOVED FROM ME AS IF I WERE BECOME A DENIZEN OF ANOTHER WORLD SHE SAID THAT LOVE WAS NOT FOR HER--THE TIME THAT IT COULD HAVE SATISFIED HER HEART WAS GONE BY AND COULD NOT RETURN
AS THE FALL WENT ON AND THE WINTER RUTH DID NOT DISTINGUISH HERSELF GREATLY AT THE FALLKILL SEMINARY AS A STUDENT A FACT THAT APPARENTLY GAVE HER NO ANXIETY AND DID NOT DIMINISH HER ENJOYMENT OF A NEW SORT OF POWER WHICH HAD AWAKENED WITHIN HER
SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY THE EVIDENCE
THERE WERE MANY OTHERS IN WASHINGTON ON THE SAME ERRAND SOME OF THEM WITH CLAIMS AS DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH AS HIS
OF COURSE SHE LIKES WASHINGTON--I'M NOT SUCH A DUMMY AS TO HAVE TO ASK HER THAT
THIS SIGN IS NOT SUFFICIENT THE THOUGHT USUALLY FOLLOWED:--"THERE IS ONE INFALLIBLE SIGN--IF I COULD ONLY STRIKE THAT THREE OR FOUR TIMES IN AS MANY WEEKS HE SAID TO HIMSELF AM I A VISIONARY
I SUPPOSE SENATOR THAT YOU HAVE BECOME ACCLIMATED TO THIS COUNTRY WELL SAID THE VICE-PRESIDENT CROSSING HIS LEGS PULLING HIS WIDE-AWAKE DOWN OVER HIS FOREHEAD CAUSING A PASSING CHICKEN TO HOP QUICKLY ONE SIDE BY THE ACCURACY OF HIS AIM AND SPEAKING WITH SENATORIAL DELIBERATION I THINK I HAVE
NOW HERE YOU ARE WITH YOUR RAILROAD COMPLETE AND SHOWING ITS CONTINUATION TO HALLELUJAH AND THENCE TO CORRUPTIONVILLE
BLESS MY SOUL HOW OFTEN I'VE TOLD SI HAWKINS INSTEAD OF THAT WE HAVE SUFFERED MORE THAN THE DAMNED THEMSELVES SUFFER
WE LABOR SOLELY FOR OUR COUNTRY AND REQUIRE NO REWARD BUT THE LUXURY OF AN APPLAUDING CONSCIENCE

EVEN PHILIP SOON CAUGHT THE PREVAILING SPIRIT
I HONOR MY COUNTRY'S PUBLIC SERVANTS AS MUCH AS ANY ONE CAN
AND THEY WILL WIN THIS TIME
WHAT WOULD THE LAW DO BUT PROTECT HIM AND MAKE ME AN OUTCAST
THAT GENTLEMAN DELIVERED THE YOUNG ASPIRANT FOR A MUSS ONE OF HIS ELEGANT LITTLE LEFT-HANDERS WHICH SO ASTONISHED HIM THAT HE BEGAN TO FEEL FOR HIS SHOOTER
WHY WHAT IS IT SIS
THEY ALL MADE COMPLIMENTARY REFERENCE TO THEIR FRIEND THE SENATOR AND TOLD WHAT A GREAT AND ILLUSTRIOUS MAN HE WAS AND WHAT HE HAD DONE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND FOR RELIGION AND TEMPERANCE AND EXHORTED THE LITTLE BOYS TO BE GOOD AND DILIGENT AND TRY TO BECOME LIKE HIM SOME DAY
AN HOUR AGO HE HAD THOUGHT TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY LASS UNDER HIS PROTECTION AND SHOW HER LIFE AND ENJOY HER WONDER AND DELIGHT--AND HERE SHE WAS IMMERSED IN THE MARVEL UP TO HER EYES AND JUST A TRIFLE MORE AT HOME IN IT THAN HE WAS HIMSELF
I TELL MY WIFE THAT THE POOR MUST BE LOOKED TO
NOW THEN!--MEET HER
CHAPTER LVI
HE WAS GOVERNOR OF ONE OF THE TERRITORIES A WHILE AND WAS VERY SATISFACTORY INDEED HE WAS
IT WOULD BE MORE MONEY IN MY POCKET IN THE END THAN MY BROTHER-IN-LAW WILL GET OUT OF THAT INCORPORATORSHIP FAT AS IT IS
HE WAS A MAN OF PARAMOUNT INFLUENCE AT HOME FOR HE WAS PUBLIC SPIRITED HE WAS CHIEF OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HE HAD AN ADMIRABLE COMMAND OF PROFANE LANGUAGE AND HAD KILLED SEVERAL PARTIES HIS SHIRT FRONTS WERE ALWAYS IMMACULATE
WHILE THERE ARE LEES OF WINE OR DREGS OF BEER I'LL NEVER WANT HER
HERE AND THERE LITTLE KNOTS OF MEMBERS STOOD IN THE AISLES WHISPERING TOGETHER
STANDING BEHIND HIS GUESTS AT TABLE HE HAD AN AIR OF PEREMPTORY PATRONAGE AND THE VOICE IN WHICH HE SHOT OUT THE INQUIRY AS HE SEIZED PHILIP'S PLATE BEEFSTEAK OR LIVER QUITE TOOK AWAY PHILIP'S POWER OF CHOICE
CHAPTER LIII
TOWN LOTS WERE NO LONGER SALABLE TRAFFIC CEASED A DEADLY LETHARGY FELL UPON THE PLACE ONCE MORE THE WEEKLY TELEGRAPH FADED INTO AN EARLY GRAVE THE WARY TADPOLE RETURNED FROM EXILE THE BULLFROG RESUMED HIS ANCIENT SONG THE TRANQUIL TURTLE SUNNED HIS BACK UPON BANK AND LOG AND DROWSED HIS GRATEFUL LIFE AWAY AS IN THE OLD SWEET DAYS OF YORE
NEXT IS THE SASSPARILLA REGION
GREAT WEALTH GAVE A MAN A STILL HIGHER AND NOBLER PLACE IN IT THAN DID OFFICIAL POSITION
IT WAS WHITEWASHED AND CLEAN BUT IT HAD A SLIGHT JAIL ODOR
AND MRS G.--"WHAT MRS H.--"AS TRUE AS I'M SITTING HERE
NO MONEY BUT A MAN WANTS REST A MAN WANTS PEACE--A MAN DON'T WANT TO RIP AND TEAR AROUND ALL THE TIME
THE CLERK HUNTED AROUND AWHILE GLANCING AT ONE TITLE AND THEN ANOTHER BUT APPARENTLY NOT FINDING WHAT HE WANTED
IT IS NOT THE MISSING PAGE LAURA TORE OFF A COUPLE OF LINES FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SHEET
TOWARD MIDNIGHT WHEN SUPPER WAS ANNOUNCED THE CROWD THRONGED TO THE SUPPER ROOM WHERE A LONG TABLE WAS DECKED OUT WITH WHAT SEEMED A RARE REPAST BUT WHICH CONSISTED OF THINGS BETTER CALCULATED TO FEAST THE EYE THAN THE APPETITE
AT LAST MR CHAIRMAN THIS SHAMELESS PERSON HAS ARRIVED AT THE POINT
I AM ALONE IN THE WORLD SINCE I LOST MY WIFE AND I OFTEN LONG FOR THE SOCIETY OF YOUR SEX MISS HAWKINS NOTWITHSTANDING WHAT PEOPLE MAY SAY TO THE CONTRARY IT IS PLEASANT TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT
HANNAH SHOECRAFT TOLD ANOTHER COUSIN THAT FOR HER PART SHE NEVER BELIEVED THAT RUTH HAD SO MUCH MORE MIND THAN OTHER PEOPLE
THE DINING ROOM WAS LONG LOW AND NARROW AND A NARROW TABLE EXTENDED ITS WHOLE LENGTH
SHE WAS VERY GAY NOW AND VERY CELEBRATED AND SHE MIGHT WELL EXPECT TO BE ASSAILED BY MANY KINDS OF GOSSIP
A SHADOW BLURRED THE SUNLIGHT IN NANCY'S FACE--THERE WAS UNEASINESS IN IT AND DISAPPOINTMENT
AND IS SINCERE LOVE SO RARE MR STERLING ASKED LAURA MOVING HER FOOT A LITTLE AND SPEAKING WITH A SHADE OF SARCASM
THAT WAS ALL FINISHED
IN FACT A FLAT-BOAT WAS THERE MOORED BY IT IT'S SETTING POLES LYING ACROSS THE GUNWALES
WHILE SERVING HIS THIRD TERM IN CONGRESS AND WHILE UPON THE POINT OF BEING ELEVATED TO THE SENATE--WHICH WAS CONSIDERED THE SUMMIT OF EARTHLY AGGRANDIZEMENT IN THOSE DAYS--HE HAD YIELDED TO TEMPTATION WHEN IN DISTRESS FOR MONEY WHEREWITH TO SAVE HIS ESTATE
HE THEN THOUGHT HE WOULD SEEK OUT THAT CONDUCTOR LIE IN WAIT FOR HIM AT SOME STATION AND THRASH HIM OR GET THRASHED HIMSELF
HE THEN ASSISTED HER ACROSS FOUND HER A SEAT RECEIVED HER BEWILDERED THANKS AND RETURNED TO HIS CAR
IT IS A VOLUME THAT IS MAKING A DEAL OF TALK JUST NOW AND IS VERY WIDELY KNOWN--EXCEPT AMONG PARTIES WHO SELL IT THE CLERK GLANCED AT HER FACE TO SEE IF A SARCASM MIGHT NOT LURK SOMEWHERE IN THAT OBSCURE SPEECH BUT THE GENTLE SIMPLICITY OF THE BEAUTIFUL EYES THAT MET HIS BANISHED THAT SUSPICION
WELL I WILL GO HOME AND PACK UP--THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO DO HE MOVED OFF MOODILY TOWARD HIS CABIN
FOR INSTANCE MRS A
WE HAVE SUFFERED THE STATE TO HAVE FULL SWING
A BODY LIVES IN PARIS BUT A BODY ONLY STAYS HERE
BUT IF THE GOVERNMENT WILL BUY THIS LAND IT WILL SET UP THE HAWKINS FAMILY--MAKE LAURA AN HEIRESS--AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF BERIAH SELLERS WOULD SET UP HIS CARRIAGE AGAIN
THE MORE SHE THOUGHT OF THESE PEOPLE AND THEIR EXTRAORDINARY TALK THE MORE OFFENSIVE THEY SEEMED TO HER
WHEN ONE DREAMS OF FLIGHT TO PEACEFUL ISLANDS IN THE REMOTE SOLITUDES OF THE SEA OR FOLDS HIS HANDS AND SAYS WHAT IS THE USE OF STRUGGLING AND TOILING AND WORRYING ANY MORE
THIS IS NOT A HISTORY OF FALLKILL NOR OF THE MONTAGUE FAMILY WORTHY AS BOTH ARE OF THAT HONOR AND THIS NARRATIVE CANNOT BE DIVERTED INTO LONG LOITERING WITH THEM
I AM HENRY WORLEY STRIKER OF THE AMARANTH
LAURA SAT ALONE AND COMMUNED WITH HERSELF
MY DEAR SIR I AM OBLIGED TO KNOCK SOME OF YOUR EXPENSES IN THE HEAD--FOR NEVER A CENT WAS PAID A CONGRESSMAN OR SENATOR ON THE PART OF THIS NAVIGATION COMPANY THE PRESIDENT SMILED BLANDLY EVEN SWEETLY ALL THROUGH THIS HARANGUE AND THEN SAID
MUST BE A DEEP WOMAN
WHICH IS NOT THE CASE
WHY HAD HE TAKEN NO STEPS TO FREE HIMSELF
MANY A MAN WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE INDIAN APPROPRIATION AND DEVOTED THE MONEY TO FEEDING AND CLOTHING THE HELPLESS SAVAGES WHOSE LAND HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM BY THE WHITE MAN IN THE INTERESTS OF CIVILIZATION
THERE WERE ALSO OTHER BOOKS--HISTORIES BIOGRAPHIES OF DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE TRAVELS IN FAR LANDS POEMS ESPECIALLY THOSE OF BYRON SCOTT AND SHELLEY AND MOORE WHICH SHE EAGERLY ABSORBED AND APPROPRIATED THEREFROM WHAT WAS TO HER LIKING
MR BOLTON WAS RELIEVED EXACTLY AS A WATER-LOGGED SHIP IS LIGHTENED BY THROWING OVERBOARD THE MOST VALUABLE PORTION OF THE CARGO--BUT THE LEAK WAS NOT STOPPED
AND WHEN HE CAME TO THIS POINT HE BEGAN TO ASK HIMSELF IF HE HAD NOT ACTED VERY MUCH LIKE A FOOL
HARRY BRAGGED ABOUT HIS CONQUEST AS WAS HIS HABIT AND TOOK PHILIP ROUND TO SEE HIS WESTERN PRIZE
FROM THAT--TO THIS
THEY WILL HANG LAURA
WELL THE SENATE ADJOURNED AND LEFT OUR BILL HIGH AND DRY AND I'LL BE HANGED IF I WARN'T OLD SELLERS FROM THAT DAY TILL OUR BILL PASSED THE HOUSE AGAIN LAST WEEK
SEARCH FOR THE SUPPOSED FATHER HAD BEEN CONTINUED BY LACKLAND HAWKINS AND HIMSELF FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT LAURA WAS NOT INFORMED OF IT TILL AFTER THE DEATH OF HAWKINS FOR FEAR OF RAISING FALSE HOPES IN HER MIND
GOODNESS GRACIOUS ALIVE
MR BRAHAM IN HIS CLOSING SPEECH SURPASSED HIMSELF
TAKE DE OLE NIGGAH IF YOU'S GOT TO HAB SOMEBODY.--GOOD LORD GOOD DEAH LORD WE DON'T KNOW WHAH YOU'S A GWYNE TO WE DON'T KNOW WHO YOU'S GOT YO EYE ON BUT WE KNOWS BY DE WAY YOU'S A COMIN WE KNOWS BY DE WAY YOU'S A TILTIN ALONG IN YO CHARYOT O FIAH DAT SOME PO SINNER'S A GWYNE TO KETCH IT
I KNOW YOU WILL LIKE THESE BOOKS MA'M BECAUSE I'VE READ THEM MYSELF AND I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE OH I WAS PERPLEXED--BUT I SEE HOW IT IS NOW
THE BILL IS LOST
THE FEVER AT LENGTH GOT TIRED OF TORMENTING THE STOUT YOUNG ENGINEER WHO LAY SICK AT THE HOTEL AND LEFT HIM VERY THIN A LITTLE SALLOW BUT AN ACCLIMATED MAN
OH YES REPLIED THAT MARTYR TO BUSINESS IT'S ALL WELL ENOUGH IF YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH OF IT BUT IT ONLY HAS ONE OBJECT WHAT IS THAT IF A WOMAN DOESN'T KNOW IT'S USELESS TO TELL HER
BOTH FATHER AND SON WORE THE LONG SINGLE BREASTED COLLARLESS COATS OF THEIR SOCIETY WITHOUT BUTTONS BEFORE OR BEHIND BUT WITH A ROW OF HOOKS AND EYES ON EITHER SIDE IN FRONT
AND WASHINGTON VOLUNTEERED THE STATEMENT THAT SELBY WAS A BLACK-HEARTED VILLAIN
THE FIRST CALL LAURA RECEIVED FROM THE OTHER EXTREMITY OF THE WASHINGTON ARISTOCRACY FOLLOWED CLOSE UPON THE HEELS OF THE ONE WE HAVE JUST BEEN DESCRIBING
YOU SHALL HAVE IT AS SOON AS YOUR VOTE IS RECORDED MR TROLLOP LOOKED DISAPPOINTED
ADMIRABLE ARTICLE SIR--PRESENT FROM A FRIEND IN HONG KONG
WHAT ACCOUNT SHOULD WE RENDER TO HIM OF OUR STEWARDSHIP
I JUST STUCK BY HIM--I HAUNTED HIM--I NEVER LET HIM ALONE TILL HE BUILT IT OF MUD AND STICKS LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE CHIMNEYS IN THIS DISMAL COUNTRY
I DON'T HEAR A WORD YOU SAY THE MAN WAS DISCHARGED
A HOT BOX HAD TO BE COOLED AT WILMINGTON
I SUPPOSE HE WAS ALWAYS IN LOVE WITH SOME GIRL OR ANOTHER AS COLLEGE BOYS ARE
THERE WAS SCARCELY ANY GOOD MOVEMENT IN WHICH THE SENATOR WAS NOT INTERESTED
I STILL HAVE HOPE THAT SOMETHING WILL OCCUR TO RELIEVE ME
WELL THE WONDERFUL TRAGEDY IS DONE AND IT TRANSPIRES THAT I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LATE ELOQUENCE
IF YOU WILL ENTER THE LECTURE FIELD UNDER GOOD AUSPICES YOU WILL CARRY EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU BUT SIR I NEVER LECTURED I HAVEN'T ANY LECTURE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AH MADAM THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE--NO REAL DIFFERENCE
DO YOU LIKE WINTER MISS HAWKINS SHE SAID LIKE AS IF SHE HAD AN IDEA THAT ITS DICTIONARY MEANING WAS APPROVE OF NOT AS WELL AS SUMMER--THOUGH I THINK ALL SEASONS HAVE THEIR CHARMS IT IS A VERY JUST REMARK
DAMNATION GEORGE DAVIS THE PILOT ON WATCH SHOUTED TO THE NIGHT-WATCHMAN ON DECK
I THOUGHT HE WAS SOME GUY FROM PENNSYLVANIA
AT LEAST HE KNEW THAT RUTH'S DELIGHT IN IT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR HIM
AFTER A WHILE THE PEOPLE ELECTED HIM A REPRESENTATIVE TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES AND HE GREW VERY FAMOUS.--NOW TEMPTATIONS ASSAILED HIM ON EVERY HAND
SO TO TAKE UP LIFE AND BEGIN AGAIN WAS NO GREAT EVIL
OH I WARN YOU MY DEAR THERE'S A GOOD TIME COMING AND IT'LL BE RIGHT ALONG BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TOO
HE PUTS ON AN AIR OF LEVITY SOMETIMES BUT THERE AINT A MAN IN THE SENATE KNOWS THE SCRIPTURES AS HE DOES
MCFINGAL CAUGHT HIS EYE
WHEN YOU CAME TO EXAMINE INTO IT
STILL WHAT IS ALL THIS TO ME
YES INDEED
YES INDEED
CHOW
CHOW
HE NEVER WAS SO SUMMONED BUT NONE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCES WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED TO HEAR ANY DAY THAT HE HAD GONE TO PANAMA OR PEORIA OR TO HEAR FROM HIM THAT HE HAD BOUGHT THE BANK OF COMMERCE
IT IS VERY UNPLEASANT
I PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN
I--HAVE--NOT--TOLD--ALL
HARRY WENT BACK TO THE CITY
BUT HOW THEY DO SWARM ABOUT HER
GOODBYE AND THE LAST THE YOUNG FELLOWS SAW OF THE COLONEL HE WAS WAVING HIS HAT AND BEAMING PROSPERITY AND GOOD LUCK
SOME OF THEM CAST A LURID LIGHT UPON THE COLONEL'S CAREER AND REPRESENTED HIS VICTIM AS A BEAUTIFUL AVENGER OF HER MURDERED INNOCENCE
SELBY IS TALKED ABOUT CHAPTER XLI HARRY BRIERLY BECOMES ENTIRELY INFATUATED WITH LAURA--DECLARES HIS LOVE AND GETS LAUGHED AT CHAPTER XLII HOW THE HON MR TROLLOP WAS INDUCED TO VOTE FOR LAURA'S BILL CHAPTER XLIII PROGRESS OF THE BILL IN THE HOUSE CHAPTER XLIV PHILIP IN WASHINGTON--VISITS LAURA CHAPTER XLV THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ILLUSTRATIONS 128.  PLAYING TO WIN 129.  SHE SAID PARDON 130.  "IT'S HE
GO ON WITH THE PRELIMINARIES THAT IS WHAT I AM COMING TO
SUCH DISAPPOINTMENTS SELDOM OCCUR IN NOVELS BUT ARE ALWAYS HAPPENING IN REAL LIFE
BUT HARRY WILL GET IT STARTED ALONG PRESENTLY AND THEN YOU'LL SEE
SOMETIMES THEY CHAFED IN THEIR BONDAGE
LAURA HAD BENT DOWN AND KISSED HER FATHER'S LIPS AS THE SPIRIT LEFT THE BODY
HE SERVED WITH DISTINCTION IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY AND RECEIVED A WOUND IN THE LEG FROM WHICH HE HAS NEVER ENTIRELY RECOVERED BEING OBLIGED TO USE A CANE IN LOCOMOTION
DID RUTH EVER SPEAK OF HIM
IDLE SIR THERE'S MY GARDEN JUST A RUIN OF WEEDS
YOU ARE ALWAYS THE CENTRE OF A GROUP--A FACT WHICH YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED YOURSELF
OF THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES MR NOBLE--"THEN I AM BECOME THE ACKNOWLEDGED REPRESENTATIVE OF A NATION
MAYBE THEY WOULDN'T LIKE TO THINK OF THEIR FATHER IN WASHINGTON
ON THE WALL WERE OCCASIONAL SQUARE-SHAPED INTERRUPTIONS OF THE GENERAL TINT OF THE PLASTER WHICH BETRAYED THAT THERE USED TO BE PICTURES IN THE HOUSE--BUT THERE WERE NONE NOW
AND NOW WE COME TO THE BRIMSTONE REGION--CATTLE RAISED THERE TILL YOU CAN'T REST--AND CORN AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
AT ANY RATE THE LIFE OF THE WORLD FLOWED FREELY INTO THIS HOSPITABLE HOUSE AND THERE WAS ALWAYS SO MUCH TALK THERE OF THE NEWS OF THE DAY OF THE NEW BOOKS AND OF AUTHORS OF BOSTON RADICALISM AND NEW YORK CIVILIZATION AND THE VIRTUE OF CONGRESS THAT SMALL GOSSIP STOOD A VERY POOR CHANCE
HOWEVER HE SUCCEEDED AT LAST
PERHAPS SHE SO THOUGHT IT
IT SEEMED STRANGE TO THEM THAT CAPITALISTS DID NOT FLOCK OUT THERE AND SECURE THIS LAND
HE WAS DESCENDED FROM A LONG LINE OF IRISH KINGS AND HE WAS THE FIRST ONE OF THEM WHO HAD EVER COME INTO HIS KINGDOM--THE KINGDOM OF SUCH BEING THE CITY OF NEW YORK
THEY HAVE SOME PLAN WITH SENATOR DILWORTHY TO CONVERT A LARGE PART OF THEIR PROPERTY TO SOMETHING ANOTHER FOR THE FREEDMEN YOU DON'T SAY SO
AFTER A TIME--IT WAS TOWARD MIDNIGHT NOW--MR HAWKINS ROUSED OUT OF A DOZE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND WAS EVIDENTLY TRYING TO SPEAK
YOU MEAN SAID MR BRAHAM THAT THERE WAS AN UNNATURAL INSANE GLEAM IN HER EYES YES CERTAINLY SAID WASHINGTON IN CONFUSION
J
LAURA WAS HAPPY OR THOUGHT SHE WAS
FOR SUCH A MAN AND SUCH A MAN'S INFLUENCE HE COULD DO MUCH AND FEEL THAT TO HELP SUCH A MAN WOULD BE AN ACT THAT WOULD HAVE ITS REWARD
HE LEANED UPON THE OPEN COFFIN AND LET HIS TEARS COURSE SILENTLY
IT WAS FRUITLESS
LAURA STRAYING INTO HER THESSALY WITH THE YOUTH BRIERLY SLAYS HER OTHER LOVER AND BECOMES THE CHAMPION OF THE WRONGS OF HER SEX
AND A FEW CRITICAL YEARS CAN DECIDE WHETHER HER LIFE IS TO BE FULL OF SWEETNESS AND LIGHT WHETHER SHE IS TO BE THE VESTAL OF A HOLY TEMPLE OR WHETHER SHE WILL BE THE FALLEN PRIESTESS OF A DESECRATED SHRINE
I'VE LOOKED OVER THE GROUND
SHE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN THE MANY SCHEMES WHICH HAD BEEN ABOUT TO LIFT HER FATHER OUT OF ALL HIS EMBARRASSMENTS AND INTO GREAT WEALTH EVER SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD
WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS WELL--I HAVEN'T GOT ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS HAVEN'T ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS EH
A VERY GOOD USE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS LITERATURE WAS ONE OF THEM
AN WARN'T HE A LOOKIN RIGHT AT DIS GANG HEAH AN WARN'T HE JES A REACHIN FOR EM
CAN I GET WELL
DOUBTS FLITTED THROUGH HIS MIND
I ALMOST KNEW I COULD DO IT BUT IT WAS SO TEDIOUS AND TROUBLESOME I QUIT IT I WAS AFRAID OF IT MY BOY
WHAT'S JOLLY ASKED PHILIP LOOKING OUT UPON THE DREARY AND MONOTONOUS WASTE THROUGH WHICH THE SHAKING STEAMBOAT WAS COUGHING ITS WAY
HE IS WELL FAVORED IN PERSON AND WELL LIKED TOO I BELIEVE AND COMES OF ONE OF THE FIRST FAMILIES OF THE VILLAGE
HIT WASN'T NO TIME FOR TO SELL HE SAY SO HE FOTCH IT BACK AGIN LOWIN TO WAIT TELL FALL
THANK GOD FOR THAT
TEN OF THE OPPOSITION WERE CALLED AWAY FROM TOWN ABOUT NOON,(BUT--SO IT IS SAID--ONLY FOR ONE DAY SIX OTHERS ARE SICK BUT EXPECT TO BE ABOUT AGAIN TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY A FRIEND TELLS ME
THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE ANTIQUES IGNORED THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE PARVENUS
IT WILL ARRAIGN TWO OR THREE DOZEN OF ITS MEMBERS OR MAYBE FOUR OR FIVE DOZEN FOR TAKING BRIBES TO VOTE FOR THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER BILL LAST WINTER IT GOES UP INTO THE DOZENS DOES IT WELL YES
IT'S PERFECTLY AWFUL
EXCUSE ME GENTLEMEN--STRANGERS IN ST LOUIS
HE CONFERRED WITH LAURA PRIVATELY
AND HE--WELL HE IS INVITING HER TO THE CONGRESSIONAL PRAYER-MEETING NO DOUBT--BETTER LET OLD DILWORTHY ALONE TO SEE THAT SHE DOESN'T OVERLOOK THAT
IT DID INDEED
MR BOLTON KNEW PERFECTLY WELL FROM SORE EXPERIENCE THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS A MISTAKE IN FIGURES WHEN BIGLER OR SMALL MADE THEM AND HE KNEW THAT HE OUGHT TO SEND THE FELLOW ABOUT HIS BUSINESS
PHILIP IN THIS CASE COULD NOT TELL FROM HARRY'S STORY EXACTLY HOW MUCH ENCOURAGEMENT LAURA HAD GIVEN HIM NOR WHAT HOPES HE MIGHT JUSTLY HAVE OF WINNING HER
ANY DEPARTURE FROM EITHER COLOR OR SHAPE WOULD BE INSTANTLY TAKEN NOTE OF
ALL THE WOMEN AMONG THE SPECTATORS SAW THE TEARS AND WEPT ALSO
WITH A YOUNG FELLOW OF THE HABITS OF PHILIP SUCH INJURIES CANNOT BE COUNTED ON TO TARRY LONG EVEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOVE-MAKING AND PHILIP FOUND HIMSELF GETTING STRONG WITH EVEN DISAGREEABLE RAPIDITY
A WEEK FROM NOW YOU'LL SEE UNCLE YOU AND BROTHER BALAAM ARE BOSOM FRIENDS--WHY DON'T YOU GET HIS PAPER TO PERSECUTE US TOO IT ISN'T WORTH WHILE MY DAUGHTER
WHY DOES THE SENATE STILL STICK TO THIS POMPOUS WORD INVESTIGATION ONE DOES NOT BLINDFOLD ONE'S SELF IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE AN OBJECT MR DILWORTHY APPEARED IN HIS PLACE IN THE SENATE AND OFFERED A RESOLUTION APPOINTING A COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE HIS CASE
THE HEAD ENGINEER OF THE AMARANTH A GRAND SPECIMEN OF PHYSICAL MANHOOD STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET A GHASTLY SPECTACLE AND STRODE TOWARD HIS BROTHER THE SECOND ENGINEER WHO WAS UNHURT
IT IS SAID THAT MANY FAVORERS OF IT WILL DESERT WHEN THE STORM BREAKS UPON THEM FROM THE PUBLIC PRESS THE STORM CAME AND DURING TEN DAYS IT WAXED MORE AND MORE VIOLENT DAY BY DAY
I THOUGHT HE WOULD FLY TO THE FRONT AND BE BRAVE AND NOBLE AND STAND UP FOR ME AGAINST ALL THE WORLD AND DEFY MY ENEMIES AND WITHER THESE GOSSIPS WITH HIS SCORN
VENERABLE MUD-TURTLES CRAWLED UP AND ROOSTED UPON THE OLD LOGS IN THE STREAM THEIR BACKS GLISTENING IN THE SUN THE FIRST INHABITANTS OF THE METROPOLIS TO BEGIN THE ACTIVE BUSINESS OF THE DAY
I SHOULD WORK WITH A GREAT DEAL BETTER HEART RUTH HE SAID THE MORNING HE WAS TAKING LEAVE IF I KNEW YOU CARED FOR ME A LITTLE RUTH WAS LOOKING DOWN
RUTH WOULD CUT OFF HER RIGHT HAND FOR YOU THIS MINUTE PHILIP NEVER NOTICED THAT ALICE'S FACE WAS FLUSHED AND THAT HER VOICE WAS UNSTEADY
IN THE PARTY OF WHICH OUR TRAVELERS FOUND THEMSELVES MEMBERS WAS DUFF BROWN THE GREAT RAILROAD CONTRACTOR AND SUBSEQUENTLY A WELL-KNOWN MEMBER OF CONGRESS
HOLD UP YOUR HEADS
NOW SHE DRESSED ELABORATELY GAVE BUT LITTLE THOUGHT TO THE COST OF THINGS AND WAS VERY WELL FORTIFIED FINANCIALLY
SURELY NO ONE WOULD HAVE PREDICTED WHEN RUTH LEFT PHILADELPHIA THAT SHE WOULD BECOME ABSORBED TO THIS EXTENT AND SO HAPPY IN A LIFE SO UNLIKE THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE DESIRED
PROBABLY THE VIVACIOUS FELLOW NEVER HAD THOUGHT OF IT
MRS HAWKINS AND WASHINGTON WERE IN TEARS AS WERE MANY OF THE SPECTATORS ALSO
BUT WHAT DOES THEE WANT NOW THAT THEE HASN'T I WANT TO BE SOMETHING TO MAKE MYSELF SOMETHING TO DO SOMETHING
I WILL THINK A MOMENT
HARRY AT ONCE FOUND ON LANDING THAT HIS BACK-WOODS CUSTOM WOULD NOT BE NEEDED IN ST LOUIS AND THAT IN FACT HE HAD NEED OF ALL THE RESOURCES OF HIS WARDROBE TO KEEP EVEN WITH THE YOUNG SWELLS OF THE TOWN
THE SUMMER WENT ON WITHOUT MUCH EXCITEMENT FOR RUTH
MR BOLTON HAD ALREADY SMALL'S NOTES FOR A LARGE AMOUNT IN HIS SAFE LABELED DOUBTFUL HE HAD HELPED HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN AND ALWAYS WITH THE SAME RESULT
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE RID OF ME
THE PAPERS WERE BROUGHT AND HELD BEFORE HIM AND THE ANSWERING SMILE THAT FLITTED ACROSS HIS FACE SHOWED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED
WE SHALL NOT BE DETERRED FROM INSISTING THAT THE OUTRAGED LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN LIFE SHALL BE VINDICATED NOW SO THAT A PERSON CAN WALK THE STREETS OR ENTER THE PUBLIC HOUSES AT LEAST IN THE DAY-TIME WITHOUT THE RISK OF A BULLET THROUGH HIS BRAIN
AND RUTH ESCAPED AWAY TO HER ROOM HER HEART SINGING AGAIN AND NOW AS IF IT WOULD BURST FOR JOY PHILIP HAS COME THAT NIGHT PHILIP RECEIVED A DISPATCH FROM HARRY--"THE TRIAL BEGINS TOMORROW CHAPTER LI
I SAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT AN OATH IS FIVE CENTS EXPLAINED THE MAN
HER ENGLISH WAS FAIR ENOUGH AS A GENERAL THING--THOUGH BEING OF NEW YORK ORIGIN SHE HAD THE FASHION PECULIAR TO MANY NATIVES OF THAT CITY OF PRONOUNCING SAW AND LAW AS IF THEY WERE SPELT SAWR AND LAWR
NO REPLY CAME
SHE WOULD MOVE FROM CITY TO CITY LIKE A QUEEN OF ROMANCE LEAVING MARVELING MULTITUDES BEHIND HER AND IMPATIENT MULTITUDES AWAITING HER COMING
DON'T MENTION IT
UND I MAKES NOTING
YOU GET ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS WIFE
MONEY OR BEAUTY WILL OPEN ANY DOOR
SELBY IS GOING ABROAD VERY SOON LAURA STARTED
SHE WAS THINKING
SELLERS WHILE HE WAS IN HAWKEYE
THERE WAS DANGER IN LAURA'S TONE
IT WAS CLEAR ENOUGH THAT HARRY'S DELUSION MUST BE BROKEN UP AND THAT NO SUCH FEEBLE OBSTACLE AS HIS PASSION COULD INTERPOSE WOULD TURN LAURA FROM HER FATE
YOU MIGHT LIKE THAT IT MIGHT BE MORE CHEERFUL THAN YOU ARE AT TIMES RUTH REPLIED WITH A LAUGH
THE SENATOR'S COMMENDATION AT LEAST DID ONE SERVICE FOR HIM IT ELEVATED HIM IN THE OPINION OF HAWKEYE
DAT'S IT UNCLE DAN'L DO YOU RECKON IT WAS THE PRAYER THAT SAVED US SAID CLAY
HE SIMPLY LABORED ON STUBBORNLY AND WITH LITTLE HOPE
I AM SURE IT MUST BE SO
RIGHT GLAD TO SEE YOU MR BRIERLY
NO LAURA SAID
I SHALL NOT MARRY YOUNG AND PERHAPS NOT AT ALL SAID RUTH WITH A LOOK OF VAST EXPERIENCE
AS I WAS SAYING TO--SILENCE IN THE COURT NOW SHE'S BEGUN TO STRIKE
HOW ARE WE GOING TO PAY THEM WHEN YOU DON'T HONOR OUR DRAFTS WHY MY DEAR SIR I CANNOT SEE HOW YOU CAN FIND ANY FAULT WITH US
PRESENTLY SHE THREW THE SPRAY OF BOX FROM HER WITH AN ANNOYED AIR AND SAID
WHAT DID HE THINK THE GOVERNMENT WOULD OFFER
SALARIES COST PRETTY LIVELY
EVIDENTLY HE IS A GENTLEMAN OF CHARACTER AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE CASE CANNOT BE SHUT OUT WITHOUT INCREASING THE ASPECT OF PERSECUTION WHICH THE STATE'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE PRISONER ALREADY HAS ASSUMED THE WRANGLE CONTINUED WAXING HOTTER AND HOTTER
PERHAPS CONTINUED HE WITH A SNEER YOU WOULD DO AS WELL TO WAIT HERE FOR ANOTHER COLONEL LAURA'S BRAIN WHIRLED
POCKET MONEY
THE COLONEL MADE HIS WAY TO THE STAND WITH MAJESTIC YET BLAND DELIBERATION
OF COURSE I MEAN YOUR GREAT BIG METROPOLITAN RELIGIOUS PAPERS THAT KNOW HOW TO SERVE GOD AND MAKE MONEY AT THE SAME TIME--THAT'S YOUR SORT SIR THAT'S YOUR SORT--A RELIGIOUS PAPER THAT ISN'T RUN TO MAKE MONEY IS NO USE TO US SIR AS AN ADVERTISING MEDIUM--NO USE TO ANYBODY--IN OUR LINE OF BUSINESS
BEAUTY HAD FASCINATED HIM BEFORE
IT CHARGED LAURA HAWKINS IN EFFECT WITH THE PREMEDITATED MURDER OF GEORGE SELBY BY SHOOTING HIM WITH A PISTOL WITH A REVOLVER SHOTGUN RIFLE REPEATER BREECH-LOADER CANNON SIX-SHOOTER WITH A GUN OR SOME OTHER WEAPON
I DON'T LIKE HIS CANDOR
UNDER THIS INFLUENCE SHE ENTERED UPON HER STUDIES WITH KEEN ENJOYMENT FINDING FOR A TIME ALL THE RELAXATION SHE NEEDED IN THE CHARMING SOCIAL LIFE AT THE MONTAGUE HOUSE
SELLERS WAS MASTER OF CEREMONIES
AND THEN PRESENTLY IT CHANGES THE TIDE OF PUBLIC OPINION
INDEED SO DILIGENTLY HAD HE APPLIED HIMSELF THAT WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR HIM TO RETURN TO THE WEST HE FELT HIMSELF AT LEAST IN THEORY COMPETENT TO TAKE CHARGE OF A DIVISION IN THE FIELD
WHEN CLAY BADE HIS HOME GOOD-BYE AND SET OUT TO RETURN TO THE FIELD OF HIS LABORS HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HENCEFORTH HE WAS TO HAVE HIS FATHER'S FAMILY ON HIS HANDS AS PENSIONERS
I WOULDN'T HAVE OLD MCDOWELLS KNOW THAT I TOLD ABOUT IT FOR ANYTHING--HE NEVER WOULD SPEAK TO ME AGAIN
LET THE NEWS COME BACK AFTER SHE WAS MARRIED
BUT WHEN HIS CHILDREN CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THEIR POOR APPAREL HE FELT LIKE A TRAITOR AND REFUSED TO SIGN
CATCH ME AT IT
YOU CANNOT WELL ARRIVE AT A PLEASANT INTERMEDIATE HOUR BECAUSE THE RAILWAY CORPORATION THAT KEEPS THE KEYS OF THE ONLY DOOR THAT LEADS INTO THE TOWN OR OUT OF IT TAKE CARE OF THAT
IN LESS THAN A WEEK THIS INDOMITABLE ENGINEER HAD CARRIED HIS MOVING CARAVAN OVER SLUES AND BRANCHES ACROSS BOTTOMS AND ALONG DIVIDES AND PITCHED HIS TENTS IN THE VERY HEART OF THE CITY OF STONE'S LANDING
I SUPPOSE HE WILL PAINT PUB
THOSE BUILDINGS WILL ALL HAVE TO COME DOWN
CONGRESS INTIMATED PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT THEY CONSIDERED HIM ALMOST A STAIN UPON THEIR BODY
AND HE HIMSELF AND ALL THAT HE DID STILL EMITTED AN ODOR OF SANCTITY NOW THAT HE HAD DIVERGED INTO JOURNALISM AND POLITICS
A BEAUTIFUL DEVIL--AND PERFECTLY FEARLESS TOO
DAY AFTER DAY THEY CALLED AT THE HOUSE OSTENSIBLY UPON VISITS OF CONDOLENCE AND THEY PUMPED AWAY AT THE MOTHER AND THE CHILDREN WITHOUT SEEMING TO KNOW THAT THEIR QUESTIONINGS WERE IN BAD TASTE
I'M STILL EXPERIMENTING
THEN WHAT IS IT
NOW SOME PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT ODD THAT BECAUSE YOU WITH THE BUDDING TASTES AND THE INNOCENT ENTHUSIASMS NATURAL TO YOUR TIME OF LIFE ENJOYED THE VAMPIRES AND THE VOLUME OF NURSERY JOKES YOU SHOULD IMAGINE THAT AN OLDER PERSON WOULD DELIGHT IN THEM TOO--BUT I DO NOT THINK IT ODD AT ALL
AND COMING BACK IN A GLOW OF TRIUMPH AS IT WERE AND IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE FREEDOM AND LIFE IN A LIVELY SOCIETY AND IN NEW AND SYMPATHETIC FRIENDSHIP SHE ANTICIPATED PLEASURE IN AN ATTEMPT TO BREAK UP THE STIFFNESS AND LEVELNESS OF THE SOCIETY AT HOME AND INFUSING INTO IT SOMETHING OF THE MOTION AND SPARKLE WHICH WERE SO AGREEABLE AT FALLKILL
I SUPPOSE YOU SELDOM MEET IN SOCIETY NOW THE PEOPLE YOU USED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH TWELVE OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO MRS O.--"OH NO-HARDLY EVER MR O'RILEY KEPT HIS FIRST RUM-MILL AND PROTECTED HIS CUSTOMERS FROM THE LAW IN THOSE DAYS AND THIS TURN OF THE CONVERSATION WAS RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE TO MADAME THAN OTHERWISE
LET THEM TALK--I WILL NOT STOOP TO BE AFFECTED BY IT
MR BRAHAM OPENED THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE
SPENT IN WASHINGTON SAY $191,000 PRINTING ADVERTISING ETC SAY $118,000 CHARITY SAY $16,000      TOTAL $325,000 THE MONEY TO DO THAT WITH COMES FROM APPROPRIATION $200,000 TEN PER CENT ASSESSMENT ON CAPITAL OF $1,000,000 $100,000      TOTAL $300,000 WHICH LEAVES US IN DEBT SOME $25,000 AT THIS MOMENT
I AM TO KEEP HIS SECRET AND HE IS TO SPARE ME IN FUTURE WHEN HE GETS READY TO DENOUNCE THE SUPPORTERS OF THE UNIVERSITY BILL--AND I CAN EASILY BELIEVE HE WILL KEEP HIS WORD ON THIS OCCASION A FORTNIGHT ELAPSED AND THE UNIVERSITY BILL HAD GATHERED TO ITSELF MANY FRIENDS MEANTIME
BUT INSTEAD NO PROVISION IS MADE THERE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE TRAVELING PUBLIC AND HENCE IT IS NOT A MATTER OF SURPRISE THAT COWS SO FREQUENTLY CLIMB ABOARD THAT TRAIN AND AMONG THE PASSENGERS
THEY STARTED IN FRIGHT EVERY TIME THE GAUGE-COCKS SENT OUT AN ANGRY HISS AND THEY QUAKED FROM HEAD TO FOOT WHEN THE MUD-VALVES THUNDERED
THAT WAS ALL
THAT WAS ALL
THAT WAS ALL
THAT WAS ALL
IT WAS A SPRING MORNING AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE INFLUENCE OF IT THAT MADE RUTH A LITTLE RESTLESS SATISFIED NEITHER WITH THE OUT-DOORS NOR THE IN-DOORS
IS THE PATHOS IN THE EYES OF THE BEATRICE CENCI FROM HER GUILT OR HER INNOCENCE
IF I COULD ONLY GO BACK AND BE AS I WAS THEN FOR ONE HOUR--AND HOLD MY FATHER'S HAND IN MINE AGAIN AND SEE ALL THE HOUSEHOLD ABOUT ME AS IN THAT OLD INNOCENT TIME--AND THEN DIE
OH WHY
THE COLONEL SAID HE MIGHT BE RIGHT BUT HE HAD NEVER NOTICED ANYTHING VISIONARY ABOUT HIM
HE GOT AS FAR AS THE DOOR--AND THEN STRUGGLED BACK TO TAKE ONE MORE LOOK HATING HIMSELF ALL THE WHILE FOR HIS WEAKNESS
LAURA PUT HER ARMS ABOUT HER MOTHER'S NECK AND SAID
AND BY THE TIME THEY HAD RESUMED THEIR SEATS THE LINE WHICH THEY HAD DELIVERED TO THE OPERATOR HAD BEEN READ IN TELEGRAPHIC OFFICES IN TOWNS AND CITIES HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY
TO LEARN TO BE PIOUS
I WILL DEPOSIT THE MONEY IN A BANK AND SEND A CHECK FOR IT TO MY FRIEND THROUGH THE MAIL VERY WELL
IT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN OUT OF MY HANDS AND BEEN INJURED
AS LONG AS IT AVERAGES AS WELL AS THAT I THINK WE CAN FEEL VERY WELL SATISFIED
THIS IS THE EXACT SPIRIT AND MEANING OF THE RESOLUTION AND THE COMMITTEE CANNOT TRY ANYBODY BUT MR NOBLE WITHOUT OVERSTEPPING ITS AUTHORITY
AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HE HAD THE MOST CHEERFUL CONFIDENCE THAT HE HAD DONE A GOOD DAY'S WORK
SHE REELED AWAY FROM THE PLATFORM REACHED THE ANTE-ROOM AND DROPPED HELPLESS UPON A SOFA
HARRY MADE PARTIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH SEVERAL OF THE MERCHANTS FOR FURNISHING SUPPLIES FOR HIS CONTRACT ON THE SALT LICK PACIFIC EXTENSION
THE PRECIPITATING OF THIS CASUAL INTERCOURSE INTO THE MORE SUBSTANTIAL FORM OF AN ACQUAINTANCESHIP WAS THE WORK OF THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF AND OCCURRED IN THIS WISE
THE OLD LADY SAID TO HAWKINS
SHE MUST DO SOMETHING
ALICE WHO WAS NOT MUCH FRIGHTENED WHILE THE PANIC LASTED IN THE HALL WAS VERY MUCH UNNERVED BY SEEING PHILIP SO PALE AND BLOODY
THE QUESTION ANNOYED HIM A LITTLE IN MR BOLTON'S PRESENCE
IN MID-WINTER AN EVENT OCCURRED OF UNUSUAL INTEREST TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE MONTAGUE HOUSE AND TO THE FRIENDS OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHO SOUGHT THEIR SOCIETY
MR SPEAKER MR SPEAKER MR SPEAKER ORDER
HE COULD INDEED RECALL TO MIND ONE WOMAN--AND HE NEVER KNEW A NOBLER--WHOSE WHOLE SOUL WAS DEVOTED AND WHO BELIEVED THAT HER LIFE WAS CONSECRATED TO A CERTAIN BENEVOLENT PROJECT IN SINGLENESS OF LIFE WHO YIELDED TO THE TOUCH OF MATRIMONY AS AN ICICLE YIELDS TO A SUNBEAM
SEEMED TO BE IN LOVE I WAS SURE OF IT
HE CARELESSLY REMARKED TO THE LANDLORD THAT HE WAS NOT THAT DAY IN FUNDS BUT HE WOULD DRAW ON NEW YORK AND HE SAT DOWN AND WROTE TO THE CONTRACTORS IN THAT CITY A GLOWING LETTER ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF THE ROAD AND ASKED THEM TO ADVANCE A HUNDRED OR TWO UNTIL HE GOT AT WORK
AND WHEN THE SENATOR WAS OUT OF HEARING HE CALLED HIM AN OLD FOOL FIE SAID LAURA I DO BELIEVE YOU ARE JEALOUS HARRY
I WON'T EQUIVOCATE--TO COL
DUM EM SAID HE WHEN HE HAD HEARD THE STORY
HE MUTTERED
HE WOULD GIVE THE $10,000
IT'S ALWAYS SUNRISE WITH THAT MAN AND FINE AND BLAZING AT THAT--NEVER GETS NOON THOUGH--LEAVES OFF AND RISES AGAIN
AND ANIMALS
THE SENATOR SPENT SUNDAY IN HAWKEYE AND ATTENDED CHURCH
HE'S GOT ENORMOUS LANDED PROPERTY IN TENNESSEE I THINK
AT LEAST THAT IS THE THEORY OF MR BRAHAM
A HALF-INTOXICATED MAN ROSE UP AND THREW SOMETHING WHICH MISSED HER BUT BESPATTERED A CHAIR AT HER SIDE AND THIS EVOKED AN OUTBURST OF LAUGHTER AND BOISTEROUS ADMIRATION
SHE STOOD STEEPED IN REVERIE A WHILE AND THEN SHE SAID
HARRY WITH BLUE EYES FRESH COMPLEXION SILKEN WHISKERS AND CURLY CHESTNUT HAIR WAS AS HANDSOME AS A FASHION PLATE
LAURA WENT TO BED AT LAST WITH A MIND THAT HAD GAINED LARGELY IN TRANQUILITY AND HAD LOST CORRESPONDINGLY IN MORBID ROMANTIC EXALTATION
THE ANNUAL VISITS ARE MADE AND RETURNED WITH PEACEFUL REGULARITY AND BLAND SATISFACTION ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT THE TWO LADIES SHALL ACTUALLY SEE EACH OTHER OFTENER THAN ONCE EVERY FEW YEARS
AND COLONEL WHY DON'T WE EVER SEE YOU AT OUR HOUSE
FAREWELL PHILIP
HARRY SEEMS TO BE HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY BUT THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED--YOU CAN'T MOVE THESE BIG OPERATIONS TO THE TUNE OF FISHER'S HORNPIPE YOU KNOW
NO NOW LET THAT LUGGAGE ALONE
AH WELL AS I WAS SAYING WHEN--SHE'S BEGINNING AGAIN
THE RIVER ASTONISHED THE CHILDREN BEYOND MEASURE
HE MADE BEFORE HE WENT ELSEWHERE A SOMEWHAT PAINFUL VISIT TO PHILADELPHIA PAINFUL BUT YET NOT WITHOUT ITS SWEETNESSES
HANG THE FELLOW I DO BELIEVE HE HAS GONE WILDER THAN EVER BUT STILL A BODY CAN'T HELP LIKING HIM IF THEY WOULD--AND WHAT IS MORE THEY DON'T EVER WANT TO TRY WHEN THEY SEE HIS EYES AND HEAR HIM TALK WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO THE HAWKINSES WERE COMFORTABLY DOMICILED IN A NEW LOG HOUSE AND WERE BEGINNING TO FEEL AT HOME
NOW YOU KNOW THAT WHEN PROVIDENCE SHAPES A MOUTH ESPECIALLY FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF A POTATO YOU CAN DETECT THAT FACT AT A GLANCE WHEN THAT MOUTH IS IN REPOSE--FOREIGN TRAVEL CAN NEVER REMOVE THAT SIGN
THE TIME WAS GONE BY TO PRODUCE AN EFFECT WITH THEM BUT I HEAR THAT OTHER FRIENDS OF THE SOLDIERS PENSION BILL DESIRE THEM VERY MUCH
IS HE GOING TO START A DAILY NEWSPAPER AMONG THE KICK-A-POOS FATHER THEE'S UNJUST TO PHILIP
I DID WANT YOU--I DO WANT YOU TO VOTE FOR IT VOTE FOR A FR--FOR A MEASURE WHICH IS GENERALLY BELIEVED TO BE AT LEAST QUESTIONABLE
EIGHT YEARS ARE NOT MANY IN THE LIFE OF A NATION OR THE HISTORY OF A STATE BUT THEY MAY BE YEARS OF DESTINY THAT SHALL FIX THE CURRENT OF THE CENTURY FOLLOWING
A THIRD NEWSPAPER TOOK UP THE SUBJECT IN A DIFFERENT TONE
HE HAD BEEN PUNISHED
IF HOWEVER SHE HAD ALREADY BECOME WHAT HARRY UNEASILY FELT SHE MIGHT BECOME WAS IT NOT HIS DUTY TO GO TO THE RESCUE OF HIS FRIEND AND TRY TO SAVE HIM FROM ANY RASH ACT ON ACCOUNT OF A WOMAN THAT MIGHT PROVE TO BE ENTIRELY UNWORTHY OF HIM
ONE RIDING BY ON THE OLD GERMANTOWN ROAD AND SEEING A YOUNG GIRL SWINGING IN THE HAMMOCK ON THE PIAZZA AND INTENT UPON SOME VOLUME OF OLD POETRY OR THE LATEST NOVEL WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE ENVIED A LIFE SO IDYLLIC
SHE APPEARED TO BE VERY MUCH EXCITED AT THE WASHINGTON STATION
BUT AT ANY RATE THERE WAS MUCH ASTONISHMENT MIXED WITH IT
YOU MAY HAVE IT NOW
AND AS SOME OF THESE REPORTS GOT INTO THE NEWSPAPERS OCCASIONALLY HE HAD TO KEEP WRITING TO LOUISE THAT THEY WERE LIES AND SHE MUST BELIEVE IN HIM AND NOT MIND THEM OR ALLOW THEM TO GRIEVE HER
COIN HER OUT OF COBWEBS DUST BUT I'LL HAVE HER
ITS MILE-BREADTH OF WATER SEEMED AN OCEAN TO THEM IN THE SHADOWY TWILIGHT AND THE VAGUE RIBAND OF TREES ON THE FURTHER SHORE THE VERGE OF A CONTINENT WHICH SURELY NONE BUT THEY HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE
THERE WAS A LITTLE NEWSPAPER EDITOR FROM PHIL'S NATIVE TOWN THE ASSISTANT ON A PEDDLETONIAN WEEKLY WHO MADE HIS LITTLE ANNUAL JOKE ABOUT THE FIRST EGG LAID ON OUR TABLE AND WHO WAS THE MENIAL OF EVERY TRADESMAN IN THE VILLAGE AND UNDER BONDS TO HIM FOR FREQUENT PUFFS EXCEPT THE UNDERTAKER ABOUT WHOSE EMPLOYMENT HE WAS RECKLESSLY FACETIOUS
TAINT LIKELY ONE OF SI HAWKINS'S CHILDREN WOULD DO THAT--FOR SHE IS THE SAME AS A CHILD OF HIS
HE WAS A HANDSOME MAN OF FORTY AND PERHAPS MORE WITH GRAYISH HAIR AND WHISKERS AND HE WALKED WITH A CANE AS IF HE WERE SLIGHTLY LAME
HIS MONEY WAS RUNNING AWAY FOR ONE THING AND HE LONGED TO GET INTO THE FIELD AND SEE FOR HIMSELF WHAT CHANCE THERE WAS FOR A FORTUNE OR EVEN AN OCCUPATION
HE LACKS ENTERPRISE--NOW ABOUT THAT COLUMBUS RIVER
THERE WAS LESS OSTENTATION THERE THAN IN SOME OTHERS AND PEOPLE LIKED TO GO WHERE THE ATMOSPHERE REMINDED THEM OF THE PEACE AND PURITY OF HOME
WHEN SELLERS AND I GET THAT APPROPRIATION I'LL SHOW YOU AN ESTABLISHMENT IN TOWN AND ANOTHER ON THE HUDSON AND A BOX AT THE OPERA YES IT WILL BE LIKE COL
BUT OUR BUSINESS IS WITH THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE
PHILIP TELLS ME MRS BOLTON SAID THAT EVENING THAT THE MAN BIGLER HAS BEEN WITH THEE AGAIN TO-DAY
WOULD YOU
WITH HIS KIND OF PEOPLE TO RIDE TO-DAY'S NEW INTEREST TO DEATH AND PUT OFF YESTERDAY'S TILL ANOTHER TIME IS NATURE ITSELF
LITTLE STRANGERS
AND FINALLY WHEN ARGUMENT FAILED SHE SAID THE TICKETS COST NEITHER HER NOR ANY ONE ELSE A CENT--SHE HAD TWO OF THEM--SHE NEEDED BUT ONE--AND IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE OTHER SHE WOULD NOT GO WITH HIM
SLAP DOWN THE RAILS AND BRING THE LAND INTO MARKET
CAN YOU READ NO ANY SCRUPLES ABOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT NO HE WAS ABOUT TO BE SWORN WHEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TURNING TO HIM CARELESSLY REMARKED UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF AN OATH OUTSIDE SAID THE MAN POINTING TO THE DOOR
THE WORKMEN WERE CLAMOROUS NOW
IF WE MISTAKE NOT WE HAVE HEARD HER NAME MENTIONED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF THE TENNESSEE LANDS TO THE KNOBS UNIVERSITY THE BILL FOR WHICH PASSED THE HOUSE LAST NIGHT
I'M GOING TO SELL OUT HERE FOR WHATEVER I CAN GET AND BUY A WAGON AND TEAM AND PUT YOU AND THE CHILDREN IN IT AND START ANYWHERE THAT SUITS YOU SUITS ME SI
ARE WE TO BE SHUT OUT FROM SHOWING THAT THE MOTIVE ATTRIBUTED TO US COULD NOT BY REASON OF CERTAIN MENTAL CONDITIONS EXIST
AND WHEN HIS FOOT FINALLY PRESSED HIS OWN THRESHOLD THE VALUE HE HELD THE ENTIRE TENNESSEE PROPERTY AT WAS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS--TWO HUNDRED DOWN AND THE REST IN THREE EQUAL ANNUAL PAYMENTS WITHOUT INTEREST
BUSINESS PROSPERED LITTLE BY LITTLE
MRS BOLTON ONLY ASKED AND THE QUESTION SHOWED THAT SHE WAS NO MERE PROVIDENT THAN HER HUSBAND WHERE HER HEART WAS INTERESTED BUT HAS THEE PROVIDED MONEY FOR PHILIP TO USE IN OPENING THE COAL MINE YES I HAVE SET APART AS MUCH AS IT OUGHT TO COST TO OPEN THE MINE AS MUCH AS WE CAN AFFORD TO LOSE IF NO COAL IS FOUND
SHE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN THE PRISON DAY AND NIGHT IF IT HAD BEEN PERMITTED
THE TREMENDOUS CONFLICT THAT WAS FOUGHT IN THIS GIRL'S SOUL NONE OF THOSE ABOUT HER KNEW AND VERY FEW KNEW THAT HER LIFE HAD IN IT ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ROMANTIC OR STRANGE
WHERE WAS HIS SNEERING IMPERTURBABLE MANNER WITH WHICH HE COULD HAVE MET AND WOULD HAVE MET ANY WOMAN HE HAD WRONGED IF HE HAD ONLY BEEN FOREWARNED
THEN CAME A DAY WHOSE HOURS FILED SLOWLY BY HER EACH LADEN WITH SOME REMNANT SOME REMAINING FRAGMENT OF THE DREADFUL TIME SO LATELY ENDED--A DAY WHICH CLOSING AT LAST LEFT THE PAST A FADING SHORE BEHIND HER AND TURNED HER EYES TOWARD THE BROAD SEA OF THE FUTURE
WELL AFTER THAT HIS LIFE HUNG BY A THREAD FOR AS MUCH AS TEN DAYS AND THE MINUTE HE WAS OUT OF DANGER EMMELINE AND ME JUST WENT TO BED SICK AND WORN OUT
MRS SELLERS LIT A CHEAP SHOWY LAMP WHICH DISSIPATED A GOOD DEAL OF THE GLOOM AND THEN EVERYBODY GATHERED INTO THE LIGHT AND TOOK THE STOVE INTO CLOSE COMPANIONSHIP
DON'T YOU THINK WE WANT CUBA MR HAWKINS I THINK WE WANT IT BAD SAID WASHINGTON
WHEN MORNING CAME THE TRAIN WAS INDUSTRIOUSLY TOILING ALONG THROUGH THE FAT LANDS OF LANCASTER WITH ITS BROAD FARMS OF CORN AND WHEAT ITS MEAN HOUSES OF STONE ITS VAST BARNS AND GRANARIES BUILT AS IF FOR STORING THE RICHES OF HELIOGABALUS
SUPPOSE THE BILL FAILED
YOU SHOULD KNOW THE PLANTER'S PHILIP AND HARRY BOTH SAID THEY SHOULD LIKE TO SEE A HOTEL THAT HAD BEEN SO FAMOUS IN ITS DAY--A CHEERFUL HOSTELRIE PHILIP SAID IT MUST HAVE BEEN WHERE DUELS WERE FOUGHT THERE ACROSS THE DINING-ROOM TABLE
WELL OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HOPED AND BEEN DISAPPOINTED
SHE SHOULD HAVE MONEY SOON
HE WAS THE ONLY MAN THERE THAT REALLY UNDERSTOOD ME
I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING ALMOST
THE SENATE IS FULL OF THEM
THE WINDOWS WERE OPEN AND THE COOL NIGHT WIND CAME IN STRONG ENOUGH TO FLUTTER A WHITE COVERING NOW AND THEN AND TO SHAKE THE LOOSE CASEMENTS
SECOND ENGINEER GOOD
AND MOREOVER I NEVER PAID A DOLLAR FOR ANY MAN'S VOTE AND NEVER PROMISED ONE
SETTLING FINALLY IN MELBOURNE AUSTRALIA HE CEASED TO ROAM BECAME A STEADY-GOING SUBSTANTIAL MERCHANT AND PROSPERED GREATLY
TWO MONTHS SALARY TO YOU TWO OFFICERS AMOUNTS ALTOGETHER TO $2,400--ABOUT ONE-EIGHTH OF YOUR TEN PER CENT
THE DOCTOR FEARS SHE WILL NOT HAVE STRENGTH ENOUGH TO RALLY FROM IT
HIS LAST MISFORTUNE SEEMED TO HAVE LEFT HOPE AND AMBITION DEAD WITHIN HIM
FOOL THAT I AM
SO HE SAID TO HARRY THAT'S YOUR DISADVANTAGE IN BEING SHORT AND HE GAVE ALICE NO REASON TO FEEL DURING THE EVENING THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HIS FIRST CHOICE FOR THE EXCURSION
MR BRAHAM WHO WAS IN SOMETHING OF A PET REMARKED TO MR O'TOOLE THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DECEIVED--THAT JURYMAN WITH THE BROKEN NOSE COULD READ
AND WHEN BERIAH SELLERS PUTS HIS JUDGMENT ON A THING THERE IT IS WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN HARRY'S INTENTIONS WITH REGARD TO LAURA HE SAW MORE AND MORE OF HER EVERY DAY UNTIL HE GOT TO BE RESTLESS AND NERVOUS WHEN HE WAS NOT WITH HER
FOR THE REASON THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO OVERTAKE ONE
BUT WHEN THEIR TURN HAD ARRIVED TO SPEAK THE TITLE COLONEL CAME FROM THEIR LIPS INSTEAD
AND SO AT THE END OF TWO HOURS IT WAS MANIFEST TO HIM THAT HE HAD MADE BUT LITTLE PROGRESS
IS ANYTHING UNCOMMON GOING ON THEY SAY IT WAS VERY EXCITING
AND IT WILL OPEN SOMETHING FOR YOU PHIL
SOME NEW YORK MEN ARE TRYING TO GET ME TO GO INTO IT--BUY UP ALL THE GROWING CROPS AND JUST BOSS THE MARKET WHEN THEY MATURE--AH I TELL YOU IT'S A GREAT THING
I KNOW IT
WEAR THIS COMELY DISGUISE OF VIRTUE BEFORE THE PUBLIC--IT WILL COUNT THERE
IT WOULD BE WICKED THOUGHT PHILIP AND IMPIOUS TO PRAY FOR LUCK
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE THINGS ARE WORKING VERY WELL
FATHER I SHOULD LIKE TO BREAK THINGS AND GET LOOSE WHAT A SWEET-VOICED LITTLE INNOCENT IT WAS TO BE SURE
SHE SAID TO HERSELF I DON'T SIMPLY WANT HIS VOTE UNDER COMPULSION--HE MIGHT VOTE AYE BUT WORK AGAINST THE BILL IN SECRET FOR REVENGE
TAKE THAT!--TAKE IT TO MY WIFE AND TELL HER IT COMES FROM ME BY THE HAND OF MY MURDERER
THEY WANT ME TO GO IN WITH THEM ON THE SLY--AGENT WAS HERE TWO WEEKS AGO ABOUT IT--GO IN ON THE SLY VOICE DOWN TO AN IMPRESSIVE WHISPER NOW AND BUY UP A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN WILD CAT BANKS IN OHIO INDIANA KENTUCKY ILLINOIS AND MISSOURI--NOTES OF THESE BANKS ARE AT ALL SORTS OF DISCOUNT NOW--AVERAGE DISCOUNT OF THE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN IS FORTY-FOUR PER CENT--BUY THEM ALL UP YOU SEE AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG
THE NEXT MORNING THE CAMP MOVED ON FOLLOWED TILL IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT BY THE LISTLESS EYES OF THE GROUP IN FRONT OF THE STORE ONE OF WHOM REMARKED THAT HE'D BE DOGGONED IF HE EVER EXPECTED TO SEE THAT RAILROAD ANY MO HARRY WENT WITH THE COLONEL TO HAWKEYE TO COMPLETE THEIR ARRANGEMENTS A PART OF WHICH WAS THE PREPARATION OF A PETITION TO CONGRESS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE NAVIGATION OF COLUMBUS RIVER
PERHAPS HER MOTHER SAW THIS AND SAW ALSO THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE FRIENDS SOCIETY TO PREVENT HER FROM GROWING MORE AND MORE OPINIONATED
AND SHE MANAGED TO KEEP THE GOOD NEWS TO HERSELF THOUGH IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE MOST CARELESS OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE SEEN BY HER SPRINGING STEP AND HER RADIANT COUNTENANCE THAT SOME FINE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD DESCENDED UPON HER
NEWPORT IS DAMP AND COLD AND WINDY AND EXCESSIVELY DISAGREEABLE SAID THE DAUGHTER BUT IT IS VERY SELECT
AND WHOSO PASSES TO DO EVIL TO THIS FAIR DOMAIN THAT LOOKS TO ME FOR PROTECTION MUST DO SO OVER MY DEAD BODY HE FURTHER SAID THAT IF THIS NOBLE WERE A PURE MAN AND MERELY MISGUIDED HE COULD BEAR IT BUT THAT HE SHOULD SUCCEED IN HIS WICKED DESIGNS THROUGH A BASE USE OF MONEY WOULD LEAVE A BLOT UPON HIS STATE WHICH WOULD WORK UNTOLD EVIL TO THE MORALS OF THE PEOPLE AND THAT HE WOULD NOT SUFFER
BUT AFFAIRS SEEM TO BE SO ARRANGED THAT MONEY IS MOST DIFFICULT TO GET WHEN PEOPLE NEED IT MOST
THE GOVERNMENT FURNISHED IT
MRS HAWKINS SMILED PROUDLY AND KISSED HER SAYING IN A TONE OF FOND REPROOF
LOUISE TOLD LAURA IN CONFIDENCE
HE'S GONE
THE LITTLE WOMAN WILL TELL YOU SO HERSELF
I WILL SEND MY PRIVATE SECRETARY TO YOU AND LET HIM DISCUSS THE SUBJECT WITH YOU AT LENGTH DID HE COPY YOUR SPEECH FOR YOU OF COURSE HE DID
INSTEAD OF THAT HE LET HIM TALK
LORD BLESS YOU HE COULD RATTLE THROUGH THAT HABEAS CORPUS AND SUPERSEDEAS AND ALL THOSE THINGS FOR LAURA ALL BY HIMSELF IF HE WANTED TO WHEN HE GETS BACK I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT SAID WASHINGTON BRIGHTENING BUT IT IS SO
BUT NOW HE WAS DOWN AGAIN AND DEEPER IN THE MIRE THAN EVER
RUMORS OF RUTH'S FRIVOLITY AND WORLDLINESS AT FALLKILL TRAVELED TO PHILADELPHIA IN DUE TIME AND OCCASIONED NO LITTLE UNDERTALK AMONG THE BOLTON RELATIVES
THE STORY THAT RUTH WAS ENGAGED TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN OF FORTUNE IN FALLKILL CAME WITH THE OTHER NEWS AND HELPED TO GIVE POINT TO THE LITTLE SATIRICAL REMARKS THAT WENT ROUND ABOUT RUTH'S DESIRE TO BE A DOCTOR
AND IN TRYING LEARNED TO LOVE HER
A DEEP SILENCE PERVADED THE AIR AND WAS EMPHASIZED AT INTERVALS RATHER THAN BROKEN BY THE HOOTING OF AN OWL THE BAYING OF A DOG OR THE MUFFLED CRASH OF A CARVING BANK IN THE DISTANCE
CAN HE CALL WEDNESDAY AT THREE O'CLOCK P
THOUGH HE COULDN'T HAVE SUNG A SINGLE AIR THROUGH TO SAVE HIMSELF AND HE HADN'T AN EAR TO KNOW WHETHER IT WAS SUNG CORRECTLY
BUT WHEN HE MAKES OF ME BUT A CLOAK TO HIDE HIS DEEPER DESIGNS WHEN HE PROPOSES TO STRIKE THROUGH ME AT THE HEART OF MY BELOVED STATE ALL THE LION IN ME IS ROUSED--AND I SAY HERE I STAND SOLITARY AND ALONE BUT UNFLINCHING UNQUAILING THRICE ARMED WITH MY SACRED TRUST
AND WHEN HE ADVANCES DOWN TO THE FOOT-LIGHTS AND DEFIANTLY INFORMS THE AUDIENCE THAT HE WHO LAYS HIS HAND ON A WOMAN EXCEPT IN THE WAY OF KINDNESS DO WE NOT ALL APPLAUD SO AS TO DROWN THE REST OF THE SENTENCE
YOU REMEMBER CHILD YOUR FATHER ALWAYS ADMIRED THUNDER HE ADORED IT NO DOUBT IT REMINDED HIM OF BATTLE SAID LAURA
AND SO EVERY FOOT THAT THE TUNNEL NOW PROGRESSED SEEMED TO CARRY IT FURTHER AWAY FROM THE OBJECT OF THE SEARCH
AND LEFT HIM TO EXHIBIT HIS MAPS AND PLANS AND TO SHOW THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PUBLIC TREASURY THE CITY OF NAPOLEON AND LEGISLATION FOR THE BENEFIT OFF THE WHOLE COUNTRY
IT WAS A SORT OF TEST TRIAL OF STRENGTH BETWEEN THE LAWYERS
I'LL GO TO SMILING AROUND A LITTLE TOO AND SEE WHAT EFFECT THAT WILL HAVE ON YOU AND HE DID SMILE AROUND A LITTLE AND GOT AS NEAR TO HER AS HE COULD TO WATCH THE EFFECT BUT THE SCHEME WAS A FAILURE--HE COULD NOT GET HER ATTENTION
AT THIS TIME HARRY WAS SUMMONED TO NEW YORK TO ATTEND THE TRIAL OF LAURA HAWKINS
THEY WANTED TO KNOW IF COL
A STONE CRUSHED THROUGH A BLIND WOUNDING LAURA'S FOREHEAD AND SO STUNNING HER THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT FURTHER TRANSPIRED DURING HER FLIGHT
YOU ARE MY MOTHER AND ALWAYS SHALL BE
BEAUTIFUL ROAD
OH YES
OH YES
SHE WORSHIPPED HIM AND WOULD HAVE COUNTED HER LIFE A LITTLE THING TO GIVE HIM IF HE WOULD ONLY LOVE HER AND LET HER FEED THE HUNGER OF HER HEART UPON HIM
SHE TOLD HIM ABOUT HER INVITATION TO WASHINGTON
IT WAS A FULL MINUTE BEFORE LAURA SPOKE
MAJOR LACKLAND HAD ONCE BEEN A MAN OF NOTE IN THE STATE--A MAN OF EXTRAORDINARY NATURAL ABILITY AND AS EXTRAORDINARY LEARNING
THEY TURNED THEIR FIRST ATTENTION TO STRAIGHTENING THE RIVER JUST ABOVE THE LANDING WHERE IT MADE A DEEP BEND AND WHERE THE MAPS AND PLANS SHOWED THAT THE PROCESS OF STRAIGHTENING WOULD NOT ONLY SHORTEN DISTANCE BUT INCREASE THE FALL THEY STARTED A CUT-OFF CANAL ACROSS THE PENINSULA FORMED BY THE BEND AND SUCH ANOTHER TEARING UP OF THE EARTH AND SLOPPING AROUND IN THE MUD AS FOLLOWED THE ORDER TO THE MEN HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN IN THAT REGION BEFORE
HE KNOWS THAT THAT IS TRUE--THERE WILL BE NO NEED THAT I SHOULD SWEAR TO THAT TO MAKE HIM BELIEVE IT
AND NOW
I THOUGHT I COULD PERSUADE YOU
THE FAMILY CONSISTED OF THE SQUIRE AND HIS WIFE A SON AND A DAUGHTER MARRIED AND NOT AT HOME A SON IN COLLEGE AT CAMBRIDGE ANOTHER SON AT THE SEMINARY AND A DAUGHTER ALICE WHO WAS A YEAR OR MORE OLDER THAN RUTH
THE FRAGRANCE OF IT FLOATED TO HER NOSTRILS
RUTH HAD BEEN MORE TRICKSY THAN USUAL THAT DAY AND IN A FLOW OF SPIRITS QUITE INCONSISTENT IT WOULD SEEM IN A YOUNG LADY DEVOTED TO GRAVE STUDIES
MR BRAHAM PAUSED AS IF OVERCOME BY HIS EMOTIONS
THEN THE GAVEL RAPPED TO COMMAND SILENCE WHILE THE NAMES WERE CALLED ON THE AYES AND NAYS
HE WAS THE INVENTOR OF THE FAMOUS AIR TORPEDO WHICH CAME VERY NEAR DESTROYING THE UNION ARMIES IN MISSOURI AND THE CITY OF ST LOUIS ITSELF
IF THIS SENATOR HAD YIELDED TO TEMPTATION AND HAD OFFERED A BRIBE HE WAS A SOILED MAN AND OUGHT TO BE INSTANTLY EXPELLED
HE'S THE CATCH OF THE SEASON
I HAVE BEEN--SO FOOLISH--SO SHORT-SIGHTED
HE THEN TOOK FROM HIS POCKET $2,000 IN BANK BILLS AND HANDED THEM TO NOBLE AND GOT ANOTHER PACKAGE CONTAINING $5,000 OUT OF HIS TRUNK AND GAVE TO HIM ALSO
I FORGOT MYSELF
LAURA HAD GIVEN HERSELF UTTERLY TO HER HUSBAND AND IF HE HAD FAULTS IF HE WAS SELFISH IF HE WAS SOMETIMES COARSE IF HE WAS DISSIPATED SHE DID NOT OR WOULD NOT SEE IT
BUT THEY HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF LAND MINERALS MINES AND ALL THAT
TWO OR THREE GAUNT HOUNDS LAY ASLEEP ABOUT THE THRESHOLD AND LIFTED THEIR HEADS SADLY WHENEVER MRS HAWKINS OR THE CHILDREN STEPPED IN AND OUT OVER THEIR BODIES
PENDING THESE WEIGHTY NEGOTIATIONS PHILIP HAS PERSUADED HARRY TO TAKE A LITTLE RUN UP TO FALLKILL A NOT DIFFICULT TASK FOR THAT YOUNG MAN WOULD AT ANY TIME HAVE TURNED HIS BACK UPON ALL THE LAND IN THE WEST AT SIGHT OF A NEW AND PRETTY FACE AND HE HAD IT MUST BE CONFESSED A FACILITY IN LOVE MAKING WHICH MADE IT NOT AT ALL AN INTERFERENCE WITH THE MORE SERIOUS BUSINESS OF LIFE
HE COULDN'T SHUT HIS EYES TO WHAT HE SAW NOR HIS EARS TO WHAT HE HEARD OF HER
MRS STERLING WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE PHILIP MAKE HIS WAY AMONG SUCH WELL-TO-DO PEOPLE AND SHE WAS SURE THAT NO GOOD FORTUNE COULD BE TOO GOOD FOR HIS DESERTS
LIGHT THE LAMP POLLY DEAR AND LET'S HAVE THINGS CHEERFUL--JUST AS GLAD TO SEE YOU WASHINGTON AS IF YOU'D BEEN LOST A CENTURY AND WE'D FOUND YOU AGAIN BY THIS TIME THE COLONEL WAS CONVEYING A LIGHTED MATCH INTO A POOR LITTLE STOVE
IN THIS CONDITION OF MIND AND BODY THE QUIET OF HER HOME AND THE UNEXCITING COMPANIONSHIP OF THOSE ABOUT HER WERE MORE THAN EVER TIRESOME
I CAN WAIT
LOOK AT THE RAILROAD
UPON THIS HARRY MADE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT AND TOLD PHILIP ALL HE KNEW ABOUT THE SELBY AFFAIR AND LAURA'S TREATMENT OF HIM SOMETIMES ENCOURAGING HIM--AND THEN THROWING HIM OFF AND FINALLY HIS BELIEF THAT SHE WOULD GO TO THE BAD IF SOMETHING WAS NOT DONE TO AROUSE HER FROM HER INFATUATION
THE FONDNESS OF RUTH WHICH WAS SCARCELY DISGUISED FOR THE COMPANY OF AGREEABLE YOUNG FELLOWS WHO TALKED NOTHINGS GAVE ALICE OPPORTUNITY FOR NO END OF BANTER
I WISH I HAD
THIS MAN'S THAT IRON COMPANY HIMSELF--THAT'S WHAT HE IS
AS THE TUNNEL ADVANCED INTO THE ROCK EVERY DAY PROMISED TO BE THE GOLDEN DAY
IT WAS IN A ROUND HAND UNLIKE HER FLOWING STYLE AND IT WAS DIRECTED TO A NUMBER AND STREET IN GEORGETOWN A LADY AT SENATOR DILWORTHY'S WOULD LIKE TO SEE COL
IT CAN'T BE THE BLUE WING
THE TELEGRAMS DID NOT COME FAST ENOUGH
IT HAD SEEMED LIKE SEEING THEIR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD SOLD INTO BANISHMENT
I'VE A GREAT PASSION FOR CORALS--IT'S A PITY THEY'RE GETTING A LITTLE COMMON
AND I DON'T ONCE A MONTH DO I DEAR
I AM SO TIRED AH POOR CHILD DON'T TALK LIKE THAT-CHEER UP--THERE'S DAYLIGHT AHEAD
IT'S HE 131.  REFLECTION 132.  ONCE MORE FACE TO FACE 133.  COL
WHAT SORT OF RUIN DO YOU CALL THAT SI NANCY DO YOU SUPPOSE I LISTENED TO SUCH A PREPOSTEROUS PROPOSITION
BUT I'M PROGRESSING AND BEFORE MANY WEEKS I WAGER THE COUNTRY WILL RING WITH THE FAME OF BERIAH SELLERS INFALLIBLE IMPERIAL ORIENTAL OPTIC LINIMENT AND SALVATION FOR SORE EYES--THE MEDICAL WONDER OF THE AGE
I KNOW EVERY CONGRESSMAN WELL--EVEN FAMILIARLY VERY GOOD
HIS BUSINESS WAS SO CRIPPLED NOW AND SO DERANGED THAT TO LEAVE IT WOULD BE RUIN
A VOICE OUT ON THE DECK SHOUTED
YOU ARE ANGRY WITH ME LAURA SAID HARRY NOT COMPREHENDING IN THE LEAST WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HER MIND
THE PAST HAD SUNK BELOW THE HORIZON AND EXISTED NO MORE FOR HER
I WISH SAID RUTH TO HER FATHER AFTER THE GUEST HAD GONE THAT YOU WOULDN'T BRING HOME ANY MORE SUCH HORRID MEN
WHEN THEY WERE PAID MR O'RILEY'S ADMIRERS GAVE HIM A SOLITAIRE DIAMOND PIN OF THE SIZE OF A FILBERT IN IMITATION OF THE LIBERALITY OF MR WEED'S FRIENDS AND THEN MR O'RILEY RETIRED FROM ACTIVE SERVICE AND AMUSED HIMSELF WITH BUYING REAL ESTATE AT ENORMOUS FIGURES AND HOLDING IT IN OTHER PEOPLE'S NAMES
WASHINGTON WATCHED EVERY MOVE ON THE BOARD AND HE WAS IN A GOOD POSITION TO DO THIS FOR HE WAS CLERK OF THIS COMMITTEE AND ALSO ONE OTHER
THIS WAS ST LOUIS
BUT HE WAS THERE AND THERE WAS NO ESCAPE
ALL RIGHT MY BIRD OF PARADISE IF IT SUITS YOU GO ON
THE CRIPPLED STOVE--THESE THINGS CONSTITUTED THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM
WE'LL BUY THE LANDS EXPLAINED HE ON LONG TIME BACKED BY THE NOTES OF GOOD MEN
ONE MAN WAS GOING TO BUILD A CHIMNEY OUT OF IT
AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOR THAT I WILL STAND THAT HUMAN BULLETIN BOARD IN THE ROTUNDA OF THE CAPITOL AND MAKE HIM STAY THERE A WEEK
WHILE RUTH WAS THUS ABSORBED IN HER NEW OCCUPATION AND THE SPRING WAS WEARING AWAY PHILIP AND HIS FRIENDS WERE STILL DETAINED AT THE SOUTHERN HOTEL
WELL WAS IT A MYTH OR WAS IT A REALITY
WHY HAD SHE NEVER NOTICED BEFORE HOW BLITHESOME THE WORLD WAS HOW JOCUND WITH LOVE
BESIDES PHILIP HATED THE COPYING OF PLEADINGS AND HE WAS CERTAIN THAT A LIFE OF WHEREASES AND AFORESAIDS AND WHIPPING THE DEVIL ROUND THE STUMP WOULD BE INTOLERABLE
HOW DO THEY PROCEED
WAS ANYTHING THE MATTER HE WONDERED
HE LONGED FOR RICHES NOW AS HE HAD NEVER LONGED FOR THEM BEFORE
SELBY TRAMPLED HER LOVE AND HER PRIDE IN THE DUST
THEY TOOK RAILROAD TO ALTON AND THE STEAMBOAT FROM THERE TO ST LOUIS FOR THE CHANGE AND TO HAVE A GLIMPSE OF THE RIVER
YOU LET OTHER FELLOWS MONOPOLIZE YOU IN SOCIETY AND YOU ARE AS INDIFFERENT TO ME AS IF WE WERE STRANGERS CAN I HELP IT IF THEY ARE ATTENTIVE CAN I BE RUDE
YES YOU ARE CORRECT
SHE HAD BEGUN HER OPEN BATTLE
MRS HAWKINS STEPPED INTO THE ROOM
CONFOUND IT SAID PHILIP TO HIMSELF SHE'S IN A PERFECT TWITTER HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO QUARREL WITH HER AND FLING HIMSELF OUT OF THE HOUSE IN TRAGEDY STYLE GOING PERHAPS SO FAR AS TO BLINDLY WANDER OFF MILES INTO THE COUNTRY AND BATHE HIS THROBBING BROW IN THE CHILLING RAIN OF THE STARS AS PEOPLE DO IN NOVELS
WE WON'T TAKE ANY TRICKS OFF OF HIM OLD MAN I WISH I'D A STOPPED FOR HIM THAT'S ALL THE AMARANTH WAS WITHIN THREE HUNDRED YARDS OF THE BOREAS AND STILL GAINING
PINE FORESTS WHEAT LAND CORN LAND IRON COPPER COAL--WAIT TILL THE RAILROADS COME AND THE STEAMBOATS
HER COMMUNICATIONS TO THE REPORTERS WERE STOPPED BY HER LAWYERS AS SOON AS THEY WERE RETAINED AND VISITED HER BUT THIS FACT DID NOT PREVENT--IT MAY HAVE FACILITATED--THE APPEARANCE OF CASUAL PARAGRAPHS HERE AND THERE WHICH WERE LIKELY TO BEGET POPULAR SYMPATHY FOR THE POOR GIRL
I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD EAT ANY THING I CAN'T EAT THAT OH DEAR CONTINUED THE COLONEL IT'S DREADFUL
FORTUNATELY FATHER IS ALREADY OUT OF MEETING SO THEY CAN'T DISCIPLINE HIM
NEXT MONTH WILL SHOW A STATE OF THINGS AND THEN--BURST UP I SUPPOSE BY NO MEANS
THERE IS NO PLAGUE HERE I RECKON SH
IT IS BARELY POSSIBLE THAT THINGS MIGHT HAVE PRESENTLY SETTLED DOWN INTO THEIR OLD RUT AND THE MYSTERY HAVE LOST THE BULK OF ITS ROMANTIC SUBLIMITY IN LAURA'S EYES IF THE VILLAGE GOSSIPS COULD HAVE QUIETED DOWN
ALSO YOUR PRINTED SPEECH IN THE GLOBE SHOWING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ITS BRACKETED HIATUS AND MY FRAGMENT
KEEP ON SHAKING HANDS
WAS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED TO SEE ME ABOUT YOUR INSTINCT IS CORRECT
HE APPEARED TO BE IN GREAT MENTAL AGONY AND FEAR
SHE COULD NOT BUT BE CONSCIOUS OF HER BEAUTY ALSO AND SHE WAS VAIN OF THAT AND CAME TO TAKE A SORT OF DELIGHT IN THE EXERCISE OF HER FASCINATIONS UPON THE RATHER LOUTISH YOUNG MEN WHO CAME IN HER WAY AND WHOM SHE DESPISED
IT CHILLS ME THROUGH TO STEP ON IT
BUT THEY INSIST THAT HE MUST TRAVEL A LITTLE WHEN HE GETS WELL--THEY RECOMMEND A SHORT SEA VOYAGE AND THEY SAY HE CAN BE PERSUADED TO TRY IT IF WE CONTINUE TO KEEP HIM IN IGNORANCE AND PROMISE TO LET HIM SEE L
THERE IS A FAIR BEGINNING OF A WOMAN'S MEDICAL COLLEGE IN THE CITY
GOOD MORNING MISS HAWKINS
I SHOULD THINK QUERIED ALICE YOU WOULD RATHER STAY IN NEW YORK THAN TO TRY THE ROUGH LIFE AT THE WEST YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OF OH ADVENTURE SAYS HARRY I GET TIRED OF NEW YORK
ONCE SHE FOUND A MAN WITH A SCAR ON HIS FOREHEAD AND SHE WAS JUST GOING TO THROW HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS BUT HE STEPPED OUT JUST THEN AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH HIS LEGS
I GUESS WE'VE REALLY GOT IT
I HAD TO TELL HIM SOME OF THE SIDE ARRANGEMENTS SOME OF THE YOU DIDN'T MENTION ME OH NO
BUT SHE HAD LITTLE SOCIETY LESS AND LESS AS SHE GREW OLDER THAT WAS CONGENIAL TO HER AND HER MIND PREYED UPON ITSELF
NO NO
THIS FIRST SELECT RECEPTION TOOK PLACE AT A CABINET MINISTER'S--OR RATHER A CABINET SECRETARY'S MANSION
NOW MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS SIT UP STRAIGHT AND PRETTY--THERE THAT'S IT--AND GIVE ME YOUR ATTENTION AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A POOR LITTLE SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHOLAR I ONCE KNEW.--HE LIVED IN THE FAR WEST AND HIS PARENTS WERE POOR
WE'VE GOT TO ROUND OUT OUR TERRITORY AND WASHINGTON'S FURTHER OBSERVATIONS WERE BROKEN OFF BY LAURA WHO WHISKED HIM OFF TO ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM AND REMINDED HIM THAT THEY MUST MAKE THEIR ADIEUX
LAURA KNOWS HER BUSINESS
HE WAS A HANDSOME SOLDIERLY MAN OF THIRTY YEARS A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND OF DISTINGUISHED FAMILY IF HIS STORY MIGHT BE BELIEVED AND IT WAS EVIDENT A MAN OF THE WORLD AND OF EXTENSIVE TRAVEL AND ADVENTURE
WE LAY OUT A LINE SPOT THE GOOD LAND ENTER IT UP KNOW WHERE THE STATIONS ARE TO BE SPOT THEM BUY LOTS
SIMPLY THAT I MIGHT REMEMBER THAT I HAD ONCE ASSISTED TO DISCOMFORT YOU AND BE REMINDED TO DO SO NO MORE LAURA LOOKED UP AND SCANNED HIS FACE A MOMENT
THE FACT IS MR BOLTON THAT THE PRICE IS RAISED SO HIGH ON UNITED STATES SENATOR NOW THAT IT AFFECTS THE WHOLE MARKET
IT IS PART OF YOUR BUSINESS THEN YES'M WE ALWAYS HELP HOW GOOD IT IS OF YOU
HE WAS CONSEQUENTLY A GREAT FAVORITE IN NEWSPAPER ROW AND WAS OFTEN LOUNGING IN THE OFFICES THERE DROPPING BITS OF PRIVATE OFFICIAL INFORMATION WHICH WERE IMMEDIATELY CAUGHT UP AND TELEGRAPHED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
IF THIS IS WHAT IS MEANT BY WOMEN PRACTICING MEDICINE THOUGHT PHILIP TO HIMSELF I LIKE IT
AND WITH THESE SHE DELIVERED A LIST OF 96 MISSING PERSONS THAT HAD DROWNED OR OTHERWISE PERISHED AT THE SCENE OF THE DISASTER
AND SO YOU WOULDN'T EVEN PART WITH CLAY
WITHIN TWO MINUTES BOTH OF THESE MEN WERE FLYING UP THE PILOTHOUSE STAIRWAY THREE STEPS AT A JUMP
THE GREAT GALLERIES WERE STILL THRONGED--THOUGH ONLY WITH MEN NOW
THE WOMEN COULD NOT RESTRAIN THEIR LONG PENT-UP EMOTIONS
IT IS THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE THING IN THE WORLD
PERHAPS THE BIGGEST THING WE'VE DONE IN THE ADVERTISING LINE WAS TO GET AN OFFICER OF THE U
YOU GAVE IT UP EARLY CHILD
THE SENATOR SAID
THE PROSPECTING CONTINUED DAY AND NIGHT FOR UPWARDS OF A WEEK AND DURING THE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE DAYS THE INDICATIONS GREW MORE AND MORE PROMISING AND THE TELEGRAMS AND LETTERS KEPT MR BOLTON DULY POSTED
AND THEN HE SAW SUCH DAZZLING COMPANY
HE THOUGHT THE OPINION OF THE SECOND OFFICER OF OUR GREAT GOVERNMENT WOULD BE VALUABLE ON THIS POINT
YOU NEVER TOLD ME WHO'S JUST SUPERB GROWLED PHILIP FANCYING THIS TURN OF THE CONVERSATION LESS THAN THE OTHER
BEAR WITH ME WHILE I RELATE IT
AND FINALLY MANY PEOPLE AVERRED THAT WHILE IT WOULD BE EASY TO SELL THE LANDS TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE NEGRO BY RESORTING TO THE USUAL METHODS OF INFLUENCING VOTES SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS UNWILLING TO HAVE SO NOBLE A CHARITY SULLIED BY ANY TAINT OF CORRUPTION--HE WAS RESOLVED THAT NOT A VOTE SHOULD BE BOUGHT
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTIONS OF THE LAW IN SUCH CASES SAID THE JUDGE AND IN OBEDIENCE TO THE DICTATES OF A WISE HUMANITY I HEREBY COMMIT LAURA HAWKINS TO THE CARE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE STATE HOSPITAL FOR INSANE CRIMINALS TO BE HELD IN CONFINEMENT UNTIL THE STATE COMMISSIONERS ON INSANITY SHALL ORDER HER DISCHARGE
HE ISN'T SO OPPOSED TO A SON-IN-LAW WITHOUT A FORTUNE NOW WITHOUT A FORTUNE INDEED
THEN HE GAVE HER THE EXACT TIME AGAIN AND ANXIOUSLY WATCHED HER TURN THE HANDS SLOWLY TILL THEY REACHED THE PRECISE SPOT WITHOUT ACCIDENT OR LOSS OF LIFE AND THEN HE LOOKED AS HAPPY AS A MAN WHO HAD HELPED A FELLOW BEING THROUGH A MOMENTOUS UNDERTAKING AND WAS GRATEFUL TO KNOW THAT HE HAD NOT LIVED IN VAIN
AND ABOUT TO BE LOCKED UP WITH MADMEN
SELLERS WERE BOTH UP EARLY FOR NEITHER OF THEM COULD SLEEP
AS A FINALITY HE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS THAT HE WAS A BAD CITIZEN AND ALSO THAT THE GENERAL LAXITY OF THE TIME AND THE ABSENCE OF A SENSE OF DUTY TOWARD ANY PART OF THE COMMUNITY BUT THE INDIVIDUAL HIMSELF WERE INGRAINED IN HIM AND HE WAS NO BETTER THAN THE REST OF THE PEOPLE
YOU MAY BELIEVE IT SIR AN UNCOMMONLY PLEASANT LODGING
THERE'S PLENTY OF CHANCES
A DARK LITTLE WOMAN RATHER WORN--MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE THOUGH
JUST AS TRUE AS YOU LIVE
THE CHILD IS BORN
JUST OCEANS OF MONEY IN THOSE BRIDGES
HIS LOVELY COUNTRY HOME MUST GO
BUT THEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE DID NOT KNOW THE NAME OF A WITNESS HE COULD SUMMON AND THAT A PERSONAL FIGHT AGAINST A RAILWAY CORPORATION WAS ABOUT THE MOST HOPELESS IN THE WORLD
NO GENTLEMEN I WILL NOT DECEIVE YOU SHE IS NOT AN ORPHAN
THAT HAIL WE HAD AT NAPOLEON WAS WASH HASTINGS WANTING TO COME TO CAIRO--AND WE DIDN'T STOP
HIS WATCH CHAIN WEIGHED A POUND
HE'S JUST SPEAKING TO MRS SCHOONMAKER
AN EXPRESSION OF CONTENTMENT AND PEACE SETTLED UPON ITS FACE THAT TOUCHED THE MOTHER-HEART
IN FRONT OF SOME OF THE HOTELS AND SALOONS THE SIDE WALKS WERE FILLED WITH CHAIRS AND BENCHES--PARIS FASHION SAID HARRY--UPON WHICH PEOPLE LOUNGED IN THESE WARM SPRING EVENINGS SMOKING ALWAYS SMOKING
YOU MUST ANSWER SIR SAID HIS HONOR
PHILIP WHO HAD FORCED THE GIRLS TO KEEP THEIR SEATS SAW IN A FLASH THE NEW DANGER AND SPRANG TO AVERT IT
MR BRAHAM RE-DREW FOR THE JURY THE PICTURE OF LAURA'S EARLY LIFE
WE USED TO HAVE A CALF THAT ET APPLES AND JUST CHAWED UP DISHRAGS LIKE NOTHING AND IF YOU STAY HERE YOU'LL SEE LOTS OF FUNERALS--WON'T HE SIS
I MEET THEM SIR EVERY DAY AND THE MORE I SEE OF THEM THE MORE I ESTEEM THEM AND THE MORE GRATEFUL I AM THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY OF SECURING THEIR SERVICES
YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE MEMBERS DOWN THERE OF COURSE ELSE YOU COULD NOT HAVE WORKED TO SUCH ADVANTAGE I KNOW THEM ALL SIR
I'LL FEEL MY WAY A LITTLE AND SEE THEN SHE SAID ALOUD
I CAN'T GO BACK TO HAWKEYE WELL GO WHERE YOU LIKE
I HAVE LANDED UPON A FOREIGN SHORE AND BURNED MY SHIPS BEHIND ME
IF HE RESPECTED HIMSELF BEFORE HE ALMOST WORSHIPPED BERIAH SELLERS NOW AS A SUPERIOR BEING
HE SAT IN THE FRONT SEAT OF THE GALLERY WITH HIS ARMS AND HIS TIRED BODY OVERFLOWING THE BALUSTRADE--SOUND ASLEEP DEAD TO ALL EXCITEMENTS ALL DISTURBANCES
ONCE SHE STUMBLED ON A STRANGER WITH A GAME LEG
GOOD
THAT SHE HAD FOLLOWED THE DECEASED FROM WASHINGTON TO COMMIT IT
IF I WERE A HANDSOME WOMAN I SHOULDN'T WANT ANY BETTER PLACE THAN THE CAPITAL TO PICK UP A PRINCE OR A FORTUNE THANK YOU REPLIED LAURA
THE WHOLE JOB WAS WORTH AT LEAST A MILLION TO THE COMPANY--IT MIGHT BE MORE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF HE HAD BEGUN THE STUDY OF THE LAW AS SOON AS HE LEFT COLLEGE BUT IT WAS NOT TOO LATE NOW AND BESIDES HE HAD GATHERED SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD
PHILIP HAD TO WALK SOME FIVE MILES BEFORE HE REACHED A LITTLE STATION WHERE HE COULD WAIT FOR A TRAIN AND HE HAD AMPLE TIME FOR REFLECTION
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ONLY IN LOVE WITH THE ILIUM COAL MINE WHICH YOU AND FATHER TALK ABOUT HALF THE TIME THIS IS A SPECIMEN OF PHILIP'S WOOING
SHE FELT THAT EVERYBODY MIGHT BECOME IN TIME LIKE TWO RELATIVES FROM A SHAKER ESTABLISHMENT IN OHIO WHO VISITED THE BOLTONS ABOUT THIS TIME A FATHER AND SON CLAD EXACTLY ALIKE AND ALIKE IN MANNERS
SHE SAID SHE SHOULD BE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET AWAY FROM WASHINGTON
DON'T WAIT FOR SPECIAL INVITATIONS--THAT'S ALL NONSENSE AMONG FRIENDS
SELBY WAS CARRIED AT ONCE TO HIS ROOM AND DR PUFFER THE EMINENT SURGEON WAS SENT FOR
I SHALL FOLLOW YOU TO NEW ORLEANS PERHAPS MY WIFE MIGHT NOT LIKE IT LAURA RAISED HER HEAD HER EYES FLAMED WITH FIRE SHE TRIED TO UTTER A CRY AND FELL SENSELESS ON THE FLOOR
SHE KNEW A WOMAN'S NATURE TOO WELL TO THINK THEM IMPROBABLE BUT SHE ALSO KNEW HOW STEADFAST RUTH WAS IN HER PURPOSES AND THAT AS A BROOK BREAKS INTO RIPPLES AND EDDIES AND DANCES AND SPORTS BY THE WAY AND YET KEEPS ON TO THE SEA IT WAS IN RUTH'S NATURE TO GIVE BACK CHEERFUL ANSWER TO THE SOLICITATIONS OF FRIENDLINESS AND PLEASURE TO APPEAR IDLY DELAYING EVEN AND SPORTING IN THE SUNSHINE WHILE THE CURRENT OF HER RESOLUTION FLOWED STEADILY ON
I AM AFRAID HE SAID TO HIS WIFE THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR HOUSE
THE SUGAR BOWL WILL DO FOR HAWKEYE AND THE RAT TRAP FOR STONE'S LANDING--NAPOLEON I MEAN--AND YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH BETTER NAPOLEON IS LOCATED THAN HAWKEYE
THAT SHE WAS HIGHLY EDUCATED
THERE ARE SOME WAYS OF DOING A THING THAT ARE AS GOOD AS OTHERS WHICH OTHER PEOPLE DON'T HAPPEN TO THINK ABOUT OR DON'T HAVE THE KNACK OF SUCCEEDING IN IF THEY DO HAPPEN TO THINK OF THEM
SHE WAS LOVELY WHEN HE KNEW HER THEN A SIMPLE COUNTRY GIRL
MUCH OF HER READING HAD BEEN OF MODERN WORKS OF FICTION WRITTEN BY HER OWN SEX WHICH HAD REVEALED TO HER SOMETHING OF HER OWN POWERS AND GIVEN HER INDEED AN EXAGGERATED NOTION OF THE INFLUENCE THE WEALTH THE POSITION A WOMAN MAY ATTAIN WHO HAS BEAUTY AND TALENT AND AMBITION AND A LITTLE CULTURE AND IS NOT TOO SCRUPULOUS IN THE USE OF THEM
THERE'S MOUNTAINS OF IRON ORE HERE NANCY--WHOLE MOUNTAINS OF IT
LAURA'S EYES WERE BLAZING FIRE AND HATRED
BUT SOONER OR LATER THEY ALWAYS CAME BACK PENITENT AND WORSHIPING
VERY GOOD INDEED
IT CONSISTED OF THE PLANK PLATFORM ON WHICH HE STOOD A WOODEN HOUSE HALF PAINTED WITH A DIRTY PIAZZA UNROOFED IN FRONT AND A SIGN BOARD HUNG ON A SLANTING POLE--BEARING THE LEGEND HOTEL
NOT MANY TIMES IF THE COURT KNOWS HERSELF
AND PERHAPS NOW AT THIS VERY MOMENT OF HIS TRIUMPH SHE WAS DYING
THEY KNEW HOW INSECURE LIFE HAD BECOME IN THE METROPOLIS
PERHAPS CONTINUED PHILIP WITH A SMILE THE WOMEN WILL HAVE TO VOTE WELL I SHOULD BE WILLING TO IF IT WERE A NECESSITY JUST AS I WOULD GO TO WAR AND DO WHAT I COULD IF THE COUNTRY COULDN'T BE SAVED OTHERWISE SAID ALICE WITH A SPIRIT THAT SURPRISED PHILIP WELL AS HE THOUGHT HE KNEW HER
I ONLY KEPT BACK THE PAGE FOR THE MERE FUN OF THE THING
SIX F BANG
JIM WAS THE OTHER PILOT
IF THE SENATOR HAS REALLY TAKEN HOLD OF THIS MATTER I MAY LOOK FOR THAT INVITATION TO HIS HOUSE AT ANY MOMENT
A BIRD OF PASSAGE IS ALWAYS AT ITS EASE HAVING NO HOUSE TO BUILD AND NO RESPONSIBILITY
BUT NOW HAWKEYE WAS FRIGHTENED
IT HAS NEVER COME TO MY KNOWLEDGE
YET SACRIFICE HE MUST MAKE AND THAT INSTANTLY IN THE HOPE OF SAVING SOMETHING FROM THE WRECK OF HIS FORTUNE
I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM UP TO ILIUM TO SEE IF HE WON'T WORK STEADILY AT ONE THING AND QUIT HIS NONSENSE IS SHE AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE NEWSPAPERS SAY SHE IS I DON'T KNOW SHE HAS A KIND OF BEAUTY--SHE IS NOT LIKE NOT LIKE ALICE WELL SHE IS BRILLIANT
WHY DO YOU TREAT ME SO HE ONCE SAID REPROACHFULLY
ABSO I'VE MADE HIM SWEAR THAT HE'LL WORK FOR US PRE
THIS DWELLING CONSTITUTED ONE-FIFTEENTH OF OBEDSTOWN
LEVY ANOTHER ASSESSMENT OH I SEE
HE WALKED ON AIR NOW
AS PHILIP APPROACHED THE HOTEL HE SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A WILD BEAST CROUCHING ON THE PIAZZA
I HAVE BEEN READING UP SOME EUROPEAN SCIENTIFIC REPORTS--FRIEND OF MINE COUNT FUGIER SENT THEM TO ME--SENDS ME ALL SORTS OF THINGS FROM PARIS--HE THINKS THE WORLD OF ME FUGIER DOES
WHAT WAS ALL THIS FOR AND WHAT DOES IT AMOUNT TO AFTER ALL
I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU HARRY
MUST YOU GO
AND NOW HE'S REELECTED AND I'VE YET TO SEE THE FIRST MAN WHO'S THE BETTER FOR IT YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY ASKED PHILIP THAT HE WENT IN WITHOUT PAYING ANYTHING NOT A CENT NOT A DASH CENT AS I CAN HEAR REPEATED MR BIGLER INDIGNANTLY
YOU NEVER DID ANYTHING OF THE SORT BEFORE LAURA SMILED VERY FAINTLY AND SAID YES IT WAS SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
AH BUT HE WILL
THE ATTORNEY THEN DWELT UPON THE INSECURITY OF LIFE IN THE CITY AND THE GROWING IMMUNITY WITH WHICH WOMEN COMMITTED MURDERS
SEE HERE MR BIGLER MADE SOME FIGURES
CHAPTER XXX
I AM WAITING
THAT IS THE GENTLEMAN NOW SAID LAURA
WE ARE STRONG AND EVERYTHING IS HOT FOR THE CONTEST
SHE SANK UPON THE BED AS SOON AS SHE WAS LEFT ALONE--SHE HAD BEEN SEARCHED BY THE MATRON--AND TRIED TO THINK
CHAPTER LIX
IN FACT HE SAID THAT HE DID NOT SEE WHY A WOMAN SHOULD NOT ENTER THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IF SHE FELT A CALL TO IT
SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND SAID WITH SERIOUS SWEETNESS
SELBY--ENTERED WITH HIS CANE AND THEY LOOKED AT HIM BECAUSE HE STOPPED AS IF SURPRISED AND FRIGHTENED AND MADE A BACKWARD MOVEMENT
THE SPELL IS BROKEN THE LIFE-LONG CURSE IS ENDED HE SAID
THOSE WERE TROUBLOUS DAYS IN HAWKEYE AS WELL AS IN MOST OTHER MISSOURI TOWNS DAYS OF CONFUSION WHEN BETWEEN UNIONIST AND CONFEDERATE OCCUPATIONS SUDDEN MARAUDINGS AND BUSH-WHACKINGS AND RAIDS INDIVIDUALS ESCAPED OBSERVATION OR COMMENT IN ACTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE FILLED THE TOWN WITH SCANDAL IN QUIET TIMES
HE'S ALL FOR PHILANTHROPY FOR BENEFITING THE COLORED RACE
SOMETIMES I DOUBT
BUT NO MATTER
BUT NO MATTER
THOSE BLASTED RIVER THIEVES
IT'S TWENTY MILES ON THE MAP OFF THE STRAIGHT LINE OF THE ROAD YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT IS THE STRAIGHT LINE TILL THE ENGINEERS HAVE BEEN OVER IT
SELLERS WAS BEWILDERED AND WELL NIGH PARALYZED HIMSELF
BOTH HE AND HARRY GOT THE REFUSAL OF MORE THAN ONE PLANTATION AS THEY WENT ALONG AND WROTE URGENT LETTERS TO THEIR EASTERN CORRESPONDENTS UPON THE BEAUTY OF THE LAND AND THE CERTAINTY THAT IT WOULD QUADRUPLE IN VALUE AS SOON AS THE ROAD WAS FINALLY LOCATED
THE PATRIOTIC OLD GENTLEMAN HOWEVER PLANTED SO MUCH POWDER AND SO MANY EXPLOSIVE CONTRIVANCES IN THE ROADS LEADING INTO HAWKEYE AND THEN FORGOT THE EXACT SPOTS OF DANGER THAT PEOPLE WERE AFRAID TO TRAVEL THE HIGHWAYS AND USED TO COME TO TOWN ACROSS THE FIELDS
I'M PREPARED TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER MISS HAWKINS A LIBERAL OFFER,--TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THIRTY NIGHTS LAURA THOUGHT
HE SEEMS ENTIRELY ALONE IN THE WORLD AND HIS HEART IS SO WRAPPED UP IN THIS THING THAT I BELIEVE THAT IF IT PROVED A FALSE HOPE IT WOULD KILL HIM
FINE FELLOW
LAURA STOOD WHILE THE LONG INDICTMENT WAS READ
HIS SMALL SISTER CLOSE UPON FOUR YEARS OF AGE WAS SOPPING CORN-BREAD IN SOME GRAVY LEFT IN THE BOTTOM OF A FRYING-PAN AND TRYING HARD NOT TO SOP OVER A FINGER-MARK THAT DIVIDED THE PAN THROUGH THE MIDDLE--FOR THE OTHER SIDE BELONGED TO THE BROTHER WHOSE MUSINGS MADE HIM FORGET HIS STOMACH FOR THE MOMENT
HER LAST HOPE WAS GONE
GIVE ME A RELIGIOUS PAPER TO ADVERTISE IN EVERY TIME
AT ANY OTHER TIME THE SWING OF THE CARS WOULD HAVE LULLED HIM TO SLEEP AND THE RATTLE AND CLANK OF WHEELS AND RAILS THE ROAR OF THE WHIRLING IRON WOULD HAVE ONLY BEEN CHEERFUL REMINDERS OF SWIFT AND SAFE TRAVEL
OTHERWISE SHE WAS PERCEPTIBLY CHANGED SHE HAD ARRIVED IN A STATE OF GRIEVOUS UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT MANNER OF WOMAN SHE WAS PHYSICALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY AS COMPARED WITH EASTERN WOMEN
MONEY WAS PLENTY FOR EVERY ATTAINABLE LUXURY AND THERE SEEMED TO BE NO DOUBT THAT ITS SUPPLY WOULD CONTINUE AND THAT FORTUNES WERE ABOUT TO BE MADE WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF TOIL
I MUST FIND THAT CHAIRMAN
YES IT WILL BE MILLIONS
JUDGE O'SHAUNNESSY WOULD NOT PROBABLY PAY ANY ATTENTION TO IT IF THERE WERE
HER HEART STOOD STILL HER STRENGTH SEEMED GOING FROM HER LIMBS
WASHINGTON HAWKINS NEW LIFE WAS AN UNCEASING DELIGHT TO HIM
LOOK AT THAT PROVENDER POINTING TO HIS UNEATEN PRISON RATION
I RECKON THERE'S ENOUGH OF THAT TRUCK ALONG IN THERE ON THE LINE OF THE POCKET-KNIFE FROM HAIL COLUMBIA TO HARK-FROM-THE TOMB TO FAT UP ALL THE CONSUMPTIVES IN ALL THE HOSPITALS FROM HALIFAX TO THE HOLY LAND
HIS CAREER HAD NOTHING REMARKABLE IN IT
THEY HAD HAPPENED TO BE LOOKING TOWARDS THE DOOR WHEN THE MAN--COL
THE GALLERIES DISGORGED THEIR BURDEN AND PRESENTLY THE HOUSE WAS SILENT AND DESERTED
LIFE IS ONLY JUST A TROUBLE
I WOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO ADOPT A THOUSAND CHILDREN IF I WANTED TO FOR THERE'S THAT TENNESSEE LAND YOU KNOW--ENOUGH TO MAKE AN ARMY OF THEM RICH
MR TROLLOP YOU WOULD NOT SELL YOUR VOTE ON THAT SUBSIDY BILL--WHICH WAS PERFECTLY RIGHT--BUT YOU ACCEPTED OF SOME OF THE STOCK WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WAS TO STAND IN YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW'S NAME THERE IS NO PR--I MEAN THIS IS UTTERLY GROUNDLESS MISS HAWKINS BUT THE GENTLEMAN SEEMED SOMEWHAT UNEASY NEVERTHELESS
I THOUGHT I MIGHT DO YOU A GOOD TURN THEN AND DEPEND ON YOU TO DO ME ONE BY AND BY
AND I RECKON HE'D HAVE BEEN ALL RIGHT IN CINCINNATI WITH HIS LAMP THAT HE GOT MADE THAT TIME HE GOT A HOUSE FULL OF RICH SPECULATORS TO SEE HIM EXHIBIT ONLY IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS SPEECH IT LET GO AND ALMOST BLEW THE HEADS OFF THE WHOLE CROWD
IT WAS A PROSPEROUS SCHOOL WITH THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS A LARGE CORPS OF TEACHERS MEN AND WOMEN AND WITH A VENERABLE RUSTY ROW OF ACADEMIC BUILDINGS ON THE SHADED SQUARE OF THE TOWN
THE TRIAL HAD NOW LASTED TWO WEEKS
HOWEVER WHO WAS NOT OF AGE WAS MORE UNWORLDLY AND SANCTIMONIOUS THAN HIS FATHER
THAT INSIGNIFICANT SECRETARY OF LEGATION IS--WHY SHE'S SMILING ON HIM AS IF HE--AND NOW ON THE ADMIRAL
WHAT WILL MY WIFE SAY?--OH YES INDEED IT'S SO!--MARRIED ONLY LAST WEEK--LOVELY PERFECTLY LOVELY CREATURE THE NOBLEST WOMAN THAT EVER--YOU'LL LIKE HER NANCY
EVERYBODY THAT'S READ IT LIKES IT"--AND HE INTRUDED IT UNDER HER NOSE
BLESS YOU THEY WON'T KNOW YOU YOU'VE GROWN SO
HE SAID THERE WAS NOW BUT ONE CHANCE OF FINDING COAL AGAINST NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE THAT HE WOULD NOT FIND IT AND SO IT WOULD BE WRONG IN HIM TO MAKE THE REQUEST AND FOOLISH IN MR MONTAGUE TO GRANT IT
I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING GREAT IN BEING A MODEL FOR THE WHOLE CIVILIZED WORLD WASHINGTON YOU DON'T MEAN A MODEL
I WILL MAKE A WAY
THE UNIVERSITY WAS ON FILE FOR ITS THIRD READING THIS DAY AND TO-MORROW WASHINGTON WOULD BE A MILLIONAIRE AND SELLERS NO LONGER IMPECUNIOUS BUT THIS DAY ALSO OR AT FARTHEST THE NEXT THE JURY IN LAURA'S CASE WOULD COME TO A DECISION OF SOME KIND OR OTHER--THEY WOULD FIND HER GUILTY WASHINGTON SECRETLY FEARED AND THEN THE CARE AND THE TROUBLE WOULD ALL COME BACK AGAIN AND THESE WOULD BE WEARING MONTHS OF BESIEGING JUDGES FOR NEW TRIALS
THE CALLERS THIS TIME WERE THE HON
THEN SHE FELL TO CONNING THE TITLES AGAIN FINDING A DELIGHT IN THE INSPECTION OF THE HAWTHORNES THE LONGFELLOWS THE TENNYSONS AND OTHER FAVORITES OF HER IDLE HOURS
FOR PRESENTLY CAME A LETTER FROM WASHINGTON WHICH SAID
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
DAY OF
PERHAPS ALSO RUTH WANTED TO TEST HER OWN NERVE AND TO SEE WHETHER THE POWER OF ASSOCIATION WAS STRONGER IN HER MIND THAN HER OWN WILL
HE WALKED INTO HER TRAP AND HE HAS BEEN PUNISHED FOR IT
NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT INTERESTING--FOR THEY WERE
YOU SEE YOU ARE PREMATURE MR TROLLOP THE WONDERFUL TRAGEDY IS NOT DONE YET BY ANY MEANS
IT AIN'T MANY MONTHS TILL SPRING
GEN
GEN
HARRY'S THERE AND HE'LL DO WHAT HE CAN OF COURSE
ALL THIS WAS OBJECTED TO BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY BUT IT WAS GOT BEFORE THE JURY AND MR BRAHAM DID NOT CARE HOW MUCH IT WAS RULED OUT AFTER THAT
YOU PROBABLY FORGOT THAT YOU HAD IT
SOMETIMES IN COUPLES
OH WHAT IS IT UNCLE DAN'L WITH DEEP SOLEMNITY THE ANSWER CAME
NO PARTICULAR REASON EXCEPT ONE WHICH HE PREFERRED TO KEEP TO HIMSELF--VIZ
THE SEMINARY WAS THE CHIEF FEATURE OF FALLKILL A VILLAGE OF TWO TO THREE THOUSAND INHABITANTS
WERE YOU NOT A LOVER OF MISS HAWKINS OBJECTED TO
IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE HE JUST WENT BOOMING THIS COURSE GAVE HARRY AN OPPORTUNITY AS HE SAID TO LEARN THE PRACTICAL DETAILS OF ENGINEERING AND IT GAVE PHILIP A CHANCE TO SEE THE COUNTRY AND TO JUDGE FOR HIMSELF WHAT PROSPECT OF A FORTUNE IT OFFERED
SHE COULDN'T PICK US UP THIS WAY
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL--AND IT IS ALL BOSH TOO
ANOTHER LETTER SAID THAT THE POOR SOUL BROKE COMPLETELY DOWN WHEN HE SAW LAURA'S PICTURE AND DECLARED IT MUST BE SHE STILL ANOTHER SAID
NOW THE CONTEST RAGED HOTTER THAN EVER--FOR THE AUTHORITY THAT COMPELS ORDER WHEN THE HOUSE SITS AS A HOUSE IS GREATLY DIMINISHED WHEN IT SITS AS COMMITTEE
SO HAS EVERY BODY HERE
I SHALL SHOW YOU THAT WHEN SHE RECOVERED HER HEALTH HER MIND WAS CHANGED SHE WAS NOT WHAT SHE HAD BEEN
AT LENGTH AT THE END OF ONE WEEK WHEN HIS HOTEL BILL WAS PRESENTED HARRY FOUND NOT A CENT IN HIS POCKET TO MEET IT
HE SAW LAURA AGAIN AND AGAIN DURING HIS STAY AND FELT MORE AND MORE THE SUBTLE INFLUENCE OF HER FEMININE BEAUTY WHICH EVERY MAN FELT WHO CAME NEAR HER
ALL CORRECT TOO ALL CORRECT
BUT STILL THE WRANGLE LOST NOTHING OF ITS BITTERNESS
WELL I--IT DON'T SEEM QUITE ENOUGH
WASHINGTON BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC WERE ON HIM ALSO AND HIS EYES ROLLED ABOUT NOW TOWARDS THE CEILING NOW TOWARDS THE FLOOR IN AN EFFORT TO LOOK UNCONSCIOUS
BUT I WANTED YOU SO CLAY IS NOT GOOD FATHER--HE DID NOT CALL ME
WHY NOT SHE SAID WHY SHOULDN'T I DO AS OTHER WOMEN HAVE DONE
IT LOOKS AS IF POLITICS WAS PLAYED OUT
BUT NO ONE CAN TELL HOW A WOMAN WILL ACT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
YES YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT MA'M BUT HE WAS GETTING UNMISTAKABLY UNCOMFORTABLE NOW NOTWITHSTANDING LAURA'S CONFIDING SOCIABILITY AND ALMOST AFFECTIONATE TONE
AMIDST UNPARALLELED EXCITEMENT THE BALLOT WAS NOW TAKEN AND J
LIFE HAS NO MOMENT SO SWEET AS THAT IN WHICH A YOUNG MAN BELIEVES HIMSELF CALLED INTO THE IMMORTAL RANKS OF THE MASTERS OF LITERATURE
DELIGHTED
AND YOU DO LOVE ME A LITTLE THE COLONEL VOWED AND PROTESTED
AND BESIDES AIN'T I GOING TO DO THOSE THINGS
SELLERS SHOULD HAVE BUSINESS THERE
OF IT WE WILL SAY A WORD HERE
BUT TO THINK OF HER LIFE IF SHE IS ACQUITTED IT IS DREADFUL SAID RUTH THOUGHTFULLY BUT THE WORST OF IT IS THAT YOU MEN DO NOT WANT WOMEN EDUCATED TO DO ANYTHING TO BE ABLE TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING BY THEIR OWN EXERTIONS
SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY HER MOTHER AND BY WASHINGTON HAWKINS WHO WERE GIVEN SEATS NEAR HER
PHILIP EVEN WAS EXCITED BY THE SENSE OF FREEDOM AND ADVENTURE AND THE BEAUTY OF THE LANDSCAPE
OF COURSE HE KNEW NOTHING OF HER HISTORY
THEIR PATRIOTISM WAS STRONG THEIR PRIDE IN THE FLAG WAS OF THE OLD FASHIONED PATTERN THEIR LOVE OF COUNTRY AMOUNTED TO IDOLATRY
THEN MY LOVE WOULD BE A FREE ACT AND NOT IN ANY WAY A NECESSITY MARGARET BOLTON SMILED AT THIS NEW-FANGLED PHILOSOPHY
THAT'S THE WAY I BLOCK IT OUT SIR--AND IT'S AS CLEAR AS DAY--CLEAR AS THE ROSY-MORN WASHINGTON HAD HEARD LITTLE OF THIS
BALAAM 110.  THE FIRE PANIC 111.  RUTH ASSISTS IN DRESSING PHILIP'S ARM 112.  THE FIRST RECEPTION 113.  VANITY COLLAPSED 114.  THE ATTACHES OF THE ANTIQUES 115.  HON
THE BEST BRAND ROEDERER
BY THE WAY--NEW YORK DID YOU SAY
WHY THE WHOLE THING
THAT'S ALL RIGHT
BARRY DID NOT NEED ANY INOCULATION HE ALWAYS TALKED IN SIX FIGURES
AND GOD BLESS THE IRON COMPANY TOO BUT A SOMETHING FLITTED THROUGH HIS MIND AND HIS OPENED LIPS UTTERED NOTHING
HOW CHANGED WAS ALL THE PHILADELPHIA WORLD WHICH HAD HITHERTO STOOD FOR THE EXEMPLIFICATION OF HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY
THEY WERE RAINBOW-HUED
DOGS ESPECIALLY--HUNTING DOGS
WE LEARN THAT THE COMPANY HAVE PUT A NEW ENGINE ON THE SEVEN O'CLOCK TRAIN AND NEWLY UPHOLSTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM CAR THROUGHOUT
SELLERS AND HARRY TALKED TOGETHER BY THE HOUR AND BY THE DAY
WHEN WASHINGTON REACHED HOME HE RECOGNIZED AT ONCE HOW SERIOUS HIS FATHER'S CASE WAS
HOW FAR HE MUST GO IN HE BELIEVED HE KNEW BUT NO ONE COULD TELL EXACTLY
LAURA REMAINED IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AND LEFT THEM TO PILOT THEMSELVES OUT OF THE HOUSE--AN INHOSPITABLE THING IT SEEMED TO HER BUT THEN SHE WAS FOLLOWING HER INSTRUCTIONS
ONE DAY HE HAD AN OFFER FROM SOME COUNTRY FRIENDS WHO BELIEVED IN HIM TO TAKE CHARGE OF A PROVINCIAL DAILY NEWSPAPER AND HE WENT TO CONSULT MR GRINGO--GRINGO WHO YEARS AGO MANAGED THE ATLAS--ABOUT TAKING THE SITUATION
BUT SUIN'S NO USE
NO HE KEPT THIS TO HIMSELF AND PRAISED THE TURNIPS TO THE PERIL OF HIS SOUL
DID ANYBODY TELL YOU TO SAY YOU HAD NO OPINION ABOUT IT N--N--O SIR TAKE CARE NOW TAKE CARE
WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO INTO SOMETHING
A NIGGRO HAS NO GRASP SIR
TOURS DE FORCE ON THE PIANO AND FRAGMENTS FROM OPERAS WHICH HAVE NO MEANING WITHOUT THE SETTING WITH WEARY PAUSES OF WAITING BETWEEN
BLESS MY SOUL I'M SO ABSENT-MINDED WHEN I GET TO THINKING
THIS SOUNDS FINE AND BOLD AND INNOCENT
BYE AND BYE HE SAID
MRS HAWKINS WAS ALLOWED TO GO ON
HIS REVERIE CONTINUED AND ITS BURDEN GREW MORE AND MORE GLOOMY
I CONFESS THAT
SHE KNEW WHAT A LITTLE INCONVENIENCE MEANT BUT SHE KNEW THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT
P
P
P
P
P
P
EVERY ROOM HAD ITS BOOK-CASES OR BOOK-SHELVES AND WAS MORE OR LESS A LIBRARY
I CALL IT A SWINDLE ON THE STATE
THE FIRST FASHIONABLE CALL SHE RECEIVED FROM A MEMBER OF THE ANCIENT NOBILITY OTHERWISE THE ANTIQUES WAS OF A PATTERN WITH ALL SHE RECEIVED FROM THAT LIMB OF THE ARISTOCRACY AFTERWARD
OH COME DON'T BEHAVE SO
JEFF TOOK A LITTLE WRITING FROM THE COLONEL AND HARRY FOR A PROSPECTIVE SHARE BUT PHILIP DECLINED TO JOIN IN SAYING THAT HE HAD NO MONEY AND DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE ENGAGEMENTS HE COULDN'T FULFILL
AND B'GEORGE I'VE LEFT MY CHECK-BOOK TOO--POLLY SAYS I OUGHT TO HAVE A NURSE--WELL NO MATTER
WITH KILLING HIM WITH A SLUNG-SHOT A BLUDGEON CARVING KNIFE BOWIE KNIFE PEN KNIFE ROLLING PIN CAR HOOK DAGGER HAIR PIN WITH A HAMMER WITH A SCREW-DRIVER WITH A NAIL AND WITH ALL OTHER WEAPONS AND UTENSILS WHATSOEVER AT THE SOUTHERN HOTEL AND IN ALL OTHER HOTELS AND PLACES WHERESOEVER ON THE THIRTEENTH DAY OF MARCH AND ALL OTHER DAYS OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA WHERESOEVER
HOW AM I TO MOVE MY CROPS
SIXTY OR EIGHTY OR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE ARE BOUND TO GET IN WHO ARE NOT ANGELS IN DISGUISE AS YOUNG HICKS THE CORRESPONDENT SAYS
AND WAS IT ALL PRESENT
BUT WHENEVER HE INCLINED TO BE SENTIMENTAL RUTH WOULD CUT HIM OFF WITH SOME SUCH GRAVELY CONCEIVED SPEECH AS DOES THEE THINK THAT THY PHYSICIAN WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CONDITION OF A MAN WHO IS AS WEAK AS THEE IS
AND THE MYSTERY OF HER BIRTH AT ONCE CHAGRINED HER AND RAISED IN HER THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT EXPECTATIONS
WELCOME TO NAPOLEON GENTLEMEN WELCOME
BUT AS THE CURTAIN RISES ON THIS AWFUL TRAGEDY WE CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE SOCIETY AT THE CAPITAL UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION WHICH WE CANNOT CONTEMPLATE WITHOUT ALARM FOR THE FATE OF THE REPUBLIC
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS GOT INTO YOU TO-DAY
FELLOW CITIZENS
HE KISSED HER HAND AND HER LIPS
NEVER RECEIVED FROM THE TRAVELING PUBLIC ANY PATRONAGE EXCEPT FACETIOUS REMARKS UPON HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE
THE WEIGHTIEST OF FRIENDS FLOCKED TO ITS STANDARD
MY SOUL IS LOST IN WONDER AT THE THOUGHT
THE FRIENDS OF THE BILL WERE INSTRUCTED BY THE LEADERS TO MAKE NO EFFORT TO CHECK IT
LET THE MISGUIDED MAN STAY
BUT HOW WOULD IT STRIKE YOU IF I WERE TO SAY THAT I WAS IN WASHINGTON ALL THE TIME THIS BILL WAS PENDING
THEREUPON A YOUNG SPRIG FROM THE EAST BLUSTERED LIKE A SHANGHAI ROOSTER AND BEGAN TO SASS THE CONDUCTOR WITH HIS CHIN MUSIC
SHE WAS IN A TEMPEST OF EXCITEMENT

CHAPTER XIV
YOU STILL BEGIN TO SQUANDER A FORTUNE RIGHT AND LEFT THE INSTANT YOU HEAR OF IT IN THE DISTANCE
AND WHOEVER IT TOUCHES CAN MAKE HIS WILL AND CONTRACT FOR THE FUNERAL
HIS ROOMS WERE FULL OF DRY GOODS BOXES INTO WHICH HIS SERVANT WAS CROWDING ALL MANNER OF OLD CLOTHES AND STUFF
SHE KEPT HER MOTHER AND WASHINGTON FREELY SUPPLIED WITH MONEY AND DID THE SAME BY COL
A MOUNTAIN OF COAL
DILWORTHY ARGUED
PHILIP MANAGED TO COMPLETE HIS TOILET BY THE USE OF HIS POCKET-HANDKERCHIEF AND DECLINING THE HOSPITALITY OF THE LANDLORD IMPLIED IN THE REMARK YOU WON'D DAKE NOTIN HE WENT INTO THE OPEN AIR TO WAIT FOR BREAKFAST
BIGLER SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW
BUT OF COURSE IT'S CHEERFUL
WE'VE GOT TO DRAG ALONG DRAG ALONG AND EAT CRUSTS IN TOIL AND POVERTY ALL HOPELESS AND FORLORN--BUT THEY'LL RIDE IN COACHES NANCY
SHE FROWNED UPON NO LOVER WHEN HE MADE HIS FIRST ADVANCES BUT BY AND BY WHEN SHE WAS HOPELESSLY ENTHRALLED HE LEARNED FROM HER OWN LIPS THAT SHE HAD FORMED A RESOLUTION NEVER TO MARRY
WE'VE RAKED IN $200,000 OF UNCLE SAM'S MONEY SAY WHAT THEY WILL--AND THERE IS MORE WHERE THIS CAME FROM WHEN WE WANT IT AND I RATHER FANCY I AM THE PERSON THAT CAN GO IN AND OCCUPY IT TOO IF I DO SAY IT MYSELF THAT SHOULDN'T PERHAPS
I JUST PUT MY HEAD TO WORK PEGGED AWAY A COUPLE OF DAYS AND HERE YOU ARE
THE AUTUMN CAME AND FOUND PHILIP WORKING WITH DIMINISHED FORCE BUT STILL WITH HOPE
EVERYBODY IN THE COURT ROOM KNEW MR BRAHAM THE GREAT CRIMINAL LAWYER AND HE WAS NOT UNAWARE THAT HE WAS THE OBJECT OF ALL EYES AS HE MOVED TO HIS PLACE BOWING TO HIS FRIENDS IN THE BAR
MISTER......ER....BRIERLY
I WAS A BRUTE IN LEAVING YOU AS I DID
SUPPOSE YOU WERE A THIEF AND THAT TRUNK WAS LYING AROUND AND NOBODY WATCHING--WOULDN'T YOU STEAL IT
PRETTILY CONFUSED--"EMMELINE HOW CAN YOU MRS G.--"LET YOUR SISTER ALONE EMMELINE
AND IT EVEN CROSSED HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISSIONARY LIFE TO SOME BENIGHTED REGION WHERE THE DATE-PALM GROWS AND THE NIGHTINGALE'S VOICE IS IN TUNE AND THE BUL-BUL SINGS ON THE OFF NIGHTS
DEY WAS BURNT CONSIDABLE--OB COASE DEY WAS
THE HOUSE MUST DO ITS WORK OVER AGAIN OF COURSE BUT THE SAME MEMBERSHIP WAS THERE TO SEE THAT IT DID IT.--THE SENATE WAS SECURE--SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS ABLE TO PUT ALL DOUBTS TO REST ON THAT HEAD
OF HOW THESE GENTLEMEN SUCCUMBED ONE BY ONE TILL A MAJORITY WAS SECURED
HE BEGAN SOMEWHAT AS FOLLOWS
PRESENTLY HE STOPPED TOOK OUT HIS POCKET BOOK AND COUNTED HIS MONEY
HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO SORELY PRESSED
RUNNING WATER HOT AND COLD
HOW HER VOICE THRILLED HIM WHEN SHE FIRST SPOKE
IN THE COURT ROOM THE GENERAL FEELING WAS IN FAVOR OF LAURA BUT WHETHER THIS FEELING EXTENDED TO THE JURY THEIR STOLID FACES DID NOT REVEAL
THERE IS NO COAL HERE
IT IS FEARED THAT THE UNIVERSITY SWINDLE IS STRONGER TO-DAY THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN BEFORE LATER-MIDNIGHT
SUCH A WOMAN WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED HARRY AT ANY TIME BUT ONLY A WOMAN WITH A COOL BRAIN AND EXQUISITE ART COULD HAVE MADE HIM LOSE HIS HEAD IN THIS WAY
IN FACT IT COULD NOT BE
THE RAILROAD THAT WAS GOING TO BUILD UP HAWKEYE MADE SHORT WORK OF HIM ALONG WITH THE REST
I DOLD JAKE SCHMIDT HE FIND HIM DERE SHUST SO SURE AS NOTING YOU OUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN A SHARE MR DUSENHEIMER SAID PHILIP
THEN THEY ALL EXPECT THAT SORT OF A VERDICT WHEN IT COMES IN AND SO DID HE
FROSTS IN THE AUTUMN THE SAME AND RAINS IN SPRING NOT OBJECTIONABLE
I'LL GO WITH YOU--NOW THERE'S MY WORD ON IT
WHY ON HE COULDN'T QUITE SAY IT FOR IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS A POOR STICK FOR ANY BODY TO LEAN ON IN THE PRESENT STATE OF HIS FORTUNE AND THAT THE WOMAN BEFORE HIM WAS AT LEAST AS INDEPENDENT AS HE WAS
OTHERS AGAIN HAVE MADE THEIR PILE ON TAKING IT
MRS OLIVER HIGGINS WAS THE WIFE OF A DELEGATE FROM A DISTANT TERRITORY--A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD KEPT THE PRINCIPAL SALOON AND SOLD THE BEST WHISKEY IN THE PRINCIPAL VILLAGE IN HIS WILDERNESS AND SO OF COURSE WAS RECOGNIZED AS THE FIRST MAN OF HIS COMMONWEALTH AND ITS FITTEST REPRESENTATIVE
THERE ARE MEN I KNOW WOULD GIVE HER A RAILROAD OR AN OPERA HOUSE OR WHATEVER SHE WANTED--AT LEAST THEY'D PROMISE HARRY HAD A WAY OF LOOKING AT WOMEN AS HE LOOKED AT ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD HE WANTED AND HE HALF RESOLVED TO APPROPRIATE MISS LAURA DURING HIS STAY IN HAWKEYE
SAFE
UPON BEING PUSHED HE ADMITTED THAT SHE HAD AFTERWARDS CONFESSED THAT SHE SAW SELBY THERE
HE WAS NEARLY AS CLOSE TO THE STOVE AS HE COULD GET AND YET HE COULD NOT PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE FELT THE SLIGHTEST HEAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE ISINGLASS DOOR WAS STILL GENTLY AND SERENELY GLOWING
FROM THESE STORIES SHE LEARNED WHAT A WOMAN OF KEEN INTELLECT AND SOME CULTURE JOINED TO BEAUTY AND FASCINATION OF MANNER MIGHT EXPECT TO ACCOMPLISH IN SOCIETY AS SHE READ OF IT
IF THE THAW IS STILL GOING ON WHEN YOU COME DOWN AND GO ABOUT TOWN YOU WILL WONDER AT THE SHORT-SIGHTEDNESS OF THE CITY FATHERS WHEN YOU COME TO INSPECT THE STREETS IN THAT THEY DO NOT DILUTE THE MUD A LITTLE MORE AND USE THEM FOR CANALS
YOU ARE ABLE TO HELP A MEASURE ALONG IN MANY WAYS IF YOU CHOOSE
VERY VERY EXPENSIVE THING TAKE IT ALL AROUND IS A BIG INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT CONCERN--BUT YOU SEE THAT YOURSELF MR BRYERMAN--YOU SEE THAT YOURSELF SIR BUT LOOK HERE
PHILIP HAD ANOTHER IDEA WHICH HE DID NOT MENTION
PERHAPS HE LOVED HER A LITTLE AFTER ALL
PHILIP THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD GO SOME DAY AND EXTRICATE RUTH BUT HE DID NOT WRITE THAT FOR HE HAD THE INSTINCT TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS NOT THE EXTRICATION SHE DREAMED OF AND THAT SHE MUST FIND OUT BY HER OWN EXPERIENCE WHAT HER HEART REALLY WANTED
HAWKEYE HAD ALWAYS DECLINED TO SUBSCRIBE ANYTHING TOWARD THE RAILWAY IMAGINING THAT HER LARGE BUSINESS WOULD BE A SUFFICIENT COMPULSORY INFLUENCE
THE POOR WOMAN'S FACE WAS CRIMSON AND THE TEARS STOOD IN HER EYES
MUM'S THE WORD
WHAT'S THE ROAD OUT ANOTHER APPROPRIATION DON'T YOU SEE BOTHER THE APPROPRIATIONS
ILIUM WAS IN A NARROW MOUNTAIN GORGE THROUGH WHICH A RAPID STREAM RAN
NOT GUILTY A SHOUT WENT UP FROM THE ENTIRE ROOM AND A TUMULT OF CHEERING WHICH THE COURT IN VAIN ATTEMPTED TO QUELL
THAT DAY MR BOLTON BROUGHT HOME A STRANGER TO DINNER MR BIGLER OF THE GREAT FIRM OF PENNYBACKER BIGLER SMALL RAILROAD CONTRACTORS
ON THE EVIDENCE THE JURY MUST CONVICT AND MIGHT DO SO WITHOUT LEAVING THEIR SEATS
BUT IT DID COST A DEAL TO BUY THE OLD NUMSKULL OUT--AND THEN WHEN THEY PUT THE NEW COG WHEEL IN THEY'D OVERLOOKED SOMETHING SOMEWHERE AND IT WASN'T ANY USE--THE TROUBLESOME THING WOULDN'T GO
SCHAICK IS GOING TO LET ME HAVE TEN THOUSAND JUST FOR A FLYER IN SUCH OPERATIONS BUT THAT'S A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY WAIT TILL YOU ARE USED TO HANDLING MONEY
I WAS KNOWING TO THESE LETTERS WHEN JUDGE HAWKINS RECEIVED THEM
THEY PREFER EM MOSTLY THE PETITION HOWEVER WAS ELABORATELY DRAWN UP WITH A GLOWING DESCRIPTION OF NAPOLEON AND THE ADJACENT COUNTRY AND A STATEMENT OF THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY TO THE PROSPERITY OF THAT REGION AND OF ONE OF THE STATIONS ON THE GREAT THROUGH ROUTE TO THE PACIFIC OF THE IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT OF COLUMBUS RIVER
THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE'S FULL OF MONEY
MR DILWORTHY URGED HIM TO VOTE FOR HIM
THEY LEARNED THEN THAT THE STAGECOACH IS BUT A POOR PLODDING VULGAR THING IN THE SOLITUDES OF THE HIGHWAY
HE INQUIRED INTO CLAY'S AFFAIRS AND PROSPECTS AND WHEN HE FOUND THAT CLAY WAS DOING PRETTY WELL AND WAS LIKELY TO DO STILL BETTER IT WAS PLAIN THAT HE RESIGNED HIMSELF WITH EASY FACILITY TO LOOK TO THE SON FOR A SUPPORT
THE COACHMEN AND FOOTMEN WERE CLAD IN BRIGHT NEW LIVERY OF STRIKING COLORS AND THEY HAD BLACK ROSETTES WITH SHAVING-BRUSHES PROJECTING ABOVE THEM ON THE SIDES OF THEIR STOVE-PIPE HATS
YES IT WAS A MERRY EVENING AND PHILIP WAS HEARTILY GLAD WHEN IT WAS OVER AND THE LONG LEAVE-TAKING WITH THE FAMILY WAS THROUGH WITH
CALLERS WHO WENT AWAY SAID SHE HAD BEEN TOO GAY--THEY DID NOT SAY FAST THOUGH SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE THOUGHT IT
YOU MIGHT BETTER HAVE KILLED ME THEN
WHAT'S THE GOOD FATHER OF A SERIES OF HUMAN BEINGS WHO DON'T ADVANCE ANY FRIEND ELI WHO HAD LONG AGO LAID ASIDE THE QUAKER DRESS AND WAS OUT OF MEETING AND WHO IN FACT AFTER A YOUTH OF DOUBT COULD NOT YET DEFINE HIS BELIEF NEVERTHELESS LOOKED WITH SOME WONDER AT THIS FIERCE YOUNG EAGLE OF HIS HATCHED IN A FRIEND'S DOVE-COTE
FROM THE CENTRE OF OUR COUNTRY TO ITS CIRCUMFERENCE NOTHING WAS TALKED OF BUT MR NOBLE'S TERRIBLE REVELATION AND THE PEOPLE WERE FURIOUS
WASHINGTON VERY STIFF AND TIRED AND HUNGRY CLIMBED OUT AND WONDERED HOW HE WAS TO PROCEED NOW
BUT YOU MUSTN'T DO IT WITHOUT CONSULTING ALICE
LET'S SEE
THERE WAS AN ASH-HOPPER BY THE FENCE AND AN IRON POT FOR SOFT-SOAP-BOILING NEAR IT
I PLEDGE MY HONOR AS A SENATOR THAT I HAVE SPOKEN BUT THE TRUTH
THAT IS LIKE THE DUCHESS SAID HE
IT WAS TO THEM SHE SAID HE BROUGHT IT ON HIMSELF COL
FOREMEN AND LABORERS FROM NEIGHBORING MINES AND NO END OF EXPERIENCED LOAFERS FROM THE VILLAGE VISITED THE TUNNEL FROM TIME TO TIME AND THEIR VERDICTS WERE ALWAYS THE SAME AND ALWAYS DISHEARTENING--"NO COAL IN THAT HILL NOW AND THEN PHILIP WOULD SIT DOWN AND THINK IT ALL OVER AND WONDER WHAT THE MYSTERY MEANT
BUT I HAVE PERFORMED MY DUTY AND WILL TAKE PLEASURE IN TELLING THEM WHAT YOU SAY HE WAS ABOUT TO RISE
HE WAS GAY OR GRAVE AS THE NEED MIGHT BE
IF THE REPORT WERE ACCEPTED HE WOULD GO FORTH FREE AND SCATHLESS GLORYING IN HIS CRIME AND IT WOULD BE A TACIT ADMISSION THAT ANY BLACKGUARD COULD INSULT THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND CONSPIRE AGAINST THE SACRED REPUTATION OF ITS MEMBERS WITH IMPUNITY
THE BIRDS WERE SINGING THE BLOSSOMS OF PEACH TREES IN CITY GARDEN PLOTS MADE THE AIR SWEET AND IN THE ROAR AND TUMULT ON THE LONG RIVER LEVEE THEY FOUND AN EXCITEMENT THAT ACCORDED WITH THEIR OWN HOPEFUL ANTICIPATIONS
BUT NO MAN COULD LONG CONSIDER HIS OWN TROUBLES IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH SUFFERING AS WASHINGTON'S
THIS WAS ALL
IT WAS A WINTRY ONE
WHAT SHOULD YOU SAY SIR TO A CITY BUILT UP LIKE THE ROD OF ALADDIN HAD TOUCHED IT BUILT UP IN TWO YEARS WHERE NOW YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT IT ANY MORE THAN YOU'D EXPECT A LIGHT-HOUSE ON THE TOP OF PILOT KNOB
SELLERS--WHO ALWAYS INSISTED UPON GIVING HIS NOTE FOR LOANS--WITH INTEREST
WHAT IT IS TO BE ACCLIMATED TO WESTERN FEVERS NO TWO PERSONS EXACTLY AGREE
THAT SHE WAS VERY RICH AND A GREAT LANDED HEIRESS
PHIL WANTED HIM PHIL HAD A GREAT THING ON HAND UP IN PENNSYLVANIA
HIS INCREASED PECUNIARY OBLIGATION OPPRESSED HIM
APPARENTLY IT WAS NOT THERE
WHAT HAS STARTED THIS SUDDEN EXCITEMENT ABOUT IRON
NO CONCERN CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT MONEY
HAVING NOW ACQUIRED A HAPPY SMATTERING OF VARIOUS INFORMATION SHE USED IT WITH GOOD EFFECT--SHE PASSED FOR A SINGULARLY WELL INFORMED WOMAN IN WASHINGTON
AH--I SEE WITH A BRIGHT SMILE]--"TRAIN YOU MEAN--NOT TAINE
SHE SAID SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO REACH THE SOUTHERN HOTEL WHERE MR SIMONS ONE OF THE ABSENT MEMBERS WAS STAYING BEFORE HE WENT OUT
THERE--THERE--LET ME PUT MY HAND IN BENEDICTION ON THIS PRECIOUS HEAD
SELLERS MISS ALICE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF HARRY'S WHO IS ALWAYS TRYING TO BUILD A HOUSE BY BEGINNING AT THE TOP I SUPPOSE IT'S AS EASY TO BUILD A UNIVERSITY ON PAPER AS A SEMINARY AND IT LOOKS BETTER WAS HARRY'S REFLECTION
DIDN'T HE BUY AFTER ALL
WHAT DID MY CONSCIOUSNESS REPLY
A LARGER NUMBER OF STATESMEN ARE TO VOTE AND WORK FOR THE BILL--ALSO OUT OF LOVE FOR THE NEGRO--GENTLEMEN OF BUT MODERATE INFLUENCE THESE--AND OUT OF PURE GENEROSITY I AM TO SEE THAT RELATIVES OF THEIRS HAVE POSITIONS IN THE UNIVERSITY WITH SALARIES AND GOOD ONES TOO
YOU'RE A MILLIONAIRE
OF THE MURDER THERE COULD NOT BE THE LEAST DOUBT OR THAT THE PRISONER FOLLOWED THE DECEASED TO NEW YORK WITH A MURDEROUS INTENT
THE COLONEL WAS TOUCHED
SECOND THE MOTION
AND NOBODY COULD DO ENOUGH FOR ME AND WHATEVER I SAID WAS WONDERFUL SIR IT WAS ALWAYS WONDERFUL
WELL I NEVER HEARD ANYBODY EXPRESS AN IDEA LIKE THAT BEFORE
OR LAURA NOT FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
SOME HAD A LOOK OF ANIMAL CUNNING WHILE THE MOST WERE ONLY STUPID
A FELLOW MIGHT AS WELL MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION AS A POOR ONE NONSENSE
YOU ARE RIGHT
WHOEVER DRAGGED THE NATIONAL HONOR IN THE DIRT WON THEIR DEATHLESS HATRED
ALL WENT WELL
BUT AS HE GOT COOLER THAT DID NOT SEEM TO HIM A PROJECT WORTHY OF A GENTLEMAN EXACTLY
IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO HIM THE MOST PEACEFUL RELIGION
MRS A
DID YOU EVER SEE A HOUSE AFIRE
HE COULDN'T REALIZE THAT HE HAD FALLEN HOPELESSLY IN LOVE WITHOUT SOME RIGHTS ACCRUING TO HIM FOR THE POSSESSION OF THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION
FOR WHAT WOULD THERE HAVE BEEN TO CONQUER
BUT YOU KNOW THAT I WOULDN'T TOUCH THIS BILL IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD AND FOR THE GOOD OF THE COLORED RACE
IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROBLEM AND HAS BEEN A GOOD DEAL DISCUSSED AND ITS SOLUTION WOULD FORM ONE FIXED PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS UPON WHICH TO ESTIMATE WOMAN'S CHARACTER
THIS GENTLEMEN SAID JEFF IS COLUMBUS RIVER ALIAS GOOSE RUN
BE PATIENT
THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE PEOPLE FROM THE ATLANTIC STATES
THAT THE WATER WAS POOR
THE MAN THAT WILL VOTE FOR THAT BILL WILL BREAK THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT IN ANY OTHER WAY SIR BUT HE WILL NOT VOTE FOR YOUR CORRUPT MEASURE NEVERTHELESS MADAM EXCLAIMED MR TROLLOP RISING FROM HIS SEAT IN A PASSION
SHE SAW COL
THAT SETTLED THE MATTER
WHY WOMAN DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT MAN DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT
SHE MADE AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH FOR THE MISSING LETTERS BUT FOUND NONE
A PERSON WHO HAD MET THE WOMAN ON THE STAIRS FELT A CREEPING SENSATION
BY THE WAY YOU NEVER GOT TO DINE WITH ME AND THE COLONEL STRODE AWAY TO THE WAGON AND LOOKED UNDER THE SEAT FOR THE BASKET
I AM NOT SO BLIND BUT I CAN SEE THAT
MR TROLLOP SAID
THE MINING CAMP WAS A BUSY PLACE AT ANY RATE
ON THIS DAY ALSO THE RE-ELECTION OF MR DILWORTHY TO THE SENATE WOULD TAKE PLACE
THE GALLERIES OF THE HOUSE WERE PACKED ON THE MOMENTOUS DAY NOT BECAUSE THE REPORTING OF AN IMPORTANT BILL BACK BY A COMMITTEE WAS A THING TO BE EXCITED ABOUT IF THE BILL WERE GOING TO TAKE THE ORDINARY COURSE AFTERWARD
PHILIP WAS RUNNING A TUNNEL INTO THE BREAST OF THE MOUNTAIN IN FAITH THAT THE COAL STRATUM RAN THERE AS IT OUGHT TO
THE ROOM ITSELF WAS FAMILIAR ENOUGH BUT NIGHT MAKES ALMOST ANY CHAMBER EERIE AND ESPECIALLY SUCH A ROOM OF DETENTION AS THIS WHERE THE MORTAL PARTS OF THE UNBURIED MIGHT--ALMOST BE SUPPOSED TO BE VISITED ON THE SIGHING NIGHT WINDS BY THE WANDERING SPIRITS OF THEIR LATE TENANTS
YOU MUST PARDON ME FOR I WAS NOT THINKING.--AND YOU MUST LET ME THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HELPING ME
FOR AN INSTANT THE COLONEL LOOKED NONPLUSSED AND JUST A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE
THE FELLOW WAS IN FACT CRAZY ABOUT HER BEAUTY AND READY TO BEAT HIS BRAINS OUT IN CHAGRIN
WASHINGTON STOLE A GLANCE AT MRS SELLERS'S FACE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE WORLD THE NEXT MOMENT IF HE COULD HAVE SPARED HER THAT
IN THE METROPOLIS OF THE WESTERN WORLD
HER FATHER ENJOYED THE SOCIETY OF HIS FAVORITE DAUGHTER AS HE DID FEW THINGS BESIDES
THIS IS A DEEP MAN
HE WAS TO HER A MAN OF ANOTHER SOCIETY AND ANOTHER CULTURE DIFFERENT FROM THAT SHE HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE OF EXCEPT IN BOOKS AND SHE WAS NOT UNWILLING TO TRY ON HIM THE FASCINATIONS OF HER MIND AND PERSON
BUT YOU'D BETTER BEGIN BY ASKING ONLY FOR TWO OR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE USUAL WAY
A HUGE SHAPE DEVELOPED ITSELF OUT OF THE GLOOM AND FROM ITS TALL DUPLICATE HORNS DENSE VOLUMES OF SMOKE STARRED AND SPANGLED WITH SPARKS POURED OUT AND WENT TUMBLING AWAY INTO THE FARTHER DARKNESS
COLUMBUS RIVER
THE APPROPRIATION WHICH HE HAD ENGINEERED THROUGH CONGRESS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE INDIANS IN HIS TERRITORY WOULD HAVE MADE ALL THOSE SAVAGES RICH IF IT HAD EVER GOT TO THEM
PHILIP STERLING WAS ON HIS WAY TO ILIUM IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA
I TRUSTED TO THE WOMEN FOLKS TO SET THAT BASKET IN THE WAGON AND IT AIN'T THERE THE CAMP COOK SPEEDILY PREPARED A SAVORY BREAKFAST FOR THE COLONEL BROILED CHICKEN EGGS CORN-BREAD AND COFFEE TO WHICH HE DID AMPLE JUSTICE AND TOPPED OFF WITH A DROP OF OLD BOURBON FROM MR THOMPSON'S PRIVATE STORE A BRAND WHICH HE SAID HE KNEW WELL HE SHOULD THINK IT CAME FROM HIS OWN SIDEBOARD
SEVERAL OF YOU GENTLEMEN BOUGHT OF THAT STACK WITHOUT PAYING A PENNY DOWN RECEIVED DIVIDENDS FROM IT THINK OF THE HAPPY IDEA OF RECEIVING DIVIDENDS AND VERY LARGE ONES TOO FROM STOCK ONE HASN'T PAID FOR AND ALL THE WHILE YOUR NAMES NEVER APPEARED IN THE TRANSACTION
YOU MUST CONVINCE HIM THAT IF ANYTHING IMPROPER HAS BEEN DONE YOU AT LEAST ARE IGNORANT OF IT AND SORRY FOR IT
YOU CANNOT TAKE PLEASURE IN ADDING TO MY DISTRESS
THERE WERE PLANTS IN THE SUNNY WINDOWS AND SOME CHOICE ENGRAVINGS ON THE WALLS WITH BITS OF COLOR IN OIL OR WATER-COLORS
THAT WILL TAKE FOUR WEEKS YES THAT'S LIKE LAST YEAR
BE WARY
BE WARY
ELDERLY PEOPLE DIRECTED EACH OTHER'S ATTENTION AND SAID THERE
THAT'S HIM WITH THE GRAND NOBLE FOREHEAD BOYS NUDGED EACH OTHER AND SAID HI JOHNNY HERE HE IS THERE THAT'S HIM WITH THE PEELED HEAD THE SENATOR TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE PULPIT WITH THE MINISTER ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL ON THE OTHER
THE BOLTON HOUSE WAS A SORT OF HOTEL FOR THIS KIND OF PEOPLE
MEN WHOSE DEVOTION HAD SURVIVED EVEN THE GRISLY REVEALMENTS OF HER CHARACTER WHICH THE COURTS HAD UNCURTAINED
BALAAM'A GOT THE INJUN TO HIMSELF AND I SUPPOSE THAT SENATOR DILWORTHY FEELS THAT THERE IS NOTHING LEFT HIM BUT THE COLORED MAN
PHILIP HASTENED AT ONCE TO THE SOUTHERN HOTEL WHERE HE FOUND STILL A GREAT STATE OF EXCITEMENT AND A THOUSAND DIFFERENT AND EXAGGERATED STORIES PASSING FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH
FEW LANDS ARE SO BLEST THAT IS TRUE COLONEL
I BELIEVE I'LL DO IT.--A MAN WILL JUST ROT HERE
SPREAD HER WIDE OPEN
THERE WAS NO MORE TROUBLE
SHE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE A NEW PLAN
DECEMBER 18 FOUND WASHINGTON HAWKINS AND COL
DON'T DESERT US
YOU WOULDN'T DECEIVE ME HARRY THROWING INTO HER EYES A LOOK OF TRUST AND TENDERNESS THAT MELTED AWAY ALL HIS PETULANCE AND DISTRUST
THERE'S BEEN AS GOOD FISH IN THE SEA AS THERE ARE NOW
THE NEW DAY GREW TOWARD ITS PRIME AND STILL THE FORLORN PRESENCE WAS UNDISTURBED
COME NOW HOW DO THEY PROCEED WHY THEY PROCEED RIGHT AND REGULAR--AND IT AIN'T BOSH WASHINGTON IT AIN'T BOSH
A CORNER OF IT TOUCHED THE RAILROAD BUT THE REST WAS PRETTY MUCH AN UNBROKEN WILDERNESS EIGHT OR TEN THOUSAND ACRES OF ROUGH COUNTRY MOST OF IT SUCH A MOUNTAIN RANGE AS HE SAW AT ILIUM
IT CAME OFFICIALLY THROUGH BROTHER WASHINGTON THE PRIVATE SECRETARY WHO APPENDED A POSTSCRIPT THAT WAS BRIMMING WITH DELIGHT OVER THE PROSPECT OF SEEING THE DUCHESS AGAIN
SHE'S JUST SUPERB THAT LITTLE WOMAN
HE IS HIS COUNTRY'S CHILD LET HIS COUNTRY SUPPORT HIM
THE FRIENDS GREW IMPATIENT NOW
HE KNEW ALL THE SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES AND ESPECIALLY THE LOBBY
THE COUNTRY IS OPENING UP ALL WE WANT IS CAPITAL TO DEVELOP IT
THERE'S HOPE YET THAT NONSENSE UNCLE
DON'T LET EM INTO THE THING MORE THAN IS NECESSARY SAYS THE COLONEL TO HARRY
HE SWABBED IT OUT AND POURED IN THE POWDER AND INSERTED THE FUSE
ONE SENATOR INDEED SEVERAL SENATORS--OBJECTED THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD FAILED OF ITS DUTY
HE POINTED OUT WHERE THE CUNARDERS LAY WHEN IN PORT
BLESS MY LIFE WHAT LAWYERS THEY HAVE IN NEW-YORK
THE SUGGESTION FOUND A RESPONSE IN WASHINGTON'S BREAST AND THE SENATOR SAW THE SIGN OF IT IN HIS FACE
AND HE DID NOT DOUBT THAT THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY OF THAT KIND
AS IT DREW NEAR THE WAGON WAS SEEN TO CONTAIN A PORTLY GENTLEMAN WHO HITCHED IMPATIENTLY FORWARD ON HIS SEAT SHOOK THE REINS AND GENTLY TOUCHED UP HIS HORSE IN THE VAIN ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE HIS OWN ENERGY TO THAT DULL BEAST AND LOOKED EAGERLY AT THE TENTS
SIT DOWN AGAIN AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHY
THE WITNESSES OF THE EVENT HAD TOLD IT OVER SO MANY TIMES THAT THEY HAD WORKED IT UP INTO A MOST DRAMATIC SCENE AND EMBELLISHED IT WITH WHATEVER COULD HEIGHTEN ITS AWFULNESS
SHE MOVED TOWARD THE TABLE WITH ALL THE OLD DIGNITY IN HER CARRIAGE AND ALL THE OLD PRIDE IN HER MIEN
WHAT IS YOUR OCCUPATION CIVIL ENGINEER SIR AH CIVIL ENGINEER WITH A GLANCE AT THE JURY FOLLOWING THAT OCCUPATION WITH MISS HAWKINS SMILES BY THE JURY NO SIR SAID HARRY REDDENING
STREETS APPEARED
HAVE YOU FORMED OR EXPRESSED ANY OPINION ON THIS CASE AND DO YOU KNOW ANY OF THE PARTIES NOT ANY SAID MR LANIGAN
HE DOESN'T SEE HIS CHANCES
TO HIS UNCLE HE SAID THAT HE HAD MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH SOME NEW YORK CAPITALISTS TO GO TO MISSOURI IN A LAND AND RAILROAD OPERATION WHICH WOULD AT LEAST GIVE HIM A KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD AND NOT UNLIKELY OFFER HIM A BUSINESS OPENING
THEN WHERE AM I
WOULD MANAGE TO POSTPONE ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD UNLESS IT MIGHT BE THE MILLENNIUM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MR BUCKSTONE RESOLVED THAT NOW THAT THE NAIL WAS DRIVEN HOME HE WOULD CLINCH IT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND MAKE IT STAY FOREVER
PETITIONS ARE REFERRED SOMEWHERE AND THAT'S THE LAST OF THEM
SHE GLANCED UP THE STREET AND SURE ENOUGH PART 5
UNDER DATE OF SATURDAY
I WOULDN'T TAKE A HALF A MILLION JUST FOR MY SHARE
I KNOW THEY WERE FROM YOUR STATE BECAUSE I REMEMBER AFTERWARD MY OLD FRIEND GOVERNOR SHACKLEBY SAID TO ME--FINE MAN IS THE GOVERNOR--ONE OF THE FINEST MEN OUR COUNTRY HAS PRODUCED--SAID HE COLONEL HOW DID YOU LIKE THOSE NEW YORK GENTLEMEN?--NOT MANY SUCH MEN IN THE WORLD,--COLONEL SELLERS SAID THE GOVERNOR--YES IT WAS NEW YORK HE SAID--I REMEMBER IT DISTINCTLY
THE CHUTE SEEMED TO COME TO AN END EVERY FIFTY YARDS BUT ALWAYS OPENED OUT IN TIME
THERE WILL NEVER BE A WOMAN IN WASHINGTON THAT CAN COMPARE WITH YOU
SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL VERY MUCH AT HOME WITH THE TOWN ITSELF AND SHE WAS ALSO FAST ACQUIRING EASE WITH THE DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE SHE MET AT THE DILWORTHY TABLE AND LOSING WHAT LITTLE OF COUNTRY TIMIDITY SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER FROM HAWKEYE
AND THE CLINK OF GLASSES AND OF BILLIARD BALLS WAS IN THE AIR
CLIMB AND CLIMB AND CLIMB--AND WIND UP ON THE SUPREME BENCH
HER COOLNESS AND COYNESS WERE EVEN MADE TO APPEAR THE SIMPLE PRECAUTIONS OF A MODEST TIMIDITY AND ATTRACTED HIM EVEN MORE THAN THE LITTLE TENDERNESSES INTO WHICH SHE WAS OCCASIONALLY SURPRISED
HE VERY SOON KNEW EVERYBODY FROM THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE DOWN TO THE WAITERS AT THE HOTEL
YOU KNOW THAT BLACK STUFF THAT CROPS OUT OF THE BANK OF THE BRANCH?--WELL THAT'S IT
YOU UNDERSTAND THE CAPITOL STANDS UPON THE VERGE OF A HIGH PIECE OF TABLE LAND A FINE COMMANDING POSITION AND ITS FRONT LOOKS OUT OVER THIS NOBLE SITUATION FOR A CITY--BUT IT DON'T SEE IT FOR THE REASON THAT WHEN THE CAPITOL EXTENSION WAS DECIDED UPON THE PROPERTY OWNERS AT ONCE ADVANCED THEIR PRICES TO SUCH INHUMAN FIGURES THAT THE PEOPLE WENT DOWN AND BUILT THE CITY IN THE MUDDY LOW MARSH BEHIND THE TEMPLE OF LIBERTY
VIGOROUS PERSECUTION WILL ALONE CARRY A BILL SOMETIMES DEAR
CAN'T TRUST ANY COFFEE I DON'T IMPORT MYSELF
AT LAST THE SUPREME MOMENT CAME AND WITH HEAD ERECT AND THE BEARING OF AN EMPRESS SHE SWEPT THROUGH THE DOOR AND STOOD UPON THE STAGE
IT IS MRS HAWKINS THIS GOOD LADY WHO IS STILL HER LOVING FRIEND
HAWKINS TOOK A WEEKLY PHILADELPHIA NEWSPAPER AND A SEMI-WEEKLY ST LOUIS JOURNAL--ALMOST THE ONLY PAPERS THAT CAME TO THE VILLAGE THOUGH GODEY'S LADY'S BOOK FOUND A GOOD MARKET THERE AND WAS REGARDED AS THE PERFECTION OF POLITE LITERATURE BY SOME OF THE ABLEST CRITICS IN THE PLACE
FOR THOUGH PHILIP WROTE LONG LETTERS HE GOT BRIEF ONES IN REPLY FULL OF SHARP LITTLE OBSERVATIONS HOWEVER SUCH AS ONE CONCERNING COL
TOGETHER THEY PLANTED ROSES BY THE HEADBOARD AND STREWED WILD FLOWERS UPON THE GRAVE
TWO OR THREE PURCHASERS PUT UP FRAME HOUSES AT THE LANDING AND MOVED IN AND OF COURSE A FAR-SIGHTED BUT EASY-GOING JOURNEYMAN PRINTER WANDERED ALONG AND STARTED THE NAPOLEON WEEKLY TELEGRAPH AND LITERARY REPOSITORY"--A PAPER WITH A LATIN MOTTO FROM THE UNABRIDGED DICTIONARY AND PLENTY OF FAT CONVERSATIONAL TALES AND DOUBLE-LEADED POETRY--ALL FOR TWO DOLLARS A YEAR STRICTLY IN ADVANCE
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU VIEWED THE MATTER DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER PEOPLE
I MYSELF GO TO THE PLANTER'S OLD ARISTOCRATIC HOUSE
CURIOUS GIRL ANYWAY
VICTORY WAS ALMOST IN SIGHT NOW AND THE FRIENDS OF THE BILL THREW THEMSELVES INTO THEIR WORK WITH ENTHUSIASM
THE THING GOES ALONG SMOOTHLY NOW
THAT ON THE
THEY WERE CITIZENS HUSBANDS PERHAPS FATHERS
HE'D INTRODUCE YOU TO WASHINGTON LIFE QUICK ENOUGH
DEM BOYS GEEPS ME UP ZO SPATE
THE HORRIBLE SPECTACLE OF A GIBBET
WITH ME THERE THERE CHILD
WELL THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE IS A GOOD DEAL A MATTER OF SYMPATHY
THE SCHOOL STIFLED ME IT'S A PLACE TO TURN YOUNG PEOPLE INTO DRIED FRUIT I KNOW SAID MARGARET BOLTON WITH A HALF ANXIOUS SMILE THEE CHAFES AGAINST ALL THE WAYS OF FRIENDS BUT WHAT WILL THEE DO
THE WINDOW SHUTTERS WERE NOT BOWED
SENATOR DILWORTHY SAID TO WASHINGTON THAT AN HUMBLE DEPORTMENT UNDER PUNISHMENT WAS BEST AND THAT THERE WAS BUT ONE WAY IN WHICH THE TROUBLED HEART MIGHT FIND PERFECT REPOSE AND PEACE
AND TELL HIM THE IDEA IS MINE--I'M NO MORE CONCEITED THAN MOST PEOPLE I RECKON BUT YOU KNOW IT IS HUMAN NATURE FOR A MAN TO WANT CREDIT FOR A THING LIKE THAT WASHINGTON SAID WITH HIS BLUE LIPS THAT HE WOULD BUT HE SAID IN HIS SECRET HEART THAT HE WOULD PROMOTE NO SUCH INIQUITY
I WOULD GO ANYWHERE ANYWHERE IN THE WIDE WORLD WITH YOU
DARLING YOU MUST SAID PHILIP IN A TONE OF FAITH AND COURAGE THAT CARRIED A THRILL OF DETERMINATION--OF COMMAND--ALONG ALL HER NERVES
DID YOU EVER SEE THAT NOW DON'T BE CROSS PHIL
CONGRESS IS VINDICTIVE CONGRESS IS SAVAGE SIR WHEN IT GETS WAKED UP ONCE
THEY REVILED HER WITHOUT STINT
YOUR FACE IS AS WHITE AS PAPER IT'S HE IT'S HE
ALMOST AS BAD AS SELLING ONE'S VOTE FOR--BUT I FORGET
RE-DIRECT EXAMINATION
SHALL WE WALK AND THE THREE STROLLED ALONG THE STREETS THE COLONEL TALKING ALL THE WAY IN THE MOST LIBERAL AND FRIENDLY MANNER AND WITH A FRANK OPEN-HEARTEDNESS THAT INSPIRED CONFIDENCE
PATRIQUE OREILLE AND FAMILY AND SO ARE KNOWN UNTO THIS DAY
READ-FIRST-AND-SECOND-TIME-CONSIDERED-IN-COMMITTEE-OF-THE-WHOLE-ORDERED-ENGROSSED AND-PASSED-TO-THIRD-READING-AND-FINAL PASSAGE THE PRESIDENT--"THIRD READING OF THE BILL THE TWO FRIENDS SHOOK IN THEIR SHOES
TROLLOP'S ESPOUSAL OF OUR CAUSE HAS IMMENSELY HELPED US AND WE GROW IN POWER CONSTANTLY
SOME SCRIBBLED AIMLESSLY
THE FIRST MAN CALLED WAS MICHAEL LANIGAN SALOON KEEPER
SOMETIMES SHE APPROACHED A SOLID WALL OF TALL TREES AS IF SHE MEANT TO BREAK THROUGH IT BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN A LITTLE CRACK WOULD OPEN JUST ENOUGH TO ADMIT HER AND AWAY SHE WOULD GO PLOWING THROUGH THE CHUTE WITH JUST BARELY ROOM ENOUGH BETWEEN THE ISLAND ON ONE SIDE AND THE MAIN LAND ON THE OTHER
I AM YOUR MOTHER IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND NOTHING SHALL EVER TAKE YOU FROM ME ALL BARRIERS FELL BEFORE THIS APPEAL
SOME PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT RATHER OBTRUSIVE PERHAPS BUT I DON'T--I THINK IT IS REAL KINDNESS--EVEN CHARITY
CHAPTER XLI
IN FACT IT WAS OPENLY SAID THAT THERE WAS NO MONEY IN THE ELECTION
RUTH NEVER EMBROIDERED AND NEVER SEWED WHEN SHE COULD AVOID IT
COME WHAT IS THE MATTER
SENATOR DILWORTHY WHO WAS FROM A NEIGHBORING STATE HAD BEEN A UNIONIST IN THE DARKEST DAYS OF HIS COUNTRY AND HAD THRIVEN BY IT BUT WAS THAT ANY REASON WHY COL
THAT WOMAN DOESN'T KNOW WHAT FEAR IS HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND SHE WATCHES ME LIKE A HAWK HE TOLD HIS WIFE THAT THIS WOMAN WAS A LOBBYIST WHOM HE HAD TO TOLERATE AND USE IN GETTING THROUGH HIS CLAIMS AND THAT HE SHOULD PAY HER AND HAVE DONE WITH HER WHEN HE SUCCEEDED
BESIDES I CAN PUT THIS MONEY INTO OPERATIONS HERE THAT WILL INCREASE IT A HUNDRED FOLD YES A THOUSAND FOLD IN A FEW MONTHS
THEY ARE A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT YOU'LL LEARN IN THIS CLIMATE THAT YOU'D BETTER NOT ECONOMIZE ON POOR CIGARS HAVING IMPARTED THIS VALUABLE PIECE OF INFORMATION THE COLONEL LIGHTED THE FRAGRANT CIGAR WITH SATISFACTION AND THEN CARELESSLY PUT HIS FINGERS INTO HIS RIGHT VEST POCKET
BUT HE CONTENDED WITH AN ALERT AND SUSPICIOUS ENEMY
WASN'T SHE FATHER
YET LAURA WAS NOT WITHOUT FRIENDS AND SOME OF THEM VERY INFLUENTIAL TOO
FROM WHAT I CAN HEAR--NOT FROM HIM OF COURSE BUT FROM OTHERS--HE IS NOT FAR FROM AS BAD OFF AS WE ARE--AND HIS FAMILY IS AS LARGE TOO
THEE WROTE THAT PHILIP STERLING WAS AT FALLKILL YES AND HENRY BRIERLY A FRIEND OF HIS
AND YOU'VE BEEN HERE A WEEK GRACE AND DON'T KNOW
HE DIDN'T FANCY PHILIP'S BANTER AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD GONE OUT AND RUTH ASKED WHY DON'T YOU TAKE UP MEDICINE MR BRIERLY HARRY SAID I HAVE IT IN MIND
I WISH WE HAD ONE MORE GOOD STRONG MAN
JUST WAIT AND BE PATIENT BUT IS IT GOING TO BE AS MUCH AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS WHAT DO THEY SAY IT IS OH EVER SO MUCH
GRANT'S GOT THE IDEA
SAID HE
PHILIP USED SOMETIMES TO DECLARE THAT SHE HAD NO SENTIMENT
LOOK AT THAT NOW
NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN THIS GREAT CRIMINAL LAWYER THAT THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT ON THE SELECTION OF THE JURY
HE EVEN TRAVELED A TEDIOUS THIRTY MILES IN A POOR LITTLE RICKETY STAGECOACH TO COMPLY WITH THE DESIRE OF THE MISERABLE HAMLET OF CATTLEVILLE THAT HE WOULD LET ITS SUNDAY SCHOOL LOOK UPON HIM
THERE'S $200,000 COMING AND THAT WILL SET THINGS BOOMING AGAIN
AND THIS IS NOT ALL NANCY--IT ISN'T EVEN HALF
LAURA KEPT HER ROOM FOR TWO DAYS ON ONE EXCUSE AND ANOTHER--A NERVOUS HEADACHE A COLD--TO THE GREAT ANXIETY OF THE SENATOR'S HOUSEHOLD
THE FIRE ATE ITS WAY STEADILY DESPISING THE BUCKET BRIGADE THAT FOUGHT IT
HON
DOESN'T IT LOOK LIKE IT IT CERTAINLY DOES SAID THE SQUIRE VERY MUCH INTERESTED
I AM NOT SURE BUT IF SHE WENT AWAY TO SOME DISTANT SCHOOL INTO AN ENTIRELY NEW LIFE HER THOUGHTS WOULD BE DIVERTED ELI BOLTON ALMOST LAUGHED AS HE REGARDED HIS WIFE WITH EYES THAT NEVER LOOKED AT HER EXCEPT FONDLY AND REPLIED PERHAPS THEE REMEMBERS THAT THEE HAD NOTIONS ALSO BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED AND BEFORE THEE BECAME A MEMBER OF MEETING
CONFOUND THE GIRL HE WOULD SAY TO HIMSELF WHY DOES SHE NEVER TEASE HARRY AND THAT YOUNG SHEPLEY WHO COMES HERE
IS THAT TOO SOON NO ITS NOT TOO SOON
CLAIMED THAT HIS SPIES REPORTED EVERYTHING TO HIM AND THAT HERE A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OBJECTED THAT THIS EVIDENCE WAS IRRELEVANT AND ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE SPIRIT OF THE COMMITTEE'S INSTRUCTIONS BECAUSE IF THESE THINGS REFLECTED UPON ANY ONE IT WAS UPON MR DILWORTHY
NOW YOU'LL SEE IT NEVER WILL COLONEL NEVER IN THE WORLD
ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE LEFT WASHINGTON SHE HAD DECLARED THAT HE SHOULD NEVER GO OUT OF THE CITY ALIVE WITHOUT HER
IT WAS BY MY ADVICE AND IN COMPANY WITH ME SIR THAT HE WENT INTO THE OPERATION OF YES YES
AND MR BOLTON YIELDED
THIS WAS ALL A PLAIN REFLECTION UPON A BROTHER SENATOR
THEY ONLY WANTED TO RAISE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO CARRY ON THE CONTRACT--THAT EXPENDED THEY WOULD HAVE CITY BONDS
AND AT THAT TIME SHE REMEMBERED SHE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE MISTAKEN
HOW COULD THE COLONEL MANAGE TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS WIFE
SHE TRIED AND TRIED AGAIN
JURY READY OH I WISH THEY WOULD FINISH SAID WASHINGTON
MR BRAHAM HAVING SEATED HIMSELF DELIBERATELY SURVEYED THE ENTIRE HOUSE MADE A REMARK TO ONE OF HIS ASSISTANTS AND THEN TAKING AN IVORY-HANDLED KNIFE FROM HIS POCKET BEGAN TO PARE HIS FINGER NAILS ROCKING HIS CHAIR BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS SLOWLY
MR BOLTON TOOK HIS LETTERS LISTLESSLY DREADING TO OPEN THEM
I'VE WORKED HARD AND I'VE GOT THEM AT LAST
I AM ALL IN A FIDGET TO KNOW WHAT IT SAYS THE LETTER WAS OPENED WITHOUT ANY UNNECESSARY DELAY
DON'T DON'T DO IT AND ONE POOR FELLOW SAID
LAURA'S FACE SUDDENLY BRIGHTENED UNDER IT--ONLY FOR AN INSTANT IT IS TRUE BUT POOR LOUISE WAS GRATEFUL FOR EVEN THAT FLEETING RAY OF ENCOURAGEMENT
HE WROTE A LONG LETTER TO LAURA AN INCOHERENT PASSIONATE LETTER POURING OUT HIS LOVE AS HE COULD NOT DO IN HER PRESENCE AND WARNING HER AS PLAINLY AS HE DARED OF THE DANGERS THAT SURROUNDED HER AND THE RISKS SHE RAN OF COMPROMISING HERSELF IN MANY WAYS
I DON'T WISH TO SEEM TO THROW ANY SUSPICION ON ANYBODY'S STATEMENTS BECAUSE WE ARE ALL LIABLE TO BE MISTAKEN
DOWN YONDER THE BUSINESS STREETS RUNNING TO THE WHARVES
SHE HAD AN UNCLE ONCE THAT WAS BALD-HEADED AND USED TO HAVE FITS
BERIAH SELLERS AND THE COLONEL AGREED TO HAVE THE NAMES HEADED BY ALL THE SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE STATE AND BY A SPRINKLING OF EX-GOVERNORS AND EX-MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
THEN HE WAS ABOUT TO TURN BACK BUT HE SMILED AT THE THOUGHT AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY--SUCH A COAT AS THAT COULD BE OF LITTLE USE IN A CIVILIZED LAND
HE HAD INTRUDED HIMSELF TIME AND AGAIN AND ALWAYS WITH MOVING STORIES OF HIS POVERTY
SHE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD
LAURA WITH TEARS IN HER EYES TURNED A GRATEFUL LOOK UPON HER COUNSEL
QUEER
BOSWELL'S OFFICE AS POOR AS HE WENT
MRS HAWKINS SAID TAKE IT
DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE CONTENTED TO LIVE IN FALLKILL AND ATTEND THE COUNTY COURT ASKED ALICE WHEN PHILIP HAD OPENED THE BUDGET OF HIS NEW PROGRAMME
HARRY LAUGHED
OPEN YOUR EARS
I NEVER WAS
ONE OF OUR GRADUATES WENT TO CHICAGO AND HAS A NICE PRACTICE THERE
AND NEITHER THIS FOOLISH TALK NOR ANY OTHER THING SHALL PART US OR MAKE US LESS TO EACH OTHER THAN WE ARE THIS HOUR THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY SENSE OF SEPARATION OR ESTRANGEMENT BETWEEN THEM
IS IT AN APPROPRIATION
THEY TOOK A CUP OF COFFEE THAT MORNING AT A RESTAURANT
IT DON'T RESEMBLE ITS ANCIENT DIGNITY BUT IT FITS ITS MODERN STYLE LIKE A GLOVE THERE BEING NO LAW AGAINST MAKING OFFENSIVE REMARKS ABOUT U
WITH THE WAITER AT TABLE WITH ALL THE WITNESSES WITH THE POLICEMAN WITH THE LANDLORD WHO WANTED IT UNDERSTOOD THAT NOTHING OF THAT SORT HAD EVER HAPPENED IN HIS HOUSE BEFORE ALTHOUGH IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN FREQUENTED BY THE BEST SOUTHERN SOCIETY AND WITH MRS COL
WHAT ARE YOU WILTING DOWN LIKE THAT FOR
PAYS HER ANNUAL VISIT SITS IN HER CARRIAGE AND SENDS IN HER CARD WITH THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER TURNED DOWN WHICH SIGNIFIES THAT SHE HAS CALLED IN PERSON MRS B
AND BESIDES HERE IS THE BOOK ITSELF ON THE COUNTER SHE BOUGHT IT AND THE PROPRIETOR RETIRED FROM THE FIELD
BUT PRESENTLY THERE WAS A DOG-FIGHT OVER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE BLACKSMITH SHOP AND THE VISITORS SLID OFF THEIR PERCH LIKE SO MANY TURTLES AND STRODE TO THE BATTLE-FIELD WITH AN INTEREST BORDERING ON EAGERNESS
HE STOOD STILL A MOMENT AS ONE WHO IS TRYING TO BELIEVE SOMETHING AND CANNOT
WE'VE BEEN SO BUSY ABOUT THIS UNIVERSITY
IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY SIR A BUNDLE OF LETTERS WAS HERE HANDED TO THE WITNESS
THAT IS WHAT DILWORTHY SAID
HAWKINS SAID
IN CROSSING THE FERRY SHE ASKED HIM ABOUT THE SHIPPING IN SIGHT
WHAT WE WANT IS MORE MONEY
AFTER THE TWO HAD GAINED THE STEPS OF THE SENATOR'S HOUSE THEY STOOD A MOMENT LOOKING UPON THE LOVELY PROSPECT
LES SEE WHAT STATE'S MASSACHUSETTS IN MASSACHUSETTS KINDLY REPLIED HARRY IS IN THE STATE OF BOSTON ABOLISH'N WAN'T IT
LAURA INSANE
IT'S LIKE YOUR PLUCK AND SPIRIT CHILD BUT WE WILL HOPE THAT WE HAVEN'T GOT QUITE DOWN TO THAT YET THE GIRL'S EYES BEAMED AFFECTION UNDER HER MOTHER'S CARESS
WE'LL CALL FOR HALF A MILLION--GET IT AND GO FOR A MILLION THE VERY NEXT MONTH YES BUT THE COST OF IT THE PRESIDENT SMILED AND PATTED HIS SECRET LETTERS AFFECTIONATELY
THIS ALSO SEEMED TO BE THE OPINION OF MR BIGLER WHO HEARD OF IT AS SOON AS ANYBODY AND WITH THE IMPUDENCE OF HIS CLASS CALLED UPON MR BOLTON FOR A LITTLE AID IN A PATENT CAR-WHEEL HE HAD BOUGHT AN INTEREST IN
AND AFTER THAT HE COULD NOT ENJOY SOCIETY BECAUSE OF HIS CONSTANT DREAD OF THESE FEMALE AMBUSHES AND SURPRISES
THE MEN SEIZED HIM WRENCHED HIM FROM HIS SEAT DRAGGED HIM ALONG THE AISLE TEARING HIS CLOTHES THRUST HIM FROM THE CAR AND THEN FLUNG HIS CARPET-BAG OVERCOAT AND UMBRELLA AFTER HIM
BLISSFUL AS THE AFTERNOON WAS DELIVERED UP TO SUCH A REVEL AS THIS IT SEEMED AN ETERNITY SO IMPATIENT WAS HE TO SEE THE GIRL AGAIN
THE JURY LOOKED SCARED GENTLEMEN IN THIS CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IT NEEDED BUT A SPARK--I DO NOT SAY A SUGGESTION I DO NOT SAY A HINT--FROM THIS BUTTERFLY BRIERLY
STILL NO RESULT
NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO
THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN BAD HOTELS AND ONLY ONE GOOD ONE
BUT IF YOU WANT RAILS I'VE GOT EM HAINT I EPH HEAPS SAID EPH WITHOUT TAKING HIS EYES OFF THE GROUP AT THE TABLE
HIS COMMITTEE HAD INSTRUCTED HIM TO REPORT THE BILL FAVORABLY
CERTAIN OF THEM WITH A HIGHER ART AND TO HER A FINER CRUELTY A SHARPER TORTURE UTTERED NO ABUSE BUT ALWAYS SPOKE OF HER IN TERMS OF MOCKING EULOGY AND IRONICAL ADMIRATION
PLEASE LET ME KEEP IT MISS HAWKINS
THIS COUNTRY MUST HAVE WATER COMMUNICATION YOU'LL WANT A CONSIDERABLE APPROPRIATION COL
AND THUS FOR AN HOUR OR MORE THE DUCHESS MOVED THROUGH THE CRUSH IN A RAPTURE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER DOUBTS WERE DEAD AND GONE NOW SHE KNEW SHE COULD CONQUER HERE
AND THEN WHILE THE MYSTERIOUS COUGHING ROSE STRONGER AND STRONGER AND THE THREATENING GLARE REACHED FARTHER AND WIDER THE NEGRO'S VOICE LIFTED UP ITS SUPPLICATIONS
NOT THE LEAST OFFENSE INTENDED
ONE SO CONSPICUOUS AND SUCCESSFUL IN SOCIETY AS LAURA COULD NOT BE OUT OF THE WAY TWO DAYS WITHOUT REMARKS BEING MADE AND NOT ALL OF THEM COMPLIMENTARY
SELLERS ONCE MORE AT THE CAPITOL OF THE NATION STANDING GUARD OVER THE UNIVERSITY BILL
IT IS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
AND KIND TOO
WHEN THE SENATOR ARRIVED THE CHURCH WAS CROWDED THE WINDOWS WERE FULL THE AISLES WERE PACKED SO WAS THE VESTIBULE AND SO INDEED WAS THE YARD IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING
BUT THERE WAS NO TELLING TO WHAT DESPERATE LENGTHS HIS PASSION MIGHT NOT CARRY HIM
I'M TO HAVE WITH ANOTHER PARTY SAID HARRY A BIG CONTRACT IN THE ROAD AS SOON AS IT IS LET
VELL DERE IS SO MANY PEERS AND SO MANY ODER DHRINKS I GOT EM ALL SET DOWN VEN HE COOMES BACK IT WAS A LONG NIGHT FOR PHILIP AND A RESTLESS ONE
THEN FROM CATFISH TO BABYLON IT'S A LITTLE SWAMPY BUT THERE'S DEAD LOADS OF PEAT DOWN UNDER THERE SOMEWHERE
PERFECTLY STRAIGHT LINE-STRAIGHT AS THE WAY TO THE GRAVE
ALL PARTIES HAVING SEATED THEMSELVES THE DOWAGER DELIVERED HERSELF OF A REMARK THAT WAS NOT UNUSUAL IN ITS FORM AND YET IT CAME FROM HER LIPS WITH THE IMPRESSIVENESS OF SCRIPTURE
HIS WHOLE FRAME WAS RACKED AND WRENCHED WITH FETTERED HURRAHS
OH IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO MAKE A FORTUNE HENRY SAID
THE LECTURE AGENT RAN IN WITH A HURRIED QUESTION UPON HIS LIPS
HE CALLED WITH OFFICIAL IMPORTANCE IN HIS MIEN AT NO WALL STREET WHERE A GREAT GILT SIGN BETOKENED THE PRESENCE OF THE HEAD-QUARTERS OF THE COLUMBUS RIVER SLACK-WATER NAVIGATION COMPANY HE ENTERED AND GAVE A DRESSY PORTER HIS CARD AND WAS REQUESTED TO WAIT A MOMENT IN A SORT OF ANTE-ROOM
YOU MUST MAKE HIM MAKE THAT SPEECH
SAID HE HAD EVERY RAILWAY AND EVERY PUBLIC OFFICE AND STRONGHOLD OF POLITICAL POWER IN THE STATE UNDER HIS THUMB AND COULD SET UP OR PULL DOWN ANY MAN HE CHOSE
THIS ONE IS BETTER
WASHINGTON WAS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE SELLERS MANSION
THERE WAS NO NEED TO MOVE AN ADJOURNMENT
NOTHING STUDIED
LOVE SHE SAID WAS A WOMAN'S FIRST NECESSITY
IF HE WERE GOOD ENOUGH HE WOULD ATTACH HIMSELF TO THAT COMPANY OF YOUNG MEN IN THE THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY WHO WERE SEEING NEW YORK LIFE IN PREPARATION FOR THE MINISTRY
I SUPPOSE YOU HEARD OF THE FRIGHT WE HAD TWO WEEKS AGO LAST SATURDAY
ANOTHER JOURNAL BEGAN ITS EDITORIAL WITH LESS LYRICAL BEAUTY BUT WITH EQUAL FORCE
LET'S SEE THE FOREMAN PUT DOWN HIS LANTERN AND HANDED PHILIP A BLACK LUMP
TO BE LIFTED AND CARRIED BY THE ONE SHE LOVED MORE THAN HER OWN LIFE
ORSON BALSAM OF IOWA--HE'S MADE THE RIFFLE ON THE INJUN
BUT THEN--BUT THEN YES I KNOW SAID THE COLONEL
I LOVED MY FATHER AND I HONOR HIS MEMORY AND RECOGNIZE HIS GOOD INTENTIONS
CHANCE ALLUSIONS TO HIS BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT IN TOWN AND THE PLACE OF HIS FAMILY ON THE HUDSON COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE BY A MILLIONAIRE MORE NATURALLY
THEY SAT THEM DOWN ON A HIGH BENCH AND LOOKED MILES AHEAD AND SAW THE WOODED CAPES FOLD BACK AND REVEAL THE BENDS BEYOND
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE HISTORIAN WITH EVEN THE BEST INTENTIONS TO CONTROL EVENTS OR COMPEL THE PERSONS OF HIS NARRATIVE TO ACT WISELY OR TO BE SUCCESSFUL
BUT WHAT COULD I DO
HARRY HAD THE MOST BUOYANT CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN PROJECTS ALWAYS
STONE'S LANDING WAS MAKING QUITE A STIR IN THE VICINITY BY THIS TIME
THERE IS NO HOSPITAL FOR INSANE CRIMINALS
AND WHEN FOR THE LAST TIME THEY PITCHED THEIR TENTS METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING IT WAS AT THE GOAL OF THEIR HOPES THEIR NEW HOME
SHE IS CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING
A MAN HAS GOT TO BE GOOD TO SUCCEED AS HE HAS
TO A LARGE PORTION OF THE PEOPLE WHO FREQUENT WASHINGTON OR DWELL THERE THE ULTRA FASHION THE SHODDY THE JOBBERY ARE AS UTTERLY DISTASTEFUL AS THEY WOULD BE IN A REFINED NEW ENGLAND CITY
THE COLONEL AND WASHINGTON PROMISED TO PROCURE ALL THESE THINGS AND THEN TOOK THEIR SORROWFUL LEAVE A GREAT DEAL MORE AFFECTED THAN THE CRIMINAL WAS APPARENTLY BY HER SITUATION
HAWKINS SAID WAIT A BIT HAWKINS THOUGHT AGAIN
IT HAS THE ASPECT OF A FACTORY CHIMNEY WITH THE TOP BROKEN OFF
BUT HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY
NEW MISFORTUNES CAME INSTEAD
AND PHILIP PRESERVED THE EDITORIAL COMMENTS OF THREE OR FOUR OF THEM WHICH PLEASED HIM MOST
SOME OF HER NEIGHBORS HAD RELATIONS LIVING IN PHILADELPHIA AND IT SEEMED TO THEM SOMEHOW A GUARANTEE OF RESPECTABILITY TO HAVE RELATIONS IN PHILADELPHIA
THEN--LET ME OPEN MY KNIFE--TO HARK-FROM-THE-TOMB WHERE WE'LL PUT THE CANDLE-STICK--ONLY A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM HAIL COLUMBIA TO HARK-FROM-THE-TOMB--DOWN-GRADE ALL THE WAY
I HAVE NOT THE MONEY TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE CONTRACT RUTH HEARD THIS DISMAL NEWS WITHOUT GREAT SURPRISE
WHEN THE CONVEYANCE AT LENGTH DREW UP TO MR THOMPSON'S DOOR THE GENTLEMAN DESCENDED WITH GREAT DELIBERATION STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP RUBBED HIS HANDS AND BEAMING SATISFACTION FROM EVERY PART OF HIS RADIANT FRAME ADVANCED TO THE GROUP THAT WAS GATHERED TO WELCOME HIM AND WHICH HAD SALUTED HIM BY NAME AS SOON AS HE CAME WITHIN HEARING
THEY CAME BACK IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR SATISFIED AND HAPPY
I WOULD RATHER MY BODY WOULD STARVE AND DIE THAN YOUR MIND SHOULD HUNGER AND WITHER AWAY IN THIS LONELY LAND SPOKEN LIKE YOURSELF MY CHILD
THEY ARE EDUCATED AS IF THEY WERE ALWAYS TO BE PETTED AND SUPPORTED AND THERE WAS NEVER TO BE ANY SUCH THING AS MISFORTUNE
PRINTING'S NO BAGATELLE I CAN TELL YOU
THEN WHY THE DEVIL--MY NAME IS NOT BRYERSON BY THE WAY--WHY THE MISCHIEF DIDN'T THE COMPA--WHY WHAT IN THE NATION EVER BECAME OF THE APPROPRIATION
RUINED EVERYTHING TELL ME TELL ME TELL ME
FOR TWO DAYS HER LIFE WAS LIKE THE FLUTTERING OF A LIGHTED CANDLE IN THE WIND
IT WAS RIGHT THAT THIS MAN SHOULD BE HERS AND THERE WERE SOME OBSTACLES IN THE WAY
HE AT LEAST WAS LEARNING THE WORLD THE GOOD AND THE BAD OF IT AS MUST HAPPEN TO EVERY ONE WHO ACCOMPLISHES ANYTHING IN IT
WASHINGTON HAD NEVER BEEN IN SOCIETY IN ST LOUIS AND HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE WAYS OF ITS WEALTHIER CITIZENS AND HAD NEVER INSPECTED ONE OF THEIR DWELLINGS
LAURA LEFT THE COURT ROOM ACCOMPANIED BY HER MOTHER AND OTHER FRIENDS AMID THE CONGRATULATIONS OF THOSE ASSEMBLED AND WAS CHEERED AS SHE ENTERED A CARRIAGE AND DROVE AWAY
HE SAID
HE SAID
HE SAID
HE SAID
HE SAID
HE SAID
HE SAID
HE SAID
HE SAID
HE SAID
COURT NOW COMING IN AFTER BRIEF RECESS TO HEAR VERDICT
ONE AFTERNOON HE HAD A FIT AND JUMPED UP AND RUN OUT ON THE PORTICO OF THE HOTEL WITH NOTHING IN THE WORLD ON AND THE WIND A BLOWING LIKE ICE AND WE AFTER HIM SCARED TO DEATH
THERE WAS A LITTLE STIR WHEN THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY WITH TWO ASSISTANTS MADE HIS WAY IN SEATED HIMSELF AT THE TABLE AND SPREAD HIS PAPERS BEFORE HIM
MR HAWKINS WOULD HAVE NONE BUT THESE THREE THOUGH NEIGHBORLY ASSISTANCE WAS OFFERED BY OLD FRIENDS
AND THAT WAS THE REFLECTION THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN WASHINGTON DAYS AND DAYS AGO AND THROWN HIS FASCINATIONS ABOUT LAURA WITH PERMANENT EFFECT WHILE SHE WAS NEW AND STRANGE TO THE CAPITAL INSTEAD OF DAWDLING IN PHILADELPHIA TO NO PURPOSE
AND ALWAYS IN ELABORATE FULL DRESS
HE DIED AS HE HAD LATTERLY LIVED--WHOLLY ALONE AND FRIENDLESS
ALL HE DESIRED IN RETURN WAS THAT WHEN THE BALLOTING BEGAN NOBLE SHOULD CAST HIS VOTE FOR HIM AND SHOULD EXPLAIN TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT UPON LOOKING INTO THE CHARGES AGAINST MR DILWORTHY OF BRIBERY CORRUPTION AND FORWARDING STEALING MEASURES IN CONGRESS HE HAD FOUND THEM TO BE BASE CALUMNIES UPON A MAN WHOSE MOTIVES WERE PURE AND WHOSE CHARACTER WAS STAINLESS
HAWKINS PUT UP THE FIRST PALING FENCE THAT HAD EVER ADORNED THE VILLAGE
H THERE WAS ANOTHER TRUNK CLOSE BY--A WORN AND SCARRED AND ANCIENT HAIR RELIC WITH B
SHALL BE RE-ELECTED TO-DAY BY AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY GOOD AGAIN SAID THE COLONEL
FOR THREE OR FOUR NIGHTS MRS HAWKINS AND LAURA HAD BEEN WATCHING BY THE BEDSIDE
WE'LL GET TRAUTWINE AND SOME OF THOSE BOOKS YES BUT WHAT IS IT FOR WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT WHY DON'T YOU SEE
A VERY AGREEABLE MAN
THERE WAS IN HER MANNER OR FACE NEITHER SHAME NOR BOLDNESS AND WHEN SHE TOOK HER SEAT IN FULL VIEW OF HALF THE SPECTATORS HER EYES WERE DOWNCAST
I'M DOWN HERE NOW WITH REFERENCE TO A LITTLE OPERATION--A LITTLE SIDE THING MERELY
CONSEQUENTLY THERE WAS HARDLY A FAMILY AT LEAST IN THE WEST BUT HAD A WASHINGTON IN IT--AND ALSO A LAFAYETTE A FRANKLIN AND SIX OR EIGHT SOUNDING NAMES FROM BYRON SCOTT AND THE BIBLE IF THE OFFSPRING HELD OUT
ONE DAY A FRIEND OVERHEARD A CONVERSATION LIKE THIS:--AND NATURALLY CAME AND TOLD HER ALL ABOUT IT
THAT WOULD NOT BE REGULAR THEN WHY WASTE ALL THE SESSION IN THAT TOMFOOLERY OF TRYING MEMBERS IT IS USUAL
AFTER THAT IF THE PARTIES GO ON CALLING UPON EACH OTHER ONCE A YEAR IN OUR LARGE CITIES THAT IS SUFFICIENT AND THE ACQUAINTANCESHIP HOLDS GOOD
HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO RUN IN DEBT AND THEREFORE HE GAVE THE MEN THEIR DISCHARGE
SHIFTLESSNESS AND POVERTY REIGNED IN THE PLACE
BUT ALWAYS WHEN I HAD FINISHED SOUNDING YOU I MANIPULATED YOU THROUGH AN AGENT
WITHOUT THE ADVENTITIOUS AIDS OF DRESS OR JEWELS OR THE FINE MANNERS OF SOCIETY--HARRY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT
UPON IT WAS PINNED A FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER DRY AND YELLOW ALSO
MR SHERIFF YOU WILL ATTEND AT ONCE TO THE EXECUTION OF THIS DECREE LAURA WAS OVERWHELMED AND TERROR-STRICKEN

IT WAS NEVER INTENDED FOR ANYTHING BUT A MERE NEST EGG FOR THE FUTURE AND REAL APPROPRIATIONS TO CLUSTER AROUND INDEED
COME COME AND SHE DRAGGED HIM AWAY
WHAT DID HE SAY OH HE BEAT AROUND A LITTLE
I'M GOING TO BEGIN AGAIN TOO INDEED YES SIR
HERE WAS HE PHILIP STERLING CALLING HIMSELF A GENTLEMAN IN A BRAWL WITH A VULGAR CONDUCTOR ABOUT A WOMAN HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
THEY SAT BY THE HOUR IN THE SHADE OF THE PILOT HOUSE ON THE HURRICANE DECK AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE CURVING EXPANSES OF THE RIVER SPARKLING IN THE SUNLIGHT
HE COULD NOT KEEP HIS EYES ON THE CHARMERS HE TALKED TO
NO--I SEE YOU--STILL
DAT MISTER PRIERLY HE DON'T NEVER COME BACK HERE NO MORE AIN'T IT WHY ASKED PHILIP
HIS CONNECTION WITH HER AND WITH THIS TRAGEDY IS NOT KNOWN BUT HE WAS ALSO TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AND WILL BE DETAINED AT LEAST AS A WITNESS
ON THE FERRY-BOAT PHILIP BOUGHT AN EVENING PAPER FROM A BOY CRYING ERE'S THE EVENING GRAM ALL ABOUT THE MURDER AND WITH BREATHLESS HASTE--RAN HIS EYES OVER THE FOLLOWING
HE SPOKE VERY DISTINCTLY HOWEVER AND IF HIS NATIONALITY COULD BE DISCOVERED IN HIS SPEECH IT WAS ONLY IN A CERTAIN RICHNESS AND BREADTH OF TONE
WASHINGTON WROTE SELLERS OFFICIALLY NOW AND THEN
IT CALLS IT HIGHWAY ROBBERY THAT SOUNDS SOMETHING LIKE
OVER BEYOND THE WATER ON A DISTANT ELEVATION YOU SEE A SQUAT YELLOW TEMPLE WHICH YOUR EYE DWELLS UPON LOVINGLY THROUGH A BLUR OF UNMANLY MOISTURE FOR IT RECALLS YOUR LOST BOYHOOD AND THE PARTHENONS DONE IN MOLASSES CANDY WHICH MADE IT BLEST AND BEAUTIFUL
LAURA THANKED HIM ONCE MORE
THEREFORE SHE WOULD SOME DAY BEGIN THE SEARCH WHEN OPPORTUNITY SHOULD OFFER
CALL IT THE REVELATIONS OF A WOMAN'S LIFE
WE SHALL ALL NEED MERCY HE SAID
WAS NOT YET QUITE READY THE PROJECT SHRANK A LITTLE IN THE PRESENCE OF VASTER SCHEMES
FINISH YOUR INVENTION FOR MAKING WINDOW-GLASS OPAQUE NO SIR I HAVE GIVEN THAT UP
ORDER THE SPEAKER AFTER USING HIS GAVEL VIGOROUSLY)--"IT IS MOVED AND SECONDED THAT THE HOUSE DO NOW ADJOURN
THE DYING DEPOSITION OF COL
MR BOLTON WAS TEN YEARS YOUNGER THE NEXT MORNING
WHO IS HE WHERE IS HE
SHE HAS GREAT TALENT AND WILL MAKE A BIG MATCH
THERE WAS SOMETHING THRILLING ABOUT IT TO A STRANGER NOT TO SAY AWE INSPIRING.]--STAND OFF THE CAT'S TAIL CHILD CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING?--COME COME COME RODERICK DHU IT ISN'T NICE FOR LITTLE BOYS TO HANG ONTO YOUNG GENTLEMEN'S COAT TAILS--BUT NEVER MIND HIM WASHINGTON HE'S FULL OF SPIRITS AND DON'T MEAN ANY HARM
IT HAPPENED THAT RUTH WAS ONE EVENING DEEP IN A LINE OF INVESTIGATION WHICH SHE COULD NOT FINISH OR UNDERSTAND WITHOUT DEMONSTRATION AND SO EAGER WAS SHE IN IT THAT IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD NOT WAIT TILL THE NEXT DAY
YOU WAS A STRANGER TO ME A MINUTE AGO BUT YOU AIN'T NOW SAID ANOTHER
THANK GOD SHE SAID THEY WILL NEVER KNOW THEY NEVER WOULD KNOW
IF HE HAD HAD MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY THREE DAYS GRUB HE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED THE GENEROUS OFFER BUT AS IT WAS HE COULD NOT CONSENT TO BE LESS MAGNANIMOUS THAN THE MEN AND SO HE DECLINED IN A MANLY SPEECH
WILLFUL GENEROUS FORGIVING IMPERIOUS AFFECTIONATE IMPROVIDENT BEWITCHING IN SHORT--WAS LAURA AT THIS PERIOD
HAVE YOU BREAKFASTED COLONEL HASTILY
SCARE UP ALL THE MEN YOU CAN AND PUT THEM TO WORK AT ONCE
GAVE INSTANCES SHOWING WHERE AND HOW HE HAD USED THIS POWER
HE HAD GONE SOME DISTANCE BEFORE HE THOUGHT OF HIS COAT
BUT UPON ONE OCCASION OLD SENATOR THOMPSON SAID TO ME ITS MY OPINION COLONEL SELLERS DID YOU EVER SEE ANY BODY WHO HAD SEEN HIM NO SIR
IT WAS GOLDEN SEPTEMBER ALSO AT FALLKILL
I HATED TO DISAPPOINT THE SENATOR BUT I HAD TO OUT WITH IT TELL HIM WE DIDN'T HAVE EM NOT STEADY
HE TOOK A LEADING PART IN PRAYER MEETINGS
I AM GOING TO BEGIN MY LIFE OVER AGAIN AND BEGIN IT AND END IT WITH GOOD SOLID WORK
THE SPEAKERS WON THE DEATHLESS HATRED OF THE HOUSE BY THESE DELAYS BUT AT LAST THERE WAS AN END AND HOPE REVIVED
GOOD-BYE UNCLE
AM I IN SOME FAR-OFF MONARCHY LOOKING UPON LITTLE PRINCES AND PRINCESSES
SO THIS POOR LITTLE BOY GREW UP TO BE A MAN AND HAD TO GO OUT IN THE WORLD FAR FROM HOME AND FRIENDS TO EARN HIS LIVING
AND THE WORLD NEVER KNOWS HOW MANY WOMEN THERE ARE LIKE ALICE WHOSE SWEET BUT LONELY LIVES OF SELF-SACRIFICE GENTLE FAITHFUL LOVING SOULS BLESS IT CONTINUALLY
HE HAD FINE HORSES AND CARRIAGES NOW AND CLOSED UP HIS WHISKEY MILL
HE DWELT LONG UPON THAT PAINFUL EPISODE OF THE PRETENDED MARRIAGE AND THE DESERTION
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ELSE
SELBY NOT SO LONG AS YOU LIVE LAURA IN HER PASSION WAS HURRIED ON TO SAY
WHY WHAT AN INFANT YOU ARE WASHINGTON--WHAT A GUILELESS SHORT-SIGHTED EASILY-CONTENTED INNOCENT YOU ARE MY POOR LITTLE COUNTRY-BRED KNOW-NOTHING
BEFORE THEM WERE A DOZEN LOG CABINS WITH STICK AND MUD CHIMNEYS IRREGULARLY DISPOSED ON EITHER SIDE OF A NOT VERY WELL DEFINED ROAD WHICH DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW ITS OWN MIND EXACTLY AND AFTER STRAGGLING THROUGH THE TOWN WANDERED OFF OVER THE ROLLING PRAIRIE IN AN UNCERTAIN WAY AS IF IT HAD STARTED FOR NOWHERE AND WAS QUITE LIKELY TO REACH ITS DESTINATION
WASHINGTON EMILY DON'T YOU KNOW ME
WOMAN--SOMETHING ABOUT WOMAN I SHOULD SAY
HE LOOKED WORN AND TIRED
THE NEWS OF HIS SUCCESS HAD PRECEDED HIM AND WHILE HE WAITED FOR THE TRAIN HE WAS THE CENTER OF A GROUP OF EAGER QUESTIONERS WHO ASKED HIM A HUNDRED THINGS ABOUT THE MINE AND MAGNIFIED HIS GOOD FORTUNE
I HAVE HUNTED HIGH AND LOW FOR HIM AND INQUIRED OF EVERYBODY BUT IN VAIN
1
BUT I DON'T BLAME MY HUSBAND FOR I DO THINK THAT WHEN THAT MAN GETS HIS HEAD FULL OF A NEW NOTION HE CAN OUT-TALK A MACHINE
SHE WAS NOT TOO DULL TO PERCEIVE THAT THE SPEECHES OF SOME OF THE YOUNGER STATESMEN WERE DELIVERED ABOUT AS MUCH AND PERHAPS MORE AT HER THAN TO THE PRESIDING OFFICER
HARRY THOROUGHLY BELIEVED IN ALL HIS PROJECTS AND INVENTIONS AND LIVED DAY BY DAY IN THEIR GOLDEN ATMOSPHERE
THE COLONEL PROTESTED HE COULDN'T THINK OF IT AND MUTTERED SOMETHING TO THE BARKEEPER ABOUT HANGING IT UP BUT THE VENDER OF EXHILARATION MADE NO SIGN AND PHILIP HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF PAYING THE COSTLY SHOT
WHEN THE PAST SEEMS A STORM-SWEPT DESOLATION LIFE A VANITY AND A BURDEN AND THE FUTURE BUT A WAY TO DEATH
FOR A LITTLE WHILE SHE LIVED IN THIS ATMOSPHERE WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER
THE PISTOL IDENTIFIED BY THE OFFICER AS THE ONE USED IN THE HOMICIDE WAS PRODUCED WASHINGTON ADMITTED THAT IT WAS HIS
AND I WOULDN'T LEAVE PHILIP AS LONG AS HE STAYS THERE WHEN THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WERE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO THE HOTEL MR PHILIP WHO WAS NOT IN VERY GOOD HUMOR BROKE OUT WHAT THE DEUCE HARRY DID YOU GO ON IN THAT STYLE TO THE MONTAGUES FOR GO ON CRIED HARRY
AND BESIDES HE WAS SUCH A HANDSOME MAN
IT'S DEMOCRATIC WASHINGTON IS
BUT GOOD LORD DOSE CHILEN DON'T B'LONG HEAH DEY'S F'M OBEDSTOWN WHAH DEY DON'T KNOW NUFFIN AN YOU KNOWS YO OWN SEF DAT DEY AIN'T SPONSIBLE
DON'T YOU SEE
WHAT NOTHINGS DO PEOPLE USUALLY SAY IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN IF THEY ARE THREE-SCORE AND TEN
A LITTLE FURTHER ON HE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WERE SOME PAPERS OF VALUE IN ONE OF THE POCKETS OF THE RELIC AND THEN WITH A PENITENT EJACULATION HE TURNED BACK PICKED UP THE COAT AND PUT IT ON
WHY INDEED MIGHT WE NOT FEEL PITY FOR A WOMAN WHOSE BRILLIANT CAREER HAD BEEN SO SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED IN MISFORTUNE AND CRIME
IT CARRIED OF COURSE AND THE COMMITTEE WAS APPOINTED
HE SAID THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE A CURIOUS MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE CASE
PHILIP LOOKED AT HIS TORN CLOTHES AND THOUGHT WITH DISGUST OF HIS HASTE IN GETTING INTO A FIGHT WITH SUCH AN AUTOCRAT
GO STRAIGHT AND DO IT THERE'S A GOOD FELLOW A MOMENT OR TWO LATER THE TWO SWORN FRIENDS OF THE PENSION BILL WERE TALKING TOGETHER EARNESTLY AND SEEMINGLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE MOVING THRONG ABOUT THEM
STATE WHY I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF HIS DEATH SIR
HE IS PROSPEROUS TOO I HEAR
THE BARON USED TO SAY TAKE MUSTARD SELLERS TRY THE MUSTARD,--A MAN CAN'T KNOW WHAT TURNIPS ARE IN PERFECTION WITHOUT MUSTARD BUT I ALWAYS SAID NO BARON I'M A PLAIN MAN AND I WANT MY FOOD PLAIN--NONE OF YOUR EMBELLISHMENTS FOR BERIAH SELLERS--NO MADE DISHES FOR ME
DON'T YOU THINK SO COLONEL WELL I DUNNO
THE OLD INSTINCT CAME UPON HIM TO CLING TO THE LAND JUST A LITTLE LONGER AND GIVE IT ONE MORE CHANCE
BUT STILL IT IS A VERY GOOD AVERAGE
AND SEE YE NOT YON BRAID BRAID ROAD THAT LIES ACROSS THE LILY LEVEN
THERE IS NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD SIR THAT PURSUES CORRUPTION AS INVETERATELY AS WE DO
AND AS THE MONTHS WENT BY IT WAS NATURAL THAT THE HORROR OF HER CRIME SHOULD BECOME A LITTLE INDISTINCT IN MEMORY WHILE THE HEROINE OF IT SHOULD BE INVESTED WITH A SORT OF SENTIMENTAL INTEREST
DR
FOR SOME DAYS LAURA HAD BEEN A FREE WOMAN ONCE MORE
AT LEAST IT WAS WHAT PASSED FOR A SCHOOL IN THOSE DAYS
I WOULDN'T COLONEL
CRASHES IT IN HIS NERVOUS HAND AND THROWS IT ON THE TABLE LAURA GREW UP IN HER HUMBLE SOUTHERN HOME A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE THE JOY OF THE HOUSE THE PRIDE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE LOVELIEST FLOWER IN ALL THE SUNNY SOUTH
THA--THA--THERE
HER ABSORPTION IN THE SMALL GAIETIES OF THE SOCIETY THERE SURPRISED HIM
SO HE SET HIS LEG AND BANDAGED IT UP AND FIXED HIS RIBS AND GAVE HIM A DOSE OF SOMETHING TO QUIET DOWN HIS EXCITEMENT AND PUT HIM TO SLEEP--POOR THING HE WAS TREMBLING AND FRIGHTENED TO DEATH AND IT WAS PITIFUL TO SEE HIM
HE IS BETTER ONE DAY AND WORSE THE NEXT AND IS OUT OF HIS MIND A GOOD DEAL OF THE TIME
PERHAPS YOU MIGHT KNOW HIM IF I COULD THINK OF HIS NAME
DID I EVER SHOW ANY WANT OF CONFIDENCE IN YOU HARRY AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND WHICH HARRY PRESSED WITH EFFUSION--SOMETHING IN HER MANNER TOLD HIM THAT HE MUST BE CONTENT WITH THAT FAVOR
BUT SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD FEEL SAFER IF WASHINGTON WOULD LET HER TAKE ONE OF HIS PISTOLS
SELLERS WANTED TO TALK WITH HIM ABOUT SOME PATENT REMEDY HE HAS EYE WATER OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT WHICH HE WANTS TO INTRODUCE INTO EUROPE
POLLY MARK MY WORDS--IN THREE YEARS FROM THIS HAWKEYE'LL BE A HOWLING WILDERNESS
TELL HER A LIE FOR A POOR DEVIL'S SAKE PLEASE
IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE COLONEL IN HIS GENERAL PATRIOTIC LABORS NEGLECTED HIS OWN AFFAIRS
HIS MANNER WAS SUBDUED AND HE SPOKE IN SO LOW A VOICE THAT IT WAS ONLY BY REASON OF PERFECT SILENCE IN THE COURT ROOM THAT HE COULD BE HEARD
I NEVER SAW AN EASTERN MAN SAID JEFF WHO KNEW HOW TO DRINK FROM A JUG WITH ONE HAND
IF HE HAD BEFRIENDED A MAN ONCE AND BEEN CHEATED BY HIM THAT MAN APPEARED TO HAVE A CLAIM UPON HIM FOREVER
TAINE TAINE IS IT HYMNS NO IT ISN'T HYMNS
DOES THEE THINK I LACK NERVE
ARE YOU FOND OF WATERING-PLACES MISS HAWKINS I HAVE REALLY HAD NO EXPERIENCE OF THEM BUT I HAVE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG DESIRE TO SEE SOMETHING OF FASHIONABLE WATERING-PLACE LIFE WE OF WASHINGTON ARE UNFORTUNATELY SITUATED IN THAT RESPECT SAID THE DOWAGER
BUT HOW DO THOSE LETTERS STRIKE YOU THEY STRIKE ME DUMB
SI HAWKINS HAS BEEN A GOOD FRIEND TO ME AND I BELIEVE I CAN SAY THAT WHENEVER I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO PUT HIM INTO A GOOD THING I'VE DONE IT AND DONE IT PRETTY CHEERFULLY TOO
HE WAS DETAINED IN A LITTLE CONSULTATION AFTER THE CONGRESSIONAL PRAYER MEETING
HARRY ASKED THE SENATOR IF THERE WAS A CLASS OF YOUNG LADIES FOR HIM TO TEACH AND AFTER THAT THE SENATOR DID NOT PRESS THE SUBJECT
I AM AWARE THAT YOU OWN 75,000 ACRES OF LAND IN EAST TENNESSEE AND WITHOUT SACRIFICING YOUR TIME I WILL COME TO THE POINT AT ONCE
WHEREAS HE NEVER UNDERTOOK ANYTHING THAT HE DID NOT THINK OF RUTH IN CONNECTION WITH IT HE NEVER MADE A PLAN THAT HAD NOT REFERENCE TO HER AND HE NEVER THOUGHT OF ANYTHING AS COMPLETE IF SHE COULD NOT SHARE IT
LORD I WISH I HAD THE MONEY RIGHT NOW
ALL THE WOMEN TALKED POLITICS AS NATURALLY AND GLIBLY AS THEY TALK FASHION OR LITERATURE ELSEWHERE
SHE NEEDN'T BE LOOKING DOWN HE THOUGHT FOR SHE WAS EVER SO MUCH SHORTER THAN TALL PHILIP
IT IS ONLY A BIT OF PLEASANTRY
SHE WANTED TO BE RICH SHE WANTED LUXURY SHE WANTED MEN AT HER FEET HER SLAVES AND SHE HAD NOT--THANKS TO SOME OF THE NOVELS SHE HAD READ--THE NICEST DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN NOTORIETY AND REPUTATION
THERE WAS NO ESCAPE FROM THE MURDER OR ITS PREMEDITATION
THE BILL WAS PUT UPON ITS FINAL PASSAGE ALMOST WITHOUT DISSENT AND THE CALLING OF THE AYES AND NAYS BEGAN
IT MUST HAVE BEEN BY A LUCKY PREMONITION OF THIS THAT THEY ALL HAD BRANDY FLASKS WITH WHICH TO QUALIFY THE WATER OF THE COUNTRY
AND NOW THAT THE GOOD-BYES WERE ENDED HE BUNDLED WASHINGTON'S BAGGAGE IN AND DROVE AWAY WITH THE EXILE
HE WAS LOOKING INTO HER EYES AS HE HAD LOOKED IN THOSE OLD DAYS WHEN NO BIRDS OF ALL THOSE THAT SANG IN THE GROVES WHERE THEY WALKED SANG A NOTE OF WARNING
THESE ARE FROM NEW JERSEY--I IMPORTED THEM MYSELF
IT IS NOT FOR ME TO BE A GIRL
AM I RIGHT CERTAINLY VERY WELL
WHAT WOULD YOU DO FIRST AFTER YOU HAD TOMAHAWKED YOUR MOTHER AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE FOR PUTTING TOO MUCH SUGAR IN YOUR COFFEE
WHAT WE WANT ABROAD IS GOOD EXAMPLES OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER
DILWORTHY SAID HE WAS SURPRISED
IT IS PROBABLY A CANARD
IT WAXED GRAYER AND STILL GRAYER DURING THE LAGGING SUSPENSE THAT SUCCEEDED IT AND AFTER THE CRASH WHICH RUINED HIS LAST HOPE--THE FAILURE OF HIS BILL IN THE SENATE AND THE DESTRUCTION OF ITS CHAMPION DILWORTHY
GOOD MORNING SIR
HE SAID YOU WERE A YOUNG MAN OF GREAT PROMISE THE SENATOR DID CALL NEXT DAY AND THE RESULT OF HIS VISIT WAS THAT HE WAS CONFIRMED IN HIS IMPRESSION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM VERY ATTRACTIVE TO LADIES
THE BOAT HAD LANDED AND THE DEAD AND THE WOUNDED WERE BEING CONVEYED TO THE SHORE
THE GREAT BATTLE HAD BEEN FOUGHT BUT THE MEASURE HAD STILL TO ENCOUNTER THE SCRUTINY OF THE SENATE AND PROVIDENCE SOMETIMES ACTS DIFFERENTLY IN THE TWO HOUSES
YOU STAND AT THE BACK OF THE CAPITOL TO TREAT YOURSELF TO A VIEW AND IT IS A VERY NOBLE ONE
ALL THE CONDITIONS OF INTENSE EXCITEMENT MEET IN A MURDER TRIAL
WHY SHOULD HE HAVE PUT HIMSELF IN SUCH A RIDICULOUS POSITION
I WAS NEARLY OUT OF MY WITS BY THIS TIME
THERE WAS A STRETCH OF LEVEL VALLEY WITH SILENT FARM HOUSES THE OCCUPANTS ALL AT REST WITHOUT TROUBLE WITHOUT ANXIETY
I AM READY TO GIVE UP
THEY'LL SEE IT
BATHING THEIR CHINLESS FACES AND BODIES WITH LINSEED OIL AND LIME WATER AND COVERING THE PLACES WITH BULGING MASSES OF RAW COTTON THAT GAVE TO EVERY FACE AND FORM A DREADFUL AND UNHUMAN ASPECT
IN VAIN JUST AS SHE IS ABOUT TO FIND HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN-HE DISAPPEARS HE IS GONE HE VANISHES
IT WAS A PLAN THAT THE SENATOR COULD UNDERSTAND WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF EXPLANATION FOR HE SEEMED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE LIKE IMPROVEMENTS ELSEWHERE
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE THEM
HE WORKED ON DAY AFTER DAY AND WEEK AFTER WEEK WITH A FEVERISH ANXIETY
WIFE AND THE CHILDREN ARE JUST PERISHING TO LOOK AT YOU
SHALL WE BURY THE HATCHET AND BE GOOD FRIENDS AND RESPECT EACH OTHER'S LITTLE SECRETS ON CONDITION THAT I VOTE AYE ON THE MEASURE WITH ALL MY HEART MR TROLLOP
ONE DOESN'T COME ACROSS SILK LIKE THAT IN THIS COUNTRY--IT'S THE REAL--YOUNG HYSON I'M TOLD BY THIS TIME THE INCIDENT WAS FORGOTTEN FOR THE HOUSE WAS AT WAR AGAIN
YOU SEE HOW IT SWEEPS ROUND THE TOWN--FORTY-NINE MILES TO THE MISSOURI
BUT LET THEM KEEP ON THINKING SO
AS THE COLD FACTS WERE UNROLLED FEAR SETTLED UPON THE LISTENERS
HE'S GOING INTO BUSINESS WHAT SORT OF BUSINESS CAN A YOUNG MAN GO INTO WITHOUT CAPITAL HE DOESN'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SAID RUTH A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT LAND AND RAILROADS AND THEE KNOWS FATHER THAT FORTUNES ARE MADE NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW IN A NEW COUNTRY I SHOULD THINK SO YOU INNOCENT PUSS AND IN AN OLD ONE TOO
BUT IT IS DREADFUL TO THINK OF HER FATE WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY WILL HANG A WOMAN
THEY BOTH ATTACKED MR BOLTON BEHIND HIS BACK AS A SWINDLER AND CIRCULATED THE STORY THAT HE HAD MADE A FORTUNE BY FAILING
HE FOUND THAT SOME OF HIS GOOD THINGS WERE BEING REPEATED ABOUT THE TOWN
I'VE NO DOUBT I CAN GET YOU A CHANCE TO GO IF YOU'LL GO BUT IN WHAT CAPACITY WOULD I GO WELL I'M GOING AS AN ENGINEER
THE SENATE OWED IT TO THE UPHOLDING OF ITS ANCIENT DIGNITY TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS MAN NOBLE--HE SHOULD BE CRUSHED
BUT SHE WILL FIND BY AND BY THAT WHAT SHE TOOK FOR A SLEEPING GARRISON WAS AN AMBUSCADE CHAPTER XXXVIII
WHEN COL
WHEN COL
HE BELIEVED THAT NOBLE WOULD MAKE A GOOD USE OF THIS MONEY AND THAT IT WOULD CHEER MANY A SAD HEART AND NEEDY HOME
RUTH'S PROPOSED OCCUPATION ASTONISHED PHILIP IMMENSELY BUT WHILE HE ARGUED IT AND DISCUSSED IT HE DID NOT DARE HINT TO HER HIS FEAR THAT IT WOULD INTERFERE WITH HIS MOST CHERISHED PLANS
THE RIO COFFEE WHICH AT FIRST SEEMED EXECRABLE TO THE TASTE TOOK TO ITSELF AN IMPROVED FLAVOR WHEN WASHINGTON WAS TOLD TO DRINK IT SLOWLY AND NOT HURRY WHAT SHOULD BE A LINGERING LUXURY IN ORDER TO BE FULLY APPRECIATED--IT WAS FROM THE PRIVATE STORES OF A BRAZILIAN NOBLEMAN WITH AN UNREMEMBERABLE NAME
SELBY
SELBY
SELBY
SELBY
SELBY
SELBY
IT WAS NOT A REMUNERATIVE STUDY
WAS HE IN LOVE
A CAT HAD BEGUN TO DRINK FROM THE PAIL BUT THE EXERTION WAS OVERTAXING HER ENERGIES AND SHE HAD STOPPED TO REST
THE FAMILY WERE AS CONTENTED NOW AND AS FREE FROM CARE AS THEY COULD HAVE BEEN WITH A FORTUNE
THE COLONEL FOUND HIMSELF IN A RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE--NO $1,200 SALARY FORTHCOMING
HENRY BRIERLY TOOK THE STAND
ALL ITS INHABITANTS SEEMED HIGHLY FAVORED DWELLING IN EASE AND SURROUNDED BY SUPERIOR ADVANTAGES
THAT'S DISMAL BY NO MEANS WHY ISN'T IT
NOW LET'S FIGURE UP A LITTLE ON THE PRELIMINARIES
AND SOMETIMES I THINK I'LL HAVE--WELL SOMEHOW I DON'T KNOW--SOMEHOW I AIN'T CERTAIN
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO GLIDE RIGHT ALONG EASY AND COMFORTABLE NOW
THAT'S JUST IT
THE HOSTILITY ROUSED BY THE PRESS WOULD THEN DISAPPEAR AND THE BILL WOULD SHINE FORTH IN ITS TRUE AND NOBLE CHARACTER
I NEVER WEAR AN UMBRELLA IN THE HOUSE--DID ANYBODY NOTICE IT
JUST EAT FROM FOUR TO SEVEN GOOD-SIZED TURNIPS AT A MEAL AND DRINK FROM A PINT AND A HALF TO A QUART OF WATER AND THEN JUST SIT AROUND A COUPLE OF HOURS AND LET THEM FERMENT
AND WHAT IF I ADDED THAT I PUT THE MEASURE THROUGH MYSELF
WERE THE DOCTORS CLEAR THAT THE DECEASED HAD NO DISEASE WHICH MIGHT SOON HAVE CARRIED HIM OFF IF HE HAD NOT BEEN SHOT THERE WAS EVIDENTLY ONE JURY MAN WHO DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE LIFE AND WAS WILLING TO STAKE A GENERAL AVERAGE AS THE JURY ALWAYS DOES IN A CIVIL CASE DECIDING NOT ACCORDING TO THE EVIDENCE BUT REACHING THE VERDICT BY SOME OCCULT MENTAL PROCESS
AS HE READ HIS FACE LIGHTENED AND HE FETCHED SUCH A SIGH OF RELIEF THAT MRS BOLTON AND RUTH BOTH EXCLAIMED
AND PRIVATELY SHE EVEN BELIEVED IT MIGHT--FOR SHE HAD BROUGHT ALL THE WOMEN WHOM SHE HAD SEEN SINCE SHE LEFT HOME UNDER SHARP INSPECTION AND THE RESULT HAD NOT BEEN UNSATISFACTORY TO HER
THE DEEP HUSH WAS ONLY INTERRUPTED BY SOBS FROM THE CHILDREN GROUPED ABOUT THE BED
GENTLEMEN DID SHE EVER EMERGE FROM THIS DELIRIUM
SHE ALWAYS LOVED THAT KIND O FLOWERS
WELL YOU WON'T BE ANY STRANGERS HERE I CAN TELL YOU
HE'S IN THAT PILOT HOUSE NOW SHOWING THOSE MUD TURTLES HOW TO HUNT FOR EASY WATER THAT'S IT
YOU HAVE DONE YOURSELF NO WRONG
EVERY REMARK HE MADE DELIGHTED HIS HEARERS AND COMPELLED THEIR APPLAUSE
HIS SPIRITS ROSE WITH THEIR USUAL ELASTICITY AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF CENTRE STREET AND HE INSISTED ON GIVING PHILIP AND HIS FRIENDS A ROYAL SUPPER AT DELMONICO'S AN EXCESS WHICH WAS PERHAPS EXCUSABLE IN THE REBOUND OF HIS FEELINGS AND WHICH WAS COMMITTED WITH HIS USUAL RECKLESS GENEROSITY
THESE CELEBRATED CONTRACTORS USUALLY MADE MORE MONEY DURING THE SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE AT HARRISBURG THAN UPON ALL THEIR SUMMER WORK AND THIS WINTER HAD BEEN UNFRUITFUL
NOTHING LIKE THIS SIR NOTHING LIKE THIS PROTESTED THE WITNESS
THE LAND BILL IS JUST AS FAR AWAY AS EVER AND THE TRIAL IS CLOSER AT HAND
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO ABOUT IT OH NOTHING
WE'LL HAVE TWO-THIRDS OF CONGRESS IN TIME DILWORTHY MUST SURELY KNOW I UNDERSTAND HIM
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU
SUCH OF THEM AS ARE IMMEDIATELY EMPLOYED ABOUT THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS ARE NOT ONLY LIBERALLY PAID ALSO BUT ARE REMEMBERED IN THE CUSTOMARY EXTRA COMPENSATION BILL WHICH SLIDES NEATLY THROUGH ANNUALLY WITH THE GENERAL GRAB THAT SIGNALIZES THE LAST NIGHT OF A SESSION AND THUS TWENTY PER CENT
THE COLONEL BELIEVED THAT HARRY WAS THE PRINCE OF LOBBYISTS A LITTLE TOO SANGUINE MAY BE AND GIVEN TO SPECULATION BUT THEN HE KNEW EVERYBODY
BUT IT WAS
HOW FAR FROM HERE IS COLUMBUS RIVER
LET ME SEE IT
IN HER LIMITED EXPERIENCE SHE BROUGHT EVERYTHING TO THE JUDGMENT OF HER OWN CONSCIENCE AND SETTLED THE AFFAIRS OF ALL THE WORLD IN HER OWN SERENE JUDGMENT HALL
THE FAMILY LOST EVERYTHING SLAVES AND THAT SORT OF THING YOU KNOW IN THE WAR
THIS MORNING OCCURRED ANOTHER OF THOSE SHOCKING MURDERS WHICH HAVE BECOME THE ALMOST DAILY FOOD OF THE NEWSPAPERS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE SOCIALISTIC DOCTRINES AND WOMAN'S RIGHTS AGITATIONS WHICH HAVE MADE EVERY WOMAN THE AVENGER OF HER OWN WRONGS AND ALL SOCIETY THE HUNTING GROUND FOR HER VICTIMS
ON FOREIGN COUNTRIES I THINK
AND WHEN THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SAW THAT HE HAD A FIT EVERY LADY SCATTERED FOR HER ROOM AND NOT A GENTLEMAN LIFTED HIS HAND TO HELP THE WRETCHES
AND SO IN THOSE DAYS CHILDREN GREW UP WITH THE IDEA THAT STAGE-COACHES ALWAYS TORE AND ALWAYS TOOTED
YOU GOT TO CAMP IN MY HOUSE AS LONG AS YOU HANG OUT HERE SAID ONE
WELL SAID MR THOMPSON RISING FROM HIS SEAT AND MOVING TOWARDS HIS TENT THE RAILROAD HAS COME TO STONE'S LANDING SURE
I THINK IT IS THIS THAT GIVES VARIETY TO OUR TASTES LAURA COINCIDED WITH THIS VIEW
AND HE DID
PRETTY THIN IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THIS DESERTION HAS HAD A DAMAGING EFFECT
WASHINGTON GOT UP AND WALKED THE FLOOR A WHILE IN A RESTLESS SORT OF WAY AND FINALLY WAS ABOUT TO SIT DOWN ON THE HAIR TRUNK
A CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATION COSTS MONEY
IT'S WARM FOR THE SEASON CONTINUED BLANCHE PLEASANTLY
BUT HE WENT SO FAR THAT HE DOUBTED HIMSELF IF THE LORD HEARD HIM WHEN HE WENT BY
IT IS CUSTOMARY
NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE TENNESSEE LAND
AND THEN UPON THE THREE MILLIONS
THE MEDICINE PHIALS HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BEDSIDE AND PUT OUT OF SIGHT AND ALL THINGS MADE ORDERLY AND MEET FOR THE SOLEMN EVENT THAT WAS IMPENDING
MIND THEY WERE NOT FURIOUS BECAUSE BRIBERY WAS UNCOMMON IN OUR PUBLIC LIFE BUT MERELY BECAUSE HERE WAS ANOTHER CASE
HE'S A VERY CAUTIOUS MAN
WHY DIDN'T HE SEND HIS WIFE HOME
SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT HE NEVER DID WHEN THEY WERE OPEN EITHER
PRESENTLY THE UNITED STATES MAIL ARRIVED ON HORSEBACK
THE JUDGE AND I WERE JUST LAYING OUR PLANS TO BUY THE PILOT KNOB AND COLONEL ONE MOMENT
HARRY WAS ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH HIS OWN SITUATION
SHE DID NOT HEED IF SHE HEARD THE BUSY AND WONDERING GOSSIP OF RELATIONS AND ACQUAINTANCES GOSSIP THAT HAS NO LESS CURRENCY AMONG THE FRIENDS THAN ELSEWHERE BECAUSE IT IS WHISPERED SLYLY AND CREEPS ABOUT IN AN UNDERTONE
BY SUPPER TIME TO-MORROW YOU'LL BE RE-ELECTED
HER PRIDE WAS STUNG
THE GAS WAS LIT THE CROWD IN THE GALLERIES BEGAN TO THIN BUT THE CONTEST CONTINUED
EVEN A RUSH LIKE THIS DID NOT FILL UP THE POSTMASTER'S WHOLE MONTH THOUGH AND THEREFORE HE KEPT STORE IN THE INTERVALS
DO ALL MEN WHO WEAR BIG DIAMOND BREAST-PINS FLOURISH THEIR KNIVES AT TABLE AND USE BAD GRAMMAR AND CHEAT O CHILD THEE MUSTN'T BE TOO OBSERVING
OH THIS IS LIKE ALL MY LIFE--FAILURE DISAPPOINTMENT MISERY--ALWAYS MISERY ALWAYS FAILURE
HE COULD SING A SONG VERY WELL NOT IN TIME TO BE SURE BUT WITH ENTHUSIASM
BUT RUTH CONFESSED THAT SHE WAS TIRED OF THEM AND ALSO OF THE MINT
SHE TURNED UP THE GAS AND SOUGHT THE GLASS
HIGGINS HAD NOT COME TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY IN WASHINGTON FOR NOTHING
SELLERS FOR THE UNRESERVED HOSPITALITIES OF THE TOWN
IT WAS RUTH'S SUGGESTION THAT THE COATS WOULD BE IMPROVED BY A SINGLE HOOK AND EYE SEWED ON IN THE SMALL OF THE BACK WHERE THE BUTTONS USUALLY ARE
OH THIS IS A HAPPINESS
BUT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY FOLLOW THAT WHERE THIS PECULIAR ROCK IS COAL MUST LIE ABOVE IT OR BEYOND IT
SHE SAT DOWN BY HER TABLE LEANED HER ELBOWS UPON IT AND PUT HER FACE IN HER HANDS
IF SENATOR DILWORTHY WASN'T IN IT HE SHOULD SUSPECT THERE WAS A FRAUD ON THE GOVERNMENT HE SAID THAT DID HE YES
HOW WAS THE COTTONWOOD STUMP ON THE FALSE POINT BELOW BOARDMAN'S ISLAND THIS MORNING WATER JUST TOUCHING THE ROOTS WELL IT'S PRETTY CLOSE WORK
DID HIS WIFE LIVE SHE WONDERED
IF LAURA AT TWELVE WAS BEGINNING TO BE A BEAUTY THE THOUGHT OF IT HAD NEVER ENTERED HER HEAD
THE SPEECH IS MADE AND THERE AN END
WHEN THE JUDGE'S FIRST BANKRUPTCY CAME UPON HIM A HOMELY HUMAN ANGEL INTRUDED UPON HIM WITH AN OFFER OF $1,500 FOR THE TENNESSEE LAND
WHAT A FOOL I HAVE BEEN
THE LADY APPEARED TO BE BESIDE HERSELF WITH RAGE OR EXCITEMENT AND TREMBLED VERY MUCH WHEN THE GENTLEMEN TOOK HOLD OF HER
THERE WAS A QUESTION IN BOTH THEIR HEARTS--A QUESTION THAT ROSE UP AND ASSERTED ITSELF WITH MORE AND MORE PERTINACITY AS THE HOURS WORE ON--BUT BOTH HESITATED TO GIVE IT VOICE--BOTH KEPT SILENCE--AND--WAITED
SELLERS MODIFIED HIS HARANGUE AND FOR A MOMENT THROTTLED IT DOWN TO THE ORTHODOX PITCH FOR A BLESSING AND THEN INSTANTLY BURST FORTH AGAIN AS FROM A PARENTHESIS AND CLATTERED ON WITH MIGHT AND MAIN TILL EVERY STOMACH IN THE PARTY WAS LADEN WITH ALL IT COULD CARRY
WHEN THE WRECK IS CLEARED AWAY THIS SWEET LITTLE GIRL IS FOUND AMONG THE PANIC STRICKEN SURVIVORS IN THE MIDST OF A SCENE OF HORROR ENOUGH TO TURN THE STEADIEST BRAIN
GENTLEMEN ALLOW ME THE HONOR TO INTRODUCE MY FRIEND GENERAL SELLERS THE HUMANE FRIEND OF THE NIGGRO
SELLERS HAVE MADE AND LOST TWO OR THREE MODERATE FORTUNES IN THE MEANTIME AND ARE NOW PINCHED BY POVERTY
SHE WOULD MAKE THE BEST OF WHAT WAS LEFT FOR HER AMONG THE POSSIBILITIES
THE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS CALMLY UP AND DOING
SENATOR I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU SIR WHEN HE COMES ALONG BACK RE-ELECTED YOU KNOW
EVERYBODY TOOK A DRINK IN AN OPEN MANNER WHENEVER HE WISHED TO DO SO OR WAS ASKED AS IF THE HABIT NEEDED NO CONCEALMENT OR APOLOGY
SHE SENT FOR THE LECTURE AGENT AND MATTERS WERE SOON ARRANGED
THESE HE USED TO READ ALOUD TO HIS FRIENDS AFTERWARDS AND ASK THEM TO GUESS FROM WHICH JOURNAL EACH OF THEM HAD BEEN CUT
JUDGE
HER TEARS FLOWED SILENTLY
HE HAD BROWN HAIR HAZEL EYES SET WIDE APART A BROAD BUT NOT HIGH FOREHEAD AND A FRESH WINNING FACE
HE PLAYS WELL ENOUGH TO GO ON THE STAGE PHILIP HATES SCIENCE OF ANY KIND AND STEADY APPLICATION RETORTED HARRY
PHILIP WAS CAST DOWN ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN SO FOOLISH AS TO SEND THE NEWS TO PHILADELPHIA BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS WRITING ABOUT
I SHALL FIND IT SOME DAY
BUT WE HURRIED OFF THE SERVANTS AFTER OUR OWN DOCTOR AND TELEGRAPHED MOTHER--SHE WAS IN NEW YORK AND RUSHED DOWN ON THE FIRST TRAIN
THE NIGGRO IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN STAND THE FEVER AND AGUE OF THIS REGION THE CONVALESCENCE OF THE ENGINEER WAS THE SIGNAL FOR BREAKING UP QUARTERS AT ST LOUIS AND THE YOUNG FORTUNE-HUNTERS STARTED UP THE RIVER IN GOOD SPIRITS
ITS PREPARATION AND THAT OF MORE MINUTE PLOTS OF THE NEW CITY CONSUMED THE VALUABLE TIME OF SELLERS AND HARRY FOR MANY WEEKS AND SERVED TO KEEP THEM BOTH IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS
COMMUNICATION THAT SUMMER AS MAY BE IMAGINED WAS NEITHER REGULAR NOR FREQUENT BETWEEN THE REMOTE CONFEDERATE CAMP AT HARDING AND HAWKEYE AND LAURA WAS IN A MEASURE LOST SIGHT OF--INDEED EVERYONE HAD TROUBLES ENOUGH OF HIS OWN WITHOUT BORROWING FROM HIS NEIGHBORS
IT WAS ASTONISHING HOW MANY NEW ENGLAND CLERGYMEN IN THE TIME OF THE PETROLEUM EXCITEMENT TOOK CHANCES IN OIL
THE JUDGE AND LAWYERS WERE IN THEIR SEATS
WITH YOU
THERE ARE PERSONS WHOM WE ALL KNOW TO WHOM HUMAN CONFIDENCES TROUBLES AND HEART-ACHES FLOW AS NATURALLY AS STREAMS TO A PLACID LAKE
BUT MIND--DON'T EVER HINT THAT YOU GOT IT FROM ME
WASHINGTON SPRANG FORWARD WITH THE EAGER QUESTION ON HIS LIPS AND THE SENATOR SAID
EVERYBODY EXPECTS A GRAND ASSAULT IN FORCE
UNCLE DAN'L HEADED A CAUTIOUS RECONNAISSANCE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE LOG
HE WAS NOT ABLE TO DENY THAT HE BELIEVED SENATOR DILWORTHY TO BE GUILTY--BUT WHAT THEN
OF LAURA HE KNEW NOT MUCH EXCEPT THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF UNCOMMON FASCINATION AND HE THOUGHT FROM WHAT HE HAD SEEN OF HER IN HAWKEYE HER CONDUCT TOWARDS HIM AND TOWARDS HARRY OF NOT TOO MUCH PRINCIPLE
AND THEN LET ME THINK
LIFE MUST BE BEGUN AGAIN--AT EIGHT AND TWENTY YEARS OF AGE
I HAVE TO GO ABOUT THIS UNIVERSITY BILL THE VOTE OF AN ABSENT MEMBER WE MUST HAVE HERE SENATOR DILWORTHY CANNOT GO
WIDOW HOPKINS KEPT ME--I HAVEN'T ANY PATIENCE WITH SUCH TEDIOUS PEOPLE
HOW CHARMED THE VERY AIR SEEMED BY HER PRESENCE
SHE'S COOL ENOUGH FOR A SURGEON ANYWAY HE SPOKE FEELINGLY FOR HE HAD VERY LIKELY BEEN WEIGHED IN RUTH'S CALM EYES SOMETIME AND THOROUGHLY SCARED BY THE LITTLE LAUGH THAT ACCOMPANIED A PUZZLING REPLY TO ONE OF HIS CONVERSATIONAL NOTHINGS
THE SUBSTANCE OF IT WAS THAT HIS MURDERESS IS A MISS LAURA HAWKINS WHOM HE HAD KNOWN AT WASHINGTON AS A LOBBYIST AND HAD SOME BUSINESS WITH HER
AND HE ATTRIBUTED HIS OWN ILL-LUCK TO THE SENATOR'S APPEARANCE
I AM SATISFIED OF THAT ALL RIGHT THEN
HE WILL BE HERE SOON HARRY'S UNCLE CAME WITH OTHER FRIENDS AND IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY MADE SUCH A SHOWING TO THE AUTHORITIES THAT HARRY WAS RELEASED ON GIVING BONDS TO APPEAR AS A WITNESS WHEN WANTED
LOVE BEING FORFEITED
HE WALKED THE FLOOR FEVERISHLY HIS MIND TORTURED BY INDECISION
NOW AND THEN SHE CLASPED THEM THEN UNCLASPED THEM THEN TAPPED THE ENDS OF THE FINGERS TOGETHER
AND IF I WIN THE GAME WILL IT BE WORTH ITS COST AFTER ALL
NOW THEN--THERE YOU ARE
MY RESPECTS THE HOSPITABLE GENTLEMAN HAVING DISPOSED OF HIS LIQUOR REMARKING THAT IT WAS NOT QUITE THE THING--"WHEN A MAN HAS HIS OWN CELLAR TO GO TO HE IS APT TO GET A LITTLE FASTIDIOUS ABOUT HIS LIQUORS"--CALLED FOR CIGARS
THE FAMILY WENT WITH HER
I READ A GOOD DEAL AND SHALL BE IN NEARLY EVERY DAY AND I WOULD BE SORRY TO HAVE YOU THINK ME A CUSTOMER WHO TALKS TOO MUCH AND BUYS TOO LITTLE
FAME DOES NOT PLACE YOU IN THE LIST OF LADIES WHO RANK BELOW PERFECTION THIS HAPPY SPEECH DELIGHTED MR BUCKSTONE AS MUCH AS IT SEEMED TO DELIGHT LAURA
A MOMENT LATER JUDGE O'SHAUNNESSY ENTERED AT THE REAR DOOR AND TOOK HIS SEAT IN ONE OF THE CHAIRS BEHIND THE BENCH
THE CAPITAL OF THE GREAT REPUBLIC WAS A NEW WORLD TO COUNTRY-BRED WASHINGTON HAWKINS
NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD OLD MCDOWELLS SAYS JUST FILL YOURSELF UP TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY AND YOU CAN SNAP YOUR FINGERS AT THE PLAGUE
SHE SAID IT WAS LOBBY BUSINESS FOR THE UNIVERSITY
AND IN THE MEANTIME WHAT ARE WE WORRYING ABOUT THAT $200,000 APPROPRIATION FOR
HE ANSWERED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO SUCH TRACT OF LAND AS THIS
I WISHED TO SEE YOU ON BUSINESS MR TROLLOP I JUDGED SO
THIS INFORMATION WAS FURNISHED BY COL
THESE NEIGHBORS STOOD A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE MAIL CARRIER REFLECTIVELY WHILE HE TALKED
SILAS THAT IS MR HAWKINS AND SHE ALWAYS LOVED LAURA AS IF SHE HAD BEEN THEIR OWN CHILD
YOU'LL FEEL LIKE A FIGHTING COCK NEXT DAY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES LATER THE COLONEL'S TONGUE WAS STILL CHATTERING AWAY--HE HAD PILED UP SEVERAL FUTURE FORTUNES OUT OF SEVERAL INCIPIENT OPERATIONS WHICH HE HAD BLUNDERED INTO WITHIN THE PAST WEEK AND WAS NOW SOARING ALONG THROUGH SOME BRILLIANT EXPECTATIONS BORN OF LATE PROMISING EXPERIMENTS UPON THE LACKING INGREDIENT OF THE EYE-WATER
AND HIS WIFE!--DOES HE TAKE HIS FAMILY
BUT IF YOU'LL PUT A MORTGAGE ON IT FOR THE NORTHERN ROAD I WOULDN'T MIND TAKING AN INTEREST IF PENNYBACKER IS WILLING
OH BLESS MY SOUL YOU CAN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE NOT PAID THESE PEOPLE BUT I DO MEAN IT THE PRESIDENT ROSE AND WALKED THE FLOOR LIKE A MAN IN BODILY PAIN
THERE IS NO HURRY
THE SQUIRE'S HOUSE WAS A DOUBLE LOG CABIN IN A STATE OF DECAY
A FOURTH JOURNAL BEGAN ITS REMARKS AS FOLLOWS THE FULLNESS WITH WHICH WE PRESENT OUR READERS THIS MORNING THE DETAILS OF THE SELBY-HAWKINS HOMICIDE IS A MIRACLE OF MODERN JOURNALISM
BUCKSTONE ACTS
WASHINGTON HAD BEEN IN HAWKEYE OFF AND ON ATTRACTED AWAY OCCASIONALLY BY SOME TREMENDOUS SPECULATION FROM WHICH HE INVARIABLY RETURNED TO GEN
MY HOUSE MY YARD EVERYTHING AROUND ME IN FACT SHOWS THAT I AM BECOMING ONE OF THESE CATTLE--AND I USED TO BE THRIFTY IN OTHER TIMES HE WAS NOT MORE THAN THIRTY-FIVE BUT HE HAD A WORN LOOK THAT MADE HIM SEEM OLDER
I HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT HERE AS YOU WE'LL SEE SAID THE CONDUCTOR ADVANCING WITH THE BRAKEMEN
PHILIP SAW THE SITUATION CLEARLY ENOUGH
EVIDENTLY THE TURNIPS WERE FERMENTING HE FORCED HIMSELF TO SIT STILL AS LONG AS HE COULD BUT HIS ANGUISH CONQUERED HIM AT LAST
WHO SHALL SET HIMSELF UP TO JUDGE HUMAN MOTIVES
THE OCCASION WAS ONE TO CALL OUT HIS FINEST POWERS OF PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND ONE HE LONG DWELT ON WITH PLEASURE
SHE WAS GROWING USED TO CELEBRITY AND COULD ALREADY SIT CALM AND SEEMINGLY UNCONSCIOUS UNDER THE FIRE OF FIFTY LORGNETTES IN A THEATRE OR EVEN OVERHEAR THE LOW VOICE THAT'S SHE AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE STREET WITHOUT BETRAYING ANNOYANCE
SHE SAID NO NEVER MIND
JEALOUSY THE CAUSE
AND TESTIFIED TO THE FOLLOWING EFFECT
HIS EYE FELL UPON THAT AND IT DECIDED HIM
BEFORE SHE DID THAT HOWEVER SHE TOOK OUT HER NOTE BOOK AND WAS SOON DEEP IN ITS CONTENTS
HE GAINED PERMISSION TO SEE HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF AN OFFICER DURING THE DAY AND HE FOUND THAT HERO VERY MUCH CAST DOWN
WE ARE INCLINED TO TAKE A MEDIUM GROUND AND AVER THAT WOMAN DRESSES TO PLEASE HERSELF AND IN OBEDIENCE TO A LAW OF HER OWN NATURE
I WISH I HAD SOMEBODY TO DECIDE FOR ME THE POCKET BOOK LAY OPEN IN HIS HAND WITH LOUISE'S SMALL LETTER IN VIEW
WHAT DOES SHE SAY SHE SAYS COME HOME--HER FATHER HAS CONSENTED AT LAST MY BOY I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU
THAT BRAHAM'S A WONDERFUL MAN
BUT I AM SURPRISED ABOUT THE WINES
DURING THE DELAY THE SPECTATORS EXHIBITED UNEXAMPLED PATIENCE FINDING AMUSEMENT AND RELIEF IN THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENTS OF THE COURT THE PRISONER AND THE LAWYERS
NOBODY TO GO TO NOBODY THAT K'YERS FOR HIM--AND ALL OF US IS SO PUT TO IT FOR TO GET ALONG AND FAMILIES SO LARGE HAWKINS UNDERSTOOD
BUT YOUR CRITICISMS ARE TOO FULL OF BROTHERLY PARTIALITY TO BE DEPENDED ON WASHINGTON
A MAJORITY OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE THE SAME EACH--SAY $40,000
HE WAS CONSTANTLY CATCHING HIMSELF IN A REVERIE--REVERIES MADE UP OF RECALLING HOW SHE LOOKED WHEN SHE FIRST BURST UPON HIM
WOULD THIS FEELING RATHER INCLINE YOU AGAINST A CAPITAL CONVICTION THE JUROR SAID HE HADN'T ANY FEELING AND DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THE PARTIES
HER NOTE TO HIM WAS HERE SHOWN
BEFORE THE WEEK WAS OVER PHILIP THOUGHT HE HAD A NEW LIGHT ON THE CHARACTER OF RUTH
THIS INVESTIGATION IS LIKELY TO BE LIKE ALL OTHER SENATORIAL INVESTIGATIONS--AMUSING BUT NOT USEFUL
I MADE HER ACQUAINTANCE IN HAWKEYE MISSOURI M.....M...M
STRAIGHTWAY ALL THE PAPERS WERE FILLED WITH HER NAME AND ALL THE DEAD WALLS FLAMED WITH IT
BUT HE ALSO AGREED THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO KEEP QUIET UNTIL MORE CONVINCING DEVELOPMENTS WERE FORTHCOMING
GEORGE SHOUTED THROUGH THE TUBE
NOW THERE'S AN OPERATION IN CORN THAT LOOKS WELL
HE HAD TOO MUCH POLITENESS AND GOOD SENSE AND KINDNESS TO SHOW IN HIS MANNER THAT HE WAS HIT
I RECKON WE'LL GET ALONG SI OH YES IT WILL ALL COME OUT RIGHT OLD MOTHER
SHUST WHAT I SAID MISTER SEDERLING THE LANDLORD OF THE ILIUM HOTEL KEPT REPEATING
YOU DEAR FAITHFUL ONES WILL HAVE THE REWARD OF YOUR PATIENT WAITING NOW
HOWEVER I DON'T KNOW--I DON'T KNOW
SENATOR DILWORTHY SAID HE HAD COME IN LATE
IT IS STRANGE SHE WROTE TO PHILIP IN ONE OF HER OCCASIONAL LETTERS THAT YOU NEVER TOLD ME MORE ABOUT THIS DELIGHTFUL FAMILY AND SCARCELY MENTIONED ALICE WHO IS THE LIFE OF IT JUST THE NOBLEST GIRL UNSELFISH KNOWS HOW TO DO SO MANY THINGS WITH LOTS OF TALENT WITH A DRY HUMOR AND AN ODD WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND YET QUIET AND EVEN SERIOUS OFTEN--ONE OF YOUR CAPABLE NEW ENGLAND GIRLS
BY AND BY SHE TURNED
DIED OF THE FEVER LAST NIGHT
IT HAD NOTHING COMPARABLE TO IT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE UNIVERSITY
I USED TO THINK MY OLD MAMMY WAS HANDSOME HOW INTERESTING YOUR LIFE MUST HAVE BEEN
THE VOTING CEASED AND THEN THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF DEAD SILENCE WHILE THE CLERK MADE UP HIS COUNT
HE FELT THAT PERHAPS HE OUGHT NOT TO ASK A BLESSING UPON THE SORT OF LABOR THAT WAS ONLY A VENTURE
THE COURT WAITED FOR SOME TIME BUT THE JURY GAVE NO SIGNS OF COMING IN
HE RESOLVED TO GO THAT VERY DAY AND GIVE THE COLONEL A PLEASANT SURPRISE
A LITTLE MONEY WOULD MAKE A PRINCE OF COL
I HAVE BEGUN AND I WILL NEVER TURN BACK
WHILE LAURA IS ON HER ERRAND TO FIND MR BUCKSTONE IT MAY NOT BE OUT OF THE WAY TO REMARK THAT SHE KNEW QUITE AS MUCH OF WASHINGTON LIFE AS SENATOR DILWORTHY GAVE HER CREDIT FOR AND MORE THAN SHE THOUGHT PROPER TO TELL HIM
HE EXPECTED TO LIVE TO SEE THE DAY WHEN THE YOUTH OF THE SOUTH WOULD RESORT TO ITS MINES ITS WORKSHOPS ITS LABORATORIES ITS FURNACES AND FACTORIES FOR PRACTICAL INSTRUCTION IN ALL THE GREAT INDUSTRIAL PURSUITS
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER BEAUTY HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND HER BRILLIANT POSITION IN SOCIETY AND HER DOUBTFUL POSITION IN SOCIETY
HE SWORE HIS FALSE SOUL INTO PERDITION
COULD READ IF IT WAS NECESSARY
MRS HIGGINS--"IS FRANCOIS HEALTH GOOD NOW MRS OREILLE MRS O.--(THANKFUL FOR THE INTERVENTION)--"NOT VERY
DEY AIN'T TWO MARS CLAY--DAYS DE SAME ONE
THE SUBSTANCE OF THEM WAS THAT SOME ONE IN THE EAST HAD BEEN INQUIRING OF MAJOR LACKLAND ABOUT A LOST CHILD AND ITS PARENTS AND THAT IT WAS CONJECTURED THAT THE CHILD MIGHT BE LAURA
FACTORIES MULTIPLIED
MR BRIERLY IS NOTHING--SIMPLY NOTHING
BUT LET'S DROP THE MATTER
BUT THOUGH THIS LETTER MAY HAVE GLOWED IT WAS NOT WITH THE HEAT OF BURNING ANTHRACITE
AND IF A SENTIMENTAL SQUEAMISHNESS HELD ONE OR TWO OF THEM BACK FROM TAKING A LESS ROSY VIEW OF NAPOLEON OUR HOSPITALITIES TIED HIS TONGUE AT LEAST AND HE SAID NOTHING AT ALL AND SO DID US NO HARM
QUITE LIKELY SHE WILL SOON FIND THAT SHE NEEDS FIRST A MORE GENERAL CULTURE AND FALL IN WITH THY WISH THAT SHE SHOULD SEE MORE OF THE WORLD AT SOME LARGE SCHOOL THERE REALLY SEEMED TO BE NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE AND MARGARET CONSENTED AT LENGTH WITHOUT APPROVING
YOU REACH YOUR HOTEL PRESENTLY--AND HERE LET US DRAW THE CURTAIN OF CHARITY--BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU HAVE GONE TO THE WRONG ONE
A SUGGESTION CAME INTO HER MIND PRESENTLY AND SHE SAID
BUT IT IS NO MATTER NOW
BUT THE BRAND OFFERED DID NOT SUIT HIM
HAWKINS APPROACHED EXPECTING HIS FOOTFALL TO ATTRACT ATTENTION BUT IT DID NOT
SEVERAL OF US TOOK TURNS AT LOG-ROLLING IN WASHINGTON AND IF WE HAD CHARGED ANYTHING FOR THAT SERVICE NONE OF THAT $10,000 WOULD EVER HAVE REACHED NEW YORK IF YOU HADN'T LEVIED THE ASSESSMENT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A CLOSE PLACE I JUDGE CLOSE
BUT AS BEFORE THE FRIENDS OF THE MEASURE STOOD FIRM AND VOTED IN A SOLID BODY EVERY TIME AND SO DID ITS ENEMIES
LORD I WISH I'D TAKEN YOUR ADVICE
THE SPECTATORS CROWDED WITHIN THE BAR AND SURROUNDED LAURA WHO CALMER THAN ANYONE ELSE WAS SUPPORTING HER AGED MOTHER WHO HAD ALMOST FAINTED FROM EXCESS OF JOY
PROVIDENCE SEEMS TO FURTHER OUR EFFORTS SIGNED ABNER DILWORTHY U
OH I GOT QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE HUMAN FRAME YOU MUST HAVE SAID PHILIP
BUT I PREFER THE QUIET OF HOME AND THE LOVE OF THOSE I KNOW AND HER FACE WORE A LOOK OF SWEET CONTENTMENT AND UNWORLDLINESS THAT FINISHED MR HARRY BRIERLY FOR THE DAY
HE KNEW NOTHING SERIOUSLY AGAINST HER AND IF HARRY WAS DESPERATELY ENAMORED OF HER WHY SHOULD HE NOT WIN HER IF HE COULD
RUTH WAS A STUDY TO ALICE
SHE SAID IT WOULD BE THE GREATEST OF FAVORS IF HE WOULD GO WITH HER AND PROTECT HER--NOT AT HIS OWN EXPENSE AS FAR AS RAILWAY FARES WERE CONCERNED OF COURSE
ONE TWO EIGHT SEVENTEEN TWENTY-ONE M'M IT TAKES A HEAP FOR A MAJORITY
SQUIRE HAWKINS AND HIS TENNESSEE LAND--HE DECIDES TO REMOVE TO MISSOURI CHAPTER II
AND SOLD HIS VOTE
BUT HE ONLY SAID HAS THEE CONSULTED THY MOTHER ABOUT A CAREER I SUPPOSE IT IS A CAREER THEE WANTS RUTH DID NOT REPLY DIRECTLY
YOU NEEDN'T LAUGH
HE'S AN HONEST SOUL AND MEANS THE VERY BEST IN THE WORLD BUT I'M AFRAID I'M AFRAID HE'S TOO FLIGHTY
SHE HAD A RAVING HEADACHE AND THE SENATOR MUST GO WITHOUT HER
BUT BY AND BY SOMETHING HAPPENED
BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WHEN A GIRL ONCE GETS TALKED ABOUT--IT'S ALL UP WITH HER--THE WORLD WON'T EVER LET HER ALONE AFTER THAT THE ONLY COMMENT LAURA MADE UPON THIS REVELATION WAS
BUT CHEER UP DEAR CHEER UP AND THE COLONEL BROKE DOWN ENTIRELY
SO THIS WAS INDEED A MOMENTOUS DAY
THE PRESIDENT LIVES THERE
3 LAY BEYOND
THE SQUIRE WAS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
HE SPOKE WITH ONLY THE SLIGHTEST ACCENT ONE THAT HAD BEEN INHERITED BUT NOT CULTIVATED
HE NEVER TIRED OF LISTENING TO HIS STORIES OF WHAT HE HAD DONE AND OF WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO
SHE HAD RISEN FROM HER CHAIR AND WAS LEANING AGAINST THE PIANO PRESSING HER LEFT HAND AGAINST THE VIOLENT BEATING OF HER HEART
THAT IS HAPPINESS CERTAINLY
AMONG OTHERS A CONFEDERATE COLONEL--A STRANGER--HANDSOME MAN WITH GRAY HAIR PROBABLY YOU DIDN'T NOTICE HIM USES A CANE IN WALKING
DURING THE NIGHT IT FROZE HARD AND THE WIND BLEW SOME CHIMNEYS DOWN
SUCH YOUNG GENTLEMEN AT THIS TIME DID NOT COME VERY DISTINCTLY INTO RUTH'S HORIZON EXCEPT AS AMUSING CIRCUMSTANCES
WHAT WOULD HE CARE FOR IT THEN
HE WAS ALL READY TO BE CAUGHT DAYS AND DAYS AGO--I SAW THAT VERY WELL
HE LIKED HER MIRTHFUL AND TEASING WAYS AND NOT LESS A KEEN BATTLE OVER SOMETHING SHE HAD READ
IN CAMP HE WOULD GET HIMSELF UP IN THE MOST ELABORATE TOILET AT HIS COMMAND POLISH HIS LONG BOOTS TO THE TOP LAY OUT HIS WORK BEFORE HIM AND SPEND AN HOUR OR LONGER IF ANYBODY WAS LOOKING AT HIM HUMMING AIRS KNITTING HIS BROWS AND WORKING AT ENGINEERING
AT THE TIME OF FIRST FINDING LAURA ON THE STEAMBOAT DID SHE NOTICE THAT LAURA'S MIND WAS AT ALL DERANGED
BUT IT WAS NOT THE BEST WORLD OF THAT SORT FOR THE SMALL LIBRARIES SHE HAD ACCESS TO IN HAWKEYE WERE DECIDEDLY MISCELLANEOUS AND LARGELY MADE UP OF ROMANCES AND FICTIONS WHICH FED HER IMAGINATION WITH THE MOST EXAGGERATED NOTIONS OF LIFE AND SHOWED HER MEN AND WOMEN IN A VERY FALSE SORT OF HEROISM
GOD BLESS MY SOUL AT HIS AGE I WAS FULL OF PLANS
HE MADE A DOZEN STEPS AND THEN STOPPED VERY SUDDENLY
DRINK DEEP UNTIL THE HABITS OF THE SLAVE THE SINS OF EMPTINESS GOSSIP AND SPITE AND SLANDER DIE
TO EVERYBODY IN FACT
CHAPTER LVII
IF THEY DISAPPROVE THOUGHT HE I'VE DONE MY DUTY BY LETTING THEM KNOW
THE COLONEL WAS AS MUCH A LOVER OF FARMING AND OF HORSES AS THOMAS JEFFERSON WAS
THE COLONEL DIVIDED WITH THEM THE MONEY HE STILL HAD IN BANK--AN ACT WHICH HAD NOTHING SURPRISING ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE WAS GENERALLY READY TO DIVIDE WHATEVER HE HAD WITH ANYBODY THAT WANTED IT AND IT WAS OWING TO THIS VERY TRAIT THAT HIS FAMILY SPENT THEIR DAYS IN POVERTY AND AT TIMES WERE PINCHED WITH FAMINE
PHIL APPEARS TO HAVE A WEAKNESS FOR SEMINARIES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR YOUR FRIEND SELLERS RETORTED PHILIP IF HE HAD HAD A WEAKNESS FOR DISTRICT SCHOOLS
THIS IS NOT RIGHT I WILL DISCHARGE THE MEN AND GO AT SOME HONEST WORK
IT IS BELIEVED THEY WILL DESERT THE EXECRABLE BILL MONDAY
ALL EYES WERE TURNED INQUIRINGLY UPON HIM
PHILIP HAD ENJOYED HIS WINTER VERY WELL FOR A MAN WITH HIS ARM BROKEN AND HIS HEAD SMASHED
H'WSH
AND NOW OCCURRED ONE OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL INCIDENTS WHICH NO FICTION-WRITER WOULD DARE TO IMAGINE A SCENE OF TOUCHING PATHOS CREDITABLE TO OUR FALLEN HUMANITY
THE ONLY PERSON IN HAWKEYE WHO UNDERSTANDS ME BUT YOU REFUSE TO UNDERSTAND ME REPLIED HARRY FLATTERED BUT STILL PETULANT
MY MOTHER--MY OTHER MOTHER THAT'S GONE AWAY--SHE ALWAYS TOLD ME TO WORK ALONG AND NOT BE MUCH EXPECTING TO GET RICH AND THEN I WOULDN'T BE DISAPPOINTED IF I DIDN'T GET RICH
AND WHEN IT WAS FINISHED HIS HEAD FELL HELPLESSLY FORWARD ON HIS ARMS
HAWKINS CAME SLOWLY BACK WATCHING WISTFULLY BUT HOPELESSLY FOR THE STRANGER AND LOWERING HIS PRICE STEADILY WITH HIS SINKING HEART
THE WRECK LODGED UPON A SANDBAR AND WHEN THE BOREAS TURNED THE NEXT POINT ON HER UPWARD JOURNEY IT WAS STILL BURNING WITH SCARCELY ABATED FURY
AFTER SHE HAD FIRED TWICE AT COL
THIS REJECTED RIVAL TO CAUSE THE EXPLOSION
SELBY VISITS LAURA AND EFFECTS A RECONCILIATION CHAPTER XL COL
THE COMMITTEE MADE ITS REPORT TO THE SENATE AND THAT BODY PROCEEDED TO CONSIDER ITS ACCEPTANCE
A WASHINGTON BOARDING HOUSE HAD THE ODOR OF A BOARDING HOUSE THE WORLD OVER
NOT GUILTY SHE SAT DOWN AND THE COURT PROCEEDED TO IMPANEL A JURY
LARRY O'TOOLE CONTRACTOR
I HAVE NO PITY FOR HIM NOT THE LEAST
NO ONE SHALL SEE IT
ALL READY SAID JIM UNDER HIS BREATH
I'LL FIX THAT
SHE THRUST THE LETTERS ASIDE ROSE UP AND WENT AND STOOD AT THE WINDOW
REJOICE WITH ME FOR THE LONG AGONY IS OVER
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN THE PRISONER TWO YEARS SIR
BESIDES HE FELT THAT HE COULD DO THE COUNTRY MORE GOOD BY REMAINING AT HOME
THE SHIVERING OF THE BOAT UNDER THE BEATING OF THE WHEELS WAS SHEER MISERY TO THEM
WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY FAITH IN THAT HILL BUT WE HAVE A RESPECT FOR A MAN THAT'S GOT THE PLUCK THAT YOU'VE SHOWED
I AM AFRAID WE CANNOT COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING MISS HAWKINS NO I AM AFRAID NOT--IF YOU HAVE RESUMED YOUR PRINCIPLES MR TROLLOP DID YOU SEND FOR ME MERELY TO INSULT ME
AND HE GOT HIS EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AND TRIED TO FORCE IT UPON THE COLONEL--PLEADED WITH HIM TO TAKE IT--IMPLORED HIM TO DO IT
FOR A WOMAN WILL NEVER DO AGAIN WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE
NOW YOU WRENCH YOUR GAZE LOOSE AND YOU LOOK DOWN IN FRONT OF YOU AND SEE THE BROAD PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE STRETCHING STRAIGHT AHEAD FOR A MILE OR MORE TILL IT BRINGS UP AGAINST THE IRON FENCE IN FRONT OF A PILLARED GRANITE PILE THE TREASURY BUILDING-AN EDIFICE THAT WOULD COMMAND RESPECT IN ANY CAPITAL
NO THEY'LL BE BETTER OFF
HOW IT WAS DONE GETS ME
THAT'S GOOD--GLAD TO HEAR THAT
SENATOR DILWORTHY'S REMAINS HAVE DEMANDED AN INVESTIGATION
IT CARRIES THE USUAL COW-CATCHER IN FRONT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE BUT THIS IS MERE OSTENTATION
HER SISTERS HAD GONE TO THE CITY TO SHOW SOME COUNTRY VISITORS INDEPENDENCE HALL GIRARD COLLEGE AND FAIRMOUNT WATER WORKS AND PARK FOUR OBJECTS WHICH AMERICANS CANNOT DIE PEACEFULLY EVEN IN NAPLES WITHOUT HAVING SEEN
THEN MARSHES
TO LOUISE HE WROTE
IT'S IN THE ROUGH YET IN THE ROUGH
LET US BE FRANK
WE HOLD IT SAFEST TO ELECT OUR JUDGES AND EVERYBODY ELSE
MY GOD SHE CRIED THIS WILL NEVER DO
WHEN THE BOYS CAME DOWN INTO THE MAIN SALOON OF THE BOREAS THEY SAW A PITIFUL SIGHT AND HEARD A WORLD OF PITIFUL SOUNDS
NOW ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO HOLD THIS LAND AND KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY IS TO PAY THE TRIFLING TAXES ON IT YEARLY--FIVE OR TEN DOLLARS--THE WHOLE TRACT WOULD NOT SELL FOR OVER A THIRD OF A CENT AN ACRE NOW BUT SOME DAY PEOPLE WILL BE GLAD TO GET IT FOR TWENTY DOLLARS FIFTY DOLLARS A HUNDRED DOLLARS AN ACRE
HOW WAS HE GETTING ON WITH HIS NAVIGATION SCHEME WOULD IT BE LIKELY TO TAKE HIM FROM HOME TO JEFFERSON CITY
WASHINGTON WAS UNABLE TO SAY ANYTHING
FRANCOIS TUMBLED FROM THE SKY LIGHT--IN THE SECOND-STORY HALL CLEAN DOWN TO THE FIRST FLOOR EVERYBODY--"MERCY MRS O.--"YES INDEED--AND BROKE TWO OF HIS RIBS EVERYBODY--"WHAT MRS O
A GENTLEMAN IN BLACK BROADCLOTH WITH SANDY HAIR INCLINED TO CURL A ROUND REDDISH AND RATHER JOVIAL FACE SHARP RATHER THAN INTELLECTUAL AND WITH A SELF-SUFFICIENT AIR
EXCUSE MY BLUNTNESS HE CONTINUED BUT WOULD THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS LOVE
FLY AND THEY DID FLY
SELLERS SAID
IT PUZZLED HIM NOT A LITTLE THAT ALL HIS FASCINATIONS SEEMED TO GO FOR SO LITTLE WITH LAURA
SH!--KEEP MUM BUT JUST YOU CONFINE YOURSELF TO THAT DIET AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
MARGARET AGREED WITH HER DAUGHTER AND THOUGH SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO SUCH PEOPLE SHE WAS GRATEFUL TO RUTH FOR STICKING AT LEAST ONE PIN INTO HIM
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE CONTRIVING--BUT IT SEEMS TO ENTERTAIN YOU--SO PLEASE GO ON I WILL I ASSURE YOU
WHATEVER BECOME OF IT WHY THE--MATTER IS SIMPLE ENOUGH
THAT WILL DO THE DEFENCE DECLINED TO EXAMINE MR HAWKINS AT PRESENT
HE SEEMED SERIOUSLY PERPLEXED
HE WAS LIKE ADAM
THE WORLD WAS ALL NEW AND FRESH TO RUTH AS IF IT HAD JUST BEEN CREATED FOR HER AND LOVE FILLED IT TILL HER HEART WAS OVERFLOWING WITH HAPPINESS
IF MR BOLTON HAD BEEN ON HIS WAY TO MARKET TO BUY A DINNER FOR HIS FAMILY WITH THE ONLY DOLLAR HE HAD IN THE WORLD IN HIS POCKET HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO A CHANCE BEGGAR WHO ASKED HIM FOR IT
AND IT WOULD BE SWEET FOR A WOMAN TO REMEMBER IN AFTER YEARS THAT SHE HAD KISSED BRAHAM
THE NEIGHBORS SUPPOSED THAT THE ENGAGEMENT WITH COL
IT NEVER ENTERED MY HEAD
NOT THAT HE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT NEWSPAPER WORK OR HAD THE LEAST IDEA OF JOURNALISM
HARRY HAD BEEN CONSTITUTED ENGINEER-IN-GENERAL AND HE THREW THE FULL STRENGTH OF HIS POWERS INTO HIS WORK
TRY ME MRS HAWKINS WAS OUT OF THE ROOM IN A MOMENT
NO THIS IS USELESS THIS IS ABSURD
SHE'S BEN SICK THREE WEEKS
THE DOOR OPENED AND THE COLONEL ENTERED STANDING IN THE FULL LIGHT OF THE OPPOSITE WINDOW
AND WITH ALL HER FREEDOM IN SPEAKING OF HER OWN HOPES PHILIP COULD NOT DETECT ANY REFERENCE TO HIMSELF IN THEM
HADN'T SKEINS OF THREAD ENOUGH TO REPRESENT THEM ALL--BUT YOU GET AN IDEA--PERFECT TRESTLE-WORK OF BRIDGES FOR SEVENTY TWO MILES
LAURA IS ADOPTED INTO THE HAWKINS FAMILY
BUT WHAT IF HE DID
THEN WHAT SUGGESTED IT TO YOU TO VOLUNTEER THAT REMARK THEY'VE ALWAYS ASKED THAT WHEN I WAS ON JURIES ALL RIGHT THEN
PERHAPS THE READER HAS NEVER BEEN THERE
SELLERS WAS AS UNCHANGED AS ANY ONE PHILIP SAW WHOM HE HAD KNOWN ELSEWHERE
AND DOES IT SEEM AS NECESSARY TO YOU TO DO IT AS IT DID BEFORE YOU CAME TO FALLKILL IT WAS A HOME QUESTION AND WENT DEEPER THAN PHILIP KNEW FOR RUTH AT ONCE THOUGHT OF PRACTICING HER PROFESSION AMONG THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF HER ACQUAINTANCE IN THE VILLAGE
A SHRIEK AT INTERVALS TOLD OF A CAPTIVE THAT HAD MET HIS DOOM
THAT'S ALL
WHY YOU MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO SLEEP IN A THUNDER-FACTORY
WELL WELL WELL LET ME LOOK AT YOU AGAIN
TRYING TO MAKE OUR FORTUNE IN KENTUCKY HE CRIPPLED US AGAIN AND WE HAD TO MOVE HERE
IF HE WOULD SIMPLY VOTE NO BUT KEEP QUIET AND NOT MOLEST US I WOULD FEEL PERFECTLY CHEERFUL AND CONTENT
HE FOUND A CHANGE IN THAT QUARTER WHICH WAS DISTRESSING
ALL MEN WILL ENDORSE THAT LAURA LOOKED PLEASED AND SAID
I DO LIKE WASHINGTON--I LIKE IT EVER SO MUCH NO BUT I WAS GOING TO ASK YES I AM COMING TO IT COMING TO IT AS FAST AS I CAN
AND SOME BOOKS AND WRITING MATERIALS IF IT WAS ALLOWED
I WILL CALL ALICE IF THEE HAS ANY DYING CONFESSIONS TO MAKE AS PHILIP CONVALESCED ALICE MORE AND MORE TOOK RUTH'S PLACE AS HIS ENTERTAINER AND READ TO HIM BY THE HOUR WHEN HE DID NOT WANT TO TALK--TO TALK ABOUT RUTH AS HE DID A GOOD DEAL OF THE TIME
THEY LACK VIM THEY LACK VENOM
WHILE HE WAS WITH HER SHE MADE HIM FORGET THAT THE HAWKINS HOUSE WAS NOTHING BUT A WOODEN TENEMENT WITH FOUR SMALL SQUARE ROOMS ON THE GROUND FLOOR AND A HALF STORY
ONE FEMALE LOBBYIST $10,000
THAT THE MURDER WAS IN COLD BLOOD DELIBERATE AND WITHOUT PROVOCATION
IT WOULD COMBINE THE ADVANTAGES OF ZURICH FREIBURG CREUZOT AND THE SHEFFIELD SCIENTIFIC
IT MUST WAIT FOR THE NEXT SESSION
IS IT A CONCERT OR A GILDED OPERA
IS HILDEBRAND ABOUT AGAIN MRS GASHLY MRS G.--"YES BUT THAT'S ABOUT ALL
THE WASHINGTON RAILWAY CONDUCTOR TESTIFIED THAT THE PRISONER HAD ASKED HIM IF A GENTLEMAN AND HIS FAMILY WENT OUT ON THE EVENING TRAIN DESCRIBING THE PERSONS HE HAD SINCE LEARNED WERE COL
AND HE HEARD HER MURMUR DEAR PHIL THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO WATCH AND WAIT FOR THE CRUEL FEVER TO BURN ITSELF OUT
ONE OF THE PERSONS PRESENT IN THE PARLOR SAYS THAT AFTER LAURA HAWKINS HAD FIRED TWICE SHE TURNED THE PISTOL TOWARDS HERSELF BUT THAT BRIERLY SPRUNG AND CAUGHT IT FROM HER HAND AND THAT IT WAS HE WHO THREW IT ON THE FLOOR
HE FELT NOW THAT HE MUST TEMPORIZE THAT HE MUST GAIN TIME
AND WHERE TO BEGIN
TOO BUSY TO LOOK INTO IT
THEN SHE ASKED THE CLERK FOR THE AUTOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST TABLE--AND WAS PAINED TO SEE THE ADMIRATION HER BEAUTY HAD INSPIRED IN HIM FADE OUT OF HIS FACE
AND THE MOST ANNOYING THOUGHT IS THAT A LITTLE MONEY JUDICIOUSLY APPLIED WOULD RELIEVE THE BURDENS AND ANXIETIES OF MOST OF THESE PEOPLE
HE WAS FULL OF FOREBODING
AS IN THE STUPOR OF A SUDDEN CALAMITY AND NOT FULLY COMPREHENDING IT MRS HAWKINS SAW LAURA LED AWAY BY THE OFFICER
SHE WAS HAPPY
HE OFTEN SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING STRIKING ABOUT THE OCEAN
THAT SHE HAD DONE THIS THE PUBLIC READ IN THE JOURNALS OF THE DAY AND THE SIMPLE ANNOUNCEMENT CAST A SOFTENING LIGHT UPON HER CHARACTER
I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR TELLING ME OF THAT ODIOUS MAN AND SHE ROSE FROM HER CHAIR AND GAVE HIM HER PRETTY HAND WHICH THE SILLY FELLOW TOOK AND KISSED AND CLUNG TO
SELLERS AND HERSELF HAD KEPT SO LONG AND SO FAITHFULLY
SUPPOSE I LOVED YOU YET
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF HARRY'S LETTER TO THE COLONEL THE INFORMATION IT CONVEYED WAS CONDENSED OR EXPANDED ONE OR THE OTHER FROM THE FOLLOWING EPISODE OF HIS VISIT TO NEW YORK
THE PRESIDENT SAID
HE WAS ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OLD DIGNIFIED WELL PRESERVED AND WELL DRESSED
WHEN YOU WENT TO BED IT WAS RAINING
THAT HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND WENT STRAIGHT TO CERTAIN LEGISLATORS TOLD THEM EVERYTHING MADE THEM COUNT THE MONEY AND ALSO TOLD THEM OF THE EXPOSURE HE WOULD MAKE IN JOINT CONVENTION
IT WAS GROWING RATHER DARK IN THE HOUSE AND THE EVENING AIR WAS CHILLY TOO
THE LADIES ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM IN FULL CHARACTER
DO NOT BE OFFISH AND UNSOCIABLE
HOW DISTANT RUTH WAS NOW FROM HIM NOW WHEN SHE MIGHT NEED HIM MOST
NOBLE SAID HE COULD NOT THINK $10,000 TOO LITTLE
A COMFORTABLE LOOKING PLACE WITH PLENTY OF OUTLINE MAPS HANGING ABOUT THE WALLS AND IN THE WINDOWS AND A SPECTACLED MAN WAS MARKING OUT ANOTHER ONE ON A LONG TABLE
WHEN THE BOREAS BACKED AWAY FROM THE LAND TO CONTINUE HER VOYAGE UP THE RIVER THE HAWKINSES WERE RICHER BY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF HUMAN SUFFERING AND IN LEARNING THROUGH HONEST HARD WORK HOW TO RELIEVE IT
NOW SHE WAS DAZZLING IN THE FULLNESS OF RIPE WOMANHOOD A SUPERB CREATURE WITH ALL THE FASCINATION THAT A WOMAN OF THE WORLD HAS FOR SUCH A MAN AS COL
SHE CONSTITUTED HIM CHIEF CHAMPION OF THE KNOBS UNIVERSITY BILL AND HE ACCEPTED THE POSITION AT FIRST RELUCTANTLY BUT LATER AS A VALUED MEANS OF SERVING HER--HE EVEN CAME TO LOOK UPON IT AS A PIECE OF GREAT GOOD FORTUNE SINCE IT BROUGHT HIM INTO SUCH FREQUENT CONTACT WITH HER
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
AND YET WHEN YOU COME TO LOOK AT IT YOU CANNOT DENY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT THE SERVICES OF SOME OF OUR ABLEST MEN SIR IF THE COUNTRY WERE OPPOSED TO--TO--BRIBERY
BUT THEE MAY AS WELL TAKE CARE OF THEESELF RUTH AND NOT GO DAWDLING ALONG WITH A YOUNG MAN IN HIS ADVENTURES UNTIL THY OWN MIND IS A LITTLE MORE SETTLED WHAT THEE WANTS THIS EXCELLENT ADVICE DID NOT SEEM TO IMPRESS RUTH GREATLY FOR SHE WAS LOOKING AWAY WITH THAT ABSTRACTION OF VISION WHICH OFTEN CAME INTO HER GREY EYES AND AT LENGTH SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A SORT OF IMPATIENCE I WISH I COULD GO WEST OR SOUTH OR SOMEWHERE
THE MOMENTOUS DAY WAS AT HAND--A DAY THAT PROMISED TO MAKE OR MAR THE FORTUNES OF HAWKINS FAMILY FOR ALL TIME
THEY TRAVELED IN A SLEEPING CAR
44.  "NOT THAT 45.  RUTH'S MOTHER MAKES ENQUIRIES 46.  THE LETTER 47.  CARING FOR THE POOR 48.  ANATOMICAL INVESTIGATIONS 49.  RUTH LOOKING AT THE NEW ONE BY CANDLE LIGHT 60.  "ONLY FOR YOU BRIERLY 51.  AN ACCLIMATED MAN 51.  NO THANKS
SELLERS WAS OF COURSE A PROMINENT MAN DURING THE WAR
MRS PATRIQUE OREILLE PRONOUNCED O-RELAY MISS BRIDGET PRONOUNCED BREEZHAY OREILLE MRS PETER GASHLY MISS GASHLY AND MISS EMMELINE GASHLY
IT WAS AT NEWPORT AND WE WOULDN'T TRUST HIRED NURSES
ALL EYES FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION OF THE SPEAKER'S AND THEN THERE WAS A GENERAL TITTER
THE GOLD IN HIS FINGER RING WAS WORTH FORTY FIVE DOLLARS
HERE IS THE DEEPO THE CHURCH THE CITY HALL AND SO ON AH I SEE
CHAPTER XLVIII
HE DECLARED THAT WOMEN WERE ALWAYS READY TO DROP ANY MAN FOR HIGHER GAME
HER MEMORY FOUND BUT ONE RESTING PLACE
SHE SAID THERE COULD BE NO LOVE WITHOUT RESPECT AND SHE WOULD ONLY DESPISE A MAN WHO COULD CONTENT HIMSELF WITH A THING LIKE HER
HE WOULD TEAR HERS NOW AND LET HER SEE HOW IT FELT
THE BOSWELLS WERE TOUCHED BY THE YOUTH'S SORROW AND EVEN THE GENERAL UNBENT AND SAID ENCOURAGING THINGS TO HIM.--THERE WAS BALM IN THIS
IT IS A TIME WHEN ONE IS FILLED WITH VAGUE LONGINGS
IT WAS KEEN DELIGHT TO LAURA TO PROVE THAT SHE HAD POWER OVER MEN
THE QUALITY OF HER LITERARY TASTES HAD NECESSARILY UNDERGONE CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT UNDER THIS REGIMEN AND AS NECESSARILY ALSO THE DUALITY OF HER LANGUAGE HAD IMPROVED THOUGH IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT NOW AND THEN HER FORMER CONDITION OF LIFE BETRAYED ITSELF IN JUST PERCEPTIBLE INELEGANCIES OF EXPRESSION AND LAPSES OF GRAMMAR
NOBODY DRESSED MORE LIKE AN ENGINEER THAN MR HENRY BRIERLY
THE PURPOSE EVIDENTLY IS TO OPEN THE DOOR TO A MASS OF IRRELEVANT TESTIMONY THE OBJECT OF WHICH IS TO PRODUCE AN EFFECT UPON THE JURY YOUR HONOR WELL UNDERSTANDS PERHAPS SUGGESTED THE JUDGE THE COURT OUGHT TO HEAR THE TESTIMONY AND EXCLUDE IT AFTERWARDS IF IT IS IRRELEVANT WILL YOUR HONOR HEAR ARGUMENT ON THAT CERTAINLY AND ARGUMENT HIS HONOR DID HEAR OR PRETEND TO FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS FROM ALL THE COUNSEL IN TURN IN THE COURSE OF WHICH THE LAWYERS READ CONTRADICTORY DECISIONS ENOUGH TO PERFECTLY ESTABLISH BOTH SIDES FROM VOLUME AFTER VOLUME WHOLE LIBRARIES IN FACT UNTIL NO MORTAL MAN COULD SAY WHAT THE RULES WERE
THITHER SHE WENT IN SEPTEMBER AND BEGAN FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THE YEAR A LIFE NEW TO HER
EVEN PHILIP HIMSELF WOULD FEEL THE GOOD EFFECTS OF IT
I'LL ADVANCE THE MONEY FOR THE PAYMENTS AND YOU CAN SELL THE LOTS
A SWARM OF MEN WERE HARD AT WORK AND THE DULL AIR WAS FILLED WITH THE CHEERY MUSIC OF LABOR
SAID THE COLONEL
I SHOULD LIKE TO RUN THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT ABOUT SIX MONTHS
WHAT CAPACITIES SHE HAS OF PURITY TENDERNESS GOODNESS
THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME BUTTERFLY OR ANOTHER FLITTING ABOUT AND WHEN PHILIP SHOWED BY HIS MANNER THAT HE WAS NOT PLEASED RUTH LAUGHED MERRILY ENOUGH AND RALLIED HIM ON HIS SOBERNESS--SHE DECLARED HE WAS GETTING TO BE GRIM AND UNSOCIAL
I'LL SHOW YOU ABOUT THAT
YOU'LL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE CONTRACTORS ABOUT THE RAILS SIR SAID JEFF
YES I AM PERFECTLY SURE HE WILL VOTE RIGHT NOW THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GOOD SAID THE SENATOR
WE CONTEMPLATE FOR THE MOST PART YOUNG MEN WHO DON'T CARE FOR ANYTHING THEY OUGHT TO CARE FOR WELL SAID PHILIP LOOKING HUMBLE I CARE FOR SOME THINGS YOU AND RUTH FOR INSTANCE
SHE NOTICED WITH SECRET PLEASURE THE LITTLE START OF ADMIRATION THAT ALWAYS MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THE FACES OF THE GUESTS WHEN SHE ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM ARRAYED IN EVENING COSTUME
NOW HE BEGAN TO ASSIST HER IN MAKING A SELECTION
THE SECOND MONTH CLOSED WITH A RIOT.--SELLERS WAS ABSENT AT THE TIME AND HARRY BEGAN AN ACTIVE ABSENCE HIMSELF WITH THE MOB AT HIS HEELS
NO INDEEDY DO YOU RECKON HE SAW US UNCLE DAN'L
THERE WAS ALSO AN INTERVIEW WITH COL
IT WAS LONG BEFORE HER FACULTIES WERE WHOLLY RESTORED AND THEN SHE FOUND HERSELF LYING ON THE FLOOR BY A SOFA IN HER OWN SITTING-ROOM AND ALONE
IT GREW AND GREW IT BECAME MORE AND MORE INSUPPORTABLE
IF THE PEOPLE OF NAPOLEON WANT ME TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND LOOK AFTER THAT MATTER I MIGHT TEAR MYSELF FROM MY HOME
OH IT IS BOUND TO BE FOUND OUT--NOTHING CAN PREVENT IT--NOTHING THEN HE THREW HIMSELF INTO HIS CHAIR AND SAID
ITS LABORERS WERE ALMOST ALTOGETHER UNSKILLED
I'LL TALK AS SWEETLY TO HIM AS IF HE WERE MY OWN CHILD
IL VEUT FAIRE SECHER DE LA NEIGE AU FOUR ET LA VENDRE POUR DU SEL BLANC
THE ATTITUDINIZING TENOR WITH HIS LANGUISHING OH SUMMER NIGHT THE SOPRANO WITH HER BATTI BATTI WHO WARBLES AND TRILLS AND RUNS AND FETCHES HER BREATH AND ENDS WITH A NOBLE SCREAM THAT BRINGS DOWN A TEMPEST OF APPLAUSE IN THE MIDST OF WHICH SHE BACKS OFF THE STAGE SMILING AND BOWING
HE WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS ABOUT IT EVEN TO PHILIP
HE FLEW HITHER AND THITHER MAKING CONTRACTS ENGAGING MEN AND STEEPING HIS SOUL IN THE ECSTASIES OF BUSINESS
THERE WAS NOT A MOVEMENT IN THE HOUSE
GENTLEMEN CALLED OUT THE CHIEF ENGINEER FROM THE TABLE
AFTER SHE HAD ASKED THE CONDUCTOR SEVERAL QUESTIONS HE HEARD HER SAY HE CAN'T ESCAPE WITNESS ASKED HER WHO AND SHE REPLIED NOBODY DID NOT SEE HER DURING THE NIGHT
TOWARDS SUNSET OF THE THIRD DAY WHEN THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN THOUGHT THEY OUGHT TO BE NEAR THE TOWN OF MAGNOLIA NEAR WHICH THEY HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO FIND THE ENGINEERS CAMP THEY DESCRIED A LOG HOUSE AND DREW UP BEFORE IT TO ENQUIRE THE WAY
THE COLONEL'S TONGUE WAS A MAGICIAN'S WAND THAT TURNED DRIED APPLES INTO FIGS AND WATER INTO WINE AS EASILY AS IT COULD CHANGE A HOVEL INTO A PALACE AND PRESENT POVERTY INTO IMMINENT FUTURE RICHES
TO BE SURE I ONLY CARE ABOUT IT FOR THE BOY HE SAID
MR BOLTON SPENT A VERY PLEASANT DAY IN HIS OFFICE AND WENT HOME REVOLVING SOME NEW PLANS AND THE EXECUTION OF SOME PROJECTS HE HAD LONG BEEN PREVENTED FROM ENTERING UPON BY THE LACK OF MONEY
SENATOR DILWORTHY HAD BECOME WELL CONVINCED BY THIS TIME THAT HIS JUDGMENT OF THE COUNTRY-BRED MISSOURI GIRL HAD NOT DECEIVED HIM--IT WAS PLAIN THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE A PEERLESS MISSIONARY IN THE FIELD OF LABOR HE DESIGNED HER FOR AND THEREFORE IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY SAFE AND LIKEWISE JUDICIOUS TO SEND HER FORTH WELL PANOPLIED FOR HER WORK.--SO HE HAD ADDED NEW AND STILL RICHER COSTUMES TO HER WARDROBE AND ASSISTED THEIR ATTRACTIONS WITH COSTLY JEWELRY--LOANS ON THE FUTURE LAND SALE
THE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN OCCUPIED TEN OF THE FRONT BENCHES DRESSED IN THEIR BEST AND MOST UNCOMFORTABLE CLOTHES AND WITH HAIR COMBED AND FACES TOO CLEAN TO FEEL NATURAL
THEY RELATED AS THE READER KNOWS TO LAURA'S FATHER

RUTH'S COURSE WAS VINDICATED NOW AND IT CERTAINLY DID NOT BECOME PHILIP WHO HAD NOTHING TO OFFER BUT A FUTURE CHANCE AGAINST THE VISIBLE RESULT OF HER DETERMINATION AND INDUSTRY TO OPEN AN ARGUMENT WITH HER
HE HAD KEPT OFF ALL THOSE HE DID NOT KNOW
SHE DEFERRED TO HIS OPINIONS AND LISTENED ATTENTIVELY WHEN HE TALKED AND IN TIME MET HIS FRANK MANNER WITH AN EQUAL FRANKNESS SO THAT HE WAS QUITE CONVINCED THAT WHATEVER SHE MIGHT FEEL TOWARDS HARRY SHE WAS SINCERE WITH HIM
BUT SHE WAS RELUCTANT TO ADMIT TO HERSELF THAT HER NOTIONS OF A CAREER HAD UNDERGONE ANY CHANGE
WHEN HE WAS WORTHY OF IT AND WHEN HE COULD OFFER HER SOMETHING BETTER THAN A PARTNERSHIP IN HIS POVERTY
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL FROM WASHINGTON COL
HE HAD GONE OUT WITH A HAND-BAG BEFORE SIX O'CLOCK YESTERDAY SAYING THAT HE HAD TO GO TO NEW YORK BUT SHOULD RETURN NEXT DAY
IT'S THE AMARANTH SURE HE BENT OVER A SPEAKING TUBE AND SAID
THE QUESTION OF INSANITY IN ALL ITS LEGAL ASPECTS WAS OF COURSE DRAWN INTO THE DISCUSSION AND ITS APPLICATION AFFIRMED AND DENIED
LAURA'S CHARACTER AS A LOBBYIST IN WASHINGTON WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO APPEAR INCIDENTALLY IN THE EVIDENCE WAS ALSO AGAINST HER
WHEN THE WINDOW WAS OPENED THERE WAS NOTHING TO PREVENT THE RAIN COMING IN
HE WAS ALWAYS DELICATE--ESPECIALLY HIS LUNGS--AND THIS ODIOUS CLIMATE TELLS ON HIM STRONG NOW AFTER PARRY WHICH IS SO MILD MRS H:--"I SHOULD THINK SO
WHEN HE ARRIVED ON THE GROUND HE FOUND HIS FRIENDS UNTERRIFIED
HE FELT THAT TOO MUCH OR NOT ENOUGH WAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED
SUCH A MAN AS PHILIP HAS ONLY ONE STANDARD BY WHICH TO JUDGE WOMEN
AND SOMETIMES I THINK I'LL HAVE EVER SO MANY BOOKS
HE HAD MADE AN ABLE FIGHT BRIEF AS IT WAS AND THAT AT LEAST WAS TO HIS CREDIT
YOU HEAR ME
SELLERS KNOWS EVERYBODY FROM MISSOURI AND FROM THE WEST TOO FOR THAT MATTER
I KNEW YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE TO SHOW HIM THAT IT WAS JUST AND PURE IN ORDER TO SECURE HIS CORDIAL SUPPORT I THINK I CONVINCED HIM
THEN UPON THE NEXT SMALLEST SUM
PRESENTLY HE HEARD THE SOUND OF A PICK OR A DRILL AND WONDERED WHAT IT MEANT
HE COULD ONLY REMEMBER STARTING UP THE RIVER WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILD AND HE HAD AN IDEA THAT THERE WAS A RACE BUT HE WAS NOT CERTAIN
THE PROSECUTION THEN PUT UPON THE STAND THE OTHER WITNESSES OF THE SHOOTING AT THE HOTEL AND THE CLERK AND THE ATTENDING PHYSICIANS
THE RECENT WEARING DAYS AND NIGHTS OF WATCHING AND THE WASTING GRIEF THAT HAD POSSESSED HER COMBINED WITH THE PROFOUND DEPRESSION THAT NATURALLY CAME WITH THE REACTION OF IDLENESS MADE LAURA PECULIARLY SUSCEPTIBLE AT THIS TIME TO ROMANTIC IMPRESSIONS
AND THEN SHE PRAYED THAT HER FATHER IN HEAVEN WOULD GIVE HER STRENGTH
ENTERING THE HOUSE THE SENATOR CALLED A SERVANT AND SAID TELL MISS LAURA THAT WE ARE WAITING TO SEE HER
IT WAS A PERIOD OF SUDDEN PANIC AND NO MONEY
MIGHT HE WRITE TO HER OFTEN AND TELL HER OF HIS LIFE
HE WAS GLAD IT WAS A REAL ESTATE OFFICE--HE WAS A MADE MAN NOW SURE
HE HELD MANY CONSULTATIONS WITH HIS MOTHER UPON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE FAMILY AND TALKED ONCE WITH HIS FATHER UPON THE SAME SUBJECT BUT ONLY ONCE
THE HAWKINS BLOOD IS GOOD BLOOD ALL THE WAY FROM TENNESSEE
EVERY WEEK WE CAN GAIN SAID THE LEARNED COUNSEL BRAHAM IMPROVES OUR CHANCES
MR BUCKSTONE BEGAN TO THINK IT MIGHT BE SAFE NOW TO PROCEED TO BUSINESS HE CONSULTED WITH TROLLOP AND ONE OR TWO OTHERS
HER FACE WAS QUITE SOBER
PHILIP USED TO COME TO FALLKILL OFTEN WHILE HE WAS IN COLLEGE
TRUE ART AND ANY ATTENTION TO DRAMATIC PROPRIETIES REQUIRED IT
IT WAS TRUE THAT HE NEVER SEEMED TO HAVE READY MONEY BUT HE WAS ENGAGED IN VERY LARGE OPERATIONS
JUST AS SURE AS I'M ALIVE THIS MOMENT THERE'S SOMETHING TREMENDOUS STIRRING IN IRON SPECULATION HERE HAWKINS GOT UP AND BEGAN TO PACE THE FLOOR WITH EXCITED EYES AND WITH GESTURING HANDS]--"SOMETHING ENORMOUS GOING ON IN IRON WITHOUT THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT AND HERE I SIT MOUSING IN THE DARK AND NEVER KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT
BUT EVERYTHING IS WELL NOW--WE ARE DONE WITH POVERTY SAD TOIL WEARINESS AND HEART-BREAK
EMILY WAS FAIR AND PRETTY GIRLISH AND DIFFIDENT--BLUE EYES AND LIGHT HAIR
SHE WAVED HIM AWAY AND SAID
THE FACTS REPORTED WERE SCRUTINIZED THE STANDING OF THE PARTIES WAS DISCUSSED THE DOZEN DIFFERENT THEORIES OF THE MOTIVE BROACHED IN THE NEWSPAPERS WERE DISPUTED OVER
BUT DON'T THROW AWAY THOSE THINGS--THEY ARE SO SPLENDID AND I CAN SEE HOW SURE THEY ARE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HIS TALENTS HAD A FAIR FIELD
IT COULD NOT BE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
THE SOMBRE RIVER JUST PERCEPTIBLY BRIGHTENED UNDER THE VEILED LIGHT
THE FACT WAS THE POOR FELLOW HUNG AROUND THERE DAY AFTER DAY FOR THE CHANCE OF SEEING LAURA FOR FIVE MINUTES AT A TIME
SELLERS WAS AT THE LANDING TO BID THEM GOOD-BYE
IN FIVE YEARS THE INCREASE IN LOCAL WEALTH WOULD NOT ONLY REIMBURSE THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE OUTLAY IN THIS APPROPRIATION BUT POUR UNTOLD WEALTH INTO THE TREASURY
TO THIS WAS APPENDED A MAP OF THE CITY AND A SURVEY OF THE RIVER
FRIENDS I AM NOT VERY WELL PROVIDED FOR MYSELF BUT STILL I WOULD NOT TURN MY BACK ON A HOMELESS ORPHAN
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE WORK OF AN AUTHOR OF TALENT AND IMAGINATION AND IT SURELY WAS NOT HIS FAULT IF THE DINNER ITSELF WAS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT A DELUSION AND IF THE GUESTS GOT SOMETHING THAT TASTED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME WHATEVER DISH THEY ORDERED
WHAT THE SOUTH NEEDED CONTINUED MR BUCKSTONE WAS SKILLED LABOR
AN EXPERIMENTAL INSTITUTION IS IN CONTEMPLATION IN TENNESSEE WHICH WILL DO FOR THAT STATE WHAT THE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL AT ZURICH DID FOR SWITZERLAND
HE IS A MOTH SINGED THAT IS ALL--THE TRIFLER WITH WOMEN THOUGHT HE WAS A WASP
IT WAS TO RUTH BOLTON THAT PHILIP WROTE LAST
FOREIGNERS WHO READ THIS SAD STORY WILL BE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND ANY OTHER TERMINATION OF IT
NEXT DAY EVERYBODY WAS AT THE VILLAGE CHURCH A FULL HALF HOUR BEFORE TIME FOR SUNDAY SCHOOL TO OPEN
I'M ANGRY WITH THE CRUEL WORLD WHICH PURSUES AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN AS IT NEVER DOES A MAN
THERE'S HEAPS OF MONEY IN IT
I HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY PUNISHED FOR MY THOUGHTLESSNESS
THEY ARE ALL OLD HANDS AT THIS BUSINESS COME HARRY LET'S GO UP AND LOOK AT IT JUST FOR THE COMFORT OF IT SAID PHILIP
I'LL COME OVER FROM HAWKEYE
GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO BUILD IT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET THE COLONEL OFF FROM THESE LARGE THEMES WHEN HE WAS ONCE STARTED BUT PHILIP BROUGHT THE CONVERSATION ROUND TO LAURA AND HER REPUTATION IN THE CITY
I NEVER SAW SUCH A TIGHT TIME FOR MONEY IN HARRISBURG WERE THERE NO COMBINATIONS NO RAILROAD JOBS NO MINING SCHEMES PUT THROUGH IN CONNECTION WITH THE ELECTION
THE PROMINENT FEATURES YOU SOON LOCATE AND GET FAMILIAR WITH
DELIGHTFUL ILLUSION OF PAINT AND TINSEL AND SILK ATTIRE OF CHEAP SENTIMENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY DIALOGUE
HE STARTED A BANK ACCOUNT IN A SMALL WAY--AND MENTIONED THE DEPOSIT CASUALLY TO FRIENDS
THE COLUMBUS RIVER NAVIGATION SCHEME ABSORBED ONLY A PART OF HIS TIME SO HE WAS ENABLED TO THROW QUITE A STRONG RESERVE FORCE OF ENERGY INTO THE TENNESSEE LAND PLAN A VAST ENTERPRISE COMMENSURATE WITH HIS ABILITIES AND IN THE PROSECUTION OF WHICH HE WAS GREATLY AIDED BY MR HENRY BRIERLY WHO WAS BUZZING ABOUT THE CAPITOL AND THE HOTELS DAY AND NIGHT AND MAKING CAPITAL FOR IT IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY
SHE IS BENT ON CAPTURING ME THAT IS PLAIN
WHEN HE ENTERED THE SITTING ROOM HE NOTICED THAT THE OLD HAIR-CLOTH SOFA WAS ABSENT
ALL THE WAY HOME WASHINGTON LAY WITH HIS FACE AGAINST THE COLONEL'S SHOULDER AND MERELY GROANED AND WEPT
WHAT YOU WANT IS THE APPEARANCE OF HEAT NOT THE HEAT ITSELF--THAT'S THE IDEA
WHEN A STRANGE STILLNESS AND SUSPENSE PERVADES THE WAITING AIR
ONLY GIVE HIM ONE MORE CHANCE
THE FRONT AND RIGHT HAND VIEWS GIVE YOU THE CITY AT LARGE
AND THERE IS GOING TO BE FAR MORE FOR EACH THAN ONE PERSON CAN SPEND
GOOD NIGHT MR BRIERLY RUTH'S CLEAR VOICE SOUNDED AFTER THEM AS THEY WENT DOWN THE WALK
THEY HAD NOT BEEN IN THE FIELD OVER TWO WEEKS WHEN HARRY WROTE TO HIS FRIEND COL
THE TWANG OF A BANJO BECAME AUDIBLE AS THEY DREW NEARER AND THEY SAW A COUPLE OF NEGROES FROM SOME NEIGHBORING PLANTATION BREAKING DOWN A JUBA IN APPROVED STYLE AMID THE HI HI'S OF THE SPECTATORS
YOU AND I MAY NOT SEE THE DAY BUT THEY'LL SEE IT
I HAVE NO OPINION ABOUT IT DIST
THE NEWS OF THE MURDER WAS MADE THE EXCITEMENT OF THE DAY
HE COULD NOT GO ON MUCH LONGER AND ALMOST EVERYBODY EXCEPT HIMSELF HAD THOUGHT IT WAS USELESS TO GO ON AS LONG AS HE HAD BEEN DOING
WHAN PE HORDE IS THYNNE AS OF SERUYSE NOUGHT REPLENESSHED WITH GRETE DIUERSITE OF METE DRINKE GOOD CHERE MAY THEN SUFFISE WITH HONEST TALKYNG THE BOOK OF CURTESYE
THE WAITERS AT THE HOTEL WOULD DO MORE FOR HIM THAN FOR ANY OTHER GUEST AND HE MADE A GREAT MANY ACQUAINTANCES AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ST LOUIS WHO LIKED HIS SENSIBLE AND LIBERAL VIEWS ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WESTERN COUNTRY AND ABOUT ST LOUIS
I SUBMIT YOUR HONOR THAT WE CANNOT BE INTERRUPTED IN THIS MANNER
VIA PECUNIA
HE WANTED ME TO GO OUT THERE AND ENGINEER THAT THING BUT I SAID NO DILWORTHY I MUST BE ON HAND HERE,--BOTH ON LAURA'S ACCOUNT AND THE BILL'S--BUT YOU'VE NO TRIFLING GENIUS FOR ORGANIZATION YOURSELF SAID I--AND I WAS RIGHT
HIS OTHER SHOULDER STOLE THE BLOOM FROM MANY A LOVELY CHEEK THAT BRUSHED HIM IN THE SURGING CRUSH BUT HE NOTED IT NOT
WHY WASHINGTON--BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING ABOUT IT--ANY MAN CAN SEE THAT THERE'S WHOLE ATLANTIC OCEANS OF CASH IN IT GULFS AND BAYS THROWN IN
BUT THEY COULD NOT QUIET DOWN AND THEY DID NOT
CHILDREN HONOR YOUR PARENTS AND BE GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR PROVIDING FOR YOU THE PRECIOUS PRIVILEGES OF A SUNDAY SCHOOL
THERE WAS BUT ONE LETTER AND IT WAS FOR THE POSTMASTER
AND THEN SLOWLY BEGINNING TO MOVE THEY WERE OFF AGAIN SHAKING POUNDING SCREAMING THROUGH THE NIGHT
THE HON
THE HON
THE HON
THE HON
BY THE MUDDY ROADSIDE STOOD A NEW LOG CABIN ONE STORY HIGH--THE STORE
HER TRIAL WILL BE OVER BEFORE CONGRESS HAS HALF PURIFIED ITSELF.--AND DOESN'T IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT BY THE TIME IT HAS EXPELLED ALL ITS IMPURE MEMBERS THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH MEMBERS LEFT TO DO BUSINESS LEGALLY WHY I DID NOT SAY CONGRESS WOULD EXPEL ANYBODY WELL WON'T IT EXPEL ANYBODY NOT NECESSARILY
SHE AT FIRST SAID SHE KNEW MR TROLLOP AND WAS AWARE THAT HE HAD A BLANK-BLANK;"--[**HER PRIVATE FIGURE OF SPEECH FOR BROTHER--OR SON-IN-LAW]--BUT MR BUCKSTONE SAID THAT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO CONCEIVE WHAT SO CURIOUS A PHRASE AS BLANK-BLANK MIGHT MEAN AND HAD NO WISH TO PRY INTO THE MATTER SINCE IT WAS PROBABLY PRIVATE HE WOULD NEVERTHELESS VENTURE THE BLIND ASSERTION THAT NOTHING WOULD ANSWER IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE AND DURING THIS PARTICULAR SESSION BUT TO BE EXCEEDINGLY WARY AND KEEP CLEAR AWAY FROM MR TROLLOP
IT WANTED AN EXAMPLE
WHEN HE WAS CARRIED INTO THE AIR HE REVIVED AND SAID IT WAS NOTHING
I DON'T CARE YOU KNOW HE WROTE TO HARRY SO MUCH ABOUT THE NIGGROES
I SAY TO MY WIFE GIVE ME A RUSSIAN EVERY TIME FOR A TABLE COMRADE
SON-IN-LAW SINECURE IN THE NEGRO INSTITUTION
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I SHALL GO
NOW SAID SHE THESE GENTLEMEN ARE TO VOTE AND WORK FOR THE BILL SIMPLY OUT OF LOVE FOR THE NEGRO--AND OUT OF PURE GENEROSITY I HAVE PUT IN A RELATIVE OF EACH AS A MEMBER OF THE UNIVERSITY INCORPORATION
THOSE CHECKED OFF ARE ALL RIGHT AH--'M--'M RUNNING HIS EYE DOWN THE LIST
HE IS MINE NOW DAMN THE WOMAN SAID THE COLONEL AS HE PICKED HIS WAY DOWN THE STEPS
IF HE HAD BEEN PROVEN GUILTY OF THEFT ARSON LICENTIOUSNESS INFANTICIDE AND DEFILING GRAVES I BELIEVE THEY WOULD HAVE SUSPENDED HIM FOR TWO DAYS YOU CAN DEPEND ON IT WASHINGTON
THAT MR DILWORTHY CAME TO SAINT'S REST AND REPORTED TO BE BUYING PLEDGES OF VOTES WITH MONEY
I KNOW THEIR WIVES THEIR CHILDREN THEIR BABIES--I EVEN MADE IT A POINT TO BE ON GOOD TERMS WITH THEIR LACKEYS
AND THE TRAIN WENT ON
IT IS ONLY HER INDOMITABLE WILL THAT HAS KEPT HER UP FOR WEEKS
FOR INSTANCE CALL THIS WAITER ST LOUIS
THAT WAS PLAIN SHE SAID
I TOLD HER THOUGH TO GO SLOW ADDED THE COLONEL AS IF THAT MYSTERIOUS ADMONITION FROM HIM WOULD SET EVERYTHING RIGHT
HOW PINCHED THEY WERE PERHAPS NO ONE KNEW BUT CLAY TO WHOM THEY LOOKED FOR ALMOST THEIR WHOLE SUPPORT
DO WE NOT ALL LIKE THE MAUDLIN HERO WHO IS SNEAKING ROUND THE RIGHT ENTRANCE IN WAIT TO STEAL THE PRETTY WIFE OF HIS RICH AND TYRANNICAL NEIGHBOR FROM THE PASTE-BOARD COTTAGE AT THE LEFT ENTRANCE
IT IS USELESS TO ASK ME WHY IT MUST BE SO
OUR CREDIT WILL BE SERIOUSLY MOST SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED
THE PASSENGERS PROTESTED AND SOME OF THEM SAID TO EACH OTHER THAT'S TOO BAD AS THEY ALWAYS DO IN SUCH CASES BUT NONE OF THEM OFFERED TO TAKE A HAND WITH PHILIP
WITHIN THREE DAYS OF THE END OF THE SESSION THEY WILL BE DONE PUTTING THROUGH THE PRELIMINARIES THEN THEY WILL BE READY FOR NATIONAL BUSINESS
HIS LOVE WAS SO FAR ENNOBLED AND BECOME A VERY DIFFERENT THING FROM ITS BEGINNING IN HAWKEYE
THEN CLAUSE BY CLAUSE THE BILL WAS READ DISCUSSED AND AMENDED IN TRIFLING PARTICULARS AND NOW THE COMMITTEE ROSE AND REPORTED
THAT SHE MADE A REQUEST TO THE SERVANTS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE DISTURBED
AT LENGTH SHE INTERRUPTED THE CONVERSATION BY ASKING YOU'D SELL THE STOCK I SUPPOSE MR BIGLER TO ANYBODY WHO WAS ATTRACTED BY THE PROSPECTUS O CERTAINLY SERVE ALL ALIKE SAID MR BIGLER NOW NOTICING RUTH FOR THE FIRST TIME AND A LITTLE PUZZLED BY THE SERENE INTELLIGENT FACE THAT WAS TURNED TOWARDS HIM
THEY COME SINGLY SOMETIMES
IN DUE COURSE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE REACHED THAT ORDER OF BUSINESS WHICH IS TERMED NOTICES OF BILLS AND THEN THE HON
HE HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN BEEN ENCOURAGED BY GOOD INDICATIONS BUT HE HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN BEEN DISAPPOINTED
WE ARE NOW REMINDED OF A NOTE WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE NOTORIOUS BURGLAR MURPHY IN WHICH HE FINDS FAULT WITH A STATEMENT OF OURS TO THE EFFECT THAT HE HAD SERVED ONE TERM IN THE PENITENTIARY AND ALSO ONE IN THE U
QUESTION
HEARD THE STAGE HORN BUT HAD A PARTY I COULDN'T SHAKE OFF--MAN THAT'S GOT AN ENORMOUS THING ON HAND--WANTS ME TO PUT SOME CAPITAL INTO IT--AND I TELL YOU MY BOY I COULD DO WORSE I COULD DO A DEAL WORSE
HE FREQUENTLY ACCOMPANIED HENRY PART WAY DOWN TOWN TO WHAT THE LATTER CALLED HIS OFFICE IN BROAD STREET TO WHICH HE WENT OR PRETENDED TO GO WITH REGULARITY EVERY DAY
AND I TOLD HIM AS A FRIEND HE'D BETTER SHEER OFF FROM LAURA
DID I SAY HE
LAURA READ THE LETTER WITH A LITTLE SIGH MAY BE AS SHE THOUGHT OF OTHER DAYS BUT WITH CONTEMPT ALSO AND SHE PUT IT INTO THE FIRE WITH THE THOUGHT THEY ARE ALL ALIKE HARRY WAS IN THE HABIT OF WRITING TO PHILIP FREELY AND BOASTING ALSO ABOUT HIS DOINGS AS HE COULD NOT HELP DOING AND REMAIN HIMSELF
LAURA PROVIDED SEATS FOR HER VISITORS AND THEY IMMEDIATELY LAUNCHED FORTH INTO A BREEZY SPARKLING CONVERSATION WITH THAT EASY CONFIDENCE WHICH IS TO BE FOUND ONLY AMONG PERSONS ACCUSTOMED TO HIGH LIFE
WE ALWAYS SUPPOSED HE WAS AN IRISHMAN BUT AFTER HE GOT RICH HE WENT ABROAD FOR A YEAR OR TWO AND WHEN HE CAME BACK YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUSED TO SEE HOW INTERESTED HE WAS IN A POTATO
THAT'S WASHINGTON HAWKINS--HER BROTHER NO IS IT VERY OLD FAMILY OLD KENTUCKY FAMILY I BELIEVE
LAURA'S FEW FRIENDS WROTE TO HER OR CAME AND TALKED WITH HER AND PLEADED WITH HER TO RETIRE WHILE IT WAS YET TIME AND NOT ATTEMPT TO FACE THE GATHERING STORM
AND NOW WITHOUT PAUSE OR FEAR THE TRAIN HAD MOUNTED A TRESTLE-WORK HIGH IN AIR AND WAS CREEPING ALONG THE TOP OF IT WHILE A SWIFT TORRENT FOAMED A HUNDRED FEET BELOW
HE HAS NO NOTION WHAT ELIZABETH IS AND ALWAYS RESOLVES THAT THE NEXT TIME HE GOES THAT WAY HE WILL LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SEE WHAT IT IS LIKE
WHEN PHILIP CAME INTO THE PRESENCE OF THIS ATTRACTIVE WOMAN HE COULD NOT REALIZE THAT SHE WAS THE SUBJECT OF ALL THE SCANDAL HE HAD HEARD
WE MAY REJOICE FREELY NOW MY SON--PROVIDENCE HAS CROWNED OUR EFFORTS WITH SUCCESS CHAPTER XXV
CLIMBED ABOUT THE BELL
STILL IF YOU GREATLY PREFER GOING INTO THE DOME GO
NO WE DIDN'T
WHY YOU WERE A WITNESS OH YES TO THE POPULAR EYE TO THE POPULAR EYE--BUT I KNEW WHEN I WAS DROPPING INFORMATION AND WHEN I WAS LETTING DRIVE AT THE COURT WITH AN INSIDIOUS ARGUMENT
PHILIP SO YEARNED TO BRING HER BACK TO LIFE HE WILLED IT SO STRONGLY AND PASSIONATELY THAT HIS WILL APPEARED TO AFFECT HERS AND SHE SEEMED SLOWLY TO DRAW LIFE FROM HIS
SOME HAD ONE IDEA OF THE SCHEME AND SOME ANOTHER BUT NOBODY HAD ANY EXACT KNOWLEDGE UPON THE SUBJECT
YOU THINK I WILL LET YOU LIVE WITH THAT WOMAN
THE LANDSCAPE STILL WORE AN ALMOST WINTRY APPEARANCE WHEN OUR TRAVELERS LEFT CHICAGO
RUTH ADVANCED AND WITH A NOT VERY STEADY HAND LIFTED THE WHITE COVERING FROM THE UPPER PART OF THE FIGURE AND TURNED IT DOWN
THROW AWAY YOUR TRAPS IF NECESSARY AND COME EMPTY-HANDED
HE LAID THE BOOK ASIDE AND SAID COMPOSEDLY
IT WAS UNACCOUNTABLE TO BIGLER
HE DID NOT MAKE ANY OBJECTIONS NOT EXACTLY HE SAID--SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID ASKED LAURA GLANCING FURTIVELY AT HIM
A LARGE BUT RATHER SPARE MAN WITH BROAD SHOULDERS AND A MASSIVE HEAD COVERED WITH CHESTNUT CURLS WHICH FELL DOWN UPON HIS COAT COLLAR AND WHICH HE HAD A HABIT OF SHAKING AS A LION IS SUPPOSED TO SHAKE HIS MANE
WELL I AM GLAD OF IT--I'M GLAD OF IT
THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT STIRS A PASSING INTEREST IN MY MIND I'M COMING TO THAT THEN SHE SAID MUCH AS IF SHE WERE TALKING TO HERSELF
WHAT ELSE WERE THEY FOR
HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS FEET AGAIN OR WOULD BE IF MR BOLTON COULD TIDE HIM OVER SHOAL WATER FOR NINETY DAYS
AS WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO INTERPRET THE ECONOMY OF PROVIDENCE THE LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS AS NOTHING TO THAT OF THE NATION OR THE RACE
HERE IT IS!"--AND SHE DISPLAYED A SHEET OF MANUSCRIPT
WHAT DIFFERENCE IS IT GOING TO MAKE
BALLOON IS A WHOLE-HEARTED FELLOW
PROBABLY HOWEVER THE EIGHT YEARS HAD BEEN HAPPIER TO HIM THAN TO ANY OTHERS IN HIS CIRCLE FOR THE TIME HAD BEEN MOSTLY SPENT IN A BLISSFUL DREAM OF THE COMING OF ENORMOUS WEALTH
THIS SORT OF CONDUCT MARKED EVERY ENTRY TO A STATION AND EVERY EXIT FROM IT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US
IN FACT SIR AS I ONCE SAID TO GOVERNOR WILL YOU STATE TO THE JURY WHAT HAS BEEN THE EFFECT OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS WANDERING AND EVIDENTLY UNSETTLED BEING SUPPOSED TO BE HER FATHER UPON THE MIND OF MISS HAWKINS FOR SO MANY YEARS QUESTION OBJECTED TO
IS THAT YOUR FIGURE MR BRIERLY ACCORDING TO OUR SURVEYS SAID HARRY A MILLION WOULD DO IT
HE REGRETTED THAT IT WAS PLAIN NOW THAT SUCH WAS THE MAN'S OBJECT AND THAT PUNISHMENT COULD NOT WITH SAFETY TO THE SENATE'S HONOR BE WITHHELD
SHE COULD NOT REALLY TELL WHETHER SHE WANTED TO FIND HIM AND SPOIL IT ALL OR NOT
AIN'T ANY HAY AND OATS
NOT SO LONG AS YOU LIVE COL
YOUR RELIGIOUS PAPER IS BY FAR THE BEST VEHICLE FOR A THING OF THIS KIND BECAUSE THEY'LL LEAD YOUR ARTICLE AND PUT IT RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THE READING MATTER
AND MORE
PERHAPS THEE DOESN'T KNOW THEE OWN MIND
YOU'LL BE HAPPY YET AND BERIAH SELLERS WILL BE THERE TO SEE THANK GOD I BELIEVE IT
ST LOUIS WAS A GREATER CITY BUT ITS FLOATING POPULATION DID NOT HAIL FROM GREAT DISTANCES AND SO IT HAD THE GENERAL FAMILY ASPECT OF THE PERMANENT POPULATION
AT BREAKFAST SHE ASKED IF ANY ONE HAD HEARD ANY UNUSUAL NOISE DURING THE NIGHT
MR BOLTON NEVER COULD SAY NO TO ANY OF THEM NOT EVEN SAID RUTH AGAIN TO THE SOCIETY FOR STAMPING OYSTER SHELLS WITH SCRIPTURE TEXTS BEFORE THEY WERE SOLD AT RETAIL
LAURA INSISTED ON FURNISHING THE TICKETS
HOW STUPID AND TIRESOME THESE PEOPLE ARE SHE SAID
THENCE BY THE PIPE TO BELSHAZZAR WHICH IS THE SALT-CELLAR
THEY BRING PEACE TO A HOUSE THEY DIFFUSE SERENE CONTENT IN A ROOM FULL OF MIXED COMPANY THOUGH THEY MAY SAY VERY LITTLE AND ARE APPARENTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THEIR OWN POWER
SAID HE WAS BOUND TO BE ELECTED AND COULD THEN RUIN HIM NOBLE IF HE VOTED NO
THE INSTANT THE LAST MOTION WAS DECIDED THE ENEMIES OF THE UNIVERSITY ROSE AND FLOCKED OUT OF THE HALL TALKING ANGRILY AND ITS FRIENDS FLOCKED AFTER THEM JUBILANT AND CONGRATULATORY
HE IS EMBARRASSED WHICH TO CHOOSE AND IS NOT UNLIKELY TO WASTE YEARS IN DALLYING WITH HIS CHANCES BEFORE GIVING HIMSELF TO THE SERIOUS TUG AND STRAIN OF A SINGLE OBJECT
WHAT WAS LAURA'S OBJECT IN TAKING HARRY
HE IS FAIRLY HOOKED POOR THING
MY FATHER USED TO ALWAYS SAY SIR CAPT
THE OFFICE WAS IN THE PRINCIPAL STREET
LAURA WAS CRUSHED
OH YES INDEED
GENERAL BOSWELL WAS IN HIS OFFICE
HE HAD SAVED THE LIFE OF THE PRISONER
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE BUCKSTONE LEAD MR TROLLOP ON TO GET A GREAT SPEECH WRITTEN FOR HIM
SELBY WAS FOUND LYING ON THE FLOOR BLEEDING BUT NOT DEAD
THERE WERE ONLY A HANDFUL OF COARSE MEN AND TEN OR TWELVE STILL COARSER WOMEN LOLLING UPON THE BENCHES AND SCATTERED ABOUT SINGLY AND IN COUPLES
BUT LAURA HAD CAUTIONED HER
HE FETCHED EM FOR HER EVERY MORNING AND SHE ALWAYS KISSED HIM
AT NIGHT THE DAY'S CONTRIBUTION OF DETRACTION INNUENDO AND MALICIOUS CONJECTURE WOULD BE CANVASSED IN HER MIND AND THEN SHE WOULD DRIFT INTO A COURSE OF THINKING
BUT THE COURT KNEW IT BLESS YOU AND WEAKENED EVERY TIME
IT SPARES NO EFFORT FOR THE COMFORT OF THE TRAVELING PUBLIC PHILIP NEVER HAD BEEN BEFORE IN BASCOM'S SWAMP AND THERE WAS NOTHING INVITING IN IT TO DETAIN HIM
THE PERNICIOUS DOCTRINES WHICH WE HAVE ANNOUNCED AS PREVAILING IN AMERICAN SOCIETY HAVE BEEN AGAIN ILLUSTRATED
THAT IS RIGHT
DIED YEARS AGO A MISERABLE DEATH SIR A RUINED MAN A POOR SOT
LIVELY NOW AYE-AYE SIR A RIOT OF SHOUTING AND TRAMPLING FLOATED UP FROM BELOW PRESENTLY AND THE UNEASY STEERING OF THE BOAT SOON SHOWED THAT SHE WAS GETTING DOWN BY THE HEAD THE THREE MEN IN THE PILOT HOUSE BEGAN TO TALK IN SHORT SHARP SENTENCES LOW AND EARNESTLY
HAD YOU THE LEAST SUSPICION OF THE PRISONER'S INTENTION UP TO THE MOMENT OF THE SHOOTING NOT THE LEAST ANSWERED HARRY EARNESTLY
AS THIS THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH HIS MIND HE WAS LOOKING AT THE REMARKABLE FIGURE OF THE HERO OF NEW ORLEANS HOLDING ITSELF BY MAIN STRENGTH FROM SLIDING OFF THE BACK OF THE REARING BRONZE HORSE AND LIFTING ITS HAT IN THE MANNER OF ONE WHO ACKNOWLEDGES THE PLAYING OF THAT MARTIAL AIR
WE KNOW EACH OTHER--DISGUISES ARE NONSENSE
WE ARE GOING A LOT OF US RAILROAD MEN ENGINEERS CONTRACTORS
STAND BY WHISPERED GEORGE
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE AGAINST YOU ON THE FIRST FOR THE SAKE OF APPEARANCES AND THEN COME OUT FOR YOU ALL IN A BODY ON THE SECOND--I'VE FIXED ALL THAT
BUT STILL THERE IS VERY LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT I--HOWEVER WE WILL NOT DISCUSS IT FURTHER NOW REMEMBER THAT THE SOONER WE GET TO WORK THE BETTER MISS HAWKINS PUBLIC CURIOSITY IS SO FICKLE
THE RATHER COMMON-PLACE AND UNFORMED HAND-WRITING SEEMED TO HIM PECULIAR AND CHARACTERISTIC DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER WOMAN
IT TAKES A WOMAN TO GET ANY THING THROUGH THE LAND OFFICE
PERHAPS HE WAS NOT SO MUCH AT REST OR SO CONTENTED WITH HER AS WITH ALICE
THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO DO ANYTHING FOR THEMSELVES AND IT DID NOT SEEM TO OCCUR TO THEM TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT NOW
OF COURSE SAID HARRY THERE WILL HAVE TO BE A BRANCH TRACK BUILT AND A SWITCH-BACK UP THE HILL YES THERE WILL BE NO TROUBLE ABOUT GETTING THE MONEY FOR THAT NOW
I SEE THE FOREIGN MINISTERS AND THAT SORT AFTER HER
SHE FELT LIKE A LOST PERSON WHO HAS TRAVELED DOWN A LONG LANE IN GOOD HOPE OF ESCAPE AND JUST AS THE NIGHT DESCENDS FINDS HIS PROGRESS BARRED BY A BRIDGE-LESS RIVER WHOSE FURTHER SHORE IF IT HAS ONE IS LOST IN THE DARKNESS
THE NEXT DAY MR THOMPSON MADE A HASTY SURVEY OF THE STREAM FOR A MILE OR TWO SO THAT THE COLONEL AND HARRY WERE ENABLED TO SHOW ON THEIR MAP HOW NOBLY THAT WOULD ACCOMMODATE THE CITY
THAT IS TO SAY YOU HAD TO BE EITHER A KNAVE OR A--WELL A FOOL--THERE WAS NO MIDDLE GROUND
GIVE US NEWSPAPER PERSECUTION ENOUGH AND WE ARE SAFE
SELLERS LIKED THIS TALK AMAZINGLY THOUGH HE WAS SOMETIMES A LITTLE AT SEA IN IT--AND PERHAPS THAT DIDN'T LESSEN THE RELISH OF THE CONVERSATION TO THE CORRESPONDENTS
THEN THE YOUTH FOUND HIS VOICE AND BEGGED SELLERS TO DROP EVERYTHING AND HURRY UP THE EYE-WATER
I'M GOING TO SEE THAT CHAIRMAN AND HUMMING A CHEERY OPERA AIR SHE DEPARTED TO HER ROOM TO DRESS FOR GOING OUT
HANG IT HE WOULD SAY TO HIMSELF SHE IS NOTHING BUT PURE INTELLECT ANYWAY
HE REMEMBERED THAT AND WAS GLAD HE NEVER YIELDED AND PLAYED ON SUNDAY
PARTIES IN NEW YORK ONLY LAST WEEK WANTED ME TO GO DOWN INTO ARIZONA IN A BIG DIAMOND INTEREST
IT HAS TAKEN A LONG TIME TO PERFECT OUR SYSTEM BUT IT IS THE MOST ADMIRABLE IN THE WORLD NOW SO ONE OF THOSE LONG STUPID INVESTIGATIONS ALWAYS TURNS OUT IN THAT LAME SILLY WAY
YOU SEE HOW SHE WAS SITUATED GENTLEMEN
PHILIP DETERMINED TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND SEE FOR HIMSELF
NOW YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT ME--COULDN'T BE ME
BUT FATIGUE SOON BEGAN TO SHOW ITSELF AND ONE AFTER ANOTHER THEY CLIMBED UP AND OCCUPIED THE TOP RAIL OF THE FENCE HUMP-SHOULDERED AND GRAVE LIKE A COMPANY OF BUZZARDS ASSEMBLED FOR SUPPER AND LISTENING FOR THE DEATH-RATTLE
HE RAN UP THE STEPS AND RANG
AT THE DOOR OF THE LATTER STOOD A NEGRESS WITH A BRIGHT TURBAN ON HER HEAD TO WHOM PHILIP CALLED CAN YOU TELL ME AUNTIE HOW FAR IT IS TO THE TOWN OF MAGNOLIA WHY BRESS YOU CHILE LAUGHED THE WOMAN YOU'S DERE NOW IT WAS TRUE
THERE NOW THAT'S ALL RIGHT--THE CHAIR'S BETTER
THE WATCHERS SAT BY AND WIPED THE GATHERING DAMPS FROM HIS FOREHEAD WHILE THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED DOWN THEIR FACES
SHE SAW HERSELF AGAIN IN THE BUDDING GRACE OF HER TWELVE YEARS DECKED IN HER DAINTY PRIDE OF RIBBONS CONSORTING WITH THE BEES AND THE BUTTERFLIES BELIEVING IN FAIRIES HOLDING CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSE WITH THE FLOWERS BUSYING HERSELF ALL DAY LONG WITH AIRY TRIFLES THAT WERE AS WEIGHTY TO HER AS THE AFFAIRS THAT TAX THE BRAINS OF DIPLOMATS AND EMPERORS
BUT WHO ARE THEY?--ANIMALS
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS FULL OF LITTLE AND BIG RUMORS AND OF VAST UNDEFINED EXPECTATIONS
AND SAID HE HAD NOT FINISHED HIS DEPOSITION
AND THEN THERE'S YOUR BIG HIGH-SOUNDING MILLIONAIRE NAMES STUCK INTO YOUR ADVERTISEMENTS AS STOCKHOLDERS--ANOTHER CARD THAT--AND THEY ARE STOCKHOLDERS TOO BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE STOCK AND NON-ASSESSABLE AT THAT--SO THEY'RE AN EXPENSIVE LOT
THE MAN WHO HAD SEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND HAD EVEN TALKED WITH HIM
I HAVE BEEN ASKING MYSELF AS I SAT HERE WHERE AM I
THE PRESSURE BEHIND WAS TOO GREAT AND THE NEXT PHILIP WAS DASHED BACKWARDS OVER THE SEAT
IN THE EYES OF THE WOMEN OF THE AUDIENCE MR BRAHAM WAS THE HERO OF THE OCCASION
HARRY OBSERVED THAT AS SOON AS ONE LISTENER HAD ABSORBED THE STORY HE TURNED ABOUT AND DELIVERED IT TO HIS NEXT NEIGHBOR AND THE LATTER INDIVIDUAL STRAIGHTWAY PASSED IT ON
FOR LAURA HAD HER DREAMS
MAY GOD FORGIVE THIS WICKED MAN AS I DO
YOU WILL LIKE THE CLIMATE WHEN YOU GET USED TO IT
AND ALONG WITH THESE IDEAS SHE IMBIBED OTHER VERY CRUDE ONES IN REGARD TO THE EMANCIPATION OF WOMAN
TOUGH STORIES COME TO ME BUT I PUT'EM AWAY
SUTLER--BUT THEY'D HAVE TO TIE HIM ON LAURA WAS IN THE DRAWING ROOM
I VALUE YOUR VOTE MR TROLLOP BUT I VALUE YOUR INFLUENCE MORE
ALL THIS WOULD BE PROVED BY UNIMPEACHABLE WITNESSES
THE PLAGUE CAN'T COME WHERE THIS ARTICLE IS MY BOY PLAGUE
THE ROOM SWAM BEFORE HER FOR A MOMENT AND THE COLONEL STEPPED TOWARDS HER BUT SHE WAVED HIM BACK AS HOT ANGER AGAIN COURSED THROUGH HER VEINS AND SAID AND YOU DARE COME WITH HER HERE AND TELL ME OF IT HERE AND MOCK ME WITH IT
YES THE RAILROAD--TELL ME ABOUT THE RAILROAD AHA MY GIRL DON'T YOU SEE
A SLOVENLY URCHIN OF TEN WAS DREAMING OVER A RUDE WEATHER-VANE OF HIS OWN CONTRIVING
BUT HE'S GOT A WIFE
VILLAGERS ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW
IT BORE MANY INTERNAL EVIDENCES OF ITS TRUTH
BUT NOW THIS ONE SEEMS SATISFIED TO CALL IT AN INIQUITOUS SCHEME INIQUITOUS DOES NOT EXASPERATE ANYBODY
COAL HE BENT OVER AND WHISPERED AGAIN THERE'S WORLD--WORLDS OF IT ON THIS LAND
UNCLE DAN'L COLORED AGED 40
SENATORS THREW DOWN THEIR EXTRAS AND SNATCHED A WORD OR TWO WITH EACH OTHER IN WHISPERS
SELBY IS IT NOT THE COLONEL STAGGERED BACK CAUGHT HIMSELF BY A CHAIR AND TURNED TOWARDS HER A LOOK OF TERROR
IT LINGERED ABOUT HER YOUNG GIRLHOOD WITH A CARESSING REGRET
HE KNEW HE WAS NOT FITTED FOR THE TECHNICALITIES OF THE SUBORDINATE DEPARTMENTS BUT HE COULD WRITE LEADERS WITH PERFECT EASE HE WAS SURE
BUT I NEVER SAW ONE WELL LAURA HAWKINS COMES VERY NEAR IT
DON'T YOU THINK HE IS DISTINGUISHED LOOKING WHAT
BUT YOU REMEMBER I WAS INTERRUPTED AND DID NOT EXPLAIN TO YOU NEVER MIND I KNOW
YOU MOUT TAKE AN TAH DE HEAD OFF'N DAT MAN AN HE WOULDN'T SCASELY FINE IT OUT
THEE HAS ANOTHER LETTER FROM YOUNG STERLING SAID ELI BOLTON
THEY WILL GET A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND A STAY OF PROCEEDINGS AND A SUPERSEDEAS AND A NEW TRIAL AND A NOLLE PROSEQUI AND THERE YOU ARE
STRUCK IT EH
HENRY BRIERLY WAS AT THE DILWORTHY'S CONSTANTLY AND ON SUCH TERMS OF INTIMACY THAT HE CAME AND WENT WITHOUT QUESTION
YOU ARE OFFENDED THOUGH TO HAVE ME SPEAK OF IT NOT IN THE LEAST
NO HOME COULD BE PLEASANTER THAN RUTH'S
THAT WAS HIS REPUTATION AND IT WAS A DESERVED ONE
A HALF HOUR OF PROFOUND THINKING ALWAYS FOLLOWED
CHILDREN WILL BE CHILDREN YOU KNOW
THIS IS NOT HISTORY WHICH HAS JUST BEEN WRITTEN
WHEN SHE CAME DOWN SHE APPEARED AS USUAL A LITTLE PALE MAY BE BUT UNCHANGED IN MANNER
HE WAS INDEED VERY RELUCTANT TO SELL ANY PART OF THE LAND AT ANY PRICE
HIS THOUGHT RAN ON
SHE MUST FIND HIM
YOU DON'T MEAN IT YOU CAN'T MEAN IT THROW IT AWAY
SHE ALWAYS HAD A PLAYFUL SHIELD AGAINST HIS SENTIMENT
GOSSIPS WILL TELL YOU THAT BY THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES IT WAS TO COST $12,000,000 AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT DID COME WITHIN $21,200,000 OF BUILDING IT FOR THAT SUM
THE WORK YOU DID FELL SHORT OF $10,000 A TRIFLE
YOU CAN FEEL FOR THIS POOR SUFFERING CHILD
I'VE GOT A LITTLE BELT OF SASSPARILLA LAND IN THERE JUST TUCKED AWAY UNOBSTRUSIVELY WAITING FOR MY LITTLE UNIVERSAL EXPECTORANT TO GET INTO SHAPE IN MY HEAD
MR O'RILEY FURNISHED SHINGLE NAILS TO THE NEW COURT HOUSE AT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A KEG AND EIGHTEEN GROSS OF 60-CENT THERMOMETERS AT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A DOZEN
A MOUNTAIN THAT STRETCHED ABROAD OVER WHOLE COUNTIES AND ROSE VERY GRADUALLY
SOMETHING WAS TAKING PLACE AT HIS FEET WHICH DID NOT ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
INDEED THEY LIVED TOGETHER IN NINTH STREET IN A BOARDING-HOUSE THERE WHICH HAD THE HONOR OF LODGING AND PARTIALLY FEEDING SEVERAL OTHER YOUNG FELLOWS OF LIKE KIDNEY WHO HAVE SINCE GONE THEIR SEVERAL WAYS INTO FAME OR INTO OBSCURITY
AND THERE WAS THAT IN RUTH'S MANNER--IN WHAT SHE GAVE HIM AND WHAT SHE WITHHELD--THAT WOULD HAVE MADE A HERO OF A VERY MUCH LESS PROMISING CHARACTER THAN PHILIP STERLING
JUST LOOK AT THEM BRIDGET DEAR
AND PHILIP FOUND THE WHOLE THING IN THE BILL WHEN HE CAME TO PAY IT
CUSTOM INURES THE MOST SENSITIVE PERSONS TO THAT WHICH IS AT FIRST MOST REPELLANT
WHAT I WANT IS TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND FIND OUT WHAT I AM
IF HE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL OR IF HE NEVER RETURNED--PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AS WELL
BUT HE LEARNED AFTERWARDS THAT THE WOMAN WHO LAYS HER HAND ON A MAN WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION WHATSOEVER IS ALWAYS ACQUITTED BY THE JURY
AND NOW HIS ANGRY COMMENTS RAN ON AGAIN
PHILIP STERLING'S CIRCUMSTANCES WERE BECOMING STRAIGHTENED
SHE HAD THE FATAL GIFT OF BEAUTY AND THAT MORE FATAL GIFT WHICH DOES NOT ALWAYS ACCOMPANY MERE BEAUTY THE POWER OF FASCINATION A POWER THAT MAY INDEED EXIST WITHOUT BEAUTY
IF HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING BUT MEDICINE THE CHANCE IS HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT THE CLOSE APPLICATION TO HER SPECIAL STUDY WAS BEGINNING TO TELL UPON RUTH'S DELICATE HEALTH ALSO AND THE SUMMER BROUGHT WITH IT ONLY WEARINESS AND INDISPOSITION FOR ANY MENTAL EFFORT
HAIR RUBBED OFF A LITTLE BUT THE MAIN STRUCTURE IS PERFECTLY SOUND DOES IT LEAK ANYWHERE LEAK
STRAIN OR DR KANE
HE VENTURED ONCE TO LET THE MIDNIGHT HOUR PASS WITHOUT CALLING LAURA BUT HE VENTURED NO MORE
THE STRUGGLES OF THE POOR ALWAYS TOUCHED HIM
IT WOULD BE AN ODD CIRCUMSTANCE TO SEE A GIRL GET EMPLOYMENT AT THREE OR FOUR DOLLARS A WEEK IN ONE OF THE GREAT PUBLIC CRIBS WITHOUT ANY POLITICAL GRANDEE TO BACK HER BUT MERELY BECAUSE SHE WAS WORTHY AND COMPETENT AND A GOOD CITIZEN OF A FREE COUNTRY THAT TREATS ALL PERSONS ALIKE WASHINGTON WOULD BE MILDLY THUNDERSTRUCK AT SUCH A THING AS THAT
GOD WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED HER TO LOVE GEORGE SELBY AS SHE DID AND HIM TO LOVE HER IF IT WAS RIGHT FOR SOCIETY TO RAISE UP A BARRIER BETWEEN THEM
HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THIS TIME
IF YOU'VE DONE WRONG SI HAWKINS IT'S A WRONG THAT WILL SHINE BRIGHTER AT THE JUDGMENT DAY THAN THE RIGHTS THAT MANY A MAN HAS DONE BEFORE YOU
MANY RESTORATIVES OF VERTUES RARE AND COSTLY CORDIALLES SHE DID APPLY TO MITIGATE HIS STUBBORNE MALADY
SHE TOOK THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO SEE COL
YOU MAY TELL HIM NOT TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF AND TO KEEP AWAY
IF YOU INQUIRE AROUND A LITTLE YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE ARE MORE BOARDINGHOUSES TO THE SQUARE ACRE IN WASHINGTON THAN THERE ARE IN ANY OTHER CITY IN THE LAND PERHAPS
POOR CHILD DON'T GRIEVE SO
SHE HAD ATTRIBUTED THIS LATTER PARTLY TO JEALOUSY OF HER FOR NO ONE IS WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE A FAULT IN HIMSELF WHEN A MORE AGREEABLE MOTIVE CAN BE FOUND FOR THE ESTRANGEMENT OF HIS ACQUAINTANCES
AN OPPORTUNITY OCCURRING PRESENTLY SHE PUT THE SAME QUESTION TO ANOTHER PERSON AND GOT AN ANSWER THAT SATISFIED HER
NOW A FORMER THOUGHT STRUCK HER--SHE WOULD SPEAK TO MRS HAWKINS
BY GEORGE YONDER COMES THE AMARANTH A SPARK APPEARED CLOSE TO THE WATER SEVERAL MILES DOWN THE RIVER
SUSAN CULLUM COLORED SERVANT AT SENATOR DILWORTHY'S WAS SWORN
BUT YOU ARE--SAFE
IT WAS NOT LONG HOWEVER BEFORE SMOKE BEGAN TO ISSUE FROM THE CITY CHIMNEYS
HE'S AN ABLE MAN DILWORTHY AND A GOOD MAN
WITH AN EFFORT HE HAD RAISED HIMSELF ALMOST WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO A SITTING POSTURE
RUTH BOLTON
I NEVER HAVE SEEN OR HEARD OF HIM SINCE UP TO THIS DAY
IN TIME IT CAME TO BE SAID THAT HER WAY WAS PAVED WITH BROKEN HEARTS
NOW I'M THE COLONEL AGAIN
HARRY WENT BUT HE SOON CAME BACK
THE CASE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AGAINST LAURA HAWKINS WAS FINALLY SET DOWN FOR TRIAL ON THE 15TH DAY OF FEBRUARY LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER THE SHOOTING OF GEORGE SELBY
AND AT THE END IN RESPONSE TO THE INQUIRY OF THE JUDGE SHE SAID IN A CLEAR LOW VOICE
ONLY IN PASSING AROUND THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA DID THE TRAIN NOT SEEM TO GO SLOW
NOT A SINGLE MEMBER WAS PAYING THE LEAST ATTENTION TO THE BUSINESS OF THE HOUR
SHE KEPT UP A CORRESPONDENCE WITH ALICE WHO PROMISED A VISIT IN THE FALL SHE READ SHE EARNESTLY TRIED TO INTEREST HERSELF IN HOME AFFAIRS AND SUCH PEOPLE AS CAME TO THE HOUSE
IF YOU HAVE KNOWN WHAT PERFECTION IS IN WOMAN IT IS FAIR TO ARGUE THAT INFERIORITY CANNOT INTEREST YOU NOW EVEN IF THAT WERE THE CASE IT COULD NOT AFFECT YOU MISS HAWKINS SAID THE CHAIRMAN GALLANTLY
JEFF THOMPSON AND I FIXED ALL THAT YOU KNOW
AND SO IF HER EXPENSIVE WAYS EVER TROUBLED HIM FOR A BRIEF MOMENT HE PRESENTLY DISMISSED THE THOUGHT AND SAID TO HIMSELF LET HER GO ON--EVEN IF SHE LOSES EVERYTHING SHE IS STILL SAFE--THIS INTEREST WILL ALWAYS AFFORD HER A GOOD EASY INCOME LAURA WAS ON EXCELLENT TERMS WITH A GREAT MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THERE WAS AN UNDERCURRENT OF SUSPICION IN SOME QUARTERS THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THAT DETESTED CLASS KNOWN AS LOBBYISTS BUT WHAT BELLE COULD ESCAPE SLANDER IN SUCH A CITY
THIS IS THE COUNTRY SIR
A LITTLE OF WHAT MR BOLTON HAS WEAKLY GIVEN TO UNWORTHY PEOPLE WOULD NOW ESTABLISH HIS FAMILY IN A SORT OF COMFORT AND RELIEVE RUTH OF THE EXCESSIVE TOIL FOR WHICH SHE INHERITED NO ADEQUATE PHYSICAL VIGOR
LAW SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SCIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENTS WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK IN THE ANTE-ROOM OF THE LAW OFFICE WHERE HE WAS WRITING PHILIP INVARIABLY ADVISED TO SETTLE--NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE--GREATLY TO THE DISGUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTICE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN COULD ONLY BE ATTAINED BY THE RECOGNIZED PROCESSES WITH THE ATTENDANT FEES
WHAT DID SHE CARE FOR TALK
HE SAID THAT IT WAS NOW FAR PAST MIDNIGHT
HE FOUND A YELLOW ENVELOPE LYING ON HIS RICKETY TABLE AND RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS OF A FAMILY SACRED TO THE TRANSMISSION OF TELEGRAMS
HE MIGHT NEVER SEE HER AGAIN
I TELL YOU IT'LL MAKE A STIR WHEN IT GETS ALONG
YOU NEVER SAW HER BUT SIS HAS SEEN HER WHEN SIS WAS A BABY-DIDN'T YOU SIS
EVERYTHING IS GOING RIGHT EVERYTHING'S GOING PERFECTLY RIGHT
HE TOLD ME SO HIMSELF AFTERWARDS THE NEXT TELEGRAM WAS FROM MR DILWORTHY
HE HAD A GREAT RESPECT FOR NATURE
BUT NO THE MEMORY OF HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL SAVED HIM FROM ALL HARM
ALL THESE PEOPLE PRESENTLY MANAGED TO DRAG THEMSELVES TO THE VICINITY OF THE HAWKINS WAGON AND THERE THEY TOOK UP PERMANENT POSITIONS HANDS IN POCKETS AND RESTING ON ONE LEG
WELL GET SOME--HAVE IT CHARGED TO ME--COME SPIN AROUND NOW
A BODY CAN'T EXCITE HER-CAN'T KEEP HER EXCITED ANYWAY
THE COURT ASSEMBLED AND WAITED
WE HAD HIM IN MY BED--MR OREILLE SLEPT IN THE GUEST ROOM AND I LAID DOWN BESIDE FRANCOIS--BUT NOT TO SLEEP BLESS YOU NO
IT WAS THIS SORT OF CONCERT AND PHILIP WAS THINKING THAT IT WAS THE MOST STUPID ONE HE EVER SAT THROUGH WHEN JUST AS THE SOPRANO WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT TOUCHING BALLAD COMIN THRO THE RYE THE SOPRANO ALWAYS SINGS COMIN THRO THE RYE ON AN ENCORE)--THE BLACK SWAN USED TO MAKE IT IRRESISTIBLE PHILIP REMEMBERED WITH HER ARCH IF A BODY KISS A BODY THERE WAS A CRY OF FIRE THE HALL IS LONG AND NARROW AND THERE IS ONLY ONE PLACE OF EGRESS
I WONDER WHAT DILWORTHY DOES THINK OF ME ANYWAY
I THE SENATOR SPRANG UP ALL AGLOW
I AM CONQUERED I AM OUT OF PROVISIONS OUT OF MONEY
MR HAWKINS HAD NEVER GONE INTO DETAILS WITH HIM ON THIS SUBJECT HE USED TO SHOW THEM TO ME AND SAY COL SELLERS YOU'VE A MIND TO UNTANGLE THIS SORT OF THING LORD HOW EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO ME
THEY IMPLORED THE PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR PURE WIVES THEIR SINLESS DAUGHTERS FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY FOR THE SAKE OF PUBLIC MORALS TO GIVE THIS WRETCHED CREATURE SUCH A REBUKE AS SHOULD BE AN ALL-SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO HER AND TO SUCH AS HER THAT THERE WAS A LIMIT WHERE THE FLAUNTING OF THEIR FOUL ACTS AND OPINIONS BEFORE THE WORLD MUST STOP
HE WAS OPPRESSED WITH CARES NOW
DON'T LEAVE US
WASHINGTON LAUNCHED OUT AN OBSERVATION OF HIS OWN
YOU SEE FROM WHAT WE COULD MAKE OUT HER FATHER WAS LAME IN THE LEFT LEG AND HAD A DEEP SCAR ON HIS LEFT FOREHEAD
MR DILWORTHY SAID THAT HIS HEART HAD BLED FOR HIM--INSOMUCH THAT HE HAD SEVERAL TIMES BEEN ON THE POINT OF TRYING TO GET SOME ONE TO DO SOMETHING FOR HIM
SWEETHEART SHE SAID TO PHILIP I WOULD NOT HAVE CARED TO COME BACK BUT FOR THY LOVE NOT FOR THY PROFESSION OH THEE MAY BE GLAD ENOUGH OF THAT SOME DAY WHEN THY COAL BED IS DUG OUT AND THEE AND FATHER ARE IN THE AIR AGAIN WHEN RUTH WAS ABLE TO RIDE SHE WAS TAKEN INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE PURE AIR WAS NECESSARY TO HER SPEEDY RECOVERY
EVEN THE WOMEN WERE ALL ADVOCATES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SOME PERSON AND THEY VIOLENTLY ESPOUSED OR DENOUNCED THIS OR THAT MEASURE AS IT WOULD AFFECT SOME RELATIVE ACQUAINTANCE OR FRIEND
NOT EVEN THE THOUGHT OF SEEING LAURA AT THE CAPITAL MADE HIM RESTLESS IN THE SOCIETY OF THE TWO YOUNG LADIES
WHY AREN'T TRUNKS ALWAYS BEING STOLEN WELL YES--SOME KINDS OF TRUNKS ARE VERY WELL THEN
MADE BY NATURE ON PURPOSE FOR A MART
THE FACT IS HENRY THAT I'M ABOUT TIRED OF TRYING TO FORCE MYSELF INTO THINGS AND AM QUITE WILLING TO TRY FLOATING WITH THE STREAM FOR A WHILE AND SEE WHERE I WILL LAND
BUT IT DID NOT TEAR ANY MORE AFTER IT GOT TO THE OUTSKIRTS
I SHALL HAVE TO SHOW YOU A LIFE THE SPORT OF FATE AND CIRCUMSTANCES HURRIED ALONG THROUGH SHIFTING STORM AND SUN BRIGHT WITH TRUSTING INNOCENCE AND ANON BLACK WITH HEARTLESS VILLAINY A CAREER WHICH MOVES ON IN LOVE AND DESERTION AND ANGUISH ALWAYS HOVERED OVER BY THE DARK SPECTRE OF INSANITY--AN INSANITY HEREDITARY AND INDUCED BY MENTAL TORTURE,--UNTIL IT ENDS IF END IT MUST IN YOUR VERDICT BY ONE OF THOSE FEARFUL ACCIDENTS WHICH ARE INSCRUTABLE TO MEN AND OF WHICH GOD ALONE KNOWS THE SECRET
THE THREE COMMITTEEMEN SONS-IN-LAW
AND SHE CRIED AND SAID THAT NOW THAT TROUBLES HAD BEGUN THEY WOULD NEVER END
IT WAS WHISPERED THAT SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS A STUMBLING BLOCK IN THE WAY OF AN IMMEDIATE SALE BECAUSE HE WAS RESOLVED THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT HAVE THE LANDS EXCEPT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO THE UPLIFTING OF THE NEGRO RACE
EVERYBODY SAID HE WAS ACCLIMATED NOW AND SAID IT CHEERFULLY
DIDN'T HEAR D DRAIN ONCET
THE COMMITTEE IS SAFE
THERE WAS SOMETHING FRIGHTFUL IN HER CALMNESS
WE COULD NOT TELL WHAT THE INTENTIONS OF PROVIDENCE ARE IN REGARD TO THESE PECULIAR PEOPLE BUT OUR DUTY WAS PLAIN
NOW I DIDN'T FORGET THE RAILROAD
THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME EXCITING TOPIC AT THE CAPITOL OR SOME HUGE SLANDER WAS RISING UP LIKE A MIASMATIC EXHALATION FROM THE POTOMAC THREATENING TO SETTLE NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE
DID IT LAST YEAR
AND ASKED WHOM HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE
SHE SAW THAT MANY WOMEN WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS MAKE A MISTAKE OF CARRYING TOO MUCH GIRLISHNESS INTO WOMANHOOD
I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF THAT IT IS A BARGAIN
THE WITNESS WILL CONFINE HIS REMARKS TO ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS THE COLONEL TURNED COURTEOUSLY TO THE JUDGE AND SAID CERTAINLY YOUR HONOR--CERTAINLY
BUT I WORK WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AGAINST HIS IMMIGRATION BILL,--AS PERTINACIOUSLY AND AS VINDICTIVELY INDEED AS HE WORKS AGAINST OUR UNIVERSITY
WARN'T DE LORD JES A CUMIN CHOW
STOP DON'T SIT DOWN ON THAT EXCLAIMED THE COLONEL
I HAVE HAD THEIR INTERESTS GREATLY AT HEART
STILL HE HAD MADE SOME
MERE MERIT FITNESS AND CAPABILITY ARE USELESS BAGGAGE TO YOU WITHOUT INFLUENCE THE POPULATION OF WASHINGTON CONSISTS PRETTY MUCH ENTIRELY OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND THE PEOPLE WHO BOARD THEM
TIME AND AGAIN MY WIFE I DEPENDED ON IT ALL THROUGH MY BOYHOOD AND NEVER TRIED TO DO AN HONEST STROKE OF WORK FOR MY LIVING RIGHT AGAIN--BUT THEN YOU I HAVE CHASED IT YEARS AND YEARS AS CHILDREN CHASE BUTTERFLIES
DE OLE NIGGAH'S READY LORD DE OLE THE FLAMING AND CHURNING STEAMER WAS RIGHT ABREAST THE PARTY AND NOT TWENTY STEPS AWAY
MY FATHER SAID HARRY WAS BRED A PHYSICIAN AND PRACTICED A LITTLE BEFORE HE WENT INTO WALL STREET
WILL THEY EVER COME BACK HERE ON THE RAILROAD AND THE STEAMBOAT AND SAY THIS ONE LITTLE SPOT SHALL NOT BE TOUCHED--THIS HOVEL SHALL BE SACRED--FOR HERE OUR FATHER AND OUR MOTHER SUFFERED FOR US THOUGHT FOR US LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR FUTURE AS SOLID AS THE HILLS YOU ARE A GREAT GOOD NOBLE SOUL SI HAWKINS AND I AM AN HONORED WOMAN TO BE THE WIFE OF SUCH A MAN"--AND THE TEARS STOOD IN HER EYES WHEN SHE SAID IT
HE WILL VOTE FOR OUR BILL--NO FEAR ABOUT THAT
THERE'S MILLIONS IN THE JOB
HE CONFESSED THAT EVERY CITIZEN'S FIRST DUTY IN SUCH CASE IS TO PUT ASIDE HIS OWN BUSINESS AND DEVOTE HIS TIME AND HIS BEST EFFORTS TO SEEING THAT THE INFRACTION IS PROMPTLY PUNISHED
SHE HEARD THE BELL SHE HEARD THE STEPS IN THE HALL AND THE EMPHATIC THUD OF THE SUPPORTING CANE
THEY ALWAYS DEPRECATED WHEN THERE WAS TROUBLE AHEAD
MR TROLLOP HAS GONE OVER TO THE PIRATES
I RECKON SHE HAIN'T BEEN DAH ALL NIGHT THE SENATOR AND PHILIP BOTH STARTED UP
OLD DAMRELL SAID
I HAVE BEEN VERY FOOLISH
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO BEGIN WITH LESS
MARK TIME BY THE LEFT FLANK FORWARD-MARCH AND THE COLONEL TOOK THE LEAD WITH LAURA ASTRIDE HIS NECK AND THE NEWLY-INSPIRED AND VERY GRATEFUL IMMIGRANTS PICKED UP THEIR TIRED LIMBS WITH QUITE A SPRING IN THEM AND DROPPED INTO HIS WAKE
HE HAD NEVER SEEN HER LOOK SO BEFORE
SO FOR SEVERAL DAYS PHILIP HELD THE DRILL AND TIM DID THE STRIKING
TRAGEDY IN HIGH LIFE
AND SAID
JUST COME WHENEVER YOU CAN AND COME AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN--THE OFTENER THE BETTER
GENTLEMEN
PERHAPS IT WAS THE SWIMMING EASE OF THE ACTING ON THE STAGE WHERE VIRTUE HAD ITS REWARD IN THREE EASY ACTS PERHAPS IT WAS THE EXCESSIVE LIGHT OF THE HOUSE OR THE MUSIC OR THE BUZZ OF THE EXCITED TALK BETWEEN ACTS PERHAPS IT WAS YOUTH WHICH BELIEVED EVERYTHING BUT FOR SOME REASON WHILE PHILIP WAS AT THE THEATRE HE HAD THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE IN LIFE AND HIS READY VICTORY IN IT
THE SENATOR HAVING REMARKED TO THE COLONEL THAT HE DELIGHTED TO HELP ANY DESERVING YOUNG MAN WHEN THE PROMOTION OF A PRIVATE ADVANTAGE COULD AT THE SAME TIME BE MADE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GENERAL GOOD
HE NEVER WALKED BROADWAY A PART OF ITS TIDE OF ABUNDANT SHIFTING LIFE WITHOUT FEELING SOMETHING OF THE FLUSH OF WEALTH AND UNCONSCIOUSLY TAKING THE ELASTIC STEP OF ONE WELL-TO-DO IN THIS PROSPEROUS WORLD
IT WAS SETTLED THEREFORE IN THE PROMPT WAY IN WHICH THINGS ARE SETTLED IN NEW YORK THAT THEY WOULD START WITH THE REST OF THE COMPANY NEXT MORNING FOR THE WEST
THE SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES THE ELOQUENCE EXPENDED ON THE JURY ARE ALL FOR EFFECT OUTSIDE
PERHAPS SOME APOLOGY TO THE READER IS NECESSARY IN VIEW OF OUR FAILURE TO FIND LAURA'S FATHER
THE BROAD STREETS GLOWED IN THE SUN AND THE WHITE-SHUTTERED HOUSES STARED AT THE HOT THOROUGHFARES LIKE CLOSED BAKERS OVENS SET ALONG THE HIGHWAY
IT'S A VAST IRON SPECULATION!--MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS IN IT
I DO BELIEVE THEE WOULDN'T HAVE SO READILY ALLOWED ME TO BEGIN THE STUDY OF MEDICINE IF IT HADN'T HAD THE NOVELTY OF AN EXPERIMENT TO THEE AND IS THEE SATISFIED WITH IT IF THEE MEANS IF I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT NO
AND WHEN HE WAS GONE MR DILWORTHY SAID TO HIMSELF I FEEL A GOOD DEAL RELIEVED NOW A GREAT DEAL RELIEVED THE SENATOR NOW TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO MATTERS TOUCHING THE SOULS OF HIS PEOPLE
MY PRECIOUS CHILDREN LOVE YOUR PARENTS LOVE YOUR TEACHERS LOVE YOUR SUNDAY SCHOOL BE PIOUS BE OBEDIENT BE HONEST BE DILIGENT AND THEN YOU WILL SUCCEED IN LIFE AND BE HONORED OF ALL MEN
THE LEFT HAND OF THE LEDGER WILL APPEAR THE RIGHT LOOKED AT FROM THE OTHER SIDE
AND MRS SELLERS LOOKED ACTUALLY DISTRESSED
BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANY ENCOURAGING RESULT
WASHINGTON WAS ONE OF THAT KIND OF PEOPLE WHOSE HOPES ARE IN THE VERY CLOUDS ONE DAY AND IN THE GUTTER THE NEXT
BUT WHAT RUTH WROTE COULD A WOMAN DO TIED UP BY CUSTOM AND CAST INTO PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OUT OF WHICH IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTRICATE HERSELF
SHE WAS MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER
I AM INDEED
COME PLAY OUT YOUR JEST MISS HAWKINS
MEANTIME SENATOR DILWORTHY LABORED HARD IN THE SAME INTEREST--AND IN OTHERS OF EQUAL NATIONAL IMPORTANCE
BY AND BY THE DULL REPORT CAME AND HE WAS ABOUT TO WALK BACK MECHANICALLY AND SEE WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED
SHE HEARD THAT
PHILIP IS SHOWING APTITUDE FOR HIS PROFESSION
THIS CONTINUED THE COLONEL IN CONFIDENTIAL EXPLANATION WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO
NOT A WHISPER WAS UTTERED NOW BUT THE THREE MEN STARED AHEAD INTO THE SHADOWS AND TWO OF THEM SPUN THE WHEEL BACK AND FORTH WITH ANXIOUS WATCHFULNESS WHILE THE STEAMER TORE ALONG
IN OUR COUNTRY IT IS ALWAYS OUR FIRST CARE TO SEE THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF VOTING FOR THEIR CHOICE OF MEN TO REPRESENT AND GOVERN THEM--WE DO NOT PERMIT OUR GREAT OFFICIALS TO APPOINT THE LITTLE OFFICIALS
MRS SCHOONMAKER WAS AS NATURAL AND UNAFFECTED IN WASHINGTON SOCIETY AS SHE WAS IN HER OWN NEW YORK HOUSE AND KEPT UP THE SPIRIT OF HOME-LIFE THERE WITH HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN
SHE IS ENGAGED IN A VAST PHILANTHROPIC SCHEME FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE POOR BY THE USE OF THIS WEALTH
IT SCARED ME TO DEATH THE IDEA OF THIS FOOL STARTING A SMELTING FURNACE IN HIS HOUSE WITHOUT KNOWING IT AND GETTING HIS DULL EYES OPENED
AND YOU MIGHT CONCEIVE FROM HIS EXPRESSION AND HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE IS FINDING FAULT WITH THE WASHING
A CONCERT OF ACTION WAS NECESSARY AND HE WAS NOT THEREFORE AT ALL SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THE NOTE FROM A LADY ASKING HIM TO CALL AT SENATOR DILWORTHY'S
WHY NOT
HE MADE A PICTURE OF HIMSELF LIVING THERE A HERMIT IN A SHANTY BY THE TUNNEL DIGGING AWAY WITH SOLITARY PICK AND WHEELBARROW DAY AFTER DAY AND YEAR AFTER YEAR UNTIL HE GREW GRAY AND AGED AND WAS KNOWN IN ALL THAT REGION AS THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN
THE EXCITEMENT WAS FURIOUS
THERE ARE AS GOOD REASONS FOR BAD ACTIONS AS FOR GOOD ONES,--TO THOSE WHO COMMIT THEM
JUST ATTACH MY MACHINE TO THE WATER-PIPES ANYWHERE AND THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE FLUID BEGINS AND YOU WILL HAVE FLOODS OF LIGHT FOR THE MERE COST OF THE MACHINE
IT IS A CITY OF STEADY THRIFT THE ARMS OF WHICH MIGHT WELL BE THE DELIBERATE BUT DELICIOUS TERRAPIN THAT IMPARTS SUCH A ROYAL FLAVOR TO ITS FEASTS
STOVE WITH A CANDLE IN IT AND A TRANSPARENT DOOR--THAT'S IT--IT HAS BEEN THE SALVATION OF THIS FAMILY
HARRY TOOK AN ICE AND STOOD UP BY THE TABLE WITH OTHER GENTLEMEN AND LISTENED TO THE BUZZ OF CONVERSATION WHILE HE ATE
THE SENATOR WAS ASTOUNDED
HARRY INFORMED HIS NEW FRIEND THAT HE WAS GOING OUT WITH THE ENGINEER CORPS OF THE SALT LICK PACIFIC EXTENSION BUT THAT WASN'T HIS REAL BUSINESS
AND A LITTLE MORE WOULD CALM THE ANXIETY OF WASHINGTON HAWKINS ABOUT LAURA FOR HOWEVER THE TRIAL ENDED HE COULD FEEL SURE OF EXTRICATING HER IN THE END
IT IS AT LEAST RESPECTFUL TO SAY THAT THE INFLUENCES OF HOME LIFE ARE SWEET
COME LONG CHIL'EN TIME YOU'S GWYNE TO ROOS GO LONG WID YOU--OLE UNCLE DANIEL GWYNE OUT IN DE WOODS TO RASTLE IN PRAH--DE OLE NIGGER GWYNE TO DO WHAT HE KIN TO SABE YOU AGIN HE DID GO TO THE WOODS AND PRAY
STAND BY TO MEET HER GEORGE HAD THE WHEEL HARD DOWN AND WAS STANDING ON A SPOKE
AND IF I DID NOT KNOW IT BEFORE I KNOW NOW THAT THERE ARE SURER WAYS OF PLEASING HER THAN BY TRYING TO LIGHTEN HER LABOR WHEN THAT LABOR CONSISTS IN WEARING HERSELF OUT FOR THE SAKE OF A PERSON SHE LOVES A WEEK DRIFTED BY AND ALL THE WHILE THE PATIENT SANK LOWER AND LOWER
MRS GASHLY--"IS IT YOUR FIRST VISIT YES IT WAS HER FIRST
AND THEY'VE BUILT LITTLE DAMS AND SUCH THINGS WITH IT
BESIDES SAID MR THOMPSON SETTING IT DOWN IT PUTS EVERY MAN ON HIS HONOR AS TO QUANTITY EARLY TO TURN IN WAS THE RULE OF THE CAMP AND BY NINE O'CLOCK EVERYBODY WAS UNDER HIS BLANKET EXCEPT JEFF HIMSELF WHO WORKED AWHILE AT HIS TABLE OVER HIS FIELD-BOOK AND THEN AROSE STEPPED OUTSIDE THE TENT DOOR AND SANG IN A STRONG AND NOT UNMELODIOUS TENOR THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER FROM BEGINNING TO END
THAT THEY MUST THINK OF
WITHIN THREE DAYS A GENERAL TRANQUILITY AND SATISFACTION REIGNED IN THE HOUSEHOLD
IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS IT APPEARED THAT WHEREAS NO MEMBER OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE FAVORED THE SCHEME AT FIRST THERE WAS NOW NEEDED BUT ONE MORE VOTE TO COMPASS A MAJORITY REPORT
AND OTHERS PICTURED HER AS HIS WILLING PARAMOUR AND PITILESS SLAYER
SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT SEEING HIM
PERHAPS HE MEANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OCCASION TO SAY SOME VERY SERIOUS THINGS
THERE NOW--DOES THAT SATISFY YOU SPLENDID
CHAPTER XXXIX
SENATORS THIS CONVERSATION AND OTHERS LIKE IT CONTINUED WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE
WE LEVIED A TEN PER CENT
THE ROOM WAS WITHOUT LIGHT SAVE FROM THE STARS AND THE CANDLES THE GIRLS CARRIED WHICH REVEALED TO THEM DIMLY TWO LONG AND SEVERAL SMALL TABLES A FEW BENCHES AND CHAIRS A COUPLE OF SKELETONS HANGING ON THE WALL A SINK AND CLOTH-COVERED HEAPS OF SOMETHING UPON THE TABLES HERE AND THERE
               THE PRINCESS
IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME THAT YOU WANT IT SO
I SHALL BEGIN THE STUDY OF THE LAW
PRETTY FAIR JOKE--PRETTY FAIR
I'D NO IDEA WHAT SHE WAS DRAGGING ME INTO THAT CONFOUNDED HOTEL FOR
AT FIRST PHILIP WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE THE RESULT OF EVERY BLAST AND WAS ALWAYS BACK AND PEERING AMONG THE SMOKE THE MOMENT AFTER THE EXPLOSION
THE WINDOWS OF THAT WERE ALSO OPEN AND THROUGH THEM THEY HEARD THE SCREAM OF THE JIGGERED AND TORTURED VIOLIN AND THE PUMP PUMP OF THE OBOE AND SAW THE MOVING SHAPES OF MEN AND WOMEN IN QUICK TRANSITION AND HEARD THE PROMPTER'S DRAWL
BUT WHO CAN SAY IN THE BROADER VIEW AND THE MORE INTELLIGENT WEIGHT OF VALUES THAT THE LIFE OF ONE MAN IS NOT MORE THAN THAT OF A NATIONALITY AND THAT THERE IS NOT A TRIBUNAL WHERE THE TRAGEDY OF ONE HUMAN SOUL SHALL NOT SEEM MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THE OVERTURNING OF ANY HUMAN INSTITUTION WHATEVER
A HAND CAME OUT OCCASIONALLY FOR A PURPOSE BUT IT ALWAYS WENT BACK AGAIN AFTER SERVICE
SO SHE SUPPOSED SHE MUST HAVE SAT DOWN UPON THE SOFA AND AFTERWARD FALLEN
MR JEFF DAVIS WAS CONSTANTLY WRITING HIM TO TAKE COMMAND OF A CORPS IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY BUT COL
IN AN UNFORTUNATE HOUR HE HAD TWO OR THREE PAPERS ACCEPTED BY FIRST-CLASS MAGAZINES AT THREE DOLLARS THE PRINTED PAGE AND BEHOLD HIS VOCATION WAS OPEN TO HIM
IT WAS ALL TRUE THEN THE ROMANCES SHE HAD READ THE BLISS OF LOVE SHE HAD DREAMED OF
YOU MUST KNOW THEM WITHOUT DOUBT
I REMEMBER IT VERY WELL AND HURRICANES
IT WAS A JUST MEASURE
I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING PHILIP SHE SAID IF EVER RUTH BOLTON LOVES IT WILL BE WITH HER WHOLE SOUL IN A DEPTH OF PASSION THAT WILL SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT AND SURPRISE EVEN HERSELF A REMARK THAT DID NOT MUCH CONSOLE PHILIP WHO IMAGINED THAT ONLY SOME GRAND HEROISM COULD UNLOCK THE SWEETNESS OF SUCH A HEART
IT PASSES RIGHT AWAY
LAURA HANDED HIM HER COMMONPLACE-BOOK AND CALLED HIS ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE HANDWRITING THERE AND THE HANDWRITING OF THIS SPEECH WERE THE SAME
THAT'S COLUMBUS RIVER ONLY FORTY-NINE MILES TO THE MISSOURI
CROSS-EXAMINED
CROSS-EXAMINED
LAURA CALM AND FIRM AS A STATUE
PERHAPS THEY CAME TO WORSHIP HER RICHES BUT THEY REMAINED TO WORSHIP HER
IN THE EYES OF WASHINGTON HAWKINS HARRY WAS A SUPERIOR BEING A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO BRING THINGS TO PASS IN A WAY THAT EXCITED HIS ENTHUSIASM
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IN THE WORLD IS TO BECOME OF US A SHADE OF UNEASINESS CAME INTO HAWKINS'S FACE
A BLUFF JOVIAL BOST'N MAN THICK-SET CLOSE SHAVEN WITH A HEAVY JAW AND A LOW FOREHEAD--A VERY PLEASANT MAN IF YOU WERE NOT IN HIS WAY
WITH HIS TALENT HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN GETTING AN EDITORIAL POSITION UPON A METROPOLITAN NEWSPAPER
QUERY
AND THERE WAS A FERVENT HOPE THAT THE LAW WOULD TAKE ITS PLAIN COURSE
BUT IT WILL COME--NO FEAR OF THAT
MEET HER
IN REPLY TO MR BRAHAM'S QUESTION IF THE PRISONER DID NOT LOOK INSANE SUSAN SAID LORD
HE ARRIVED THE EVENING AFTER THIS CONVERSATION AND THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD GAVE HIM A RAPTUROUS WELCOME
THAT'S THE PLACE FOR THE PUBLIC SQUARE COURT HOUSE HOTELS CHURCHES JAIL--ALL THAT SORT OF THING
WE HAD MADE THEM FREE
THEN HE SAID
THEN HE SAID
THEN HE SAID
THEN HE SAID
AFTER A TIME THERE WERE NO SOUNDS BUT THE CRIES OF THE MOURNERS WITHIN AND THE GUSTY TURMOIL OF THE WIND WITHOUT
RUBBISH WAS SCATTERED ABOUT THE GRASSLESS YARD
IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR THE BORROWER TO RECEIVE THE MONEY WITHOUT MAKING A MEMORANDUM OF IT OR GIVING A NOTE OR A RECEIPT FOR IT'S USE--THE BORROWER IS NOT LIKELY TO DIE OR FORGET ABOUT IT
NOW I AM SURE YOU WILL BE GENEROUS TO THE POOR NEGRO AND VOTE FOR THAT BILL YES I FEEL MORE TENDERLY TOWARD THE OPPRESSED COLORED MAN THAN I DID
UPON THE TABLE STOOD A VASE OF FLOWERS
MR SELLERS
THEY WERE CAMPED ON THE SECOND BENCH OF THE NARROW BOTTOM OF A CROOKED SLUGGISH STREAM THAT WAS SOME FIVE RODS WIDE IN THE PRESENT GOOD STAGE OF WATER
AND WE'LL LAY THIS FORK REPRESENTING THE RAILROAD FROM ST LOUIS TO THIS POTATO WHICH IS SLOUCHBURG
THE FIRST WAS FROM BRAHAM AND RAN THUS
INDUSTRY AND ECONOMY SOON ENABLED HIM TO START A LOW RUM SHOP IN A FOUL LOCALITY AND THIS GAVE HIM POLITICAL INFLUENCE
IT'S AS EASY AS LYING
WITH CHARACTERISTIC TREACHERY THE TRUCKLING AND PUSILLANIMOUS REPTILE CRIPPLED-SPEECH TROLLOP HAS GONE OVER TO THE ENEMY
ITS MOST ENERGETIC ENEMIES SAID IT WAS USELESS TO FIGHT LONGER
RUTH ASSISTED THE SURGEON WITH THE UTMOST COOLNESS AND WITH SKILLFUL HANDS HELPED TO DRESS PHILIP'S WOUNDS
HE WOULD SAY GOOD-NIGHT BUT NOT GOOD-BYE
GOOD FRIENDS THE TWO GIRLS WERE FROM THE BEGINNING
BY THE TERMS OF OUR INSTRUCTIONS WE CAN NOW PROCEED TO METE OUT TO HIM SUCH PUNISHMENT AS IS MEET FOR ONE WHO HAS MALICIOUSLY BROUGHT DISRESPECT UPON A SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES
A LETTER THAT--I'LL READ YOU A LINE FROM IT HE FLEW OUT OF THE ROOM
MR BIGLER IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEN IN THE STATE
HE SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT HE ONLY WANTED A WORD WITH YOU CONTINUED LAURA
IT WAS LOST
THE STONE FLOOR IS LIKE ICE
HE OFFERED $10,000 FOR OUR LAND AND THANK THE GOOD PROVIDENCE FROM THE VERY BOTTOM OF MY HEART OF HEARTS
NOW AND THEN HE ACCOMPANIED HER TO SOME RECEPTION AND RARELY ON OFF NIGHTS HE WAS BLESSED WITH HER COMPANY IN THE PARLOR WHEN HE SANG AND WAS CHATTY AND VIVACIOUS AND PERFORMED A HUNDRED LITTLE TRICKS OF IMITATION AND VENTRILOQUISM AND MADE HIMSELF AS ENTERTAINING AS A MAN COULD BE
IT WAS A GRIEVOUS TEMPTATION BUT THE JUDGE WITHSTOOD IT
YOU WERE DULY ELECTED TO THESE PLACES AND YOU ACCEPTED THEM
S.--WE HAVE FOUND COAL THE NEWS COULDN'T HAVE COME TO MR BOLTON IN BETTER TIME
IT WAS THE ORIGINAL UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU AND MR SELLERS WERE TO HAVE THE POSITIONS YOU NOW HOLD WITH SALARIES OF $600 A MONTH EACH WHILE IN ACTIVE SERVICE
HE IMMEDIATELY BENT HIS STEPS TOWARD HOME
IT IS SAID THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL REPORT THE BILL BACK TO-MORROW
CONVINCING THE REASON WITHOUT TOUCHING THE FEELINGS
LAURA WAS VERY PALE BUT THIS PALLOR HEIGHTENED THE LUSTRE OF HER LARGE EYES AND GAVE A TOUCHING SADNESS TO HER EXPRESSIVE FACE
I AND A PERSON WHOM WE WILL CALL MISS BLANK NEVER MIND THE REAL NAME WERE IN A CLOSET AT YOUR ELBOW ALL THE WHILE MR TROLLOP WINCED--THEN HE SAID WITH DIGNITY
THEIR NAMES WILL BE KNOWN FROM OCEAN TO OCEAN
IN THE BARROOM HE WAS THE CONCILIATORY LANDLORD
SKINNED THE CAT ON THE HOG-CHAINS
HE WAS ESTABLISHED IN COMFORTABLE QUARTERS AND IF SHE COULD FIND COMPANY AND JOIN HIM THEY WOULD BE MARRIED AND GAIN SO MANY MORE MONTHS OF HAPPINESS
THE PUBLIC OUTSIDE HOPED FOR A CONVICTION AS IT ALWAYS DOES
DID HE ACCOMPANY HER TO A RECEPTION AT MRS SHOONMAKER'S A DAY OR TWO BEFORE
IS THERE A BEAUTY IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF EVIL A BEAUTY THAT SHINES OUT IN THE FACE OF A PERSON WHOSE INWARD LIFE IS TRANSFORMED BY SOME TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME WHETHER I WOULD OR NOT WAS THE UNEMBARRASSED REPLY
IT SEEMED TO HIM ALSO THAT HE HAD BEEN ONE CAUSE OF THE MISFORTUNE TO THE BOLTON FAMILY AND THAT HE WAS DRAGGING INTO LOSS AND RUIN EVERYBODY WHO ASSOCIATED WITH HIM
HOW ALL WASHINGTON WOULD GATHER UP ITS VIRTUOUS SKIRTS AND AVOID ME IF IT KNEW
I SUPPOSE I DID ASK YOU DIDN'T I NO MA'M,--BUT I YES I MUST HAVE DONE IT ELSE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE OFFERED YOUR SERVICES FOR FEAR IT MIGHT BE RUDE
ALONE OF ALL THEIR CHILDREN SHE WAS IMPATIENT OF THE RESTRAINTS AND MONOTONY OF THE FRIENDS SOCIETY AND WHOLLY INDISPOSED TO ACCEPT THE INNER LIGHT AS A GUIDE INTO A LIFE OF ACCEPTANCE AND INACTION
IT TURNS OUT TO BE ONLY A MERE SEAM HE WROTE BUT WE LOOK UPON IT AS AN INDICATION OF BETTER FURTHER IN ALAS
YOU HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR TWO-THIRDS OF THE SESSION NEXT THEY WILL TRY EACH OTHER FOR VARIOUS SMALLER IRREGULARITIES LIKE THE SALE OF APPOINTMENTS TO WEST POINT CADETSHIPS AND THAT SORT OF THING--MERE TRIFLING POCKET-MONEY ENTERPRISES THAT MIGHT BETTER BE PASSED OVER IN SILENCE PERHAPS BUT THEN ONE OF OUR CONGRESSES CAN NEVER REST EASY TILL IT HAS THOROUGHLY PURIFIED ITSELF OF ALL BLEMISHES--AND THAT IS A THING TO BE APPLAUDED HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO DISINFECT ITSELF OF THESE MINOR IMPURITIES WELL ABOUT TWO WEEKS GENERALLY SO CONGRESS ALWAYS LIES HELPLESS IN QUARANTINE TEN WEEKS OF A SESSION
SHE WAS A HEROINE NOW WITH A MYSTERIOUS FATHER SOMEWHERE
THE COLUMBUS RIVER NAVIGATION SCHEME WAS GOT THROUGH ALMOST ENTIRELY BY HIS AID
THE CORRESPONDENCE WAS NOT VERY BRISK BETWEEN THESE TWO YOUNG PERSONS SO DIFFERENTLY OCCUPIED
THAT WILL TAKE ANOTHER FOUR WEEKS VERY GOOD
FAIRMINDED PEOPLE DECLINED TO CONDEMN HER ON MERE SUSPICION AND SO THE INJURIOUS TALK MADE NO VERY DAMAGING HEADWAY
YOU MIGHT AS WELL BASE IT ON PORK
HE SAID IT WOULD BE HAPPINESS ENOUGH TO LOOK UPON HER FACE ONCE MORE--IT WOULD BE ALMOST TOO MUCH HAPPINESS WHEN TO IT WAS ADDED THE FACT THAT SHE WOULD BRING MESSAGES WITH HER THAT WERE FRESH FROM LOUISE'S LIPS
I WISH FATHER WERE HERE AND WERE HIS OLD SELF AGAIN--OH HE NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD SUCH CHANCES AS THESE ARE
THESE UNFORTUNATES FOLLOWED LAURA HELPLESSLY FOR WHENEVER SHE TOOK A PRISONER HE REMAINED HER SLAVE HENCEFORTH
SOME DAY WHEN YOU AND I ARE IN OUR GRAVES THERE'LL BE A RAILROAD STRETCHING HUNDREDS OF MILES--ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM THE CITIES OF THE NORTHERN STATES TO NEW ORLEANS--AND ITS GOT TO RUN WITHIN THIRTY MILES OF THIS LAND--MAY BE EVEN TOUCH A CORNER OF IT
A RAILROAD COME HERE LAST SUMMER BUT IT HAINT BEEN HERE NO MO YES SIR THE COLONEL HASTENED TO EXPLAIN IN THE OLD RECORDS COLUMBUS RIVER IS CALLED GOOSE RUN
THE CHILDREN HAD RUSHED INTO THE PARLOR AND ROLLED THEMSELVES IN THEIR FATHER'S BLOOD
SHE WAS ABOUT TO ASK HER MOTHER IF THERE WAS ANY TRUTH IN THESE REPORTS BUT UPON SECOND THOUGHT HELD HER PEACE
HENRY BRIERLY PART 7
WE HAVE VIEW'D IT AND MEASUR'D IT WITHIN ALL BY THE SCALE THE RICHEST TRACT OF LAND LOVE IN THE KINGDOM
I BELIEVE I WOULD BEGIN ATTENDING LECTURES THIS WINTER IF IT WEREN'T FOR BEING WANTED IN WASHINGTON
I'D RATHER OPERATE ON MY OWN HOOK SAID HARRY IN HIS MOST AIRY MANNER
TWO THOUSAND--THIS WAS FINE INDEED
THEREFORE HE WANTED THE SENATOR TRIED AND NOT IN THE USUAL NAMBY-PAMBY WAY BUT IN GOOD EARNEST
THEY'LL BE COURTED AND WORSHIPED
EVEN IN THESE DAYS WHEN PEOPLE GROWL SO MUCH AND THE NEWSPAPERS ARE SO OUT OF PATIENCE THERE IS STILL A VERY RESPECTABLE MINORITY OF HONEST MEN IN CONGRESS WHY A RESPECTABLE MINORITY OF HONEST MEN CAN'T DO ANY GOOD COLONEL OH YES IT CAN TOO WHY HOW OH IN MANY WAYS MANY WAYS BUT WHAT ARE THE WAYS WELL--I DON'T KNOW--IT IS A QUESTION THAT REQUIRES TIME
AND SHE PROMISED SHE WOULD LET HIM ALONE HE ONLY STOPPED TO SEND A NOTE TO SENATOR DILWORTHY TELLING HIM WHAT HE HAD FOUND AND THAT HE SHOULD GO AT ONCE TO NEW YORK AND THEN HASTENED TO THE RAILWAY STATION
AND BEFORE THE ENGINEERS HAD FINISHED THEIR BREAKFAST THEY WERE THE OBJECT OF THE CURIOUS INSPECTION OF SIX OR EIGHT BOYS AND MEN WHO LOUNGED INTO THE CAMP AND GAZED ABOUT THEM WITH LANGUID INTEREST THEIR HANDS IN THEIR POCKETS EVERY ONE
OH WHY DIDN'T I SAY FIFTY THOUSAND HE PLUNGED HIS HANDS INTO HIS HAIR AND LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES AND FELL TO ROCKING HIMSELF BACK AND FORTH IN ANGUISH
YOU MAKE YOURSELF PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE OLD LADY AND YOU'LL SEE HOW WE'LL TROT THIS RIGHT ALONG
THEY CAME OVER TO MASSACHUSETTS BAY IN ANOTHER VESSEL AND THUS ESCAPED THE ONUS OF THAT BREVET NOBILITY UNDER WHICH THE SUCCESSORS OF THE MAYFLOWER PILGRIMS HAVE DESCENDED
AS PHILIP SAT HOLDING HER WEAK HAND AND WATCHING THE LEAST SIGN OF RESOLUTION IN HER FACE RUTH WAS ABLE TO WHISPER I SO WANT TO LIVE FOR YOU PHIL YOU WILL
THERE WERE NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN ATTENDANTS ON THE LECTURES ALL TOGETHER SO THAT THE ENTERPRISE HAD THE AIR OF AN EXPERIMENT AND THE FASCINATION OF PIONEERING FOR THOSE ENGAGED IN IT
BEING OBLIGED TO SAY SOMETHING HE WOULD MINE HIS BRAIN AND PUT IN A BLAST AND WHEN THE SMOKE AND FLYING DEBRIS HAD CLEARED AWAY THE RESULT WOULD BE WHAT SEEMED TO HIM BUT A POOR LITTLE INTELLECTUAL CLOD OF DIRT OR TWO AND THEN HE WOULD BE ASTONISHED TO SEE EVERYBODY AS LOST IN ADMIRATION AS IF HE HAD BROUGHT UP A TON OR TWO OF VIRGIN GOLD
WHETHER MEDICINE IS A SCIENCE OR ONLY AN EMPIRICAL METHOD OF GETTING A LIVING OUT OF THE IGNORANCE OF THE HUMAN RACE RUTH FOUND BEFORE HER FIRST TERM WAS OVER AT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL THAT THERE WERE OTHER THINGS SHE NEEDED TO KNOW QUITE AS MUCH AS THAT WHICH IS TAUGHT IN MEDICAL BOOKS AND THAT SHE COULD NEVER SATISFY HER ASPIRATIONS WITHOUT MORE GENERAL CULTURE
YOU'LL HAVE LAURA AGAIN AND--LOUISE AND YOUR MOTHER AND OCEANS AND OCEANS OF MONEY--AND THEN YOU CAN GO AWAY EVER SO FAR AWAY SOMEWHERE IF YOU WANT TO AND FORGET ALL ABOUT THIS INFERNAL PLACE
I'LL BE EVER SO CAREFUL
WHAT SOME OF THE JOURNALS LACKED IN SUITABLE LENGTH FOR THE OCCASION THEY MADE UP IN ENCYCLOPAEDIC INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER SIMILAR MURDERS AND SHOOTINGS
MRS OLIVER HIGGINS THE HON
MAY BE THREE MAY BE FOUR SAID THE COLONEL IT'S WORTH MORE THAN THE BANK OF ENGLAND IF THEY WILL NOT LEASE SAID WASHINGTON LET EM MAKE IT TWO MILLIONS FOR AN UNDIVIDED HALF
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT
BUT TIM PERSISTED AND THEN PHILIP SAID HE HAD A LITTLE PROVISION NOW AND WOULD SHARE
IT IS THAT INSTANT WHEN THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY STANDS UP TO GIVE THE VERDICT AND BEFORE HE HAS OPENED HIS FATEFUL LIPS
SELLERS WOULD HAVE SOMETHING
YOU WILL OFFEND ME BY REPEATING SUCH AN OBSERVATION HE SAID
INSTANTLY THE FICKLE YOUTH'S DREAMS FORSOOK THE MAGIC EYE-WATER AND FLEW BACK TO THE TENNESSEE LAND
IF THE READER VISITS THE VILLAGE TO-DAY HE WILL DOUBTLESS BE POINTED OUT THE MONTAGUE DWELLING WHERE RUTH LIVED THE CROSS-LOTS PATH SHE TRAVERSED TO THE SEMINARY AND THE VENERABLE CHAPEL WITH ITS CRACKED BELL
WASHINGTON IS AN INTERESTING CITY TO ANY OF US
PROMPTNESS IS A VIRTUE MR TROLLOP AND I PERCEIVE THAT YOU HAVE IT
A FEW CRIED
CHAPTER XIII
YET THIS WAS TRUE OF PHILIP THAT IN WHATEVER COMPANY HE HAD BEEN HE HAD NEVER BEEN ASHAMED TO STAND UP FOR THE PRINCIPLES HE LEARNED FROM HIS MOTHER AND NEITHER RAILLERY NOR LOOKS OF WONDER TURNED HIM FROM THAT DAILY HABIT HE HAD LEARNED AT HIS MOTHER'S KNEES.--EVEN FLIPPANT HARRY RESPECTED THIS AND PERHAPS IT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HARRY AND ALL WHO KNEW PHILIP TRUSTED HIM IMPLICITLY
SO HAD I
SOMETIMES A BODY CAN'T TELL WHEDDER YOU'S A SAYIN WHAT YOU MEANS OR WHEDDER YOU'S A SAYIN WHAT YOU DON'T MEAN CASE YOU SAYS EM BOFE DE SAME WAY BUT HOW SHOULD I KNOW WHETHER THEY WERE BOYS OR GIRLS GOODNESS SAKES MARS CLAY DON'T DE GOOD BOOK SAY
SINCE THIS YOUNG FELLOW WENT OUT INTO THE WORLD FROM HIS NEW ENGLAND HOME HE HAD DONE SOME THINGS THAT HE WOULD RATHER HIS MOTHER SHOULD NOT KNOW THINGS MAYBE THAT HE WOULD SHRINK FROM TELLING RUTH
FOR THE COLONEL RAISED UP THE FLAP LOOKED IN FRONT AND BEHIND AND THEN EXCLAIMED CONFOUND IT
ONE CANNOT BE FASTIDIOUS ABOUT MINOR MATTERS WHEN ONE HAS NO CHOICE THE VISIT HAD SPUN OUT NEARLY THREE MINUTES NOW
IS IT SOME OTHER VAIN BRILLIANT BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE OF SOUL-STAINING AMUSEMENT AND HILARITY
GO FOR A SUSPENSION OF THE RULES
WE PLAYED FOR A BIG THING AND LOST IT AND I DON'T WHINE FOR ONE
HE WON'T LET ME GO TO A HOTEL WHEN I'M IN THE CITY--SAYS I'M THE ONLY MAN THAT'S COMPANY TO HIM AND I DON'T KNOW BUT THERE'S SOME TRUTH IN IT TOO BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I NEVER LIKE TO GLORIFY MYSELF AND MAKE A GREAT TO-DO OVER WHAT I AM OR WHAT I CAN DO OR WHAT I KNOW I DON'T MIND SAYING HERE AMONG FRIENDS THAT I AM BETTER READ UP IN MOST SCIENCES MAYBE THAN THE GENERAL RUN OF PROFESSIONAL MEN IN THESE DAYS
MR SMALL ALSO CAME WITH A SIMILAR STORY ABOUT MR BIGLER
SHE CAUGHT HIS ARM AND CRIED GEORGE HOW CAN YOU JOKE SO CRUELLY
WELL I'LL BE DASHED WAS HEARD THE CHEERY VOICE OF MR THOMPSON AS HE STEPPED OUTSIDE THE TENT DOOR AT SUNRISE NEXT MORNING
STILL IN THE DISTANCE BUT ON THIS SIDE OF THE WATER AND CLOSE TO ITS EDGE THE MONUMENT TO THE FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY TOWERS OUT OF THE MUD--SACRED SOIL IS THE CUSTOMARY TERM
I'LL GO RIGHT AFTER HIM
SHE WAS PENSIVE THE NEXT DAY AND SUBDUED
NAMELY YOU EITHER KNEW THAT THE IDEA OF ALL THIS PREPOSTEROUS GENEROSITY WAS TO BRIBE YOU INTO FUTURE LEGISLATIVE FRIENDSHIP OR YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT
IT WAS COVERED WITH FORESTS AND STRANGE PLANTS
YOU WERE BOSS
THE WHICH IN EVERY LANGUAGE I PRONOUNCE STUFFING THE EARS OF MEN WITH FALSE REPORTS
THIS VILE DIRTY EFFORT TO ROB THE PUBLIC TREASURY BY THE KITES AND VULTURES THAT NOW INFEST THE FILTHY DEN CALLED CONGRESS'--THAT IS ADMIRABLE ADMIRABLE
AND BESIDES IF I HAD BEEN INCLINED TO FORGET I--DID YOU NOT GIVE ME SOMETHING BY WAY OF A REMEMBRANCER DID I THINK IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT I DID
SHE DON'T DARE TACKLE IT!"--MEANING THE AMARANTH
A JOKE EVEN IF IT BE A LAME ONE IS NO WHERE SO KEENLY RELISHED OR QUICKLY APPLAUDED AS IN A MURDER TRIAL
AND SHE WAS FILLED WITH GRATIFICATION TO DISCOVER THAT SHE ON THE CONTRARY WAS MAKING A GOOD MANY SHREWD SPEECHES AND NOW AND THEN A REALLY BRILLIANT ONE AND FURTHERMORE THAT THEY WERE BEGINNING TO BE REPEATED IN SOCIAL CIRCLES ABOUT THE TOWN
HAS A CONFESSOR IF SHE IS YOUNG AND PRETTY ANY FEELING
HE HAS A QUIXOTIC NOTION THAT YOU WOULD TURN BACK FROM WHAT IS BEFORE YOU FOR HIS SAKE
WE HAVE DR SHOVEL NOW
THE GENERAL HELD SIMILAR VIEWS
YOU ARE SO KIND THAT I KNOW YOU WILL PARDON MY PUTTING YOU TO THE TROUBLE TO COME THIS EVENING INDEED IT WAS NO TROUBLE
IF IT'S WASH HASTINGS--WELL WHAT HE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE RIVER AIN'T WORTH KNOWING--A REGULAR GOLD-LEAF KID-GLOVE DIAMOND BREASTPIN PILOT WASH HASTINGS IS
AN UGLY WOMAN WOULD RUIN ME THE DISEASE WOULD BE SURE TO STRIKE IN AND KILL ME AT SIGHT OF HER
WHAT WOULD I CARE FOR THE TALK THAT THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ABOUT ME WHEN I WAS GONE TO EUROPE WITH SELBY AND ALL THE WORLD WAS BUSY WITH MY HISTORY AND MY DISHONOR
TWO GENTLEMEN WHO HAD JUST COME IN HAD SEIZED THE LADY WHO MADE NO RESISTANCE AND SHE WAS AT ONCE GIVEN IN CHARGE OF A POLICE OFFICER WHO ARRIVED
ANGRY SHE SAID FORCING HERSELF TO COME BACK TO HIS PRESENCE
HALF THE BUILDING WAS STORE AND HALF WAS DWELLING HOUSE
SHE WAS SO IMPATIENT THAT THE SECOND-HAND SEEMED WHOLE TEDIOUS MINUTES DRAGGING ITS WAY AROUND THE CIRCLE
THIS IS SUFFICIENT AND CONCLUSIVE
MAKE FREE CHOICE
WELL IT IS A GOOD NIGHT'S WORK
IN SPITE OF ALL HER BRAVE EFFORTS HER FREQUENT CORRESPONDENCE AND HER DETERMINED ANIMATION HER BOOKS AND HER MUSIC SHE FOUND HERSELF SETTLING INTO THE CLUTCHES OF THE OLD MONOTONY AND AS SHE REALIZED THE HOPELESSNESS OF HER ENDEAVORS THE MEDICAL SCHEME TOOK NEW HOLD OF HER AND SEEMED TO HER THE ONLY METHOD OF ESCAPE
I DON'T ENTIRELY LIKE THE TONE OF SOME OF THESE REMARKS
SUCH HIGH-BRED NEGLIGENCE AND UNCONSCIOUSNESS
SENATOR DILWORTHY ROSE AND BEAMED UPON THE ASSEMBLAGE FOR A FULL MINUTE IN SILENCE
HE WAS SHY NOT SHY CHILD CAUTIOUS
SHE WAS CONSPICUOUS AT THE BALLS OF THE FASTEST SET AND WAS SUSPECTED OF BEING PRESENT AT THOSE DOUBTFUL SUPPERS THAT BEGAN LATE AND ENDED EARLY
THEY HAPPENED JUST AS THEY ARE TOLD.--THE AUTHORS CHAPTER V
THE NIGHT WAS FAR SPENT AND A DEAD STILLNESS REIGNED
HE WAS FAR ON HIS FLIGHT EASTWARD AND WELL OUT OF DANGER WHEN THE NEXT MORNING DAWNED
MR BRAHAM SAID IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY
THE CELL WAS SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN THOSE IN THE MEN'S DEPARTMENT AND MIGHT BE EIGHT FEET BY TEN SQUARE PERHAPS A LITTLE LONGER
NO I DON'T FEEL AT HOME THERE THAT EVENING RUTH AND HER FATHER SAT LATE BY THE DRAWING-ROOM FIRE AS THEY WERE QUITE APT TO DO AT NIGHT
I'LL NEVER SEND ANYTHING MORE BY EM
THE LAWYERS SUDDENLY STOPPED AND THEY AND THE JUDGE TURNED TOWARDS THE COLONEL AND REMAINED FOR SEVERAL SECONDS TOO SURPRISED AT THIS NOVEL EXHIBITION TO SPEAK
WOMEN ALWAYS HAVE
NO SAID PHILIP THE CHANCES ARE THAT A MAN CANNOT GET INTO CONGRESS NOW WITHOUT RESORTING TO ARTS AND MEANS THAT SHOULD RENDER HIM UNFIT TO GO THERE
WE'D COUNTED ON THE YEAR OF SIMON'S RE-ELECTION
HE SEIZED HIS HAT AND SAYING THAT HE WOULD GO AND SEE WHAT HE COULD LEARN RAN TO THE LODGINGS OF HARRY
HIS LOST MEMORY RETURNS TO HIM WHEN HE IS DELIRIOUS AND GOES AWAY AGAIN WHEN HE IS HIMSELF-JUST AS OLD CANADA JOE USED TO TALK THE FRENCH PATOIS OF HIS BOYHOOD IN THE DELIRIUM OF TYPHUS FEVER THOUGH HE COULD NOT DO IT WHEN HIS MIND WAS CLEAR
LORD BLESS ME YOU'LL LOVE HER--YOU'LL DOTE ON HER--YOU'LL BE TWINS
THERE WERE MANY REASONS FOR A DELAY REASONS WHICH OF COURSE ARE NEVER MENTIONED BUT WHICH IT WOULD SEEM THAT A NEW YORK JUDGE SOMETIMES MUST UNDERSTAND WHEN HE GRANTS A POSTPONEMENT UPON A MOTION THAT SEEMS TO THE PUBLIC ALTOGETHER INADEQUATE
THEN THEY LOOKED WISTFULLY UP AT THE PILOT HOUSE AND FINALLY LITTLE BY LITTLE CLAY VENTURED UP THERE FOLLOWED DIFFIDENTLY BY WASHINGTON
DEEP DEVIL
THE REVULSION WAS TERRIBLE
THEN HE WOULD GO AWAY HATING AND CURSING THE WHOLE SEX AND SHE WOULD CALMLY ADD HIS SCALP TO HER STRING WHILE SHE MUSED UPON THE BITTER DAY THAT COL
SELBY OF COWARDICE
IN THE FIRST PLACE RUTH WAS OVERTAXING HER STRENGTH IN HER HOSPITAL LABORS AND PHILIP FELT AS IF HE MUST MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO SAVE HER FROM SUCH TOIL AND SUFFERING
THE ENGINEERS CAMP WAS ONLY TWO OR THREE MILES DISTANT
LET'S COMMENCE RIGHT AWAY--LET'S 1,000,000 BOTTLES IN THE UNITED STATES--PROFIT AT LEAST $350,000--AND THEN IT WOULD BEGIN TO BE TIME TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TOWARD THE REAL IDEA OF THE BUSINESS THE REAL IDEA OF IT
IT SET FORTH LAURA'S THREATS BUT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT ADDITION TO IT WHICH THE NEWSPAPER REPORT DID NOT HAVE
AND FROM THESE LETTERS IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT HARRY WAS A PET WITH ALL WASHINGTON AND WAS LIKELY TO CARRY THE THING THROUGH
THEY WERE HUNG WITH JEWELS--CHIEFLY DIAMONDS
EVERYBODY KNOWS THE APPROPRIATION'S BEEN MADE AND THE COMPANY'S PERFECTLY GOOD SO THE ORDERS WERE GIVEN AND THE MEN APPEASED THOUGH THEY GRUMBLED A LITTLE AT FIRST
SELLERS HAD IN ALL PROBABILITY BY THIS TIME SOME OTHER EQUALLY BRILLIANT SPECULATION IN HIS BRAIN
SHE WAS ENTIRELY SELF-POSSESSED AND BEYOND UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT DID NOT ACT UNNATURALLY
BUT THE ORATORS ADD STATESMEN WHO WERE THE PURCHASERS OF THE FAVORS OF THE ONE MAY HAVE BEEN AS INCORRUPTIBLE AS THE REPUBLICAN STATESMEN WHO LEARNED HOW TO LOVE AND HOW TO VOTE FROM THE SWEET LIPS OF THE WASHINGTON LOBBYIST
WELL MAYBE
WHAT IS SHE-CARRYING NOW A HUNDRED AND SIXTY-FIVE SIR HOW'S YOUR WOOD PINE ALL OUT-CYPRESS HALF GONE-EATING UP COTTON-WOOD LIKE PIE BREAK INTO THAT ROSIN ON THE MAIN DECK-PILE IT IN THE BOAT CAN PAY FOR IT SOON THE BOAT WAS PLUNGING AND QUIVERING AND SCREAMING MORE MADLY THAN EVER
THAT IS THE PATH OF RIGHTEOUSNESS THOUGH AFTER IT BUT FEW INQUIRES
THE SQUIRE REMAINED AND READ HIS LETTER
IT MAY MATTER LITTLE TO YOU
SOME PEOPLE HAVE THIS INFLUENCE WHICH IS LIKE AN EMANATION
WHICH LEAVES YOU IN DEBT TO THE COMPANY FOR THE OTHER SEVEN-EIGHTHS OF THE ASSESSMENT--VIZ SOMETHING OVER $8,000 APIECE
THEY SUPPLIED ALL THE MISSING INFORMATION THEMSELVES THEY FILLED UP ALL THE BLANKS
SEND HIM UP MR GRILLER ENTERED
CONGRESS HAS INFLICTED FRIGHTFUL PUNISHMENTS ON ITS MEMBERS--NOW YOU KNOW THAT
IT WAS INDIGESTION YOU KNOW AND IT LOOKS AS IF IT WAS CHRONIC
BUT THEY HAD NOT FORGOTTEN
AND PROLONGED HIS VISIT DAY AFTER DAY GREATLY TO THE DETRIMENT OF HIS BUSINESS BOTH IN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON
WELL MY PRAYER WAS ANSWERED
AND WRITE TO CLAY ABOUT IT IF HE IS NOT WITH YOU YET
SELLERS WAS AND THAT THE WORLD WOULD OPEN ITS EYES WHEN IT FOUND OUT
HOW CAME YOU HERE
HIS ARM WAS SET AND HIS HEAD DRESSED AND THE SURGEON SAID HE WOULD COME ROUND ALL RIGHT IN HIS MIND BY MORNING
BUT AFTER ALL WAS THAT THE BEST WAY
MR TROLLOP YOU ARE PLEDGED TO SUPPORT THE INDIGENT CONGRESSMEN'S RETROACTIVE APPROPRIATION WHICH IS TO COME UP EITHER IN THIS OR THE NEXT SESSION
TOWARD EVENING THE STAGE-COACH CAME THUNDERING INTO HAWKEYE WITH A PERFECTLY TRIUMPHANT OSTENTATION--WHICH WAS NATURAL AND PROPER FOR HAWKEY A WAS A PRETTY LARGE TOWN FOR INTERIOR MISSOURI
LET THE SERGEANT-AT ARMS INFORM THE GENTLEMAN THAT HIS CONDUCT IS AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE DIGNITY OF THE HOUSE--AND ONE WHICH IS NOT WARRANTED BY THE STATE OF THE WEATHER POOR SELLERS WAS THE CULPRIT
ALWAYS COOL
I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO LOSE HIM IF WE DON'T MAKE A CHANGE MRS O
IT SCORCHED THE CLOTHES IT SINGED THE HAIR OF THE AXEMEN--IT DROVE THEM BACK FOOT BY FOOT--INCH BY INCH--THEY WAVERED STRUCK A FINAL BLOW IN THE TEETH OF THE ENEMY AND SURRENDERED
SHE HAD JUST BEEN WRITING TO RUTH AND ON THE TABLE BEFORE HER WAS A YELLOW PIECE OF PAPER WITH A FADED FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER PINNED ON IT--ONLY A MEMORY NOW
AND NO MATTER WHAT THE RESULT IS WE MUST FULFILL OUR DUTY BY THIS BEING I'D ELEVATE HIS SOUL PROMPTLY RESPONDED THE COLONEL
THE TRAIN WAS SWINGING ALONG AT A RAPID RATE JARRING FROM SIDE TO SIDE
HE BEGAN TO EXAGGERATE HIS HERETOFORE SIMPLE CONVERSATION TO SUIT THE NEWSPAPER DEMAND
THAT NOTION HE GOT UP HERE DID LOOK AS HANDY AS ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
DILWORTHY RECEIVING NOT ONE VOTE
BEFORE WE CAME TO WASHINGTON I THOUGHT REBELS WOULD LOOK UNLIKE OTHER PEOPLE
EVERY EFFORT HAD BEEN MADE TO SECURE THE REFUSAL OF THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF THE PROPERTY OF THE HAWKINS HEIRS IN THE KNOBS SOME SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND ACRES MR BUCKSTONE SAID
HE WAS NOT AN EXACTING MAN
THE SELLERS FAMILY WERE JUST STARTING TO DINNER WHEN WASHINGTON BURST UPON THEM WITH HIS SURPRISE
THE FAMILY FOUGHT SHY OF THE QUESTIONINGS AND OF COURSE THAT WAS HIGH TESTIMONY IF THE DUCHESS WAS RESPECTABLY BORN WHY DIDN'T THEY COME OUT AND PROVE IT?--WHY DID THEY STICK TO THAT POOR THIN STORY ABOUT PICKING HER UP OUT OF A STEAMBOAT EXPLOSION UNDER THIS CEASELESS PERSECUTION LAURA'S MORBID SELF-COMMUNING WAS RENEWED
AND SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM WITH A THREATENING MIEN
BUT BALLOON KNEW THEIR NEEDS BETTER
HE HAD A MIDNIGHT INTERVIEW WITH HIM AND URGED HIM TO FORSAKE HIS EVIL WAYS
HE'LL MAKE ANYBODY BELIEVE IN THAT NOTION THAT'LL LISTEN TO HIM TEN MINUTES--WHY I DO BELIEVE HE WOULD MAKE A DEAF AND DUMB MAN BELIEVE IN IT AND GET BESIDE HIMSELF IF YOU ONLY SET HIM WHERE HE COULD SEE HIS EYES TALLY AND WATCH HIS HANDS EXPLAIN
IT IS TOO FLIMSY MISS HAWKINS FOR A PERSON OF YOUR FINE INVENTIVE TALENT--CONTRIVE AN ABLER DEVICE THAN THAT
THEY GENERALLY SUPPORTED MEASURES WHEN IT WAS POSSIBLE
NANCY YOU'VE HEARD OF STEAMBOATS AND MAYBE YOU BELIEVED IN THEM--OF COURSE YOU DID
HIS HAIR WAS ALREADY TURNING GRAY WHEN THE LATE SESSION OF CONGRESS BEGAN ITS SITTINGS
OH
OH
HE WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A BAD JUROR THOUGH WHISPERED BRAHAM
THERE'S OLD BALSAM WAS IN THE INTERIOR--USED TO BE THE REV
OLD MCDOWELLS WOULDN'T LIKE ME TO--TO--BOTHER IT ALL I'LL JEST TELL THE WHOLE THING AND LET IT GO
ABOUT WHERE WE STAND THE DEEPO
LAURA WELCOMED MR TROLLOP A GRAVE CAREFULLY DRESSED AND VERY RESPECTABLE LOOKING MAN WITH A BALD HEAD STANDING COLLAR AND OLD FASHIONED WATCH SEALS
SHOULD WE LEAVE THEM IGNORANT
WE ARE EXPECTING IT EVERY DAY
I'VE LOOKED OUT FOR THEM NANCY AND HIS FACE LIGHTED
HOW'S SHE LOADED TWO INCHES BY THE HEAD SIR T AIN'T ENOUGH THE CAPTAIN SHOUTED NOW
I DO LONG TO KNOW WHETHER I AM ONLY SIMPLY A LARGE-SIZED PIGMY AMONG THESE PIGMIES HERE WHO TUMBLE OVER SO EASILY WHEN ONE STRIKES THEM OR WHETHER I AM REALLY HER THOUGHTS DRIFTED INTO OTHER CHANNELS FOR A SEASON
POOR DEAR FRANCOIS--WHICH LEG DID HE BREAK MRS OREILLE MRS O.--"IT WAS HIS RIGHT HAND HIND LEG
AFTER THAT THEY BEGAN TO COME TO THEMSELVES BY DEGREES AND PRESENTLY THE SPELL WAS WHOLLY GONE AND THEY WERE RECITING VERSES AND PULLING HAIR
TRIUMPH NO
IF THE TIME EVER COMES AND I GET A CHANCE OH I'LL SHE COULD NOT FIND A WORD THAT WAS STRONG ENOUGH PERHAPS
PATRICK COUGHLIN
CHAPTER XXXII
COMMITTEE
ALL THE TIME HE HAD A WIFE IN NEW ORLEANS
THE HOTEL CLERK SAID THAT HE NOTICED THERE WAS MURDER IN THE WOMAN'S EYE WHEN HE SAW HER
THE COLONEL SEEING THE ATTENTION OF THE COUNSEL AND COURT ENTIRELY WITHDRAWN FROM HIM THOUGHT HE PERCEIVED HERE HIS OPPORTUNITY TURNING AND BEAMING UPON THE JURY HE BEGAN SIMPLY TO TALK BUT AS THE GRANDEUR OF HIS POSITION GREW UPON HIM--HIS TALK BROADENED UNCONSCIOUSLY INTO AN ORATORICAL VEIN
FIVE MINUTES AFTER TWO SHOTS WERE FIRED IN QUICK SUCCESSION AND THERE WAS A RUSH TO THE PARLOR FROM WHICH THE REPORTS CAME
GEORGE SELBY ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE COTTON CLAIMS
OR IF HE DOES HE PROBABLY FINDS THAT IT IS PRINCETON OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
IT SEEMED TO HIM A FEVERISH UNHEALTHY ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH LUNACY WOULD BE EASILY DEVELOPED
A COUNTRY GIRL POOR ENOUGH THAT WAS EVIDENT
I ONLY WISHED TO MAKE GOOD MY ASSERTION THAT I KNEW YOU
THE WORDS OF THE PROPRIETOR OF A RICH COAL MINE HAVE A GOLDEN SOUND AND HIS COMMON SAYINGS ARE REPEATED AS IF THEY WERE SOLID WISDOM
WITH LITTLE SPACE FOR THOUGHT SHE WAS RAPIDLY DRIVEN TO THE RAILWAY STATION AND CONVEYED TO THE HOSPITAL FOR LUNATIC CRIMINALS
THROUGH THE SCENES OF THIS PAINFUL HISTORY HE FLITS HERE AND THERE A LUNATIC
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA
THEY ALWAYS DO
TALK OF IT FILLED THE TOWN
POLLY--I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOSE THE RUN OF THE MAP--WELL TAKE YOUR TOY-HORSE JAMES FITZ-JAMES IF YOU MUST HAVE IT--AND RUN ALONG WITH YOU
WHAT CAN I DO
WHO'S YOUR DOCTOR MRS HIGGINS MRS H.--"WELL WE HAD DR SPOONER A GOOD WHILE BUT HE RUNS SO MUCH TO EMETICS WHICH I THINK ARE WEAKENING THAT WE CHANGED OFF AND TOOK DR LEATHERS
SAYS IT'S MUD OR SOME SICH KIND O NASTINESS THAT STICKS ON N COVERS UP EVERYTHING
HE WAS CONSTANTLY HAVING YOUNG LADIES THRUST UPON HIS NOTICE AT RECEPTIONS OR LEFT UPON HIS HANDS AT PARTIES AND IN TIME HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE WAS BEING DELIBERATELY PERSECUTED IN THIS WAY
WE'LL MAKE IT BOYS SAID THE CHIEF IF WE HAVE TO GO IN A BALLOON AND MAKE IT THEY DID
AFTER A TIME SHE TOOK UP A BOOK
YOU SURELY CANNOT HAVE HAD A LARGE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS SORT OF THING
THIS CALL WAS PAID BY MRS MAJOR-GENERAL FULKE-FULKERSON AND DAUGHTER
NEVER GIVE UP THE SHIP
I'VE GONE AND DONE IT NOW DONE WHAT SI FOR MERCY'S SAKE DONE EVERYTHING
THE SERVANT MAID KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND PASSED IN A TELEGRAM SAYING IT HAD COME WHILE THEY WERE GONE
BUT BY AND BY HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT PERHAPS HE UNDERRATED HIS POWERS
IT WAS A HOT AUGUST MORNING
A DAPPER CLERK OF PERHAPS NINETEEN OR TWENTY YEARS WITH HAIR ACCURATELY PARTED AND SURPRISINGLY SLICK CAME BUSTLING UP AND LEANED OVER WITH A PRETTY SMILE AND AN AFFABLE CAN I--WAS THERE ANY PARTICULAR BOOK YOU WISHED TO SEE HAVE YOU TAINE'S ENGLAND BEG PARDON TAINE'S NOTES ON ENGLAND THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN SCRATCHED THE SIDE OF HIS NOSE WITH A CEDAR PENCIL WHICH HE TOOK DOWN FROM ITS BRACKET ON THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AND REFLECTED A MOMENT
WELL ALL RIGHT--DON'T DESPAIR
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK
HIS MOTHER WHEN HE WENT HOME AFTER HIS RECOVERY FROM HIS ACCIDENT HAD AFFECTED TO BE VERY JEALOUS OF MRS BOLTON ABOUT WHOM AND RUTH SHE ASKED A THOUSAND QUESTIONS--AN AFFECTATION OF JEALOUSY WHICH NO DOUBT CONCEALED A REAL HEARTACHE WHICH COMES TO EVERY MOTHER WHEN HER SON GOES OUT INTO THE WORLD AND FORMS NEW TIES
HE WAS SHORTLY CONVINCED
NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY-ONE TWENTY-TWO TWEN----AH THAT'S ALL.--YES AS I WAS SAYING TO OLD JUDGE----GO IT OLD GIRL DON'T MIND ME.--NOW HOW IS THAT?----ISN'T THAT A GOOD SPIRITED TONE
MIDSUMMER ARRIVED
HE CAME THE DAY BUT ONE BEFORE HE WAS SHOT
I MUST BE A VISIONARY
NO PEN CAN DO IT JUSTICE
O LORD WE'S BEN MIGHTY WICKED AN WE KNOWS DAT WE ZERVE TO GO TO DE BAD PLACE BUT GOOD LORD DEAH LORD WE AIN'T READY YIT WE AIN'T READY--LET DESE PO CHILEN HAB ONE MO CHANCE JES ONE MO CHANCE
BUT HE THOUGHT AT THE SAME MOMENT HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE IS
MR BRIERLY WAS A VERY USEFUL AND CHEERING PERSON WHEREVER HE WENT
NOW AND THEN A WARRIOR OF THE OPPOSITION BROKE DOWN UNDER THE PRESSURE GAVE IT UP AND WENT HOME
WHEN YOU ARRIVED IT WAS SNOWING
HE CALLED FOR THE QUESTION
AND HE CLOSED HIS LETTER THUS
IT IS TIME FOR ME TO TAKE MY LEAVE MISS HAWKINS NO--WAIT A MOMENT
THIS APARTMENT WAS THE FAMILY BEDROOM PARLOR LIBRARY AND KITCHEN ALL IN ONE
YOU CAN'T TALK AGAINST HER--YOU HAVE TO JUST BE PATIENT AND HOLD UP TILL SHE'S SAID HER SAY
THE THREE CARRIAGES ARRIVED AT THE SAME MOMENT FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
I THINK THAT WOULD CURE HER OF SOME OF HER NOTIONS
THE RICHEST LAND ON GOD ALMIGHTY'S FOOTSTOOL IS LYING RIGHT OUT THERE
AVERAGE COST FIVE AND SEVEN CENTS FOR THE TWO SIZES
LACKLAND HAD COME UPON THE TRACK OF A MAN WHO WAS SEARCHING FOR A LOST CHILD IN A MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOAT EXPLOSION YEARS BEFORE
HE WAS A FALSEHOOD DONE IN FLESH AND BLOOD
THE LADIES WERE SOON SEATED IN FILES ALONG THE WALL AND IN GROUPS HERE AND THERE AND THE COLORED WAITERS FILLED THE PLATES AND GLASSES AND THE MALE GUESTS MOVED HITHER AND THITHER CONVEYING THEM TO THE PRIVILEGED SEX
TRYING TO MAKE OUR FORTUNE IN VIRGINIA BERIAH SELLERS NEARLY RUINED US AND WE HAD TO SETTLE IN KENTUCKY AND START OVER AGAIN
WE DON'T PRETEND TO STYLE
THEY'RE WORTH ALL THE TROUBLE THEY ARE NANCY YES AND MORE SI I BELIEVE YOU
I HOPED SAID PHILIP
ALL STRANGERS OF CONSEQUENCE WHO VISITED THE VILLAGE GRAVITATED TO THE HAWKINS MANSION AND BECAME GUESTS OF THE JUDGE HAWKINS HAD LEARNED TO LIKE THE PEOPLE OF HIS SECTION VERY MUCH
UPON SUCH OCCASIONS HE WOULD GO INTO THE NEAREST MINE ON THE VEIN HE WAS HUNTING FOR AND ONCE MORE GET THE BEARINGS OF THE DEPOSIT AND MARK OUT ITS PROBABLE COURSE
SHE NEVER WOULD LOVE HIM AND SHE WAS GOING TO THE DEVIL BESIDES
HE WENT OUT WITH A COMPANY FROM HAWKEYE TO THE WAR AND WAS NOT WANTING IN COURAGE BUT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER SOLDIER IF HE HAD BEEN LESS ENGAGED IN CONTRIVANCES FOR CIRCUMVENTING THE ENEMY BY STRATEGY UNKNOWN TO THE BOOKS
BUCKSTONE GIVES NOTICE OF THE THIEVING KNOBS UNIVERSITY JOB
HOW IS IT THAT THE REPORTS MADE NO IMPRESSION ON YOU NEVER BELIEVE ANYTHING I SEE IN THE NEWSPAPERS LAUGHTER FROM THE CROWD APPROVING SMILES FROM HIS HONOR AND MR BRAHAM JUROR SWORN IN
PHILIP WHO HAD SO LONG KNOWN HARRY NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND THAT HARRY DID NOT HIMSELF BELIEVE THAT HE WAS A CHIEF ACTOR IN ALL THESE LARGE OPERATIONS OF WHICH HE TALKED SO MUCH
SIX OF THEM HAVEN'T GOT QUITE BACK-BONE ENOUGH TO SLEW AROUND AND COME RIGHT OUT FOR YOU ON THE FIRST BALLOT TO-MORROW
THE CAREFUL FATHER ALSO TOLD HER TO WRITE WASHINGTON AND WARN HIM NOT TO SPECULATE WITH THE MONEY BUT TO WAIT A LITTLE AND ADVISE WITH ONE OR TWO WISE OLD HEADS
I WONDERED WHY HE CALLED
THE PARVENUS LAUGHED AT THE ANTIQUES AND SECRETLY ENVIED THEM THERE WERE CERTAIN IMPORTANT SOCIETY CUSTOMS WHICH ONE IN LAURA'S POSITION NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND
YOUR HAND AGAIN MY BOY
HERE LET ME GIVE YOU SOME MORE OF THE TURNIPS
THE MOMENT THE HOUSE HAD RESUMED ITS FUNCTIONS AND RECEIVED THE REPORT MR BUCKSTONE MOVED AND CARRIED THE THIRD READING OF THE BILL
YOU CAN CONVINCE A MAN OF ANYTHING WHEN YOU TRY
HE WAS UNABLE TO PROCURE THE GREEK FIRE BUT HE CONSTRUCTED A VICIOUS TORPEDO WHICH WOULD HAVE ANSWERED THE PURPOSE BUT THE FIRST ONE PREMATURELY EXPLODED IN HIS WOOD-HOUSE BLOWING IT CLEAN AWAY AND SETTING FIRE TO HIS HOUSE
YOU SEEM TO GO THE FURTHEST AROUND TO GET AT A THING--BUT YOU ARE IN EARNEST AREN'T YOU YES I AM INDEED VERY WELL I WILL DO IT--BUT WHY NOT TELL ME HOW YOU IMAGINE IT IS GOING TO HELP YOU I WILL BY AND BY.--NOW THERE IS NOBODY TALKING TO HIM
SELLERS--GO INTO THE LAW SIR
YOU MIGHT AS WELL MURDER SOMEBODY AND HAVE THE CREDIT OF IT AS GET INTO THE NEWSPAPERS THE WAY I HAVE
BUT HE HIMSELF DECLARES THAT HE HAS GONE OVER BECAUSE THE MALIGNANT PERSECUTION OF THE BILL BY THE NEWSPAPERS CAUSED HIM TO STUDY ITS PROVISIONS WITH MORE CARE THAN HE HAD PREVIOUSLY DONE AND THIS CLOSE EXAMINATION REVEALED THE FACT THAT THE MEASURE IS ONE IN EVERY WAY WORTHY OF SUPPORT
IT WAS DEEMED BETTER STRATEGY TO TIRE OUT THE OPPOSITION
OH NO
WHEN THE VISITORS SWEPT INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM THEY FILLED THE PLACE WITH A SUFFOCATING SWEETNESS PROCURED AT THE PERFUMER'S
CONSEQUENTLY EVERYTHING IN THE NATURE OF MODERN FASHION AND GRANDEUR WAS A NEW AND WONDERFUL REVELATION TO HIM
THE COLONEL ENJOYED THIS BUSTLE AND CONFUSION AMAZINGLY
TIM STAID WITH HIM TILL THE LAST MOMENT AND THEN TOOK UP HIS JOB AT THE GOLDEN BRIER APPARENTLY AS DEPRESSED BY THE CONTINUED BARRENNESS OF THEIR MUTUAL LABORS AS PHILIP WAS HIMSELF
IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO PHILIP THAT THERE WAS ANY THING EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT THE FAMILY THAT NEEDED MENTION
THE POSITION OF ALDERMAN WAS FORCED UPON HIM AND IT WAS JUST THE SAME AS PRESENTING HIM A GOLD MINE
IT WAS ONE OF RUTH'S DELIGHTS TO CRAM HERSELF WITH SOME OUT OF THE WAY SUBJECT AND ENDEAVOR TO CATCH HER FATHER
OFFICIAL POSITION NO MATTER HOW OBTAINED ENTITLED A MAN TO A PLACE IN IT AND CARRIED HIS FAMILY WITH HIM NO MATTER WHENCE THEY SPRANG
RHEUMATISM
BUT HE COULD NOT SLEEP
HE APPEARED FLUSTERED LIKE
STARTLING NEWS FROM SAINT'S REST
I DON'T KNOW HOW I EVER DARED TO SEND YOU A NOTE MR BUCKSTONE FOR YOU HAVE THE REPUTATION OF NOT BEING VERY PARTIAL TO OUR SEX WHY I AM SURE MY REPUTATION DOES ME WRONG THEN MISS HAWKINS
WITH THE CALL-BOY
BUT SERIOUSLY YOU DO NOT FORGET THAT SOME OF THE BEST AND PUREST MEN IN CONGRESS TOOK THAT STOCK IN THAT WAY DID SENATOR BLANK WELL NO--I BELIEVE NOT OF COURSE YOU BELIEVE NOT
QUITE A SETTLEMENT OF BOARD AND LOG SHANTIES HAD GONE UP WITH A BLACKSMITH SHOP A SMALL MACHINE SHOP AND A TEMPORARY STORE FOR SUPPLYING THE WANTS OF THE WORKMEN
HE HAS A FINE EUROPEAN REPUTATION TOO
NOW WE WANT TO PUT IN ONE PARTING BLAST FOR LUCK
BUT THE RESULT WAS THE SAME EVERY TIME
SOMETIMES THEY TORE THEMSELVES FREE AND SAID THEIR SERFDOM WAS ENDED
DON'T GRIEVE NANCY DON'T GRIEVE
THE PASSION POSSESSED HER WHOLE BEING AND LIFTED HER UP TILL SHE SEEMED TO WALK ON AIR
NEVER PAID THEM A CENT
RUTH SAID HER MOTHER BENDING OVER HER PHILIP IS HERE RUTH'S EYES UNCLOSED THERE WAS A GLEAM OF RECOGNITION IN THEM THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT AT A SMILE UPON HER FACE AND SHE TRIED TO RAISE HER THIN HAND AS PHILIP TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD WITH HIS LIPS
THEN CAME STORIES ABOUT LAURA TOWN TALK GOSSIP WHICH HARRY DENIED THE TRUTH OF INDIGNANTLY
A FEW DAYS LATER WHEN HE STOOD UNCOVERED WHILE THE LAST PRAYER WAS PRONOUNCED OVER LAURA'S GRAVE HIS HAIR WAS WHITER AND HIS FACE HARDLY LESS OLD THAN THE VENERABLE MINISTER'S WHOSE WORDS WERE SOUNDING IN HIS EARS
CONDUCTOR SLUM WHO IS TOO OLD A BIRD TO BE CAUGHT WITH CHAFF COURTEOUSLY INFORMED HER THAT THE CAR WAS FULL AND WHEN SHE INSISTED ON REMAINING HE PERSUADED HER TO GO INTO THE CAR WHERE SHE BELONGED
HE BROUGHT SADLY NEEDED HELP WITH HIM CONSISTING OF THE SAVINGS OF A YEAR AND A HALF OF WORK--NEARLY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN MONEY
I'VE GOT SOME PRODIGIOUS OPERATIONS ON FOOT
DOES YOUR DOCTOR KNOW ANY THING--I DON'T MEAN ABOUT MEDICINE BUT ABOUT THINGS IN GENERAL IS HE A MAN OF INFORMATION AND GOOD SENSE ONCE ASKED AN OLD PRACTITIONER
FINALLY THEY RETURNED HOME AND BECAME ULTRA FASHIONABLES
WHAT-ASLEEP
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A COL
LORD IT'S MAGNIFICENT NEWS--PERFECTLY MAGNIFICENT
AND AFTER BREAKFAST THEY TWO WENT ALONE TO THE GRAVE AND HIS HEART WENT OUT TO HIS NEW FRIEND AND HIS UNTAUGHT ELOQUENCE POURED THE PRAISES OF HIS BURIED IDOL INTO HER EARS WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE
WHAT DID HE DO FIRST
THERE ARE WOMEN IT IS TRUE WHO SEEM TO BE CAPABLE NEITHER OF RISING MUCH NOR OF FALLING MUCH AND WHOM A CONVENTIONAL LIFE SAVES FROM ANY SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT OF CHARACTER
CERTAINLY HE SAID HE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS A GOOD THING
IF EVER ANY MAN BEGUILED HIM WITH TURNIPS AND WATER AGAIN LET HIM DIE THE DEATH
MR BUCKSTONE ROSE IN HIS PLACE AND GAVE NOTICE OF A BILL TO FOUND AND INCORPORATE THE KNOBS INDUSTRIAL UNIVERSITY AND THEN SAT DOWN WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING FURTHER
HE WANTS PHILIP TO SURVEY IT AND EXAMINE IT FOR INDICATIONS OF COAL IT'S ANOTHER OF FATHER'S FORTUNES I SUPPOSE SAID RUTH
AT THE END OF THREE MONTHS THE CITY WOULD OWE THE COMPANY THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS-TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THAT WOULD BE PROFITS
THEY HAD GUTTED THE NAVIGATION OFFICE THEN PILED THE BEAUTIFUL ENGRAVED STOCK-BOOKS AND THINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR AND ENJOYED THE BONFIRE WHILE IT LASTED
IT WAS WELL THAT MRS HAWKINS HELD THE PURSE OTHERWISE THE TREASURE WOULD HAVE LASTED BUT A VERY LITTLE WHILE
BUT AS SOON AS THE LAND IS SOLD EMILY WERE YOU ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING SAID HAWKINS
AND SO HER RESOLUTION WAS TAKEN
SHE WILL TRY TO BLUSH AND IT WILL BE ONLY POLITE IN YOU TO TAKE THE EFFORT FOR THE DEED
HE SAID THAT ALL MEN WERE BRETHREN AND ALL WERE ENTITLED TO THE HONEST UNSELFISH HELP AND COUNTENANCE OF A CHRISTIAN LABORER IN THE PUBLIC VINEYARD
SELBY ATE ANY BREAKFAST AND WHAT HE ATE AND IF HE HAD ANY APPETITE
THEY THRONGED AFTER THE CARRIAGE HOOTING JEERING CURSING AND EVEN ASSAILING THE VEHICLE WITH MISSILES
BUT COURAGE
IT INCORPORATED THE KNOBS INDUSTRIAL UNIVERSITY LOCATING IT IN EAST TENNESSEE DECLARING IT OPEN TO ALL PERSONS WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF SEX COLOR OR RELIGION AND COMMITTING ITS MANAGEMENT TO A BOARD OF PERPETUAL TRUSTEES WITH POWER TO FILL VACANCIES IN THEIR OWN NUMBER
THE THING IS DEAD SURE
PHILIP EXAMINED HIS UGLY VISAGE AND STRONG CROOKED FORE-ARM AS HE WAS WAITING ADMITTANCE HAVING POUNDED UPON THE DOOR
WHEN RUTH RETURNED TO PHILADELPHIA IT MUST BE CONFESSED--THOUGH IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN BY HER--THAT A MEDICAL CAREER DID SEEM A LITTLE LESS NECESSARY FOR HER THAN FORMERLY
HE COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED THAT THE YOUNG GIRL WAS READING A VOLUME OF REPORTS OF CLINICS AND LONGING TO BE ELSEWHERE
HIS FACE ANSWERED FOR THAT
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THESE EMPLOYEES AND THEY HAVE GATHERED THERE FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE UNION AND GOT THEIR BERTHS THROUGH THE INTERCESSION COMMAND IS NEARER THE WORD OF THE SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES

AND THEN YOU KNOW THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF COMMON INTERESTS
OR DIVERTING MRS MONTAGUE WITH HIS EXPERIENCE IN COOKING IN CAMP
BUT DEY DIDN'T KNOW NUFFIN BOUT IT--HEAL RIGHT UP AGIN
AND IT'S TALKED ABOUT I CAN TELL YOU JEALOUSY HAD NO DOUBT SHARPENED THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN'S OBSERVATION
THERE'S TWO MONTHS WAGES DUE THE MEN AND HOW
SELLERS THREW A LOT OR TWO ON THE MARKET AS A FEELER AND THEY SOLD WELL
AH THAT IS RIGHT--SIT DOWN AGAIN
MR BUCKSTONE EITHER PROMISE TO WRITE YOUR GREAT SPEECH FOR YOU OR ELSE GET SOME OTHER COMPETENT PERSON TO DO IT THIS IS PERFECTLY ABSURD MADAM PERFECTLY ABSURD AND MR TROLLOP AFFECTED A LAUGH OF DERISION
IS IT NOTHING TO SHOW A DISPOSITION TO SIFT THINGS AND BRING PEOPLE TO A STRICT ACCOUNT
BUT THEN HE LOVED HER
WE PREFER TO HAVE SO TREMENDOUS A POWER AS THAT IN OUR OWN HANDS
IT IS ALTOGETHER A BAD BUSINESS
I WILL DO IT TO-DAY
BUT WHEN I GET A LITTLE LOW AND FEEL BAD I GET A BIT TROUBLED AND WORRISOME BUT IT DON'T MEAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
BUT A TIME CAME AT LAST WHEN THE MATTER WOULD BEAR DELAY NO LONGER
ESPECIALLY AS LOUISE HAD ABSENTED HERSELF FROM BREAKFAST THAT MORNING AND TORN HIS HEART
A SERVANT ENTERED WITH THE AFTERNOON MAIL FROM THE OFFICE
TRIED TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH A PASSENGER-BEAR FASTENED TO THE VERGE-STAFF BUT WERE NOT ENCOURAGED
THIS GOOD AND CHRISTIAN COUNSEL IS GIVEN BY MARTINUS ZEILERUS IN HIS APODEMICAL CANONS BEFORE HIS ITINERARY OF SPAIN AND PORTUGAL EARLY IN THE MORNING SQUIRE HAWKINS TOOK PASSAGE IN A SMALL STEAMBOAT WITH HIS FAMILY AND HIS TWO SLAVES AND PRESENTLY THE BELL RANG THE STAGE-PLANK WAS HAULED IN AND THE VESSEL PROCEEDED UP THE RIVER
HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BUT ONE OUTWARD THING TO WIT THE GENERAL AND HE WAS REALLY NOT VIVIDLY CONSCIOUS OF HIM
MR HAWKINS SAID
NOW COLONEL CAN YOU PICTURE JEFFERSON OR WASHINGTON OR JOHN ADAMS FRANKING THEIR WARDROBES THROUGH THE MAILS AND ADDING THE FACETIOUS IDEA OF MAKING THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARGO FOR THE SUM OF ONE DOLLAR AND FIVE CENTS
PRESIDENT OF THE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY NO TIME TO GO FOR OUR OWN DOCTOR OF COURSE--AND THE MINUTE HE SAW FRANCOIS HE SAID SEND FOR YOUR OWN PHYSICIAN MADAM SAID IT AS CROSS AS A BEAR TOO AND TURNED RIGHT ON HIS HEEL AND CLEARED OUT WITHOUT DOING A THING EVERYBODY--"THE MEAN CONTEMPTIBLE BRUTE MRS O--"WELL YOU MAY SAY IT
SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT
THE WORLD IS DONE WITH ME AND PERHAPS I OUGHT TO BE DONE WITH IT
THE COUNTRY-BRED GIRL HAD NOT SUSPECTED THAT THE LITTLE WHINING TEN-OUNCE BLACK AND TAN REPTILE CLAD IN A RED EMBROIDERED PIGMY BLANKET AND REPOSING IN MRS OREILLE'S LAP ALL THROUGH THE VISIT WAS THE INDIVIDUAL WHOSE SUFFERINGS HAD BEEN STIRRING THE DORMANT GENEROSITIES OF HER NATURE
YOU WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ME WHEN I BEGGED YOU TO REDUCE YOUR STEAM
INSTANTLY THE AUDIENCE WAS ON ITS FEET AND A RUSH BEGAN FOR THE DOOR
BUT HE AIN'T TRIFLED WITH NOT MUCH
AND THEN THERE WAS A REVELATION--THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE STOVE BUT A LIGHTED TALLOW-CANDLE
THAT IS TO SAY WE ARE NO BETTER OFF THAN WHEN WE BEGAN
YOU ARE KNOWN HERE SIR SAID THE COLONEL AND HAWKEYE IS PROUD OF YOU
HE MADE ENDLESS CALCULATIONS WHICH NOBODY COULD UNDERSTAND OF THE PROBABLE POSITION OF THE VEIN
BUT I HOPE TO MAKE THE MATTER ENTERTAINING TO YOU TOO
STRANGERS MERELY SUPPOSED THAT THE SPEAKER WAS TAKING A GARGLE FOR SOME AFFECTION OF THE THROAT
BUT SHE WOULD DO IT
HE WAS FOR A LEASE HE DIDN'T WANT TO SURRENDER ANYTHING
IT IS ALL GOING TO COME OUT RIGHT
HE FOUND A STATELY DIGNITARY OCCUPYING A VERY OFFICIAL CHAIR BEHIND A LONG GREEN MOROCCO-COVERED TABLE IN A ROOM SUMPTUOUSLY CARPETED AND FURNISHED AND WELL GARNISHED WITH PICTURES
WHEN THE ABUSED BROWN GRASS NEWLY RELIEVED OF SNOW SEEMS CONSIDERING WHETHER IT CAN BE WORTH THE TROUBLE AND WORRY OF CONTRIVING ITS GREEN RAIMENT AGAIN ONLY TO FIGHT THE INEVITABLE FIGHT WITH THE IMPLACABLE WINTER AND BE VANQUISHED AND BURIED ONCE MORE
MR BRIERLY HUMOROUSLY SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE AS NONE OF THE MEMBERS WERE OCCUPIED IN NIGHT SESSION
SHE WOULD MARK HER COURSE UPON THE CHART OF LIFE AND FOLLOW IT
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THEY WOULD
HARRY SHOULDERED HIS ROD AND WENT TO THE FIELD TRAMPED OVER THE PRAIRIE BY DAY AND FIGURED UP RESULTS AT NIGHT WITH THE UTMOST CHEERFULNESS AND INDUSTRY AND PLOTTED THE LINE ON THE PROFILE PAPER WITHOUT HOWEVER THE LEAST IDEA OF ENGINEERING PRACTICAL OR THEORETICAL
BUT YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS POLLY DEAR--WOMEN HAVEN'T MUCH HEAD FOR BUSINESS YOU KNOW
HIS EYES MET HIS WIFE'S
A LOT OF DINNERS TO MEMBERS--SAY $10,000 ALTOGETHER
THE PARTY WENT TO THE SOUTHERN HOTEL WHERE THE GREAT DUFF BROWN WAS VERY WELL KNOWN AND INDEED WAS A MAN OF SO MUCH IMPORTANCE THAT EVEN THE OFFICE CLERK WAS RESPECTFUL TO HIM
WAS NOT HER LOVE FOR GEORGE SELBY DEEPER THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN'S COULD BE
WHEN SHE TOLD PHILIP OF IT THAT DISCREET YOUNG FELLOW ONLY SMILED AND SAID THAT HE HOPED SHE WOULD BE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE IN NEW YORK SOME EVENING WHEN HARRY HAD NOT ALREADY GIVEN THE USE OF HIS PRIVATE BOX TO SOME OTHER FRIEND
BUT IT IS USELESS FOR YOU TO SAY ANYTHING MORE PHILIP WENT AWAY WITH HIS HEART LIGHTENED ABOUT HARRY BUT PROFOUNDLY SADDENED BY THE GLIMPSE OF WHAT THIS WOMAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN
BUT THIS IS HISTORY AND NOT FICTION
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS--BUT ONLY TO YOU MR BRIERLY ONLY TO YOU MIND
SHE WAS BROKEN WITH THE DISGRACE AND THE LONG ANXIETY
THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS MOMENTARY INSANITY IN WHICH THE PERSON OTHERWISE RATIONAL TO ALL APPEARANCES WAS FOR THE TIME ACTUALLY BEREFT OF REASON AND NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ACTS
ALSO COMETS
THE PRESIDENT'S TABLE IS WELL ENOUGH HE USED TO SAY TO THE LOAFERS WHO GATHERED ABOUT HIM AT WILLARD'S WELL ENOUGH FOR A MAN ON A SALARY BUT GOD BLESS MY SOUL I SHOULD LIKE HIM TO SEE A LITTLE OLD-FASHIONED HOSPITALITY--OPEN HOUSE YOU KNOW

THE GROUNDS THAT HE HAD LAID OUT WITH SO MUCH DELIGHT IN FOLLOWING THE TASTES OF HIS WIFE WITH WHOM THE COUNTRY THE CULTIVATION OF RARE TREES AND FLOWERS THE CARE OF GARDEN AND LAWN AND CONSERVATORIES WERE A PASSION ALMOST
NOW HERE--I DON'T ALTOGETHER LIKE THIS
THE LONG-LEGGED YOUTH WHO CARRIED THE MAIL TARRIED AN HOUR TO TALK FOR THERE WAS NO HURRY
IT IS NOTHING
AND EXCHANGED GOSSIP WITH THEM TO THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE
POSSIBLY IT IS
ALL WERE AFFECTED--EVEN LAURA--BUT HERS WAS AN AFFECTION OF THE STOMACH
WHEN THE SUN SHINES OUT AND A FEW BIRDS VENTURE FORTH AND LIFT UP A FORGOTTEN SONG
NOTHING CAN SAVE THE POOR GIRL NOW
I TOLD HER PERCY COULDN'T ABIDE WINDS AS HE WAS THREATENED WITH A PULMONARY AFFECTION AND THEN SHE SAID TRY ST AUGUSTINE
PROVIDENCE HE SAID HAS PLACED THEM IN OUR HANDS AND ALTHOUGH YOU AND I GENERAL MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN A DIFFERENT DESTINY FOR THEM UNDER THE CONSTITUTION YET PROVIDENCE KNOWS BEST YOU CAN'T DO MUCH WITH EM INTERRUPTED COL
WELL THE OTHER DAY HE LET ME INTO A LITTLE SECRET STRICTLY ON THE QUIET ABOUT THIS MATTER OF THE PLAGUE
HOLD
I THINK WILL VOTE FOR IT I HOPE SO

BUT THERE WAS NO REAL DANGER TO A PERSON WHO TOOK CARE OF HIMSELF
OF COURSE THAT'S ALL GENERAL LAUGHTER MISS G
SO I HAVE DROPPED THAT FOR THE PRESENT THOUGH I CAN TAKE IT UP AGAIN SOME DAY WHEN I LEARN HOW TO MANAGE THE MIXTURE BETTER WELL WHAT HAVE YOU GOT ON HAND--ANYTHING YES SIR THREE OR FOUR THINGS
THEY HAD A LIKING FOR THE COLONEL BUT STILL THEY HAD SOME IDEA OF HANGING HIM AS A SORT OF MAKE-SHIFT THAT MIGHT ANSWER AFTER A FASHION IN PLACE OF MORE SATISFACTORY GAME
DON'T USE SUCH STRONG LANGUAGE
CHAPTER XXXIV
HER PRIDE WAS HUMBLED HER SPIRIT WAS BROKEN
EVERYBODY WORKS FOR ME,"--SO RAN HER THOUGHT
I WOULD STICK TO THESE
PRESENTLY HE ROSE UP AND CAST A LOOK FAR AWAY TOWARD THE VALLEY AND HIS THOUGHTS TOOK A NEW DIRECTION
BUT DILWORTHY SENATOR DILWORTHY SAYS TO ME COLONEL YOU ARE THE MAN YOU COULD INFLUENCE MORE VOTES THAN ANY ONE ELSE ON SUCH A MEASURE AN OLD SETTLER A MAN OF THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW THE WANTS OF MISSOURI

I HAVE A SMALL IDEA THAT MAY DEVELOP INTO SOMETHING FOR US BOTH ALL IN GOOD TIME
WHEN THE TIME FOR HIS DEPARTURE CAME IT WAS EASY TO SEE HOW FONDLY ALL LOVED HIM AND HOW HARD IT WAS TO LET HIM GO NOTWITHSTANDING THEY HAD OFTEN SEEN HIM GO BEFORE IN HIS ST LOUIS SCHOOLING DAYS
HE TAUGHT THE DUTCHMAN HOW TO MIX A GREAT MANY COOLING DRINKS FOR THE SUMMER TIME AND HAD A BILL AT THE HOTEL THE GROWING LENGTH OF WHICH MR DUSENHEIMER CONTEMPLATED WITH PLEASANT ANTICIPATIONS
I THINK THERE IS MORE REAL TALENT AMONG OUR PUBLIC MEN OF TO-DAY THAN THERE WAS AMONG THOSE OF OLD TIMES--A FAR MORE FERTILE FANCY A MUCH HAPPIER INGENUITY

HOLD ON A BIT
IF A VOTE OF BOTH SPECTATORS AND JURY COULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN THEN THE VERDICT WOULD HAVE BEEN LET HER GO SHE HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH BUT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAD THE CLOSING ARGUMENT
WOULD IT BE LONG
THEY TROUBLED THEMSELVES BUT LITTLE ABOUT THE TWO OTHER ORDERS OF NOBILITY BUT MOVED SERENELY IN THEIR WIDE ORBIT CONFIDENT IN THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND WELL AWARE OF THE POTENCY OF THEIR INFLUENCE
I KNOW IT AND THE PROSPECT WAS SO CHEERFUL THAT HE WEPT
NOT MUCH
I THOUGHT LADIES MEMORIES WERE MORE FICKLE THAN THAT OH THEY ARE NOT SO FICKLE AS GENTLEMEN'S PROMISES
PERHAPS HE AS AN UNINTERESTED PERSON IN WHOM SHE WOULD HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE AND AS ONE OF THE PUBLIC COULD SAY SOME THING TO HER THAT WOULD SHOW HER WHERE SHE STOOD
IT WAS A LEGISLATURE OF THE MODERN PATTERN
THERE WAS BUT ONE THING LEFT THAT COULD GIVE A PASSING ZEST TO A WASTED LIFE AND THAT WAS FAME ADMIRATION THE APPLAUSE OF THE MULTITUDE
THE UNIVERSITY BILL WAS SAFE NOW
LAIS WANDERING AWAY WITH THE YOUTH RIPPOSTRATUS IS SLAIN BY THE WOMEN WHO ARE JEALOUS OF HER CHARMS
A MAN MIGHT AS WELL BE AT SOME THING AND BESIDES I CONSIDER THAT I OWE YOU WHAT YOU PAID ME WHEN I WAS LAID UP PHILIP SAID OH NO HE DIDN'T OWE ANYTHING
HARDLY A SOUND DISTURBED THE STILLNESS SAVE THE MONOTONOUS ELOQUENCE OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO OCCUPIED THE FLOOR
AT WHICH THE SQUIRE LAUGHED AND SAID HE QUITE AGREED WITH HIM
ALL DEBATE CAME TO A SUDDEN END OF COURSE
WHEN WASHINGTON HAD PRESENTLY GOT HIS THOUGHTS INTO LINE AGAIN HE SAID TO HIMSELF WHY HONESTLY I ONLY MEANT TO COMPLIMENT HIM--INDEED I WOULD NOT HAVE HURT HIM FOR THE WORLD CHAPTER LII

YES THAT'S VERY GOOD INDEED--STUFF
BUT SHE ALMOST ALWAYS FAILED
CONDUCTOR SLUM IS ONE OF THE MOST GENTLEMANLY AND EFFICIENT OFFICERS ON THE ROAD
I HAVE BEEN WITH HIM A GREAT DEAL ON CONFERENCE COMMITTEES
IT WAS IN THIS TIME OF RATHER IMPATIENT WAITING THAT PHILIP WAS ONE MORNING WALKING DOWN BROADWAY WITH HENRY BRIERLY
I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS GENTLEMEN I SHALL GO IN FOR REFORM
THE STOCK OF EVERY ONE OF THOSE WILDCATS WOULD SPIN UP TO A TREMENDOUS PREMIUM BEFORE YOU COULD TURN A HANDSPRING--PROFIT ON THE SPECULATION NOT A DOLLAR LESS THAN FORTY MILLIONS AN ELOQUENT PAUSE WHILE THE MARVELOUS VISION SETTLED INTO W.'S FOCUS WHERE'S YOUR HOGS NOW
THEE KNOWS I COULDN'T STAND IT AT WESTFIELD
I'LL MAKE IT BREED
SHE IS IN WASHINGTON APPARENTLY THE HAPPY FAVORITE OF A BRILLIANT SOCIETY
I MEAN TO HAVE THE NOBLEST HOUSE THAT MONEY CAN BUILD THEN AFTER A PAUSE--HE DID NOT NOTICE LAURA'S SMILES LAURA WOULD YOU LAY THE MAIN HALL IN ENCAUSTIC TILES OR JUST IN FANCY PATTERNS OF HARD WOOD LAURA LAUGHED A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED LAUGH THAT HAD MORE OF HER FORMER NATURAL SELF ABOUT IT THAN ANY SOUND THAT HAD ISSUED FROM HER MOUTH IN MANY WEEKS
PATRIQUE OREILLE WAS A WEALTHY FRENCHMAN FROM CORK
A LITTLE IDEA OF MY OWN WASHINGTON--ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS IN THE WORLD
AND I THINK SIR THE JUDGE
I MEAN TO PUT THINGS IN YOUR WAY THAN WILL MAKE A MERE LIVELIHOOD A TRIFLING THING
DOCS ON THEM AND FRANK THEM HOME
SHE WOULD NOW LOOK THE FUTURE IN THE FACE
AND BEFORE YOU HAVE BEEN IN WASHINGTON MANY WEEKS YOU WILL BE MEAN ENOUGH TO BELIEVE HER TOO
I CAN MANAGE IT I AM SURE
DIS CHILE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAH WE'D A BEN NOW IF IT WARN'T FO DAT PRAH
THERE WERE SKETCHES BIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL
LAURA HAD DECLINED TO SEE EITHER PHILIP OR HARRY SOMEWHAT TO THE FORMER'S RELIEF WHO HAD A NOTION THAT SHE WOULD NECESSARILY FEEL HUMILIATED BY SEEING HIM AFTER BREAKING FAITH WITH HIM BUT TO THE DISCOMFITURE OF HARRY WHO STILL FELT HER FASCINATION AND THOUGHT HER REFUSAL HEARTLESS
SHE HAD THAT RESOLUTION IN HER THAT COULD CONQUER DEATH ALMOST
HE CAME
THE FORMER GENTLEMAN WAS DESPONDENT THE LATTER HOPEFUL
A GREAT MORAL INFLUENCE WAS THUS BROUGHT TO BEAR IN FAVOR OF THE BILL
WHILE HARRY WAS IN WASHINGTON DANCING ATTENDANCE UPON THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE AND MAKING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE VAST LOBBY THAT ENCIRCLED IT PHILIP DEVOTED HIMSELF DAY AND NIGHT WITH AN ENERGY AND A CONCENTRATION HE WAS CAPABLE OF TO THE LEARNING AND THEORY OF HIS PROFESSION AND TO THE SCIENCE OF RAILROAD BUILDING
IT NEEDED HIS PRESENCE AND HIS WATCHING NO LONGER
THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WASHINGTON--NOW A LANK DREAMY-EYED STRIPLING BETWEEN TWENTY-TWO AND TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE--SAID
HAWKINS UNCOVERED AND APPROACHED
WELL TO OTHERS
AND EXAMPLES WERE NOT WANTING TO ENCOURAGE HIM
NED THEY SAY YOU DON'T GO THERE ANY MORE
PHILIP HAD A GOOD APPETITE A SUNNY TEMPER AND A CLEAR HEARTY LAUGH
A STRONG YEARNING CAME UPON HER TO LAY HER HEAD UPON A LOYAL BREAST AND FIND REST FROM THE CONFLICT OF LIFE SOLACE FOR HER GRIEFS THE HEALING OF LOVE FOR HER BRUISED HEART
AND THEN THERE'S SO MANY POOR IN THE LEGISLATURE TO BE LOOKED AFTER SAID THE CONTRACTOR WITH A SORT OF A CHUCKLE ISN'T THAT SO MR BOLTON ELI BOLTON REPLIED THAT HE NEVER HAD MUCH TO DO WITH THE LEGISLATURE
SO HE GOT UP AND WROTE A LONG RAPTUROUS LETTER TO LOUISE AND ANOTHER TO HIS MOTHER
THERE WAS A TWO-THIRDS VOTE ON THE UNIVERSITY SIDE--AND TWO OVER
SEVENTHLY BEFORE HIS VOYAGE HE SHOULD MAKE HIS PEACE WITH GOD SATISFIE HIS CREDITORS IF HE BE IN DEBT
IT WAS OUR LAST CHANCE AND IT IS GONE
BELOW A FEW SENATORS LOUNGED UPON THE SOFAS SET APART FOR VISITORS AND TALKED WITH IDLE CONGRESSMEN
BUT YOUR SECULAR PAPER STICKS YOU RIGHT INTO THE ADVERTISING COLUMNS AND OF COURSE YOU DON'T TAKE A TRICK
HE WAS A CORK THAT COULD NOT BE KEPT UNDER THE WATER MANY MOMENTS AT A TIME
AND IF YOU COULD ONLY PERSUADE HIM OUT OF HIS HOSTILITY TO THE BILL TOO--BUT DON'T OVERDO THE THING
THE SQUIRE WAS CONTEMPLATING THE MORNING
MR BOLTON LIKED COMPANY A HOUSE FULL OF IT AND THE MIRTH OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND HE WOULD HAVE WILLINGLY ENTERED INTO ANY REVOLUTIONARY PLANS RUTH MIGHT HAVE SUGGESTED IN RELATION TO FRIENDS SOCIETY
SAID LIKE A TRUE MAN SAID ONE
THAT IS TO SAY ONE MAY SUGGEST A THING TO MR TROLLOP WHICH IT WOULD NOT DO TO SUGGEST TO MR BLANK
SMILING AND RUBBING HIS HANDS
HE SUCCEEDED AND WAS RADIANT UNDER THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF HER PLEASED FACE AND HER SEDUCTIVELY WORDED ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS WITH GRATIFICATION
HOW DO YOU LIKE WASHINGTON LAURA LIKED IT VERY WELL INDEED
THE REPORT THAT THE JURY HAVE BROUGHT HER IN GUILTY IS FALSE AND PREMATURE PREMATURE GASPED WASHINGTON TURNING WHITE
HE SAID THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE QUEENLIEST CREATURE IN THE LAND BUT THAT SHE WAS ONLY COMMONPLACE BEFORE COMPARED TO WHAT SHE WAS NOW SO EXTRAORDINARY WAS THE IMPROVEMENT WROUGHT BY RICH FASHIONABLE ATTIRE
I THOUGHT ONCE AS THEE DOES NOW AND HAD AS LITTLE THOUGHT OF BEING A FRIEND AS THEE HAS
HE HAD KNOWN HER SO LONG SHE HAD SOMEHOW GROWN INTO HIS LIFE BY HABIT THAT HE WOULD EXPECT THE PLEASURE OF HER SOCIETY WITHOUT THINKING MUCH ABOUT IT
HARRY SANG FRAGMENTS OF OPERAS AND TALKED ABOUT THEIR FORTUNE
MRS HAWKINS SLOWLY AND CONSCIENTIOUSLY AS IF EVERY DETAIL OF HER FAMILY HISTORY WAS IMPORTANT TOLD THE STORY OF THE STEAMBOAT EXPLOSION OF THE FINDING AND ADOPTION OF LAURA
THE COLONEL TRIED AS WELL AS HE COULD UNDER THE DREARY CIRCUMSTANCES TO HEARTEN HIM A LITTLE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
CLAY HAWKINS YEARS GONE BY HAD YIELDED AFTER MANY A STRUGGLE TO THE MIGRATORY AND SPECULATIVE INSTINCT OF OUR AGE AND OUR PEOPLE AND HAD WANDERED FURTHER AND FURTHER WESTWARD UPON TRADING VENTURES
HER COURSE OF ACTION WAS QUITE DETERMINED
WHATEVER HER THOUGHTS MAY HAVE BEEN THEY WERE UNKNOWN TO PHILIP AS THEY ARE TO THESE HISTORIANS
HE COULD NOT WAIT FOR THE PAPERS THEMSELVES TO CRAWL ALONG DOWN TO WASHINGTON BY A MAIL TRAIN WHICH HAS NEVER RUN OVER A COW SINCE THE ROAD WAS BUILT
INDEED THE TALENTS OF A RICH AND ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG FELLOW LIKE HARRY WERE NOT LIKELY TO GO UNAPPRECIATED IN SUCH A PLACE

DILWORTHY SAID THAT THAT WOULD INURE TO HIS BENEFIT BECAUSE HE WOULD THEN BE A RECOGNIZED FRIEND OF HIS DILWORTHY'S AND HE COULD CONSISTENTLY EXALT HIM POLITICALLY AND MAKE HIS FORTUNE
BLESS YOU NO
AND RUTH WOULD NOT BE AN ASSISTANT IN A PHILADELPHIA HOSPITAL TAXING HER STRENGTH WITH ARDUOUS ROUTINE DUTIES DAY BY DAY IN ORDER TO LIGHTEN A LITTLE THE BURDENS THAT WEIGH UPON HER UNFORTUNATE FAMILY
MR NOBLE--"SENATOR DILWORTHY YOUR BANK ACCOUNT SHOWS THAT UP TO THAT DAY AND EVEN ON THAT VERY DAY YOU CONDUCTED ALL YOUR FINANCIAL BUSINESS THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF CHECKS INSTEAD OF BILLS AND SO KEPT CAREFUL RECORD OF EVERY MONEYED TRANSACTION
THE TENDER SOLICITUDE OF HER MOTHER HER CHILDLIKE GRIEF AND HER FIRM BELIEF IN THE REAL GUILTLESSNESS OF HER DAUGHTER TOUCHED EVEN THE CUSTODIANS OF THE TOMBS WHO ARE ENURED TO SCENES OF PATHOS

SAY ABOUT THIS COLUMBUS RIVER APPROPRIATION SELLERS AND LAURA LAUGHED
THE THIRD YEAR WE COULD EASILY SELL 1,000,000 BOTTLES IN THE UNITED STATES AND O SPLENDID SAID WASHINGTON
BUT SHE DID NOT SOB OR UTTER ANY EJACULATION
DRIVES ON HAPPY AND CONTENT
AND THEY LOOKED MILES TO THE REAR AND SAW THE SILVERY HIGHWAY DIMINISH ITS BREADTH BY DEGREES AND CLOSE ITSELF TOGETHER IN THE DISTANCE
HE SHOULD MEET RUTH UNEXPECTEDLY AS SHE WAS WALKING ALONE FROM THE SCHOOL PERHAPS OR ENTERING THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS WAITING FOR HER AND SHE WOULD CRY OH
HERE--I MUST MIND WHAT I'M ABOUT
BUT HE WROTE THAT HIS MAN MIGHT PROBABLY RETURN TO THE CITY SOON AND THEN HE MEANT TO SELL TO HIM SURE EVEN IF HE HAD TO TAKE $10,000
YOU NATURALLY WISH TO VIEW THE CITY
WHY WILL FATHER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM
NOW THIS SURPRISING NEWS CAUS'D HER FALL IN A TRANCE LIFE AS SHE WERE DEAD NO LIMBS SHE COULD ADVANCE THEN HER DEAR BROTHER CAME HER FROM THE GROUND HE TOOK AND SHE SPAKE UP AND SAID O MY POOR HEART IS BROKE
KNEW COL
THE OLD MAN SPOKE THROUGH THE TUBE
HOW COULD YOU BE SO THOUGHTLESS--THE MEN OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN PAID THOUGH IT BEGGARED US ALL THEY OUGHT OUGHT THEY
THE MONUMENT IS TO BE FINISHED SOME DAY AND AT THAT TIME OUR WASHINGTON WILL HAVE RISEN STILL HIGHER IN THE NATION'S VENERATION AND WILL BE KNOWN AS THE GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER OF HIS COUNTRY
JUDGE HAWKINS AND COL
THE WEEK SEEMED VERY SHORT THAT HE PASSED IN HAWKEYE AND WHEN HE BADE LAURA GOOD BY HE SEEMED TO HAVE KNOWN HER A YEAR
IN TRUTH HE COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT HE WAS AN EFFICIENT SHIELD FOR HER AGAINST POVERTY
THEY COST LIKE SIN TOO
AND IF THE PEOPLE ONLY KNEW YOU AS I DO YOU WOULD NOT BE TAGGING AROUND HERE A NAMELESS MAN--YOU WOULD BE IN CONGRESS THE GLADNESS DIED OUT OF THE COLONEL'S FACE AND HE LAID HIS HAND UPON WASHINGTON'S SHOULDER AND SAID GRAVELY
EVERY TIME A NIGGER HEAVES A STICK OF WOOD INTO THE FURNACE HE GOES OUT THE CHIMNEY WITH IT THE AMARANTH DREW STEADILY UP TILL HER JACK-STAFF BREASTED THE BOREAS'S WHEEL-HOUSE--CLIMBED ALONG INCH BY INCH TILL HER CHIMNEYS BREASTED IT--CREPT ALONG FURTHER AND FURTHER TILL THE BOATS WERE WHEEL TO WHEEL--AND THEN THEY CLOSED UP WITH A HEAVY JOLT AND LOCKED TOGETHER TIGHT AND FAST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BIG RIVER UNDER THE FLOODING MOONLIGHT
I HEARD FATHER TELL COUSIN ABNER THAT HE WAS WHIPPED SO OFTEN FOR WHISTLING WHEN HE WAS A BOY THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE WHAT COMPENSATION HE COULD GET NOW THY WAYS GREATLY TRY ME RUTH AND ALL THY RELATIONS
I THINK I COULD ALWAYS ENJOY ICEBERGS--AS SCENERY BUT NOT AS COMPANY STILL SHE KNEW THESE TWO PEOPLE BY REPUTATION AND WAS AWARE THAT THEY WERE NOT ICE-BERGS WHEN THEY WERE IN THEIR OWN WATERS AND AMID THEIR LEGITIMATE SURROUNDINGS BUT ON THE CONTRARY WERE PEOPLE TO BE RESPECTED FOR THEIR STAINLESS CHARACTERS AND ESTEEMED FOR THEIR SOCIAL VIRTUES AND THEIR BENEVOLENT IMPULSES
AND HE HAD NOTICED ALSO THAT WHEN MIDNIGHT STRUCK THE PATIENT TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD THE DOOR WITH AN EXPECTANCY IN THEM WHICH PRESENTLY GREW INTO A LONGING BUT BRIGHTENED INTO CONTENTMENT AS SOON AS THE DOOR OPENED AND LAURA APPEARED
THE GIRLS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO WORK FOR A LIVING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHATEVER
THEY HAD PROBABLY BEEN BURNED
IT WAS A NEW BUT A DEAR JOY TO BE LIFTED UP AND CARRIED BACK INTO THE HAPPY WORLD WHICH WAS NOW ALL AGLOW WITH THE LIGHT OF LOVE
HE WAS A VILLAIN
IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO HEAR HIM TALK WHEN HIS HEART IS FULL OF THANKFULNESS FOR SOME MANIFESTATION OF THE DIVINE FAVOR
AND SHE WAS THE MOST GRATEFUL THING IN THIS WORLD--BUT IT WAS THE WRONG LEG AND IT WAS DAYS AND DAYS BEFORE SHE COULD LEAVE HER BED
BESIDES MR BIGLER HAD BEEN UNFORTUNATE HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE FOR HIS FAMILY
AND YOU BELIEVED THESE SLANDERS I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING AGAINST YOU LAURA BUT COL
WHAT IS THE C BEFORE SOME OF THE NAMES AND THE B
THE CONCERT WAS ONE OF THOSE FRAGMENTARY DREARINESSES THAT PEOPLE ENDURE BECAUSE THEY ARE FASHIONABLE
THE WHOLE AIR WAS FULL OF A VAGUE VAST SCHEME WHICH WAS TO EVENTUATE IN FILLING LAURA'S POCKETS WITH MILLIONS OF MONEY
EIGHTY-FIVE
TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE THIRD DAY'S JOURNEY THE WAYFARERS WERE JUST BEGINNING TO THINK OF CAMPING WHEN THEY CAME UPON A LOG CABIN IN THE WOODS
SENATOR WHEN VOTING WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN MR NOBLE ROSE IN HIS PLACE AND DREW FORTH A PACKAGE WALKED FORWARD AND LAID IT ON THE SPEAKER'S DESK SAYING THIS CONTAINS $7,000 IN BANK BILLS AND WAS GIVEN ME BY SENATOR DILWORTHY IN HIS BED-CHAMBER AT MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT TO BUY--MY VOTE FOR HIM--I WISH THE SPEAKER TO COUNT THE MONEY AND RETAIN IT TO PAY THE EXPENSE OF PROSECUTING THIS INFAMOUS TRAITOR FOR BRIBERY
NOTHING THAT HE REMEMBERED
WE HAVE MADE EVER SO MUCH PROGRESS IN A WEEK
INDIVIDUALS DENOUNCED IT JOURNALS DENOUNCED IT PUBLIC MEETINGS DENOUNCED IT THE PICTORIAL PAPERS CARICATURED ITS FRIENDS THE WHOLE NATION SEEMED TO BE GROWING FRANTIC OVER IT
AND BESIDES SUPPOSE THEE DOES LEARN MEDICINE I WILL PRACTICE IT HERE HERE WHERE THEE AND THY FAMILY ARE KNOWN IF I CAN GET PATIENTS I HOPE AT LEAST RUTH THEE WILL LET US KNOW WHEN THEE OPENS AN OFFICE SAID HER MOTHER WITH AN APPROACH TO SARCASM THAT SHE RARELY INDULGED IN AS SHE ROSE AND LEFT THE ROOM
SHE RUMMAGED LONG AMONG BOXES OF MUSTY PAPERS RELATING TO BUSINESS MATTERS OF NO INTEREST TO HER BUT AT LAST SHE FOUND SEVERAL BUNDLES OF LETTERS
IN THE EARLY TURMOIL AN HOUR AFTER THE EXPLOSION A LITTLE BLACK-EYED GIRL OF FIVE YEARS FRIGHTENED AND CRYING BITTERLY WAS STRUGGLING THROUGH THE THRONG IN THE BOREAS SALOON CALLING HER MOTHER AND FATHER BUT NO ONE ANSWERED
LOST ALSO
THE PRESIDENT LIKED TO HEAR THE COLONEL TALK HIS VOLUBLE EASE WAS A REFRESHMENT AFTER THE DECOROUS DULLNESS OF MEN WHO ONLY TALKED BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT AND EVERLASTINGLY EXPOUNDED THEIR NOTIONS OF JUSTICE AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF PATRONAGE
BY AND BY THE NEWSPAPERS CAME OUT WITH EXPOSURES AND CALLED WEED AND O'RILEY THIEVES,"--WHEREUPON THE PEOPLE ROSE AS ONE MAN VOTING REPEATEDLY AND ELECTED THE TWO GENTLEMEN TO THEIR PROPER THEATRE OF ACTION THE NEW YORK LEGISLATURE
AND HE SAID THAT PEOPLE LITTLE DREAMED WHAT A MAN COL
PENNYBACKER WAS IN WASHINGTON AND PHILIP THOUGHT HE MIGHT PERHAPS FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT HIM AND HIS PLANS THAT WOULD BE OF SERVICE TO MR BOLTON
ASSOCIATED WITH HIM AND ALSO OF THIS PARTY WAS RODNEY SCHAICK A SLEEK NEW YORK BROKER A MAN AS PROMINENT IN THE CHURCH AS IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE DAINTY IN HIS DRESS SMOOTH OF SPEECH THE NECESSARY COMPLEMENT OF DUFF BROWN IN ANY ENTERPRISE THAT NEEDED ASSURANCE AND ADROITNESS
HE DOUBTED IF THE COLUMBUS RIVER APPROPRIATION WOULD SUCCEED IF WE DID NOT INVOKE THE DIVINE BLESSING ON IT PERHAPS IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY TO THE READER THAT SENATOR DILWORTHY HAD NOT STAYED WITH COL
HOW LONG THEY SEEMED TO WAIT
IT IS EASY TO SEE HOW THINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER MANAGED
IT EVEN HAD ANOTHER QUESTION--THIS INTELLIGENT JURY--TO ASK THE JUDGE THIS MORNING
ALMOST AT THE DOOR SHE MET COL
WELL TO BRING ABOUT A COMPLEXION OF THINGS LIKE THIS WAS WORTH COMING WEST FOR CHAPTER LIV
THERE ARE MANY YOUNG MEN LIKE HIM IN AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HIS AGE OPPORTUNITIES EDUCATION AND ABILITIES WHO HAVE REALLY BEEN EDUCATED FOR NOTHING AND HAVE LET THEMSELVES DRIFT IN THE HOPE THAT THEY WILL FIND SOMEHOW AND BY SOME SUDDEN TURN OF GOOD LUCK THE GOLDEN ROAD TO FORTUNE
THERE NOW MR TROLLOP DID NOT SPRING TO HIS FEET AND SMITE HIS BROW WITH HIS HAND WHILE A COLD SWEAT BROKE OUT ALL OVER HIM AND THE COLOR FORSOOK HIS FACE--NO HE ONLY SAID GOOD GOD AND LOOKED GREATLY ASTONISHED
DO YOU KNOW THEIR HANDWRITING WHY I KNOW THEIR HANDWRITING AS WELL AS I KNOW MY OWN--HAVE HAD CORRESPONDENCE ENOUGH WITH THEM I SHOULD THINK
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL DO WASHINGTON WHEN YOU GET TO HAWKEYE
AND THEREFORE THE PORTIONS OF THE NARRATIVE CONTAINING THE RECORD OF THE SEARCH HAVE BEEN STRICKEN OUT
HE HAD NOT SPOKEN A WORD BUT HE FELT AS GUILTY AS IF SHE HAD CAUGHT HIM IN SOME SHAMEFUL ACT
THE PUBLICANS AND THEIR RETAINERS RULE THE WARD MEETINGS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE HATES THE WORRY OF POLITICS AND STAYS AT HOME
SHE WAS AWFUL DEEF--SHE'S DEAD NOW

FRENCH SOCIETY IS MUCH MORE ELEGANT--MUCH MORE SO LAURA--"I AM SORRY TO HEAR THAT

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLAIN TO ANY EYE THAT IT HAD COST SOMETHING TO UPHOLSTER THESE WOMEN
PATRICK O'RILEY AS HIS NAME THEN STOOD CREATED FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE VERY FAST FOR HE WAS ALWAYS ON HAND AT THE POLICE COURTS TO GIVE STRAW BAIL FOR HIS CUSTOMERS OR ESTABLISH AN ALIBI FOR THEM IN CASE THEY HAD BEEN BEATING ANYBODY TO DEATH ON HIS PREMISES
THEY STAID TO SUPPER HOWEVER AND IN THE EVENING PHILIP HAD A LONG TALK APART WITH RUTH A DELIGHTFUL HOUR TO HIM IN WHICH SHE SPOKE FREELY OF HERSELF AS OF OLD OF HER STUDIES AT PHILADELPHIA AND OF HER PLANS AND SHE ENTERED INTO HIS ADVENTURES AND PROSPECTS IN THE WEST WITH A GENUINE AND ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST
IT WAS NOT FOR ME TO ASSIST HIM OF COURSE
PHILIP HAD FOUND COAL
HE WENT TO WORK ON THE INSTANT
MEN SHOUTED WOMEN SCREAMED AND PANIC SEIZED THE SWAYING MASS
AND A LOOK OF BITTERNESS COMING INTO HER FACE--DOES THE FOOL THINK HE CAN ESCAPE SO
DON'T YOU SEE HOW OUR BAD LUCK HAS WORKED ON ME
IT OUGHT TO BE ATTACHED TO THE REAR CAR WHERE IT COULD DO SOME GOOD
SHE PONDERED A GOOD WHILE THAT NIGHT AFTER SHE HAD GONE TO BED AND WHEN SHE FINALLY TURNED OVER TO GO TO SLEEP SHE HAD THOUGHT OUT A NEW SCHEME
I AM A LECTURE-AGENT MISS HAWKINS AND AS SOON AS I SAW THAT YOU WERE ACQUITTED IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT AN EARLY INTERVIEW WOULD BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SIR SAID LAURA COLDLY
HE LIVES IN OUR FINE HOUSE AND WE LIVE IN HIS MISERABLE LOG CABIN
THE SUPREME MOMENT WAS COME NOW BUT SO SURE WAS THE RESULT THAT NOT EVEN A VOICE WAS RAISED TO INTERPOSE AN ADJOURNMENT
AND TO BE HUMAN IS TO HAVE ONE'S LITTLE MODICUM OF ROMANCE SECRETED AWAY IN ONE'S COMPOSITION
AND HARRY ACCEPTED IT MEEKLY AND MADE UP HIS OWN MIND THAT PHILIP DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WOMEN
THEN YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE STRETCH ALONG THROUGH BELSHAZZAR THAT DON'T PRODUCE ANYTHING NOW--AT LEAST NOTHING BUT ROCKS--BUT IRRIGATION WILL FETCH IT
SHE SAW PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT RUTH NEEDED AN ENTIRE CHANGE OF SCENE AND OF OCCUPATION AND PERHAPS SHE BELIEVED THAT SUCH A CHANGE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD IT WOULD BRING WOULD DIVERT RUTH FROM A COURSE FOR WHICH SHE FELT SHE WAS PHYSICALLY ENTIRELY UNFITTED
YES I THINK PERHAPS IT DID
HE WAS FOND OF MUSIC TOO IN A SYMPATHETIC WAY
THE TRUE WAY TO UPHOLD THE HONOR OF THE SENATE WAS TO HAVE NONE BUT HONORABLE MEN IN ITS BODY
JUST SO JUST SO
LAURA HAD GONE TO BE MARRIED
HE NEEDED NO ARTIFICIAL HEAT TO WARM HIS PEN AND KINDLE HIS ARDOR WHEN HE SAT DOWN TO WRITE TO RUTH
BUT DOWN THERE IS NOT UP HERE
AND THEN TOGETHER THEY WENT AWAY HAND IN HAND AND LEFT THE DEAD TO THE LONG SLEEP THAT HEALS ALL HEART-ACHES AND ENDS ALL SORROWS
BUT WHEN I SAY I MEAN TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU I MEAN SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT
I WILL KEEP IT CLOSE
AND WHAT IS MORE THEY WILL WORK LIKE BEAVERS FOR US--PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE TO THEIR ADVANTAGE HARRY REFLECTED PROFOUNDLY A WHILE
AND SUCH A WAY WITH HIM
A GOOD MANY PEOPLE WERE HURT SOME OF THEM SERIOUSLY AND AMONG THEM PHILIP STERLING WAS FOUND BENT ACROSS THE SEAT INSENSIBLE WITH HIS LEFT ARM HANGING LIMP AND A BLEEDING WOUND ON HIS HEAD
AND I MIGHT AS WELL SEE AN ARCHITECT TOO AND GET HIM TO GO TO WORK AT A PLAN FOR A HOUSE
I DO BEGIN TO DESPISE THIS WORLD SHE LAPSED INTO THOUGHT
IT CAN BE DONE THE COLONEL HITCHED UP HIS CHAIR CLOSE TO HARRY LAID HIS HAND ON HIS KNEE AND FIRST LOOKING ABOUT HIM SAID IN A LOW VOICE THE SALT LICK PACIFIC EXTENSION IS GOING TO RUN THROUGH STONE'S LANDING
SHE MUST END HER DOUBTS
INVITATIONS BEGAN TO FLOW IN UPON HER AND SOON SHE WAS FAIRLY IN SOCIETY THE SEASON WAS NOW IN FULL BLOOM AND THE FIRST SELECT RECEPTION WAS AT HAND--THAT IS TO SAY A RECEPTION CONFINED TO INVITED GUESTS
SLATTERNLY NEGRO GIRLS AND WOMEN SLOUCHED ALONG WITH PAILS DEFTLY BALANCED ON THEIR HEADS AND JOINED THE GROUP AND STARED

TUBBS AND HUFFY LEFT THE SINKING SHIP LAST NIGHT LATER ON
VISITORS CAME TO SEE HER AND GIFTS OF FRUIT AND FLOWERS WERE SENT WHICH BROUGHT SOME CHEER INTO HER HARD AND GLOOMY CELL
H STOOD ON END BY THE DOOR STRAPPED AND READY FOR A JOURNEY
HOW IS THAT WELL I DON'T
NOW FOR WORK AGAIN MY BOY
THE COLONEL REACHED FOR THE MESSAGE AND DEVOURED ITS CONTENTS
I GET MORE TIRED AND MORE DESPONDENT EVERY DAY
AND WOULD YOU WANT ME TO BE DEPENDENT PHILIP WELL YES A LITTLE SAID PHILIP FEELING HIS WAY TOWARDS WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY
DURING THE NIGHT SUBTLE ELECTRICITY HAD CARRIED THE TALE OVER ALL THE WIRES OF THE CONTINENT AND UNDER THE SEA
THE SALE OF THE HAWKINS PROPERTY BY THE SHERIFF HAD FOLLOWED AND THE HAWKINS HEARTS BEEN TORN TO SEE UNCLE DAN'L AND HIS WIFE PASS FROM THE AUCTION-BLOCK INTO THE HANDS OF A NEGRO TRADER AND DEPART FOR THE REMOTE SOUTH TO BE SEEN NO MORE BY THE FAMILY
CLAY BURIED HIS FACE IN THE COVERLET OF THE BED
WE WILL BE AS WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
STATESMEN WERE DULL CREATURES IN THOSE DAYS
MR DILWORTHY CONSIDERED HIS RE-ELECTION CERTAIN BUT HE WAS A CAREFUL PAINSTAKING MAN AND IF BY VISITING HIS STATE HE COULD FIND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERSUADE A FEW MORE LEGISLATORS TO VOTE FOR HIM HE HELD THE JOURNEY TO BE WELL WORTH TAKING
BY DEGREES LAURA AND HER MOTHER BEGAN TO SHOW WEAR BUT NEITHER OF THEM WOULD YIELD A MINUTE OF THEIR TASKS TO CLAY
A HALF DOZEN TENTS WERE PITCHED UNDER THE TREES HORSES AND OXEN WERE CORRALED AT A LITTLE DISTANCE AND A GROUP OF MEN SAT ON CAMP STOOLS OR LAY ON BLANKETS ABOUT A BRIGHT FIRE
INHERITING FROM HER FATHER AN ACTIVE BRAIN AND THE COURAGE TO UNDERTAKE NEW THINGS SHE HAD LITTLE OF HIS SANGUINE TEMPERAMENT WHICH BLINDS ONE TO DIFFICULTIES AND POSSIBLE FAILURES
IF I HAD SHOWN HIM A WHOLE BUSH HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS THE SAME
THAT'S MY NOTION
DO YOU THINK ANY THING CAN BE DONE SIR WAL I GUESS TAIN'T NO USE
IT'S MAJOR LACKLAND'S
GOOD MAWNING DRAWLED OUT THE SPOKESMAN OF THE PARTY
IT WAS A SOUTHERN FAMILY AND OF GOOD BLOOD
AND AFTER A TIME SHE WAS CALM AGAIN AND WENT TO HER BUREAU DRAWER AND TOOK FROM A HIDING PLACE A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER YELLOW WITH AGE
IT WAS AS NATURAL FOR THE DEAR BOY TO BE RICH AS IT IS FOR MOST PEOPLE TO BE POOR
SHE RETURNED TO HAWKEYE
AT A LITTLE AFTER THREE ON WEDNESDAY HE RANG THE BELL OF THE SENATOR'S RESIDENCE
AND WHEN THE DOCTOR GOT THERE LO AND BEHOLD YOU HE FOUND FRANCOIS HAD BROKE ONE OF HIS LEGS TOO EVERYBODY--"GOODNESS MRS O.--"YES
MR THOMPSON HAD BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO SAY THAT IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER HE WAS WITH THE CORPS OR NOT
IT WAS ME SIR THAT INDUCED SILAS HAWKINS JUDGE HAWKINS TO COME TO MISSOURI AND MAKE HIS FORTUNE
THAT'S THE STUFF
THE SENATOR HAD PLENTY OF RAILWAY PASSES AND COULD EASILY SPARE TWO TO LAURA--ONE FOR HERSELF AND ONE FOR A MALE ESCORT
AND THE COLONEL SAYS THAT
AND IF PHILIP HAD A LITTLE MONEY HE COULD UNLOCK THE STONE DOOR IN THE MOUNTAIN WHENCE WOULD ISSUE A STREAM OF SHINING RICHES
PRACTICE FIRST IN HAWKEYE THEN IN JEFFERSON THEN IN ST LOUIS THEN IN NEW YORK
TWO MILLIONS OR TWO AND A HALF WILL DO IT
HERE--JIM TOM PETE JAKE FLY AROUND
YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE WEST
WHEN THE EXTENT OF THE BIGLER SWINDLE WAS DISCLOSED THERE WAS NO MORE HOPE THAT MR BOLTON COULD EXTRICATE HIMSELF AND HE HAD AS AN HONEST MAN NO RESOURCE EXCEPT TO SURRENDER ALL HIS PROPERTY FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS CREDITORS
THERE'S YOUR ONIONS AT SLOUCHBURG--NOBLEST ONION COUNTRY THAT GRACES GOD'S FOOTSTOOL
HARRY HIMSELF BELIEVED THAT HE WAS OF GREAT SERVICE IN THE UNIVERSITY BUSINESS AND THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE SCHEME DEPENDED UPON HIM TO A GREAT DEGREE
THAT'S THE ROUTINE AND IT'S NO TRICK AT ALL TO A NEW YORK LAWYER
THEY RAN RACES UP AND DOWN THE DECK
FOLLOW IT WITHOUT SWERVING THROUGH ROCKS AND SHOALS THROUGH STORM AND CALM TO A HAVEN OF REST AND PEACE OR SHIPWRECK
SELLERS AN ENTHUSIASTIC AND HOSPITABLE GENTLEMAN VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY AND IN THEIR SUCCESS
HE USED TO SAY TO ME COL
THE COLONEL SAID THAT GENERAL BOSWELL WAS A RICH MAN AND HAD A GOOD AND GROWING BUSINESS
BERIAH SELLERS WAS BY THIS TIME ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN MEN IN WASHINGTON
IS IT POSSIBLE SHE WAS THINKING THAT THIS BASE WRETCH AFTER ALL HIS PROMISES WILL TAKE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND LEAVE ME
BUT I COULD SEE THAT HE WAS JEALOUS OF ME
BUCKSTONE--"MR CHAIRMAN I MOVE YOU SIR THAT THE WORDS THREE MILLIONS OF BE INSERTED MR HADLEY--"MR CHAIRMAN I MOVE THAT THE WORDS TWO AND A HALF DOLLARS BE INSERTED MR CLAWSON--"MR CHAIRMAN I MOVE THE INSERTION OF THE WORDS FIVE AND TWENTY CENTS AS REPRESENTING THE TRUE VALUE OF THIS BARREN AND ISOLATED TRACT OF DESOLATION THE QUESTION ACCORDING TO RULE WAS TAKEN UPON THE SMALLEST SUM FIRST
LITTLE HALF DRESSED WHITE BOYS AND LITTLE NEGRO BOYS WITH NOTHING WHATEVER ON BUT TOW-LINEN SHIRTS WITH A FINE SOUTHERN EXPOSURE CAME FROM VARIOUS DIRECTIONS AND STOOD WITH THEIR HANDS LOCKED TOGETHER BEHIND THEM AND AIDED IN THE INSPECTION
AND HE PROMISED AND LIED AND INVENTED FRESH EXCUSES FOR DELAY LIKE A COWARDLY GAMBLER AND ROUE AS HE WAS FEARING TO BREAK WITH HER AND HALF THE TIME UNWILLING TO GIVE HER UP
HE HAD BEEN ONCE OR TWICE TO DINE WITH COL
WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF THE COLONEL WAS GONE
I SHOULD WANT TO CHOOSE MY DOCTOR
A NEGRO WOMAN WAS BUSY COOKING AT A VAST FIRE-PLACE
SHE MAY HAVE HEARD DOUBTLESS SHE HAD SIMILAR THEORIES THAT WERE PREVALENT AT THAT DAY THEORIES OF THE TYRANNY OF MARRIAGE AND OF THE FREEDOM OF MARRIAGE
DREARINESS FLIMSINESS BAD TASTE REDUCED TO MATHEMATICAL COMPLETENESS IS WHAT THE INSIDE OFFERS TO THE EYE IF IT REMAINS YET WHAT IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN
IS IT THAT RAILROAD YES
SHE WAS MARRIED BUT SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED ON THAT VERY DAY OR THE NEXT THAT ALARMED HER
UPON INQUIRY IT APPEARED THAT LAURA HAD NOT BEEN AT DINNER EXCUSING HERSELF TO MRS DILWORTHY ON THE PLEA OF A VIOLENT HEADACHE
THAT MAN BIGLER HAS GOT FATHER INTO ANOTHER SPECULATION THAT ODIOUS MAN
HE PROMISED TO COME HERE AND HE HASN'T
THE HILLS ABOUNDED IN METALS OF ALL SORTS IRON IN ALL ITS COMBINATIONS COPPER BISMUTH GOLD AND SILVER IN SMALL QUANTITIES PLATINUM HE BELIEVED TIN ALUMINIUM
THEY ARE MOVING THIS WAY NOW
THINGS HAVE GOT PRETTY MIXED WHEN A LEGISLATURE WILL GIVE AWAY A UNITED STATES SENATORSHIP IT WAS MELANCHOLY BUT MR BIGLER WAS NOT A MAN TO BE CRUSHED BY ONE MISFORTUNE OR TO LOSE HIS CONFIDENCE IN HUMAN NATURE ON ONE EXHIBITION OF APPARENT HONESTY
YOUR OSTENTATIOUSLY CANDID BUSINESS MAN'S A DEEP FOX--ALWAYS A DEEP FOX
THAT MOVEMENT BEING WITHOUT RESULT WITH A SHADE OF DISAPPOINTMENT ON HIS FACE HE FELT IN HIS LEFT VEST POCKET
THE LITTLE LICKS I GOT IN IN THE COURSE OF MY ARGUMENT BEFORE THE JURY YOUR ARGUMENT
PROBABLY AT LAST HE SOMETIMES THOUGHT WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE HE SHOULD END BY BEING AN INSURANCE AGENT AND ASKING PEOPLE TO INSURE THEIR LIVES FOR HIS BENEFIT
NOW AND THEN SMALL LOG CABINS APPEARED IN LITTLE CLEARINGS WITH THE NEVER-FAILING FROWSY WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SOILED AND FADED LINSEY-WOOLSEY LEANING IN THE DOORS OR AGAINST WOODPILES AND RAIL FENCES GAZING SLEEPILY AT THE PASSING SHOW
IT WOULD TAKE THREE SHIPS TO CARRY THE MONEY.--I'VE LOOKED INTO THE THING--CALCULATED ALL THE CHANCES FOR AND ALL THE CHANCES AGAINST AND THOUGH I SHAKE MY HEAD AND HESITATE AND KEEP ON THINKING APPARENTLY I'VE GOT MY MIND MADE UP THAT IF THE THING CAN BE DONE ON A CAPITAL OF SIX MILLIONS THAT'S THE HORSE TO PUT UP MONEY ON
HE COULD STRIKE OUT FROM HIS LEFT SHOULDER
THE CONTRACTORS CALLED HIM INTO THEIR CONSULTATIONS FREQUENTLY AS TO THE CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY HE HAD BEEN OVER AND THE COST OF CONSTRUCTING THE ROAD THE NATURE OF THE WORK ETC
WHEN SHE HAD GAINED HER ROOM SHE WENT TO THE GLASS AND SAW A PALLID AND HAGGARD FACE
THE JURY WENT OUT
IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO SAY GIVE HER UP IF YOU DON'T CARE FOR HER
HAD SEEN HIM COME TO THE HOUSE OFTEN AND BE ALONE IN THE PARLOR WITH MISS HAWKINS
THE WALL STREET BROKERS ARE SAID TO DO A GOOD DEAL OF SMALL BUSINESS FOR COUNTRY CLERGYMEN WHO ARE MOVED NO DOUBT WITH THE LAUDABLE DESIRE OF PURIFYING THE NEW YORK STOCK BOARD
I KNOW YOUR HEARTS BY THIS TIME THE COLONEL HAD BECOME SO WARMED UP THAT HIS VOICE HAD REACHED A PITCH ABOVE THAT OF THE CONTENDING COUNSEL
YOU CAN'T PLEASE US ANY BETTER THAN THAT WASHINGTON
NO ONE APPARENTLY COULD ENTER MORE FULLY INTO HER PLANS FOR AN INDEPENDENT CAREER
RUTH MIGHT WELL SAY THAT SHE FELT AS IF SHE WERE LIVING IN A HOUSE OF CARDS ALTHOUGH THE BOLTON HOUSEHOLD HAD NO IDEA OF THE NUMBER OF PERILS THAT HOVERED OVER THEM ANY MORE THAN THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES IN AMERICA HAVE OF THE BUSINESS RISKS AND CONTINGENCES UPON WHICH THEIR PROSPERITY AND LUXURY HANG
CONGRESS BEGAN ITS SITTINGS AND EVERY DAY OR TWO WASHINGTON ESCORTED HER TO THE GALLERIES SET APART FOR LADY MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLDS OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES
LAURA WAS SERIOUSLY TROUBLED
IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM TO BE NEAR HER AND AVOID COMMITTING HIMSELF AS MUCH AS HE COULD
HE CONSIDERED SNOW IN WINTER PROPER
NO NO NO NOW I INSIST
LAFAYETTE,--[**IN THOSE OLD DAYS THE AVERAGE MAN CALLED HIS CHILDREN AFTER HIS MOST REVERED LITERARY AND HISTORICAL IDOLS
IT IS WEAK--PUERILE
I DON'T SEE THAT THERE IS MUCH RISK SAID THE SQUIRE AT LENGTH
A PROPOSAL WHICH WAS EAGERLY ACCEPTED
THE MOST AIRY SCHEME INFLATED IN THE HOT AIR OF THE CAPITAL ONLY REACHED IN MAGNITUDE SOME OF HIS LESSER FANCIES THE BY-PLAY OF HIS CONSTRUCTIVE IMAGINATION
RUTH HAD MET HIM WHEN HE FIRST CAME WITH A CORDIAL FRANKNESS AND HER MANNER CONTINUED ENTIRELY UNRESTRAINED
YOU'LL NEVER REGRET IT
I HAVE PERSUADED HIM TO WAIT A LITTLE WHILE AND GO WEST WHEN I GO ANOTHER LETTER HAD THIS PARAGRAPH IN IT
I GO FOR PUTTING THE OLD FLAG ON ALL THE VACANT LOTS
RUTH SAID HE ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS GETTING TO BE QUITE HIMSELF I BELIEVE IN IT BELIEVE IN WHAT WHY IN WOMEN PHYSICIANS THEN I'D BETTER CALL IN MRS DR LONGSTREET OH NO
THERE WERE DIAGRAMS ILLUSTRATING THE SCENE OF THE SHOOTING AND VIEWS OF THE HOTEL AND STREET AND PORTRAITS OF THE PARTIES
HE'D BE MISTAKEN
ONE NEVER CEASES TO MAKE A HERO OF ONE'S SELF IN PRIVATE DURING LIFE BUT ONLY ALTERS THE STYLE OF HIS HEROISM FROM TIME TO TIME AS THE DRIFTING YEARS BELITTLE CERTAIN GODS OF HIS ADMIRATION AND RAISE UP OTHERS IN THEIR STEAD THAT SEEM GREATER
PHILIP HAS GONE TO THE FAR WEST HOW FAR HE DOESN'T SAY BUT IT'S ON THE FRONTIER AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLATE AS A WEDNESDAY MEETING HUMPH
THERE WAS A MAJORITY--THE BILL WOULD PASS UNLESS WEAK MEMBERS GOT FRIGHTENED AT THE LAST AND DESERTED--A THING PRETTY LIKELY TO OCCUR
AND I HUMBLY THANK HIM TO WHOM WE ARE BUT AS WORMS OF THE DUST THAT HE HAS BEEN PLEASED TO CALL ME TO SERVE SUCH MEN
I THINK YOU ARE THE BEST SOUL AND THE NOBLEST I EVER KNEW COLONEL SELLERS
AND WHEN IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT HIS SURRENDER OF LAURA WOULD BE THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE ONE BARRIER THAT KEPT HER FROM RUIN IT WAS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT HE COULD SEE HOW TO GIVE HER UP
BUT THIS IS A DESPERATE GAME I AM PLAYING IN THESE DAYS--A WEARING SORDID HEARTLESS GAME
YOU MIGHT HAVE LOST HIM MRS O.--"O PRAY DON'T MENTION IT MISS HAWKINS--IT GIVES ME SUCH A TURN LAURA--"AND HILDEBRAND AND PERCY--ARE THEY--ARE THEY LIKE THIS ONE MRS G.--"NO HILLY HAS CONSIDERABLE SKYE BLOOD IN HIM I BELIEVE MRS H.--"PERCY'S THE SAME ONLY HE IS TWO MONTHS AND TEN DAYS OLDER AND HAS HIS EARS CROPPED
IT WAS NOT A VERY PROMISING STATE AND THE GOOD MAN FELT HOW MUCH LIGHTER HIS TASK WOULD BE IF HE HAD THE AID OF SUCH A MAN AS SENATOR DILWORTHY
THEN HE SMILED WITH AN ACCESS OF SWEETNESS UPON THE CHILDREN AND BEGAN
YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR PLACE HERE AMONG THESE GROPING DUMB CREATURES
BERIAH SELLERS MISSOURI WAS THE COURTEOUS ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE LAWYER WAS CORRECT
I SHOULD BE GLAD TO GIVE THE YOUNG FELLOW A LIFT ALL HIS LIFE ELI BOLTON HAD BEEN GIVING YOUNG FELLOWS A LIFT AND SHOULDERING THE LOSES WHEN THINGS TURNED OUT UNFORTUNATELY
HAVE NEITHER FORMED NOR EXPRESSED AN OPINION
PARTIES PICNICS ROWING-MATCHES MOONLIGHT STROLLS NUTTING EXPEDITIONS IN THE OCTOBER WOODS,--ALICE DECLARED THAT IT WAS A WHIRL OF DISSIPATION
HE DID IN FACT PRESS HIM TO DINE UPON THE MORNING OF THE DAY THE SENATOR WAS GOING AWAY
BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THE WORDS NEVER FLOWED SO EASILY BEFORE AND HE RAN ON FOR AN HOUR DISPORTING IN ALL THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HIS IMAGINATION
WHAT ELSE CAN WE GET FOR YOU LAURA SUGGESTED THAT SHE WOULD LIKE SOME SHEETS FOR HER BED A PIECE OF CARPET TO STEP ON AND HER MEALS SENT IN
SHE HAD FOLLOWED HIM WITH HER ATTENTIONS AND SOLICITATIONS AND HAD ENDEAVORED TO MAKE HIM DESERT HIS WIFE AND GO TO EUROPE WITH HER
YOUR PRIVATE SECRETARY NEVER COPIED YOUR SPEECH INDEED
MR BRAHAM OBJECTED
THE REST OF THE $10,000 WAS TO BE PAID THE DAY AFTER DILWORTHY WAS ELECTED
HE PUT A HAND UP OVER HIS SHOULDER AND FELT HIS BACK AND A GREAT THRILL SHOT THROUGH HIM
SIXTY-ONE
PERHAPS SHE SAW THAT HER OWN THEORIES OF A CERTAIN EQUALITY OF POWER WHICH OUGHT TO PRECEDE A UNION OF TWO HEARTS MIGHT BE PUSHED TOO FAR
AN ELDERLY SENATOR GOT UP AND TOOK ANOTHER VIEW OF THE CASE
POOR WASHINGTON GRADUALLY WOKE UP TO THE FACT THAT HE TOO WAS AN INTELLECTUAL MARVEL AS WELL AS HIS GIFTED SISTER
THEIR COSTUMES AS TO ARCHITECTURE WERE THE LATEST FASHION INTENSIFIED
I SAID TO THE PRESIDENT SAYS I GRANT WHY DON'T YOU TAKE SANTO DOMINGO ANNEX THE WHOLE THING AND SETTLE THE BILL AFTERWARDS
HERE JERRY GOT ANYTHING TO DO
WHY DIDN'T YOU KEEP YOUR PROMISE THE MATTER WAS NOT OF SUFFICIENT CONSEQUENCE
THERE AIN'T ANOTHER CLOCK LIKE THAT IN CHRISTENDOM WASHINGTON HOPED THAT THIS MIGHT BE TRUE FOR THE DIN WAS DISTRACTING--THOUGH THE FAMILY ONE AND ALL SEEMED FILLED WITH JOY
BUT IF ONE MIGHT COME HERE INDEED YOU WOULD ALWAYS FIND A HEARTY WELCOME MR BUCKSTONE
HE REMEMBERED THE FATE OF THE BAD LITTLE BOY WHO USED TO TRY TO GET HIM TO PLAY ON SUNDAY AND WHO GREW UP AND BECAME A DRUNKARD AND WAS HANGED
SO OF COURSE THE THING IS NOT PROVEN--AND THAT IS WHAT THEY SAY IN THE VERDICT
LAURA THOUGHT THIS BELIEVED IT
SULTRINESS IN SUMMER LEGITIMATE
AND IT APPROPRIATED BLANK DOLLARS FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE LAND WHICH SHOULD BE THE PROPERTY OF THE NATIONAL TRUSTEES IN TRUST FOR THE USES NAMED
THERE WAS NO WORK TO DO
FOR INSTANCE IT IS CUSTOMARY IN ALL COUNTRIES FOR BUSINESS MEN TO LOAN LARGE SUMS OF MONEY IN BANK BILLS INSTEAD OF CHECKS
IT CONSISTED OF ABUNDANCE OF CLEAR FRESH WATER AND A BASIN OF RAW TURNIPS--NOTHING MORE
SELBY'S DESERTION SHE WAS ALMOST DEAD NEVER APPEARED TO KNOW ANYTHING RIGHTLY FOR WEEKS
YOU CAN DO MORE FOR HER NOW SIR THAN I CAN HOW ASKED PHILIP EAGERLY
SELLERS WAS CONDUCTED TO THIS CELL BY THE MATRON AND LOOKED IN HIS EMOTIONS QUITE OVERCAME HIM THE TEARS ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED SO THAT HE COULD HARDLY SPEAK
IT WAS NEW FOR RUTH TO FEEL THIS DEPENDENCE ON ANOTHER'S NATURE TO CONSCIOUSLY DRAW STRENGTH OF WILL FROM THE WILL OF ANOTHER
AFTER THE COLONEL TOOK HIS LEAVE THE GENERAL TALKED A WHILE WITH WASHINGTON--HIS TALK CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT THE CLERICAL DUTIES OF THE PLACE
BUT THE MINUTE OUR BILL WENT THROUGH THE HOUSE I WAS COL
HE COULD ONLY TALK DISJOINTEDLY
CLUSTERED ABOUT THEIR FATHER AND RESTING THEIR ELBOWS ON HIS LEGS THEY HUNG UPON HIS WORDS AS IF HE WERE UTTERING THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES
SO MAKE YOURSELF PERFECTLY EASY MOTHER-IN A LITTLE WHILE YOU SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT AND MORE
THIS WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM HARRY'S USUAL TONE ABOUT WOMEN THAT PHILIP WONDERED A GOOD DEAL OVER IT
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT IF I THROW MY TIME AND ABILITIES INTO A PATENT MEDICINE IT'S A PATENT MEDICINE WHOSE FIELD OF OPERATIONS IS THE SOLID EARTH
A VERY LITTLE CHANGE HERE AND THERE WOULD HAVE MADE A VERY DIFFERENT HISTORY OF THIS ONE NOW IN HAND
WHEN THE BLACKEST HOUR COMES PROVIDENCE ALWAYS COMES WITH IT--AH THIS IS THE VERY TIMELIEST HELP THAT EVER POOR HARRIED DEVIL HAD
I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE LIFT
BUT A SECOND'S THOUGHT WAS NOT GIVEN
IT'S EASY ENOUGH
THAT IS THE WAY THE WORLD WILL WORD IT
THEY WERE MR BRAHAM THE SENIOR AND MR QUIGGLE AND MR O'KEEFE THE JUNIORS
AFTER ALL THE COLONEL'S DEEP PLANNING
HE LIT A CANDLE AND GROPED HIS WAY IN
THEY WERE STANDING FIRMLY BY HIM AND WERE FULL OF COURAGE
SOME THINKS HE'S GWYNE TO BE LONG TORECKLY AND SOME THINKS E HAIN'T
RUTH'S EYES WERE CLOSED
IF YOU APPLY FOR A HOME IN ONE OF THEM IT WILL SEEM ODD TO YOU TO HAVE THE LANDLADY INSPECT YOU WITH A SEVERE EYE AND THEN ASK YOU IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS
THERE WAS NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT IT WAS THE HARD SHINING ANTHRACITE AND ITS FRESHLY FRACTURED SURFACE GLISTENED IN THE LIGHT LIKE POLISHED STEEL
GIVE IT TO ME PLEASE AND FORGET THE MATTER IT WOULD NOT BE KIND TO REFUSE SINCE IT TROUBLES YOU SO AND SO I RESTORE IT
THIS NOT BEING AN EDITION OF THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE SENATOR DILWORTHY'S SPEECH IN FULL
THE REST OF HIS CLOTHING WAS NAPLESS AND SHINY TOO BUT IT HAD THE AIR OF BEING ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH ITSELF AND BLANDLY SORRY FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES
DEAR MR BRIERLY:--CAN YOU MEET ME AT THE SIX O'CLOCK TRAIN AND BE MY ESCORT TO NEW YORK
THE MOST RENOWNED AND POPULAR HOTEL OF THEM ALL IS PERHAPS THE WORST ONE KNOWN TO HISTORY
BOTH APPEARED TO BE NON-PLUSSED
YOU KNOW HOW DEARLY I LOVE YOU
PHILIP SENT COPIES OF HIS PERFORMANCES TO RUTH'S FATHER AND TO OTHER GENTLEMEN WHOSE GOOD OPINION HE COVETED BUT HE DID NOT REST UPON HIS LAURELS
AN D'YOU SPEC HE GWYNE TO LET EM OFF DOUT SOMEBODY AST HIM TO DO IT
FOR INSTANCE THERE WAS THE SENATOR'S CHECK FOR $2,000--"TO BUY SUITABLE CLOTHING IN NEW YORK WITH IT WAS A LOAN TO BE REFUNDED WHEN THE LAND WAS SOLD
THE ROOM HAD BUT ONE WINDOW
PHIL AND THEN CHECK HERSELF AND PERHAPS BLUSH AND PHILIP CALM BUT EAGER AND ENTHUSIASTIC WOULD REASSURE HER BY HIS WARM MANNER AND HE WOULD TAKE HER HAND IMPRESSIVELY AND SHE WOULD LOOK UP TIMIDLY AND AFTER HIS LONG ABSENCE PERHAPS HE WOULD BE PERMITTED TO GOOD HEAVENS HOW MANY TIMES HE HAD COME TO THIS POINT AND WONDERED IF IT COULD HAPPEN SO
WHY I THOUGHT THAT LONG BRANCH THERE WAS NO NEED TO FEEL ANY FURTHER--THERE WAS THAT IN BOTH FACES BEFORE HER WHICH MADE THAT TRUTH APPARENT
THE LECTURE AGENT APPEARED AT THE DOOR
IT SEEMS TO BE EASIER THAN IT IS I BEGIN TO THINK REPLIED PHILIP
ONE BEGAN IN THIS SIMPLE MANNER HISTORY NEVER REPEATS ITSELF BUT THE KALEIDOSCOPIC COMBINATIONS OF THE PICTURED PRESENT OFTEN SEEM TO BE CONSTRUCTED OUT OF THE BROKEN FRAGMENTS OF ANTIQUE LEGENDS
IT WAS A RAY OF SUNSHINE WHICH TO THIS EASY HOUSEHOLD WAS THE EARNEST OF A CLEARING SKY
AS HE WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH TO THE PULPIT ON THE ARM OF THE MINISTER AND FOLLOWED BY THE ENVIED OFFICIALS OF THE VILLAGE EVERY NECK WAS STRETCHED AND EVERY EYE TWISTED AROUND INTERVENING OBSTRUCTIONS TO GET A GLIMPSE
THE RAILROAD COMPANY OWNS ALL THESE PEOPLE ALONG HERE AND THE JUDGES ON THE BENCH TOO
MUCH AS I AM INTERESTED IN THE HEIRS OF THIS PROPERTY AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM SUCCEED LAURA LOOKED A LITTLE INCREDULOUS AND THE SENATOR PROCEEDED
SOME PEOPLE JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT--YOU HAVE NOTICED THAT O YES SAID THE CLERK A LITTLE PERPLEXED AS TO WHETHER TO FEEL COMFORTABLE OR THE REVERSE
LIVING WITH HER FAMILY IN A CHEAP AND MOST UNATTRACTIVE FRAME HOUSE SUCH AS CARPENTERS BUILD IN AMERICA SCANTILY FURNISHED AND UNADORNED
COME NOW BUNDLE RIGHT ALONG WITH ME
HE SAYS THE LATTER STATEMENT IS UNTRUE AND DOES ME GREAT INJUSTICE AFTER AN UNCONSCIOUS SARCASM LIKE THAT FURTHER COMMENT IS UNNECESSARY AND YET THE SENATE WAS ROUSED BY THE DILWORTHY TROUBLE
DID SHE CARE FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT HER PROFESSION
THE FAMILY BORE THE SACRIFICE BETTER THAN HE DID
SURE ENOUGH THE LORD WAS JUST TURNING A POINT A SHORT DISTANCE UP THE RIVER AND WHILE THEY LOOKED THE LIGHTS WINKED OUT AND THE COUGHING DIMINISHED BY DEGREES AND PRESENTLY CEASED ALTOGETHER
THE LAW TOOK ITS COURSE WITH LAURA
BUT IT ALWAYS TURNED OUT THAT THE LACKING INGREDIENT WAS STILL LACKING--THOUGH IT ALWAYS APPEARED AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE COLONEL WAS RIGHT ON ITS HEELS
YOU HAVE MY CARD LAURA BOWED
THE COLONEL TORE IT OPEN AND READ WITH THE VOICE OF A MAN-OF-WAR'S BROADSIDE
AFTER THE TRAIN GOT OUT OF THE WAY HE CRAWLED OUT OF THE BRIARS AND THE MUD AND GOT UPON THE TRACK
HAWKINS STEPPED WITHIN
SOME INSTINCT HAD TOLD HIM FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THIS WAS A BAD MAN AN EVIL-MINDED MAN BUT HIS INEXPERIENCE OF SUCH HAD BLINDED HIM TO HIS REAL MOTIVES AND HENCE HE HAD NEVER DREAMED THAT HIS OBJECT WAS TO UNDERMINE THE PURITY OF A UNITED STATES SENATOR
WELL WHO COULD HAVE BELIEVED IT
SHE THEN ADVANCED A STEP
HIS FATHER MARTIN FARQUHAR TUPPER WAS SICKLY AND DIED YOUNG BUT HE WAS THE SWEETEST DISPOSITION.--HIS MOTHER HAD HEART DISEASE BUT WAS VERY GENTLE AND RESIGNED AND A WONDERFUL RATTER AS IMPOSSIBLE AND EXASPERATING AS THIS CONVERSATION MAY SOUND TO A PERSON WHO IS NOT AN IDIOT IT IS SCARCELY IN ANY RESPECT AN EXAGGERATION OF ONE WHICH ONE OF US ACTUALLY LISTENED TO IN AN AMERICAN DRAWING ROOM--OTHERWISE WE COULD NOT VENTURE TO PUT SUCH A CHAPTER INTO A BOOK WHICH PROFESSES TO DEAL WITH SOCIAL POSSIBILITIES.--THE AUTHORS SO CARRIED AWAY HAD THE VISITORS BECOME BY THEIR INTEREST ATTACHING TO THIS DISCUSSION OF FAMILY MATTERS THAT THEIR STAY HAD BEEN PROLONGED TO A VERY IMPROPER AND UNFASHIONABLE LENGTH
SHE HERSELF WAS NOT WITHOUT MONEY FOR THE WASHINGTON LOBBYIST IS NOT SELDOM MORE FORTUNATE THAN THE WASHINGTON CLAIMANT AND SHE WAS ABLE TO PROCURE A GOOD MANY LUXURIES TO MITIGATE THE SEVERITY OF HER PRISON LIFE
COMPARED WITH SOME OTHER SUBJECTS EVEN YOUR BILL IS A PLEASANT TOPIC TO DISCUSS VERY GOOD INDEED
THE WHOLE STREET WAS PACKED WITH PEOPLE AND SHE COULD HARDLY FORCE HER WAY TO THE HALL
PERHAPS IT WAS BY THEIR ADVICE THAT LAURA HAD INTERESTED HERSELF IN THE UNFORTUNATE CRIMINALS WHO SHARED HER PRISON CONFINEMENT AND HAD DONE NOT A LITTLE TO RELIEVE FROM HER OWN PURSE THE NECESSITIES OF SOME OF THE POOR CREATURES
YOU CAN'T REFER A HANDSOME WOMAN SO EASILY WHEN SHE IS PRESENT
BUT HE WAS BORN INTO A TIME WHEN ALL YOUNG MEN OF HIS AGE CAUGHT THE FEVER OF SPECULATION AND EXPECTED TO GET ON IN THE WORLD BY THE OMISSION OF SOME OF THE REGULAR PROCESSES WHICH HAVE BEEN APPOINTED FROM OF OLD
PHILIP WAS AT HOME--HE SOMETIMES WISHED HE WERE NOT SO MUCH SO
22
WAS SATISFIED AND TOOK REFUGE WITH HIM
NOBODY HAS MORE INFLUENCE AT HARRISBURG
OH IT IS A FEARFUL THING TO BE POOR
WILL IT BE MILLIONS YES YOU MAY CALL IT THAT
AT THE TIME OF THIS HISTORY PHILIP HAD GONE TO NEW YORK FOR A CAREER
AND WHAT SORT OF A HOME WOULD THAT MAKE FOR YOUR HUSBAND WHAT SORT OF A HOME IS IT FOR THE WIFE WHOSE HUSBAND IS ALWAYS AWAY RIDING ABOUT IN HIS DOCTOR'S GIG AH YOU KNOW THAT IS NOT FAIR
HERE HE IS POLLY
THE WORLD WAS ALL BEFORE HIM WHERETO CHOOSE
IT WAS A PLAIN ENOUGH CASE FOR THE JURY BUT THEY SAT OVER IT A LONG TIME LISTENING TO THE WRANGLING OF THE PHYSICIANS
IF I FOUND ANYTHING IT WOULD ONLY BE ONE OF THOSE LITTLE AGGRAVATING SEAMS OF COAL WHICH DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING AND BY THIS TIME HE WAS WALKING OUT OF THE TUNNEL
SCHOONMAKER WAS NOT EXACTLY A LEADER IN THE HOUSE BUT HE WAS GREATLY RESPECTED FOR HIS FINE TALENTS AND HIS HONESTY
STILL I WON'T SAY BUT WHAT SOME OF THEM ARE VERY GOOD PEOPLE--AND RESPECTABLE TOO LAURA--"THE OLD FAMILIES SEEM TO BE HOLDING THEMSELVES ALOOF FROM WHAT I HEAR
I AM CERTAIN THAT I OVERHEARD THE HON
IT'S NOBODY IT'S NOTHING
SHE BELONGS TO A HIGH SOUTHERN FAMILY AND HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING AN HEIRESS
WHEN HE RESISTED AND AVOIDED HER SHE HAD THREATENED HIM
WITHIN THE BAR THE YOUNG LAWYERS AND THE PRIVILEGED HANGERS-ON FILLED ALL THE CHAIRS EXCEPT THOSE RESERVED AT THE TABLE FOR THOSE ENGAGED IN THE CASE
WHY SHE WANTED ME TO COME
HE'S GOT HIS PLANS SIR
DIDN'T HE MAKE AN OFFER OFFER
IT IS WHISPERED THAT THE HON
GREAT-GRANDMOTHER DIED BEFORE HARDLY ANY OF US WAS BORN--SHE WAS AN OLD-SCHOOL BAPTIST AND HAD WARTS ALL OVER HER--YOU ASK FATHER IF SHE DIDN'T
SHE DID NOT BY ANY MEANS SHARE ALL THE DELUSION OF THE FAMILY
RAILROAD SURVEYING AND REAL-ESTATE OPERATIONS WERE AT A STANDSTILL DURING THE WINTER IN MISSOURI AND THE YOUNG MEN HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE LULL TO COME EAST PHILIP TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY DISPOSITION IN HIS FRIENDS THE RAILWAY CONTRACTORS TO GIVE HIM A SHARE IN THE SALT LICK UNION PACIFIC EXTENSION AND HARRY TO OPEN OUT TO HIS UNCLE THE PROSPECTS OF THE NEW CITY AT STONE'S LANDING AND TO PROCURE CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE HARBOR AND FOR MAKING GOOSE RUN NAVIGABLE
BUT IT DOES DO GOOD
THEY WERE HOLDING THE BOAT SO CLOSE TO THE SHORE THAT THE WILLOWS SWEPT THE GUARDS ALMOST FROM STEM TO STERN
AND IT IS A GOOD THING FOR THE HAWKINS HEIRS A VERY GOOD THING
IT IS OUR BUSINESS GENTLEMEN TO SEE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE
LAURA LOVED HIM AND BELIEVED THAT HIS LOVE FOR HER WAS AS PURE AND DEEP AS HER OWN
THENCE RIGHT ALONG THESE SHEARS TO THIS HORSE BABYLON
BY DAYLIGHT WITH PHILIP'S LETTERS TO THE MAIL WORD HAD GONE DOWN TO ILIUM THAT COAL HAD BEEN FOUND AND VERY EARLY A CROWD OF EAGER SPECTATORS HAD COME UP TO SEE FOR THEMSELVES
NO INDEED
NO INDEED
THE IDEA OF HER PINNING THAT PAPER ON A MAN AND STANDING HIM UP IN THE ROTUNDA LOOKS ABSURD AT A FIRST GLANCE
SAME OLD--WHY BLESS MY LIFE IT WAS ONLY JEST THIS VERY MORNING THAT MY WIFE SAYS COLONEL'--SHE WILL CALL ME COLONEL SPITE OF EVERYTHING I CAN DO--SHE SAYS COLONEL SOMETHING TELLS ME SOMEBODY'S COMING AND SURE ENOUGH HERE YOU ARE THE LAST PEOPLE ON EARTH A BODY COULD HAVE EXPECTED
NONSENSE WON'T DO IN HAWKEYE NOT WITH MY FRIENDS
NOBLE WISHED TO GET THE MONEY AND TAKE IT TO HIM
THEY LIT THEIR PIPES PUT A SPECIMEN OF THE COAL ON THE TABLE AND MADE IT A KIND OF LOADSTONE OF THOUGHT AND CONVERSATION
THEY WERE BUT LITTLE HAMPERED BY THE FACT THAT THE MEMORANDA REFERRED TO BETRAYED NOTHING BUT THE BARE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT LAURA'S REAL PARENTS WERE UNKNOWN AND STOPPED THERE
SO SPEEDILY DO WE PUT THE DEAD AWAY AND COME BACK TO OUR PLACE IN THE RANKS TO MARCH IN THE PILGRIMAGE OF LIFE AGAIN
THE COURT THEN TOOK A RECESS FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS
IF RUTH WAS EVER IN THE CITY HE SHOULD BE HAPPY TO PLACE HIS BOX AT THE DISPOSAL OF RUTH AND HER FRIENDS
READ THAT HE CRIED PHILIP HAS FOUND COAL THE WORLD WAS CHANGED IN A MOMENT
IT WOULD GIVE HER EMPLOYMENT MONEY
THIS VISION SWEPT WASHINGTON'S MIND CLEAR OF ITS CHAOS OF GLITTERING RUBBISH IN AN INSTANT
MADE FRIENDS WITH THE PASSENGER-DOGS CHAINED UNDER THE LIFEBOAT
TAKE THAT TEAM TO MY PLACE--PUT THE WAGON IN MY LOT--PUT THE HORSES UNDER THE SHED AND GET OUT HAY AND OATS AND FILL THEM UP
OCEANS OF MONEY IN IT--ANYBODY COULD SEE THAT
IT WAS A BRIGHT SPRING MORNING THE AIR WAS SOFT AND INSPIRING
SELLERS DID NOT OF COURSE LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPRESS UPON SO INFLUENTIAL A PERSON AS THE SENATOR THE DESIRABILITY OF IMPROVING THE NAVIGATION OF COLUMBUS RIVER
BUT THEY WERE ONLY WORDS--HE COULD NOT GET ANY HEART INTO THEM
HE WROTE SOME PAPERS AT THIS TIME FOR THE PLOW THE LOOM AND THE ANVIL UPON THE STRENGTH OF MATERIALS AND ESPECIALLY UPON BRIDGE-BUILDING WHICH ATTRACTED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION AND WERE COPIED INTO THE ENGLISH PRACTICAL MAGAZINE THEY SERVED AT ANY RATE TO RAISE PHILIP IN THE OPINION OF HIS FRIENDS THE CONTRACTORS FOR PRACTICAL MEN HAVE A CERTAIN SUPERSTITIOUS ESTIMATION OF ABILITY WITH THE PEN AND THOUGH THEY MAY A LITTLE DESPISE THE TALENT THEY ARE QUITE READY TO MAKE USE OF IT
IF WE SECURE HIM WE SHALL HAVE A FAVORABLE REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE AND IT WILL BE A GREAT THING TO BE ABLE TO STATE THAT FACT QUIETLY WHERE IT WILL DO GOOD OH I SAW SENATOR BALLOON HE WILL HELP US I SUPPOSE
AFTER THE HEAT AND NOISE OF THE CHAMBER UNDER ITS DULL GAS-ILLUMINATED GLASS CANOPY AND THE ALL NIGHT STRUGGLE OF PASSION AND FEVERISH EXCITEMENT THERE THE OPEN TRANQUIL WORLD SEEMED LIKE HEAVEN
THIS WAS BUT THE SECOND SESSION OF THE LAST WINTER'S CONGRESS AND ITS ACTION ON THE BILL COULD HAVE BUT ONE RESULT--ITS PASSAGE
SHOCKING MURDER
PRESENTLY SHE SAID
HE CONSIDERED $5,000 A FORTUNE--FOR SOME MEN
VERY STRANGE I MUST CHANCE TO MEET HIM TO-DAY LAURA DRESSED AND WENT OUT THINKING SHE WAS PERHAPS TOO EARLY FOR MR BUCKSTONE TO COME FROM THE HOUSE BUT AS HE LODGED NEAR THE BOOKSTORE SHE WOULD DROP IN THERE AND KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR HIM
COME SAID WASHINGTON
SHE WAS URGED ON BY A FEVER OF LOVE AND HATRED AND JEALOUSY WHICH ALTERNATELY POSSESSED HER
THAT IS WHAT SHE IS
I DO RECKON HE IS THE BEST FRIEND THE COLORED MAN HAS GOT IN WASHINGTON THOUGH HARRY WAS IN A HURRY TO REACH WASHINGTON HE STOPPED IN PHILADELPHIA
WHAT'S TO BE DONE SAID THE COLONEL
I'D BET A HUNDRED DOLLARS HE WILL ANTE HIS WAY RIGHT INTO THE UNITED STATES SENATE WHEN HIS TERRITORY COMES IN
SHE MIGHT YET HAVE BEEN HAPPY
SELLERS AS GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT OF A GREAT PUBLIC ENTERPRISE WAS ALL THAT A MERE HUMAN BEING COULD BE--AND MORE
IF COL
BY THE MARK TWAIN QUAR--TER--HER--ER--LESS TWAIN EIGHT AND A HALF EIGHT FEET SEVEN-ANA-HALF ANOTHER JINGLING OF LITTLE BELLS AND THE WHEELS CEASED TURNING ALTOGETHER
I ASK ONLY THAT JUSTICE WHICH YOU AND I SHALL NEED IN THAT LAST DREADFUL HOUR WHEN DEATH WILL BE ROBBED OF HALF ITS TERRORS IF WE CAN REFLECT THAT WE HAVE NEVER WRONGED A HUMAN BEING
THE EVENTFUL NIGHT CAME
WASHINGTON IS NOT CORINTH AND LAIS THE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER OF TIMANDRA MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THE PROTOTYPE OF THE RAVISHING LAURA DAUGHTER OF THE PLEBEIAN HOUSE OF HAWKINS
I EXPECTED BETTER THINGS AT THEIR HANDS--AND TIME IS PRECIOUS NOW AT THE PROPER HOUR ACCORDING TO HIS PREVIOUS NOTICE MR BUCKSTONE DULY INTRODUCED HIS BILL ENTITLED AN ACT TO FOUND AND INCORPORATE THE KNOBS INDUSTRIAL UNIVERSITY MOVED ITS PROPER REFERENCE AND SAT DOWN
WHY ALL THESE QUESTIONS
FOR HE WAS COMING IN SPITE OF A LETTER FROM HARRY IN NEW YORK ADVISING HIM TO HOLD ON UNTIL HE HAD MADE SOME ARRANGEMENTS IN REGARD TO CONTRACTS HE TO BE A LITTLE CAREFUL ABOUT SELLERS WHO WAS SOMEWHAT VISIONARY HARRY SAID
LAURA WAS TROUBLED BEYOND MEASURE AT THEIR TONE AND SAID THAT THAT SORT OF COMMENT WOULD DEFEAT THE BILL
HE COULD NOT ALWAYS WARM UP NOW WITH THE OLD HAWKEYE FERVOR
PERHAPS WHO KNOWS SAID HE WITH A SMILE HE MAY HAVE GOT SOME OF MY COTTON IN EXCHANGE FOR SALT AND QUININE AFTER THE CAPTURE OF NEW ORLEANS
EVERYBODY WILL WANT TO KNOW YOU
I WONDER SAID RUTH WHAT THE GIRLS DANCING THERE WOULD THINK IF THEY SAW US OR KNEW THAT THERE WAS SUCH A ROOM AS THIS SO NEAR THEM SHE DID NOT SPEAK VERY LOUD AND PERHAPS UNCONSCIOUSLY THE GIRLS DREW NEAR TO EACH OTHER AS THEY APPROACHED THE LONG TABLE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM
IT DRAGGED ALONG STUPIDLY ENOUGH THEN--TILL IT CAME IN SIGHT OF THE NEXT HAMLET
AND AS TO ITS BEING HER FIRST VISIT WHY BANG IT SHE KNOWS THAT I KNEW IT WAS
A STAGE GOES FROM SWANSEA FIVE MILES FROM HERE
THEY IMPROVED THE OPPORTUNITY WITH A TOUCHING SELF-SACRIFICE
MANY PAPERS USED LANGUAGE TO THIS EFFECT
WE LIKE HIM VERY MUCH
I SHALL HAVE TO CALL ALICE TO RAISE YOUR SPIRITS
WASN'T IT THE BROADEST AND THE LONGEST STREET IN THE WORLD
THAT POOR LITTLE BOY THAT LOVED HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL BECAME THAT MAN
UPON MY TONGUES CONTINUAL SLANDERS RIDE
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE I AM STAYING IN HAWKEYE FOR WEEK AFTER WEEK WHEN I OUGHT TO BE WITH MY CORPS I SUPPOSE IT'S YOUR BUSINESS WITH COL
CAIN'T MAKE A LIVIN HERE NO MO SICH TIMES AS THESE
THE FIRST YEAR SELL SAY TEN THOUSAND BOTTLES IN MISSOURI SEVEN THOUSAND IN IOWA THREE THOUSAND IN ARKANSAS FOUR THOUSAND IN KENTUCKY SIX THOUSAND IN ILLINOIS AND SAY TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
BUT THEY MADE THE MISTAKE OF WAITING TO HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY FIRST
PHILIP WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE CONTENT WITH LESS EXPENSIVE QUARTERS BUT THERE WAS NO RESISTING HARRY'S GENEROSITY IN SUCH MATTERS
SHE COMPLAINED THAT HER MOTHER DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HER
SELBY HE SAID BELONGED GENTLEMEN
DURING THIS TIME SHE HAD EXPERIENCED--FIRST TWO OR THREE DAYS OF TRIUMPH EXCITEMENT CONGRATULATIONS A SORT OF SUNBURST OF GLADNESS AFTER A LONG NIGHT OF GLOOM AND ANXIETY
WE HEARD YOU WERE AT THE SASSACUS HOUSE WERE RUTH'S FIRST WORDS
THE COLONEL WANTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT AND HICKS TOLD HIM
SHE WAS ABLE TO TELL HIM EXACTLY HOW THE HOUSE WOULD VOTE
UPON ALL THESE OCCASIONS THE SENATOR MADE CASUAL REFERENCES TO MANY BENEVOLENT ENTERPRISES WHICH HIS ARDENT YOUNG FRIEND WAS PLANNING AGAINST THE DAY WHEN THE PASSAGE OF THE UNIVERSITY BILL SHOULD MAKE HIS MEANS AVAILABLE FOR THE AMELIORATION OF THE CONDITION OF THE UNFORTUNATE AMONG HIS FELLOW MEN OF ALL NATIONS AND ALL CLIMES
THA WARN'T NO SICH THING AS SAVING OF HER
HE WANTS REASONS GOOD ONES
IT SO HAPPENED SAID THE SENATOR THAT ABOUT THE TIME IN QUESTION A POOR YOUNG FRIEND OF MINE LIVING IN A DISTANT TOWN OF MY STATE WISHED TO ESTABLISH A BANK
AND IT PINCHES WHEN A BODY'S GOT A BILL WAITING A WASTE OF TIME TO PURIFY THE FOUNTAIN OF PUBLIC LAW
WAS THAT WHERE YOU LEARNED TO PLAY THE BONES
IT WILL REQUIRE A PORTION OF THE APPROPRIATION FOR NECESSARY EXPENSES AND I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT THERE ARE MEMBERS WHO WILL HAVE TO BE SEEN
THOUGH--I NEVER COULD SEE ANY MEANING TO IT
PHILIP WAS A NEW ENGLAND BOY AND HAD GRADUATED AT YALE
HE THOUGHT IT MUST BE MUCH EASIER TO LIVE BY AN INTERNAL LIGHT THAN BY A LOT OF OUTWARD RULES
QUIET RESIGNATION UNDER RELINQUISHMENT OF ANY THING HE WANTED WAS NOT IN HIS LINE
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOURSELF AND STRAIGHTWAY A WAVE OF THE CROWD SWEPT HER BEYOND HIS REACH
RUTH SANG FOR HARRY AND THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN TURNED THE LEAVES FOR HER AT THE PIANO AND PUT IN A BASS NOTE NOW AND THEN WHERE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD TELL
WHEN SHE'S RUN AND GONE AND FLED AND DEAD THEN WILL I FETCH HER AGAIN WITH AQUA VITA OUT OF AN OLD HOGSHEAD
AND THEN THE DOCTOR SAID FRANCOIS WAS OUT OF DANGER AND IF EVER THERE WAS A THANKFUL SET IN THIS WORLD IT WAS US LAURA'S RESPECT FOR THESE WOMEN HAD AUGMENTED DURING THIS CONVERSATION NATURALLY ENOUGH
AFTER HE LEFT COLLEGE PHILIP TOOK THE ADVICE OF FRIENDS AND READ LAW
WHAT IS THAT INQUIRED THE COLONEL ALWAYS READY TO INTEREST HIMSELF IN ANYTHING LARGE
THEN THERE WAS A HIATUS
BUT THEY ALSO GREW UP WITH THE IDEA THAT PIRATES WENT INTO ACTION IN THEIR SUNDAY CLOTHES CARRYING THE BLACK FLAG IN ONE HAND AND PISTOLLING PEOPLE WITH THE OTHER MERELY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO REPRESENTED IN THE PICTURES--BUT THESE ILLUSIONS VANISHED WHEN LATER YEARS BROUGHT THEIR DISENCHANTING WISDOM
AND I MADE THE BEST OF A BAD BARGAIN AND LET HER
THEY JUST SAY CHARGE NOT PROVEN IT LEAVES THE ACCUSED IN A KIND OF A SHAKY CONDITION BEFORE THE COUNTRY IT PURIFIES CONGRESS IT SATISFIES EVERYBODY AND IT DOESN'T SERIOUSLY HURT ANYBODY
AND I WILL FIND A WAY TO HELP MYSELF ALONG AND DO WHAT I CAN TO HELP THE REST TOO SHE SPOKE IT LIKE A PRINCESS
NOW TROLLOP OUGHT TO BE ON OUR SIDE FOR HE IS A FRIEND OF THE NEGRO
HER ENGAGEMENT WAS OF COURSE KNOWN IN HAWKEYE AND WAS INDEED A MATTER OF PRIDE TO HER FAMILY
AT THE END OF TWO OR THREE HOURS THE SENATOR ARRIVED IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY AND DINNER WAS WAITING
PHILIP'S FIRST EFFORT WAS TO GET HARRY OUT OF THE TOMBS
I PUT HIM INTO THAT SUGAR SPECULATION--WHAT A GRAND THING THAT WAS IF WE HADN'T HELD ON TOO LONG TRUE ENOUGH
IT MAY BE FOR WHEN THE GIRLS CAME DOWN STAIRS READY TO WALK TO THE CARS
IT'S ALL GREEK TO YOU OF COURSE BUT TO A MAN WHO IS ACQUAINTED WITH THOSE THINGS IT'S MERE--I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU SOMETIME
I CAN PLAY HIM AT MY LEISURE AND LAND HIM WHEN I CHOOSE
FOR HIS PART EVEN ALLOWING THE SENATOR TO BE GUILTY HE DID NOT THINK HIS CONTINUED PRESENCE DURING THE FEW REMAINING DAYS OF THE SESSION WOULD CONTAMINATE THE SENATE TO A DREADFUL DEGREE
FROM SOME OF THE PROMINENT NAMES IN THE LAND
ABOVE THE TOWN THE STREAM WAS CROSSED BY A CRAZY WOODEN BRIDGE THE SUPPORTS OF WHICH LEANED ALL WAYS IN THE SOGGY SOIL
THE MORAL OF WHICH IS THAT WHEN ONE LOANS MONEY TO START A BANK WITH ONE OUGHT TO TAKE THE PARTY'S WRITTEN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE FACT CHAPTER LX
WHEREUPON HE GAVE ME TWO PACKAGES OF BILLS SAID TO CONTAIN $2,000 AND $5,000 RESPECTIVELY
AND ONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST STARTLING THINGS YOU FIND OUT IS THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL YOU ENCOUNTER IN THE CITY OF WASHINGTON ALMOST--AND CERTAINLY EVERY SEPARATE AND DISTINCT INDIVIDUAL IN THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT FROM THE HIGHEST BUREAU CHIEF CLEAR DOWN TO THE MAID WHO SCRUBS DEPARTMENT HALLS THE NIGHT WATCHMEN OF THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND THE DARKEY BOY WHO PURIFIES THE DEPARTMENT SPITTOONS--REPRESENTS POLITICAL INFLUENCE
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS STILL.--THERE IS SCARCELY A BITE IN THE HOUSE TO EAT WHY NANCY GO TO JOHNSON JOHNSON INDEED
SHE HAD FINE CLEAN-CUT FEATURES HER COMPLEXION WAS PURE WHITE AND CONTRASTED VIVIDLY WITH HER BLACK HAIR AND EYES
ILIUM ITSELF SEEN AT A GLANCE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BE DILAPIDATED AND IF IT HAD GAINED ANYTHING BY BEING MADE A WOOD AND WATER STATION OF THE NEW RAILROAD IT WAS ONLY A NEW SORT OF GRIME AND RAWNESS
I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T BE SEEN WITH HIM IF YOU KNEW HIS REPUTATION DO YOU KNOW HIM LAURA ASKED AS INDIFFERENTLY AS SHE COULD
BUT A NEIGHBOR STIRRED UP THE COLONEL NOW THAT THE HOUSE HAD ITS EYE UPON HIM AND THE GREAT SPECULATOR FURLED HIS TENT LIKE THE ARAB
AS THE JUDGE FINISHED HIS CHARGE THE SPECTATORS ANXIOUSLY WATCHED THE FACES OF THE JURY
RAISE WOOL UPON EGG-SHELLS SIR AND MAKE GRASS GROW OUT OF MARROW-BONES TO MAKE HER COME
IT WAS SUCH A PLACE FOR THE PRACTICE OF AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTS THAT ANY STUDENT WHO HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL THERE WOULD HAVE AN EASY TASK IN ANY OTHER PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
GIVE IT ME NOW THERE IS NO HURRY
STANDING GUARD IN WASHINGTON OR ANYWHERE ELSE IS NOT AN EXCITING BUSINESS IN TIME OF PEACE BUT STANDING GUARD WAS ALL THAT THE TWO FRIENDS HAD TO DO
HE WAS NEVER PERMITTED TO ACHIEVE THE DIGNITY OF A SERIOUS FLIRTATION WITH HER IN PUBLIC
BUT I THINK I KNOW YOUR SEX
A PLACE WHERE TENDER YOUNG HUMANITY DEVOTED ITSELF FOR EIGHT OR TEN HOURS A DAY TO LEARNING INCOMPREHENSIBLE RUBBISH BY HEART OUT OF BOOKS AND RECITING IT BY ROTE LIKE PARROTS
TELL HIM TO CALL ALL HANDS AND GET A LOT OF THAT SUGAR FORRARD--PUT HER TEN INCHES BY THE HEAD
AND THERE IN KENTUCKY WHEN HE RAKED UP THAT OLD NUMSKULL THAT HAD BEEN INVENTING AWAY AT A PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE FOR TWENTY-TWO YEARS AND BERIAH SELLERS SAW AT A GLANCE WHERE JUST ONE MORE LITTLE COG-WHEEL WOULD SETTLE THE BUSINESS WHY I COULD SEE IT AS PLAIN AS DAY WHEN HE CAME IN WILD AT MIDNIGHT AND HAMMERED US OUT OF BED AND TOLD THE WHOLE THING IN A WHISPER WITH THE DOORS BOLTED AND THE CANDLE IN AN EMPTY BARREL
THE MAN WHO HAD SEEN THE ACTUAL WASHINGTON MONUMENT--PERHAPS TOUCHED IT WITH HIS HANDS
THE COLONEL'S WIFE HAD GONE INSANE THEY SAID
YOU'S BOUN TO FIND IT DIRECTED AUNTIE IF YOU DON'T KEAH NUFFIN BOUT DE ROAD AND GO FO DE SUN-DOWN A BRISK GALLOP BROUGHT THE RIDERS IN SIGHT OF THE TWINKLING LIGHT OF THE CAMP JUST AS THE STARS CAME OUT
ALICE WAS MAKING A WINTER VISIT
HOW DIFFERENTLY ALICE TREATED HIM
TELEGRAM AFTER TELEGRAM CAME
I THINK RUTH COMES HONESTLY BY CERTAIN TENDENCIES WHICH THEE HAS HIDDEN UNDER THE FRIEND'S DRESS MARGARET COULD NOT SAY NO TO THIS AND WHILE SHE PAUSED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MEMORY WAS BUSY WITH SUGGESTIONS TO SHAKE HER PRESENT OPINIONS
THE COLONEL'S MEMORY WAS A LITTLE AT FAULT HERE
FNOBJECTIONBILLTAKUZHLCOIXRSSOREFERRED HABITUES OF THE HOUSE COMPREHENDED THAT THIS LONG LIGHTNING-HEELED WORD SIGNIFIED THAT IF THERE WAS NO OBJECTION THE BILL WOULD TAKE THE CUSTOMARY COURSE OF A MEASURE OF ITS NATURE AND BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON BENEVOLENT APPROPRIATIONS AND THAT IT WAS ACCORDINGLY SO REFERRED
WELL I DON'T KNOW--I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT--BUT ANYWAY THEY CAN'T MAKE TRUNKS AND SADDLE-BAGS LIKE THAT IF THEY ARE--NO MAN CAN SAID THE COLONEL WITH HONEST SIMPLICITY
ALL THAT WAS NEEDED OF THEM WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ON HAND AND READY FOR ANY EMERGENCY THAT MIGHT COME UP
TO BE BEARERS OF THE BANNER AND SOLDIERS OF THE CROSS IN THE RUDE CAMPAIGNS OF LIFE AND RAPTURED SOULS IN THE HAPPY FIELDS OF PARADISE HEREAFTER
TO MR BOLTON HE WROTE A SHORT BUSINESS LETTER AS CALM AS HE COULD MAKE IT
ADMITTED THAT HE NEVER HAD HEARD BURGLARS IN THE HOUSE
THERE IS NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHOSE REPRESENTATIVES TRY EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS OURS DO OR STICK TO IT AS LONG ON A STRETCH
IT MAY NOT BE STRICTLY HONEST INDEED IT IS NOT UNLESS HE HAD SOME PUBLIC DOCUMENTS MIXED IN WITH THE CLOTHES IT'S A FUNNY WORLD
WE'VE BROUGHT SOME OF YOUR CLOTHES AT THE HOTEL
WE SHAN'T HAVE TO PAY THEM A CENT
IT WAS BALMY AND TRANQUIL THE VAGRANT BREEZES WERE LADEN WITH THE ODOR OF FLOWERS THE MURMUR OF BEES WAS IN THE AIR THERE WAS EVERYWHERE THAT SUGGESTION OF REPOSE THAT SUMMER WOODLANDS BRING TO THE SENSES AND THE VAGUE PLEASURABLE MELANCHOLY THAT SUCH A TIME AND SUCH SURROUNDINGS INSPIRE
AND TO MRS STERLING A WIDOW LIVING ON A SMALL INCOME IN A REMOTE MASSACHUSETTS VILLAGE PHILADELPHIA WAS A CITY OF MANY SPLENDORS
I DESIRE THY HAPPINESS FIRST OF ALL BUT THEE IS STARTING OUT ON A DANGEROUS PATH
YOU'D LEARN BETTER THAN THAT
HAWKINS SAID TO HIMSELF HOW CAN A MAN EVER LOSE FAITH
MR TROLLOP HAS ALL ALONG BEEN THE BRAVEST AND MOST EFFICIENT CHAMPION OF VIRTUE AND THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE BILL AND THE REPORT IS WITHOUT DOUBT A SHAMELESS INVENTION NEXT DAY
HE ADDED WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY AND LONG PAUSES THESE WORDS
BUT IT'S SO
BUT NOW THE FIRE FADED OUT OF HIS EYES AND HE FELL BACK EXHAUSTED
SELLERS THAT HE'D BETTER BE ON THE MOVE FOR THE LINE WAS CERTAIN TO GO TO STONE'S LANDING
AN INTEREST HOWEVER WHICH DID NOT EXACTLY SATISFY PHILIP--IT WAS TOO GENERAL AND NOT PERSONAL ENOUGH TO SUIT HIM
ALL RIGHT MY BOY ALL RIGHT--ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE YOU--ALWAYS GLAD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE AND TAKE YOU BY THE HAND
DO YOU THINK I AM IN LOVE WITH HER BLESS YOU NO
HE FELL AT LENGTH INTO A RESTLESS DOZE
MRS HAWKINS WAS PROSTRATED BY THIS LAST BLOW AND IT WAS WELL THAT CLAY WAS AT HER SIDE TO STAY HER WITH COMFORTING WORDS AND TAKE UPON HIMSELF THE ORDERING OF THE HOUSEHOLD WITH ITS BURDEN OF LABORS AND CARES
AND HE COULD HAVE SAVED ME BY HIS SINGLE VOICE
BUT FINALLY SHE WOULD GROW CALMER AND SAY SOME COMFORTING DISDAINFUL THING--SOMETHING LIKE THIS
THIS SEEMS LIKE A PROVIDENTIAL CALL
AN OPENING EH THE COLONEL'S EYES TWINKLED
HE ALWAYS ADDRESSED HIS PARENT AS BROTHER PLUM AND BORE HIMSELF ALTOGETHER IN SUCH A SUPERIOR MANNER THAT RUTH LONGED TO PUT BENT PINS IN HIS CHAIR
SELLERS THAT NIGHT
HE SAID THERE WAS A FORTUNE IN IT FOR A SMART YOUNG FELLOW BUT I PREFERRED TO TAKE THE CHANCES OUT HERE
THERE'S ONE INGREDIENT WANTED YET TO PERFECT THE THING AND SOMEHOW I CAN'T JUST MANAGE TO HIT UPON THE THING THAT'S NECESSARY AND I DON'T DARE TALK WITH A CHEMIST OF COURSE
THAT'S ALL OH I HAVEN'T GOT MUCH IN READY MONEY I CAN LAY MY HANDS ON NOW BUT IF A FELLOW COULD DO ANYTHING WITH FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AS A BEGINNING I SHALL DRAW FOR THAT WHEN I SEE THE RIGHT OPENING WELL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S SOMETHING FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SAY TWENTY--AS AN ADVANCE SAID THE COLONEL REFLECTIVELY AS IF TURNING OVER HIS MIND FOR A PROJECT THAT COULD BE ENTERED ON WITH SUCH A TRIFLING SUM
THE SMOKE OF OTHER LOCOMOTIVES WAS SEEN ON PARALLEL LINES
HIS PAPER SUPPORTED THE NEW BILL WITH GUSHING AFFECTION
IT IS ANNOYING TO HAVE TO WAIT A WEEK FOR THEM TO WARM UP
THEN THE SUPERINTENDENT PUT IN HIS OAR
WHEN MY HUSBAND CAME HOME AND LOOKED OVER THE CARDS HE SAID HE HAD A COTTON CLAIM
I TAKE BACK EVERYTHING I SAID ON THAT HEAD
HER STEADY EYES SEEMED TO DEVOUR HIM
AND NATURALLY ENOUGH MRS HAWKINS APPEARED ON THE STAGE AT THAT MOMENT
BUT RUTH DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE HAPPIER OR DO MORE GOOD IN FOLLOWING YOUR PROFESSION THAN IN HAVING A HOME OF YOUR OWN WHAT IS TO HINDER HAVING A HOME OF MY OWN NOTHING PERHAPS ONLY YOU NEVER WOULD BE IN IT--YOU WOULD BE AWAY DAY AND NIGHT IF YOU HAD ANY PRACTICE
A SHORT ANSWER CAME TO THIS SIMPLY SAYING THAT MONEY WAS VERY TIGHT IN WALL STREET JUST THEN AND THAT HE HAD BETTER JOIN THE ENGINEER CORPS AS SOON AS HE COULD
BUT THIS OTHER ONE--THE ONE I READ LAST--HAS THE TRUE RING
HE UNBLUSHINGLY DENIED IT
NONE--ALWAYS NONE HE WOULD BRING OUT A PIECE OF ROCK AND EXAMINE IT AND SAY TO HIMSELF IT IS LIMESTONE--IT HAS CRINOIDS AND CORALS IN IT--THE ROCK IS RIGHT THEN HE WOULD THROW IT DOWN WITH A SIGH AND SAY BUT THAT IS NOTHING
CLAY AND WASHINGTON WERE THE SAME LOVING AND ADMIRING BROTHERS NOW THAT THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN
AND THE SHARPERS OR FOOLS I DON'T KNOW WHICH HAVE CONTRIVED TO INVOLVE ME FOR THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS THE FIRST OBLIGATION
PERHAPS IN HER MIND SHE COMPARED HIM WITH HARRY AND RECOGNIZED IN HIM A MAN TO WHOM A WOMAN MIGHT GIVE HER WHOLE SOUL RECKLESSLY AND WITH LITTLE CARE IF SHE LOST IT
AS FAST AS ONE OF THEM PUT DOWN THE SPY-GLASS ANOTHER TOOK IT UP--BUT ALWAYS WITH A STUDIED AIR OF CALMNESS
PHILIP CALLED ALICE HIS GOOD SISTER AND TALKED TO HER ABOUT LOVE AND MARRIAGE MEANING RUTH AS IF SISTERS COULD BY NO POSSIBILITY HAVE ANY PERSONAL CONCERN IN SUCH THINGS
HE WAS JUST AS LIBERAL WITH WHAT HE HAD AS BEFORE INDEED IT WAS HIS NATURE TO BE FREE WITH HIS MONEY OR WITH THAT OF OTHERS AND HE COULD LEND OR SPEND A DOLLAR WITH AN AIR THAT MADE IT SEEM LIKE TEN
THE COLONEL AND HARRY RETIRED TO CONSULT
HAWKINS FITTED OUT HIS HOUSE WITH STORE FURNITURE FROM ST LOUIS AND THE FAME OF ITS MAGNIFICENCE WENT ABROAD IN THE LAND
YOU TOOK THAT MAN'S PART WHEN HE HADN'T A FRIEND IN THE WORLD AND YOU BUILT HIM UP AND MADE HIM RICH
HE WOULD REMAIN AT HIS POST TILL HE PERISHED IF NEED BE
BUT THEY SUDDENLY RECOLLECTED THEMSELVES NOW AND TOOK THEIR DEPARTURE
SELLERS AND WASHINGTON RETURN HOME AFTER THE VOTE 195.  A COURT-IN SCENE 196.  POPULAR ENDORSEMENT 197.  ONE OF THE INSULTED MEMBERS 195.  TOUCHED BY THE SIRUGGLES OF THE POOR 199.  MR NOBLE ASKS QUESTIONS 200.  THE WORN OUT STYLE OF SENATOR 201.  THE PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE 202.  THE LAST LINK BROKEN 203.  THE TERRIBLE ORDEAL 204.  RETROSPECTION 205.  GOOD-BYE TO WASHINGTON 206.  TAIL PIECE 207.  THE PARTING BLAST OFFERED 208.  THE LAST BLAST 209.  STRUCK IT AT LAST 210.  THE RICH PROPRIETOR 211.  THE SICK CHAMBER 212.  ALICE CHAPTER LV
HE APPEARED IN CHURCH
I WON'T STAY IN THIS DEAD COUNTRY AND DECAY WITH IT
MANY SPEECHES WERE MADE
THEY HAD NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AT HIS PLACE UP IN THE COUNTRY YET BUT THE COLONEL OFTEN DINED WITH THEM AND IN CONFIDENCE CONFIDED TO THEM HIS PROJECTS AND SEEMED TO TAKE A GREAT LIKING TO THEM ESPECIALLY TO HIS FRIEND HARRY
IT PROVIDED ALSO FOR THE PURCHASE OF SIXTY-FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND FULLY DESCRIBED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE UNIVERSITY IN THE KNOBS OF EAST TENNESSEE
AND IT'S FILLING UP EVERY DAY--PEOPLE COMING FROM EVERYWHERE
THE TEN THE VOICE DIED OUT IN A WHISPER
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN HOW SWEET SHE WAS ON ME
AND MOREOVER HE WILL WORK FOR IT TOO BEFORE I AM DONE WITH HIM
THE RESULT OF THIS LITTLE ADVENTURE WAS THAT PHILIP DID NOT REACH ILIUM TILL DAYLIGHT THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE DESCENDED SLEEPY AND SORE FROM A WAY TRAIN AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM
SHE OBSERVED WITH SURPRISE THAT FAMOUS STATESMEN AND SOLDIERS DID NOT TALK LIKE GODS AS A GENERAL THING BUT SAID RATHER COMMONPLACE THINGS FOR THE MOST PART
LET SOCIETY FINISH THE TRAGEDY IF IT LIKED
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IN THE WORLD TO DO
I DOUBT IF A CHRISTIAN WOULD BE JUSTIFIED IN WORKING FOR HIS OWN SALVATION IF IT WAS NOT TO AID IN THE SALVATION OF HIS FELLOW MEN THE SENATOR SPOKE WITH FEELING AND THEN ADDED I HOPE YOU SHOWED HOPPERSON THAT OUR MOTIVES WERE PURE YES AND HE SEEMED TO HAVE A NEW LIGHT ON THE MEASURE
BE IT GOOD OR BAD LET IT FIND US READY TO MAKE THE NEXT MOVE INSTANTLY WHATEVER IT MAY BE THAT'S THE RIGHT TALK SAID SELLERS
THERE WAS A CASUAL REFERENCE TO THIS HANDSOME-FEATURED ARISTOCRATIC GENTLEMAN AS IF THE READER AND THE WRITER WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SPEAK OF HIM AND KNEW WHO WAS MEANT
AND THE MORE THE CLOCK BUCKLED DOWN TO HER WORK AS THE COLONEL EXPRESSED IT AND THE MORE INSUPPORTABLE THE CLATTER BECAME THE MORE ENCHANTED THEY ALL APPEARED TO BE
I WONDER IF MR BOLTON WOULD RATHER SELL OUT OR WORK IT OH WORK IT SAYS HARRY PROBABLY THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN IS COAL NOW YOU'VE GOT TO IT POSSIBLY IT MIGHT NOT BE MUCH OF A VEIN AFTER ALL SUGGESTED PHILIP
REMEMBERING MY YOUNG FRIEND I SAID I WOULD LIKE A FEW THOUSANDS NOW AND A FEW MORE BY AND BY
AGAIN I THOUGHT IS THIS A THEATRE
NOW SHE LIFTED HER HEAD AND NOTED WITH SURPRISE HOW THE DAY HAD WASTED
THE MAN IS DEAD THAT MADE THAT TRUNK AND THAT SADDLE-BAGS ARE HIS GREAT-GRAND-CHILDREN STILL LIVING SAID WASHINGTON WITH LEVITY ONLY IN THE WORDS NOT IN THE TONE
HE A COMMITTEE MAN JUMPED UP AND SAID
B THOSE ARE MY PRIVATE MARKS
SHE PLAYED WITH HIM SO ADROITLY THAT HARRY THOUGHT SHE WAS ABSORBED IN LOVE FOR HIM AND YET HE WAS AMAZED THAT HE DID NOT GET ON FASTER IN HIS CONQUEST
BUT FOOL AS I AM I TOLD HIM HE COULD HAVE HALF THE IRON PROPERTY FOR THIRTY THOUSAND--AND IF I ONLY HAD HIM BACK HERE HE COULDN'T TOUCH IT FOR A CENT LESS THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION MRS HAWKINS LOOKED UP WHITE AND DESPAIRING
IT WAS A POVERTY STRICKEN PLACE
IF MRS A.'S DAUGHTER MARRIES OR A CHILD IS BORN TO THE FAMILY MRS B
PHILIP LEARNED AFTERWARDS THAT TEMPERANCE AND THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF SUNDAY AND A CERTAIN GRAVITY OF DEPORTMENT ARE GEOGRAPHICAL HABITS WHICH PEOPLE DO NOT USUALLY CARRY WITH THEM AWAY FROM HOME
BUT I CLAIM NO CREDIT FOR THAT--IF I STIFFENED UP HIS BACK-BONE A LITTLE I SIMPLY PUT HIM IN THE WAY TO MAKE HIS FIGHT--DIDN'T UNDERTAKE IT MYSELF
IN THE SAD LIGHT OF THE DEPARTING DAY THE PLACE LOOKED HOMELESS ENOUGH
OH LET US COME OUT AND BE FRANK WITH EACH OTHER
NEVER A WORD IN ALL THESE YEARS
I TELL YOU IT HAS ITS EFFECT OH BOTHER THE EFFECT!--WHAT IS IT THEY DO DO
REMARKABLE CLOCK SAID SELLERS AND GOT UP AND WOUND IT
SO ONE OF MY GIRLS IS GOING TO TURN OUT AND WORK FOR HER LIVING
FIRST YOU GLIMPSE THE ORNAMENTAL UPPER WORKS OF A LONG SNOWY PALACE PROJECTING ABOVE A GROVE OF TREES AND A TALL GRACEFUL WHITE DOME WITH A STATUE ON IT SURMOUNTING THE PALACE AND PLEASANTLY CONTRASTING WITH THE BACKGROUND OF BLUE SKY
PRIVATE INTERESTS MUST GIVE WAY TO THE PUBLIC GOOD
BUT WE ARE SUCH OLD FRIENDS MR BRIERLY THAT I DIDN'T SUPPOSE YOU WOULD BE JEALOUS I THINK I MUST BE A VERY OLD FRIEND THEN BY YOUR CONDUCT TOWARDS ME
SELBY'S HIS NAME WAS A COLONEL
BUT THE ENTIRE CONTRACT COULD BE ASSIGNED TO HIM--THE SECURITY WAS AMPLE--IT WAS A FORTUNE TO HIM IF IT WAS FORFEITED
AND FINALLY IF THE NATURE OF THE BILL WERE NOT KNOWN AT ALL THE LOVE FEAST WOULD SUPPORT IT ANYWAY AND UNHESITATINGLY FOR THE FACT THAT SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS THE ORIGINATOR OF THE MEASURE WAS A GUARANTY THAT IT CONTEMPLATED A WORTHY AND RIGHTEOUS WORK
AND NOW THE NEW MOTHER CAME AGAIN AND HELPED HIM TO DRESS AND COMBED HIS HAIR AND DREW HIS MIND AWAY BY DEGREES FROM THE DISMAL YESTERDAY BY TELLING HIM ABOUT THE WONDERFUL JOURNEY HE WAS GOING TO TAKE AND THE STRANGE THINGS HE WAS GOING TO SEE
EVERYBODY WAS IN HASTE TOO TO PUSH ON HIS PRIVATE PLAN AND FEVERISH IN HIS HASTE AS IF IN CONSTANT APPREHENSION THAT TOMORROW WOULD BE JUDGMENT DAY
PERHAPS I OUGHTN'T SAID ANYTHING BUT ITS BOUND TO COME OUT SOONER OR LATER SO WHAT IS THE ODDS
THE HOUSE WILL COME TO ORDER
THOSE WHO HAD KNOWN HER SO WELL IN WASHINGTON MIGHT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT THE FASCINATING WOMAN COULD HAVE HAD MURDER IN HER HEART AND WOULD READILY GIVE EAR TO THE CURRENT SENTIMENTALITY ABOUT THE TEMPORARY ABERRATION OF MIND UNDER THE STRESS OF PERSONAL CALAMITY
JUDGE THOUGHT NOT
JEX AND FLUKE HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR INIQUITOUS ALLEGIANCE WITH SIX OR EIGHT OTHERS OF LESSER CALIBRE AND IT IS REPORTED AND BELIEVED THAT TUBBS AND HUFFY ARE READY TO GO BACK
WHY BLESS YOU LET THE APPROPRIATION LAG IF IT WANTS TO--THAT'S NO GREAT MATTER--THERE'S A BIGGER THING THAN THAT BIGGER THAN $200,000 BERIAH BIGGER CHILD?--WHY WHAT'S $200,000
FOR WEEKS AS I SHALL SHOW YOU BY THE TESTIMONY OF HER ADOPTED MOTHER AND BROTHER SHE HOVERED OVER DEATH IN DELIRIUM
YOU ARRIVE IN TOLERABLY GOOD SPIRITS BECAUSE IT IS ONLY THIRTY-EIGHT MILES FROM BALTIMORE TO THE CAPITAL AND SO YOU HAVE ONLY BEEN INSULTED THREE TIMES PROVIDED YOU ARE NOT IN A SLEEPING CAR--THE AVERAGE IS HIGHER THERE
HARRY WAS THE GUEST OF SENATOR DILWORTHY
PHILIP SAT DOWN AMID THE RUINS AND ALMOST WISHED HE WERE BURIED IN THEM
AT LEAST YOU'RE GOING TO BE
THESE TWO GRANDEES WENT AT THEIR IMPOSING IMPROVEMENT WITH THE AIR OF MEN WHO HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH THE WORK OF ALTERING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE GLOBE
GOT A WIFE AND FAMILY
THERE WAS THE SUSQUEHANNAH GLEAMING IN THE MOON-LIGHT
ALL THE TOWN WAS ASSEMBLED AT THE STAGE OFFICE WHEN HE ARRIVED TWO BONFIRES WERE BURNING AND A BATTERY OF ANVILS WAS POPPING EXULTANT BROADSIDES
AND OTHERS SAY IT IS NONSENSE TO SUPPOSE YOU WOULD ENTANGLE YOURSELF WITH A MARRIED MAN AND THAT YOUR INTIMACY ONLY ARISES FROM THE MATTER OF THE COTTON CLAIMS FOR WHICH HE WANTS YOUR INFLUENCE WITH DILWORTHY
YOU'LL BE RIGHT HERE WHERE I CAN PUT MY HAND ON YOU WHEN ANYTHING TURNS UP
BUT THE BEST ARISTOCRACY OF THE THREE WASHINGTON CASTES AND REALLY THE MOST POWERFUL BY FAR WAS THAT OF THE MIDDLE GROUND
PERHAPS SHE FORGETS IN TIME THAT SHE IS NOT THEIR CHILD
IT IS UGLY ENOUGH OUTSIDE BUT THAT IS NOTHING TO WHAT IT IS INSIDE
HARRY WOULD TAKE OFF HIS COAT REMOVE HIS CRAVAT ROLL UP HIS SHIRT-SLEEVES GIVE HIS CURLY HAIR THE RIGHT TOUCH BEFORE THE GLASS GET OUT HIS BOOK ON ENGINEERING HIS BOXES OF INSTRUMENTS HIS DRAWING PAPER HIS PROFILE PAPER OPEN THE BOOK OF LOGARITHMS MIX HIS INDIA INK SHARPEN HIS PENCILS LIGHT A CIGAR AND SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE TO LAY OUT A LINE WITH THE MOST GRAVE NOTION THAT HE WAS MASTERING THE DETAILS OF ENGINEERING
SELBY AND THE EFFECT UPON HER CHAPTER XXXIX COL
MILLIONS
PERHAPS JUST AS A PLEASANTRY YOU WILL SAY YES
WASHINGTON LISTENED WITH BATED BREATH TO THE AYE NO NO AYE OF THE VOTERS FOR A FEW DREAD MINUTES AND THEN COULD BEAR THE SUSPENSE NO LONGER
OH THEY SAY A GOOD MANY THINGS
SILAS HAWKINS OF MISSOURI IN REFERENCE TO A LEASE OF A PORTION OF THEIR VALUABLE PROPERTY IN EAST TENNESSEE
HE WORE A DIAMOND CLUSTER-PIN AND HE PARTED HIS HAIR BEHIND
CHAPTER XXXV
HE MOVED THE REFERENCE OF THE PETITION TO THE PROPER COMMITTEE
TRIM COLORED SERVANTS DAINTY FOOD--EVERYTHING A BODY COULD WISH FOR
IT'S IMMENSE I CAN TELL YOU
THEN CAME LETTERS TELLING OF MR DILWORTHY'S STRUGGLES WITH A STUBBORN MAJORITY IN HIS OWN COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE
THAT IS ONLY A DROP
WHAT'S A STIRRIN DOWN BOUT THE FORKS CONTINUED OLD DAMRELL
HOW FATHER'S WISDOM IS PROVEN AT LAST
A BOY ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD WAS SITTING IN THE CABIN DOOR WITH HIS FACE BOWED IN HIS HANDS
HE WENT SO FAR AS TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT WOULD BE WORTH HIS WHILE TO TAKE THE PROFESSORSHIP OF CIVIL ENGINEERING IN THE NEW INSTITUTION
AND ALMOST WITH ANIMATION
YOU ARE NOT LIKE HIM
MR BIGLER'S PLAN THIS TIME ABOUT WHICH HE TALKED LOUDLY WITH HIS MOUTH FULL ALL DINNER TIME WAS THE BUILDING OF THE TUNKHANNOCK RATTLESNAKE AND YOUNGWOMANS TOWN RAILROAD WHICH WOULD NOT ONLY BE A GREAT HIGHWAY TO THE WEST BUT WOULD OPEN TO MARKET INEXHAUSTIBLE COAL-FIELDS AND UNTOLD MILLIONS OF LUMBER
HE'S ONE OF THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC ENGINEERS IN THIS WESTERN COUNTRY AND ONE OF THE BEST FELLOWS THAT EVER LOOKED THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF A GLASS THE RECOMMENDATION WAS NOT UNDESERVED
WELL HOW TO DO IT WAS THE NEXT THING
IN THE WORDS OF A NEWSPAPER OF THE DAY THEY LAVISHED HIM WITH KISSES IT WAS SOMETHING SWEET TO DO
I AM SURPRISED AT IT EVEN AFTER THE EXTRAORDINARY SPEECH OF MY LEARNED FRIEND HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO CONNECT IT MR BRAHAM ASKED THE JUDGE
YOU CANNOT BE IGNORANT OF WHAT ALL THE CITY IS TALKING OF PHILIP SAID THIS DETERMINEDLY AND WITH SOME BITTERNESS
A LAND OPERATOR ENGAGED IN VAST SPECULATIONS A FAVORITE IN THE SELECT CIRCLES OF NEW YORK IN CORRESPONDENCE WITH BROKERS AND BANKERS INTIMATE WITH PUBLIC MEN AT WASHINGTON ONE WHO COULD PLAY THE GUITAR AND TOUCH THE BANJO LIGHTLY AND WHO HAD AN EYE FOR A PRETTY GIRL AND KNEW THE LANGUAGE OF FLATTERY WAS WELCOME EVERYWHERE IN HAWKEYE
PHILIP PAID THEM SWOLLEN AS THEY WERE WITH A MONSTROUS LIST OF EXTRAS
DON'T YOU FAIL TO WRITE YOUR FATHER ABOUT IT WASHINGTON
HE MIGHT FIND SOMETHING FOR YOU TO DO MAYBE BUT YOU'D BETTER TRY TO GET TO HIM YOURSELF WASHINGTON--IT'S ONLY THIRTY MILES BUT HOW CAN I FATHER
YOU MAY TRUST ME--INDEED YOU MAY THE DOOR-BELL RANG
HE WILL RECOVER PRESENTLY THE DOCTORS SAY
WHEREUPON MR SLUM GENTLY RAISED THE YOUTH CARRIED HIM FORTH AND SET HIM DOWN JUST OUTSIDE THE CAR TO COOL OFF
THEN THE CLERK TREMBLING AT HIS OWN AUDACITY BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO ASSIST
CHAPTER LXI
AND HE SAID HE FELT HE COULDN'T VOTE FOR IT
THERE WAS A CHURCH A GRAVEYARD A MILL A VILLAGE
PERHAPS WHEN THEE HAS SEEN MORE THEE WILL BETTER APPRECIATE A QUIET LIFE THEE MARRIED YOUNG
BUT NO MATTER--I CAN WAIT
SHE CAN WAKE THE DEAD
PHILIP HAD INSISTED ON RE-CONVEYING THE ILIUM PROPERTY TO MR BOLTON RETAINING ONLY THE SHARE ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED FOR HIMSELF AND MR BOLTON THEREFORE ONCE MORE FOUND HIMSELF ENGAGED IN BUSINESS AND A PERSON OF SOME CONSEQUENCE IN THIRD STREET
SUCH WAS THE SERENITY OF THE BOLTON HOUSEHOLD THAT A STRANGER IN IT WOULD NEVER HAVE SUSPECTED THERE WAS ANY OPPOSITION TO RUTH'S GOING TO THE MEDICAL SCHOOL
WOULD HE SMILE AS IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN SHE LOVED HIM SO
YOU KNOW MY UNCLE IS A GREAT RAILROAD MAN
AND GIVE HIS VALUABLE SERVICES IN THE MINING OPERATIONS AT ILIUM
BY AND BY THE DARKNESS SWALLOWED IT UP AND LATER THE GRAY DAWN REVEALED IT AGAIN
HE TOOK A GREAT INTEREST IN HURRICANES
DOES A BODY'S WHOLE SOUL GOOD TO LOOK AT YOU
HE WAS TOO BUSY CURSING HIMSELF INWARDLY FOR BEING AN EGOTISTICAL IMBECILE
NOBLE DECLINED
HE COULD NOT CONCEIVE HOW IT HAD COME ABOUT IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM THAT THE GOSSIP ABOUT HIS FAMILY'S GREAT WEALTH HAD ANY THING TO DO WITH IT HE COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR IT BY ANY PROCESS OF REASONING AND WAS SIMPLY OBLIGED TO ACCEPT THE FACT AND GIVE UP TRYING TO SOLVE THE RIDDLE
YOUR HONOR WE PUT THESE LETTERS IN EVIDENCE THE LETTERS WERE A PORTION OF THE CORRESPONDENCE OF MAJOR LACKLAND WITH SILAS HAWKINS
PEOPLE CAME TWO OR THREE MILES TO LOOK AT IT
IT HAS A GOOD MORAL EFFECT WHO DOES IT HAVE A GOOD MORAL EFFECT ON WELL--I DON'T KNOW
I SEE NOW
THE FIRST THING HE SUGGESTED FOR PERCY WAS TO HAVE HIM TAKEN OUT IN THE BACK YARD FOR AN AIRING EVERY AFTERNOON WITH NOTHING AT ALL ON MRS O
THE FURTHER ONE WENT THE WIDER THE OPPORTUNITIES OPENED
PHILIP WAS NOT WEARY HOWEVER OF MAKING THESE ATTEMPTS HE RATHER ENJOYED IT
NOW WE CAN MARCH INTO CONGRESS WITH DRUMS BEATING AND COLORS FLYING WELL--WELL--WELL
SHE HAD UPON HIS MIND THAT PEACEFUL INFLUENCE THAT MRS BOLTON HAD WHEN OCCASIONALLY SHE SAT BY HIS BEDSIDE WITH HER WORK
BY YOUR REPORTS IT APPEARS THAT YOU HAVE EXPENDED THE SUM OF $9,610 UPON THE SAID WORK
IT WAS THE SORT OF NEWS HIS FRIENDS WERE QUITE WILLING TO LISTEN TO
RUTH WAS AS PALE AS THE WHITE SHEET AND HER COMRADE WHISPERED COME AWAY RUTH IT IS AWFUL PERHAPS IT WAS THE WAVERING LIGHT OF THE CANDLES PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY THE AGONY FROM A DEATH OF PAIN BUT THE REPULSIVE BLACK FACE SEEMED TO WEAR A SCOWL THAT SAID HAVEN'T YOU YET DONE WITH THE OUTCAST PERSECUTED BLACK MAN BUT YOU MUST NOW HAUL HIM FROM HIS GRAVE AND SEND EVEN YOUR WOMEN TO DISMEMBER HIS BODY WHO IS THIS DEAD MAN ONE OF THOUSANDS WHO DIED YESTERDAY AND WILL BE DUST ANON TO PROTEST THAT SCIENCE SHALL NOT TURN HIS WORTHLESS CARCASS TO SOME ACCOUNT
HERE IS ONE CALLS IT A QUESTIONABLE MEASURE BAH THERE IS NO STRENGTH IN THAT
HE OPENED IT READ IT CRUSHED IT IN HIS HAND AND THREW IT DOWN
HE LEFT THE STILE ENTERED THAT PART OF HIS HOUSE WHICH WAS THE STORE TRADED A QUART OF THICK MOLASSES FOR A COONSKIN AND A CAKE OF BEESWAX TO AN OLD DAME IN LINSEY-WOOLSEY PUT HIS LETTER AWAY AND WENT INTO THE KITCHEN
PROCEED MR BRAHAM COL
HE HAD THE AIR OF A MAN OF BUSINESS AND WAS EVIDENTLY A PERSON OF IMPORTANCE
WAS THERE ANY BUILDING IN GREECE TO COMPARE WITH GIRARD COLLEGE WAS THERE EVER SUCH A MAGNIFICENT PILE OF STONE DEVISED FOR THE SHELTER OF POOR ORPHANS
BUT ALL DAY HE AND HIS WIFE MADE INQUIRIES AND HOPED AGAINST HOPE
NOW AND THEN HER TEASING HUMOR CAME AGAIN
THEY WERE SEATED NOW SIDE BY SIDE TALKING WITH MORE CALMNESS
LORD HOW SHE WALKS UP ON US
HIS FIRST STEP WAS TO HIRE THREE WOODSMEN TO ACCOMPANY HIM
HAD RUTH A PREMONITION OF PHILIP'S INTENTION IN HIS MANNER
IT LOOKS SMALL LOOKS SMALL ON PAPER BUT IT'S GOT A BIG FUTURE
WELL SAID THE COLONEL I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU ARE MORE OR LESS RIGHT THERE
RUTH'S HOME BY THE INTERVENTION OF PHILIP WAS IN A FAMILY--ONE OF THE RARE EXCEPTIONS IN LIFE OR IN FICTION--THAT HAD NEVER KNOWN BETTER DAYS
THERE IS AN EXPLOSION ONE OF THOSE TERRIBLE CATASTROPHES WHICH LEAVE THE IMPRINT OF AN UNSETTLED MIND UPON THE SURVIVORS
MERE LIFE IS A LUXURY AND THE COLOR OF THE GRASS OF THE FLOWERS OF THE SKY THE WIND IN THE TREES THE OUTLINES OF THE HORIZON THE FORMS OF CLOUDS ALL GIVE A PLEASURE AS EXQUISITE AS THE SWEETEST MUSIC TO THE EAR FAMISHING FOR IT
ONE OF THE MEN IN THIRD STREET ASKED HIM THE OTHER DAY WHETHER HIS WAS A HIGH CHURCH OR A LOW CHURCH
BUT BALLOON IS NOT ALONE WE HAVE MANY TRULY NOBLE STATESMEN IN OUR COUNTRY'S SERVICE LIKE BALLOON
IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A DELIBERATE AND PREMEDITATED MURDER THE WOMAN FOLLOWING HIM TO WASHINGTON ON PURPOSE TO COMMIT IT
I MEAN THAT I HAVE HEARD THAT CONGRESSMEN HAVE SOMETIMES HIRED LITERARY GRUBS TO BUILD SPEECHES FOR THEM.--NOW DIDN'T I OVERHEAR A CONVERSATION LIKE THAT I SPOKE OF PSHAW
YOU WERE GIVEN YOUR INSTRUCTIONS AND PUT TO WORK
HE MET AND ENCOURAGED THE TEMPERANCE SOCIETIES
IF DEY WAS GALS WOULDN'T DEY BE DE SHE-BREW CHIL'EN
THEN RETURNED THE BILLS TO HIS WALLET WITH THE INDIFFERENT AIR OF A MAN WHO IS USED TO MONEY
BUT I SUPPOSE YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO IT SHE ADDED WITH A GENERAL IDEA THAT THE THERMOMETER ALWAYS STANDS AT 90 DEG
IT WILL GO TO ANY LENGTH TO VINDICATE ITS HONOR AT SUCH A TIME AH WELL WE HAVE TALKED THE MORNING THROUGH JUST AS USUAL IN THESE TIRESOME DAYS OF WAITING AND WE HAVE REACHED THE SAME OLD RESULT
HARRY WROTE FREQUENTLY TO SELLERS AND ALWAYS ENCOURAGINGLY
THE PATIENT WITH CLOSED EYES LAY SCARCELY BREATHING
PUT IT IN YOUR SPEECH
THE COLOR CAME FAINTLY TO HER CHEEKS AND SHE HESITATED
AND PATRIOTIC?--WHY THEY NAMED IT AFTER CONGRESS ITSELF
ONE BUNDLE WAS MARKED PRIVATE AND IN THAT SHE FOUND WHAT SHE WANTED
BUT LAURA RATHER PRIDED HERSELF UPON SOME OF HER EXPLOITS OF THAT CHARACTER
I HAVE HAD MY JOKE AND YOU'VE BORNE THE INFLICTION BECOMINGLY ENOUGH
HE RECOVERED HIMSELF REACHED THE BELL ROPE DAMN YOU I'LL LEARN YOU STEPPED TO THE DOOR AND CALLED A COUPLE OF BRAKEMEN AND THEN AS THE SPEED SLACKENED
YOU'VE A RESPECT FOR RELIGION TOO SAYS HE AND KNOW HOW THE CAUSE OF THE GOSPEL GOES WITH IMPROVEMENTS
I CAN WAIT PATIENTLY--EVER SO PATIENTLY
AND AS THEY FELL BACK THEY HEARD PRISONED VOICES SAYING
HIS LIFE LAY BEYOND THE THEATRE OF THIS TALE
MIST-ER.....ER BRIERLY
A ROAR AND A HURRAH WENT UP FROM THE CROWDED DECKS OF BOTH STEAMERS--ALL HANDS RUSHED TO THE GUARDS TO LOOK AND SHOUT AND GESTICULATE--THE WEIGHT CAREENED THE VESSELS OVER TOWARD EACH OTHER--OFFICERS FLEW HITHER AND THITHER CURSING AND STORMING TRYING TO DRIVE THE PEOPLE AMIDSHIPS--BOTH CAPTAINS WERE LEANING OVER THEIR RAILINGS SHAKING THEIR FISTS SWEARING AND THREATENING--BLACK VOLUMES OF SMOKE ROLLED UP AND CANOPIED THE SCENE,--DELIVERING A RAIN OF SPARKS UPON THE VESSELS--TWO PISTOL SHOTS RANG OUT AND BOTH CAPTAINS DODGED UNHURT AND THE PACKED MASSES OF PASSENGERS SURGED BACK AND FELL APART WHILE THE SHRIEKS OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN SOARED ABOVE THE INTOLERABLE DIN AND THEN THERE WAS A BOOMING ROAR A THUNDERING CRASH AND THE RIDDLED AMARANTH DROPPED LOOSE FROM HER HOLD AND DRIFTED HELPLESSLY AWAY
REST PERFECTLY EASY ONE AND ALL OF YOU FOR OUR TROUBLES ARE NEARLY AT AN END POOR LAD HE COULD NOT KNOW THAT HIS MOTHER WOULD CRY SOME LOVING COMPASSIONATE TEARS OVER HIS LETTER AND PUT OFF THE FAMILY WITH A SYNOPSIS OF ITS CONTENTS WHICH CONVEYED A DEAL OF LOVE TO THEM BUT NOT MUCH IDEA OF HIS PROSPECTS OR PROJECTS
LET US GO THE BAGGAGE WAGON HAD ARRIVED
YOU WILL FIND WE CAN SWING A TWO-THIRDS VOTE--I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED OF IT
OR TUPPER OR A DICTIONARY OR T
IF THE KNOBS UNIVERSITY BILL COULD ONLY GO THROUGH WHAT A CHANGE WOULD BE WROUGHT IN THE CONDITION OF MOST OF THE PERSONS IN THIS HISTORY
DE LAW SAKES CHILE DIDN'T I SEE HIM A LOOKIN AT US DID YOU FEEL SCARED UNCLE DAN'L NO SAH
TAKING IN THE GROUP WITH A QUICK GLANCE HER EYE LIGHTED UP AND WITH A MERRY SMILE SHE ADVANCED AND SHOOK HANDS WITH PHILIP
AND MET PHILIP AND HARRY IN THE HALL RUTH SAID LAUGHING THE TWO TALLEST MUST WALK TOGETHER AND BEFORE PHILIP KNEW HOW IT HAPPENED RUTH HAD TAKEN HARRY'S ARM AND HIS EVENING WAS SPOILED
THE QUESTION WAS THIS
UNLESS YOU CAN GET THE EAR OF A SENATOR OR A CONGRESSMAN OR A CHIEF OF A BUREAU OR DEPARTMENT AND PERSUADE HIM TO USE HIS INFLUENCE IN YOUR BEHALF YOU CANNOT GET AN EMPLOYMENT OF THE MOST TRIVIAL NATURE IN WASHINGTON
WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
ALL THIS WAS IN MANY WAYS SO NEW TO RUTH THAT SHE SEEMED TO HAVE PASSED INTO ANOTHER WORLD IN WHICH SHE EXPERIENCED A FREEDOM AND A MENTAL EXHILARATION UNKNOWN TO HER BEFORE
PHILIP IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD WAS NOT WELL SATISFIED WITH HIS WESTERN PROSPECTS NOR ALTOGETHER WITH THE PEOPLE HE HAD FALLEN IN WITH
BUT IT WAS THAT FEVERISH SORT OF HAPPINESS WHICH IS SNATCHED OUT OF THE BLACK SHADOW OF FALSEHOOD AND IS AT THE MOMENT RECOGNIZED AS FLEETING AND PERILOUS AND INDULGED TREMBLINGLY
PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT WONDER AT SOME THINGS YOU HEAR
90.  RESULT OF A STRAIGHT LINE CHAPTER XIX
NEWSPAPERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE CALLED HIM A PIOUS HYPOCRITE A SLEEK OILY FRAUD A REPTILE WHO MANIPULATED TEMPERANCE MOVEMENTS PRAYER MEETINGS SUNDAY SCHOOLS PUBLIC CHARITIES MISSIONARY ENTERPRISES ALL FOR HIS PRIVATE BENEFIT
IT WAS THE LARGE HEARTED COLONEL WHO IN A MANNER GAVE HIM THE FREEDOM OF THE CITY
AH ME IT MAY BE YEARS IT MAY BE YEARS ARRIVED AT THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL HE THREW HIS COAT UPON THE GROUND SAT DOWN ON A STONE AND HIS EYE SOUGHT THE WESTERING SUN AND DWELT UPON THE CHARMING LANDSCAPE WHICH STRETCHED ITS WOODY RIDGES WAVE UPON WAVE TO THE GOLDEN HORIZON
WITH A GLASS YOU CAN SEE THE COW-SHEDS ABOUT ITS BASE AND THE CONTENTED SHEEP NIMBLING PEBBLES IN THE DESERT SOLITUDES THAT SURROUND IT AND THE TIRED PIGS DOZING IN THE HOLY CALM OF ITS PROTECTING SHADOW
BUT HE HAD TO SUBMIT
WEED HIMSELF WHO HAD STOLEN $20,600,000 FROM THE CITY AND WAS A MAN SO ENVIED SO HONORED,--SO ADORED INDEED THAT WHEN THE SHERIFF WENT TO HIS OFFICE TO ARREST HIM AS A FELON THAT SHERIFF BLUSHED AND APOLOGIZED AND ONE OF THE ILLUSTRATED PAPERS MADE A PICTURE OF THE SCENE AND SPOKE OF THE MATTER IN SUCH A WAY AS TO SHOW THAT THE EDITOR REGRETTED THAT THE OFFENSE OF AN ARREST HAD BEEN OFFERED TO SO EXALTED A PERSONAGE AS MR WEED
THEY WERE ALWAYS TALKING IN THE ROW EVERLASTINGLY GOSSIPING BANTERING AND SARCASTICALLY PRAISING THINGS AND GOING ON IN A STYLE WHICH WAS A CURIOUS COMMINGLING OF EARNEST AND PERSIFLAGE
THIS WOULD HAVE INTERESTED THE CITIZENS BUT IT WAS TOO MANY ON ONE TO AMOUNT TO ANYTHING AS A FIGHT AND SO THEY COMMANDED THE PEACE AND THE FOREIGN DOG COILED HIS TAIL AND TOOK SANCTUARY UNDER THE WAGON
THERE ARE OTHER MEN IN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE WHOM NO ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN HARDY ENOUGH TO APPROACH WITH THAT RELIEF STOCK IN THAT PECULIARLY GENEROUS WAY BUT THEY ARE NOT OF THE CLASS THAT YOU REGARD AS THE BEST AND PUREST
THE LITTLE QUARREL DIDN'T LAST OVER NIGHT FOR HARRY NEVER APPEARED TO CHERISH ANY ILL-WILL HALF A SECOND AND PHILIP WAS TOO SENSIBLE TO CONTINUE A ROW ABOUT NOTHING
KNEW NO REASON WHY HE COULD NOT BE AN IMPARTIAL JUROR
SENATOR DILWORTHY RETIRED TO HIS STUDY
HER THOUGHTS DRIFTED BACK STAGE BY STAGE OVER HER CAREER
I WOULD'NT TAKE THREE FORTUNES FOR ONE LITTLE OPERATION I'VE GOT ON HAND NOW--HAVE ANYTHING FROM THE CASTERS
ON THE WALLS WERE THE BRIGHT YELLOW AND BLACK HANDBILLS OF A TRAVELING CIRCUS WITH PICTURES OF ACROBATS IN HUMAN PYRAMIDS HORSES FLYING IN LONG LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR AND SYLPH-LIKE WOMEN IN A PARADISAIC COSTUME BALANCING THEMSELVES UPON THE TIPS OF THEIR TOES ON THE BARE BACKS OF FRANTIC AND PLUNGING STEEDS AND KISSING THEIR HANDS TO THE SPECTATORS MEANWHILE
HE HAD A DEAR QUAKER AUNT IN PROVIDENCE OF WHOM MRS BOLTON CONSTANTLY REMINDED HIM
I SAW A LADY FROM FLORIDA LAST WEEK AND SHE RECOMMENDED KEY WEST
YOU'LL SEE THE NEWSPAPERS SAY GENERAL SELLERS AND SERVANTS ARRIVED IN THE CITY LAST NIGHT AND IS STOPPING AT THE FIFTH AVENUE
THIS TRIFLING HAD GONE FAR ENOUGH
PERHAPS SHE HAD FELT SOMETIMES HER OWN WEAKNESS AND THE NEED AFTER ALL OF SO DEAR A SYMPATHY AND SO TENDER AN INTEREST CONFESSED AS THAT WHICH PHILIP COULD GIVE
I WOULD NOT HAVE TREATED HIM SO
I THINK THEY ARE ALL GOOD AND CAN ALL BE DONE BUT THEY ARE TIRESOME AND BESIDES THEY REQUIRE MONEY
THEY TALK TWO MINUTES AND A QUARTER AND THEN GO
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME I DON'T DENY THAT IT IS FOR THE INTEREST OF ALL OF US THAT THIS BILL SHOULD GO THROUGH AND IT WILL
LET IT TEACH HIM AND MEN LIKE HIM THAT THEY COULD NOT ATTACK THE REPUTATION OF A UNITED STATES SENATOR WITH IMPUNITY ANOTHER SAID HE WAS GLAD THE INVESTIGATION WAS TO BE HAD FOR IT WAS HIGH TIME THAT THE SENATE SHOULD CRUSH SOME CUR LIKE THIS MAN NOBLE AND THUS SHOW HIS KIND THAT IT WAS ABLE AND RESOLVED TO UPHOLD ITS ANCIENT DIGNITY
AM I IN SOME POPULOUS CENTRE OF MY OWN COUNTRY WHERE THE CHOICEST CHILDREN OF THE LAND HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND BROUGHT TOGETHER AS AT A FAIR FOR A PRIZE
HAWKINS FLUNG HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR
THAT CHAIRMAN WAS NOWHERE IN SIGHT
SHE NEVER WILL BE SATISFIED UNTIL SHE HAS TRIED HER OWN STRENGTH I WISH SAID MARGARET WITH AN INCONSEQUENCE THAT IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY FEMININE THAT SHE WERE IN THE WAY TO FALL IN LOVE AND MARRY BY AND BY
HAD THERE NOT ALWAYS BEEN SOME WAY OUT OF SUCH SCRAPES
ALL THE SAME HE DOTED ON THE OPERA AND KEPT A BOX THERE INTO WHICH HE LOUNGED OCCASIONALLY TO HEAR A FAVORITE SCENE AND MEET HIS SOCIETY FRIENDS
IT ABSORBED HIS WHOLE NATURE AND MADE HIM WRETCHED ENOUGH
I THOUGHT YOU WERE YOU THOUGHT I WAS DEAD
ARE ALL BOOKS LIES
HE WOULD SPEND HALF A DAY IN THESE PREPARATIONS WITHOUT EVER WORKING OUT A PROBLEM OR HAVING THE FAINTEST CONCEPTION OF THE USE OF LINES OR LOGARITHMS
AND NEXT TO THAT HE WOULD HAVE LUXURIATED IN THE IRRESPONSIBLE OMNISCIENCE OF THE SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
I SUPPOSE OUR SOCIETY HERE COMPARES VERY FAVORABLY WITH FRENCH SOCIETY DOES IT NOT MRS OREILLE MRS O.--"NOT BY ANY MEANS MISS HAWKINS
KEEP A RAT PIT GENTLEMEN COMES THERE TO HAVE A LITTLE SPORT
PRESENTLY THEY WERE RANGED ABOUT AN OLD-TIME FIRE-PLACE WHOSE BLAZING LOGS SENT OUT RATHER AN UNNECESSARY AMOUNT OF HEAT BUT THAT WAS NO MATTER--SUPPER WAS NEEDED AND TO HAVE IT IT HAD TO BE COOKED
HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS THE MOST ELEGANT GENTLEMAN IN HIS TERRITORY AND IT WAS CONCEDED BY ALL THAT NO MAN THEREABOUTS WAS ANYWHERE NEAR HIS EQUAL IN THE TELLING OF AN OBSCENE STORY EXCEPT THE VENERABLE WHITE-HAIRED GOVERNOR HIMSELF
THAT SORT OF COAL DOESN'T GO BEGGING WITHIN A MILE OF A RAIL-ROAD
THE GREAT PUBLIC IS WEAK-MINDED
OR TO WASHINGTON PERHAPS
O LIFT YOUR NATURES UP
HAVE YOU ANY CONSCIENTIOUS SCRUPLES ABOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ANY WHICH WOULD YOU OBJECT TO FINDING A PERSON GUILTY--OF MURDER ON EVIDENCE I MIGHT SIR IF I THOUGHT HE WAN'T GUILTY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THOUGHT HE SAW A POINT
BUT TO GO BACK A BIT IT BEGINS TO LOOK AS IF YOU NEVER SAW ANY OF THAT APPROPRIATION AT ALL WE SAW NEARLY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF IT--AND THAT WAS ALL
IF EITHER LADY IS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE CITY SHE GOES TO THE OTHER'S HOUSE AND LEAVES HER CARD WITH P
YOU ACT MIGHTY CURIOUS
HE INSISTED UPON GOING WITH MRS BOLTON AND THE CHILDREN TO THE FRIENDS MEETING ON FIRST DAY WHEN RUTH AND ALICE AND PHILIP WORLD'S PEOPLE WENT TO A CHURCH IN TOWN AND HE SAT THROUGH THE HOUR OF SILENCE WITH HIS HAT ON IN MOST EXEMPLARY PATIENCE
YOU'LL SEE
YOU'LL SEE
YOU'LL SEE
YOU'LL SEE
AND MR HAWKINS RIGHTED HIMSELF
IT ISN'T OUT YET I THINK YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN BECAUSE YOU ADVERTISED IT A WEEK AGO WHY NO--CAN THAT BE SO YES I AM SURE OF IT
AS SOON AS THE JUDGE WAS SEATED THE COURT WAS OPENED WITH THE OI YIS OI YIS OF THE OFFICER IN HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE THE CASE CALLED AND THE SHERIFF WAS DIRECTED TO BRING IN THE PRISONER
WELL NOT ENTIRELY SO PERHAPS
PHILIP'S REPLY WAS A BLOW GIVEN SO SUDDENLY AND PLANTED SO SQUARELY IN THE CONDUCTOR'S FACE THAT IT SENT HIM REELING OVER A FAT PASSENGER WHO WAS LOOKING UP IN MILD WONDER THAT ANY ONE SHOULD DARE TO DISPUTE WITH A CONDUCTOR AND AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE CAR
VERDICT OF JURY NOT GUILTY AND LAURA IS FREE CHAPTER LVIII
COME IT IS EASILY DONE MR TROLLOP
DID SHE COME TO HERSELF
THE POINT UPON WHICH THEY WANTED INSTRUCTION WAS THIS
AND SHE SPOKE HARRY'S NAME LAST THOUGHT PHILIP
HE DON'T WANT THE COMPANY TO GO INTO THIS THING--O THAT'S VERY GOOD
THAT BUILDING IS THE CAPITOL
DID THEE SEE ANYBODY WHOM THEE WOULD LIKE TO LIVE WITH ALWAYS IN FALLKILL NOT ALWAYS REPLIED RUTH WITH A LITTLE LAUGH
IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO REQUIRE THAT HE SHALL GET A NOTE OR A RECEIPT FROM THE MAN HE IS TO CONVEY IT TO IN THE DISTANT TOWN
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH HIM
HAVING TAKEN THE OATH AND KISSED THE BIBLE WITH A SMACK INTENDED TO SHOW HIS GREAT RESPECT FOR THAT BOOK HE BOWED TO HIS HONOR WITH DIGNITY TO THE JURY WITH FAMILIARITY AND THEN TURNED TO THE LAWYERS AND STOOD IN AN ATTITUDE OF SUPERIOR ATTENTION
HE SAID WITH SOME JOCULARITY THAT THE MORE ONE AGITATED THIS THING THE WORSE IT WAS FOR THE AGITATOR
AND AFTER THAT HE CONFINED HIMSELF TO REPEATING THESE AND CEASED TO ORIGINATE ANY MORE LEST HE MIGHT INJURE HIS REPUTATION BY AN UNLUCKY EFFORT
THIS PLEASED HAWKINS BUT IT TROUBLED HIS WIFE
SHE HAD EVEN HEARD WOMEN LECTURERS SAY THAT MARRIAGE SHOULD ONLY CONTINUE SO LONG AS IT PLEASED EITHER PARTY TO IT--FOR A YEAR OR A MONTH OR A DAY
NEVER WHILE I LIVE MR BUCKSTONE INDULGED IN A REVERIE AS HE WALKED HOMEWARD
SELLERS AND MR BRIERLY
I HAVE ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND TO GO THERE MYSELF
AND HERE'S THE RESULT OF IT
RANCHMEN AND FARMERS HAD COME WITH THEIR FAMILIES FROM FIVE MILES AROUND ALL EAGER TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE GREAT MAN--THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN TO WASHINGTON
LOOKS LIKE A WASHINGTON MAN
WASHINGTON HAWKINS AND COL
PEOPLE TRIED TO GET HIM TO DRINK WINE
AND WHAT A MOUNTAIN IT IS
FROM THAT MOMENT ONE COULD FIND THE YOUTH WITH THE SENATOR EVEN OFTENER THAN WITH COL
HIS HOUSE WAS OPEN TO ALL THE LABORERS IN THE FIELD OF TOTAL ABSTINENCE AND MUCH OF HIS TIME WAS TAKEN UP IN ATTENDING THE MEETINGS OF THIS CAUSE
I HAPPEN TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
HE FINALLY SENT THE MAN AWAY AT 3 O'CLOCK ONE MORNING
YOU SEE WHAT IT IS PLACID STEADY NO CURRENT TO INTERFERE WITH NAVIGATION WANTS WIDENING IN PLACES AND DREDGING DREDGE OUT THE HARBOR AND RAISE A LEVEE IN FRONT OF THE TOWN
I AM NOT AFRAID TO TRAVEL BY MYSELF AND SO COMMUNING WITH HERSELF SHE LEFT THE HOUSE FOR AN AFTERNOON WALK
I SUPPOSE SHE KNEW THAT THE SOUTHERNERS ALL GO THERE AND THOUGHT SHE'D FIND HER MAN
IF EVERYBODY HAD STAYED AT HOME AS HE DID HE SAID THE SOUTH NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN CONQUERED
IN THE SAME MATTER-OF-COURSE WAY CLAY HAD HIRED A HORSE AND CART
THERE'S YOUR OFFICIAL SALARIES--YOU CAN'T GET GOOD MEN FOR NOTHING
AND IF THAT COAL SEAM DOES RUN THERE IT'S A MAGNIFICENT FORTUNE
BOTH THE GIRLS STARTED
LOOK AT ME
PHILIP WAS GREATLY TROUBLED AND EXAGGERATED HIS OWN SHARE IN THE BRINGING ABOUT OF THE CALAMITY
IT WAS ENOUGH FOR LAURA TO HEAR HIS VOICE AND BE NEAR HIM
YES SIR
YES SIR
NOW IF YOU WILL LISTEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT THIS MUST BE THE LIST OF STATISTICS WHICH WAS TO BE THE NUB OF YOUR GREAT EFFORT AND THE ACCOMPANYING BLAST THE BEGINNING OF THE BURST OF ELOQUENCE WHICH WAS CONTINUED ON THE NEXT PAGE--AND YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS WHERE YOU BROKE DOWN SHE READ THE PAGE
HER HIGH SOCIAL POSITION IN WASHINGTON THE UNPARALLED CALMNESS WITH WHICH THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED HAD ALL CONSPIRED TO FIX THE EVENT IN THE PUBLIC MIND ALTHOUGH NEARLY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-FIVE SUBSEQUENT MURDERS HAD OCCURRED TO VARY THE MONOTONY OF METROPOLITAN LIFE
THE ABSENCE OF A PLANK HERE AND THERE IN THE FLOORING MADE THE CROSSING OF THE BRIDGE FASTER THAN A WALK AN OFFENSE NOT NECESSARY TO BE PROHIBITED BY LAW
NEITHER OF THE YOUNG MEN FELT LIKE ATTEMPTING TO SEE LAURA THAT DAY AND SHE SAW NO COMPANY EXCEPT THE NEWSPAPER REPORTERS UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF COL
IT WAS LIKE THE BREAKING UP OF LIFE
BUT WHAT A COWARD THE MAN WAS TO BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE EXPOSED THAT PAGE IN THE ROTUNDA AND SO EXPOSED MYSELF
HE MADE MANY ATTEMPTS BUT THEY WERE LAME
THERE COMES ANOTHER DAY OF AGONY
BY THE DATES THESE LETTERS WERE FROM FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS OLD
HUSBAND AND THE OTHER TWO CHILDREN DIED IN THE SPRING AND SHE HAIN'T EVER HILT UP HER HEAD SENCE
I NEVER INTENDED TO COME TO SUCH A PLACE AS THIS OLD FELLOW HE SAID TO PHILIP
A BODY CAN'T ANSWER EVERY QUESTION RIGHT OFF-HAND
I'VE BEEN OFFERED--WELL I WOULDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BELIEVE WHAT I'VE BEEN OFFERED FOR THAT CLOCK
IT TOOK BUT A TRIFLE TO PAY HAWKINS'S OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS FOR HE HAD ALWAYS HAD A HORROR OF DEBT
JUST AS I USED TO SAY--SHE'LL BE A CARD IN THE MATTER OF--YES SIR
I AM A BUSINESS MAN
THEN WITH THIS CARVING KNIFE WE'LL CONTINUE THE RAILROAD FROM SLOUCHBURG TO DOODLEVILLE SHOWN BY THE BLACK PEPPER
ALL READY THE BOAT HESITATED--SEEMED TO HOLD HER BREATH AS DID THE CAPTAIN AND PILOTS--AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO FALL AWAY TO STARBOARD AND EVERY EYE LIGHTED
HAPPY IN THE FREEDOM OF HER LIFE AND IN THE KEEN ENJOYMENT OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT BROADENED ITS FIELD DAY BY DAY
THERE WAS ONE LITTLE BAD BOY WHO WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM BUT HE NEVER COULD
I SHOULDN'T CARE
NOW THE HEAD OF IT WAS AT HAND
HE HAD GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ALSO CUSTOM HOUSES AND DRY DOCKS FROM PORTLAND TO NEW ORLEANS AND MANAGED TO GET OUT OF CONGRESS IN APPROPRIATIONS ABOUT WEIGHT FOR WEIGHT OF GOLD FOR THE STONE FURNISHED
BUT THERE WAS A PERSON IN HIS STATE LEGISLATURE WHO DID NEED WATCHING--A PERSON WHO SENATOR DILWORTHY SAID WAS A NARROW GRUMBLING UNCOMFORTABLE MALCONTENT--A PERSON WHO WAS STOLIDLY OPPOSED TO REFORM AND PROGRESS AND HIM,--A PERSON WHO HE FEARED HAD BEEN BOUGHT WITH MONEY TO COMBAT HIM AND THROUGH HIM THE COMMONWEALTH'S WELFARE AND ITS POLITICS PURITY
LEAVE ME AND DILWORTHY TO TAKE CARE OF THAT
TAP
BETTER INFORMED THAN RUTH AND WITH A MUCH MORE VARIED CULTURE AND BRIGHT AND SYMPATHETIC HE WAS NEVER WEARY OF HER COMPANY IF HE WAS NOT GREATLY EXCITED BY IT
YOU BETRAYED ME AND LEFT ME MOCKING ME AND TRAMPLING ME INTO THE DUST A SOILED CAST-OFF
IT WAS ALWAYS SO
I WILL WORK FOR THE BILL--THE INCORPORATORSHIP WILL BE A VERY GOOD THING AS SOON AS MR TROLLOP HAD TAKEN HIS LEAVE LAURA RAN TO SENATOR DILWORTHY AND BEGAN TO SPEAK BUT HE INTERRUPTED HER AND SAID DISTRESSFULLY WITHOUT EVEN TURNING FROM HIS WRITING TO LOOK AT HER
IT IS A TEDIOUS DISTANCE TO NEWPORT
BUT HOLDING ON TOO LONG HAD UTTERLY RUINED BOTH OF THEM
AND DO NOT FEAR FOR ME
WHY DID YOU DEAL IN BANK BILLS ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION THE CHAIRMAN--"THE GENTLEMAN WILL PLEASE TO REMEMBER THAT THE COMMITTEE IS CONDUCTING THIS INVESTIGATION MR NOBLE--"THEN WILL THE COMMITTEE ASK THE QUESTION THE CHAIRMAN--"THE COMMITTEE WILL--WHEN IT DESIRES TO KNOW MR NOBLE--"WHICH WILL NOT BE DURING THIS CENTURY PERHAPS THE CHAIRMAN--"ANOTHER REMARK LIKE THAT SIR WILL PROCURE YOU THE ATTENTIONS OF THE SERGEANT-AT-ARMS MR NOBLE--"D--N THE SERGEANT-AT-ARMS AND THE COMMITTEE TOO SEVERAL COMMITTEEMEN--"MR CHAIRMAN THIS IS CONTEMPT MR NOBLE--"CONTEMPT OF WHOM OF THE COMMITTEE
HE CALLED LAURA MY DAUGHTER NEXT MORNING AND GAVE HER SOME PIN MONEY AS HE TERMED IT AND SHE SENT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS OF IT TO HER MOTHER AND LOANED A TRIFLE TO COL
IT NEEDED IN FACT NO WORD FROM HIM FOR SHE SAW CLEARLY ENOUGH WHAT WAS GOING FORWARD AND KNEW HER SEX WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THERE WAS NO REMEDY FOR IT BUT TIME
THE CONTRACTORS HAD GIVEN THE YOUNG MEN LEAVE TO JOIN THE ENGINEER CORPS AS SOON AS THEY COULD BUT OTHERWISE HAD MADE NO PROVISION FOR THEM AND IN FACT HAD LEFT THEM WITH ONLY THE MOST INDEFINITE EXPECTATIONS OF SOMETHING LARGE IN THE FUTURE
GOOD-NIGHT GOOD-BYE--WE'LL MARSHAL OUR FORCES AND MARCH WITH THE DAWN LAURA REFLECTED A WHILE WHEN SHE WAS ALONE AND THEN FELL TO LAUGHING PEACEFULLY
PERHAPS THIS LOVE WAS KINDLING A NEW HEROISM IN HIM
A MURMUR OF ADMIRATION RAN THROUGH THE ROOM
I MOVE WE TAKE A DRINK ON IT ALL ROUND THE PROPOSAL MET WITH UNIVERSAL FAVOR
AND THE BLACK PAST AND THE TROUBLED PRESENT AND THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE COULD NOT SNATCH THAT FROM HER
INTO THIS SELECT CIRCLE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GAIN ADMISSION
I SHOULD THINK THEY WERE MANUFACTURED IN THE NEW YORK CUSTOM HOUSE
HE ACCOMPANIED MISS HAWKINS TO NEW YORK AT HER REQUEST SUPPOSING SHE WAS COMING IN RELATION TO A BILL THEN PENDING IN CONGRESS TO SECURE THE ATTENDANCE OF ABSENT MEMBERS
OF COURSE NOT OF COURSE NOT NODDED MR BRAHAM TO THE JURY
THE FIRST PRELIMINARY IT ALWAYS STARTS OUT ON IS TO CLEAN ITSELF SO TO SPEAK
HE SAW THE ROAD ON WHICH LAURA WAS GOING CLEARLY ENOUGH THOUGH HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE WORST HE HEARD OF HER
IT IS EVERYTHING TO HIM
THE BREAKFAST WAS NOT AN IMPROVEMENT UPON THE SUPPER BUT THE COLONEL TALKED IT UP AND TRANSFORMED IT INTO AN ORIENTAL FEAST
ON HER TABLE LAY SIX OR SEVEN NOTES
AND YET SHE CONFESSED THAT IF ONE MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREME ARISTOCRACIES IT MIGHT BE BEST ON THE WHOLE LOOKING AT THINGS FROM A STRICTLY BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW TO HERD WITH THE PARVENUS
THE CASE WAS FELT TO TURN UPON THE ADMISSION OR REJECTION OF THIS EVIDENCE
LONG TRAINS OF COAL CARS LADEN AND UNLADEN STOOD UPON SIDINGS
BY GEORGE THAT'S MORTIFYING
IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO LOOK UPON THE LIFE OF THIS MOST BEAUTIFUL AND ACCOMPLISHED OF HER SEX BLASTED BY THE HEARTLESS VILLAINY OF MAN WITHOUT SEEING AT THE END OF IT
NEGROES WOULD HAVE GONE UP TO FOUR PRICES
THEY WONDERED IF ALL SENSE OF DECENCY WAS DEAD IN THIS SHAMELESS MURDERESS THIS BRAZEN LOBBYIST THIS HEARTLESS SEDUCER OF THE AFFECTIONS OF WEAK AND MISGUIDED MEN
ONCE I WAS NEAR SELLING THE LAND FOR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
THE SENATOR WAS THE GUEST OF HIS OLD FRIEND GEN
THIS HOME WHICH HE HAD HOPED HIS CHILDREN WOULD ENJOY LONG AFTER HE HAD DONE WITH IT MUST GO
I KNOW YOU'RE DOING ALL YOU CAN AND I DON'T WANT TO SEEM REPINING AND UNGRATEFUL--FOR I'M NOT BERIAH--YOU KNOW I'M NOT DON'T YOU LORD BLESS YOU CHILD I KNOW YOU ARE THE VERY BEST LITTLE WOMAN THAT EVER LIVED--THAT EVER LIVED ON THE WHOLE FACE OF THE EARTH
GOM RIGHT IN PHILIP WAS SHOWN INTO A DIRTY BAR-ROOM
AND THIS INDISTINCT SHADOW REPRESENTED HER FATHER
HE WOULD NOT LET BAD BOYS PERSUADE HIM TO GO TO PLAY ON SUNDAY
IT'S EASY ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER FELLOW TO TALK SAID HARRY DESPONDINGLY AFTER HE HAD PUT PHILIP IN POSSESSION OF HIS VIEW OF THE CASE
TO THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH OF EVERY DETAIL OF MY STATEMENT I SOLEMNLY SWEAR AND I CALL HIM TO WITNESS WHO IS THE TRUTH AND THE LOVING FATHER OF ALL WHOSE LIPS ABHOR FALSE SPEAKING
DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY WILL BE SO BARBAROUS AS THAT I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT--IT'S DOUBTFUL IF A NEW YORK JURY WOULD FIND A WOMAN GUILTY OF ANY SUCH CRIME
A DREARY OLD HAIR-CLOTH SOFA AGAINST THE WALL
SELLERS'S WAS NOT SUMPTUOUS IN THE BEGINNING BUT IT IMPROVED ON ACQUAINTANCE
HE WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH WASHINGTON AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ADJUST HIS FEELINGS AND PERCEPTIONS TO ITS PECULIARITIES
IT WAS A NOBLE MEASURE
IT'S AS NATURAL TO THEM AS NOSES ARE--AND SIN
WE DID NOT DISCOVER IT FROM YOUR LETTERS--WHICH WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED
THEY WERE ALL FROM MAJOR LACKLAND TO MR HAWKINS
HOW THE LAND LAY AT STONE'S LANDING HE CORDIALLY SHOOK HANDS WITH THAT GENTLEMAN ASKED HIM TO DRINK AND FAIRLY ROARED OUT WHY GOD BLESS MY SOUL COLONEL A WORD FROM ONE VIRGINIA GENTLEMAN TO ANOTHER IS NUFF CED THERE'S STONE'S LANDING BEEN WAITING FOR A RAILROAD MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AND DAMME IF SHE SHAN'T HAVE IT PHILIP HAD NOT SO MUCH FAITH AS HARRY IN STONE'S LANDING WHEN THE LATTER OPENED THE PROJECT TO HIM BUT HARRY TALKED ABOUT IT AS IF HE ALREADY OWNED THAT INCIPIENT CITY
WE WANT TO WORK THREE DAYS MORE
I WAS THE FRIEND MYSELF
M
YOU ARE ASSAILED BY A LONG RANK OF HACKMEN WHO SHAKE THEIR WHIPS IN YOUR FACE AS YOU STEP OUT UPON THE SIDEWALK
HE DID NOT KNOW OUT OF WHAT MATERIALS A WOMAN CAN CONSTRUCT A HERO WHEN SHE IS IN THE CREATIVE MOOD
RUTH COULD HAVE HAD NO SUCH THOUGHT FOR WITH A PITY IN HER SWEET FACE THAT FOR THE MOMENT OVERCAME FEAR AND DISGUST SHE REVERENTLY REPLACED THE COVERING AND WENT AWAY TO HER OWN TABLE AS HER COMPANION DID TO HERS
STAND BY DOWN THERE WITH THAT LABBOARD LEAD NO I DON'T WANT THE LEAD SAID THE PILOT I WANT YOU
WHEN THE NEWS CAME OF MR BOLTON'S FAILURE OF COURSE THE WORK STOPPED
AT ANY RATE WHEN HE AT LENGTH WENT AWAY FROM HAWKEYE HE WAS NO NEARER IT
OH HEAVENS HOW I DID LOVE THAT MAN
IT IS THE LAND
BUT THE MAN WAS NO LONGER IN THE TOWN
NOW COULD THAT MAN--IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I--HANGED IF I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE MISSED A CHANCE
STRANGE
NO DO NOT INSIST--I MUST HAVE MY WAY IN THIS THEN MR BUCKSTONE DREW OFF HIS FORCES AND PROCEEDED TO MAKE A WILY ADVANCE UPON THE FORTRESS UNDER COVER OF CAREFULLY-CONTRIVED ARTIFICES AND STRATAGEMS OF WAR
AND IT'S THE NATURAL CENTER OF ALL THAT REGION OF HEMP AND TOBACCO WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THE ROAD WILL GO THERE
THAT ABOUT GAUGES HIM
SELBY SAUCE-BOX NOTHING PROBABLY YOU'LL CARE FOR
HE GREW IRRITABLE JEALOUS AND VERY UNHAPPY
SOMETIMES SHE PETTED HIM AND COAXED HIM AND TRIED ALL HER FASCINATIONS
AFTER THE RECOVERY OF LAURA FROM HER LONG ILLNESS DID MRS HAWKINS THINK THERE WERE ANY SIGNS OF INSANITY ABOUT HER
SHE WONDERED IF SHE WERE NOT MAD
VEGETABLES OF COURSE YOU CAN'T EXPECT HERE
IF HE COULD ONLY HAVE ONE MORE CHANCE HE WAS SURE HE COULD RIGHT HIMSELF
THE SIGHT-SEERS RETURNED IN HIGH SPIRITS FROM THE CITY
HE HAD NO PROJECTS FORMED NO PLANS--EVIDENTLY HE WAS A VANQUISHED MAN
SELLERS AND WASHINGTON HAWKINS WHO HAD HASTENED TO NEW YORK WITH ALL SPEED
BUT RUTH LOOKED UP AND THERE WAS A LIGHT IN HER EYES THAT QUICKENED PHIL'S PULSE
ALL BUT THE RAILS AND THE IRONHORSE I RECKON YOU KIN GIT ALL THE RAILS YOU WANT OATEN MY WHITE OAK TIMBER OVER THAR REPLIED THE FIRST SPEAKER WHO APPEARED TO BE A MAN OF PROPERTY AND WILLING TO STRIKE UP A TRADE
HAWKINS EVEN BUILT A NEW HOUSE MADE IT TWO FULL STORIES HIGH AND PUT A LIGHTNING ROD ON IT
BRIGHT AND EARLY IN THE MORNING THE FAMILY WERE ASTIR AND ALL WERE BUSY PREPARING WASHINGTON FOR HIS JOURNEY--AT LEAST ALL BUT WASHINGTON HIMSELF WHO SAT APART STEEPED IN A REVERIE
THE BELOVED FORM IN THE COFFIN
EVERY SQUARE MILE OF GROUND UPHOLDS ITS THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF STRUGGLING HUMAN CREATURES--AND EVERY SEPARATE AND INDIVIDUAL DEVIL OF THEM'S GOT THE OPHTHALMIA
NOW YOU SET YOUR FOOT ON SHORE IN NOVO ORBE
A BY-STANDER LAUGHED AT THIS FINELY DELIVERED PERORATION
THE COLONEL'S STOVEPIPE HAT WAS NAPLESS AND SHINY WITH MUCH POLISHING BUT NEVERTHELESS IT HAD AN ALMOST CONVINCING EXPRESSION ABOUT IT OF HAVING BEEN JUST PURCHASED NEW
I WILL MAKE IT AN OBJECT TO YOU TO WORK FOR THE BILL DON'T MAKE IT UNNECESSARILY PLAIN PLEASE
ON THE WAY UP TOWN THESE ADVENTURERS BOUGHT BOOKS ON ENGINEERING AND SUITS OF INDIA-RUBBER WHICH THEY SUPPOSED THEY WOULD NEED IN A NEW AND PROBABLY DAMP COUNTRY AND MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH NOBODY EVER NEEDED ANYWHERE
THE VISIT OF SENATOR ABNER DILWORTHY WAS AN EVENT IN HAWKEYE
THE DARKNESS GROWS
AND WHEN THEE HAS GOT THE EDUCATION THEE WANTS AND LOST ALL RELISH FOR THE SOCIETY OF THY FRIENDS AND THE WAYS OF THY ANCESTORS WHAT THEN RUTH TURNED SQUARE ROUND TO HER MOTHER AND WITH AN IMPASSIVE FACE AND NOT THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE OF TONE SAID MOTHER I'M GOING TO STUDY MEDICINE MARGARET BOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLACIDITY
OTHER AID WAS SUMMONED BUT THE WOUNDS WERE MORTAL AND COL SELBY EXPIRED IN AN HOUR IN PAIN BUT HIS MIND WAS CLEAR TO THE LAST AND HE MADE A FULL DEPOSITION
SO THE WORK CONTINUED ON MONDAY
FORTUNATELY WE ONLY NEED TO DEAL WITH LAURA'S LIFE AT THIS PERIOD HISTORICALLY AND LOOK BACK UPON SUCH PORTIONS OF IT AS WILL SERVE TO REVEAL THE WOMAN AS SHE WAS AT THE TIME OF THE ARRIVAL OF MR HARRY BRIERLY IN HAWKEYE
O SEE YE NOT YON NARROW ROAD SO THICK BESET WI THORNS AND BRIERS
WELL MRS MONTAGUE IF YOU MUST KNOW AND HARRY STOPPED TO LIGHT A CIGAR AND THEN PUFFED ON IN SILENCE
AH THINK OF THAT NOW
HARRY SAID HE HAD WRITTEN TO HURRY UP THE MONEY AND IT WOULD BE ALONG PRESENTLY
BUT THEY WERE HONEST AND STRAIGHTFORWARD AND THEIR VIRTUOUS WAYS COMMANDED RESPECT
THOUGH I GRANT OF COURSE THAT IT IS NOT A LARGE SUM STRICTLY SPEAKING
SELLERS CONTINUING HIS TESTIMONY SAID THAT HE SAW THIS LOST LETTER BUT COULD NOT NOW RECALL THE NAME
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE ABOUT THE MOOD AND TENSE OF A MERE VERB
THE TOWN DIGNITARIES SAT IN AN IMPRESSIVE ROW WITHIN THE ALTAR RAILINGS BELOW
I WANT NO INTRODUCTION
VAGRANT DOGS CAME WAGGING AROUND AND MAKING INQUIRIES OF HAWKINS'S DOG WHICH WERE NOT SATISFACTORY AND THEY MADE WAR ON HIM IN CONCERT
REALLY YOU SEEM TO KNOW MY AFFAIRS BETTER THAN I DO MYSELF I BELIEVE I DO
GAVE FURTHER PROOFS OF HIS POWER BY TELLING NOBLE EVERYTHING THE OPPOSING PARTY HAD DONE OR SAID IN SECRET CAUCUS
THE NEWSPAPERS CLAMORED AND THE COURTS PROCEEDED TO TRY THE NEW LEGISLATORS FOR THEIR SMALL IRREGULARITIES
A GREAT MANY LAY UPON THEIR BREASTS UPON THE DESKS SOUND ASLEEP AND GENTLY SNORING
AS THEY WERE LIKELY TO BE DETAINED SOME TIME IN THE CITY HARRY TOLD PHILIP THAT HE WAS GOING TO IMPROVE HIS TIME
AND BEFORE COL
AND THEN SHE WILL TELL YOU THAT SHE IS FULL THEN YOU SHOW HER HER ADVERTISEMENT IN THE MORNING PAPER AND THERE SHE STANDS CONVICTED AND ASHAMED
HE HAS A COTTON CLAIM
TEMPTATIONS LAY ALL ABOUT HIM AND SOMETIMES HE WAS ABOUT TO YIELD BUT HE WOULD THINK OF SOME PRECIOUS LESSON HE LEARNED IN HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL A LONG TIME AGO AND THAT WOULD SAVE HIM
AND YOU COULD OWN THE LAND
IN A SECOND MORE THOSE INFURIATED MEN WOULD BE OVER THE BENCHES AND CRUSHING RUTH AND ALICE UNDER THEIR BOOTS
AND THIS ISN'T EVEN THE BEGINNING
THE MOON ROSE AND SAILED ALOFT THROUGH A MAZE OF SHREDDED CLOUD-WREATHS
THE LAST I HAD IN MY CELLAR FROM A LOT SENT ME BY SIR GEORGE GORE--TOOK HIM OUT ON A BUFFALO HUNT WHEN HE VISITED OUR COUNTRY
THERE WERE LONG SPECIALS FROM WASHINGTON GIVING A FULL HISTORY OF LAURA'S CAREER THERE WITH THE NAMES OF MEN WITH WHOM SHE WAS SAID TO BE INTIMATE A DESCRIPTION OF SENATOR DILWORTHY'S RESIDENCE AND OF HIS FAMILY AND OF LAURA'S ROOM IN HIS HOUSE AND A SKETCH OF THE SENATOR'S APPEARANCE AND WHAT HE SAID
I REMEMBER HEARING THEM TELL ABOUT THE BLACK MOHAWK I'M FREE TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE IT AND THE MEN ALL THINK SO TOO
CONTENTS CHAPTER I
CHANGE THEM INTO INTELLIGENT TRAINED WORKMEN AND YOU INCREASED AT ONCE THE CAPITAL THE RESOURCES OF THE ENTIRE SOUTH WHICH WOULD ENTER UPON A PROSPERITY HITHERTO UNKNOWN
CHAPTER XXIV
ASSESSMENT YOU SEE
WHEN RUTH STOOD BY HIS SIDE CLOTHED IN WHITE WITH A FACE LIKE THAT OF AN ANGEL RADIANT SMILING POINTING TO THE SKY AND SAYING COME HE AWOKE WITH A CRY--THE TRAIN WAS ROARING THROUGH A BRIDGE AND IT SHOT OUT INTO DAYLIGHT
OF COURSE YOU CONTRIVE TO SEE EVERYTHING AND FIND OUT EVERYTHING
HIS OIL-CLOTH WINDOW-CURTAINS HAD NOBLE PICTURES ON THEM OF CASTLES SUCH AS HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BUT ON WINDOW-CURTAINS
HE FOUND HIMSELF DRAGGED INTO SOCIETY AND COURTED WONDERED AT AND ENVIED VERY MUCH AS IF HE WERE ONE OF THOSE FOREIGN BARBERS WHO FLIT OVER HERE NOW AND THEN WITH A SELF-CONFERRED TITLE OF NOBILITY AND MARRY SOME RICH FOOL'S ABSURD DAUGHTER
IT OCCURRED TO HIM NOW THAT THE COLONEL HAD NOT INVITED HIM LATELY--COULD HE BE OFFENDED
CHAPTER XXII
I'VE LET IT OUT
SHE WAS WELL SATISFIED NOW THAT HER BEAUTY WAS CONFESSED HER MIND A GRADE ABOVE THE AVERAGE AND HER POWERS OF FASCINATION RATHER EXTRAORDINARY
NO TIME OR DISTANCE HOWEVER WOULD EVER LESSEN HIS INTEREST IN HER
TREMENDOUS SENSATION
I FEEL SHE ONCE SAID TO HER FATHER AS IF I WERE LIVING IN A HOUSE OF CARDS AND THEE WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT INTO A HOSPITAL NO
WHAT IS THERE TO FEAR IN A PERSON DEAD MORE THAN IN A PERSON LIVING BUT THY HEALTH AND STRENGTH CHILD
THE TRUTH IS THAT THE COUNTRY COUSINS HAD COME TO TOWN TO ATTEND THE YEARLY MEETING AND THE AMOUNT OF SHOPPING THAT PRECEDED THAT RELIGIOUS EVENT WAS SCARCELY EXCEEDED BY THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE OPERA IN MORE WORLDLY CIRCLES
YOU CAN'T IMPROVE ON THESE--NO MAN CAN IMPROVE ON THEM A SWEET COMPASSIONATE SMILE PLAYED ABOUT THE COLONEL'S FEATURES AND HE LEANED OVER THE TABLE WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS GOING TO SHOW YOU AND DO IT WITHOUT THE LEAST TROUBLE
IT WAS FOUND THAT HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST AND THROUGH THE ABDOMEN
LOOKED BETTER ALL THE TIME WHEN DID YOU STRIKE IT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK THEN YOU'VE BEEN PROSPECTING ABOUT FOUR HOURS YES BEEN SINKING ON IT SOMETHING OVER FOUR HOURS I'M AFRAID YOU COULDN'T GO DOWN VERY FAR IN FOUR HOURS--COULD YOU O YES--IT'S A GOOD DEAL BROKE UP NOTHING BUT PICKING AND GADDING STUFF WELL IT DOES LOOK ENCOURAGING SURE ENOUGH--BUT THEN THE LACKING INDICATIONS I'D RATHER WE HAD THEM MR STERLING BUT I'VE SEEN MORE THAN ONE GOOD PERMANENT MINE STRUCK WITHOUT EM IN MY TIME WELL THAT IS ENCOURAGING TOO YES THERE WAS THE UNION THE ALABAMA AND THE BLACK MOHAWK--ALL GOOD SOUND MINES YOU KNOW--ALL JUST EXACTLY LIKE THIS ONE WHEN WE FIRST STRUCK THEM WELL I BEGIN TO FEEL A GOOD DEAL MORE EASY
SOME OF THE NOBLEST MEN OF THE TIME SUCCUMBED TO HER FASCINATIONS
HALF THE COURT ROOM WAS IN TEARS
I WISH YOU COULD STAY TO DINNER MARIA--WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SAUSAGES
PRESENTLY TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND THOUGHT RATHER THAN SAID
SHE SAID
SHE SAID
SHE SAID
SHE SAID
SHE SAID
THIS UNDERHANDED MERCENARY CREATURE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN ME UP--AND RUINED ME
BUT HERE I AM RUNNING ON AS IF BUSINESS MEN HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT LISTEN TO WOMEN TALK
EVERYTHING WAS LOOKING WELL AND YET IT WAS PLAIN THAT ONE VIGOROUS AND DETERMINED ENEMY MIGHT EVENTUALLY SUCCEED IN OVERTHROWING ALL HER PLANS
SELLERS HAD ASKED HIM SEVERAL TIMES TO DINE WITH HIM WHEN HE FIRST RETURNED TO HAWKEYE BUT WASHINGTON FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON HAD NOT ACCEPTED
EVIDENTLY SOME OF THE LETTERS WERE MISSING FOR THE NAME OF THE INQUIRER WAS NOT MENTIONED
THE LOCALITY WAS OBEDSTOWN EAST TENNESSEE
WAS HER HUSBAND EVER COLD OR INDIFFERENT
SO SHE TRAVELED TO HARDING ON THE PRETENCE WE HAVE MENTIONED AND WAS MARRIED
WOULD I GO TO ALL THAT TROUBLE AND BOTHER FOR THE POOR CRUMBS A BODY MIGHT PICK UP IN THIS COUNTRY
YOU THINK I AM AS POWERLESS AS THAT DAY I FELL DEAD AT YOUR FEET SHE RAGED NOW
IT'S A LONG TURN THAT HAS NO LANE AT THE END OF IT AS THE PROVERB SAYS OR SOMEHOW THAT WAY
BUT PRESENTLY MADE HIS ADIEUX AND HAD GOT AS FAR AS THE HALL WHEN SOMETHING OCCURRED TO LAURA
HE COULD SCARCELY SEE THAT HE MADE ANY PROGRESS
HE HAD COME HOME THAT DAY EARLY UNUSUALLY DEJECTED
WE WANT NO MONEY
IT'S ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT WILL STAY ON HIS STOMACH NOW-A-DAYS
REPROACH ME
STILL PHILIP FELT THAT IF HE WAS GOING TO MAKE EITHER REPUTATION OR MONEY AS AN ENGINEER HE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF HARD STUDY BEFORE HIM AND IT IS TO HIS CREDIT THAT HE DID NOT SHRINK FROM IT
TO THE SURPRISE OF ALICE RUTH TOOK TO THE SMALL GAIETIES OF THE VILLAGE WITH A ZEST OF ENJOYMENT THAT SEEMED FOREIGN TO ONE WHO HAD DEVOTED HER LIFE TO A SERIOUS PROFESSION FROM THE HIGHEST MOTIVES
BUT BIGLER COULD RAISE IT ON HIS NAME
IN FACT I AM SATISFIED YOU ARE
AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN IT THAT HIS ENTERPRISE CAN DIG OUT HE SHALL HAVE AN INTEREST
IT NEEDS A GOLDEN WAND TO STRIKE THAT ROCK
GIVE ME YOUR HAND MY BOY
POOR CHILD IT MIGHT HAVE BROKEN HER HEART TO LET HER MIND GET TO RUNNING ON SUCH A THING AS THAT
THE MOMENT THE HANDS POINT TO EIGHT I WILL STEP UPON THE PLATFORM HE DISAPPEARED
FATHER AND HE WERE FAMOUS FRIENDS
PHILIP THOUGHT AT ONCE OF COL
SELLERS WAS PLEASED TO SEE THIS INTEREST THAT WASHINGTON HAD AWAKENED ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WAS LIKELY TO FURTHER HIS EXPECTATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE TENNESSEE LANDS
LAUNCHED INTO JERSEY ONE HAS A VAGUE NOTION THAT HE IS ON MANY LINES AND NO ONE IN PARTICULAR AND THAT HE IS LIABLE AT ANY MOMENT TO COME TO ELIZABETH
NOT THAT I KNEW SAID BIGLER SHAKING HIS HEAD IN DISGUST
HE INTENDED TO USE THIS INVENTION IN THE CAPTURE OF ST LOUIS EXPLODING HIS TORPEDOES OVER THE CITY AND RAINING DESTRUCTION UPON IT UNTIL THE ARMY OF OCCUPATION WOULD GLADLY CAPITULATE
IF IT WAS WIDENED AND DEEPENED AND STRAIGHTENED AND MADE LONG ENOUGH IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE FINEST RIVERS IN THE WESTERN COUNTRY AS THE SUN ROSE AND SENT HIS LEVEL BEAMS ALONG THE STREAM THE THIN STRATUM OF MIST OR MALARIA ROSE ALSO AND DISPERSED BUT THE LIGHT WAS NOT ABLE TO ENLIVEN THE DULL WATER NOR GIVE ANY HINT OF ITS APPARENTLY FATHOMLESS DEPTH
I THINK THAT NO INFORMATION EVER COMES AMISS IN THIS WORLD
YOU WILL CONFINE YOURSELF COL
I'VE GOT IT I'VE GOT IT WHAT'S YOURS SAID HARRY
THAT'S GOOD ECONOMY ISN'T IT YES YES BUT CHILD ALL CONGRESSMEN DO THAT
THE WHOLE WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN A BARBER'S SHOP
THEN HE PROPPED THE STOVE DOOR TO ITS PLACE BY LEANING THE POKER AGAINST IT FOR THE HINGES HAD RETIRED FROM BUSINESS
THE MATRONLY LITTLE WIFE OF THE COLONEL MOVED HITHER AND THITHER AND IN AND OUT WITH HER POTS AND PANS IN HER HANDS HAPPINESS IN HER HEART AND A WORLD OF ADMIRATION OF HER HUSBAND IN HER EYES
WHEN SHE BOWED HER ADIEU AND TURNED AWAY HE WAS NO LONGER SUFFERING TORTURE IN THE PILLORY WHERE SHE HAD HAD HIM TRUSSED UP DURING SO MANY DISTRESSING MOMENTS BUT HE BELONGED TO THE LIST OF HER CONQUESTS AND WAS A FLATTERED AND HAPPY THRALL WITH THE DAWN-LIGHT OF LOVE BREAKING OVER THE EASTERN ELEVATIONS OF HIS HEART
FOR A SECOND HER HEART STOPPED BEATING
THERE MIGHT BE BURGLARS ABOUT
THERE WERE THREE MINUTE AND DIFFERENT STATEMENTS FROM THE DOCTORS ABOUT THE WOUNDS SO TECHNICALLY WORDED THAT NOBODY COULD UNDERSTAND THEM
SENATOR DILWORTHY DESCENDED TO THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE AND THEY WENT TO MEET HIM
FOR WHICH OF YOU WILL STOP THE VENT OF HEARING WHEN LOUD RUMOR SPEAKS
THEY HAD FOUND COAL OF EXCELLENT QUALITY BUT THEY COULD NOT YET TELL WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY WHAT THE VEIN WAS
COMMON THING I ASSURE YOU IN WASHINGTON
HANG'D IF I KNOW COMPANY SAY ANYTHING NOT A WORD YOU TELEGRAPHED YESTERDAY YES AND THE DAY BEFORE TOO NO ANSWER NONE-CONFOUND THEM THEN THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE
THE CROWD SWAYS WITH THE RISE AND FALL OF THE SHIFTING TESTIMONY IN SYMPATHETIC INTEREST AND HANGS UPON THE DICTA OF THE JUDGE IN BREATHLESS SILENCE
SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION CAN DO LITTLE TO FILL OUT THE PICTURE
AS THE MONTHS WENT BY HE CAME TO BE REGARDED AS A WONDERFULLY LUCKY MAN
LOUISE'S FATHER WAS CALLED RICH BUT LAURA DOUBTED IF LOUISE HAD EVER HAD $400 WORTH OF NEW CLOTHING AT ONE TIME IN HER LIFE
BUT HER BRAIN WAS IN A WHIRL
NOR BY THE TREATMENT OUR DRAFTS HAVE MET WITH--WHICH WERE NOT HONORED
THE WEEKS DRIFTED BY MONOTONOUSLY ENOUGH NOW
DENNIS LAFIN LABORER
AND NOW THE SUN ROSE ONCE MORE AND USHERED IN THE FIRST DAY OF WHAT LAURA COMPREHENDED AND ACCEPTED AS A NEW LIFE
M ON WEDNESDAY AT 3 P
BOTH CHATTED AWAY IN HIGH SPIRITS AND MADE THE EVENING WHIRL ALONG IN THE MOST MIRTHFUL MANNER
THE OCCASION DID NOT PASS WITHOUT IMPROVEMENT BY THE LEADING JOURNALS
THERE WERE NO MANTEL ORNAMENTS UNLESS ONE MIGHT BRING HIMSELF TO REGARD AS AN ORNAMENT A CLOCK WHICH NEVER CAME WITHIN FIFTEEN STROKES OF STRIKING THE RIGHT TIME AND WHOSE HANDS ALWAYS HITCHED TOGETHER AT TWENTY-TWO MINUTES PAST ANYTHING AND TRAVELED IN COMPANY THE REST OF THE WAY HOME
EVEN THE LIGHTNING COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THEIR ANXIETIES
THE RELIEF DID NOT COME
I CAN'T RECALL THOSE NAMES SOMEHOW
ORDER
ORDER
ORDER
SELLERS HAD RETURNED HOME CHEERFUL BUT EMPTY-HANDED AND THE MULE BUSINESS LAPSED INTO OTHER HANDS
PHILLIP AND HARRY REACHED NEW YORK IN VERY DIFFERENT STATES OF MIND
WORSE THAN THAT
IF HE RETURNED WITH A FORTUNE PERHAPS AND PERHAPS
I'VE READ OF CASES
I'VE GOT A FRIEND IN THERE--I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN SIR BY THE NEXT DAY SOMETHING MORE OF LAURA'S OWN STORY BEGAN TO APPEAR IN THE NEWSPAPERS COLORED AND HEIGHTENED BY REPORTERS RHETORIC
A BETTER DAY IS--IS COMING
WHAT DO THEY SAY SOME SAY THAT YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEAD ABOUT HIM
AND YOU KNOW I DO DREAD DYSPEPSIA
NOW YOUR GENERAL GLANCE GIVES YOU PICTURESQUE STRETCHES OF GLEAMING WATER ON YOUR LEFT WITH A SAIL HERE AND THERE AND A LUNATIC ASYLUM ON SHORE
SIGNED WASHINGTON FOR A MOMENT THE WORDS SWAM BEFORE HER EYES
AND HE NEVER DREAMED THAT SUCH A JOYFUL LETTER COULD SADDEN HER AND FILL HER NIGHT WITH SIGHS AND TROUBLED THOUGHTS AND BODINGS OF THE FUTURE INSTEAD OF FILLING IT WITH PEACE AND BLESSING IT WITH RESTFUL SLEEP
AN DEAH LORD GOOD LORD IT AIN'T LIKE YO MERCY IT AIN'T LIKE YO PITY IT AIN'T LIKE YO LONG-SUFFERIN LOVIN KINDNESS FOR TO TAKE DIS KIND O VANTAGE O SICK LITTLE CHIL'EN AS DOSE IS WHEN DEY'S SO MANY ORNERY GROWN FOLKS CHUCK FULL O CUSSEDNESS DAT WANTS ROASTIN DOWN DAH
WE WORK IN HARNESS AND ARE VERY LOVING--I DO EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN FOR HIM THERE
THE VERDICT OF THE JURY HAVING LEFT NO DOUBT THAT THE WOMAN WAS OF AN UNSOUND MIND WITH A KIND OF INSANITY DANGEROUS TO THE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY SHE COULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO GO AT LARGE
AND MR BOLTON HAD THE GRACE TO GIVE HIM LIKE ADVICE
THESE NEIGHBORS HAD JUST FINISHED DISPOSING THE BODY OF A WOMAN IN IT--A WOMAN WITH A CAREWORN GENTLE FACE THAT HAD MORE THE LOOK OF SLEEP ABOUT IT THAN OF DEATH
IF HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN AN OFFICIAL POSITION OUT OF THE HIGHEST HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EMBARRASSED IN THE SELECTION
THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY OF COURSE HE IS BUSY WITH SOME GENTLEMEN SIR
THE COLONEL DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO TURN NOR WHAT TO DO
WELL YOU MAY OPEN YOUR EYES AND STARE
SHE CAUGHT SUCH REMARKS AS WHO IS SHE SUPERB WOMAN THAT IS THE NEW BEAUTY FROM THE WEST ETC ETC
THE COUNTRY ABOUT WAS THE PERFECTION OF CULTIVATED LANDSCAPE DOTTED WITH COTTAGES AND STATELY MANSIONS OF REVOLUTIONARY DATE AND SWEET AS AN ENGLISH COUNTRY-SIDE WHETHER SEEN IN THE SOFT BLOOM OF MAY OR IN THE MELLOW RIPENESS OF LATE OCTOBER
AND EVERYBODY HAS EM
MR HAWKINS CAME INTO THEIR PRESENCE AND STOOD WITHOUT SPEAKING
IT WAS A SMALL ROOM WITH A STOVE IN THE MIDDLE SET IN A LONG SHALLOW BOX OF SAND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SPITTERS A BAR ACROSS ONE END--A MERE COUNTER WITH A SLIDING GLASS-CASE BEHIND IT CONTAINING A FEW BOTTLES HAVING AMBITIOUS LABELS AND A WASH-SINK IN ONE CORNER
CALL THE MATE
IN A FREE COUNTRY LIKES OURS WHERE ANY MAN CAN RUN FOR CONGRESS AND ANYBODY CAN VOTE FOR HIM YOU CAN'T EXPECT IMMORTAL PURITY ALL THE TIME--IT AIN'T IN NATURE
THEN BURIED IT UNDER A MAZE OF OBLITERATING LINES
THE POOR YOUTH BLUSHED AND FELT AS IF HE MUST DIE WITH SHAME
BUT CUSTOM AND THE FIXED ORDER ARE STRONGER THAN THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC AND REBELLIOUS YOUNG LADY AS RUTH VERY SOON FOUND
I'LL LEAVE MY CHILDREN NO TENNESSEE LAND SPOKEN LIKE A MAN SIR SPOKEN LIKE A MAN
BUT IF A WOMAN LOOKED AT ME AS I'VE SEEN HER AT SELBY I SHOULD UNDERSTAND IT
AND SHE DOUBTED NOT THAT THE ONES SHE HAD FERRETED OUT WOULD HAVE SHARED THE SAME FATE IF MR HAWKINS HAD NOT BEEN A DREAMER VOID OF METHOD WHOSE MIND WAS PERHAPS IN A STATE OF CONFLAGRATION OVER SOME BRIGHT NEW SPECULATION WHEN HE RECEIVED THEM
HE GOT THE USUAL AMOUNT OF SUSPENSION
HOWEVER PERHAPS HE WAS MERELY ENGAGED IN UPHOLDING THE ANCIENT DIGNITY OF THE SENATE,'--THEN NO THE MODERN DIGNITY OF IT SAID ANOTHER BY-STANDER
I SHOULD HAVE KILLED HIM IF I COULD
ONCE OR TWICE I HAVE TRAVELED IN THE CARS--AND THERE YOU KNOW THE PEANUT BOY ALWAYS MEASURES YOU WITH HIS EYE AND HANDS YOU OUT A BOOK OF MURDERS IF YOU ARE FOND OF THEOLOGY
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WASHINGTON WAS NOT ABLE TO IGNORE THE COLD ENTIRELY
AS THE OBEDSTOWN FOLK SAY ABOUT THEIR HOGS A SMALLER STEAMBOAT RECEIVED THE HAWKINSES AND THEIR FORTUNES AND BORE THEM A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILES STILL HIGHER UP THE MISSISSIPPI AND LANDED THEM AT A LITTLE TUMBLE-DOWN VILLAGE ON THE MISSOURI SHORE IN THE TWILIGHT OF A MELLOW OCTOBER DAY
THAT IS WHAT THE BOYS SAY
MRS BOLTON HAD BEEN CAUTIOUS IN WHAT SHE SAID BUT PHILIP INFERRED EVERYTHING FROM HER REPLY TO HIS OWN QUESTIONS ONE DAY HAS THEE EVER SPOKEN THY MIND TO RUTH WHY SHOULDN'T HE SPEAK HIS MIND AND END HIS DOUBTS
AT A CERTAIN GREEN AGE YOUNG GENTLEMEN ARE SOMETIMES AFRAID OF BEING CALLED MILKSOPS AND PHILIP'S ASSOCIATES HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN THE MOST SELECT SUCH AS THESE HISTORIANS WOULD HAVE CHOSEN FOR HIM OR WHOM AT A LATER PERIOD HE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN FOR HIMSELF
MR BIGLER WENT ON AND GAVE SOME VERY INTERESTING DETAILS OF THE INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN RAILROADS AND POLITICS AND THOROUGHLY ENTERTAINED HIMSELF ALL DINNER TIME AND AS MUCH DISGUSTED RUTH WHO ASKED NO MORE QUESTIONS AND HER FATHER WHO REPLIED IN MONOSYLLABLES
I HAD FORGOTTEN
BUT HE IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS
THESE ARE THE EARLY MALCOLM--IT'S A TURNIP THAT CAN'T BE PRODUCED EXCEPT IN JUST ONE ORCHARD AND THE SUPPLY NEVER IS UP TO THE DEMAND
WELL YOU OUGHT NOT TO GO INTO THE DOME ANYHOW BECAUSE IT WOULD BE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GO UP THERE WITHOUT SEEING THE FRESCOES IN IT--AND WHY SHOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN THE DELIRIUM TREMENS OF ART
THE COUNTRY REQUIRES IT THEN THE COUNTRY IS A FOOL I THINK OH NO
WELL WELL WELL IT DOES SEEM MOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE I DECLARE
HE EXAMINED THE TABLE WAITER AS TO WHETHER COL
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE TELEGRAPH BOY TO COME ALL THE WAY UP HERE
TELL ME--HOW DID YOU GET HOLD OF THAT PAGE OF MANUSCRIPT
I WROTE YOUR SPEECH MYSELF AND YOU READ IT FROM MY MANUSCRIPT
I SUPPOSE I MUST VOTE FOR THAT BILL IN THE END MAYBE
AND THE REFRAIN EVEN SANG ITSELF OVER IN RUTH'S HEART AS SHE WENT THE WEARY HOSPITAL ROUNDS
I JUST REMINDED HIM OF IT IN A QUIET WAY AND ITS FINAL RESULT AND HE SAID IN A WHISPER YOU DID IT COLONEL YOU DID IT SIR--BUT KEEP IT MUM FOR MY SAKE
SHE DID NOT AT ANY RATE GIVE PHILIP TOO MUCH ENCOURAGEMENT
I HAVEN'T EXACTLY PROMISED YET--THERE'S NO HURRY--THE MORE INDIFFERENT I SEEM YOU KNOW THE MORE ANXIOUS THOSE FELLOWS WILL GET
PERHAPS HE THOUGHT AS HE HAD SAVED ONE SISTER THE OTHER OUGHT TO HELP HIM WHEN HE WAS IN TROUBLE
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT OF JOHNSON
PETROLEUM WAS THE AGENT THAT HAD SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED THE GASHLYS FROM MODEST HARD-WORKING COUNTRY VILLAGE FOLK INTO LOUD ARISTOCRATS AND ORNAMENTS OF THE CITY
SHE GREW VERY MISERABLE
EVEN WHILE HE WAS FLYING TO HER HER GENTLE SPIRIT MIGHT HAVE GONE ON ANOTHER FLIGHT WHITHER HE COULD NOT FOLLOW HER
SOCIETY HAD PURSUED HER FATE HAD PURSUED HER AND IN A MOMENT OF DELIRIUM SHE HAD TURNED AND DEFIED FATE AND SOCIETY
SHE HAD A DIM FEELING OF THIS AND SHE WOULD LIKE NOW TO STAND WELL WITH HIM
WHERE DID YOU GET IT
I THINK WE OUGHT ALL TO SHARE OUR PLEASURES WITH OTHERS AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE EACH OTHER HAPPY DO NOT YOU OH YES
SOMETIMES SHE CLOSED IN UNDER A POINT WHERE THE DEAD WATER AND THE HELPING EDDIES WERE AND SHAVED THE BANK SO CLOSELY THAT THE DECKS WERE SWEPT BY THE JUNGLE OF OVER-HANGING WILLOWS AND LITTERED WITH A SPOIL OF LEAVES
IF I FEEL LONELY AT TIMES BECAUSE OF MY EXILE FROM OLD FRIENDS ALTHOUGH SURROUNDED BY NEW ONES WHO ARE ALREADY VERY DEAR TO ME HOW MUCH MORE LONELY MUST YOU FEEL BEREFT AS YOU ARE AND WITH NO WHOLESOME RELIEF FROM THE CARES OF STATE THAT WEIGH YOU DOWN
THIRTY THOUSAND--ASS THAT I AM
AND FINALLY THEY ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN PARIS THAT PARADISE OF AMERICANS OF THEIR SORT.--THEY STAID THERE TWO YEARS AND LEARNED TO SPEAK ENGLISH WITH A FOREIGN ACCENT--NOT THAT IT HADN'T ALWAYS HAD A FOREIGN ACCENT WHICH WAS INDEED THE CASE BUT NOW THE NATURE OF IT WAS CHANGED
SHE WAS IN WASHINGTON SOLELY TO COMPASS A CERTAIN MATTER AND TO DO IT AT ANY COST AND THESE PEOPLE MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HER WHILE IT WAS PLAIN THAT HER PURPOSES AND HER SCHEMES FOR PUSHING THEM WOULD NOT FIND FAVOR IN THE EYES OF THE ANTIQUES
BEARING WASHINGTON HAWKINS AND HIS FORTUNES THE STAGE-COACH TORE OUT OF SWANSEA AT A FEARFUL GAIT WITH HORN TOOTING GAILY AND HALF THE TOWN ADMIRING FROM DOORS AND WINDOWS
YES SIR TOMORROW IT WILL BE GENERAL LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU SIR
I SHOWED HIM IT WAS TOO CRUMBLY
I COULD NOT RID MYSELF OF HIM THOUGH MY TIME WAS VERY PRECIOUS
CHAPTER XVIII
NOTHING LIKE A SON-IN-LAW HERE IN WASHINGTON OR A BROTHER-IN-LAW
THERE ARE LITTLE PROPRIETIES THAT ARE BEST PRESERVED
THERE'S FORTUNES UPON FORTUNES OF COPPER ORE ON OUR LAND
AND HE DID NOT NEED LAURA'S REBUKE WHEN HE HEARD HIS FATHER SAY
MR HARRY BRIERLY DREW HIS PAY AS AN ENGINEER WHILE HE WAS LIVING AT THE CITY HOTEL IN HAWKEYE
ILIUM WAS THE RAILWAY STATION NEAREST TO THE TRACT OF WILD LAND WHICH MR BOLTON HAD COMMISSIONED HIM TO EXAMINE
IT IS ALWAYS THE GENTLE SEX WHICH IS HARD AND CRUEL AND FICKLE AND IMPLACABLE
YOU CAN BE SOCIABLE EASILY ENOUGH IF YOU HAVE A MIND TO
IT WOULD MORTIFY MOTHER DREADFULLY TO HAVE ME DRIVING ABOUT PHILADELPHIA IN A DOCTOR'S GIG PHILIP LAUGHED AT THE IDEA OF IT
THERE WAS NO CARPET ON THE FLOOR
YOU DON'T KNOW I'D RATHER HAVE KILLED HIM MYSELF IN A DUEL YOU KNOW ALL FAIR
AND HER FACE WAS LIVID
IT WAS AN INGENIOUS THING AND IT HAD A GENUINE TOUCH OF HUMOR ABOUT IT TOO
SHE CAUGHT AT THAT--AND IT GAVE A NEW CURRENT TO HER THOUGHTS
DOES I RECKON
THE PARENTS HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE THE EXPLOSION
ABOVE ALL THINGS BE PURE-MINDED AS THE SNOW
THAR AIN'T NO COLUMBUS THOUT'N IT'S OVER TO HAWKEYE INTERRUPTED ONE OF THE CITIZENS WHO HAD COME OUT TO STARE AT THE STRANGERS
THE PRAIRIE WITH ITS NEW GRASS AND UNENDING ACRES OF BRILLIANT FLOWERS--CHIEFLY THE INNUMERABLE VARIETIES OF PHLOX--BORE THE LOOK OF YEARS OF CULTIVATION AND THE OCCASIONAL OPEN GROVES OF WHITE OAKS GAVE IT A PARK-LIKE APPEARANCE
IT'S GOING TO BE THE GREAT THING BUT WE'D BETTER KEEP THIS APPROPRIATION GOING WHILE I AM PERFECTING IT HARRY TOOK LETTERS TO SEVERAL CONGRESSMEN FROM HIS UNCLE AND FROM MR DUFF BROWN EACH OF WHOM HAD AN EXTENSIVE ACQUAINTANCE IN BOTH HOUSES WHERE THEY WERE WELL KNOWN AS MEN ENGAGED IN LARGE PRIVATE OPERATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD AND MEN BESIDES WHO IN THE SLANG OF THE DAY UNDERSTOOD THE VIRTUES OF ADDITION DIVISION AND SILENCE SENATOR DILWORTHY INTRODUCED THE PETITION INTO THE SENATE WITH THE REMARK THAT HE KNEW PERSONALLY THE SIGNERS OF IT THAT THEY WERE MEN INTERESTED IT WAS TRUE IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE COUNTRY BUT HE BELIEVED WITHOUT ANY SELFISH MOTIVE AND THAT SO FAR AS HE KNEW THE SIGNERS WERE LOYAL
COAL
ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE IN THE NEXT CONGRESS
THE YOUNG MEN WERE RECEIVED AT THE HOUSE OF THE MONTAGUES WITH THE HOSPITALITY WHICH NEVER FAILED THERE
SHE RAISED HERSELF UP WITH DIFFICULTY FOR THE AIR WAS CHILLY AND HER LIMBS WERE STIFF
MY REPUTATION IS GETTING A LITTLE DAMAGED AND I MEANT TO CLEAR IT UP BRILLIANTLY WITH AN EXPOSURE OF THIS BILL AT THE SUPREME MOMENT AND RIDE BACK INTO CONGRESS ON THE ECLAT OF IT
PHILIP IN LUCK HAD BECOME SUDDENLY A PERSON OF CONSIDERATION WHOSE SPEECH WAS FREIGHTED WITH MEANING WHOSE LOOKS WERE ALL SIGNIFICANT
WASHINGTON APPEARED TO BE THE NATIVE ELEMENT OF THIS MAN
DON'T MENTION ME IN THE MATTER AT ALL WASHINGTON ALL RIGHT--I WON'T
AND COAL OR NO COAL I WILL DRIVE THE TUNNEL CLEAR THROUGH THE HILL
IT WILL BE COMING RIGHT ALONG AND THE RAILROAD SWIMMING RIGHT ALONG BEHIND IT
HE SPENT MANY HOURS IN TALKING IT OVER WITH THE SENATOR AFTER DINNER
HE TOLD HARRY ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY OF THE CONVERSATION--SHE WAS BENT ON GOING HER OWN WAY HE HAD NOT THE GHOST OF A CHANCE--HE WAS A FOOL SHE HAD SAID FOR THINKING HE HAD
SUPPOSE PEOPLE CAME AROUND PITYING ME--ODIOUS
HOW I HATE HIM
SHE'S PURE DEVIL THAT GIRL
WITH ALL HER PRETTY GIRLISH AIRS AND GRACES IN FULL PLAY AND THAT SWEET IGNORANCE OF CARE AND THAT ATMOSPHERE OF INNOCENCE AND PURITY ALL ABOUT HER THAT BELONG TO HER GRACIOUS TIME OF LIFE INDEED SHE WAS A VISION TO WARM THE COLDEST HEART AND BLESS AND CHEER THE SADDEST
IF HENRY BRIERLY HAD BEEN BLOWN UP ON THE FIRST MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOAT HE SET FOOT ON AS THE CHANCES WERE THAT HE WOULD BE HE AND COL
AND HE WISHED THAT SHE COULD SEE HIS SUFFERINGS NOW
MERELY HEART DISEASE
LET ME SEE--HAVE I STATED ALL THE EXPENSES I'VE BEEN AT
I TRIED A HAND MYSELF BUT THOSE OLD FELLOWS ARE TOO MANY FOR ME
WHEN IT'S IMPROVED STEAMBOATS WILL RUN RIGHT UP HERE
IT'S WHO ASKED WASHINGTON WHEN THEY HAD GAINED THE CARRIAGE
WHAT SHOULD YOU SAY IT WAS CHILDREN
IF HE WON'T STICK TO ANY INDUSTRY EXCEPT FOR HIMSELF NOW WHAT WILL HE DO THEN BUT COLONEL THE NEGRO WHEN EDUCATED WILL BE MORE ABLE TO MAKE HIS SPECULATIONS FRUITFUL NEVER SIR NEVER
HE HAD OTHER REASONS ALSO
GREAT INJUN PACIFICATOR AND LAND DEALER
NANCY THERE'S OCEANS AND OCEANS OF MONEY IN THAT LAND--MARK MY WORDS THE CHILDREN HAD STOPPED PLAYING FOR THE MOMENT AND DRAWN NEAR TO LISTEN
HE GOT HIM UP AND SUPPORTED HIM--ALMOST CARRIED HIM INDEED--OUT OF THE BUILDING AND INTO A CARRIAGE
THE DRESSES OF BOTH LADIES WERE EXCEEDINGLY RICH AS TO MATERIAL BUT AS NOTABLY MODEST AS TO COLOR AND ORNAMENT
HE AND I ARE SWORN BROTHERS ON THAT MEASURE
MR STERLING WHEN TIM WAS DOWN A WEEK WITH HIS FALL YOU KEPT HIM ON HALF-WAGES AND IT WAS A MIGHTY HELP TO HIS FAMILY
I HAVE COME SAID PHILIP IN HIS DIRECT MANNER FROM MY FRIEND MR BRIERLY
WHEN THE BOREAS HAD JOURNEYED SOME FOUR HUNDRED MILES FROM THE TIME THE HAWKINSES JOINED HER A LONG RANK OF STEAMBOATS WAS SIGHTED PACKED SIDE BY SIDE AT A WHARF LIKE SARDINES IN A BOX AND ABOVE AND BEYOND THEM ROSE THE DOMES AND STEEPLES AND GENERAL ARCHITECTURAL CONFUSION OF A CITY--A CITY WITH AN IMPOSING UMBRELLA OF BLACK SMOKE SPREAD OVER IT
A WEEK AFTER THIS HE WAS SITTING IN A DOUBLE-BEDDED ROOM IN A CHEAP BOARDING HOUSE IN WASHINGTON WITH COL
THEN HE STOPPED AND STUDIED LAURA'S FACE A WHILE AND ENDED BY SAYING
SELBY HAD JUST COME TO WASHINGTON AND TAKEN LODGINGS IN GEORGETOWN
I SAY THIS ON YOUR ACCOUNT NOT HIS
WE BEG THE READER'S PARDON
IT IS MY FIRST VISIT
AND HE CONSIDERED THAT IN TRIFLING WITH HIS CASE AND SHIRKING IT THE SENATE WAS DOING A SHAMEFUL AND COWARDLY THING--A THING WHICH SUGGESTED THAT IN ITS WILLINGNESS TO SIT LONGER IN THE COMPANY OF SUCH A MAN IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IT WAS ITSELF OF A KIND WITH HIM AND WAS THEREFORE NOT DISHONORED BY HIS PRESENCE
IT IS JUST WHAT WE WANT
HE'S GOING TO RUN A TUNNEL INTO IT IN THE SPRING DOES HE WANT ANY CAPITAL ASKED THE COLONEL IN THE TONE OF A MAN WHO IS GIVEN TO CALCULATING CAREFULLY BEFORE HE MAKES AN INVESTMENT
IT SEEMED TO THEM A MIGHTY FREE AND HOSPITABLE TOWN
WASHINGTON NEVER HEARD ANY NOISE OF ANY KIND AFTER HIS EYES WERE SHUT
SHE SHOULD PRAY FOR HIS SUCCESS AT ANY RATE AND ESPECIALLY THAT THE INDIANS IN ST LOUIS WOULD NOT TAKE HIS SCALP
ELEVEN POOR CREATURES LAY DEAD AND FORTY MORE LAY MOANING OR PLEADING OR SCREAMING WHILE A SCORE OF GOOD SAMARITANS MOVED AMONG THEM DOING WHAT THEY COULD TO RELIEVE THEIR SUFFERINGS
LORD BLESS YOU IT IS NOTHING BUT A BARREN HIGHWAY THAT YOU'VE GOT TO CROSS TO GET TO THE TRUE EYE-WATER MARKET
ASSESSMENT
I DON'T INTEND TO SPARE ANY EXPENSE
AND HE KNEW THAT NO COUNTRY CAN BE WELL GOVERNED UNLESS ITS CITIZENS AS A BODY KEEP RELIGIOUSLY BEFORE THEIR MINDS THAT THEY ARE THE GUARDIANS OF THE LAW AND THAT THE LAW OFFICERS ARE ONLY THE MACHINERY FOR ITS EXECUTION NOTHING MORE
HE SOFTLY SAID
FIRST WE THOUGHT HE MUST BE INJURED INTERNALLY
AS THEIR EXCITEMENT ROSE THEIR VOICES WENT DOWN
YOU'VE HEARD THESE CATTLE HERE SCOFF AT THEM AND CALL THEM LIES AND HUMBUGS,--BUT THEY'RE NOT LIES AND HUMBUGS THEY'RE A REALITY AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE A MORE WONDERFUL THING SOME DAY THAN THEY ARE NOW
YOU SEE MISS HAWKINS THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY
IT'S BORN WITH THEM IT STAYS WITH THEM IT'S ALL THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE LEFT WHEN THEY DIE
THEY WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON A BENCH BEFORE A COUNTRY TAVERN IN THE FREE CONVERSE PERMITTED BY OUR DEMOCRATIC HABITS
IT IS A TIME WHEN ONE'S SPIRIT IS SUBDUED AND SAD ONE KNOWS NOT WHY
IT'S A BOOK THAT I CAN RECOMMEND--'THE PIRATE'S DOOM OR THE LAST OF THE BUCCANEERS I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT'S COME OUT THIS SEASON LAURA PUSHED IT GENTLY ASIDE WITH HER HAND AND WENT ON AND WENT ON FILCHING FROM VENETIAN LIFE I BELIEVE I DO NOT WANT IT SHE SAID
SOMETIMES SHE STOPPED A MOMENT AT A LANDING AND TOOK ON SOME FREIGHT OR A PASSENGER WHILE A CROWD OF SLOUCHY WHITE MEN AND NEGROES STOOD ON THE BANK AND LOOKED SLEEPILY ON WITH THEIR HANDS IN THEIR PANTALOONS POCKETS,--OF COURSE--FOR THEY NEVER TOOK THEM OUT EXCEPT TO STRETCH AND WHEN THEY DID THIS THEY SQUIRMED ABOUT AND REACHED THEIR FISTS UP INTO THE AIR AND LIFTED THEMSELVES ON TIP-TOE IN AN ECSTASY OF ENJOYMENT
WELL LET IT BE LET IT
WHILE THE ENGINEER CORPS WENT TO THE FIELD TO RUN BACK A COUPLE OF MILES AND ASCERTAIN APPROXIMATELY IF A ROAD COULD EVER GET DOWN TO THE LANDING AND TO SIGHT AHEAD ACROSS THE RUN AND SEE IF IT COULD EVER GET OUT AGAIN COL
TROLLOP THINKS IT OVER 144.  DILWORTHY GIVES LAURA HIS BLESSING 145.  UNNECESSARY PRECAUTION 146.  WHERE THE PROTECTION IS NEEDED 147.  AN OBJECT OF SYMPATHY 148.  CHILDREN OF HOPE 149.  THE EDITOR 150.  PHILIP LEAVING LAURA 151.  CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE 152.  THE HOUSE 153.  COL SELLERS ASLEEP IN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 154.  A HEARTY SHAKE CHAPTER XXXVII
AT NIGHT THE BOAT FORGED ON THROUGH THE DEEP SOLITUDES OF THE RIVER HARDLY EVER DISCOVERING A LIGHT TO TESTIFY TO A HUMAN PRESENCE--MILE AFTER MILE AND LEAGUE AFTER LEAGUE THE VAST BENDS WERE GUARDED BY UNBROKEN WALLS OF FOREST THAT HAD NEVER BEEN DISTURBED BY THE VOICE OR THE FOOT-FALL OF MAN OR FELT THE EDGE OF HIS SACRILEGIOUS AXE
ONLY A LITTLE
HE WAS A SMALL MAN SLOVENLY IN DRESS HIS TONE CONFIDENTIAL HIS MANNER WHOLLY VOID OF ANIMATION ALL HIS FEATURES BELOW THE FOREHEAD PROTRUDING--PARTICULARLY THE APPLE OF HIS THROAT--HAIR WITHOUT A KINK IN IT A HAND WITH NO GRIP A MEEK HANG-DOG COUNTENANCE
HE ASSEMBLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AT THE CITY OF SAINT'S REST THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE ALONG WITH HIS BROTHER LEGISLATORS
AT THE END OF SOME WEEKS HARRY'S ORDERS WERE A DRUG IN THE MARKET--NOBODY WOULD TAKE THEM AT ANY DISCOUNT WHATEVER
CLOSING SENTENCE
FOR HOGS GREAT AND SMALL ROOTED ABOUT IN IT AND WALLOWED IN IT TURNING THE STREET INTO A LIQUID QUAGMIRE WHICH COULD ONLY BE CROSSED ON PIECES OF PLANK THROWN HERE AND THERE
I MEANT NOTHING BALLOON TALKS A LITTLE FREELY SOMETIMES WITH MEN
GENTLEMEN THE LIFE OF THIS LOVELY AND ONCE HAPPY GIRL THIS NOW STRICKEN WOMAN IS IN YOUR HANDS THE JURY WERE VISIBLY AFFECTED
CONGRESS WAS EXPIRING AND WAS PASSING BILL AFTER BILL AS IF THEY WERE GASPS AND EACH LIKELY TO BE ITS LAST
THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT HIS GETTING ALL THE MONEY HE WANTED
AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN INTENTNESS AND FIERCE ENERGY IN WHAT SHE DID THAT MIGHT HAVE REVEALED SOMETHING TO PHILIP IF HE HAD BEEN IN HIS SENSES
HE THINKS WOMEN WON'T HOLD OUT LONG ADDED RUTH WITH THE SMILE THAT PHILIP NEVER EXACTLY UNDERSTOOD
WE MUST LOSE YOU ALSO FOR A LITTLE WHILE MY BOY
IT'S NO PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN THEY'VE NO IDEA HOW TO TREAT A GENTLEMAN
IT IS WINTER AND NIGHT
ALAS I CANNOT TELL YOU
YOU CAN GO TO BED AND SLEEP EASY ON THAT AFTER MR NOBLE WAS GONE THE SENATOR SAID
IT WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE HAD CHAMPIONS WHO THOUGHT THAT HER WRONGS OUGHT TO BE PLACED AGAINST HER CRIME AND EXPRESSIONS OF THIS FEELING CAME TO HER IN VARIOUS WAYS
AND THERE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS AND LITTLE SOUVENIRS HERE AND THERE OF FOREIGN TRAVEL
ALL THE PARTIES HAD BEEN INTERVIEWED THERE WERE REPORTS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CLERK AT THE HOTEL
GIVE THE BOYS THIRTY-DAY ORDERS ON THE COMPANY FOR THE BACK PAY THAT'S IT-THAT'S MY OWN IDEA TO A DOT
THE DAY HAD BEEN SPENT BY PHILIP IN NO LESS EXCITEMENT
THE CHAIRMAN SAID IT WAS THE QUICKEST WAY TO PROCEED AND THE EVIDENCE NEED HAVE NO WEIGHT
THE SENATOR FROWNED AND SAID HE DID NOT LIKE TO HEAR THAT KIND OF NEWSPAPER SLANG
BUT I DO NOT ASK MERCY OF YOU WHO ARE THE GUARDIANS OF SOCIETY AND OF THE POOR WAIFS ITS SOMETIMES WRONGED VICTIMS
NOW WHAT CAN THE GIRL MEAN
ALL THAT HE IS HE OWES TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
HE HAD FOUND PARADISE AT LAST
THEE IS WANDERING AGAIN AND RUTH CLOSED HIS LIPS WITH A SMILE ON HER OWN THAT BROADENED INTO A MERRY LAUGH AS SHE RAN AWAY
OH YES WE ARE OLD FRIENDS
WILL THERE NOT ALWAYS BE ROSIN ENOUGH FOR THE SQUEAKING FIDDLE-BOW
THEY COULD NOT HELP IT SEEING HOW SHE CLUNG TO THEM AND PUT HER ARMS ABOUT THEIR NECKS AND FOUND NO SOLACE BUT IN THEIR KIND EYES AND COMFORTING WORDS
THE SENATOR THOUGHT NOT
MY HEART IS HERE
THIS VERY BLAST MIGHT DISCLOSE THE TREASURE
HE DREW HIS CURTAIN FROM TIME TO TIME AND LOOKED OUT
WHAT EVER TO SAY BE TOKE IN HIS ENTENTE HIS LANGAGE WAS SO FAYER PERTYNANTE YT SEMETH UNTO MANYS HERYING NOT ONLY THE WORDE BUT VERYLY THE THYNG
SHE HAD NOTICED BEFORE THE SIGNS OF A CHANGE IN MANNER TOWARDS HER A LITTLE LESS RESPECT PERHAPS FROM MEN AND AN AVOIDANCE BY WOMEN
HIT'S WHAT HE CALLS IT
IT WAS THE PASSION OF HER LIFE THE TIME WHEN HER WHOLE NATURE WENT TO FLOOD TIDE AND SWEPT AWAY ALL BARRIERS
THE COURT WOULD SOON SIT TO TRY HER CASE HE SAID AND CONSEQUENTLY A GREAT DEAL OF READY MONEY WOULD BE NEEDED IN THE ENGINEERING OF IT
SHE SAT LONG WITH THE LETTERS IN HER LAP THINKING--AND UNCONSCIOUSLY FREEZING
194.  COL
AND LAURA WOULD NOT BE LYING IN THE TOMBS AWAITING HER TRIAL FOR MURDER AND DOING HER BEST BY THE HELP OF ABLE COUNSEL TO CORRUPT THE PURE FOUNTAIN OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IN NEW YORK
HE HAD ONLY BEEN AMUSING HIMSELF WITH SELLERS SCHEMES
HER SPIRIT WAS ROUSED HER AMBITION WAS TOWERING NOW
NOW JUST THINK FOR A MOMENT--JUST FIGURE UP A LITTLE ON THE FUTURE DEAD MORAL CERTAINTIES
SOMETIMES AT A DINNER PARTY OR A RECEPTION HE WOULD FIND HIMSELF THE CENTRE OF INTEREST AND FEEL UNUTTERABLY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE DISCOVERY
AND HOW I REPENT ME THAT THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN I LOST FAITH AND SAID THE BLESSING HE STORED UP FOR US A TEDIOUS GENERATION AGO WAS BUT A LONG-DRAWN CURSE A BLIGHT UPON US ALL
THE ESCAPE-PIPES BELCHED SNOWY PILLARS OF STEAM ALOFT THE BOAT GROUND AND SURGED AND TREMBLED--AND SLID OVER INTO M-A-R-K TWAIN QUARTER-HER TAP
LET'S GO THEY WERE TURNING TO SAY GOOD-BY TO THE HOSTESS WHEN LAURA'S ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY THE SIGHT OF A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS JUST SPEAKING TO MRS SCHOONMAKER
WELL I SAW THAT THE ACADEMY OF FRANCE HAD BEEN TESTING THE PROPERTIES OF HEAT AND THEY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS A NONCONDUCTOR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND OF COURSE ITS INFLUENCE MUST NECESSARILY BE DEADLY IN NERVOUS ORGANIZATIONS WITH EXCITABLE TEMPERAMENTS ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE IS ANY TENDENCY TOWARD RHEUMATIC AFFECTIONS
HE ADDED THAT HE NEVER SAW SUCH A SCOUNDREL AS SELBY
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS
AS SOON AS HE RETURNS THE LETTER THAT BORE THE LATEST DATE OF ALL CONTAINED THIS CLAUSE
HIS ATTENTIONS TO HER TROUBLED HER FATHER AND MOTHER A LITTLE AND THEY WARNED LOUISE WITHOUT STATING PARTICULARS OR MAKING ALLUSIONS TO ANY SPECIAL PERSON THAT A GIRL WAS SURE TO MAKE A MISTAKE WHO ALLOWED HERSELF TO MARRY ANYBODY BUT A MAN WHO COULD SUPPORT HER WELL
I SHOULD SAY A MILLION
I AM SORRY ENOUGH BERIAH SELLERS IS IN MISSOURI NOW BUT I WAS GLAD WHEN HE WENT
HE ASKED WHAT IT WAS
I'M SADLY BEWILDERED SADLY BEWILDERED
THE ATTORNEY SAT DOWN AND THE CLERK CALLED
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT AT LAST
I FEEL CERTAIN IT IS THERE
WHEN MARGARET TOLD HER HUSBAND OF RUTH'S NEWEST PROJECT HE DID NOT EXHIBIT SO MUCH SURPRISE AS SHE HOPED FOR
AND IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE COULD EVER SAY TO HER WHAT HE HAD COME DETERMINED TO SAY
HOW'S YOUR DRAFT BULLY
HE WAS ALWAYS BRINGING HOME SOMEBODY WHO HAD A SCHEME
SELLERS FOUND THE MOB QUIET ENOUGH WHEN HE REACHED THE LANDING
FOR A UNITED STATES SENATOR WAS A SORT OF GOD IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PEOPLE WHO NEVER HAD SEEN ANY CREATURE MIGHTIER THAN A COUNTY JUDGE
CHAPTER XXVI
AND HE SAID MANY SILLY THINGS BEFORE SHE DISENGAGED HERSELF GENTLY AND LEFT HIM SAYING IT WAS TIME TO DRESS FOR DINNER
AND BRAHAM KNEW IT
I THINK A PRETTY PHYSICIAN WITH ENGAGING MANNERS WOULD COAX A FELLOW TO LIVE THROUGH ALMOST ANYTHING I AM AFRAID YOU ARE A SCOFFER MR BRIERLY ON THE CONTRARY I AM QUITE SINCERE
THEY'LL LIVE LIKE THE PRINCES OF THE EARTH
THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION WAS CLOSED
SELLERS PLANTATION AT HAWKEYE
IF YOU SHOW ME A BOOK WHICH YOU HAVE READ--NOT SKIMMED OVER OR MERELY GLANCED AT BUT READ--AND YOU TELL ME THAT YOU ENJOYED IT AND THAT YOU COULD READ IT THREE OR FOUR TIMES THEN I KNOW WHAT BOOK I WANT THANK YOU!--TH TO AVOID
HERE HE REFERRED TO SOME NOTES FURNISHED HIM BY SENATOR DILWORTHY AND THEN CONTINUED GOD HAD GIVEN US THE CARE OF THESE COLORED MILLIONS
AND THEN WASHINGTON'S HEART WOULD SINK AGAIN AND A SIGH WOULD TELL WHEN IT TOUCHED BOTTOM
A DOZEN GENTLEMEN SPRANG TO THEIR FEET
THE COUGHING GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER THE GLARING EYE GREW LARGER AND STILL LARGER GLARED WILDER AND STILL WILDER
WHO KNOWS RUTH BUT THIS NEW LAND PURCHASE WHICH I CONFESS I YIELDED A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO BIGLER IN MAY NOT TURN OUT A FORTUNE FOR THEE AND THE REST OF THE CHILDREN AH FATHER THEE SEES EVERY THING IN A ROSE-COLORED LIGHT
BUT THE GREETINGS AND CONGRATULATIONS WERE HARDLY FINISHED WHEN ALL THE JOURNALS IN THE LAND CLAMORED THE NEWS OF LAURA'S MISERABLE DEATH
SENATOR DILWORTHY NEVER CAME INTO COLLISION WITH ANY OF THESE FACTIONS
TO NEGLECT IT BEYOND THAT TIME MEANS LET THE MATTER DROP BUT IF SHE DOES RETURN THE VISIT WITHIN TWO WEEKS IT THEN BECOMES THE OTHER PARTY'S PRIVILEGE TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE OR DROP IT
HE PROBABLY COMES FROM WASHINGTON
MR HAWKINS
IF EVER YOU TOOK THE STOCK AT ALL YOU TOOK IT IN OTHER PEOPLE'S NAMES
I AM SURE WE HAVE ACTED IN A PERFECTLY STRAIGHT FORWARD BUSINESS WAY.--NOW LET US LOOK AT THE THING A MOMENT
YOU CAN'T GLORIFY ANY HEARTH STONE BUT MINE IN THIS CAMP YOU KNOW--CAN'T EAT ANYBODY'S BREAD BUT MINE--CAN'T DO ANYTHING BUT JUST MAKE YOURSELVES PERFECTLY AT HOME AND COMFORTABLE AND SPREAD YOURSELVES OUT AND REST
STILL THE SENATOR WAS TRANQUIL FOR HE KNEW THAT THERE IS AN ESPRIT DE CORPS IN THE SENATE WHICH DOES NOT EXIST IN THE HOUSE THE EFFECT OF WHICH IS TO MAKE THE MEMBERS COMPLAISANT TOWARDS THE PROJECTS OF EACH OTHER AND TO EXTEND A MUTUAL AID WHICH IN A MORE VULGAR BODY WOULD BE CALLED LOG-ROLLING IT IS UNDER PROVIDENCE A GOOD NIGHT'S WORK MR STERLING
WE ALL HAVE OUR SHAMS--I SUPPOSE THERE IS A SHAM SOMEWHERE ABOUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL IF WE COULD MANAGE TO FERRET IT OUT
BUT HIS FRIENDS SUFFERED MORE ON HIS ACCOUNT THAN HE DID
THE PORTER RETURNED IN A MINUTE
THAT'S ALL SIR SAID MR BRAHAM SEVERELY
WE HAVE A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING I SUPPOSE THOUGH YOU DON'T SEE MUCH OF THE OLD REBEL ELEMENT SAID LAURA WITH A SMILE
CHAPTER XXIII
AND HOW HIM AND SI DID SIT UP NIGHTS WORKING AT IT WITH THE CURTAINS DOWN AND ME WATCHING TO SEE IF ANY NEIGHBORS WERE ABOUT
LAURA COULD NOT HAVE TREATED HIM WITH MORE LOFTY CONDESCENSION IF SHE HAD BEEN THE QUEEN OF SHEBA ON A ROYAL VISIT TO THE GREAT REPUBLIC
BREAK IT TO FATHER CAUTIOUSLY--YOU UNDERSTAND THE NEED OF THAT--BREAK IT TO HIM CAUTIOUSLY FOR HE HAS HAD SUCH CRUEL HARD FORTUNE AND IS SO STRICKEN BY IT THAT GREAT GOOD NEWS MIGHT PROSTRATE HIM MORE SURELY THAN EVEN BAD FOR HE IS USED TO THE BAD BUT IS GROWN SADLY UNACCUSTOMED TO THE OTHER
HARRY WAS DRESSED AS WE HAVE SEEN HIM ONCE BEFORE AND HIS LONG AND SHINING BOOTS ATTRACTED NOT A LITTLE THE ATTENTION OF THE FEW PERSONS THEY MET ON THE ROAD AND ESPECIALLY OF THE BRIGHT FACED WENCHES WHO LIGHTLY STEPPED ALONG THE HIGHWAY PICTURESQUE IN THEIR COLORED KERCHIEFS CARRYING LIGHT BASKETS OR RIDING UPON MULES AND BALANCING BEFORE THEM A HEAVIER LOAD
IT HAPPENED TO HIM TO BE CAPTURED IN ONE OF HIS SELF-APPOINTED EXPEDITIONS BUT THE FEDERAL COLONEL RELEASED HIM AFTER A SHORT EXAMINATION SATISFIED THAT HE COULD MOST INJURE THE CONFEDERATE FORCES OPPOSED TO THE UNIONISTS BY RETURNING HIM TO HIS REGIMENT
SELLERS AND ANOTHER WITH WASHINGTON HAWKINS THE BROTHER OF THE MURDERESS
IT'S JUST THE SAME THING
BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
THEN CAME JERSEY EVERLASTING JERSEY STUPID IRRITATING JERSEY WHERE THE PASSENGERS ARE ALWAYS ASKING WHICH LINE THEY ARE ON AND WHERE THEY ARE TO COME OUT AND WHETHER THEY HAVE YET REACHED ELIZABETH
IN LAURA'S ROOM THERE WERE THE MARKS OF A CONFUSED AND HASTY DEPARTURE DRAWERS HALF OPEN LITTLE ARTICLES STREWN ON THE FLOOR
OLE DRAKE HIGGINS HE'S BEN DOWN TO SHELBY LAS WEEK
I HAVEN'T GOT OVER GRIEVING FOR THE MONEY THAT COST YET
HE ROSE IN THE MIDST OF THE COLONEL'S TALK AND EXCUSED HIMSELF ON THE PLEA OF A PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT
THEY COST MORE THAN THEY COME TO NOT THE NEXT ONE
BUT THOSE WHOM HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF MEETING OCCASIONALLY FELT ALMOST CERTAIN THAT HE DID KNOW
THE TWO HAD BEEN LIVING TOGETHER LATELY AND THIS MUTUAL CAVERN OF THEIRS THE COLONEL SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THEIR PREMISES AND SOMETIMES AS THEIR APARTMENTS"--MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN CONVERSING WITH PERSONS OUTSIDE
NOW YOU SEE YOU HAD TO KNOW ONE OF TWO THINGS
HIS BOOTS DAINTILY POLISHED AND NO MAN COULD LIFT A FOOT AND FIRE A DEAD SHOT AT A STRAY SPECK OF DIRT ON IT WITH A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF WITH A FINER GRACE THAN HE
LAURA WAS EARLY INSTRUCTED IN THE MYSTERIES OF SOCIETY LIFE BY A COMPETENT MENTOR AND THUS WAS PRESERVED FROM TROUBLESOME MISTAKES
COURTED AS LAURA WAS BY A CERTAIN CLASS AND STILL ADMITTED INTO SOCIETY THAT NEVERTHELESS BUZZED WITH DISREPUTABLE STORIES ABOUT HER SHE HAD LOST CHARACTER WITH THE BEST PEOPLE
WHY THE THING HAS OCCURRED BEFORE NOW
I WANT ALL TO SHARE ALIKE
WISE OLD HEAD
THEY ACT OFFICIALLY
WHAT ARE THEIR OPINIONS TO ME
SO THE NEXT MORNING NEARLY EVERY NEWSPAPER OF CHARACTER IN THE LAND ASSAILED THE MEASURE AND HURLED BROADSIDES OF INVECTIVE AT MR BUCKSTONE
LAURA HAD A PROUD BEARING AND A SOMEWHAT MATURE LOOK
SHE HAD ASKED HIM FOR IT ONE MORNING SAYING SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD HEARD BURGLARS THE NIGHT BEFORE
SHE HAD EXPECTED TO WALK FORTH IN FREEDOM IN A FEW MOMENTS
BY THEIR HELP HE BUILT A LOG HUT AND ESTABLISHED A CAMP ON THE LAND AND THEN BEGAN HIS EXPLORATIONS MAPPING DOWN HIS SURVEY AS HE WENT ALONG NOTING THE TIMBER AND THE LAY OF THE LAND AND MAKING SUPERFICIAL OBSERVATIONS AS TO THE PROSPECT OF COAL
ALL ABOUT THE HOUSE OTHERS SAT IN ALL THE VARIOUS ATTITUDES THAT EXPRESS WEARINESS
THE MEMORIAL CHIMNEY STANDS IN A QUIET PASTORAL LOCALITY THAT IS FULL OF REPOSEFUL EXPRESSION
SHE WAS GREATLY DEPRESSED HOWEVER BY THE NEWS FROM WASHINGTON
I'D MAKE THINGS PLENTY AND BUSINESS LOOK UP THE COLONEL HAD ACCESS TO THE DEPARTMENTS
I HAVE SOME ELEGANT ONES--NOT AS ELEGANT AS YOURS THOUGH--BUT OF COURSE I DON'T WEAR THEM NOW LAURA--"I SUPPOSE THEY ARE RATHER COMMON BUT STILL I HAVE A GREAT AFFECTION FOR THESE BECAUSE THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME BY A DEAR OLD FRIEND OF OUR FAMILY NAMED MURPHY
PLEASE GIVE IT TO ME INDEED I DO NOT WISH TO DISTRESS YOU
HE TRIED TO GET A TRIFLE CLOSER TO THE STOVE AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS HE TRIPPED THE SUPPORTING POKER AND THE STOVE-DOOR TUMBLED TO THE FLOOR
I'M A WISER MAN TO-DAY THAN I WAS YESTERDAY I CAN TELL YOU I THINK YOU ARE
THE LETTER THAT PHILIP STERLING WROTE TO RUTH BOLTON ON THE EVENING OF SETTING OUT TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE IN THE WEST FOUND THAT YOUNG LADY IN HER OWN FATHER'S HOUSE IN PHILADELPHIA
SHE THE GRACIOUS LADY YET NO PAINES DID SPARE TO DOE HIM EASE OR DOE HIM REMEDY
HE LOOKED FROM LAURA TO THE MISERABLE CREATURES WHO WERE WALKING IN THE CORRIDOR WITH UNUTTERABLE DISGUST
52.  "BRESS YOU CHILE YOU DAR NOW 53.  CAMP LIFE 54.  STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER 55.  JEFF THOMPSON AS A NIGHTINGALE 56.  BOUND FOR STONE'S LANDING 57.  STONE'S LANDING 58.  WAITING FOR A RAILROAD 59.  "IT AIN'T THERE 60.  TAIL PIECE 61.  CAPTURE OF WASHINGTON 63.  LAURA SWOONED 62.  TAILPIECE CHAPTER X
I SUPPOSE NOW THAT YOU WOULD ALL CHOOSE TO HAVE ME STAY IDLY AT HOME AND GIVE UP MY PROFESSION OH NO SAID PHILIP EARNESTLY I RESPECT YOUR RESOLUTION
PHILIP HIMSELF HASTENED TO PHILADELPHIA AND AS SOON AS THE SPRING OPENED TO THE MINE AT ILIUM AND BEGAN TRANSFORMING THE LOAN HE HAD RECEIVED FROM SQUIRE MONTAGUE INTO LABORERS WAGES
AND YET I LOVED HIM
HER CHEEKS WERE FLUSHED WITH FEVER AND SHE MOVED HER HEAD RESTLESSLY AS IF IN PAIN
IT'S HARD TO BURN UP IN A COOP LIKE THIS WITH THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD SO NEAR
IT DOES NOT CONCERN ME
THE FOUNDATION OF MODERN SOCIETY
I'LL RISK ANYTHING HE IS SUFFERING TO TAKE IT NOW
OLE MAM HIGGINS SHE TOLE ME
I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN SO HEEDLESS--I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ASKED YOU BUT YOU DIDN'T ASK ME MA'M
WHAT QUALITY IS IT WERE SOME OF THE RAPID QUESTIONS THAT PHILIP POURED OUT AS HE HURRIEDLY DRESSED
I'LL SHOOST--PUT ON MY TROWSERS SHOUTED A VOICE FROM THE WINDOW AND THE DOOR WAS SOON OPENED BY THE YAWNING LANDLORD
WHAT SHE HEARD OF COL
HE'S A FINE MAN A VERY FINE MAN
PEOPLE WERE INTRODUCED TO EACH OTHER AS FROM THIS OR THAT STATE NOT FROM CITIES OR TOWNS AND THIS GAVE A LARGENESS TO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE FEELING
PERHAPS NOT IN WASHINGTON REPLIED PHILIP,--TEMPTED INTO A SIMILAR TONE
IT WOULD BE LIKE GETTING EXCITED OVER THE EMPANELING OF A CORONER'S JURY IN A MURDER CASE INSTEAD OF SAVING UP ONE'S EMOTIONS FOR THE GRANDER OCCASION OF THE HANGING OF THE ACCUSED TWO YEARS LATER AFTER ALL THE TEDIOUS FORMS OF LAW HAD BEEN GONE THROUGH WITH
THE LAW IS WHAT I WAS BORN FOR
NOBLE SAID HE WAS POOR AND IT WAS HARD TO TEMPT HIM SO
HAD THE FLIGHT ANYTHING TO DO WITH SELBY
LAURA WAS ILL FOR A LONG TIME BUT SHE RECOVERED
HEARD--YOUNG MISS VOICE TAKE YOUR CHOICE THEN
IN THE MIDST OF A PROFOUND HUSH LAURA ENTERED LEANING ON THE ARM OF THE OFFICER AND WAS CONDUCTED TO A SEAT BY HER COUNSEL
ABOVE ALL THINGS MY CHILDREN BE HONEST
YOU I'VE MADE HIM PROMISE TO VOTE WITH US INCREDIBLE
WELL THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE
IF HE EVER WONDERED THAT ALICE HERSELF WAS NOT IN LOVE AND NEVER SPOKE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF HER OWN MARRIAGE IT WAS A TRANSIENT THOUGHT FOR LOVE DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY EXACTLY TO ONE SO CALM AND EVENLY BALANCED AND WITH SO MANY RESOURCES IN HER HERSELF
OH SAID HER MOTHER IF SHE WERE ONLY IN HER COOL AND SPACIOUS ROOM IN OUR OLD HOME
THIS WAS DOUBTLESS THE NEW ONE OF WHICH THE JANITOR SPOKE
SHE WAS ABOUT TO BREAK THE TWIG BUT SHE HESITATED AND SAID
SHE LOOKED STEADILY AT PHILIP AND BEGAN BY WHAT RIGHT SIR BY THE RIGHT OF FRIENDSHIP INTERRUPTED PHILIP STOUTLY
HE KNEW LAURA AND SHE HAD A GREAT RESPECT FOR HIS CHARACTER HIS OPINIONS HIS JUDGMENT
NOT BEING A NEWSPAPER REPORTER HE COULD NOT SEE EITHER OF THEM THAT NIGHT
PROBABLY HE HAS LIVED ALL HIS LIFE ON HIS PLANTATION IT WAS A DAY RECEPTION OF MRS REPRESENTATIVE SCHOONMAKER A SWEET WOMAN OF SIMPLE AND SINCERE MANNERS
BUT AS SOON AS MARIA WAS GONE LAURA STAMPED HER EXPRESSIVE FOOT AND SAID
IT WAS PHILIP'S PLAN WHO HAD ENGAGED THE SEATS AND PROMISED HIMSELF AN EVENING WITH RUTH WALKING WITH HER SITTING BY HER IN THE HALL AND ENJOYING THE FEELING OF PROTECTING THAT A MAN ALWAYS HAS OF A WOMAN IN A PUBLIC PLACE
THANK FORTUNE I'M NOT A SIMPLETON
THERE WAS A DEAD BLANK OF A MONTH OR MORE THAT SUPPLIED NOT AN ITEM TO HIS RECOLLECTION
SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS NOW ASKED TO TAKE THE STAND AND TELL WHAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE MAN NOBLE
JIM WAS IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES,--WITH HIS COAT AND VEST ON HIS ARM
HE HALTED A MOMENT AND THEN SAID
THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE IN THESE FIGURES
HE MIGHT COME BACK TO HER
WE MIGHT ALL HAVE BEEN PROSPEROUS NOW
AND IF IT'S GOT A FEW SCRIPTURE QUOTATIONS IN IT AND SOME TEMPERANCE PLATITUDES AND A BIT OF GUSH HERE AND THERE ABOUT SUNDAY SCHOOLS AND A SENTIMENTAL SNUFFLE NOW AND THEN ABOUT GOD'S PRECIOUS ONES THE HONEST HARD-HANDED POOR IT WORKS THE NATION LIKE A CHARM MY DEAR SIR AND NEVER A MAN SUSPECTS THAT IT IS AN ADVERTISEMENT
MIXED UP WITH HIS OWN EXPLOITS AND HIS DAILY TRIUMPHS AS A LOBBYIST ESPECIALLY IN THE MATTER OF THE NEW UNIVERSITY IN WHICH HARRY WAS TO HAVE SOMETHING HANDSOME WERE AMUSING SKETCHES OF WASHINGTON SOCIETY HINTS ABOUT DILWORTHY STORIES ABOUT COL
SHE WAS MY AGENT
WITH HIS USUAL CONSIDERATION FOR HIS WIFE MR HAWKINS HAD SHIELDED HER FROM THE WORRY THE MATTER WOULD HAVE CAUSED HER
WHAT A FOOL I WOULD HAVE BEEN TO SELL IT FOR SUCH A BEGGARLY TRIFLE
EVERYBODY CHASES BUTTERFLIES
AND THAT REMARK HAS ALWAYS CHEERED ME
HE WROTE AGAIN IN AN UNOFFENDED BUSINESS LIKE TONE SUGGESTING THAT HE HAD BETTER DRAW AT THREE DAYS
THE MARRIAGE RELATION WOMAN'S FATE ANYTHING OF THAT SORT
KEEP YOUR MONEY CLOSE AND ADD TO IT
CHAPTER III
M NO ONE OF THE FAMILY WAS LIKELY TO BE IN THE HOUSE EXCEPT LAURA
BUT ISN'T THERE SOMETHING ELSE YOU COULD GIVE ME TOO LAURA LOOKED AT HIM INQUIRINGLY A MOMENT AND THEN SHE COMPREHENDED
IT'S ENOUGH I SHOULD JUDGE
ONCE WHEN YOU WERE ABOUT TO ENTER THE LADIES CAR WITHOUT KNOWING IT WAS A LADY'S CAR
YOUR PRESENCE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WILL INSPIRE HER WITH THE DESIRE TO LIVE WHEN THE FEVER TURNED RUTH WAS IN A VERY CRITICAL CONDITION
BUT IT'S BETTER FOR HER--BETTER FOR HER
CHAPTER XXXVI
IT DWELT UPON IT AS THE ONE BRIEF INTERVAL OF HER LIFE THAT BORE NO CURSE
UNCLE DILWORTHY UNCLE BALLOON!--TELLS VERY AMUSING STORIES WHEN LADIES ARE NOT PRESENT I SHOULD THINK SO M M
YOU'VE A PLEASANT TOWN HERE SIR AND THE MOST COMFORTABLE LOOKING HOTEL I'VE SEEN OUT OF NEW YORK SAID HARRY TO THE CLERK
SELBY CONGRATULATED HIMSELF
THE NEIGHBORS HELPED HIM PUT OUT THE CONFLAGRATION BUT THEY DISCOURAGED ANY MORE EXPERIMENTS OF THAT SORT
HE WILL DO MORE FOR THE PENSION BILL THAN ANY OTHER MAN COULD DO
IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE PHILIP GOT TO SLEEP
IT'S A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY AND A BODY WANTS TO GO CAUTIOUS
14
AND HAVE NOT BOTH THESE CAUTIOUS PEOPLE EXPRESSED A DETERMINATION TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE ILIUM MINE WHEN THEY CATCH THEIR LARKS
IF HE SEEKS HIS DAUGHTER IT IS THE PURPOSELESS SEARCH OF A LUNATIC AS ONE WHO WANDERS BEREFT OF REASON CRYING WHERE IS MY CHILD
EVERY MILESTONE MARKED A DISASTER
PHILIP SAW FROM THE WINDOW THAT A GENTLEMAN HAD PUT HER UPON THE CAR JUST AS IT WAS STARTING
THAT IS A PECULIAR CONDITION OF SOCIETY WHICH ENABLES A WHOLE NATION TO INSTANTLY RECOGNIZE POINT AND MEANING IN THE FAMILIAR NEWSPAPER ANECDOTE WHICH PUTS INTO THE MOUTH OF A DISTINGUISHED SPECULATOR IN LANDS AND MINES THIS REMARK:--"I WASN'T WORTH A CENT TWO YEARS AGO AND NOW I OWE TWO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS CHAPTER XXVII
WHO SHALL SAY THAT THIS IS NOT THE GOLDEN AGE OF MUTUAL TRUST OF UNLIMITED RELIANCE UPON HUMAN PROMISES
FROM THE EAST PERHAPS
SUNSET CAME AND STILL THE FIGHT WENT ON
THE REPORTERS IMMEDIATELY TELEGRAPHED THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL.--AND THEY ADDED
THAT WILL DO SIR
AND THEN HE LISTENED EAGERLY
HARRY HAD BESIEGED THE NEW YORK HEADQUARTERS OF THE COLUMBUS RIVER SLACK-WATER NAVIGATION COMPANY WITH DEMANDS THEN COMMANDS AND FINALLY APPEALS BUT TO NO PURPOSE
WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR A GENTLEMAN TO GET EVEN WITH SUCH A FELLOW AS THAT CONDUCTOR ON THE LETTER'S OWN PLANE
BUT FATIGUE WAS TELLING UPON HIM NOW AND HE WAS QUIET AND SPEECHLESS--FOR ONCE
SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS OFFERED A GRAND OVATION BY HIS FRIENDS AT HOME WHO SAID THAT THEIR AFFECTION FOR HIM AND THEIR CONFIDENCE IN HIM WERE IN NO WISE IMPAIRED BY THE PERSECUTIONS THAT HAD PURSUED HIM AND THAT HE WAS STILL GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM
NOBODY GOES THERE MISS HAWKINS--AT LEAST ONLY PERSONS OF NO POSITION IN SOCIETY
ONCE AFTER THAT FOR SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
THEN TWO OR THREE DAYS OF CALMING DOWN BY DEGREES--A RECEDING OF TIDES A QUIETING OF THE STORM-WASH TO A MURMUROUS SURF-BEAT A DIMINISHING OF DEVASTATING WINDS TO A REFRAIN THAT BORE THE SPIRIT OF A TRUCE-DAYS GIVEN TO SOLITUDE REST SELF-COMMUNION AND THE REASONING OF HERSELF INTO A REALIZATION OF THE FACT THAT SHE WAS ACTUALLY DONE WITH BOLTS AND BARS PRISON HORRORS AND IMPENDING DEATH
BUT SHE WAS SOON THINKING AGAIN AND WAS ONLY GAZING INTO VACANCY
NOTHING OF THIS WAS LOST ON HIM
TUCK HIS CRAP DOWN
PHILIP WISHED TO BE ALONE
I'VE SEEN A PERFECTLY CAPABLE HONEST MAN TIME AND AGAIN RUN AGAINST AN ILLITERATE TRICKSTER AND GET BEATEN
THE FIGHT WAS FOUGHT THE LONG STRUGGLE WAS OVER AND HE WAS A PAUPER
WHAT WAS HE DOING
BUT HOW IS THIS GOING TO BENEFIT YOU AFTER I HAVE MANAGED IT
BY AND BY HIS LIPS TREMBLED AND HIS VOICE GOT UNSTEADY
HE WOULD SEEK THIS MAN NOBLE
MR B
CLAY'S DOG PUT UP HIS BROWN NOSE FOR A LITTLE ATTENTION AND GOT IT
EVERYBODY HERE SAYS YOU CAN'T GET A THING LIKE THIS THROUGH CONGRESS WITHOUT BUYING COMMITTEES FOR STRAIGHT-OUT CASH ON DELIVERY BUT I THINK I'VE TAUGHT THEM A THING OR TWO--IF I COULD ONLY MAKE THEM BELIEVE IT
YOU CAN'T GET ANY PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT THROUGH ON REASONABLE TERMS
HE SAID THAT HIS PARTY WOULD CAST HIM OUT IF HE VOTED FOR MR DILWORTHY
THIS CHEERFUL INVITATION TO THE TAVERN WAS THE REMAINS OF A HUGE PANTHER WHICH HAD BEEN KILLED IN THE REGION A FEW WEEKS BEFORE
WHICH IS TRUE ENOUGH MISS LAURA AND HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH THOUGHT OF IN CONNECTION WITH NAPOLEON
HOW REGULARLY HE DOES TURN UP TO BE SURE
YOU SAID O BOTHER WHAT I SAID,"--AND THE COLONEL TOOK UP HIS SWORD TO BUCKLE IT ON AND THEN CONTINUED COOLLY THE FACT IS LAURA OUR ROMANCE IS PLAYED OUT LAURA HEARD BUT SHE DID NOT COMPREHEND
HE COULD HARDLY HAVE SAILED FOR HIS NAME DOES NOT APPEAR UPON THE BOOKS OF ANY SHIPPING OFFICE IN NEW YORK OR BOSTON OR BALTIMORE
IT WAS DURING THE MORNING WALK TO WHICH REFERENCE HAS BEEN MADE THAT HENRY BRIERLY SUDDENLY SAID PHILIP HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO ST JO I THINK I SHOULD LIKE IT OF ALL THINGS REPLIED PHILIP WITH SOME HESITATION BUT WHAT FOR OH IT'S A BIG OPERATION
IF HE WILL GO WITH ME I WILL GIVE HIM A HOME AND LOVING REGARD--I WILL DO FOR HIM AS I WOULD HAVE ANOTHER DO FOR A CHILD OF MY OWN IN MISFORTUNE ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE PEOPLE STEPPED FORWARD AND WRUNG THE STRANGER'S HAND WITH CORDIAL GOOD WILL AND THEIR EYES LOOKED ALL THAT THEIR HANDS COULD NOT EXPRESS OR THEIR LIPS SPEAK
THREE YEARS OF INTRODUCTORY TRADE IN THE ORIENT AND WHAT WILL BE THE RESULT
THAT'S ENCOURAGING
THAT'S ENCOURAGING
YOU'VE ACTED FAIR AND SQUARE WITH US EVERY TIME AND I RECKON WE ARE MEN AND KNOW A MAN WHEN WE SEE HIM
OR WOULD NOT THE TRUER WAY BE TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE SENATOR WAS CAPABLE OF BEING ENTRAPPED INTO SO SHAMELESS AN ACT AND THEN TRY HIM
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN NERVOUS BUT SHE FANCIED SOMEBODY WAS TRYING TO GET INTO THE HOUSE
THE GOOD OPINION OF MY FELLOW CITIZENS OF ALL SECTIONS IS THE SWEETEST SOLACE IN ALL MY ANXIETIES
ALMOST EVERY OTHER ONE HAD SOME CLAIM OR INTEREST OR REMEDY TO URGE
I WAS A SCOUNDREL
NOW SHE HAS GONE OFF TO SLEEP AGAIN AS COMFORTABLY AS IF SHE WERE USED TO PICKING UP A MILLION DOLLARS EVERY DAY OR TWO THEN HE WENT TO BED
I WISH THAT WE MIGHT HAVE YOU IN WASHINGTON--AS CHAPLAIN NOW IN THE SENATE THE GOOD MAN COULD NOT BUT BE A LITTLE FLATTERED AND IF SOMETIMES THEREAFTER IN HIS DISCOURAGING WORK HE ALLOWED THE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS BE CALLED TO WASHINGTON AS CHAPLAIN OF THE SENATE TO CHEER HIM WHO CAN WONDER
EXAMINED THE ERASURE CRITICALLY TO SEE IF ANYBODY COULD GUESS AT WHAT THE WORD HAD BEEN
BUT HE NEVER DOES
PEOPLE WHO MADE WAY FOR THEM TO PASS TURNED TO LOOK AT THEM
IN THIS DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY HE WAS OBLIGED TO CONCEAL HIS ROYALTY UNDER A PLEBEIAN ASPECT
RUTH WAS STILL LIVING THEN
THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE WASHINGTON WEATHER HAD INFLUENCED HIS DREAMS PERHAPS FOR DURING THE RECENT TEMPEST OF APPLAUSE HE HAD HOISTED HIS GINGHAM UMBRELLA AND CALMLY GONE ON WITH HIS SLUMBERS
HIS LONG SIEGE OF UNPRODUCTIVE LABOR WAS BEGINNING TO TELL UPON HIS SPIRITS
IF THIS DON'T GET ME
IT IS CUSTOMARY TO LEND NEARLY ANYBODY MONEY TO START A BANK WITH ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE NOT THE MONEY TO LEND HIM AND HAVE TO BORROW IT FOR THE PURPOSE
VERY FEW MEN COULD GO THERE AND GET A MONEY BILL THROUGH WITHOUT BUYING A SINGLE COME NOW MR PRESIDENT THAT'S PLENTY OF THAT
THAT HE COULD NOT BEAR TO BE AWAY FROM LOUISE
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PALACE FOR AUGHT HE KNEW
AND THAT WAS THE REASON PROBABLY WHY PEOPLE OF REFINEMENT LIKED TO GO THERE
BETS WERE MADE BY THE SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES ON THE VERDICT WITH LARGE ODDS IN FAVOR OF A DISAGREEMENT
AND RUTH IN TURN IT MUST BE CONFESSED PROBING ALICE SOMETIMES WITH HER SERIOUS GREY EYES WONDERED WHAT HER OBJECT IN LIFE WAS AND WHETHER SHE HAD ANY PURPOSE BEYOND LIVING AS SHE NOW SAW HER
BUT IT USED TO SURPRISE EVEN THE COLONEL WHEN HE READ IT IT WAS EMBELLISHED TO THAT DEGREE THAT HE HARDLY RECOGNIZED IT AND THE HINT WAS NOT LOST ON HIM
WAS WOMAN EVER PRUDENT WHEN SHE LOVED
THE USUAL SUNDAY SCHOOL EXERCISES WERE HURRIED THROUGH AND THEN THE MINISTER GOT UP AND BORED THE HOUSE WITH A SPEECH BUILT ON THE CUSTOMARY SUNDAY SCHOOL PLAN
ANOTHER HITCH SOMEWHERE
HARRY WAS CORDIALLY ASKED TO BRING HIS TRAVELING-BAG THERE AND HE DID NOT NEED URGING TO DO SO
AND HE REMEMBERED HOW THIS NEW MOTHER TUCKED HIM IN HIS BED IN THE NEIGHBORING FARM HOUSE AND COAXED HIM TO TALK ABOUT HIS TROUBLES AND THEN HEARD HIM SAY HIS PRAYERS AND KISSED HIM GOOD NIGHT AND LEFT HIM WITH THE SORENESS IN HIS HEART ALMOST HEALED AND HIS BRUISED SPIRIT AT REST
HE MADE WASHINGTON EASY IN HIS MIND THOUGH BY PROMISING THAT HE WOULD CALL FOR IT JUST AS SOON AS THE INVENTION WAS FINISHED AND HE ADDED THE GLAD TIDINGS THAT NOBODY BUT JUST THEY TWO SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO A SHARE IN THE SPECULATION
NOBLE PROMISES DAMAGING EXPOSURES CONCERNING DILWORTHY AND CERTAIN MEASURES OF HIS NOW PENDING IN CONGRESS
IF WE WERE OBLIGED TO DO IT I WOULDN'T MIND IT
AND IF YOU'LL JUST LOOK AT THEIR ADVERTISING PAGES YOU'LL OBSERVE THAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK A GOOD DEAL AS I DO--ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOT LITTLE FINANCIAL SCHEMES TO MAKE EVERYBODY RICH WITH
COME NOW DON'T TALK SO
WHAT ONE USEFUL THING COULD I DO FOR A LIVING FOR THE SUPPORT OF MOTHER AND THE CHILDREN

GENTLEMEN I SHALL ASK YOU TO GO WITH ME AWAY FROM THIS COURT ROOM AND ITS MINIONS OF THE LAW AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF THIS TRAGEDY TO A DISTANT I WISH I COULD SAY A HAPPIER DAY
THIS HAS NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH THE CASE YOUR HONOR
HE SWORE THAT AS SOON AS SHE SUCCEEDED WITH HER BILL HE WOULD FLY WITH HER TO ANY PART OF THE WORLD
DO YOU SEE THESE PAPERS
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN HE STAYED WITH ME HE ASKED ABOUT FAMILY PRAYERS WHETHER WE HAD EM BEFORE OR AFTER BREAKFAST
AS THE HOURS DRAGGED ON THE CHILD LOST HEART AND CRIED SO PITEOUSLY FOR HER MOTHER THAT IT SEEMED TO THE HAWKINSES THAT THE MOANINGS AND THE WAILINGS OF THE MUTILATED MEN AND WOMEN IN THE SALOON DID NOT SO STRAIN AT THEIR HEART-STRINGS AS THE SUFFERINGS OF THIS LITTLE DESOLATE CREATURE
MY HUSBAND SOMETIMES SAYS THAT HE DOESN'T SEE BUT CONFEDERATES ARE JUST AS EAGER TO GET AT THE TREASURY AS UNIONISTS
DON'T APPEAR TO BE ANY NIGHT-HAWK ON THE JACK-STAFF--IT'S THE AMARANTH DEAD SURE THE CAPTAIN TOOK A GOOD LONG LOOK AND ONLY SAID
RUTH ONLY WENT TO TOWN TWICE A WEEK TO ATTEND LECTURES AND THE HOUSEHOLD WAS QUITE TO MR BOLTON'S TASTE FOR HE LIKED THE CHEER OF COMPANY AND SOMETHING GOING ON EVENINGS
BUT WE'LL NOT STARVE NANCY
RUN ALONG HOME NOW AND TELL LAURA
S WROUGHT IN BRASS NAILS ON ITS TOP
SELLERS URGING HIM TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND CONFER WITH SENATOR DILWORTHY
THIS WAS A SENATOR OF THE WORN-OUT AND OBSOLETE PATTERN
WOMEN DON'T GET ANYTHING BY PETITIONING CONGRESS
THE CONDUCTOR TURNED TOWARDS PHILIP AND COOLLY AND DELIBERATELY SURVEYED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH CONTEMPT IN EVERY LINE OF HIS FACE TURNED HIS BACK UPON HIM WITHOUT A WORD AND SAID TO THE LADY COME I'VE GOT NO TIME TO TALK
THAT IS TO SAY THAT WHAT WASHINGTON REGARDED AT FIRST SIGHT AS MERE LOWLY POTATOES PRESENTLY BECAME AWE-INSPIRING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIONS THAT HAD BEEN REARED IN SOME DUCAL GARDEN BEYOND THE SEA UNDER THE SACRED EYE OF THE DUKE HIMSELF WHO HAD SENT THEM TO SELLERS
A DREARY MELANCHOLY SETTLED DOWN UPON HER
FOR HIMSELF HE BELIEVED THAT THE GUILT OF SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS ESTABLISHED BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT
WHEN THE STATESMAN MADE REMARKS IN THESE MEETINGS HE NOT INFREQUENTLY ALLUDED WITH EFFECT TO THE ENCOURAGING SPECTACLE OF ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST AND MOST BRILLIANT YOUNG FAVORITES OF SOCIETY FORSAKING THE LIGHT VANITIES OF THAT BUTTERFLY EXISTENCE TO NOBLY AND SELF-SACRIFICINGLY DEVOTE HIS TALENTS AND HIS RICHES TO THE CAUSE OF SAVING HIS HAPLESS FELLOW CREATURES FROM SHAME AND MISERY HERE AND ETERNAL REGRET HEREAFTER
CRIES OF PUT HIM OUT MY FRIENDS DO NOT REMOVE HIM
GREAT HEAVEN WHAT AN ESCAPE I'VE MADE
A WHOLE ARMY NANCY
LAURA TOOK IT AND READ
LATE ONE AFTERNOON HE FINISHED DRILLING A HOLE WHICH HE HAD BEEN AT WORK AT FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS
NOW THERE IS NO USE IN YOU AND I DEALING IN PRETENSES AND GOING AT MATTERS IN ROUND-ABOUT WAYS
IT'S THE GRANDEST COUNTRY--THE LOVELIEST LAND--THE PUREST ATMOSPHERE--I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT
THE AWFUL ISSUE AT STAKE GIVES SIGNIFICANCE TO THE LIGHTEST WORD OR LOOK
AND IT IS USEFUL TO ME--IT IS BOUND TO BE SO
INDEED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
AND SOMETIMES I THINK I'LL HAVE EVER SO MANY WEATHERCOCKS AND WATER-WHEELS
IT BELONGED TO HIS GRANDMOTHER THE LOOK AND THE TONE WERE A PLAIN CALL FOR ADMIRING SURPRISE AND THEREFORE WASHINGTON SAID IT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT OFFERED ITSELF AT THE MOMENT INDEED YES IT DID DIDN'T IT FATHER EXCLAIMED ONE OF THE TWINS
WHEN YOU REACHED THE HOTEL IT WAS SLEETING
WE SEND MANY MISSIONARIES TO LIFT UP THE BENIGHTED RACES OF OTHER LANDS
GOD SAVE THE MARK ATTEMPTED TO FORCE HERSELF INTO THE ALREADY FULL PALATIAL CAR
AND BESIDES I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HAWKEYE AND MAKE YOU PROMISE TO COME AND SEE US WHEN WE ARE SETTLED THERE BUT MARIA COULD NOT STAY
ORDER GENTLEMEN
BUT HER FACE WAS SOON AGLOW OVER ITS PAGES AND SHE WAS SO ABSORBED IN IT THAT SHE DID NOT NOTICE THE ENTRANCE OF HER MOTHER AT THE OPEN DOOR
I COULD HARDLY KEEP THE TEARS BACK I WAS SO GRATEFUL
WHY OF COURSE
BY THE SAME RULE I SHOULD JUDGE THAT COL
I TELL YOUR NANCY FOR GOODNESS SAKE SI WAIT NANCY WAIT--LET ME FINISH--I'VE BEEN SECRETLY BAILING AND FUMING WITH THIS GRAND INSPIRATION FOR WEEKS AND I MUST TALK OR I'LL BURST
THAT'S THE REGULAR ROUTINE--EVERYTHING'S RED TAPE AND ROUTINE IN THE LAW YOU SEE
BEAUTIFUL DEMON OF MONEY WHAT AN ENCHANTER THOU ART
AND HE REFINED IT HIMSELF TILL IT WAS LIKE WATER NEARLY AND IT DID BURN THERE'S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT THAT
GAD SAYS HARRY TO THE COLONEL SHE'S A SUPERB CREATURE SHE'D MAKE A STIR IN NEW YORK MONEY OR NO MONEY
SHE COULD NOT BE
DE LORD KIN PEAR EBERYWHAH IN A SECOND
AND HE DID TALK TO HER BY THE HOUR ABOUT RUTH
IT WAS ONLY THE SECOND TIME EITHER OF THEM HAD BEEN UPON A MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOAT AND NEARLY EVERYTHING THEY SAW HAD THE CHARM OF NOVELTY
THE COLONEL WAS READY TO TAKE HIM AROUND AND INTRODUCE HIM TO THE EMPLOYMENT HE HAD FOUND FOR HIM BUT WASHINGTON BEGGED FOR A FEW MOMENTS IN WHICH TO WRITE HOME
OTHERS THAT YOU DON'T CARE ANY MORE FOR HIM THAN YOU DO FOR A DOZEN OTHERS BUT THAT HE IS COMPLETELY FASCINATED WITH YOU AND ABOUT TO DESERT HIS WIFE
THE BLUES RETURNED IN FEARFUL FORCE AND SHE HAD TO GO OUT OF THE ROOM TO HIDE THE TEARS THAT NOTHING COULD KEEP BACK NOW
BUT HE WAS A COWARD BEFORE THIS WOMAN
DR PUFFER INSISTED THAT THE MAN DIED FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE WOUND IN THE CHEST
BUT HE SAW THAT THE SENATOR WAS WOUNDED BY THE SUGGESTION
I HAVE KNOWN PERSONS OF THY AGE WHO DID NOT
DATE'S DE HEBREW CHIL'EN DAT WENT FROUGH DE FIAH
HE WAS HAUNTED WITH MANY ANXIETIES
SHE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE MUCH DISTRESSED ABOUT ME--SHE HASN'T LOOKED THIS WAY ONCE
HE WAS IN GOOD COMPANY NOW
EMBRACE OUR AIMS
SHE BEGAN HER ANATOMICAL PRACTICE UPON DETACHED PORTIONS OF THE HUMAN FRAME WHICH WERE BROUGHT INTO THE DEMONSTRATING ROOM--DISSECTING THE EYE THE EAR AND A SMALL TANGLE OF MUSCLES AND NERVES--AN OCCUPATION WHICH HAD NOT MUCH MORE SAVOR OF DEATH IN IT THAN THE ANALYSIS OF A PORTION OF A PLANT OUT OF WHICH THE LIFE WENT WHEN IT WAS PLUCKED UP BY THE ROOTS
THE POPULAR RAGE NEVER LASTS LONG
AT THE SAME MOMENT THE LADY IN THE BONNET ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM AND SAID SOMETHING LIKE GEORGE WILL YOU GO WITH ME HE REPLIED THROWING UP HIS HAND AND RETREATING MY GOD I CAN'T DON'T FIRE AND THE NEXT INSTANTS TWO SHOTS WERE HEARD AND HE FELL
AND WHAT HAVE REST AND CONTENTMENT TO DO WITH LOVE
HE COMIN NOW LIKE HE FO'GOT SUMFIN
TO DANCE TO GO TO THEATRES
WHERE WAS HIS COOLNESS
AND I'LL BRING THINGS ALL RIGHT YET HONEY--CHEER UP AND DON'T YOU FEAR
WASHINGTON'S COME CHILDREN
DID HE EVER HEAR OF THIS CASE
WON'T I FIX YOU THOUGH!--PONIES COWS DOGS EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF THAT'LL DELIGHT A CHILD'S HEART--AND--WHY HOW'S THIS
BRIDGET AND I SET UP ALL NIGHT AND THE DOCTOR STAID TILL TWO IN THE MORNING BLESS HIS OLD HEART.--WHEN MOTHER GOT THERE SHE WAS SO USED UP WITH ANXIETY THAT SHE HAD TO GO TO BED AND HAVE THE DOCTOR
WASHINGTON'S DISTRESS OF MIND WAS CHIEFLY ON LAURA'S ACCOUNT
HIS BALD HEADED SURROUNDINGS MADE THE YOUTH THE MORE CONSPICUOUS
NOW THERE'S A GOOD TITLE
HUNDREDS OF MANGLED REMAINS ARE SENT INTO ETERNITY
PILE IT IN
PHILIP HAS COME PHILIP HAS COME CRIED THE CHILDREN AS IF SOME GREAT GOOD HAD AGAIN COME INTO THE HOUSEHOLD
WE HAD CAST THEM UPON THEIR OWN RESOURCES
WE WOULDN'T ENGINEER LONG WHEN DO YOU GO WAS PHILIP'S NEXT QUESTION AFTER SOME MOMENTS OF SILENCE
UNCLE DAN'L POINTED DOWN THE RIVER WITH HIS BONY FINGER
AND GENERAL SELLERS HAS ACCEPTED A RECEPTION AND BANQUET BY THE COSMOPOLITAN CLUB
SELLERS WHO HAD BECOME A WELL-KNOWN CHARACTER AND WISE REMARKS UPON THE MACHINERY OF PRIVATE LEGISLATION FOR THE PUBLIC-GOOD WHICH GREATLY ENTERTAINED PHILIP IN HIS CONVALESCENCE
CHEER UP
SHE ALLOWED HIM
  PART 2
THE ATTORNEY ADDED THAT THE DUTY OF THE JURY HOWEVER PAINFUL IT MIGHT BE WOULD BE PLAIN AND SIMPLE
SHE WAS INDIFFERENT WHAT CAME AFTER
ON WHAT FOR INSTANCE JUST NOW ASKED RUTH A LITTLE MALICIOUSLY PHILIP THOUGHT
PERHAPS SHE WAS THINKING AFTER ALL WHETHER SHE KNEW HERSELF
HE HAD BEEN UNIVERSALLY TRUSTED AND HONORED IN HIS DAY BUT HAD FINALLY FALLEN INTO MISFORTUNE
HE BEGAN TO TELL ABOUT AN ENORMOUS SPECULATION HE WAS THINKING OF EMBARKING SOME CAPITAL IN--A SPECULATION WHICH SOME LONDON BANKERS HAD BEEN OVER TO CONSULT WITH HIM ABOUT--AND SOON HE WAS BUILDING GLITTERING PYRAMIDS OF COIN AND WASHINGTON WAS PRESENTLY GROWING OPULENT UNDER THE MAGIC OF HIS ELOQUENCE
WHEN SHE TRIPPED DOWN THE STREET ON A SUMMER'S DAY WITH HER DAINTY HANDS PROPPED INTO THE RIBBON-BROIDERED POCKETS OF HER APRON AND ELBOWS CONSEQUENTLY MORE OR LESS AKIMBO WITH HER WIDE LEGHORN HAT FLAPPING DOWN AND HIDING HER FACE ONE MOMENT AND BLOWING STRAIGHT UP AGAINST HER FORE HEAD THE NEXT AND MAKING ITS REVEALMENT OF FRESH YOUNG BEAUTY
JUST A PLAIN FAMILY DINNER BUT SUCH AS IT IS OUR FRIENDS ARE ALWAYS WELCOME I RECKON YOU KNOW THAT YOURSELF WASHINGTON
MY CHILD YOU CAN'T MEAN THAT YOU I'VE MADE HIM PROMISE ON HONOR TO THINK ABOUT A COMPROMISE TONIGHT AND COME AND TELL ME HIS DECISION IN THE MORNING GOOD
I SHOULD INSIST UPON YOUR GOING TO MY HOUSE IF YOU WERE NOT CLAIMED BY YOUR OLDER FRIEND GEN
IN SHORT THIS AMAZING ACTOR SUCCEEDED SO WELL WITH MRS BOLTON THAT SHE SAID TO PHILIP ONE DAY THY FRIEND HENRY BRIERLY APPEARS TO BE A VERY WORLDLY MINDED YOUNG MAN
PERHAPS LAURA ENJOYED HIS TORMENT BUT SHE SOOTHED HIM WITH BLANDISHMENTS THAT INCREASED HIS ARDOR AND SHE SMILED TO HERSELF TO THINK THAT HE HAD WITH ALL HIS PROTESTATIONS OF LOVE NEVER SPOKEN OF MARRIAGE
THE UNRESPONSIVE EARTH HAD UTTERED NO VOICE OF FLOWERS IN TESTIMONY THAT ONE WHO WAS BLEST HAD GONE THAT ROAD
THERE WAS A SKELETON HANGING IN THE CLOSET OF MY FATHER'S STUDY WHEN I WAS A BOY THAT I USED TO DRESS UP IN OLD CLOTHES
IT'S THE ONLY PART OF THE RAILROAD I'M INTERESTED IN,--DOWN ALONG THE LINE--AND IT'S ALL I WANT TOO
PERHAPS SHE HAD SOME HOLD ON HIM PERHAPS SHE WAS NECESSARY TO HIS PLAN FOR AMELIORATING THE CONDITION OF THE COLORED RACE
NOT THAT SAID THE COLONEL TO THE BAR-KEEPER WHO SHOVED ALONG THE COUNTER A BOTTLE OF APPARENTLY CORN-WHISKEY AS IF HE HAD DONE IT BEFORE ON THE SAME ORDER
AFTER ALL HIS FAITHFUL HARD TOIL WITH HIS HANDS AND RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER ON HIS BUSY FEET
THE SEX THE AGE THE BEAUTY OF THE PRISONER
NOTHING DELIGHTS IT MORE THAN THE SHARP RETORT OF A WITNESS AND THE DISCOMFITURE OF AN OBNOXIOUS ATTORNEY
IF YOU REALLY ARE SO LOW AS TO THINK I AM ABSENT WHEN I AM PRESENT IT'S A FRIGHTFUL CASE OF ABERRATION
IN ALL PARTS OF THE LATE SLAVE STATES
PHILIP STOOD UPON THE PLATFORM AND WATCHED FOR THE BOLTONS HOUSE FANCIED HE COULD DISTINGUISH ITS ROOF AMONG THE TREES AND WONDERED HOW RUTH WOULD FEEL IF SHE KNEW HE WAS SO NEAR HER
HE SAID HE SHOULD LIKE TO HELP THE NEGRO HIS HEART WENT OUT TO THE NEGRO AND ALL THAT--PLENTY OF THEM SAY THAT BUT HE WAS A LITTLE AFRAID OF THE TENNESSEE LAND BILL
SELLERS AND LAID THE APPROPRIATION SCHEME AWAY AMONG HIS OTHER PLANS FOR BENEFITING THE PUBLIC
ONE BY ONE ITS MEAGRE PARCEL OF INHABITANTS PACKED UP AND MOVED AWAY AS THE SUMMER WANED AND FALL APPROACHED
AFTER A SEASON SHE KISSED THE FOREHEAD REVERENTLY DREW THE SHEET UP OVER THE FACE AND THEN WALKED APART AND SAT DOWN WITH THE LOOK OF ONE WHO IS DONE WITH LIFE AND HAS NO FURTHER INTEREST IN ITS JOYS AND SORROWS ITS HOPES OR ITS AMBITIONS
THEY FOUND LAURA IN A CELL IN THE UPPER TIER OF THE WOMEN'S DEPARTMENT
THE NEXT MORNING THEY HARNESSED UP THEIR TEAM AND FOR TWO DAYS THEY WENDED SLOWLY INTO THE INTERIOR THROUGH ALMOST ROADLESS AND UNINHABITED FOREST SOLITUDES
I'M SURE I HATE THIS STOOPID COUNTRY ENOUGH EVEN IF IT IS OUR DEAR NATIVE LAND MISS EMMELINE GASHLY--"WHAT AND LEAVE POOR JOHNNY PETERSON BEHIND AN AIRY GENIAL LAUGH APPLAUDED THIS SALLY MISS GASHLY--"SISTER I SHOULD THINK YOU'D BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF MISS EMMELINE--"OH YOU NEEDN'T RUFFLE YOUR FEATHERS SO
MARGARET BOLTON WAS TOO WISE TO BE EITHER SURPRISED OR ALARMED BY THESE RUMORS
BUT WASHINGTON GATHERED ITS PEOPLE FROM THE FOUR WINDS OF HEAVEN AND SO THE MANNERS THE FACES AND THE FASHIONS THERE PRESENTED A VARIETY THAT WAS INFINITE
HE GRASPED THE SKIRT OF THE COAT IMPULSIVELY AND ANOTHER THRILL FOLLOWED
I ALWAYS SMOKE THIS SORT GENTLEMEN
