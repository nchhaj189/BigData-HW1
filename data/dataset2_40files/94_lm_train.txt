WILSON REFLECTED THAT HE HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN ABLE FOR ANY CONSIDERABLE WHILE TO SUPPORT BOTH A PERSONAL AND AN INTELLECTUAL PASSION
AND NOW WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE MATTER UP HERE THE YOUNG MAN IN A HURRIED NERVOUS WAY BEGAN HIS EXPLANATION
THERE'S THE CARRIAGE
HERE YOUR CIGARETTES ARE IN THIS DRAWER WHERE YOU LEFT THEM SHE STRUCK A MATCH AND LIT ONE FOR HIM
IT'S LIKE THE SONG
MR ALEXANDER WILL BE HOME AT THREE TO HANG THEM HIMSELF
ALEXANDER ARRIVED EARLY AND SOME TWENTY-ODD PEOPLE DROPPED IN DURING THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON
SHE DID MY BLOUSES BEAUTIFULLY THE LAST TIME I WAS THERE AND WAS SO DELIGHTED TO SEE ME AGAIN
HE FOUGHT HIS WAY UP THE DECK WITH KEEN EXHILARATION
HE HURRIED UP THE DECK AND WENT INTO THE SALOON PARLOR FULL OF WOMEN WHO HAD RETREATED THITHER FROM THE SHARP WIND
IT'S CURIOUS WATCHING BOYS HE WENT ON REFLECTIVELY
AND THERE IL TROVATORE CRIES A TALE OF DEEPER WRONG
THERE'S AN OXFORD MAN THAT LISTENS AND HIS HEART IS CRYING OUT IN THE CITY AS THE SUN SINKS LOW
SHE'LL DO WELL ENOUGH IF SHE KEEPS HER PACE AND DOESN'T GO OFF ON US IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON AS SHE'S MORE THAN LIKE TO DO HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DODGING ACQUAINTANCES AS HE WENT
BARTLEY SPRANG OUT AND SWUNG HER QUICKLY TO THE PAVEMENT
BUT WE CAN BE HAPPIER THAN ANYBODY
YOU MAY GO NOW HILDA SAT DOWN BY THE TABLE WITH THE LETTER IN HER HAND STILL UNOPENED
DEAR ME AM I
THE BRIDGE HAD NO IMPETUS EXCEPT FROM ITS OWN WEIGHT
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER SOME OF MINE OFF MY BACK IF I COULD
I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING BARTLEY TURNED AWAY AND SANK DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN
MARIE GOT THEM ALL FRESH IN COVENT GARDEN MARKET YESTERDAY MORNING I'M GLAD SAID ALEXANDER SIMPLY
IT WAS NONE OF ALEXANDER'S DOING OF COURSE
HERE COMES SIR HARRY TOWNE
ALEXANDER SINCE HE FIRST SAT DOWN HAD NOT CHANGED HIS POSITION
BUT YOU WON'T LET ME WRITE TO YOU AND I HAD TO SEE YOU AFTER THAT LETTER THAT TERRIBLE LETTER YOU WROTE ME WHEN YOU GOT HOME ALEXANDER FACED HER RESTING HIS ARM ON THE MANTEL BEHIND HIM AND BEGAN TO BRUSH THE SLEEVE OF HIS JACKET
THE LAST THING A BRIDGE COMMISSION CARES ABOUT IS THE KIND OF BRIDGE YOU BUILD WHEN BARTLEY HAD FINISHED DRESSING FOR DINNER HE WENT INTO HIS STUDY WHERE HE FOUND HIS WIFE ARRANGING FLOWERS ON HIS WRITING-TABLE
THEY WOULD PRETEND TO EAT THEIR OATS LIKE THE OTHER HORSES BUT WE KNEW THEY WERE ALWAYS SCHEMING TO GET BACK AT THE LOCO
THE NIGHTINGALE IS RATHER RARE AND YET THEY SAY YOU'LL HEAR HIM THERE AT KEW AT KEW IN LILAC TIME AND OH SO NEAR TO LONDON THE LINNET AND THE THROSTLE TOO AND AFTER DARK THE LONG HALLOO AND GOLDEN-EYED TU-WHIT TU WHOO OF OWLS THAT OGLE LONDON
AFTER DINNER ALEXANDER TOOK WILSON UP TO HIS STUDY
THERE WAS A ROSE-COLORED LIGHT OVER THE GRAY ROCKS AND HILLS AND MEADOWS
I SUPPOSE I WOULD BETTER DO IT WITHOUT TELLING YOU
HIS WORK IN MY OWN DEPARTMENT WAS QUITE ORDINARY
ONE OF THEM
THAT'S ALL TRUE PHIL BUT WE NEVER WERE JUSTIFIED IN ASSUMING THAT A SCALE THAT WAS PERFECTLY SAFE FOR AN ORDINARY BRIDGE WOULD WORK WITH ANYTHING OF SUCH LENGTH
AND WHEN IT HAD PASSED HOW LITTLE WORTH WHILE ANYTHING WAS
THE GLEAM OF THE RIVER AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL MADE HIM BLINK A LITTLE NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT WAS TOO BRIGHT AS BECAUSE HE FOUND IT SO PLEASANT
I SHOULD TORTURE MYSELF--I COULDN'T HELP IT AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO FORGET
ON SUNDAY THE DAY AFTER THIS NOTICE APPEARED ALEXANDER WORKED ALL DAY AT HIS TENTH STREET ROOMS
HE THREW HIMSELF UPON THEM
DIDN'T--DIDN'T YOU MEAN EVEN TO SAY GOODBY TO ME BARTLEY
TO-NIGHT IT CAME UPON HIM SUDDENLY AS HE WAS WALKING THE FLOOR AFTER HIS WIFE LEFT HIM
IT'S GETTING THE BETTER OF ME
WHAT WAS IT COMMANDER OF THE ORDER OF THE RISING SUN
HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING AT ALL
HORTON MET HER
THERE HAVE BEEN A GREAT MANY ACCIDENTS TO-DAY
HE FELT RELEASED FROM EVERYTHING THAT TROUBLED AND PERPLEXED HIM
ON SUCH RARE AFTERNOONS THE UGLIEST OF CITIES BECOMES THE MOST POETIC AND MONTHS OF SODDEN DAYS ARE OFFSET BY A MOMENT OF MIRACLE
THE ENERGY OF YOUTH WHICH MUST REGISTER ITSELF AND CUT ITS NAME BEFORE IT PASSES
CHAPTER IX ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
HE PAINTED THAT GROUP OF CYPRESSES FOR THE SALON AND IT WAS BOUGHT FOR THE LUXEMBOURG ALEXANDER WALKED OVER TO THE BOOKCASES
IT WOULD BE LIKE MARRYING COUSIN MIKE ALMOST
THAT IS THE MOST INTERESTING THING A TEACHER CAN FIND
HE SEEMED TO HAVE MADE A RESOLUTE EFFORT AT TIDINESS OF ATTIRE AND HIS SISTER A ROBUST FLORID WOMAN WITH A SPLENDID JOVIALITY ABOUT HER KEPT EYEING HIS FRESHLY CREASED CLOTHES APPREHENSIVELY
AS THE CARRIAGE TURNED UP THE HILL HE LIFTED ONE HAND AND BROUGHT IT DOWN VIOLENTLY
IT ISN'T FAR FROM LONDON END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF ALEXANDER'S BRIDGE AND THE BARREL ORGAN BY WILLA CATHER AND ALFRED NOYES
ISN'T IT FINE THEY ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS DEAR
SHE MUST FEEL HOW USELESS IT WOULD BE TO STIR ABOUT THAT SHE MAY AS WELL SIT STILL
I EXPECTED HIM HERE FOR LUNCHEON THOSE TRAINS FROM ALBANY ARE ALWAYS LATE
SOME OF THE MEN JUMPED AND SOME RAN TRYING TO MAKE THE SHORE
THE SKY WAS ALREADY A PALE BLUE AND OF THE CLEARNESS OF CRYSTAL
THE STREETS WERE FULL OF PEOPLE WHO HAD WORKED INDOORS ALL THROUGH THE PRICELESS DAY AND HAD NOW COME HUNGRILY OUT TO DRINK THE MUDDY LEES OF IT
THE BRIDGE SEEMED LONGER THAN IT HAD EVER SEEMED BEFORE AND HE WAS GLAD WHEN HE FELT THE BEAT OF THE WHEELS ON THE SOLID ROADBED AGAIN
HOW FINE IT ALL IS SHE LAUGHED AS IF SHE WERE PLEASED
I KEPT THINKING OF THAT
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT SHE'D DO ANYTHING
TRULY I DON'T
IN HIS SLEEP AS IF IT HAD NOTHING FRESHER TO WORK UPON HIS MIND WENT BACK AND TORTURED ITSELF WITH SOMETHING YEARS AND YEARS AWAY AN OLD LONG-FORGOTTEN SORROW OF HIS CHILDHOOD
AND IT PULSES THROUGH THE PLEASURES OF THE CITY AND THE PAIN THAT SURROUND THE SINGING ORGAN LIKE A LARGE ETERNAL LIGHT
I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT HE LOOKED AT HER AND HIS HAGGARD FACE SOFTENED
BUT ABOUT PARTICULAR DEFINITE PERSONAL THINGS,"--HERE SHE HAD THROWN HER HANDS UP TO HIS SHOULDERS WITH A QUICK IMPULSIVE GESTURE--"OH ABOUT THOSE I SHOULD BE VERY JEALOUS
ALEXANDER SAT DOWN ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR
I WAS AFRAID TO TAKE A CAB
THE SHAMEFULNESS OF YOUR ASKING ME TO DO THAT
I'M TIRED OF WORK TIRED OF PEOPLE TIRED OF TRAILING ABOUT HE LOOKED OUT AT THE STORM-BEATEN RIVER
AND SHE NEVER FAILED HERSELF
THEY'VE BEEN AWFULLY HAPPY ONES ALL OF THEM HAVEN'T THEY HE TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS AND BENT BACK LIFTING HER A LITTLE AND GIVING HER A LONG KISS
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND MY KNOWING ABOUT IT HILDA
WHEN DID YOU FIRST BEGIN TO FEEL LIKE THIS BARTLEY AFTER THE VERY FIRST
AND HE COULD EVEN LET IT GO HE TOLD HIMSELF
YES IT'S VERY VERY PRETTY
DON'T LEAVE ME TO THE DREAD OF FINDING OUT THINGS THAT PEOPLE MAY BE SAYING
THERE'S A BARREL-ORGAN CAROLING ACROSS A GOLDEN STREET IN THE CITY AS THE SUN SINKS GLITTERING AND SLOW
OH BARTLEY THAT OLD FOOLISHNESS ABOUT MY BEING HARD
IT'S HELD UP BY A STEEL STRIKE
DINING LATE TO SHORTEN THE NIGHT SLEEPING LATE TO SHORTEN THE DAY
SHE WOULD NEVER LET HIM GIVE HER ANYTHING ELSE
WELL HE REMARKED WHEN HE WAS BIDDEN TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF THERE WAS A LONG MORNING WITH THE PSYCHOLOGISTS LUNCHEON WITH BARTLEY AT HIS CLUB MORE PSYCHOLOGISTS AND HERE I AM
SUDDENLY HE REMEMBERED WHAT IT WAS
HE WONDERED HOW A WOMAN WITH SO MANY DUTIES HAD MANAGED TO KEEP HERSELF UP TO A STANDARD REALLY PROFESSIONAL
HE FOUND IT A DELIGHTFUL LITTLE PLACE AND HE MET CHARMING PEOPLE THERE
I WRITE ALL THIS BECAUSE I CAN NEVER TELL IT TO YOU AND BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS IF I COULD NOT KEEP SILENT ANY LONGER
WHEN HE WROTE HER THAT EVERYTHING WAS CHANGED FOR HIM HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH
HE LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE AGASSIZ AND HIS WIFE IN HER OLD-FASHIONED BLACK SILK DRESS OVERSKIRTED AND TIGHT-SLEEVED REMINDED ALEXANDER OF THE EARLY PICTURES OF MRS BROWNING
WE WALKED DOWN TO THE PLACE SAINT-MICHEL TO BUY SOME LILACS
AGAIN HE HEARD THE SAME SOUND LIKE A FIRM LIGHT TAP
`MACKELLER FOUND HIM SOWING WILD OATS IN LONDON I BELIEVE
THAT WAS HIS REPLY TO THE QUESTION PUT BY THE MOUNTAINS AND THE STARS
WHEN ALEXANDER WALKED BACK TO HIS HOTEL THE RED AND GREEN LIGHTS WERE BLINKING ALONG THE DOCKS ON THE FARTHER SHORE AND THE SOFT WHITE STARS WERE SHINING IN THE WIDE SKY ABOVE THE RIVER
IT WAS BY ITS ENERGY THAT THIS NEW FEELING GOT THE BETTER OF HIM
THEY DON'T TALK OF ANY ONE ELSE AS THEY DO OF YOU HILDA SAT DOWN ON THE COUCH AND SAID SERIOUSLY
NO THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T DO
SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
COME IN HE SAID TO HILDA AT LAST AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER
HAVEN'T I SEEN IN THE PAPERS THAT THERE IS SOME TROUBLE ABOUT A TIDEWATER BRIDGE OF YOURS IN NEW JERSEY OH THAT DOESN'T AMOUNT TO ANYTHING
YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
LONDON HAD WAKENED TO LIFE AFTER THREE WEEKS OF COLD AND SODDEN RAIN
MACCONNELL TOOK HER HAND AND TUCKED IT SNUGLY UNDER HIS ARM
I WAS GOING TO SHOW YOU A PICTURE
HILDA SAW ALEXANDER LOOK UP AT IT
ALEXANDER HIMSELF REMAINED STANDING WHERE THEY HAD BEEN WORKING LOOKING ABOUT HIM
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW GLAD I AM TO HAVE YOU SO PRETTY AND COMFORTABLE HERE AND TO HEAR EVERY ONE SAYING SUCH NICE THINGS ABOUT YOU
YOU WORK LIKE THE DEVIL AND THINK YOU'RE GETTING ON AND SUDDENLY YOU DISCOVER THAT YOU'VE ONLY BEEN GETTING YOURSELF TIED UP
THIS ISN'T FAIR YOU KNOW
AS IF YOU NEEDED ME FOR THAT
TELL THOMAS TO GET EVERYTHING READY WHEN ALEXANDER REAPPEARED HE TOOK HIS WIFE'S ARM AND WENT WITH HER INTO THE LIBRARY
BUT I AM NEVER AT PEACE
YOU FELT IT WASN'T WHOLLY FAIR TO HIM WILSON SHOOK HIMSELF AND READJUSTED HIS GLASSES
THE MOMENT HE STEPPED ALMOST OUT OF BREATH BEHIND THE SHELTER OF THE STERN THE WIND WAS CUT OFF AND HE FELT LIKE A RUSH OF WARM AIR A SENSE OF CLOSE AND INTIMATE COMPANIONSHIP
SHE'S APT TO GROW A BIT STALE AFTER A TIME
YOU KNOW LORD WESTMERE OF COURSE,--THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOWLE
SHE UNDERWENT IT
WHEN HE WENT ABOVE THE WIND HAD RISEN AND THE DECK WAS ALMOST DESERTED
HORTON HIMSELF WAS ALMOST AS DEEPLY PERPLEXED
I'VE HAD NO EXERCISE TO-DAY AND ALL THIS HAS MADE ME NERVOUS I SHOULDN'T WONDER SAID MACCONNELL DRYLY
AND IT WAS IN CANADA THAT YOU MET YOUR WIFE WASN'T IT YES AT ALLWAY
HE HAD SEVERAL BRIDGES UNDER WAY IN THE UNITED STATES AND THEY WERE ALWAYS BEING HELD UP BY STRIKES AND DELAYS RESULTING FROM A GENERAL INDUSTRIAL UNREST
I KEEP REMEMBERING LOCOED HORSES I USED TO SEE ON THE RANGE WHEN I WAS A BOY
I WANT TO GO AND LIVE OUT HIS POTENTIALITIES TOO
I HOPE SO HE WAS LOOKING AT HER ROUND SLENDER FIGURE AS SHE STOOD BY THE PIANO TURNING OVER A PILE OF MUSIC AND HE FELT THE ENERGY IN EVERY LINE OF IT
HILDA LEANED BACK IN HER CHAIR WATCHING HIM INDULGENTLY OUT OF HER SHREWD EYES
THAT FORBIDDING PILE WAS THE GOAL OF HER TRUANT FANCY AND SHE WAS SOMETIMES TAKEN THERE FOR A TREAT AS OTHER CHILDREN ARE TAKEN TO THE THEATRE
THERE'S A THIEF PERHAPS THAT LISTENS WITH A FACE OF FROZEN STONE IN THE CITY AS THE SUN SINKS LOW
IT HAD COME OUT OF THE DEPTHS OF THE POOR CREATURE'S SORROW VIBRATING WITH PITY FOR THEIR YOUTH AND DESPAIR AT THE TERRIBLENESS OF HUMAN LIFE
HE HAD A LONG TALK WITH MACCONNELL BUT HE GOT NO WORD WITH HILDA ALONE AND HE LEFT IN A DISCONTENTED STATE OF MIND
IT'S THE WHOLE THING THAT TROUBLES ME HILDA
BUT INSTEAD HE TOOK THE BOAT TRAIN FOR LONDON
DISSECTS THE COMMON CARNIVAL OF PASSIONS AND REGRETS
HILDA SHIVERED AND SAT STILL
ARE YOU BUSY THIS MORNING HILDA HE ASKED AS HE SAT DOWN HIS HAT AND GLOVES IN HIS HAND
EVEN AFTER YOU BEGAN TO CLIMB I STOOD DOWN IN THE CROWD AND WATCHED YOU WITH--WELL NOT WITH CONFIDENCE
ONE OF YOUR COUNTRYMEN ALEXANDER BY THE WAY
THERE IS A LETTER FOR YOU THERE IN MY DESK DRAWER
WHAT A STRONG BROWN FACE SHE HAD AND VERY TRAGIC
HE WISHED HE COULD PROMISE THEM BETTER LUCK
AT THE SIGHT OF THESE THE SUPERCILIOUS ANGORA MOVED RESTLESSLY QUITTED HER RED CUSHION BY THE FIRE AND CAME UP WAVING HER TAIL IN VEXATION AT THESE OMINOUS INDICATIONS OF CHANGE
IT NEVER GETS ANY EASIER WINIFRED THEY BOTH STARTED AT THE SOUND OF THE CARRIAGE ON THE PAVEMENT OUTSIDE
THEY WERE TOO MUCH CONFUSED TO SAY ANYTHING AS THEY WENT DOWN THE HILL
BARTLEY ROSE AND RANG THE BELL
PEOPLE NOTICED HIS PROPENSITY FOR WALKING IN ROUGH WEATHER AND WATCHED HIM CURIOUSLY AS HE DID HIS ROUNDS
HE WAS NEVER SO WITTY OR SO SHARP HERE AS ELSEWHERE AND ALEXANDER THOUGHT HE BEHAVED AS IF HE WERE AN ELDERLY RELATIVE COME IN TO A YOUNG GIRL'S PARTY
IT'S POSITIVELY UNSAFE FOR YOU TO BE OUT ALONE
WHEN ALEXANDER REACHED THE LIBRARY DOOR HE SWITCHED ON THE LIGHTS AND STOOD SIX FEET AND MORE IN THE ARCHWAY GLOWING WITH STRENGTH AND CORDIALITY AND RUGGED BLOND GOOD LOOKS
TALL AND THIN WITH HIGH HITCHING SHOULDERS AND A SMALL HEAD GLISTENING WITH CLOSELY BRUSHED YELLOW HAIR
HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF
WHEN HE WENT ON DECK THE SKY WAS BLUE AND BLINDING WITH HEAVY WHIFFS OF WHITE CLOUD SMOKE-COLORED AT THE EDGES MOVING RAPIDLY ACROSS IT
THERE WAS LITERALLY A TASTE OF LIFE ON HIS LIPS AS HE SAT DOWN TO DINNER AND ORDERED A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE
OUTSIDE THERE WERE WINDOW BOXES PAINTED WHITE AND FULL OF FLOWERS
I SHALL SAVE TWO DAYS CHAPTER II ON THE NIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL IN LONDON ALEXANDER WENT IMMEDIATELY TO THE HOTEL ON THE EMBANKMENT AT WHICH HE ALWAYS STOPPED AND IN THE LOBBY HE WAS ACCOSTED BY AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE MAURICE MAINHALL WHO FELL UPON HIM WITH EFFUSIVE CORDIALITY AND INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO DINE WITH HIM
HE GOT A BLURRED IMPRESSION OF HER FINE COLOR THE VIOLETS SHE WORE HER WHITE GLOVES AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH OF HER VEIL AS SHE TURNED UP A FLIGHT OF STEPS IN FRONT OF HIM AND DISAPPEARED
WHEN DID YOU STOP WORK HE ASKED SHARPLY
EVEN HALF-INDIFFERENT SIGHTSEERS DROPPED THEIR VOICES AS THEY TOLD A NEWCOMER
DON'T BE AFRAID TO TELL ME THE WORST MR HORTON
ALEXANDER TRIED TO BEAT THEM OFF BUT THERE WERE TOO MANY OF THEM
SHALL YOU WEAR YELLOW GOWNS
GOOD-NIGHT
I WISH THINGS WOULD LET ME REST
IT'S OWING TO THAT SAME CHANCE BY THE WAY THAT I AM ABLE TO ASK YOU TO DINNER
AND HE HAD BEEN A FOOL BEFORE
BUT YOU DID AFTER ALL ENJOY BEING AT HOME AGAIN OH YES
I'D NEVER HAVE ANOTHER HOUR'S PEACE IF I HELPED TO MAKE YOU DO A THING LIKE THAT HE TOOK HER FACE BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND LOOKED DOWN INTO IT
HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT IN AWKWARD CONSTRAINT HIS PIPE IN HIS HAND
OH FAIR ENOUGH
SHE'LL BE AS GLAD TO SEE YOU
THEY WERE ALL LAUGHING AND BENDING TOWARD HER
MORE THAN I HAVE
SHE GOT OFF THE TRAIN THIS MORNING
ONE IMMEDIATELY TOOK FOR GRANTED THE COSTLY PRIVILEGES AND FINE SPACES THAT MUST LIE IN THE BACKGROUND FROM WHICH SUCH A FIGURE COULD EMERGE WITH THIS RAPID AND ELEGANT GAIT
HE HAD AWAKENED WITH ALL HIS OLD SENSE OF POWER
I LIKE IT
UGH ALL THE SAME I BELIEVE SHE USED TO FEEL IT WHEN WE STOOD THERE AND WATCHED HER AND WISHED HER WELL
WHY NOT THAT LITTLE FRENCH PLACE IN SOHO WHERE WE WENT SO OFTEN WHEN YOU WERE HERE IN THE SUMMER
GO IN AND GET DRY THINGS ON AT ONCE
IT WAS AGREEABLE TO COME TO HIMSELF AGAIN AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF NUMBNESS AND TORPOR
COME WE'LL HAVE OUR COFFEE IN THE OTHER ROOM AND YOU CAN SMOKE HILDA ROSE QUICKLY AS IF SHE WISHED TO CHANGE THE DRIFT OF THEIR TALK BUT BARTLEY FOUND IT PLEASANT TO CONTINUE IT
SHE STOOD OVER HIM WITH HER HANDS CLENCHED AT HER SIDE HER BODY RIGID
DID YOU SUPPOSE I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SAILING ON TUESDAY
IN A WAY HE REALLY IS THERE
AS HE LIFTED HER IN HIS TWO HANDS HE WHISPERED
I REMEMBER HOW SHE SAVED AND SCRAPED FOR HIM AND HOW HE ALWAYS LAY ABED TILL TEN O'CLOCK
ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY
I'LL GO UPSTAIRS AND CHANGE MY COAT
SUDDENLY HE BROKE OUT
IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER AND MIGHT BE SO GOOD FOR THEM IF SHE COULD LET OTHER PEOPLE IN PERHAPS SHE'S AFRAID OF LETTING HIM OUT A LITTLE OF SHARING HIM WITH SOMEBODY WILSON PUT DOWN HIS CUP AND LOOKED UP WITH VAGUE ALARM
A MOST REMARKABLE OLD LADY
THERE WAS NO SHOCK OF ANY KIND
THE QUIET HILLS SLEEPING IN THE MOONLIGHT THE SLENDER SKELETON OF THE BRIDGE REACHING OUT INTO THE RIVER AND UP YONDER ALONE ON THE HILL THE BIG WHITE HOUSE
SHE CAUGHT HIS HANDKERCHIEF FROM HER THROAT AND THRUST IT AT HIM WITHOUT TURNING ROUND
CAN YOU COME UP AT ONCE
WILSON FOLLOWED AND HAVING SEEN HER SEATED DROPPED INTO A CHAIR BEHIND HER
WHILE THEY SAT AT DINNER MAINHALL ACQUAINTED BARTLEY WITH THE FORTUNES OF HIS OLD FRIENDS IN LONDON AND AS THEY LEFT THE TABLE HE PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD GO TO SEE HUGH MACCONNELL'S NEW COMEDY BOG LIGHTS IT'S REALLY QUITE THE BEST THING MACCONNELL'S DONE HE EXPLAINED AS THEY GOT INTO A HANSOM
COME INTO THE LIBRARY
WHY WAS HE GOING TO LONDON
HE HAD EXPECTED THAT SUCCESS WOULD BRING HIM FREEDOM AND POWER
EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
WITH ONE HE THREW DOWN THE WINDOW AND WITH THE OTHER--STILL STANDING BEHIND HER--HE DREW HER BACK AGAINST HIM
THEORETICALLY IT WORKED OUT WELL ENOUGH BUT IT HAD NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN TRIED ALEXANDER PUT ON HIS OVERCOAT AND TOOK THE SUPERINTENDENT BY THE ARM
THERE WAS NOTHING HORRIBLE ABOUT IT
ALEXANDER HEARD LITTLE OF THE STORY BUT HE WATCHED HILDA INTENTLY
ONE CAUGHT HIM ABOUT THE NECK ANOTHER GRIPPED HIM ABOUT THE MIDDLE AND THEY WENT DOWN TOGETHER
BUT IF YOU COME TO ME I'LL DO AS I SEE FIT
HE FELT THAT HE HAD NOT COME OUT OF IT VERY BRILLIANTLY
OH MAC HOW GLAD I AM
AT BOTTOM YOU REALLY LIKE ALL THESE THINGS
SHE LOOKED AT US WITH SUCH DESPAIR AND LONGING OUT FROM UNDER HER BLACK SHAWL
SOMETIMES OF LATE I'VE THOUGHT YOU LOOKED AS IF YOU WERE TROUBLED NO
WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE-BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE SCENE BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
HE HAD VEXATIONS ENOUGH TOO WITH HIS WORK AT HOME
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF MOLLY HAD BEEN HERE FOR I REMEMBER YOU DON'T LIKE ENGLISH COOKERY ALEXANDER WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM LOOKING AT EVERYTHING
YET ALL THE TIME UNDERNEATH HIS PLEASURE AND HOPEFULNESS AND SATISFACTION HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE VIBRATION OF AN UNNATURAL EXCITEMENT
SHE UTTERED A LITTLE CRY THREW HER ARMS OVER HER HEAD AND DREW HIS FACE DOWN TO HERS
AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
HIS WIFE WILSON SURMISED HAD CHOSEN IT
HE DID NOT LIKE COMING AND GOING ACROSS THAT BRIDGE OR REMEMBERING THE MAN WHO BUILT IT
WHEN ALEXANDER RETURNED TO HIS HOTEL--HE SHOOK MAINHALL AT THE DOOR OF THE THEATRE--HE HAD SOME SUPPER BROUGHT UP TO HIS ROOM AND IT WAS LATE BEFORE HE WENT TO BED
I CAN'T HELP IT SHE ADDED FIERCELY
BUT I MUST GO DOWN NOW
HEAVEN KNOWS HOW SHE MANAGED TO KEEP IT WHOLE THROUGH ALL OUR WANDERINGS OR IN WHAT BASKETS AND BUNDLES AND THEATRE TRUNKS IT HASN'T BEEN STOWED AWAY
NO CREATURE EVER WANTED SO MUCH TO LIVE
YOU MAY NOT GET ANOTHER DAY LIKE THIS ALL WINTER
CURIOUS HE THOUGHT
HE WAS NEVER INTROSPECTIVE
IT'S A FINE BRAVE YOUTH I CARRY INSIDE ME ONLY HE'LL NEVER BE SEEN NONSENSE MAC
AFTER THE BREAK OF ONE FINE DAY THE WEATHER WAS PRETTY CONSISTENTLY DULL
HE AND MISS BURGOYNE HAD BEEN FAST FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME
AT LAST ALEXANDER BROUGHT OUT ONE WORD EVERYTHING HILDA WAS PALE BY THIS TIME AND HER EYES WERE WIDE WITH FRIGHT
HIS OLD PUPIL ALWAYS STIMULATED HIM AT FIRST AND THEN VASTLY WEARIED HIM
IT'S BUY A BUNCH OF VIOLETS FOR THE LADY IT'S LILAC TIME IN LONDON
COULD YOU--COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE
THOMAS HAS GOT THE WHITE ONE IN MY ROOM I TOLD HIM TO PUT IT THERE BUT I SAY IT'S MUCH THE FINEST OF THE LOT THAT'S WHY I HAD IT PUT THERE
HE WAS HIMSELF AND THERE WAS SOMETHING TO BE DONE
IT WAS FURNISHED WITH THE CAST-OFF POSSESSIONS OF HIS BACHELOR DAYS AND WITH ODD THINGS WHICH HE SHELTERED FOR FRIENDS OF HIS WHO FOLLOWED ITINERANT AND MORE OR LESS ARTISTIC CALLINGS
MACKELLER WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF MRS PEMBERTON WINIFRED'S AUNT
WINIFRED LOOKED FROM THE BOX TO BARTLEY AND EXCLAIMED WHERE DID YOU EVER FIND SUCH GOLD WORK BARTLEY IT'S OLD FLEMISH
AMERICAN TOURS HAVE SPOILED THEM I'M AFRAID
HORTON KEPT REPEATING THAT HE WAS SURE THERE COULD BE NOTHING WRONG WITH THE ESTIMATES
OF COURSE SHE SAID I NOW AND AGAIN HEAR STORIES ABOUT THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHEN HE WAS IN COLLEGE BUT THAT ISN'T WHAT YOU WANT WILSON WRINKLED HIS BROWS AND LOOKED AT HER WITH THE SMILING FAMILIARITY THAT HAD COME ABOUT SO QUICKLY
I CARRIED IT ALL LIGHTLY ENOUGH AT FIRST BUT NOW I DON'T DARE TRIFLE WITH IT
WHEN HILDA ROSE HE SAT DOWN ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND DREW HER BACK INTO IT
THEY'RE OOZING WATER HE KNELT DOWN AND BEGAN TO UNLACE HER SHOES WHILE HILDA SHRANK INTO THE CHAIR
HORTON PUT OUT HIS HAND AS IF TO HOLD HER BACK AND SPOKE PLEADINGLY
AND I HOPE HE WON'T BE TIRED TONIGHT
HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAMED FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAINHALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT
HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THINGS WERE AS BAD WITH HIM AS THEY HAD SEEMED LAST NIGHT THAT THERE WAS NO WAY TO SET THEM ENTIRELY RIGHT
NO PAST NO FUTURE FOR BARTLEY
HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND GAVE HIMSELF UP TO THE FEELING OF RAPID MOTION AND TO SWIFT TERRIFYING THOUGHTS
AS IF I WERE NOT ALWAYS INTERESTED HILDA EXCLAIMED
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS IN THE WEST,--OLD PEOPLE ARE POKED OUT OF THE WAY
HE WILL GO ON GETTING MEASURELESS SATISFACTION OUT OF YOU BY HIS STUDY FIRE
YOU SEE HE MURMURED IN ALEXANDER'S EAR AS THE CURTAIN FELL ON THE FIRST ACT ONE ALMOST NEVER SEES A PART LIKE THAT DONE WITHOUT SMARTNESS OR MAWKISHNESS
THE HANSOM MUST HAVE BEEN ONE THAT SHE EMPLOYED REGULARLY FOR SHE DID NOT STOP TO PAY THE DRIVER
I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO
I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT
I NEVER KNOW WHAT REPLY TO MAKE WILSON CHUCKLED AND LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR SHAKING HIS LEFT FOOT GENTLY
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN THAT YOU WOULD EXACTLY FADE DIM EVEN IF BARTLEY WERE HERE MRS ALEXANDER LAUGHED RELENTINGLY
MAINHALL HAD TOLD HIM THAT SHE WOULD PROBABLY BE THERE
THEN AS HE WAS CUTTING OFF A LENGTH OF STRING HE SIGHED SUDDENLY AND SAT DOWN STARING OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE SNOW
I HAVEN'T STOPPED WORK YET MR ALEXANDER
WILL YOU BUTTON MY GLOVES FOR ME BARTLEY TOOK HER WRIST AND BEGAN TO BUTTON THE LONG GRAY SUEDE GLOVE
SHALL WE HAVE TEA NOW
NO SCARCELY THAT
I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY
THE HOUSE A COMFORTABLE WELL-KEPT PLACE ENOUGH WAS DARK EXCEPT FOR THE FOUR FRONT WINDOWS ON THE SECOND FLOOR WHERE A LOW EVEN LIGHT WAS BURNING BEHIND THE WHITE MUSLIN SASH CURTAINS
HE CAUGHT HIS BREATH AND THEN SHE LET HIM GO
PRESENTLY HE HAILED A TALL BEARDED MAN GRIM-BROWED AND RATHER BATTERED-LOOKING WHO HAD HIS OPERA CLOAK ON HIS ARM AND HIS HAT IN HIS HAND AND WHO SEEMED TO BE ON THE POINT OF LEAVING THE THEATRE
IT WAS IN BOSTON I LINGERED LONGEST AH YOU SAW MRS ALEXANDER OFTEN
IT ISN'T FAR FROM LONDON AND YOU SHALL WANDER HAND IN HAND WITH LOVE IN SUMMER'S WONDERLAND
IT ISN'T FAR FROM LONDON AND YOU SHALL WANDER HAND IN HAND WITH LOVE IN SUMMER'S WONDERLAND
IT ISN'T FAR FROM LONDON AND YOU SHALL WANDER HAND IN HAND WITH LOVE IN SUMMER'S WONDERLAND
IT ISN'T FAR FROM LONDON AND YOU SHALL WANDER HAND IN HAND WITH LOVE IN SUMMER'S WONDERLAND
I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO-NIGHT ISN'T SHE SIR HARRY WRINKLED HIS BROWS JUDICIOUSLY
EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF-PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
ALMOST AS IF HE WERE THERE
YES I WAS THEN
WHAT A MAN HE IS FOR LOOKING ON AT LIFE BARTLEY SIGHED PUSHED THE LETTERS BACK IMPATIENTLY AND WENT OVER TO THE WINDOW
WON'T YOU JOIN US HERE MISS BURGOYNE WAS JUST TELLING US ABOUT A DONKEY-BOY SHE HAD IN GALWAY LAST SUMMER SIR HARRY TOWNE EXPLAINED AS THE CIRCLE CLOSED UP AGAIN
AND HE THREW IT BACK AT ME A SECOND TIME SHE FELT THE STRENGTH LEAP IN THE ARMS THAT HELD HER SO LIGHTLY
HE INTENDED DURING THE VOYAGE TO DECIDE UPON A COURSE OF ACTION BUT HE HELD ALL THIS AWAY FROM HIM FOR THE PRESENT AND LAY IN A BLESSED GRAY OBLIVION
AND TELL HER SHE'S YOUR OWN TRUE LOVE
I WON'T PROMISE
YOU HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE SOME BIRDS IN THE BUSHES
THE EDITOR OF A MONTHLY REVIEW CAME WITH HIS WIFE AND LADY KILDARE THE IRISH PHILANTHROPIST BROUGHT HER YOUNG NEPHEW ROBERT OWEN WHO HAD COME UP FROM OXFORD AND WHO WAS VISIBLY EXCITED AND GRATIFIED BY HIS FIRST INTRODUCTION TO MISS BURGOYNE
WON'T YOU DRIVE UP TO MY HOUSE MRS ALEXANDER
YOU'LL VISIT ME OFTEN WON'T YOU EVERY DAY IN THE CALENDAR
I KNEW THEN THAT YOUR PATHS WERE NOT TO BE PATHS OF PEACE BUT I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO FOLLOW THEM BARTLEY AND HIS WIFE STOOD SILENT FOR A LONG TIME
THEY WENT HOME SADLY WITH THE LILACS BACK TO THE RUE SAINT-JACQUES WALKING VERY SLOWLY ARM IN ARM
BARTLEY YOU'RE COWARDLY ALEXANDER ROSE AND SHOOK HIMSELF ANGRILY
HE TALKED DELIGHTFULLY TO THE OLDER ONES AND PLAYED ACCOMPANIMENTS FOR THE YOUNGER ONES UNTIL THE LAST SLEEPY GIRL HAD FOLLOWED HER MOTHER BELOW
HIS HOUSE TO-NIGHT WOULD BE FULL OF CHARMING PEOPLE WHO LIKED AND ADMIRED HIM
ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HILDA
ALL HIS COMPANIONS IN THE DAY-COACH WERE EITHER DOZING OR SLEEPING HEAVILY AND THE MURKY LAMPS WERE TURNED LOW
THOMAS WILL SHOW YOU YOUR ROOM
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THAT MADE HILDA WISH HERSELF AT HER HOTEL AGAIN IN THE STREET BELOW ANYWHERE BUT WHERE SHE WAS
WHEN THEY WERE SEATED IN THE CARRIAGE ALEXANDER BEGAN TO QUESTION HIS ASSISTANT FURTHER
SHE WAS A DAFT GENEROUS LITTLE THING
THREE THOUSAND YEARS
ALEXANDER BROUGHT A CHAIR FOR HER BUT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD
I SENT ONE SUNDAY EVENING TO THE SAME ADDRESS BUT IT WAS RETURNED TO ME HAVE YOU A CARRIAGE OUT THERE
I CAN REMEMBER HOW I USED TO FEEL THERE HOW BEAUTIFUL EVERYTHING ABOUT ME WAS AND WHAT LIFE AND POWER AND FREEDOM I FELT IN MYSELF
THEY'RE ALREADY NERVOUS HORTON TELLS ME AND THERE'S NO USE ALARMING THEM
WILSON LEANED FORWARD
BUT YOU DON'T ALWAYS SHE LOOKED EARNESTLY AND INQUIRINGLY INTO HIS EYES
THE YOUNG ENGINEER LOOKED CONFUSED
I SOMEHOW BELIEVED THAT I COULD TAKE ALL THE BAD CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU
IF YOU ARE GOING WITH ME I THINK I'D RATHER WALK
HIS SPIRITS ROSE WITH EVERY STEP AND WHEN HE REACHED TRAFALGAR SQUARE BLAZING IN THE SUN WITH ITS FOUNTAINS PLAYING AND ITS COLUMN REACHING UP INTO THE BRIGHT AIR HE SIGNALED TO A HANSOM AND BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TOLD THE DRIVER TO GO TO BEDFORD SQUARE BY WAY OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM
UNDER THE MOON UNDER THE COLD SPLENDID STARS THERE WERE ONLY THOSE TWO THINGS AWAKE AND SLEEPLESS
THAT IS HIS ONE ACTIVITY
LAST NIGHT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED THAT ANYTHING COULD BE SO PLEASANT AS THE COLD WATER HE DASHED OVER HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS AND THE FRESHNESS OF CLEAN LINEN ON HIS BODY
THAT'S WHY I GOT SO STIRRED UP
EVEN IF YOU HAVE AT LAST TO PUT ME IN THE MUMMY-ROOM WITH THE OTHERS
BUT AT ANY RATE I NEEDED YOU
THE DECKS SMELLED OF DAMP WOOLENS AND THE AIR WAS SO HUMID THAT DROPS OF MOISTURE KEPT GATHERING UPON HIS HAIR AND MUSTACHE
I MUST HAVE YOU TO THINK OF THROUGH THE MONTHS AND MONTHS OF LONELINESS
AND YOU HAVE SO MANY FLOWERS
TELL HIM NOT TO FORGET THE BIG PORTFOLIO ON THE STUDY TABLE THOMAS WITHDREW CLOSING THE DOOR SOFTLY
HE HAD SLIPPED ON A PURPLE VELVET SMOKING-COAT
AS HE STOOD THERE HE HAD A FEELING THAT HE WOULD NEVER ESCAPE
YOU ARE--POWERFUL CHAPTER VIII THE LAST REHEARSAL WAS OVER A TEDIOUS DRESS REHEARSAL WHICH HAD LASTED ALL DAY AND EXHAUSTED THE PATIENCE OF EVERY ONE WHO HAD TO DO WITH IT
I DARE SAY IT'S QUITE TRUE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ONE ELSE MAINHALL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
HE'S SAFE BACK AT HIS GRIND AND SAYS HE HAD A BULLY TIME
AUNT ELEANOR WAS VERY WORLDLY IN A FRANK EARLY-VICTORIAN MANNER
WHEN THE GRANDEUR AND BEAUTY OF THE WORLD CHALLENGED HIM--AS IT CHALLENGES EVEN THE MOST SELF-ABSORBED PEOPLE--HE ALWAYS ANSWERED WITH HER NAME
PERHAPS SHE HAS ME TO THANK FOR SOMETHING AFTER ALL
HE WILL SEE BY THE PAPERS THAT WE ARE COMING
NONE OF THE THINGS HE HAD GAINED IN THE LEAST COMPENSATED
ED I HAVE PLACED IT AT THE END FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE SEEMS GOOD TO GET BACK DOESN'T IT BARTLEY WHISPERED AS THEY DROVE FROM BAYSWATER ROAD INTO OXFORD STREET
GOING OVER TO THE WINDOW HE LOOKED OUT AT THE LIGHTS ACROSS THE RIVER
THERE WAS A SMELL OF ACACIAS IN THE AIR EVERYWHERE AND THE LABURNUMS WERE DRIPPING GOLD OVER THE WALLS OF THE GARDENS
WE MAKE THE MOST OF OUR MOMENT SHE THRUST HER LITTLE CHIN OUT DEFIANTLY OVER HER GRAY FUR COLLAR AND BARTLEY LOOKED DOWN AT HER AND LAUGHED
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS REALLY LIKE WHEN HE WAS A BOY
HER BEING THERE SO OFTEN HAD MADE HIM FEEL THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HER AND AS SHE WAS NOT AN INACCESSIBLE PERSON AN INTRODUCTION WAS NOT DIFFICULT
ALEXANDER HAD FINISHED HIS COFFEE AND WAS PACING UP AND DOWN
ALTHOUGH MAINHALL'S ENTHUSIASM WAS OFTEN TIRESOME AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS OFTEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACTS AND VIVID FIGMENTS OF HIS IMAGINATION HIS IMPERTURBABLE GOOD NATURE OVERCAME EVEN THE PEOPLE WHOM HE BORED MOST SO THAT THEY ENDED BY BECOMING IN A RELUCTANT MANNER HIS FRIENDS
IT'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO-NIGHT MAC
I AM IN MY OWN HOUSE IN MY OWN STUDY IN THE MIDST OF ALL THESE QUIET STREETS WHERE MY FRIENDS LIVE
AND I'VE GOT NOBODY BUT YOU
BARTLEY BREAKFASTED HURRIEDLY AND WENT OVER HIS MAIL WHILE THE HOTEL VALET PACKED HIS TRUNKS
HE SEEMED TO SEE HIMSELF DRAGGING OUT A RESTLESS EXISTENCE ON THE CONTINENT--CANNES HYERES ALGIERS CAIRO--AMONG SMARTLY DRESSED DISABLED MEN OF EVERY NATIONALITY
SHE WAS A WONDERFUL OLD LADY LIKE HER NIECE WILSON QUERIED
THE CLOCK TICKED THROUGH THE MINUTES OF A HALF-HOUR AND THE AFTERNOON OUTSIDE BEGAN TO THICKEN AND DARKEN TURBIDLY
EVERY ONE AT LADY WALFORD'S WAS LOOKING AT IT HILDA CURTSIED
BUT HE'S GIVEN ME SOME GOOD IRISH SONGS
BUT I HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH OF IT HERE SHE DREW A PORTFOLIO FROM BEHIND A BOOKCASE
I HAD SUCH A CLEAR PICTURE OF IT
HE DRANK IT APPRECIATIVELY AND REMARKED THAT THERE WAS STILL NO OTHER HE LIKED SO WELL
MR ALEXANDER
IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILDA
ALL THE MORNING PAPERS ARE ON THE TABLE HILDA WAS BACK IN A FEW MOMENTS WEARING A LONG GRAY SQUIRREL COAT AND A BROAD FUR HAT
HIS WIFE SAT AT THE TABLE WATCHING HIM
HER HAIR IS STILL LIKE FLAX AND HER BLUE EYES ARE JUST LIKE A BABY'S AND SHE HAS THE SAME THREE FRECKLES ON HER LITTLE NOSE AND TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO HER BAINS DE MER BARTLEY LOOKED AT HILDA ACROSS THE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE CANDLES AND BROKE INTO A LOW HAPPY LAUGH
WE SAT THERE EVENING AFTER EVENING IN THE QUIET OF THAT MAGICALLY HAUNTED ROOM AND WATCHED THE SUNSET BURN ON THE RIVER AND FELT HIM
THOUGH ALEXANDER OFTEN TOLD HIMSELF HE HAD NEVER PUT MORE INTO HIS WORK THAN HE HAD DONE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HE HAD TO ADMIT THAT HE HAD NEVER GOT SO LITTLE OUT OF IT
YES AND NO
BENNETT TOLD ME YESTERDAY THAT IT WAS DECIDED HILDA LOOKED UP DELIGHTEDLY AT THE TALL GRAY FIGURE BESIDE HER
EVEN IF HE WENT TO LONDON AT MIDSUMMER WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FOOL
WHEN DID THE AZALEAS GET HERE
REALLY PROFESSOR WILSON IT WOULD SEEM THAT HE GREW UP AMONG THE STRANGEST PEOPLE
YOU SEE YOU ARE DIFFERENT HILDA
SHE IS VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE AMERICAN ARTIST WHO DID THEM
HE LEFT AN ECHO
YOU HAVE ONLY TO LOOK AT IT TO FEEL THAT IT MEANT THE BEGINNING OF A GREAT CAREER
OH LET US GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY HE SAID LAUGHING
AFTER HE HAD DRESSED ALEXANDER SAT DOWN AT THE WINDOW AND DREW INTO HIS LUNGS DEEP BREATHS OF THE PINE-SCENTED AIR
SHE WAS TALLER THAN HORTON AND SOME OF THE MEN THOUGHT SHE WAS THE TALLEST WOMAN THEY HAD EVER SEEN
YOU MUST GO NOW BARTLEY
AH YOUR DEAR ARMS CHAPTER VII DURING THE FORTNIGHT THAT ALEXANDER WAS IN LONDON HE DROVE HIMSELF HARD
SHE HEARD HIM GIVE HIS NAME AND CAME FORWARD HOLDING OUT HER HAND
WE'VE HAD FIVE MILES OF `IL TROVATORE NOW
SIT DOWN HILDA
AND CERTAINLY THAT'S THE NEW LINE OF DEVELOPMENT ALEXANDER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND MADE NO REPLY
I'M GOING TO MARRY WHO OH IT DOESN'T MATTER MUCH
I WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE
SO SORRY I CAN'T SEE YOU
OTHERWISE I'D NEVER HAVE GOT ANYTHING GOOD SO EARLY
WE ARE TIRED OF TALK YES I BEG YOU MRS ALEXANDER WILSON BEGAN BUT HE GOT NO FURTHER
ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON HE CUT SHORT A COMMITTEE MEETING JUMPED INTO A HANSOM AND DROVE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
IT WAS AS A POWERFULLY EQUIPPED NATURE THAT I FOUND HIM INTERESTING
OR HAVE YOU LEARNED TO BE INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING
ALWAYS NOW IT BROUGHT WITH IT A SENSE OF QUICKENED LIFE OF STIMULATING DANGER
I WILL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY--BUT THAT
I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU
BUT AREN'T YOU FRIGHTFULLY EXTRAVAGANT NOT FOR CHRISTMAS-TIME
AND WAS HE INDEED THE SAME MAN WHO USED TO WALK THAT BRIDGE AT NIGHT PROMISING SUCH THINGS TO HIMSELF AND TO THE STARS
WITHOUT THAT HE REFLECTED SHE WOULD BE TOO COLD
I HAVE SOME CHAMPAGNE FOR YOU TOO
I'VE BEEN UP AND ABOUT THREE HOURS WORKING AT MY PART
HE GOT UP AND WENT OVER TO THE WINDOW THREW IT OPEN AND LEANED OUT
PICCADILLY WAS A STREAM OF RAPIDLY MOVING CARRIAGES FROM WHICH FLASHED FURS AND FLOWERS AND BRIGHT WINTER COSTUMES
ALWAYS AN INTERESTED OBSERVER OF WOMEN WILSON WOULD HAVE SLACKENED HIS PACE ANYWHERE TO FOLLOW THIS ONE WITH HIS IMPERSONAL APPRECIATIVE GLANCE
WHY CERTAINLY IF YOU WON'T FIND ME TOO NOISY
IT'S ABOMINABLE OF YOU TO ASK ME
HE HAD NOT HAD HIS CLOTHES OFF FOR THIRTY HOURS AND THE STIMULUS OF VIOLENT EXCITEMENT WAS BEGINNING TO WEAR OFF
THEY NEVER DID TO ME HILDA SMILED UP AT HIM BEAUTIFULLY AND PUT HER HAND ON HIS SLEEVE
HE HOPED SO
THE BRIDGES INTO THE FUTURE--I OFTEN SAY THAT TO MYSELF
I THINK PEOPLE WERE MEANT TO BE HAPPY A LITTLE SHE SAID
I'VE A NOTION TO CALL IT OFF
FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK HE WAS NERVOUS AND UNSETTLED AND KEPT RUSHING HIS WORK AS IF HE WERE PREPARING FOR IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE
GO DOWN TO KEW IN LILAC TIME
GO DOWN TO KEW IN LILAC TIME
HERE TAKE IT
AND THERE LA TRAVIATA SIGHTS ANOTHER SADDER SONG
THANK YOU MARIE
DO YOU KNOW I KEPT FEELING THAT HE MUST BE UP IN HIS STUDY THE PROFESSOR LOOKED REFLECTIVELY INTO THE GRATE
WHILE THE SKY BURNS BLUE ABOVE
THE GREAT OPEN SPACES MADE HIM PASSIVE AND THE RESTLESSNESS OF THE WATER QUIETED HIM
WHAT AM I TO DO HILDA THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SEE YOU ABOUT BARTLEY
YOU SAY THAT YOU BELIEVE THE LOWER CHORDS ARE SHOWING STRAIN AND THAT EVEN THE WORKMEN HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT AND YET YOU'VE GONE ON ADDING WEIGHT I'M SORRY MR ALEXANDER BUT I HAD COUNTED ON YOUR GETTING HERE YESTERDAY
SINCE YOU NOTICED SOMETHING MRS ALEXANDER WENT ON IT MUST HAVE BEEN A FLASH OF THE DISTRUST I HAVE COME TO FEEL WHENEVER I MEET ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW BARTLEY WHEN HE WAS A BOY
THE CARRIAGE STOOD THERE HOUR AFTER HOUR AND WORD SOON SPREAD AMONG THE CROWDS ON THE SHORE THAT ITS OCCUPANT WAS THE WIFE OF THE CHIEF ENGINEER
AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHERE WE STOPPED YESTERDAY PERFECTLY
YOU'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS AGAIN MARK ME
DON'T STIFFEN UP LIKE THAT
IN GOING TO HIS NEW BRIDGE AT MOORLOCK HE HAD ALWAYS TO PASS THROUGH ALLWAY
BUT DO YOU KNOW IT MADE ME FEEL AWKWARD TO BE HANGING ABOUT STILL SEVENTY
WELL WE ARE NEITHER OF US TWENTY NOW YOU KNOW
YOU SEE THAT CARRIAGE OVER THERE
I DON'T DRINK IT MYSELF BUT I LIKE TO SEE IT BEHAVE WHEN IT'S POURED
TOO BAD
WELL THEN I SHALL HANG
ON HIS RETURN HE HAD UNDERTAKEN THE BRIDGE AT MOORLOCK IN CANADA THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF BRIDGE-BUILDING GOING ON IN THE WORLD,--A TEST INDEED OF HOW FAR THE LATEST PRACTICE IN BRIDGE STRUCTURE COULD BE CARRIED
HE WAS NOT READY FOR IT
INDEED THEY SELDOM SPOKE OF HIM
IN HALF AN HOUR YOU ARE TO BRING THE GREENS UP FROM THE CELLAR AND PUT THEM IN THE LIBRARY
IN HIS FEELING FOR HIS WIFE THERE WAS ALL THE TENDERNESS ALL THE PRIDE ALL THE DEVOTION OF WHICH HE WAS CAPABLE
WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM THIS BOTH OF US
HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME REALLY TO EXPLAIN TO ME
HAPPINESS LIKE THAT MAKES ONE INSOLENT
THEY ARE ALL SAFE AND AT PEACE WITH THEMSELVES
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN HERE IN HIS OWN HOUSE AMONG THE THINGS HE LOVED
AS MAINHALL HAD SAID SHE WAS THE SECOND ACT
BUT ONCE IN THE LIGHT AND AIR HE KNEW HE SHOULD LIVE TO TELL HER AND TO RECOVER ALL HE HAD LOST
ALEXANDER WAS A STRONG SWIMMER BUT HE HAD GONE SCARCELY A DOZEN STROKES WHEN THE BRIDGE ITSELF WHICH HAD BEEN SETTLING FASTER AND FASTER CRASHED INTO THE WATER BEHIND HIM
OH YES I GO OVER TO PARIS OFTEN
HE FELT THAT HE HIMSELF WAS UNCHANGED THAT HE WAS STILL THERE THE SAME MAN HE HAD BEEN FIVE YEARS AGO AND THAT HE WAS SITTING STUPIDLY BY AND LETTING SOME RESOLUTE OFFSHOOT OF HIMSELF SPOIL HIS LIFE FOR HIM
MY LITTLE MARIE WORSHIPED HIM
ONCE MORE IL TROVATORE CRIES A TALE OF DEEPER WRONG
HE HEARD VOICES IN THE HALL BELOW AND KNEW THAT HE MUST GO DOWN
YOU SEE ONE CAN'T BE JEALOUS ABOUT THINGS IN GENERAL
YOU HAVE TRAVELED YOU SAY
THE STREET WAS QUIET DESERTED AND HUNG WITH A THIN BLUISH HAZE
DON'T BE ANY MORE ANGRY THAN YOU CAN HELP
WHEN THEY REACHED THE END OF THE RIVER SPAN ALEXANDER NODDED TO THE SUPERINTENDENT WHO QUIETLY GAVE AN ORDER TO THE FOREMAN
HE DISLIKED TO THINK OF HIS VISITS TO LONDON AS HOLIDAYS AND WHEN HE WAS THERE HE WORKED EVEN HARDER THAN HE DID AT HOME
HE WAS LATE IN FINISHING HIS DINNER AND DRANK RATHER MORE WINE THAN HE HAD MEANT TO
WHERE SHALL I TELL THE DRIVER
OR IT WAS THE SLIM OUTLINE OF A FAVORITE GREYHOUND HE USED TO HUNT JACK-RABBITS WITH WHEN HE WAS A BOY
ITS VERY COMPLETENESS IS A COMPENSATION
ACCORDING TO ALL HUMAN CALCULATIONS IT SIMPLY COULDN'T HAPPEN HORTON LEANED WEARILY AGAINST THE FRONT WHEEL OF THE CAB
NOW I KNOW THAT NO ONE CAN BUILD HIS SECURITY UPON THE NOBLENESS OF ANOTHER PERSON
IT ISN'T FAR FROM LONDON THE CHERRY-TREES ARE SEAS OF BLOOM AND SOFT PERFUME AND SWEET PERFUME THE CHERRY-TREES ARE SEAS OF BLOOM AND OH SO NEAR TO LONDON AND THERE THEY SAY WHEN DAWN IS HIGH AND ALL THE WORLD'S A BLAZE OF SKY THE CUCKOO THOUGH HE'S VERY SHY WILL SING A SONG FOR LONDON
SHE'S REALLY MACCONNELL'S POETIC MOTIF YOU SEE
DEAR ME IT TAKES A WOMAN TO THINK OF THAT NOW
THERE'S A LABORER THAT LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF THE DEAD IN THE CITY AS THE SUN SINKS LOW
DISSECTS THE COMMON CARNIVAL OF PASSIONS AND REGRETS AND GIVES THE WORLD A GLIMPSE OF ALL THE COLORS IT FORGETS
YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME HILDA
YOU HAVE BEEN BUSY
WINIFRED AND I HAVE BEEN UP IN CANADA FOR MOST OF THE AUTUMN
THEY MET A GOOD MANY ACQUAINTANCES
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE LIKE THIS ANY LONGER
AT LAST WITH A LITTLE SHIVER OF EXPECTANCY SHE TORE OPEN THE ENVELOPE AND READ BOSTON FEBRUARY
HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TOWARD HER AS HE LOOKED AWAY AGAIN INTO THE FIRE
HE LIKED EVERYTHING ABOUT HER HE TOLD HIMSELF BUT HE PARTICULARLY LIKED HER EYES
IT LOOKS LIKE A BIB SHE PUSHED HIS HAND AWAY QUICKLY AND STOOD LOOKING OUT INTO THE DESERTED SQUARE
BARTLEY SMILED TOO AND HIS EYES CLEARED
ONE AFTERNOON SOON AFTER HIS RETURN HE PUT ON HIS FROCK-COAT AND DROVE IN A HANSOM TO PAY A CALL UPON HILDA BURGOYNE WHO STILL LIVED AT HER OLD NUMBER OFF BEDFORD SQUARE
HE SAID SO AS SOON AS I MET HIM
THEN HE PAID HIS ACCOUNT AND WALKED RAPIDLY DOWN THE STRAND PAST CHARING CROSS STATION
TRY HIM AGAIN HILDA
IN HER DINNER DRESS SHE LOOKED EVEN YOUNGER THAN IN STREET CLOTHES AND FOR ALL HER COMPOSURE AND SELF-SUFFICIENCY SHE SEEMED TO HIM STRANGELY ALERT AND VIBRATING AS IF IN HER TOO THERE WERE SOMETHING NEVER ALTOGETHER AT REST
THERE WOULD BE NO GOING BACK
HE'S OFTEN TIRED WHEN HE'S LATE
THEY ARE READY
IT TORE ITSELF TO PIECES WITH ROARING AND GRINDING AND NOISES THAT WERE LIKE THE SHRIEKS OF A STEAM WHISTLE
I DIDN'T FEEL THAT I COULD GO SO FAR WITHOUT DEFINITE AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY IN YOUR TELEGRAM EXACTLY WHAT YOU THOUGHT AND ASK FOR YOUR AUTHORIZATION
AH NO NEED TO REMIND A MAN OF SEVENTY WHO HAS JUST BEEN HOME TO FIND THAT HE HAS SURVIVED ALL HIS CONTEMPORARIES
I'VE A NEAT LITTLE SUM IN THE BANK TOO NOW AND I OWN A MITE OF A HUT IN GALWAY
I COULD EAT ALL THE DINNERS THERE ARE IN LONDON TO-NIGHT
AND ANOTHER CURIOUS THING BARTLEY WILSON SPOKE WITH DELIBERATENESS AND SETTLED DEEPER INTO HIS CHAIR IS THAT I DON'T FEEL IT ANY LONGER
I'M SORRY
I DON'T WONDER YOU WERE PEPPERY
I HOPE YOU WILL SEE IT SOMETIME
I'VE WATCHED THAT DOOR ALL DAY
WHEN HE TRIES TO LIVE A SECOND HE DEVELOPS ANOTHER NATURE
IT WAS A PLEASANT KIND OF LONELINESS
PEOPLE LIVE A THOUSAND MILES APART
NOBODY BLAMES HIM MRS ALEXANDER
I'M TOO FOND OF HIM ALEXANDER MOVED RESTLESSLY
MAINHALL CUT IN IMPATIENTLY
BARTLEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
THEY WILL TAKE HIM UP THERE TAKE ME TO HIM NOW PLEASE
WHAT ABOUT US BARTLEY SHE ASKED IN A THIN VOICE
H.B
FOR HE WALKED SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH A SHADOWY COMPANION--NOT LITTLE HILDA BURGOYNE BY ANY MEANS BUT SOME ONE VASTLY DEARER TO HIM THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN--HIS OWN YOUNG SELF THE YOUTH WHO HAD WAITED FOR HIM UPON THE STEPS OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM THAT NIGHT AND WHO THOUGH HE HAD TRIED TO PASS SO QUIETLY HAD KNOWN HIM AND COME DOWN AND LINKED AN ARM IN HIS
THE PICCADILLY RESTAURANT
THE MAN WHO SAT IN HIS OFFICES IN BOSTON WAS ONLY A POWERFUL MACHINE
IF YOU CARE TO COME IT'S YOURSELF I'LL BE GLAD TO SEE AND YOU THINKING WELL OF YOURSELF
HE BELONGED TO THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE PLAY AND MOST OF US ARE ONLY ONLOOKERS AT THE BEST
AND WITH EVERY REVOLUTION OF THE WHEELS BENEATH HIM THE UNQUIET QUICKSILVER IN HIS BREAST TOLD HIM THAT AT MIDSUMMER HE WOULD BE IN LONDON
ONCE MORE THE KNIGHTS TO BATTLE GO WITH SWORD AND SHIELD AND LANCE TILL ONCE ONCE MORE THE SHATTERED FOE HAS WHIRLED INTO--A DANCE COME DOWN TO KEW IN LILAC TIME
I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO
AWAY WITH PERSPECTIVE
WHEN THE ACT WAS OVER ALEXANDER AND MAINHALL STROLLED OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR
YOU DIDN'T ALTOGETHER LIKE THAT
LIFE COQUETS WITH DASHING FELLOWS
IF I'D MET YOU LATER IF I HADN'T LOVED YOU SO WELL--BUT THAT'S ALL OVER LONG AGO
HOW GOOD YOU WERE TO COME BACK BEFORE CHRISTMAS
I DIDN'T KNOW IT BEFORE HILDA ON MY HONOR I DIDN'T BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS BECAUSE DEEP DOWN IN ME SOMEWHERE I WAS HOPING I MIGHT DRIVE YOU TO DO JUST THIS
TO A MAN WHO WAS SO LITTLE GIVEN TO REFLECTION WHOSE DREAMS ALWAYS TOOK THE FORM OF DEFINITE IDEAS REACHING INTO THE FUTURE THERE WAS A SEDUCTIVE EXCITEMENT IN RENEWING OLD EXPERIENCES IN IMAGINATION
THE PLOT AND FEELING ALIKE DEPENDED UPON HER LIGHTNESS OF FOOT HER LIGHTNESS OF TOUCH UPON THE SHREWDNESS AND DEFT FANCIFULNESS THAT PLAYED ALTERNATELY AND SOMETIMES TOGETHER IN HER MIRTHFUL BROWN EYES
THE METAL TRAPPINGS OF THE HARNESSES SHONE DAZZLINGLY AND THE WHEELS WERE REVOLVING DISKS THAT THREW OFF RAYS OF LIGHT
HIS EXISTENCE WAS BECOMING A NETWORK OF GREAT AND LITTLE DETAILS
SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A DRIVE OUT TO KEW AND RICHMOND
HIS DEVIATIONS TOO
HOUR AFTER HOUR SHE HAD BEEN WATCHING THE WATER THE LONELY USELESS STONE TOWERS AND THE CONVULSED MASS OF IRON WRECKAGE OVER WHICH THE ANGRY RIVER CONTINUALLY SPAT UP ITS YELLOW FOAM
SEEMS TO ME IT LOOKS PARTICULARLY WELL TO-NIGHT
AREN'T YOU TREMENDOUSLY PLEASED WITH YOURSELF SHE LAUGHED AGAIN AND SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS
BARTLEY'S ABSTRACTION AND WILSON'S REFLECTIONS WERE CUT SHORT BY A RUSTLE AT THE DOOR AND ALMOST BEFORE THEY COULD RISE MRS ALEXANDER WAS STANDING BY THE HEARTH
IN THE MORNING THE MORNING OF ALEXANDER'S DEPARTURE FOR ENGLAND THE RIVER WAS STREAKED WITH FOG AND THE RAIN DROVE HARD AGAINST THE WINDOWS OF THE BREAKFAST-ROOM
PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO COME BARTLEY DREW HER ARM ABOUT HIS NECK AND WENT TO THE DOOR WITH HER
YOU SEE THE TRUTH IS WE ARE HAVING TO BUILD PRETTY WELL TO THE STRAIN LIMIT UP THERE
I SOMETIMES WONDER WHAT SORT OF CHAP I'D HAVE BEEN IF I HADN'T BEEN THIS SORT
FOR A MERE FOLLY A MASQUERADE A LITTLE THING THAT HE COULD NOT LET GO
IF HE TOLD HER NOW HE KNEW IT WOULD BE IRRETRIEVABLE
THE WEATHER HAD SO FAR BEEN DARK AND RAW
THERE'S A MEETING OF BRITISH ENGINEERS AND I'M DOING ANOTHER BRIDGE IN CANADA YOU KNOW OH EVERY ONE KNOWS ABOUT THAT
IT WAS A LARGE ROOM OVER THE LIBRARY AND LOOKED OUT UPON THE BLACK RIVER AND THE ROW OF WHITE LIGHTS ALONG THE CAMBRIDGE EMBANKMENT
I FELT IT EVEN BEFORE I KNEW WHO HE WAS
ALEXANDER GREW IMPATIENT
SHE LOOKED AT IT INTENTLY TURNED IT OVER AND FELT ITS THICKNESS WITH HER FINGERS
I USED TO THINK THESE FOUR WALLS COULD STAND AGAINST ANYTHING
HORTON MOTIONED TO THE MEN AND SIX OF THEM LIFTED THE STRETCHER AND BEGAN TO CARRY IT UP THE EMBANKMENT
HILDA YOU'D BETTER THINK A WHILE LONGER BEFORE YOU DO THAT
THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF-CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPLASH
HE HAD PLANNED TO STOP IN LIVERPOOL
HE HAD LIVED THERE AS A STUDENT BUT FOR TWENTY YEARS AND MORE SINCE HE HAD BEEN PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN A WESTERN UNIVERSITY HE HAD SELDOM COME EAST EXCEPT TO TAKE A STEAMER FOR SOME FOREIGN PORT
AS TO HER NOT WISHING TO TAKE THE WORLD INTO HER CONFIDENCE--WELL IT IS A PRETTY BRUTAL AND STUPID WORLD AFTER ALL YOU KNOW HILDA LEANED FORWARD
IT RAN AND WAS NOT WEARIED ANTICIPATED HIM EVERYWHERE
HE REMEMBERED HOW WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY AND HIS FATHER CALLED HIM IN THE MORNING HE USED TO LEAP FROM HIS BED INTO THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIMSELF
NO I DON'T SUPPOSE HE DOES
HE HAD DONE IT FOR ALEXANDER WHEN THEY WERE STUDENTS TOGETHER IN PARIS
IT WAS AFTER NINE O'CLOCK AND HE WAS LIGHTING A SECOND PIPE WHEN HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A SOUND AT HIS DOOR
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HIS FIRST SUSPENSION BRIDGE IN CANADA THE ONE HE WAS DOING WHEN I FIRST KNEW HIM
DO YOU HEAR ME BARTLEY
IT'S A JOLT BUT WE'VE GOT TO FACE IT
WHAT LUCK
YOU MAY BRING THE AZALEAS UPSTAIRS
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS ALEXANDER WAS VERY BUSY
IN A WAY IT WOULD BE A SACRIFICE
SOLITUDE BUT NOT SOLITARINESS
THAT LAUGH NOW WHEN SHE DOUBLES OVER AT THE HIPS--WHO EVER HEARD IT OUT OF GALWAY
THE DAY BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE FOR LIVERPOOL WAS A SINGULARLY FINE ONE
IT WAS LONG SINCE ALEXANDER HAD THOUGHT OF ANY OF THESE THINGS BUT NOW THEY CAME BACK TO HIM QUITE FRESH AND HAD A SIGNIFICANCE THEY DID NOT HAVE WHEN THEY WERE FIRST TOLD HIM IN HIS RESTLESS TWENTIES
I SHOULDN'T WONDER BUT THEY'VE PROBABLY SPOILED HER SO THAT SHE'D BE TIRESOME IF ONE MET HER AGAIN BARTLEY SMILED AND YAWNED AND WENT TO BED
MARKS ON PAPER MEAN SOMETHING TO YOU HE PAUSED
WILSON WATCHED HIM WONDERING
MY FIRST TELEGRAM MISSED YOU SOMEHOW
THE FIRE CRACKLED IN THE GRATE THE RAIN BEAT INSISTENTLY UPON THE WINDOWS AND THE SLEEPY ANGORA LOOKED UP AT THEM CURIOUSLY
IN HIS YOUTH HE WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED SUCH A THING POSSIBLE
I WAS MOST GENTLY TREATED--AS A SORT OF PRECIOUS RELIC
YES I KNOW I KNOW
SHE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HER CHAIR AS IF SHE HAD ALIGHTED THERE FOR A MOMENT ONLY
MORE LIKE THE STAGE PEOPLE OF MY YOUNG DAYS--FOLK OF SIMPLE MANNERS
BUT AFTER SHE MET BARTLEY SHE PRETENDED TO LIKE IT AND SAID IT WAS A GOOD THING TO BE REMINDED THAT THERE WERE THINGS GOING ON IN THE WORLD
AFTER THE FOURTH NIGHT OUT WHEN HIS WILL SUDDENLY SOFTENED UNDER HIS HANDS HE HAD BEEN CONTINUALLY HAMMERING AWAY AT HIMSELF
YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
WINIFRED SAYS I ALWAYS WRECK THE HOUSE WHEN I TRY TO DO ANYTHING
PRESENTLY THOMAS MADE A DISCREET SOUND AT THE DOOR
SUDDENLY HE MOVED THE CLENCHED HAND HE HELD BEHIND HIM AND DROPPED IT VIOLENTLY AT HIS SIDE
FOR NOAH HARDLY KNEW A BIRD OF ANY KIND THAT ISN'T HEARD AT KEW AT KEW IN LILAC TIME AND OH SO NEAR TO LONDON AND WHEN THE ROSE BEGINS TO POUT AND ALL THE CHESTNUT SPIRES ARE OUT YOU'LL HEAR THE REST WITHOUT A DOUBT ALL CHORUSING FOR LONDON COME DOWN TO KEW IN LILAC TIME
NO I'VE BEEN MOONING ABOUT HERE HILDA LAUGHED GAYLY
YOU SEE I FEEL TOO--TOO POWERFUL THE CARRIAGE STOPPED
I WAS WRONG
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELEPHONE ME TO LET ME KNOW THAT YOU HAD
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT AT THIS MOMENT THEY HEARD THE FRONT DOOR SHUT WITH A JAR AND WILSON LAUGHED AS MRS ALEXANDER ROSE QUICKLY
THEY'VE CROWDED ME TOO MUCH ON THE COST
I'LL GO WITH YOU AND WE'LL SEND THE END RIVETERS IN FIRST ALEXANDER AND THE SUPERINTENDENT PICKED THEIR WAY OUT SLOWLY OVER THE LONG SPAN
GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE IT WAS NOT IN THE INGRATIATING TONE OF THE HABITUAL BEGGAR
I DON'T NEED MARIE TO DRESS ME THIS SEASON SO SHE KEEPS HOUSE FOR ME AND MY LITTLE GALWAY GIRL HAS GONE HOME FOR A VISIT
WE ARE TO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE TO DINNER TO-NIGHT AND WINIFRED'S LYING DOWN
ONLY ONE
AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME SHE TIED THE KNOT OF THE LAST LACING AND PUT HER BOOT-HEEL DOWN FIRMLY
HAS SHE GROWN MUCH OLDER SHE ASKED AT LAST
WHEN THEY REACHED THE HOUSE WHERE HILDA LODGED BARTLEY WENT ACROSS THE COURT WITH HER AND UP THE DARK OLD STAIRS TO THE THIRD LANDING
SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS MOST DESPONDENT WHEN HE THOUGHT HIMSELF WORN OUT WITH THIS STRUGGLE IN A FLASH HE WAS FREE OF IT AND LEAPED INTO AN OVERWHELMING CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIMSELF
IT LURCHED NEITHER TO RIGHT NOR LEFT BUT SANK ALMOST IN A VERTICAL LINE SNAPPING AND BREAKING AND TEARING AS IT WENT BECAUSE NO INTEGRAL PART COULD BEAR FOR AN INSTANT THE ENORMOUS STRAIN LOOSED UPON IT
MRS ALEXANDER SAT DOWN IN A HIGH-BACKED CHAIR AND BEGAN TO POUR IT WHILE WILSON SANK INTO A LOW SEAT OPPOSITE HER AND TOOK HIS CUP WITH A GREAT SENSE OF EASE AND HARMONY AND COMFORT
BUT ALEXANDER WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT HIS WORK
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT I HAD A LETTER FROM WILSON THIS MORNING EXPLAINING HIS TELEGRAM
HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT IT WAS A FEW MINUTES AFTER TWELVE
HURRYING TO CATCH TRAINS THAT HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MISS
WILSON WAS STANDING QUITE STILL CONTEMPLATING WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE THE SLANTING STREET WITH ITS WORN PAVING ITS IRREGULAR GRAVELY COLORED HOUSES AND THE ROW OF NAKED TREES ON WHICH THE THIN SUNLIGHT WAS STILL SHINING
ALEXANDER HAD WRITTEN TO HER ONLY TWICE BEFORE AND HE DID NOT ALLOW HER TO WRITE TO HIM AT ALL
AND WHILE YOU ARE TELEPHONING I'LL CHANGE MY DRESS
THERE WAS EVERYTHING BUT ENERGY
SHE LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST HIS ARM AND SPOKE SOFTLY YOU SEE MY MISTAKE WAS IN WANTING YOU TO HAVE EVERYTHING
IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE AT THE MERCY OF THE MAN THEY LOVE ANY LONGER ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY
BUT YOU MUST KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN IN LONDON SEVERAL TIMES WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND YOU MIGHT VERY WELL THINK THAT JUST NOW IS A RATHER INOPPORTUNE TIME SHE CUT HIM SHORT
NOW MAY I SHOW YOU SOMETHING
SHE LOOKED THEM OVER AND STARTED AS SHE CAME TO ONE IN A HANDWRITING THAT SHE DID NOT OFTEN SEE
BUT THE COMPLETE PEACE OF THE FIRST PART OF THE VOYAGE WAS OVER
SHE BELIEVED THAT SHE SOMETIMES HAD A KIND OF SECOND-SIGHT ABOUT LETTERS AND COULD TELL BEFORE SHE READ THEM WHETHER THEY BROUGHT GOOD OR EVIL TIDINGS
BUT ON MY OWN ACCOUNT I'M GLAD TO HAVE A FEW MOMENTS ALONE WITH YOU BEFORE BARTLEY COMES
I WAS FRIGHTENED AT YOUR PRODIGALITY I EXPECT IT WAS THE LAST FRANC I HAD
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT A GREAT DEAL AND I'VE QUITE DECIDED
HE STAYED OUT UNTIL THE LAST TINGE OF VIOLET HAD FADED FROM THE WATER
BUT I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK IT WAS BECAUSE OF THAT I WANTED TO SEE YOU HE SPOKE VERY SERIOUSLY AND LOOKED DOWN AT THE FLOOR
WHY I HAVEN'T HEARD OF HER FOR--YEARS MAINHALL LAUGHED
IT PROVED TO BE ONLY A LAMP-POST AND THEY BEAT IN FARTHER FROM THE EDGE OF THE PAVEMENT
AND NOW WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
AND NOW IT'S MARCHING ONWARD THROUGH THE REALMS OF OLD ROMANCE AND TROLLING OUT A FOND FAMILIAR TUNE AND NOW IT'S ROARING CANNON DOWN TO FIGHT THE KING OF FRANCE AND NOW IT'S PRATTLING SOFTLY TO THE MOON AND ALL AROUND THE ORGAN THERE'S A SEA WITHOUT A SHORE OF HUMAN JOYS AND WONDERS AND REGRETS
YOU USED TO SING IT SO WELL NONSENSE
THE WHITE BIRCHES WITH THEIR LITTLE UNFOLDING LEAVES GLEAMED IN THE LOWLANDS AND THE MARSH MEADOWS WERE ALREADY COMING TO LIFE WITH THEIR FIRST GREEN A THIN BRIGHT COLOR WHICH HAD RUN OVER THEM LIKE FIRE
THEY USUALLY SAY THAT HE HAS TURNED OUT VERY WELL OR REMARK THAT HE ALWAYS WAS A FINE FELLOW
BUT HE HAD PROMISED TO BE IN LONDON AT MID-SUMMER AND HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD GO
THE MEN WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE AND THROUGH THE YARD WITH THEIR CAPS IN THEIR HANDS
YET HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD GO TO LONDON
I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS A HUNDRED TIMES TO-DAY
IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND KINDLY
THE HOUSE WAS SOLD OUT AND HE STOOD THROUGH THE SECOND ACT
THERE WOULD BE NOTHING FOR HIM AFTERWARD
MRS ALEXANDER HAD BEEN DRIVING ABOUT ALL THE MORNING LEAVING PRESENTS AT THE HOUSES OF HER FRIENDS
YOU'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT ME TOO OLD FOR YOU HILDA,--OH OF COURSE YOU'VE NEVER SAID JUST THAT,--AND HERE THIS FELLOW IS NOT MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS YOUNGER THAN I
THERE'S EVERYTHING IN SEEING HILDA WHILE SHE'S FRESH IN A PART
AND IS THAT A PART OF SUCCESS WHY HOW ABSURD
I REALLY TRIED TO CARE AS YOU WANTED ME TO AWAY BACK IN THE BEGINNING WELL HERE WE ARE TURNING OUT OF THE SQUARE
HIS HARSHEST CRITICS DID NOT DOUBT THAT HAD HE LIVED HE WOULD HAVE RETRIEVED HIMSELF
THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEEDY POOR CHILD
HAD YOU RATHER HAVE YOUR TEA BROUGHT TO YOU THERE OR WILL YOU HAVE IT DOWN HERE WITH ME WHILE WE WAIT FOR BARTLEY WILSON WAS PLEASED TO FIND THAT HE HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF HER RAPID WALK AND WITH HER HE WAS EVEN MORE VASTLY PLEASED THAN BEFORE
AND THAT REMINDS ME
HIS DRY HUMOR WENT UNDER A CLOUD OF ABSENT-MINDED KINDLINESS WHICH MAINHALL EXPLAINED ALWAYS OVERTOOK HIM HERE
THE MORE DAZZLING THE FRONT YOU PRESENTED THE HIGHER YOUR FACADE ROSE THE MORE I EXPECTED TO SEE A BIG CRACK ZIGZAGGING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM,"--HE INDICATED ITS COURSE IN THE AIR WITH HIS FOREFINGER,--"THEN A CRASH AND CLOUDS OF DUST
OF COURSE HILDA IS IRISH,--THE BURGOYNES HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS,--AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
THERE'S AND OLD AND HARDENED DEMI-REP IT'S RINGING IN HER EARS IN THE CITY AS THE SUN SINKS LOW
I SHAN'T BE GONE MORE THAN A MONTH THIS TIME
HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS SNUGLY SETTLED
THEY HAVE ALL GROWN VERY SMART
YOU WILL EXCUSE HER WON'T YOU
TIME AND SUCCESS HAVE DONE WELL BY YOU YOU KNOW
I WAS WORKING WITH MACKELLER THEN AN OLD SCOTCH ENGINEER WHO HAD PICKED ME UP IN LONDON AND TAKEN ME BACK TO QUEBEC WITH HIM
BUT DEAR ME WE DO NEED SOME ONE JUST THEN THEY DROVE UP TO THE DUKE OF YORK'S SO ALEXANDER DID NOT COMMIT HIMSELF BUT FOLLOWED MAINHALL INTO THE THEATRE
HE CROSSED BACK TO WESTMINSTER WENT UP TO THE TEMPLE AND SAT DOWN TO SMOKE IN THE MIDDLE TEMPLE GARDENS LISTENING TO THE THIN VOICE OF THE FOUNTAIN AND SMELLING THE SPICE OF THE SYCAMORES THAT CAME OUT HEAVILY IN THE DAMP EVENING AIR
MACCONNELL LET ME INTRODUCE MR BARTLEY ALEXANDER
HE ROSE AND PUSHED THE CHAIR BEHIND HIM AND BEGAN TO WALK MISERABLY ABOUT THE ROOM SEEMING TO FIND IT TOO SMALL FOR HIM
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO FANCY ME IN FINE FEATHERS
WHEN HE THREW OPEN THE DOOR HE RECOGNIZED THE FIGURE THAT SHRANK BACK INTO THE BARE DIMLY LIT HALLWAY
A GANG OF FRENCH CANADIANS FELL ALMOST ON TOP OF HIM
AND I SHE WHISPERED,--"I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT
DID YOU WRITE TO ME
THE ROOM WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT ONE MIGHT EXPECT OF AN ENGINEER'S STUDY
HE COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT THERE WERE UNREASONING AND UNREASONABLE ACTIVITIES GOING ON IN ALEXANDER ALL THE WHILE
STALK IN AS YOU ARE AND DON'T MAKE EXCUSES
HOW CAME HE HERE AMONG ALL THESE DIRTY PEOPLE
IF WE HAD ONE REAL CRITIC IN LONDON--BUT WHAT CAN ONE EXPECT
CHAPTER V IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS
HOW MANY STREET PIANOS THERE ARE ABOUT TO-NIGHT
IT ISN'T THE END OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW
I LANDED AT LIVERPOOL THIS MORNING AND CAME DOWN ON THE BOAT TRAIN ALEXANDER LEANED FORWARD AND WARMED HIS HANDS BEFORE THE BLAZE
AFTER ALL LIFE DOESN'T OFFER A MAN MUCH
THOUGH I DO LOVE TO OPEN THE BOXES AND I TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEM WHY WON'T YOU LET ME SEND YOU ANY OF THOSE JADE OR IVORY THINGS YOU ARE SO FOND OF
OR PICTURES
IT PUT A GIRDLE ROUND THE EARTH WHILE HE WAS GOING FROM NEW YORK TO MOORLOCK
THE FIRST WAS--SORT OF IN PLAY WASN'T IT HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED
INDEED HE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN HER
I WISH I HAD ASKED YOU TO MEET ME AT THE OFFICE AND WALK HOME WITH ME WINIFRED
HARK A HUNDRED THOUSAND FEET ARE MARCHING ON TO GLORY THROUGH THE POPPIES AND THE WHEAT IN THE LAND WHERE THE DEAD DREAMS GO
BUT I WONDER WHETHER YOU'D THINK ME IMPERTINENT IF I ASKED YOU TO LET ME COME TO SEE YOU SOMETIME AND TELL YOU ABOUT THEM WHY SHOULD I
WILSON FELT AT ONCE THE HARMONY OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT HAVE LIVED LONG TOGETHER WITHOUT OBTRUSIONS OF UGLINESS OR CHANGE
IF HE COULD NOT THEN ALL THE MORE WAS EVERYTHING CHANGED FOR HIM
SHE HAD BEEN VERY HANDSOME BUT NOT IN WINIFRED'S WAY
I'M NOT ACCUSTOMED TO INQUIRING INTO THE MOTIVES OF MY GUESTS
WHAT HAD HE DONE TO LOSE IT
ALL AROUND MY GALA HAT I WEAR A WREATH OF ROSES A LONG AND LONELY YEAR IT IS I'VE WAITED FOR THE MAY IF ANY ONE SHOULD ASK YOU THE REASON WHY I WEAR IT IS MY OWN LOVE MY TRUE LOVE IS COMING HOME TO-DAY
A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAINHALL WHISPERED
WILSON GLANCED TOWARD THE FIRE WHERE BARTLEY'S PROFILE WAS STILL WREATHED IN CIGAR SMOKE THAT CURLED UP MORE AND MORE SLOWLY
WINIFRED THOMAS CAN BRING MY TRUNK DOWN
HE WAS SUBMERGED IN THE VAST IMPERSONAL GRAYNESS ABOUT HIM AND AT INTERVALS THE SIDELONG ROLL OF THE BOAT MEASURED OFF TIME LIKE THE TICKING OF A CLOCK
HILDA LIVED ALONE ATTENDED BY A VERY PRETTY AND COMPETENT FRENCH SERVANT WHO ANSWERED THE DOOR AND BROUGHT IN THE TEA
THEY DROVE BACK WITH A GLORIOUS SUNSET BEHIND THEM TOWARD THE DISTANT GOLD-WASHED CITY
HOW TERRIBLY DISCERNING YOU ARE SHE LOOKED STRAIGHT AT WILSON AND HE FELT THAT THIS QUICK FRANK GLANCE BROUGHT ABOUT AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM
HE REMEMBERED HIS LAST NIGHT THERE
I FEEL AS IF A SECOND MAN HAD BEEN GRAFTED INTO ME
GETTING UP IN THE MORNING WITH A GREAT BUSTLE AND SPLASHING OF WATER TO BEGIN A DAY THAT HAD NO PURPOSE AND NO MEANING
HE STARTED AND LISTENED HOLDING THE BURNING MATCH IN HIS HAND
MAY I USE YOUR TELEPHONE
AND WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO HILDA WITH THIS UGLY STORY
WE WERE MARRIED AS SOON AS IT WAS FINISHED AND YOU WILL LAUGH WHEN I TELL YOU THAT IT ALWAYS HAS A RATHER BRIDAL LOOK TO ME
THAT LOOKED LIKE ALEXANDER BUT WHAT WOULD HE BE DOING BACK THERE IN THE DAYCOACHES IT WAS INDEED ALEXANDER
YET I ALWAYS USED TO FEEL THAT THERE WAS A WEAK SPOT WHERE SOME DAY STRAIN WOULD TELL
HE STARTED OUT UPON THESE WALKS HALF GUILTILY WITH A CURIOUS LONGING AND EXPECTANCY WHICH WERE WHOLLY GRATIFIED BY SOLITUDE
AND NOW DON'T YOU WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS AND LIE DOWN FOR AN HOUR
HERE PUT YOUR FEET ON THIS STOOL
THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE COME ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
YOU WOULDN'T BE HAPPY
HIS NOSTRIL LONG UNUSED TO IT WAS QUICK TO DETECT THE SMELL OF WOOD SMOKE IN THE AIR BLENDED WITH THE ODOR OF MOIST SPRING EARTH AND THE SALTINESS THAT CAME UP THE RIVER WITH THE TIDE
DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE A BIT CONSCIOUS TO-NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME
SHE OPENED THE CARRIAGE DOOR BEFORE HE REACHED HER AND STEPPED TO THE GROUND
I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
THE TRAIN WAS TEARING ON THROUGH THE DARKNESS
BESIDES HIS SLEEPING-ROOM AND BATH THERE WAS A LARGE ROOM FORMERLY A PAINTER'S STUDIO WHICH HE USED AS A STUDY AND OFFICE
THERE'S SOMETHING TROUBLING YOU BARTLEY
WHEN ALEXANDER CAME BACK FROM DINNER HE PUT MORE WOOD ON HIS FIRE MADE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE AND SETTLED DOWN AT HIS DESK WHERE HE BEGAN CHECKING OVER ESTIMATE SHEETS
WHEN AT LAST LUCIUS WILSON WAS ANNOUNCED ALEXANDER SPRANG EAGERLY TO HIS FEET AND HURRIED TO MEET HIS OLD INSTRUCTOR
HE TOOK A DESK IN THE OFFICE OF A SCOTCH ENGINEERING FIRM ON HENRIETTA STREET AND WAS AT WORK ALMOST CONSTANTLY
AND THOSE BOYS BACK THERE BEGINNING IT ALL JUST AS HE HAD BEGUN IT
IT ISN'T FAR FROM LONDON COME DOWN TO KEW IN LILAC TIME
IT'S NOT WORTH MUCH BUT I LOVE IT
THANK YOU MAC FOR EVERYTHING
BUT WITH THE GLOW OF AN IMMEDIATE INTEREST GONE OUT OF IT THE ENGINEER'S FACE LOOKED TIRED EVEN A LITTLE HAGGARD
I DON'T BELIEVE HE REMEMBERS SHE SAID SUDDENLY
I SHOULD HAVE THROWN UP THE JOB WHEN THEY CROWDED ME
I'M GROWING OLDER AND YOU'VE GOT MY YOUNG SELF HERE WITH YOU
A MAN WRITES TO THE TOP OF HIS BENT ONLY ONCE THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MAINHALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP-SET FADED EYES AND MADE A WRY FACE
WE USED TO CATCH THEM AND PUT THEM UP IN THE CORRAL AND THEY DEVELOPED GREAT CUNNING
HE LOOKED ABOUT FOR HER RATHER NERVOUSLY AND FINALLY FOUND HER AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGE DRAWING-ROOM THE CENTRE OF A CIRCLE OF MEN YOUNG AND OLD
A HARP-SHAPED ELM STOOD STRIPPED AGAINST THE PALE-COLORED EVENING SKY WITH RAGGED LAST YEAR'S BIRDS NESTS IN ITS FORKS AND THROUGH THE BARE BRANCHES THE EVENING STAR QUIVERED IN THE MISTY AIR
WINIFRED WAS NOT A WOMAN WHO COULD BEAR DISAPPOINTMENT
BUT THEY CAME ONLY THIS MORNING AND THEY HAVE NOT EVEN BEGUN TO OPEN
WHEN HE REACHED HILDA'S APARTMENT SHE MET HIM FRESH AS THE MORNING ITSELF
I WANT TO ORDER THE CARRIAGE OH HOW JOLLY
THIS TOO WAS LIFE AND LIFE WAS ACTIVITY JUST AS IT WAS IN BOSTON OR IN LONDON
IT HAS THE FASCINATION OF A SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY
HE HEARD HER CHEERFUL GOOD-NIGHT CABBY AS SHE RAN UP THE STEPS AND OPENED THE DOOR WITH A LATCHKEY
YOU'RE HANDSOMER THAN EVER AND YOU'VE GAINED A GRAND MANNER ALEXANDER BLUSHED AND BOWED
I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT IF I COULD GET OUT OF MY OLD CASE I MIGHT WIN YOU YET
HE HAD MENTIONED ME TO HER SO WHEN I WENT TO ALLWAY SHE ASKED ME TO COME TO SEE HER
HOW ONE HID HIS YOUTH UNDER HIS COAT AND HUGGED IT
SING `THE HARP THAT ONCE HILDA
HE TURNED AND WALKED BACK ALONG THE IRON RAILING AS THE CAB CAME UP TO HILDA'S NUMBER AND STOPPED
IT WAS A SWEET LONELY KIND OF SUMMER EVENING
HER HAPPINESS WAS A HAPPINESS A DEUX NOT APART FROM THE WORLD BUT ACTUALLY AGAINST IT
IS IT YOU INDEED PROFESSOR WILSON
IT WAS CURIOUS
SITTING BEHIND HER HE WATCHED HER WITH PERPLEXED ADMIRATION SHADING HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND
DEATH AND LOVE THE RUSHING RIVER AND HIS BURNING HEART
YOU MUST BE THE BUSIEST MAN IN THE WORLD
I HAVEN'T FELT SO JOLLY THIS LONG WHILE HILDA LOOKED UP WITH A SMILE WHICH SHE TRIED NOT TO MAKE TOO GLAD
THERE MUST BE A GOOD EAR TO BEGIN WITH AND A NOSE"--HE WAVED HIS HAND--"ABOVE REPROACH
WE WALKED ON DOWN BY THE RIVER DIDN'T WE HILDA LAUGHED AND LOOKED AT HIM QUESTIONINGLY
ANOTHER CUP PLEASE YES THANK YOU
ONCE MORE IT TURNS AND RANGES THROUGH ALL ITS JOY AND PAIN
HER ROOMS WERE FLOODED WITH SUNSHINE AND FULL OF THE FLOWERS HE HAD BEEN SENDING HER
FELT HIM WITH A DIFFERENCE OF COURSE HILDA LEANED FORWARD HER ELBOW ON HER KNEE HER CHIN ON HER HAND
THE THICK AIR HAD CLEARED OVERNIGHT IN A STRONG WIND WHICH BROUGHT IN A GOLDEN DAWN AND THEN FELL OFF TO A FRESH BREEZE
THEY WENT DELIBERATELY STOPPING TO SEE WHAT EACH GANG WAS DOING AS IF THEY WERE ON AN ORDINARY ROUND OF INSPECTION
AND THIS THEN WAS TO BE THE DISASTER THAT HIS OLD PROFESSOR HAD FORESEEN FOR HIM
HE'LL BE ALONG SOMETIME THIS AFTERNOON
I FELT IT DISTINCTLY AS I WAS COMING THROUGH THE BERKSHIRES
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN HILDA HELD HER FACE BACK FROM HIM AND BEGAN TO CRY BITTERLY
FORGET EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT I AM HERE I THINK I HAVE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING BUT THAT ALREADY SHE MURMURED
IF ANY ONE IS TO BLAME I'M AFRAID IT'S I
`FORGET THYSELF TO MARBLE
HE HAD THOUGHT HE COULD DO SO ONCE
YOU REMEMBER OUR PRIESTESS MUMMY OVER IN THE MUMMY-ROOM AND HOW WE USED TO LONG TO GO AND BRING HER OUT ON NIGHTS LIKE THIS
SO IT'S BETTER TO BE AT THE MERCY OF A MAN YOU DON'T LOVE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES INFINITELY THERE WAS A FLASH IN HER EYES THAT MADE ALEXANDER'S FALL
EARLY ON THE MORNING OF THE SECOND DAY A CLOSED CARRIAGE WAS DRIVEN SLOWLY ALONG THE RIVER-BANK AND STOPPED A LITTLE BELOW THE WORKS WHERE THE RIVER BOILED AND CHURNED ABOUT THE GREAT IRON CARCASS WHICH LAY IN A STRAIGHT LINE TWO THIRDS ACROSS IT
I REMEMBER WE WERE SITTING ALONE IN THE DUSK AFTER BARTLEY HAD BEEN THERE FOR THE FIRST TIME
HER SLIPPERS AND DRESSING GOWN WERE WAITING FOR HER BEFORE THE FIRE
THE ANIMATION DIED OUT OF HIS FACE BUT IN HIS EYES THERE WAS A RESTLESS LIGHT A LOOK OF APPREHENSION AND SUSPENSE
AND WHAT AN AUDIENCE
THEY ARE CRAMMED AND JAMMED IN BUSSES AND--THEY'RE EACH OF THEM ALONE IN THE LAND WHERE THE DEAD DREAMS GO
ONCE MORE LA TRAVIATA SIGHS ANOTHER SADDER SONG
HE WOULD NOT EVEN ADMIT THAT IT WAS STRONGER THAN HE
WHEN A GREAT MAN DIES IN HIS PRIME THERE IS NO SURGEON WHO CAN SAY WHETHER HE DID WELL
YOU CAN'T GET AT THE YOUNG BARTLEY EXCEPT BY MEANS OF COLOR WILSON PAUSED AND DELIBERATED
HILDA STUDIED HIM IN WIDE-EYED ASTONISHMENT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN BROKE INTO A LOW AMUSED LAUGH
LAMB WOULDN'T CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MANY OF THEM I FANCY ALEXANDER WENT BACK TO BEDFORD SQUARE A SECOND SUNDAY AFTERNOON
HE KEPT CLASPING AND UNCLASPING HIS BIG HANDS AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO REALIZE SOMETHING
SHE CONSIDERED THAT A NEWFANGLED WAY OF MAKING A MATCH OF IT WHEN ALEXANDER CAME IN A FEW MOMENTS LATER HE FOUND WILSON AND HIS WIFE STILL CONFRONTING THE PHOTOGRAPH
THE SILVERY LIGHT HAD FADED FROM THE BARE BOUGHS AND THE WATERY TWILIGHT WAS SETTING IN WHEN WILSON AT LAST WALKED DOWN THE HILL DESCENDING INTO COOLER AND COOLER DEPTHS OF GRAYISH SHADOW
THERE HE IS
IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
I WAS ALL RIGHT UNTIL I KNEW YOU WERE IN TOWN
SHE LOVED LIFE AND BARTLEY BROUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF IT IN TO HER WHEN HE CAME TO THE HOUSE
DO YOU KNOW I AM QUITE TIRED
THE THING THAT PERTURBED HIM WENT ON AS STEADILY AS HIS PULSE BUT HE WAS ALMOST UNCONSCIOUS OF IT
I LIVE VERY FAR OUT OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW
IT WAS LIKE THE DEEP VIBRATION OF SOME VAST UNDERGROUND MACHINERY AND LIKE THE MUFFLED PULSATIONS OF MILLIONS OF HUMAN HEARTS
THE MACHINERY WAS ALWAYS POUNDING AWAY IN THIS MAN AND WILSON PREFERRED COMPANIONS OF A MORE REFLECTIVE HABIT OF MIND
IT'S LILAC TIME IN LONDON BUY A BUNCH OF VIOLETS FOR THE LADY
DID THE CYCLAMENS COME AN HOUR AGO
I THINK YOU HAD BETTER STOP WORK OUT THERE AT ONCE DAN
I CAN SEE HIM POSTING DOWN STATE STREET TO THE STEAMSHIP OFFICES
COME OVER TO THE FIRE
EVENTUALLY I SUPPOSE HE WILL ABSORB ME ALTOGETHER
GOOD-NIGHT MACCONNELL TRUDGED OFF THROUGH THE FOG AND SHE WENT SLOWLY UPSTAIRS
WHEN THE LOW SKY THINNED A TRIFLE THE PALE WHITE SPOT OF A SUN DID NO MORE THAN THROW A BLUISH LUSTRE ON THE WATER GIVING IT THE DARK BRIGHTNESS OF NEWLY CUT LEAD
HIS BUSINESS OFTEN CALLED HIM TO NEW YORK AND HE HAD KEPT AN APARTMENT THERE FOR YEARS SUBLETTING IT WHEN HE WENT ABROAD FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
I WAS ALL THE MORNING WRITING IT
THE MUSIC'S GOOD THERE THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE THERE WHOM ONE KNOWS
I CAN'T STAND SEEING YOU MISERABLE I CAN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF ANY LONGER HE ANSWERED ROUGHLY
DEEP DOWN IN HIM SOMEWHERE HIS RESOLUTION WAS WEAKENING AND STRENGTHENING EBBING AND FLOWING
CAN'T YOU REMEMBER THAT HE PUT HIS ARM ABOUT HER
BARTLEY TOOK HIS ARM AND THEY WENT TOGETHER INTO THE STATION BUFFET
THOSE POOR WOMEN OUT THERE DO THEY BLAME HIM VERY MUCH SHE ASKED AS SHE HANDED THE COFFEE-CUP BACK TO HORTON
DO YOU THINK I KEPT AWAY BY ACCIDENT
AUNT ELEANOR FASCINATED ME AS FEW YOUNG WOMEN HAVE EVER DONE
HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
COURAGE SHE SAID GAYLY
IN THE HALF-LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH AMUSEMENT SIR HARRY'S JUDICIAL FROWN
WHAT YOU WANT IS A PICTURE OF HIM STANDING BACK THERE AT THE OTHER END OF TWENTY YEARS
OH I FACED THAT LONG AGO WHEN YOU WERE ON YOUR FIRST BRIDGE UP AT OLD ALLWAY
AND THEY LOVE YOUR THINGS OVER THERE DON'T THEY SHALL YOU BE GLAD FOR--ANY OTHER REASON HILDA MACCONNELL PUT HIS HAND IN FRONT OF HER TO WARD OFF SOME DARK OBJECT
SOME OF THEM COULD SWIM BUT THEY WERE EITHER HURT OR CRAZED WITH FRIGHT
WHY DON'T YOU WEAR SOME OF THOSE PINK ROSES HE ASKED
HE WENT BACK AND STOOD OVER HER
A BOTHER OF COURSE BUT THE SORT OF THING ONE IS ALWAYS HAVING TO PUT UP WITH
HE WAS UNDER THE RIVER A LONG TIME AND HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN HOLDING HIS BREATH
THAT WAS NOT THE REALITY OF HIS LIFE
BARTLEY'S BRIDGES ALWAYS SEEM TO ME LIKE THAT
BUT THE WORLD HAS MADE IT SWEET AND FULFILLED IT WITH THE SUNSET GLOW
THEY ARE GOING TO BEGIN REPAIRS ON THE THEATRE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF MARCH AND WE ARE TO RUN OVER TO NEW YORK FOR SIX WEEKS
YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU WALKED DOWN--AND WITHOUT OVERSHOES HILDA HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS
SHE NEVER LETS HIM GO
IF HER FACE HAD CHANGED AT ALL IT WAS IN A SLIGHT HARDENING OF THE MOUTH--STILL EAGER ENOUGH TO BE VERY DISCONCERTING AT TIMES HE FELT--AND IN AN ADDED AIR OF SELF-POSSESSION AND SELF-RELIANCE
OH YES
HE HAD NOT BEEN INSIDE THE MUSEUM ACTUALLY SINCE HE AND HILDA USED TO MEET THERE
IT'S THROUGH HIM THAT I'VE COME TO WISH FOR YOU ALL AND ALL THE TIME HE TOOK HER ROUGHLY IN HIS ARMS
SHE HAD SUCH A FLAVOR OF LIFE ABOUT HER
THE ONES WHO HAVE ANY IMAGINATION DO HILDA BURGOYNE ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED MILDLY
HUGH MACCONNELL CAME WITH HIS SISTER AND STOOD ABOUT MANAGING HIS TEA-CUP AWKWARDLY AND WATCHING EVERY ONE OUT OF HIS DEEP-SET FADED EYES
BUT I MAY MEET HIM IN THE STREET EVEN BEFORE HE COMES TO SEE ME MARIE PLACED THE TEA-TABLE BY THE FIRE AND BROUGHT HILDA HER LETTERS
SHE MUST CERTAINLY HE REFLECTED BE THIRTY AND HE WAS HONESTLY DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT THE YEARS HAD TREATED HER SO INDULGENTLY
IT WAS NOT VERY LONG INDEED BEFORE HIS COAT HUNG WITH A DISCOURAGED SAG FROM HIS GAUNT SHOULDERS AND HIS HAIR AND BEARD WERE RUMPLED AS IF HE HAD BEEN OUT IN A GALE
AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDER'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE
IN A FEW MOMENTS THE LIGHTS FLARED UP BRIGHTLY BEHIND THE WHITE CURTAINS AND AS HE WALKED AWAY HE HEARD A WINDOW RAISED
MORE EVEN THAN THE REST OF US SHE DIDN'T CHOOSE HER DESTINY
NO YOU WEREN'T MISTAKEN
I AM SO UNCONSCIOUSLY THRIFTY SHE LAUGHED AS SHE LOOKED ABOUT THE ROOM
SHE WAS PALE AND UNNATURALLY CALM
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE ME SAY THAT
MOST ACTRESSES NOWADAYS LEARN TO SING PROPERLY SO I TRIED A MASTER
THE MIND THAT SOCIETY HAD COME TO REGARD AS A POWERFUL AND RELIABLE MACHINE DEDICATED TO ITS SERVICE MAY FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN SICK WITHIN ITSELF AND BENT UPON ITS OWN DESTRUCTION
I SHAN'T BE LONG
AND YET HE COULD REMEMBER IT ALL SO WELL
HE HAD THE CONTRACT FOR THE ALLWAY BRIDGE BUT BEFORE HE BEGAN WORK ON IT HE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS GOING TO DIE AND HE ADVISED THE COMMITTEE TO TURN THE JOB OVER TO ME
HE SAW A GLEAM IN HER EYES THAT HE REMEMBERED EVEN BETTER THAN THE EPISODE HE WAS RECALLING
THAT NOTHING CAN HAPPEN TO HER AFTER BARTLEY YES SAID HILDA SOFTLY NOTHING CAN HAPPEN TO ONE AFTER BARTLEY THEY BOTH SAT LOOKING INTO THE FIRE
I'M NOT GOING UNTIL TO-MORROW YOU KNOW BARTLEY ANNOUNCED SUDDENLY
HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A KEEN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY-GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD
AT THE FIRST SHRIEK OF THE TEARING IRON ALEXANDER JUMPED FROM THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
I GAVE HER ALL MY OLD CLOTHES EVEN MY OLD HATS THOUGH SHE ALWAYS WEARS HER BRETON HEADDRESS
I HAVE BEEN HAPPIER IN THIS ROOM THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
BUT IT'S NO USE TALKING ABOUT THAT NOW
I MEANT TO SAVE THEM UNTIL TO-MORROW BUT I WANT YOU TO WEAR THEM TO-NIGHT HE TOOK A LITTLE LEATHER BOX OUT OF HIS POCKET AND OPENED IT
WE SHOULDN'T WONDER TOO MUCH AT MRS ALEXANDER
PERHAPS HE KNOWS IT ALREADY HILDA KEPT THINKING AS SHE UNDRESSED
SOMETHING HAD BROKEN LOOSE IN HIM OF WHICH HE KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT THAT IT WAS SULLEN AND POWERFUL AND THAT IT WRUNG AND TORTURED HIM
I'M SO PLEASED THAT YOU THINK ME WORTH THAT YELLOW DRESS YOU KNOW HE SAID TAKING HER HAND AND LOOKING HER OVER ADMIRINGLY FROM THE TOES OF HER CANARY SLIPPERS TO HER SMOOTHLY PARTED BROWN HAIR
HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
I'VE DECIDED TO GO OVER TO NEW YORK TO-MORROW NIGHT AND TAKE A FAST BOAT
NO DEAR THANK YOU
IT WAS ALWAYS MISS BURGOYNE WHOM HE STARTED OUT TO FIND AND HE GOT NO FARTHER THAN THE TEMPLE GARDENS AND THE EMBANKMENT
ALEXANDER SAT WITH HIS HANDS CLENCHED ON HIS KNEES
IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN A LONDON THEATRE
YOU ARE NOT THAT KIND OF WOMAN
WE UNDERSTAND THAT DO WE NOT BARTLEY LOOKED RUFFLED AND TURNED THE SEAL RING ON HIS LITTLE FINGER ABOUT AWKWARDLY
SOMERSET HOUSE AND THE BLEACHED GRAY PINNACLES ABOUT WHITEHALL WERE FLOATED IN A LUMINOUS HAZE
FLORENCE MERRILL AND CYRIL HENDERSON
BARTLEY ROSE AND INSPECTED HER
SO FEW WOMEN CAN
ALEXANDER TOOK HER TWO HANDS FROM HIS SHOULDERS AND SWUNG THEM BACK AND FORTH IN HIS OWN LAUGHING HIS BIG BLOND LAUGH
EVERYTHING IS AWFULLY GRIM AND CHEERLESS OUR WEATHER AND OUR HOUSES AND OUR WAYS OF AMUSING OURSELVES
WILL YOU COME AND DINE WITH ME SUNDAY EVENING AT HALF-PAST SEVEN
EVER SO MANY PEOPLE COME ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS I KNOW
AND I LIKED HIM JUST AS HE WAS
AFTER HE MET WINIFRED PEMBERTON HE SEEMED TO HIMSELF LIKE A DIFFERENT MAN
HELP ME HILDA
HE IS COMING ON BECAUSE AN OLD UNCLE UP IN VERMONT HAS CONVENIENTLY DIED AND LEFT WILSON A LITTLE MONEY--SOMETHING LIKE TEN THOUSAND
SHE SENT FOR FRESH TEA AND MADE HIM COMFORTABLE AS SHE HAD SUCH A KNACK OF MAKING PEOPLE COMFORTABLE
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS HIS REPUTATION HAD BECOME AS THE SAYING IS POPULAR
IT IS ALWAYS AS IF THEY WERE TALKING OF SOMEONE I HAD NEVER MET
MYSELF I ALWAYS KNEW SHE HAD IT IN HER
BUT AFTERWARD I SHAN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN FOR I SHAN'T BE SEEING YOU AGAIN ALEXANDER STARTED TO SPEAK BUT CAUGHT HIMSELF
I HOPE SO
THEY HAD LUNCH AT RICHMOND AND THEN WALKED TO TWICKENHAM WHERE THEY HAD SENT THE CARRIAGE
IT'S LILAC TIME IN LONDON BUT BUY A BUNCH OF VIOLETS FOR THE LADY
HOW EARLY MAY I COME SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND AND FLUSHED AND LAUGHED
WHY YOU'VE BEEN OVER TWICE SINCE I WAS HERE IN THE SPRING HAVEN'T YOU OH I WAS IN LONDON ABOUT TEN DAYS IN THE SUMMER
WHEN THE STORY WAS FINISHED MISS BURGOYNE TURNED POINTEDLY TO ALEXANDER AND THE OTHER MEN DRIFTED AWAY
ARE YOU COMFY AND NOT TOO TIRED I'M NOT TIRED AT ALL
CHAPTER X ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON A BOSTON LAWYER WHO HAD BEEN TRYING A CASE IN VERMONT WAS STANDING ON THE SIDING AT WHITE RIVER JUNCTION WHEN THE CANADIAN EXPRESS PULLED BY ON ITS NORTHWARD JOURNEY
I SHOULD SAY THAT THE LOWER CHORD HERE MIGHT BUCKLE AT ANY MOMENT
THOUGH MARIE IS CLEAN--REALLY CLEAN AS THE FRENCH ARE
THERE WAS A LONG OILY SWELL THAT MADE EXERCISE LABORIOUS
THEY TOOK HIS MIND BACK A LONG WAY TO A CAMPFIRE ON A SANDBAR IN A WESTERN RIVER AND HE WISHED HE COULD GO BACK AND SIT DOWN WITH THEM
YOU'RE THE REALEST THING I HAVE WILSON CHUCKLED
DID YOU MEAN JUST TO--QUIT ME SHE ASKED
BUT THIS DEAD CALM OF MIDDLE LIFE WHICH CONFRONTED HIM,--OF THAT HE WAS AFRAID
SHE WAS A PERSON OF DISTINCTION HE SAW AT ONCE AND MOREOVER VERY HANDSOME
IT WAS LIKE BEING BURIED ALIVE
ONE AFTERNOON AFTER HE HAD TEA HE STARTED FOR A WALK DOWN THE EMBANKMENT TOWARD WESTMINSTER INTENDING TO END HIS STROLL AT BEDFORD SQUARE AND TO ASK WHETHER MISS BURGOYNE WOULD LET HIM TAKE HER TO THE THEATRE
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE RUSHING ABOUT DOWN THERE GOING TO GOOD DINNERS AND CLUBS AND THEATRES WILL BE DEAD SOME DAY AND NOT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING
HE HEARD HILDA MOVING ABOUT BEHIND HIM
I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED WORK BEFORE HE CAME
THIS NEW FORCE WAS NOT HE IT WAS BUT A PART OF HIM
WILL YOU HAND ME THE HOLLY HE CLIMBED UP THE STEPLADDER WHICH CREAKED UNDER HIS WEIGHT AND BEGAN TO TWIST THE TOUGH STEMS OF THE HOLLY INTO THE FRAME-WORK OF THE CHANDELIER
DON'T YOU KNOW YOU ARE HIS VOICE GREW SOFTER HIS TOUCH MORE AND MORE TENDER
HOW WELL YOU ARE LOOKING MY DEAR AND HOW RESTED HE PEERED UP AT HER FROM HIS LOW CHAIR BALANCING THE TIPS OF HIS LONG FINGERS TOGETHER IN A JUDICIAL MANNER WHICH HAD GROWN ON HIM WITH YEARS
SHE'S AN ELEGANT LITTLE PERSON AND QUITE CAPABLE OF AN EXTRAVAGANT BIT OF SENTIMENT LIKE THAT
I HAVE JUST NOW BEEN THINKING THAT THIS IS OUR TWELFTH CHRISTMAS
BARTLEY RECOGNIZED THE PRIMROSE SATIN GOWN SHE HAD WORN THAT FIRST EVENING AT LADY WALFORD'S
I AM GOING DOWN TO THE MUSIC-ROOM WHY NOT PRACTICE HERE
HE REMEMBERED THAT IN SO FAR AS SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP AT ALL SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN BLOOMSBURY
SHE LUNCHED ALONE AND AS SHE ROSE FROM THE TABLE SHE SPOKE TO THE BUTLER
HE AVOIDED THE CLUBS AND USUALLY DINED ALONE AT HIS HOTEL
WINIFRED FOLLOWED THEM THE HALF-MILE TO HORTON'S HOUSE
IN A TRAGIC WAY SHE IS EVEN HANDSOMER
THEY TOOK OFF THEIR HATS AND CAPS AS WINIFRED APPROACHED AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD PULLED HER VEIL DOWN OVER HER FACE THEY DID NOT LOOK UP AT HER
IT'S TOO LATE
WELL I THINK WE WON'T TALK ABOUT BRIDGES HERE AT ANY RATE BARTLEY LOOKED DOWN AT THE TOE OF HER YELLOW SLIPPER WHICH WAS TAPPING THE RUG IMPATIENTLY UNDER THE HEM OF HER GOWN
I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIR
AS HE STEPPED OUT OF THE DOOR A GALE LIFTED HIS HEAVY FUR COAT ABOUT HIS SHOULDERS
WHEN SHE SAW ALEXANDER SHE ROSE QUICKLY AND PUT OUT HER HAND
BUT ANGEL--DO YOU REMEMBER ANGEL PERFECTLY
HE WAS AT HOME AGAIN AMONG ALL THE DEAR FAMILIAR THINGS THAT SPOKE TO HIM OF SO MANY HAPPY YEARS
HE CROSSED CHARLES STREET BETWEEN JANGLING STREET CARS AND SHELVING LUMBER DRAYS AND AFTER A MOMENT OF UNCERTAINTY WOUND INTO BRIMMER STREET
LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE SEEN YOU MORE THAN ONCE
ALEXANDER LOOKED BACK WISTFULLY AT THE BOYS CAMPED ON THE EDGE OF A LITTLE MARSH CROUCHING UNDER THEIR SHELTER AND LOOKING GRAVELY AT THEIR FIRE
IT WAS A QUARTER PAST TEN
SOMETIMES IT BATTERED HIM LIKE THE CANNON ROLLING IN THE HOLD OF THE VESSEL
BUT THAT GARDEN IS CLOSED TO ME
HE GOT THROUGH A GREAT DEAL OF PERSONAL BUSINESS AND SAW A GREAT MANY MEN WHO WERE DOING INTERESTING THINGS IN HIS OWN PROFESSION
BUT YOU SEE MRS ALEXANDER SUCH A THING NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
THE LAST WEEK HAS BEEN A BAD ONE
HILDA WATCHED HIM WITH PERPLEXITY
WHAT WAS IT THAT REACHED IN OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND THRILLED HIM
BUT I DON'T LIKE IT SO WELL AS THIS BARTLEY HELD THE YELLOW WINE AGAINST THE LIGHT AND SQUINTED INTO IT AS HE TURNED THE GLASS SLOWLY ABOUT
ESPECIALLY HE KNEW EVERYTHING THAT WAS NOT PRINTED IN THE NEWSPAPERS
I AM DELIGHTED
THE SMELL OF THE WOOD SMOKE BLEW IN AT THE WINDOW
BARTLEY WAS MAKING A THIRD ROUND OF THE SQUARE WHEN HE HEARD THE FAR-FLUNG HOOF-BEATS OF A HANSOM-CAB HORSE DRIVEN RAPIDLY
AND BECAUSE I SUFFER HILDA
CHAPTER VI THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
EVEN LUCIUS WILSON DID NOT SEE IN THIS ACCIDENT THE DISASTER HE HAD ONCE FORETOLD
SHE WAS VISITING HER GREAT-AUNT THERE
UPSTAIRS IN WINIFRED'S WINDOW THE LIGHT THAT TOLD HIM SHE WAS STILL AWAKE AND STILL THINKING OF HIM
IN THE AFTERNOON HE WROTE A LONG LETTER TO WINIFRED
IF HE IS BLAMED IF HE NEEDS ANY ONE TO SPEAK FOR HIM,"--FOR THE FIRST TIME HER VOICE BROKE AND A FLUSH OF LIFE TEARFUL PAINFUL AND CONFUSED SWEPT OVER HER RIGID PALLOR,--"IF HE NEEDS ANY ONE TELL ME SHOW ME WHAT TO DO SHE BEGAN TO SOB AND HORTON HURRIED AWAY
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY POOR BARTLEY
HER FATHER AND MOTHER PLAYED IN THE PROVINCES MOST OF THE YEAR AND SHE WAS LEFT A GREAT DEAL IN THE CARE OF AN OLD AUNT WHO WAS CRIPPLED BY RHEUMATISM AND WHO HAD HAD TO LEAVE THE STAGE ALTOGETHER
MORE THAN THIS HE HAD NOT TRIED TO KNOW
BUT AFTERWARD
PUT THE TWO PINK ONES IN THIS ROOM AND THE RED ONE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM A LITTLE BEFORE THREE O'CLOCK MRS ALEXANDER WENT INTO THE LIBRARY TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING WAS READY
YOU ARE OFF FOR ENGLAND ON SATURDAY BARTLEY MRS ALEXANDER TELLS ME YES FOR A FEW WEEKS ONLY
SHE STILL LIVES ABOUT THE QUARTER AND THOUGH THERE IS ALWAYS A SOLDAT SHE HAS BECOME A BLANCHISSEUSE DE FIN
THEY ALWAYS MAKE ME FEEL JAUNTY
SHE PUT THIS ONE DOWN ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF HER WHILE SHE POURED HER TEA
SEE HOW WHITE THE STARS ARE FOR A LONG TIME NEITHER HILDA NOR BARTLEY SPOKE
YOU'VE GOT TO HANG ABOUT FOR ME YOU KNOW
YOU ARE A PLUCKY ONE YOU HE PATTED HER GLOVE WITH HIS HAND
I DON'T TRUST MYSELF ANY MORE
FOR A FEW PLEASURABLE SECONDS HE QUITE FORGOT WHERE HE WAS GOING AND ONLY AFTER THE DOOR HAD CLOSED BEHIND HER DID HE REALIZE THAT THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE TO WHICH HE HAD DIRECTED HIS TRUNK FROM THE SOUTH STATION THAT MORNING
HILDA HAD NEVER REPLIED TO HIS LETTER
HE SHUT HIS EYES AND PRESSED HIS FOREHEAD AGAINST THE COLD WINDOW GLASS BREATHING IN THE CHILL THAT CAME THROUGH IT
YOU MUST STAY PUT NOW THAT I HAVE YOU BACK
WE DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO WITH HIM A SERVANT CAME IN AND NOISELESSLY REMOVED THE TEA-TRAY
I'M GROWING OLDER MY DEAR
THE BRIDGE YOU SEE WAS JUST AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL AND THE NOISE OF THE ENGINES ANNOYED HER VERY MUCH AT FIRST
I'M SORRY I WAS SUCH A SAVAGE
THE COMMON IS BEAUTIFUL
I'M SURE I DID YOU JUSTICE IN THE MATTER OF ABILITY
WINIFRED CAME UP BEHIND HIM AND PUT A HAND ON HIS SHOULDER
I'M GOING NOW SHE TURNED AND HER HAND CLOSED ON THE DOOR-KNOB
IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU ARE TROUBLED AND HARASSED THAT I FEEL WORRIED BARTLEY
SHE SAVES HERSELF FOR IT AND DOESN'T EVEN GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SEEING PEOPLE MUCH
IT ISN'T FAR FROM LONDON AND THEN THE TROUBADOUR BEGINS TO THRILL THE GOLDEN STREET IN THE CITY AS THE SUN SINKS LOW
THESE PINK ROSES JUST CAME FROM MRS HASTINGS SHE SAID SMILING AND I AM SURE SHE MEANT THEM FOR YOU BARTLEY LOOKED ABOUT WITH AN AIR OF SATISFACTION AT THE GREENS AND THE WREATHS IN THE WINDOWS
WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GOSSOONS WHAT SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR
FOR TWO HOURS HE HAD BEEN WATCHING THE LOW DIRTY SKY AND THE BEATING OF THE HEAVY RAIN UPON THE IRON-COLORED SEA
AND HER HANSOM JINGLES ONWARD BUT HER LITTLE JEWELED HAND IS CLENCHED A LITTLE TIGHTER AND SHE CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE WANTS OR WHY SHE WANDERS TO THAT UNDISCOVERED LAND FOR THE PARTIES THERE ARE NOT AT ALL THE SORT OF THING SHE PLANNED IN THE LAND WHERE THE DEAD DREAMS GO
THE YELLOW LIGHT FROM THE STUDENT'S LAMP FELL ON HIS HANDS AND THE PURPLE SLEEVES OF HIS VELVET SMOKING-JACKET BUT HIS FLUSHED FACE AND BIG HARD HEAD WERE IN THE SHADOW
THOUGH I WILL SAY FOR MYSELF THAT I WAS ALWAYS CONFIDENT HE'D DO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY MRS ALEXANDER'S SHOULDERS GAVE A SLIGHT MOVEMENT SUGGESTIVE OF IMPATIENCE
IS THIS THE WAY YOU MEAN TO ANSWER IT HILDA HE ASKED UNSTEADILY
HE WAS CRAMPED IN EVERY WAY BY A NIGGARDLY COMMISSION AND WAS USING LIGHTER STRUCTURAL MATERIAL THAN HE THOUGHT PROPER
IT HAD THE ANGUISH OF A VOICE OF PROPHECY
IF ANY ONE I LOVED SUFFERED LIKE THIS I'D WANT TO KNOW IT
WHEN BARTLEY LOOKED OUT OF HIS WINDOWS FROM THE SAVOY THE RIVER WAS FLASHING SILVER AND THE GRAY STONE ALONG THE EMBANKMENT WAS BATHED IN BRIGHT CLEAR SUNSHINE
I SHALL BE DOWN IN A MOMENT
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY
IF IT WERE TRUE THAT THE COMPRESSION MEMBERS SHOWED STRAIN WITH THE BRIDGE ONLY TWO THIRDS DONE THEN THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT PULL THE WHOLE STRUCTURE DOWN AND BEGIN OVER AGAIN
YET IT WAS TO HIM THE LEAST SATISFACTORY THING HE HAD EVER DONE
THAT EVEN AFTER DINNER WHEN MOST MEN ACHIEVE A DECENT IMPERSONALITY BARTLEY HAD MERELY CLOSED THE DOOR OF THE ENGINE-ROOM AND COME UP FOR AN AIRING
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMEBODY AND THAT IT WASN'T I THEY CROSSED OXFORD STREET IN SILENCE FEELING THEIR WAY
DID SHE EVER GET BACK TO BRITTANY AND HER BAINS DE MER AH NO
THEY SAY HE IS A GOOD ARCHITECT WHEN HE WILL WORK
I GAVE HER A SPRAY OF LILAC I REMEMBER AND YOU GAVE HER A FRANC
SHE DOESN'T DRIFT
WHATEVER SHE WORE PEOPLE FELT THE CHARM OF HER ACTIVE GIRLISH BODY WITH ITS SLENDER HIPS AND QUICK EAGER SHOULDERS
BECAUSE OF HER YOU MEAN WILSON'S BROW WRINKLED
DON'T YOU FEEL IT ALEXANDER WENT OVER AND OPENED THE WINDOW FOR HER
I MUST SEE YOU
I KNEW THAT AUNT ELEANOR HAD FOUND HIM MUCH TO HER TASTE BUT SHE HADN'T SAID ANYTHING
THEY IN THEIR DAY HAD CARRIED THE FLAMING LIQUOR BUT TO-DAY WAS HIS
SHE WAS INTERESTED IN THE ARMY AND IN POLITICS AND SHE HAD A GREAT CONTEMPT FOR MUSIC AND ART AND PHILOSOPHY
IT'S NOT I YOU FEEL SURE OF
ALTHOUGH ALEXANDER WAS ONLY FORTY-THREE WILSON THOUGHT THAT BENEATH HIS VIGOROUS COLOR HE DETECTED THE DULLING WEARINESS OF ON-COMING MIDDLE AGE
BUT IT HAD BROUGHT ONLY POWER THAT WAS IN ITSELF ANOTHER KIND OF RESTRAINT
NO ONE ELSE KNOWS AND I DIDN'T TRY TO FIND OUT ANYTHING
NEVER MENTION IT TO ME HILDA LOOKED APPRECIATIVELY AT THE PROFESSOR'S ALERT FACE WITH SO MANY KINDLY LINES ABOUT THE MOUTH AND SO MANY QUIZZICAL ONES ABOUT THE EYES
BUT IT WAS MORE ACTIVE
WHEN THE WINDOW OPENS I KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT WOULD FEEL TO BE OUT THERE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET YOU'LL FIND IT SHADY IT'S LILAC TIME IN LONDON
THE TRAIN STOPPED AT ALLWAY MILLS THEN WOUND TWO MILES UP THE RIVER AND THEN THE HOLLOW SOUND UNDER HIS FEET TOLD BARTLEY THAT HE WAS ON HIS FIRST BRIDGE AGAIN
WILSON WAS ABLE TO ENJOY LOVELY THINGS THAT PASSED HIM ON THE WING AS COMPLETELY AND DELIBERATELY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DUG-UP MARVELS LONG ANTICIPATED AND DEFINITELY FIXED AT THE END OF A RAILWAY JOURNEY
SHE USED TO DECLARE THAT THE PRINCE CONSORT HAD BROUGHT ALL THAT STUFF OVER OUT OF GERMANY
IT'S ALL NONSENSE TO TRY TO DO WHAT OTHER ENGINEERS ARE DOING WHEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT SOUND BUT JUST NOW WHEN THERE IS SUCH COMPETITION THE YOUNGER MAN DEMURRED
AS THE MUSIC CHANGES LIKE A PRISMATIC GLASS IT TAKES THE LIGHT AND RANGES THROUGH ALL THE MOODS THAT PASS
WHEN AT LAST ALEXANDER ROUSED HIMSELF THE AFTERNOON HAD WANED TO SUNSET
OVERWORK HAD NOT EXHAUSTED HIM
HOW CAN YOU FACE IT ALL WITH SO MUCH FORTITUDE SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH THAT CLEAR GAZE WHICH WILSON HAD SO MUCH ADMIRED WHICH HE HAD FELT IMPLIED SUCH HIGH CONFIDENCE AND FEARLESS PRIDE
WHETHER OR NOT THE FUTURE WAS HIS AS IT SEEMED TO BE
I THOUGHT I SAW YOU IN MACCONNELL'S BOX WITH MAINHALL ONE EVENING BUT I SUPPOSED YOU HAD LEFT TOWN BEFORE THIS SHE LOOKED AT HIM FRANKLY AND CORDIALLY AS IF HE WERE INDEED MERELY AN OLD FRIEND WHOM SHE WAS GLAD TO MEET AGAIN
HE WAS THE ONLY THING SHE COULD SEE FOR THEY WERE MOVING THROUGH A DENSE OPAQUENESS AS IF THEY WERE WALKING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN
EVERY ONE ELSE IS IN BED AND I AM SITTING ALONE IN MY STUDY
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD BEEN THROUGH SOMETHING OF THIS SORT BEFORE
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN A DELIGHTFUL PERSON WINIFRED LAUGHED
LATER AS HE WALKED THE DECK THROUGH A SPLENDID GOLDEN SUNSET HIS SPIRITS ROSE CONTINUALLY
REMEMBERING HILDA AS SHE USED TO BE WAS DOUBTLESS MORE SATISFACTORY THAN SEEING HER AS SHE MUST BE NOW--AND AFTER ALL ALEXANDER ASKED HIMSELF WHAT WAS IT BUT HIS OWN YOUNG YEARS THAT HE WAS REMEMBERING
AS THE TRAIN RUSHED ALONG THE TRESTLES THOUSANDS OF WILD BIRDS ROSE SCREAMING INTO THE LIGHT
BUT HE CONFUSED ME JUST ALEXANDER LAUGHED
WHEN HE REACHED THE ABBEY HE TURNED BACK AND CROSSED WESTMINSTER BRIDGE AND SAT DOWN TO WATCH THE TRAILS OF SMOKE BEHIND THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT CATCH FIRE WITH THE SUNSET
PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT SLEEVE
DON'T FORGET THE STEPLADDER AND PLENTY OF TACKS AND STRING
THROUGH ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF THOSE GRAY DAYS ALEXANDER DROWSED AND MUSED DRINKING IN THE GRATEFUL MOISTURE
WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH AS IF TO DRAW IN AGAIN THE FRAGRANCE OF THOSE DAYS
IN APPEARANCE MAINHALL WAS ASTONISHINGLY LIKE THE CONVENTIONAL STAGE-ENGLISHMAN OF AMERICAN DRAMA
HE BENT OVER IT A LITTLE STIFFLY
THE OTHER MEN DREW BACK A LITTLE TO LET HIM APPROACH
THE SUN SANK RAPIDLY
I WAS SOMEHOW AFRAID THAT MY KNOWING HIM SO WELL WOULD NOT PUT ME IN THE WAY OF GETTING TO KNOW YOU THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU SHE NODDED AT HIM ABOVE HER CUP AND SMILED BUT THERE WAS A LITTLE FORMAL TIGHTNESS IN HER TONE WHICH HAD NOT BEEN THERE WHEN SHE GREETED HIM IN THE HALL
I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW PEOPLE CAN EVER DIE
CAN YOU REALIZE IT HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND TOOK HER HANDS AWAY FROM THE FLOWERS DRYING THEM WITH HIS POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
TEA WAS BROUGHT IN IMMEDIATELY AND PLACED IN FRONT OF THE WOOD FIRE
HAVE YOU BEEN IN PARIS MUCH THESE LATE YEARS HILDA LOWERED ONE OF THE CANDLE-SHADES CAREFULLY
THE RIPPLES GO ON IN ALL OF US
HE SPOKE WITH AN EXTREME OXFORD ACCENT AND WHEN HE WAS TALKING WELL HIS FACE SOMETIMES WORE THE RAPT EXPRESSION OF A VERY EMOTIONAL MAN LISTENING TO MUSIC
PERHAPS HE WILL BE AT THE DOCK
THERE'S A PORTLY MAN OF BUSINESS WITH A BALANCE OF HIS OWN THERE'S A CLERK AND THERE'S A BUTCHER OF A SOFT REPOSEFUL TONE AND THEY'RE ALL THEM RETURNING TO THE HEAVENS THEY HAVE KNOWN
HE LOCKED AND UNLOCKED HIS HANDS OVER THE GRATE AND SPREAD HIS FINGERS CLOSE TO THE BLUISH FLAME WHILE THE COALS CRACKLED AND THE CLOCK TICKED AND A STREET VENDOR BEGAN TO CALL UNDER THE WINDOW
THEY'RE QUITE UNUSUAL AREN'T THEY LADY WESTMERE SENT THEM TO ME FROM ROME LAST CHRISTMAS
YOU'VE REALLY MISSED ME
WE'VE PLENTY OF TIME THEY FOUND ALL LONDON ABROAD
MAINHALL OFFERED TO TAKE ME
POOR OLD HUGH MAINHALL MURMURED
I HAD ENOUGH AND TO SPARE THEN BARTLEY MUSED AND LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY AT HIS CIGAR
THE ONE THING HE HAD REALLY WANTED ALL HIS LIFE WAS TO BE FREE
IN ALL THOSE BUSY SUCCESSFUL YEARS THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING SO GOOD AS THIS HOUR OF WILD LIGHT-HEARTEDNESS
POOR ANGEL
HOWEVER THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE
NOW AT LAST HE FELT SURE OF HIMSELF
I CAME TO TELL YOU THAT I'M WILLING TO DO AS YOU ASKED ME
HE THOUGHT HE HAD CLEARED THEM WHEN THEY BEGAN COMING UP ALL AROUND HIM CLUTCHING AT HIM AND AT EACH OTHER
FOR THE BARGE THE EIGHT THE ISIS AND THE COACH'S WHOOP AND SHOUT FOR THE MINUTE GUN THE COUNTING AND THE LONG DISHEVELED ROUT FOR THE HOWL ALONG THE TOW-PATH AND A FATE THAT'S STILL IN DOUBT FOR A ROUGHENED OAR TO HANDLE AND A RACE TO THINK ABOUT IN THE LAND WHERE THE DEAD DREAMS GO
THANK YOU FOR THIS WALK MY DEAR
HE HAD TAKEN A SEAT IN A DAY-COACH TO AVOID THE RISK OF MEETING ANY ONE HE KNEW AND BECAUSE HE DID NOT WISH TO BE COMFORTABLE
YOU USED TO WANT THEM ALL ALEXANDER'S CHAIR CREAKED
SHE IS GOING TO DO EVERYTHING HERSELF
HE WAS THE LAZIEST FELLOW AT THE BEAUX ARTS
JUST THE FIERY MOMENT
THEY STOOD CLOSE TOGETHER LOOKING OUT INTO THE WAN WATERY SKY BREATHING ALWAYS MORE QUICKLY AND LIGHTLY AND IT SEEMED AS IF ALL THE CLOCKS IN THE WORLD HAD STOPPED
SINCE THEN BARTLEY HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM AS THE ULTIMATE REPOSITORY OF MORTALITY WHERE ALL THE DEAD THINGS IN THE WORLD WERE ASSEMBLED TO MAKE ONE'S HOUR OF YOUTH THE MORE PRECIOUS
IF YOU COME TO ME I'LL DO AS I SEE FIT
FOREVER GOING ON JOURNEYS THAT LED NOWHERE
THE WEARING AWAY OF THINGS UNDER THE IMPACT OF PHYSICAL FORCES WHICH MEN COULD DIRECT BUT NEVER CIRCUMVENT OR DIMINISH
ALEXANDER SAT DOWN AND LEANED HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND
SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
HE THOUGHT AS HE SAT THERE ABOUT A GREAT MANY THINGS
YOU'VE MADE THINGS COME YOUR WAY AND I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D DO IT
I'VE SEEN ALL MY MEN MY PACKING IS DONE AND I GO UP TO LIVERPOOL THIS EVENING
PRODUCED BY AN ANONYMOUS VOLUNTEER AND DAVID WIDGER ALEXANDER'S BRIDGE BY WILLA CATHER ALEXANDER'S BRIDGE BY WILLA CATHER CHAPTER I LATE ONE BRILLIANT APRIL AFTERNOON PROFESSOR LUCIUS WILSON STOOD AT THE HEAD OF CHESTNUT STREET LOOKING ABOUT HIM WITH THE PLEASED AIR OF A MAN OF TASTE WHO DOES NOT VERY OFTEN GET TO BOSTON
TO REMEMBER AND TO RECOMPENSE THE MUSIC EVERMORE FOR WHAT THE COLD MACHINERY FORGETS
SHE ALWAYS SNIFFED WHEN BARTLEY ASKED ME TO PLAY FOR HIM
AREN'T YOU AFRAID TO LET THE WIND LOW LIKE THAT ON YOUR NECK
HE WENT THROUGH COVENT GARDEN TO OXFORD STREET AND AS HE TURNED INTO MUSEUM STREET HE WALKED MORE SLOWLY SMILING AT HIS OWN NERVOUSNESS AS HE APPROACHED THE SULLEN GRAY MASS AT THE END
WHEN THEY REACHED THE OTHER SIDE MACCONNELL SAID SUDDENLY I HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY TERRIBLY DANGEROUSLY HAPPY MAC,"--HILDA SPOKE QUIETLY PRESSING THE ROUGH SLEEVE OF HIS GREATCOAT WITH HER GLOVED HAND
I QUITE DREADED THE HOLIDAYS WITHOUT YOU
AND THERE AS THE MUSIC CHANGES THE SONG RUNS ROUND AGAIN
THAT'S ALL
HE WILL GET A GOOD MANY TRIPS OUT OF THAT TEN THOUSAND
LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT--AND YOUR BOOTS
SOMETIMES A LITTLE JOLT LIKE THAT DOES ONE GOOD
I NEVER USED TO UNDERSTAND HOW WOMEN DID THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I KNOW NOW
BARTLEY LAUGHED
HOW GAY YOUR EYES ARE THIS MORNING HILDA THAT'S BECAUSE I'VE BEEN STUDYING
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T THINK I MADE AN ASS OF MYSELF NOT A BIT OF IT
AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF ERNEST DOWSON ETC
WHEN THOMAS BROUGHT THE LETTERS BARTLEY SANK INTO HIS CHAIR AND RAN THEM OVER RAPIDLY
WHY DEAR ME I DON'T KNOW
YOU'VE CHANGED
ONLY ONE BARTLEY
THEN IN THE EXALTATION OF LOVE MORE THAN EVER IT SEEMED TO HIM TO MEAN DEATH THE ONLY OTHER THING AS STRONG AS LOVE
FROM HIS ABSTRACTION AND THE DETERMINED SET OF HIS JAW THEY FANCIED HE MUST BE THINKING ABOUT HIS BRIDGE
BUT YOU KNOW I NEVER WEAR EARRINGS YES YES I KNOW
GIVE ME MY THINGS PLEASE SHE PUT HER HAND OUT TOWARD THE FENDER
HILDA WAS WRITING IN HER LIVING-ROOM UNDER THE LIGHT OF A TALL DESK LAMP
I SEE YOU MOONING
LISTEN SHE SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO AND SANG
WHEN DID YOU LEARN TO TAKE HOLD OF YOUR PARTS LIKE THAT WHEN I HAD NOTHING ELSE TO THINK OF
SOME WOMEN CAN DO THAT SORT OF THING BUT YOU--YOU CAN LOVE AS QUEENS DID IN THE OLD TIME HILDA HAD HEARD THAT SOFT DEEP TONE IN HIS VOICE ONLY ONCE BEFORE
DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER,"--MAINHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER,--"DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
ANYTHING I DO CAN BE MADE PUBLIC PHIL
YOU'RE WET THROUGH
THEN HE WENT INTO THE SMOKING-ROOM
HE SAT HEAVILY A CIGAR IN HIS LARGE SMOOTH HAND A FLUSH OF AFTER-DINNER COLOR IN HIS FACE WHICH WIND AND SUN AND EXPOSURE TO ALL SORTS OF WEATHER HAD LEFT FAIR AND CLEAR-SKINNED
ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WINIFRED WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD HER THAT THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR,--ONE THING IN PARTICULAR,--AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
THE AUDIENCE HAD COME FOREWARNED EVIDENTLY AND WHENEVER THE RAGGED SLIP OF A DONKEY-GIRL RAN UPON THE STAGE THERE WAS A DEEP MURMUR OF APPROBATION EVERY ONE SMILED AND GLOWED AND MAINHALL HITCHED HIS HEAVY CHAIR A LITTLE NEARER THE BRASS RAILING
YOU WANT TO LOOK DOWN THROUGH MY MEMORY SHE DROPPED HER HANDS IN HER LAP
WHEN SHE IS DUSTING I ALWAYS KNOW WHEN SHE HAS COME TO HIS PICTURE WILSON NODDED
HIS BODY HAD NOT YET BEEN FOUND
HE WAS SITTING SO HIS FACE SHADED BY HIS HAND WHEN THE BOSTON LAWYER SAW HIM FROM THE SIDING AT WHITE RIVER JUNCTION
LIFE SEEMS THE STRONGEST AND MOST INDESTRUCTIBLE THING IN THE WORLD
BUT NOW HE IS STRONG AND SULLEN AND HE IS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE AT THE COST OF MINE
WHEN THEY REACHED THE BRIDGE WORKS ALEXANDER BEGAN HIS EXAMINATION IMMEDIATELY
TAKE IT AND GO
BUT THIS MORNING WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HOLIDAY
SO THE SONG USED TO RUN IN HIS HEAD THOSE SUMMER MORNINGS A DOZEN YEARS AGO
SHE HURRIED TO THE HALL AS ALEXANDER CAME STAMPING IN COVERED WITH SNOW
A MILLION DETAILS DRINK YOU DRY
I DON'T BELIEVE IT AND I KNOW I SHAN'T DIE EVER
DID YOU THINK I HAD FORGOTTEN YOU WERE IN TOWN HILDA
THE NEW NUMBER PROBABLY MEANT INCREASED PROSPERITY
BARTLEY TURNED AWAY FROM HIS WIFE STILL HOLDING HER HAND
SEE THE BARREL ORGAN BY ALFRED NOYES
HE POINTED TO A CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND WENT BACK TO HIS WORKTABLE
WINIFRED STILL WAS AS SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN ROMANCE FOR HIM AND WHENEVER HE WAS DEEPLY STIRRED HE TURNED TO HER
WHEN ALL THAT BLEAKNESS OF GRAY STONE AND DULLNESS OF DIRTY BRICK TREMBLES IN AUREATE LIGHT AND ALL THE ROOFS AND SPIRES AND ONE GREAT DOME ARE FLOATED IN GOLDEN HAZE
PRESENTLY SHE CAME OUT WITH A CHUCKLE
WON'T YOU SIT DOWN HE WAS STANDING BEHIND THE TABLE TURNING OVER A PILE OF BLUEPRINTS NERVOUSLY
I CAN DO THAT I CAN'T HE SAID HEAVILY
FOUR YEARS AGO HE HAD BEEN CALLED TO JAPAN TO DELIVER AT THE EMPEROR'S REQUEST A COURSE OF LECTURES AT THE IMPERIAL UNIVERSITY AND HAD INSTITUTED REFORMS THROUGHOUT THE ISLANDS NOT ONLY IN THE PRACTICE OF BRIDGE-BUILDING BUT IN DRAINAGE AND ROAD-MAKING
AS THE DAY-COACHES AT THE REAR END OF THE LONG TRAIN SWEPT BY HIM THE LAWYER NOTICED AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS A MAN'S HEAD WITH THICK RUMPLED HAIR
DON'T YOU SUPPOSE IT GIVES ME ANY PLEASURE TO DO SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE LIKE DOES IT
HILDA SAID NOTHING AND AS THEY WALKED ON MACCONNELL SPOKE AGAIN APOLOGETICALLY
THAT'S TOO OFTEN
AND THE WHEELING WORLD REMEMBERS ALL THE WHEELING SONG FORGETS
THERE'S A BARREL-ORGAN CAROLING ACROSS A GOLDEN STREET IN THE CITY AS THE SUN SINKS LOW
HE COULD REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW THE WORLD HAD LOOKED THEN
IN THE LIGHT OF HIS EXPERIENCE IT WAS MORE PRECIOUS THAN HONORS OR ACHIEVEMENT
IT DOESN'T BECOME YOU
ALL NIGHT HE WAS ALONE WITH HER IN THE STILL HOUSE HIS GREAT HEAD LYING DEEP IN THE PILLOW
I MUST STOP TO SEND A WIRE ALEXANDER WENT UP TO THE TELEGRAPH-DESK AND PENCILED THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE TO HIS WIFE I MAY HAVE TO BE HERE FOR SOME TIME
I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
BARTLEY WALKED FOR TWO HOURS AND THEN STRETCHED HIMSELF IN THE SUN UNTIL LUNCH-TIME
ALEXANDER ANNOYED BY MAINHALL'S SIGHS AND EXCLAMATIONS WATCHED HER WITH KEEN HALF-SKEPTICAL INTEREST
SHE WENT AWAY ON LADY WALFORD'S ARM AND AS HE STOOD WATCHING HER YELLOW TRAIN GLIDE DOWN THE LONG FLOOR HE LOOKED RATHER SULLEN
YOU'LL BE HAVING A GREAT NIGHT TO-MORROW SHE PUT OUT HER HAND
THINGS THAT COULD BE BOUGHT IN THE MARKET
IT'S TOO LATE TO ASK THAT
FOR SOME REASON HE FELT PLEASED AND FLATTERED BY THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE AUDIENCE
HE KISSED HER JOYFULLY AND BRUSHED AWAY THE SNOW THAT FELL ON HER HAIR
IT'S WINIFRED
BARTLEY IF I'D HAD MY CHOICE OF ALL POSSIBLE PLACES IN WHICH TO SPEND CHRISTMAS YOUR HOUSE WOULD CERTAINLY BE THE PLACE I'D HAVE CHOSEN
THE TRAIN WAS PASSING THROUGH A GRAY COUNTRY AND THE SKY OVERHEAD WAS FLUSHED WITH A WIDE FLOOD OF CLEAR COLOR
MORE AND MORE OFTEN WHEN HE FIRST WAKENED IN THE MORNING OR WHEN HE STEPPED INTO A WARM PLACE AFTER BEING CHILLED ON THE DECK HE FELT A SUDDEN PAINFUL DELIGHT AT BEING NEARER ANOTHER SHORE
MOST WOMEN LOOK SILLY IN THEM
HARDSHIPS AND DIFFICULTIES HE HAD CARRIED LIGHTLY
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT LOOKS SO JOLLY THANK YOU
HAVE YOU A MOMENT WINIFRED
I AM SURE OF YOU ALEXANDER LAUGHED
IT'S DIFFERENT NOW
AND I'VE TRAVELED A BIT TOO MARIE OPENED THE DOOR AND SMILINGLY ANNOUNCED THAT DINNER WAS SERVED
SHE ROSE UNCERTAINLY TOUCHED HIS HAIR WITH HER HAND THEN SANK BACK UPON HER STOOL
BUT THE MOORLOCK BRIDGE IS A CONTINUAL ANXIETY
YOU SEE I'M COMING ON I'VE SEEN NOTHING ELSE
WHEN MARIE MET HIM AT THE DOOR EVEN HER STRONG SENSE OF THE PROPRIETIES COULD NOT RESTRAIN HER SURPRISE AND DELIGHT
IT'S THE AIR OF THE WHOLE PLACE HERE THAT I LIKE
IT WAS NOT UNTIL LONG AFTERWARD THAT ALEXANDER LEARNED THAT FOR HIM THIS YOUTH WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS OF COMPANIONS
IF HIS MIND NOW AND AGAIN PICKED A FACE OUT OF THE GRAYNESS IT WAS LUCIUS WILSON'S OR THE FACE OF AN OLD SCHOOLMATE FORGOTTEN FOR YEARS
THEY HAVEN'T FOUND HIM YET
THERE WAS A BURST OF SHOUTING THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY DROWNED BY THE SCREAM AND CRACKING OF TEARING IRON AS ALL THE TENSION WORK BEGAN TO PULL ASUNDER
TO ALL THE SPIRITUAL ASPECTS OF LIFE
HE STOOD HIS GROUND OVER BY THE WINDOWS UNTIL HILDA CAME IN
I WISH YOU ALWAYS SEEMED AS YOU DO TO-NIGHT
AND IT WAS THINKING OF THAT THAT HE AT LAST FELL ASLEEP
HE FLATTERS HIMSELF THAT IT IS A LITTLE ON HIS ACCOUNT THAT YOU HAVE COME TO THIS CONGRESS OF PSYCHOLOGISTS IT IS WILSON ASSENTED SELECTING HIS MUFFIN CAREFULLY
WHY DO YOU LOOK AT THE FLOWERS SO CRITICALLY
THE LIFE THEY LED TOGETHER SEEMED TO HIM BEAUTIFUL
IT SEEMS THAT A MAN IS MEANT TO LIVE ONLY ONE LIFE IN THIS WORLD
WHAT SPLENDID ONES
HE SENT UP HIS CARD BUT IT CAME BACK TO HIM WITH A MESSAGE SCRIBBLED ACROSS THE FRONT
LADY WESTMERE IS VERY FOND OF HILDA WHEN THEY REACHED THEIR BOX THE HOUSE WAS DARKENED AND THE ORCHESTRA WAS PLAYING THE CLOAK OF OLD GAUL IN A MOMENT PEGGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLAUDED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST
YOUR LIFE KEEPS GOING FOR THINGS YOU DON'T WANT AND ALL THE WHILE YOU ARE BEING BUILT ALIVE INTO A SOCIAL STRUCTURE YOU DON'T CARE A RAP ABOUT
SIT DOWN AND TELL ME EVERYTHING I THINK I'D RATHER MOVE ABOUT IF YOU DON'T MIND
WENT TO ESCAPE THE HOT WEATHER MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
SHE PLAYED BRILLIANTLY AND WITH GREAT MUSICAL FEELING
I NEVER HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH A JOB BEFORE ALEXANDER MOVED ABOUT RESTLESSLY AND FELL TO POKING THE FIRE
YOU'VE HELPED ME OVER A GOOD MANY CHRISTMASES SHE SMILED AT HIM GAYLY
ALEXANDER FELT THE NEED OF EXERCISE EVEN BEFORE HE CAME OUT OF HIS CABIN
BUT HE DID NOT GO SO FAR
I HAPPEN TO HAVE MACCONNELL'S BOX FOR TONIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
PEACE IS WHERE I AM NOT
BEFORE HE WENT BELOW A FEW BRIGHT STARS WERE PRICKED OFF BETWEEN HEAVILY MOVING MASSES OF CLOUD
I ONLY CAME IN TO SEE WHETHER YOU AND PROFESSOR WILSON WERE QUITE COMFORTABLE
I HAVE BEEN REALIZING HOW THINGS USED TO BE WITH ME
SHE'S A DEAR UNWORLDLY LITTLE THING SAID THE PHILOSOPHER ABSENTLY
I WAS AFRAID THAT YOU MIGHT GET HERE BEFORE I DID
HE FOUND HIMSELF LIVING EXACTLY THE KIND OF LIFE HE HAD DETERMINED TO ESCAPE
I LIKE THESE LITTLE YELLOW IRISES ROOMS ALWAYS LOOK BETTER BY LAMPLIGHT--IN LONDON AT LEAST
THIS FEELING WAS THE ONLY HAPPINESS THAT WAS REAL TO HIM AND SUCH HOURS WERE THE ONLY ONES IN WHICH HE COULD FEEL HIS OWN CONTINUOUS IDENTITY--FEEL THE BOY HE HAD BEEN IN THE ROUGH DAYS OF THE OLD WEST FEEL THE YOUTH WHO HAD WORKED HIS WAY ACROSS THE OCEAN ON A CATTLE-SHIP AND GONE TO STUDY IN PARIS WITHOUT A DOLLAR IN HIS POCKET
I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU
AND HIS HAND BEGINS TO TREMBLE AND HIS FACE IS RATHER RED AS HE SEES A LOAFER WATCHING HIM AND--THERE HE TURNS HIS HEAD AND STARES INTO THE SUNSET WHERE HIS APRIL LOVE IS FLED FOR HE HEARS HER SOFTLY SINGING AND HIS LONELY SOUL IS LED THROUGH THE LAND WHERE THE DEAD DREAMS GO
BUT MRS ALEXANDER NEVER SUGGESTED IT WHY WILSON WAS A LITTLE STARTLED BY HER TONE AND HE TURNED HIS HEAD SO QUICKLY THAT HIS CUFF-LINK CAUGHT THE STRING OF HIS NOSE-GLASSES AND PULLED THEM AWRY
NEXT WEEK WOULD BE TIME ENOUGH THAT WOULD ONLY MEAN STARTING TWICE
HE CROSSED BEDFORD SQUARE AND FOUND THE NUMBER HE WAS LOOKING FOR
FORTUNE WHICH HAD SMILED UPON HIM CONSISTENTLY ALL HIS LIFE DID NOT DESERT HIM IN THE END
IT'S UNBEARABLE
BARTLEY MAKES ME FEEL A FADED MONOCHROME
I SHOULD REALLY HAVE LIKED TO GO UP THERE
IT REALLY WAS A BRIDGE INTO THE FUTURE
ONE TREMBLED LEST BEFORE HE GOT OUT IT MIGHT SOMEHOW ESCAPE HIM LEST HE MIGHT DROP THE GLASS FROM OVER-EAGERNESS AND SEE IT SHIVERED ON THE STONE FLOOR AT HIS FEET
YOU'VE BEEN SENDING ME FAR TOO MANY FLOWERS BARTLEY
HE SAYS I OUGHT TO BE MINDING THE PIGS AT HOME AND I SUPPOSE I OUGHT
ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME LOVE YOU A LITTLE BARTLEY SHE WHISPERED
HE STRUCK THE WATER WITHOUT INJURY AND DISAPPEARED
I DINED WITH HER AND HAD TEA THERE A DOZEN DIFFERENT TIMES I SHOULD THINK
OH WHAT A GRAND THING TO HAPPEN ON A RAW DAY
I DON'T YOU KNOW THINK WE OUGHT TO BE HARD ON HER
I COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT I WAS TO SEE MRS BARTLEY AGAIN SO SOON THANK YOU WILSON
HE HAD LAST WRITTEN TO HER FROM CANADA AFTER HE FIRST MET WINIFRED TELLING HER THAT EVERYTHING WAS CHANGED WITH HIM--THAT HE HAD MET A WOMAN WHOM HE WOULD MARRY IF HE COULD
AT FIRST HE SEEMED ONLY A PLEASURE-LOVING SIMPLETON OF WHOSE COMPANY I WAS RATHER ASHAMED AND WHOM I USED TO HIDE UNDER MY COAT WHEN I WALKED THE EMBANKMENT IN LONDON
I'VE BEEN SITTING IN THE TRAIN FOR A WEEK IT SEEMS TO ME WILSON STOOD BEFORE THE FIRE WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND LOOKED ABOUT THE ROOM
HILDA LAUGHED AS SHE CAREFULLY POURED HIS CREAM
THEN CAME ALL THOSE YEARS WITHOUT YOU LONELY AND HURT AND DISCOURAGED
THE FOG'S THICKER THAN EVER HILDA
HE'S COMING ON TO SETTLE UP THE ESTATE
IT DOESN'T TAKE PLUCK TO FIGHT FOR ONE'S MOMENT BUT IT TAKES PLUCK TO GO WITHOUT--A LOT
AND SO HAVE I
HAVE YOU BEEN IN LONDON LONG BARTLEY BOWED SOMEWHAT LABORIOUSLY OVER HER HAND
THERE AREN'T MANY SUCH LEFT
ON OTHER MATTERS HE WAS PERFECTLY RATIONAL AND HE WAS EASY AND PLEASING IN CONVERSATION
HE HATED THEM WHEN THEY PRESUMED TO BE ANYTHING ELSE
AND YOU'LL NEVER BRING HILDA OUT LIKE THIS AGAIN
I'VE LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS HOUR ALL DAY MRS ALEXANDER SMILED AT HIM ACROSS THE VAPOR FROM THE KETTLE
THERE THAT WILL DO
WHAT A SHOCKING WHILE YOU TAKE I'M IN NO HURRY
LONDON ALWAYS MAKES ME WANT TO LIVE MORE THAN ANY OTHER CITY IN THE WORLD
SHE HADN'T MUCH AMBITION THEN AND SHE WAS TOO FOND OF TRIFLES
HE SHOUTED AND RAN AFTER THE SECOND GANG BUT BY THIS TIME EVERY ONE KNEW THAT THE BIG RIVER SPAN WAS SLOWLY SETTLING
AND HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT HAD COME ABOUT
HERE'S A NOTE FROM OLD WILSON
ON MONDAY NIGHT HE HAD WRITTEN A LONG LETTER TO HIS WIFE BUT WHEN MORNING CAME HE WAS AFRAID TO SEND IT AND THE LETTER WAS STILL IN HIS POCKET
IT'S LIKE A FINE APRIL DAY AT HOME
THAT WOULD HARDLY BE SAFE EVEN FOR LADY WALFORD IN A GREAT HOUSE LIKE THIS SUNDAY AFTERNOON THEN SAID ALEXANDER AS SHE ROSE TO JOIN HER HOSTESS
COME THE CARRIAGE IS WAITING
THERE IS TOO MUCH COLOR IN THAT ROOM FOR A RED ONE YOU KNOW BARTLEY BEGAN TO SORT THE GREENS
HILDA PULLED DOWN HER VEIL AND THEY STEPPED OUT INTO THE THICK BROWN WASH THAT SUBMERGED ST MARTIN'S LANE
WILSON KNEW THAT HILDA HAD LOVED HIM
WHAT CAN HAVE DETAINED HIM
WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE ETCHINGS
WHEN THE TELEGRAM ARRIVED ALEXANDER WAS AT HIS ROOMS ON TENTH STREET PACKING HIS BAG TO GO TO BOSTON
TRY HIM ONCE AGAIN SHE LOOKED UP INTO HIS EYES AND HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS
WITH A DIFFERENCE
I'LL RING FOR THOMAS TO CLEAR AWAY THIS LITTER
THAT CONSCIOUSNESS WAS LIFE ITSELF
AND THEY'VE GIVEN IT A GLORY AND A PART TO PLAY AGAIN IN THE SYMPHONY THAT RULES THE DAY AND THE NIGHT
WHEN HE SANK HIS WIFE SEEMED TO BE THERE IN THE WATER BESIDE HIM TELLING HIM TO KEEP HIS HEAD THAT IF HE COULD HOLD OUT THE MEN WOULD DROWN AND RELEASE HIM
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN TO A MAN WHO HAD LIVED THROUGH THAT MAGICAL SPRING AND SUMMER AND WHO HAD FELT THAT THE STARS THEMSELVES WERE BUT FLAMING PARTICLES IN THE FAR-AWAY INFINITUDES OF HIS LOVE
CHAPTER III THE NEXT EVENING ALEXANDER DINED ALONE AT A CLUB AND AT ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK HE DROPPED IN AT THE DUKE OF YORK'S
THOSE DECENT YOUNG FELLOWS AND POOR MAC AND ME NEVER HEEDING--HARD AS A STEEL SPRING
HER PRIMROSE SATIN GOWN SEEMED LIKE A SOFT SHEATH FOR HER SLENDER SUPPLE FIGURE AND ITS DELICATE COLOR SUITED HER WHITE IRISH SKIN AND BROWN HAIR
BUT PREDICTING IN THE CASE OF BOYS IS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE MRS ALEXANDER
IF YOU PLEASE THAT IS EXACTLY WHY YOU WISH TO SEE ME
HE HAPPENED TO BE ENGAGED IN WORK OF PUBLIC UTILITY BUT HE WAS NOT WILLING TO BECOME WHAT IS CALLED A PUBLIC MAN
AND BOLDER KNIGHTS TO BATTLE GO WITH SWORD AND SHIELD AND LANCE THAN EVER HERE ON EARTH BELOW HAVE WHIRLED INTO--A DANCE GO DOWN TO KEW IN LILAC TIME
UNDER HIS TUMBLED SANDY HAIR HIS HEAD SEEMED AS HARD AND POWERFUL AS A CATAPULT AND HIS SHOULDERS LOOKED STRONG ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES TO SUPPORT A SPAN OF ANY ONE OF HIS TEN GREAT BRIDGES THAT CUT THE AIR ABOVE AS MANY RIVERS
HELLO WILSON
THOUGH THE MUSIC'S ONLY VERDI THERE'S A WORLD TO MAKE IT SWEET JUST AS YONDER YELLOW SUNSET WHERE THE EARTH AND HEAVEN MEET MELLOWS ALL THE SOOTY CITY
THAT WAS WHERE I HAD MY LAST LONG TALK WITH HIM
I KNOW A GOOD DEAL ABOUT PICTURES HILDA SHOOK HER LARGE HAT AS SHE DREW THE ROSES OUT OF THE TALL GLASS
AFTER ALL HE REFLECTED THERE'S SMALL PROBABILITY OF HER RECOGNIZING ME
HE WAS A NATURAL FORCE CERTAINLY BUT BEYOND THAT WILSON FELT HE WAS NOT ANYTHING VERY REALLY OR FOR VERY LONG AT A TIME
AND IT HAS LEFT HER CHILLED
THEN YOU CAN'T HAVE HEARD MUCH AT ALL MY DEAR ALEXANDER
EXACTLY HE ASSENTED WARMLY
THIS NEW FEELING WAS SO FRESH SO UNSATISFIED AND LIGHT OF FOOT
THE THREE LINES IN HIS FOREHEAD DIRECTLY ABOVE THE NOSE DEEPENED AS HE SAT THINKING AND HIS POWERFUL HEAD DROOPED FORWARD HEAVILY
THERE WERE OTHER BRIDGE-BUILDERS IN THE WORLD CERTAINLY BUT IT WAS ALWAYS ALEXANDER'S PICTURE THAT THE SUNDAY SUPPLEMENT MEN WANTED BECAUSE HE LOOKED AS A TAMER OF RIVERS OUGHT TO LOOK
AFTER DINNER ALEXANDER CAME BACK TO THE WET DECK PILED HIS DAMP RUGS OVER HIM AGAIN AND SAT SMOKING LOSING HIMSELF IN THE OBLITERATING BLACKNESS AND DROWSING IN THE RUSH OF THE GALE
SHE DOUBTLESS HASN'T THOUGHT OF ME FOR YEARS HE FELT THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE HOUSE AT ONCE AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS CAUGHT UP BY THE CURRENT OF MACCONNELL'S IRRESISTIBLE COMEDY
WILL YOU LET ME TAKE YOU HOME HOW GOOD OF YOU MAC
HE'S A BIG HANDSOME CREATURE AND HE HATES AMERICANS AS MUCH AS EVER
IT'S BECAUSE YOU SEEM TOO CLOSE TO ME TOO MUCH MY OWN KIND
NO SHE GASPED
HE SAT BEFORE THE FIRE HIS SHOULDERS DEEP IN THE CUSHIONS OF HIS CHAIR HIS POWERFUL HEAD UPRIGHT HIS HAIR RUMPLED ABOVE HIS BROAD FOREHEAD
WHEN THE SMOKY VAPORS BECOME FLUTTERING GOLDEN CLOUDS NACREOUS VEILS OF PINK AND AMBER
MAINHALL INDEED KNEW ALMOST EVERY ONE AND HE BABBLED ON INCONTINENTLY SCREWING HIS SMALL HEAD ABOUT OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR
THEY HAD MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN THEIR MEMORIES OF A COMMON FRIEND
A FOOT OF SNOW HAD FALLEN DURING THE MORNING AND THE WIDE SPACE OVER THE RIVER WAS THICK WITH FLYING FLAKES THAT FELL AND WREATHED THE MASSES OF FLOATING ICE
THE LITTLE BOY DRANK OF THE PRETTIEST BROOK IN THE FOREST AND HE BECAME A STAG
CAN THAT HE MURMURED IN AMAZEMENT,--"CAN THAT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN MRS ALEXANDER WHEN THE SERVANT ADMITTED HIM MRS ALEXANDER WAS STILL STANDING IN THE HALLWAY
THE FINE WEATHER MUST HAVE THAWED THEM OUT
HOW COULD HE ENDURE THE BASENESS OF LIFE WITHOUT IT
WE CAN GO MAD WITH JOY AS THE PEOPLE DO OUT IN THE FIELDS ON A FINE WHITSUNDAY
WE ALWAYS HAD OUR TEA OUT OF THOSE BLUE CUPS WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL SOMETIMES IN THE QUEEREST LODGINGS AND SOMETIMES ON A TRUNK AT THE THEATRE--QUEER THEATRES FOR THAT MATTER IT WAS A WONDERFUL LITTLE DINNER
HIS SHOULDERS WERE SUNK DEEP IN THE CUSHIONS AND ONE HAND HUNG LARGE AND PASSIVE OVER THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR
A HOUSE LIKE THIS THROWS ITS WARMTH OUT
UNDER THE ACTIVITIES OF THAT MACHINE THE PERSON WHO IN SUCH MOMENTS AS THIS HE FELT TO BE HIMSELF WAS FADING AND DYING
THOSE THINGS ARE AWFULLY TRYING
IT WAS VERY STIMULATING FOR SHE COULDN'T TOLERATE STUPIDITY IT MUST HAVE BEEN THEN THAT YOUR LUCK BEGAN BARTLEY SAID WILSON FLICKING HIS CIGAR ASH WITH HIS LONG FINGER
THE MEN IN THE END GANG PICKED UP THEIR TOOLS AND GLANCING CURIOUSLY AT EACH OTHER STARTED BACK ACROSS THE BRIDGE TOWARD THE RIVER-BANK
IT WAS TO HAVE REACHED YOU ON THE STEAMER
THE LONG BROWN ROOM BREATHED THE PEACE OF A RICH AND AMPLY GUARDED QUIET
MACKELLER BARTLEY'S FIRST CHIEF WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF MY AUNT AND HE TOLD HER THAT BARTLEY WAS A WILD ILL-GOVERNED YOUTH WHICH REALLY PLEASED HER VERY MUCH
ONLY NOT MAC
OH HOW FINE IT ALL IS YOUR COMING ON LIKE THIS
HE HAD ALWAYS MEANT TO KEEP HIS PERSONAL LIBERTY AT ALL COSTS AS OLD MACKELLER HIS FIRST CHIEF HAD DONE AND NOT LIKE SO MANY AMERICAN ENGINEERS TO BECOME A PART OF A PROFESSIONAL MOVEMENT A CAUTIOUS BOARD MEMBER A NESTOR DE PONTIBUS
ALEXANDER HURRIED TOWARD HER AND TOOK HER GENTLY BY THE ARM
AND HOW GOOD IT WAS TO TURN ONE'S BACK UPON ALL THAT VAULTED COLD TO TAKE HILDA'S ARM AND HURRY OUT OF THE GREAT DOOR AND DOWN THE STEPS INTO THE SUNLIGHT AMONG THE PIGEONS--TO KNOW THAT THE WARM AND VITAL THING WITHIN HIM WAS STILL THERE AND HAD NOT BEEN SNATCHED AWAY TO FLUSH CAESAR'S LEAN CHEEK OR TO FEED THE VEINS OF SOME BEARDED ASSYRIAN KING
AND THE MUSIC'S NOT IMMORTAL
SOMETIMES I GO BY MYSELF WHEN I AM PARTICULARLY LONELY VERY WELL THE SOLE'S GOOD THERE
THE NEXT NIGHT AND THE NEXT ALEXANDER REPEATED THIS SAME FOOLISH PERFORMANCE
WHAT MUST I DO THAT I'VE NOT DONE OR WHAT MUST I NOT DO SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
NO I'M NOT
BUT I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOU
BUT ALEXANDER CUT HIM SHORT
IT GIVES HER A FIXED STAR TO STEER BY
THE WORK OF RECOVERING THE DEAD WENT ON ALL DAY AND ALL THE FOLLOWING NIGHT
AND THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING UNCONQUERED IN HIM SOMETHING BESIDES THE STRONG WORK-HORSE THAT HIS PROFESSION HAD MADE OF HIM
HALF AN HOUR LATER THE TRAIN STOPPED AT MOORLOCK
THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY HIS WIFE'S FORTUNE AND POSITION WERE SOMETIMES DISTRACTING TO A MAN WHO FOLLOWED HIS PROFESSION AND HE WAS EXPECTED TO BE INTERESTED IN A GREAT MANY WORTHY ENDEAVORS ON HER ACCOUNT AS WELL AS ON HIS OWN
SOMETIMES I GET USED TO BEING DEAD INSIDE BUT LATELY IT HAS BEEN AS IF A WINDOW BESIDE ME HAD SUDDENLY OPENED AND AS IF ALL THE SMELLS OF SPRING BLEW IN TO ME
HE'S HIT TERRIBLY HARD
THE CRACK IN THE WALL THE CRASH THE CLOUD OF DUST
IMMEDIATELY THE RIVER WAS FULL OF DROWNING MEN
THOMAS I AM GOING DOWN TO THE KITCHEN NOW TO SEE NORAH
WINIFRED WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW WHEN SHE HEARD THE FRONT DOOR OPEN
YOU'VE HAD A BUSY MORNING AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE TIRED TO-NIGHT AFTER HIS WIFE WENT UPSTAIRS ALEXANDER WORKED ENERGETICALLY AT THE GREENS FOR A FEW MOMENTS
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL THAT IT HAS ITS COMPENSATIONS I SHOULD THINK
IT WAS AS IF HE HAD TRICKED AND OUTWITTED TORTURING MEMORIES HAD ACTUALLY MANAGED TO GET ON BOARD WITHOUT THEM
HER LIPS AND EYELIDS TREMBLED
IT IS THE THING THAT TAKES US FORWARD WILSON THOUGHT SHE SPOKE A LITTLE WISTFULLY
THE BARREL ORGAN BY ALFRED NOYES THERE'S A BARREL-ORGAN CAROLING ACROSS A GOLDEN STREET IN THE CITY AS THE SUN SINKS LOW
MISS BURGOYNE AND HER DONKEY WERE THRUSTING THEIR HEADS IN AT THE HALF DOOR
WON'T YOU SMOKE MR WILSON WILSON LIT A CIGARETTE
BELIEVE ME YOU WILL HATE ME THEN
WHEN IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE AND HIS CHEST WAS ABOUT TO HEAVE HE THOUGHT HE HEARD HIS WIFE TELLING HIM THAT HE COULD HOLD OUT A LITTLE LONGER
NO IT ISN'T A DRESS-UP PART
I SHALL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE THE GROUP OF MEN DOWN UNDER THE RIVERBANK FELL BACK WHEN THEY SAW A WOMAN COMING AND ONE OF THEM THREW A TARPAULIN OVER THE STRETCHER
THE PARKS WERE FULL OF CHILDREN AND NURSEMAIDS AND JOYFUL DOGS THAT LEAPED AND YELPED AND SCRATCHED UP THE BROWN EARTH WITH THEIR PAWS
OH I'M NOT SO VAIN
THAT MOORLOCK BRIDGE IS ON MY BACK ALL THE TIME
JUST STAY ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN HEAR HER AND GO IN IF SHE WANTS YOU EVERYTHING HAPPENED AS ALEXANDER HAD FORESEEN IN THAT MOMENT OF PRESCIENCE UNDER THE RIVER
HILDA WAS A GOOD STORY-TELLER
THE BUSSES HAD STOPPED RUNNING AND THE CAB-DRIVERS WERE LEADING THEIR HORSES
MORE THAN FAIR
HE WONDERED TO-NIGHT AS HE POURED HIS WINE HOW MANY TIMES HE HAD THOUGHT OF HILDA IN THE LAST TEN YEARS
HE HAD BEEN IN LONDON MORE OR LESS BUT HE HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO HEAR OF HER
HE HAD SHUT HIS EYES TO GIVE HIM THE COURAGE HE REMEMBERED AND SHE HAD TREMBLED SO BARTLEY STARTED WHEN HILDA RANG THE LITTLE BELL BESIDE HER
WHEN I KNEW HER SHE WAS LITTLE AND FRAGILE VERY PINK AND WHITE WITH A SPLENDID HEAD AND A FACE LIKE FINE OLD LACE SOMEHOW,--BUT PERHAPS I ALWAYS THINK OF THAT BECAUSE SHE WORE A LACE SCARF ON HER HAIR
HE FELT THAT HE KNEW PRETTY MUCH WHAT SHE DEMANDED IN PEOPLE AND WHAT SHE DEMANDED FROM LIFE AND HE WONDERED HOW SHE SQUARED BARTLEY
I FOUND THE LONG RAILWAY JOURNEYS TRYING
NOT ABOUT SOME THINGS AT ANY RATE
ALEXANDER WALKED BY THE PLACE VERY QUIETLY AS IF HE WERE AFRAID OF WAKING SOME ONE
AND FOR WHAT
WON'T IT BE JOLLY TO HAVE HIM AND HOW FINE THAT HE'S COME INTO A LITTLE MONEY
THEY HOLD ME TO THE SCALE I'VE USED IN SHORTER BRIDGES
WE HAD ONLY A FEW DAYS AND YOUR NEW PLAY WAS JUST ON AND YOU WERE SO HAPPY YES I WAS HAPPY WASN'T I SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE
NEW ONES EVERY DAY
ABOUT HIS OWN YOUTH AND HILDA'S
THERE WAS A STATEROOM UNOCCUPIED AND HE TOOK IT AND SET ABOUT CHANGING HIS CLOTHES
AH IF ONE COULD PROMISE ANY ONE BETTER LUCK IF ONE COULD ASSURE A SINGLE HUMAN BEING OF HAPPINESS
THE YELLOW LIGHT POURED THROUGH THE TREES AND THE LEAVES SEEMED TO BURN WITH SOFT FIRES
THE PRELIMINARIES ONCE OVER THEY CAME TO DEPEND A GREAT DEAL UPON EACH OTHER AND WILSON AFTER HIS DAY'S READING OFTEN WENT ROUND TO BEDFORD SQUARE FOR HIS TEA
ALL THE SAME SING IT HILDA HILDA STARTED UP FROM THE STOOL AND MOVED RESTLESSLY TOWARD THE WINDOW
HE HAD ALREADY FIXED HIS SHARP EYE UPON THE HOUSE WHICH HE REASONED SHOULD BE HIS OBJECTIVE POINT WHEN HE NOTICED A WOMAN APPROACHING RAPIDLY FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
WHEN THE BEARERS PUT THE STRETCHER DOWN IN HORTON'S SPARE BEDROOM SHE THANKED THEM AND GAVE HER HAND TO EACH IN TURN
MY DEAR MR ALEXANDER YOU HAVE STRANGE DELICACIES
IT IS OVER THE WILDEST RIVER WITH MISTS AND CLOUDS ALWAYS BATTLING ABOUT IT AND IT IS AS DELICATE AS A COBWEB HANGING IN THE SKY
BUT I DOUBT WHETHER I HAVE COLOR ENOUGH IN ME
HE LIKED THE SUGGESTION OF STORMY POSSIBILITIES IN THE PROUD CURVE OF HER LIP AND NOSTRIL
HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY
SHE WOULD NOT BE HOME FOR A GOOD TWO HOURS YET AND HE MIGHT AS WELL WALK OVER AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE PLACE
THEY SAVED THAT FOR THE DEEP MOMENTS WHICH DO NOT COME OFTEN AND THEN THEIR TALK OF HIM WAS MOSTLY SILENCE
AND ALWAYS THERE WAS THE SOUND OF THE RUSHING WATER UNDERNEATH THE SOUND WHICH MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE MEANT DEATH
HE WOULD BE DESTROYING HIMSELF AND HIS OWN HAPPINESS
HE FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE DRAWING-ROOM INTO THE LIBRARY WHERE THE WIDE BACK WINDOWS LOOKED OUT UPON THE GARDEN AND THE SUNSET AND A FINE STRETCH OF SILVER-COLORED RIVER
I'LL HAVE MY COFFEE FIRST PHILIP
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND DIGNIFIED SORROW I'VE EVER KNOWN
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW SWEET THEY SMELLED INDEED I DO
MY DEAR HILDA IT IS AFTER TWELVE O'CLOCK
IT WAS QUITE DARK AND ALEXANDER WAS STILL THINKING OF THE BOYS WHEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE TRAIN MUST BE NEARING ALLWAY
MAMIE HE SAID TO HIS WIFE WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE SPARE ROOM HALF AN HOUR LATER WILL YOU TAKE MRS ALEXANDER THE THINGS SHE NEEDS
WITH THE WILD AND EMPTY SORROW OF THE LOVE THAT BLIGHTS AND SEARS OH AND IF SHE HURRIES ONWARD THEN BE SURE BE SURE SHE HEARS HEARS AND BEARS THE BITTER BURDEN OF THE UNFORGOTTEN YEARS AND HER LAUGH'S A LITTLE HARSHER AND HER EYES ARE BRIMMED WITH TEARS FOR THE LAND WHERE THE DEAD DREAMS GO
I HAD BEEN STUDYING IN VIENNA AND SHE THOUGHT THAT ABSURD
AMID THIS LIGHT AND WARMTH AND FRIENDLINESS HE SOMETIMES STARTED AND SHUDDERED AS IF SOME ONE HAD STEPPED ON HIS GRAVE
I LOVE IT AND I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE WITH ANY ONE BUT YOU
GO ON PLEASE AND TELL ME HOW IT WAS WELL IT WAS LIKE THAT
WHEN HE CAME BACK AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON HE WAS CARRYING HIS HAT IN HIS HAND AND WINIFRED KNEW AS SOON AS SHE SAW HIM THAT THEY HAD FOUND BARTLEY
COME DOWN TO KEW IN LILAC TIME
COME DOWN TO KEW IN LILAC TIME
COME DOWN TO KEW IN LILAC TIME
COME DOWN TO KEW IN LILAC TIME
COME DOWN TO KEW IN LILAC TIME
COME DOWN TO KEW IN LILAC TIME
IN LILAC TIME
IN LILAC TIME
IN LILAC TIME
IN LILAC TIME
IN LILAC TIME
IN LILAC TIME
IN LILAC TIME
IN LILAC TIME
THE MACHINERY ITSELF WAS STILL POUNDING ON
B.A
THEY DREW NEAR IT AND WALKED ABOUT IT BUT NONE OF THEM VENTURED TO PEER WITHIN
THERE WAS A BLURRED RHYTHM IN ALL THE DULL CITY NOISES--IN THE CLATTER OF THE CAB HORSES AND THE RUMBLING OF THE BUSSES IN THE STREET CALLS AND IN THE UNDULATING TRAMP TRAMP OF THE CROWD
THEY CHANGED LIKE THAT
AND THERE YOU SEE ON THE HILL IS MY AUNT'S HOUSE WILSON TOOK UP THE PHOTOGRAPH
MY DINING-ROOM HILDA EXPLAINED AS SHE LED THE WAY IS THE TINIEST PLACE YOU HAVE EVER SEEN IT WAS A TINY ROOM HUNG ALL ROUND WITH FRENCH PRINTS ABOVE WHICH RAN A SHELF FULL OF CHINA
WHAT DO YOU MEAN MAC HILDA ASKED NERVOUSLY
SHE PULLED THE WINDOW SHADES HIGH FOR THE WEATHER WAS DARK AND STORMY AND THERE WAS LITTLE LIGHT EVEN IN THE STREETS
ALEXANDER STILL STANDING AT THE END OF THE RIVER SPAN SAW THE LOWER CHORD OF THE CANTILEVER ARM GIVE A LITTLE LIKE AN ELBOW BENDING
SHE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN OF THAT SORT I'D EVER KNOWN
IT IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT HER EYELIDS FELL AND HER LIPS QUIVERED
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING THAT HAD AN ABSOLUTE VALUE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL AND IT WAS JUST THAT ORIGINAL IMPULSE THAT INTERNAL HEAT THAT FEELING OF ONE'S SELF IN ONE'S OWN BREAST
AS TALL AS HIMSELF SOME ONE WHISPERED
THE BOYS HAVE SWEPT THE SNOW OFF THE POND AND ARE SKATING FURIOUSLY
THERE'S A VERY MODISH WOMAN AND HER SMILE IS VERY BLAND IN THE CITY AS THE SUN SINKS LOW
BARTLEY NEVER DINED ALONE IF HE COULD HELP IT AND MAINHALL WAS A GOOD GOSSIP WHO ALWAYS KNEW WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON IN TOWN
AND IT PULSES THROUGH THE PLEASURES OF THE CITY AND THE PAIN THAT SURROUND THE SINGING ORGAN LIKE A LARGE ETERNAL LIGHT AND THEY'VE GIVEN IT A GLORY AND A PART OF PLAY AGAIN IN THE SYMPHONY THAT RULES THE DAY AND NIGHT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY
NOTHING AT ALL
SHE GREW MUCH FONDER OF BARTLEY THAN SHE WAS OF ME
SOMETIMES IT CAME UPON HIM SOFTLY IN ENERVATING REVERIES
WHEN HE RETURNED TO HIS HOTEL HE EXAMINED THE NEW DIRECTORY AND FOUND MISS BURGOYNE'S ADDRESS STILL GIVEN AS OFF BEDFORD SQUARE THOUGH AT A NEW NUMBER
AND I AM SO SORRY BARTLEY IS LATE
BUT THE WONDER WAS THAT HE WAS NOT OUT OF PLACE THERE,--THAT IT ALL SEEMED TO GLOW LIKE THE INEVITABLE BACKGROUND FOR HIS VIGOR AND VEHEMENCE
HILDA SEEMED PARTICULARLY FOND OF THIS QUAINT COUPLE AND BARTLEY HIMSELF WAS SO PLEASED WITH THEIR MILD AND THOUGHTFUL CONVERSE THAT HE TOOK HIS LEAVE WHEN THEY DID AND WALKED WITH THEM OVER TO OXFORD STREET WHERE THEY WAITED FOR THEIR BUS
SOMETHING LIKE THAT YES
AND AFTER THE LIGHT WENT OUT HE WALKED ALONE TAKING THE HEAVENS INTO HIS CONFIDENCE UNABLE TO TEAR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE WHITE MAGIC OF THE NIGHT UNWILLING TO SLEEP BECAUSE LONGING WAS SO SWEET TO HIM AND BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE FIRST THE HILLS WERE HUNG WITH MOONLIGHT THERE WAS A LOVER IN THE WORLD
THIS TIME"--HE SPOKE ALOUD AND THROUGH HIS SET TEETH--"THIS TIME I'M GOING TO END IT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE THIRD DAY OUT ALEXANDER WAS SITTING WELL TO THE STERN ON THE WINDWARD SIDE WHERE THE CHAIRS WERE FEW HIS RUGS OVER HIM AND THE COLLAR OF HIS FUR-LINED COAT TURNED UP ABOUT HIS EARS
SHE HEARD IT IN BOSTON YESTERDAY--HEARD THE NEWSBOYS CRYING IT IN THE STREET AT NOON PHILIP HORTON MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD WITH A TRAY AND A TIN COFFEE-POT FROM THE CAMP KITCHEN
WHEN HILDA HAD DRESSED FOR THE STREET AND CAME OUT OF HER DRESSING-ROOM SHE FOUND HUGH MACCONNELL WAITING FOR HER IN THE CORRIDOR
SHALL EDWARD BRING DOWN YOUR TRUNKS SIR YES
I REMEMBER IT TOUCHED ME SO
BLINKING UP AT THE LIGHTS MAINHALL ADDED IN HIS LUXURIOUS WORLDLY WAY
WHEN HE LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER SHE WAS LACING HER BOOTS
AN INSTANT LATER HIS FACE CLEARED THE WATER
I'LL CUT OFF A DAY IN LIVERPOOL
BUT I WANT YOU TO WEAR THEM
THE NEXT MORNING WAS BRIGHT AND MILD WITH A FRESH BREEZE
THE WIDOWS OF THE LOST WORKMEN MOVING UP AND DOWN THE BANK WITH SHAWLS OVER THEIR HEADS SOME OF THEM CARRYING BABIES LOOKED AT THE RUSTY HIRED HACK MANY TIMES THAT MORNING
BUT PERHAPS AS I'M SO WARM--GIVE ME YOUR HANDKERCHIEF
ALEXANDER'S BIG WORK-TABLE STOOD IN FRONT OF ONE OF THE THREE WINDOWS AND ABOVE THE COUCH HUNG THE ONE PICTURE IN THE ROOM A BIG CANVAS OF CHARMING COLOR AND SPIRIT A STUDY OF THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS IN EARLY SPRING PAINTED IN HIS YOUTH BY A MAN WHO HAD SINCE BECOME A PORTRAIT-PAINTER OF INTERNATIONAL RENOWN
ABOVE ALL HE THOUGHT OF HOW GLORIOUS IT HAD BEEN AND HOW QUICKLY IT HAD PASSED
THAT MEANS THAT I WAS LOOKING VERY SEEDY AT THE END OF THE SEASON DOESN'T IT
THE NEXT AFTERNOON AT THE HOUR WHEN THE RIVER WAS BEGINNING TO REDDEN UNDER THE DECLINING SUN WILSON AGAIN FOUND HIMSELF FACING MRS ALEXANDER AT THE TEA-TABLE IN THE LIBRARY
AFTER TEN YEARS SHE MUST KNOW HIM
CAN'T I GET A SCARF OR SOMETHING ASK A THEATRE LADY IF SHE'S AFRAID OF DRAFTS HILDA LAUGHED
AT THIS MOMENT IT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM EXULTANT AND LIVE AS QUICKSILVER WHISPERING IN JULY YOU WILL BE IN ENGLAND ALREADY HE DREADED THE LONG EMPTY DAYS AT SEA THE MONOTONOUS IRISH COAST THE SLUGGISH PASSAGE UP THE MERSEY THE FLASH OF THE BOAT TRAIN THROUGH THE SUMMER COUNTRY
IT WAS LATE WHEN WILSON REACHED HILDA'S APARTMENT ON THIS PARTICULAR DECEMBER AFTERNOON AND HE FOUND HER ALONE
ALEXANDER SPRANG TO THE PLATFORM AND HURRIED UP THE SIDING WAVING TO PHILIP HORTON ONE OF HIS ASSISTANTS WHO WAS ANXIOUSLY LOOKING UP AT THE WINDOWS OF THE COACHES
IT MUST TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF TIME CERTAINLY AND BARTLEY MUST TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF TIME
HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT
HE WENT BACK TO HIS HOTEL FEELING THAT HE HAD HAD A GOOD EVENING AND HE SLEPT WELL
HE WAS PAYING FOR SUCCESS TOO IN THE DEMANDS MADE ON HIS TIME BY BOARDS OF CIVIC ENTERPRISE AND COMMITTEES OF PUBLIC WELFARE
IT ALWAYS SEEMED AS IF BARTLEY WERE THERE SOMEHOW AND THAT AT ANY MOMENT ONE MIGHT HEAR HIS HEAVY TRAMP ON THE STAIRS
THE RED FOGGY DARKNESS THE HUNGRY CROWDS BEFORE THE THEATRES THE HAND-ORGANS THE FEVERISH RHYTHM OF THE BLURRED CROWDED STREETS AND THE FEELING OF LETTING HIMSELF GO WITH THE CROWD
AND THE MUSIC'S NOT IMMORTAL BUT THE WORLD HAS MADE IT SWEET AND ENRICHED IT WITH THE HARMONIES THAT MAKE A SONG COMPLETE IN THE DEEPER HEAVENS OF MUSIC WHERE THE NIGHT AND MORNING MEET AS IT DIES INTO THE SUNSET GLOW
YOU ARE HAPPY AREN'T YOU WINIFRED
IT'S ALL VERY WELL IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL BUT THESE ESTIMATES HAVE NEVER BEEN USED FOR ANYTHING OF SUCH LENGTH BEFORE
NOW LET'S GO TO SOME AWFULLY JOLLY PLACE FOR DINNER BEFORE WE GO HOME
THIS IS A NASTY SORT OF DAY TO SAIL
I'LL WORK LIKE THE DEVIL WINIFRED AND BE HOME AGAIN BEFORE YOU REALIZE I'VE GONE HE KISSED HER QUICKLY SEVERAL TIMES HURRIED OUT OF THE FRONT DOOR INTO THE RAIN AND WAVED TO HER FROM THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AS THE DRIVER WAS STARTING HIS MELANCHOLY DRIPPING BLACK HORSES
WILSON AND I ARE GROWING VERY DULL
IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONED ME OR ANYTHING
HOW IS IT I ASK MYSELF THAT EVERYTHING CAN BE SO DIFFERENT WITH ME WHEN NOTHING HERE HAS CHANGED
HIS WIFE HELD HIS STICK SMILING
OF COURSE I ALWAYS FELT THAT MY IMAGE OF HIM WAS JUST A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM HERS
HE GLANCED ENTREATINGLY AT THE DOOR AS IF TO CALL HER BACK
HE REMEMBERED THE SHORTEST WAY
YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD I GOT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO
I USED TO GO UP FROM THE WORKS TO HAVE TEA WITH HER AND SIT TALKING TO HER FOR HOURS
A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
SHE CREPT ACROSS TO HIM DRAWING HER STOOL AFTER HER
MRS ALEXANDER SCREENED HER FACE FROM THE FIRELIGHT WHICH WAS BEGINNING TO THROW WAVERING BRIGHT SPOTS ON HER DRESS AND HAIR AS THE DUSK DEEPENED
ONCE THE CHORDS BEGAN TO BUCKLE THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TONS OF IRONWORK ALL RIVETED TOGETHER AND LYING IN MIDAIR WITHOUT SUPPORT
HUGH'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPRESSIBLE
TIME AND SUCCESS HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS TO BOTH OF US
WHAT A WARM SOFT SPRING EVENING THAT WAS HE WENT ON AS THEY SAT DOWN IN THE STUDY WITH THE COFFEE ON A LITTLE TABLE BETWEEN THEM
YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T BELONG
IS THAT WHY YOU THINK IT PRETTY
TAKE THE WHITE ONE TO MR ALEXANDER'S STUDY
ONLY I CAN'T HELP BEING GLAD THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING FOR HIM EVEN IN STUPID AND VULGAR PEOPLE
HIS WIFE WAS THE WOMAN WHO HAD MADE HIS LIFE GRATIFIED HIS PRIDE GIVEN DIRECTION TO HIS TASTES AND HABITS
HE SHUDDERED AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM AT THE POOR UNCONSCIOUS COMPANIONS OF HIS JOURNEY UNKEMPT AND TRAVEL-STAINED NOW DOUBLED IN UNLOVELY ATTITUDES WHO HAD COME TO STAND TO HIM FOR THE UGLINESS HE HAD BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD
FOR A MOMENT IN THE DEPTHS OF THE RIVER HE HAD REALIZED WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO DIE A HYPOCRITE AND TO LIE DEAD UNDER THE LAST ABANDONMENT OF HER TENDERNESS
SHE PROBABLY NEVER THOUGHT OF IT HILDA BIT HER LIP
I WANTED YOU ALWAYS TO BE HAPPY AND HANDSOME AND SUCCESSFUL--TO HAVE ALL THE THINGS THAT A GREAT MAN OUGHT TO HAVE AND ONCE IN A WAY THE CARELESS HOLIDAYS THAT GREAT MEN ARE NOT PERMITTED BARTLEY GAVE A BITTER LITTLE LAUGH AND HILDA LOOKED UP AND READ IN THE DEEPENING LINES OF HIS FACE THAT YOUTH AND BARTLEY WOULD NOT MUCH LONGER STRUGGLE TOGETHER
I TRIED TO GET HIM HERE A DAY EARLIER BUT MY TELEGRAM MISSED HIM SOMEHOW
BUT WHY DO YOU LET ME CHATTER ON LIKE THIS
SHE DEMANDED A GREAT DEAL OF HERSELF AND OF THE PEOPLE SHE LOVED
WHEN SHE LOOKED AT ONE DIRECTLY FOR A MOMENT THEY WERE LIKE A GLIMPSE OF FINE WINDY SKY THAT MAY BRING ALL SORTS OF WEATHER
ALL THE SAME LIFE RUNS SMOOTHLY ENOUGH WITH SOME PEOPLE AND WITH ME IT'S ALWAYS A MESSY SORT OF PATCHWORK
I CAN'T SEE YOU AT ALL ANYWHERE
HE WAS NOT STARTLED
AND THE SKY OVER THE BRIDGES WAS JUST THE COLOR OF THE LILACS
HE SELDOM MOVED EXCEPT TO BRUSH THEM AWAY
SOMETIMES TO SET OUT FOR GAY ADVENTURES AT TWICKENHAM OR RICHMOND SOMETIMES TO LINGER ABOUT THE PLACE FOR A WHILE AND TO PONDER BY LORD ELGIN'S MARBLES UPON THE LASTINGNESS OF SOME THINGS OR IN THE MUMMY ROOM UPON THE AWFUL BREVITY OF OTHERS
I SHALL CERTAINLY SEE HIM IN NEW YORK
HE'S THAT GIFTED YOU KNOW BUT HE WILL DRINK AND LOSES MORE GOOD ENGAGEMENTS THAN OTHER FELLOWS EVER GET
AND NOW HER GRIEF IS LIKE THAT
NOT HARD TO ME WINIFRED HE WHISPERED
TWO PEOPLE WHEN THEY LOVE EACH OTHER GROW ALIKE IN THEIR TASTES AND HABITS AND PRIDE BUT THEIR MORAL NATURES WHATEVER WE MAY MEAN BY THAT CANTING EXPRESSION ARE NEVER WELDED
I AM WORKING ON THE SCHUMANN `CARNIVAL AND THOUGH I DON'T PRACTICE A GREAT MANY HOURS I AM VERY METHODICAL MRS ALEXANDER EXPLAINED AS SHE CROSSED TO AN UPRIGHT PIANO THAT STOOD AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM NEAR THE WINDOWS
IT WAS ON THE QUAI WE MET THAT WOMAN WHO WAS CRYING SO BITTERLY
ALEXANDER SAT UP AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM
IT'S ONLY LATELY SINCE MACCONNELL AND HIS SET HAVE GOT HOLD OF HER THAT SHE'S COME UP
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING MAINHALL LOUNGED A LITTLE NEARER AND DROPPED INTO A TONE EVEN MORE CONSPICUOUSLY CONFIDENTIAL
I HOPE HE DIDN'T STOP HIM TOO SOON
MAKES THE WHOLE THING A FAIRY TALE THE SECOND ACT OPENED BEFORE PHILLY DOYLE'S UNDERGROUND STILL WITH PEGGY AND HER BATTERED DONKEY COME IN TO SMUGGLE A LOAD OF POTHEEN ACROSS THE BOG AND TO BRING PHILLY WORD OF WHAT WAS DOING IN THE WORLD WITHOUT AND OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING ALONG THE ROADSIDES AND DITCHES WITH THE FIRST GLEAM OF FINE WEATHER
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE RARE AFTERNOONS WHEN ALL THE THICKNESS AND SHADOW OF LONDON ARE CHANGED TO A KIND OF SHINING PULSING SPECIAL ATMOSPHERE
HOWEVER WE REALLY SPEND MORE TIME THERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE HOUSE
OF COURSE AS TIME GOES ON TO HER HE BECOMES MORE AND MORE THEIR SIMPLE PERSONAL RELATION HILDA STUDIED THE DROOP OF THE PROFESSOR'S HEAD INTENTLY
AND THAT'S SAYING A GOOD DEAL WELL HE IS STILL CLEVER AND LAZY
SHE WAS APPARENTLY TELLING THEM A STORY
I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON
WHAT DID IT MEAN--WHAT WAS THE ANSWER
NOW WE'LL GO OUT AND CALL THE MEN OFF QUIETLY
SHE WALKED QUIETLY WITHOUT ONCE BREAKING OR STUMBLING
SINCE WHEN HAVE YOU BEEN INTERESTED IN BRIDGES
SO SHE WAS STILL IN THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR BEDFORD SQUARE
BY THE NEXT MORNING FORTY-EIGHT BODIES HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE RIVER BUT THERE WERE STILL TWENTY MISSING
BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY
YOU AND I HILDA TOOK A QUICK SOFT BREATH
OFF TO THE LEFT UNDER THE APPROACH OF A WEATHER-STAINED WOODEN BRIDGE A GROUP OF BOYS WERE SITTING AROUND A LITTLE FIRE
WHEN HE REACHED THE CARRIAGE HE FOUND MRS ALEXANDER JUST AS HE HAD LEFT HER IN THE EARLY MORNING LEANING FORWARD A LITTLE WITH HER HAND ON THE LOWERED WINDOW LOOKING AT THE RIVER
HE FELT RICH TO-NIGHT IN THE POSSESSION OF THAT UNSTULTIFIED SURVIVAL
WHY DID YOU REMIND ME OF THE MUMMY
SHE HAD KNOWN GORDON AND LIVINGSTONE AND BEACONSFIELD WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG,--EVERY ONE
THAT THIS HE GROANED THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME ON NEW YEAR'S DAY A THAW SET IN AND DURING THE NIGHT TORRENTS OF RAIN FELL
SHE CARRIED HER HEAD TOO A LITTLE MORE RESOLUTELY
PEOPLE OFTEN MAKE THAT MISTAKE NO I'M SERIOUS ALEXANDER
THE COMING MEN ARE ALWAYS LIKE THAT
IT'S LIKE THAT WITH US LONDONERS TOO HILDA WAS SAYING
DEAR ME MAC THE GIRL COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE BETTER YOU KNOW MACCONNELL GRUNTED
IT REALLY HURTS MY FEELINGS
AN AMERICAN STUDENT WHOM SHE MET IN PARIS I BELIEVE
YES YOU ARE A PLUCKY ONE HILDA SIGHED
HAPPY PEOPLE DO A GREAT DEAL FOR THEIR FRIENDS
YOU'VE GOT AWFULLY NICE FRIENDS HE ADDED HUMBLY PICKING UP A LITTLE JADE ELEPHANT FROM HER DESK
HE WASN'T A REMARKABLE STUDENT YOU KNOW THOUGH HE WAS ALWAYS STRONG IN HIGHER MATHEMATICS
ISN'T LONDON A TOMB ON SUNDAY NIGHT ALEXANDER CAUGHT THE AGITATION IN HER VOICE
SHE GOT TIRED OF COOKING AND SCOURING THE COPPERS IN MADAME ANGER'S LITTLE KITCHEN SO SHE RAN AWAY WITH A SOLDIER AND THEN WITH ANOTHER SOLDIER
SHE WAS CLEARLY VERY PROUD OF HIS GOOD LOOKS AND HIS FINE COLOR
WHATEVER TOOK ITS PLACE ACTION REFLECTION THE POWER OF CONCENTRATED THOUGHT WERE ONLY FUNCTIONS OF A MECHANISM USEFUL TO SOCIETY
SHE STEPPED OUT QUICKLY AND LIGHTLY
SHE WAS AFRAID TO LOOK UP AT HIM
I'VE NO NEED FOR FINE CLOTHES IN MAC'S PLAY THIS TIME SO I CAN AFFORD A FEW DUDDIES FOR MYSELF
IT WAS A WARM SMOKY EVENING AND THERE WAS A GRIMY MOON
EPILOGUE PROFESSOR WILSON HAD BEEN LIVING IN LONDON FOR SIX YEARS AND HE WAS JUST BACK FROM A VISIT TO AMERICA
COME DON'T BE ANGRY BUT DON'T TRY TO POSE FOR ME OR TO BE ANYTHING BUT WHAT YOU ARE
WHAT IS IT BARTLEY BENT LOWER OVER THE FIRE
BARTLEY WAS TELLING ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR AUNT LAST NIGHT
IT WAS A SPECTACULAR UNDERTAKING BY REASON OF ITS VERY SIZE AND BARTLEY REALIZED THAT WHATEVER ELSE HE MIGHT DO HE WOULD PROBABLY ALWAYS BE KNOWN AS THE ENGINEER WHO DESIGNED THE GREAT MOORLOCK BRIDGE THE LONGEST CANTILEVER IN EXISTENCE
DON'T DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT RASHLY HIS FACE GREW TROUBLED
HE HAD FIRST NOTICED HER ABOUT THE CORRIDORS OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM WHERE HE READ CONSTANTLY
ONE SUNDAY EVENING AT LADY WALFORD'S ALEXANDER DID AT LAST MEET HILDA BURGOYNE
AND SOME NEVER GET A FAIR WIND
OUT OF SO MANY CONQUESTS AND THE SPOILS OF CONQUERED CITIES
DEAR OLD MADAME ANGER IS DEAD--BUT PERHAPS YOU DON'T REMEMBER HER DON'T I THOUGH
HE EVEN LEANED FORWARD OVER THE RAIL A LITTLE
FOR ALEXANDER DEATH WAS AN EASY CREDITOR
CAN'T YOU SEE BARTLEY THAT I'M TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
AT LEAST TELL ME THAT YOU BELIEVE I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING YOU HAPPY HIS HAND SHUT DOWN QUICKLY OVER THE QUESTIONING FINGERS ON HIS SLEEVES
I WAS SAVING THEM
MANY OF THE MEN HAD FALLEN WITH THE BRIDGE AND WERE HELD DOWN UNDER THE DEBRIS
THE MOORLOCK BRIDGE LAY THREE MILES ABOVE THE TOWN
WE OPEN IN FEBRUARY YOU KNOW WELL THEN YOU'VE WORKED ENOUGH
`THE MEMORY OF MRS BARTLEY WILL MAKE MY WHOLE WINTER FRAGRANT JUST LIKE HIM
THERE JUST IN FRONT HE SLIPPED THE CORNERS CAREFULLY UNDER HER SHOULDER-STRAPS
HE HESITATED A MOMENT BEFORE MOUNTING THE STEPS
UNTIL SHE SPOKE BARTLEY HAD NOT REALIZED THAT HE WAS IN LOVE
YOU HAVE HAD A LONG JOURNEY HAVEN'T YOU MRS ALEXANDER ASKED AFTER SHOWING GRACIOUS CONCERN ABOUT HIS TEA
SUNDAY WAS A COLD RAW DAY AND A FINE RAIN FELL CONTINUOUSLY
EXCEPT FOR AN OLD FARMER JOGGING ALONG THE HIGHROAD IN HIS BOX-WAGON THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER LIVING CREATURE TO BE SEEN
ON THE WHITE VELVET LAY TWO LONG PENDANTS OF CURIOUSLY WORKED GOLD SET WITH PEARLS
BUT COLDER
SOME GET A BAD HURT EARLY AND LOSE THEIR COURAGE
HILDA LAUGHED AND WENT OVER TO THE PIANO
I BELIEVE SHE USED TO REMEMBER HILDA SAID THOUGHTFULLY
AND HOWEVER ONE TOOK HIM HOWEVER MUCH ONE ADMIRED HIM ONE HAD TO ADMIT THAT HE SIMPLY WOULDN'T SQUARE
AND HAVE I DONE ANYTHING SO FOOL AS THAT NOW HE ASKED
WE MUST HAVE HIM TO DINNER MY DEAR AND WE DID
SIR HARRY TOWNE MR BARTLEY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEER SIR HARRY TOWNE BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MR ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKYO
I'M LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE--MORE AGREEABLE TO MEET WHEN THINGS ARE GOING WELL WITH ME
OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD-FASHIONED GILT MIRROR
AND IN ALL THE GAUDY BUSSES THERE ARE SCORES OF WEARY FEET MARKING TIME SWEET TIME WITH A DULL MECHANIC BEAT AND A THOUSAND HEARTS ARE PLUNGING TO A LOVE THEY'LL NEVER MEET THROUGH THE MEADOWS OF THE SUNSET THROUGH THE POPPIES AND THE WHEAT IN THE LAND WHERE THE DEAD DREAMS GO
SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOO
HE WOULD LOSE THE THING HE VALUED MOST IN THE WORLD
ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST THINGS ABOUT SUCCESS IS THAT IT MAKES PEOPLE WANT TO LOOK ONE UP IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN
REALLY FOR ME THIS TIME
TOWARD SIX O'CLOCK THE WIND ROSE AND TUGGED AT THE TARPAULIN AND BROUGHT THE SWELL HIGHER
I'M TELLING YOU WHAT I'VE MADE UP MY MIND TO DO
OH I SHOULD THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SAFE PREDICTION
IT LOOKS VERY SPLENDID THERE BUT I FEEL PIGGISH TO HAVE IT
WHEN ALEXANDER AWOKE IN THE MORNING THE SUN WAS JUST RISING THROUGH PALE GOLDEN RIPPLES OF CLOUD AND THE FRESH YELLOW LIGHT WAS VIBRATING THROUGH THE PINE WOODS
WITH HER OWN HANDS SHE WASHED HIM CLEAN OF EVERY MARK OF DISASTER
SO IT'S JEREMIAH JEREMIAH WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY WHEN YOU MEET THE GARLAND GIRLS TRIPPING ON THEIR WAY
THE SIGHT OF YOU BARTLEY TO SEE YOU LIVING AND HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL--CAN I NEVER MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME SHE PRESSED HIS SHOULDERS GENTLY
THE MUMMY ROOM OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM HAD BEEN ONE OF THE CHIEF DELIGHTS OF HER CHILDHOOD
SARAH FROST THE NOVELIST CAME WITH HER HUSBAND A VERY GENIAL AND PLACID OLD SCHOLAR WHO HAD BECOME SLIGHTLY DERANGED UPON THE SUBJECT OF THE FOURTH DIMENSION
I'VE JUMPED UP IF THE FIRE CRACKLED
I CAN'T EVEN LET YOU GO HOME AGAIN
YOU'D HAVE GOT IT QUICK ENOUGH WELL REALLY MR ALEXANDER I COULDN'T BE ABSOLUTELY SURE YOU KNOW AND I DIDN'T LIKE TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MAKING IT PUBLIC ALEXANDER PUSHED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE
LORD WESTMERE STROKED HIS LONG WHITE MUSTACHE WITH HIS BLOODLESS HAND AND LOOKED AT ALEXANDER BLANKLY
I TOLD THE COMMISSION THAT WE WERE USING HIGHER UNIT STRESSES THAN ANY PRACTICE HAS ESTABLISHED AND WE'VE PUT THE DEAD LOAD AT A LOW ESTIMATE
THE BASE ONE GOES ON BEING BASE AND THE NOBLE ONE NOBLE TO THE END
MAC IS WRITING ONE
IN THE DAYS WHEN ALEXANDER KNEW HER HILDA ALWAYS MANAGED TO HAVE A LODGING OF SOME SORT ABOUT BEDFORD SQUARE BECAUSE SHE CLUNG TENACIOUSLY TO SUCH SCRAPS AND SHREDS OF MEMORIES AS WERE CONNECTED WITH IT
I WAS JUST THINKING THERE MIGHT BE PEOPLE OVER THERE YOU'D BE GLAD TO SEE HE BROUGHT OUT AWKWARDLY
SOMETIMES HE ROSE SUDDENLY FROM HIS CHAIR AS IF DRIVEN OUT AND PACED THE DECK FOR HOURS
IN THE POCKET OF HIS COAT WINIFRED FOUND THE LETTER THAT HE HAD WRITTEN HER THE NIGHT BEFORE HE LEFT NEW YORK WATER-SOAKED AND ILLEGIBLE BUT BECAUSE OF ITS LENGTH SHE KNEW IT HAD BEEN MEANT FOR HER
WE COME ACROSS OTHER PLEASING AND ENDEARING QUALITIES SO MUCH OFTENER THAN WE FIND FORCE AND AFTER ALL SAID MRS ALEXANDER THAT IS THE THING WE ALL LIVE UPON
I EXPECT THE FACT IS THAT WE NONE OF US KNEW HIM VERY WELL MRS ALEXANDER
OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OWE ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION
BUT HILDA BURGOYNE'S THE HIT OF THE PIECE
EVERY ONE HAD HEARD OF THE NEW CANTILEVER BRIDGE IN CANADA
SHE LOOKED ABOUT DESPERATELY FROM BARTLEY TO THE DOOR THEN TO THE WINDOWS AND BACK AGAIN TO BARTLEY
AND NOW I SCARCELY KNOW MYSELF HERE
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THAT THERE ARE BIRDS IN THE BUSHES BARTLEY STOPPED AND SAT FROWNING INTO THE FIRE HIS SHOULDERS THRUST FORWARD AS IF HE WERE ABOUT TO SPRING AT SOMETHING
THE PLACES WHERE HE DIDN'T SQUARE HILDA CONSIDERED VAGUELY
TO GROW STRONG
ON THE INSTANT HE FELT THAT MARVELOUS RETURN OF THE IMPETUOUSNESS THE INTENSE EXCITEMENT THE INCREASING EXPECTANCY OF YOUTH
IF HE'D GOT HERE MONDAY HE'D HAVE HAD ALL THE MEN OFF AT ONCE
COLD FOR EVERYTHING BUT HIM
SEVERAL YEARS AGO I READ SUCH A LOT IN THE PAPERS ABOUT THE WONDERFUL THINGS YOU DID IN JAPAN AND HOW THE EMPEROR DECORATED YOU
HE FELT GUILTY AND UNHAPPY ABOUT HER FOR A TIME BUT AFTER WINIFRED PROMISED TO MARRY HIM HE REALLY FORGOT HILDA ALTOGETHER
URGENT
THE SLENDER TOWERS WERE WASHED BY A RAIN OF GOLDEN LIGHT AND LICKED BY LITTLE FLICKERING FLAMES
THEY GO ONLY WITH FACES LIKE YOURS--VERY VERY PROUD AND JUST A LITTLE HARD WINIFRED LAUGHED AS SHE WENT OVER TO THE MIRROR AND FITTED THE DELICATE SPRINGS TO THE LOBES OF HER EARS
INDEED IT WAS TO SEE HER THAT I LINGERED ON AND ON
BUT I DID IT THOROUGHLY
ALEXANDER STOOPED TO STROKE HER AND THEN PLUNGED INTO HIS COAT AND DREW ON HIS GLOVES
HE PLAYED BRIDGE UNTIL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND MANAGED TO LOSE A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY WITHOUT REALLY NOTICING THAT HE WAS DOING SO
SHE LIKED MEN OF ACTION AND DISLIKED YOUNG MEN WHO WERE CAREFUL OF THEMSELVES AND WHO AS SHE PUT IT WERE ALWAYS TRIMMING THEIR WICK AS IF THEY WERE AFRAID OF THEIR OIL'S GIVING OUT
HAVE YOU HAD YOURS
THEY STOOD IN LONG BLACK LINES WAITING BEFORE THE PIT ENTRANCES OF THE THEATRES--SHORT-COATED BOYS AND GIRLS IN SAILOR HATS ALL SHIVERING AND CHATTING GAYLY
THE END RIVETERS HAD REACHED THE BANK AND WERE DISPERSING AMONG THE TOOL-HOUSES AND THE SECOND GANG HAD PICKED UP THEIR TOOLS AND WERE STARTING TOWARD THE SHORE
ARE YOU JOKING HILDA INDEED I'M NOT THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YES I KNOW VERY WELL
THAT SOUNDS LIKE `THE MIKADO AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR NEW BRIDGE--IN CANADA ISN'T IT AND IT'S TO BE THE LONGEST ONE IN THE WORLD AND HAS SOME QUEER NAME I CAN'T REMEMBER BARTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SMILED DROLLY
WILSON COULD NOT IMAGINE HER PERMITTING HERSELF TO DO ANYTHING BADLY BUT HE WAS SURPRISED AT THE CLEANNESS OF HER EXECUTION
OH SO-SO
THE WATER WAS ROUGHISH A COLD CLEAR INDIGO BREAKING INTO WHITECAPS
I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY
EVERYTHING SEEMED PERFECTLY NATURAL
WELL WE MUST SHOW WEAR AT LAST YOU KNOW WILSON TOOK THE CUP GRATEFULLY
HIS WIFE BENT OVER HIM
HE STARTED BACK AND TORE HIS COAT OPEN AS IF SOMETHING WARM WERE ACTUALLY CLINGING TO HIM BENEATH IT
HE WAS SIMPLY THE MOST TREMENDOUS RESPONSE TO STIMULI I HAVE EVER KNOWN
I STILL WANT A GOOD MANY HE SAID RATHER GLOOMILY
YOU KNOW I'M SAILING THE DAY AFTER NEW YEAR'S AGAIN
THOMAS BROUGHT HIM HIS HAT AND STICK AND ULSTER
AFTER MILES OF OUTLYING STREETS AND LITTLE GLOOMY HOUSES THEY REACHED LONDON ITSELF RED AND ROARING AND MURKY WITH A THICK DAMPNESS COMING UP FROM THE RIVER THAT BETOKENED FOG AGAIN TO-MORROW
IT BUILDS THE BRIDGES INTO THE FUTURE OVER WHICH THE FEET OF EVERY ONE OF US WILL GO HOW INTERESTED I AM TO HEAR YOU PUT IT IN THAT WAY
THAT'S WHAT YOU FEEL
AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF PHILLY'S BURROW WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PRIMROSES FOR HER DONKEY
AN HOUR LATER HE SENT FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT
HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING MAGNIFICENTLY
I HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN--I WAS BACK THERE
THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED HE DROPPED UPON THE STOOL IN FRONT OF HER AND SAT WITH HIS HANDS HANGING BETWEEN HIS KNEES
BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN ALEXANDER STARTED UP AND BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
WHY DIDN'T YOU LET ME BE ANGRY WITH YOU
IT ALWAYS STIRS ME UP A LITTLE HE PUSHED THE TOP OF THE GLOVE UP SLOWLY
BARTLEY"--HE DROPPED HIS CHIN ON THE BACK OF HIS LONG HAND AND LOOKED AT HER ADMIRINGLY--"BARTLEY CAUGHT THE WIND EARLY AND IT HAS SUNG IN HIS SAILS EVER SINCE MRS ALEXANDER SAT LOOKING INTO THE FIRE WITH INTENT PREOCCUPATION AND WILSON STUDIED HER HALF-AVERTED FACE
WHAT KIND OF A PART IS IT
BARTLEY CAUGHT UP HIS BAG AND HURRIED THROUGH THE PULLMAN COACHES UNTIL HE FOUND THE CONDUCTOR
CHAPTER IV ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON ALEXANDER REMEMBERED MISS BURGOYNE'S INVITATION AND CALLED AT HER APARTMENT
I WAS DETAINED AT A CONCERT AND BARTLEY TELEPHONED THAT HE WOULD BE LATE
THE NEPHEW OF ONE OF THE STANDARD VICTORIAN NOVELISTS MAINHALL BOBBED ABOUT AMONG THE VARIOUS LITERARY CLIQUES OF LONDON AND ITS OUTLYING SUBURBS CAREFUL TO LOSE TOUCH WITH NONE OF THEM
I WANTED YOU TO EAT ALL THE CAKES AND HAVE THEM TOO
AND THERE HE HAD KISSED HER FOR THE FIRST TIME
THOSE WARM CONSONANCES OF COLOR HAD BEEN BLENDING AND MELLOWING BEFORE HE WAS BORN
THERE WAS SOMETHING HE WANTED TO TELL HIS WIFE BUT HE COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY FOR THE ROARING IN HIS EARS
THE ONLY MOMENT THAT EVER WAS OR WILL BE IN THE WORLD THE DOOR FROM THE HALL OPENED A VOICE CALLED WINIFRED HURRIEDLY AND A BIG MAN CAME THROUGH THE DRAWING-ROOM WITH A QUICK HEAVY TREAD BRINGING WITH HIM A SMELL OF CIGAR SMOKE AND CHILL OUT-OF-DOORS AIR
WHAT HE ASKED HIMSELF DID HE WANT WITH THESE GENIAL HONORS AND SUBSTANTIAL COMFORTS
I FOUND THAT I STILL LOVED TO GO TO THE HOUSE
I FEEL ALWAYS ON THE EDGE OF DANGER AND CHANGE
DON'T TRY TO WEAR A CLOAK OF HUMILITY
HAVE I SAID SOMETHING AWKWARD
BUT HE HAD GONE TOO FAR TO LOOK UP WITHOUT TURNING ROUND
THERE IS A GARDEN OUT THERE WITH STARS OVERHEAD WHERE I USED TO WALK AT NIGHT WHEN I HAD A SINGLE PURPOSE AND A SINGLE HEART
IT WOULDN'T REALLY HELP YOU OUT AT ALL MRS ALEXANDER SPOKE SOOTHINGLY
HE IGNORED HER QUESTION
NO RELATION IS SO COMPLETE THAT IT CAN HOLD ABSOLUTELY ALL OF A PERSON
WILSON NOTED HER DRESS TOO,--FOR IN HIS WAY HE HAD AN EYE FOR SUCH THINGS,--PARTICULARLY HER BROWN FURS AND HER HAT
HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF HILDA BURGOYNE FOR YEARS
AND YOU'D COME BACK LATE FOR ALL YOUR ENGAGEMENTS BARTLEY BEGAN JINGLING SOME LOOSE COINS IN HIS POCKET
THAT'S MRS ALEXANDER
SHE WAS TALL CARRIED HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD PROUDLY AND MOVED WITH EASE AND CERTAINTY
IT'S ALL VERY WELL ON PAPER BUT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER IT CAN BE DONE IN PRACTICE
IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE AS HE LOOKED BACK OVER IT THAT THE WHOLE GREAT SPAN WAS INCURABLY DISABLED WAS ALREADY AS GOOD AS CONDEMNED BECAUSE SOMETHING WAS OUT OF LINE IN THE LOWER CHORD OF THE CANTILEVER ARM
VERDI VERDI WHEN YOU WROTE IL TROVATORE DID YOU DREAM OF THE CITY WHEN THE SUN SINKS LOW OF THE ORGAN AND THE MONKEY AND THE MANY-COLORED STREAM ON THE PICCADILLY PAVEMENT OF THE MYRIAD EYES THAT SEEM TO BE LITTEN FOR A MOMENT WITH A WILD ITALIAN GLEAM AS A CHE LA MORTE PARODIES THE WORLD'S ETERNAL THEME AND PULSES WITH THE SUNSET GLOW
THAT MORNING A TELEGRAM FROM MOORLOCK HAD REACHED HIM TELLING HIM THAT THERE WAS SERIOUS TROUBLE WITH THE BRIDGE AND THAT HE WAS NEEDED THERE AT ONCE SO HE HAD CAUGHT THE FIRST TRAIN OUT OF NEW YORK
THERE SIT DOWN AT THE DESK
HE LEANED FORWARD HIS HANDS BETWEEN HIS KNEES SCARCELY BREATHING AS IF HE WERE HOLDING HIMSELF AWAY FROM HIS SURROUNDINGS FROM THE ROOM AND FROM THE VERY CHAIR IN WHICH HE SAT FROM EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE WILD EDDIES OF SNOW ABOVE THE RIVER ON WHICH HIS EYES WERE FIXED WITH FEVERISH INTENTNESS AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO PROJECT HIMSELF THITHER
DON'T LOOK SO CHOPFALLEN DAN
LOOKS AS IF I WERE NOT USED TO WORK DOESN'T IT ALEXANDER LAUGHED AND DROPPED INTO A CHAIR
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE BUT WHY NOW SHE ASKED PITEOUSLY WRINGING HER HANDS
I WOULDN'T BE SO MUCH ALARMED IF I DIDN'T KNOW HOW UTTERLY RECKLESS YOU CAN BE
JUST SOMETHING BARTLEY
NEVER NEVER HARD TO ME LEFT ALONE HE PACED UP AND DOWN HIS STUDY
THE FEW PASSERS-BY GLANCED AT HIM UNCONCERNEDLY AND EVEN THE CHILDREN WHO HURRIED ALONG WITH THEIR SCHOOL-BAGS UNDER THEIR ARMS SEEMED TO FIND IT PERFECTLY NATURAL THAT A TALL BROWN GENTLEMAN SHOULD BE STANDING THERE LOOKING UP THROUGH HIS GLASSES AT THE GRAY HOUSETOPS
MOONING
I'M AFRAID OF MYSELF
YOU WANT TO TELL ME THAT YOU CAN ONLY SEE ME LIKE THIS AS OLD FRIENDS DO OR OUT IN THE WORLD AMONG PEOPLE
