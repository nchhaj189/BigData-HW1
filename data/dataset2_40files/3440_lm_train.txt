HOWEVER AFTER A WHILE I COMFORTED MYSELF SAYING HAPLY I SHALL PREDECEASE HER OR SHALL HAVE RETURNED TO MY OWN LAND BEFORE SHE DIE FOR NONE KNOWETH WHICH SHALL GO FIRST AND WHICH SHALL GO LAST THEN I APPLIED MYSELF TO DIVERTING MY MIND FROM THIS THOUGHT WITH VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS
SOME SAID HE'S DEAD
HE HAD TWO GREAT WINGS AND FOUR ARMS TWO OF THEM LIKE THE ARMS OF THE SONS OF ADAM AND OTHER TWO AS THEY WERE LION'S PAWS WITH CLAWS OF IRON AND HE WAS BLACK AND TALL AND FRIGHTFUL OF ASPECT WITH HAIR LIKE HORSES TAILS AND EYES LIKE BLAZING COALS SLIT UPRIGHT IN HIS FACE
AND PEACE BE WITH THEE THEN THE KING LAVISHED UPON ME MUCH WEALTH AND ENTREATED ME WITH ALL HONOUR
THEN GOING TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP I AGREED WITH HIM FOR MY PASSAGE AND EMBARKED MY COCOA-NUTS AND WHAT ELSE I POSSESSED
BUT THE KING ANSWERED SAYING O MY SON AS REGARDS MY DAUGHTER AL-DATMA I HAVE NO POWER OVER HER FOR SHE HATH SWORN BY HER SOUL TO MARRY NONE EXCEPT HE OVERCOME HER IN THE LISTED FIELD QUOTH THE PRINCE I JOURNEYED HITHER FROM MY FATHER'S COURT WITH NO OTHER OBJECT BUT THIS
WHERE BE THE KINGS OF AL-SíN AND THE LORDS OF MAJESTIC MIEN
WHEN THE KING'S WAZIR SAW THE SADDLE HE ASKED OF ME ONE LIKE IT AND I MADE IT FOR HIM
YET NEVER SAW I HERE ANY LIVING THING SAVE WILD BEASTS AND BIRDS I REPEATED TO HIM THE STORY I HAD TOLD THE SAILORS,[FN#54 BUT ACQUAINTED HIM WITH NOTHING OF THAT WHICH HAD BEFALLEN ME IN THE CITY AND THE CAVERN LEST THERE SHOULD BE ANY OF THE ISLANDRY IN THE SHIP
THE FABLIAU OF LA VIEILLE QUI SEDUISIT LA JEUNE FILLE
SO THEY REPLIED THOU ART OUR KING AND THE SON OF OUR KING AND KISSED GROUND BEFORE HIM
THOU ART WORTHY OF HIM AND HE IS WORTHY OF THEE SO THE DAMSEL SAT DOWN SHAME-FAST AND IN GREAT CONFUSION
THEREUPON ALL HIS HOST RAN AT GHARIB AS ONE MAN AND HE RAN AT THEM CRYING GOD IS MOST GREAT
IF HE WISH FOR WARFARE I'LL SHOW HIM FIGHT AND OUT OF HIS BODY I'LL TEAR HIS SPRITE WHEN THE KING HEARD MY BOASTFUL REPLY HE HARDENED HIS HEART AND RESOLVED TO WAGE WAR UPON THE PROPHET AND TO OFFER HIM BATTLE
WHEN I SAW THAT DESTRUCTION HAD ENTERED OUR DWELLINGS AND HAD HOMED WITH US AND IN THE SEA OF DEATHS HAD DROWNED US I SUMMONED A WRITER AND BADE HIM INDITE THESE VERSES AND INSTANCES AND ADMONITIONS THE WHICH I LET GRAVE WITH RULE AND COMPASS ON THESE DOORS AND TABLETS AND TOMBS

THERE IS NO MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN HIM THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
THEN SAYING AN I BE SAVED TIS OF GOD'S GRACE I EMBARKED THEREON AND COMMITTED MYSELF TO THE CURRENT AND IT BORE ME ON FOR THE FIRST DAY AND THE SECOND AND THE THIRD AFTER LEAVING THE ISLAND
AFTER WHICH THE PRINCE WENT IN UNTO HIS BRIDE AND ABODE WITH HER TWO MONTHS THEN DEPARTED WITH HER FOR HIS FATHER'S CAPITAL
THEY ARE SUPPOSED BY MOSLEMS TO DESCEND FROM THE OLD SYRIANS EXPELLED BY JOSHUA

NOW HE HAD FORTY WAZIRS WHEREOF THE OLDEST WISEST AND CHIEFEST WAS HIGHS DAYDáN
FOR I WILL GO FORTH TO MY FATHER AND WILL TELL HIM AND HE SHALL KILL THEE SO SIGNING HE AROSE IN RAGE AND WENT OUT FROM HER CHAMBER

FN#135 THESE WERE THE BRIDES OF THE TREASURE ALLUDED TO IN THE STORY OF HASAN OF BASSORAH AND ELSEWHERE
BUT ALMIGHTY ALLAH SUCCOURED HIM
FOR AT THE END OF THAT TIME SáLIM SAID TO SALíM O MY BROTHER HOW LONG IS THIS STATE TO LAST
WHEN THE MOTHER SAW THIS SHE SAID TO HER DAUGHTER TELL ME WHAT HATH PASSED BETWEEN THEE AND THY HUSBAND TO BRING ABOUT THIS BUT SHE SWORE TO HER THAT SHE KNEW NOT THE CAUSE THEREOF AND THAT THERE HAD BEFALLEN NOTHING BETWEEN THEM TO CALL FOR THIS CONDUCT
PRESENTLY I LANDED TO SOLACE MYSELF IN THE CITY BUT MEANWHILE THE SHIP SET SAIL WITHOUT ME AND I REPENTED OF HAVING GONE ASHORE AND CALLING TO MIND MY COMPANIONS AND WHAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WITH THE APES FIRST AND AFTER SAT DOWN AND FELL A WEEPING AND LAMENTING
AND THUS I ABODE A LONG WHILE TILL ONE DAY I CAME WITH HIM TO A PLACE WHEREIN WAS ABUNDANCE OF GOURDS MANY OF THEM DRY
FOR IF THOU HADST MADE HER TAKE OFF HER PETTICOAT TROUSERS WE HAD WON TO OUR WISH
HOW MANY A HOST THEY LED AND LAID ON LOAD

NOW THE HUSBAND HAD A YOUNG MAN WHOM HE HAD BROUGHT UP IN HIS HOUSE AND WHO WAS IN HIGH TRUST WITH HIM AS HIS STEWARD
SO WHATEVER THOU HAST A MIND TO OF THE WANTS OF THIS WORLD RUB THIS RING AND ITS SERVANT WILL APPEAR AND DO ALL THOU BIDDEST HIM THEN HE RUBBED THE RING BEFORE HIM WHEREUPON THE JINNI APPEARED SAYING ADSUM O MY LORD

WHITE ROBES DENOTED PEACE AND MERCY AS WELL AS JOY
AND INDEED MANIFEST UPON HIM WERE THE SIGNS OF AFFECTION AND DISTRACTION
AND THEN THREW THE LETTER DOWN TO HIM FROM ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE PAVILION
THEIR SKINS QUAKED THEIR COLOUR CHANGED THEIR HEARTS DIED WITHIN THEM AND THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER WHOSO GOETH OUT AGAINST THIS GHUL HE EATETH HIM AND CRACKETH HIS BONES AND CAUSETH HIM TO LACK THE ZEPHYR-WIND OF THE WORLD WHEREFORE THEY HELD THEIR HANDS QUAILING FOR FEAR OF THE GHUL AND HIS SONS AND TURNED TO FLY MAKING FOR THE TOWN
BEWARE THEN OF HIS ASSAULT AND MAKE READY FOR HIS ONSLAUGHT
THOU ART FREED FOR THE ALMIGHTY'S SAKE AND BEFORE HIS FACE
THEN I WENT UP TO THE CAPTAIN AND ASKED HIM O MY LORD KNOWEST THOU WHAT MANNER OF MAN WAS THIS SINDBAD WHOSE GOODS THOU HAST COMMITTED TO ME FOR SALE
THEN DO THOU DEMAND IT BACK FROM HIM THE WAZIR ANSWERED WITH LOVE AND GLADNESS SO THE PRINCE RETURNED TO HIS PALACE AND FIXING THE PADLOCK THE KEY WHEREOF HE HAD GIVEN THE LADY ON A CHEST HE HAD BY HIM ENTERED THEREIN
AFTER AWHILE HIS MASTER THE MERCHANT SET OUT ON A PILGRIMAGE TO MECCAH TAKING JUDAR WITH HIM AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE CITY THE CAIRENE REPAIRED TO THE HARAM TEMPLE TO CIRCUMAMBULATE THE KA'ABAH
WHAT WHILE I LIVED HAPPY WITH A TEMPER HAUGHT AND HIGH MY HOARDING-PLACE DEFENDING LIKE A LION IN THE FIGHT I TOOK NO REST AND GREED OF GAIN FORBAD ME GIVE A GRAIN OF MUSTARD SEED TO SAVE FROM THE FIRES OF HELL MY SPRITE UNTIL STRICKEN ON A DAY AS WITH ARROW BY DECREE OF THE MAKER THE FASHIONER THE LORD OF MIGHT AND RIGHT
SO HE ASSEMBLED A COMPANY OF HIS KINSFOLK TOGETHER WITH DIVERS MEN OF LEARNING AND PROPERTY DISTRIBUTORS OF THE KAZI'S COURT AND BIDDING BRING ALL HIS MONIES AND CLOTH SAID TO THEM O FOLK DIVIDE YE THIS MONEY AND STUFF INTO FOUR PORTIONS ACCORDING TO THE LAW THEY DID SO AND HE GAVE ONE PART TO EACH OF HIS SONS AND KEPT THE FOURTH HIMSELF SAYING THIS WAS MY GOOD AND I HAVE DIVIDED IT AMONG THEM IN MY LIFETIME
WHEREFORE DO THOU DOFF THY CLOTHES AND DON THIS RED GOWN FOR IT IS A SLEEPING GOWN SO SHE TOOK AWAY HIS CLOTHES AND MADE HIM ASSUME THE RED GOWN AND SET ON HIS HEAD AN OLD PATCHED RAG SHE HAD BY HER
IT MAY BE DAMPIER'S GANGA GANJAH OR BANG BHANG WHICH HE JUSTLY DESCRIBES AS ACTING DIFFERENTLY ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIONS
BUT I FOUND MY FEET SWOLLEN SO MADE SHIFT TO MOVE BY SHUFFLING ON MY BREECH AND CRAWLING ON MY KNEES FOR IN THAT ISLAND WERE FOUND STORE OF FRUITS AND SPRINGS OF SWEET WATER
I SALUTED THEM AND THEY RETURNED MY SALAM
BULL ETC
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY-SEVENTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED:--WHEN WE SAW THIS FRIGHTFUL GIANT WE WERE STRUCK WITH EXCEEDING TERROR AND HORROR
I REMEMBER AN OFFICER IN THE BOMBAY ARMY WHO HAVING LEARNED HINDOSTANI FROM WOMEN ALWAYS SPOKE OF HIMSELF IN THE FEMININE AND HUGELY SCANDALISED THE SEPOYS
NOR SHALT THOU WANT READY MONEY FOR THINE EXPENDITURE
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A GREEN AND SMILING COUNTRY FULL OF TREES SPIREING AND BIRDS QUIRING AND GARTHS FRUIT-GROWING AND PALACES HIGHSHOWING AND WATERS A-FLOWING AND ODORIFEROUS FLOWERS A-BLOWING
SHALL SUCH WORDS BE SPOKEN TO THE LIKE OF ME
MOREOVER SHE USED TO SPORT AND JEST WITH HER TILL THE WIFE BECAME CORRUPTED[FN#189 AND COULD NOT ENDURE AN HOUR WITHOUT HER COMPANY
BUT IF THOU HAVE A MIND TO SUFFER WHAT WE HAVE SUFFERED THEN OPEN IT AND THOU SHALT LEARN THE CAUSE OF THAT THOU HAST SEEN US DO
ADDS THAT THE SEAL-RING WAS OF STAMPED STONE AND IRON COPPER AND LEAD
SHE FOUND THE KING DEJECTED AND SORROWFUL TEARFUL-EYED AND HEAVY-HEARTED
A CERTAIN MERCHANT WHO WAS ADDICTED TO JEALOUSY HAD A WIFE THAT WAS A MODEL OF BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS
AND THAT NONE SAVE HE WHO SHALL ACHIEVE THE TREASURE AND BRING ME THE FOUR PRECIOUS THINGS WHICH BE THEREIN SHALL HAVE ANY CLAIM TO TAKE THIS BOOK SO WE ALL AGREED TO THIS CONDITION AND HE CONTINUED O MY SONS KNOW THAT THE TREASURE OF AL-SHAMARDAL IS UNDER THE COMMANDMENT OF THE SONS OF THE RED KING AND YOUR FATHER TOLD ME THAT HE HAD HIMSELF ESSAYED TO OPEN THE TREASURE BUT COULD NOT

FN#254 THE TEXT RECOUNTS THE WHOLE STORY OVER AGAIN
AND I SAID TO MYSELF EAT LITTLE AND DRINK LITTLE

AFTER WHICH THEY SOUGHT FOR THE SADDLE BAGS TILL THEY FOUND THE TWO PAIRS AND TOOK THE ENCHANTED ONE AND ALL THE GOLD FROM ONE POUCH AND JEWELS FROM THE OTHER OF THE UNENCHANTED SAYING THIS WAS OUR FATHER'S GOOD SAID THEIR MOTHER NOT SO BY ALLAH IT BELONGETH TO YOUR BROTHER JUDAR WHO BROUGHT IT FROM THE LAND OF THE MAGHARIBAH SAID THEY THOU LIEST IT WAS OUR FATHER'S PROPERTY
SO I WENT ON AS IN A DREAM AND MAKING SHIFT TO SCRAMBLE THROUGH THE BREACH FOUND MYSELF ON THE SLOPE OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN OVERLOOKING THE SALT SEA AND CUTTING OFF ALL ACCESS THERETO FROM THE ISLAND SO THAT NONE COULD COME AT THAT PART OF THE BEACH FROM THE CITY.[FN#52 I PRAISED MY LORD AND THANKED HIM REJOICING GREATLY AND HEARTENING MYSELF WITH THE PROSPECT OF DELIVERANCE
AFTER ASCERTAINING HIS ASCENDANT THEY PRONOUNCED JUDGEMENT IN THESE WORDS WE SEE HIS LOT FAVOURABLE AND HIS LIFE VIABLE AND DURABLE
THEREUPON HIS FLESH AND FAT AND BLOOD BEING IN A PULP HE DIED AND WENT TO HIS DESERTS THE FIRE NO MERCY OF ALLAH BE UPON HIM
WHEN SHE SAW HIM HER REASON FLED AND SHE CRIED OUT TO HER WOMEN SAYING GO FORTH FROM ME TO YOUR OWN PLACES SO THEY WITHDREW AND SHE ROSE AND KISSED GHARIB'S HAND SAYING WELCOME TO MY LORD WHO DELIVERED ME FROM THE GHUL
THEN HE ENTERED THE PALACE AND FOUND JUDAR SITTING IN SUCH STATE AS NOR KING NOR SULTAN COULD EVEN
AND WHEN MY TERROR HAD SUBSIDED I LOOKED ABOUT ME AND I FOUND MYSELF AMONG THE BONES OF ELEPHANTS WHEREBY I CONCLUDED THAT THIS WAS THEIR BURIAL-PLACE AND THAT THE MONSTER ELEPHANT HAD LED ME THITHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE TUSKS.[FN#103 SO I AROSE AND WALKED A WHOLE DAY AND NIGHT TILL I ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF MY MASTER WHO SAW MY COLOUR CHANGED BY STRESS OF AFFRIGHT AND FAMINE
I WENT UP TO HIM AND SPAKE HIM FAIR EXCUSING MYSELF TO HIM AND SAYING O MY COMRADE IT IS NOT THUS THAT FRIEND SHOULD DEAL WITH FRIEND QUOTH HE IT WAS THOU WHO WELL-NIGH DESTROYED US BY THY TASBIH AND THY GLORIFYING GOD ON MY BACK QUOTH I PARDON ME FOR I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MATTER

THEN WHEN THE SUN CEASETH FROM IT IT CONGEALETH AGAIN
MEANWHILE JUDAR SUMMONED THE MARID AND SAID TO HIM IT IS MY WILL THAT THOU BRING ME SOME OF THE IFRITS AT THY COMMAND IN THE GUISE OF GUARDS AND STATION THEM IN THE OPEN SQUARE BEFORE THE PALACE THAT THE KING MAY SEE THEM AND BE AWED BY THEM
THEN THEY FARED ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE CHIEF MARKET-PLACE FULL OF LOFTY BUILDINGS WHEREOF NONE OVERPASSED THE OTHERS AND FOUND ALL ITS SHOPS OPEN WITH THE SCALES HUNG OUT AND THE BRAZEN VESSELS ORDERED AND THE CARAVANSERAIS FULL OF ALL MANNER GOODS
SO HE SENT FOR HER TO THE PRESENCE AND FELL TO KISSING HER HEAD AND WITH MANY TEARS SOUGHT PARDON OF HER
THEN HE REPAIRED TO HIS OWN HOUSE AND SAT DOWN ON HIS COUCH AND CHANCING TO PUT HIS HAND UNDER THE CUSHION BEHOLD HE FOUND THE KING'S SEAL-RING
COME TO MY HELP O MY FRIENDS
AND DISAPPEARING STRAIGHT WAY GATHERED TOGETHER ALL HE FOUND IN THE TREASURY AND RETURNED WITH THE TWO PAIRS OF SADDLE BAGS AND THE DEPOSITS THEREIN AND LAID THEM BEFORE JUDAR SAYING O MY LORD I HAVE LEFT NOTHING IN THE TREASURY JUDAR GAVE THE TREASURE TO HIS MOTHER BIDDING HER KEEP IT AND LAYING THE ENCHANTED SADDLE BAGS BEFORE HIM SAID TO THE JINNI I COMMAND THEE TO BUILD ME THIS NIGHT A LOFTY PALACE AND OVERLAY IT WITH LIQUID GOLD AND FURNISH IT WITH MAGNIFICENT FURNITURE

FOR THIS IS THE PALACE OF THY FATHER-IN-LAW AND HIS DAUGHTER SO HE CAME DOWN AND THE IFRIT FLEW AWAY AND LEFT HIM ON THE ROOF OF THE PALACE
UPON THIS RESOLVE I TOOK A GREAT STORE OF CASH AND BUYING GOODS AND GEAR FIT FOR TRAVEL BOUND THEM UP IN BALES
SO I WILL BID IT BEAR ME TO THEE ON MY CARPET AND MAKE THEE A WARNING AND AN EXAMPLE TO DETER OTHERS BUT THE KING MADE ANSWER TO HIS MESSENGER SAYING IT MAY NOT ON ANY WISE BE AS HE REQUIRETH OF ME

AND IF THEY PROFESS THEY SHALL BE SAVED BUT IF THEY REFUSE WE WILL BURN THEM WITH FIRE SO THE TEN ELDERS RETURNED AND EXPOUNDED AL-ISLAM TO THEIR PEOPLE AND SET FORTH TO THEM THE PATH OF TRUTH AND CREED AND THEY EMBRACED THE FAITH OF SUBMISSION WITH HEART AND TONGUE
BUT THE THIRD WAZIR CAME IN AND SAID TO HIS BROTHER MINISTERS I WILL WARRANT YOU FROM THE KING'S MISCHIEF THIS DAY AND GOING IN TO HIM KISSED THE GROUND BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND SAID O KING I AM THY TRUE COUNSELLOR AND SOLICITOUS FOR THEE AND FOR THINE ESTATE AND INDEED I REDE THEE THE BEST OF REDE

BUT AFTER

THEN HE BADE BRING FORTH MONEY AND APPAREL AND CLAD THEM IN SUMPTUOUS ROBES OF HONOUR AND SHOWERED LARGESSE UPON THEM WHEREFORE THEY ALL LOVED HIM AND OBEYED HIM
SO THAT NEITHER MAY ENJOY LIFE AFTER LOSING HIS OR HER MATE BY ALLAH CRIED I THIS IS A MOST VILE LEWD CUSTOM AND NOT TO BE ENDURED OF ANY MEANWHILE BEHOLD THE MOST PART OF THE TOWNSFOLK CAME IN AND FELL TO CONDOLING WITH MY GOSSIP FOR HIS WIFE AND FOR HIMSELF
AT THIS HE CRIED OUT SAYING ALLAHO AKBAR--GOD IS MOST GREAT AND THE FOLK WITHOUT ANSWERED HIM WITH THE SAME WORDS REJOICING AND THANKING HIM FOR HIS DEED
EITHER DIVORCE HER OR USE HER KINDLY FOR WE KNOW HER PRUDENCE AND PURITY AND CHASTITY

333=944 THE YOUTH OF BAGHDAD STUDIED SWIMMING AND IT IS SAID THAT THEY COULD SWIM HOLDING CHAFING-DISHES UPON WHICH WERE COOKING-POTS AND KEEP AFLOAT TILL THE MEAT WAS DRESSED
THEN THE TWO ELDER BROTHERS WENT TO THEIR MOTHER AND FLOUTED HER AND BEAT HER AND SEIZING HER MONEY CRAVE HER AWAY
I HAD THREE PRAYERS ACCEPTED OF ALLAH WHEREWITH I MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN ME MY GOOD BOTH IN THIS WORLD AND IN THE NEXT AND NOW TWO WISHES ARE GONE IN PURE WASTE BY THY LEWD WILL AND THERE REMAINETH BUT ONE QUOTH SHE PRAY ALLAH THE MOST HIGH TO RESTORE THEE THY YARD AS IT WAS SO HE PRAYED TO HIS LORD AND HIS PRICKLE WAS RESTORED TO ITS FIRST ESTATE
SO HE SAID TO THE WAZIR I HAVE A MIND TO FOLLOW THAT GAZELLE AND THE MINISTER REPLIED DO WHAT SEEMETH GOOD TO THEE THEREUPON THE PRINCE RODE SINGLE-HANDED AFTER THE GAZELLE TILL HE LOST SIGHT OF HIS COMPANIONS AND CHASED HER ALL THAT DAY TILL DUSK WHEN SHE TOOK REFUGE IN A BIT OF ROCKY GROUND[FN#172 AND DARKNESS CLOSED IN UPON HIM

MEANWHILE THE PRINCE CAST ABOUT FOR A MEANS OF COMING TO HIS DESIRE
AND HE CEASED NOT CRYING AND COMPLAINING AND LEFT EATING AND DRINKING AND PLEASANT SCENTS AND MERRIMENT
AS SOON AS HE KNEW WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM HE CRIED OUT AND WEPT TILL HE FAINTED AWAY AND THE WAZIR CAME UP TO HIM AS IF TO LEARN WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM AND CRIED WHAT AILETH THEE SO HE TOLD HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND THE MINISTER FEIGNED TO CONDOLE WITH HIM AND WEEP FOR HIS AFFLICTION SAYING ALLAH ALMIGHTY BE THY REFUGE IN THINE AFFLICTION
SUCH WAS THEIR CASE
SUCH WAS THEIR CASE

BUT AS THEY LAY IN AMBUSH AMONG THE TREES BEHOLD THERE FELL UPON THEM FIVE HUNDRED TRUE AMALEKITES WHO SLEW SIXTY OF THEM AND MADE FOURSCORE AND TEN PRISONERS AND TRUSSED UP MARDAS WITH HIS ARMS BEHIND HIS BACK

EVERY GREAT PROPHET HAS HIS AGNOMEN
THEY SPENT THE NEXT DAY IN EATING AND DRINKING TILL NIGHTFALL WHEN THE KING'S SON OF THE JINN ASKED THE PRINCE HAST THOU A MIND TO RETURN TO THY PEOPLE THIS VERY NIGHT YES HE ANSWERED
AND WHOSO LOOKETH NOT TO ISSUE AND END HATH NOT FATE TO FRIEND
AND MOUNTING STEED RODE FOR THE PLACE WHERE GHARIB WAS A-HUNTING
WHEN I SAW THIS I WAS CONFOUNDED AND CONCERNED FOR THEM NOR WAS I LESS ANXIOUS ABOUT MYSELF FOR FEAR OF THE NAKED FOLK
THEREUPON THE IFRIT ROSE WITH HIM INTO THE AIR AND CEASED NOT TO FLY BETWEEN SKY AND EARTH WHILST THE PRINCE WAS UNCONSCIOUS NOR WAS THE LAST THIRD OF THE NIGHT COME BEFORE HE ALIGHTED DOWN WITH HIM ON THE TERRACE-ROOF OF HIS FATHER-IN-LAW'S PALACE
THEN JUDAR BRINGING OUT THE RING RUBBED IT AND BADE THE JINNI FETCH HIM A DRESS OF THE BEST WHICH HE GAVE TO THE WAZIR SAYING DON THIS DRESS AND GO TELL THE KING WHAT I SAY SO THE WAZIR DONNED THE DRESS THE LIKE WHEREOF HE HAD NEVER DONNED AND RETURNING TO THE KING TOLD HIM WHAT HAD PASSED AND PRAISED THE PALACE AND THAT WHICH WAS THEREIN SAYING JUDAR BIDDETH THEE TO HIM SO THE KING CALLED OUT UP YE MEN
AND IN THE HIGHEST PLACE SAT A MAN OF WORSHIPFUL AND NOBLE ASPECT WHOSE BEARD-SIDES HOARINESS HAD STRICKEN

AND OF THE LOVING
THUS I ABODE A LONG WHILE,--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
AL-SUWAYS THIS SUCCESSOR OF ANCIENT ARSINOë WAS ACCORDING TO LOCAL TRADITION FOUNDED BY A SANTON FROM AL-SúS IN MAROCCO WHO CALLED IT AFTER HIS NAME LITTLE SúS THE WORMLET FN#99 ARAB
AND MY DISAPPOINTMENT ENDURED FOR A TIME TILL ONE DAY GOING IN TO KING MIHRJAN I FOUND HIM WITH A COMPANY OF INDIANS
WE TOLD HIM ALL CONCERNING OURSELVES AND HE SAID BE OF GOOD CHEER FOR NO HARM SHALL BEFAL YOU AND WHEN WE IN TURN ASKED THEM OF THEIR FAITH WE FOUND THAT EACH WAS OF ONE OF THE MANY CREEDS PREVAILING BEFORE THE PREACHING OF AL-ISLAM AND THE MISSION OF MOHAMMED WHOM MAY ALLAH BLESS AND KEEP
THEN SHE SPRANG UP ON HIS STEED BEHIND HIM WEARING THE MOST LOATHLY OF ASPECTS AND PRESENTLY SHE SAID TO HIM O KING'S SON WHAT AILS THEE THAT I SEE THEE TROUBLED AND THY FAVOUR CHANGED I HAVE BETHOUGHT ME OF SOMEWHAT THAT TROUBLES ME SEEK AID AGAINST IT OF THY FATHER'S TROOPS AND HIS BRAVES HE WHOM I FEAR CARETH NAUGHT FOR TROOPS NEITHER CAN BRAVES AFFRIGHT HIM AID THYSELF AGAINST HIM WITH THY FATHER'S MONIES AND TREASURES HE WHOM I FEAR WILL NOT BE SATISFIED WITH WEALTH YE HOLD THAT YE HAVE IN HEAVEN A GOD WHO SEETH AND IS NOT SEEN AND IS OMNIPOTENT AND OMNISCIENT YES WE HAVE NONE BUT HIM THEN PRAY THOU TO HIM
SO HOW SHALL SHE RETURN THY SALAM ADDING INDEED SHE IS BUT A CORPSE EMBALMED WITH EXCEEDING ART
HE DIVERTED HIMSELF AWHILE BY VIEWING THE PICTURES AND IMAGES THEREIN TILL HE CAME TO ANOTHER DOOR OVER WHICH ALSO WERE WRITTEN VERSES AND SAID TO THE SHAYKH COME READ ME THESE SO HE ADVANCED AND READ AS FOLLOWS UNDER THESE DOMES HOW MANY A COMPANY HALTED OF OLD AND FARED WITH-OUTEN STAY
FOR IT IS THE CUSTOM WITH US IF THE WIFE DIE FIRST TO BURY THE HUSBAND ALIVE WITH HER AND IN LIKE MANNER THE WIFE IF THE HUSBAND DIE FIRST

WHEN HE CAME TO JUDAR'S GATE HE SAW THE SLAVE SITTING THERE
ANIMAL
BUT I SUPPOSE THOU HAST NOT GONE UP TO THE UPPER STORY NEITHER LOOKED OUT FROM THE BELVEDERE THERE SO SAYING SHE WENT HER WAY AND HE FELL A PONDERING HER WORDS AND SAID TO HIMSELF I HAVE NOT GONE UP TO THE TOP OF THE HOUSE
BUT BY THE WAY THIS GHUL CAME OUT AGAINST US AND SLEW SOME OF US AND TAKING THE REST CAPTIVE IMPRISONED US IN THIS HOLD
KINá A TRUE VEIL NOT THE BURKá OR NOSE BAG WITH THE PEEP-HOLES
SO HEARING THE CRY OF THE KEENERS I WENT IN TO CONDOLE WITH HIM ON HIS LOSS AND FOUND HIM IN VERY ILL PLIGHT FULL OF TROUBLE AND WEARY OF SOUL AND MIND
YAGHúS WAS THE GIANT IDOL OF THE MAZHAJ TRIBE AT AKAMAH OF AL-YAMAN AND AFTERWARDS AT NAJRáN AL-UZZá WAS WIDELY WORSHIPPED
BUT AS REGARDS KING SABUR HE ABODE AWAITING HIS DAUGHTER'S RETURN FROM THE MONASTERY OF THE FIRE AND WHEN THE APPOINTED TIME PASSED BY AND SHE CAME NOT FLAMES RAGED IN HIS HEART
NO HARM SHALL BEFALL YOU THEN HE COMFORTED THEM AND SET THEIR HEARTS AT EASE AND RELATED TO THEM ALL HE HAD SUFFERED TILL HE FELL IN WITH SHAYKH ABD AL-SAMAD AND TOLD THEM ALSO OF THE SEAL RING
SAY ME THEN WILT THOU UNDERTAKE THE CHARGE AND LAND AND SELL THEM AS OTHER MERCHANTS DO I REPLIED HEARKENING AND OBEDIENCE TO THEE O MY LORD
THE EARTH TREMBLED UNDER OUR FEET AND THE AIR RUMBLED WITH A TERRIBLE TONE
AND I BESEECH THEE TO INTERCEDE FOR HIM WITH THE CHIEF OF POLICE WHEN THE KAZI LOOKED ON HER HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER FORTHRIGHT AND SAID TO HER ENTER THE HOUSE AND REST AWHILE WITH MY HANDMAIDS WHILST I SEND TO THE WALI TO RELEASE THY BROTHER
AND MUSA ANSWERED SAYING GO AND THE BLESSING OF ALLAH GO WITH THEE SO THE MAN MOUNTED THE LADDER
HAPLY WE SHALL FIND THEREIN WHEREWITHAL TO WIN THE FAVOUR OF THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL ALLAH PROLONG THE EMIR'S FORTUNE REPLIED TALIB LET US MAKE A LADDER AND MOUNT THE WALL THEREWITH SO PERADVENTURE WE MAY COME AT THE GATE FROM WITHIN QUOTH THE EMIR THIS IS WHAT OCCURRED TO MY THOUGHT ALSO AND ADMIRABLE IS THE ADVICE THEN HE CALLED FOR CARPENTERS AND BLACKSMITHS AND BADE THEM FASHION WOOD AND BUILD A LADDER PLATED AND BANDED WITH IRON
AND HE ANSWERED O MY LORD I HAVE WITH ME TWO HUNDRED HORSE O GHARIB REJOINED THE HERMIT HADST THOU TEN THOUSAND RIDERS YET SHOULDEST THOU NOT PREVAIL AGAINST HIM FOR HIS NAME IS THE-GHUL WHO-EATETH-MEN-WE-PRAY-ALLAH-FOR-SAFETY AND HE IS OF THE CHILDREN OF HAM
AND SHáM TO CAIRO AND TO ADNANWONE;[FN#119 I REIGNED IN GLORY CONQUERING MANY KINGS
THE HISTORY OF GHARIB AND HIS BROTHER AJIB THE BOOK OF THE THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN[FN#1 AND SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN
THEREUPON SA'ADAN CRIED TO HIS SLAVES SAYING TAKE THIS FATTED CALF AND ROAST HIM QUICKLY SO THEY HASTENED TO SKIN THE INFIDEL AND ROASTED HIM AND BROUGHT HIM TO THE GHUL WHO ATE HIS FLESH AND CRUNCHED HIS BONES.[FN#364 NOW WHEN THE KAFIRS SAW HOW SA'ADAN DID WITH THEIR FELLOW THEIR HAIR AND PILE STOOD ON END
O MY SON SAID SHE WHENCE HAST THOU THIS SO HE TOLD HER AND SHE SAID GO NOT AGAIN TO LAKE KARUN INDEED I FEAR FOR THEE FROM THE MOORS SAID HE O MY MOTHER I DO BUT CAST THEM IN BY THEIR OWN WISH AND WHAT AM I TO DO
BY AND BY THE EMIRS AND CAPTAINS ENTERED AND FINDING THEIR KING SLAIN AND HIS SON AJIB SEATED ON THE THRONE WERE CONFOUNDED IN MIND AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO
THIS THEN IS THE END OF THE STORY OF MY SECOND VOYAGE
TO WHICH HE REPLIED I PAINTED IT AFTER A CERTAIN SINGING-GIRL BELONGING TO ONE OF THE WAZIRS IN THE CITY OF CASHMERE IN THE LAND OF HIND WHEN THE GOLDSMITH HEARD THIS HE LEFT PERSIA FOR CASHMERE-CITY WHERE HE ARRIVED AFTER MUCH TRAVAIL
SIMPLE VIVISEPULTURE WAS AND IS PRACTISED BY MANY PEOPLE
VON HAMMER BELIEVES IT INHERITED THE NAME OF THE OLD CHARON'S LAKE OF MEMPHIS OVER WHICH CORPSES WERE FERRIED
INDEED THEY PRETEND THAT WOMEN ARE FULL OF TRICKS AND MALICE AND PERFIDY
AND WHEN SUMMONED AND EXAMINED BY HIS SIRE BEHOLD HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS AS NIL
AND HE ANSWERED ASSUREDLY WE DO WITH HIM EVEN AS THOU HAST SEEN WHEN I HEARD THIS MY GALL-BLADDER WAS LIKE TO BURST FOR THE VIOLENCE OF MY DISMAY AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF
FOR THE FAVOURITE CHAFF AGAINST THEM EATING THE DOG NOT THE PUPPY-PIE SEE PILGRIMAGE I
THERE I FOREGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO REJOICED IN MY HAPPY RETURN AND GAVE MY JOY OF MY SAFETY
FOR EACH IS BETTER THAN AUGHT THOU COULDST GET OTHERWISE
WHERETO HE ANSWERED IN THE PALACE BUT HE STIRRED NOT FROM HIS LEANING POSTURE
SO LET THY DAUGHTER GO WITH ME THAT SHE MAY DIVERT HERSELF AND MAKE MERRY WITH US AND THROW OFF HER CARK AND CARE AND FORGET THE RUIN OF HER HOME
WHO IMPRISONED HIM ENQUIRED HE
OTHERWISE THE MURDERER MAY COME TO BE CANONISED
BUT IF THOU SEE ME COME UP FEET FOREMOST THEN KNOW THAT I AM DEAD
HAPLY HE WILL DISCOVER TO THEE HIS CASE ALLAH ASSAIN THEE EMIR
AND HE BEHELD ALL THINGS PROSTRATING THEMSELVES BEFORE THEIR LORD EACH IN ITS SEVERAL STEAD
WHILST THE WICKED OLD WOMAN BROUGHT THE MAN WHO WAS THE HUSBAND AND HOUSE-MASTER INTO THE SALOON AND MADE HIM SIT DOWN CONGRATULATING HERSELF ON HER CUNNING CONTRIVANCE
AND OTHER TRAVELLERS HAVE REPORTED 4 METRES
AS I LOOKED AND WONDERED AT THE MARVELLOUS WORKS OF THE ALMIGHTY THE BIRD ALIGHTED ON THE DOME AND BROODED OVER IT WITH ITS WINGS COVERING IT AND ITS LEGS STRETCHED OUT BEHIND IT ON THE GROUND AND IN THIS POSTURE IT FELL ASLEEP GLORY BE TO HIM WHO SLEEPETH NOT
467=A.D
AND THOSE WHO TESTIFIED AGAINST HIM BORE FALSE WITNESS
SO EXPOUND YE TO ME THE MEANING OF THIS DREAM THE INTERPRETERS LOOKED ONE AT OTHER
SEE THEN O KING SAID THE DAMSEL THE MALICE OF MEN AND THEIR WILES
SíMURGH =THE THIRTY-FOWL LIKE THE BAR YUCHRE OF THE RABBIS THE GARUDA OF THE HINDUS
WHEN THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE CASTLE OF SHAYS SA'ADAN AND HIS SONS SALLIED FORTH TO THEM BUT GHARIB HAD CHARGED THEM SAYING IF THE GHUL OF THE MOUNTAIN COME OUT TO YOU AND OFFER TO ATTACK YOU DO YE CALL UPON THE NAME OF ALLAH THE ALL-CREATOR AND HE WILL LEAVE HIS HOSTILE INTENT AND RECEIVE YOU HOSPITABLY SO WHEN HE WOULD HAVE FALLEN UPON THEM THEY CALLED ALOUD UPON THE NAME OF ALMIGHTY ALLAH AND STRAIGHTWAY HE RECEIVED THEM KINDLY AND ASKED THEM OF THEIR CASE
FN#245 ARAB
HERE THE PHRASE WOULD MEAN NONE COULD APPROACH THEM WHEN THEY WERE WROTH
THEN SHALT THOU CARRY HIM FORTH THE HOUSE UNDER COVER OF THE NIGHT AND AFTER DO THOU WITH HIM AS THOU WILT REJOINED THE CAPTAIN WITH ALL MY HEART
THEN SAID THE IFRIT DISMOUNT AND OPEN THINE EYES
IN THY PALACE ARE NINETY CONCUBINES OF VARIOUS COLOURS BUT THEIR TASTE IS ONE."[FN#162 WHEN THE KING HEARD THIS HE WAS ASHAMED AND RISING HASTILY WENT OUT WITHOUT OFFERING HER ANY AFFRONT AND RETURNED TO HIS PALACE
AND SHE REPLIED O MAN HOW BLESSED IS THE HOUR OF THY COMING
THE CANOPY WAS SPREAD ABOVE A JETTING FOUNTAIN OF IVORY AND CARNELIAN PLATED WITH GLITTERING GOLD AND THEREBY STOOD A COUCH SET WITH PEARLS AND RUBIES AND OTHER JEWELS AND BESIDE THE COUCH A PILLAR OF GOLD
THEY DRANK AND MAKING THE WUZU ABLUTION PRAYED THE MID AFTERNOON PRAYER
SO THEY STRIKE TOGETHER PIECES OF WOOD AND PUT IT TO FLIGHT.[FN#17 I ALSO SAW ANOTHER FISH WITH A HEAD LIKE THAT OF AN OWL BESIDES MANY OTHER WONDERS AND RARITIES WHICH IT WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO RECOUNT
GO AND BRING ME NEWS OF YONDER DUST SO A CAVALIER TOOK HORSE AND RIDING OFF RETURNED AFTER A WHILE AND SAID O KING WE FOUND UNDER THAT DUST AN HUNDRED HORSE BELONGING TO AN EMIR HIGHS SAHIM AL-LAYL GHARIB HEARING THESE WORDS CRIED OUT O MY LORD THIS IS MY BROTHER WHOM I HAD SENT ON AN ERRAND AND I WILL GO FORTH TO MEET HIM SO SAYING HE MOUNTED WITH HIS HUNDRED MEN OF THE BANU KAHTAN AND A THOUSAND PERSIANS AND RODE TO MEET HIS BROTHER IN GREAT STATE BUT GREATNESS BELONGETH TO GOD ALONE.[FN#358 WHEN THE TWO CAME UP WITH EACH OTHER THEY DISMOUNTED AND EMBRACED AND GHARIB SAID TO SAHIM O MY BROTHER HAST THOU BROUGHT OUR TRIBE TO THE CASTLE OF SASA AND THE WADY OF BLOSSOMS O MY BROTHER REPLIED SAHIM WHEN THE PERFIDIOUS DOG MARDAS HEARD THAT THOU HADST MADE THEE MASTER OF THE STRONGHOLD BELONGING TO THE MOUNTAIN-GHUL HE WAS SORE CHAGRINED AND SAID EXCEPT I MARCH HENCE GHARIB WILL COME AND CARRY OFF MY DAUGHTER MAHDIYAH WITHOUT DOWER SO HE TOOK HIS
AND THE SHAYKH ANSWERED WHAT IF HE SAY I WILL TAKE THE MEASURE FULL OF GOLD OR SILVER WILT THOU GIVE IT TO HIM YES REPLIED THE OTHER I WILL GIVE IT TO HIM AND STILL BE THE GAINER AND THE SHAYKH ANSWERED AND IF HE SAY I WILL TAKE THE MEASURE FULL OF FLEAS,[FN#250 HALF MALE AND HALF FEMALE WHAT WILT THOU DO SO THE SHARPER KNEW THAT HE WAS WORSTED
PRESENTLY THE KING PUT HIS HAND TO HER NECK AND SOUGHT TO DO HIS DESIRE OF HER
WHEN THEREFORE
STILL THE POPULAR PHRASE
THE EXACT TIME IS KNOWN ONLY TO PROPHETS
IF HE WILL LET HIM TORTURE HER AND IF HE WILL LET HIM KILL HER QUOTH THE PRINCE PARDON IS BETTER THAN VENGEANCE AND MERCY IS OF THE QUALITY OF THE NOBLE AND THE KING REPEATED TIS FOR THEE TO DECIDE O MY SON SO THE PRINCE SET HER FREE SAYING DEPART FROM OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD AND ALLA PARDON WHAT IS PAST THEREWITH THE KING ROSE FROM HIS THRONE OF ESTATE AND SEATING HIS SON THEREON CROWNED HIM WITH HIS CROWN AND BADE THE GRANDEES OF HIS REALM SWEAR FEALTY AND COMMANDED THEM DO HOMAGE TO HIM
HIS NAME IS ABD AL-RAHIM AND HE IS NO JEW BUT A TRUE BELIEVER OF THE MALIKI SCHOOL
BUT WE WERE IN TERRIBLE FEAR OF HIM AND MADE SURE WE WERE DEAD MEN DESPAIRING OF ESCAPE
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-SEVENTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED:--SO WHEN I ESCAPED DROWNING AND REACHED THE ISLAND WHICH AFFORDED ME FRUIT TO EAT AND WATER TO DRINK I RETURNED THANKS TO THE MOST HIGH AND GLORIFIED HIM
WHEREUPON THE HUSBAND BEGAN TO KISS HER HANDS SAYING ALLAH ALMIGHTY REQUITE THEE WITH ALL GOOD FOR THAT THOU HAST DELIVERED ME FROM HER AND THE OLD WOMAN MARVELLED AT THE WIFE'S CUNNING AND READY WIT
THUS DID THEY RAISE SUCH A TEMPEST OF RAIN AND LIGHTNING THAT THE PARROT WAS DRENCHED AND HALF-DROWNED IN A DELUGE
AND ITS FRUITAGE WAS RIPE FOR PLUCKING WHEN I GAVE IT TO THIS THY WAZIR WHO ATE OF IT WHAT SEEMED GOOD TO HIM THEN DESERTED IT AND WATERED IT NOT SO THAT ITS BLOOM WILTED AND WITHERED AND ITS SHEEN DEPARTED AND ITS STATE CHANGED THEN SAID THE WAZIR O MY KING THIS MAN SAITH SOOTH
BUT SUCH VILLANIES MUST OFTEN HAVE OCCURRED IN THE EAST AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND PLACES WITHOUT REQUIRING DIRECT DERIVATION

AFTER WHICH JUDAR SAID TO HER O MY MOTHER WHEN THOU HAST MADE AN END OF EATING EMPTY WHAT IS LEFT OF THE FOOD INTO DISHES OTHER THAN THESE AND RESTORE THE EMPTY PLATTERS TO THE SADDLE BAGS CAREFULLY SO SHE AROSE AND LAID THEM UP IN A SAFE PLACE
THEN I THREW MYSELF DOWN ON THE BONES OF THE DEAD AND LAY THERE IMPLORING ALLAH'S HELP AND IN THE VIOLENCE OF MY DESPAIR INVOKING DEATH WHICH CAME NOT TO ME TILL THE FIRE OF HUNGER BURNED MY STOMACH AND THIRST SET MY THROAT AFLAME WHEN I SAT UP AND FEELING FOR THE BREAD ATE A MORSEL AND UPON IT SWALLOWED A MOUTHFUL OF WATER
WHEN THE OLD WOMAN SAW HER AMAZEMENT SHE SAID TO HER THE NAME OF ALLAH BE UPON THEE O MY DAUGHTER
MANY OTHERS ARE IN LUCK AND FROM MISERIES ARE FREE AND FORTUNE NEVER LOADS THEM WITH LOADS THE LIKE O MINE
NOTHING CAN AVERT WHAT IS FATED AND FORE-ORDAINED OF ALLAH THE MOST HIGH
SO SHE CAME UP TO HER AND KISSED HER HANDS AND FEET TILL SHE MADE PEACE BETWEEN THEM AND THEY SAT DOWN TOGETHER
AFTER WHICH THE ELDER BROTHER TOLD HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HE PUT TEN CAPTAINS AT HIS COMMANDMENT UNDER EACH ONE'S HAND TEN THOUSAND HORSE OF THE DOUGHTIEST OF THE ARABS AND THE AJAMS WHO EQUIPPED THEMSELVES AND WERE READY TO DEPART IN THREE DAYS

RECOUNT TO ME WHAT AILETH THEE SO HE TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD PASSED FROM FIRST TO LAST AND SHE SAID AS FOR HIM WHO DIDDLED THEE IN THE MATTER OF THE CHANDERS-WOOD THOU MUST KNOW THAT WITH US IT IS WORTH TEN GOLD PIECES A POUND
AND ALL THE MERCHANTS WHO FETCH JEWELS FROM THE VALLEY OF DIAMONDS SAW ME THERE AND WILL BEAR ME WITNESS THAT I AM THE VERY SINDBAD THE SEAMAN
THERE CAME TO HIM A CAVALIER ON A BRIGHT-BAY STEED[FN#184 WITH A CROWN ON HIS HEAD AS HE WERE OF THE SONS OF THE KINGS AND SAID TO HIM WHO BROUGHT THEE HITHER O YOUTH THE PRINCE TOLD HIM HIS MISHAP HOW HE WAS WENDING TO HIS WEDDING AND HOW THE WAZIR HAD LED HIM TO A SPRING WHEREOF HE DRANK AND INCURRED WHAT HAD OCCURRED
MOREOVER O KING CONTINUED THE WAZIR THERE HATH REACHED ME ANOTHER STORY OF THE MALICE OF WOMEN WHAT IS THAT ASKED THE KING AND THE WAZIR SAID KNOW O KING THAT IT IS ANENT THE WIFE'S DEVICE TO CHEAT HER HUSBAND THERE WAS ONCE A WOMAN WHO HAD NO EQUAL IN HER DAY FOR BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS AND GRACE AND PERFECTION

ONE DAY HE SAID TO HIM HARKYE SUCH AN ONE
A FURIOUS KNIGHT
I WILL BEAR THY GIFT TO HIM AND INFORM HIM THAT THOU ART HIS SINCERE LOVER AND TRUE FRIEND THEN I ABODE WITH THE KING IN GREAT HONOUR AND REGARD AND CONSIDERATION FOR A LONG WHILE TILL ONE DAY AS I SAT IN HIS PALACE I HEARD NEWS OF A COMPANY OF MERCHANTS THAT WERE FITTING OUT A SHIP FOR BASSORAH AND SAID TO MYSELF I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN VOYAGE WITH THESE MEN SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND

O SON OF ADAM LET NOT THE DECEITS OF THY DAYS AND NIGHTS AND TIMES AND HOURS DELUDE THEE WITH THEIR DELIGHTS
WHEN GHARIB SAW THE FIVE AMALEKITES APPROACHING HE PLIED SHOVEL-IRON UPON HIS STEED'S FLANK AND CRIED OUT SAYING WHO ARE YE AND WHAT IS YOUR RACE AND WHAT DO YE REQUIRE WHEREUPON FALHúN BIN SA'ADAN THE ELDEST OF THE FIVE CAME OUT AND SAID DISMOUNT YE AND BIND ONE ANOTHER[FN#336 AND WE WILL DRIVE YOU TO OUR FATHER THAT HE MAY ROAST VARIOUS OF YOU AND BOIL VARIOUS FOR IT IS LONG SINCE HE HAS TASTED THE FLESH OF ADAM-SON WHEN GHARIB HEARD THESE WORDS HE DROVE AT FALHUN SHAKING HIS MACE SO THAT THE RINGS RANG LIKE THE ROARING THUNDER AND THE GIANT WAS CONFOUNDED

NOR CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WIDE DIFFUSION OF THIS TALE OF PERILS UNLESS TO ENHANCE THE VALUE OF THE GEM
AND IF HE WILL HE MAY THEREWITH MAKE HIMSELF MASTER OF THE EARTH IN ALL THE LENGTH AND BREADTH THEREOF

QUOTH THE MOOR BRING ME THE TWO CASKETS THAT ARE IN THE SADDLE BAGS SO JUDAR BROUGHT THEM AND OPENED THEM TO HIM AND HE LAID IN EACH CASKET A FISH AND SHUT THEM UP
SO WE FLED FROM BEFORE HIM AND COULD NOT PREVAIL AGAINST HIM AT THIS THE KING WAS WROTH AND SAID LET AN HUNDRED MEN GO DOWN TO HIM ACCORDINGLY THE HUNDRED MEN WENT DOWN TO ATTACK HIM

THEN HE WATCHED GHARIB TILL ONE DAY HE WENT FORTH TO HUNT AND RODE FAR AWAY AMONGST THE DELLS AND HILLS
AND A LONGING SEIZED ME TO TRAFFIC AND TO MAKE MONEY BY TRADE
HAPLY HIS SIN IS BUT A SLIGHT SLIP WHICH THIS DAMSEL HATH MADE GREAT TO THEE
BUT IN HIS HASTE AND CONFUSION HE FORGOT HIS SIGNET-RING AND LEFT IT UNDER THE CUSHION WHERE HE HAD BEEN SITTING AND ALBEIT HE REMEMBERED IT HE WAS ASHAMED TO SEND FOR IT

BUT GHARIB DROVE STEED AFTER HIM AND SMITING HIM WITH HIS MACE BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS THREW HIM FROM HIS HORSE
AND IF THOU SAY TO HIM BRING ME TO MY NATIVE CITY THIS VERY DAY HE WILL NOT DISOBEY THY COMMANDMENT SO HE TOOK LEAVE OF MOOR ABD AL-SAMAD AND RUBBED THE RING WHEREUPON AL-RA'AD PRESENTED HIMSELF SAYING ADSUM
AFTER WHICH ABD AL-SAMAD BROUGHT OUT THE WAND AND THE TABLETS AS BEFORE AND KINDLING THE FIRE IN THE CHAFING DISH MADE READY THE INCENSE
ASKED THE DAMSEL WHO IS THERE

AS SOON AS THE REST OF THE COMPANY WAS ASSEMBLED HE SET MEAT AND DRINK BEFORE THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD WELL EATEN AND DRUNKEN AND WERE MERRY AND IN CHEERFUL CASE HE TOOK UP HIS DISCOURSE AND RECOUNTED TO THEM IN THESE WORDS THE NARRATIVE OF THE SECOND VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN
MOREOVER O KING CONTINUED THE SECOND WAZIR I HAVE HEARD TELL OF THE MALICE OF WOMEN A TALE OF THE LADY AND HER TWO LOVERS

SO WHEN WE DESPAIRED OF SUCCOUR WE DISPLAYED ALL OUR RICHES AND THINGS OF PRICE AND SHUTTING THE GATES OF THE CITY AND ITS STRONG PLACES RESIGNED OURSELVES TO THE DEME OF OUR LORD AND COMMITTED OUR CASE TO OUR KING
I AMONGST THE NUMBER AND WHEN WE GOT ASHORE WE FOUND A GREAT ISLAND OR RATHER PENINSULA[FN#72 WHOSE BASE WAS STREWN WITH WRECKAGE OF CRAFTS AND GOODS AND GEAR CAST UP BY THE SEA FROM BROKEN SHIPS WHOSE PASSENGERS HAD BEEN DROWNED
WHEREFORE HIS HEART WAS FREE FROM CARE FOR HE HAD HIS SPY AT HOME
AND DO THOU SAY TO THE MERCHANT THOU KNOWEST O MY LORD THE FACE VEIL I BOUGHT OF THEE FOR FIFTY DINARS
FOR WHO SHALL SWEETEN ITS GALL OR QUENCH ITS FIRES
I TOLD THEM ALL MY ADVENTURES FROM FIRST TO LAST WHEREAT THEY MARVELLED MIGHTILY AND COVERED MY SHAME[FN#34 WITH SOME OF THEIR CLOTHES

FN#125 THIS SON OF BARACHIA HAS BEEN NOTICED BEFORE
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY-FIRST NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE KING HEARD THIS STORY HE TURNED FROM SLAYING HIS SON
AND I RELATED TO THEM ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN ME
THENCE THEY PASSED TO THE PERFUMERS BAZAR WHERE THEY FOUND THE SHOPS FILLED WITH DRUGS OF ALL KINDS AND BLADDERS OF MUSK AND AMBERGRIS AND NADD-SCENT AND CAMPHOR AND OTHER PERFUMES IN VESSELS OF IVORY AND EBONY AND KHALANJ-WOOD AND ANDALUSIAN COPPER THE WHICH IS EQUAL IN VALUE TO GOLD
SO THEY DREW NEAR AND ASKED HER SAY ART THOU A MORTAL OR A JINNIYAH ANSWERED SHE I AM A MORTAL O CHIEFS OF THE ARABS THEREUPON THEY TOLD THEIR EMIR WHOSE NAME WAS MARDáS PRINCE OF THE BANú KAHTáN,[FN#317 AND WHO HAD COME FORTH THAT DAY TO HUNT WITH FIVE HUNDRED OF HIS COUSINS AND THE NOBLES OF HIS TRIBE AND WHO IN THE COURSE OF THE CHASE HAD HAPPENED UPON HER
THE NATIVES ARE CALLED FáRIKí
BUT ON THE THIRD DAY THE FAVOURITE CAME IN TO HIM AND KISSING THE GROUND BEFORE HIM CRIED O KING DO ME JUSTICE ON THY SON AND BE NOT TURNED FROM THY PURPOSE BY THY MINISTERS PRATE FOR THERE IS NO GOOD IN WICKED WAZIRS AND BE NOT AS THE KING OF BAGHDAD WHO RELIED ON THE WORD OF A CERTAIN WICKED COUNSELLOR OF HIS QUOTH HE AND HOW WAS THAT QUOTH SHE THERE HATH BEEN TOLD ME O AUSPICIOUS AND WELL-ADVISED KING A TALE OF THE KINGS SON AND THE OGRESS.[FN#171 A CERTAIN KING HAD A SON WHOM HE LOVED AND FAVOURED WITH EXCEEDING FAVOUR OVER ALL HIS OTHER CHILDREN
THEN HE TOOK THEM AND GOING UP TO THE PORTAL UNDID THE PADLOCKS AND DREW BACK THE BOLTS AND BARS WHEREUPON THE GREAT LEAVES FLEW OPEN WITH A CRASH LIKE THE PEALING THUNDER BY REASON OF ITS GREATNESS AND TERRIBLENESS
THEN HE SAID TO HIM WHAT WILT THOU HAVE O MY BROTHER ANYTHING ALLAH UPON THEE TELL ME WHAT THOU HAST A MIND TO BREAD AND CHEESE O MY POOR FELLOW
QUOTH MARDAS WHAT MEANETH THIS CASE O GHARIB
SO WHEN HE KNEW THAT SHE WAS TO BE MARRIED TO ANOTHER ENVY AND JEALOUSY GAT HOLD OF HIM AND HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF AND SENT A NOBLE PRESENT TO THE WAZIR OF THE BRIDEGROOM'S FATHER AND MUCH TREASURE DESIRING HIM TO USE CRAFT FOR SLAYING THE PRINCE OR CONTRIVE TO MAKE HIM LEAVE HIS INTENT OF ESPOUSING THE GIRL AND ADDING O WAZIR INDEED JEALOUSY MOVETH ME TO THIS FOR SHE IS MY COUSIN."[FN#180 THE WAZIR ACCEPTED THE PRESENT AND SENT AN ANSWER SAYING BE OF GOOD CHEER AND OF EYES COOL AND CLEAR FOR I WILL DO ALL THAT THOU WISHEST PRESENTLY THE BRIDE'S FATHER WROTE TO THE PRINCE BIDDING HIM TO HIS CAPITAL THAT HE MIGHT GO IN TO HIS DAUGHTER
SEE NIGHT DCXXV
WE COULD HAVE NO FINER LOOT THAN THIS THEN I AND MY SONS FELL UPON THE PERSIANS AND SLEW OF THEM THREE HUNDRED MEN AND TOOK THE PRINCESS AND TWELVE HUNDRED CAVALIERS PRISONERS TOGETHER WITH ALL THAT WAS WITH HER OF TREASURE AND RICHES AND BROUGHT THEM TO THIS OUR CASTLE QUOTH GHARIB HAST THOU OFFERED ANY VIOLENCE TO THE PRINCESS FAKHR TAJ QUOTH SA'ADAN NOT I AS THY HEAD LIVETH AND BY THE VIRTUE OF THE FAITH I HAVE BUT NOW EMBRACED GHARIB REPLIED IT WAS WELL DONE OF THEE O SA'ADAN FOR HER FATHER IS KING OF THE WORLD AND DOUBTLESS HE WILL DESPATCH TROOPS IN QUEST OF HER AND LAY WASTE THE DWELLINGS OF THOSE WHO TOOK HER
WHEN IT WAS THE SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOURTH NIGHT SHE CONTINUED IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SáLIM SAID TO THE OFFICERS WILL YE ACCEPT ME AS YOUR SULTAN OTHERWISE I WILL RUB THE RING AND THE MARID SHALL SLAY YOU ALL GREAT AND SMALL
AND SHE ANSWERED O KING THIS THY SON WHOM THY COURTIERS AVOUCH TO BE DUMB REQUIRED ME OF MYSELF AND I REPELLED HIM WHEREUPON HE DID WITH ME AS THOU SEEST AND WOULD HAVE SLAIN ME
WHEN IT WAS THE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FIRST NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT KING SABUR SENT HIS TROOPS IN QUEST OF HIS DAUGHTER WHOSE MOTHER CLAD HERSELF AND HER WOMEN IN BLACK
NOW IT CHANCED THAT A JANISSARY[FN#291 OF THE KING'S GUARDS WAS A GUEST IN THE HOUSE ADJOINING JUDAR'S AND HEARD THEM THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW

AND QUOTH THE CALIPH OF A TRUTH WE HEAR FROM THOSE WHO FOREWENT US THAT THE LORD EXTOLLED AND EXALTED BE HE VOUCHSAFED UNTO NONE THE LIKE OF THAT WHICH HE VOUCHSAFED UNTO OUR LORD SOLOMON AND THAT HE ATTAINED UNTO THAT WHERETO NEVER ATTAINED OTHER THAN HE IN THAT HE WAS WONT TO IMPRISON JINNS AND MARIDS AND SATANS IN CUCURBITES OF COPPER AND TO STOP THEM WITH LEAD AND SEAL[FN#105 THEM WITH HIS RING."--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY

FN#89 THIS IS PROBABLY CLASSICAL
SO WHENEVER THE YOUTH WAS STRAITENED IN BREAST BY THE TEDIUM AND ENNUI OF LONELINESS HE APPLIED HIMSELF DILIGENTLY TO HIS OBJECT-LESSONS AND MASTERED ALL THE DEDUCTIONS THEREFROM
SHE DID AS HE TOLD HER AND WHEN JUDAR SAW THE PRINCESS WHO HAD NOT HER MATCH FOR BEAUTY AND GRACE HE LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HER AND SAID AH
AFTER WHICH I GATHERED GRAPES FROM A VINE WHICH GREW HARD BY AND SQUEEZED THEM INTO THE GOURD TILL IT WAS FULL OF THE JUICE
THEN THE WAZIR WROTE TO THE LADY'S COUSIN CONVEYING TO HIM THE GLAD NEWS OF THE PRINCE'S MISFORTUNE AND HE WHEN HE READ THE LETTER REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND THOUGHT TO MARRY THE PRINCESS AND ANSWERED THE MINISTER SENDING HIM RICH PRESENTS AND GREAT STORE OF TREASURE AND THANKING HIM EXCEEDINGLY

AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRY-MAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED

BUT I HAVE LEFT THE TEXT AS IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE WRITER'S INCONSEQUENCE
I ABODE THUS A GREAT WHILE KILLING ALL THE LIVE FOLK THEY LET DOWN INTO THE CAVERN AND TAKING THEIR PROVISIONS OF MEAT AND DRINK

NOR DID HE STINT TAKING OUT DISHES FROM SADDLE BAGS TILL HE HAD BROUGHT FORTH THE WHOLE OF THE FOUR AND TWENTY KINDS HE HAD NAMED WHILST JUDAR LOOKED ON
TILL HE LAID HOLD OF HER MOUTH WITH HIS HAND AND SHE BIT IT
WHEN HE SAW THIS HE SIGNED TO ME TO GIVE HIM THE GOURD THAT HE MIGHT DRINK AND I FEARED HIM AND GAVE IT HIM
WELL DONE
WHEN HE SEETH HER HE WILL ASSUREDLY FALL IN LOVE WITH HER AND WHEN WE KNOW THIS I WILL TURN TO HIM AND TELL HIM THAT SHE IS THY DAUGHTER AND ENGAGE HIM IN CONVERSE AND LEAD HIM ON SO THAT THOU SHALT SEEM TO KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER TILL HE ASK HER TO THEE TO WIFE

WE SET OUT AND VOYAGED FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND TILL WE HAD CROSSED THE SEA AND LANDED ON THE SHORES OF THE PERSIAN GULF WHEN THE MERCHANTS BROUGHT OUT AND SOLD THEIR STORES
AL-DAMIGH REJOICED IN GHARIB HIS BROTHER'S SON AND PRESENTLY TURNING TO HIM SAID I ALSO HAVE YEARNED TO TAKE BLOOD-REVENGE FOR THY FATHER BUT COULD NOT AVAIL AGAINST THE DOG THY BROTHER

ALL LIVING THINGS WERE MADE OF A LITTLE DROP OF SPERM THINE ORIGIN IS MINE AND MY PROVENANCE IS THINE
AND ABD AL-SAMAD ANSWERED I SAW TEN MAIDENS AS THEY WERE HOURIS OF HEAVEN CALLING TO ME WITH THEIR HANDS"--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY

PARDON O PROPHET OF ALLAH
HAPLY HE WILL DELIVER THEE FROM ME THINE ENEMY SO THE KING'S SON RAISED HIS EYES TO HEAVEN AND BEGAN TO PRAY WITH HIS WHOLE HEART SAYING O MY GOD I IMPLORE THY SUCCOUR AGAINST THAT WHICH TROUBLETH ME THEN HE POINTED TO HER WITH HIS HAND AND SHE FELL TO THE GROUND BURNT BLACK AS CHARCOAL
THEN JUDAR SAT WATCHING AND AFTER AWHILE HIS FEET APPEARED ABOVE THE WATER AND THE FISHER SAID HE IS DEAD AND DAMNED
SO THEY ATE TILL THEY WERE SATISFIED FOR THEY WERE WEAK WITH HUNGER
THIS WAS NOTICED BY MARCO POLO III
ALL RESPECTING SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAS AN ESPECIAL INTEREST
HE FOUND HIM A MAN OF DIGNIFIED ASPECT SURROUNDED BY PAGES EUNUCHS AND ATTENDANTS

A LIZARD FEM ALSO A WOODEN LOCK THE ONLY ONE USED THROUGHOUT EGYPT
BUT THE TALE DOES NOT SEEM TO JUSTIFY HIS EXPLANATIONS
AND THE CHIEF SAID HE MAY SAY TO THEE PLUCK OUT THINE EYE AND I WILL PLUCK OUT ONE OF MINE
THEN THE MOOR TOOK THE TWO CASKETS AND CONJURED OVER THEM BOTH WHEREUPON THERE CAME FROM WITHIN VOICES THAT SAID ADSUMUS AT THY SERVICE O DIVINER OF THE WORLD
AND PREPARE THEE GOOD PROVISION SOME DAY MAY SERVE THY TURN FOR EACH DWELLER IN THE HOUSE NEEDS MUST YEDE WI THOSE WHO YODE CONSIDER HOW THIS PEOPLE THEIR PALACES ADORNED AND IN DUST HAVE BEEN PLEDGED FOR THE SEED OF ACTS THEY SOWED THEY BUILT BUT THEIR BUILDING AVAILED THEM NOT AND HOARDS NOR SAVED THEIR LIVES NOR DAY OF DESTINY FORSLOWED
AND HE ANSWERED YES O MY LADY HE SAID UNDER YONDER TREE IS MEAT
AND THE BROADEST AND LARGEST I BOUND ACROSS MY HEAD AND MADE THEM FAST WITH ROPES
THEN HE CARRIED HIM TO HIS COMPANY WHICH WAS IN HIS DOMICILE AND THE YOUTH FOUND A HOUSE LOFTY AND SPACIOUS AND STRONGLY BUILDED WHEREIN WERE SITTING-CHAMBERS FACING ONE ANOTHER
SO SHE SAID TO HIM YAUH
WHEREFORE FRIENDSHIP AND FAMILIARITY WAXED GREAT BETWEEN THEM AND THEY ABODE THUS AWHILE TILL ONE DAY THE KING BEING ALONE WITH HIS MINISTER SAID TO HIM O WAZIR I FEAR LEST JUDAR SLAY ME AND TAKE THE KINGDOM AWAY FROM ME REPLIED THE WAZIR O KING OF THE AGE AS FOR HIS TAKING THE KINGDOM FROM THEE HAVE NO FEAR OF THAT FOR JUDAR'S PRESENT ESTATE IS GREATER THAN THAT OF THE KING AND TO TAKE THE KINGDOM WOULD BE A LOWERING OF HIS DIGNITY
FN#203 THE INK-CASE WOULD CONTAIN THE PENS
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-EIGHTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE YOUNG MAN WHEN HE HAD SQUANDERED ALL THE MONEY HIS FATHER HAD LEFT HIM AND NAUGHT THEREOF REMAINED TO HIM BETOOK HIMSELF TO SELLING HIS SLAVES AND HANDMAIDS LANDS AND HOUSES AND SPENT THE PROCEEDS ON LIKE WISE TILL HE WAS REDUCED TO BEGGARY AND MUST NEEDS LABOUR FOR HIS LIVING
ONE DAY THE YOUTH QUARRELLED WITH ANOTHER MAN WHO LODGED A COMPLAINT AGAINST HIM WITH THE CHIEF OF POLICE AND HE CAST HIM INTO PRISON
SO THEY DISMOUNTED DOWN AND SOUGHT FOR AN ENTRANCE BUT SAW NONE NEITHER FOUND ANY TRACE OF OPENING IN THE WALLS ALBEIT THERE WERE FIVE-AND-TWENTY PORTALS TO THE CITY BUT NONE OF THEM WAS VISIBLE FROM WITHOUT
AND ITS STREAMS WERE A-FLOWING AND FLOWERS A-BLOWING AND FRUITS A GLOWING
SO THE LADY'S PROCEEDING WAS NOT LIKELY TO BREED SUSPICION
AS FOR THE KOHL PHIAL WHOSO PENCILLETH HIS EYES THEREFROM HE SHALL ESPY ALL THE TREASURES OF THE EARTH
WHEREUPON HE WENT AWAY SORE CONCERNED FOR WHAT HAD BETIDED HIM AND KNOWING NOT HOW HE SHOULD DO AND SAT DOWN IN A SOLITARY PLACE HEART-HEAVY CARE FULL THOUGHT-OPPREST
BUT THE FIFTH WAZIR CAME IN TO HIM AND KISSING THE GROUND BEFORE HIM SAID O MIGHTY KING DELAY AND HASTEN NOT TO SLAY THY SON
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FIRST NIGHT SHE CONTINUED IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN SAID:--WHEN THEY ASKED ME OF MY COUNTRY I QUESTIONED THEM OF THEIRS AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE OF VARIOUS CASTES SOME BEING CALLED SHAKIRIYAH[FN#14 WHO ARE THE NOBLEST OF THEIR CASTES AND NEITHER OPPRESS NOR OFFER VIOLENCE TO ANY AND OTHERS BRAHMANS A FOLK WHO ABSTAIN FROM WINE BUT LIVE IN DELIGHT AND SOLACE AND MERRIMENT AND OWN CAMELS AND HORSES AND CATTLE

BUT IF NOT IT WILL AVAIL THEE NOTHING TO FORTIFY THYSELF IN THIS ISLAND FOR ALLAH EXTOLLED AND EXALTED BE HE HATH BIDDEN THE WIND OBEY ME
I NEVER SAW A CRESCENT-SHAPED HEAD AS THE TEXT SUGGESTS
AS SOON AS WE WERE CERTIFIED THAT HE WAS GONE WE BEGAN TO TALK WITH ONE ANOTHER WEEPING AND BEMOANING OURSELVES FOR THE RISK WE RAN AND SAYING WOULD HEAVEN WE HAD BEEN DROWNED IN THE SEA OR THAT THE APES HAD EATEN US
WHEN HE SAW HER HE PICKED UP THE REPLY AND AFTER READING IT CAME UNDER THE WINDOW AND SAID TO HER LET ME DOWN A THREAD THAT I MAY SEND THEE THIS KEY

THE TEXT EMBROIDERS THE KORANIC CHAPTER NO
WHERE IT IS TOLD WITH ALL MANNER OF PERSIAN EMBELLISHMENTS
THEN SAID GHARIB O UNCLE THOU MADEST ME A PROMISE
HE WAS WEALTHY AS HE WAS POWERFUL BUT HE HAD GROWN OLD WITHOUT BEING BLESSED WITH A SON AND THIS CAUSED HIM SORE AFFLICTION
ETC HAVE BEEN FAMOUS
THEN THE CHIEF OF POLICE LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND SAID WHAT MEANS THIS NASTINESS AND THE WAZIR ANSWERED SAYING ALLAH INCREASE THY REWARD O WALI WHEREUPON HE KNEW HIM TO BE THE MINISTER
SHE WORE A TIGHT-FITTING BODY-ROBE OF FINE PEARLS WITH A CROWN OF RED GOLD ON HER HEAD FILLETED WITH GEMS AND ON HER FOREHEAD WERE TWO GREAT JEWELS WHOSE LIGHT WAS AS THE LIGHT OF THE SUN
NOW WHEN SHE CAME BEFORE HIM HE LOOKED ON HER AND KNEW HER AND ASKED HER O ACCURSED WHERE ARE THE TWO SLAVES I SENT WITH THEE
SO HE BOUGHT HIM AND CARRYING HIM HOME SAID TO HIS WIFE TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM THE LAD ABODE THERE FOR A WHILE TILL ONE DAY THE MAN SAID TO HIS WIFE GO FORTH TO-MORROW TO THE GARDEN AND TAKE THY SOLACE THEREIN AND AMUSE THYSELF AND ENJOY THYSELF AND SHE REPLIED WITH LOVE AND GLADNESS NOW WHEN THE PAGE HEARD THIS HE MADE READY IN SECRET MEAT AND DRINK AND FRUITS AND DESERT AND SALLIED FORTH WITH THEM PRIVILY THAT NIGHT TO THE GARDEN WHERE HE LAID THE MEAT UNDER ONE TREE THE WINE UNDER ANOTHER AND THE FRUIT AND CONSERVES UNDER A THIRD IN THE WAY HIS MISTRESS MUST PASS
NOW ALL THIS BEFEL BY THE CONTRIVANCE OF THE WAZIR WHO TRAVELLED WITH HIM TO THE END THAT HE MIGHT CAUSE HIM TO PERISH ON THE WAY
FOR WE MEAN THIS STRANGER TO SELL THEM
280 THE SAME FEAT HAD BEEN CREDITED TO THOMAS EGERTON LORD CHANCELLOR IN A.D
AND VERILY I FEAR LEST THE EMIR FALL INTO DIFFICULTY FOR JUDAR
NEXT MORNING THE TWO HOSTS MOUNTED AND SOUGHT THE PLAIN WHERE CUT AND THRUST RULED SOVEREIGN
AND HE CONTINUED RIDING THROUGH THE STREETS TILL HE CAME TO A CERTAIN DOOR AT WHICH HE KNOCKED WHEREUPON IT OPENED AND OUT CAME A GIRL LIKE THE MOON TO WHOM SAID HE O MY DAUGHTER O RAHMAH,[FN#275 OPEN US THE UPPER CHAMBER ON MY HEAD AND EYES O MY PAPA REPLIED SHE AND WENT IN SWAYING HER HIPS TO AND FRO WITH A GRACEFUL AND SWIMMING GAIT LIKE A THIRSTING GAZELLE MOVEMENTS THAT RAVISHED JUDAR'S REASON AND HE SAID THIS IS NONE OTHER THAN A KING'S DAUGHTER SO SHE OPENED THE UPPER CHAMBER AND THE MOOR TAKING THE SADDLE BAGS FROM THE MULE'S BACK SAID GO AND GOD BLESS THEE WHEN LO

HE IS NOW GONE TO BEAR THE PRINCESS OF PERSIA WHOM HE DELIVERED FROM THE GHUL BACK TO HER FATHER KING SABUR AND WILL NOT RETURN BUT WITH THE TREASURES OF THE PERSIANS WHEN AJIB HEARD THE STORY OF MARDAS HE CHANGED COLOUR TO YELLOW AND WAS IN ILL CASE AND MADE SURE OF HIS OWN DESTRUCTION

THEN SAID SHE TO HIM VERILY O KING THOU DOST US HIGH HONOUR AND IF WE BROUGHT THEE TO GIFT THE WORLD AND ALL THAT THEREIN IS IT WOULD NOT BE WORTH A SINGLE ONE OF THY STEPS US-WARDS."--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY

GO TO SUCH AND SUCH A GATE WHEREBY LIVES A BLIND SHAYKH A CRIPPLE WHO IS KNOWING WISE AS A WIZARD AND EXPERIENCED
SO HE KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE JUDAR AND CALLED DOWN BLESSINGS ON HIM

SHE WENT UP TO HIM AND SALUTING HIM ASKED HAST THOU A MIND TO MEAT AND DRINK AND A GIRL ADORNED AND READY ANSWERED HE WHERE IS THIS TO BE HAD AT HOME IN MY HOUSE REJOINED SHE AND CARRYING HIM TO HIS OWN HOUSE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
THEN THE CAPTAIN TURNED TO ME AND SAID HARK'EE THOU ART A STRANGER AND A PAUPER AND TELLEST US THAT THOU HAST UNDERGONE FRIGHTFUL HARDSHIP

WHERETO HE ANSWERED ME I AM MINDED THAT THOU TRAVEL TO THE KING OF SARANDIB AND CARRY TO HIM OUR WRIT AND OUR GIFT FOR THAT HE HATH SENT TO US A PRESENT AND A LETTER

HOW MUCH HAVE I WITNESSED OF BLESSING AND BANE
AND WITH A FAVOURING BREEZE AND THE BEST CONDITIONS WE SAILED FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND AND SEA TO SEA TILL ONE DAY THERE AROSE AGAINST US A CONTRARY WIND AND THE CAPTAIN CAST OUT HIS ANCHORS AND BROUGHT THE SHIP TO A STANDSILL FEARING LEST SHE SHOULD FOUNDER IN MID-OCEAN

SO I TOOK A PIECE OF A WHITE SHROUD I HAD WITH ME AND TYING IT TO A STAFF RAN ALONG THE SEA-SHORE MAKING SIGNALS THEREWITH AND CALLING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE SHIP TILL THEY ESPIED ME AND HEARING MY SHOUTS SENT A BOAT TO FETCH ME OFF
NAY SHE IS BUT AN ENCHANTMENT IN HER SEMBLANCE WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO FIND THEE DEFAULTING
AND FOR AN INSTANCE OF THE MALICE OF THE MALE SEX CONTINUED THE DAMSEL I HAVE HEARD O KING TELL THIS TALE OF THE TWO PIGEONS.[FN#219 A PAIR OF PIGEONS ONCE STORED UP WHEAT AND BARLEY IN THEIR NEST DURING THE WINTER AND WHEN THE SUMMER CAME THE GRAIN SHRIVELLED AND BECAME LESS

SO HE DREW NEAR THEM AND FINDING INSCRIPTIONS GRAVEN THEREON CALLED THE SHAYKH AND BADE HIM READ THESE
SO GUARD YE MARDAS AND HIS TRIBESMEN TILL I CARRY THEM AWAY AND DO THEM DIE WITH THE FOULEST OF DEATHS WHEN MARDAS SAW HIMSELF A PRISONER HE REPENTED OF WHAT HE HAD DONE AND SAID THIS IS THE REWARD OF REBELLING AGAINST THE LORD THEN THE ENEMY PASSED THE NIGHT REJOICING IN THEIR VICTORY WHILST MARDAS AND HIS MEN DESPAIRED OF LIFE AND MADE SURE OF DOOM
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED ANTE SEVENTY-FIFTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE EMIR WEPT TILL HE WAS LIKE TO SWOON AWAY AND BADE WRITE DOWN THE VERSES AFTER WHICH HE PASSED ON INTO THE INNER PALACE AND CAME TO A VAST HALL AT EACH OF WHOSE FOUR CORNERS STOOD A PAVILION LOFTY AND SPACIOUS WASHED WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND PAINTED IN VARIOUS COLOURS

I HID MYSELF IN THE TREE BEING IN SORE TERROR AND TREMBLED TILL THE SUN AROSE
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FIRST NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED AS FOLLOWS:--AND WHEN THE SHIP FOUNDERED I SCRAMBLED ON TO A PLANK WITH SOME OTHERS OF THE MERCHANTS AND MOUNTING IT AS WE WOULD A HORSE PADDLED WITH OUR FEET IN THE SEA
FN#279 THESE RETORTS OF JUDAR ARE EXACTLY WHAT A SHARP EGYPTIAN FELLAH WOULD SAY ON SUCH OCCASIONS
WHEREUPON JUDAR WEPT AND TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM
SO HE COMMITTED HIS AFFAIR TO ALMIGHTY ALLAH
AND OVER THE DOORWAY WAS A TABLET WHEREON WERE GRAVEN LETTERS OF GOLD IN THE OLD ANCIENT IONIAN CHARACTER
WITH THIS THE CAPTAIN CAME DOWN FROM THE MAST SAYING THERE IS NO MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT
HERE HE SOUGHT OUT THE GARDENER AND SAID TO HIM I AM A STRANGER FROM A FAR COUNTRY AND FROM MY YOUTH UPWARDS I HAVE BEEN A GARDENER AND IN THE GRAFTING OF TREES AND THE CULTURE OF FRUITS AND FLOWERS AND CARE OF THE VINE NONE IS MORE SKILLED THAN I WHEN THE GARDENER HEARD THIS HE REJOICED IN HIM WITH EXCEEDING JOY AND CARRIED HIM INTO THE GARDEN WHERE HE COMMENDED HIM TO HIS UNDERLINGS AND THE PRINCE BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE SERVICE OF THE GARDEN AND THE TENDING OF THE TREES AND THE BETTERING OF THEIR FRUITS AND IMPROVING THE PERSIAN WATER-WHEELS AND DISPOSING THE IRRIGATION-CHANNELS
MOREOVER A PRETTY WOMAN WHEN SHE WISHES WILL ALWAYS LET YOU SEE SOMETHING UNDER THE VEIL
BUT ON THE SIXTH DAY THE FAVOURITE CAME IN TO HIM HENDING A NAKED KNIFE IN HAND AND SAID TO HIM KNOW O MY LORD THAT EXCEPT THOU HEARKEN TO MY COMPLAINT AND PROTECT THY RIGHT AND THINE HONOUR AGAINST THESE THY MINISTERS WHO ARE BANDED TOGETHER AGAINST ME TO DO ME WRONG I WILL KILL MYSELF WITH THIS KNIFE AND MY BLOOD WILL TESTIFY AGAINST THEE ON THE DAY OF DOOM
BUT KNOW O EMIR THAT THE ROAD THITHER IS LONG AND DIFFICULT AND THE WAYS FEW HOW FAR IS IT ASKED MUSA AND THE SHAYKH ANSWERED IT IS A JOURNEY OF TWO YEARS AND SOME MONTHS GOING AND THE LIKE RETURNING
WHEREUPON BOTH HE AND THE MERCHANTS WERE CERTIFIED AT THE TRUTH OF MY STORY AND RECOGNIZED ME AND GAVE ME JOY OF MY DELIVERANCE SAYING BY ALLAH WE THOUGHT NOT THAT THOU HADST ESCAPED DROWNING
THE WHITE HAND AND BLACK HAND HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED
AND HE BROUGHT OUT DISHES OF MEAT FROM THE SADDLE BAGS AND THEY ATE THE UNDURN MEAL
THE LORD WILL SURELY GIVE THEE A BETTER IN HER STEAD AND THY NAME SHALL BE GREAT AND THY LIFE SHALL BE LONG IN THE LAND INSHALLAH!"[FN#47 BUT HE WEPT BITTER TEARS AND REPLIED O MY FRIEND HOW CAN I MARRY ANOTHER WIFE AND HOW SHALL ALLAH REPLACE HER TO ME WITH A BETTER THAN SHE WHENAS I HAVE BUT ONE DAY LEFT TO LIVE O MY BROTHER SAID I RETURN TO THY SENSES AND ANNOUNCE NOT THE GLAD TIDINGS OF THINE OWN DEATH FOR THOU ART WELL SOUND AND IN GOOD CASE BY THY LIFE O MY FRIEND REJOINED HE TO-MORROW THOU WILT LOSE ME AND WILT NEVER SEE ME AGAIN TILL THE DAY OF RESURRECTION I ASKED HOW SO AND HE ANSWERED THIS VERY DAY THEY BURY MY WIFE AND THEY BURY ME WITH HER IN ONE TOMB

ARABIC HAS NO EQUIVALENT OF OUR THANK YOU KASSARA LLAH KHAYR-AK BEING A MERE BLESSING ALLAH INCREASE THY WEAL NOR CAN AL-LSLAM EXPRESS GRATITUDE SAVE BY A PERIPHRASE

WHEN HIS SIRE GOT THE LETTER HE WAS SORE CONCERNED FOR HIS SON AND WOULD HAVE SUCCOURED HIM BY SENDING TROOPS AND SOLDIERS
WHERETO I ANSWERED YES O MY MASTER SO WE MOUNTED AN ELEPHANT AND FARED UNTIL WE CAME TO THE SPOT AND WHEN MY MASTER BEHELD THE HEAPS OF TUSKS HE REJOICED GREATLY

WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY-NINTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED:--AND WHEN WE HAD CAST ANCHOR THE MERCHANTS AND THE SAILORS LANDED WITH THEIR GOODS TO SELL AND TO BUY
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FIFTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED HIS RELATION OF WHAT BEFEL HIM IN THE MOUNTAIN OF DIAMONDS AND INFORMED THEM THAT THE MERCHANTS CANNOT COME AT THE DIAMONDS SAVE BY THE DEVICE AFORESAID

PRESENTLY WE DREW NEAR TO LAND AND I SAW THE SHORE FULL OF TROOPS NONE KNOWETH THEIR NUMBER SAVE ALLAH EXTOLLED AND EXALTED BE HE AND ALL WERE MAGNIFICENTLY ARRAYED AND CLAD IN COMPLETE STEEL
SO SHE BUSSED GROUND BEFORE HIM AND TAKING HIS HAND BROUGHT HIM INTO THE SALOON WHERE SHE MADE HIM SIT DOWN AND SAID TO HIM O MY LORD THIS HOUSE IS THY HOUSE
HIS IDEA WAS TO PUT THE HIGHEST RACES OF APES TO THE LOWEST OF HUMANITY
AND AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRUNKEN HE WENT IN UNTO HIS BRIDE AND FOUND HER A MAID VIRGINAL
I WILL GO FORTH TO HIM SO HE DONNED HIS BATTLE-GEAR AND DRIVING HIS CHARGER INTO MID-FIELD WHERE HE FRONTED THE FOE AND CRIED OUT TO GHARIB SAYING FIE ON THEE O DOG OF THE ARABS
MOREOVER THE MERCHANTS INSTALLED ME IN HIS OFFICE FOR HE WAS THEIR SHAYKH AND THEIR CHIEF

HE BADE THEM BRING HIM IN AND THEY DID SO WHEREUPON HE KISSED GROUND BEFORE GHARIB AND WISHED HIM HONOUR AND LENGTH OF DAYS
BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE TOP OF THE WALL HE STOOD UP AND GAZED FIXEDLY DOWN INTO THE CITY THEN CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND CRYING OUT AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE BY ALLAH THOU ART FAIR CAST HIMSELF DOWN INTO THE PLACE AND MUSA CRIED BY ALLAH HE IS A DEAD MAN BUT ANOTHER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID O EMIR THIS WAS A MADMAN AND DOUBTLESS HIS MADNESS GOT THE BETTER OF HIM AND DESTROYED HIM

IN THE EVENING I REPORTED MY SUCCESS TO MY MASTER WHO WAS DELIGHTED IN ME AND ENTREATED ME WITH HIGH HONOUR
FOR HE IS ALLAH THE ONE THE ALL POWERFUL LORD WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THEIR BOSOMS BROADENED TO THE WORDS OF UNITY-FAITH AND THEY SAID VERILY THIS BE A LORD HIGH AND GREAT COMPASSIONATING AND COMPASSIONATE

THEN CAME TO THEM A CRIER AFTER BURIAL AND CRIED WHAT BOOTED THRONES OR CROWNS OR THE GOLD TO YOU BESTOWED
AFTER WHICH QUOTH GHARIB HARKYE SA'ADAN

WHEREUPON ALMOST BEFORE THEY HAD DONE DOWN CAME THE KING OF THE BLACKS FROM THE MOUNTAIN AND DREW NEAR THE CAMP

THEN GHARIB CHARGED AND WHEELED AND CALLED FOR CHAMPIONS
AND THE REQUIRED IS PRODUCED BY THE CHARM SHE THEN TOLD HER SONS THEIR VIRTUE ENJOINING THEM TO SECRECY
DEATH FOLLOWED HARD UPON THE TRAIL OF THEM ALL AND LAID THEM LOW SPARING NEITHER GREAT NOR SMALL MALE NOR FEMALE

FOR LYING AND LEASING ARE THE LETTER-MARKS OF THE HYPOCRITES THEN I RECOUNTED TO HIM ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN ME SINCE I SAILED FROM BAGHDAD WITH HIM TO THE TIME WHEN WE CAME TO THE FISH-ISLAND WHERE WE WERE NEARLY DROWNED

SO HE SAID TO HER GO INTO THE HOUSE TILL I BRING HIM BEFORE ME
AND AL-GHAZáLí SEES IN HIS CLAIM THE MOST NOBLE ASPIRATION TO THE DIVINE INNATE IN THE HUMAN SPIRIT
FOR WHENAS I SEE THE YOUTH PERFECT IN ALL SCIENCE I WILL SHARE MY DIGNITY WITH THE PRINCE AND MAKE HIM PARTNER WITH ME IN MY POSSESSIONS KNOW O KING THEY REPLIED THAT AMONG US NONE IS MORE LEARNED OR MORE EXCELLENT THAN AL-SINDIBAD,[FN#155 HIGHT THE SAGE WHO WONETH IN THY CAPITAL UNDER THY PROTECTION

AND SUMMONING THE CHIEF OF THE COURIERS SAID TO HIM WEND THOU FORTHRIGHT TO THE MONASTERY SO HE LOST NO TIME AND WHEN HE REACHED IT HE ASKED THE MONKS OF THE KING'S DAUGHTER BUT THEY SAID WE HAVE NOT SEEN HER THIS YEAR SO THE COURIER RETURNED TO THE CITY OF ISBáNíR[FN#346 AND TOLD THE WAZIR WHO WENT IN TO THE KING AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THE MESSAGE

ONE DAY AS I SAT AT HOME THERE CAME A KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND WHEN THE PORTER OPENED A PAGE ENTERED AND SAID THE CALIPH BIDDETH THEE TO HIM I WENT WITH HIM TO THE KING'S MAJESTY AND KISSED GROUND AND SALUTED HIM
FOR AFTER COITION I TOOK FROM EACH A SEAL RING AND LAID IT IN THIS KERCHIEF THEN SHE ADDED AND NOW GO THY WAYS THAT I MAY LOOK FOR ANOTHER THAN THYSELF FOR THE IFRIT WILL NOT AWAKE YET AWHILE HARDLY CREDITING WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE PRINCE RETURNED TO HIS FATHER'S PALACE BUT THE KING KNEW NAUGHT OF THE DAMSEL'S MALICE FOR SHE FEARED NOT THIS AND TOOK NO COUNT THEREOF AND SEEING THAT HIS SON HAD LOST HIS RING HE BADE PUT HIM TO DEATH.[FN#240 THEN HE ROSE FROM HIS PLACE AND ENTERED HIS PALACE
FN#199 ARAB
THEN HE MOUNTED AND REJOICED GREATLY IN THE SADDLE AND REWARDED ME HANDSOMELY FOR MY WORK

FN#124 THIS FORMULA ACCORDING TO MOSLEMS WOULD BEGIN WITH THE BEGINNING THERE IS NO ILáH BUT ALLAH AND ADAM IS THE APOSTLE RASúL = ONE SENT A MESSENGER NOT NABí = PROPHET OF ALLAH AND SO ON WITH NOAH MOSES DAVID NOT SOLOMON AS A RULE AND JESUS TO MOHAMMED
BUT THE EMIR REJOINED SAYING FEAR NOT
OR I WILL DO THEE DIE THEREWITH GHARIB CRAVE AT HIM AND THERE BEFEL BETWEEN THEM A BATTLE SUCH AS WOULD MAKE A NEW-BORN CHILD TURN GREY AND MELT THE FLINTY ROCK WITH ITS SORE AFFRAY
THE YOUTH'S MASTER KNOCKED AT THE DOOR

VII CALL THE PHARAOH OF MOSES AL-WALID AND DERIVE HIM FROM THE AMALEKITES
FN#207 THIS STORY APPEARS FAMILIAR BUT I HAVE NOT FOUND IT EASY TO TRACE
SO HE ROSE UP AND REPAIRED TO THE PART WHITHER THE DEAD MAN HAD POINTED AND SOUGHT TILL IN A DARK UNFREQUENTED CORNER HE FOUND A LITTLE DOOR OVER WHICH THE SPIDER HAD SPUN HER WEBS AND WHICH WAS FASTENED WITH FOUR PADLOCKS OF STEEL
BUT NONE THEREOF MAY BE OPENED SAVE FROM WITHIN THE CITY ASKED MUSA AND HOW SHALL WE DO TO ENTER THE CITY AND VIEW ITS WONDERS AND TALIB SON OF SAHL HIS WAZIR ANSWERED ALLAH ASSAIN THE EMIR
AFTER WHICH HE GAVE THEM IN CHARGE TO VALIANT KNIGHTS OF THE ARABS FOR TRAINING THEM TO SMITE WITH SWORD AND LUNGE WITH LANCE AND SHOOT WITH SHAFT

BUT AS FOR HIS BROTHERS THEY PLIED NO CRAFT AND NEITHER SOLD NOR BOUGHT
KNOWEST THOU NOT THAT THE CUP OF DEATH IS FILLED FOR THY BANE WHICH IN A LITTLE WHILE TO THE DREGS THOU SHALT DRAIN
MY WIFE CAME TO MEET ME AND SALUTING ME GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFETY AND THEN SAID BEWARE OF GOING FORTH HEREAFTER WITH YONDER FOLK NEITHER CONSORT WITH THEM FOR THEY ARE BRETHREN OF THE DEVILS AND KNOW NOT HOW TO MENTION THE NAME OF ALLAH ALMIGHTY
TILL AT LAST FINDING NO WAY OF ACCESS TO HIS WIFE AND BEING DISTRAUGHT WITH RAGE AND JEALOUSY TO HEAR HER SIGHING AND MURMURING AND BREATHING HARD UNDER THE YOUNG MAN HE WENT UP TO THE TOP OF THE BATH AND CASTING HIMSELF DOWN THEREFROM DIED
SO ALL THE KINGS SONS SOUGHT HER TO WIFE
WHEREUPON AL-RA'AD CAME TO JUDAR AND SAID TO HIM O MY LORD THE PALACE IS FINISHED AND IN BEST ORDER AN IT PLEASE THEE TO COME AND LOOK ON IT SO JUDAR WENT FORTH WITH HIS MOTHER AND BROTHERS AND SAW A PALACE WHOSE LIKE THERE WAS NOT IN THE WHOLE WORLD
WHAT AILS THY MISTRESS TO LIE THERE WEEPING ANSWERED THE PAGE O MY LORD SHE FELL OFF THE TREE AND WAS KILLED;[FN#209 AND NONE BUT ALLAH BE HE EXTOLLED AND EXALTED RESTORED HER TO THEE
THEREUPON THE SAGE TAKING THE PRINCE'S HAND LED HIM TO HIS PLACE AND THE KING SENT THEM ALL REQUISITES OF PROVAUNT AND KITCHEN-BATTERIES CARPETS AND OTHER FURNITURE

THE FIVE DAILY PRAYERS MADE ALL MOSLEMS TAKE STRICT ACCOUNT OF TIME AND THEIR NOMENCLATURE OF ITS DIVISION IS EXTENSIVE
WHEN THE WAZIR'S WIFE SAW HIM SHE KNEW HIM AND SPRINGING UP KISSED HIS HANDS AND FEET AND WELCOMED HIM
I HAVE NO READY MONEY
HE REARED THEM ALL TILL THEY CAME TO MAN'S ESTATE BUT THE YOUNGEST HE LOVED MORE THAN HIS BROTHERS WHO SEEING THIS WAXED JEALOUS OF JUDAR AND HATED HIM
AND MAKING TOWARDS HIM WHO WAS THE PRINCE FOUND HIM A VERY OLD MAN WHOSE HANDS AND FEET TREMBLED FOR DECREPITUDE AND BEFORE HIM STORE OF PRECIOUS JEWELS AND ROYAL ORNAMENTS
AND THIS SON SAID TO HIM ONE DAY O MY FATHER I HAVE A MIND TO FARE A-COURSING AND A-HUNTING SO THE KING BADE FURNISH HIM AND COMMANDED ONE OF HIS WAZIRS TO BEAR HIM COMPANY AND DO ALL THE SERVICE HE NEEDED DURING HIS TRIP
NOW WE HAD PICKED UP ON THE BEACH SOME SMALL MATTER OF VICTUAL FROM THE WRECK AND HUSBANDED IT CAREFULLY EATING BUT ONCE EVERY DAY OR TWO IN OUR FEAR LEST IT SHOULD FAIL US AND WE DIE MISERABLY OF FAMINE OR AFFRIGHT

THENCE THEY PASSED TO THE THIRD PAVILION WHEREIN THEY SAW CLOSETS PADLOCKED AND COVERED WITH CURTAINS WROUGHT WITH ALL MANNER OF EMBROIDERY

SO PRAISED BE ALLAH FOR THY SAFETY THEN THEY SET SOMEWHAT OF FOOD BEFORE ME WHEREOF I ATE MY FILL AND GAVE ME SOMEWHAT OF CLOTHES WHEREWITH I CLAD MYSELF ANEW AND COVERED MY NAKEDNESS

WHICH DO THOU TAKE AND KEEP BY THEE SO SHE LET DOWN A THREAD AND HE TIED THE KEY TO IT.[FN#205 THEN HE WENT AWAY AND REPAIRING TO ONE OF HIS FATHER'S WAZIRS COMPLAINED TO HIM OF HIS PASSION FOR THE LADY AND THAT HE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT HER
PRESENTLY AS HE WAS PASSING THE GATE OF A MERCHANT'S HOUSE BEFORE WHICH THE GROUND WAS SWEPT AND WATERED AND THERE THE AIR WAS TEMPERATE HE SIGHTED A BROAD BENCH BESIDE THE DOOR
SO THEY ASKED AND WHAT HATH HIS GOVERNOR AL-SINDIBAD BEEN DOING AND WHEN THE KING ANSWERED HE HATH TAUGHT MY SON NAUGHT THE OLEMA AND PHILOSOPHERS AND HIGH OFFICERS SUMMONED THE INSTRUCTOR AND SAID TO HIM O SAGE WHAT PREVENTED THEE FROM TEACHING THE KING'S SON DURING THIS LENGTH OF DAYS O WISE MEN HE REPLIED THE PRINCE'S MIND IS WHOLLY OCCUPIED WITH DISPORT AND PLAY
THEN WE TALKED TOGETHER TILL THE OTHER MERCHANTS HEARING ME IN DISCOURSE WITH THEIR FELLOW CAME UP AND SALUTED ME

AND IT WAS ON THIS WISE

AND AS THEY WENT ABOUT THE HIGHWAYS AND BYEWAYS OF THE PALACE VIEWING ITS SITTING-CHAMBERS AND PLEASAUNCES BEHOLD THEY CAME UPON A TABLE OF YELLOW ONYX UPBORNE ON FOUR FEET OF JUNIPER-WOOD,[FN#121 AND THERE-ON THESE WORDS GRAVEN AT THIS TABLE HAVE EATEN A THOUSAND KINGS BLIND OF THE RIGHT EYE AND A THOUSAND BLIND OF THE LEFT AND YET OTHER THOUSAND SOUND OF BOTH EYES ALL OF WHOM HAVE DEPARTED THE WORLD AND HAVE TAKEN UP THEIR SOJOURN IN THE TOMBS AND THE CATACOMBS ALL THIS THE EMIR WROTE DOWN AND LEFT THE PALACE CARRYING OFF WITH HIM NAUGHT SAVE THE TABLE AFORESAID
AND THUS SHE DID DAY BY DAY TILL THE BITCH BECAME FOND OF HER AND FOLLOWED HER WHEREVER SHE WENT
SO HE RETURNED WEARY AND BROKEN-HEARTED TO THE HOUSE WHERE HE HAD DWELT WITH THE OLD MEN AND KNEW THAT THEY HAD FARED EVEN AS HE AND THAT THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR SHEDDING TEARS AND LAMENTING THEIR LOT
THEY FAILED TO WARD AND GUARD
IF THE SHAYKH FALL WE ARE DEAD MEN ONE AND ALL THEN HE LAUGHED BEYOND ALL MEASURE AND SAT A LONG HOUR RECITING THE NAMES OF ALLAH ALMIGHTY AND REPEATING THE VERSES OF SAFETY
ACCORDINGLY THEY RUSHED ON US AND WE RUSHED ON THEM EACH CRYING OUT UPON OTHER AND BATTLE REARED ITS CREST RISING IN VOLUMES AND SMOKE ASCENDING IN COLUMNS AND HEARTS WELL NIGH CLEAVING
THEN QUOTH HE TO THE EMIR ARE YE MEN OR JINN WELL WE ARE MEN QUOTH MUSA
THE DOOR OPENED AND HE ENTERED AND UNDID THE SEVERAL ENCHANTMENTS TILL HE CAME TO THE SEVENTH DOOR AND THE SEMBLANCE OF HIS MOTHER APPEARED BEFORE HIM SAYING WELCOME,[FN#280 O MY SON BUT HE SAID TO HER HOW AM I THY SON O ACCURSED
VERILY SHE HATH ENTHRALLED ME AND RAVISHED MY REASON REPLIED THE WAZIR SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF THY FRIEND THE KING
INDEED THE DWELLING-PLACES ARE VOID OF THEM AND THEY HAVE DEPARTED FROM KINDRED AND HOME
AS AN EXCLAMATION IS EQUIVALENT TO MIGHTY FINE FN#315 IN MODERN DAYS USED IN A BAD SENSE AS A FREETHINKER ETC
EVERY LIFE HATH ITS TERM APPOINTED THEN HE ALIGHTED AND GAVE THE FISHERMAN THE SILKEN CORD SAYING DO WITH ME O JUDAR AS THOU DIDST WITH THEM SAID JUDAR PUT THY HANDS BEHIND THY BACK THAT I MAY PINION THEE FOR I AM IN HASTE AND TIME FLIES SO HE PUT HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND JUDAR TIED HIM UP AND CAST HIM IN

BUT TO-MORROW I WILL GO FORTH ON CHAMPION WISE AND DEFY HIM TO COMBAT OF TWAIN IN BATTLE PLAIN WHERE EDGE AND POINT ARE FAIN AND I WILL CUT OFF THESE ARABS NOW WHEN GHARIB RETURNED TO HIS CAMP THE PRINCESS FAKHR TAJ MET HIM WEEPING AND AFFRIGHTED FOR THE TERROR OF THAT WHICH HAD BEFALLEN AND KISSED HIS FOOT IN THE STIRRUP SAYING MAY THY HANDS NEVER WITHER NOR THY FOES BE BLITHER O CHAMPION OF THE AGE
ONE OF THE SONS OF IBLIS HAD AN IDOL OF RED CARNELIAN WHEREOF I WAS GUARDIAN AND THERE SERVED IT A KING OF THE KINGS OF THE SEA A PRINCE OF PUISSANT POWER AND PROW OF PROWESS OVER-RULING A THOUSAND THOUSAND WARRIORS OF THE JANN WHO SMOTE WITH SWORDS BEFORE HIM AND ANSWERED HIS SUMMONS IN TIME OF NEED
ITS TREES IN ABUNDANCE DIGHT BORE RIPE-YELLOW FRUIT FOR FREIGHT
SHE RECOUNTED THE WHOLE STORY AND THE HUSBAND NOW BITTERLY REPENTED HAVING KILLED THE PARROT OF WHOSE INNOCENCE HE HAD PROOF
THE TWO PIGEONS U
WE CONTINUED VOYAGING AND COASTING ALONG MANY ISLANDS
WHEREUPON UP CAME THE MERCHANT WHO HAD CRIED OUT AT THE EAGLE AND SEEING ME STANDING THERE BESPOKE ME NOT BUT WAS AFFRIGHTED AT ME AND SHOOK WITH FEAR
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN THUS CONTINUED:--"ALHAMDOLILLAH QUOTH THE CAPTAIN LAUDED BE ALLAH WHO HATH RESTORED UNTO THEE THY GOODS AND GEAR THEN I DISPOSED OF MY MERCHANDISE TO THE BEST OF MY SKILL AND PROFITED LARGELY ON THEM WHEREAT I REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY AND CONGRATULATED MYSELF ON MY SAFETY AND THE RECOVERY OF MY GOODS
BUT LAUDED BE ALLAH WHO HATH BROUGHT THEE AND ME TOGETHER AGAIN AND WHO HATH RESTORED TO THEE THY GOODS AND GEAR!"--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
SO HE STOOD THERE SIGHING AND THE BAKER SAID TO HIM WELCOME TO THEE O JUDAR
HOW IS IT WITH THY LORD MY SON
FN#260 THE COIN IS OMITTED IN THE TEXT BUT IT IS EVIDENTLY THE NUSF OR HALF-DIRHAM
FURTHERMORE ALL THE GRANDEES AND OFFICERS OF STATE CAME FOR SADDLES TO ME
I WALKED ON ALONG THE MOUNTAIN-RIDGE STAYING MY STEPS WITH THE STAFF AND PONDERING THE CASE OF THE TWO YOUTHS WHEN BEHOLD A SERPENT CAME FORTH FROM UNDER THE MOUNTAIN WITH A MAN IN HER[FN#95 JAWS WHOM SHE HAD SWALLOWED EVEN TO BELOW HIS NAVEL AND HE WAS CRYING OUT AND SAYING WHOSO DELIVERETH ME ALLAH WILL DELIVER HIM FROM ALL ADVERSITY SO I WENT UP TO THE SERPENT AND SMOTE HER ON THE HEAD WITH THE GOLDEN STAFF WHEREUPON SHE CAST THE MAN FORTH OF HER MOUTH.--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
AT LAST SHE WINKED AT THE OLD WOMAN TO COME AND HOLD HER HAND FROM HIM
THEY'RE TOMBED YET PLEDGED TO ACTIONS PAST AWAY AND AFTER DEATH UPON THEM CAME DECAY
WE FARED ON FROM SEA TO SEA AND FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND AND CITY TO CITY IN ALL DELIGHT AND CONTENTMENT BUYING AND SELLING WHEREVER WE TOUCHED AND TAKING OUR SOLACE AND OUR PLEASURE TILL ONE DAY WHEN AS WE SAILED ATHWART THE DASHING SEA SWOLLEN WITH CLASHING BILLOWS BEHOLD THE MASTER WHO STOOD ON THE GUNWALE EXAMINING THE OCEAN IN ALL DIRECTIONS CRIED OUT WITH A GREAT CRY AND BUFFETED HIS FACE AND PLUCKT OUT HIS BEARD AND RENT HIS RAIMENT AND BADE FURL THE SAIL AND CAST THE ANCHORS
AND I THANKED THE LORD BE HE PRAISED AND GLORIFIED AND BLESSED HIM FOR HAVING RESTORED ME TO MY KITH AND KIN AND COUNTRY AND HOME
FN#314 THE WORD IS AS MUCH USED IN EGYPT AS WUNDERBAR IN GERMANY
EVIDENTLY FROM GREEK LETTERS = BRILLIANT THE BRILLIANT STONE
AND SOME DAYS PASSED BY WITHOUT ANY SUCH ILL CASE BEFALLING HIM IN THE HOUSE AS THE DOORKEEPER HAD MENTIONED
MOREOVER HE CHARGED HIM TO ENGAGE GUIDES AND TO SPARE NEITHER MEN NOR MONEY NOR TO BE REMISS IN THE MATTER AS HE WOULD TAKE NO EXCUSE
BUT THE CURRENT OVERPOWERED ME AND DREW IT INTO THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE LIKE AN ARCHWAY
FOR THERE IS A BLESSING UPON HIM AND HE WILL SURELY COME BACK WITH GREAT GOOD BUT SHE WEPT FOR IT WAS GRIEVOUS TO HER TO BE PARTED FROM HER SON
AND IF HE SAY THE WHILE SLAY YONDER HOST THERE WILL COME FORTH OF THAT SWORD LIGHTNING AND FIRE THAT WILL KILL THE WHOLE MANY
THEN HE WAITED AWHILE AND ATTACKED US A SECOND TIME UNTIL HE BROUGHT US TO BEGGARY
BUT NONE CAN GET TO THIS PLACE WHERE IS THE CRUDE AMBERGRIS BECAUSE OF THE MOUNTAINS WHICH ENCLOSE THE ISLAND ON ALL SIDES AND WHICH FOOT OF MAN CANNOT ASCEND.[FN#75 WE CONTINUED THUS TO EXPLORE THE ISLAND MARVELLING AT THE WONDERFUL WORKS OF ALLAH AND THE RICHES WE FOUND THERE BUT SORE TROUBLED FOR OUR OWN CASE AND DISMAYED AT OUR PROSPECTS
BUT MY ADVICE PROFITED THEE NAUGHT HOWEVER O MY DAUGHTER SEEING HER MISERY I HAD COMPASSION ON HER CASE AND KEPT HER BY ME
THEN IT COILED ABOUT THE BOLE[FN#32 WITH HIM WHILST I WHO COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE SIGHT HEARD HIS BONES CRACK IN ITS BELLY AND IT SWALLOWED HIM WHOLE AFTER WHICH IT SLID DOWN FROM THE TREE
WHEREUPON SAHIM AND SOME OF HIS MEN FELL UPON HIM AND PINIONED HIM
THE ORANGE AS IT WERE A CRESSES FLAMING LIGHT THE SHADDOCK WEIGHED DOWN WITH HEAVY FREIGHT
EACH MORN THAT DAWNS I WAKE IN TRAVAIL AND IN WOE AND STRANGE IS MY CONDITION AND MY BURDEN GARS ME PINE

AND SHE ANSWERED THEY ARE BOTH WELL QUOTH HE WHY DOST THOU BEG BY THE WAYSIDE QUOTH SHE BECAUSE I AM HUNGRY O MY SON AND HE BEFORE I WENT AWAY I GAVE THEE AN HUNDRED DINERS ONE DAY THE LIKE THE NEXT AND A THOUSAND ON THE DAY OF MY DEPARTURE O MY SON THEY CHEATED ME AND TOOK THE MONEY FROM ME SAYING WE WILL BUY GOODS WITH IT THEN THEY DROVE ME AWAY AND I FELL TO BEGGING BY THE WAYSIDE FOR STRESS OF HUNGER O MY MOTHER NO HARM SHALL BEFALL THEE NOW I AM COME
SO WHEN I SAW THE SLAUGHTERED BEAST FALL HE PURSUED AND BETHOUGHT ME OF THE STORY I WENT UP TO IT AND FILLED MY POCKETS AND SHAWL-GIRDLE AND TURBAND AND THE FOLDS OF MY CLOTHES WITH THE CHOICEST DIAMONDS
AND THE REAPER OF MANKIND CUT THEM OFF YEA BY HIM WHO MAKETH NIGHT TO RETURN UPON DAY
BUT TO-MORROW WE SHALL STAND BOTH THOU AND I BEFORE THE JUST JUDGE AND HE SHALL DO ME JUSTICE ON THEE O KING WHEN THE KING HEARD THIS HE COMMANDED TO PUT HIS SON TO DEATH
AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY THE APES LEFT THE PLACE AND ATE OF THE FRUITS OF THE GARDENS THEN WENT BACK TO THE MOUNTAINS AND SLEPT THERE TILL NIGHTFALL WHEN THEY AGAIN CAME DOWN UPON THE CITY.[FN#64 NOW THIS PLACE WAS IN THE FARTHEST PART OF THE COUNTRY OF THE BLACKS AND ONE OF THE STRANGEST THINGS THAT BEFEL ME DURING MY SOJOURN IN THE CITY WAS ON THIS WISE
SO I CLIMBED THE CLIFFS INTO THE INWARD OF THE ISLE AND WALKED ON INLAND TILL I CAME TO A STREAM OF SWEET WATER THAT WELLED UP AT THE NEAREST FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND DISAPPEARED IN THE EARTH UNDER THE RANGE OF HILLS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE

FN#265 THUS MAKING THE AGREEMENT A KIND OF RELIGIOUS COVENANT AS CATHOLICS WOULD RECITE A PATER OR AN AVE MARIA
SO HE STOOD TO SERVE HIM AND WHEN THE YOUNG MAN PUT OFF HIS CLOTHES[FN#187 HE SAW NOT HIS YARD FOR THAT IT WAS HIDDEN BETWEEN HIS THIGHS BY REASON OF THE EXCESS OF HIS FAT AND THERE APPEARED THEREOF BUT WHAT WAS LIKE UNTO A FILBERT.[FN#188 AT THIS THE BATH-KEEPER FELL A-LAMENTING AND SMITING HAND UPON HAND WHICH WHEN THE YOUTH SAW HE SAID TO HIM WHAT AILS THEE O BATH-KEEPER TO LAMENT THUS AND HE ANSWERED SAYING O MY LORD MY LAMENTATION IS FOR THEE BECAUSE THOU ART IN SORE STRAITS FOR ALL THY FAIR FORTUNE AND GOODLINESS AND EXCEEDING COMELINESS SEEING THOU HAST NAUGHT WHEREWITHAL TO DO AND RECEIVE DELIGHT LIKE UNTO OTHER MEN QUOTH THE YOUTH THOU SAYST SOOTH BUT THOU MINDEST ME OF SOMEWHAT I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT IS THAT ASKED THE BATHKEEPER AND THE YOUTH ANSWERED TAKE THIS GOLD PIECE AND FETCH ME A PRETTY WOMAN THAT I MAY PROVE MY NATURE ON HER SO HE TOOK THE MONEY AND BETAKING HIMSELF TO HIS WIFE SAID TO HER O WOMAN THERE IS COME TO ME IN THE BATH
HE LAID DOWN A PAVEMENT OF GLASS OVER FLOWING WATER IN WHICH FISH WERE SWIMMING AND THUS SHE RAISED HER SKIRTS AS SHE APPROACHED HIM AND HE SAW THAT THE REPORT WAS TRUE
BRING ME THE FOUR TALISMANS AND BEWARE LEST THOU FORGET AUGHT OF THAT WHICH I HAVE TOLD THEE OR THOU WILT REPENT AND THERE WILL BE FEAR FOR THEE AND HE REPEATED HIS DIRECTIONS A SECOND AND A THIRD AND A FOURTH TIME TILL JUDAR SAID I HAVE THEM BY HEART
WHEREFORE BE THOU WISE AND WARE OF THEM IN THIS MATTER THE KING GAVE EAR TO HER SPEECH AND BADE PUT HIS SON TO DEATH
FN#193 I.E
I WOULD FAIN ASK THEE OF A THING WHEREOF DO THOU INFORM US ASK WHAT THOU WILT ANSWERED THE IFRIT DAHISH AND THE SHAYKH SAID ARE THERE HEREABOUTS ANY OF THE IFRITS IMPRISONED IN BOTTLES OF BRASS FROM THE TIME OF SOLOMON ON WHOM BE PEACE YES REPLIED THE JINNI

NOW THE SHIP HAD GONE DOWN HARD BY AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF THE MAIN AND THE WINDS AND WAVES BORE ME ON TILL BY PERMISSION OF THE MOST HIGH THEY CAST ME UP ON THE SHORE OF THE ISLAND AT THE LAST GASP FOR TOIL AND DISTRESS AND HALF DEAD WITH HUNGER AND THIRST
BUT HIS SKILL IN WEAPONS MADE HIM GROW UP A STUBBORN TYRANT AND A DEVIL ARROGANT USING TO RIDE FORTH A HUNTING AND A-CHASING AMONGST A THOUSAND HORSEMEN AND TO MAKE RAIDS AND RAZZIAS UPON THE NEIGHBOURING KNIGHTS CUTTING OFF CARAVANS AND CARRYING AWAY THE DAUGHTERS OF KINGS AND NOBLES
BUT BY AND BY SHE GAVE HIM POISON IN WATER AND MADE AN END OF HIM
THE CLASSICS HAD THE ALPHEUS PLINY V
AND I REPENTED OF WHAT I HAD DONE AND SAID BY ALLAH I HAVE MADE HASTE TO BRING DESTRUCTION UPON MYSELF THE DAY BEGAN TO WANE AS I WENT ALONG AND I LOOKED ABOUT FOR A PLACE WHERE I MIGHT PASS THE NIGHT BEING IN FEAR OF THE SERPENTS
INDEED I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CUNNING CONTRIVANCE TO COME TO NAUGHT BUT WILL LOOK HER OUT ANOTHER MAN AND CARRY HIM TO HER SO SHE WALKED ABOUT THE HIGHWAYS TILL HER EYES FELL ON A PRETTY FELLOW YOUNG AND DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING TO WHOM THE FOLK BOWED AND WHO BORE IN HIS FACE THE TRACES OF TRAVEL
THEN THE MERCHANT SOLD THE CHANDERS-WOOD AT HIS OWN PRICE AND QUITTING THE CITY OF SHARPERS RETURNED TO HIS OWN LAND AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
SO SIGNED TO ME FROM AFAR AS WHO SHOULD SAY TURN BACK AND TAKE THE RIGHT-HAND ROAD FOR THAT WILL LEAD THEE INTO THE KING'S HIGHWAY SO I TURNED BACK AS HE BADE ME AND FOLLOWED THE RIGHT-HAND ROAD NOW RUNNING FOR FEAR AND THEN WALKING LEISURELY TO REST ME TILL I WAS OUT OF THE OLD MAN'S SIGHT
THEN HE DRAVE AT THE LORD OF THE BANU NABHAN BRAVES

HOW MANY A KING THEY HUMBLED IN THEIR DAY
LíF A SUCCEDANEUM FOR THE UNCLEAN SPONGE NOT UNKNOWN IN THE TURKISH BATHS OF LONDON
NOR DID HE LAUGH ONCE TILL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH WHEN THEY BURIED HIM BESIDE THE SHAYKHS
NOR DID I DRINK MORE THAN AN OCCASIONAL DRAUGHT FOR FEAR MY VICTUAL SHOULD FAIL ME BEFORE MY DEATH
NOW THE CAUSE OF HIS COMING THITHER WAS THAT WHEN GHARIB SET OUT IN QUEST OF THE MOUNTAIN-GHUL SAHIM WAS ABSENT AND ON HIS RETURN NOT SEEING HIS BROTHER HE WENT IN TO HIS MOTHER WHOM HE FOUND WEEPING
THEY OPENED ONE OF THESE AND FOUND IT FULL OF WEAPONS CURIOUSLY ADORNED WITH OPEN WORK AND WITH GOLD AND SILVER DAMASCENE AND JEWELS
BUT AS FOR THE SLITTING OF THE PAUNCH THERE IS NO PUTTING UP WITH THAT SO SAYING HE SPRANG UP AND MADE OFF THROUGH THE GATE OF THE CITY HARDLY BELIEVING IN HIS ESCAPE
WHILST AS FOR JUDAR I HAVE HAD ABUNDANT GOOD OF HIM AND HE HATH HEARTENED MY HEART AND ENTREATED ME WITH HONOUR
SO AT TIMES THEY WOULD COME TO THEIR MOTHER HUMBLING THEMSELVES BEFORE HER EXCEEDINGLY AND COMPLAINING TO HER OF HUNGER
SO THEY SPREAD THE TABLES AND THE COMPANY ATE THE NIGHT-MEAL AND WENT THEIR WAYS MARVELLING AT THE TALE THEY HAD HEARD
SO BEWARE LEST THOU RELY UPON THEIR WORDS THE KING WAS PERSUADED AND TURNED FROM PUTTING HIS SON TO DEATH
SO ALL ON BOARD LANDED AND MADE FURNACES[FN#7 AND LIGHTING FIRES THEREIN BUSIED THEMSELVES IN VARIOUS WAYS SOME COOKING AND SOME WASHING WHILST OTHER SOME WALKED ABOUT THE ISLAND FOR SOLACE AND THE CREW FELL TO EATING AND DRINKING AND PLAYING AND SPORTING

LIKE OUR WEDDING-BREAKFAST BUT A MUCH MORE CEREMONIOUS AND IMPORTANT AFFAIR
AND LAUNCHED IT AND EMBARKING DID ACCORDING TO THE SAYING OF THE POET FLY FLY WITH LIFE WHENAS EVILS THREAT
SO WE FARED ON ALONG THE MOUNTAIN TILL WE FELL IN WITH A COMPANY OF FOLK AND I LOOKED AND SAW AMONGST THEM THE VERY MAN WHO HAD CARRIED ME AND CAST ME DOWN THERE
SO HE SET HIS LOAD THEREON TO TAKE REST AND SMELL THE AIR,--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
AND BUT FOR THE FEAR OF THOSE ARROWY EYES FROM HIS LOVELY CHEEK I HAD CULLED THE ROSE AND WHEN THE YOUTH SAW THAT SHE TO HIS BEAUTY DID INCLINE HE WAXT DRUNKEN WITHOUT WINE AND HIS LIFE WAS A LIGHT MATTER TO HIM COMPARED WITH HIS LOVE.[FN#233 PRESENTLY THE OLD WOMAN WENT OUT AND LEFT THEM ALONE TOGETHER TO ENJOY THEIR LOVES TILL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN SHE WENT INTO THEM AND GAVE THEM BOTH GOOD MORROW[FN#234 AND ASKED THE DAMSEL HOW HAST THOU PASSED THE NIGHT O MY LADY ANSWERED THE GIRL RIGHT WELL THANKS TO THY ADROITNESS AND THE EXCELLENCE OF THY GOING BETWEEN."[FN#235 THEN SAID THE OLD WOMAN UP LET US GO BACK TO THY MOTHER AT THESE WORDS THE YOUNG MAN PULLED OUT AN HUNDRED SEQUINS AND GAVE THEM TO HER SAYING TAKE THIS AND LEAVE HER WITH ME TO NIGHT SO SHE LEFT THEM AND REPAIRED TO THE GIRL'S MOTHER TO WHOM QUOTH SHE THY DAUGHTER SALUTETH THEE AND THE BRIDE'S MOTHER HATH SWORN HER TO ABIDE WITH HER THIS NIGHT REPLIED THE MOTHER O MY SISTER BEAR HER
WHEN I RELATED TO YOU THE MOST WONDERFUL THING IN MY TRAVELS AND I TOLD YOU THAT AT THE TIME WE CAST DOWN OUR SLAUGHTERED ANIMALS INTO THE VALLEY OF SERPENTS I CASTING WITH THE REST AS WAS MY WONT THERE CAME UP A MAN HANGING TO MINE YE BELIEVED ME NOT AND GAVE ME THE LIE YES QUOTH THEY THOU DIDST TELL US SOME SUCH TALE BUT WE HAD NO CALL TO CREDIT THEE HE RESUMED NOW THIS IS THE VERY MAN BY TOKEN THAT HE GAVE ME DIAMONDS OF GREAT VALUE AND HIGH PRICE WHOSE LIKE ARE NOT TO BE FOUND REQUITING ME MORE THAN WOULD HAVE COME UP STICKING TO MY QUARTER OF MEAT
SO THEY SET DOWN IN THAT SITE AND THEY LOOSED THE FALCONS AND LYNXES AND DOGS AND CAUGHT GREAT PLENTY OF GAME WHEREAT THEY REJOICED AND ABODE THERE SOME DAYS IN ALL JOYANCE OF LIFE AND ITS DELIGHT
I ALSO HAVE HEARD TELL A TALE CONCERNING THE FULLER AND HIS SON
THESE TROOPS HALTED AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM ME AND PRESENTLY THERE RODE FORTH FROM AMONGST THEM A KING PRECEDED BY SOME OF HIS CHIEF OFFICERS ON FOOT WHEN HE CAME UP TO THE YOUNG MAN SAITH THE TALE-TELLER HE DISMOUNTED ALSO AND THE TWO SALUTED EACH OTHER AFTER THE GOODLIEST FASHION
SAVE THAT A DANGER AWAITETH HIS YOUTH THE FATHER WAS SORELY CONCERNED AT THIS SAYING WHEN THEY ADDED BUT O KING HE SHALL ESCAPE FROM IT NOR SHALL AUGHT OF INJURY ACCRUE TO HIM HEREUPON THE KING CAST ASIDE ALL CARK AND CARE AND ROBED THE WIZARDS AND DISMISSED THEM WITH SPLENDID HONORARIA
AND THEY ATE AND DRANK TILL GHARIB'S WITS WERE DAZED BY THE DRINK
AND AFTER THIS HE TOOK A CHAFING DISH AND SETTING CHARCOAL THEREON BLEW ONE BREATH INTO IT AND IT KINDLED FORTHWITH
SO DID HE AND THEY HELD THE MARRIAGE FESTIVAL
MAY TIME NEVER PROVE THY FOE NOR THE SHIFTS OF FORTUNE PREVAIL OVER THEE
THEREUPON AL-SINDIBAD CONSULTED HIS PUPIL'S HOROSCOPE AND FOUND IT BARRED BY AN INAUSPICIOUS CONJUNCTION WHICH WOULD LAST SEVEN DAYS
THE EARTH CLOVE ASUNDER AND SWALLOWING THE MULE CLOSED UP AGAIN AS BEFORE
AND WHEN THE ELEPHANTS APPEARED AND WANDERED ABOUT AMONG THE TREES I SHOT MY ARROWS AT THEM AND CONTINUED TILL I HAD SHOT DOWN ONE OF THEM
AND THEY SAT AWHILE TOGETHER
BUT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE KING'S FAVOURITE CONCUBINE HAPPENED TO CAST EYES UPON HIS BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS HIS SYMMETRICAL STATURE HIS BRILLIANCY AND HIS PERFECT GRACE AND LOVE GAT HOLD OF HER HEART AND SHE WAS RAVISHED WITH HIS CHARMS.[FN#159 SO SHE WENT UP TO HIM AND THREW HERSELF UPON HIM BUT HE MADE HER NO RESPONSE

IN EGYPT THE BERBER FROM THE UPPER NILE IS THE FAVOURITE SUISSE
THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH HINDú WOMEN RAJPúTS MARáTHíS ETC

WHICH WHEN I SAW I FEARED FOR MY LIFE BY REASON OF THE STRAITNESS I HAD SUFFERED IN MY FORMER JOURNEY AND I WOULD FAIN HAVE STAYED THE RAFT AND LANDED ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE
I DESIRE NOT THAT WHEREOF THOU SPEAKEST AND IF THOU CONSTRAIN ME TO THAT I HAVE NO MIND TO I WILL SLAY MYSELF SO SABUR LEFT HER AND WENT IN TO GHARIB WHO ROSE TO HIM
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE DWELT IN EGYPT A CONFECTIONER WHO HAD A WIFE FAMED FOR BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS

ARMIES THEY LED AND PUISSANT MEN AND GAINED THEM GOLD GALORE
ON THE FIRST DOOR WERE WRITTEN THESE VERSES WHAT I LEFT I LEFT IT NOT FOR NOBILITY OF SOUL BUT THROUGH SENTENCE AND DECREE THAT TO EVERY MAN ARE DIGHT
WHEN NOT TROUBLED BY MAN
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-THIRD NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE EMIR MUSA PASSED ON TO THE THIRD TABLET WHEREON WAS WRITTEN O SON OF ADAM THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD THOU LOVEST AND PRIZEST AND THE HEST OF THY LORD THOU SPURNEST AND DESPISEST
93 AND A HOST OF CLASSICAL GEOGRAPHERS
SO THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL HATH SENT US HITHER TO BRING HIM SOME OF THESE CUCURBITES THAT HE MAY LOOK THEREON AND SOLACE HIMSELF WITH THEIR SIGHT
AND THIS SAID THE DAMSEL HAVE I TOLD THEE O KING THAT THOU MAYST KNOW THAT WICKED WAZIRS DEAL NOT HONESTLY BY NOR COUNSEL WITH SINCERE INTENT THEIR KINGS
THEN HE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AND FORTIFYING HIMSELF HEREIN ESTABLISHED HIS HOME IN THIS PLACE WHENCE HE IS WONT TO SALLY FORTH AND CUT THE ROAD OF ALL THAT COME AND GO PRESENTLY RETURNING TO THE VALLEY HE HAUNTETH
KHWáJAH OUR HOWAJEE MEANING A SCHOOLMASTER A MAN OF LETTERS A GENTLEMAN
THEN HE BADE UNBIND THE PERSIANS AND TURNING TO THE PRINCESS SAID TO HER WHAT BROUGHT THEE FORTH OF THY PALACE TO THE WILDS AND WASTES SO THAT THE HIGHWAY ROBBERS MADE PRIZE OF THEE SHE REPLIED O MY LORD MY FATHER AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF HIS REALM TURKS AND DAYLAMITES ARE MAGIANS WORSHIPPING FIRE AND NOT THE ALL-POWERFUL KING
THE BADAWI HAVE CURIOUS PREJUDICES ABOUT IT
THEN HE BUFFETED HIS FACE LIKE A WOMAN AND PLUCKED OUT HIS BEARD AND FELL DOWN IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP WILL NIGH FAINTING FOR STRESS OF GRIEF AND RAGE AND CRYING OH AND ALAS FOR THE RUIN OF MY HOUSE AND THE ORPHANSHIP OF MY POOR CHILDREN SO ALL THE MERCHANT AND SAILORS CAME ROUND ABOUT HIM AND ASKED HIM O MASTER WHAT IS THE MATTER
BUT FOR LACK OF FOOD THEY HAD PERISHED AND TASTED THE CUP OF DEATH
WHAT HATH UNMINDED THEE OF THE DEATH-DAY'S MISCHANCE
AND BEING A POOR WOMAN I FEARED ITS OWNER AND DARED NOT FACE HIM NOW THE GIRL'S HUSBAND WAS LISTENING TO ALL THEY SAID,--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
YET WE NEVER SEE HIM BUY AUGHT AND HE HATH NEITHER KITCHENER NOR KITCHEN NOR DOTH HE LIGHT A FIRE
NOW WHEN GHARIB SAW HIS BROTHER IN THE GHUL'S CLUTCHES HE CRIED OUT SAYING ALLAHO AKBAR GOD IS MOST GREAT
SO SHE TOOK HORSE AND RIDING THITHER WITH HIM DISMOUNTED AND ENTERED
THEN GHARIB ABODE THE KING'S GUEST TEN DAYS WHEN HE WOULD HAVE DEPARTED BUT SABUR CLAD HIM IN AN HONOURABLE ROBE AND SWORE HIM BY HIS FAITH THAT HE SHOULD NOT MARCH FOR A WHOLE MONTH
I REACHED THIS CITY AT THE LAST OF THE DAY AND FINDING THE GATE LOCKED AND BARRED THREW ME DOWN TO SLEEP WITHOUT THE WALLS
AND I FORGOT WHAT I HAD SUFFERED SEEING THE GREAT GAIN AND PROFIT I HAD MADE TILL ONE DAY AS I SAT MAKING MERRY AND ENJOYING MYSELF WITH MY FRIENDS THERE CAME IN TO ME A COMPANY OF MERCHANTS WHOSE CASE TOLD TALES OF TRAVEL AND TALKED WITH ME OF VOYAGE AND ADVENTURE AND GREATNESS OF PELF AND LUCRE
WE WAVE HAND OR FINGER TOWARDS OURSELVES
TO JUDGE FROM THE RIVER BUT THE TEXT NAMES SARANDIB CEYLON ISLAND FAMOUS FOR GEMS
THEN THEY DROVE AT EACH OTHER AND FOUGHT A GREAT WHILE WHEELING AND FALSING ADVANCING AND RETREATING TILL THE PRINCESS FINDING IN HIM SUCH COURAGE AND CAVALARICE AS SHE HAD SEEN IN NONE ELSE BEGAN TO FEAR FOR HERSELF LEST HE PUT HER TO SHAME BEFORE THE BYSTANDERS AND KNEW THAT HE WOULD ASSUREDLY OVERCOME HER
MOREOVER HE MADE ME HIS AGENT FOR THE PORT AND REGISTRAR OF ALL SHIPS THAT ENTERED THE HARBOUR

I WAS ONE OF THE WALKERS BUT AS WE WERE THUS ENGAGED BEHOLD THE MASTER WHO WAS STANDING ON THE GUNWALE CRIED OUT TO US AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE SAYING HO THERE
THE MELLAY WAXED HOT WITH CUT AND THRUST
SO SHE KISSED GROUND BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND SAID O KING MAY MY LIFE RANSOM THY LIFE
THERE WAS ONCE A MAN AND A MERCHANT NAMED OMAR AND HE HAD FOR ISSUE THREE SONS THE ELDEST CALLED SáLIM THE YOUNGEST JúDAR AND THE CADET SALíM
THEN TAKING THE MONEY HE DELIVERED THE GIRL TO THE GOLDSMITH CONDITIONING THAT HE SHOULD NOT ABIDE ONE HOUR WITH HER IN THE CITY
BELIKE THOU MAYST BUY THEE WHEREWITHAL TO TRAFFIC
AFTER WHICH HE WENT UP TO THE UPPER ROOM AND SITTING DOWN BETWEEN HIS BROTHERS SAID TO HIS MOTHER BRING THE SUPPER."[FN#286 SO SHE WENT DOWN TO THE SALOON AND FINDING THERE THE DISHES READY LAID THE TRAY AND BROUGHT UP THE FORTY DISHES ONE AFTER OTHER
SO THEY MARVELLED AT HIS CASE AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE DID THERE WITH THE JEWELS
HE REJOICED IN MY RETURN AND SAID TO ME BY ALLAH THOU HAST MADE MY HEART SORE
BUT WHEN I SAW THEE I LONGED FOR LIFE AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
WHEREUPON HE THANKED THEM AND REJOICED IN THEM

BUT I SAW NO ONE WHEREAT I MARVELLED WITH GREAT MARVEL AND PRESENTLY REMEMBERED A STORY I HAD HEARD AFORETIME OF TRADERS AND PILGRIMS AND TRAVELLERS
FOR THOSE MOUNTAINS ADJOIN THE FRONTIERS OF HIS PROVINCE THE CALIPH APPROVED HIS COUNSEL AND SAID THOU HAST SPOKEN SOOTH O TALIB AND I DESIRE THAT TOUCHING THIS MATTER THOU BE MY MESSENGER TO MUSA BIN NUSAYR

GHARIB SAT DOWN ON SA'ADAN'S CHAIR WHICH HAD AFORETIME BELONGED TO SáSá[FN#339 BIN SHAYS BIN SHADDAD BIN AD CAUSING SAHIM TO STAND ON HIS RIGHT AND HIS COMPANIONS ON HIS EITHER HAND AND SENDING FOR THE GHUL OF THE MOUNTAIN SAID TO HIM HOW FINDEST THOU THYSELF O ACCURSED REPLIED SA'ADAN O MY LORD IN THE SORRIEST OF PLIGHTS FOR ABASEMENT AND MORTIFICATION
WHERE BE CANAAN AND ZU‘L-AUTAD,[FN#146 LORD OF THE STAKES
SO HE CALLED HIM AND SAID TO HIM GO TO THIS STRANGER HOST AND FIND OUT WHO THEY BE AND WHAT THEY WANT AND RETURN QUICKLY ACCORDINGLY HE SPED LIKE THE WIND TO THE PERSIAN TENTS WHERE A COMPANY OF ARABS ROSE UP AND MET HIM SAYING WHO ART THOU AND WHAT DOST THOU REQUIRE HE REPLIED I AM A MESSENGER AND AN ENVOY FROM THE LORD OF THE CITY TO YOUR CHIEF SO THEY TOOK HIM AND CARRIED HIM THROUGH THE LINES OF TENTS PAVILIONS AND STANDARDS TILL THEY CAME TO GHARIB'S SHAHMIYáNAH AND TOLD HIM OF THE MISSION
NOR DID THEY LEAVE JOURNEYING A WHOLE YEAR'S SPACE TILL ONE MORNING WHEN THE DAY BROKE AFTER THEY HAD TRAVELLED ALL NIGHT BEHOLD THE SHAYKH FOUND HIMSELF IN A LAND HE KNEW NOT AND SAID THERE IS NO MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT QUOTH THE EMIR WHAT IS TO DO O SHAYKH
ONE DAY BEING MINDED TO JOURNEY TO A CERTAIN CITY HE ASKED THOSE WHO CAME THENCE SAYING WHAT KIND OF GOODS BROUGHT MOST PROFIT THERE AND THEY ANSWERED CHANDERS-WOOD
AND AS OFTEN AS HER HUSBAND CAME HOME SHE PUT THE PRINCE BACK INTO THE CHEST AND LOCKED IT UPON HIM
SHUN TYRANNY
THEN CAME THE COBBLER
WHEN IT WAS THE SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIRST NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE EUNUCH HAVING PUT TO FLIGHT THE EMIR OTHMAN THE KING'S OFFICER AND HIS MEN TILL THEY WERE DRIVEN FAR FROM JUDAR'S GATE RETURNED AND SAT DOWN ON HIS CHAIR AT THE DOOR CARING FOR NONE
A TERM COMPOSED OF TWO GOOD OLD PERSIAN WORDS MIHR THE SUN WHENCE MITHRAS AND JáN"=LIFE
HERE HE FOUND TEN SHAYKHS IN MOURNING APPAREL SEATED ONE OPPOSITE OTHER WEEPING AND WAILING
AND SENECA NAT
THEN SAID SHE O MY SONS YE HAVE DIVIDED THE GOLD AND THE JEWELS BUT THIS MAY NOT BE DIVIDED NOR CAN ITS VALUE BE MADE UP IN MONEY
SO THE ARABS AND THE PERSIANS ENTERED WITH THEM FIGHTING AND SA'ADAN SNATCHING A MACE FROM ONE OF THE SLAIN WIELDED IT IN THE ENEMY'S FACE AND GAINED THE CITY RACE-COURSE
THEN KNOCK A SECOND TIME A KNOCK LOUDER THAN THE FIRST AND WAIT ANOTHER WHILE
ALL THIS WHILE THE FOLK IN THE CABINET HEARING EVERYTHING THAT PASSED BUT NOT DARING TO SAY A WORD
FN#30 ARAB
A FAVOURITE WAY OF KEEPING FINE CLOTHES IN THE EAST IS TO LAY THEM FOLDED IN A PIECE OF ROUGH LONG-CLOTH WITH PEPPER AND SPICES TO DRIVE AWAY MOTHS
BUT WHEN THE RAIN CEASETH THE LEAF TURNETH OVER AND DROOPETH DOWN BY THE SIDE OF THE BUNCH.[FN#68 HERE I TOOK IN GREAT STORE OF PEPPER AND CLOVES AND CINNAMON IN EXCHANGE FOR COCOA-NUTS AND WE PASSED THENCE TO THE ISLAND OF AL-USIRAT,[FN#69 WHENCE COMETH THE COMORIN ALOES-WOOD AND THENCE TO ANOTHER ISLAND FIVE DAYS JOURNEY IN LENGTH WHERE GROWS THE CHINESE LIGN-ALOES WHICH IS BETTER THAN THE COMORIN
SO MAKING UP MY MIND I LAID IN GREAT PLENTY OF GOODS SUITABLE FOR A SEA-VOYAGE AND REPAIRING TO BASSORAH WENT DOWN TO THE SHORE AND FOUND THERE A FINE SHIP READY TO SAIL WITH A FULL CREW AND A NUMEROUS COMPANY OF MERCHANTS MEN OF WORTH AND SUBSTANCE

AND QUOTH THE MOOR I WOULD HAVE THEE DO WITH ME AS THOU DIDST WITH MY BROTHER THEN HE GAVE HIM A SILKEN CORD SAYING BIND MY HANDS BEHIND ME AND THROW ME IN AND IF I FARE AS DID MY BROTHER TAKE THE MULE TO THE JEW AND HE WILL GIVE THEE OTHER HUNDRED DINARS SAID JUDAR COME ON SO HE CAME AND HE BOUND HIM AND PUSHED HIM INTO THE LAKE WHERE HE SANK
HERE HE HANGED A ROPE-LADDER WITH GRAPPLING-IRONS TO THE BATTLEMENTS AND CLIMBED UP TO THE TERRACE-ROOF OF THE PALACE
NOR DID I LET HIM GO TILL SOME BECAME SURETY FOR HIM THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO ME TO-MORROW AND SATISFY ME FOR MY EYE QUOTH THE OLDSTER IF HE WILL HE MAY HAVE THE BETTER OF THEE AND THOU THE WORSE HOW SO ASKED THE SHARPER
I LOOKED AT HIM AND KNEW HIM FOR THE HERDSMAN WHO HAD CHARGE OF PASTURING MY FELLOWS AND WITH HIM WERE MANY OTHERS IN LIKE CASE
IF A DAUGHTER BE VOUCHSAFED TO HIM SHE WILL BE THE RUIN OF HIS REALM
THE EMIR DREW NEAR UNTO THESE AND BEHOLD AMONGST THEM WAS A GREAT TOMB WIDE AND LONG
THE MERCHANT BADE THE PORTERS TAKE IT UP AND CARRY IT TO HIS HOUSE IN THE TOWN
AND BETWEEN THEM ON ONE OF THE STEPS OF THE COUCH LAY A GOLDEN TABLET WHEREON WERE WRITTEN IN CHARACTERS OF WHITE SILVER THE FOLLOWING WORDS
ON THE CAPITAL OF THE COLUMN STOOD A BIRD FASHIONED OF RED RUBIES AND HOLDING IN HIS BILL A PEARL WHICH SHONE LIKE A STAR
THE WISE AND ANCIENT BIRD WHICH SITS UPON THE ASH-TREE YGGDRASIL AND THE DRAGONS GRIFFINS BASILISKS ETC
AND GIVING A GREAT CRY SPRANG UPON THE MARE AND COVERED HER
AND HE ANSWERED O MY LORD THERE ARE DIVERS BALES OF MERCHANDISE IN THE HOLD WHOSE OWNER WAS DROWNED FROM AMONGST US AT ONE OF THE ISLANDS ON OUR COURSE
HOW THEN WOULDST THOU STRIP ME NAKED THEN DO THOU SAY EXCEPT THOU PUT OFF THY CLOTHES I WILL KILL THEE AND LOOK TO THY RIGHT WHERE THOU WILT SEE A SWORD HANGING UP
THE KING MOURNED FOR HIS SON WITH SORE MOURNING AND SENT FOR THE WISE MEN AND MASTERS OF ESOTERIC SCIENCE THAT THEY MIGHT DISCOVER AND EXPLAIN TO HIM THIS THING WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIS SON BUT NONE COULD GIVE HIM AN ANSWER
IN THE VERSIONS ARABIC AND GREEK SYNTIPAS THE KING FORGETS HIS RING
JUMA'AH WHICH MEANS EITHER FRIDAY OR A WEEK

HE ASKED THE REASON OF HER TEARS AND SHE TOLD HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED OF HIS BROTHER'S JOURNEY WHEREUPON WITHOUT ALLOWING HIMSELF AUGHT OF REST HE DONNED HIS WAR-GEAR AND MOUNTING RODE AFTER GHARIB TILL HE OVERTOOK HIM AND THERE BEFEL BETWEEN THEM WHAT BEFEL
THEN WE SAT DOWN IN THE COURTYARD A LITTLE WHILE AND PRESENTLY FALLING ASLEEP SLEPT FROM THE FORENOON TILL SUNDOWN WHEN LO

SO WE BESOUGHT THE ALMIGHTY AND CALLED FOR SUCCOUR UPON HIS APOSTLE ON WHOM BE BLESSING AND PEACE WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA-MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA

BUT SEVERAL TRIBES OF RAJPUTS AND OTHER RACES CLAIM THE HONOURABLE GENEALOGY
HE MARVELLED AT THEIR CASE AND PURPOSED TO ASK THE REASON WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE CONDITION AND HELD HIS PEACE
THEY WERE LONG IN BRINGING THE GOODS ASHORE SO I ASKED THE MASTER IS THERE AUGHT LEFT IN THY SHIP
I TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN ME FROM THE DAY OF MY LEAVING BAGHDAD-CITY WHEREUPON HE WONDERED WITH GREAT WONDER AT MY ADVENTURES HE AND HIS COURTIERS AND BADE ME SIT BY HIM
THE ARABS IN AN EARLY DAY WERE EAGER STUDENTS OF GREEK LITERATURE
NOW THE OILMAN HAD A CAT WHICH SPRANG UPON THE BIRD AND THE HUNTSMAN'S DOG SEEING THE CAT SPRANG UPON IT AND SLEW IT

AND UNDER NO RULE IS MAN SOCIALLY FREER AND HIS CONDITION CONTRASTS STRANGELY WITH THE GRINDING SOCIAL TYRANNY WHICH CHARACTERISES EVERY MODE OF DEMOCRACY OR CONSTITUTIONALISM I.E
THEREUPON GHARIB'S REASON FLED FROM HIS HEAD AND HE SWOONED AWAY AND WAS NIGH UPON DEATH
AFTER WHICH I SAT TILL NIGHTFALL HEARING NO VOICE AND SEEING NONE INHABITANT
SO HE TOOK IT UP IN HIS HAND AND LOOKED AT IT AND DEEMED IT MAN'S SEED
WHERE IS NIMROD WHO REVOLTED AGAINST ALLAH AND DEFIED HIM

HE CONTINUED GAZING AT THE SHIP UNTIL IT DREW NIGH WHEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS A FOYST BUILDED ALL OF IVORY AND EBONY INLAID WITH GLISTENING GOLD MADE FAST BY NAILS OF STEEL WITH OARS OF SANDAL AND LIGN-ALOES
TO THIS HE CONSENTED AND WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HER WANTS SHE SAID TO HIM GIVE ME THIS SEAL RING I SEE ON THY FINGER SO HE GAVE HER HIS SIGNET AND SHE SET IT IN A SILKEN KERCHIEF SHE HAD WITH HER WHEREIN WERE MORE THAN FOUR SCORE OTHERS
WHEN MARDAS CAME IN SIGHT OF HIS CAMP HE SAW SLAIN MEN LYING ABOUT AND BIRDS HOVERING OVER THEM RIGHT AND LEFT
AND THEY EMBRACED AND SALUTED EACH OTHER AND SABUR BENT OVER GHARIB'S HAND AND KISSED IT AND THANKED HIM FOR HIS FAVOURS.[FN#351 THEY PITCHED THEIR PAVILIONS IN FACE OF EACH OTHER AND SABUR WENT IN TO HIS DAUGHTER WHO ROSE AND EMBRACING HIM TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN HER AND HOW GHARIB HAD RESCUED HER FROM THE CLUTCHES OF THE GHUL OF THE MOUNTAIN

HIS SON FOLLOWED HIM AND THE TWAIN WENT ON TILL THEY CAME UP WITH GHARIB AND HIS COMPANY WHEN THE GHUL FELL UPON THEM WITHOUT WORD SAID AND SLEW FIVE MEN WITH HIS CLUB
WHEREFORE LET US ABIDE AS WE ARE LEST YOUR BROTHER COME BACK AND WE BE DISGRACED BUT THEY ACCEPTED NOT HER WORDS AND PASSED THE NIGHT WRANGLING WITH EACH OTHER

AND IF TOMORROW THOU HAVE NO BETTER LUCK COME AND TAKE BREAD AND BE NOT ABASHED FOR I WILL GIVE THEE CREDIT SO JUDAR TOOK THE BREAD AND MONEY AND WENT HOME
THE BLACKSMITH MADE IT INTO A BLADE THREE FEET LONG BY TWO SPANS BROAD A KIND OF FALCHION OR CHOPPER CASED IT WITH GOLD AND CALLED IT DHáMI THE TRENCHANT FROM ITS SHARPNESS
AT LAST HE RESORTED TO AN OLD WOMAN WHO DWELT HARD BY AND AFTER SALUTING HER HE SAT DOWN AND COMPLAINED TO HER OF HIS SUFFERINGS FOR LOVE OF THE WOMAN AND HIS LONGING TO ENJOY HER
MY WIFE IS THE MOST VIRTUOUS WOMAN OF THE AGE AND ALL THINE ACCUSATIONS OF HER ARE LIES SO IN HIS WRATH HE DASHED THE CAGE UPON THE GROUND TORE OFF THE PARROT'S HEAD AND THREW IT FROM THE WINDOW
WHEN I SAW THIS I AROSE AND UNWINDING MY TURBAND FROM MY HEAD DOUBLED IT AND TWISTED IT INTO A ROPE WITH WHICH I GIRT MY MIDDLE AND BOUND MY WAIST FAST TO THE LEGS OF THE RUKH SAYING IN MYSELF PERADVENTURE THIS BIRD MAY CARRY ME TO A LAND OF CITIES AND INHABITANTS AND THAT WILL BE BETTER THAN ABIDING IN THIS DESERT ISLAND I PASSED THE NIGHT WATCHING AND FEARING TO SLEEP LEST THE BIRD SHOULD FLY AWAY WITH ME UNAWARES
BUT JUDAR AND HIS BROTHERS WASTED MUCH MONEY IN BRIBES TO HIM
WHEREUPON THE OWNER STRUCK OFF THE MAKER'S HEAD A MOST SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO ALL BUT ONE
PRESENTLY I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CAVE NEARHAND WITH A NARROW DOORWAY

SO I BEGAN TO SPEAK TO HIM AND HE ANSWERED WITHOUT STIRRING WHEREAT WRATH GET HOLD OF ME AND I DREW THE MACE UPON HIM THINKING TO SMITE HIM
AFTER WHICH I FETCHED A BLACKSMITH AND DESCRIBED TO HIM THE FASHION OF THE STIRRUPS AND BRIDLE-BIT
HE PASSED THE NIGHT IN HIS OWN PLACE AND WITH EARLY MORNING REPAIRED TO THE ABODE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN WHO RECEIVED HIM WITH HONOUR AND SEATED HIM BY HIS SIDE
THEN SAID THEY TO HER O ACCURSED WOMAN DOST THOU LOVE JUDAR WITH ALL THIS LOVE WHILST AS FOR US WHETHER WE BE ABSENT OR PRESENT THOU NEITHER JOYEST IN US NOR SORROWEST FOR US
SO HE LOOKED FORTH FROM THE BATTLEMENTS OF THE PALACE AND SEEING A CONQUERING HOST ALL OF THEM PERSIANS ENCAMPED BEFORE THE CITY SAID TO THE CITIZENS O FOLK WHAT DO YONDER AJAMS WANT
BUT WE HAVE A YEARLY FAIR WHEN MERCHANTS COME TO US FROM VARIOUS QUARTERS TO BUY UP THESE IVORIES
ON THE OTHER HAND THE HINDUS HAVE MORE QUADRILLIONS THAN MODERN EUROPE
AFTER WHICH HE GAVE THE PORTER AN HUNDRED DINARS AS USUAL AND HE AND THE REST OF THE COMPANY WENT THEIR WAYS GLAD AT HEART AND MARVELLING AT THE TALES THEY HAD HEARD FOR THAT EACH STORY WAS MORE EXTRAORDINARY THAN THAT WHICH FOREWENT IT
BUT AS ORIENTAL HISTORY SHOWS THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT IS A DESPOTISM TEMPERED BY ASSASSINATION

MAJOR RENNEL PLACES THE FAMOUS MINES OF PAUNA OR PURNA IN A MOUNTAIN-TRACT OF MORE THAN 200 MILES SQUARE TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE JUMNA
THE YOUTH WAS DAZED AND KNEW NOT WHITHER HE SHOULD WEND BUT AFTER A FEW DAYS AS HE SAT PONDERING HIS CASE HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE SAILS OF A SHIP IN THE MIDDLEMOST OF THE MAIN AS IT WERE A STAR IN THE SKY
AND BEHOLD THE KAZI WAS THE FIRST TO APPEAR DEVANCING THE REST AND WHEN SHE SAW HIM SHE ROSE TO HER FEET AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE HIM
SO COMPELLED BY FATE AND FORTUNE I RESOLVED TO UNDERTAKE ANOTHER VOYAGE
THE ENEMY WHO WAS NOT AFRAID OF DEATH WAS STRUCK WITH TERROR BY THE IDEA OF BEING DEVOURED AND THIS SEEMS INSTINCTIVE TO THE UNDEVELOPED MIND
AS IN THIS SORE CASE I WALKED ALONG THE VALLEY BEHOLD THERE FELL DOWN BEFORE ME A SLAUGHTERED BEAST
THOU HAST SAVED A TRUE BELIEVER FROM SLAUGHTER AND IT HAPPED AFTER THIS FASHION
AND RESTED UNDER THE TREES FROM ONE OF WHICH I CUT ME A STAFF TO LEAN UPON
THE SERPENT IS AN EXAGGERATION OF THE PYTHON WHICH GROWS TO AN ENORMOUS SIZE
A CERTAIN MAN HAD LONGED ALL HIS LIFE TO LOOK UPON THE NIGHT OF POWER,[FN#216 AND ONE NIGHT IT BEFEL THAT HE GAZED AT THE SKY AND SAW THE ANGELS AND HEAVEN'S GATES THROWN OPEN
SEEING THIS HE CALLED THE MINISTER IN QUESTION AND SAID TO HIM THIS IS THE NECKLACE I GAVE THEE HE KNEW IT AT FIRST SIGHT AND ANSWERED IT IS
II MAKES THE ARABIAN ISLAND SOBORMA OR MAHRáJ=BORNEO
AND SHE ANSWERED THEY SLEW EACH OTHER ON MY ACCOUNT WHEREUPON AJIB BARED HIS BLADE AND SMOTE HER AND CUT HER IN TWAIN
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY-THIRD NIGHT SHE CONTINUED IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN'S GUESTS WERE ALL GATHERED TOGETHER HE THUS BESPAKE THEM:--I WAS LIVING A MOST ENJOYABLE LIFE UNTIL ONE DAY MY MIND BECAME POSSESSED WITH THE THOUGHT OF TRAVELLING ABOUT THE WORLD OF MEN AND SEEING THEIR CITIES AND ISLANDS
I ABRIDGE
HOWEVER AFTER A WHILE MY EAGER GLANCES FELL UPON SOME GREAT WHITE THING AFAR OFF IN THE INTERIOR OF THE ISLAND
AS FOR ME I WILL NOT GO BACK FROM MY DUE TILL I DIE SO THE KING ONCE MORE COMMANDED TO PUT HIS SON TO DEATH
THUS DEFEAT BEFEL OUR KING AND WE BECAME A SPOIL UNTO SOLOMON
MOSES KALíM THE SPEAKER WITH ALLAH
THEN HE ROSE FORTHRIGHT AND WITHDRAWING TO HIS SITTING-SALOON SENT FOR HIS WIFE WHO WAS THE DAUGHTER OF HIS UNCLE
100 IBS ABOUT 98 3/4 IBS
AND I WILL CONTENT ME WITH AN HUNDRED DINARS FOR EACH DEAD MAN THEN HE TOOK THE MULE TO THE JEW WHO SEEING HIM ASKED THE OTHER IS DEAD ANSWERED JUDAR MAY THY HEAD LIVE
172 WHERE I NOTE THAT THE INTEREST IS INJURED BY THE GRATUITOUS INCEST BUT THIS HAS A DEEPER MEANING AND A GRANDER ARTISTIC EFFECT
PRESENTLY HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CORNER OF THE VEIL PROTRUDING FROM UNDER THE CUSHION
ON THE FIFTH DAY THEY ARRIVED AT FEZ AND MEQUINEZ AND ENTERED THE CITY WHERE ALL WHO MET THE MAGHRIBI SALUTED HIM AND KISSED HIS HANDS
WHILE ÆSOP'S FABLE OF THE LION AND THE MAN ALSO EXPLAINS THEIR FREQUENCY
FN#334 ARAB
IT IS SITUATED IN THE MAGHRIB MAURITANIA THE REGION OF MAGIC AND MYSTERY
NOW I WAS WEARY AND HUNGRY AND THIRSTY
WHOM THOU WILT THOU EXALTEST AND WHOM THOU WILT THOU ABASEST AND THERE IS NO GOD BUT THOU
PRONOUNCED NIHáS
WHEREAT HE JOYED WITH EXCEEDING JOY AND WAS LIKE TO FLY FOR GLADNESS
I HAVE GIVEN SOME SPECIMENS OF WASM IN THE LAND OF MIDIAN I
AL-KAZWINI LOCATES THE CHAOS IN THE VALLEY OF THE MOON AMONGST THE MOUNTAINS OF SERENDIB CEYLON
AND AFTER STABLISHING HIM THEREIN WENT FORTH AND FASTENED THE DOOR WITH SEVEN PADLOCKS
FN#104 THIS IS A TRUE CITY OF BRASS NUHáS ASFAR=YELLOW COPPER AS WE LEARN IN NIGHT DCCLXXII
WHEN HE HAD DONE HIS WILL OF HER HE DISMOUNTED AND WOULD HAVE CARRIED HER AWAY WITH HIM BUT COULD NOT BY REASON OF THE TETHER
WHEREWITH PEACE BE WITH YE AND I PRAY ALLAH TO KEEP YOU FROM SICKNESS AND CALAMITY AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
BUT REFER THE READER TO MR CLOUSTON OF WHOM MORE IN A FUTURE PAGE
WE FIND IT IN GENESIS III
AND WHEN IN MY COMFORT AND PLEASURES AND MERRY-MAKINGS AND IN MY REJOICING OVER MY LARGE GAINS AND PROFITS I HAD FORGOTTEN ALL I HAD ENDURED OF PERILS AND SUFFERINGS THE CARNAL MAN WAS AGAIN SEIZED WITH THE LONGING TO TRAVEL AND TO SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND ISLANDS.[FN#56 ACCORDINGLY I BOUGHT COSTLY MERCHANDISE SUITED TO MY PURPOSE AND MAKING IT UP INTO BALES REPAIRED TO BASSORAH WHERE I WALKED ABOUT THE RIVER-QUAY TILL I FOUND A FINE TALL SHIP NEWLY BUILDED WITH GEAR UNUSED AND FITTED READY FOR SEA
AFTER WHICH HE FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM PROSTRATE AND WEEPING AND REPEATED THESE VERSES O MY LORD WELL I WEET THY PUISSANT HAND
AND FROM TIME EXPECT THY REVENGE TO SEE
WHILST THE SELLER PURPOSED TO TAKE AN EQUAL QUANTITY OF GOLD FOR IT
WELCOME TO THEE O MY MOTHER
THAT SHALT THOU NOT OPEN AND IF THOU OPEN IT THOU SHALT REPENT WHEN REPENTANCE WILL AVAIL THEE NAUGHT
FOR AN THOU COME NOT TO ME I WILL ASSUREDLY COME TO THEE SO THE MESSENGER RETURNED TO SOLOMON AND TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD PASSED AND WHATSO HAD BEFALLEN HIM WHICH WHEN THE PROPHET HEARD HE RAGED LIKE DOOMSDAY AND ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE FRAY AND LEVIED ARMIES OF MEN AND JANN AND BIRDS AND REPTILES

FN#179 IN THE BOOK OF SINDIBAD THIS IS THE STORY OF THE PRINCE WHO WENT OUT TO HUNT AND THE STRATAGEM WHICH THE WAZIR PRACTISED ON HIM FN#180 I HAVE NOTED THAT IT IS A DIRE AFFRONT TO AN ARAB IF HIS FIRST COUSIN MARRY ANY SAVE HIMSELF WITHOUT HIS FORMAL LEAVE
THEN QUOTH HE BRING A DRESS FOR MY MOTHER AND ANOTHER FOR MYSELF AND ALSO FOR MY BROTHERS SO THE JINNI FETCHED ALL THAT WAS NEEDED AND CLAD THE FEMALE SLAVES SAYING TO THEM THIS IS YOUR MISTRESS
SO I REQUIRED OF HIM THE HEAD OF THE GHUL OF THE MOUNTAIN WHEREFORE HE WENT TO HIM AND AFTER ENGAGING HIM IN SINGULAR COMBAT MADE THE MASTER HIS MAN AND TOOK THE CASTLE OF SASA BIN SHAYS BIN SHADDAD BIN AD WHEREIN ARE THE TREASURES OF THE ANCIENTS AND THE HOARDS OF THE MODERNS
FOR I WENT ABOUT IN FEAR LEST MY WIFE SHOULD DIE BEFORE ME AND THEY BURY ME ALIVE WITH HER
FN#71 ARAB
THENCE HE SAW AN IFRIT RISE OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE STREAM BEARING ON HIS HEAD A CHEST OF MARBLE SECURED BY A PADLOCK
LARGE AND SMALL BLACK AND WHITE SWEET AND SOUR
AND DO THOU GRANT ME O MY MASTER THY GRACIOUS LEAVE TO RETURN TO MY OWN COUNTRY YES QUOTH HE THOU SHALT HAVE THAT PERMISSION
BUT HE CLUNG TO ME AND GRIPPED MY NECK WITH HIS LEGS TILL I WAS WELL-NIGH CHOKED THE WORLD GREW BLACK IN MY SIGHT AND I FELL SENSELESS TO THE GROUND LIKE ONE DEAD
WHEN THEY REACHED THE TOP THEY BEHELD BENEATH THEM A CITY NEVER SAW EYES A GREATER OR A GOODLIER WITH DWELLING-PLACES AND MANSIONS OF TOWERING HEIGHT AND PALACES AND PAVILIONS AND DOMES GLEAMING GLORIOUSLY BRIGHT AND SCONCES AND BULWARKS OF STRENGTH INFINITE
AT LAST HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CHARMING LADY LOOKING AND LEANING OUT OF ONE OF THE WINDOWS,[FN#202 AND BEING SMITTEN WITH AMAZEMENT AT HER GRACE AND CHARMS CAST ABOUT FOR A MEANS OF GETTING TO HER BUT COULD FIND NONE
THEN I WENT TO MY FRIEND AND TOLD HIM OF THE COMING OF THE SHIP AND HOW I HAD A MIND TO RETURN TO MY OWN COUNTRY
ASK WHAT THOU WILT AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN THEE
SO THEY TOOK THE ROAD TO WHICH HE POINTED WHICH WAS THE RIGHT WAY AND FINDING IT A BEATEN TRACK FARED ON THROUGH THEIR DAYS AND NIGHTS TILL THEY HAD COVERED A WIDE TRACT OF COUNTRY
BUT GHARIB CRIED OUT TO HIS TROOPS SAYING UP AND AFTER THE RUNAWAYS SO THE PERSIANS AND THE ARABS CRAVE AFTER THE KING OF BABEL AND HIS HOST AND CAUSED SWORD TO SMITE THEM TILL THEY SLEW OF THEM TWENTY THOUSAND OR MORE
PILGRIMAGE LOC
NOW I WAS IN THE SHIP AND KNEW NOT WHAT THEY DID
BUT IT IS TOLD ME THAT THOU KNOWEST IT WELL AND THE WAYS THITHER
532 SAYS THAT THE CELEBES PRODUCE PEARLS BIG AS TURTLE-DOVES EGGS
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-EIGHTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE PORTER AFTER KISSING GROUND BETWEEN THEIR HANDS STOOD WITH HIS HEAD BOWED DOWN IN HUMBLE ATTITUDE
SO TAKE ME TO SERVE THINE HANDMAIDENS QUOTH GHARIB THOU ART SAFE AND THOU SHALT BE RESTORED TO THY FATHER AND THE SEAT OF THY WORSHIP WHEREUPON SHE PRAYED THAT HE MIGHT LIVE LONG AND HAVE ADVANCEMENT IN RANK AND HONOUR
104 PLACES IN SUNDA I.E
THE FIFTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN F
FOR TO DISCOVER ONE'S SHAME IS FORBIDDEN SO I LEFT HER HER TROUSERS OUT OF PITY AND BEHOLD SHE CRIED OUT AND SAID HE HATH MADE DEFAULT
BUT YE ARE REPROBATES WHO DESERVE NO FAVOUR OF ME FOR SINCE YOUR FATHER'S DEATH I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY GOOD IN YOU
PRESENTLY THE MOOR THRUST BOTH HANDS FORTH OF THE WATER AND CALLED OUT TO HIM SAYING HO GOOD FELLOW CAST OUT THY NET SO JUDAR THREW THE NET OVER HIM AND DREW HIM ASHORE AND LO
BUT IF THOU GAINSAY HIM HE WILL SLAY THEE
WHEREAT SHE REJOICED AND THEY LAUGHING AT HIM WENT THEIR WAY
AND I SAID IN MYSELF WHEN I RETURN TO MY NATIVE LAND I WILL CARRY HER WITH ME BUT WHATSO IS PREDESTINED TO A MAN THAT NEEDS MUST BE AND NONE KNOWETH WHAT SHALL BEFAL HIM
IF I KNEW THE MONEY-FINE WHICH IS UPON HIM I WOULD PAY IT OUT OF MY OWN PURSE SO I MAY HAVE MY DESIRE OF THEE FOR THOU PLEASEST ME WITH THY SWEET SPEECH QUOTH SHE IF THOU O MY LORD DO THUS WE MUST NOT BLAME OTHERS QUOTH HE AN THOU WILT NOT COME IN WEND THY WAYS THEN SAID SHE AN THOU WILT HAVE IT SO O OUR LORD IT WILL BE PRIVIER AND BETTER IN MY PLACE THAN IN THINE FOR HERE ARE SLAVE-GIRLS AND EUNUCHS AND GOERS-IN AND COMERS-OUT AND INDEED I AM A WOMAN WHO WOTTETH NAUGHT OF THIS FASHION
THEN THE KING'S SON GAVE THE SIGNAL FOR DEPARTURE
SO I PURPOSE TO COMMIT HIS BALES OF GOODS TO THY CHARGE THAT THOU MAYST SELL THEM IN THIS ISLAND
A ROOK HERO AT CHESS
AND HE WHOSE LOT IT WAS TO SUCCEED WOULD LAY HANDS UPON THEM
OTHERS SAID NO HE'S NOT
SO I REJOICED AT HAVING REACHED SO PLEASANT A PLACE AND TOOK MY EASE THERE AFTER MY FATIGUES
FN#361 IN THE MAC
AND HIS HEART CLAVE TO IT SO HAPLY HIS DELIVERANCE MIGHT BE THEREIN
THEN HE WAITED AWHILE
FOR THE LORD IS BOUNTIFUL AND GOOD ABOUNDETH WITH ME SO HE MADE PEACE WITH THEM AND THEY SUPPED AND RIGHTED WITH HIM
DID THEY PROVIDE THEM AGAINST THE DAY OF RESURRECTION OR MAKE READY TO ANSWER THE LORD OF MEN
AND INDEED I BLAMED MYSELF AND SORE REPENTED ME OF HAVING TAKEN COMPASSION ON HIM AND CONTINUED IN THIS CONDITION SUFFERING FATIGUE NOT TO BE DESCRIBED TILL I SAID TO MYSELF I WROUGHT HIM A WEAL AND HE REQUITED ME WITH MY ILL
HAS AL-MA'ARAT LANGLèS CALLS IT THE ISLAND OF AL-KAMáRí SEE LANE III
AND AS SOON AS THE DAWN BROKE AND MORN SHONE THE RUKH ROSE OFF ITS EGG AND SPREADING ITS WINGS WITH A GREAT CRY FLEW UP INTO THE AIR DRAGGING ME WITH IT
AND THE BIRD IS A STORK
SO IT WRIGGLED ROUND ME ON EVERY SIDE WHILST I LOOKED ON LIKE ONE DEAD BY REASON OF MY TERROR
AND MAKING A BOAT MOORED IT TO THE STRAND AFTER WHICH WE STOWED THEREIN SOMEWHAT OF VICTUAL AND RETURNED TO THE CASTLE
A SIMILAR STORY IS THAT OF THE CHAPLAIN WHO WEARY OF THE SAME DIET UTTERED GRACE AS FOLLOWS RABBITS HOT RABBITS COLD RABBITS TENDER AND RABBITS TOUGH RABBITS YOUNG AND RABBITS OLD I THANK THE LORD I'VE HAD ENOUGH
BUT I HIS MAMELUKE WHOM HE HATH OVERWHELMED WITH HIS FAVOURS AND BOUNTIES DO PROFFER HIM TRUE AND LOYAL REDE
SABBAHAT I.E
AN THIS BE SO YON DAMSEL IS ASSUREDLY THE CAUSE
THEN THEY TOSSED A NET OVER THE CRAFT AND DREW IT ASHORE WITH ME WHEREUPON I FELL TO THE GROUND AMIDST THEM AS I WERE A DEAD MAN FOR STRESS OF FEAR AND HUNGER AND LACK OF SLEEP
I SAW A FIGURE OF A WOMAN PAINTED ON THE HOUSE WALL OF MY BROTHER SUCH AN ONE AND BECAME ENAMOURED OF IT HEREUPON THE OTHER FELL TO BLAMING HIM AND SAID THIS WAS OF THY LACK OF WIT
SO WE COMMITTED IT TO THIS PESTILENT OLD WOMAN THAT SHE MIGHT GIVE IT TO WHO SHOULD FINE-DRAW IT AND RETURN IT TO US
A SECTION OF THE HORN IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW WHITE LINES IN THE FIGURE OF A MAN AND SUNDRY LIKENESSES OF BIRDS
HIS FATHER WHEN ABOUT TO DIE FORBADE HIM FROM THIS BUT HE WOULD NOT BE FORBIDDEN AND HE REDOUBLED IN HIS FORWARDNESS TILL HINDI BANISHED HIM AND DROVE HIM FORTH THE LAND OF HIND AFTER BATTLES AND SORE TRAVAIL
NEVERTHELESS SáLIM AND SALíM FORBORE NOT TO SEEK HIS HURT AND TO CARRY THE CASE FROM COURT TO COURT,[FN#259 HE AND THEY LOSING TILL THEY HAD GIVEN ALL THEIR GOOD FOR FOOD TO THE OPPRESSORS AND THEY BECAME POOR ALL THREE
THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN-UP SHIPS STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES-WOOD MAKING ME A BOAT-RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM
O EMIR ANSWERED THEY IF THOU SEEK ONE WHO SHALL GUIDE THEE TO THE PLACE SUMMON THE SHAYKH ABD AL-SAMAD IBN ABD AL-KUDDúS AL SAMúDí;[FN#110 FOR HE IS A MAN OF VARIED KNOWLEDGE WHO HATH TRAVELLED MUCH AND KNOWETH BY EXPERIENCE ALL THE SEAS AND WASTES AND WORDS AND COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD AND THE INHABITANTS AND WONDERS THEREOF

NOW CONTINUED SHAHRAZAD I HAVE ANOTHER TALE TO TELL ANENT THE CRAFT AND MALICE OF WOMEN,[FN#153 OR THE TALE OF THE KING HIS SON HIS CONCUBINE AND THE SEVEN WAZIRS
THEN I BLAMED MYSELF FOR HAVING THUS RISKED MY LIFE AND SAID IF THIS PASSAGE GROW ANY STRAITER THE RAFT WILL HARDLY PASS AND I CANNOT TURN BACK
FN#242 I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THE POISON WOULD HAVE BEEN UTTERLY HARMLESS UNLESS THERE HAD BEEN AN ABRASION OF THE SKIN

HENCE AS I HAVE SAID THE DEPILATORY
THEN THEY STUFFED THEM WITH COCOA-NUT OIL AND THE AFORESAID FOOD TILL THEY BECAME FAT AND GROSS WHEN THEY SLAUGHTERED THEM BY CUTTING THEIR THROATS AND ROASTED THEM FOR THE KING'S EATING
THE SHAYKH ABD AL-SAMAD WENT VALIANTLY UP THERETO AND BY THE AID OF HIS KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL OPENED THE LOCKS WHEREUPON THE DOOR ADMITTED THEM INTO A CORRIDOR PAVED WITH MARBLE AND HUNG WITH VEIL LIKE[FN#142 TAPESTRIES EMBROIDERED WITH FIGURES OF ALL MANNER BEASTS AND BIRDS WHOSE BODIES WERE OF RED GOLD AND WHITE SILVER AND THEIR EYES OF PEARLS AND RUBIES AMAZING ALL WHO LOOKED UPON THEM

AND HE WASTED HIS SUBSTANCE IN GIFTS AND PRODIGALITY TILL HE HAD SQUANDERED ALL THE MONEY HIS FATHER LEFT HIM AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
THEN SAID THE KING COME WITH US FOR THOU ART MY GUEST SO THEY TOOK HORSE AGAIN AND RODE ON STIRRUP TOUCHING STIRRUP IN GREAT AND STATELY PROCESSION CONVERSING AS THEY WENT TILL THEY CAME TO THE ROYAL PALACE WHERE THEY ALIGHTED TOGETHER.--AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
NOR DID I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A BELVEDERE THERE THEN HE AROSE FORTHRIGHT AND GOING IN SEARCHED THE BY WAYS OF THE HOUSE TILL HE ESPIED IN A WALL CORNER AMONG THE TREES A NARROW DOOR BETWEEN WHOSE POSTS[FN#226 THE SPIDER HAD WOVEN HER WEBS AND SAID IN HIMSELF HAPLY THE SPIDER HATH NOT WEBBED OVER THE DOOR BUT BECAUSE DEATH AND DOOM IS WITHIN HOWEVER HE HEARTENED HIMSELF WITH THE SAYING OF GOD THE MOST HIGH SAY NOTHING SHALL BEFALL US BUT WHAT ALLAH HATH WRITTEN FOR US;"[FN#227 AND OPENING THE DOOR ASCENDED A NARROW FLIGHT OF STAIRS TILL HE CAME TO THE TERRACE ROOF WHERE HE FOUND A BELVEDERE IN WHICH HE SAT DOWN TO REST AND SOLACE HIMSELF WITH THE VIEW
NOW THE ISLAND SARANDIB LIETH UNDER THE EQUINOCTIAL LINE ITS NIGHT AND DAY BOTH NUMBERING TWELVE HOUSE
HE ESPIED A GREAT SMOKE RISING UP TO HEAVEN AND TAKING FRIGHT HE CLIMBED UP INTO A TREE AND HID HIMSELF AMONG THE BRANCHES

QUOTH THE HOST THOU ART WELCOME AND THY DAY IS A BLESSED
HENCE LOT AND MOSES SAT AND STOOD IN THE GATE AND HERE MAN SPEAKS WITH HIS ENEMIES

MY STORY IS A WONDROUS AND MY ADVENTURES MARVELLOUS AND THE MANNER OF MY COMING HITHER IS PRODIGIOUS
NOR DID HE VISIT THE PRINCE SAVE EVERY THIRD DAY WHEN HE LESSONED HIM ON THE KNOWLEDGE TO BE EXTRACTED FROM THE WALL-PICTURES AND RENEWED HIS PROVISION OF MEAT AND DRINK AFTER WHICH HE LEFT HIM AGAIN TO SOLITUDE
AND HE TOLD US HIS NAME SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND HOW THE SHIP LEFT HIM ON THE DESERT ISLAND
AND HE AND HIS BROTHERS ARRAYED THEMSELVES IN THE ROBES THE JINNI HAD BROUGHT THEM AND JUDAR BECAME LIKE UNTO A KING AND HIS BROTHERS AS WAZIRS
FOR MOHAMMED'S SEE AL-BUSIRI'S MANTLE-POEM VV
SO THEY DREW THEIR SWORDS AND RAN TO SLAY THE SLAVE
KNOW O MY BRETHREN THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY THIRD VOYAGE AND FOREGATHERING WITH MY FRIENDS AND FORGETTING ALL MY PERILS AND HARDSHIPS IN THE ENJOYMENT OF EASE AND COMFORT AND REPOSE I WAS VISITED ONE DAY BY A COMPANY OF MERCHANTS WHO SAT DOWN WITH ME AND TALKED OF FOREIGN TRAVEL AND TRAFFIC TILL THE OLD BAD MAN WITHIN ME YEARNED TO GO WITH THEM AND ENJOY THE SIGHT OF STRANGE COUNTRIES AND I LONGED FOR THE SOCIETY OF THE VARIOUS RACES OF MANKIND AND FOR TRAFFIC AND PROFIT
MOREOVER THERE WAS A WONDROUS RARETY A MARVELLOUS CUP OF CRYSTAL MIDDLEMOST OF WHICH WAS THE FIGURE OF A LION FACED BY A KNEELING MAN GRASPING A BOW WITH ARROW DRAWN TO THE VERY HEAD TOGETHER WITH THE FOOD-TRAY[FN#100 OF SULAYMAN THE SON OF DAVID ON WHOM BE PEACE THE MISSIVE RAN AS FOLLOWS PEACE FROM KING AL-RASHID THE AIDED OF ALLAH WHO HATH VOUCHSAFED TO HIM AND HIS FOREFATHERS NOBLE RANK AND WIDE SPREAD GLORY BE ON THE FORTUNATE SULTAN

BUT JUDAR WITH ALL HIS GOODNESS PROVED HIMSELF AN ARRANT SOFTY AND WAS NO MATCH FOR TWO ATROCIOUS VILLAINS

FN#358 ELLIPTICAL HE RODE OUT IN GREAT STATE THAT IS TO SAY IF GREATNESS CAN TRULY BE ATTRIBUTED TO MAN FOR ETC
NOR CAN MAN PREVENT THAT WHICH IS FORE-ORDAINED OF FATE
I THOUGHT THEE CHASTE AND PURE TILL I SAW THEE WITH MY OWN EYES IN THIS OLD WOMAN'S COMPANY AND KNEW THAT THOU DIDST FREQUENT LOOSE BAGGAGES SO SAYING SHE FELL TO BEATING HIM WITH HER SLIPPER ABOUT THE HEAD AND CRYING OUT DIVORCE ME
INDEED THERE WAS ENOUGH IN THESE TREASURES AND GREED OF GAIN ASSUREDLY DEGRADETH A MAN THEN HE BADE ADMIT THE TROOPS
AND QUOTH I HE WILL NOT CONSENT TO THAT
RATHER DO THOU TAKE UP THINE ABODE WITH ME AND THE SCONE I EAT I WILL SHARE WITH THEE
WILT THOU DO IT SO I KISSED HIS HAND AND ASKED HIM SAYING O MY LORD WHAT OCCASION HATH THE MASTER FOR THE SLAVE

DO THOU INTERCEDE FOR US O OUR MOTHER AND SHE SAID TO THEM O MY SONS FEAR NOTHING THEN SAID JUDAR TO THE SERVANT I COMMAND THEE TO BRING ME ALL THAT IS IN THE KING'S TREASURY OF GOODS AND SUCH

SO I GAVE MYSELF UP FOR LOST AND SAID NOT ALWAYS DOTH THE CROCK ESCAPE THE SHOCK
THERE WAS ONCE A MAN WHICH WAS A FULLER AND HE USED EVERY DAY TO GO FORTH TO THE TIGRIS-BANK A-CLEANING CLOTHES

SO THEY RESIGNED THEMSELVES TO FORE-ORDAINED FATE AND FORTUNE AND I SUBMITTED TO THE JUDGMENT OF ALLAH ENDURING PATIENTLY THAT WHICH HE DECREED UNTO ME OF AFFLICTION TILL HE TOOK MY SOUL AND MADE ME TO DWELL IN MY GRAVE
SUCH AT LEAST IS THE PLEASANT COLLECTION OF NINETEENTH CENTURY NOVELETTES PUBLISHED UNDER THAT DESIGNATION BY MR ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON CHATTO AND WINDUS PICCADILLY 1884

SIR JOHN MANDEVILLE IF SUCH PERSON EVER EXISTED MENTIONS MEN FIFTY FEET HIGH IN THE INDIAN ISLANDS

SO BE ON THY GUARD AGAINST HIM BY REASON OF THIS THY VISION WHEN AJIB HEARD THEIR WORDS HE SAID I HAVE NO BROTHER WHOM I SHOULD FEAR
BUT WHEN SHE RETURNED HOME AND SETTING IT BEFORE HER HUSBAND WENT FOR A COOKING-POT HE FOUND IN IT EARTH AND STONES
WE FLED FROM HIM RIGHT AND LEFT AND HE SAW US NOT FOR HIS SIGHT WAS ALTOGETHER BLENT
AND A SWORD HAVE I WHEN MY RIGHT HAND WIELDS DEATH HASTENS FROM LEFT ON MANKIND TO ALIGHT
BUT GIRD THYSELF FOR BATTLE
I CALLED TO THE RAIS AND CREW PUT OUT TO SEA AND SEEK SAFETY IN FLIGHT BEFORE WE BE ALL DESTROYED SO THE MERCHANTS CAME ON BOARD AND WE CAST OFF AND MADE HASTE FROM THE ISLAND TO GAIN THE OPEN SEA
AFTER WHICH I GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THE COLLARS AND NECKLACES OF PEARLS AND JEWELS AND TRINKETS OF GOLD AND SILVER SET WITH PRECIOUS STONES AND OTHER ORNAMENTS AND VALUABLES I COULD FIND UPON THE CORPSES
BUT WE WERE TOLD BY THE NEIGHBOURING ISLANDERS AND BY TRAVELLERS THAT THE INHABITANTS ARE PEOPLE OF DILIGENCE AND JUDGMENT.[FN#16 IN THIS SEA I SAW ALSO A FISH TWO HUNDRED CUBITS LONG AND THE FISHERMEN FEAR IT
AND GREAT IS THE LOVE WE BEAR FOR THEE IN HEART
THEN HE ENTERED THE HALL OF THE TREASURES WHERE HE SAW GOLD LYING IN HEAPS BUT PAID NO HEED TO IT AND PASSED ON TO THE CLOSET AT THE UPPER END WHERE HE SAW THE ENCHANTER AL-SHAMARDAL LYING ON A COUCH OF GOLD BALDRICK'D WITH THE SWORD WITH THE RING ON HIS FINGER THE KOHL PHIAL ON HIS BREAST AND THE CELESTIAL PLANISPHERE HANGING OVER HIS HEAD
NOR DID HE CEASE TO FEEL AND TURN OVER THE REST OF US ONE AFTER ANOTHER TILL HE CAME TO THE MASTER OF THE SHIP
BUT HERODOTUS EVIDENTLY REFERS TO ONE GOD WHEN HE MAKES THE ARABS WORSHIP DIONYSUS AS GREEK LETTERS AND URANIA AS GREEK LETTERS AND THE TASHDID IN ALLáT WOULD TO A GREEK EAR INTRODUCE ANOTHER SYLLABLE ALILAT THIS WAS THE GODDESS OF THE KURAYSH AND THAKíF WHOSE TEMPLE AT TAíF WAS CIRCUITED LIKE THE KA'ABAH BEFORE MOHAMMED DESTROYED IT
AND I APPLIED MYSELF TO ALL MANNER JOYS AND SOLACES AND DELIGHTS EATING THE DANTIEST VIANDS AND DRINKING THE DELICIOUSEST WINES
WHEN IT REACHED THE SMALL INNER PORT WHERE SHIPS ANCHOR UNDER THE CITY THE MASTER FURLED HIS SAILS AND MAKING FAST TO THE SHORE PUT OUT THE LANDING-PLANKS WHEREUPON THE CREW FELL TO BREAKING BULK AND LANDING CARGO WHILST I STOOD BY TAKING WRITTEN NOTE OF THEM
AND WHEN THE MAGHRIBI CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM HE SALUTED HIM AND ASKED HIM OF HIS STATE
HENCE BIRKAT FAR'AUN IN THE SUEZ GULF

FOR I HAVE NO OCCASION TO BUY FROM THE MARKET NOR NEED I ANY TO COOK

THEN SHE STOOD AFAR OFF BUSYING HERSELF IN HIS SERVICE AND SAID TO HIM O OUR LORD WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THY GRACIOUS COMING
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE VALLEY THEY FOUND IT BEAUTIFUL EXCEEDINGLY AND PASSING ALL DEGREE
ALL ARE THE EASTERN FORM OF GAVARNI'S ENFANTS TERRIBLES SHOWING THE PORTENTOUS PRECOCITY FOR WHICH SOME CHILDREN INFANT PHENOMENA CALCULATING BOYS ETC
AND THE TWO SLAVES FOUGHT THEIR BEST
THEN HE SHOWED THEM TO JUDAR WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THEM AND SAID BRING FOR EACH A DRESS OF THE FINEST READY REPLIED THE SERVANT
WATER-MELONS ARE SERVED UP RAW CUT INTO SQUARE MOUTHFULS TO BE EATEN WITH RICE AND MEAT
WHEN HIS WIFE WAS WARE OF HIM SHE HURRIED THE PRINCE BACK INTO THE CHEST BUT IN HER CONFUSION FORGOT TO LOCK IT
AS I LAY WONDERING AT THIS LO
I HELD ON TO THE RAFT FOR FEAR OF FALLING OFF IT WHILST THE WAVES TOSSED ME RIGHT AND LEFT
AND MY WEALTH ALLOWED THIS STATE OF THINGS TO ENDURE
WOULD HEAVEN I KNEW HOW I SHALL WIN FREE OF THIS AFFAIR FOR MY WITS ARE CLEAN GONE THEN HE DESCENDED FROM THE TERRACE PONDERING HIS CASE AND SAT DOWN IN THE HOUSE BUT BEING UNABLE TO REST HE WENT OUT AND TOOK HIS SEAT AT THE DOOR ABSORBED IN MELANCHOLY THOUGHT WHEN BEHOLD UP CAME THE OLD WOMAN AFOOT PRAISING AND MAGNIFYING ALLAH AS SHE WENT
THEN COMING TO HIMSELF HE ENTERED THE PAVILION AND SAW THEREIN A LONG TOMB AWESOME TO LOOK UPON WHEREON WAS A TABLET OF CHINA STEEL AND SHAYKH ABD AL-SAMAD DREW NEAR IT AND READ THIS INSCRIPTION
QUOTH THE KING I EXCUSE HER AND IN MY SON'S HANDS BE HER DOOM
THEN I TOOK THE LEG BONE OF A DEAD MAN AND GOING UP TO THE WOMAN SMOTE HER ON THE CROWN OF THE HEAD
FN#113 I RETAIN THIS VENERABLE BLUNDER
IN ONE POINT THIS WORLD-FAMOUS TALE IS BADLY ORDERED
BUT FROM THAT TIME WE HAVE NEVER SET EYES ON HER AGAIN TILL THIS DAY ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN THIS YOUNG MAN SPEAKS SOOTH
JUDAR STOOD WAITING SOME TIME TILL BEHOLD THE MOOR'S FEET APPEARED ABOVE THE WATER WHEREUPON HE KNEW THAT HE WAS DEAD
THE PERSIAN SINDIBáD-NáMAH ASSUMED ITS PRESENT SHAPE IN A.D
AND IF EVER I REFUSED TO DO HIS BIDDING OR LOITERED OR TOOK MY LEISURE HE BEAT ME WITH HIS FEET MORE GRIEVOUSLY THAN IF I HAD BEEN BEATEN WITH WHIPS
WHEN IS WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-FORTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE FAVOURITE HAD TOLD HER TALE TO THE KING SHE SAID I BESEECH THEE TO DO ME JUSTICE BY PUTTING THY SON TO DEATH NOW THIS WAS THE FOURTH DAY SO THE FOURTH WAZIR ENTERED AND KISSING THE GROUND BEFORE HIM SAID ALLAH STABLISH AND PROTECT THE KING
THE PARTY FARED ON DILIGENTLY NOW PASSING THROUGH INHABITED LANDS THEN RUINS AND ANON TRAVERSING FRIGHTFUL WORDS AND THIRSTY WASTES AND THEN MOUNTAINS WHICH SPIRED HIGH IN AIR
DO THOU PRAY FOR ME AND ALLAH WILL GIVE ME THE MEANS OF THINE ALIMONY
I GIVE HER TO THEE TO WIFE AND I AM THY SLAVE SAID AJIB I DESIRE TO LOOK UPON THIS SON OF AN ADULTERESS GHARIB THAT I MAY DESTROY HIM AND CAUSE HIM TASTE ALL MANNER OF TORMENTS THEN HE BADE GIVE MARDAS TO HIS DAUGHTER'S DOWRY THIRTY THOUSAND DINARS AND AN HUNDRED PIECES OF SILK-BROCADED AND FRINGED WITH GOLD AND AN HUNDRED PIECES OF SILK BORDERED STUFFS AND KERCHIEFS AND GOLDEN COLLARS
WHERETO SHE ANSWERED MY HUSBAND QUOTH HE HOW SHALL I DO QUOTH SHE DRAW THY SWORD AND STAND IN THE VESTIBULE AND ABUSE ME AND REVILE ME
AS SOON AS I FOUND MYSELF ON THE HARD GROUND I MADE HASTE TO UNBIND MYSELF QUAKING FOR FEAR OF THE BIRD THOUGH IT TOOK NO HEED OF ME NOR EVEN FELT ME
SUCH THEN IS THE HISTORY OF MY FIFTH VOYAGE AND ITS WONDERMENTS AND NOW TO SUPPER
AND AL-KAZWINI AND AL IDRISI TRANSFER THEM TO THE SEA OF CHINA A BOTANY BAY FOR MONSTERS IN GENERAL
SO I MADE MYSELF A PLACE IN A CAVITY OF THE CAVERN AFAR FROM THE CORPSES LATELY THROWN DOWN AND THERE SLEPT
BUT ON THE FIFTH DAY THE DAMSEL CAME IN TO HIM HENDING A BOWL OF POISON IN HAND CALLING ON HEAVEN FOR HELP AND BUFFETING HER CHEEKS AND FACE AND SAID TO HIM O KING EITHER THOU SHALT DO ME JUSTICE AND AVENGE ME ON THY SON OR I WILL DRINK UP THIS POISON-CUP AND DIE AND THE SIN OF MY BLOOD SHALL BE ON THY HEAD AT THE DAY OF DOOM
BUT THIS WOULD NOT BE A SPECIOSUM MIRACULUM
BUT THE KING COULD NOT TAKE HIS FILL OF LOOKING UPON HIM

SAID THE MERCHANT PLUCK OUT THINE EYE AND I WILL PLUCK OUT MINE
A WHITE DEATH IS QUIET AND NATURAL WITH FORGIVENESS OF SINS

ONE DAY THE CURRIER SET A TRAP FOR HIM AND TAKING HIM BEAT HIM WITH THE HIDES TILL HE FELL DOWN SENSELESS WHEREUPON THE MAN DEEMING HIM TO BE DEAD CAST HIM OUT INTO THE ROAD BY THE CITY-GATE

THEN WE WILL WEIGH THEM BOTH AND IF THINE EYE BE OF THE SAME WEIGHT AS MINE THOU SAYEST SOOTH IN WHAT THOU AVOUCHEST SO WILT THOU OWE HIM THE LEGAL PRICE OF HIS EYE AND BE STONE BLIND WHILST HE WILL STILL SEE WITH HIS OTHER EYE SO THE SHARPER KNEW THAT THE MERCHANT MIGHT BAFFLE HIM WITH SUCH PLEA

WHEREUPON WE LOST THE POWER OF THOUGHT AND REASON AND WERE STUPEFIED FOR THE EXCESS OF OUR FEAR AND HORROR

WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK SAW HIS ARMY ENCAMPED BEFORE IT THEY BOLTED THE GATES AND MANNED THE WALLS THEN WENT TO THE KING OF THE CITY WHO WAS CALLED AL-DáMIGH THE BRAINER FOR THAT HE USED TO BRAIN THE CHAMPIONS IN THE OPEN FIELD OF FIGHT AND TOLD HIM WHAT WAS COME UPON THEM
