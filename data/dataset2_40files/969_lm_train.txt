BUT LET ME CHERISH STILL THE HOPE WITH WHICH I CANNOT PART
AND DID YOU NEVER MILLY OBSERVE THE SANDS ON THE SEA-SHORE
BUT HE'LL CHANGE AGAIN WHEN HE'S SICK OF HER
HOWEVER PRAY DO ME ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN IF YOU DO REALLY FIND ANY PLEASURE IN IT
I LIKE YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE I AM ALONE HERE AND YOUR CONVERSATION PLEASES ME MORE THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER PERSON
NOT LONG I ANSWERED
NO REPLIED I BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU COMFORTABLE BEFORE I GO ME COMFORTABLE REPEATED SHE WITH A BITTER LAUGH AS IF THERE WERE SOMETHING AMUSINGLY ABSURD IN THE IDEA
I HAVE SAID ENOUGH I THINK TO CONVINCE YOU THAT I DID WELL TO GO TO HIM POOR POOR HELEN
SHE HAD NOT HEARD OF THE INJURY HE HAD SUSTAINED AT MY HANDS
BUT HE HAD NOT POWER TO FORM THE LETTERS
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE FEELINGS IN YOUR NATURE THAT HAVE NEVER YET BEEN CALLED FORTH
IT WAS JUST SUCH WEATHER AS YESTERDAY
THERE WAS PLENTY OF SKILL AND EXECUTION BUT PRECIOUS LITTLE FEELING
I HAVE A VERY PLEASANT RECOLLECTION OF THAT WALK ALONG THE HARD WHITE SUNNY ROAD SHADED HERE AND THERE WITH BRIGHT GREEN TREES AND ADORNED WITH FLOWERY BANKS AND BLOSSOMING HEDGES OF DELICIOUS FRAGRANCE
BUT DROWNING MEN CATCH AT STRAWS
AND I IN RETURN WAS VERY FOND OF HER
WORDS WITH HIM ARE SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN DEEDS
IN THE SECOND PLACE I WAS CONTINUALLY STRAINING TO SATISFY HIS SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS AND DO HONOUR TO HIS CHOICE BY MY GENERAL CONDUCT AND DEPORTMENT AND FEARING TO DISAPPOINT HIM BY SOME AWKWARD MISDEMEANOUR OR SOME TRAIT OF INEXPERIENCED IGNORANCE ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF SOCIETY ESPECIALLY WHEN I ACTED THE PART OF HOSTESS WHICH I WAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY CALLED UPON TO DO
ALL THE HINTS AND AFFIRMATIONS OF OTHERS I TREATED AS MALIGNANT BASELESS SLANDERS
WE HAD LEFT GRASSDALE MANY MILES BEHIND US BEFORE THE ROUND RED SUN AROSE TO WELCOME OUR DELIVERANCE
I WAS COLD-HEARTED HARD INSENSATE
AND FINALLY HATTERSLEY RUSHED UPON HIM IN A FRENZY AND SEIZING HIM BY THE SHOULDERS GAVE HIM A VIOLENT SHAKING UNDER WHICH HE LAUGHED AND SHRIEKED ALARMINGLY
I DON'T ALLOW THAT
OH MR MARKHAM SAID SHE WITH A SHOCKED EXPRESSION AND VOICE SUBDUED ALMOST TO A WHISPER WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE SHOCKING REPORTS ABOUT MRS GRAHAM?--CAN YOU ENCOURAGE US TO DISBELIEVE THEM WHAT REPORTS AH NOW
WE LEFT TOWN SOONER THAN WAS INTENDED IN CONSEQUENCE OF MY UNCLE'S INDISPOSITION;--I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULT IF WE HAD STAYED THE FULL TIME
FOR HE HAD LATELY FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE VICAR OF L--'S ELDEST DAUGHTER--A LADY WHOSE SUPERIORITY HAD ROUSED HIS LATENT VIRTUES AND STIMULATED HIM TO THE MOST SURPRISING EXERTIONS NOT ONLY TO GAIN HER AFFECTION AND ESTEEM AND TO OBTAIN A FORTUNE SUFFICIENT TO ASPIRE TO HER HAND BUT TO RENDER HIMSELF WORTHY OF HER IN HIS OWN EYES AS WELL AS IN THOSE OF HER PARENTS
AND THAT UNLESS YOU COULD APPROVE AND HONOUR AND RESPECT YOU COULD NOT LOVE YES
I WILL LEAVE BETTER MEN TO THOSE WHO ONLY CONSIDER THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE
IN SPITE OF EARTH AND HELL I SHOULD HAVE STRENGTH FOR ALL MY TRIALS AND WIN A GLORIOUS REST AT LAST
AND WHY DID YOU NEVER MENTION IT BEFORE IT IS ONLY A LITTLE BUSINESS WITH MY LAWYER SAID HE
I KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO MAKE MATTERS STRAIGHT
THEY TELL LIES YES MUM SAID SHE QUIETLY AS SHE WENT ON ARRANGING MY HAIR
THE SCENES OF HUNTINGDON'S WICKEDNESS ARE LESS INTERESTING BUT LESS IMPROBABLE THAN THE COUNTRY-HOUSE SCENES OF JANE EYRE
IT WAS A MOMENT OF PAINFUL EMBARRASSMENT TO ME AND I THOUGHT IT MUST BE INFINITELY MORE SO TO HER
CHAPTER XIII MY DEAR GILBERT I WISH YOU WOULD TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE AMIABLE SAID MY MOTHER ONE MORNING AFTER SOME DISPLAY OF UNJUSTIFIABLE ILL-HUMOUR ON MY PART
AND I TOO HAVE FRIENDS WHOSE PEACE OF MIND SHALL NEVER BE SACRIFICED TO MY ENJOYMENT OR YOURS EITHER WITH MY CONSENT
AND WE LIVED IN THE GREATEST HARMONY WITH OUR DEAR AUNT UNTIL THE DAY OF HER DEATH WHICH MELANCHOLY EVENT TOOK PLACE A FEW YEARS AFTER--MELANCHOLY NOT TO HERSELF FOR IT CAME QUIETLY UPON HER AND SHE WAS GLAD TO REACH HER JOURNEY'S END BUT ONLY TO THE FEW LOVING FRIENDS AND GRATEFUL DEPENDENTS SHE LEFT BEHIND
I SHALL HAVE SO MUCH MORE PLEASURE IN MY LABOUR MY EARNINGS MY FRUGAL FARE AND HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY WHEN I KNOW THAT I AM PAYING MY WAY HONESTLY AND THAT WHAT LITTLE I POSSESS IS LEGITIMATELY ALL MY OWN
INDEED I BELIEVE SHE WILL NOT PUT HERSELF TO THE EXPENSE OF TAKING ME UP TO LONDON AGAIN UNLESS I SURRENDER
AND THEN THAT FRIGHTENS HER A LITTLE
AND I WENT OUT TO ENJOY IT IN A QUIET RAMBLE IN COMPANY WITH MY OWN BLISSFUL THOUGHTS
AND WERE THEY HONOURABLE HE WOULD NOT BE SO ANXIOUS TO CONCEAL THEM
MY HEART TELLS ME IT IS NOT
AND WHY SHOULD I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT MY SON WILL BE ONE IN A THOUSAND?--AND NOT RATHER PREPARE FOR THE WORST AND SUPPOSE HE WILL BE LIKE HIS--LIKE THE REST OF MANKIND UNLESS I TAKE CARE TO PREVENT IT YOU ARE VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO US ALL I OBSERVED
THAT COULD NOT KILL HIM IF HE LAY THERE HALF THE DAY
AND BESIDES HE IS OF A SANGUINE TEMPERAMENT AND A GAY THOUGHTLESS TEMPER AND I AM NATURALLY INCLINED TO REFLECTION WELL NOW YOU HAVE MADE HIM OUT TO BE DEFICIENT IN BOTH SENSE AND PRINCIPLE BY YOUR OWN CONFESSION THEN MY SENSE AND MY PRINCIPLE ARE AT HIS SERVICE THAT SOUNDS PRESUMPTUOUS HELEN
WHAT COULD BE THE MATTER WITH HIM
HE STAYED AWAY SOME TEN OR TWELVE DAYS
AND LIBERTY AND HOPE BEFORE
BUT THAT WAS NO MATTER TO MY LITTLE NAMESAKE
FRIENDS AS WE ARE WE WOULD WILLINGLY KEEP YOUR FAILINGS TO OURSELVES--EVEN FROM OURSELVES IF WE COULD UNLESS BY KNOWING THEM WE COULD DELIVER YOU FROM THEM WELL WELL
I CANNOT GET OVER MY DISLIKE TO LADY LOWBOROUGH
HOWEVER I THOUGHT OF MY ASYLUM IN SHIRE AND MADE NO FURTHER OBJECTIONS
PANTING WITH EAGERNESS AND STRUGGLING TO SUPPRESS MY HOPES I HURRIED HOME AND RUSHED UP-STAIRS TO MY ROOM HAVING FIRST PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A CANDLE THOUGH IT WAS SCARCELY TWILIGHT YET--THEN SHUT AND BOLTED THE DOOR DETERMINED TO TOLERATE NO INTERRUPTION
IF FAITH WOULD NEVER FAIL NOW THEN EXCLAIMED SHE WHILE THIS HOPE IS STRONG WITHIN US WE WILL PART I CRIED
IS YOUR SISTER GONE WERE MY FIRST WORDS AS I GRASPED HIS HAND INSTEAD OF THE USUAL INQUIRY AFTER HIS HEALTH
MY VISION CLEARED
IT WILL BE READY IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HE REJECTED THE OFFER WITH A MAJESTIC WAVE OF THE HAND
YOU DID RIGHT TO LEAVE THEM LORD LOWBOROUGH SAID I
I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO CONCEAL IT FROM MY AUNT
I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD CALL THESE VENIAL ERRORS NOR DO I AUNT
IN THE SECOND PLACE THE UNOCCUPIED APARTMENTS WHICH I DON'T PAY FOR MAY SERVE AS LUMBER-ROOMS IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO PUT IN THEM
ON SEEING ME ENTER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY HARGRAVE HE LEERED AT ME WITH A GLANCE OF INTOLERABLE SIGNIFICANCE AS I PASSED
BUT IF HE INTENDED THE SPEECH TO BE HAILED AS A MASTER-STROKE OF WIT HE SIGNALLY FAILED FOR NOBODY LAUGHED
AT MINE IT'S SOLID SERVICEABLE GOLD
AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENT CONTEMPLATION I WAS BEGINNING TO COMMENT ON ITS BEAUTIES AND PECULIARITIES WHEN PLAYFULLY PRESSING THE HAND HE STILL RETAINED WITHIN HIS ARM HE INTERRUPTED ME WITH,--'NEVER MIND THE PICTURE
I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR CALLING YOU OUT ON SUCH A LOVELY EVENING THOUGH IT BE FOR A MATTER OF NO GREATER IMPORTANCE TELL HIM TO COME IN MAMMA SAID ARTHUR
HE WOULD NOT STAY ABOVE A FORTNIGHT
BUT THAT WAS NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD RESTRAIN HER TONGUE OR CURB HER CHEERFUL SPIRITS
I HARDLY KNEW WHAT I SAID
LET ME BEAR IT ALONE
I NEVER HEARD IT TILL ELIZA TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY,--BUT IF ALL THE PARISH DINNED IT IN MY EARS I SHOULDN'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT--I KNOW MRS GRAHAM TOO WELL QUITE RIGHT MISS MILLWARD!--AND SO DO I--WHATEVER IT MAY BE WELL OBSERVED ELIZA WITH A GENTLE SIGH IT'S WELL TO HAVE SUCH A COMFORTABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE WORTH OF THOSE WE LOVE
HOWEVER THAT BE I WAS RENDERED DOUBLY MISERABLE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY
I LOOKED OVER THE GATE AND CALLED HIM TO ME
I HATE ENIGMAS WELL YOU KNOW I DON'T VOUCH FOR THE TRUTH OF IT--INDEED FAR FROM IT--BUT HAVEN'T YOU HEARD I'VE HEARD NOTHING EXCEPT FROM YOU YOU MUST BE WILFULLY DEAF THEN FOR ANYONE WILL TELL YOU THAT
FROM THE ANGUISH OF SUPPRESSED EMOTIONS INTENSE AND FRUITLESS LONGINGS SILENT SORROW CRUSHED HOPES AND TRAMPLED AFFECTIONS I HAVE SUFFERED MORE THAN I CAN TELL OR YOU IMAGINE--AND YOU WERE THE CAUSE OF IT AND NOT ALTOGETHER THE INNOCENT CAUSE
DON'T YOU ENVY ME DEAR NO LOVE SAID I--'OR HIM EITHER I MENTALLY ADDED
WHILE I HE BURST INTO TEARS
AMONG THE REST FOR SUNDRY DEPARTURES FROM WOODFORD AND ABSENCES MORE OR LESS PROLONGED FOR WHICH HE NEVER SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED AND CONCERNING WHICH HE HATED TO BE QUESTIONED ON HIS RETURN
SO I CROSSED THE FIELD TO MEET THEM
IF YOU PERSIST I MUST REGARD YOU AS MY DEADLIEST FOE BUT HEAR ME A MOMENT NO SIR
THE OTHERS STAYED ON FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS LONGER
A COOL REVIVING BREEZE BLEW FROM THE SEA--SOFT PURE SALUBRIOUS
AND NOW THAT SHE WAS GONE ELIZA'S PLAYFUL NONSENSE CEASED TO AMUSE ME--NAY GREW WEARISOME TO MY SOUL AND I GREW WEARY OF AMUSING HER
I RELEASED HIM FROM MY ARMS AND NEVER WERE MORE BITTER TEARS THAN THOSE THAT NOW CONCEALED HIM FROM MY BLINDED BURNING EYES
BY THE BRIGHT AZURE OF THE SKY AND BY THE WARM AND BRILLIANT LIGHTS AND DEEP LONG SHADOWS I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO CONVEY THE IDEA OF A SUNNY MORNING
AND I SHOULD KNOW BY MR WILMOT'S THAT HE WAS A WORTHLESS OLD REPROBATE
I THOUGHT THIS FOLLY
DON'T BOAST BUT WATCH
I WAS NOT GOING TO DO MORE CONTINUED SHE SMILING SO LONG AS YOU CONTINUED TO RESTRICT YOURSELF TO A FEW POLITE INQUIRIES ABOUT MY HEALTH YOUR BROTHER NEVER TOLD ME THAT YOU HAD MENTIONED MY NAME DID YOU EVER ASK HIM NO
AND IN THE INTERIM MY SON COULD NOT BE MUCH MORE INJURED THAN HE WAS ALREADY
AND IF YOU MARRY HER GILBERT YOU'LL BREAK MY HEART--SO THERE'S AN END OF IT WELL DON'T CRY ABOUT IT MOTHER SAID I FOR THE TEARS WERE GUSHING FROM HER EYES
BESIDES IT SAVES MONEY
MY HOPES DIMINISHED BUT NOT DEPARTED
BUT HE AS WELL AS MISSED HIS AIM AND THE LATTER STILL SAT COLLAPSED AND QUAKING WITH FEEBLE LAUGHTER WITH TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS FACE
AND I SAW NO MORE OF HIM TILL DINNER
SO LET ME IMPLORE YOU NOT TO CONDEMN ME TO ETERNAL WRETCHEDNESS
BUT THEY WERE ALMOST AS GOOD AS ALONE FOR I WAS NOW STANDING AT THE WINDOW WATCHING THE CLOUDS AND STRUGGLING TO SUPPRESS MY WRATH
WE ARE JUST NOW LOOKING FORWARD TO THE ADVENT OF YOU AND ROSE FOR THE TIME OF YOUR ANNUAL VISIT DRAWS NIGH WHEN YOU MUST LEAVE YOUR DUSTY SMOKY NOISY TOILING STRIVING CITY FOR A SEASON OF INVIGORATING RELAXATION AND SOCIAL RETIREMENT WITH US
I WILL EXACT NO MORE HEARTLESS CARESSES FROM YOU NOR OFFER NOR ENDURE THEM EITHER
OR THROUGH PLEASANT FIELDS AND LANES ALL GLORIOUS IN THE SWEET FLOWERS AND BRILLIANT VERDURE OF DELIGHTFUL MAY
WHY WERE THEY ALONE
THERE NOW SAID SHE PLAYFULLY RUNNING HER FINGERS OVER THE KEYS WHEN SHE HAD CONCLUDED THE SECOND SONG
TO SEE SUCH THINGS DONE WITH THE ROGUISH NAIVETE OF THAT PRETTY LITTLE CHILD AND HEAR SUCH THINGS SPOKEN BY THAT SMALL INFANTILE VOICE WAS AS PECULIARLY PIQUANT AND IRRESISTIBLY DROLL TO THEM AS IT WAS INEXPRESSIBLY DISTRESSING AND PAINFUL TO ME
WELL I ONLY TELL THE TALE AS TWAS TOLD TO ME I DON'T VOUCH FOR THE TRUTH OF IT
IF YOU COULD OVERWHELM ME WITH REMORSE AND CONFUSION OF FACE NOW'S THE TIME
SO SET YOUR MIND AT REST I HOPE IT MAY BE SO ANSWERED SHE
THERE WAS ONE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN THAT ANNOYED ME VERY MUCH
I FREQUENTLY SAW HIM SMILING TO HIMSELF AT HER ARTFUL MANOEUVRES
AND I CANNOT LIVE UNDER YOUR DISPLEASURE THEN GO AND SIN NO MORE REPLIED I TURNING AWAY
IT IS THIS RESUMED HE
I HAVE SHARED BUT LITTLE OF MR HUNTINGDON'S SOCIETY FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS
IF HE WOULD PLAY THE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN AND ATTEND TO THE FARM--BUT THAT HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT AND WON'T GIVE HIS MIND TO CONSIDER,--OR IF HE WOULD TAKE UP WITH SOME LITERARY STUDY OR LEARN TO DRAW OR TO PLAY--AS HE IS SO FOND OF MUSIC I OFTEN TRY TO PERSUADE HIM TO LEARN THE PIANO BUT HE IS FAR TOO IDLE FOR SUCH AN UNDERTAKING
CHAPTER XL JANUARY 10TH 1827.--WHILE WRITING THE ABOVE YESTERDAY EVENING I SAT IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
DO WRITE TO ME AND SAY ALL YOU CAN TO ENCOURAGE ME
WHEN I TOLD MILICENT OF MY ENGAGEMENT SHE RATHER PROVOKED ME BY HER MANNER OF TAKING IT
I TOLD YOU TO HOLD YOUR NOISE FIRST YOU KNOW FERGUS SAID I
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT A WHOLE DAY SHOULD PASS AND NO ONE TRAVERSE THE ROAD BUT OURSELVES
FOR I'D RATHER BE AN OLD MAID AND A PAUPER THAN MRS WILMOT AND MRS HUNTINGDON
AND I MUST PRAY AND STRUGGLE LONG ERE I SUBDUE IT
YOU NEEDN'T SMILE SIR SAID I STILL TIGHTENING MY GRASP AND LOOKING STEADFASTLY ON HIM TILL HE ALMOST QUAILED BEFORE ME
AND WHAT THE DEUCE ARE YOU HERE FOR IN THE DARK
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD ABOUT HER.--YOU SEE WHAT IT IS FOR WOMEN TO AFFECT TO BE DIFFERENT TO OTHER PEOPLE AND ONCE IT WAS,--'I MISDOUBTED THAT APPEARANCE OF MYSTERY FROM THE VERY FIRST--I THOUGHT THERE WOULD NO GOOD COME OF IT
THIS ASSUMPTION OF BROTHERLY NONCHALANCE WAS VERY HARD TO SUSTAIN AND I OFTEN FELT MYSELF A MOST CONFOUNDED HYPOCRITE WITH IT ALL
HOW LONELY SHE MUST FEEL AND PRAY BE QUICK ABOUT IT
THE CARRIAGE DROVE ON AND ENTERED THE GATES BEFORE US
OF THE ARDENT AFFECTION SO MISERABLY WASTED THE FOND FAITH SO CRUELLY BETRAYED THE--NO I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO ENUMERATE HIS WRONGS--BUT I HATED HIS WIFE AND MY HUSBAND MORE INTENSELY THAN EVER AND NOT FOR MY SAKE BUT FOR HIS
DID I NOT KNOW MRS GRAHAM
A DENIAL IT WAS DECIDED THOUGH NOT UNKIND
AND WHENEVER SHE DOES MAKE A SACRIFICE OR PERFORM A REMARKABLE ACT OF DEVOTEDNESS SHE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE TO LET ME KNOW THE EXTENT OF IT
FOR I HAD ROMANTIC NOTIONS ONCE AND--I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT I REGRET MY LOT FOR I AM QUITE SURE I DON'T BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU SAID I
I DON'T WANT TO BE IDOLISED I ANSWERED
IF YOUR MOTHER AND BROTHER ARE UNKIND TO YOU YOU MAY LEAVE THEM BUT REMEMBER YOU ARE BOUND TO YOUR HUSBAND FOR LIFE BUT I CANNOT LEAVE THEM UNLESS I GET MARRIED AND I CANNOT GET MARRIED IF NOBODY SEES ME
ONLY WHEN I'M IN A BAD HUMOUR OR A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE AND WANT TO AFFLICT FOR THE PLEASURE OF COMFORTING
THE CARPET CAUGHT HIS FOOT AND THERE'S NO GREAT HARM DONE
THAT OLD HAG WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME I MEAN TO STAY WITH YOU SAID I
AND HE SOON RELINQUISHED THE PURSUIT AS HOPELESS OR WAS CALLED AWAY BY HIS MOTHER
AT PRESENT I MUST CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY ASSERTING THAT I KNEW THEM TO BE FALSE AND WOULD PROVE IT SOME DAY TO THE SHAME OF THOSE WHO SLANDERED HER
AT FIRST HE ADDRESSED ME AS THE NURSE BUT ON MY CROSSING THE ROOM TO DRAW UP THE WINDOW-BLINDS IN OBEDIENCE TO HIS DIRECTIONS HE SAID NO IT ISN'T NURSE
ARE YOU TOO BUSY MAKING LOVE TO MY NIECE TO MAKE WAR WITH THE PHEASANTS?--FIRST OF OCTOBER REMEMBER
WHY COULDN'T YOU COME TO MAKE TEA FOR US
BY WHAT I HAVE DONE FOR YOU YOU MAY JUDGE OF WHAT I WILL DO--IF IT BE NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE HIGHER DUTY I OWE TO MY SON HIGHER BECAUSE HE NEVER FORFEITED HIS CLAIMS AND BECAUSE I HOPE TO DO MORE GOOD TO HIM THAN I CAN EVER DO TO YOU
IF IT WERE MYSELF ALONE I WOULD NOT COMPLAIN BUT I AM FORBIDDEN TO RESCUE MY SON FROM RUIN AND WHAT WAS ONCE MY ONLY CONSOLATION IS BECOME THE CROWNING SOURCE OF MY DESPAIR
I AM NOT GOING TO SELL MY CHILD FOR GOLD THOUGH IT WERE TO SAVE BOTH HIM AND ME FROM STARVING
IT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S ALL RIGHT
NOT IN GENERAL HE REPLIED BUT THAT IS SUCH A SWEET CHILD AND SO LIKE ITS MOTHER HE ADDED IN A LOWER TONE
THE GENTLEMEN ARE ALL GONE OUT TO SHOOT AND THE LADIES ARE WITH MY AUNT AT WORK IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
IT SUITS ME BETTER AS IT IS SHE ADDED IN A TONE OF MOURNFUL RESIGNATION
THAT SHE WILL NOT REFUSE HIM FOR HIS POVERTY AND DOES NOT COURT HIM FOR HIS RANK BUT LOVES HIM FOR HIMSELF ALONE BUT IS NOT HE COURTING HER FOR HER FORTUNE NO NOT HE
I SOMETIMES THINK HE RESEMBLES YOU MORE THAN HIS FATHER
MAMMA LOOKED GRAVE AND MRS MAXWELL SHOOK HER HEAD
THAT IS NOTHING TO ME SIR I RETORTED
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF HER FOR THE PRESENT
AS BESIDES BEING MORE THAN COMMONLY THICK IT WAS PROTECTED BY A REDUNDANT SHOCK OF SHORT REDDISH CURLS THAT MY MOTHER CALLED AUBURN
A FEW SIDELONG GLANCES AND A WHISPERED OBSERVATION THAT THE GHOST WAS COME WAS ALL THE NOTICE HE DREW BY HIS APPEARANCE AND WE WENT ON WITH OUR MERRY CAROUSALS AS BEFORE TILL HE STARTLED US ALL BY SUDDENLY DRAWING IN HIS CHAIR AND LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND EXCLAIMING WITH PORTENTOUS SOLEMNITY,--"WELL
NO I AM THE ORDINARY MORTAL I MAINTAIN REPLIED MR HARGRAVE
AND YET THROUGH ALL I WAS NOT WHOLLY COMFORTLESS
MR HATTERSLEY SOMETIMES OFFERS HIS SERVICES INSTEAD OF MINE BUT ARTHUR WILL NOT LET ME GO
PRESENTLY HOWEVER THE DOOR WAS GENTLY OPENED AND SOMEONE ENTERED THE ROOM
WE HAD MET SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THE
IT'S TOO FAR OBJECTED HIS MOTHER
HER APPEARANCE MANNERS AND DRESS AND THE VERY FURNITURE OF THE ROOM SHE INHABITED WERE ALL SET BEFORE ME WITH RATHER MORE CLEARNESS AND PRECISION THAN I CARED TO SEE THEM
YOU'RE MIGHTY SUDDEN IN YOUR RESOLUTION
I DID NOT LIKE TO GO QUITE TO THE FRONT AND STARE IN AT THE GATE
FOR INSTANCE I SHOULD KNOW BY YOUR COUNTENANCE THAT YOU WERE NOT OF A CHEERFUL SANGUINE DISPOSITION
WERE YOU SPEAKING ARTHUR I ASKED
WHY CANNOT YOU I REPEATED WITH A DEGREE OF IRASCIBILITY THAT ROUSED HER TO LIFT HER EYES AND LOOK ME STEADILY IN THE FACE
WHAT FOOLS THEY ARE DRAWLED MR GRIMSBY WHO HAD BEEN TALKING AWAY AT MY ELBOW WITH SENTENTIOUS GRAVITY ALL THE TIME
I WENT HOME VERY HAPPY WITH A HEART BRIMFUL OF COMPLACENCY FOR MYSELF AND OVERFLOWING WITH LOVE FOR ELIZA
HAVE I NOT LABOURED LONG AND HARD TO SAVE HIM FROM THIS VERY VICE
NOTHING COULD FILL THE VOID MY FAITH AND HOPE AND JOY IN HELEN GRAHAM HAD LEFT OR DRIVE AWAY THE KEEN REGRETS AND BITTER DREGS OF LINGERING LOVE THAT STILL OPPRESSED IT
IF MY ONGOINGS DON'T SUIT HER SHE SHOULD TELL ME SO IS SHE NOT EXACTLY THE WIFE YOU WANTED
YES FULL WELL MY LITTLE MAN ALTERED THOUGH YOU ARE REPLIED I SURVEYING THE COMPARATIVELY TALL SLIM YOUNG GENTLEMAN WITH HIS MOTHER'S IMAGE VISIBLY STAMPED UPON HIS FAIR INTELLIGENT FEATURES IN SPITE OF THE BLUE EYES BEAMING WITH GLADNESS AND THE BRIGHT LOCKS CLUSTERING BENEATH HIS CAP
I WENT ON TRUSTING AND BELIEVING HOPING AGAINST HOPE AND ADORING WHERE I COULD NOT COMPREHEND
AND THEN I'VE LOST MY CAROLINE AND HE BEGAN TO SNIVEL THEN FOR THE BRANDY HAD SOFTENED HIS HEART
BUT MY EXCELLENT PARENT WENT ON LECTURING AND THEN CAME TO COAXING AND BEGAN TO STROKE MY HAIR
BUT THE GLEAM OF A BRIGHT RED FIRE THROUGH THE PARLOUR WINDOW HAD MORE EFFECT IN CHEERING MY SPIRITS AND REBUKING MY THANKLESS REPININGS THAN ALL THE SAGE REFLECTIONS AND GOOD RESOLUTIONS I HAD FORCED MY MIND TO FRAME;--FOR I WAS YOUNG THEN REMEMBER--ONLY FOUR-AND-TWENTY--AND HAD NOT ACQUIRED HALF THE RULE OVER MY OWN SPIRIT THAT I NOW POSSESS--TRIFLING AS THAT MAY BE
SHE GAVE ME HER HAND WITHOUT TURNING HER HEAD AND MURMURED IN A VOICE SHE STROVE IN VAIN TO STEADY,--'CAN YOU FORGIVE ME IT MIGHT BE DEEMED A BREACH OF TRUST I THOUGHT TO CONVEY THAT LILY HAND TO MY LIPS SO I ONLY GENTLY PRESSED IT BETWEEN MY OWN AND SMILINGLY REPLIED,--'I HARDLY CAN
HE CAUGHT HER UP AND THERE FOLLOWED SOME MINUTES OF VERY ROUGH PLAY DURING WHICH IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER THE FATHER OR THE DAUGHTER LAUGHED AND SHOUTED THE LOUDEST
IF I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE SO NERVOUS I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAUTIOUS
MY NAME IS ARTHUR I'LL CALL YOU NOTHING--FOR I'LL HAVE NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH YOU IF YOU TALK IN THAT WAY ANY MORE
AND MY OPINION IS THAT IF THERE BE A COMPARISON MADE BETWEEN THE TWO THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE MOST PART IS CERTAINLY IN HATTERSLEY'S FAVOUR MILICENT'S OWN HEART TOLD HER HOW MUCH IT COST ME TO MAKE THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT
I'VE GIVEN HIM UP FOR MY PART--FAIRLY DISOWNED HIM--CAST HIM OFF ROOT AND BRANCH
AND DO I REGRET THE STEP I HAVE TAKEN
WHEN I SPEND MY MONEY I LIKE TO ENJOY THE FULL VALUE OF IT
BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE SHE WILL EVER BE LED TO ACCEPT SUCH A SUITOR--ONE SO REPUGNANT TO ALL HER IDEAS OF A MAN TO BE HONOURED AND LOVED
HE OCCASIONALLY SOUGHT MY COMPANY BUT AS FREQUENTLY SHRUNK FROM IT FEARING LEST I SHOULD WILE HIM BACK TO DESTRUCTION AND I FOUND HIS NOT VERY ENTERTAINING ESPECIALLY AS HE SOMETIMES ATTEMPTED TO AWAKEN MY CONSCIENCE AND DRAW ME FROM THE PERDITION HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF TO HAVE ESCAPED
HE WAS MY OWN HELEN'S SON AND THEREFORE MINE
THE ONE EXCEPTION BEING MR BOARHAM WHO IN CONSIDERATION OF THE RAIN THAT HAD FALLEN DURING THE NIGHT THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO REMAIN BEHIND A LITTLE AND JOIN THEM IN A WHILE WHEN THE SUN HAD DRIED THE GRASS
TO BE SURE I DO RESPONDED HE
WHEN THE COMPANY WERE RETIRING TO THEIR CHAMBERS I GENTLY OPENED THE DOOR AND JUST AS HE PASSED BECKONED HIM IN
HER VOICE WAS GENTLE AND CHILDISH HER TREAD LIGHT AND SOFT AS THAT OF A CAT:--BUT HER MANNERS MORE FREQUENTLY RESEMBLED THOSE OF A PRETTY PLAYFUL KITTEN THAT IS NOW PERT AND ROGUISH NOW TIMID AND DEMURE ACCORDING TO ITS OWN SWEET WILL
IN THIS TIME OF WEAKNESS AND DEPRESSION HE WOULD HAVE MADE IT HIS MEDICINE AND SUPPORT HIS COMFORTER HIS RECREATION AND HIS FRIEND AND THEREBY SUNK DEEPER AND DEEPER AND BOUND HIMSELF DOWN FOR EVER IN THE BATHOS WHEREINTO HE HAD FALLEN
MR HARGRAVE ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM A LITTLE BEFORE THE OTHERS AND CHALLENGED ME TO A GAME OF CHESS
HUM
AND I KNOW THIS THAT IF HE HAS COMMITTED ERRORS THEY ARE ONLY SUCH AS ARE COMMON TO YOUTH AND SUCH AS NOBODY THINKS ANYTHING ABOUT
I WOULD TAKE THE MORNING COACH FROM L THE EVENING ONE WOULD BE ALREADY GONE AND FLY TO GRASSDALE--I MUST BE THERE BEFORE THE MARRIAGE
NO LADY LOWBOROUGH I DO NOT FOUND MY CHARGE UPON SUSPICION ON WHAT DO YOU FOUND IT THEN SAID SHE THROWING HERSELF INTO AN ARM-CHAIR AND STRETCHING OUT HER FEET TO THE FENDER WITH AN OBVIOUS EFFORT TO APPEAR COMPOSED
MRS HUNTINGDON MOVED AWAY AND STOOD IN THE RECESS OF THE WINDOW
ANNE ABOUT TWENTY-ONE OR TWENTY-TWO
I SHALL BE AT HOME IN A FEW MINUTES OH BUT DO STAY AND TAKE A LITTLE
AND THAT WITH GOD'S HELP AND MY EXERTIONS IT WOULD BE THE MEANS OF ELEVATING HIS MIND AND REFINING HIS TASTE TO A DUE APPRECIATION OF THE SALUTARY AND PURE DELIGHTS OF NATURE AND PEACE AND HOLY LOVE
YOU ARE FLYING IN THE FACE OF HEAVEN'S DECREES
I MUST HAVE A BAD DISPOSITION FOR MY MISFORTUNES HAVE SOURED AND EMBITTERED ME EXCEEDINGLY
AND HENCEFORTH I WOULD PUT MY SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL AND TOIL AWAY LIKE ANY POOR DRUDGE OF A CART-HORSE THAT WAS FAIRLY BROKEN IN TO ITS LABOUR AND PLOD THROUGH LIFE NOT WHOLLY USELESS IF NOT AGREEABLE AND UNCOMPLAINING IF NOT CONTENTED WITH MY LOT
TWO SUCH PLAYERS--IT WILL BE QUITE A TREAT
AND EACH TIME HE HAS PROMISED THEY SHOULD NEVER AGAIN BE REPEATED
THE FOREHEAD WAS LOFTY AND INTELLECTUAL THE NOSE A PERFECT AQUILINE AND THE FEATURES IN GENERAL UNEXCEPTIONABLE--ONLY THERE WAS A SLIGHT HOLLOWNESS ABOUT THE CHEEKS AND EYES AND THE LIPS THOUGH FINELY FORMED WERE A LITTLE TOO THIN A LITTLE TOO FIRMLY COMPRESSED AND HAD SOMETHING ABOUT THEM THAT BETOKENED I THOUGHT NO VERY SOFT OR AMIABLE TEMPER
EXCUSE ME MRS HUNTINGDON SAID HE BUT I WAS SPELL-BOUND

WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE
I DID COME AGAIN IN SPRING AND AGREEABLY TO HELEN'S INJUNCTIONS DID MY BEST TO CULTIVATE HER ACQUAINTANCE
ARE THE MARRIAGE VOWS A JEST
I WAS NOT REALLY ANGRY
ALL TRACES OF GLOOM AND PROUD OR COLD RESERVE HAD VANISHED FOR THE TIME
I HAVE SEARCHED IT THROUGH AND FOUND NEARLY THIRTY PASSAGES ALL TENDING TO SUPPORT THE SAME THEORY AND IS THAT THE USE YOU MAKE OF YOUR BIBLE
AND I WOULD SOONER DIE THAN ASK HIM LEST HE SHOULD MISCONSTRUE INTO COVETOUSNESS MY DESIRE TO KNOW
I AM COME TO TAKE CARE OF YOU AND DO WHAT NONE OF THEM WOULD DO FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T TORMENT ME NOW CRIED HE IN PITIABLE AGITATION
DO YOU REMEMBER HELEN OUR CONVERSATION THE NIGHT BUT ONE BEFORE WE LEFT STANINGLEY YES AUNT AND DO YOU REMEMBER HOW I WARNED YOU AGAINST LETTING YOUR HEART BE STOLEN FROM YOU BY THOSE UNWORTHY OF ITS POSSESSION AND FIXING YOUR AFFECTIONS WHERE APPROBATION DID NOT GO BEFORE AND WHERE REASON AND JUDGMENT WITHHELD THEIR SANCTION YES
AND THIS AND ALL SIR SAID THE ASTONISHED SERVANT REFERRING TO THE HALF-FINISHED PICTURE
IN LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK AFTER THIS I MET HIM RETURNING FROM A VISIT TO THE WILSONS
NOW RESUMED HE AFTER A MOMENTARY PAUSE LET US TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
BUT TO NO PURPOSE
I SHALL NOT BE ABSENT ABOVE A WEEK OR FORTNIGHT AT MOST BUT IF I MUST GO I WILL GO ALONE
AND IF THAT WON'T ANSWER TO BEAR WITH HIM TO EXCUSE HIM AND FORGIVE HIM AS WELL AS I CAN AND RESTRAIN MY OWN EVIL PASSIONS FROM AGGRAVATING HIS
WE MANAGED VERY WELL WITHOUT THEM HOWEVER
I DON'T KNOW CONFOUND IT I MUTTERED
WE SHALL SEE WHO WILL TIRE FIRST MY LADY IF I TIRE IT WILL BE OF LIVING IN THE WORLD WITH YOU
LET ME HOLD YOU SO
AND AS FOR MR OLDFIELD SHE HAS GIVEN HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE REFUSED HIS OFFER NOT FROM ANY DISLIKE OF HIS PERSON BUT MERELY BECAUSE I AM GIDDY AND YOUNG AND CANNOT AT PRESENT RECONCILE MYSELF TO THE THOUGHTS OF MARRIAGE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
BUT I ALWAYS BEGAN TO TALK OF OTHER THINGS AND WAITED FIRST TO SEE IF HE WOULD INTRODUCE THE SUBJECT
YOU'VE SEEN HER CRIED I IN ASTONISHMENT
IT WAS OF HIS DAUGHTER ELIZA
BRING ANOTHER YOU EXPOSE YOURSELF FINELY OBSERVED I AS THE MAN DEPARTED
HE WOULD BE I RETURNED IF THAT BRILLIANCE OF EYE AND LIP AND CHEEK WERE NATURAL TO HIM
IS IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME RASH VOW IT IS SOMETHING OF THE KIND SHE ANSWERED
AND YOU HAVE A MOTHER AND SISTERS AND FRIENDS WHO WOULD BE SERIOUSLY INJURED BY YOUR DISGRACE
FOR THOUGH I MIGHT DISCLAIM ALL IDEA OF EVER ASPIRING TO HER HAND OR EVEN OF SOLICITING A PLACE IN HER FRIENDLY REGARD HER PEACE SHOULD NOT BE BROKEN BY MY PRESENCE NOR HER HEART AFFLICTED BY THE SIGHT OF MY FIDELITY
AND I'M DETERMINED YOU SHALL BE AS GOOD FRIENDS AS EVER BEFORE YOU GO ESTHER HOW CAN YOU BE SO RUDE CRIED MRS HARGRAVE WHO WAS SEATED GRAVELY KNITTING IN HER EASY-CHAIR
COULD IT BE TO DASH AWAY A TEAR
URGED BY A SUDDEN IMPERATIVE IMPULSE TO DELIVER MY SON FROM THAT CONTAMINATING INFLUENCE I CAUGHT HIM UP IN MY ARMS AND CARRIED HIM WITH ME OUT OF THE ROOM
AND THEREFORE I WISHED WITH ALL MY HEART THAT IT MIGHT PLEASE HEAVEN TO REMOVE HIM TO A BETTER WORLD OR IF THAT MIGHT NOT BE STILL TO TAKE HIM OUT OF THIS
COME MAN AND HELP ME
WHAT POSSIBLE PRETEXT COULD I FRAME FOR SUCH A THING
AND THOUGHTLESS GIRLS MAY BE GLAD TO WIN THE SMILES OF SO HANDSOME A GENTLEMAN WITHOUT SEEKING TO PENETRATE BEYOND THE SURFACE
AS FOR THEIR TALK I PAID BUT LITTLE ATTENTION TO THAT WHEN IT RELATED TO THE FAIR HERMIT I MEAN AND THE ONLY INFORMATION I DERIVED FROM IT WAS THAT ONE FINE FROSTY DAY SHE HAD VENTURED TO TAKE HER LITTLE BOY AS FAR AS THE VICARAGE AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY NOBODY WAS AT HOME BUT MISS MILLWARD
SHE SAID SHE WAS
YOU WOULD HAVE US ENCOURAGE OUR SONS TO PROVE ALL THINGS BY THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE WHILE OUR DAUGHTERS MUST NOT EVEN PROFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS
PREPOSTEROUS SHRIEKED FERGUS
BUT WHILE I SECRETLY EXULTED IN MY POWER I FELT DISPOSED TO DALLY WITH MY VICTIM LIKE A CAT
ALL TIME SEEMED LOST THAT WAS NOT DEVOTED TO STUDY OR EXACTED BY HIS PHYSICAL NATURE FOR THE BARE SUPPORT OF LIFE
BUT ELIZA TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE FIRST CONVENIENT PAUSE TO ASK IF I HAD LATELY SEEN MRS GRAHAM IN A TONE OF MERELY CASUAL INQUIRY BUT WITH A SIDELONG GLANCE--INTENDED TO BE PLAYFULLY MISCHIEVOUS--REALLY BRIMFUL AND RUNNING OVER WITH MALICE
HOW WHITE YOU LOOK
DETERMINED AT ONCE TO PROVE THE TRUTH--OR RATHER THE FALSEHOOD--OF HER STORY I HASTENED TO WOODFORD AS FAST AS MY LEGS COULD CARRY ME
WAS IT ALL BLACKNESS AND DESOLATION
AS FOR RICHARD WILSON'S SISTER SHE HAVING BEEN WHOLLY UNABLE TO RECAPTURE MR LAWRENCE OR OBTAIN ANY PARTNER RICH AND ELEGANT ENOUGH TO SUIT HER IDEAS OF WHAT THE HUSBAND OF JANE WILSON OUGHT TO BE IS YET IN SINGLE BLESSEDNESS
HE KEPT HIS OATH ABOUT GAMBLING NOT A LITTLE TO THE SURPRISE OF US ALL THOUGH GRIMSBY DID HIS UTMOST TO TEMPT HIM TO BREAK IT BUT NOW HE HAD GOT HOLD OF ANOTHER HABIT THAT BOTHERED HIM NEARLY AS MUCH FOR HE SOON DISCOVERED THAT THE DEMON OF DRINK WAS AS BLACK AS THE DEMON OF PLAY AND NEARLY AS HARD TO GET RID OF--ESPECIALLY AS HIS KIND FRIENDS DID ALL THEY COULD TO SECOND THE PROMPTINGS OF HIS OWN INSATIABLE CRAVINGS THEN THEY WERE DEMONS THEMSELVES CRIED I UNABLE TO CONTAIN MY INDIGNATION
THE TIME PASSED QUICKLY BUT VERY VERY HAPPILY AND IT HAS DONE ME GOOD
AND I LONG TO SEE IT I WAS ABOUT TO COMPLY WITH HER REQUEST BUT ROSE WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO PROCEED
AND IF I WERE DIVORCED FROM MY HUSBAND OR IF HE WERE DEAD I WOULD NOT MARRY YOU
A LIGHT QUICK STEP CAME OUT OF THE ANTE-ROOM CROSSED THE HALL AND ASCENDED THE STAIRS
AND IF ABSTINENCE BE AN EVIL WHICH SOME HAVE DOUBTED NO ONE WILL DENY THAT EXCESS IS A GREATER
PERHAPS YOU WILL NOT MIND IT AS YOU'RE SO VERY PHILOSOPHICAL ON CERTAIN POINTS HE ADDED WITH A SLIGHT SNEER
AND CERTAINLY I SAW NOTHING THENCEFORTH PARTICULARLY REPREHENSIBLE OR SUSPICIOUS IN HER DEMEANOUR TOWARDS HER HOST
DETERMINED TO KNOW THE WORST I HASTILY POCKETED MY TWO LETTERS AND MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT BEING TOO LATE FOR THE POST LEFT THE ROOM RUSHED INTO THE YARD AND VOCIFEROUSLY CALLED FOR MY HORSE
I'VE ENOUGH TO DO AGAINST THE FIEND WITHIN ME THEN YOU'RE A WHITE-LIVERED FOOL AND I WASH MY HANDS OF YOU GRUMBLED THE TEMPTER AS HE SWUNG HIMSELF ROUND AND DEPARTED
MR HARGRAVE TURNED SERIOUSLY TO ME AND EARNESTLY BEGAN DEAR MRS HUNTINGDON HOW I HAVE LONGED FOR YET DREADED THIS HOUR
AND WHO CAN TELL BUT HEAVEN AT LAST MAY ANSWER ALL MY THOUSAND PRAYERS AND BID THE FUTURE PAY THE PAST WITH JOY FOR ANGUISH SMILES FOR TEARS
I ALMOST WISH I WERE NOT A PAINTER OBSERVED MY COMPANION
AND WHAT WILL ARTHUR BE WITH ALL HIS NATURAL SWEETNESS OF DISPOSITION IF I DO NOT SAVE HIM FROM THAT WORLD AND THOSE COMPANIONS
BUT WHAT IF HE SHOULD DENOUNCE ME TO HIS SISTER IN THE MEANTIME
I FIND MYSELF IN RATHER A SINGULAR POSITION
BUT I WOULD HAVE YOUR THOUGHTS CHANGED
HER NAME IS NEVER HEARD AND GLANCING UP I CAUGHT HIM WITH HIS EYE ASKANCE ON ME AND HIS FINGER POINTED TO HIS FOREHEAD
NOT EVEN HIS SERVANTS OR HIS BEST FRIENDS MUST KNOW OF HIS VISITS TO WILDFELL--EXCEPT ON SUCH OCCASIONS AS A LANDLORD MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO CALL UPON A STRANGER TENANT--LEST SUSPICION SHOULD BE EXCITED AGAINST ME WHETHER OF THE TRUTH OR OF SOME SLANDEROUS FALSEHOOD
AND I BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO DELIVER IT WITHOUT ANY MATERIAL OBJECTIONS IF I HAD HAD THE SENSE TO ASK HIM THOUGH OF COURSE HE WOULD NOT OFFER TO DO SO IF I WAS CONTENT TO LET IT ALONE
BUT HALF THE CREDIT--OR THE BLAME OF IT WHICH YOU PLEASE MUST BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE WHIP WHICH WAS GARNISHED WITH A MASSIVE HORSE'S HEAD OF PLATED METAL
PREVIOUS HOWEVER TO DIRECTING MY MIND TO THE SERVICE I GLANCED ROUND THE CHURCH TO SEE IF ANY ONE HAD BEEN OBSERVING ME;--BUT NO,--ALL WHO WERE NOT ATTENDING TO THEIR PRAYER-BOOKS WERE ATTENDING TO THE STRANGE LADY,--MY GOOD MOTHER AND SISTER AMONG THE REST AND MRS WILSON AND HER DAUGHTER
THAT FATHER ON THE CONTRARY HAS NO WEIGHT OF SADNESS ON HIS MIND
SO WE MUST ASK THEM BOTH
IT BEGINS SOMEWHAT ABRUPTLY THUS--BUT WE WILL RESERVE ITS COMMENCEMENT FOR ANOTHER CHAPTER
WHEREAS MY BRAINS BEING COMPOSED OF MORE SOLID MATERIALS WILL ABSORB A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF THIS ALCOHOLIC VAPOUR WITHOUT THE PRODUCTION OF ANY SENSIBLE RESULT I THINK YOU WILL FIND A SENSIBLE RESULT PRODUCED ON THAT TEA INTERRUPTED MR HARGRAVE BY THE QUANTITY OF SUGAR YOU HAVE PUT INTO IT
NOW HALFORD BEFORE I CLOSE THIS LETTER I'LL TELL YOU WHO ELIZA MILLWARD WAS
AND THAT WAS WHAT SHE TOLD ME THE FOOTMAN TOLD HER:--THAT MRS HUNTINGDON WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED ON THURSDAY AND MR LAWRENCE WAS GONE TO THE WEDDING
VERY WELL
HE THEN TOOK THE LIBERTY OF WALKING UP TO THE FIRE HIMSELF AND ASKING ME IF I WERE AWARE THAT MR HUNTINGDON WAS NOW AT THE SEAT OF LORD LOWBOROUGH AND LIKELY TO CONTINUE THERE SOME TIME
I MUST THEREFORE BEG THAT HEREAFTER ALL FAMILIAR INTERCOURSE MAY CEASE BETWEEN US
BUT JUSTICE AND HONESTY APART I COULD NOT BEAR TO DO IT
BUT STILL I WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT SORT OF AN EXPLANATION SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME--OR WOULD GIVE NOW IF I PRESSED HER FOR IT--HOW MUCH SHE WOULD CONFESS AND HOW SHE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO EXCUSE HERSELF
I VALUE MY COMFORT FAR TOO MUCH
AND FINALLY I EXTINGUISHED BOTH THE CANDLES BUT HE ONLY WHEELED ROUND TO THE FIRE AND RAISING A BLAZE SUFFICIENT FOR HIS PURPOSES CALMLY CONTINUED THE INVESTIGATION
NO LOVE,--UNLESS YOU WILL GO WITH ME I WILL GLADLY I ANSWERED IF YOU THINK THE CHANGE WILL AMUSE YOU AND IF YOU WILL PUT OFF THE JOURNEY TILL NEXT WEEK HE READILY CONSENTED BUT SAID THERE WAS NO NEED OF MUCH PREPARATION AS HE SHOULD NOT BE FOR STAYING LONG FOR HE DID NOT WISH ME TO BE LONDONIZED AND TO LOSE MY COUNTRY FRESHNESS AND ORIGINALITY BY TOO MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH THE LADIES OF THE WORLD
WHEN SHE WAS GONE THE REST WAS ALL A BLANK OR WORSE
I MUST BE GOING MAD CRIED HE OR SOMETHING--DELIRIOUS PERHAPS
WE SELDOM TALKED ABOUT MRS HUNTINGDON
AS FOR MR HATTERSLEY HE HAD NEVER WHOLLY FORGOTTEN HIS RESOLUTION TO COME OUT FROM AMONG THEM AND BEHAVE LIKE A MAN AND A CHRISTIAN AND THE LAST ILLNESS AND DEATH OF HIS ONCE JOLLY FRIEND HUNTINGDON SO DEEPLY AND SERIOUSLY IMPRESSED HIM WITH THE EVIL OF THEIR FORMER PRACTICES THAT HE NEVER NEEDED ANOTHER LESSON OF THE KIND
AT LAST HE CAME SLOWLY AND STUMBLINGLY ASCENDING THE STAIRS SUPPORTED BY GRIMSBY AND HATTERSLEY WHO NEITHER OF THEM WALKED QUITE STEADILY THEMSELVES BUT WERE BOTH LAUGHING AND JOKING AT HIM AND MAKING NOISE ENOUGH FOR ALL THE SERVANTS TO HEAR
ELIZA WAS MY NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
UPON MY NAMING MISS WILSON AMONG THE REST HE SEEMED HALF INCLINED TO GO BUT WHEN I MENTIONED MRS GRAHAM THINKING IT MIGHT BE A FURTHER INDUCEMENT IT APPEARED TO HAVE A CONTRARY EFFECT AND HE DECLINED IT ALTOGETHER AND TO CONFESS THE TRUTH THE DECISION WAS NOT DISPLEASING TO ME THOUGH I COULD SCARCELY TELL YOU WHY
THOUGH I FREQUENTLY BREAK OFF TO ATTEND TO HIM AND THOUGH MR HATTERSLEY IS ALSO BY HIS SIDE
AND ABOVE ALL BECAUSE SHE IS DETERMINED HER CHERISHED SON SHALL BE ENABLED TO HOLD UP HIS HEAD WITH THE HIGHEST GENTLEMEN IN THE LAND THIS SAME SON I IMAGINE IS A MAN OF EXPENSIVE HABITS NO RECKLESS SPENDTHRIFT AND NO ABANDONED SENSUALIST BUT ONE WHO LIKES TO HAVE EVERYTHING HANDSOME ABOUT HIM AND TO GO TO A CERTAIN LENGTH IN YOUTHFUL INDULGENCES NOT SO MUCH TO GRATIFY HIS OWN TASTES AS TO MAINTAIN HIS REPUTATION AS A MAN OF FASHION IN THE WORLD AND A RESPECTABLE FELLOW AMONG HIS OWN LAWLESS COMPANIONS
YOU KNOW I MUST KEEP STRAIGHT WITH HER AS LONG AS I CAN
BUT IT IS NOT MY LOSS NOR HER TRIUMPH THAT I DEPLORE SO GREATLY AS THE WRECK OF MY FOND HOPES FOR HIS ADVANTAGE AND HER UNWORTHINESS OF HIS AFFECTION AND THE INJURY HE WILL DO HIMSELF BY TRUSTING HIS HAPPINESS TO HER
HE DETESTS THE VERY SIGHT OF WINE SHE ADDED AND THE SMELL OF IT ALMOST MAKES HIM SICK
AND WE REALLY BEGAN TO THINK HE WAS GOING TO KEEP HIS WORD
THE EVENING WAS KIND AND GENIAL AND SO WAS MY COMPANION
I AVOIDED ALL FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH HIM TILL WE CAME TO THE END OF OUR RIDE WHEN I MEANT TO JUMP OFF MY HORSE AND VANISH INTO THE HOUSE BEFORE HE COULD OFFER HIS ASSISTANCE
BUT LISTEN HERE
I'VE BEEN TO CALL ON MRS GRAHAM HAVE YOU INDEED HE NODDED GRAVELY AND ADDED WITH AWFUL EMPHASIS--'I THOUGHT IT INCUMBENT UPON ME TO DO SO REALLY EJACULATED MY MOTHER
AND QUICKLY RESTORING IT TO THE DARK CORNER WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL PLACED THE OTHER AGAINST IT AS BEFORE AND THEN TURNED TO ME AND LAUGHED
AND HIS HAT WAS ROLLING IN THE MUD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD
AND WHOEVER VENTURES TO SPEAK SLIGHTINGLY OF THE MAN I HAVE PROMISED TO LOVE TO HONOUR AND OBEY MUST EXPECT MY SERIOUS DISPLEASURE
I SEATED MYSELF IN THE NEAREST CHAIR
AND IF HE HAS ANY PARTICULAR CONNECTION WITH THE LADY AT ALL WHICH NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO ASSERT AT LEAST HE HAS WHAT CANNOT BE SAID OF SOME OTHERS SUFFICIENT SENSE OF PROPRIETY TO WITHHOLD HIM FROM ACKNOWLEDGING ANYTHING MORE THAN A BOWING ACQUAINTANCE IN THE PRESENCE OF RESPECTABLE PERSONS
THE GOOD-NATURED ANIMAL PAUSED LOOKED UP AND WAGGED HIS TAIL BUT MADE NO FURTHER ADVANCES
I WANTED TO KNOW THE CAUSE OF IT BUT SHE SEEMED RELUCTANT TO TELL
AND YET I CANNOT WISH TO LEAVE IT
BUT IN PROPORTION AS HE FEELS HIS ACUTE SUFFERING ABATING AND SEES THE DANGER RECEDING THE MORE INTRACTABLE HE BECOMES
SHE SAID AS FOR THE MAN HIMSELF I THOROUGHLY DESPISE HIM
I COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA OF HIS AMUSING HIMSELF OVER MY SECRET THOUGHTS AND RECOLLECTIONS
THE DOOR WAS CLOSED AGAIN--BUT I WAS NOT ALONE
WHEN I DID SO HE HESITATED AND ASKED WHO WERE GOING
WHILE I PUT DOWN THE SPONGE AND BASIN AND RESUMED MY SEAT AT THE BED-SIDE
IT IS SO HE ADDED AN AFFIRMATORY NOD AND CONTINUED TO GAZE UPON ME WITH A KIND OF IRATE SOLEMNITY HOLDING HIS SUBSTANTIAL STICK BETWEEN HIS KNEES WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED UPON ITS HEAD
HOW ILL HE LOOKS
BY NO MEANS REPLIED THE ORACLE WITH A JOVE-LIKE NOD
BUT BEFORE I COULD ADD MY SHARE OF REPROOF MR HARGRAVE REAPPEARED AT THE WINDOW WITH A BEAUTIFUL MOSS-ROSE IN HIS HAND
AND NO CONCLUSIONS ON THAT PARTICULAR ARE COME TO YET
I WISH I COULD CONVINCE YOU OF IT NOW CRIED I STARTING UP FROM BESIDE HIM
I MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO SNATCH THE BOOK FROM HIS HANDS BUT HE HELD IT TOO FIRMLY FOR THAT
PERHAPS HE FEELS HURT AT MY RESERVE
JULY 29TH.--MRS HARGRAVE AND HER DAUGHTER ARE COME BACK FROM LONDON
TELL ME WHAT IT IS
HEAVEN IS MY WITNESS THAT I THINK HER MERE DUST AND ASHES IN COMPARISON WITH YOU AND SHALL CONTINUE TO THINK SO UNLESS YOU DRIVE ME FROM YOU BY TOO MUCH SEVERITY
23RD.--OUR GUESTS ARRIVED ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO
AND SHE'LL SAY SHE CAN BE WALKING BACK TO THE HOUSE
I ONLY WANT TO KNOW IF YOU INTEND TO TAKE MY ADVICE WHAT ADVICE TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF YOU DOUBLE-DYED SCOUNDREL SHOUTED RALPH AND BEG YOUR WIFE'S PARDON AND BE A GOOD BOY FOR THE FUTURE MY WIFE
WHERE IS ANNABELLA SAID HARGRAVE GRAVELY AFTER GLANCING ROUND THE ROOM
BUT SHE HAVING SOJOURNED FOR HALF A CENTURY IN THIS LAND OF SIN AND SORROW HAS LEARNED TO BE SUSPICIOUS HERSELF
THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME BEFORE YOU AND NEITHER YOUR UNCLE NOR I ARE IN ANY HURRY TO GET YOU OFF OUR HANDS AND I MAY VENTURE TO SAY THERE WILL BE NO LACK OF SUITORS
AND YOU COOLLY TELL ME IT IS THE WILL OF GOD THAT WE SHOULD REMAIN SO
I BEQUEATHED THE FARM TO FERGUS WITH BETTER HOPES OF ITS PROSPERITY THAN I SHOULD HAVE HAD A YEAR AGO UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
HELEN IS THAT YOU SAID HE
ON ONE CONDITION ONLY
BUT I WOULD TRY TO CONSOLE HIM THOUGH I KNEW NOT HOW TO ATTEMPT IT
AND IT WAS WELL I HAD NOT WAITED FOR IT
DON'T WAIT THEN WHEN MAY I SEE YOU AGAIN AT LUNCH SAID I DEPARTING WITH LITTLE HELEN IN ONE ARM AND LEADING ARTHUR BY THE HAND
THE WORST OF THEM GENERALLY KNOW HOW TO HIDE THEIR MISDEEDS FROM THEIR SISTERS EYES AND THEIR MOTHER'S TOO AND THERE IS LORD LOWBOROUGH CONTINUED I QUITE A DECENT MAN WHO TOLD YOU SO
HEARING HIS CRIES THE FATHER CAME TO THE ROOM
BUT I HAVE FOUGHT MY WAY THROUGH FLOOD AND FIRE TO WIN IT
EMILY WAS TORN FROM LIFE CONSCIOUS PANTING RELUCTANT TO USE CHARLOTTE'S OWN WORDS
NO FOR IF YOU WERE YOU WOULD BE GLAD TO RELIEVE ME AND SO I SHOULD IF I COULD DO SO WITHOUT INJURING MYSELF OR ANY OTHER AND CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT I SHOULD WISH YOU TO INJURE YOURSELF
YOU MUST BE QUIET NOW NO LET ME SEE HIM NOW I PROMISE IF IT MUST BE SO NO I SWEAR IT AS GOD IS IN HEAVEN
I POINTED TO THE CHILDREN FOR I COULD NOT TRUST MYSELF TO SPEAK
YES YOU--BUT ONLY BY YOUR EXCEEDING GOODNESS
AND THEN SAID GRIMSBY WHO HAD JUST COME IN YOU CAN TRY AGAIN YOU KNOW
SHE LOOKED DISPLEASED BUT SAID NO MORE ON THAT SUBJECT
YOUR AUNT WOULD PUT IT OFF TILL THE LORD KNOWS WHEN BUT HE IS ANXIOUS TO BE BOUND AS SOON AS MAY BE
HOW DIFFERENT WAS THIS FROM THE EVENING OF YESTERDAY
IN THIS MATTER I KNOW BETTER THAN YOU
IF I DID IT WAS NOT FOR PLEASURE AT THE THOUGHTS OF THE HARM I HAD DONE YOU
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE PASSED THE LAST MONTHS OF HER STAY AT THORPE GREEN UNDER A CLOUD OF DREAD AND MISERABLE SUSPICION AND WAS THANKFUL TO ESCAPE FROM HER SITUATION IN THE SUMMER OF 1845
HE KNOWS SUCH INDULGENCE INJURES HIS HEALTH AND DOES HIM MORE HARM THAN GOOD
YOU CAN PITY A DOLT OF A SERVANT FOR BREAKING A DISH
AND DON'T BRING THE CHEESE UNLESS YOU WANT TO MAKE ME SICK OUTRIGHT BENSON IN SOME SURPRISE REMOVED THE CHEESE AND DID HIS BEST TO EFFECT A QUIET AND SPEEDY CLEARANCE OF THE REST
IT NEVER ENTERS HIS CALCULATIONS EXCEPT MERELY AS AN ESSENTIAL WITHOUT WHICH FOR THE LADY'S OWN SAKE HE COULD NOT THINK OF MARRYING HER
NOR COULD YOU HAVE MADE ME DISCREDIT THE EVIDENCE OF MY SENSES
BUT YOU CAN SAY YES OR NO AS WELL AS I CAN'T TELL."--COME YES SHE WHISPERED HANGING HER HEAD AND BLUSHING AT THE AWFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT
AND NO DOUBT YOU HELPED HER NO
THEY DID NOT LIKE TO HAVE HIM SITTING THERE LIKE A SKELETON AT A FEAST INSTEAD OF CONTRIBUTING HIS QUOTA TO THE GENERAL AMUSEMENT CASTING A CLOUD OVER ALL AND WATCHING WITH GREEDY EYES EVERY DROP THEY CARRIED TO THEIR LIPS--THEY VOWED IT WAS NOT FAIR
BUT MAY WE NOT STILL MEET AS FRIENDS IT WILL NOT DO SHE REPLIED MOURNFULLY SHAKING HER HEAD
THERE WAS AN ASPECT OF SUBDUED EXHILARATION IN HER FACE THAT KINDLED INTO ALMOST A SMILE OF EXALTED GLAD INTELLIGENCE AS HER EYE MET MINE
DON'T TORMENT ME WITH YOUR PREACHMENTS NOW UNLESS YOU WANT TO KILL ME OUTRIGHT
THE ONLY ANSWER IT GAVE TO MY MESSAGE WAS THIS MR MARKHAM IS AT LIBERTY TO MAKE SUCH REVELATIONS CONCERNING ME AS HE JUDGES NECESSARY
MAY THEY BE SATISFIED WITH TRAMPLING THEM UNDER THEIR FEET AND NOT TURN AGAIN AND REND HER
28TH.--YESTERDAY WE ALL WENT TO THE GROVE MR HARGRAVE'S MUCH-NEGLECTED HOME
IT WAS A RELIEF TO BOTH WHEN THE LETTER-BAG WAS BROUGHT IN
AND D--N ME IF I DON'T MAKE HIM DRUNK BEFORE I LET HIM GO
SHE AND MARY JOURNEYED ALONG TOGETHER GENERALLY WITH THE CHILD BETWEEN THEM;--BUT WHERE THE ROAD PERMITTED I ALWAYS WALKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER RICHARD WILSON TAKING THE OTHER SIDE OF MISS MILLWARD AND FERGUS ROVING HERE AND THERE ACCORDING TO HIS FANCY
AND SOMETIMES I SUSPECTED IT THEN
SPRING IS APPROACHING
I'VE NOTHING TO TRY WITH SAID THE POOR DEVIL WITH A GHASTLY SMILE
BUT ON COMING WITHIN SIGHT OF THE GRIM OLD HALL SHE STOOD STILL AND TURNED TOWARDS ME WHILE SHE SPOKE AS IF EXPECTING I SHOULD GO NO FURTHER THAT THE CONVERSATION WOULD END HERE AND I SHOULD NOW TAKE LEAVE AND DEPART--AS INDEED IT WAS TIME TO DO FOR THE CLEAR COLD EVE WAS FAST DECLINING THE SUN HAD SET AND THE GIBBOUS MOON WAS VISIBLY BRIGHTENING IN THE PALE GREY SKY
THIS ONE ISN'T QUITE AS RICH NOR AS HANDSOME EITHER BUT SHE HASN'T BEEN MARRIED BEFORE
I'LL BET ANYTHING SHE'D RATHER HAVE THIS YOUNG FELLOW WITHOUT A PENNY THAN WILMOT WITH HIS HOUSE FULL OF GOLD
WHAT DID YOU LEAVE ME FOR IT IS I ARTHUR--IT IS HELEN YOUR WIFE I REPLIED
AND THOUGH I HAVE SPOKEN AGAINST HIM MYSELF IT IS FOR THE LAST TIME
CERTAINLY I TALKED ENOUGH FOR TWENTY AND SMILED UPON THEM ALL
IT SEEMS I AM STILL TO LOOK ON STANINGLEY AS MY HOME
AND AFTER AWHILE GRIMSBY DIRECTED MY ATTENTION TOWARDS IT BY A SIGNIFICANT WINK
BUT HOW ALTERED
WHEN I THINK HOW FONDLY HOW FOOLISHLY I HAVE LOVED HIM HOW MADLY I HAVE TRUSTED HIM HOW CONSTANTLY I HAVE LABOURED AND STUDIED AND PRAYED AND STRUGGLED FOR HIS ADVANTAGE
HATTERSLEY YOU KNOW HAS NOT YET FULFILLED HIS DIREFUL THREAT OF THROWING HIS PRECIOUS PERSON AWAY ON THE FIRST OLD MAID THAT CHOSE TO EVINCE A TENDERNESS FOR HIM
UNTIL A GUST OF WIND SWEPT OVER ME WHICH WHILE IT SCATTERED THE DEAD LEAVES LIKE BLIGHTED HOPES AROUND COOLED MY FOREHEAD AND SEEMED A LITTLE TO REVIVE MY SINKING FRAME
SOME WILL HAVE IT THAT YOU ARE A FOREIGNER AND SOME AN ENGLISHWOMAN
AND FIRST TURNING TO THE SHELVES HE SELECTED A VOLUME AND THEN QUIETLY BUT BY NO MEANS TIMIDLY APPROACHING ME HE STOOD BESIDE ME RESTING HIS HAND ON THE BACK OF MY CHAIR AND SAID SOFTLY AND SO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF FREE AT LAST YES SAID I WITHOUT MOVING OR RAISING MY EYES FROM MY BOOK FREE TO DO ANYTHING BUT OFFEND GOD AND MY CONSCIENCE THERE WAS A MOMENTARY PAUSE
AT THE MOMENT OF HER ARRIVAL HOWEVER THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE ROOM BUT FERGUS AND MYSELF MY MOTHER AND SISTER BEING BOTH OF THEM ABSENT ON HOUSEHOLD CARES INTENT
I WILL JUST TOUCH UPON TWO OTHER PERSONS WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED AND THEN BRING THIS LONG LETTER TO A CLOSE
AND AS THEY MIGHT SEE THE PICTURE AND MIGHT POSSIBLY RECOGNISE THE STYLE IN SPITE OF THE FALSE INITIALS I HAVE PUT IN THE CORNER I TAKE THE PRECAUTION TO GIVE A FALSE NAME TO THE PLACE ALSO IN ORDER TO PUT THEM ON A WRONG SCENT IF THEY SHOULD ATTEMPT TO TRACE ME OUT BY IT THEN YOU DON'T INTEND TO KEEP THE PICTURE SAID I ANXIOUS TO SAY ANYTHING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT
I WOULDN'T TOUCH HIM WITH THE TONGS I NOW RECOLLECTED THAT I HAD BUSINESS WITH ROBERT WILSON CONCERNING THE PURCHASE OF A CERTAIN FIELD ADJOINING MY FARM--A BUSINESS I HAD BEEN PUTTING OFF FROM DAY TO DAY
LET ME EXPLAIN--I'M COME TO OFFER YOU MY SERVICES FOR THOUGH HUNTINGDON IS MY FRIEND HE'S A DEVILISH SCAMP AS WE ALL KNOW AND I'LL BE YOUR FRIEND FOR THE NONCE
AND I WILL BE YOUR TASKMASTER INSTEAD OF BEING A HINDRANCE NO NO PERSISTED THE IMPRACTICABLE CREATURE
AND SHORTLY AFTER LUNCH TO WHICH THEY DID NOT THINK OF RETURNING I VOLUNTEERED TO ACCOMPANY THE LADIES IN A WALK AND SHOW ANNABELLA AND MILICENT THE BEAUTIES OF THE COUNTRY
SHE IS NOW AT THE GROVE CONTINUED THE LETTER BUT SHE OFTEN CALLS TO SEE ME
MY AUNT DESIRED HIM TO TAKE MISS HARGRAVE INTO THE DINING-ROOM AND ODIOUS MR WILMOT WITH UNSPEAKABLE GRIMACES OFFERED HIS ARM TO ME
AND AS IF I HAD BEEN SOME FRAIL BUTTERFLY HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF FEARFUL OF RUBBING THE SILVER OFF MY WINGS BY BRINGING ME INTO CONTACT WITH SOCIETY ESPECIALLY THAT OF PARIS AND ROME
DETERMINED TO INTERRUPT THE TETE-A-TETE I ROSE AND SELECTING A PIECE OF MUSIC FROM THE MUSIC STAND STEPPED UP TO THE PIANO INTENDING TO ASK THE LADY TO PLAY IT
I KNEW IT OR I WOULDN'T HAVE MENTIONED SUCH A THING BUT DON'T YOU TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT IT SAID I KISSING HER PALE TIME-WASTED CHEEK
WHERE ARE YOU GOING GILBERT SAID ROSE ONE EVENING SHORTLY AFTER TEA WHEN I HAD BEEN BUSY WITH THE FARM ALL DAY
THE THIRD WAS TO MY AUNT
I THOUGHT AN INTERVIEW WOULD ONLY DISTURB YOUR PEACE AND MADDEN ME
HAD THEY LIVED AT A DISTANCE HE MIGHT HAVE SURMOUNTED THE OBJECTION BUT WITHIN TWO OR THREE MILES OF WOODFORD IT WAS REALLY NO LIGHT MATTER
IF IT WERE MORE OBTRUSIVE IT WOULD TROUBLE ME LESS FOR THEN I COULD SNUB HIM
SUCH EXPERIENCE TO HIM TO USE A TRITE SIMILE WILL BE LIKE THE STORM TO THE OAK WHICH THOUGH IT MAY SCATTER THE LEAVES AND SNAP THE SMALLER BRANCHES SERVES BUT TO RIVET THE ROOTS AND TO HARDEN AND CONDENSE THE FIBRES OF THE TREE
AND I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP HIM TO THIS
AND HE HAD MANAGED SOMEHOW TO REMOVE HIMSELF FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD
SO THAT HE IS NOT WHOLLY DEPENDENT ON ME FOR ENTERTAINMENT
AND THEN SHE STOOD STILL AND CAST ONE LOOK BEHIND
TIME AND TALENTS SO SPENT I SHOULD CONSIDER WASTED AND MISAPPLIED
IT IS A NIGHT THAT WILL GIVE YOU YOUR DEATH IN ANOTHER MINUTE
AS THE STORY OF AGNES GREY WAS ACCUSED OF EXTRAVAGANT OVER-COLOURING IN THOSE VERY PARTS THAT WERE CAREFULLY COPIED FROM THE LIFE WITH A MOST SCRUPULOUS AVOIDANCE OF ALL EXAGGERATION SO IN THE PRESENT WORK I FIND MYSELF CENSURED FOR DEPICTING CON AMORE WITH A MORBID LOVE OF THE COARSE IF NOT OF THE BRUTAL THOSE SCENES WHICH I WILL VENTURE TO SAY HAVE NOT BEEN MORE PAINFUL FOR THE MOST FASTIDIOUS OF MY CRITICS TO READ THAN THEY WERE FOR ME TO DESCRIBE
THOUGH I WAS ANGERED BY ARTHUR'S CONDUCT AND THOUGH I FELT THAT HE HAD WRONGED ME AND WAS DETERMINED HE SHOULD FEEL IT TOO
AND I BELIEVE IT HAD NOT BEEN HIS INTENTION TO MENTION IT TO ME FOR WHEN I CAME TO SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND OBSERVED HE WAS NOT SO WELL AS HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HE MERELY SAID HE HAD CAUGHT COLD BY BEING OUT TOO LATE IN THE EVENING
I SHOULD THINK NOT
HE WAS FEVERISH AND MUST NOT BE DISTURBED
IN CHILDHOOD I HAD ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO REGARD HIM WITH A FEELING OF REVERENTIAL AWE--BUT LATELY EVEN NOW SURMOUNTED FOR THOUGH HE HAD A FATHERLY KINDNESS FOR THE WELL-BEHAVED HE WAS A STRICT DISCIPLINARIAN AND HAD OFTEN STERNLY REPROVED OUR JUVENILE FAILINGS AND PECCADILLOES
MR WILSON SOON ARRIVED AND INDISPOSED FOR BUSINESS AS I WAS AT THAT MOMENT AND LITTLE AS I CARED FOR THE FIELD OR ITS OWNER I FORCED MY ATTENTION TO THE MATTER IN HAND WITH VERY CREDITABLE DETERMINATION AND QUICKLY CONCLUDED THE BARGAIN--PERHAPS MORE TO THE THRIFTY FARMER'S SATISFACTION THAN HE CARED TO ACKNOWLEDGE
NOBODY MARRIED NO OR--OR EXPECTING TO MARRY?--NO OLD TIES DISSOLVED OR NEW ONES FORMED
AND I WILL GO CRIED I NOT KNOWING WHETHER TO LAUGH OR TO CRY OR TO BREAK OUT INTO A TEMPEST OF FURY
HOW MANY SUCH MEN DO YOU EXPECT TO MEET WITH IN THE WORLD
BUT NOT TILL AFTER TEN WHEN TEA WHICH HAD BEEN DELAYED FOR MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR WAS NEARLY OVER
IF THE COIN SUITS YOU TELL ME SO AND I'LL SEND YOU THE REST AT MY LEISURE
I'M NO TERMAGANT WELL ALL THE BETTER FOR THAT FOR I CAN'T STAND CONTRADICTION IN A GENERAL WAY AND I'M AS FOND OF MY OWN WILL AS ANOTHER
BE ASSURED IT IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE DONE AMISS OR YOUR GENERAL MISCONDUCT THAT DISTRESSES HER I DON'T BELIEVE IT
BUT THEN HE COULD NOT SEE TO WRITE
WHAT IS IT LOWBOROUGH SAID I THINKING HE WAS FAIRLY CRACKED AT LAST
SO WE ARE TO GO TO LONDON ON MONDAY THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW
TELL HER I WANT TO SPEAK TO HER HE RAN TO PERFORM MY BIDDING AND QUICKLY RETURNED WITH HIS MOTHER
BUT SHE WAS TOO POLITE OR TOO MUCH AFRAID OF HER BROTHER'S ANGER TO REFER TO IT
HE STARTED AND STOOD STILL A MOMENT
AT LEAST HE GAVE ME A SPECIMEN OF HIS CHARACTER TO-DAY THAT SEEMED TO MERIT A HARDER NAME THAN THOUGHTLESSNESS
I'LL LEAVE YOU THEN TO PREPARE FOR YOUR DEPARTURE I'VE DONE THAT ALREADY WHILE YOU WERE READING THE LETTER AND BEFORE YOU CAME
CHAPTER V IT WAS ABOUT THE CLOSE OF THE MONTH THAT YIELDING AT LENGTH TO THE URGENT IMPORTUNITIES OF ROSE I ACCOMPANIED HER IN A VISIT TO WILDFELL HALL
AND NEVER GILBERT PUT ME TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW SAID TO YOU SHE EARNESTLY ADDED GIVING ME HER HAND IN SERIOUS KINDNESS
AND SECONDLY WHAT'S MOST AGREEABLE TO THE GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE--ANYTHING WILL DO FOR THE LADIES AND VERY GOOD DOCTRINE TOO SAID MY MOTHER
AND GIVES MY FRIENDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF I PREFER LIVING APART FROM HIM HE WILL INDULGE THE WHIM AND LET ME DO SO UNMOLESTED AND EVEN SETTLE A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE ON ME PROVIDED I WILL IMMEDIATELY DELIVER UP HIS SON
BUT THE MOMENT OF HER ARRIVAL BROUGHT NEW LIFE TO THE HOUSE AND THOUGH I MIGHT NOT NEGLECT THE OTHER GUESTS FOR HER OR EXPECT TO ENGROSS MUCH OF HER ATTENTION AND CONVERSATION TO MYSELF ALONE I ANTICIPATED AN EVENING OF NO COMMON ENJOYMENT
LEAVING HIM THUS HARANGUING THE PEOPLE MORE TO THEIR AMUSEMENT THAN EDIFICATION I RETURNED TO THE HOUSE AND HAVING MADE SOME ALTERATION IN MY TOILET HASTENED AWAY TO WILDFELL HALL WITH THE BOOK IN MY POCKET
BUT AT THAT MOMENT SOME ONE OPENED THE OUTER DOOR AND A VOICE--HER VOICE--SAID,--'COME OUT--I WANT TO SEE THE MOON AND BREATHE THE EVENING AIR
AT PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER RETURN TO THE DRAWING-ROOM BUT MEANTIME PLEADED HE LET ME COMMEND MY CAUSE TO YOUR MOST INDULGENT NO INDULGENCE FOR YOU MR HUNTINGDON MUST COME BETWEEN ME AND THE CONSIDERATION OF MY NIECE'S HAPPINESS AH TRUE
BUT THEY WILL ALL BEAR A DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION TO THAT WHICH IS COMMONLY GIVEN AND IN MOST THE ONLY DIFFICULTY IS IN THE WORD WHICH WE TRANSLATE EVERLASTING OR ETERNAL I DON'T KNOW THE GREEK BUT I BELIEVE IT STRICTLY MEANS FOR AGES AND MIGHT SIGNIFY EITHER ENDLESS OR LONG-ENDURING
I TOLD HIM IN FEW WORDS THAT I COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE HIM DEGRADE HIMSELF SO AND THAT I SHOULD CEASE TO--NO MATTER WHAT I TOLD HIM BUT YOU SEE THE REFORMATION I HAVE WROUGHT
GO TO THE DEUCE REPLIED THE LATTER WITH AN IMPATIENT JERK OF THE HEAD
YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR HOPES DEFEATED
AND DON'T TAKE ANY MORE WINE
BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN WELL THIS LAST DAY OR TWO
IT GIVES ME LITTLE CONSOLATION TO THINK I SHALL NEXT BEHOLD YOU AS A DISEMBODIED SPIRIT OR AN ALTERED BEING WITH A FRAME PERFECT AND GLORIOUS BUT NOT LIKE THIS!--AND A HEART PERHAPS ENTIRELY ESTRANGED FROM ME NO GILBERT THERE IS PERFECT LOVE IN HEAVEN SO PERFECT I SUPPOSE THAT IT SOARS ABOVE DISTINCTIONS AND YOU WILL HAVE NO CLOSER SYMPATHY WITH ME THAN WITH ANY ONE OF THE TEN THOUSAND THOUSAND ANGELS AND THE INNUMERABLE MULTITUDE OF HAPPY SPIRITS ROUND US WHATEVER I AM YOU WILL BE THE SAME AND THEREFORE CANNOT POSSIBLY REGRET IT
BUT IF THAT BEAMING BLUE EYE RESTED ON ME ITS LIGHT WOULD VANISH FOR A MOMENT AND HE WOULD SAY IN SOME CONCERN MAMMA WHY DON'T YOU LAUGH
I GIVE HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT DRINKING MAKES HIS EYES DULL AND HIS FACE RED AND BLOATED
IT WAS FAR INTO THE NIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE TOWN OF L AND STILL WE WERE SEVEN MILES FROM OUR JOURNEY'S END
BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY IT'S DEVILISH PROVOKING NOW THAT WE CAN'T BE JOLLY BECAUSE HE CHOOSES TO BE ON HIS GOOD BEHAVIOUR IT'S ALL THESE CURSED WOMEN MUTTERED GRIMSBY
IT IS MY--DUTY--AS--YOUR PASTOR SAID I TO TELL YOU BOTH EVERYTHING THAT I MYSELF SEE REPREHENSIBLE IN YOUR CONDUCT AND ALL I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT AND WHAT OTHERS TELL ME CONCERNING YOU."--SO I TOLD HER YOU DID SIR CRIED I STARTING FROM MY SEAT AND STRIKING MY FIST ON THE TABLE
THERE WAS A SLIGHT TREMOR IN HER VOICE BUT I THOUGHT HER WHOLE MANNER WAS PROVOKINGLY COMPOSED CONSIDERING THE DREADFUL SENTENCE SHE PRONOUNCED
HARGRAVE PLACED HIS HAND ON MINE THAT RESTED ON THE TABLE AND SQUEEZING IT WITH A FIRM BUT GENTLE PRESSURE MURMURED BEATEN BEATEN AND GAZED INTO MY FACE WITH A LOOK WHERE EXULTATION WAS BLENDED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF ARDOUR AND TENDERNESS YET MORE INSULTING
IF YOU'VE THE HEART OF A MAN IT WOULD BE THE VERY TICKET FOR YOU
HE WAS NOT SO NOISY AS HATTERSLEY BUT HIS FACE WAS EXCEEDINGLY FLUSHED
WHY WON'T YOU WRITE TO ME AT LEAST
I WILL NOT BE MOCKED WITH THE EMPTY HUSK OF CONJUGAL ENDEARMENTS WHEN YOU HAVE GIVEN THE SUBSTANCE TO ANOTHER VERY GOOD IF YOU PLEASE
I THINK NOT
MY COMPANION HOWEVER WAS EVIDENTLY RELIEVED
BUT WHAT A FOOL I WAS
HE LAUGHED INCESSANTLY AND WHILE I BLUSHED FOR ALL I SAW AND HEARD OF HIM I WAS GLAD THAT HE CHOSE TO TALK TO HIS COMPANION IN SO LOW A TONE THAT NO ONE COULD HEAR WHAT HE SAID BUT HERSELF
BUT IT IS WRONG TO DESPAIR
A FEW MORE TOUCHES IN THE FOREGROUND WILL FINISH IT I SHOULD THINK
ON THE CONTRARY I SHOULD LIKE TO WAIT TILL AFTER CHRISTMAS AT LEAST OH
MRS HARGRAVE'S ANXIETY TO MAKE GOOD MATCHES FOR HER DAUGHTERS IS PARTLY THE CAUSE AND PARTLY THE RESULT OF THESE ERRORS
WHAT COULD POSSESS ME TO MAKE SUCH A REQUEST OF SUCH A MAN I CANNOT TELL
IT'S ABOUT THAT SAD MRS GRAHAM HUSH-SH-SH WHISPERED FERGUS IN A TONE OF SOLEMN IMPORT
IT SHOWS A WANT OF CONFIDENCE OH NO CRIED SHE EAGERLY INTERRUPTING ME
WHAT YOU SEE IN HER I DON'T KNOW
THE APPROACH 206 FRONT 222 SIDE 286 INTRODUCTION ANNE BRONTE SERVES A TWOFOLD PURPOSE IN THE STUDY OF WHAT THE BRONTES WROTE AND WERE
OH GILBERT
THE GREATER THE BLISS WE MIGHT ENJOY TOGETHER THE MORE I FEEL OUR PRESENT WRETCHEDNESS APART YES OURS
OCCASIONALLY I RODE OVER TO SEE HER AND ONCE OR TWICE I HAD HER TO SPEND THE DAY WITH ME AT THE MANOR
I CERTAINLY DIDN'T MEAN TO DO SO
BUT WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE THEN IF YOU RECEIVED NO INFORMATION IT WAS NOW MY TURN TO BE CONFOUNDED
IN WHICH CASE I SHALL BE CAREFUL NOT TO TROUBLE MYSELF OR MY READERS IN THE SAME WAY AGAIN
WELL THEN
BUT OF COURSE I KEPT SUCH DREAMS ENTIRELY TO MYSELF
MEANTIME SHE EXULTINGLY SEATED HERSELF AT THE PIANO AND FAVOURED HIM WITH TWO OF HIS FAVOURITE SONGS IN SUCH SUPERIOR STYLE THAT EVEN I SOON LOST MY ANGER IN ADMIRATION AND LISTENED WITH A SORT OF GLOOMY PLEASURE TO THE SKILFUL MODULATIONS OF HER FULL-TONED AND POWERFUL VOICE SO JUDICIOUSLY AIDED BY HER ROUNDED AND SPIRITED TOUCH
AND I SCARCELY CHECKED AN INVOLUNTARY RECOIL AS I ENTERED IT
I WILL DISCUSS THIS MATTER WITH YOU TOO TO-MORROW DON'T BE ANGRY AUNT SAID I
MEANTIME HE EXHORTS ME TO THE EXERCISE OF PATIENCE THAT FIRST OF WOMAN'S VIRTUES AND DESIRES ME TO REMEMBER THE SAYING ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER AND COMFORT MYSELF WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT THE LONGER HE STAYS AWAY THE BETTER HE SHALL LOVE ME WHEN HE RETURNS
NO MISS NOT ALL
SO LEAVING BOTH MEADOW AND HEDGE I QUICKLY REPAIRED TO THE SPOT BUT NOT BEFORE SANCHO WHO IMMEDIATELY UPON PERCEIVING HIS YOUNG FRIEND SCOURED AT FULL GALLOP THE INTERVENING SPACE AND POUNCED UPON HIM WITH AN IMPETUOUS MIRTH THAT PRECIPITATED THE CHILD ALMOST INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE BECK
AND BY-THE-BY CRIED HE AS I WAS LEAVING THE ROOM YOU'D BETTER TELL THAT D--D OLD SNEAK OF A NURSE TO KEEP OUT OF MY WAY FOR A DAY OR TWO
HIS COMPANION SMILED AND HE LEFT THE ROOM
BUT BESIDES MY BITTER INDIGNATION AGAINST HIMSELF THERE WAS THE QUESTION WHAT TO SAY TO HIS SERVANTS--AND WHAT TO MY OWN FAMILY
HE STRUCK IT OFF WITH A SMART BLOW AND THE POOR DOG SQUEAKED AND RAN COWERING BACK TO ME
THE STORY OF HIS DEATH HAS MANY TRUE AND TOUCHING PASSAGES
HE HATH FILLED ME WITH BITTERNESS--HE HATH MADE ME DRUNKEN WITH WORMWOOD I FORGET TO ADD BUT THOUGH HE CAUSE GRIEF YET WILL HE HAVE COMPASSION ACCORDING TO THE MULTITUDE OF HIS MERCIES
HE KEEPS ME NIGHT AND DAY BESIDE HIM
GIVE IT HER YOURSELF YOU BLOCKHEAD CRIED SHE RECOILING WITH A SPRING FROM BETWEEN US
AT LAST HOWEVER I TOLD HER I WAS SENSIBLE OF MY ERROR
AND IF I FULFIL MY THREAT OF PUNISHING HIS SEEMING NEGLECT BY CEASING TO WRITE HE SHALL BE SO ANGRY THAT HE WILL DO HIS UTMOST TO FORGET ME
BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE FRANKNESS SHE REPLIED BECAUSE I HAVE FRIENDS--ACQUAINTANCES AT LEAST--IN THE WORLD FROM WHOM I DESIRE MY PRESENT ABODE TO BE CONCEALED
YOU KNEW IT CRIED HE WITH BITTER VEHEMENCE--'AND YOU DID NOT TELL ME
IT WAS NOT IN ANGER I WAS WELL ASSURED BUT ONLY TO CONCEAL OR CONTROL HER EMOTION
WHEN THE PONY-CARRIAGE HAD APPROACHED AS NEAR WILDFELL HALL AS THE ROAD WOULD PERMIT--UNLESS INDEED IT PROCEEDED UP THE LONG ROUGH LANE WHICH MRS GRAHAM WOULD NOT ALLOW--THE YOUNG WIDOW AND HER SON ALIGHTED RELINQUISHING THE DRIVER'S SEAT TO ROSE
AFTER STARING A MOMENT IN MUTE SURPRISE SHE SAID,--'WELL HELEN I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO CONGRATULATE YOU--AND I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU SO HAPPY
AS IT WAS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP IT FOR HE NOT ONLY BOTHERED ME WITH THE INFLICTION OF HIS OWN PRESENCE BUT HE KEPT ME FROM THE ENJOYMENT OF MORE AGREEABLE SOCIETY
I THINK I HOLD THE SAME OPINION RESPECTING HER AS BEFORE--BUT SLIGHTLY AMELIORATED OH HE LOOKED ROUND FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT
I WANTED NO CONFIDANTE IN MY DISTRESS
THEY'LL MAKE A MATCH OF IT AS SURE AS CAN BE
WHEN THAT WAS OVER ROSE SUMMONED FERGUS TO HELP HER TO GATHER UP THE FRAGMENTS AND THE KNIVES DISHES C AND RESTORE THEM TO THE BASKETS
AND TO THE FARM I WENT NOT TROUBLING MY MIND ONE WHIT ABOUT THE POSSIBLE TRUTH OF THESE MYSTERIOUS REPORTS BUT ONLY WONDERING WHAT THEY WERE BY WHOM ORIGINATED AND ON WHAT FOUNDATIONS RAISED AND HOW THEY COULD THE MOST EFFECTUALLY BE SILENCED OR DISPROVED
I AM SO DETERMINED TO LOVE HIM SO INTENSELY ANXIOUS TO EXCUSE HIS ERRORS THAT I AM CONTINUALLY DWELLING UPON THEM AND LABOURING TO EXTENUATE THE LOOSEST OF HIS PRINCIPLES AND THE WORST OF HIS PRACTICES TILL I AM FAMILIARISED WITH VICE AND ALMOST A PARTAKER IN HIS SINS
BUT THERE WAS ARTHUR PLAYING WITH HIS FROLICSOME LITTLE DOG IN THE GARDEN
HE KNOWS I HAVE NO ONE BUT RACHEL TO SPEAK TO FOR WE HAVE NO NEIGHBOURS HERE EXCEPT THE HARGRAVES WHOSE RESIDENCE I CAN DIMLY DESCRY FROM THESE UPPER WINDOWS EMBOSOMED AMONG THOSE LOW WOODY HILLS BEYOND THE DALE
THAT IS HE'S ALWAYS ON HIS BEST BEHAVIOUR IN YOUR PRESENCE--BUT I WONDER WHAT HIS WORST BEHAVIOUR IS LIKE THEN I COULD NOT FORBEAR OBSERVING
I KNOW ONLY THE EXTERIOR AND WHAT I TRUST IS THE WORST PART OF HIM SHE CONCLUDES WITH GOOD-BY DEAR HELEN
HOW DARE YOU TELL SUCH A LIE I'M NOT CRYING NOW PLEADED SHE
THIS MODE OF PROCEDURE SUITED HIM SO WELL THAT THEREAFTER HE ALWAYS PURSUED THE PLAN OF SHOWING ME HER LETTERS AT ONCE WHEN INQUIRED AFTER HER IF THERE WERE ANY TO SHOW--IT WAS SO MUCH LESS TROUBLE THAN TO TELL ME THEIR CONTENTS
FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO
I ASSURE YOU IT WAS NOT BY MY ADVICE THAT SHE WENT FOR I DETEST THAT MAN AS FERVENTLY AS YOU CAN DO,--EXCEPT INDEED THAT HIS REFORMATION WOULD GIVE ME MUCH GREATER PLEASURE THAN HIS DEATH
WE WERE WALKING HOME FROM THE MORNING SERVICE FOR IT WAS A FINE FROSTY DAY AND AS WE ARE SO NEAR THE CHURCH I HAD REQUESTED THE CARRIAGE SHOULD NOT BE USED
I LOOKED AT HER PALE CHEEK AND GLITTERING EYE BUT ANSWERED NOTHING
NOW MISS WILMOT WON'T YOU GIVE US SOME MUSIC TO-NIGHT SAID HE
AND TURNING FROM HIM I LOOKED ROUND
YOU DID NOT NO I'LL BE SWORN SHE DIDN'T SAID HATTERSLEY OR HE'D NEVER LOOK SO BLACK I'M WILLING TO GRANT YOU THE SATISFACTION OF A GENTLEMAN HUNTINGDON SAID MR HARGRAVE CALMLY ADDRESSING HIS HOST BUT WITH A BITTER SNEER UPON HIS COUNTENANCE
I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND YOU
I WILL NOT GO BACK TO THEM
SHE WENT WITH HER MOTHER WHO OF COURSE WHEN SHE HEARD OF A STRANGER BEING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WOULD BE ON PINS AND NEEDLES TILL SHE HAD SEEN HER AND GOT ALL SHE COULD OUT OF HER
YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO RAISE TWO HUMAN BEINGS FROM A STATE OF ACTUAL SUFFERING TO SUCH UNSPEAKABLE BEATITUDE AS ONLY GENEROUS NOBLE SELF-FORGETTING LOVE CAN GIVE FOR YOU CAN LOVE ME IF YOU WILL
NOW YOU HAVE SPOILED THE SUGAR TOO
A CLEAR RED FIRE WAS BURNING IN THE POLISHED GRATE
AND IF THERE BE NOTHING BUT SORROW FOR ME IN THIS WORLD WHAT IS THE LONGEST LIFE OF MISERY TO A WHOLE ETERNITY OF PEACE
MRS MAXWELL BEGGED ME TO BE SEATED OBSERVING IT WAS RATHER COLD BUT SHE SUPPOSED I HAD NOT TRAVELLED FAR THAT MORNING
THAT SWEET SEASON I ONCE SO JOYOUSLY WELCOMED AS THE TIME OF HOPE AND GLADNESS AWAKENS NOW FAR OTHER ANTICIPATIONS BY ITS RETURN
IF IT BE HARD TO SAY ADIEU FOR EVER YOU OUGHT TO HELP ME SHE PAUSED
HOW CAN I SETTLE MY AFFAIRS WHEN I KNOW THAT YOU ARE HERE NEGLECTED I SHALL NOT FEEL MYSELF NEGLECTED
HELEN SAID SHE AFTER A THOUGHTFUL SILENCE DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT MARRIAGE YES AUNT OFTEN AND DO YOU EVER CONTEMPLATE THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING MARRIED YOURSELF OR ENGAGED BEFORE THE SEASON IS OVER SOMETIMES
YOU NEVER WILL HATE ME RETURNING AND RESUMING HIS FORMER POSITION AT MY FEET HE REPEATED MORE VEHEMENTLY--'YOU CANNOT HATE ME AS LONG AS I LOVE YOU BUT HOW CAN I BELIEVE THAT YOU LOVE ME IF YOU CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY
HELEN EYED ME AS I ENTERED WITH A KIND OF GENTLE SERIOUS SCRUTINY AND POLITELY ASKED AFTER MRS MARKHAM AND ROSE
IF THE VILLAIN MUST DISGRACE THE FAMILY MUST HE BLAZON IT ABROAD TO EVERY LOW-BRED KNAVE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE
I VENTURED TO INQUIRE HER NAME AND ADDRESS BY WHOM SHE HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED OR HOW HE HAD BEEN LED TO MAKE CHOICE OF HER
IT IS HAPPINESS ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WE ARE TO BE UNITED
YOU SHALL SAY YOU ARE SORRY FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WELL WELL I AM YOU ARE NOT
IT IS NO QUESTION OF MERE EXPEDIENCE WITH ME
AND THEN I WOULD LEAVE HIM TO HIS KIND FRIENDS AND RETIRE TO INDULGE MY BITTERNESS AND DESPAIR ALONE OR TO RACK MY BRAINS FOR A REMEDY TO THIS GREAT EVIL
BUT THE JOURNEY WAS A VERY LONG ONE AND WE WERE ALL WEARY ENOUGH BEFORE THE CLOSE OF IT
BUT I CONTINUED CARESSING THE DOG
PERHAPS I MAY RECOVER HE REPLIED
I CANNOT CONSENT TO LOSE YOU
HE HAD FAIRLY BROKEN THE BARRIER
MEANTIME MR GRIMSBY SEATED HIMSELF BY ME IN THE CHAIR VACATED BY HARGRAVE AS THEY ENTERED AND GRAVELY STATED THAT HE WOULD THANK ME FOR A CUP OF TEA
IT SEEMS TO ME RETURNED I THAT SHE IS CASTING HER PEARLS BEFORE SWINE
AND WE DID NOT SLACKEN OUR PACE TILL WE CAME UP WITH MISS WILMOT AND LORD LOWBOROUGH WHICH WAS WITHIN HALF A MILE OF THE PARK-GATES
BUT DON'T YOU SEE I SHOULD BE DRAGGING YOU DOWN WITH ME WHEN YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING TO DESERVE IT OH FIDDLE EJACULATED SHE
I WOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD TO SUPPOSE THAT THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNHAPPY SCAPEGRACE WITH HIS FEW PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS I HAVE HERE INTRODUCED ARE A SPECIMEN OF THE COMMON PRACTICES OF SOCIETY--THE CASE IS AN EXTREME ONE AS I TRUSTED NONE WOULD FAIL TO PERCEIVE
BUT AS USUAL I HAVE REAPED THE BITTER FRUITS OF MY OWN ERROR,--AND MUST REAP THEM TO THE END BITTER INDEED WAS THE TONE OF ANGUISH REPRESSED BY RESOLUTE FIRMNESS IN WHICH THIS WAS SPOKEN
SHE'LL BE A FINE CATCH FOR SOMEBODY SHE WILL SO
YOU HEAR JUST AS MUCH OF AN ARGUMENT AS YOU PLEASE
I'VE HAD MANY A LAUGH AT THE BOOBIES AND BEDLAMITES
IT IS--LET--ME--SEE HE CONTINUED SLOWLY AS HE DEPOSITED HIS PONDEROUS BULK IN THE ARM-CHAIR THAT ROSE OFFICIOUSLY BROUGHT TOWARDS HIM
AND HAVING BEGGED MISS MILLWARD TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER PRECIOUS SON AND STRICTLY ENJOINED HIM NOT TO WANDER FROM HIS NEW GUARDIAN'S SIDE SHE LEFT US AND PROCEEDED ALONG THE STEEP STONY HILL TO A LOFTIER MORE PRECIPITOUS EMINENCE AT SOME DISTANCE WHENCE A STILL FINER PROSPECT WAS TO BE HAD WHERE SHE PREFERRED TAKING HER SKETCH THOUGH SOME OF THE LADIES TOLD HER IT WAS A FRIGHTFUL PLACE AND ADVISED HER NOT TO ATTEMPT IT
I REPLIED BY A WRATHFUL AND CONTEMPTUOUS STARE
THE CHILD WENT AND TIMIDLY TOUCHED THAT BURNING HAND BUT ALMOST STARTED IN ALARM WHEN HIS FATHER SUDDENLY CLUTCHED HIS ARM AND DREW HIM NEARER TO HIS SIDE
NOW TOO I SAW A REASON FOR MANY LITTLE THINGS THAT HAD SLIGHTLY PUZZLED ME BEFORE
AND IS IT NOTHING TO MAKE IT YOUR SPORT TO BREAK THEM AND TO TEMPT ANOTHER TO DO THE SAME
YOU MIGHT AS WELL SELL YOURSELF TO SLAVERY AT ONCE AS MARRY A MAN YOU DISLIKE
BUT STILL HE LOOKED UPON MY PROJECT AS WILD AND IMPRACTICABLE
HE HAS REALISED HIS MOTHER'S BRIGHTEST EXPECTATIONS AND IS AT PRESENT RESIDING IN GRASSDALE MANOR WITH HIS YOUNG WIFE--THE MERRY LITTLE HELEN HATTERSLEY OF YORE
WHY DID YOU LET THE DOG OUT HE ASKED
I DATE THE TIME OF THIS IMPROVEMENT FROM THE PERIOD WHEN SHE CEASED TO HOPE AND STRIVE FOR ARTHUR'S ADMIRATION
SHE IS THE MEASURE OF THEIR GENIUS--LIKE THEM YET NOT WITH THEM
WITH YOUR GOOD LOOKS AND POWERS OF FASCINATION HE WAS PLEASED TO SAY I MIGHT HOPE
I WOULD NOT UPBRAID HIM THEN
HE EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT HAVING TO LEAVE ME BUT HOPED I WOULD AMUSE MYSELF WITH THE BABY TILL HE RETURNED
STAY A MOMENT SAID SHE
I DEFERRED IT HOWEVER TILL THE EVENING WHEN MY SPIRITS WERE MORE COMPOSED AND WHEN--OH WONDERFUL PERVERSITY OF HUMAN NATURE!--SOME FAINT GERMS OF INDEFINITE HOPES WERE BEGINNING TO RISE IN MY MIND
LET ME PROTECT YOU NEVER
SHE SUNK AT LENGTH IN DIFFICULTY AND DEBT DISGRACE AND MISERY
AND FROM THE INCOHERENT HALF-UTTERED WORDS THAT ESCAPED HIM FROM TIME TO TIME SUPPOSING HIM TO BE NOW UNCONSCIOUS I GENTLY DISENGAGED MY HAND FROM HIS INTENDING TO STEAL AWAY FOR A BREATH OF AIR FOR I WAS ALMOST READY TO FAINT
I HOPE HIS GOOD RESOLUTIONS WILL NOT FALL THROUGH AND POOR MILICENT WILL NOT BE AGAIN DISAPPOINTED
THIS STRUCK ME AS TERRIBLE NEWS AT THE MOMENT
SHE IS A CHARMING CREATURE BUT HER BLITHE SPIRIT IS ALMOST BROKEN AND HER SWEET TEMPER ALMOST SPOILED BY THE STILL UNREMITTING PERSECUTIONS OF HER MOTHER IN BEHALF OF HER REJECTED SUITOR--NOT VIOLENT BUT WEARISOME AND UNREMITTING LIKE A CONTINUAL DROPPING
WHAT WILL YOU SAY?--THAT IS THE QUESTION
SHE HAD BROUGHT HER KNITTING WITH HER AND IT SEEMED AS IF HER TONGUE HAD LAID A WAGER WITH HER FINGERS TO OUTDO THEM IN SWIFT AND CEASELESS MOTION
AND THE MOST SINGULAR AND PERTINACIOUS OF THEM ALL IS YOUR FACE AND VOICE--THEY SEEM JUST LIKE HERS
AND WITH A FIRM AND STEADY TREAD I PACED THE GARDEN-WALK
BUT WHERE CAN YOU GO
BUT STILL I REPEAT STAND FIRM
SAY WHAT REPLIED I
I AM PERFECTLY CALM
SEEING AS MUCH COMPANY AS SHE CAN WITHOUT TOO MUCH EXPENSE BUT LOVING NO ONE AND BELOVED BY NONE--A COLD-HEARTED SUPERCILIOUS KEENLY INSIDIOUSLY CENSORIOUS OLD MAID
I SHALL LOOK OUT FOR A STEWARD MY DEAR--I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO THE TEMPTATION
HE THEN SENT FOR THE COACHMAN AND I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT THE CARRIAGE AND THE HORSES AND LONDON AND SEVEN O'CLOCK TO-MORROW MORNING THAT STARTLED AND DISTURBED ME NOT A LITTLE
THE SCRIPTURES ARE OPEN TO HIM AS WELL AS TO OTHERS;--AND IF HE HEAR NOT THEM NEITHER WILL HE HEAR THOUGH ONE ROSE FROM THE DEAD AND REMEMBER HELEN CONTINUED SHE SOLEMNLY THE WICKED SHALL BE TURNED INTO HELL AND THEY THAT FORGET GOD AND SUPPOSE EVEN THAT HE SHOULD CONTINUE TO LOVE YOU AND YOU HIM AND THAT YOU SHOULD PASS THROUGH LIFE TOGETHER WITH TOLERABLE COMFORT--HOW WILL IT BE IN THE END WHEN YOU SEE YOURSELVES PARTED FOR EVER
THOUGH AS I AFTERWARDS DISCOVERED WHEN I CAME TO ANALYSE IT IT WAS CHIEFLY CONFINED TO QUIZZING THE DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY PRESENT
FOR YOU HAVE RELIEVED MY MIND OF TWO GREAT BURDENS--ANXIETY ON MY SISTER'S ACCOUNT AND DEEP REGRET UPON YOUR OWN
I HAVEN'T HAD TIME YET TO EXAMINE THOROUGHLY INTO THIS YOUNG RASCAL'S AFFAIRS BUT I SEE THAT A GREAT PART OF HIS FATHER'S FINE PROPERTY HAS BEEN SQUANDERED AWAY;--BUT STILL I THINK THERE'S A PRETTY FAIR SHARE OF IT LEFT AND A LITTLE CAREFUL NURSING MAY MAKE A HANDSOME THING OF IT YET
BUT YOU DID NOT SAY SO BEFORE WHEN YOU URGED ME TO LEAVE YOU IN ORDER THAT YOU MIGHT GET AWAY FROM YOUR HOME WITHOUT ME RETORTED I
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT SHE HAD LEFT ME FOR THAT MAN
THERE THERE DO SPARE ME A LITTLE ARTHUR YOU MUST REPENT CRIED I IN A FRENZY OF DESPERATION THROWING MY ARMS AROUND HIM AND BURYING MY FACE IN HIS BOSOM
HAL-LO MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK
SO YOU CAN PLEASE YOURSELF MA'AM HER VOICE QUAVERED AS SHE SPOKE AND THE TEARS STOOD IN HER EYES
BUT I THINK IF LOWBOROUGH WERE TO COMMIT SUCH IMPROPRIETIES I'D MAKE HIM CRY
GIVE IT ME DIRECTLY--I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU IF YOU DON'T BUT THE MORE VEHEMENTLY I INSISTED THE MORE HE AGGRAVATED MY DISTRESS BY HIS INSULTING GLEEFUL LAUGH
I GOT UP TO STIR THE FIRE
BUT YOU SEE I CAN'T MANAGE IT
BUT KNOW THOU THAT FOR ALL THESE THINGS GOD WILL BRING THEE INTO JUDGMENT WELL BUT HELEN I'M SURE I'VE BEEN VERY GOOD THESE LAST FEW WEEKS
SUN SHINES OUT--RAIN CEASED--EVEN BOARHAM'S NOT AFRAID TO VENTURE IN HIS WATERPROOF BOOTS
HARGRAVE AND ANNABELLA FROM DIFFERENT MOTIVES AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS EMULATED ME AND DOUBTLESS BOTH SURPASSED ME THE FORMER IN HIS DISCURSIVE VERSATILITY AND ELOQUENCE THE LATTER IN BOLDNESS AND ANIMATION AT LEAST
AND WHEN THAT IMPORTANT BUSINESS WAS COMPLETED I REPAIRED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM WHERE I FOUND MR AND MISS WILMOT AND MILICENT HARGRAVE ALREADY ASSEMBLED
IT WAS NOW SOMETHING MORE TO HIM THAN AN ACCESSORY TO SOCIAL ENJOYMENT
AND FINALLY I HAVE AN AVERSION TO HIS WHOLE PERSON THAT I NEVER CAN SURMOUNT THEN YOU OUGHT TO SURMOUNT IT
THEN ON A GLORIOUS MORNING WE GATHERED OUR FORCES AND SET FORTH
STARTLED ALMOST APPALLED BY THIS SUDDEN OUTBREAK SHE RECOILED IN SILENCE
WHILE TAKING HIS COFFEE HE MUTTERED IT WAS D--D COLD YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT IT SO LONG SAID I
YOU MUST GIVE US A LITTLE MORE LICENCE FOR AS SHAKESPEARE HAS IT HOWEVER WE DO PRAISE OURSELVES OUR FANCIES ARE MORE GIDDY AND UNFIRM MORE LONGING WAVERING SOONER LOST AND WON THAN WOMEN'S ARE DO YOU MEAN BY THAT THAT YOUR FANCIES ARE LOST TO ME AND WON BY LADY LOWBOROUGH NO
AND WHEN I DEPARTED I HAD INTENDED THAT MY NEW ABODE SHOULD BE UNKNOWN TO YOU AS TO THE REST OF THE WORLD
AND NO TIME NEED NOW BE WASTED UPON UNRAVELLING THE SORDID MYSTERY
MUCH AS I HAD LONGED FOR THEIR COMING MY HEART FAILED ME AT THE RIOTOUS UPROAR OF THEIR APPROACH
BUT ARTHUR IS NOT NATURALLY A PEEVISH OR IRRITABLE MAN
FRAID THERE'S NO CHANCE FOR UZ'--(FACETIOUSLY JOGGING ME WITH HIS ELBOW AS WELL AS HIS COMPANION)--'HA HA HA
NOT THAT I INTENDED TO CHERISH THEM AFTER ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT BUT THERE THEY MUST LIE FOR A WHILE UNCRUSHED THOUGH NOT ENCOURAGED TILL I HAD LEARNT TO LIVE WITHOUT THEM
HE WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THIS
FOR THERE WAS MRS GRAHAM SLOWLY MOVING DOWN THE WALK WITH ARTHUR BY HER SIDE AND NO ONE ELSE
AND MUST WE NEVER MEET AGAIN I MURMURED IN THE ANGUISH OF MY SOUL
IS THIS SUCH AN EVERY-DAY CHARACTER THAT YOU SHOULD REJECT THE POSSESSOR OF SUCH NOBLE QUALITIES WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION
ALREADY SHE HAS ENNOBLED ME IN MY OWN ESTIMATION AND MADE ME THREE TIMES BETTER WISER GREATER THAN I WAS
I BEG YOUR PARDON MRS HUNTINGDON
COME MY LAD HE MUTTERED
THIS IS A KIND OF INJUSTICE I CANNOT PATIENTLY ENDURE
I COULDN'T STAND THAT AND FINALLY SHOULD YOU WISH YOUR WIFE TO BE READY TO SINK INTO THE EARTH WHEN SHE HEARS YOU MENTIONED
OH THIS CONFOUNDED RAIN HE MUTTERED
WILL YOU TELL HER NO
THE INTERVIEW MAY BE SERVICEABLE TO HER OR IT MAY NOT
FOR THOUGH HE REFUSED TO DRINK LIKE AN HONEST CHRISTIAN IT WAS WELL KNOWN TO ME THAT HE KEPT A PRIVATE BOTTLE OF LAUDANUM ABOUT HIM WHICH HE WAS CONTINUALLY SOAKING AT--OR RATHER HOLDING OFF AND ON WITH ABSTAINING ONE DAY AND EXCEEDING THE NEXT--JUST LIKE THE SPIRITS
BUT IF IT WERE SO YOU WOULD EXACTLY SUIT ME FOR A COMPANION I AM ALL YOU WISH THEN IN OTHER RESPECTS NO I DON'T MEAN THAT
FOR THERE WAS MORE THAN THIS
IT ISN'T TOO LATE IS IT NO
BUT I SOON BEGAN TO REGRET MY PRECIPITANCY IN LEAVING HER SO SOON
DARE YOU SUSPECT ME MR HATTERSLEY SAID I ALMOST BESIDE MYSELF WITH FURY
ONCE OR TWICE SHE WAS PROVOKED TO LAUGHTER BY THE WIT OR THE MERRIMENT OF SOME FAVOURED INDIVIDUAL AMONGST US
OH I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE COME WALTER CRIED HIS SISTER
AND THEN I ASKED AFTER HIS MOTHER AND SISTER
IT SEEMED ALL DIM AND QUIVERING NOW TO MY DARKENED SIGHT
BUT LOOK HERE HELEN--WHAT CAN A MAN DO WITH SUCH A HEAD AS THIS THE HEAD LOOKED RIGHT ENOUGH BUT WHEN HE PLACED MY HAND ON THE TOP OF IT IT SUNK IN A BED OF CURLS RATHER ALARMINGLY LOW ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDDLE
I HAD SAID AN UNJUST AND CRUEL THING
AND UPON THE WHOLE OUR INTIMACY WAS RATHER A MUTUAL PREDILECTION THAN A DEEP AND SOLID FRIENDSHIP SUCH AS HAS SINCE ARISEN BETWEEN MYSELF AND YOU HALFORD WHOM IN SPITE OF YOUR OCCASIONAL CRUSTINESS I CAN LIKEN TO NOTHING SO WELL AS AN OLD COAT UNIMPEACHABLE IN TEXTURE BUT EASY AND LOOSE--THAT HAS CONFORMED ITSELF TO THE SHAPE OF THE WEARER AND WHICH HE MAY USE AS HE PLEASES WITHOUT BEING BOTHERED WITH THE FEAR OF SPOILING IT;--WHEREAS MR LAWRENCE WAS LIKE A NEW GARMENT ALL VERY NEAT AND TRIM TO LOOK AT BUT SO TIGHT IN THE ELBOWS THAT YOU WOULD FEAR TO SPLIT THE SEAMS BY THE UNRESTRICTED MOTION OF YOUR ARMS AND SO SMOOTH AND FINE IN SURFACE THAT YOU SCRUPLE TO EXPOSE IT TO A SINGLE DROP OF RAIN
MY MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME WAS GRAHAM AND THEREFORE I FANCY I HAVE SOME CLAIM TO IT AND PREFER IT TO ANY OTHER EXCEPT MY OWN WHICH I DARE NOT RESUME
BUT WELL NEVER MIND
BUT YOU NEEDN'T SHRINK AWAY FROM ME AS IF I WERE YOUR GREATEST ENEMY
WHAT TREMBLING JOY IT WAS WHEN THE LITTLE WICKET CLOSED BEHIND US AS WE ISSUED FROM THE PARK
ALL NOVELS ARE OR SHOULD BE WRITTEN FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN TO READ AND I AM AT A LOSS TO CONCEIVE HOW A MAN SHOULD PERMIT HIMSELF TO WRITE ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE REALLY DISGRACEFUL TO A WOMAN OR WHY A WOMAN SHOULD BE CENSURED FOR WRITING ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE PROPER AND BECOMING FOR A MAN
BEFORE I COULD SPEAK TO RELIEVE HER FROM SUCH A PERPLEXITY SHE BROKE THE SILENCE HERSELF BY SUDDENLY TURNING TOWARDS ME AND OBSERVING YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY BEFORE--AS FAR I MEAN AS REGARDS ASSURING ME OF YOUR KINDLY RECOLLECTIONS AND YOURSELF OF MINE IF YOU HAD WRITTEN TO ME I WOULD HAVE DONE SO BUT I DID NOT KNOW YOUR ADDRESS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK YOUR BROTHER BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE WOULD OBJECT TO MY WRITING
SURELY YOU NEVER WILL LEARN TO CONDUCT YOURSELF LIKE A LADY WELL MAMMA YOU SAID YOURSELF BUT THE YOUNG LADY WAS SILENCED BY THE UPLIFTED FINGER OF HER MAMMA ACCOMPANIED WITH A VERY STERN SHAKE OF THE HEAD
MRS GRAHAM DARTED UPON ME--HER NECK UNCOVERED HER BLACK LOCKS STREAMING IN THE WIND
GRIMSBY INSTANTLY PRESENTED HIMSELF
HE IS PLEASED WITH MY ATTENTIONS--IT MAY BE GRATEFUL FOR THEM
AND ARTHUR OR MR HUNTINGDON AS I PREFER CALLING HIM FOR THE OTHER IS MY CHILD'S NAME HAD THE GRATUITOUS INSOLENCE TO COME OUT IN HIS DRESSING-GOWN TO BID HIS FRIEND GOOD-BY
I'LL VOUCH FOR THAT WALTER DID NOT ANSWER BUT WALKED TO THE WINDOW TO COLLECT HIS FACULTIES
AND SO AM I SAID HE
AND I TRUSTED THEY WOULD NOT AFFLICT THEMSELVES ON MY ACCOUNT FOR IF I COULD ONLY REACH MY RETREAT IN SAFETY AND KEEP IT UNMOLESTED I SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY BUT FOR THE THOUGHTS OF THEM
AND IF ANY INHABITANT OF ITS VICINITY HAD CHANCED TO SEE US THEN AS WE BOWLED ALONG ON THE TOP OF THE COACH I SCARCELY THINK THEY WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED OUR IDENTITY
TO TALK OF THE PAST WAS TO TORTURE HIM WITH VAIN REMORSE
THERE ARE NO TEMPTATIONS ON THE MOUNTAINS
IF HE HAD SOME ONE TO ADVISE HIM AND REMIND HIM OF WHAT IS RIGHT HE WOULD SOON LEARN YOU THINK--AND YOU YOURSELF WOULD WILLINGLY UNDERTAKE TO BE HIS TEACHER
TASTE IT SUGGESTED I
I'M NOT GOING TO SAID I SOMEWHAT TESTILY THOUGH WITHOUT A GRAIN OF ANGER IN MY HEART AGAINST ANY ONE BUT THE MEDDLING OLD WOMAN
I MUST NOT LET HIM GO TO LONDON WHATEVER COMES OF IT SAID I TO MYSELF
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE HER BLACK HAIR I THOUGHT LIGHT HAIR WOULD SUIT HER BETTER
GOOD-NIGHT
IN LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT THE PARTY BREAK UP MUCH TO MY SORROW FOR EVERY DAY I ENJOY IT MORE AND MORE--NOW THAT MESSRS
HE HAS WON HIS FATHER'S HEART AT LAST
AND THOUGH I HARDLY CAN SAY I WISH YOU TO FORGET ME I KNOW IT IS RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD BOTH FOR YOUR OWN HAPPINESS AND THAT OF YOUR FUTURE WIFE;--AND THEREFORE I MUST AND WILL WISH IT SHE ADDED RESOLUTELY
AT ALL EVENTS WHEN I LOOKED BACK FIVE MINUTES AFTER NOT A TRACE OF EITHER WAS TO BE SEEN
HE PLAYFULLY ABUSES ME FOR THE GALL AND VINEGAR OF MY LATEST EFFUSION TELLS ME I CAN HAVE NO CONCEPTION OF THE MULTITUDINOUS ENGAGEMENTS THAT KEEP HIM AWAY BUT AVERS THAT IN SPITE OF THEM ALL HE WILL ASSUREDLY BE WITH ME BEFORE THE CLOSE OF NEXT WEEK
MR LAWRENCE AND HIS PONY HAD BOTH ALTERED THEIR POSITIONS IN SOME DEGREE
AND THOUGH I AM BOUND TO ATTRIBUTE MUCH OF THE SEVERITY OF MY CENSORS TO THIS SUSPICION I MAKE NO EFFORT TO REFUTE IT BECAUSE IN MY OWN MIND I AM SATISFIED THAT IF A BOOK IS A GOOD ONE IT IS SO WHATEVER THE SEX OF THE AUTHOR MAY BE
THEN FOR HER TOO AS FOR HER SISTERS THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN THE POWER OF MAKING OUT COULD TURN LONELINESS AND DISAPPOINTMENT INTO RICHES AND CONTENT
FOR I DO BELIEVE THESE TWO SOURCES OF TORMENT HAVE HAD MORE EFFECT IN WORKING ME UP INTO A FEVER THAN ANYTHING ELSE
I DON'T WONDER AT YOUR BEING ANGRY FOR I'M SURE I'D GIVE MY HUSBAND A LESSON HE WOULD NOT SOON FORGET FOR A LIGHTER OFFENCE THAN THAT
BUT HE LOST HIS BRIDE BY LOSING HIS FORTUNE
IF SHE DID AS SURELY SHE WOULD IN SOME FASHION MY FUTURE PROCEEDINGS SHOULD BE REGULATED BY HER REPLY
I MUST NOT SEE AGAIN--THEN WALKED A FEW STEPS FURTHER
THE EFFECT OF THE WHOLE HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL MY SYMPATHY FOR HER AND MY FURY AGAINST HIM WAS TO RELIEVE MY MIND OF AN INTOLERABLE BURDEN AND FILL MY HEART WITH JOY AS IF SOME FRIEND HAD ROUSED ME FROM A DREADFUL NIGHTMARE
I FLATTER MYSELF AT TIMES THAT THOUGH AMONG THEM I AM NOT OF THEM
IT WAS ABOUT MIDDAY WHEN WE REACHED THE PLACE OF OUR DESTINATION
YOU KNOW IT WAS REPORTED A MONTH AGO THAT SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO TAKE WILDFELL HALL--AND--WHAT DO YOU THINK
HIS WIFE HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM AS MUCH FOR THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HER DEAR FRIEND FROM WHOM SHE HAD BEEN PARTED SO LONG AS TO VISIT HER MOTHER AND SISTER
AND NOW INSTEAD OF REGRETTING THAT I DID NOT DISCERN HIS FULL CHARACTER BEFORE I WAS INDISSOLUBLY BOUND TO HIM I AM GLAD FOR IT HAS SAVED ME A GREAT DEAL OF BATTLING WITH MY CONSCIENCE AND A GREAT DEAL OF CONSEQUENT TROUBLE AND PAIN
MILICENT CAME AND BEGAN TO ADMIRE MY DRAWINGS AND MAKE REMARKS UPON THEM
AND NOW MY CONSTANT TERROR IS LEST HE SHOULD BE RUINED BY THAT FATHER'S THOUGHTLESS INDULGENCE
SURELY I HAVE NOW GOT DOWN TO THE LOWEST GRADATION IN ARTHUR'S AFFECTION AND DISCOVERED ALL THE EVILS OF HIS NATURE
FOR ADDED SHE IN A LOW TREMULOUS ACCENT WITHDRAWING HER HAND FROM HIS ARM AND BENDING HER LOOKS ON THE RUG IF YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU DON'T AND IT CAN'T BE HELPED VERY TRUE
THE HOUSE IS OLD THE TREES ARE BARE MOONLESS ABOVE BENDS TWILIGHT'S DOME BUT WHAT ON EARTH IS HALF SO DEAR SO LONGED FOR--AS THE HEARTH OF HOME
THE WORLD WAS NOTHING TO HIM
SHE HAD TWO SONS ROBERT A ROUGH COUNTRIFIED FARMER AND RICHARD A RETIRING STUDIOUS YOUNG MAN WHO WAS STUDYING THE CLASSICS WITH THE VICAR'S ASSISTANCE PREPARING FOR COLLEGE WITH A VIEW TO ENTER THE CHURCH
SHE WAS AS MUCH DISTRESSED AND HORRIFIED AS I WAS--AND MORE SO THAN I WAS THAT NIGHT FOR I WAS PARTLY STUNNED BY THE BLOW AND PARTLY EXCITED AND SUPPORTED AGAINST IT BY THE BITTERNESS OF MY WRATH
YET I DO MY PART TO SAVE HIM STILL
AS FOR ARTHUR HE WOULD SHOUT HIS WELCOME FROM AFAR AND RUN TO MEET ME FIFTY YARDS FROM HIS MOTHER'S SIDE
AND WHEN HE HAS SUFFICIENTLY DIVERTED HIMSELF WITH THAT OR FEARS MY DISPLEASURE WILL BECOME TOO SERIOUS FOR HIS COMFORT HE TRIES TO KISS AND SOOTHE ME INTO SMILES AGAIN--NEVER WERE HIS CARESSES SO LITTLE WELCOME AS THEN
IT'S A PITY ISN'T IT SAID I
I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT BUT YOU MAY BELIEVE IT
OR PERHAPS FROM SOMETHING THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEIR MASTER AND HER DURING HER FORMER VISIT
IF IT WERE NOT FOR YOUR SITUATION HELEN I WOULD NOT SUBMIT TO IT SO TAMELY
YOU KNOW NOTHING OF HER FORMER LIFE
FOR HIS FAVOURITE AMUSEMENT IS TO SIT OR LOLL BESIDE ME ON THE SOFA AND TELL ME STORIES OF HIS FORMER AMOURS ALWAYS TURNING UPON THE RUIN OF SOME CONFIDING GIRL OR THE COZENING OF SOME UNSUSPECTING HUSBAND
I NEVER SHALL UNLESS YOU BITTERLY DISAPPOINT ME
I ADORE ANNABELLA BUT I DON'T LOVE HER
HE UNLOCKED IT AND EXAMINED THE CONTENTS BUT SAID NOTHING ABOUT THEM
I SAW BY HIS FACE THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FROM THE EFFECTS OF AN OVERDOSE OF HIS INSIDIOUS COMFORTER
THERE WAS NONE TO BE HAD
NOT ONLY IS IT MAKING A FOOL OF THE BOY BUT IT IS DESPISING THE GIFTS OF PROVIDENCE AND TEACHING HIM TO TRAMPLE THEM UNDER HIS FEET HE THEN ENTERED MORE FULLY INTO THE QUESTION AND EXPLAINED AT LARGE THE FOLLY AND IMPIETY OF SUCH A PROCEEDING
NONE OF OUR GENTLEMEN HAD THE SMALLEST PRETENSIONS TO A LITERARY TASTE EXCEPT MR HARGRAVE
BUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF YOUR CONDUCT TO LADY LOWBOROUGH IS NOT REFERABLE TO WINE
IS HE GONE SAID I
NOW I SHALL BE MY OWN MAN AGAIN AND FEEL RATHER MORE AT MY EASE CHAPTER XXXIX MY GREATEST SOURCE OF UNEASINESS IN THIS TIME OF TRIAL WAS MY SON WHOM HIS FATHER AND HIS FATHER'S FRIENDS DELIGHTED TO ENCOURAGE IN ALL THE EMBRYO VICES A LITTLE CHILD CAN SHOW AND TO INSTRUCT IN ALL THE EVIL HABITS HE COULD ACQUIRE--IN A WORD TO MAKE A MAN OF HIM WAS ONE OF THEIR STAPLE AMUSEMENTS
IS SHE THERE THEN YES BUT IN A DAY OR TWO SHE WILL LEAVE IT TO ACCOMPANY MRS MAXWELL TO F FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SEA AIR AND I SHALL GO WITH THEM F WAS AT THAT TIME A QUIET BUT RESPECTABLE WATERING-PLACE
HOW STRANGE THAT THE INSTINCTIVE IMPULSE OF AFFECTION SHOULD COME FIRST AND THEN THE SHOCK OF THE SURPRISE
I DARED NOT SPEAK LEST MY EMOTION SHOULD OVERMASTER ME
BUT HAPPILY THE STONES PRESERVED HIM FROM ANY SERIOUS WETTING WHILE THEIR SMOOTHNESS PREVENTED HIS BEING TOO MUCH HURT TO LAUGH AT THE UNTOWARD EVENT
AND THANK HEAVEN I AM A MOTHER TOO
I'M RESOLVED TO HAVE DONE WITH IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SHOOT YOURSELF SAID I
ALAS UNHAPPY MAN
BUT I DON'T WISH TO TROUBLE HER WITH MY FEELINGS TILL I KNOW WHETHER I OUGHT TO INDULGE THEM OR NOT
BUT HELEN I'VE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU BEFORE I GO WHAT IS IT NO NOT NOW--I DON'T KNOW YET PRECISELY WHAT IT IS OR HOW TO SAY IT REPLIED I WITH MORE TRUTH THAN WISDOM
AND RACHEL WAS MUFFLED IN A GREY CLOAK AND HOOD THAT HAD SEEN BETTER DAYS AND GAVE HER MORE THE APPEARANCE OF AN ORDINARY THOUGH DECENT OLD WOMAN THAN OF A LADY'S-MAID
JUST WHEN I LOVE YOU MORE THAN EVER FOR THAT VERY REASON IF IT BE SO WE SHOULD NOT MEET AGAIN
WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT MY REAL DISPOSITION AND PRINCIPLES SHE WAS EVIDENTLY PREJUDICED AGAINST ME AND SEEMED BENT UPON SHOWING ME THAT HER OPINIONS RESPECTING ME ON EVERY PARTICULAR FELL FAR BELOW THOSE I ENTERTAINED OF MYSELF
I WAS RALLIED FROM SEVERAL QUARTERS FOR MY ABSTRACTION AND UNGALLANT NEGLECT OF THE LADIES
I CAN'T STAND SUCH A MANIA AS THIS
BUT AT DINNER WHEN AFTER BREAKFASTING AT TWELVE O'CLOCK ON A BOTTLE OF SODA-WATER AND A CUP OF STRONG COFFEE AND LUNCHING AT TWO ON ANOTHER BOTTLE OF SODA-WATER MINGLED WITH BRANDY HE WAS FINDING FAULT WITH EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE AND DECLARING WE MUST CHANGE OUR COOK I THOUGHT THE TIME WAS COME
BUT ANSWER ME THIS ONE QUESTION FIRST;--DO YOU LOVE ME I WILL NOT ANSWER IT THEN I WILL CONCLUDE YOU DO
I'VE SUFFERINGS ENOUGH WITHOUT THAT
HE CANNOT LINGER LONG
I AM BETTER SATISFIED WITH THINGS AS THEY ARE FOR MY OWN PART
AT ANY RATE SHE SAW THAT HER LOQUACIOUS VIVACITY ANNOYED ME AS I COULD TELL BY THE MALICIOUS PERTINACITY WITH WHICH SHE PERSISTED
AND HE SEEMED DISPOSED TO BE GENEROUS ENOUGH ON THAT POINT I KNEW HE WOULD SAID I
IT WAS THE PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN IN THE FULL PRIME OF YOUTHFUL MANHOOD--HANDSOME ENOUGH AND NOT BADLY EXECUTED
THEN LET ME ADD THAT I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT YOU AND IF YOU ANSWER NO TO THIS LAST QUESTION YOU WILL DRIVE ME MAD.--WILL YOU BESTOW YOURSELF UPON ME?--YOU WILL HE CRIED NEARLY SQUEEZING ME TO DEATH IN HIS ARMS
FOR BOTH LORD LOWBOROUGH AND ARTHUR HUNTINGDON HAVE OF LATE ALMOST DAILY NEGLECTED THE SHOOTING EXCURSIONS TO ACCOMPANY US IN OUR VARIOUS RIDES AND RAMBLES
I AM TOLD THAT IF I ABSTAIN FROM THIS TO-DAY I SHALL HAVE A SUMPTUOUS FEAST TO-MORROW CONSISTING OF ALL MANNER OF DAINTIES AND DELICACIES
MR HARGRAVE HAS ANNOYED ME ALL DAY LONG WITH HIS SERIOUS SYMPATHISING AND AS HE THINKS UNOBTRUSIVE POLITENESS
AND IMMEDIATELY RETURNING TO THE TABLE I EMPLOYED MYSELF IN MAKING THE TEA
I FELT FOR HIM ALL THE TIME AND LONGED TO BE RECONCILED
RALLYING IN AN INSTANT WITH THE MOST ENVIABLE ASSURANCE HE BEGAN,--'I BEG TEN THOUSAND PARDONS MRS MAXWELL
SHE HAD A FINE VOICE AND COULD SING LIKE A NIGHTINGALE AND ACCOMPANY HERSELF SUFFICIENTLY WELL ON THE PIANO
AND AS IT WAS OF THE LAST IMPORTANCE THAT OUR FUTURE ABODE SHOULD BE UNKNOWN TO HIM AND HIS ACQUAINTANCE I SHOULD DISCLOSE IT TO NO ONE BUT MY BROTHER THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF WHOM I HOPED STILL TO CORRESPOND WITH MY FRIENDS
BUT IF I HATE THE SINS I LOVE THE SINNER AND WOULD DO MUCH FOR HIS SALVATION EVEN SUPPOSING YOUR SUSPICIONS TO BE MAINLY TRUE WHICH I DO NOT AND WILL NOT BELIEVE WELL MY DEAR ASK YOUR UNCLE WHAT SORT OF COMPANY HE KEEPS AND IF HE IS NOT BANDED WITH A SET OF LOOSE PROFLIGATE YOUNG MEN WHOM HE CALLS HIS FRIENDS HIS JOLLY COMPANIONS AND WHOSE CHIEF DELIGHT IS TO WALLOW IN VICE AND VIE WITH EACH OTHER WHO CAN RUN FASTEST AND FURTHEST DOWN THE HEADLONG ROAD TO THE PLACE PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS THEN I WILL SAVE HIM FROM THEM OH HELEN HELEN
I PAUSED AT THE GATE TO WIPE MY STREAMING FOREHEAD AND RECOVER MY BREATH AND SOME DEGREE OF COMPOSURE
I CANNOT EXPRESS MY JOY
NEVER HAD MY HEART SO WARMLY CLEAVED TO HER AS NOW
MARY A
MESSRS
CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT HAD STARTLED HER SO I LOOKED TOWARDS THE WINDOW--FOR HER EYES HAD BEEN CARELESSLY FIXED UPON IT THE MOMENT BEFORE--AND JUST BEHELD THE SKIRTS OF A MAN'S COAT VANISHING BEHIND A LARGE HOLLY-BUSH THAT STOOD BETWEEN THE WINDOW AND THE PORCH
THEY CAN'T HEAR YOU
I CAME TO OFFER YOU THAT COMFORT AND ASSISTANCE YOUR SITUATION REQUIRED
AND IF I DEVOTE MY TALENTS TO THE CULTIVATION OF MY FARM AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN GENERAL I SHALL THEREBY BENEFIT NOT ONLY MY OWN IMMEDIATE CONNECTIONS AND DEPENDANTS BUT IN SOME DEGREE MANKIND AT LARGE:--HENCE I SHALL NOT HAVE LIVED IN VAIN WITH SUCH REFLECTIONS AS THESE I WAS ENDEAVOURING TO CONSOLE MYSELF AS I PLODDED HOME FROM THE FIELDS ONE COLD DAMP CLOUDY EVENING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF OCTOBER
A GIG THEN--A FLY--CAR--ANYTHING--ONLY BE QUICK THERE WAS A GIG BUT NOT A HORSE TO SPARE
HER CHRISTIANITY THOUGH SAD AND TIMID WAS OF A KIND WHICH THOSE AROUND HER COULD UNDERSTAND
MR MILLWARD WAS QUITE BLESS THE BOY
AT SUCH A TIME AND PLACE I COULD NOT TRUST MYSELF TO ANSWER
THE FIRST INSTANCE HE GAVE WAS ON THE OCCASION OF OUR BRIDAL TOUR
WHEN I AM READY AND HOW I CAN MANAGE IT MOST EFFECTUALLY BUT YOUR CHILD MY CHILD GOES WITH ME HE WILL NOT ALLOW IT I SHALL NOT ASK HIM AH THEN IT IS A SECRET FLIGHT YOU MEDITATE
BUT LISTEN SAID SHE SMILINGLY PUTTING UP HER FINGER TO CHECK MY IMPATIENT REPLY
MR HARGRAVE WILL YOU PLEASE TO STEP THIS WAY SAID I
AND THIS PRACTICE I INTEND TO CONTINUE FOR SOME TIME TO COME
IF I HAVE SPOKEN TOO WARMLY FORGIVE ME HE MURMURED ON TAKING HIS LEAVE OR I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF ESTHER SMILED AND GLANCED AT ME
BUT SHE SHOWED IT BY A KIND OF GENTLE MELANCHOLY A MILD REPROACHFUL SADNESS THAT CUT ME TO THE HEART
THE LITTLE PREFACE IS A CURIOUS DOCUMENT
ARE YOU CROSS STILL HELEN SAID HE APPROACHING AS IF TO SALUTE ME
HER FACE WAS TOWARDS ME AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN IT WHICH ONCE SEEN INVITED ME TO LOOK AGAIN
I'LL NOT TROUBLE TO SEE HER UNLESS SHE COMES TO ME THEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO HUNTINGDON WHEN WE'RE GONE SAID RALPH HATTERSLEY
I CAN BEAR IT BETTER THAN YOU IMAGINE YES YOU WERE ALWAYS FOR BEARING BUT IF I WAS YOU I WOULDN'T BEAR IT
I SELDOM ATTEMPTED TO SEE HER ABOVE TWICE A WEEK
THESE ARE MRS WILSON AND HER DAUGHTER
I TORE OFF THE COVER AND DISCLOSED AN ELEGANT AND PORTABLE EDITION OF MARMION I GUESS I KNOW WHO THAT'S FOR SAID FERGUS WHO STOOD LOOKING ON WHILE I COMPLACENTLY EXAMINED THE VOLUME
I WAS MARRIED IN SUMMER ON A GLORIOUS AUGUST MORNING
WHY TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH IT'S VERY BAD INDEED--ISN'T IT HARGRAVE SAID HE ADDRESSING THAT GENTLEMAN WHO HAD ENTERED THE ROOM UNPERCEIVED BY ME FOR I WAS NOW STANDING NEAR THE FIRE WITH MY BACK TO THE DOOR
BUT THIS WAS ONLY MARCH
I BEGIN TO THINK THE WORLD IS NOT WORTHY OF YOU NOT UNDERSTANDING THIS SUDDEN EBULLITION HE TURNED UPON ME WITH A STARE OF GLOOMY BEWILDERED AMAZEMENT THAT MADE ME ASHAMED OF THE IMPULSE TO WHICH I HAD YIELDED
A SUPERANNUATED GREYHOUND GIVEN UP TO IDLENESS AND GOOD LIVING LAY BASKING BEFORE IT ON THE THICK SOFT RUG ON ONE CORNER OF WHICH BESIDE THE SOFA SAT A SMART YOUNG SPRINGER LOOKING WISTFULLY UP IN ITS MASTER'S FACE--PERHAPS ASKING PERMISSION TO SHARE HIS COUCH OR IT MIGHT BE ONLY SOLICITING A CARESS FROM HIS HAND OR A KIND WORD FROM HIS LIPS
AND SO I PLUNGED INTO IT AT ONCE AND FLOUNDERED THROUGH IT AS I COULD
THAT HE WAS NEITHER THE CONQUEROR NOR THE VILLAIN THAT HE MADE HIS SISTERS BELIEVE ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT HAS BEEN GATHERED SINCE MRS GASKELL WROTE GOES TO SHOW
IS THAT YOU MARKHAM SAID HE STARTLED AND CONFOUNDED AT THE APPARITION--PERHAPS TOO AT THE WILDNESS OF MY LOOKS
HE THEN RANG THE BELL
HENCEFORTH HOWEVER SHE WILL DOUBTLESS BE SOMEWHAT LESS TIMID AND RESERVED AND HE MORE KIND AND THOUGHTFUL.--SURELY THEN HER HOPES ARE NOT UNFOUNDED
AND SO SAID HE AT LENGTH YOU THOUGHT TO DISGRACE ME DID YOU BY RUNNING AWAY AND TURNING ARTIST AND SUPPORTING YOURSELF BY THE LABOUR OF YOUR HANDS FORSOOTH
FOR THE FIRST MILE OR TWO WE KEPT SILENCE I LOOKING OUT OF MY WINDOW AND SHE LEANING BACK IN HER CORNER
YOU SHALL NOT HEAR IT FROM ME
HIS COUNTENANCE FELL AS HE MET MY STEADY GAZE AND HE TURNED AWAY IN VERY OBVIOUS DISAPPOINTMENT AND WALKED UP TO THE FIRE-PLACE WHERE HE STOOD IN AN ATTITUDE OF UNDISGUISED DEJECTION LEANING AGAINST THE CHIMNEY-PIECE WITH HIS FOREHEAD SUNK UPON HIS ARM
BUT SHE KEPT HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM AS IF TO HIDE SOME UNCONTROLLABLE EMOTION
IT'S ONLY MY WAY OF TALKING
COME MY LAD SAID HE
THIS WOMAN WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME WITH HER KEEN FEELINGS AND HER INTERESTING FORCE OF CHARACTER
BUT YOU MUST HAVE SOME COMMISERATION FOR US HELEN
AND FOR THE REST IF ON HIS FATHER'S RETURN I FIND REASON TO APPREHEND THAT MY GOOD LESSONS WILL BE ALL DESTROYED--IF MR HUNTINGDON COMMENCE AGAIN THE GAME OF TEACHING THE CHILD TO HATE AND DESPISE HIS MOTHER AND EMULATE HIS FATHER'S WICKEDNESS--I WILL YET DELIVER MY SON FROM HIS HANDS
BUT HE LAUGHING AT HER OBJECTIONS TOLD HER IT WAS NO USE TALKING FOR THE MISCHIEF WAS ALREADY DONE
HE WILL KNOW THAT I SHOULD WISH BUT LITTLE TO BE SAID ON THE SUBJECT
AND THE UNGENTLE PLAY-FELLOW TOSSED IT INTO ITS MOTHER'S LAP BIDDING HER MAKE ALL STRAIGHT AS HAPPY TO RETURN TO THAT GENTLE COMFORTER AS IT HAD BEEN TO LEAVE HER THE CHILD NESTLED IN HER ARMS AND HUSHED ITS CRIES IN A MOMENT
SHE WOULD THINK ME COOLED AND CHANGED FOR NOT RETURNING IT OR PERHAPS HE HAD ALREADY GIVEN HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT I HAD CEASED TO THINK OF HER
NO THEY ARE MISS HARGRAVE'S OH
BUT I INTERNALLY ANSWERED,--'NO LAWRENCE YOU'RE WRONG THERE
AND WHEN I PUT MY HAND TO MY HEAD AND FOUND MY SKULL NOT BROKEN I THOUGHT IT WAS A MIRACLE AND NO MISTAKE
NO YOU WILL THINK IT NO COMPLIMENT WHEN I TELL YOU I WOULD RATHER HAVE HIM TO RESEMBLE BENSON THAN HIS FATHER HE SLIGHTLY ELEVATED HIS EYEBROWS BUT SAID NOTHING
READY TO LAUGH AND TO JEST WITH ANYTHING OR ANYBODY BUT ME AND I AM PARTICULARLY SILENT AND SAD
YOU MAY CALL THIS RELIGION BUT I CALL IT WILD FANATICISM THERE IS ANOTHER LIFE BOTH FOR YOU AND FOR ME SAID I
AND WHEN WE GO TO THE GROVE I ALWAYS CONTRIVE TO SEE HER AND TALK MORE TO HER THAN TO ANY ONE ELSE FOR I AM VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY LITTLE FRIEND AND SO IS SHE TO ME
I HAD AN INFERNAL PAIN HERE--IT IS QUITE GONE NOW
ARE YOU QUITE SURE
AND LISTEN TO ME
AND THEN I AM ROUSED TO DEFEND MYSELF SOMETIMES WITH BITTER RECRIMINATION
IT WAS SIMPLY THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE
WELL MR MARKHAM WHAT IS IT SAID THE YOUNG MOTHER ACCOSTING ME WITH A PLEASANT SMILE
THE POOR MAN TURNED PALE AND VISIBLY TREMBLED AS HE STOOPED TO PICK UP THE FRAGMENTS
I COULD SEE THAT WHILE SHE CARRIED HER HEAD ERECT HER EYES WERE BENT UPON THE GROUND AND HER FACE AND NECK WERE SUFFUSED WITH A CRIMSON BLUSH
WHAT MUST I SAY ABOUT IT
IN HIS DESPERATE EAGERNESS HE SEIZED THE BOTTLE AND SUCKED AWAY TILL HE SUDDENLY DROPPED FROM HIS CHAIR DISAPPEARING UNDER THE TABLE AMID A TEMPEST OF APPLAUSE
HE NEVER WENT ANYWHERE WITHOUT SUCH A COMPANION WHEREWITH TO IMPROVE HIS LEISURE MOMENTS
AND IT WAS WELL THEY DID FOR I WAS NOT FIT COMPANY FOR THEM NOR THEY FOR ME UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES
IT WAS NOW NEAR EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING FOR MY CANDLE HAD EXPIRED IN THE MIDST OF MY PERUSAL LEAVING ME NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO GET ANOTHER AT THE EXPENSE OF ALARMING THE HOUSE OR TO GO TO BED AND WAIT THE RETURN OF DAYLIGHT
WE HAD NOT FAR TO GO
BUT THEN YOU KNOW THERE MUST BE SOME FOUNDATION THE FOUNDATION IS IN THE WICKEDNESS AND FALSEHOOD OF THE WORLD SAID I AND IN THE FACT THAT MR LAWRENCE HAS BEEN SEEN TO GO THAT WAY ONCE OR TWICE OF AN EVENING--AND THE VILLAGE GOSSIPS SAY HE GOES TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE STRANGE LADY AND THE SCANDAL-MONGERS HAVE GREEDILY SEIZED THE RUMOUR TO MAKE IT THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN INFERNAL STRUCTURE WELL BUT GILBERT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN HER MANNER TO COUNTENANCE SUCH REPORTS DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN HER MANNER NO CERTAINLY
IT APPEARED AS IF THE WHOLE EVENING WAS FATED TO BE INSUPPORTABLE
THE ROMANCE OF OUR ATTACHMENT MUST BE WORN AWAY
BUT THAT WAS NO MATTER
BUT THEN THERE IS ONE FACE I AM ALWAYS TRYING TO PAINT OR TO SKETCH AND ALWAYS WITHOUT SUCCESS
WHAT SHOULD I DO THERE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW INDEED I CANNOT TELL
BUT I TOLD HIM I COULD NOT WITHOUT HIS MOTHER'S LEAVE
AND YOU ESPECIALLY REQUIRE ONE IN THIS COLD HOUSE AND DREARY ROOM YOU SHOULD HAVE COME A LITTLE SOONER AND I WOULD HAVE HAD ONE LIGHTED FOR YOU
THEN THAT WAS ANOTHER CRIME AND HER SOLEMN PROMISE TO LOVE AND HONOUR HIM WAS ANOTHER THAT ONLY INCREASED THE ENORMITY OF THE LAST YOU ARE TOO SEVERE UPON THE POOR LADY LAUGHED HE
I WAS ONLY GOING TO ASK IF YOU HAD PAINTED IT YOURSELF SAID I SULKILY RESIGNING THE PICTURE INTO HER HANDS
HAD SHE NOT DECEIVED ME INJURED ME--BLIGHTED MY HAPPINESS FOR LIFE
FOR THE MOMENT IT STOPPED HE SPRANG OUT OVER THE SIDE ON TO THE PORTICO STEPS AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE HOUSE
BESIDES THE KITCHEN THERE WERE TWO BEDROOMS A GOOD-SIZED PARLOUR AND ANOTHER SMALLER ONE WHICH I DESTINED FOR MY STUDIO ALL WELL AIRED AND SEEMINGLY IN GOOD REPAIR BUT ONLY PARTLY FURNISHED WITH A FEW OLD ARTICLES CHIEFLY OF PONDEROUS BLACK OAK THE VERITABLE ONES THAT HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE AND WHICH HAD BEEN KEPT AS ANTIQUARIAN RELICS IN MY BROTHER'S PRESENT RESIDENCE AND NOW IN ALL HASTE TRANSPORTED BACK AGAIN
WILL YOU LET ME TAKE OUR CHILD AND WHAT REMAINS OF MY FORTUNE AND GO GO WHERE ANYWHERE WHERE HE WILL BE SAFE FROM YOUR CONTAMINATING INFLUENCE AND I SHALL BE DELIVERED FROM YOUR PRESENCE AND YOU FROM MINE NO WILL YOU LET ME HAVE THE CHILD THEN WITHOUT THE MONEY NO NOR YOURSELF WITHOUT THE CHILD
IT'S HIGHLY IM OH I'M SURE IT ISN'T
AND SHAME AND DEEP REMORSE FOR MY OWN CONDUCT
IF HE OBSERVES HER ARTFUL BY-PLAY IT GIVES HIM NO UNEASINESS BUT RATHER ADDS NEW ZEST TO HIS DIVERSION BY OPPOSING A STIMULATING CHECK TO HIS OTHERWISE TOO EASY CONQUEST
HE SHOOK HANDS WITH HER AND WISHED HER GOOD-MORNING
AND THEN IN GRATITUDE I'LL HEAR WHATEVER YOU LIKE TO SAY I ACCORDINGLY DROPPED THE UNWELCOME TOPIC
THEY ONLY GAPED AND STARED
MR BOARHAM IS IN NO PARTICULAR HURRY FOR HE HAS LITTLE DOUBT OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE
AND WHEN HE IS ABSENT TO ATTEND TO HIS INTERESTS DOMESTIC OR OTHERWISE AND PATIENTLY WAIT HIS RETURN NO MATTER HOW HE MAY BE OCCUPIED IN THE MEANTIME
NOT I THINK FROM ANY LURKING TENDERNESS FOR THE MEMORY OF PAST AFFECTION NOR YET TO REMIND ME OF MY FORMER FOLLY BUT CHIEFLY THAT I MAY COMPARE MY SON'S FEATURES AND COUNTENANCE WITH THIS AS HE GROWS UP AND THUS BE ENABLED TO JUDGE HOW MUCH OR HOW LITTLE HE RESEMBLES HIS FATHER--IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO KEEP HIM WITH ME STILL AND NEVER TO BEHOLD THAT FATHER'S FACE AGAIN--A BLESSING I HARDLY DARE RECKON UPON
I IMMEDIATELY RELEASED THE SQUIRE
AND BESIDES THE COMPANIONSHIP OF MY CHILD AND MY DEAR FAITHFUL RACHEL WHO EVIDENTLY GUESSED MY SORROWS AND FELT FOR THEM THOUGH SHE WAS TOO DISCREET TO ALLUDE TO THEM I HAD MY BOOKS AND PENCIL MY DOMESTIC AFFAIRS AND THE WELFARE AND COMFORT OF ARTHUR'S POOR TENANTS AND LABOURERS TO ATTEND TO
BUT FOR YOU I MIGHT SINK INTO THE GROSSEST CONDITION OF SELF-INDULGENCE AND CARELESSNESS ABOUT THE WANTS OF OTHERS FROM THE MERE HABIT OF BEING CONSTANTLY CARED FOR MYSELF AND HAVING ALL MY WANTS ANTICIPATED OR IMMEDIATELY SUPPLIED WHILE LEFT IN TOTAL IGNORANCE OF WHAT IS DONE FOR ME,--IF ROSE DID NOT ENLIGHTEN ME NOW AND THEN
I ALWAYS AVOID HER COMPANY AS MUCH AS I CAN WITHOUT VIOLATING THE LAWS OF HOSPITALITY
NO WHAT WAS HE SAYING THEN
MY DRAWING SUITS ME BEST FOR I CAN DRAW AND THINK AT THE SAME TIME
I SAW TOO OR RATHER I FELT THAT IN SPITE OF HERSELF I WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO HER AS THE NOVEL HEROES MODESTLY EXPRESS IT AND WHILE I THANKFULLY ENJOYED MY PRESENT GOOD FORTUNE I COULD NOT FAIL TO WISH AND HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER IN FUTURE
AND THE LONGER I HAVE TO WAIT THE GREATER WILL BE MY DREAD THAT SOMETHING WILL INTERVENE TO SNATCH YOU FROM ME--AND THINK A THOUSAND THINGS MAY HAPPEN IN A YEAR!--I SHALL BE IN ONE LONG FEVER OF RESTLESS TERROR AND IMPATIENCE ALL THE TIME
OH I WOULD TAKE MY PRECIOUS CHARGE AT EARLY DAWN TAKE THE COACH TO M FLEE TO THE PORT OF CROSS THE ATLANTIC AND SEEK A QUIET HUMBLE HOME IN NEW ENGLAND WHERE I WOULD SUPPORT MYSELF AND HIM BY THE LABOUR OF MY HANDS
TO THINK OF HIM ENGAGED IN ACTIVE SPORTS AMONG THE WILD HILLS OF SCOTLAND WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM KNOWING HIM TO BE IMMERSED AMID THE CORRUPTIONS AND TEMPTATIONS OF LONDON
I WANT THE EXERCISE OF A RUN TO THE TOP OF THE HOUSE
I DON'T THANK HER FOR THIS
WHERE'S THE USE OF A PROBATIONARY EXISTENCE IF A MAN MAY SPEND IT AS HE PLEASES JUST CONTRARY TO GOD'S DECREES AND THEN GO TO HEAVEN WITH THE BEST--IF THE VILEST SINNER MAY WIN THE REWARD OF THE HOLIEST SAINT BY MERELY SAYING I REPENT BUT IF YOU SINCERELY REPENT I CAN'T REPENT
IS THAT YOU I MUSTERED THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO REPLY
THIS IS BY OPENLY BUT NOT TOO GLARINGLY COQUETTING WITH MR HUNTINGDON WHO IS QUITE WILLING TO BE HER PARTNER IN THE GAME
BUT I MECHANICALLY LOOKED UP AND SAW MR HARGRAVE STANDING BESIDE ME ON THE RUG
I AM NOT ABOUT TO OFFEND YOU WITH ANY USELESS ENTREATIES OR COMPLAINTS
SIT DOWN A LITTLE AND COMPOSE YOURSELF
WILL YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN MISS WILSON SAID I
BUT I TRUST THESE TRIALS ARE OVER NOW
MY LIFE IS A DESOLATE BLANK
ENJOYING THE HEAVENLY BEAUTY OF THE FLOWERS THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF HIS SMILING EYES
BUT NOBODY SPOKE TO HIM AND HE SPOKE TO NOBODY
AND TELL HER--NO NOTHING MORE
I WONDER YOU CAN EXPECT IT BUT I SNATCHED UP A CANDLE AND BROUGHT IT TO HIM
AND WE WILL LIVE EITHER HERE OR ELSEWHERE AS YOU AND SHE MAY DETERMINE AND YOU SHALL SEE HER AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE
BUT GRIMSBY HAD MUCH SKILL AND LITTLE SCRUPLE AND WHETHER HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OTHER'S TREMBLING BLINDED EAGERNESS TO DEAL UNFAIRLY BY HIM I CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO SAY
FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T YOU ATTEMPT THESE ARGUMENTS
IT IS WELL THAT SHE IS LEAVING TO-MORROW FOR I COULD NOT WELL ENDURE HER PRESENCE FOR ANOTHER DAY
HE RODE UP TO HER AND ASKED TO SEE THE CHILD
I WISH I COULD RENDER THE INCENTIVES TO EVERY OTHER EQUALLY INNOXIOUS IN HIS CASE BUT BY SUCH MEANS SAID I YOU WILL NEVER RENDER HIM VIRTUOUS.--WHAT IS IT THAT CONSTITUTES VIRTUE MRS GRAHAM
I WOULD BEG MY UNCLE AND AUNT OR MY BROTHER TO COME AND SEE ME BUT I DO NOT LIKE TO COMPLAIN OF MY LONELINESS TO THEM AND INDEED LONELINESS IS THE LEAST OF MY SUFFERINGS
ONLY I DID NOT WANT TO DISTURB THE CAT MARY DEAR THAT WON'T EXCUSE YOU IN MR MARKHAM'S EYES SAID ELIZA
AND SO GOOD-NIGHT SHE TURNED FROM ME TO HIDE THE EMOTION SHE COULD NOT QUITE CONTROL
AND IF HIS GREATEST PLEASURE OF ALL IS NOT THE ENJOYMENT OF MY COMPANY WHY IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR HIM THAT'S ALL IF SUCH ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF MATRIMONY ESTHER YOU MUST INDEED BE CAREFUL WHOM YOU MARRY--OR RATHER YOU MUST AVOID IT ALTOGETHER CHAPTER XLII SEPTEMBER 1ST.--NO MR HUNTINGDON YET
WHAT SHALL I DO WITHOUT HIM I REPEAT
THE REST WAS TORN AWAY
WHY MARKHAM ASKED MY COMPANION WITH AN AIR OF INNOCENT SURPRISE
AND THAT REMINDS ME THAT I HAVE HAD SEVERAL LETTERS FROM MILICENT SINCE HER MARRIAGE AND THAT SHE EITHER IS OR PRETENDS TO BE QUITE RECONCILED TO HER LOT
IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO GRANT IT I ADDED HASTILY NOT LIKING THE ASPECT OF HIS FACE IT'S NO MATTER
ABOUT TWO MINUTES AFTER HOWEVER SHE DECLARED HER SKETCH COMPLETED AND CLOSED THE BOOK
COME SPEAK UP CHILD I CAN'T TELL NOW SOBBED SHE
WHAT GENTLEMEN I ASKED WHEN I HEARD IT
AFTER A FEW PASSING OBSERVATIONS UPON INDIFFERENT SUBJECTS HE BEGAN IN SOLEMN TONES THE FOLLOWING APPEAL TO MY HUMANITY IT WILL BE FOUR YEARS NEXT APRIL SINCE I FIRST SAW YOU MRS HUNTINGDON--YOU MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT I NEVER CAN
MR HUNTINGDON THOSE ARE MY UNFINISHED SKETCHES CRIED I AND I NEVER LET ANY ONE SEE THEM AND I PLACED MY HAND ON THE PORTFOLIO TO WREST IT FROM HIM BUT HE MAINTAINED HIS HOLD ASSURING ME THAT HE LIKED UNFINISHED SKETCHES OF ALL THINGS BUT I HATE THEM TO BE SEEN RETURNED I
AND THEN YOU'VE YOUR FAMILY ESTATE YET
WE'LL ALL GO TOGETHER AND YOU SHALL SEE HOW THE NEW LIFE SUITS YOU BLESS YOU HONEY CRIED SHE AFFECTIONATELY RETURNING MY EMBRACE
DO YOU THINK I'LL BEAR ALL THE BURDEN OF MY SINS ON MY OWN SHOULDERS AS LONG AS THERE'S ANOTHER READY TO HELP ME WITH NONE OF HER OWN TO CARRY THERE IS NO SUCH ONE ON EARTH SAID SHE SERIOUSLY
I DO SOMETIMES REPLIED SHE
WE SHALL RETURN HOME SHORTLY AND THEN SHE ADDED WITH SOLEMN SIGNIFICANCE I HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO YOU SO I WENT HOME PREPARED FOR A FORMIDABLE LECTURE
TO ASK YOU CONTINUED SHE TO GET ME A ROSE FOR MRS HUNTINGDON HE DEPARTED
BUT I DID NOT WISH TO UPBRAID YOU,--THOUGH AS YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED YOU HAD DEEPLY WRONGED ME
NOT TO LOOK AFTER THE FARM THOUGH THAT WOULD SERVE AS MY EXCUSE BUT TO COOL MY BRAIN AND REGAIN IF POSSIBLE A SUFFICIENT DEGREE OF COMPOSURE TO MEET THE FAMILY AT THE MORNING MEAL WITHOUT EXCITING INCONVENIENT REMARKS
CHAPTER VIII SIX WEEKS HAD PASSED AWAY
FOR SHE SEEMED BENT UPON ENGROSSING HIS ATTENTION TO HERSELF AND HE SEEMED NOTHING LOTH TO PAY THE HOMAGE SHE DEMANDED
HE HAD A SON AND A NOMINAL DAUGHTER IT IS TRUE BUT THEY TOO PAINFULLY REMINDED HIM OF THEIR MOTHER AND THE UNFORTUNATE LITTLE ANNABELLA WAS A SOURCE OF PERPETUAL BITTERNESS TO HIS SOUL
IT IS ANNABELLA WILMOT YOU HATE NOT ME I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ANNABELLA WILMOT SAID I BURNING WITH INDIGNATION
OH YES HE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
IN THIS HOUSE AMONG THOSE PEOPLE--OH HOW COULD I ENDURE TO LIVE
HE'S SURE TO GIVE HIS CONSENT
AND THE TEARS GUSHED FROM HIS EYES AS HE EARNESTLY EXCLAIMED OH HELEN IF I HAD LISTENED TO YOU IT NEVER WOULD HAVE COME TO THIS
NOW SHUT THE DOOR AND COME TO THE FIRE WHILE ROSE GETS THE TEA READY
WHEN I WAS TIRED OF LEANING FORWARD WITH THE COLD RAW WIND IN MY FACE AND SURVEYING THE RUSSET HEDGES AND THE DAMP TANGLED GRASS OF THEIR BANKS I GAVE IT UP AND LEANT BACK TOO
WHERE HER OPINIONS AND SENTIMENTS TALLIED WITH MINE IT WAS HER EXTREME GOOD SENSE HER EXQUISITE TASTE AND FEELING THAT DELIGHTED ME
DO YOU NEVER MEAN TO COME TO WOODFORD AGAIN I CALLED ONCE AND YOU WERE OUT I WAS SORRY BUT THAT WAS LONG SINCE
DOUBTLESS THERE WAS A WIDE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE RANK AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF MRS HUNTINGDON THE LADY OF GRASSDALE MANOR AND THOSE OF MRS GRAHAM THE ARTIST THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL
I HAVE NO CAUSE TO FEAR
AND I ROSE EARLY TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT--I HAVE BEEN HERE ALONE THIS HALF-HOUR AND YOU--YOU LAZY CREATURE WELL I THOUGHT I WAS EARLY TOO SAID HE
AND DURING MY ABSENCE YOU MAY PAY A VISIT TO STANINGLEY IF YOU LIKE
NO I TELL YOU I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT IF I HADN'T BEEN UNDER EXCITEMENT
A LONG VEIL SHROUDED HALF HER GRACEFUL FORM BUT DID NOT HIDE IT
SO GOOD-EVENING WITH THAT I LEFT HER SMOTHERING HER MALICIOUS LAUGHTER AND TURNED ASIDE INTO THE FIELDS SPRINGING UP THE BANK AND PUSHING THROUGH THE NEAREST GAP IN THE HEDGE
NEITHER WAS IT TO GRATIFY MY OWN TASTE NOR YET TO INGRATIATE MYSELF WITH THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC
I WON'T KEEP YOU A MINUTE I ACCOMPANIED HER THROUGH THE GAP
MY BLISS IS SOBERED BUT NOT DESTROYED
I WANTED TO ASK YOU GOOD-MORNING ESTHER SAID I TAKING HER HAND AND GIVING IT A SEVERE SQUEEZE
MR HATTERSLEY SPENDS MUCH OF HIS TIME AT ARTHUR'S BED-SIDE
PERHAPS HE WOULD DISAPPROVE OF MY ATTACHMENT NOW AS HIGHLY AS BEFORE
AND SHE STAYED WITH ME TILL IT WAS TIME TO GO DOWN
IS HE DYING THEN I THINK NOT MARKHAM AND HOW MANY MORE NURSES HAS HE
THE FARM WAS ABANDONED TO THE LABOURERS AND THE LABOURERS WERE LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES
GILBERT I MUST SPEAK WITH YOU SAID SHE IN A TONE OF SUPPRESSED VEHEMENCE
THE CLOSE GREEN WALLS OF PRIVET THAT HAD BORDERED THE PRINCIPAL WALK WERE TWO-THIRDS WITHERED AWAY AND THE REST GROWN BEYOND ALL REASONABLE BOUNDS
PERHAPS HOWEVER HE SPARED A MOMENT TO EXCHANGE A WORD OR A GLANCE WITH HIS COMPANION NOW AND THEN--AT ANY RATE SHE DID NOT APPEAR AT ALL RESENTFUL OF HIS CONDUCT
I AM THWARTING HER WISHES WRONGING MY BROTHER AND MAKING MYSELF A BURDEN ON HER HANDS
BUT I MUST CONFESS I SHALL REJOICE TO BID ADIEU TO THE REST INHOSPITABLE AS IT MAY APPEAR NO ONE CAN BLAME YOU FOR SUCH AN AVOWAL REPLIED HE GRAVELY
BUT THERE WAS ONE PRESENT WHO SEEMED TO HAVE A BETTER APPRECIATION OF MY FRAME OF MIND
I ATTENDED CAREFULLY TO HIS WANTS AND AMUSEMENTS BUT NOT I OWN WITH THE SAME DEVOTED FONDNESS AS BEFORE BECAUSE I COULD NOT FEEL IT
BUT IN FUTURE MR HATTERSLEY WHEN YOU SEE HER LOOKING FLAT OR CRYING FOR NOTHING AS YOU CALL IT ASCRIBE IT ALL TO YOURSELF
YOUR ACTIONS ARE ALL RIGHT SO FAR
WELL!--IF IT HAD BEEN ME NOW I SHOULD HAVE HAD NO TEA AT ALL--IF IT HAD BEEN FERGUS EVEN HE WOULD HAVE TO PUT UP WITH SUCH AS THERE WAS AND BEEN TOLD TO BE THANKFUL FOR IT WAS FAR TOO GOOD FOR HIM
BUT YOU HAVE NO COMPASSION FOR ME WHEN MY HEAD IS SPLIT IN TWO AND ALL ON FIRE WITH THIS CONSUMING FEVER HE LEANT HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND AND SIGHED
AND SWEETNESS AND GOODNESS ENOUGH HE CONTINUED TO MAKE HOME TOLERABLE AND TO RECONCILE ME TO MYSELF I THINK I SHOULD DO YET
FOR THEIR HOSPITABLE ENTERTAINER WAS LOTH TO PART WITH THEM AND BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS BRIGHT INTELLECT HIS STAINLESS CONSCIENCE AND HIS LOVED AND LOVING WIFE
THE OTHER WAS SEATED BESIDE HER WITH A POCKET EDITION OF SOME CLASSIC AUTHOR IN HIS HAND
AND EVERY LUCKY HIT WAS LOOKED UPON AS THE DAWN OF BETTER TIMES TILL EXPERIENCE PROVED THE CONTRARY
NO ANSWERING SPARK OF KINDNESS NO AWAKENING PENITENCE BUT AN UNAPPEASABLE ILL-HUMOUR AND A SPIRIT OF TYRANNOUS EXACTION THAT INCREASED WITH INDULGENCE AND A LURKING GLEAM OF SELF-COMPLACENT TRIUMPH AT EVERY DETECTION OF RELENTING SOFTNESS IN MY MANNER THAT CONGEALED ME TO MARBLE AGAIN AS OFTEN AS IT RECURRED
I WOULD HAVE PICKED IT UP MYSELF
NIGHT.--WHAT HAVE I DONE
EMILY'S LINES ARE FULL OF FAULTS BUT THEY HAVE THE INDEFINABLE QUALITY--HERE NO DOUBT ONLY IN THE BUD ONLY AS A MATTER OF PROMISE--WHICH ANNE'S ARE ENTIRELY WITHOUT
I WISH--I DO INTENSELY WISH HE WOULD RETURN
INDEED YOU SHOULDN'T DO SUCH THINGS
BUT I CAN'T DO WITH YOU HELEN WAS HIS ANSWER
ABSENT HE WAS BUT EXPECTED HOME IN A FEW MINUTES
A PROFESSIONAL NURSE A GRIM HARD OLD WOMAN HAD BEEN HIRED TO ATTEND THE WRETCHED INVALID
I HAD IT FROM A VERY AUTHENTIC SOURCE FROM WHOM MAY I ASK FROM ONE OF THE SERVANTS AT WOODFORD OH
HAVE YOU INDEED
AND BY MR BOARHAM'S THAT HE WAS NOT AN AGREEABLE COMPANION
AND I DON'T ENVY HIM HIS BARGAIN
BUT WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK AND EVERY TIME I INQUIRED ABOUT HER SHE WAS STILL AT STANINGLEY
THERE GOES THE DINNER-BELL AND HERE COMES MY AUNT TO SCOLD ME FOR SITTING HERE AT MY DESK ALL DAY INSTEAD OF STAYING WITH THE COMPANY
HE WAS RIDING BY MY SIDE AS USUAL AND ANNABELLA AND LORD LOWBOROUGH WERE A LITTLE BEFORE US THE LATTER BENDING TOWARDS HIS COMPANION AS IF IN TENDER AND CONFIDENTIAL DISCOURSE
BUT IMMEDIATELY I WAS SENSIBLE OF HAVING COMMITTED AN ACT OF IMPERTINENCE IN SO DOING
ROSE WAS DELIGHTED
NOR CAN I CONCEIVE HOW ANY ONE CAN WELL I DON'T KNOW
FOR HE HAS BUSINESS AT L THAT WAS OUR MARKET-TOWN AND WILL REQUIRE A LITTLE REFRESHMENT BEFORE HE GOES I SUBMITTED ACCORDINGLY WITH THE BEST GRACE I COULD
AND MY MOTHER WAS THE SOUL OF ORDER AND PUNCTUALITY
WHILE HEAVEN SPARES MY REASON REPLIED I SNATCHING AWAY THE HAND HE HAD PRESUMED TO SEIZE AND PRESS BETWEEN HIS OWN
I TRIED IN VAIN TO DIVERT HIS MIND FROM THE SUBJECT
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING NOW WE'RE ABOUT IT WHICH YOU MAY BELIEVE OR NOT AS YOU CHOOSE--ONLY PLEASE TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS NOT MY CUSTOM TO SPEAK FALSELY AND THAT IN THIS CASE I CAN HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR MISREPRESENTING THE TRUTH WELL MARKHAM WHAT NOW MISS WILSON HATES YOUR SISTER
NO MAMMA SAID THE CHILD
BUT AND DID YOU NOT SAY THAT YOUR AFFECTION MUST BE FOUNDED ON APPROBATION
HOWEVER I THOUGHT IT BUT REASONABLE TO MAKE SOME SLIGHT EXERTION TO RENDER MY COMPANY AGREEABLE
I WISH THIS DAY WERE OVER
OH IT WOULD BE CRUEL TO MAKE HER FEEL AS I FEEL NOW AND KNOW WHAT I HAVE KNOWN
AND HE ASTONISHED US ALL NOT ONLY BY HIS GENERAL CHEERFULNESS AND ANIMATION BUT BY THE POSITIVE FLASHES OF TRUE FORCE AND BRILLIANCE HE EMITTED FROM TIME TO TIME
NEVER MIND THE PIECES NOW BENSON
CHAPTER IV OUR PARTY ON THE 5TH OF NOVEMBER PASSED OFF VERY WELL IN SPITE OF MRS GRAHAM'S REFUSAL TO GRACE IT WITH HER PRESENCE
BUT AT PRESENT EACH HAS A MORE EXALTED OPINION OF THE OTHER THAN I FEAR HE OR SHE DESERVES
HE WAS NOT SO MUCH USED TO IT THEN BUT AFTER THAT HE TOOK TO IT KINDLY TO SOLACE HIS CARES
THERE THEY GO SAID HE AS THE CARRIAGES FILED AWAY BEFORE US
BY-THE-BY WHERE'S LADY LOWBOROUGH IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM WHAT A SPLENDID CREATURE SHE IS CONTINUED HE FIXING HIS EYES ON HIS WIFE WHO CHANGED COLOUR AND LOOKED MORE AND MORE DISCONCERTED AS HE PROCEEDED
I WILL PUT NO LIMITS TO MY HOPES
IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I--YOUR RIVAL--READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR DEBTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE I SHALL NOT TELL HIM YOU WILL NOT CRIED SHE DELIGHTEDLY
AND WALK IN THE WAYS OF THINE HEART AND IN THE SIGHT OF THINE EYES
KNEELING BESIDE HIM I TOOK HIS HAND AND FONDLY PRESSED IT TO MY LIPS--FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE OUR SEPARATION--AND TOLD HIM AS WELL AS TEARS WOULD LET ME SPEAK THAT IT WAS NOT THAT THAT KEPT ME SILENT
HE WAS STILL LAUGHING WHEN MR HARGRAVE MADE HIS APPEARANCE
IT IS DEPLORABLE TO SEE HOW COMPLETELY HIS PAST LIFE HAS DEGENERATED HIS ONCE NOBLE CONSTITUTION AND VITIATED THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF HIS ORGANIZATION
OFTEN HE DWELT WITH SHUDDERING MINUTENESS ON THE FATE OF HIS PERISHING CLAY--THE SLOW PIECEMEAL DISSOLUTION ALREADY INVADING HIS FRAME
BE QUICK IF YOU PLEASE I OFFENDED YOU THIS MORNING
VERY PRETTY I'FAITH SAID HE AFTER ATTENTIVELY REGARDING IT FOR A FEW SECONDS
I'LL LEAVE YOU THEN SAID I
THE LITTLE CREATURE RAISED ITS FACE AND CALLED ALOUD TO THE DOG
AND THERE SHE LIVES ALL ALONE--EXCEPT AN OLD WOMAN FOR A SERVANT OH DEAR
AND WITH A KIND OF SHAMELESS CALMNESS--SHOCKING INDEED TO WITNESS IN ONE SO YOUNG--AS GOOD AS TOLD ME THAT MY REMONSTRANCE WAS UNAVAILING AND MY PASTORAL ADVICE QUITE THROWN AWAY UPON HER--NAY THAT MY VERY PRESENCE WAS DISPLEASING WHILE I SPOKE SUCH THINGS
THE BLOOD RUSHED FIRST TO MY HEART AND THEN TO MY HEAD
AND IF SUCH AN OCCASION SHOULD NEVER PRESENT ITSELF COMFORT YOUR MIND WITH THIS REFLECTION THAT THOUGH IN SINGLE LIFE YOUR JOYS MAY NOT BE VERY MANY YOUR SORROWS AT LEAST WILL NOT BE MORE THAN YOU CAN BEAR
THEN SUDDENLY PAUSING AND TURNING TO MY COMPANION I IMPATIENTLY EXCLAIMED WHY DID SHE TAKE THIS INFATUATED STEP
BUT I COULD NOT HELP STEALING A GLANCE NOW AND THEN FROM THE SPLENDID VIEW AT OUR FEET TO THE ELEGANT WHITE HAND THAT HELD THE PENCIL AND THE GRACEFUL NECK AND GLOSSY RAVEN CURLS THAT DROOPED OVER THE PAPER
SHE KNOWS BETTER THAN TO VALUE WORLDLY WEALTH ABOVE ITS PRICE WHAT IS IT THEN SHE WISHES ME TO--TO MARRY NONE BUT A REALLY GOOD MAN WHAT A MAN OF DECIDED PIETY"?--AHEM!--WELL COME I'LL MANAGE THAT TOO
SHE IS A DAUGHTER OF EARTH
I COMMENCED MY CAREER--OR MY FIRST CAMPAIGN AS MY UNCLE CALLS IT--KINDLING WITH BRIGHT HOPES AND FANCIES--CHIEFLY RAISED BY THIS CONVERSATION--AND FULL OF CONFIDENCE IN MY OWN DISCRETION
I ENTERED IT AND BADE THE MAN WHO BROUGHT IT DRIVE TO GRASSDALE MANOR--I WAS TOO BUSY WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS TO CARE TO DRIVE IT MYSELF
SHE CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE ME TO TOWN FOR PLEASURE AND NONSENSE SHE SAYS AND IT IS NOT EVERY RICH GENTLEMAN THAT WILL CONSENT TO TAKE ME WITHOUT A FORTUNE WHATEVER EXALTED IDEAS I MAY HAVE OF MY OWN ATTRACTIONS WELL ESTHER I PITY YOU
I WONDER IF IT WILL
BUT OUR INTERCOURSE MUST END HERE END HERE ECHOED I
I AM NOW ENGAGED IN WRITING THE FOURTH VOLUME OF SOLALA VERNON'S LIFE SAYS ANNE AT TWENTY-ONE
SWEARING AND CURSING LIKE A MANIAC HATTERSLEY THREW HIMSELF ON TO THE OTTOMAN BESIDE THE WINDOW
SHE TURNED HER EYES ON ME AGAIN WITH A LOOK OF QUIET GRAVE SURPRISE THAT HAD THE EFFECT OF A REBUKE WHETHER INTENDED FOR SUCH OR NOT
HIS USUALLY PALE FACE WAS FLUSHED AND FEVERISH
I'D PAY HER HER WAGES AND SEND HER PACKING TO-MORROW BUT I KNOW SHE'D DO MORE MISCHIEF OUT OF THE HOUSE THAN IN IT AND AS I DEPARTED HE WENT ON CURSING AND ABUSING MY FAITHFUL FRIEND AND SERVANT WITH EPITHETS I WILL NOT DEFILE THIS PAPER WITH REPEATING
AND THEN IT WAS THAT IN CASUALLY DISCUSSING THE POETRY OF SIR WALTER SCOTT SHE HAD EXPRESSED A WISH TO SEE MARMION AND I HAD CONCEIVED THE PRESUMPTUOUS IDEA OF MAKING HER A PRESENT OF IT AND ON MY RETURN HOME INSTANTLY SENT FOR THE SMART LITTLE VOLUME I HAD THIS MORNING RECEIVED
FOR YOU ARE YOUNG GILBERT AND YOU OUGHT TO MARRY--AND WILL SOME TIME THOUGH YOU MAY THINK IT IMPOSSIBLE NOW
I'M ONLY COME TO BE WITH YOU AWHILE BECAUSE I CAN'T BEAR MY OWN THOUGHTS AND HE FOLDED HIS ARMS AND LEANT BACK IN HIS CHAIR
SO THEN THOUGHT I HE DESPISES ME BECAUSE HE KNOWS I LOVE HIM AND THE REFLECTION MADE ME SO MISERABLE I KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO
BUT FINDING NONE AT ALL I TURNED MY ARMS AGAINST THE HAWKS AND CARRION CROWS WHOSE DEPREDATIONS AS I SUSPECTED HAD DEPRIVED ME OF BETTER PREY
THE LATTER IS NOW ABOVE A YEAR OLD
AND SINCE YOU BID ME FORGIVE IT I WILL AND FORGET IT TOO I GUESS THE BEST RETURN I CAN MAKE WILL BE TO TAKE MYSELF OFF MUTTERED HATTERSLEY WITH A BROAD GRIN
AND ON TURNING MY HEAD I SAW IT WAS DRAINED TO THE BOTTOM
BUT WHEN I HAD LEFT THE HOUSE AND WAS PROCEEDING DOWN THE WALK SHE OPENED THE WINDOW AND CALLED ME BACK
MR HUNTINGDON CRIED I I INSIST UPON HAVING THAT BACK
YOU MUST TELL ME IF YOU CAN THAT MR HATTERSLEY IS BETTER THAN HE SEEMS--THAT HE IS UPRIGHT HONOURABLE AND OPEN-HEARTED--IN FACT A PERFECT DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH
CHECK CRIED HE
AND POSSIBLY HIS NURSE ALONE--AND UNPROTECTED
AND IF NOT IT IS MUCH BETTER THAT THE TRUTH SHOULD DAWN GRADUALLY UPON HIM
IT CONTAINED UPON EXAMINATION A NEWSPAPER AND ONE OR TWO LETTERS FOR HIM AND A COUPLE OF LETTERS FOR ME WHICH HE TOSSED ACROSS THE TABLE WITHOUT A REMARK
THIRDLY HIS TASTES AND FEELINGS ARE WHOLLY DISSIMILAR TO MINE
THEY ARE NO COMPANY FOR ANY BUT THEMSELVES THERE IS NO ONE HERE BUT MILICENT AND SHE OH I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO WATCH YOU CRIED OUR MUTUAL FRIEND
AS A FRIEND OF BOTH HE WOULD WISH US BOTH WELL
MRS GASKELL SAYS
OPIUM AND DRINK ARE THE SUFFICIENT EXPLANATIONS
INSTEAD OF ASSISTING ME TO BULLY THE SEVERAL COACHMEN AND URGE THEM FORWARD THEY MERELY STARED AND GRINNED AT MY IMPATIENCE
I LOOKED AT LORD LOWBOROUGH
HOWEVER THEY FELL TO WORK
I WAS THUNDERSTRUCK
MR HATTERSLEY YOU KNOW IS THE SON OF A RICH BANKER AND AS ESTHER AND I HAVE NO FORTUNES AND WALTER VERY LITTLE OUR DEAR MAMMA IS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE US ALL WELL MARRIED THAT IS UNITED TO RICH PARTNERS
FORMERLY SAID SHE TIMIDLY I COULD HAVE VENTURED TO ASK YOU WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT I COULD DO TO COMFORT YOU
WE HAVE NO GROUSE OR HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SIMILARLY OCCUPIED AT THIS MOMENT INSTEAD OF LYING UNDER THE ACACIA-TREE PULLING POOR DASH'S EARS
I SHA'N'T MIND IT
HAD ANY OF THE SERVANTS VEXED HER
HE HAD SUSPENDED THE UTTERANCE OF THAT LAST FATAL SYLLABLE THE BETTER TO ENJOY MY DISMAY
AT ALL EVENTS I COULD ILL ENDURE THAT PRESENT SUCCESS SHOULD ADD ONE TITTLE TO HIS CONSCIOUS POWER HIS INSOLENT SELF-CONFIDENCE I OUGHT TO SAY OR ENCOURAGE FOR A MOMENT HIS DREAM OF FUTURE CONQUEST
AND I WISH TO LEAVE A GOOD IMPRESSION ON YOU ALL,'--SHE GLANCED ROUND AND SEEING HER AUNT'S EYE FIXED UPON HER RATHER TOO SCRUTINIZINGLY AS SHE PROBABLY THOUGHT SHE STARTED UP AND CONTINUED
HE HAD RISEN FROM THE GROUND AND GRASPING HIS PONY'S MANE WAS ATTEMPTING TO RESUME HIS SEAT IN THE SADDLE
IF HE DID NOT I WOULD CASUALLY ASK HAVE YOU HEARD FROM YOUR SISTER LATELY IF HE SAID NO THE MATTER WAS DROPPED
I WOULD FAIN HAVE PUT IT OFF TILL THE MORROW
IF HE OVERSHOT THE MARK ONE NIGHT THE EFFECTS OF IT RENDERED HIM SO MISERABLE THE NEXT DAY THAT HE MUST REPEAT THE OFFENCE TO MEND IT
AND IN THE THIRD PLACE AS I INTIMATED BEFORE I WAS WEARIED OF THE THRONG AND BUSTLE THE RESTLESS HURRY AND CEASELESS CHANGE OF A LIFE SO ALIEN TO ALL MY PREVIOUS HABITS
AND I ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE MR HUNTINGDON TO THINK OF YOU TOO
AND NOW YOU MUST MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME BY REDOUBLED EXERTIONS
BUT I QUICKLY RE-CAPTURED THE PONY SCARCE LESS ASTONISHED THAN ITS MASTER AT SUCH UNCIVIL USAGE
NO NO SAID HE HASTILY SETTING HIMSELF BEFORE ME
SOME IDLE SLANDER SOMEBODY HAS BEEN INVENTING I SUPPOSE
I THOUGHT NOT HE MUTTERED AS IF TO HIMSELF LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY ON THE GROUND
THERE IS INTERNAL INJURY AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT THERE NOW
IF HE CONTINUE THIS PLAN I SHALL BE ABLE TO STAY AT GRASSDALE WELL ENOUGH--THAT IS I SHALL BE ABLE TO STAY AND THAT IS ENOUGH
MEANTIME I EARNESTLY WISH I COULD BANISH THE THOUGHTS OF THEM FROM YOUR MIND--AND MY OWN TOO FOR I HATE TO THINK OF THEM--YES--EVEN OF MY DEAR FRIEND HUNTINGDON WHEN I CONSIDER THE POWER HE POSSESSES OVER THE HAPPINESS OF ONE SO IMMEASURABLY SUPERIOR TO HIMSELF AND THE USE HE MAKES OF IT--I POSITIVELY DETEST THE MAN YOU HAD BETTER NOT SAY SO TO ME THEN SAID I
KEEP BOTH HEART AND HAND IN YOUR OWN POSSESSION TILL YOU SEE GOOD REASON TO PART WITH THEM
IT SOUNDED VERY LIKE CONFOUNDED SLUT BUT I WAS QUITE WILLING IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE
I'LL GO TO CHURCH MORNING AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND COMPORT MYSELF IN SUCH A GODLY SORT THAT SHE SHALL REGARD ME WITH ADMIRATION AND SISTERLY LOVE AS A BRAND PLUCKED FROM THE BURNING
I TRIED TO CHEER HER UP AND APPARENTLY SUCCEEDED IN SOME DEGREE BEFORE THE WALK WAS OVER
I WONDER WHICH WILL CONQUER I CONSENTED
BUT I RESOLUTELY SWALLOWED BACK MY EMOTION AND ANSWERED CALMLY YOU THINK NOT NO REPLIED HE BOLDLY
HELEN SAID HE HE FREQUENTLY CALLED ME HELEN AND I NEVER RESENTED THE FREEDOM I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS PICTURE
HOW DARE YOU MENTION HIS NAME TO ME WAS THE ONLY ANSWER I GAVE
INSTEAD OF ACTING LIKE A TRUE FRIEND CONTINUED SHE BREAKING FROM ME AND THROWING HERSELF INTO THE OLD ARM-CHAIR AND HELPING ME WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT--OR RATHER TAKING YOUR OWN PART IN THE STRUGGLE OF RIGHT AGAINST PASSION--YOU LEAVE ALL THE BURDEN TO ME;--AND NOT SATISFIED WITH THAT YOU DO YOUR UTMOST TO FIGHT AGAINST ME--WHEN YOU KNOW THAT SHE PAUSED AND HID HER FACE IN HER HANDKERCHIEF
WE SHALL HAVE THUNDER-SHOWERS BEFORE NIGHT I IMAGINE AND THEY ARE JUST IN THE MIDST OF STACKING MY CORN
IT IS LONG SINCE I SAW YOU MARKHAM SAID HE AFTER THE FIRST FEW WORDS HAD PASSED BETWEEN US
RECEIVING NO ENCOURAGEMENT IN THAT EITHER HE DROPPED IT BUT DID NOT DEPART
FOR NO ONE COULD CALL HIM A JOLLY COMPANION I'M SURE,--AND BESIDES HE APPEARS TOO SOBER AND GENTLEMANLY IN HIS DEMEANOUR TO MERIT SUCH SUSPICIONS
YOU ARE IMMEASURABLY HAPPIER THAN I AM I AM VERY SORRY FOR YOU THEN I COULD NOT HELP REPLYING
I BEGAN TO THINK WHY AM I HURRYING SO FAST IN THIS DIRECTION
IT IS EXACTLY FOUR MONTHS SINCE I OPENED IT LAST
I FOUND INDEED SOME PASSAGES THAT TAKEN BY THEMSELVES MIGHT SEEM TO CONTRADICT THAT OPINION
COME NOW YOU SHALL TELL ME DO LET ME ALONE RALPH
I NOW RECOLLECTED HAVING SEEN MRS WILSON IN THE EARLY PART OF THE EVENING EDGING HER CHAIR CLOSE UP TO MY MOTHER AND BENDING FORWARD EVIDENTLY IN THE DELIVERY OF SOME IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE
YOU SAY THAT ANNABELLA IS NOT YET RETURNED YES YES--GO ON SAID I IMPATIENTLY
HERE YOU FELLOW--SCOUNDREL--DOG--GIVE ME YOUR HAND AND I'LL HELP YOU TO MOUNT NO
WHILE HE IS TOO SELFISH TO CONSIDER HOW MANY COMFORTS MIGHT BE OBTAINED FOR HIS FOND MOTHER AND SISTERS WITH THE MONEY HE THUS WASTES UPON HIMSELF
AS USUAL--THAT IS FAR FROM HAPPY AND FAR FROM STRONG SHE IS NOT POSITIVELY ILL RETURNED HE
SHE IS A SWEET GOOD GIRL AND I WISH I WERE LIKE HER--MORE LIKE HER AT LEAST THAN I AM
BUT YOU WILL NOT DO IT
NOT LIKING THIS ABRUPT REMOVAL THE CHILD BEGAN TO POUT AND CRY
THERE WAS NO NECESSITY FOR IT FOR I HAD NO DOUBT THAT SUCH WAS HER DETERMINATION TO FORGET ME YES MARKHAM
I MERELY SAID THAT I WAS OF VERY DOMESTIC HABITS AS HE WELL KNEW AND HAD NO PARTICULAR WISH TO MINGLE WITH THE WORLD
HE WHISTLED AND TALKED TO HIS DOGS AND WANDERED FROM ROOM TO ROOM MUCH THE SAME AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
OUR ARBOUR WAS SET SNUGLY BACK IN A CORNER BEFORE WHICH THE AVENUE AT ITS TERMINATION TURNED OFF INTO THE MORE AIRY WALK ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN
ALREADY I BELIEVE HE KNOWS MUCH MORE OF MY SITUATION THAN I HAVE TOLD HIM
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU THINK YOURSELF MORE FIT TO DIE THERE WAS A PAINFUL PAUSE
BUT I WAS IN NO HUMOUR FOR JESTING
NOW GET ME A GLASS OF WINE SAID HE TO REMEDY WHAT YOU'VE DONE YOU SHE TIGER
AND WHEN HE WAS BEGINNING TO TALK ABOUT HER THE OTHER DAY I BEGGED HE WOULD NOT MENTION HER FOR I DETESTED THE VERY SOUND OF HER NAME
I TOOK HIS HAND AGAIN AND HELD IT TILL HE WAS NO MORE--AND THEN I FAINTED
AT LENGTH HOWEVER HE WITHDREW AND WENT TO THE LADY OF THE HOUSE APPARENTLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASKING AN INTRODUCTION TO ME FOR SHORTLY AFTER THEY BOTH CAME UP AND SHE INTRODUCED HIM AS MR HUNTINGDON THE SON OF A LATE FRIEND OF MY UNCLE'S
I HAD NOT COURAGE TO CONTRADICT THEM THEN AND HOW CAN I DO IT NOW
STILL AS I MUSED THE NAKED ROOM C
AND I LOVE THEE MILICENT BUT I DON'T ADORE THEE IN PROOF OF HIS AFFECTION HE CLUTCHED A HANDFUL OF HER LIGHT BROWN RINGLETS AND APPEARED TO TWIST THEM UNMERCIFULLY
IF HE SAID YES I WOULD VENTURE TO INQUIRE HOW IS SHE BUT NEVER HOW IS HER HUSBAND THOUGH I MIGHT BE BURNING TO KNOW
I HAD A LETTER FROM HIM THIS MORNING
SHE MAY BE LIVING YET FOR ANYTHING I OR ANY OF HER RELATIVES OR FORMER ACQUAINTANCES CAN TELL
UNCONSCIOUS OF MY PRESENCE HE BEGAN TO PACE THE ROOM IN A STATE OF FEARFUL AGITATION VIOLENTLY WRINGING HIS HANDS AND UTTERING LOW GROANS OR INCOHERENT EJACULATIONS
AND WHEN SHE HERSELF PASSED AWAY FOUR YEARS LATER SHE HAD SO TURNED THOSE YEARS TO ACCOUNT THAT NOT ONLY ALL SHE DID BUT ALL SHE LOVED HAD PASSED SILENTLY INTO THE KEEPING OF FAME
ROSE INFORMED ME THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE FAVOURED US WITH HIS COMPANY BUT FOR THE IMPORTUNITIES OF HIS SISTER JANE WHO WAS MOST ANXIOUS TO SHOW MR LAWRENCE THAT SHE HAD AT LEAST ONE BROTHER MORE GENTLEMANLY AND REFINED THAN ROBERT
AND I'D TALK TOO I JUST WOULD--I'D LET HIM KNOW WHAT IT WAS TO I HAVE TALKED SAID I
THAT'S ENTAILED YOU KNOW I WISH TO GOD I COULD SELL IT TO PAY MY DEBTS HE MUTTERED
MANY YEARS AFTER ANNE'S DEATH HER BROTHER-IN-LAW PROTESTED AGAINST A SUPPOSED PORTRAIT OF HER AS GIVING A TOTALLY WRONG IMPRESSION OF THE DEAR GENTLE ANNE BRONTE DEAR AND GENTLE INDEED SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THROUGH LIFE THE YOUNGEST AND PRETTIEST OF THE SISTERS WITH A DELICATE COMPLEXION A SLENDER NECK AND SMALL PLEASANT FEATURES
AND WHEN WE ARE TOLD THAT MEN AND WOMEN DO NOT PLAY WITH TOYS AND THAT OUR COMPANIONS WILL ONE DAY WEARY OF THE TRIVIAL SPORTS AND OCCUPATIONS THAT INTEREST THEM AND US SO DEEPLY NOW WE CANNOT HELP BEING SADDENED AT THE THOUGHTS OF SUCH AN ALTERATION BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONCEIVE THAT AS WE GROW UP OUR OWN MINDS WILL BECOME SO ENLARGED AND ELEVATED THAT WE OURSELVES SHALL THEN REGARD AS TRIFLING THOSE OBJECTS AND PURSUITS WE NOW SO FONDLY CHERISH AND THAT THOUGH OUR COMPANIONS WILL NO LONGER JOIN US IN THOSE CHILDISH PASTIMES THEY WILL DRINK WITH US AT OTHER FOUNTAINS OF DELIGHT AND MINGLE THEIR SOULS WITH OURS IN HIGHER AIMS AND NOBLER OCCUPATIONS BEYOND OUR PRESENT COMPREHENSION BUT NOT LESS DEEPLY RELISHED OR LESS TRULY GOOD FOR THAT WHILE YET BOTH WE AND THEY REMAIN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME INDIVIDUALS AS BEFORE
IT WAS WRONG IT WAS WRONG HE MUTTERED AT LENGTH
HIGH TIME MY GIRL--HIGH TIME
FOR WHEN I HAD LAID ASIDE MY PEN AND WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE THE BOOK HE SUDDENLY PLACED HIS HAND UPON IT AND SAYING,--'WITH YOUR LEAVE MY DEAR I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THIS FORCIBLY WRESTED IT FROM ME AND DRAWING A CHAIR TO THE TABLE COMPOSEDLY SAT DOWN TO EXAMINE IT
AND THOUGH REFRAINING ENTIRELY FROM ANY ACTIVE OPPOSITION TO THE MATCH HE WOULD YET DO NOTHING TO BRING IT ABOUT AND WOULD MUCH RATHER TAKE THE PART OF PRUDENCE IN AIDING US TO OVERCOME OUR MUTUAL PREDILECTIONS THAN THAT OF FEELING TO ENCOURAGE THEM
BUT THESE WERE HER ONLY ACCOMPLISHMENTS
ON MY MOTHER'S ACCOUNT I CHOSE THE LATTER
ON THE CONTRARY IT IS YOUR OWN HAPPINESS I LONG FOR MORE THAN MINE
I LAY THEM BOTH TO THE CHARGE OF HIS HARSH YET CARELESS FATHER AND HIS MADLY INDULGENT MOTHER.--IF EVER I AM A MOTHER I WILL ZEALOUSLY STRIVE AGAINST THIS CRIME OF OVER-INDULGENCE
FOR I CAME NOT TO GIVE PLEASURE BUT TO SEEK IT I ANSWERED
GILBERT DON'T SHE CRIED IN A TONE THAT WOULD HAVE PIERCED A HEART OF ADAMANT
BUT HE WAS IN FOR IT NOW
FIRST STUDY
IT WAS PLAIN HE KNEW HIS WRONGS AT LAST
IF YOU LEAVE YOUR CHAIR IT'LL DO JUST AS WELL--BETTER A TRIFLE HE MUTTERED AS I LEFT THE ROOM FOR I CAN FANCY SOMEBODY ELSE FILLS IT SOMEBODY ELSE MAY FILL IT TO-MORROW I THOUGHT BUT DID NOT SAY
MANY WOULD BE GLAD TO TELL HER SUCH NEWS JUST TO SEE HOW SHE WOULD TAKE IT
TRUST ME GILBERT
I DON'T TAKE WINE MRS MARKHAM SAID MR MILLWARD UPON THE INTRODUCTION OF THAT BEVERAGE
IT IS PARTLY FROM A FEELING OF SPITE TO YOUR TORMENTORS THAT MAKES ME DELIGHTED TO DO THE OLD FELLOWS A BAD TURN THOUGH I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY GREAT REASON TO DREAD THEM AS RIVALS
SUPPRESSING A NEW BURST OF MERRIMENT HATTERSLEY POINTED TO THE OUTER DOOR
MR HARGRAVE FOLLOWED ME THITHER UNDER PRETENCE OF COMING FOR A BOOK
I HAVE NO REST DAY OR NIGHT
THOUGH WEARIED WITH HIS SO PERTINACIOUSLY RETURNING TO THE SAME POINT AND REPEATING THE SAME ARGUMENTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN FORCING ME TO REITERATE THE SAME REPLIES I AT LENGTH TURNED SHORT AND SHARP UPON HIM AND MY LAST WORDS WERE,--'I TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT IT CANNOT BE
HAD SHE HEARD BAD NEWS FROM HER FRIENDS
OR WILL YOU BE MORE QUIET IF I GO AND SEND THE NURSE OH YES YOU'RE WONDROUS GENTLE AND OBLIGING
SHE'S QUITE A PATTERN TO HER SEX HELEN
AND ON ANY OF THESE OCCASIONS WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER IN MY SOLITARY WALKS OR RIDES OR WHILE FOLLOWING MY AGRICULTURAL PURSUITS I GENERALLY CONTRIVED TO MEET OR OVERTAKE HER FOR I RATHER LIKED TO SEE MRS GRAHAM AND TO TALK TO HER AND I DECIDEDLY LIKED TO TALK TO HER LITTLE COMPANION WHOM WHEN ONCE THE ICE OF HIS SHYNESS WAS FAIRLY BROKEN I FOUND TO BE A VERY AMIABLE INTELLIGENT AND ENTERTAINING LITTLE FELLOW
BUT HAPPILY SHE WAS NOT
NOW I FORGOT MY OWN AFFLICTIONS AND THOUGHT ONLY OF HIS
YES IMMEDIATELY THAT'S RIGHT
WHAT TAKES YOU OFF SO SOON MAY I ASK BUSINESS RETURNED HE REPELLING THE OTHER'S INCREDULOUS SNEER WITH A GLANCE OF SCORNFUL DEFIANCE
I SUPPOSE NOW YOU'D NEVER DREAM OF LOOKING INTO THE STATE OF YOUR HUSBAND'S FINANCES OR TROUBLING YOUR HEAD ABOUT SETTLEMENTS OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT I DON'T THINK I SHOULD WELL BE THANKFUL THEN THAT YOU'VE WISER HEADS TO THINK FOR YOU
AND I BY HIS EXPRESS DESIRE SUCCEEDED HIM IN THE SAME QUIET OCCUPATION NOT VERY WILLINGLY FOR AMBITION URGED ME TO HIGHER AIMS AND SELF-CONCEIT ASSURED ME THAT IN DISREGARDING ITS VOICE I WAS BURYING MY TALENT IN THE EARTH AND HIDING MY LIGHT UNDER A BUSHEL
FOR HE DOTH NOT AFFLICT WILLINGLY NOR GRIEVE THE CHILDREN OF MEN I OUGHT TO THINK OF THIS
FOR HAD SHE CHOSEN TO CONSIDER HERSELF THE VICTIM OF FATE OR OF HER MOTHER'S WORLDLY WISDOM SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY MISERABLE
AT LAST HE SUDDENLY DISCOVERED THAT THE LONDON AIR DID NOT AGREE WITH ME AND I WAS LANGUISHING FOR MY COUNTRY HOME AND MUST IMMEDIATELY RETURN TO GRASSDALE
AND I SHALL HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM TO-MORROW--OR AT ANY TIME HENCE
I HAVE RETIRED TO THE LIBRARY FOR I AM VERY UNHAPPY AND I WANT TO BE ALONE
IF YOU TORMENT ME IN THIS WAY ANY MORE I MUST CONCLUDE THAT YOUR PROTESTATIONS ARE ENTIRELY FALSE AND THAT YOU HATE ME IN YOUR HEART AS FERVENTLY AS YOU PROFESS TO LOVE ME HE BIT HIS LIP AND BENT HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND IN SILENCE FOR A WHILE
SHE'D A RARE LONG PURSE AND MR HARGRAVE WANTED IT ALL TO HISSELF
FOR THE EVENINGS NOW ARE DARK AND DAMP AND ARTHUR I FEAR IS TOO DELICATE TO RISK EXPOSURE TO THEIR INFLUENCE WITH IMPUNITY
BUT I LET HIM KNOW THAT I INTENSELY DISLIKE SUCH EXHIBITIONS
BELIEVE ME MATRIMONY IS A SERIOUS THING AND SHE SPOKE IT SO SERIOUSLY THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE FANCIED SHE HAD KNOWN IT TO HER COST
IN VAIN HAD SHE REMONSTRATED IN VAIN SHE HAD MINGLED HIS WINE WITH WATER
BUT THERE WAS A DEPTH OF MALICE IN HER TOO EXPRESSIVE EYE THAT PLAINLY TOLD ME I WAS NOT FORGIVEN
NO NO BY HEAVEN YOU SHA'N'T ESCAPE ME SO HE CRIED
AT PRESENT I AM ENJOYING A TEMPORARY RELIEF FROM HIS PRESENCE
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU COULD AND WOULD TOO
TO SUBJECT HER TO THE STRUGGLES OF CONFLICTING DUTY AND INCLINATION--TO WHICHSOEVER SIDE THE LATTER MIGHT ALLURE OR THE FORMER IMPERATIVELY CALL HER--WHETHER SHE SHOULD DEEM IT HER DUTY TO RISK THE SLIGHTS AND CENSURES OF THE WORLD THE SORROW AND DISPLEASURE OF THOSE SHE LOVED FOR A ROMANTIC IDEA OF TRUTH AND CONSTANCY TO ME OR TO SACRIFICE HER INDIVIDUAL WISHES TO THE FEELINGS OF HER FRIENDS AND HER OWN SENSE OF PRUDENCE AND THE FITNESS OF THINGS
I TOLD MISS WILMOT SO
IT SEEMED WRONG THAT THERE SHOULD EXIST A SECRET UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN MY HUSBAND'S FRIEND AND ME UNKNOWN TO HIM OF WHICH HE WAS THE OBJECT
FOR I CAN'T LIVE ALONE BECAUSE MY OWN MIND DISTRACTS ME AND I CAN'T LIVE WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU TAKE THE DEVIL'S PART AGAINST ME WHO--I YES--ALL OF YOU DO--AND YOU MORE THAN ANY OF THEM YOU KNOW
I FELT THAT TO OBTRUDE MY CONSOLATIONS ON HER THEN WOULD ONLY SERVE TO AGGRAVATE HER SUFFERINGS
AND I WAS QUICKLY INFORMED THAT TO HER HAD BEEN LEFT THE FULL CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF THE ESTATE DURING HER SON'S MINORITY BESIDES THE ABSOLUTE UNCONDITIONAL POSSESSION OF HER OWN FORTUNE BUT I KNEW THAT HER FATHER HAD NOT GIVEN HER MUCH AND THE SMALL ADDITIONAL SUM THAT HAD BEEN SETTLED UPON HER BEFORE MARRIAGE
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF HER--BUT I DARESAY YOU CAN TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT HER FOR SHE IS YOUR TENANT YOU KNOW,--AND SHE SAID SHE KNEW YOU A LITTLE ALL EYES WERE TURNED TO MR LAWRENCE
THAT'S FOR MISS ELIZA NOW HE PRONOUNCED THIS WITH A TONE AND LOOK SO PRODIGIOUSLY KNOWING THAT I WAS GLAD TO CONTRADICT HIM
HER LAST LETTER WAS FULL OF PRESENT BLISS AND PLEASING ANTICIPATIONS FOR THE FUTURE
BUT NOW HIS PASSION AND HER ART TOGETHER HAVE BLINDED HIM TO EVERYTHING BUT HER PERFECTIONS AND HIS AMAZING GOOD FORTUNE
AND WAS HE COME TO WITNESS THE RESULT AND TRIUMPH IN MY DESPAIR
HERE COACHMAN THANK'EE SIR.--ALL RIGHT THE COACHMAN POCKETED HIS FEE AND DROVE AWAY LEAVING ME NOT WALKING UP THE PARK BUT PACING TO AND FRO BEFORE ITS GATES WITH FOLDED ARMS AND EYES FIXED UPON THE GROUND AN OVERWHELMING FORCE OF IMAGES THOUGHTS IMPRESSIONS CROWDING ON MY MIND AND NOTHING TANGIBLY DISTINCT BUT THIS
LOOK TO YOUR QUEEN THE COMBAT DEEPENED
YOU MAY THINK IT ALL VERY FINE MR HUNTINGDON TO AMUSE YOURSELF WITH ROUSING MY JEALOUSY
FOR THOUGH I SAW SHE WAS MISERABLE AND PITIED HER I FELT GLAD TO HAVE IT IN MY POWER TO TORMENT HER
SHE TOLD ME FROM THE FIRST SHE WAS DOWN OF THAT NEW GOVERNESS AND I SOON FOUND SHE WATCHED HER QUITE AS NARROWLY AS I DID
BUT HE WAS TOO PREOCCUPIED TO NOTICE IT
BUT WHEN WE HAVE TO DO WITH VICE AND VICIOUS CHARACTERS I MAINTAIN IT IS BETTER TO DEPICT THEM AS THEY REALLY ARE THAN AS THEY WOULD WISH TO APPEAR
WHAT DO YOU WANT RALPH MURMURED SHE RELUCTANTLY APPROACHING HIM
A VERY BLESSED CONSIDERATION IF IT WILL ONLY SECURE ME FROM THE PAIN AND WORRY OF MY DEAR ANXIOUS WIFE'S EFFORTS TO CONVERT ME AND HER FROM THE TOIL AND TROUBLE OF SUCH EXERTIONS AND HER SWEET FACE AND SILVER ACCENTS FROM THE RUINOUS EFFECTS OF THE SAME
I BREATHED MORE FREELY
AND YOU MR HUNTINGDON IT SEEMS WERE THE FIRST TO TEMPT HIM WELL WHAT COULD WE DO REPLIED HE DEPRECATINGLY.--'WE MEANT IT IN KINDNESS--WE COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE THE POOR FELLOW SO MISERABLE:--AND BESIDES HE WAS SUCH A DAMPER UPON US SITTING THERE SILENT AND GLUM WHEN HE WAS UNDER THE THREEFOLD INFLUENCE--OF THE LOSS OF HIS SWEETHEART THE LOSS OF HIS FORTUNE AND THE REACTION OF THE LOST NIGHT'S DEBAUCH
NOT ON FOOT NO MADAM BY COACH HERE'S RACHEL SIR SAID ARTHUR THE ONLY TRULY HAPPY ONE AMONGST US DIRECTING MY ATTENTION TO THAT WORTHY INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD JUST ENTERED TO TAKE HER MISTRESS'S THINGS
SCARCELY HAD I REACHED IT WHEN A SOUND OF VOICES ARRESTED MY BREATHLESS SPEED
AND WILMOT AND I ARE GOING TO BEAT YOU ALL
I DO BELIEVE A YOUNG LADY CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL WHO SHE MARRIES OF COURSE NOT SAID I
I CONSOLED HIM WITH THE HOPE THAT PERHAPS HIS PAPA WOULD ALTER AND BECOME GOOD BEFORE HE DIED
BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF SO DISGRACEFULLY CONFOUND YOU MADAM MUTTERED HE WITH A STARE OF STUPID AMAZEMENT AT MY IMPUDENCE IT WAS NOT THAT--WAS IT MILICENT SHE WAS SILENT
HOW LITTLE REAL SYMPATHY THERE EXISTS BETWEEN US
IT CLUNG TO THE TOPMOST STONE AND THEN ANOTHER LITTLE HAND WAS RAISED TO TAKE A FIRMER HOLD AND THEN APPEARED A SMALL WHITE FOREHEAD SURMOUNTED WITH WREATHS OF LIGHT BROWN HAIR WITH A PAIR OF DEEP BLUE EYES BENEATH AND THE UPPER PORTION OF A DIMINUTIVE IVORY NOSE
NO EXCLAIMED HE WITH HARSH AND STARTLING EMPHASIS
I HAD NOT PROCEEDED MANY STEPS ON MY WAY HOMEWARDS WHEN I PERCEIVED MR LAWRENCE ON HIS PRETTY GREY PONY COMING UP THE RUGGED LANE THAT CROSSED OVER THE HILL-TOP
BUT HIS FAVOURITE COCKER DASH THAT HAD BEEN LYING AT MY FEET TOOK THE LIBERTY OF JUMPING UPON HIM AND BEGINNING TO LICK HIS FACE
WELL AND I QUESTIONED THIS YOUNG SPARK ON THE MATTER OF SETTLEMENTS CONTINUED HE
I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA HAVE YOU SO CLEAR AN IDEA THAT YOU CAN HEAR WITHOUT SURPRISE OR DISAPPROVAL THAT I MEDITATE ESCAPING WITH THAT CHILD TO SOME SECRET ASYLUM WHERE WE CAN LIVE IN PEACE AND NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN IS IT REALLY SO IF YOU HAVE NOT CONTINUED I I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE ABOUT HIM
NOW THEN MY MAN GIVE ME THE REINS AND WE'LL RETURN TO M I MUST HAVE SOME BREAKFAST AT THE ROSE AND CROWN AND THEN AWAY TO STANINGLEY BY THE FIRST COACH FOR AT M I HAD TIME BEFORE THE COACH STARTED TO REPLENISH MY FORCES WITH A HEARTY BREAKFAST AND TO OBTAIN THE REFRESHMENT OF MY USUAL MORNING'S ABLUTIONS AND THE AMELIORATION OF SOME SLIGHT CHANGE IN MY TOILET AND ALSO TO DESPATCH A SHORT NOTE TO MY MOTHER EXCELLENT SON THAT I WAS TO ASSURE HER THAT I WAS STILL IN EXISTENCE AND TO EXCUSE MY NON-APPEARANCE AT THE EXPECTED TIME
AND THOUGH IF EVER I WIN HEAVEN AT ALL I MUST I KNOW BE INFINITELY BETTER AND HAPPIER THAN I AM NOW MY EARTHLY NATURE CANNOT REJOICE IN THE ANTICIPATION OF SUCH BEATITUDE FROM WHICH ITSELF AND ITS CHIEF JOY MUST BE EXCLUDED IS YOUR LOVE ALL EARTHLY THEN NO BUT I AM SUPPOSING WE SHALL HAVE NO MORE INTIMATE COMMUNION WITH EACH OTHER THAN WITH THE REST IF SO IT WILL BE BECAUSE WE LOVE THEM MORE AND NOT EACH OTHER LESS
CHAPTER II I PERCEIVE WITH JOY MY MOST VALUED FRIEND THAT THE CLOUD OF YOUR DISPLEASURE HAS PASSED AWAY
AND YET PERHAPS I AM WRONG
YES DEAREST BUT ONLY TO LOVE YOU THE BETTER WHEN I COME BACK AND MAKE UP FOR ALL PAST OFFENCES AND SHORT-COMINGS
AND HE ALWAYS HAD A PARTIALITY FOR THIS ONE
HERE THEY BOTH ARE CRIED MY MOTHER LOOKING ROUND UPON US WITHOUT RETARDING THE MOTION OF HER NIMBLE FINGERS AND GLITTERING NEEDLES
YOUR MISTRESS WON'T WANT THEM ANY MORE BENSON PAUSED AGHAST AND LOOKED AT ME
HE SAW THAT I WISHED THE CONVERSATION TO END
BUT NO RAY OF SUNSHINE COULD REACH MY HEART NO BREEZE COULD FRESHEN IT
BUT I COULD NOT TALK TO HER--I COULD TALK TO NO ONE AND UPON THE INTRODUCTION OF TEA I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPEN DOOR AND THE SLIGHT DIVERSION CAUSED BY ITS ENTRANCE TO SLIP OUT--FOR I WAS SURE I COULD NOT TAKE ANY--AND TAKE REFUGE IN THE LIBRARY
I'M COME TO HELP YOU NOW:--AND WOE BE TO THAT MAN OR WOMAN EITHER THAT PAUSES FOR A MOMENT AMONGST YOU--WHETHER TO STARE ABOUT HIM TO SCRATCH HIS HEAD OR BLOW HIS NOSE--NO PRETEXT WILL SERVE--NOTHING BUT WORK WORK WORK IN THE SWEAT OF YOUR FACE C C
IN VAIN I ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE HIM AWAY BY GIVING A LOOSE TO MY EXASPERATED FEELINGS EVEN TO POSITIVE RUDENESS
AND WHEN SHE LOOKED AT HIS EAGER FACE SHE SMILED AND LET HIM GO
DID YOU EVER HEAR SUCH NONSENSE AS THEY TALK MRS HUNTINGDON HE CONTINUED
I WONDER YOU CAN HE REPROACHED HER WITH A LOOK OF MINGLED BITTERNESS AND SURPRISE AND SINKING INTO A CHAIR SUPPRESSED A HEAVY SIGH BIT HIS PALE LIPS AND FIXED HIS EYES UPON THE FLOOR
BUT AN APOLOGY FOR INVADING THE HERMITAGE WAS STILL NECESSARY
HE HAS A GOOD DISPOSITION IS HE A MAN OF PRINCIPLE PERHAPS NOT EXACTLY
FOR WHEN A LADY DOES CONSENT TO LISTEN TO AN ARGUMENT AGAINST HER OWN OPINIONS SHE IS ALWAYS PREDETERMINED TO WITHSTAND IT--TO LISTEN ONLY WITH HER BODILY EARS KEEPING THE MENTAL ORGANS RESOLUTELY CLOSED AGAINST THE STRONGEST REASONING GOOD-MORNING MR MARKHAM SAID MY FAIR ANTAGONIST WITH A PITYING SMILE
A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND PAINFUL UNDERTAKING AND THEREFORE I HAD LEFT IT TO THE LAST
THAT BOTH OF THEM WERE GONE WITH MRS MAXWELL BACK TO STANINGLEY AND THERE THEY STAYED AT LEAST THREE MONTHS
FOR I SAW HE DID NOT WISH TO BE QUESTIONED ABOUT YOU OR TO AFFORD THE SLIGHTEST ENCOURAGEMENT OR ASSISTANCE TO MY TOO OBSTINATE ATTACHMENT HELEN DID NOT REPLY
WON'T YOU GILBERT--AS SOON AS YOU'VE HAD SOMETHING TO EAT NO NO--HOW CAN WE TELL THAT IT ISN'T ALL A FALSE REPORT
BEING A MAN OF TASTE HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ON THIS SUBJECT AS WELL AS ANOTHER AND HAVING MODESTLY COMMENTED ON IT WITHOUT MUCH ENCOURAGEMENT FROM ME HE PROCEEDED TO EXPATIATE ON THE ART IN GENERAL
MY NEXT GOOD OFFICE WAS TO CATCH HIS PONY AND BRING IT TO HIM WHICH WAS SOON ACCOMPLISHED
WHEN HER FATHER ASKED HER AT FOUR YEARS OLD WHAT A LITTLE CHILD LIKE HER WANTED MOST THE TINY CREATURE REPLIED--IF IT WERE NOT A BRONTE IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLE!--'AGE AND EXPERIENCE WHEN THE THREE CHILDREN STARTED THEIR ISLAND PLAYS TOGETHER IN 1827 ANNE WHO WAS THEN EIGHT CHOSE GUERNSEY FOR HER IMAGINARY ISLAND AND PEOPLED IT WITH MICHAEL SADLER LORD BENTINCK AND SIR HENRY HALFORD SHE AND EMILY WERE CONSTANT COMPANIONS AND THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY SHARED A COMMON WORLD OF FANCY FROM VERY EARLY DAYS TO MATURE WOMANHOOD
BUT HELEN--OR MRS HUNTINGDON OR WHATEVER YOU WOULD HAVE ME CALL YOU--WILL YOU TELL HIM
MR HUNTINGDON'S ACQUAINTANCES APPEAR TO BE NO BETTER PLEASED WITH OUR APPROACHING UNION THAN MINE
AND SO COLD AS IT IS TOO SAID HE GLANCING WITH DISMAY AT HER SLIGHT DRAPERY AND IMMEDIATELY HANDING HER INTO THE CARRIAGE
ARTHUR ESPECIALLY SHRANK FROM THE RUBY NECTAR AS IF IN TERROR AND DISGUST AND WAS READY TO CRY WHEN URGED TO TAKE IT
I DON'T MUCH CARE
AND I'D COMPASS SEA AND LAND TO GET IT--ONLY I'M AFRAID THERE'S NO CHANCE AND HE SIGHED AS IF HIS HEART WOULD BREAK
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MY BRIDE SAID HE ENDEAVOURING TO HIDE HIS EMBARRASSMENT BY AN ASSUMPTION OF CARELESS GAIETY
THEN I MUST LEAVE YOU SAID HE AT LENGTH LOOKING STEADILY UPON ME AS IF WITH THE LAST HOPE OF DETECTING SOME TOKEN OF IRREPRESSIBLE ANGUISH OR DISMAY AWAKENED BY THOSE SOLEMN WORDS
BUT I PAUSED BESIDE THE GARDEN WALL AND LOOKED AND SAW NO CHANGE--EXCEPT IN ONE WING WHERE THE BROKEN WINDOWS AND DILAPIDATED ROOF HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN REPAIRED AND WHERE A THIN WREATH OF SMOKE WAS CURLING UP FROM THE STACK OF CHIMNEYS
AND EARLY FROST AND SUMMER SUNSHINE MINGLED THEIR SWEETNESS IN THE AIR
HE THEN THREW MY KEYS INTO MY LAP SAYING,--'THERE
BUT I SAW NO MORE
NOW I FLATTER MYSELF I AM MORE CHARITABLE AND CONSIDERATE
BUT TAKING HIM WITH ME INTO THE LIBRARY I SHUT THE DOOR AND KNEELING ON THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM I EMBRACED HIM KISSED HIM WEPT OVER WITH HIM WITH PASSIONATE FONDNESS
HERE I WAS TRANSGRESSING AGAIN
30TH.--ALAS
I MIGHT PASS FOR A MADMAN OR AN IMPERTINENT FOOL--EVEN SHE MIGHT BE OFFENDED AT SUCH AN INTERRUPTION OR AT LEAST MIGHT TELL ME IT WAS NOW TOO LATE
YOU HAD ALL HAD A PEEP AT THIS WONDERFUL STRANGER BUT ME AND I COULD ENDURE MY WRETCHED IGNORANCE NO LONGER--COME WHAT WOULD I MUST BE SATISFIED
I DISMOUNTED HOWEVER AND HAVING FASTENED MY OWN ANIMAL TO THE NEAREST TREE FIRST PICKED UP HIS HAT INTENDING TO CLAP IT ON HIS HEAD
I THINK YOU'RE AN ILL-USED MAN--NAY NOW DON'T FLARE UP
HE USED TO SPEND A MONTH AT STANINGLEY EVERY YEAR BEFORE I WAS MARRIED
MR HARGRAVE SUGGESTED I WITH A BITTER SMILE
AND OH I WOULD SOONER BURN IT ALL THAN HE SHOULD READ WHAT I HAD WRITTEN WHEN I WAS SUCH A FOOL AS TO LOVE HIM
THE CASTELLATED TOWERS OF LAUREL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN THE GIGANTIC WARRIOR THAT STOOD ON ONE SIDE OF THE GATEWAY AND THE LION THAT GUARDED THE OTHER WERE SPROUTED INTO SUCH FANTASTIC SHAPES AS RESEMBLED NOTHING EITHER IN HEAVEN OR EARTH OR IN THE WATERS UNDER THE EARTH
I'VE HEARD HIM SAY HE'S A FINE LAD THAT YOUNG HUNTINGDON BUT A BIT WILDISH I FANCY SO I'D HAVE YOU BEWARE WHAT DOES A BIT WILDISH MEAN I INQUIRED
YOU'D HAVE DONE A DEAL BETTER IF YOU'D TAKEN WILMOT I CAN TELL YOU
BUT SUCH WAS HIS INEXPERIENCE AND SUCH WERE THE LADY'S POWERS OF ATTRACTION AND HER SKILL IN BRINGING THEM TO BEAR UPON HIS YOUNG IMAGINATION THAT THEY HAD NOT DISTURBED HIM LONG
IT MAY BE VERY TRUE--AND I HOPE IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW MEN WHOM YOU WOULD CHOOSE TO MARRY OF YOURSELF
IN THE FIRST PLACE HER GENTLE AND DELICATE PRESENCE HER SAD SHORT STORY HER HARD LIFE AND EARLY DEATH ENTER DEEPLY INTO THE POETRY AND TRAGEDY THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ENTWINED WITH THE MEMORY OF THE BRONTES AS WOMEN AND AS WRITERS
TILL THEN FAREWELL GILBERT MARKHAM
HEREAFTER--YOU SMILE MRS GRAHAM SAID I SUDDENLY STOPPING SHORT CHECKED IN MY PASSIONATE DECLAMATION BY UNUTTERABLE FEELINGS TO BEHOLD HER ACTUALLY SMILING AT THE PICTURE OF THE RUIN SHE HAD WROUGHT
NOT LATELY I REPLIED
TO COME UPON HER NOW WHEN SHE WAS REINSTATED IN HER PROPER SPHERE AND CLAIM A SHARE IN HER PROSPERITY WHICH HAD IT NEVER FAILED HER WOULD MOST CERTAINLY HAVE KEPT HER UNKNOWN TO ME FOR EVER
HE WANTED TO HURRY IT OVER FOR ALL THE CONTINENTAL SCENES WERE ALREADY FAMILIAR TO HIM
I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW THEM TO YOU LOVE SAID HE
BUT ADDED HE LAUGHING I DIDN'T EXPECT IT WOULD MEET ITS END THIS WAY
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO MARRY ELIZA MILLWARD YOU THOUGHT WRONG THEN
WHEN I TELL YOU NOT TO MARRY WITHOUT LOVE I DO NOT ADVISE YOU TO MARRY FOR LOVE ALONE
HE MUST HAVE A FRIEND OR TWO TO HELP HIM
BUT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO MAKE THE REQUEST AND IT WAS NOT TILL AFTER HE WAS GONE THAT I SAW HOW FAIR AN OPPORTUNITY I HAD LOST
I GAVE HER SOME USEFUL PIECES OF INFORMATION HOWEVER AND SEVERAL EXCELLENT RECEIPTS THE VALUE OF WHICH SHE EVIDENTLY COULD NOT APPRECIATE FOR SHE BEGGED I WOULD NOT TROUBLE MYSELF AS SHE LIVED IN SUCH A PLAIN QUIET WAY THAT SHE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD NEVER MAKE USE OF THEM
YOU SHOULD NOT LET IT WORRY YOU SO MUCH HELEN SAID HE
BUT IF THE OLD LADY'S EULOGIES ARE CORRECT YOU WILL FIND HER TO POSSESS ALL DESIRABLE QUALIFICATIONS FOR HER POSITION
AND THEN IN HIS SOBER MOMENTS HE SO BOTHERED HIS FRIENDS WITH HIS REMORSE AND HIS TERRORS AND WOES THAT THEY WERE OBLIGED IN SELF-DEFENCE TO GET HIM TO DROWN HIS SORROWS IN WINE OR ANY MORE POTENT BEVERAGE THAT CAME TO HAND
BUT I SHALL EXPECT A VERY HANDSOME APOLOGY SOME TIME MIND AND SCORES OF LETTERS BEFORE WE MEET AGAIN HE SHOOK MY HAND AND HASTENED TO TAKE HIS PLACE BESIDE HIS LADY
THE LIGHT OF THE BODY IS THE EYE OBSERVED HARGRAVE WITH A SARCASTIC SMILE
WHEN SHE WAS RETURNED TO THE SILENCE AND SOLITUDE OF HER OWN HOME IT WOULD BE MY FITTEST OPPORTUNITY
FREDERICK WAS EXCEEDINGLY INDIGNANT AGAINST MR HUNTINGDON AND VERY MUCH GRIEVED FOR ME
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T ANSWERED I
INSTEAD OF THAT HE APPEARED NOT ONLY TO HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL FORMER OFFENCES BUT TO BE IMPENETRABLE TO ALL PRESENT INCIVILITIES
HOW CAN THAT MAKE YOU BETTER WITH SOME COAXING AND PERSUASION I GOT HIM TO LEAVE THE TABLE
I OFTEN CRY WHEN I AM HAPPY AND SMILE WHEN I AM SAD SHE LOOKED AT ME AGAIN AND SEEMED TO EXPECT A REPLY
I SLIPPED TWO GUINEAS INTO HIS HAND BY WAY OF REMEMBRANCE AS HE STOOD IN THE DOORWAY HOLDING THE CANDLE TO LIGHT OUR DEPARTURE WITH A TEAR IN HIS HONEST GREY EYE AND A HOST OF GOOD WISHES DEPICTED ON HIS SOLEMN COUNTENANCE
IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU SEE HIS LIFE DID HARM TO OTHERS AND EVIDENTLY NO GOOD TO HIMSELF
WHY SHOULD I
I HAD NOT LOOKED THROUGH HALF THE BOOK BEFORE MRS MAXWELL APPEARED TO INVITE ME INTO THE OTHER ROOM TO LUNCH
TRUST MY WORDS RATHER THAN YOUR OWN FEELINGS NOW AND IN A FEW YEARS YOU WILL SEE THAT I WAS RIGHT--THOUGH AT PRESENT I HARDLY CAN SEE IT MYSELF SHE MURMURED WITH A SIGH AS SHE RESTED HER HEAD ON HER HAND
SHE IS I KNOW A COMELY MATRON STILL AND DOUBTLESS NO LESS LOVELY--IN YOUR EYES--THAN ON THE HAPPY DAY YOU FIRST BEHELD HER
AT LAST I SAID,--'HOW DO YOU REGARD ME SWEET ANGEL I ADORE YOU
WHEN YOU BEHAVE ILL HER CAUSES OF TERROR AND MISERY ARE MORE THAN ANY ONE CAN TELL BUT HERSELF
I HAVE GOOD REASON TO REMEMBER HIS PRESENCE THERE FOR THIS WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM
YOU DIDN'T INTRUST HIM TO ME BY-THE-BY I GRUMBLED THOUGH I HAD THE HONOUR OF A MUCH LONGER ACQUAINTANCE
GOOD HEAVENS I MUST BE GONE CRIED SHE SUDDENLY BREAKING FROM HIM AND AWAY SHE FLEW
SHE NEVER GIVES HIM A WORD OF REPROACH OR COMPLAINT DO WHAT HE WILL
BUT COULD I DO SO BY FAWNING UPON HIM AND CARESSING HIM WHEN I KNOW THAT HE SCORNS ME
AND SHE WITHDREW AND AT LENGTH I HAD THE SATISFACTION TO HEAR HER CLOSE HER OWN DOOR
WHAT ON MY BOY I THINK THERE'S A HORSE IN THAT FIELD REPLIED HE POINTING TO WHERE THE STRONG BLACK MARE WAS PULLING THE ROLLER
SHE COULD NOT BE SO FRANTIC EXCLAIMED I VEHEMENTLY GRASPING HIS ARM AS IF TO FORCE HIM TO UNSAY THOSE HATEFUL WORDS
WELL BUT ONLY REMEMBER THE OCCASION
ONE FELLOW EVEN VENTURED TO RALLY ME UPON IT--BUT I SILENCED HIM WITH A LOOK THAT QUELLED HIM FOR THE REST OF THE JOURNEY
I TRUST YOU WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO HONOUR US SO EARLY WITH YOUR COMPANY
HE GROWLED AND TRIED TO LOOK SULKY AND THEN WE ALL TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE TABLE IN OBEDIENCE TO THE THRICE-REPEATED SUMMONS OF ROSE
NO FIEND COULD TORTURE ME LIKE THIS I WON'T I WON'T SAID I GENTLY LAYING MY HAND ON HERS
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A TETE-A-TETE
IN ASCENDING TO MY ROOM I WAS MET UPON THE STAIRS BY A SMART PRETTY GIRL OF NINETEEN WITH A TIDY DUMPY FIGURE A ROUND FACE BRIGHT BLOOMING CHEEKS GLOSSY CLUSTERING CURLS AND LITTLE MERRY BROWN EYES
BUT I KNOW THAT SUCH CHARACTERS DO EXIST AND IF I HAVE WARNED ONE RASH YOUTH FROM FOLLOWING IN THEIR STEPS OR PREVENTED ONE THOUGHTLESS GIRL FROM FALLING INTO THE VERY NATURAL ERROR OF MY HEROINE THE BOOK HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN IN VAIN
HAPPY I REPEATED ALMOST PROVOKED AT SUCH A QUESTION
AND GLANCING UP AT THE MOON MADE SOME REMARK UPON THE BEAUTY OF THE EVENING WHICH I DID NOT ANSWER AS BEING IRRELEVANT TO THE SUBJECT
CHAPTER III TWO DAYS AFTER MRS GRAHAM CALLED AT LINDEN-CAR CONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATION OF ROSE WHO ENTERTAINED AN IDEA THAT THE MYSTERIOUS OCCUPANT OF WILDFELL HALL WOULD WHOLLY DISREGARD THE COMMON OBSERVANCES OF CIVILIZED LIFE,--IN WHICH OPINION SHE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE WILSONS WHO TESTIFIED THAT NEITHER THEIR CALL NOR THE MILLWARDS HAD BEEN RETURNED AS YET
BUT AS YOU WOULD NOT WILLINGLY MARRY MISS WILSON IF IT WERE SO YOU WILL DO WELL TO BE CAUTIOUS TILL YOU HAVE PROVED IT TO BE OTHERWISE I NEVER TOLD YOU MARKHAM THAT I INTENDED TO MARRY MISS WILSON SAID HE PROUDLY
THE LARGE BARE ROOM WITH ITS GRIM OLD FURNITURE THE NARROW LATTICED WINDOWS REVEALING THE DULL GREY SKY ABOVE AND THE DESOLATE WILDERNESS BELOW WHERE THE DARK STONE WALLS AND IRON GATE THE RANK GROWTH OF GRASS AND WEEDS AND THE HARDY EVERGREENS OF PRETERNATURAL FORMS ALONE REMAINED TO TELL THAT THERE HAD BEEN ONCE A GARDEN,--AND THE BLEAK AND BARREN FIELDS BEYOND MIGHT HAVE STRUCK ME AS GLOOMY ENOUGH AT ANOTHER TIME
BUT I PROMISED TO BRING HIM SAFE BACK AFTER A TURN OR TWO UP AND DOWN THE MEADOW
FOR THIS I OWED MISS WILSON YET ANOTHER GRUDGE
WHY SO
BUT THE FIRST DAY HE WAS WEARY WITH HIS JOURNEY AND I WAS GLAD TO GET HIM BACK
SHE SEEMED AFRAID OF ME AND WOULD START IF I SUDDENLY APPROACHED HER
DISSATISFACTION BECAUSE I HAD NOT MADE IT HANDSOME ENOUGH
AND NOW ENOUGH HAS BEEN SAID BETWEEN US
AT THE SECOND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE RAISE HIS HAND AND HURRIEDLY PASS IT ACROSS HIS FACE
AND IT IS ALWAYS WELL TO LIVE WITH SUCH A CHANCE IN VIEW YES YES
AND EVEN ELIZA MILLWARD WAS SLILY GLANCING FROM THE CORNERS OF HER EYES TOWARDS THE OBJECT OF GENERAL ATTRACTION
I KNOW TOO THAT IN YOUR PRESENT NEGLECTED LONELY STATE YOU ARE AND MUST BE MISERABLE
OH VERY GOOD WAS THE REPLY
WHEN WILL SHE RETURN TO GRASSDALE WAS MY NEXT QUESTION
YOU SMILE MRS HUNTINGDON
I THEREFORE SAID I WOULD ONLY GO AND SPEAK TO THEM A MINUTE AND THEN COME BACK
BUT WHY ARE YOU SO LONG ABOUT IT
FROM LAUGHING AT THE PRETTY SIGHT WE BEGAN TO TALK OF THE CHILDREN'S FUTURE LIFE
SHE WILL BE A CHARMING PLAYMATE FOR MY LITTLE ARTHUR
CLEAR AS THE DAY I DON'T CARE WHAT HE SEES SAID I OR WHAT HE IMAGINES
BUT EVERY FEATURE WAS RADIANT WITH SMILES AND GLEAMING THROUGH THE MISTY WHITENESS OF HER VEIL WERE CLUSTERS OF GOLDEN RINGLETS
WITH ALL MY HEART
AND NOW THAT THE REVEREND MICHAEL MILLWARD HAS BEEN GATHERED TO HIS FATHERS FULL OF YEARS AND HONOURS THE REVEREND RICHARD WILSON HAS SUCCEEDED HIM TO THE VICARAGE OF LINDEN-HOPE GREATLY TO THE SATISFACTION OF ITS INHABITANTS WHO HAD SO LONG TRIED AND FULLY PROVED HIS MERITS AND THOSE OF HIS EXCELLENT AND WELL-LOVED PARTNER
DID I GRANT YOUR REQUEST
THEY SPY OUT EVERYTHING OH I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS!--AND SO THEY DARE TO TURN MY FRIENDSHIP INTO FOOD FOR FURTHER SCANDAL AGAINST HER!--THAT PROVES THE FALSEHOOD OF THEIR OTHER LIES AT ALL EVENTS IF ANY PROOF WERE WANTING.--MIND YOU CONTRADICT THEM ROSE WHENEVER YOU CAN BUT THEY DON'T SPEAK OPENLY TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS
RACHEL SHOULD BE MY ONLY CONFIDANTE--I THOUGHT I COULD PERSUADE HER INTO THE SCHEME
THERE WAS SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY CHILLY IN HER QUIET CALM CIVILITY
I DID NOT MENTION MY SUSPICIONS TO RACHEL
BUT I FEARED THERE WAS MORE OF CONSCIOUS POWER THAN TENDERNESS IN HIS DEMEANOUR AND I FELT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO EXTORT A CONFESSION OF ATTACHMENT FROM ME WHEN HE HAD MADE NO CORRESPONDENT AVOWAL HIMSELF AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO ANSWER
AND IF NOT YOU ARE VERY WRONG TO JEST ON SUCH A SUBJECT I STAND CORRECTED SAID HE CONCLUDING HIS LAUGH WITH A SORROWFUL SIGH
FOR HE WALKED CLOSE BESIDE HER AND SPOKE SO GENTLY THAT I COULD NOT CATCH THE WORDS
HE APOLOGIZED FOR HIS INTRUSION AND SAID HE WAS ONLY COME FOR A BOOK
BUT MARY LIKED CHILDREN AND FOND MAMMAS LIKE THOSE WHO CAN DULY APPRECIATE THEIR TREASURES
YET HE WAS A DECENT MAN ENOUGH IN THE MAIN I DARESAY
OTHERWISE SHE WAS UTTERLY INEXORABLE REGARDING IT AS PERFECT MADNESS FOR ME AND ARTHUR TO GO ALONE
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU SAID HE PULLING HER ON TO HIS KNEE LIKE A CHILD
I WOULD WAIT AND SEE IF SHE WOULD NOTICE ME WHICH OF COURSE SHE WOULD NOT UNLESS BY SOME KIND MESSAGE INTRUSTED TO HER BROTHER THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WOULD NOT DELIVER AND THEN DREADFUL THOUGHT
AND BESIDES WINTER IS SUCH A DREARY SEASON I THOUGHT SO TOO REPLIED SHE GRAVELY
THERE WAS A CERTAIN GRACEFUL EASE AND FREEDOM ABOUT ALL HE SAID AND DID THAT GAVE A SENSE OF REPOSE AND EXPANSION TO THE MIND AFTER SO MUCH CONSTRAINT AND FORMALITY AS I HAD BEEN DOOMED TO SUFFER
AND IS IT POSSIBLE MRS HUNTINGDON THAT YOU CAN REJOICE AT HIS RETURN HE EXCLAIMED ATTENTIVELY PERUSING MY FEATURES AGAIN
AND THEREFORE I SHALL LEAVE YOU TO FINISH YOUR WALK ALONE--FOR NOW I THINK OF IT I HAVE BUSINESS ELSEWHERE
YOU TELL ME YOU OWE NO ALLEGIANCE TO YOUR HUSBAND
THIS IS THE LAST DAY I SHALL BURDEN YOUR HOSPITALITY SAID SHE AS SHE SEATED HERSELF AT THE TABLE
THE TIME AND THE MANNER OF HIS ASKING HER APPEARED LIKE A GRATUITOUS INSULT TO ME
THERE IS A BED OF YOUNG VEGETABLES IN THAT CORNER AND HERE ARE SOME SNOWDROPS AND PRIMROSES ALREADY IN BLOOM--AND THERE TOO IS A YELLOW CROCUS JUST OPENING IN THE SUNSHINE BUT THEN HOW CAN YOU BEAR SUCH A SITUATION--YOUR NEAREST NEIGHBOURS TWO MILES DISTANT AND NOBODY LOOKING IN OR PASSING BY
BUT HE IMMEDIATELY TURNED HIS BACK TO ME AND FINISHED THE PERUSAL AT THE WINDOW
AND FROM THE INCESSANT WAGGING OF HER HEAD THE FREQUENT DISTORTIONS OF HER WRINKLED PHYSIOGNOMY AND THE WINKING AND MALICIOUS TWINKLE OF HER LITTLE UGLY EYES I JUDGED IT WAS SOME SPICY PIECE OF SCANDAL THAT ENGAGED HER POWERS
RATHER FRIGHTENED THAN CONSOLED BY THIS HE TURNED STRUGGLING FROM ME AND CRIED OUT ALOUD FOR HIS PAPA
BUSY REPEATED HE DERISIVELY
NEVER TELL ME THAT TALE--I KNOW BETTER CRIED HE
BUT SOME OF OUR MEMBERS PROTESTED AGAINST THIS CONDUCT
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD EVEN ALLOWED ME TO TAKE HIM SO MUCH AS HALF A FIELD'S LENGTH FROM HER SIDE
I CAN EXCUSE THANK YOU MR BOARHAM BUT I WON'T TRESPASS UPON YOUR GOODNESS
WHY WHAT FOR
THEY'RE GONE DOWN BY THE WATER
AND I FEAR THESE NERVOUS TERRORS WOULD SO ENTIRELY DISTURB MY DEVOTIONS THAT I SHOULD OBTAIN NO BENEFIT FROM THE ATTENDANCE
HIS APPEARANCE HIS DEMEANOUR AND CONVERSATION AND MY FEELINGS WITH REGARD TO HIM I SHALL NOT TROUBLE MYSELF TO DESCRIBE
AND DON'T DISTURB YOUR REST FOR ME
MY ELIZA WAS CHARMING BEYOND DESCRIPTION COQUETTISH WITHOUT AFFECTATION AND EVIDENTLY MORE DESIROUS TO ENGAGE MY ATTENTION THAN THAT OF ALL THE ROOM BESIDES
THUS REASONING I TROTTED AWAY TO THE TOWN WHERE I DULY TRANSACTED MY BUSINESS AND PERFORMED VARIOUS LITTLE COMMISSIONS FOR MY MOTHER AND ROSE WITH VERY LAUDABLE EXACTITUDE CONSIDERING THE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE
AND DON'T SAY A WORD AGAINST MR HATTERSLEY FOR I WANT TO THINK WELL OF HIM
THERE WAS NOTHING TO DISTURB MY JOY BUT THE FEAR OF DETECTION
NOW IN THE FIRST PLACE I SHOULD BE LOTH TO WAIT TILL TO-MORROW WHEN I HAVE THE MEANS OF APPEASING MY HUNGER ALREADY BEFORE ME
I WOULD THEN DEFER MY RAMBLE OR CONFINE MYSELF FOR THAT DAY TO THE PARK AND GARDENS OR IF THE PROPOSED EXCURSION WAS A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE SUCH AS A VISIT TO THE SICK OR AFFLICTED I WOULD TAKE RACHEL WITH ME AND THEN I WAS NEVER MOLESTED
BUT TO MY UNSPEAKABLE SHAME AND DISMAY ARTHUR TURNED FURIOUSLY AROUND UPON HIM AND SWORE AT HIM WITH SAVAGE COARSENESS
I'LL DO MY BEST TO AMUSE YOU SHE AND LORD LOWBOROUGH OCCUPIED THE APARTMENTS NEXT TO MINE
YOU KNOW NOT WHAT YOU SLIGHT HE PASSIONATELY MURMURED
BUT MY BRAIN WORKED SO I COULD NOT THINK OF SLEEPING
A SPEECH A SPEECH SHOUTED WE
HE TOOK IT CAREFULLY INTO HIS ARMS LOOKED UPON IT WITH AN ALMOST PATERNAL SMILE AND I HEARD HIM SAY AS I APPROACHED AND THIS TOO HE HAS FORSAKEN HE THEN TENDERLY KISSED IT AND RESTORED IT TO THE GRATIFIED NURSE
MY HEART CLINGS TO HIM MORE THAN EVER
THE GIG DID NOT OVERTAKE ME
I WALKED BACK TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF IT
I LONGED TO KNOW WHAT TO DESPISE AND WHAT TO ADMIRE IN HER
BUT MISS MILLWARD HAS THE ART OF CONCILIATING AND AMUSING CHILDREN I CARELESSLY ADDED IF SHE IS GOOD FOR NOTHING ELSE MISS MILLWARD HAS MANY ESTIMABLE QUALITIES WHICH SUCH AS YOU CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO PERCEIVE OR APPRECIATE
THUS SHE DID ME GOOD WITHOUT APPROACHING ME
AT LENGTH THE GRIM DARK PILE APPEARED BEFORE US
THE NEXT DAY WAS SATURDAY
HAVE YOU NEVER OBSERVED SAID ELIZA WHAT A STRIKING LIKENESS THERE IS BETWEEN THAT CHILD OF HERS AND AND WHOM DEMANDED MISS WILSON WITH AN AIR OF COLD BUT KEEN SEVERITY
AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE YOUR FRIENDSHIP THAN THE LOVE OF ANY OTHER WOMAN IN THE WORLD LITTLE COMFORTED BY THIS SHE CLASPED HER HANDS UPON HER KNEE AND GLANCING UPWARD SEEMED IN SILENT ANGUISH TO IMPLORE DIVINE ASSISTANCE
NOW GET ME ANOTHER GLASS OF THAT SLOP I COMPLIED
AND I KNEW IT WAS MY DUTY TO WATCH AND SCRUTINIZE TILL THOSE SUSPICIONS WERE EITHER SATISFACTORILY REMOVED OR CONFIRMED
SOME STIMULATING CORDIALS HE MUST HAVE BUT THEY SHOULD BE JUDICIOUSLY DILUTED AND SPARINGLY USED
HE ADORES HER STILL AND WOULD GO TO THE WORLD'S END TO PLEASE HER
AND MY LITTLE MASTER TOO GOD BLESS HIM BUT I'M YOUNG RACHEL
FOR THE VILLAGE IS ALL ALIVE ABOUT IT
AND HE HELD HIS BREATH AND LOOKED VERY BLANK TURNED WHITE ABOUT THE GILLS AND WENT AWAY WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
IT WAS EQUALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION TO SIT OR WANDER ABOUT MY ROOM COUNTING THE HOURS AND THE MINUTES BETWEEN ME AND THE APPOINTED TIME OF ACTION STRAINING MY EARS AND TREMBLING AT EVERY SOUND LEST SOMEONE SHOULD DISCOVER AND BETRAY US AFTER ALL
I WON'T I TELL YOU
MAKE HER LAUGH PAPA--SHE NEVER WILL HENCE WAS I OBLIGED TO STAY AMONG THESE HUMAN BRUTES WATCHING AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET MY CHILD AWAY FROM THEM INSTEAD OF LEAVING THEM IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REMOVAL OF THE CLOTH AS I SHOULD ALWAYS OTHERWISE HAVE DONE
THERE IS NOBODY'S OPINION SHE THINKS SO MUCH OF
AND YOU ARE YOUNG TOO HELEN I BOLDLY REPLIED
YOU PROMISED I SHOULD KNOW SOME TIME AND YOU SHALL KNOW SOME TIME--BUT NOT NOW--MY HEAD ACHES TERRIBLY SHE SAID PRESSING HER HAND TO HER FOREHEAD AND I MUST HAVE SOME REPOSE--AND SURELY I HAVE HAD MISERY ENOUGH TO-DAY SHE ADDED ALMOST WILDLY
BUT I THINK YOU CAN HARDLY BE SO IGNORANT AS YOU PRETEND--YOU MUST KNOW HER AS WELL AS I DO I THINK I DO PERHAPS A LITTLE BETTER
I DO WISH YOU'D TRY TO CHECK IT CHECK WHAT WHY YOUR STRANGE TEMPER
I SAID YOU WERE UNWORTHY OF MY CONFIDENCE OH VERY WELL REPLIED I MOVING TO THE DOOR
AND THE WESTERING SUN WAS GLEAMING REDLY ON THE OLD HALL AND FLAMING IN THE LATTICED WINDOWS AS I REACHED IT IMPARTING TO THE PLACE A CHEERFULNESS NOT ITS OWN
YES AND I WOULD SAY WITH MARY MILLWARD SENSIBLE GIRL AS SHE WAS THAT IF ALL THE PARISH AY OR ALL THE WORLD SHOULD DIN THESE HORRIBLE LIES IN MY EARS I WOULD NOT BELIEVE THEM FOR I KNEW HER BETTER THAN THEY
BUT I THINK SHE REGRETS HER MISCONDUCT FOR SHE HAS NEVER REPEATED IT SINCE AND OF LATE SHE HAS COMPORTED HERSELF WITH WONDERFUL PROPRIETY TOWARDS HIM TREATING HIM WITH MORE UNIFORM KINDNESS AND CONSIDERATION THAN EVER I HAVE OBSERVED HER TO DO BEFORE
IF YOU WILL ATTEND THE FUNERAL COME QUICKLY FOR I NEED HELP
HE PROVOKED ME AT TIMES INDEED BY HIS EVIDENT RELUCTANCE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT HIS SISTER THOUGH I DID NOT QUESTION THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS MOTIVES IN WISHING TO DISCOURAGE MY REMEMBRANCE OF HER
WHEN YOU TIRE OF YOUR SINFUL WAYS AND SHOW YOURSELF TRULY REPENTANT I WILL FORGIVE YOU AND PERHAPS TRY TO LOVE YOU AGAIN THOUGH THAT WILL BE HARD INDEED HUMPH
I'M SURE YOU MUST BE STARVED;--AND TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE BEEN ABOUT ALL DAY;--I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ABOUT I'VE BEEN BREAKING IN THE GREY COLT--NO EASY BUSINESS THAT--DIRECTING THE PLOUGHING OF THE LAST WHEAT STUBBLE--FOR THE PLOUGHBOY HAS NOT THE SENSE TO DIRECT HIMSELF--AND CARRYING OUT A PLAN FOR THE EXTENSIVE AND EFFICIENT DRAINING OF THE LOW MEADOWLANDS THAT'S MY BRAVE BOY!--AND FERGUS WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING BADGER-BAITING AND HERE HE PROCEEDED TO GIVE A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF HIS SPORT AND THE RESPECTIVE TRAITS OF PROWESS EVINCED BY THE BADGER AND THE DOGS
ANNABELLA GIVE ME A CANDLE SAID LOWBOROUGH WHOSE ANTAGONIST HAD NOW GOT HIM ROUND THE WAIST AND WAS ENDEAVOURING TO ROOT HIM FROM THE DOOR-POST TO WHICH HE MADLY CLUNG WITH ALL THE ENERGY OF DESPERATION
I'M SORRY I GAVE IT YOU
YOU SAW WITH REGRET THE SAD HABITS HE WAS CONTRACTING I KNOW
YOU CAN'T PRETEND YOU ARE RELUCTANT TO LAY DOWN YOUR WORK
NO SIR MASTER WENT YESTERDAY REPLIED HE LOOKING VERY ALERT
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF NEWS I HEARD THERE--I HAVE BEEN BURSTING WITH IT EVER SINCE
THEN LOOKING UP IN MY FACE WITH A HALF-SAD HALF-PLAYFUL SMILE SHE WHISPERED,--'YOU'RE SO STERN GILBERT I HANDED DOWN HER TEA WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE AND SAID NOTHING FOR I HAD NOTHING TO SAY
HELEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO WHEN I GET WELL HE ASKED THIS MORNING
AND MEANTIME REMEMBER YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO THE PROTECTION AND SUPPORT OF YOUR MOTHER AND BROTHER HOWEVER THEY MAY SEEM TO GRUDGE IT YOU ARE SO GRAVE MRS HUNTINGDON SAID ESTHER AFTER A PAUSE
THE PALETTE AND THE EASEL MY DARLING PLAYMATES ONCE MUST BE MY SOBER TOIL-FELLOWS NOW
NAY NAY HUNTINGDON SAID HE YOU'RE TOO HARD UPON HER
BUT AS I WAS SAYING MRS HUNTINGDON THEY HAVE NO HEAD AT ALL
THEREFORE THERE CAN BE NO IMPROPRIETY OR HARM IN IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU WISH TO KEEP IT WERE NOT THESE CHARACTERS WRITTEN BY HER HAND
BUT PEEPING THROUGH MY FRAGRANT SCREEN OF THE INTERWOVEN BRANCHES TO DISCOVER WHO THE INTRUDERS WERE FOR A MURMUR OF VOICES TOLD ME IT WAS MORE THAN ONE MY VEXATION INSTANTLY SUBSIDED AND FAR OTHER FEELINGS AGITATED MY STILL UNQUIET SOUL
FOR IF THE GENEROUS IDEAS OF YOUTH ARE TOO OFTEN OVER-CLOUDED BY THE SORDID VIEWS OF AFTER-LIFE THAT SCARCELY PROVES THEM TO BE FALSE WELL BUT IF YOU THINK HER IDEAS ARE WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE STRENGTHEN THEM WILL YOU
AND I ROSE AND LEFT THE TABLE AND THE GUESTS WITHOUT A WORD OF APOLOGY--I COULD ENDURE THEIR COMPANY NO LONGER
HOW BEAUTIFUL THOSE LITTLE CLUSTERS OF FOLIAGE LOOK WHERE THE SUN COMES THROUGH BEHIND THEM SAID SHE ON PURPOSE TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT
I AM A SLAVE--A PRISONER--BUT THAT IS NOTHING
PARDON MY LEVITY MRS HUNTINGDON MURMURED HE MORE SERIOUSLY AS HE RAISED HIS EYES TO MY FACE
NOW IF I HAD HAD MY WITS ABOUT ME LIKE ORDINARY MEN INSTEAD OF WITHIN ME LIKE A PHILOSOPHER I SHOULD NOT HAVE SPOILED THIS CUP OF TEA AND BEEN CONSTRAINED TO TROUBLE YOU FOR ANOTHER THAT IS THE SUGAR-BASIN MR GRIMSBY
AND WHY
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SULK FOR ANYBODY OUR SHORT DRIVE WAS NOW AT AN END
MY RESOLUTION IS FORMED MY PLAN CONCOCTED AND ALREADY PARTLY PUT IN EXECUTION
WHAT WOULD YOU MAKE OF ME?--AND THE CHILDREN TO BE SURE THAT WORRY HER TO DEATH BETWEEN THEM NO MR HATTERSLEY THE CHILDREN GIVE HER MORE PLEASURE THAN PAIN
BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN TILL I ROSE TO MAKE THE TEA AND THEN IT WAS ONLY TO SAY HE SHOULD NOT TAKE ANY
AND WE HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS EVER SINCE
BUT EVEN THIS CONSOLATION WAS EMBITTERED BY THE CONSTANTLY-RECURRING THOUGHT HOW SHALL I TEACH HIM HEREAFTER TO RESPECT HIS FATHER AND YET TO AVOID HIS EXAMPLE BUT I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD BROUGHT ALL THESE AFFLICTIONS IN A MANNER WILFULLY UPON MYSELF
HOW COULD I ENDURE TO THINK THAT THAT POOR TREMBLING SOUL WAS HURRIED AWAY TO EVERLASTING TORMENT
I'M WISHING YOU GOD-SPEED HATTERSLEY CRIED ARTHUR AND AIDING YOU WITH MY PRAYERS
I WRITE HIS LETTERS FOR HIM AND GET HIM EVERYTHING HE WANTS
BECAUSE I WISH TO MAKE THE BEST OF YOUR SOCIETY SINCE IT APPEARS THIS IS TO BE THE LAST NIGHT I AM TO ENJOY IT TILL HEAVEN KNOWS WHEN
HATTERSLEY WILL BE TOO BUSY BILLING AND COOING WITH HIS BRIDE TO HAVE MUCH TIME TO SPARE FOR GUNS AND DOGS AT PRESENT HE REPLIED
HE HAS HELD IT THUS FOR HOURS
IF IT WERE NOT FOR THEM YOU WELL KNOW I'D DEMOLISH YOU IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE AND GIVE YOUR BODY TO THE FOWLS OF HEAVEN AND THE LILIES OF THE FIELDS THEN PLANTING A CHAIR BY LADY LOWBOROUGH'S SIDE HE STATIONED HIMSELF IN IT AND BEGAN TO TALK TO HER WITH A MIXTURE OF ABSURDITY AND IMPUDENCE THAT SEEMED RATHER TO AMUSE THAN TO OFFEND HER
I HAD NOT HAD THE PORTRAIT IN MY HANDS TWO MINUTES BEFORE THE FAIR ARTIST RETURNED
NONE OF THEM CAN BENEFIT ME IF SHE CAN'T WAS THE ANSWER
HE STOOD AND GAZED AT ME IN ASTONISHMENT
AND BACKING FROM THE ROOM HE SHOUTED FAREWELL YE TEMPTERS AND VANISHED AMID SHOUTS OF LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
AND THEN A GLEAM OF MALICIOUS TRIUMPH LIT UP HIS COUNTENANCE
BUT HER EYES GLITTERED WILDLY AND HER FACE WAS DEADLY PALE
BUT I CUT SHORT HIS APPEAL AND REPULSED HIM SO DETERMINATELY SO DECIDEDLY AND WITH SUCH A MIXTURE OF SCORNFUL INDIGNATION TEMPERED WITH COOL DISPASSIONATE SORROW AND PITY FOR HIS BENIGHTED MIND THAT HE WITHDREW ASTONISHED MORTIFIED AND DISCOMFORTED
AND ALTOGETHER HE ASSURED ME THAT IT WOULD BE EXCESSIVELY TROUBLESOME INJURIOUS AND UNSAFE
BUT HER SPECULATIONS ON THE FUTURE ARE FULL OF BUOYANT HOPE
AND SHE SAYS YOU HAVE MORE SENSE THAN MAMMA THAT IS BECAUSE SHE IS SELF-WILLED AND MY OPINIONS MORE GENERALLY COINCIDE WITH HER OWN THAN YOUR MAMMA'S
ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE REMONSTRATED WITH HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN
IT HAS BROUGHT ME INTO THE SCRAPE AND WILL NOT HELP ME OUT OF IT
NOW TAKE YOUR TEA SAID SHE
I CANNOT SLEEP
AND PLEASE TO COMPARE HIM FOR A MOMENT WITH MR HUNTINGDON AND GOOD LOOKS APART WHICH CONTRIBUTE NOTHING TO THE MERIT OF THE MAN OR TO THE HAPPINESS OF MARRIED LIFE AND WHICH YOU HAVE SO OFTEN PROFESSED TO HOLD IN LIGHT ESTEEM TELL ME WHICH IS THE BETTER MAN I HAVE NO DOUBT MR HUNTINGDON IS A MUCH BETTER MAN THAN YOU THINK HIM
I WISHED MYSELF SAFE BACK OVER THE WALL
I LONG TO SEE MILICENT AND HER LITTLE GIRL TOO
THERE WAS LITTLE NEED TO DISGUISE HIS HAND FOR THE POOR FELLOW SEEMED TO HAVE CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN WRITING AT ALL SO AS TO BE LEGIBLE
AND THEN WE MUST PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO GIVE YOU A DECENT FORTUNE AS HE HAS ONLY ONE BESIDES YOURSELF TO CARE FOR;--AND IF YOU BEHAVE WELL WHO KNOWS BUT WHAT I MAY BE INDUCED TO REMEMBER YOU IN MY WILL CONTINUED HE PUTTING HIS FINGERS TO HIS NOSE WITH A KNOWING WINK
HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON
NOTHING BUT HEAVEN'S TRUTH
BUT I IMMEDIATELY TURNED BACK AND WALKED STEADILY HOMEWARD
IT IS SCARCELY THE PROVINCE OF AN AUTHOR TO REFUTE THE ARGUMENTS OF HIS CENSORS AND VINDICATE HIS OWN PRODUCTIONS
WHAT BUT AS IF SUDDENLY RECOLLECTING HER AUNT'S PRESENCE SHE CHECKED HERSELF AND TURNING TO THAT LADY CONTINUED--'WHY AUNT THIS MAN IS MY BROTHER'S CLOSE FRIEND AND WAS MY OWN INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE FOR A FEW SHORT MONTHS AT LEAST AND PROFESSED A GREAT ATTACHMENT TO MY BOY--AND WHEN HE PASSES THE HOUSE SO MANY SCORES OF MILES FROM HIS HOME HE DECLINES TO LOOK IN FOR FEAR OF INTRUDING MR MARKHAM IS OVER-MODEST OBSERVED MRS MAXWELL
BUT SMILES AND TEARS ARE SO ALIKE WITH ME THEY ARE NEITHER OF THEM CONFINED TO ANY PARTICULAR FEELINGS
PRINCIPLE IS THE FIRST THING AFTER ALL
BUT A TEAR WAS EVEN NOW IN HER EYE
AT FIRST I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE NOVELTY AND EXCITEMENT OF OUR LONDON LIFE
MY FORBEARANCE PLEASES HIM--TOUCHES HIM EVEN I AM INCLINED TO THINK
WITH MY DARLING CHILD IN MY ARMS ALMOST AS HAPPY AS MYSELF AND MY FAITHFUL FRIEND BESIDE ME
BUT I ONLY HALF BELIEVED HER
AND I WENT
AND BESIDE MY ABANDONED WRETCH OF A HUSBAND THE BASE MALIGNANT GRIMSBY AND THE FALSE VILLAIN HARGRAVE THIS BOORISH RUFFIAN COARSE AND BRUTAL AS HE WAS SHONE LIKE A GLOW-WORM IN THE DARK AMONG ITS FELLOW WORMS
HE DID THE SAME
ANY ONE BUT YOU WOULD SAY I HAD MADE IT TOO LONG ALREADY
THE UNNATURAL PARENT SEEMS DETERMINED TO MAKE HER DAUGHTER'S LIFE A BURDEN IF SHE WILL NOT YIELD TO HER DESIRES
RALPH HATTERSLEY'S LAST RESOURCE WAS TO SET HIS BACK AGAINST THE DOOR AND SWEAR I SHOULD FIND NO PASSAGE BUT THROUGH HIS BODY A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL ONE TOO HAPPILY HOWEVER THAT WAS NOT THE ONLY DOOR AND I EFFECTED MY ESCAPE BY THE SIDE ENTRANCE THROUGH THE BUTLER'S PANTRY TO THE INFINITE AMAZEMENT OF BENSON WHO WAS CLEANING THE PLATE MR HARGRAVE LAUGHED AND SO DID HIS COUSIN
I WOULD NOT SEND A POOR GIRL INTO THE WORLD UNARMED AGAINST HER FOES AND IGNORANT OF THE SNARES THAT BESET HER PATH
AND HARGRAVE WALKED AWAY
MR HUNTINGDON CAME SUDDENLY UPON ME
AND YOU WANT TO DEPRIVE ME OF MY WALK AND MY VISIT BESIDES
BUT THESE WERE NOT MY PROPERTY
AND THAT THEY INDUCED HIM TO REMAIN WEEK AFTER WEEK AND TO PLUNGE INTO ALL MANNER OF EXCESSES TO AVOID BEING LAUGHED AT FOR A WIFE-RIDDEN FOOL AND PERHAPS TO SHOW HOW FAR HE COULD VENTURE TO GO WITHOUT DANGER OF SHAKING THE FOND CREATURE'S DEVOTED ATTACHMENT
AMONG HIS LETTERS WAS ONE WHICH HE PERUSED WITH SYMPTOMS OF UNUSUAL GRATIFICATION AND THEN THREW IT ACROSS THE TABLE TO ME WITH THE ADMONITION THERE
AND HE ALWAYS SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING HIM FROM THE DINING-ROOM IN GOOD TIME AND IN TOLERABLY GOOD CONDITION
AND YOU I GUESS WILL BE OF THE SAME MIND SO NOT AT ALL UNCLE
THE SLIGHT EXTERNAL WOUND HALF HEALED HAD BROKEN OUT AFRESH
IT IS I THAT AM LESS PATIENT AND FORBEARING
HE WAS REDOLENT OF THE STABLES WHERE HE HAD BEEN REGALING HIMSELF WITH THE COMPANY OF HIS FELLOW-CREATURES THE HORSES EVER SINCE BREAKFAST
HOWEVER SHE ASSERTED IT WAS ONLY A BUSINESS CONCERN AND SO SHE DID NOT INTEND IT SHOULD TROUBLE HER
FOR IMPELLED BY SOME FIEND AT MY ELBOW I HAD SEIZED MY WHIP BY THE SMALL END AND--SWIFT AND SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING--BROUGHT THE OTHER DOWN UPON HIS HEAD
I HAVE NOT EVEN ASKED HIM WHAT HE HAS BEEN DOING
AND THEN HATTERSLEY IS CONFOUNDED AND KNOWS NOT WHAT TO SAY UNLESS IT BE A TIMID SUGGESTION THAT THE CLERGYMAN MIGHT BE SENT FOR
NO REPLIED THE LADY SADLY SMILING AS SHE STROKED THE WAVY LOCKS OF HER SON WHO WAS SEATED ON A LOW STOOL AT HER FEET
SHE HAS MONEY ENOUGH TO LIVE VERY COMFORTABLY IF SHE ONLY KNEW HOW TO USE IT JUDICIOUSLY AND HAD TAUGHT HER SON TO DO THE SAME
CHAPTER XXXIV EVENING.--BREAKFAST PASSED WELL OVER
YOU HELPED TO DECEIVE ME MY LORD I DID NOT HELP TO DECEIVE YOU THEN WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULD BE PAINFUL TO YOU
AND TELL THE HOUSEMAID SHE MAY KINDLE THE FIRE WITH THEM
ALARMING SYMPTOMS WERE THE IMMEDIATE RESULT OF THIS IMPRUDENCE AS SHE MILDLY TERMED IT--SYMPTOMS WHICH HAD RATHER INCREASED THAN DIMINISHED SINCE
I WAS IN THE SHRUBBERY THIS EVENING AND I SAW AND HEARD FOR MYSELF THIS WAS ENOUGH
AND I BADE RACHEL SEND THE BOY
HE WILL RUN INTO ALL KINDS OF MISCHIEF AND I SHALL BE THE CAUSE OF IT
I CONFESS I LOOKED WITH SOME INTEREST MYSELF TOWARDS THE OLD FAMILY PEW APPERTAINING TO WILDFELL HALL WHERE THE FADED CRIMSON CUSHIONS AND LINING HAD BEEN UNPRESSED AND UNRENEWED SO MANY YEARS AND THE GRIM ESCUTCHEONS WITH THEIR LUGUBRIOUS BORDERS OF RUSTY BLACK CLOTH FROWNED SO STERNLY FROM THE WALL ABOVE
HOWEVER I NESTLED UP IN A CORNER OF THE BOWER AND HOPED TO RETAIN POSSESSION OF IT SECURE ALIKE FROM OBSERVATION AND INTRUSION
AND SOMEBODY SELLS THEM FOR HER THERE AND SENDS US THE MONEY IN LOOKING ROUND UPON THE OTHER PIECES I REMARKED A PRETTY SKETCH OF LINDEN-HOPE FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL
SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE HAD LITTLE CAUSE TO COMPLAIN
NOR HAVE I SINCE WITNESSED ANY SYMPTOM OF PIQUE ON HIS PART OR RENEWED ATTEMPTS AT CONQUEST UPON HERS
MY VERY ENERGIES BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL MUST BE STRANGELY IMPAIRED OR I SHOULD NOT HAVE ACTED SO WEAKLY IN MANY RESPECTS AS I HAVE DONE
IT WAS A DULL GLOOMY MORNING
BUT NO GENEROUS MIND DELIGHTS TO OPPRESS THE WEAK BUT RATHER TO CHERISH AND PROTECT I DON'T OPPRESS HER
THOUGH MAMMA AFFIRMED YOU WOULD BE QUITE SHOCKED AT MY UNDUTIFUL CONDUCT
UPON WHICH HE SOLEMNLY SWORE HE DID AND NO MISTAKE
YOU MUST GO HOME HELEN
BOTH IT IS TRUE HAD MORE DELICATE FEATURES AND SMALLER BONES THAN COMMONLY FALL TO THE LOT OF INDIVIDUALS OF THE ROUGHER SEX AND LAWRENCE'S COMPLEXION WAS PALE AND CLEAR AND ARTHUR'S DELICATELY FAIR
IT WAS JUST ABOUT THAT TIME SHE WAS CALLED TO SUSTAIN ANOTHER BLOW IN THE DEATH OF HER UNCLE--A WORTHLESS OLD FELLOW ENOUGH IN HIMSELF I DARESAY BUT HE HAD ALWAYS SHOWN MORE KINDNESS AND AFFECTION TO HER THAN TO ANY OTHER CREATURE AND SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO REGARD HIM AS A PARENT
I TOLD MY MOTHER THAT URGENT BUSINESS WHICH ADMITTED NO DELAY BUT WHICH I COULD NOT THEN EXPLAIN CALLED ME AWAY
I ONLY ASK YOUR SILENCE ON ONE PARTICULAR POINT
AND YET HE LOOKED NO FOOL
AND WHAT MORE COULD EITHER OF US REQUIRE AND I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE MY EXIT BUT HE CALLED ME BACK
IT WILL BE COLD AGAIN YOU MAY GO SAID HE IF YOU'VE DONE
BUT HERE AGAIN I MUST DO MR HARGRAVE THE JUSTICE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I NEVER SAW HIM LAUGH AT THE CHILD'S MISDEMEANOURS NOR HEARD HIM UTTER A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT TO HIS ASPIRATIONS AFTER MANLY ACCOMPLISHMENTS
SHE LIKES ME ALL THE SAME WHATEVER I DO IMPOSSIBLE MR HATTERSLEY
MR GRIMSBY WAS SEATED NEAR THE DOOR
FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE TO PLEASE HIM I HAD TO VIOLATE MY CHERISHED PREDILECTIONS MY ALMOST ROOTED PRINCIPLES IN FAVOUR OF A PLAIN DARK SOBER STYLE OF DRESS--I MUST SPARKLE IN COSTLY JEWELS AND DECK MYSELF OUT LIKE A PAINTED BUTTERFLY JUST AS I HAD LONG SINCE DETERMINED I WOULD NEVER DO--AND THIS WAS NO TRIFLING SACRIFICE
HE WANTED ME TO COME IN
AT LAST I GOT HIM TO COME IN WITH ME TO THE CLUB ON CONDITION THAT I WOULD NOT TEMPT HIM TO DRINK
FOR TEARS PREVENTED ANY OTHER REPLY
SUDDENLY HE CALLED ME TO HIS SIDE WITH SUCH A STRANGE EXCITED MANNER THAT I FEARED HE WAS DELIRIOUS BUT HE WAS NOT
I WORSHIP YOU
AT THAT MOMENT MY AUNT OPENED WIDE THE DOOR AND STOOD BEFORE US CANDLE IN HAND IN SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED AMAZEMENT GAZING ALTERNATELY AT MR HUNTINGDON AND ME--FOR WE HAD BOTH STARTED UP AND NOW STOOD WIDE ENOUGH ASUNDER
BUT WE WILL TALK OF THAT TO-MORROW
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO WALTER MRS HUNTINGDON SAID SHE ONE MORNING WHEN I HAD CALLED AT THE GROVE AND HE HAD JUST LEFT THE ROOM AFTER EXCHANGING A FEW WORDS OF THE COLDEST CIVILITY
SHE HAS NOT HEARD OF MY ILLNESS THEN THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF I THINK NOT I'M GLAD OF THAT FOR I HAVE BEEN ALL THIS TIME TORMENTING MYSELF WITH THE FEAR THAT SOMEBODY WOULD TELL HER I WAS DYING OR DESPERATELY ILL AND SHE WOULD BE EITHER DISTRESSING HERSELF ON ACCOUNT OF HER INABILITY TO HEAR FROM ME OR DO ME ANY GOOD OR PERHAPS COMMITTING THE MADNESS OF COMING TO SEE ME
THE LITTLE ONE WAS HURT AND BEGAN TO CRY
GO TO THE DEVIL RESPONDED HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW
BUT SHALL WE ESCAPE IN SAFETY
THE MAJESTIC SWEEP THE UNDULATING SWELL AND FALL DISPLAYED TO FULL ADVANTAGE IN THAT ROBE OF DAZZLING PURITY STAINLESS AND PRINTLESS--SAVE ONE LONG WINDING TRACK LEFT BY THE TROOPING DEER--THE STATELY TIMBER-TREES WITH THEIR HEAVY-LADEN BRANCHES GLEAMING WHITE AGAINST THE DULL GREY SKY
THE VERY IDEA WAS INTOLERABLE
BUT COULD ANY ONE BE IN LOVE WITH ME?--THAT'S THE QUESTION
SOMETHING CALLED ME NEARER--NEARER STILL--AND WHY NOT PRAY
KNOWING AS I DID THAT LEAVING MYSELF ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION HOWEVER HELEN MIGHT FEEL INTERESTED IN HER HUSBAND'S WELFARE HOWEVER SHE MIGHT DEPLORE HIS FATE STILL WHILE HE LIVED SHE MUST BE MISERABLE
I SHALL BE EXPECTED TO RETURN THEIR CALLS BUT IF UPON INQUIRY I FIND THAT ANY OF THEM LIVE TOO FAR AWAY FOR ARTHUR TO ACCOMPANY ME THEY MUST EXPECT IN VAIN FOR A WHILE FOR I CANNOT BEAR TO LEAVE HIM UNLESS IT BE TO GO TO CHURCH AND I HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED THAT YET
THE ANSWER RETURNED WAS THAT MR LAWRENCE HOPED I WOULD BE SO GOOD AS TO LEAVE A MESSAGE OR A NOTE WITH THE SERVANT AS HE COULD ATTEND TO NO BUSINESS AT PRESENT
BUT SOON A MORE HUMANISED EXPRESSION DAWNED UPON HIS COUNTENANCE AND BEFORE I COULD WITHDRAW MY HAND HE PRESSED IT KINDLY WHILE A GLEAM OF GENUINE FEELING FLASHED FROM HIS EYES AS HE MURMURED GOD HELP US BOTH AMEN RESPONDED I
I SAT BESIDE HIM ALL NIGHT WITH MY HAND FAST LOOKED IN HIS WATCHING THE CHANGES OF HIS FEATURES AND LISTENING TO HIS FAILING BREATH
YOU CAN CLEAR THEM AWAY AFTERWARDS GLAD TO BE RELEASED BENSON EXPEDITIOUSLY SET OUT THE DESSERT AND WITHDREW
I MAY BE MISTAKEN--PERHAPS I WAS MISTAKEN BUT SHE ACCOMPANIED THE WORDS WITH A SLY GLANCE OF DERISION DIRECTED TO ME FROM THE CORNER OF HER DISINGENUOUS EYE
BUT I MUST BEWARE OF MY OWN WEAKNESS TOO FOR I NEVER KNEW TILL NOW HOW STRONG ARE A PARENT'S TEMPTATIONS TO SPOIL AN ONLY CHILD
WHATEVER SKILL OR KNOWLEDGE I ACQUIRE IS SOME DAY TO BE TURNED TO HIS ADVANTAGE OR AMUSEMENT
WELL SIR SAID HARGRAVE INTERROGATIVELY AND WITH THE AIR OF ONE PREPARED TO STAND ON THE DEFENSIVE
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT YOU WILL WELL MOTHER DO BE QUIET!--I HATE TO BE LECTURED!--I'M NOT GOING TO MARRY YET I TELL YOU
WHILE HE STOOD PATIENTLY BY LEANING ONE HAND ON THE BACK OF HER CHAIR AND TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF HER BOOK WITH THE OTHER
WELL GOOD-MORNING HE SMILINGLY OFFERED HIS HAND
THIS IS A SWEET BEWITCHING CREATURE BUT REMEMBER THE BRIGHTEST ATTRACTIONS TO THE LOVER TOO OFTEN PROVE THE HUSBAND'S GREATEST TORMENTS I ASSURE YOU MY CHOICE HAS NOT BEEN MADE WITHOUT MUCH REASONING AND REFLECTION
AND WHILE I SAT ON THE SOFA WITH HER ON MY KNEE AND ARTHUR SEATED BESIDE ME GENTLY PLAYING WITH HER SOFT FLAXEN HAIR LADY LOWBOROUGH COMPOSEDLY CAME AND PLACED HERSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD BE DELIVERED FROM HIS FATHER'S CORRUPTING INFLUENCE
AND THIS TIME I LET IT PASS
AND THEN NEXT SPRING HE WILL BE OFF AGAIN
THERE BEFORE THE FIRE-PLACE STOOD THE TALL GRACEFUL FIGURE WASTED WITH MANY SORROWS
HE SHALL MAKE UP FOR ALL PAST DELINQUENCIES AS SURE AS I'M A LIVING SOUL THERE FOLLOWED A DISGRACEFUL CONTEST
I SEE IN THEM HIS FATHER'S SPIRIT AND TEMPERAMENT AND I TREMBLE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES
BUT FINDING I DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN HIS JOY HE QUICKLY FLUNG IT FROM HIM AND BITTERLY CURSED MY COLDNESS AND INSENSIBILITY
I CAST THE MANUSCRIPT ON THE TABLE AND LOOKED IN HER FACE
THERE IS ONE MORE THING YOU CAN DO FOR ME AND THAT IS COME AND SEE ME NOW AND THEN--FOR YOU SEE I AM VERY LONELY HERE AND I PROMISE YOUR ENTRANCE SHALL NOT BE DISPUTED AGAIN I ENGAGED TO DO SO AND DEPARTED WITH A CORDIAL PRESSURE OF THE HAND
YOU SPOKE OF YOUR GUARDIANS JUST NOW HELEN BUT IS NOT YOUR FATHER STILL LIVING YES BUT I ALWAYS LOOK UPON MY UNCLE AND AUNT AS MY GUARDIANS FOR THEY ARE SO IN DEED THOUGH NOT IN NAME
AND YOU'LL GOT ENTANGLED IN HER SNARES BEFORE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE
THEY HAD DRIVEN ME DESPERATE BETWEEN THEM
SHE WILL SAVE ME BODY AND SOUL FROM DESTRUCTION
AND NOW MY EYES FEEL HEAVY AND MY FRAME EXHAUSTED
BUT I SHALL BE GLAD WHEN THEY ARE GONE FOR I HAVE SO LITTLE LOVE FOR ANNABELLA THAT IT IS QUITE A TASK TO BE CIVIL TO HER AND AS SHE IS THE ONLY WOMAN HERE BESIDES MYSELF WE ARE NECESSARILY THROWN SO MUCH TOGETHER
IF YOU HAVE NOT SUFFICIENT CONFIDENCE IN MY AFFECTION TO BELIEVE THIS LET ME ALONE MY DARLING ANGEL--MY OWN HELEN CRIED I NOW PASSIONATELY KISSING THE HAND I STILL RETAINED AND THROWING MY LEFT ARM AROUND HER YOU NEVER SHALL REPENT IF IT DEPEND ON ME ALONE
MRS GRAHAM WALKED ALL THE WAY TO THE CLIFFS
WHAT OBJECTION DO YOU FIND FIRSTLY HE IS AT LEAST FORTY YEARS OLD--CONSIDERABLY MORE I SHOULD THINK--AND I AM BUT EIGHTEEN
I AM AWARE OF NOTHING SIR--EXCEPT THAT HE DELAYS HIS COMING LONGER THAN I EXPECTED
I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER--THAT I KNOW OF THEN I THINK YOU'D BETTER LET THEM ALONE ARE YOU GOING TO MARRY JANE WILSON HE COLOURED AND PLAYED WITH THE MANE AGAIN BUT ANSWERED--'NO I THINK NOT THEN YOU HAD BETTER LET HER ALONE SHE WON'T LET ME ALONE HE MIGHT HAVE SAID
DID I REPLIED SHE LOOKING SERIOUSLY UP
IT DID NOT MUCH AFFECT THE WRITING OF AGNES GREY WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN 1846 AND REFLECTED THE MINOR PAINS AND DISCOMFORTS OF HER TEACHING EXPERIENCE BUT IT COMBINED WITH THE SPECTACLE OF BRANWELL'S INCREASING MORAL AND PHYSICAL DECAY TO PRODUCE THAT BITTER MANDATE OF CONSCIENCE UNDER WHICH SHE WROTE THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL HERS WAS NATURALLY A SENSITIVE RESERVED AND DEJECTED NATURE
THE FIRST GLIMPSE MADE ME START--BUT MY EYES WERE DARKENED WITH EXHAUSTION AND DESPAIR
THE LATTER REMAINED IN THE HALL BUSY WITH HIS RAMROD AND HIS GUN
I WAS STANDING WITH RACHEL BESIDE THE WATER AMUSING THE LAUGHING BABY IN HER ARMS WITH A TWIG OF WILLOW LADEN WITH GOLDEN CATKINS WHEN GREATLY TO MY SURPRISE HE ENTERED THE PARK MOUNTED ON HIS COSTLY BLACK HUNTER AND CROSSED OVER THE GRASS TO MEET ME
TO WHICH END I'LL GIVE YOU A SONG--SHALL I AUNT
ONE MOMENT I STOOD AND LOOKED INTO HER FACE THE NEXT I HELD HER TO MY HEART AND WE SEEMED TO GROW TOGETHER IN A CLOSE EMBRACE FROM WHICH NO PHYSICAL OR MENTAL FORCE COULD REND US
WILL YOU NEVER LEARN HE CONTINUED MORE BOLDLY THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM ME
BUT IF HE DID THERE IS NOTHING THERE TO ANGER HIM NOR IN ANY OF THE OTHERS
AND HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF FEVERISH EXCITEMENT AND SO BENT UPON THE IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION OF HIS WISH THAT I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO GRANT IT AT ONCE AS I SAW HE WOULD NOT REST TILL I DID
AND DON'T PINCH MY ARM SO
I SUPPOSE NOT WHERE IS HUNTINGDON LOOKING ROUND AGAIN
I POSTED THE LETTER ON MY WAY HOME MOST MANFULLY RESISTING THE TEMPTATION OF DROPPING IN A WORD FROM MYSELF AT THE SAME TIME
BUT I AM WELL ASSURED THAT HE LOVES ME MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD--AS I DO HIM EXACTLY SAID SHE WITH A NOD
JANE WILSON THINKS YOUR VISITS TO THE OLD HALL BUT ANOTHER PROOF OF HER DEPRAVITY CONFOUND JANE WILSON AND ELIZA MILLWARD IS QUITE GRIEVED ABOUT YOU I HOPE SHE IS BUT I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU WOULDN'T WHAT?--HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT I GO THERE THERE'S NOTHING HID FROM THEM
BUT FOR FIFTY--OR FIVE HUNDRED MEN THAT HAVE YIELDED TO TEMPTATION SHOW ME ONE THAT HAS HAD VIRTUE TO RESIST
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN MRS HUNTINGDON?--TELL ME--I MUST KNOW EXCLAIMED WITH INTENSE AND FEARFUL EAGERNESS
BY THAT MORNING'S POST I DESPATCHED A FEW HASTY LINES TO FREDERICK BESEECHING HIM TO PREPARE MY ASYLUM FOR MY IMMEDIATE RECEPTION
I HAVE NOT BEEN AN HOUR I'M SURE OH OF COURSE AN HOUR IS NOTHING TO YOU SO PLEASANTLY EMPLOYED
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN THIS SILENCE TO WHAT END SHOULD I HAVE DONE SO
I KNOW IT IS SO PERSISTED I
I KNOW YOU WILL WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE BEEN HUNGERING AND THIRSTING ALL DAY FOR THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE
BARROW KEENE OF DERBY
FOR WHENEVER SHE DID CONDESCEND TO CONVERSE I LIKED TO LISTEN
I WILL COMMEND MY CAUSE TO GOD AND THEN LIE DOWN AND GAIN AN HOUR OR TWO OF SLEEP
NO--AND I WOULD NOT
SO STRONG HAD BEEN THE TEMPTATION TO END HIS MISERABLE LIFE SO DETERMINED HIS RESOLUTION TO RESIST IT
I ALLOW SHE HAS SMALL CLAIMS TO PERFECTION
SHE TOOK UP AGAIN THE TASK OF LIFE AND LABOUR
HIS VERY FRIENDS ARE NOT HALF SO BAD AS YOU REPRESENT THEM
HE SAYS HE IS GLAD TO BE HOME AGAIN AND GOD KNOWS HOW GLAD I AM TO GET HIM BACK EVEN AS HE IS
AND IF THEIR ATTENTIONS PLEASED ME ONE MOMENT THEY PROVOKED ME THE NEXT BECAUSE THEY PUT ME OUT OF HUMOUR WITH MYSELF BY REVEALING MY VANITY AND MAKING ME FEAR I WAS BECOMING LIKE SOME OF THE LADIES I SO HEARTILY DESPISED
SHE MIGHT RECOVER FROM THESE HORRORS SO FAR AS TO BE RESTORED TO HER FORMER HEALTH HER TRANQUILLITY HER CHEERFULNESS EVEN--BUT NEVER TO THOSE FEELINGS WHICH WOULD APPEAR TO HER HENCEFORTH AS A FLEETING FANCY A VAIN ILLUSIVE DREAM
AND ON THE OTHER HAND LET ME HOPE THAT MY MORE EXPERIENCED YEARS AND GRAVER HABITS OF REFLECTION WILL BE NO DISPARAGEMENT IN YOUR EYES AS I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE THEM ALL CONDUCIVE TO YOUR HAPPINESS
AH HUNTINGDON SAID SHE REPROACHFULLY PAUSING WHERE I HAD STOOD WITH HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE--'IT WAS HERE YOU KISSED THAT WOMAN SHE LOOKED BACK INTO THE LEAFY SHADE
BUT IF SHE IS IT WILL BE ENTIRELY THE REWARD OF HER OWN GOODNESS OF HEART
IF YOU MUST STAY IT IS NEEDLESS TO WASTE YOUR TIME IN THE JOURNEY THERE AND BACK BUT HE DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF SENDING ME ALONE
HE IS PARTICULARLY GRIEVED AT ME BECAUSE FORSOOTH HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH YOU FROM HIS SISTER'S REPORTS AND MEANT TO HAVE MARRIED YOU HIMSELF AS SOON AS HE HAD SOWN HIS WILD OATS I'M VASTLY OBLIGED TO HIM OBSERVED I
RECOLLECTING MYSELF HOWEVER THE MINUTE AFTER I OFFERED TO RESTORE IT
MY HEART FAILED ME
I REGARDED MY TWO FAIR NEIGHBOURS WITH A FEELING OF ABHORRENCE AND LOATHING I SCARCELY ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL
BUT WAS THERE ANY HARM IN WISHING THAT AMONG THE MANY THOUSANDS WHOSE SOULS WOULD CERTAINLY BE REQUIRED OF THEM BEFORE THE YEAR WAS OVER THIS WRETCHED MORTAL MIGHT BE ONE
THE END PRINTED BY SPOTTISWOODE BALLENTYNE CO
I HAVE THE SENSE TO SEE THAT I'M NOT ALWAYS QUITE CORRECT BUT SOMETIMES I THINK THAT'S NO GREAT MATTER AS LONG AS I INJURE NOBODY BUT MYSELF IT IS A GREAT MATTER INTERRUPTED I BOTH TO YOURSELF AS YOU WILL HEREAFTER FIND TO YOUR COST AND TO ALL CONNECTED WITH YOU MOST ESPECIALLY YOUR WIFE
BUT I HAVE MORE THAN YOU WILL LIKE TO HEAR OR PERHAPS CAN READILY EXCUSE,--AND MORE THAN I CAN TELL YOU NOW
NO ONE CAN BE HAPPY IN ETERNAL SOLITUDE
NOW I WANT TO WARN YOU HELEN OF THESE THINGS AND TO EXHORT YOU TO BE WATCHFUL AND CIRCUMSPECT FROM THE VERY COMMENCEMENT OF YOUR CAREER AND NOT TO SUFFER YOUR HEART TO BE STOLEN FROM YOU BY THE FIRST FOOLISH OR UNPRINCIPLED PERSON THAT COVETS THE POSSESSION OF IT.--YOU KNOW MY DEAR YOU ARE ONLY JUST EIGHTEEN
IT WAS HARDLY FOUR O'CLOCK WHEN I GOT HOME BUT MY MOTHER GRAVELY ACCOSTED ME WITH--'OH GILBERT!--SUCH AN ACCIDENT
IF HE IS OFFENDED HE CAN BEST TELL YOU HIMSELF WHAT IT IS ABOUT I'LL ASK HIM CRIED THE GIDDY GIRL SPRINGING UP AND PUTTING HER HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW
IS MR LAWRENCE AT HOME I EAGERLY ASKED OF THE SERVANT THAT OPENED THE DOOR
SHE TOLD ME SO HERSELF
YOU KNOW I NEVER DRINK ANNABELLA REPLIED HE SERIOUSLY
TO PITY HIS FORLORN COMFORTLESS CONDITION UNALLEVIATED AS IT IS BY THE CONSOLATIONS OF INTELLECTUAL RESOURCES AND THE ANSWER OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE TOWARDS GOD
I CAN PERFORM THE TASK THAT IS BEFORE ME NOW AND GOD WILL GIVE ME STRENGTH TO DO WHATEVER HE REQUIRES HEREAFTER
BUT HIS WERE TOO UNPARDONABLE
IN RETURNING HOME I WAS TROUBLED WITH SUNDRY MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE UNFORTUNATE LAWRENCE
WON'T YOU FORGIVE ME HE SAID GENTLY TAKING MY HAND AND LOOKING UP WITH AN INNOCENT SMILE
SHE WAS BUSY WITH HER WORK AND I WAS RUNNING OVER THE COLUMNS OF A PAPER FROM WHICH I HAD EXTRACTED ALL THE PITH SOME TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE
I ALWAYS MAINTAIN THAT THERE'S NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH YOUR HOME-BREWED ALE I'M SURE I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SIR
I AM BUSY JUST NOW OH
IT IS WICKED TO SAY SUCH THINGS OF OTHERS NOT TO HAVE THEM SAID AGAINST YOU THEN IT'S PAPA THAT'S WICKED SAID HE RUEFULLY
AT LAST ON HER ASKING MY OPINION UPON SOME IMMATERIAL POINT OF DISCUSSION I ANSWERED,--'WHY DO YOU WISH TO TALK TO ME LADY LOWBOROUGH
HE IS BUT A LITTLE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS IF HALF SHE SAYS OF HIM IS TRUE
RUN AWAY DO DO YOU SEE MY DEATH AMONG THOSE TREES ARTHUR SAID I FOR HE WAS GAZING INTENTLY AT THE SHRUBS AS IF HE SAW IT COMING AND I WAS RELUCTANT TO LEAVE HIM IN MY NEW-FOUND HAPPINESS AND REVIVAL OF HOPE AND LOVE
NO HE OPENED THE NEWSPAPER AND BEGAN TO READ
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM I DID NOT UNDERSTAND BUT HE SEEMED SOBER ENOUGH
I CAME TO TELL YOU MY GOOD FORTUNE SHE CONTINUED REGARDLESS OF RACHEL'S PRESENCE
STEP THIS WAY IF YOU PLEASE I REPEATED IN SO DETERMINED A MANNER THAT HE COULD NOT OR DID NOT CHOOSE TO RESIST ITS AUTHORITY
WHO KNOWS
I CHECKED THE HALF-UTTERED INVECTIVE AND SCORNFULLY TURNED AWAY REGRETTING THAT I HAD GIVEN HIM SO MUCH AMUSEMENT
I WISH HER TO BE HAPPY
AND STILL I MADE OUR MEETINGS APPEAR THE RESULT OF ACCIDENT AS OFTEN AS I COULD--FOR I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL--AND ALTOGETHER I BEHAVED WITH SUCH EXCEEDING PROPRIETY THAT SHE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO REPROVE ME ONCE
BUT I CARED LITTLE FOR THAT
WHAT DO YOU WANT ARTHUR I SAID AT LENGTH
BUT THAT IS COLDLY SPOKEN
WHAT A SHAME IT IS SAID I AS I TOOK THE EMPTY GLASS FROM HIS HAND FOR A STRONG YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU TO REDUCE YOURSELF TO SUCH A STATE IF YOU KNEW ALL MY GIRL YOU'D SAY RATHER WHAT A WONDER IT IS YOU CAN BEAR IT SO WELL AS YOU DO I'VE LIVED MORE IN THESE FOUR MONTHS HELEN THAN YOU HAVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF YOUR EXISTENCE OR WILL TO THE END OF YOUR DAYS IF THEY NUMBERED A HUNDRED YEARS
HE HAD AN UNFORTUNATE TASTE FOR GAMBLING
I REALLY GAVE YOU CREDIT FOR HAVING MORE SENSE.--THE POOR CHILD WILL BE THE VERIEST MILKSOP THAT EVER WAS SOPPED
I FOLLOWED WHETHER WITH THE DIM IDEA OF PREVENTING MISCHIEF OR ONLY TO KNOW THE WORST I CAN HARDLY TELL
EVEN LORD LOWBOROUGH CAUGHT THE GENERAL CONTAGION
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER ANNABELLA WENT OUT WITH HER HUSBAND TO SHARE HIS MOONLIGHT RAMBLE FOR IT WAS A SPLENDID EVENING LIKE THE LAST
FOR WE SHALL HAVE OUR PONY-CARRIAGE WHICH WILL BE PLENTY LARGE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN LITTLE ARTHUR AND THREE LADIES TOGETHER WITH YOUR SKETCHING APPARATUS AND OUR PROVISIONS SO THE PROPOSAL WAS FINALLY ACCEDED TO
BUT IS IT THE MOST HONEST OR THE SAFEST
BUT I COULD SEE BY HER FLUSHED CHEEK AND KINDLING EYE THAT SHE WAS SERIOUSLY ANNOYED
OR THAT OF HAVING NO TEMPTATIONS TO RESIST?--IS HE A STRONG MAN THAT OVERCOMES GREAT OBSTACLES AND PERFORMS SURPRISING ACHIEVEMENTS THOUGH BY DINT OF GREAT MUSCULAR EXERTION AND AT THE RISK OF SOME SUBSEQUENT FATIGUE OR HE THAT SITS IN HIS CHAIR ALL DAY WITH NOTHING TO DO MORE LABORIOUS THAN STIRRING THE FIRE AND CARRYING HIS FOOD TO HIS MOUTH
IT WOULD KILL ME IT NEVER WILL VANISH SAID I DISTINCTLY FOR IT IS THE TRUTH THE TRUTH HE CRIED STARTING AS IF AN ASP HAD STUNG HIM
I'M SURE YOUR POOR DEAR FATHER WAS AS GOOD A HUSBAND AS EVER LIVED AND AFTER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OR SO WERE OVER I SHOULD AS SOON HAVE EXPECTED HIM TO FLY AS TO PUT HIMSELF OUT OF HIS WAY TO PLEASURE ME
SHE WAS TOLD IT WOULD ONLY BE A SMALL PARTY AND ALL FRIENDS AND THAT THE BEST VIEW OF ALL WAS FROM
TO BE SURE I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR EVERY ONE WAS WILLING ENOUGH TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM AND HE HIMSELF WAS NO ACCOMPLISHED HYPOCRITE BUT I WAS WILFULLY BLIND
THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER FATE AND HIS MUST DARKEN HIS BLISS FOR A TIME
WHY SHOULD I STAY ANY LONGER WAIT TILL ARTHUR COMES AT LEAST ONLY TOO GLAD TO OBEY I STOOD AND LEANT AGAINST THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WINDOW
IT WAS WRITTEN AS A WARNING,'--SO SAID CHARLOTTE WHEN IN THE PATHETIC PREFACE OF 1850 SHE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO EXPLAIN TO THE PUBLIC HOW A CREATURE SO GENTLE AND SO GOOD AS ACTON BELL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN SUCH A BOOK AS WILDFELL HALL AND IN THE SECOND EDITION OF WILDFELL HALL WHICH APPEARED IN 1848 ANNE BRONTE HERSELF JUSTIFIED HER NOVEL IN A PREFACE WHICH IS REPRINTED IN THIS VOLUME FOR THE FIRST TIME
I CAN GO WITH YOU
R
BUT ON SEEING THAT HIS CARESSES WERE LIKELY TO PRODUCE TEARS AND LAMENTATIONS INSTEAD OF A RECIPROCATION OF FRIENDLY DEMONSTRATIONS HE PRUDENTLY DREW BACK
I SEE NOTHING TO LAUGH AT I'M LAUGHING AT YOU JUST NOW LOVE SAID HE REDOUBLING HIS MACHINATIONS
AND THEN I SAW THE ETERNAL STARS TWINKLING DOWN UPON ME
HE HAS NO IDEA OF SUCH A THING AND IT WOULD OFFEND HIM GREATLY
BUT ARTHUR WAS ASLEEP IN RACHEL'S LAP AND BETWEEN US WE MANAGED PRETTY WELL TO SHIELD HIM FROM THE COLD NIGHT AIR
HE UTTERED A LOW WHISTLE AND SAUNTERED AWAY TO THE WINDOW WHERE HE STOOD FOR SOME MINUTES LOOKING OUT UPON THE PLEASING PROSPECT OF SULLEN GREY CLOUDS STREAMING RAIN SOAKING LAWN AND DRIPPING LEAFLESS TREES AND MUTTERING EXECRATIONS ON THE WEATHER AND THEN SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST
I SEE THAT SHE WAS ACTUATED BY THE BEST AND NOBLEST MOTIVES IN WHAT SHE HAS DONE
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT I FOUND HIM VERY TROUBLESOME AND VERY HARD TO CONVINCE THAT I REALLY MEANT WHAT I SAID AND REALLY WAS SO OBSTINATE AND BLIND TO MY OWN INTERESTS THAT THERE WAS NO SHADOW OF A CHANCE THAT EITHER HE OR MY AUNT WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO OVERCOME MY OBJECTIONS
YES REPLIED HE SLIGHTLY AVERTING HIS FACE
MY MOTHER WON'T LET ME GO TO SEA OR ENTER THE ARMY
I LIKED THE MAN WELL ENOUGH BUT HE WAS TOO COLD AND SHY AND SELF-CONTAINED TO OBTAIN MY CORDIAL SYMPATHIES
DON'T YOU SEE WHAT A SOBER TEMPERATE MAN HE IS BECOME
AT ANOTHER IT WILL ONLY PLUNGE HIM INTO DEEPER MELANCHOLY THAN BEFORE
HIS TEETH CLENCHED
YOU WOULD THEN SEE CAUSE TO REPENT SUCH CONDUCT AS THIS NOT AT ALL MY DEAR
WHAT THEN OH NOTHING REPLIED HE
MAYN'T I ENJOY MYSELF AT ALL YES MY DEAR BOY BUT NOT IN THAT WAY
YOU SEE I'M A BETTER MAN THAN YOU THINK ME
WE HAD ALREADY STOOD LONG ENOUGH TO EXCITE THE WONDER OF THE VILLAGE SIGHT-SEERS AND PERHAPS THE WRATH OF THE ATTENDANT BRIDAL PARTY
BUT DROPPING THE SUBJECT OF AFFECTION SHOULD YOU WISH TO BE THE TYRANT OF HER LIFE--TO TAKE AWAY ALL THE SUNSHINE FROM HER EXISTENCE AND MAKE HER THOROUGHLY MISERABLE OF COURSE NOT
WHAT A NOBLE FIGURE SHE HAS
MEANTIME HATTERSLEY HAD SEIZED HARGRAVE BY THE ARM AND WAS WHISPERING SOMETHING IN HIS EAR--SOME COARSE JOKE NO DOUBT FOR THE LATTER NEITHER LAUGHED NOR SPOKE IN ANSWER BUT TURNING FROM HIM WITH A SLIGHT CURL OF THE LIP DISENGAGED HIMSELF AND WENT TO HIS MOTHER WHO WAS TELLING LORD LOWBOROUGH HOW MANY REASONS SHE HAD TO BE PROUD OF HER SON
YOU ARE TROUBLESOME TO MR MARKHAM
I VALUE HER SO HIGHLY THAT ANY ONE AMONG YOU THAT CAN FANCY HER MAY HAVE HER AND WELCOME
NOTHING CAN EXCUSE IT
AND SHE WILL RECOVER HER SPIRITS IN A WHILE I HAVE NO DOUBT--BUT SO MANY TRIALS HAVE BEEN ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR HER
IT IS ONLY OF A PIECE WITH THE REST OF HIS CONDUCT OBSERVED MR HARGRAVE THOUGHTFULLY REGARDING ME AND READING I SUPPOSE MY FEELINGS IN MY FACE
IF I HAD KNOWN SAID I THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HONOURED ME BY REMEMBERING ME AS AN INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE I MOST LIKELY SHOULD NOT HAVE DENIED MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF CALLING UPON YOU BUT I THOUGHT YOU HAD FORGOTTEN ME LONG AGO YOU JUDGED OF OTHERS BY YOURSELF MUTTERED SHE WITHOUT RAISING HER EYES FROM THE BOOK BUT REDDENING AS SHE SPOKE AND HASTILY TURNING OVER A DOZEN LEAVES AT ONCE
HE SEEMED SCARCELY TO MERIT THE EULOGIUMS OF HIS MOTHER AND SISTER THOUGH HE CERTAINLY APPEARED MORE CONVERSABLE AND AGREEABLE THAN LORD LOWBOROUGH MORE CANDID AND HIGH-MINDED THAN MR GRIMSBY AND MORE POLISHED AND GENTLEMANLY THAN MR HATTERSLEY ARTHUR'S ONLY OTHER FRIEND WHOM HE JUDGED FIT TO INTRODUCE TO ME.--OH ARTHUR WHY WON'T YOU COME
THE PONY SURPRISED TO BE SO STRANGELY RELIEVED OF ITS BURDEN STARTED AND CAPERED AND KICKED A LITTLE AND THEN MADE USE OF ITS FREEDOM TO GO AND CROP THE GRASS OF THE HEDGE-BANK
SINCE YOU CAME I CONFESS I HAVE HAD BETTER ATTENDANCE THAN BEFORE FOR THESE WRETCHES NEGLECTED ME SHAMEFULLY AND ALL MY OLD FRIENDS SEEM TO HAVE FAIRLY FORSAKEN ME
I AM NO ANGEL AND MY CORRUPTION RISES AGAINST IT
AS HE STUDIED WITH HER FATHER SHE HAD SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM IN SPITE OF THE RETIRING HABITS OF BOTH AND I SUPPOSE THERE WAS A KIND OF FELLOW-FEELING ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM
I AM WITH HIM NOW WHILE I WRITE AND I FEAR MY OCCUPATION ANNOYS HIM
THE YOUNG LADIES HAD CEASED TO BE AFRAID OF HIM AND WERE BEGINNING TO THINK HIM QUITE INTERESTING
BUT INSTEAD OF THAT AS I SAT NEXT HIM I COULD NOT HELP SEEING THAT HE WAS MAKING A CARICATURE OF THE PREACHER GIVING TO THE RESPECTABLE PIOUS ELDERLY GENTLEMAN THE AIR AND ASPECT OF A MOST ABSURD OLD HYPOCRITE
IN THE SECOND THE BOOKS AND POEMS THAT SHE WROTE SERVE AS MATTER OF COMPARISON BY WHICH TO TEST THE GREATNESS OF HER TWO SISTERS
YOU MAY BY JOVE AND MY BLESSING INTO THE BARGAIN I--HEM--SOMEONE ASKED IF HE REALLY MEANT WHAT HE SAID
FOR I WAS AS DARING AND IMPETUOUS NOW AS I HAD BEEN BACKWARD AND CONSTRAINED BEFORE
HE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE SO BUT FOR THAT HATEFUL PICTURE
MRS WILSON WAS BUSY IN THE KITCHEN BUT THE ROOM WAS NOT EMPTY
HE MAY SEE FURTHER SOME TIME
I WISH THIS AVERSION TO BE SO DEEPLY GROUNDED IN HIS NATURE THAT NOTHING IN AFTER-LIFE MAY BE ABLE TO OVERCOME IT
BUT IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE NOW--YOU WON'T STAY MANY MINUTES YOU SAY AND ARTHUR IS GONE TO BED BUT I HAVE A FANCY FOR A FIRE NEVERTHELESS
YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU ARE REALLY SHE I DO
I SUPPOSE IT IS WITH SLEEPING AND EATING SO LITTLE AND THINKING SO MUCH AND BEING SO CONTINUALLY OUT OF HUMOUR
BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT KIND OF BEAUTY AND I WONDER THAT YOU SHOULD WHY SO PRAY WELL YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S NOTHING NOBLE OR LOFTY IN HIS APPEARANCE IN FACT YOU WONDER THAT I CAN LIKE ANY ONE SO UNLIKE THE STILTED HEROES OF ROMANCE
AND THEN I HAD MY BROTHER HERE TO CHEER MY SOLITUDE WITH HIS OCCASIONAL VISITS
FOR THOUGH NOW CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIMSELF MISTAKEN IN HIS FORMER JUDGMENT HE STILL MAINTAINED THAT SHE HAD DONE WRONG TO LEAVE HER HUSBAND
FOR IT WAS DESTINED FOR THE SHELVES OF MRS GRAHAM
BUT I SNATCHED IT AWAY IN INDIGNATION--ALMOST IN DISGUST FOR HE WAS OBVIOUSLY AFFECTED WITH WINE
THE PAPER HE SET BEFORE HIM AND PRETENDED TO BE DEEPLY ABSORBED IN ITS CONTENTS DURING THE REMAINDER OF BREAKFAST AND A CONSIDERABLE TIME AFTER
I SHOULD KILL HIM BY INCHES
AND I DON'T AND I'M NOT GOING TO YOU HAVE DONE MORE TOWARDS IT THAN YOU SUPPOSE POOH POOH
IF SHE GIVES YOU HER HEART SAID I YOU MUST TAKE IT THANKFULLY AND USE IT WELL AND NOT PULL IT IN PIECES AND LAUGH IN HER FACE BECAUSE SHE CANNOT SNATCH IT AWAY HE NOW TURNED ROUND AND STOOD FACING ME WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER I CANNOT SAY THAT I LIKE HER MUCH
BUT FIRST LET US TAKE A PEEP INTO THE STUDIO AND PUTTING THE KEYS INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY
I WON'T BE DICTATED TO BY A WOMAN THOUGH SHE BE MY WIFE WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN
FOR ALL THE GOOD YOU EVER DID ME OR EVER WISHED TO DO I MOST SINCERELY THANK YOU
BUT THERE WAS NO VISIBLE EMOTION EITHER OF PLEASURE OR PAIN NO ATTEMPT AT PATHOS NO DISPLAY OF INJURED PRIDE
REFERRING FREQUENTLY TO HER BROTHER THE VICAR AND HER SISTER THE VICAR'S LADY BUT NEVER TO HER BROTHER THE FARMER AND HER SISTER THE FARMER'S WIFE
BUT OUR CONVERSATION WAS CHIEFLY ON THE SUBJECT OF HER INTENDED DEPARTURE WHICH I BEGGED HER TO DELAY TILL I WAS BETTER ABLE TO ASSIST HER IN HER SEARCH AFTER ANOTHER HOME BUT DID SHE SAY NO MORE ABOUT ME SHE DID NOT SAY MUCH ABOUT YOU MARKHAM
STAND FIRM AND YOUR MAMMA WILL SOON RELINQUISH HER PERSECUTION
I COULD NOT FORGET IT
AND MY APPEARANCE PREVENTED FURTHER DISCUSSION
GLADLY WOULD I HAVE LINGERED ROUND THE PLACE FOR HOURS IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING AT LEAST ONE DISTANT GLIMPSE OF HER BEFORE I WENT BUT IT MUST NOT BE--I MUST NOT SUFFER HER TO SEE ME
AND NEXT TIME I SAW HIM HE ACCOSTED ME IN ALL CONFIDENCE AS HIS AFFIANCED BRIDE AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO SETTLE MATTERS WITH MAMMA
THEY TELL QUEER THINGS ABOUT HIM DOWNSTAIRS
SHE IS THE MOST GENEROUS HIGH-MINDED BEING THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED OF
AT FIRST HE COULD DIMLY PERCEIVE HER FAULTS AND THEY GAVE HIM CONSIDERABLE UNEASINESS
SHE USUALLY SPENT MOST OF HER TIME AT STANINGLEY ONLY COMING TO GRASSDALE OCCASIONALLY WHEN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS OR THE INTEREST OF HER TENANTS AND DEPENDENTS REQUIRED HER PRESENCE
I HAD BEEN TO CALL UPON HER FATHER,--A SACRIFICE TO CIVILITY UNDERTAKEN ENTIRELY TO PLEASE MY MOTHER NOT MYSELF FOR I HATED TO GO NEAR THE HOUSE
WHY YOU CAN'T PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT IGNORANT OF WHAT DEMANDED I SO SHARPLY THAT SHE STARTED AND REPLIED OH HUSH
WHEN I PUT THE CASE TO MYSELF I OWN IT WAS WRONG I ANSWERED
I DO NOT ASK THE CAUSE YOU KNOW IT THEN AND YOU CAN BE SO CALM SAID HE SURVEYING ME WITH PROFOUND ASTONISHMENT NOT UNMINGLED WITH A KIND OF RESENTFUL BITTERNESS AS IT APPEARED TO ME
I KEPT UP MY ATTENTION ON THIS OCCASION AS LONG AS I COULD BUT WHEN MY POWERS WERE EXHAUSTED I STOLE AWAY TO SEEK A FEW MINUTES REPOSE IN THIS QUIET WALK
BUT I MUST RALLY ALL THE POWERS I HAVE REMAINING AND TRY TO TEAR HIM FROM MY HEART
YET BE IT UNDERSTOOD I SHALL NOT LIMIT MY AMBITION TO THIS--OR EVEN TO PRODUCING A PERFECT WORK OF ART
AND THEN SHE BROKE OUT INTO A LONG SHRILL LAUGH THAT PUT ME TO MY WIT'S END WITH FURY
LET US BE AS WE WERE REPLIED SHE FRANKLY PLACING HER HAND IN MINE
BUT INDEED I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY THE CHANGE FOR THE MORE YOU LOVED YOUR GOD THE MORE DEEP AND PURE AND TRUE WOULD BE YOUR LOVE TO ME AT THIS HE ONLY LAUGHED AND KISSED MY HAND CALLING ME A SWEET ENTHUSIAST
AND I DON'T AND WON'T COMPLAIN
HAD I DONE WRONG TO BLIGHT HER CHERISHED HOPES
THREE INCHES UPON MY WORD I WAS SEVEN LAST BIRTHDAY WAS THE PROUD REJOINDER
IT WAS A LITTLE CHILD SEATED ON THE GRASS WITH ITS LAP FULL OF FLOWERS
I COULD ENDURE IT FOR MYSELF BUT FOR MY SON IT MUST BE BORNE NO LONGER
BAY EXCURSION AND I HAD FOUND SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO MY COMPANY PROVIDED I CONFINED MY CONVERSATION TO THE DISCUSSION OF ABSTRACT MATTERS OR TOPICS OF COMMON INTEREST;--THE MOMENT I TOUCHED UPON THE SENTIMENTAL OR THE COMPLIMENTARY OR MADE THE SLIGHTEST APPROACH TO TENDERNESS IN WORD OR LOOK I WAS NOT ONLY PUNISHED BY AN IMMEDIATE CHANGE IN HER MANNER AT THE TIME BUT DOOMED TO FIND HER MORE COLD AND DISTANT IF NOT ENTIRELY INACCESSIBLE WHEN NEXT I SOUGHT HER COMPANY
HE WOULD NOT HAVE IT SAID THAT HE WAS SUCH A BRUTE HIS WIFE COULD NOT LIVE WITH HIM
SUCH AS I SHOULD GIVE TO ANY SERVANT-OF-ALL-WORK I MIGHT EMPLOY
HE'S A VERY TIGER IN HUMAN FORM
IT WILL BE NOTHING TO HIM NOR ME EITHER
MODERATION IN ALL THINGS REMEMBER
SHE IS A VERY ESTIMABLE PIOUS YOUNG PERSON SAID HE
HE IS PAST PRAYING FOR
I TOLD LADY LOWBOROUGH TWO WEEKS AGO THE VERY HOUR SHE CAME THAT I SHOULD CERTAINLY THINK IT MY DUTY TO INFORM YOU IF SHE CONTINUED TO DECEIVE YOU
HOUNDS
I WAS READY TO GREET HER QUITE AS AN OLD FRIEND
BUT I HAVE SOMETIMES FREQUENTED THE GAMING-HOUSES JUST TO WATCH THE ON-GOINGS OF THOSE MAD VOTARIES OF CHANCE--A VERY INTERESTING STUDY I ASSURE YOU HELEN AND SOMETIMES VERY DIVERTING
ONLY ONE OR TWO VESSELS WERE VISIBLE AND THOSE WERE FAR AWAY
BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE--BARELY POSSIBLE--THAT SOME ONE MIGHT HAVE BETRAYED HER AND SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY BY FORCE
AND THEN THERE IS THE GARDEN FOR HIM TO PLAY IN AND FOR ME TO WORK IN
OR PERHAPS HE WILL ONLY DISCOVER HIS MISTAKE WHEN HE HAS CEASED TO LOVE HER
YES NOBLE I MAY CALL THEM
SHE DID PERSISTED HE IN THE SAME GRAVE COLLECTED MANNER AS BEFORE
MEANWHILE RACHEL CAME IN TO KINDLE THE FIRE WHICH WAS SOON EFFECTED BY THRUSTING A RED-HOT POKER BETWEEN THE BARS OF THE GRATE WHERE THE FUEL WAS ALREADY DISPOSED FOR IGNITION
AND IMMEDIATELY HE RELEASED ME--AND IT WAS WELL HE DID FOR I WAS REALLY IN A PASSION
THE THOUGHTS OF LIVING ON YEAR AFTER YEAR AT THE GROVE--A HANGER-ON UPON MAMMA AND WALTER A MERE CUMBERER OF THE GROUND NOW THAT I KNOW IN WHAT LIGHT THEY WOULD REGARD IT IS PERFECTLY INTOLERABLE
MY DEAR I AM NOT ANGRY SHE REPLIED
NOT NOW--OF COURSE IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED--BUT WOULD SHE WHEN THIS SHOCK WAS OVER
AND THE POOR SUFFERER'S HORROR OF DEATH WAS STILL MORE DISTRESSING THAN HIS IMPATIENCE OF BODILY PAIN
BUT HERE IS ANOTHER FOR YOU INSTEAD OF TAKING IT QUIETLY I LIKEWISE TOOK THE HAND THAT OFFERED IT AND LOOKED INTO HER FACE
HE IS SO DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE TO WHAT I IMAGINED MY HUSBAND SHOULD BE
STOP RICHARD THERE WAS SUCH EVIDENCE OF JOYOUS THOUGH SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT IN THE UTTERANCE OF THOSE FEW WORDS--ESPECIALLY THAT TREMULOUS OH AUNT'--THAT IT THREW ME ALMOST OFF MY GUARD
THE FACT IS I BELIEVE WE WERE BOTH OF US A LITTLE TOO TOUCHY
BUT I DID NOT LIKE TO GIVE HIM A FLAT REFUSAL FOR FEAR MAMMA SHOULD BE GRIEVED AND ANGRY FOR I KNEW SHE WISHED ME TO MARRY HIM AND I WANTED TO TALK TO HER FIRST ABOUT IT
HOW MANY OF MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ARE GLOOMILY CLOISTERED WITHIN MY OWN MIND
I WAS BURNING WITH ANGER
SHE'S BUSY READING NO I WON'T CRIED ANNABELLA SUDDENLY LOOKING UP AND THROWING HER BOOK ON THE TABLE
I MUST HAVE RECOURSE TO MY DIARY AGAIN
I WOULD WAIT TILL TO-MORROW
CURSE ME HE MUTTERED PAR PARENTHESE IF I DON'T HAVE VENGEANCE FOR THIS
I'D NEVER STOP HERE I WON'T I TELL YOU SHOUTED HE
MAMMA WILL WEARY ALL ABOUT HER BEFORE SHE TIRES HERSELF WITH HER EXERTIONS
NOT THAT THERE IS THE SLIGHTEST NECESSITY FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND BUT IT PLEASES ME TO DO SO
HATE HIM HELEN
I THOUGHT THIS INTERVIEW WAS NECESSARY--AT LEAST I PERSUADED MYSELF IT WAS SO--THAT WE MIGHT SEVERALLY ASK AND RECEIVE EACH OTHER'S PARDON FOR THE PAST
AND SHOULD SHE SUCCEED IN BRINGING BOTH TO HER FEET THE FASCINATING COMMONER WILL HAVE BUT LITTLE CHANCE AGAINST THE LORDLY PEER
IN HER BEHAVIOUR SHE WAS RESPECTFUL AND COMPLAISANT EVEN TO SERVILITY
HE WITH HIS USUAL SELF-DEPRECIATION THOUGHT HER A WORLD TOO GOOD FOR HIM AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT THE KINDNESS OF PROVIDENCE IN CONFERRING SUCH A GIFT UPON HIM AND EVEN AT HER TASTE IN PREFERRING HIM TO OTHER MEN HE DID HIS BEST TO RECIPROCATE THE GOOD SHE DID HIM AND SO FAR SUCCEEDED THAT SHE WAS AND I BELIEVE STILL IS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST AND FONDEST WIVES IN ENGLAND
I SHALL NEVER TROUBLE YOU AGAIN BY INTRUDING MY COMPANY UPON YOU SO UNSEASONABLY HE LEFT THE ROOM
AND FOR SOME TIME SKETCHED AWAY IN SILENCE
TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE GOING AND WHAT YOU MEAN TO DO--AT ONCE AND DISTINCTLY WILL YOU TAKE YOUR HAND OFF THE BRIDLE SAID HE QUIETLY--'YOU'RE HURTING MY PONY'S MOUTH YOU AND YOUR PONY BE WHAT MAKES YOU SO COARSE AND BRUTAL MARKHAM
HOW WIDELY DIFFERENT HAD BEEN MY FEELINGS IN PAINTING THAT PORTRAIT TO WHAT THEY NOW WERE IN LOOKING UPON IT
SHE KNEW I MIGHT BE TRUSTED
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND MILICENT IS LIKELY BEFORE LONG TO FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLE AND TAKE UPON HER THE YOKE OF MATRIMONY IN CONJUNCTION WITH A FRIEND OF MINE
NO SAID SHE YOU MUST ASK MISS WILSON
I DID THIS MYSELF HOWEVER AS IN DUTY BOUND
AND BELIEVE ME I HAVE COME TO THE RIGHT CONCLUSION AT LAST
HE HAD OBLIGED HIMSELF TO TREAT HER WITH PATERNAL KINDNESS
BUT THEN I SUPPOSE IT IS TIME TO BE MAKING MY CHOICE AND IF I WAITED FOR SOME ONE CAPABLE OF ELICITING MY ESTEEM AND AFFECTION I SHOULD HAVE TO PASS MY LIFE IN SINGLE BLESSEDNESS FOR I DETEST YOU ALL HA HA
DEAR ARTHUR
MY MOTHER SAT OPPOSITE AN AWE-STRUCK BUT ADMIRING AUDITOR
THEN SAID I I'LL TALK TO ARTHUR TILL YOU'VE DONE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A RIDE MR MARKHAM IF MAMMA WILL LET ME SAID THE CHILD
HE HAS DISSIPATED HIS FORTUNE IN GAMBLING AND OTHER THINGS AND IS NOW SEEKING AN HEIRESS TO RETRIEVE IT
I REFUTED THEM TO THE BEST OF MY POWER
HE ACCOSTED ME BY NAME FOR IT WAS NO STRANGER--IT WAS MR LAWRENCE
IT WAS MR HARGRAVE
BUT NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN ON THAT OR ANY OTHER SUBJECT TO ME
NAY NAY I SUSPECT NOBODY
BUT TO OUR SURPRISE THE PLACE REMAINED VACANT
NO PUBLIC INTERESTS NO AMBITIOUS PROJECTS OR ACTIVE PURSUITS,--OR TIES OF FRIENDSHIP EVEN IF HE HAD HAD ANY FRIENDS COULD COMPENSATE TO HIM FOR THE ABSENCE OF DOMESTIC COMFORTS AND ENDEARMENTS
I DARED NOT LOOK AT HER BUT I FELT HER EYE WAS UPON ME AND FROM ONE HASTY FURTIVE GLANCE I THOUGHT HER CHEEK WAS SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND THAT HER FINGERS AS SHE PLAYED WITH HER WATCH-CHAIN WERE AGITATED WITH THAT RESTLESS TREMBLING MOTION WHICH BETOKENS HIGH EXCITEMENT
AND HAD IT ROLLED QUIETLY BY ME I SHOULD NOT HAVE REMEMBERED THE FACT OF ITS APPEARANCE AT ALL
BUT THEY ARE NOT COMING TILL ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH
THIS DISTURBS ME GREATLY
LET ME RATHER REFER TO WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MY AUNT AND ME AFTER BREAKFAST WHEN MR HUNTINGDON CALLED MY UNCLE ASIDE NO DOUBT TO MAKE HIS PROPOSALS AND SHE BECKONED ME INTO ANOTHER ROOM WHERE SHE ONCE MORE COMMENCED A SOLEMN REMONSTRANCE WHICH HOWEVER ENTIRELY FAILED TO CONVINCE ME THAT HER VIEW OF THE CASE WAS PREFERABLE TO MY OWN
FOR IF I BEGAN IT WOULD ONLY MINISTER TO HIS SELF-CONCEIT INCREASE HIS ARROGANCE AND QUITE DESTROY THE LESSON I WANTED TO GIVE HIM
I MUST CONFESS I DID NOT LIKE HIS CONDUCT DURING SERVICE AT ALL
AT LENGTH SHE PAUSED BEFORE THE EMPTY FIRE-PLACE AND TURNING TO ME SAID CALMLY--IF THAT MIGHT BE CALLED CALMNESS WHICH WAS SO EVIDENTLY THE RESULT OF A VIOLENT EFFORT,--'NOW GILBERT YOU MUST LEAVE ME--NOT THIS MOMENT BUT SOON--AND YOU MUST NEVER COME AGAIN NEVER AGAIN HELEN
I MEAN HOWEVER TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENT NEXT SUNDAY AND OBLIGE MYSELF TO LEAVE HIM IN CHARGE OF RACHEL FOR A FEW HOURS
BUT NO LETTERS CAN PASS BETWEEN US HERE SAID SHE WITHOUT GIVING FRESH FOOD FOR SCANDAL
HE SUFFERS DREADFULLY AND SO DO THOSE THAT WAIT UPON HIM
I THINK I WILL
AND HE ATTEMPTED TO EXTORT THE CONFESSION BY SHAKING HER AND REMORSELESSLY CRUSHING HER SLIGHT ARMS IN THE GRIPE OF HIS POWERFUL FINGERS
HER SISTER MARY WAS SEVERAL YEARS OLDER SEVERAL INCHES TALLER AND OF A LARGER COARSER BUILD--A PLAIN QUIET SENSIBLE GIRL WHO HAD PATIENTLY NURSED THEIR MOTHER THROUGH HER LAST LONG TEDIOUS ILLNESS AND BEEN THE HOUSEKEEPER AND FAMILY DRUDGE FROM THENCE TO THE PRESENT TIME
IT'S ALL FOR LOVE OR THE WORLD WELL LOST WITH ME
WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF A LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS THOUGH WE CAN'T RESPECT HIM BUT SHOULD YOU WISH YOURSELF TO BE LIKE HIM NO I'D RATHER BE LIKE MYSELF BAD AS I AM YOU CAN'T CONTINUE AS BAD AS YOU ARE WITHOUT GETTING WORSE AND MORE BRUTALISED EVERY DAY AND THEREFORE MORE LIKE HIM I COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE COMICAL HALF-ANGRY HALF-CONFOUNDED LOOK HE PUT ON AT THIS RATHER UNUSUAL MODE OF ADDRESS
HUNTINGDON YOU FOOL COME AND HELP ME CAN'T YOU CRIED HATTERSLEY HIMSELF SOMEWHAT WEAKENED BY HIS EXCESSES
OF COURSE I DID NOT LEAVE HIM TO PURSUE THIS OCCUPATION IN QUIET
NOT THAT I THINK IT OF ANY REAL SERVICE IN A PHYSICAL SENSE BUT BECAUSE I AM DETERMINED TO ENLIST ALL THE POWERS OF ASSOCIATION IN MY SERVICE
THE OTHER NIGHT WHILE I WAS WAITING ON HIM AND JUST AS I HAD BROUGHT HIM A DRAUGHT TO ASSUAGE HIS BURNING THIRST HE OBSERVED WITH A RETURN OF HIS FORMER SARCASTIC BITTERNESS YES YOU'RE MIGHTY ATTENTIVE NOW
AND MEANWHILE I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KEYS MY DEAR WHAT KEYS THE KEYS OF YOUR CABINET DESK DRAWERS AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
SHE HAD SHUT UP HER SKETCH-BOOK AND BEEN PROBABLY FOR SOME MINUTES IMPATIENTLY WAITING HIS RETURN
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO OFFEND YOU SAID SHE MORE PLAINTIVELY
I DON'T LIKE THAT WAY OF MOPING AND FRETTING IN SILENCE AND SAYING NOTHING
IF I COULD BUT BELIEVE THAT HEAVEN HAS DESIGNED ME FOR THIS
SURELY WE SHALL FIND NO LOWER DEPTH THAN THIS
AND WHEN HE IS NOT TO TRY TO MAKE HIM SO
THERE CAN BE NO ONE WATCHING
PLEADING HIS CAUSE WITH ALL THE BOLD YET ARTFUL ELOQUENCE HE COULD SUMMON TO HIS AID
IF THIS WAS THE CASE AND IF SHE SHOULD ONLY DISCOVER HER MISTAKE WHEN TOO LATE TO REPAIR IT--TO WHAT A LIFE OF MISERY AND VAIN REGRET MIGHT SHE BE DOOMED AS WELL AS ME
AND I TOOK HIM BY THE ARM AND LED HIM OUT
AND IN THE MORNING AFTER THEY WERE GONE A KEEN-BLADED CLASP-KNIFE WAS FOUND ON THE GRASS-PLOT BELOW
SHE HAUGHTILY ANSWERED SHE WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO ME BUT SHE BELIEVED SHE KNEW WHEN A MAN WAS SEEKING HER FOR HER FORTUNE AND WHEN FOR HERSELF
BUT I DID NOT LEAVE THE ROOM
I BELIEVE HE WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED THAT I DID NOT FEEL HIS OFFENSIVE SAYINGS MORE ACUTELY FOR WHEN HE HAD SAID ANYTHING PARTICULARLY WELL CALCULATED TO HURT MY FEELINGS HE WOULD STARE ME SEARCHINGLY IN THE FACE AND THEN GRUMBLE AGAINST MY MARBLE HEART OR MY BRUTAL INSENSIBILITY IF I HAD BITTERLY WEPT AND DEPLORED HIS LOST AFFECTION HE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE CONDESCENDED TO PITY ME AND TAKEN ME INTO FAVOUR FOR A WHILE JUST TO COMFORT HIS SOLITUDE AND CONSOLE HIM FOR THE ABSENCE OF HIS BELOVED ANNABELLA UNTIL HE COULD MEET HER AGAIN OR SOME MORE FITTING SUBSTITUTE
I SHALL NOT DISTURB HIM LONG SAID I
AND FROM THE CAUTIOUS PRIVACY OF THE COMMUNICATION I SUPPOSED SOME PERSON THEN PRESENT WAS THE LUCKLESS OBJECT OF HER CALUMNIES
I DON'T MUCH MIND IT NOW BUT IF IT BE ALWAYS SO WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE SERIOUS PART OF MYSELF
AND ACCORDINGLY I RECEIVED HIS CHEERFUL MORNING SALUTATION AS CALMLY AND COLDLY AS MY AUNT COULD HAVE WISHED AND DEFEATED WITH BRIEF ANSWERS HIS ONE OR TWO ATTEMPTS TO DRAW ME INTO CONVERSATION WHILE I COMPORTED MYSELF WITH UNUSUAL CHEERFULNESS AND COMPLAISANCE TOWARDS EVERY OTHER MEMBER OF THE PARTY ESPECIALLY ANNABELLA WILMOT AND EVEN HER UNCLE AND MR BOARHAM WERE TREATED WITH AN EXTRA AMOUNT OF CIVILITY ON THE OCCASION NOT FROM ANY MOTIVES OF COQUETRY BUT JUST TO SHOW HIM THAT MY PARTICULAR COOLNESS AND RESERVE AROSE FROM NO GENERAL ILL-HUMOUR OR DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS
THEN WINKING AT THE YOUNG LADY WITH A DOLEFUL SHAKE OF THE HEAD BE WHISPERED--'A MONOMANIA--BUT DON'T MENTION IT--ALL RIGHT BUT THAT I SHOULD BE SORRY TO INJURE ANY ONE'S FEELINGS RETURNED SHE SPEAKING BELOW HER BREATH
FOR A LONG TIME HE LAY SILENTLY LOOKING UPON ME FIRST WITH A VACANT STARE THEN WITH A FIXED GAZE OF STRANGE GROWING INTENSITY
HE GAVE ME A SEARCHING GLANCE AS WE PRESSED EACH OTHER'S HANDS AT PARTING
WE SAW NOTHING OF HIM FOR A WHOLE WEEK
THAT WORTHY STUDENT WAS NOW AT CAMBRIDGE WHERE HIS MOST EXEMPLARY CONDUCT AND HIS DILIGENT PERSEVERANCE IN THE PURSUIT OF LEARNING CARRIED HIM SAFELY THROUGH AND EVENTUALLY BROUGHT HIM WITH HARD-EARNED HONOURS AND AN UNTARNISHED REPUTATION TO THE CLOSE OF HIS COLLEGIATE CAREER
ALL WAS DARK AND STILL
I WAS NOT AWARE OF IT
FOR THEY HAVE ALL LOST SIGHT OF HER LONG YEARS AGO AND WOULD AS THOROUGHLY FORGET HER IF THEY COULD
BUT PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE IS NOW GONE BACK TO HIM AGAIN AND THAT A PERFECT RECONCILIATION HAS TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THEM
IS IT YOU SAID SHE TURNING AS I ENTERED
I SUSPECT SHE WAS WRONG THERE
I THOUGHT OF THAT TOO GILBERT BUT I FEARED TO MENTION IT BECAUSE I FEARED YOU WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND MY VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT
THAT I LOVE YOU WHOLLY AND ENTIRELY?--OR IF HE ADDED WITH A LURKING SMILE I EVER GIVE A THOUGHT TO ANOTHER YOU MAY WELL SPARE IT FOR THOSE FANCIES ARE HERE AND GONE LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING WHILE MY LOVE FOR YOU BURNS ON STEADILY AND FOR EVER LIKE THE SUN
HE IS A STRANGE BEING
IT'S AS MUCH AS MY LIFE IS WORTH TO COME WITHIN SIX YARDS OF HIM
IS IT TRUE?--AND IS IT WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE YES IF YOU DON'T OBJECT TO WALKING FOUR MILES--OR NEARLY SO--LITTLE SHORT OF EIGHT MILES THERE AND BACK--AND OVER A SOMEWHAT ROUGH FATIGUING ROAD IN WHAT DIRECTION DOES IT LIE I DESCRIBED THE SITUATION AS WELL AS I COULD AND WAS ENTERING UPON AN EXPLANATION OF THE VARIOUS ROADS LANES AND FIELDS TO BE TRAVERSED IN ORDER TO REACH IT THE GOINGS STRAIGHT ON AND TURNINGS TO THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT WHEN SHE CHECKED ME WITH OH STOP
I SPEAK THE SOLEMN TRUTH IN SAYING THAT I WOULD NOT EXCHANGE MY HUSBAND FOR ANY MAN ON EARTH IF I MIGHT DO IT BY THE PLUCKING OF THIS LEAF WELL I BELIEVE YOU
IT WAS HOWEVER WITH A GLOOMY SENSE OF THE DARKNESS OF THOSE PROSPECTS THE FALLACY OF THOSE HOPES AND THE VANITY OF THAT AFFECTION THAT I REFLECTED ON THOSE THINGS AS I REMOUNTED MY HORSE AND SLOWLY JOURNEYED HOMEWARDS
I CAN ILL AFFORD TO LEAVE ANYTHING BEHIND SINCE I HAVE NO MONEY EXCEPT A FEW GUINEAS IN MY PURSE
THERE WAS A CERTAIN INDIVIDUALITY IN THE FEATURES AND EXPRESSION THAT STAMPED IT AT ONCE A SUCCESSFUL LIKENESS
THIS IS DOUBLE SELFISHNESS DISPLAYED TO ME AND TO THE VICTIMS OF HIS FORMER LOVE
WHERE THEY DIFFERED IT WAS STILL HER UNCOMPROMISING BOLDNESS IN THE AVOWAL OR DEFENCE OF THAT DIFFERENCE HER EARNESTNESS AND KEENNESS THAT PIQUED MY FANCY
THERE IS STILL THE SAME FREEDOM FROM PAIN THE SAME DEADNESS TO ALL SENSATION WHERE THE SUFFERING WAS MOST ACUTE
AND YET YOU LOVE HIM AND SEEM TO BE HAPPY AND CONTENTED
AND EVEN MRS WILSON VOUCHSAFED TO REST HER TONGUE FOR A MOMENT AND LISTEN IN SILENCE WHILE SHE COMPLACENTLY SIPPED HER GIN-AND-WATER
GO IT LIKE BRICKS
BUT I SHALL SAY NO MORE AGAINST HER
MR HARGRAVE DID DEPART ON THE MORROW
I ROSE NEVERTHELESS AND WENT OUT
AND A MINUTE AFTER WAS HEARD SCREAMING IN FEARFUL AGONY IN THE GARDEN
THEIR SISTER JANE WAS A YOUNG LADY OF SOME TALENTS AND MORE AMBITION
I WANT HER TO HAVE TRUE NOTIONS VERY RIGHT
AND YET YOU WILL ALLOW THAT MOST OF US HAD BETTER ABSTAIN FROM IT EVEN IN MODERATION
YOU WANT ME TO GO I SUPPOSE I THINK YOU OUGHT
I SHALL PROBABLY BE LADY LOWBOROUGH SOME DAY AND THEN YOU KNOW DEAR I SHALL BE IN A CAPACITY TO INQUIRE DON'T YOU ENVY ME HENCEFORTH I SHALL ENVY NO ONE RETURNED I
NOW FOR THE TRIAL
ONLY A COLD GOT BY THE RAIN MY DOING TOO NEVER MIND THAT
BUT ESTHER HAD THE AUDACITY TO REFUSE THE NOBLE GIFTS
AND THEN HE BEGAN TO MUTTER BITTER CURSES AGAINST ME OR THE EVIL FORTUNE THAT HAD BROUGHT ME THERE
I SHALL SEE YOU AT MEAL-TIMES AND IN THE EVENINGS AT LEAST AND THAT WILL BE BETTER THAN BEING LEAGUES AWAY AND NEVER SEEING YOU AT ALL BUT MY LOVE I CANNOT LET YOU STAY
THE INSTANT HE BEGAN I SENT OUR SON OUT OF THE ROOM
I BOWED BUT VENTURED TO ASK HOW SHE KNEW ME
IF I GRATIFY IT IT MAY LEAD TO THE RUIN OF MY SON AND IF I AM TOO MYSTERIOUS IT WILL ONLY EXCITE THEIR SUSPICIONS INVITE CONJECTURE AND ROUSE THEM TO GREATER EXERTIONS--AND PERHAPS BE THE MEANS OF SPREADING MY FAME FROM PARISH TO PARISH TILL IT REACH THE EARS OF SOME ONE WHO WILL CARRY IT TO THE LORD OF GRASSDALE MANOR
BUT THIS TIME A TEAR FELL ON HIS FACE AND MADE HIM LOOK UP
AND THOUGH THE CHILD HAD BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WITH HER THERE AND TO HELP HER TO NURSE HIS PAPA AND THOUGH SHE HAD NO DOUBT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD AND QUIET SHE COULD NOT THINK OF SUBJECTING HIS YOUNG AND TENDER FEELINGS TO THE SIGHT OF SO MUCH SUFFERING OR OF ALLOWING HIM TO WITNESS HIS FATHER'S IMPATIENCE OR HEAR THE DREADFUL LANGUAGE HE WAS WONT TO USE IN HIS PAROXYSMS OF PAIN OR IRRITATION
AND I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU
I NEVER HEARD SUCH A THING BECAUSE I DO HOPE IT OR RATHER I WISH IT
AND MOREOVER IN THOSE DAYS WHENEVER HE CALLED UPON OUR PARENTS WE HAD TO STAND UP BEFORE HIM AND SAY OUR CATECHISM OR REPEAT HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE OR SOME OTHER HYMN OR--WORSE THAN ALL--BE QUESTIONED ABOUT HIS LAST TEXT AND THE HEADS OF THE DISCOURSE WHICH WE NEVER COULD REMEMBER
BUT LOOK AGAIN A FEW HOURS HENCE HERE THE GENTLEMAN TOOK A SEAT NEAR ME AT THE TABLE AND PETITIONED FOR A CUP OF COFFEE
BUT THIS WOULD NOT HAVE DETERRED ME FOR A MOMENT IF I COULD HAVE VENTURED TO BELIEVE THAT YOU EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM ME OR EVEN WASTED A THOUGHT UPON YOUR UNHAPPY FRIEND
WHY MR MARKHAM REPLIED SHE COOLLY HAVING QUICKLY RECOVERED HER SELF-POSSESSION IT SURPRISES ME RATHER THAT MRS MARKHAM SHOULD INVITE SUCH A PERSON AS MRS GRAHAM TO HER HOUSE
AND WHAT WILL YOU DO RACHEL SAID I
IN A WORD AS I TOLD YOU HE IS FAIRLY BESOTTED
INSTINCTIVELY I GUESSED WHO IT WAS AND ON LOOKING UP WAS LESS SURPRISED THAN DELIGHTED TO SEE MR HUNTINGDON SMILING UPON ME
FINDING HOWEVER THAT HE COULD NOT BE SILENCED BY REASON AND EVEN COVERTLY EXULTED IN HIS SEEMING ADVANTAGE AND VENTURED TO DERIDE THOSE ASSERTIONS I HAD NOT THE COOLNESS TO PROVE I CHANGED MY COURSE AND TRIED ANOTHER PLAN
LET THEM BE TOLERABLY DECENT THEN ARTHUR SAID I
JOHN JUST THEN ENTERED THE HALL AND SEEING ME TOLD ME HE HAD BEEN SENT IN SEARCH OF ME ADDING THAT HE HAD TAKEN IN THE TEA AND MASTER WISHED TO KNOW IF I WERE COMING
HE MIGHT WELL LOOK SMILINGLY DOWN UPON THOSE SMALL FAIR FEATURES RADIANT WITH INNOCENT MIRTH THOSE CLEAR BLUE SHINING EYES AND THAT SOFT FLAXEN HAIR CAST BACK UPON THE LITTLE IVORY NECK AND SHOULDERS
AND NONE BUT MYSELF SHALL KNOW HOW BITTER I FIND IT
HE SHOULD LEARN TO BE ASHAMED OF IT MRS MARKHAM I BEG YOU WILL NOT SAY SUCH THINGS IN HIS PRESENCE AT LEAST
AND THEY SHALL CHEER AND COMFORT ME
IT NEEDS CONSIDERATION THEN
NOW PERSISTED HE
I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE YIELDED AT ONCE IF I HAD KNOWN FROM THE BEGINNING HOW MUCH RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE COST ME
WHAT'S TO DO WITH YOU HELEN SAID HE
AND I WILL TAKE YOU DOWN MYSELF TO GRASSDALE AND THEN RETURN
UPON WHICH HE SAID HE WOULD TRY
HENCE I LEARNED TO WELCOME MR HARGRAVE AS A REAL FRIEND TO THE FAMILY A HARMLESS COMPANION FOR ARTHUR TO CHEER HIS SPIRITS AND PRESERVE HIM FROM THE TEDIUM OF ABSOLUTE IDLENESS AND A TOTAL ISOLATION FROM ALL SOCIETY BUT MINE AND A USEFUL ALLY TO ME
I THOUGHT MR MILLWARD NEVER WOULD CEASE TELLING US THAT HE WAS NO TEA-DRINKER AND THAT IT WAS HIGHLY INJURIOUS TO KEEP LOADING THE STOMACH WITH SLOPS TO THE EXCLUSION OF MORE WHOLESOME SUSTENANCE AND SO GIVE HIMSELF TIME TO FINISH HIS FOURTH CUP
BUT WEARY AS I WAS MY EXCITED FEELINGS AND RESTLESS COGITATIONS KEPT ME AWAKE TILL DAWN BEGAN TO STRUGGLE WITH THE DARKNESS
WELL WELL
I GLADLY AVAILED MYSELF OF SUCH A RESPITE AND FOLLOWED HER INTO A LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL CONSERVATORY PLENTIFULLY FURNISHED WITH FLOWERS CONSIDERING THE SEASON--BUT OF COURSE I HAD LITTLE ATTENTION TO SPARE FOR THEM
I FEAR I HAVE FOUND IT MUCH EASIER TO REMEMBER HER ADVICE THAN TO PROFIT BY IT;--INDEED I HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN LED TO QUESTION THE SOUNDNESS OF HER DOCTRINES ON THOSE SUBJECTS
AND I SUPPOSE THE OLD MISSIS IS AGOING TO LEAVE AFTER THIS STIR'S GOTTEN OVERED AND TAKE HERSELF OFF SOMEWHERE TO LIVE ON HER BIT OF A JOINTURE
WELL GIVE ME MY FLESH AND BLOOD LOVER AND I'LL LEAVE ALL THE SIR HERBERTS AND VALENTINES TO YOU--IF YOU CAN FIND THEM I DON'T WANT THEM SAID SHE
ANNE HAS BEEN WRITING SOME ARTICLES ON THIS AND A BOOK BY HENRY SOPHONA
IF YOU KNEW HOW MY HEART THROBBED AND HOW EVERY NERVE THRILLED THROUGH ME WHILE YOU SPOKE YOU WOULD SPARE ME
COME NOW HELEN
NEVER DID I ENDURE SO LONG SO MISERABLE A NIGHT AS THAT
FINDING SUCH DISAGREEABLE CONSEQUENCES INVARIABLY TO RESULT FROM THIS INDULGENCE HE SOON GREW WEARY OF IT BUT THE MORE HE SHRANK FROM THE DAILY TREAT THE MORE I PRESSED IT UPON HIM TILL HIS RELUCTANCE WAS STRENGTHENED TO PERFECT ABHORRENCE
WE ARE TO BE PARTED FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS ABOVE TEN WEEKS
NONE CAN IMAGINE THE MISERIES BODILY AND MENTAL OF THAT DEATH-BED
ARTHUR HAS RETURNED TO NEARLY HIS FORMER CONDITION AND HABITS
BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT--AT LEAST I THOUGHT I COULD NOT THOUGH SOMETIMES I FELT A PANG OF REMORSE FOR MY UNDUTIFUL CONDUCT TO HER AND MADE AN EFFORT TO AMEND ATTENDED WITH SOME PARTIAL SUCCESS
I ABRUPTLY TURNED AWAY AND SNATCHING UP MY BRUSH BEGAN TO DASH AWAY AT MY CANVAS WITH RATHER TOO MUCH ENERGY FOR THE GOOD OF THE PICTURE
I HALF RUSHED HALF STAGGERED FROM THE SPOT WHERE HORROR HAD KEPT ME ROOTED AND LEAPED OR TUMBLED OVER THE WALL--I HARDLY KNOW WHICH--BUT I KNOW THAT AFTERWARDS LIKE A PASSIONATE CHILD I DASHED MYSELF ON THE GROUND AND LAY THERE IN A PAROXYSM OF ANGER AND DESPAIR--HOW LONG I CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO SAY
SHE'LL SING READILY ENOUGH SAID FERGUS IF YOU'LL UNDERTAKE TO STAND BY HER MR LAWRENCE AND TURN OVER THE LEAVES FOR HER I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO DO SO MISS WILSON
IT WAS NO WANT OF CONFIDENCE IN YOU
BY AN IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE I HELD OUT MY HAND AND THE WORDS LET ME SEE IT INVOLUNTARILY PASSED MY LIPS
NEAR THE TOP OF THIS HILL ABOUT TWO MILES FROM LINDEN-CAR STOOD WILDFELL HALL A SUPERANNUATED MANSION OF THE ELIZABETHAN ERA BUILT OF DARK GREY STONE VENERABLE AND PICTURESQUE TO LOOK AT BUT DOUBTLESS COLD AND GLOOMY ENOUGH TO INHABIT WITH ITS THICK STONE MULLIONS AND LITTLE LATTICED PANES ITS TIME-EATEN AIR-HOLES AND ITS TOO LONELY TOO UNSHELTERED SITUATION,--ONLY SHIELDED FROM THE WAR OF WIND AND WEATHER BY A GROUP OF SCOTCH FIRS THEMSELVES HALF BLIGHTED WITH STORMS AND LOOKING AS STERN AND GLOOMY AS THE HALL ITSELF
IT WAS LITTLE ARTHUR THAT ROUSED ME WITH HIS GENTLE KISSES
WHY CAN'T WE PART AT ONCE EXCLAIMED SHE ALMOST WILDLY AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE AS SHE SUDDENLY ROSE FROM HER CHAIR WITH HER HANDS RESOLUTELY CLASPED TOGETHER
THANK HER
BUT EVEN IF TROUBLE SHOULD FAIL TO KILL ME BEFORE VICE DESTROYS HIM THINK IF HE REACHED BUT FIFTY YEARS OR SO WOULD YOU WAIT TWENTY OR FIFTEEN--IN VAGUE UNCERTAINTY AND SUSPENSE--THROUGH ALL THE PRIME OF YOUTH AND MANHOOD--AND MARRY AT LAST A WOMAN FADED AND WORN AS I SHALL BE--WITHOUT EVER HAVING SEEN ME FROM THIS DAY TO THAT?--YOU WOULD NOT SHE CONTINUED INTERRUPTING MY EARNEST PROTESTATIONS OF UNFAILING CONSTANCY,--'OR IF YOU WOULD YOU SHOULD NOT
I HAD BUT A TRANSIENT GLIMPSE OF HIM
IT'S TIME ENOUGH TO BE CLUTCHING FOR MORE I THINK WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SEE THE END OF WHAT YOU HAVE
AND FOR THAT CAUSE AND TO LESSEN THE DANGER OF DISCOVERY I OWN I HAVE GENERALLY DISCOURAGED HIS INCLINATION TO TALK ABOUT YOU
LAWRENCE SAID I CALMLY LOOKING HIM IN THE FACE ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH MRS GRAHAM INSTEAD OF HIS BEING DEEPLY OFFENDED AT THIS AS I MORE THAN HALF EXPECTED HE WOULD THE FIRST START OF SURPRISE AT THE AUDACIOUS QUESTION WAS FOLLOWED BY A TITTERING LAUGH AS IF HE WAS HIGHLY AMUSED AT THE IDEA
FOR ALL I HAVE WILL BE HIS AND ALL HE HAS WILL BE MINE
HOW COULD YOU SAY SO TO HER CRIED RACHEL
AND WHY MRS HUNTINGDON?--WHY NOT HELEN AS BEFORE HELEN THEN--DEAR HELEN I MURMURED
AND WHEN I MARRY I SHALL EXPECT TO FIND MORE PLEASURE IN MAKING MY WIFE HAPPY AND COMFORTABLE THAN IN BEING MADE SO BY HER
IT WAS SIR HUMPHRY DAVY'S LAST DAYS OF A PHILOSOPHER AND ON THE FIRST LEAF WAS WRITTEN FREDERICK LAWRENCE I CLOSED THE BOOK BUT KEPT IT IN MY HAND AND STOOD FACING THE DOOR WITH MY BACK TO THE FIRE-PLACE CALMLY WAITING HER ARRIVAL
HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH WICKED THINGS
AND I'M DETERMINED TO DO NOTHING ELSE--EXCEPT MAKE MYSELF SUCH A NUISANCE TO YOU ALL THAT YOU WILL BE THANKFUL TO GET RID OF ME ON ANY TERMS OUR PARENT SOOTHINGLY STROKED HIS STIFF SHORT CURLS
MRS HUNTINGDON SAID HE WITH BITTER SOLEMNITY YOU ARE CRUEL--CRUEL TO ME--CRUEL TO YOURSELF MR HARGRAVE REMEMBER YOUR PROMISE I MUST SPEAK
BUT THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH FOR MR HUNTINGDON
BUT MY GOOD AUNT WAS TOUCHED AT MY AGITATION
THEN YOU MUST SEND FOR THEM SAID HE
AND PLAY THE FOOL OR THE MADMAN TO HIS OWN HEART'S DESIRE WITHOUT ANY FEAR OR BOTHERATION
I HAVE BEEN SILENT LONG ENOUGH AND YOU MUST HEAR ME CRIED HE BOLDLY INTERCEPTING MY RETREAT TO THE DOOR
MY AUNT SENT THOMAS IN QUEST OF ME TO ASK IF I WERE NOT COMING TO TEA
WOULD YOU NOT SAY THEY WERE PERFECT STRANGERS ALMOST
AND SHE LOVES YOU I KNOW AND REVERENCES YOU TOO
AND WHAT LITTLE EFFORT I MADE WAS APPARENTLY PRETTY SUCCESSFUL FOR MISS ELIZA WAS NEVER IN A BETTER HUMOUR
REMEMBER YOU ARE NOT YET NINETEEN AND MANY YEARS ARE YET TO PASS BEFORE ANY ONE CAN SET YOU DOWN AS AN OLD MAID
AND YOU NEEDN'T FEAR ME THIS TIME
THIS ALONE AFFORDED STRONG PRESUMPTION THAT I WAS ALREADY FORGOTTEN
AND THAT SHE CERTAINLY WILL WITHDRAW HER FAVOUR FROM HIM IF HE CONTINUES SUCH COURSES
THE BRIGHT BLUE EYES REGARDED THE SPECTATOR WITH A KIND OF LURKING DROLLERY--YOU ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE THEM WINK
THEN CLOSED THE BOOK AND TURNING FROM IT TO ME QUIETLY ASKED THE PRICE OF IT--I FELT THE HOT BLOOD RUSH TO MY FACE
PERHAPS HIS HEART AND HEAD HAD BEEN SO FULL OF HIS FAIR LADY THAT HE HAD HAD BUT LITTLE THOUGHT TO SPARE FOR OTHERS
HIS APPETITE FOR THE STIMULUS OF WINE HAD INCREASED UPON HIM AS I HAD TOO WELL FORESEEN
HE LOOKED UP IN CHILDISH BEWILDERMENT
FOR I SOON GREW TIRED OF STUDYING THEIR PECULIARITIES AND LAUGHING AT THEIR FOIBLES--PARTICULARLY AS I WAS OBLIGED TO KEEP MY CRITICISMS TO MYSELF FOR MY AUNT WOULD NOT HEAR THEM--AND THEY--THE LADIES ESPECIALLY--APPEARED SO PROVOKINGLY MINDLESS AND HEARTLESS AND ARTIFICIAL
BUT WHETHER WANT OF COURAGE OR MISTAKEN KINDNESS WAS THE CAUSE OF MY ERROR I THINK YOU BLAME ME TOO SEVERELY
BUT THIS IS A SAD SAD BUSINESS TO BE SURE WHY MOTHER YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE THESE TALES SAID FERGUS
I OVER-RULED HIS OBJECTIONS AS WELL AS I COULD FOR I TREMBLED AT THE THOUGHTS OF HIS GOING ALONE AND WOULD SACRIFICE ALMOST ANYTHING FOR MYSELF MUCH EVEN FOR MY CHILD TO PREVENT IT
LOOK YE SIR RESUMED HE TURNING TO HIS OTHER NEIGHBOUR AND POINTING PAST ME WITH HIS UMBRELLA THAT'S THE HALL
HOW SWEET HOW MUSICAL MY OWN NAME SOUNDED IN HER MOUTH
BUT THANK GOD I HAVE HOPE--NOT ONLY FROM A VAGUE DEPENDENCE ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT PENITENCE AND PARDON MIGHT HAVE REACHED HIM AT THE LAST BUT FROM THE BLESSED CONFIDENCE THAT THROUGH WHATEVER PURGING FIRES THE ERRING SPIRIT MAY BE DOOMED TO PASS--WHATEVER FATE AWAITS IT--STILL IT IS NOT LOST AND GOD WHO HATETH NOTHING THAT HE HATH MADE WILL BLESS IT IN THE END
HIS MOTHER FREQUENTLY ASKS US OVER THAT SHE MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF HER DEAR WALTER'S COMPANY
HE HAS BEEN ADDRESSING THE COMPANY IN HIS RICHEST VEIN ALL THE WHILE AND EYEING YOU FROM TIME TO TIME WITH LOOKS OF STERN DISTASTE WHILE YOU SAT THERE IRREVERENTLY WHISPERING AND MUTTERING TOGETHER
I WOULDN'T HAVE HER FOR MY WIFE NOT IF SHE'D A KINGDOM FOR HER DOWRY
LEANING AGAINST THE WALL WERE SEVERAL SKETCHES IN VARIOUS STAGES OF PROGRESSION AND A FEW FINISHED PAINTINGS--MOSTLY OF LANDSCAPES AND FIGURES
SO HE IS SAFE AND I AM SURE OF SEEING HIM
ONLY THINK WHAT A MAN YOU WILL MAKE OF HIM IF YOU PERSIST IN I THINK IT A VERY EXCELLENT PLAN INTERRUPTED MRS GRAHAM WITH IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY
BUT NO ONE CAN BLAME ME FOR THAT I THINK THE INVALID ONLY REPLIED BY GROANING ALOUD AND ROLLING HIS HEAD ON A PILLOW IN A PAROXYSM OF IMPATIENCE
THE TINY FEATURES AND LARGE BLUE EYES SMILING THROUGH A SHOCK OF LIGHT BROWN CURLS SHAKEN OVER THE FOREHEAD AS IT BENT ABOVE ITS TREASURE BORE SUFFICIENT RESEMBLANCE TO THOSE OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN BEFORE ME TO PROCLAIM IT A PORTRAIT OF ARTHUR GRAHAM IN HIS EARLY INFANCY
THUS I FLATTER MYSELF I SHALL SECURE HIM FROM THIS ONE VICE
AND ARTHUR PLACED HIMSELF BESIDE POOR MILICENT CONFIDENTIALLY PUSHING HIS HEAD INTO HER FACE AND DRAWING IN CLOSER TO HER AS SHE SHRANK AWAY FROM HIM
BUT THE HORSE KICKED HIM--OR SOMETHING WHAT HIS QUIET LITTLE PONY HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS THAT HE SELDOM RIDES ANY OTHER AT ANY RATE SAID MY MOTHER YOU WILL CALL TO-MORROW
AND FINALLY FOR I OMIT MYSELF MR LAWRENCE WAS GENTLEMANLY AND INOFFENSIVE TO ALL AND POLITE TO THE VICAR AND THE LADIES ESPECIALLY HIS HOSTESS AND HER DAUGHTER AND MISS WILSON--MISGUIDED MAN
I RESPECTFULLY ANSWERED HER INQUIRIES
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH HELEN I DON'T LIKE THE THOUGHTS OF IT AT ALL
I SHOULD LIKE IT ABOVE ALL THINGS RACHEL AND I'D GIVE YOU SUCH WAGES AS I COULD AFFORD
IF YOU CANNOT NEVER WRITE TO ME HELEN I CAN
WHAT MORE WOULD YOU HAVE YOU ARE SORRY THAT I SAW YOU NO DOUBT I ANSWERED COLDLY
BUT OTHERWISE HOW COULD I
I'LL SEARCH ALL ENGLAND THROUGH AT ALL EVENTS HE CRIED WITH A SUDDEN BURST OF HOPE OR DESPERATION
AND IF THEY SCORN ME AS A VICTIM OF THEIR GUILT I CAN PITY THEIR FOLLY AND DESPISE THEIR SCORN
HUNTINGDON I'M RUINED SAID HE TAKING THE THIRD GLASS FROM MY HAND--HE HAD DRUNK THE OTHERS IN DEAD SILENCE
AND I'LL THANK YOU TO RING FOR SOME MORE FOR HERE IS LORD LOWBOROUGH AT LAST
BUT YOU CAN RUN ACROSS THE LAWN AND GET IN AS QUIETLY AS YOU CAN
AND THEN INDEED I SAID A GOOD DEAL ON THE SUBJECT AND REBUKED HIM STERNLY ENOUGH
WELL I'LL SEE ABOUT IT BY ALL MEANS LEAVE HIM CRIED HE EARNESTLY
WILL YOU GO HOME OR SEEK ANOTHER PLACE I HAVE NO HOME MA'AM BUT WITH YOU SHE REPLIED
BUT I HAD BETTER HOLD MY TONGUE
IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING MISS WILMOT WAS CALLED UPON TO SING AND PLAY FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE COMPANY AND I TO EXHIBIT MY DRAWINGS AND THOUGH HE LIKES MUSIC AND SHE IS AN ACCOMPLISHED MUSICIAN I THINK I AM RIGHT IN AFFIRMING THAT HE PAID MORE ATTENTION TO MY DRAWINGS THAN TO HER MUSIC
DO TELL ME WHAT IT IS
HE WAS NOT HOWEVER TO BE REPELLED BY SUCH ACTING AS THIS
HAVE YOU ENOUGH DISINTERESTED AFFECTION TO ENABLE YOU TO SACRIFICE YOUR OWN PLEASURE TO MINE I WOULD GIVE MY LIFE TO SERVE YOU I DON'T WANT YOUR LIFE
SHE CALLED ME GILBERT BY MY EXPRESS DESIRE AND I CALLED HER HELEN FOR I HAD SEEN THAT NAME WRITTEN IN HER BOOKS
BUT HE SAYS I DRIVE HIM TO IT BY MY UNNATURAL UNWOMANLY CONDUCT
IT WAS LIKE SETTING MY LIFE UPON THE CAST OF A DIE
IF YOU BIND YOURSELF TO HER YOU'LL REPENT IT ALL YOUR LIFETIME WHEN YOU LOOK ROUND AND SEE HOW MANY BETTER THERE ARE
I HAD JUST ENSCONCED MYSELF WITHIN THE BOW OF THE WINDOW AND WAS LOOKING OUT UPON THE WEST WHERE THE DARKENING HILLS ROSE SHARPLY DEFINED AGAINST THE CLEAR AMBER LIGHT OF EVENING THAT GRADUALLY BLENDED AND FADED AWAY INTO THE PURE PALE BLUE OF THE UPPER SKY WHERE ONE BRIGHT STAR WAS SHINING THROUGH AS IF TO PROMISE--'WHEN THAT DYING LIGHT IS GONE THE WORLD WILL NOT BE LEFT IN DARKNESS AND THEY WHO TRUST IN GOD WHOSE MINDS ARE UNBECLOUDED BY THE MISTS OF UNBELIEF AND SIN ARE NEVER WHOLLY COMFORTLESS,'--WHEN I HEARD A HURRIED STEP APPROACHING AND LORD LOWBOROUGH ENTERED
BUT I SEE YOU'VE GOT A TASTE OF IT SAID HE LOOKING AT MY HAND THAT HAD ALSO BEEN STRUCK AND WAS RATHER SEVERELY GRAZED
AND MY MOTHER FEARS YOU WILL FEEL SOLITARY IN THIS GREAT HOUSE SO MUCH ALONE AND WISHES SHE COULD PERSUADE YOU TO GIVE HER THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY MORE FREQUENTLY AND MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME IN OUR MORE HUMBLE DWELLING TILL MR HUNTINGDON'S RETURN SHALL RENDER THIS A LITTLE MORE CONDUCIVE TO YOUR COMFORT SHE IS VERY KIND I ANSWERED BUT I AM NOT ALONE YOU SEE;--AND THOSE WHOSE TIME IS FULLY OCCUPIED SELDOM COMPLAIN OF SOLITUDE WILL YOU NOT COME TO-MORROW THEN
BUT ARTHUR ONLY LAUGHED THE MORE
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A BUT IN THIS IMPERFECT WORLD AND I DO WISH HE WOULD SOMETIMES BE SERIOUS
AT LAST ONE MORNING SHE ENTERED MY CHAMBER WITH SUCH INTELLIGENCE THAT MY RESOLUTION WAS TAKEN BEFORE SHE HAD CEASED TO SPEAK
I THINK IT IS YOU THAT ARE CHANGED NOT SHE SAID I BUT WITH THE UTMOST GENTLENESS FOR I DID NOT WISH TO IRRITATE HIM
GOD HELP ME NOW I MURMURED SINKING ON MY KNEES AMONG THE DAMP WEEDS AND BRUSHWOOD THAT SURROUNDED ME AND LOOKING UP AT THE MOONLIT SKY THROUGH THE SCANT FOLIAGE ABOVE
HE SMILED AND COLOURED AS IF HALF-PROUD AND HALF-ASHAMED OF HIS IDENTITY
IS IT TO BE THE LAST LOWBOROUGH I ASKED WHEN I GOT HIM INTO THE STREET
WITHIN MY HEART THEY STILL SHALL DWELL
PERHAPS A HALF-SUPPRESSED SOB HAD CAUGHT HIS EAR AND CAUSED HIM TO LOOK ROUND--HEAVEN FORBID
HE WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM TALKING WITH MESSRS
AND MILICENT TURNED PALE AND ALMOST STARTED FROM HER SEAT AS MR HATTERSLEY BURST INTO THE ROOM WITH A CLAMOROUS VOLLEY OF OATHS IN HIS MOUTH WHICH HARGRAVE ENDEAVOURED TO CHECK BY ENTREATING HIM TO REMEMBER THE LADIES
I FOUND MRS GRAHAM ALREADY EQUIPPED FOR DEPARTURE AND TAKING LEAVE OF THE REST WHO WERE NOW RETURNED TO THE HOUSE
IT WAS TRUE ELIZA WAS NOT BESIDE ME
BUT TELL HIM HE MUST NOT THINK OF ME I CAN GIVE YOU A FEW EXTRACTS FROM THE REST OF THE LETTER FOR I WAS PERMITTED TO KEEP THIS ALSO--PERHAPS AS AN ANTIDOTE TO ALL PERNICIOUS HOPES AND FANCIES
TO SMILE IF POSSIBLE WHEN HE SMILES BE CHEERFUL WHEN HE IS CHEERFUL AND PLEASED WHEN HE IS AGREEABLE
HER COMPLEXION WAS CLEAR AND PALE
BUT WITH WHOM MRS HUNTINGDON WITH MY SON
BUT DO YOU PREFER SINKING WITHOUT AN EFFORT INTO THE STATE OF TORMENT YOU PICTURE TO YOURSELF OH IT'S ALL A FABLE SAID HE CONTEMPTUOUSLY
AM I NOT GROWN SAID HE STRETCHING HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT
AND AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION RESPECTING THE TIME AND MANNER OF THE PROJECTED EXCURSION WE ROSE AND TOOK OUR LEAVE
FOR YOU PERCEIVE I AM ALMOST AS MISERABLE JUST NOW AS YOU NEED WISH TO SEE ME
AND THEN HOW CAN I TELL THAT I AM OPPRESSING HER WHEN SHE MELTS AWAY AND MAKES NO SIGN
IF THE PERUSAL OF THIS LETTER FILLED ME WITH DISMAY FOR HELEN'S FUTURE LIFE AND MINE THERE WAS ONE GREAT SOURCE OF CONSOLATION
AND THEN AS I WAS TOO GOOD-NATURED TO RESENT HIS UNMANNERLY CONDUCT AND HE BORE NO MALICE AGAINST ME,--HE WAS NEVER UNWILLING TO TALK TO ME
AND WE SOON BECAME EXCELLENT FRIENDS--HOW MUCH TO THE GRATIFICATION OF HIS MAMMA I CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO SAY
YOU'LL SOON TIRE OF PETTING AND HUMOURING YOUR WIFE BE SHE EVER SO CHARMING AND THEN COMES THE TRIAL WELL THEN WE MUST BEAR ONE ANOTHER'S BURDENS THEN YOU MUST FALL EACH INTO YOUR PROPER PLACE
BUT--DEAR ME
OF COURSE I WAS BURNING WITH ANGER BUT PRIDE OBLIGED ME TO SUPPRESS MY FEELINGS AND PRESERVE A SMOOTH FACE OR AT LEAST A STOIC CALMNESS THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW
AND WALTER TOO IS SO SERIOUSLY DISPLEASED AT MY PERVERSITY AND ABSURD CAPRICE AS HE CALLS IT THAT I FEAR HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME--I DID NOT THINK HE COULD BE SO UNKIND AS HE HAS LATELY SHOWN HIMSELF
YES I SEE BUT WE'RE ALMOST IN DARKNESS HERE
IN THE SIGHT OF HEAVEN HE HAS FORFEITED ALL CLAIM TO SHE SEIZED MY ARM WITH A GRASP OF STARTLING ENERGY
YOU LITTLE KNOW THE MISERY OF UNITING YOUR FORTUNES TO SUCH A MAN I HAVE SUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM AUNT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL YOU SAY THAT I WOULD WILLINGLY RISK MY HAPPINESS FOR THE CHANCE OF SECURING HIS
BUT HOW WILLINGLY I SOUGHT MY PILLOW AND HOW MUCH SLEEP IT BROUGHT ME I LEAVE YOU TO IMAGINE
YOND'S THE PARK MY HEART SANK WITHIN ME TO BEHOLD THAT STATELY MANSION IN THE MIDST OF ITS EXPANSIVE GROUNDS
CHAPTER XV THAT DAY WAS RAINY LIKE ITS PREDECESSOR
FOR IT WAS NO MARKET-DAY AND THE ROAD I TRAVERSED WAS LITTLE FREQUENTED AT ANY OTHER TIME
BUT HOWEVER I PROMISED TO COME
HE DOESN'T SAY MUCH TO BE SURE BUT HIS VERY SILENCE IMPLIES MORE THAN ALL THE OTHERS WORDS AND THE LESS HE SAYS THE MORE HE THINKS--AND THIS IS HARGRAVE'S MISSIVE
MY SOUR PALE FACE WAS PERFECTLY REPULSIVE
ONLY YOU BOTHER ME RATHER SOMETIMES I BOTHER YOU CRIED SHE IN VERY NATURAL SURPRISE
HE TOOK HIMSELF OFF TO VISIT SOME OF THEM INSTEAD
NEITHER IS IT AN ACT OF ANY FORBEARANCE
BUT WHEN I CALLED THERE THE DAY AFTER MY INTERVIEW WITH MRS GRAHAM HE HAPPENED TO BE FROM HOME--A CIRCUMSTANCE BY NO MEANS SO AGREEABLE TO ME NOW AS IT HAD BEEN ON FORMER OCCASIONS
HER HEART HAD BEEN FULL ENOUGH OF HER OWN SORROWS BUT IT OVERFLOWED AT THE IDEA OF MINE
AND MY SOUL IS SICK OF SOLITUDE
GRIMSBY STARED AND WONDERED
BUT I THOUGHT THERE WAS A CERTAIN REFINED AFFECTATION OF SUPERIORITY AND AN UNGENIAL SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT HER THAT NEGATIVED ALL HER ADVANTAGES
THE LETTER-BAG WAS ALREADY THERE WAITING TO BE OPENED
I GRASPED THE GATE-POST FOR SUPPORT AND STOOD INTENTLY GAZING TOWARDS THE DOOR TO TAKE MY LAST LOOK ON MY SOUL'S DELIGHT MY FIRST ON THAT DETESTED MORTAL WHO HAD TORN HER FROM MY HEART AND DOOMED HER I WAS CERTAIN TO A LIFE OF MISERY AND HOLLOW VAIN REPINING--FOR WHAT HAPPINESS COULD SHE ENJOY WITH HIM
BUT THAT'S NO FAULT OF HIS AND THEN HIS LOOK CONTINUED SHE
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN AND JUST THIS MINUTE TOO
YES--IT IS NOT SHE
WHETHER TO GIVE WAY TO MY FEELINGS OR RESTRAIN THEM STILL
I SUPPOSE HE IS STRIVING TO WIN MY ESTEEM IF HE CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY HE MAY WIN IT
WINGED BY THIS HOPE AND GOADED BY THESE FEARS I HURRIED HOMEWARDS TO PREPARE FOR MY DEPARTURE ON THE MORROW
DO YOU DENY REPLIED HE SMILINGLY POINTING TO THE BOARD
WHEN MUST IT BE
I STOOD HOWEVER IN THE SHADOW OF THE TALL HOLLY-BUSH WHICH STANDING BETWEEN THE WINDOW AND THE PORCH AT PRESENT SCREENED ME FROM OBSERVATION BUT DID NOT PREVENT ME FROM SEEING TWO FIGURES COME FORTH INTO THE MOONLIGHT
THERE IS WALTER HARGRAVE MILICENT'S BROTHER FOR ONE
REALLY YOU MUST EXCUSE ME CRIED SHE
IT WILL NOT SYMPATHISE WITH MY DISTRESSES BUT THEN IT WILL NOT LAUGH AT THEM AND IF I KEEP IT CLOSE IT CANNOT TELL AGAIN
BE QUICK BENSON
SHE THINKS ONLY OF HERSELF
I MUST TEAR MYSELF AWAY AT ONCE AND BANISH OR SUPPRESS ALL THOUGHTS OF HER LIKE THE REMEMBRANCE OF A WILD MAD DREAM
OH MR MARKHAM HOW YOU BLUSH CRIED SHE WITH A TORMENTING LAUGH
AND IF I CAN REALLY FEEL MYSELF JUSTIFIED IN INDULGING THIS ATTACHMENT I CAN DARE ANYTHING EVEN THE ANGER AND GRIEF OF MY BEST FRIEND FOR ITS OBJECT--SURELY I SHALL SOON KNOW
HAVE YOU BEEN READING NOVELS BLESS YOU NO SAID SHE WITH A SORROWFUL SHAKE OF THE HEAD
IT WAS EXHAUSTION THAT TILL THEN I HAD BEEN ENABLED SUCCESSFULLY TO COMBAT
WHAT OF HER OH NOTHING!--I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT HER;--ONLY THAT SHE'S A NICE AMUSING LITTLE THING WHEN SHE IS IN A MERRY HUMOUR AND I SHOULDN'T MIND CALLING HER HUSH HUSH MY DEAR
AND YET IF YOU LOVED ME FAR LESS THAN YOU DO I WOULD NOT COMPLAIN PROVIDED YOU LOVED YOUR MAKER MORE
IN GOD'S NAME LET THEM NOT SUNDER OUR SOULS CRIED I IN TERROR LEST SHE SHOULD DEEM IT HER DUTY TO DENY US THIS LAST REMAINING CONSOLATION
AND KNEELING BEFORE ME WITH CLASPED HANDS UPLIFTED IN MOCK HUMILIATION HE CONTINUED IMPLORINGLY--'FORGIVE ME HELEN--DEAR HELEN FORGIVE ME AND I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN AND BURYING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDKERCHIEF HE AFFECTED TO SOB ALOUD
BUT FOR YOUR SATISFACTION I WILL ADD A FEW WORDS MORE
IS IT SIR SAID I
AND AS TO LOOKING ASKANCE TO ANOTHER WOMAN HE'S SAFE ENOUGH FOR THAT TOO WHILE I LIVE FOR HE WORSHIPS THE VERY GROUND I TREAD ON INDEED
NO NO ARTHUR
BUT WE'D A MERRY TIME OF IT TOO THOUGH MINGLED WITH SORROW AND PAIN AS LOWBOROUGH KNOWS TO HIS COST--HA HA AND WHILE HE WAS LAUGHING AT THE RECOLLECTION OF LOWBOROUGH'S TROUBLES MY UNCLE CAME AND SLAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER
FOR I DO NOT WISH TO BE SET DOWN AS AN INFIDEL
SO HE TALKED COMMON-PLACE WITH MY MOTHER AND ROSE AND DISCUSSED PARISH AFFAIRS WITH THE VICAR FARMING MATTERS WITH ME AND POLITICS WITH US BOTH
HE SWORE AT ME AND TOOK THE NOW PACIFIED CHILD AWAY
NO ONE BEING THERE I DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE STABLE MYSELF STRAPPED THE SADDLE ON TO HIS BACK AND THE BRIDLE ON TO HIS HEAD MOUNTED AND SPEEDILY GALLOPED AWAY TO WOODFORD
IT WILL BE THE RUIN OF HIM IN THE END BUT IT IS ALL MY FAULT
AND THIS IS NO SUBJECT FOR JESTING HELEN--I AM SORRY TO SEE YOU TREAT THE MATTER IN THAT LIGHT WAY
I SAID NOTHING MORE ON THE SUBJECT HOWEVER AT THE TIME AND BUT LITTLE ON ANY OTHER
I LET HIM OUT AND THEN QUIETLY TOOK UP THE BOOK
GRAND PARK YOU SEE AND ALL THEM WOODS--PLENTY OF TIMBER THERE AND LOTS OF GAME
SO LET ME ENTREAT YOU TO LEAVE ME I WILL
NOW HALFORD I BID YOU ADIEU FOR THE PRESENT
AND NOW THOSE SACRED PERSONS ONCE REMOVED I SHALL CARRY ALL BEFORE ME OH WALTER HOW YOU TALK CRIED MILICENT
IF IT WERE SHE SHOULD TELL ME SO
BUT THE NIGHT WAS LONG AND DARK
ROSE WAS SIMPLE AND NATURAL AS USUAL AND FULL OF MIRTH AND VIVACITY
YOU NEEDN'T HAVE WAITED FOR ME WAS HIS
AND YOU CAN HAVE THE PONY AS YOUR HORSE IS TIRED
BUT HER SON WITH CHILDISH IMPERTINENCE ARRESTED HER BY EXCLAIMING,--'MAMMA YOU HAVE NOT SHAKEN HANDS WITH MR MARKHAM SHE LAUGHINGLY TURNED ROUND AND HELD OUT HER HAND
AND STEADILY CONFRONTING HIS GAZE I ANSWERED CALMLY MR HARGRAVE DO YOU MEAN TO INSULT ME HE WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THIS
JUNE 29TH.--NO ARTHUR YET
THE ROLLING HOWEVER WAS SOON COMPLETED
FOR ALL THE EVIL YOU HAVE DONE ME AND ALL YOU WOULD HAVE DONE I PRAY GOD TO PARDON YOU AND MAKE YOU OF A BETTER MIND HERE THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN AND MESSRS
WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER BE THAN MRS HUNTINGDON--EH I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I'VE CONSIDERED THE MATTER AH
SHARP ANSWERS WERE RECEIVED AS SMART SALLIES OF GIRLISH VIVACITY THAT ONLY REQUIRED AN INDULGENT REBUKE
I WAITED CALMLY IN THE HALL TO BE ANNOUNCED BUT INWARDLY DETERMINED TO TAKE NO DENIAL
HE SAID I WAS NOT FIT TO TEACH CHILDREN OR TO BE WITH THEM
AND MY AUNT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE NEXT MORNING TO PERSUADE HIM TO RETURN TO THE COUNTRY IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE CLOSE OF THE SEASON
CHAPTER XXXII OCTOBER 5TH.--ESTHER HARGRAVE IS GETTING A FINE GIRL
THEN SUPPRESSING MY IRRITATION I ADDED I'VE BEEN WALKING TOO FAST THAT'S ALL
I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT YOU THINK THEN THAT HE IS A VIRTUOUS WELL-CONDUCTED YOUNG MAN I KNOW NOTHING POSITIVE RESPECTING HIS CHARACTER
BUT I MIGHT HAVE SPARED MYSELF THAT MOMENTARY PANG OF SELF-REPROACH
DO YOU THINK IT NONSENSE HELEN
AND I WAS GLAD OF IT FOR I LONGED TO KNOW THE TRUTH
ON YOUR HEALTH YOU KNOW DEPENDS THE HEALTH IF NOT THE LIFE OF OUR FUTURE HOPE THEN YOU REALLY WISH TO GET RID OF ME POSITIVELY I DO
AND WHAT MAGNIFICENT BLACK EYES
I DID NOT ANSWER
I DID NOT ANSWER
I DID NOT ANSWER
AS I BADE FAREWELL FOR EVER TO THAT PLACE THE SCENE OF SO MUCH GUILT AND MISERY I FELT GLAD THAT I HAD NOT LEFT IT BEFORE FOR NOW THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE PROPRIETY OF SUCH A STEP--NO SHADOW OF REMORSE FOR HIM I LEFT BEHIND
BUT YOU WOULD NOT JUDGE OF A BOY BY YOURSELF--AND MY DEAR MRS GRAHAM LET ME WARN YOU IN GOOD TIME AGAINST THE ERROR--THE FATAL ERROR I MAY CALL IT--OF TAKING THAT BOY'S EDUCATION UPON YOURSELF
I WOULD GO AT ONCE AND SHE SHOULD NEVER KNOW THAT I HAD APPROACHED THE PLACE OF HER ABODE
NOW THEN LET ME SEE HIM BUT I CANNOT TRUST YOUR OATHS AND PROMISES
FOR WHEN HAVING PARTIALLY RELIEVED MYSELF BY A TORMENT OF TEARS AND LOOKED UP AT THE MOON SHINING SO CALMLY AND CARELESSLY ON AS LITTLE INFLUENCED BY MY MISERY AS I WAS BY ITS PEACEFUL RADIANCE AND EARNESTLY PRAYED FOR DEATH OR FORGETFULNESS I HAD RISEN AND JOURNEYED HOMEWARDS--LITTLE REGARDING THE WAY BUT CARRIED INSTINCTIVELY BY MY FEET TO THE DOOR I FOUND IT BOLTED AGAINST ME AND EVERY ONE IN BED EXCEPT MY MOTHER WHO HASTENED TO ANSWER MY IMPATIENT KNOCKING AND RECEIVED ME WITH A SHOWER OF QUESTIONS AND REBUKES
LET ME ONCE GET CLEAR OF GRASSDALE AND I SHALL CONSIDER MYSELF SAFE MR HARGRAVE ADVANCED ONE STEP TOWARDS ME LOOKED ME IN THE FACE AND DREW IN HIS BREATH TO SPEAK
AND AFTER THAT I OFTEN MET HIM
OH NO!--BUT IF YOU WOULD HAVE A BOY TO DESPISE HIS MOTHER LET HER KEEP HIM AT HOME AND SPEND HER LIFE IN PETTING HIM UP AND SLAVING TO INDULGE HIS FOLLIES AND CAPRICES I PERFECTLY AGREE WITH YOU MRS MARKHAM
SUCH DISGRACEFUL SCENES OR NEARLY SUCH HAVE BEEN REPEATED MORE THAN ONCE
THANK HEAVEN THEY ARE ALL GOING TO-MORROW
HIS HIGH DELIGHT AT BEING ABLE TO SERVE ME WAS CHASTENED BY SYMPATHY FOR ME AND COMMISERATION FOR HIMSELF--ABOUT I KNOW NOT WHAT FOR I WOULD NOT STAY TO INQUIRE OR SUFFER HIM TO UNBURDEN HIS SORROWS TO ME
HE MIGHT COME HOME AT ANY HOUR OF THE NIGHT OR MORNING OR NOT COME HOME AT ALL
WHILE SHE RESTED HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER AND ABSTRACTEDLY PLAYED WITH THE LONG WAVY CURLS THAT FELL ON HIS IVORY NECK
ARTHUR IF YOU'RE NOT A GOOD BOY I SHALL GIVE YOU A GLASS OF WINE OR NOW ARTHUR IF YOU SAY THAT AGAIN YOU SHALL HAVE SOME BRANDY-AND-WATER IS AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER THREAT
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WILL HAVE A FELLOW-FEELING FOR THE OLD LADY AND WILL WISH TO KNOW THE LAST OF HER HISTORY
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS BOOK AND IF YOU PLEASE TO TAKE IT AND PERUSE IT AT YOUR LEISURE
BUT THE LADIES WILL DRIVE AND WALK BY TURNS
BUT ALL REGRET AND APPREHENSION VANISHED LIKE A DREAM WHEN I HEARD THAT MR HUNTINGDON WAS ACTUALLY TO BE A THIRD
NOW I RAISED HER HAND TO MY LIPS AND FERVENTLY KISSED IT AGAIN AND AGAIN
I TOOK UP A BOOK AND TRIED TO READ
YOU ARE CONTENTED FOR YOURSELF BUT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE YOUR SISTER TO SUFFER THE SAME AS YOU NO--OR WORSE
I HAD NO EARTHLY HOPE BUT THIS AND HE SEEMS TO TAKE A DIABOLICAL DELIGHT IN TEARING IT AWAY
I SAW ONE OR TWO GENTLEMEN IN LONDON THAT I MIGHT HAVE LIKED BUT THEY WERE YOUNGER SONS AND MAMMA WOULD NOT LET ME GET TO KNOW THEM--ONE ESPECIALLY WHO I BELIEVE RATHER LIKED ME--BUT SHE THREW EVERY POSSIBLE OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF OUR BETTER ACQUAINTANCE
AND THOUGH IT BE HARD AS THE NETHER MILLSTONE YOU'LL FIND IT THE EASIER FOOTING AFTER ALL I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN RALPH SAID SHE NERVOUSLY PLAYING WITH HER WATCHGUARD AND TRACING THE FIGURE ON THE RUG WITH THE POINT OF HER TINY FOOT--'I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
HAD THERE BEEN A LADY ANYWHERE WITHIN REACH OF ANY AGE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND FORTY-FIVE HE WOULD HAVE SOUGHT REVENGE AND FOUND EMPLOYMENT IN GETTING UP OR TRYING TO GET UP A DESPERATE FLIRTATION WITH HER
SHE HAD AT HER OWN DESIRE RECEIVED A REGULAR BOARDING-SCHOOL EDUCATION SUPERIOR TO WHAT ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY HAD OBTAINED BEFORE
THE AIR WAS SIMPLE SWEET AND SAD
I CANNOT ENJOY MY BOOKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT POWER TO ARREST MY ATTENTION
ROSE WOULD GO STARK MAD IN SUCH A PLACE
GILBERT WILL LIKE IT FOR HIS SUPPER."--I'M NOTHING AT ALL
ONE NIGHT HOWEVER AT A BALL HE HAD BEEN MORE THAN USUALLY TORMENTING AND MY PATIENCE WAS QUITE EXHAUSTED
DON'T YOU SEE SHE IS PREJUDICED AGAINST YOU I DO DEAREST
BUT THANK HEAVEN I DON'T
HARDENED I FEAR--HARDENED HE REPLIED WITH A DESPONDENT SHAKE OF THE HEAD
HE HAS NO SECRET CURIOSITY NO HANKERING DESIRE
AND I WILL DO THE LADY THE CREDIT TO SAY THAT HER HUSBAND IS QUITE AN ALTERED MAN
FOR THINK OF THE FULL MEANING OF EACH AND HOW MANY INESTIMABLE VIRTUES THEY INCLUDE AND I MIGHT ADD MANY MORE TO THE LIST AND CONSIDER THAT ALL THIS IS LAID AT YOUR FEET
MY BURNING BURSTING HEART STROVE TO POUR FORTH ITS AGONY TO GOD BUT COULD NOT FRAME ITS ANGUISH INTO PRAYER
I IN LOVE WITH HER REPEATED HE
THE DOOR BEING NOW FREE MILICENT ATTEMPTED TO MAKE HER ESCAPE FROM THE SCENE OF HER HUSBAND'S DISGRACE
BUT I AM TRULY MISERABLE--MORE SO THAN I LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE TO MYSELF
HOW NERVOUS YOU ARE WHAT THE DEUCE DID YOU DO IT FOR CRIED HE QUITE TESTILY EXTRICATING HIMSELF FROM MY ARMS AND WIPING HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF
I'VE HAD A DREADFUL TIME OF IT I ASSURE YOU
I FOUND HIM SEATED IN A RECUMBENT POSITION ON THE BANK,--LOOKING VERY WHITE AND SICKLY STILL AND HOLDING HIS CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF NOW MORE RED THAN WHITE TO HIS HEAD
YOU KNOW I HATE SUCH JESTS I CONTINUED
BUT I THINK IT IS NOT WRONG--NO NO--THERE IS A SECRET SOMETHING--AN INWARD INSTINCT THAT ASSURES ME I AM RIGHT
GIVE ME THE LETTER AND HE SHALL SEE IT AS SURE AS I'M A LIVING MAN NO HE SHALL NOT SEE IT WITHOUT HER CONSENT
MY LOVE HAD BEEN CHERISHED IN VAIN--MY HOPE WAS GONE FOR EVER
A SPIRIT OF CANDOUR AND FRANKNESS WHEN WHOLLY UNACCOMPANIED WITH COARSENESS HE ADMIRED IN OTHERS BUT HE COULD NOT ACQUIRE IT HIMSELF
AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER UNLESS I HEARD IT FROM HER OWN LIPS.--I SHOULD AS SOON BELIEVE SUCH THINGS OF YOU ROSE OH GILBERT WELL DO YOU THINK I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING OF THE KIND,--WHATEVER THE WILSONS AND MILLWARDS DARED TO WHISPER I SHOULD HOPE NOT INDEED AND WHY NOT?--BECAUSE I KNOW YOU--WELL AND I KNOW HER JUST AS WELL OH NO
I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW HE WOULD COMPORT HIMSELF TO MRS GRAHAM
AND THEN I FIGURATIVELY BLUSHED FOR MY INCONSTANCY
THE FORMER IT IS TRUE WAS MOST PROVOKINGLY UNSOCIABLE AT FIRST--SEEMINGLY BENT UPON TALKING TO NO ONE BUT MARY MILLWARD AND ARTHUR
HUNTINGDON I AM NOT A CASTAWAY SAID HE SEIZING MY HAND AND SQUEEZING IT LIKE A VICE
I'LL KEEP HIM TALKING THERE ABOUT THOSE MATTERS I MENTIONED AND ANYTHING ELSE I CAN THINK OF AS LONG AS I CAN AND THEN BRING HIM ROUND THE OTHER WAY STOPPING TO LOOK AT THE TREES THE FIELDS AND ANYTHING ELSE I CAN FIND TO DISCOURSE OF MR HARGRAVE PAUSED AND LOOKED AT ME
AND I SHOULD FREEZE ALL THE SUNSHINE OUT OF HIS HEART AND MAKE HIM AS GLOOMY AN ASCETIC AS MYSELF IF I HAD THE HANDLING OF HIM MUCH LONGER
AND ARE YOU SURE YOU DESERVE IT WHY AS TO THAT I CAN'T SAY
COULD SHE HAVE BEEN CONTENTED TO REMAIN SINGLE I OWN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SATISFIED
MY FATHER YOU KNOW WAS SOMETHING OF A MISER AND IN HIS LATTER DAYS ESPECIALLY SAW NO PLEASURE IN LIFE BUT TO AMASS RICHES
INDEFINITE DREAMS OF THE FAR PAST AND BRIGHT ANTICIPATIONS OF THE FUTURE SEEMED TO GREET ME AT EVERY TURN
FOR I AM NOT DISPOSED TO ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS AT PRESENT EXCEPT THIS NO NOT ONE MORE LAUGHED SHE AND INSTANTLY QUITTING HER SEAT SHE SOUGHT REFUGE AT THE WINDOW BY WHICH I WAS SEATED AND IN VERY DESPERATION TO ESCAPE MY BROTHER'S PERSECUTIONS ENDEAVOURED TO DRAW ME INTO CONVERSATION
AND THOUGH HE IS PEEVISH AND TESTY WITH HIS SERVANTS AND HIS DOGS HE IS GENTLE AND KIND TO ME
SHE WOULD THINK IT A RASH WILD STEP BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW WELL I KNOW YOU
BUT I CHECKED IT EFFECTUALLY BY PUTTING INTO HER HAND THE BOOK I HAD BEEN TRYING TO READ ON THE FLY-LEAF OF WHICH I HAD HASTILY SCRIBBLED I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT
I HEARD SOMETHING VERY LIKE IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WOULD HAVE SAID IF YOU HADN'T INTERRUPTED HIM AND WOULD YOU HAVE ACCEPTED HIM HELEN IF HE HAD PROPOSED OF COURSE NOT--WITHOUT CONSULTING UNCLE AND YOU OH
I LOVE HIM STILL
YOU'LL FIND A MAN CAN LIVE WITHOUT HIS MONEY AS MERRILY AS A TORTOISE WITHOUT ITS HEAD OR A WASP WITHOUT ITS BODY BUT I'M IN DEBT SAID HE--"DEEP IN DEBT
THIS STARTLING CONDUCT HAD A SINGULAR EFFECT UPON HIM
EVERY VESTIGE OF DISPLEASURE SOON MELTED AWAY BENEATH IT LIKE MORNING CLOUDS BEFORE THE SUMMER SUN
SHE FIXED HER EYES UPON ME WITH A LOOK THAT PIERCED ME TO THE HEART
AND THEN HIS WIFE ADVISED HIM TO IT THEY SAY
ARE YOU FOND OF CHILDREN MR HARGRAVE SAID I A LITTLE SOFTENED TOWARDS HIM
YET AS I DID SO MY HEART WHISPERED ALL WAS NOT RIGHT AND BROUGHT A GLOW TO MY FACE WHICH HE HEIGHTENED BY HIS STEADY SERIOUS GAZE WHILE BY HIS MANNER OF RECEIVING THOSE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS HE MORE THAN DOUBLED MY MISGIVINGS
AS GOOD AS TO SAY YOU WISH WE WOULD ALL OF US MIND OUR OWN BUSINESS AND LET YOU ALONE NO I DISLIKE AN EXTENSIVE ACQUAINTANCE
SHE WILL NEITHER SEE IT NOR VALUE IT NOR CHERISH IT
WELL MIGHT THE SERVANT SAY HIS MASTER WAS VERY CLOSE BUT WHY THIS STRANGE RESERVE TO ME
AND IT'S A THOUSAND PITIES YOU DIDN'T GO WITH ME GILBERT FOR ELIZA MILLWARD WAS THERE WELL
FOR YOU SHOULD NEVER BE TEMPTED TO MARRY A MAN WHO WAS DEFICIENT IN SENSE OR PRINCIPLE HOWEVER HANDSOME OR CHARMING IN OTHER RESPECTS HE MIGHT BE FOR YOU COULD NOT LOVE HIM
BUT SOON MY HEART BEGAN TO WARM TOWARDS HER ONCE AGAIN
WELL THEN WHAT MAKES YOU SO CROSS
LOWBOROUGH WAS QUITE INFATUATED--NOT WILLINGLY BUT OF NECESSITY,--HE WAS ALWAYS RESOLVING TO GIVE IT UP AND ALWAYS BREAKING HIS RESOLUTIONS
AND ARTHUR IS YOUNG TOO
THAT'S RIGHT GRIMSBY KEEP HIM BACK AND EVEN HIS LOW LAUGH REACHED ME AS HE WALKED AWAY
HE SALUTED ME WITH A VERY FINE COMPLIMENT DELICATELY WORDED AND MODESTLY DELIVERED WITHAL WHICH HE HAD DOUBTLESS CONCOCTED AS HE RODE ALONG
AND WHO ON HER PART HAD BEEN BETTER ABLE TO SEE AND APPRECIATE THAT LADY'S TRUE CHARACTER AND QUALITIES THAN THE BRIGHTEST GENIUS AMONG THEM
AND IF HE HAD REASON TO BE PROUD OF THE SWEET LADY ON HIS ARM HE HAD NO LESS CAUSE TO BE ASHAMED OF HAVING CONCEALED HIS GOOD FORTUNE SO LONG
FORBIDDEN EVEN TO ASSURE HER OF MY SYMPATHY FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF ANY SUCH MESSAGE THROUGH MR LAWRENCE WAS NOW COMPLETELY OUT OF THE QUESTION
THEY WILL NOT DISTURB US I COULD NOT QUITE DECIPHER THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE
INCLINING TO DUSK AS IT WAS I KNEW HIM AT A GLANCE
I WON'T TASTE IT I TELL YOU
NO NEVER NEVER NEVER
THOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MAN SO CIRCUMSTANCED AS HE IS TO FIX THE PRECISE DAY OF HIS RETURN
AT FIRST HIS EXTREME DREAD OF DEATH RENDERED THE TASK AN EASY ONE
HE CONTINUED LOUNGING ON THE SOFA AND ALTERNATELY CLOSING HIS EYES AND LOOKING AT HIS WATCH AND AT ME TILL BED-TIME WHEN I ROSE AND TOOK MY CANDLE AND RETIRED
HE AND ARTHUR FREQUENTLY MEET TO PURSUE THEIR RURAL SPORTS TOGETHER
FOR MY HEART SWELLED WITH UNSPEAKABLE DELIGHT AND MY SPIRITS ROSE ALMOST TO MADNESS IN SPITE OF MY PRUDENT ENDEAVOURS TO BIND THEM DOWN TO A REASONABLE PLATITUDE BY THINKING OF THE UNDENIABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HELEN'S RANK AND MINE
DURING THE FIRST FEW DAYS I THOUGHT SHE SEEMED VERY SOLICITOUS TO WIN HIS ADMIRATION
THIS IS A HARSH JUDGMENT TO FORM OF DEAR NOBLE-MINDED GENEROUS-HEARTED WALTER BUT I FEAR IT IS TOO JUST
AND FIRST IT STRUCK ME THAT THERE WAS A LIKENESS
HE EMBRACED ME TENDERLY
BUT NO MATTER HE RECKLESSLY ADDED AND THUS CONTINUED HIS RELATION
AND SOME THROUGH WEAKNESS HAVE FALLEN INTO SNARES AND TEMPTATIONS TERRIBLE TO RELATE WELL I SHALL BE NEITHER CARELESS NOR WEAK REMEMBER PETER HELEN
AT ONE TIME IT WAS,--'IT AMAZES ME MRS GRAHAM HOW YOU COULD CHOOSE SUCH A DILAPIDATED RICKETY OLD PLACE AS THIS TO LIVE IN
YOU MUST GO AND SEE HIM TO-MORROW SAID MY MOTHER
AND HE SO GOOD A MAN I DON'T HATE HIM AS A MAN BUT AS A HUSBAND
IT IS ENOUGH THAT YOU DISLIKE HIM I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY SO
IT WAS INDEED THE SHARP PRACTICE CONNECTED WITH THIS ASTONISHING JUDGMENT WHICH LED TO THE SISTERS HURRIED JOURNEY TO LONDON IN 1848--THE FAMOUS JOURNEY WHEN THE TWO LITTLE LADIES IN BLACK REVEALED THEMSELVES TO MR SMITH AND PROVED TO HIM THAT THEY WERE NOT ONE CURRER BELL BUT TWO MISS BRONTES
HE IS GONE WITH HARGRAVE TO JOIN A DISTANT HUNT AND WILL PROBABLY NOT BE BACK BEFORE TO-MORROW EVENING
I ASKED THE NAME AND RESIDENCE OF THE KIND AND PIOUS FAMILY
SHE'S POORLY I TELL YOU JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT ME FROM COMMITTING THE IMPROPRIETY OF TAKING THE CITADEL BY STORM AND PUSHING FORWARD UNANNOUNCED AN INNER DOOR OPENED AND LITTLE ARTHUR APPEARED WITH HIS FROLICSOME PLAYFELLOW THE DOG
FOR I AM ABOUT TO LEAVE WOODFORD FOR A WHILE AND MAY NOT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU AGAIN FOR A MONTH OR TWO WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GRASSDALE FIRST SAID HE WITH A HALF-SMILE HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE SUPPRESSED IF HE COULD
I AM MARRIED NOW AND SETTLED DOWN AS MRS HUNTINGDON OF GRASSDALE MANOR
THERE'S NOT ONE KIND WISH FOR ME OR ONE GOOD WORD FOR YOU AMONG THEM ALL
MY OBJECT IN WRITING THE FOLLOWING PAGES WAS NOT SIMPLY TO AMUSE THE READER
I WAS SERVANT YONDER FOR SEVERAL YEARS
AND NOW LET ME ASK--HAVE YOU HEARD WHAT HAS LATELY BEFALLEN THIS FRIEND OF YOURS?--BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE NOT I WILL NOT BE INSULTED MR MARKHAM CRIED SHE ALMOST INFURIATED AT MY MANNER
THERE'S NO NEED TO ASK MY PARDON REPLIED HER FRIEND BUT I SEE NO ONE HERE THAT AT ALL RESEMBLES THAT CHILD EXCEPT HIS MOTHER AND WHEN YOU HEAR ILL-NATURED REPORTS MISS ELIZA I WILL THANK YOU THAT IS I THINK YOU WILL DO WELL TO REFRAIN FROM REPEATING THEM
AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE
AS I APPROACHED SHE ABRUPTLY TURNED AWAY AND WENT TO THE WINDOW
NOTHING CAN ATONE FOR IT,--FOR NOTHING CAN RECALL THOSE YEARS OF CURSED CREDULITY
B
MY AUNT IS GREATLY AGAINST HIS COMING OF COURSE
AT FIRST INDEED SHE HAD SEEMED TO TAKE A PLEASURE IN MORTIFYING MY VANITY AND CRUSHING MY PRESUMPTION--RELENTLESSLY NIPPING OFF BUD BY BUD AS THEY VENTURED TO APPEAR
BUT NONE BUT FOOLS WOULD CREDIT THEM FOR A MOMENT HELEN SO DON'T LET THEM TROUBLE YOU I DID NOT THINK MR MILLWARD A FOOL AND HE BELIEVES IT ALL
WHO WAS THE GENTLEMAN YOU DANCED WITH LAST RESUMED SHE AFTER A PAUSE--'THAT WAS SO OFFICIOUS IN HELPING YOU ON WITH YOUR SHAWL HE WAS NOT OFFICIOUS AT ALL AUNT
BUT WILL YOU PROMISE TO REFORM IF I TELL YOU YES IF I CAN AND WITHOUT OFFENDING A HIGHER AUTHORITY AH
THE IMMEDIATE INJURIES HE SUSTAINED FROM THE ACCIDENT HOWEVER WERE NOT VERY SEVERE AND WOULD AS THE DOCTOR SAYS HAVE BEEN BUT TRIFLING TO A MAN OF TEMPERATE HABITS BUT WITH HIM IT IS VERY DIFFERENT
FOR AFTER LINGERING AWHILE TO SEE IF SHE WOULD COME BACK OR CALL I VENTURED ONE MORE GLANCE AND SAW HER A GOOD WAY OFF MOVING RAPIDLY UP THE FIELD WITH LITTLE ARTHUR RUNNING BY HER SIDE AND APPARENTLY TALKING AS HE WENT
WHERE IS STANINGLEY I ASKED AT LAST
AND I WAS NO HAND AT A POLITE BUT DETERMINED REJECTION NOR WOULD IT HAVE GREATLY AVAILED ME IF I HAD FOR HE WAS TOO COARSE-MINDED TO TAKE ANY REPULSE THAT WAS NOT AS PLAIN AND POSITIVE AS HIS OWN EFFRONTERY
BUT IN HER MISTAKEN KINDNESS SHE WOULD KEEP PERSECUTING HIM WITH HER ATTENTIONS--PRESSING UPON HIM ALL MANNER OF VIANDS UNDER THE NOTION THAT HE WAS TOO BASHFUL TO HELP HIMSELF AND OBLIGING HIM TO SHOUT ACROSS THE ROOM HIS MONOSYLLABIC REPLIES TO THE NUMEROUS QUESTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS BY WHICH SHE VAINLY ATTEMPTED TO DRAW HIM INTO CONVERSATION
HOW INTENSELY I WISH HE WERE WORTHY OF ALL THIS CARE
AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN HE AND I WERE ALONE TOGETHER AFTER PONDERING AWHILE IN ONE OF HIS GLOOMY ABSTRACTED MOODS WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED AND HIS HEAD SUNK ON HIS BREAST HE SUDDENLY WOKE UP AND VEHEMENTLY GRASPING MY ARM SAID HUNTINGDON THIS WON'T DO
AND I MIGHT WELL SHRINK FROM SUCH A DISCLOSURE TILL NECESSITY OBLIGED ME TO MAKE IT
BUT WHILE SHE SPOKE SHE HELD ME SO FAST THAT WITHOUT VIOLENCE I COULD NOT HAVE OBEYED HER
HIS CLOTHES WERE CONSIDERABLY BEMIRED
HE LAUGHED AT MY ANXIETY BUT ASSURED ME THERE WAS NO CAUSE FOR IT AND PROMISED TO ATTEND TO MY ADVICE
HIS FATHER THE BANKER HAVING DIED SOME YEARS AGO AND LEFT HIM ALL HIS RICHES HE HAS NOW FULL SCOPE FOR THE EXERCISE OF HIS PREVAILING TASTES AND I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT RALPH HATTERSLEY ESQ IS CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY FOR HIS NOBLE BREED OF HORSES
I HAVE NOT SEEN HER MYSELF AND THEREFORE CANNOT GIVE YOU A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF HER PERSON AND CONVERSATION AND SO FORTH
I FLEW TO THE SHRUBBERY
FOR WITHOUT APPROVING I CANNOT LOVE
HE HAS NO LOVE FOR YOU MRS HUNTINGDON--NO REVERENCE FOR YOUR SEX NO BELIEF IN VIRTUE NO ADMIRATION FOR ITS IMAGE
I AM BECOME A BURDEN TO MYSELF AND OTHERS AND YOU MIGHT SAVE ME BY A WORD--A GLANCE AND WILL NOT DO IT--IS THIS RIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE I DON'T BELIEVE YOU ANSWERED I
BUT I EXPRESSED MY APPROBATION IN GUARDED TERMS AND FEW WORDS FOR FEAR OF DISPLEASING HER
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW SHE LECTURES ME
SOME WONDERED AT HIS TASTE
SHE'S A WIDOW BUT QUITE YOUNG YET AND UNCOMMON HANDSOME
THE CHILD OBEYED WITH ALACRITY
LET ME REMEMBER THE GAME OF CHESS THE EXPRESSIONS HE USED ON THE OCCASION AND THOSE INDESCRIBABLE LOOKS OF HIS THAT SO JUSTLY ROUSED MY INDIGNATION AND I THINK I SHALL BE SAFE ENOUGH
HE IS NOTHING OF THE KIND WHO TOLD YOU SO MY DEAR
BUT OH DEUCE TAKE THEIR CURSED ENVENOMED TONGUES I MUTTERED IN THE BITTERNESS OF MY SOUL
A SLIGHT FLUSH OF ANGER ROSE TO HARGRAVE'S CHEEK
FOR THERE SAT MISS WILSON CHATTERING WITH ELIZA MILLWARD
HAVING PUT HER COMFORTABLY IN BID HER TAKE CARE OF THE EVENING AIR AND WISHED HER A KIND GOOD-NIGHT I FELT CONSIDERABLY RELIEVED AND HASTENED TO OFFER MY SERVICES TO MRS GRAHAM TO CARRY HER APPARATUS UP THE FIELDS BUT SHE HAD ALREADY HUNG HER CAMP-STOOL ON HER ARM AND TAKEN HER SKETCH-BOOK IN HER HAND AND INSISTED UPON BIDDING ME ADIEU THEN AND THERE WITH THE REST OF THE COMPANY
TWO YEARS I BELIEVE GREAT HEAVEN
HE WAS WORN OUT WITH THE BABY'S RESTLESS NIGHTS AND MUST HAVE SOME REPOSE
BUT ARTHUR WILL NEVER CONSENT TO THAT
SHE SEEMED TO ME TO BE GOOD-HUMOURED ENOUGH ON THE WHOLE
HUNTINGDON GET ME A GLASS TAKE THE BOTTLE MAN SAID I THRUSTING THE BRANDY-BOTTLE INTO HIS HAND--BUT STOP I'M TELLING TOO MUCH MUTTERED THE NARRATOR STARTLED AT THE LOOK I TURNED UPON HIM
SHE HATED HER WORK BUT WOULD PURSUE IT
IT BEING SCARCELY AGREEABLE TO STAND THERE AMONG SO MANY GAZERS AND KEEPING THEIR FRIENDS WAITING INTO THE BARGAIN
I NOW RAISED MY HEAD
MILICENT SAW THAT I WISHED TO BE QUIET AND ACCORDINGLY LET ME ALONE
HE'S TEN TIMES WORSE THAN I
AND CAME BACK BUT LITTLE WISER THAN THEY WENT
THE NEXT OBJECT OF ASSAULT WAS ARTHUR WHO SAT OPPOSITE AND HAD NO DOUBT RICHLY ENJOYED THE WHOLE SCENE
MRS MARKHAM YES
BUT SHE HAS BID ADIEU TO ME AND I HAVE PROMISED NEVER TO GO NEAR THAT HOUSE AGAIN WHILE SHE INHABITS IT I COULD HAVE GROANED ALOUD AT THE BITTER THOUGHTS AWAKENED BY THIS TURN IN THE DISCOURSE
WHY DID HE LAUGH
I DON'T GO ONCE IN SIX WEEKS--WHAT DO YOU MEAN WELL BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TO DO WITH MRS GRAHAM WHY ROSE ARE YOU TOO GIVING IN TO THE PREVAILING OPINION NO RETURNED SHE HESITATINGLY--'BUT I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT HER LATELY BOTH AT THE WILSONS AND THE VICARAGE;--AND BESIDES MAMMA SAYS IF SHE WERE A PROPER PERSON SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING THERE BY HERSELF--AND DON'T YOU REMEMBER LAST WINTER GILBERT ALL THAT ABOUT THE FALSE NAME TO THE PICTURE
AND AS TO ABUSE AND ASPERSIONS WE ARE BOTH OF US FAR TOO DEEPLY ASHAMED OF THE ERRORS AND VICES OF OUR OTHER HALVES TO MAKE THEM THE COMMON SUBJECT OF OUR CORRESPONDENCE
HE HAD OFTEN SO DETERMINED BEFORE TO BE SURE AND AS OFTEN BROKEN HIS DETERMINATION
MOORLAND SCENE WITH WATER
I BROUGHT YOU HERE TO OFFER A PETITION IN HER BEHALF THAT THIS MAY BE HER HOME AS LONG AS SHE LIVES AND--IF IT BE NOT OUR HOME LIKEWISE--THAT I MAY OFTEN SEE HER AND BE WITH HER
THAT VOICE THE MAGIC OF WHOSE TONE CAN WAKE AN ECHO IN MY BREAST CREATING FEELINGS THAT ALONE CAN MAKE MY TRANCED SPIRIT BLEST
YOU HAVE NO LONGER ANY REGARD FOR ME IT APPEARS
OVER-CEREMONIOUS RATHER SAID HER NIECE--'OVER--WELL IT'S NO MATTER AND TURNING FROM ME SHE SEATED HERSELF IN A CHAIR BESIDE THE TABLE AND PULLING A BOOK TO HER BY THE COVER BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES IN AN ENERGETIC KIND OF ABSTRACTION
I SHALL NOT THINK ABOUT GOING TILL NEXT SPRING
AND HENCEFORTH I CAN NEVER TRUST HIS WORD
BUT DON'T LET THEM LAUGH OR GRUMBLE YOU OUT OF YOUR GOOD RESOLUTIONS OR YOUR AFFECTION FOR ME HE LAUGHED
BUT IT IS NOW JANUARY
TEARS BLIND ME WHILE I WRITE
AND MR HUNTINGDON LEANING OVER THE BANISTERS CALLED OUT GIVE MY LOVE TO ANNABELLA
AND WALTER YOU DOG YOU LOOK AS DEEP AND COOL AS IF YOU WERE CERTAIN OF SUCCESS AND AS KEEN AND CRUEL AS IF YOU WOULD DRAIN HER HEART'S BLOOD
BUT I MUST LEAVE THIS PLACE FREDERICK SHE SAID--'I NEVER CAN BE HAPPY HERE,--NOR ANYWHERE ELSE INDEED SHE ADDED WITH A MIRTHLESS LAUGH,--'BUT I CANNOT REST HERE BUT WHERE COULD YOU FIND A BETTER PLACE REPLIED HE SO SECLUDED--SO NEAR ME IF YOU THINK ANYTHING OF THAT YES INTERRUPTED SHE IT IS ALL I COULD WISH IF THEY COULD ONLY HAVE LEFT ME ALONE BUT WHEREVER YOU GO HELEN THERE WILL BE THE SAME SOURCES OF ANNOYANCE
YOU KNOW WHEN A LOT OF SERVANTS GETS TOGETHER THEY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR BETTERS
MY FATHER HAS GIVEN HIS CONSENT AND THE TIME IS FIXED FOR CHRISTMAS BY A SORT OF COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE RESPECTIVE ADVOCATES FOR HURRY AND DELAY
BUT SHE SAID SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED AT LAST TO GIVE HER SON IN CHARGE TO ESTHER HARGRAVE AS HER PRESENCE WAS SO CONSTANTLY REQUIRED IN THE SICK-ROOM THAT SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY ATTEND TO HIM HERSELF
AND THERE ARE MEDDLING FOOLS ELSEWHERE AS WELL AS HERE WHILE THUS CONVERSING THEY HAD SAUNTERED SLOWLY PAST ME DOWN THE WALK AND I HEARD NO MORE OF THEIR DISCOURSE
AND AT LENGTH HAVING CALLED UPON OUR MUSICIAN TO STRIKE UP A WALTZ I WAS JUST ABOUT TO WHIRL ELIZA ROUND IN THAT DELIGHTFUL DANCE ACCOMPANIED BY LAWRENCE AND JANE WILSON AND FERGUS AND ROSE WHEN MR MILLWARD INTERPOSED WITH:--'NO NO
LAWRENCE DIVINED MY ANXIOUS THOUGHTS AND APPRECIATED MY RESERVE
WHEN IT CEASED I LONGED FOR NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO BE OUT OF THE ROOM
IT MAY BE ONLY AN IGNIS FATUUS AFTER ALL BUT IT CAN DO NO HARM TO FOLLOW IT WITH MY EYES AND REJOICE IN ITS LUSTRE AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT LURE ME FROM THE PATH I OUGHT TO KEEP
AND HER COMPANY WOULD BE A SOOTHING SOLACE TO ME NOW
NOT ONE BIT BY ALL THAT'S SACRED HE REPLIED KISSING HER GLOWING CHEEK
NO ONE WILL BE DOWN TO BREAKFAST YET FOR LONG ENOUGH HE ANSWERED
I KNOW BUT LITTLE OF YOU MR HARGRAVE EXCEPT FROM REPORT HAVE YOU THEN FORGOTTEN THE SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS I SPENT UNDER YOUR ROOF LAST AUTUMN
BUT THIS MIGHT BE ONLY A REPORT
FOR WE HAD NOT MET FOR SOME TIME
HER ONLY REMARK ON THE SUBJECT IN MY HEARING WAS AND SO MR MARKHAM YOU ARE GOING TO ROB ME OF MY NIECE I UNDERSTAND
I HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE SAID I
MRS GRAHAM AND I ARE TWO FRIENDS--AND WILL BE
VEXATIOUS RATHER THAT I HAD BEEN FOOL ENOUGH TO WAIT SO LONG
MY UNCLE AND MR WILMOT ON THEIR SHOOTING PONIES MR HUNTINGDON AND LORD LOWBOROUGH ON THEIR LEGS
REASON FORBIDS BUT PASSION URGES STRONGLY
HAPPILY IT WAS GETTING LATE AND COULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE THE COMPANY DISPERSED
AND I PLAY AND SING TO HIM FOR HOURS TOGETHER
BUT I DID NOT MEAN THAT FREDERICK SHOULD BE THE MEANS OF TRANSMITTING MESSAGES BETWEEN US--ONLY THAT EACH MIGHT KNOW THROUGH HIM OF THE OTHER'S WELFARE;--AND MORE THAN THIS OUGHT NOT TO BE
BUT BEFORE I COULD SPEAK AGAIN THE LADY HERSELF WAS AT MY SIDE
AND I WISH YOU WOULDN'T MY DEAR CHILD I AM NOT
MY PAINTING MATERIALS WERE LAID TOGETHER ON THE CORNER TABLE READY FOR TO-MORROW'S USE AND ONLY COVERED WITH A CLOTH
I FEAR NO SUCH IDEA CROSSED HIS MIND
YOU'VE BEEN TO CALL ON THE WILSONS LAWRENCE SAID I AS I WALKED BESIDE HIS PONY
YOU MAY HAVE AS MANY WORDS AS YOU PLEASE,--ONLY I CAN'T STAY TO HEAR THEM NO
FOR SOME OF US HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO TALK ABOUT OUR NEIGHBOURS CONCERNS AND WE THE INDIGENOUS PLANTS OF THE SOIL HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER SO LONG AND TALKED EACH OTHER OVER SO OFTEN THAT WE ARE QUITE SICK OF THAT GAME
HE FLUNG THE DOOR TO WITH UNUSUAL VIOLENCE AND CAST HIS HAT ASIDE REGARDLESS WHERE IT FELL
AND I NEVER LOVED ANY OF THEM HALF AS MUCH AS I DO YOU SO YOU NEEDN'T FEAR TO BE FORSAKEN LIKE THEM IF YOU HAD TOLD ME THESE THINGS BEFORE ARTHUR I NEVER SHOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU THE CHANCE WOULDN'T YOU MY DARLING MOST CERTAINLY NOT HE LAUGHED INCREDULOUSLY
MRS GRAHAM FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER--NOT RACHEL BUT A YOUNG MAN SLENDER AND RATHER TALL
BUT IT IS NATURAL THAT YOU SHOULD BE GLAD TO GET RID OF ME
IT WAS AS IF I HAD SAID POUNDS NOT PENCE MUST BUY THE ARTICLE YOU WANT AND THEN HE SIGHED A QUERULOUS SELF-COMMISERATING SIGH AS IF IN PURE REGRET THAT HE THE LOVED AND COURTED OF SO MANY WORSHIPPERS SHOULD BE NOW ABANDONED TO THE MERCY OF A HARSH EXACTING COLD-HEARTED WOMAN LIKE THAT AND EVEN GLAD OF WHAT KINDNESS SHE CHOSE TO BESTOW
YET SOMETHING MUST BE DONE TO CHECK HIS PRESUMPTION--I WOULD NOT SUBMIT TO BE TYRANNISED OVER BY THOSE BRIGHT LAUGHING EYES
CHAPTER XXXV NINETEENTH.--IN PROPORTION AS LADY LOWBOROUGH FINDS SHE HAS NOTHING TO FEAR FROM ME AND AS THE TIME OF DEPARTURE DRAWS NIGH THE MORE AUDACIOUS AND INSOLENT SHE BECOMES
WE SHALL HAVE A LONG GAME AND YOU WILL GIVE ME SOME TROUBLE
BUT IT WAS NO USE
GOD HAS DESIGNED ME TO BE YOUR COMFORT AND PROTECTOR--I FEEL IT I KNOW IT AS CERTAINLY AS IF A VOICE FROM HEAVEN DECLARED YE TWAIN SHALL BE ONE FLESH"--AND YOU SPURN ME FROM YOU LET ME GO MR HARGRAVE SAID I STERNLY
AND WERE NOT THESE WORDS CONCEIVED IN HER MIND AND MANY OF THEM SPOKEN BY HER LIPS WELL SAID HE
I SAW THAT HE EXPECTED TO BE FURTHER QUESTIONED CONCERNING HIS VISIT AND I SAW TOO WITH THE KEEN PERCEPTION OF AWAKENED JEALOUSY OR ALARMED SELF-ESTEEM OR BY WHATEVER NAME I OUGHT TO CALL IT THAT HE RATHER SHRANK FROM THAT IMPENDING SCRUTINY AND WAS NO LESS PLEASED THAN SURPRISED TO FIND IT DID NOT COME
THE LATE RAIN HAD SO SWEETLY FRESHENED AND CLEARED THE AIR AND WASHED THE SKY AND LEFT SUCH GLITTERING GEMS ON BRANCH AND BLADE THAT NOT EVEN THE FARMERS COULD HAVE THE HEART TO BLAME IT
HE PUT HIS HAND TO HIS BROW AND PAUSED IN EVIDENT PERPLEXITY
PERHAPS I HAD NO RIGHT TO BE ANNOYED AT HIM BUT I WAS SO NEVERTHELESS
IT IS NOT MY IDEA OF BEING WELL MARRIED BUT SHE MEANS IT ALL FOR THE BEST
I'D GIVE WAY TO IT AND CRY RIGHT HARD
AND NOT WITHOUT REASON HE CONTINUED GENTLY DISENGAGING HIMSELF FROM MY GRASP
IF I WITHDRAW MY HAND FOR A MOMENT IT DISTRESSES HIM
AND FOR MY LITTLE ARTHUR--HAS HE NO FRIEND BUT ME
GILBERT THINKS SO I'M SURE VERY CONVENIENT DOCTRINE FOR US AT ALL EVENTS SAID I
AND THEN LITTLE ARTHUR SLEEPS SOUNDLY
BUT AS THE PRICELESS TREASURE TOO FREQUENTLY HIDES AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL IT NEEDS SOME COURAGE TO DIVE FOR IT ESPECIALLY AS HE THAT DOES SO WILL BE LIKELY TO INCUR MORE SCORN AND OBLOQUY FOR THE MUD AND WATER INTO WHICH HE HAS VENTURED TO PLUNGE THAN THANKS FOR THE JEWEL HE PROCURES
FOR THE BEAST WAS QUIET ENOUGH IN THE MAIN AND ONLY WINCED AND FLIRTED A TRIFLE TILL I GOT HOLD OF THE BRIDLE--BUT THEN I MUST SEE HIM IN THE SADDLE
A CLOUD OF ANGUISH DARKENED HER BROW A MARBLE PALENESS BLANCHED HER CHEEK AND LIP
BUT SCARCELY HAD HE PUT HIS FOOT IN THE STIRRUP WHEN A SICKNESS OR DIZZINESS SEEMED TO OVERPOWER HIM
AND YOU NEVER WILL KNOW GILBERT TILL YOU'RE MARRIED
SHE WILL TAKE IT AS A KIND ATTENTION AND THOUGH I HAVE LITTLE RELISH FOR HER SOCIETY SHE WILL BE TRULY WELCOME AS A THIRD TO STAND BETWEEN LADY LOWBOROUGH AND ME
BUT LET US SAY NO MORE OF HIM FOR THE PRESENT IF YOU PLEASE AT LAST THEY CAME
APT TO BE RATHER SULKY AT TIMES BUT QUIET AND COOL IN THE MAIN AND READY TO TAKE THINGS AS THEY COME THINK OF WHAT SHE WAS FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN YOU MARRIED HER AND WHAT SHE IS NOW I KNOW SHE WAS A LITTLE PLUMP LASSIE THEN WITH A PRETTY PINK AND WHITE FACE
ONLY SAID HE TO ME I MUST HAVE SOMEBODY THAT WILL LET ME HAVE MY OWN WAY IN EVERYTHING--NOT LIKE YOUR WIFE HUNTINGDON
THAT MEANS YES
IN THE COURSE OF THE FOLLOWING SIX WEEKS I MET HIM SEVERAL TIMES BUT ALWAYS SAVE ONCE IN COMPANY WITH HIS MOTHER OR HIS SISTER OR BOTH
SHORTLY AFTER THE COMPANY BROKE UP AND AS THE GUESTS WERE RETIRING TO THEIR ROOMS ARTHUR APPROACHED ME SMILING WITH THE UTMOST ASSURANCE
THE SILENCE MIGHT HAVE LASTED TILL ITS MASTER'S RETURN HAD IT DEPENDED ON ME TO BREAK IT
AND IF EVER FOR A MOMENT I HAVE SOUGHT TO DROWN THE VOICE OF REFLECTION IN MADNESS AND FOLLY OR IF I HAVE WASTED TOO MUCH OF MY TIME AND TALENTS AMONG RECKLESS AND DISSIPATED COMPANIONS GOD KNOWS I WOULD GLADLY RENOUNCE THEM ENTIRELY AND FOR EVER IF I HAD BUT HALF THE BLESSINGS THAT MAN SO THANKLESSLY CASTS BEHIND HIS BACK--BUT HALF THE INDUCEMENTS TO VIRTUE AND DOMESTIC ORDERLY HABITS THAT HE DESPISES--BUT SUCH A HOME AND SUCH A PARTNER TO SHARE IT
THEIR SOCIETY IS UNNECESSARY TO ME TO SAY THE LEAST AND THEIR CURIOSITY ANNOYS AND ALARMS ME
BUT WHEN I ALONE WAS THEIR OBJECT AS WAS FREQUENTLY THE CASE I ENDURED IT WITH CALM FORBEARANCE EXCEPT AT TIMES WHEN MY TEMPER WORN OUT BY REPEATED ANNOYANCES OR STUNG TO DISTRACTION BY SOME NEW INSTANCE OF IRRATIONALITY GAVE WAY IN SPITE OF MYSELF AND EXPOSED ME TO THE IMPUTATIONS OF FIERCENESS CRUELTY AND IMPATIENCE
I HAD JUST HAD ONE DANCE WITH AN EMPTY-HEADED COXCOMB AND THEN MR BOARHAM HAD COME UPON ME AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO CLING TO ME FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT
I GLANCED AT HIS MOTHER NOW AND THEN TO SEE HOW SHE RELISHED THE NEW-SPRUNG INTIMACY
BUT NOW--AT EVENING WHEN I SEE THE ROUND RED SUN SINK QUIETLY DOWN BEHIND THOSE WOODY HILLS LEAVING THEM SLEEPING IN A WARM RED GOLDEN HAZE I ONLY THINK ANOTHER LOVELY DAY IS LOST TO HIM AND ME
CAN YOU SWEAR THAT YOU WERE NOT THINKING OF ME WHILE YOU WEPT THIS WAS UNENDURABLE
THE PAIR HAD NOW APPROACHED WITHIN A FEW PACES OF US
SHE WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
THE MOTHERS WERE REPELLED BY HIS EMPTY COFFERS AND HIS REPUTATION FOR GAMBLING AND THE DAUGHTERS BY HIS CLOUDY BROW AND MELANCHOLY TEMPER--BESIDES HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THEM
AH HERE COMES ONE THAT WILL NOT REJOICE AT IT SHE MURMURED HALF TO HERSELF AS ARTHUR ENTERED THE ROOM
I WAS WELL-NIGH SINKING TO THE EARTH AND I ALMOST WONDERED HE DID NOT HEAR THE BEATING OF MY HEART ABOVE THE LOW SIGHING OF THE WIND AND THE FITFUL RUSTLE OF THE FALLING LEAVES
I THEREFORE VENTURED TO FOLLOW AND STAND BESIDE HER THERE,--BUT NOT TO SPEAK
DO YOU COME TOO WHEN YOU ARE SUFFICIENTLY COMPOSED TO APPEAR AS USUAL I AM SO NOW SPEAK GENTLY THEN AND DON'T LOOK SO MALICIOUS SAID MY CALM BUT PROVOKING AUNT
THERE IS ESSENTIAL GOODNESS IN HIM;--AND WHAT DELIGHT TO UNFOLD IT
AND I AM WEARY OF THIS LIFE
YOU HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HUNTINGDON LATELY HE SAID
AND I FEAR I AM SPOILING HIM
I AM NOT WELL I REPLIED
IT MUST BE A GROSS EXAGGERATION AT LEAST NO
BENSON TAKE THOSE THINGS AWAY SAID HE POINTING TO THE EASEL CANVAS AND STRETCHER
HE HAS NEVER ASKED ANY QUESTIONS OR SAID ANYTHING TO INVITE MY CONFIDENCE
FOR HIS MONEY WAS THE REPLY
THE DOCTOR HAS TOLD HIM THERE IS NO HOPE
HE CAST A SEARCHING GLANCE AT ME AS THE SERVANT WITHDREW EXPECTING TO SEE SOME TOKEN OF DEEP ASTONISHMENT AND ALARM
AND YOU OUGHT TO THANK ME FOR IT I ROSE AND RANG FOR THE NURSE
MAKE WHAT HASTE I WOULD I SHOULD STILL BE TOO LATE FOR TEA
YOU WON'T
A RICH OLD FRIEND OF MY UNCLE'S WHO I BELIEVE THOUGHT I COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN MARRY HIM
AND HE FAVOURED US ALL WITH A LONG AND MINUTE DISQUISITION UPON THE EVILS AND DANGERS ATTENDANT UPON DAMP FEET DELIVERED WITH THE MOST IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY AMID THE JEERS AND LAUGHTER OF MR HUNTINGDON AND MY UNCLE WHO LEAVING THE PRUDENT SPORTSMAN TO ENTERTAIN THE LADIES WITH HIS MEDICAL DISCUSSIONS SALLIED FORTH WITH THEIR GUNS BENDING THEIR STEPS TO THE STABLES FIRST TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE HORSES AND LET OUT THE DOGS
AND THE SHRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RESORTS SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER TEETH AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
AND AS FOR HIS WILDNESS SHE SUPPOSED HE WAS NO WORSE THAN OTHERS--BESIDES HE WAS REFORMED NOW
YET I COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS AT TIMES UNHAPPY AND DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF OR HER POSITION AND TRULY I MYSELF WAS NOT QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE LATTER
AND I WAS GLAD OF IT
BUT I WON'T STAY MANY MINUTES SHE SMILED UPON ME FAINTLY IT IS TRUE BUT MOST KINDLY--I HAD ALMOST SAID THANKFULLY AS HER APPREHENSIONS WERE REMOVED
THAT WAS THE VERY NAME IMPOSSIBLE MISS ELIZA I EXCLAIMED IN A TONE THAT MADE HER START
IT WOULD SERVE YOU RIGHT ANNABELLA SAID I AT LENGTH IF LORD LOWBOROUGH WERE TO RETURN TO HIS OLD HABITS WHICH HAD SO NEARLY EFFECTED HIS RUIN AND WHICH IT COST HIM SUCH AN EFFORT TO BREAK
WILL YOU NOT ENTER IT THEN IF YOU WISH IT CAN YOU DOUBT YES YES
I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING YOUR CHRISTIAN MAGNANIMITY SNEERED HE
BUT THE PENCIL FREQUENTLY LEAVES AN IMPRESSION UPON CARDBOARD THAT NO AMOUNT OF RUBBING CAN EFFACE
AND THIS TIME I SQUEEZED HER HAND WITH A CORDIAL NOT A SPITEFUL PRESSURE
AND OF COURSE I OUGHT TO BE MELTED TO TEARS OF PENITENCE AND ADMIRATION AT THE SIGHT OF SO MUCH GENEROSITY AND SUPERHUMAN GOODNESS
NOT LARGE BUT GOOD
HE PAUSED A MOMENT TO RECOVER THE SHOCK
GOD KNOWS HE WILL HAVE TEMPTATIONS ENOUGH TO ASSAIL HIM BOTH FROM WITHIN AND WITHOUT WHEN I HAVE DONE ALL I CAN TO RENDER VICE AS UNINVITING TO HIM AS IT IS ABOMINABLE IN ITS OWN NATURE--I MYSELF HAVE HAD INDEED BUT FEW INCENTIVES TO WHAT THE WORLD CALLS VICE BUT YET I HAVE EXPERIENCED TEMPTATIONS AND TRIALS OF ANOTHER KIND THAT HAVE REQUIRED ON MANY OCCASIONS MORE WATCHFULNESS AND FIRMNESS TO RESIST THAN I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN ABLE TO MUSTER AGAINST THEM
IT IS REPLIED I
I PLACED MY FINGER WHERE THE SIGNATURE WAS TO BE AND TOLD HIM HE MIGHT WRITE HIS NAME IN THE DARK IF HE ONLY KNEW WHERE TO PUT IT
HIS MERRIMENT SUDDENLY CEASING HE STARED IN MUTE AMAZEMENT AT THE CONSUMING TREASURE
IT TOOK THE WHOLE EIGHT MONTHS AND ALL HELEN'S KINDNESS AND GOODNESS TO BOOT TO OVERCOME MY MOTHER'S PREJUDICES AGAINST MY BRIDE-ELECT AND TO RECONCILE HER TO THE IDEA OF MY LEAVING LINDEN GRANGE AND LIVING SO FAR AWAY
AND ROSE WAS PRODUCING THE SUGAR-BASIN AND TEA-CADDY FROM THE CUPBOARD IN THE BLACK OAK SIDE-BOARD THAT SHONE LIKE POLISHED EBONY IN THE CHEERFUL PARLOUR TWILIGHT
IT WAS NOW HIGH TIME TO GO HOME SHE SAID AND WOULD HAVE BID ME GOOD-EVENING BUT I WAS NOT GOING TO LEAVE HER YET
IT SO HAPPENED HOWEVER THAT AFTER I LEFT YOU I TURNED BACK--DRAWN BY PURE DEPTH OF SYMPATHY AND ARDOUR OF AFFECTION--NOT DARING TO INTRUDE MY PRESENCE OPENLY UPON YOU BUT UNABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF CATCHING ONE GLIMPSE THROUGH THE WINDOW JUST TO SEE HOW YOU WERE
AND YOU HAD BETTER NOT TELL
AND AS FOR GAINING MONEY HITHERTO I HAVE ALWAYS HAD SUFFICIENT
HOW MUCH TO PITY AND HOW MUCH TO HATE;--AND WHAT WAS MORE I WOULD KNOW
THESE CONSIDERATIONS MADE MY HEART FLUTTER WITH ANXIETY AND MY CHEST HEAVE WITH IMPATIENCE TO GET THE CRISIS OVER
NOT YEARS FOR SHE'S ONLY FIVE-AND-TWENTY IT'S HER OWN DELICATE HEALTH AND CONFOUND IT MADAM
AND AS SOON AS I HAD TOLD HER ALL I THOUGHT PROPER--WHICH WAS ALL I AFFECTED TO KNOW--SHE FLEW WITH ALACRITY TO PUT ON HER BONNET AND SHAWL AND HASTEN TO CARRY THE GLAD TIDINGS TO THE MILLWARDS AND WILSONS--GLAD TIDINGS I SUSPECT TO NONE BUT HERSELF AND MARY MILLWARD--THAT STEADY SENSIBLE GIRL WHOSE STERLING WORTH HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY PERCEIVED AND DULY VALUED BY THE SUPPOSED MRS GRAHAM IN SPITE OF HER PLAIN OUTSIDE
IT WAS A KIND OF SERIOUS ALMOST SORROWFUL DISPLEASURE WHICH I SOON LEARNT CAREFULLY TO AVOID AWAKENING
BUT NEVERTHELESS I WOULD SOONER DIE THAN RELINQUISH HER IN FAVOUR OF THE BEST MAN THAT EVER WENT TO HEAVEN--AND AS FOR HER HAPPINESS I WOULD SACRIFICE MY BODY AND SOUL BODY AND SOUL MR HUNTINGDON--SACRIFICE YOUR SOUL WELL I WOULD LAY DOWN LIFE YOU WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO LAY IT DOWN I WOULD SPEND IT THEN--DEVOTE MY LIFE--AND ALL ITS POWERS TO THE PROMOTION AND PRESERVATION ANOTHER TIME SIR WE WILL TALK OF THIS--AND I SHOULD HAVE FELT DISPOSED TO JUDGE MORE FAVOURABLY OF YOUR PRETENSIONS IF YOU TOO HAD CHOSEN ANOTHER TIME AND PLACE AND LET ME ADD--ANOTHER MANNER FOR YOUR DECLARATION WHY YOU SEE MRS MAXWELL HE BEGAN PARDON ME SIR SAID SHE WITH DIGNITY--'THE COMPANY ARE INQUIRING FOR YOU IN THE OTHER ROOM AND SHE TURNED TO ME
ROSE HAS BEEN SHOPPING IN THE VILLAGE AND SHE'S HEARD THAT MR LAWRENCE HAS BEEN THROWN FROM HIS HORSE AND BROUGHT HOME DYING THIS SHOCKED ME A TRIFLE AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
AND THERE STOOD HE UPON THE STEPS CAREFULLY SUPERINTENDING THE DISLODGING OF HIS VARIOUS BOXES AND PACKAGES
BOTH SISTERS TAKE FOR THEIR MOTIVE THE EXILE'S LONGING THOUGHT OF HOME
GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW OFTEN I SHALL NEED IT IN THIS ROUGH DARK ROAD THAT LIES BEFORE ME
AND THOUGH MRS GRAHAM MIGHT BE EQUALLY OBJECTIONABLE I MAY BE PERMITTED LIKE THE DOCTORS TO CURE A GREATER EVIL BY A LESS FOR I SHALL NOT FALL SERIOUSLY IN LOVE WITH THE YOUNG WIDOW I THINK NOR SHE WITH ME--THAT'S CERTAIN--BUT IF I FIND A LITTLE PLEASURE IN HER SOCIETY I MAY SURELY BE ALLOWED TO SEEK IT
AND AFTER SHE WAS GONE ROSE INTERPRETED TO ME HER VARIOUS LOOKS WORDS AND ACTIONS WITH A MINGLED ACUTENESS AND ASPERITY THAT MADE ME WONDER EQUALLY AT THE LADY'S ARTIFICE AND MY SISTER'S PENETRATION AND ASK MYSELF IF SHE TOO HAD AN EYE TO THE SQUIRE--BUT NEVER MIND HALFORD
I CAN DO ALL THAT
SO THAT ALL I HAD TO DO WAS TO GET THINGS READY FOR HER RECEPTION
ONE WAS FROM MY BROTHER THE OTHER FROM MILICENT HARGRAVE WHO IS NOW IN LONDON WITH HER MOTHER
BUT THE MINUTE AFTER HE CHANGED HIS TONE AND ASKED WITH A SIGNIFICANT SMILE IF I HAD ANY MORE PORTRAITS NO REPLIED I REDDENING WITH CONFUSION AND WRATH
HE SAYS THERE'S NOT SUCH A JEWEL IN ALL ENGLAND AND SWEARS HE WOULDN'T TAKE A KINGDOM FOR HER BUT HE MAKES HER LIFE A CURSE TO HER NOT HE
I'LL ONLY SIT AND WATCH YOUR DRAWING OH BUT YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE THAT THEN I'LL CONTENT MYSELF WITH ADMIRING THIS MAGNIFICENT PROSPECT SHE MADE NO OBJECTION TO THIS
I DO NOT THINK EITHER OF THESE SOI-DISANT FRIENDS IS OVERFLOWING WITH LOVE FOR THE OTHER
OR WHAT WOULD YOU YOURSELF THINK IF HE OR ANY OTHER HAD ACTED THE SAME PART TO ME THROUGHOUT AS YOU HAVE TO ANNABELLA I WOULD BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT WELL THEN ARTHUR HOW CAN YOU CALL IT NOTHING--AN OFFENCE FOR WHICH YOU WOULD THINK YOURSELF JUSTIFIED IN BLOWING ANOTHER MAN'S BRAINS OUT
WHAT WIFE
THE SURPRISE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SO AGREEABLE AS IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
I HAVE SO LONG BEEN AWARE OF I PAUSED IN TIME AND ADDED OF MY HUSBAND'S CHARACTER THAT NOTHING SHOCKS ME BUT THIS--HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN AWARE OF THIS DEMANDED HE LAYING HIS CLENCHED HAND ON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM AND LOOKING ME KEENLY AND FIXEDLY IN THE FACE
AND DO YOU LIKE HIM ANNABELLA LIKE HIM
WHAT AILS YOU YOUNG WOMAN
FREDERICK SHOWED ME A LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THAT GENTLEMAN FULL OF COOL IMPUDENCE SUCH AS WOULD ASTONISH ANY ONE WHO DID NOT KNOW HIM BUT SUCH AS I AM CONVINCED NONE WOULD KNOW BETTER HOW TO ANSWER THAN MY BROTHER
ESPECIALLY IN SUCH A CASE AS THIS FOR ITS DREAD LAUGH OR ILL OPINION WOULD BE FAR MORE TERRIBLE TO HIM DIRECTED AGAINST HIS SISTER THAN HIMSELF
WHAT PLEASED HER BEST OF ALL WAS TO SEE HIM ROMPING AND RACING WITH SANCHO WHILE I WALKED BY HER SIDE--NOT I FEAR FOR LOVE OF MY COMPANY THOUGH I SOMETIMES DELUDED MYSELF WITH THAT IDEA SO MUCH AS FOR THE DELIGHT SHE TOOK IN SEEING HER SON THUS HAPPILY ENGAGED IN THE ENJOYMENT OF THOSE ACTIVE SPORTS SO INVIGORATING TO HIS TENDER FRAME YET SO SELDOM EXERCISED FOR WANT OF PLAYMATES SUITED TO HIS YEARS
BUT SHE COULD NOT GAIN HIS HEART
JUST IMAGINE YOURSELF IN MY PLACE
WELL I WOULD KNOW THE TRUTH
HE GOT INTO A BAD WAY AMONG US IN LONDON
AND PERHAPS I MAY MANAGE AS WELL
YOU WERE WISHING TO SEE MARMION MRS GRAHAM
AFTER ALL I THINK HE IS QUITE AS GOOD AS MR HUNTINGDON IF NOT BETTER
AND I NOW RESOLVED TO DO HIM A GOOD TURN THOUGH AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS FEELINGS AND PERHAPS AT THE RISK OF INCURRING THAT DISPLEASURE WHICH IS SO COMMONLY THE REWARD OF THOSE WHO GIVE DISAGREEABLE INFORMATION OR TENDER THEIR ADVICE UNASKED
HE TURNED AWAY MUTTERING SOME SENTENCE OF IMPATIENT CENSURE OR COMPLAINT IN WHICH HEARTLESS WAS THE ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE WORD
ONLY BE NOT TOO AUSTERE IN YOUR DIVINITY AND REMEMBER THAT I AM A POOR FALLIBLE MORTAL
AND SOMETIMES HE CONTRIVES TO ELUDE MY VIGILANCE AND SOMETIMES ACTS IN OPPOSITION TO MY WILL
THE SEEMING IMPRUDENCE OF THE MATCH HAS COST ME MANY AN ANXIOUS THOUGHT BY DAY AND MANY A SLEEPLESS HOUR BY NIGHT
ANNABELLA WILL EXCUSE US SAID SHE
HAD I NOT SEEN HER CONVERSED WITH HER TIME AFTER TIME
HAWORTH ENTHRONED UPON HIS MONSTROUS STEED AND SOLEMNLY PROCEEDING UP AND DOWN THE WIDE STEEP FIELD HE LOOKED THE VERY INCARNATION OF QUIET GLEEFUL SATISFACTION AND DELIGHT
ALREADY THE RAPID WALKING HAD SOMEWHAT MITIGATED MY EXCITEMENT
BUT I ASSURE YOU SHE IS AS ARTFUL A LITTLE HUSSY AS ANYBODY NEED WISH TO SEE
I AM IN NO HURRY AT ALL
SPRING JUST OPENING INTO SUMMER--MORNING JUST APPROACHING NOON--GIRLHOOD JUST RIPENING INTO WOMANHOOD AND HOPE JUST VERGING ON FRUITION
IT'S AN ACT OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY WHEREBY YOU HOPE TO GAIN A HIGHER SEAT IN HEAVEN FOR YOURSELF AND SCOOP A DEEPER PIT IN HELL FOR ME NO
WOULD YOU BE VERY GLAD RESUMED SHE TO FIND THAT YOU WERE MISTAKEN IN YOUR CONCLUSIONS HOW CAN YOU ASK IT HELEN I DON'T SAY I CAN CLEAR MYSELF ALTOGETHER SAID SHE SPEAKING LOW AND FAST WHILE HER HEART BEAT VISIBLY AND HER BOSOM HEAVED WITH EXCITEMENT,--'BUT WOULD YOU BE GLAD TO DISCOVER I WAS BETTER THAN YOU THINK ME ANYTHING THAT COULD IN THE LEAST DEGREE TEND TO RESTORE MY FORMER OPINION OF YOU TO EXCUSE THE REGARD I STILL FEEL FOR YOU AND ALLEVIATE THE PANGS OF UNUTTERABLE REGRET THAT ACCOMPANY IT WOULD BE ONLY TOO GLADLY TOO EAGERLY RECEIVED HER CHEEKS BURNED AND HER WHOLE FRAME TREMBLED NOW WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION
THEN HOW COULD YOU PERMIT I COULDN'T HELP IT AUNT I CRIED BURSTING INTO TEARS
I SOMETIMES FEAR SHE'LL OVERCOME ME AFTER ALL
AND WHEN HE HAD SET THE TABLE IN A ROAR HE WOULD LOOK ROUND DELIGHTEDLY UPON THEM ALL AND ADD HIS SHRILL LAUGH TO THEIRS
YOU MAY GO TO THE D--L IF YOU CHOOSE--AND SAY I SENT YOU BUT BEFORE I ABANDONED HIM TO HIS FATE I FLUNG HIS PONY'S BRIDLE OVER A STAKE IN THE HEDGE AND THREW HIM MY HANDKERCHIEF AS HIS OWN WAS NOW SATURATED WITH BLOOD
AND I KNOW THERE IS TRUTH AND SENSE IN WHAT YOU SAY
A PENALTY I MIGHT BRAVE IF I WERE CERTAIN SHE LOVED ME
BLAKE HALL--FRONT GRASSDALE MANOR THEN I WILL STAY WITH YOU SAID I
NOW HUNTINGDON YOU SEE SAID HATTERSLEY
I NEVER SAW HER SPEAK MUCH TO MR HUNTINGDON
DO TELL ME HER CHEEK WAS BLANCHED WITH THE VERY ANGUISH OF ANXIETY--COULD IT BE WITH THE FEAR THAT I HAD RASHLY PLEDGED MY FAITH TO ANOTHER
BILBERRY-PLANTS AND HEATHER--RELICS OF MORE SAVAGE WILDNESS--GREW UNDER THE WALLS
DO YOU REALLY WISH IT MOST CERTAINLY I DO
THE DAY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL HOWEVER HE SURPRISED ME BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN INTENTION TO PROCURE A GOVERNESS FOR LITTLE ARTHUR
AND PERHAPS HER PLEASURE WAS SWEETENED NOT A LITTLE BY THE FACT OF MY BEING WITH HER INSTEAD OF WITH HIM AND THEREFORE INCAPABLE OF DOING HIM ANY INJURY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY DESIGNEDLY OR OTHERWISE SMALL THANKS TO HER FOR THAT SAME
HE WAS AMAZED ASTOUNDED AT SUCH AN ANSWER BUT TOO INCREDULOUS TO BE MUCH OFFENDED
I SHALL MEET THEM THERE AND TELL HIM I WANT A BIT OF TALK WITH HIM ABOUT SOME THINGS THAT WE NEEDN'T TROUBLE THE LADY WITH
HE IS COME ON A VERY IMPORTANT ERRAND--TO ASK YOUR HAND IN MARRIAGE OF YOUR UNCLE AND ME I HOPE MY UNCLE AND YOU TOLD HIM IT WAS NOT IN YOUR POWER TO GIVE IT
AND DOES HE LOVE YOU--I MEAN DOES HE IDOLISE YOU AS MUCH AS YOU DO HIM SHE ADDED FIXING HER EYES UPON ME WITH ILL-DISGUISED ANXIETY FOR THE REPLY
IN THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE FOOTMAN'S CLOSING THE DOOR AND TAKING HIS PLACE BEHIND SHE RAISED HER SMILING BROWN EYES TO HIS FACE OBSERVING PLAYFULLY,--'I FEAR YOU MUST THINK ME VERY INSENSIBLE FREDERICK
MY SPIRIT SHALL BE ALWAYS WITH YOU AND SOMETIMES YOU SHALL SEE ME WITH YOUR BODILY EYE
AND IF IT IS AND IF HE DO ANNOY ME IT SHALL BE FOR THE LAST TIME I AM DETERMINED IF THERE BE POWER IN WORDS AND LOOKS AGAINST COOL IMPUDENCE AND MAWKISH SENTIMENTALITY SO INEXHAUSTIBLE AS HIS THE HORSE SOON OVERTOOK ME AND WAS REINED UP CLOSE BESIDE ME
I HAD NO SUFFICIENT EXCUSE TO OFFER AND I PROMISED IF ALL WERE WELL HE SHOULD SEE ME IN MY PEW NEXT SUNDAY
FOR HE KEEPS IT WITH HIM CONFINED AMID THE DUST AND SMOKE OF LONDON--PERHAPS SHUT UP WITHIN THE WALLS OF HIS OWN ABOMINABLE CLUB
I DID SO AND THE ANSWERS I RECEIVED WERE ALWAYS PROVOKINGLY LIMITED TO THE LETTER OF THE INQUIRY
DOUBTLESS HE HAD MADE HIS FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER--HIS FIRST INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE AT LEAST--DURING HIS THREE MONTHS SOJOURN AT F FOR I NOW RECOLLECTED THAT HE HAD ONCE CASUALLY LET FALL AN INTIMATION THAT HIS AUNT AND SISTER HAD A YOUNG FRIEND STAYING WITH THEM AT THE TIME AND THIS ACCOUNTED FOR AT LEAST ONE-HALF HIS SILENCE ABOUT ALL TRANSACTIONS THERE
HE NOW STEPPED UP TO ANNABELLA WHO SAT WITH HER BACK TOWARDS HIM WITH HATTERSLEY STILL BESIDE HER THOUGH NOT NOW ATTENDING TO HER BEING OCCUPIED IN VOCIFEROUSLY ABUSING AND BULLYING HIS HOST
WILL YOU TELL ARTHUR THAT I SHALL COME IN A FEW MINUTES IF THAT BE THE CASE I WILL WAIT WITH YOUR PERMISSION TILL THOSE FEW MINUTES ARE PAST
I LOOKED AT MY COMPANION TO SEE WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF THIS GLORIOUS SCENE
CHAPTER XLV WELL HALFORD WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ALL THIS
NO TRUE CHRISTIAN COULD CHERISH SUCH BITTER FEELINGS AS I DO AGAINST HIM AND HER ESPECIALLY THE LATTER
I HAVE NEED OF CONSOLATION IN MY SON FOR TO THIS SILENT PAPER I MAY CONFESS IT I HAVE BUT LITTLE IN MY HUSBAND
BUT I COULD NOT THEN REGARD THE MATTER IN SUCH A MODERATE LIGHT
YES POOR ARTHUR I WILL STILL HOPE AND PRAY FOR YOU
I WAS TOO MUCH HURT TO EXPRESS ANY FURTHER DISSATISFACTION WITH HIS PLANS OR AT ALL TO REFER TO THE SUBJECT AGAIN EXCEPT FOR THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS CONCERNING HIS DEPARTURE AND THE CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS DURING HIS ABSENCE TILL THE DAY BEFORE HE WENT WHEN I EARNESTLY EXHORTED HIM TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF AND KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
LITTLE WAS SAID BY EITHER PARTY IN THE CARRIAGE DURING OUR SHORT TRANSIT HOMEWARDS
AND YET HE CLINGS TO ME WITH UNRELENTING PERTINACITY--WITH A KIND OF CHILDISH DESPERATION AS IF I COULD SAVE HIM FROM THE FATE HE DREADS
THAT LADY'S COOL DISTANT MANNERS RATHER CHILLED ME AT FIRST
FOR AS I APPROACHED I BEHELD AT NO GREAT DISTANCE MRS GRAHAM AND HER SON COMING DOWN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
BESIDES DEAR HELEN SAID HE EMBRACING ME WITH FLATTERING FONDNESS I CANNOT SPARE YOU FOR A SINGLE DAY THEN HOW HAVE YOU MANAGED WITHOUT ME THESE MANY DAYS SAID I
NEVERTHELESS THEY BORE IT VERY WELL BEING ALL IN THEIR HOLIDAY HUMOURS
BUT STILL HE CANNOT TRUST OR WILL NOT COMPREHEND THEM
WHEN SHE SINGS AND PLAYS TO HIM AND HE HANGS OVER THE INSTRUMENT AND DWELLS UPON HER VOICE WITH NO AFFECTED INTEREST
DO COME IN AND TAKE YOUR SUPPER
LET ME FINISH:--YOU DON'T KNOW THAT IF YOU MARRIED HER YOUR HOME WOULD BE RAYLESS AND COMFORTLESS
BUT INDEED I HAD A HARD TIME OF IT SAID SHE
FOR--IT MAY BE FOOLISH WEAKNESS BUT I AM UNDER SUCH CONSTANT DREAD OF HIS BEING SNATCHED AWAY THAT I AM NEVER EASY WHEN HE IS NOT BY MY SIDE
BUT I DID MY BEST TO PROPITIATE HER AND NOT ENTIRELY WITHOUT SUCCESS I THINK EVEN IN THAT FIRST SHORT VISIT
MEANTIME HARGRAVE VOLUNTEERED TO RING FOR THE SUGAR WHILE GRIMSBY LAMENTED HIS MISTAKE AND ATTEMPTED TO PROVE THAT IT WAS OWING TO THE SHADOW OF THE URN AND THE BADNESS OF THE LIGHTS
BUT I AM WELL ASSURED SHE HAS NOT YET FORGOTTEN OR FORGIVEN EITHER HER FORMER LOVER OR THE LADY WHOSE SUPERIOR QUALITIES FIRST OPENED HIS EYES TO THE FOLLY OF HIS BOYISH ATTACHMENT
AND IMMEDIATELY I ROSE AND ADVANCED TO TAKE LEAVE WITH A MOST HEROIC RESOLUTION--BUT PRIDE WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT OR IT COULD NOT HAVE CARRIED ME THROUGH
AS IN LIKE MANNER SHE WHO UNDERTAKES THE CLEANSING OF A CARELESS BACHELOR'S APARTMENT WILL BE LIABLE TO MORE ABUSE FOR THE DUST SHE RAISES THAN COMMENDATION FOR THE CLEARANCE SHE EFFECTS
SHE SAID NOTHING
I LAID THE MUSIC ON THE PIANO AND RETIRED
HE LEANT FORWARD A MOMENT WITH HIS HEAD DROOPED ON THE ANIMAL'S BACK AND THEN MADE ONE MORE EFFORT WHICH PROVING INEFFECTUAL HE SANK BACK ON THE BANK WHERE I LEFT HIM REPOSING HIS HEAD ON THE OOZY TURF AND TO ALL APPEARANCE AS CALMLY RECLINING AS IF HE HAD BEEN TAKING HIS REST ON HIS SOFA AT HOME
CHAPTER XVII THE NEXT DAY I ACCOMPANIED MY UNCLE AND AUNT TO A DINNER-PARTY AT MR WILMOT'S
THEN THROUGH HER MEANS I WOULD PRIVATELY SELL WHAT PICTURES I HAD ON HAND THAT WOULD DO FOR SUCH A PURPOSE AND SOME OF THOSE I SHOULD THEREAFTER PAINT
BUT I THINK IF I WAS YOU MISS HELEN I'D LOOK VERY WELL BEFORE I LEAPED
HE HAD BEEN SILENT A LONG TIME AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER SPEAK AGAIN WHEN HE MURMURED FAINTLY BUT DISTINCTLY,--'PRAY FOR ME HELEN I DO PRAY FOR YOU EVERY HOUR AND EVERY MINUTE ARTHUR
AND MEANTIME I GROW INSUPPORTABLY MOROSE AND MISANTHROPICAL FROM THE IDEA THAT EVERY ONE I MET WAS HARBOURING UNWORTHY THOUGHTS OF THE SUPPOSED MRS GRAHAM AND WOULD EXPRESS THEM IF HE DARED
BUT INDEED YOU ARE NOT
THE FIRST THING MR HUNTINGDON DID WAS TO WALK UP TO ANNABELLA
SOME DAY I MAY TELL YOU BUT AT PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME
SHE KNOWS ALL THE FOLLY AND ALL THE WICKEDNESS OF MY FORMER LIFE AND IS NOT AFRAID TO TRUST ME--AND MY RANK AND TITLE ARE NO ALLUREMENTS TO HER
BUT HIS SISTER AND I REMAINED SILENT AND GRAVE
IN THE THIRD PLACE I DON'T SEE TO-MORROW'S BANQUET AND HOW CAN I TELL THAT IT IS NOT ALL A FABLE GOT UP BY THE GREASY-FACED FELLOW THAT IS ADVISING ME TO ABSTAIN IN ORDER THAT HE MAY HAVE ALL THE GOOD VICTUALS TO HIMSELF
SHE HONOURED ME WITH ANOTHER OF HER HARD INHOSPITABLE LOOKS IN DEPARTING BUT LITTLE MOVED THEREBY I WENT ON TALKING
NOT OF LIVING WITHOUT YOUR MOCKERY OF LOVE
ADVANCING THENCE HE ANSWERED WITH A CARELESS LAUGH WELL DEAREST I COULDN'T HELP IT
IT IS WHAT EVERY RESPECTABLE FEMALE OUGHT TO KNOW;--AND BESIDES THOUGH YOU ARE ALONE NOW YOU WILL NOT BE ALWAYS SO
WHEN MY AMBITIOUS INTENTIONS WERE MADE KNOWN TO HER SHE TOOK IT MORE SENSIBLY THAN I HAD VENTURED TO HOPE
MY SENSES SEEMED TO FAIL ME BUT STILL I SAW HIS SHADOWY FORM PASS BEFORE ME AND THROUGH THE RUSHING SOUND IN MY EARS I DISTINCTLY HEARD HIM SAY AS HE STOOD LOOKING UP THE LAWN,--'THERE GOES THE FOOL
BUT WHEN ANYTHING VERY EXTRAORDINARY WAS SAID OR DONE BY THE INFANT PROFLIGATE I NOTICED AT TIMES A PECULIAR EXPRESSION IN HIS FACE THAT I COULD NEITHER INTERPRET NOR DEFINE
I HAVE LITTLE ENOUGH TO DO WITH HER MYSELF
BUT I WAS COMFORTED TO HEAR THAT HE HAD FRIGHTFULLY FRACTURED HIS SKULL AND BROKEN A LEG
GOD HAS SENT ME A SOUL TO EDUCATE FOR HEAVEN AND GIVE ME A NEW AND CALMER BLISS AND STRONGER HOPES TO COMFORT ME
AND I MAY TELL YOU TOO THAT SHE SEEMED TO BE FAR MORE ANXIOUS LEST YOU SHOULD THINK TOO MUCH OF HER THAN LEST YOU SHOULD FORGET HER SHE WAS RIGHT BUT I FEAR YOUR ANXIETY IS QUITE THE OTHER WAY RESPECTING HER NO IT IS NOT
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE A PART OF MYSELF
I FLEW ACROSS THE FIELD LEAPED THE STONE FENCE AND THEN WALKED DOWN THE LANE TO MEET HIM
NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE HIS ANGUISH
ANOTHER MUST MAKE AMENDS FOR YOUR PAST DELINQUENCIES
NOW HOWEVER THE CAUSE OF THAT OMISSION WAS EXPLAINED THOUGH NOT ENTIRELY TO THE SATISFACTION OF ROSE
THIS ONE HE WAS QUITE WILLING TO SUBMIT TO MY LONGING GAZE
OR HE THAT BELIEVETH WITH AN INFIDEL HE IS NOT AN INFIDEL;--AND I AM NOT LIGHT AND HE IS NOT DARKNESS
AND HAVING POLITELY GREETED THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY HE SEATED HIMSELF QUITE ALOOF FROM THE YOUNG WIDOW BETWEEN MY MOTHER AND ROSE
HER NAME IS MYERS I BELIEVE
WHAT ARE YOU SIR THAT YOU SHOULD SET YOURSELF UP AS A GOD AND PRESUME TO DISPUTE POSSESSION OF MY HEART WITH HIM TO WHOM I OWE ALL I HAVE AND ALL I AM EVERY BLESSING I EVER DID OR EVER CAN ENJOY--AND YOURSELF AMONG THE REST--IF YOU ARE A BLESSING WHICH I AM HALF INCLINED TO DOUBT DON'T BE SO HARD UPON ME HELEN
WILL THAT DO WALTER ADDED THE SAUCY GIRL TURNING TO HIM AND PUTTING HER ARM ROUND HIS NECK AS HE STOOD LEANING UPON THE SILL OF THE WINDOW--'OR SHOULD I HAVE SAID THAT YOU ARE SORRY YOU WERE SO TOUCHY
SUPPOSE I DID
IT WAS FOR JOY TO FIND THAT YOU HAD SOME DEPTH OF SOUL AND FEELING AFTER ALL AND TO HOPE THAT I HAD NOT BEEN UTTERLY MISTAKEN IN YOUR WORTH
WHILE I STOOD AT THE WINDOW CONVERSING WITH MILICENT HE CAME UP TO ME AND WAS BEGINNING TO TALK IN NEARLY HIS USUAL STRAIN WHEN MR HUNTINGDON ENTERED THE ROOM
BUT HOPED I WOULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT UNLESS CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD RENDER IT REALLY NECESSARY WHICH I WAS READY ENOUGH TO PROMISE
DO YOU THINK I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF MYSELF YOU DIDN'T LAST TIME
I HAVE TRUSTED TO THE TESTIMONY OF NO THIRD PERSON
HAD THEIR UNKINDNESS THEN REALLY DRIVEN HER TO SEEK FOR PEACE IN SOLITUDE
BUT WHEN YOU TELL HER WILL YOU JUST SAY THAT I DEEPLY REGRET IT AND OH NEVER FEAR
AND AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION UPON INDIFFERENT TOPICS I WENT AWAY SUFFERING ALL THE PANGS OF WOUNDED PRIDE AND INJURED FRIENDSHIP IN ADDITION TO THOSE RESULTING FROM THE FEAR THAT I WAS INDEED FORGOTTEN AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE I LOVED WAS ALONE AND AFFLICTED SUFFERING FROM INJURED HEALTH AND DEJECTED SPIRITS AND I WAS FORBIDDEN TO CONSOLE OR ASSIST HER
TURNING TOWARDS ME AND ATTENTIVELY SURVEYING MY FACE BY THE DIM LIGHT HE SAID IN A MILDER TONE THAN HE HAD YET EMPLOYED,--'YOU TOO HAVE SUFFERED I SUPPOSE I SUFFERED MUCH AT FIRST WHEN WAS THAT TWO YEARS AGO
AND IF FOR DUTY'S SAKE SHE HAD NOT MADE EVERY EFFORT TO LOVE HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE HATED HIM TO THE END OF HER DAYS
BUT MR HUNTINGDON HAD LINGERED BEHIND THE REST
BUT ISN'T IT STRANGE MAMMA STRANGE
THERE IS A CHANGE
ROSE AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
AND SHE WASN'T HIS OWN NIECE NEITHER
AND DID YOU FIND NO PASSAGES TENDING TO PROVE THE DANGER AND THE FALSITY OF SUCH A BELIEF NO
AND THEN I HAD EYES AND EARS FOR NOBODY ELSE
FOR THOUGH I MUST PLEAD GUILTY TO HAVING DISFIGURED THE BACKS OF SEVERAL WITH ABORTIVE ATTEMPTS TO DELINEATE THAT TOO FASCINATING PHYSIOGNOMY I WAS SURE THAT WITH THAT ONE UNFORTUNATE EXCEPTION I HAD CAREFULLY OBLITERATED ALL SUCH WITNESSES OF MY INFATUATION
I RETURNED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM WHERE DOUBTLESS MY PRESENCE WOULD BE EXPECTED BY MOST DESIRED BY ONE OR TWO
IF I AM TO BE MR HATTERSLEY'S WIFE I MUST TRY TO LOVE HIM
I CAME TO HER HOUSE AS OFTEN AS I DARED
OR ON FINE MOONLIGHT NIGHTS IN ROAMING ABOUT THE GROUNDS
I THOUGHT SO NOBLE A CREATURE WOULD HAVE POWER TO ATTACH YOU FOR A YEAR AT LEAST I WOULD RATHER NOT SPEAK OF HER NOW AH
I NEED NOT DILATE UPON THE FEELINGS WITH WHICH I APPROACHED THE SHRINE OF MY FORMER DIVINITY--THAT SPOT TEEMING WITH A THOUSAND DELIGHTFUL RECOLLECTIONS AND GLORIOUS DREAMS--ALL DARKENED NOW BY ONE DISASTROUS TRUTH RACHEL ADMITTED ME INTO THE PARLOUR AND WENT TO CALL HER MISTRESS FOR SHE WAS NOT THERE
IT IS A HATEFUL IDEA BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE IT IS A FALSE ONE
THEN SHE GLANCED AT ME SIMPERED A LITTLE AND BLUSHED MODESTLY LOOKED AT HER PRAYER-BOOK AND ENDEAVOURED TO COMPOSE HER FEATURES
WELL HELEN HOW DO YOU LIKE MR BOARHAM NOW SAID MY AUNT AS WE TOOK OUR SEATS IN THE CARRIAGE AND DROVE AWAY
STILL LESS CAN I NOW COMPREHEND HOW IT SHOULD KEEP HIM A MONTH FOR IT IS NEARLY THAT TIME SINCE I LEFT HIM AND NO SIGNS OF HIS RETURN AS YET
DEVIL TAKE HER HE CRIED A MOMENT AFTER AND YOU TOO
THINGS THAT FORMERLY SHOCKED AND DISGUSTED ME NOW SEEM ONLY NATURAL
HE TOOK IT AND CAST IT BACK TO ME IN ABHORRENCE AND CONTEMPT WITH ALL THE STRENGTH HE COULD MUSTER
TO-MORROW I WILL SEE HER ONCE AGAIN AND KNOW SOMETHING MORE ABOUT HER
HOW DIFFERENTLY I USED TO FEEL HIS ABSENCE
ARRIVED AT THE HALL-DOOR I PAUSED ON THE STEPS AND LOOKED ROUND ME WAITING TO RECOVER MY COMPOSURE IF POSSIBLE--OR AT ANY RATE TO REMEMBER MY NEW-FORMED RESOLUTIONS AND THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THEY WERE FOUNDED
BUT ERE LONG THEIR DEXTERITY BECAME IMPAIRED THEY BEGAN TO HESITATE TO TREMBLE SLIGHTLY AND MAKE FALSE STROKES AND THEN SUDDENLY CAME TO A PAUSE WHILE THEIR OWNER LAUGHINGLY RAISED HER FACE TO MINE AND TOLD ME THAT HER SKETCH DID NOT PROFIT BY MY SUPERINTENDENCE
WHEN I ENTERED MY ROOM I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE ANNABELLA WILMOT STANDING BEFORE MY TOILET-TABLE COMPOSEDLY SURVEYING HER FEATURES IN THE GLASS WITH ONE HAND FLIRTING HER GOLD-MOUNTED WHIP AND THE OTHER HOLDING UP HER LONG HABIT
SILENCE AGAIN
AND MEANTIME HE HAD BEEN QUIETLY PROCEEDING WITH HIS OWN AFFAIRS
IT WAS ON A PLEASANT EVENING AT THE CLOSE OF MAY
WHY COULDN'T THEY ENJOY THE FLOWERS AND SUNSHINE OF THE OPEN GARDEN AND LEAVE THAT SUNLESS NOOK TO ME AND THE GNATS AND MIDGES
AFTER DINNER I RETIRED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM AS USUAL AND SHE ACCOMPANIED ME BUT I HAD THE TWO CHILDREN WITH ME AND I GAVE THEM MY WHOLE ATTENTION AND DETERMINED TO KEEP THEM TILL THE GENTLEMEN CAME OR TILL MILICENT ARRIVED WITH HER MOTHER
IT IS ONLY ANXIETY FOR HIM THAT SHE EXPRESSES
I NEVER HAD OCCASION TO TRY IT
BUT WHEN HE HAD GOT IT HE CONDESCENDED TO CAST A GLANCE OVER MY PICTURE
I CAN'T BE QUIET WHILE I SEE YOU WALKING THERE I COMPLIED
I TOOK HER HAND AND VIOLENTLY DASHED IT FROM ME WITH AN EXPRESSION OF ABHORRENCE AND INDIGNATION THAT COULD NOT BE SUPPRESSED
I CAN DO NO MORE THAN OFFER RESTITUTION CAN I BUT LOWBOROUGH HAD GAINED THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND WAS NOW CROSSING THE HALL
AFTER HIS CUSTOMARY CHEERFUL AND FATHERLY GREETING OF ROSE WHO WAS RATHER A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE TURNED SOMEWHAT STERNLY TO ME WELL SIR SAID HE YOU'RE QUITE A STRANGER
BUT STILL WITH HAND AND EYE SHE SILENTLY CALLED HIM TO HER SIDE
HE LIES ON THE SOFA NEARLY ALL DAY LONG
THAT NIGHT THERE CAME A HEAVY FALL OF SNOW WHICH SO RETARDED THE PROGRESS OF THE COACHES ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THAT I WAS ALMOST DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION
BUT I THOUGHT YOU ALWAYS LIKED TO BE YIELDED TO AND I CAN'T ALTER NOW I DO LIKE IT REPLIED HE BRINGING HER TO HIM BY ANOTHER TUG AT HER HAIR
NOT BECAUSE YOU LOVED HER ARTHUR MIND BUT BECAUSE SHE INJURED YOU AND DECEIVED HER HUSBAND AND WAS ALTOGETHER A VERY ABOMINABLE WOMAN WHOM YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED TO MENTION BUT HE DEFENDED HER BY SAYING THAT SHE HAD A DOTING OLD HUSBAND WHOM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOVE
HIS APPREHENSIONS ARE MORE QUICK HIS HEART MORE OVERFLOWING WITH AFFECTION THAN EVER HIS FATHER'S COULD HAVE BEEN AND IT IS NO HOPELESS TASK TO BEND HIM TO OBEDIENCE AND WIN HIM TO LOVE AND KNOW HIS OWN TRUE FRIEND AS LONG AS THERE IS NO ONE TO COUNTERACT MY EFFORTS
BUT A PARENT'S AUTHORITY CANNOT LAST FOR EVER
DO YOU KNOW WHAT MR LAWRENCE IS GONE FOR SHE LOOKED UP ANXIOUSLY FOR MY REPLY
HAVE YOU LOOKED IT OVER SHE MURMURED
IT'S MAMMA'S FRIEND SAID ARTHUR
HIS DARK GREENISH EYES WERE LIGHTED UP BENEATH THEIR MOODY BROWS
IF SO YOU MUST TELL HER THAT MY PROPERTY IS MOSTLY ENTAILED AND I CANNOT GET RID OF IT
THE WORD FRIEND IN HIS MOUTH MAKES ME SHUDDER
IN ANOTHER THE CRIMSON HANDKERCHIEF SOAKING IN A DEEPLY TINCTURED POOL OF WATER--FOR MUCH RAIN HAD FALLEN IN THE INTERIM
HE DID NOT LOOK AT US BUT ON HEARING MY EARNEST REQUEST HE PAUSED IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE TO LISTEN FOR HER REPLY AND WENT ON WITH A LOOK OF QUIET SATISFACTION THE MOMENT HE FOUND IT WAS TO BE A DENIAL
I HAVE NOW BEEN HERE NEARLY A FORTNIGHT AND BUT FOR ONE DISTURBING CARE THE HAUNTING DREAD OF DISCOVERY I AM COMFORTABLY SETTLED IN MY NEW HOME
GROWN
SHE EARNESTLY ENDEAVOURED TO DISSUADE MY UNCLE FROM ASKING HIM
BUT ON DUE REFLECTION I CONSIDERED THAT IF IT WERE KNOWN TO THEM IT COULD NOT LONG REMAIN A SECRET TO THE MILLWARDS AND WILSONS AND SUCH WAS MY PRESENT APPRECIATION OF ELIZA MILLWARD'S DISPOSITION THAT IF ONCE SHE GOT A CLUE TO THE STORY I SHOULD FEAR SHE WOULD SOON FIND MEANS TO ENLIGHTEN MR HUNTINGDON UPON THE PLACE OF HIS WIFE'S RETREAT
BUT WHILE I WAS ASSURING HER THAT I HAD NO WISH TO JOIN THEM AND WAS NOT TIRED MR HUNTINGDON HIMSELF CAME UP TO THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE AT WHICH WE SAT
HARD WORK THAT MUST BE DONE
HE HAS MANY GOOD QUALITIES
AND SOMETIMES I READ TO HIM AND SOMETIMES I TALK AND SOMETIMES ONLY SIT BY HIM AND SOOTHE HIM WITH SILENT CARESSES
AND THAT IT TENDS TO RENDER HIM IMBECILE IN BODY AND MIND
AND IF AT PRESENT HE PREFERS THE SOCIETY OF HIS FRIENDS TO THAT OF HIS WIFE AND THE DISSIPATIONS OF THE TOWN TO THE QUIET OF COUNTRY LIFE I SUPPOSE I HAVE THOSE FRIENDS TO THANK FOR IT
THE QUESTION WAS NOT BROACHED BETWEEN US
BUT THEN I KNOW HIS HEART IS STILL UNCHANGED
YOU CHOOSE RATHER TO LEAVE US MISERABLE
BUT DEATH WILL COME--IT IS COMING NOW--FAST FAST!--AND--OH IF I COULD BELIEVE THERE WAS NOTHING AFTER DON'T TRY TO BELIEVE IT ARTHUR
RESPECTING THE AUTHOR'S IDENTITY I WOULD HAVE IT TO BE DISTINCTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT ACTON BELL IS NEITHER CURRER NOR ELLIS BELL AND THEREFORE LET NOT HIS FAULTS BE ATTRIBUTED TO THEM
ISN'T SHE CROSS WHISPERED SHE TO ME
AND A SIMPLE BUT STRIKING LITTLE PICTURE OF A CHILD BROODING WITH LOOKS OF SILENT BUT DEEP AND SORROWFUL REGRET OVER A HANDFUL OF WITHERED FLOWERS WITH GLIMPSES OF DARK LOW HILLS AND AUTUMNAL FIELDS BEHIND IT AND A DULL BECLOUDED SKY ABOVE
ARTHUR UTTERED A LOW WHISTLE AND FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES
HE THINKS I DISLIKE HIM AND HE MUST CONTINUE TO THINK SO
AND HERE TOO HIS LONG HABITS OF SELF-INDULGENCE ARE GREATLY AGAINST HIM
THERE IS NO ONE AT THE GROVE BUT LITTLE ESTHER AND HER FRENCH GOVERNESS FOR WALTER IS ALWAYS AWAY
RIGHT RIGHT LORD LOWBOROUGH CRIED I DARTING OUT AND CLASPING HIS BURNING HAND AS HE WAS MOVING AWAY TO THE STAIRS
AND IF HE COULD NOT HELP HIMSELF SURELY SOME ONE WOULD BE COMING BY
AND THEN RELINQUISHING FURTHER DEPREDATIONS I SAUNTERED ON TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE OLD PLACE AND SEE WHAT CHANGES HAD BEEN WROUGHT IN IT BY ITS NEW INHABITANT
MILICENT TOLD ME I WAS THE LIFE OF THE PARTY AND WHISPERED SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ME SO BRILLIANT
A RAZOR LIKEWISE WAS SNAPPED IN TWO AND THRUST DEEP INTO THE CINDERS OF THE GRATE BUT PARTIALLY CORRODED BY THE DECAYING EMBERS
THE ANIMALS WERE CONSUMEDLY LAZY
IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CLASPED IN THAT OF HIS RELATIVE AND THE RECONCILIATION WAS APPARENTLY CORDIAL ON BOTH SIDES
BUT TOWARDS EVENING IT BEGAN TO CLEAR UP A LITTLE AND THE NEXT MORNING WAS FAIR AND PROMISING
THE SERVANT THAT OPENED THE DOOR TOLD ME HIS MASTER WAS VERY ILL AND SEEMED TO THINK IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER HE WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE ME
BUT THIS SHOULD NOT CONTINUE
I CANNOT LIVE HERE AND BE FOR EVER SILENT ON THE ALL-ABSORBING SUBJECT OF MY THOUGHTS AND WISHES FORMERLY I BELIEVE YOU SPENT BUT LITTLE OF YOUR TIME AT HOME I ANSWERED
FOR OF COURSE MY GOING WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION--OR SENDING A MESSAGE EITHER
I SUPPOSE SHE THINKS I AM A PRODIGAL PURSUED HE OBSERVING THAT I WAS UNWILLING TO REPLY AND CONCLUDES THAT I SHALL HAVE BUT LITTLE WORLDLY GOODS WHEREWITH TO ENDOW MY BETTER HALF
AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS A STRONG DISPLAY OF UNCHASTENED MISDIRECTED PASSIONS
CAN I NOT GO TO SEE MY TENANT ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS WITHOUT BEING ASSAULTED IN THIS MANNER BY THIS IS NO TIME FOR BUSINESS SIR!--I'LL TELL YOU NOW WHAT I THINK OF YOUR CONDUCT YOU'D BETTER DEFER YOUR OPINION TO A MORE CONVENIENT SEASON INTERRUPTED HE IN A LOW TONE--'HERE'S THE VICAR AND IN TRUTH THE VICAR WAS JUST BEHIND ME PLODDING HOMEWARD FROM SOME REMOTE CORNER OF HIS PARISH
HERE ESTHER I'VE BROUGHT YOU THE ROSE SAID HE EXTENDING IT TOWARDS HER
BUT I DON'T THINK IT AT ALL LIKELY THAT I EVER SHALL WHY SO BECAUSE I IMAGINE THERE MUST BE ONLY A VERY VERY FEW MEN IN THE WORLD THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO MARRY
A SMALL PARTY HE HAD INVITED TO SHOOT
ONE BRIGHT MORNING EARLY IN JUNE HE CAME INTO THE FIELD WHERE I WAS JUST COMMENCING MY HAY HARVEST
WELL MRS GRAHAM SAID I CALMLY AND COLDLY
SO MAMMA THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU MUST BE WICKED
AND I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES OF YOUR ATTENTION IN PRIVATE AT ANY TIME AND PLACE YOU LIKE TO APPOINT
I WOULD WAIT HOWEVER TILL THE SIX MONTHS AFTER OUR PARTING WERE FAIRLY PASSED WHICH WOULD BE ABOUT THE CLOSE OF FEBRUARY AND THEN I WOULD SEND HER A LETTER MODESTLY REMINDING HER OF HER FORMER PERMISSION TO WRITE TO HER AT THE CLOSE OF THAT PERIOD AND HOPING I MIGHT AVAIL MYSELF OF IT--AT LEAST TO EXPRESS MY HEARTFELT SORROW FOR HER LATE AFFLICTIONS MY JUST APPRECIATION OF HER GENEROUS CONDUCT AND MY HOPE THAT HER HEALTH WAS NOW COMPLETELY RE-ESTABLISHED AND THAT SHE WOULD SOME TIME BE PERMITTED TO ENJOY THOSE BLESSINGS OF A PEACEFUL HAPPY LIFE WHICH HAD BEEN DENIED HER SO LONG BUT WHICH NONE COULD MORE TRULY BE SAID TO MERIT THAN HERSELF--ADDING A FEW WORDS OF KIND REMEMBRANCE TO MY LITTLE FRIEND ARTHUR WITH A HOPE THAT HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN ME AND PERHAPS A FEW MORE IN REFERENCE TO BYGONE TIMES TO THE DELIGHTFUL HOURS I HAD PASSED IN HER SOCIETY AND MY UNFADING RECOLLECTION OF THEM WHICH WAS THE SALT AND SOLACE OF MY LIFE AND A HOPE THAT HER RECENT TROUBLES HAD
I ALWAYS PREFER YOUR HOME-BREWED TO ANYTHING ELSE FLATTERED AT THIS COMPLIMENT MY MOTHER RANG THE BELL AND A CHINA JUG OF OUR BEST ALE WAS PRESENTLY BROUGHT AND SET BEFORE THE WORTHY GENTLEMAN WHO SO WELL KNEW HOW TO APPRECIATE ITS EXCELLENCES
I SOMETIMES LIKEN IT TO A FIRE OF DRY TWIGS AND BRANCHES COMPARED WITH ONE OF SOLID COAL VERY BRIGHT AND HOT
IT WAS HARD ENOUGH TO COMBAT THOSE SUGGESTIONS AS THEY WERE WHISPERED WITHIN ME
AND WHEN HE WAS USHERED INTO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE THE SICK MAN LAY SO ALTERED FROM HIS FORMER SELF WITH FIERCELY FLUSHED FACE AND WILDLY-GLEAMING EYES--HE INSTINCTIVELY CLUNG TO ME AND STOOD LOOKING ON HIS FATHER WITH A COUNTENANCE EXPRESSIVE OF FAR MORE AWE THAN PLEASURE
SHE WAS NOT DESIROUS TO MIX UP YOUR NAME IN THE MATTER OF COURSE BUT HER DELIGHT WAS AND STILL IS TO BLACKEN YOUR SISTER'S CHARACTER TO THE UTMOST OF HER POWER WITHOUT RISKING TOO GREATLY THE EXPOSURE OF HER OWN MALEVOLENCE I CANNOT BELIEVE IT INTERRUPTED MY COMPANION HIS FACE BURNING WITH INDIGNATION
I KNOW BUT I SHALL NOT GIVE THEM UP WITHOUT A REASON AND I KNOW TOO SAID HE SUDDENLY SEIZING MY CLOSED HAND AND RUDELY ABSTRACTING THEM FROM IT
HEART-BROKEN HE ANSWERED WITH A RUEFUL COUNTENANCE YET WITH A MERRY SMILE JUST LURKING WITHIN HIS EYES AND ABOUT THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH
WHY DID HARGRAVE CONNECT THEM THUS TOGETHER
WHEN MILICENT UTTERED THE SAME DISCOURAGING SENTIMENTS CONCERNING MARRIAGE I ASKED IF SHE WAS HAPPY
I WHOSE JOYOUS GLEAM NO MORTAL LANGUISH CAN EXPRESS
MR AND MRS HATTERSLEY HAVE BEEN STAYING AT THE GROVE A FORTNIGHT
AND THEN I CONFESS I WAS DEEPLY WOUNDED THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME STIMULATED TO SEEK REVENGE;--BUT LATTERLY FINDING BEYOND A DOUBT THAT I WAS NOT THAT EMPTY-HEADED COXCOMB SHE HAD FIRST SUPPOSED ME SHE HAD REPULSED MY MODEST ADVANCES IN QUITE A DIFFERENT SPIRIT
AND WE PARTED
AND WHILE MY EARS DRANK IN THE SOUND MY EYES RESTED ON THE FACE OF HER PRINCIPAL AUDITOR AND DERIVED AN EQUAL OR SUPERIOR DELIGHT FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF HIS SPEAKING COUNTENANCE AS HE STOOD BESIDE HER--THAT EYE AND BROW LIGHTED UP WITH KEEN ENTHUSIASM AND THAT SWEET SMILE PASSING AND APPEARING LIKE GLEAMS OF SUNSHINE ON AN APRIL DAY
AT ANY RATE I WOULD ENTREAT THE EXPLANATION SHE HAD HALF PROMISED TO GIVE ME BEFORE
HARGRAVE SNUFF THOSE CANDLES WILL YOU THEY'RE WAX
FROM THE TWILIGHT SCHOOLROOM AT ROEHEAD EMILY TURNS IN THOUGHT TO THE DISTANT UPLAND OF HAWORTH AND THE LITTLE STONE-BUILT HOUSE UPON ITS CREST THERE IS A SPOT MID BARREN HILLS WHERE WINTER HOWLS AND DRIVING RAIN
FOR I DID NOT KNOW THE STRENGTH AND DEPTH OF YOUR ATTACHMENT
HE MAY AS WELL SEE ME AS YOU SAID I
I SHOULD NEVER EXPECT TO SEE YOU A DEVOTEE BUT IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE TO BE A GOOD CHRISTIAN WITHOUT CEASING TO BE A HAPPY MERRY-HEARTED MAN YOU SPEAK LIKE AN ORACLE HELEN AND ALL YOU SAY IS INDISPUTABLY TRUE
MAY I SIT BY YOU SAID A SOFT VOICE AT MY ELBOW
I THOUGHT SO AT LEAST WHEN I SAW HOW THEY TALKED AND LAUGHED AND GLANCED ACROSS THE TABLE TO THE NEGLECT AND EVIDENT UMBRAGE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NEIGHBOURS--AND AFTERWARDS AS THE GENTLEMEN JOINED US IN THE DRAWING-ROOM WHEN SHE IMMEDIATELY UPON HIS ENTRANCE LOUDLY CALLED UPON HIM TO BE THE ARBITER OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN HERSELF AND ANOTHER LADY AND HE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS WITH ALACRITY AND DECIDED THE QUESTION WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION IN HER FAVOUR--THOUGH TO MY THINKING SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY IN THE WRONG--AND THEN STOOD CHATTING FAMILIARLY WITH HER AND A GROUP OF OTHER LADIES
WHEN I RETURNED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM I FOUND MR BOARHAM HAD VENTURED TO FOLLOW HIS COMRADES TO THE FIELD
SO HAVING OPENED MY DESK I WILL TRY WHAT MAY BE DONE BY DETAILING THE CAUSE OF MY UNEASINESS
HIS PLAY WAS CAUTIOUS AND DEEP BUT I STRUGGLED HARD AGAINST HIM
AND LITTLE ARTHUR WALKED THE GREATER PART OF IT TOO
AND YOU HEAR CONTINUED HE THAT HUNTINGDON IS GONE OUT WITH GRIMSBY WELL I HEARD THE LATTER SAY TO YOUR HUSBAND--OR THE MAN WHO CALLS HIMSELF SO GO ON SIR HE BOWED SUBMISSIVELY AND CONTINUED
AND WHAT'S MORE I HAVE SERIOUS THOUGHTS OF WASHING MY HANDS OF HIM ENTIRELY AND THE WHOLE SET OF EM AND COMPORTING MYSELF FROM THIS DAY FORWARD WITH ALL DECENCY AND SOBRIETY AS A CHRISTIAN AND THE FATHER OF A FAMILY SHOULD DO
THE LAST BUT ONE HE ANSWERED WITH A GRIM SMILE
ANOTHER YEAR
I WAS PARTICULARLY GLAD TO SEE HER BEAUTIFUL BLACK HAIR UNSTINTED STILL AND UNCONCEALED IN ITS GLOSSY LUXURIANCE
CHAPTER VII NOT MANY DAYS AFTER THIS ON A MILD SUNNY MORNING--RATHER SOFT UNDER FOOT
TAKE CARE MAN--LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP
NEVER MIND ARTHUR SAID HIS MAMMA
COME NOW GIVE ME YOUR HAND AND DON'T LOOK SO BLACK UPON IT
WHEN HE CAME TO ME I WAS BLIND TO HIS EXTENDED HAND AND DEAF TO HIS GOOD-NIGHT TILL HE REPEATED IT A SECOND TIME
THE LAST LOVE-SCENE IS WELL EVEN IN PARTS ADMIRABLY WRITTEN
FLUSHED AND FEVERISH LISTLESS AND LANGUID HIS BEAUTY STRANGELY DIMINISHED HIS VIGOUR AND VIVACITY QUITE DEPARTED
BUT ESTHER IS A CHILD AS YET A LITTLE MERRY ROMP OF FOURTEEN
BUT YOU'RE ALL ALIKE
AND LEARN TO INTERFERE BETWEEN ME AND MINE AGAIN IF YOU WERE NOT DRUNK I'D HAVE SATISFACTION FOR THAT GASPED HARGRAVE WHITE AND BREATHLESS AS MUCH FROM PASSION AS FROM THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF THE BLOW
WITH DUE DEFERENCE I OFFERED HER MY MORE COMMODIOUS SEAT
HE WILL BE GLAD TO COME THOUGH HIS OWN PLACE IS SO NEAR FOR HE HAS LITTLE ENOUGH LAND OF HIS OWN TO SHOOT OVER AND WE CAN EXTEND OUR DEPREDATIONS INTO IT IF WE LIKE
THE LADY WAS ABOUT HIS OWN AGE--_I.E BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY--REMARKABLE NEITHER FOR BEAUTY NOR WEALTH NOR BRILLIANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
AND I DID NOT SCRUPLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY OBLIGATION ON THE FIRST CONVENIENT OPPORTUNITY
I HAVE A GOOD MIND TO ASK ARTHUR'S LEAVE TO INVITE THE OLD LADY TO STAY WITH US TILL OUR GUESTS DEPART
IT WAS THE VERY SCENE ITSELF TRANSFERRED AS IF BY MAGIC TO THE CANVAS
BUT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HOPE
THE WEATHER HAD CHANGED LIKE MY PROSPECTS AND THE RAIN WAS PATTERING AGAINST THE WINDOW
19TH.--THEY ARE COME
I SEE SAID HE WITH A BITTER SMILE
BUT ALAS
BUT ALAS
AND I SIGHED TO THINK HOW LITTLE I HAD FELT ITS LOVELINESS AND HOW LITTLE OF A PARADISE SWEET GRASSDALE WAS TO ME--HOW STILL LESS TO THE VOLUNTARY EXILE FROM ITS SCENES
AT ANY RATE I HAD NO BUSINESS TO FEEL SO BITTERLY AGAINST HIM AS I DID
THIS MORNING SHE ROSE EARLIER THAN USUAL
THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IMPRUDENCE WAS SOMETHING LIKE AN APOPLECTIC FIT FOLLOWED BY A RATHER SEVERE BRAIN FEVER AND WHAT DID YOU THINK OF YOURSELF SIR SAID I QUICKLY
YOU CAN BRING YOUR LITTLE BOY WITH YOU YOU KNOW--I DARESAY WE SHALL BE ABLE TO AMUSE HIM;--AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN APOLOGIES TO THE MILLWARDS AND WILSONS--THEY WILL ALL BE HERE I EXPECT THANK YOU I NEVER GO TO PARTIES OH
HIS PHYSICIAN SUPPORTED AND ENFORCED HER ARGUMENTS
BUT I MEANT NOTHING BY IT I ASSURE YOU
AND AS I HAD HATED HIM LIKE A DEMON FOR THE LAST FORTY HOURS THE REACTION FROM SUCH A FEELING WAS SO GREAT THAT I COULD PARDON ALL OFFENCES FOR THE MOMENT--AND LOVE HIM IN SPITE OF THEM TOO I DID TELL YOU SAID HE WITH AN AIR OF GUILTY CONFUSION
THE NEXT MINUTE SAW ME HURRYING WITH RAPID STRIDES IN THE DIRECTION OF WILDFELL HALL--TO WHAT INTENT OR PURPOSE I COULD SCARCELY TELL BUT I MUST BE MOVING SOMEWHERE AND NO OTHER GOAL WOULD DO--I MUST SEE HER TOO AND SPEAK TO HER--THAT WAS CERTAIN
BUT I THOUGHT UPON THE WHOLE THERE COULD BE NO GREAT HARM IN LEAVING YOUR FANCIES AND YOUR HOPES TO DREAM THEMSELVES TO NOTHING--OR FLUTTER AWAY TO SOME MORE FITTING OBJECT WHILE YOUR FRIENDLY SYMPATHIES REMAINED WITH ME
MRS HUNTINGDON WAS FREE NOW
JUST AS I WOULD GLADLY EXCHANGE SOME OF MY OWN QUALITIES FOR THOSE OF BETTER WOMEN
BUT THE LADIES STAYED ONLY THREE WEEKS
THERE ARE PAINFUL ASSOCIATIONS CONNECTED WITH GRASSDALE WHICH SHE CANNOT EASILY OVERCOME
BUT WAS I SUFFICIENTLY SKILFUL AS AN ARTIST TO OBTAIN MY LIVELIHOOD IN A STRANGE LAND WITHOUT FRIENDS AND WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
IT WAS NOT GRIEF
YOU MAY RELY UPON IT IF THE ASSURANCE CAN GIVE YOU ANY PLEASURE
LOOK AT HER MAN
I OPENED ITS PAGES ONCE MORE AND WROTE THE ABOVE ACCOUNT--WITH DIFFICULTY AT FIRST BUT GRADUALLY MY MIND BECAME MORE CALM AND STEADY
CHAPTER LIII WHILE STANDING THUS ABSORBED IN MY GLOOMY REVERIE A GENTLEMAN'S CARRIAGE CAME ROUND THE CORNER OF THE ROAD
BUT I AM GRADUALLY LOSING THAT INSTINCTIVE HORROR AND REPULSION WHICH WERE GIVEN ME BY NATURE OR INSTILLED INTO ME BY THE PRECEPTS AND EXAMPLE OF MY AUNT
EXCUSE THE FAINTNESS OF MY ACQUIESCENCE MILICENT I WOULD NOT DISCOURAGE YOUR HOPES FOR THE WORLD BUT MINE HAVE BEEN SO OFTEN DISAPPOINTED THAT I AM BECOME AS COLD AND DOUBTFUL IN MY EXPECTATIONS AS THE FLATTEST OF OCTOGENARIANS AND YET YOU DO HOPE STILL EVEN FOR MR HUNTINGDON I DO I CONFESS EVEN FOR HIM
BUT I HATE TO BE IN DEBT HE SHOUTED
BUT PLEASE TO STAY HERE A LITTLE TILL THAT SHOCKING COLOUR IS SOMEWHAT ABATED AND YOUR EYES HAVE RECOVERED SOMETHING OF THEIR NATURAL EXPRESSION
IF THINE EYE BE SINGLE THY WHOLE BODY SHALL BE FULL OF LIGHT GRIMSBY REPULSED HIM WITH A SOLEMN WAVE OF THE HAND AND THEN TURNING TO ME CONTINUED WITH THE SAME DRAWLING TONES AND STRANGE UNCERTAINTY OF UTTERANCE AND HEAVY GRAVITY OF ASPECT AS BEFORE
SHE WAS THE VICAR'S YOUNGER DAUGHTER AND A VERY ENGAGING LITTLE CREATURE FOR WHOM I FELT NO SMALL DEGREE OF PARTIALITY;--AND SHE KNEW IT THOUGH I HAD NEVER COME TO ANY DIRECT EXPLANATION AND HAD NO DEFINITE INTENTION OF SO DOING FOR MY MOTHER WHO MAINTAINED THERE WAS NO ONE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME WITHIN TWENTY MILES ROUND COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHTS OF MY MARRYING THAT INSIGNIFICANT LITTLE THING WHO IN ADDITION TO HER NUMEROUS OTHER DISQUALIFICATIONS HAD NOT TWENTY POUNDS TO CALL HER OWN
THERE WAS A SINISTER CAST IN HIS COUNTENANCE AND A MIXTURE OF LURKING FEROCITY AND FULSOME INSINCERITY IN HIS DEMEANOUR THAT I COULD NOT AWAY WITH
BUT HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF YOUR AUNT I TREMBLED FOR THE ANSWER AND CLASPED HER CLOSER TO MY HEART IN THE INSTINCTIVE DREAD OF LOSING MY NEW-FOUND TREASURE
BUT HE HAS BEGUN TO NOTICE HIS BOY AND THAT IS AN INCREASING SOURCE OF AMUSEMENT TO HIM WITHIN-DOORS WHILE HIS FOX-HUNTING AND COURSING ARE A SUFFICIENT OCCUPATION FOR HIM WITHOUT WHEN THE GROUND IS NOT HARDENED BY FROST
I ATTEMPTED TO URGE ARTHUR TO INTERFERE IN BEHALF OF HIS OUTRAGED GUEST BUT HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT LAUGH
I REPENT FOR HIM WEEP PRAY AND FEEL FOR HIM AS FOR MYSELF
AND YOU TELL IT IN CONFIDENCE TO US
WHY SO MR MILLWARD ASKED I
AND AS WELL BY HER COLD SARCASTIC SMILE AS BY THE FEW ISOLATED WORDS OF HER DISCOURSE THAT REACHED ME I KNEW FULL WELL THAT SHE WAS IMPRESSING HIM WITH THE IDEA THAT WE WERE STRONGLY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER
SHE DID NOT TALK MUCH BUT I STOOD AND WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF HER PENCIL
THEREFORE OF COURSE THE CHILD DOTES UPON HIS SEEMINGLY JOYOUS AMUSING EVER-INDULGENT PAPA AND WILL AT ANY TIME GLADLY EXCHANGE MY COMPANY FOR HIS
ALMOST AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE FIRST LETTER I HAD THE UNEXPECTED PLEASURE OF SEEING HIM BLUSH
FOR WE HAD BEEN WALKING OUR HORSES ALL THIS TIME AND WERE CONSEQUENTLY A LONG WAY BEHIND
SINCE LORD LOWBOROUGH'S DEPARTURE I HAD REGARDED THE LIBRARY AS ENTIRELY MY OWN A SECURE RETREAT AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN SAID I APPEALING TO HER SISTER WHO SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN THE HEMMING OF A LARGE COARSE SHEET
WE HAVE NOW BEEN FULL TWO YEARS UNITED
IF YOU REALLY MEAN TO DECEIVE MY AUNT AS YOU SAY YOU ARE VERY WICKED
IT STRUCK ME THAT SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE BELIED ME TO HER
AND HAVING CLEARLY WRITTEN OUT THE PROMISE I WISHED MR HUNTINGDON TO GIVE UPON A SLIP OF PAPER I DELIBERATELY READ IT OVER TO HIM AND MADE HIM SIGN IT IN THE PRESENCE OF RACHEL
THEN AFTER A REFLECTIVE PAUSE HE ADDED AT LEAST I'LL TELL YOU HOW IT WAS I GOT TO KNOW
IN THE FOLLOWING AUTUMN I SAW SO MUCH OF YOUR PERFECTIONS THAT I COULD NOT FAIL TO LOVE YOU THOUGH I DARED NOT SHOW IT
SHE MUST HAVE FOOD AND SLEEP AND A MOUTHFUL OF FRESH AIR NOW AND THEN OR SHE CAN'T STAND IT I TELL YOU
I HAD BROKEN HIS FINE SPIRIT WITH MY RIGID SEVERITY
BUT DROPPING HIS VOICE ALMOST TO A WHISPER YOU SEE WE ARE NOT ALONE WE NEVER ARE RETURNED SHE
AND THEN I HATE HIM TENFOLD MORE THAN EVER FOR HAVING BROUGHT ME TO THIS!--GOD PARDON ME FOR IT AND ALL MY SINFUL THOUGHTS
AND SO HELEN SAID SHE COMING UP TO ME WITH A SMILE OF NO AMIABLE IMPORT YOU ARE TO BE MRS HUNTINGDON I SUPPOSE YES REPLIED I
THERE LET THAT KISS EFFACE THE ONE I GAVE ELIZA
IN TURNING ROUND THERE WAS MY MOTHER CLOSE BESIDE ME
BUT I CANNOT ACT FOR HIM
AND ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT OUT OF HIS ELEMENT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY ENOUGH IN HIS OWN QUIET WAY IF MY MOTHER COULD ONLY HAVE LET HIM ALONE
WELL TELL HIM I'LL THINK ABOUT IT HE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
BUT NEVER MIND HELEN I DON'T CARE FOR HER NOW
BUT STILL HE READS THE INWARD STRUGGLE IN MY FACE AND MISCONSTRUES MY BITTERNESS OF SOUL FOR HIS UNWORTHINESS INTO THE PANGS OF WOUNDED JEALOUSY
HE SEEMED TO BE ALWAYS ON THE WATCH
HE CAME TO CALL UPON MY UNCLE APOLOGISING FOR NOT HAVING DONE SO BEFORE BY SAYING HE WAS ONLY LATELY RETURNED FROM THE CONTINENT AND HAD NOT HEARD TILL THE PREVIOUS NIGHT OF MY UNCLE'S ARRIVAL IN TOWN
AT ALL EVENTS I WOULD NOT WRITE TO HER NOW WHILE SHE WAS WITH HIM AND HER AUNT WHO DOUBTLESS WOULD BE STILL MORE HOSTILE TO MY PRESUMPTUOUS ASPIRATIONS THAN HIMSELF
IF IT BE ANYTHING WORTH HEARING REPLIED I STRUGGLING TO BE COMPOSED FOR I TREMBLED IN EVERY LIMB
MANY A BETTER MAN THAN YOU HAS LIVED AND DIED IN DEBT
HIS FACE WAS ALMOST OPPOSITE THE WINDOW AS HE KNELT
HAVE PATIENCE WITH ME AND BEAR WITH MY LANGUOR AND CROSSNESS A LITTLE WHILE TILL I GET THIS CURSED LOW FEVER OUT OF MY VEINS AND THEN YOU'LL FIND ME CHEERFUL AND KIND AS EVER
ANOTHER TIME IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT,'--BUT I WAS NOT BASE ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HER CANDOUR
BUT BESIDE THEM ALREADY THE YOUNG PRIMROSES WERE PEEPING FROM AMONG THEIR MOIST DARK FOLIAGE AND THE LARK ABOVE WAS SINGING OF SUMMER AND HOPE AND LOVE AND EVERY HEAVENLY THING--I WAS OUT ON THE HILL-SIDE ENJOYING THESE DELIGHTS AND LOOKING AFTER THE WELL-BEING OF MY YOUNG LAMBS AND THEIR MOTHERS WHEN ON GLANCING ROUND ME I BEHELD THREE PERSONS ASCENDING FROM THE VALE BELOW
SHE'S NOT THE STYLE OF WOMAN YOU SOON TIRE OF
ON THE DAY OF LADY LOWBOROUGH'S ARRIVAL I FOLLOWED HER INTO HER CHAMBER AND PLAINLY TOLD HER THAT IF I FOUND REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SHE STILL CONTINUED HER CRIMINAL CONNECTION WITH MR HUNTINGDON I SHOULD THINK IT MY ABSOLUTE DUTY TO INFORM HER HUSBAND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE--OR AWAKEN HIS SUSPICIONS AT LEAST--HOWEVER PAINFUL IT MIGHT BE OR HOWEVER DREADFUL THE CONSEQUENCES
AND BESIDES AS RACHEL OBSERVED WHATEVER I LEFT WOULD MOST LIKELY BECOME THE PROPERTY OF MISS MYERS AND I SHOULD NOT RELISH THAT
NO ONE WILL BELIEVE THAT YOU GO ALONE
AND TOO OFTEN DAMP THE INNOCENT MIRTH I OUGHT TO SHARE
AT LENGTH HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AND QUIETLY MAKING HIS MOVE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID CALMLY NOW YOU THINK YOU WILL WIN DON'T YOU I HOPE SO REPLIED I TAKING HIS PAWN THAT HE HAD PUSHED INTO THE WAY OF MY BISHOP WITH SO CARELESS AN AIR THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS AN OVERSIGHT BUT WAS NOT GENEROUS ENOUGH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO DIRECT HIS ATTENTION TO IT AND TOO HEEDLESS AT THE MOMENT TO FORESEE THE AFTER-CONSEQUENCES OF MY MOVE
THOUGH YOU STAND THERE WITH YOUR WHITE FACE AND FLASHING EYES LOOKING AT ME LIKE A VERY TIGRESS I KNOW THE HEART WITHIN YOU PERHAPS A TRIFLE BETTER THAN YOU KNOW IT YOURSELF WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD I LEFT THE ROOM AND LOCKED MYSELF UP IN MY OWN CHAMBER
YOU THINK THAT IF YOU WERE TO ACCEPT THAT TRIFLE FROM ME NOW I SHOULD PRESUME UPON IT HEREAFTER
THEN AFTER A PAUSE DURING WHICH WE BOTH STOOD GAZING ON THE CALM BLUE WATER--I REVOLVING IN MY MIND THE BEST MEANS OF POLITELY DISMISSING MY COMPANION HE NO DOUBT PONDERING OTHER MATTERS EQUALLY ALIEN TO THE SWEET SIGHTS AND SOUNDS THAT ALONE WERE PRESENT TO HIS SENSES,--HE SUDDENLY ELECTRIFIED ME BY BEGINNING IN A PECULIAR TONE LOW SOFT BUT PERFECTLY DISTINCT TO POUR FORTH THE MOST UNEQUIVOCAL EXPRESSIONS OF EARNEST AND PASSIONATE LOVE
I COLDLY TURNED TO THE TABLE AND BEGAN TO POUR OUT THE COFFEE OBSERVING THAT HE WAS RATHER LATE
HIS COUNTENANCE BRIGHTENED
THAT SOUNDS FAR-FETCHED
SHE WILL NEITHER DEPLORE HIS FAULTS NOR ATTEMPT THEIR AMENDMENT BUT RATHER AGGRAVATE THEM BY HER OWN
SOMETIMES CLUTCHING MY ARM WITH VIOLENCE--THE BIG DROPS STARTING FROM HIS FOREHEAD AT THE THOUGHTS OF WHAT HE SEES OR THINKS HE SEES BEFORE HIM
SHE MUST NOT SEE ME THUS
AND INDEED THE ADMISSION GIVES ME LESS PAIN THAN MIGHT BE EXPECTED FOR SINCE I LOVE HIM SO MUCH I CAN EASILY FORGIVE HIM FOR LOVING HIMSELF
WHAT A TIRESOME CUSTOM THAT IS BY-THE-BY--ONE AMONG THE MANY SOURCES OF FACTITIOUS ANNOYANCE OF THIS ULTRA-CIVILISED LIFE
SO I MOUNTED MY HORSE AND SET FORTH ON THE EXPEDITION SOON AFTER BREAKFAST
OH GRACIOUS
I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW THEY CAN GO ON AS THEY DO I COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE SERIOUS DEPTH OF HER WONDERMENT
HE'S ONLY IN THE GARDEN--WALTER NO NO ESTHER
INDEED HE WAS SELDOM IN A CONDITION TO BE TALKED TO
BUT IT IS USELESS DWELLING ON THIS THEME
THIS TAMED HIM STILL MORE
WE WOUND UP THE EVENING WITH DANCING--OUR WORTHY PASTOR THINKING IT NO SCANDAL TO BE PRESENT ON THE OCCASION THOUGH ONE OF THE VILLAGE MUSICIANS WAS ENGAGED TO DIRECT OUR EVOLUTIONS WITH HIS VIOLIN
WHILE I THUS STOOD LEANING ON MY GUN AND LOOKING UP AT THE DARK GABLES SUNK IN AN IDLE REVERIE WEAVING A TISSUE OF WAYWARD FANCIES IN WHICH OLD ASSOCIATIONS AND THE FAIR YOUNG HERMIT NOW WITHIN THOSE WALLS BORE A NEARLY EQUAL PART I HEARD A SLIGHT RUSTLING AND SCRAMBLING JUST WITHIN THE GARDEN
YOU SEE LAWRENCE AND I SOMEHOW COULD NOT MANAGE TO GET ON VERY WELL TOGETHER
I WOULD NOT FOR MUCH THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF HER RELATION YOU USE HARD WORDS MRS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU AND NOW LADY LOWBOROUGH CONTINUED I LET ME COUNSEL YOU TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AND AS FOR OTHERS THE QUESTION IS BETWEEN OURSELVES ALONE
WELL THEN IT MUST BE THAT YOU THINK THEY ARE BOTH WEAK AND PRONE TO ERR AND THE SLIGHTEST ERROR THE MEREST SHADOW OF POLLUTION WILL RUIN THE ONE WHILE THE CHARACTER OF THE OTHER WILL BE STRENGTHENED AND EMBELLISHED--HIS EDUCATION PROPERLY FINISHED BY A LITTLE PRACTICAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH FORBIDDEN THINGS
AND DOES YOUR HAPPY WIFE EXACT NO MORE
THERE WAS A SILENT STRUGGLE AND THEN A PIERCING SHRIEK;--BUT IN AN INSTANT I HAD DROPPED MY GUN ON THE GRASS AND CAUGHT THE LITTLE FELLOW IN MY ARMS
OH NO SAID SHE
BUT DO YOU KNOW I HAVE RENDERED YOU A GREAT SERVICE
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR SISTER IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF SAID I A LITTLE PROVOKED AT THE CIRCUMSTANCE ON HER ACCOUNT INSTEAD OF COMMISERATING HIM
WHAT ANNOYS ME THE MOST IS HIS OCCASIONAL ATTEMPTS AT AFFECTIONATE FONDNESS THAT I CAN NEITHER CREDIT NOR RETURN
IF HE COULD BUT FULLY KNOW AND TRULY FEEL MY WRONGS I SHOULD BE WELL AVENGED AND I COULD FREELY PARDON ALL
AND TWO YEARS HENCE YOU WILL BE AS CALM AS I AM NOW AND FAR FAR HAPPIER I TRUST FOR YOU ARE A MAN AND FREE TO ACT AS YOU PLEASE SOMETHING LIKE A SMILE BUT A VERY BITTER ONE CROSSED HIS FACE FOR A MOMENT
IF LIFE PROMISED NO ENJOYMENT WITHIN MY VOCATION AT LEAST IT OFFERED NO ALLUREMENTS OUT OF IT
I ONLY KNEW SHE WAS STILL THERE BY HER BROTHER'S BRIEF ANSWERS TO MY MANY AND VARIED INQUIRIES RESPECTING HER
BUT ESTHER IS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE YOU
AND I BELIEVE I WAS RIGHT
AND BESIDES I WAS MISANTHROPICALLY INCLINED AND MOREOVER HAD A PARTICULAR OBJECTION TO MEETING JANE WILSON OR HER MOTHER
SHORTLY AFTER THE DEATH OF HER MOTHER SHE WITHDREW THE LIGHT OF HER PRESENCE FROM RYECOTE FARM FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE ANY LONGER TO ENDURE THE ROUGH MANNERS AND UNSOPHISTICATED HABITS OF HER HONEST BROTHER ROBERT AND HIS WORTHY WIFE OR THE IDEA OF BEING IDENTIFIED WITH SUCH VULGAR PEOPLE IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD AND TOOK LODGINGS IN
IF YOU COULD SEE MY HEART YOU MUST BE ONE,--IF NOT BOTH
THE PLACE IS IN RUINS SHE HAS HAD TWO OR THREE ROOMS MADE HABITABLE
AND I THINK GRIMSBY FOR ANOTHER
AND ROUSING FROM MY DESPONDENT APATHY I EXERTED ALL MY POWERS TO ERADICATE THE WEEDS THAT HAD BEEN FOSTERED IN HIS INFANT MIND AND SOW AGAIN THE GOOD SEED THEY HAD RENDERED UNPRODUCTIVE
YOU KNOW I HAVE YOUR OWN PROMISE THAT I MAY GO WHENEVER I PLEASE AND TAKE MY SON WITH ME OH BUT YOU SHALL HAVE NO CAUSE AND THEN FOLLOWED A VARIETY OF PROFESSIONS WHICH I RATHER COLDLY CHECKED
OH GILBERT HOW YOU TREMBLE EXCLAIMED MY ANXIOUS PARENT
FACSIMILE OF THE TITLE-PAGE OF THE FIRST EDITION CHAPTER I YOU MUST GO BACK WITH ME TO THE AUTUMN OF 1827
ON THE OTHER HAND MISS WILSON WAS AS AFFABLE AND COURTEOUS AS HEART COULD WISH AND THOUGH I WAS IN NO VERY CONVERSABLE HUMOUR MYSELF THE TWO LADIES BETWEEN THEM MANAGED TO KEEP UP A PRETTY CONTINUOUS FIRE OF SMALL TALK
BUT NOTICE THE INSTINCTIVE RIGHTNESS AND SWIFTNESS OF EMILY'S THE BLURRED WEAKNESS OF ANNE'S FOR YONDER GARDEN FAIR AND WIDE WITH GROVES OF EVERGREEN LONG WINDING WALKS AND BORDERS TRIM AND VELVET LAWNS BETWEEN RESTORE TO ME THAT LITTLE SPOT WITH GRAY WALLS COMPASSED ROUND WHERE KNOTTED GRASS NEGLECTED LIES AND WEEDS USURP THE GROUND
AT LENGTH I CONCLUDED THAT THE SEPARATION COULD BE ENDURED NO LONGER BY THIS TIME YOU WILL SEE I WAS PRETTY FAR GONE
IN ALL MY EMPLOYMENTS WHATEVER I DO OR SEE OR HEAR HAS AN ULTIMATE REFERENCE TO HIM
NO MATTER MY DEAR SAID I
AND IF HE CAN'T COMPLAIN THAT HIS WIFE HARRIES HIM TO DEATH WITH HER PERVERSITY AND ILL-HUMOUR HE MUST COMPLAIN THAT SHE WEARS HIM OUT WITH HER KINDNESS AND GENTLENESS BUT WHY COMPLAIN AT ALL UNLESS BECAUSE YOU ARE TIRED AND DISSATISFIED TO EXCUSE MY OWN FAILINGS TO BE SURE
THE ATMOSPHERE OF GRASSDALE SEEMED TO STIFLE ME AND I COULD ONLY LIVE BY THINKING OF WILDFELL HALL
IT IS FROM NO SELFISH MOTIVE THAT I ASK IT AND NOT FOR ANY CAUSE THAT COULD ALARM YOUR SUPERHUMAN PURITY
I CANNOT BEAR IT FORGETFULNESS IS NOT TO BE PURCHASED WITH A WISH
IN FACT WE MUST BE STRANGERS FOR THE FUTURE I WILL THEN--BE YOUR FRIEND OR BROTHER OR ANYTHING YOU WISH IF YOU WILL ONLY LET ME CONTINUE TO SEE YOU
WE HAVE LINGERED TOO LONG
SHE HAS BASELY DECEIVED AND BETRAYED YOU
HOW COULD YOU DO SO
ELIZA WAS STARTLED
I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BUT ONCE SINCE I WAS A BABY AND I WELL KNEW HE HAD NEVER CARED A STIVER ABOUT ME
AND A PROUD UN HE WAS AND A WILFUL
I WILL ONLY MAKE THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT LITTLE HONOURABLE AS IT MAY BE TO HUMAN NATURE AND ESPECIALLY TO MYSELF,--THAT THE FORMER HALF OF THE NARRATIVE WAS TO ME MORE PAINFUL THAN THE LATTER NOT THAT I WAS AT ALL INSENSIBLE TO MRS HUNTINGDON'S WRONGS OR UNMOVED BY HER SUFFERINGS BUT I MUST CONFESS I FELT A KIND OF SELFISH GRATIFICATION IN WATCHING HER HUSBAND'S GRADUAL DECLINE IN HER GOOD GRACES AND SEEING HOW COMPLETELY HE EXTINGUISHED ALL HER AFFECTION AT LAST
DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME YES I BELIEVE YOU MURMURED SHE IN A TONE OF HALF SAD HALF SULLEN RESIGNATION AS SHE TURNED AWAY TO STROKE THE HAIR OF HER SLEEPING INFANT THAT SHE HAD LAID ON THE SOFA BESIDE HER
HERE I SAT DOWN TO THINK OVER THE VIRTUES AND WRONGS OF THE LADY OF WILDFELL HALL
I LEAVE YOU TO-MORROW AND I MAY NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO YOU AGAIN
HE WILL FOLLOW YOU AND BRING YOU BACK I HAVE LAID MY PLANS TOO WELL FOR THAT
HAD THE POISON OF DETRACTING TONGUES ALREADY SPREAD THROUGH ALL
BUT HE PUSHED THEM BACK MUTTERING TAKE THEM AWAY
I SHOULD THINK SHE'LL MARRY NONE BUT A NOBLEMAN MYSELF
ON THE CONTRARY HE WOULD CLING TO ME AND FOLLOW ME ANYWHERE BUT TO THE CLUB AND THE GAMING-HOUSES AND SUCH-LIKE DANGEROUS PLACES OF RESORT--HE WAS SO WEARY OF HIS OWN MOPING MELANCHOLY MIND
I'M SORRY I OFFENDED YOU BY MY ABRUPTNESS WHEN A LADY CONDESCENDS TO APOLOGISE THERE IS NO KEEPING ONE'S ANGER OF COURSE
HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SOME SEVERITY AND TURNING AGAIN TO MY MOTHER REPEATED,--'I THOUGHT IT INCUMBENT UPON ME AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN
I SOON ACQUAINTED RACHEL WITH MY DESIGN CONFIDING ALL MY MOTIVES AND INTENTIONS TO HER EAR AND MUCH TO MY AGREEABLE SURPRISE FOUND LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING HER TO ENTER INTO MY VIEWS
WE ENTERED THE DESOLATE COURT AND IN BREATHLESS ANXIETY SURVEYED THE RUINOUS MASS
SURELY I'M NOT SO PROUD AND SO DAINTY AS THAT COMES TO
BUT WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER SHE TURNED AWAY HER GLISTENING EYE AND CRIMSON CHEEK AND THREW UP THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT WHETHER TO CALM HER OWN EXCITED FEELINGS OR TO RELIEVE HER EMBARRASSMENT OR ONLY TO PLUCK THAT BEAUTIFUL HALF-BLOWN CHRISTMAS-ROSE THAT GREW UPON THE LITTLE SHRUB WITHOUT JUST PEEPING FROM THE SNOW THAT HAD HITHERTO NO DOUBT DEFENDED IT FROM THE FROST AND WAS NOW MELTING AWAY IN THE SUN
BUT SHE REMAINED IN SILENCE LOOKING OUT UPON THE SNOWY LAWN
I HAVE NOT THE HEART TO DO IT FOR I THINK HE IS ASHAMED OF HIMSELF-HE MUST BE SO INDEED AND SUCH INQUIRIES COULD NOT FAIL TO BE PAINFUL TO BOTH
I KNOW NOT HOW SHE PASSED THE NIGHT BUT I LAY AWAKE THE GREATER PART OF IT LISTENING TO HIS HEAVY STEP PACING MONOTONOUSLY UP AND DOWN HIS DRESSING-ROOM WHICH WAS NEAREST MY CHAMBER
NICHOLLS THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL BY ANNE BRONTE WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY MRS HUMPHREY WARD LONDON JOHN MURRAY ALBEMARLE STREET W
BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOUNG MAN HERE HE PUT HIS FACE INTO MINE WITH AN IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL AIR SHE'S NOT WORTH IT AND HE CONFIRMED THE ASSERTION BY A SOLEMN NOD
AND IS HE SO MUCH WORSE MILICENT THAN MR HATTERSLEY WELL TO GIVE YOU MY CANDID OPINION I THINK THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN THEM
YOU TALKED ABOUT MY HEALTH
BUT THE COFFIN MUST BE CLOSED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AND THEREFORE YOU WOULD OBLIGE ME BY EXPLAINING YOUR MEANING A LITTLE FURTHER THIS IS SCARCELY THE TIME OR THE PLACE FOR SUCH EXPLANATIONS
AND WHILE HE STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS AND EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND I KNEW WELL ENOUGH WHAT WAS PASSING IN HIS MIND
I HAVE FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED MY SURPRISE AT HIS CONDUCT AND REMINDED HIM OF HIS DUTIES AND HIS PRIVILEGES--BUT TO NO PURPOSE
THOUGH OF COURSE ALL THIS PASSED IN A MUCH SHORTER TIME THAN I HAVE TAKEN TO RELATE OR EVEN THAN YOU WILL TAKE TO READ IT
I SHOULD REJOICE WITH MORE SECURITY TO BE SURE HAD THE BROAD SEA ROLLED BETWEEN MY PRESENT AND MY FORMER HOMES
AND WHEN HE DID RETURN TO MY GREAT JOY INSTEAD OF BEING WORSE THAN WHEN HE WENT HE WAS MORE CHEERFUL AND VIGOROUS AND BETTER IN EVERY RESPECT
YOU MIGHT IF YOU WOULD
AND MAKE HIM SEE AND FEEL HIS GUILT--I ASK NO OTHER VENGEANCE
TO THIS END I LEFT THE MORE FREQUENTED REGIONS THE WOODED VALLEYS THE CORN-FIELDS AND THE MEADOW-LANDS AND PROCEEDED TO MOUNT THE STEEP ACCLIVITY OF WILDFELL THE WILDEST AND THE LOFTIEST EMINENCE IN OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE AS YOU ASCEND THE HEDGES AS WELL AS THE TREES BECOME SCANTY AND STUNTED THE FORMER AT LENGTH GIVING PLACE TO ROUGH STONE FENCES PARTLY GREENED OVER WITH IVY AND MOSS THE LATTER TO LARCHES AND SCOTCH FIR-TREES OR ISOLATED BLACKTHORNS
I KNOW YOU AS WELL AS I EVER SHALL AND BETTER THAN YOU KNOW ME OR YOU WOULD NEVER DREAM OF UNITING YOURSELF TO ONE SO INCONGRUOUS--SO UTTERLY UNSUITABLE TO YOU IN EVERY WAY BUT MY DEAR YOUNG LADY I DON'T LOOK FOR PERFECTION
ONE HAND WAS THROWN LISTLESSLY OVER THE BACK OF THE SOFA AND HELD A SMALL VOLUME WITH WHICH APPARENTLY HE HAD BEEN VAINLY ATTEMPTING TO BEGUILE THE WEARY HOURS
BUT WHAT THEN WHAT THEN
TEARS ROSE UNBIDDEN TO MY EYES AND I BURIED MY FACE IN THE SOFA-PILLOW THAT THEY MIGHT FLOW UNSEEN WHILE I LISTENED
WE NEVER MENTION HER
HELEN--SPEAK
ALL THIS WAS TOO SACRED FOR ANY EYES BUT HER OWN AND SHE HAD DONE WELL TO KEEP IT FROM ME
GILBERT DO LEAVE ME SHE CRIED IN A TONE OF SUCH THRILLING ANGUISH THAT I FELT IT WOULD BE CRUEL TO DISOBEY
NEXT MORNING THEREFORE I NOT ONLY FORTIFIED MYSELF WITH AS SUBSTANTIAL A BREAKFAST AS MY EXCITED FEELINGS WOULD ALLOW ME TO SWALLOW BUT I BESTOWED A LITTLE MORE THAN USUAL TIME AND CARE UPON MY TOILET
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOU--I SPEAK OF THOSE I DO KNOW--AND WHEN I SEE THE WHOLE RACE OF MANKIND WITH A FEW RARE EXCEPTIONS STUMBLING AND BLUNDERING ALONG THE PATH OF LIFE SINKING INTO EVERY PITFALL AND BREAKING THEIR SHINS OVER EVERY IMPEDIMENT THAT LIES IN THEIR WAY SHALL I NOT USE ALL THE MEANS IN MY POWER TO INSURE FOR HIM A SMOOTHER AND A SAFER PASSAGE YES BUT THE SUREST MEANS WILL BE TO ENDEAVOUR TO FORTIFY HIM AGAINST TEMPTATION NOT TO REMOVE IT OUT OF HIS WAY I WILL DO BOTH MR MARKHAM
BUT NO--CONFOUND IT--THERE WAS SOME ONE COMING DOWN THE AVENUE
MY HEART WILL BURST IF I DON'T
THERE NOW
THERE NOW
AND SOME FOR A BIT OF SWAGGER LIKES TO MAKE IT APPEAR AS THOUGH THEY KNEW MORE THAN THEY DO AND TO THROW OUT HINTS AND THINGS JUST TO ASTONISH THE OTHERS
BUT HE IS NOW SO COMPLETELY RECONCILED TO MY ATTENDANCE IN GENERAL THAT HE IS NEVER SATISFIED WHEN I AM NOT BY HIS SIDE
FROM THE ACCOUNT I RECEIVED THIS MORNING I SHOULD SAY IT WAS HER WRITING
BUT HER EYES--I MUST NOT FORGET THOSE REMARKABLE FEATURES FOR THEREIN HER CHIEF ATTRACTION LAY--IN OUTWARD ASPECT AT LEAST;--THEY WERE LONG AND NARROW IN SHAPE THE IRIDS BLACK OR VERY DARK BROWN THE EXPRESSION VARIOUS AND EVER CHANGING BUT ALWAYS EITHER PRETERNATURALLY--I HAD ALMOST SAID DIABOLICALLY--WICKED OR IRRESISTIBLY BEWITCHING--OFTEN BOTH
AND NOT CHOOSING TO BE OVER CIVIL I HAD MERELY BOWED AS SHE ENTERED AND CONTINUED MY OCCUPATION AS BEFORE
IF NOT I MUST CONFESS I WOULD RATHER YOU KEPT AWAY SHE THEN TURNED AND ADDRESSED SOME OBSERVATION TO ROSE OR ELIZA
LET HER INJURE YOU NO FURTHER
FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS HE BEHAVED SO REMARKABLY WELL AND MANAGED SO SKILFULLY TOO THAT I WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY OFF MY GUARD AND WAS REALLY BEGINNING TO LOOK UPON HIM AS A FRIEND AND EVEN TO TREAT HIM AS SUCH WITH CERTAIN PRUDENT RESTRICTIONS WHICH I DEEMED SCARCELY NECESSARY
HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU KISS YOUR DOLT OF A HUSBAND SCORES OF TIMES?--AND DO I EVER COMPLAIN BUT TELL ME DON'T YOU LOVE HER STILL--A LITTLE SAID SHE PLACING HER HAND ON HIS ARM LOOKING EARNESTLY IN HIS FACE--FOR I COULD SEE THEM PLAINLY THE MOON SHINING FULL UPON THEM FROM BETWEEN THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE THAT SHELTERED ME
RICHARD WILSON JANE'S YOUNGER BROTHER SAT IN A CORNER APPARENTLY GOOD-TEMPERED BUT SILENT AND SHY DESIROUS TO ESCAPE OBSERVATION BUT WILLING ENOUGH TO LISTEN AND OBSERVE
THIS IS GRIMSBY'S SCRAWL--ONLY THREE LINES THE SULKY DOG
WELL MRS GRAHAM SAID MY MOTHER WIPING THE TEARS OF MERRIMENT FROM HER BRIGHT BLUE EYES--'WELL YOU SURPRISE ME
SHE HAS FAR MORE PIECES THAN YOU STILL I INTEND TO GIVE YOU SOME TROUBLE YET SAID I
I WILL COMMIT IT TO PAPER TO-NIGHT AND SEE WHAT I SHALL THINK OF IT TO-MORROW
IT IS JUST--SIX-WEEKS--BY MY RECKONING SINCE YOU DARKENED--MY--DOOR HE SPOKE IT WITH EMPHASIS AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR
RALPH ATTEMPTED TO KEEP ME BY VIOLENCE
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO QUEER SAID HE HALF LAUGHING HALF FRIGHTENED AT THE UNEXPECTED ASPECT OF MY FACE IN SUDDENLY TURNING TOWARDS HIM,--'AND WHY HAVE YOU KEPT SO LONG AWAY
I CANNOT DOUBT THAT HE HAS GOT AMONG HIS FORMER COMPANIONS AGAIN
THE SOIL WAS THIN AND POOR
INTERNAL INFLAMMATION HAD TAKEN PLACE WHICH MIGHT TERMINATE FATALLY IF NOT SOON REMOVED
BUT THEN I MAINTAIN THAT IF SHE WERE MORE PERFECT SHE WOULD BE LESS INTERESTING AND SO YOU PREFER HER FAULTS TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFECTIONS JUST SO--SAVING MY MOTHER'S PRESENCE OH MY DEAR GILBERT WHAT NONSENSE YOU TALK!--I KNOW YOU DON'T MEAN IT
AND I WAS SO FORTUNATE AS TO CATCH HIM WHILE HE HUNG SUSPENDED HEADLONG FROM THAT TREE AND PREVENT I KNOW NOT WHAT CATASTROPHE I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR STAMMERED SHE;--SUDDENLY CALMING DOWN,--THE LIGHT OF REASON SEEMING TO BREAK UPON HER BECLOUDED SPIRIT AND A FAINT BLUSH MANTLING ON HER CHEEK--'I DID NOT KNOW YOU;--AND I THOUGHT SHE STOOPED TO KISS THE CHILD AND FONDLY CLASPED HER ARM ROUND HIS NECK
I GAVE THE BRIEFEST POSSIBLE ANSWERS TO HIS QUERIES AND OBSERVATIONS AND FELL BACK
HIS LETTERS WHEN THEY COME ARE KIND IF FAIR WORDS AND ENDEARING EPITHETS CAN GIVE THEM A CLAIM TO THE TITLE--BUT VERY SHORT AND FULL OF TRIVIAL EXCUSES AND PROMISES THAT I CANNOT TRUST
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF ANY HONEST READER SHALL HAVE DERIVED MORE PAIN THAN PLEASURE FROM ITS PERUSAL AND HAVE CLOSED THE LAST VOLUME WITH A DISAGREEABLE IMPRESSION ON HIS MIND I HUMBLY CRAVE HIS PARDON FOR SUCH WAS FAR FROM MY INTENTION
BUT GOD HAVE MERCY ON HIS MISERABLE SOUL
HE HAD HER WITH HIM IN LONDON ALL THE SEASON AND SHE WAS NO TROUBLE AT ALL
THIS WAS MY FIRST EXPERIMENT IN THAT LINE
THE OLD WOMAN BROUGHT MY SUPPER AND ARTHUR'S INTO THE PARLOUR AND TOLD ME WITH ALL DUE FORMALITY THAT THE MASTER DESIRED HIS COMPLIMENTS TO MRS GRAHAM AND HE HAD PREPARED THE ROOMS AS WELL AS HE COULD UPON SO SHORT A NOTICE
I MOVED TO THE BELL AND PUT MY HAND UPON THE CORD
SO LET ME DISMISS THAT THOUGHT AT ONCE
WHY NO
I DECLARE WE OLD UNS ARE THE KEENEST SPORTSMEN OF THE LOT I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I CAN DO TO-DAY HOWEVER SAID MY COMPANION
AND PERHAPS YOU WILL THEN SEE THE NECESSITY OF DISCONTINUING OUR INTIMACY--IF INDEED YOU DO NOT WILLINGLY RESIGN ME AS ONE NO LONGER WORTHY OF REGARD I CAN SAFELY ANSWER NO TO THAT
IT WAS NOT HOWEVER FOR ANY TENDER COLLOQUY THAT MY COMPANION HAD BROUGHT ME THERE MY AUNT IS PARTICULARLY FOND OF FLOWERS SHE OBSERVED AND SHE IS FOND OF STANINGLEY TOO
IF A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE CAN DISPOSE YOU TO SERIOUS AND USEFUL THOUGHTS I WOULD NOT DEPRIVE YOU OF THE BENEFIT OF SUCH REFLECTIONS WHETHER YOU DO EVENTUALLY RECOVER OR NOT
SHE MIGHT BE STILL AT STANINGLEY
THIS ROSE IS NOT SO FRAGRANT AS A SUMMER FLOWER BUT IT HAS STOOD THROUGH HARDSHIPS NONE OF THEM COULD BEAR
AND YOU REALLY DID NOT MEAN TO CALL SHE EXCLAIMED
IT'S QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION SAID MY MOTHER GETTING UP AND BUSTLING OUT OF THE ROOM UNDER PRETENCE OF HOUSEHOLD BUSINESS IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THE CONTRADICTION THAT WAS TREMBLING ON MY TONGUE
AND THEN RUSHING BACK TO THE TABLE HE STRUCK HIS HAND UPON IT AND RAISING HIS VOICE HIGH ABOVE ALL THE CONFUSION OF JINGLING COINS AND MUTTERED OATHS AND CURSES IN THE ROOM HE SWORE A DEEP AND SOLEMN OATH THAT COME WHAT WOULD THIS TRIAL SHOULD BE THE LAST AND IMPRECATED UNSPEAKABLE CURSES ON HIS HEAD IF EVER HE SHOULD SHUFFLE A CARD OR RATTLE A DICE-BOX AGAIN
I ONLY WISH YOU MAY NOT FIND YOUR CONFIDENCE MISPLACED AND SHE RAISED HER FACE AND GAVE ME SUCH A LOOK OF SORROWFUL TENDERNESS AS MIGHT HAVE MELTED MY HEART BUT WITHIN THOSE EYES THERE LURKED A SOMETHING THAT I DID NOT LIKE
I WARNED YOU BEFOREHAND YOU KNOW BUT YOU WOULD NOT HE SAID NO MORE
I FEEL ALMOST AS IF I WERE BORN FOR SUCH A FATE BUT SHE IS SO JOYOUS AND FRESH SO LIGHT OF HEART AND FREE OF SPIRIT AND SO GUILELESS AND UNSUSPECTING TOO
THE EVENT MUST COME SOME TIME AND SO I LOOK TO THE BRIGHT SIDE OF IT
AT ANY RATE RESUMED SHE PURSUING HER ADVANTAGE YOU CAN CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT YOU ARE WORTHY OF ALL THE LOVE HE GIVES TO YOU YOU FLATTER ME SAID I
WHAT IS IT MISS MILLWARD
EVERY FORMER FEATURE OF HIS MALADY HAD RETURNED WITH AUGMENTED VIRULENCE
HIS WORST AND ONLY VICE IS THOUGHTLESSNESS AND THOUGHTLESSNESS PURSUED MY AUNT MAY LEAD TO EVERY CRIME AND WILL BUT POORLY EXCUSE OUR ERRORS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD
YOU MISTAKE HER QUIET SUBMISSION FOR AFFECTION FIRE AND FURY NOW DON'T BURST INTO A TEMPEST AT THAT
I CAN'T BEAR THAT WHITE FACE AND THOSE EYES
HAPPILY IT WILL SOON BE THE SHOOTING SEASON AND THEN IF THE WEATHER PERMIT HE WILL FIND OCCUPATION ENOUGH IN THE PURSUIT AND DESTRUCTION OF THE PARTRIDGES AND PHEASANTS
AND I HOPE HIS LORDSHIP WILL CONDESCEND TO SIT DOWN WITH US SUCH AS WE ARE AND ALLOW ME TO GIVE HIM SOME TEA HIS LORDSHIP GRAVELY BOWED IN ANSWER TO MY APPEAL BUT SAID NOTHING
ONLY TO THIS THAT THOUGH YOU ADMIRE ANNABELLA SO MUCH AND FOR QUALITIES THAT I DON'T POSSESS YOU WOULD STILL RATHER HAVE ME THAN HER FOR YOUR WIFE WHICH MERELY PROVES THAT YOU DON'T THINK IT NECESSARY TO LOVE YOUR WIFE
I HAVE THOUGHT OF ALL THESE MATTERS AGAIN AND AGAIN
I WONDER WHAT SHE CAN SEE TO LIKE IN ME THOUGH FOR I AM NO LONGER THE HAPPY LIVELY GIRL I USED TO BE
A LIGHT WIND SWEPT OVER THE CORN AND ALL NATURE LAUGHED IN THE SUNSHINE
I'M QUITE USED UP
MIGHT I NOT FIND MORE BENEFIT IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THAT VENERABLE PILE WITH THE FULL MOON IN THE CLOUDLESS HEAVEN SHINING SO CALMLY ABOVE IT--WITH THAT WARM YELLOW LUSTRE PECULIAR TO AN AUGUST NIGHT--AND THE MISTRESS OF MY SOUL WITHIN THAN IN RETURNING TO MY HOME WHERE ALL COMPARATIVELY WAS LIGHT AND LIFE AND CHEERFULNESS AND THEREFORE INIMICAL TO ME IN MY PRESENT FRAME OF MIND,--AND THE MORE SO THAT ITS INMATES ALL WERE MORE OR LESS IMBUED WITH THAT DETESTABLE BELIEF THE VERY THOUGHT OF WHICH MADE MY BLOOD BOIL IN MY VEINS--AND HOW COULD I ENDURE TO HEAR IT OPENLY DECLARED OR CAUTIOUSLY INSINUATED--WHICH WAS WORSE?--I HAD HAD TROUBLE ENOUGH ALREADY WITH SOME BABBLING FIEND THAT WOULD KEEP WHISPERING IN MY EAR IT MAY BE TRUE TILL I HAD SHOUTED ALOUD IT IS FALSE
I TOLD HER SHE OVER-RATED MY INFLUENCE WITH YOU THAT I WOULD GLADLY DRAW YOU AWAY FROM THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE TOWN IF I COULD BUT HAD LITTLE HOPE OF SUCCESS AND THAT I THOUGHT SHE WAS WRONG IN SUPPOSING THAT YOU ENTICED MR HATTERSLEY OR ANY ONE ELSE INTO ERROR
I GAVE HER A LOOK THAT BLIGHTED THE MALICIOUS SMILE ON HER FACE OR CHECKED IT AT LEAST FOR A MOMENT AND DEPARTED
BUT HIS THOUGHTS SEEMED CHIEFLY BENT UPON HIS PONY ON WHICH HE WAS WISTFULLY GAZING--HALF IN HELPLESS ANXIETY AND HALF IN HOPELESS ABANDONMENT TO HIS FATE
SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT WE HAD BEEN QUARRELLING DESPERATELY AND WAS EVIDENTLY PERPLEXED AND DISTURBED AT THE CIRCUMSTANCE
MAY I KEEP THIS LETTER LAWRENCE?--YOU SEE SHE HAS NEVER ONCE MENTIONED ME THROUGHOUT--OR MADE THE MOST DISTANT ALLUSION TO ME
MR HARGRAVE SAW THAT I COULD ILL ENDURE IT AND LOOKING UP FROM HIS DESK HE ANSWERED HER QUESTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS FOR ME AS FAR AS HE COULD AND ATTEMPTED TO TRANSFER HER SOCIAL ATTENTIONS FROM ME TO HIMSELF
BUT WHAT IS HE DOING--WHAT IS IT THAT KEEPS HIM AWAY
AND THIS TIME SHE HAD INVITED US TO A DINNER-PARTY AND GOT TOGETHER AS MANY OF THE COUNTRY GENTRY AS WERE WITHIN REACH TO MEET US
FOR HERE WERE ALL THE LADIES TO OUTSHINE AND ALL THE GENTLEMEN TO CHARM,--AND MR LAWRENCE ESPECIALLY TO CAPTURE AND SUBDUE
I SUPPOSE MY FACE WAS CRIMSON
AS A MAN I LOVE HIM SO MUCH THAT I WISH HIM A BETTER WIFE THAN I--ONE AS GOOD AS HIMSELF OR BETTER--IF YOU THINK THAT POSSIBLE--PROVIDED SHE COULD LIKE HIM
I WISH SHE PAUSED
WORSE THAN EVER I REPLIED
I THOUGHT--AT LEAST I ENDEAVOURED TO THINK YOUR REGARD FOR ME WAS AS COLD AND FRATERNAL AS YOU PROFESSED IT TO BE OR AS YOURS OR AS MINE--OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN--OF SUCH A LIGHT AND SELFISH SUPERFICIAL NATURE THAT THERE INDEED YOU WRONGED ME PICTURE
AND THEN I'LL LET YOU ALONE
HE GAVE A SLIGHT TITTER ON SEEING ME CHANGE COLOUR
BUT THE SPIRIT WITHIN HER WAS NOT SUBDUED
BUT YOU CANNOT DENY THAT YOU HAVE DEGRADED YOURSELF MISERABLY
LIFE AND ALL ITS INTERESTS ITS PETTY CARES AND TRANSIENT PLEASURES WERE A CRUEL MOCKERY
AND YET IT IS FAR HANDSOMER AND FAR MORE AGREEABLE--FAR LESS REPULSIVE I SHOULD RATHER SAY--THAN HE IS NOW
I WILL SHAME HIM INTO VIRTUE IF I CAN AND I WILL NEVER LET HIM LEAVE ME AGAIN
PLEASE SIR RICHARD SAYS ONE OF THE HORSES HAS GOT A VERY BAD COLD AND HE THINKS SIR IF YOU COULD MAKE IT CONVENIENT TO GO THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW INSTEAD OF TO-MORROW HE COULD PHYSIC IT TO-DAY SO AS CONFOUND HIS IMPUDENCE INTERJECTED THE MASTER
WILMOT AND BOARHAM HAVE SEVERALLY TAKEN OCCASION BY HIS NEGLECT OF ME TO RENEW THEIR ADVANCES
HIS SUFFERINGS BEGAN TO ABATE HE GRADUALLY BECAME MORE COMPOSED AND AT LENGTH SANK INTO A KIND OF SLUMBER
THESE GUESTS MIGHT NOT BE WITH US LONG BUT THEY WOULD RETURN AGAIN
BUT I HASTILY CAUGHT IT AWAY AND REPLIED,--'IT IS NOTHING TO YOU MR HUNTINGDON ARE YOU SURE IT IS NOTHING TO ME HE RETURNED
BUT HAVING BID ADIEU TO ROSE MRS GRAHAM PRESENTED HER HAND TO ME SAYING WITH A SOFT VOICE AND BY NO MEANS A DISAGREEABLE SMILE,--'LET NOT THE SUN GO DOWN UPON YOUR WRATH MR MARKHAM
BUT I NEVER CONJECTURED WHO THE RIDER MIGHT BE OR TROUBLED MY HEAD ABOUT HIM TILL ON SLACKENING MY PACE TO ASCEND A GENTLE ACCLIVITY OR RATHER SUFFERING MY HORSE TO SLACKEN HIS PACE INTO A LAZY WALK--FOR RAPT IN MY OWN REFLECTIONS I WAS LETTING IT JOG ON AS LEISURELY AS IT THOUGHT PROPER--I LOST GROUND AND MY FELLOW-TRAVELLER OVERTOOK ME
I CAN BE READY AT ANY TIME YOU WOULD NOT TAKE THAT CHILD TO TOWN YES
SO WE PARTED GOOD FRIENDS FOR ONCE
I ACCOMPANIED HER HALF-WAY UP THE HILL
AND DON'T THINK MRS HUNTINGDON HE ADDED ALOUD THAT I COULD BE GUILTY OF INCITING HIM TO PERSEVERE IN HIS PRESENT PURSUITS
OH HUNTINGDON WILL LEND YOU WHAT YOU WANT SAID THE OTHER
AND AFTER THAT ANOTHER PAROXYSM OF PAIN CAME ON
OVERCOMING WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT MY REPUGNANCE TO MENTION HER NAME TO MY GARRULOUS COMPANION I ASKED HIM IF HE KNEW WHETHER HER LATE HUSBAND HAD LEFT A WILL AND HOW THE PROPERTY HAD BEEN DISPOSED OF
I WAS NOT GOING TO STAND THERE TO EXPOSE MY TORTURED FEELINGS TO THE INSOLENT LAUGHTER AND IMPERTINENT CURIOSITY OF A FELLOW LIKE THAT
IF EVERYBODY FOLLOWED YOUR ADVICE THE WORLD WOULD SOON COME TO AN END NEVER FEAR MY DEAR
HE LIKES TO BE PLEASED AND IT IS MY DELIGHT TO PLEASE HIM
CHILDREN ARE NATURALLY PRONE TO HANKER AFTER FORBIDDEN THINGS
SWEET INNOCENT
YOU'LL DO YOUR BUSINESS AND SHE IF SHE'S WORTHY OF YOU WILL DO HERS
IT WAS A DULL DRIZZLY DAY
I WISH I COULD BLOT THEM FROM MY MEMORY OR ELSE GET HIM TO REGARD SUCH MATTERS IN THE SAME LIGHT AS I DO
BECAUSE IF THERE IS ANY DOUBT AND IF YOU SHOULD FIND YOURSELF MISTAKEN AFTER ALL WHEN IT IS TOO LATE TO TURN IT WOULD BE RATHER AWKWARD TO BE SURE SAID HE
I WANT TO BE DRESSED AND INDEED I WAS ANXIOUS TO BE RID OF THE GOOD WOMAN FOR I WAS IN SUCH A MELANCHOLY FRAME I COULD HARDLY KEEP THE TEARS OUT OF MY EYES WHILE SHE DRESSED ME
IT WAS HALF OPEN
I BREATHED AGAIN--HE WAS ONLY STUNNED BY THE FALL
I SUPPOSE I MAYN'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS SAID I AS I DISMOUNTED AND RELINQUISHED MY HORSE TO THE GARDENER WHO BEING THE ONLY SERVANT WITHIN CALL HAD BEEN SUMMONED BY HIS MASTER FROM HIS EMPLOYMENT OF RAKING UP THE DEAD LEAVES ON THE LAWN TO TAKE HIM TO THE STABLES
ELIZA WOULD HAVE REPLIED BUT I INTERRUPTED HER BY SAYING AS CALMLY AS I COULD THOUGH IN A TONE WHICH BETRAYED NO DOUBT SOME LITTLE OF WHAT I FELT WITHIN,--'WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS SUBJECT
YES THERE WAS ANOTHER BARRIER
YOU WILL NOT EASILY OBTAIN MY AUNT'S CONSENT
THERE IT IS YOU SEE
I WAS RATHER IN WANT OF AMUSEMENT AND SO RARE AN OPPORTUNITY WAS NOT TO BE NEGLECTED
IF I HEAR NOT HIM NEITHER SHOULD I BE CONVINCED THOUGH ONE ROSE FROM THE DEAD HE WOULD TELL YOU
IT IS ITS FATHER IT RESEMBLES AM I NOT RIGHT NURSE SAID HE APPEALING TO RACHEL
BUT MR HUNTINGDON VOUCHSAFED TO ACCOMPANY US AGAIN
YES TO BE SURE--OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WELL I HOPE YOU'LL MAKE HIM A GOOD WIFE THANK YOU MY DEAR
WELL WHAT THEN SAID HE WITH THE CALM INSOLENCE OF MINGLED SHAMELESSNESS AND DESPERATION
YOU MAY TELL ME THAT YOU SCORN AND DETEST ME BUT SINCE YOU HAVE SET ME THE EXAMPLE OF PLAIN SPEAKING I WILL ANSWER THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU
IT WAS USELESS WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY AND USELESS TRYING TO CONCOCT A SPEECH FOR THE OCCASION
AND HE LOVES ME IN HIS OWN WAY--BUT OH HOW DIFFERENT FROM THE LOVE I COULD HAVE GIVEN AND ONCE HAD HOPED TO RECEIVE
THIS INCIDENT AGITATED AND DISTURBED ME MOST UNACCOUNTABLY--UNLESS YOU WOULD ACCOUNT FOR IT BY SAYING THAT CUPID'S ARROWS NOT ONLY HAD BEEN TOO SHARP FOR ME BUT THEY WERE BARBED AND DEEPLY ROOTED AND I HAD NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO WRENCH THEM FROM MY HEART
AND YOU THOUGHT TO ROB ME OF MY SON TOO AND BRING HIM UP TO BE A DIRTY YANKEE TRADESMAN OR A LOW BEGGARLY PAINTER YES TO OBVIATE HIS BECOMING SUCH A GENTLEMAN AS HIS FATHER IT'S WELL YOU COULDN'T KEEP YOUR OWN SECRET--HA HA
NOBODY CAN BLAME ME MORE THAN I BLAME MYSELF IN MY OWN HEART
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY PRETTY TYRANT YOU'LL MAKE ME REGRET MY CHOICE IN GOOD EARNEST AND ENVY MY FRIEND HATTERSLEY HIS MEEK LITTLE WIFE
THERE IS JUST A PLEASANT GLOW A HEALTHY FRESHNESS IN HIS COMPLEXION--THE WARM PINKY TINT OF THE WHOLE HARMONISING WITH THE DEEPER COLOUR OF THE CHEEKS EXACTLY AS IT OUGHT TO DO
WHEN HE HAD DONE YAWNING OVER HIS PAPER AND SCRIBBLING SHORT ANSWERS TO HIS SHORTER LETTERS HE SPENT THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING AND THE WHOLE OF THE AFTERNOON IN FIDGETING ABOUT FROM ROOM TO ROOM WATCHING THE CLOUDS CURSING THE RAIN ALTERNATELY PETTING AND TEASING AND ABUSING HIS DOGS SOMETIMES LOUNGING ON THE SOFA WITH A BOOK THAT HE COULD NOT FORCE HIMSELF TO READ AND VERY OFTEN FIXEDLY GAZING AT ME WHEN HE THOUGHT I DID NOT PERCEIVE IT WITH THE VAIN HOPE OF DETECTING SOME TRACES OF TEARS OR SOME TOKENS OF REMORSEFUL ANGUISH IN MY FACE
WHEN HE WAS THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED WITH EVERY KIND OF WINE I ALLOWED HIM AT HIS OWN REQUEST TO TRY BRANDY-AND-WATER AND THEN GIN-AND-WATER FOR THE LITTLE TOPER WAS FAMILIAR WITH THEM ALL AND I WAS DETERMINED THAT ALL SHOULD BE EQUALLY HATEFUL TO HIM
IT IS I WHO HAVE LEFT THEM WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER
HIS KINDNESS MAY NOT ALL BE FEIGNED
AND I'M TO LABOUR AWAY TILL THEN AM I?--AND TO KEEP ALL THESE FELLOWS HARD AT IT BESIDES
HERE ISN'T HALF ENOUGH WE HAD SCARCELY ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM BEFORE WE WERE JOINED BY LORD LOWBOROUGH
SO DON'T EXCITE SUCH WICKED PASSIONS AGAIN FOR MY SOUL'S SAKE I WILL GIVE MY WHOLE HEART AND SOUL TO MY MAKER IF I CAN I ANSWERED AND NOT ONE ATOM MORE OF IT TO YOU THAN HE ALLOWS
BUT MY HEART WAS AWAY UP THE HILL IN THAT DARK ROOM WHERE SHE WAS WEEPING DESOLATE AND ALONE--SHE WHOM I WAS NOT TO COMFORT NOT TO SEE AGAIN TILL YEARS OR SUFFERING HAD OVERCOME US BOTH AND TORN OUR SPIRITS FROM THEIR PERISHING ABODES OF CLAY
DEAR FREDERICK,--I KNOW YOU WILL BE ANXIOUS TO HEAR FROM ME AND I WILL TELL YOU ALL I CAN
VERY GOOD WAS THE REPLY
I'LL TAKE A GLASS OF YOUR EXCELLENT ALE WITH PLEASURE CRIED MY MOTHER PROCEEDING WITH ALACRITY TO PULL THE BELL AND ORDER THE FAVOURED BEVERAGE
BUT STILL I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT
AND NOW THE HARVEST IS BEGINNING HUMPH JUST THEN MY MOTHER CAME IN AND CREATED A DIVERSION IN MY FAVOUR BY HER LOQUACIOUS AND ANIMATED WELCOME OF THE REVEREND GUEST
I THEREFORE GAVE HIM QUITE AS MUCH AS HIS FATHER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ALLOW HIM
YOU ARE PINING FOR THE FRESH BREEZES OF YOUR COUNTRY HOME AND YOU SHALL FEEL THEM BEFORE YOU ARE TWO DAYS OLDER
MR HARGRAVE CONSIDERABLY TO MY ANNOYANCE DID NOT GO WITH HIM
GO THEN YOU VIXEN HE SAID
I COULD NOW SEE THE REASON OF ARTHUR'S STRANGE RECEPTION OF ME IN THE SHRUBBERY
I MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE MY HAND FROM HIS GRASP
YOU REMEMBER THAT EVENING WHEN I WAS HERE LAST I DO EVEN THEN YOU DROPPED SOME HINTS THAT MIGHT HAVE OPENED THE EYES OF A WISER MAN
AND I WITHDREW AND DID NOT TROUBLE HIM WITH MY PRESENCE AGAIN THAT DAY EXCEPT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO AT A TIME JUST TO SEE HOW HE WAS AND WHAT HE WANTED
AND MY FEET WERE GLUED TO THE FLOOR
AND HE DID COME NEXT WEEK BUT IN A CONDITION OF BODY AND MIND EVEN WORSE THAN BEFORE
AND WHEN HE PAUSED TO BREATHE I CALMLY ASSURED HIM THAT HE WAS ENTIRELY MISTAKEN
I WILL NOT I REPLIED
I WAS THEREFORE ATTIRED IN A PLAIN BLACK SILK DRESS AND MANTLE A BLACK VEIL WHICH I KEPT CAREFULLY OVER MY FACE FOR THE FIRST TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OF THE JOURNEY AND A BLACK SILK BONNET WHICH I HAD BEEN CONSTRAINED TO BORROW OF RACHEL FOR WANT OF SUCH AN ARTICLE MYSELF
I FOUND THE LATTER RECLINING ON THE SOFA JUST AS I HAD LEFT HIM
I WOULD RATHER GIVE THAN RECEIVE OH
SENTENCE OF IMMEDIATE BANISHMENT WAS PASSED UPON HIM ON THE FIRST INDICATION OF FRETFULNESS
AT ANY RATE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE SEEN IT ALL--TO HAVE WITNESSED THE GRADUAL CHANGE AND WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF HER ESTEEM AND FRIENDSHIP FOR ME AND WHATEVER WARMER FEELING SHE MIGHT HAVE
I SHUDDER STILL AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF HIS VOICE--DRONE DRONE DRONE IN MY EAR--WHILE HE SAT BESIDE ME PROSING AWAY BY THE HALF-HOUR TOGETHER AND BEGUILING HIMSELF WITH THE NOTION THAT HE WAS IMPROVING MY MIND BY USEFUL INFORMATION OR IMPRESSING HIS DOGMAS UPON ME AND REFORMING MY ERRORS OF JUDGMENT OR PERHAPS THAT HE WAS TALKING DOWN TO MY LEVEL AND AMUSING ME WITH ENTERTAINING DISCOURSE
FEEL MY HAND AND I GRAVELY EXTENDED IT TOWARDS HIM--BUT CLOSED IT UPON HIS WITH AN ENERGY THAT SEEMED TO DISPROVE THE ASSERTION AND MADE HIM SMILE
I HELEN I WANT YOU A MOMENT SAID THE DISTINCT LOW VOICE OF MY AUNT CLOSE BESIDE US
IT WAS DAYLIGHT STILL AND SHE SHOULD MEET NO ONE
LET ME GO THEN I MURMURED
HE WAS NEVER WILLING TO GO AND I FREQUENTLY HAD TO CARRY HIM AWAY BY FORCE FOR WHICH HE THOUGHT ME VERY CRUEL AND UNJUST
I WOULD WAIT HOWEVER TILL HE CAME BACK
SEIZING HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE I EXCLAIMED,--'NOW LAWRENCE I WILL HAVE THIS MYSTERY EXPLAINED
I COULD DO WITH LESS CARESSING AND MORE RATIONALITY
JULY 3RD.--MY LAST BITTER LETTER HAS WRUNG FROM HIM AN ANSWER AT LAST AND A RATHER LONGER ONE THAN USUAL
THEN LEAVING HIM TO THE DISCUSSION OF HIS SUBSTANTIAL REFRESHMENT I GLADLY QUITTED THE HOUSE AND WENT TO LOOK AFTER MY REAPERS
STAY WITH ME DO
BEFORE IT ENCLOSED BY STONE WALLS AND ENTERED BY AN IRON GATE WITH LARGE BALLS OF GREY GRANITE--SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH DECORATED THE ROOF AND GABLES--SURMOUNTING THE GATE-POSTS WAS A GARDEN,--ONCE STOCKED WITH SUCH HARD PLANTS AND FLOWERS AS COULD BEST BROOK THE SOIL AND CLIMATE AND SUCH TREES AND SHRUBS AS COULD BEST ENDURE THE GARDENER'S TORTURING SHEARS AND MOST READILY ASSUME THE SHAPES HE CHOSE TO GIVE THEM,--NOW HAVING BEEN LEFT SO MANY YEARS UNTILLED AND UNTRIMMED ABANDONED TO THE WEEDS AND THE GRASS TO THE FROST AND THE WIND THE RAIN AND THE DROUGHT IT PRESENTED A VERY SINGULAR APPEARANCE INDEED
THEY WERE NOT ALTOGETHER THE TEARS OF SORROW OR OF FEAR FOR HER DISPLEASURE BUT RATHER THE OUTBREAK OF THE GENERAL TUMULTUOUS EXCITEMENT OF MY FEELINGS
THAT WORTHY INDIVIDUAL SHE HAD BEEN EQUALLY SOLICITOUS TO KEEP AWAY
MY NEW ACQUAINTANCES BOTH MALE AND FEMALE DISAPPOINTED MY EXPECTATIONS AND VEXED AND DEPRESSED ME BY TURNS
SO YOU SEE HELEN I HAVE MANAGED PRETTY WELL BOTH FOR YOUR FRIEND AND MINE POOR MILICENT
BITTER BITTER CONFESSION
OBEDIENCE FROM SUCH A MOTIVE WOULD BE POSITIVE WICKEDNESS AND CERTAIN TO BRING THE PUNISHMENT IT DESERVES
LET IT NOT BE IMAGINED HOWEVER THAT I CONSIDER MYSELF COMPETENT TO REFORM THE ERRORS AND ABUSES OF SOCIETY BUT ONLY THAT I WOULD FAIN CONTRIBUTE MY HUMBLE QUOTA TOWARDS SO GOOD AN AIM
BESIDES HE HAD BEEN INVITED BY ONE OF HIS FRIENDS TO SPEND A MONTH OR TWO IN SCOTLAND FOR THE BETTER RECREATION OF GROUSE-SHOOTING AND DEER-STALKING AND HAD PROMISE TO GO
IF IT BE THE WILL OF GOD THAT WE SHOULD SOW IN TEARS NOW IT IS ONLY THAT WE MAY REAP IN JOY HEREAFTER
MY CAUSES OF DISLIKE WERE TOO RATIONAL MY SUSPICIONS TOO WELL FOUNDED FOR THAT
I TRAVELLED ALL NIGHT OF COURSE FOR THIS WAS WEDNESDAY
I SHA'N'T CARE I AM NOT OFFENDED LOVE
HE WILL NEITHER BE ENLIGHTENED NOR ROUSED NOR COMFORTED BY ANYTHING I SAY
I'LL BELIEVE YOUR WORD AS WELL AS YOUR OATH
ON SEEING ME HE SUDDENLY DREW IN HIS LITTLE STEED AND SEEMED INCLINED TO TURN BACK BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT APPARENTLY JUDGED IT BETTER TO CONTINUE HIS COURSE AS BEFORE
I HAVE HOWEVER ONE REQUEST TO OFFER CONTINUED SHE
NOW ALSO HIS APPETITE FOR FOOD IS BEGINNING TO RETURN
WITH MORE GOOD FEELING THAN I GAVE HIM CREDIT FOR HE EVINCES CONSIDERABLE SYMPATHY FOR HIS UNHAPPY FRIEND AND IS FAR MORE WILLING THAN ABLE TO COMFORT HIM
BUT TO HIS PRAISE BE IT SPOKEN HER SHAFTS FELL POWERLESS BY HIS SIDE
IF THE GENTLEMEN MUST LEAD THE LADIES INTO THE DINING-ROOM WHY CANNOT THEY TAKE THOSE THEY LIKE BEST
BUT SHE SAYS IT WAS AS GOOD AS AN ACCEPTANCE AND HE WOULD THINK ME VERY CAPRICIOUS IF I WERE TO ATTEMPT TO DRAW BACK--AND INDEED I WAS SO CONFUSED AND FRIGHTENED AT THE MOMENT I CAN HARDLY TELL WHAT I SAID
HE FORGETS HOW OFTEN I HAD REASONED HIM PAST HIS PATIENCE BEFORE
AUTHOR'S PREFACE 1 TO THE SECOND EDITION WHILE I ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUCCESS OF THE PRESENT WORK TO HAVE BEEN GREATER THAN I ANTICIPATED AND THE PRAISES IT HAS ELICITED FROM A FEW KIND CRITICS TO HAVE BEEN GREATER THAN IT DESERVED I MUST ALSO ADMIT THAT FROM SOME OTHER QUARTERS IT HAS BEEN CENSURED WITH AN ASPERITY WHICH I WAS AS LITTLE PREPARED TO EXPECT AND WHICH MY JUDGMENT AS WELL AS MY FEELINGS ASSURES ME IS MORE BITTER THAN JUST
HER EYES I COULD NOT SEE FOR BEING BENT UPON HER PRAYER-BOOK THEY WERE CONCEALED BY THEIR DROOPING LIDS AND LONG BLACK LASHES BUT THE BROWS ABOVE WERE EXPRESSIVE AND WELL DEFINED
THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT HIM TO HANG ONE'S ESTEEM AND AFFECTION UPON
ANNE'S SUFFERINGS WERE MILD HER MIND GENERALLY SERENE AND AT THE LAST SHE THANKED GOD THAT DEATH WAS COME AND COME SO GENTLY WHEN CHARLOTTE RETURNED TO THE DESOLATE HOUSE AT HAWORTH EMILY'S LARGE HOUSE-DOG AND ANNE'S LITTLE SPANIEL WELCOMED HER IN A STRANGE HEART-TOUCHING WAY SHE WRITES TO MR WILLIAMS
HE SAID IF YOU LIKED TO TAKE HIM YOU MIGHT
HOWEVER THAT HAVEN OF BLISS MUST NOT BE ENTERED TILL I HAD EXCHANGED MY MIRY BOOTS FOR A CLEAN PAIR OF SHOES AND MY ROUGH SURTOUT FOR A RESPECTABLE COAT AND MADE MYSELF GENERALLY PRESENTABLE BEFORE DECENT SOCIETY
SO FAREWELL TO IT AND YOU
BUT BY NEXT SEASON SHE HAS NO DOUBT I SHALL HAVE MORE SENSE AND HOPES MY GIRLISH FANCIES WILL BE WORN AWAY
DID HE NOT THINK HOW UNWORTHY HE WAS OF SUCH A POSSESSION
AND WHEN HE SEES ME OCCUPIED WITH A BOOK HE WON'T LET ME REST TILL I CLOSE IT
THERE WAS NO OTHER TO PRESERVE MY NAME FROM BEING BLACKENED AND ASPERSED AMONG THIS NEST OF BOON COMPANIONS AND THROUGH THEM PERHAPS INTO THE WORLD
BUT THOUGH I COULD SEE MYSELF SUSPECTED AND CONDEMNED BY EVERY ONE ELSE AND BEAR IT WITH CALMNESS I CANNOT ENDURE IT FROM YOU.--WHY DID YOU NOT COME TO HEAR MY EXPLANATION ON THE DAY I APPOINTED TO GIVE IT BECAUSE I HAPPENED IN THE INTERIM TO LEARN ALL YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME--AND A TRIFLE MORE I IMAGINE IMPOSSIBLE FOR I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU ALL CRIED SHE PASSIONATELY--'BUT I WON'T NOW FOR I SEE YOU ARE NOT WORTHY OF IT AND HER PALE LIPS QUIVERED WITH AGITATION
BUT I RESTRAINED THE IMPULSE AND ANSWERING HIS SALUTATION WITH A NOD ATTEMPTED TO PUSH ON
MILLWARD I EXCLAIMED IN A TONE OF WRATHFUL MENACE THAT MADE THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN LOOK ROUND--AGHAST--ASTOUNDED AT SUCH UNWONTED INSOLENCE AND STARE ME IN THE FACE WITH A LOOK THAT PLAINLY SAID WHAT THIS TO ME BUT I WAS TOO INDIGNANT TO APOLOGISE OR TO SPEAK ANOTHER WORD TO HIM
BUT WHEN MR HUNTINGDON IS MARRIED HE WON'T HAVE MANY OPPORTUNITIES OF CONSORTING WITH HIS BACHELOR FRIENDS;--AND THE WORSE THEY ARE THE MORE I LONG TO DELIVER HIM FROM THEM TO BE SURE MY DEAR
LET HIM TRUST IN THE NAME OF THE LORD AND STAY UPON HIS GOD CHAPTER XXXVII DECEMBER 20TH 1825.--ANOTHER YEAR IS PAST
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT A JOVIAL GOOD FELLOW HE IS WHEN HE'S NOT FAIRLY DRUNK ONLY JUST PRIMED OR HALF-SEAS-OVER
BUT THIS TIME SHE DECLINED MY PROFFERED AID IN SO KIND AND FRIENDLY A MANNER THAT I ALMOST FORGAVE HER
I COULD OFFER NO MORE
AND I THINK IN FUTURE I MUST CONTRIVE TO BRING HIM WITH ME OR STAY AT HOME IS HE SO MISCHIEVOUS ASKED MY MOTHER CONSIDERABLY SHOCKED
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN THAT WAS CALLED AFTER ME FROM BELOW
PAPA'S JUST GONE OUT INTO THE PARISH AND NOT LIKELY TO BE BACK FOR AN HOUR NEVER MIND
AND THE MORE MY SENSES ARE PLEASED THE MORE MY HEART IS OPPRESSED
AND THEN SHE SPOKE SO GRATEFULLY OF THE KINDNESS SHE HAD EXPERIENCED FROM ITS DIFFERENT MEMBERS THAT I REPROACHED MYSELF FOR MY UNCHARITABLE THOUGHTS AND UNFRIENDLY CONDUCT AND RELENTED FOR A TIME BUT NOT FOR LONG
AND IF NOT YOU MIGHT PLEASE YOURSELF HE SAID RIGHT
IF WEEDS SPRING FAST THERE SO DO BETTER PLANTS
AND I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK MY LOT TOO HAPPY AND MY HUSBAND ACTUALLY TOO GOOD FOR ME IF NOT TOO GOOD FOR THIS WORLD WHEN ON THE SECOND SUNDAY AFTER OUR ARRIVAL HE SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED ME BY ANOTHER INSTANCE OF HIS UNREASONABLE EXACTION
PERHAPS SHE THOUGHT I HAD A HEADACHE AND COULD NOT BEAR TO TALK
NOT ONLY FROM THE INTEREST I TOOK IN HIS RECOVERY AND MY DESIRE TO CHEER HIM UP AND MAKE THE UTMOST POSSIBLE AMENDS FOR MY FORMER BRUTALITY BUT FROM MY GROWING ATTACHMENT TO HIMSELF AND THE INCREASING PLEASURE I FOUND IN HIS SOCIETY--PARTLY FROM HIS INCREASED CORDIALITY TO ME BUT CHIEFLY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS CLOSE CONNECTION BOTH IN BLOOD AND IN AFFECTION WITH MY ADORED HELEN
AND WHETHER I RIGHTLY DIVINED HIS MUSINGS OR NOT THE OBSERVATION CHIMED IN WITH HIS THOUGHTS FOR HE ANSWERED--'IT CAN'T BE HELPED WITH A RUEFUL SMILE AT MY PENETRATION
HE FELL BACK TOO AND ASKED IF MY HORSE WAS LAME
HELEN WHAT MEANS THIS I CRIED ELECTRIFIED AT THIS STARTLING CHANGE IN HER DEMEANOUR
I IMMEDIATELY SENT FOR THE DOCTOR
HOW DISMAL YOU ARE HELEN
AND CAN I LEAVE ALL PERTURBATION SORROW AND ANXIETY BEHIND ME THERE AND I TURNED ROUND TO LOOK AT THE OLD HALL
HE WAS A MAN OF GOOD FAMILY AND LARGE POSSESSIONS BUT THE NAUGHTY GIRL MAINTAINED HE WAS OLD AS ADAM UGLY AS SIN AND HATEFUL AS--ONE WHO SHALL BE NAMELESS
BECAUSE YOU ARE CLEVER IN SOME THINGS AND WELL INFORMED YOU MAY FANCY YOURSELF EQUAL TO THE TASK
BUT AS IT IS HUNTINGDON DO YOU THINK ANYBODY WOULD TAKE ME--RUINED AND WRETCHED AS I AM YES CERTAINLY WHO WHY ANY NEGLECTED OLD MAID FAST SINKING IN DESPAIR WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO NO NO SAID HE--"IT MUST BE SOMEBODY THAT I CAN LOVE WHY YOU JUST SAID YOU NEVER COULD BE IN LOVE AGAIN WELL LOVE IS NOT THE WORD--BUT SOMEBODY THAT I CAN LIKE
BUT YOU I TRUSTED WERE BETTER INFORMED THAN TO SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND JUDGE WITH THEIR PERVERTED JUDGMENT
BUT THEN YOU WOULD GLADLY EXCHANGE SOME OF HIS QUALITIES FOR THOSE OF BETTER MEN YES
AND YET WHILE I THUS YIELD AND MINISTER TO HIS MORE HARMLESS PROPENSITIES TO SELF-INDULGENCE TO DO ALL IN MY POWER TO SAVE HIM FROM THE WORSE
AND THEN TELLING MY SISTER IT WAS TIME TO GO SHOOK HANDS WITH THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN COOLLY BOWED TO THE LADY AND MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR
NOW THAT MAY STRIKE YOU AS VERY SINGULAR BUT I THINK I CAN EXPLAIN IT
AND I RETURNED TO MY BUSINESS
IMPOSSIBLE YES NOT WILLINGLY
I GLANCED AT THE FIRST PAGE
RACHEL HAD RISEN MANY DEGREES IN MY ESTIMATION SINCE YESTERDAY
HE MEANT NO HARM--IT WAS ONLY HIS JOYOUS PLAYFUL SPIRIT
AT LENGTH HOWEVER BY SOME HEROIC EFFORT WE TORE OURSELVES APART AND I RUSHED FROM THE HOUSE
WAS I NOT CERTAIN THAT SHE IN INTELLECT IN PURITY AND ELEVATION OF SOUL WAS IMMEASURABLY SUPERIOR TO ANY OF HER DETRACTORS
I CAN'T STAND IT I TELL YOU
YOU'RE RIGHT CRIED SHE
AT SUCH A MOMENT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
AND NOT ONLY WAS I BEGINNING TO THINK SO BUT I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO ACT UPON THE THOUGHT--AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT
IT WOULD NOT NOW--UNLESS TO DO SO WOULD BE TO VIOLATE THE TRUTH I WAS TOO MUCH AGITATED TO SPEAK
BUT I THINK I HAVE DONE WITH THAT GENTLEMAN AT LAST
WHERE DID YOU LEARN ALL THIS IN THE BIBLE AUNT
THE TORMENT OF SUSPENSE WAS NOT TO BE ENDURED
NOT AT ALL IF LORD LOWBOROUGH LIKES HIS COMPANY YOU HAVE NO LOVE LEFT FOR HIM THEN NOT THE LEAST I KNEW THAT--I KNEW YOU WERE TOO HIGH-MINDED AND PURE IN YOUR OWN NATURE TO CONTINUE TO REGARD ONE SO UTTERLY FALSE AND POLLUTED WITH ANY FEELINGS BUT THOSE OF INDIGNATION AND SCORNFUL ABHORRENCE IS HE NOT YOUR FRIEND SAID I TURNING MY EYES FROM THE FIRE TO HIS FACE WITH PERHAPS A SLIGHT TOUCH OF THOSE FEELINGS HE ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER
HUMPH!--SHE SHALL CHANGE HER MIND BEFORE LONG IF I THINK IT WORTH WHILE BUT THEN IT FLASHED UPON ME THAT THESE WERE VERY IMPROPER THOUGHTS FOR A PLACE OF WORSHIP AND THAT MY BEHAVIOUR ON THE PRESENT OCCASION WAS ANYTHING BUT WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE
BUT I CONFESS I DO FEEL JEALOUS AT TIMES MOST PAINFULLY BITTERLY SO
AND SPOIL ALL HER PLANS AND PROSPECTS POOR GIRL
YOU WERE GENERALLY PRETTY WELL SATISFIED WITH HER THEN YOU MUST HAVE BEEN LETTING HER GET INTO SLOVENLY HABITS THEN WHILE I WAS AWAY
A HARDNESS SUCH AS THIS IS TAUGHT BY ROUGH EXPERIENCE AND DESPAIR ALONE
THOUGH I HATE HIM FROM MY HEART AND SHOULD REJOICE AT ANY CALAMITY THAT COULD BEFALL HIM I'LL LEAVE HIM TO GOD
HE RETURNED HOWEVER IN EIGHT OR NINE WEEKS AND DID NOT ENTIRELY KEEP ALOOF FROM ME BUT COMPORTED HIMSELF IN SO REMARKABLE A MANNER THAT HIS QUICK-SIGHTED SISTER COULD NOT FAIL TO NOTICE THE CHANGE
BUT YOU MUST NOT GO TILL YOU HAVE SEEN THE CONSERVATORY MY AUNT'S WINTER GARDEN SAID HELEN AS I ADVANCED TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER WITH AS MUCH PHILOSOPHY AND SELF-COMMAND AS I COULD SUMMON TO MY AID
SHE REGRETTED DEEPLY THAT HE HAD NOT COME A LITTLE EARLIER IN TIME FOR TEA BUT OFFERED TO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATELY PREPARED IF HE WOULD DO HER THE FAVOUR TO PARTAKE OF IT
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU I MUTTERED
IT WAS EVIDENT SHE LOVED ME--PROBABLY SHE WAS TIRED OF MR LAWRENCE AND WISHED TO EXCHANGE HIM FOR ME
BUT IN THE FOREGROUND WAS PART OF THE GNARLED TRUNK AND OF THE SPREADING BOUGHS OF A LARGE FOREST-TREE WHOSE FOLIAGE WAS OF A BRILLIANT GOLDEN GREEN--NOT GOLDEN FROM AUTUMNAL MELLOWNESS BUT FROM THE SUNSHINE AND THE VERY IMMATURITY OF THE SCARCE EXPANDED LEAVES
I WENT UP TO THE GARDEN WALL AND STOOD LEANING OVER IT WITH MY EYES FIXED UPON THE LATTICE WONDERING WHAT SHE WAS DOING THINKING OR SUFFERING NOW AND WISHING I COULD SPEAK TO HER BUT ONE WORD OR EVEN CATCH ONE GLIMPSE OF HER BEFORE I WENT
EVEN YOUR BEST FRIENDS WILL NOT BELIEVE IN IT
AND I TOOK HIM HOME--THAT IS TO OUR CLUB--FOR HE WAS AS SUBMISSIVE AS A CHILD--AND PLIED HIM WITH BRANDY-AND-WATER TILL HE BEGAN TO LOOK RATHER BRIGHTER--RATHER MORE ALIVE AT LEAST
FROM ME SAID I
SHE WAS WITH HIM WHEN HE DIED AND HAD ASSISTED HER AUNT TO NURSE HIM DURING THE LAST STAGE OF HIS ILLNESS
IT WOULD BE BETTER THAT HE SHOULD DIE WITH ME THAN THAT HE SHOULD LIVE WITH HIS FATHER
AND NOT TOO LITTLE EITHER
HE GAVE ME NO ACCOUNT OF HIS REPLY EXCEPT TO TELL ME THAT HE HAD NOT ACKNOWLEDGED HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH MY PLACE OF REFUGE BUT RATHER LEFT IT TO BE INFERRED THAT IT WAS QUITE UNKNOWN TO HIM BY SAYING IT WAS USELESS TO APPLY TO HIM OR ANY OTHER OF MY RELATIONS FOR INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT AS IT APPEARED I HAD BEEN DRIVEN TO SUCH EXTREMITY THAT I HAD CONCEALED MY RETREAT EVEN FROM MY BEST FRIENDS
THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN CARE OF MYSELF
I SCARCELY NOTICED IT AT THE TIME BUT AFTERWARDS I WAS LED TO RECALL THIS AND OTHER TRIFLING FACTS OF A SIMILAR NATURE TO MY REMEMBRANCE WHEN--BUT I MUST NOT ANTICIPATE
BUT MR HARGRAVE FOLLOWED ME INTO THE ANTEROOM AND BEFORE I COULD OPEN ITS OUTER DOOR GENTLY LAID HIS HAND UPON THE LOCK
IF HE HAD COME WITH ME I SHOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO GET HOME AGAIN FOR HE LED ME SUCH A ROUND OF RESTLESS DISSIPATION WHILE THERE THAT IN THAT SHORT SPACE OF TIME I WAS QUITE TIRED OUT
I WAS NOT OBLIGED TO ENTER INTO EXPLANATIONS FURTHER THAN I THOUGHT PROPER
YOU'LL WANT SOMEBODY TO CLEAN AND WASH AND COOK WON'T YOU
BUT THIS ONCE I WILL FORGIVE HIM FREELY AND ENTIRELY
HE HAD HAD UNCOMFORTABLE SUSPICIONS ON THAT HEAD HIMSELF I IMAGINED
SHE WAS A VERY SINCERE AND PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN BUT THE TINGE OF RELIGIOUS MELANCHOLY COMMUNICATED A SAD SHADE TO HER BRIEF BLAMELESS LIFE IN SPITE OF MISCONSTRUCTION AND ABUSE HOWEVER WILDFELL HALL SEEMS TO HAVE ATTAINED MORE IMMEDIATE SUCCESS THAN ANYTHING ELSE WRITTEN BY THE SISTERS BEFORE 1848 EXCEPT JANE EYRE IT WENT INTO A SECOND EDITION WITHIN A VERY SHORT TIME OF ITS PUBLICATION AND MESSRS
I MUST LEAVE YOU
ARTHUR DID NOT COME HOME TILL SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER MY RETURN TO GRASSDALE
OH--OH AND LEANING BACK IN HIS SEAT HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS ON HIS SIDES AND GROANED ALOUD
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T SEE WHAT REASON SARAH SHOULD HAVE FOR DECEIVING ME OR HER INFORMANT FOR DECEIVING HER
IF YOU WOULD RATHER REMAIN MY CREDITOR THAN STUFF YOUR PURSE WITH SUCH UNGAINLY HEAVY PIECES,--TELL ME STILL AND I'LL PARDON YOUR BAD TASTE AND WILLINGLY KEEP THE TREASURE TO MYSELF
THE SUFFERER WAS FAST APPROACHING DISSOLUTION--DRAGGED ALMOST TO THE VERGE OF THAT AWFUL CHASM HE TREMBLED TO CONTEMPLATE FROM WHICH NO AGONY OF PRAYERS OR TEARS COULD SAVE HIM
BUT I STOOD TRANSFIXED AND SPEECHLESS ON SEEING HER SEATED THERE LISTENING WITH WHAT SEEMED AN EXULTANT SMILE ON HER FLUSHED FACE TO HIS SOFT MURMURINGS WITH HER HAND QUIETLY SURRENDERED TO HIS CLASP
I MUST LABOUR TO CULTIVATE THIS INESTIMABLE QUALITY
BUT SHE ALLOWED HE WAS NO SAINT
AND WHAT BESIDES DO YOU HOPE I HOPE YOU WILL BOTH LOVE EACH OTHER AND BOTH BE HAPPY THANKS
AND SURELY THE FELLOW WAS BORN UNDER AN UNLUCKY STAR FOR HE ALWAYS LOST THRICE WHERE HE GAINED ONCE
BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT HIM FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE
I SENT INTO THE TOWN TO SEEK ONE
I TOLD HER I WAS BETTER BUT TO EXCUSE MY APPEARANCE ADMITTED I HAD HAD A RESTLESS NIGHT
BUT TILL LATELY I HAVE NOT HAD VERY MUCH TO DO WITH HIM
MY WISH HOWEVER WAS NOT GRATIFIED
MAKING NO USE OF IT BUT TO TORMENT ME AND RUIN THE CHILD
INSTEAD OF BEING HUMBLED AND PURIFIED BY MY AFFLICTIONS I FEEL THAT THEY ARE TURNING MY NATURE INTO GALL
HAD I KILLED HIM?--AN ICY HAND SEEMED TO GRASP MY HEART AND CHECK ITS PULSATION AS I BENT OVER HIM GAZING WITH BREATHLESS INTENSITY UPON THE GHASTLY UPTURNED FACE
JESTS INDEED
LADY LOWBOROUGH WAS BESIDE HER HUSBAND BENDING OVER HIM AS HE SAT WITH HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER SOFTLY TALKING AND SMILING IN HIS FACE
JANUARY AT LENGTH WAS ALMOST OVER--A FEW MORE WEEKS AND THEN CERTAIN DESPAIR OR RENEWAL OF HOPE WOULD PUT AN END TO THIS LONG AGONY OF SUSPENSE
IMPATIENCE THAT INCREASED IN PROPORTION AS HIS ABSENCE WAS PROLONGED
I'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MY KNEES TREMBLED UNDER ME
LET US HAVE NO YOUNG LADY'S AFFECTATIONS AND CAPRICES BUT SPEAK OUT AT ONCE I WILL BUT ONLY TO REPEAT WHAT I SAID BEFORE THAT I AM CERTAIN WE WERE NOT MADE FOR EACH OTHER YOU REALLY THINK SO I DO BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ME--YOU WISH FOR A FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE--A LONGER TIME TO NO I DON'T
BUT I NEVER COULD AND THEREFORE BUT WHY NOT
IN LOVE AFFAIRS THERE IS NO MEDIATOR LIKE A MERRY SIMPLE-HEARTED CHILD--EVER READY TO CEMENT DIVIDED HEARTS TO SPAN THE UNFRIENDLY GULF OF CUSTOM TO MELT THE ICE OF COLD RESERVE AND OVERTHROW THE SEPARATING WALLS OF DREAD FORMALITY AND PRIDE
GONE OUT WITH GRIMSBY AS YOU KNOW SAID HATTERSLEY SUPPRESSING A LAUGH WHICH BROKE FORTH AS HE CONCLUDED THE SENTENCE
SHE'S WORN TO A SHADOW ALREADY WHAT ARE HER SUFFERINGS TO MINE SAID THE POOR INVALID
LORD AND LADY LOWBOROUGH HAVE NOW BEEN MARRIED ABOVE EIGHT MONTHS
AND THERE I WALKED RAPIDLY UP AND DOWN THINKING OF MY BITTER THOUGHTS ALONE
IT SEEMED TO REVIVE HIM CONSIDERABLY
I WAS THE VERY LIFE AND PROP OF THE COMMUNITY THEY DO ME THE HONOUR TO SAY AND I HAVE SHAMEFULLY BETRAYED MY TRUST YOU MAY JOIN THEM AGAIN IF YOU LIKE SAID I SOMEWHAT PIQUED AT THE SORROWFUL TONE OF HIS DISCOURSE
I HAVE BEEN NURSING OUR POOR LITTLE BABY WHO IS VERY FAR FROM WELL AND I COULD NOT LEAVE HIM TILL I GOT HIM TO SLEEP OH TO BE SURE YOU'RE OVERFLOWING WITH KINDNESS AND PITY FOR EVERYTHING BUT ME AND WHY SHOULD I PITY YOU
WHAT A SCENE WAS THIS
BUT SHE WOULDN'T LET IT GO AND SO THEN THEY FELL OUT
WE SAT SILENT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES
AS WELL AS BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS NEVER COMING TO SEE ME WHEN MR HUNTINGDON IS AT HOME
HERE IS MR BOARHAM HELEN SAID SHE
WHAT MINGLED PLEASURE AND DISSATISFACTION I HAD HAD IN THE RESULT OF MY LABOURS!--PLEASURE FOR THE LIKENESS I HAD CAUGHT
I FOUND HER IN THE ROOM ALONE WHEN I WENT DOWN TO BREAKFAST
IT SEEMED AS IF HE WAS PRESUMING UPON THE ABSENCE AND NEGLECT OF MY HUSBAND AND INSINUATING EVEN MORE THAN THE TRUTH AGAINST HIM
THE GENTLEMEN WITH TWO EXCEPTIONS ABOVE TWO MONTHS
HER CHAIR WAS VACANT
NOT EVEN THE GENTLEMEN THEMSELVES I IMAGINE
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SAID SO AT ONCE HE DENIED IT
I'VE KNOWN HIM SINCE HE WAS QUITE A YOUNG GENTLEMAN
IT MAY HE PARTLY JEST AND PARTLY FLATTERY BUT STILL BUT STILL YOU THINK IT MAY BE TRUTH IF I DO THINK THERE IS ANY MIXTURE OF TRUTH IN IT IT IS NOT FROM CONFIDENCE IN MY OWN POWERS BUT IN HIS NATURAL GOODNESS
AND IT GRIEVES ME TO SEE YOU CHERISHING FALSE HOPES AND WASTING YOUR STRENGTH IN USELESS EFFORTS FOR HYPOCRITE I EXCLAIMED
THOSE ARE BAD WORDS AND WICKED PEOPLE OFTEN SAY THEM OF OTHERS BETTER THAN THEMSELVES
THERE'S MUCH TO BE SAID ON BOTH SIDES AND NOW I THINK UPON IT HUNTINGDON OFTEN REGRETS THAT YOU ARE NOT MORE LIKE HER SCOUNDRELLY DOG THAT HE IS AND YOU SEE AFTER ALL YOU CAN'T REFORM HIM
SHE MADE NO GRIM FIGHT WITH SUFFERING AND DEATH AS DID EMILY
BUT WILL YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO INFORM ME WHY YOU MAKE THIS DISTINCTION
WELL WE OUGHT TO BE CHARITABLE YOU KNOW AUNT--BESIDES I DON'T THINK IT IS FALSE
YOU HAVE DONE RIGHT HE SAID IN A TONE OF UNQUALIFIED APPROBATION WHILE HIS FACE BRIGHTENED INTO ALMOST A SUNNY EXPRESSION
BUT I BENT IT OVER MY LETTER AND WENT ON FOLDING IT UP AS SHE PROCEEDED
6TH.--HE HAS NOT ALLUDED TO THIS MOMENTOUS MYSTERY SINCE AND I HAVE SEEN NO REASON TO REPENT OF MY UNWILLINGNESS TO HEAR IT
IF I SHOULD FIND HER WITHIN--BUT ALAS
I SUPPOSE THERE'S NOTHING YOU WOULDN'T DO FOR ME NOW YOU KNOW SAID I A LITTLE SURPRISED AT HIS MANNER THAT I AM WILLING TO DO ANYTHING I CAN TO RELIEVE YOU YES NOW MY IMMACULATE ANGEL
AND I REPEAT I DREAD THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS ARRIVAL
BUT IT APPEARS I AM TO DO NEITHER
IF I DON'T WANT HIM SOMEBODY DOES MAYHAP WINKING AT ME BESIDES HE'S A PRETTY TIDY FORTUNE PEGGY YOU KNOW--NOT SUCH A CATCH AS WILMOT
I TREAT HIM WITH UNIMPEACHABLE CIVILITY GIVE UP MY CONVENIENCE TO HIS WHEREVER IT MAY REASONABLY BE DONE AND CONSULT HIM IN A BUSINESS-LIKE WAY ON HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS DEFERRING TO HIS PLEASURE AND JUDGMENT EVEN WHEN I KNOW THE LATTER TO BE INFERIOR TO MY OWN
TAKE THEM AWAY BENSON SAID I
YOU HAVE SHAMEFULLY WRONGED YOURSELF BODY AND SOUL AND ME TOO
SO THE LITTLE FELLOW CAME DOWN EVERY EVENING IN SPITE OF HIS CROSS MAMMA AND LEARNED TO TIPPLE WINE LIKE PAPA TO SWEAR LIKE MR HATTERSLEY AND TO HAVE HIS OWN WAY LIKE A MAN AND SENT MAMMA TO THE DEVIL WHEN SHE TRIED TO PREVENT HIM
HIS EXCUSES ARE VAGUE AND INSUFFICIENT
BUT I SUPPRESSED ALL OUTWARD MANIFESTATIONS OF IT AND ONLY BIT MY LIP AND PRETENDED TO ARRANGE MY WORK
BECAUSE I CANNOT BE HAPPY HERE WHY NOT BECAUSE MY WIFE DOESN'T LOVE ME SHE WOULD LOVE YOU WITH ALL HER HEART IF YOU DESERVED IT WHAT MUST I DO TO DESERVE IT THIS SEEMED HUMBLE AND EARNEST ENOUGH
I INSTANTLY ROSE AND LEFT THE ROOM TO GO IN SEARCH OF RACHEL AND DEMAND AN EXPLANATION OF HER WORDS
AND HE WAS PERFECTLY RIGHT ADDED I
NO--IN ANOTHER YEAR REPLIED SHE GENTLY DISENGAGING HERSELF FROM MY EMBRACE BUT STILL FONDLY CLASPING MY HAND
I HAD THOUGHT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR LAST MEETING WOULD HAVE LEFT SUCH AN IMPRESSION ON HIS MIND AS TO RENDER HIM COLD AND DISTANT EVER AFTER
DON'T ASTONISH HIS INFANTILE BRAIN WITH YOUR MADNESS BUT IT IS TIME TO BRING MY NARRATIVE TO A CLOSE
ALL THE HOUSE IS STILL
AND IF HE DID IT IS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE HE WOULD BREAK HIS BONES IN THAT WAY
BUT WHY HAVE YOU CALLED IT FERNLEY MANOR CUMBERLAND INSTEAD OF WILDFELL HALL SHIRE I ASKED ALLUDING TO THE NAME SHE HAD TRACED IN SMALL CHARACTERS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CANVAS
IF REGARDLESS OF THAT COUNSEL YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE A BEAST OF YOURSELF NOW AND OVER-EAT AND OVER-DRINK YOURSELF TILL YOU TURN THE GOOD VICTUALS INTO POISON WHO IS TO BLAME IF HEREAFTER WHILE YOU ARE SUFFERING THE TORMENTS OF YESTERDAY'S GLUTTONY AND DRUNKENNESS YOU SEE MORE TEMPERATE MEN SITTING DOWN TO ENJOY THEMSELVES AT THAT SPLENDID ENTERTAINMENT WHICH YOU ARE UNABLE TO TASTE MOST TRUE MY PATRON SAINT
BUT THE BOOK'S TRUTH SO FAR AS IT IS TRUE IS SCARCELY THE TRUTH OF IMAGINATION
BUT MY AFTER-THOUGHT WAS IF IT IS WRONG SURELY ARTHUR'S IS THE FAULT NOT MINE AND INDEED I KNOW NOT WHETHER AT THE TIME IT WAS NOT FOR HIM RATHER THAN MYSELF THAT I BLUSHED
MATE HE ADDED QUIETLY BUT WITH EVIDENT DELIGHT
TO AVOID BEING SEEN FROM THE WINDOWS I WENT DOWN A QUIET LITTLE AVENUE THAT SKIRTED ONE SIDE OF THE INCLOSURE AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH WAS A SEAT EMBOWERED IN ROSES AND HONEYSUCKLES
HATTERSLEY LAUGHED AND JESTED IN SPITE OF THE LITTLE WINE HE HAD BEEN SUFFERED TO IMBIBE BUT STILL BEHAVED AS WELL AS HE KNEW HOW
BUT NOTHING CAN INDUCE HIM TO BEHOLD IT IN THE PROPER LIGHT
BUT THEN HELEN WON'T HEAR OF THAT MATCH
MRS MAXWELL THEN WITHDREW TO TAKE OFF HER THINGS
BUT THEY SINK INTO HIS STUPEFIED HEART AND MAKE HIM PAUSE AND PONDER AND ABSTAIN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE I COULD SAY
I WENT A LITTLE OUT OF MY WAY TO SPEAK TO HIM
HE HAD INVITED HUNTINGDON AND HIS FRIEND LORD LOWBOROUGH BEFORE WE LEFT LONDON AND NOTHING NOW REMAINED BUT TO FIX THE DAY FOR THEIR COMING
YOU NEVER HOPED FOR SUCH A GLORIOUS OPPORTUNITY NOW SHALL I STAY WITH YOU SAID I AS I REPLACED THE GLASS ON THE TABLE
THEREBY PREPARING THE SOIL FOR THOSE VICES HE HAS SO SUCCESSFULLY CULTIVATED IN HIS OWN PERVERTED NATURE
YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND SHE'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT WILL YOU OBLIGE ME HELEN CONTINUED SHE
THEN TAKING OFF HIS HAT HE ADDED
YOU DON'T HATE ME YOU KNOW YES I DO--AT THIS MOMENT NOT YOU
AND HOW COULD I ENGAGE HER BROTHER IN MY BEHALF
THIS IS AS IT SHOULD BE
I HAD VENTURED TO GIVE MORE OF THE BRIGHT VERDURE OF SPRING OR EARLY SUMMER TO THE GRASS AND FOLIAGE THAN IS COMMONLY ATTEMPTED IN PAINTING
FOR IF ARTHUR DISREGARDED SUCH INTIMATIONS AS WELL I MUST NOT DETAIN YOU FROM YOUR LADY OR WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT MRS HUNTINGDON IS ALONE HE WOULD INSIST UPON LEAVING THE TABLE HIMSELF TO JOIN ME AND HIS HOST HOWEVER UNWILLINGLY WAS OBLIGED TO FOLLOW
IT IS TOO TRUE RACHEL SAID I ANSWERING HER SAD LOOKS RATHER THAN HER WORDS
WHAT YOU FEEL AT THIS MOMENT I SUPPOSE SAID LADY LOWBOROUGH WITH A MALICIOUS SMILE FIXING HER EYES UPON HER COUSIN'S DISTRESSED COUNTENANCE
FOR WITHOUT A GRAIN OF CEREMONY SHE TOOK IT FROM ME
I HAVE SEEN NOTHING
IS TROUBLED WITH NO FEARS NO SCRUPLES CONCERNING HIS SON'S FUTURE WELFARE
THE BLEAK WINDS HAVE NOT BLANCHED IT OR BROKEN ITS STEM AND THE KEEN FROST HAS NOT BLIGHTED IT
SO DIFFERENT TO ALL YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DO YOU THINK MA'AM I CAN'T BEAR WHAT MY MISSIS CAN
YOUR BROTHER WILL NOT HELP US I SAID
WE WILL WRITE EVERY DAY
HER CLEAR DARK EYES WERE FIXED ON MINE WITH A GAZE SO INTENSELY EARNEST THAT THEY BOUND ME LIKE A SPELL
AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I SHALL BE GLAD OF A LITTLE REST
I INQUIRED AT THE PORTER'S LODGE IF MRS HUNTINGDON WERE AT HOME
THERE WAS WORK BEFORE ME
WILL YOU HELEN CONTINUED THE SPEAKER
AND JUST AS I WRENCHED THE PORTFOLIO FROM HIS HAND HE DEFTLY ABSTRACTED THE GREATER PART OF ITS CONTENTS AND AFTER TURNING THEM OVER A MOMENT HE CRIED OUT,--'BLESS MY STARS HERE'S ANOTHER AND SLIPPED A SMALL OVAL OF IVORY PAPER INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET--A COMPLETE MINIATURE PORTRAIT THAT I HAD SKETCHED WITH SUCH TOLERABLE SUCCESS AS TO BE INDUCED TO COLOUR IT WITH GREAT PAINS AND CARE
BUT I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF YOUR BEING THERE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AS YOU CALL THEM POOH POOH YOU SILLY GIRL
OF COURSE THE WRETCHED SUFFERER'S TEMPER WAS NOT IMPROVED BY THIS CALAMITY--IN FACT I SUSPECT IT WAS WELL NIGH INSUPPORTABLE THOUGH HIS KIND NURSE DID NOT COMPLAIN
AND I KNOW ENOUGH OF YOU MRS HUNTINGDON TO THINK THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS THE MOST ENVIABLE MAN IN THE WORLD AND I SHOULD BE THE NEXT IF YOU WOULD DEEM ME WORTHY OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP IF YOU KNEW MORE OF ME YOU WOULD NOT THINK IT OR IF YOU DID YOU WOULD NOT SAY IT AND EXPECT ME TO BE FLATTERED BY THE COMPLIMENT I STEPPED BACKWARD AS I SPOKE
ALL MY FORMER OCCUPATIONS SEEM SO TEDIOUS AND DULL MY FORMER AMUSEMENTS SO INSIPID AND UNPROFITABLE
MAMMA HAS LEFT OFF HER WIDOW'S CAP IN HONOUR OF UNCLE'S MARRIAGE OBSERVED ARTHUR READING MY LOOKS WITH A CHILD'S MINGLED SIMPLICITY AND QUICKNESS OF OBSERVATION
HE FRIGHTENS ME WITH HIS ABRUPT MANNERS AND STRANGE HECTORING WAYS AND I DREAD THE THOUGHTS OF MARRYING HIM
AND GLANCING IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE THE SOUND PROCEEDED I BEHELD A TINY HAND ELEVATED ABOVE THE WALL
AND HAD THEY ALL TURNED THEIR BACKS UPON HER
YOU KNOW ROSE IN ALL HOUSEHOLD MATTERS WE HAVE ONLY TWO THINGS TO CONSIDER FIRST WHAT'S PROPER TO BE DONE
HE IS NOT SO LIGHT-HEADED AS TO BE IRRESPONSIBLE
WITHOUT A WORD OF COMMENT OR FURTHER QUESTIONING I ROSE AND DARTED FROM THE ROOM AND OUT OF THE HOUSE
SUCH A RECEPTION WAS HARDLY CALCULATED TO DIMINISH THE DIFFICULTIES OF MY UNENVIABLE TASK
I HAVE NEVER REPROACHED THE FORMER BUT ONCE AND THAT WAS FOR LAUGHING AT LORD LOWBOROUGH'S DEPRESSED AND ANXIOUS COUNTENANCE ONE EVENING WHEN THEY HAD BOTH BEEN PARTICULARLY PROVOKING
BUT WHEN WE DO SPEAK OR CONVERSE TOGETHER IT IS WITH THE UTMOST CIVILITY EVEN APPARENT CORDIALITY ON HER PART
THERE IS NO ONE TO MEET BUT OURSELVES SAID HE
I TOLD HIM
I WISH YOU TO MAKE IT YOURS LIKEWISE FOR HELEN IS ATTACHED TO THE PLACE AND TO ME--AS I AM TO HER
INDEED
WHAT DO YOU WISH ASKED I ANNOYED AT THE VINDICTIVE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE
THERE WAS A PAUSE OF WHICH ARTHUR THOUGHT HE MIGHT VENTURE TO AVAIL HIMSELF TO INTRODUCE HIS HANDSOME YOUNG SETTER AND SHOW ME HOW WONDERFULLY IT WAS GROWN AND IMPROVED AND TO ASK AFTER THE WELFARE OF ITS FATHER SANCHO
AND HE WAS IN THE RIGHT OF IT YOU WILL SAY
LORD LOWBOROUGH HAD ENTERED A MINUTE OR TWO BEFORE UNOBSERVED BY ANYONE BUT ME AND HAD BEEN STANDING BEFORE THE DOOR GRIMLY SURVEYING THE COMPANY
IF GOD HAD HEARD HALF YOUR INVOCATIONS OF THAT KIND YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HELL LONG BEFORE NOW--AND YOU CANNOT MAKE AMENDS FOR THE PAST BY DOING YOUR DUTY FOR THE FUTURE INASMUCH AS YOUR DUTY IS ONLY WHAT YOU OWE TO YOUR MAKER AND YOU CANNOT DO MORE THAN FULFIL IT
I TURNED BACK AND STOOD AWAITING HIS COMMANDS
THE TRUTH WAS HE LIKED ME VERY WELL BUT HE WAS FULLY AWARE THAT A UNION BETWEEN MRS HUNTINGDON AND ME WOULD BE WHAT THE WORLD CALLS A MESALLIANCE
THE COACHMAN MOST EXECRABLY CAUTIOUS
WELL REPLIED HE I THOUGHT OF LORD LOWBOROUGH FOR ONE
AND THE MEAGRE OLD MAID-SERVANT THAT OPENED THE DOOR USHERED US INTO AN APARTMENT SUCH AS ROSE HAD DESCRIBED TO ME AS THE SCENE OF HER FIRST INTRODUCTION TO MRS GRAHAM A TOLERABLY SPACIOUS AND LOFTY ROOM BUT OBSCURELY LIGHTED BY THE OLD-FASHIONED WINDOWS THE CEILING PANELS AND CHIMNEY-PIECE OF GRIM BLACK OAK--THE LATTER ELABORATELY BUT NOT VERY TASTEFULLY CARVED,--WITH TABLES AND CHAIRS TO MATCH AN OLD BOOKCASE ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIRE-PLACE STOCKED WITH A MOTLEY ASSEMBLAGE OF BOOKS AND AN ELDERLY CABINET PIANO ON THE OTHER
FOR SHE DIDN'T SEEM VERY DISCONSOLATE AFTER ALL
I MUST BE MY OWN MAID AND MY CHILD'S NURSE WHAT SIGNIFIES REPLIED SHE IN SOME EXCITEMENT
YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID
MY HEART WAS SPLITTING WITH HATRED
WON'T YOU LET ME IN HELEN SAID HE
MRS HUNTINGDON SAID HE AS I PASSED WILL YOU ALLOW ME ONE WORD WHAT IS IT THEN
IT WAS NO DOUBT SOME EXAGGERATED TALE ABOUT MY UNFORTUNATE HUSBAND THAT HE WISHED TO MAKE THE MOST OF TO SERVE HIS OWN BAD PURPOSES
THE TIMIDLY SPOKEN SUGGESTION HAD BEEN INTENDED FOR MY EAR ALONE
IS IT THAT THEY THINK IT A DUTY TO BE CONTINUALLY TALKING PURSUED SHE
AND HE AT PRESENT WAS QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS OF THE DAY
I WENT TO THE FIRE AND LEANT MY HEAD AGAINST THE CHIMNEY-PIECE
I SAW THEM ALL CONSUMED
MISSIS CAN'T SEE ANY ONE TO-DAY SIR--SHE'S POORLY SAID SHE IN ANSWER TO MY INQUIRY FOR MRS GRAHAM
SHALL I GET YOU A GLASS OF WINE SAID HE
I MUST ASK HIS PARDON TO-DAY AND ENTREAT HIM TO BE LENIENT IN HIS ACCUSATION IF THE REVELATION MUST BE MADE
BUT I AM NOT SURE HER DOUBTS WERE ENTIRELY WITHOUT SAGACITY
WHILE SHE DRESSED ME I EXPLAINED TO HER MY INTENTIONS AND WHAT ASSISTANCE I SHOULD REQUIRE FROM HER AND TOLD HER WHICH OF MY THINGS SHE WAS TO PACK UP AND WHAT SHE WAS TO LEAVE BEHIND FOR HERSELF AS I HAD NO OTHER MEANS OF RECOMPENSING HER FOR THIS SUDDEN DISMISSAL AFTER HER LONG AND FAITHFUL SERVICE
SHE HAD ENDED HER SONG BUT STILL SHE SAT AT THE INSTRUMENT
FOR HIS GOUT WAS WORSE
AND SO IT IS NO WONDER THAT HIS SON SHOULD MAKE IT HIS CHIEF DELIGHT TO SPEND THEM WHICH WAS ACCORDINGLY THE CASE UNTIL MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOU DEAR HELEN TAUGHT ME OTHER VIEWS AND NOBLER AIMS
MY PRESENCE DID NOT APPEAR TO AGITATE OR IRRITATE HIM AS BEFORE AND HE ACCEPTED MY SERVICES QUIETLY WITHOUT ANY BITTER REMARKS
CHAPTER LII THE TARDY GIG HAD OVERTAKEN ME AT LAST
THAT'S THE PLAN--"LET YOUR MODERATION BE KNOWN UNTO ALL MEN BUT IN REVENGE I FOLLOWED ELIZA INTO THE DIMLY-LIGHTED PASSAGE WHERE UNDER PRETENCE OF HELPING HER ON WITH HER SHAWL I FEAR I MUST PLEAD GUILTY TO SNATCHING A KISS BEHIND HER FATHER'S BACK WHILE HE WAS ENVELOPING HIS THROAT AND CHIN IN THE FOLDS OF A MIGHTY COMFORTER
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT REPLIED HE GRAVELY
IT SHALL I ANSWERED
MAMMA I COULDN'T FIND THE BOOK IN EITHER OF THE PLACES YOU TOLD ME TO LOOK FOR IT THERE WAS A CONSCIOUS SOMETHING IN MAMMA'S SMILE THAT SEEMED TO SAY NO DEAR I KNEW YOU COULD NOT BUT RACHEL GOT IT FOR ME AT LAST
PREPARATIONS FOR THE IMPORTANT EVENT ARE ALREADY GOING ON AROUND ME
LITTLE ARTHUR HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HIS FATHER BUT THIRTEEN MONTHS OF ABSENCE DURING WHICH HE HAD SELDOM BEEN PERMITTED TO HEAR A WORD ABOUT HIM OR HARDLY TO WHISPER HIS NAME HAD RENDERED HIM SOMEWHAT SHY
AND A CHILD IN SUCH A CASE WOULD BE LIKELY TO HAVE A STRONG CURIOSITY TO TASTE AND TRY THE EFFECT OF WHAT HAS BEEN SO LAUDED AND ENJOYED BY OTHERS SO STRICTLY FORBIDDEN TO HIMSELF--WHICH CURIOSITY WOULD GENERALLY BE GRATIFIED ON THE FIRST CONVENIENT OPPORTUNITY
I THREATEN MAMMA SOMETIMES THAT I'LL RUN AWAY AND DISGRACE THE FAMILY BY EARNING MY OWN LIVELIHOOD IF SHE TORMENTS ME ANY MORE
THE FIRST OF THESE COMMUNICATIONS BROUGHT INTELLIGENCE OF A SERIOUS RELAPSE IN MR HUNTINGDON'S ILLNESS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF HIS OWN INFATUATION IN PERSISTING IN THE INDULGENCE OF HIS APPETITE FOR STIMULATING DRINK
WHEN HELEN WAS DIVESTED OF HER LUGUBRIOUS BONNET AND VEIL HER HEAVY WINTER CLOAK C SHE LOOKED SO LIKE HERSELF THAT I KNEW NOT HOW TO BEAR IT
SHE WAS CONSIDERED A BEAUTY BESIDES
AT LAST HE STARTLED ME BY SUDDENLY RAISING HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW AND DEMANDING IN A HORRIFIED WHISPER WITH HIS EYES STILL FIXED UPON ME WHO IS IT IT IS HELEN HUNTINGDON SAID I QUIETLY RISING AT THE SAME TIME AND REMOVING TO A LESS CONSPICUOUS POSITION
HER COMPLEXION WAS REMARKABLY FAIR AND BRILLIANT HER HEAD SMALL NECK LONG CHIN WELL TURNED BUT VERY SHORT LIPS THIN AND RED EYES CLEAR HAZEL QUICK AND PENETRATING BUT ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF POETRY OR FEELING
COLCHESTER LONDON ETON ENGLAND
IT IS IN YOUR POWER TO SECURE THIS INESTIMABLE BLESSING FOR LIFE--A WORTHY AND EXCELLENT HUSBAND WHO LOVES YOU TENDERLY BUT NOT TOO FONDLY SO AS TO BLIND HIM TO YOUR FAULTS AND WILL BE YOUR GUIDE THROUGHOUT LIFE'S PILGRIMAGE AND YOUR PARTNER IN ETERNAL BLISS
IT IS SPOILING THE CHILD
I COULD ONLY OBSERVE THE PICTURE DURING THE FEW BRIEF SECONDS THAT RACHEL HELD THE DOOR FOR OUR ADMITTANCE
AND MY BROTHER TOO WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN A STRANGER
CHAPTER XLIX THOUGH MR LAWRENCE'S HEALTH WAS NOW QUITE RE-ESTABLISHED MY VISITS TO WOODFORD WERE AS UNREMITTING AS EVER
GOOD-BY--I NEEDN'T WISH YOU A PLEASANT JOURNEY
THEN WIPED HIS STREAMING FOREHEAD AND ADVANCING TOWARDS ME WITH A KIND OF UNNATURAL COMPOSURE SAID IN A DEEP ALMOST SEPULCHRAL TONE,--'MRS HUNTINGDON I MUST LEAVE YOU TO-MORROW TO-MORROW I REPEATED
AND CONFIRM THEM AS FAR AS YOU CAN
THUS MADAM YOU SEE THE EVIL OF ABSENCE OF MIND--OF THINKING TOO MUCH WHILE ENGAGED IN THE COMMON CONCERNS OF LIFE
IT SEEMED LIKE SACRILEGE TO REVERT TO THEM NOW BUT I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THEM
IT WAS A VIEW OF WILDFELL HALL AS SEEN AT EARLY MORNING FROM THE FIELD BELOW RISING IN DARK RELIEF AGAINST A SKY OF CLEAR SILVERY BLUE WITH A FEW RED STREAKS ON THE HORIZON FAITHFULLY DRAWN AND COLOURED AND VERY ELEGANTLY AND ARTISTICALLY HANDLED
AND FOR A WONDER WALTER CAME DOWN TO JOIN HER IN THE BEGINNING OF JUNE AND STAYED TILL NEAR THE CLOSE OF AUGUST
BUT YOU MUST PRAY FOR YOURSELF HIS LIPS MOVED BUT EMITTED NO SOUND;--THEN HIS LOOKS BECAME UNSETTLED
LET YOUR EYES BE BLIND TO ALL EXTERNAL ATTRACTIONS YOUR EARS DEAF TO ALL THE FASCINATIONS OF FLATTERY AND LIGHT DISCOURSE.--THESE ARE NOTHING--AND WORSE THAN NOTHING--SNARES AND WILES OF THE TEMPTER TO LURE THE THOUGHTLESS TO THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION
AND SO IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION I'LL ACCOMPANY YOU HOME
SO I JUST LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW TO SCREW UP MY COURAGE AND THEN PULLED OUT THE BOOK TURNED ROUND AND PUT IT INTO HER HAND WITH THIS SHORT EXPLANATION
I PRESUME THE PERSON YOU ALLUDE TO IS MR LAWRENCE
BUT HE STILL PRESERVES A RESOLUTE DETERMINATION TO SEE HIMSELF A MARRIED MAN BEFORE THE YEAR IS OUT
MR LAWRENCE SAT WITH HIS ELBOW ON THE TABLE CARELESSLY PLAYING WITH HIS HALF-EMPTY WINE-GLASS AND COVERTLY SMILING TO HIMSELF
TELL ME ALL YOUR WANTS AND I WILL TRY TO SATISFY THEM
BUT THEN HE NEVER WILL DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND
KEEP YOUR BAD TIDINGS TO YOURSELF
JUST AS I HAD RETIRED FROM THE DINING-ROOM WITH THE LADIES BEFORE THE DOOR WAS CLOSED UPON US ARTHUR EXCLAIMED,--'NOW THEN MY LADS WHAT SAY YOU TO A REGULAR JOLLIFICATION MILICENT GLANCED AT ME WITH A HALF-REPROACHFUL LOOK AS IF I COULD HINDER IT
IS IT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF BEING ABLE AND WILLING TO RESIST TEMPTATION
BUT I LISTENED INTENTLY FOR HER REPLY
THEY NEED NOT KNOW HE BEGAN
AND I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD ACCEPTED HIM
THEY SAW ME
AND IN SPITE OF MY AUNT'S FOREBODINGS AND MY OWN UNSPOKEN FEARS I TRUST WE SHALL BE HAPPY YET
WRETCH THAT I WAS TO HARBOUR THAT DETESTABLE IDEA FOR A MOMENT
IT IS NOT FOUNDED ON MERE PERSONAL PIQUE
WHEREAS I--WELL I'VE TAKEN THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS THEY HAVE TO-NIGHT AND YOU SEE I'M PERFECTLY STEADY
HAPPILY FOR MY DISCRETION PERHAPS FOR MY ENJOYMENT DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WE WERE SPEEDILY SUMMONED TO THE REPAST--A VERY RESPECTABLE COLLATION WHICH ROSE ASSISTED BY MISS WILSON AND ELIZA WHO HAVING SHARED HER SEAT IN THE CARRIAGE HAD ARRIVED WITH HER A LITTLE BEFORE THE REST HAD SET OUT UPON AN ELEVATED PLATFORM OVERLOOKING THE SEA AND SHELTERED FROM THE HOT SUN BY A SHELVING ROCK AND OVERHANGING TREES
FOR HERE YOU SEE THE CHILD IS DELIVERED AT ONCE FROM TEMPTATION
I'LL BE SATISFIED WITH FLESH AND BLOOD TOO--ONLY THE SPIRIT MUST SHINE THROUGH AND PREDOMINATE
I THEN WROTE THREE LETTERS OF ADIEU
FIRST VEERING ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS COURSE BUT THE MOMENT I WAS OUT OF SIGHT OF MY FAIR TORMENTOR CUTTING AWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY JUST AS A BIRD MIGHT FLY OVER PASTURE-LAND AND FALLOW AND STUBBLE AND LANE CLEARING HEDGES AND DITCHES AND HURDLES TILL I CAME TO THE YOUNG SQUIRE'S GATES
OH WHY DID I LEAVE HIM
THE MESSAGE WAS SUCH AS I EXPECTED--A POLITE INTIMATION THAT MR LAWRENCE COULD SEE NO ONE
BUT DO NOT WRONG ME BY SUPPOSING THAT I COULD CONTINUE MY FRIENDSHIP AND ESTEEM TO A MAN WHO COULD SO INFAMOUSLY SO IMPIOUSLY FORSAKE AND INJURE ONE SO TRANSCENDENTLY--WELL I WON'T SPEAK OF IT
BUT SOMEHOW THERE'S SUCH A REPULSION BETWEEN THE GOOD LADY AND ME THAT I NEVER COULD BRING MYSELF UP TO THE SCRATCH ABOUT THE THIRD WEEK IN AUGUST ARTHUR SET OUT FOR SCOTLAND AND MR HARGRAVE ACCOMPANIED HIM THITHER TO MY PRIVATE SATISFACTION
AS TO WHETHER THE NAME BE REAL OR FICTITIOUS IT CANNOT GREATLY SIGNIFY TO THOSE WHO KNOW HIM ONLY BY HIS WORKS
AND IF MY CHEEK GLOWED LIKE FIRE IT WAS RATHER AT THE QUESTION THAN THE INFORMATION IT CONVEYED
AND I TRUSTED SHE HAD ALTERED HER COURSE HE CONTINUED GAZING FROM THE WINDOW WHILE I SPOKE AND DID NOT ANSWER BUT STUNG BY THE RECOLLECTIONS MY WORDS AWAKENED STAMPED HIS FOOT UPON THE FLOOR GROUND HIS TEETH AND CORRUGATED HIS BROW LIKE ONE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ACUTE PHYSICAL PAIN
YOU HAVEN'T A GOOD WORD FOR ANYBODY--FRIENDS AND STRANGERS EQUALS AND INFERIORS--IT'S ALL THE SAME
AND STARTING UP I THREW MYSELF ON MY KNEES BEFORE HIM AND CLASPING HIS NERVELESS HAND BETWEEN MY OWN CONTINUED
OR WHAT ADVICE--EXCEPT THAT IT IS BETTER TO MAKE A BOLD STAND NOW THOUGH AT THE EXPENSE OF DISAPPOINTING AND ANGERING BOTH MOTHER AND BROTHER AND LOVER THAN TO DEVOTE YOUR WHOLE LIFE HEREAFTER TO MISERY AND VAIN REGRET
ALL HIS FRIENDS HAD NOT FORSAKEN HIM
IT WAS WELL HE DID FOR LORD LOWBOROUGH MOROSE AND MOODY AS HE SEEMED WAS NOT THE MAN FOR A BACHELOR'S LIFE
ABOUT THAT TIME HE FREQUENTLY CALLED AT GRASSDALE AND OFTEN DINED WITH US ON WHICH OCCASIONS I FEAR ARTHUR WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE CAST PRUDENCE AND DECORUM TO THE WINDS AND MADE A NIGHT OF IT AS OFTEN AS HIS FRIEND WOULD HAVE CONSENTED TO JOIN HIM IN THAT EXALTED PASTIME
FOR MILICENT OBSERVING THAT I MUST BE TIRED OF HER DAUBS AND SCRATCHES BEGGED I WOULD JOIN THE COMPANY NOW AND DEFER THE EXAMINATION OF THE REMAINDER TO ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
IT WAS ALL THE MORE SUITABLE TO MY FRAME OF MIND
AT LENGTH OUR WALK WAS ENDED
AND ALL I WANT IS TO PERSUADE FREDERICK TO BE OF THE SAME MIND AS MYSELF
OR THAT YOU HOPE SHE WILL PARDON YOUR OFFENCE YOU SILLY GIRL
WHAT A GOOD THING IT IS TO BE ABLE TO COMMAND ONE'S TEMPER
AND YOU DO LOVE ME HELEN SAID I NOT DOUBTING THE FACT BUT WISHING TO HEAR IT CONFIRMED BY HER OWN ACKNOWLEDGMENT
FOR HE WAS NOW MUCH MORE HARDY AND ACTIVE THAN WHEN HE FIRST ENTERED THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND HE DID NOT LIKE BEING IN THE CARRIAGE WITH STRANGERS WHILE ALL HIS FOUR FRIENDS MAMMA AND SANCHO AND MR MARKHAM AND MISS MILLWARD WERE ON FOOT JOURNEYING FAR BEHIND OR PASSING THROUGH DISTANT FIELDS AND LANES
HE WAS EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO GRANT THE REQUEST BUT WHILE HE HESITATED I SNATCHED IT FROM HIS HAND
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING OF YOUR HUSBAND MRS HUNTINGDON SAID HE
OH YOU'RE A SWEET ONE SO SAYING HE GATHERED UP THE CANDLE AND THE CANDLESTICK
AND AGAIN HE CAUGHT ME IN HIS ARMS AND SMOTHERED ME WITH KISSES
BE SULLEN SOBER OR GLORIOUS DRUNK
NOT WITH THE HOPE OF ESCAPE--HE HAS TAKEN CARE TO LEAVE ME NO VISIBLE CHANCE OF THAT--BUT WITH A DETERMINATION TO MAKE THE BEST OF EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES
BUT HE PREVENTED ME AND EXCLAIMING NO--BY GEORGE I'LL KEEP IT PLACED IT AGAINST HIS WAISTCOAT AND BUTTONED HIS COAT UPON IT WITH A DELIGHTED CHUCKLE
SHE PLAYS BADLY SAID HE I WANT TO MATCH MY SKILL WITH YOURS
BUT NOW EACH SEPARATE OBJECT SEEMED TO ECHO BACK MY OWN EXHILARATING SENSE OF HOPE AND FREEDOM
I SHOULD NOT DREAM OF WISHING YOUR AUNT TO LEAVE THE PLACE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
I WAS TOO LATE FOR TEA
I DARE NOT DO IT NOW YOU'RE VERY KIND MISS ELIZA
I COULD TELL THAT AS WELL BY THOSE FEW WORDS AS BY THE RECOLLECTION OF HER WHOLE ASPECT AND DEMEANOUR TOWARDS ME IN THE COMMENCEMENT OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE
IT SERVED HIM RIGHT--IT WOULD TEACH HIM BETTER MANNERS IN FUTURE
IT IS A TROUBLESOME THING HALFORD THIS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO AFFRONTS WHERE NONE ARE INTENDED
WHY YES IN A MANNER
YOU DID NOT UNDERSTAND MY GIFT SAID SHE--'OR WHAT IS WORSE YOU DESPISED IT
GILBERT LIKES A CHEERFUL FIRE IN THE KITCHEN--"MAKE THAT PIE A LARGE ONE ROSE
FOR IF HE WERE UNFIT TO ANSWER THE SUMMONS NOW AFTER A WARNING SICKNESS AND WITH SUCH AN ANGEL BY HIS SIDE IT SEEMED BUT TOO CERTAIN THAT HE NEVER WOULD BE--THAT ON THE CONTRARY RETURNING HEALTH WOULD BRING RETURNING LUST AND VILLAINY AND AS HE GREW MORE CERTAIN OF RECOVERY MORE ACCUSTOMED TO HER GENEROUS GOODNESS HIS FEELINGS WOULD BECOME MORE CALLOUS HIS HEART MORE FLINTY AND IMPERVIOUS TO HER PERSUASIVE ARGUMENTS--BUT GOD KNEW BEST
NEVER TILL NOW HAD I KNOWN THE FULL FERVOUR OF MY LOVE--THE FULL STRENGTH OF MY HOPES NOT WHOLLY CRUSHED EVEN IN MY HOURS OF DEEPEST DESPONDENCY ALWAYS TENACIOUSLY CLINGING TO THE THOUGHT THAT ONE DAY SHE MIGHT BE MINE OR IF NOT THAT AT LEAST THAT SOMETHING OF MY MEMORY SOME SLIGHT REMEMBRANCE OF OUR FRIENDSHIP AND OUR LOVE WOULD BE FOR EVER CHERISHED IN HER HEART
I WISH SOMEBODY THAT WAS WORTHY TO POSSESS HER WOULD COME AND TAKE HER AWAY--DON'T YOU FREDERICK
I DARESAY THE BOYS'LL BE HUNGRY
WILL YOU SWEAR IT
THEN SUDDENLY TURNING FROM ME SHE PACED TWICE OR THRICE THROUGH THE ROOM
BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN:--IF YOU WILL ONLY OBLIGE ME BY TAKING IT BELIEVE ME I SHALL BUILD NO HOPES UPON IT AND CONSIDER THIS NO PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE FAVOURS:--AND IT IS NONSENSE TO TALK ABOUT PUTTING YOURSELF UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO ME WHEN YOU MUST KNOW THAT IN SUCH A CASE THE OBLIGATION IS ENTIRELY ON MY SIDE,--THE FAVOUR ON YOURS WELL THEN I'LL TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD SHE ANSWERED WITH A MOST ANGELIC SMILE RETURNING THE ODIOUS MONEY TO HER PURSE--'BUT REMEMBER I WILL REMEMBER--WHAT I HAVE SAID;--BUT DO NOT YOU PUNISH MY PRESUMPTION BY WITHDRAWING YOUR FRIENDSHIP ENTIRELY FROM ME,--OR EXPECT ME TO ATONE FOR IT BY BEING MORE DISTANT THAN BEFORE SAID I EXTENDING MY HAND TO TAKE LEAVE FOR I WAS TOO MUCH EXCITED TO REMAIN
BUT POOR LITTLE ARTHUR WAS CUTTING HIS TEETH AND HIS FATHER COULD NOT BEAR HIS COMPLAINTS
I HEARD THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR OPEN
THERE WAS NO LIGHT THERE BUT THE FAINT RED GLOW OF THE NEGLECTED FIRE;--BUT I DID NOT WANT A LIGHT
AS I DO WHEN I GET SHUT OF YOU AND ALL THESE ROLLICKING DEVILS YOU CALL YOUR FRIENDS
SHE ALONE WAS LEFT HEIR TO ALL THE MEMORIES AND TRAGEDIES OF THE HOUSE
TELL ME SAID SHE AVAILING HERSELF OF THE FIRST PAUSE IN THE ATTEMPTED CONVERSATION BETWEEN HER AUNT AND ME AND SPEAKING FAST AND LOW WITH HER EYES BENT ON THE GOLD CHAIN--FOR I NOW VENTURED ANOTHER GLANCE--'TELL ME HOW YOU ALL ARE AT LINDEN-HOPE--HAS NOTHING HAPPENED SINCE I LEFT YOU I BELIEVE NOT NOBODY DEAD
ONCE DURING THE SERMON AFTER ATTENTIVELY REGARDING MR LEIGHTON FOR A FEW MINUTES HE SUDDENLY PRODUCED HIS GOLD PENCIL-CASE AND SNATCHED UP A BIBLE
IT IS THOSE BISHOPS THAT TROUBLE ME SAID HE
WHY DID YOU RUN AWAY FROM US GOOD-NIGHT MR HUNTINGDON SAID I COLDLY NOT CHOOSING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION
IT IS A SUBJECT THAT DEMANDS MATURE AND SERIOUS DELIBERATION
ASK ME SOME OTHER TIME WHEN YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN RETURNED HE AND HE MADE AN EFFORT TO PASS ME AGAIN
THE ROOM WAS SPACIOUS AND HANDSOMELY FURNISHED--VERY COMFORTABLY TOO FOR A BACHELOR
THIS MAY HAVE BEEN THE CRISIS
BUT OF COURSE THEIR POSITION WAS IMMEDIATELY CHANGED ON OUR ENTRANCE
I WISHED TO TELL THE TRUTH FOR TRUTH ALWAYS CONVEYS ITS OWN MORAL TO THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE IT
EVEN GRIMSBY COULD CHUCKLE OVER HIS ODD SAYINGS
AND THEN I'LL COME AND TELL YOU ALL ABOUT THEM WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A SMALL PARTY ON MONDAY THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER SAID MY MOTHER
YOU DON'T OBJECT TO IT HE SAID
NOVEMBER 3RD.--I HAVE MADE SOME FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE WITH MY NEIGHBOURS
HATTERSLEY'S ROUGH ATTEMPTS AT CONSOLATION WERE UTTERLY IN VAIN
HE OPENLY DECLARES HIMSELF WEARY OF YOU AND CALMLY GIVES YOU UP TO ANYBODY THAT WILL TAKE YOU
I DON'T KNOW REPLIED SHE
SO IT IS PERHAPS THE BEST FRIEND I COULD HAVE FOR THE PURPOSE
OH THIS SWEET REVENGE CRIED HE WHEN I HAD BEEN DOING ALL I COULD TO MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE AND TO REMEDY THE CARELESSNESS OF HIS NURSE
YET SHE WAS GRATIFIED AT HER SON'S GOOD FORTUNE AFTER ALL AND PROUDLY ATTRIBUTED IT ALL TO HIS OWN SUPERIOR MERITS AND ENDOWMENTS
NOT MERELY ON ACCOUNT OF MY ANTIPATHY TO THE ONCE SO BEWITCHING ELIZA BUT BECAUSE I HAD NOT HALF FORGIVEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN HIMSELF FOR HIS ILL OPINION OF MRS HUNTINGDON
HE AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ON GOOD TERMS OF LATE OH MY DEAR BOY
I WENT TO HIM AND PUT MY HAND ON HIS FOREHEAD
TRULY I DEMANDED
AND I SHALL NOT UPBRAID YOU NOW OH
BUT THAT POWER WAS PROVOKINGLY SMALL AT THE MOMENT FOR I WAS TOO MUCH FLURRIED WITH INDIGNATION--AND EVEN SHAME--THAT HE SHOULD THUS DARE TO ADDRESS ME TO RETAIN SUFFICIENT COMMAND OF THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE TO ENABLE ME ADEQUATELY TO CONTEND AGAINST HIS POWERFUL SOPHISTRIES
TO OBVIATE THAT HE AT LENGTH CONSENTED TO HAVE ONE WING OF THE OLD HALL PUT INTO A HABITABLE CONDITION AS A PLACE OF REFUGE AGAINST A TIME OF NEED
HE NEVER READS ANYTHING BUT NEWSPAPERS AND SPORTING MAGAZINES
NOW ARE YOU SATISFIED SHE LOOKED UP IN MY FACE WITH A SMILE OF INEFFABLE TENDERNESS
A FORTUNE OF HER OWN BESIDES AND ONLY ONE CHILD AND SHE'S NURSING A FINE ESTATE FOR HIM IN THERE'LL BE LOTS TO SPEAK FOR HER
BUT SUCH INTERCOURSE SERVES TO GET THE TIME ON AND I AM VERY WILLING IT SHOULD CONTINUE AS IT SAVES ME SOME HOURS OF DISCOMFORT IN ARTHUR'S SOCIETY AND GIVES HIM SOME BETTER EMPLOYMENT THAN THE SOTTISH INDULGENCE OF HIS SENSUAL APPETITES
AND THE SATISFACTION OF MY OWN CONSCIENCE IT SEEMS IS THE ONLY REWARD I NEED LOOK FOR HE LOOKED RATHER SURPRISED AT THE EARNESTNESS OF MY MANNER
SHALL I FIND ROSE AT HOME DO YOU THINK SAID SHE AS WE CLOSED THE GARDEN GATE AND SET OUR FACES TOWARDS LINDEN-CAR
BUT HE NEVER CONFESSED IT TO ME OR HINTED ONE WORD OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR THE PART I HAD HAD IN HIS DELIVERANCE BUT THIS WAS NOT SURPRISING TO ANY ONE THAT KNEW HIM AS I DID
NOT THIS WEEK I REPLIED
WILL YOU ORDER ONE IF I RING WHY GILBERT YOU DON'T LOOK COLD SAID SHE SMILINGLY REGARDING MY FACE WHICH NO DOUBT SEEMED WARM ENOUGH
I THOUGHT NOT
I HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO MAKE HIM SWALLOW A LITTLE WINE OR WEAK SPIRITS-AND-WATER BY WAY OF MEDICINE WHEN HE WAS SICK AND IN FACT I HAVE DONE WHAT I COULD TO MAKE HIM HATE THEM EVERYBODY LAUGHED EXCEPT THE YOUNG WIDOW AND HER SON
TELL ME WHAT IT IS THAT I MAY BE YOUR MEDIATOR AND MAKE YOU FRIENDS AGAIN I HAVE DONE NOTHING WILLINGLY TO OFFEND HIM SAID I
I THOUGHT HIS GOOD-FELLOWSHIP WOULDN'T LAST LONG
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HER SENSE OF DUTY THAT HAD KEPT HER SILENT
AND IF A COLD ENSUED THE SEVERER THE BETTER--IT WOULD HELP TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SULLEN MOODS AND MOPING MELANCHOLY LIKELY TO CLOUD MY BROW FOR LONG ENOUGH
AND SHE IS RIGHT TO WISH ME NOT TO REMEMBER HER TOO WELL
COME I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU A BIT SPEAK THEN BUT I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD BE QUITE AGREEABLE TO THE LADY WHAT I HAVE TO SAY THEN IT WOULD NOT BE AGREEABLE TO ME SAID HIS LORDSHIP TURNING TO LEAVE THE ROOM
WILL YOU GO ON TILL I HATE YOU AND THEN ACCUSE ME OF BREAKING MY VOWS HE WAS SILENT A MOMENT AND THEN REPLIED
MR
THE PROBABILITY IS THAT WHEN SHE LEFT THORPE GREEN IN 1845 SHE WAS ALREADY SUFFERING FROM THAT RELIGIOUS MELANCHOLY OF WHICH CHARLOTTE DISCOVERED SUCH PITEOUS EVIDENCE AMONG HER PAPERS AFTER DEATH
I WISH IT WERE SUCH A ONE AS I COULD SHOW TO HIS LADY HE HALF DREW FROM HIS WAISTCOAT-POCKET A LETTER WITH ARTHUR'S STILL BELOVED HAND ON THE ADDRESS SCOWLED AT IT AND PUT IT BACK AGAIN ADDING--'BUT HE TELLS ME HE IS ABOUT TO RETURN NEXT WEEK HE TELLS ME SO EVERY TIME HE WRITES INDEED
BUT I HAD NOT DONE WITH HER IMPUDENCE YET
BUT ARTHUR'S TINY SOMEWHAT SNUBBY NOSE COULD NEVER BECOME SO LONG AND STRAIGHT AS MR LAWRENCE'S
IN A SOFTER TONE SHE REPEATED HER RECOMMENDATION TO RETIRE AND GENTLY KISSING MY FOREHEAD BADE ME GOOD-NIGHT AND PUT HER CANDLE IN MY HAND
IT SEEMED SO HEAVY A CHARGE
I UPBRAIDED HIM IN BITTERNESS AND SCORN FOR HIS MEAN AND DISHONOURABLE CONDUCT BUT THAT HAD NO EFFECT UPON HIM
NEXT TIME MRS HARGRAVE CALLS I SHALL HAIL HER ADVENT AS QUITE A RELIEF
AND THEN HE STEPPED LAUGHINGLY FORWARD AND SAID COME I'LL PRESERVE YOU FROM THAT INFLICTION WHO WAS IT I ASK SAID SHE WITH FRIGID GRAVITY
BUT MY COMPANION A LOQUACIOUS FORWARD FELLOW WAS NOT DISPOSED TO LEAVE ME TO THE INDULGENCE OF MY PRIVATE COGITATIONS
AVOIDING THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE TOWN HE CONTINUED TO PASS HIS LIFE IN THE COUNTRY IMMERSED IN THE USUAL PURSUITS OF A HEARTY ACTIVE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN
CHAPTER XLIII OCTOBER 10TH.--MR HUNTINGDON RETURNED ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO
THE FIRST TIME THE LATTER AND I WERE ALONE TOGETHER AFTER THAT UNHAPPY EVENING WAS AN HOUR OR TWO AFTER BREAKFAST ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN THE GENTLEMEN WERE GONE OUT AFTER THE USUAL TIME SPENT IN THE WRITING OF LETTERS THE READING OF NEWSPAPERS AND DESULTORY CONVERSATION
I CAN'T AND WON'T HE ADDED VEHEMENTLY AS IF SUDDENLY STRUCK WITH THE APPALLING ASPECT OF THAT TERRIBLE EVENT
IT IS VERY TRUE THAT THE THREE ELDER GENTLEMEN HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES MUCH KEENER SPORTSMEN THAN THE TWO YOUNGER ONES
BUT AGAIN OUR FRIEND SOLOMON SAYS THERE IS NOTHING BETTER FOR A MAN THAN TO EAT AND TO DRINK AND TO BE MERRY AND AGAIN RETURNED I HE SAYS REJOICE O YOUNG MAN IN THY YOUTH
HIS I THINK WERE BUSINESS LETTERS AND APPARENTLY NOT MUCH TO HIS MIND FOR HE CRUSHED THEM INTO HIS POCKET WITH SOME MUTTERED EXPLETIVES THAT I SHOULD HAVE REPROVED HIM FOR AT ANY OTHER TIME
BUT TELL ME ARTHUR WHAT IS THIS TIRESOME BUSINESS
WHY ESTHER YOU'RE CRYING NOW OH IT'S NOTHING--IT'S ONLY TOO MUCH HAPPINESS--AND THE WISH SOBBED SHE THAT OUR DEAR HELEN WERE AS HAPPY AS OURSELVES BLESS YOU FOR THAT WISH I INWARDLY RESPONDED AS THE CARRIAGE ROLLED AWAY--'AND HEAVEN GRANT IT BE NOT WHOLLY VAIN I THOUGHT A CLOUD HAD SUDDENLY DARKENED HER HUSBAND'S FACE AS SHE SPOKE
I SEE NO FUN IN WASTING IT ON THIEVES AND BLACKLEGS
WHAT THE DEVIL IS THIS HE MUTTERED
I HOPE GOD WILL PROSPER YOUR UNION AND MAKE MY DEAR GIRL HAPPY AT LAST
WELL RESUMED SHE HAVE YOU NOT OBSERVED THE SALUTARY CHANGE IN MR HUNTINGDON
FOR SHE COLOURED AND HESITATED
I SHOULD NOT DESIRE HER TO REGRET ME TOO DEEPLY
BUT CONTRARY TO MY EXPECTATION ON THE THIRD MORNING WHILE I WAS THUS EMPLOYED MR HARGRAVE DID LOOK IN AND DID NOT IMMEDIATELY WITHDRAW ON SEEING ME
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE PROJECTED A VISIT OF SIX MONTHS AT LEAST
BUT WHERE SHOULD I FIND AN ASYLUM AND HOW OBTAIN SUBSISTENCE FOR US BOTH
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE IF MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT
BUT MILICENT BEGGED ME NOT TO YIELD AND I'M SURE MRS HUNTINGDON IF YOU HAD SEEN THE MAN THEY WANTED TO PALM UPON ME YOU WOULD HAVE ADVISED ME NOT TO TAKE HIM TOO I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO WHETHER I HAD SEEN HIM OR NOT SAID I
ONLY TRUST AND PARDON ME THIS ONCE AND YOU SHALL SEE
IT WAS EARLY IN MARCH THAT HE WENT AND HE DID NOT RETURN TILL JULY
AND THEN I GO ON TILL SHE CRIES AND THAT SATISFIES ME THEN YOU DO DELIGHT TO OPPRESS HER I DON'T I TELL YOU
AND AFTER A WHILE SHE BECAME MORE FRIENDLY AND AT LENGTH I SUCCEEDED IN SECURING HER ATTENTION ALMOST ENTIRELY TO MYSELF--AND THEN I WAS HAPPY INDEED
WITH EXECRATIONS NOT LOUD BUT DEEP I LEFT HIM TO LIVE OR DIE AS HE COULD WELL SATISFIED THAT I HAD DONE MY DUTY IN ATTEMPTING TO SAVE HIM--BUT FORGETTING HOW I HAD ERRED IN BRINGING HIM INTO SUCH A CONDITION AND HOW INSULTINGLY MY AFTER-SERVICES HAD BEEN OFFERED--AND SULLENLY PREPARED TO MEET THE CONSEQUENCES IF HE SHOULD CHOOSE TO SAY I HAD ATTEMPTED TO MURDER HIM--WHICH I THOUGHT NOT UNLIKELY AS IT SEEMED PROBABLE HE WAS ACTUATED BY SUCH SPITEFUL MOTIVES IN SO PERSEVERINGLY REFUSING MY ASSISTANCE
I CAN WRITE NO MORE
SO COME ALONG THERE WAS SOMETHING IMPLIED HERE THAT I COULD NOT ENDURE
HE OFTEN CALLS UPON US HERE AND ARTHUR NOT UNFREQUENTLY RIDES OVER TO HIM
AND AT LENGTH I JUDGED IT PRUDENT TO OBEY AND SHE RE-ENTERED THE HOUSE AND I WENT DOWN THE HILL
AT THE FIRST SLIGHT SOB HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ROUND IMPATIENTLY EXCLAIMING WHAT ARE YOU CRYING FOR HELEN
THAT WAS THE CRISIS HELEN SAID HE DELIGHTEDLY
SHE LOOKED CONFOUNDED--ALMOST FRIGHTENED AGAIN FOR A MOMENT
VERY RIGHT SAID HE PROVIDED YOUR CONSCIENCE BE NOT TOO MORBIDLY TENDER AND YOUR IDEAS OF GOD NOT TOO ERRONEOUSLY SEVERE
MR HARGRAVE ASKED IF I FELT COLD AND SHUT THE DOOR--A VERY UNSEASONABLE PIECE OF OFFICIOUSNESS FOR I HAD MEDITATED FOLLOWING THE NOISY PLAYFELLOWS IF THEY DID NOT SPEEDILY RETURN
MRS GRAHAM WAS STUDYING THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS OF THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF TREES IN THEIR WINTER NAKEDNESS AND COPYING WITH A SPIRITED THOUGH DELICATE TOUCH THEIR VARIOUS RAMIFICATIONS
HOW CAN SHE EXPECT ME TO MEND MY WAYS AT THAT RATE PERHAPS SHE GIVES YOU CREDIT FOR HAVING MORE SENSE THAN YOU POSSESS AND DELUDES HERSELF WITH THE HOPE THAT YOU WILL ONE DAY SEE YOUR OWN ERRORS AND REPAIR THEM IF LEFT TO YOUR OWN REFLECTION NONE OF YOUR SNEERS MRS HUNTINGDON
AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MRS GREAVES MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS
AND YET HOW ANXIOUSLY I LOOK FORWARD TO THEM
BUT I DETERMINED NOT TO BE SUCH A FOOL AS TO COME AWAY WITHOUT HAVING MADE THE ATTEMPT
I TOOK UP MY BABY AND WISHING HIM GOOD-MORNING DEPARTED TO INDULGE MY THOUGHTS UNSCRUTINIZED WITHIN THE SANCTUM OF MY HOME
THE GONDAL CHRONICLES SEEM TO HAVE AMUSED THEM FOR MANY YEARS AND TO HAVE BRANCHED OUT INTO INNUMERABLE BOOKS WRITTEN IN THE TINY WRITING OF WHICH MR CLEMENT SHORTER HAS GIVEN US FACSIMILES
AND WHEN HIS FIRST SCRUPLES OF CONSCIENCE WERE OVERCOME HE WOULD NEED NO MORE PERSUADING HE WOULD OFTEN GROW DESPERATE AND BE AS GREAT A BLACKGUARD AS ANY OF THEM COULD DESIRE--BUT ONLY TO LAMENT HIS OWN UNUTTERABLE WICKEDNESS AND DEGRADATION THE MORE WHEN THE FIT WAS OVER
HIS HEART WAS LIKE A SENSITIVE PLANT THAT OPENS FOR A MOMENT IN THE SUNSHINE BUT CURLS UP AND SHRINKS INTO ITSELF AT THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF THE FINGER OR THE LIGHTEST BREATH OF WIND
AND FLAT CONTRADICTIONS WERE BUT AS OIL TO THE FLAMES CALLING FORTH NEW STRAINS OF ARGUMENT TO SUPPORT HIS DOGMAS AND BRINGING DOWN UPON ME ENDLESS FLOODS OF REASONING TO OVERWHELM ME WITH CONVICTION
AND THERE WAS AND IS A CONSIDERABLE NARRATIVE ABILITY A SHEER MORAL ENERGY IN WILDFELL HALL WHICH WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH INDEED TO KEEP IT ALIVE IF IT WERE NOT THE WORK OF A BRONTE BUT STILL BETRAY ITS KINSHIP AND SOURCE
SO THAT ALTOGETHER WE MADE A VERY MERRY INNOCENT AND ENTERTAINING PARTY
AND AT MORNING WHEN ROUSED BY THE FLUTTER AND CHIRP OF THE SPARROWS AND THE GLEEFUL TWITTER OF THE SWALLOWS--ALL INTENT UPON FEEDING THEIR YOUNG AND FULL OF LIFE AND JOY IN THEIR OWN LITTLE FRAMES--I OPEN THE WINDOW TO INHALE THE BALMY SOUL-REVIVING AIR AND LOOK OUT UPON THE LOVELY LANDSCAPE LAUGHING IN DEW AND SUNSHINE--I TOO OFTEN SHAME THAT GLORIOUS SCENE WITH TEARS OF THANKLESS MISERY BECAUSE HE CANNOT FEEL ITS FRESHENING INFLUENCE
AND THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF HER DELAY IN WRITING TO HER BROTHER
I WISH HE WOULD ALWAYS DO SO AND I WISH HIS FRIENDS WERE NUMEROUS AND LOVING ENOUGH TO KEEP HIM AMONGST THEM ALL THE YEAR ROUND
FOR MY CHILD'S OWN SAKE IF NOT FOR MINE HE WILL NOT SUFFER HIM TO BE TORN AWAY
ALL I CARED ABOUT BESIDES THAT ONE GRAND SUBJECT OF MY THOUGHTS WAS TO SEE THE CUPS TRAVEL UP TO THE TEA-TRAY AND NOT COME DOWN AGAIN
FOR WHO COULD TELL HOW LONG I MIGHT HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OR NEGLECT OF OTHERS OR MY OWN INEXPERIENCE OR INABILITY TO SUIT THEIR TASTES
HALLO HUNTINGDON HE SHOUTED--'I'VE GOT HIM
WELL MR HUNTINGDON I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SEE SO AMAZINGLY DIVERTING IN THE MATTER
AND WHEN I FEEL IT MY DUTY TO SPEAK AN UNPALATABLE TRUTH WITH THE HELP OF GOD I WILL SPEAK IT THOUGH IT BE TO THE PREJUDICE OF MY NAME AND TO THE DETRIMENT OF MY READER'S IMMEDIATE PLEASURE AS WELL AS MY OWN
AND STEPPING INTO THE ROOM HE TOOK HIS PRECIOUS FRIEND BY THE ARM AND ATTEMPTED TO DRAG HIM AWAY
THE CHILD LOOKED AT HER IN GRAVE SURPRISE
MY HEART SMOTE ME
HER LITTLE ARTS TO EFFECT HIS SUBJUGATION WERE TOO SUBTLE AND IMPALPABLE TO ATTRACT MY OBSERVATION
AND BESIDES I KNOW I SHOULD DERIVE GREAT COMFORT AND BENEFIT FROM AN OCCASIONAL ATTENDANCE AT PUBLIC WORSHIP IF I COULD ONLY HAVE FAITH AND FORTITUDE TO COMPOSE MY THOUGHTS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE SOLEMN OCCASION AND FORBID THEM TO BE FOR EVER DWELLING ON MY ABSENT CHILD AND ON THE DREADFUL POSSIBILITY OF FINDING HIM GONE WHEN I RETURN
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT HE WAXED MORE FULSOMELY TENDER AND MORE REPULSIVELY WARM AND I WAS DRIVEN TO THE VERY VERGE OF DESPERATION AND ABOUT TO SAY I KNOW NOT WHAT WHEN I FELT MY HAND THAT HUNG OVER THE ARM OF THE SOFA SUDDENLY TAKEN BY ANOTHER AND GENTLY BUT FERVENTLY PRESSED
THEN HE HASN'T TOLD YOU ABOUT HIS SISTER WHAT OF HER I DEMANDED IN TERROR LEST SOME EVIL SHOULD HAVE BEFALLEN HER
SOMETIMES HE TRIES TO JOKE AND LAUGH WITH HIM BUT THAT WILL NOT DO
I HAD WOUNDED HIM TO THE QUICK
I SHOULD NOT WISH TO GUIDE HIM
I HAD SOLICITED THE FAVOUR MYSELF
AND YET IT MADE ME SMILE
LITTLE HELEN HOWEVER WAS SOON TIRED OF PLAYING AND INSISTED UPON GOING TO SLEEP
ANOTHER TIME PERHAPS SPEAK OUT MISS ELIZA SAID I NOT DEIGNING TO NOTICE THE OTHER'S BUFFOONERIES
THE PARTICULARS ARE AS FOLLOWS
BUT HENCEFORTH WE ARE HUSBAND AND WIFE ONLY IN THE NAME VERY GOOD I AM YOUR CHILD'S MOTHER AND YOUR HOUSEKEEPER NOTHING MORE
AND INDEED I WAS GENERALLY MORE HUMANISED IN MY DEMEANOUR TO HER THAN TO ANY ONE ELSE MR LAWRENCE EXCEPTED
UPRIGHT HONOURABLE SENSIBLE SOBER RESPECTABLE
HE WAS PLEASED WITH THIS MARK OF CONFIDENCE AND CERTAINLY DID NOT BETRAY IT
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT MRS HUNTINGDON ASKED MR HARGRAVE AFTER A SHORT PAUSE DURING WHICH I HAD FELT HE WAS KEENLY EXAMINING MY HALF-AVERTED FACE
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WITH A MOMENTARY PANG--A FLASH OF WILD DISMAY I ASK MYSELF HELEN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE BUT I REBUKE THE INWARD QUESTIONER AND REPEL THE OBTRUSIVE THOUGHTS THAT CROWD UPON ME
FOR BY MY OWN DESIRE NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THE INCOME OF MY FORTUNE IS DEVOTED FOR YEARS TO COME TO THE PAYING OFF OF HIS DEBTS AND THE MONEY HE CONTRIVES TO SQUANDER AWAY IN LONDON IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE
SO GREAT WAS HIS CONFIDENCE EITHER IN HIS WEALTH OR HIS REMAINING POWERS OF ATTRACTION AND SO FIRM HIS CONVICTION OF FEMININE WEAKNESS THAT HE THOUGHT HIMSELF WARRANTED TO RETURN TO THE SIEGE WHICH HE DID WITH RENOVATED ARDOUR ENKINDLED BY THE QUANTITY OF WINE HE HAD DRUNK--A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT RENDERED HIM INFINITELY THE MORE DISGUSTING
AND SEIZING MY HAND IN BOTH HIS HE SHOOK IT HEARTILY
BUT HE ONLY TIGHTENED HIS GRASP
SOMETIMES KNOCKING UP THE LAZY PEOPLE FROM THEIR BEDS FOR WHERE SO LITTLE WORK WAS TO BE DONE PERHAPS SO LITTLE FOOD AND FIRE TO BE HAD THEY CARED NOT TO CURTAIL THEIR SLUMBERS
BUT IT'S NO MATTER I ANSWERED CARELESSLY
NOT THESE THREE WEEKS I MIGHT HAVE SAID
HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF AT FIRST WITH HIS USUAL COLD DISTANT HALF-STATELY HALF-MELANCHOLY ALTOGETHER INJURED AIR
AND THEN HE WILL BE JUST AS HAPPY IN THE ILLUSION AS IF IT WERE REALITY
WAS IT TRUE THEN
I WOULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE CHANCE IF I WERE YOU
FOR ASSURED OF THE FALSEHOOD OF THIS I TRUSTED THE REST OF THE STORY WAS EQUALLY EXAGGERATED
SHOULD I HELP HIM TO HIS HORSE
FOR UPWARDS OF THREE YEARS I HAVE ENDURED A PERFECT MARTYRDOM
BUT I AM THE LAST PERSON YOU SHOULD APPLY TO FOR INFORMATION RESPECTING MRS GRAHAM HE THEN IMMEDIATELY TURNED TO ROSE AND ASKED HER TO FAVOUR THE COMPANY WITH A SONG OR A TUNE ON THE PIANO
A MAN MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO GRUMBLE ABOUT
COME IN SAID SHE FOR I HAD MET THEM IN THE GARDEN IT IS FINISHED AND FRAMED ALL READY FOR SENDING AWAY
SHE WAS COOL IN TEMPER CIVIL IN DEMEANOUR
AND I DON'T LIKE TO BE LAUGHED AT RETURNED I MAKING VIOLENT EFFORTS TO SPEAK WITH PROPER DIGNITY AND COMPOSURE AND TO SAY NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS COHERENT AND SENSIBLE
ROSE HOWEVER VOWED SHE DID NOT AND WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT AND MY MOTHER MADE THE SAME DECLARATION THOUGH NOT I FEAR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF REAL UNWAVERING INCREDULITY
AT LENGTH HOWEVER I ENTERED THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF GRASSDALE
AND FINDING ME INEXORABLE HE AT LENGTH MANAGED TO RATIFY THE AGREEMENT
BAD NEWS FLIES FAST
FOR THE LATTER TASK MUST BE DONE WITH THE UTMOST CAUTION AND SECRECY AND THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME TO ASSIST HER
IT MAY BE SO HE REPLIED CARELESSLY AS HE SEIZED A TUMBLER OF WINE AND WATER ADDING WHEN HE HAD TOSSED IT OFF FOR I HAVE AN INFERNAL FIRE IN MY VEINS THAT ALL THE WATERS OF THE OCEAN CANNOT QUENCH WHAT KINDLED IT I WAS ABOUT TO ASK BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE BUTLER ENTERED AND BEGAN TO TAKE AWAY THE THINGS
FOR SHE SEEMS HAUGHTY AND DISPLEASED AND LORD LOWBOROUGH IS MANIFESTLY MORE CHEERFUL AND MORE CORDIAL TOWARDS HIS HOST THAN BEFORE
BUT LET ME ASSURE YOU I SHALL NOT BE SEVERE TO MARK THE FAULTS AND FOIBLES OF A YOUNG AND ARDENT NATURE SUCH AS YOURS AND WHILE I ACKNOWLEDGE THEM TO MYSELF AND EVEN REBUKE THEM WITH ALL A FATHER'S CARE BELIEVE ME NO YOUTHFUL LOVER COULD BE MORE TENDERLY INDULGENT TOWARDS THE OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTIONS THAN I TO YOU
BUT HAVE YOU ENOUGH REAL SYMPATHY FOR MY AFFLICTIONS TO INDUCE YOU TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO RELIEVE THEM AT THE RISK OF A LITTLE DISCOMFORT TO YOURSELF TRY ME AND SEE IF YOU HAVE NEVER MENTION THIS SUBJECT AGAIN
LET ME FIRST ESTABLISH MY POSITION AS A FRIEND THOUGHT I--'THE PATRON AND PLAYFELLOW OF HER SON THE SOBER SOLID PLAIN-DEALING FRIEND OF HERSELF AND THEN WHEN I HAVE MADE MYSELF FAIRLY NECESSARY TO HER COMFORT AND ENJOYMENT IN LIFE AS I BELIEVE I CAN WE'LL SEE WHAT NEXT MAY BE EFFECTED SO WE TALKED ABOUT PAINTING POETRY AND MUSIC THEOLOGY GEOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY
FOR I SHOULD PROBABLY COME TO CLAIM IT WITHIN A DAY AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THAT NOTE
BUT IT WAS NOT ON HER ACCOUNT OR HER COUSIN'S THAT I HAVE MENTIONED THE PARTY
THE SHROUD THE COFFIN THE DARK LONELY GRAVE AND ALL THE HORRORS OF CORRUPTION
BUT IN THE VERY ACT MY CONSCIENCE REPROVED ME KNOWING AS I DID THAT SOONER OR LATER THE TIE MUST BE BROKEN AND THIS WAS ONLY NOURISHING FALSE HOPES AND PUTTING OFF THE EVIL DAY
HE WAS INORDINATELY FOND OF THEM FOR SO YOUNG A CREATURE AND REMEMBERING MY UNFORTUNATE FATHER AS WELL AS HIS I DREADED THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A TASTE
THE LADY'S TEMPER IS NONE OF THE MILDEST NOTWITHSTANDING HER SWEET PALE FACE AND LOFTY BROW WHERE THOUGHT AND SUFFERING SEEM EQUALLY TO HAVE STAMPED THEIR IMPRESS ALL THIS TIME I WAS SEATED AT A TABLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM APPARENTLY IMMERSED IN THE PERUSAL OF A VOLUME OF THE FARMER'S MAGAZINE WHICH I HAPPENED TO HAVE BEEN READING AT THE MOMENT OF OUR VISITOR'S ARRIVAL
BUT YOU NEEDN'T MIND THAT
WHY THAT YOU HOPED SHE WOULD MAKE HIM A GOOD WIFE
YOU'RE AT THAT GAME OF THREATENING ME WITH THE LOSS OF YOUR AFFECTION AGAIN ARE YOU
ARRIVED AT WOODFORD THE YOUNG SQUIRE'S ABODE I FOUND NO LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING ADMISSION TO HIS PRESENCE
ONLY SIN NO MORE HE PRESSED MY COLD HAND WITH SENTIMENTAL FERVOUR BUT SAID NOTHING AND STOOD ASIDE TO LET ME PASS INTO THE ROOM WHERE ALL THE COMPANY WERE NOW ASSEMBLED
WELL IF YOU'LL BE VERY GOOD AND AMUSING WE SHALL NOT OBJECT LET YOUR PERMISSION BE UNCONDITIONAL PRAY
I DESIRED OUR INTIMACY TO BE DISCONTINUED AT ONCE AS YOU YOURSELF HAD ACKNOWLEDGED WOULD PROBABLY BE THE CASE IF I KNEW ALL
BUT WHO TOLD YOU I DIDN'T
EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT ABANDON HIMSELF TO THE ENJOYMENT OF THAT PURE AIR AND BALMY SUNSHINE--THAT SPLENDID PROSPECT AND THOSE SOOTHING SOUNDS THE MUSIC OF THE WAVES AND OF THE SOFT WIND IN THE SHELTERING TREES ABOVE HIM--NOT EVEN WITH A LADY BY HIS SIDE THOUGH NOT A VERY CHARMING ONE I WILL ALLOW)--HE MUST PULL OUT HIS BOOK AND MAKE THE MOST OF HIS TIME WHILE DIGESTING HIS TEMPERATE MEAL AND REPOSING HIS WEARY LIMBS UNUSED TO SO MUCH EXERCISE
BUT THEY HAD NO SUCH EFFECT UPON ME
IT WAS WELL IT DID FOR REVIEWING THE MATTER IN MY SOBER JUDGMENT I MUST SAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHLY ABSURD AND IMPROPER TO HAVE QUARRELLED WITH HIM ON SUCH AN OCCASION
IS THERE NOT SOME ONE THAT LIVES NEAR--OR FREQUENTLY VISITS THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT HAS LONG BEEN ATTACHED TO HER?--A MR.--OH DEAR
AND IF MY PRODUCTIONS CANNOT NOW BE SEEN BY ANY ONE BUT MYSELF AND THOSE WHO DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEM THEY POSSIBLY MAY BE HEREAFTER
HIM I SAW NOT
AND I WITHDREW AT LENGTH TOO PLAINLY SEEING THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE--AND SADLY GRIEVED TO FIND HER CASE SO HOPELESS
FOR THE PRESENT I COULD ONLY RESENT THE INSULT BY PRESSING MY FOOT UPON HIS TOES DEFERRING FURTHER VENGEANCE TILL WE GOT OUT OF CHURCH
HE NEXT PLEADED INABILITY TO HOLD THE PEN
I NEED NOT TELL YOU THIS WAS MY SISTER ROSE
A SUDDEN FLASH IN THE EYE AS HE DARTED A SUDDEN GLANCE AT THE CHILD AND THEN AT ME
DARE I TRUST THEM
BUT BEING TO MY PRIVATE SATISFACTION ENTIRELY CUT OFF FROM BOTH THESE SOURCES OF DIVERSION HIS SUFFERINGS WERE TRULY DEPLORABLE
THEY WILL DO ME GOOD--IF ANYTHING WILL HERE THEN WERE SHE AND RACHEL COMING TO TAKE A WALK IN THE GARDEN
JUST THEN THERE AROSE A SLIGHT COMMOTION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ME OCCASIONED BY MISS WILSON'S COMING TO NEGOTIATE AN EXCHANGE OF SEATS WITH ROSE
IT WILL SERVE FOR ANOTHER PAINTING
YOUR AUNT WOULD ANSWER NO"--BUT WHAT SAY YOU I SAY YES UNCLE REPLIED I WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION
HOW CRUEL JUST WHEN SHE WAS GOING TO MENTION ME
THOUGH NEITHER LONG NOR LOVERLIKE WERE MORE REGULAR THAN EVER THEY HAD BEEN BEFORE
I NEVER MENTIONED IT BEFORE BECAUSE I WAS ASHAMED TO DO SO
HAVE I NOT PROVEN TO YOU HOW WRONG IT IS--HOW CONTRARY TO SCRIPTURE AND TO REASON TO TEACH A CHILD TO LOOK WITH CONTEMPT AND DISGUST UPON THE BLESSINGS OF PROVIDENCE INSTEAD OF TO USE THEM ARIGHT YOU MAY CONSIDER LAUDANUM A BLESSING OF PROVIDENCE SIR REPLIED MR LAWRENCE SMILING
BUT I MUST SEE HER RACHEL SAID I PLACING MY HAND ON THE DOOR TO PREVENT ITS BEING SHUT AGAINST ME
I HAD NOT THUS LOOKED AND WISHED AND WONDERED LONG BEFORE I VAULTED OVER THE BARRIER UNABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF TAKING ONE GLANCE THROUGH THE WINDOW JUST TO SEE IF SHE WERE MORE COMPOSED THAN WHEN WE PARTED;--AND IF I FOUND HER STILL IN DEEP DISTRESS PERHAPS I MIGHT VENTURE ATTEMPT A WORD OF COMFORT--TO UTTER ONE OF THE MANY THINGS I SHOULD HAVE SAID BEFORE INSTEAD OF AGGRAVATING HER SUFFERINGS BY MY STUPID IMPETUOSITY
SURELY SURELY YOU ARE NOT SO UNFORGIVING AS TO CARRY YOUR LITTLE DIFFERENCES TO SUCH A LENGTH AS LITTLE DIFFERENCES INDEED I MUTTERED
AND THE FORMER I SUSPECT SHE INTENDS AS A SPECIES OF COUNTER-ATTRACTION TO WIN MR HUNTINGDON'S ATTENTION FROM ME
SO LET US DROP THE SUBJECT AND NEVER RECUR TO IT AGAIN
IF I ATTEMPT TO CURB HIS WILL OR LOOK GRAVELY ON HIM FOR SOME ACT OF CHILDISH DISOBEDIENCE HE KNOWS HIS OTHER PARENT WILL SMILE AND TAKE HIS PART AGAINST ME
CHAPTER XIV NEXT MORNING I BETHOUGHT ME I TOO HAD BUSINESS AT L
YOU ARE MISERABLE NOW MRS HUNTINGDON CONTINUED HE LOOKING ME BOLDLY IN THE FACE
I NOW SUBMITTED TO BE DRESSED FOR DINNER--A DUTY WHICH RACHEL HAD BEEN URGING UPON ME FOR THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES
HE POLITELY ANSWERED MY INQUIRIES AND THEN RETURNED AGAIN TO THE SUBJECT I WISHED TO AVOID
BUT STILL THE LADIES CONTINUED TO TALK ABOUT HER AND STILL OUR ACQUAINTANCE CONTINUED THOUGH SLOWLY TO ADVANCE
BESIDES I HAD NOW ANOTHER CLAIMANT ON MY TIME AND CARE--MY AILING INFANT FOR WHOSE SAKE I FREQUENTLY BRAVED AND SUFFERED THE REPROACHES AND COMPLAINTS OF HIS UNREASONABLY EXACTING FATHER
ALL VERY RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD REMAIN TO COMFORT AND HELP HIS SISTER BUT HE MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN TO TELL ME HOW SHE WAS OR AT LEAST TO TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT HIS RETURN
BUT I DID NOT DEIGN TO ANSWER HIM SAVE BY A LOOK OF SILENT SULLEN CONTEMPT AT WHICH HE TURNED AWAY AND CONTEMPLATED THE CARPET WITH A SLIGHT SMILE HALF PENSIVE HALF AMUSED
SHE DID NOT HEAR ME COMING
YOU CANNOT RECUR TO IT IN ANY WAY WITHOUT DOUBLING THE WEIGHT OF THOSE SUFFERINGS YOU SO FEELINGLY DEPLORE
JUST A NICE WALK FOR THE GENTLEMEN CONTINUED ROSE
HE HAS NEVER ONCE ATTEMPTED TO ANNOY ME SINCE BY THE MOST DISTANT ALLUSION TO LADY F OR ANY OF THOSE DISAGREEABLE REMINISCENCES OF HIS FORMER LIFE
PERHAPS WHILE HIS BACK WAS TOWARDS ME I MIGHT CROSS THE ROOM AND SLIP AWAY UNOBSERVED
SHE SWORE SHE WOULD NOT UNLESS MISS ELIZA WOULD GO TOO
AND WHEN THAT PROFLIGATE SCOUNDREL HAS RUN THROUGH HIS CAREER YOU WILL GIVE YOUR HAND TO ME--I'LL WAIT TILL THEN BUT SHE WOULD NOT LEAVE ME THIS SUPPORT
BUT IT HARDLY FITS THE TRAGIC STORY THAT MRS GASKELL BELIEVED
BUT IN THE MORNING WHEN I WOKE WITHOUT THAT CHEERING HOPE THAT HAD BEEN MY SECRET COMFORT AND SUPPORT SO LONG AND ALL THIS DAY WHEN I HAVE WANDERED ABOUT RESTLESS AND OBJECTLESS SHUNNING MY HUSBAND SHRINKING EVEN FROM MY CHILD KNOWING THAT I AM UNFIT TO BE HIS TEACHER OR COMPANION HOPING NOTHING FOR HIS FUTURE LIFE AND FERVENTLY WISHING HE HAD NEVER BEEN BORN,--I FELT THE FULL EXTENT OF MY CALAMITY AND I FEEL IT NOW
HE THEN TOOK A NUMBER OF BOOKS FROM THE TABLE BESIDE HIM AND THREW THEM ONE BY ONE AT THE OBJECT OF HIS WRATH
AND ONCE HE PAUSED IN THE MIDDLE OF A STORY OR A SERMON I DON'T KNOW WHICH AND FIXED HIS EYES UPON YOU GILBERT AS MUCH AS TO SAY WHEN MR MARKHAM HAS DONE FLIRTING WITH THOSE TWO LADIES I WILL PROCEED WHAT MORE WAS SAID AT THE TEA-TABLE I CANNOT TELL NOR HOW I FOUND PATIENCE TO SIT TILL THE MEAL WAS OVER
I'VE BEEN ASKING YOUR SWEET NIECE TO TAKE ME FOR BETTER FOR WORSE
IT WAS TRUE THEN THAT HE HAD SOME DESIGNS UPON MRS GRAHAM
COULD HE GRUDGE SUCH HAPPINESS TO HIS DEAR SISTER AND HIS FRIEND AS HE NOW FELT HIMSELF
WELL IT IS LIKE HIM
I WILL REMEMBER THE COUNSEL OF THE INSPIRED WRITER TO HIM THAT FEARETH THE LORD AND OBEYETH THE VOICE OF HIS SERVANT THAT SITTETH IN DARKNESS AND HATH NO LIGHT
HE IS NOT SICK OF ME YET
YOU SHALL NOT HAVE THE PAIN OF ANOTHER EFFORT TO DISMISS ME
I MENTIONED MY FEARS TO FREDERICK AND INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT OF MY PLAN OF RESCUE ON THE EVENING AFTER HIS ARRIVAL WHEN I PRESENTED MY LITTLE SON TO HIS UNCLE
BUT IS CONTINUALLY DREADING THE CLOSE OF SUCH SHORT-LIVED FELICITY
AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE LANE I SAW A SOLITARY EQUESTRIAN COMING UP
THIS CURSED THIRST IS BURNING MY HEART TO ASHES
YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT YOUR CONTINUANCE HERE IS EXCESSIVELY DISAGREEABLE TO ME--NOT FOR MR HUNTINGDON'S SAKE SAID I OBSERVING THE DAWN OF A MALICIOUS SMILE OF TRIUMPH ON HER FACE--'YOU ARE WELCOME TO HIM IF YOU LIKE HIM AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED--BUT BECAUSE IT IS PAINFUL TO BE ALWAYS DISGUISING MY TRUE SENTIMENTS RESPECTING YOU AND STRAINING TO KEEP UP AN APPEARANCE OF CIVILITY AND RESPECT TOWARDS ONE FOR WHOM I HAVE NOT THE MOST DISTANT SHADOW OF ESTEEM
I OFFERED NAY BEGGED TO ACCOMPANY HER HOME
THE SECOND WAS TO MILICENT
THEIR SHALLOW MINDS CAN HOLD NO GREAT IDEAS AND THEIR LIGHT HEADS ARE CARRIED AWAY BY TRIVIALITIES THAT WOULD NOT MOVE A BETTER-FURNISHED SKULL
WHILE IN EMILY'S LAST LINES THE DARING SPIRIT OF THE SISTER TO WHOM THE MAGIC GIFT WAS GRANTED SEPARATES ITSELF FOR EVER FROM THE GENTLE AND ACCUSTOMED PIETY OF THE SISTER TO WHOM IT WAS DENIED
NOW TOO I COULD BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN HATTERSLEY AND GRIMSBY
MY AUNT MUST NOT KNOW OF IT YET SAID SHE
BUT THAT LOOK THAT HEIGHTENED COLOUR THAT SUDDEN SPARKLE OF THE EYE MADE MY BLOOD RISE IN WRATH
AND WHEN I GOT HOME THE MOST IMPORTANT PASSAGES WERE ENTERED IN MY DIARY AMONG THE REMARKABLE EVENTS OF THE DAY
AND MY SEEING ABOUT IT WAS TO SEND FERGUS NEXT MORNING WITH MY MOTHER'S COMPLIMENTS TO MAKE THE REQUISITE INQUIRIES
IT WAS BETTER TO BE SO OCCUPIED THAN TO BE LYING IN BED TORTURING MY BRAIN WITH RECOLLECTIONS OF THE FAR PAST AND ANTICIPATIONS OF THE DREADFUL FUTURE
AND VERY HIGHLY AS SHE RESPECTED HIM AND ALL HIS SAYINGS I ONCE HEARD HER EXCLAIM I WISH TO GOODNESS HE HAD A SON HIMSELF
EVEN WALTER IS PLEASED AT THE PROSPECT AND WHEN I CONFESSED MY RELUCTANCE TO HIM HE SAID IT WAS ALL CHILDISH NONSENSE
VERY GOOD CRIED HE
BUT YOUR SILENCE NATURALLY LED ME TO CONCLUDE MYSELF FORGOTTEN DID YOU EXPECT ME TO WRITE TO YOU THEN NO HELEN--MRS HUNTINGDON SAID I BLUSHING AT THE IMPLIED IMPUTATION CERTAINLY NOT
AND COULD I BEAR THAT SHE SHOULD THINK ME CAPABLE OF SUCH A THING?--OF PRESUMING UPON THE ACQUAINTANCE--THE LOVE IF YOU WILL--ACCIDENTALLY CONTRACTED OR RATHER FORCED UPON HER AGAINST HER WILL WHEN SHE WAS AN UNKNOWN FUGITIVE TOILING FOR HER OWN SUPPORT APPARENTLY WITHOUT FORTUNE FAMILY OR CONNECTIONS
IT IS HARD THAT MY LITTLE DARLING SHOULD LOVE HIM MORE THAN ME
NO LAWRENCE WITH YOUR LEAVE WE'LL CONTINUE IT A WHILE LONGER
NO NEVER MR HARGRAVE EXCLAIMED I QUICKLY WITHDRAWING MY HAND
AND THEN SHE RAISED HER EYES TO MINE WITH A MILDLY REPROACHFUL LOOK THAT SEEMED TO SAY YOU MUST KNOW THAT AS WELL AS I THEN WHAT MUST WE DO CRIED I PASSIONATELY
WHEN LAWRENCE CAME HOWEVER HE WAS AS RESERVED AS EVER ON THE SUBJECT OF MY KEEN ANXIETY
YOU HAVE NO REASON NOW
AND SHE KNOWS THE UTMOST EXTENT OF MY POVERTY AND CARES NOTHING ABOUT IT
I MUST CONTRIVE TO BEAR WITH YOU YOU MEAN SAID I
BUT WHEN WE GOT HOME--TO MY NEW DELIGHTFUL HOME--I WAS SO HAPPY AND HE WAS SO KIND THAT I FREELY FORGAVE HIM ALL
I THEREFORE CONTINUED TO PACE THE WALK IN SILENT ANGUISH WITH MY HAND PRESSED TO MY FOREHEAD
OH MERCY
I MUST NOT BE DENIED EXCLAIMED HE VEHEMENTLY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MILICENT HARGRAVE THOUGHT OF SUCH CONDUCT BUT I FOUND HIS CONVERSATION EXTREMELY INTERESTING
BUT I CAN BE AS PATIENT AS YOU AND IN THE END I SHALL CERTAINLY WIN HE FIXED HIS EYES UPON ME WITH A GLANCE I DID NOT LIKE KEEN CRAFTY BOLD AND ALMOST IMPUDENT;--ALREADY HALF TRIUMPHANT IN HIS ANTICIPATED SUCCESS
BUT SHE--WORDS CANNOT UTTER MY ABHORRENCE
I WOULD RATHER RUN AWAY WITH THE BUTLER YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE PECULIAR I ALLOW
SHE WAS ABOUT SIX AND TWENTY RATHER TALL AND VERY SLENDER HER HAIR WAS NEITHER CHESTNUT NOR AUBURN BUT A MOST DECIDED BRIGHT LIGHT RED
IF EVER OUR DESCENDANTS SHOULD ESTABLISH THE SCHOOLS FOR WRITERS WHICH ARE EVEN NOW THREATENED OR ATTEMPTED THEY WILL HARDLY KNOW PERHAPS ANY BETTER THAN WE WHAT GENIUS IS NOR HOW IT CAN BE PRODUCED
I CAN TAKE MY RIDES AND WALKS IN THE PARK AS USUAL
SHE IS A HARD PRETENTIOUS WORLDLY-MINDED WOMAN
PERHAPS HE WAS
HE MERELY GLANCED TOWARDS ME AND CONTINUED--ADDRESSING HIS HOSTESS IT WAS A PAINFUL DUTY MRS MARKHAM--BUT I TOLD HER AND HOW DID SHE TAKE IT ASKED MY MOTHER
HALLOOING TO CARTERS AND CLODHOPPERS AND FREQUENTLY INVADING THE COTTAGES FOR THERE WERE FEW ABROAD THAT WINTER'S MORNING
HAD HE DONE SO I SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE HAD BUT FEW CONCEALMENTS FROM HIM
HIS VERY HEART THAT I TRUSTED SO IS I FEAR LESS WARM AND GENEROUS THAN I THOUGHT IT
IT IS CONSIDERABLY MORE FREQUENTED NOW LAWRENCE SEEMED TO EXPECT ME TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TO ENTRUST HIM WITH SOME SORT OF A MESSAGE TO HIS SISTER
FIRST CAME MR WILMOT AND THE LADIES
WAS SHE UNWELL
AND ELIZA SLIPPED INTO THE VACANT CHAIR
THIS WAS BETTER THAN IF I HAD ANSWERED WITH MORE WORDS AND IN THE PASSIONATE SPIRIT TO WHICH MY FIRST IMPULSE WOULD HAVE PROMPTED
I WILL CONFESS THAT I CAME HERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEEING YOU NOT WITHOUT SOME MONITORY MISGIVINGS AT MY OWN PRESUMPTION AND FEARS THAT I SHOULD BE AS LITTLE WELCOME AS EXPECTED WHEN I CAME BUT I DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS ESTATE WAS YOURS UNTIL ENLIGHTENED ON THE SUBJECT OF YOUR INHERITANCE BY THE CONVERSATION OF TWO FELLOW-PASSENGERS IN THE LAST STAGE OF MY JOURNEY
IT WAS THE FEAR THAT THIS SUDDEN CESSATION OF PAIN WAS NOT SO FAVOURABLE A SYMPTOM AS HE SUPPOSED
IF I FIND IT MY ABSOLUTE DUTY TO SUPPRESS THEM THEY SHALL TROUBLE NO ONE BUT MYSELF
CONTEMPT MAY WOUND AND COLDNESS CHILL BUT STILL IT LINGERS IN MY HEART
AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
PULL OFF YOUR COAT AND TAKE MY PLACE IN THE FIELD TILL I COME BACK TILL YOU COME BACK?--AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING PRAY
I WAS PRESENT AT THE TIME
I HAVE PUT IT ASIDE
THE WOUNDS BEING MORE THAN SKIN-DEEP ARE NOT YET HEALED AND BLEED AFRESH AT EVERY MENTION OF THE LOVED ONE'S NAME SAY RATHER INTERPOSED MISS WILSON THAT MR MARKHAM FEELS THAT NAME IS UNWORTHY TO BE MENTIONED IN THE PRESENCE OF RIGHT-MINDED FEMALES
BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE A FIRE IN THE EVENINGS IF WE CAN BEAR IT
THEY STRUCK ME AS FORMING A PLEASING CONTRAST TO ALL THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS
I SUPPOSE MY AUNT THINKS THE LATTER WILL BENEFIT ME BY HER SOCIETY AND THE SALUTARY EXAMPLE OF HER GENTLE DEPORTMENT AND LOWLY AND TRACTABLE SPIRIT
I'LL GO AND SHOOT NOW HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND VACATED THE APARTMENT BY THE WINDOW AS HE CAME AND SETTING ON HIS HAT WITH AN AIR TOOK UP HIS GUN AND WALKED AWAY WHISTLING AS HE WENT--AND LEAVING ME NOT TOO MUCH AGITATED TO FINISH MY PICTURE FOR I WAS GLAD AT THE MOMENT THAT I HAD VEXED HIM
SO DON'T DISCOMPOSE ME AGAIN NURSE
IS MR HUNTINGDON A GOOD MAN HE IS A MUCH BETTER MAN THAN YOU THINK HIM THAT IS NOTHING TO THE PURPOSE
BUT DETERMINED TO HAVE MY OWN WAY I PULLED THE BELL
I'M GLAD MY DEAR YOU HAVE SO MUCH PRUDENCE LEFT
NEXT MORNING HE WAS WEARY STILL
I THEN GAVE HER HIS ADDRESS EXHORTED HER TO WRITE FREQUENTLY REITERATED SOME OF MY FORMER ADMONITIONS REGARDING HER OWN CONCERNS AND BADE HER A FOND FAREWELL
TO OUR SURPRISE WE WERE USHERED INTO A ROOM WHERE THE FIRST OBJECT THAT MET THE EYE WAS A PAINTER'S EASEL WITH A TABLE BESIDE IT COVERED WITH ROLLS OF CANVAS BOTTLES OF OIL AND VARNISH PALETTE BRUSHES PAINTS C
BUT AS THE FORMER WAS MORE STAID AND ELDERLY AND A CRONY OF RACHEL'S BESIDES I OF COURSE DIRECTED HER TO MAKE CHOICE OF HIM AS HER ASSISTANT AND CONFIDANT ON THE OCCASION AS FAR AS NECESSITY DEMANDED I ONLY HOPE HE MAY NOT BE BROUGHT INTO TROUBLE THEREBY AND ONLY WISH I COULD REWARD HIM FOR THE PERILOUS SERVICE HE WAS SO READY TO UNDERTAKE
ONLY,'--AND HE RAISED HIS EYES TO MY FACE AND SPOKE WITH UNUSUAL SOLEMNITY,--'ONLY LET ME TELL YOU MARKHAM THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY DESIGNS IN THAT QUARTER THEY WILL CERTAINLY FAIL
IT IS NOT AS THE WRITER OF WILDFELL HALL BUT AS THE SISTER OF CHARLOTTE AND EMILY BRONTE THAT ANNE BRONTE ESCAPES OBLIVION--AS THE FRAIL LITTLE ONE UPON WHOM THE OTHER TWO LAVISHED A TENDER AND PROTECTING CARE WHO WAS A WITNESS OF EMILY'S DEATH AND HERSELF WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF HER OWN FAREWELL TO LIFE BADE CHARLOTTE TAKE COURAGE WHEN MY THOUGHTS TURN TO ANNE SAID CHARLOTTE MANY YEARS EARLIER THEY ALWAYS SEE HER AS A PATIENT PERSECUTED STRANGER,--MORE LONELY LESS GIFTED WITH THE POWER OF MAKING FRIENDS EVEN THAN I AM LATER ON HOWEVER THIS POWER OF MAKING FRIENDS SEEMS TO HAVE BELONGED TO ANNE IN GREATER MEASURE THAN TO THE OTHERS
I HAVE SOLID GROUNDS FOR MY DISLIKE
AND IF AT ONE TIME HE TRIES MY PATIENCE BY HIS UNREASONABLE EXACTIONS AND FRETFUL COMPLAINTS AND REPROACHES AT ANOTHER HE DEPRESSES ME BY HIS ABJECT SUBMISSION AND DEPRECATORY SELF-ABASEMENT WHEN HE FEARS HE HAS GONE TOO FAR
AND IT WAS WELL FOR ME THAT I DID HEAR IT
IF IT WERE NOT FOR MY PROMISE I WOULD TELL HER NOW BY NO MEANS
YOU PERHAPS TAKEN INTO ETERNAL BLISS AND HE CAST INTO THE LAKE THAT BURNETH WITH UNQUENCHABLE FIRE--THERE FOR EVER TO NOT FOR EVER I EXCLAIMED ONLY TILL HE HAS PAID THE UTTERMOST FARTHING FOR IF ANY MAN'S WORK ABIDE NOT THE FIRE HE SHALL SUFFER LOSS YET HIMSELF SHALL BE SAVED BUT SO AS BY FIRE AND HE THAT IS ABLE TO SUBDUE ALL THINGS TO HIMSELF WILL HAVE ALL MEN TO BE SAVED AND WILL IN THE FULNESS OF TIME GATHER TOGETHER IN ONE ALL THINGS IN CHRIST JESUS WHO TASTED DEATH FOR EVERY MAN AND IN WHOM GOD WILL RECONCILE ALL THINGS TO HIMSELF WHETHER THEY BE THINGS IN EARTH OR THINGS IN HEAVEN OH HELEN
FOR SOME TIME THE COMBAT WAS DOUBTFUL
TO LOVE HIM WHEN I CAN
AND SERVE YOU RIGHT YOU WILL SAY
HE HATES CATS I DARESAY AS CORDIALLY AS HE DOES OLD MAIDS--LIKE ALL OTHER GENTLEMEN
I SHALL MAKE HIM TAKE THE LAST PENNY I OWE HIM IF I CAN POSSIBLY EFFECT IT WITHOUT OFFENDING HIM TOO DEEPLY
OF ALL THAT SHE HAD PASSED THROUGH SINCE OUR PARTING
AT LAST HOWEVER HE CAME TO A CHECK
AS THEY APPROACHED THIS I SAW BY THE ASPECT OF JANE WILSON THAT SHE WAS DIRECTING HER COMPANION'S ATTENTION TO US
WON'T YOU COME I'M BUSY JUST NOW I REPLIED SCARCE KNOWING WHAT TO ANSWER
I MUST BEG YOU TO GO ON WITH IT
WHY WHAT HELPLESS CREATURE DO YOU TAKE ME FOR I REPLIED THAT YOU CANNOT TRUST ME TO GO A HUNDRED MILES IN OUR OWN CARRIAGE WITH OUR OWN FOOTMAN AND A MAID TO ATTEND ME
AND IS THAT ALL WHY YES I THINK SO
I INTENSELY EAGER TO DISAPPOINT HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR I CONSIDERED THIS THE TYPE OF A MORE SERIOUS CONTEST AS I IMAGINED HE DID AND I FELT AN ALMOST SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD OF BEING BEATEN
AS MY AUNT WOULD TELL ME I SHOULD IF SHE KNEW WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT
HOWEVER HE WAS NOT MUCH DISCONCERTED AT THAT
YOU ARE SATISFIED IF SHE CAN KEEP YOUR HOUSE AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR CHILD
I SEE THAT A MAN CANNOT GIVE HIMSELF UP TO DRINKING WITHOUT BEING MISERABLE ONE-HALF HIS DAYS AND MAD THE OTHER
AND I SAW TWO PEOPLE THAT HAD SEEN OTHERS THAT HAD SEEN THE MAN THAT FOUND HIM
HOW CAN YOU EXPECT ME TO GATHER BLOOM AND VIGOUR HERE PINING IN SOLITUDE AND RESTLESS ANXIETY FROM DAY TO DAY?--IT WOULD SERVE YOU RIGHT TO COME BACK AND FIND MY GOOD LOOKS ENTIRELY WASTED AWAY
CHAPTER XII IN LITTLE MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES THE JOURNEY WAS ACCOMPLISHED
IN THE AFTERNOON MISS WILMOT AND LORD LOWBOROUGH LIKEWISE EXCUSED THEMSELVES FROM ATTENDING
BUT WHAT IS THIS HE MURMURED
I LOOKED
OH HELEN
ROSE AND FERGUS USUALLY SHUNNED MY PRESENCE
BUT THE LOOK SHE GAVE HIM PLAINLY SAID DO YOU CHOOSE FOR ME NOW
MR HUNTINGDON IS VERY ILL BUT NOT DYING OR IN ANY IMMEDIATE DANGER
YOU'D BETTER TAKE YOUR COFFEE SUGGESTED I
HIS SISTER TOOK THE ROSE AND GAVE IT TO ME
HE WAS IN A BAD HUMOUR THAT NIGHT
HE TOLD ME THAT HIS SISTER HAD DERIVED CONSIDERABLE BENEFIT FROM HER STAY AT F THAT HER SON WAS QUITE WELL AND--ALAS
IT WAS SOME CONSOLATION HOWEVER TO FIND THAT IN THIS INSTANCE THE LADY HAD BEEN MORE TO BLAME THAN HE FOR HE WAS VERY YOUNG AT THE TIME AND SHE HAD DECIDEDLY MADE THE FIRST ADVANCES IF WHAT HE SAID WAS TRUE
HE IS VERY FOND OF ME ALMOST TOO FOND
SPENDING HER DAYS IN FANCY-WORK AND SCANDAL
HAD HE HEARD OF MY DISAPPOINTMENT
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT YOU HAVE A FINE VIEW OF THE SEA SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
IT WAS A LOOK LESS EXPRESSIVE OF ANGER THAN OF BITTER ANGUISH AND DESPAIR
THE PALETTE-KNIVES SNAPPED IN TWO THE OIL AND TURPENTINE SENT HISSING AND ROARING UP THE CHIMNEY
SILENT AND GRIM IT FROWNED
AND WHATEVER THAT CHANGE MAY BE WE KNOW IT MUST BE FOR THE BETTER BUT IF I AM TO BE SO CHANGED THAT I SHALL CEASE TO ADORE YOU WITH MY WHOLE HEART AND SOUL AND LOVE YOU BEYOND EVERY OTHER CREATURE I SHALL NOT BE MYSELF
SHE IS AS LITTLE WORTHY OF YOUR REGRET AS SHE WAS OF YOUR AFFECTION
HOW MUCH ALLEGIANCE DO YOU OWE TO THAT MAN HE ASKED BELOW HIS BREATH AS HE STOOD BESIDE ME AT THE WINDOW AFFECTING TO BE MAKING OBSERVATIONS ON THE WEATHER
HE IMMEDIATELY WITHDREW
AND NEVER MIND THE WAGES
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE NOT CHANGED SAID MY COMPANION
I STEPPED BACK HOWEVER
IF YOU COULDN'T AFFORD TO OCCUPY THE WHOLE HOUSE AND HAVE IT MENDED UP WHY COULDN'T YOU TAKE A NEAT LITTLE COTTAGE PERHAPS I WAS TOO PROUD MR FERGUS REPLIED SHE SMILING
FOR MY PATIENT MAKES NO SCRUPLE OF CALLING ME UP AT AN HOUR WHEN HIS WANTS OR HIS FANCIES REQUIRE MY PRESENCE
WE HAVE NOT MET FOR MANY YEARS
AND I SHALL LEAVE YOU IMMEDIATELY AND NOT COME AGAIN FOR MONTHS--PERHAPS YEARS DID YOU CALL ESTHER SAID HER BROTHER APPROACHING THE WINDOW FROM WITHOUT
BUT I MAY BE ALLOWED TO MAKE HERE A FEW OBSERVATIONS WITH WHICH I WOULD HAVE PREFACED THE FIRST EDITION HAD I FORESEEN THE NECESSITY OF SUCH PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE MISAPPREHENSIONS OF THOSE WHO WOULD READ IT WITH A PREJUDICED MIND OR BE CONTENT TO JUDGE IT BY A HASTY GLANCE
AND I WONDER WHETHER I SHALL EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
BUT THIS COULD NOT REPULSE ME AND I FLEW INTO HIS ARMS
THERE IS HAPPINESS IN STORE FOR ME YET--EVEN IN THIS LIFE--SHE LOVES ME INDEED SAID I
HE STOOD BESIDE ME BUT DID NOT VENTURE TO TOUCH ME OR TO SPEAK FOR A FEW SECONDS
WOULD YOU BELIEVE MY PROTESTATIONS AND HONOUR AND TRUST ME UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE CASES ARE DIFFERENT HE REPLIED
I MUST MAKE YOU WELCOME TO MY STUDIO SAID MRS GRAHAM
BUT YOU ARE MAKING MORE PROGRESS TOWARDS THAT SAINTLY CONDITION THAN I LIKE
AND DO YOU THINK YOU CAN INJURE AND DEGRADE YOURSELF AND I NOT FEEL IT DEGRADE MYSELF HELEN YES DEGRADE
I HATED HER FOR IT FOR IT SEEMED AS IF SHE HAD CHIEFLY CONTRIBUTED TO HIS CORRUPTION
YOUR SISTER CALLED HERE A FEW DAYS AGO WITH MRS MARKHAM IS THE RESEMBLANCE SO STRONG THEN I ASKED IN SOME SURPRISE AND NOT SO GREATLY FLATTERED AT THE IDEA AS I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
BUT SAY WHAT I WILL IT IS STILL THERE AND I CANNOT BUT TASTE IT
AND FURNISHED WITH A CHANGE OF LINEN FROM MY SMALL CARPET-BAG WELL-BRUSHED CLOTHES WELL-POLISHED BOOTS AND NEAT NEW GLOVES I MOUNTED THE LIGHTNING AND RESUMED MY JOURNEY
I'M SORRY PAPA'S WICKED SAID HE MOURNFULLY AT LENGTH FOR I DON'T WANT HIM TO GO TO HELL AND SO SAYING HE BURST INTO TEARS
AND FROM ALL THESE TOKENS TOGETHER WITH MY MOTHER'S LOOKS AND GESTURES OF MINGLED HORROR AND INCREDULITY I NOW CONCLUDED THAT OBJECT TO HAVE BEEN MRS GRAHAM
GOOD-NIGHT AND MARCHED OFF TO BED REGARDLESS OF THE WALKING TOO FAST
A SIMILAR PARALLEL LIES BETWEEN ANNE'S LINES DOMESTIC PEACE,'--A SAD AND TRUE REFLECTION OF THE TERRIBLE TIMES WITH BRANWELL IN 1846--AND EMILY'S WANDERER FROM THE FOLD
NO OLD FRIENDS FORGOTTEN OR SUPPLANTED SHE DROPPED HER VOICE SO LOW IN THE LAST SENTENCE THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE CAUGHT THE CONCLUDING WORDS BUT MYSELF AND AT THE SAME TIME TURNED HER EYES UPON ME WITH A DAWNING SMILE MOST SWEETLY MELANCHOLY AND A LOOK OF TIMID THOUGH KEEN INQUIRY THAT MADE MY CHEEKS TINGLE WITH INEXPRESSIBLE EMOTIONS
A WHISPERED GOD BLESS YOU AND GO--GO WAS ALL SHE SAID
I WANT YOU TO JOIN THE COMPANY WHEN YOU ARE FIT TO BE SEEN RETURNED SHE SEVERELY REGARDING ME
AS FOR HIM FOR THE FIRST WEEK OR TWO HE WAS PEEVISH AND LOW FRETTING I SUPPOSE OVER HIS DEAR ANNABELLA'S DEPARTURE AND PARTICULARLY ILL-TEMPERED TO ME
BUT DON'T BE AFRAID GILBERT SHE ADDED SMILING SADLY AT MY MANIFEST DISCOMPOSURE
BUT SWALLOWING DOWN ALL FIERCER ANSWERS I MERELY DEMANDED,--'WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS WHY NONE REPLIED HE WITH PROVOKING QUIETNESS
BUT SHE HAS THE GOOD SENSE AND FORTITUDE TO STRIVE AGAINST THEM IN THIS PARTICULAR
BUT TO MY YOUNG IMAGINATION THEY PRESENTED ALL OF THEM A GOBLINISH APPEARANCE THAT HARMONISED WELL WITH THE GHOSTLY LEGIONS AND DARK TRADITIONS OUR OLD NURSE HAD TOLD US RESPECTING THE HAUNTED HALL AND ITS DEPARTED OCCUPANTS
SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR OF ANY SERVICE YOU HAVE RENDERED ME SAID I DETERMINED TO BE CALM FOR I KNEW BY THE TONE OF HER VOICE SHE WANTED TO PROVOKE ME
THAT IF MY OWN BLINDNESS HAS LED ME INTO THIS PIT OF HELL I HAVE NO RIGHT TO BLAME ANOTHER FOR GIVING ME CREDIT FOR A LARGER AMOUNT OF SAGACITY THAN I POSSESSED I CONFESS I WAS WRONG CONTINUED I WITHOUT REGARDING THIS BITTER INTERRUPTION
AND NOW I MUST PUT THE SAME QUESTION TO YOU IT IS A VERY IMPERTINENT QUESTION LAUGHED I FROM A YOUNG GIRL TO A MARRIED WOMAN SO MANY YEARS HER SENIOR AND I SHALL NOT ANSWER IT PARDON ME DEAR MADAM SAID SHE LAUGHINGLY THROWING HERSELF INTO MY ARMS AND KISSING ME WITH PLAYFUL AFFECTION
AND BY THOSE WHO ARROGATED TO THEMSELVES THE NAME OF GENTLEMEN
SEATING MYSELF NEAR THE WINDOW A LITTLE BACK FROM THE CIRCLE I CALLED ARTHUR TO ME AND HE AND I AND SANCHO AMUSED OURSELVES VERY PLEASANTLY TOGETHER WHILE THE TWO YOUNG LADIES BAITED HIS MOTHER WITH SMALL TALK AND FERGUS SAT OPPOSITE WITH HIS LEGS CROSSED AND HIS HANDS IN HIS BREECHES-POCKETS LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND STARING NOW UP AT THE CEILING NOW STRAIGHT FORWARD AT HIS HOSTESS IN A MANNER THAT MADE ME STRONGLY INCLINED TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE ROOM NOW WHISTLING SOTTO VOCE TO HIMSELF A SNATCH OF A FAVOURITE AIR NOW INTERRUPTING THE CONVERSATION OR FILLING UP A PAUSE AS THE CASE MIGHT BE WITH SOME MOST IMPERTINENT QUESTION OR REMARK
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOU.--WHY DID YOU STARTLE ME SO SAID SHE SOMEWHAT TESTILY
IN SEPTEMBER QUIET GRASSDALE WAS AGAIN ALIVE WITH A PARTY OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SO CALLED CONSISTING OF THE SAME INDIVIDUALS AS THOSE INVITED THE YEAR BEFORE LAST WITH THE ADDITION OF TWO OR THREE OTHERS AMONG WHOM WERE MRS HARGRAVE AND HER YOUNGER DAUGHTER
AND DO YOU THINK I COULD STOP TO CONSIDER THE FEELINGS OF AN INSENSATE BRUTE LIKE THAT WHEN MY OWN NERVES WERE RACKED AND TORN TO PIECES BY HIS CONFOUNDED BLUNDERS I NEVER HEARD YOU COMPLAIN OF YOUR NERVES BEFORE AND WHY SHOULDN'T I HAVE NERVES AS WELL AS YOU OH I DON'T DISPUTE YOUR CLAIM TO THEIR POSSESSION BUT I NEVER COMPLAIN OF MINE NO HOW SHOULD YOU WHEN YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING TO TRY THEM THEN WHY DO YOU TRY YOURS ARTHUR DO YOU THINK I HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO STAY AT HOME AND TAKE CARE OF MYSELF LIKE A WOMAN IS IT IMPOSSIBLE THEN TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF LIKE A MAN WHEN YOU GO ABROAD
I BEG YOUR PARDON EXCLAIMED HE
IT'S TOO LATE NOW SAID HE DESPONDINGLY
I PERCEIVE
BUT THE INSTANT HE RELEASED MY HAND HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO PUT HIS ARM ROUND MY NECK AND KISS ME
I WIPED HIS EYES WITH HIS FROCK TOLD HIM HE WAS ALL RIGHT AND CALLED SANCHO TO PACIFY HIM
I DON'T PRETEND TO BE A JUDGE OF SUCH MATTERS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS PLAN OF MRS GRAHAM'S AS YOU DESCRIBE IT MRS MARKHAM EXTRAORDINARY AS IT MAY BE IS NOT WITHOUT ITS ADVANTAGES
THIS TIME HE ANNOUNCED IT HIS INTENTION TO MAKE BUT A SHORT STAY IN LONDON AND PASS OVER TO THE CONTINENT WHERE HE SHOULD PROBABLY STAY A FEW WEEKS
THE READING AND ANSWERING OF MY LETTERS AND THE DIRECTION OF HOUSEHOLD CONCERNS AFFORDED ME AMPLE EMPLOYMENT FOR THE MORNING
WHAT DID YOU DO IT FOR I SAID NO MORE
SHE IS CALLED MRS GRAHAM AND SHE IS IN MOURNING--NOT WIDOW'S WEEDS BUT SLIGHTISH MOURNING--AND SHE IS QUITE YOUNG THEY SAY,--NOT ABOVE FIVE OR SIX AND TWENTY,--BUT SO RESERVED
AND IN A LITTLE WHILE HE PUT HIS SISTER'S LETTER INTO MY HAND
HE WAS ALONE OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GONE OH CONFOUND IT
HAPPILY THERE WERE NONE OF ARTHUR'S FRIENDS INVITED TO GRASSDALE LAST AUTUMN
MR HARGRAVE HAD NOT AN OPPORTUNITY OF MEETING ME AGAIN IN PRIVATE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THIS
WHAT IN THE DEVIL'S NAME IS THIS HELEN CRIED HE
AND I CHARGE YOU UPON YOUR HONOUR AS A GENTLEMAN IF YOU HAVE ANY TO ANSWER TRULY
I NO LONGER REGARDED IT AS ANY CONCERN OF MINE AND IF IT WAS MY DUTY TO ENLIGHTEN LORD LOWBOROUGH IT WAS A PAINFUL DUTY AND I DREADED TO BE CALLED TO PERFORM IT
SHE'S ALMOST PAST HOPE WELL SAID SHE I'M SURE I HOPE HE'LL MAKE HER A GOOD HUSBAND
NOTWITHSTANDING SHE POSSESSED IN FULL THE BRONTE SERIOUSNESS THE BRONTE STRENGTH OF WILL
IT WAS MR HUNTINGDON THE SON OF UNCLE'S OLD FRIEND I HAVE HEARD YOUR UNCLE SPEAK OF YOUNG MR HUNTINGDON
BUT IF IF WHAT WELL IF I WAS YOU I WOULDN'T HAVE THAT LADY LOWBOROUGH IN THE HOUSE ANOTHER MINUTE--NOT ANOTHER MINUTE I WOULDN'T
AND WHAT DID YOU SAY IT IS NO MATTER WHAT I SAID
AND IF THE ACT IS NOT A WISE ONE MAY HEAVEN PROTECT HER FROM ITS CONSEQUENCES
A CIRCUMSTANCE I MOST DEEPLY REGRETTED BUT COULD NOT AVOID
HE IS AS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE TEMPTING LIQUORS AS HE EVER WISHES TO BE
BUT HE HAS PROMISED TO WRITE OFTEN AND MADE ME PROMISE TO WRITE STILL OFTENER BECAUSE HE WILL BE BUSY SETTLING HIS AFFAIRS AND I SHALL HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LOOKING THROUGH A PERSON'S EYES INTO THE HEART AND LEARNING MORE OF THE HEIGHT AND BREADTH AND DEPTH OF ANOTHER'S SOUL IN ONE HOUR THAN IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A LIFETIME TO DISCOVER IF HE OR SHE WERE NOT DISPOSED TO REVEAL IT OR IF YOU HAD NOT THE SENSE TO UNDERSTAND IT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HER THIS EVENING TO BE SURE I AM BUT WHAT WOULD MAMMA SAY GILBERT MAMMA NEEDN'T KNOW BUT SHE MUST KNOW SOME TIME IF YOU GO ON GO ON!--THERE'S NO GOING ON IN THE MATTER
FOREVER ADIEU SO SAID I--AND YET I COULD NOT TEAR MYSELF AWAY
GOOD-BY DEAR FREDERICK
HER MOST BEWITCHING SMILES HER HAUGHTIEST FROWNS WERE EVER RECEIVED WITH THE SAME IMMUTABLE CARELESS GOOD-HUMOUR
IT IS A WOMAN'S NATURE TO BE CONSTANT--TO LOVE ONE AND ONE ONLY BLINDLY TENDERLY AND FOR EVER--BLESS THEM DEAR CREATURES
THE SERVANT HAD JUST BROUGHT IN THE TEA-TRAY
BUT THAT IS NOTHING TO YOU IF HE DOESN'T YOU OUGHT TO TELL HIM MAMMA I HAVE TOLD HIM THE LITTLE MORALIST PAUSED AND PONDERED
AS LITTLE I SHOULD THINK CAN IT MATTER WHETHER THE WRITER SO DESIGNATED IS A MAN OR A WOMAN AS ONE OR TWO OF MY CRITICS PROFESS TO HAVE DISCOVERED
YOU'VE MADE IT ALL COME DOWN OFF WITH YOU THEN!--AN EXCELLENT LITTLE WOMAN HE REMARKED WHEN SHE WAS GONE BUT A THOUGHT TOO SOFT--SHE ALMOST MELTS IN ONE'S HANDS
OH I MUST SEE HER--SHE MUST KNOW MY TRUTH EVEN IF I TOLD IT AT THE CHURCH DOOR
BUT RALLYING IN A MOMENT SHE COOLLY REPLIED THAT IF I SAW ANYTHING AT ALL REPREHENSIBLE OR SUSPICIOUS IN HER CONDUCT SHE WOULD FREELY GIVE ME LEAVE TO TELL HIS LORDSHIP ALL ABOUT IT
WHEN THEY ARE GONE HOW SHALL I GET THROUGH THE MONTHS OR YEARS OF MY FUTURE LIFE IN COMPANY WITH THAT MAN--MY GREATEST ENEMY
IN THE ANTE-ROOM I MET MR HARGRAVE
AND MY OTHER ROOM HAS ASSUMED QUITE A PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS-LIKE APPEARANCE ALREADY
THIS EVENING WHEN I HAD GIVEN RACHEL ALL THE ASSISTANCE I COULD AND HAD NOTHING LEFT ME BUT TO WAIT AND WISH AND TREMBLE I BECAME SO GREATLY AGITATED THAT I KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO
HITHERTO THERE HAD BEEN A KIND OF DESPERATION IN HER HARDIHOOD
AND SINCE THERE EXISTS SO LITTLE SYMPATHY BETWEEN US I THINK WE HAD BETTER EACH LOOK OUT FOR SOME MORE CONGENIAL COMPANION AND FORTHWITH MOVING TO THE WINDOW I BEGAN TO LOOK OUT FOR MY LITTLE SON AND HIS GAY YOUNG FRIEND
I FEAR IT EVEN NOW--I FEAR ANY KIND FRIEND WOULD TELL US WE ARE BOTH DELUDING OURSELVES WITH THE IDEA OF KEEPING UP A SPIRITUAL INTERCOURSE WITHOUT HOPE OR PROSPECT OF ANYTHING FURTHER--WITHOUT FOSTERING VAIN REGRETS AND HURTFUL ASPIRATIONS AND FEEDING THOUGHTS THAT SHOULD BE STERNLY AND PITILESSLY LEFT TO PERISH OF INANITION NEVER MIND OUR KIND FRIENDS
I KNEW HE WOULD FIND IT VERY DULL TO SIT ALONE ALL THE EVENING
I WOULD LOVE YOU CHERISH YOU PROTECT YOU C C
IT WAS A HAZARDOUS ENTERPRISE BOTH FOR HIM AND FOR HER BUT HE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO CONSULT WITH HER ON THE SUBJECT OF HER PROJECTED DEPARTURE IF NOT TO CALM HER APPREHENSIONS RESPECTING HIS HEALTH AND THE WORST RESULT WAS A SLIGHT RELAPSE OF HIS ILLNESS FOR NO ONE KNEW OF THE VISIT BUT THE INMATES OF THE OLD HALL EXCEPT MYSELF
IS HE ONE OF THE PROFLIGATE FRIENDS I WONDER
I HEARD THE HALL-DOOR OPEN AND SHUT AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER ON PUTTING ASIDE THE CURTAIN I SAW HIM PACING DOWN THE PARK IN THE COMFORTLESS GLOOM OF THE DAMP CLOUDY TWILIGHT
AS USUAL WAS THE BRIEF THOUGH SAD REPLY
NOW IF I WENT ON WITH YOU AS I DO WITH HER WHEN I'M IN LONDON YOU'D MAKE THE HOUSE TOO HOT TO HOLD ME AT TIMES I'LL BE SWORN YOU MISTAKE ME
APRIL 4TH.--WE HAVE HAD A DOWNRIGHT QUARREL
I COULD HARDLY REFRAIN FROM PRAISING GOD ALOUD FOR MY DELIVERANCE OR ASTONISHING MY FELLOW-PASSENGERS BY SOME SURPRISING OUTBURST OF HILARITY
WHY MRS HUNTINGDON YOUR HAND TREMBLES AS IF YOU HAD STAKED YOUR ALL UPON IT
INDEED SIR YOU CAN'T REPLIED SHE SETTLING HER COUNTENANCE IN STILL MORE IRON FRIGIDITY THAN BEFORE
HE HAD RISEN HOWEVER UNKNOWN TO ME AND ACTUATED BY SOME BASE SPIRIT OF CURIOSITY BEEN LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER FOR I KNOW NOT HOW LONG
HE WISHES TO SEE YOU OH AUNT!--CAN'T YOU TELL HIM I'M INDISPOSED?--I'M SURE I AM--TO SEE HIM NONSENSE MY DEAR
I HAD TAKEN SEVERAL OF HIS BEST PIECES AND MANIFESTLY BAFFLED HIS PROJECTS
AND I WONDERED HOW I EVER COULD HAVE ADMIRED THEM--HER SISTER'S HONEST FACE AND SMALL GREY OPTICS APPEARED FAR MORE AGREEABLE
HE WAS JESTING THEN I SUPPOSE SAID I AND HERE HE WAS SPEAKING AT RANDOM--AT LEAST I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY HARM IN THOSE LAUGHING BLUE EYES FALSE REASONING HELEN SAID SHE WITH A SIGH
WE WANT TO KNOW IF YOU ARE AT LIBERTY TO JOIN US IN A GO AT THE PHEASANTS WALTER INTERPOSED HATTERSLEY FROM WITHOUT
WHEN SHE WAS GONE I FELT AS IF THERE WAS TO BE NO MORE FUN--THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT SHE HAD CONTRIBUTED TO THE HILARITY OF THE PARTY
FOR ANNABELLA WILMOT IS THE PROBABLE HEIRESS TO ALL HER UNCLE'S WEALTH IN ADDITION TO HER LATE FATHER'S PROPERTY WHICH SHE HAS ALREADY IN POSSESSION
NO MATTER WHERE--THE WHEN IS ALL THAT CONCERNS YOU;--AND I SHALL BE BACK BY DINNER AT LEAST OH--OH
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE AFTER FATE OF THAT LADY'S SISTER I CAN ONLY TELL YOU--WHAT PERHAPS YOU HAVE HEARD FROM ANOTHER QUARTER--THAT SOME TWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEARS AGO SHE RELIEVED THE HAPPY COUPLE OF HER PRESENCE BY MARRYING A WEALTHY TRADESMAN OF L
OH YES
AND WHEN I WANDER IN THE ANCIENT WOODS AND MEET THE LITTLE WILD FLOWERS SMILING IN MY PATH OR SIT IN THE SHADOW OF OUR NOBLE ASH-TREES BY THE WATER-SIDE WITH THEIR BRANCHES GENTLY SWAYING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE THAT MURMURS THROUGH THEIR FEATHERY FOLIAGE--MY EARS FULL OF THAT LOW MUSIC MINGLED WITH THE DREAMY HUM OF INSECTS MY EYES ABSTRACTEDLY GAZING ON THE GLASSY SURFACE OF THE LITTLE LAKE BEFORE ME WITH THE TREES THAT CROWD ABOUT ITS BANK SOME GRACEFULLY BENDING TO KISS ITS WATERS SOME REARING THEIR STATELY HEADS HIGH ABOVE BUT STRETCHING THEIR WIDE ARMS OVER ITS MARGIN ALL FAITHFULLY MIRRORED FAR FAR DOWN IN ITS GLASSY DEPTH--THOUGH SOMETIMES THE IMAGES ARE PARTIALLY BROKEN BY THE SPORT OF AQUATIC INSECTS AND SOMETIMES FOR A MOMENT THE WHOLE IS SHIVERED INTO TREMBLING FRAGMENTS BY A TRANSIENT BREEZE THAT SWEEPS THE SURFACE TOO ROUGHLY--STILL I HAVE NO PLEASURE
I MUST CONFESS TOO THAT I WRONGED HIM IN MY HEART
IF I GOT A WETTING THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH A PRETENDED OVER-EXERTION BEFORE BREAKFAST MIGHT EXCUSE MY SUDDEN LOSS OF APPETITE
THE INVALID HIMSELF LOOKED VERY INTERESTING AS HE LAY RECLINING THERE IN HIS ELEGANT DRESSING-GOWN WITH A SILK HANDKERCHIEF BOUND ACROSS HIS TEMPLES
FREDERICK HAS SUPPLIED ME WITH ALL REQUISITE FURNITURE AND PAINTING MATERIALS
YES DELIGHTED
AND HERE I MUST NOT FORGET THAT I AM NOT A LITTLE INDEBTED TO HIS FRIEND MR HARGRAVE
SHE ACCORDINGLY CHATTED AWAY ADDRESSING HERSELF ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO ME AND WITH THE UTMOST ASSURANCE AND FAMILIARITY GROWING THE MORE ANIMATED AND FRIENDLY THE COLDER AND BRIEFER MY ANSWERS BECAME
BUT THEN THE DAWN OF BITTER RECOLLECTION THAT SUCCEEDED--THE WAKING TO FIND LIFE A BLANK AND WORSE THAN A BLANK TEEMING WITH TORMENT AND MISERY--NOT A MERE BARREN WILDERNESS BUT FULL OF THORNS AND BRIERS--TO FIND MYSELF DECEIVED DUPED HOPELESS MY AFFECTIONS TRAMPLED UPON MY ANGEL NOT AN ANGEL AND MY FRIEND A FIEND INCARNATE--IT WAS WORSE THAN IF I HAD NOT SLEPT AT ALL
THEN YOU WON'T GO TO LONDON ARTHUR I SAID WHEN THE FIRST TRANSPORT OF TEARS AND KISSES HAD SUBSIDED
AT LENGTH HOWEVER HE RESTORED IT TO ME SAYING,--'WELL WELL SINCE YOU VALUE IT SO MUCH I'LL NOT DEPRIVE YOU OF IT TO SHOW HIM HOW I VALUED IT I TORE IT IN TWO AND THREW IT INTO THE FIRE
BUT I WAS NOT GOING TO LAY MYSELF OUT FOR HER AMUSEMENT WHOEVER ELSE MIGHT SO INCLINE
AND SHOULD I SEEK A RECONCILIATION WITH HIM WHEN I FEEL THAT I ABHOR HIM AND THAT HE DESPISES ME
I LAY MY POWERS AT YOUR FEET AND YOU MUST AND SHALL ACCEPT THEM HE EXCLAIMED IMPETUOUSLY STARTING TO HIS FEET
IF YOU HAD WISHED NOT TO ANGER ME YOU SHOULD HAVE HELD YOUR TONGUE FROM THE BEGINNING OR ELSE SPOKEN OUT PLAINLY AND HONESTLY ALL YOU HAD TO SAY SHE TURNED ASIDE HER FACE PULLED OUT HER HANDKERCHIEF ROSE AND WENT TO THE WINDOW WHERE SHE STOOD FOR SOME TIME EVIDENTLY DISSOLVED IN TEARS
AND ALL WHO QUESTION THE GOOD TASTE OF EITHER PARTNER MAY BE THANKFUL IF THEIR RESPECTIVE SELECTIONS AFFORD THEM HALF THE GENUINE SATISFACTION IN THE END OR REPAY THEIR PREFERENCE WITH AFFECTION HALF AS LASTING AND SINCERE
BUT WELL KNOWING THAT TO WHEEDLE AND COAX IS SAFER THAN TO COMMAND SHE JUDICIOUSLY TEMPERS HER DESPOTISM WITH FLATTERY AND BLANDISHMENTS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM DEEM HIMSELF A FAVOURED AND A HAPPY MAN
IS HE A GOOD MAN YES--IN SOME RESPECTS
I HAD NEITHER THE POWER TO COME FORWARD AND INTERRUPT YOU NOR TO WITHDRAW FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF SUCH A SCENE
IT IS ON BUSINESS OF IMPORTANCE THAT I WISH TO SPEAK TO HIM I'LL TELL HIM SIR SAID THE MAN
AND I SAW NO MORE OF MR HUNTINGDON
NO THOUGH I MUST CONFESS IN MY SECRET HEART THAT ARTHUR IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT HIM AT FIRST AND IF I HAD KNOWN HIM IN THE BEGINNING AS THOROUGHLY AS I DO NOW I PROBABLY NEVER SHOULD HAVE LOVED HIM AND IF I LOVED HIM FIRST AND THEN MADE THE DISCOVERY I FEAR I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT MY DUTY NOT TO HAVE MARRIED HIM
I WAS VEXED AT HER INCREDULITY
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT AFTER A FLYING TRANSIT THROUGH PART OF FRANCE AND PART OF ITALY I CAME BACK NEARLY AS IGNORANT AS I WENT HAVING MADE NO ACQUAINTANCE WITH PERSONS AND MANNERS AND VERY LITTLE WITH THINGS MY HEAD SWARMING WITH A MOTLEY CONFUSION OF OBJECTS AND SCENES
HE WILL BE BACK SAID LADY LOWBOROUGH'S VOICE
HERE IS SOME ONE COMING SHE SEEMED VEXED AT THE INTERRUPTION
THEN YOU ARE CONVINCED AT LAST OF YOUR MISTAKE--YOU HAVE AT LENGTH DISCOVERED THAT YOUR DIVINITY IS NOT QUITE THE IMMACULATE I DESIRED YOU NOT TO SPEAK OF HER MISS ELIZA OH I BEG YOUR PARDON
NOW WITH A LITTLE DIFFICULTY I COULD MANAGE
BUT NEVER MIND MILICENT
MAMMA WAS VERY GREATLY DISAPPOINTED AT THE FAILURE OF HER DARLING PROJECT AND VERY VERY ANGRY AT MY OBSTINATE RESISTANCE TO HER WILL AND IS SO STILL
I TOOK THE OLD HALL ONCE ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND I SUPPOSE I MUST TAKE IT AGAIN ON A SNOWY WINTER'S DAY AND THEN AGAIN ON A DARK CLOUDY EVENING
BOOKS CANNOT DIVERT ME
BUT IT WON'T IT SHA'N'T I AM DETERMINED
I AM HUNGRY AND I SEE BEFORE ME A GOOD SUBSTANTIAL DINNER
THIS WAS A RATHER STARTLING PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE
BUT HE SOON DISCOVERED THAT I HAD LEFT HIM AND RUSHING UP AFTER ME CAUGHT ME IN HIS ARMS JUST AS I HAD ENTERED THE CHAMBER AND WAS ABOUT TO SHUT THE DOOR IN HIS FACE
MIND YOU DON'T LEAVE HER ONE STONE UPON ANOTHER MISS WILSON DREW HERSELF UP WITH A LOOK OF FREEZING SCORN BUT SAID NOTHING
AND HE IS THOROUGHLY RESPECTABLE YOU KNOW HELEN--QUITE A LADY'S MAN
CHAPTER XVI JUNE 1ST 1821.--WE HAVE JUST RETURNED TO STANINGLEY--THAT IS WE RETURNED SOME DAYS AGO AND I AM NOT YET SETTLED AND FEEL AS IF I NEVER SHOULD BE
YOU'D BETTER TRY ONCE MORE SAID GRIMSBY LEANING ACROSS THE TABLE
AT PRESENT WE HAVE THE WINTER BEFORE US AND SHE SUDDENLY PAUSED WITH A SUPPRESSED EXCLAMATION STARTED UP FROM HER SEAT AND SAYING EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT HURRIED FROM THE ROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HER
THE YOUNGER GENTLEMAN LAY FAST ASLEEP WITH HIS HEAD PILLOWED ON THE LADY'S LAP
MY AUNT OBSERVES THE CHANGE AND THOUGH SHE HAS NOT INQUIRED THE CAUSE OR MADE ANY REMARK TO ME ON THE SUBJECT I SEE IT GIVES HER PLEASURE
AND IF YOU PERSIST IN THE ATTEMPT BELIEVE ME YOU WILL BITTERLY REPENT IT WHEN THE MISCHIEF IS DONE I AM TO SEND HIM TO SCHOOL I SUPPOSE TO LEARN TO DESPISE HIS MOTHER'S AUTHORITY AND AFFECTION SAID THE LADY WITH RATHER A BITTER SMILE
I MIGHT LIVE A HUNDRED YEARS BUT I COULD NEVER RECOVER FROM THE EFFECTS OF THIS WITHERING BLOW--AND NEVER FORGET IT
THIS IS HATTERSLEY'S--EVERY PAGE STUFFED FULL OF RAILING ACCUSATIONS BITTER CURSES AND LAMENTABLE COMPLAINTS ENDING UP WITH SWEARING THAT HE'LL GET MARRIED HIMSELF IN REVENGE
BUT IT'S YOUR BUSINESS TO PLEASE YOURSELF AND HERS TO PLEASE YOU
THERE WAS ENOUGH OF CONFIDENCE BETWEEN US ALREADY
AFFIRMING IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PALE RETIRING BOOKWORM SHOULD EVER SUMMON COURAGE TO SEEK A WIFE OR BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ONE IF HE DID AND EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PLAIN-LOOKING PLAIN-DEALING UNATTRACTIVE UNCONCILIATING MISS MILLWARD SHOULD EVER FIND A HUSBAND
BUT MY PORTFOLIO WAS ON THE TABLE
AND TO LOATHE THE VERY SOUND OF YOUR VOICE AND SHUDDER AT YOUR APPROACH SHE NEVER WILL
IN THOSE PARTS IT WAS CUSTOMARY TO SIT TO THE TABLE AT TEA-TIME ON ALL OCCASIONS AND MAKE A MEAL OF IT FOR WE DINED EARLY
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE OF DEATH
BUT BE ASSURED LOVE I SHALL NOT BE LONG AWAY I DON'T WISH TO KEEP YOU A PRISONER AT HOME I REPLIED
HER BROTHER WENT TO STANINGLEY TO ATTEND THE FUNERAL AND TOLD ME UPON HIS RETURN THAT SHE WAS STILL THERE ENDEAVOURING TO CHEER HER AUNT WITH HER PRESENCE AND LIKELY TO REMAIN SOME TIME
THE DOOR WAS FASTENED BUT AFTER DUE KNOCKING AND WAITING AND SOME PARLEYING WITH A VOICE FROM AN UPPER WINDOW WE WERE ADMITTED BY AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED TO AIR AND KEEP THE HOUSE TILL OUR ARRIVAL INTO A TOLERABLY SNUG LITTLE APARTMENT FORMERLY THE SCULLERY OF THE MANSION WHICH FREDERICK HAD NOW FITTED UP AS A KITCHEN
AND POOR RACHEL TOO CAME IN FOR HER SHARE OF ABUSE AS USUAL
WHEN I'M WITH PAPA IF I SAY MAMMA WANTS ME OR MAMMA SAYS I'M NOT TO DO SOMETHING THAT HE TELLS ME TO DO HE ALWAYS SAYS MAMMA BE DAMNED AND RACHEL SAYS IT'S ONLY WICKED PEOPLE THAT ARE DAMNED
HEAVEN KNOWS I HAVE HAD TORMENT ENOUGH AT THE BARE POSSIBILITY OF THAT
NOR ANY OTHER THING THAT I EVER HEARD OF EXCEPT GENUINE GOOD SENSE UNSWERVING INTEGRITY ACTIVE PIETY WARM-HEARTED BENEVOLENCE AND A FUND OF CHEERFUL SPIRITS
BECAUSE I HAD NOT THE HYPOCRISY TO PROFESS ANY ANXIETY FOR HIS RECOVERY AND I HAD NOT THE FACE TO EXPRESS ANY DESIRE FOR A CONTRARY RESULT
THE PIANO'S VACANT IT WAS FOR I HAD QUITTED IT IMMEDIATELY UPON HEARING HIS PETITION
ON PERCEIVING ME SHE TURNED ROUND EXCLAIMING WITH A LAUGH THAT SAVOURED MORE OF MALICE THAN OF MIRTH,--'WHY HELEN
ARE YOU NOT LATELY RETURNED FROM LONDON I ASKED
HOW SHALL I ENCOUNTER THEM ALL
I USED TO MEET HIM OCCASIONALLY IN THE TOWN
BUT ONE MILD SUNSHINY DAY EARLY IN NOVEMBER I HAD VENTURED FORTH ALONE TO VISIT THE VILLAGE SCHOOL AND A FEW OF THE POOR TENANTS AND ON MY RETURN I WAS ALARMED AT THE CLATTER OF A HORSE'S FEET BEHIND ME APPROACHING AT A RAPID STEADY TROT
I HAVE GIVEN TWO WHOLE DAYS TO THE PREPARATION FOR OUR DEPARTURE THAT FREDERICK MAY HAVE MORE TIME TO PREPARE THE ROOMS AND RACHEL TO PACK UP THE THINGS
TEN WEEKS WAS LONG TO WAIT IN SUCH A MISERABLE STATE OF UNCERTAINTY
I WILL IF--IF I MUST YOU ARE CHANGED PERSISTED SHE--'YOU ARE GROWN EITHER VERY PROUD OR VERY INDIFFERENT I AM NEITHER HELEN--MRS HUNTINGDON
BUT WHY LEAVE ME I SAID
BUT TO ME HE ALWAYS AVOWED IT HIS INTENTION TO STAY TILL THE PRESENT MONTH IT STRUCK ME LIKE A BLOW THIS PROOF OF PREMEDITATED TRANSGRESSION AND SYSTEMATIC DISREGARD OF TRUTH
WHAT GOING ALREADY LOWBOROUGH SAID HE
IT WAS A CLEAR FROSTY MORNING
HERE THEN I SET UP MY EASEL AND HERE I WORKED AT MY CANVAS FROM DAYLIGHT TILL DUSK WITH VERY LITTLE INTERMISSION SAVING WHEN PURE NECESSITY OR MY DUTIES TO LITTLE ARTHUR CALLED ME AWAY
BUT HE PUSHED ON BESIDE ME AND BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER AND THE CROPS
AND YET UPON HIS RETURN HE TALKED TO MY AUNT ABOUT THE SERMON WITH A DEGREE OF MODEST SERIOUS DISCRIMINATION THAT TEMPTED ME TO BELIEVE HE HAD REALLY ATTENDED TO AND PROFITED BY THE DISCOURSE
YES I CONTINUED
BUT MY AUNT KNOWS BETTER
THEY WOULD THINK ME MAD
HE IS HOLDING MY LEFT HAND NOW WHILE I WRITE
EVERY ONE ATTENDED THE MORNING SERVICE EXCEPT MY UNCLE WHO HARDLY EVER GOES AND MR WILMOT WHO STAYED AT HOME WITH HIM TO ENJOY A QUIET GAME OF CRIBBAGE
THIS IS DELIGHTFUL ISN'T IT SAID HE WITH A MALICIOUS GRIN AS I HELD IT TO HIS LIPS
ON THE NIGHT OF MY ARRIVAL WHEN I FIRST ENTERED HIS ROOM HE WAS LYING IN A KIND OF HALF DELIRIUM
PERHAPS HER BROTHER
BUT ON ONE OCCASION WHEN ARTHUR HAD BEEN BEHAVING PARTICULARLY ILL AND MR HUNTINGDON AND HIS GUESTS HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY PROVOKING AND INSULTING TO ME IN THEIR ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIM AND I PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO GET HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND ON THE VERY POINT OF DEMEANING MYSELF BY A BURST OF UNCONTROLLABLE PASSION--MR HARGRAVE SUDDENLY ROSE FROM HIS SEAT WITH AN ASPECT OF STERN DETERMINATION LIFTED THE CHILD FROM HIS FATHER'S KNEE WHERE HE WAS SITTING HALF-TIPSY COCKING HIS HEAD AND LAUGHING AT ME AND EXECRATING ME WITH WORDS HE LITTLE KNEW THE MEANING OF HANDED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND SETTING HIM DOWN IN THE HALL HELD THE DOOR OPEN FOR ME GRAVELY BOWED AS I WITHDREW AND CLOSED IT AFTER ME
THE LATE HOURS AND LONDON HABITS WOULD NOT SUIT ME UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
THE QUESTIONS YOU ARE REQUESTED TO SOLVE ARE THESE:--FIRST CONCERNING YOUR BIRTH EXTRACTION AND PREVIOUS RESIDENCE
SO WITH A MUTTERED EXECRATION I LEFT THE FELLOW TO HIS FATE AND CLAPPING SPURS TO MY OWN HORSE GALLOPED AWAY EXCITED BY A COMBINATION OF FEELINGS IT WOULD NOT BE EASY TO ANALYSE
NOW MILICENT TELL ME WHAT YOU WERE CRYING FOR I'LL TELL YOU SOME OTHER TIME MURMURED SHE WHEN WE ARE ALONE TELL ME NOW SAID HE WITH ANOTHER SHAKE AND A SQUEEZE THAT MADE HER DRAW IN HER BREATH AND BITE HER LIP TO SUPPRESS A CRY OF PAIN
I STARTLED YOU ARTHUR SAID I LAUGHING IN MY GLEE
AND ON THAT ACCOUNT I'LL FORGIVE YOU
AND THEN I CAN ASSIST YOU TO DESCEND THIS DIFFICULT PATH THANK YOU--I ALWAYS MANAGE BEST ON SUCH OCCASIONS WITHOUT ASSISTANCE BUT AT LEAST I CAN CARRY YOUR STOOL AND SKETCH-BOOK SHE DID NOT DENY ME THIS FAVOUR
SITTING ON OUR BOXES WITH NOTHING TO CLING TO NOTHING TO LEAN AGAINST SLOWLY DRAGGED AND CRUELLY SHAKEN OVER THE ROUGH HILLY ROADS
I HOPED SHE AND MY UNCLE WOULD PARDON THE STEP I HAD TAKEN FOR IF THEY KNEW ALL I WAS SURE THEY WOULD NOT BLAME ME
BUT STILL IT WAS LESS THE DISAPPOINTMENT TO MYSELF THAT ANNOYED ME THAN THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIM AND THE TROUBLE I WAS AT TO FRAME EXCUSES TO MY FRIENDS FOR HAVING SEEN AND OBSERVED SO LITTLE WITHOUT IMPUTING ONE PARTICLE OF BLAME TO MY COMPANION
ARTHUR WAS VEXED TO HEAR OF IT BECAUSE HE SAW THAT I WAS SHOCKED AND GRIEVED AND HE FEARED THE CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD MAR HIS COMFORT
SAY I AM NOT WELL TO-NIGHT AND WISH TO BE EXCUSED I RETIRED INTO THE LARGE EMPTY DINING-ROOM WHERE ALL WAS SILENCE AND DARKNESS BUT FOR THE SOFT SIGHING OF THE WIND WITHOUT AND THE FAINT GLEAM OF MOONLIGHT THAT PIERCED THE BLINDS AND CURTAINS
HOW VERY VERY GOOD YOU ARE NAY NOT I SAID HE TURNING HER ROUND AND PUSHING HER TOWARDS ME
I CANNOT ENJOY MY MUSIC BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE TO HEAR IT
BUT THE MORE HE TRIES TO CONCILIATE ME THE MORE I SHRINK FROM HIM AND FROM THE FUTURE
YOU SHALL ANSWER MY QUESTION EXCLAIMED HER TORMENTOR
SEND THOSE CHILDREN AWAY AND STAY WITH ME NO
AND WE SHOULD CALL SOME TIME MAMMA
NO NO
NO NO
NO NO
NO NO
BUT I CANNOT SAY THAT IT MOVED ME VERY DEEPLY
OH HELEN I COULD NOT WAIT SO LONG WHERE IS YOUR FIDELITY I MEAN I COULD NOT ENDURE THE MISERY OF SO LONG A SEPARATION IT WOULD NOT BE A SEPARATION
I NOW INSISTED UPON RETRACING OUR STEPS TO THE HOUSE
AND IF THE STAR OF HER DIVINITY BE BRIGHT ENOUGH TO DIM THE LUSTRE OF ELIZA'S SO MUCH THE BETTER BUT I SCARCELY CAN THINK IT AND THEREAFTER I SELDOM SUFFERED A FINE DAY TO PASS WITHOUT PAYING A VISIT TO WILDFELL ABOUT THE TIME MY NEW ACQUAINTANCE USUALLY LEFT HER HERMITAGE
AS FAR AS IN ME LIES I ENDEAVOUR TO LIVE PEACEABLY WITH HIM
A GROUP OF DARK SCOTCH FIRS WAS INTRODUCED IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE TO RELIEVE THE PREVAILING FRESHNESS OF THE REST
HAS SHE TOLD YOU SO NO BUT I CAN NO LONGER DOUBT IT
CHAPTER XXI OCTOBER 1ST.--ALL IS SETTLED NOW
HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE DRAWING-ROOM HUMMING SNATCHES OF TUNES AND NIBBLING THE END OF HIS CANE
THEN WHILE I LIFTED UP MY SOUL IN SPEECHLESS EARNEST SUPPLICATION SOME HEAVENLY INFLUENCE SEEMED TO STRENGTHEN ME WITHIN
BUT SUCH IDEAS ARE BANISHED IN A MOMENT WITH HORROR AND SELF-ABASEMENT
SHE SAID SHE WAS BETTER
THE MORE THE MERRIER--AND I'M SURE WE SHALL WANT ALL THE CHEERFULNESS WE CAN CARRY WITH US TO THAT GREAT DARK GLOOMY ROOM WITH ITS NARROW LATTICED WINDOWS AND ITS DISMAL OLD FURNITURE--UNLESS SHE SHOWS US INTO HER STUDIO AGAIN SO WE WENT ALL IN A BODY
YOU ARE MISTAKEN--I DON'T--THAT IS--I HAVE SEEN HER CERTAINLY
BUT SLEEP WAS SWEET AND REFRESHING WHEN IT CAME AND THE WAKING WAS DELIGHTFUL BEYOND EXPRESSION
IS IT MY FAULT THAT I HAVE LOST MY INFLUENCE WITH HIM OR THAT HE HAS FORFEITED EVERY CLAIM TO MY REGARD
FIRST HE MURMURED BLESS YOU DARLING AND RETURNED MY CLOSE EMBRACE WITH A FERVOUR LIKE OLD TIMES AND THEN HE STARTED AND IN A TONE OF ABSOLUTE TERROR EXCLAIMED HELEN
ACHING WITH WEARINESS AND DESPERATION I HURRIED ON
MY FRIEND MARKHAM MRS LAWRENCE LATE MISS HARGRAVE I BOWED TO THE BRIDE AND VEHEMENTLY WRUNG THE BRIDEGROOM'S HAND
SHE NEVER SPEAKS A WORD AGAINST HIM
SHE IS NOT OUT OF THE SCHOOL-ROOM YET BUT HER MOTHER FREQUENTLY BRINGS HER OVER TO CALL IN THE MORNINGS WHEN THE GENTLEMEN ARE OUT AND SOMETIMES SHE SPENDS AN HOUR OR TWO IN COMPANY WITH HER SISTER AND ME AND THE CHILDREN
NEXT MORNING THE DOCTOR ORDERED HIM TO BE BLED
BUT SEEING ME SO CALM AND COOL HE WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD DISTURB MY PHILOSOPHY
SHORTLY AFTER I WITH LITTLE ARTHUR AND RACHEL WENT TO STANINGLEY MY DEAR OLD HOME WHICH AS WELL AS MY DEAR OLD FRIENDS ITS INHABITANTS I SAW AGAIN WITH MINGLED FEELINGS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN SO INTIMATELY BLENDED THAT I COULD SCARCELY DISTINGUISH THE ONE FROM THE OTHER OR TELL TO WHICH TO ATTRIBUTE THE VARIOUS TEARS AND SMILES AND SIGHS AWAKENED BY THOSE OLD FAMILIAR SCENES AND TONES AND FACES
I DREW BACK
BUT FEARING HE WOULD OBEY TOO WELL AND NEVER COME AGAIN I HASTILY ADDED--'OR SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY AND HAVE DONE WITH IT BUT WHICH SAID HE--'FOR I SHALL ONLY SAY IT IF YOU REALLY WERE THINKING OF ME
THEN HAD SHE AND YOU GOT ON SO WELL TOGETHER AS TO COME TO THE GIVING AND RECEIVING OF PRESENTS?'--NOT PRECISELY OLD BUCK
I MUST WAIT A LITTLE
YOU HAVE DISPLEASED ME I REPLIED AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE OR HEAR YOUR VOICE AGAIN TILL THE MORNING HE PAUSED A MOMENT AS IF DUMFOUNDED OR UNCERTAIN HOW TO ANSWER SUCH A SPEECH AND THEN TURNED AND WALKED AWAY
THE FORMER WALKED IN AND STOOD WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SURVEYING MR HARGRAVE AND ME PARTICULARLY THE FORMER WITH A SMILE OF INSUPPORTABLE MEANING ACCOMPANIED AS IT WAS BY THE IMPUDENCE OF HIS BRAZEN BROW AND THE SLY MALICIOUS TWINKLE OF HIS EYE
FOR WHEN HE HAD TAKEN A MOUTHFUL OF BREAD AND BUTTER AND WAS ABOUT TO SWALLOW A GULP OF TEA THE HUMOUR OF THE THING BURST UPON HIM WITH SUCH IRRESISTIBLE FORCE THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO JUMP UP FROM THE TABLE AND RUSH SNORTING AND CHOKING FROM THE ROOM
SHE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH TO PURIFY AND ETHEREALISE HER SOUL BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REFINE AWAY HER HEART AND RAISE HER ABOVE ALL HUMAN SYMPATHIES AND AM I ABOVE ALL HUMAN SYMPATHIES SAID I
AND AFTER THAT HE WAS MORE SUBDUED AND TRANQUIL
BUT YOU MADAM--I EQUALLY MAINTAIN THERE IS NOBODY LIKE YOU
PALETTE PAINTS BLADDERS PENCILS BRUSHES VARNISH
AND APPROACHING THE HIGH CARVED CHIMNEY-PIECE I LEANT MY HAND AGAINST ITS HEAVY MOULDINGS AND DROPPED MY FOREHEAD UPON IT IN SILENT SULLEN DESPONDENCY
I'LL HAVE THE HEART OUT OF YOUR BODY MAN IF YOU IRRITATE ME WITH ANY MORE OF THAT IMBECILE LAUGHTER!--WHAT
I WAS MISTAKEN HOWEVER
HER ATTAINMENTS WERE LIMITED HER INTELLECT NOWAYS ABOVE MEDIOCRITY
TURNING BACK LEAF AFTER LEAF TO FIND AN EXPLANATION OF WHAT HE HAD READ
13TH.--THEY ARE GONE AND HE IS GONE
THEY CAME SLOWER AND SLOWER AND MORE TERSE AND CARELESS EVERY TIME
SOME SAY WELL MR FERGUS I'LL TELL YOU
MOORLAND SCENE WITH COTTAGE HAWORTH I KNOW I DID
MY AUNT FLATTERS HERSELF I SHALL SOON FORGET HIM--PERHAPS SHE THINKS I HAVE FORGOTTEN HIM ALREADY FOR I NEVER MENTION HIS NAME
HE COMMENCED A PASSIONATE PROTESTATION OF THE TRUTH AND FERVOUR OF HIS ATTACHMENT WHICH I CUT SHORT BY ANOTHER QUESTION BUT IS IT NOT A SELFISH LOVE
AND IF ANNABELLA KNEW THE VALUE OF TRUE WISDOM AND THE MISERY OF FOLLY AND--AND INTEMPERANCE SHE WOULD NOT TALK SUCH NONSENSE--EVEN IN JEST HE RAISED HIS EYES WHILE I SPOKE AND GRAVELY TURNED THEM UPON ME WITH A HALF-SURPRISED HALF-ABSTRACTED LOOK AND THEN BENT THEM ON HIS WIFE
BUT WHEN HAVING ASKED FOR A GLASS OF WATER WHILE I HELD IT TO HIS LIPS HE MURMURED THANKS DEAREST I COULD NOT HELP DISTINCTLY OBSERVING YOU WOULD NOT SAY SO IF YOU KNEW ME INTENDING TO FOLLOW THAT UP WITH ANOTHER DECLARATION OF MY IDENTITY
IT WAS PARTLY OPEN AND MR HUNTINGDON MUST HAVE SEEN ME AS HE WENT BY FOR IN HALF A MINUTE HE CAME BACK AND SETTING HIS GUN AGAINST THE WALL THREW UP THE SASH AND SPRANG IN AND SET HIMSELF BEFORE MY PICTURE
I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW HIM BUT REMAINED SEATED IN THE ARM-CHAIR SPEECHLESS TEARLESS AND ALMOST MOTIONLESS TILL HE RETURNED ABOUT HALF-AN-HOUR AFTER AND WALKING UP TO ME HELD THE CANDLE IN MY FACE AND PEERED INTO MY EYES WITH LOOKS AND LAUGHTER TOO INSULTING TO BE BORNE
I HAVE GOT A LONG LETTER FROM HER THIS MORNING TELLING ME SHE IS ALREADY ENGAGED AND EXPECTS TO BE MARRIED BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE MONTH
AND HE PERSISTED IN HIS INCREDULITY
HELEN SAID HE MORE GRAVELY DO YOU KNOW THAT IF I BELIEVED YOU NOW I SHOULD BE VERY ANGRY
OR IF SHE DID THE PEOPLE WERE QUIET AND HARMLESS SHE WAS WELL ASSURED
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO INJURE YOURSELF ESPECIALLY BY SUCH ACTS AS WE ALLUDE TO WITHOUT INJURING HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS BESIDES IN A GREATER OR LESS DEGREE EITHER BY THE EVIL YOU DO OR THE GOOD YOU LEAVE UNDONE AND AS I WAS SAYING CONTINUED HE OR WOULD HAVE SAID IF YOU HADN'T TAKEN ME UP SO SHORT I SOMETIMES THINK I SHOULD DO BETTER IF I WERE JOINED TO ONE THAT WOULD ALWAYS REMIND ME WHEN I WAS WRONG AND GIVE ME A MOTIVE FOR DOING GOOD AND ESCHEWING EVIL BY DECIDEDLY SHOWING HER APPROVAL OF THE ONE AND DISAPPROVAL OF THE OTHER IF YOU HAD NO HIGHER MOTIVE THAN THE APPROVAL OF YOUR FELLOW-MORTAL IT WOULD DO YOU LITTLE GOOD WELL BUT IF I HAD A MATE THAT WOULD NOT ALWAYS BE YIELDING AND ALWAYS EQUALLY KIND BUT THAT WOULD HAVE THE SPIRIT TO STAND AT BAY NOW AND THEN AND HONESTLY TELL ME HER MIND AT ALL TIMES SUCH A ONE AS YOURSELF FOR INSTANCE
I WANT TO SPEAK TO HELEN A MINUTE
TREMBLING WITH ANGER AND AGITATION AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT BESIDES I BROKE AWAY AND GOT MY CANDLE AND RUSHED UP-STAIRS TO MY ROOM
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO ARTHUR SAID I
YES HUMPH
IT MUST BE EITHER THAT YOU THINK SHE IS ESSENTIALLY SO VICIOUS OR SO FEEBLE-MINDED THAT SHE CANNOT WITHSTAND TEMPTATION,--AND THOUGH SHE MAY BE PURE AND INNOCENT AS LONG AS SHE IS KEPT IN IGNORANCE AND RESTRAINT YET BEING DESTITUTE OF REAL VIRTUE TO TEACH HER HOW TO SIN IS AT ONCE TO MAKE HER A SINNER AND THE GREATER HER KNOWLEDGE THE WIDER HER LIBERTY THE DEEPER WILL BE HER DEPRAVITY,--WHEREAS IN THE NOBLER SEX THERE IS A NATURAL TENDENCY TO GOODNESS GUARDED BY A SUPERIOR FORTITUDE WHICH THE MORE IT IS EXERCISED BY TRIALS AND DANGERS IS ONLY THE FURTHER DEVELOPED HEAVEN FORBID THAT I SHOULD THINK SO I INTERRUPTED HER AT LAST
FOR YOU CAN BOAST A GOOD FAMILY A PRETTY CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE AND EXPECTATIONS AND I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU LIKEWISE--FOR IF I DON'T OTHERS WILL--THAT YOU HAVE A FAIR SHARE OF BEAUTY BESIDES--AND I HOPE YOU MAY NEVER HAVE CAUSE TO REGRET IT I HOPE NOT AUNT
I SOMETIMES THINK SHE HAS NO FEELING AT ALL
ONLY FOR A MOMENT PLEADED SHE
OH DON'T TELL HER GILBERT CRIED SHE
AND WHEN YOU HAVE ONCE EXTINGUISHED MY LOVE YOU WILL FIND IT NO EASY MATTER TO KINDLE IT AGAIN WELL HELEN I WON'T REPEAT THE OFFENCE
WE SEEMED INDEED TO BE MUTUALLY PLEASED WITH EACH OTHER AND MANAGED TO MAINTAIN BETWEEN US A CHEERFUL AND ANIMATED THOUGH NOT VERY PROFOUND CONVERSATION
HELEN YOU MUST SAVE ME AND HE EARNESTLY SEIZED MY HAND AND LOOKED INTO MY FACE WITH SUCH IMPLORING EAGERNESS THAT MY HEART BLED FOR HIM AND I COULD NOT SPEAK FOR TEARS
DO YOU BELIEVE THEM RACHEL I ASKED AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
IT PUZZLES ME WHAT YOU CAN FIND TO BE SO MERRY ABOUT
YOU THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO KIDNAP YOUR SON I SUPPOSE SHE STROKED HIS HEAD WITH A HALF-EMBARRASSED LAUGH AND REPLIED,--'I DID NOT KNOW HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO CLIMB THE WALL.--I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ADDRESSING MR MARKHAM I BELIEVE SHE ADDED SOMEWHAT ABRUPTLY
IT IS NOT ALL KINDNESS TO YOU
THIS SOUNDED RATHER TOO ARROGANT AND THE SMILE THAT ACCOMPANIED IT DID NOT PLEASE ME
I DID INDEED DESIRE HIM TO FORGET YOU I SAID AND ESPECIALLY TO FORGET THE LESSONS YOU TAUGHT HIM
AND WAS SHE CONSIDERING HOW TO REPULSE ME WITH THE SMALLEST INJURY TO MY FEELINGS
OH FREDERICK
IT IS RATHER THE TRUTH OF A TRACT OR A REPORT
NOW THOUGHT I IF I HAD BUT A PENCIL AND A MORSEL OF PAPER I COULD MAKE A LOVELIER SKETCH THAN HERS ADMITTING I HAD THE POWER TO DELINEATE FAITHFULLY WHAT IS BEFORE ME BUT THOUGH THIS SATISFACTION WAS DENIED ME I WAS VERY WELL CONTENT TO SIT BESIDE HER THERE AND SAY NOTHING
BUT I FELT A TEAR ON MY NECK AS SHE DROPPED HER HEAD ON MY BOSOM AND CONTINUED WITH AN ODD MIXTURE OF SADNESS AND LEVITY TIMIDITY AND AUDACITY,--'I KNOW YOU ARE NOT SO HAPPY AS I MEAN TO BE FOR YOU SPEND HALF YOUR LIFE ALONE AT GRASSDALE WHILE MR HUNTINGDON GOES ABOUT ENJOYING HIMSELF WHERE AND HOW HE PLEASES
NOTHING COULD CONVINCE HIM THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS DISAGREEABLE
SHORTLY HOWEVER THE EFFERVESCENCE BEGAN TO ABATE AND NOT MANY MINUTES ELAPSED BEFORE I HAD TURNED AND GONE BACK TO LOOK AFTER THE FATE OF MY VICTIM
I THINK THE DAY I LAST MENTIONED WAS A CERTAIN SUNDAY THE LATEST IN THE OCTOBER OF 1827
I SHED NO TEARS BEFORE BUT NOW THEY CAME FAST AND FREE
AND THIS TIME I WAS MADE SENSIBLE OF IT BY A SUDDEN DIG IN THE RIBS FROM THE ELBOW OF MY PERT BROTHER
AND LOOK AT THIS
I WOULD NOT SUSPECT MY HUSBAND FALSELY ON THIS MAN'S ACCUSATION AND I WOULD NOT TRUST HIM UNWORTHILY--I MUST KNOW THE TRUTH AT ONCE
BUT HE MERELY MUTTERED AN INCOHERENT REPLY SO I DROPPED IT AGAIN TILL SOME TIME AFTER WHEN AS I WAS BATHING HIS FOREHEAD AND TEMPLES WITH VINEGAR AND WATER TO RELIEVE THE HEAT AND PAIN IN HIS HEAD HE OBSERVED AFTER LOOKING EARNESTLY UPON ME FOR SOME MINUTES I HAVE SUCH STRANGE FANCIES--I CAN'T GET RID OF THEM AND THEY WON'T LET ME REST
AND I TOOK GREAT CREDIT TO MYSELF FOR ATTENDING SO PROMPTLY TO ITS DICTATES--AND JUDGING THE MERIT OF THE DEED BY THE SACRIFICE IT COST I WAS NOT FAR WRONG
BUT LOWBOROUGH DETECTED THE PANTOMIME AND NETTLED AT THE INTELLIGENT GRINS THAT WERE PASSING BETWEEN US SNATCHED THE GLASS FROM MY HAND DASHED THE CONTENTS OF IT IN GRIMSBY'S FACE THREW THE EMPTY TUMBLER AT ME AND THEN BOLTED FROM THE ROOM I HOPE HE BROKE YOUR HEAD SAID I
SHE THINKS ME AN IMPUDENT PUPPY THOUGHT I
BUT SINCE OUR FATHER'S DEATH I HAVE ONLY SEEN HIM ONCE WHEN HE CAME FOR A FEW DAYS WHILE MR HUNTINGDON WAS AWAY
THEN LOVE
HE MAY DRINK HIMSELF DEAD BUT IT IS NOT MY FAULT
HIM I STILL FEEL THAT I COULD PARDON--FREELY GLADLY--ON THE SLIGHTEST TOKEN OF REPENTANCE
NOW SHE'S A POOR LITTLE BIT OF A CREATURE FADING AND MELTING AWAY LIKE A SNOW-WREATH
BUT HE'LL FIND HIMSELF IN A FIX WHEN HE'S GOT HER I DOUBT AND SHE'LL FIND HERSELF IN A FIX WHEN SHE'S GOT HIM SAID I IF WHAT I'VE HEARD OF HIM IS TRUE NOT A BIT OF IT
I HAVE NOT YET SAID THAT A BOY SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO RUSH INTO THE SNARES OF LIFE,--OR EVEN WILFULLY TO SEEK TEMPTATION FOR THE SAKE OF EXERCISING HIS VIRTUE BY OVERCOMING IT;--I ONLY SAY THAT IT IS BETTER TO ARM AND STRENGTHEN YOUR HERO THAN TO DISARM AND ENFEEBLE THE FOE;--AND IF YOU WERE TO REAR AN OAK SAPLING IN A HOTHOUSE TENDING IT CAREFULLY NIGHT AND DAY AND SHIELDING IT FROM EVERY BREATH OF WIND YOU COULD NOT EXPECT IT TO BECOME A HARDY TREE LIKE THAT WHICH HAS GROWN UP ON THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE EXPOSED TO ALL THE ACTION OF THE ELEMENTS AND NOT EVEN SHELTERED FROM THE SHOCK OF THE TEMPEST GRANTED;--BUT WOULD YOU USE THE SAME ARGUMENT WITH REGARD TO A GIRL CERTAINLY NOT NO
HA HA YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN HER YET
EACH OF THESE TIMES I INQUIRED AFTER THE PICTURE SHE WAS PAINTING FROM THE SKETCH TAKEN ON THE CLIFF AND WAS ADMITTED INTO THE STUDIO AND ASKED MY OPINION OR ADVICE RESPECTING ITS PROGRESS
AND AS FOR THE DANGER OF THE BELIEF I WOULD NOT PUBLISH IT ABROAD IF I THOUGHT ANY POOR WRETCH WOULD BE LIKELY TO PRESUME UPON IT TO HIS OWN DESTRUCTION BUT IT IS A GLORIOUS THOUGHT TO CHERISH IN ONE'S OWN HEART AND I WOULD NOT PART WITH IT FOR ALL THE WORLD CAN GIVE HERE OUR CONFERENCE ENDED FOR IT WAS NOW HIGH TIME TO PREPARE FOR CHURCH
AND THE VICAR HAS BEEN TO SCOLD ME FOR MY NEGLECT OF THE ORDINANCES OF RELIGION
DO SIT HERE A LITTLE AND REST AND TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE THIS ARBOUR SAID I AND LIFTING ARTHUR BY THE SHOULDERS I PLANTED HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEAT BY WAY OF SECURING HIS MAMMA WHO ACKNOWLEDGING IT TO BE A TEMPTING PLACE OF REFUGE THREW HERSELF BACK IN ONE CORNER WHILE I TOOK POSSESSION OF THE OTHER
THE OTHER LADIES I SUPPOSE FOR THE SAKE OF APPEARANCES AND TO KEEP ME IN CHECK AND MAKE ME DISCREET AND CIVIL IN MY DEMEANOUR
MY HEART WAS BEGINNING TO THROB BUT I CHECKED IT WITH AN INTERNAL REBUKE AND MAINTAINED MY COMPOSURE--OUTWARDLY AT LEAST
THERE IS A LIKENESS ABOUT THE EYES AND COMPLEXION I THINK REPLIED SHE SOMEWHAT DUBIOUSLY SURVEYING MY FACE;--'AND I THINK I SAW YOU AT CHURCH ON SUNDAY I SMILED.--THERE WAS SOMETHING EITHER IN THAT SMILE OR THE RECOLLECTIONS IT AWAKENED THAT WAS PARTICULARLY DISPLEASING TO HER FOR SHE SUDDENLY ASSUMED AGAIN THAT PROUD CHILLY LOOK THAT HAD SO UNSPEAKABLY ROUSED MY AVERSION AT CHURCH--A LOOK OF REPELLENT SCORN SO EASILY ASSUMED AND SO ENTIRELY WITHOUT THE LEAST DISTORTION OF A SINGLE FEATURE THAT WHILE THERE IT SEEMED LIKE THE NATURAL EXPRESSION OF THE FACE AND WAS THE MORE PROVOKING TO ME BECAUSE I COULD NOT THINK IT AFFECTED
YES IT WOULD CRIED THE OTHER FOLLOWING HIM INTO THE HALL
I THINK IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN VERY GENUINE STUFF TO BEGIN WITH IF IT'S SO EASILY DEMOLISHED
HER FONDNESS FOR HER LITTLE PUPIL WAS OVERSTRAINED AND I WAS OBLIGED TO REMONSTRATE WITH HER ON THE SUBJECT OF OVER-INDULGENCE AND INJUDICIOUS PRAISE
BUT HE GREW ANGRY AT MY DELAY SO I KISSED HIM AND RAN BACK TO THE HOUSE
HAD THE WEATHER AT ALL PERMITTED HE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE ORDERED HIS HORSE AND SET OFF TO SOME DISTANT REGION NO MATTER WHERE IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST AND NOT RETURNED TILL NIGHT
COVERTLY TEARING AWAY THE LEAF SHE CRUMPLED IT UP AND PUT IT IN THE FIRE AND THEN EMPLOYED HERSELF IN TURNING OVER THE PAGES OF THE BOOK AND REALLY OR APPARENTLY PERUSING ITS CONTENTS
OH I WILL RELIEVE HER OF MY PRESENCE THOUGHT I
I'M GOING TO REFORM OH THAT'S NOTHING NEW
CHAPTER X WHEN ALL WERE GONE I LEARNT THAT THE VILE SLANDER HAD INDEED BEEN CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF THE VICTIM
CONSEQUENTLY LADY LOWBOROUGH AND I HAD THE PLEASURE OF RETURNING TETE-A-TETE IN THE CARRIAGE TOGETHER
THIS WAS BAD NEWS FOR ME FOR WHILE SHE CONTINUED THERE I COULD NOT WRITE TO HER AS I DID NOT KNOW THE ADDRESS AND WOULD NOT ASK IT OF HIM
HE NEVER DANCED HIMSELF AND THERE HE SAT POKING HIS HEAD IN MY FACE AND IMPRESSING ALL BEHOLDERS WITH THE IDEA THAT HE WAS A CONFIRMED ACKNOWLEDGED LOVER
WHAT CAN YOU BE DRIVING AT YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL
SUCH A MODE OF ADMONITION WINS ONLY COARSE ABUSE FOR ME--AND INDEED I ALMOST FEEL AS IF I DESERVED IT FOR I HATE TO USE SUCH ARGUMENTS
BUT GIVE ME YOUR LAST OPINION AND IF YOU CAN SUGGEST ANY FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IT SHALL BE--DULY CONSIDERED AT LEAST THE PICTURE WAS STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL
CHAPTER XXIX THOSE WERE FOUR MISERABLE MONTHS ALTERNATING BETWEEN INTENSE ANXIETY DESPAIR AND INDIGNATION PITY FOR HIM AND PITY FOR MYSELF
SHE TOOK THEM AWAY AND I FOLLOWED
I LOVE HER FOR YOUR SAKE AND HER HAPPINESS SHALL BE AS DEAR TO ME AS THAT OF MY OWN MOTHER THANK YOU DARLING
SATURDAY 13TH.--THE WEEK IS OVER AND HE IS NOT COME
HE MAYN'T BE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD CALL HANDSOME BUT HE'S FAR MORE DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING AND NICER AND BETTER THAN MR HUNTINGDON;--AND I'M SURE YOU WOULD SAY SO IF YOU KNEW HIM IMPOSSIBLE MILICENT
I WISH I COULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN EITHER TRY ME THEN HELEN
MRS HUNTINGDON DID NOT LEAVE WILDFELL HALL TILL ABOVE TWO MONTHS AFTER OUR FAREWELL INTERVIEW
BUT HE IS MANIFESTLY AFRAID OF MY DISPLEASURE
AND IT'S WHAT I'M NOT USED TO
IT WAS A USELESS EXPOSURE OF MY WANT OF FAITH IN HIS WORD TO THE SERVANT
BUT LOWBOROUGH LOST AGAIN AND FELL DEAD SICK
I WAS NOT GOING TO BE BAULKED HOWEVER
OUR POOR INVALID EVIDENTLY FELT IT A HEARTLESS PROPOSITION AND WOULD HAVE FELT IT STILL MORE HEARTLESS IN ME TO ACCEDE TO IT
AND I WAS CONDEMNED TO SIT BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MR BOARHAM
AND I HAVE NO LONGER ANY FOR YOU HAL-LO
FOR HE HAD BORNE ENOUGH
THEY SAY THERE'LL BE NO MORE FUN NOW NO MORE MERRY DAYS AND GLORIOUS NIGHTS--AND ALL MY FAULT--I AM THE FIRST TO BREAK UP THE JOVIAL BAND AND OTHERS IN PURE DESPAIR WILL FOLLOW MY EXAMPLE
BUT I WON'T COMPLAIN OF THAT
SO WE LET HIM ALONE AND WENT ON WITH OUR JOLLIFICATION TILL SUDDENLY RAISING HIS HEAD HE INTERRUPTED US IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROAR OF LAUGHTER BY EXCLAIMING,--'GENTLEMEN WHERE IS ALL THIS TO END?--WILL YOU JUST TELL ME THAT NOW?--WHERE IS IT ALL TO END HE ROSE
I KNEW BY THE CONTRACTION OF HER BROW THE TIGHT COMPRESSION OF HER LIPS AND WRINGING OF HER HANDS THAT MEANTIME A VIOLENT CONFLICT BETWEEN REASON AND PASSION WAS SILENTLY PASSING WITHIN
YOU'RE SO UNFORTUNATE MR MARKHAM OBSERVED THE YOUNGER SISTER WITH ONE OF HER ARCH SIDELONG GLANCES
I TENDERLY SQUEEZED HER LITTLE HAND AT PARTING
CHAPTER XXXVI DECEMBER 20TH 1824.--THIS IS THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF OUR FELICITOUS UNION
AND REMEMBER YOUR SITUATION DEAREST HELEN
AND WE'VE COME HOOKED ALL THE WAY AS FOND AS A PAIR OF LOVERS--AND NOW YOU'VE TAKEN HER FROM ME
WHAT HAVE I SAID RETURNED HATTERSLEY
BUT SHE WANTED TO TEASE ME
WE ARE GOING TO PARIS BUT WE CAN DROP YOU ANYWHERE BETWEEN THIS AND DOVER NO THANK YOU
AND I THINK IT WILL NOT FOR I HAVE THOUGHT DEEPLY ON MY AUNT'S ADVICE AND I SEE CLEARLY NOW THE FOLLY OF THROWING MYSELF AWAY ON ONE THAT IS UNWORTHY OF ALL THE LOVE I HAVE TO GIVE AND INCAPABLE OF RESPONDING TO THE BEST AND DEEPEST FEELINGS OF MY INMOST HEART--SO CLEARLY THAT EVEN IF I SHOULD SEE HIM AGAIN AND IF HE SHOULD REMEMBER ME AND LOVE ME STILL WHICH ALAS
I FANCY SO AT LEAST
THERE HE STOOD BEFORE ME
I WASN'T JESTING YOU WERE LAUGHING AT ALL EVENTS
NO UNLESS YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT HIM HOME I CAN'T.--YOU DON'T WANT HIM DO YOU SAID HE WITH A BROAD GRIN
HE ASSURED ME IT WAS ALL RUBBISH AND EXHORTED ME WITH HIS DYING BREATH TO CONTINUE IN THE GOOD OLD WAY TO FOLLOW HIS STEPS AND THOSE OF HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM AND LET MY HIGHEST AMBITION BE TO WALK HONESTLY THROUGH THE WORLD LOOKING NEITHER TO THE RIGHT HAND NOR TO THE LEFT AND TO TRANSMIT THE PATERNAL ACRES TO MY CHILDREN IN AT LEAST AS FLOURISHING A CONDITION AS HE LEFT THEM TO ME
AND IN MANY OF THE ENCLOSURES RAGWEEDS AND RUSHES USURPED SUPREMACY OVER THE SCANTY HERBAGE
I SAW HIS ANGUISH AS SUDDENLY SMITING HIS FOREHEAD HE TURNED ABRUPTLY TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKING UPWARD AT THE PLACID SKY MURMURED PASSIONATELY O GOD THAT I MIGHT DIE!'--AND FELT THAT TO ADD ONE DROP OF BITTERNESS TO THAT ALREADY OVERFLOWING CUP WOULD BE UNGENEROUS INDEED
AT LEAST SAID SHE I KNOW THE VALUE OF A WARM HEART AND A BOLD MANLY SPIRIT WELL ANNABELLA SAID HE IN A DEEP AND HOLLOW TONE SINCE MY PRESENCE IS DISAGREEABLE TO YOU I WILL RELIEVE YOU OF IT ARE YOU GOING BACK TO THEM THEN SAID SHE CARELESSLY
RUN ANNABELLA RUN
I MRS MARKHAM SAID HE
BUT I DID NOT TALK MUCH TO HER
I CONSIDER THIS AN APT ILLUSTRATION OF HEAVEN TAKEN BY STORM SAID HE AS I HANDED ONE TO HIM
AND THEREFORE IT IS LIKELY TO ENTAIL A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE ON THE POSSESSOR HAVE YOU BEEN TROUBLED IN THAT WAY AUNT NO HELEN SAID SHE WITH REPROACHFUL GRAVITY BUT I KNOW MANY THAT HAVE
DON'T YOU FEEL THAT EVERY INTERVIEW MAKES US DEARER TO EACH OTHER THAN THE LAST THE UTTERANCE OF THIS LAST QUESTION WAS HURRIED AND LOW AND THE DOWNCAST EYES AND BURNING BLUSH TOO PLAINLY SHOWED THAT SHE AT LEAST HAD FELT IT
THEREUPON MR HUNTINGDON GATHERING HIS COAT-LAPS UNDER HIS ARMS AND SETTING HIS SHOULDER AGAINST THE MANTEL-PIECE TURNED TO ME AND ADDRESSING ME IN A LOW VOICE SCARCELY ABOVE HIS BREATH POURED FORTH A VOLLEY OF THE VILEST AND GROSSEST ABUSE IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE IMAGINATION TO CONCEIVE OR THE TONGUE TO UTTER
HIS SIGHS AND INTIMATIONS OF SUPPRESSED AFFLICTION SEEMED TO COME FROM A FULL HEART
WHY CAN'T YOU BE GENTLE AND GOOD AS YOU WERE LAST TIME?--I'M SURE I WAS VERY GRATEFUL FOR IT AND WHAT GOOD DID YOUR GRATITUDE DO
BUT ALREADY IN 1841 WHEN WE FIRST HEAR OF THE GONDALS AND SOLALA VERNON THE MATERIAL FOR QUITE OTHER BOOKS WAS IN POOR ANNE'S MIND
WITH TOUCHING GENEROSITY SHE MODESTLY OFFERED TO AID ME WITH HER LITTLE HOARD OF SAVINGS HOPING I WOULD EXCUSE HER FOR THE LIBERTY BUT REALLY IF I WOULD DO HER THE FAVOUR TO ACCEPT IT AS A LOAN SHE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY OF COURSE I COULD NOT THINK OF SUCH A THING
YOU MUST KNOW WHAT I THINK OF YOU WELL IF YOU WILL BE SO BITTER AGAINST ME REPLIED SHE I CAN'T HELP IT
THEN I BROUGHT HER SOME PLANTS FOR HER GARDEN IN MY SISTER'S NAME--HAVING PREVIOUSLY PERSUADED ROSE TO SEND THEM
PEOPLE SAY HE'S HANDSOME AND OF COURSE HE IS
MY POOR MOTHER WAS QUITE DISTRESSED ABOUT ME
AND THE MOMENT HE WAS GONE I BREATHED AGAIN AND FELT MY VITAL ENERGY RETURN
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THEM A BIT THIS MORNING
COME HERE MILLY AND TELL ME WHY YOU CAN'T BE SATISFIED WITH MY ASSURANCE SHE WENT AND PUTTING HER LITTLE HAND WITHIN HIS ARM LOOKED UP IN HIS FACE AND SAID SOFTLY WHAT DOES IT AMOUNT TO RALPH
MEANTIME HOWEVER I COULD NOT BUT BE ANXIOUS FOR THE RESULT OF HIS DECREES
AND YET IT WAS NOT WHOLLY SLEEPLESS
WHAT CAN INDUCE YOU TO COME SO SOON EXCLAIMED HIS LADY WITH A MOST UNGRACIOUS AIR OF DISSATISFACTION
A SLIGHT BOW WAS ALL THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM ON HIS ENTRANCE
THAT GENTLEMAN CAME AS HE SAID TO BEG A HOLIDAY FOR ME THAT I MIGHT HAVE A RUN IN THE PARK THIS FINE FROSTY MORNING WITH MILICENT AND ESTHER AND LITTLE ARTHUR WHOM HE HAD DRIVEN OVER TO SEE ME
AND HER FACE BRIGHTENED
HE TOOK IT AND HELD THE FLAME TO HATTERSLEY'S HANDS TILL ROARING LIKE A WILD BEAST THE LATTER UNCLASPED THEM AND LET HIM GO
I AM IN NO STATE TO BEAR YOUR BRUTALITIES NOW OR YOUR PRESENCE EITHER AND IN TRUTH THE MOISTURE STARTED FROM HIS PORES AND STOOD ON HIS PALE FOREHEAD LIKE DEW
I FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO
IF THERE BE REALLY LIFE BEYOND THE TOMB AND JUDGMENT AFTER DEATH HOW CAN I FACE IT?"--I CANNOT DO HIM ANY GOOD
IT IS A QUESTION OF LIFE AND DEATH SHE WAS SILENT
AT LENGTH A WELCOME YES DREW FROM ME THE SECOND QUESTION
BUT HE MANAGED TO APPEAR SO CALM AND EASY SO RESPECTFUL AND SELF-POSSESSED IN HIS FRIENDLINESS THAT THOUGH A LITTLE SURPRISED I WAS NEITHER ALARMED NOR OFFENDED AT THE UNUSUAL LIBERTY AND HE WALKED WITH ME UNDER THE ASH-TREES AND BY THE WATER-SIDE AND TALKED WITH CONSIDERABLE ANIMATION GOOD TASTE AND INTELLIGENCE ON MANY SUBJECTS BEFORE I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT GETTING RID OF HIM
AND A FEW DAYS AFTER I HEARD THAT HE HAD DEPARTED FOR LONDON
I AM DISOBEDIENT AND UNGRATEFUL
WHAT DO YOU SAY
SO IF YOU'VE ANY BUT IT MUST COME SOME TIME INTERRUPTED I AND IF IT BE YEARS HENCE IT WILL AS CERTAINLY OVERTAKE YOU AS IF IT CAME TO-DAY,--AND NO DOUBT BE AS UNWELCOME THEN AS NOW UNLESS YOU OH HANG IT
I INSTANTLY STARTED A NEW TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AND SOON TOOK LEAVE OF MY COMPANION WITH A FEELING OF LESS CORDIALITY TOWARDS HIM THAN USUAL
THE LARK WAS REJOICING AMONG THE SILVERY FLOATING CLOUDS
MRS WILSON WAS MORE BRILLIANT THAN EVER WITH HER BUDGETS OF FRESH NEWS AND OLD SCANDAL STRUNG TOGETHER WITH TRIVIAL QUESTIONS AND REMARKS AND OFT-REPEATED OBSERVATIONS UTTERED APPARENTLY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF DENYING A MOMENT'S REST TO HER INEXHAUSTIBLE ORGANS OF SPEECH
TO TELL YOU ALL THE QUESTIONINGS AND CONJECTURES--THE FEARS AND HOPES AND WILD EMOTIONS THAT JOSTLED AND CHASED EACH OTHER THROUGH MY MIND AS I DESCENDED THE HILL WOULD ALMOST FILL A VOLUME IN ITSELF
BESIDES SHE MAY KEEP UP THE DECEPTION TO THE END OF THE CHAPTER
BUT WHEN I DISMOUNTED THE GALLANT HORSEMAN AND RESTORED HIM TO HIS MOTHER SHE SEEMED RATHER DISPLEASED AT MY KEEPING HIM SO LONG
NO JESTS AND LITTLE LAUGHTER HAD ESCAPED HER LIPS
THE LANE CONDUCTED US ROUND BY THE BACK WAY
BUT NOW THANK HEAVEN I HAVE GATHERED A LITTLE HOARD OF MY OWN AND MY PREPARATIONS ARE SO FAR ADVANCED THAT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO A SPEEDY EMANCIPATION
IF YOU LIKED TO ACCEPT MR BOARHAM'S OBLIGING OFFER YOU DID HE SAY OBLIGING OFFER NO
HE SEES ME SUFFERING UNDER THE CONDESCENDING ATTENTIONS AND PROSAIC DISCOURSES OF THE ONE AND THE REPULSIVE OBTRUSIONS OF THE OTHER WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A SHADOW OF COMMISERATION FOR ME OR RESENTMENT AGAINST MY TORMENTORS
IN THE ANTE-ROOM WAS MR HATTERSLEY RAILING AGAINST LORD LOWBOROUGH'S POLTROONERY BEFORE A SELECT AUDIENCE VIZ
MR MARKHAM I SCARCELY EXPECTED THIS HE SAID
THE FIELDS BEING ROUGH AND STONY AND WHOLLY UNFIT FOR THE PLOUGH WERE MOSTLY DEVOTED TO THE POSTURING OF SHEEP AND CATTLE
IT HAS MADE ME LIKE ARTHUR A GREAT DEAL BETTER AND MADE HIM BEHAVE A GREAT DEAL BETTER TO ME
I WANT NO TENDER MESSAGES BUT JUST ASK HER THAT AND TELL HER IT IS THE GREATEST FAVOUR SHE COULD DO ME
I SHALL TAKE NO PART IN YOUR RUDE SPORTS REPLIED THE LADY COLDLY DRAWING BACK
HE SEIZED MY HAND BETWEEN BOTH HIS AND SMILINGLY DREW ME FORWARD
MY FAIR FRIEND WAS EVIDENTLY UNWILLING TO BID ME ADIEU
BUT I COULD NOT HELP THINKING ABOUT THE COST OF IT ALL THE TIME
I MUST HAVE A WRITTEN AGREEMENT AND YOU MUST SIGN IT IN PRESENCE OF A WITNESS
I HAD ALREADY REDUCED THE BOY TO LITTLE BETTER THAN AN AUTOMATON
MAMMA SAYS YOU'RE TO COME IN MR MARKHAM SAID HE AND I AM TO GO OUT AND PLAY WITH ROVER RACHEL RETIRED WITH A SIGH AND I STEPPED INTO THE PARLOUR AND SHUT THE DOOR
AS SOON AS THE COLOSSAL PERSON OF HER FATHER DARKENED THE DOOR SHE UTTERED A SHRILL SCREAM OF DELIGHT AND QUITTING HER MOTHER'S SIDE RAN CROWING TOWARDS HIM BALANCING HER COURSE WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS AND EMBRACING HIS KNEE THREW BACK HER HEAD AND LAUGHED IN HIS FACE
THE CHILD THOUGH SHY WAS NOT SULLEN
THEN WHY HAVE YOU ACCEPTED HIM YOU WILL ASK
HE SEEMED BENT UPON DISPLAYING ME TO HIS FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES IN PARTICULAR AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL ON EVERY POSSIBLE OCCASION AND TO THE GREATEST POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE
BUT MY MOTHER HAD KINDLY KEPT THE TEAPOT AND MUFFIN WARM UPON THE HOBS AND THOUGH SHE SCOLDED ME A LITTLE READILY ADMITTED MY EXCUSES
POOH POOH
AT THE SAME MOMENT BRANWELL WAS SUMMARILY DISMISSED FROM HIS TUTORSHIP HIS EMPLOYER MR ROBINSON WRITING A STERN LETTER OF COMPLAINT TO BRAMWELL'S FATHER CONCERNED NO DOUBT WITH THE YOUNG MAN'S DISORDERLY AND INTEMPERATE HABITS
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HE SAYS
I SUPPOSE SHE DOESN'T MIND IT I CAN ENLIGHTEN YOU ON THAT SUBJECT MR HATTERSLEY SAID I
YOUR FAIR FAME IS GONE
BUT I HAVE YOU KNOW RETURNED HE WITH PECULIAR EMPHASIS
BUT I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE ALL THE BLOOD IN YOUR BODY--I'LL JUST CONDESCEND TO BIND THAT UP FOR YOU LET ME ALONE IF YOU PLEASE HUMPH
I HAD MUCH TROUBLE AT FIRST IN BREAKING HIM OF THOSE EVIL HABITS HIS FATHER HAD TAUGHT HIM TO ACQUIRE BUT ALREADY THAT DIFFICULTY IS NEARLY VANQUISHED NOW
YOU WON'T MISS ME MUCH NOT THE LEAST
BUT IF YOU HAD SENT ME A MESSAGE THROUGH YOUR BROTHER OR EVEN ASKED HIM ABOUT ME NOW AND THEN I DID ASK ABOUT YOU FREQUENTLY
I SUPPOSE SIR BUT I TURNED AND LEFT HIM WITHOUT WAITING TO HEAR WHAT HE SUPPOSED
IT WAS A YOUNGER SLIGHTER ROSIER BEAUTY--LOVELY INDEED BUT WITH FAR LESS DIGNITY AND DEPTH OF SOUL--WITHOUT THAT INDEFINABLE GRACE THAT KEENLY SPIRITUAL YET GENTLE CHARM THAT INEFFABLE POWER TO ATTRACT AND SUBJUGATE THE HEART--MY HEART AT LEAST
THEN HE CLASPED HIS HANDS BEFORE HIS EYES TO SHUT OUT THE SIGHT AND TWO MINUTES AFTER LIFTED HIS HEAD AGAIN AND SAID IN A HOARSE BUT VEHEMENT WHISPER AND YET I MUST
BUT I KEPT ALOOF FROM THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND STILL CONTINUED MY LABOUR AND HAVE CONTINUED IT WITH ALMOST UNABATED ARDOUR TO THE PRESENT DAY
BY MAKING A FIGURE IN THE WORLD AND SHOWING THEM OFF TO ADVANTAGE SHE HOPES TO OBTAIN BETTER CHANCES FOR THEM
BUT IT WAS EVIDENT HIS CURIOSITY WAS TOO KEENLY EXCITED TO BE QUENCHED BY THAT AND THE MORE I MANIFESTED MY ANXIETY TO BAFFLE HIS SCRUTINY THE GREATER WOULD BE HIS DETERMINATION TO PERSIST IN IT BESIDES IT WAS TOO LATE
FOR I SEE THAT EVERYBODY LIKES HIM AND ALL THE MAMMAS SMILE UPON HIM AND THEIR DAUGHTERS--AND MISS WILMOT HERSELF--ARE ONLY TOO GLAD TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION HELEN THE WORLD MAY LOOK UPON SUCH OFFENCES AS VENIAL
THEY STILL CONTINUED TO LIVE AT THE VICARAGE THE LADY DIVIDING HER TIME BETWEEN HER FATHER HER HUSBAND AND THEIR POOR PARISHIONERS,--AND SUBSEQUENTLY HER RISING FAMILY
BUT THIS TIME ARTHUR I ADDED EARNESTLY SHOW ME THAT YOU CAN AND TEACH ME THAT I NEED NOT FEAR TO TRUST YOU HE PROMISED FAIR BUT IN SUCH A MANNER AS WE SEEK TO SOOTHE A CHILD
HE NEVER ATTEMPTED TO HELP ME TILL HE SAW MR BOARHAM COMING TO DO SO
AND MRS GRAHAM SAID HE AGAIN FIVE MINUTES AFTER WE WERE DISPUTING AS WE CAME ALONG A QUESTION THAT YOU CAN READILY DECIDE FOR US AS IT MAINLY REGARDED YOURSELF--AND INDEED WE OFTEN HOLD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT YOU
FOR THERE WAS FAR MORE CAREFUL MINUTENESS OF DETAIL AND LESS OF THAT FRESHNESS OF COLOURING AND FREEDOM OF HANDLING THAT DELIGHTED AND SURPRISED ME IN THEM
ISN'T HE HANDSOME NOW HELEN WHISPERED MILICENT HER SISTERLY PRIDE OVERCOMING FOR THE MOMENT ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
AND HOW ASKED HE EAGERLY
I'M NOT SO OLD BUT WHAT I CAN STAND HARD FARE AND HARD WORK IF IT'S ONLY TO HELP AND COMFORT THEM AS I'VE LOVED LIKE MY OWN BAIRNS
SHE HAD VERY FINE EYES BY-THE-BY--I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE BUT THEY WERE FULL OF SOUL LARGE CLEAR AND NEARLY BLACK--NOT BROWN BUT VERY DARK GREY
NOT ENTIRELY BANISHED ME FROM HER MIND
BUT PERHAPS IT WAS INTENDED FOR ME NO
AND IT WAS NOT TILL ARTHUR HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME GENTLY PULLING MY COAT AND REPEATING HIS INVITATIONS TO ENTER THAT I AT LENGTH CONSENTED TO ACCOMPANY HIM INTO THE APARTMENT WHERE THE LADIES AWAITED US
I HAVE KNOWN SOME SENSIBLE PERSONS GREAT ADEPTS IN THAT STYLE OF CONVERSATION WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES IMPELLED THEM TO IT
GREATLY WRONGED HIM THEY HAVE CRIED I--'AND THEY SHALL WRONG HIM NO MORE--HIS WIFE SHALL UNDO WHAT HIS MOTHER DID WELL SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT PAUSE I MUST SAY HELEN I THOUGHT BETTER OF YOUR JUDGMENT THAN THIS--AND YOUR TASTE TOO
I WONDER IF SHE WAS EVER IN LOVE
WHAT DID I NOT OWE TO YOU FOR THIS AND EVERY OTHER HAPPY MEETING
WHEN WE DID MEET IT WAS HE THAT SOUGHT ME OUT
I TAKE NO PLEASURE IN WATCHING PEOPLE PASS THE WINDOWS
WELL BUT YOU MIGHT STAY WITH THEM A LITTLE
SHE MIGHT HAVE FAR WORSE TO SUFFER THAN I FOR I AM REALLY CONTENTED HELEN THOUGH YOU MAYN'T THINK IT
AFTER BRIEFLY ANSWERING HIS SALUTATION AND INQUIRING AFTER THE LADIES AT THE GROVE I TURNED AWAY AND WALKED ON
DON'T ABUSE HER ANY MORE AND SET YOUR MIND AT REST
THEN WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOME TRIFLING SELF-CONCEITED GIRL LIKE ELIZA MILLWARD CARELESS OF EVERYTHING BUT HER OWN IMMEDIATE PLEASURE AND ADVANTAGE OR SOME MISGUIDED OBSTINATE WOMAN LIKE MRS GRAHAM IGNORANT OF HER PRINCIPAL DUTIES AND CLEVER ONLY IN WHAT CONCERNS HER LEAST TO KNOW--THEN YOU'LL FIND THE DIFFERENCE IT WILL DO ME GOOD MOTHER
WHEN A BOY HAS BEEN EATING RAISINS AND SUGAR-PLUMS ALL DAY HE LONGS FOR A SQUEEZE OF SOUR ORANGE BY WAY OF A CHANGE
BUT I HAD LEARNT AT LAST TO DISREGARD HIS PROMISES
SHE DOES NOT LOVE HIM
ONLY I THINK TOO MUCH OF IT DOESN'T ANSWER FOR ANY MAN WELL I WOULD NEVER CONTRADICT YOU WITHOUT A CAUSE BUT CERTAINLY I WOULD ALWAYS LET YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT OF YOUR CONDUCT
AND I KNOW THAT SPRING IS APPROACHING AND DEEPLY DREAD THE CONSEQUENCES
BUT I CONTINUED SILENT
AND THERE WAS NO MORE COACHING NOR ANY CONVEYANCE TO BE HAD EXCEPT A COMMON CART AND THAT WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY FOR HALF THE TOWN WAS IN BED
MY DUTY OF COURSE,--BUT HOW
AND SHE HAS DUPED ME ALL THIS TIME HE TURNED AWAY WITH A SUPPRESSED GROAN OF AGONY AND PACED THE ROOM AGAIN IN A PAROXYSM OF RENEWED AGITATION
AND WHILE HIS ANTAGONIST SMILINGLY SWEPT AWAY THE STAKES HE TURNED CHALKY WHITE DREW BACK IN SILENCE AND WIPED HIS FOREHEAD
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT SAID LAWRENCE AS I SILENTLY REFOLDED THE LETTER
THIS IS NO JEST ARTHUR SAID I SERIOUSLY BUT AS CALMLY AS I COULD--'UNLESS YOU THINK IT A JEST TO LOSE MY AFFECTION FOR EVER WHAT
I WAS NOT AWARE THAT YOU WERE ON SUCH INTIMATE TERMS WITH MR LAWRENCE'S HOUSEHOLD IT WAS NOT FROM THE MAN HIMSELF THAT I HEARD IT BUT HE TOLD IT IN CONFIDENCE TO OUR MAID SARAH AND SARAH TOLD IT TO ME IN CONFIDENCE I SUPPOSE
I HAVE SEVERAL LETTERS FROM HER EXPRESSING THE GREATEST ANXIETY ABOUT HIS PROCEEDINGS AND COMPLAINING THAT YOU INCITE HIM TO COMMIT THOSE EXTRAVAGANCES--ONE ESPECIALLY IN WHICH SHE IMPLORES ME TO USE MY INFLUENCE WITH YOU TO GET YOU AWAY FROM LONDON AND AFFIRMS THAT HER HUSBAND NEVER DID SUCH THINGS BEFORE YOU CAME AND WOULD CERTAINLY DISCONTINUE THEM AS SOON AS YOU DEPARTED AND LEFT HIM TO THE GUIDANCE OF HIS OWN GOOD SENSE THE DETESTABLE LITTLE TRAITOR
YOU WOULD HAVE HER TO BE TENDERLY AND DELICATELY NURTURED LIKE A HOT-HOUSE PLANT--TAUGHT TO CLING TO OTHERS FOR DIRECTION AND SUPPORT AND GUARDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM THE VERY KNOWLEDGE OF EVIL
AND I'M COME TO--IN SHORT TO EXPRESS MY REGRET FOR WHAT HAS BEEN DONE AND TO BEG YOUR PARDON
BUT IF DONE BY THE SAME HAND AS THE OTHERS IT WAS EVIDENTLY SOME YEARS BEFORE
I WISH MY NATURE WERE AS CALM AS YOURS MY NATURE WAS NOT ORIGINALLY CALM SAID I
I STOOD BESIDE THE CARRIAGE AND THE WINDOW BEING DOWN I SAW MY HAPPY FRIEND FONDLY ENCIRCLE HIS COMPANION'S WAIST WITH HIS ARM WHILE SHE RESTED HER GLOWING CHEEK ON HIS SHOULDER LOOKING THE VERY IMPERSONATION OF LOVING TRUSTING BLISS
INDEED AT THE TIME I KNEW NOT WHAT WAS SAID
AND THOUGH I WRITE AS IF YOU WERE SOME ABANDONED WRETCH PAST HOPE AND PAST REPRIEVE IT IS ONLY MY ANXIOUS FEARS MY STRONG DESIRES THAT MAKE ME DO SO
AND WHEN YOU HEAR SUCH WORDS SPOKEN ARTHUR REMEMBER NEVER TO REPEAT THEM
COME NOW HATTERSLEY I CAN'T ALLOW THAT SAID THAT GENTLEMAN STEPPING UP TO THE ILL-ASSORTED COUPLE
DOUBTLESS SHE HAD HEARD OR GUESSED SOMETHING OF MISS WILSON'S REMARKS AND THEREFORE IT WAS NATURAL ENOUGH SHE SHOULD CHOOSE TO CONTINUE THE TETE-A-TETE NO LONGER ESPECIALLY AS AT THAT MOMENT MY CHEEKS WERE BURNING WITH INDIGNATION AGAINST MY FORMER FRIEND THE TOKEN OF WHICH SHE MIGHT MISTAKE FOR A BLUSH OF STUPID EMBARRASSMENT
SHE WAS BLAMELESS OF COURSE BUT HE WAS DETESTABLE BEYOND ALL COUNT
SHE LET ME HOLD IT FOR A MOMENT AND I SAW A FLASH OF ECSTATIC BRILLIANCE IN HER EYE A GLOW OF GLAD EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE--I THOUGHT MY HOUR OF VICTORY WAS COME--BUT INSTANTLY A PAINFUL RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO FLASH UPON HER
THE PASSENGERS CONFOUNDEDLY APATHETIC IN THEIR SUPINE INDIFFERENCE TO THE RATE OF OUR PROGRESSION
I SUPPOSE IT IS NO USE ASKING YOU TO FIX A DAY FOR YOUR RETURN SAID I
I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT SO ONCE BUT NOW I SAY GIVE ME THE GIRL I LOVE AND I WILL SWEAR ETERNAL CONSTANCY TO HER AND HER ALONE THROUGH SUMMER AND WINTER THROUGH YOUTH AND AGE AND LIFE AND DEATH
OF COURSE I WAS VEXED AT ALL THIS
FOR WHAT COULD HAVE BROUGHT ME HITHER BUT THE HOPE OF REVIVING HER ATTACHMENT WITH A VIEW HEREAFTER TO OBTAIN HER HAND
I SNATCHED HER HAND AND WOULD HAVE FERVENTLY KISSED IT BUT SUDDENLY CHECKED MYSELF AND SAID BUT HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE CONSEQUENCES HARDLY I THINK OR I SHOULD NOT HAVE OFFERED MYSELF TO ONE TOO PROUD TO TAKE ME OR TOO INDIFFERENT TO MAKE HIS AFFECTION OUTWEIGH MY WORLDLY GOODS STUPID BLOCKHEAD THAT I WAS!--I TREMBLED TO CLASP HER IN MY ARMS BUT DARED NOT BELIEVE IN SO MUCH JOY AND YET RESTRAINED MYSELF TO SAY BUT IF YOU SHOULD REPENT IT WOULD BE YOUR FAULT SHE REPLIED
IF I HAD BUT KNOWN HER BEFORE HOW MUCH DEGRADATION AND MISERY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPARED
FEBRUARY HOWEVER WAS APPROACHING
BUT WHAT TROUBLE I HAVE HAD THROUGHOUT THESE TWO DAYS STRUGGLING TO APPEAR CALM AND COLLECTED TO MEET HIM AND HER AS USUAL WHEN I WAS OBLIGED TO MEET THEM AND FORCING MYSELF TO LEAVE MY LITTLE ARTHUR IN HER HANDS FOR HOURS TOGETHER
WOULD YOU THINK I LOVED YOU IF I DID SO
AND I GAVE A SKETCH OF HIS GENERAL CONDUCT AND A MORE PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF HIS BEHAVIOUR WITH REGARD TO HIS CHILD AND EXPLAINED MY APPREHENSIONS ON THE LATTER'S ACCOUNT AND MY DETERMINATION TO DELIVER HIM FROM HIS FATHER'S INFLUENCE
HE WAS JUST PUTTING LITTLE HAND ON THE DOG'S NECK AND BEGINNING TO SMILE THROUGH HIS TEARS WHEN I HEARD BEHIND ME A CLICK OF THE IRON GATE AND A RUSTLE OF FEMALE GARMENTS AND LO
I PASSED HALF THE DAY IN HIS ROOM AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS
SOMETIMES QUIETLY WITH HIS PALE FACE UPTURNED TO MINE
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ALL THIS TIME YOU'D BETTER NOT ASK SAID HE WITH A FAINT SMILE
A DEPLORABLE SPECTACLE INDEED
SULLEN SILENCE WAS TAKEN FOR RAPT ATTENTION AND GAVE HIM GREATER ROOM TO TALK
FOR I WAS VEXED TO FEEL THE COLOUR MOUNTING TO MY FOREHEAD DESPITE MY STRENUOUS EFFORTS TO APPEAR UNMOVED
BUT I WISH YOU COULD HAVE GOT RALPH TO COME TOO UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE DEAR MILICENT REPLIED HE GAILY
I HAVE NO WISH TO PUBLISH YOUR SHAME
SHE KNOWS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD FORGET HER
GIVE ME THE RIGHT TO IDENTIFY YOUR HONOUR WITH MY OWN AND TO DEFEND YOUR REPUTATION AS MORE PRECIOUS THAN MY LIFE ARE YOU HERO ENOUGH TO UNITE YOURSELF TO ONE WHOM YOU KNOW TO BE SUSPECTED AND DESPISED BY ALL AROUND YOU AND IDENTIFY YOUR INTERESTS AND YOUR HONOUR WITH HERS
I OFFERED NO REPLY HOWEVER BUT PUSHED ASIDE THE CURTAIN AND LOOKED INTO THE NIGHT--OR RATHER INTO THE LAMP-LIT SQUARE
OTHERWISE HALFORD YOU COULD NEVER HAVE BECOME SO THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH ITS CONTENTS
HE APPEARED GRIEVED AND HURT AT MY UNKIND RECEPTION OF HIS SYMPATHISING OVERTURES
AND THAT HE NEED NOT TROUBLE HIMSELF TO BARGAIN FOR THE CHILD FOR HE FREDERICK FANCIED HE KNEW ENOUGH OF HIS SISTER TO ENABLE HIM TO DECLARE THAT WHEREVER SHE MIGHT BE OR HOWEVER SITUATED NO CONSIDERATION WOULD INDUCE HER TO DELIVER HIM UP
YOU RECEIVED MY LETTER WHAT LETTER THE ONE ANNOUNCING MY INTENDED MARRIAGE I NEVER RECEIVED THE MOST DISTANT HINT OF SUCH AN INTENTION IT MUST HAVE CROSSED YOU ON YOUR WAY THEN--IT SHOULD HAVE REACHED YOU YESTERDAY MORNING--IT WAS RATHER LATE I ACKNOWLEDGE
I AM FULLY ALIVE TO THE EVILS THAT MAY AND MUST RESULT UPON THE STEP I AM ABOUT TO TAKE
THE GENTLEMEN AND LADY LOWBOROUGH WERE INVITED FOR THE PLEASURE AND CONVENIENCE OF THE HOST
I SHOULD BE SORRY TO STAND BETWEEN ANY MAN--OR BODY OF MEN AND SO MUCH HAPPINESS
AND FOR YOU I WISH YOU WERE AS WELL CONTENT WITH YOUR INTENDED AS I AM WITH MINE SAID I
BUT IT IS A GIFT I CANNOT BOAST THE POSSESSION OF
NO REPLIED I AND NEVER WILL BE SO AGAIN I TRUST YOU GAVE HIM A CURTAIN LECTURE DID YOU NO
YOU WILL GO TO HER LAWRENCE SAID I AS I PUT THE LETTER INTO HIS HAND
ANOTHER VIEW OF THE OLD HALL BASKING IN THE SUNNY HAZE OF A QUIET SUMMER AFTERNOON
AND AS FOR THE MISTAKE I AM SORRY FOR BOTH OUR SAKES THAT IT SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED
NO SHOULD YOU WISH YOUR DAUGHTER TO DESPISE YOU--OR AT LEAST TO FEEL NO VESTIGE OF RESPECT FOR YOU AND NO AFFECTION BUT WHAT IS MINGLED WITH THE BITTEREST REGRET OH NO
BUT I COMPLIED AND FOLLOWED HER INTO THE LIBRARY
THE LATTER WAS FULL OF HOPE AND JOY YET WITH A TREMBLING CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THIS HAPPINESS WOULD NOT LAST
AND DON'T BE SO VERY--I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT--INACCESSIBLE AS YOU ARE.--I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF JANE WILSON
GO BACK TO YOUR FIELDS AND YOUR CATTLE YOU LUBBERLY FELLOW
THEY ENCOURAGE HIM DAILY TO OVERSTEP THE BOUNDS OF MODERATION AND NOT UNFREQUENTLY TO DISGRACE HIMSELF BY POSITIVE EXCESS
BUT FIVE MINUTES AFTER IN LOOKING FROM MY WINDOW I BEHELD MR BOARHAM COMING UP TO THE DOOR
THEN FOLLOWED EIGHT OR TEN MINUTES OF SILENCE DURING THE GREATER PART OF WHICH I BELIEVE HE WAS STARING AT ME
THERE ARE MANY MANY OTHER THINGS TO BE CONSIDERED
VERY FINE LAND IF YOU SAW IT IN THE SUMMER OR SPRING AY RESPONDED THE OTHER A GRUFF ELDERLY MAN WITH A DRAB GREATCOAT BUTTONED UP TO THE CHIN AND A COTTON UMBRELLA BETWEEN HIS KNEES
BUT HELEN I BEGAN IN A SOFT LOW TONE NOT DARING TO RAISE MY EYES TO HER FACE THAT MAN IS NOT YOUR HUSBAND
LEAVING THEM BUSY AT WORK ON THE SIDE OF THE VALLEY I ASCENDED THE HILL INTENDING TO VISIT A CORN-FIELD IN THE MORE ELEVATED REGIONS AND SEE WHEN IT WOULD BE RIPE FOR THE SICKLE
PERHAPS TOO I WAS A LITTLE BIT SPOILED BY MY MOTHER AND SISTER AND SOME OTHER LADIES OF MY ACQUAINTANCE;--AND YET I WAS BY NO MEANS A FOP--OF THAT I AM FULLY CONVINCED WHETHER YOU ARE OR NOT
A HAND GENTLY TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND A VOICE SAID SOFTLY,--'HELEN WHAT IS THE MATTER I COULD NOT ANSWER AT THE MOMENT
I ALWAYS SAID AND THOUGHT THAT I WOULD NEVER BELIEVE A WORD AGAINST YOU UNLESS I HEARD IT FROM YOUR OWN LIPS
ESSENTIALLY OF RESERVED HABITS AND BUT SELDOM QUITTING THE SECLUDED PLACE OF HIS BIRTH WHERE HE HAD LIVED IN SOLITARY STATE SINCE THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER HE HAD NEITHER THE OPPORTUNITY NOR THE INCLINATION FOR FORMING MANY ACQUAINTANCES
IT HAD BEEN GRADUALLY INCREASING UPON HIM EVER SINCE WE CAME TO TOWN
AND BESIDES IF I HAD WHOLLY KEPT AWAY THE VICAR WHO LOOKED UPON MY VISITS AS PAID CHIEFLY IF NOT ENTIRELY TO HIMSELF WOULD HAVE FELT HIMSELF DECIDEDLY AFFRONTED BY THE NEGLECT
THE CHILD'S EDUCATION WAS THE ONLY PLEASURE AND BUSINESS OF MY LIFE
AND THERE I BEHELD A TALL LADY-LIKE FIGURE CLAD IN BLACK
AND SOME OTHER THINGS SHE MINDS STILL MORE WHICH YET YOU MAY NEVER HEAR HER COMPLAIN OF HOW DO YOU KNOW?--DOES SHE COMPLAIN TO YOU DEMANDED HE WITH A SUDDEN SPARK OF FURY READY TO BURST INTO A FLAME IF I SHOULD ANSWER YES NO I REPLIED
WHEN THE NOTE WAS DONE I THOUGHT IT TIME TO RETIRE AND TOOK LEAVE AFTER ASKING IF THERE WAS ANYTHING IN THE WORLD I COULD DO FOR HIM LITTLE OR GREAT IN THE WAY OF ALLEVIATING HIS SUFFERINGS AND REPAIRING THE INJURY I HAD DONE
IF THESE LITTLE CREATURES KNEW HOW GREAT A CHANGE AWAITED THEM NO DOUBT THEY WOULD REGRET IT
GONE OUT WITH LORD LOWBOROUGH ANSWERED I FOR HE LOOKED AT ME FOR A REPLY
THIS IS HELL BROTH HE EXCLAIMED
AND THAT QUICKLY FOR SHE AND MY UNCLE WOULD NO DOUBT HEAR OF IT WITHIN A DAY OR TWO AFTER MY DISAPPEARANCE AS IT WAS PROBABLE THAT MR HUNTINGDON WOULD SPEEDILY APPLY TO THEM TO KNOW WHAT WAS BECOME OF ME
IS HE OFTEN SO MY BLOOD BOILED IN MY FACE
YOU HAVE OFFERED TO TELL
WHETHER MR HARGRAVE DIVINED MY THOUGHTS I CANNOT TELL BUT WITH A HALF-HESITATING SYMPATHISING SERIOUSNESS OF TONE AND MANNER HE ASKED IF I HAD LATELY HEARD FROM MR HUNTINGDON
TO MY THINKING A WOMAN'S RELIGION OUGHT NOT TO LESSEN HER DEVOTION TO HER EARTHLY LORD
AND YOU HELEN
IT WAS EVIDENT THEN THAT FOR MRS GRAHAM'S SAKE IT WAS NOT HIS INTENTION TO CRIMINATE ME
AND ON THE WAY MORALLY STARTED TO FIND MYSELF THINKING THAT AFTER ALL IT WOULD PERHAPS BE BETTER TO SPEND ONE'S DAYS WITH SUCH A WOMAN THAN WITH ELIZA MILLWARD
I DELUDED MYSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT YOU WERE ASHAMED OF YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS AND HOPED YOU WOULD NEVER REPEAT THEM AGAIN
AT LENGTH MR HUNTINGDON TURNED TO ME AND ADDRESSING ME IN A CONFIDENTIAL WHISPER SAID,--'HELEN WHY DID YOU BURN MY PICTURE BECAUSE I WISHED TO DESTROY IT I ANSWERED WITH AN ASPERITY IT IS USELESS NOW TO LAMENT
THEY SAY SHE BEGINS ALREADY TO SEE AT HE ISN'T NOT ALTOGETHER THAT NICE GENEROUS PERLITE DELIGHTFUL GENTLEMAN AT SHE THOUGHT HIM AFORE MARRIAGE--HE BEGINS A BEING CARELESS AND MASTERFUL ALREADY
BUT THAT WORD REFUGE DISTURBED ME
BUT IS IT NOT TIME TO DELIVER HIM FROM SUCH A PARENT
WELL LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THEM AND REGARDLESS OF MISS HARGRAVE'S PROTESTATIONS THAT THEY WERE NOT WORTH LOOKING AT HE DREW A CHAIR TO MY SIDE AND RECEIVING THE DRAWINGS ONE BY ONE FROM MY HAND SUCCESSIVELY SCANNED THEM OVER AND THREW THEM ON THE TABLE BUT SAID NOT A WORD ABOUT THEM THOUGH HE WAS TALKING ALL THE TIME
I AM NOT WELL FITTED TO BE HIS ONLY COMPANION I KNOW
DO NOT BE ALARMED HE ADDED FOR MY FACE WAS CRIMSON WITH ANGER
BUT NOT DISPOSED TO TALK TO HIM I BROKE INTO A GALLOP
DID YOU NOT TELL MR HUNTINGDON YOU MUST HAVE ONE THAT WOULD SUBMIT TO ANYTHING WITHOUT A MURMUR AND NEVER BLAME YOU WHATEVER YOU DID TRUE BUT WE SHOULDN'T ALWAYS HAVE WHAT WE WANT
I HATE TALKING WHERE THERE IS NO EXCHANGE OF IDEAS OR SENTIMENTS AND NO GOOD GIVEN OR RECEIVED WELL SAID I IF EVER I TROUBLE YOU WITH MY LOQUACITY TELL ME SO AT ONCE AND I PROMISE NOT TO BE OFFENDED
I DID NOT LOOK AT IT
YET ANNE'S LAST LINES'--'I HOPED THAT WITH THE BRAVE AND STRONG'--HAVE SWEETNESS AND SINCERITY
IN THE DRAWING-ROOM I FOUND LADY LOWBOROUGH EVIDENTLY IN NO VERY ENVIABLE STATE OF MIND AND STRUGGLING HARD TO CONCEAL HER DISCOMPOSURE BY AN OVERSTRAINED AFFECTATION OF UNUSUAL CHEERFULNESS AND VIVACITY VERY UNCALLED-FOR UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR SHE HAD HERSELF GIVEN THE COMPANY TO UNDERSTAND THAT HER HUSBAND HAD RECEIVED UNPLEASANT INTELLIGENCE FROM HOME WHICH NECESSITATED HIS IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE AND THAT HE HAD SUFFERED IT SO TO BOTHER HIS MIND THAT IT HAD BROUGHT ON A BILIOUS HEADACHE OWING TO WHICH AND THE PREPARATIONS HE JUDGED NECESSARY TO HASTEN HIS DEPARTURE SHE BELIEVED THEY WOULD NOT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HIM TO-NIGHT
I WAS SO FEARFUL OF THIS AT FIRST THAT I HUMBLED MYSELF TO INTIMATE TO HIM IN PRIVATE MY APPREHENSIONS OF ARTHUR'S PRONENESS TO THESE EXCESSES AND TO EXPRESS A HOPE THAT HE WOULD NOT ENCOURAGE IT
THE EYES DID NOT NOTICE ME BUT SPARKLED WITH GLEE ON BEHOLDING SANCHO MY BEAUTIFUL BLACK AND WHITE SETTER THAT WAS COURSING ABOUT THE FIELD WITH ITS MUZZLE TO THE GROUND
THEN COME WITH ME INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM ARTHUR
SINE AS YE BREW MY MAIDEN FAIR KEEP MIND THAT YE MAUN DRINK THE YILL
MY MOTHER ATTEMPTED TO APPEASE HER BY AN EXPLANATION
I WONDER ELIZA YOU SHOULD THINK OF REFERRING TO THAT UNFORTUNATE PERSON--YOU MIGHT KNOW THE MENTION OF HER WOULD BE ANYTHING BUT AGREEABLE TO ANY ONE HERE PRESENT HOW COULD THIS BE BORNE
MAY I NOT KEEP IT MYSELF I ASKED
SHE KNOWS HER POWER AND SHE USES IT TOO
THIS IS THE LAST TIME I SHALL SEE YOU
MR MILLWARD WAS MIGHTY IN IMPORTANT DOGMAS AND SENTENTIOUS JOKES POMPOUS ANECDOTES AND ORACULAR DISCOURSES DEALT OUT FOR THE EDIFICATION OF THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY IN GENERAL AND OF THE ADMIRING MRS MARKHAM THE POLITE MR LAWRENCE THE SEDATE MARY MILLWARD THE QUIET RICHARD WILSON AND THE MATTER-OF-FACT ROBERT IN PARTICULAR,--AS BEING THE MOST ATTENTIVE LISTENERS
THAT'S THE RIGHT PLAN--ISN'T IT MRS H
BESIDES IT WOULD BREAK HIS HEART AND HE LAUGHED AGAIN
BUT ANNABELLA HAD THE AUDACITY TO COME AND PLACE HERSELF BESIDE ME AND EVEN TO PUT HER HAND UPON MY SHOULDER AND SAY SOFTLY YOU NEED NOT GRUDGE HIM TO ME HELEN FOR I LOVE HIM MORE THAN EVER YOU COULD DO THIS PUT ME BESIDE MYSELF
BUT THE BITTERNESS OF HIS SELF-CONDEMNATION FOR HIS INWARD FEELINGS TOWARDS THAT INNOCENT BEING HIS CONSTANT STRUGGLES TO SUBDUE THE EVIL PROMPTINGS OF HIS NATURE FOR IT WAS NOT A GENEROUS ONE THOUGH PARTLY GUESSED AT BY THOSE WHO KNEW HIM COULD BE KNOWN TO GOD AND HIS OWN HEART ALONE;--SO ALSO WAS THE HARDNESS OF HIS CONFLICTS WITH THE TEMPTATION TO RETURN TO THE VICE OF HIS YOUTH AND SEEK OBLIVION FOR PAST CALAMITIES AND DEADNESS TO THE PRESENT MISERY OF A BLIGHTED HEART A JOYLESS FRIENDLESS LIFE AND A MORBIDLY DISCONSOLATE MIND BY YIELDING AGAIN TO THAT INSIDIOUS FOE TO HEALTH AND SENSE AND VIRTUE WHICH HAD SO DEPLORABLY ENSLAVED AND DEGRADED HIM BEFORE
I HAD TAKEN THE BURDEN UPON MYSELF
SHE WAS THEN TEACHING IN THE FAMILY AT THORPE GREEN WHERE BRANWELL JOINED HER AS TUTOR IN 1843 AND WHERE OWING TO EVENTS THAT ARE STILL A MYSTERY SHE SEEMS TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH AN ORDEAL THAT LEFT HER SHATTERED IN HEALTH AND NERVE WITH NOTHING GAINED BUT THOSE MELANCHOLY AND REPULSIVE MEMORIES THAT SHE WAS AFTERWARDS TO EMBODY IN WILDFELL HALL SHE SEEMS INDEED TO HAVE BEEN PARTLY THE VICTIM OF BRANWELL'S MORBID IMAGINATION THE IMAGINATION OF AN OPIUM-EATER AND A DRUNKARD
BUT NOT AS WE ARE NOW I COULD NOT HELP REPLYING
NOT YOURS YET SAID I HASTILY SWERVING ASIDE FROM THIS TOO PRESUMPTUOUS GREETING
WHILE THE BRIGHT CHESTNUT HAIR CLUSTERING IN ABUNDANT WAVY CURLS TRESPASSED TOO MUCH UPON THE FOREHEAD AND SEEMED TO INTIMATE THAT THE OWNER THEREOF WAS PROUDER OF HIS BEAUTY THAN HIS INTELLECT--AS PERHAPS HE HAD REASON TO BE
THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT BRANWELL'S CONDUCT WAS RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR EMILY'S ILLNESS AND DEATH AND ANNE IN THE CONTEMPORARY FRAGMENT RECOVERED BY MR SHORTER GIVES A LESS TRAGIC ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER
IF YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR SON TO WALK HONOURABLY THROUGH THE WORLD YOU MUST NOT ATTEMPT TO CLEAR THE STONES FROM HIS PATH BUT TEACH HIM TO WALK FIRMLY OVER THEM--NOT INSIST UPON LEADING HIM BY THE HAND BUT LET HIM LEARN TO GO ALONE I WILL LEAD HIM BY THE HAND MR MARKHAM TILL HE HAS STRENGTH TO GO ALONE
THIS MORNING'S POST BROUGHT HIM LETTERS FROM SEVERAL OF HIS FRIENDS DURING THE PERUSAL OF WHICH AT THE BREAKFAST-TABLE HE EXCITED THE ATTENTION OF THE COMPANY BY THE SINGULAR VARIETY OF HIS GRIMACES
IT IS A VERY LONG WALK TOO FAR FOR YOU AND OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR ARTHUR
STAY WITH ME HELEN HE SAYS
I TOLD HIM TO WAIT I FEAR IT WILL BE CONSIDERED AN ACT OF IMPERTINENCE SAID TO PRESUME TO LOOK AT A PICTURE THAT THE ARTIST HAS TURNED TO THE WALL
WHAT NOW THIS EXCLAMATION WAS OCCASIONED BY THE SUDDEN STOPPAGE OF THE COACH AT THE PARK-GATES
RESPECTING ME HOWEVER SHE HAD LONG SINCE SEEN HER ERROR AND PERHAPS FALLEN INTO ANOTHER IN THE OPPOSITE EXTREME
HITHERTO I HAVE STRUGGLED HARD TO HIDE YOUR VICES FROM EVERY EYE AND INVEST YOU WITH VIRTUES YOU NEVER POSSESSED
THANK HEAVEN IT IS NOT A BARREN OR A STONY SOIL
AND BY MR HUNTINGDON'S THAT HE WAS NEITHER A FOOL NOR A KNAVE THOUGH POSSIBLY NEITHER A SAGE NOR A SAINT--BUT THAT IS NO MATTER TO ME AS I AM NOT LIKELY TO MEET HIM AGAIN--UNLESS AS AN OCCASIONAL PARTNER IN THE BALL-ROOM IT WAS NOT SO HOWEVER FOR I MET HIM AGAIN NEXT MORNING
SUCH GOODNESS OVERAWES ME
I AM ANNOYED ENOUGH BY THEIR PRESENT PERSECUTIONS WITHOUT ENCOURAGING THEM FURTHER
AND HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT--SAYING SHE HAD FRIENDS OR ACQUAINTANCES FROM WHOM SHE WISHED HER PRESENT RESIDENCE TO BE CONCEALED AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF THEIR TRACING HER OUT;--AND THEN HOW SUDDENLY SHE STARTED UP AND LEFT THE ROOM WHEN THAT PERSON CAME--WHOM SHE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO LET US CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AND WHO ARTHUR WITH SUCH AN AIR OF MYSTERY TOLD US WAS HIS MAMMA'S FRIEND YES ROSE I REMEMBER IT ALL
CHAPTER XX SEPTEMBER 24TH.--IN THE MORNING I ROSE LIGHT AND CHEERFUL--NAY INTENSELY HAPPY
YOU PROMISED TO HONOUR AND OBEY ME AND NOW YOU ATTEMPT TO HECTOR OVER ME AND THREATEN AND ACCUSE ME AND CALL ME WORSE THAN A HIGHWAYMAN
TO RETURN HOWEVER TO MY OWN AFFAIRS
SHE WAS SO DEUCED IMPERIOUS AND EXACTING SAID HE
BUT IT'S SO CONFOUNDED FLAT TO BE ALWAYS CHERISHING AND PROTECTING
HIS VISIT TO THE WILSONS WAS NOT REPEATED AND THOUGH IN OUR SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEWS HE NEVER MENTIONED HER NAME TO ME NOR I TO HIM,--I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE HE PONDERED MY WORDS IN HIS MIND EAGERLY THOUGH COVERTLY SOUGHT INFORMATION RESPECTING THE FAIR LADY FROM OTHER QUARTERS SECRETLY COMPARED MY CHARACTER OF HER WITH WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF OBSERVED AND WHAT HE HEARD FROM OTHERS AND FINALLY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ALL THINGS CONSIDERED SHE HAD MUCH BETTER REMAIN MISS WILSON OF RYECOTE FARM THAN BE TRANSMUTED INTO MRS LAWRENCE OF WOODFORD HALL
I SILENTLY READ IT AND RESTORED IT TO HIM WITHOUT COMMENT OR REMARK
HE LEFT ME EARLY IN FEBRUARY
IT WAS ONLY TO SAY,--'BRING IT BACK WHEN YOU HAVE READ IT
CLIFFS FULL FIVE MILES DISTANT
I WOULDN'T LOOK SO WHITE AND SO CALM AND BURST MY HEART WITH KEEPING IT IN I HAVE CRIED SAID I SMILING IN SPITE OF MY MISERY
YOU DON'T KNOW HELEN--YOU CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T IT BEFORE YOU
HE'S A DECENT QUIET FELLOW ENOUGH
BUT IF I HAD STINTED HIM IN HIS USUAL QUANTITY OF WINE OR FORBIDDEN HIM TO TASTE IT ALTOGETHER THAT WOULD ONLY HAVE INCREASED HIS PARTIALITY FOR IT AND MADE HIM REGARD IT AS A GREATER TREAT THAN EVER
I MAY TRY TO PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THE SWEETNESS OVERPOWERS IT
HUNTINGDON MEANWHILE SAT QUIETLY DRINKING HIS WINE,--OR LOOKING SMILINGLY INTO HIS GLASS AND OFFERING NO INTERRUPTION OR REPLY TILL HATTERSLEY SHOUTED OUT,--"DO YOU HEAR ME MAN YES GO ON SAID HE
I COULD NOT BUT FEEL GRATEFUL TO HIM UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
PERHAPS YOU CAN ASSIST ME TO REMEMBER IT
AND THOUGH I ALIGHTED AT YOUR GATES I DETERMINED NOT TO ENTER WITHIN THEM
WHEREAS WHEN HE HAD SOMETHING IN HIM IF HE WAS NOT MERRY HIMSELF HE WAS AN UNFAILING SOURCE OF MERRIMENT TO US
THERE WAS LITTLE BESIDES THE CHIMNEYS VISIBLE ABOVE MY CONTRACTED HORIZON
AND I SHALL NOT MOLEST YOU WITH MY COMPANY OR INTERFERENCE HERE
SHE MUST HAVE FOUND ME A VERY UNSOCIABLE COMPANION THIS TIME FOR RACHEL'S LAST WORDS RANG IN MY EARS
THOUGH TO BE SURE HE WOULD FIND LITTLE GOOD OF HIMSELF THEREIN INDITED EXCEPT IN THE FORMER PART
YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT HAVE LONG BEEN WANTING US TO GO THERE YOU KNOW
THE LIGHT OF YOUR COUNTENANCE BLESSES ME ONCE MORE AND YOU DESIRE THE CONTINUATION OF MY STORY
AND SOMETHING VERY LIKE A CLOUD OF DISAPPOINTMENT SHADOWED HER FACE
BUT IT IS ONLY FOR WANT OF THOUGHT
THEY TRIED ALL THEY COULD TO FIND OUT WHO SHE WAS AND WHERE SHE CAME FROM AND ALL ABOUT HER BUT NEITHER MRS WILSON WITH HER PERTINACIOUS AND IMPERTINENT HOME-THRUSTS NOR MISS WILSON WITH HER SKILFUL MANOEUVRING COULD MANAGE TO ELICIT A SINGLE SATISFACTORY ANSWER OR EVEN A CASUAL REMARK OR CHANCE EXPRESSION CALCULATED TO ALLAY THEIR CURIOSITY OR THROW THE FAINTEST RAY OF LIGHT UPON HER HISTORY CIRCUMSTANCES OR CONNECTIONS
HE LOST
THAT IS GRIMSBY SAID HE DELIBERATELY
I HAVE SOMETIMES SAID TO MYSELF NOW BOARHAM WHAT IS THIS YOU'RE AFTER
ARE WE NOT TO BE JUDGED ACCORDING TO THE DEEDS DONE IN THE BODY
BUT I'D NEVER GIVE UP AN OLD FRIEND FOR THE SAKE OF A WIFE
I HAVE NO WIFE REPLIED HUNTINGDON LOOKING INNOCENTLY UP FROM HIS GLASS OR IF I HAVE LOOK YOU GENTLEMEN
ONLY SOME ONE COME ABOUT THE PICTURES SAID SHE IN APOLOGY FOR HER ABRUPT DEPARTURE
BUT A FEELING ALMOST OF COMPASSION RIVETED ME TO THE SPOT
BUT IF SHE MUST MARRY AGAIN I KNOW OF NO ONE NOW LIVING AND OF A SUITABLE AGE TO WHOM I WOULD MORE WILLINGLY RESIGN HER THAN YOURSELF OR WHO WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO APPRECIATE HER WORTH AND MAKE HER TRULY HAPPY AS FAR AS I CAN TELL OF COURSE I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COMPLIMENT AND HOPED TO SHOW HER THAT SHE WAS NOT MISTAKEN IN HER FAVOURABLE JUDGMENT
PERHAPS THEN I WAS TOO SEVERE IN MY JUDGMENTS FOR I ABHORRED THE SINNER AS WELL AS THE SIN
YOU A YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED WOMAN DELICATELY NURTURED AND UTTERLY IN A WORD YOU WOULD ADVISE ME TO STAY WHERE I AM INTERRUPTED I
AND ACCORDINGLY I ENDEAVOUR TO SHOW THE FULLEST CONFIDENCE IN MY HUSBAND AND THE GREATEST INDIFFERENCE TO THE ARTS OF MY ATTRACTIVE GUEST
BUT NEVER MORE SHALL YOU ENTICE ME TO THAT DEVIL'S DEN THIS WAS SHAMEFUL LANGUAGE BUT I SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND WE PARTED
HELEN CRIED HE THE MOMENT I HAD LEFT THE ROOM
WHENEVER I MEET YOU ON HONEST GROUND OR UNDER A CHRISTIAN ROOF I SHALL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU
HE IS HEALTHY BUT NOT ROBUST FULL OF GENTLE PLAYFULNESS AND VIVACITY ALREADY AFFECTIONATE AND SUSCEPTIBLE OF PASSIONS AND EMOTIONS IT WILL BE LONG ERE HE CAN FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS
IN THE EVENING SHE SAT WITH US IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AND WOULD SING AND PLAY TO AMUSE HIM OR US AS SHE PRETENDED AND WAS VERY ATTENTIVE TO HIS WANTS AND WATCHFUL TO ANTICIPATE THEM THOUGH SHE ONLY TALKED TO ME
BUT BEING DETERMINED TO SEE YOU THIS TIME I HAVE LEFT MY PONY IN THE LANE AND COME OVER HEDGE AND DITCH TO JOIN YOU
WELL MR MARKHAM YOU THAT MAINTAIN THAT A BOY SHOULD NOT BE SHIELDED FROM EVIL BUT SENT OUT TO BATTLE AGAINST IT ALONE AND UNASSISTED--NOT TAUGHT TO AVOID THE SNARES OF LIFE BUT BOLDLY TO RUSH INTO THEM OR OVER THEM AS HE MAY--TO SEEK DANGER RATHER THAN SHUN IT AND FEED HIS VIRTUE BY TEMPTATION,--WOULD YOU I BEG YOUR PARDON MRS GRAHAM--BUT YOU GET ON TOO FAST
AND I HAD ALL ALONG BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS SEASON WITH THE FOND DELUSIVE HOPE THAT WE SHOULD ENJOY IT SO SWEETLY TOGETHER
IT SEEMED A WEARY TIME
HOW CAN I BE WHEN I THINK OF THE MOMENTOUS CHANGE THAT AWAITS ME AND OF ALL I HAVE TO LEAVE
WHAT DID YOU COME FOR
NO MATTER I ANSWERED TO YOU
WHAT NONSENSE IS THIS MR HARGRAVE SAID I PAUSING IN THE DOORWAY
WHEN HE IS UNDER THE DEPRESSING INFLUENCE OF THE AFTER-CONSEQUENCES HE BEMOANS HIS SUFFERINGS AND HIS ERRORS AND CHARGES THEM BOTH UPON ME
AND LEAVING ANNABELLA AND THE REST TO FOLLOW WHEN THEY PLEASED I WITHDREW BUT NOT TO BED
BUT HAVING SALUTED HIS HOST AND HOSTESS AND THE REST OF THE COMPANY HE CAME TO ME ARDENTLY SQUEEZED MY HAND AND MURMURED HE WAS GLAD TO SEE ME ONCE AGAIN
ALL THIS MAY STRIKE YOU AS HARSH BUT I FELT I MUST NOT LOSE MY PRESENT ADVANTAGE AND MY SON'S FUTURE WELFARE SHOULD NOT BE SACRIFICED TO ANY MISTAKEN TENDERNESS FOR THIS MAN'S FEELINGS
MR LAWRENCE HAD BEEN INVITED TO JOIN US BUT FOR SOME REASON BEST KNOWN TO HIMSELF HAD REFUSED TO GIVE US HIS COMPANY
BUT HE HAS NEVER OPENLY EXPRESSED ANY DISAPPROBATION OF HIM OR SYMPATHY FOR ME
THEN WHY DID SHE MARRY HIM SAID I
THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF MY FORGETTING YOU
OH NO CRIED SHE
AND MR HARGRAVE FINDING HIS SERVICES WERE NOT DESIRED JUDICIOUSLY WITHDREW
BUT IF THE DREARY TEMPEST CHILLS THERE IS A LIGHT THAT WARMS AGAIN
HE NEVER COULD HAVE LOVED ME OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE RESIGNED ME SO WILLINGLY AND HE WOULD NOT GO ON TALKING TO EVERYBODY ELSE SO CHEERFULLY AS HE DOES--LAUGHING AND JESTING WITH LORD LOWBOROUGH AND MY UNCLE TEASING MILICENT HARGRAVE AND FLIRTING WITH ANNABELLA WILMOT--AS IF NOTHING WERE ON HIS MIND
PUT THEM AWAY ELIZA WAS HASTILY SAYING JUST AS I ENTERED THE ROOM
AND I CAN'T ENDURE IT QUIETLY AND I WON'T WELL DON'T SQUEEZE MY HAND SO FRANTICALLY AND DON'T AGITATE ME SO FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
AND SOMETIMES HIS FATHER WOULD INSIST UPON MY LETTING HIM REMAIN
THEN WE MUST WAIT UNTIL YOU CAN HOLD IT SAID I
I HOPE NOT MR HARGRAVE RETURNED I WITH VEHEMENCE THAT MUST HAVE STARTLED MILICENT AT LEAST
HE TURNED AND LOOKED AT ME IN GRAVE SURPRISE
AND EVEN IF I DID IT WOULD HAVE PRECIOUS LITTLE EFFECT UPON HIM
I MUST LABOUR HARD TO IMPROVE MY TALENT AND TO PRODUCE SOMETHING WORTH WHILE AS A SPECIMEN OF MY POWERS SOMETHING TO SPEAK FAVOURABLY FOR ME WHETHER AS AN ACTUAL PAINTER OR A TEACHER
I WAS MISTAKEN
AND MRS GRAHAM TOOK HER CAMP-STOOL AND DRAWING MATERIALS
I WAS DETERMINED HIS WORDS SHOULD NOT ALARM ME
BUT MY UNCLE HAS ORDERED THE GAMEKEEPER TO SPARE THE PARTRIDGES TILL THE GENTLEMEN COME
IT'S THE LADIES THAT ARE ACCOMPANYING ME NOT I THEM
SHE WAS CRYING FROM PURE SHAME AND HUMILIATION FOR YOU
I HEARTILY WISH I COULD FIND THEM A JESTING MATTER
OF COURSE I WAS VERY PENITENT HE REPLIED
HE GREETED HIS HOST AND HIS COUSIN BOTH COLDLY AND ME WITH A GLANCE INTENDED TO EXPRESS THE DEEPEST SYMPATHY MINGLED WITH HIGH ADMIRATION AND ESTEEM
IT COST MORE TO REDEEM THEIR SOULS--IT COST THE BLOOD OF AN INCARNATE GOD PERFECT AND SINLESS IN HIMSELF TO REDEEM US FROM THE BONDAGE OF THE EVIL ONE:--LET HIM PLEAD FOR YOU BUT I SEEM TO SPEAK IN VAIN
AND I FLATTERED MYSELF I SHOULD THUS HAVE THE FELICITY OF SEEING THE TWO PERSONS I LIKE BEST IN THE WORLD--EXCEPT MAMMA--UNITED IN ONE
AND ON MY RETURN AT THE YEAR'S END I FOUND HIM STILL A DISCONSOLATE BACHELOR--THOUGH CERTAINLY LOOKING SOMEWHAT LESS LIKE AN UNBLEST EXILE FROM THE TOMB THAN BEFORE
IF THERE WERE LESS OF THIS DELICATE CONCEALMENT OF FACTS--THIS WHISPERING PEACE PEACE WHEN THERE IS NO PEACE THERE WOULD BE LESS OF SIN AND MISERY TO THE YOUNG OF BOTH SEXES WHO ARE LEFT TO WRING THEIR BITTER KNOWLEDGE FROM EXPERIENCE
HOLDING HIS PRAYER-BOOK UPSIDE DOWN OR OPEN AT ANY PLACE BUT THE RIGHT HE DID NOTHING BUT STARE ABOUT HIM UNLESS HE HAPPENED TO CATCH MY AUNT'S EYE OR MINE AND THEN HE WOULD DROP HIS OWN ON HIS BOOK WITH A PURITANICAL AIR OF MOCK SOLEMNITY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LUDICROUS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN TOO PROVOKING
BUT THAT SUITED ME ALL THE BETTER TOO
BUT I HAVE HAD NO LEISURE TO PASS ANY COMMENTS UPON THEM TILL NOW
I DON'T ASK THE REASON OF THIS CHANGE GILBERT SAID SHE WITH BITTER CALMNESS
BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT AFTER MY BROTHER'S MISADVENTURE I ONCE OR TWICE RAISED THE CUP TO MY LIPS AND PUT IT DOWN AGAIN WITHOUT DARING TO TASTE THE CONTENTS LEST I SHOULD INJURE MY DIGNITY BY A SIMILAR EXPLOSION
WILL YOU RUN AWAY AGAIN IT ENTIRELY DEPENDS UPON YOUR OWN CONDUCT OH I'LL BE VERY GOOD BUT IF I FIND IT NECESSARY TO LEAVE YOU ARTHUR I SHALL NOT RUN AWAY
I EXPERIENCED A PAINFUL COMMISERATION FOR HER UNHAPPY HUSBAND THOUGH FULLY AWARE THAT HE HAD BROUGHT EVERY PARTICLE OF HIS SUFFERINGS UPON HIMSELF AND BUT TOO WELL DESERVED THEM ALL AND A PROFOUND SYMPATHY FOR HER OWN AFFLICTIONS AND DEEP ANXIETY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE HARASSING CARES THOSE DREADFUL VIGILS THAT INCESSANT AND DELETERIOUS CONFINEMENT BESIDE A LIVING CORPSE--FOR I WAS PERSUADED SHE HAD NOT HINTED HALF THE SUFFERINGS SHE HAD HAD TO ENDURE
I RESPECT YOU--AT LEAST I WOULD RESPECT YOU IF YOU WOULD BEHAVE LIKE A SENSIBLE MAN--BUT I CANNOT LOVE YOU AND NEVER COULD--AND THE MORE YOU TALK THE FURTHER YOU REPEL ME
THIS IS INTOLERABLE WHAT IS
AND BY THE FACT OF HIS SO SELDOM MENTIONING MY HUSBAND AND GENERALLY EVINCING A KIND OF COVERT BITTERNESS WHEN HE DOES REFER TO HIM
BUT BE QUICK WILL YOU RACHEL
I KNOW IT IS CHIEFLY THE RESULT OF HIS ENFEEBLED FRAME AND DISORDERED NERVES
AND AGAIN WE RELAPSED INTO SILENCE
HOW EAGERLY I OPEN AND DEVOUR ONE OF THOSE LITTLE HASTILY-SCRIBBLED RETURNS FOR THE THREE OR FOUR LONG LETTERS HITHERTO UNANSWERED HE HAS HAD FROM ME
HE SAW I WAS IN NO HUMOUR TO BE SPOKEN TO AND SUFFERED ME TO PASS WITHOUT A WORD
I WOULD LEAVE YOU TO-MORROW CONTINUED I AND NEVER AGAIN COME UNDER THIS ROOF BUT FOR MY CHILD'--I PAUSED A MOMENT TO STEADY MY VOICE
IT WAS A SPLENDID MORNING
BUT AS I WENT THE TRAMP OF HORSES HOOFS FELL ON MY EAR AND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE DEWY EVENING
HER BROTHER HAD GIVEN ME NO INTIMATION TO THE CONTRARY
BUT I WAS SATISFIED THERE WAS NO JEALOUSY THEREIN
FOOTNOTES
BUT I WAS DETERMINED HE SHOULD NOT KEEP IT
WHILE I SAT WITH MILICENT HARGRAVE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE ROOM LOOKING OVER THE LATTER'S DRAWINGS AND AIDING HER WITH MY CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS AND ADVICE AT HER PARTICULAR DESIRE
THE TIME THAT I MET HIM ALONE WAS ON A BRIGHT BUT NOT OPPRESSIVELY HOT DAY IN THE BEGINNING OF JULY
HOWEVER NO ONE SEEMED TO NOTICE HER AND SHORTLY AFTER WE WERE SUMMONED TO THE TEA-TABLE
LOOK MR MARKHAM A NATURAL HISTORY WITH ALL KINDS OF BIRDS AND BEASTS IN IT AND THE READING AS NICE AS THE PICTURES IN GREAT GOOD HUMOUR I SAT DOWN TO EXAMINE THE BOOK AND DREW THE LITTLE FELLOW BETWEEN MY KNEES
PROCLAIMING IT ALOUD AS HE DID WITHOUT DELICACY OR DISCRIMINATION IN AN AUDIENCE WHERE IT SEEMED PROFANATION TO UTTER YOUR NAME
I HAVE LEARNED TO APPEAR SO BY DINT OF HARD LESSONS AND MANY REPEATED EFFORTS AT THIS JUNCTURE MR HATTERSLEY BURST INTO THE ROOM
YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU AND HE PRESSED MY HAND TO HIS FEVERISH LIPS AND WHAT MORE COULD YOU DESIRE ONLY ARTHUR THAT YOU WOULD LOVE YOURSELF AS TRULY AND AS FAITHFULLY AS YOU ARE LOVED BY ME THAT WOULD BE HARD INDEED HE REPLIED TENDERLY SQUEEZING MY HAND
HE MIGHT AMUSE HIMSELF JUST AS HE PLEASED IN REGULAR BACHELOR STYLE AND SHE NEVER COMPLAINED OF NEGLECT
I SHOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH HER IF I HADN'T THE ARTIST BEFORE ME
I WOULD SEE MRS HUNTINGDON--THERE COULD BE NO IMPROPRIETY IN THAT NOW THAT HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN DEAD ABOVE A YEAR--AND BY HER INDIFFERENCE OR HER JOY AT MY UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL I COULD SOON TELL WHETHER HER HEART WAS TRULY MINE
AND I CAN'T HELP FEELING SURPRISED THAT YOU SHOULD LIKE HIM SO MUCH WHY SO BECAUSE YOU ARE SO SUPERIOR TO HIM IN EVERY WAY AND THERE'S SOMETHING SO BOLD AND RECKLESS ABOUT HIM--SO I DON'T KNOW HOW--BUT I ALWAYS FEEL A WISH TO GET OUT OF HIS WAY WHEN I SEE HIM APPROACH YOU ARE TIMID MILICENT
BUT WHILE I PONDERED FOR SOMETHING TO SAY THAT MIGHT BENEFIT WITHOUT ALARMING HIM HATTERSLEY WHOSE MIND HAD BEEN PURSUING ALMOST THE SAME COURSE BROKE SILENCE WITH I SAY HUNTINGDON I WOULD SEND FOR A PARSON OF SOME SORT
FINE LAND THIS SAID ONE OF THEM POINTING WITH HIS UMBRELLA TO THE WIDE FIELDS ON THE RIGHT CONSPICUOUS FOR THEIR COMPACT HEDGEROWS DEEP WELL-CUT DITCHES AND FINE TIMBER-TREES GROWING SOMETIMES ON THE BORDERS SOMETIMES IN THE MIDST OF THE ENCLOSURE
THEN LOOKING LOVINGLY IN HER FACE AND STILL RETAINING HER HAND IN HIS MURMURED PATHETICALLY THE LAST--LAST DAY YES SAID SHE WITH SOME ASPERITY
AND AS SUCH I HAVE EVER SINCE REGARDED HIM
BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULDN'T BEAT HER FOR VERY FEAR
I SHOULD ENTIRELY EXCLUDE POOR MILICENT IN MY GENERAL ANIMADVERSIONS AGAINST THE LADIES OF MY ACQUAINTANCE
HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS PILLOWS AND GAZED UPON ME WITH EQUAL DEGREES OF NERVOUS HORROR ANGER AND AMAZEMENT DEPICTED ON HIS COUNTENANCE
IN A MINUTE HE WAS KNEELING ON THE CARPET WITH HIS ARMS ROUND SANCHO'S NECK AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO MORE THE LITTLE FELLOW WAS SEATED ON MY KNEE SURVEYING WITH EAGER INTEREST THE VARIOUS SPECIMENS OF HORSES CATTLE PIGS AND MODEL FARMS PORTRAYED IN THE VOLUME BEFORE ME
THERE IS JOY AND GLORY AFTER IF YOU WILL BUT TRY TO REACH IT WHAT FOR ME HE SAID WITH SOMETHING LIKE A LAUGH
I WIPED AWAY THE COLD DROPS THAT WERE TRICKLING DOWN MY FOREHEAD AND STEPPED BACK AS HE APPROACHED
THERE NOW HELEN I SAID AS THE APPROACHING STEPS OF RACHEL WERE HEARD IN ANSWER TO THE SUMMONS
HERE JACOB BUT CHECKING THE WORD ON HER LIPS I SEIZED HER ARM AND GAVE IT I THINK A PRETTY SEVERE SQUEEZE FOR SHE SHRANK INTO HERSELF WITH A FAINT CRY OF PAIN OR TERROR
NO LOVE REPLIED HE LAUGHING IMMODERATELY AT THE RECOLLECTION OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR
AND THE WORST SYMPTOM OF THE CASE IS THAT THE FURTHER HE IS FROM ME THE BETTER I LIKE HIM
AND FINALLY SHE SAID SHE WAS WELL AND VERY BUSY WITH HER SON'S EDUCATION AND WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF HER LATE HUSBAND'S PROPERTY AND THE REGULATION OF HIS AFFAIRS
AND HE TOLD ME SOMETHING ABOUT A PIECE OF PROPERTY HE WANTED TO SELL IN ORDER TO PAY OFF A PART OF THE INCUMBRANCES ON HIS ESTATE
HE WANTS NONE O MY COMPANY NOR I HIS--THAT'S CERTAIN I WISH YOU'D TELL HIM SO THEN SAID MY AUNT
1 THIS PREFACE IS NOW PRINTED HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A COLLECTED EDITION OF THE WORKS OF THE BRONTE SISTERS
I CAN HARDLY GIVE IT A MILDER NAME WHEN I THINK OF THE EVILS IT BRINGS
MOST LIKELY SHE WAS GONE AWAY AND THE TALE-BEARING SERVANT NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS BECOME OF HER HAD CONJECTURED THAT SUCH WAS THE CASE AND OUR FAIR VISITOR HAD DETAILED IT AS A CERTAINTY DELIGHTED WITH SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY OF TORMENTING ME
MR LAWRENCE CAME TOO
I WILL NOT BE SUCH A HYPOCRITE AS TO PRETEND THAT I DESIRE TO WAIT SO LONG MYSELF BUT AS MY MARRIAGE IS TO PLEASE MYSELF ALONE I OUGHT TO CONSULT MY FRIENDS ABOUT THE TIME OF IT YOUR FRIENDS WILL DISAPPROVE THEY WILL NOT GREATLY DISAPPROVE DEAR GILBERT SAID SHE EARNESTLY KISSING MY HAND
BOARHAM AND WILMOT HAVE CEASED TO TEASE ME AND MY AUNT HAS CEASED TO LECTURE ME AND I HAVE CEASED TO BE JEALOUS OF ANNABELLA--AND EVEN TO DISLIKE HER--AND NOW THAT MR HUNTINGDON IS BECOME MY ARTHUR AND I MAY ENJOY HIS SOCIETY WITHOUT RESTRAINT
THIS PUT ME ON MY GUARD
HE WAS NOT GOING TO HAVE THE LITTLE FELLOW MOPED TO DEATH BETWEEN AN OLD NURSE AND A CURSED FOOL OF A MOTHER
SHE THEN BID ME GOOD-EVENING AND WITHDREW
SUCH HUMBLE TALENTS AS GOD HAS GIVEN ME I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO PUT TO THEIR GREATEST USE
DON'T WORRY ME ABOUT THEM
TOIL-SPENT AND TRAVEL-STAINED THE MAIN BODY OF THEM CROSSED OVER THE GRASS TO AVOID US BUT MR HUNTINGDON ALL SPATTERED AND SPLASHED AS HE WAS AND STAINED WITH THE BLOOD OF HIS PREY--TO THE NO SMALL OFFENCE OF MY AUNT'S STRICT SENSE OF PROPRIETY--CAME OUT OF HIS WAY TO MEET US WITH CHEERFUL SMILES AND WORDS FOR ALL BUT ME AND PLACING HIMSELF BETWEEN ANNABELLA WILMOT AND MYSELF WALKED UP THE ROAD AND BEGAN TO RELATE THE VARIOUS EXPLOITS AND DISASTERS OF THE DAY IN A MANNER THAT WOULD HAVE CONVULSED ME WITH LAUGHTER IF I HAD BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM
MRS HARGRAVE DID NOT VISIT LONDON THAT SEASON
OR YOU'RE A STRANGER IN THESE PARTS I KNOW THEM BY REPORT HUMPH
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT SPOILS YOU
I RENOUNCE IT FOR EVER AND HE THREW IT OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE
PARTLY FROM ACCIDENT PARTLY FROM WILFUL NEGLIGENCE ON MY PART FOR I WAS REALLY BEGINNING TO DISLIKE HIM SEVERAL WEEKS ELAPSED BEFORE I SAW MY FRIEND AGAIN
THERE NOW--THERE GILBERT--LET ME GO--HERE'S ARTHUR
ARE YOU AT IT YET?--THERE
FOR THEN I KNOW HE IS REALLY DELIGHTED AND I HAVE NO POWER TO AWAKEN SIMILAR FERVOUR
SHE HAD OFTEN WALKED THERE WITH ME IN HER ARMS AND LITTLE THOUGHT TO COME AGAIN SO MANY YEARS AFTER UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS THE PRESENT
IT MUST BE PERFORMED HOWEVER IN SOME FASHION
A BURST OF PASSION IS A FINE ROUSING THING UPON OCCASION HELEN AND A FLOOD OF TEARS IS MARVELLOUSLY AFFECTING BUT WHEN INDULGED TOO OFTEN THEY ARE BOTH DEUCED PLAGUY THINGS FOR SPOILING ONE'S BEAUTY AND TIRING OUT ONE'S FRIENDS THENCEFORTH I RESTRAINED MY TEARS AND PASSIONS AS MUCH AS I COULD
I TOLD HIM I'D LEAVE HIM IF HE DIDN'T MEND HIS MANNERS AND HE WOULDN'T
TO GRASSDALE
I DID NOT COMPLAIN OF ITS PUNISHMENT AND I WAS SORRY TO TROUBLE MY FRIENDS WITH ITS CONSEQUENCES
WELL AS I CANNOT PROVE IT I MUST CONTENT MYSELF WITH ASSERTING THAT IT IS SO TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF
OH HOW HE ANNOYED ME
BUT HE FOLLOWED AND KEPT HIS HORSE AT MY SIDE
THE HOVERING CLOUD CAST OVER ME BY MY AUNT'S VIEWS AND BY THE FEAR OF NOT OBTAINING HER CONSENT WAS LOST IN THE BRIGHT EFFULGENCE OF MY OWN HOPES AND THE TOO DELIGHTFUL CONSCIOUSNESS OF REQUITED LOVE
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE HE MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MISS WILMOT
A COLD WET APRIL AND TWO WEEKS OF MAY PASSED OVER BEFORE WE COULD VENTURE FORTH ON OUR EXPEDITION WITH THE REASONABLE HOPE OF OBTAINING THAT PLEASURE WE SOUGHT IN PLEASANT PROSPECTS CHEERFUL SOCIETY FRESH AIR GOOD CHEER AND EXERCISE WITHOUT THE ALLOY OF BAD ROADS COLD WINDS OR THREATENING CLOUDS
THEN TURNING TO ME SHE CALMLY SAID,--'TO-MORROW IF YOU MEET ME ON THE MOOR ABOUT MID-DAY I WILL TELL YOU ALL YOU SEEK TO KNOW
ON SUCH OCCASIONS I HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN STARTLED BY A SUBTLE FIENDISH SUGGESTION INCITING ME TO SHOW HIM THE CONTRARY BY A SEEMING ENCOURAGEMENT OF HARGRAVE'S ADVANCES
AND TELLING HIM IN FEW WORDS THE CAUSE OF MY SUDDEN RESOLUTION
HIS BODY WILL BE CONSIGNED ON THURSDAY TO THAT DARK GRAVE HE SO MUCH DREADED
IT IS STILL RUNNING IN MY HEAD AND SO ARE THE WORDS FAREWELL TO THEE
YOU NEEDN'T FEAR TO SAY ANYTHING IN MY PRESENCE WELL ANSWERED SHE PERHAPS YOU KNOW ALREADY THAT MRS GRAHAM'S HUSBAND IS NOT REALLY DEAD AND THAT SHE HAD RUN AWAY FROM HIM I STARTED AND FELT MY FACE GLOW
SHE'S THINKING THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN SHE WILL BE WOOED AND WON LIKE THAT PRETTY HEN-DOVE BY AS FOND AND FERVENT A LOVER
BUT I SHALL BE GLAD OF MILICENT'S COMPANY
INDEED HE WAS A MODEL OF MODERATION AND PRUDENCE--SOMETHING TOO MUCH SO FOR THE TASTES OF OUR WILD COMMUNITY
MY DEAR YOUNG LADY SAID HE BOWING AND SMIRKING WITH GREAT COMPLACENCY I HAVE YOUR KIND GUARDIAN'S PERMISSION I KNOW SIR SAID I WISHING TO SHORTEN THE SCENE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND I AM GREATLY OBLIGED FOR YOUR PREFERENCE BUT MUST BEG TO DECLINE THE HONOUR YOU WISH TO CONFER FOR I THINK WE WERE NOT MADE FOR EACH OTHER AS YOU YOURSELF WOULD SHORTLY DISCOVER IF THE EXPERIMENT WERE TRIED MY AUNT WAS RIGHT
MARY--MARY
AND NO PERSUASION CAN ALTER MY INCLINATIONS OR INDUCE ME TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH A STEP WOULD BE CONDUCIVE TO MY HAPPINESS OR YOURS--AND I WONDER THAT A MAN OF YOUR EXPERIENCE AND DISCRETION SHOULD THINK OF CHOOSING SUCH A WIFE AH WELL SAID HE I HAVE SOMETIMES WONDERED AT THAT MYSELF
THE MILLWARDS AND THE WILSONS SHOULD SEE WITH THEIR OWN EYES THE BRIGHT SUN BURSTING FROM THE CLOUD--AND THEY SHOULD BE SCORCHED AND DAZZLED BY ITS BEAMS;--AND MY OWN FRIENDS TOO SHOULD SEE IT--THEY WHOSE SUSPICIONS HAD BEEN SUCH GALL AND WORMWOOD TO MY SOUL
IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE VICAR YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE HIS CURATE OR SOMEBODY ELSE NO
YOU HAVE HEARD THEN WHAT THEY SAY OF ME I HEARD SOME DETESTABLE FALSEHOODS
YOU WOULD SAY THAT IT WAS NO BUSINESS OF YOURS
HE IMAGINED A GUILTY ROMANCE WITH HIMSELF AND HIS EMPLOYER'S WIFE FOR CHARACTERS AND HE IMPOSED THE HORRID STORY UPON HIS SISTERS
I WENT TO HER AS SOON AS I HAD PUT AWAY MY BOOK AND TOLD HER HOW OUR PROJECT WAS DEFEATED
I SHOULD NOT HAVE ENCOURAGED HER TO DO SO HAD SHE BEEN INCLINED
BUT MAMMA TELLS ME I HAVE AND HE SEEMS TO THINK SO TOO
IT SEEMED TO DWELL CONTINUALLY ON HER MIND AND SHE KEPT IRRITATING ME FROM TIME TO TIME BY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS--'DEAR DEAR WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT!--WELL
THIS IS TWICE YOU HAVE DELIVERED ME FROM SUCH UNPLEASANT COMPANIONSHIP DON'T BE TOO THANKFUL HE ANSWERED
AND BESIDES SHE IS TOO OLD TO RUN AFTER A CHILD AND HE IS TOO MERCURIAL TO BE TIED TO AN ELDERLY WOMAN BUT YOU LEFT HIM TO COME TO CHURCH YES ONCE
THEN INDEED HE BEGAN TO HOPE FOR A DAWN OF BRIGHTER DAYS
IF HE STUMBLED A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE HE MUST GO DOWN BEFORE HE COULD RIGHT HIMSELF
AND UPON MY WORD BLACK BOSS AND GREY TOM AND THAT YOUNG NIMROD ARE THE FINEST ANIMALS I'VE SEEN FOR MANY A DAY THEN FOLLOWED A PARTICULAR DISCUSSION OF THEIR VARIOUS MERITS SUCCEEDED BY A SKETCH OF THE GREAT THINGS HE INTENDED TO DO IN THE HORSE-JOCKEY LINE WHEN HIS OLD GOVERNOR THOUGHT PROPER TO QUIT THE STAGE
BESIDES I LIKE TO ENJOY MY LIFE AT ALL SIDES AND ENDS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY ONE THAT SUFFERS HIMSELF TO BE THE SLAVE OF A SINGLE PROPENSITY--AND MOREOVER DRINKING SPOILS ONE'S GOOD LOOKS HE CONCLUDED WITH A MOST CONCEITED SMILE THAT OUGHT TO HAVE PROVOKED ME MORE THAN IT DID
NEVER HAD SHE LOOKED SO LOVELY
YOU DO WELL TO REMIND ME OF THE LADIES YOU DASTARDLY DESERTER CRIED HE SHAKING HIS FORMIDABLE FIST AT HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW
I CANNOT SHUT MY EYES TO ARTHUR'S FAULTS
AND I WAS DESIRED TO STEP INTO THE PARLOUR AND WAIT
WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN AMISS IN ME AND WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME TO DO NOTHING MORE THAN YOU DO ARTHUR
DO YOU NOT FIND IT A DESOLATE PLACE TO LIVE IN SAID I AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENT CONTEMPLATION
FEW CAN BLAME HER FEWER STILL CAN PITY HIM
I DON'T LIKE YOU I CONTINUED AS DELIBERATELY AND EMPHATICALLY AS I COULD TO GIVE THE GREATER EFFICACY TO MY WORDS
WHAT WAS MY FATHER TO ME
LOOK GILBERT IT IS STILL FRESH AND BLOOMING AS A FLOWER CAN BE WITH THE COLD SNOW EVEN NOW ON ITS PETALS.--WILL YOU HAVE IT I HELD OUT MY HAND
AND I WISH YOU BOTH A HAPPY JOURNEY AND WITHDREW LAUGHING TO HIS CHAMBER
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO TIDY MY HAIR SHE ANSWERED SMILING THROUGH HER DISORDERED LOCKS
HERE'S MR MARKHAM ARTHUR'S FRIEND
WHAT BUSINESS HAD I TO LOOK FOR IT
HE IS GONE AT LAST
THANK YOU MR MARKHAM SAID SHE AS I PRESENTED IT TO HER
AND I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVINCE HIM OF HIS MISTAKE
THERE IS NO FIRE IN THE SITTING-ROOM TO-DAY AND IT IS RATHER TOO COLD TO SHOW YOU INTO A PLACE WITH AN EMPTY GRATE AND DISENGAGING A COUPLE OF CHAIRS FROM THE ARTISTICAL LUMBER THAT USURPED THEM SHE BID US BE SEATED AND RESUMED HER PLACE BESIDE THE EASEL--NOT FACING IT EXACTLY BUT NOW AND THEN GLANCING AT THE PICTURE UPON IT WHILE SHE CONVERSED AND GIVING IT AN OCCASIONAL TOUCH WITH HER BRUSH AS IF SHE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WEAN HER ATTENTION ENTIRELY FROM HER OCCUPATION TO FIX IT UPON HER GUESTS
BUT IF YOU SAW HOW THEY ABUSE ME HELEN YOU WOULD LOVE ME ALL THE MORE FOR HAVING VENTURED SO MUCH FOR YOUR SAKE HE PULLED OUT HIS CRUMPLED LETTERS
SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS A CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER AND HAD BEEN LEFT AN ORPHAN FROM HER CHILDHOOD BUT HAD HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO OBTAIN A SITUATION IN A VERY PIOUS FAMILY
BUT I HEARD THAT YOU WERE ILL AND ALONE AND I AM COME BACK TO NURSE YOU
HE IS DECIDEDLY BETTER BUT VERY LOW FROM THE DEPRESSING EFFECTS OF HIS SEVERE ILLNESS AND THE STRICT REGIMEN HE IS OBLIGED TO OBSERVE--SO OPPOSITE TO ALL HIS PREVIOUS HABITS
BUT SHE IS STILL IN TOWN WITH HER MOTHER
WHAT IS THAT BOOK HELEN HE EXCLAIMED
WE MUST DEFER THE ENJOYMENT OF YOUR HOSPITALITY TILL THE RETURN OF LONGER DAYS AND WARMER NIGHTS ROSE NOW AT A HINT FROM MY MOTHER PRODUCED A DECANTER OF WINE WITH ACCOMPANIMENTS OF GLASSES AND CAKE FROM THE CUPBOARD AND THE OAK SIDEBOARD AND THE REFRESHMENT WAS DULY PRESENTED TO THE GUESTS
SHE SEEMED AGITATED AND EVEN DISMAYED AT MY ARRIVAL AS IF SHE THOUGHT I TOO WAS COMING TO ACCUSE HER
AND I CAN FORGIVE YOUR UNCHARITABLE CONCLUSIONS
YOU MAY SIT THERE TILL DOOMSDAY FOR WHAT I CARE
NOT DESIROUS OF SHARING MR BOARHAM'S COMPANY FOR THE WHOLE OF THE MORNING I BETOOK MYSELF TO THE LIBRARY AND THERE BROUGHT FORTH MY EASEL AND BEGAN TO PAINT
HE IS NOT A BAD HUSBAND BUT HIS NOTIONS OF MATRIMONIAL DUTIES AND COMFORTS ARE NOT MY NOTIONS
WHAT THE DEVIL IS THIS AND I SAW BY THE FAINT LIGHT GLEAMING THROUGH THE OVERSHADOWING TREE THAT HE WAS POSITIVELY PALE WITH THE SHOCK
THOSE TWO WILL GET THE START OF US HELEN IF WE DON'T LOOK SHARP OBSERVED HUNTINGDON
HE MOVED HIS EYELIDS AND UTTERED A SLIGHT GROAN
MR HARGRAVE IS STILL AT THE GROVE
BUT WHEN I DID HAPPEN TO MEET HIM I SELDOM FAILED TO ASK AFTER THE PROGRESS OF HIS MATRIMONIAL EFFORTS AND RESEARCHES AND IN GENERAL HE COULD GIVE ME BUT A POOR ACCOUNT
GRASSDALE NOV
HER DELIGHT IN HAVING ME NEAR HER SEATED OR STANDING BY HER SIDE WHISPERING IN HER EAR OR PRESSING HER HAND IN THE DANCE WAS PLAINLY LEGIBLE IN HER GLOWING FACE AND HEAVING BOSOM HOWEVER BELIED BY SAUCY WORDS AND GESTURES
I SOMETIMES THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE DIED
HE EITHER HAS NOT THE SENSE OR THE POWER TO FOLLOW MY EXAMPLE THOUGH HE DOES TRY TO CONCEAL HIS UNEASINESS AS WELL AS HE CAN
LAWRENCE ATTEMPTED TO DRAW ME INTO CONVERSATION BUT I SNUBBED HIM AND WENT TO ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM
HAVING FORMED THIS RESOLUTION I IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO ACCOMPLISH IT I MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO WAX COOL UPON IT AFTERWARDS OR PERHAPS TO KEEP WEIGHING THE PROS AND CONS IN MY MIND TILL THE LATTER OVERBALANCED THE FORMER AND I WAS DRIVEN TO RELINQUISH THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER OR DELAY THE EXECUTION OF IT TO AN INDEFINITE PERIOD HAD NOT SOMETHING OCCURRED TO CONFIRM ME IN THAT DETERMINATION TO WHICH I STILL ADHERE WHICH I STILL THINK I DID WELL TO FORM AND SHALL DO BETTER TO EXECUTE
FOR NOTHING LESS COULD HAVE CURED MY INFATUATION
AND FROM THAT TIME FORWARD HE HAS BEEN A PATTERN OF PROPRIETY AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
NO NO I EXCLAIMED STRUGGLING TO FREE MYSELF FROM HIM--'YOU MUST ASK MY UNCLE AND AUNT THEY WON'T REFUSE ME IF YOU DON'T I'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT--MY AUNT DISLIKES YOU BUT YOU DON'T HELEN--SAY YOU LOVE ME AND I'LL GO I WISH YOU WOULD GO I REPLIED
YET I WITHDREW IN SILENCE
AND WHILE I HELD IT THERE I HAD MUCH DIFFICULTY TO REFRAIN FROM PRESSING IT TO MY LIPS;--BUT THAT WOULD BE SUICIDAL MADNESS
ARTHUR WAS SOON AT MY SIDE AGAIN
THEY DID NOT KNOW I WAS NEAR FOR I HAPPENED TO BE STANDING BEHIND THE CURTAIN IN THE BOW OF THE WINDOW WATCHING THE MOON RISING OVER THE CLUMP OF TALL DARK ELM-TREES BELOW THE LAWN AND WONDERING WHY ARTHUR WAS SO SENTIMENTAL AS TO STAND WITHOUT LEANING AGAINST THE OUTER PILLAR OF THE PORTICO APPARENTLY WATCHING IT TOO
AND IF THE LATTER HAD CHOSEN TO COMPLY HE MIGHT IN A NIGHT OR TWO HAVE RUINED THE LABOUR OF WEEKS AND OVERTHROWN WITH A TOUCH THE FRAIL BULWARK IT HAD COST ME SUCH TROUBLE AND TOIL TO CONSTRUCT
IT WAS SCARCELY PRUDENT TO MAKE SUCH AN ADMISSION OR TO ADD--AS SHE PRESENTLY DID--'I HAVE POWER TO BID YOU GO NOW
JUNE 10_TH 1847
I LOOKED HIM IN THE FACE TILL HE SULLENLY TURNED AWAY IF NOT ASHAMED AT LEAST CONFOUNDED FOR THE MOMENT
FOR MR HATTERSLEY HEARING OF HIS DANGER HAD COME TO SEE HIM FROM HIS DISTANT HOME IN THE NORTH
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THIS BEFORE
AND I TOOK A SECRET DELIGHT IN PRESSING THOSE SLENDER WHITE FINGERS SO MARVELLOUSLY LIKE HER OWN CONSIDERING HE WAS NOT A WOMAN AND IN WATCHING THE PASSING CHANGES IN HIS FAIR PALE FEATURES AND OBSERVING THE INTONATIONS OF HIS VOICE DETECTING RESEMBLANCES WHICH I WONDERED HAD NEVER STRUCK ME BEFORE
SHE CAN'T DENY IT IF HER LIFE DEPENDED ON IT AND MUTTERING SOME MORE ABUSIVE LANGUAGE HE WALKED INTO THE HALL AND TOOK UP HIS HAT AND GUN FROM THE TABLE
WAS THAT MRS GRAHAM YOU WERE SPEAKING TO JUST NOW SAID HE AFTER THE FIRST FEW WORDS OF GREETING HAD PASSED BETWEEN US
AND THOUGH I WISHED IT TO TERMINATE I WOULD NOT HAVE HASTENED ITS CLOSE IF BY THE LIFTING OF A FINGER I COULD HAVE DONE SO OR IF A SPIRIT HAD WHISPERED IN MY EAR THAT A SINGLE EFFORT OF THE WILL WOULD BE ENOUGH,--UNLESS INDEED I HAD THE POWER TO EXCHANGE HIM FOR SOME OTHER VICTIM OF THE GRAVE WHOSE LIFE MIGHT BE OF SERVICE TO HIS RACE AND WHOSE DEATH WOULD BE LAMENTED BY HIS FRIENDS
BUT DON'T YOU THINK MR HUNTINGDON'S FACE IS TOO RED NO CRIED I INDIGNANTLY
O HEAVENS HOW MY TEMPLES THROBBED
MAYN'T A MAN CHANGE HIS MIND ON FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE YES OF COURSE RETURNED HE NICELY REDUCING AN ENTANGLEMENT IN THE PONY'S REDUNDANT HOARY MANE
SHE SUFFERED THESE WILD CARESSES WITHOUT RESISTANCE OR RESENTMENT
EVERY VENTURE WAS THE JUST ONCE MORE IF HE GAINED A LITTLE HE HOPED TO GAIN A LITTLE MORE NEXT TIME AND IF HE LOST IT WOULD NOT DO TO LEAVE OFF AT THAT JUNCTURE
AND TAKING UP MY COAT I DEPOSITED THE BOOK IN ONE OF ITS POCKETS AND THEN PUT IT ON I.E THE COAT NOW COME HERE YOU IDLE DOG AND MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL FOR ONCE I CONTINUED
I WAS READY TO FAINT
A FEW MONTHS ARDUOUS TOIL MIGHT WELL BE BORNE BY ME WITH SUCH AN END IN VIEW
SPARE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE OF FORSWEARING YOURSELF AND RACKING YOUR BRAINS TO STIFLE TRUTH WITH FALSEHOOD I COLDLY REPLIED
WITH A SLIGHT START I SAW HIM GLANCE TOWARDS IT
SHE WAS RESOLVED TO KNOW THE WORST AND DETERMINED TO DARE IT TOO
HAD HE COME A MINUTE BEFORE I SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED HIM LESS GRACIOUSLY BUT NOW I AFFECTIONATELY STROKED HIS CURLING LOOKS AND EVEN KISSED HIS IVORY FOREHEAD
WHY HAVE THEY LEFT YOU ALONE I ASKED
I KNOW YOU NEVER TAKE IT UP EXCEPT TO PASS AN IDLE HOUR WHEN THERE IS NOTHING BETTER YOU CAN DO BUT CHESS-PLAYERS ARE SO UNSOCIABLE I OBJECTED
AND WILL THIS CONTENT YOU SAID SHE AS SHE TOOK IT IN HER HAND
FOR IF THIS BEAUTIFUL WEATHER CONTINUE I SHALL PERHAPS BE ABLE TO WALK THERE AND TAKE MY SKETCH
I HARDLY EVER LEAVE HIM EXCEPT TO GO INTO THE NEXT ROOM WHERE I SOMETIMES SNATCH AN HOUR OR SO OF SLEEP WHEN HE IS QUIET
THUS SEVERAL HOURS HAVE PASSED AWAY
THAT IS THE WAY
BUT SOMETIMES I SAW HER MYSELF NOT ONLY WHEN SHE CAME TO CHURCH BUT WHEN SHE WAS OUT ON THE HILLS WITH HER SON WHETHER TAKING A LONG PURPOSE-LIKE WALK OR--ON SPECIAL FINE DAYS--LEISURELY RAMBLING OVER THE MOOR OR THE BLEAK PASTURE-LANDS SURROUNDING THE OLD HALL HERSELF WITH A BOOK IN HER HAND HER SON GAMBOLLING ABOUT HER
CHAPTER XI YOU MUST SUPPOSE ABOUT THREE WEEKS PASSED OVER
THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT MANY OF THE PAGES ARE CLOSE TRANSCRIPTS FROM BRANWELL'S CONDUCT AND LANGUAGE,--SO FAR AS ANNE'S SLIGHTER PERSONALITY ENABLED HER TO RENDER HER BROTHER'S TEMPERAMENT WHICH WAS MORE AKIN TO EMILY'S THAN TO HER OWN
YOU'LL DO IT AGAIN I SHALL NEVER LIVE TO DO IT AGAIN IF YOU TREAT ME SO SAVAGELY REPLIED HE PUSHING ME FROM HIM
THOUGH SHE AFFECTED TO RESENT HIS INSOLENCE AND TO KEEP HIM AT BAY WITH SALLIES OF SMART AND SPIRITED REPARTEE
I DARESAY IT WAS WHITE ENOUGH
I WILL BE MORE CAUTIOUS IN FUTURE
AND SO I KEPT IT
IT WAS NOT THAT
BUT HOWEVER I KNOW YOU HAVE BETTER MOTIVES REALLY FOR YOUR PERSEVERANCE
WE MUST GO UPON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN WHAT GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE YOU MADE NOW MR HUNTINGDON
I CAME TO HEAR YOUR EXPLANATION AND I TELL YOU I WON'T GIVE IT RETORTED SHE PACING THE ROOM IN A STATE OF STRONG EXCITEMENT WITH HER HANDS CLASPED TIGHTLY TOGETHER BREATHING SHORT AND FLASHING FIRES OF INDIGNATION FROM HER EYES
LORD LOWBOROUGH WAS QUITE AS REMARKABLE FOR HIS ABSTEMIOUSNESS FOR SOME TIME BEFORE YOU MARRIED HIM AS HE IS NOW I HAVE HEARD OH ABOUT THE WINE YOU MEAN--YES HE'S SAFE ENOUGH FOR THAT
MR WILMOT IS TO BRING HIS NIECE AND HER COUSIN MILICENT
BUT GIVE ME THE POWER TO PROTECT YOU AND SHOW ME THE VILLAIN THAT DARES TO INSULT NO ONE HAS EVER DARED TO INSULT ME AS YOU ARE DOING NOW SAID I AT LENGTH RELEASING MY HANDS AND RECOILING FROM HIM
FOR ALL I'M TOO OLD TO BIDE THE THOUGHTS O LEAVING EM IN TROUBLE AND DANGER AND GOING AMONGST STRANGERS MYSELF THEN YOU SHA'N'T RACHEL CRIED I EMBRACING MY FAITHFUL FRIEND
MILICENT HARGRAVE IS TO BE ONE BRIDESMAID AND ANNABELLA WILMOT THE OTHER--NOT THAT I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF THE LATTER BUT SHE IS AN INTIMATE OF THE FAMILY AND I HAVE NOT ANOTHER FRIEND
WHEN MISS MYERS ARRIVED I WAS NOT PREPARED TO GIVE HER A VERY CORDIAL RECEPTION
BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN A CONSIDERABLE TIME
BUT PERHAPS SHE IS NOT AWARE THAT THE LADY'S CHARACTER IS CONSIDERED SCARCELY RESPECTABLE SHE IS NOT NOR AM I
SUCH VAIN PRESUMPTION WOULD BE RIGHTLY SERVED IF I SHOULD PERISH WITH HIM IN THE GULF FROM WHICH I SOUGHT TO SAVE HIM
BUT I PAID DEAR FOR THE GRATIFICATION
HE WILL REPORT WHAT HE HAS SEEN TO HUNTINGDON AND ALL THE REST WITH SUCH EMBELLISHMENTS AS HE THINKS PROPER
HE HAS BEEN SO EXTREMELY CEREMONIOUS AND STATELY OF LATE I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT UNLESS YOU HAVE DESPERATELY OFFENDED HIM
AND I BELIEVE I KNOW HOW FAR YOU ARE MISTAKEN IN YOUR OPINION
ARE YOU ANGRY BECAUSE MRS GRAHAM WOULD NOT LET YOU GO HOME WITH HER HE ASKED WITH A FAINT SMILE THAT NEARLY EXASPERATED ME BEYOND CONTROL
BUT MAY I ASK IT IS AN ACT OF VERY GREAT IMPERTINENCE SIR
IT IS THE LONDON AIR
HER HUSBAND HOWEVER UPON THIS SECOND MISDEMEANOUR IMMEDIATELY SOUGHT AND OBTAINED A DIVORCE AND NOT LONG AFTER MARRIED AGAIN
AND SITTING DOWN ON A LOW STOOL BEFORE THE EASY-CHAIR I SUNK MY HEAD UPON ITS CUSHIONED SEAT AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT UNTIL THE TEARS GUSHED OUT AGAIN AND I WEPT LIKE ANY CHILD
THEREFORE YOU NEED NOT KILL ME WITH THAT LOOK OF COLD AND PITILESS DISDAIN
BECAUSE A THOUGHT STRUCK ME THAT PERHAPS I MIGHT PREVENT IT--THAT IF I DID NOT SHE AND I MIGHT BOTH LAMENT IT TO THE LATEST MOMENT OF OUR LIVES
THE INCREASING HEIGHT AND BOLDNESS OF THE HILLS HAD FOR SOME TIME INTERCEPTED THE PROSPECT
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT NO SOONER WERE THE GUESTS DEPARTED THAN I WAS DOOMED TO A VERY SERIOUS REMONSTRANCE WHICH UNPLEASANTLY CHECKED THE GALLOPING COURSE OF MY SPIRITS AND MADE A DISAGREEABLE CLOSE TO THE EVENING
YOUR BRIGHT EYES ARE FADED AND THAT TENDER DELICATE BLOOM HAS QUITE DESERTED YOUR CHEEK THAT IS ONLY WITH TOO MUCH GAIETY AND FATIGUE IT IS NOT I TELL YOU
BUT PRESERVE ME FROM SUCH CORDIALITY
WHEN IT ROSE IN SIGHT I STOOD STILL A MOMENT TO LOOK AND THEN CONTINUED MOVING TOWARDS THE GLOOMY OBJECT OF ATTRACTION
THEN DRAWING A CANDLE CLOSE TO HIS ELBOW HE GATHERED ALL THE DRAWINGS TO HIMSELF AS WELL WHAT HE HAD SEEN AS THE OTHERS AND MUTTERING I MUST LOOK AT BOTH SIDES NOW HE EAGERLY COMMENCED AN EXAMINATION WHICH I WATCHED AT FIRST WITH TOLERABLE COMPOSURE IN THE CONFIDENCE THAT HIS VANITY WOULD NOT BE GRATIFIED BY ANY FURTHER DISCOVERIES
BUT I HOPE HELEN YOU WON'T THINK IT YOUR BOUNDEN DUTY TO COMPOSE YOUR FACE AND MANNERS INTO CONFORMITY WITH YOUR FUNEREAL GARB
WELL RESUMED ROSE
I'VE HEARD ALL ABOUT HIM
BUT IT IS A COMFORT TO SEE THERE IS AT LEAST ONE AMONG THEM WORTHY TO BE TRUSTED AND ESTEEMED
IF I HAPPENED TO BE ON HORSEBACK HE WAS SURE TO GET A CANTER OR A GALLOP
MOORLAND SCENE HAWORTH I HAD SUCCEEDED IN KILLING A HAWK AND TWO CROWS WHEN I CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF THE MANSION
WAIT A MOMENT LAWRENCE AND LET ME EXPLAIN MYSELF
IF MY KIND NEIGHBOURS GET TO KNOW OF THIS VISIT--AS NO DOUBT THEY WILL--THEY WILL NOT TURN IT MUCH TO MY ADVANTAGE IT WAS WITH WHAT THE VICAR WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE CALLED A SAVAGE SORT OF SMILE THAT SHE SAID THIS
IF IT IS TRUE THAT YOU TOLD HIM YOU COULD NOT ACCEPT HIS OFFER WITHOUT OUR CONSENT IT IS TRUE INTERRUPTED I
I WROTE TO THEM THE OTHER DAY TO TELL THEM OF MY HAPPY PROSPECTS AND NOW INSTEAD OF A BUNDLE OF CONGRATULATIONS I'VE GOT A POCKETFUL OF BITTER EXECRATIONS AND REPROACHES
FOR I HAD LEFT YOU APPARENTLY IN GREAT AFFLICTION AND I PARTLY BLAMED MY OWN WANT OF FORBEARANCE AND DISCRETION AS THE CAUSE OF IT
ONLY YESTERDAY AND DID YOU SEE HIM THERE YES--I SAW HIM WAS HE WELL YES--THAT IS SAID HE WITH INCREASING HESITATION AND AN APPEARANCE OF SUPPRESSED INDIGNATION HE WAS AS WELL AS--AS HE DESERVED TO BE BUT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES I SHOULD HAVE DEEMED INCREDIBLE FOR A MAN SO FAVOURED AS HE IS HE HERE LOOKED UP AND POINTED THE SENTENCE WITH A SERIOUS BOW TO ME
NOW SIR WHAT NEXT THIS QUESTION THOUGH UNSPOKEN WAS NOT LONG UNANSWERED
MARY MILLWARD WAS ANOTHER MUTE,--NOT SO MUCH TORMENTED WITH CRUEL KINDNESS AS DICK WILSON BECAUSE SHE HAD A CERTAIN SHORT DECIDED WAY OF ANSWERING AND REFUSING AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RATHER SULLEN THAN DIFFIDENT
HOW COULD YOU EXCLAIMED MY MOTHER
WILL YOU NOT FORGIVE ME THEN SAID HE
IF THEY CAN PART OUR BODIES IT IS ENOUGH
MRS HUNTINGDON EXPRESSED HERSELF GLAD TO SEE MILICENT ONCE MORE AND PLEASED TO BEHOLD HER SO HAPPY AND WELL
HE SUBSEQUENTLY EXPRESSED HIMSELF RATHER GLAD SHE WAS GONE
YOU HAVE DONE MORE FOR ME THAN THE MOST SKILFUL PHYSICIAN COULD DO
I'VE GIVEN UP GAMBLING AND I'LL GIVE UP THIS TOO HE WAS ON THE POINT OF DELIBERATELY POURING THE WHOLE CONTENTS OF THE BOTTLE ON TO THE TABLE BUT HARGRAVE WRESTED IT FROM HIM
HE APPEARS TO BE SENSIBLE OF HIS DANGER
YOU SUFFER THEM TO AFFECT YOUR DELICATE MIND TOO SENSIBLY
BUT WE MAY WRITE I TIMIDLY SUGGESTED
I FELT NO JOY BUT THAT HIS SISTER WAS AT LENGTH RELEASED FROM HER AFFLICTIVE OVERWHELMING TOIL--NO HOPE BUT THAT SHE WOULD IN TIME RECOVER FROM THE EFFECTS OF IT AND BE SUFFERED TO REST IN PEACE AND QUIETNESS AT LEAST FOR THE REMAINDER OF HER LIFE
MY DEAR GILBERT SAID SHE I WISH YOU WOULDN'T DO SO
AND BECAUSE IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING I WENT TO SHARE HIS EXILE FOR A LITTLE WHILE I WAS REPROACHED ON MY RETURN FOR PREFERRING MY CHILD TO MY HUSBAND
THERE WAS EVEN AN EASE AND CHEERFULNESS ABOUT HER AIR AND MANNER THAT I MADE NO PRETENSION TO
JOY UNSPEAKABLE THAT MY ADORED HELEN WAS ALL I WISHED TO THINK HER--THAT THROUGH THE NOISOME VAPOURS OF THE WORLD'S ASPERSIONS AND MY OWN FANCIED CONVICTIONS HER CHARACTER SHONE BRIGHT AND CLEAR AND STAINLESS AS THAT SUN I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOOK ON
THERE NOW I DECLARE YOU'RE CRYING
NO WAS THE ANSWER AND I SHUT THE DOOR AND DEPARTED
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT ME BUT THE SOLACE OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE AND A HOPEFUL TRUST IN HEAVEN AND YOU LABOUR CONTINUALLY TO ROB ME OF THESE
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY DUTY TO GO WITHOUT DELAY
AND ARTHUR WAS AT THE TABLE TURNING OVER A BOOK OF ENGRAVINGS
YOU LADIES MUST ALWAYS HAVE THE LAST WORD I SUPPOSE SAID I OBSERVING HER RISE AND BEGIN TO TAKE LEAVE OF MY MOTHER
THEY CAN'T TAKE SO MUCH AS A BOTTLE BETWEEN THEM WITHOUT ITS GETTING INTO THEIR HEADS YOU ARE POURING THE CREAM INTO YOUR SAUCER MR GRIMSBY AH
MILICENT DELIGHTED TO SEE HER HUSBAND HER BROTHER AND HER OVER-ESTIMATED FRIEND ACQUITTING THEMSELVES SO WELL WAS LIVELY AND GAY TOO IN HER QUIET WAY
WE FEEL AS CHILDREN AND WE UNDERSTAND AS CHILDREN
FOR JANE WILSON HAS SEEN HER
AND SETTING A CHAIR FOR MRS GRAHAM ON ONE SIDE OF THE HEARTH AND ONE FOR MYSELF ON THE OTHER I VENTURED TO SIT DOWN THOUGH HALF SUSPECTING SHE WOULD RATHER SEE ME GO
NOW MR MARKHAM SAID SHE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE CALMNESS I MUST TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT I CANNOT DO WITH THIS
MY HEAD IS SO HAUNTED WITH THE RECOLLECTIONS OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS THAT I CANNOT ATTEND TO THEM
AND IF THAT ILLUSTRATION WILL NOT MOVE YOU HERE IS ANOTHER:--WE ARE CHILDREN NOW
BUT SUPPOSING IT SHOULD HOW ARE YOU PREPARED TO MEET THE EVENT WHY THE DOCTOR TOLD ME I WASN'T TO THINK ABOUT IT FOR I WAS SURE TO GET BETTER IF I STUCK TO HIS REGIMEN AND PRESCRIPTIONS I HOPE YOU MAY ARTHUR
THEN FOR ONE MOMENT I PAUSED TO INHALE ONE DRAUGHT OF THAT COOL BRACING AIR AND VENTURE ONE LOOK BACK UPON THE HOUSE
WHAT IS THE MATTER MARKHAM WHISPERED HE
IT WAS NOT MY HELEN
IT'S NOTHING--EXCEPT AS YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE IT A SUBJECT OF ACCUSATION AND DISTRESS WHAT WOULD LORD LOWBOROUGH YOUR FRIEND THINK IF HE KNEW ALL
I HAVE IT NOW BEFORE ME
AS THE USUAL HOUR OF RETIREMENT APPROACHED I DRIED MY EYES AND TRIED TO CLEAR MY VOICE AND CALM MY MIND
NO WELL I THINK YOU'RE BETTER WITHOUT HIM SURE ENOUGH--FOR MY PART I'M DOWNRIGHT WEARY OF HIM
WHEN I SPOKE OF ORDERING MY MOURNING HE EXCLAIMED,--'OH I HATE BLACK
THE BROAD EXPANSE OF WATER SLEEPING IN FROZEN QUIET
BUT ALL OUR TALENTS INCREASE IN THE USING AND EVERY FACULTY BOTH GOOD AND BAD STRENGTHENS BY EXERCISE
WHAT RIGHT HAD HE TO ASK ANY ONE BEFORE ME HELEN WHAT DID MY UNCLE SAY HE SAID HE WOULD NOT INTERFERE IN THE MATTER
THEN I WILL AND SMILING ALMOST FRANKLY HE STEPPED FORWARD AND OFFERED HIS HAND
LEAVING HIM THUS EMPLOYED I TOOK MY CANDLE AND SLIPPING QUIETLY FROM THE ROOM HASTENED UP-STAIRS AS FAST AS I COULD
I HAD BEEN BOLD ENOUGH ALREADY AND THIS PREMATURE OFFERING HAD WELL-NIGH GIVEN THE DEATH-BLOW TO MY HOPES
BUT IF I HAVE A FEW FRIENDS OF COURSE I AM GLAD TO SEE THEM OCCASIONALLY
DO BE QUIET ALL OF YOU
HE BROUGHT BACK INTELLIGENCE THAT THE YOUNG SQUIRE WAS LAID UP WITH THE COMPLICATED EVILS OF A BROKEN HEAD AND CERTAIN CONTUSIONS OCCASIONED BY A FALL--OF WHICH HE DID NOT TROUBLE HIMSELF TO RELATE THE PARTICULARS--AND THE SUBSEQUENT MISCONDUCT OF HIS HORSE AND A SEVERE COLD THE CONSEQUENCE OF LYING ON THE WET GROUND IN THE RAIN
I SHOULD NOT DISCLOSE MY PLACE OF REFUGE EVEN TO HER IN ORDER THAT SHE AND MY UNCLE MIGHT BE ABLE WITH TRUTH TO DENY ALL KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING IT
I AM TIRED OUT WITH HIS INJUSTICE HIS SELFISHNESS AND HOPELESS DEPRAVITY
INDEED HE SCARCELY SPOKE AT ALL EXCEPT TO MAKE KNOWN HIS WANTS AND HARDLY THEN
SHE WAS MUCH AS USUAL
IT WAS THE FORMAL KNOCKING AT THE DOOR WITH THE PROSPECT OF BEING GRAVELY USHERED IN BY RACHEL TO THE PRESENCE OF A SURPRISED UNCORDIAL MISTRESS THAT SO GREATLY DISTURBED ME
I WAS WRONG TO FORGET MYSELF AND YOU AS I DID
AS MUCH INDEED AS HE DESIRED TO HAVE--BUT INTO EVERY GLASS I SURREPTITIOUSLY INTRODUCED A SMALL QUANTITY OF TARTAR-EMETIC JUST ENOUGH TO PRODUCE INEVITABLE NAUSEA AND DEPRESSION WITHOUT POSITIVE SICKNESS
HOWEVER I DETERMINED TO BE COOL AND CIVIL
AND THIS NIGHT YOU KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WHAT YOU WERE DOING WELL I'M SORRY FOR IT REPLIED HE WITH MORE OF SULKINESS THAN CONTRITION
AND IF YOU WILL WAIT TILL THE SETTLED FINE WEATHER COMES I'M SURE WE SHALL ALL BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU AMONGST US POOR MRS GRAHAM LOOKED DISMAYED AND ATTEMPTED TO MAKE EXCUSES BUT ROSE EITHER COMPASSIONATING HER LONELY LIFE OR ANXIOUS TO CULTIVATE HER ACQUAINTANCE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE HER
AND FOR MANY DAYS I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AND LONGING IN VAIN FOR A LETTER
AND THEN I ALLOW IT ENRAGES ME PAST BEARING ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M NOT MY OWN MAN AS IS NO DOUBT GENERALLY THE CASE ON SUCH OCCASIONS SAID I
CHAPTER LI WE WILL NOW TURN TO A CERTAIN STILL COLD CLOUDY AFTERNOON ABOUT THE COMMENCEMENT OF DECEMBER WHEN THE FIRST FALL OF SNOW LAY THINLY SCATTERED OVER THE BLIGHTED FIELDS AND FROZEN ROADS OR STORED MORE THICKLY IN THE HOLLOWS OF THE DEEP CART-RUTS AND FOOTSTEPS OF MEN AND HORSES IMPRESSED IN THE NOW PETRIFIED MIRE OF LAST MONTH'S DRENCHING RAINS
BUT IT WOULD BE WRONG TO TALK OF IT NOW IT WAS WRONG TO TALK OF IT THEN GILBERT
IF YOU DON'T VALUE ME I MUST TURN TO SOMEBODY THAT WILL I THOUGHT IT WAS PARTLY IN JEST--A HALF-PLAYFUL MIXTURE OF MOCK RESIGNATION AND PRETENDED INDIFFERENCE
YES YES CRIED SHE EAGERLY STARTING UP FROM HER RECLINING POSTURE
I MADE A MOVEMENT TO LET HIM KNOW THAT HE WAS NOT ALONE
BUT YOU NEEDN'T DISTURB YOURSELF ABOUT THAT MR LAWRENCE FOR I'VE SEEN THE LAST OF HER THE LAST
BUT YOU HAVE TALENTS ARTHUR--NATURAL ENDOWMENTS BOTH OF HEART AND MIND AND TEMPER SUCH AS MANY A BETTER CHRISTIAN WOULD BE GLAD TO POSSESS IF YOU WOULD ONLY EMPLOY THEM IN GOD'S SERVICE
SHE IS A WICKED WOMAN I SAID
BUT I DEVOURED THOSE PRECIOUS LETTERS WITH MY EYES AND NEVER LET THEM GO TILL THEIR CONTENTS WERE STAMPED UPON MY MIND
AND PERHAPS IF I DID SO THE RESULT WOULD NOT BE VERY CREDITABLE TO MY DISPOSITION
DON'T LET HIM TREAT YOUR SISTER IN THAT WAY SAID I TO MR HARGRAVE
MOORLAND SCENE HAWORTH TO FACE P 14 WITH WATER 46 WITH COTTAGE 100 BLAKE HALL GRASSDALE MANOR
AND WHEN AT THE LAST STAGE I WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE REINS INTO MY OWN HAND THEY ALL WITH ONE ACCORD OPPOSED IT
TILL FINDING HE WAS INDEED IMPENETRABLE SHE SUDDENLY REMITTED HER EFFORTS AND BECAME TO ALL APPEARANCE AS PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT AS HIMSELF
CAN I LOVE A MAN THAT DOES SUCH THINGS AND COOLLY MAINTAINS IT IS NOTHING YOU ARE BREAKING YOUR MARRIAGE VOWS YOURSELF SAID HE INDIGNANTLY RISING AND PACING TO AND FRO
AND THE WORSE HE IS I SUPPOSE THE MORE YOU LONG TO DELIVER HIM FROM HIMSELF YES PROVIDED HE IS NOT INCORRIGIBLE--THAT IS THE MORE I LONG TO DELIVER HIM FROM HIS FAULTS--TO GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF SHAKING OFF THE ADVENTITIOUS EVIL GOT FROM CONTACT WITH OTHERS WORSE THAN HIMSELF AND SHINING OUT IN THE UNCLOUDED LIGHT OF HIS OWN GENUINE GOODNESS--TO DO MY UTMOST TO HELP HIS BETTER SELF AGAINST HIS WORSE AND MAKE HIM WHAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF HE HAD NOT FROM THE BEGINNING HAD A BAD SELFISH MISERLY FATHER WHO TO GRATIFY HIS OWN SORDID PASSIONS RESTRICTED HIM IN THE MOST INNOCENT ENJOYMENTS OF CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH AND SO DISGUSTED HIM WITH EVERY KIND OF RESTRAINT;--AND A FOOLISH MOTHER WHO INDULGED HIM TO THE TOP OF HIS BENT DECEIVING HER HUSBAND FOR HIM AND DOING HER UTMOST TO ENCOURAGE THOSE GERMS OF FOLLY AND VICE IT WAS HER DUTY TO SUPPRESS,--AND THEN SUCH A SET OF COMPANIONS AS YOU REPRESENT HIS FRIENDS TO BE POOR MAN SAID SHE SARCASTICALLY HIS KIND HAVE
SHE THOUGHT IT A POOR RETURN FOR WALTER'S GENEROUS CONCESSION AND WAS DISAPPOINTED IN HER FRIEND
I AM SIR
WHAT NEXT SIR HOW LONG IS IT SINCE YOU SAW HIM WHO GAVE YOU THE RIGHT TO CATECHIZE ME ON THIS OR ANY OTHER SUBJECT OH NO ONE!--IT'S QUITE AT YOUR OPTION WHETHER TO ANSWER OR NOT
SHE WAS NOT SET APART AS THEY WERE BY THE LONELY AND SELF-SUFFICING ACTIVITIES OF GREAT POWERS
WHETHER I OR HE SHOULD FALL OR BOTH IT WOULD BE AN INEXPRESSIBLE RELIEF TO ME IF JUST SO
I LOOKED AT HIS FACE TO SEE IF THAT WAS THE CASE NOW
NO MORE I DO MY DEAR
REMEMBER MY GUARDIANS
I KNEW THAT HAND THOUGH A BLACK GLOVE CONCEALED ITS DELICATE WHITENESS AND HALF ITS FAIR PROPORTIONS AND QUICKLY SEIZING IT I PRESSED IT IN MY OWN--ARDENTLY FOR A MOMENT BUT INSTANTLY RECOLLECTING MYSELF I DROPPED IT AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY WITHDRAWN
THAT'S A MODE OF SELF-TORMENT I NEVER WAS MUCH ADDICTED TO
I MUST LOSE HIM FOR EVER AND ANNABELLA MAY WIN HIM AND TRIUMPH AS SHE WILL
PRAY LET HIM STAY
IN TAKING THIS UP TO BRING IT TO THE LIGHT I DISCOVERED ANOTHER BEHIND IT WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
HE HAS BEEN DECENTLY TEMPERATE AT TABLE AND WELL-CONDUCTED TOWARDS LADY LOWBOROUGH
AND IF I HAD LOVED AND REVERENCED HER LESS TO BEGIN WITH THE PREFERENCE MIGHT HAVE GRATIFIED AND AMUSED ME
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME ALL-NO MATTER HOW BITTERLY
AND YET I WAS READY TO RESOLVE UPON THE ATTEMPT
I WAS GLAD OF THIS PROOF OF DISINTERESTED AFFECTION
CHAPTER XXXVIII DECEMBER 20TH 1826.--THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF MY WEDDING-DAY AND I TRUST THE LAST I SHALL SPEND UNDER THIS ROOF
BUT NOW FOR VERY OBSTINACY'S SAKE I WILL STAND OUT A BAD MOTIVE FOR A GOOD RESOLVE I ANSWERED
LET ME SEEK ONCE MORE TO DISSIPATE REFLECTION IN THE MINOR DETAILS OF PASSING EVENTS
AT LAST HIS PATIENCE WAS TIRED OUT
HE MUST GO ON TILL HE HAD RETRIEVED THAT LAST MISFORTUNE AT LEAST
WHY NOT MAY I ASK SHE REPELLED MY MOCKING SMILE WITH A GLANCE OF SCORNFUL INDIGNATION
IT WOULD INDEED BE A JUST PUNISHMENT AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED IF PROVIDENCE SHOULD TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD AND MAKE YOU FEEL WHAT OTHERS FEEL THAT SHE PAUSED AS A SUDDEN BURST OF LOUD TALKING AND LAUGHTER REACHED US FROM THE DINING-ROOM IN WHICH THE VOICE OF HATTERSLEY WAS PRE-EMINENTLY CONSPICUOUS EVEN TO MY UNPRACTISED EAR
WHAT'S TO DO WITH YOU NOW SAID HE WHEN THE REMOVAL OF THE SECOND COURSE GAVE HIM TIME TO LOOK ABOUT HIM
AS HONEST-HEARTED AND AS GUILELESS AND SIMPLE AS HER SISTER BUT WITH A FEARLESS SPIRIT OF HER OWN THAT I FANCY HER MOTHER WILL FIND SOME DIFFICULTY IN BENDING TO HER PURPOSES
AND THEN I MUST HAVE MONEY FOR THE JOURNEY THE PASSAGE AND SOME LITTLE TO SUPPORT US IN OUR RETREAT IN CASE I SHOULD BE UNSUCCESSFUL AT FIRST
I'VE MY BITS O SAVINGS YET AND IF YOU WOULDN'T TAKE ME I SHOULD HAVE TO FIND MY OWN BOARD AND LODGING OUT OF EM SOMEWHERE OR ELSE WORK AMONG STRANGERS
THROUGH HIM I WAS AT ONCE DELIVERED FROM ALL FORMALITY AND TERROR AND CONSTRAINT
HOW ODD IT IS THAT WE SO OFTEN WEEP FOR EACH OTHER'S DISTRESSES WHEN WE SHED NOT A TEAR FOR OUR OWN
ARE YOU GOING ALREADY SAID SHE TAKING THE HAND I OFFERED AND NOT IMMEDIATELY LETTING IT GO
WHAT DO YOU LOOK SO SULKY FOR
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT SHE TOOK UP THE CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BEAUTIFYING WITH A DEEP LACE BORDER AND BEGAN TO BE VERY BUSY
BUT LEAVE ME WHOEVER YOU ARE
TO EFFECT THIS I HAD ONLY TO DROP THE SEED INTO THE GROUND AND IT WOULD SOON BECOME A STATELY BRANCHING HERB
NOTHING OBLITERATE THEM!--NOTHING NOTHING HE REPEATED IN A WHISPER WHOSE DESPAIRING BITTERNESS PRECLUDED ALL RESENTMENT
AND ALL THAT SEEMED UNACCOUNTABLE IN YOUR POSITION I TRUSTED THAT YOU COULD ACCOUNT FOR IF YOU CHOSE MRS GRAHAM HAD DISCONTINUED HER WALK
AND WAS THIS THE DREADFUL SECRET HE HAD WISHED TO REVEAL TO ME
FOR IT'S MY BELIEF THEY NEVER DID YOU MUCH GOOD MAYBE NOT
SINCE YOU WILL MISTAKE HER SILENCE FOR INDIFFERENCE COME WITH ME AND I'LL SHOW YOU ONE OR TWO OF HER LETTERS--NO BREACH OF CONFIDENCE I HOPE SINCE YOU ARE HER OTHER HALF HE FOLLOWED ME INTO THE LIBRARY
I CALL THAT AN UNCHRISTIAN SPIRIT NOW SAID THE VILLAIN
NEVERTHELESS IT IS QUITE TRUE
I FORCED MYSELF TO ENDURE IT FOR A WHILE FEARING A CONTRADICTION MIGHT DISTURB HIM TOO MUCH
I AM SURPRISED
WASN'T IT PROVOKING I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU WOULD FEEL IT SO BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IF YOU MARRIED HIM YOU MIGHT HAVE MORE REASON TO REGRET IT HEREAFTER THAN IF YOU MARRIED MR OLDFIELD
A SPLENDID MORNING IT WAS
ONLY DON'T SAY THAT THIS MEETING IS TO BE OUR LAST AND WHY NOT
AND YOUR WIFE IS FIFTY TIMES TOO GOOD FOR YOU YOU KNOW AND HE ADDED SOME PRAISE OF YOU WHICH YOU WOULD NOT THANK ME FOR REPEATING NOR HIM FOR UTTERING
DEIGN TO SMILE ON ME AND I AM HAPPY
THE PONY HAD WANDERED EIGHT OR TEN YARDS FURTHER AWAY
AT LENGTH HOWEVER THE BOISTEROUS PASTIME TERMINATED SUDDENLY AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED
IS IT THAT YOU THINK SHE HAS NO VIRTUE ASSUREDLY NOT WELL BUT YOU AFFIRM THAT VIRTUE IS ONLY ELICITED BY TEMPTATION;--AND YOU THINK THAT A WOMAN CANNOT BE TOO LITTLE EXPOSED TO TEMPTATION OR TOO LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH VICE OR ANYTHING CONNECTED THEREWITH
IT WAS A LONG JOURNEY TO STANINGLEY FOR THOSE SLOW-TRAVELLING DAYS BUT I DID NOT DENY MYSELF NEEDFUL REFRESHMENT ON THE ROAD NOR EVEN A NIGHT'S REST AT A WAYSIDE INN CHOOSING RATHER TO BROOK A LITTLE DELAY THAN TO PRESENT MYSELF WORN WILD AND WEATHER-BEATEN BEFORE MY MISTRESS AND HER AUNT WHO WOULD BE ASTONISHED ENOUGH TO SEE ME WITHOUT THAT
BUT IT ISN'T SO WHEN YOU THINK OF IT WELL BUT LAWRENCE IS A GOOD RIDER
I DON'T SAY MUCH TO ARTHUR ABOUT IT FOR IF I DID IT WOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD
SHE CAN'T PUT ON LIFE UNLESS SHE SEES HALF A DOZEN FRESH GOWNS AND BONNETS A DAY--NOT TO SPEAK OF THE FACES WITHIN
BUT I'M NOT CROSS
FOR HE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN I WAS SUFFERING TORTURES OF ANXIETY FOR HER AND UNCERTAINTY FOR MY OWN FUTURE PROSPECTS
INCREASE OF LOVE BRINGS INCREASE OF HAPPINESS WHEN IT IS MUTUAL AND PURE AS THAT WILL BE BUT CAN YOU HELEN CONTEMPLATE WITH DELIGHT THIS PROSPECT OF LOSING ME IN A SEA OF GLORY I OWN I CANNOT
FOR THOUGH VEXED AT FIRST AT HER UNAMIABLE SPIRIT HER FRANKNESS TOUCHED ME AND THE CONTRAST BETWEEN OUR SITUATIONS WAS SUCH THAT I COULD WELL AFFORD TO PITY HER AND WISH HER WELL
ONCE OR TWICE I LENT HER A BOOK AND ONCE SHE LENT ME ONE IN RETURN
I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS--BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS SPOT I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS PERFIDIOUS DUPLICITY I SHALL ANSWER NO QUESTIONS TILL YOU LET GO THE BRIDLE,--IF YOU STAND TILL MORNING NOW THEN SAID I UNCLOSING MY HAND BUT STILL STANDING BEFORE HIM
WE CAME HERE TO SEEK RETIREMENT OURSELVES NOT TO INTRUDE ON YOUR SECLUSION I AM NO HERMIT MRS GRAHAM--THOUGH I OWN IT LOOKS RATHER LIKE IT TO ABSENT MYSELF IN THIS UNCOURTEOUS FASHION FROM MY GUESTS I FEARED YOU WERE UNWELL SAID SHE WITH A LOOK OF REAL CONCERN
AT LENGTH TO MY JOY THE VICTORY SEEMED INCLINING TO MY SIDE
ISN'T IT A SHAME MRS HUNTINGDON CRIED HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW
ON ENTERING THE PARLOUR I FOUND ELIZA THERE WITH ROSE AND NO ONE ELSE
YOU WILL SERIOUSLY DISPLEASE ME IF YOU DO
AS WELL TO BETTER YOUR MIND AS TO ALLEVIATE YOUR PRESENT SUFFERINGS
THEY PERSUADED HER TO STAY WITH THEM THE REST OF THE DAY MRS HARGRAVE PROMISING TO BRING HER BACK IN THE EVENING AND REMAIN TILL THE PARTY BROKE UP ON THE MORROW
OR WHEN SHE LOOKS FLAT AND WANTS SHAKING UP A BIT
WILL YOU ALLOW ME SHE BRIDLED HER LONG NECK AND SMILED AND SUFFERED HIM TO LEAD HER TO THE INSTRUMENT WHERE SHE PLAYED AND SANG IN HER VERY BEST STYLE ONE PIECE AFTER ANOTHER
NOW NELL SAID HE THIS YOUNG HUNTINGDON HAS BEEN ASKING FOR YOU
IT WAS ANNE'S SOLE JOURNEY TO LONDON--HER ONLY CONTACT WITH A WORLD THAT WAS NOT HAWORTH EXCEPT THAT SUPPLIED BY HER SCHOOL-LIFE AT ROEHEAD AND HER TWO TEACHING ENGAGEMENTS
BUT YOU ARE ANGRY BECAUSE IT WAS TO ME THAT ANNABELLA CONFESSED HER LACK OF ESTEEM FOR HER LOVER NO ARTHUR IT IS NOT THAT THAT DISPLEASES ME
MY PROSPECTS ARE DARKENED
SEE IF THAT'LL SETTLE YOU CRIED HATTERSLEY SNATCHING UP A FOOTSTOOL AND HURTING IT AT THE HEAD OF HIS HOST
AND I WISH YOU WOULD MAKE THE LIKE EXERTIONS CONTINUED HE
AND IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE WRONGED ME BY GIVING ME YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND OCCASIONALLY ADMITTING ME TO THE ENJOYMENT OF YOUR COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WHEN ALL HOPES OF CLOSER INTIMACY WERE VAIN--AS INDEED YOU ALWAYS GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND--IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE WRONGED ME BY THIS YOU ARE MISTAKEN
SOON HOWEVER THIS CHAOS OF THOUGHTS AND PASSIONS CLEARED AWAY GIVING PLACE TO TWO DISTINCT EMOTIONS
AND THE POOR MAN WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED AND HURT AT YOUR SUDDEN EXPLOSION POOR MAN INDEED
FOR I REALLY HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO PAINT
NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MR GRIMSBY AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MR HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENIOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON TO OTHER MEN'S SHOULDERS
SO I MUST EXPECT TO PAY FOR IT IN SOME SHAPE YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY A HIGHER PRICE THAN YOU ANTICIPATE IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE
HAVING NO DAUGHTER TO MARRY SHE THOUGHT IT AS WELL TO STAY AT HOME AND ECONOMISE
I MUST SEE ARTHUR TO-NIGHT AND SPEAK TO HIM
AND THAT IN FACT NOTHING WOULD ANSWER BUT THIS UNLESS I FLED THE COUNTRY AS I HAD INTENDED BEFORE
ROSE HAD NEITHER THE DISCRIMINATION NOR THE VIRULENCE TO REGARD THE LITTLE DEMON AS I DID AND THEY STILL PRESERVED THEIR FORMER INTIMACY
THE OLD VIRGIN HAD CONSTITUTED HERSELF THE GUARDIAN OF HER LADY'S HONOUR I SUPPOSE AND DOUBTLESS SHE SAW IN ME ANOTHER MR HARGRAVE ONLY THE MORE DANGEROUS IN BEING MORE ESTEEMED AND TRUSTED BY HER MISTRESS
I WON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK OF ME SHE TURNED AWAY AND I WENT
TO TAKE A WALK WAS THE REPLY
MY CHILD MUST NOT BE ABANDONED TO THIS CORRUPTION
YOU'VE NEARLY SQUEEZED THE BREATH OUT OF MY BODY HE PRESSED HIS HAND TO HIS HEART AND LOOKED REALLY AGITATED AND ILL
THERE NOW GO
AND YOU CAN ENJOY IT WITH SUCH A QUIET CONSCIENCE TOO BECAUSE IT'S ALL IN THE WAY OF DUTY IT IS WELL FOR ME THAT I AM DOING MY DUTY SAID I WITH A BITTERNESS I COULD NOT REPRESS FOR IT IS THE ONLY COMFORT I HAVE
ADIEU THEN DEAR HELEN FOREVER
SHE CLOSED THE DOOR AND WALKED UP TO THE FIRE
AND THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF WILL CEASE TO PESTER YOU WITH HIS ADDRESSES IF HE FINDS THEM STEADILY REJECTED OH NO
AND IT MIGHT BE DEEMED PRESUMPTION IN ME TO OFFER MY HAND TO THE FORMER BY THE WORLD BY HER FRIENDS IF NOT BY HERSELF
IN EVERY LETTER HE PROMISES TO BE WITH ME IN A FEW DAYS AND EVERY TIME DECEIVES ME OR DECEIVES HIMSELF
I'LL ASK HIM MYSELF SAID I ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM
THERE'LL BE NO SHOOTING TO-DAY I GUESS THEN SUDDENLY LIFTING UP HIS VOICE HE REGALED US WITH A FEW BARS OF A ROLLICKING SONG WHICH ABRUPTLY CEASING HE FINISHED THE TUNE WITH A WHISTLE AND THEN CONTINUED:--'I SAY MRS HUNTINGDON WHAT A FINE STUD YOUR HUSBAND HAS
THE MEASURE OF MISCONSTRUCTION AND ABUSE THEREFORE WHICH HER BOOK BROUGHT UPON HER SHE BORE SAYS HER SISTER AS IT WAS HER CUSTOM TO BEAR WHATEVER WAS UNPLEASANT WITH MILD STEADY PATIENCE
BLAKE HALL--THE APPROACH GRASSDALE MANOR AS FOR PARIS WE ONLY JUST TOUCHED AT THAT AND HE WOULD NOT GIVE ME TIME TO SEE ONE-TENTH OF THE BEAUTIES AND INTERESTING OBJECTS OF ROME
BUT SHE WILL NOT OBLIGE YOU TO TAKE IT!--I DARESAY YOU WILL DO VERY WELL WITHOUT
HE DID NOT SIT NEAR ME AT DINNER
IF HE TOLD THE TRUTH I WOULD BEAR IT AS BEST I COULD
AND BECAUSE IF YOU STAY YOUR CONDUCT CANNOT POSSIBLY REMAIN CONCEALED MUCH LONGER FROM THE ONLY TWO PERSONS IN THE HOUSE WHO DO NOT KNOW IT ALREADY
I KNOW HE DOES NOT DESERVE IT
HIS FRIEND HARGRAVE WITH A PRUDENCE AND SELF-GOVERNMENT THAT I ENVY FOR HIM NEVER DISGRACES HIMSELF BY TAKING MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO RENDER HIM A LITTLE ELEVATED AND IS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO LEAVE THE TABLE AFTER LORD LOWBOROUGH WHO WISER STILL PERSEVERES IN VACATING THE DINING-ROOM IMMEDIATELY AFTER US
AND I WAS GETTING TO FEEL QUITE A GOOD BOY BUT MY MISCHIEVOUS BROTHER WHO WAS IDLING ABOUT THE ROOM REVIVED MY CORRUPTION BY SUDDENLY CALLING OUT,--'DON'T TOUCH HIM MOTHER
YES SHE'S GONE WAS HIS ANSWER SO CALMLY SPOKEN THAT MY TERROR WAS AT ONCE REMOVED
AND THOUGH SHE LEADS A RETIRED AND CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE SHE IS APT TO GET LOW-SPIRITED IF LEFT TOO MUCH ALONE BY ALL MEANS DEAREST HELEN!--DO WHAT YOU WILL WITH YOUR OWN
ON THE CONTRARY I SHALL DO MY UTMOST TO CONCEAL IT FROM HER
AND PERHAPS I CAN MANAGE TO DO WITHOUT YOU AS WELL AS YOUR POOR DESERTED FRIENDS BLESS YOU NO MURMURED HE
MY BRAIN SWAM ROUND
WHO BETRAYED HER SHE WENT OF HER OWN ACCORD IMPOSSIBLE LAWRENCE
AND I SHOULD RECEIVE ALL YOUR KINDNESS AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH I OWE YOU AH
MY DEEP ANXIETY AND SERIOUS PREOCCUPATION COULD NOT BE CONCEALED FROM HER MATERNAL EYES
BUT CONSIDER WELL BEFORE YOU GO
AND NOW FREDERICK I THINK I MAY BRING MY LETTER TO A CLOSE
WHEN I TRIED MILD PERSUASION HE WAS A LITTLE MORE GENTLE IN HIS REPLIES AND PROMISED TO RETURN
I SOUGHT IN AGONY SOME MEANS OF ESCAPE
IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR HE CAME TO THE DOOR AND FIRST HE TRIED THE HANDLE THEN HE KNOCKED
BUT IF IT SHOULD BURN ITSELF OUT AND LEAVE NOTHING BUT ASHES BEHIND WHAT SHALL I DO
DEAR HELEN HE SAID--'WHY DO YOU CRY
BUT STILL I COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK THAT WE HAD PARTED FOR THE LAST TIME WITH SO MUCH UNKINDNESS AND MISERY ON BOTH SIDES
I FELT LIKE A CRIMINAL
CHAPTER XLVII ONE MORNING ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER WHILE I WAS INDITING SOME BUSINESS LETTERS SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST ELIZA MILLWARD CAME TO CALL UPON MY SISTER
TO REPRESENT A BAD THING IN ITS LEAST OFFENSIVE LIGHT IS DOUBTLESS THE MOST AGREEABLE COURSE FOR A WRITER OF FICTION TO PURSUE
MR LAWRENCE AND I WERE ON TOLERABLY INTIMATE TERMS
I DID NOT EMERGE FROM MY PLACE OF CONCEALMENT TILL SHE HAD NEARLY REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE WALK LEST MY APPEARANCE SHOULD DRIVE HER AWAY
BUT MY FEARS WERE BROUGHT TO AN END IN A MANNER I HAD NOT ANTICIPATED
THEN WHILE THE COMPANY WERE HANGING OVER THE FIRE OR LOITERING THROUGH THE ROOM PREVIOUS TO SETTLING TO THEIR VARIOUS MORNING AVOCATIONS HE CAME AND LEANT OVER THE BACK OF MY CHAIR WITH HIS FACE IN CONTACT WITH MY CURLS AND COMMENCING WITH A QUIET LITTLE KISS POURED FORTH THE FOLLOWING COMPLAINTS INTO MY EAR HELEN YOU WITCH DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE ENTAILED UPON ME THE CURSES OF ALL MY FRIENDS
IT'S ONLY PROPER YOU KNOW OF COURSE MY DEAR
IT'S OLD MAXWELL'S I SUPPOSE IT WAS HIS SIR
I'LL SUBMIT--FOR ONCE IN A WAY.--COME MY LADS YOU MUST LOOK SHARP
FOR I NEVER LEAVE HIM ALONE
I WASN'T BORN FOR IT AND I CANNOT BEAR IT WHAT CAN'T BE CURED MUST BE ENDURED SAID I BEGINNING TO MIX THE FIFTH
THESE ORDERS WERE IMMEDIATELY COUNTERMANDED AND OVERRULED BY HIS FATHER
ALMOST AS MUCH ALARMED AT HER VEHEMENCE AS ASHAMED OF MY OWN MISCONDUCT
AND I COULD DO NOTHING TO LESSEN THEM--NAY IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF I HAD BROUGHT THEM UPON HER MYSELF BY MY OWN SECRET DESIRES
I SO SELDOM SEE YOU NOW FOR YOU NEVER COME TO THE VICARAGE
IT IS HIS WILL THAT WE SHOULD NOT INJURE OTHERS BY THE GRATIFICATION OF OUR OWN EARTHLY PASSIONS
I WENT DOWN TO DINNER RESOLVING TO BE CHEERFUL AND WELL-CONDUCTED AND KEPT MY RESOLUTION VERY CREDITABLY CONSIDERING HOW MY HEAD ACHED AND HOW INTERNALLY WRETCHED I FELT
I MERELY HONOURED HER WITH A CARELESS SALUTATION AND A FEW WORDS OF COURSE AND THEN WENT ON WITH MY WRITING LEAVING MY BROTHER TO BE MORE POLITE IF HE CHOSE
IF FALSE TOO GROSS AN INSULT
AND SHOULD BE QUITE CONTENTED TO SPEND MY LIFE IN OBSCURITY DEVOTING MYSELF TO THE TRAINING UP OF MY CHILD AND TEACHING HIM TO AVOID THE ERRORS OF BOTH HIS PARENTS
OH HATTERSLEY
MARRIAGE MAY CHANGE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE BETTER BUT IN MY PRIVATE OPINION IT IS FAR MORE LIKELY TO PRODUCE A CONTRARY RESULT SO THINKS MILICENT
HIS FRIEND ESPOUSED MY CAUSE
AND TILL PEOPLE CAN PROVE THEIR SLANDEROUS ACCUSATIONS I WILL NOT BELIEVE THEM
IF THEY HAVEN'T A FRIEND TO TALK TO THEY MUST WHISPER THEIR SECRETS TO THE FISHES OR WRITE THEM ON THE SAND OR SOMETHING
I REMEMBER IT WELL FOR I WAS WALKING HOME FROM THE VICARAGE WITH NO LESS REMARKABLE A PERSONAGE THAN MISS ELIZA MILLWARD BY MY SIDE
DOES THE IDEA OF DEATH APPAL YOU VERY MUCH IT'S JUST THE ONLY THING I CAN'T BEAR TO THINK OF
THE COUNTY TOWN WHERE SHE LIVED AND STILL LIVES I SUPPOSE IN A KIND OF CLOSE-FISTED COLD UNCOMFORTABLE GENTILITY DOING NO GOOD TO OTHERS AND BUT LITTLE TO HERSELF
IT WAS A VIOLATION OF HER SACRED DUTIES AS A WIFE AND A TEMPTING OF PROVIDENCE BY LAYING HERSELF OPEN TO TEMPTATION
AT LAST WE BEGAN TO ASCEND A TERRIBLY STEEP AND STONY LANE WHICH IN SPITE OF THE DARKNESS RACHEL SAID SHE REMEMBERED WELL
HE UTTERED A SUPPRESSED EXCLAMATION OF CONSTERNATION AND DISMAY AND MUTTERING I SHALL CATCH IT NOW SET DOWN HIS CANDLE ON THE NEAREST CHAIR AND REARING HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL STOOD CONFRONTING ME WITH FOLDED ARMS
DEC
AS I INTEND TO BE TAKEN FOR A WIDOW I THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE TO ENTER MY NEW ABODE IN MOURNING
I SHOULD NOT CARE IF I COULD SEE ANY PROSPECT OF BEING ABLE TO LOVE AND ADMIRE HIM BUT I CAN'T
SHE TOLD ME ALL
NOT YOU SAID I
TRUST ME AND YOU SHALL BE HAPPY ALSO FOR IF YOU ARE A WOMAN I CAN MAKE YOU SO--AND I WILL DO IT IN SPITE OF YOURSELF HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
HARGRAVE AND GRIMSBY
YES YOU HAVE DONE ME AN INJURY YOU CAN NEVER REPAIR--OR ANY OTHER EITHER--YOU HAVE BLIGHTED THE FRESHNESS AND PROMISE OF YOUTH AND MADE MY LIFE A WILDERNESS
HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED IT'S NOTHING CRIED I READY TO STAMP WITH VEXATION BECAUSE THE CANDLE WOULD NOT LIGHT
BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE OFFENDED HELEN FOR YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SPEAK MY MIND AND YOU MAY SPEAK YOURS TOO
NONSENSE FERGUS
HE HAD ALREADY LEFT HIS NEW COMPANION AND BEEN STANDING FOR SOME TIME BESIDE HIS MOTHER'S KNEE LOOKING UP INTO HER FACE AND LISTENING IN SILENT WONDER TO HER INCOMPREHENSIBLE DISCOURSE
BUT I MUST NEEDS FOLLOW IT UP WITH SOMETHING WORSE
SHE'D BROUGHT MOST OF THE PROPERTY AND IT WAS HER WISH THAT THIS LADY SHOULD HAVE IT HUMPH
FOURTHLY HIS LOOKS VOICE AND MANNER ARE PARTICULARLY DISPLEASING TO ME
BUT THE BOARDS CREAKED AND SHE WAS WATCHFUL
AND I'LL LOVE YOU BETTER THAN EVER I DID BEFORE WELL WELL I WILL SAID HE HASTILY KISSING ME
HE WAS EVIDENTLY PLUNGED IN GLOOMY REFLECTIONS
AND I CANNOT SUPPOSE YOU WILL REGRET MY DEPARTURE HE PAUSED
THERE IS NO OTHER ACCOUNT TO BE GIVEN OF THIS OR ANY OTHER CASE OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SERVICEABLE TALENT AND THE HIGH GIFTS OF DELOS AND PATARA'S OWN APOLLO THE SAME WORLD OF DIFFERENCE APPEARS BETWEEN HER POEMS AND THOSE OF HER PLAYFELLOW AND COMRADE EMILY
BUT ALL I DID WAS TO INFORM HER OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS ILLNESS THE CONSEQUENCE OF A FALL FROM HIS HORSE IN HUNTING AND TO TELL HER THAT THAT UNHAPPY PERSON MISS MYERS HAD LEFT HIM SOME TIME AGO IT WAS ILL DONE
AND THAT THE FIRST THING I DID WAS TO STARE AT ARTHUR GRAHAM WHO SAT BESIDE HIS MOTHER ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND THE SECOND TO STARE AT MR LAWRENCE WHO SAT BELOW
GO BACK HELEN--GO BACK DIRECTLY
AND I ADVANCED FURTHER INTO THE HALL AND FOLLOWED HIM NEARLY TO THE DOOR OF THE APARTMENT WHERE HIS MASTER WAS--FOR IT SEEMED HE WAS NOT IN BED
HE MAY BE ALL THIS BUT I DON'T KNOW HIM
I CAN CRUSH THAT BOLD SPIRIT THOUGHT I
AND OF THOSE FEW IT IS TEN TO ONE I MAY NEVER BE ACQUAINTED WITH ONE
AND IF YOUR CONSCIENCE UPBRAID YOU FOR IT SAY I OVERCAME YOU AND YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT YIELD I NEVER SAW A MAN GO TERRIBLY EXCITED
I'VE LEFT YOU A FEW SOVEREIGNS IN YOUR PURSE WHICH I EXPECT TO LAST YOU THROUGH THE MONTH
PERHAPS HE WILL STAY AMONG HIS FRIENDS TILL CHRISTMAS
WHERE'S MILICENT SHE'S THERE JUST COMING IN WITH HER SISTER HE STEPPED OUT AT THE GLASS DOOR AND WENT TO MEET THEM
AND IF I COULD BUT OBTAIN MY BROTHER'S CONSENT AND ASSISTANCE I SHOULD NOT DOUBT OF ITS SUCCESS
AND THAT MADE US THOUGHTFUL
HE WON'T HEAR OF WAITING BEYOND NEXT MONTH
BY DEGREES I WAXED MORE WARM AND TENDER THAN PERHAPS I HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
BUT HE WAS A BETTER PLAYER THAN I
FOR I FEAR SHE WILL BE SORRY TO LOSE ME
BUT I DID HOPE TO BENEFIT YOU
IN SEVEN YEARS MORE I SHALL BE AS TALL AS YOU NEARLY ARTHUR SAID HIS MOTHER TELL HIM TO COME IN
BUT MOST OF ALL AT NIGHT WHEN I ENTER MY LONELY CHAMBER AND LOOK OUT UPON THE SUMMER MOON SWEET REGENT OF THE SKY FLOATING ABOVE ME IN THE BLACK BLUE VAULT OF HEAVEN SHEDDING A FLOOD OF SILVER RADIANCE OVER PARK AND WOOD AND WATER SO PURE SO PEACEFUL SO DIVINE--AND THINK WHERE IS HE NOW?--WHAT IS HE DOING AT THIS MOMENT
BUT I DO APPROVE AND HONOUR AND RESPECT HOW SO MY DEAR
YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE LET ME ALONE AND GET TO BED YOURSELF CAN IT BE THAT MRS GRAHAM THAT DISTRESSES YOU SO NO NO I TELL YOU--IT'S NOTHING I WISH TO GOODNESS IT MAYN'T MURMURED SHE WITH A SIGH AS SHE RETURNED TO HER OWN APARTMENT WHILE I THREW MYSELF ON THE BED FEELING MOST UNDUTIFULLY DISAFFECTED TOWARDS HER FOR HAVING DEPRIVED ME OF WHAT SEEMED THE ONLY SHADOW OF A CONSOLATION THAT REMAINED AND CHAINED ME TO THAT WRETCHED COUCH OF THORNS
HELEN IMMEDIATELY PUSHED THE BOOK FROM HER AND AFTER SILENTLY SURVEYING HER SON HIS FRIEND AND HIS DOG FOR A FEW MOMENTS SHE DISMISSED THE FORMER FROM THE ROOM UNDER PRETENCE OF WISHING HIM TO FETCH HIS LAST NEW BOOK TO SHOW ME
BUT RECOLLECTING--JUST IN TIME TO SAVE MY DIGNITY--THE FOLLY OF SUCH A PROCEEDING AND HOW IT WOULD ONLY GIVE MY FAIR TORMENTORS A MERRY LAUGH AT MY EXPENSE FOR THE SAKE OF ONE I ACKNOWLEDGED IN MY OWN HEART TO BE UNWORTHY OF THE SLIGHTEST SACRIFICE--THOUGH THE GHOST OF MY FORMER REVERENCE AND LOVE SO HUNG ABOUT ME STILL THAT I COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR HER NAME ASPERSED BY OTHERS--I MERELY WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND HAVING SPENT A FEW SECONDS IN VENGIBLY BITING MY LIPS AND STERNLY REPRESSING THE PASSIONATE HEAVINGS OF MY CHEST I OBSERVED TO MISS WILSON THAT I COULD SEE NOTHING OF HER BROTHER AND ADDED THAT AS MY TIME WAS PRECIOUS IT WOULD PERHAPS BE BETTER TO CALL AGAIN TO-MORROW AT SOME TIME WHEN I SHOULD BE SURE TO FIND HIM AT HOME
BUT I HAVE MADE VERY LITTLE PROGRESS YET
WHAT THE DEUCE IS THE MATTER NOW I'M CRYING FOR YOU ARTHUR I REPLIED SPEEDILY DRYING MY TEARS
I AM CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
THEY BOTH PARTOOK OF THE CAKE BUT OBSTINATELY REFUSED THE WINE IN SPITE OF THEIR HOSTESS'S HOSPITABLE ATTEMPTS TO FORCE IT UPON THEM
THE LAST HE ANSWERED SOMEWHAT AGAINST MY EXPECTATION
MY VOICE MADE HIM SHUDDER
AND IT WAS NOT IN HIS NATURE TO SET THE WORLD AT DEFIANCE
IN PATIENT ENDURANCE OF EVIL SHE FORGETS IT IS OUR DUTY TO ADMONISH OUR NEIGHBOURS OF THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS
AT LAST I BEGAN TO THINK I MUST INTRODUCE THE SUBJECT MYSELF AND WAS PONDERING HOW TO BRING IT ABOUT WHEN JOHN UNWITTINGLY CAME TO MY RELIEF WITH THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE FROM THE COACHMAN
HE HAS BEEN QUIETER SINCE
AND IN DUE TIME THEY WERE UNITED TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF THE LITTLE WORLD THEY LIVED IN THAT HAD LONG SINCE DECLARED THEM BOTH BORN TO SINGLE BLESSEDNESS
INSTANTLY RALLYING SHE CONTINUED WITH WELL-FEIGNED CONCERN WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU
I SHALL NEVER BE IN LOVE AGAIN THAT'S CERTAIN
IT'S JUST THIS MY LAD HE CONTINUED RATHER LOWERING HIS VOICE BUT NOT ENOUGH TO PREVENT ME FROM HEARING EVERY WORD HE SAID THOUGH THE HALF-CLOSED DOOR STOOD BETWEEN US
AN INORDINATE LOVE OF CHILDREN AMONG THE REST ALL THIS WAS GRAVELY AND QUIETLY SPOKEN BUT THERE WAS A LAUGHING DEMON IN HIS HALF-AVERTED EYE THAT BODED NO GOOD I IMAGINED
MUCH OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS AND ALL OF WILDFELL HALL SHOW BRANWELL'S MARK AND THERE ARE MANY PASSAGES IN CHARLOTTE'S BOOKS ALSO WHERE THOSE WHO KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE PARSONAGE CAN HEAR THE VOICE OF THOSE SHARP MORAL REPULSIONS THOSE DISMAL MORAL QUESTIONINGS TO WHICH BRANWELL'S MISCONDUCT AND RUIN GAVE RISE
HE WANTED TO GET ME HOME HE SAID TO HAVE ME ALL TO HIMSELF AND TO SEE ME SAFELY INSTALLED AS THE MISTRESS OF GRASSDALE MANOR JUST AS SINGLE-MINDED AS NAIVE AND PIQUANTE AS I WAS
MY HEART BLED FOR HIM AS I LAY LISTENING TO THAT CEASELESS TREAD
BUT IF YOU PLOD ALONG FOR HALF AN HOUR OVER THIS SOFT EASY CARPET--GIVING WAY AT EVERY STEP YIELDING THE MORE THE HARDER YOU PRESS,--YOU'LL FIND IT RATHER WEARISOME WORK AND BE GLAD ENOUGH TO COME TO A BIT OF GOOD FIRM ROCK THAT WON'T BUDGE AN INCH WHETHER YOU STAND WALK OR STAMP UPON IT
AND DIED AT LAST AS I HAVE HEARD IN PENURY NEGLECT AND UTTER WRETCHEDNESS
IT WAS SOMETHING TO FEEL THAT HE CONSIDERED ME A WORTHY OBJECT OF PRIDE
ALREADY HE WAS BEGINNING TO STIR AND LOOK ABOUT HIM--AND THERE IT WAS FOR HIM QUIETLY BROWSING ON THE ROAD-SIDE
I THOUGHT I'D JUST SEE HOW LONG IT WOULD PLEASE YOU TO LEAVE ME ALONE I HAVE NOT BEEN VERY LONG HAVE I ARTHUR
THOUGH HE HAD TAKEN MY HAND ONCE MORE AND HALF EMBRACED ME WITH HIS OTHER ARM I WAS SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF IT AT THE TIME
DO NOTHING RASHLY
MRS MARKHAM THINKS IT WILL DO YOU GOOD AS YOU WERE TIRED WITH YOUR WALK
BUT NO WORD IN REFERENCE TO ME
HE GREETED ME WITH A SMILE INTENDED TO BE SOFT AND MELANCHOLY BUT HIS TRIUMPHANT SATISFACTION AT HAVING CAUGHT ME AT LAST SO SHONE THROUGH THAT IT WAS QUITE A FAILURE
AND THEN I SHALL APOLOGISE YOU KNOW AND ALL THAT AND TIP HER A WINK TO TAKE THE WAY OF THE SHRUBBERY
WITH A SUDDEN STROKE OF MY HAND I DASHED THE CANDLE TO THE FLOOR
THAT PASSES EVERYTHING
MR MARKHAM SAID SHE HER RAPID UTTERANCE AND HEIGHTENED COLOUR TOO PLAINLY EVINCING HER DISQUIETUDE HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE FINE SEA-VIEW WE WERE SPEAKING OF SOME TIME AGO
A WIFE HE ANSWERED
HE ASKED ME TO DANCE
POOR BLINDED FOOL THAT I WAS TO BE SO HAPPY
I'M ALMOST READY TO FAINT I FLEW TO GET THE REQUIRED REMEDY
BUT MARY MILLWARD OBSTINATELY REFUSED TO JOIN US
PARDON ME MRS HUNTINGDON HE CONTINUED BUT I CANNOT SUPPRESS MY INDIGNATION WHEN I BEHOLD SUCH INFATUATED BLINDNESS AND PERVERSION OF TASTE;--BUT PERHAPS YOU ARE NOT AWARE HE PAUSED
THEY ARE NOW GONE ON A VISIT TO HATTERSLEY'S FATHER
IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT WHEN WE ENTERED M AND DREW UP AT THE ROSE AND CROWN I ALIGHTED AND CALLED ALOUD FOR A POST-CHAISE TO GRASSDALE
HUNTINGDON AND HATTERSLEY APPEARED WITHOUT
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A POWERFUL BLOW
WOULD YOU TAKE IT AWAY AND LEAVE ME HERE ALONE WOULD YOU GIVE ME YOUR HAND TOO IF I ASKED IT HAVE I NOT SAID ENOUGH SHE ANSWERED WITH A MOST ENCHANTING SMILE
THERE THEN
I'LL TAKE A LITTLE OF YOUR HOME-BREWED ALE
AND THEN HIS MIND BEGAN TO WANDER AND WE FEARED HIS DEATH WAS APPROACHING
IN FINE WEATHER HE GENERALLY MANAGES TO GET THROUGH THE TIME PRETTY WELL BUT ON RAINY DAYS OF WHICH WE HAVE HAD A GOOD MANY OF LATE IT IS QUITE PAINFUL TO WITNESS HIS ENNUI
I WANT TO GET A CANDLE THE CANDLE WILL KEEP RETURNED HE
AS FOR MYSELF I NEED NOT TELL YOU HOW HAPPILY MY HELEN AND I HAVE LIVED TOGETHER AND HOW BLESSED WE STILL ARE IN EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY AND IN THE PROMISING YOUNG SCIONS THAT ARE GROWING UP ABOUT US
AND IT WAS TRUE ENOUGH
DID I SAY I LOVED ANNABELLA YOU SAID YOU ADORED HER TRUE BUT ADORATION ISN'T LOVE
SHE WILL BE SADLY DISAPPOINTED IF YOU REFUSE I DID NOT RELISH BEING THUS COMPASSIONATED FOR MY LONELINESS
FOR WHAT FELLOWSHIP HATH LIGHT WITH DARKNESS
FOR I POSSESS THE FACULTY OF ENJOYING THE COMPANY OF THOSE I--OF MY FRIENDS AS WELL IN SILENCE AS IN CONVERSATION I DON'T QUITE BELIEVE YOU
AND THE WEEPING ASH AND WILLOW DROOPING THEIR SNOW-CLAD BOUGHS ABOVE IT--ALL PRESENTED A PICTURE STRIKING INDEED AND PLEASING TO AN UNENCUMBERED MIND BUT BY NO MEANS ENCOURAGING TO ME
I WAS GLAD FOR I KNEW NOT HOW TO MEET HER OR WHAT TO SAY
AND WHAT REMORSE FOR ME TO THINK MY FOOLISH SCRUPLES HAD INDUCED IT ALL
AT FIRST IN COMPLIANCE WITH HIS SWEET LADY'S INJUNCTIONS I SUPPOSE HE ABSTAINED WONDERFULLY WELL FROM SEEKING TO SOLACE HIS CARES IN WINE
HE'S GOING ON VERY PROPERLY AT PRESENT WELL MA'AM IF YOU THINK SO IT'S RIGHT AND SHE WENT ON DRESSING MY HAIR IN A HURRIED WAY QUITE UNLIKE HER USUAL CALM COLLECTED MANNER MURMURING HALF TO HERSELF SHE WAS SURE IT WAS BEAUTIFUL HAIR
DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO BE MADE THE TALK OF THE COUNTRY FOR YOUR FASTIDIOUS CAPRICES THEN I MUST STAY HERE TO BE HATED AND DESPISED
BUT HE HAD WRONGED US STILL--I HOPED I TRUSTED THAT HE HAD
IS IT YOU ALICE COME AGAIN HE MURMURED
IN THAT CASE YOU MUST BE TOO ILL TO SEE THE CHILD SAID I
BUT AT THE TIME I HAD FELT IRRITATED--ALMOST INSULTED BY HIS CONDUCT
I DID BUT EXCHANGE A FEW WORDS WITH THEM JUST OUTSIDE THE PORTICO INHALING THE FRESH BRACING AIR AS I STOOD AND THEN RESISTING THE EARNEST AND ELOQUENT ENTREATIES OF ALL THREE TO STAY A LITTLE LONGER AND JOIN THEM IN A WALK ROUND THE GARDEN I TORE MYSELF AWAY AND RETURNED TO MY PATIENT
AND IT'S WELL TOO I WASN'T OVER FULL TO-NIGHT NOW I THINK OF IT OR I MIGHT HAVE SNOOZED AWAY AND NEVER DREAMT OF LOOKING WHAT MY SWEET LADY WAS ABOUT
THE BURST OF KINDNESS WAS FOR HIS PARAMOUR THE START OF HORROR FOR HIS WIFE
MY BROTHER'S COMPLIMENTS MRS HUNTINGDON AND HE HOPES YOU AND HE WILL COME TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING BY-AND-BY
FOR I THOUGHT THAT WOULD TORMENT HER AS MUCH AS ANYTHING
THEN APPROVE
BUT IF YOU CANNOT BE CONTENT TO REGARD ME AS A FRIEND--A PLAIN COLD MOTHERLY OR SISTERLY FRIEND--I MUST BEG YOU TO LEAVE ME NOW AND LET ME ALONE HEREAFTER
WE CHATTED TOGETHER A LONG TIME BUT I FOUND HER RATHER FRIVOLOUS AND EVEN A LITTLE INSIPID COMPARED WITH THE MORE MATURE AND EARNEST MRS GRAHAM
AND IF I BY MY THOUGHTLESSNESS AND SELFISH DISREGARD TO APPEARANCES HAVE AT ALL ASSISTED TO EXPOSE YOU TO THESE EVILS LET ME ENTREAT YOU NOT ONLY TO PARDON ME BUT TO ENABLE ME TO MAKE REPARATION
YOU KNOW HOW DEEPLY I HAVE YOUR ADVANTAGE AT HEART HOW I LOVE YOU AND PRIZE YOU ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD AND HOW MUCH I LONG TO SEE YOU WELL SETTLED IN LIFE--AND HOW BITTERLY IT WOULD GRIEVE ME TO SEE YOU MARRIED TO THAT GIRL--OR ANY OTHER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
HE'S AFRAID OF YOU TO BE SURE
THEN SILENTLY TURNED OVER THE LEAVES KNITTING HER BROWS THE WHILE IN SERIOUS COGITATION
SO I HAD FURNISHED MYSELF WITH A BLUE MOROCCO COLLAR FOR ARTHUR'S LITTLE DOG
SHE DID NOT SPEAK BUT FLEW TO HER DESK AND SNATCHING THENCE WHAT SEEMED A THICK ALBUM OR MANUSCRIPT VOLUME HASTILY TORE AWAY A FEW LEAVES FROM THE END AND THRUST THE REST INTO MY HAND SAYING YOU NEEDN'T READ IT ALL
SO I SUPPOSE WE'VE SEEN THE LAST OF OUR MERRY CAROUSALS IN THIS HOUSE SAID MR HATTERSLEY
WHEN YOU BEHAVE WELL SHE CAN ONLY REJOICE WITH TREMBLING
HOWEVER I RESOLVED TO MAKE MY VISIT A SHORT ONE AND TO TALK TO ELIZA IN A BROTHERLY FRIENDLY SORT OF WAY SUCH AS OUR LONG ACQUAINTANCE MIGHT WARRANT ME IN ASSUMING AND WHICH I THOUGHT COULD NEITHER GIVE OFFENCE NOR SERVE TO ENCOURAGE FALSE HOPES
MY MOTHER FOLLOWED ME TO THE VERY DOOR OF MY ROOM WITH HER QUESTIONINGS AND ADVICE CONCERNING MY HEALTH AND MY CONDUCT
PERHAPS HE REGRETTED THE PART HE HAD HAD IN PREVENTING OUR UNION BY OMITTING TO HELP US IF NOT BY ACTUALLY PLOTTING AGAINST US
I MADE AN EFFORT TO RISE BUT HE WAS KNEELING ON MY DRESS
TO ABUSE YOUR FRIEND AND KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD WITHOUT ANY ASSIGNABLE CAUSE AND THEN TELL HIM THE DEED WAS NOT QUITE CORRECT BUT IT'S NO MATTER WHETHER HE PARDONS IT OR NOT I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT IT WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF A MISTAKE,'--MUTTERED I
HITHERTO I HAD THOUGHT TOO MUCH OF MYSELF TOO LITTLE OF HIM
SO I LEFT HIM
AND HERE IT IS IF YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS TO TAKE IT A MOMENTARY BLUSH SUFFUSED HER FACE--PERHAPS A BLUSH OF SYMPATHETIC SHAME FOR SUCH AN AWKWARD STYLE OF PRESENTATION
DON'T YOU MR MARKHAM I BELIEVE IT IS NATURAL FOR OUR UNAMIABLE SEX TO DISLIKE THE CREATURES REPLIED I
THAT STORY WAS NO DOUBT THE ELABORATION OF BRANWELL'S DISEASED FANCY DURING THE THREE YEARS WHICH ELAPSED BETWEEN HIS DISMISSAL FROM THORPE GREEN AND HIS DEATH
THE ONLY ONE IN THE TOWN WAS UNDER REPAIR
AND THEY DID LOOK BEAUTIFUL WHERE AT INTERVALS THE LEVEL RAYS OF THE SUN PENETRATING THE THICKNESS OF TREES AND SHRUBS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE PATH BEFORE US RELIEVED THEIR DUSKY VERDURE BY DISPLAYING PATCHES OF SEMI-TRANSPARENT LEAVES OF RESPLENDENT GOLDEN GREEN
HE DEEMED MY FEARS FOR ARTHUR DISPROPORTIONED TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND OPPOSED SO MANY OBJECTIONS TO MY PLAN AND DEVISED SO MANY MILDER METHODS FOR AMELIORATING MY CONDITION THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO ENTER INTO FURTHER DETAILS TO CONVINCE HIM THAT MY HUSBAND WAS UTTERLY INCORRIGIBLE AND THAT NOTHING COULD PERSUADE HIM TO GIVE UP HIS SON WHATEVER BECAME OF ME HE BEING AS FULLY DETERMINED THE CHILD SHOULD NOT LEAVE HIM AS I WAS NOT TO LEAVE THE CHILD
I AM NOT SURE HOWEVER THAT MR HUNTINGDON WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME IF HE HAD BEEN AT LIBERTY TO MAKE HIS OWN SELECTION
THE COLD RAIN OF WINTER HAS SUFFICED TO NOURISH IT AND ITS FAINT SUN TO WARM IT
YOU DON'T GIVE US MUCH OF YOUR COMPANY MRS HUNTINGDON OBSERVED HE AFTER A BRIEF PAUSE DURING WHICH I WENT ON COOLLY MIXING AND TEMPERING MY COLOURS
IN SHIRE WAS THE BRIEF REPLY
YOUR BROTHER HAS NO SUCH IDEA WHISPERED MY MOTHER EARNESTLY HOLDING UP HER FINGER
BUT ARTHUR NEVER WILL LET ME BE SATISFIED WITH HIM
ONE CALM CLEAR AFTERNOON HOWEVER IN MARCH AS I WAS SUPERINTENDING THE ROLLING OF THE MEADOW-LAND AND THE REPAIRING OF A HEDGE IN THE VALLEY I SAW MRS GRAHAM DOWN BY THE BROOK WITH A SKETCH-BOOK IN HER HAND ABSORBED IN THE EXERCISE OF HER FAVOURITE ART WHILE ARTHUR WAS PUTTING ON THE TIME WITH CONSTRUCTING DAMS AND BREAKWATERS IN THE SHALLOW STONY STREAM
BUT AT LENGTH HE TOLD ME PLAINLY AND SOMEWHAT TESTILY THAT HE COULD NOT DO WITH ME
BITS OF GREY ROCK HERE AND THERE PEEPED OUT FROM THE GRASSY HILLOCKS
PERHAPS A VERY RUDE ONE--DON'T ANSWER IT IF YOU THINK SO--BUT I HATE MYSTERIES AND CONCEALMENTS I AM NOT CHANGED HELEN--UNFORTUNATELY I AM AS KEEN AND PASSIONATE AS EVER--IT IS NOT I IT IS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE CHANGED WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES
AND I PERSUADED ELIZA TO TAKE THE LATTER'S PLACE
I SHALL SAY NOTHING AGAINST YOU AS LONG AS YOU KEEP YOUR GOOD RESOLUTION OF REMAINING ALOOF FROM HER
BUT LOOK HERE
AND HOW CAN I HELP TEASING HER WHEN SHE'S SO INVITINGLY MEEK AND MIM WHEN SHE LIES DOWN LIKE A SPANIEL AT MY FEET AND NEVER SO MUCH AS SQUEAKS TO TELL ME THAT'S ENOUGH IF YOU ARE A TYRANT BY NATURE THE TEMPTATION IS STRONG I ALLOW
ONCE I HEARD HIM PAUSE AND THROW SOMETHING OUT OF THE WINDOW WITH A PASSIONATE EJACULATION
BUT IMMEDIATELY I FELT HIS STRONG ARM ROUND MY WAIST AND HIS WARM KISS ON MY CHEEK WHILE HIS KEEN AND GLEEFUL SALUTATION MY OWN HELEN WAS RINGING IN MY EAR
THEN LET ME DO IT SAID I AND LOSE NOT A MOMENT IN VAIN REPININGS AND IDLE CHAFINGS AGAINST MY FATE AND THOSE WHO INFLUENCE IT AND CONQUERING MY AGITATION WITH A POWERFUL EFFORT I IMMEDIATELY RESUMED MY TASK AND LABOURED HARD ALL DAY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS COME OVER ME OF LATE
THERE SEEMED A MOMENT OF INWARD CONFLICT AND WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT SHE WITHDREW HER HAND AND RETREATED A STEP OR TWO BACK
LORD LOWBOROUGH IN DESPERATE EARNEST AND PALE WITH ANGER SILENTLY STRUGGLING TO RELEASE HIMSELF FROM THE POWERFUL MADMAN THAT WAS STRIVING TO DRAG HIM FROM THE ROOM
FOR SHRINKING AWAY THE ONE HE TOOK THE OTHER FROM MY HAND AND SCORNFULLY CAST IT ASIDE
IT IS THIS EVER-RECURRING QUESTION AND THE HORRIBLE SUGGESTIONS IT RAISES THAT DISTRACT ME
FROM THE TIME OF OUR PARTY WHICH WAS UPWARDS OF A WEEK AGO I HAD BEEN MAKING DAILY EFFORTS TO MEET ITS MISTRESS IN HER WALKS
AND FOR YOUR HUSBAND'S SAKE ANNABELLA AND EVEN FOR YOUR OWN I WISH--I EARNESTLY ADVISE AND ENTREAT YOU TO BREAK OFF THIS UNLAWFUL CONNECTION AT ONCE AND RETURN TO YOUR DUTY WHILE YOU MAY BEFORE THE DREADFUL CONSEQUENCES YES YES OF COURSE SAID SHE INTERRUPTING ME WITH A GESTURE OF IMPATIENCE
THEN DRAWING HIMSELF UP AND REMOVING HIS HAND FROM MY CHAIR HE ANSWERED WITH PROUD SADNESS,--'THAT WAS NOT MY INTENTION I JUST GLANCED TOWARDS THE DOOR WITH A SLIGHT MOVEMENT OF THE HEAD AND THEN RETURNED TO MY BOOK
I BELIEVE NOT I ANSWERED
I DON'T MEAN TO SAY SHE DOES NOT LOVE YOU--SHE DOES I KNOW A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN YOU DESERVE
BUT I DID NOT PUT MY REQUEST IN WORDS
I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE DEAR MAMMA DIED WHEN I WAS A VERY LITTLE GIRL AND MY AUNT AT HER REQUEST OFFERED TO TAKE CHARGE OF ME AND TOOK ME AWAY TO STANINGLEY WHERE I HAVE REMAINED EVER SINCE
BUT I SHALL NOT EXPECT HIM TILL AFTER THE LAPSE OF MANY WEEKS
PRAY TELL ME WHAT I HAVE DONE OR SAID AMISS IT IS NOTHING YOU HAVE DONE OR SAID
BY SOME MEANS THEY HAVE FERRETED ME OUT AND I HAVE HAD TO SUSTAIN VISITS FROM THREE DIFFERENT FAMILIES ALL MORE OR LESS BENT UPON DISCOVERING WHO AND WHAT I AM WHENCE I CAME AND WHY I HAVE CHOSEN SUCH A HOME AS THIS
I HEARD HIGH WORDS EXCHANGED BETWEEN HIM AND HIS ALREADY HALF-INEBRIATED HOST AS I DEPARTED LEADING AWAY MY BEWILDERED AND DISCONCERTED BOY
A GENTLEMAN STOOD BY WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING OUR CONFERENCE FOR SOME TIME EVIDENTLY MUCH AMUSED AT MY COMPANION'S REMORSELESS PERTINACITY AND MY MANIFEST ANNOYANCE AND LAUGHING TO HIMSELF AT THE ASPERITY AND UNCOMPROMISING SPIRIT OF MY REPLIES
IT IS NOT MONEY MY AUNT THINKS ABOUT
IS IT BETTER TO REVEAL THE SNARES AND PITFALLS OF LIFE TO THE YOUNG AND THOUGHTLESS TRAVELLER OR TO COVER THEM WITH BRANCHES AND FLOWERS
BUT HIS MOTHER WOULD ALWAYS FOLLOW AND TRUDGE BESIDE HIM--NOT SO MUCH I BELIEVE TO ENSURE HIS SAFE CONDUCT AS TO SEE THAT I INSTILLED NO OBJECTIONABLE NOTIONS INTO HIS INFANT MIND FOR SHE WAS EVER ON THE WATCH AND NEVER WOULD ALLOW HIM TO BE TAKEN OUT OF HER SIGHT
AND PERHAPS RESENT THE INJURY BY CRUSHING THEM IN TILL YOU HAVE DESTROYED THEIR POWER THOUGH SOMEWHAT TO THE DETRIMENT OF YOUR OWN FINGERS
THE ONLY OBJECTION I HAVE TO MR HARGRAVE'S BEING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IS THAT THE FEAR OF MEETING HIM AT THE GROVE PREVENTS ME FROM SEEING HIS SISTER SO OFTEN AS I OTHERWISE SHOULD
I EXPECTED WALTER WOULD BE INTRODUCED TO YOU NEXT SEASON
DO YOU SAY SO
AT THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF DAWN I ROSE AND BROUGHT THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE WINDOW BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO READ IT YET
BUT DON'T YOU THINK MR MILLWARD SUGGESTED HE WHEN AT LENGTH THAT GENTLEMAN PAUSED IN HIS DISCOURSE THAT WHEN A CHILD MAY BE NATURALLY PRONE TO INTEMPERANCE--BY THE FAULT OF ITS PARENTS OR ANCESTORS FOR INSTANCE--SOME PRECAUTIONS ARE ADVISABLE NOW IT WAS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT MR LAWRENCE'S FATHER HAD SHORTENED HIS DAYS BY INTEMPERANCE SOME PRECAUTIONS IT MAY BE
WILL YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO EXCHANGE PLACES WITH ME MISS MARKHAM SAID SHE
SHE HAD SWEPT THE HEARTH AND MADE A BRIGHT BLAZING FIRE FOR OUR RECEPTION
BUT NEXT MORNING I VENTURED TO ENTER HIS CHAMBER AGAIN AND TAKING THE NURSE'S PLACE BY HIS BEDSIDE I WATCHED HIM AND WAITED ON HIM FOR SEVERAL HOURS SHOWING MYSELF AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AND ONLY SPEAKING WHEN NECESSARY AND THEN NOT ABOVE MY BREATH
THEY DELIGHTED HIM FAR MORE THAN MY MERRY JESTS OR HATTERSLEY'S RIOTOUS MIRTH
CERTAINLY NOT IF OTHERS ARE AS LITTLE CHANGED AS I HER FACE GLOWED IN SYMPATHY WITH MINE
AND WHEN HIS LOOKS MET MINE IT WAS WITH A SMILE--PRESUMPTUOUS IT MIGHT BE--BUT OH
TO-MORROW MRS HUNTINGDON SAID SHE YOU WILL BE DELIVERED FROM MY PRESENCE WHICH NO DOUBT YOU WILL BE VERY GLAD OF--IT IS NATURAL YOU SHOULD
MY FIRST PRETEXT FOR INVADING THE SANCTUM WAS TO BRING ARTHUR A LITTLE WADDLING PUPPY OF WHICH SANCHO WAS THE FATHER AND WHICH DELIGHTED THE CHILD BEYOND EXPRESSION AND CONSEQUENTLY COULD NOT FAIL TO PLEASE HIS MAMMA
SOME PARENTS HAVE ENTIRELY PROHIBITED THEIR CHILDREN FROM TASTING INTOXICATING LIQUORS
BUT ARE YOU HAPPY HE ASKED IN A SERIOUS TONE
FOR I HAD FULLY DETERMINED NEVER TO ENCOUNTER HIS MOTHER AGAIN
I LAUGHINGLY ASSURED HIM THAT THE CASE WAS NOT SO URGENT AS HE APPEARED TO THINK IT BUT I WAS QUITE WILLING TO GO HOME IF HE WAS
I STRUCK WALTER HARGRAVE WHEN I WAS DRUNK THE SECOND NIGHT AFTER WE CAME AND HE'S TURNED A COLD SHOULDER ON ME EVER SINCE
BUT I WAS NOT LEFT LONG ALONE FOR MR WILMOT OF ALL MEN THE LEAST WELCOME TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY ISOLATED POSITION TO COME AND PLANT HIMSELF BESIDE ME
SHE CANNOT APPRECIATE THE GOOD THAT IS IN HIM
THIS WAS MR LAWRENCE THE YOUNG SQUIRE WHOSE FAMILY HAD FORMERLY OCCUPIED WILDFELL HALL BUT HAD DESERTED IT SOME FIFTEEN YEARS AGO FOR A MORE MODERN AND COMMODIOUS MANSION IN THE NEIGHBOURING PARISH
IS TOO LITTLE PROBABLE CONSIDERING HOW HE IS SITUATED AND BY WHOM SURROUNDED AND IF HE SHOULD ASK ME TO MARRY HIM--I AM DETERMINED NOT TO CONSENT UNTIL I KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHETHER MY AUNT'S OPINION OF HIM OR MINE IS NEAREST THE TRUTH
ARE YOU PENITENT I REPLIED STEPPING UP TO HIM AND SMILING IN HIS FACE
HA HA
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT IS BUT A LAME STORY AFTER ALL AND SCARCELY ONE-HALF OF IT TRUE WHILE I SPOKE I COMPLETED THE SEALING AND DIRECTION OF MY LETTERS WITH A SOMEWHAT UNSTEADY HAND IN SPITE OF ALL MY EFFORTS TO RETAIN COMPOSURE AND IN SPITE OF MY FIRM CONVICTION THAT THE STORY WAS A LAME ONE--THAT THE SUPPOSED MRS GRAHAM MOST CERTAINLY HAD NOT VOLUNTARILY GONE BACK TO HER HUSBAND OR DREAMT OF A RECONCILIATION
THE FIRST TO ESTHER HARGRAVE IN WHICH I TOLD HER THAT I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY ANY LONGER AT GRASSDALE OR TO LEAVE MY SON UNDER HIS FATHER'S PROTECTION
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS WITH NO SMALL DEGREE OF IMPATIENCE THAT I LOOKED FORWARD TO MR LAWRENCE'S RETURN FROM GRASSDALE
AND AFTER THAT HE WOULD CALL ME ALICE OR SOME OTHER NAME ALMOST EQUALLY REPUGNANT TO MY FEELINGS
AND WHEN HE DID RETURN ALL HE TOLD ME ABOUT HER WAS THAT SHE HAD BEEN GREATLY EXHAUSTED AND WORN BY HER UNREMITTING EXERTIONS IN BEHALF OF THAT MAN WHO HAD BEEN THE SCOURGE OF HER LIFE AND HAD DRAGGED HER WITH HIM NEARLY TO THE PORTALS OF THE GRAVE AND WAS STILL MUCH SHAKEN AND DEPRESSED BY HIS MELANCHOLY END AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDANT UPON IT
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY SON HE IS WELL AND YOU MAY SEE HIM SOME TIME IF YOU WILL COMPOSE YOURSELF BUT NOT NOW WHERE IS HE HE IS SAFE IS HE HERE WHEREVER HE IS YOU WILL NOT SEE HIM TILL YOU HAVE PROMISED TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY UNDER MY CARE AND PROTECTION AND TO LET ME TAKE HIM AWAY WHENEVER AND WHEREVER I PLEASE IF I SHOULD HEREAFTER JUDGE IT NECESSARY TO REMOVE HIM AGAIN
A FEW UNPRINCIPLED MOTHERS MAY BE ANXIOUS TO CATCH A YOUNG MAN OF FORTUNE WITHOUT REFERENCE TO HIS CHARACTER
BUT IF THIS IDEA IS TOO VAST FOR YOUR HUMAN FACULTIES--IF YOUR MIND LOSES ITSELF IN ITS OVERWHELMING INFINITUDE FIX IT ON HIM WHO CONDESCENDED TO TAKE OUR NATURE UPON HIM WHO WAS RAISED TO HEAVEN EVEN IN HIS GLORIFIED HUMAN BODY IN WHOM THE FULNESS OF THE GODHEAD SHINES BUT HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SIGHED
AND IF ANNABELLA WERE TO SEE HIM AS OFTEN AS I DO SHE WOULD SPEEDILY BE DISENCHANTED
AND HE REWARDS HER BY SUCH SMILES AND GLANCES SUCH WHISPERED WORDS OR BOLDLY-SPOKEN INSINUATIONS INDICATIVE OF HIS SENSE OF HER GOODNESS AND MY NEGLECT AS MAKE THE BLOOD RUSH INTO MY FACE IN SPITE OF MYSELF--FOR I WOULD BE UTTERLY REGARDLESS OF IT ALL--DEAF AND BLIND TO EVERYTHING THAT PASSES BETWEEN THEM SINCE THE MORE I SHOW MYSELF SENSIBLE OF THEIR WICKEDNESS THE MORE SHE TRIUMPHS IN HER VICTORY AND THE MORE HE FLATTERS HIMSELF THAT I LOVE HIM DEVOTEDLY STILL IN SPITE OF MY PRETENDED INDIFFERENCE
WHAT FIEND PERSUADED HER TO IT NOTHING PERSUADED HER BUT HER OWN SENSE OF DUTY HUMBUG I WAS HALF INCLINED TO SAY SO MYSELF MARKHAM AT FIRST
COULD I BE SO WITH SUCH A HUSBAND I HAVE NOTICED A CHANGE IN YOUR APPEARANCE SINCE THE FIRST YEARS OF YOUR MARRIAGE PURSUED HE
WHILE ITS MASTER LAY AS STILL AND SILENT AS A CORPSE
BUT I MANAGED TO PRESERVE AN UNDISTURBED THOUGH GRAVE SERENITY THROUGHOUT THE DAY
HE REPLIED THAT HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO REMAIN A WEEK OR TWO LONGER AS HE HAD BUSINESS THAT REQUIRED HIS PRESENCE
WITHOUT HER I SHOULD HAVE FOUND THE WHOLE AFFAIR AN INTOLERABLE BORE
THIS WAS A NEW STAB TO MY ALREADY TORTURED HEART
CHAPTER XVIII AUGUST 25TH.--I AM NOW QUITE SETTLED DOWN TO MY USUAL ROUTINE OF STEADY OCCUPATIONS AND QUIET AMUSEMENTS--TOLERABLY CONTENTED AND CHEERFUL BUT STILL LOOKING FORWARD TO SPRING WITH THE HOPE OF RETURNING TO TOWN NOT FOR ITS GAIETIES AND DISSIPATIONS BUT FOR THE CHANCE OF MEETING MR HUNTINGDON ONCE AGAIN
MY RESOLUTIONS WERE OVERTHROWN IN A MOMENT BY THE SIMPLE FACT OF MY BROTHER'S RUNNING UP TO ME AND PUTTING INTO MY HAND A SMALL PARCEL JUST ARRIVED FROM LONDON WHICH I HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME EXPECTING
AND WHAT A TONGUE OF HER OWN TOO WHEN SHE LIKES TO USE IT
AND NOW THAT SHE IS ACCUSTOMED TO HIS LOUD VOICE AND ABRUPT UNCOURTEOUS MANNERS SHE AFFIRMS SHE FINDS NO DIFFICULTY IN LOVING HIM AS A WIFE SHOULD DO AND BEGS I WILL BURN THAT LETTER WHEREIN SHE SPOKE SO UNADVISEDLY AGAINST HIM
I WAS SO LIGHT OF HEART SO OVERFLOWING WITH AFFECTION THAT I SPRANG UPON HIM AND CLASPED HIM IN MY ARMS
BUT I DON'T CARE FOR IT BECAUSE WITH HIM I KNOW THERE IS NOTHING BUT PERSONAL VANITY AND A MISCHIEVOUS DESIRE TO EXCITE MY JEALOUSY AND PERHAPS TO TORMENT HIS FRIEND
WITHOUT RAISING MUCH SORROW OR INCURRING MUCH RESENTMENT,--OR MAKING MYSELF THE TALK OF THE PARISH
LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT AND DON'T MENTION IT TO THE SERVANTS
THANK HEAVEN SHE ADDED I HAVE NO GREAT CRIME TO CONFESS
SURELY NOT DEAREST WAS HIS REPLY
HE SHRANK AWAY AS IF THERE HAD BEEN CONTAMINATION IN MY TOUCH
FOR NEITHER HE NOR I ARE PERFECT AND I DESIRE HIS IMPROVEMENT AS EARNESTLY AS MY OWN
I SHOULD NOT MIND IF HIS LORDSHIP WERE TO SEE FIT TO INTOXICATE HIMSELF EVERY DAY
BUT I COULDN'T STAND THEIR NIGGARDLY WAYS--SHE GOT EVER LONGER AND WORSE DID MISSIS WITH HER NIPPING AND SCREWING AND WATCHING AND GRUDGING
AND I WILL LEAVE YOU TO DRAW YOUR OWN INFERENCES FROM IT
ARTHUR HAD TOLD ME AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS INTRIGUE WITH LADY F WHICH I WOULD NOT BELIEVE BEFORE
HE HIMSELF WAS NO LONGER LAUGHING NOW BUT SICK AND STUPID
I RETURNED TO MY READING AND HE ENDEAVOURED TO OCCUPY HIMSELF IN THE SAME MANNER
SHE VOUCHSAFED ME AN ALMOST FRIENDLY SMILE OF RECOGNITION--A FAVOUR THAT DEMANDED AT LEAST A CIVIL SALUTATION ON MY PART WHICH WAS ACCORDINGLY GIVEN AND RESPECTFULLY RETURNED--SHE HAD SEEN THE ERROR OF HER FORMER ESTIMATION OF MY CHARACTER
BUT NEVER FOR A MOMENT COULD SHE NUMBER ME AMONGST HER ADMIRERS
PAPA IS WRONG TO SAY SUCH THINGS AND YOU WILL BE VERY WRONG TO IMITATE HIM NOW THAT YOU KNOW BETTER WHAT IS IMITATE TO DO AS HE DOES DOES HE KNOW BETTER PERHAPS HE DOES
I CAN HELP TO GET THE ARTICLES TOGETHER BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE ART OF STOWING THEM INTO THE BOXES SO AS TO TAKE UP THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SPACE
WHILE THESE THOUGHTS FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND MY COMPANION ABRUPTLY ROSE AND CALLING HER SON SAID THEY WOULD NOW GO IN QUEST OF THE COMPANY AND DEPARTED UP THE AVENUE
I MYSELF AM SO THOROUGHLY ASHAMED OF MY COMPANIONS AND SO WEARY OF THEIR IRRATIONAL CONVERSATION AND PURSUITS--NOW THAT THERE IS NO ONE TO HUMANIZE THEM AND KEEP THEM IN CHECK SINCE YOU HAVE JUSTLY ABANDONED US TO OUR OWN DEVICES--THAT I THINK I SHALL PRESENTLY WITHDRAW FROM AMONGST THEM PROBABLY WITHIN THIS WEEK
YOU WILL THINK ME A LIAR IF I TELL YOU
O BEAUTIFUL AND FULL OF GRACE
BUT TO RETURN TO MR HARGRAVE
ONE GENTLEMAN THERE WAS FROM WHOM SHE HAD LATELY RECEIVED SOME RATHER POINTED ATTENTIONS AND UPON WHOSE HEART NAME AND FORTUNE IT WAS WHISPERED SHE HAD SERIOUS DESIGNS
YOU THINK SHE IS SINGULARLY CHARMING ELEGANT SENSIBLE AND REFINED
BUT I HAD NOT STRENGTH TO CONFRONT HIM NOW
THOUGH ALL AROUND THIS MANSION HIGH INVITES THE FOOT TO ROAM AND THOUGH ITS HALLS ARE FAIR WITHIN OH GIVE ME BACK MY HOME
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN WAY TO MY FURY AND SAID MORE BUT ARTHUR'S LOW LAUGH RECALLED ME TO MYSELF
PERHAPS MY FORMER ANSWER HAD IMPLIED TOO MUCH
SHE RECEIVED ME VERY KINDLY HAVING BEEN DOUBTLESS ALREADY PREPARED TO THINK HIGHLY OF MY CHARACTER BY HER NIECE'S TOO FAVOURABLE REPORT
AND THEN HE WINKED AT ME
OR TO-DAY SUGGESTED ROSE
BUT IT WAS NOT OF HIM I INTENDED TO SPEAK
IN THE SECOND PLACE THE SOLID VIANDS OF TO-DAY ARE MORE TO MY TASTE THAN THE DAINTIES THAT ARE PROMISED ME
OR IF I SHOULD IT IS TWENTY TO ONE HE MAY NOT HAPPEN TO BE SINGLE OR TO TAKE A FANCY TO ME THAT IS NO ARGUMENT AT ALL
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
MRS HUNTINGDON WOULD RATHER RECEIVE IT FROM YOU REPLIED HE IN A VERY SERIOUS TONE BUT LOWERING HIS VOICE THAT HIS MOTHER MIGHT NOT HEAR
BUT ESTHER MADE NO REMARK UPON IT THIS TIME
JULY 30TH.--HE RETURNED ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO RATHER BETTER IN HEALTH CERTAINLY THAN BEFORE BUT STILL WORSE IN TEMPER
IT WAS FOR THE SAKE OF ANOTHER OF MR WILMOT'S GUESTS TO WIT MR HUNTINGDON
AND I DID NOT INTERRUPT HIM AGAIN OR EVEN ATTEMPT TO REPULSE HIM
AND FINALLY HER DECEASED HUSBAND WITH HIS USUAL SELFISHNESS MIGHT HAVE SO CONSTRUCTED HIS WILL AS TO PLACE RESTRICTIONS UPON HER MARRYING AGAIN
BUT ADD TO THIS THE IDEA OF TO WHAT GOAL I WAS HASTENING AND WHOM I EXPECTED TO MEET AND YOU MAY HAVE SOME FAINT CONCEPTION OF MY FRAME OF MIND AT THE TIME--ONLY A FAINT ONE THOUGH
THE SAME MATERIAL MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED BY EMILY OR CHARLOTTE
PARDON ME BUT I MUST HAVE YOUR FORGIVENESS
IT WAS NO GENEROUS IMPULSE--NO KIND RELENTINGS THAT LED ME TO THIS--NOR EVEN THE FEAR OF WHAT MIGHT BE THE CONSEQUENCES TO MYSELF IF I FINISHED MY ASSAULT UPON THE SQUIRE BY LEAVING HIM THUS NEGLECTED AND EXPOSED TO FURTHER INJURY
EITHER I SHOULD HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEED WHICH WOULD SET ME DOWN AS A MADMAN UNLESS I ACKNOWLEDGED THE MOTIVE TOO--AND THAT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE--OR I MUST GET UP A LIE WHICH SEEMED EQUALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION--ESPECIALLY AS MR LAWRENCE WOULD PROBABLY REVEAL THE WHOLE TRUTH AND THEREBY BRING ME TO TENFOLD DISGRACE--UNLESS I WERE VILLAIN ENOUGH PRESUMING ON THE ABSENCE OF WITNESSES TO PERSIST IN MY OWN VERSION OF THE CASE AND MAKE HIM OUT A STILL GREATER SCOUNDREL THAN HE WAS
BUT STILL SINCE I KNOW IT I FEEL IT MY DUTY TO DISCLOSE IT TO YOU OH SPARE US BOTH THE INFLICTION AND I WILL EXONERATE YOU FROM THE DUTY
BUT YOU MIGHT SIT WATCHING AT THESE WINDOWS ALL DAY LONG AND NEVER SEE SO MUCH AS AN OLD WOMAN CARRYING HER EGGS TO MARKET I AM NOT SURE THE LONELINESS OF THE PLACE WAS NOT ONE OF ITS CHIEF RECOMMENDATIONS
I WOULD GIVE MY LIFE TO SAVE YOU IF I MIGHT WOULD YOU INDEED
THRUST ITSELF MOST UNPLEASANTLY UPON MY MIND AND THE APPALLING POSSIBILITY PICTURED ITSELF WITH PAINFUL VIVIDNESS TO MY IMAGINATION AS I APPROACHED THE SPOT WHERE I HAD LEFT HIM
AND WHEN I'M BURIED YOU'LL RETURN TO YOUR OLD WAYS AND BE AS HAPPY AS EVER AND ALL THE WORLD WILL GO ON JUST AS BUSY AND MERRY AS IF I HAD NEVER BEEN
CURSE YOU FOR AN IMPERTINENT HUSSY THEN CRIED HE THROWING HER FROM HIM WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT SHE FELL ON HER SIDE
MR WILMOT WILL EXCUSE YOU A MOMENT I'M SURE I ROSE WITH ALACRITY
I CRAVE YOUR PARDON DEAREST--BUT DON'T CALL ME MR HUNTINGDON
NO OFFENCE SIR I HOPE?'--(TO ME AHEM
JUST AS I THOUGHT SAID I TO MYSELF
BUT DOESN'T IT MAKE YOUR EYES SMART
THE LADIES ARE DIRECTING INQUIRING GLANCES TOWARDS US AT THIS MOMENT I SEE
IN FACT I COULD NOT REALISE THEIR TERRORS NOW
FERGUS WAS IMPERTINENT AND ABSURD
THESE THINGS ARE ALL BLESSINGS AND MERCIES IF WE ONLY KNEW HOW TO MAKE USE OF THEM BUT MRS GRAHAM DOESN'T THINK SO
I DON'T WANT YOU I ROSE AND WITHDREW TO THE NEXT ROOM WONDERING IF WE WERE TO HAVE ANOTHER SUCH MISERABLE DAY AS YESTERDAY AND WISHING INTENSELY FOR AN END OF THESE MUTUALLY INFLICTED TORMENTS
BUT HOWEVER LITTLE YOU MAY VALUE THE OPINIONS OF THOSE ABOUT YOU--HOWEVER LITTLE YOU MAY ESTEEM THEM AS INDIVIDUALS IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO BE LOOKED UPON AS A LIAR AND A HYPOCRITE TO BE THOUGHT TO PRACTISE WHAT YOU ABHOR AND TO ENCOURAGE THE VICES YOU WOULD DISCOUNTENANCE TO FIND YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS FRUSTRATED AND YOUR HANDS CRIPPLED BY YOUR SUPPOSED UNWORTHINESS AND TO BRING DISGRACE ON THE PRINCIPLES YOU PROFESS TRUE
BUT ANY COMMUNICATIONS ADDRESSED TO ME UNDER COVER TO MY BROTHER WOULD BE CERTAIN TO REACH ME
EMILY AS WE KNOW DID MAKE USE OF IT IN WUTHERING HEIGHTS
MY FATHER AS YOU KNOW WAS A SORT OF GENTLEMAN FARMER IN SHIRE
HE ATTEMPTED NEITHER DENIAL NOR EXCUSE BUT ONLY ANSWERED WITH A LONG LOW CHUCKLING LAUGH AS IF HE VIEWED THE WHOLE TRANSACTION AS A CLEVER MERRY JEST FROM BEGINNING TO END
WHAT DO YOU MEAN RACHEL I EXCLAIMED
IF YOU WANT ANOTHER REBUFF TAKE IT--AND WELCOME WAS MY INWARD REMARK
MAY I NOT BE YOURS ALSO INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE MUST PRECEDE REAL FRIENDSHIP
THIS IS NO TRIFLING MATTER
IT IS LIKE HANDLING BRIER-ROSES AND MAY-BLOSSOMS BRIGHT ENOUGH TO THE EYE AND OUTWARDLY SOFT TO THE TOUCH BUT YOU KNOW THERE ARE THORNS BENEATH AND EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU FEEL THEM TOO
THAT IT SEEMS WAS THE LAST EXPIRING FLASH OF MY LIFE'S HAPPINESS
HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS STANDING ON THE FRONT WITHOUT
0 INTRODUCTION TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS P
AN ASSUMPTION OF DIGNIFIED COLD INDIFFERENCE WOULD HARDLY DO AFTER WHAT HE KNEW OF MY DEVOTION--TO HIS FACE AT LEAST
AND I HAVE ONE BRIGHT SPOT AT LEAST WHEREON TO REST MY THOUGHTS
APRIL 16TH.--HE IS COME AND GONE
TO-MORROW MORNING DOUBTLESS THE MARRIAGE WOULD TAKE PLACE
IT IS THE WOMAN HERSELF THAT I DISLIKE BECAUSE I SO THOROUGHLY DISAPPROVE OF HER
HE ALWAYS LISTENS ATTENTIVELY NOW WHEN I SPEAK SERIOUSLY TO HIM AND I OFTEN VENTURE TO REPROVE HIS RANDOM WAY OF TALKING AND SOMETIMES HE SAYS THAT IF HE HAD ME ALWAYS BY HIS SIDE HE SHOULD NEVER DO OR SAY A WICKED THING AND THAT A LITTLE DAILY TALK WITH ME WOULD MAKE HIM QUITE A SAINT
FOR THE TIME WHEN WE SHALL BE ALWAYS TOGETHER AND CAN EXCHANGE OUR THOUGHTS WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF THESE COLD GO-BETWEENS PEN INK AND PAPER
I WOULD THEREFORE WAIT PATIENTLY TILL THESE WEARY SIX MONTHS WERE OVER AND THEN WHEN THE FUGITIVE HAD FOUND ANOTHER HOME AND I WAS PERMITTED TO WRITE TO HER I WOULD BEG TO BE ALLOWED TO CLEAR HER NAME FROM THESE VILE CALUMNIES
A FEW RAPID STRIDES AND A LITTLE ACTIVE CLAMBERING SOON BROUGHT ME TO THE PLACE WHERE SHE WAS SEATED--A NARROW LEDGE OF ROCK AT THE VERY VERGE OF THE CLIFF WHICH DESCENDED WITH A STEEP PRECIPITOUS SLANT QUITE DOWN TO THE ROCKY SHORE
THERE WAS ONE COMFORT HOWEVER,--ALL THIS WAS ENTAILED UPON LITTLE ARTHUR AND COULD NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES STRICTLY SPEAKING BE HIS MOTHER'S
NOR WOULD I WATCH AND GUARD HER TILL DEPRIVED OF SELF-RESPECT AND SELF-RELIANCE SHE LOST THE POWER OR THE WILL TO WATCH AND GUARD HERSELF;--AND AS FOR MY SON--IF I THOUGHT HE WOULD GROW UP TO BE WHAT YOU CALL A MAN OF THE WORLD--ONE THAT HAS SEEN LIFE AND GLORIES IN HIS EXPERIENCE EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD SO FAR PROFIT BY IT AS TO SOBER DOWN AT LENGTH INTO A USEFUL AND RESPECTED MEMBER OF SOCIETY--I WOULD RATHER THAT HE DIED TO-MORROW!--RATHER A THOUSAND TIMES SHE EARNESTLY REPEATED PRESSING HER DARLING TO HER SIDE AND KISSING HIS FOREHEAD WITH INTENSE AFFECTION
A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS WE HAD ANOTHER OF OUR QUIET LITTLE PARTIES TO WHICH THE USUAL COMPANY OF FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS HAD BEEN INVITED AND MRS GRAHAM AMONG THE NUMBER
BUT NOW THAT MY PRESENCE IS TOLERATED AND EVEN REQUIRED IN THE SICK-ROOM I SHALL HAVE BUT LITTLE TIME TO SPARE BETWEEN MY HUSBAND AND MY SON,--FOR I MUST NOT ENTIRELY NEGLECT THE LATTER
NO LIGHT GLIMMERED IN THE WINDOWS NO WREATH OF SMOKE OBSCURED THE STARS THAT SPARKLED ABOVE IT IN THE FROSTY SKY
ANNABELLA DOUBTLESS SAW IT TOO
IN A LITTLE WHILE HOWEVER I WAS SENSIBLE THAT SOME ONE WAS APPROACHING ME WITH A LIGHT BUT SLOW AND HESITATING TREAD
YET THIS WAS NOT THE WORST
I WAS CALM AND COOL THROUGHOUT
I ADMIRED YOU THEN MOST DEEPLY BUT I DARED NOT LOVE YOU
I'M GOING SAID I
I DEFY YOU TO MAKE ME SUPPOSE IT I COULD SEE THE RED FIRELIGHT DIMLY GLEAMING FROM HER PARLOUR WINDOW
23RD.--THANK HEAVEN HE IS COME AT LAST
IT SEEMED FULL OF EXTRAVAGANT PROTESTATIONS OF AFFECTION
OF LATE HOWEVER I HAVE SEEN NOTHING IN HER CONDUCT TOWARDS ARTHUR TO ANGER OR ALARM ME
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO RESPECT AND HONOUR THE MAN I MARRY AS WELL AS LOVE HIM FOR I CANNOT LOVE HIM WITHOUT
AND THIS TOO WHEN WE HAD PARTED SIXTEEN MONTHS AGO AND SHE HAD EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN ME TO HOPE FOR A RE-UNION IN THIS WORLD AND NEVER SENT ME A LINE OR A MESSAGE FROM THAT DAY TO THIS
I MUST BE INFATUATED OR I SHOULD SCORN TO REGRET HIM AS I DO
HE SOMEWHAT TO MY DISCOMFORT ENTICED HER FROM THE ROOM TO HAVE A RUN IN THE HALL AND THENCE INTO THE GARDEN
SHE CERTAINLY IS A MAGNIFICENT CREATURE THOUGHT I AS I BEHELD THAT TALL FINELY DEVELOPED FIGURE AND THE REFLECTION OF THE HANDSOME FACE IN THE MIRROR BEFORE ME WITH THE GLOSSY DARK HAIR SLIGHTLY AND NOT UNGRACEFULLY DISORDERED BY THE BREEZY RIDE THE RICH BROWN COMPLEXION GLOWING WITH EXERCISE AND THE BLACK EYES SPARKLING WITH UNWONTED BRILLIANCE
I THINK HE WISHES TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO ME ALONE
IT WAS BUT LITTLE SLEEP I GOT THAT NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING I ROSE PERPLEXED AND TROUBLED WITH THE THOUGHTS OF MEETING HIM AT BREAKFAST
SHE FELT ITS EXHILARATING INFLUENCE AND SO DID I--I FELT IT TINGLING THROUGH MY FRAME BUT DARED NOT GIVE WAY TO IT WHILE SHE REMAINED SO QUIET
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE DID NOT GREATLY DISCONCERT ME HOWEVER BECAUSE I ATTRIBUTED IT NOT SO MUCH TO ANY DISLIKE OF MY PERSON AS TO SOME ABSOLUTE RESOLUTION AGAINST A SECOND MARRIAGE FORMED PRIOR TO THE TIME OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE WHETHER FROM EXCESS OF AFFECTION FOR HER LATE HUSBAND OR BECAUSE SHE HAD HAD ENOUGH OF HIM AND THE MATRIMONIAL STATE TOGETHER
AND MISS ELIZA RISING TO GREET HER THEY BOTH SEATED THEMSELVES NEAR THE FIRE WHERE THAT IDLE LAD FERGUS WAS STANDING LEANING HIS SHOULDER AGAINST THE CORNER OF THE CHIMNEY-PIECE WITH HIS LEGS CROSSED AND HIS HANDS IN HIS BREECHES-POCKETS
BUT WOULD NOT ALL SUCH SORROW BE MISPLACED
AND WHATEVER I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE MY DUTY NOW IS PLAINLY TO LOVE HIM AND TO CLEAVE TO HIM AND THIS JUST TALLIES WITH MY INCLINATION
MR HUNTINGDON THEN WENT UP-STAIRS
I REJOICED IN MY ADVANTAGE BUT DARED NOT GLORY IN IT YET
HATTERSLEY LAUGHED
AND THEN SHE MIGHT EXPOSE HERSELF TO FRESH SCANDAL I WISH I HAD TOLD HER SAID I
FOR MY MOTHER WITH ALL HER KINDNESS WAS VASTLY PARTICULAR ON CERTAIN POINTS
I HAD EYES FOR NONE BUT HER
BUT EVERY KINDLY IMPULSE WAS CHECKED BY THE LOOK OF COLD DISTRUST SHE CAST UPON ME ON OPENING THE DOOR
I KNOW IT IS SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO HEAR AND SOMETHING YOU WOULD DISPLEASE ME BY TELLING YOU HAVE DIVINED TOO TRULY I FEAR
JUDGING FROM APPEARANCES HIS IDEA OF A WIFE IS A THING TO LOVE ONE DEVOTEDLY AND TO STAY AT HOME TO WAIT UPON HER HUSBAND AND AMUSE HIM AND MINISTER TO HIS COMFORT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY WHILE HE CHOOSES TO STAY WITH HER
SO FROM THAT TIME I HAVE CAREFULLY REFRAINED FROM ANY NOTICE OF THE SUBJECT WHATEVER AND LEFT LORD LOWBOROUGH TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF
IT WAS EVIDENT HE INTENDED TO BE MY COMPANION ALL THE WAY
SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE SOFA AND PUTTING BACK HER BRIGHT GOLDEN RINGLETS THAT WERE SCATTERED IN WILD PROFUSION OVER HER FACE SHE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT THE GARDEN AND HER LITTLE PLAYFELLOW AND CONTINUED TO CHATTER AWAY IN HER USUAL STRAIN TILL HER BROTHER SUMMONED HER TO DEPART
AS SOON AS THE CARRIAGE DOOR WAS OPENED SHE SPRANG OUT AND WENT DOWN THE PARK TO MEET THE GENTLEMEN WHO WERE JUST RETURNING FROM THE WOODS
JULY 22_ND 1848
I AM IN PARADISE NOW
I KNEW THEIR GOD WAS MINE AND HE WAS STRONG TO SAVE AND SWIFT TO HEAR
BUT I AM GLAD NOW OF THIS OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING YOU ONCE MORE AND KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN ME AND OF ASSURING YOU THAT I SHALL NEVER CEASE TO REMEMBER YOU THERE WAS A MOMENT'S PAUSE
WHAT REWARD DID YOU LOOK FOR HE ASKED
IT IS ENOUGH TO POISON ONE EATING SUCH A DISGUSTING MESS AND HE PETTISHLY PUSHED AWAY HIS PLATE AND LEANT BACK DESPAIRINGLY IN HIS CHAIR
BUT WHEN AFTER A FEW MINUTES SECLUSION IN THE LIBRARY I HAD REGAINED MY COMPOSURE AND WAS RETURNING TO JOIN MRS HARGRAVE AND MILICENT WHOM I HAD JUST HEARD COME DOWNSTAIRS AND GO INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM I FOUND HIM THERE STILL LINGERING IN THE DIMLY-LIGHTED APARTMENT AND EVIDENTLY WAITING FOR ME
AND IF YOU INTEND TO REFUSE HIM GIVE ME YOUR REASONS I SHALL REFUSE HIM OF COURSE
I HATE HIM--I HATE HIM
HE DEPARTED
I HAVE ARGUED THESE QUESTIONS WITH MYSELF AND PONDERED WELL OUR PAST AND PRESENT AND FUTURE CAREER
EVEN AT HIS AGE HE OUGHT NOT TO BE ALWAYS TIED TO HIS MOTHER'S APRON-STRING
AND I AM GLAD OF IT YOU FLATTER ME HELEN REPLIED HE STROKING THE CHILD'S SOFT WAVY LOCKS
IT'S SILENT FRETTING AND CONSTANT ANXIETY ON YOUR ACCOUNT MINGLED I SUSPECT WITH SOMETHING OF BODILY FEAR ON HER OWN
I THINK SIR THERE'S A BIT OF BOTH SHE REPLIED
YOU CANNOT INJURE YOUR HUSBAND YOU KNOW AND NO ONE ELSE HAS ANY CONCERN IN THE MATTER I HAVE A SON MR HARGRAVE AND YOU HAVE A MOTHER SAID I RETIRING FROM THE WINDOW WHITHER HE HAD FOLLOWED ME
SHE IS NOT DETERMINED TO FORGET ME
THAT IN FUTURE YOU WILL NEVER MAKE A JEST OF THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS AND ALWAYS USE YOUR INFLUENCE WITH YOUR FRIENDS FOR THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE AGAINST THEIR EVIL PROPENSITIES INSTEAD OF SECONDING THEIR EVIL PROPENSITIES AGAINST THEMSELVES I WILL DO MY UTMOST SAID HE TO REMEMBER AND PERFORM THE INJUNCTIONS OF MY ANGEL MONITRESS AND AFTER KISSING BOTH MY GLOVED HANDS HE LET ME GO
I WAS NOT HARMING THE CHILD MADAM SAID I SCARCE KNOWING WHETHER TO BE MOST ASTONISHED OR DISPLEASED
BUT SHE STOOD STILL AND FIXED HER EYES UPON IT WITH A GAZE THAT ASSURED ME SHE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED
I AM NOT SO BESET WITH VISITORS BUT THAT I CAN READILY SPARE A FEW MINUTES TO THE FEW THAT DO FAVOUR ME WITH THEIR COMPANY YOU HAVE ALMOST COMPLETED YOUR PAINTING SAID I APPROACHING TO OBSERVE IT MORE CLOSELY AND SURVEYING IT WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF ADMIRATION AND DELIGHT THAN I CARED TO EXPRESS
I WISH I COULD SAY HALF AS MUCH FOR YOU OH I FORGOT YOU ARE A SAINT TOO
OH THAT THE MORNING WERE COME AND WE WERE ON OUR WAY AT LEAST
SO WE LET HIM BE
IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HIM ALWAYS WITH RACHEL AND I DARE NOT LEAVE HIM FOR A MOMENT WITH ANY OF THE OTHER SERVANTS OR SUFFER HIM TO BE ALONE LEST HE SHOULD MEET THEM
BUT SHE SEEMED TO THINK ENOUGH HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT AND ABRUPTLY TURNED THE CONVERSATION
I AM YOUR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR YOUR SON'S GODFATHER AND YOUR HUSBAND'S FRIEND
MRS HUNTINGDON SHE EXCLAIMED TURNING TO ME AND STILL HOLDING ME FAST BY THE HAND I'M QUITE SHOCKED AT YOU--YOU'RE JUST AS ANGRY AND DISTANT AND COLD AS HE IS
BUT I ANSWERED WITH A SMILE AND IMPUDENTLY ENOUGH WELL I AM COME TO HEAR YOUR EXPLANATION I TOLD YOU I WOULD NOT GIVE IT SAID SHE
BUT WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE SECURED YOUR REWARD AND FIND YOURSELF SAFE IN HEAVEN AND ME HOWLING IN HELL-FIRE CATCH YOU LIFTING A FINGER TO SERVE ME THEN
PERHAPS YOU CAN FORGIVE MY WANT OF CANDOUR AND REMEMBER AS SOME PARTIAL MITIGATION OF THE OFFENCE HOW LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT TO FRIENDLY CONFIDENCE YOU HAVE GIVEN ME OF LATE YES YES--I REMEMBER IT ALL
BUT I DID NOT THINK OF THAT
YOU SEE I WAS NOT MADE TO BE A SAINT SAID HE LAUGHING IF GOD MEANT ME TO BE RELIGIOUS WHY DIDN'T HE GIVE ME A PROPER ORGAN OF VENERATION YOU ARE LIKE THE SERVANT I REPLIED WHO INSTEAD OF EMPLOYING HIS ONE TALENT IN HIS MASTER'S SERVICE RESTORED IT TO HIM UNIMPROVED ALLEGING AS AN EXCUSE THAT HE KNEW HIM TO BE A HARD MAN REAPING WHERE HE HAD NOT SOWN AND GATHERING WHERE HE HAD NOT STRAWED OF HIM TO WHOM LESS IS GIVEN LESS WILL BE REQUIRED BUT OUR UTMOST EXERTIONS ARE REQUIRED OF US ALL
MANY MEN OF MR HUNTINGDON'S HABITS HAD LIVED TO A RIPE THOUGH MISERABLE OLD AGE
THOUGH I FOUND NO PLEASURE IN IT IT WOULD BE LESS IRKSOME THAN IDLENESS--AT ALL EVENTS IT WOULD BE MORE PROFITABLE
I DO NOT THINK MRS GRAHAM WAS PARTICULARLY DELIGHTED TO SEE US
CHAPTER L ON READING THIS I HAD NO REASON TO DISGUISE MY JOY AND HOPE FROM FREDERICK LAWRENCE FOR I HAD NONE TO BE ASHAMED OF
I FOLDED UP THE LETTER ROSE AND RETURNED IT TO HIM WITH NO REMARK BUT THANK YOU I WILL TAKE A LESSON BY IT MY LITTLE ARTHUR WAS STANDING BETWEEN HIS KNEES DELIGHTEDLY PLAYING WITH THE BRIGHT RUBY RING ON HIS FINGER
BUT YOU MR HATTERSLEY WHEN YOU HEAR MY NAME BELIED AND SLANDERED WILL YOU DEFEND IT I WILL I INSTANTLY DEPARTED AND SHUT MYSELF INTO THE LIBRARY
AND DON'T PUT SO MUCH PEPPER IN THEY'LL NOT LIKE IT I'M SURE"--OR ROSE DON'T PUT SO MANY SPICES IN THE PUDDING GILBERT LIKES IT PLAIN,"--OR MIND YOU PUT PLENTY OF CURRANTS IN THE CAKE FERGUS LIKED PLENTY IF I SAY WELL MAMMA I DON'T I'M TOLD I OUGHT NOT TO THINK OF MYSELF
BUT YOU HAD BETTER LIE DOWN NOW AND BE QUIET
HE'S VERY CLOSE IS MASTER SAID THE FELLOW WITH A FOOLISH SIMPERING GRIN
OF COURSE I DID NOT FOLLOW
AND SMILING WITH THE COOLEST ASSURANCE SHE BEGAN YOUR HUSBAND WAS MERRY LAST NIGHT HELEN
BUT MY REASON PARDON ME--AND DO YOU REMEMBER ASSURING ME THAT THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR UNEASINESS ON YOUR ACCOUNT
I KNEW THAT SUCH CHARACTERS'--AS HUNTINGDON AND HIS COMPANIONS--'DO EXIST AND IF I HAVE WARNED ONE RASH YOUTH FROM FOLLOWING IN THEIR STEPS THE BOOK HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN IN VAIN IF THE STORY HAS GIVEN MORE PAIN THAN PLEASURE TO ANY HONEST READER THE WRITER CRAVES HIS PARDON FOR SUCH WAS FAR FROM MY INTENTION BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE CANNOT PROMISE TO LIMIT HER AMBITION TO THE GIVING OF INNOCENT PLEASURE OR TO THE PRODUCTION OF A PERFECT WORK OF ART TIME AND TALENT SO SPENT I SHOULD CONSIDER WASTED AND MISAPPLIED GOD HAS GIVEN HER UNPALATABLE TRUTHS TO SPEAK AND SHE MUST SPEAK THEM
BUT HE DOES NOT WANT ME BACK
WHY ARE YOU IN SUCH A HURRY TO LEAVE ME HELEN HE SAID WITH A SMILE OF THE MOST PROVOKING SELF-SUFFICIENCY
AND I CANNOT BEAR TO DISAPPOINT HER
THINK HOW WELL WELL DON'T BOTHER ME NOW--I'LL SEE ABOUT IT I REPLIED
AND I WAS SO MUCH AFFECTED BETWEEN SORROW AND JOY THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO PAUSE A FEW SECONDS BEFORE I COULD STEADY MY VOICE TO REPLY
WHERE BOTH WILL BEHOLD THE SAME GLORIOUS TRUTHS AND DRINK EXALTED AND SUPREME FELICITY FROM THE SAME FOUNTAIN OF LIGHT AND GOODNESS--THAT BEING WHOM BOTH WILL WORSHIP WITH THE SAME INTENSITY OF HOLY ARDOUR--AND WHERE PURE AND HAPPY CREATURES BOTH WILL LOVE WITH THE SAME DIVINE AFFECTION
HE WAS REPLIED HE WITH THE SAME CALM GRAVITY AS BEFORE
BECAUSE IT IS MONSTROUS AND NOT TO BE CREDITED BUT BY THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM THE EFFECTS OF IT SUCH CRUEL TORMENTS THAT THEY KNOW IT TO BE INDEED REALITY
ABSTRACT YOURSELF FROM HER AND STAND ALONE AND YOU MADAM SAID HE STERNLY ARRESTING HIMSELF AND TURNING ROUND UPON ME YOU HAVE INJURED ME TOO BY THIS UNGENEROUS CONCEALMENT THERE WAS A SUDDEN REVULSION IN MY FEELINGS
22ND.--I HAVE HAD SEVERAL LETTERS FROM ARTHUR ALREADY
WE HAD BEEN ROMPING WITH THE LITTLE CREATURES ALMOST AS MERRY AND WILD AS THEMSELVES AND NOW PAUSED IN THE SHADE OF THE TALL COPPER BEECH TO RECOVER BREATH AND RECTIFY OUR HAIR DISORDERED BY THE ROUGH PLAY AND THE FROLICSOME BREEZE WHILE THEY TODDLED TOGETHER ALONG THE BROAD SUNNY WALK
FOR IT WAS HIS FATE TO HAND IN A CAPACIOUS OLD DOWAGER AND MINE TO BE HANDED IN BY MR GRIMSBY A FRIEND OF HIS BUT A MAN I VERY GREATLY DISLIKED
AND THE BLOOD LEFT HIS CHEEK AS HE SPOKE
YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE MUCH TOWARDS IT
I HAD ENTERED HER PRESENCE INTENDING TO CONDOLE WITH HER UPON THE WICKEDNESS OF THE WORLD AND HELP HER TO ABUSE THE VICAR AND HIS VILE INFORMANTS BUT NOW I FELT POSITIVELY ASHAMED TO MENTION THE SUBJECT AND DETERMINED NOT TO REFER TO IT UNLESS SHE LED THE WAY
THE LATTER CONTINUED SHE MOST DEEPLY REGRETS THE STEP THAT HAS OCCASIONED HIS RELAPSE
I SAW HER CAST HERSELF BACK IN THE OLD OAK CHAIR AND COVER HER FACE WITH HER HANDS
BUT ALLOW ME TO SAY I THINK OTHERWISE
BUT BESIDES BEING OLD HE WAS UGLY AND DISAGREEABLE,--AND WICKED I AM SURE THOUGH MY AUNT SCOLDED ME FOR SAYING SO
AND THEN FEARING LEST SHE SHOULD TURN ME OUT OF THE HOUSE I BEGAN TALKING ABOUT INDIFFERENT MATTERS IN ORDER TO GAIN TIME
SHE IS ELEGANT AND ACCOMPLISHED ABOVE THE GENERALITY OF HER BIRTH AND STATION
SO COME ALONG HUNTINGDON YOU BLACKGUARD SHE CAN'T DENY IT CRIED THE GENTLEMAN THUS ADDRESSED GRINNING IN MINGLED RAGE AND TRIUMPH
GO ON RICHARD THERE WAS A TOUCH OF SADNESS AS WELL AS COLDNESS IN HER VOICE BUT I KNEW NOT TO WHAT TO ASCRIBE IT
THEN I MUST GO DOWN ON MY KNEES SAID HE
I'LL GO AND ASK HER SAID THE CHILD
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S ABOUT
AND MEANTIME I WOULD CONTINUE TO SEE LAWRENCE NOW AND THEN THOUGH NOT SO OFTEN AS BEFORE AND I WOULD STILL PURSUE MY HABITUAL INQUIRIES AFTER HIS SISTER IF HE HAD LATELY HEARD FROM HER AND HOW SHE WAS BUT NOTHING MORE
YOU'VE BEEN GOING TO REFORM THESE TWELVE MONTHS AND MORE YES BUT YOU WOULDN'T LET ME
ONLY I THOUGHT YOU DISLIKED HER HE QUIETLY ADDED CURLING HIS CLASSIC LIP WITH A SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC SMILE
SUCH THOUGHTS AS THESE CHASED ONE ANOTHER THROUGH MY MIND AS I PACED TO AND FRO THE ROOM AND LONGED--OH HOW I LONGED--TO TAKE MY CHILD AND LEAVE THEM NOW WITHOUT AN HOUR'S DELAY
MOST LIKELY NOT
INSTINCTIVELY THE FINGERS OF MY WHIP-HAND TINGLED AND GRASPED THEIR CHARGE WITH CONVULSIVE ENERGY
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF SAVAGE SATISFACTION THAT I BEHELD THE INSTANT DEADLY PALLOR THAT OVERSPREAD HIS FACE AND THE FEW RED DROPS THAT TRICKLED DOWN HIS FOREHEAD WHILE HE REELED A MOMENT IN HIS SADDLE AND THEN FELL BACKWARD TO THE GROUND
IT WAS BURNING INDEED
SHE COULD NOT NOW ABSENT HERSELF UNDER THE PLEA OF DARK EVENINGS OR INCLEMENT WEATHER AND GREATLY TO MY RELIEF SHE CAME
I LOOKED UP AT IT
IT WANTED BUT THIS TO FILL THE MEASURE OF HIS OFFENCES
5TH.--ALAS
BUT SHE WAS UP AGAIN BEFORE EITHER I OR HER BROTHER COULD COME TO HER ASSISTANCE AND MADE THE BEST OF HER WAY OUT OF THE ROOM AND I SUPPOSE UP-STAIRS WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME
I WENT TO SEE HIM ONCE OR TWICE--NAY TWICE OR THRICE--OR BY'R LADY SOME FOUR TIMES--AND WHEN HE GOT BETTER I TENDERLY BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE FOLD WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN I RESTORED HIM TO THE BOSOM OF THE CLUB AND COMPASSIONATING THE FEEBLENESS OF HIS HEALTH AND EXTREME LOWNESS OF HIS SPIRITS I RECOMMENDED HIM TO TAKE A LITTLE WINE FOR HIS STOMACH'S SAKE AND WHEN HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY RE-ESTABLISHED TO EMBRACE THE MEDIA-VIA NI-JAMAIS-NI-TOUJOURS PLAN--NOT TO KILL HIMSELF LIKE A FOOL AND NOT TO ABSTAIN LIKE A NINNY--IN A WORD TO ENJOY HIMSELF LIKE A RATIONAL CREATURE AND DO AS I DID
I THINK I MUST TROUBLE YOU NOW TO TELL ME THE NEAREST WAY TO IT
I SHOULD HAVE MADE A VERY HANDSOME APOLOGY BUT YOU PROVOKED ME SO CONFOUNDEDLY WITH YOUR WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S MY FAULT
AND IN THE END HE WAS SUCCESSFUL AS YOU ALREADY KNOW
AND BY THUS LIVING BEYOND HER LEGITIMATE MEANS AND LAVISHING SO MUCH ON THEIR BROTHER SHE RENDERS THEM PORTIONLESS AND MAKES THEM BURDENS ON HER HANDS
AND INSTEAD OF ATTEMPTING TO SOLICIT IT I EMPLOYED MYSELF IN RAPIDLY PACING THE CHAMBER HAVING FIRST REMOVED MY BOOTS LEST MY MOTHER SHOULD HEAR ME
I LOVED HIM FOR IT BETTER THAN I LIKED TO EXPRESS
MY MOTHER HEARD HIM WITH PROFOUNDEST REVERENCE
I CAN'T LET YOU HAVE IT INDEED LET ME HAVE ITS BOWELS THEN SAID HE
YOU CANNOT HAVE SUCH GRAVE CONFESSIONS TO MAKE--YOU MUST BE TRYING MY FAITH HELEN NO NO NO SHE EARNESTLY REPEATED--'I WISH IT WERE SO
AT ANY RATE NOBODY CAN REGRET MORE SINCERELY THAN I DO THE RESULT OF MY BRUTALITY AS YOU RIGHTLY TERM IT NEVER MIND THAT SAID HE FAINTLY SMILING
HE'LL THROW HIMSELF AWAY ON THE FIRST OLD MAID THAT CHOOSES TO SET HER CAP AT HIM,--AS IF I CARED WHAT HE DID WITH HIMSELF WELL SAID I IF YOU DO GIVE UP YOUR INTIMACY WITH THESE MEN I DON'T THINK YOU WILL HAVE MUCH CAUSE TO REGRET THE LOSS OF THEIR SOCIETY
BUT TO ME IT HAS NOT BEEN PLEASANTLY EMPLOYED INTERRUPTED I
I TOLD HIM I WAS SORRY BUT SINCE HE HAD FORFEITED MY CONFIDENCE HE MUST TAKE THE CONSEQUENCE
AND AT EVENINGS ESPECIALLY THE TIMES WHEN THE CHILD SEES HIM THE MOST AND THE OFTENEST HE IS ALWAYS PARTICULARLY JOCUND AND OPEN-HEARTED
BUT I IMPLORED HER TO LET ME ALONE TILL MORNING
I WILL NEVER LEAVE THEE NOR FORSAKE THEE SEEMED WHISPERED FROM ABOVE THEIR MYRIAD ORBS
AND DEIGNING NO FURTHER REJOINDER SHE SLIGHTLY BOWED AND WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW
NO--WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT DO?--IT WOULD MAKE HIM NO BETTER AND ME NO HAPPIER I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TALK TO YOU MRS HUNTINGDON SAID HE SMILING
IT IS SUMMER YET SHE REPLIED
HIS LOOKS HIS SPIRITS AND HIS TEMPER ARE ALL PERCEPTIBLY CHANGED FOR THE BETTER SINCE I LAST SAW HIM
AND THAT BEING GIVEN AND RECEIVED WITH MUCH MORE JOY AND GRATITUDE ON THE PART OF THE RECEIVER THAN THE WORTH OF THE GIFT OR THE SELFISH MOTIVE OF THE GIVER DESERVED I VENTURED TO ASK MRS GRAHAM FOR ONE MORE LOOK AT THE PICTURE IF IT WAS STILL THERE
I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO BE WORSE THAN MY FELLOWS
RACHEL HAS BEEN TO DRESS ME AND SAYS I HAVE HAD A SAD NIGHT OF IT SHE CAN SEE
I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU WILL TELL LORD LOWBOROUGH SUPPOSE I DO WELL IF YOU ARE DISPOSED TO PUBLISH THE MATTER I CANNOT DISSUADE YOU OF COURSE--BUT THERE WILL BE TERRIBLE WORK IF YOU DO--AND IF YOU DON'T I SHALL THINK YOU THE MOST GENEROUS OF MORTAL BEINGS--AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THE WORLD I CAN DO FOR YOU--ANYTHING SHORT OF SHE HESITATED
IT WAS LIKE TURNING FROM SOME PURGATORIAL FIEND TO AN ANGEL OF LIGHT COME TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE SEASON OF TORMENT WAS PAST
I SHOULD BE SORRY TO DISTRESS YOUR HUSBAND WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND MILICENT
AS LONG AS YOU STAY I SHALL ATTEND TO YOU AND NEGLECT MY BUSINESS BUT I WON'T LET YOU I RETURNED
AND WHAT WILL BE THE END OF IT
HAVE I HELEN YOU KNOW I DETEST THEM BOTH AND ME I HAVE NO REASON TO DETEST YOU BUT WHAT ARE YOUR SENTIMENTS TOWARDS ME
I FEARED AT FIRST HE WAS GOING TO TORTURE ME BY UNSATISFACTORY REPLIES AND EITHER LEAVE ME QUITE IN THE DARK CONCERNING WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW OR FORCE ME TO DRAG THE INFORMATION OUT OF HIM MORSEL BY MORSEL BY DIRECT INQUIRIES
LET ME HEAR FROM YOU SOON AND I WILL WRITE AGAIN TO TELL YOU HOW WE GET ON
JUST AS I WAS TAKING LEAVE OF THE VICAR SHE ENTERED THE ROOM READY EQUIPPED FOR A WALK
THESE QUALITIES HOWEVER AS YOU WAY READILY IMAGINE COMBINED TO RENDER HER AN EXCELLENT MOTHER TO THE CHILDREN AND AN INVALUABLE WIFE TO HIS LORDSHIP
I AM IN HELL ALREADY CRIED HE
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TRIED YET HELEN--WE CAN BUT HOPE SAID SHE IN HER COLD CAUTIOUS WAY
THE NAME UPON THE CARDS WAS MRS GRAHAM WHICH APPELLATION I MEAN HENCEFORTH TO ADOPT
BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER
HE WAS ASLEEP IN A MINUTE
I WAITED NEARLY HALF-AN-HOUR IN UNCOMFORTABLE SUSPENSE EXPECTING EVERY MINUTE TO BE CALLED AND VAINLY LONGING TO HEAR HIM GO
WELL I THINK I SHALL ALWAYS HAVE PLENTY TO SAY
ACCEPT MY SINCERE THANKS THEN SHE SPRANG UP AND OFFERED ME HER HAND
BUT I DID NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH ANY OF THEM
FORTH CAME THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM
IT SPOILS THE BEST OF US DOESN'T IT
IT WILL BE A HARD TASK BUT SURELY NO IMPRUDENCE
BUT DON'T BOTHER ME NOW--I'M NOT GOING TO DIE YET
BUT TAKE IT HOME WITH YOU AND HURRIED FROM THE ROOM
YOU HELEN
THUS RESOLVING WITH A KIND OF SULLEN RESIGNATION IF SUCH A TERM MAY BE ALLOWED I WENDED MY WAY TO RYECOTE FARM SCARCELY EXPECTING TO FIND ITS OWNER WITHIN AT THIS TIME OF DAY BUT HOPING TO LEARN IN WHAT PART OF THE PREMISES HE WAS MOST LIKELY TO BE FOUND
I HAVE REFUSED TO HEAR
I'VE READ IT THROUGH SAID I ADVANCING INTO THE ROOM,--'AND I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'LL FORGIVE ME--IF YOU CAN FORGIVE ME SHE DID NOT ANSWER BUT HER EYES GLISTENED AND A FAINT RED MANTLED ON HER LIP AND CHEEK
HAVE THEY ALL LEFT ME--SERVANTS AND ALL THERE ARE SERVANTS WITHIN CALL IF YOU WANT THEM
YOU'LL NOT OBJECT TO GRIMSBY I HATE HIM
AND I RECEIVED SUCH CONFIDENCES SO QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY THAT HE WAS NEVER INDUCED TO DISCONTINUE THEM
THEY ARE BLAMING YOU ARTHUR FOR YOUR TEMPERANCE AND SOBRIETY AND I'M COME TO THANK YOU FOR IT
FOR WERE HE TEN TIMES AS SENSUAL AND IMPENETRABLE TO GOOD AND LOFTY THOUGHTS I WELL KNOW I HAVE NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN
HE WANTED THE SPIRIT AND ASSURANCE TO CARRY HIS POINT
AND IT WILL BE NO USE KEEPING THE COFFEE WAITING FOR HIM OR HIS COMPANIONS
NOW HUNTINGDON EXCLAIMED HIS IRASCIBLE FRIEND I WILL NOT HAVE YOU SITTING THERE AND LAUGHING LIKE AN IDIOT OH HATTERSLEY CRIED HE WIPING HIS SWIMMING EYES--'YOU'LL BE THE DEATH OF ME YES I WILL BUT NOT AS YOU SUPPOSE
ANOTHER WORD ON THE SUBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE THE LAST ATOM THAT BREAKS THE CAMEL'S BACK
YOU SEE THEIR BRAINS--I MENTION NO NAMES BUT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND TO WHOM I ALLUDE--THEIR BRAINS ARE LIGHT TO BEGIN WITH AND THE FUMES OF THE FERMENTED LIQUOR RENDER THEM LIGHTER STILL AND PRODUCE AN ENTIRE LIGHT-HEADEDNESS OR GIDDINESS RESULTING IN INTOXICATION
ON YOU BE THE CURSE THEN SAID HE
THE GRASS BEING SODDEN WITH RAIN AFFORDED THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN A RATHER INHOSPITABLE COUCH
WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED THE TIME YET
NOT SO MUCH FOR THE SAKE OF MY SON'S AFFECTION THOUGH I DO PRIZE THAT HIGHLY AND THOUGH I FEEL IT IS MY RIGHT AND KNOW I HAVE DONE MUCH TO EARN IT AS FOR THAT INFLUENCE OVER HIM WHICH FOR HIS OWN ADVANTAGE I WOULD STRIVE TO PURCHASE AND RETAIN AND WHICH FOR VERY SPITE HIS FATHER DELIGHTS TO ROB ME OF AND FROM MOTIVES OF MERE IDLE EGOTISM IS PLEASED TO WIN TO HIMSELF
MAMMA DOES ALL SHE CAN SAID SHE TO MAKE ME FEEL MYSELF A BURDEN AND INCUMBRANCE TO THE FAMILY AND THE MOST UNGRATEFUL SELFISH AND UNDUTIFUL DAUGHTER THAT EVER WAS BORN
YOU'RE NOT FIT TO ASSOCIATE WITH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LIKE US THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO RUN SNOOKING ABOUT TO OUR NEIGHBOURS HOUSES PEEPING INTO THEIR PRIVATE CORNERS AND SCENTING OUT THEIR SECRETS AND PICKING HOLES IN THEIR COATS WHEN WE DON'T FIND THEM READY MADE TO OUR HANDS--YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SUCH REFINED SOURCES OF ENJOYMENT CAN'T YOU BOTH GO SUGGESTED ELIZA DISREGARDING THE LATTER HALF OF THE SPEECH
WOULD SHE COME IN THERE AND FIND ME OUT
I WAS NOT SENT INTO THE WORLD MERELY TO EXERCISE THE GOOD CAPACITIES AND GOOD FEELINGS OF OTHERS--WAS I?--BUT TO EXERT MY OWN TOWARDS THEM
I HAD NOT BEEN ABSENT FIVE MINUTES BUT HE REPROACHED ME BITTERLY FOR MY LEVITY AND NEGLECT
WHAT IS THE MATTER NOTHING NOTHING--GIVE ME A CANDLE BUT WON'T YOU TAKE SOME SUPPER NO
COME THEN HELEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE A GOOD GIRL SAID HE
WE NONE OF US DESERVE TO BE WORSHIPPED
I THOUGHT CONTINUED HE I'D JUST LOOK IN UPON YOU AS I PASSED AND TASTE YOUR HOME-BREWED ALE
BUT EITHER THE ACCOUNT WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED OR I WAS RATHER DULL OF COMPREHENSION FOR I COULD NOT CLEARLY UNDERSTAND HOW THAT SHOULD KEEP HIM IN TOWN A FORTNIGHT AFTER ME
BUT I SHALL ONLY ANGER YOU BY REPEATING IT I SEE SO I HAD BETTER HOLD MY TONGUE SHE CLOSED HER LIPS AND FOLDED HER HANDS BEFORE HER WITH AN AIR OF INJURED MEEKNESS
NO CERTAINLY
I WAS WANDERING IN THE PARK AND HE ON SEEING ME THERE AS HE RODE PAST MADE BOLD TO ENTER AND APPROACH ME DISMOUNTING AND LEAVING HIS HORSE AT THE GATE
BUT SURELY IT WAS NOT MY FAULT
LET US WASTE NO TIME IN USELESS EXPLANATION BUT TELL ME WILL YOU HE VEHEMENTLY SWORE HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND INSISTED UPON HEARING WHAT POISONOUS OLD WOMAN HAD BEEN BLACKENING HIS NAME AND WHAT INFAMOUS LIES I HAD BEEN FOOL ENOUGH TO BELIEVE
HE VANISHED I SUPPOSE TO HIS OWN APARTMENT FOR NOTHING MORE WAS SEEN OF HIM TILL THE MORNING
BUT STILL I SAID NOTHING TANGIBLE AND SHE ATTEMPTED NO REPULSE UNTIL IN PASSING A MOSS ROSE-TREE THAT I HAD BROUGHT HER SOME WEEKS SINCE IN MY SISTER'S NAME SHE PLUCKED A BEAUTIFUL HALF-OPEN BUD AND BADE ME GIVE IT TO ROSE
BUT I REPEAT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN
BETTER FAR THAT HE SHOULD LIVE IN POVERTY AND OBSCURITY WITH A FUGITIVE MOTHER THAN IN LUXURY AND AFFLUENCE WITH SUCH A FATHER
FOR NONE BUT A GENTLEMAN COULD PLEASE HER REFINED TASTE AND NONE BUT A RICH ONE COULD SATISFY HER SOARING AMBITION
THEN YOU MUST PLEAD FOR ME HELEN SAID HE AND AT LENGTH WITHDREW
WITH HER USUAL IMPUDENCE MY COMPANION THEN MADE SOME ATTEMPTS TO GET UP A CONVERSATION
NO MOST WILLINGLY I WOULD AH
ON LOOKING UP I BEHELD HIM STANDING ABOUT TWO YARDS OFF WITH HIS CLEAR BLUE EYES WISTFULLY GAZING ON THE DOG TRANSFIXED TO THE SPOT NOT BY FEAR OF THE ANIMAL BUT BY A TIMID DISINCLINATION TO APPROACH ITS MASTER
YOU MAD CREATURE HOW COULD YOU COME OUT IN YOUR LIGHT EVENING DRESS THIS CHILL AUTUMN NIGHT IT IS A GLORIOUS NIGHT SAID I
BUT SINCE I DID MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE THE ONLY REMEDY I COULD THINK OF WAS TO TAKE IT AWAY YOU MISUNDERSTOOD ME CRUELLY I REPLIED AND IN A MINUTE I HAD OPENED THE WINDOW AGAIN LEAPED OUT PICKED UP THE FLOWER BROUGHT IT IN AND PRESENTED IT TO HER IMPLORING HER TO GIVE IT ME AGAIN AND I WOULD KEEP IT FOR EVER FOR HER SAKE AND PRIZE IT MORE HIGHLY THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD I POSSESSED
FOR GOOD BAD OR INDIFFERENT ONE ALWAYS LIKES TO BE THE FIRST TO TELL
BUT THEN I HAD THE OTHER GUESTS TO ATTEND TO AND I DID NOT WATCH THEM NARROWLY--FOR TO CONFESS THE TRUTH I FEARED TO SEE ANYTHING BETWEEN THEM
BUT THE FACT IS MRS HUNTINGDON I HAVE A DISCLOSURE TO MAKE PAINFUL FOR ME TO OFFER AS FOR YOU TO HEAR
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN HAPPY LATELY HE SAID WITH A KIND OF EFFORT TO REGAIN COMPOSURE AND A DETERMINATION TO WAIVE THE FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HIS OWN CALAMITY
I'M SURE A FINER DISPOSITION THAN YOURS BY NATURE COULD NOT BE IF YOU'D LET IT HAVE FAIR PLAY
I FEAR HE IS FULLY DETERMINED TO ENJOY HIMSELF THIS NIGHT
I TURNED AWAY AND HASTENED HOMEWARDS DESCENDING WITH RAPID STRIDES THE STEEP ROUGH LANE AND LEAVING HIM TO FOLLOW AS HE PLEASED
TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE JOURNEY HOWEVER A COUPLE OF MY FELLOW-PASSENGERS KINDLY CAME TO MY ASSISTANCE AND BROUGHT ME LOW ENOUGH
AND YET I FEAR THERE WAS MORE COLDNESS THAN GENTLENESS IN THE QUIET TONE OF MY REPLY:--'I MIGHT OFFER MANY EXCUSES THAT SOME WOULD ADMIT TO BE VALID BUT I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO ENUMERATE THEM I KNOW THEM SAID HE HASTILY
BUT I DETERMINED HE SHOULD MAKE THE FIRST ADVANCES OR AT LEAST SHOW SOME SIGNS OF AN HUMBLE AND CONTRITE SPIRIT FIRST
AND SHE NO DOUBT IS ACTUATED BY MUCH THE SAME MOTIVES
HE AND LORD LOWBOROUGH WERE ACCOMPANYING ANNABELLA AND ME IN A LONG DELIGHTFUL RIDE
DURING MY STAY AT THORPE GREEN SHE WRITES ON JULY 31 1845 I HAVE HAD SOME VERY UNPLEASANT AND UNDREAMT-OF EXPERIENCE OF HUMAN NATURE
I SHALL FORGET EVERY WORD OF YOUR DIRECTIONS BEFORE I REQUIRE THEM
AND AS TO BEING EASILY LED TO SUSPECT GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT A BLIND INCREDULOUS FOOL I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN PERSEVERINGLY SHUTTING MY EYES AND STOPPING MY EARS AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT THREATENED TO SHAKE MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU TILL PROOF ITSELF CONFOUNDED MY INFATUATION WHAT PROOF SIR WELL I'LL TELL YOU
IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO REFORM AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE SENSE TO DESIRE IT AND THE STRENGTH TO EXECUTE YOUR PURPOSE WELL TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I'VE THOUGHT OF IT OFTEN AND OFTEN BEFORE
I TAKE THE IMPUTATION IN GOOD PART AS A COMPLIMENT TO THE JUST DELINEATION OF MY FEMALE CHARACTERS
HE HAS SEEMED TO BE ON THE WATCH ALL DAY
LET MY SISTER ALONE IF YOU PLEASE AND HE MADE AN EFFORT TO UNCLASP THE RUFFIAN'S FINGERS FROM HER ARM BUT WAS SUDDENLY DRIVEN BACKWARD AND NEARLY LAID UPON THE FLOOR BY A VIOLENT BLOW ON THE CHEST ACCOMPANIED WITH THE ADMONITION TAKE THAT FOR YOUR INSOLENCE
HIMSELF UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING OR APPRECIATING YOUR REAL EXCELLENCES
LTD
DO I LOVE YOU CRIED HE
HERE TAKE IT SAID I IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO READ IT NO REPLIED HE YOU MAY READ IT IF YOU LIKE I READ IT AND SO MAY YOU
BUT STILL WE DID NOT CEASE TO BE FRIENDS
AND THEIR ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO SUCH DISCOURSE IS TO PLUNGE OVER HEAD AND EARS INTO THE SLOUGH OF SCANDAL--WHICH IS THEIR CHIEF DELIGHT NOT ALL OF THEM SURELY CRIED THE LADY ASTONISHED AT THE BITTERNESS OF MY REMARK
OR IF THERE WAS ONE OF THE DRAUGHT HORSES WITHIN AN AVAILABLE DISTANCE HE WAS TREATED TO A STEADY RIDE UPON THAT WHICH SERVED HIS TURN ALMOST AS WELL
SUCH STORMY THOUGHTS--SO MANY DIFFERENT RESOLUTIONS CROWDED IN UPON ME THAT MY MIND WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN A CHAOS OF CONFLICTING PASSIONS
NO SAID HE
SO WE DON'T LIKE TO BE SEPARATED BUT MY DEAR I CALL THAT DOTING SAID MY PLAIN-SPOKEN PARENT
I WON'T--I WON'T SO I HANDED THEM DOWN AGAIN TO THE OWNERS
BUT IN HALF A MINUTE OR LESS MY HOSTESS IMPATIENTLY ROSE AND TAKING HER FORMER STATION ON THE RUG BETWEEN ME AND THE CHIMNEY CORNER EARNESTLY EXCLAIMED GILBERT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?--WHY ARE YOU SO CHANGED
SHE GRINDS HER DEPENDENTS PINCHES HER SERVANTS AND DEPRIVES EVEN HER DAUGHTERS AND HERSELF OF THE REAL COMFORTS OF LIFE BECAUSE SHE WILL NOT CONSENT TO YIELD THE PALM IN OUTWARD SHOW TO THOSE WHO HAVE THREE TIMES HER WEALTH
HE SOON SPIED THEM OUT AND PUTTING DOWN THE CANDLE DELIBERATELY PROCEEDED TO CAST THEM INTO THE FIRE
BUT YOU--WE CAN'T DO TOO MUCH FOR YOU
ALL THE SWEET SUMMER IS PASSING AWAY WITHOUT ONE BREATH OF PLEASURE TO ME OR BENEFIT TO HIM
IT WAS MILICENT POOR MILICENT GONE TO SEE HOW I WAS--NO ONE ELSE CARED FOR ME
ONLY THIS RETURNED I
SHE PRODUCED HER PURSE AND COOLLY COUNTED OUT THE MONEY BUT HESITATED TO PUT IT INTO MY HAND
PRAISING HIS GOODNESS TO THE SKIES BUT WITH AN EVIDENT THOUGH BUT HALF-EXPRESSED WISH THAT IT WERE BASED ON A SURER FOUNDATION THAN THE NATURAL IMPULSES OF THE HEART AND A HALF-PROPHETIC DREAD OF THE FALL OF THAT HOUSE SO FOUNDED ON THE SAND,--WHICH FALL HAD SHORTLY AFTER TAKEN PLACE AS HATTERSLEY MUST HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS WHILE HE READ
HE THEN TOOK UP ONE OF THE CANDLES AND RELIGHTED IT BY THRUSTING IT INTO THE FIRE
HE DID IT WITHOUT ANY OF THAT SAD BUT PROUD HUMILITY HE USUALLY ASSUMES IN ADDRESSING ME UNLESS HE IS EXCITED WITH WINE
SHE THINKS SHE HAS MANAGED SO WELL FOR ME
HIS OCCUPATIONS BEING THOSE OF FARMING AND BREEDING HORSES AND CATTLE DIVERSIFIED WITH A LITTLE HUNTING AND SHOOTING AND ENLIVENED BY THE OCCASIONAL COMPANIONSHIP OF HIS FRIENDS BETTER FRIENDS THAN THOSE OF HIS YOUTH AND THE SOCIETY OF HIS HAPPY LITTLE WIFE NOW CHEERFUL AND CONFIDING AS HEART COULD WISH AND HIS FINE FAMILY OF STALWART SONS AND BLOOMING DAUGHTERS
PROBABLY HE ADDED WITH A SMILE YOUR ONLY REGRET ON THE SUBJECT WILL BE THAT I DO NOT TAKE ALL MY COMPANIONS ALONG WITH ME
I HAVE NOT UPBRAIDED HIM BY WORD OR LOOK
BLAND OF DUFFIELD DERBY IN CONJUNCTION WITH MR C
LAST NIGHT HE CAME TO ME BRIMFUL OF HIS NEW-FOUND FELICITY
AND SOME OF THEM MAINTAINED THAT HE SHOULD EITHER BE COMPELLED TO DO AS OTHERS DID OR EXPELLED FROM THE SOCIETY
BUT SURELY IN THIS LONELY SPOT I MIGHT REMAIN UNKNOWN
HE HAD ONLY RECEIVED A CUT ABOVE THE TEMPLE AND PERHAPS A FEW BRUISES FROM THE FALL OR THE HOOFS OF HIS OWN PONY
AND I SUPPOSE MILICENT BY A TRAIN OF ASSOCIATIONS WAS LED TO THINK OF HER SISTER
I HAD MUCH ADO TO GET AWAY MYSELF
THEY'RE HARDLY FIT FOR A LADY'S EYES--THE MOST PART OF THEM
HEAR HEAR
ATTENTIVELY REGARDING ME IN A TONE OF SOOTHING SOFTNESS SHE OBSERVED,--'YOU THINK YOURSELF INSULTED MR MARKHAM--I WISH I COULD MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT--THAT I I DO UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY I SAID
HELEN SAID SHE YOU OFTEN SEE ESTHER DON'T YOU NOT VERY OFTEN BUT YOU HAVE MORE FREQUENT OPPORTUNITIES OF MEETING HER THAN I HAVE
MY MOTHER PRETENDING TO LISTEN WITH DEEP ATTENTION AND WATCHING HIS ANIMATED COUNTENANCE WITH A DEGREE OF MATERNAL ADMIRATION I THOUGHT HIGHLY DISPROPORTIONED TO ITS OBJECT
AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD OR GLANCE SHE WITHDREW WITH HER CHILD INTO THE GARDEN
IN FACT SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF ANY ONE'S PUTTING HIMSELF OUT OF THE WAY TO ACCOMPANY HER THOUGH FERGUS VOUCHSAFED TO OFFER HIS SERVICES IN CASE THEY SHOULD BE MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN MINE AND MY MOTHER BEGGED SHE MIGHT SEND ONE OF THE FARMING-MEN TO ESCORT HER
THIS I HAVE NOW EFFECTED
ARTHUR BEING NOW AWAKENED BY THE JOLTING AND THE STOPPAGES WE ALL GOT OUT AND WALKED
I DO NOT ASK YOU TO LEAVE YOUR HOME OR DEFY THE WORLD'S OPINION BUT I NEED NOT REPEAT ALL HIS ARGUMENTS
FOR I DARE NOT TRUST ANY OF THE SERVANTS IN SUCH A CASE MOST WILLINGLY I CONSENTED AND IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT HIM HIS DESK
COME NOW
COME NOW
BUT QUICKLY LOOKING UP HE BEGAN TO TALK OF OTHER SUBJECTS TRYING TO DRAW ME INTO A CHEERFUL AND FRIENDLY CONVERSATION BUT I WAS TOO MUCH IRRITATED TO DISCOURSE WITH HIM AND SOON TOOK LEAVE
THAT SHE MIGHT SHARE MY EXILE
ANNE'S VERSES WRITTEN FROM ONE OF THE HOUSES WHERE SHE WAS A GOVERNESS EXPRESS PRECISELY THE SAME FEELING AND MOVEMENT OF MIND
I SHOULD LIKE TO BE LESS OF A PET AND MORE OF A FRIEND IF I MIGHT CHOOSE
YOU ARE ONLY ADVISED TO PARTAKE OF THESE COARSER VIANDS IN SUCH MODERATION AS NOT TO INCAPACITATE YOU FROM ENJOYING THE CHOICER BANQUET OF TO-MORROW
IN SIX MONTHS YOU SHALL HEAR FROM FREDERICK PRECISELY WHERE I AM
BUT BEFORE THE WORDS WERE WELL OUT OF MY MOUTH I REGRETTED HAVING UTTERED THEM
FOR HE WAS VERY ASSIDUOUS IN PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO HIS OLD FRIEND WHO DID NOT HOWEVER CONSIDER HIMSELF GREATLY OBLIGED BY THE ATTENTION
AT THAT MOMENT DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED
WELL I'LL SEE HER HOWEVER WAS MY CONCLUDING RESOLVE BUT NOT TO-DAY
BUT I IMMEDIATELY ASSUMED AN ASPECT OF INDIFFERENCE AND AFFECTED TO BE GAZING CARELESSLY AROUND ME AND I SUPPOSE SHE WENT ON
AFTER WHAT YOU SAID LAST NIGHT
MARKHAM SAID HE IN HIS USUAL QUIET TONE WHY DO YOU QUARREL WITH YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN ONE QUARTER
BUT TELL ME DO YOU NEVER THINK OF REVENGE REVENGE
SHE ENTERED CALM PALE COLLECTED
SHE FLATTERED HERSELF SHE HAD HAD EXPERIENCE ENOUGH IN THOSE MATTERS TO BE JUSTIFIED IN TRUSTING TO HER OWN JUDGMENT--AND AS FOR HIS LORDSHIP'S LACK OF FORTUNE SHE CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT AS SHE HOPED HER OWN WOULD SUFFICE FOR BOTH
BUT IF I HAD TOLD YOU ANYTHING OF MY HISTORY I MUST HAVE TOLD YOU ALL IN ORDER TO EXCUSE MY CONDUCT
I HAVE LEARNED TO BE MERRY AND WISE TO BE MORE EASY WITH MYSELF AND MORE INDULGENT TO MY NEIGHBOURS AND I CAN AFFORD TO LAUGH AT BOTH LAWRENCE AND YOU
SHE GRAVELY EXAMINED THE VOLUME ON BOTH SIDES
SHE IS HANDSOME--OR RATHER I SHOULD SAY DISTINGUISHED AND INTERESTING--IN HER APPEARANCE BUT BY NO MEANS AMIABLE--A WOMAN LIABLE TO TAKE STRONG PREJUDICES I SHOULD FANCY AND STICK TO THEM THROUGH THICK AND THIN TWISTING EVERYTHING INTO CONFORMITY WITH HER OWN PRECONCEIVED OPINIONS--TOO HARD TOO SHARP TOO BITTER FOR MY TASTE HE MADE NO REPLY BUT LOOKED DOWN AND BIT HIS LIP AND SHORTLY AFTER ROSE AND SAUNTERED UP TO MISS WILSON AS MUCH REPELLED BY ME I FANCY AS ATTRACTED BY HER
DREADFUL INDEED HER TRIALS MUST HAVE BEEN
IN A MINUTE OR TWO SOME ONE ASKED ME IF I FELT UNWELL
MOVING FROM UNDER HIS HAND WITH A GESTURE OF INSULTED DIGNITY MR HARGRAVE TOOK HIMSELF AWAY TO THE OTHER END OF THE RUG
THEN PLACING HIS TWO HANDS ON HER SHOULDERS HE GAVE HER I SUPPOSE A SKETCH OF THE GREAT THINGS HE MEANT TO DO FOR SHE SUDDENLY THREW HER ARMS ROUND HIM AND BURST INTO TEARS EXCLAIMING,--'DO DO RALPH--WE SHALL BE SO HAPPY
BUT I CANNOT GO HELEN BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR OUR DEPARTURE
WE WERE OBLIGED TO LET ONE MAN INTO OUR SECRET ON ACCOUNT OF THE BOXES C
I HAVE NEVER FOR A SINGLE HOUR SINCE I MARRIED HIM KNOWN WHAT IT IS TO REALISE THAT SWEET IDEA IN QUIETNESS AND CONFIDENCE SHALL BE YOUR REST THOSE TWO DETESTABLE MEN GRIMSBY AND HATTERSLEY HAVE DESTROYED ALL MY LABOUR AGAINST HIS LOVE OF WINE
AND THEN PERHAPS I MAY TROUBLE YOU
I WOULD SEE HER ONCE MORE AND FAIRLY SATISFY MYSELF IN WHAT LIGHT TO REGARD HER BEFORE WE PARTED
HALLO LOWBOROUGH HE BEGAN--'OH
HE FOLLOWED AND WOULD HAVE ENTERED INTO SOME KIND OF CONVERSATION WITH ME BUT THE OTHER GUESTS WERE NOW BEGINNING TO ASSEMBLE AND I TOOK NO MORE NOTICE OF HIM EXCEPT TO GIVE HIM HIS COFFEE
SHE GAVE ME FULL LIBERTY TO DO SO IF I SHOULD SEE ANYTHING REPREHENSIBLE OR SUSPICIOUS IN HER CONDUCT
INDEED I DON'T
I THINK THE OTHER WOULD HAVE KNOCKED HIM DOWN HAD HE NOT INSTINCTIVELY STARTED BACK BEFORE THAT BONY FIST QUIVERING WITH RAGE AND CLENCHED TILL THE KNUCKLES GLEAMED WHITE AND GLISTENING THROUGH THE SKIN
SHOWING HER THE BOOK THAT I STILL HELD IN MY HAND AND POINTING TO THE NAME ON THE FLY-LEAF BUT FIXING MY EYE UPON HER FACE I ASKED,--'DO YOU KNOW THAT GENTLEMAN OF COURSE I DO REPLIED SHE
I AM ONLY AFRAID HIS AFFECTION LOSES IN DEPTH WHERE IT GAINS IN ARDOUR
I HAVE EXHAUSTED EVERY OTHER SUBJECT FOR PAINTING
IN YOUR MOUTH THEY ARE TEN TIMES WORSE AND IF YOU KNEW HOW MUCH THEY PAIN ME YOU WOULD CEASE AT ONCE I KNOW
AUGUST 24TH.--ARTHUR IS HIMSELF AGAIN AS LUSTY AND RECKLESS AS LIGHT OF HEART AND HEAD AS EVER AND AS RESTLESS AND HARD TO AMUSE AS A SPOILT CHILD AND ALMOST AS FULL OF MISCHIEF TOO ESPECIALLY WHEN WET WEATHER KEEPS HIM WITHIN DOORS
AND THEN SHE SIGHED AND CONTINUED
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE AND I HOPE THE LAST I WISHED I HAD NOT MARRIED HIM
AND NOW THAT FINE WEATHER WAS COME AT LAST BEING DETERMINED TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT I HAD GATHERED ALL HANDS TOGETHER INTO THE HAY-FIELD AND WAS WORKING AWAY MYSELF IN THE MIDST OF THEM IN MY SHIRT-SLEEVES WITH A LIGHT SHADY STRAW HAT ON MY HEAD CATCHING UP ARMFULS OF MOIST REEKING GRASS AND SHAKING IT OUT TO THE FOUR WINDS OF HEAVEN AT THE HEAD OF A GOODLY FILE OF SERVANTS AND HIRELINGS--INTENDING SO TO LABOUR FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT WITH AS MUCH ZEAL AND ASSIDUITY AS I COULD LOOK FOR FROM ANY OF THEM AS WELL TO PROSPER THE WORK BY MY OWN EXERTION AS TO ANIMATE THE WORKERS BY MY EXAMPLE--WHEN LO
AND RACHEL PRONOUNCED HIM A VERY NICE GENTLEMAN
YOU HAVE BEEN MARRIED AND PROBABLY--I MIGHT SAY ALMOST CERTAINLY--WILL BE AGAIN YOU ARE MISTAKEN THERE MA'AM SAID SHE ALMOST HAUGHTILY
YES,--I HAVE FORGIVEN YOU
STANINGLEY
SO THAT I TRUST SHE MAY YET BE HAPPY
BUT A CONVULSIVE MOVEMENT OF THE FINGERS AND A FAINTLY WHISPERED DON'T LEAVE ME IMMEDIATELY RECALLED ME
SO THAT A STRANGER COMING AMONGST US MAKES AN INVALUABLE ADDITION TO OUR EXHAUSTED SOURCES OF AMUSEMENT
HERE WAS ARTHUR LEFT TO ME AT LAST
WHAT COULD HE OF ALL MEN HAVE TO REVEAL THAT WAS OF IMPORTANCE FOR ME TO HEAR
BUT I HAD NOT BEEN SEATED THREE MINUTES BEFORE SHE BROUGHT THAT LADY ON TO THE CARPET HERSELF IN A RATHER REMARKABLE MANNER
AND I SHOULD THEN KNOW HOW TO COMFORT YOU SHE SHOOK HER HEAD DESPONDINGLY
SHE TURNED WHITE IN THE FACE AND DREW HER BREATH THROUGH HER TEETH IN A SAVAGE SORT OF WAY;--BUT SHE OFFERED NO EXTENUATION OR DEFENCE
AND IF BY ANY CHANCE HE SHOULD LOOK IN HERE I FELT ASSURED HE WOULD SOON DEPART ON SEEING ME FOR INSTEAD OF BECOMING LESS COOL AND DISTANT TOWARDS ME HE HAD BECOME DECIDEDLY MORE SO SINCE THE DEPARTURE OF HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS WHICH WAS JUST WHAT I WISHED
YES BOTH TO BE SURE CRIED ROSE
I WAS NATURALLY TOUCHY OR IT WOULD NOT HAVE VEXED ME SO MUCH
I WILL NEVER UTTER ANOTHER WORD ON THE SUBJECT
ASK MRS HATTERSLEY TO BE SO KIND AS TO MAKE THE TEA JOHN SAID I
I AM SATISFIED HE REPLIED WITH BITTER EMPHASIS THAT YOU ARE THE MOST COLD-HEARTED UNNATURAL UNGRATEFUL WOMAN I EVER YET BEHELD UNGRATEFUL SIR UNGRATEFUL NO MR HARGRAVE I AM NOT
NEAR WHAT TOWN IS STANINGLEY SITUATED I ASKED
BUT I TOOK HER HAND AND FERVENTLY KISSED IT
NOW SHE WAS EVIDENTLY RELIEVED
A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT HOWEVER INDUCED HIM TO COME FORWARD
HE IS NOT ALWAYS CHEERFUL NOR ALWAYS CONTENTED AND SHE OFTEN COMPLAINS OF HIS ILL-HUMOUR WHICH HOWEVER OF ALL PERSONS SHE OUGHT TO BE THE LAST TO ACCUSE HIM OF AS HE NEVER DISPLAYS IT AGAINST HER EXCEPT FOR SUCH CONDUCT AS WOULD PROVOKE A SAINT
BUT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF GETTING HIM WITHOUT HIS BETTER HALF OUR MUTUAL FRIEND ANNABELLA
I GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY START BACK ON SEEING HER AT WHICH SHE UTTERED A SHORT LAUGH OBSERVING I THINK WE ARE BOTH DISAPPOINTED I CAME FORWARD AND BUSIED MYSELF WITH THE BREAKFAST THINGS
BUT I DON'T WISH HER TO FORGET ME ALTOGETHER
ONLY THINK SHE CONTINUED TURNING TO THE CONFOUNDED ROSE WHAT A FOOL THE MAN MUST BE AND WHO GAVE YOU THIS PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE MISS ELIZA SAID I INTERRUPTING MY SISTER'S EXCLAMATIONS
AND IF THERE WERE FIFTY MORE WHO'S TO GET THEM I WONDER WITHOUT MONEY OH SOMEBODY WILL TAKE YOU FOR YOUR TITLE
THE LATTER OFFERED NO REPLY BUT AVERTED HER FACE AND BRUSHED AWAY A TEAR
I ANSWERED COMPOSEDLY ALL INQUIRIES RESPECTING MY HEALTH
AND WHEN I COMPLAINED OF THE FLAVOUR OF THE OVERDRAWN TEA SHE POURED THE REMAINDER INTO THE SLOP-BASIN AND BADE ROSE PUT SOME FRESH INTO THE POT AND REBOIL THE KETTLE WHICH OFFICES WERE PERFORMED WITH GREAT COMMOTION AND CERTAIN REMARKABLE COMMENTS
AND THEREFORE I BEG YOU WILL ASK NOTHING ABOUT IT FOR YOUR CURIOSITY WILL NOT BE GRATIFIED REPLIED SHE ATTEMPTING TO COVER THE TARTNESS OF HER REBUKE WITH A SMILE
UNLUCKILY FOR ME HE WAS MORE SOBER THAT NIGHT THAN HE USUALLY IS AT SUCH AN HOUR
I VENTURED TO TAKE THAT UP TOO
BUT WHEN THEY ARE SOUGHT--WHEN THE CITADEL OF THE HEART IS FAIRLY BESIEGED--IT IS APT TO SURRENDER SOONER THAN THE OWNER IS AWARE OF AND OFTEN AGAINST HER BETTER JUDGMENT AND IN OPPOSITION TO ALL HER PRECONCEIVED IDEAS OF WHAT SHE COULD HAVE LOVED UNLESS SHE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL AND DISCREET
IS THIS A CHRISTIAN SPIRIT?--YOU HATE HIM
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT SHE WRITES OR WHAT TO THINK
OH I BEG YOUR PARDON PLEADED SHE
BUT I KNEW A SMOKING TUMBLER OF BRANDY-AND-WATER WOULD COMFORT HIM BEST AND HAD NEARLY PREPARED IT WHEN HE PEEVISHLY PUSHED IT AWAY SAYING DO LET ME ALONE HUNTINGDON
I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THEM
AND WHILE YOU READ IT DID YOU EVER PICTURE TO YOURSELF WHAT MY FEELINGS WOULD PROBABLY BE DURING ITS PERUSAL
I MOVED A FEW PACES AND THEN LOOKED BACK FOR ONE LAST VIEW OF HER STATELY HOME THAT I MIGHT HAVE ITS OUTWARD FORM AT LEAST IMPRESSED UPON MY MIND AS INDELIBLY AS HER OWN IMAGE WHICH ALAS
BUT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT MAKING A PICNIC TO SEE IT SOME FINE DAY
SHE'S NOT THE SUSCEPTIBLE ANXIOUS WORRITING CREATURE YOU IMAGINE
BUT WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE SO MAGNIFICENT A CREATURE AND THE CREAM OF THE JEST CONTINUED MR HUNTINGDON LAUGHING IS THAT THE ARTFUL MINX LOVES NOTHING ABOUT HIM BUT HIS TITLE AND PEDIGREE AND THAT DELIGHTFUL OLD FAMILY SEAT HOW DO YOU KNOW SAID I
THE MORE PLAINLY AND NATURALLY THE THING WAS DONE THE BETTER I THOUGHT
THOUGH I ASKED HIS PARDON THE VERY MORNING AFTER IT WAS DONE YOUR MANNER OF ASKING IT RETURNED THE OTHER AND THE CLEARNESS WITH WHICH YOU REMEMBERED THE WHOLE TRANSACTION SHOWED YOU WERE NOT TOO DRUNK TO BE FULLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT AND QUITE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEED YOU WANTED TO INTERFERE BETWEEN ME AND MY WIFE GRUMBLED HATTERSLEY AND THAT IS ENOUGH TO PROVOKE ANY MAN YOU JUSTIFY IT THEN SAID HIS OPPONENT DARTING UPON HIM A MOST VINDICTIVE GLANCE
BUT THEN LIKE ALL OTHER GOOD THINGS IT MAY BE CARRIED TOO FAR
WHAT THE BOOK WAS THAT LAY OPEN ON THE TABLE BEFORE ME I CANNOT TELL FOR I NEVER LOOKED AT IT
BUT WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO ACT I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA
TO PROCEED THEN WITH THE VARIOUS INDIVIDUALS OF OUR PARTY
XL
TO LONDON REPLIED HE GRAVELY
I WISH RETURNED SHE WITH A SHORT LAUGH THAT ALL THE ATTRACTIVE POINTS AND DESIRABLE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE TWO GENTLEMEN WERE UNITED IN ONE--THAT LORD LOWBOROUGH HAD HUNTINGDON'S HANDSOME FACE AND GOOD TEMPER AND ALL HIS WIT AND MIRTH AND CHARM OR ELSE THAT HUNTINGDON HAD LOWBOROUGH'S PEDIGREE AND TITLE AND DELIGHTFUL OLD FAMILY SEAT AND I HAD HIM
AND IT WOULD BREAK YOUR HEART AT LAST TO FIND YOURSELF UNITED TO ONE SO WHOLLY INCAPABLE OF SHARING YOUR TASTES FEELINGS AND IDEAS--SO UTTERLY DESTITUTE OF SENSIBILITY GOOD FEELING AND TRUE NOBILITY OF SOUL HAVE YOU DONE ASKED MY COMPANION QUIETLY
FOR I FEARED MY FORCED CALMNESS WOULD LEAVE ME BEFORE THE END OF HIS DISCLOSURE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE
ARE YOU BEGINNING TO TIRE ALREADY
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT LORD LOWBOROUGH AND HIS DELECTABLE LADY THE CAUSE OF WHOSE SUDDEN DEPARTURE IS NO SECRET AMONGST THEM
HOW DO YOU REGARD ME AND AGAIN HE PRESSED MY HAND
AND I KNOW HER WISHES COINCIDE WITH YOURS
IF AGE AND DEATH MUST COME HE SPOKE THIS IN SUCH SERIOUS EARNEST THAT MY HEART BOUNDED WITH DELIGHT
FORGETTING FOR THE MOMENT ALL MY CARES LAUGHING AT HIS GLEEFUL LAUGHTER AND DELIGHTING MYSELF WITH HIS DELIGHT,--WHEN A SHADOW SUDDENLY ECLIPSED THE LITTLE SPACE OF SUNSHINE ON THE GRASS BEFORE US
HE TURNED FROM ME IN DISGUST
FOR I HAD NO INTEREST IN ANYTHING NOW
GIVE ME YOUR HAND AND I'LL BELIEVE YOU
I HAD SERIOUS THOUGHTS OF GETTING A PITCHER OF WATER AND EXTINGUISHING THAT LIGHT TOO
BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO IN THE COLD ROUGH WORLD ALONE
YESTERDAY MORNING ONE OF OCTOBER'S BRIGHTEST LOVELIEST DAYS MILICENT AND I WERE IN THE GARDEN ENJOYING A BRIEF HALF-HOUR TOGETHER WITH OUR CHILDREN WHILE ANNABELLA WAS LYING ON THE DRAWING-ROOM SOFA DEEP IN THE LAST NEW NOVEL
I GAVE IT TO HIM
HE MADE A LONG STAY IN THE DINING-ROOM AFTER DINNER AND I FEAR TOOK AN UNUSUAL QUANTITY OF WINE BUT NOT ENOUGH TO LOOSEN HIS TONGUE
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING FOR MILICENT?--TELL ME I'M NOT CRYING YOU ARE PERSISTED HE RUDELY PULLING HER HANDS FROM HER FACE
THOUGH WITH A DEGREE OF TIMIDITY THAT WITNESSED HIS FEAR TO OFFEND
I HAVE ARRANGED THE WHOLE PLAN IN MY HEAD
HE ALWAYS SAID I WAS A GOOD WIFE AND DID MY DUTY
MY EYES FOR THE MOST PART VACANTLY FIXED ON THE DEEP CHEQUERED SHADES RESTLESSLY PLAYING OVER THE BRIGHT SUNNY GRASS AT MY FEET WHERE NOW AND THEN A WITHERED LEAF OR TWO WOULD COME DANCING TO SHARE THE REVELRY
DON'T ELIZA SAID MISS MILLWARD SOMEWHAT GRUFFLY AS SHE IMPATIENTLY PUSHED HER AWAY
IF HIS FATHER GET WORSE I SHALL ASK ESTHER HARGRAVE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIM FOR A TIME TILL I HAVE REORGANISED THE HOUSEHOLD AT LEAST
ONE EVENING ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE VISITORS ARRIVAL I HAD RETIRED INTO THE LIBRARY TO SNATCH A FEW MINUTES RESPITE FROM FORCED CHEERFULNESS AND WEARISOME DISCOURSE FOR AFTER SO LONG A PERIOD OF SECLUSION DREARY INDEED AS I HAD OFTEN FOUND IT I COULD NOT ALWAYS BEAR TO BE DOING VIOLENCE TO MY FEELINGS AND GOADING MY POWERS TO TALK AND SMILE AND LISTEN AND PLAY THE ATTENTIVE HOSTESS OR EVEN THE CHEERFUL FRIEND
BUT HIS EYES FELL UPON ME AND HE KNEW ME ALTERED AS MY APPEARANCE MUST HAVE BEEN
HE WOULD HAVE ALL COMMUNION BETWEEN US TO BE ENTIRELY AT AN END AND HE WOULD BE RIGHT I SUPPOSE
THEREFORE IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE THE BAD OR THOSE WHICH TEND TO EVIL TILL THEY BECOME YOUR MASTERS AND NEGLECT THE GOOD TILL THEY DWINDLE AWAY YOU HAVE ONLY YOURSELF TO BLAME
BUT I AM FULLY DETERMINED MRS MARKHAM THAT MY DAUGHTERS--SHALL--NOT--CONSORT WITH HER
HE WANTS MY CHILD
ONE NIGHT HOWEVER DURING ONE OF OUR ORGIES--ONE OF OUR HIGH FESTIVALS I MEAN--HE GLIDED IN LIKE THE GHOST IN MACBETH AND SEATED HIMSELF AS USUAL A LITTLE BACK FROM THE TABLE IN THE CHAIR WE ALWAYS PLACED FOR THE SPECTRE WHETHER IT CHOSE TO FILL IT OR NOT
REFRESHED INVIGORATED IF NOT COMPOSED I ROSE AND RETURNED TO THE HOUSE
BUT I DESIRE NO THANKS SHE CONTINUED
TOWARDS MORNING MY DISTRACTING THOUGHTS BEGAN TO LOSE ALL PRETENSIONS TO COHERENCY AND SHAPE THEMSELVES INTO CONFUSED AND FEVERISH DREAMS AND AT LENGTH THERE FOLLOWED AN INTERVAL OF UNCONSCIOUS SLUMBER
ON RETURNING TO MY WINDOW I BEHELD ANOTHER CARRIAGE AT THE DOOR
I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF THEM FOR MY PART
AND I HAVE FOUND IT MY WISEST PLAN TO SHUT MY EYES AGAINST THE PAST AND FUTURE AS FAR AS HE AT LEAST IS CONCERNED AND LIVE ONLY FOR THE PRESENT
HOW COULD I REPLY
YOU SHOULD PLEAD FOR ME NO MAN CAN DELIVER HIS BROTHER NOR MAKE AGREEMENT UNTO GOD FOR HIM I REPLIED
IT'S NOT HONEST
HOW DISTINCTLY I REMEMBER OUR CONVERSATION THAT EVENING BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE FOR TOWN WHEN WE WERE SITTING TOGETHER OVER THE FIRE MY UNCLE HAVING GONE TO BED WITH A SLIGHT ATTACK OF THE GOUT
BUT IF THE BLOW FALL TOO SUDDENLY UPON YOU WHEN IT COMES REMEMBER I WISHED TO SOFTEN IT I LEFT HIM
SO THAT YOU SEE I HAD REASONS ENOUGH FOR DESPAIR IF I CHOSE TO INDULGE IT
DEATH IS SO TERRIBLE HE CRIED I CANNOT BEAR IT
I HAVE HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO OF LATE SAID I WITHOUT LOOKING UP FROM MY LETTER
YET GOD PRESERVE ME FROM IT AND HIM TOO
THAT WOULD BE A BREACH OF CONFIDENCE WOULDN'T IT HELEN
BUT THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT STILL
BUT HE'S DEAD NOW YOU'RE AWARE AND HAS LEFT IT ALL TO HIS NIECE ALL EVERY ROOD OF IT AND THE MANSION-HOUSE AND ALL
BUT YOU HAD BETTER BE QUICK ABOUT IT I CAN TELL YOU FOR--ALAS ALAS!--SHE'S GOING TO BE MARRIED NEXT THURSDAY NO MISS ELIZA THAT'S FALSE DO YOU CHARGE ME WITH A FALSEHOOD SIR YOU ARE MISINFORMED AM I
SO I GAVE HIM WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AN EVASIVE HALF NEGATIVE ANSWER
BUT TELL ME WHY I CANNOT BE ANYTHING MORE THERE WAS A PERPLEXED AND THOUGHTFUL PAUSE
HE WAS COMPLETELY ROUSED AND DETERMINED TO HAZARD ALL FOR VICTORY
I'M ONLY SORRY
THEN I WAS KNOCKING ABOUT THE WORLD NOW I AM AT HOME AND HOME WITHOUT YOU MY HOUSEHOLD DEITY WOULD BE INTOLERABLE YES AS LONG AS I AM NECESSARY TO YOUR COMFORT
FOR HER HOMELY FEATURES WORE AN EXPRESSION OF UNUSUAL CHEERFULNESS AND SERENITY AND SHE WAS STUDYING HIS PALE THOUGHTFUL FACE WITH GREAT COMPLACENCY WHEN WE ARRIVED
BROAD DAYLIGHT ILLUMINED THE APARTMENT FOR THE SUN WAS HIGH IN HEAVEN THOUGH OBSCURED BY ROLLING MASSES OF AUTUMNAL VAPOUR
EVEN IF I TOLD HIM ALL MY GRIEVANCES WHICH I SHOULD BE VERY RELUCTANT TO DO HE WOULD BE CERTAIN TO DISAPPROVE OF THE STEP
HER APPEARANCE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY CALCULATED TO PRODUCE A FAVOURABLE IMPRESSION AT FIRST SIGHT NOR DID HER MANNERS AND SUBSEQUENT CONDUCT IN ANY DEGREE REMOVE THE PREJUDICE I HAD ALREADY CONCEIVED AGAINST HER
I WISH WE KNEW EACH OTHER BETTER
THIS WAS WHAT THE PATIENT FAITHFUL LOVERS HAD PRIVATELY PLANNED AND QUIETLY WAITED FOR YEARS AGO
THEREFORE WITHOUT MORE ADO YOU SHALL HAVE IT
BUT HE WOULD DO HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF CALLING UPON HER TO-MORROW TO RECEIVE HER FURTHER COMMANDS I WAS GLAD TO ASCEND THE STERN-LOOKING STONE STAIRCASE AND LIE DOWN IN THE GLOOMY OLD-FASHIONED BED BESIDE MY LITTLE ARTHUR
THANK HEAVEN I AM NOT SO WEAK AS THAT
DO YOU REMEMBER ME SIR SAID HE
BUT I MUST HAVE EITHER TAKEN HIM WITH ME OR RELINQUISHED THE VISIT ALTOGETHER
THE THING THAT TROUBLES ME THE MOST AT PRESENT IS A YOUNG LADY SITTING AT MY ELBOW AND PREVENTING ME FROM FINISHING MY LETTER AND THEREAFTER REPAIRING TO MY DAILY BUSINESS BEFORE SHE COULD REPLY TO THIS UNGALLANT SPEECH ROSE ENTERED THE ROOM
WHO TOLD YOU THIS SAID SHE
MY ARTHUR SUPPORTING THE FEEBLER STEPS OF HER LITTLE HELEN AND SAGACIOUSLY POINTING OUT TO HER THE BRIGHTEST BEAUTIES OF THE BORDER AS THEY PASSED WITH SEMI-ARTICULATE PRATTLE THAT DID AS WELL FOR HER AS ANY OTHER MODE OF DISCOURSE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN OH NOTHING
BUT I'LL GET MR MILLWARD TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT:--HE'LL TELL YOU THE CONSEQUENCES;--HE'LL SET IT BEFORE YOU AS PLAIN AS THE DAY;--AND TELL YOU WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO AND ALL ABOUT IT;--AND I DON'T DOUBT HE'LL BE ABLE TO CONVINCE YOU IN A MINUTE NO OCCASION TO TROUBLE THE VICAR SAID MRS GRAHAM GLANCING AT ME--I SUPPOSE I WAS SMILING AT MY MOTHER'S UNBOUNDED CONFIDENCE IN THAT WORTHY GENTLEMAN--'MR MARKHAM HERE THINKS HIS POWERS OF CONVICTION AT LEAST EQUAL TO MR MILLWARD'S
MY POOR FATHER DIED LAST WEEK
THE DREADED TIME IS COME AND ARTHUR IS GONE AS I EXPECTED
BUT IF SHE'S NOT ENGAGED JUST ASK HER TO COME HERE A MINUTE
YOU WILL NOT DENY ME THAT CONSOLATION WE CAN HEAR OF EACH OTHER THROUGH MY BROTHER YOUR BROTHER A PANG OF REMORSE AND SHAME SHOT THROUGH ME
BUT THEN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HER I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THAT VERY EVENING THAT I VENTURED ON ANOTHER INVASION OF WILDFELL HALL
HIS FRIEND MR WILMOT WAS ONE AND MY AUNT'S FRIEND MR BOARHAM ANOTHER
SHE ONLY ALLUDES TO HIS CONDUCT IN THE MOST DELICATE TERMS AND MAKES EVERY EXCUSE FOR HIM THAT SHE CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF
AY
YOU SEE I HAVE EFFECTED SOME LITTLE IMPROVEMENT ALREADY CONTINUED SHE TURNING TO THE WINDOW
HE HAD FORCED HIMSELF NOT TO HATE HER AND EVEN PERHAPS TO FEEL SOME DEGREE OF KINDLY REGARD FOR HER AT LAST IN RETURN FOR HER ARTLESS AND UNSUSPECTING ATTACHMENT TO HIMSELF
BUT I CAN'T HELP IT
HER MOTHER SOUGHT OUT AN EXCELLENT MATCH FOR HER AND EVEN BROUGHT THE GENTLEMAN TO LAY HIS HEART AND FORTUNE AT HER FEET
AY AND SHE'LL FIND HIM HARDER AND CARELESSER NOR SHE THINKS ON YOU SEEM TO BE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIM I OBSERVED
BUT HOW AM I TO BLAME FOR IT
BUT I ONLY CLENCHED MY HANDS AND STAMPED MY FOOT UPON THE RUG
AND HAVING NOW LOOKED THROUGH THE PORTFOLIO I LEFT THEM TO THEIR TETE-A-TETE AND SEATED MYSELF ON A SOFA QUITE APART FROM THE COMPANY--NEVER THINKING HOW STRANGE SUCH CONDUCT WOULD APPEAR BUT MERELY TO INDULGE AT FIRST THE VEXATION OF THE MOMENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO ENJOY MY PRIVATE THOUGHTS
I CANNOT AFFORD TO PAINT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT MAMMA SENDS ALL HER PICTURES TO LONDON SAID ARTHUR
AND THE YOUNG UN--AT LEAST THE NEW UN SHE'S NONE SO VERY YOUNG)--IS COMING DOWN TO LIVE AT THE GROVE IS MR HARGRAVE MARRIED THEN AY SIR A FEW MONTHS SINCE
THIS WAS ONLY AN HOUR AFTER DINNER
AND PERHAPS SIR YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF CHECKMATED BEFORE YOU ARE AWARE
AND YOU MUST SEE THAT IT IS BETTER TO PART AT ONCE
I HAVE SEEN ESTHER HARGRAVE TWICE
AND SOME SAY SHE IS LADYLIKE AND AGREEABLE I THOUGHT HER SOMEWHAT FRIGID AND RATHER SUPERCILIOUS IN HER MANNER TO-DAY VERY LIKELY SHE MIGHT BE SO TO YOU
ENRAGED AT THIS HIS MASTER SNATCHED UP A HEAVY BOOK AND HURLED IT AT HIS HEAD
WE HAD NOT MET SINCE THE EVENING OF THE TEA-PARTY
THEIR BROTHER'S FATE WAS AN ELEMENT IN THE GENIUS OF EMILY AND CHARLOTTE WHICH THEY WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO ASSIMILATE WHICH MAY HAVE DONE THEM SOME HARM AND WEAKENED IN THEM CERTAIN DELICATE OR SANE PERCEPTIONS BUT WAS ULTIMATELY BY THE STRANGE ALCHEMY OF TALENT FAR MORE PROFITABLE THAN HURTFUL INASMUCH AS IT TROUBLED THE WATERS OF THE SOUL AND BROUGHT THEM NEAR TO THE MORE DESPERATE REALITIES OF OUR FRAIL FALL'N HUMANKIND BUT ANNE WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH HER GIFT WAS NOT VIGOROUS ENOUGH TO ENABLE HER THUS TO TRANSMUTE EXPERIENCE AND GRIEF
I THINK I MUST LIE DOWN A LITTLE
BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW AM I TO ALTER HIS PURPOSE
AND IF I WERE ALONE IN THE WORLD I HAVE STILL MY GOD AND MY RELIGION AND I WOULD SOONER DIE THAN DISGRACE MY CALLING AND BREAK MY FAITH WITH HEAVEN TO OBTAIN A FEW BRIEF YEARS OF FALSE AND FLEETING HAPPINESS--HAPPINESS SURE TO END IN MISERY EVEN HERE--FOR MYSELF OR ANY OTHER THERE NEED BE NO DISGRACE NO MISERY OR SACRIFICE IN ANY QUARTER PERSISTED HE
I GAVE IT A SPITEFUL SQUEEZE FOR I WAS ANNOYED AT THE CONTINUAL INJUSTICE SHE HAD DONE ME FROM THE VERY DAWN OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE
HE'LL BITE
BUT POOR ANNE BELIEVED HIS ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF AND NO DOUBT SAW ENOUGH EVIDENCE OF VICIOUS CHARACTER IN BRANWELL'S DAILY LIFE TO MAKE THE WORST ENORMITIES CREDIBLE
SHE'LL HATE YOU IF YOU DO--SHE WILL BY HEAVEN
I WAS OBLIGED AT LAST ALMOST ENTIRELY TO REMIT MY VISITS TO THE GROVE AT THE EXPENSE OF DEEPLY OFFENDING MRS HARGRAVE AND SERIOUSLY AFFLICTING POOR ESTHER WHO REALLY VALUES MY SOCIETY FOR WANT OF BETTER AND WHO OUGHT NOT TO SUFFER FOR THE FAULT OF HER BROTHER
BUT THE DOCTOR SAYS HE MAY NOW BE CONSIDERED OUT OF DANGER IF HE WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO OBSERVE THE NECESSARY RESTRICTIONS
THIS WAS NO TIME OR PLACE FOR EXPLANATION OR DISCOURSE
AND HE WALKED UP TO THE WINDOW AGAIN
AFTER ALL WHAT HAVE I DONE
BUT I AM QUITE SURE THAT IF YOU BEHAVE BETTER SHE WILL LOVE YOU MORE AND IF YOU BEHAVE WORSE SHE WILL LOVE YOU LESS AND LESS TILL ALL IS LOST IN FEAR AVERSION AND BITTERNESS OF SOUL IF NOT IN SECRET HATRED AND CONTEMPT
NEVERTHELESS I SURVEYED IT WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST
HOW CAN I HELP PLAYING THE DEUCE WHEN I SEE IT'S ALL ONE TO HER WHETHER I BEHAVE LIKE A CHRISTIAN OR LIKE A SCOUNDREL SUCH AS NATURE MADE ME
SO YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE THE HOUSE AT ONCE IF YOU CAME ONLY FOR THAT I DID NOT COME TO INSULT YOU
BUT SHE HAS NO OTHER SOCIETY SAVE THAT OF HER UNCONGENIAL MOTHER AND HER GOVERNESS AS ARTIFICIAL AND CONVENTIONAL A PERSON AS THAT PRUDENT MOTHER COULD PROCURE TO RECTIFY THE PUPIL'S NATURAL QUALITIES AND NOW AND THEN HER SUBDUED QUIET SISTER
BUT NOW HE HAS QUITE LOST SIGHT OF IT
I FELT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE ME COMFORTLESS
NOW MRS HUNTINGDON SAID HARGRAVE AS HE ARRANGED THE MEN ON THE BOARD SPEAKING DISTINCTLY AND WITH A PECULIAR EMPHASIS AS IF HE HAD A DOUBLE MEANING TO ALL HIS WORDS YOU ARE A GOOD PLAYER BUT I AM A BETTER
AND THIS I BELIEVE IS WHAT MOST OTHERS WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO REFLECTION AND WISHFUL TO STRIVE AGAINST THEIR NATURAL CORRUPTIONS YES SAID MY MOTHER BUT HALF APPREHENDING HER DRIFT
BUT THERE CAN BE NO EXCUSE FOR ANOTHER
AND I LEFT HIM MUTTERING MALEDICTIONS AGAINST HIS EVIL ANGEL
EVEN MY CONVERSATION WITH ELIZA HAD BEEN ENLIVENED BY HER PRESENCE THOUGH I KNEW IT NOT
A SLIGHT TWITCHING ABOUT THE MUSCLES OF THE MOUTH
AND THAT HE REALLY LOVES ME AND I MAY LOVE HIM AS DEVOTEDLY AND THINK OF HIM AS OFTEN AS I PLEASE
I WANT TO GO TO BED SAID I TAKING A CANDLE AND LIGHTING IT AT THE ONE SHE HELD IN HER HAND
BUT WHO IS THE COMPANION OF HER FLIGHT THUS YOU WILL HAVE NO CREDIT FOR YOUR VIRTUE IF YOU CALL IT SUCH
ARE THEY ALL COMING NO
NO WONDER HE SHOULD HUNGER AND THIRST TO HEAR HER SING
I WAS NOT SURE THAT I HAD DONE RIGHT IN SPEAKING SO HARSHLY TO HIM
PARTLY FROM THAT REMARKABLE IDIOSYNCRASY TO WHICH I HAVE BEFORE ALLUDED
IT WAS NO LONGER A CRIME TO THINK OF HER--BUT DID SHE EVER THINK OF ME
BUT ON THE MORROW THAT IS TO SAY IN PROPORTION AS HE RECOVERED FROM THE STATE OF EXHAUSTION AND STUPEFACTION HIS ILL-NATURE APPEARED TO REVIVE
BUT DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS ILLNESS WILL HAVE A FATAL TERMINATION I CANNOT TELL
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT IT IS A RESOLUTION YOU OUGHT TO HAVE FORMED LONG AGO WELL I'M NOT THIRTY YET
WILL YOU HAVE SOME WATER--SOME BRANDY
AND LOOKING UP I BEHELD WALTER HARGRAVE STANDING AND GAZING UPON US
BUT BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FROM THE SHOCK SUFFICIENTLY TO DEMAND AN EXPLANATION MILICENT ENTERED MY ROOM AS SHE FREQUENTLY DOES WHEN SHE IS DRESSED BEFORE ME
AND MEANTIME YOU WILL GO AND TALK ME OVER TO MRS HARGRAVE AND WRITE LONG LETTERS TO AUNT MAXWELL TO COMPLAIN OF THE WICKED WRETCH YOU HAVE MARRIED I SHALL COMPLAIN TO NO ONE
YOU MUST NOT COME AGAIN CONTINUED SHE
YOU ARE ONLY HALF A WOMAN--YOUR NATURE MUST BE HALF HUMAN HALF ANGELIC
WILL NOBODY BEFORE HE COULD FINISH THE SENTENCE I HAD POURED OUT A GLASS OF SOME ACIDULATED COOLING DRINK THAT WAS ON THE TABLE AND BROUGHT IT TO HIM
I KNOW IT IS THE CUSTOM FOR LADIES TO CRY ON THESE OCCASIONS BUT I COULDN'T SQUEEZE A TEAR FOR MY LIFE HE ONLY ANSWERED WITH A KISS AND PRESSED HER STILL CLOSER TO HIS BOSOM
BUT ONLY AFTER IT HAD PASSED THROUGH THAT INEFFABLE TRANSFORMATION THAT MYSTERIOUS INCOMMUNICABLE HEIGHTENING WHICH MAKES AND GIVES RANK IN LITERATURE
NOT CHOOSING TO ENGAGE WITH HIM I REFERRED HIM TO MILICENT
ARE YOU SO HAPPY THEN SAID SHE THOUGHTFULLY
I RAN IN AMONG THEM DEMANDING WITH BREATHLESS EAGERNESS HAD THE CEREMONY LONG COMMENCED
I SEE IT IN HER EYE HOLD YOUR TONGUE WILL YOU SAID I
AND BESIDES MY FUTURE WAY OF LIVING WILL BE SO WIDELY DIFFERENT TO THE PAST
SO I THOUGHT I'D FIND ANOTHER PLACE ARE WE NOT NEAR THE HOUSE SAID I INTERRUPTING HIM
THE THREATENED BLOW HAS NOT BEEN STRUCK YET AND I DO NOT GREATLY FEAR IT
ARE YOU GOING TO FORGIVE ME HELEN HE RESUMED MORE HUMBLY
I SHALL SHORTLY BE CALLED UPON TO ENTERTAIN THE SAME SELECT BODY OF FRIENDS AS WE HAD THE AUTUMN BEFORE LAST WITH THE ADDITION OF MR HATTERSLEY AND AT MY SPECIAL REQUEST HIS WIFE AND CHILD
AT ANY RATE IT WILL GIVE A BREATH OF EXCITEMENT TO THE LIFE SHE HAS DOOMED TO STAGNATION AND MAY CALM WITH CERTAINTY SOME AGITATING THOUGHTS I DID GO ON THE MORROW BUT NOT TILL TOWARDS EVENING AFTER THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY WAS CONCLUDED THAT IS BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN
IN THE FOURTH PLACE THIS TABLE MUST BE SPREAD FOR SOMEBODY AND AS SOLOMON SAYS WHO CAN EAT OR WHO ELSE CAN HASTEN HEREUNTO MORE THAN I AND FINALLY WITH YOUR LEAVE I'LL SIT DOWN AND SATISFY MY CRAVINGS OF TO-DAY AND LEAVE TO-MORROW TO SHIFT FOR ITSELF--WHO KNOWS BUT WHAT I MAY SECURE BOTH THIS AND THAT BUT YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO ABSTAIN FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL DINNER OF TO-DAY
APPLY TO MY BROTHER AND EXPLAIN MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND MY RESOLVES TO HIM
NO ARTHUR IT WAS NOT A DREAM THAT YOUR CONDUCT WAS SUCH AS TO OBLIGE ME TO LEAVE YOU
AND WHAT A PARADISE YOU LIVE IN IT IS A LOVELY EVENING ANSWERED I
FOR I'M QUITE IN THE DARK NOW ESTHER INTERPOSED MRS HARGRAVE WHO IF EQUALLY BENIGHTED ON THE SUBJECT OF OUR ESTRANGEMENT SAW AT LEAST THAT HER DAUGHTER WAS BEHAVING VERY IMPROPERLY I MUST INSIST UPON YOUR LEAVING THE ROOM PRAY DON'T MRS HARGRAVE FOR I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT MYSELF SAID I AND IMMEDIATELY MADE MY ADIEUX
WELL THERE'S NOTHING LIKE ACTIVE EMPLOYMENT I SUPPOSE TO CONSOLE THE AFFLICTED;--AND EXCUSE ME MR MARKHAM BUT YOU LOOK SO VERY FAR FROM WELL AND HAVE BEEN BY ALL ACCOUNTS SO MOODY AND THOUGHTFUL OF LATE,--I COULD ALMOST THINK YOU HAVE SOME SECRET CARE PREYING ON YOUR SPIRITS
WHAT FOR I ASKED
PLUCK IT HOWEVER SHE DID AND HAVING GENTLY DASHED THE GLITTERING POWDER FROM ITS LEAVES APPROACHED IT TO HER LIPS AND SAID
AND MY WELL-MEANT WARNING THOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE JUDICIOUSLY DELIVERED AS WELL AS MORE THANKFULLY RECEIVED WAS NOT WHOLLY UNPRODUCTIVE OF THE DESIRED EFFECT
AND THE LONGER HE STAYS THERE THE BETTER FOR ME
EARLY IN SPRING HE ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF GOING TO LONDON
YOU ARE NOT WITHOUT THE CAPACITY OF VENERATION AND FAITH AND HOPE AND CONSCIENCE AND REASON AND EVERY OTHER REQUISITE TO A CHRISTIAN'S CHARACTER IF YOU CHOOSE TO EMPLOY THEM
ANXIOUS AND PALE IT WAS TURNED TOWARDS ME
I THOUGHT I HAD WITNESSED ENOUGH OF MY HUSBAND'S DEGRADATION
PERCEIVING THAT I OBSERVED THE MOVEMENT HE WHISPERED THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A NOTE OF THE SERMON
TRANSCRIBED FROM THE 1920 JOHN MURRAY EDITION BY DAVID PRICE EMAIL CCX074@PGLAF.ORG PICTURE
YES WHO AM I PAPA ARE YOU GLAD TO SEE ME YES YOU'RE NOT REPLIED THE DISAPPOINTED PARENT RELAXING HIS HOLD AND DARTING A VINDICTIVE GLANCE AT ME
NO DARLING
LORD LOWBOROUGH HAS PROPOSED AND I HAVE BEEN GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO ACCEPT HIM
BUT HOW WAS SHE SITUATED
THEY WERE SAYING I KNOW RACHEL
BUT NOW YOU MUST LOOK TO YOURSELF I LEFT HIM MUTTERING BAD LANGUAGE TO HIMSELF AND WENT UP-STAIRS
IT IS NOT INDEED TO BE SUPPOSED THAT YOU WOULD WISH TO MARRY ANY ONE TILL YOU WERE ASKED
MRS GASKELL'S TOUCHING AND DELIGHTFUL TASK WAS READY FOR HER AND ANNE NO LESS THAN CHARLOTTE AND EMILY WAS SURE OF ENGLAND'S REMEMBRANCE
BUT THAT IF HE HAD KNOWN IT OR SHOULD AT ANY TIME BE MADE AWARE OF IT MOST CERTAINLY MR HUNTINGDON WOULD BE THE LAST PERSON TO WHOM HE SHOULD COMMUNICATE THE INTELLIGENCE
NO NO ARTHUR YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT
AND COULD I HAVE IMAGINED THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ENDURE IT AS CALMLY AND TO REPEL THEIR INSULTS AS FIRMLY AND AS BOLDLY AS I HAD DONE
THERE WAS LITTLE BUSINESS DONE THAT DAY YOU MAY BE SURE
SEND FOR MORE WINE
AS MOST OF THE COMPANY HAD TRAVELLED FAR THAT DAY THEY RETIRED EARLY TO REST
HE EXCUSED HIMSELF FROM GOING OUT TO SHOOT WITH THE OTHER GENTLEMEN IN THE MORNING UNDER THE PRETEXT OF HAVING LETTERS TO WRITE
BUT ONE DUTY MUST BE ATTENDED TO
I CALMLY DEFENDED OUR SEVERAL QUALIFICATIONS AS NURSE AND GOVERNESS AND STILL RESISTED THE PROPOSED ADDITION TO OUR FAMILY
BUT I WILL NOT HARASS YOU WITH FURTHER DETAILS
AND YOUR BUSINESS CANNOT OCCUPY ALL YOUR TIME
THAT LAUGHING EYE WHOSE SUNNY BEAM MY MEMORY WOULD NOT CHERISH LESS AND OH THAT SMILE
SHE COULD LIKE TO SEE EM MATCH IT WHEN IT WAS DONE SHE FONDLY STROKED IT AND GENTLY PATTED MY HEAD
IT SEEMS AS IF HARM COULD NOT REACH ME WHILE YOU ARE HERE
THE FINE GENTLEMAN AND BEAU OF THE PARISH AND ITS VICINITY IN HIS OWN ESTIMATION AT LEAST IS A YOUNG HERE IT ENDED
IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING I DROVE OVER TO THE GROVE WITH THE TWO LADIES TO GIVE MILICENT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BIDDING FAREWELL TO HER MOTHER AND SISTER
THE PLACE REPEATED SHE IN A TONE WHICH BETOKENED MORE DISPLEASURE OR DISAPPOINTMENT THAN SURPRISE
HOW YOU CAN LOVE SUCH A MAN I CANNOT TELL OR WHAT PLEASURE YOU CAN FIND IN HIS COMPANY
NOW THAT I KNOW YOU HAVE BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO I SHALL INSIST UPON YOUR ATTENDING TO IT AND LETTING ME ALONE
THE ACCUSATION AWOKE NEITHER SHAME NOR INDIGNATION IN HIM
THE FORMER BEING BROKEN AS WELL AS EXTINGUISHED HE RANG FOR ANOTHER
I SHUDDER AT THE THOUGHTS OF GOING DOWN TO BREAKFAST
A KEEN OBSERVATION OR A CHEERFUL WORD FROM HER HAD INSENSIBLY SHARPENED MY WITS AND THROWN AN INTEREST OVER ALL THAT WAS DONE AND SAID BY THE REST
THERE WAS NO SLEEP FOR ME HOWEVER THAT NIGHT AS I THOUGHT
CHAPTER XXV ON THE EIGHTH OF APRIL WE WENT TO LONDON ON THE EIGHTH OF MAY I RETURNED IN OBEDIENCE TO ARTHUR'S WISH
I WILL GO AT ONCE
A DREARY AMUSEMENT ENOUGH BUT HAVING THE AIR OF A USEFUL OCCUPATION AND BEING PURSUED AS A TASK IT WILL SUIT ME BETTER THAN A LIGHTER ONE
I TRUST MY SON WILL NEVER BE ASHAMED TO LOVE HIS MOTHER SAID MRS GRAHAM WITH A SERIOUS ENERGY THAT STARTLED THE COMPANY
HOW NICE AND SMOOTH THEY LOOK AND HOW SOFT AND EASY THEY FEEL TO THE FOOT
SOMETIMES IN PUBLIC SOMETIMES AT HOME
BUT ARTHUR WAS NOT ASLEEP
ONLY THERE IS MORE OF MALICE AND LESS OF PLAYFULNESS IN HER MANOEUVRES
AND I HAVE HAD NINE WEEKS EXPERIENCE OF THIS NEW PHASE OF CONJUGAL LIFE--TWO PERSONS LIVING TOGETHER AS MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AND FATHER AND MOTHER OF A WINSOME MERRY LITTLE CHILD WITH THE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS NO LOVE FRIENDSHIP OR SYMPATHY BETWEEN THEM
I'M NOT COME TO JOIN YOU
HE CALLED AGAIN MORE SHARPLY BUT DASH ONLY CLUNG THE CLOSER TO ME AND LICKED MY HAND AS IF IMPLORING PROTECTION
I'M BETTER SATISFIED WITH THE ONE I HAVE
AND HAVING HEARD THEM ALL AS I THOUGHT GO UP-STAIRS I VENTURED OUT TO GET MY CANDLESTICK FROM THE DRAWING-ROOM SIDEBOARD
BUT I AM TROUBLED CONTINUED SHE AND VEXED TOO FOR I THINK IT MY DUTY TO ACCOMPANY HIS LORDSHIP AND OF COURSE I AM VERY SORRY TO PART WITH ALL MY KIND FRIENDS SO UNEXPECTEDLY AND SO SOON AND YET ANNABELLA SAID ESTHER WHO WAS SITTING BESIDE HER I NEVER SAW YOU IN BETTER SPIRITS IN MY LIFE PRECISELY SO MY LOVE
HIS CONDUCT HAS OF LATE BEEN WHAT THE WORLD CALLS IRREPROACHABLE
THEY CAME THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
HE BEGGED I WOULD NOT INSIST UPON THIS
THE MOMENT HE ATTEMPTS TO DEMAND ANYTHING MORE HE WILL LOSE IT AGAIN
BUT STILL I TRUSTED HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE OUT THESE DIM TRACES TO HIS OWN SATISFACTION
BRILLIANT SUCCESS OF COURSE I DID NOT LOOK FOR BUT SOME DEGREE OF SECURITY FROM POSITIVE FAILURE WAS INDISPENSABLE
JUST BEFORE DINNER MY UNCLE CALLED ME INTO THE LIBRARY FOR THE DISCUSSION OF A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER WHICH WAS DISMISSED IN FEW WORDS
I WILL BE YOUR CONSOLER AND DEFENDER
BECAUSE YOU NEVER UNDERSTOOD ME OR YOU WOULD NOT SOON HAVE LISTENED TO MY TRADUCERS--MY CONFIDENCE WOULD BE MISPLACED IN YOU--YOU ARE NOT THE MAN I THOUGHT YOU
BLAKE HALL--SIDE GRASSDALE MANOR IT WAS ONE RAINY DAY LAST WEEK
WHAT DO YOU WANT SAID I FOLLOWING HER TO THE EMBRASURE OF THE WINDOW
25TH 1823.--ANOTHER YEAR IS GONE
WHAT YOU WON'T
THOSE WORDS CANNOT MAKE PEOPLE BE DAMNED NOR SHOW THAT THEY DESERVE IT
NOT ANOTHER WORD
WHEN THE BABY WAS BROUGHT I TRIED TO AMUSE HIM WITH THAT
AND I SAT DOWN AND WROTE A LONG LETTER TO MY AUNT OF COURSE TELLING HER NOTHING OF ALL THIS
THE RASCAL HAD NEVER TOLD ME HOW THAT PROPERTY WAS DISPOSED OR WHETHER MR HUNTINGDON HAD DIED INTESTATE OR NOT
AND IF YOU CHOOSE TO BEAR MALICE FOR IT AFTER ALL THE HANDSOME THINGS I'VE SAID DO SO AND BE D--D I WOULD REFRAIN FROM SUCH LANGUAGE IN A LADY'S PRESENCE AT LEAST SAID MR HARGRAVE HIDING HIS ANGER UNDER A MASK OF DISGUST
IF HE HAS WANDERED WHAT BLISS TO RECALL HIM
NAY I'VE DONE REPLIED THE OTHER
AND ARTHUR ALREADY WAS RUNNING TO MEET ME
HE KNEW NOT HOW HE COULD LIVE THROUGH THE WINTER WITH ME
THE SCENE INDEED WAS NOT REMARKABLY CHEERFUL IN ITSELF EITHER WITHIN OR WITHOUT
NO BUT WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT SHE INTENDS TO MARRY YOU DID SHE TELL YOU SO NO BUT THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO MAKE SUCH AN ASSERTION RESPECTING HER HE SLIGHTLY QUICKENED HIS PONY'S PACE BUT I LAID MY HAND ON ITS MANE DETERMINED HE SHOULD NOT LEAVE ME YET
FOR OF LATE HE HAS CONDUCTED HIMSELF TOWARDS ME WITH SUCH UNERRING PROPRIETY THAT I HAVE ALMOST FORGOTTEN HIS FORMER CONDUCT
SAY YOU HAVE NO THOUGHTS OF MATRIMONY AT PRESENT BUT I HAVE THOUGHTS OF IT OR THAT YOU DESIRE A FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE BUT I DON'T DESIRE A FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE--QUITE THE CONTRARY AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR FURTHER ADMONITIONS I LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT TO SEEK MR BOARHAM
YOU'RE VERY LATE WAS MY MORNING'S SALUTATION
THE SOFA WAS NOT FAR FROM THE DOOR BUT I DID NOT DARE TO RAISE MY HEAD FOR I KNEW MR HUNTINGDON WAS STANDING NEAR ME AND I KNEW BY THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE AS HE SPOKE IN ANSWER TO SOME REMARK OF LORD LOWBOROUGH'S THAT HIS FACE WAS TURNED TOWARDS ME
HOW COULD I BEAR MY FUTURE LIFE
WHEN MILICENT HAD GOT INTO HER ROOM I QUITTED MY POST A FEW MINUTES TO LOOK IN UPON HER AND HAVE A LITTLE PRIVATE CONVERSATION FOR SHE WAS NOW MY INTIMATE FRIEND SEVERAL LONG EPISTLES HAVING PASSED BETWEEN US SINCE OUR PARTING
BUT YOU'VE DRIVEN ME MAD WITH IT ALL RESPONDED HE WITH AN IMPATIENT TOSS
AND CONTRARY TO HER USUAL HABITS SHE SO HURRIED THE PREPARATIONS FOR REMOVAL AS MUCH FOR MY SAKE AS MY UNCLE'S I THINK THAT IN A VERY FEW DAYS WE DEPARTED
BUT NOW I'LL TELL YOU THAT IT DISTRESSES ME AND MAY DISGUST ME IF YOU GO ON AND SUFFER THE HABIT TO GROW UPON YOU AS IT WILL IF YOU DON'T CHECK IT IN TIME
HE LIKES TO HAVE ME NEAR HIM
THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM WAS ON A SWEET WARM EVENING WHEN I WAS SAUNTERING IN THE PARK WITH LITTLE ARTHUR AND RACHEL WHO IS HEAD-NURSE AND LADY'S-MAID IN ONE--FOR WITH MY SECLUDED LIFE AND TOLERABLY ACTIVE HABITS I REQUIRE BUT LITTLE ATTENDANCE AND AS SHE HAD NURSED ME AND COVETED TO NURSE MY CHILD AND WAS MOREOVER SO VERY TRUSTWORTHY I PREFERRED COMMITTING THE IMPORTANT CHARGE TO HER WITH A YOUNG NURSERY-MAID UNDER HER DIRECTIONS TO ENGAGING ANY ONE ELSE
BUT BEFORE I WAS HALF-WAY DOWN A SENTIMENT OF STRONG SYMPATHY FOR HER I HAD LEFT BEHIND ME HAD DISPLACED ALL OTHER FEELINGS AND SEEMED IMPERATIVELY TO DRAW ME BACK
HERE SHE PROCURED US A LIGHT ROUSED THE FIRE TO A CHEERFUL BLAZE AND SOON PREPARED A SIMPLE REPAST FOR OUR REFRESHMENT
SOME TIME BEFORE MR HUNTINGDON'S DEATH LADY LOWBOROUGH ELOPED WITH ANOTHER GALLANT TO THE CONTINENT WHERE HAVING LIVED A WHILE IN RECKLESS GAIETY AND DISSIPATION THEY QUARRELLED AND PARTED
LET ME GO I REPEATED QUIVERING WITH INDIGNATION
THE POOR DOG SET UP A PITEOUS OUTCRY AND RAN TO THE DOOR
HE WILL BE AWAY ALL DAY AND SO I WILL AMUSE MYSELF WITH MY NEGLECTED DIARY IF I CAN GIVE THAT NAME TO SUCH AN IRREGULAR COMPOSITION
BUT I WAS DETERMINED MY SON'S INTEREST SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN
YES YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GETTING IN MY HAY
DON'T BE TOO SEVERE UPON ME
I WOULD WAIT A LITTLE LONGER
BUT HE CRUSHED THEM ALL INTO HIS POCKET WITH A PRIVATE LAUGH AND SAID NOTHING TILL THE MEAL WAS CONCLUDED
WISH THE COMPANY WERE--GONE
WITH A HALF-AUTHORITATIVE HALF-DEPRECATING WAVE OF THE HAND HE SOUGHT TO DETER ME FROM RINGING
AND SO DID RICHARD WILSON THOUGH MY MOTHER EARNESTLY ENTREATED HIM TO DO SO AND EVEN OFFERED TO BE HIS PARTNER
I WOULD HAVE YOU TO FORTIFY YOURSELF AGAINST TEMPTATION AND NOT TO CALL EVIL GOOD AND GOOD EVIL
BUT THE BOLD KNIGHT CAN OVERLEAP THE REVEREND GENTLEMEN TAKING MY LAST BISHOP WITH HIS KNIGHT
MY HEART IS TOO THOROUGHLY DRIED TO BE BROKEN IN A HURRY AND I MEAN TO LIVE AS LONG AS I CAN WILL YOU LEAVE HIM THEN YES WHEN
ARE YOU INDEED
SHE LAID THE ROSE ACROSS MY PALM BUT I SCARCELY CLOSED MY FINGERS UPON IT SO DEEPLY WAS I ABSORBED IN THINKING WHAT MIGHT BE THE MEANING OF HER WORDS AND WHAT I OUGHT TO DO OR SAY UPON THE OCCASION
AND I THINK IF MY LITTLE WIFE WERE TO FOLLOW THE SAME PLAN IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR US BOTH I'LL TELL HER NO NO LET HER BE
HE HAD HEARD MY VOICE FALTER AND MIGHT HAVE SEEN ME BRUSH AWAY A TEAR
I WONDER WHETHER HE EVER THINKS OF ME
AND THEY ARE VERY USEFUL FOR MY LITTLE BOY TO RUN ABOUT IN ON RAINY DAYS WHEN HE CAN'T GO OUT
AFTER THAT ROSE FAVOURED ME WITH FURTHER PARTICULARS RESPECTING MRS GRAHAM
BUT HE ONLY LOOKED SILLY AND SAID NOTHING FOR THE SPACE OF HALF A MINUTE AND THEN MADE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO TURN THE CONVERSATION
AND I NEED SAY NO MORE TO JUSTIFY MY ALARM ON HIS ACCOUNT AND MY DETERMINATION TO DELIVER HIM AT ANY HAZARD FROM THE HANDS OF SUCH INSTRUCTORS
ONE WHO LOVED YOU LESS WOULD BE LESS BITTER LESS DISSATISFIED
PARTLY PERHAPS FROM TENDERNESS TO MY FEELINGS OR FEAR TO DISTURB MY PHILOSOPHY BY TOUCHING UPON THE INFECTIOUS THEME OF LOVE
WHAT A PLEASURE IT IS TO FIND YOU AT HOME MR MARKHAM SAID SHE WITH A DISINGENUOUSLY MALICIOUS SMILE
AND BENEATH IT A YOUNG GIRL WAS KNEELING ON THE DAISY-SPANGLED TURF WITH HEAD THROWN BACK AND MASSES OF FAIR HAIR FALLING ON HER SHOULDERS HER HANDS CLASPED LIPS PARTED AND EYES INTENTLY GAZING UPWARD IN PLEASED YET EARNEST CONTEMPLATION OF THOSE FEATHERED LOVERS--TOO DEEPLY ABSORBED IN EACH OTHER TO NOTICE HER
I LOOKED UP AT HIS FACE AND SAW THEREIN SUCH A LOOK OF GENUINE AGONY OF SOUL THAT WHETHER BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT OR WOUNDED PRIDE OR LINGERING LOVE OR BURNING WRATH WERE UPPERMOST I COULD NOT HESITATE TO PUT MY HAND IN HIS AS FRANKLY AS IF I BADE A FRIEND FAREWELL
I CAN ONLY SAY HE HATH HEDGED ME ABOUT THAT I CANNOT GET OUT
WE ARE TO HAVE TWO LADY VISITORS ALSO
HAVE I ATTEMPTED TO DEFRAUD YOU NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS
MRS GRAHAM HAD BROUGHT HER CHILD WITH HER AND ON MY MOTHER'S EXPRESSING SURPRISE THAT HE COULD WALK SO FAR SHE REPLIED,--'IT IS A LONG WALK FOR HIM
IF HE TOLD LIES I WOULD CONTRADICT HIM
I LOOKED AT THE BRIDEGROOM--IT WAS FREDERICK LAWRENCE
I WILL NOT ANNOY YOU WITH ANY MORE OF MY FRIENDLY IMPERTINENCES WELL I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO YOU HAVE YOU MENTIONED THIS AFFAIR TO HUNTINGDON ASKED SHE AS I WAS LEAVING THE ROOM
IS MR LEIGHTON A SWEET PREACHER HELEN--A DEAR DELIGHTFUL HEAVENLY-MINDED MAN HE IS A GOOD MAN MR HUNTINGDON
THANKS UNCLE FOR THAT AND ALL YOUR KINDNESS REPLIED I
I HAVE MET HER ONCE OR TWICE I REPLIED
THERE SHOULD BE NO SCENE--NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OR TO BOAST OF TO HIS COMPANIONS--NOTHING TO LAUGH AT WITH HIS LADY-LOVE
FOR FINDING I COULD NOT WELL RECOVER MY EQUANIMITY I PRESENTLY ROSE AND TOOK LEAVE EXCUSING MYSELF UNDER THE PLEA OF BUSINESS AT THE FARM
ARTHUR SAID SHE AT LENGTH COME HERE
AND TO THINK I OUGHT TO SACRIFICE MY PRIDE AND RENEW MY EFFORTS ONCE AGAIN TO MAKE HIS HOME AGREEABLE AND LEAD HIM BACK TO THE PATH OF VIRTUE
AND LEAVING HIM TO ENJOY HIS MERRIMENT ALONE I TOUCHED RUBY WITH THE WHIP AND CANTERED ON TO REJOIN OUR COMPANIONS
BUT NOBODY ELSE SHOULD SO DISPARAGE ARTHUR HUNTINGDON TO ME WITH IMPUNITY MISS WILMOT EXPRESSED HER FEELINGS ON THE SUBJECT ALMOST AS OPENLY
EVERYTHING I DID WAS WRONG
AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY SALUTING MR MILLWARD AS HE PASSED
YOU HAD BETTER RETIRE TO YOUR ROOM HELEN SAID MY AUNT GRAVELY
I AM AN EXCELLENT PHYSIOGNOMIST AND I ALWAYS JUDGE OF PEOPLE'S CHARACTERS BY THEIR LOOKS--NOT BY WHETHER THEY ARE HANDSOME OR UGLY BUT BY THE GENERAL CAST OF THE COUNTENANCE
AND THE CARRIAGE IS NOW COMING ROUND TO THE DOOR INLY APPROVING HIS PROMPTITUDE I BADE HIM GOOD-MORNING AND WITHDREW
CHAPTER XXIII FEB
IT WAS LITTLE ARTHUR IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED BY MY DOG SANCHO THAT WAS LYING AT MY FEET
BUT HOWEVER I SUPPOSE YOU MUST WEAR IT AWHILE FOR FORM'S SAKE
SHE IS TOO COOL AND CAUTIOUS AND TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH BOTH MY HUSBAND'S CHARACTER AND MY OWN TO BE IMPOSED UPON BY ANY SPECIOUS FALSEHOODS THE FORMER COULD INVENT
I CONSIDERED HER PRESENCE VERY USEFUL AS A CHECK UPON MY NATURAL IMPULSES--AN ANTIDOTE TO THOSE EMOTIONS OF TUMULTUOUS EXCITEMENT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE CARRIED ME AWAY AGAINST MY REASON AND MY WILL
MOREOVER SHE WAS BARELY CIVIL TO THEM AND EVIDENTLY BETTER PLEASED TO SAY GOOD-BY THAN HOW DO YOU DO BUT ELIZA MILLWARD SAYS HER FATHER INTENDS TO CALL UPON HER SOON TO OFFER SOME PASTORAL ADVICE WHICH HE FEARS SHE NEEDS AS THOUGH SHE IS KNOWN TO HAVE ENTERED THE NEIGHBOURHOOD EARLY LAST WEEK SHE DID NOT MAKE HER APPEARANCE AT CHURCH ON SUNDAY
I SHALL EXPECT MY HUSBAND TO HAVE NO PLEASURES BUT WHAT HE SHARES WITH ME
AND WHAT I SAY I MEAN
WAS IT A DREAM THAT AND HE COVERED HIS EYES WITH HIS HANDS AS IF TRYING TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY
WELL SIR RETURNED HIS HOST
AND THE MORE I LOVE HIM THE MORE THEY TROUBLE ME
SOME SUBTLE INNATE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN EYE AND BRAIN BETWEEN BRAIN AND HAND WAS PRESENT IN EMILY AND CHARLOTTE AND ABSENT IN ANNE
I WAS RATHER BUT IT'S OVER NOW
IMPOSSIBLE MR MARKHAM SAID SHE EVIDENTLY ASTONISHED AND ANNOYED
SHE DECLINED IT AND THUS OPENED THE CONFERENCE
IT IS ONLY MR LAWRENCE AND MISS WILSON SAID I COMING TO ENJOY A QUIET STROLL
FOR WHEN I TALKED CHEERFULLY TO HER SHE GRADUALLY BECAME MORE KIND AND CORDIAL AND WHEN I DEPARTED SHE BADE ME A GRACIOUS ADIEU HOPING ERE LONG TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ME AGAIN
POOR MILICENT I FEAR HAS ALREADY FALLEN A SACRIFICE TO THE MANOEUVRINGS OF THIS MISTAKEN MOTHER WHO CONGRATULATES HERSELF ON HAVING SO SATISFACTORILY DISCHARGED HER MATERNAL DUTY AND HOPES TO DO AS WELL FOR ESTHER
AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE HIM AND WAS CERTAIN HE WOULD LIKE YOU
BUT STILL TILL SUCH A TIME OF TRIAL COMES I WILL FORBEAR TO THINK OF MY QUIET ASYLUM IN THE BELOVED OLD HALL
HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THE GROUND
IT WAS NOW IN MY POWER TO CLEAR HER NAME FROM EVERY FOUL ASPERSION
IF YOU LOVED AS I DO SHE EARNESTLY REPLIED YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SO NEARLY LOST ME--THESE SCRUPLES OF FALSE DELICACY AND PRIDE WOULD NEVER THUS HAVE TROUBLED YOU--YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT THE GREATEST WORLDLY DISTINCTIONS AND DISCREPANCIES OF RANK BIRTH AND FORTUNE ARE AS DUST IN THE BALANCE COMPARED WITH THE UNITY OF ACCORDANT THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AND TRULY LOVING SYMPATHISING HEARTS AND SOULS BUT THIS IS TOO MUCH HAPPINESS SAID I EMBRACING HER AGAIN
AND THE VERY IDEA OF HAVING YOU TO CARE FOR UNDER MY ROOF WOULD FORCE ME TO MODERATE MY EXPENSES AND LIVE LIKE A CHRISTIAN--NOT TO SPEAK OF ALL THE PRUDENCE AND VIRTUE YOU WOULD INSTIL INTO MY MIND BY YOUR WISE COUNSELS AND SWEET ATTRACTIVE GOODNESS BUT IT IS NOT THAT SAID I
WHEN YOU FOUND HIM UTTERLY UNWORTHY OF THE TREASURE YOU RECLAIMED IT
SHE SAYS WHEN I AM SAFE OFF HER HANDS IT WILL BE SUCH A RELIEF TO HER MIND
I FOUND THE HOUSE IN SAD CONFUSION
DEAR DEAR WHAT A PITY!--HA HA HA
AND WHAT DID THEY SAY I PAUSED A MOMENT
I DISCLAIMED ALL TITLE TO IT TELLING HER HER HUSBAND WAS PREDISPOSED TO AMENDMENT BEFORE I ADDED MY MITE OF EXHORTATION AND ENCOURAGEMENT AND THAT I HAD ONLY DONE WHAT SHE MIGHT AND OUGHT TO HAVE DONE HERSELF
AND THERE ARE HER OWN THINGS TO DO AS WELL AS MINE AND ARTHUR'S
BUT OH
SHE'S A SWEET CREATURE
BUT I FORGAVE IT FROM A CONVICTION THAT IT ORIGINATED LESS IN PRIDE AND WANT OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS FRIENDS THAN IN A CERTAIN MORBID FEELING OF DELICACY AND A PECULIAR DIFFIDENCE THAT HE WAS SENSIBLE OF BUT WANTED ENERGY TO OVERCOME
I SAW NOTHING MORE OF HIM TILL THE FOLLOWING MORNING AT BREAKFAST WHEN HE CAME DOWN A FULL HOUR AFTER THE USUAL TIME
BUT IN SUCH IMPORTANT MATTERS I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF JUDGING FOR MYSELF
WHAT COULD YOU MEAN HELEN BY TAKING THE SERVANT'S PART AGAINST ME SAID ARTHUR AS SOON AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED WHEN YOU KNEW I WAS DISTRACTED I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE DISTRACTED ARTHUR
BUT I IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE ROOM AND FLEW TO THE NURSERY TO HIDE MY FEELINGS IF I COULD NOT SOOTHE THEM THERE
IF YOU KNEW ALL YOU TOO WOULD BLAME ME--PERHAPS EVEN MORE THAN I DESERVE--THOUGH I HAVE CRUELLY WRONGED YOU SHE ADDED IN A LOW MURMUR AS IF SHE MUSED ALOUD
DID EVER ANY MORTAL SEE SUCH EYES?--THEY SHINE IN THE DARK LIKE A CAT'S
YOU KNEW I WANTED HIM BY WHAT TOKEN I REPLIED
AND AS FOR HER OWN MISERY I RATHER FEEL IT THAN SEE IT EXPRESSED IN HER LETTERS BUT SHE ABUSES ME
AND CAN YOU BID ME GO SO COOLLY
FORMERLY THE SLIGHTEST HINT OR MERE FANCIED COLDNESS IN TONE OR GLANCE HAD SUFFICED TO REPULSE HIM
SET MY PILLOW STRAIGHT AND THESE CONFOUNDED BED-CLOTHES I DID SO
BUT TELL ME DID YOU MENTION THIS AFFAIR TO MY SISTER TO CONFESS THE TRUTH I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO DO SO
LOOKING UPON HIM WITH A COUNTENANCE LIVID WITH FURIOUS HATE LORD LOWBOROUGH MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS CLOSED TEETH A DEADLY EXECRATION HE WOULD NOT HAVE UTTERED HAD HE BEEN CALM ENOUGH TO CHOOSE HIS WORDS AND DEPARTED
GOOD-BY
HIS FATHER SWORE I HAD MADE THE CHILD HATE HIM AND ABUSED AND CURSED ME BITTERLY
HE DID NOT RETURN TILL TOWARDS THE LATTER END OF AUGUST
YOU WANT TO SCARE ME TO DEATH NO
I DEVOTED HALF AN HOUR TO DRESSING AND THEN RETURNED TO IT AGAIN
AND WAS I GLAD
CHAPTER XXX ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING I RECEIVED A FEW LINES FROM HIM MYSELF CONFIRMING HARGRAVE'S INTIMATIONS RESPECTING HIS APPROACHING RETURN
AND WHO BESIDES HARGRAVE FOR ONE
HE SHALL STAY MANY DAYS THIS TIME AND THERE SHALL BE MORE CANDOUR AND CORDIALITY BETWEEN US THAN EVER THERE WAS BEFORE SINCE OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD
HE IS COMING TO SEE ME SOON AND THEN I WILL MAKE THE PROPOSAL TO HIM HAVING FIRST ENLIGHTENED HIM UPON MY CIRCUMSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY TO EXCUSE THE PROJECT
AND THAT IS ANOTHER PRACTICE I DETEST HE LOOKED UP ASTONISHED AT MY WARMTH
BUT WHY SHOULD YOU FEAR IT BECAUSE MY DEAR BEAUTY IS THAT QUALITY WHICH NEXT TO MONEY IS GENERALLY THE MOST ATTRACTIVE TO THE WORST KINDS OF MEN
I HAD NO TIME TO THINK OF THEM HOWEVER
THINK HOW BUT I HATE HIM AUNT SAID I INTERRUPTING THIS UNUSUAL FLOW OF ELOQUENCE
AND I AM PERSUADED I SHALL SOON RECOVER NOW
LOWBOROUGH GLARED FIERCELY AT HIM FOR GRIMSBY WAS ALMOST AS CELEBRATED FOR HIS LUCK AS HE WAS FOR HIS ILL-FORTUNE
IT IS NOT LIKELY HE WOULD FALL FROM HIS HORSE AT ALL
AND THEN I COULD FANCY THERE AROSE A GLEAM OF HARD KEEN SOMBRE SATISFACTION IN HIS COUNTENANCE AT THE LOOK OF IMPOTENT WRATH AND ANGUISH HE WAS TOO CERTAIN TO BEHOLD IN MINE
AH,--HE DIDN'T SEE
NO SHE TURNED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND RE-ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM
BUT THERE WERE NO BROKEN BONES AND NO IMMEDIATE PROSPECTS OF DISSOLUTION
WHILE WE DISENCUMBERED OURSELVES OF OUR TRAVELLING-GEAR AND TOOK A HASTY SURVEY OF OUR NEW ABODE
LOWBOROUGH'S GOING TO GIVE US A SPEECH HE WAITED CALMLY TILL THE THUNDERS OF APPLAUSE AND JINGLING OF GLASSES HAD CEASED AND THEN PROCEEDED,--"IT'S ONLY THIS GENTLEMEN,--THAT I THINK WE'D BETTER GO NO FURTHER
IF I FOR HIS GOOD DENY HIM SOME TRIFLING INDULGENCE HE GOES TO HIS FATHER AND THE LATTER IN SPITE OF HIS SELFISH INDOLENCE WILL EVEN GIVE HIMSELF SOME TROUBLE TO MEET THE CHILD'S DESIRES
AND THEN TO GET RID OF HIM I MUTTERED AN INARTICULATE REPLY ACCOMPANIED BY A SULKY NOD
THEY THOUGHT I WAS SO MADLY INFATUATED BY THE SEDUCTIONS OF THAT UNHAPPY LADY THAT I WAS DETERMINED TO SUPPORT HER IN THE VERY FACE OF REASON
AND AS FOR HIS TASTES AND OCCUPATIONS THEY ARE QUITE BEYOND ME--LONELY WANDERER AS I AM
BUT NEITHER THE DOCTOR NOR I CAN SPEAK WITH CERTAINTY IN SUCH A CASE
I NOW KNOW THAT WITH HIM DAYS SIGNIFY WEEKS AND WEEKS MONTHS
BUT HER SMILE HAD ANIMATED MY MIRTH
WHEN I CALLED ON THEM HE ALWAYS HAPPENED TO BE AT HOME AND WHEN THEY CALLED ON ME IT WAS ALWAYS HE THAT DROVE THEM OVER IN THE PHAETON
HOWEVER THAT MIGHT BE SHE CERTAINLY DID NOT GIVE MUCH PLEASURE TO THE COMPANY;--NOR DID SHE APPEAR TO DERIVE MUCH FROM IT
BUT TO BE TREATED LIKE A BABY OR A FOOL WAS ENOUGH TO PUT ANY MAN PAST HIS PATIENCE AND DRIVE HIM TO ASSERT HIS INDEPENDENCE EVEN AT THE SACRIFICE OF HIS OWN INTEREST
AND EVERY LITTLE THING I DO FOR YOU IS ASCRIBED TO SELF-RIGHTEOUS MALICE AND REFINED REVENGE IT'S ALL VERY FINE I DARESAY SAID HE EYEING ME WITH STUPID AMAZEMENT
I LINGERED A FEW MINUTES TO SEE THE PLACE BUT WAS FULLY RESOLVED TO RETURN TO M WITHOUT SEEING ITS MISTRESS AND IF MY AUNT AND I HAD NOT BEEN JUST RETURNING FROM OUR MORNING DRIVE I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AND HEARD NO MORE OF YOU I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR BOTH THAT WE SHOULD NOT MEET REPLIED I AS CALMLY AS I COULD BUT NOT DARING TO SPEAK ABOVE MY BREATH FROM CONSCIOUS INABILITY TO STEADY MY VOICE AND NOT DARING TO LOOK IN HER FACE LEST MY FIRMNESS SHOULD FORSAKE ME ALTOGETHER
ALWAYS SPENDING THE INTERIM IN THE LIBRARY WHICH I TAKE CARE TO HAVE LIGHTED FOR HIS ACCOMMODATION
AND THEN INDEED I DEEPLY REGRETTED MY STUPIDITY AND MY FOOLISH PRIDE BUT IT WAS NOW TOO LATE TO REMEDY THE EVIL
IS THERE ANYTHING FOR ME I ASKED
YES;--I KNOW YOU HATE ME FOR MY IMPERTINENCE BUT I DON'T CARE IF IT ONLY CONDUCES TO PRESERVE YOU FROM THAT FATAL MISTAKE WELL RETURNED HE WITH A RATHER WINTRY SMILE--'I'M GLAD YOU HAVE OVERCOME OR FORGOTTEN YOUR OWN AFFLICTIONS SO FAR AS TO BE ABLE TO STUDY SO DEEPLY THE AFFAIRS OF OTHERS AND TROUBLE YOUR HEAD SO UNNECESSARILY ABOUT THE FANCIED OR POSSIBLE CALAMITIES OF THEIR FUTURE LIFE WE PARTED--SOMEWHAT COLDLY AGAIN
BUT IF YOU WOULD REALLY STUDY MY PLEASURE MOTHER YOU MUST CONSIDER YOUR OWN COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE A LITTLE MORE THAN YOU DO--AS FOR ROSE I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE'LL TAKE CARE OF HERSELF
BUT THE MONOSYLLABLES YES OR NO OR HUMPH WERE THE UTMOST HER SEVERAL REMARKS COULD ELICIT FROM ME
I HAD FLATTERED MYSELF THAT I HAD SO EFFECTUALLY REPULSED HIS ADVANCES ON ALL FORMER OCCASIONS THAT I HAD NOTHING MORE TO APPREHEND FROM HIS UNFORTUNATE PREDILECTION
HE NEVER OFFERED TO SHOW ME HIS SISTER'S LETTERS NOW AND I NEVER HINTED A WISH TO SEE THEM
SHE TALKED TO ME AND LAUGHED AND ROMPED WITH LITTLE ARTHUR HER LOVED AND LOVING PLAYMATE
FOR THE LAST FALL OF SNOW WAS ONLY JUST WASTED AWAY LEAVING YET A THIN RIDGE HERE AND THERE LINGERING ON THE FRESH GREEN GRASS BENEATH THE HEDGES
NOW THIS IS THE THING CRIED HE POURING OUT A GLASS OF THE SAME IN A LONG STREAM SKILFULLY DIRECTED FROM THE JUG TO THE TUMBLER SO AS TO PRODUCE MUCH FOAM WITHOUT SPILLING A DROP
COULD I EVER HAVE IMAGINED THAT I SHOULD BE DOOMED TO BEAR SUCH INSULTS UNDER MY OWN ROOF--TO HEAR SUCH THINGS SPOKEN IN MY PRESENCE
FOR I DON'T LIKE TO SIT BY MRS GRAHAM
THERE WAS A LOOK OF GUILE AND SUBTLETY IN HER FACE A SOUND OF IT IN HER VOICE
IT WAS NOT FOR LORD LOWBOROUGH--IT WAS NOT FOR ANNABELLA--IT WAS NOT FOR MYSELF--IT WAS FOR ARTHUR HUNTINGDON THAT THEY ROSE
BUT BEFORE THAT FUNCTIONARY COULD DESCEND FROM HIS BOX A HAND WAS SILENTLY PUT FORTH FROM THE CARRIAGE WINDOW
BUT I SAW THAT HE FOLLOWED THEM WITH A GLARE OF HUNGRY REGRET AS THEY DEPARTED
WHO TOLD YOU
BUT STILL WHEN I OMITTED WRITING HE COMPLAINED OF MY NEGLECT
AND HE HAS NONE BUT HIMSELF AND HIS VICES TO THANK FOR IT
BUT I WAS NOT GOING TO RESTRICT MYSELF TO ANY PARTICULAR POSITION FOR HER
BUT HE POOR FOOL DELUDES HIMSELF WITH THE NOTION THAT SHE'LL MAKE HIM A GOOD WIFE AND BECAUSE SHE HAS AMUSED HIM WITH SOME RODOMONTADE ABOUT DESPISING RANK AND WEALTH IN MATTERS OF LOVE AND MARRIAGE HE FLATTERS HIMSELF THAT SHE'S DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO HIM
AND FOUR YEARS LATER EMILY SAYS THE GONDALS STILL FLOURISH BRIGHT AS EVER
THE FRAME HOWEVER IS HANDSOME ENOUGH
I WATCH AND RESTRAIN HIM AS WELL AS I CAN AND OFTEN GET BITTERLY ABUSED FOR MY RIGID SEVERITY
AND SURELY GOD IN HIS MERCY WILL PRESERVE ME FROM SO SEVERE A TRIAL
BAY YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT I SUPPOSE MRS GRAHAM
AND MORE-OVER HE DID NOT SCRUPLE TO TELL ME THAT THERE WERE LADIES IN BOTH PLACES THAT WOULD TEAR HIS EYES OUT IF THEY HAPPENED TO MEET HIM WITH ME
AND HENCE I MUST BE AND I AM DEBASED CONTAMINATED BY THE UNION BOTH IN MY OWN EYES AND IN THE ACTUAL TRUTH
BUT I HAVE NOT SPENT MY SOLITUDE IN UTTER IDLENESS AND I AM NOT SPEAKING NOW FROM THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT AS YOU DO
AND SO ON FROM DAY TO DAY TILL HIS CLAMOROUS CONSCIENCE BROUGHT HIM TO A STAND
AND IF YOU CHOOSE TO VISIT THE BOTTOMLESS PIT I WON'T GO WITH YOU--WE MUST PART COMPANY FOR I SWEAR I'LL NOT MOVE ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS IT!--WHAT'S THIS HE SAID TAKING UP HIS GLASS OF WINE
HE STEPPED BACK
WHETHER IT WAS TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH MY AUNT I CANNOT TELL BUT IF SO HE CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE BEHAVED BETTER
BUT WHAT WOULD FREDERICK HAVE BEEN IF HE HAD LIVED IN THE WORLD AND MINGLED FROM HIS CHILDHOOD WITH SUCH MEN AS THESE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE
IF I DID WRONG LOVE ALONE WAS MY INCENTIVE AND THE PUNISHMENT WAS SEVERE ENOUGH
I SHOULD ONLY HAVE BOTHERED HIM BY MY CLUMSY EFFORTS AT PERSUASION IF I HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT YOU NEVER TRIED ME MILLY SAID HE
AND ALTOGETHER SHE WAS RATHER CHARMING THAN PRETTY
BUT IT WOULD NOT DO
BUT IT WOULD NOT DO
IT IS A VERY INDISCREET QUESTION I KNOW SHE HASTENED TO ADD
HE DRANK IT GREEDILY BUT MUTTERED AS I TOOK AWAY THE GLASS,--'I SUPPOSE YOU'RE HEAPING COALS OF FIRE ON MY HEAD YOU THINK NOT NOTICING THIS SPEECH I ASKED IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE I COULD DO FOR HIM
THEREFORE MR FERGUS IF YOU CHOOSE TO ENTER MY HOUSE AS A FRIEND I WILL MAKE YOU WELCOME
BUT I BADE HIM SAY I SHOULD NOT TAKE ANY TO-NIGHT AND HAPPILY SHE WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HER GUESTS TO MAKE ANY FURTHER INQUIRIES AT THE TIME
I DID MY BEST TO SOOTHE AND COMFORT HIM
I SHUDDER TO THINK OF HER BEING AWAKENED LIKE ME TO A SENSE OF THEIR DELUSIVE VANITY
BUT SOON I BEGAN TO WEARY OF ITS MINGLED TURBULENCE AND CONSTRAINT AND SIGH FOR THE FRESHNESS AND FREEDOM OF HOME
FOR THERE WAS STILL ONE THING ABOUT HIM THAT I DID NOT GIVE UP IN DESPAIR AND ONE EFFORT FOR HIS PRESERVATION THAT I WOULD NOT REMIT
I WAS OUT ON THE HILL WITH THE REAPERS
IT'S JUST TO EXCHANGE A SHOT WITH HIM AND THEN YOU'LL FEEL YOURSELF ALL RIGHT AGAIN
I SHALL THEREFORE REMIT THESE DUTIES WHEN MY BONDAGE BECOMES INTOLERABLE THIS THREAT I THOUGHT WOULD SERVE TO KEEP HIM IN CHECK IF ANYTHING WOULD
MY AFFECTIONS NOT ONLY OUGHT TO BE FOUNDED ON APPROBATION BUT THEY WILL AND MUST BE SO
BENSON YOUR MISTRESS HAS BROKEN THE CANDLE
ESTHER THIS IS MR MARKHAM
YOU ARE--VERY MUCH SO NO MRS HUNTINGDON I ONLY OUGHT TO BE DO YOU MEAN TO MAINTAIN THAT YOU HAVE THE SAME REGARD FOR ME THAT YOU HAD WHEN LAST WE MET I HAVE
BUT AT LEAST I CAN TRY TO BE WORTHY OF IT AND THEN I TURNED THE CONVERSATION
BUT AS I WAS NOT A VERY ATTENTIVE LISTENER I COULD NOT REPEAT THE DESCRIPTION IF I WOULD
BUT NOT TO-DAY--TO-MORROW NO TO-DAY
ON HOUSEHOLD MATTERS AND ALL THE LITTLE NICETIES OF COOKERY AND SUCH THINGS THAT EVERY LADY OUGHT TO BE FAMILIAR WITH WHETHER SHE BE REQUIRED TO MAKE A PRACTICAL USE OF HER KNOWLEDGE OR NOT
THE NEXT DAY MY MOTHER AND ROSE HASTENED TO PAY THEIR COMPLIMENTS TO THE FAIR RECLUSE
AND I BY MY ACRIMONIOUS RESENTMENT--SO SERIOUS SO DISPROPORTIONED TO THE OFFENCE--HAVE SO WOUNDED HIS FEELINGS SO DEEPLY OFFENDED HIM THAT I FEAR HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME--AND ALL FOR A MERE JEST
I HAD BARELY SUFFICIENT REMAINING FOR THE PROBABLE EXPENSES OF THE JOURNEY
BUT COURAGE
HE WAS A MAN OF FIXED PRINCIPLES STRONG PREJUDICES AND REGULAR HABITS INTOLERANT OF DISSENT IN ANY SHAPE ACTING UNDER A FIRM CONVICTION THAT HIS OPINIONS WERE ALWAYS RIGHT AND WHOEVER DIFFERED FROM THEM MUST BE EITHER MOST DEPLORABLY IGNORANT OR WILFULLY BLIND
THE LIPS--A LITTLE TOO VOLUPTUOUSLY FULL--SEEMED READY TO BREAK INTO A SMILE
I'LL MURDER YOUR BIRDS BY WHOLESALE JUST FOR KEEPING ME AWAY FROM BETTER COMPANY THAN EITHER YOU OR THEM AND SO SAYING HE DEPARTED
NAME TIME AND PLACE AND I'LL MANAGE THE REST THAT ANSWERED THE MORE LOW DELIBERATE VOICE OF LORD LOWBOROUGH IS JUST THE REMEDY MY OWN HEART OR THE DEVIL WITHIN IT SUGGESTED--TO MEET HIM AND NOT TO PART WITHOUT BLOOD
AND I WILL GO TO BED AND TRY TO WIN TIRED NATURE'S SWEET RESTORER
IT'S SUNDAY TO-DAY ISN'T IT
AND WHEN I DID STEP FORWARD SHE STOOD STILL AND SEEMED INCLINED TO TURN BACK AS IT WAS
AND WHEN I HEARD MY MOTHER AND SISTER SO FEELINGLY DEPLORING HIS CONDITION I HAD CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN PREVENTING MYSELF FROM TELLING THEM THE REAL EXTENT OF THE INJURIES AS FAR AS I KNEW THEM
BUT AT LENGTH HE BEGAN TO RELAX HIS VIRTUOUS EFFORTS AND NOW AND THEN EXCEEDED A LITTLE AND STILL CONTINUES TO DO SO
IS SHE GONE THEN NO
SHE IS A CHARMING CREATURE BUT SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD A WILL OF HER OWN AND COULD PLAY THE VIXEN UPON OCCASION I THOUGHT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE MAN BUT I DIDN'T SAY SO I MUST HAVE SOME GOOD QUIET SOUL THAT WILL LET ME JUST DO WHAT I LIKE AND GO WHERE I LIKE KEEP AT HOME OR STAY AWAY WITHOUT A WORD OF REPROACH OR COMPLAINT
A FAINT RED LIGHT WAS GLEAMING FROM THE LOWER WINDOWS OF ONE WING BUT ALL THE OTHER WINDOWS WERE IN DARKNESS AND MANY EXHIBITED THEIR BLACK CAVERNOUS GULFS ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF GLAZING OR FRAMEWORK
AS I MAY NEVER HAVE OCCASION TO MENTION HER AGAIN I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU HERE THAT SHE WAS AT THIS TIME PRIVATELY ENGAGED TO RICHARD WILSON--A SECRET I BELIEVE TO EVERY ONE BUT THEMSELVES
ANNE BRONTE FROM A DRAWING BY CHARLOTTE BRONTE IN THE POSSESSION OF THE REV
THE DEEP ENCIRCLING WOODS
ARE THESE YOURS SAID HE CARELESSLY TAKING UP ONE OF THE DRAWINGS
ARE YOU SURE ARTHUR
PRIDE REFUSES TO AID ME
BUT NOW THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER OUTWARD SEEMING AND HER INWARD MIND AS I SUPPOSED,--BETWEEN MY FORMER AND MY PRESENT OPINION OF HER WAS SO HARROWING--SO DISTRESSING TO MY FEELINGS THAT IT SWALLOWED UP EVERY LIGHTER CONSIDERATION
BUT EVEN THEN THE DOOR IS LEFT AJAR THAT HE MAY KNOW ME TO BE WITHIN CALL
I WILLINGLY COMPLIED
DECEMBER WAS PAST
THE SECOND OBJECT OF HIS CHOICE WAS WIDELY DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST
THE MUTE BIRD SITTING ON THE STONE THE DANK MOSS DRIPPING FROM THE WALL THE THORN-TREES GAUNT THE WALKS O'ERGROWN I LOVE THEM--HOW I LOVE THEM ALL
AT PRESENT I AM PLEASED WITH ARTHUR
I--I CAME TO SEE THE PLACE FALTERED I
IT MEANS DESTITUTE OF PRINCIPLE AND PRONE TO EVERY VICE THAT IS COMMON TO YOUTH BUT I'VE HEARD UNCLE SAY HE WAS A SAD WILD FELLOW HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS YOUNG SHE STERNLY SHOOK HER HEAD
COME I AM IN HELL'S TORMENTS TILL YOU SPEAK THE WORD I DID NOT SPEAK IT BUT I PUT MY HAND ON HIS SHOULDER AND KISSED HIS FOREHEAD AND THEN BURST INTO TEARS
HIS EYES WERE HALF CLOSED UNTIL HE BECAME SENSIBLE OF MY PRESENCE--AND THEN HE OPENED THEM WIDE ENOUGH
IF YOU ARE AT ALL INTERESTED IN THE FATE OF THAT LOW SCOUNDREL GRIMSBY I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT HE WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE SINKING FROM BATHOS TO BATHOS OF VICE AND VILLAINY CONSORTING ONLY WITH THE WORST MEMBERS OF HIS CLUB AND THE LOWEST DREGS OF SOCIETY--HAPPILY FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD--AND AT LAST MET HIS END IN A DRUNKEN BRAWL FROM THE HANDS IT IS SAID OF SOME BROTHER SCOUNDREL HE HAD CHEATED AT PLAY
AND LAWRENCE DID SHE--DID YOUR SISTER MENTION ME SHE ASKED IF I HAD SEEN YOU LATELY AND WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY I CANNOT TELL YOU ALL SHE SAID REPLIED HE WITH A SLIGHT SMILE
IT WILL DO YOU NO HARM TO ABSENT YOURSELF AGAIN FOR A WHILE--IF THAT BE REALLY NECESSARY IF THAT BE REALLY POSSIBLE HE MUTTERED
I SHOULD REJOICE TO SEE YOU AT ANY TIME SO DEEPLY ABSORBED IN YOUR DEVOTIONS THAT YOU HAD NOT A SINGLE THOUGHT TO SPARE FOR ME
I WAS BEGINNING INSENSIBLY TO CHERISH VERY UNAMIABLE FEELINGS AGAINST MY FELLOW-MORTALS THE MALE PART OF THEM ESPECIALLY
I'VE SEEN HER ALREADY SAID HE QUIETLY
FOR I STILL THOUGHT PROPER TO DEVOTE SOME PORTION OF EVERY DAY EXCLUSIVELY TO HIS INSTRUCTION AND AMUSEMENT
CHAPTER XXVIII DECEMBER 25TH.--LAST CHRISTMAS I WAS A BRIDE WITH A HEART OVERFLOWING WITH PRESENT BLISS AND FULL OF ARDENT HOPES FOR THE FUTURE THOUGH NOT UNMINGLED WITH FOREBODING FEARS
YOU WERE RIGHT
AND EVERY FRIEND WOULD TELL US IT WAS OUR INTEREST AS WELL AS OUR DUTY TO FORGET EACH OTHER THOUGH WE MIGHT NOT SEE IT OURSELVES
BUT THERE IS NO OTHER TO SUPPLY MY PLACE
WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME OF THIS I SAID REPROACHFULLY PRETENDING A RESENTMENT I DID NOT FEEL FOR IN TRUTH I WAS ALMOST WILD WITH JOY TO FIND MYSELF SO HAPPILY MISTAKEN AND OVERFLOWING WITH AFFECTION TO HIM FOR THIS AND FOR THE BASE INJUSTICE I FELT THAT I HAD DONE HIM IN MY MIND--HE MIGHT HAVE WRONGED ME BUT NOT TO THAT EXTENT
AND SOMETIMES SHE PROVOKES ME BY CRYING FOR NOTHING AND WON'T TELL ME WHAT IT'S FOR
YOU ARE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM
BUT THE MAMMAS WERE STILL UNRELENTING
HOW I HAD STUDIED AND TOILED TO PRODUCE SOMETHING AS I THOUGHT WORTHY OF THE ORIGINAL
NOTHING TOLD ME THEN THAT SHE A FEW YEARS HENCE WOULD BE THE WIFE OF ONE ENTIRELY UNKNOWN TO ME AS YET BUT DESTINED HEREAFTER TO BECOME A CLOSER FRIEND THAN EVEN HERSELF MORE INTIMATE THAN THAT UNMANNERLY LAD OF SEVENTEEN BY WHOM I WAS COLLARED IN THE PASSAGE ON COMING DOWN AND WELL-NIGH JERKED OFF MY EQUILIBRIUM AND WHO IN CORRECTION FOR HIS IMPUDENCE RECEIVED A RESOUNDING WHACK OVER THE SCONCE WHICH HOWEVER SUSTAINED NO SERIOUS INJURY FROM THE INFLICTION
FOR IF AT FIRST HER OPINION OF ME HAD BEEN LOWER THAN I DESERVED I WAS CONVINCED THAT NOW MY DESERTS WERE LOWER THAN HER OPINION
BUT SINCE YOU HAVE HEARD MY CONFESSION YOU MUST HEAR MY JUSTIFICATION AS WELL A FEW OF THE EXCUSES AT LEAST WHEREWITH I SOUGHT TO PACIFY MY OWN ACCUSING CONSCIENCE
IT WOULD SEEM LIKE MADNESS TO HIM AS IT WOULD TO MY UNCLE AND AUNT OR TO MILICENT
BUT WE WALKED SLOWLY AND WENT ON TALKING AS WE PROCEEDED
MILICENT HAS JUST LOOKED IN TO ASK ME HOW I WAS
AND SHE WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY A RESPECTABLE OLD DOWAGER
OH HEAVENS
BUT NO PARTICULAR TEMPTATION HAS YET OCCURRED TO PUT HIS VIRTUE TO THE TEST
PERHAPS FEW PEOPLE GAIN THEIR LIVELIHOOD WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE IN THEIR TOIL AS I DO
I WAS RATHER ANXIOUS TO SEE HOW HE WOULD MEET ME IN THE MORNING AND NOT A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED TO BEHOLD HIM ENTER THE BREAKFAST-ROOM WITH A CARELESS SMILE
AND WHEN HE AND I WERE ALONE TOGETHER--WHICH I CONTRIVED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BY BRINGING HIM OUT TO LOOK AT MY CORNSTACKS--HE SHOWED ME ANOTHER LETTER FROM HIS SISTER
MY COMPANION GRAVELY TOOK MY ARM AND LEADING ME AWAY TO THE GARDEN THUS ANSWERED MY QUESTION,--'SHE IS AT GRASSDALE MANOR IN SHIRE WHERE CRIED I WITH A CONVULSIVE START
WHERE ARE THEY SAID HE
IF TRUE TOO HUMILIATING A FACT TO BE THUS OPENLY CAST IN HIS TEETH
THEN IN ANOTHER PAROXYSM OF SHUDDERING HORROR HE TIGHTENED HIS GRASP ON MY HAND AND ARM AND GROANING AND LAMENTING STILL CLUNG TO ME WITH THAT WILD DESPERATE EARNESTNESS SO HARROWING TO MY SOUL BECAUSE I KNOW I CANNOT HELP HIM
AND SHE'S EXCESSIVELY PRETTY--HANDSOME RATHER--YOU MUST SEE HER GILBERT
AND INSTEAD OF RETIRING FOR THAT PURPOSE INTO THE LIBRARY HE SENT FOR HIS DESK INTO THE MORNING-ROOM WHERE I WAS SEATED WITH MILICENT AND LADY LOWBOROUGH
THEIR TASTES AND OCCUPATIONS ARE SIMILAR TO HIS AND I DON'T SEE WHY HIS CONDUCT SHOULD AWAKEN EITHER THEIR INDIGNATION OR SURPRISE YOU WRONG ME CRUELLY ANSWERED HE
I SAY REPLIED I CALMLY THAT WHAT HE PRIZES SO LIGHTLY WILL NOT BE LONG IN HIS POSSESSION YOU CANNOT MEAN THAT YOU WILL BREAK YOUR HEART AND DIE FOR THE DETESTABLE CONDUCT OF AN INFAMOUS VILLAIN LIKE THAT BY NO MEANS
SEPTEMBER 30TH.--OUR GUESTS HAVE BEEN HERE A WEEK OR TWO
I MUST SPEAK RIGHT OUT YOU KNOW OR ELSE NOT AT ALL
MISCONSTRUING THIS HESITATION INTO INDIFFERENCE--OR RELUCTANCE EVEN--TO ACCEPT HER GIFT HELEN SUDDENLY SNATCHED IT FROM MY HAND THREW IT OUT ON TO THE SNOW SHUT DOWN THE WINDOW WITH AN EMPHASIS AND WITHDREW TO THE FIRE
ESPECIALLY AS THERE WAS NO ONE TO REMIND HER OF MY EXISTENCE--NO MEANS OF ASSURING HER OF MY FERVENT CONSTANCY NOW THAT WE WERE SO FAR APART AND DELICACY FORBADE ME TO SEE HER OR TO WRITE TO HER FOR MONTHS TO COME AT LEAST
I KNOW YOU ARE NOT THE HEARTLESS ICY BEING YOU PRETEND TO BE--YOU HAD A HEART ONCE AND GAVE IT TO YOUR HUSBAND
BUT SOMETIMES I BELIEVE SHE REALLY HAD SOME LITTLE GRATIFICATION IN CONVERSING WITH ME
ARTHUR DARLING RUN AND GATHER THOSE BLUEBELLS SAID SHE POINTING TO SOME THAT WERE GLEAMING AT SOME DISTANCE UNDER THE HEDGE ALONG WHICH WE WALKED
THIS MUST BE MY FAULT AS MUCH AS THEIRS THAT WRONG ME
THE FIRST DAY HE HELD HIMSELF ALOOF FROM HER AS FAR AS HE COULD WITHOUT ANY FLAGRANT BREACH OF HOSPITALITY
HOW COULD I BREAK THAT ICY CRUST OF SHY RESERVE
AND BEING TOLD THEY WERE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL I DECLARED MYSELF WILLING TO GO WITH THEM AND OFFERING MY ARM TO ELIZA WHO READILY ACCEPTED IT IN LIEU OF MY BROTHER'S TOLD THE LATTER HE MIGHT GO BACK FOR I WOULD ACCOMPANY THE LADIES
BUT PRAY DON'T TROUBLE YOUR HEAD--OR HIS OR MINE ABOUT THAT
HE WILL GIVE SUCH A VERSION OF THIS STORY AS WILL LEAVE NO DOUBT AT ALL ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO HEAR IT
WE EXPECTED HIM BACK AMONG US THE NEXT DAY
OH IT IS CRUEL TO LEAVE ME SO LONG ALONE
YOU HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL GLASSES SINCE DINNER AND EATEN NEXT TO NOTHING ALL THE DAY
AT ALL EVENTS WHEN YOU WANT MORE YOU WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO GIVE ME AN ACCOUNT OF HOW THAT'S SPENT
DON'T GO JUST YET I REMAINED AWAITING HER FURTHER COMMANDS
BUT I HAVE TAKEN CARE TO DISAPPOINT HIM--NOT THAT I FEAR ANYTHING HE COULD SAY BUT I HAVE TROUBLE ENOUGH WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF HIS INSULTING CONSOLATIONS CONDOLENCES OR WHATEVER ELSE HE MIGHT ATTEMPT
YOU ARE AN ANGEL OF HEAVEN
AND THESE TWO THINGS ARE THE RUIN OF HIM
GOD MIGHT AWAKEN THAT HEART SUPINE AND STUPEFIED WITH SELF-INDULGENCE AND REMOVE THE FILM OF SENSUAL DARKNESS FROM HIS EYES BUT I COULD NOT
HE MUST CONTRIVE TO BEAR WITH ME
AND CERTAINLY MY CONSCIENCE HAS NEVER ACCUSED ME FROM THAT DAY TO THIS OF ANY EVIL DESIGN IN THE MATTER
IS THAT AFFECTIONATE EBULLITION INTENDED FOR MY HAIR OR MYSELF NURSE SAID I LAUGHINGLY TURNING ROUND UPON HER
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN AND HOW YOUR SISTER'S ROOTS HAVE PROSPERED IN MY CHARGE ADDED SHE AS SHE OPENED THE GATE
THE REQUISITE INFORMATION WAS SOON OBTAINED
ALL YOU CAN SAY HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID BY MY OWN HEART AND REFUTED BY MY REASON
WELL I WILL WAIT AWHILE AND SEE IF HE MENTIONS IT I WAITED MOST ANXIOUSLY FROM HOUR TO HOUR
BUT SHE IS EVER STRAINING TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES WITH THAT DESPICABLE PRIDE THAT SHUNS THE SEMBLANCE OF POVERTY AS OF A SHAMEFUL CRIME
AND IF I STILL CONTINUE TO TREAT YOU WITH CIVILITY AS IF YOU WERE A WOMAN WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS OUT OF REGARD FOR YOUR COUSIN MILICENT'S FEELINGS NOT FOR YOURS UPON PERUSING THIS SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP
ALL THE RETURN I ASK IS THAT YOU WILL TAKE CARE OF HIM WHEN I AM GONE AND NOT BY HARSHNESS AND NEGLECT DRIVE HIM BACK TO HIS OLD COURSES I WAS ALMOST SICK WITH PASSION BUT RACHEL WAS NOW AT THE DOOR
THE AIR OF THE TOWN WOULD BE CERTAIN TO DISAGREE WITH HIM AND WITH ME AS A NURSE
HIS NIECE ANNABELLA A FINE DASHING GIRL OR RATHER YOUNG WOMAN,--OF SOME FIVE-AND-TWENTY TOO GREAT A FLIRT TO BE MARRIED ACCORDING TO HER OWN ASSERTION BUT GREATLY ADMIRED BY THE GENTLEMEN WHO UNIVERSALLY PRONOUNCED HER A SPLENDID WOMAN
AND OF ALL HE HAD EVER KNOWN I JUDGING BY THE RESULTS WAS THE COMPANION MOST AGREEABLE TO HIS TASTE
AND IF I COULD LOOK COMPLACENTLY ON IN SUCH A CASE IT WOULD BE ONLY FROM THE ASSURANCE THAT YOU WERE BEING PURIFIED FROM YOUR SINS AND FITTED TO ENJOY THE HAPPINESS I FELT.--BUT ARE YOU DETERMINED ARTHUR THAT I SHALL NOT MEET YOU IN HEAVEN HUMPH
BUT WHAT IF FREDERICK SHOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED MY LETTER
WHETHER I PROPOSED GOING BACK ALONE--WHICH LOWBOROUGH WOULD NOT HEAR OF--OR TAKING HIM WITH ME THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE ITSELF WOULD BE CERTAIN TO EXCITE SUSPICION--AND WHEN OUR VISIT IS SO NEARLY AT AN END TOO--LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK--SURELY YOU CAN ENDURE MY PRESENCE SO LONG
BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT HIS PERTNESS WAS SERIOUSLY DISPLEASING AND PAINFUL TO HIS AUNT HE WENT AND SILENTLY PUT HIS ARM ROUND HER NECK KISSED HER CHEEK AND WITHDREW TO THE RECESS OF ONE OF THE GREAT BAY-WINDOWS WHERE HE QUIETLY AMUSED HIMSELF WITH HIS DOG WHILE MRS MAXWELL GRAVELY DISCUSSED WITH ME THE INTERESTING TOPICS OF THE WEATHER THE SEASON AND THE ROADS
THAT PRETTY CHILD IS NOW A FINE YOUNG MAN
ON TAKING MY SEAT I HAD ROSE ON ONE SIDE OF ME AND AN EMPTY CHAIR ON THE OTHER
SHE TOLD ME HERSELF
BUT I ASKED NO MORE IMPERTINENT QUESTIONS AND MERELY ANSWERED,--'I KNOW IT IS
IT HAS INDEED!--AND BY A SINGLE LADY GOOD GRACIOUS MY DEAR
THIS STARTLED HIM
FOR TO CONFESS THE TRUTH I WAS TOO HAPPY IN THE COMPANY OF MRS GRAHAM TO REGRET THE ABSENCE OF ELIZA MILLWARD
BUT I THINK I MIGHT HAVE INFLUENCE SUFFICIENT TO SAVE HIM FROM SOME ERRORS AND I SHOULD THINK MY LIFE WELL SPENT IN THE EFFORT TO PRESERVE SO NOBLE A NATURE FROM DESTRUCTION
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF HER ARE YOU HELEN HE ASKED WITH A MISCHIEVOUS TWINKLE IN HIS EYES
MY MOTHER AS USUAL WAS CHEERFUL AND CHATTY FULL OF ACTIVITY AND GOOD-NATURE AND ONLY FAULTY IN BEING TOO ANXIOUS TO MAKE HER GUESTS HAPPY THEREBY FORCING SEVERAL OF THEM TO DO WHAT THEIR SOUL ABHORRED IN THE WAY OF EATING OR DRINKING SITTING OPPOSITE THE BLAZING FIRE OR TALKING WHEN THEY WOULD BE SILENT
I WOULD NOT LET HIM GO
IT WAS LIKELY TO BE A LONELY JOURNEY
DO YOU ALWAYS BRUSH YOUR HAT SO CAREFULLY AND DO YOUR HAIR SO NICELY AND PUT ON SUCH SMART NEW GLOVES WHEN YOU TAKE A WALK NOT ALWAYS YOU'RE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL AREN'T YOU WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE--BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO SO OFTEN NONSENSE CHILD
I HEARD IT PLAINLY ENOUGH
MEANTIME MR HATTERSLEY STRODE UP TO THE FIRE AND INTERPOSING HIS HEIGHT AND BREADTH BETWEEN US AND IT STOOD WITH ARMS AKIMBO EXPANDING HIS CHEST AND GAZING ROUND HIM AS IF THE HOUSE AND ALL ITS APPURTENANCES AND CONTENTS WERE HIS OWN UNDISPUTED POSSESSIONS
HE TOOK IT UP AND COOLLY SAT DOWN TO EXAMINE ITS CONTENTS
YOU SAID YOU WOULD GIVE YOUR LIFE TO SERVE ME
HER HAIR WAS RAVEN BLACK AND DISPOSED IN LONG GLOSSY RINGLETS A STYLE OF COIFFURE RATHER UNUSUAL IN THOSE DAYS BUT ALWAYS GRACEFUL AND BECOMING
FOR THOUGH SHE NO LONGER HOPED TO WIN ME TO HERSELF SHE STILL HATED HER RIVAL AND EVIDENTLY DELIGHTED TO WREAK HER SPITE ON ME
THEN FOOTSTEPS WERE HEARD ON THE STAIRS AND MY AUNT ENTERED THE ROOM WITH A SOLEMN COUNTENANCE AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER
I MUST GO WITH YOU OR COME TO YOU
I FOUND ITS OWNER PENSIVELY STROLLING IN THE GROUNDS
YOU MUST NOT STAY LONG GILBERT SAID SHE WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED UPON US
BUT WHEN I HAD ENTERED MY ROOM AND THROWN MYSELF INTO AN EASY-CHAIR TO REFLECT ON THE EVENTS OF THE DAY MY AUNT FOLLOWED ME THITHER AND HAVING DISMISSED RACHEL WHO WAS CAREFULLY STOWING AWAY MY ORNAMENTS CLOSED THE DOOR
MRS GRAHAM SAID I HE CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD AS HE SPOKE THESE ARE TERRIBLE REPORTS WHAT SIR SAYS SHE AFFECTING TO BE IGNORANT OF MY MEANING
BUT TO BE SURE IT WAS RATHER PROVOKING
I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO INTERRUPT HIM
AT ALL EVENTS HE MUST HAVE MET WITH SOME TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AND YOU OUGHT TO SEE HIM
I THANK GOD FOR THIS DELIVERANCE
BUT HIS CONFUSION WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT
SHE EXERTED HERSELF TO BE AGREEABLE IN HER GENTLE UNOBTRUSIVE WAY AND WAS NO DOUBT AS FASCINATING AND CHARMING AS EVER IF I COULD ONLY HAVE FELT IT
IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE--YOU ARE TOO RELIGIOUS
DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH FOR BOTH
HER GENTLENESS CONQUERED
BUT WHATEVER HE SOUGHT IN MY COUNTENANCE HE SAW THERE NOTHING BUT THE MOST BECOMING GRAVITY--IT MIGHT BE MINGLED WITH A LITTLE STERNNESS IN MOMENTARY RESENTMENT AT WHAT I SUSPECTED TO BE PASSING IN HIS MIND
NOT THAT I WISH HIM TO CLOSE HIS ACCOUNTS ADDED HE
BUT WHAT WAS TO BE DONE NOW
BUT WHILE I CONSIDERED IN WHAT MANNER I COULD BEST FRAME MY REQUEST MY COMPANION WAKENED FROM HER REVERIE WITH A SCARCELY AUDIBLE SIGH AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE WINDOW WHERE THE BLOOD-RED HARVEST MOON JUST RISING OVER ONE OF THE GRIM FANTASTIC EVERGREENS WAS SHINING IN UPON US SAID,--'GILBERT IT IS GETTING LATE I SEE SAID I
MR HUNTINGDON I SUPPOSE IS NOT WITHOUT THE COMMON FACULTIES OF MEN
I'M NOT GOING TO DEFILE MY FINGERS WITH HIM SAID I IN ANSWER TO THE MATERNAL INTERCESSION
I ROSE AND WAS ABOUT TO CLAP MY HAT UPON MY HEAD AND BURST AWAY IN WRATHFUL INDIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE
HE POLITELY DECLINED AND PUSHING HIS CHAIR A LITTLE AWAY FROM THE TABLE LEANT BACK TOWARDS ME--I WAS SEATED A TRIFLE BEHIND ON THE SOFA BESIDE ELIZA MILLWARD--AND CARELESSLY ASKED ME IF I KNEW MRS GRAHAM
AND IMMEDIATELY TAKING THE HINT HE GRAVELY BOWED WISHED ME GOOD-EVENING AND TURNED HIS HORSE TOWARDS THE ROAD
HAVING SEEN HIM BEND HIS COURSE TOWARDS THE SHRUBBERY I FOLLOWED HIM THITHER AND FOUND HIM JUST ENTERING THE SHADOWY WALK
OH WHAT DELIGHT IT WAS TO BE THUS SEATED ALOFT RUMBLING ALONG THE BROAD SUNSHINY ROAD WITH THE FRESH MORNING BREEZE IN MY FACE SURROUNDED BY AN UNKNOWN COUNTRY ALL SMILING--CHEERFULLY GLORIOUSLY SMILING IN THE YELLOW LUSTRE OF THOSE EARLY BEAMS
NOT CHOOSING TO SHOW MYSELF UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I STOOD STILL IN THE SHADOW TILL YOU HAD BOTH PASSED BY AND HOW MUCH OF OUR CONVERSATION DID YOU HEAR I HEARD QUITE ENOUGH HELEN
CHAPTER XXVI SEPT
THE OLD TROJAN IS WELCOME TO KEEP HIS BOOKS OPEN AS LONG AS HE PLEASES FOR ME I HOPE SO INDEED MR HATTERSLEY OH YES
WHEN HE IS UNDER THE EXCITING INFLUENCE OF THESE EXCESSES HE SOMETIMES FIRES UP AND ATTEMPTS TO PLAY THE BRUTE
WE BOTH RELAPSED INTO SILENT MUSING AS WE SLOWLY PROCEEDED UP THE WALK
BUT HE IS MY ONLY TREASURE AND I AM HIS ONLY FRIEND
AND IF I SAID SHE AM YOUNG IN YEARS I AM OLD IN SORROW
STOP STOP CRIED HE
AND COME NEARER TO ME HELEN AND TAKE MY ARM
IT RATHER RESEMBLED THE LATTER
I MUST CONTRIVE TO LET HER KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT IF I CAN CONTINUED HE REFLECTIVELY OR SHE WILL BE HEARING SOME SUCH STORY
YES AND THEN HE TOLD ME WHAT CONSIDERATIONS HAD IMPELLED HIM TO MAKE THE VENTURE AND WITH WHAT PRECAUTIONS HE HAD MADE IT
LORD LOWBOROUGH IS A DESPERATE MAN
SHE IS CONTINUALLY TALKING TO ME ABOUT HIM AND LAUDING HIS MANY VIRTUES TO THE SKIES YOU WILL FORM A VERY INADEQUATE ESTIMATE OF A MAN'S CHARACTER REPLIED SHE IF YOU JUDGE BY WHAT A FOND SISTER SAYS OF HIM
AND I DETERMINED TO BEAR THEM WITHOUT A MURMUR
I WISH HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO SOME USEFUL TRADE OR PROFESSION OR EMPLOYMENT--ANYTHING TO OCCUPY HIS HEAD OR HIS HANDS FOR A FEW HOURS A DAY AND GIVE HIM SOMETHING BESIDES HIS OWN PLEASURE TO THINK ABOUT
I NOW FORGAVE HIM FROM MY HEART HIS RECKLESS SLIGHT OF ME AND I FELT ASHAMED AT MY PETTISH RESENTMENT OF SUCH A TRIFLE--ASHAMED TOO OF THOSE BITTER ENVIOUS PANGS THAT GNAWED MY INMOST HEART IN SPITE OF ALL THIS ADMIRATION AND DELIGHT
BUT SHE WAS WITH HER FRIENDS IN THE PONY-CARRIAGE AS HAPPY I TRUSTED AS I WAS
I MARCHED UP TO THE DOOR DETERMINED IF I SAW THE MASTER TO QUESTION HIM BOLDLY CONCERNING HIS SISTER TO WAIT AND HESITATE NO LONGER BUT CAST FALSE DELICACY AND STUPID PRIDE BEHIND MY BACK AND KNOW MY FATE AT ONCE
YOU HAVE BEATEN ME IN THAT GAME WILL YOU TRY ANOTHER THEN NO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE MY SUPERIORITY YES AS A CHESS-PLAYER I ROSE TO RESUME MY WORK
YOU CAN'T TELL TILL YOU HAVE SEEN HIM
LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER I BEHELD A SHADOW JUST RETIRING ROUND THE CORNER
I'LL COME HOME SIGHING LIKE A FURNACE AND FULL OF THE SAVOUR AND UNCTION OF DEAR MR BLATANT'S DISCOURSE MR LEIGHTON SAID I DRYLY
AND WHEN I LOOK INTO THE GLASS I AM STARTLED AT MY HAGGARD WORN APPEARANCE
BUT EITHER HE CONSIDERED HIS HEAD UNFIT FOR A HAT OR THE HAT IN ITS PRESENT CONDITION UNFIT FOR HIS HEAD
HE WAS EVIDENTLY BOTH SURPRISED AND ANNOYED TO FIND HER HERE GO IT CRIED FERGUS WHO SAT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ELIZA AND WAS THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL WHO SHARED THAT SIDE OF THE TABLE WITH US
BUT THERE WAS HER DESK LEFT OPEN ON THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE BESIDE THE HIGH-BACKED CHAIR WITH A BOOK LAID UPON IT
YOU SHALL HAVE A KISS FOR THAT
IT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN INHABITED ABOVE A WEEK!--AND WE NEVER KNEW IMPOSSIBLE CRIED MY MOTHER
HAVING ENDED HIS SCRUTINY HE QUIETLY REMARKED,--'I PERCEIVE THE BACKS OF YOUNG LADIES DRAWINGS LIKE THE POSTSCRIPTS OF THEIR LETTERS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND INTERESTING PART OF THE CONCERN THEN LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR HE REFLECTED A FEW MINUTES IN SILENCE COMPLACENTLY SMILING TO HIMSELF AND WHILE I WAS CONCOCTING SOME CUTTING SPEECH WHEREWITH TO CHECK HIS GRATIFICATION HE ROSE AND PASSING OVER TO WHERE ANNABELLA WILMOT SAT VEHEMENTLY COQUETTING WITH LORD LOWBOROUGH SEATED HIMSELF ON THE SOFA BESIDE HER AND ATTACHED HIMSELF TO HER FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT EVERY TIME WE MEET THE THOUGHTS OF THE FINAL PARTING WILL BECOME MORE PAINFUL
SHE WENT DASHING ON FOR A SEASON BUT YEARS CAME AND MONEY WENT
FOR SUCH FAVOURS IN THEMSELVES ALONE ARE NOT ONLY DELIGHTFUL TO MY HEART BUT PURIFYING EXALTING ENNOBLING TO MY SOUL
IF WE COME HERE A YEAR OR TWO HENCE WE SHALL HAVE ALL OUR OWN WAY YOU'LL SEE I DON'T KNOW REPLIED THE OTHER
JEALOUS
YOU'VE BEEN WEEPING I SEE--THAT'S OUR GRAND RESOURCE YOU KNOW
IS IT NOTHING TO YOU HELEN
LET US THINK OF THAT SAID SHE IN A TONE OF DESPERATE CALMNESS
I ONLY WANTED TO INDULGE MY THOUGHTS UNNOTICED AND UNDISTURBED
BUT I THOUGHT--YES AND THE VOICE CONFIRMED IT--IT WAS MR LAWRENCE
SHE HAD OBSERVED MY PREFERENCE FOR THE YOUNG WIDOW AND EVIDENTLY FELT HERSELF NEGLECTED
AND SEIZING BOTH MY HANDS HE HELD THEM VERY TIGHT BUT DROPPED UPON HIS KNEE AND LOOKED UP IN MY FACE WITH A HALF-IMPLORING HALF-IMPERIOUS GAZE
PERHAPS HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO BE SILENT ON THE SUBJECT FOR FEAR OF RAISING INQUIRIES AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE QUARREL AND DRAWING THE PUBLIC ATTENTION TO HIS CONNECTION WITH MRS GRAHAM WHICH WHETHER FOR HER SAKE OR HIS OWN HE SEEMED SO VERY DESIROUS TO CONCEAL
HE WAS JUST AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR AND HEARING MY STEP IN THE HALL--THOUGH I COULD HARDLY HEAR IT MYSELF--HE INSTANTLY TURNED BACK
I FEAR SHE LEADS HIM A RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE LIFE THOUGH HAPPILY HE IS TOO DULL TO PERCEIVE THE EXTENT OF HIS MISFORTUNE
IF I THOUGHT MYSELF DOOMED TO OLD-MAIDENHOOD I SHOULD CEASE TO VALUE MY LIFE
HE WOULD HAVE DONE SO,--AND PERHAPS SPOILT MY FACE TOO BUT PROVIDENTIALLY THIS FOREST OF CURLS TAKING OFF HIS HAT AND SHOWING HIS LUXURIANT CHESTNUT LOCKS SAVED MY SKULL AND PREVENTED THE GLASS FROM BREAKING TILL IT REACHED THE TABLE AFTER THAT HE CONTINUED LOWBOROUGH KEPT ALOOF FROM US A WEEK OR TWO LONGER
WHY HAVE YOU NO FIRE I SAID LOOKING ROUND ON THE GLOOMY APARTMENT
AND THIS CONSIDERABLY SOFTENED MY RESENTMENT THOUGH IT DID NOT MAKE ME RELENT
THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT BRANWELL'S OPIUM MADNESS HIS BOUTS OF DRUNKENNESS AT THE BLACK BULL HIS VIOLENCE AT HOME HIS FREE AND COARSE TALK AND HIS PERPETUAL BOAST OF GUILTY SECRETS INFLUENCED THE IMAGINATION OF HIS WHOLLY PURE AND INEXPERIENCED SISTERS
AS THOUGH HE WAS MORE ROUGH-HEWN THAN MINE I BELIEVED HE WAS OF A LESS IMPENETRABLE MATERIAL AND SO THAT IS THE WAY YOU GO ON--HEARTENING EACH OTHER UP TO MUTINY AND ABUSING EACH OTHER'S PARTNERS AND THROWING OUT IMPLICATIONS AGAINST YOUR OWN TO THE MUTUAL GRATIFICATION OF BOTH ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN ACCOUNT SAID I MY EVIL COUNSEL HAS HAD BUT LITTLE EFFECT UPON HER
18 1822.--EARLY THIS MORNING ARTHUR MOUNTED HIS HUNTER AND SET OFF IN HIGH GLEE TO MEET THE
BEHIND IT LAY A FEW DESOLATE FIELDS AND THEN THE BROWN HEATH-CLAD SUMMIT OF THE HILL
AND FOR SOME TIME HE CONTINUED TO LOOK IN UPON US PRETTY REGULARLY OF AN EVENING,--STILL ABSTAINING WITH WONDERFUL PERSEVERANCE FROM THE RANK POISON HE HAD SO BRAVELY FORSWORN
AND I WILL KNOW WHAT FOR
BUT WE HAD NOT DONE WITH MRS GRAHAM YET
SHE RETURNED TO THE WRITING OF SHIRLEY
SHE WAS JUST SAYING THIS AS I ENTERED AND SHE DARTED UPON ME SUCH A GLANCE OF HARDIHOOD AND DEFIANCE AS AT ONCE ASTONISHED AND REVOLTED ME
AND I WILL NEVER STAY WITH THEM ONE MOMENT LONGER THAN I THINK RIGHT FOR YOU OR ANY OTHER TEMPTER
BUT I SAW HIM DART TOWARDS HIS LADY AND HIS HOST A QUICK IMPATIENT GLANCE EXPRESSIVE OF INTENSE DISQUIETUDE AT WHICH GRIMSBY SMILED
MY OPINION HAPPILY MET HER APPROBATION AND THE IMPROVEMENT I SUGGESTED WAS ADOPTED WITHOUT HESITATION
AND WHETHER I LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND'S SUFFERINGS OR HER OWN IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE A JUDGMENT UPON MYSELF FOR HAVING CHERISHED SUCH A WISH
MY WIFE SAID HE WITH A START
FOR IF YOU SUFFER OUR PRESENCE TO INTERRUPT YOU WE SHALL BE CONSTRAINED TO REGARD OURSELVES AS UNWELCOME INTRUDERS OH NO REPLIED SHE THROWING HER BRUSH ON TO THE TABLE AS IF STARTLED INTO POLITENESS
I TOOK IT UP
HE HAD NOT THE TASTE TO PREFER ELIZA MILLWARD
PROVIDED YOU NEVER ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE I MAKE NO EMPTY PROMISES BUT YOU SHALL SEE THE MOMENT YOU DO OUR INTIMACY IS AT AN END THAT'S ALL AND WILL YOU ALWAYS CALL ME GILBERT
I FEEL CALMER NOW THAT I HAVE WRITTEN ALL THIS
I SHALL NOT SOON FORGET THE SECOND NIGHT AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL
SO YOU MAY LOOK ON THE MATTER AS SETTLED
WERE TOLD IT WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT PERSEVERED AND IF THEY COMPLAINED OF INCONVENIENT RESULTS THEREFROM WERE ASSURED IT WAS ALL FANCY
HE FERVENTLY EMBRACED ME AND THOUGH I SHED A TORRENT OF TEARS I THINK I NEVER WAS HAPPIER IN MY LIFE THAN AT THAT MOMENT
GOD GRANT ME SUCCESS HERE THE CONVERSATION ENDED FOR AT THIS JUNCTURE MY UNCLE'S VOICE WAS HEARD FROM HIS CHAMBER LOUDLY CALLING UPON MY AUNT TO COME TO BED
BUT NOT ALONE
I OUGHT TO HAVE HELPED HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF--TO HAVE BOUND UP THE WOUND HE WAS UNABLE TO STAUNCH AND INSISTED UPON GETTING HIM ON HIS HORSE AND SEEING HIM SAFE HOME
NEWBY INFORMED THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS WITH WHOM THEY WERE NEGOTIATING THAT IT WAS THE WORK OF THE SAME HAND WHICH HAD PRODUCED JANE EYRE AND SUPERIOR TO EITHER JANE EYRE OR WUTHERING HEIGHTS
NO MATTER
MRS GRAHAM HERSELF WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
PERHAPS HE WOULD THINK ME TOO POOR--TOO LOWLY BORN TO MATCH WITH HIS SISTER
YET WHY SO LONG FOR THEIR DEPARTURE
GEN'LEMAN FOR STANINGLEY HALL CRIED THE COACHMAN AND I ROSE AND THREW MY CARPET-BAG ON TO THE GROUND PREPARATORY TO DROPPING MYSELF DOWN AFTER IT
IF HE IS NOW EXPOSED TO THE BANEFUL INFLUENCE OF CORRUPTING AND WICKED COMPANIONS WHAT GLORY TO DELIVER HIM FROM THEM
DISMISSING RACHEL TO HER REST I WALKED UP AND DOWN MY ROOM IN AN AGONY OF MISERY FOR WHAT HAD BEEN DONE AND SUSPENSE NOT KNOWING WHAT MIGHT FURTHER HAPPEN OR HOW OR WHEN THAT UNHAPPY CREATURE WOULD COME UP TO BED
NO ONE
THEN HE IS REALLY COMING NEXT WEEK SAID I AFTER A PAUSE
AND THEREFORE IF YOU WILL INFORM ME WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD OR IMAGINED AGAINST HER I SHALL PERHAPS BE ABLE TO SET YOU RIGHT CAN YOU TELL ME THEN WHO WAS HER HUSBAND OR IF SHE EVER HAD ANY INDIGNATION KEPT ME SILENT
SOON AFTER TEN O'CLOCK I HEARD HIM COME UP AGAIN BUT HE PASSED MY DOOR AND WENT STRAIGHT TO HIS OWN DRESSING-ROOM WHERE HE SHUT HIMSELF IN FOR THE NIGHT
IT IS THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF YOUR CONDUCT TOWARDS YOUR FRIEND AND IF YOU WISH ME TO FORGET IT GO NOW AND TELL HIM WHAT SORT OF A WOMAN IT IS THAT HE ADORES SO MADLY AND ON WHOM HE HAS HUNG HIS HOPES OF FUTURE HAPPINESS I TELL YOU HELEN IT WOULD BREAK HIS HEART--IT WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM--BESIDES BEING A SCANDALOUS TRICK TO POOR ANNABELLA
I MERELY LEANT MY HAND UPON IT AND BID HIM GO ON
IT IS SOMETHING HOWEVER TO HAVE MADE HIM SEE THAT THEY ARE NOT FIT SUBJECTS FOR A CONJUGAL JEST
I CAN MANAGE TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES WITH HIS DAUGHTERS IF THEY'LL ALLOW ME SAID I BRINGING A CHAIR TO THE FIRE AND SEATING MYSELF THEREIN WITHOUT WAITING TO BE ASKED
ELIZA TOLD ME SHE HAD ONLY COME BECAUSE HER FATHER INSISTED UPON IT HAVING TAKEN IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT SHE DEVOTED HERSELF TOO EXCLUSIVELY TO HER HOUSEHOLD DUTIES TO THE NEGLECT OF SUCH RELAXATIONS AND INNOCENT ENJOYMENTS AS WERE PROPER TO HER AGE AND SEX
PAPA IS QUITE OFFENDED I CAN TELL YOU SHE ADDED PLAYFULLY LOOKING INTO MY FACE WITH AN IMPERTINENT LAUGH AS SHE SEATED HERSELF HALF BESIDE AND HALF BEFORE MY DESK OFF THE CORNER OF THE TABLE
BUT IF THEY TRY TO TEACH BY EXAMPLE THEN ANNE AND EMILY BRONTE ARE READY TO THEIR HAND
GRIMSBY HATTERSLEY HARGRAVE LADY LOWBOROUGH ALL SHARED MY SISTERLY KINDNESS
AND EVEN WHEN SHE ANGERED ME BY HER UNKIND WORDS OR LOOKS AND HER UNCHARITABLE CONCLUSIONS RESPECTING ME IT ONLY MADE ME THE MORE DISSATISFIED WITH MYSELF FOR HAVING SO UNFAVOURABLY IMPRESSED HER AND THE MORE DESIROUS TO VINDICATE MY CHARACTER AND DISPOSITION IN HER EYES AND IF POSSIBLE TO WIN HER ESTEEM
I EXONERATE MY SISTER FROM SUCH DEGRADED TASTES AND MY MOTHER TOO IF YOU INCLUDED HER IN YOUR ANIMADVERSIONS I MEANT NO ANIMADVERSIONS AGAINST ANY ONE AND CERTAINLY INTENDED NO DISRESPECTFUL ALLUSIONS TO YOUR MOTHER
THERE SHALL BE NOTHING SHOT BESIDES EXCEPT A PUSS OR TWO
AND HAPPILY I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT
WE'D BETTER STOP WHILE WE CAN JUST SO CRIED HATTERSLEY STOP POOR SINNER STOP AND THINK BEFORE YOU FURTHER GO NO LONGER SPORT UPON THE BRINK OF EVERLASTING WOE EXACTLY REPLIED HIS LORDSHIP WITH THE UTMOST GRAVITY
AND WE WERE ALL VERY MERRY AND HAPPY TOGETHER--AS FAR AS I COULD SEE--THROUGHOUT THE PROTRACTED SOCIAL MEAL
DID I OR DID I NOT NO MUTTERED HE TURNING AWAY
SO WAS THE ROOM
SHE MENTIONED A COMMON NAME AND AN UNKNOWN AND DISTANT PLACE OF ABODE BUT TOLD ME THEY WERE NOW ON THE CONTINENT AND THEIR PRESENT ADDRESS WAS UNKNOWN TO HER
I HAD NOT WALKED ABOVE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE SHE WAS AT THE DOOR AGAIN
THE HAPPY RED-BREAST WAS POURING OUT ITS LITTLE SOUL IN SONG AND MY HEART OVERFLOWED WITH SILENT HYMNS OF GRATITUDE AND PRAISE TO HEAVEN
SHE HAD OR MIGHT HAVE HAD MANY SUITORS IN HER OWN RANK OF LIFE BUT SCORNFULLY REPULSED OR REJECTED THEM ALL
WE ARE NOW ANXIOUSLY AWAITING HIM
HATTERSLEY LAUGHED AND CLAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER
WHAT HE WOULD BE IF I DID NOT SO WATCHFULLY ANTICIPATE HIS WANTS AND SO CAREFULLY AVOID OR IMMEDIATELY DESIST FROM DOING ANYTHING THAT HAS A TENDENCY TO IRRITATE OR DISTURB HIM WITH HOWEVER LITTLE REASON I CANNOT TELL
COME
COME
COME
AND LET YOUR AFFECTIONS BE CONSEQUENT UPON APPROBATION ALONE
I GRASPED MY WHIP WITH MORE DETERMINED ENERGY THAN BEFORE--BUT STILL FORBORE TO RAISE IT AND RODE ON IN SILENCE WAITING FOR SOME MORE TANGIBLE CAUSE OF OFFENCE BEFORE I OPENED THE FLOODGATES OF MY SOUL AND POURED OUT THE DAMMED-UP FURY THAT WAS FOAMING AND SWELLING WITHIN
TO HAVE SEEN HOW MUCH OF LOVE THERE WAS IN HER REGARD AND HOW IT HAD GROWN UPON HER IN SPITE OF HER VIRTUOUS RESOLUTIONS AND STRENUOUS EXERTIONS TO--BUT NO I HAD NO RIGHT TO SEE IT
MY KIND NEIGHBOURS WILL NOT LET ME ALONE
I FREQUENTLY SAW HIM RIDING LINGERINGLY PAST THE PREMISES LOOKING SEARCHINGLY ROUND HIM AS HE WENT--OR IF I DID NOT RACHEL DID
IF YOU FAVOUR MY CAUSE I AM SAFE
AND HE STOOD LEANING ON THE BACK OF HER CHAIR CONVERSING IN SCARCELY AUDIBLE TONES WITH HIS FACE IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH HERS
BUT WE SHALL NOT BE LONG ALONE TOGETHER
I PROPOSED SEPARATE APARTMENTS
HE'LL TAKE IT VERY UNKIND IF YOU DON'T CONFOUND IT
IF WE CAN ONLY SPEAK TO SLANDER OUR BETTERS LET US HOLD OUR TONGUES I THINK YOU'D BETTER OBSERVED FERGUS AND SO DOES OUR GOOD PARSON
I OWE RACHEL A GRUDGE TO THIS DAY FOR THE LOOK SHE CAST UPON ME ERE SHE DEPARTED ON HER MISSION THE SOUR SUSPICIOUS INQUISITORIAL LOOK THAT PLAINLY DEMANDED WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR I WONDER HER MISTRESS DID NOT FAIL TO NOTICE IT AND A SHADE OF UNEASINESS DARKENED HER BROW
TO NO CONCERNS OF DAILY LIFE COULD I ATTEND WHILE THIS TEMPEST OF DOUBT AND DREAD OF JEALOUSY AND RAGE DISTRACTED ME
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE DON'T MENTION HER--I HAVE NONE
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU WELL
AND NOT YET RETURNED HE SAID SERIOUSLY
I CANNOT ENJOY MY WALKS BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE TO MEET
BUT ON GAINING THE SUMMIT OF A STEEP ACCLIVITY AND LOOKING DOWNWARD AN OPENING LAY BEFORE US--AND THE BLUE SEA BURST UPON OUR SIGHT!--DEEP VIOLET BLUE--NOT DEADLY CALM BUT COVERED WITH GLINTING BREAKERS--DIMINUTIVE WHITE SPECKS TWINKLING ON ITS BOSOM AND SCARCELY TO BE DISTINGUISHED BY THE KEENEST VISION FROM THE LITTLE SEAMEWS THAT SPORTED ABOVE THEIR WHITE WINGS GLITTERING IN THE SUNSHINE
IT IS MINE AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TAKE IT
BUT AT LENGTH I SATISFIED MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT IN VERY DEED IMPRUDENT
FOR DON'T THINK HELEN THAT I'M A TIPPLER
SO YOU WON'T TELL ME?--WELL I'LL SPARE YOUR WOMAN'S PRIDE AND CONSTRUING YOUR SILENCE INTO YES I'LL TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT I WAS THE SUBJECT OF YOUR THOUGHTS AND THE CAUSE OF YOUR AFFLICTION INDEED SIR IF YOU DENY IT I WON'T TELL YOU MY SECRET THREATENED HE
AND I LIKE TO BE QUIET OH
HAD I ANY SUCH DESIRE?--I FEAR I MUST PLEAD GUILTY
AND I TRUST SHE WILL NOT REST TILL SHE HAS ENTIRELY WEANED HER THOUGHTS HE HESITATED
SHORTLY AFTER THE PARTY BROKE UP AND HE HIMSELF TOOK LEAVE
I DO AND WILL LOVE HIM STILL
THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO TURN ROUND AND DESIRE THE MAID TO LIGHT THE FIRE
SO WE PROCEEDED TOGETHER
HOWEVER THOUGHT I I OUGHT NOT TO MARRY ELIZA SINCE MY MOTHER SO STRONGLY OBJECTS TO IT AND I OUGHT NOT TO DELUDE THE GIRL WITH THE IDEA THAT I INTENDED TO DO SO
YES THEY CAN ALL PLAY THE HYPOCRITE WHEN THEY WANT TO TAKE IN A FOND MISGUIDED WOMAN WELL I THINK HE'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS SHE IS SAID I
I FELT MYSELF DRAWN BY AN IRRESISTIBLE ATTRACTION TO THAT DISTANT POINT WHERE THE FAIR ARTIST SAT AND PLIED HER SOLITARY TASK--AND NOT LONG DID I ATTEMPT TO RESIST IT
SO BITTER HE EXCLAIMED LAUGHINGLY CLASPING MY HAND BETWEEN BOTH HIS
I SHOULD WISH YOU TO THINK MORE DEEPLY TO LOOK FURTHER AND AIM HIGHER THAN YOU DO CHAPTER XXIV MARCH 25TH.--ARTHUR IS GETTING TIRED--NOT OF ME I TRUST BUT OF THE IDLE QUIET LIFE HE LEADS--AND NO WONDER FOR HE HAS SO FEW SOURCES OF AMUSEMENT
SOMETHING ROSE WITHIN ME AND URGED ME TO RESENT THIS HARSH RETURN FOR MY HEARTFELT SYMPATHY AND DEFEND MYSELF WITH ANSWERING SEVERITY
THESE THINGS WERE DONE YESTERDAY
WELL THE QUESTION OR QUESTIONS YOU ARE REQUESTED TO SOLVE HOLD YOUR TONGUE FERGUS CRIED ROSE IN A FEVER OF APPREHENSION AND WRATH
COULD YOU NOT LEAVE HIM WITH HER SHE HAS HER OWN OCCUPATIONS TO ATTEND TO
SO LET US--DROP THE SUBJECT I WOULD HAVE SAID FOR IT IS WORSE THAN USELESS TO PURSUE IT ANY FURTHER BUT HE PERTINACIOUSLY INTERRUPTED ME WITH,--'BUT WHY SO
LAST NIGHT AS I SAT BESIDE HIM WITH HIS HEAD IN MY LAP PASSING MY FINGERS THROUGH HIS BEAUTIFUL CURLS THIS THOUGHT MADE MY EYES OVERFLOW WITH SORROWFUL TEARS--AS IT OFTEN DOES
OR IF HE SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TIME TO PREPARE THE ROOMS FOR OUR RECEPTION AND WE SHOULD FIND THEM ALL DARK DAMP AND COMFORTLESS DESTITUTE OF FOOD FIRE AND FURNITURE AFTER ALL OUR TOIL
WITH A SINGLE SET OF QUADRILLES AND SEVERAL COUNTRY DANCES WE CARRIED IT ON TO A PRETTY LATE HOUR
YOU ARE REALLY ILL AND I HAVE MADE YOU WORSE BY ALL THIS TALK OH IT IS NOTHING
YES NO DOUBT HER BROTHER HAD PERSUADED HER THAT I WAS FALSE AND FAITHLESS AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HER NATURAL INDIGNATION AND PERHAPS HER DESPONDING CARELESSNESS ABOUT HER FUTURE LIFE HAD URGED HER ARTFULLY CRUELLY ON TO THIS OTHER MARRIAGE IN ORDER TO SECURE HER FROM ME
WHEN HE HAD DONE THERE WAS AN INTERVAL SPENT IN CLEARING HIS THROAT AND STARING OUT OF THE WINDOW AND THEN AFTER WHISTLING A FEW BARS OF A FAVOURITE AIR HE TURNED ROUND GAVE ME BACK THE LETTERS AND SILENTLY SHOOK ME BY THE HAND
YOU KNOW SHE SLILY SMILED AND SHOOK HER HEAD
DO YOU ADOPT THE SAME RESOLUTION WITH REGARD TO YOURS!--AS FOR YOUR SONS--AS FOR YOU YOUNG MAN HE CONTINUED STERNLY TURNING TO ME AS FOR ME SIR I BEGAN BUT CHECKED BY SOME IMPEDIMENT IN MY UTTERANCE AND FINDING THAT MY WHOLE FRAME TREMBLED WITH FURY I SAID NO MORE BUT TOOK THE WISER PART OF SNATCHING UP MY HAT AND BOLTING FROM THE ROOM SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND ME WITH A BANG THAT SHOOK THE HOUSE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND MADE MY MOTHER SCREAM AND GAVE A MOMENTARY RELIEF TO MY EXCITED FEELINGS
THEY ARE FINE WELL-DISPOSITIONED CHILDREN I KNOW THEY ARE--BLESS THEM THEN WHY LAY THE BLAME ON THEM?--I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS
NO MATTER I ANSWERED THERE ARE MORE CAROLINES IN THE WORLD THAN ONE THERE'S ONLY ONE FOR ME HE REPLIED WITH A DOLOROUS SIGH
RACHEL HAS SOLD MOST OF MY CLOTHES FOR ME IN A DISTANT TOWN AND PROCURED ME A WARDROBE MORE SUITABLE TO MY PRESENT POSITION
AND WE SAUNTERED THROUGH THE GARDEN AND TALKED OF THE FLOWERS THE TREES AND THE BOOK AND THEN OF OTHER THINGS
YOU ARE SQUEEZING YOUR FINGERS INTO THE BONE ARTHUR CONTINUED I RELAXING MY HOLD OF HIS ARM YOU DON'T LOVE ME HALF AS MUCH AS I DO YOU
AND I TURNED AWAY TO ENTER THE DRAWING-ROOM
WHETHER IT BE TRUE OR FALSE EXAGGERATED OR OTHERWISE WE SHALL LIKE TO KNOW HOW HE IS FERGUS MAY GO WHY NOT YOU HE HAS MORE TIME
SO FAR SO GOOD;--BUT HEARING HIM PRONOUNCE SOTTO VOCE BUT WITH PECULIAR EMPHASIS CONCERNING ONE OF THE PIECES THIS IS BETTER THAN ALL!'--I LOOKED UP CURIOUS TO SEE WHICH IT WAS AND TO MY HORROR BEHELD HIM COMPLACENTLY GAZING AT THE BACK OF THE PICTURE:--IT WAS HIS OWN FACE THAT I HAD SKETCHED THERE AND FORGOTTEN TO RUB OUT
WHERE IS HE
AND IN TIME I DID NOT HEAR THE REST OF THE SENTENCE
SO WERE MINE ONCE
FOR BELIEVE ME I REGRET THEM DEEPLY AND THE LOSS OF YOUR ESTEEM IS TOO SEVERE A PENALTY
I WILL NOT CONDESCEND TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO ONE THAT CAN MAKE A JEST OF SUCH HORRIBLE SUSPICIONS AND BE SO EASILY LED TO ENTERTAIN THEM I DO NOT MAKE A JEST OF THEM MRS GRAHAM RETURNED I DROPPING AT ONCE MY TONE OF TAUNTING SARCASM
I HOPED YOU WOULD CALL AGAIN AND NOW I HAVE CALLED AND YOU WERE OUT WHICH YOU GENERALLY ARE OR I WOULD DO MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF CALLING MORE FREQUENTLY
I HAVE DONE ENOUGH FOR HIM AND WILL GLADLY EXERT MYSELF TO GRATIFY YOU AND THUS ENCOURAGED HIS LORDSHIP CAME FORWARD AND TURNING OVER THE MUSIC PRESENTLY SET BEFORE HER A LITTLE SONG THAT I HAD NOTICED BEFORE AND READ MORE THAN ONCE WITH AN INTEREST ARISING FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY CONNECTING IT IN MY MIND WITH THE REIGNING TYRANT OF MY THOUGHTS
AND HE STARTED UP AND LEFT THE ROOM--WALKING RATHER UNSTEADILY FOR THE LIQUOR HAD GOT INTO HIS HEAD
IT WAS MR BOARHAM'S PLAIN DARK CHARIOT
YOU COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME LESS ENCOURAGEMENT OR TREATED ME WITH GREATER SEVERITY THAN YOU DID
WHY CAN'T I HATE HIM
I OFTEN WONDER WHAT WILL BE HER LOT IN LIFE AND SO DOES SHE
YOU NEEDN'T LET THAT DISTRESS YOU I SAID
WHAT I WISH TO SAY IS NOTHING IN ITSELF
I WENT DOWN TO DINNER BUT I COULD NOT FORCE MYSELF TO EAT
HATTERSLEY TRIED CURSING AND SWEARING BUT IT WOULD NOT DO
NOT THAT I HATE HIM
AND HIS MASTER MUTTERED AN OATH
IN THE PARLOUR IT'S COME ROSE PUT AWAY YOUR THINGS AND LET'S HAVE THE ROOM NICE AND TIDY AGAINST THEY COME IN
BUT I DID NOT VISIT IT THAT DAY
IN MY DESPERATION I PUSHED PAST THEM AND WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE CHURCHYARD GATE WHEN A GROUP OF RAGGED URCHINS THAT HAD BEEN HANGING LIKE BEES TO THE WINDOW SUDDENLY DROPPED OFF AND MADE A RUSH FOR THE PORCH VOCIFERATING IN THE UNCOUTH DIALECT OF THEIR COUNTRY SOMETHING WHICH SIGNIFIED IT'S OVER--THEY'RE COMING OUT IF ELIZA MILLWARD HAD SEEN ME THEN SHE MIGHT INDEED HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED
HE DREW MY ARM WITHIN HIS AND LED ME ACROSS THE ROOM TO A SPLENDID PAINTING OF VANDYKE'S THAT I HAD NOTICED BEFORE BUT NOT SUFFICIENTLY EXAMINED
CHAPTER XIX TWENTY SECOND
ALL THE WORLD WILL SAY SHE HAS LEFT HIM AT LAST AND WHO CAN WONDER AT IT
FOR WHEN HE CAME IN AND FOUND ME QUIETLY OCCUPIED WITH MY BOOK TOO BUSY TO LIFT MY HEAD ON HIS ENTRANCE HE MERELY MURMURED AN EXPRESSION OF SUPPRESSED DISAPPROBATION AND SHUTTING THE DOOR WITH A BANG WENT AND STRETCHED HIMSELF AT FULL LENGTH ON THE SOFA AND COMPOSED HIMSELF TO SLEEP
MR HUNTINGDON IS ILL AND SO SHE WENT TO NURSE HIM YES FOOL I COULD NOT HELP EXCLAIMING AND LAWRENCE LOOKED UP WITH A RATHER REPROACHFUL GLANCE
BUT HE SAYS IT IS DULL WORK SHOOTING ALONE
BUT THEN IT IS A BITTER TRIAL TO BEHOLD HIM ON HIS RETURN DOING HIS UTMOST TO SUBVERT MY LABOURS AND TRANSFORM MY INNOCENT AFFECTIONATE TRACTABLE DARLING INTO A SELFISH DISOBEDIENT AND MISCHIEVOUS BOY
WE TOOK A LONG RAMBLE AND RE-ENTERED THE PARK JUST AS THE SPORTSMEN WERE RETURNING FROM THEIR EXPEDITION
THE FALLING OF MY SHADOW ACROSS HER PAPER GAVE HER AN ELECTRIC START
AND THEY CAN'T PUT YOU IN PRISON YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU'RE A PEER AND I HANDED HIM HIS FOURTH TUMBLER
BUT IMMEDIATELY I ADDED IN A QUIETER TONE--'I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU DESIRE
AND I RETURNED HOME ANGRY AND DISSATISFIED--I COULD SCARCELY TELL YOU WHY AND THEREFORE WILL NOT ATTEMPT IT
AND AS I WOULD RATHER GROW LIVE AND DIE IN SINGLE BLESSEDNESS--THAN BE HIS WIFE IT IS BUT RIGHT THAT I SHOULD TELL HIM SO AT ONCE AND PUT HIM OUT OF SUSPENSE--SO LET ME GO BUT DON'T GIVE HIM A FLAT DENIAL
I KNOW IT TOO WELL
COME IT'S TIME TO BE GOING NOW OH NO PAPA PLEADED ELIZA
HE MIGHT MOUNT IT HIMSELF IF HE LIKED--IN A WHILE
AND DO YOU ALWAYS FIND IT TO ANSWER I NEVER CRY FOR EFFECT
BUT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FIELD OR THE GARDEN AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DIFFICULTY
BUT YOU'LL SHAKE HANDS WON'T YOU SAID HE PLACING HIMSELF IN THE DOORWAY BEFORE ME
I CANNOT CALMLY REFLECT UPON IT
BUT I HAD BEEN TOO MUCH ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATING THE DEPLORABLE STATE OF THE OTHER TWO--ESPECIALLY ARTHUR--TO ATTEND TO HIM
NONE I ANSWERED
FOR IT WAS JUST AS I HAD REACHED THAT TREE THAT YOU CAME OUT INTO THE GARDEN WITH YOUR FRIEND
I COULD READILY FORGIVE HER PREJUDICE AGAINST ME AND HER HARD THOUGHTS OF OUR SEX IN GENERAL WHEN I SAW TO WHAT BRILLIANT SPECIMENS HER EXPERIENCE HAD BEEN LIMITED
I WAS EXERTING MYSELF TO SING AND PLAY FOR THE AMUSEMENT AND AT THE REQUEST OF MY AUNT AND MILICENT BEFORE THE GENTLEMEN CAME INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM MISS WILMOT NEVER LIKES TO WASTE HER MUSICAL EFFORTS ON LADIES EARS ALONE MILICENT HAD ASKED FOR A LITTLE SCOTCH SONG AND I WAS JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WHEN THEY ENTERED
HE IS NOW WAITING TO ASK YOU HIMSELF
IF I AM ABLE TO AMUSE I WILL TRY TO BENEFIT TOO
WELL ANNABELLA SAID HER HUSBAND AS HE LEANT OVER THE BACK OF HER CHAIR WHICH OF THESE THREE BOLD MANLY SPIRITS WOULD YOU HAVE ME TO RESEMBLE BY HEAVEN AND EARTH YOU SHALL RESEMBLE US ALL CRIED HATTERSLEY STARTING UP AND RUDELY SEIZING HIM BY THE ARM
ESTHER IS FULL OF HER FIRST SEASON IN TOWN
THEY'RE THE VERY BANE OF THE WORLD
A CONFUSION OF COUNTLESS THOUGHTS AND VARIED EMOTIONS CROWDED UPON ME WHILE I GAZED ABSTRACTEDLY ON THE LOVELY FACE OF NATURE
AGAIN I PROPOSED A SEPARATION BUT IT WOULD NOT DO
BUT NO
BUT NO
THERE STOOD A TRAIN OF CARRIAGES BEFORE IT
I THOUGHT HE LOOKED UNNECESSARILY CONFUSED AT BEING SO APPEALED TO
I HATE A MAN TO BE RED AND WHITE LIKE A PAINTED DOLL OR ALL SICKLY WHITE OR SMOKY BLACK OR CADAVEROUS YELLOW WELL TASTES DIFFER--BUT I LIKE PALE OR DARK REPLIED SHE
I AM WAITING ANXIOUSLY FOR YOUR ADVICE--BUT MIND YOU LET IT BE ALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE ALAS
BUT I WILL DO IT IN GOOD EARNEST IF THEY DON'T MIND BE QUIET AND PATIENT A WHILE SAID I AND BETTER TIMES WILL COME POOR GIRL
MRS GRAHAM SEATED HERSELF AT A DISTANCE FROM ME
MAKE YOUR STORY A SHORT ONE SAID HE PUTTING HIS HAND ON THE SMALL SILVER BELL THAT STOOD ON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM OR I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO CALL FOR ASSISTANCE
PERHAPS I TOOK A PARTICULAR FANCY FOR THIS ROMANTIC OLD-FASHIONED PLACE--BUT INDEED IT HAS MANY ADVANTAGES OVER A COTTAGE--IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU SEE THE ROOMS ARE LARGER AND MORE AIRY
I WAS JUST COMING TO SEE YOUR SISTER MR MARKHAM SAID SHE
WHAT A SWEET EVENING THIS IS OBSERVED HE LOOKING ROUND UPON THE SUNNY PARK WITH ITS IMPOSING SWELL AND SLOPE ITS PLACID WATER AND MAJESTIC CLUMPS OF TREES
I DID NOT CHOOSE TO WITHDRAW MY GAZE AND SHE TURNED AGAIN TO HER BOOK BUT WITH A MOMENTARY INDEFINABLE EXPRESSION OF QUIET SCORN THAT WAS INEXPRESSIBLY PROVOKING TO ME
BUT GILBERT HOW CAN YOU BE SO COMPOSED ABOUT IT
HE WOULDN'T BE SO READY WITH HIS ADVICE TO OTHER PEOPLE THEN;--HE'D SEE WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A COUPLE OF BOYS TO KEEP IN ORDER HE HAD A LAUDABLE CARE FOR HIS OWN BODILY HEALTH--KEPT VERY EARLY HOURS REGULARLY TOOK A WALK BEFORE BREAKFAST WAS VASTLY PARTICULAR ABOUT WARM AND DRY CLOTHING HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO PREACH A SERMON WITHOUT PREVIOUSLY SWALLOWING A RAW EGG--ALBEIT HE WAS GIFTED WITH GOOD LUNGS AND A POWERFUL VOICE,--AND WAS GENERALLY EXTREMELY PARTICULAR ABOUT WHAT HE ATE AND DRANK THOUGH BY NO MEANS ABSTEMIOUS AND HAVING A MODE OF DIETARY PECULIAR TO HIMSELF,--BEING A GREAT DESPISER OF TEA AND SUCH SLOPS AND A PATRON OF MALT LIQUORS BACON AND EGGS HAM HUNG BEEF AND OTHER STRONG MEATS WHICH AGREED WELL ENOUGH WITH HIS DIGESTIVE ORGANS AND THEREFORE WERE MAINTAINED BY HIM TO BE GOOD AND WHOLESOME FOR EVERYBODY AND CONFIDENTLY RECOMMENDED TO THE MOST DELICATE CONVALESCENTS OR DYSPEPTICS WHO IF THEY FAILED TO DERIVE THE PROMISED BENEFIT FROM HIS PRESCRIPTIONS
ME SHE MIGHT FORSAKE BUT NOT TO GIVE HERSELF TO HIM
I TURNED MY BEST SIDE OUT OF COURSE AND WE GOT ALONG MARVELLOUSLY WELL TOGETHER
I HAD STILL MY DOUBTS ON THE SUBJECT
WHAT SORT OF A PERSON IS MISS WILSON SHE ASKED
WHAT ARE THEIR THOUGHTS TO YOU OR ME SO LONG AS WE ARE SATISFIED WITH OURSELVES--AND EACH OTHER
BUT I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD TAKE HIM
BUT A TINY VOICE FROM WITHIN IT ROUSED ME BY EXCLAIMING MAMMA MAMMA HERE'S MR MARKHAM I DID NOT HEAR THE REPLY BUT PRESENTLY THE SAME VOICE ANSWERED IT IS INDEED MAMMA--LOOK FOR YOURSELF I DID NOT RAISE MY EYES BUT I SUPPOSE MAMMA LOOKED FOR A CLEAR MELODIOUS VOICE WHOSE TONES THRILLED THROUGH MY NERVES EXCLAIMED OH AUNT
DO LET ME HAVE QUIETNESS AT LEAST CONTINUED HE IF YOU DENY ME EVERY OTHER COMFORT AND SINKING BACK INTO HIS FORMER POSITION WITH AN IMPATIENT EXPIRATION BETWEEN A SIGH AND A GROAN HE LANGUIDLY CLOSED HIS EYES AS IF TO SLEEP
FOR GOD'S SAKE GO AND SEND ME SOMEBODY ELSE THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT I WENT AT ONCE AND SENT THE HIRED NURSE
BUT HE WAS MORE MERCIFUL
YOU HAVE NOT INJURED ME NO DARLING--GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD
YOU ARE NOT USED TO THESE THINGS
YES BUT WHEN I ASSURED YOU IT WAS NO TROUBLE AND WENT ON WITH THE NEXT VERSE THINKING YOU MIGHT LIKE IT BETTER YOU CLUTCHED ME BY THE SHOULDER AND DASHED ME AWAY RIGHT AGAINST THE WALL THERE WITH SUCH FORCE THAT I THOUGHT I HAD BITTEN MY TONGUE IN TWO AND EXPECTED TO SEE THE PLACE PLASTERED WITH MY BRAINS
AND HE ALWAYS DID HIS--BLESS HIM!--HE WAS STEADY AND PUNCTUAL SELDOM FOUND FAULT WITHOUT A REASON ALWAYS DID JUSTICE TO MY GOOD DINNERS AND HARDLY EVER SPOILED MY COOKERY BY DELAY--AND THAT'S AS MUCH AS ANY WOMAN CAN EXPECT OF ANY MAN IS IT SO HALFORD
YOU MUST AND SHALL TELL ME WAS ADDED MORE VEHEMENTLY AND THE SPEAKER THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BESIDE ME ON THE RUG AND FORCIBLY POSSESSED HIMSELF OF MY HAND
IT LOOKS SO SILLY TO BE ALWAYS DANGLING AFTER THE WOMEN
BUT SAID WE MUST SOON RETURN TO THE HOUSE
AND ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED SHE MUST HAVE MANAGED IT SO ON PURPOSE HAD NIGHTLY KEPT REVOLVING IN MY MIND SOME PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER CALL
THE OLD HALL WHERE HE AND I WERE BORN AND WHERE OUR MOTHER DIED IS NOT NOW INHABITED NOR YET QUITE SUNK INTO DECAY AS I BELIEVE
REMEMBER WE ARE NOT AT HOME NO MATTER
IF YOU WAIT A MINUTE HE WILL BE SURE TO COME
AND NOTHING SHORT OF BODILY ILL-USAGE AND THAT OF NO TRIFLING NATURE COULD EXCUSE SUCH A STEP--NOR EVEN THAT FOR IN SUCH A CASE SHE OUGHT TO APPEAL TO THE LAWS FOR PROTECTION
PICTURE
PICTURE
PICTURE
PICTURE
PICTURE
PICTURE
AND YOU WILL NOT PRETEND THAT YOU LOVED THAT SENSUAL EARTHLY-MINDED PROFLIGATE SO DEEPLY SO DEVOTEDLY THAT YOU CAN NEVER LOVE ANOTHER
AND I DO NOT AND WILL NOT REGRET THAT I HAVE LINKED MY FATE WITH HIS
I'VE GOT IT ALL READY THOUGH YOU DON'T DESERVE IT FOR KEEPING ME IN SUCH A FRIGHT AFTER THE STRANGE MANNER YOU LEFT THE HOUSE THIS EVENING
IT WAS DOUBTLESS OF HIS LOVE FOR HER THEY SPOKE NOT FOR ME
HALLO
AND PLACING A CHAIR BESIDE ME OR RATHER AT RIGHT ANGLES WITH MINE SAT DOWN
AND IS THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED WITH THEM WITHOUT HAVING SUFFERED FROM THEIR EFFECTS AND IS THAT RIGHT SIR
HE WISHES TO READ BY NO MEANS MRS GRAHAM
THAT SEEMS COMFORTABLE CONTINUED HE WITHOUT NOTICING MY WORDS
WHAT CAN I DO REPLIED HE
ONE WORD MORE AND I HAVE DONE
I AM AS MUCH AMUSED AS HE IS PLEADED I
ONLY I'VE DONE MY DUTY--THAT'S ALL IT'S EASILY DONE REPLIED HE WITH A FAINT SMILE BORDERING ON A SNEER
HE THOUGHT I SUPPOSE IT WOULD DO ME GOOD
BUT I FEAR HE IS LOSING THE LITTLE SELF-COMMAND AND SELF-RESPECT HE ONCE POSSESSED
I HOPED SHE WOULD RETURN TO HER DUTY AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO HARROW YOUR FEELINGS WITH SUCH O GOD
WHATEVER NEW BEAUTIES IN NATURE OR ART I DISCOVER ARE TO BE DEPICTED TO MEET HIS EYE OR STORED IN MY MEMORY TO BE TOLD HIM AT SOME FUTURE PERIOD
SHORTLY AFTER I HEARD HIM RING THE BELL AND GIVE SOME ORDERS ABOUT HIS WARDROBE THAT SOUNDED AS IF HE MEDITATED A LONG JOURNEY
HE THOUGHT HIS TRIUMPH WAS AT HAND
BUT HOWEVER IT IS EVIDENT SHE HAS NO LOVE FOR HIM POOR FELLOW THEN YOU OUGHT TO TELL HIM SO WHAT
IT SEEMS MR HUNTINGDON IS MAKING EVERY EXERTION TO DISCOVER THE PLACE OF MY RETREAT
BUT THE VICES OF THE BROTHER REAL OR IMAGINARY HAVE A CERTAIN IMPORTANCE IN LITERATURE BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT THEY PRODUCED UPON HIS SISTERS
BUT NEVER ONCE SINCE ANNABELLA OFFENDED HIM SO DEEPLY HAS HE ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM BEFORE THE REST
BUT HIS IMPERTINENCE AND FOLLY SERVED TO MAKE OTHERS LAUGH IF THEY DID NOT RAISE HIMSELF IN THEIR ESTIMATION
HE MADE A LARGE STAKE WHICH HE DETERMINED SHOULD BE THE LAST WHETHER HE LOST OR WON
WHATEVER AFFLICTIONS ASSAIL ME HERE I CANNOT WISH TO GO AND LEAVE MY DARLING IN THIS DARK AND WICKED WORLD ALONE WITHOUT A FRIEND TO GUIDE HIM THROUGH ITS WEARY MAZES TO WARN HIM OF ITS THOUSAND SNARES AND GUARD HIM FROM THE PERILS THAT BESET HIM ON EVERY HAND
SHE CARED FOR HER FATHER
OH NO MA'AM SHE ANSWERED
BUT TO RETURN
YOU MAY HAVE MINE IF YOU LIKE AND I CALL THAT HANDSOME
BUT HIS GRATEFUL AFFECTION AND YOUR OWN GOOD FEELINGS MUST REWARD YOU FOR THAT NONSENSE EJACULATED I
IT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY HE SAID AND I WAS UNREASONABLE TO WISH IT
AS FOR WHAT HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO SAY HEREAFTER I WOULD TAKE MY CHANCE ABOUT IT
DON'T ATTEMPT TO DISSUADE ME FOR MY FATE IS FIXED
I PERCEIVE CUPID'S ARROWS HAVE BEEN TOO SHARP FOR YOU
IT IS A CREATURE OF MY OWN IMAGINATION
I WAS INFATUATED ONCE WITH A FOOLISH BESOTTED AFFECTION THAT CLUNG TO HIM IN SPITE OF HIS UNWORTHINESS BUT IT IS FAIRLY GONE NOW--WHOLLY CRUSHED AND WITHERED AWAY
THE CARRIAGE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY AND I LOOKED UP AND MET THE EYE OF A PALE GRAVE ELDERLY LADY SURVEYING ME FROM THE OPEN WINDOW
SHE HAS NO SECURITY NO CONFIDENCE IN YOUR JUDGMENT OR PRINCIPLES
STAND OFF THEN SAID I
FOR I COULD NOT LIKE HIM IF HE WERE EVER SO HANDSOME AND EVER SO CHARMING IN OTHER RESPECTS
I SANK INTO THE EASY-CHAIR AND ENDEAVOURED TO COMPOSE MYSELF FOR I WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM CALMLY
THIS TIME HE DID NOT TROUBLE HIMSELF TO MAKE EXCUSES AS BEFORE AND HIS LETTERS WERE LESS FREQUENT AND SHORTER AND LESS AFFECTIONATE ESPECIALLY AFTER THE FIRST FEW WEEKS
SHE HAD NOT
SHALL I MRS HUNTINGDON
AND EVEN WHEN WE PEDESTRIANS HAVING FORSAKEN THE HIGHWAY FOR A SHORT CUT ACROSS THE FIELDS BEHELD THE LITTLE CARRIAGE FAR AWAY DISAPPEARING AMID THE GREEN EMBOWERING TREES I DID NOT HATE THOSE TREES FOR SNATCHING THE DEAR LITTLE BONNET AND SHAWL FROM MY SIGHT NOR DID I FEEL THAT ALL THOSE INTERVENING OBJECTS LAY BETWEEN MY HAPPINESS AND ME
HOW MUCH OF MY HIGHER AND BETTER SELF IS INDEED UNMARRIED--DOOMED EITHER TO HARDEN AND SOUR IN THE SUNLESS SHADE OF SOLITUDE OR TO QUITE DEGENERATE AND FALL AWAY FOR LACK OF NUTRIMENT IN THIS UNWHOLESOME SOIL
SHE ONLY ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS CONCERNING YOU AND SEEMED SATISFIED WITH MY BRIEF ANSWERS WHEREIN SHE SHOWED HERSELF WISER THAN HER FRIEND
BUT FINDING THIS OF NO AVAIL APPARENTLY MADE UP HIS MIND LIKE MAHOMET TO GO TO THE MOUNTAIN SINCE THE MOUNTAIN WOULD NOT COME TO HIM AND ATTEMPTED TO GET OVER
NOW POSITIVE RUDENESS COULD NOT DRIVE HIM AWAY
WAS MR HUNTINGDON PROPOSING TO YOU HELEN INQUIRED MY TOO WATCHFUL RELATIVE
BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE EXPLANATION WE DREW UP AT THE PARK-GATES
BAD LANGUAGE SELDOM DEFILES HIS MOUTH AND I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN GIVING HIM AN ABSOLUTE DISGUST FOR ALL INTOXICATING LIQUORS WHICH I HOPE NOT EVEN HIS FATHER OR HIS FATHER'S FRIENDS WILL BE ABLE TO OVERCOME
DID SHE TELL YOU THAT THAT WAS HER INTENTION NO
IT IS A SERIOUS THING I SHOULD BE PROUD TO DO IT HELEN!--MOST HAPPY--DELIGHTED BEYOND EXPRESSION!--AND IF THAT BE ALL THE OBSTACLE TO OUR UNION IT IS DEMOLISHED AND YOU MUST--YOU SHALL BE MINE AND STARTING FROM MY SEAT IN A FRENZY OF ARDOUR I SEIZED HER HAND AND WOULD HAVE PRESSED IT TO MY LIPS BUT SHE AS SUDDENLY CAUGHT IT AWAY EXCLAIMING IN THE BITTERNESS OF INTENSE AFFLICTION,--'NO NO IT IS NOT ALL WHAT IS IT THEN
SHE COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO THINK THERE WAS DANGER FOR HERSELF OR HER CHILD IN TRAVERSING THOSE LONELY LANES AND FIELDS WITHOUT ATTENDANCE
AND WHAT A FINE SPIRIT OF HER OWN
RACHEL URGED ME TO SEEK REPOSE AT ONCE TO RECRUIT MY STRENGTH FOR TO-MORROW'S JOURNEY AS WE MUST BE GONE BEFORE THE DAWN
AT THE SAME TIME I RESOLVED NOT TO GIVE MYSELF UP TO MISERY FOR THE TRANSGRESSIONS OF ANOTHER AND ENDEAVOURED TO DIVERT MYSELF AS MUCH AS I COULD
AND HAVING SURVEYED IT FOR A MOMENT OPPOSITE THE CANDLE HE TOOK A DEEP DRAUGHT AND THEN SMACKED HIS LIPS DREW A LONG BREATH AND REFILLED HIS GLASS MY MOTHER LOOKING ON WITH THE GREATEST SATISFACTION
AND HE SEIZED MY HAND AND HELD IT MUCH AGAINST MY WILL
YOU SEE I HAVE MADE HER BLUE-EYED AND PLUMP AND FAIR AND ROSY UPON MY WORD--A VERY HEBE
IF YOU HAD NOT SEEN ME HE MUTTERED FIXING HIS EYES ON THE CARPET IT WOULD HAVE DONE NO HARM MY HEART FELT READY TO BURST
THE FACT IS I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE MRS GRAHAM'S BROTHER AND I SAW AND HEARD SOME THINGS RESPECTING YOUR CONDUCT TOWARDS HER WHICH WERE CALCULATED TO AWAKEN UNPLEASANT SUSPICIONS THAT ALLOW ME TO SAY A LITTLE CANDOUR AND CONFIDENCE ON YOUR PART MIGHT HAVE REMOVED
AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO CALL HIM A PROFLIGATE AUNT
AND I HOPE YOU WILL MAKE A VERY GOOD WIFE TO MR HUNTINGDON SAID SHE WITH A QUEENLY BOW AND RETIRED
WHAT MAKES YOU DREAM OF SUCH A THING FROM THE INTEREST YOU TAKE IN THE PROGRESS OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE LADY AND THE CHANGES OF MY OPINION CONCERNING HER I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE JEALOUS HE LAUGHED AGAIN
IT WILL BE MUCH IF THEY JOIN US AT TEA
HE ADDS THIS PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE RESPECTING POOR MILICENT HARGRAVE
I DARESAY THEY HAVE SOME IN THE PUBLIC-HOUSE DOWN THERE IF YOU'LL LET ME RUN HAVE DONE WITH THIS NONSENSE CRIED I STERNLY
SHE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN SCHOOLED INTO BETTER MANNERS
I COULD SWEAR AT THIS MOMENT THAT SHE WAS BY MY SIDE SHE IS SAID I
SHE HAD TAKEN THE POLISH WELL ACQUIRED CONSIDERABLE ELEGANCE OF MANNERS QUITE LOST HER PROVINCIAL ACCENT AND COULD BOAST OF MORE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAN THE VICAR'S DAUGHTERS
SHE DID TELL ME THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN BUT I'VE FORGOTTEN THAT
WHERE I HAVE BUT SIPPED AND TASTED HE DRAINS THE CUP TO THE DREGS
MY IGNORANCE WILL NOT BE CHARGED ON YOU BE IT SO
MY WORST FEARS ARE REALISED
THIS AT LEAST IS THE HOPE THAT I CHERISH THE FANCY THAT LIGHTS ME ON MY LONELY WAY
I SAW THAT PARAGON OF MANLY PERFECTIONS IN LONDON
SHORT OF RENOUNCING YOUR GUILTY CONNECTION WITH MY HUSBAND I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN SAID I
I HAVE A CONFUSED REMEMBRANCE OF SEEING LITTLE ARTHUR RUNNING UP THE GARDEN-WALK TO MEET ME AND OF BOLTING OVER THE WALL TO AVOID HIM--AND SUBSEQUENTLY RUNNING DOWN THE STEEP FIELDS CLEARING THE STONE FENCES AND HEDGES AS THEY CAME IN MY WAY TILL I GOT COMPLETELY OUT OF SIGHT OF THE OLD HALL AND DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL
IT WOULD EASE YOUR MIND
IT IS NOW FOUR DAYS SINCE THE TERMINATION OF OUR QUARREL AND I AM SURE IT HAS DONE US BOTH GOOD
ALMOST AT THE MOMENT OF MY APPROACH HE CAST A HURRIED GLANCE OVER HIS SHOULDER TOWARDS THE OTHER OCCUPANTS OF THE ROOM AND THEN ARDENTLY PRESSED THE UNRESISTING HAND TO HIS LIPS
AND NEXT TO THAT GOOD SENSE RESPECTABILITY AND MODERATE WEALTH
AND NOW WITH MY NERVES ALREADY EXCITED AND HALF UNSTRUNG I COULD NOT HEAR THOSE WORDS SO SWEETLY WARBLED FORTH WITHOUT SOME SYMPTOMS OF EMOTION I WAS NOT ABLE TO SUPPRESS
I HAVE DEVISED ANOTHER SCHEME THAT MIGHT BE RESORTED TO IN SUCH A CASE
I MET HER IN HER WALKS AS OFTEN AS I COULD
I SHOULD BE ASHAMED FOR ANYONE TO SEE YOU IN YOUR PRESENT STATE OF COURSE SUCH A REMARK HAD NO EFFECT IN REDUCING THE SHOCKING COLOUR
BUT STILL LET NOT THE PUREST IMPULSE OF GRATITUDE TO HIM INDUCE ME TO FORGET MYSELF
DO YOU NOT SEE HOW POINTEDLY KIND AND AFFECTIONATE SHE IS
REALLY MR MARKHAM THIS IS TOO MUCH SAID THE LATTER
YOUR OWN SELF-ACCUSATIONS I BELIEVED TO BE OVERSTRAINED
I KNOW TOO WELL THE FEELINGS WITH WHICH THE BEARERS OF BAD TIDINGS ARE COMMONLY REGARDED NOT TO WHAT IS THIS WONDERFUL PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE SAID I IMPATIENTLY INTERRUPTING HIM
BUT I GAVE ONE LOOK BACK BEFORE I CLOSED THE DOOR AND SAW HER LEANING FORWARD ON THE TABLE WITH HER HANDS PRESSED AGAINST HER EYES SOBBING CONVULSIVELY
AND ABOVE ALL OF HER COOL CAUTIOUS AUNT WHOSE COUNSELS SHE WOULD DOUBTLESS BE CAREFUL NOT TO SLIGHT AGAIN
IT SEEMED HARD TO LEAVE HER TO SUCH A LONELY COMFORTLESS HOME
FOR IF MINE IS ALTOGETHER WRONG IT IS NOT HE THAT I LOVE
HER SISTER TREMBLES FOR HER TOO
I WAS ASTOUNDED PROVOKED ASHAMED--NOT SO MUCH OF MY HARSHNESS AS FOR HER CHILDISH WEAKNESS
BUT I NEVER WAVER IN MY RESOLUTION BECAUSE I NEVER FORGET MY SON
HE CANNOT ENDURE RACHEL BECAUSE HE KNOWS SHE HAS A PROPER APPRECIATION OF HIM
ALL THE SERVANTS WERE BUT TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR MASTER'S CONDUCT AND EITHER BENSON OR JOHN WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO SERVE ME
AND STEPPING PAST THE ASTONISHED FOOTMAN I BOLDLY RAPPED AT THE DOOR ENTERED AND CLOSED IT BEHIND ME
CHAPTER XXXI MARCH 20TH 1824
SO SHE HAS BROUGHT ME HOME TO SCHOOL ME INTO A PROPER SENSE OF MY DUTY AGAINST THE TIME COMES ROUND AGAIN
SHE LEANT AGAINST ONE END OF THE CHIMNEY-PIECE OPPOSITE THAT NEAR WHICH I WAS STANDING WITH HER CHIN RESTING ON HER CLOSED HAND HER EYES--NO LONGER BURNING WITH ANGER BUT GLEAMING WITH RESTLESS EXCITEMENT--SOMETIMES GLANCING AT ME WHILE I SPOKE THEN COURSING THE OPPOSITE WALL OR FIXED UPON THE CARPET
SHE HAS POSSIBLY TAKEN A PREJUDICE AGAINST YOU FOR I THINK SHE REGARDS YOU IN THE LIGHT OF A RIVAL ME
I DO OBJECT SOMETIMES AND TELL HER WHAT I FEEL BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW SHE TALKS
AT GRASSDALE MANOR HOW WAS IT I GASPED
WELL NOW SHE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE YOU HAVE MADE YOURSELF CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH FOR ONE EVENING
MR LAWRENCE WAS STANDING BY AT THE TIME CONVERSING WITH SOME ONE ELSE
AND ONE BRIGHT FEBRUARY MORNING DURING TWENTY MINUTES STROLL ALONG THE MOOR SHE LAID ASIDE HER USUAL ASPERITY AND RESERVE AND FAIRLY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH ME DISCOURSING WITH SO MUCH ELOQUENCE AND DEPTH OF THOUGHT AND FEELING ON A SUBJECT HAPPILY COINCIDING WITH MY OWN IDEAS AND LOOKING SO BEAUTIFUL WITHAL THAT I WENT HOME ENCHANTED
THEN SUDDENLY RAISING HER HEAD AND FIXING HER GLEAMING EYES UPON ME SHE CONTINUED EARNESTLY
HOW DRY AND BURNING YOUR HAND IS LAWRENCE SAID I
YOU SHOULD TRY TO SUPPRESS SUCH FOOLISH FONDNESS AS WELL TO SAVE YOUR SON FROM RUIN AS YOURSELF FROM RIDICULE RUIN
HOW MANY LADIES ARE THERE BESIDES TO TAKE CARE OF HIM NONE
IT WOULD DRIVE ME MAD
MOST OF THE COMPANY WERE KILLING TIME IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM BUT MILICENT AND I WERE WITH LITTLE ARTHUR AND HELEN IN THE LIBRARY AND BETWEEN OUR BOOKS OUR CHILDREN AND EACH OTHER WE EXPECTED TO MAKE OUT A VERY AGREEABLE MORNING
AND IF SO I CAN BEAR IT WELL--AS WELL AT LEAST AS I HAVE BORNE IT HITHERTO
AND THEN MIGHT FOLLOW A TRAIN OF OTHER WONDERMENTS--QUESTIONS FOR TIME AND FATE TO ANSWER--CONCLUDING WITH--SUPPOSING ALL THE REST BE ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE I WONDER WHETHER I SHALL EVER REPENT IT
BUT I WAS OUT OF TEMPER WITH ELIZA AT THAT MOMENT FOR HER INSINUATIONS AGAINST MRS GRAHAM WHICH WERE FALSE I WAS CERTAIN WHETHER SHE KNEW IT OR NOT
HE MUST ENTER CRIED ARTHUR RUNNING ROUND FROM THE OTHER DOOR
FOR LOOKING BACK A MINUTE AFTER I SAW HER TURN HALF ROUND AS IF HOPING OR EXPECTING TO FIND ME STILL BESIDE HER
LOST TO ME SHE WAS FOR EVER OF COURSE
WHEN IT WAS ENDED AND MY TRANSIENT REGRET AT ITS ABRUPT CONCLUSION WAS OVER I OPENED THE WINDOW AND PUT OUT MY HEAD TO CATCH THE COOLING BREEZE AND IMBIBE DEEP DRAUGHTS OF THE PURE MORNING AIR
5TH
FOR THOUGH I HAD TOO GOOD REASON NOW TO CREDIT THEIR REPORTS CONCERNING MRS GRAHAM I DID NOT LIKE THEM A BIT THE BETTER FOR IT--OR ELIZA MILLWARD EITHER--AND THE THOUGHT OF MEETING THEM WAS THE MORE REPUGNANT TO ME THAT I COULD NOT NOW DEFY THEIR SEEMING CALUMNIES AND TRIUMPH IN MY OWN CONVICTIONS AS BEFORE
SO TELL ME HELEN YOU'RE EXCESSIVELY IMPERTINENT MR HUNTINGDON NOT AT ALL--TOO PERTINENT YOU MEAN
AND MIND YOU BRING ME WORD HOW MUCH SUGAR SHE PUTS IN HER TEA AND WHAT SORT OF CAPS AND APRONS SHE WEARS AND ALL ABOUT IT
HE HATH MADE MY CHAIN HEAVY
SOMEBODY SAID YOU HAD BEEN STRANGELY NEGLECTING YOUR BUSINESS THESE LAST FEW MONTHS SOMEBODY SAID WRONG FOR THESE LAST TWO MONTHS ESPECIALLY I HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY PLODDING AND DILIGENT AH
AND IF I WERE LIKE ANNABELLA AND SOME OTHERS I SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR PERSEVERANCE TO ENDEAVOUR TO PIQUE HIM INTO A REVIVAL OF AFFECTION
I LIKE COMPANY WHEN I'M WALKING OUT--DON'T YOU YES WHEN IT'S AGREEABLE THAT OF COURSE REJOINED THE YOUNG LADY SMILING ARCHLY
NOT I INDEED WAS THE PHLEGMATIC REPLY
I'VE BEEN A CURSED RASCAL GOD KNOWS SAID HE AS HE GAVE IT A HEARTY SQUEEZE BUT YOU SEE IF I DON'T MAKE AMENDS FOR IT--D--N ME IF I DON'T DON'T CURSE YOURSELF MR HATTERSLEY
AND DO YOU IMAGINE YOUR MERRY THOUGHTLESS PROFLIGATE WOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE GUIDED BY A YOUNG GIRL LIKE YOU NO
BUT IF I COULD SAVE HER IF SHE MIGHT BE MINE!--IT WAS TOO RAPTUROUS A THOUGHT
AND SHE'S THINKING HOW PLEASANT IT WILL BE AND HOW TENDER AND FAITHFUL HE WILL FIND HER AND PERHAPS SUGGESTED I HOW TENDER AND FAITHFUL SHE SHALL FIND HIM PERHAPS FOR THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE WILD EXTRAVAGANCE OF HOPE'S IMAGININGS AT SUCH AN AGE DO YOU CALL THAT THEN ONE OF HER WILD EXTRAVAGANT DELUSIONS NO
THE FORMER WAS THE WIDOW OF A SUBSTANTIAL FARMER A NARROW-MINDED TATTLING OLD GOSSIP WHOSE CHARACTER IS NOT WORTH DESCRIBING
WELL MA'AM I DON'T KNOW
THE SPELL WAS BROKEN
CHAPTER XLIV OCTOBER 24TH.--THANK HEAVEN I AM FREE AND SAFE AT LAST
MAY NOT KINDRED SPIRITS MEET AND MINGLE IN COMMUNION WHATEVER BE THE FATE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR EARTHLY TENEMENTS THEY MAY THEY MAY CRIED SHE WITH A MOMENTARY BURST OF GLAD ENTHUSIASM
HE IS A TALL THIN GLOOMY-LOOKING MAN APPARENTLY BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY AND OF A SOMEWHAT SICKLY CAREWORN ASPECT
THE PARK AS BEAUTIFUL NOW IN ITS WINTRY GARB AS IT COULD BE IN ITS SUMMER GLORY
HUNTINGDON THREATENED ME WITH THE ETERNAL LOSS OF HIS FRIENDSHIP
I MAY CALL IT A PLEASANT AROMATIC FLAVOUR
YOU WILL CALL HER A PERFECT BEAUTY THOUGH YOU COULD HARDLY PRETEND TO DISCOVER A RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN HER AND ELIZA MILLWARD WELL I CAN IMAGINE MANY FACES MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ELIZA'S THOUGH NOT MORE CHARMING
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF HER AT ALL WHISPERED ROSE
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING SO COLD AND DRY IN THE MANNER OF IT THAT I WAS EFFECTUALLY DETERRED FROM REQUESTING A MORE DEFINITE ACCOUNT
FOR STILL HE IS ALWAYS IN MY THOUGHTS AND IN MY DREAMS
I WOULD DEMAND THE REASON OF THIS HATEFUL BARRIER THIS MYSTERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO MY HAPPINESS AND AS I TRUSTED TO HER OWN
WILLING TO BE SATISFIED WITH THIS I LEFT HER
I CARELESSLY TURNED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD LOOKING OUT UPON THE DESOLATE GARDEN LEAVING HER TO TALK TO ROSE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
AND LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT SUCH A PERSON EXISTED NO MATTER
IT IS THE SAME COOK AS WE HAD BEFORE YOU WENT ARTHUR SAID I
I COULD NOT BRING MY MIND TO DO SO BELIEVING AS I DID THAT LAWRENCE WAS INDEED AVERSE TO THE IDEA OF MY UNION WITH HIS SISTER
HAVING REMOUNTED MY HORSE I JUST LOOKED BACK TO SEE HOW HE WAS GETTING ON BEFORE I RODE AWAY
IN ALL THE COURSE OF HER CORRESPONDENCE WITH HER BROTHER OUR MUTUAL FRIEND AS SHE HERSELF HAD CALLED HIM SHE HAD NEVER MENTIONED ME BUT ONCE--AND THAT WAS FROM NECESSITY
YOUR OWN BAD SPIRIT WILL NOT LET ME
BUT YET WE NEVER MET WITHOUT MENTIONING HER FOR I NEVER SOUGHT HIS COMPANY BUT WITH THE HOPE OF HEARING SOMETHING ABOUT HER AND HE NEVER SOUGHT MINE AT ALL BECAUSE HE SAW ME OFTEN ENOUGH WITHOUT
BUT THESE MERRY TIMES ARE FAST DRAWING TO A CLOSE
AND SWORE THAT NEXT TIME HE SHOWED HIMSELF THEY WOULD TELL HIM AS MUCH AND IF HE DID NOT TAKE THE WARNING PROCEED TO ACTIVE MEASURES
YOU DON'T GRUDGE ME THESE ATTENTIONS DO YOU HELEN NO ARTHUR IF I COULD REALLY SERVE YOU BY THEM
BUT STILL IT WILL APPEAR IN HIS FACE AND HIS ILL-HUMOUR WILL PEEP OUT AT INTERVALS THOUGH NOT IN THE EXPRESSION OF OPEN RESENTMENT--THEY NEVER GO FAR ENOUGH FOR THAT
BUT IMMEDIATELY HE RESUMED HIS PLACE BESIDE MISS WILMOT AND FROM THAT HOUR TO THIS--DURING ALL THAT EVENING AND ALL THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT AND ALL THIS MORNING THE 22ND HE HAS NEVER GIVEN ME ONE KIND WORD OR ONE PLEASANT LOOK--NEVER SPOKEN TO ME BUT FROM PURE NECESSITY--NEVER GLANCED TOWARDS ME BUT WITH A COLD UNFRIENDLY LOOK I THOUGHT HIM QUITE INCAPABLE OF ASSUMING
AND THE OUTLINE OF HIS FACE THOUGH NOT FULL ENOUGH TO BE ROUND AND TOO FINELY CONVERGING TO THE SMALL DIMPLED CHIN TO BE SQUARE COULD NEVER BE DRAWN OUT TO THE LONG OVAL OF THE OTHER'S WHILE THE CHILD'S HAIR WAS EVIDENTLY OF A LIGHTER WARMER TINT THAN THE ELDER GENTLEMAN'S HAD EVER BEEN AND HIS LARGE CLEAR BLUE EYES THOUGH PREMATURELY SERIOUS AT TIMES WERE UTTERLY DISSIMILAR TO THE SHY HAZEL EYES OF MR LAWRENCE WHENCE THE SENSITIVE SOUL LOOKED SO DISTRUSTFULLY FORTH AS EVER READY TO RETIRE WITHIN FROM THE OFFENCES OF A TOO RUDE TOO UNCONGENIAL WORLD
BEFORE US
I HAD SCARCELY SETTLED TO MY WORK WHICH HOWEVER WANTED BUT A FEW TOUCHES TO THE FINISHING WHEN THE SPORTSMEN PASSED THE WINDOW ON THEIR RETURN FROM THE STABLES
ONE WOULD THINK AT SUCH A TIME YOU WOULD MOST EXULT IN YOUR PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO IMITATE THE VARIOUS BRILLIANT AND DELIGHTFUL TOUCHES OF NATURE NO
ARTHUR DID NOT TALK MUCH BUT HE LAUGHED AND LISTENED TO THE REST AND WAS IN PERFECT GOOD-HUMOUR THOUGH NOT EXCITED BY WINE
SHE'S A LITTLE MEEK PEACEABLE AFFECTIONATE BODY
WHAT KEEN GAMESTERS YOU ARE SAID MR HATTERSLEY WHO HAD NOW ENTERED AND BEEN WATCHING US FOR SOME TIME
BUT SO FREQUENTLY WAS I BAULKED IN MY EXPECTATIONS OF ANOTHER INTERVIEW SO CHANGEABLE WAS SHE IN HER TIMES OF COMING FORTH AND IN HER PLACES OF RESORT SO TRANSIENT WERE THE OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN THAT I FELT HALF INCLINED TO THINK SHE TOOK AS MUCH PAINS TO AVOID MY COMPANY AS I TO SEEK HERS
HARGRAVE WITHDREW WITH A LOOK OF COLD DISDAIN SAYING,--'YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME SHOULD YOU FEEL DISPOSED TO SEND A FRIEND MUTTERED OATHS AND CURSES WERE ALL THE ANSWER THIS INTIMATION OBTAINED
AND IF I CAN GAIN THE PUBLIC EAR AT ALL I WOULD RATHER WHISPER A FEW WHOLESOME TRUTHS THEREIN THAN MUCH SOFT NONSENSE
AND I FEAR IT IS TOO CERTAIN THAT YOUR TASTES AND FEELINGS MUST BE WIDELY ALTERED BEFORE YOU CAN HAVE ANY ENJOYMENT THERE
AUTHORISE ME TO CLEAR YOUR NAME FROM EVERY IMPUTATION
HE GRASPED IT VERY HARD AND IMMEDIATELY PUT SPURS TO HIS HORSE AND GALLOPED AWAY
BUT AS USUAL HE THROWS THE BLAME UPON ME
FOR THESE SIX YEARS HAVE WROUGHT ALMOST AS GREAT A CHANGE UPON HIMSELF AS ON MY FEELINGS REGARDING HIM
I TRUST TO YOUR HONOUR BEFORE I COULD ANSWER SHE HAD CLOSED THE CASEMENT AND TURNED AWAY
WHY NOT THE THING WAS ABSURD
CHAPTER IX THOUGH MY AFFECTIONS MIGHT NOW BE SAID TO BE FAIRLY WEANED FROM ELIZA MILLWARD I DID NOT YET ENTIRELY RELINQUISH MY VISITS TO THE VICARAGE BECAUSE I WANTED AS IT WERE TO LET HER DOWN EASY
VERY SOON AFTER I LEARNED THAT HE WAS GONE TO PARIS WHERE HE STILL IS
BUT THAT INDEFATIGABLE FOE WAS NOT YET VANQUISHED
THE TIME IS DRAWING NEAR
I THOUGHT SO HE LOOKED CONTEMPLATIVELY AT HIS HORSE'S MANE AS IF HE HAD SOME SERIOUS CAUSE OF DISSATISFACTION WITH IT OR SOMETHING ELSE
ONLY LET ME STATE THE TRUTH--SOME OF THE TRUTH AT LEAST,--AND SEE HEREAFTER IF ANY DARKER TRUTHS WILL BLOT THESE PAGES
HE MUST BE WRETCHED THOUGH HE MAY NOT KNOW IT
BUT I CAN SCARCELY IMAGINE SHE WILL MAKE HERSELF VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT ME BECAUSE I KNOW I AM NOT WORTHY OF IT EXCEPT IN MY APPRECIATION OF HER YOU ARE NEITHER OF YOU WORTHY OF A BROKEN HEART,--NOR OF ALL THE SIGHS AND TEARS AND SORROWFUL THOUGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN AND I FEAR WILL BE WASTED UPON YOU BOTH
YOU HEARD MY OATH ANSWERED LOWBOROUGH TURNING AWAY IN QUIET DESPAIR
HIS RECOVERY WAS NOT QUITE SO RAPID AS HE HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE
FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN LIVE TILL I KNOW SAID FERGUS VERY GRAVELY
INDEED FROM WHAT HE HAS UNGUARDEDLY TOLD ME OR HINTED FROM TIME TO TIME I CANNOT DOUBT THAT HE FREQUENTLY SHOWED THEM MY LETTERS TO LET THEM SEE HOW FONDLY HIS WIFE WATCHED OVER HIS INTERESTS AND HOW KEENLY SHE REGRETTED HIS ABSENCE
BUT PERHAPS THAT WOULD BE NO GREAT MATTER IT WOULD ENABLE ME TO CHOOSE WITH MY EYES OPEN--AND I SHOULD MAKE A GOOD HUSBAND IN SPITE OF IT
WILL YOU NO I WON'T MR HUNTINGDON
THERE'S THE BEST OF EM GONE ANYHOW
THAT SHE WAS IN FACT THE NOBLEST THE MOST ADORABLE OF HER SEX I HAD EVER BEHELD OR EVEN IMAGINED TO EXIST
I WOULD NOT BE MARRIED IN WINTER--IN DECEMBER AT LEAST SHE ADDED WITH A SHUDDER--FOR IN THAT MONTH HAD OCCURRED BOTH THE ILL-STARRED MARRIAGE THAT HAD BOUND HER TO HER FORMER HUSBAND AND THE TERRIBLE DEATH THAT RELEASED HER--'AND THEREFORE I SAID ANOTHER YEAR IN SPRING NEXT SPRING NO NO--NEXT AUTUMN PERHAPS SUMMER THEN WELL THE CLOSE OF SUMMER
AND DID HE KEEP HIS PROMISE
CAN I BE OTHERWISE WITH YOUR LOVE
IT MUST BE ENDURED
I AM WORKING HARD TO REPAY MY BROTHER FOR ALL HIS EXPENSES ON MY ACCOUNT
I WILL WRITE NO MORE ABOUT THAT
I DO NOT GENERALLY SIT UP AT NIGHT FOR I THINK THE NURSE WHO HAS MADE IT HER BUSINESS IS BETTER QUALIFIED FOR SUCH UNDERTAKINGS THAN I AM;--BUT STILL AN UNBROKEN NIGHT'S REST IS WHAT I BUT SELDOM ENJOY AND NEVER CAN VENTURE TO RECKON UPON
SURELY THAT MAN WILL MAKE ME DISLIKE HIM AT LAST
WHAT A PLEASURE AND COMFORT THAT LITTLE CREATURE MUST BE TO YOU MRS HUNTINGDON HE OBSERVED WITH A TOUCH OF SADNESS IN HIS INTONATION AS HE ADMIRINGLY CONTEMPLATED THE INFANT
AND SINKING ITS LITTLE WEARY HEAD ON HER BOSOM SOON DROPPED ASLEEP
NEVERTHELESS SHE HAD SAT A LONG TIME AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS THEY HAD FOUND A GOOD DEAL TO SAY TO EACH OTHER AND PARTED WITH A MUTUAL DESIRE TO MEET AGAIN
THAT SPOILS IT--I'D HOPED SHE WAS A WITCH OBSERVED FERGUS WHILE CARVING HIS INCH-THICK SLICE OF BREAD AND BUTTER
ONE FAINT RED GLIMMER CHEERED US FROM A WINDOW WHERE THE LATTICE WAS IN GOOD REPAIR
BUT NOT FAREWELL TO ALL MY FONDEST THOUGHTS OF THEE
WOULD I NOT LABOUR STILL TO DELIVER HIM FROM IT IF I COULD
HIS INJUSTICE AND ILL-HUMOUR TOWARDS HIS INFERIORS WHO COULD NOT DEFEND THEMSELVES I STILL RESENTED AND WITHSTOOD
NOW I SEE NO BEAUTY IN IT--NOTHING PLEASING IN ANY PART OF ITS EXPRESSION
DID SHE REGARD THIS AS AN INTIMATION THAT MODESTY ALONE PREVENTED ME FROM ASKING HER HAND
DON'T SPEAK SO LOUD WELL TELL ME THEN I ANSWERED IN A LOWER TONE WHAT IS IT YOU MEAN
SO YOU'VE NO EXCUSE THAT WAY WHILE SHE THUS REMONSTRATED I TOOK UP A BOOK AND LAYING IT OPEN ON THE TABLE BEFORE ME PRETENDED TO BE DEEPLY ABSORBED IN ITS PERUSAL FOR I WAS EQUALLY UNABLE TO JUSTIFY MYSELF AND UNWILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY ERRORS
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT
YOU MAY SAVE YOUR INDULGENCE AND CONSIDERATION FOR SOME MORE WORTHY OBJECT THAT WON'T TAX THEM SO HEAVILY BUT LET ME BEG YOU TO CONSULT YOUR AUNT
YOU'LL FIND NOTHING GONE BUT YOUR MONEY AND THE JEWELS AND A FEW LITTLE TRIFLES I THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE TO TAKE INTO MY OWN POSSESSION LEST YOUR MERCANTILE SPIRIT SHOULD BE TEMPTED TO TURN THEM INTO GOLD
NONE OF THEM COULD OR WOULD ATTEND YOU AS CAREFULLY AS I SHALL DO I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL SAID HE IN BEWILDERED PERPLEXITY
WHEN I THINK YOU CAN DO ANYTHING TO COMFORT ME I'LL MAKE BOLD TO TELL YOU PRAY DO!--I SUPPOSE I MAYN'T GUESS WHAT IT IS THAT TROUBLES YOU THERE'S NO NECESSITY FOR I'LL TELL YOU PLAINLY
AND TAKING FROM THE BOOK-CASE AN OLD VOLUME THAT I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY,--BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME OR HOW I COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF WITH SO SLIGHT AN EXCUSE
I NEVER WAS SO EASY SINCE THE FALL--QUITE GONE BY HEAVEN AND HE CLASPED AND KISSED MY HAND IN THE VERY FULNESS OF HIS HEART
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS A RUMPLE IN THE CARPET CAUSED BY THE HASTY PUSHING BACK OF HIS MASTER'S CHAIR AT WHICH HE TRIPPED AND STUMBLED CAUSING A RATHER ALARMING CONCUSSION WITH THE TRAYFUL OF CROCKERY IN HIS HANDS BUT NO POSITIVE DAMAGE SAVE THE FALL AND BREAKING OF A SAUCE TUREEN
BUT CAN YOU SUPPOSE IT WOULD OFFEND THAT BENEVOLENT BEING TO MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF ONE WHO WOULD DIE FOR YOURS?--TO RAISE A DEVOTED HEART FROM PURGATORIAL TORMENTS TO A STATE OF HEAVENLY BLISS WHEN YOU COULD DO IT WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO YOURSELF OR ANY OTHER THIS WAS SPOKEN IN A LOW EARNEST MELTING TONE AS HE BENT OVER ME
I'M NOTHING AT ALL OF THE KIND AND NEVER WAS AND NEVER SHALL BE
HAD HE BELIEVED THAT A UNION WAS NECESSARY TO THE HAPPINESS OF BOTH OR OF EITHER OR HAD HE KNOWN HOW FERVENTLY I LOVED HER HE WOULD HAVE ACTED DIFFERENTLY
SO PRAY DON'T SAY ANY MORE ABOUT IT WHEREUPON HE WISHED ME A GOOD-MORNING AND WITHDREW DISCONCERTED AND OFFENDED NO DOUBT
BUT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT HIM NOW BUT ABOUT MR BOARHAM
TO-DAY AND TO-NIGHT SHE MAY THINK UPON HER SINS AND BE AS MISERABLE AS SHE WILL
IT MAY BE NATURAL ENOUGH THAT IN HER IGNORANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP SHE SHOULD FEEL SOME DEGREE OF ENMITY AGAINST HER BUT NO GOOD OR AMIABLE WOMAN WOULD BE CAPABLE OF EVINCING THAT BITTER COLD-BLOODED DESIGNING MALICE TOWARDS A FANCIED RIVAL THAT I HAVE OBSERVED IN HER MARKHAM YES--AND IT IS MY BELIEF THAT ELIZA MILLWARD AND SHE IF NOT THE VERY ORIGINATORS OF THE SLANDEROUS REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPAGATED WERE DESIGNEDLY THE ENCOURAGERS AND CHIEF DISSEMINATORS OF THEM
NO SLEEP I COULD HAVE GOT THIS NIGHT WOULD HAVE DONE SO MUCH TOWARDS COMPOSING MY MIND AND PREPARING ME TO MEET THE TRIALS OF THE DAY
IT IS OBVIOUSLY THEREFORE MY INTEREST TO DISAPPOINT THEM BOTH AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED BY PRESERVING A CHEERFUL UNDISTURBED SERENITY THROUGHOUT
HE QUIETLY PUSHED A CHAIR TOWARDS ME
HOW MUCH OF THE SCENE HE HAD WITNESSED I DO NOT KNOW FOR THE DOOR WAS AJAR WHEN HE ENTERED
IN THIS BELIEVE ME I WAS ACTUATED BY NO MOTIVES OF REVENGE FOR THE OCCASIONAL ANNOYANCES I HAD LATELY SUSTAINED FROM HIM,--NOR YET BY ANY FEELING OF MALEVOLENT ENMITY TOWARDS MISS WILSON BUT PURELY BY THE FACT THAT I COULD NOT ENDURE THAT SUCH A WOMAN SHOULD BE MRS HUNTINGDON'S SISTER AND THAT AS WELL FOR HIS OWN SAKE AS FOR HERS I COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK OF HIS BEING DECEIVED INTO A UNION WITH ONE SO UNWORTHY OF HIM AND SO UTTERLY UNFITTED TO BE THE PARTNER OF HIS QUIET HOME AND THE COMPANION OF HIS LIFE
BUT HE IS A MAN WITHOUT SELF-RESTRAINT OR LOFTY ASPIRATIONS A LOVER OF PLEASURE GIVEN UP TO ANIMAL ENJOYMENTS
YOU ARE POORLY MA'AM SAID RACHEL SURVEYING ME WITH DEEP ANXIETY
HIS AFFAIRS THERE DEMANDED HIS ATTENDANCE HE SAID AND HE COULD REFUSE IT NO LONGER
AND SO NEVER PAUSE TO THINK BUT FILL UP WITH AIMLESS TRIFLES AND VAIN REPETITIONS WHEN SUBJECTS OF REAL INTEREST FAIL TO PRESENT THEMSELVES OR DO THEY REALLY TAKE A PLEASURE IN SUCH DISCOURSE VERY LIKELY THEY DO SAID I
THEN YOU WON'T TAKE THE BOOK I ASKED MORE MILDLY THAN I HAD YET SPOKEN
CHEER UP MAN HE CONTINUED GIVING LORD LOWBOROUGH A THUMP ON THE BACK WHICH CAUSED THE LATTER TO RECOIL FROM HIM WITH LOOKS OF INEFFABLE DISGUST AND IRRITATION
I WAS WEARIED TO DEATH WITH SMALL TALK--NOTHING WEARS ME OUT LIKE THAT
IT IS INFAMOUS HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
I MAY REGRET THIS BUT I CANNOT BLAME YOU FOR IT I SHALL NOT REJOICE AT YOUR DEPARTURE FOR YOU CAN CONDUCT YOURSELF LIKE A GENTLEMAN SAID I THINKING IT BUT RIGHT TO MAKE SOME ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR HIS GOOD BEHAVIOUR
HIS SOMBRE COUNTENANCE WAS BEAUTIFIED BY SMILES
BUT HOWEVER IF YOU WISH IT I'LL TRY TO ENDURE HIS PRESENCE FOR A WHILE ALL A PREJUDICE HELEN A MERE WOMAN'S ANTIPATHY NO
AND I SAID IN MY HEART--'I WOULD RATHER ADMIRE YOU FROM THIS DISTANCE FAIR LADY THAN BE THE PARTNER OF YOUR HOME JUST THEN SHE HAPPENED TO RAISE HER EYES AND THEY MET MINE
HE'S FAIRLY IN LOVE
I ONLY STAYED TO PUT AWAY MY GUN AND POWDER-HORN AND GIVE SOME REQUISITE DIRECTIONS TO ONE OF THE FARMING-MEN AND THEN REPAIRED TO THE VICARAGE TO SOLACE MY SPIRIT AND SOOTHE MY RUFFLED TEMPER WITH THE COMPANY AND CONVERSATION OF ELIZA MILLWARD
9TH.--YESTERDAY WHEN RACHEL CAME TO DRESS ME FOR DINNER I SAW THAT SHE HAD BEEN CRYING
AND THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS TO TELL TALES ABOUT THEIR MASTERS NO MUM--OR ELSE THEY HAVE SAID SOME THINGS ABOUT MR HUNTINGDON TOO I WON'T HEAR THEM RACHEL
BUT I LEFT THE GLASS BY HIM
I FOLLOWED AT A LITTLE DISTANCE
IT WAS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF ENJOYMENT IN ITSELF
BUT SHE STILL WAS KIND
WE HAD NOT BEEN THUS SECLUDED ABOVE TWO HOURS HOWEVER WHEN MR HATTERSLEY CAME IN ATTRACTED I SUPPOSE BY THE VOICE OF HIS CHILD AS HE WAS CROSSING THE HALL FOR HE IS PRODIGIOUSLY FOND OF HER AND SHE OF HIM
BUT WHAT SHOULD I DO
THEN MRS HUNTINGDON YOU DO NOT FORGIVE ME YES
THERE'LL BE BRAVE DOINGS ON YONDER TO-DAY AS WHAT COME TO-MORRA.--KNOW ANYTHING OF THAT FAMILY SIR
THAT LAST LOOK OF HERS HAD SUNK INTO MY HEART
FOR A WHILE HE MANAGED VERY WELL
LET ME GO MR HUNTINGDON SAID I
FILL AGAIN SAID I HANDING HIM THE BOTTLE--"AND LET US DRINK TO YOUR RENUNCIATION IT'S RANK POISON SAID HE GRASPING THE BOTTLE BY THE NECK AND I FORSWEAR IT
THIS IS THE FIRST INSTALMENT OF MY DEBT
I KNOW IT WAS SOME OF HIS FRIENDS THAT INDUCED HIM TO STAY BEHIND ME IN LONDON AND KEPT HIM AWAY SO LONG
AND I AM CALM NOW REALLY
HER IMPUDENCE ASTOUNDED ME
NOW IF I COULD PERSUADE HIM TO HAVE ONE OR TWO ROOMS MADE HABITABLE AND TO LET THEM TO ME AS A STRANGER I MIGHT LIVE THERE WITH MY CHILD UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME AND STILL SUPPORT MYSELF BY MY FAVOURITE ART
BUT IN SPITE OF MY EFFORTS TO REMAIN COMPOSED MY ATTENTION WANDERED FROM THE DRAWINGS TO THE MERRY GROUP AND AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT MY WRATH ROSE AND DOUBTLESS MY COUNTENANCE LOWERED
AND I WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE THE RESULT OF IT
AND I SOMETIMES SOUGHT AND OBTAINED AMUSEMENT IN THE COMPANY OF MY YOUNG FRIEND ESTHER HARGRAVE
I KNEW ANNABELLA'S MUSICAL TALENTS WERE SUPERIOR TO MINE BUT THAT WAS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD BE TREATED AS A PERFECT NONENTITY
ON RETURNING TO THE SCENE OF OUR REPAST WE FOUND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DESERTED IT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THREE--MARY MILLWARD RICHARD WILSON AND ARTHUR GRAHAM
IT WAVED HER DROOPING RINGLETS AND IMPARTED A LIVELIER COLOUR TO HER USUALLY TOO PALLID LIP AND CHEEK
PERHAPS HE WAS AS MUCH CHARMED WITH HER PERFORMANCE AS SHE WAS
BUT GREATLY AS I ABHORRED HIM AT THAT MOMENT I DID NOT LIKE TO TREAT HIM WITH RUDENESS AS I WAS NOW HIS GUEST AND HAD JUST BEEN ENJOYING HIS HOSPITALITY
WHAT SHOULD I DO THEN
AS FOR ME I WAS HUNGRY AND CONTENTED MYSELF WITH SILENTLY DEMOLISHING THE TEA HAM AND TOAST WHILE MY MOTHER AND SISTER WENT ON TALKING AND CONTINUED TO DISCUSS THE APPARENT OR NON-APPARENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND PROBABLE OR IMPROBABLE HISTORY OF THE MYSTERIOUS LADY
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO SHOW THEM TO ME AND TOLD HIM I DID NOT WISH TO SEE THEM
ARTHUR IS NOT WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED A BAD MAN
FOR INSTEAD OF DELIVERING MYSELF UP TO THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF THEM AS OTHERS DO I AM ALWAYS TROUBLING MY HEAD ABOUT HOW I COULD PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT UPON CANVAS
IT IS NOW TWO MONTHS SINCE OUR GUESTS LEFT US TO THE ENJOYMENT OF EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY
DO YOU REALLY RALPH MURMURED SHE WITH A FAINT SMILE BEAMING THROUGH HER TEARS JUST PUTTING UP HER HAND TO HIS IN TOKEN THAT HE PULLED RATHER TOO HARD
I ONLY KNOW THAT I HAVE HEARD NOTHING DEFINITE AGAINST IT--NOTHING THAT COULD BE PROVED AT LEAST
MOST OF THE HAY WAS CUT BUT THE LAST WEEK HAD BEEN VERY UNFAVOURABLE
YOU OUGHT TO BE AWARE THAT WHATEVER MY HUSBAND'S FAULTS MAY BE IT CAN ONLY AGGRAVATE THE EVIL FOR ME TO HEAR THEM FROM A STRANGER'S LIPS AM I THEN A STRANGER SAID HE IN A SORROWFUL TONE
BUT YOU FORGIVE ME?--I HAVE DONE VERY VERY WRONG I KNOW
HE MAY BE ALL THIS BUT BUT HELEN
DO NOW
WHILE I STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS ABSTRACTEDLY GAZING ON THE UNDULATING SWELL OF THE CORN NOT YET DISTURBED BY THE REAPERS SOMETHING GENTLY PULLED MY SKIRTS AND A SMALL VOICE NO LONGER WELCOME TO MY EARS AROUSED ME WITH THE STARTLING WORDS,--'MR MARKHAM MAMMA WANTS YOU WANTS ME ARTHUR YES
I AM AT PRESENT WRITING A WORK ON THE FIRST WAR
THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS VERY WELL GOT UP
SHE BOWED AND SO DID I AND THEN SHE WITHDREW HER HEAD WHILE ARTHUR SCREAMED TO THE FOOTMAN TO LET HIM OUT
AND MY SISTER'S FEELINGS ARE NATURALLY FULL AS KEEN AS YOURS AND I BELIEVE MORE CONSTANT
WHILE YOU ARE DOING YOUR DUTY ARTHUR I SHALL NEVER COMPLAIN OF NEGLECT
WENT WHERE TO GRASSDALE SIR--WASN'T YOU AWARE SIR
THOUGH OFTEN LESS PROTRACTED THAN BEFORE
YOU MUST LEAVE US NOW AFTER LUNCH AND COME AGAIN IN SPRING AND MAKE A LONGER STAY AND CULTIVATE HER ACQUAINTANCE AND I KNOW YOU WILL LIKE EACH OTHER AND THEN YOU WILL BE MINE SAID I PRINTING A KISS UPON HER LIPS AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER
CHAPTER XXII OCTOBER 5TH.--MY CUP OF SWEETS IS NOT UNMINGLED
I SEE SHE IS PLAYING DOUBLE BETWEEN HIM AND LORD LOWBOROUGH AND WHILE SHE AMUSES HERSELF WITH THE LIVELY HUNTINGDON SHE TRIES HER UTMOST TO ENSLAVE HIS MOODY FRIEND
I HAVE LAID HIM IN MY BED FOR BETTER SECURITY AND NEVER MORE I TRUST SHALL HIS INNOCENT LIPS BE DEFILED BY THEIR CONTAMINATING KISSES OR HIS YOUNG EARS POLLUTED BY THEIR WORDS
ON THE CONTRARY I FELT MY FACE GLOW WITH REDOUBLED FIRES KINDLED BY A COMPLICATION OF EMOTIONS OF WHICH INDIGNANT SWELLING ANGER WAS THE CHIEF
BUT OBSERVING THAT HE KEPT GAZING TOWARDS THE FOOT OF THE BED I WENT AND SAT THERE PLACING THE LIGHT SO AS TO SHINE FULL UPON ME FOR I THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE DYING AND I WANTED HIM TO KNOW ME
IF I MAY NE'ER BEHOLD AGAIN THAT FORM AND FACE SO DEAR TO ME NOR HEAR THY VOICE STILL WOULD I FAIN PRESERVE FOR AYE THEIR MEMORY
IF THOU HADST NEVER MET MINE EYE I HAD NOT DREAMED A LIVING FACE COULD FANCIED CHARMS SO FAR OUTVIE
I WAS AS MUCH ASTONISHED AS EXASPERATED AT THIS SINGULAR PERTINACITY AND IMPERTURBABLE ASSURANCE ON HIS PART
AND I CANNOT BESTOW MY ESTEEM ON ALL WHO DESIRE IT UNLESS THEY DESERVE IT TOO I SHALL THINK MY LIFE WELL SPENT IN LABOURING TO DESERVE IT IF YOU WILL BUT PARDON THIS OFFENCE--WILL YOU YES YES
THE NEXT WAS STILL MORE DISTRESSING IN THE TENOR OF ITS CONTENTS
I THINK IT'S TIME
AND IF FOR A WHILE I DARKENED HIS PROSPECTS BY STANDING BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SUN--AND SO NEARLY PLUNGED HIM AGAIN INTO THE ABYSS OF DESPAIR--IT ONLY INTENSIFIED HIS ARDOUR AND STRENGTHENED HIS HOPES WHEN I CHOSE TO ABANDON THE FIELD IN THE PURSUIT OF A BRIGHTER TREASURE
HE HAD NOT ATTEMPTED TO CHEEK THE COURSE OF OUR LOVE BY ACTUALLY DAMMING UP THE STREAMS IN THEIR PASSAGE BUT HE HAD PASSIVELY WATCHED THE TWO CURRENTS WANDERING THROUGH LIFE'S ARID WILDERNESS DECLINING TO CLEAR AWAY THE OBSTRUCTIONS THAT DIVIDED THEM AND SECRETLY HOPING THAT BOTH WOULD LOSE THEMSELVES IN THE SAND BEFORE THEY COULD BE JOINED IN ONE
AND HE SAID IT WAS YOUR OWN SOUR TEMPER THAT WAS EATING AWAY YOUR BLOOM
WELL AUNT WHAT IS IT
I SAW MY SWEET GIRL WAS NOT WITHOUT HER FAULTS BUT OF THESE HER YOUTH I TRUSTED WAS NOT ONE BUT RATHER AN EARNEST OF VIRTUES YET UNBLOWN--A STRONG GROUND OF PRESUMPTION THAT HER LITTLE DEFECTS OF TEMPER AND ERRORS OF JUDGMENT OPINION OR MANNER WERE NOT IRREMEDIABLE BUT MIGHT EASILY BE REMOVED OR MITIGATED BY THE PATIENT EFFORTS OF A WATCHFUL AND JUDICIOUS ADVISER AND WHERE I FAILED TO ENLIGHTEN AND CONTROL I THOUGHT I MIGHT SAFELY UNDERTAKE TO PARDON FOR THE SAKE OF HER MANY EXCELLENCES
BUT WHAT THEN
AS HE BEGAN TO RECOVER THE TONE AND VIGOUR OF HIS EXHAUSTED FRAME AND WITH IT SOMETHING OF HIS FORMER IMPATIENCE OF RETIREMENT AND REPOSE I SUGGESTED A SHORT RESIDENCE BY THE SEA-SIDE FOR HIS RECREATION AND FURTHER RESTORATION AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR LITTLE ONE AS WELL
IT WAS NOT FOR THAT I BROUGHT YOU HERE
BUT JUST THEN I FELT THE RESTRAINT ALMOST INTOLERABLE AND I HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN FORCING MYSELF TO ATTEND TO HER REMARKS AND ANSWER THEM WITH ORDINARY POLITENESS
A CONSIDERABLE TIME AFTER CAME LORD LOWBOROUGH IN HIS BAROUCHE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN ASKED THE LADY
FOR YOU LADIES LAVISH SO MANY CARESSES UPON THEM BLESS THEM--LITTLE DARLINGS CRIED SHE IN A SUDDEN BURST OF ENTHUSIASM TURNING ROUND AND OVERWHELMING HER SISTER'S PET WITH A SHOWER OF KISSES
IT ISN'T ONLY THE WANT OF MONEY THAT I THINK ABOUT--NOTHING OF THE KIND--BUT THERE'S NEITHER BEAUTY NOR CLEVERNESS NOR GOODNESS NOR ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S DESIRABLE
THERE WAS ONE IN AN OBSCURE CORNER THAT I HAD NOT BEFORE OBSERVED
AND A VERY FITTING STUDY FOR A YOUNG LADY
UPON THIS BOUGH THAT STOOD OUT IN BOLD RELIEF AGAINST THE SOMBRE FIRS WERE SEATED AN AMOROUS PAIR OF TURTLE DOVES WHOSE SOFT SAD-COLOURED PLUMAGE AFFORDED A CONTRAST OF ANOTHER NATURE
HAVE I NO FAITH IN GOD
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SORT OF MAN MR HUNTINGDON IS SAID I
HE STILL HAS AN UNFORTUNATE PREDILECTION FOR THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE AGAINST WHICH I HAVE TO STRUGGLE AND WATCH
I APPROACHED THE LITTLE RURAL CHURCH--BUT LO
THEY BRING TROUBLE AND DISCOMFORT WHEREVER THEY COME WITH THEIR FALSE FAIR FACES AND THEIR DECEITFUL TONGUES AT THIS JUNCTURE I ISSUED FROM MY RETREAT AND SMILING ON MR GRIMSBY AS I PASSED LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF ARTHUR
TO BE SURE I ASKED NO QUESTIONS ON THE SUBJECT
I DARESAY I LOOKED AS FIERCE AND RESOLUTE AS HE
THIS PAPER WILL SERVE INSTEAD OF A CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND INTO WHOSE EAR I MIGHT POUR FORTH THE OVERFLOWINGS OF MY HEART
MEANWHILE POOR ARTHUR WAS SADLY AT A LOSS FOR SOMETHING TO AMUSE HIM OR TO OCCUPY HIS TIME
SO I RAN TO THE VICARAGE AND FETCHED HER
FOR WHILE THE FORMER RAN OVER THE PAGES THE LATTER WAS EARNESTLY WONDERING WHEN ARTHUR WOULD SPEAK NEXT AND WHAT HE WOULD SAY AND WHAT I SHOULD ANSWER
HELEN SAID HE WITH UNUSUAL GRAVITY I AM NOT QUITE SATISFIED WITH YOU I DESIRED TO KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG
THE NEXT LETTER BROUGHT INTELLIGENCE THAT THE MALADY WAS FAST INCREASING
BUT MY FATHER WHO THOUGHT AMBITION WAS THE SUREST ROAD TO RUIN AND CHANGE BUT ANOTHER WORD FOR DESTRUCTION WOULD LISTEN TO NO SCHEME FOR BETTERING EITHER MY OWN CONDITION OR THAT OF MY FELLOW MORTALS
NO INTIMATION THAT MY NAME HAD EVER PASSED HER LIPS OR EVEN BEEN SPOKEN IN HER PRESENCE
AND NOW HATTERSLEY HAS LEFT HIM EXPRESSING A HOPE THAT HE SHALL FIND HIM BETTER WHEN HE CALLS TO-MORROW
FOR SO LONG AS I DISCHARGE MY FUNCTIONS OF STEWARD AND HOUSE-KEEPER SO CONSCIENTIOUSLY AND WELL WITHOUT PAY AND WITHOUT THANKS YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO PART WITH ME
YOU MUSTN'T MIND MY TALK MILLY
YOU ARE MISTAKEN THERE
CAN I FIND COMFORT OR CONSOLATION--PEACE CERTAINTY CONTENTMENT ALL--OR ANYTHING THAT I WANT AT HOME
FIRST LET ME SPEAK OF HIS ARRIVAL--HOW I SAT AT MY WINDOW AND WATCHED FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS BEFORE HIS CARRIAGE ENTERED THE PARK-GATES--FOR THEY ALL CAME BEFORE HIM,--AND HOW DEEPLY I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT EVERY ARRIVAL BECAUSE IT WAS NOT HIS
OH READER
THEN ALARMED AT MY AGITATION HE BEGGED ME NOT TO PUT MYSELF IN SUCH A PASSION TELLING ME I WAS WHITE IN THE FACE AND SHOULD KILL MYSELF IF I DID SO
THAT SHARP-SIGHTED WOMAN SOON GUESSED HOW MATTERS STOOD BETWEEN US AND DESCRYING THE ENEMY'S MOVEMENTS FROM HER ELEVATION AT THE NURSERY-WINDOW SHE WOULD GIVE ME A QUIET INTIMATION IF SHE SAW ME PREPARING FOR A WALK WHEN SHE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HE WAS ABOUT OR TO THINK IT LIKELY THAT HE WOULD MEET OR OVERTAKE ME IN THE WAY I MEANT TO TRAVERSE
IT NEEDED NOT THE WHITE FAVOURS BEDECKING THE SERVANTS AND HORSES NOR THE MERRY VOICES OF THE VILLAGE IDLERS ASSEMBLED TO WITNESS THE SHOW TO APPRISE ME THAT THERE WAS A WEDDING WITHIN
BUT AM I NOT BECOMING MORE INDIFFERENT AND INSENSATE TOO
I AM COME AT AN UNSEASONABLE HOUR SAID I ASSUMING A CHEERFULNESS I DID NOT FEEL IN ORDER TO REASSURE HER
WELL THEY WERE TALKING OF THESE THINGS AND SOME OF THEM REMARKED THAT AS SHE WAS SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND HE MIGHT SEE HER AGAIN WHEN HE PLEASED THANK YOU SAID HE
AND I WILL DRINK IT TO THE VERY DREGS
YOU WOULD BE WRONGING THE GIRL IF SHE WERE WHAT SHE OUGHT TO BE
WHAT NOW SAID HE
IF RACHEL IS SATISFIED WITH SUCH A LIFE WHY SHOULD NOT I?--INDEED I CANNOT BE TOO THANKFUL FOR SUCH AN ASYLUM WHILE IT IS LEFT ME THE CLOSING SENTENCE WAS UTTERED IN AN UNDER-TONE AS IF SPOKEN RATHER TO HERSELF THAN TO ME
BUT IT SEEMS I WAS MISTAKEN
BUT IT SEEMS I WAS MISTAKEN
HE DOES NOT NOW AS FORMERLY LAUGH THESE BLESSED TRUTHS TO SCORN
MY YOUTH IS WASTING AWAY
I'LL JUST TELL YOU HE CONTINUED AS IF ACTUATED BY A SUDDEN RESOLUTION WHAT WAS SAID LAST NIGHT IN THE DINING-ROOM AFTER YOU LEFT US
MY AUNT LOOKING COMPLACENTLY ON ALL THE TIME AND WISHING HIM GOD-SPEED
AND I HOPE YOU WILL NOT REFUSE TO MAKE ONE MRS GRAHAM
NOW I LIKE A WOMAN TO BE RELIGIOUS AND I THINK YOUR PIETY ONE OF YOUR GREATEST CHARMS
OF COURSE MR HARGRAVE
CHAPTER XXVII OCTOBER 9TH.--IT WAS ON THE NIGHT OF THE 4TH A LITTLE AFTER TEA THAT ANNABELLA HAD BEEN SINGING AND PLAYING WITH ARTHUR AS USUAL AT HER SIDE
READ THAT AND TAKE A LESSON BY IT IT WAS IN THE FREE DASHING HAND OF LADY LOWBOROUGH
I SCORN TO JUSTIFY MYSELF TO YOU SAID I
AND IF I LEAVE YOU I'LL NEVER GO INTO PLACE AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE LIKE A LADY NOW RETURNED I
BUT HE'S SUCH DEVILISH GOOD COMPANY IS HUNTINGDON AFTER ALL
THIS LITTLE LEDGE COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN THEM ALL I'M GLAD FOR I'M TIRED OF TALKING WELL THEN I WON'T TALK
AND PERHAPS IF SHE USED A LITTLE GENTLE BUT SERIOUS REMONSTRANCE WITH HER HUSBAND IT MIGHT BE OF SOME SERVICE
AND I WILL CLEAR AS MANY STONES FROM HIS PATH AS I CAN AND TEACH HIM TO AVOID THE REST--OR WALK FIRMLY OVER THEM AS YOU SAY;--FOR WHEN I HAVE DONE MY UTMOST IN THE WAY OF CLEARANCE THERE WILL STILL BE PLENTY LEFT TO EXERCISE ALL THE AGILITY STEADINESS AND CIRCUMSPECTION HE WILL EVER HAVE.--IT IS ALL VERY WELL TO TALK ABOUT NOBLE RESISTANCE AND TRIALS OF VIRTUE
YOU DO NOT COMPLAIN BUT I SEE--AND FEEL--AND KNOW THAT YOU ARE MISERABLE--AND MUST REMAIN SO AS LONG AS YOU KEEP THOSE WALLS OF IMPENETRABLE ICE ABOUT YOUR STILL WARM AND PALPITATING HEART
AND THAT NO ONE SUFFERS FOR MY FOLLY--IN A PECUNIARY WAY AT LEAST
HER LIMITED BUT CHOICE COLLECTION OF BOOKS WAS ALMOST AS FAMILIAR TO ME AS MY OWN
HE THOUGHT HE NEVER COULD BE AGAIN BUT HE'S IN FOR IT ONCE MORE
AND HOW WAS SHE I EAGERLY ASKED
AND THEN I SAW AT ONCE THE FOLLY OF THE HOPES I HAD CHERISHED AND THE MADNESS OF RETAINING THEM A MOMENT LONGER
AND I THINK MRS MARKHAM I MUST BEG YOU TO MAKE MY EXCUSES TO THE MILLWARDS AND MRS WILSON WHEN YOU SEE THEM AS I FEAR I CANNOT DO MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF CALLING UPON THEM TILL MY LITTLE ARTHUR IS ABLE TO ACCOMPANY ME BUT YOU HAVE A SERVANT SAID ROSE
BUT I WAS NOT SO MINDED
BUT I THOUGHT OF YOU IN THE MIDST OF THOSE LAWLESS ROYSTERERS
FOR ANY OTHER COMBINATION OF OFFENCES I WOULD
ABOUT A WEEK AFTER MR HARGRAVE BROUGHT HIS SISTER TO SEE ME
AND I BELIEVE THE ONLY EFFECTUAL CAUSES OF THE VACILLATING INDECISION THAT HAD PRESERVED HIM HITHERTO FROM MAKING AN ACTUAL DECLARATION OF LOVE WAS THE CONSIDERATION OF HER CONNECTIONS AND ESPECIALLY OF HER MOTHER WHOM HE COULD NOT ABIDE
NO WORDS HAVE PASSED BETWEEN US SINCE BUT SUCH AS OUTWARD DECENCY OR PURE NECESSITY DEMANDED
SHE DOES NOT SCRUPLE TO SPEAK TO MY HUSBAND WITH AFFECTIONATE FAMILIARITY IN MY PRESENCE WHEN NO ONE ELSE IS BY AND IS PARTICULARLY FOND OF DISPLAYING HER INTEREST IN HIS HEALTH AND WELFARE OR IN ANYTHING THAT CONCERNS HIM AS IF FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTRASTING HER KIND SOLICITUDE WITH MY COLD INDIFFERENCE
HAD I BEEN ENDOWED WITH A PROPER DEGREE OF SELF-POSSESSION I SHOULD HAVE TURNED TO THE LADY MYSELF AND CHEERFULLY JOINED MY ENTREATIES TO HIS WHEREBY I SHOULD HAVE DISAPPOINTED HIS EXPECTATIONS IF THE AFFRONT HAD BEEN PURPOSELY GIVEN OR MADE HIM SENSIBLE OF THE WRONG IF IT HAD ONLY ARISEN FROM THOUGHTLESSNESS
AND HE WILL IMPROVE DON'T YOU THINK SO HELEN
BUT I HAVE KNOWN HER LONGER AND STUDIED HER MORE CLOSELY THAN YOU HAVE DONE.--AND I CAN TELL YOU MR HATTERSLEY THAT MILICENT LOVES YOU MORE THAN YOU DESERVE AND THAT YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO MAKE HER VERY HAPPY INSTEAD OF WHICH YOU ARE HER EVIL GENIUS AND I WILL VENTURE TO SAY THERE IS NOT A SINGLE DAY PASSES IN WHICH YOU DO NOT INFLICT UPON HER SOME PANG THAT YOU MIGHT SPARE HER IF YOU WOULD WELL--IT'S NOT MY FAULT SAID HE GAZING CARELESSLY UP AT THE CEILING AND PLUNGING HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS
HIS FACE WAS GHASTLY PALE
I SNATCHED UP MY PALETTE-KNIFE AND HELD IT AGAINST HIM
I HEARD HIM SAY,--"I SHALL MANAGE IT YOU'LL SEE
WOULDN'T YOU NELL YES UNCLE
I AM NOT DREAMING OF THAT;--BUT IF I WERE TO WRITE A SHORT NOTE NOW NOT MENTIONING YOU MARKHAM BUT JUST GIVING A SLIGHT ACCOUNT OF MY ILLNESS BY WAY OF EXCUSE FOR MY NOT COMING TO SEE HER AND TO PUT HER ON HER GUARD AGAINST ANY EXAGGERATED REPORTS SHE MAY HEAR,--AND ADDRESS IT IN A DISGUISED HAND--WOULD YOU DO ME THE FAVOUR TO SLIP IT INTO THE POST-OFFICE AS YOU PASS
I WAS SORRY TO GO FOR I HAD FOUND MY NEW ACQUAINTANCE A VERY LIVELY AND ENTERTAINING COMPANION
BUT I WAS RATHER OFFENDED AT HER EVIDENT DESIRE TO BE RID OF ME AND WAS BEGINNING TO REPENT OF MY PERTINACITY WHEN SHE SOMEWHAT APPEASED ME BY CONSULTING MY TASTE AND JUDGMENT ABOUT SOME DOUBTFUL MATTER IN HER DRAWING
FOR SOMEHOW THESE OLD CHAPS DON'T GO DOWN WITH THE GIRLS--WITH ALL THEIR MONEY AND THEIR EXPERIENCE TO BOOT
BUT HE ONLY LAUGHED AND SAID,--'YOU CAN FEEL FOR HIM HELEN CAN'T YOU I CAN FEEL FOR ANYONE THAT IS UNJUSTLY TREATED I REPLIED AND I CAN FEEL FOR THOSE THAT INJURE THEM TOO WHY HELEN YOU ARE AS JEALOUS AS HE IS CRIED HE LAUGHING STILL MORE
BUT WHAT THEN MILICENT WELL SINCE YOU HAVE SO MUCH INFLUENCE WITH HER I WISH YOU WOULD SERIOUSLY IMPRESS IT UPON HER NEVER ON ANY ACCOUNT OR FOR ANYBODY'S PERSUASION TO MARRY FOR THE SAKE OF MONEY OR RANK OR ESTABLISHMENT OR ANY EARTHLY THING BUT TRUE AFFECTION AND WELL-GROUNDED ESTEEM THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR THAT SAID I FOR WE HAVE HAD SOME DISCOURSE ON THAT SUBJECT ALREADY AND I ASSURE YOU HER IDEAS OF LOVE AND MATRIMONY ARE AS ROMANTIC AS ANY ONE COULD DESIRE BUT ROMANTIC NOTIONS WILL NOT DO
DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH ART WHISPERED ELIZA WHO WAS MY NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
I HAVE A STRONG WILL BUT SO HAS SHE AND WHEN SHE SAYS SUCH BITTER THINGS IT PROVOKES ME TO SUCH A PASS THAT I FEEL INCLINED TO DO AS SHE BIDS ME AND THEN BREAK MY HEART AND SAY THERE MAMMA IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT PRAY DON'T SAID I
HIS LETTERS NOW
THERE WAS A SUDDEN IMPULSE THAT NEITHER COULD RESIST
IT WAS UNGENEROUS AND WRONG TO WITHDRAW YOURSELF SO SECRETLY AND SUDDENLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER SUCH ARDENT PROTESTATIONS OF ATTACHMENT WITHOUT EVER ASSIGNING A REASON FOR THE CHANGE
HE HAS NO MORE IDEA OF EXERTING HIMSELF TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES THAN HE HAS OF RESTRAINING HIS NATURAL APPETITES
TAKE IT I PRESSED IT EARNESTLY TO MY LIPS AND PUT IT IN MY BOSOM MRS HUNTINGDON LOOKING ON WITH A HALF-SARCASTIC SMILE
NOT QUITE TWENTY MILES I ANSWERED
SHE WAS STARTLED AT FIRST BY THE DECLARATION SO UNEXPECTED AND SO DETERMINATELY YET CALMLY DELIVERED
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY BELIEVED ME BUT EVERYBODY SOON LEARNED TO AVOID INSINUATING A WORD AGAINST HER OR EVEN MENTIONING HER NAME IN MY PRESENCE
AND SHE EXECUTED HER COMMISSION BUT TOO WELL--FOR AMONG THE REST SHE PUT UP A PORTRAIT OF MR HUNTINGDON THAT I HAD PAINTED IN THE FIRST YEAR OF MY MARRIAGE
AND SO WE ARE BROUGHT BACK TO THE POINT FROM WHICH WE STARTED
YOU ARE MY ANGEL MY DIVINITY
TO-NIGHT I HEARD GRIMSBY AND HATTERSLEY GRUMBLING TOGETHER ABOUT THE INHOSPITALITY OF THEIR HOST
HE KEPT HIS WORD
I AM TOO GRAVE TO MINISTER TO HIS AMUSEMENTS AND ENTER INTO HIS INFANTILE SPORTS AS A NURSE OR A MOTHER OUGHT TO DO AND OFTEN HIS BURSTS OF GLEEFUL MERRIMENT TROUBLE AND ALARM ME
I HAD MYSELF HELD THE CONTRARY OPINION AT ONE TIME BUT I NOW BELIEVED THAT YOU MUTUALLY CORRUPTED EACH OTHER
TELL ME RESUMED SHE ON WHAT GROUNDS YOU BELIEVE THESE THINGS AGAINST ME
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL TAKE MRS MARKHAM SAID HE
DO YOU DENY THAT HE IS AN UPRIGHT HONOURABLE MAN NO DO YOU DENY THAT HE IS SENSIBLE SOBER RESPECTABLE NO
IT SEEMED TO SQUEEZE THE BLOOD OUT OF MY HEART
FOR THEM SHE UTTERLY DISREGARDS
RECEIVE COLDLY AND DISPASSIONATELY EVERY ATTENTION TILL YOU HAVE ASCERTAINED AND DULY CONSIDERED THE WORTH OF THE ASPIRANT
I ALWAYS LOOK AFTER THE BREWING MYSELF AS WELL AS THE CHEESE AND THE BUTTER--I LIKE TO HAVE THINGS WELL DONE WHILE WE'RE ABOUT IT QUITE RIGHT MRS MARKHAM BUT THEN MR MILLWARD YOU DON'T THINK IT WRONG TO TAKE A LITTLE WINE NOW AND THEN--OR A LITTLE SPIRITS EITHER SAID MY MOTHER AS SHE HANDED A SMOKING TUMBLER OF GIN-AND-WATER TO MRS WILSON WHO AFFIRMED THAT WINE SAT HEAVY ON HER STOMACH AND WHOSE SON ROBERT WAS AT THAT MOMENT HELPING HIMSELF TO A PRETTY STIFF GLASS OF THE SAME
BUT YOU PARDON THIS OFFENCE ON CONDITION THAT YOU NEVER REPEAT IT AND MAY I COME TO SEE YOU NOW AND THEN PERHAPS--OCCASIONALLY
THE QUESTION WHAT IF I SHOULD FIND HIM LYING STILL ON THE DAMP EARTH FAIRLY DYING OF COLD AND EXHAUSTION--OR ALREADY STARK AND CHILL
BUT SOMEHOW LOWBOROUGH HAD NOT THE GIFT OF MODERATION
YOU NEED NOT FEAR TO TRUST ME
IT'S ALICE
IT WAS A SPLENDID MORNING ABOUT THE CLOSE OF JUNE
BUT GILBERT CAN YOU REALLY DERIVE NO CONSOLATION FROM THE THOUGHT THAT WE MAY MEET TOGETHER WHERE THERE IS NO MORE PAIN AND SORROW NO MORE STRIVING AGAINST SIN AND STRUGGLING OF THE SPIRIT AGAINST THE FLESH
BUT NOW YOU HAVE LEFT ME NOTHING TO HOPE MY CASE IS QUITE DESPERATE IS IT
THE WORLD'S OPINION AND THE FEELINGS OF MY FRIENDS MUST BE ALIKE UNHEEDED HERE AT LEAST--ALIKE UNABLE TO DETER ME FROM MY DUTY
AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED AND ADMITTED MR HARGRAVE JUST A LITTLE FLUSHED HIS DARK EYES SPARKLING WITH UNWONTED VIVACITY
HOW THREATENING THOSE CLOUDS LOOK CONTINUED HE TURNING TOWARDS THE WINDOW
IT WAS MAKING YOU OLD AND UGLY BEFORE YOUR TIME AND HAD ALREADY MADE HIS FIRESIDE AS COMFORTLESS AS A CONVENT CELL
NOW ARE YOU GOING SAID SHE
YOU'LL NEVER EFFECT ANY GOOD BY THAT
BUT THE YOUNG LADY WHO HAD BEEN BUSILY PATTING THE SNOW WITH HER FOOT DURING OUR SHORT SOTTO-VOCE COLLOQUY VERY OPPORTUNELY CAME TO MY ASSISTANCE BY PINCHING HER COMPANION'S ARM AND WHISPERING A SUGGESTION THAT HIS FRIEND SHOULD BE INVITED TO STEP INTO THE CARRIAGE AND GO WITH THEM
NOTHING REPLIED HE
IT'S MERE BOY'S TALK THAT
IT'S ONLY MY ROUGH WAY OF TALKING
I SHOULD NOT GRUMBLE AT YOUR STAYING WHOLE MONTHS AWAY--IF YOU CAN BE HAPPY SO LONG WITHOUT ME--PROVIDED I KNEW YOU WERE SAFE
DURING THAT TIME SHE NEVER APPEARED AT CHURCH AND I NEVER WENT NEAR THE HOUSE
WHO WAS IT SAID IT IS NOT THE WILL OF YOUR FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN THAT ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONES SHOULD PERISH CHAPTER XLI MARCH 20TH.--HAVING NOW GOT RID OF MR HUNTINGDON FOR A SEASON MY SPIRITS BEGIN TO REVIVE
NOW THAT YOU HAVE HIM YOU WOULD NOT EXCHANGE HIM FOR ANOTHER
BUT MEANTIME LOWBOROUGH BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH OUR CHARMING FRIEND MISS WILMOT--THROUGH THE INTERVENTION OF HIS GOOD ANGEL NO DOUBT HE WOULD TELL YOU THOUGH HE DID NOT DARE TO FIX HIS HOPES ON ONE SO COURTED AND ADMIRED TILL AFTER THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO CLOSER CONTACT HERE AT STANINGLEY AND SHE IN THE ABSENCE OF HER OTHER ADMIRERS INDUBITABLY COURTED HIS NOTICE AND HELD OUT EVERY ENCOURAGEMENT TO HIS TIMID ADVANCES
FOR I'LL PROMISE NEVER--THAT IS I'LL PROMISE TO THINK TWICE BEFORE I TAKE ANY IMPORTANT STEP YOU SERIOUSLY DISAPPROVE OF SO SAYING I LIGHTED MY CANDLE AND WENT TO BED CONSIDERABLY QUENCHED IN SPIRIT
SHE DOES MIND IT
AND WITH INTENSE AND EAGER INTEREST I DEVOURED THE REMAINDER OF ITS CONTENTS
IT WAS NEVER MY CUSTOM TO TALK ABOUT MRS GRAHAM EITHER TO HER OR ANY ONE ELSE
AND SHE MAY CONTINUE TO THINK SO TILL WE MEET AGAIN--IF EVER THAT SHOULD BE
NO THANK YOU I REPLIED
BUT WHILE I GAZED I THOUGHT UPON THE BOOK AND WONDERED HOW IT WAS TO BE PRESENTED
HE WAS NOT GOING TO BE THE TALK OF ALL THE OLD GOSSIPS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
YOU LITTLE EXORBITANT TYRANT WILL NOT THAT BE QUIET A MOMENT WILL YOU ARTHUR SAID I AND LISTEN TO ME--AND DON'T THINK I'M IN A JEALOUS FURY
BUT I HAD NOT WANDERED FAR BEFORE MY SOLITUDE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE ONLY PERSON THAT COULD HAVE DISTURBED MY MUSINGS AT THAT MOMENT WITHOUT BEING LOOKED UPON AS AN UNWELCOME INTRUDER
FOR IT SEEMS AS IF LIFE AND HOPE MUST CEASE TOGETHER
BUT I WAS NOT POLITE ENOUGH TO LET IT PASS
INTENSE ANXIETY DARKENED MY SIGHT
I TOLD HIM IT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY NOT TO SAY RIDICULOUS AT THE PRESENT SEASON
MY SECOND WAS TO BRING HIM A BOOK WHICH KNOWING HIS MOTHER'S PARTICULARITY I HAD CAREFULLY SELECTED AND WHICH I SUBMITTED FOR HER APPROBATION BEFORE PRESENTING IT TO HIM
I GUESS SHE THOUGHT SUCH A HANDSOME YOUNG HUSBAND WAS WORTH ALL AT EVER SHE HAD AND HE MIGHT TAKE IT AND WELCOME BUT I LAY SHE'LL RUE HER BARGAIN AFORE LONG
AND YOU PROMISED COME COME HELEN DON'T BEGIN WITH THAT NONSENSE NOW
IF I BOAST OF THESE THINGS NOW I SHALL HAVE TO BLUSH HEREAFTER
MISS WILMOT OBSERVES IT TOO AND TRIUMPHANTLY ASCRIBES IT TO HER OWN SUPERIOR CHARMS AND BLANDISHMENTS
FOR ALL THESE TWO HOURS I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF YOU AND WANTING TO CATCH YOUR EYE AND YOU WERE SO ABSORBED IN YOUR DEVOTIONS THAT YOU HAD NOT EVEN A GLANCE TO SPARE FOR ME--I DECLARE IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE JEALOUS OF ONE'S MAKER--WHICH IS VERY WRONG YOU KNOW
BRANWELL HAS BEEN A TUTOR AT THORPE GREEN AND HAD MUCH TRIBULATION AND ILL-HEALTH
THE TRUTH IS LAWRENCE SAID I I HAVE NOT ACTED QUITE CORRECTLY TOWARDS YOU OF LATE--ESPECIALLY ON THIS LAST OCCASION
FROM THESE DETAILS YOU MAY FORM YOUR OWN JUDGMENT OF THE STATE OF MY PATIENT AND OF MY OWN POSITION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
AND THIS MORNING HE FINISHED THE BUSINESS:--I THINK THE PETRIFACTION IS SO COMPLETELY EFFECTED AT LAST THAT NOTHING CAN MELT ME AGAIN
GRACIOUS MR MARKHAM ARE YOU GOING TO FAINT
FOR I KEEP HIM IN TOO GOOD ORDER FOR THAT ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T ARROGATE TOO MUCH OF THE CREDIT TO YOURSELF
POOR CHILD SHE LITTLE KNOWS THE WORLD SHE LIVES IN
THERE MAY BE A FEW MORTGAGES ON THE REST--A FEW TRIFLING DEBTS AND INCUMBRANCES HERE AND THERE BUT NOTHING TO SPEAK OF
AND REGARDLESS OF THE SHRILL VOICE IN MY EAR CALLING UPON ME TO WAIT A MOMENT I PURSUED THE EVEN TENOR OF MY WAY
INDEPENDENTLY OF THE MORAL EVIL OF BASING OUR HOPES UPON THE DEATH OF ANOTHER WHO IF UNFIT FOR THIS WORLD WAS AT LEAST NO LESS SO FOR THE NEXT AND WHOSE AMELIORATION WOULD THUS BECOME OUR BANE AND HIS GREATEST TRANSGRESSION OUR GREATEST BENEFIT,--SHE MAINTAINED IT TO BE MADNESS
DO WAIT AWHILE AND SEE
I AM NO MARTYR TO IT NOW AS YOU CAN BEAR ME WITNESS
I'VE BEEN TO CALL ON THE WILSONS
SOMEWHAT RELUCTANTLY HE ASCENDED THE STEPS AND ADVANCED A PACE OR TWO INTO THE HALL
BUT HAVE PATIENCE LOVE
ELIZA'S FIGURE WAS AT ONCE SLIGHT AND PLUMP HER FACE SMALL AND NEARLY AS ROUND AS MY SISTER'S,--COMPLEXION SOMETHING SIMILAR TO HERS BUT MORE DELICATE AND LESS DECIDEDLY BLOOMING,--NOSE RETROUSSE,--FEATURES GENERALLY IRREGULAR
FOR SINCE HE AND I ARE ONE I SO IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH HIM THAT I FEEL HIS DEGRADATION HIS FAILINGS AND TRANSGRESSIONS AS MY OWN
IF I DO YOU WILL REPEAT THE OFFENCE I SWEAR BY DON'T SWEAR
MR HUNTINGDON WAS PRESENT BUT AS I THOUGHT ASLEEP ON THE SOFA BEHIND ME
EARLY WE ROSE SWIFTLY AND QUIETLY DRESSED SLOWLY AND STEALTHILY DESCENDED TO THE HALL WHERE BENSON STOOD READY WITH A LIGHT TO OPEN THE DOOR AND FASTEN IT AFTER US
HER EFFORTS WERE NOT UNNOTICED BY HIM
AND ONCE OR TWICE WHEN HE WAS SICK I HAVE OBLIGED THE POOR CHILD TO SWALLOW A LITTLE WINE-AND-WATER WITHOUT THE TARTAR-EMETIC BY WAY OF MEDICINE
GILBERT WHY ARE YOU NOT IN BED--YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO GO CONFOUND IT
HE KNOWS HE HAS REJECTED THE CLERGYMAN'S WELL-MEANT ADMONITIONS WITH SCOFFING LEVITY AT OTHER TIMES AND CANNOT DREAM OF TURNING TO HIM FOR CONSOLATION NOW
BUT NOTHING CAN BE FURTHER FROM MY PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE THAN SUCH CRIMINAL WEAKNESS AS THAT WELL BUT YOU WILL TREAT HIM LIKE A GIRL--YOU'LL SPOIL HIS SPIRIT AND MAKE A MERE MISS NANCY OF HIM--YOU WILL INDEED MRS GRAHAM WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK
AND SINCE HE HAD DEPRIVED ME OF EVERY OTHER OCCUPATION HE MIGHT SURELY LEAVE ME THAT
BUT IT IS NOT SO
THEREFORE MY DEAREST GIRL SINCE I AM SATISFIED WHY SHOULD YOU OBJECT--ON MY ACCOUNT AT LEAST BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH MR BOARHAM IT IS ON MY OWN ACCOUNT I PRINCIPALLY OBJECT
WHAT DID HE THINK
I THOUGHT I WAS FULLY COMPETENT TO THE TASK OF TEACHING HIM MYSELF--FOR SOME YEARS TO COME AT LEAST
BUT HANG IT!--THAT'S NOT MY FAULT WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF IT THEN
BUT TELL ME SHOULD YOU WISH YOUR SONS TO BE LIKE MR HUNTINGDON--OR EVEN LIKE YOURSELF HANG IT
WHY NOT OH WELL WAS MY ONLY AUDIBLE REPLY
AND FOR MILICENT'S SAKE I DO NOT WISH TO QUARREL WITH HIM
SHORTLY AFTER LORD LOWBOROUGH ENTERED AND THEN MR BOARHAM WHO SEEMED QUITE WILLING TO FORGET AND FORGIVE MY FORMER CONDUCT AND TO HOPE THAT A LITTLE CONCILIATION AND STEADY PERSEVERANCE ON HIS PART MIGHT YET SUCCEED IN BRINGING ME TO REASON
AND YOU ABOVE THEM ALL
I OBSERVED IT TO--TO THAT INFERNAL DEMON HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
GIVE THAT BOOK TO ME SAID ARTHUR IN NO VERY COURTEOUS TONE
WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THIS HEAVENLY SCENE--PERHAPS REVELLING WITH HIS BOON COMPANIONS PERHAPS--GOD HELP ME IT IS TOO--TOO MUCH
BUT WHEN HE DID MEET ME THERE WAS LESS OF PRIDE AND MORE OF TOUCHING MELANCHOLY IN HIS MANNER THAN BEFORE
THERE YOU MAY GO NOW
BUT BEFORE ANYTHING MORE COULD BE SAID ON EITHER SIDE ESTHER AND ARTHUR RE-ENTERED THE ROOM
BUT HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO ANNABELLA AND I OF COURSE LEFT ALL THE LAUGHTER AND ALL THE BADINAGE TO HER AND AFFECTING THE UTMOST INDIFFERENCE TO WHATEVER PASSED BETWEEN THEM WALKED ALONG A FEW PACES APART AND LOOKING EVERY WAY BUT THEIRS WHILE MY AUNT AND MILICENT WENT BEFORE LINKED ARM IN ARM AND GRAVELY DISCOURSING TOGETHER
IT WAS TO GET YOU AWAY FROM THAT SCOUNDRELLY OLD PROFLIGATE YONDER WHO IS LOOKING AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO CHALLENGE ME FOR THE AFFRONT I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU SAID I
CHAPTER XXXIII SEVENTH.--YES I WILL HOPE
PERHAPS TOO HE THOUGHT OF ME
SOME IT IS TRUE LEAVING A DEEPER AND MORE PLEASING IMPRESSION THAN OTHERS BUT THESE EMBITTERED BY THE RECOLLECTION THAT MY EMOTIONS HAD NOT BEEN SHARED BY MY COMPANION BUT THAT ON THE CONTRARY WHEN I HAD EXPRESSED A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN ANYTHING THAT I SAW OR DESIRED TO SEE IT HAD BEEN DISPLEASING TO HIM INASMUCH AS IT PROVED THAT I COULD TAKE DELIGHT IN ANYTHING DISCONNECTED WITH HIMSELF
NO YOU'LL LOOK COMPLACENTLY ON AND NOT SO MUCH AS DIP THE TIP OF YOUR FINGER IN WATER TO COOL MY TONGUE IF SO IT WILL BE BECAUSE OF THE GREAT GULF OVER WHICH I CANNOT PASS
AND HER GENTLE COUSIN MILICENT HARGRAVE WHO HAD TAKEN A VIOLENT FANCY TO ME MISTAKING ME FOR SOMETHING VASTLY BETTER THAN I WAS
HER PALE LIPS QUIVERED AND HER FINGERS TREMBLED WITH AGITATION AS SHE NERVOUSLY ENTWINED THEM IN THE HAIR-CHAIN TO WHICH WAS APPENDED HER SMALL GOLD WATCH--THE ONLY THING OF VALUE SHE HAD PERMITTED HERSELF TO KEEP
YES SIR
ONLY LET US GET SHUT OF THIS WICKED HOUSE AND WE'LL DO RIGHT ENOUGH YOU'LL SEE SO THINK I WAS MY ANSWER
HAVE YOU ANY OBJECTION TO TAKE MY HAND OR YOU'D RATHER NOT IT TREMBLED THROUGH WEAKNESS AS HE HELD IT OUT AND DROPPED BEFORE I HAD TIME TO CATCH IT AND GIVE IT A HEARTY SQUEEZE WHICH HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO RETURN
THAT STRANGE WHIM STILL INCREASES AS HIS STRENGTH DECLINES--THE FANCY TO HAVE ME ALWAYS BY HIS SIDE
HIS FOREHEAD GLISTENED WITH THE DEWS OF AGONY
WHY SHOULD YOU SIGH AND GROAN AND I BE MADE UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE AN OLD GENTLEMAN IN SHIRE A PERFECT STRANGER TO US BOTH HAS THOUGHT PROPER TO DRINK HIMSELF TO DEATH
AND AT LAST I CHANCED TO OVERHEAR A PART OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN YOU AND HER THAT MADE ME THINK I HAD A RIGHT TO HATE YOU AND HOW CAME YOU TO KNOW THAT I WAS HER BROTHER ASKED HE IN SOME ANXIETY
BUT SHE IS STILL HEART-WHOLE AND UNENGAGED
MY LAST VISIT HAD BEEN TO RETURN THE BOOK SHE HAD LENT ME
BUT WE KNOW NOT THAT IT WILL BE SO;--AND I DO KNOW THAT TO REGRET THE EXCHANGE OF EARTHLY PLEASURES FOR THE JOYS OF HEAVEN IS AS IF THE GROVELLING CATERPILLAR SHOULD LAMENT THAT IT MUST ONE DAY QUIT THE NIBBLED LEAF TO SOAR ALOFT AND FLUTTER THROUGH THE AIR ROVING AT WILL FROM FLOWER TO FLOWER SIPPING SWEET HONEY FROM THEIR CUPS OR BASKING IN THEIR SUNNY PETALS
I AM NOT INCAPABLE OF SEEING FOR MYSELF AH YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS CRIED SHE SMILING WITH A GLEAM OF HOPE
BUT ADDED HE I WOULD NOT DESIRE YOU TO FOLLOW OUT MY SIMILE TOO CLOSELY--IN WITNESS WHEREOF I FINISH MY GLASS AND TAKE ANOTHER I HOPE MR LAWRENCE SAID MY MOTHER PUSHING THE BOTTLE TOWARDS HIM
AND THEN I OBSERVED SHE SOUGHT THE EYE OF RICHARD WILSON WHO SAT OVER AGAINST HER
IN A LITTLE WHILE MILICENT ANNOUNCED IT HER INTENTION TO REPAIR TO THE NURSERY AND ASKED IF I WOULD ACCOMPANY HER
SHORTLY AFTER HE RELAPSED INTO A KIND OF DOZE BUT NOW HE GROANS AGAIN
AND IF I HAD HEARD YOU LONG AGO--OH GOD
IT'S ALWAYS SO--IF THERE'S ANYTHING PARTICULARLY NICE AT TABLE MAMMA WINKS AND NODS AT ME TO ABSTAIN FROM IT AND IF I DON'T ATTEND TO THAT SHE WHISPERS DON'T EAT SO MUCH OF THAT ROSE
MY FATHER HAS ENTIRELY GIVEN ME UP TO THEIR CARE
I SHALL SLEEP WELL--IF I CAN NOTWITHSTANDING THIS RESOLUTION I FOUND MY BED SO INTOLERABLE THAT BEFORE TWO O'CLOCK I ROSE AND LIGHTING MY CANDLE BY THE RUSHLIGHT THAT WAS STILL BURNING I GOT MY DESK AND SAT DOWN IN MY DRESSING-GOWN TO RECOUNT THE EVENTS OF THE PAST EVENING
THE HALF-FROZEN DEW LAY THICK ON THE GRASS THE SWALLOWS WERE TWITTERING ROUND ME THE ROOKS CAWING AND COWS LOWING IN THE DISTANCE
AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED I HAVE SACRIFICED MY OWN FEELINGS AND ALL THE LITTLE EARTHLY COMFORT THAT WAS LEFT ME TO NO PURPOSE
I WAS IN AN AGONY OF MINGLED LOVE HOPE DELIGHT UNCERTAINTY AND SUSPENSE
I DON'T LIKE MRS HARGRAVE
THE FORMER GLANCED AT WALTER'S FLUSHED EXCITED COUNTENANCE AND THEN AT MINE--A LITTLE FLUSHED AND EXCITED TOO I DARESAY THOUGH FROM FAR DIFFERENT CAUSES
AND WHEN YOU WRITE SAID I WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ASK HER IF I MAY BE PERMITTED TO ENLIGHTEN MY MOTHER AND SISTER ON HER REAL HISTORY AND CIRCUMSTANCE JUST SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY TO MAKE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SENSIBLE OF THE SHAMEFUL INJUSTICE THEY HAVE DONE HER
MR HUNTINGDON REMARKED THE CIRCUMSTANCE
SINCE THAT HE HAS BEEN FRIENDLY AND CIVIL BUT NOTHING MORE--IN MY PRESENCE AT LEAST NOR I THINK AT ANY OTHER TIME
I KNOW IT'S VERY RUDE BUT HA HA HA!--DID YOU THINK TO MARRY HER YOURSELF
IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME HELEN THAT MY GOOD ANGEL BROUGHT ME INTO CONJUNCTION WITH YOU
LET US FORGET ALL UNPLEASANT WORDS ON BOTH SIDES AS WELL AS DEEDS AND CONSIGN TO OBLIVION EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE CAUSE TO REGRET
AND THOUGH I ACKNOWLEDGE I AM NOT SO RICH AS I MIGHT BE--OR HAVE BEEN--STILL I THINK WE COULD MANAGE PRETTY COMFORTABLY ON WHAT'S LEFT
WHEN PRESUMING UPON MY UNSUSPECTING KINDNESS HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT VENTURE TO OVERSTEP THE BOUNDS OF DECENT MODERATION AND PROPRIETY THAT HAD SO LONG RESTRAINED HIM
I WAS GLAD WHEN I LEARNT THAT MILICENT WAS SO NEAR US
AT DINNER I NARROWLY OBSERVED BOTH HER AND ARTHUR AND SAW NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY IN THE CONDUCT OF EITHER NOTHING CALCULATED TO EXCITE SUSPICION EXCEPT IN DISTRUSTFUL MINDS WHICH MINE WAS NOT AND THEREFORE I WOULD NOT SUSPECT
HE DROPPED IT HOWEVER IN HIS START OF INDIGNANT SURPRISE AS I ADVANCED INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD BEFORE HIM ON THE RUG
A GIRL'S AFFECTIONS SHOULD NEVER BE WON UNSOUGHT
I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T SEND FOR YOU
BUT ARTHUR IS SELFISH
IT HAS THE SAME DETERMINED DIDACTIC TONE WHICH PERVADES THE BOOK ITSELF THE SAME NARROWNESS OF VIEW AND INFLATION OF EXPRESSION AN INFLATION WHICH IS REALLY DUE NOT TO ANY PERSONAL EGOTISM IN THE WRITER BUT RATHER TO THAT VERY GENTLENESS AND INEXPERIENCE WHICH MUST YET NERVE ITSELF UNDER THE STIMULUS OF RELIGION TO ITS DISAGREEABLE AND REPULSIVE TASK
ALAS
THEY DON'T REQUIRE SNUFFING SAID I
AS FOR THE OWNER OF THAT FACE I CANNOT GET HIM OUT OF MY MIND--AND INDEED I NEVER TRY
THEY CAN'T TAKE HALF A BOTTLE WITHOUT BEING AFFECTED SOME WAY
YET LET ME REMEMBER IT IS NOT I THAT AM GUILTY
WHAT OTHER REQUISITION HAVE YOU TO MAKE
THE TRUTH IS ARTHUR I SAID AT LAST YOU ARE WEARY OF MY COMPANY AND DETERMINED NOT TO HAVE ME WITH YOU
NO SHE WAS WITH HER AUNT IN SHIRE BUT WAS EXPECTED TO RETURN BEFORE CHRISTMAS
I AM CERTAIN I NEVER SHALL."--BUT I TOLD HER I KNEW BETTER SOME ROMANTIC YOUNG WIDOW I SUPPOSE SAID I COME THERE TO END HER DAYS IN SOLITUDE AND MOURN IN SECRET FOR THE DEAR DEPARTED--BUT IT WON'T LAST LONG NO I THINK NOT OBSERVED ROSE
AND IF AN ACCIDENT HAPPENS--WHY THAT'LL BE ALL RIGHT TOO I DARESAY TO A DESPERATE FELLOW LIKE YOU
AND WHATEVER WAS UNUSUAL IN MY LOOK OR MANNER WAS GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE TRIFLING INDISPOSITION THAT HAD OCCASIONED MY EARLY RETIREMENT LAST NIGHT
BUT HE HAD NO NEAR RELATIONS OF HIS OWN--NONE BUT A NEPHEW HE'D QUARRELLED WITH
WILL YOU PROMISE NOT TO COME?--IF YOU WON'T AND IF YOU DO COME HERE AGAIN YOU WILL DRIVE ME AWAY BEFORE I KNOW WHERE TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE OF REFUGE--OR HOW TO SEEK IT HELEN SAID I TURNING IMPATIENTLY TOWARDS HER I CANNOT DISCUSS THE MATTER OF ETERNAL SEPARATION CALMLY AND DISPASSIONATELY AS YOU CAN DO
HE SMILED BUT NOT INSULTINGLY
AFTER BREAKFAST DETERMINED TO PASS AS LITTLE OF THE DAY AS POSSIBLE IN COMPANY WITH LADY LOWBOROUGH I QUIETLY STOLE AWAY FROM THE COMPANY AND RETIRED TO THE LIBRARY
I WONDER WHAT I SHALL DO WITHOUT HIM
AND THEN WITH A CARELESS HUMPH
IT WAS ONLY THIS MORNING WHILE I PURSUED MY USUAL EMPLOYMENT HE WAS SITTING AT MY FEET QUIETLY PLAYING WITH THE SHREDS OF CANVAS I HAD THROWN UPON THE CARPET
AND SHE REPAID ME WITH ONE OF HER SOFTEST SMILES AND MOST BEWITCHING GLANCES
AT LENGTH IT WAS OVER
I HAVE HAD EIGHT WEEKS EXPERIENCE OF MATRIMONY
YOU SHOULD HAVE COME TO ME AFTER ALL SAID SHE AND HEARD WHAT I HAD TO SAY IN MY OWN JUSTIFICATION
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT THEN SIR I FEAR YOU MUST BE VERY MUCH WORSE THAN YOU SHOULD BE IF I A MERE ORDINARY MORTAL AM BY YOUR OWN CONFESSION SO VASTLY YOUR SUPERIOR
AND AUNT MAXWELL IS NEVER GOING TO LEAVE OFF HERS PERSISTED THE NAUGHTY BOY
HER FEELINGS HAD BEEN WROUGHT TO A PITCH THAT RENDERED IT NECESSARY TO SEEK RELIEF IN TEARS
AND KEEP UP A GOOD FIRE
THE QUESTION STARTLED HER A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH
SOON AFTER BREAKFAST ALL THE GENTLEMEN SAVE ONE WITH BOYISH EAGERNESS SET OUT ON THEIR EXPEDITION AGAINST THE HAPLESS PARTRIDGES
I HAVE FOUND RELIEF IN DESCRIBING THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE DESTROYED MY PEACE AS WELL AS THE LITTLE TRIVIAL DETAILS ATTENDANT UPON THEIR DISCOVERY
I SUSPECTED AT FIRST THAT SHE WAS DESIROUS OF THROWING COLD WATER ON THIS GROWING INTIMACY--TO QUENCH AS IT WERE THE KINDLING FLAME OF OUR FRIENDSHIP--BUT DISCOVERING AT LENGTH IN SPITE OF HER PREJUDICE AGAINST ME THAT I WAS PERFECTLY HARMLESS AND EVEN WELL-INTENTIONED AND THAT BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY DOG HER SON DERIVED A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE FROM THE ACQUAINTANCE THAT HE WOULD NOT OTHERWISE HAVE KNOWN SHE CEASED TO OBJECT AND EVEN WELCOMED MY COMING WITH A SMILE
BUT IT COULD NOT HARM YOU TO TELL IT I PERSISTED
BUT NONE THE WORSE FOR THAT UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES
I FIRST ATTEMPTED TO KEEP HIM ALWAYS WITH ME OR IN THE NURSERY AND GAVE RACHEL PARTICULAR INJUNCTIONS NEVER TO LET HIM COME DOWN TO DESSERT AS LONG AS THESE GENTLEMEN STAYED
AFTER LUNCH I GOT MY DRAWING AND FROM DINNER TILL BED-TIME I READ
WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU MEAN ELIZA OH DON'T ASK ME
I CAME HERE TO BID FAREWELL TO MRS HUNTINGDON AND TELL HER I MUST GO TO-MORROW HUMPH
WE HAD BEEN TOO MUCH ABSORBED IN OUR CONVERSATION TO OBSERVE HIS KNOCK
I'M AN ENGLISHWOMAN--AND I DON'T SEE WHY ANY ONE SHOULD DOUBT IT--AND I WAS BORN IN THE COUNTRY NEITHER IN THE EXTREME NORTH NOR SOUTH OF OUR HAPPY ISLE
WHILE MY LITTLE NEIGHBOUR WAS EXCHANGING A FEW WORDS WITH MISS WILSON I ROSE AND CANNILY SLIPPED AWAY
I BELIEVE TOO THAT HE SOON LEARNED TO CONTEMPLATE WITH SECRET AMAZEMENT HIS FORMER PREDILECTION AND TO CONGRATULATE HIMSELF ON THE LUCKY ESCAPE HE HAD MADE
MY ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT HE SPENDS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE OF HIS TIME AT HOME AND DURING THE MONTHS HE PASSES IN LONDON OR ELSEWHERE I HAVE A CHANCE OF RECOVERING THE GROUND I HAD LOST AND OVERCOMING WITH GOOD THE EVIL HE HAS WROUGHT BY HIS WILFUL MISMANAGEMENT
IF I TRY SAID HIS AFFLICTED WIFE TO DIVERT HIM FROM THESE THINGS--TO RAISE HIS THOUGHTS TO HIGHER THEMES IT IS NO BETTER:--"WORSE AND WORSE HE GROANS
ON WINTER EVENINGS WHEN ARTHUR IS IN BED AND I AM SITTING THERE ALONE HEARING THE BLEAK WIND MOANING ROUND ME AND HOWLING THROUGH THE RUINOUS OLD CHAMBERS NO BOOKS OR OCCUPATIONS CAN REPRESS THE DISMAL THOUGHTS AND APPREHENSIONS THAT COME CROWDING IN--BUT IT IS FOLLY TO GIVE WAY TO SUCH WEAKNESS I KNOW
AND THEN I TAKE LITTLE PAINS TO SUPPRESS MY SCORN AND DISGUST
THAT LOWBOROUGH'S FAIRLY BESOTTED
TO-DAY IS THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER
YOU SHOULD HATE--DESPISE--PITY--ANYTHING BUT LOVE HIM--WERE NOT THOSE YOUR WORDS YES
A FEW MORE MOVES AND I WAS INEXTRICABLY ENTANGLED IN THE SNARE OF MY ANTAGONIST
THAT'S ALL NONSENSE MY DEAR
MISS MILLWARD WAS THERE IT IS TRUE BUT SHE OF COURSE WOULD BE LITTLE BETTER THAN A NONENTITY
GIVE ME THE CHILD SHE SAID IN A VOICE SCARCE LOUDER THAN A WHISPER BUT WITH A TONE OF STARTLING VEHEMENCE AND SEIZING THE BOY SHE SNATCHED HIM FROM ME AS IF SOME DIRE CONTAMINATION WERE IN MY TOUCH AND THEN STOOD WITH ONE HAND FIRMLY CLASPING HIS THE OTHER ON HIS SHOULDER FIXING UPON ME HER LARGE LUMINOUS DARK EYES--PALE BREATHLESS QUIVERING WITH AGITATION
MY FEARS INCREASED BUT NOT YET THOROUGHLY CONFIRMED
I HAVE A SECOND-HAND PIANO AND A TOLERABLY WELL-STOCKED BOOKCASE IN MY PARLOUR
AND I AM MISERABLE TOO
BUT IN DUTY TO MY SON I MUST SUBMIT NO LONGER
AND NOTHING THAT I OR YOU CAN SAY CAN EVER RETRIEVE IT
ISN'T HUNTINGDON HE CONTINUED AS GREAT A REPROBATE AS EVER WAS D--D HIS LADY WILL NOT HEAR HIM CENSURED WITH IMPUNITY REPLIED MR HARGRAVE COMING FORWARD
I DESERVED NONE AND I WANTED NONE
BUT I TOLD HIM I DISLIKED SUCH CONDUCT AND HE PROMISED ME NOT TO REPEAT IT I THOUGHT HE LOOKED RATHER SUBDUED THIS MORNING SHE CONTINUED
FOR I CAN'T DO WITH BEING BOTHERED WELL SAID I I KNOW SOMEBODY THAT WILL SUIT YOU TO A TEE IF YOU DON'T CARE FOR MONEY AND THAT'S HARGRAVE'S SISTER MILICENT HE DESIRED TO BE INTRODUCED TO HER FORTHWITH FOR HE SAID HE HAD PLENTY OF THE NEEDFUL HIMSELF OR SHOULD HAVE WHEN HIS OLD GOVERNOR CHOSE TO QUIT THE STAGE
NOW I WOULD HAVE BOTH SO TO BENEFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS AND THE PRECEPTS OF A HIGHER AUTHORITY THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW BEFOREHAND TO REFUSE THE EVIL AND CHOOSE THE GOOD AND REQUIRE NO EXPERIMENTAL PROOFS TO TEACH THEM THE EVIL OF TRANSGRESSION
I'LL TELL YOU MR HATTERSLEY SAID I
I WONDER WHAT THE DEUCE THE LAD MEANS BY COMING SO OFTEN HE WOULD SAY,--'CAN YOU TELL HELEN?--HEY
I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN MY ASSAULT UPON FREDERICK LAWRENCE
HE'S ONLY SIX-AND-TWENTY YET HE MAY I ANSWERED HE WILL HE WILL REPEATED SHE
DARE I HOPE THIS WILL CONTINUE
I LEFT HIM AT IT WHEN I WENT TO THE CONTINENT
WE HOPE HE WILL BE BETTER AND DO BETTER IN FUTURE AND AT THE END OF THE PAPER SHE SAYS SADLY FORECASTING THE COMING YEARS I FOR MY PART CANNOT WELL BE FLATTER OR OLDER IN MIND THAN I AM NOW THIS IS THE LANGUAGE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND ANXIETY
DO NOT BE ALARMED SAID HE
AND IF YOU WISH ME TO FEEL KINDLY TOWARDS YOU IT IS DEEDS NOT WORDS WHICH MUST PURCHASE MY AFFECTION AND ESTEEM HIS SOLE REPLY TO THIS WAS A SLIGHT GRIMACE AND A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SHRUG
OF COURSE NOT I ANSWERED
IT'S HER DOING MILICENT FLEW TO THANK ME OVERFLOWING WITH GRATITUDE
YOU LOOK LIKE A GHOST HE CONTINUED SURVEYING ME BY THE LIGHT OF HIS CANDLE
AFTER ALL THE WEAR AND TEAR THAT I'VE HAD WHEN I COME HOME SICK AND WEARY LONGING FOR COMFORT AND EXPECTING TO FIND ATTENTION AND KINDNESS AT LEAST FROM MY WIFE SHE CALMLY ASKS WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME THERE IS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH YOU RETURNED I EXCEPT WHAT YOU HAVE WILFULLY BROUGHT UPON YOURSELF AGAINST MY EARNEST EXHORTATION AND ENTREATY NOW HELEN SAID HE EMPHATICALLY HALF RISING FROM HIS RECUMBENT POSTURE IF YOU BOTHER ME WITH ANOTHER WORD I'LL RING THE BELL AND ORDER SIX BOTTLES OF WINE AND BY HEAVEN I'LL DRINK THEM DRY BEFORE I STIR FROM THIS PLACE I SAID NO MORE BUT SAT DOWN BEFORE THE TABLE AND DREW A BOOK TOWARDS ME
BUT I MUST SEE HIM FOR A MOMENT
AND WALTER TOO IS AS STERN AND COLD AND HAUGHTY AS IF HE HATED ME OUTRIGHT
YOU SHALL JUST HEAR NOW WHAT SHE TOLD US THE OTHER DAY--I TOLD HER I'D TELL YOU AND MY MOTHER FAVOURED THE COMPANY WITH A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THAT LADY'S MISTAKEN IDEAS AND CONDUCT REGARDING THE MATTER IN HAND CONCLUDING WITH NOW DON'T YOU THINK IT IS WRONG WRONG REPEATED THE VICAR WITH MORE THAN COMMON SOLEMNITY--'CRIMINAL I SHOULD SAY--CRIMINAL
INSTEAD OF YOUR USUAL COMPLEMENT OF ONE LUMP YOU HAVE PUT IN SIX HAVE I SO REPLIED THE PHILOSOPHER DIVING WITH HIS SPOON INTO THE CUP AND BRINGING UP SEVERAL HALF-DISSOLVED PIECES IN CONFIRMATION OF THE ASSERTION
I CAN TELL THIS BY THE AIR OF TENDER SADNESS PERVADING HIS LETTERS
THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE THERE CAME ANOTHER LETTER
I HOPE HE IS WELL
AND I CANNOT WONDER AT IT FOR YOU MUST BE HEARTILY SICK OF US ALL
TELL ME MY DEAR WHAT ARE YOUR OBJECTIONS TO HIM
NOW ROSE I'LL TELL YOU A PIECE OF NEWS--I HOPE YOU HAVE NOT HEARD IT BEFORE
AND SOON I HEARD HER STEP IN THE HALL
THEN YOU WILL LEAVE ME AGAIN ARTHUR SAID I
BUT I GREATLY PREFER KEEPING HIM UNDER MY OWN EYE
YOU SAY THERE IS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH YOU AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO GRIEVE YOU AND YET I NEVER SAW ANYONE SO ALTERED AS YOU WITHIN THESE LAST FEW DAYS
AND ALBEIT HE MADE SOME CLEVER REMARKS AND SOME EXCESSIVELY DROLL ONES I DO NOT THINK THE WHOLE WOULD APPEAR ANYTHING VERY PARTICULAR IF WRITTEN HERE WITHOUT THE ADVENTITIOUS AIDS OF LOOK AND TONE AND GESTURE AND THAT INEFFABLE BUT INDEFINITE CHARM WHICH CAST A HALO OVER ALL HE DID AND SAID AND WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE IT A DELIGHT TO LOOK IN HIS FACE AND HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS VOICE IF HE HAD BEEN TALKING POSITIVE NONSENSE--AND WHICH MOREOVER MADE ME FEEL SO BITTER AGAINST MY AUNT WHEN SHE PUT A STOP TO THIS ENJOYMENT BY COMING COMPOSEDLY FORWARD UNDER PRETENCE OF WISHING TO SEE THE DRAWINGS THAT SHE CARED AND KNEW NOTHING ABOUT AND WHILE MAKING BELIEVE TO EXAMINE THEM ADDRESSING HERSELF TO MR HUNTINGDON WITH ONE OF HER COLDEST AND MOST REPELLENT ASPECTS AND BEGINNING A SERIES OF THE MOST COMMON-PLACE AND FORMIDABLY FORMAL QUESTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS ON PURPOSE TO WREST HIS ATTENTION FROM ME--ON PURPOSE TO VEX ME AS I THOUGHT
AND THAT VEXES ME
I SHOULD HATE HIM--DESPISE HIM--PITY HIM--ANYTHING BUT LOVE HIM
BUT IT'S BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION HERE BENSON ENTERED WITH THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE
I MAY HAVE GONE TOO FAR
SHE HAS NO WILL BUT HIS AND IS ALWAYS CONTENTED AND HAPPY AS LONG AS HE IS ENJOYING HIMSELF IN THAT CASE SHE IS AS GREAT A FOOL AS HE IS
NOT ANY FOR ME I THANK YOU REPLIED HE
WARD
CHAPTER XLVI I FELT STRONGLY TEMPTED AT TIMES TO ENLIGHTEN MY MOTHER AND SISTER ON THE REAL CHARACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PERSECUTED TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL AND AT FIRST I GREATLY REGRETTED HAVING OMITTED TO ASK THAT LADY'S PERMISSION TO DO SO
AND YOU MUST TELL ME WHY THAT I MAY BEST KNOW HOW TO COMBAT HER OBJECTIONS
THE OLD BOXWOOD SWAN THAT SAT BESIDE THE SCRAPER HAD LOST ITS NECK AND HALF ITS BODY
IS IT ANGER AT POOR ME FOR TELLING SUCH A FIB
ON THAT AND EVERY SUBSEQUENT OCCASION HIS PRESENCE SERVED RATHER AS A CHECK UPON HIS HOST THAN AN INCITEMENT TO FURTHER ACTS OF INTEMPERANCE
COME HERE ARTHUR SAID THE LATTER EXTENDING HIS HAND TOWARDS HIM
FOR I THOUGHT HER ANNOYANCE WAS CHIEFLY AGAINST MYSELF
AND SINCE HE DECLARES THAT THE TASTE THE SMELL THE SIGHT OF ANY ONE OF THEM IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE HIM SICK I HAVE GIVEN UP TEASING HIM ABOUT THEM EXCEPT NOW AND THEN AS OBJECTS OF TERROR IN CASES OF MISBEHAVIOUR
AND SHE--ELIZA THAT IS--WILL BEG TO ACCOMPANY HIM AND IS SURE SHE CAN SUCCEED IN WHEEDLING SOMETHING OUT OF HER--YOU KNOW GILBERT SHE CAN DO ANYTHING
BUT SHE HAS A WAY OF TORMENTING HIM IN WHICH I AM A FELLOW-SUFFERER OR MIGHT BE IF I CHOSE TO REGARD MYSELF AS SUCH
BUT IN A MOMENT HE TURNED CALMLY ROUND AND SAID CARELESSLY
HE HAD TWO LADIES STAYING WITH HIM
SOMETIMES THE WORTHY GENTLEMAN WOULD REPROVE MY MOTHER FOR BEING OVER-INDULGENT TO HER SONS WITH A REFERENCE TO OLD ELI OR DAVID AND ABSALOM WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY GALLING TO HER FEELINGS
BUT YOU NEED NOT FEAR ME FOR I NOT ONLY SHOULD THINK IT WRONG TO MARRY A MAN THAT WAS DEFICIENT IN SENSE OR IN PRINCIPLE BUT I SHOULD NEVER BE TEMPTED TO DO IT
HAVE YOU GOT YOURS ALL IN YET NO
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH MA'AM I DON'T LIKE MASTER'S WAYS OF GOING ON WHAT DO YOU MEAN RACHEL
AND WHILE HE CONTINUES STILL TO CORRESPOND WITH LADY LOWBOROUGH AS I KNOW HE DOES
AND YET WHEN I CEASE WRITING I FIND MY HEAD ACHES TERRIBLY
WE SHALL ALL FOLLOW YOU SOON ENOUGH I WISH TO GOD I COULD TAKE YOU WITH ME NOW HE EXCLAIMED
SO I BEGGED ROSE TO GO WITH ME TO THE HALL AND INTRODUCE ME TO HER AT ONCE
HER PIETY CONSISTED IN AN OCCASIONAL HEAVING OF SIGHS AND UPLIFTING OF EYES TO THE CEILING AND THE UTTERANCE OF A FEW CANT PHRASES
SHE IS A SOBER CAUTIOUS WOMAN BUT SHE SO HATES HER MASTER AND SO LOVES HER MISTRESS AND HER NURSLING THAT AFTER SEVERAL EJACULATIONS A FEW FAINT OBJECTIONS AND MANY TEARS AND LAMENTATIONS THAT I SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO SUCH A PASS SHE APPLAUDED MY RESOLUTION AND CONSENTED TO AID ME WITH ALL HER MIGHT
HE HAS NOT POSITIVELY DISGRACED HIMSELF FOR UPWARDS OF A FORTNIGHT AND ALL THIS LAST WEEK HAS BEEN SO VERY MODERATE IN HIS INDULGENCE AT TABLE THAT I CAN PERCEIVE A MARKED DIFFERENCE IN HIS GENERAL TEMPER AND APPEARANCE
AND I MUST SEE HIM TO APOLOGISE FOR THE UNHAPPY DEED
BUT MY SPIRIT KINDLED WITHIN ME AND WHEN HE HAD DONE I REPLIED IF YOUR ACCUSATION WERE TRUE MR HUNTINGDON HOW DARE YOU BLAME ME SHE'S HIT IT BY JOVE CRIED HATTERSLEY REARING HIS GUN AGAINST THE WALL
HE SHOULD A BEEN WED AFORE TO A WIDOW LADY BUT THEY COULDN'T AGREE OVER THE MONEY
NOW I AM A WIFE
AND I TOO SHED TEARS AT THE SIGHT OF HER SYMPATHETIC EMOTION THOUGH I HAD NOT WEPT FOR MYSELF FOR MANY A WEEK
LET THEM TURN IT AS THEY WILL SAID I
WELL!--AN HONEST AND INDUSTRIOUS FARMER IS ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
HE ONLY ENOUGH MR HARGRAVE
THAT ANNABELLA WILMOT IN COMPARISON WITH YOU IS LIKE A FLAUNTING PEONY COMPARED WITH A SWEET WILD ROSEBUD GEMMED WITH DEW--AND I LOVE YOU TO DISTRACTION!--NOW TELL ME IF THAT INTELLIGENCE GIVES YOU ANY PLEASURE
IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT HE HAD HAD LITTLE DOUBT OF MY ACCEPTANCE AND NO IDEA OF A POSITIVE DENIAL
BUT THIS VOLUME I HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE
IF SHE DID NOT ANSWER THIS OF COURSE I SHOULD WRITE NO MORE
BUT ALL THIS I CAN READILY PARDON
I REMEMBER HOWEVER THAT I SWALLOWED WITH DIFFICULTY THE REMAINDER OF THE TEA THAT WAS IN MY CUP AND ATE NOTHING
A LADY OF HIGH REPUTE IN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD
ON THE ONE HAND I FELT A NEW-BORN CONFIDENCE IN MY POWERS OF PERSUASION--A STRONG CONVICTION THAT MY OWN FERVOUR OF SPIRIT WOULD GRANT ME ELOQUENCE--THAT MY VERY DETERMINATION--THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR SUCCEEDING THAT I FELT MUST WIN ME WHAT I SOUGHT
I WAS FOOLISHLY DISCONCERTED BY THE EVENT
I TRUSTED IT WAS ONLY A SERVANT AND DID NOT STIR
I KNOW THEM TO BE WRONG BECAUSE REASON AND GOD'S WORD DECLARE THEM TO BE SO
AND IF THE FORMER PART OF THIS CONTINUATION HAD BEEN TORN AWAY TO AVOID WOUNDING MY FEELINGS PERHAPS THE LATTER PORTION HAD BEEN REMOVED FOR FEAR OF MINISTERING TOO MUCH TO MY SELF-CONCEIT
I SHOULD ONLY THE SOONER BE RID OF HIM OH ANNABELLA CRIED MILICENT
BUT MY DEAR HE IS I BELIEVE FULL TEN YEARS OLDER THAN YOU--HOW IS IT THAT YOU ARE SO BEFOREHAND IN MORAL ACQUIREMENTS THANKS TO YOU AUNT I HAVE BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP AND HAD GOOD EXAMPLES ALWAYS BEFORE ME WHICH HE MOST LIKELY HAS NOT
I ROSE TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT BUT THEN HE PERCEIVED ME
THEY CANNOT WHEN THEY KNOW YOU OR IF THEY COULD THEY WOULD NOT BE TRUE FRIENDS--I SHOULD NOT CARE FOR THEIR ESTRANGEMENT
WHILE ON THE OTHER I FEARED TO LOSE THE GROUND I HAD ALREADY GAINED WITH SO MUCH TOIL AND SKILL AND DESTROY ALL FUTURE HOPE BY ONE RASH EFFORT WHEN TIME AND PATIENCE MIGHT HAVE WON SUCCESS
THE VERY FACT OF SITTING EXALTED ALOFT SURVEYING THE SNOWY LANDSCAPE AND SWEET SUNNY SKY INHALING THE PURE BRACING AIR AND CRUNCHING AWAY OVER THE CRISP FROZEN SNOW WAS EXHILARATING ENOUGH IN ITSELF
FOR WE TALKED A GOOD DEAL THOUGH MY STAY WAS BUT SHORT
WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU NEXT BUT IN SAYING THIS SHE LOOKED BACK AT LORD LOWBOROUGH WHO WAS STANDING A LITTLE BEHIND LEANING AGAINST THE BACK OF A CHAIR AN ATTENTIVE LISTENER TOO EXPERIENCING TO JUDGE BY HIS COUNTENANCE MUCH THE SAME FEELINGS OF MINGLED PLEASURE AND SADNESS AS I DID
INDEED IT IS PROBABLE THAT HAD SHE BEEN THERE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS CORDIALITY FREEDOM AND FROLIC AMONGST US THAN THERE WAS WITHOUT HER
BE SO GOOD AS TO ANNOUNCE ME IT'S NO MANNER OF USE MR MARKHAM
SO UNEXPECTED WAS THE APPARITION THAT I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT IT THE CREATION OF AN OVER-EXCITED IMAGINATION HAD THE SENSE OF SIGHT ALONE BORNE WITNESS TO HIS PRESENCE
HE DID NOT TALK MUCH TO ME BUT WHEN HE DID SPEAK IT WAS WITH A DEGREE OF FREEDOM AND OPENNESS AND KINDLINESS TOO THAT PLAINLY SEEMED TO INTIMATE HE KNEW HIS WORDS WERE MUSIC TO MY EARS
HE CAME THAT MORNING
AND WHILE YOU DO IT THE OTHER FANCIES FADE AWAY--BUT THIS ONLY STRENGTHENS.--GO ON--GO ON TILL IT VANISHES TOO
AND IF I COULD BENEFIT YOUR SOUL AS WELL AS YOUR BODY AND AWAKEN SOME SENSE OF CONTRITION AND OH YES
IS THAT THE EXTENT OF YOUR DOMESTIC VIRTUES
I SQUEEZED HIM IN MY ARMS AGAIN AND CRIED IN TEARFUL EARNEST DO DO PERSEVERE
SHALL I LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ALL
IF YOU COME WITH ME I SHALL ASSUREDLY KEEP YOU
BUT IN MY JUDGMENT WHAT THE WORLD STIGMATISES AS ROMANTIC IS OFTEN MORE NEARLY ALLIED TO THE TRUTH THAN IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED
THE GAME WAS A LONG ONE AND I DID GIVE HIM SOME TROUBLE
NOTHING COULD COMFORT HIM NOW
I CANNOT GET HIM TO WRITE OR SPEAK IN REAL SOLID EARNEST
BUT I DON'T WANT TO LULL YOU TO FALSE SECURITY
SPEAK AND I WILL GLADLY OBEY I HAVE NONE BUT THIS SAID I AS GRAVELY AS BEFORE
AND IF THAT OLD DEVIL RACHEL DOESN'T IMMEDIATELY DELIVER THEM UP SHE TRAMPS BAG AND BAGGAGE TOMORROW SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE I ANSWERED QUIETLY PLACING MY HAND UPON THEM AND TAKING THEM FROM THE DESK AS I THOUGHT UNOBSERVED
THE SNOW HEAVILY CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND BALLED THE HORSES FEET
IT'S NOT FOR MYSELF WHAT THEN RACHEL
IN ATTEMPTING TO DISENGAGE HIMSELF HIS FOOT SLIPPED AND DOWN HE TUMBLED--BUT NOT TO THE EARTH;--THE TREE STILL KEPT HIM SUSPENDED
AND HE WAS MY COMPANION DURING THE REMAINDER OF MY STAY WHICH WAS NOT LONG FOR MY AUNT AS USUAL INSISTED UPON AN EARLY DEPARTURE
THEY WERE ELIZA MILLWARD FERGUS AND ROSE
I WOULD RATHER BE LECTURED BY YOU THAN THE VICAR BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE LESS REMORSE IN TELLING YOU AT THE END OF THE DISCOURSE THAT I PRESERVE MY OWN OPINION PRECISELY THE SAME AS AT THE BEGINNING--AS WOULD BE THE CASE I AM PERSUADED WITH REGARD TO EITHER LOGICIAN YES OF COURSE REPLIED I DETERMINED TO BE AS PROVOKING AS HERSELF
WHAT A COLLECTION
BUT TO-DAY I DETERMINED TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO RETURN TO MY DUTY
IN THE SECOND IF YOU WILL BE SUCH A FOOL I CAN'T HINDER IT IF YOU AFFECT REPLIED HE EARNESTLY TO REGARD AS FOLLY THE BEST THE STRONGEST THE MOST GODLIKE IMPULSES OF OUR NATURE I DON'T BELIEVE YOU
HE ACCOSTED ME WITH A SLIGHT BOW AND EDGING CLOSE TO THE WALL ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ON
AND I SAW BY THE UNQUIET ASPECT OF HER EYE THAT FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER SHE WAS UNEASY AT THE CHILD'S POSITION
BUT IN MY PRESENT STATE OF NERVOUS EXCITEMENT THAT WAS ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION
I MUST NOT TAKE MY SON TO STARVE
SICKLY SIR ASKED MY TALKATIVE NEIGHBOUR STARING ME IN THE FACE
IF YOU THINK THERE'S DANGER SAVE ME FROM IT
I GLADLY CONSENTED OF COURSE
A FEW WORDS TO MY MOTHER AND SISTER I KNEW WOULD SUFFICE TO SPREAD THE NEWS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD WITHOUT ANY FURTHER EXERTION ON MY PART
IT STRUCK ME WITH DISMAY AT THE MOMENT WHEN I TOOK IT FROM THE BOX AND BEHELD THOSE EYES FIXED UPON ME IN THEIR MOCKING MIRTH AS IF EXULTING STILL IN HIS POWER TO CONTROL MY FATE AND DERIDING MY EFFORTS TO ESCAPE
HE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED IN THE GAME BUT CALM AND FEARLESS IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SUPERIOR SKILL
I WAS DETERMINED TO SHOW HIM THAT MY HEART WAS NOT HIS SLAVE AND I COULD LIVE WITHOUT HIM IF I CHOSE
AND I APPROACHED AND HALF EXTENDED MY HAND AS IF TO TAKE LEAVE--SHE GRASPED IT IN SILENCE
IN PASSING THE INHABITED WING OF THE BUILDING I CAUGHT A SIGHT OF MRS GRAHAM THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW SLOWLY PACING UP AND DOWN HER LONELY ROOM
BUT A CRABBED OLD CHERRY-TREE THAT GREW HARD BY CAUGHT HIM BY THE FROCK IN ONE OF ITS CROOKED SCRAGGY ARMS THAT STRETCHED OVER THE WALL
MARKHAM WILL YOU COME
HER COUNSELS MAY BE GOOD AS FAR AS THEY GO--IN THE MAIN POINTS AT LEAST;--BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS SHE HAS OVERLOOKED IN HER CALCULATIONS
I CAN AMUSE AND PLEASE HIM WITH MY SIMPLE SONGS BUT NOT DELIGHT HIM THUS
WELL EXCLAIMED THE INJURED MAN IN A TONE OF PSEUDO-RESIGNATION
IN A LITTLE WHILE WE BOTH RELAPSED INTO SILENCE AND CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES GAZING ABSTRACTEDLY INTO THE FIRE--SHE INTENT UPON HER OWN SAD THOUGHTS AND I REFLECTING HOW DELIGHTFUL IT WOULD BE TO BE SEATED THUS BESIDE HER WITH NO OTHER PRESENCE TO RESTRAIN OUR INTERCOURSE--NOT EVEN THAT OF ARTHUR OUR MUTUAL FRIEND WITHOUT WHOM WE HAD NEVER MET BEFORE--IF ONLY I COULD VENTURE TO SPEAK MY MIND AND DISBURDEN MY FULL HEART OF THE FEELINGS THAT HAD SO LONG OPPRESSED IT AND WHICH IT NOW STRUGGLED TO RETAIN WITH AN EFFORT THAT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE MUCH LONGER,--AND REVOLVING THE PROS AND CONS FOR OPENING MY HEART TO HER THERE AND THEN AND IMPLORING A RETURN OF AFFECTION THE PERMISSION TO REGARD HER THENCEFORTH AS MY OWN AND THE RIGHT AND THE POWER TO DEFEND HER FROM THE CALUMNIES OF MALICIOUS TONGUES
BUT HE IS OBLIGED TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS WHEN AND HOW HE COMES
A LONG LONG TIME TO LIVE AND NOT TO SEE HIM
HOW VIGOROUS MY LITTLE GODSON GROWS
THE PICTURE ITSELF I HAVE NOT DESTROYED AS I HAD FIRST INTENDED
I'VE SEEN THE LAST OF YOU I HOPE I MUTTERED AS I CLOSED THE DOOR UPON HIM
OH MISS
BUT INDEED IT IS NONSENSE TO TALK ABOUT INJURING NO ONE BUT YOURSELF
I AM A VERY QUIET PERSON AND SHALL KEEP MY OWN APARTMENTS AND ATTEND TO MY OWN CONCERNS AND ONLY SEE YOU NOW AND THEN OF COURSE I MOST READILY CONSENTED TO THIS
BUT DO YOU FOLLOW MY ADVICE
IMPETUOUS LONGINGS FOR A SPEEDY REUNION--AND IMPIOUS DEFIANCE OF GOD'S MANDATES AND RAILINGS AGAINST HIS PROVIDENCE FOR HAVING CAST THEIR LOT ASUNDER AND DOOMED THEM BOTH TO THE HATEFUL BONDAGE OF ALLIANCE WITH THOSE THEY COULD NOT LOVE
I DO NOT INSULT YOU CRIED HE
BUT AN OPIATE WAS ADMINISTERED
SHE BECAME MORE SOCIABLE AND I WAS BEGINNING TO BE VERY HAPPY
HE WINCED AT MY APPROACH WITH AN EXPRESSION OF AVERSION AND INSTINCTIVE PHYSICAL FEAR ANYTHING BUT CONCILIATORY TO MY FEELINGS
EVEN AN OCCASIONAL BEVY OF FRIENDS AT THE SHOOTING SEASON MAY BE BORNE IF ARTHUR GET SO FIRMLY ATTACHED TO ME SO WELL ESTABLISHED IN GOOD SENSE AND PRINCIPLES BEFORE THEY COME THAT I SHALL BE ABLE BY REASON AND AFFECTION TO KEEP HIM PURE FROM THEIR CONTAMINATIONS
AND A DREARY RIDE WE HAD OF IT THAT LAST STAGE OF THE JOURNEY COLD AND WEARY AS WE WERE
HE SUFFERS MUCH AND HAS NO FORTITUDE TO BEAR HIM THROUGH
NOT LATELY I REPLIED IN A CARELESS TONE BUT STERNLY REPELLING HER ODIOUS GLANCES WITH MY EYES
SHE SHALL GO WITH US
HE HAS BEEN IN PERSON TO STANINGLEY SEEKING REDRESS FOR HIS GRIEVANCES--EXPECTING TO HEAR OF HIS VICTIMS IF NOT TO FIND THEM THERE--AND HAS TOLD SO MANY LIES AND WITH SUCH UNBLUSHING COOLNESS THAT MY UNCLE MORE THAN HALF BELIEVES HIM AND STRONGLY ADVOCATES MY GOING BACK TO HIM AND BEING FRIENDS AGAIN
YES LAWRENCE
THE ROSE I GAVE YOU WAS AN EMBLEM OF MY HEART SAID SHE
AND A SUDDEN FLUSH SUFFUSED HER FEATURES--WHETHER OF SHAME OR ANGER I COULD NOT TELL
BUT YOU MUST TELL ME HOW FOR I WANT TO BE CIVIL AND YET DECIDED--AND WHEN I'VE GOT RID OF HIM I'LL GIVE YOU MY REASONS AFTERWARDS BUT STAY HELEN
BUT BEING PREVIOUSLY PREPARED I PRESERVED AN ASPECT OF STOICAL INDIFFERENCE
I SPARED HIM MY EXHORTATIONS AND FRUITLESS EFFORTS AT CONVERSION TOO FOR I SAW IT WAS ALL IN VAIN
4TH
AND SHE LIKE A GOOD GIRL INFORMS ME SHE CANNOT THINK OF IT WITHOUT HER UNCLE'S AND AUNT'S CONSENT
I MUST HAVE PATIENCE AND GATHER A HOARD OF MY OWN
HIS EYE MET MINE KEENLY BUT STEADILY
AND THOUGH I COULD NOT PREVENT HIM FROM TAKING MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM STILL BY INCESSANT PERSEVERANCE BY KINDNESS AND FIRMNESS AND VIGILANCE BY COAXING AND DARING AND DETERMINATION I SUCCEEDED IN PRESERVING HIM FROM ABSOLUTE BONDAGE TO THAT DETESTABLE PROPENSITY SO INSIDIOUS IN ITS ADVANCES SO INEXORABLE IN ITS TYRANNY SO DISASTROUS IN ITS EFFECTS
AND SHE SHOULD HELP ME FIRST TO FIND OUT A PICTURE-DEALER IN SOME DISTANT TOWN
THE JOURNEY HOMEWARD WAS BY NO MEANS SO AGREEABLE TO ME AS THE FORMER PART OF THE DAY
IT WOULD BE WRONG TO FORGET ONE SO DEEPLY AND FONDLY DEVOTED TO HER WHO CAN SO THOROUGHLY APPRECIATE HER EXCELLENCIES AND SYMPATHISE WITH ALL HER THOUGHTS AS I CAN DO AND IT WOULD BE WRONG IN ME TO FORGET SO EXCELLENT AND DIVINE A PIECE OF GOD'S CREATION AS SHE WHEN I HAVE ONCE SO TRULY LOVED AND KNOWN HER BUT I SAID NO MORE TO HIM ON THAT SUBJECT
AND BIDDING THEM SEND THE CONVEYANCE AFTER ME IF IT WERE READY WITHIN AN HOUR I SET OFF AS FAST AS I COULD WALK
AND THE FIRST USE HE MADE OF HIS RETURNING STRENGTH WAS TO RIDE OVER BY NIGHT TO WILDFELL HALL TO SEE HIS SISTER
I DO ALL I CAN TO AMUSE HIM BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HIM TO FEEL INTERESTED IN WHAT I MOST LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND HE LIKES TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT CANNOT INTEREST ME--OR EVEN THAT ANNOY ME--AND THESE PLEASE HIM--THE MOST OF ALL
MY MOTHER HAD DONE HER UTMOST TO PERSUADE ME THAT I WAS CAPABLE OF GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS
IT SOUNDS MORE SISTERLY AND IT WILL SERVE TO REMIND ME OF OUR CONTRACT SHE SMILED AND ONCE MORE BID ME GO
THUS NOT ONLY HAVE I THE FATHER'S SPIRIT IN THE SON TO CONTEND AGAINST THE GERMS OF HIS EVIL TENDENCIES TO SEARCH OUT AND ERADICATE AND HIS CORRUPTING INTERCOURSE AND EXAMPLE IN AFTER-LIFE TO COUNTERACT BUT ALREADY HE COUNTERACTS MY ARDUOUS LABOUR FOR THE CHILD'S ADVANTAGE DESTROYS MY INFLUENCE OVER HIS TENDER MIND AND ROBS ME OF HIS VERY LOVE
HIS SUFFERINGS AND MY OWN LABORIOUS CARE HAVE GIVEN HIM SOME CLAIM TO MY REGARD--TO MY AFFECTION EVEN IF HE WOULD ONLY BE QUIET AND SINCERE AND CONTENT TO LET THINGS REMAIN AS THEY ARE
I INSTANTLY TURNED AWAY LEST HE SHOULD SEE AND MISCONSTRUE MY EMOTION
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE TO PUT MYSELF UNDER OBLIGATIONS THAT I CAN NEVER REPAY--I AM OBLIGED TO YOU ALREADY FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO MY SON
AND DON'T BREATHE A WORD OF WHAT IT TELLS YOU TO ANY LIVING BEING
GOD WILL JUDGE US BY OUR OWN THOUGHTS AND DEEDS NOT BY WHAT OTHERS SAY ABOUT US
FOR NOW MRS GRAHAM WAS IN THE CARRIAGE AND ELIZA MILLWARD WAS THE COMPANION OF MY WALK
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEM
BESIDES MAMMA IS SO DELIGHTED WITH THE IDEA OF THE MATCH
HE PRECIPITATED HIMSELF TOWARDS ME
SHORTLY AFTER THEY TOOK THEIR LEAVE
THEY ARE NOT LONG BUT PASSING SWEET AND JUST LIKE HIMSELF FULL OF ARDENT AFFECTION AND PLAYFUL LIVELY HUMOUR
HE WANTED TO APPEAR AS BUSY AND AS UNCONCERNED AS I DID
BUT ARE YOU SURE YOUR DARLING HUNTINGDON DESERVES ALL THE LOVE YOU GIVE TO HIM I KNEW NOT WHAT TO ANSWER TO THIS
BUT AFTER STUDIOUSLY REGARDING IT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO A BRIGHT IDEA SEEMED TO STRIKE HIM FOR HE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED BUT I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO AND THEN RETURNED AND TOOK HIS SEAT AT THE TABLE
AND HER CHARACTER IS SO WELL KNOWN TO THEM ALL THAT NEARLY RELATED TO ME AS SHE IS I COULD NOT ATTEMPT TO DEFEND IT
I ONLY FEAR YOU ONLY REGRET THE PAST FOR ITS CONSEQUENCES TO YOURSELF JUST SO--EXCEPT THAT I'M SORRY TO HAVE WRONGED YOU NELL BECAUSE YOU'RE SO GOOD TO ME THINK OF THE GOODNESS OF GOD AND YOU CANNOT BUT BE GRIEVED TO HAVE OFFENDED HIM WHAT IS GOD?--I CANNOT SEE HIM OR HEAR HIM.--GOD IS ONLY AN IDEA GOD IS INFINITE WISDOM AND POWER AND GOODNESS--AND LOVE
WE INTEND STICKING FIRM BY THE RASCALS AS LONG AS THEY DELIGHT US WHICH I AM GLAD TO SAY THEY DO AT PRESENT THAT THE AUTHOR OF WILDFELL HALL SHOULD EVER HAVE DELIGHTED IN THE GONDALS SHOULD EVER HAVE WRITTEN THE STORY OF SOLALA VERNON OR HENRY SOPHONA IS PLEASANT TO KNOW
I WAS IN SUCH A GOOD HUMOUR THAT NIGHT
AND THEN LOST IN MELANCHOLY MUSINGS PAUSED AGAIN AND LEANT MY BACK AGAINST A ROUGH OLD TREE THAT GREW BESIDE THE ROAD
BUT HE'S REFORMED NOW
I KNOW SHE MUST BE PAINED TO PART WITH YOU AND I AM WILLING TO MAKE ANY REPARATION IN MY POWER
SHE OUTSHINES US ALL IN SINGING AND MUSIC TOO MISS WILSON DEMURRED
QUARRELLING MARKHAM CRIED THE LATTER ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO ME,--'AND ABOUT THAT YOUNG WIDOW I DOUBT HE ADDED REPROACHFULLY SHAKING HIS HEAD
AND WITH A CHILDLIKE IMPULSE SHE EXPRESSED HER SYMPATHY BY SUDDENLY KISSING MY CHEEK WITHOUT A WORD OF REPLY AND THEN TURNING QUICKLY AWAY CAUGHT UP HER BABY AND HID HER FACE IN ITS FROCK
NOTHING MOVES YOU
AND STILL THE MORE I THOUGHT UPON HER CONDUCT THE MORE I HATED HER
AND TILL HE DOES RETURN HE BEGS I WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE TO HIM CONSTANTLY FOR THOUGH HE IS SOMETIMES TOO IDLE AND OFTEN TOO BUSY TO ANSWER MY LETTERS AS THEY COME HE LIKES TO RECEIVE THEM DAILY
AND I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO TELL HER
FOR I AM NOT SURE THAT A SPECIES OF EXULTATION IN WHAT I HAD DONE WAS NOT ONE PRINCIPAL CONCOMITANT
BUT I SAW HIM PUT HIS ARM ROUND HER WAIST WHILE SHE LOVINGLY RESTED HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER;--AND THEN A TREMULOUS DARKNESS OBSCURED MY SIGHT MY HEART SICKENED AND MY HEAD BURNED LIKE FIRE
BUT POOR FELLOW ADDED HE WITH A SENTIMENTAL SIGH--'HIS HEART'S BROKEN--THAT'S THE TRUTH OF IT--AND HIS HEAD'S WILL YOU BE SILENT NOW CRIED I STARTING UP AND EYEING THE FELLOW SO FIERCELY THAT MY MOTHER THINKING I MEANT TO INFLICT SOME GRIEVOUS BODILY INJURY LAID HER HAND ON MY ARM AND BESOUGHT ME TO LET HIM ALONE AND HE WALKED LEISURELY OUT WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS SINGING PROVOKINGLY--'SHALL I BECAUSE A WOMAN'S FAIR C
I HOPE YOU'RE SATISFIED HIS FACE GREW BLANCHED WITH ANGER
ELIZA SEEMED TO HAVE MADE THE SAME RESOLUTION ON HER PART
BUT YOU TURNING TO HATTERSLEY IF YOU PRESUME TO HAVE ANY DOUBTS ON THE SUBJECT ASK MR HARGRAVE AT THIS THEY SIMULTANEOUSLY BURST INTO A RUDE LAUGH THAT MADE MY WHOLE FRAME TINGLE TO THE FINGERS ENDS
FOR THOUGH FOR MY OWN SAKE SUCH A HERMITAGE APPEARS LIKE PARADISE ITSELF COMPARED WITH MY PRESENT SITUATION YET FOR MY FRIENDS SAKES FOR MILICENT AND ESTHER MY SISTERS IN HEART AND AFFECTION FOR THE POOR TENANTS OF GRASSDALE AND ABOVE ALL FOR MY AUNT I WILL STAY IF I POSSIBLY CAN
SHE DID NOT MANIFEST HER CHAGRIN BY KEEN REPROACHES BITTER SARCASMS OR POUTING SULLEN SILENCE--ANY OR ALL OF THESE I COULD EASILY HAVE ENDURED OR LIGHTLY LAUGHED AWAY
HIS MOTHER EVIDENTLY WAS QUITE DELIGHTED WITH HIS DUTIFUL ATTENTIONS AND NEWLY-ACQUIRED DOMESTIC HABITS
BUT I MUST SAY I THANK GOD I AM NOT SUCH ANOTHER PERHAPS IT WOULD BECOME YOU BETTER SAID I TO LOOK AT WHAT YOU ARE AND SAY GOD BE MERCIFUL TO ME A SINNER YOU ARE SEVERE RETURNED HE BOWING SLIGHTLY AND DRAWING HIMSELF UP WITH A PROUD YET INJURED AIR
YOU'LL GET YOUR DEATH OF COLD I WON'T TILL I'VE TOLD YOU WHAT I CAME FOR
IT SHOWS AT LEAST THAT THE AFFECTION IS GENUINE
AS I TROTTED ALONG HOWEVER CHEWING THE CUD OF--BITTER FANCIES I HEARD ANOTHER HORSE AT NO GREAT DISTANCE BEHIND ME
FOR WE SHALL LEAVE HIM HOURS BEFORE THE DAWN AND IT IS NOT PROBABLE HE WILL DISCOVER THE LOSS OF BOTH UNTIL THE DAY IS FAR ADVANCED
AND GRIMSBY WORSE THAN ALL ENDEAVOURED TO MAKE ME ASHAMED OF MY VIRTUE BY SUCH GALLING SARCASMS AND INNUENDOES AS HE KNEW WOULD WOUND ME THE MOST
A FORTNIGHT PASSED AWAY AND MY INQUIRIES WERE ALWAYS ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE
FOR I DID NOT DOUBT SHE WOULD COME
SO YOU NEED NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF ANY LONGER TO FEIGN THE LOVE YOU CANNOT FEEL
AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE VICAR ENTERED THE ROOM
FORMERLY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO ACT THUS--AT LEAST BEFORE ANY OTHER WITNESSES THAN HIS BOON COMPANIONS OR SUCH AS THEY
IT WAS NOT IN THE NEWEST FASHION OF COURSE
BUT I KNOW YOU CANNOT LOVE ME AS YOU ONCE DID--AND I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY IF YOU WERE TO FOR I COULD NOT PRETEND TO RETURN IT
I EXONERATED HIM FROM THAT CHARGE NOW AND DEEPLY LAMENTED MY FORMER UNGENEROUS SUSPICIONS
I HAVE THE SERVANTS TO OVERLOOK AND MY LITTLE ARTHUR TO ATTEND TO,--AND MY OWN HEALTH TOO ALL OF WHICH WOULD BE ENTIRELY NEGLECTED WERE I TO SATISFY HIS EXORBITANT DEMANDS
BUT HER COUNTENANCE CHANGED WHEN SHE HEARD HATTERSLEY'S VOICE SHOUTING THROUGH DOOR AND WALL,--'I'M YOUR MAN
AND EVEN IF SHE SHOULD HAVE A LINGERING AFFECTION FOR ME STILL OUGHT I TO DISTURB HER PEACE BY AWAKENING THOSE FEELINGS
THE GENTLEMEN SEEMED BETTER BUT PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE I KNEW THEM LESS--PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY FLATTERED ME
I THOUGHT IT BUT CIVIL TO TAKE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF RETURNING THEIR KIND ATTENTIONS SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN SO VERY PARTICULAR AND CONSTANT IN THEIR INQUIRIES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COURSE OF MY ILLNESS IT'S ALL MISS WILSON'S DOING AND IF IT IS RETURNED HE WITH A VERY PERCEPTIBLE BLUSH IS THAT ANY REASON WHY I SHOULD NOT MAKE A SUITABLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT IT IS A REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT MAKE THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT SHE LOOKS FOR LET US DROP THAT SUBJECT IF YOU PLEASE SAID HE IN EVIDENT DISPLEASURE
IT WAS ONE I HAD TAKEN GREAT PAINS WITH AND I INTENDED IT TO BE MY MASTERPIECE THOUGH IT WAS SOMEWHAT PRESUMPTUOUS IN THE DESIGN
DO YOU KNOW BETTER THEN I THINK I DO WHAT MAKES YOU LOOK SO PALE THEN SAID SHE SMILING WITH DELIGHT AT MY EMOTION
IT IS NOT RED AT ALL
I ATTEMPTED TO TAKE HIM BY THE ARM
IT IS ONLY BY HINTS AND INNUENDOES AND BY WHAT I HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THEY THINK WELL THEN I WON'T GO TO-DAY AS IT'S GETTING LATISH
ARTHUR WAS CLAD IN HIS PLAINEST CLOTHES AND WRAPPED IN A COARSE WOOLLEN SHAWL
TELL ME CONTINUED HE--'I WANT TO KNOW,--BECAUSE IF YOU WERE I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU,--AND IF NOT I'LL GO GO THEN I CRIED
MAY I TELL YOU SOMETHING MRS HUNTINGDON SAID HE IN A SUBDUED TONE WITH SERIOUS DOWNCAST EYES
AND SO THAT POINT WAS SETTLED
AND EVERY OBJECTION WAS OVERRULED
AT PRESENT I AM GOING TO TAKE THE CHILDREN TO THE NURSERY BUT CAN'T YOU RING AND SEND THEM NO
GO LOVE REPEATED SHE MORE URGENTLY AND IN A TONE WHICH THOUGH NOT UNKIND DEMANDED PROMPT OBEDIENCE AND OBTAINED IT
YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU'RE HIS SISTER
AND INSTEAD OF ADVANCING TO MEET HIM I TURNED TO THE WINDOW TO HIDE OR SUBDUE MY EMOTION
NO NO I ANSWERED RECOLLECTING HOW STRANGE MY CONDUCT MUST APPEAR
I POSITIVELY THINK I ILL-USE HER SOMETIMES WHEN I'VE TAKEN TOO MUCH--BUT I CAN'T HELP IT FOR SHE NEVER COMPLAINS EITHER AT THE TIME OR AFTER
BE SATISFIED WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING ARTHUR RE-ENTERED THE ROOM--GOOD BOY FOR KEEPING OUT SO LONG
I FOUND HER AS USUAL BUSY WITH SOME PIECE OF SOFT EMBROIDERY THE MANIA FOR BERLIN WOOLS HAD NOT YET COMMENCED WHILE HER SISTER WAS SEATED AT THE CHIMNEY-CORNER WITH THE CAT ON HER KNEE MENDING A HEAP OF STOCKINGS
IT IS ALL NONSENSE HELEN--A JEST A MERE NOTHING--NOT WORTH A THOUGHT
BUT STILL I HOPED I TRUSTED THEY HAD NO FOUNDATION BUT IN SOME IDLE RUMOUR OF THE SERVANTS FROM WHAT THEY HAD SEEN IN LADY LOWBOROUGH'S MANNER LAST MONTH
SHE HOWEVER ATTENTIVELY WATCHED MY LOOKS AND HER ARTIST'S PRIDE WAS GRATIFIED NO DOUBT TO READ MY HEARTFELT ADMIRATION IN MY EYES
WHAT WAS THAT STORY ABOUT HIS INTRIGUE WITH A MARRIED LADY--LADY WHO WAS IT?--MISS WILMOT HERSELF WAS TELLING YOU THE OTHER DAY IT WAS FALSE--FALSE I CRIED
AND THERE HE HAD IT STILL IN HIS POSSESSION AN ETERNAL MONUMENT TO HIS PRIDE AND MY HUMILIATION
MY CONSCIENCE DOES NOT BLAME ME BUT WHILE THE PURPOSE RIPENS LET ME BEGUILE A FEW OF THESE LONG WINTER EVENINGS IN STATING THE CASE FOR MY OWN SATISFACTION
SOME MORE WORDS PASSED BETWEEN THEM WHICH HAPPILY I DID NOT OVERHEAR
OH DON'T LET US DISTURB YOU MR MARKHAM SAID SHE
I AM QUITE ASHAMED OF MY NEW-SPRUNG DISTASTE FOR COUNTRY LIFE
FOR I COULD NOT DOUBT IT WAS YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT SHE WAS ABOUT TO MENTION THOUGH NOT VERY FAVOURABLY OF COURSE
FOR A TIME AT LEAST AND BEFORE A HARD AND DEGRADING EXPERIENCE HAD BROKEN THE SPRING OF HER YOUTH AND REPLACED THE DISINTERESTED AND SPONTANEOUS PLEASURE THAT IS TO BE GOT FROM THE LIFE AND PLAY OF IMAGINATION BY A SAD SENSE OF DUTY AND AN INEXORABLE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS MISSION ANNE BRONTE WROTE STORIES FOR HER OWN AMUSEMENT AND LOVED THE RASCALS SHE CREATED
WHAT YOU SEE IN LIFE I DON'T KNOW--I SEE ONLY THE BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS AND A FEARFUL LOOKING FOR OF JUDGMENT AND FIERY INDIGNATION ALL THE COMPANY SIMULTANEOUSLY PUSHED UP THEIR GLASSES TO HIM AND I SET THEM BEFORE HIM IN A SEMICIRCLE AND TENDERLY PATTING HIM ON THE BACK BID HIM DRINK AND HE WOULD SOON SEE AS BRIGHT A PROSPECT AS ANY OF US
SO YOU SEE LADIES YOU OUGHT TO MAKE ME WELCOME WHEN I HAVE BRAVED AND SUFFERED SO MUCH FOR THE FAVOUR OF YOUR SWEET SOCIETY HE SMILINGLY TURNED TO ME AND BOWED AS HE FINISHED THE SENTENCE
HER DAUGHTER JANE WAS OF COURSE AS GRACEFUL AND ELEGANT AS WITTY AND SEDUCTIVE AS SHE COULD POSSIBLY MANAGE TO BE
I SHRUNK AMONG THE BUSHES AND LEANT AGAINST THE TRUNK OF A TREE TO LET HER PASS
I'VE SAID ENOUGH THEN I'D CRY PERSISTED SHE
AT YOUR TIME OF LIFE IT'S LOVE THAT RULES THE ROAST
IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING BEFORE I JOINED THE COMPANY
HAPPILY I DID NOT YIELD TO THE IMPULSE
AND THOUGH I ABHOR MY OWN LIFE I'LL LEAVE THAT TOO TO HIM THAT GAVE IT BUT YOU SEE IN THIS CASE PLEADED HATTERSLEY I'LL NOT HEAR YOU EXCLAIMED HIS COMPANION HASTILY TURNING AWAY
NOT THAT I SHOULD DOUBT YOUR WORD IF YOU PROMISED NOT TO VISIT ME BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE MORE TRANQUIL IN YOUR OWN MIND IF YOU KNEW YOU COULD NOT DO IT AND LIKELY TO FIND LESS DIFFICULTY IN ABSTRACTING YOURSELF FROM ME IF YOU COULD NOT PICTURE MY SITUATION TO YOUR MIND
SHE MET MY EYE AS UNFLINCHINGLY AS IF HER BOSOM HAD BEEN STEELED WITH CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE
I KNOW SHE IS AN ANGEL AND I AM A PRESUMPTUOUS DOG TO DREAM OF POSSESSING SUCH A TREASURE
SHE STRAIGHTWAY BEGAN TO TALK TO HIM ON INDIFFERENT MATTERS WHILE I AMUSED MYSELF WITH LOOKING AT THE PICTURES
BUT I CAN ONLY NOW REGRET THAT I DID NOT SEE IT IN THIS LIGHT BEFORE AND THAT AS YOU SAY NOTHING CAN RECALL THE PAST SOMETHING IN MY VOICE OR IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS ANSWER SEEMED TO ALTER HIS MOOD
DO YOU KNOW ME ASKED MR HUNTINGDON INTENTLY PERUSING HIS FEATURES
AS LONG AS THEY CAN CONTRIVE TO MAKE A RESPECTABLE APPEARANCE ONCE A YEAR WHEN THEY COME TO TOWN HE GIVES HIMSELF LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT THEIR PRIVATE STINTINGS AND STRUGGLES AT HOME
BUT HIS MIND WAS OTHERWISE OCCUPIED FOR IN A WHILE HE LOOKED UP WISTFULLY IN MY FACE AND GRAVELY ASKED,--'MAMMA WHY ARE YOU WICKED WHO TOLD YOU I WAS WICKED LOVE RACHEL NO ARTHUR RACHEL NEVER SAID SO I AM CERTAIN WELL THEN IT WAS PAPA REPLIED HE THOUGHTFULLY
MUCH OF MY NEW-BORN STRENGTH AND COURAGE FORSOOK ME I CONFESS AS I ENTERED IT AND SHUT OUT THE FRESH WIND AND THE GLORIOUS SKY
GOOD-MORNING MR MARKHAM SAID SHE
AT LENGTH HE GREW DESPERATE AND WE WERE DAILY ON THE LOOK-OUT FOR A CASE OF FELO-DE-SE_--NO GREAT MATTER SOME OF US WHISPERED AS HIS EXISTENCE HAD CEASED TO BE AN ACQUISITION TO OUR CLUB
IF IT IS ANYTHING OF REAL IMPORTANCE SPEAK IT IN THREE WORDS BEFORE I GO IN THREE WORDS I CANNOT
SO SWEET SO BRIGHT SO GENIAL THAT I COULD NOT POSSIBLY RETAIN MY ANGER
BUT NOW I SEE WHAT IT IS THAT KEEPS ME BACK AND WHAT'S WANTED TO SAVE ME
IT WAS MR LAWRENCE ON HIS GREY PONY
THE BOXES WERE ALL CORDED BY BENSON AND QUIETLY CONVEYED DOWN THE BACK STAIRS AFTER DUSK AND SENT AWAY IN A CART TO THE M COACH-OFFICE
WHY NOT HAVE RECOURSE TO THE OLD EXPEDIENT AND ADD THIS LAST EVENT TO MY CHRONICLE
NOT BY FALSE PROFESSIONS OF LOVE AND NOT BY PRETENDED REMORSE BUT BY MITIGATING MY HABITUAL COLDNESS OF MANNER AND COMMUTING MY FRIGID CIVILITY INTO KINDNESS WHEREVER AN OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED
HELEN HUNTINGDON
HELEN HUNTINGDON
I BEG YOUR PARDON HE EXCLAIMED ON SEEING ME
LET ME LOOK AT THESE PICTURES FIRST
HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKED WITH HER DARK RINGLETS STREAMING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE HER FAIR CHEEK SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND HER COUNTENANCE RADIANT WITH SMILES
BUT HE AFFIRMED THAT HE SAW NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT ENJOY A CRACK WITH MARKHAM AND THE OLD LADY MY MOTHER WAS NOT OLD REALLY AND BONNY MISS ROSE AND THE PARSON AS WELL AS THE BEST;--AND HE WAS IN THE RIGHT OF IT TOO
A PRISON AND DESPAIR BEHIND ME RECEDING FURTHER FURTHER BACK AT EVERY CLATTER OF THE HORSES FEET
HEREAFTER I SHALL NEVER PERMIT MYSELF TO UTTER A WORD IN HIS DISPRAISE HOWEVER HE MAY SEEM TO DESERVE IT
IT WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN A TETE-A-TETE FOR MISS MILLWARD NEVER OPENED HER LIPS EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY TO CORRECT SOME RANDOM ASSERTION OR EXAGGERATED EXPRESSION OF HER SISTER'S AND ONCE TO ASK HER TO PICK UP THE BALL OF COTTON THAT HAD ROLLED UNDER THE TABLE
NAY SOMETIMES NOT A LITTLE
I HAVE OFTEN WISHED IN VAIN SAID SHE FOR ANOTHER'S JUDGMENT TO APPEAL TO WHEN I COULD SCARCELY TRUST THE DIRECTION OF MY OWN EYE AND HEAD THEY HAVING BEEN SO LONG OCCUPIED WITH THE CONTEMPLATION OF A SINGLE OBJECT AS TO BECOME ALMOST INCAPABLE OF FORMING A PROPER IDEA RESPECTING IT THAT REPLIED I IS ONLY ONE OF MANY EVILS TO WHICH A SOLITARY LIFE EXPOSES US TRUE SAID SHE
LET THEM GO TO THE DEUCE WITH THEIR VILE CONSTRUCTIONS AND THEIR LYING INVENTIONS THIS OUTBURST BROUGHT A FLUSH OF COLOUR TO HER FACE
HAD WE BEEN LEFT TWO MINUTES LONGER STANDING THERE ALONE I CANNOT ANSWER FOR THE CONSEQUENCES
EVERYTHING I SAW AND HEARD SEEMED TO SICKEN MY HEART--THE HALL THE LAMP THE STAIRCASE THE DOORS OF THE DIFFERENT APARTMENTS THE SOCIAL SOUND OF TALK AND LAUGHTER FROM THE DRAWING-ROOM
I WILL THIS INSTANT,--IF YOU'LL ONLY SAY YOU LOVE ME YOU KNOW I DO I ANSWERED
MY LITTLE COMPANION LED ME UP THE PARK DISCOURSING MERRILY ALL THE WAY
HE TOLD ME HE HAD BROUGHT A MESSAGE FROM HIS MOTHER WHO AS HE WAS RIDING THAT WAY HAD DESIRED HIM TO CALL AT THE MANOR AND BEG THE PLEASURE OF MY COMPANY TO A FRIENDLY FAMILY DINNER TO-MORROW
WATERING-PLACES WERE SO INTOLERABLY DULL
WAS IT HIS
I'LL TELL YOU AT ONCE SAID I
YOU DON'T LOVE ME WITH ALL YOUR HEART I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU ARTHUR AT LEAST I HOPE I DON'T
AND THE REST MAY BE SPOKEN TO THE WIND IF YOU ARE ANXIOUS TO SAY ANYTHING MORE ON THE SUBJECT REPLIED SHE AS SHE SHOOK HANDS WITH ROSE YOU MUST BRING YOUR SISTER TO SEE ME SOME FINE DAY AND I'LL LISTEN AS PATIENTLY AS YOU COULD WISH TO WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO SAY
SOON AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE GUESTS MY MOTHER MENTIONED MRS GRAHAM REGRETTED SHE WAS NOT THERE TO MEET THEM AND EXPLAINED TO THE MILLWARDS AND WILSONS THE REASONS SHE HAD GIVEN FOR NEGLECTING TO RETURN THEIR CALLS HOPING THEY WOULD EXCUSE HER AS SHE WAS SURE SHE DID NOT MEAN TO BE UNCIVIL AND WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE THEM AT ANY TIME.--'BUT SHE IS A VERY SINGULAR LADY MR LAWRENCE ADDED SHE
I THEREFORE HESITATED TO REPLY
IT'S TIME YOU SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE FERGUS SAID I AS SOON AS A MOMENTARY PAUSE IN HIS NARRATION ALLOWED ME TO GET IN A WORD
HE WROTE TO ME TWICE OR THRICE FROM F BUT HIS LETTERS WERE MOST PROVOKINGLY UNSATISFACTORY DEALING IN GENERALITIES OR IN TRIFLES THAT I CARED NOTHING ABOUT OR REPLETE WITH FANCIES AND REFLECTIONS EQUALLY UNWELCOME TO ME AT THE TIME SAYING NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT HIS SISTER AND LITTLE MORE ABOUT HIMSELF
MILICENT WAS TROUBLED TO SEE ME SO DISTURBED
POOR THING
BUT I DID NOT FEEL SO ANXIOUS ABOUT HIM NOW
SHE PROFESSES TO HAVE DISCOVERED NUMBERLESS VIRTUES AND PERFECTIONS IN HER HUSBAND SOME OF WHICH I FEAR LESS PARTIAL EYES WOULD FAIL TO DISTINGUISH THOUGH THEY SOUGHT THEM CAREFULLY WITH TEARS
YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL FALLIBLE CREATURES HELEN
NOW IF THIS MOOD CONTINUE I SHALL HAVE LESS DIFFICULTY IN EMANCIPATING MY AFFECTIONS FROM HER SOFT YET UNRELENTING SWAY
AND IF YOU OPPRESSED ME IN BODY MIND OR ESTATE YOU SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE NO REASON TO SUPPOSE I DIDN'T MIND IT I KNOW THAT MY LADY
HE IS LIKE YOU FREDERICK SAID I IN SOME OF HIS MOODS
ON ONE OCCASION WHEN MR HATTERSLEY HAD DRIVEN THEM OVER TO GRASSDALE IN THE PHAETON WITH LITTLE HELEN AND RALPH AND WE WERE ALL ENJOYING OURSELVES IN THE GARDEN--I HAD A FEW MINUTES CONVERSATION WITH THAT GENTLEMAN WHILE THE LADIES WERE AMUSING THEMSELVES WITH THE CHILDREN
BUT IF I HAD KNOWN THE DEPTH OF YOUR REGARD THE GENEROUS DISINTERESTED AFFECTION YOU SEEM TO FEEL SEEM HELEN THAT YOU DO FEEL THEN I WOULD HAVE ACTED DIFFERENTLY HOW
I MUST HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT YOU ARE SAFE AND WELL THOUGH FAR AWAY
BY YOUR THROWING THE BOOK AT HIM
THEY SAY IT IS ALL THESE CURSED WOMEN AND THAT WE ARE THE BANE OF THE WORLD
AND THEN TAKING HIS HAND FROM HER HEAD SHE KISSED IT WITH AN AIR OF GENUINE DEVOTION AND TRIPPED AWAY TO THE DOOR
I HATE ANYBODY TO COME UPON ME SO UNEXPECTEDLY WHY WHAT DID YOU TAKE ME FOR SAID I
WHAT DO YOU THINK HELEN UNWILLING TO DEPRESS HIM I GAVE THE MOST CHEERING ANSWER I COULD BUT STILL RECOMMENDED HIM TO PREPARE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT I INLY FEARED WAS BUT TOO CERTAIN
YOU CANNOT TELL WHAT PROVIDENCE MAY HAVE IN STORE FOR YOU
WITH AN ELBOW ON EACH SIDE OF IT AND MY HANDS CLASPED BEFORE MY EYES I DELIVERED MYSELF UP TO SILENT WEEPING
FOR I HAD THOROUGHLY MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT
I SHALL NOT TROUBLE MYSELF TO PUT DOWN ALL THAT PASSED BETWEEN US
THEN APPROACHING A LITTLE NEARER HE DROPPED ON ONE KNEE--NOT IN MOCK HUMILITY BUT TO BRING HIMSELF NEARER MY LEVEL AND LEANING HIS HAND ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR HE BEGAN IN A LOW VOICE
YOU ARE NOT AWARE THAT SHE IS SELFISH COLD-HEARTED AMBITIOUS ARTFUL SHALLOW-MINDED ENOUGH MARKHAM--ENOUGH NO
NO CONSIDERATION CAN INDUCE ME TO MARRY AGAINST MY INCLINATIONS
DO YOU REALLY LOVE ME SAID I SERIOUSLY PAUSING AND LOOKING HIM CALMLY IN THE FACE
NOT HIS CURSE GOD HELP ME THEN--FOR I'M SURE I NEED IT
I KNOW MY DEAR THAT THERE EXISTS A CONSIDERABLE DISPARITY BETWEEN US IN YEARS IN TEMPERAMENT AND PERHAPS SOME OTHER THINGS
FOR THE GREATER THE HAPPINESS THAT NATURE SETS BEFORE ME THE MORE I LAMENT THAT HE IS NOT HERE TO TASTE IT
BUT AFTERWARDS WHEN WE WERE ALL AGAIN ASSEMBLED IN THE DRAWING-ROOM I WAS INDEMNIFIED FOR SO MUCH SUFFERING BY A FEW DELIGHTFUL MINUTES OF CONVERSATION WITH MR HUNTINGDON
BUT HEAVEN HELP ME
AND THEN OF LONG HOURS SPENT IN BITTER TEARS AND LAMENTATIONS AND MELANCHOLY MUSINGS IN THE LONELY VALLEY WITH THE ETERNAL MUSIC IN MY EARS OF THE WEST WIND RUSHING THROUGH THE OVERSHADOWING TREES AND THE BROOK BABBLING AND GURGLING ALONG ITS STONY BED
DO HAVE DONE WITH THAT INFERNAL CLATTER CRIED HIS MASTER
I BELIEVE SO I TRUST I SHALL FOR I'VE A LITTLE BIT OF NEWS FOR HER--IF YOU HAVEN'T FORESTALLED ME I YES
YOU'RE WRONG MY LAD SAID I
BUT IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO BE GOING
AND THERE WAS ANOTHER LESS HATEFUL BUT STILL MORE TIRESOME BECAUSE SHE FAVOURED HIM AND WAS ALWAYS THRUSTING HIM UPON ME AND SOUNDING HIS PRAISES IN MY EARS--MR BOARHAM BY NAME BORE'EM AS I PREFER SPELLING IT FOR A TERRIBLE BORE HE WAS
TRUE OR FALSE YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO BLAME HER YOU KNOW NOR HIM EITHER
IF HE HAS DONE AMISS I SHALL CONSIDER MY LIFE WELL SPENT IN SAVING HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS EARLY ERRORS AND STRIVING TO RECALL HIM TO THE PATH OF VIRTUE
I REPLIED WITH A LOOK AT WHICH HE PLACIDLY SMILED
THERE WAS NO STILE OR GAP AT HAND BY WHICH I COULD ESCAPE INTO THE FIELDS SO I WALKED QUIETLY ON SAYING TO MYSELF IT MAY NOT BE HE AFTER ALL
BUT TAKE CARE YOU DON'T ROUSE MY HATE INSTEAD
BUT I WOULD DO IT CALMLY
SHE ATTEMPTED TO FLATTER AND FAWN UPON ME AT FIRST BUT I SOON CHECKED THAT
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD VENTURED TO COME WITHIN ITS INCLOSURE SINCE I HAD BEEN LEFT ALONE WITHOUT THE SANCTION OF HIS MOTHER'S OR SISTER'S COMPANY OR AT LEAST THE EXCUSE OF A MESSAGE FROM THEM
YOU THINK ME COLD AND STONY-HEARTED AND YOU MAY BUT I DON'T HELEN WELL NEVER MIND
AND I CAN NEVER NEVER GET OUT OF IT WELL WHAT OF THAT
IF I HAD REASONED WITH HIM LIKE A RATIONAL CREATURE HE SAYS IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
I HAVE NOT DESERVED IT HELEN--I DARE NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH FELICITY
AND AFTER A LITTLE HUMMING AND HAWING HE RETURNED TO THE ATTACK
WELL YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME SAID SHE COMPOSEDLY STARING ME IN THE FACE
IF THERE BE ANY FURTHER CHANGE IT MUST BE FOR THE BETTER AS WE BECOME STILL MORE ACCUSTOMED TO EACH OTHER
AND HOW CRUELLY HE HAS TRAMPLED ON MY LOVE BETRAYED MY TRUST SCORNED MY PRAYERS AND TEARS AND EFFORTS FOR HIS PRESERVATION CRUSHED MY HOPES DESTROYED MY YOUTH'S BEST FEELINGS AND DOOMED ME TO A LIFE OF HOPELESS MISERY AS FAR AS MAN CAN DO IT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SAY THAT I NO LONGER LOVE MY HUSBAND--I HATE HIM
AND IN THE COUNTRY I HAVE CHIEFLY PASSED MY LIFE AND NOW I HOPE YOU ARE SATISFIED
BUT I AM NOT GOING TO DESCANT UPON THEM NOW
AND SINCE I HAVE MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH ARTHUR'S AFFAIRS I HAVE LEARNT TO REGARD THAT AS NO TRIFLING RECOMMENDATION
BUT THEY WERE SUCH AN INTOLERABLE TIME ABOUT IT THAT I COULD WAIT NO LONGER--I THOUGHT MY OWN FEET COULD CARRY ME SOONER
MANY HAD LOST THEIR INTEREST IN HIS EYES AND OTHERS HAD NEVER HAD ANYTHING TO LOSE
HER ARGUMENTS AND ENTREATIES WERE A NUISANCE HER INTERFERENCE WAS AN INSULT SO INTOLERABLE THAT AT LENGTH ON FINDING SHE HAD COVERTLY DILUTED THE PALE PORT THAT WAS BROUGHT HIM HE THREW THE BOTTLE OUT OF THE WINDOW SWEARING HE WOULD NOT BE CHEATED LIKE A BABY ORDERED THE BUTLER ON PAIN OF INSTANT DISMISSAL TO BRING A BOTTLE OF THE STRONGEST WINE IN THE CELLAR AND AFFIRMING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WELL LONG AGO IF HE HAD BEEN LET TO HAVE HIS OWN WAY BUT SHE WANTED TO KEEP HIM WEAK IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE HIM UNDER HER THUMB--BUT BY THE LORD HARRY HE WOULD HAVE NO MORE HUMBUG--SEIZED A GLASS IN ONE HAND AND THE BOTTLE IN THE OTHER AND NEVER RESTED TILL HE HAD DRUNK IT DRY
AND SINCE YOU ARE IN SUCH A MERRY MOOD MISS ELIZA YOU MUST BE GOOD ENOUGH COMPANY FOR YOURSELF
BUT IF I COULD GET A WIFE WITH FORTUNE ENOUGH TO PAY OFF MY DEBTS AND SET ME STRAIGHT IN THE WORLD TO BE SURE SAID I
AND I HAVE HAD SEVERAL INTERVIEWS WITH HIM SINCE
BUT THIS THOUGHT OF FINAL SEPARATION WAS TOO INTOLERABLE
BUT IT COULD NOT BE
INDEED I AM NOT SURE THAT I SUCCEEDED AFTER ALL
ARTHUR THUS RELEASED CREPT BACK TO ME AND PUT HIS HAND IN MINE
BUT I DETERMINED THIS SHOULD NEVER BE AS LONG AS I HAD ANY INFLUENCE LEFT
AND I WAS SUCH A FOOL I COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU
I HAVE SPOKEN PLAINLY
DO YOU MEAN TO TURN FROM THE ERROR OF YOUR WAYS AND BE A GOOD HUSBAND A GOOD FATHER AND SO FORTH
HE THEN DOUBLED HIS FORMER STAKE AND CHALLENGED ANY ONE PRESENT TO PLAY AGAINST HIM
SO FAR FROM IT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ALMOST LUDICROUS IN THE INCONGRUITY OF THIS ADVENTITIOUS FRETFULNESS AND NERVOUS IRRITABILITY RATHER CALCULATED TO EXCITE LAUGHTER THAN ANGER IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE INTENSELY PAINFUL CONSIDERATIONS ATTENDANT UPON THOSE SYMPTOMS OF A DISORDERED FRAME AND HIS TEMPER GRADUALLY IMPROVED AS HIS BODILY HEALTH WAS RESTORED WHICH WAS MUCH SOONER THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE BUT FOR MY STRENUOUS EXERTIONS
ADIEU
BUT I FELT IT TOO DEEPLY TO DO ANYTHING BUT RISE FROM THE MUSIC-STOOL AND THROW MYSELF BACK ON THE SOFA SUPPRESSING WITH DIFFICULTY THE AUDIBLE EXPRESSION OF THE BITTERNESS I FELT WITHIN
AND I DO TRY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
BY THAT MEANS I HOPE TO SAVE HIM FROM ONE DEGRADING VICE AT LEAST
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE IN THE AGONY OF THE MOMENT I ATTEMPTED TO SNATCH IT FROM HIS HAND
BUT NO THANK HEAVEN BOTH MAN AND HORSE WERE GONE AND NOTHING WAS LEFT TO WITNESS AGAINST ME BUT TWO OBJECTS--UNPLEASANT ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES TO BE SURE AND PRESENTING A VERY UGLY NOT TO SAY MURDEROUS APPEARANCE--IN ONE PLACE THE HAT SATURATED WITH RAIN AND COATED WITH MUD INDENTED AND BROKEN ABOVE THE BRIM BY THAT VILLAINOUS WHIP-HANDLE
EVERY HATOM OF HIS WORLDLY GOODS EXCEPT JUST A TRIFLE BY WAY OF REMEMBRANCE TO HIS NEPHEW DOWN IN SHIRE AND AN ANNUITY TO HIS WIFE IT'S STRANGE SIR IT IS SIR
YOU WON'T MIND BUSINESS FOR AN HOUR OR TWO IN A CASE OF THIS SORT WHEN YOUR FRIEND IS AT THE POINT OF DEATH HE IS NOT I TELL YOU FOR ANYTHING YOU KNOW HE MAY BE
I DID NOT INTEND YOU SHOULD HEAR MY SOLILOQUY
IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST I HURRIED OVER TO WILDFELL HALL
AND SHE ASSURES ME IT WILL BE A GOOD THING FOR THE FAMILY AS WELL AS FOR ME
HERE IT IS AND MY FORGIVENESS WITH IT
I HAD MY DARLING SINLESS INOFFENSIVE LITTLE ONE TO CONSOLE ME
SHE MADE NO COMPLAINTS BUT THE TONE OF HER LAST LETTER EVINCED GREAT DEPRESSION OF MIND
AND DOUBTLESS THERE ARE MORE THOUGH I HAVE NEVER KNOWN THEM UNLESS I EXCEPT POOR LORD LOWBOROUGH AND HE WAS BAD ENOUGH IN HIS DAY
I FELT ILL
IN DUE TIME HE BECAME MR MILLWARD'S FIRST AND ONLY CURATE--FOR THAT GENTLEMAN'S DECLINING YEARS FORCED HIM AT LAST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DUTIES OF HIS EXTENSIVE PARISH WERE A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR THOSE VAUNTED ENERGIES WHICH HE WAS WONT TO BOAST OVER HIS YOUNGER AND LESS ACTIVE BRETHREN OF THE CLOTH
AND I KNOW YOU DID YOUR UTMOST TO DELIVER HIM FROM THEM BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS UNTIL I CAME TO YOUR ASSISTANCE
TAKE THE VERSES WRITTEN BY EMILY AT ROEHEAD WHICH CONTAIN THE LOVELY LINES WHICH I HAVE ALREADY QUOTED IN AN EARLIER INTRODUCTION 0 JUST BEFORE THOSE LINES THERE ARE TWO OR THREE VERSES WHICH IT IS WORTH WHILE TO COMPARE WITH A POEM OF ANNE'S CALLED HOME EMILY WAS SIXTEEN AT THE TIME OF WRITING
SHE'S VERY PLAIN THEY SAY AND GETTING ON TO FORTY OR PAST AND SO YOU KNOW IF SHE DIDN'T JUMP AT THIS HOPPORTUNITY SHE THOUGHT SHE'D NEVER GET A BETTER
THE REVEREND MICHAEL MILLWARD HIMSELF WAS A TALL PONDEROUS ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WHO PLACED A SHOVEL HAT ABOVE HIS LARGE SQUARE MASSIVE-FEATURED FACE CARRIED A STOUT WALKING-STICK IN HIS HAND AND INCASED HIS STILL POWERFUL LIMBS IN KNEE-BREECHES AND GAITERS,--OR BLACK SILK STOCKINGS ON STATE OCCASIONS
I HAVE BEEN BUSY I SAID FOR AN APOLOGY WAS EVIDENTLY DEMANDED
FOR I WAS SENSIBLE THAT HELEN WAS STANDING WITHIN A FEW FEET OF ME BESIDE THE FIRE
THIS ROOM WAS STILL HIS FAVOURITE RESORT
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH HELEN I HAD BEEN DELUDING MYSELF WITH THE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD ONE DAY BE MY SISTER
BUT I DID NOT WISH TO CONTRADICT HIM NOW
I MUST KNOW AND THAT QUICKLY
DEUCED BAD WEATHER THIS HE BEGAN
I CAN'T BEAR IT CAN'T BEAR WHAT?--TO BE REMINDED OF THE PROMISES YOU HAVE BROKEN HELEN YOU ARE CRUEL
HOWEVER I BEFRIENDED HIM ON THIS OCCASION AND RECOMMENDED THEM TO LET HIM BE FOR A WHILE INTIMATING THAT WITH A LITTLE PATIENCE ON OUR PARTS HE WOULD SOON COME ROUND AGAIN
I AM NOT GOING TO PRESUME TO TROUBLE YOU WITH THE MENTION OF MY OWN FEELINGS OR YOUR PERFECTIONS BUT I HAVE SOMETHING TO REVEAL TO YOU WHICH YOU OUGHT TO KNOW AND WHICH YET IT PAINS ME INEXPRESSIBLY THEN DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF TO REVEAL IT BUT IT IS OF IMPORTANCE IF SO I SHALL HEAR IT SOON ENOUGH ESPECIALLY IF IT IS BAD NEWS AS YOU SEEM TO CONSIDER IT
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING SO LONG
I'M SORRY TO OFFEND YOU MR MARKHAM SAID SHE BUT UNLESS I PAY FOR THE BOOK I CANNOT TAKE IT AND SHE LAID IT ON THE TABLE
IT WAS ALL VERY FINE IN ITS WAY
AND ON SUNDAY EVERYBODY WONDERED WHETHER OR NOT THE FAIR UNKNOWN WOULD PROFIT BY THE VICAR'S REMONSTRANCE AND COME TO CHURCH
BUT WITH A VIOLENT EFFORT I CHECKED ALL FURTHER SIGNS OF WEAKNESS DRIED MY TEARS AND WHEN I THOUGHT HE HAD TURNED AWAY AGAIN ROSE AND INSTANTLY LEFT THE APARTMENT TAKING REFUGE IN MY FAVOURITE RESORT THE LIBRARY
ON ENTERING THE PARLOUR WE FOUND THAT HONOURED LADY SEATED IN HER ARM-CHAIR AT THE FIRESIDE WORKING AWAY AT HER KNITTING ACCORDING TO HER USUAL CUSTOM WHEN SHE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO
THAT EXCELLENT LADY I AM SURE WILL I HAVE CONSULTED HER
AND I CONFESS I TREMBLED WHEN I SAW HIM HOLDING THEM SO CLOSE TO THE CANDLE AND PORING SO INTENTLY OVER THE SEEMING BLANKS
AS HAPPY AS SOME OTHERS I SUPPOSE ARE YOU AS HAPPY AS YOU DESIRE TO BE NO ONE IS SO BLEST AS THAT COMES TO ON THIS SIDE ETERNITY ONE THING I KNOW RETURNED HE WITH A DEEP SAD SIGH
BUT IN A LITTLE WHILE AFTER SEVERAL PORTENTOUS YAWNS HE PRONOUNCED HIS BOOK TO BE CURSED TRASH AND THREW IT ON THE TABLE
IF YOU KNEW MY PRESENT FEELINGS YOU WOULD EVEN TRY TO RELIEVE THEM AT THE EXPENSE OF YOUR OWN I WILL GO--IN A MINUTE IF THAT CAN RELIEVE YOU--AND NEVER RETURN SAID I WITH BITTER EMPHASIS
BUT HE WOULD FREQUENTLY LOOK INTO THE SCHOOL-ROOM TO SEE HOW LITTLE ARTHUR GOT ON WITH HIS NEW COMPANION WHEN I WAS NOT THERE
BUT THIS WILL BE QUITE A FAMILY CONCERN--EARLY HOURS AND NOBODY HERE BUT OURSELVES AND JUST THE MILLWARDS AND WILSONS MOST OF WHOM YOU ALREADY KNOW AND MR LAWRENCE YOUR LANDLORD WITH WHOM YOU OUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE I DO KNOW SOMETHING OF HIM--BUT YOU MUST EXCUSE ME THIS TIME
FORGIVE ME HELEN PLEADED I
IS HE NOT MY HUSBAND OH HUNTINGDON
DON'T TELL ME NOW
I DID NOT HOWEVER INTEND TO PASS OVER HIS DERELICTIONS THIS TIME WITHOUT A REMARK
I WISH A MILDER WORD WOULD DO
I SEE YOUR HEART IS IN YOUR WORK MRS GRAHAM OBSERVED I
BUT IN ADDITION TO THIS I HAD A GLOOMY CONVICTION THAT THE AWFUL REALITIES SHE HAD SEEN AND FELT HER RECONCILIATION WITH THE MAN SHE HAD ONCE LOVED HIS DREADFUL SUFFERINGS AND DEATH MUST EVENTUALLY EFFACE FROM HER MIND ALL TRACES OF HER PASSING LOVE FOR ME
I MERELY BOWED AND HER COUNTENANCE FELL
AND SURELY I HAVE POWER TO KEEP IT ALIVE
THE DISTANCE WAS LITTLE MORE THAN SIX MILES BUT THE ROAD WAS STRANGE AND I HAD TO KEEP STOPPING TO INQUIRE MY WAY
BUT HE CALLED HER BACK AND INSISTED UPON HER COMING TO HIM
AND EVERY STEP REMOVED US FURTHER FROM THE CHANCE OF THAT
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE THE OTHER AND WELCOME THANK YOU DEAR ANNABELLA
GO I WENT BUT HEARING HIM MUTTER SOMETHING AS I WAS CLOSING THE DOOR I TURNED AGAIN
IT WAS A PLEASURE TO BEHOLD IT SO DEXTEROUSLY GUIDED BY THOSE FAIR AND GRACEFUL FINGERS
THERE--IN WITH YOU
AND HE IS RATHER BETTER AT PRESENT THAN HE WAS WHEN I CAME
ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY I WAS OUT WITH MY DOG AND GUN IN PURSUIT OF SUCH GAME AS I COULD FIND WITHIN THE TERRITORY OF LINDEN-CAR
AND NO MAN BREATHING SHALL HINDER IT,--OR HAS A RIGHT TO INTERFERE BETWEEN US BUT IF YOU KNEW HOW THEY TALK YOU WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL FOR HER SAKE AS WELL AS FOR YOUR OWN
IF YOUR MAMMA THINKS PROPER TO INVITE SUCH PERSONS TO HER HOUSE SHE CANNOT OBJECT TO HER DAUGHTER'S KEEPING COMPANY WITH THEM THIS LATTER CLAUSE WAS ADDED IN A SORT OF SOLILOQUY WHEN ROSE WAS GONE
HE MADE ME A SIGN TO REPLENISH AND QUIETLY PUSHED UP THE BOTTLE
SO NOW MY ANGEL I HOPE I HAVE MADE OUT A CLEAR CASE AND FULLY CONVINCED YOU THAT I CANNOT MAKE THE ATONEMENT YOU REQUIRE
DISAPPOINTED IN HER SEARCH I HEARD HER COME DOWN MORE SLOWLY THAN SHE HAD ASCENDED
I HAVE A FEW PICTURES ALREADY DONE FOR I TOLD RACHEL TO PACK UP ALL I HAD
AND SO IT WAS THIS TIME
ON WHAT POINTS MOTHER ASKED I
SHALL I CALL THIS MAN
I'VE NOT GOT THEM I REPLIED
I HAD TAKEN LITTLE ARTHUR INTO THE WOOD THAT SKIRTS THE PARK AND THERE SEATED HIM ON THE MOSS-CUSHIONED ROOTS OF AN OLD OAK
POOR MILICENT WHAT ENCOURAGEMENT CAN I GIVE YOU
BUT THIS WAS TOO DISAGREEABLE A SUPPOSITION TO BE ENTERTAINED A MOMENT AFTER IT COULD CONVENIENTLY BE DISMISSED
RACHEL HAD MOVED ON DURING OUR CONVERSATION TO SOME YARDS DISTANCE
I WAS A VERY CONSTANT AND ATTENTIVE VISITOR TO HIM THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PERIOD OF HIS ILLNESS AND CONVALESCENCE
THE DEW WAS ON THE GRASS AND TEN THOUSAND GOSSAMERS WERE WAVING IN THE BREEZE
BUT ONE EVENING WHEN WE WERE SITTING OVER OUR WINE AFTER ONE OF OUR CLUB DINNERS AND ALL HAD BEEN HEARTY TOGETHER,--LOWBOROUGH GIVING US MAD TOASTS AND HEARING OUR WILD SONGS AND BEARING A HAND IN THE APPLAUSE IF HE DID NOT HELP US TO SING THEM HIMSELF,--HE SUDDENLY RELAPSED INTO SILENCE SINKING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND AND NEVER LIFTING HIS GLASS TO HIS LIPS;--BUT THIS WAS NOTHING NEW
COME ARTHUR BUT YOU WILL RETURN NOT YET
HE WAS TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED BEFORE SOME TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO
WELL I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT RETURNED I RATHER DOGGEDLY
FEBRUARY 10TH.--IT IS A HARD EMBITTERING THING TO HAVE ONE'S KIND FEELINGS AND GOOD INTENTIONS CAST BACK IN ONE'S TEETH
BUT IT WAS BETTER SHE SHOULD SEEM TO ATTRIBUTE HIS CONDUCT TO THIS THAN TO ANYTHING ELSE
I HARDLY CAN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
THE AFFRONT CONTINUED HARGRAVE TURNING TO ME OWED HALF ITS BITTERNESS TO THE FACT OF ITS BEING OFFERED IN YOUR PRESENCE
BUT TEMPERANCE SIR IS ONE THING AND ABSTINENCE ANOTHER BUT I HAVE HEARD THAT WITH SOME PERSONS TEMPERANCE--THAT IS MODERATION--IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
HE DID NOT NOTICE ME TILL I SPOKE AND THEN HE MISTOOK ME FOR ANOTHER
CHAPTER VI DURING THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS I DID NOT ENTER MRS GRAHAM'S HOUSE NOR SHE MINE
AND WHEN I EXPRESS MY HORROR AND INDIGNATION HE LAYS IT ALL TO THE CHARGE OF JEALOUSY AND LAUGHS TILL THE TEARS RUN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
BUT SHE MUST KNOW YOU HERSELF AND LEARN TO LIKE YOU
NOW THAT'S A GOOD HONEST ANSWER--WONDERFUL FOR A GIRL!--WELL I'LL WRITE TO YOUR FATHER TO-MORROW
I BLUSH FOR HIM I FEAR FOR HIM
BUT BE QUIET A MINUTE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I CAME FOR UNTHINKINGLY I ADVANCED A STEP OR TWO NEARER
AT LAST ONE EVENING WHEN WE WERE MOST OF US ASSEMBLED TOGETHER AGAIN HE ENTERED SILENT AND GRIM AS A GHOST AND WOULD HAVE QUIETLY SLIPPED INTO HIS USUAL SEAT AT MY ELBOW BUT WE ALL ROSE TO WELCOME HIM AND SEVERAL VOICES WERE RAISED TO ASK WHAT HE WOULD HAVE AND SEVERAL HANDS WERE BUSY WITH BOTTLE AND GLASS TO SERVE HIM
HE WAS NOT ABLE TO MOUNT HIS PONY TILL A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE DATE OF OUR RECONCILIATION
BUT LET ME IMPLORE YOU TO FORGET AND FORGIVE MY RASH PRESUMPTION AND THINK OF ME AS IF THOSE WORDS HAD NEVER BEEN SPOKEN
YOU MUST KNOW WHY I TELL YOU SO SHE RESUMED
MY LITTLE ARTHUR LIVES AND THRIVES
BAD LUCK COULD NOT LAST FOR EVER
HAD I FORGOTTEN MY OWN PROSPECTS MY ARDENT LOVE MY PERTINACIOUS HOPES
I AM EXERTING MY UTMOST ENDEAVOURS TO PROMOTE THE RECOVERY AND REFORMATION OF MY HUSBAND AND IF I SUCCEED WHAT SHALL I DO
IF YOU LIKE WAS THE REPLY
YOU SEE THERE IS A SAD DEARTH OF SUBJECTS OBSERVED THE FAIR ARTIST
AND YET TO BE SILENT WAS TO LEAVE HIM A PREY TO HIS OWN REGRETS AND APPREHENSIONS
IS IT NOTHING TO TRIFLE WITH YOUR FRIEND'S FEELINGS AND MINE--TO ENDEAVOUR TO STEAL A WOMAN'S AFFECTIONS FROM HER HUSBAND--WHAT HE VALUES MORE THAN HIS GOLD AND THEREFORE WHAT IT IS MORE DISHONEST TO TAKE
I WISH I KNEW COME TAKE YOUR TEA ELIZA AND DON'T BE FOOLISH RESPONDED I HANDING HER THE SUGAR AND CREAM
HAD SHE BEEN OTHER THAN SHE WAS I SHOULD HAVE FELT HER PRESENCE A GREAT RELIEF TO COME BETWEEN US THUS EXCEPT INDEED THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY ASHAMED FOR ANY DECENT PERSON TO SEE HIM AS HE OFTEN WAS
I HAD NEVER ONCE ATTEMPTED TO PREJUDICE HIS CHILD AGAINST HIM
VERY MUCH AGAINST MY OWN BECAUSE I LEFT HIM BEHIND
I RATHER THOUGHT OUR PRETTY HOSTESS WOULD BE SETTING UP HER PORCUPINE QUILLS AND THREATENING TO TURN US OUT OF THE HOUSE IF WE DIDN'T MIND OUR MANNERS YOU DIDN'T FORESEE THIS THEN ANSWERED GRIMSBY WITH A GUTTURAL CHUCKLE
THE CHILD A LITTLE BOY APPARENTLY ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD SCRAMBLED UP TO THE TOP OF THE WALL AND CALLED AGAIN AND AGAIN
SECONDLY HE IS NARROW-MINDED AND BIGOTED IN THE EXTREME
AUGUST 20TH.--WE ARE SHAKEN DOWN AGAIN TO ABOUT OUR USUAL POSITION
AND I COULD HAVE WEPT WITH PURE VEXATION
AND DID LORD LOWBOROUGH PROFIT BY YOUR ADVICE I ASKED
YOU SEE I KNOW THE ADDRESS AND I MIGHT WRITE TO HER MYSELF BUT I AM SO VIRTUOUS AS TO REFRAIN WELL I'LL DO THIS FOR YOU MARKHAM AND AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE AN ANSWER YOU'LL LET ME KNOW IF ALL BE WELL I'LL COME MYSELF AND TELL YOU IMMEDIATELY CHAPTER XLVIII FIVE OR SIX DAYS AFTER THIS MR LAWRENCE PAID US THE HONOUR OF A CALL
TO REFER TO THE FUTURE WAS TO INCREASE HIS ANGUISH
I WAS BEGINNING TO RELENT TOWARDS MY WRETCHED PARTNER
SOME EVEN RIDICULED IT--BUT IN THIS THEIR FOLLY WAS MORE APPARENT THAN HIS
HIS MAKER HAS ENDOWED HIM WITH REASON AND CONSCIENCE AS WELL AS THE REST OF US
THEY HAVE GAINED AND KEPT A PLACE IN ENGLISH RELIGIOUS VERSE AND THEY MUST ALWAYS APPEAL TO THOSE WHO LOVE THE BRONTES BECAUSE IN THE LANGUAGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH AND SUBMISSION THEY RECORD THE DEATH OF EMILY AND THE PASSIONATE AFFECTION WHICH HER SISTERS BORE HER
THERE WILL BE THE TOTAL LOSS OF YOUR OWN HEALTH AND OF MY AFFECTION TOO IF THAT IS OF ANY VALUE TO YOU WHAT
AND THAT WHEN THE WELL-BEING AND CULTURE OF MY SON IS ALL I HAVE TO LIVE FOR I SHOULD SEE MY INFLUENCE DESTROYED BY ONE WHOSE SELFISH AFFECTION IS MORE INJURIOUS THAN THE COLDEST INDIFFERENCE OR THE HARSHEST TYRANNY COULD BE
HOW DIFFERENT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HEAR ME NOW THEN ARTHUR SAID I GENTLY PRESSING HIS HAND
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS MRS MARKHAM SAID HE
WE SHALL MEET IN HEAVEN
BUT INSTEAD OF BORING YOU WITH MY CHAGRIN MY EXPECTATIONS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS MY FLUCTUATIONS OF DULL DESPONDENCY AND FLICKERING HOPE MY VARYING RESOLUTIONS NOW TO DROP IT AND NOW TO PERSEVERE--NOW TO MAKE A BOLD PUSH AND NOW TO LET THINGS PASS AND PATIENTLY ABIDE MY TIME,--I WILL EMPLOY MYSELF IN SETTLING THE BUSINESS OF ONE OR TWO OF THE CHARACTERS INTRODUCED IN THE COURSE OF THIS NARRATIVE WHOM I MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO MENTION AGAIN
AND HAVING GATHERED A HANDFUL OF BLUEBELLS AND WILD-ROSES I WAS KNEELING BEFORE HIM AND PRESENTING THEM ONE BY ONE TO THE GRASP OF HIS TINY FINGERS
WELL IT MUST BE AFFECTATION HE WOULD NOT HEAR OF MY ATTENDING THE FUNERAL OR GOING FOR A DAY OR TWO TO CHEER POOR FREDERICK'S SOLITUDE
THAT TOO WAS PUT INTO MY HANDS WITHOUT A REMARK AND THESE ARE ITS CONTENTS DEC
BUT I MUST GIVE HER SOME EXPLANATION OF THAT EXTRAORDINARY STEP I HAD TAKEN
I HAD NEARLY TWO STAGES YET BEFORE ME BUT THE COACH I WAS INFORMED PASSED THROUGH THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF STANINGLEY AND HAVING DESIRED TO BE SET DOWN AS NEAR THE HALL AS POSSIBLE I HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO SIT WITH FOLDED ARMS AND SPECULATE UPON THE COMING HOUR
BUT YOU I MAY NOT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING AGAIN FOR I KNOW NOT HOW LONG WHAT WAS ARTHUR DOING WHEN YOU CAME AWAY HE WAS WITH MISS MILLWARD WHERE YOU LEFT HIM--ALL RIGHT BUT HOPING MAMMA WOULD NOT BE LONG AWAY
BUT I HAD NOT BEEN SO OCCUPIED TWO MINUTES BEFORE VOICES AND LAUGHTER AND GLIMPSES OF MOVING OBJECTS THROUGH THE TREES INFORMED ME THAT THE WHOLE COMPANY HAD TURNED OUT TO TAKE AN AIRING IN THE GARDEN TOO
WHY CANNOT YOU BECAUSE,'--SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED AT THE CARPET
WELL THEN NO EXCLAIMED HIS LORDSHIP WITH DEEP DETERMINED EMPHASIS
FOR MRS GRAHAM THOUGH SHE SAID LITTLE TO ANY PURPOSE AND APPEARED SOMEWHAT SELF-OPINIONATED SEEMED NOT INCAPABLE OF REFLECTION,--THOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE HAD BEEN ALL HER LIFE POOR THING FOR SHE BETRAYED A LAMENTABLE IGNORANCE ON CERTAIN POINTS AND HAD NOT EVEN THE SENSE TO BE ASHAMED OF IT
HE WILL BE DAMNED WON'T HE MRS HUNTINGDON IF HE DOESN'T FORGIVE HIS BROTHER'S TRESPASSES YOU OUGHT TO FORGIVE HIM MR HARGRAVE SINCE HE ASKS YOU SAID I
MORTIFICATION HAS COMMENCED
I HAD TAKEN TOO MUCH WINE AND I WAS SCARCELY MYSELF AT THE TIME YOU OFTEN TAKE TOO MUCH
MR HUNTINGDON WHO WAS LOUNGING AGAINST THE TABLE EXULTING IN HIS OWN TREACHEROUS VILLAINY AND LAUGHING HIS VICTIM TO SCORN AND MR GRIMSBY STANDING BY QUIETLY RUBBING HIS HANDS AND CHUCKLING WITH FIENDISH SATISFACTION
JUST STEP ASIDE INTO THIS OTHER FIELD SHE GLANCED AT THE REAPERS SOME OF WHOM WERE DIRECTING LOOKS OF IMPERTINENT CURIOSITY TOWARDS HER
SHE SAW ME TOO AND CONFRONTED ME WITH A LOOK OF HARD DEFIANCE
YOU JUDGE HIM UNCHARITABLY AUNT I KNOW SAID I
ARE YOU THERE STILL MR MARKHAM SAID SHE AT LENGTH LOOKING ROUND UPON ME--FOR I WAS SEATED A LITTLE BEHIND ON A MOSSY PROJECTION OF THE CLIFF.--'WHY DON'T YOU GO AND AMUSE YOURSELF WITH YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE I AM TIRED OF THEM LIKE YOU
THEY DEPARTED EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE ANY ONE ELSE WAS DOWN EXCEPT MYSELF AND JUST AS I WAS LEAVING MY ROOM LORD LOWBOROUGH WAS DESCENDING TO TAKE HIS PLACE IN THE CARRIAGE WHERE HIS LADY WAS ALREADY ENSCONCED
BUT IF WE MAY NEVER MEET AND NEVER HOPE TO MEET AGAIN IS IT A CRIME TO EXCHANGE OUR THOUGHTS BY LETTER
I NOTICED THAT HE COLOURED UP TO THE TEMPLES GAVE US ONE FURTIVE GLANCE IN PASSING AND WALKED ON LOOKING GRAVE BUT SEEMINGLY OFFERING NO REPLY TO HER REMARKS
BUT COME NOW--WOULD YOU RATHER BE AN OLD MAID--LET ALONE THE PAUPER I CAN'T TELL TILL I'M ASKED AND I LEFT THE ROOM IMMEDIATELY TO ESCAPE FURTHER EXAMINATION
IS IT TO BE THE LAST LOWBOROUGH SAID I STEPPING UP TO HIM
SHE HAD GIVEN SOME USEFUL ADVICE WHICH SHE HOPED WOULD NOT BE THROWN AWAY
BUT HE CUT ME SHORT BY SAYING IT WAS NO USE BOTHERING ABOUT THE MATTER FOR HE HAD ENGAGED A GOVERNESS ALREADY AND SHE WAS COMING NEXT WEEK
AND DON'T ARGUE AGAINST ME ANY MORE
AND I COUNSEL YOU TO KEEP THEM STILL IN VIEW TRUST ME I WILL
THE COMPANY CONSISTED OF MRS AND MASTER GRAHAM MARY AND ELIZA MILLWARD JANE AND RICHARD WILSON AND ROSE FERGUS AND GILBERT MARKHAM
IT SEEMS AS IF I SHOULD FEEL HER DISAPPOINTMENT EVEN MORE DEEPLY THAN MY OWN
HE WAS HERE THEN SAFELY CLASPED IN MY ARMS AND MANY LEAGUES AWAY FROM HIS UNWORTHY FATHER
AND WHEN I REGRET THIS TENDENCY OF HIS IT IS FOR HIS OWN SAKE NOT FOR MINE
AND IF HE HAD KEPT HIS DISTANCE I NEVER WOULD HAVE HATED HIM
I FEARED TO INTRUDE TO INTRUDE CRIED SHE WITH AN IMPATIENT GESTURE
ONLY LET THE STORMY SEVERITY OF THIS WINTER WEATHER BE SOMEWHAT ABATED AND THEN SOME MORNING MR HUNTINGDON WILL COME DOWN TO A SOLITARY BREAKFAST-TABLE AND PERHAPS BE CLAMOURING THROUGH THE HOUSE FOR HIS INVISIBLE WIFE AND CHILD WHEN THEY ARE SOME FIFTY MILES ON THEIR WAY TO THE WESTERN WORLD OR IT MAY BE MORE
AND TELL THOSE GENTLEMEN I CONTINUED--'THESE MEN WHETHER OR NOT I YIELDED TO YOUR SOLICITATIONS I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU MRS HUNTINGDON YOU DO UNDERSTAND ME SIR
AND I DON'T THINK HE WOULD OBJECT TO ANYTHING FOR ME THAT SHE THOUGHT PROPER TO SANCTION BUT WOULD HE SANCTION ANYTHING TO WHICH SHE THOUGHT PROPER TO OBJECT NO I DON'T THINK HE CARES ENOUGH ABOUT ME HE IS VERY MUCH TO BLAME--BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT AN ANGEL HE HAS FOR HIS DAUGHTER--WHICH IS ALL THE BETTER FOR ME AS IF HE DID HE WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO PART WITH SUCH A TREASURE AND MR HUNTINGDON SAID I I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW I AM NOT AN HEIRESS HE PROTESTED HE HAD NEVER GIVEN IT A THOUGHT AND BEGGED I WOULD NOT DISTURB HIS PRESENT ENJOYMENT BY THE MENTION OF SUCH UNINTERESTING SUBJECTS
MEANTIME MY BRAIN WAS ON FIRE WITH INDIGNATION AND MY HEART SEEMED READY TO BURST FROM ITS PRISON WITH CONFLICTING PASSIONS
KEEP A GUARD OVER YOUR EYES AND EARS AS THE INLETS OF YOUR HEART AND OVER YOUR LIPS AS THE OUTLET LEST THEY BETRAY YOU IN A MOMENT OF UNWARINESS
AT LAST MR HUNTINGDON'S LIGHT PHAETON CAME BOWLING MERRILY UP THE LAWN
MUCH TO THE SAME EFFECT BUT A LITTLE MORE CONFIDENTIAL AS BEFITTED OUR LONGER INTIMACY AND HER GREATER EXPERIENCE AND BETTER ACQUAINTANCE WITH MY CIRCUMSTANCES
SHE WAS TRUSTED AND VALUED BY HER FATHER LOVED AND COURTED BY ALL DOGS CATS CHILDREN AND POOR PEOPLE AND SLIGHTED AND NEGLECTED BY EVERYBODY ELSE
HIS EXCESSIVE RESERVE UPON ALL HIS OWN CONCERNS WAS INDEED PROVOKING AND CHILLY ENOUGH
THERE IS NO HELP FOR HIM NOW
WHAT CAN YOU DO
AND THE RESTRAINT ONCE BROKEN SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES MIGHT ENSUE
HE SHOULD LEND ME THE MONEY TO BEGIN WITH AND I WOULD PAY HIM BACK AND LIVE IN LOWLY INDEPENDENCE AND STRICT SECLUSION FOR THE HOUSE STANDS IN A LONELY PLACE AND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IS THINLY INHABITED AND HE HIMSELF SHOULD NEGOTIATE THE SALE OF MY PICTURES FOR ME
AND IF YOU STILL RETAIN YOUR WISH TO WRITE TO ME AND THINK YOU CAN MAINTAIN A CORRESPONDENCE ALL THOUGHT ALL SPIRIT--SUCH AS DISEMBODIED SOULS OR UNIMPASSIONED FRIENDS AT LEAST MIGHT HOLD,--WRITE AND I WILL ANSWER YOU SIX MONTHS YES TO GIVE YOUR PRESENT ARDOUR TIME TO COOL AND TRY THE TRUTH AND CONSTANCY OF YOUR SOUL'S LOVE FOR MINE
WHEN I WROTE STERNLY AND COLDLY AS I CONFESS I FREQUENTLY DID AT THE LAST HE BLAMED MY HARSHNESS AND SAID IT WAS ENOUGH TO SCARE HIM FROM HIS HOME
ON RAISING HIS EYES HE BEHELD ME AND DROPPED THEM AGAIN CONFOUNDED AND DISMAYED
I SHALL LEAVE THIS PLACE AS SOON AS I HAVE MEANS TO SEEK ANOTHER ASYLUM
ARE YOU VERY ANGRY HELEN MURMURED HE
MY TONGUE CLEAVED TO THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH
FOOL THAT I WAS TO DREAM THAT I HAD STRENGTH AND PURITY ENOUGH TO SAVE MYSELF AND HIM
IT'S WELL THESE WOMEN MUST BE BLABBING
WERE YOU COMING TO SEE US OR ONLY PASSING BY ASKED THE LOW VOICE OF ITS OWNER WHO I FELT WAS ATTENTIVELY SURVEYING MY COUNTENANCE FROM BEHIND THE THICK BLACK VEIL WHICH WITH THE SHADOWING PANELS ENTIRELY CONCEALED HER OWN FROM ME
I PERFECTLY ADORE HER
AND I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO DO BETTER ANOTHER TIME FOR I LOVE TO GIVE INNOCENT PLEASURE
HE WAS TUMBLING OFF THE WALL THERE
SHE MIGHT BE ONLY TRYING TO FORGET
HE MADE NO ANSWER AND THE MEAL WAS CONCLUDED IN SILENCE
BUT THEY COULD NOT DIM HER IMAGE IN MY MIND OR MAR THE VIVID RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAD BEEN SAID AND FELT BETWEEN US OR DESTROY THE KEEN ANTICIPATION OF WHAT WAS TO BE
BUT EITHER HE MUST CONTRIVE TO RETAIN THEM WITHIN IT OR BREATHE THEM FORTH IN OTHER EARS THAN MINE
HE COULDN'T HELP IT ARTHUR SAID I
AND I'M COME--STOP NOW
THE PREMATURE DEATHS OF TWO AT LEAST OF THE SISTERS--ALL THE GREAT POSSIBILITIES OF THEIR EARTHLY LIVES SNAPPED SHORT--MAY BE DATED FROM MIDSUMMER 1845 THE FACTS AS WE NOW KNOW THEM HARDLY BEAR OUT SO STRONG A JUDGMENT
IT IS DASHED WITH A BITTERNESS THAT I CANNOT HIDE FROM MYSELF DISGUISE IT AS I WILL
HOWEVER I INSISTED UPON CONSULTING MY AUNT ABOUT THE TIME OF THE WEDDING FOR I DETERMINED HER COUNSELS SHOULD NOT BE UTTERLY DISREGARDED
THE WARMLY-TINTED CHEEKS WERE EMBELLISHED WITH A LUXURIANT GROWTH OF REDDISH WHISKERS
AND THOUGH YOU COULD NOT OF COURSE PERUSE IT WITH HALF THE INTEREST THAT I DID I KNOW YOU WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH AN ABBREVIATION OF ITS CONTENTS AND YOU SHALL HAVE THE WHOLE SAVE PERHAPS A FEW PASSAGES HERE AND THERE OF MERELY TEMPORARY INTEREST TO THE WRITER OR SUCH AS WOULD SERVE TO ENCUMBER THE STORY RATHER THAN ELUCIDATE IT
SOMEWHAT TO HIS WIFE'S ASTONISHMENT HE LIFTED HER OFF FROM THE GROUND AND SALUTED HER WITH A HEARTY KISS AND A STRONG EMBRACE
MRS GRAHAM AND I WERE NOW ESTABLISHED FRIENDS--OR BROTHER AND SISTER AS WE RATHER CHOSE TO CONSIDER OURSELVES
HIS TALK DISTRACTED ME FOR I WAS DRIVEN TO EXTREMITIES
NOW WHEN HE FINDS THE CONVENIENCE OF HER PRESENCE HE WILL MAKE ALL MANNER OF LYING SPEECHES AND FALSE FAIR PROMISES FOR THE FUTURE AND SHE WILL BELIEVE HIM AND THEN HER CONDITION WILL BE TEN TIMES WORSE AND TEN TIMES MORE IRREMEDIABLE THAN BEFORE THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE MUCH GROUND FOR SUCH APPREHENSIONS AT PRESENT SAID HE PRODUCING A LETTER FROM HIS POCKET
THE LADY WAS SEATED IN A STIFF HIGH-BACKED ARM-CHAIR WITH A SMALL ROUND TABLE CONTAINING A DESK AND A WORK-BASKET ON ONE SIDE OF HER AND HER LITTLE BOY ON THE OTHER WHO STOOD LEANING HIS ELBOW ON HER KNEE AND READING TO HER WITH WONDERFUL FLUENCY FROM A SMALL VOLUME THAT LAY IN HER LAP
OF HER LONG UNBROKEN SILENCE
THE SCENE REPRESENTED WAS AN OPEN GLADE IN A WOOD
BUT I THINK I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR SUSPICIONS IN THAT RESPECT ARE UTTERLY MISPLACED
IF YOU KNEW YOUR OWN VALUE AS I DO YOU WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT
BUT HE ONLY SMILED AND MURMURED TIME WILL SHOW WE SET TO WORK
WHEN HE WOKE UP ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTER HE CALLED IT TO HIM AGAIN BUT DASH ONLY LOOKED SHEEPISH AND WAGGED THE TIP OF HIS TAIL
I NEED NOT REPEAT ALL WE SAID
ALAS FOR HUMAN CONSTANCY
IF YOU HAD TOLD ME BEFORE THAT YOU HAD ANYTHING TO DO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HALF DONE BEFORE THIS
IT WAS WITH AN AGITATED BURNING HEART AND BRAIN THAT I HURRIED HOMEWARDS REGARDLESS OF THAT SCORCHING NOONDAY SUN--FORGETFUL OF EVERYTHING BUT HER I HAD JUST LEFT--REGRETTING NOTHING BUT HER IMPENETRABILITY AND MY OWN PRECIPITANCY AND WANT OF TACT--FEARING NOTHING BUT HER HATEFUL RESOLUTION AND MY INABILITY TO OVERCOME IT--HOPING NOTHING--BUT HALT,--I WILL NOT BORE YOU WITH MY CONFLICTING HOPES AND FEARS--MY SERIOUS COGITATIONS AND RESOLVES
I RUSHED OUT TO COOL MY BRAIN IN THE BALMY EVENING AIR AND TO COMPOSE MY MIND OR INDULGE MY PASSIONATE THOUGHTS IN THE SOLITUDE OF THE GARDEN
IF YOU CANNOT SEE ME WITHOUT TORMENTING ME AS YOU HAVE LATELY DONE I WOULD GLADLY SAY FAREWELL AND NEVER SEE YOU MORE HE MADE NO ANSWER BUT BENDING FROM HIS HORSE HELD OUT HIS HAND TOWARDS ME
IS IT INTERESTING YES VERY I WENT ON READING OR PRETENDING TO READ AT LEAST--I CANNOT SAY THERE WAS MUCH COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MY EYES AND MY BRAIN
YOURS IMMUTABLY GILBERT MARKHAM
HE DID NOT ARRIVE TILL SOME TIME AFTER THE REST WERE ASSEMBLED
FOR MR MAXWELL I AM CERTAIN CAN REFUSE YOU NOTHING WE WILL TALK OF THIS TO-MORROW SIR SAID MY AUNT COLDLY
AND SOME THROUGH CARELESSNESS HAVE BEEN THE WRETCHED VICTIMS OF DECEIT
THE EASEL AND THE PAINTING APPARATUS WOULD SERVE AS AN EXCUSE FOR ABANDONING THE DRAWING-ROOM IF MY AUNT SHOULD COME TO COMPLAIN OF THE DESERTION AND BESIDES I WANTED TO FINISH THE PICTURE
IF YOU SHOULD MARRY THE HANDSOMEST AND MOST ACCOMPLISHED AND SUPERFICIALLY AGREEABLE MAN IN THE WORLD YOU LITTLE KNOW THE MISERY THAT WOULD OVERWHELM YOU IF AFTER ALL YOU SHOULD FIND HIM TO BE A WORTHLESS REPROBATE OR EVEN AN IMPRACTICABLE FOOL BUT WHAT ARE ALL THE POOR FOOLS AND REPROBATES TO DO AUNT
I USED TO FLY INTO PASSIONS OR MELT INTO TEARS AT FIRST BUT SEEING THAT HIS DELIGHT INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO MY ANGER AND AGITATION I HAVE SINCE ENDEAVOURED TO SUPPRESS MY FEELINGS AND RECEIVE HIS REVELATIONS IN THE SILENCE OF CALM CONTEMPT
AND HE THE MOST INJURIOUS OF THE WHOLE HIS CHILD'S WORST ENEMY WOULD STILL REMAIN
THOUGH MY MOTHER DECLARED SHE DID NOT REGRET THE JOURNEY FOR IF SHE HAD NOT GAINED MUCH GOOD SHE FLATTERED HERSELF SHE HAD IMPARTED SOME AND THAT WAS BETTER
AND I KNOW IT WOULD BE UNPARDONABLE WEAKNESS TO GIVE UP ALL OTHER INTERESTS FOR HIM
BUT WHILE I WAS DISENGAGING MY HABIT FROM THE CRUTCH HE LIFTED ME OFF AND HELD ME BY BOTH HANDS ASSERTING THAT HE WOULD NOT LET ME GO TILL I HAD FORGIVEN HIM
I SHALL JOIN THEM
NAY SPOKEN TO ME AND OF ME
FOR BAD AS HE IS HE IS PART OF MYSELF AND YOU CANNOT ABUSE HIM WITHOUT OFFENDING ME PARDON ME THEN FOR I WOULD SOONER DIE THAN OFFEND YOU
I WILL GLADLY TAKE IT IF YOU WILL LET ME PAY FOR IT I TOLD HER THE EXACT PRICE AND THE COST OF THE CARRIAGE BESIDES IN AS CALM A TONE AS I COULD COMMAND--FOR IN FACT I WAS READY TO WEEP WITH DISAPPOINTMENT AND VEXATION
I DID NOT WISH TO SHOCK HER WITH MY PRESENCE NOW BUT I HAD NOT POWER TO MOVE AWAY
THAT WAS THE FIRST ATTRACTION CERTAINLY
THE MALE FOOLS AND REPROBATES WILL NEVER WANT FOR PARTNERS WHILE THERE ARE SO MANY OF THE OTHER SEX TO MATCH THEM
PLEASE SIR HE SAYS IT WOULD BE A DEAL BETTER IF YOU COULD PERSISTED JOHN FOR HE HOPES THERE'LL BE A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER SHORTLY AND HE SAYS IT'S NOT LIKELY WHEN A HORSE IS SO BAD WITH A COLD AND PHYSICKED AND ALL DEVIL TAKE THE HORSE CRIED THE GENTLEMAN
AND I HAD MUCH ADO TO CALM HER APPREHENSIONS OF SOME DISASTROUS MYSTERY
THEN SUDDENLY TURNING TO ME AND FIXING HIS SHY HAZEL EYES UPON ME WITH A STEADY PENETRATING GAZE HE ADDED THEN YOU HAVE CHANGED YOUR MIND I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE EXACTLY
SPEAK UP SIR
DON'T YOU ENVY ME OH DEAR NO SHE EXCLAIMED
THE CHILD HESITATED AS IF UNWILLING TO QUIT MY SIDE
BESIDES THIS I WOULD CONTRIVE TO DISPOSE OF MY JEWELS NOT THE FAMILY JEWELS BUT THE FEW I BROUGHT WITH ME FROM HOME AND THOSE MY UNCLE GAVE ME ON MY MARRIAGE
AND AS THAT CAN NEVER BE DONE IT IS MORE VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT PERHAPS YOU CANNOT DO IT TO SATISFY YOURSELF BUT YOU MAY AND DO SUCCEED IN DELIGHTING OTHERS WITH THE RESULT OF YOUR ENDEAVOURS WELL AFTER ALL I SHOULD NOT COMPLAIN
SHE UNDERSTOOD IT INSTINCTIVELY AND THIS TIME SHE YIELDED TOO--OR RATHER THERE WAS NOTHING SO DELIBERATE AS REQUESTING OR YIELDING IN THE MATTER
SOMETIMES HE ENDEAVOURS TO CHEER HIM WITH TALK ABOUT OLD TIMES AND THIS AT ONE TIME MAY SERVE TO DIVERT THE SUFFERER FROM HIS OWN SAD THOUGHTS
AND I DOUBT WHETHER SHE WILL NOT DECEIVE HIM AFTER ALL
I KNEW NOT HOW IT WAS TO BE DONE
BUT AS IT IS HE CONTRIVES TO APPEAR SO REALLY KIND AND THOUGHTFUL THAT I CANNOT DO SO WITHOUT RUDENESS AND SEEMING INGRATITUDE
SUCH IT SEEMS WAS THE CASE WITH MOST OF THESE
THE OTHER DAY HE NEARLY FRACTURED MY SKULL FOR SINGING A PRETTY INOFFENSIVE LOVE-SONG ON PURPOSE TO AMUSE HIM OH GILBERT
BUT THAT YOU WON'T BELIEVE
AND HOW MERRY HE IS THIS MORNING HE APPROACHED THE CHILD AND STOOPED TO TAKE HIS HAND
MRS GREAVES BENSON EVERY DECENT SERVANT HAD LEFT AND THOSE THAT WERE COME TO SUPPLY THEIR PLACES WERE A NEGLIGENT DISORDERLY SET TO SAY NO WORSE--I MUST CHANGE THEM AGAIN IF I STAY
AND I WISHED TO HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ON THE MATTER
SOME A NATIVE OF THE NORTH COUNTRY AND SOME OF THE SOUTH
I SAW DISTINCTLY THE PURE MOON SHINING ON AND THE LIGHT CLOUDS SKIMMING THE CLEAR DARK SKY
HOW WILL HE GREET ME I WONDER SAID MY BOUNDING HEART
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO CARE FOR YOU
PERHAPS I COULD GET SOMETHING MORE OUT OF HIM THEN
I AM OBLIGED TO BE A LITTLE STIFF WITH HIM SOMETIMES OR HE WOULD MAKE A COMPLETE SLAVE OF ME
LET THEM GO TO--WHERE THEY BELONG TO SPEAK POLITELY
AND SHE LOOKED HASTILY ROUND--ANY OTHER LADY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WOULD HAVE SCREAMED UNDER SUCH A SUDDEN ALARM
AS FOR JANE WILSON SHE OF COURSE WAS DISAPPOINTED AND EMBITTERED BY THE SUDDEN COLD NEGLECT AND ULTIMATE DESERTION OF HER FORMER ADMIRER
TO WHAT AM I INDEBTED FOR THIS FAVOUR MR MARKHAM SAID SHE WITH SUCH SEVERE BUT QUIET DIGNITY AS ALMOST DISCONCERTED ME
SUCCEED OR FAIL IT WILL BE BETTER THAN RUSHING HEADLONG TO DESTRUCTION AT THAT D-D CLUB
YOU COULD NOT HAVE ENLIGHTENED ME FURTHER ON THE SUBJECT WHICH ALONE CONCERNED ME
MY EYES WANDERED OVER THE PAGES BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BIND MY THOUGHTS TO THEIR CONTENTS
OR I MIGHT HAVE LACKED THE SENSE OR THE POWER TO CARRY MY POINT LIKE A MAN AS I HAVE DONE LEAVING HIM TO HIS SELF-CONGRATULATIONS I ROSE TO SECURE MY MANUSCRIPT FOR I NOW REMEMBERED IT HAD BEEN LEFT UPON THE DRAWING-ROOM TABLE AND I DETERMINED IF POSSIBLE TO SAVE MYSELF THE HUMILIATION OF SEEING IT IN HIS HANDS AGAIN
THERE MIGHT BE IT IS TRUE A LITTLE TOO MUCH CARELESS BOLDNESS IN HIS MANNER AND ADDRESS BUT I WAS IN SO GOOD A HUMOUR AND SO GRATEFUL FOR MY LATE DELIVERANCE FROM MR BOARHAM THAT IT DID NOT ANGER ME
AND SITTING DOWN BEFORE THE TABLE OPENED OUT MY PRIZE AND DELIVERED MYSELF UP TO ITS PERUSAL--FIRST HASTILY TURNING OVER THE LEAVES AND SNATCHING A SENTENCE HERE AND THERE AND THEN SETTING MYSELF STEADILY TO READ IT THROUGH
BUT ON FURTHER CONTEMPLATION I CONCLUDED IT WAS ONLY IN IMAGINATION
THAT HE SHOULD BE ALONE I ATTEMPTED NO REPLY FOR I WAS NOT SURE THAT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE DID NOT PARTLY CONDUCE TO MY DISTRACTION
